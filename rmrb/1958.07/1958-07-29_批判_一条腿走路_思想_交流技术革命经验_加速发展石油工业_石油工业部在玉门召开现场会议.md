Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 28th – China's petroleum industry is determined to catch up with the steel industry at high speed, and strive to remove the label of backwardness in the petroleum industry in the shortest possible time. This is the fighting goal proposed at the on-site conference held by the Ministry of Petroleum Industry in Yumen Oil Mine from July 9th to 22nd.

Based on the new situation of the great leap forward in the national steel and machinery industries, and the new developments in natural petroleum exploration, this conference re-planned the production level of natural petroleum in the second five-year plan, and formulated indicators for the increase in oil production.

The conference believes that in order to accelerate the leap forward in the petroleum industry, it is necessary to further criticize the past method of "walking on one leg" in running the petroleum industry, and vigorously implement the policy of "the whole party and the whole people running petroleum." The so-called "walking on one leg" means that in running the petroleum industry, only the "exclusive operation" of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry was paid attention to, and the simultaneous efforts of the central government and local authorities were ignored; only the construction of large-scale, modern, and high-standard natural oil mines was paid attention to, while the simultaneous efforts of large, medium, and small enterprises were ignored; in technology, only foreign methods were paid attention to, while the combination of indigenous and foreign methods was ignored. According to this spirit, representatives from Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yumen, Qinghai, and other regions have formulated plans to actively assist local development of the petroleum industry, and decided to use the existing petroleum industry departments in these regions as the main force, and vigorously train local petroleum industrial forces as "militia". With this method of "main force plus militia," they will work hard, do more, and do it quickly to make the petroleum industry blossom everywhere as soon as possible.

How to accelerate the development of oil fields to increase crude oil production was the central topic of discussion at this conference. The representatives unanimously agreed that it is necessary to adopt the method of vigorously carrying out the technical revolution. While actively developing and constructing existing large oil fields, it is also necessary to vigorously organize the masses, use indigenous methods and simple methods to drill wells and extract oil on a large scale, and accelerate the development of those small oil fields with shallow oil layers and low yields. According to statistics from some of the materials reported at the meeting, the national area of such undeveloped oil fields with shallow oil layers and low yields is more than 1,020 square kilometers. Xinjiang, Qinghai, Guizhou, and the Songliao Plain in Northeast China are continuing to discover such oil-bearing areas during exploration. If the method of intensive drilling and oil extraction is adopted in these oil-bearing areas, tens of millions of tons of crude oil can be produced every year. Together with the output of large oil fields, the national production of natural petroleum can be greatly changed.

The conference determined that the future policy for oil field development is: "From small to large, from shallow to deep, combining indigenous and foreign methods, extracting every drop of petroleum resources." In terms of development methods, it is also necessary to change the past complicated and dogmatic development procedures, and adopt the "three-simultaneous policy" of simultaneous exploration, production, and construction. Only in this way can the petroleum industry be developed in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

In view of the fact that the increase in drilling and oil extraction workload will inevitably lead to difficulties such as insufficient materials, equipment, and manpower, the conference determined that it is necessary to adhere to the principle of "comprehensive utilization, diversified operations, relying on the masses, and striving for self-reliance," adapt to local conditions, use local materials, and manufacture materials and equipment by ourselves to meet needs. From now on, a vigorous technical revolution movement of "one factory with multiple capabilities, one person with multiple skills, and one machine with multiple uses" will be launched in the national natural petroleum industry system. It is also necessary to improve labor organization and train new technical forces to further overcome the above-mentioned difficulties.

Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 28th – The on-site conference held by the Ministry of Petroleum Industry in Yumen Oil Mine adopted the method of "talking inside the meeting, watching outside the meeting, combining the introduction of experience with on-site visits and learning" to exchange experiences in technical revolution.

The conference held a technical innovation exhibition, which used physical objects, models, charts, and other means to display more than 2,000 technical innovation cases created by workers and staff of the Yumen, Xinjiang, and Qinghai petroleum industries, and Dunhuang Transportation Company. The series of reforms and creations made by the workers of the Yumen Oil Mine Oil Extraction Plant in oil extraction technology attracted the attention of the representatives. The automatic wax removal winch trial-produced by apprentice Zhang Weimin can fully automate the wax removal work of oil wells, eliminating the need for wax removal vehicles and wax removal workers used in the past, and ensuring normal oil well production and increasing crude oil production. Li Guangming, the secretary of the general party branch of the Second Mine, created the use of cheaper wire ropes to replace sucker rods for oil extraction, which greatly reduced costs and solved the problem of insufficient sucker rods (made of steel) in China. Zhang Huanjun of the Second Mine made partial improvements to imported pumping units, making the "pumping stroke" twice as long as before. Recently, the oil extraction plant has promoted the results in forty oil wells. The output of most oil wells has increased by more than 50%, and some oil wells have increased by one to two times. The workers of the oil extraction plant have also created more than a dozen economical and lightweight pumping units, some of which use wind power and petroleum natural gas as power to extract oil. The person in charge of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the representatives all believe that these creations are major innovations in China's current oil extraction technology, especially for the large-scale development of shallow oil layer oil fields in the future.

The representatives also visited and studied how to speed up drilling, indigenous drilling methods, and oil extraction, etc., in the Yumen Oil Mine's Petroleum Gully, Lao Junmiao, and Yaerxia oil fields.

Regarding the experience of how to carry out the technical revolution movement, the representatives all believed that the Yumen Oil Mine has done a relatively good job in this regard. This year, the workers of the Yumen Oil Mine have set off a technical revolution climax. According to incomplete statistics from seven units in June, the workers put forward more than 27,400 technical innovation proposals, which is equal to 6.5 times the total number of rationalization proposals in the entire last year. More than 1,800 pieces have been adopted and implemented, saving a value of more than 23.4 million yuan. (Attached pictures)

The Nanchong oil area in Sichuan has recently sprayed a large amount of oil. The farmland irrigation channels in the oil area have become crude oil ditches. Three to five hundred members of agricultural production cooperatives near the oil wells are picking up buckets and pots to collect oil, and people hundreds of miles away are also rushing to collect oil after hearing the news.

    批判“一条腿走路”思想　交流技术革命经验
    加速发展石油工业
    石油工业部在玉门召开现场会议
    据新华社玉门28日电　我国石油工业决心以高速度猛追钢铁工业，并且力争在最短期间内摘掉石油工业落后的帽子。这是石油工业部7月9日到22日在玉门油矿召开的现场会议上提出的奋斗目标。
    这次会议根据全国钢铁工业和机械工业大跃进的新形势，根据天然石油勘探工作的新发展，重新规划了第二个五年计划天然石油的生产水平，并拟订了石油产量增长的指标。
    会议认为：要加快石油工业跃进的步伐，必须进一步批判过去“用一条腿走路”办石油工业的方法，大力贯彻“全党全民办石油”的方针。所谓“用一条腿走路”，就是在办石油工业当中，只注意石油工业部“独家经营”，忽视了中央与地方同时并举；只注意办大型的、现代化的、高标准的天然油矿，忽视了大中小同时并举；在技术上只注意用洋办法，忽视了土洋并举。根据这一精神，新疆、四川、玉门、青海等地区的代表，都制订了积极帮助地方发展石油工业的规划，决定以这些地区现有石油工业部门作为主力，大力培训地方石油工业力量作为“民兵”，用这种“主力加民兵”的办法，大干、多干、快干，尽速使石油工业遍地开花。
    如何加速油田的开发以增产原油，是这次会议着重讨论的中心议题。到会代表一致认为，要采用大搞技术革命的方法，在积极开发和建设现有大油田的同时，大力组织群众，运用土法和简易办法大规模地钻井、采油，加快开发那些油层浅、产量小的小油田。据会上汇报的部分材料统计，全国这种油层浅、产量小而没有开发的油田面积有一千零二十多平方公里，新疆、青海、贵州及东北的松辽平原等地区，在勘探中还在继续发现这样的含油地带。如果在这些含油面积内采用密集钻井采油的方法，每年就可以产几千万吨原油。加上大油田的产量，全国天然石油的生产就可以大大改观。
    会议确定，今后油田开发的方针是：“由小到大，由浅到深，土洋并举，挖尽每一滴石油资源。”在开发方法上，也要改变过去那种繁复的、教条主义的开发程序，采用边钻探、边生产、边建设的“三边政策”。只有这样，才能又多又快又好又省地发展石油工业。
    鉴于钻井、采油工作量增长以后，必将发生器材设备、人力不足等困难，会议确定要本着“综合利用、多种经营、依靠群众、力求自力更生”的方针，因地制宜，就地取材，自己动手制造器材设备，满足需要。从现在起，还要在全国天然石油工业系统，掀起一个声势浩大的“一厂多能、一人多艺、一机多用”的技术革命运动，还要改善劳动组织，培训新生技术力量，以进一步克服上述困难。
    据新华社玉门28日电　石油工业部在玉门油矿召开的现场会议，采用“会内谈、会外看，介绍经验与现场参观学习相结合”的办法，交流了技术革命的经验。
    会议举办了技术革新展览会，用实物、模型、图表等展出了玉门、新疆、青海石油工业的职工和敦煌运输公司创造的两千多项技术革新事例。玉门油矿采油厂职工对采油技术进行的一系列的改革和创造，引起了代表们的重视。学徒张伟民试制成功的自动化制腊绞车，可以使油井的清腊工作全部自动化，把过去清腊时需用的清腊车和清腊工全部省掉，又能保证油井正常生产，增产原油。二矿场党总支书记李光明创造的用价值较为便宜的钢丝绳代替抽油杆抽油，大大降低了成本，而且解决了我国抽油杆
  （钢制的）不足的困难。二矿场张焕君把进口抽油机作了部分改进，使“抽油冲程”比原来增大了一倍，最近经采油厂在四十口油井推广结果，大部分油井的产量增长了50％以上，部分油井增产一倍到二倍。采油厂职工还创造出十多种经济、轻便的抽油机，有的是用风力和石油天然气作动力抽油的。石油工业部负责人和代表们都认为，这些创造，是我国目前采油技术上的重大革新，尤其是对于今后大规模开发浅油层油田将起重大作用。
    代表们还去玉门油矿石油沟、老君庙、鸭儿峡等油田参观学习了如何加快钻井速度、土法钻井、采油等经验。
    关于如何开展技术革命运动的经验，代表们都认为玉门油矿在这方面是作的比较好的。玉门油矿全矿职工今年掀起了一个技术革命高潮。据七个单位6月份不完全的统计，职工们共提出技术革新建议两万七千四百多件，等于去年全年合理化建议总和的六点五倍。已经采纳实现的一千八百多件，节约价值为两千三百四十多万元。（附图片）
