    The Chinese People Will Always Support the People of the Middle East
    Adding Strength to the Defense of World Peace
    During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, we railway workers in Andong were on the front lines of national defense and personally suffered from the aggression of U.S. imperialism. We still remember the American devils' planes bombing our territory and slaughtering our peaceful people. But we were not intimidated. On the contrary, we became stronger and defeated the American aggressors. Today, U.S. and British imperialism have brazenly sent troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan, and we must not tolerate it!
    In order to support the just struggle of the people of the Middle East, 1,500 young people and all staff members and workers on the railway front in the Andong area are determined to transform their anger into strength and quickly realize the mechanization and electrification of railway transportation to better serve the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. We deeply understand that adding a brick to the construction of the motherland is adding strength to the defense of world peace. We have now formed forty-two industrial drought resistance armies, and by the 19th, we had collected more than 80 tons of scrap steel to put thirty-six factories into production as soon as possible. We will use this to strike at the U.S. and British aggressors!

  Let U.S. and British Imperialists Be Completely Crushed Under the Wheels of History
    U.S. and British imperialists have not learned from their past failures, especially the Korean War and the Suez Crisis. They vainly attempt to restore colonial rule in the Middle East. They ignore the Arab people's desire for national liberation, send troops to invade Lebanon, Jordan, and Libya, and still want to use the gunboat diplomacy that has been bankrupt for more than a hundred years to stop the progress of the wheels of history. This is just a dream.
    Imperialism has never been reconciled to its failures and has always regarded the volcano as its throne for self-admiration. I want to warn the imperialists that your guns cannot defeat the hearts of the Middle Eastern people who share the same hatred. The ragtag camp you put together cannot withstand the firm hearts of peace-loving people all over the world who fully support the people of the Middle East for justice and peace. The only way out for you is to get out of the Middle East immediately.
    These words may be wasted on you. Then, let you taste the power of peace-loving people all over the world again! Throughout human history, those who commit many injustices will perish. Not to mention the distant past, the past events of Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, etc., are your present.
    With incomparable anger, I shout: "Imperialists, get out of the Middle East!" Otherwise, let the U.S. and British imperialists be completely crushed under the wheels of history!

      We Love Peace! We Are Not Afraid of War!
    Iraq, which used to obediently implement the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression, has overnight become a republic opposing imperialism. We cheer for the birth of the Republic of Iraq.
    But the imperialists are not reconciled. U.S. imperialism landed in Lebanon, and British imperialism landed in Jordan and Libya. We solemnly warn the imperialist robbers to quickly lay down their weapons and withdraw their claws. If you dare to continue to act recklessly, you will definitely be smashed by the iron fists of peace-loving people. In 1956, British and French imperialism invaded Egypt. What was the result? The result was not that Egypt succumbed, but that imperialism suffered a crushing defeat and the British Prime Minister fell from power. Isn't this enough to learn from?
    Six hundred million Chinese people resolutely support the Arab people. Imperialists should immediately get out of Lebanon, Jordan, and Libya. The U.S. paper tiger has long been exposed on the Korean battlefield. Imperialists are, after all, a paper tiger in the face of the great Soviet Union, China, and the socialist camp, and in the face of the people of the Middle East and the world. Victory will surely belong to the people of the Middle East, and victory will surely belong to the people who love peace.

    Take Action to Support the Struggle of the Arab People!
    We were very angry when we heard the news of the armed aggression of Lebanon and Jordan by U.S. and British imperialism. We believe that this desperate action of U.S. and British imperialism is a sign of being at the end of their rope. We believe that the Arab people will surely achieve a complete victory in national independence.
    We all propose to protest against the aggression of U.S. and British imperialism and support the just struggle of the Arab people with practical actions to support industrial construction by collecting metal equipment and marching towards all-rounders. On the very night we learned of U.S. imperialism's invasion of Lebanon, we urgently mobilized and searched for scrap metal equipment everywhere in the entire factory. By twelve o'clock at night, we had collected more than 10,000 jin of various scrap metal equipment. We also discussed how to march towards all-rounders and further improve service quality. For example, the comrades in the clothing group proposed to become a fine employee who can do the work of four within a month, and everyone should become an all-rounder. All the young people expressed that they would become all-rounders before "August 1st".

### 中国人民永远支持中东人民

    中国人民永远支持中东人民
    为保卫世界和平增添一份力量
    抗美援朝时，我们安东铁路工人曾处于国防最前线，亲身受过美帝国主义的侵略。我们还记得美国鬼子的飞机曾经在我们的领土上进行轰炸，屠杀我们的和平人民。可是我们并没有被吓倒。相反，更加坚强了，我们打垮了美国侵略者。今天美英帝国主义又悍然出兵侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，我们决不能容忍！
    为了支援中东人民的正义斗争，我们安东地区铁路战线上的一千五百名青年和全体职工，坚决化愤怒为力量，迅速实现铁路运输的机械化和电气化，更好地为工农业生产大跃进服务。我们深深地懂得，为祖国的建设加一块砖，就是为保卫世界的和平增添一份力量。现在我们已经组成了四十二个工业抗旱大军，到19日止，共搜集了八十多吨旧废钢铁，尽速使三十六个工厂早日投入生产。我们以此来打击美英侵略者！
                    安东地区铁路二十五名青年先进生产者
  让美英帝国主义者在历史的车轮下彻底粉碎
    美英帝国主义者，没有从他们的历次失败中，特别是侵朝战争和侵埃战争中取得教训，他们妄想恢复在中东的殖民地统治。他们无视阿拉伯人民民族解放的愿望，派兵侵入黎巴嫩、约旦和利比亚，还想用一百多年来早已破产了的炮舰外交，来阻挡历史车轮的前进，这不过是一个梦想罢了。
    帝国主义向来是不甘心于他们的失败的，向来是把火山口当作他们自我欣赏的宝座。我这里要警告帝国主义者，你们的枪炮敌不过中东人民敌忾同仇的心。你们拼凑起来的乌合阵营，敌不住全世界爱好和平者为了正义，为了和平，全力支援中东人民的坚定的心。只有立即滚出中东，才是你们唯一的出路。
    这些话，可能对你们是白说。那么，就让你们再一次尝尝全世界爱好和平人民的力量吧！在全部人类历史上，多行不义，必自毙。远的不说，希特勒、墨索里尼、东条等的前事，就是你们的今天。
    我以无比的愤怒高呼：“帝国主义者滚出中东去！”不然的话，让美英帝国主义者，在历史的车轮下彻底粉碎吧！
                                    中国科学院　杨锺健
      我们热爱和平！我们不怕战争！
    伊拉克这个过去俯首贴耳地执行美帝国主义侵略政策的工具，一夜之间，成为反对帝国主义的共和国，我们为伊拉克共和国的诞生而欢呼。
    可是帝国主义者并不甘心，美帝在黎巴嫩登了陆，英帝在约旦和利比亚登了陆。我们严正地警告帝国主义强盗，赶快放下武器，缩回魔爪，你们如果胆敢继续胡作非为，就一定要被爱好和平的铁拳砸得粉碎。1956年英法帝国主义曾经侵略过埃及，结果是怎样呢？结果不是埃及屈服，而是帝国主义惨败了，英国首相倒台了，这还不足引以为训吗？
    六亿中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯人民，帝国主义者应立即从黎巴嫩、约旦和利比亚滚出去。美帝这只纸老虎，早已在朝鲜战场上被戳穿了。帝国主义者在伟大的苏联、中国和社会主义阵营面前，在中东和全世界人民面前，毕竟是只纸老虎。胜利一定属于中东人民，胜利一定属于爱好和平的人民。

    行动起来，支援阿拉伯人民的斗争！
    当我们听到美英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的消息后，感到非常愤怒。我们认为，美英帝国主义这种狗急跳墙的行动，正是穷途末路的表现。我们相信，阿拉伯人民一定会取得民族独立的彻底胜利。
    我们大家提出：以搜集金属器材支援工业建设和向多面手进军的实际行动，来抗议美英帝国主义的侵略行为，支援阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。就在我们知道美帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩的当天晚上，大家紧急动员起来，在全场各个角落，到处搜寻废旧金属器材。到夜里十二点，已搜集到各种废旧金属器材一万斤以上。我们又讨论了如何向多面手进军，进一步提高服务质量的问题。如服装组的同志们提出，要在一个月内，做到精一员兼四员，人人成为多面手。全体青年表示要在“八一”以前，人人成为多面手。
