    Medicinal Plants
    Like the Chinese people, the Bulgarian people have used a wide variety of wild plants as medicinal materials for treating diseases since ancient times. In the mountains, fields, and forests of Bulgaria, there grow more than 500 kinds of wild plants that can be used as medicinal materials, such as the beautiful chamomile, dog rose, and poppy. Not long ago, China's specialty, ginseng, also took root in Bulgarian soil and is growing quite well.

    Bulgaria attaches great importance to the research of medicinal plants. Institutions such as the Institute of Medicinal Materials Science, the Institute of Plant Cultivation, and the Institute of Botany of the Academy of Sciences are all engaged in the research and processing of medicinal materials. The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences has also established two experimental stations specifically to formulate measures for planting medicinal plants. The Central Cooperative Union also holds training courses every year to train personnel in collecting medicinal material raw materials. In addition, many agricultural cooperatives are also planting medicinal plants in large quantities, such as black mustard, datura, valerian, peppermint, and lavender. Bulgaria's pharmaceutical industry processes more than 50 tons of such medicinal materials every year.

    In Bulgaria, in addition to general pharmacies, there are also specialized medicinal plant stores that sell more than 150 kinds of herbs.

    Many countries, such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, are in great need of Bulgaria's wild plant medicinal materials. In 1957, Bulgaria exported 2,500 tons of medicinal plants. (Attached picture)

    药用植物
    保加利亚人民同我国人民一样，从古时候就利用各种各样的野生植物作药材治病。在保加利亚的山岭、田野和森林里，生长着美丽的洋甘菊、犬蔷薇、罂粟等五百多种可作药材的野生植物。不久以前，我国的特产人参也在保加利亚土地上扎下了根，而且长得还不错。
    保加利亚很重视药用植物的研究工作，像药材科学研究所、植物栽培研究所和科学院植物研究所都在进行对药材的研究和加工工作。保加利亚科学院还建立了两个试验站，专门制定栽种药用植物的措施，中央合作联社每年也举办训练班，训练收摘药材原料的人员。此外，许多农业合作社也在大量栽种像黑芥、曼陀罗、缬草、洋薄荷和熏衣草等药用植物。保加利亚的制药工业每年加工这样的药材五十多吨。
    在保加利亚，除去一般的药房外，还有专门的药用植物商店，出售一百五十多种药草。
    许多国家，像匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞士、英国等，都很需要保加利亚的野生植物药材，1957年保加利亚就输出了二千五百吨药用植物。（附图片）
