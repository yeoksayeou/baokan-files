Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th. According to the Korean Central News Agency: In order to ensure that agricultural mechanization keeps pace with agricultural cooperativization, North Korea is launching a mass movement to improve and invent agricultural machinery. At a recent national conference in Pyongyang to evaluate newly invented agricultural machinery, one hundred and forty new types of agricultural machines were exhibited, three times more than at last year's conference.

Many of these machines are easy to use, easy to manufacture, and can be quickly promoted. Among them are machines that can be used effectively with slight improvements, such as animal-drawn rice harvesters, potato harvesters, and rice transplanters. With the help of scientific workers, these complex agricultural machines will soon be fully manufactured.

While helping farmer-inventors, North Korean scientific workers are working hard to complete their own inventions. Agricultural machinery experts from agricultural science research institutions are trial-producing more than thirty new types of agricultural machinery.

During the post-war period, many machines created by North Korean scientific workers and farmer-inventors have been mass-produced and are serving the cause of agricultural mechanization.

This year, 5,300 new plows, 9,300 animal-drawn weeders, 7,000 mechanized threshing machines, 5,000 corn threshing machines, and other advanced agricultural machines, as well as a large number of small farm tools, will be supplied to rural areas. In addition, to mechanize transportation, a large number of pedal carts, handcarts, and other tools will be supplied. By the end of this year, one thousand large agricultural cooperatives will be using trucks to transport goods.

At the same time, agricultural machinery stations are strengthening their assistance to agricultural cooperatives in achieving mechanization every year. By the end of the Five-Year Plan (1961), the workload of agricultural machinery stations will increase by 3.3 times compared to 1956. Their number of tractors will also increase by 1.8 times.

    使用方便　容易制造　便于推广
    朝鲜制成多种新式农业机器
    新华社平壤6日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜为了使农业机械化能够跟上农业合作化，正在展开一个改进和发明农业机器的群众运动。最近在平壤举行的一个评定新发明的农业机器的全国性会议上，展出了一百四十种新式农业机器，比去年会议上展出的增加了三倍。
    这些机器很多都是使用方便，很容易制造并且能够迅速推广的。其中也有一些像用牲畜拉的稻谷收割机、马铃薯收割机和插秧机等只要稍加改进就可以有效地使用的机器。在科学工作者的帮助下，这些复杂的农业机器不久就可以完全制造成功。
    朝鲜的科学工作者在帮助农民发明家的同时，正在努力完成他们自己的发明。农业科学研究机关的农业机械专家们正在试制三十多种新式农业机器。
    在战后时期中，朝鲜的科学工作者和农民发明家们所创造的许多机器都已经大量生产，并且在为农业机械化的事业服务。
    今年将有五千三百架新式犁、九千三百架牲畜拉的除草机、七千架机械化的打谷机、五千架打玉米机和其它先进农业机器，以及大批小型农具供应各地农村。此外，为了使运输机械化，还将供应大批脚踏货车、手推车和其它工具。今年年底有一千个大农业合作社将要用卡车来运货。
    同时，农业机器站每年都在加强帮助各农业社实现机械化的工作。到五年计划结束时（1961年），农业机器站的工作量将比1956年增加三点三倍。它们的拖拉机数量也将增加一点八倍。
