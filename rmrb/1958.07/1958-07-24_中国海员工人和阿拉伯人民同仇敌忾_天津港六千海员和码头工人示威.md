Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 22nd: More than six thousand seamen and dockworkers in Tianjin Port, which had once suffered from the armed aggression of British imperialism, are angrily denouncing the crimes of US-British imperialism in their armed aggression against the Middle East.

In Xin'gang, the international port of peace and trade where four or five ten-thousand-ton freighters dock every day, one can feel the atmosphere of Chinese maritime workers and the Arab people sharing a common hatred. Slogans such as "Chop off the claws of imperialism!" and "Support the just struggle of the Arab people!" are posted in the office halls of the port authority and on the walls of the newly built workers' residences. The dock's broadcasting station constantly broadcasts new information about the situation in the Middle East amidst the roar of cranes and electric vehicle motors. On the afternoon of July 18th, when news of the British army's invasion of Jordan arrived, more than 1,200 employees working at the Xin'gang wharf immediately held a demonstration. The demonstration procession circled the wharf, shouting: "US aggressors get out of Lebanon!" "British aggressors get out of Jordan!" Sailors from ships of the German Democratic Republic and Norway, docked at the wharf, also stood on the deck, waving their hats and applauding the demonstrating crowd.

After the demonstration, the workers at this port could not calm their anger at the aggression of US-British imperialism. Qian Chun, an old worker who has been working at the dock since he was sixteen years old and the leader of the tool repair team, said: "I have personally tasted the aggression of US-British imperialism. We will never live that life again. We cannot stand idly by while US-British imperialism aggresses against the Arab people." Engineer Hou Zhao said: "Now is not the era of a hundred years ago. The Chinese people, who have taken their destiny into their own hands, have turned the imperialist port into a peaceful commercial port. We will never allow US-British imperialism to aggress against the Arab people." In their indignation, the employees are working even harder to strengthen the country's strength to defend peace. Today, the loading efficiency of "Peace No. 2" has exceeded the quota by one and a half times. The loading efficiency of the "Zhongxing No. 6" barge also exceeded the quota by one time the day before yesterday.

    中国海员工人和阿拉伯人民同仇敌忾
    天津港六千海员和码头工人示威
    新华社天津22日电　曾经遭受英帝国主义武装侵略的天津港的六千多名海员和码头工人，愤怒地声讨美英帝国主义武装侵略中东的罪行。
    在每天停靠着四、五艘万吨巨轮的国际和平贸易港口——新港，到处可以感到中国海员工人和阿拉伯人民同仇敌忾的气氛。“斩断帝国主义的魔爪！”“支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争！”等标语，张贴在港务局的办公大厅和新建的工人住宅的墙壁上。码头的广播站在起重机、电动车马达的轰鸣声中，不断广播有关中东局势的新消息。18日下午，当英国军队侵入约旦的消息传来以后，正在新港码头工作的一千二百多名职工，立即进行了示威游行，游行队伍绕着码头高呼：“美国侵略军从黎巴嫩滚出去！”“英国侵略军从约旦滚出去！”停靠在码头上的德意志民主共和国和挪威等国轮船的海员们，也站在甲板上向游行队伍挥帽、鼓掌致意。
    这个港口的工人在游行示威以后，对美英帝国主义侵略罪行的激愤心情不能平息，从十六岁起就在码头上做工的老工人、工具修理组长钱春说：“美英帝国主义的侵略滋味，我都亲自尝过，我们永远不会再过这个日子，对美英帝国主义侵略阿拉伯人民，不能袖手旁观。”工程师侯钊说：“现在已经不是一百年前的时代了，自己掌握了命运的中国人，已把帝国主义口岸变成和平商港，我们决不容许美英帝国主义侵略阿拉伯人民。”职工们在激愤情绪中，以更加紧张的劳动，来加强祖国保卫和平的力量，今天“和平二号”的装船效率已经超过定额一倍半。前天“中兴六号”驳轮的装船效率也超过定额一倍。
