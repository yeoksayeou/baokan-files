Simultaneous Development of Industry and Agriculture and Simultaneous Development of Large, Medium, and Small Enterprises

    We can understand the correctness of the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture from our practical work. The two agricultural upsurges in 1955 and 1958 greatly promoted the arrival of industrial upsurges, and industrial development has powerfully supported and guaranteed the continued high growth of agriculture. Some comrades still have unclear ideas about this dialectical relationship between developing industry and developing agriculture. They oppose the two, either grasping agriculture and losing industry, or developing industry without serving agriculture.

    Facts prove that developing local industry not only does not hinder agriculture, but also powerfully promotes the development of agriculture. Grasping agriculture is to achieve "four, five, eight," and grasping local industry is also to achieve "four, five, eight," all for the purpose of building socialism. At present, the rural areas are generally faced with problems such as backward tools, lack of fertilizer, and insufficient labor, which seriously affect the great leap forward in agricultural production. To solve these problems, in addition to relying on the efforts of agriculture itself, we must also rely on the support of industry. Now it seems that wherever industry is developed quickly and in large quantities, the problems in agricultural production are solved quickly and well. Countless examples prove that developing local industry, especially county, township, and commune industry, is not only a requirement for developing industry, but also, first and foremost, a requirement for developing agriculture.

    Perhaps some people will ask: Is the relationship between mining and agriculture not very close? Actually, it is not the case. Mineral products are very closely related to agriculture. According to the statistics of the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, the proportion of mineral products supplied to rural areas is: pig iron accounts for more than 12%, coal accounts for more than 50%, and kerosene accounts for more than 80%. There is no doubt that with the rapid development of agricultural production and agricultural technology in our country, the demand for mineral products such as steel, coal, and petroleum in rural areas will inevitably increase. The surge in the demand for pig iron and steel during the current great leap forward in agriculture due to the large-scale manufacture of new farm tools and improved farm tools is a clear proof. From this, it can also be seen that the view that mining is unrelated to agriculture is incorrect, and the non-positive attitude towards mining must be corrected.

    The current agricultural production tasks are very heavy, and drought resistance, wheat harvesting, summer planting, flood prevention, and waterlogging prevention are all very tense. Can we free up our hands to grasp industry when the farming season is slack? We say that the busier the farming season, the more we need to grasp industry. The busier the farming season, the more we need farm tools, water lifting tools, transportation tools, and fertilizers. It is precisely at this time that rapidly establishing industry can solve some of the problems that arise during the busy farming season in a timely manner, and better exert the role of industry in supporting agriculture, saving labor, improving work efficiency, and greatly helping agriculture. Because agricultural production in the future will no longer have the kind of slack farming season it had in the past, waiting for the slack farming season to grasp industry is, in fact, equivalent to not grasping industry.

    Some comrades still have some doubts about the simultaneous development of large, medium, and small enterprises. First of all, there is the issue of the view on large and small. Of course, we cannot ignore the important significance of developing large enterprises, which are the backbone of industry and the foundation for establishing an industrial system. Counties and above, especially provinces, must establish some large and medium-sized enterprises. As for counties and below, small-scale enterprises should be the main focus, first popularizing and then improving. However, some comrades look down on small enterprises, thinking that small enterprises cannot solve big problems, but small enterprises are easy to establish, especially easy to establish in large quantities, so the entire perspective is that small enterprises can also solve big problems.

    Secondly, there is the issue of the relationship between "native" and "foreign." Why should we focus on native methods rather than foreign methods at present? This reason is also simple and clear. Due to the current lack of equipment and materials, insufficient funds, and lack of technology, adopting "foreign methods" and pursuing modernization and mechanization on a large scale will inevitably encounter many difficulties that are currently difficult to solve, which will inevitably delay the speed of our country's socialist construction. On the contrary, if we widely adopt native methods and build small enterprises while adopting new technologies and building large enterprises, we can avoid many difficulties in construction and rapidly establish industrial enterprises to solve current needs. In May, more than 1,300 factories and mines built with native methods in our province were put into production every day, which fully illustrates this point. Of course, native methods are not our goal. Our goal is to achieve modernization and mechanization. However, our current approach is to put native methods into operation first, and then gradually mechanize or semi-mechanize. The experience of seven cooperatives in Weifang City introduced at this conference in achieving mechanized production fully demonstrates that native methods of production can fully develop into mechanization. It is not difficult to see that correctly implementing the above-mentioned policies can achieve the goal of more, faster, better, and more economical results.

    Take Steel as the Key Link to Promote the Development of the
        Machine Industry and Other Industries

    The lack of machinery and equipment is the most prominent problem in the current industrial construction. To develop the machine industry, we must have steel, and to produce iron and steel, we must develop the coking industry and the coal industry. Steel and coal are the food of industry. Without steel and coal, the great development of other industries, and even the great development of agriculture, will be affected. Therefore, vigorously developing the steel industry and taking steel as the key link can meet and promote the great development of the machine industry, and at the same time drive the universal development of other industries. Developing the steel industry not only has the urgent significance at present, but also must see its entire great significance, which is to provide guaranteed conditions for the continuous leap forward of our province's industry and to lay the foundation for national industrialization and agricultural modernization. It can be predicted that the demand for steel next year will be even greater. Therefore, this year we must not only solve the current problems, but also make certain reserves for next year and lay the foundation for a greater leap forward in the steel industry. Our province has relatively abundant iron ore and coal resources, and the machine, coal and other industries have a certain foundation. Compared with some provinces, we have more favorable conditions for developing the steel industry. We must not only rely on the central government and other provinces to solve the difficulty of steel shortage, on the contrary, we must vigorously develop the steel industry and support other provinces as much as possible. Therefore, there is only one way out, which is to actively develop the steel industry by relying on our own efforts.

    Our province's plans for steel and coal in 1958 were relatively conservative and far from actual needs. We must take a big step forward in steel production on the existing basis. Some comrades think that it is almost enough in 1958, and we should make a leap forward in 1959! This view is wrong. If we cannot make steel production jump forward in 1958, it will be difficult to have a greater leap forward in 1959. In order to complete the tasks for 1958, we must have a blitz in July and August to achieve a necessary scale of development.

    (1) According to this requirement, in order to solve the difficulty of steel shortage, especially from a long-term perspective, establishing some large and medium-sized enterprises is not only completely necessary, but also must be developed more actively and cannot be relaxed in the slightest. Our province is also grasping this tightly, and enterprises of the scale of Jinan Iron and Steel Plant will not be built only one, but two or three, in order to lay the foundation for our province's industry. However, in order to solve practical problems and meet production needs as soon as possible, we should still focus on small-scale native methods and engage in them on a large scale. We must work hard in July to establish them quickly and improve them gradually. Therefore, our original plan to develop 680 small blast furnaces is not enough, and we must greatly develop them and strive for 1,000 and strive to get them up and running by the end of August. Bessemer converters can be built and put into production in less than a month, so we must engage in them on a large scale; blast furnaces of 13, 28, and 55 cubic meters should also be put into production ahead of schedule, and no later than National Day. Crucible and pig snout furnaces should be universally developed in areas with iron ore, the more the better, the faster the better, and strive to establish them universally in July.

    (2) In order to ensure the leap forward of the steel industry, we must vigorously strengthen the mining of iron ore. All counties with conditions should strive to overfulfill the ore mining plan. Of course, to achieve, especially to exceed, the newly revised planned figures, we must make great efforts. In areas with iron ore, we must quickly establish mining groups in agricultural cooperatives, establish brigades in townships, and establish companies in counties. The county party committee must make plans for the required labor force and make unified arrangements. We must vigorously rely on the masses to report and mine ores. The experience of Quanmin Mining in Jiaonan County is good. They "explore while mining," mining one jin when they have one jin, and mining one ton when they have one ton. If they don't have it, they look for another one. I hope everyone will seriously learn from their experience. While vigorously mining iron ore and coal mines, we should also actively mine other non-ferrous metals and non-metallic mines.

    (3) In order to ensure that the needs of steel for coke are met, we must vigorously develop the coking and coal industries. For this reason, the planned output of coal must also make another leap forward. All coal mine units should learn from Xinwen Coal Mine and learn from their spirit of leap forward. In terms of methods, we should promote using large to bring small, opening more small coal kilns, and using more native methods for coking, while paying attention to strengthening comprehensive recycling to avoid waste of resources.

    (4) Refractory materials, steelmaking equipment such as blowers, and mining equipment should also increase production accordingly to meet the needs of developing the steel and coal industries.

    (5) In order to ensure the great leap forward in the steel and coal industries, all localities (the relevant prefectural and county party committees) should immediately establish leading groups and offices, transfer capable cadres, go deep into the front lines in a timely manner, supervise and inspect, summarize and exchange experiences, so as to promote the development of overall work in a timely manner.
      Continue to Vigorously Develop Township and Commune Industries

    In July, we should make a comprehensive blitz to develop township and commune industries and strive to build 500,000 factories, mines, and groups this year. In order to achieve this requirement, each agricultural cooperative must establish approximately ten units. Generally, we should first establish the two industries (iron industry, wood industry), the two materials (fertilizer, feed), and the three processing industries (grain processing, edible oil processing, clothing processing). Where there are minerals, marine products, and agricultural and sideline products that need to be processed, we must quickly establish industries in these areas based on specific conditions. The development of township and commune industries should also adopt the practice of blitz establishment and gradual improvement. We should work hard for ten days or half a month to establish what can be established in the shortest possible time. After township and commune industries are established, we must immediately start studying the issue of consolidation and improvement (the consolidation of established factories, mines, and groups is even more important), among which two issues particularly need attention. One is the issue of how to organize production. Generally, after township and commune industries are established, we should immediately launch a technical innovation campaign to improve production tools and operating methods, and vigorously innovate agricultural tools to improve agricultural labor productivity. At the same time, we must focus on technical innovation, grasp planning, grasp management, and grasp leadership. The plans for township and commune industries should not be complicated. At the beginning, only three indicators are needed: product output, quality, and cost. They can be gradually increased later. Another issue is the arrangement of labor force in township-run industries. The arrangement of labor force must be subordinate to agricultural production, and also take into account industrial production. The wages of workers can be slightly higher than the average income of farmers, but should not be too disparate. The determination of wages can be based on the following principles: conducive to developing the enthusiasm of industry, conducive to accumulation, and conducive to worker-peasant relations.
      Rely on the Masses and Rely on Our Own Efforts

    In the process of the great leap forward in industrial production, we have encountered some difficulties, such as tight raw materials, difficulties in technical equipment, lack of technical forces, and insufficient funds. However, these difficulties have not stopped our heroic steps. Some difficulties have been solved by us, such as the problem of industrial funds, which is no longer a difficult problem. Some difficulties are being gradually overcome. For example, the shortage of steel, we immediately started to develop the steel industry, mobilized the masses to carry out the movement to collect scrap steel, clear inventories, and save steel to meet the great leap forward of the machine industry and various industries.

    On the road to the great leap forward, we will definitely encounter some difficulties. We have encountered them in the past, and we will encounter them in the future. Experience tells us that these difficulties can be overcome. The key lies in what attitude we take towards these difficulties and what methods we use to overcome these difficulties. The correct attitude should be: to despise any difficulty first, then attach importance to it, rely on the masses and rely on our own efforts, do everything possible, overcome difficulties, and not simply rely on higher-level departments and fraternal regions. Facts have proved that as long as we believe in and rely on the masses, break superstitions, liberate our minds, make the masses dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and then present the difficult problems to the masses, organize them to speak out and debate, pool their ideas and efforts, and offer suggestions, the difficulties will be solved. Don't all localities regard steelmaking as very mysterious? However, Jinan Shengjian Machinery Factory used its practical actions to answer: "With a converter, steel can be blown at once" "Steelmaking is easy, making furnaces is not difficult." This factory is very small in scale and its equipment is not good. There are many factories in various places with the same or even better conditions than it. Why can it make Bessemer converters for steelmaking by itself, and we can't? This is entirely possible.
    Strengthen the Party Committee's Leadership over Industrial Production

    The development of the situation requires the Party organizations at the prefectural, county, township, and commune levels to not only learn to lead agricultural production, but also to learn to lead industrial production, and not only to learn to run communes, but also to learn to run factories. The task of the Party Committee's leadership is, first of all, to make unified arrangements for rectification, industrial and agricultural production, and other work. We must take rectification as the commander, production as the center, organize the forces of various departments, twist them into a rope, use rectification to promote production, and make industrial and agricultural production support each other, complement each other, and leap forward together. Party committees at all levels should adopt the method of using the abstract to lead the concrete in leading industrial production, attach importance to political and ideological work, and resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction. The main ideological problems to be solved at present are: insufficient understanding of the important significance of developing county, township, and commune industries, especially the steel industry; the mysterious view of industry has not been completely broken; not interested in the method of focusing on small-scale enterprises and putting native methods into operation first; the spirit of self-reliance and overcoming difficulties has not been fully developed, etc. These must be carefully resolved through rectification and in practical work, in order to correctly implement the "four fors," "three on-sites," "two mainlys," and "one self-reliance" policies and principles proposed by the Central Committee. At the same time, it is necessary to repeatedly emphasize the establishment of communist style, liberate the mind, break superstitions, promote the creativity of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and carry out the technical innovation movement universally and in depth.

    Secondly, we cannot regard leading industrial production as the business of a few comrades in charge, but should be the whole Party running industry. The Party Committee must conduct serious discussions on major issues in industrial production and conduct regular inspections. The first secretary of the city party committee should put the main force on industrial production. The first secretary of the prefectural and county party committees and the secretary of the township party committee should truly do one thing for agriculture and one for industry. The first secretaries of the prefectural and county party committees in areas with iron and coal must also personally grasp steel and coal and coke.

    全党动员加速工业建设
    中共山东省委第一书记舒同在省委工业会议上的总结发言（摘要）
    工农业同时并举和大中小型企业同时并举
    我们从实际工作中可以体会到工农业并举的方针的正确性，1955年和1958年的农业两次高潮都大大推动了工业高潮的到来，而工业发展又有力地支援和保证了农业的继续高涨。对于发展工业和发展农业的这种辩证关系，有些同志在观念上还弄不清楚，他们把两者对立起来，不是抓了农业丢了工业，就是发展工业不为农业服务。
    事实证明：发展地方工业不仅不妨碍农业，而且能够有力地推动农业的发展，抓农业是为了实现“四、五、八”，抓地方工业也是为了实现“四、五、八”，都是为了建设社会主义。当前农村中普遍存在着工具落后、肥料缺乏、劳力不足等问题，这些问题严重地影响着农业生产的大跃进。解决这些问题除了依靠农业本身的努力外，还必须依靠工业的支援。现在看，哪里的工业办的快，办的多，哪里农业生产中的问题就解决的快，解决的好。无数的事例都证明：发展地方工业，特别是县乡社工业，不仅是发展工业的要求，而且首先是发展农业的要求。
    也许有人会问：开矿和农业的关系不大吧？其实不然。矿产品和农业有着极为密切的关系。据第一个五年计划执行的情况统计，矿产品供应农村的比重是：生铁占12％以上，煤占50％以上，煤油占80％以上。毫无疑问，随着我国农业生产和农业技术的飞跃发展，农村对钢铁、煤炭、石油等矿产品的需要量必然会越来越多。当前农业大跃进中，因大量制造新式农具和改进农具，农村对生铁和钢材的需要量骤增，就是一个明证。从这里也可以看出，认为开矿和农业无关的看法是不正确的，对开矿采取的不积极的态度是必须加以纠正的。
    当前农业生产任务很重，抗旱、麦收、夏种、防汛、防涝都很紧张，可不可以到农闲的时候再腾出手来抓工业呢？我们说，越是农忙的时候，越需要抓工业。越是农忙就越需要抓农具，需要提水工具，需要运输工具，需要肥料，正是在这个时候，迅速地把工业建立起来，才能够适时地解决农忙中出现的一些问题，才能更好地发挥工业支援农业的作用，节约劳力提高工效，替农业大大帮忙。因为今后农业生产将不再会有像过去的那种农闲季节，等农闲再抓工业，事实上等于不抓工业。
    对于大中小型企业同时并举，有些同志还存在着一些怀疑。首先是对大和小的看法问题。当然不能忽视发展大型企业的重要意义，这是工业的骨干和建立工业体系的基础。县以上，特别是省必须建立一些大中型的企业，至于县以下则应以小型为主，先普及后提高。但有些同志却偏偏瞧不起小企业，认为小企业不能解决大问题，但是小企业易于兴办，尤其是易于大量兴办，因而整个看来，小企业同样可以解决大问题。
    其次是“土”和“洋”的关系问题。为什么当前要以土法为主，而不以洋法为主？这个道理也是简单而明了的。由于目前设备材料缺乏、资金不足、技术缺乏，大量采用“洋法”、追求现代化和机械化，必然会遇到许多目前难以解决的困难，其结果必将推迟我国社会主义建设的速度。相反的，如果在采用新技术，建设大型企业的同时，广泛地采用土法，建设小型企业，就能够避免许多建设中的困难，而把工业企业迅速地建立起来，解决当前的需要。5月份我省每天都有一千三百多个用土法建立的厂矿投入生产，就可以充分地说明这一点。当然土法不是我们的目的，我们的目的是实现现代化和机械化。但是我们当前的做法是土法先上马，然后逐步机械化或半机械化。这次会议上介绍的潍坊市七个合作社实现机械化生产的经验，充分说明土法生产是完全能够发展到机械化的。这就不难看到，正确地执行上述方针，就可以达到多快好省的目的。
    以钢为纲，促进机械工业和
        其他工业普遍发展
    机械设备缺乏是当前工业建设中的一个最为突出的问题。要发展机械工业就必须要有钢铁，而炼铁、炼钢又必须发展炼焦工业和煤炭工业。钢铁、煤炭是工业的粮食，缺乏钢铁、煤炭，其他工业的大发展，甚至农业的大发展都将受到影响。因此，大力发展钢铁工业，以钢为纲，才能够满足并促使机械工业的大发展，同时带动其他工业的普遍发展。发展钢铁工业不仅在当前有燃眉之急的意义，而且要看到它的整个重大意义，这就是要为我省工业不断的跃进提供保证条件，为国家工业化和农业现代化奠定基础。可以预料明年钢铁的需要量将会更大，因此今年不仅要解决当年的问题，而且要为明年做好一定的储备，要为钢铁工业的更大跃进打下基础。我省铁矿、煤矿的资源比较丰富，机械、煤炭等工业又有一定的基础，比起有些省来说，我们具有发展钢铁工业的更多的有利条件。我们不仅不能依赖中央和外省来解决钢铁不足的困难，相反的，我们要大力发展钢铁工业，尽可能的还要支援外省。因此，出路只有一条，这就是用自力更生的办法积极发展钢铁工业。
    我省1958年钢铁、煤炭的规划都是比较保守的，距实际需要相差很远，我们必须在现有的基础上使钢铁的产量再大大向前跃进一步。有的同志认为1958年差不多了，1959年再跃进吧！这种看法是不对的，如果1958年不能使钢铁生产跃进一步，1959年就很难有更大的跃进。为了完成1958年的任务，7、8月份必须要来一个突击，求得有一个必要规模的发展。
    （1）根据这一要求，为了解决钢铁缺乏的困难，特别是从长远着眼，建立一些大型、中型的企业，不仅是完全必要的，而且必须更积极地发展，丝毫不能放松。我省目前也正在抓紧进行，像济南钢铁厂那样规模的企业，将不是只建一个，而是二个、三个，以便为我省工业打下基础。但是为了解决现实问题，尽快地满足生产需要，当前还是应当从小型土法着眼，大搞特搞，要在7月份大干一番，突击建立，逐步提高。因此，我们原计划发展六百八十个小高炉是不够的，还要大大发展，向一千个奋斗，并争取在8月底搞起来。贝氏转炉炼钢不用一个月就可以建成投入生产，要大搞；十三、二十八、五十五立方公尺的高炉也应当提前投入生产，最晚不得拖过国庆节。坩埚、猪嘴炉在有铁矿的地区更要普遍发展，越多越好，越快越好，争取在7月份普遍建立起来。
    （2）为了保证钢铁工业的跃进，必须大力加强铁矿石的开采工作。凡有条件的县，都应力争超额完成矿石开采计划。当然，要达到特别是超过新订计划数字必须做巨大的努力。有铁矿的地区，要迅速在农业社建立采矿组，在乡成立大队，在县成立公司。对于所需劳动力问题，县委要作出计划统一安排。要大力依靠群众报矿、采矿。胶南县全民采矿的经验是好的，他们“边探边开”，有一斤开一斤，有一吨开一吨，没有了再另找。希望大家认真学习他们的经验。在大力开采铁矿、煤矿的同时，还应对其它有色金属、非金属矿积极开采。
    （3）为了保证满足钢铁用焦的需要，必须大力发展炼焦和煤炭工业。为此煤的计划产量，也必须再来一个跃进，所有煤矿单位都应向新汶煤矿看齐，学习他们的跃进精神。在方法上我们要提倡以大带小、多开小煤窑和多用土法炼焦，同时注意加强综合回收，避免资源的浪费。
    （4）耐火材料和鼓风机等炼钢设备以及采矿设备都要相应地增加生产，以满足发展钢铁、煤炭工业的需要。
    （5）为了确保钢铁煤炭工业的大跃进，各地（有关的地、县委）应立即成立领导小组和办公室，抽调得力干部，及时深入现场，督促检查，总结交流经验，以便及时地推动全面工作的开展。
      继续大力发展乡社工业
    7月份应全面突击发展乡社工业，为今年建起五十万个厂、矿、组而奋斗。为了实现这一要求，每个农业社都必须建立大约十个单位。一般应该首先把两业（铁业、木业）、两料（肥料、饲料）、三加工（粮食加工、食用油加工、服装加工）建立起来。有矿产、海产和农副产品需要加工的，要从具体条件出发，把这方面的工业迅速建立起来。发展乡社工业也要采取突击建立、逐步提高的做法，要大干十天、半月，把能够建立的在最短时间内建立起来。乡社工业建立起来以后，就要立即着手研究巩固提高的问题（已建立的厂、矿、组的巩固工作，更加重要），其中特别需要注意两个问题。一个是如何组织生产的问题。一般应该在乡社工业建立起来以后，立即开展技术革新运动，改进生产工具和操作方法，还要大力革新农具，提高农业劳动生产效率。同时要以技术革新为中心，抓计划，抓管理，抓领导。乡社工业的计划不要繁杂，开始时只要有产品产量、质量、成本等三个指标就够了，以后可以逐步增多。另一个问题是乡办工业劳动力的安排问题。劳动力的安排要服从于农业生产，同时也要照顾到工业生产。工人的工资可略高于农民的平均收入，而不要过分悬殊。工资的确定可根据以下原则：有利于发展工业的积极性，有利于积累，有利于工农关系。
      依靠群众，自力更生
    在工业生产大跃进的过程中，我们已经遇到了一些困难，如原材料紧张，技术设备困难，技术力量缺乏，资金不足等，但是这些困难，没有阻挡住我们豪迈的步伐。有些困难已经被我们解决了，如工业资金问题，就已经不是什么困难问题了。有些困难正在逐步地被克服着，如钢铁不足，我们就立即动手发展钢铁工业，发动群众开展搜集废钢铁运动，清理库存，节约钢材，满足机械工业与各种工业的大跃进。
    在大跃进的道路上，是一定会遇到一些困难的，不仅过去遇到过，今后还会遇到。经验告诉我们，这些困难都是可以克服的，关键在于用什么态度对待这些困难，用什么办法来克服这些困难。正确的态度应该是：对任何困难都是首先蔑视它，然后重视它，依靠群众自力更生，千方百计，克服困难，不单纯去依赖上级部门和兄弟地区。事实证明，只要相信和依靠群众，破除迷信，解放思想，使群众敢想、敢说、敢做，再把困难问题向群众摆开，组织他们鸣放辩论，群策群力，献策献计，困难就会得到解决。各地不是把炼钢看得很神秘吗？可是济南市生建机械厂用它的实际行动回答说：“有了转炉，就可一吹成钢”“炼钢很易，造炉不难。”这个厂的规模很小，设备也不好，和它条件相同甚至比它条件优越的，各地都大有厂在，为什么它能自造贝氏转炉炼钢，我们不能呢？这是完全能够的。
    加强党委对工业生产的领导
    形势的发展，要求地、县、乡、社党的组织，不仅要学会领导农业生产，而且要学会领导工业生产，不仅要学会办社，而且要学会办厂。党委的领导任务，首先就是把整风、工农业生产等工作做统一安排。必须以整风为统帅，生产为中心，把各部门的力量组织起来，拧成一股绳，以整风推动生产，使工农业生产互相支援，相辅相成，共同跃进。各级党委领导工业生产，应当采取以虚带实的方法，重视政治思想工作，坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线。当前要解决的思想问题主要是：对发展县、乡、社工业特别是钢铁工业的重要意义认识不足；对工业的神秘观点还没有完全打破；对小型为主，土法先上马的办法不感兴趣；对自力更生，克服困难的精神还没有充分发挥等。这些都必须通过整风和在实际工作中加以认真解决，以便正确地贯彻执行中央提出的工农业同时并举、大中小企业同时并举以及
  “四为”“三就”“二主”“一自”的方针原则。与此同时，要反复强调树立共产主义风格，解放思想，破除迷信，发扬广大工农群众的创造性，把技术革新运动普遍深入地开展起来。
    其次，不能把领导工业生产看作是分工的几个同志的事情，而应当是全党办工业。党委对工业生产方面的重大问题，必须进行认真的讨论，并定期地进行检查。城市党委的第一书记，应把主要力量放在工业生产方面，地、县党委的第一书记和乡委书记应真正做到一手抓农业，一手抓工业。有铁、煤地区的地委和县委的第一书记还必须亲自动手，抓钢铁和煤、焦。
