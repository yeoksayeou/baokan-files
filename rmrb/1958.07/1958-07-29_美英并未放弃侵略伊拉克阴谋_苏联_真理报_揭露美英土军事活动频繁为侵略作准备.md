Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 26th: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article today stating that in recent days, the reactionary press of the United States and Britain has written much to suggest that the ruling groups of these countries have abandoned their plans to intervene in Iraq and have decided only to occupy Lebanon and Jordan. This is an attempt to deceive world public opinion.

The article said that in its statement on U.S. intervention in Lebanon, the White House frankly linked its acts of aggression to internal events in Iraq. The "New York Post" also recently pointed out that the occupation of Lebanon is merely the prelude to a decision to recapture Iraq by military means.

According to Western press reports, Dulles and the British Foreign Secretary recently reached an agreement on further military action in the Near East during their meeting. The British "Sunday Times" said that this agreement applies not only to Lebanon and Jordan, but also to the Persian Gulf.

The article said that the continued transport of troops by the United States and Britain to the Middle East cannot be explained as being solely for the occupation of Lebanon and Jordan. According to Reuters, Turkish troops are concentrated on the borders of the Iraqi and Syrian regions, carrying out military preparations. The Turkish Foreign Minister said that these measures are preparations for an attack on the Republic of Iraq.

The article pointed out that Jordan occupies a special position in the interventionists' aggressive plans. The interventionists intend to use it as a springboard for an attack on Iraq. King Hussein of Jordan openly told British television reporters on the 24th that he planned to interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic of Iraq.

In addition to preparing for armed intervention, London and Washington also hope to carry out sabotage activities in Iraq. An American magazine said that Dulles and Lloyd believe that if large-scale counter-revolutionary activities do not occur in Iraq, military measures by Jordan and U.S.-British forces will be difficult to take.

    美英并未放弃侵略伊拉克阴谋
    苏联“真理报”揭露美英土军事活动频繁为侵略作准备
    新华社莫斯科26日电　苏联“真理报”今天发表文章说，最近几天，美英反动报刊写了许多东西，似乎这些国家的统治集团已经放弃了干涉伊拉克的计划，并且决定只占领黎巴嫩和约旦。这是企图欺骗世界舆论。
    文章说，白宫在就美国干涉黎巴嫩发表的声明中，就曾坦率地把它的侵略行动和伊拉克内部事件联系起来。“纽约邮报”最近也指出，占领黎巴嫩仅仅是决定用军事方法夺回伊拉克的序幕。
    据西方报刊报道，在不久前杜勒斯和英国外交大臣在会见中达成了一个关于在近东采取进一步军事行动的协议。英国“星期日泰晤士报”说，这个协议不仅贯彻到黎巴嫩和约旦，还贯彻到波斯湾。
    文章说，美英继续向中近东运送军队，无论如何也不能解释为仅是为了占领黎巴嫩和约旦。据路透社报道，土耳其军队集中在伊拉克和叙利亚地区边境，进行军事准备。土耳其外长说，这些措施是进攻伊拉克共和国的准备。
    文章指出，约旦在干涉者的侵略计划中占有特殊的地位。干涉者打算利用它作为进攻伊拉克的跳板。约旦国王侯赛因24日曾公开对英国电视记者说，他计划干涉伊拉克共和国内政。
    除了准备进行武装干涉外，伦敦和华盛顿还指望在伊拉克进行破坏活动。美国一家杂志说，杜勒斯和劳埃德认为，如果在伊拉克不发生大规模反革命活动，约旦和美英军队的军事措施是很难采取的。
