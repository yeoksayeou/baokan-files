    New Topics Waiting to be Answered
    Since this newspaper proposed establishing the "Everyone Raises Topics, Everyone Answers" column on June 25th, we have received a large number of letters from readers in over ten days. These letters can be roughly divided into three categories. The first category expresses agreement and support for this approach of the newspaper. This type of letter is the most numerous, and due to space limitations, we will not publish them in the newspaper. We hope that comrades will actively participate in the work of this column in the future, propose more topics that are conducive to socialist construction, and write more articles that are conducive to socialist construction. The second category contains answers regarding duck raising methods and experiences, and a portion of these are published in this newspaper today. The third category raises topics and requests readers from various places to "write articles" about them. There are dozens of these topics, covering a very wide range of areas, such as someone proposing how to massively develop artificial rain, and someone proposing scientific research topics such as making beans grow on trees and grain grow on trees. However, the largest and most concentrated topics are still those that urgently need to be resolved in current agricultural production. After our comprehensive organization and sorting, these issues are mainly the following:
    1. This year, various regions have planted a large number of tubers, and the output of tubers will inevitably increase greatly. How to utilize and store tubers is a major issue. Many readers wrote to ask: How should tubers be preserved after harvest to avoid mold and rot? How should they be processed to have greater economic and nutritional value? We hope to introduce some experience and methods for processing and utilization; some people also request recommendations for high-efficiency new-style slicing (or shredding) processing tools.
    2. During the Great Leap Forward, rice was mostly planted densely and grew very vigorously, but according to experience in various places, rice is prone to lodging after heading and flowering. How can lodging be prevented? What aspects should be paid attention to from seed selection to planting and field management? What are some effective methods?
    3. Our country is a country rich in fruits. How can we make fruits grow better and bear more fruit, thereby increasing export materials and improving people's lives? How can we ensure that fruit trees have a "good year" and a good harvest every year?
    We believe that these questions raised by readers are all very good and very important. We hope that readers from all over the country—agricultural cooperative members, cadres, scientific and technical personnel, as well as experienced workers and urban residents—will actively participate in the discussion of these issues and write articles on these topics, turning everyone's beneficial experience and knowledge into the wealth of the whole people.

### 新的题目等着回答

专栏：

    新的题目等着回答
    本报6月25日提出建立“大家出题目，大家来回答”栏目以来，十多天内，收到了大量的读者来信。这些来信大致可分成三类。一类是表示赞成和拥护本报这种作法的。这类来信最多，限于报纸篇幅，不准备在报上发表了。希望同志们今后热烈参加这一栏目的工作，多提有利于社会主义建设的题目，多作有利于社会主义建设的文章。另一类是回答关于养鸭方法、经验的，今天本报发表的就是其中一部分。第三类是提出题目，请求各地读者“作文章”的。这些题目有几十个，包括的方面非常广泛，如有人提出如何大量发展人造雨问题，有人提出使树上结豆子、长粮食等科学研究题目，但最大量最集中的还是当前农业生产上迫切需要解决的问题。这些问题经过我们综合整理，主要有下面几个：
    一、今年各地大量种植了薯类，薯类的产量势必大大增加，怎样利用和储藏薯类，这是个大问题。许多读者来信问：薯类收获后怎样保存，才不致发生霉烂现象？怎样处理才有更大的经济价值和营养价值？希望介绍一些加工利用的经验和方法；还有人要求推荐效率高的新式切片（或切丝）加工工具。
    二、在大跃进中，水稻大都实行了密植，长的很壮，但根据各地的经验，水稻在吐穗扬花后，常常容易发生倒伏现象。怎样才能防止倒伏？从选种到种植、田间管理等方面有哪些应该注意的问题？有哪些有效的方法？
    三、我国是个盛产水果的国家，怎样使水果长得更好，结得更多，从而增加出口物资和改善人民生活。怎样才能叫果树年年都是“大年”，都是丰收？
    读者提出的这些问题，我们认为都很好，都很重要，希望各地读者——农业社员、干部、科学技术人员以及有经验的工人、城市居民都来热烈地参加这些问题的讨论，都能就这些题目作文章，把每个人的有益经验和知识变成全民的财富。
