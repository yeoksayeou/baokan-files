The 21st team of the Xicheng Agricultural Cooperative created a record of 3,263 jin per mu in their wheat experimental plot. This miracle has added strong wings to the thoughts of every member, and they are flapping their wings and flying to higher places.

**Old People Also Want to Develop High-Yield Fields**

The old farmer Tu Wanming didn't sleep well all night. The next morning, he ran to the cooperative to find the accountant, Gu Cairen, and asked the cooperative to give him a piece of land to use as a high-yield experimental field.

Gu Cairen, a young man just over twenty years old, was one of the four developers of the wheat experimental field. He looked at the wrinkled old farmer in surprise and said, "You are the team's cattle feeder, what do you want an experimental field for?" Tu Wanming stared at the young man's face and began to speak like a string of beads:

"Am I not allowed to develop experimental fields because I am old and my teeth have fallen out? Don't look down on people!"
"Don't always remember that I didn't think highly of your experimental fields last year, now my mind is open!"
"You have produced more than 3,000 jin of wheat, and I, an old man, also want to produce 20,000 jin of rice."

Gu Cairen couldn't get a word in edgewise. Finally, he laughed and said, "Old man, go and pick a piece of land yourself. Our experimental field is aiming for 30,000 jin per mu of rice, what about you?" Tu Wanming said, "You are walking in front, I want to catch up. If I can't catch up this year, I'll catch up next year." He fought for the experimental field, and he was happy to grin, revealing the mouth that had lost a few front teeth, and chuckled. He selected two mu of late japonica rice next to the cattle shed, and the target was 22,000 jin per mu.

These two mu of late japonica rice were originally assigned to be managed by cooperative member Zhao Qingsong. On this day, a small disturbance broke out in the field over the experimental field. Zhao Qingsong said, "I am in charge of this piece of land and plan to produce 20,000 jin per mu!" Tu Wanming said:
"The cooperative has already agreed to give me the experimental field, and I want to produce 22,000 jin per mu." Zhao Qingsong refused, saying "No way," Tu Wanming also refused, saying, "I'm so old, if I don't develop an experimental field, I'll be letting down Chairman Mao. I also want to be a high-yield model and go to Beijing to see him." It was only with great difficulty that the squad leader, Wang Jingcai, persuaded them to cooperate in cultivating this experimental field that the dispute ceased.

Xicheng Cooperative is located west of Maoshan in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province. Musicians have composed a song called "Red Flag Inserted on Maoshan Peak" to praise the heroic deeds of creating the highest wheat yield record in Jiangsu. However, many cooperative members did not believe that the experimental field could produce anything last year. At that time, many people secretly laughed at the target of 900 jin per mu for the wheat experimental field, saying that it was "daydreaming" and "eating the guts of a tiger." Now, the miracle has appeared before their eyes. This high-yield banner is not only planted on Maoshan Peak, but also firmly planted in the hearts of every member of the Xicheng Cooperative. It has unlocked the various superstitions that bind people's minds, and high-yield experimental fields have blossomed everywhere in the Xicheng Cooperative. In addition to dozens of cooperative and team cadres developing 210 mu of high-yield fields, the members are also vying to develop them. The cooperative has a total of 1,210 mu of high-yield rice experimental fields, accounting for one-fifth of the cooperative's rice area, and the yield target is above 10,000 jin. A competition movement of comparing measures, comparing energy, and comparing field management has been launched in the Xicheng Cooperative.

**Let Rice Production Reach 30,000 Jin Per Mu**

In the cadre experimental field striving for 30,000 jin of rice per mu, a red flag with the words "Man Will Conquer Nature" flutters in the dazzling sunlight. Cooperative Director Kong Qingrui, Deputy Director Liu Zhenggang, Accountant Gu Cairen, and 21st Team Production Captain Gu Zhengrong won the Jiangsu wheat championship with "the courage of a tiger and the heart of a girl." Now they want to continue to strive for the top in rice. The Youth Commando Team and the Liu Hulan Production Team participated in the cultivation of this field.

The sun is asleep, and the moon is still hanging in the sky, and the male and female cooperative members go to the field. Shi Caifeng, the leader of the Youth Commando Team, pushed a small cart loaded with 500 jin of fertile mud in front, and they transported all three small mountains of compost to the field. Women went everywhere to cut green grass and send it to the experimental field. At night, under the starry sky, people are still deeply plowing the land in the experimental field.

The cooperative organized an expeditionary force to cut green grass at Chishan Lake, more than ten miles away. On a moonless night, the cooperative members tied the cut grass into bundles and put them in the river, dragging them back like trackers pulling a boat. Some people used bamboo poles to push from behind. People waded through the deep water and mud on the river beach, walking step by step. Someone sank, got up and walked again. Someone said, "We are dragging a water train! It is loaded with grain." Everyone laughed, and laughter and shouts vibrated in the dark night sky.

This experimental field was ploughed two feet deep, one layer of green grass, one layer of fertile mud, another layer of green grass, and another layer of fertile mud, like a sandwich cookie, using the soil turned up from the field to finely and evenly spread the four layers of base fertilizer in the field. The commando team members transported water all night, and raked it again, pulled up ropes to plant seedlings, planting them in one-inch squares, leaving a five- or six-inch path every three feet to facilitate weeding and topdressing. People cultivated the experimental field with the meticulous care of a girl.

The high-pitched sound of waterwheel songs accompanied by the soft sound of gongs and drums echoed in the valley day and night:

A burst of gongs and drums, the sun is shining, a burst of cloudy weather
Wu Song fights the tiger, a good reputation
Everyone should learn from the hero
Foolish Old Man moves the mountain without fear of difficulties
Brothers, work hard...

The commando team members were beating gongs and drums while singing on the waterwheel. Their purple-bronze faces and bodies were covered with sweat, as if they had been rained on. The gongs and drums were getting tighter and tighter, and they stepped even more joyfully. The splashing white water shone brightly in the sun.

The cooperative members, who have liberated their minds, are full of energy and enthusiastically learning various new technologies. In addition to increasing the accumulation of natural fertilizers this year, each production team is preparing to build a local fertilizer factory. Luo Gufeng, the deputy director in charge of industry in the cooperative, and technician Zhang Yinfeng worked hard for two days and nights, using manure, alum, and nitric acid to make three large pots of local fertilizer, the color of which was as white as fertilizer powder. Each production team sent people to the cooperative to learn. The old farmer Tu Wanming was also sent. He carefully remembered the proportion of various raw materials, and he excitedly said to people: "In the past, I was ideologically conservative and had never touched these new things. Now, for the sake of the experimental field, I must learn new methods of farming!"

The production team leaders are working harder than the cooperative members. They have all responded to the challenge from the 21st team and want to compete in rice. Late at night, when the cooperative members rested, they still walked all over the fields to check which field was short of water, which field had weeds, and which field should be topdressed, so as to arrange the next day's labor and ensure shallow water frequent irrigation, topdressing according to the seedlings, and no weeds in the field. Now, the early rice has already headed, the middle rice is more than one foot high, and the late rice has all survived and turned green. Standing on the hill, the view is full of lush green, and the rice fields are connected high and low, full of life.

**Select a Representative to Go to Beijing**

When I left the cooperative, the county sent a notice that the cooperative should send a representative to Beijing to participate in the agricultural high-yield symposium. This good news touched the hearts of every member. The cooperative sent Gu Cairen as a representative to Beijing. The cooperative members worked even more happily, and loud songs fluttered in the fields again.

We are weeding in the fields
Good seedlings grow in the fields
Good seedlings...
The heroes of Xicheng Cooperative are going to Beijing
Everyone's heart is blooming
Hearts are blooming...
We want to catch up with the heroes
Catch up with the heroes to see Chairman Mao
To see Chairman Mao...

    他们飞向更高处
    本报记者　古平
    西城农业社二十一队创造了小麦试验田亩产三千二百六十三斤的纪录，这奇迹给每个社员的思想添上了矫健的双翼，他们在振翅向更高处飞翔。
    老人也要搞丰产田
    老农涂万明一夜没有睡好觉，第二天一早，跑到社里找会计顾采仁，要社里给一块田给他做丰产试验田。
    顾采仁是个刚满二十岁的小伙子，也是小麦试验田四个培育人之一。他惊奇地望着这个满脸皱纹的老农说：“你是队里的耕牛饲养员，要试验田做什么？”涂万明紧瞅着小伙子的脸，连珠炮似的说开了：
    “我年纪大了，牙齿掉了，就不能搞试验田吗？别瞧不起人！”
    “别老记着去年我看不上你们的试验田，现在我的脑子开了窍啦！”
    “你们干出了三千多斤的小麦，我老头子也想干个双万斤的水稻哩。”
    顾采仁想插一句嘴都插不上，最后，他乐得笑迷迷地说：“老爹，你自己去挑一块田吧，我们的试验田争取水稻亩产三万，你呢？”涂万明说：“你们是走在前面了，我要赶，今年赶不上，明年再赶。”他争到了试验田，也乐得咧开缺了几颗门牙的嘴巴，呵呵地笑了起来。他挑选了一块紧靠牛房的两亩晚粳，指标订的是亩产两万二千斤。
    这两亩晚粳，原来是分工给社员赵清松管理的。这天，田头上起了一场争试验田的小小风波。赵清松说：“我是这块田的负责人，打算搞两万斤一亩哩！”涂万明说：
  “社里已经答应给我做试验田了，我要搞两万二千斤一亩。”赵清松不答应，说“不行”，涂万明也不答应，说：“我这大年纪了，再不搞块试验田，对不住毛主席，我还想当丰产模范上北京去见见他老人家呢。”小队长王敬才好容易说服了他们两个人合作培育这块试验田，争论才停歇了。
    西城社在江苏省句容县茅山之西。音乐家们编了一首“红旗插上茅山峰”的歌子，歌颂这创江苏小麦产量最高纪录的英雄事迹。但是，很多社员在去年是不相信试验田能搞出什么名堂来的。当时，很多人对小麦试验田亩产九百斤的指标暗暗发笑，都说这是在说“梦话”，是“吃了老虎胆”。现在呢，奇迹就出现在眼前，这面高产的旗帜不仅插上了茅山峰，也牢牢地插在西城社每一个社员的心上了。它解开了束缚人们思想的种种迷信，高产试验田已经在西城社遍地开花。除了几十名社、队干部搞了二百一十亩丰产田外，社员们也都争着搞。全社水稻高产试验田共一千二百一十亩，占全社水稻面积的五分之一，产量指标都在万斤以上。一个比措施、比干劲、比田间管理好的竞赛运动已热火朝天地在西城社展开了。
    让水稻亩产三万斤
    在争取亩产水稻三万斤的干部试验田里，一杆写着“人定胜天”的红旗在耀眼的阳光下迎风招展。社主任孔庆瑞、副主任刘正刚、会计顾采仁、二十一队生产队长顾正荣四个人，以“老虎的胆、姑娘的心”夺取了江苏小麦冠军的荣誉，现在他们又要在水稻方面继续力争上游。青年突击队和刘胡兰生产队参加了这块田的耕作。
    太阳在沉睡，月亮还挂在天边，男女社员们就下田了。青年突击队长施才丰推着装有五百斤肥泥的小车走在前面，他们把三座小山似的堆肥全部运到田里。妇女们到处割青草往试验田里送。晚上，满天繁星，人们还在试验田里深翻土地。
    社里组织了远征军到十多里以外的赤山湖割青草。在一个没有月亮的夜里，社员们把割好的草一捆捆地联起来，放在河里，像背纤似的往回拖，有些人用竹篙在后面推。人们涉着河滩上的深水和污泥，一步步地走着。有人陷下去了，爬起来再走。不知谁说了声：“我们拖的是水上火车啊！上面装满着粮食哩。”大家乐开了，笑声、号子声在黑黝黝的夜空中震荡。
    这块试验田翻土二尺深，一层青草，一层肥泥，又一层青草，又一层肥泥，像夹心饼干似的用本田翻起的土把四层基肥精细而均匀地铺在田里。突击队员们连夜车上水，又耙了一遍，拉起绳子莳秧，莳的是一寸见方的行子，每隔三尺留一道五、六寸的人行道，便于锄草和追肥。人们用姑娘般的细心培育着试验田。
    高亢的车水歌声伴着细碎的锣鼓声不分日夜地在山谷间回荡：
    一阵罗嗬太阳哎一阵阴罗
    武松打虎哎好名声噢
    人人要学那英雄汉罗
    愚公移山不怕难
    兄弟们?下劲干罗……
    突击队员们在车上一面敲锣打鼓，一面唱着。紫铜色的脸上和身上流满了汗水，像雨淋的一样。锣鼓一阵紧一阵，他们踏得更欢了。飞溅着的白色水花在阳光下闪闪发亮。
    解放了思想的社员们干劲冲天，热情地学习各种新技术。今年除了增积自然肥料外，每个生产队准备办一个土化肥厂。社里管工业的副主任罗古锋和技术员张银风，苦干了两天两夜，用大粪、明矾、硝镪水加水烧制出三大锅土化肥，颜色和肥田粉一样白。各生产队都派了人到社里学习。老农涂万明也被派去了。他认真地记住各种原料搭配的分量，他兴奋地对人说：“过去我思想保守，也没摸过这些新东西，现在为了试验田，可要好好学习种田的新办法啦！”
    生产队长们比社员干得更起劲，他们都向二十一队应了战，要在水稻上比个高低。深夜里，社员们休息了，他们还要走遍田野，查看哪块田缺水了，哪块田有草了，哪块田该追肥了，好安排第二天的劳动，保证做到浅水勤灌，看苗追肥，田无杂草。现在，早稻已经抽穗，中稻有一尺多高，晚稻都已活棵返青。站在山岗上一望，满眼浓绿，一冲冲的稻田高低毗连，充满了生意。
    选代表上北京
    当我离开这个社的时候，县里来通知，要社里派一个代表到北京去参加农业丰产座谈会。这喜讯打动了每一个社员的心。社里派顾采仁当代表上北京去了，社员们干得更欢了，田野上又飘扬起嘹亮的歌声。
    我们在田里薅秧草哎
    田里长的好秧苗
    好秧苗哦……
    西城社的英雄上北京罗
    人人心花开
    心花开哦……
    我们要把那英雄赶哎
    赶上英雄去见毛主席
    去见毛主席哦……
