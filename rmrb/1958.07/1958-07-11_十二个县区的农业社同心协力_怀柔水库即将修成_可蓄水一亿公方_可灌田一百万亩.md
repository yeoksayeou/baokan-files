Xinhua News Agency, Huairou, July 10th: Another reservoir near the capital, the sister of the Ming Tombs Reservoir - the Huairou Reservoir, is about to be completed. This reservoir officially started construction on March 9th. Now, the main projects such as the earth dam across the river, the water diversion tunnel, the intake gate, and the secondary dam have been basically completed. Only the concrete work of the spillway is still being rushed.

This reservoir is built north of Huairou County, on the Huai River, a tributary of the Chaobai River. Now, people can see from afar the 1,100-meter-long and 20-meter-high earth dam across the river, standing majestically between two hills, cutting off the Huai River, and proudly awaiting the test of the flood season. This reservoir can store 100 million cubic meters of water. During the flood season, it can reduce the flood peak of the Chaobai River, reduce flood disasters for 25,000 mu of farmland on both sides of the Huai River, and irrigate one million mu of farmland below the reservoir.

Premier Zhou Enlai visited the construction site on the morning of June 26th to inquire about the labor and living conditions of the migrant workers. The construction of this reservoir is a public-private partnership. More than 60,000 migrant workers come from agricultural cooperatives in twelve counties and districts, most of whom are farmers from indirectly benefiting and non-benefiting counties and districts. They came with the enthusiasm to work together to build socialism and jointly leap forward. The migrant workers brought their own tools and grain, and the agricultural cooperatives provided the sheds and cooking utensils. The state subsidy investment is only 3.5 million yuan, mainly used to purchase steel, cement, explosives, lighting equipment, etc. This reservoir is one of the many reservoirs to be built in the Hai River control plan. It was originally planned to start construction during the Third Five-Year Plan period. However, the farmers were encouraged by the victory in the Great Leap Forward in production, so they greatly advanced the start date. Premier Zhou highly praised the migrant workers for giving full play to the collective strength of the agricultural cooperatives to build large-scale reservoirs in a faster, better and more economical way. He said this was a manifestation of the communist spirit.

When the decision was made to start the reservoir project, there were only three months left before the flood season, but people believed in the power of the masses and were determined to race against the flood, and they were determined to seize the lead before the flood. In the process of construction, enthusiastic assistance was received from 70 units including the People's Liberation Army, relevant agencies of Beijing, and schools, including engineering design, geological exploration, power supply, and rolling machinery, which played a huge role in boosting the morale of the migrant workers and accelerating the completion of the reservoir. In early June, the people building the reservoir created an amazing record of filling more than 32,000 cubic meters of soil on the dam for four consecutive days. (Attached photo)

### 十二个县区的农业社同心协力  怀柔水库即将修成  可蓄水一亿公方  可灌田一百万亩

    十二个县区的农业社同心协力
    怀柔水库即将修成
    可蓄水一亿公方  可灌田一百万亩
    新华社怀柔10日电　首都附近的另一座水库、十三陵水库的姊妹——怀柔水库即将完工。这座水库从3月9日正式施工，现在拦河土坝输水隧洞、进水闸、副坝等几项主要工程都已基本完工，仅溢洪道的混凝土工程还在赶浇中。
    这座水库建在怀柔县城北、潮白河支流怀河上。现在人们很远就可以望见长一千一百公尺、高二十公尺的拦河土坝，气势雄伟地横在两个山头之间，截断了怀河，傲然地在等待着汛期来临的考验。这座水库可蓄水一亿公方，洪水期可以降低潮白河的洪峰，减免怀河两岸二万五千亩农田的洪水灾害，并可灌溉水库以下的百万亩农田。
    周恩来总理曾经在6月26日上午来到工地，询问民工们的劳动和生活情况。这座水库的修建由民办公助。六万多民工来自十二个县、区的农业社，其中大部分是间接受益和非受益县、区的农民，他们是怀着同心协力建设社会主义，共同跃进的热情而来的。民工们自己带来了工具和粮食，工棚和炊事用具由农业社筹办。国家补助的投资仅三百五十万元，主要用于购置钢筋、水泥、炸药、照明设备等。这座水库是根治海河规划中要兴修的许多座水库中的一座，原计划在第三个五年计划期间才动工。但是农民们在生产大跃进中受到胜利的鼓舞，因此把开工时间大大提前了。周总理对民工们发挥农业社的集体力量，多快好省地修建规模较大水库的壮举十分赞扬，他说这是共产主义精神的表现。
    这座水库工程决定开工时离汛期只有三个多月，但人们相信群众的力量，决心要和洪水赛跑，定要抢在洪水的前头，就这样毅然决然地穷干苦干起来了。在修建过程中，得到了解放军、北京市有关机关、学校等七十个单位的热情援助，包括工程设计、地质钻探、供电和辗压机械等，对鼓舞民工们的干劲、加快水库的建成起了巨大作用。在6月上旬，修建水库的人们曾连续四天创造在坝上填土三万二千多公方的惊人成绩。（附图片）
