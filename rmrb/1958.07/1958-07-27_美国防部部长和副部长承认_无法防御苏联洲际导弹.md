Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 26th: U.S. Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy and Under Secretary of Defense Quarles said on the 24th that the United States currently has no way to defend against Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles, and "in the foreseeable future" will have no way to defend against them.

McElroy said while testifying before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee: "At present, we do not have the means to shoot down a ballistic missile." Quarles said, "In a technical sense, I don't think we have sufficient ability to defend against missiles in the foreseeable future."

Both officials said that they did not know if U.S. countermeasures against such missiles could be prepared "in time." McElroy said: "We hope to be able to. But we don't know."

The chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee, Democratic Senate Leader Johnson, expressed "disappointment" at the backward state of the U.S. military, accusing the Pentagon of still lacking a "serious sense of urgency" in preparing for a world war. McElroy did not admit to this accusation. He said that he would present some examples to show that the Pentagon "does have a sense of urgency."

    美国防部部长和副部长承认
    无法防御苏联洲际导弹
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊和副部长卡利斯24日说，对于苏联的洲际弹道导弹，美国现在没有，同时“在可以预见的将来”也没有防御的方法。
    麦克耳罗伊在参议院军备小组委员会作证时说：“在目前，我们没有击落一枚弹道导弹的工具。”卡利斯说，“在技术意义上说，我不认为我们在可以预见的将来有防御导弹的足够能力。”
    这两位官员都说，他们不知道美国对付这种导弹的反措施是不是可以“及时”准备。麦克耳罗伊说：“我们希望能够。但是我们不知道。”
    军备小组委员会主席、民主党参议院领袖约翰逊对美国的军事落后状态表示“失望”，他指责五角大楼在准备进行世界大战方面仍然缺乏一种“严重的迫切感”。麦克耳罗伊不承认这个指责。他说，他将提出一些例证来表明五角大楼“是存在一种迫切感的”。
