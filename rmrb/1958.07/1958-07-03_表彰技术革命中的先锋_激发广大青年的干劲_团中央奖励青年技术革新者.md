Xinhua News Agency, 2nd July – The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China issued a circular on July 1st, rewarding a group of young people and advanced youth collectives who have made creative inventions in the industrial and agricultural technological revolution.

The circular from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League stated: "Our great technological revolution movement is developing vigorously. In this movement, tens of thousands of young innovators and inventors have emerged. In order to commend their contributions to the motherland, disseminate their advanced ideas and experiences, and inspire more young people to dare to break superstitions and actively participate in the technological and cultural revolutions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has decided to issue certificates of merit to the young people with the most outstanding achievements in the technological revolution movement.

"The young people who have received awards this time were not experts, doctors, or celebrities, but mostly ordinary workers and farmers with limited experience and technical skills. The reason they were able to make creative inventions in science and technology is that they were encouraged by the Party's General Line, possessed a high degree of socialist consciousness, and had a fearless spirit of innovation – daring to think and act, studying diligently, and not being bound by outdated conventions. The fact that they have made inventions and creations proves once again that science and technology are not mysterious, and that any worker who works diligently and has a spirit of inquiry can contribute to the development of science and technology. Their spirit of innovation is worthy of study by young people throughout the country. What they have been able to do, other young people can also do. Every young person should actively study and boldly create in their own position, and strive to make greater contributions to the cause of socialist construction."
