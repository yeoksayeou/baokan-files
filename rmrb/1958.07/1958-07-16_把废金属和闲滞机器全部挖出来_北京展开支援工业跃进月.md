Xinhua News Agency, July 15th. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee jointly decided on the 14th to launch a mass movement month to support the great leap forward in industry from July 16th to August 16th throughout the city in all industrial and mining construction enterprises, commerce, service industries, transportation, government offices, military units, schools, hospitals, streets, and rural areas.

The purpose of launching this movement month is to strive for a greater leap forward in industrial production and industrial capital construction this autumn and winter, and to overcome the temporary shortage of steel and other materials that has occurred under the new situation of the great leap forward in industry. It was decided to call on all workers, farmers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, teachers, students, cadres, and residents of the city to actively participate in this movement, using their brains and hands to quickly, thoroughly, and completely dig out all scrap iron, scrap copper, and other metal materials, as well as idle machinery and equipment, from all aspects and corners to support the great leap forward in industrial production and industrial construction. The decision stated that all metal materials and machinery and equipment unearthed will be acquired or allocated or exchanged by the competent authorities according to prices, instead of being donated. In terms of distribution, priority should be given to ensuring the construction of key projects and the production needs of metallurgy, power generation equipment, and machine tools.

All districts in Beijing have established headquarters to carry out this movement.
