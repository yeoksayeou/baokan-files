Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 9th. The Cambodian National Assembly passed a resolution on the 8th expressing complete confidence in Prince Sihanouk. The resolution stated: The National Assembly absolutely refuses to trust anyone other than Prince Sihanouk, especially those who support the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The resolution stated: Because we adhere to neutralism, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has never ceased harassing us up to now.

On the same day, the National Assembly held a secret meeting to elect ten members to participate in the future cabinet. Prior to this, Prince Sihanouk had requested members to elect ten ministers and state secretaries from among themselves to participate in his cabinet, because the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization had attacked Sihanouk, saying that he did not allow talented members to participate in the cabinet.

    柬国民议会通过决议
    表示信任西哈努克
    据新华社金边9日电  柬埔寨国民议会8日通过了一项决议，表示完全信任西哈努克亲王。决议说：国民议会绝对拒绝信任除了西哈努克亲王以外的任何一个人，特别是支持东南亚条约组织的人。决议说：由于我们奉行中立主义，东南亚条约组织直到现在为止从未停止过对我们的骚扰。
    同一天，国民议会秘密会议选举了十位议员参加未来的内阁。在此以前，西哈努克亲王曾经要求议员在他们中间选举十位大臣和国务秘书，参加他的内阁，因为东南亚条约组织曾经攻击西哈努克，说他不让有才能的议员参加内阁。
