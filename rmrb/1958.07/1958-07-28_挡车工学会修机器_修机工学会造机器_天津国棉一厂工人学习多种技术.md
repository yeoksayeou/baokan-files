Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 27th: Workers at the Tianjin No. 1 State-Owned Cotton Factory are carrying out "multi-skilled" activities to learn various technologies.

It has been a convention for over sixty years in China's cotton textile industry that carding operators do not repair machines. Workers in the spinning workshop of the No. 1 State-Owned Cotton Factory have broken this convention, and more than 170 carding and doffing operators have learned the maintenance technology for some parts of the spinning machines. Since May of this year, when the factory's workers began participating in enterprise management, their sense of responsibility for production and enterprise management has strengthened. However, according to the factory's system, if a machine has a minor fault, a foreman or maintenance worker must be found to repair it. Sometimes, if they cannot be found, a broken spindle has to wait four or five hours, or even a day, to be repaired. The workers of Group 2 of Class A in the first spinning workshop were the first to propose to the factory leadership that carding operators should learn to repair machines. The workers believe that most of the carding operators in our group have been working around the machines for more than ten years, and as long as we muster enough energy and break superstitions, we will definitely be able to become masters of the machines. With the help of Deputy Foreman Liu Fengwu, all sixteen female workers and nine male workers in this group have learned the maintenance technology for some parts of the spinning machines in just one month. Now, the machine is placed next to the tool cart in this group, and when a fault is found, it is immediately repaired. Therefore, the end breakage rate of the spinning machine has been reduced. In June, this group completed the leap forward plan to reduce roller lapping. At present, workers in the opening and cleaning, carding, drawing, and roving processes in this factory have also launched "multi-skilled" activities.

More than 160 repair and maintenance workers in the factory's repair workshop are also engaged in machine manufacturing. The fitters and lathe operators in the entire workshop are required to learn various technologies such as model making, sand casting, smelting, sheet metal, and welding, on the premise of being proficient in their own technical skills. They are determined to turn the machine repair workshop into a factory capable of manufacturing various machines. In the past, the copper work such as copper melting and copper mold casting in this workshop had to be sent to outside factories for processing. Now, they have not only learned to do it themselves, but also created a "fully enclosed automatic trolley lifting furnace," which can improve copper melting efficiency and prevent workers from being poisoned during operation.

### 挡车工学会修机器  修机工学会造机器  天津国棉一厂工人学习多种技术

    天津国棉一厂工人学习多种技术
    新华社天津27日电　天津国棉一厂的工人正在开展学习多种技术的“多面手”活动。
    棉纺织厂挡车工人不修理机器，这是我国棉纺织工业六十多年的常规。国棉一厂细纱车间的工人突破了这个常规，已有一百七十多名挡车工和落纱工学会了细纱机部分机件的检修技术。从今年5月，这个厂的工人参加企业管理以后，大家对生产和企业管理的责任心加强了。但是按照这个厂的制度，机器出了点毛病一定要找工长或保全工修理；有时找不到，一个坏锭子就得等四、五个小时，甚至一天才能修好。第一细纱车间甲班二组的工人们首先向工厂领导提出了挡车工应学习检修机器的建议。工人们认为：我们小组的大部分挡车工，都围绕着机器转过十几年，只要鼓足了干劲，破除迷信，就一定能做机器的主人。在副工长刘凤梧的帮助下，仅仅在一个月内，这个小组的十六名女工和九名男工已全部学会了细纱机部分机件的检修技术。现在这个小组的机器旁边放着工具车，发现机器出了毛病，就马上修理。因此细纱机的断头率减少了。六月份这个小组完成了降低皮辊花的跃进计划。目前，这个厂的清花、钢丝、并条、粗纱等工序的工人，也开展了“多面手”活动。
    这个厂修机车间的一百六十多名修机和保全工人，也大搞机器制造。全车间的钳工、车工，在精通本行技术的条件下，还要求人人学会模型制造、翻砂、冶炼、白铁、烧焊等多种技术。他们决心使修理机器的车间，变成个能制造各种机器的工厂。过去这个车间的化铜、铸铜模等铜活都要拿到外厂去加工，现在他们不仅自己学会做，而且创造了一种“全封闭自动滑车起罐铜炉”，既可以提高化铜效率，又能防止工人操作时中毒。
