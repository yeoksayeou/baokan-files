Xinhua News Agency, July 17th, Tokyo Dispatch: While openly dispatching troops to brazenly interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, the United States has ordered its troops stationed in Japan and South Korea to be on combat alert, in order to create tension in the Far East.

According to Lieutenant General Smith, commander of the U.S. forces stationed in Japan, on the 16th, "Appropriate measures have been taken to strengthen the alert status of the Fifth Air Force."

A spokesperson for the headquarters of the U.S. Naval Forces in Japan also said that all ships in the Pacific and the Far East, including the Seventh Fleet, are maintaining a state of readiness to act within four hours of notification. He said: "All leaves have been cancelled, because these ships must be ready to depart immediately and sail to any designated destination."

According to a report by United Press International, the U.S. aggressor troops in South Korea are also believed to be on combat alert.

Xinhua News Agency, July 18th, Tokyo Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower yesterday wrote a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, requesting the Japanese government to "cooperate" with the U.S. policy of aggression against Middle Eastern countries.

After receiving Eisenhower's letter, Nobusuke Kishi immediately convened a cabinet meeting today to discuss the policy Japan should adopt towards the U.S. and British aggression against Middle Eastern countries. The instructions issued by Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi at the meeting emphasized that Japan should "do its utmost to persist in having the United Nations try to clean up the mess." Kishi Nobusuke's instructions are consistent with the U.S. attempt to steal the United Nations flag to "legitimize" its armed aggression against Arab countries.

The Kishi Nobusuke government wants to follow the U.S. war policy in order to make a fortune like it did during the Korean War to extricate itself from the current economic crisis, but it is afraid that openly supporting the war will be condemned by the Japanese people and the Asian and African people and lose its market in the Middle East. Therefore, the Kishi Nobusuke government has adopted a two-faced policy. On the 17th, Takeso Shimoda, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Japanese Embassy in the United States, also expressed support for the U.S. aggression policy during a meeting with Wilcox, Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs of the U.S. State Department.

At the same time, Japan is also secretly preparing to participate in the United Nations "police force" in order to serve as an accomplice in the U.S. armed aggression against Arab countries.

    艾森豪威尔要岸信介政府当帮凶
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：美国在公然出兵无耻干涉中东国家人民内政的同时，命令它驻日本和南朝鲜的军队处于战斗准备状态，以在远东制造紧张局势。
    据驻日本美军司令史密斯中将16日说，“已经采取适当措施加强第五航空队的戒备状态”。
    驻日本美海军部队总部的发言人也说，在太平洋和远东的一切舰只，包括第七舰队，保持着在接到通知后四小时就可以行动起来的戒备。他说：“一切休假都取消了，因为这些舰只必须随时准备立即出发，驶往任何被指定的目的地。”
    据合众国际社报道，在南朝鲜的美国侵略军据信也已经处于战斗准备状态。
    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔昨天写信给日本首相岸信介，要求日本政府对美国侵略中近东国家的政策“实行合作。”
    岸信介收到艾森豪威尔的信件后，即在今天召开内阁会议，讨论了日本对美英两国侵略中东国家所应采取的方针。日本首相岸信介在会上发出的指示强调，日本要“竭尽全力坚持由联合国设法收拾局面”。岸信介的指示是和美国的企图盗用联合国的旗帜使它武装侵略阿拉伯国家的行动“合法化”的意图一致的。
  岸信介政府想追随美国的战争政策，以便像在朝鲜战争时期那样发笔横财来解脱目前的经济危机，但是又害怕公开支持战争会遭到日本人民和亚非人民的谴责并且失去在中近东的市场。因此，岸信介政府采取了两面政策。17日日本驻美国大使馆临时代办下田武三同美国国务院负责国际组织事务的助理国务卿韦尔科克斯举行会谈时也表示支持美国的侵略政策。
    同时，日本还在背地里积极准备参加联合国“警察部队”，以便充当美国武装侵略阿拉伯国家的帮凶。
