Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, 29th: According to TASS, the Norwegian Social Democratic Party published an open letter in the newspaper to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting that a major power conference be convened quickly to peacefully resolve the Middle East issue. The letter stated: "The recent developments in the Near East have caused great anxiety among the people. People feel that the Third World War is not far away. The measures taken by the United States and the United Kingdom in Lebanon and Jordan pose a serious threat to peace and contain unpredictable consequences. In this serious situation, it is necessary to seek agreement through diplomatic channels as quickly as possible to rid the world of the threat looming over it."

The letter stated: "The Norwegian Social Democrats resolutely demand that the major powers and the Secretary-General of the United Nations convene a meeting as quickly as possible to strive for a thorough and peaceful resolution of the Near East issue. A global disaster should be prevented. The responsibility to humanity should be above all else."
