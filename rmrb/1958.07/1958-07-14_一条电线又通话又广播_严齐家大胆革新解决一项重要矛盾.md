One Wire for Both Telephone and Broadcast
Yan Qijia Boldly Innovates and Solves a Major Contradiction

    This newspaper reports that Yan Qijia, the director of the Yunmeng County Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Hubei Province, with the dauntless spirit of "Why not dare to think of flying to the heavens," and together with mechanic Cheng Ruiqing, created the experience of opening wired broadcasting with a "phantom circuit." This enabled simultaneous operation of telephone and broadcasting within the county, changing the long-standing phenomenon where opening broadcasting within the county required stopping telephone service to the townships. Currently, thirty-six post and telecommunications bureaus in sixteen provinces and cities have voluntarily learned from their experience.
    After agricultural cooperativization, rural telephone and wired broadcasting services were universally developed in various regions. However, wired broadcasting borrowed telephone lines, and each night when broadcasting was opened, telephone service to the townships had to be stopped. This year, with the great leap forward in agriculture, telephone services greatly increased, intensifying the contradiction between telephone and broadcasting. Before Yan Qijia and others created this experience, the only way to solve this problem was to add a pair of lines, but erecting a pair of lines cost two hundred and fifty yuan per kilometer, and there were not enough telecommunications materials. With the creation of Yan Qijia and others, including line coils and safety equipment, it only cost more than five yuan to enable a pair of lines, stretching several kilometers or tens of kilometers, to simultaneously operate telephone and broadcasting, allowing telephone services to the townships to be unobstructed day and night.
    Yan Qijia was originally a hired farmhand who became the deputy secretary of the district party committee. He was transferred to the post and telecommunications bureau in May 1954. When he first arrived, he was met with indifference and difficulties from some who considered themselves experts, who said he was "an outsider, taking money and not working, unable to do things." From then on, he was determined to learn technology from the masses, so that he not only became familiar with the production process, but also could do some simple operations. At the beginning of this year, he responded to the call of the county party committee and always considered "how to support the great leap forward in agriculture" when developing post and telecommunications services, first making "township-level switchboards" a reality throughout the county. After that, he discovered that the contradiction between telephone and broadcasting services had greatly intensified in the great leap forward in agriculture. Based on the old experience that "phantom circuits" could allow two pairs of telephones to talk on one pair of lines simultaneously, he proposed the idea of using "phantom circuits" to allow broadcasting and telephone to operate simultaneously. Initially, Cheng Ruiqing, who cooperated with him, also thought it was impossible, saying he was "thinking of flying to the heavens." But with the bold spirit of innovation of "Why not dare to think of flying to the heavens," he mobilized Cheng Ruiqing to experiment with him, and succeeded in the experiment on March 11.

    一条电线又通话又广播
    严齐家大胆革新解决一项重要矛盾
    本报讯　湖北省云梦县邮电局局长严齐家以“为什么不敢想上天”的大无畏精神，和机务员程瑞卿一起创造出用“幻线”开放有线广播的经验，使县内的电话与广播同时开放，改变了长期存在的县内开放广播就必须停止各乡电话的现象。目前已有十六个省三十六个县（市）邮电局自动学习他们这个经验。
    在农业合作化以后，各地普遍发展了农村电话与有线广播的业务，但有线广播是借用的电话线路，每晚开放广播就必须停止各乡电话。今年农业大跃进，各地电话业务大大增加，使电话与广播的矛盾加深。在严齐家等人创造这个经验以前，只有用增加一对线路的办法才能解决这个问题，而架设一对线路每公里得花二百五十元，同时也没有这么多电信器材。用严齐家等人的这个创造，连线圈和安全设备在内，只花五元多钱，就能使一对长达数公里、数十公里的线路同时开放电话与广播，使各乡电话日夜畅通无阻。
    严齐家原是长工出身的区委副书记，1954年5月才调到邮电局工作。他刚去就遭到某些以内行自居者的冷淡与为难，说他“是个外行，拿钱吃饭，不能作事”，他从此下定狠心向群众学技术，使自己不仅熟悉生产过程，还能动手做一些简单的操作。今年年初，他响应县委号召，始终围绕“怎样支援农业大跃进”来考虑开展邮电业务，首先使全县做到了“乡乡总机化”。此后，他又发现电话与广播业务的矛盾在农业大跃进中大大加深，就根据“幻线”能使两对电话同时在一对线路上通话的旧经验，提出了用“幻线”使广播与电话同时开放的想法。最初，与他合作的程瑞卿也认为不可能，说他“想上了天”。但他就以“为什么不敢想上天”的大胆革新精神，动员程瑞卿和他一道试验，并在3月11日试验成功。
