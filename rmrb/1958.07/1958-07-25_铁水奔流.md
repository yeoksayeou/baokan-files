    Molten Iron Flows

    Around 11 o'clock on the night of the 20th, in the courtyard of Beijing No. 2 Middle School, many people were intently watching the molten iron flowing from the smelting furnace. "Success! Success!" People were ecstatic! Even teachers and students who were already asleep jumped out of bed, cheering and applauding.

    More than one hundred teachers, students, and workers from No. 2 Middle School started working on industry on the second day of their summer vacation. They lined large gasoline barrels and large iron ladles from the kitchen with refractory clay, cylinder sand, and coke powder, turning them into smelting furnaces and molten iron ladles. They gathered three half-horsepower blowers used for cooking together to replace the blower used for smelting. They also collected some scrap iron from the school. On the night of the 19th, they conducted the first experiment. Because the bottom of the furnace was not dry, the molten iron solidified and could not flow out. The second experiment failed due to insufficient wind power. However, with the help of the workers, and after improvements, the third experiment finally succeeded.

    Now, they have built a steelmaking earth furnace and are preparing to make steel in the near future.

    铁水奔流
    20日夜十一点左右，在北京市第二中学的院子里，许多人正聚精会神地注视着化铁炉出的铁水。“成功了！成功了！”人们沸腾了！连已经睡着的老师和学生也从床上跳起来，欢呼鼓掌。
    第二中学的一百多个师生和工友，在暑假第二天，就动手办起了工业。他们把大汽油桶和厨房里的大铁勺子抹上了耐火土、缸砂和焦炭末，就成了化铁炉和铁水端勺。把三个做饭用的半马力的吹风机聚在一起，代替化铁用的鼓风机。他们又在学校里收集到一些废铁。19日晚上进行了第一次试验，由于炉底没有干，铁水凝结，流不出来；第二次试验，由于风力不足，又失败了。但是在工人的帮助下，经过改进，第三次试验终于成功了。
    现在，他们已经修起了炼钢的地炉，准备要在最近炼出钢。
