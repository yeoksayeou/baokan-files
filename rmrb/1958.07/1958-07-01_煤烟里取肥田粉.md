    Extracting Fertilizer from Coal Smoke
    (Our Newspaper) News: The Binsun Salt Factory in Santai, Sichuan Province, uses Guangyuan County coal with a sulfur content of 2.27% to boil salt. It utilizes the coal smoke in the chimney and salt water to refine ammonium sulfate (i.e., fertilizer).
    This significant discovery will play a huge role in increasing China's fertilizer production. Judging from the situation of this salt factory alone, if every 100 catties of coal can extract four catties of ammonium sulfate from the coal smoke, the entire factory can refine 130 tons of ammonium sulfate from the coal smoke annually. If it is promoted in all salt factories and salt stoves in the county, about 300 tons of ammonium sulfate can be refined annually, which can fertilize 60,000 mu of land at a rate of ten catties per mu.

    煤烟里取肥田粉
    本报讯　四川省三台宾顺制盐厂，利用含硫2.27％的广元县煤碳熬盐，利用烟囱内的煤烟和盐水，炼出了硫酸铵（即肥田粉）。
    这一重大发现，对增加我国化肥产量，起到巨大的作用。单从这个盐厂的情况来看，如以每百斤煤碳从煤烟中取硫酸铵四斤计算，全厂每年就可在煤烟里炼出一百三十吨硫酸铵。如果在全县盐厂盐灶中推广，每年就可炼出硫酸铵三百吨左右，以每亩施肥十斤计，就可肥田六万亩。　（陈世荣）
