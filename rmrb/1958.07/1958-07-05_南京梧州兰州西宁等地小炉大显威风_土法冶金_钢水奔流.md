Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Nanjing has recently successfully tested three indigenous methods of steelmaking, opening up avenues for the widespread development of the steel industry.

    The first method is an indigenous furnace blowing steelmaking method based on the Bessemer furnace principle. 114 kilograms of Benxi No. 3 pig iron, 36 kilograms of scrap steel, and 240 grams of aluminum are placed in a small iron melting furnace and melted, then poured into a small iron ladle. Side blowing is then performed using an air compressor. The temperature of the molten steel upon exiting the furnace is above 1500 degrees Celsius, producing high carbon steel with a carbon content of 0.98%.
    The second method is crucible steelmaking. Four kilograms of iron ore, two kilograms of Benxi No. 3 pig iron, eight kilograms of limestone, 25 grams of ferromanganese, and eight grams of aluminum are placed in a No. 20 or No. 30 graphite crucible, which is then placed in a cylindrical coal furnace for burning. A 0.25 horsepower centrifugal blower is used for forced ventilation. In this way, the molten steel temperature upon exiting the furnace is 1620 degrees Celsius, and the temperature during casting is around 1540 degrees Celsius, producing low carbon steel with a carbon content of less than 0.23%.
    The third method is crucible blowing steelmaking. Thirty-four kilograms of Benxi No. 3 pig iron, eleven kilograms of scrap steel, and eighty grams of aluminum are placed in a small iron melting furnace and melted, then injected into a preheated No. 80 graphite crucible. A steel pipe coated with good paint is inserted for blowing. The temperature of the molten steel upon exiting the furnace is above 1500 degrees Celsius, producing medium carbon steel with a carbon content of around 0.4%.

    These three indigenous steelmaking methods all use very simple equipment that is easy to manufacture. Generally, construction can be completed in just a few days; the amount of steel materials used is also minimal. In terms of operating techniques, except for the first method, which is more difficult to control, the latter two are relatively simple. Workers without steelmaking experience can master them after only a few days of training.

    The experience of these three indigenous steelmaking methods has been widely promoted in Nanjing industrial enterprises. As of June 30, a total of 44 units in the city had used indigenous methods to produce molten steel.

Xinhua News Agency: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has produced its first batch of steel. On June 23, the newly established steel plant of Wuzhou Sugar Factory took the lead in producing the first furnace of steel. Subsequently, the newly established smelting plant of Wuzhou Shipyard also continuously trial-produced three furnaces of steel. These steels are all high carbon steel and have been technically appraised as being of good quality.

    Wu Qingsong, an advanced producer from Wuzhou Sugar Factory, and several veteran technicians led more than 30 workers to work together for more than fifteen hours. They made blowers and other equipment, then placed the crucible on the furnace, surrounded it with coke for burning, melted the iron, and then used a blower to blow air and send oxygen. About three hours later, they refined forty pounds of steel. The smelting plant of Wuzhou Shipyard had failed twice in the trial smelting process. The staff, full of enthusiasm, put the molten iron from the cupola furnace into a self-made Bessemer converter and sent air with a blower. In about ten minutes, steel was produced.

Xinhua News Agency: Four factories in Gansu have recently used indigenous methods to produce steel one after another. These four factories are Tianshui Agricultural Tool Factory, Lintao Machinery Manufacturing and Distribution Factory, Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Factory, and Lanzhou Flour Mill.

    The steelmaking methods of these factories are relatively simple, but the quality of the steel produced is not bad. Lintao Machinery Manufacturing and Distribution Factory adopted indigenous methods, putting scrap pig iron, aluminum, scrap steel, rough iron, etc. into the crucible in a certain proportion, and blowing air with a hand-cranked blower. After thirty-five minutes, steel was produced. According to experienced veteran workers, the quality of this steel is between medium carbon steel and high carbon steel, and the hardness is very strong. After the first furnace was successfully smelted, they also refined a furnace of manganese alloy steel that night. On the 22nd, Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Factory used a hand-carried small iron ladle to refine the first furnace of steel, which was tested by instruments and found to be medium carbon steel with a wide range of uses.

Xinhua News Agency: Xining Xinsheng Iron Factory, without equipment, experience, or technology, successfully trial-produced the first furnace of standard high carbon steel on June 30.

    This factory used to be a factory producing small machinery and repairing and fitting, and the workers had never thought of making steel. Encouraged by the General Line, they were determined to produce steel. Without furnaces for steelmaking, they used iron sheets and old equipment to manufacture them; lacking steelmaking experience and knowledge, they found some relevant books and studied, learned, and experimented at the same time. After eleven experiments, the carbon content and sulfur content of the steel met the requirements.

Xinhua News Agency: The workers of the forging and casting workshop of the state-owned Xi'an Machinery Factory modified a scrap iron package into a converter and produced the first furnace of steel on the evening of June 30.

    Starting on June 28, the workers were assigned to draw sketches, make models, find materials, build furnaces, find materials, and dig pits, working and exploring at the same time. They found scrap iron packages to manufacture the furnace body, and found ordinary refractory material quartz sand to replace silica bricks; without a blower, they used an iron pipe with a motor to replace it with compressed air. In this way, after thirty-three hours of continuous struggle, the converter was built without spending a penny.

    Preliminary calculations show that this furnace can produce 2,000 tons of steel per year. Such furnaces can be built anywhere there are iron-smelting blast furnaces. (Attached pictures)

    南京梧州兰州西宁等地小炉大显威风
    土法冶金　钢水奔流
    据新华社南京电　南京最近试验成功了三种炼钢的土办法，为普遍发展炼钢工业开辟了途径。
    第一种是按贝氏炉原理用土炉吹风炼钢法，以本溪三号生铁一百一十四公斤、废钢三十六公斤、铝二百四十克，放进小熔铁炉熔化以后，倒入小铁包子，用空气压缩机侧吹，钢水出炉温度在摄氏一千五百度以上，炼成含炭0.98％的高炭钢。
    第二种是坩埚炼钢法，以铁矿石四公斤、本溪三号生铁二公斤、石灰石八公斤、锰铁二十五克、铝八克，放进二十号或三十号的石墨坩埚，然后再放在筒式煤炉中燃烧，用零点二五马力的离心鼓风机吹风加热。这样出炉时钢水温度为摄氏一千六百二十度，浇铸时温度有一千五百四十度左右，炼出含炭0.23％以下的低炭钢。
    第三种是坩埚吹风炼钢法，以本溪三号生铁三十四公斤、废钢十一公斤、铝八十克，放进小熔铁炉熔化后，注入已预热的八十号石墨坩埚内，用上好涂料的钢管插入吹炼。钢水出炉时温度在一千五百度以上，炼成含炭0.4％左右的中炭钢。
    这三种炼钢的土办法，设备都很简单，制造也很方便，一般只要几天就可以建成；钢铁材料用得也极少。在操作技术方面，除了第一种方法较难控制以外，后两种比较简单，没有炼钢经验的工人只要经过几天训练就可以掌握。
    这三种土法炼钢的经验已在南京工业企业中普遍推广。据6月30日止统计，全市已有四十四个单位采用土法炼出了钢水。
    据新华社讯　广西僮族自治区炼出了第一批钢。6月23日，梧州糖厂新办的炼钢厂首先炼出第一炉钢。接着，梧州船舶厂新办的冶炼厂也连续试炼出了三炉钢。这些钢都是高炭钢，经过技术鉴定，质量良好。
    梧州糖厂的先进生产者伍庆淞和几个老技工，带着三十多个工人一起动手，经过十五个多小时的苦战，做成了鼓风机和其他设备，然后将坩埚放在炉子上，四周用焦炭围烧，熔出铁水，再用鼓风机鼓风和送氧，约三小时就炼出了四十斤钢。梧州船舶厂的冶炼厂在试炼中曾经失败过两次，职工们鼓足干劲，用冲天炉熔出来的铁水，放进自制的贝氏小转炉内，用鼓风机送空气，约十分钟即炼出钢来。
    据新华社讯　甘肃有四个工厂在最近先后用土办法炼出了钢。这四个工厂是天水农具厂，临洮机械制配厂，兰州石油化工机器厂和兰州面粉厂。
    这些厂的炼钢法比较简单，但是炼出的钢质量并不差。临洮机械制配厂采取土办法，把废生铁、铝、废钢、毛铁等按一定的比例放进坩埚，用手摇吹风机吹风，三十五分钟以后便炼出了钢。据有经验的老工人谈，这种钢的质量介乎中炭钢和高炭钢之间，硬度很强。在第一炉冶炼成功后，当天晚上他们还炼出了一炉锰合金钢。兰州石油化工机器厂在22日用手抬小铁水包炼出了第一炉钢，经过仪器化验是用途很广的中炭钢。
    据新华社讯　西宁新生铁工厂在没有设备、缺乏经验和技术的情况下，在6月30日试炼出第一炉合乎标准的高炭钢。
    这个厂过去是一个生产小型机械和修配的工厂，职工们从未想到过炼钢的事情。在总路线鼓舞下，他们决心要炼出钢来。没有炼钢用的炉子，就用铁皮和旧设备来制造；缺乏炼钢经验和知识，就找来一些有关书籍，边研究、边学习、边试验。经过十一次试验，才使钢的含炭量和含硫量合乎要求。
    据新华社讯　国营西安机械厂锻铸车间职工用废铁包改装成转炉，6月30日晚上炼出了第一炉钢。
    6月28日开始，职工们分工担任绘草图、做模型、找资料、砌炉子、找材料、挖坑等工作，边干边摸索。他们找废铁包来制造炉体，找普通耐火材料石英砂来代替矽砖；没有鼓风机，就用一个铁管子带上马达，以压缩空气来代替。就这样连续奋战三十三小时，没有花一个钱就把转炉砌成了。
    初步计算，这个炉子每年可产钢两千吨。这样的炉子有炼铁高炉的地方都可以兴办。（附图片）
