Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 12th. The first trolleybus line in the Northwest region opened on the 10th. It was built by the people of Tianshui City, Gansu Province, using substitutes and old equipment. This line, which connects urban and rural areas, is thirty kilometers long. The first section, which opened on the 10th, is more than two kilometers long.

The vast rural areas around Tianshui City are undergoing various construction projects, and the original means of transportation can no longer meet the needs of connecting urban and rural areas. After hearing the news that the rural areas of Weiyuan County had built earthen railways, the people of Tianshui City decided to pool their wisdom and efforts and rely on their own strength to build trolleybus lines. They used iron wire instead of copper wire to build overhead lines; automobile repair workers used old generators and old car bodies to make beautiful trolleybuses; and thousands of street residents, government cadres, farmers, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army also worked hard day and night to pave the roads for the trolleybuses.

This trolleybus route starts from Tianshui City, passes through most of the rural areas, and finally reaches Beidao埠 Town in Tianshui County. The entire line is expected to open on National Day. Some people who came from other places to visit believe that Tianshui City's experience provides an example for the whole people to run modern transportation, and they are preparing to promote this experience when they return.

### 全民办现代化交通事业的又一范例  天水出现城乡无轨电车

    全民办现代化交通事业的又一范例
    天水出现城乡无轨电车
    新华社兰州12日电　西北地区第一条无轨电车线路在10日通车。它是甘肃省天水市人民利用代用品和旧器材修筑起来的。这条沟通城乡的线路全长三十公里，10日先行通车的一段有两公里多长。
    天水市四周广大农村正在进行各项建设工作，原有的交通工具已不能满足沟通城乡的需要。天水市人民在听到渭源县农村修成土铁路的消息以后，决定群策群力，依靠本身力量修建无轨电车线路。他们用铁线代替铜线，修起了架空线路；汽车修理工人利用旧发电机和旧汽车车身制成了漂亮的电车；数千个街道居民、机关干部、农民和解放军官兵，也日夜苦战，为电车铺平了道路。
    这条电车路以天水市为起点，大部分通行在农村中，最后到达天水县的北道埠镇，全线预计在国庆节通车。有些从外地前来参观的人们认为，天水市的经验为全民办现代化交通事业提供了一个范例，他们回去准备推广这一经验。
