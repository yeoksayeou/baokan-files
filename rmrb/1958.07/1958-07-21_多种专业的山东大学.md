On the coast of Jiaozhou Bay, there is a beautiful city - Qingdao. Shandong University is located in the most beautiful and tranquil area of this city.

Shandong University is a relatively complete comprehensive university that trains talents for scientific research institutions, production departments, and higher and secondary schools. It currently has eight departments and nine specialties: Chinese Language and Literature, History, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology (Animal and Plant Specialties), Oceanography, and Fisheries. Among these specialties, specialization and scientific research work are being developed in subjects such as ocean hydrology, ocean meteorology, marine chemistry, marine biology, freshwater aquaculture, as well as underwater acoustics, atomic physics, magnetism, differential equations, and special functions, according to construction needs and the characteristics of the university. The university currently has 2,238 students and will expand to approximately 3,000 students this summer. There are 382 teachers. The Department of Geology is being actively prepared and is planned to enroll students this summer. In addition to the existing aquaculture specialty in the Department of Fisheries, the original fishing and processing specialties are also planned to re-enroll students next summer.

Shandong University was established in 1926. After liberation, under the leadership and care of the Party, the number of teachers and students has increased more than four times in recent years. New books and new instruments and equipment are also increasing with the development of teaching. At present, each department has laboratories and libraries suitable for its own specialty. The work-study factories run by students of each department include a radio instrument factory, a mechanical processing factory, and a marine plant fertilizer factory. Shandong University has begun to carry out teaching reforms. It has recently been decided to implement a system of one month of vacation, two months of labor, and nine months of classes each year. Students from each department will also carry out work-study activities in conjunction with their specialties.

    在胶州湾的海岸上，有一座美丽的城市——青岛，山东大学就座落在这座城市最秀丽、最幽静的区域里。
    山东大学是一所为科学研究机关、生产部门、高等和中等学校培养人材的较完整的综合性大学。现有中国语言文学、历史、数学、物理、化学、生物（动物专业和植物专业）、海洋、水产八个系，九个专业。在这些专业当中，正在根据建设需要和学校特点，发展海洋水文、海洋气象、海洋化学、海洋生物、淡水养殖以及水声学、原子物理、磁学、微分方程、特殊函数等科目的专门化和科学研究工作。全校现有学生二千二百三十八人，今年暑期将扩大至三千人左右，教师三百八十二人。现正在积极筹备的地质系，计划在今年暑期招生，水产系除现有一个养殖专业外，原有的渔捞、加工两专业，也计划在明年暑期重新招生。
    山东大学是1926年建立的，解放后，在党的领导和关怀下，几年来，师生人数增添了四倍多，新图书、新仪器设备也在随着教学的发展日益增添，目前各系都有适合自己专业的实验室和图书室。各系学生自办的勤工俭学工厂，有无线电仪器厂、机械加工厂、海洋植物肥料厂。山东大学开始进行教学改革。最近已确定今后实行每年一个月假期，两个月劳动，九个月上课，各系学生还将结合自己的专业进行勤工俭学的活动。
