    A Good Way to Raise Cattle—Dual-Purpose for Draught and Milk
    Jiangsu Experience Proves This Method Can Promote Cattle
    Breeding, Increase Cattle Utilization Rate and Economic Value
    This newspaper reports that making existing cattle both work in the fields and produce milk has been put on the agenda in Jiangsu Province.
    Jiangsu Province currently has 1.9 million head of cattle, including 1 million cows. In order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, Jiangsu Province proposed a plan this spring to "double in three years and reach five million in five years" for breeding cattle. At the same time, according to investigation and analysis, a head of cattle only spends two or three months of the year doing heavy farm work such as plowing, and the rest of the time doing light work, and even three or four months of the year with no work at all. Developing dual-purpose draught and milk cattle will greatly promote cattle breeding, increase the utilization rate and economic value of cattle, and further improve people's lives.
    According to local experience, pregnancy does not affect the use of cows for draught. Because cows are in heat all year round, once every three to four weeks, in order not to affect production, mating can be carried out in batches in a planned way according to the local farm work needs for cattle. The gestation period of a cow is about nine and a half months. The first seven months are a light burden period, because the fetus is not large and has no effect on labor; after seven months is the heavy burden period, and proper care should be taken when using it. According to the experience of Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative and Longgang Agricultural Cooperative in Xuyi County, using the method of "working diligently and resting diligently," pregnant cows not only do not affect labor during the heavy burden period, but can also give birth a week earlier.
    Chuansha County, Jiangsu Province, has a history of more than 60 years in developing dual-purpose draught and milk cattle. It now has more than 2,300 head of dual-purpose draught and milk cattle, and 20% of agricultural cooperatives have established collective pastures.
    Huangxu Ranch in Siyang County has been promoting the breeding of local cattle with purebred dairy bulls in rural areas for the past five years, producing more than 1,500 dual-purpose draught and milk cattle, which are very popular among farmers. The North Jiangsu Agricultural College has also conducted research on the milk production of hybrid cattle. From the experience already gained by these units, developing dual-purpose draught and milk cattle has five major benefits for the country, collectives, and individuals. First, developing dual-purpose draught and milk cattle will greatly promote cattle breeding. Second, the pulling power of this hybrid cattle is the same as that of local yellow cattle, and the milk production is very high. Third, it increases the economic value of cattle and increases the economic income of agricultural cooperatives and farmers. Gu Dong Agricultural Cooperative in Chuansha County raised 56 dual-purpose draught and milk cattle. Last year, excluding the income from six calves, the income from milk alone accounted for 30% of the total income from agricultural and sideline businesses. The milk production period of the first-generation hybrid dual-purpose draught and milk cattle is generally six to eight months, with an average daily milk production of about 15 jin, totaling 2,700 to 3,600 jin. Calculated at 0.2 yuan per jin, the total is 540 yuan to 720 yuan. Fourth, the development of dual-purpose draught and milk cattle provides a large amount of raw materials for local industry, especially the food industry. Siyang County plans to build four new milk processing plants during the second Five-Year Plan period, and the province will build 415 medium and small dairy processing plants during the same period. Fifth, it promotes the improvement of cattle feeding management.
    In order to realize the plan for developing dual-purpose draught and milk cattle, the agricultural departments of Jiangsu Province have taken a series of measures based on the practical experience already gained in Chuansha and Siyang counties. The province currently has 17 dairy farms, producing 400 to 500 purebred Dutch bull calves annually. All of them will be retained from now on to mate with local cows, and cultivate new breeds of cattle that are adaptable, high in milk production, and capable of engaging in labor. At the same time, artificial insemination stations will be established in every township, so that purebred bulls can mate with more local cows to expand the mating area. From 1959, all of the province's more than 30,000 agricultural cooperatives will establish dairy bull breeding stations in every cooperative. In areas where there are currently no purebred bulls, "native breeding" will be used first to improve feeding management and increase milk production.

    养牛的好方法——役乳两用
    江苏经验证明：这方法能促进耕牛
    繁殖，提高耕牛利用率和经济价值
    本报讯　使现有的耕牛既能作耕又能产乳，在江苏省已被提到行动日程上来了。
    江苏省现有耕牛一百九十万头，其中母牛有一百万头。为了适应农业生产大跃进的需要，江苏省在今春就提出了“三年翻一番，五年五百万”的繁殖耕牛的规划。同时，根据调查分析，一头耕牛在一年时间内从事耕田等重农活的时间只有二、三个月，其余时间都干的轻活，甚至还有三、四个月的时间是没有活干。发展役乳两用牛的措施，将大大促进耕牛的繁殖，提高耕牛的利用率和经济价值，进一步改善人民生活。
    根据各地经验，母牛怀胎期并不影响使役。因为母牛是常年发情的，每三到四个星期就发情一次，为了不影响生产，可以根据当地农活对耕牛的需要情况，有计划地分批地进行配种。母牛怀胎期约九个半月，前七个月是轻窝期，因为胎儿不大，对劳役没有影响；七个月后是重窝期，在使用时要适当的加以照顾。根据盱眙县新华农业社和龙岗农业社的经验，采用“勤用勤歇”的办法，怀胎母牛不但在重窝期间不影响劳役，而且产期还能提前一个星期。
    江苏省川沙县发展役乳两用牛已有六十多年的历史，现有役乳两用牛二千三百多头，已有20％的农业社建立了集体牧场。
    泗阳县黄圩牧场，五年来已在农村中推广乳用纯种公牛与本地牛配种，生产了一千五百余头役乳两用牛，很受农民们的欢迎。苏北农学院也进行了杂交牛产乳量的研究。从这些单位已经取得的经验来看，发展役乳两用牛对国家、集体和个人有五大好处。第一，发展役乳两用牛，将大大促进耕牛的繁殖。第二，这种杂交牛的拉力跟当地黄牛一样，产乳量很高。第三，提高了耕牛的经济价值，增加了农业社和农民的经济收入。川沙县顾东农业社一社，饲养了五十六头役乳两用牛，去年，不包括六头小牛的收益在内，单在牛乳方面的收入，就占农副业总收入的30％。杂交一代的役乳两用牛，产乳期一般为六至八个月，平均每日产乳量十五斤左右，计产乳二千七百到三千六百斤。以每斤二角钱计算，共为五百四十元到七百二十元。第四，役乳两用牛的发展，为地方工业特别是食品工业提供了大量的原料。泗阳县计划在第二个五年计划期间新建四个牛奶加工厂，在同期内全省将新建四百十五个中、小型乳品加工厂。第五、促进耕牛饲养管理的提高。
    为了实现发展役乳两用牛的规划，根据川沙、泗阳两县已经取得的实践的经验，江苏省的农业部门已采取了一系列的措施。全省现有十七个乳牛场，年产四百到五百头荷兰纯种小公牛，从现在起全部保留，以便和本地母牛交配，培养成为适应性强、产乳量高、又能从事劳役的新的良种牛。同时，乡乡建立人工授精站，使纯种公牛能配更多的本地母牛，以扩大配种面。全省三万多个农业社，从1959年起，将社社建立乳公牛配种站。在目前尚无纯种公牛的地区，先用“土种交配”，改善饲养管理，提高产乳量。
