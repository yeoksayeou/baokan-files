    Late Night in Beirut
    Fang Shu

    Beirut, July 24 (Agence France-Presse) – “The Marines guarding the American beachhead near Beirut spent their first quiet night last night since their arrival in Lebanon on July 15…” This implies that all the other nights were not quiet.

    Night. John is on guard at Beirut International Airport. He paces back and forth anxiously, sometimes lost in thought, sometimes listening intently to the fierce gunfire coming from the areas controlled by the Lebanese insurgents.

    The Arabian night is nothing like the beautiful scene depicted in myths, it’s dark everywhere, like a bottomless abyss.
    “Ah!” After a burst of gunfire, John sighed deeply. An old question, for which he hadn’t found an answer, surfaced in his mind again: "What are we doing being sent to this distant Middle East?" Although the President had told them that this was to "help the Lebanese people maintain their freedom," John still had some doubts. Otherwise, why would the Lebanese people treat them so unfriendly? Lebanese children sent Coca-Cola laced with time bombs, and Marines had their fingers blown off while heating up rations… The more John thought about it, the more afraid he became. He felt as if the people of Lebanon had surrounded him from all sides. He suddenly raised his gun and looked around. Thank God, there was nothing, it was still dark everywhere. John put his gun back on his shoulder and started walking again. To avoid his own footsteps startling him, he walked more lightly this time.

    After a while, his thoughts flew away again. He seemed to be back in his hometown, seeing his gray-haired mother, his charming Maria, and his crippled brother. Years ago, his brother went to the Korean War to pursue a dark-haired, dark-eyed oriental beauty. When he returned, he had lost both legs, and now he could only walk with two wooden crutches! Thinking of this, John unconsciously touched his own legs. Fortunately, his legs were still there, not separated from his body. He breathed a sigh of relief and prayed softly.

    A burst of rapid gunfire startled him. He raised his head in panic and looked around. How wonderful it would be if nothing happened tonight! But, at this moment, he vaguely saw a dark figure swaying in the distance. With trembling hands, he took down his gun to prepare to shoot, but when he looked again, there was nothing. "My eyes are playing tricks on me, it's the wind blowing the branches!" John rubbed his eyelids hard, comforting himself. He restrained the panic in his heart, deliberately tilted his head to one side, and didn't look there. "But, what if it really is a person, a Lebanese insurgent?" John's heart beat violently, and he had to turn his head. Ah! It really was a person, he could see clearly this time: he was walking slowly, as if afraid of disturbing John. He was also holding something in his hand, was it a pistol or a bayonet?

    "Who is it? Stop, password!" John shouted in a jumbled manner, trying to use his voice to embolden himself.

    The person didn't answer and kept walking forward. Suddenly, there was a "bang." "What! What! I'm done, he threw a grenade at me…" John didn't have time to think and raised his gun and started shooting rapidly. Finally, the person fell!

    John, with a grin on his face, wiped the sweat from his forehead and ran towards the person.

    "My God, isn't this Thomas?" John exclaimed. This unlucky drunkard, who knows where he went to get drunk again. His face, wounded by gunfire, still reeked of alcohol, and the pool of blood he was shedding contained the fragments of broken liquor bottles.

    John's whole body went limp, and he fell to the side of Thomas, his heart beating even faster!

    Around him, it was still the dark Arabian night. (Attached picture)

### 贝鲁特的深夜

    贝鲁特的深夜
    方曙
    据法新社24日贝鲁特电：“守卫在贝鲁特附近美国滩头阵地的海军陆战队自从他们7月15日到达黎巴嫩以来昨晚第一次度过一个安静的夜晚……”这就是说，除了这一夜，其余都是不安静的。
    夜。约翰正在贝鲁特国际机场站岗。他焦燥不安地来回走动着，一会儿陷入沉思，一会儿又竖起耳朵来听那猛烈的射击声，那是从黎巴嫩起义者控制地区传出来的。
    阿拉伯的夜，一点也不像神话里描写的那么美，到处黑沉沉的，就像个无底深渊。
      “唉！”一阵枪声过后，约翰长长地叹了一口气，一个一直没有找到答案的老问题又浮上他的心头：“把我们送到这遥远的中东来，是为了什么呢？”虽然总统已经告诉过他们，这是为了“援助黎巴嫩人民保持自由”；但是约翰总还是有点怀疑，不然，黎巴嫩人民为什么会对他们采取这样不友好的态度呢：黎巴嫩小孩送来的可口可乐装了定时炸弹，海军陆战队在热口粮时被炸去了手指……约翰越想越害怕，他好像觉得，黎巴嫩的人民已经从四面把他团团包围起来。他猛然举起枪来，四周环顾了一遍。感谢上帝，什么都没有，到处仍旧是黑沉沉的。约翰重新把枪背在背上，又走动起来。为了免得自己的脚步声惊扰自己，他这次走得轻一些了。
    一会儿，他的思想又飞走了。他似乎回到了自己的家乡，看到了白发苍苍的母亲，看到了娇媚的玛丽亚，看到了残废了的哥哥。几年前，哥哥为了追寻黑发黑睛的东方美人去到朝鲜战场上，回来时，他却失去了双腿，现在他只能支着两只木架走路了！想到这里，约翰不自觉地用手摸了一下自己的腿，还好，自己的腿还在，还没有和身体分离，他放心地嘘了口气，低低地祈祷起来。
    一阵急骤的枪声使他惊醒过来。他慌乱地抬起头来东张西望，今夜不发生什么意外多好啊！但是，就在这时候，他恍惚看到远处有一个黑影在晃动。他用颤抖的手取下枪来准备射击，可是一看却什么也没有了。“我的眼睛花了，那是风刮动了树枝哩！”约翰用手死劲揉了揉眼皮，安慰自己。他克制着内心的慌乱，故意把头歪到一边去，不看那儿。“但是，万一那真是一个人，是一个黎巴嫩起义者呢？”约翰的心猛烈地跳了起来，他不得不转过头去。啊！真是一个人，这回看得清清楚楚了：他慢慢地走着，像怕惊动了约翰一样。手里还拿着什么，是手枪，还是刺刀？
    “是什么人？站住，口令！”约翰叽叽哇哇地叫了起来，他想用声音来给自己壮壮胆子。
    那个人没有答复，还在往前走。突然“碰”的一声响了。“什么！什么！我完了，他向我投手榴弹……”约翰来不及再思索，端起枪便噼噼啪啪地射了起来。终于，那个人倒下去了！
    约翰脸上带着狞笑，擦了一把头上的汗，便朝着那个人跑去了。
      “我的上帝呀，这不是汤姆斯吗？”约翰惊叫起来。这个倒霉的酒鬼，不知又闯到哪儿去喝醉了。他带着枪伤的脸上还冒着酒气，他流出的一大滩血里还有着被碰碎了的酒瓶的残滓。
    约翰浑身都软了，他一屁股摔在汤姆斯的旁边，心跳得更响了！
    在他的周围，仍旧是黑沉沉的阿拉伯的夜。（附图片）
