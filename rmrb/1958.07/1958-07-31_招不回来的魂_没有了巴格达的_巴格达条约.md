　　The Baghdad Pact group, without Baghdad, held a two-day council meeting in London, five thousand kilometers away from Baghdad, starting on July 28. The master of this meeting was the American observer Dulles, who came from even further away than Baghdad, separated from Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan by an ocean and a continent on the other side of the earth. This meeting was full of Americans, British, and the lackeys of Americans and British, lacking only the participation of representatives of the Middle Eastern people, while its task was precisely to oppose the Middle Eastern people, first and foremost to oppose the namesake of this treaty, Baghdad – the Republic of Iraq.
　　The Baghdad Pact group was an aggressive tool cobbled together by the US and Britain in the Middle East in 1955 and manipulated behind the scenes by the United States. This group waved the bankrupt banner of opposing "communist infiltration," but what it did was suppress the national independence movements in the Middle East and split the unity of Arab countries, and it set up a source of war in the Middle East that threatened peace. In the early days of this group's formation, the Soviet government pointed out incisively: "The conclusion of the Baghdad Pact means the establishment of a military group in the Near and Middle East, and this military group is a tool of some aggressive group that does not care about strengthening peace and international security. Another purpose of establishing such a group is to maintain and restore the colonial dependence of countries in the region." Egyptian President Nasser believed that "the Baghdad Pact is a large prison for the people of Arab countries." Indian Prime Minister Nehru also said: "The Baghdad Pact has in fact created unprecedented and more serious tensions and hostility in the West Asian region." The Baghdad Pact group has always played this extremely reactionary role under the direction of the US and Britain. In April 1957, when the United States instigated a coup to subvert the nationalist government of Jordan, Turkey and the former Iraqi reactionary government deployed troops on the borders of Jordan and Syria, respectively, to threaten them; in August of the same year, when the United States' conspiracy to subvert the national independence government of Syria was exposed, Turkey and the former Iraqi reactionary government again gathered troops on the Syrian border, attempting to attack. After the victory of the Iraqi revolution, the new government of the Republic of Iraq took control of the secret documents of the Baghdad Pact group, including the invasion plans proposed by the United States, the joint military plans of the countries participating in this group, and the list of special agents and spies deployed by the so-called "Anti-Subversion Committee" affiliated to this group. According to the Syrian "Victory Daily," the Baghdad Pact group, under the command of US and British imperialism, engaged in so many unspeakable and despicable activities that the countries concerned had to beg the new Iraqi government not to publish these documents.
　　The aggressive activities carried out by US and British imperialism using the Baghdad Pact group naturally aroused strong opposition from the people of the Middle East. The people of the Middle East regard this aggressive group as their mortal enemy. The Iraqi people's revolution was a direct blow to the Baghdad Pact group. The Nuri al-Said regime was originally the cornerstone of the Baghdad Pact group, a reliable tool of imperialism in the Arab East. The rapid demise of this regime under the unanimous hatred of the people of the whole country shows how much the people hate the agents of imperialism and the aggressive tools of imperialism. However, US and British imperialism did not learn a lesson from this event. On the contrary, they openly carried out the most vicious armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan with the aim of subverting the Republic of Iraq, and they also tried their best to prop up the already bankrupt Baghdad Pact group so that it could continue to serve as a tool for their adventurous policies. Under the direction of US and British imperialism, Turkey, a member of the Baghdad group, has already sent troops to the borders of Iraq and the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic. In addition, Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu openly declared that once the puppet King Hussein of Jordan starts to march towards Iraq, Turkey will send volunteer troops to participate in the war. At the London meeting, Dulles, who had always been cautiously issuing orders to this group behind the scenes, openly guaranteed that the United States would immediately conclude bilateral "security and defense" agreements with the remaining member states of this group separately. The United Press International pointed out in its report that the United States is actually undertaking the same military obligations as direct participation in the treaty. Under the command of Dulles, the remaining member states of the Baghdad Pact group conducted a so-called "collective security arrangement" at the London meeting, put forward a "joint military plan," and expressed their intention to further strengthen the "unified defense position" in the Middle East. It is very clear that all these actions of the US and British imperialist group are to further expand their aggressive activities in the Middle East.
　　At the London meeting, Dulles described the aggression of US and British imperialism against the Middle East as being for the purpose of "stopping" the "continued development of Nasser's ambitions"; and also attacked the Soviet Union for "supporting Nasser" in an attempt to "gain a dominant position in that region," while "the United States does not want the Soviet Union to gain a special position in the Middle East." Dulles' shameless slander precisely shows that US imperialism is the number one enemy of the people of the Middle East and the security of the Middle East. The Arab people and the entire Middle Eastern people demand national independence, which is their sacred right. What kind of "ambition" is this? Why is it called "ambition" for the Arab people to gain a dominant position in the Arab countries, and why is it called a "privilege" for the Soviet Union, which has about three thousand kilometers of common border with the Middle Eastern countries, to care about the security of its borders, while the Anglo-Saxons who are far away in the sky move their naval, land, and air forces to the Arab countries to run rampant, and unscrupulously mobilize the heads of three Asian countries to gather on the islands in northwestern Europe to instigate them to oppose their neighbors, but it is not called "ambition," not called "privilege"?
　　The imperialist jackals are never satisfied. There is no problem with Westerners doing oil business with Easterners. The problem is that they want to rob, they want to suck the oil of Easterners dry, and they also want to shed the blood of Easterners. But the era they dreamed of is gone forever. The Baghdad Pact, which has never been recognized and supported by the people of the East, is now dismembered and has become the Baghdad Pact without Baghdad and against Baghdad. Let Dulles and his ilk summon its soul! The Middle East is full of oil, and the Middle East is full of tinder. You can let the Baghdad Pact move, and the people of the Middle East can also let the Iraqi revolution move. The fate of Nuri al-Said symbolizes the fate of the Baghdad Pact: whoever wants to replace Said's position, whoever awaits Said's end!

### 招不回来的魂——没有了巴格达的“巴格达条约”

    招不回来的魂——没有了巴格达的“巴格达条约”
    没有了巴格达的巴格达条约集团，从7月28日起在距离巴格达五千公里以外的伦敦举行了两天的理事会会议。这个会议的主宰是离开巴格达更远的、同土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦隔了一个洋又一个洲的地球另一面的美国客人观察员杜勒斯。这个会议上有的是美国人、英国人和美国人英国人的走狗，仅仅缺少中东人民的代表参加，而它的任务却正是反对中东人民，首先是反对这个条约的命名地巴格达——伊拉克共和国。
    巴格达条约集团是在1955年由美英在中东拼凑起来而由美国在幕后操纵的侵略性工具。这个集团打的所谓反对“共产主义渗透”的早已破产了的旗帜，干的却是镇压中东民族独立运动和分裂阿拉伯国家的团结的勾当，并且在中东设下了威胁和平的一个战争策源地。在这个集团形成初期，苏联政府就一针见血地指出：“巴格达条约的缔结，意味着在中近东建立军事集团，而这个军事集团是不关心加强和平和国际安全的某个侵略集团的工具。建立这种集团的另一个目的，是要维持和恢复这个地区的国家的殖民地依赖地位。”埃及总统纳赛尔认为“巴格达条约是阿拉伯各国人民的大监狱”。印度总理尼赫鲁也说：“巴格达条约事实上在西亚地区造成了前所未有的更加严重的紧张局势和敌对。”巴格达条约集团一直就是在美英指使之下起这种极端反动的作用的。1957年4月，当美国策动政变颠覆约旦民族主义政府的时候，土耳其和前伊拉克反动政府分别陈兵约旦和叙利亚边境，进行威胁；同年8月，当美国颠覆叙利亚民族独立政府的阴谋被揭露的时候，土耳其和前伊拉克反动政府又在叙利亚边境集结军队，企图进攻。伊拉克革命胜利以后，伊拉克共和国新政府掌握了巴格达条约集团的秘密文件，包括美国所提出的侵略方案、参加这个集团的国家的联合军事计划以及这个集团所属的所谓“反颠覆委员会”所布置的特务间谍的名单。据叙利亚“胜利报”揭露，巴格达条约集团在美英帝国主义指挥下干了这么多的不可见人的卑鄙活动，以至有关的国家不得不央求伊拉克新政府不要公布这些文件。
    美英帝国主义利用巴格达条约集团进行的侵略活动，自然不能不引起了中东人民的强烈反对。中东人民把这个侵略集团看作是他们的一个死敌。伊拉克人民革命是对巴格达条约集团的一个直接打击。努里·赛义德政权原来是巴格达条约集团的基石，帝国主义在阿拉伯东方的可靠的工具。这个政权在全国人民一致痛恨的情况下迅速灭亡，说明了人民是多么仇恨帝国主义的代理人和帝国主义的侵略工具。但是，美英帝国主义并没有在这个事件中取得教训，相反的，它们公然以颠覆伊拉克共和国为目的而在黎巴嫩和约旦实行最凶恶的武装干涉，并且还竭力要把已经破了产的巴格达条约集团支撑起来，使它继续充当它们的冒险政策的工具。在美英帝国主义的指使下，巴格达集团的成员国土耳其已经把军队开向伊拉克和阿联的叙利亚地区的边境。此外，土耳其外长佐鲁公然扬言，在约旦傀儡国王侯赛因一旦开始向伊拉克进军时，土耳其将派志愿军参加作战。在伦敦会议上，一向蹑手蹑脚地在幕后对这个集团发号施令的杜勒斯，公开保证美国将立即与这个集团的残存的成员国分别缔结“安全和防御”的双边协定。美国合众国际社在报道中指出，这样美国实际上等于承担了与直接参加条约一样的军事义务。在杜勒斯的指挥下，巴格达条约集团残存的成员国在伦敦会议上进行了所谓“集体安全安排”，提出了一个“联合军事计划”，并表示要进一步加强在中东地区的“统一防御地位”。事情很明显，美英帝国主义集团的这一切做法是为了进一步扩大它们在中东的侵略活动。
    杜勒斯在伦敦会议上把美英帝国主义对中东的侵略说成是为了“制止”“纳赛尔野心的继续发展”；并且还攻击苏联“支持纳赛尔”是想在“那个地区取得支配地位”，而“美国不想让苏联在中东取得特别的地位”。杜勒斯的这种无耻污蔑恰恰表示美帝国主义是中东人民和中东安全的头号公敌。阿拉伯人民和整个中东人民要求民族独立，乃是他们的神圣权利，这算什么“野心”？为什么阿拉伯人民要在阿拉伯国家取得支配地位叫作“野心”，为什么同中东各国有大约三千公里共同边境的苏联关心它国境的安全叫作“特权”，而远在天边的盎格鲁撒克逊人把自己的海陆空军搬到阿拉伯国家来横行霸道，又把三个亚洲国家的首脑调集到欧洲西北的海岛上开会，肆无忌惮地策动他们反对自己的邻国，反而不叫“野心”，不叫“特权”？
    帝国主义的豺狼是永远不知道满足的。西方人要同东方人作石油的买卖，这没有问题。问题是他们要抢劫，他们要吸干东方人的油，还要流完东方人的血。但是他们所梦想的时代已经一去不复返了。从来没有得到过东方人承认和支持的巴格达条约，现在已经身首异处，成为没有巴格达和反对巴格达的巴格达条约了。让杜勒斯之流替它招魂去吧！中东到处是石油，中东到处是引火物。你可以让巴格达条约搬家，中东人民也可以让伊拉克革命搬家。努里·赛义德的命运象征了巴格达条约的命运：谁要代替赛义德的地位，谁就等待着赛义德的下场！
