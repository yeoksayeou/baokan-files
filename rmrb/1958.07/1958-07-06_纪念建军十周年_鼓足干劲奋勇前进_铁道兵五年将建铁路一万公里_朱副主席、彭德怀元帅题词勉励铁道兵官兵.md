Xinhua News Agency, July 5th. Officers and soldiers of the leadership organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Engineering Corps gathered today to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the army's founding. Li Shouxuan, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Railway Engineering Corps, announced at the celebration that during the Second Five-Year Plan, the Railway Engineering Corps would build 10,000 kilometers of railways for the country and achieve complete self-sufficiency in military expenditures.

Lieutenant General Li Shouxuan said that ten years ago today, the Railway Engineering Corps was established in Harbin, Northeast China. The Railway Engineering Corps was established following the military line and army-building principles formulated by Chairman Mao. Over the past ten years, after undergoing the test of war and participating in the construction of the motherland's railways, the troops' political awareness, military skills, and railway construction capabilities have greatly improved. A large number of technical personnel have been trained, experience in wartime repair and peacetime railway construction has been accumulated, and many new and complex railway technologies and construction methods have been mastered.

After recounting the experiences of the Railway Engineering Corps over the past ten years, Lieutenant General Li Shouxuan said that the path the Railway Engineering Corps has taken over the past ten years is a glorious path of heroic struggle and arduous labor. As we look back on the past, we should further consolidate and carry forward our glorious traditions.

He continued, saying that in order to implement the resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the Party Committee of the Railway Engineering Corps put forward the call to the troops to "Leap forward again and again, double and redouble, comprehensively implement the General Line, and build railways in a vigorous manner." We originally planned to build 5,000 kilometers of roads in the Second Five-Year Plan, but now we have raised it to 10,000 kilometers to meet the needs of the great development of industry and agricultural production in our country.

Lieutenant General Li Shouxuan said that, according to the new road construction tasks, the Party Committee of the Railway Engineering Corps proposed that the Railway Engineering Corps should fully realize mechanization within five years. At present, machinery should be gradually used extensively in bridge and tunnel construction and lifting engineering to replace heavy physical labor. In roadbed earthwork and stonework engineering, large-scale earthwork machinery should be used as a priority, and small machinery should be vigorously promoted, and labor tools and transportation tools should be improved to strive to eliminate the use of earth baskets and carrying poles in the shortest possible time, so as to greatly improve labor efficiency and accelerate the speed of railway construction.

Lieutenant General Li Shouxuan concluded by saying that under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line and inspired by the grand plan for the motherland's railway construction, we must bravely advance, strive to complete the railway construction tasks assigned to us by the state and the people, and ensure that we achieve complete self-sufficiency in military expenditures.

At the meeting, the leading organs of the Railway Engineering Corps received a congratulatory telegram from Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways.

Xinhua News Agency, July 5th. Today, the "Railway Engineering Corps News" published a special issue celebrating the tenth anniversary of the army's founding, featuring inscriptions by Vice Chairman Zhu De, Marshal Peng Dehuai, and General Tan Zheng, as well as an article written by Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways.

Vice Chairman Zhu De's inscription for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Railway Engineering Corps is: "Exert full effort, strive for the upper reaches, and build railways in a faster, better, and more economical way!"

Defense Minister Marshal Peng Dehuai's inscription is: "Dear Comrades of the Railway Engineering Corps: Over the past ten years, you have overcome various difficulties, built many railways, accelerated the country's industrialization, and strengthened national defense construction. It is hoped that you will continue to exert full effort, strive for the upper reaches, and build more, longer, and better railways with the revolutionary spirit of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army will be grateful to you. Comrades, theory comes from practice, and technology comes from labor. This is the truth. As long as you have the spirit to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and seriously sum up experience, you can develop theory and improve technology. Comrades, please remember Chairman Mao's words that modesty makes one progress, and pride makes one fall behind. Progress and backwardness, pride and modesty, not only exist in the past and present, but will always exist in the future. People who do not want to fall behind should never be proud."

In his article for the special issue, Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways, said that the Railway Engineering Corps was born in arduous battles, grew in successive victories, and became stronger in the country's construction. They are both a fighting force and a construction force. Under the situation of a great leap forward in national production, they will, together with railway workers and the people participating in road construction across the country, complete the leap forward plan for new railway construction across the country in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way.

    纪念建军十周年　鼓足干劲奋勇前进
    铁道兵五年将建铁路一万公里
    朱副主席、彭德怀元帅题词勉励铁道兵官兵
    新华社5日讯　中国人民解放军铁道兵领导机关官兵今天集会庆祝建军十周年。铁道兵司令员李寿轩中将在庆祝会上宣布，在第二个五年计划中，铁道兵要为国家修建一万公里铁路，并且要做到全部军费自给。
    李寿轩中将说，十年前的今天，铁道兵在东北哈尔滨成立。铁道兵是遵循着毛主席制定的军事路线和建军原则建立起来的。十年来，经过了战争的考验和参加祖国铁路建设的锻炼，部队的政治觉悟，军事素养，修建铁路的本领，都有了很大的提高，并且培养了大批技术人员，积累了战时抢修与和平时期修建铁路的经验，掌握了许多新的复杂的铁路技术和施工方法。
    李寿轩中将叙述了铁道兵十年来的经历以后说，铁道兵十年来走过的道路，是英勇奋战、艰苦劳动的光荣道路。当我们回顾过去的时候，我们应当将我们的光荣传统进一步巩固和发扬下去。
    他接着说，铁道兵党委为了贯彻执行党的八大二次会议的决议，向部队提出了“跃进再跃进，番上又加番，全面贯彻总路线，轰轰烈烈修铁路”的号召。我们原定第二个五年计划中修路五千公里的指标，现在提高到一万公里，以适应我国工、农业生产大发展的需要。
    李寿轩中将说，根据新的修路任务，铁道兵党委提出：铁道兵要在五年以内全部实现机械化。当前，要逐渐在桥梁隧道施工和起重工程方面，大量使用机械来代替笨重的体力劳动；在路基土石方工程方面，重点地使用大型土方机械，并大力推广小型机械，改良劳动工具、运输工具，争取在最短的时间内不再使用土篮子和扁担，以大大提高劳动效率，加快建设铁路的速度。
    李寿轩中将最后说，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在祖国铁路建设宏伟规划的鼓舞下，我们要奋勇前进，努力完成国家和人民交给我们的铁路建设任务，并保证做到全部军费自给。
    会上，铁道兵领导机关接到了铁道部部长滕代远的贺电。
    新华社5日讯　今天，铁道兵报出版了庆祝建军十周年专刊，登载了朱德副主席、彭德怀元帅和谭政大将的题词，铁道部滕代远部长写的文章。
    朱德副主席为铁道兵建军十周年题的词是：“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设铁路！”
  国防部长彭德怀元帅的题词是：“亲爱的铁道兵全体同志：十年来你们克服了各种困难，修建了很多铁路，加速了国家工业化，也加强了国防建设。望继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，以多快好省的革命精神，修建更多更长更好的铁路。中国人民和人民解放军是会感激你们的。同志们，理论来自实践，技术出于劳动，这是真理，只要有敢想、敢说、敢干的精神，认真总结经验，就可以发展理论，提高技术。同志们，请记住毛主席的话，虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。进步与落后，骄傲与虚心，不仅过去和现在是存在的，将来永远也是存在的，不愿落后的人们，就永远不要骄傲。
    铁道部滕代远部长为专刊写的文章中说，铁道兵是在艰苦的战斗中诞生的，在节节的胜利中成长的，在国家的建设中壮大的。他们既是一个战斗队伍，又是一个建设队伍。在全国生产大跃进的形势下，他们将与全国铁路员工以及参加筑路的人民一道，更多更快更好更省地完成全国新建铁路的跃进计划。（附图片）
