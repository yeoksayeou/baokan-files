    Thoroughly Sweep Away Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Garbage
    Guangxi Party Congress Expels Members of Chen Zaili's Rightist Group from the Party

    Nanning Dispatch from Our Newspaper Correspondent Gong Jingzhi: The Third Session of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, lasting twenty days, concluded on July 1. The conference thoroughly exposed and criticized the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of the Chen Zaili-led rightist group and the rightist Xu Jiangping, and expelled them from the Party. This is another great victory on the political and ideological front within the Guangxi Party. The victory of this struggle is of extremely significant importance for purifying the Party organization, consolidating Party unity and unification, enhancing the Party's combat effectiveness, and implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction, thereby promoting the overall leap forward in socialist construction throughout the region.

    Three hundred and sixty-one delegates attended the congress, with five hundred and sixty-eight people attending as observers. The congress listened to and discussed Comrade Wei Guoqing, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee, report on the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, and the work report made by Comrade Liu Jianxun, First Secretary, on behalf of the Autonomous Region Party Committee to the congress. The conference adopted the methods of vigorous airing of views and the publication of big-character posters. Three hundred and eighteen people spoke at the meeting. A total of ten thousand two hundred and forty-nine big-character posters were posted. These speeches and big-character posters concentrated on exposing and criticizing the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of the Chen Zaili-led rightist group.

    According to the materials revealed during the congress and prior to it, it has been proven that a rightist group, headed by Chen Zaili, former member of the Standing Committee of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Governor of Guangxi Province, including former members of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee Wang Mengzhou, former Provincial Party Committee members Liao Yuan, Luo Ming, Wang Hao, and alternate member Liao Lianyuan, etc., began from the first meeting of the First Congress of the CPC Guangxi Provincial Committee in June 1956. Under the banner of "opposing rash advance" and "opposing subjectivism," they tried their best to denigrate the great achievements of agricultural collectivization and agricultural production, attack the leadership of the Party, and engage in activities to undermine the unity of the Party. By June 1957, when the central government announced the handling of the starvation deaths in Guangxi due to disaster, their anti-Party and anti-socialist activities reached their peak. At the Party meeting to investigate the starvation deaths due to disaster, they directly violated the central government's correct conclusion on the incident, created unnecessary complications, used the issue to their advantage, and insisted that the starvation deaths due to disaster were the result of collectivization and the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. Furthermore, they completely negated the achievements of Guangxi's work, believing that the Party had "committed a line error" in its rural work, demanding a "re-evaluation of rural work" and that the Provincial Party Committee "affirm its errors."

    The primary target of this rightist group's attack was the high tide of agricultural collectivization and the accompanying agricultural production from the second half of 1955 to the first half of 1956. They fundamentally denied the urgent demands of the broad masses of peasants to realize socialist agricultural collectivization, describing the socialist enthusiasm of the peasant masses as "forced." They vehemently attacked cooperatives, portraying cooperative production as a complete mess, saying that cooperatives "only care about the collective and not the individual," demanding the unlimited development of sideline occupations for cooperative members' families in order to undermine the collective production of cooperatives and make peasants retreat from the road of collectivization. They uniformly described all materials and figures sufficient to prove the achievements of agricultural production, especially the figures for increased grain production in the first half of 1956, as "bragging," "exaggeration," and a manifestation of "reporting only the good news and not the bad."

    Because the Party committee did not accept their reactionary views and carried out criticism and struggle against them, they tried their best to attack the Party's leadership. They adopted extremely despicable double-dealing tactics to undermine the Party's democratic centralism, distort the truth of Party life, and vigorously attack the "abnormal democratic life within the Party," "lack of democracy within the Party," and "the secretary covering the sky with one hand." The former Provincial Party Committee's implementation of the central government's policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results was attacked as "doctrinairism," "craving greatness and success," and "not proceeding from reality." In order to weaken and break away from the Party's leadership, they vigorously advocated decentralism, opposed the Party's leadership over government work, and resisted the Party's unified leadership over the work of various departments. They said that the Party's leadership was "failure to separate Party and government," "the Party substituting for the government," and "listening only to the local authorities and not to the central authorities." What was particularly bad was that they engaged in many non-organizational activities, with this anti-Party group as the center, spreading rumors everywhere, slandering comrades who adhered to the correct line, and vilifying the Party's leadership, attempting to cause the Party to fall into a state of division and paralysis.

    In order to achieve their anti-Party and anti-socialist goals, this rightist group, especially Liao Lianyuan, also confused and won over some comrades with unclear understanding, vigorously advocating localism and local nationalism. He fabricated accusations that the former Provincial Party Committee had "factionalism" and "Han chauvinism." He falsely accused the Party's rectification work on underground Party members and guerrillas in the early days of liberation as an unwarranted attack, exclusion, and harassment of local cadres and ethnic minority cadres. Last year, Liao Lianyuan took the opportunity of going to the countryside for inspection to fabricate facts, failing to distinguish between enemies and friends, and to voice grievances for some speculators and class dissidents who had been purged from the revolutionary ranks, and to deceive and incite the masses in some minority areas, attempting to provoke the masses' dissatisfaction with the Party. Chen Zaili also used localism and local nationalist sentiments to attack the Party committee for not paying attention to ethnic regional autonomy work, to deny the Party's great achievements in ethnic work, and to attempt to provoke ethnic relations and divide the unity of the various ethnic groups in Guangxi.

    When the Provincial Party Committee held a propaganda meeting last June, Luo Ming and Wang Hao, as the direct leaders of the meeting, actually twisted Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, denied the existance of the struggle between two roads, confused the line between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, and vigorously supported the rightists in attacking the Party, calling the anti-Party and anti-socialist statements of these rightists "valuable opinions."

    The evil wind stirred up by this rightist group has seriously harmed the cause of the Party. For a considerable period of time, due to their anti-Party activities, the centralized leadership of the former Provincial Party Committee was in extreme difficulty, the implementation of the Party's policies and lines was greatly hindered, and the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of basic-level cadres and the masses was severely hit. It also once caused ideological confusion among cadres, fostered tendencies of individualism, sectarianism, localism, and local nationalism, weakened the Party's combat effectiveness, and caused inestimable losses to the socialist construction cause of the whole region. The low tide in Guangxi's socialist construction from the second half of 1956 to the first half of 1957 was a direct result of this evil wind.

    The conference also exposed and criticized the rightist words and deeds of Xu Jiangping, Deputy Procurator-General of the Autonomous Region Procuratorate. During his tenure, his work consistently showed a right-leaning tendency. In particular, when the bourgeois rightists inside and outside the Party launched a frenzied attack on the Party last year, he viciously attacked the achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, "voiced grievances" for landlords, rich peasants, bad elements, and counter-revolutionaries, insisting that so-called "wrong cases" and "miscarriages of justice" accounted for more than 50%, and even called the incident of counter-revolutionary rioters killing our cadres a contradiction among the people. He slandered the broad masses of cadres as having "bad work styles" and being "lawless," and abused his power to attack cadres.

    The degeneration of these people into rightists is by no means accidental. Comrade Liu Jianxun pointed out in his report that although the members of this rightist group had joined the Party organizationally long ago, they were not true communists ideologically, their bourgeois stand had not been transformed, and coupled with the fact that they all had serious individualism, the result would naturally be that at the critical juncture of the socialist revolution, they would degenerate into agents of the bourgeoisie within the Party and embark on the path of anti-Party and anti-socialism. In the more than half a year before this congress, the Party repeatedly criticized and educated them, but they were all rejected. It was not until the plenary session of the Provincial Party Committee in February this year that a struggle was launched against them, and they were forced to admit some mistakes. From this, it can be seen that the reactionary stand of these people is extremely stubborn. At this congress, in the face of countless ironclad facts, they had to bow their heads and confess their guilt.

    Finally, the congress passed a resolution to expel Chen Zaili, Wang Mengzhou, Liao Yuan, Luo Ming, Wang Hao, and Liao Lianyuan, members of the Party's rightist group, from the Party, expel the rightist Xu Jiangping from the Party, remove all their positions within the Party, and recommend that the administrative departments remove all their positions in administrative work.

    The congress also made serious criticisms of other comrades who had committed serious right-leaning thoughts, localism, local nationalism, and decentralist tendencies. Comrades who had committed these mistakes made self-criticisms to the congress.

    The congress made it clear to Party organizations and all Party members at all levels throughout the region that they must seriously accept the above experiences and lessons: (1) We must continue to deepen the struggle between the two roads inside and outside the Party, carry out the rectification movement to the end, raise the socialist consciousness of all Party members and cadres, and strengthen the proletarian stand; (2) We must seriously study Marxist-Leninist theory, study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, improve our political acumen and vigilance, so that we can recognize the wind direction, distinguish between right and wrong, and dare to uphold the truth and wage an indomitable struggle for the truth; (3) We must adhere to maintaining the Party's unity on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, strengthen the Party's leadership, oppose unorganized and undisciplined decentralist tendencies, oppose individualism, liberalism, sectarianism, localism, local nationalism, adhere to the Party's democratic centralism, consolidate the Party's organization, and resolutely implement the principle of the Party's unified leadership.

    The meeting also re-elected members of the CPC Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee.

    纯洁党的组织　巩固党的团结和统一
    彻底扫除反党反社会主义的垃圾
    广西党代表大会开除陈再励右派集团的分子出党
    本报南宁电　记者宫敬之报道：中共广西僮族自治区第一届代表大会第三次会议历时二十天，已于7月1日闭幕。这次会议彻底揭发与批判了以陈再励为首的右派集团和右派分子徐江萍的反党反社会主义罪行，并把他们清除出党。这是广西党内政治、思想战线上又一次伟大的胜利。这一斗争的胜利，对纯洁党的组织，巩固党的团结和统一，增强党的战斗力，以及贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，推动全区社会主义建设事业的全面大跃进，有着极其重大的意义。
    出席这次大会的代表有三百六十一人，列席的有五百六十八人。大会听取与讨论了中共广西僮族自治区党委书记处书记韦国清同志关于党的“八大”二次会议精神的传达报告，和第一书记刘建勋同志代表自治区党委向大会作的工作报告。会议采取大鸣大放和出大字报的方法，在会上发言的有三百一十八人次。贴出的大字报共有一万零二百四十九张。这些发言和大字报，集中地揭发与批判了以陈再励为首的右派集团的反党反社会主义罪行。
    根据大会以及大会以前所揭发的材料证明，以前广西省委常委、广西省副省长陈再励为首的，包括前省委常委王梦周，前省委委员廖原、骆明、王浩，候补委员廖联原等人的一个反党反社会主义的右派集团，从1956年6月中共广西省第一届代表大会第一次会议开始，他们就打着“反冒进”、“反主观主义”的旗帜，极力诋毁农业合作化和农业生产取得的巨大成就，攻击党的领导，进行破坏党的团结的活动。到1957年6月，中央宣布处理广西因灾饿死人事件时，他们的反党反社会主义活动发展到最高峰。在党内检查因灾饿死人事件的会议上，他们直接违反中央对这一事件的正确结论，横生枝节，借题发挥，硬把因灾饿死人事件说成是合作化和粮食统购统销政策所带来的恶果，并进而全盘否定广西的工作成绩，认为党在农村工作上“犯了路线错误”，要求“重新估计农村工作”，要省委“肯定错误”。
    这一右派集团攻击的首要目标，是1955年下半年到1956年上半年的农业合作化和伴随而来的农业生产高潮。他们根本否定广大农民实现社会主义农业合作化的迫切要求，把农民群众的社会主义积极性说成是“强迫出来的”。他们竭力攻击合作社，把合作社的生产说得一团糟，说合作社“只顾集体，不顾个人”，要求无限制地发展社员家庭副业，借以瓦解合作社的集体生产，使农民从合作化的道路上倒退回去。对一切足以证明农业生产成绩的材料数字，特别是1956年上半年粮食增产的数字，他们一律说成是“吹牛”、“虚夸”，是“报喜不报忧”的表现。
    由于党委不接受他们的反动观点，并且对他们进行批判斗争，他们就竭力地攻击党的领导。他们采取极其卑鄙的两面派手法，来破坏党的民主集中制，歪曲党内生活的真相，大肆攻击“党内民主生活不正常”，“党内没有民主”，“书记一手遮天”。前省委贯彻执行中央多快好省的建设社会主义方针，被攻击为“教条主义”、“好大喜功”、“不从实际出发”。他们为了削弱和摆脱党的领导，就极力鼓吹分散主义，反对党对政府工作的领导，抗拒党对各部门工作的统一领导。说党的领导是“党政不分”、“以党代政”、“只听块块，不听条条”。特别恶劣的是，他们进行许多非组织活动，以这个反党集团为中心，到处散布流言蜚语，诬蔑坚持正确路线的同志，丑化党的领导，企图使党陷于分裂和瘫痪状态。
    为了达到他们反党反社会主义的目的，这个右派集团，特别是廖联原，还迷惑和拉拢一些认识不清的同志，极力鼓吹地方主义和地方民族主义。他无中生有地诬蔑前省委有“宗派主义”和“大汉族主义”。把解放初期党对地下党和游击队所进行的整顿工作，诬为对地方干部和民族干部的无故打击、排斥、刁难。廖联原在去年曾借下乡视察的机会，捏造事实，敌我不分，替一些被清洗出革命队伍的投机分子和阶级异己分子喊冤，并对一些少数民族地区的群众进行欺骗煽动，企图挑拨群众对党不满。陈再励也利用地方主义和地方民族主义情绪，来攻击党委不重视民族区域自治工作，抹煞党在民族工作方面的伟大成就，企图挑拨民族关系，分裂广西各族人民的团结。
    去年6月省委召开宣传会议时，作为会议的直接领导的骆明和王浩，竟然歪曲毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告，否认两条道路斗争的存在，混淆敌我矛盾与人民内部矛盾的界限，极力支持右派分子向党进攻，把这些右派分子的反党反社会主义的言论称作“宝贵的意见”。
    这一右派集团所刮起的妖风，已经严重地危害了党的事业。在一个相当长的时期内，由于他们的反党活动，使前省委的集中领导陷入了极度困难的境地，使党的方针路线的贯彻执行受到了极大的障碍，使广大基层干部和群众的社会主义积极性受到了沉重的打击。并一度造成了干部思想上的混乱，助长了个人主义、宗派主义、地方主义和地方民族主义的倾向，削弱了党的战斗力，给全区社会主义建设事业造成了不可估量的损失。1956年下半年到1957年上半年广西社会主义建设所出现的低潮，就是这股妖风直接造成的恶果。
    会议还揭发和批判了自治区检察院副检察长徐江萍的右派言行。在他任职期间，工作一贯表现右倾，特别是当去年党内外的资产阶级右派向党疯狂进攻时，他恶毒地攻击肃反成绩，替地主、富农、坏分子和反革命分子“伸冤”叫嚣，硬说所谓“冤案”、“错案”占50％以上，甚至竟把反革命暴乱分子杀害我们干部的事件，也称为人民内部矛盾。他诬蔑广大干部“作风恶劣”、“无法无天”，并滥用职权对干部进行打击。
    这些人堕落成右派分子决不是偶然的。刘建勋同志在报告中指出：这个右派集团的成员，虽然早就在组织上入了党，但他们在思想上并不是真正的共产主义者，他们的资产阶级立场并没有得到改造，加上他们都有严重的个人主义，发展的结果，自然就会在社会主义革命的紧要关头，堕落成为资产阶级在党内的代理人，走向反党反社会主义的道路。在这次大会以前的半年多内，党曾多次地对他们进行了批评教育，但都被拒绝了，直到今年2月省委全会向他们开展了斗争，他们才被迫承认了一些错误。由此可见，这些人的反动立场是极其顽固的。这次大会上，他们在无数铁的事实面前，不得不低头认罪了。
    最后大会通过了决议，开除党内右派集团陈再励、王梦周、廖原、骆明、王浩、廖联原的党籍，开除右派分子徐江萍的党籍，撤销他们在党内的一切职务，并建议行政方面撤销他们在行政工作方面所担负的一切职务。
    大会对其他犯有严重右倾思想、地方主义、地方民族主义和分散主义倾向的同志，也作了严肃的批判。犯有这些错误的同志都向大会作了检讨。
    大会向全区各级党组织和全体党员提出，必须认真接受以上经验教训：（1）必须在党内外继续深入开展两条道路的斗争，把整风运动进行到底，提高全体党员和干部的社会主义觉悟，坚定无产阶级的立场；（2）必须认真学习马克思列宁主义理论、学习毛泽东同志的著作，提高政治嗅觉和警惕性，才会识别风向，分清大是大非，敢于坚持真理，为真理进行不屈不挠的斗争；（3）必须坚持维护党在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结，加强党的领导，反对无组织无纪律的分散主义倾向，反对个人主义、自由主义、宗派主义、地方主义、地方民族主义，坚持党的民主集中制，巩固党的组织，坚决执行党的统一领导的原则。
    会议还补选了中共广西僮族自治区委员会的委员。
