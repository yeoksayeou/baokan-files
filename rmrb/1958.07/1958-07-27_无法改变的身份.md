    Unchangeable Identity
    Yi Fang
    The United States government is now doing everything possible to delay and obstruct the holding of a summit conference. It is said that one of the reasons is that if such a meeting is held, when discussing the causes and possible consequences of the armed intervention in the Middle East by the United States and Britain, the United States will be in the position of "defendant." Does not holding such a meeting mean that the American aggressors can change their identity as defendants?
    For a long time, the U.S. imperialists have committed many indelible crimes around the world: after World War II, it did everything possible to arm West Germany and Japan, so that the militarist forces of these two fascist countries were revived with its support; eight years ago, it launched a war of aggression in Korea and inhumanely used bacteriological weapons, creating滔天的bloody crimes; today, it brazenly marches into Lebanon, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's liberation struggle... All kinds of evil deeds have long shown that U.S. imperialism is the enemy of the people of the world. The people have repeatedly accused him of his bloody crimes, pointing their fingers at his nose and shouting angrily: "No U.S. arms for West Germany and Japan!" "U.S. troops get out of Korea!" "U.S. troops get out of Lebanon!" In the face of history's judge, U.S. imperialism is a criminal. If U.S. imperialism does not change its policy of aggression and coexist peacefully with all countries in the world, no matter what tricks it plays, it cannot change its identity as a defendant.

    无法改变的身份
    亦方
    美国政府现在正在千方百计地拖延和阻挠首脑会议的召开。据说，原因之一是：如果举行这样的会议，在讨论到美英两国武装干涉中东的原因和可能的后果时，美国站的是“被告地位”。难道不举行这样的会议，美国侵略者就可以改变它的被告的身份吗？
    长久以来，美帝国主义者在世界各地制造了许多无法灭迹的罪行：第二次世界大战以后，它竭尽全力武装西德和日本，使这两个法西斯国家的军国势力在它的扶植下借尸还魂；八年前，它又在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，并且灭绝人性地使用细菌武器，制造了滔天的血腥罪行；今天，它又悍然进军黎巴嫩，企图扑灭阿拉伯人民解放斗争的烈焰……种种罪恶行径，早已表明美帝国主义者是世界人民的敌人。人民一次再次地控诉他的血腥罪行，指着他的鼻子愤怒地喊出：“不许美国武装西德和日本！”“美国军队从朝鲜滚出去！”“美国军队从黎巴嫩滚出去！”在历史的裁判官面前，美帝国主义者是罪人。如果美帝国主义者不改变他的侵略政策，和世界各国和平共处，无论他耍出什么样的花招，都不能改变他的被告的身份的。
