Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Pyongyang: South Korea, once known as the "Granary of Korea," has been transformed into a land of hunger under the reactionary rule of the United States and the Lee Seung-man group for thirteen years. Currently, South Korea needs to import millions of "seok" (one "seok" equals 180 liters) of grain annually.

Currently, 1.3 million hectares (one hectare equals 15 "mu") of land in South Korean rural areas need to be reclaimed and improved. At the same time, the U.S. imperialists and the Lee Seung-man group have allocated over 100,000 hectares of farmland for military use.

According to South Korean newspapers, in 1956, South Korea's cultivated land was 250,000 hectares less than during the Japanese imperialist rule in 1944; the sown area was 440,000 hectares less than the annual average sown area from 1930 to 1936. With the substantial reduction in sown area, South Korea's rice production in 1956 decreased by 32% compared to 1941.

In 1957, the production of cotton, which accounts for a large proportion of South Korean farmers' income, fell to a quarter of the average annual production during the period of Japanese imperialist rule, and the production of silkworm cocoons was halved.

According to South Korean newspaper reports, with the decreasing production of agricultural products in South Korea, U.S. imperialists have dumped surplus goods worth $2,188 million into South Korea, most of which are surplus agricultural products.

U.S. imperialists have maintained the feudal land relations in South Korean rural areas. After occupying South Korea in 1945, U.S. imperialists immediately announced that South Korea's land ownership system would not be changed, and tenant farmers must unconditionally pay rent to landlords.

In 1950, U.S. imperialists instructed the Lee Seung-man group to implement a deceptive "land reform." Farmers who were allocated land in the so-called "land reform" had to pay 30% of their average grain production as compensation for the land. At the same time, during the seven years since the so-called "land reform" was implemented, the U.S.-Lee group set the standard for average grain production at the highest record before 1942, thereby plundering an additional 16.8 million "seok" of rice from the farmers.

Due to the "land reform," farmers were not only forced to pay for the land they were allocated but also forced to pay various miscellaneous taxes related to farmland in kind, including land income tax. Thus, South Korean farmers have to hand over 60% to 70% of their harvest every year.

The bankruptcy of the rural economy and this cruel exploitation have plunged South Korean farmers into an abyss of poverty and hunger.

The debts of South Korean farmers have increased from 20 billion won in 1954 to 100 billion won in the first half of 1957. Even according to reduced figures, the number of South Korean farm households without grain had reached approximately 1.2 million in 1957.

    美李集团榨干农民血汗  南朝鲜变成饥饿的土地
    新华社平壤7日电  据朝鲜中央通讯社平壤讯：号称“朝鲜谷仓”的南朝鲜十三年来在美国和李承晚集团的反动统治下，已经变成了饥饿的土地。目前，南朝鲜每年要进口几百万石（一石合一百八十公升）的谷物。
    目前，南朝鲜农村中有一百三十万公顷（一公顷合十五市亩）的土地需要重新开垦和改良。同时，美国帝国主义者和李承晚集团还把十万公顷以上的农田划归军用。
    据南朝鲜报纸报道，1956年，南朝鲜的耕地比1944年日本帝国主义者统治时期的耕地还要少二十五万公顷；播种面积比1930年到1936年的每年平均播种面积少四十四万公顷。在播种面积大量减少的情况下，1956年南朝鲜的大米产量比1941年减少32％。
    1957年，占南朝鲜农民收入很大比重的棉花的产量下降到日本帝国主义统治时期的平均年产量的四分之一，蚕茧的产量则降低了一半。
    据南朝鲜报纸消息，在南朝鲜农产品的产量日益减少的情况下，美国帝国主义者已经向南朝鲜倾销了价值二十一亿八千八百万美元的剩余物资，其中绝大部分是剩余农产品。
    美帝国主义者保持了南朝鲜农村中的封建土地关系。美帝国主义者在1945年占领南朝鲜以后曾经立即宣布，南朝鲜的土地所有制不改变，佃农必须无条件地向地主交付地租。
    在1950年，美国帝国主义者指示李承晚集团实施骗人的“土地改革”。那些在所谓“土地改革”中分配到土地的农民必须缴出他们的谷物的平均产量的30％，作为土地的补偿。同时，美李集团在实行所谓“土地改革”以来的七年期间，把谷物平均产量的标准订在1942年以前最高的纪录上，从而从农民那里多掠夺走一千六百八十万石大米。
    由于“土地改革”，农民不仅被迫交纳所分配到的田地的偿付谷物，而且被迫用实物交纳各种各样有关农田的杂税，其中包括土地所得税。这样，南朝鲜农民每年就得拿出他们收成的60％到70％。
    农村经济的破产和这种残酷的敲诈使得南朝鲜农民陷于贫穷和饥饿的深渊中。
    南朝鲜农民所负的债务已经从1954年的二百亿圆增加到1957年上半年的一千亿圆。即使根据缩小了的数字，南朝鲜的无粮农户在1957年已经达到约一百二十万户。
