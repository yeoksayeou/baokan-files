Field Management Breaks Old Experiences
Liucun Village in Anguo County Adopts New Management Techniques, Summer Crops Grow Uniformly and Vigorously
    (Our Newspaper) Anguo County, Hebei Province - Farmers in Liucun Village, Anguo County, have liberated their thinking during the summer management of crops, breaking away from the superstitions of old experiences and habits from individual production. Based on the new production conditions, they have boldly adopted new management techniques, resulting in over 3,000 mu of crops growing more uniformly and vigorously than ever before in the village.

    Last winter and spring, the farmers of Liucun Village, Anguo County, actively built and drilled mechanized wells, increased fertilizer accumulation, and deep-plowed the land, creating favorable conditions for this year's crop growth. During spring sowing, they also promoted advanced production techniques such as early planting and close planting. However, due to insufficient understanding of the new favorable conditions brought about by the Great Leap Forward, many farmers were still bound by old experiences and habits in their thinking. During the summer field management of crops, some people still wanted to follow the old experiences and habits of the past. To thoroughly liberate the farmers' thinking and improve the summer management of crops, the Liucun Party organization took a series of measures.

    Before the start of summer management, the Liucun Party Branch and the Agricultural Production Cooperative Management Committee organized a widespread debate in conjunction with revising production targets and contracting work to households. During the debate, they guided farmers to calculate water accounts, fertilizer accounts, and labor contributions, comparing them with previous years, so that farmers could recognize the new situation of more labor, sufficient water, and abundant fertilizer in summer management. At the same time, they also discussed technical measures to fully utilize the new production conditions to ensure increased production. In this way, the old experiences of individual farmers, who had to drought-stress seedlings due to lack of fertilizer, water shortage, and insufficient labor, were broken from the perspective of understanding. This year, after the corn seedlings in this cooperative emerged, there was an unevenness in growth. At that time, many farmers believed that this was a natural phenomenon that could never be remedied. The Party and cooperative organizations summarized the past experience of cooperative member Wang Zhongkui in fertilizing weak seedlings, and had Wang Zhongkui introduce his past achievements and experience to the masses, demonstrate in the fields, and help farmers liberate their thinking. The entire cooperative's corn, cotton, and sweet potatoes were combined with watering for a round of supplementary fertilization for weak seedlings, ensuring the uniform and vigorous growth of the crops. When promoting appropriate deep hoeing during the seedling stage of cotton, many people believed, based on old experiences, that deep hoeing would damage the seedlings. The Party branch instructed the secretary in charge of cotton to conduct experiments first, and organized production team leaders to visit the site, dig up soil to check the cotton roots, and explain the principle that loose soil after proper deep hoeing can easily increase soil temperature and promote cotton seedling growth, breaking the superstitious thinking of old experiences. When fertilizing sweet potatoes in this village, some people, based on old experiences, said that concentrated fertilization would burn the seedlings. The Party organization conducted a comparison between concentrated fertilization and general spreading fertilization in the experimental fields. As a result, due to sufficient irrigation from mechanized wells, the sweet potato vines with concentrated fertilization grew longer, the leaves were larger, and the growth was vigorous, powerfully breaking people's superstition about old experiences. The Red and Expert School run by the Liucun Party organization absorbed more than 40 young adults to systematically study the basic knowledge of cultivating cotton, wheat, corn, and other crops. Many farmers understood the rules and conditions of crop production and no longer believed in old experiences. According to current statistics, among the 42 production team leaders in the entire cooperative, the number of those who broke superstitions and managed crops according to the new conditions has increased from 33 two months ago to 39. This year, the spring crops in this village were not stunted, and watering and topdressing were carried out half a month earlier than in previous years, and management was very timely. Now, corn, cotton, sorghum, sweet potatoes and other crops have been watered two or three times and fertilized once or twice. All kinds of crops are unprecedentedly vigorous and fertile. The corn stalks are tall and thick, and have begun to tassel. The fruiting branches of cotton are emerging earlier and growing more than in previous years, and budding has begun half a month earlier. The average tillering of multi-headed sorghum is more than seven, which is also a rare phenomenon.

    田间管理破除陈旧经验
    安国县流村采用新的管理技术夏庄稼长得匀整壮茁
    本报讯  河北省安国县流村农民在农作物夏季管理中，解放思想，破除个体生产时陈旧经验和习惯的迷信，根据新的生产条件大胆采用新的管理技术，全村三千多亩庄稼长得空前匀整茁壮。
    安国县流村农民去冬今春曾积极修打机井，增加积肥和深翻土地，为今年的农作物生长创造了有利条件。春季播种时，又推广了早播、密植等先进生产技术。但由于对大跃进带来的新的有利条件认识不足，许多农民在思想上仍受着旧经验、老习惯的束缚。在夏季农作物田间管理当中，还有些人想按过去的老经验、旧习惯办事。为了彻底解放农民思想，作好农作物的夏季管理，中共流村党组织曾采取了一系列的措施。
    夏季管理开始前，中共流村党支部和农业生产合作社管委会即结合着修订生产指标包工包产，组织了一次广泛的辩论。在辩论中，引导农民算水账、算肥账、算出工，并和往年作比较，让农民认识夏季管理当中工多、水足、肥大的新情况。同时还讨论了充分运用新的生产条件保证增产的技术措施。这样，过去个体农民因为缺肥、短水、劳力不足不得不旱苗蹲苗的陈旧经验，便被从认识上打破了。今年这个社的玉米苗出土后，曾发生壮弱不齐的现象。当时许多农民都认为这是自然现象，从来就没法补救。党社组织便总结了社员王中奎过去弱苗补肥的经验，让王中奎向群众介绍过去的成绩和经验，在田里作表演，帮助农民解放了思想。全社的玉米、棉花、甘薯都结合着浇水进行了一次弱棵补肥，保证了庄稼苗的匀整茁壮。在棉苗幼期推行适当深锄时，许多人根据旧经验认为深锄伤苗。党支部就责成主管棉花的书记先作试验，并组织生产队长到现场参观，刨土检查棉根，同时讲解适当深锄后土松容易提高地温，棉苗适长的道理，打破对旧经验的迷信思想。这村在甘薯施肥时，有些人曾根据老经验说集中施肥烧苗，党组织即在试验田里作了集中施肥和普面撒肥的对比，结果由于机井灌溉浇水充足，集中施肥的甘薯蔓长叶大生长茁壮，有力地破除了人们对老经验的迷信。流村党组织主办的红专学校，曾吸收四十多名青壮年系统学习栽培棉、麦、玉米等作物的基本知识。许多农民懂得了农作物生产的规律和条件，便不再迷信陈旧的经验。根据目前统计，全社四十二个生产队长当中，破除迷信按新的条件管理庄稼的，已由两个月前的三十三人增加到三十九人。今年，这村的春庄稼都没有蹲苗，比往年提前半个多月浇水追肥，管理的很及时。现在，玉米、棉花、高粱、甘薯等作物已分别浇了两三次水，追了一两次肥。各种作物都空前茁壮肥硕。玉米茎高秸粗，已开始吐天穗。棉花果枝比往年出的早长的多，已提前半个多月出蕾。多穗高粱平均分蘖七棵多，也是少见的现象。
