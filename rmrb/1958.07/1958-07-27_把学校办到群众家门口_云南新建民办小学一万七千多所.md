Bring Schools to the Doorsteps of the Masses
Yunnan Builds Over 17,000 New Private Elementary Schools

    (Our dispatch) Reporter Zhang Tinggan reports: Yunnan Province's effort to popularize elementary education has entered a phase of rapid development. In the past three months, 680,000 school-age children have enrolled in school throughout the province.

    A large-scale mass school-building campaign began in the province in April and May, with over 17,000 new private elementary schools established recently. Sixty-seven counties and cities, including Qujing and Zhaotong Special Districts, have already popularized elementary education, with enrollment reaching 90%–95% of school-age children. Currently, the number of children in school in Yunnan Province has increased to over 2.16 million, accounting for 76% of school-age children.

    Although Yunnan Province's elementary education has developed rapidly in recent years, it has been very uneven, with few schools in the remote, high-altitude mountain areas and border ethnic regions. Many villages are dozens or even over a hundred *li* from towns, making it impossible for children of all ethnic groups to study elsewhere. In April and May of this year, the masses in various localities, through extensive debates, refuted the arguments that it was difficult to lead school-building in remote mountainous areas, that economic conditions were backward, that there was a lack of teachers, and that it was impossible to popularize education. The masses produced during the day and felled bamboo and timber at night to make desks and chairs, climbing mountains and crossing ridges to invite teachers, generally establishing schools in three to five days. Zhaotong Special District, which had a poor foundation and many high-altitude mountain areas, became the fastest special district in the province to popularize elementary education. In order to adapt to the characteristics of sparsely populated mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation, many townships and communes established schools in each production team, bringing elementary schools to the doorsteps of the masses. Most schools in Qujing Special District have achieved "four inseparable" (inseparable from the commune, inseparable from production, inseparable from the family, and learning culture is inseparable from learning technology). The masses welcome such schools. By the end of June, the eight ethnic minority autonomous prefectures in Yunnan had over 8,000 elementary schools with over 700,000 students of all ethnic groups. Among them, there were over 3,000 elementary schools for single ethnic groups, with a total of over 370,000 ethnic minority students. The Ximeng Kawa ethnic region, which had never had schools before, has also established seven elementary schools, with nearly 600 Kawa children enrolled in school. (Attached photo)

    把学校办到群众家门口
    云南新建民办小学一万七千多所
    本报讯　记者张廷干报道：云南省普及小学教育工作已经进入飞跃阶段。三个月来，全省已经有六十八万适龄儿童入学。
    大规模的群众办学运动从4、5月份就在全省展开，最近办起的民办小学就有一万七千多所。曲靖、昭通专区等六十七个县市已经普及小学教育，入学儿童达到适龄儿童的90％—95％。目前，云南省在校儿童已增加到二百一十六万多人，占适龄儿童的76％。
    云南省小学教育事业几年来虽然发展较快，但很不平衡，内地高寒山区和边疆民族地区学校仍然很少。许多村寨离城几十里到一百多里，各族儿童无法到外地去读书。今年4、5月份，各地群众通过大辩论，驳倒了所谓边远山区办学不好领导，经济落后，缺乏师资，无法普及教育等论点。群众白天生产，晚上采伐竹木造桌椅，爬山越岭去请教师，一般在三、五天内就办起了学校。基础差、高寒山区多的昭通专区，成了全省普及小学教育最快的专区。为了适应山区地广人稀、交通不便的特点，许多乡社每个生产队都办了学，把小学办在群众的家门口。曲靖专区多数学校做到了“四不离”（不离开社、不脱离生产、不远离家庭、学文化不离学技术）。群众很欢迎这样的学校。到6月底，云南八个少数民族自治州已经有小学八千多所，各族学生七十多万人。其中，单一民族的小学就有三千多所，共有少数民族学生三十七万多人。从来没有办过学校的西盟山佧瓦族地区，也出现了七所小学，有近六百名佧瓦族子弟入学读书。（附图片）
