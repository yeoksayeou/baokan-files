Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: Since the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927, some active duty officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have lost their ability to work due to old age, physical weakness, overwork, illness, and disabilities sustained from injuries after nearly thirty years of revolutionary war. The "Provisional Regulations on the Handling of Retirement for Active Duty Officers," passed by the 78th plenary session of the State Council on July 5, was formulated to establish a retirement system for officers and properly settle this group of officers.

The provisional regulations stipulate that active duty officers who meet one of the following conditions may retire: (1) Having served their full term of active duty in accordance with the "Regulations on Service of Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and being 55 years of age or older; (2) Being unable to continue performing actual work due to overwork, illness, physical weakness, or work-related injuries and disabilities, and also being unable to return to production to participate in labor.

In the State Council's Provisional Regulations on the Handling of Retirement for Active Duty Officers, the living expenses standards for retired officers are stipulated based on their contributions to the revolution during various revolutionary war periods: (1) Officers retiring due to old age, overwork, illness, or physical weakness will be paid 40% to 100% of their original salary, depending on the different historical periods in which they participated in the revolution.
	(2) Officers retiring due to work-related injuries and disabilities will be paid 65% to 80% of their original salary, depending on whether they need assistance with daily living. (3) For retired officers who have made special contributions in combat or military construction, it is also stipulated that their living expenses may be appropriately increased, but the increase shall not exceed 15% of their original salary, and the result of the increase shall not exceed 100% of their original salary. (4) For some retired officers whose health has improved or returned to normal after retirement, in order to encourage them to participate actively in socialist construction, it is stipulated that local people's committees should arrange for them to participate in appropriate labor or work, and the competent authorities may reduce or suspend their living expenses depending on the circumstances.

Retired officers who have been tempered by long revolutionary wars have rich experience in military and mass work. Although they cannot continue to undertake heavy work tasks, they can still play a significant role in connecting and uniting the masses, conducting propaganda and education among the masses, especially in educating the younger generation to carry forward the revolutionary tradition of hard work. In order to encourage them to continue to do what they can for the Party and the people, the provisional regulations require people's committees at all levels to select retired officers above the rank of captain who joined the army during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War and the War of Resistance Against Japan, and who have a high reputation, and appropriately assign them to various honorary positions.

The provisional regulations also point out that military cadres who were previously supported by the state shall be handled in accordance with these regulations from the date of their implementation.

In addition, these provisional regulations also make clear provisions regarding the authority for approving officer retirements, medical issues after officer retirement, funeral subsidies and family pensions after the death of retired officers, and other issues.

The provisional regulations finally require the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to formulate detailed rules for the implementation of these regulations.

The entire text of the State Council's Provisional Regulations on the Handling of Retirement for Active Duty Officers embodies the spirit of the Party and the state to properly arrange for and be responsible to the end for retired officers.

    妥善安排　负责到底
    国务院通过现役军官退休的暂行规定
    新华社14日讯　自从1927年8月1日南昌武装起义以来，中国人民解放军有一部分现役军官，在经历了将近三十年的革命战争以后，因为年老体衰、积劳成疾和负伤残废而丧失工作能力。7月5日国务院全体会议第七十八次会议通过的“关于现役军官退休处理的暂行规定”，就是为了建立军官退休制度，妥善地安置这一部分军官而制定的。
    这个暂行规定规定了现役军官符合下列条件之一的就可以退休：（一）按照“中国人民解放军军官服役条例”的规定，服满现役，年满五十五周岁以上的；（二）因为积劳成疾、身体衰弱、因公负伤残废，不能继续担任实际工作，又不能回到生产中去参加劳动的。
    国务院关于现役军官退休处理的暂行规定中，根据退休军官在历史上各个革命战争时期对革命的贡献，规定了军官退休以后的生活费标准：（一）因为年老、积劳成疾、身体衰弱而退休的军官，按照他们参加革命的不同历史时期，分别发给本人原薪金的40％到100％。
  （二）对于因公负伤身体残废而退休的军官，按照饮食起居需要人扶助或不需要人扶助的情况，分别发给本人原薪金的65％到80％。（三）对于在作战、建军中有特殊贡献的退休军官，还规定可以酌情提高其生活费，但提高部分不得超过本人原薪金的15％，其提高的结果不得超过本人原薪金数额的100％。（四）对于有些在退休以后健康状况好转或者已经恢复正常的退休军官，为了发挥他们参加社会主义建设的积极性，规定还要求当地人民委员会安排他们参加适当的劳动或工作，主管机关可以根据情况减发或者停发他们的生活费。
    经过长期革命战争锻炼的退休军官，有着丰富的军事工作和群众工作经验，现在他们虽然不能继续担负繁重的工作任务，但在联系和团结群众，在群众中进行宣传教育，特别是教育青年一代发扬艰苦奋斗的革命传统方面，仍然可以发挥很大的作用。为了鼓励他们继续为党为人民做一些他们所能胜任的工作，暂行规定要求各地人民委员会从第二次国内革命战争时期和抗日战争时期入伍的大尉以上的退休军官中，选择威信较高的，酌情分配他们担任各种荣誉职务。
    暂行规定还指出：过去由国家供养的军队干部，自本规定施行之日起，一律按照本规定处理。
    此外，这个暂行规定对于军官退休的批准权限，军官退休后的医疗问题，退休军官死亡后的丧葬补助、亲属抚恤等问题，都作了明确的规定。
    暂行规定最后要求中国人民解放军总干部部制定本规定的实施细则。
    国务院关于现役军官退休处理的暂行规定的全部条文，贯穿着党和国家对退休军官妥善安排、负责到底的精神。
