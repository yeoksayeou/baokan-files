    Caiping Mountain is an earth and rock mountain in Yuxian County, Henan Province. Before liberation, it was a barren mountain with rolling flash floods during heavy rains. Starting in the winter of 1956, under the leadership of the Party, water and soil conservation projects were built to control floods, and various fruit trees were planted. This year, crops were planted on the top of the mountain for the first time.

    菜坪山是河南省禹县一座土石山。解放前是荒山秃岭，每逢暴雨，山洪滚滚。从1956年冬开始，在党的领导下，修建了水土保持工程，控制了洪水，并种植了各种果树。今年又在山顶上第一次种植庄稼。
