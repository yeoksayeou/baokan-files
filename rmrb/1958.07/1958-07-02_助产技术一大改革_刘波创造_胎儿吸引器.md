A Major Reform in Obstetrics Technology
Liu Bo Creates "Fetal Suction Device"

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the *Liberation Army Daily*: Liu Bo, a doctor at the health clinic of the 101 Factory of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, with the support of the Party and the assistance of comrades, after two years of hard work and repeated experiments, has created a "fetal suction device."

The "fetal suction device" is an obstetric instrument that uses the principle of vacuum suction to hold the fetal head for assisted delivery. In the past, when forceps were used for difficult births, it not only caused a certain degree of damage to the mother and the fetus, but also the operation of forceps technology was not something that ordinary doctors could master. According to the trial use of the "fetal suction device" at the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, the results of fifty cases were very good, greatly shortening the duration of the second stage of labor and reducing the pain of the parturient. The "fetal suction device" is easy to disinfect, easy to operate, does not require anesthesia, and the production cost is not high, so it can be widely used in urban and rural hospitals or delivery stations.

    助产技术一大改革
    刘波创造“胎儿吸引器”
    本报讯　据解放军报报道：解放军某部一○一工厂卫生保健站医生刘波，在党的支持和同志们的协助下，经过两年的刻苦钻研和反复试验，创造了一种“胎儿吸引器”。
    “胎儿吸引器”是利用真空吸着原理吸住胎头进行助产的一种产科器械。过去难产使用产钳时，不仅使母亲和胎儿造成某种程度的损伤，同时产钳技术的操作也不是一般医生所能掌握。据解放军总医院试用“胎儿吸引器”，前后五十例效果都很好，大大缩短了第二产程的时间，减少了产妇的痛苦。“胎儿吸引器”消毒简便，容易操作，不需要麻醉，并且制作成本不大，城市、乡村医院或接生站都可以广泛使用。
