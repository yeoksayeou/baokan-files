The Tianjin Automobile and Vehicle Fittings Industrial Company will assist the pastoral and semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral areas of the Ulanqab League in Inner Mongolia to build twenty small blast furnaces with an annual output of 2,300 tons of pig iron, a small steel plant with an annual output of 6,000 tons of steel, and a rolling mill with an annual output of 5,000 tons of shaped steel. This is stipulated in an agreement signed on June 27 by representatives of the Tianjin Automobile and Vehicle Fittings Industrial Company and representatives of the Ulanqab League of Inner Mongolia. According to the agreement, the construction of some small blast furnaces will commence soon and be completed and put into production in August this year. The steel plant will be completed and produce steel in October, and the rolling mill will also be completed within the fourth quarter of this year. The agreement stipulates that in addition to being responsible for supplying Ulanqab League with a complete set of equipment, design, installation, and technical guidance for iron smelting, steelmaking, and rolling mills, the Tianjin Automobile and Vehicle Fittings Industrial Company will also be responsible for teaching production and operation techniques until they are fully mastered. To accommodate the financial difficulties of the Ulanqab League, the company will also provide some funds in the form of supporting equipment, deferred collection of payments, and advance payments. This agreement fully embodies the spirit of mutual support and full support for ethnic minority areas, and will play a significant role in the industrial construction of Inner Mongolia.
