	Ten Thoughts of Chairman Mao
	Thinking of Chairman Mao,
	Liberation is all thanks to you,
	Overthrew the Chiang bandit reactionaries,
	Peasants turned over and were truly happy.
	Thinking of Chairman Mao,
	Happiness all relies on you,
	Rent and interest reduction and anti-hegemony,
	Land reform, dividing houses and dividing land.
	Thinking of Chairman Mao,
	Working the fields makes me think of you,
	Thousands of villages and households collectivized,
	Iron oxen plow the fields, saving labor.
	Thinking of Chairman Mao,
	Eating makes me think of you,
	Unified purchase and sale of grain,
	Stable prices, not being cheated.
	Thinking of Chairman Mao,
	Sleeping makes me think of you,
	In the past, tattered cotton wool had no cover,
	Now covered with new floral quilts.
	Thinking of Chairman Mao,
	Buying things makes me think of you,
	Supply and marketing cooperatives were established,
	Goods are genuine and prices are low.
	Thinking of Chairman Mao,
	Reading newspapers and writing make me think of you,
	Just because literacy classes were established,
	Learned culture and understood principles.
	Thinking of Chairman Mao,
	Being sick makes me think of you,
	Traditional Chinese and Western medicine come to diagnose and treat,
	Sincere and earnest.
	Thinking of Chairman Mao,
	At night, I think of you,
	Broadcast music and opera,
	Every household has bright electric lights.
	Thinking of Chairman Mao,
	Harmony makes me think of you,
	Working people are one family,
	Loving each other like brothers.
	Thinking of Chairman Mao day and night,
	Men, women, old and young all miss him,
	Chairman's kindness is incomparably deep.
	Thinking of him day and night,
	Thinking of our benefactor, Chairman Mao,
	Millions of people are of one mind to congratulate,
	Congratulations to Chairman Mao for ten thousand years.

    十想毛主席	陈光训
    一想毛主席，
    解放多亏你，
    打垮蒋贼反动派，
    农民翻身真欢喜。
    二想毛主席，
    幸福全靠你，
    减租减息又反霸，
    土改分房又分地。
    三想毛主席，
    作田想起你，
    千村万户合作化，
    铁牛耕地省劳力。
    四想毛主席，
    吃饭想起你，
    粮食统购又统销，
    物价稳定不受欺。
    五想毛主席，
    睡觉想起你，
    过去破絮没有盖，
    如今盖上新花被。
    六想毛主席，
    买物想起你，
    办起供销合作社，
    货真价又低。
    七想毛主席，
    看报写字想起你，
    只因办了扫盲班，
    学了文化懂道理。
    八想毛主席，
    害病想起你，
    中医西医来诊治，
    诚心又诚意。
    九想毛主席，
    夜晚想起你，
    广播音乐又唱戏，
    户户电灯明。
    十想毛主席，
    和睦想起你，
    劳动人民是一家，
    相亲相爱如兄弟。
    日想毛主席，
    夜想毛主席，
    男女老少都想念，
    主席恩情深无比。
    日也想来夜也思，
    想念恩人毛主席，
    万众一心同祝贺，
    祝贺主席万万岁。
              （江西遂川）
