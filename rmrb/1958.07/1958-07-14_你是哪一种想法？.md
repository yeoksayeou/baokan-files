    What Kind of Thinking Are You?
    Méi Ěr
    These past few days, newspapers have been filled with news of miracles: Shanghai Guangci Hospital saved a patient named Qiu Cai Kang, who had burns covering 84.5% of his body; the Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the semiconductor transistor with the highest power and highest frequency in the world; Chen Da Dui, a farmer in Jiangxi, invented a new pesticide with insecticidal effects exceeding "666"; Zhu Xiangjie and Li Xuecheng, workers at the Tianjin Electric Motor Factory, used chemical methods to replace manual scraping of enamel-insulated wire ends, increasing work efficiency more than 14,000 times; Tsinghua University in Beijing manufactured high-grade welding rods that surpassed the Swedish brand name product that currently dominates the world market. …
    Faced with these miracles, everyone has their own thoughts. Among my friends, there are these two kinds of thinking:
    One kind of thinking: As long as we break down superstitions, liberate our minds, set lofty goals, and work hard, everyone can invent and everyone can create. They say: Taking the case of Shanghai Guangci Hospital saving patient Qiu Cai Kang as an example, the doctors at this hospital originally also believed in foreign countries and books. Some of them said that according to international medical literature, a patient like Qiu Cai Kang would die within seventy-two hours. Only after the enlightenment and education of the hospital's Party organization did the doctors overcome their inferiority complex and accept the task of treating Qiu Cai Kang.
    Another kind of thinking: The reason these people are able to create inventions is because they have the conditions and opportunities for creative inventions; as long as they have the same conditions and the same opportunities, they can also invent and create. Of course, it is a bit difficult to have the same conditions and the same opportunities. First, not everyone is a doctor or a scientific researcher. Second, even if everyone were a doctor or a scientific researcher, not everyone could have a patient like Qiu Cai Kang or have a topic like researching semiconductors. In fact, taking the doctors at Shanghai Guangci Hospital as an example, it is impossible for them all to have the same conditions. Although they are all doctors, some are surgeons and some are internists; some have been practicing medicine for decades, and some have only been practicing for a few years. Opportunities are even more so. Since its establishment, Shanghai Guangci Hospital has only encountered one patient like Qiu Cai Kang.
    It should be said that everyone has the conditions and opportunities to create miracles. Workers, farmers, students, and office workers can all invent and create in their own positions, and as long as someone is willing to invent and create, they will immediately receive enthusiastic support from all sides. In his report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress on behalf of the Party Central Committee, Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: Now the Party and the country need a large number of people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, people who dare to break down superstitions, innovate and create, people who dare to adhere to the truth, charge into battle for the truth, and establish advanced and revolutionary banners. The Party and the country must rely on such people to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. This should be the best condition and the best opportunity for invention and creation.
    Some people will say that my kind of work makes it impossible to invent and create. This statement is also incorrect. There are opportunities for invention and creation in any job. Taking mimeograph work as an example, this work has always been considered a monotonous work, but Tian Yuxin and Zhang Xingshan, mimeograph operators at the Ministry of Foreign Trade, created a hand-cranked ink mixer, and another mimeograph operator, Bai Yongquan, invented an automatic inking roller.
    The conditions are there, and the opportunities are also there, but there is one thing that not everyone has. What is it? That is the idea of striving to be upstream and striving to be the first. Without this kind of thinking, even if the conditions and opportunities are very good, there will still be no inventions or creations; with this kind of thinking, even if the conditions and opportunities are not very good, there will still be inventions and creations.

    你是哪一种想法？
    梅耳
    这几天报纸上，几乎登满了创造奇迹的消息：上海广慈医院救活了一个烫伤面积达84.5％的叫丘财康的病人，中国科学院应用物理研究所创造了目前世界上功率最大、频率最高的半导体晶体管，江西农民陈大兑发明了杀虫功效超过“六六六”的新农药，天津电机厂工人祝相杰、李学成用化学方法代替人工刮漆包线头，提高工作效率一万四千多倍，北京清华大学制成了超过目前世界市场上称雄的瑞典名牌货高级焊条。……
    在这些奇迹面前，每个人都有自己的想法。在我的朋友中，就有这样两种想法：
    一种想法：只要破除迷信，解放思想，立大志，下苦功，人人可以发明，个个能够创造。他们说：拿上海广慈医院救活病人丘财康这件事情来说，这个医院的医生本来也是迷信外国，迷信书本的，他们中就有人说，按照国际医学文献规定，丘财康这样的病人，在七十二小时内就要死去。经过这个医院党组织的启发教育，医生们才打掉自卑感，接受了治疗丘财康的任务。
    另一种想法：这些人所以能够创造发明，是因为有创造发明的条件和机会；只要有同样的条件同样的机会，也可以发明创造。要有同样的条件、同样的机会当然有点难办，第一，大家不都是医生或不都是科学研究人员。第二，即使都是医生或都是科学研究人员，又不都可以有丘财康这样的病人或都有研究半导体这样的题目。其实，就拿上海广慈医院的医生来说，也都不可能具备同样的条件，虽然他们都是医生，但是有的是外科医生，有的是内科医生；有的是已行医数十年，有的是行医才几年。机会更是如此，上海广慈医院成立以来，也只发现了一个丘财康这样的病人。
    应该说，创造奇迹的条件和机会每个人都有。工人、农民、学生，机关工作人员，都可以在自己的岗位上发明创造，而且只要有人愿意发明创造，立刻就会得到各方面的热情支持。刘少奇同志代表党中央向八大二次会议的报告中说：现在党和国家需要大批敢想敢说敢做的人，敢于破除迷信、革新创造的人，敢于坚持真理、为真理冲锋陷阵、树立先进和革命旗帜的人。党和国家就要依靠这样的人，多快好省地建设社会主义。这该是发明创造的最好的条件最好的机会。
    有人会说，像我这样的工作，就无法发明创造。这种说法也是不对的。不论在什么工作岗位上，都有发明创造的机会。拿油印工作来说，这个工作，从来被人认为是个刻板的工作，可是外贸部的油印员田玉信、张性善就创造了手摇调墨器，另一位油印员白永泉发明了自动上油滚。
    条件都有，机会也都有，但是有一样东西倒不是人人都有的。是什么东西呢？那就是力争上游、力争第一的思想。没有这种思想，即使条件和机会都很好，也还是不会有什么发明创造的；有了这种思想，即使条件和机会都不很好，还会有发明创造。
