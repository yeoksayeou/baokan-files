    How to Treat Body Odor?

    The occurrence of body odor is related to a person's constitution. The reason is that the apocrine glands in the armpit skin secrete too much, or the secretion is abnormal, which causes body odor. In summer, because of excessive sweating, the odor is even stronger. This kind of sweat gland only starts to secrete during puberty, and it will generally decrease when adulthood is reached, and will atrophy in old age. Therefore, body odor is more common in young people, it will lessen in adulthood, and may even disappear by itself in old age. Body odor is hereditary, but it will not infect others, nor will it affect one's own health, only the smell is unpleasant.

    People with body odor can reduce the odor by bathing frequently, changing clothes diligently, and keeping their skin clean and dry. If you want to use medicine, here are a few prescriptions: 1. Wash the armpit area with a 3% tannic acid solution two or three times a day, and apply some prickly heat powder after the medicine dries. 2. Take a small amount of alum, burn it with fire, grind it into a fine powder, and apply it to the armpit two or three times a day, and the odor will be absorbed. However, do not use too much force when applying, and do not apply too much medicine. After applying it once, wash the armpit with warm water before applying it the next time. 3. Take two mace of Chinese herbal medicine Sanxiandan, three mace of cloves, and five mace of gypsum, dry them in the sun, grind them into a fine powder, put them in a bottle, and apply a small amount to the armpit when using, which can eliminate the odor. Each application can last for five or six days, and the effect is very good. If the body odor is severe and none of these prescriptions work, you can go to the hospital to have it surgically removed when the weather is cool. (Anquan)

    怎样治狐臭？
    狐臭的发生与人的体质有关，原因是腋窝皮肤里的大汗腺分泌多，或者是分泌不正常，就发出狐臭来。在夏天因为出汗多，臭气就更大些。这种汗腺在青春发育时期才开始分泌，一般到了成年的时候会减轻一些，到了老年会萎缩。所以，青年人狐臭的比较多，到成年时会减轻些，到老年时还可能自己消除。狐臭有遗传性，但不会传染别人，对于自己身体健康也没有影响，仅是气味不大好闻。
    有狐臭的人，经常洗澡，勤换衣服，并保持皮肤的清洁干燥，就可以使气味减轻些。如果要用药，这里有几个方子：一、用3％的鞣酸（单宁酸）溶液洗涤腋窝处，每天二、三次，等药干后搽上一些痱子粉。二、取少量明矾，用火烧一下，研成细粉末，每天搽腋窝二、三次，臭气就会被吸去。不过搽时不要过分用力，药也不要搽得太多，搽过一次后下次搽时应该先用温清水洗洁腋窝。三、用中药三仙丹二钱，公丁香三钱，生石膏五钱，放在太阳下晒干，一起研成细末装到瓶里，用时搽少许在腋窝处，可使气味消除。每搽一次，可保持五、六天，效果很好。如果狐臭利害，这几个方子都不见效，可以在气候阴凉时到医院开刀割除。（安全）
