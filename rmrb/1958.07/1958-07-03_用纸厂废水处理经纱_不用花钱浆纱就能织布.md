According to the "Liberation Daily" report: The Second Cloth Machine Workshop of the Shanghai State-Owned No. 15 Cotton Mill has successfully experimented with using wastewater from paper mills to treat warp yarn. This further develops the creation by the Shanghai State-Owned No. 14 Cotton Mill of completely eliminating the sizing process by using the chemical raw material carboxymethyl cellulose to treat warp yarn. It has far greater economic significance than using carboxymethyl cellulose to treat warp yarn, and is a major technological revolution in the textile industry.

Paper mill wastewater contains a large amount of xylan pulp. The economic value and advantages of using xylan pulp to treat warp yarn far exceed those of using "carboxymethyl cellulose." This wastewater originally flowed into the Huangpu River, but now it can be directly used to treat warp yarn without adding any chemical raw materials or any treatment. Therefore, it can not only greatly save industrial grain and other materials needed for the sizing process, but also has an abundant source that is almost inexhaustible. Currently, the price of carboxymethyl cellulose is 15 yuan per kilogram, which can treat 900 meters of warp yarn, while this wastewater only needs to be transported from the paper mill, and each kilogram of wastewater can treat 200 meters of warp yarn. This is equivalent to fundamentally eliminating the cost incurred by sizing. The No. 15 Cotton Mill alone can save 7,200 bags of flour throughout the year, as well as several thousand kilograms of water glass, talc, and tallow.

Using xylan pulp to treat warp yarn also has many other advantages: it is not easily deteriorated by acids or alkalis; its stability, permeability, and adhesion are stronger than those of flour; the warp yarn has good strength, which can reduce yarn breakage, and the warp yarn is not prone to fuzzing; high temperatures are not required, so water radiators do not need to be turned on even in winter, and spraying is not necessary, so the problems of the workshop being stuffy, humid, and dirty can be fundamentally solved; when the woven cloth is sent to the dyeing factory for printing and dyeing, a desizing process can be reduced, thereby reducing the labor intensity and cost of the dyeing factory; the printed calico is more vivid and eye-catching than flour-sized cloth; its operation method is extremely simple, and it can be used immediately or stored for a period of time before use, and it is non-toxic and odorless.

This great initiative was successfully achieved by the workers of the No. 15 Cotton Mill and the Tianzhang Paper Mill after a week of hard work and experimentation.

    用纸厂废水处理经纱
    不用花钱浆纱就能织布
    据解放日报报道：上海国棉十五厂第二布机车间试验成功用造纸厂的废水处理经纱，把上海国棉十四厂根本废除浆纱工序，利用化学原料羧基甲基纤维素处理经纱的创造进一步发展了。它比利用羧基甲基纤维素处理经纱具有更巨大的经济意义，这是纺织工业技术上的一次大革新。
    造纸废水中含有大量的木醣浆。用木醣浆处理经纱的经济价值和优点远远超过用“羧基甲基纤维素”。这种废水原来是流入黄浦江去的，现在可以不加任何化学原料，不经过任何处理就可直接拿来处理经纱。所以不但可以大大节省工业用粮和其他浆纱工序所需的用料，而且来源丰富几乎是取之不尽，用之不竭。目前羧基甲基纤维素的价格是每公斤十五元，可以处理九百公尺经纱，而这种废水只需到造纸厂去搬运就可，每公斤废水可处理二百公尺经纱。等于从根本上取消了因浆纱而所耗的成本。单国棉十五厂全年就可节省面粉七千二百包，以及水玻璃、滑石粉、牛油等几千公斤。
    利用木醣浆处理经纱还有其他很多优点：它遇到酸、碱不易变质；它的稳定性、渗透性和粘着性都比面粉强；经纱强力好，可以减少断头，经纱不易起毛；不需高温，即使在冬天也可不开水汀，不需要喷雾，车间闷、湿、脏的问题可根本解决；织成的布送到印染厂去印染时可以减少一道退浆工序，从而可以减少印染厂的劳动强度和成本；印出的花布比面粉上浆的更加鲜艳夺目；它的操作方法极简单，还可以随取随用或放一个时期再用，并且无毒，无气味。
    这个巨大的创举是十五厂和天章造纸厂的职工经过一星期的苦干试验成功的。
