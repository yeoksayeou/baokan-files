    Dulles's Sorrow

    On the afternoon of the 26th, Dulles arrived at the Bonn airport in pouring rain. As Adenauer stepped forward to shield Dulles with his umbrella, he said meaningfully to Dulles, "I am now going to protect America."

    How could Adenauer, who began to grow fat under the wings of the United States and is still "protected" by the bayonets of the American occupation forces, suddenly become America's "protector"? The reason is not difficult to understand. The United States is currently unprecedentedly isolated and besieged on all sides around the world. Its armed aggression against Lebanon has been unanimously condemned by world opinion. Within the imperialist camp, the United States's arbitrary actions in the Near and Middle East have also caused dissatisfaction among some of its allies, including West Germany. Dulles's special trip to Bonn to meet with Adenauer was also intended to have Adenauer help him alleviate the dissatisfaction of the allies and support the American aggression in the Middle East.

    Therefore, Dulles's situation in Bonn this time was very unfavorable; he was almost an empty-handed supplicant. This, of course, provided Adenauer with an opportunity to exploit, giving him the capital to engage in extortion. So Adenauer cocked his tail and proudly proclaimed himself America's "protector."

    This is the sorrow of the American imperialism, abandoned by its followers, and also the essence of the so-called "interdependence" between imperialist countries.

    杜勒斯的悲哀
    26日下午，杜勒斯在倾盆大雨中抵达波恩机场。当阿登纳上前用他的伞给杜勒斯挡雨时，他意味深长地对杜勒斯说：“我现在要让美国受我的保护”。
    在美国卵翼下开始羽毛丰满起来的、并且至今还在美国占领军的刺刀“保护”下的阿登纳，怎么竟然会充当起美国的“保护”者来了？　事情也不难了解。美国目前在全世界真可说是空前孤立、四面楚歌。它对黎巴嫩的武装侵略遭到全世界舆论的一致的谴责。而在帝国主义阵营内，由于美国在中近东的独断独行也使它的一些盟国，包括西德在内都心怀不满。杜勒斯这次特别到波恩跟阿登纳会谈也为的是要阿登纳帮他一手，消除盟国的不满，并且支持美国在中东的侵略行动。
    所以杜勒斯这次到波恩来的处境十分不利，他几乎是两手空空的求助者。这对阿登纳来说当然是有机可乘，有了敲竹杠的资本。于是阿登纳就翘起尾巴神气十足地自命为美国的“保护”者了。
    这是众叛亲离的美帝国主义的悲哀，也是帝国主义国家之间所谓“相互依赖”的实质。
