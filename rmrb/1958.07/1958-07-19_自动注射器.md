    Automatic Injector
    Nurses in the Department of Internal Medicine of a Guangzhou-based military hospital have modified the currently used syringe into an "automatic injector," which can improve the efficiency of injections. In the past, injecting 50 milliliters of glucose, including skin disinfection and other procedures, took 20 minutes. Now, using the automatic injector, one only needs to insert the needle of the syringe filled with medication into the patient's vein, and then attach the "automatic device" onto the syringe. Using its pressure instead of manual force, the medication can be slowly pushed into the blood vessel. One nurse can inject four patients continuously. In the past, human force was used to draw the medicine into the syringe; now, air pressure is used instead, allowing the medicine to automatically flow into the syringe. This method improves work efficiency by more than threefold compared to the past.

    自动注射器
    驻广州部队医院内科护士把目前使用的注射器改装为“自动注射器”，可以提高打针的工作效率。过去注射五十毫升葡萄糖，包括皮肤消毒等操作要用二十分钟。现在使用自动注射器，只要把吸满药物的注射器针头刺入病人静脉，然后将装置在注射器上的“自动装置”安上，用它的压力代替人力，就可以使药物慢慢地推进血管。一个护士可以连续为四个病人注射。过去是用人力将药物吸入注射器，现在也改用空气压力，使药物自动流入注射器内。这种方法比过去提高工作效率三倍多。
