Rely on the Masses to Use Indigenous Methods to Produce High-Quality Fertilizer
Qingxu County Uses Brine to Make Fertilizer, Annual Output Enough to Apply 100 Jin Per Mu
Lingling County Produces Ammonium Sulfate and Chalk Ammonium, Nitrogen Content Exceeds Similar British Fertilizers

(According to Shanxi Daily) The staff of the Qingxu County Chemical Industry Cooperative have recently created a rare miracle in the country—using indigenous methods to extract several chemical industrial raw materials such as potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, and calcium chloride from brine, and successfully trial-produced chemical fertilizers and mixed fertilizers using these raw materials. This chemical fertilizer, after testing and identification by the Provincial Agricultural Research Institute and Taiyuan Chemical Raw Materials Company, has a very high fertilizer efficiency, the same as the effectiveness of chemical fertilizers produced by modern scientific methods, each jin can replace seventeen jin of human or animal manure, and can increase grain production by two to three jin.

Qingxu County has a lot of alkaline land, and saltpeter soil is everywhere. For many years, farmers in many villages in this county have used the saltpeter soil of alkaline land to produce brine, saltpeter and crude salt. But no one had ever thought of extracting other fertilizer raw materials from brine. Inspired by the Party's general line for socialist construction, the minds of the staff of the Chemical Industry Cooperative were greatly liberated. They thought: "Since brine can be used as fertilizer on the land, it must contain fertilizer ingredients, why can't we make a point of it from this?" But what exactly does brine contain, and how can it be extracted? They didn't know. Just then, a purchasing agent from the Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative happened to come to Qingxu County to purchase chemical industrial raw materials such as potassium chloride and magnesium chloride. They asked the purchasing agent: "Where can potassium chloride be found?" The purchasing agent said: "It can be extracted from brine." This statement greatly inspired them, so they took the initiative to consult the purchasing agent, and went out to visit and seek teachers, actively starting research. They first took the raw materials to the Taiyuan Chemical Raw Materials Company for testing, which confirmed that it contained 88% magnesium chloride, and at the same time learned that if it could be increased to 96%, it could meet export standards. This test encouraged their confidence, and they immediately sent people to the Tianjin Xinsheng Chemical Plant for a visit. There they initially learned the extraction method and learned how to make calcium chloride. Zhang Dianwen, a young cooperative member with a junior high school education, also read some technical materials from relevant books and magazines. Thus, they began experiments. After repeated and bold experiments, they finally successfully trial-produced four chemical raw materials—potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, and potassium sulfate. And using these raw materials, they also trial-produced chemical fertilizers and mixed fertilizers. Among them, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, and calcium chloride are all extracted from brine, and potassium sulfate is extracted from plant ash.

The on-site trial of this indigenously made fertilizer showed good results, its effectiveness is more than sixteen times higher than that of horse manure and human manure.

The sources of these fertilizer raw materials are wide, the investment is small, and the technical equipment is simple. Only a few iron pots, a few large urns or wooden barrels are needed, and only five to eight people can set up an indigenous fertilizer factory with a daily output of three to five tons. The cost of fertilizer produced by it is only more than nine cents per jin.

The Qingxu County Party Committee has decided that, in addition to some mountainous areas, every township in the county should set up fertilizer plants, and every cooperative should set up brine plants, with cooperative plants supplying raw materials and township plants processing. The county will build a larger medium-sized chemical fertilizer plant, each township will build a medium-sized chemical fertilizer plant, and the cooperatives will build fertilizer mixing plants. A total of eleven medium-sized chemical fertilizer plants and one hundred and twenty small fertilizer mixing plants will be built in the county. Each medium-sized chemical fertilizer plant can produce three tons of fertilizer per day, plus the mixing of the small plants, the county can produce 25,000 tons per year. The fifty thousand mu of land in the county can be fertilized with an average of 100 jin per mu. Calculated at an increase of three jin of grain per jin of fertilizer, a total of 150 million jin of grain can be increased, which can feed 400,000 people for a year. This can greatly accelerate the speed of agricultural production increase and rapidly change the backwardness of agricultural production in the county.

(According to New Hunan Daily) Lingling County, Hunan, recently successfully trial-produced chemical fertilizers ammonium sulfate and chalk ammonium using indigenous methods, which were praised by Zhou Xiaozhou, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee.

These two kinds of fertilizers were trial-produced under the personal leadership of Comrade Zhou Nianzheng, Deputy Secretary of the Lingling County Party Committee, by Chen Zhenguo, Minister of the Organization Department of the County Party Committee, Wu Kaizhi, Deputy Minister of the Industry and Communications Department, Chen Changgu of the Fourth Middle School, Yang Meixiang, a chemistry teacher at Lingling Normal School, and more than 30 people from the Agriculture Bureau, the First Middle School, the Bus Station and other units after three days of hard work. According to preliminary tests, the nitrogen content is about 20%, which exceeds the level of 15.5% nitrogen contained in similar British fertilizers.

The manufacturing process of these two chemical fertilizers is not complicated. The main raw material is bituminous coal. The manufacturing method of ammonium sulfate is: put the bituminous coal into a boiler or kiln and seal it with a catheter. A cooling device is installed in the middle of the catheter. When heated to about 1200 to 1800 degrees, ammonia water will flow out of the catheter. Add alum (ferrous ammonium sulfate) or gypsum (calcium sulfate) to the ammonia water, filter it, and evaporate the water to become ammonium sulfate.

The manufacturing method of chalk ammonium is: seal the bituminous coal in an earthen kiln, install a catheter on the top of the kiln, install a water tank in the middle for cooling, and then install a bamboo tube at the end of the catheter to lead to the place where chalk soil is placed (that is, white clay used for making bowls or other mud can also be used, the soil should not be too wet or too dry). When the bituminous coal in the kiln is heated to about 1200 to 1800 degrees, it will emit gas. After intermediate cooling, part of it is coal tar that flows out of the tube, and the other part is ammonia gas that goes directly through the bamboo tube to the chalk soil, and combines with the carbon dioxide gas emitted from the heating place at the bottom of the kiln and goes straight to the chimney to the chalk soil, and becomes chalk ammonium. At the bottom of the kiln heating place, in order to make it emit carbon dioxide gas, a few pieces of limestone are put in together when putting coal to burn. (See attached diagram) This achieves multiple goals in one fell swoop. While producing chalk ammonium, by-products such as coal tar, coke, and lime can also be obtained.

When Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, inspected work in Hengyang, he invited comrades from Lingling County to report on the trial production situation, greatly praised their noble communist style of daring to think, daring to speak and daring to do, and pointed out that the method of producing chalk ammonium is relatively simple in terms of technology and equipment. It is most suitable for mass production in the vast rural areas and should be vigorously promoted immediately.

    依靠群众用土法制优质化肥
    清徐县用卤水制化肥年产量每亩地能施一百斤
    零陵县制出硫酸铵和白垩铵含氮量超过英国同类肥料
    据山西日报讯　清徐县化学工业社的职工，最近创造了一项全国罕有的奇迹——用土办法从卤水中提炼出了氯化钾、氯化镁和氯化钙等几种化学工业的原料，并用这些原料试制成功化学肥料和混合化肥。这种化学肥料经省农业研究所和太原化工原料公司化验鉴定，肥效很高，与用现代科学方法生产出的化肥的效能一样，每斤能顶十七斤人粪或畜粪，能增产二至三斤粮食。
    清徐县的碱地很多，硝土到处皆有。若干年来，这个县很多村庄的农民就利用碱地的硝土生产卤水、火硝和土盐。但是从未有人想过从卤水中再提炼别的化肥原料。化学工业社的职工，在党的社会主义建设总路线的启发下，思想大大解放，他们想：“既然卤水能当作肥料上地，里面必定含有化肥的成份，为什么我们不能从这上边打点主意呢？”但是卤水里究竟含有些什么，怎样才能把它提炼出来，他们却不知道。正在这时，凑巧有湖南省供销社的一个采购员到清徐县采购氯化钾、氯化镁等化学工业原料。他们便问采购员：“氯化钾哪里有呢？”那个采购员讲道：“卤水里就可以提炼出来。”这一说使他们受到很大启发，于是便主动地向采购员请教，又四出访问、投师，积极着手进行研究。他们首先拿上原料请太原化工原料公司作化验，肯定了里面含氯化镁88％，同时又得知如果能够提高到96％，就可达到出口标准。这次化验鼓舞了他们的信心，马上又派人到天津新生化工厂进行参观。在那里他们初步学会了提炼办法，学会了制造氯化钙。一个高小文化程度的青年社员张殿文又从有关书籍、杂志上看了些技术资料，这样他们开始了试验，经过他们一次又一次地大胆试验，终于试制成功了四种化学原料——氯化钾、氯化镁、氯化钙和硫酸钾。并利用这些原料又试制成了化学肥料和混合肥料。其中氯化钾、氯化镁、氯化钙都是由卤水中提炼出来的，硫酸钾是由植物灰中提炼出来的。
    这种土制化肥经实地试验效果良好，它比马粪和人粪的效能要高十六倍之多。
    这些化肥原料来源很广，投资少，技术设备简单，只需要几口铁锅、几个大瓮或木桶，只要五至八人就能办起一个日产三至五吨土化肥工厂，它所产的化肥造价每斤只需要九分多钱。
    中共清徐县委已经作出决定，除一部分山地外，全县乡乡办化肥厂，社社办卤水厂，社厂供原料，乡厂搞加工。县建一个较大的中型化工厂，每乡建一个中型化工厂，社建化肥配制厂，全县共建中型化肥厂十一个、小型化肥配制厂一百二十个。每个中型化肥厂每日可产化肥三吨，再加上小型厂的配制，全县全年可产两万五千吨，全县五十万亩土地平均每亩可施化肥一百斤，按每斤增产粮食三斤计算，共可增产粮食一亿五千万斤，可供四十万人吃一年。这样便可以大大加快农业增产的速度，迅速地改变全县农业生产的落后面貌。
    据新湖南报讯　湖南零陵县最近用土办法试制成功化学肥料硫酸铵和白垩铵，受到湖南省委第一书记周小舟的赞扬。
    这两种化肥是在中共零陵县委副书记周年政同志亲自领导下，由县委组织部部长陈振国、工交部副部长吴开智、第四中学陈厂谷、零陵师范化学教师杨梅香，以及农业局、第一中学、汽车站等单位共三十余人经过三天的苦战，试制成功的。经过初步化验，含氮量约20％左右，均超过了英国的同类肥料所含氮15.5％的水平。
    这两种化学肥料的制造过程并不复杂，主要原料都是烟煤。硫酸铵的制造方法是：把烟煤用锅炉或窑内密封装上导管，导管中间装一冷却设备，加热到一千二百至一千八百度左右，便会从导管内流出氨水，将氨水加上青矾（硫酸錏铁）或石膏（硫酸钙），经过过滤，将水份蒸发后便成为硫酸铵。
    白垩铵的制造方法是：在土窑内装上烟煤密封，窑顶装上导管，中间装一水槽作冷却用，导管尾部再装一竹管引至放白垩土（即做碗用的白泥或其他泥也可以，土不宜过湿，亦不宜过干）的地方。窑内烟煤被加热到一千二百至一千八百度左右时，便发出气体，经中间冷却，一部分为煤焦油由管内流出，另一部分氨气则由竹管直通到白垩土，与窑底加热处发出的碳酸气直通烟囱到白垩土处相结合，则成为白垩铵。窑底加热处为了要使其发出碳酸气，在放煤时同时放上几块石灰石一起烧。（如附图）这样便一举几得，在生产白垩铵的同时，还可取煤焦油、焦炭、石灰等副产品。
    中共湖南省委第一书记周小舟同志到衡阳视察工作时，邀请了零陵县的同志来汇报试制情况，大大地赞扬了他们这种敢想敢说敢做的共产主义高尚风格，并指出，生产白垩铵的方法，在技术上、设备上比较简单，最适合广大农村大量生产，应立即大力推广。
