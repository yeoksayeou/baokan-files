Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 14th. The large-scale plain reservoir, the Taihangdi Reservoir in Heze, Shandong, is basically completed.

The reservoir has a total area of 250 square kilometers and can store 950 million cubic meters of water, which is almost equivalent to digging two Dongping Lakes on flat ground. According to the engineers in charge of the design, at the normal speed in the past, the survey and design of such a large reservoir would take three years and cost several hundred million yuan. However, this reservoir was built by mobilizing and relying on the masses. The design started in late March this year, and full-scale construction began in early April. The total earthwork reached more than 41.31 million cubic meters. According to statistics on July 5th, more than 34.89 million cubic meters had been completed. At present, more than 100,000 migrant workers are working day and night on the construction site to complete the final project. The state investment is only 10 million yuan.

The location of this reservoir is very suitable. The south side uses the original levee of the old Xianfeng course of the Yellow River; the terrain is high in the south and low in the north, which can be irrigated by gravity flow. After diverting 188 cubic meters per second of Yellow River water from Sanyizhai, Henan, into the reservoir, as long as its six gates are opened, the settled and clarified water can flow to the eight million mu of farmland in Caoxian, Dingtao, Chengwu, Juye, Heze, and Shanxian through a series of gravity irrigation systems. It is estimated that improving water conservancy conditions alone can increase grain production by 2.5 billion to 3 billion catties per year.

This reservoir can store water for irrigation in August.

### 太行堤水库下月蓄水  水库顶得上两个东平湖

    太行堤水库下月蓄水
    水库顶得上两个东平湖
    据新华社济南14日电　大型平原水库山东菏泽太行堤水库基本完工。
    这座水库总面积二百五十平方公里，能蓄水九点五亿公方，几乎等于平地挖起两个东平湖。据负责设计的工程师谈，要按过去平常速度，这种大型水库光勘察设计就要三年，投资要几亿元。而这座水库发动群众、依靠群众来修，今年3月下旬设计，4月上旬全面施工，全部土方达四千一百三十一万多公方，到7月5日统计，就已完成三千四百八十九万多公方。目前仍有十多万民工在工地上日夜突击最后的工程。国家投资只有一千万元。
    这个水库的地址选择得十分适宜，南边是利用黄河咸丰故道的原有大堤；地势是南高北低，可以自流灌溉。自河南三义寨引黄河水一百八十八个秒公方入库后，只要将它的六个闸门打开，经沉淀而澄清的水就可以通过一系列的自流灌溉系统，流往曹县、定陶、城武、巨野、菏泽、单县的八百万亩农田。预计仅改善水利条件一项，每年就可以增产粮食二十五亿到三十亿斤。
    这座水库8月份就可以蓄水灌溉。
