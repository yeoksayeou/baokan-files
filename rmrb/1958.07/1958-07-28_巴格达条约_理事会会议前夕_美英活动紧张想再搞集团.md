Xinhua News Agency, London, July 27th: On the eve of the "Baghdad Pact" Council meeting scheduled for the 28th, tense diplomatic activities have begun in London.

Following the meeting between the foreign ministers of Britain and Iran on the morning of the 26th, US Secretary of State Dulles and British Prime Minister Macmillan held secret talks this morning. Dulles arrived in London on the evening of the 26th. They are also scheduled to hold discussions tonight with the heads of government of the three remaining Middle Eastern members of the treaty.

Since the Iraqi revolution broke the back of this imperialist tool of aggression in the Middle East, the United States and Britain are trying to hold together the three remaining members of the treaty, continuing to use them as tools for US and British aggression in the Middle East. Therefore, the question of the "future" of the Baghdad Pact will be the main content of this meeting. News has it that Dulles is considering organizing "some new form of anti-communist alliance" in the Middle East, in order to fill the gap in the Baghdad Pact caused by the "unexpected loss of Iraq as a member." Britain is also planning "some organization that can strengthen or replace the Baghdad Pact alliance" with US support.

It is also revealed that Dulles will also discuss the issue of a summit meeting within the United Nations Security Council with British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Lloyd while in London. Outside the meeting, Macmillan will also discuss the Cyprus issue with Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, as the atmosphere between Britain and Turkey has recently become "more tense."

According to Reuters, due to the "importance and urgency" of the issues discussed at this meeting, the meeting will be "more secret" than originally planned, and the number of officials accompanying the prime ministers of each member country will be smaller.

     “巴格达条约”理事会会议前夕
    美英活动紧张想再搞集团
    新华社27日讯　伦敦消息：在“巴格达条约”理事会将在28日举行会议的前夕，伦敦开始了紧张的外交活动。
    继英国和伊朗的外交大臣在26日上午会谈后，美国国务卿杜勒斯和英国首相麦克米伦今天上午举行了密谈。杜勒斯是在26日晚上到达伦敦的。他们还预定在今天晚上同这个条约的中东三个残余成员国的政府首脑举行商谈。
    由于伊拉克革命打断了帝国主义在中东的这个侵略工具的脊骨，因此，美国和英国力图把这个条约的三个残余成员国捏在一起，继续利用它们作为美英的侵略中东的工具。因此，关于巴格达条约的“前途”问题将是这次会议的主要内容。有消息说，杜勒斯正在考虑在中东组织“某种新形式的反共联盟”，借以填补巴格达条约中由于“出乎意外地丧失了伊拉克这样一个成员国而出现的缺口”。英国也在筹划在美国支持下的“某种能够加强或替代巴格达条约联盟的组织”。
    另据透露，杜勒斯在伦敦时也将同英国首相麦克米伦和外交大臣劳埃德讨论在联合国安全理事会内举行的政府首脑会议问题。在会外，麦克米伦也将同土耳其总理曼德列斯讨论塞浦路斯问题，因为英国和土耳其之间的气氛最近已“更加紧张”。
    据路透社报道，由于这次会议讨论的问题的“重要性和迫切性”，这次会议将比原定计划“更加秘密”，随同各成员国总理参加的官员人数将更少。
