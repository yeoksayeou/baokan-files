Flax, as referred to here, is oil flax. Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and parts of Shanxi, northern Hebei, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Shaanxi provinces all produce flax. Inner Mongolia has the highest output, ranking first in the country.

Flax seeds are rich in fat, with an oil yield generally between 32% and 37%. The oil can be used for cooking and lighting; because it is a drying oil, it is also an excellent raw material for paint. After the oil is extracted, the flaxseed cake can be used as feed and fertilizer. Flax stalks can be retted for fiber, yielding about ten jin of fiber per hundred jin of stalks. Flax stalks are a very large fiber resource. It is estimated that if all existing flax stalks were utilized, they could meet the raw material needs of twenty factories as large as the Harbin Flax Factory.

Due to crude cultivation techniques, the unit yield of flax in many regions is very low. According to statistics from the past two years, the national average yield is only forty or fifty jin, with low-yielding areas only producing ten or twenty jin. In recent years, some regions have rapidly increased unit yields with the improvement of cultivation techniques. In Datong and Zuoyun, Shanxi, some production units have more than doubled their yields in one year. In 1957, the 4.48 mu of flax of the Yongsheng Cooperative in Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia, averaged 408.4 jin per mu. However, the highest record for flax was in Jiuquan, Gansu. Last year, the average yield of more than 26,000 mu of flax in this county was 140 jin per mu, with high-yielding fields producing more than 500 jin per mu.

Flax has the characteristics of being cold-resistant and early-maturing. Flax seeds can germinate and grow at 2-3 degrees Celsius. In China's flax-producing areas, flax is generally sown in mid-April, when the ground temperature is generally around 10 degrees Celsius. Flax generally matures in about ninety days, and some varieties mature in eighty days.

"Big Head Flax," "Yanong No. 1," and "Wuhe Lin Soviet Variety" are famous flax varieties. "Wuhe Lin Soviet Variety" is an oil and fiber dual-purpose variety introduced from the Soviet Union. In the Pingdiquan area of Inner Mongolia, it yields 20% more than local varieties and can also produce two to three hundred jin of good fiber flax stalks. The economic benefits per unit area of planting this type of flax are relatively large.

    胡麻
    这里所指的胡麻就是油用亚麻。内蒙古、甘肃和山西、河北北部以及新疆、青海、陕西等省区的部分地区都产胡麻。其中以内蒙古产量最多，占全国第一位。
    胡麻种子含有丰富脂肪，出油率一般在32％—37％。油能吃也能点灯；因为它是干性油，所以是很好的油漆原料。榨油以后的胡麻饼可作饲料、肥料；胡麻秆可沤制纤维，一百斤可出十斤左右。胡麻秆是一项数量极大的纤维资源，据计算，如果把现有的胡麻秆全部利用起来，就可以满足像哈尔滨亚麻厂那样大的二十座工厂所需要的原料。
    由于耕作技术的粗放，许多地区的胡麻单位产量很低，根据前二年的统计，全国平均产量仅四、五十斤，低产的只有一、二十斤。近年来，有些地区随着耕作技术的改进，单位产量迅速提高了。山西大同、左云等地一些生产单位，在一年内提高产量一倍以上。1957年内蒙古五原县永胜社的四点四八亩胡麻，平均亩产四百零八点四斤。但是，胡麻的最高的纪录出在甘肃酒泉，去年，这个县二万六千多亩胡麻平均亩产一百四十斤，丰产田亩产五百多斤。
    胡麻具有耐寒和成熟早的特点。胡麻种子在摄氏二、三度就能发芽生长。我国胡麻产区一般在4月中旬就播种胡麻，那时的地温一般是摄氏十度左右。胡麻一般约九十天成熟，也有八十天成熟的品种。
    “大头胡麻”“雁农一号”“五河林苏联种”是著名的胡麻品种。“五河林苏联种”是由苏联引进的油脂、纤维兼用品种。它在内蒙古平地泉地区，较当地品种增产20％，另外还能收纤维很好的麻茎二、三百斤。种这种胡麻的单位面积经济收益是比较大的。
