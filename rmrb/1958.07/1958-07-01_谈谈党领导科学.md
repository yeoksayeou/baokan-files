When the bourgeois rightists were frantically attacking the Party, the rightists in the scientific community clamored that "small intellectuals cannot lead large intellectuals," and "laymen cannot lead experts." At the same time, many intellectuals sympathized with the rightist arguments, saying that "in principle, the Party can lead, but there are difficulties at present." Some also said, "Whether it can lead depends on the specific situation of the Party leaders." In the end, it still boiled down to "cannot lead." The difference was that the rightists sincerely wanted to usurp the Party's leadership and serve the bourgeoisie, while some intellectuals saw themselves as superior, "only I am capable" special individuals, and simply looked down on the proletariat. After the debate, after the rightists' conspiracy was exposed, people woke up. The great achievements of construction in the past eight or nine years are iron proof that the Party can lead everything. Science is a part of the socialist cause, and past achievements were obtained under the leadership of the Party, and in the future, it must also be led by the Party. People also realized that bourgeois individualism is incompatible with this society, and without transformation, there is a danger of becoming a rightist. The anti-rightist struggle was a profound socialist education for intellectuals. However, because the bourgeois ideology of intellectuals was not thoroughly criticized and clarified in time, their recognition of the Party's leadership of science was only viewed from a political perspective. In order to adapt to society and learn politics, people thought that they should accept the Party's leadership. When it comes to the Party's ability to lead in professional work, people are not sincerely convinced. Apart from administrative management and scientific organization work, they still do not believe that the Party can lead in issues such as professional direction, planning, and academics. If they say it can lead, it is only a "way of saying" it. From this, the conclusion is drawn: "I will listen to you in politics, and you will listen to me in professional work." This statement reflects a mistaken view: that politics and professional work, red and expert, are divided and opposed in the individual's ideological realm, as if there is no connection. This is the so-called political support for socialism and striving to join the Party is one thing, and whether professional work is in line with the socialist line and whether it is correct or not is another; it seems that political thought does not affect specific professional work. This divided view was not an isolated phenomenon before the rectification movement, and even some Party member scientists were no exception. Some Party member scientists regarded themselves as scientists within the Party and wanted to lead the Party, while outside the Party, they styled themselves as politicians and wanted to lead scientists. Through the double-anti movement, many intellectuals have further realized the possibility and necessity of the Party leading scientific research. This ideological leap has promoted the great leap forward of scientific work in our country. However, there are still many people who are unclear about these issues, and it is still necessary to further clarify those erroneous ideas.

Some people, due to their erroneous views, hinder the correct understanding of problems and intentionally or unintentionally resist the Party's leadership over scientific work; they want "political guarantee of professional work" but are unwilling to have "professional work subordinate to politics." In essence, this is wanting the Party to serve the individual, rather than scientists serving the people. Many scientists have not resolved the issues of who science serves, how it serves, and what attitude to take towards the socialist cause. To criticize the argument that the Party cannot lead scientific work, it is first necessary to clarify the relationship between politics and professional work. Whether politics is in command can be clearly seen from the large number of facts exposed in the in-depth rectification of scientists' self-transformation, which show the harm and impact of bourgeois ideology on professional work. This all proves that politics must be in command. It is necessary to establish a clear red flag of command in everyone's mind. Politics and professional work are inseparable in a person's ideological activities. The specific appearance of a scientist's political thought is often reflected in their professional performance. Without correct political thought, it is difficult to have healthy professional performance. In the past few years, the Party has fully valued scientific research, which has greatly developed scientific work. The Party has led scientists to carry out ideological transformation, the Party has led scientists to connect with reality and the masses, and the Party has led scientists to formulate a twelve-year plan for scientific development. It is precisely under the correct leadership of the Party that the ideology of scientific workers and the cause of scientific research have made today's progress. Today, it is not that the Party's ideological transformation of scientific workers is too tight, but that the Party should pay more attention to the ideological transformation of scientific workers; it is not that the Party manages science too much, but that the Party's leadership of the scientific cause should be greatly strengthened. Only when the Party grasps the key of political thought can it guide the direction of professional work, work plans, implementation paths, and cadre training to the correct direction through the consciousness of scientists. In bourgeois society, scientists never thought about who would lead this issue, because in the past, the political thoughts of the leaders and the led were in harmony. It can be seen that the focus of the problem is not whether it can be led, but whether it is willing to accept leadership. Accepting transformation will enable you to appreciate that the Party can lead. Not accepting transformation will inevitably lead to superficial agreement and inner disagreement.

The in-depth rectification movement has clarified this issue for many ideologically progressive intellectuals. As a red expert, you must have a red heart, and do what the country needs. Do what the people demand. Link your heart with the hearts of the people, combine your work with the demands of the people, and dare to resolutely negate the direction and plans formulated from an individualistic perspective. When necessary, in order to rapidly develop a certain scientific research that the country urgently needs, also dare to abandon research methods that have been familiar for many years but cannot solve the essence of the problem, and change the path and start from scratch. Although this is painful temporarily, it is pleasant afterwards. After this transformation, professional activities will be guided by new political thoughts, and politics and professional work will change from opposition to unity, and the command and tools will be distinguished in order of priority. When scientists are truly of one heart with the Party, they will realize that the Party's criticism of their incorrect professional performance is correct, and the so-called argument that the Party cannot lead professional work will no longer exist.

What should the Party mainly grasp in leading scientific work? This is an issue that must be clarified. Should everything, no matter how trivial, be grasped? Or should there be a distinction between primary and secondary? If even blowing glass tubes and solving equations are required of the Party, it is indeed not possible today, and no scientist outside the field can do it, so this is an unreasonable request. If the Party is required to grasp major issues such as politics, the direction of professional work, professional thought, plans, and what ways to develop science faster, whether from a theoretical point of view or from practical examples, it should be said that the Party can fully lead. It should also be pointed out that in the current socialist great leap forward, the scientific cause must be led by the Party in order to leap forward, and it cannot leap forward without the leadership of the Party.

We are materialists, and everything proceeds from reality. The development of Chinese science cannot be separated from Chinese reality. Serving production is the purpose of science, and it is also an important way to enrich scientific theory. The production practice of socialist construction has put forward many new problems for scientific research work, and through completing tasks, scientific theory will inevitably be enriched. It should be said that this is the fastest way to develop science. Of course, purely theoretical scientific research must also be deeply noted. The twelve-year scientific plan is an example. This is a great and unprecedented initiative that points out a bright future for the development of Chinese science. Only the Communist Party has such magnificent courage, vision, and organizational ability. This is unimaginable in capitalist society. Many scientific research units have solved a series of major professional problems from direction and plans to specific practices in rectification, reviewed the past, and determined the future. Facts have proved that the Party has the ability to grasp the main problems of scientific development. What the Party is required to lead is precisely these problems. Party workers are not right if they only talk about politics and do not grasp professional work; if they grasp professional work and fall into a purely technical circle, picking up sesame seeds and losing watermelons, it is also not right. It is correct to grasp the key of political thought through professional work, and to solve major professional problems with political thought as guidance.

What methods can be used to lead scientific research better? There is indeed no complete set of experience yet, and we must continue to explore. Even so, under the leadership of the Party, the development of the scientific cause has far exceeded the past development speed of old China. Of course, we should not be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. Faced with things that are still unfamiliar, we must earnestly study the problem of what methods and through what channels to lead. In addition to socialist enthusiasm, Communists have two of the most important working weapons: the mass line and materialist dialectics. In the process of social revolution, countless facts have proved that as long as these two weapons are fully used, any difficulty will bow before the Communists, and achievements will be created. In the past few years, on the scientific front, these two universally applicable magic weapons have also played a brilliant role. Today, the masses in the scientific team have been mobilized, and the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism and debate on relevant professional issues has been established among young and old scientific workers. This is a very good phenomenon and must be constantly implemented. With the atmosphere of criticism and debate, there will be opposing opinions, and academics and ideology will develop. At the same time, in different opinions, dialectics will tell us how to find and recognize problems; the debate between opposites will tell us which is advanced and which is backward; what is needed now and what will be needed in the future; which are phenomena and which are essence; which are trivial and which are principles; which are illusory and which are well-founded. That is to say, with the atmosphere of criticism and debate centered on professional work, and with opposing opinions, we can analyze and compare, and choose what everyone thinks is correct and needed in the comparison. We are not afraid of not recognizing the goods, but only afraid of comparing the goods. Although we are not very proficient now, we can also see the problems. It should be emphasized here that our Party does not encourage laymen to draw conclusions lightly on academic and other issues; what we oppose is precisely this practice. Whoever does this will make mistakes. We are saying that Party workers should lead and organize scientific workers to implement the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend on academic and other issues, and promote the development of the scientific cause through debate. Precisely because we do not understand, Party workers need to patiently listen to the different opinions of scientists and protect the growth of different schools of thought. Precisely because of their loyalty and responsibility to the socialist cause, the Party cherishes even the slightest research results of scientists and promotes them to serve production well. Precisely because the Communist Party is the most advanced and far-sighted party, it can always pay attention to the development of new things, support seedlings that are not yet valued, and care about research that does not currently see the value of use. That is to say, even on academic issues that are still unfamiliar to us, as long as the Party's policies are implemented, a new situation will inevitably appear in scientific work, thereby reflecting the leading role. And this role can only be undertaken by the Communist Party. In summary, from political thought to professional direction, scientific planning, implementation methods, cadre training, academic debates, etc., all show that the Party can lead professional work. In addition to this, what else should be led but cannot be led?

In order to lead better, the Party leaders in scientific research institutions should also study hard. Do not be afraid of not understanding, but be afraid of not learning. The more you understand, the more specific, timely, and accurate you can lead. For the cause of the Party, we must work hard, brace ourselves and study hard, and if we study hard for three or five years, we will have a rough understanding. If we are given more time, it is not impossible for some Party workers to become scientists. Science is a kind of knowledge, not a mysterious and unknowable thing. The reason why some people in the past regarded it as mysterious was because some bourgeois scholars rendered it mysterious. On the other hand, in the minds of a few comrades in the Party, the difficulty of science seems to be as difficult as ascending to heaven, so they lack confidence and shrink back; in their work, they are satisfied with empty political leadership and relax their responsibilities in professional work, which is an extremely wrong practice. It should be admitted that it is difficult to study science, but it is by no means unattainable. We should study purposefully, planned, step by step, and systematically. First of all, we must find out the characteristics and research methods of the subject, the achievements and development trends in the world, the existing level in the country and the requirements of the country, the specific purpose and way of research, so as to correctly grasp the policy. With the help of scientists, this is not difficult to do. On this basis, it is necessary to further devote oneself to the scientific and technological team to work hard and study hard, and as long as we study hard, we will get results. We have the ability to overthrow the three great mountains that weigh on the Chinese people, and we have the ability to attack the scientific fortress. This is the spirit that communists should have.

The development of the scientific cause depends on the leadership of the Party, and the complete realization of the Party's leadership lies in the growth of a scientific team that is both red and expert. The Party's leadership should strive to organize this team. Today, this team is changing, breaking bourgeois ideology and establishing socialist ideology, and is formulating individual red and expert plans. Scientific workers, whether young or old, should be determined to transform themselves, change their class stand, attach importance to theoretical study, and master materialist dialectics. Scientific workers who are motivated by the cause of the people will inevitably study faster and become more specialized. It should be emphasized that the issue of accelerating the training of young people. Young people are the successors of the socialist cause, and the red and expert depth of the mentors directly affects the speed of growth of these young soldiers. Therefore, as mentors, we must not only accelerate our own transformation, but also consider how to accelerate the growth of young people in the new situation. Party leaders and administrative leaders must not only be redder in politics, but also patiently, meticulously, and sincerely help scientific workers carry out ideological transformation, and in professional work, they must advance to science with a fighting spirit and learn the skills as soon as possible with the help of scientists. Although the experiences are different, they will eventually converge on the same path. Such a people's scientific team, closely united around the Party, will be invincible and indestructible in the struggle against nature, will rapidly change the face of science, and contribute tremendous strength to socialist construction.

    谈谈党领导科学
    卫一清
    当资产阶级右派分子猖狂向党进攻的时候，科学界的右派分子叫嚣“小知识分子不能领导大知识分子”；“外行不能领导内行”。同时，也有不少知识分子同情右派论调，说什么“原则上党能领导，但是目前有困难”。也有的说：“能不能领导，要看党领导人的具体情况。”说来说去，还是“不能领导”。所不同的，右派分子是诚心篡夺党的领导权，为资产阶级服务；而有些知识分子则是把自己看作超人一等，“唯我才成”的特殊人物，根本看不起无产阶级。经过辩论，揭穿右派的阴谋以后，人们清醒过来了。八、九年来建设的伟大成就就是铁的证明，党能领导一切。科学是社会主义事业的一部分，过去的成就是由党领导取得的，今后也必须由党来领导。人们也体会到资产阶级个人主义和这个社会是格格不入的，不改造，有变成右派的危险。反右派斗争，对知识分子是一次深刻的社会主义教育。但是由于对知识分子的资产阶级思想没有来得及彻底批判、澄清，他们的承认党领导科学是仅从政治角度上看的。为了适应社会，应当学政治，人们因而想应当接受党的领导。说起党能领导业务，人们并不是心悦诚服的，除了行政管理、科学组织工作以外，如业务方向、计划、学术等方面的问题，却还不相信党能领导。如果说能领导，也仅是一种“说法”而已。由此得出结论：“政治我听你的，业务你听我的”。这种说法反映一个错误观点：把政治和业务、红与专在个人思想领域里，分割对立起来，似乎毫无联系。这就是所谓政治上拥护社会主义、争取入党是一回事，业务上对不对社会主义口径、正确与否，是另一回事；似乎政治思想并不影响具体业务。这种分割观点，整风前不是个别现象，甚至有些党员科学家也不例外。有的党员科学家在党内以科学家自居，想来领导党，在党外则以政治家自命，要去领导科学家。经过双反运动，许多知识分子已经进一步认识到党领导科学研究的可能性和必要性。这一思想上的跃进，已促成我国科学工作开始跃进。但是也还有不少人对这些问题认识不清，还有必要再把那些错误思想作进一步的澄清。
    有些人由于观点错误，阻碍了正确地认识问题，有意无意地抗拒着党对科学业务的领导；要“政治保证业务”，而不愿“业务服从政治”。这本质上是要党服务于个人，而不是科学家为人民服务。不少科学家对科学为谁服务，怎样服务，以什么态度对待社会主义事业的问题并没有解决。要批判党不能领导科学业务的论点，首先须阐明政治和业务的关系。政治是否统帅，从深入整风中科学家自我改造所暴露的资产阶级思想对业务工作危害影响的大量事实，可以看得很清楚。这都证明政治必须是统帅。必须在每个人的思想里树立起鲜明的红色帅字旗。政治和业务在一个人的思想活动里，是密不可分的。科学家的政治思想具体面貌，经常地反映在业务表现上。没有正确的政治思想，很难有健康的业务表现。就过去几年来说，党充分重视科学研究，使科学工作得到了很大的发展，党领导科学家进行思想改造，党领导科学家联系实际联系群众，党领导科学家制定科学发展的十二年规划。正是在党的正确领导下，科学工作者的思想和科学研究事业，才有了今天的进展。今天，不是党对科学工作者思想改造抓得过紧了，而是党应当更多地关心科学工作者的思想改造；不是党对科学管得过多了，而是党对科学事业的领导应当大大加强。只有党抓起了政治思想的纲，才会把业务方向、工作计划、贯彻途径以及干部培养等通过科学家的自觉，引到正确方面去。在资产阶级社会里，科学家从来没有想到谁来领导这个问题，这是由于过去领导和被领导间的政治思想是合拍的。由此可见，问题的焦点不是能不能领导，而是愿不愿接受领导。接受改造，就能体会党能领导。不接受改造，必然貌合神离。
    深入的整风运动，使许多思想进步的知识分子澄清了这个问题。作为一个红色专家，必需有一颗红心，国家需要什么，就干什么。人民要求怎样，就怎样。把自己的心和人民的心连成一条，要把自己的工作和人民的要求结合在一起，要敢于坚决地否定从个人主义角度制定的方向、计划，在必要时，为了使国家迫切需要发展的某项科学研究得以迅速发展，也敢于摒弃熟悉多年的但不能解决问题本质的研究方法，而改途易辙，从头学起。这样虽然暂时是痛苦的，但过后是愉快的。经过这番改造，就会以新的政治思想指导业务活动，政治、业务就会由对立变为统一，统帅、工具分了主次。当科学家们真正和党一条心以后，就会认识到党对他们不正确的业务表现上的批评是正确的，所谓党不能领导业务的说法，也就不存在了。
    党领导科学业务，主要应该抓什么，这是必须澄清的一个问题。事无巨细，都要一把抓？还是应该有主次之分？如果连吹玻璃管、解方程式都要求于党，今天确实还不行，任何非本行的科学家也不行，因而这是不合理的要求。如果要党抓政治、抓业务方向、抓业务思想、抓计划以及通过什么途径使科学发展得更快等等重大的问题，无论从道理上讲，从实际事例看，应该说党完全可以来领导。并且应当指出当前社会主义大跃进中，科学事业要跃进，必须由党来领导，离开了党的领导是跃进不起来的。
    我们是唯物主义者，一切从实际出发。中国科学的发展，不能脱离中国的实际。为生产服务是科学的目的，也是丰富科学理论的一条重要途径，社会主义建设的生产实践，给科学研究工作提出了许多新问题，通过完成任务，必然会更丰富科学理论。应该说这是一条最快的发展科学的途径。当然纯理论性的科学研究也必须深切注意。十二年科学规划就是范例，这是史无前例的伟大创举，给中国科学发展指出了光明远景。只有共产党才有这样雄伟的气魄、远见和组织能力，在资本主义社会这是不能想像的。许多科学研究单位在整改中已经从方向、计划到具体作法解决了一系列业务上的重大问题，检查了过去，确定了未来。事实证明，党有能力抓得起科学发展的主要问题。要求党领导的，也正应该是这些问题。党的工作者，如果只空谈政治、不抓业务，固然不对；如果抓业务而陷入纯技术圈子，只拣芝麻，丢掉西瓜，也是不对的。透过业务抓起政治思想之纲，以政治思想作指导，解决业务上的重大问题才是正确的领导。
    用什么方法能把科学研究领导得更好，的确还没有一套完整的经验，必须继续摸索。纵然如此，在党的领导下，科学事业的发展已经远远超过旧中国过去的发展速度。当然我们不应当满足于已有的成就，面对暂时还生疏的东西，必须认真研究用什么方法、通过什么途径去领导的问题。共产党人，除具有社会主义积极性以外，还有两个最重要的工作武器，一是群众路线，一是唯物主义辩证法。在社会革命过程中，无数事实证明，只要充分运用这两个武器，任何困难都会在共产党人面前低头，都会创造出成绩。几年来，在科学战线上，这两个放之四海而皆准的法宝，同样起了光辉的作用。今天科学队伍里的群众发动起来了，有关业务上的批评和自我批评以及辩论的风气，在青年、老年科学工作者之间都树立起来了。这是非常好的现象，必须经常贯彻。有了批评、辩论的风气，就会出现对立的意见，学术、思想会得到发展。同时，在不同的意见里，辩证法会告诉我们，怎样寻找和认识问题；对立面的辩论会告诉我们，那个是先进的，那个是落后的；目前需要什么，将来需要什么；那些是现象，那些是本质；那些是枝节，那些是原则；那些虚无飘渺，那些有根有据。这就是说有了以业务为中心的批评、辩论风气，有了对立的意见，就可以分析、比较，在比较中选择出大家认为是正确的和需要的东西。不怕不识货，只怕货比货。我们现在虽然不很内行，也可以看出问题的。这里应该着重说明一点，我们党并不是鼓励外行在学术性等问题上轻下结论；我们反对的正是这种作法。谁这样做，就会犯错误。我们是说党的工作者应该领导、组织科学工作者贯彻学术等问题上的百家争鸣政策，通过辩论来推动科学事业的发展。正因为不懂，党的工作者才更需要耐心听取科学家的不同意见，保护不同学派的成长。正因为对社会主义事业的忠诚负责，党才会珍惜科学家的那怕是点滴的研究成果，促使它很好地服务于生产。正因为共产党是最先进、最有远见的党，它才能够时刻注意新生事物的发展，扶植暂时还不为人重视的幼苗，关怀目前还看不到使用价值的研究。这就是说，纵然对我们还是陌生的学术性的问题，只要贯彻党的政策，科学工作也必然会出现一个崭新的局面，从而也体现了领导作用。而这个作用也只有共产党才能担当起来。综合上述，从政治思想到业务方向、科学规划、贯彻方法以及干部培养、学术争论等等，都说明党能领导业务。除此以外，还有什么应该领导而不能领导的呢？
    为了更好地领导，科学研究机构中的党的领导人，还应当好好地学习。不怕不懂，就怕不学。越懂的多，就可以领导的越具体越及时越准确。为了党的事业，要下苦功，硬着头皮狠钻，钻个三年五载，就会略知梗概的。若再假以时日，党的某些工作者也不是不可能成为科学家的。科学是一种知识，并不是神秘不可知的东西。过去所以有人把它看成神秘，是由于某些资产阶级学者把它渲染得神秘化了。另一方面，在党内少数同志的思想中，把科学之难，似乎看作难于上青天，因而信心不足，望之却步；工作中满足于空头的政治领导，放松了业务上的责任，这是极其错误的做法。应该承认，钻研科学是有困难的，但绝不是可望而不可即的。我们应该有目的、有计划、有步骤、有系统地进行学习。首先要摸清本学科的特性和研究方法，国际上的成就和发展趋势，国内已有水平和国家要求，研究的具体目的和途径，从而正确地掌握政策。在科学家的帮助下，这是不难作到的。在这个基础上，要进一步置身于科学技术队伍中刻苦钻研，只要钻就会钻出结果。我们有能力推翻压在中国人民头上的三重大山，就有能力攻进科学堡垒。这是共产主义者应有的气魄。
    科学事业的发展，决定于党的领导，而完完全全实现党的领导，关键在于一支又红又专的科学队伍的成长。党的领导要努力组织这一支队伍。今天，这支队伍正在起变化，正在破资产阶级思想、立社会主义思想，正在制定各人的红专规划。科学工作者，无论青老年应决心改造自己，转变阶级立场；重视理论学习，掌握唯物主义辩证法。这样以人民事业为动力的科学工作者，必然会钻得更快，专得更深。应该着重提出的是关于加速培养青年的问题。青年是社会主义事业的接班人，导师的红透专深直接影响这支青年战士成长的快慢。所以，作导师的，不仅要加速改造自己，还要考虑在新形势下如何加速青年的成长。党的领导和行政领导人，在政治上既要红得更透，还要耐心细致地、诚恳地帮助科学工作者们进行思想改造，在业务上则要在科学家的帮助下，以战斗精神向科学进军，尽快学好本领。经历虽不同，但终必异途同归。这样一支人民的科学队伍，紧密地团结在党的周围，在向自然斗争中将是无往不利，无坚不摧，将使科学面貌迅速改观，为社会主义建设贡献出巨大力量。
