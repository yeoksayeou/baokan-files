    Invention and Creation are for Promotion and Application
    Commentator of this newspaper

    The biggest problem currently emerging in the nationwide leap forward in industrial and agricultural production is the shortage of labor. This problem is particularly prominent in rural areas. The wheat harvest was unprecedentedly abundant, and the harvesting work was also unprecedentedly heavy. Moreover, the summer harvest is crowded together with summer planting and the field management, weeding, and pest control of many autumn crops. In order to strive for a bumper autumn harvest, the movement to accumulate fertilizer, make fertilizer, and build water conservancy projects and fight drought has become a crash task in some areas. In the autumn, agricultural activities are equally tense and busy. What about winter? Many areas have already made plans for large-scale water conservancy construction, deep plowing of land, and large-scale fertilizer accumulation, so it is certainly impossible to relax.

    Because of the shortage of labor, some areas have been neglecting one thing for another, delaying important farm work. No one is watering where watering is needed, and no one is weeding where weeding is needed. Or fertilizer accumulation has been missed, resulting in weak seedlings. Many areas are using the night as day due to lack of labor, which is unavoidable at a certain stage, but certainly cannot last. Some places have collectivized cooking, sewing, childcare, and milling, liberating a lot of female labor, which is good, but it still cannot completely solve the problem of labor shortage.

    Is it possible to slow down the speed of progress? Slowing down the speed will prolong another more terrible tension—the painful tension caused by poverty and backwardness.

    Is there a way to overcome the difficulty of labor shortage and make our country's agriculture continue to leap forward? There is a way. The most important thing is to carry out the agricultural tool reform movement more widely and deeply. As long as we can replace all the old-fashioned farm tools with very low efficiency with improved farm tools and new-style farm tools in the shortest possible time, we can greatly overcome the current difficulty of labor shortage and develop the construction speed of our country's socialist agriculture faster.

    With the great leap forward in agriculture, new-style farm tools have been invented and created in large quantities in various places. The reason why our country has been able to build a large number of water conservancy projects and do a lot of basic construction in a short period of time, and the reason why this year's summer harvest crops have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, is on the one hand the result of farmers' intensive labor, and on the other hand it is inseparable from the tool reform. During the upsurge of water conservancy construction, farmers in many areas could only build one cubic meter of earthwork a day at the beginning, but later, due to tool reform, it increased to several or even more than ten cubic meters a day, which is the best illustration.

    However, there is a big shortcoming in some places in the tool reform, that is, they only care about creating and not promoting, and do not care whether farmers are actually using them. Before the wheat harvest, various harvesting machines and many other summer harvesting tools were invented and created in various places, and many places manufactured many vehicles, but during the wheat harvest, they were still harvested with sickles and carried with shoulder poles. Many newly created tools and machines for cultivating, weeding, sowing, and transplanting rice seedlings are rarely quickly promoted and applied to a wide range of areas. This spring, thanks to the efforts of comrades in Zhejiang Province, the reputation of the double-wheeled double-shared plow was first restored nationwide. All provinces have formulated plans to promote the double-wheeled double-shared plow. However, in many places, old plows were still used for plowing during the summer cultivation. Until before the summer cultivation, the national plan to promote the double-wheeled double-shared plow was only 24.3% completed. The reason for this phenomenon is that various places have not grasped the leadership tightly.

    "Our revolution is for the most rapid development of social productive forces." (Liu Shaoqi) The agricultural tool reform movement is a very important measure to improve my country's agricultural productivity. However, the level of productivity of a country or a society is not measured by whether it has the most advanced tools, but mainly by the tools that are universally and massively used. The emergence of a new tool only presents the possibility of increasing social productivity. Turning possibility into reality is still after this new tool is widely promoted and massively used. The industrial revolution in Europe in the eighteenth century was caused by the invention of the steam engine. But it was only after the steam engine was universally used in factories and enterprises that the industrial revolution was finally completed, and social productive forces "more magnificent and numerous than all preceding generations combined" appeared (The Communist Manifesto). The mass tool reform movement in our country has produced a large number of new-style tools and machines with very high efficiency. If these new things have not been universally applied to production, the social productivity of our country cannot be improved faster. Some comrades limit the significance and purpose of the agricultural tool reform movement to invention and creation itself. This idea is wrong. Creating and inventing more efficient advanced tools is very important only because it is useful, only because it can rapidly increase the social productivity of our country after it is universally promoted and used. Comrade Mao Zedong once said in the article "Rectify the Party's Style of Work": "Some comrades just hold the arrow (referring to Marxism) in their hands and rub it repeatedly, praising it loudly: 'Good arrow! Good arrow!' but they are always unwilling to let it go. Such people are antique connoisseurs and have almost nothing to do with the revolution." This is the case with revolutionary theory, with Marxism, and with other things, and with the agricultural tool reform movement. If the new tools invented and created by the masses are not sent to the fields and universally used in production, but are displayed in agricultural tool exhibitions for people to visit, what use is it to production besides illustrating that our people have such clever people who have created such a good new tool? What role does it play in improving social productivity?

    Marxist dialectics tells us that improvement and popularization are the unity of opposites and interact with each other. A work, a movement, has three states: advanced, intermediate, and backward. When advanced experience is popularized, the intermediate and backward parts are raised to the advanced level, the work progresses, and the movement is carried out. "Breakthrough at one point, promote the whole"; "Cultivate typical examples, create experience, and promote the overall situation"; visiting and comparing; planting experimental fields; holding exhibitions, etc. These working methods and leadership methods are all for improvement, and they are also for popularization. Correctly solving the relationship between improvement and popularization can make the work develop smoothly. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our improvement is an improvement on the basis of popularization; our popularization is a popularization under the guidance of improvement." ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art") The significance of promoting improved farm tools is not only that it can improve current productivity and better complete the various indicators of the Great Leap Forward; its significance also lies in opening up roads and laying the foundation for new improvements, for new inventions and creations, so that the agricultural tool reform movement can develop healthily to a higher stage. And every development of this movement will push our country's social productivity to a higher level. This is exactly the case. The Lichao No. 1 Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, based on the original peanut rubbing tool, made a peanut shelling machine, which increased efficiency by six and a half times compared to the original old tool; after this shelling machine was promoted (popularized) to the Hesheng No. 4 Cooperative in Zhangjia Township, their cooperative added a windmill to the machine (improvement), and the efficiency increased to eight times; later, the Hesheng No. 4 Cooperative's wind-powered peanut shelling machine was passed back (re-popularized) to the Lichao No. 1 Cooperative, and the cooperative added a sieve to the machine (re-improvement) on the basis of the improvement of the Hesheng No. 4 Cooperative, and the efficiency was increased to nine and a half times, and the entire shelling process was operated mechanically. Our agricultural tool reform movement is developing in this way: improvement, popularization, re-improvement, re-popularization, moving forward in this way, and will eventually lead my country's agricultural production to modernization and mechanization. Ignoring the promotion and popularization of improved tools also weakens the foundation for continued creation and improvement, and hinders and hinders the development of the entire agricultural tool reform movement.

    In many places, creation and promotion are disconnected, only creation but no promotion. On the one hand, it is due to the wrong and one-sided understanding of the significance and purpose of the agricultural tool reform movement, and on the other hand, it is also due to the lack of strict organizational work. Attention is paid to the support and encouragement of the inventions and creations of advanced elements, while the political and ideological education of the broad masses is ignored, so that although new tools are created, some masses are still unwilling to discard the old farm tools that they have been using "very smoothly." Many new farm tools have been invented and created, but because the processing and manufacturing forces have not been organized, or the forces have been organized, but the raw materials have not been prepared, the new tools have to be placed alone in the office or exhibition hall and cannot be manufactured and promoted in large quantities. Or, the processing and manufacturing forces have also been organized, the raw materials have also been prepared, and the conservative thoughts of the masses have also been overcome, and a large number of new tools have been manufactured and promoted, but because some other necessary conditions have not been prepared, they still cannot be used. There are many places where "vehicle-ization" has this situation, but the roads have not been repaired in coordination with "vehicle-ization," so the vehicles have to be left at home and cannot be used. Everything is interconnected and mutually restricted. If we do not understand this law, the phenomenon of "single fight" and neglecting one thing for another will inevitably occur in our work. To improve working methods and achieve strong political leadership and thorough organizational work, we must pay attention to and grasp the laws of the interconnection and mutual restriction of things. This is reflected in the leadership of the agricultural tool reform movement, that is, combining creation and promotion, combining promotion and use, combining improvement and popularization, and combining strong political leadership and thorough organizational work. Ignoring any aspect will affect the healthy development of the agricultural tool reform movement, will affect and hinder the rapid improvement of agricultural labor productivity in our country, and will affect and hinder the speed of the Great Leap Forward in our country's agriculture from accelerating further.

    Sometimes, there are not many objective difficulties, but it is only due to a kind of inertia that the promotion work is dragged down. In order to overcome this inertia, the leadership in various places should establish a system of limited-time promotion, regular inspection, and reporting, commend those with good promotion results, and criticize those with poor promotion results. The experience of Fuyang area in Anhui Province has proved that only in this way can improved farm tools be quickly promoted and applied to the production activities of the broad masses.

    创造发明是为了推广应用
    本报评论员
    在全国工农业生产大跃进中，目前出现的最大问题，是劳动力不足。在农村方面，这问题尤其突出。小麦空前地丰收了，收割工作也空前地繁重。而夏收又同夏种及许多大秋作物的田间管理、除草治虫等任务挤在一起。为了争取秋季大丰收，积肥、制肥和兴修水利、抗旱等运动又成为若干地区的突击任务。到了秋季，农事活动也是一样紧张繁忙。冬季呢？许多地区现在已经作了大修水利、深翻土地和大量积肥的计划，当然也不可能轻松。
    因为劳动力不足，有的地区顾此失彼，耽误了重要的农活。该浇水的没人去浇，该锄草的没人去锄。或者是误了积肥，产生了弱苗。许多地区因为劳力不足，把黑夜当白天用，这在一定阶段是不可免的，但肯定不能持久。有的地方把做饭、缝衣、看孩子、磨面等工作集体化了，解放出许多妇女劳力，这是好的，但也还不能完全解决劳动力不足的问题。
    是不是可以减缓一些前进的速度呢？减缓速度就会延长另一种更可怕的紧张——因贫穷和落后而造成的痛苦的紧张。
    有没有办法克服劳动力不足的困难，使我国农业不断地跃进再跃进呢？有办法的。最重要的就是更广泛更深入地开展农具改革运动。只要我们能够在最短期间内把一切效率很低的旧式农具统统换成改良农具和新式农具，我们就能够在很大程度上克服目前劳力不足的困难，把我国的社会主义农业的建设速度发展得更快些。
    随着农业的大跃进，各地创造发明了大批的新式农具。我们国家所以能够在短期内兴修大量水利工程，做好许多基本建设；今年夏收作物所以能够获得空前的丰收，一方面是农民紧张劳动的结果，另一方面也是同工具改革分不开的。在水利建设高潮中，许多地区农民一开始只能一天做一个土方，以后由于工具改革，提高到一天好几方甚至十几方，就是最好的说明。
    然而，有些地方在工具改革中却存在着一个很大的缺点，就是只管创造，不管推广，不管农民是否实际上在使用。麦收前各地发明创造了各种各样的收割机和很多很多别的夏收工具，不少地方制造了很多很多的车子，但在麦收的时候却仍然是用镰刀收割，用扁担挑运。许多新创造的中耕除草和播种、插秧的工具和机械，也很少迅速地推广应用到广大地区。今年春天，由于浙江省同志们的努力，首先在全国恢复了双轮双铧犁的名誉。各省都纷纷制定了推广双轮双铧犁的计划。但是，夏耕中很多地方仍用旧犁耕地。一直到夏耕以前，全国推广双轮双铧犁的计划只完成了24.3％。造成这种现象的原因，是各地没有抓紧领导。
    “我们的革命就是为了最迅速地发展社会生产力。”（刘少奇）农具改革运动就是提高我国农业生产力的一个很重要的措施。但是，衡量一个国家、一个社会的生产力水平，并不在于它有没有最先进的工具，主要的还是决定于普遍的大量使用着的工具。一个新工具的出现，只是出现了提高社会生产力的可能性。把可能性变成现实，还是在这一新工具被普遍推广大量使用以后。欧洲十八世纪的产业革命，是由蒸汽机的发明引起的。但只是在蒸汽机普遍使用于工厂企业以后，产业革命才最后完成，才出现了“比先前一切世代总共造成的生产力还要宏伟众多”的社会生产力（共产党宣言）。我国群众性的工具改革运动产生了大量的效率很高的新式工具和机械，这些新东西如果还没有普遍运用到生产中去，我们国家的社会生产力就不可能更快地提高。有些同志把农具改革运动的意义和目的局限于发明创造本身，这种想法是不对的。创造发明效率更高的先进工具所以很重要，只是由于它有用，只是由于它在被普遍推广和使用后能迅速地提高我国的社会生产力。毛泽东同志在“整顿党的作风”一文中曾说：“有些同志则仅仅把箭（指马克思主义）拿在手里搓来搓去，连声赞曰：‘好箭！好箭！’却老是不愿意放出去。这样的人就是古董鉴赏家，几乎和革命不发生关系。”对待革命理论，对待马克思主义如此，对待其他事物，对待农具改革运动也是如此。如果不把群众发明创造的新工具送到田里，在生产中普遍使用起来，而是把它摆在农具展览会上供人参观，除了说明我们的人民群众中有这样聪明的人，他曾创造了这样一个很好的新工具以外，对生产有什么用处呢？对提高社会生产力有什么作用呢？
    马克思主义辩证法告诉我们，提高和普及是对立的统一，是交互地作用着的。一件工作，一个运动，都有先进、中间和落后的三种状况。先进的经验普及了，中间和落后部分提高到先进水平了，工作就有了进步，运动就有了开展。“突破一点，推动全面”；“培养典型，创造经验，推动全盘”；参观评比；种试验田；办展览会等等工作方法和领导方法，都是为了提高，也都是为了普及。正确地解决了提高和普及的关系，就能使工作顺利地向前发展。毛泽东同志说：“我们的提高，是在普及基础上的提高；我们的普及，是在提高指导下的普及。”（“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”）推广改良了的新农具的意义，绝不仅仅是能够提高当前的生产力，能够更好地完成大跃进的各项指标；它的意义还在于给新的提高、给新的发明创造开辟道路，打下基础，使农具改革运动向更高的阶段健康发展。而这一运动的每一发展，都将把我国的社会生产力推向更高的水平。事实正是这样的。陕西省大荔县荔潮一社在原来的花生搓皮工具基础上，制成了花生脱皮机，比原来的旧工具提高效率六倍半；这件脱皮机推广（普及）到张家乡合升四社后，他们社又在机具上添了一个风车（提高），效率增加到八倍；后来，合升四社的风力花生脱皮机又传回（再普及）荔潮一社，该社又在合升四社改进的基础上增设了一个筛子（再提高），效率又提高到九倍半，而且整个的脱皮工序都用机械操作了。我们的农具改革运动就是这样向前发展的：提高，普及，再提高，再普及，这样往复前进，终将把我国农业生产引向现代化机械化。忽视了改良工具的推广和普及，也就削弱了继续创造和提高的基础，也就阻碍和妨害了整个农具改革运动的发展。
    很多地方创造和推广脱节，只创造不推广，一方面是由于对农具改革运动的意义和目的认识错误和片面，另一方面也是由于缺乏严密的组织工作。注意了对先进分子创造发明的支持和鼓励，而忽略了对广大群众的政治思想教育，以致新工具虽然创造出来，有些群众却仍不愿意丢开那已经使用得“很顺手”的旧农具。许多新的农具发明创造出来了，由于没有组织好加工和制造力量，或力量虽已组织好，原材料又没有准备好，结果新工具只好孤零零的放在办公室或展览会上，不能大量制造大量推广。或者是，加工制造的力量也组织好了，原材料也准备下了，群众的保守思想也克服了，大量的新工具已经制造出来并且推广了，只是因为其他一些必要的条件没有准备好，还是不能使用。有不少地方的“车子化”就有这种情况，只是没有配合着“车子化”把道路修好，车子就只好仍放在家里，不能使用起来。任何事物都是相互联系相互制约的，不懂得这个规律，工作中必然发生“单打一”的顾此失彼的现象。要改进工作方法，要实现坚强的政治领导和周密的组织工作，就要注意和掌握事物的相互联系、相互制约的规律。这表现在对农具改革运动的领导上，就是创造和推广相结合，推广和使用相结合，提高和普及相结合，坚强的政治领导和周密的组织工作相结合。忽略了任何一面，都会影响农具改革运动的健康发展，都会影响和阻碍我国农业劳动生产率迅速提高，都会影响和阻碍我国农业大跃进的速度更加加快。
    有时候，客观上困难并不多，而仅仅是由于一种惰性，就使得推广工作拖了下来。为了克服这种惰性，各地领导上应当建立一个限期推广、定期检查和汇报的制度，表扬推广成绩好的，批评推广成绩不好的。安徽省阜阳地区的经验已经证明，只有这样，才能迅速地把改良农具推广应用到广大群众的生产活动中去。
