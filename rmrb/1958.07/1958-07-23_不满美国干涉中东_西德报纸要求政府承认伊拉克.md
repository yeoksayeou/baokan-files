Xinhua News Agency, Bonn: Recently, many bourgeois newspapers in West Germany have advocated recognizing the revolutionary Iraqi government and have expressed dissatisfaction with the US-British armed intervention in the Middle East.

The "Cologne City News" said that it would be wrong not to recognize the new government in Baghdad simply because it came about through a revolution. The newspaper condemned the US-British armed intervention as "a strategic colonialism of the Western countries against the Arabs who are striving for neutralism and freedom."

Essen's "West German Report," proceeding from the interests of West German monopoly capital, advocated that West Germany pursue a "more realistic" Middle East policy. The newspaper believes that these interests require West Germany to be connected with the West while also building relations with the Arab world. Therefore, while "strengthening" the Western bloc, West Germany must also find ways to maintain the original relations between Arab countries and West Germany.

    不满美国干涉中东
    西德报纸要求政府承认伊拉克
    新华社讯  波恩消息：近来西德有不少资产阶级报纸主张承认伊拉克革命政权，并且对美英对中东的武装干涉表示不满。
    “科隆城新闻报”说，如果只是因为巴格达新政府产生于革命就不承认它，那是错误的。这家报纸谴责美英的武装干涉是“西方国家对争取中立主义自由的阿拉伯人的一种战略殖民主义”。
    埃森的“西德汇报”从西德垄断资本的利益出发，主张西德实行一种“比较现实”的中东政策。这家报纸认为，上述利益要求西德既要同西方有联系，又要同阿拉伯世界拉关系。因此，西德在“加强”西方集团的同时，也必须设法保持阿拉伯各国和西德原有的关系。
