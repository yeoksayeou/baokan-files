To protest against the American and British imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and to support the Republic of Iraq, the capital's literary and artistic groups have rushed to compile programs for street propaganda.

The Beijing People's Art Theatre and the China Youth Art Theatre, with a fighting attitude, each compiled and performed two tableau plays. When they performed in places such as Tiananmen Square and in front of the department store, they greatly excited the audience present. In order to allow more people to see these tableau plays with political education significance, it is hoped that the theatres can add such a tableau play before the official performance of the drama in the theatre, just like the newsreel before the official film screening. This will further expand the influence of these tableau plays and educate more people.

    反美英侵略的活报剧
    首都的文艺团体，为了抗议美、英帝国主义侵入黎巴嫩、约旦和支持伊拉克共和国，都赶编了节目到街头进行宣传。
    北京人民艺术剧院和中国青年艺术剧院，以战斗的姿态各编演了两出活报剧。他们分别在天安门、百货大楼前等处演出时，大大地激动了在场的观众。为使更多的人看到这些富有政治教育意义的活报剧，希望剧院能在剧场演出的正式剧目前，加演一个这样的活报剧；就像放映正式的影片前的新闻短片。这样，将更扩大这些活报剧的影响，使更多的人受到教育。
