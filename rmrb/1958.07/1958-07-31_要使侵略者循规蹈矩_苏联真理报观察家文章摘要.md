Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 30th. "Pravda" today published an article by an observer, criticizing the deceptive tactics employed by the US and British governments regarding the issue of a summit conference. The commentary pointed out that the United States and Britain have consistently avoided holding a summit conference, either independently or within the framework of the Security Council. They are attempting to deceive world public opinion with deceptive tricks on this issue in order to evade responsibility for their aggression against countries in the Near and Middle East.

The article said that the heads of the US and British governments were forced to reveal their true colors as aggressors in their recent replies to Khrushchev. In this instance, the US President actually rejected his recent proposal. He did not mention holding a summit conference in the Security Council, but instead suggested holding an ordinary Security Council meeting with general procedures, i.e., with "voting machines" obediently printing according to the instructions of the US State Department. He strikes a pose of willingness to talk, while in reality leading the matter into a dead end, into a labyrinth of endless discussions on procedural and formal issues. Under the cover of such discussions, the aggressors will continue their plundering activities in the Near and Middle East.

The article wrote that the US President's proposal is a mockery of reason. Only those who dare not face world public opinion, who dare not be held responsible for their plundering activities in the Near and Middle East, and their adventurous policies that put all mankind on the brink of war, would make such a proposal.

Prime Minister Macmillan, in his reply on July 26, also discarded his pretense of advocating negotiations and unconditionally supported the US position. Macmillan's approach shows that there is clearly a common conspiracy between the US and British imperialists, which is to expand aggression.

The commentary said that world public opinion now sees that the ruling circles of the United States and Britain are deliberately deceiving public opinion in order to evade responsibility for aggression. They played roles that were pre-assigned long ago. In the first act, Macmillan won applause from Labor MPs in the British House of Commons. However, the performance ended there. The actor playing the "peacemaker" failed miserably, and finally exposed the repulsive true colors of colonialists and aggressors.

The article pointed out that the Soviet people resolutely demand that the reckless aggressors be made to behave themselves. Peace-loving people all over the world condemn the lies and tricks of the US and British interventionists and demand a swift end to the aggression and the withdrawal of US and British aggression troops from the Near and Middle East.

    要使侵略者循规蹈矩
    苏联真理报观察家文章摘要
    新华社莫斯科30日电　“真理报”今天发表观察家的一篇文章，抨击美、英政府在举行政府首脑会议问题上所玩弄的骗人手法。评论指出，美国和英国一直既不想单独地也不想在安理会范围内举行政府首脑会议。他们企图在这个问题上用骗人的伎俩欺骗世界舆论，以逃避侵略中近东国家的罪责。
    文章说，美英政府首脑在最近给赫鲁晓夫的回信中被迫暴露了自己侵略者的真面目。在这一次，美国总统实际上拒绝了他最近的建议。他不提在安全理事会举行政府首脑会议，却建议召开带有一般程序、即带有按照美国国务院的指令顺从地打印的“表决机器”的安理会普通会议。他摆出愿意会谈的姿态，而实际上却把事情引入绝境，引入就程序和形式问题讨论不休的迷宫。在这种讨论的掩饰下，侵略者将继续其在中近东的掠夺勾当。
    文章写道，美国总统的建议，是对理智的嘲弄。只有不敢面对世界舆论，不敢对他们掠夺中近东的勾当、不敢对他们使全人类处于战争边缘的冒险政策负责的人才会提出这种建议。
    麦克米伦首相在7月26日的复信中也抛掉了他主张谈判的假面具，而无条件地支持美国的立场。麦克米伦的做法表明，美英帝国主义者之间显然有一个共同的阴谋，这就是扩大侵略。
    评论说，现在世界舆论界都看到，美国和英国的统治集团有意地欺骗舆论，以逃避侵略的责任。他们扮演了预先早已分配好的角色。在第一幕中，麦克米伦在英国下院赢得了工党议员的掌声。但是，表演到此结束。扮演“和事佬”的演员可耻地失败了，终于暴露了殖民主义者和侵略者的令人憎恶的真面目。
    文章指出，苏联人民坚决要求使轻举妄动的侵略者循规蹈矩。全世界爱好和平的人们斥责美英干涉者的谎言和诡计，要求迅速制止侵略，并且从中近东撤出美英侵略军队。
