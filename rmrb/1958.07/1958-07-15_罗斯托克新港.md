    Rostock New Port

    The German Democratic Republic's ten-thousand-ton ships, fully loaded with goods, sail from two berths toward the Baltic Sea. Simultaneously, a dozen or twenty huge cargo ships sequentially enter the port from the Baltic Sea; modern conveyor belts send the goods from the ships to the warehouses on the shore. Cranes and various cargo handling machines on the shore operate ceaselessly, and people work intensely... This is the vision of the future Rostock New Port.

    Expanding the Rostock seaport into a modern major commercial port is one of the important tasks of the German Democratic Republic's Second Five-Year Plan. With the development of industry, the GDR's foreign trade is expanding daily. Currently, it trades with more than fifty countries. However, due to the lack of a modern major commercial port, it spends about 80 million rubles in foreign exchange each year just on renting foreign ships and transshipping goods in foreign ports. The completion of the new port will solve this problem.

    The construction plan of the Rostock New Port is as follows: Two berths, each 180 meters wide and 1 kilometer long, will be built next to Lake Petlin near the old Rostock port. Then, a canal will be dug to connect these two berths to the Baltic Sea. By 1960, one of these two berths will be completed, and the new port will be fully completed by 1967. The old port currently handles one million tons of cargo annually. By 1967, the new port's cargo handling capacity will reach six million tons annually and could be expanded to twenty million tons in the future. To adapt to the transport work of the new port, a railway station will be specially built. Before 1960, the railway from Rostock to Berlin will be converted into a double track.

    Construction of the new port has already begun. The people of the German Democratic Republic attach great importance to this huge project. Many people have donated funds to the new port, and many experts have come from afar to participate in the construction. The residents of Rostock are even more enthusiastic, and they have pledged to participate in the construction of the new port in their spare time.

### 罗斯托克新港

    罗斯托克新港
    德意志民主共和国的万吨轮船，满载着货物从两个停泊处驶向波罗的海，同时，一二十只巨大的货船也从波罗的海顺序驶入港口；现代化的输送带把船上的货物分别送到岸上的仓库里去；岸上的起重机和各种运货机器不停地转动着，人们紧张地工作着……，这就是未来的罗斯托克新港的景象。
    把罗斯托克海港扩建成一个现代化的大商港，是德意志民主共和国第二个五年计划的重要任务之一。随着工业的发展，民主德国的对外贸易日益扩大，目前它同五十多个国家进行贸易。但是由于没有现代化的大商港，每年仅在租用别国船只和在别国港口转运货物方面，就得花费约八千万卢布的外汇。新港建成后这个问题便能得到解决。
    罗斯托克新港的工程是这样的：在罗斯托克旧港附近的贝特林湖旁边修建两个宽达一百八十公尺、长达一公里的停泊处，然后开凿一条运河把这两个停泊处同波罗的海联在一起。到1960年，这两个停泊处中的一个就可以建成了，1967年新港将全部建成。旧港现在每年的货物运输量是一百万吨，1967年新港的货物运输量每年将达六百万吨，而将来可扩大到二千万吨。为了适应新港的运输工作，要专门建筑一个火车站，在1960年以前，由罗斯托克至柏林的铁路，将改建成双轨。
    新港的建设已经开始了。民主德国全国人民都非常重视这项巨大的工程，很多人为新港捐了款，很多专家从远地来参加建设。罗斯托克市的居民们热情更高，他们纷纷保证利用业余时间参加新港的建设。
