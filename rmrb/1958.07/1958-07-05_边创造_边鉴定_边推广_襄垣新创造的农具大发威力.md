Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd – Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province, recently, through meticulous and thorough ideological education, fully mobilized and relied on the masses to correct the shortcomings in farm tool reform, which focused only on experimenting and creating new products while neglecting large-scale promotion and use. This has allowed hundreds of newly invented farm tools to unleash their power, and the county's technical revolution is gradually reaching a climax.

When Xiangyuan County began its farm tool reform, it progressed rapidly, with new inventions almost every day and new experiments happening all the time. However, after two months, of the more than two hundred new farm tools that had been invented, only about a thousand had been promoted.

The Xiangyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly analyzed the situation and realized that moving from invention and creation to promotion and use was still a work process, and that empty slogans without concrete work would not suffice. Therefore, they changed their past practices and invited more than thirty agricultural cooperative cadres, farmer-technicians, and sixteen technical workers to engage in sincere conversations, conducting a comprehensive appraisal of the two hundred-plus new farm tools that had already been created. At the meeting, people voluntarily examined their erroneous thoughts of doubt, apprehension, and waiting regarding the new farm tools, and they dared to express different opinions and engage in debates. After the meeting's full discussion, everyone decided to vigorously promote more than one hundred and twenty kinds of farm tools that were labor-saving, cost-effective, and highly efficient.

Based on the farmers' emphasis on practicality, Xiangyuan County also adopted concrete accounting methods in the promotion of new farm tools, repeatedly explaining the benefits of the new farm tools, arousing people's ideological attention, and combining this with organizing practical operations to break down ideological doubts and impart usage techniques. After the above-mentioned in-depth and arduous work, the county's farm tool reform changed the past situation of only creating but not promoting, and a new atmosphere of creating, appraising, and promoting simultaneously emerged in various places. The quality of newly invented farm tools has also improved, so that every item is applicable and everything is satisfying.

    边创造　边鉴定　边推广
    襄垣新创造的农具大发威力
    据新华社太原3日电　山西省襄垣县最近通过细致深入的思想教育，充分发动和依靠群众，纠正农具改革中只顾试验创造新产品，忽视大量推广使用的缺点，使几百种新创造的农具大发威力，全县技术革命逐渐走向高潮。
    襄垣县在开始进行农具改革时，进展很快，几乎天天有新创造，时时有新试验，但是两个月以后，当时创造发明的二百多种新农具，推广了不过一千件。
    中共襄垣县委会对上述情况及时作了分析，体会到从发明创造到推广使用还是一个工作过程，光空口号召，不作具体工作是不行的。这样，改变过去作法，邀集了三十多个农业社干部、农民技术人材和十六个技术工人，进行恳切交谈，对当时已经创造出来的二百种新农具进行全面鉴定。会上，人们自动检查了对待新农具的怀疑、顾虑和等待的错误思想，并且敢于说出不同意见，展开争论。经过会议充分研究，大家决定大力推广一百二十多种省工省钱效率高的农具。
    根据农民讲究实际的特点，襄垣县在推广新农具中，还采取具体算账办法，反复说明新农具的好处，引起人们思想重视，并且结合组织实际操作，打破思想疑虑，传授使用技术。经过上述深入艰巨的工作，全县农具改革一改过去只创造不推广的局面，各地陆续出现边创造、边鉴定、边推广使用的新气象，新创造的农具质量也有改进，达到件件都适用，样样称人心。
