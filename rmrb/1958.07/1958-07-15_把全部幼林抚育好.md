    Cultivate All Young Forests Well
    Mu Zhong
    During the upsurge of afforestation in the first half of this year, the country completed afforestation on over 319 million mu of barren mountains and planted over 13.6 billion trees around houses and villages. The achievements are enormous. The key to consolidating these results and ensuring that newly planted saplings survive more, grow faster, and grow well lies in whether timely tending and protection work such as weeding, loosening soil, and earthing up is carried out for the young forests. At present, many regions have already launched a young forest tending movement. However, according to incomplete statistics, the area of young forests that has been tended nationwide only accounts for 15.6% of the afforestation area, and many regions have not yet attached importance to young forest tending work.
    Guizhou Province has taken the lead in young forest tending. Immediately after the spring afforestation, they launched a massive tending movement. By the end of June, the area of young forests that had been tended reached one-third of the spring afforestation area. In a province with a relatively small population, being able to tend young forests on a large scale while the summer harvest and drought resistance are proceeding intensively proves that other regions can certainly do the same.
    Young forest tending is a form of production. It is as important as agricultural intertillage, weeding, and drought resistance. Without young forest tending, the afforestation this spring may be in vain. Provinces, counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives all need to make specific arrangements for young forest tending work and conduct timely inspections and evaluations, organically integrating it with other production. Cooperatives with specialized forestry production organizations should not relax leadership and inspection just because there are dedicated personnel managing it.
    Young forest tending must be done in the right season. Generally, it is better to be early than late, as delays will be futile. Currently, it is the period when young trees are growing vigorously and weeds are rampant, so it is necessary to seize the time and carry it out promptly.
    Tending young forests requires careful weeding and loosening of the soil. For young trees with shallow soil coverage, exposed roots, or those that are leaning, earthing up and supporting should be done well; in areas with better water conditions, watering and irrigation should be carried out. In addition to tending the young forests well, constant attention should be paid to protection, proper management of grazing, timely prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and vigorous prevention of fires to avoid damage to the young forests.
    Let us go all out, tend all the newly planted young forests this year well, protect them well, and ensure that all these tree seedlings survive and quickly become forests!

    把全部幼林抚育好
    穆中
    今年上半年的造林高潮中全国完成荒山造林三亿一千九百多万亩，四旁植树一百三十六亿多株，成绩是巨大的。要巩固这些劳动成果，使新栽的幼树活得多、长得快、长得好，关键在于能否及时地进行除草、松土、培土等幼林抚育保护工作。目前，不少地区已经开展了幼林抚育运动。但据不完全统计，全国已抚育的幼林面积只占造林面积的15.6％，许多地区对幼林抚育工作还没有引起重视。
    贵州省在幼林抚育方面已经领先了一步。他们紧接着春季造林以后，就掀起了一个声势浩大的抚育运动。到6月底已抚育的幼林面积达春季造林面积的三分之一。在这样一个人口比较少的省，在夏收、抗旱紧张进行的情况下，能够大规模地抚育幼林，当然其他地区也一定能够这样做。
    幼林抚育就是一项生产，它和农业上的中耕、薅田、抗旱是同样的重要，不进行幼林抚育，今春造林就有可能前功尽弃。省、县、区、乡、社都有必要将幼林抚育工作进行具体安排，并且要按时检查、评比，和其他生产有机地结合起来。有了林业生产专业组织的合作社，也不能认为有了专人管理就放松了领导和检查。
    幼林抚育一定要掌握季节。一般是宁早勿迟，迟了就会徒劳无功。目前正是幼树生长旺盛，也是杂草猖獗的时期，因此要抓紧时间，及时进行。
    抚育幼林要细致地进行除草、松土。对于复土过浅、露根或倒伏的幼树，要做好培土和扶持；在水源条件较好的地方，要进行浇水灌溉。对于幼林，不但要抚育好，还要经常注意保护，妥善管理放牧，适时防治病虫害和大力防止火灾，避免幼林遭受危害。
    让我们鼓足干劲，把今年新造的全部幼林都抚育好，保护好，保证这些树木的幼苗都成活，快成林！
