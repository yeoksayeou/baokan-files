Riding the East Wind, Braving the Waves
    ——A Record of the Beijing Workers' Garden Party for Advancing Towards Technology and Culture
    By Our Correspondent

    Yesterday evening, more than 30,000 workers in the capital held a grand garden party at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace to celebrate the Party's birthday and to demonstrate their commitment to advancing towards technology and culture.

    The Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, this ancient palace and courtyard, was full of life. The towering ancient cypress groves were filled with the workers' bold songs. As night fell, tens of thousands of colorful lights in the garden shone brightly, illuminating the excited faces of the workers, the thousands of new products they presented to the Party as birthday gifts, and the poems and paintings created by the workers themselves. In the eastern grove, various machines roared, and the masters of the machines were demonstrating their operation to the visitors. This was no ordinary garden party; it was a review of the significant achievements made by the capital's workers in their march towards technology and culture, a rally to pledge their advance towards newer goals! Listen, the majestic song rises:

    Workers have high aspirations, skillful hands and ingenious minds. Three inventions a day, five creations in three days. Everyone uses their hands and brains to launch a high tide of technological revolution...

    This was a chorus of 30,000 people, and the garden party began amidst this thunderous song. People flocked to the Beijing New Product Exhibition Hall, which opened here yesterday, to the poetry corridors and art galleries that were spread throughout the garden, and to the red flag boards plastered with the deeds of heroic figures. At this time, the literary and artistic programs written and performed by the workers themselves were also meeting the audience in fifteen different places. The sound of music and singing mixed with the applause of the people, resounding in all directions of the garden.

    The workers' artistic performances can truly be described as "a hundred flowers blooming," with more than 200 programs, including Peking opera, Ping opera, comic dialogues, clapper talks, Shandong Allegro... Many of the songs and stories they performed were based on real people and events from their own units, with vivid content, fully reflecting the workers' soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and heroic spirit.

    On the stage in the cultural garden, more than 30 railway workers were singing about the railway employees' achievements in manufacturing more than 1,500 tools to improve transportation capacity in a short period. The actors had just finished singing the story of Wang Yushu, a young railway maintenance worker, who broke down superstitions, liberated his mind, and created the world's first simple turnout. Suddenly, the audience spotted Wang Yushu in the crowd, and groups of workers surrounded him, asking him to talk about the creation process.

    Wang Yushu excitedly introduced his creation process, and thunderous applause erupted from the crowd. Then, a young worker stepped forward, shook his hand, and expressed his determination to learn from him.

    Under the huge slogan "Don't be superstitious, don't be inferior, go all out, and march towards technology and culture," coal miners wearing headlamps and work clothes were singing the "Miner's Medley," "...The General Line is a guiding light, inspiring us to move forward. The coal industry will surpass old England next year. Work hard, work diligently, work practically, work vigorously, add more effort, let the red flag of the General Line be all red throughout the mine, all red throughout the mine..." People applauded and cheered enthusiastically for the miners' soaring enthusiasm. Then, the workers from the Chengzi Mine performed a Northeast Errenzhuan: "Breaking Superstition," which praised the deeds of Zhen Zhiqiang, a coal miner and Communist Party member, in making a big fuss about the technological revolution. Technological innovation has formed a high tide among coal miners. Recently, the workers of Chengzi Mine and Mentougou alone have put forward more than 3,900 suggestions for technological innovation and rationalization. The workers of Chengzi Mine put forward more than 2,000 suggestions in seven days. The workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant sang their own compiled Iron and Steel Workers' Song on the stage. They sang: The iron and steel workers are full of enthusiasm, completing the ten-year expansion in four years, increasing steel output by half without increasing investment, and striving to advance the construction period even further, We will certainly surpass England and leave the United States behind.

    "Go see the red flag board!" "Go see the red flag board!" A stream of people constantly poured under the sixty wooden red flag boards to view the photos and deeds of the heroic figures on the red flag boards. The deeds of Shi Youheng, a young technician from the Civil Lighting Factory, were particularly noteworthy. This young man, in order to surpass the Miller-Paige electric lights of England, tried to make oil-containing bearings, and he was not discouraged or disheartened even after failing eight consecutive times. He finally succeeded on the ninth try. The people who watched praised Shi Youheng as "a good example."

    Last night, the Cultural Palace was like a world of poetry and painting. Under the colorful lights, poems and paintings created by the workers themselves could be seen everywhere. In the fifteen poetry corridors and art galleries, more than 4,000 poems and paintings were exhibited, showing the workers' intelligence and their bold emotions. Today, the working class is not only a laborer, but also the most outstanding painter and poet. The visitors stopped in front of a poem, and an old worker could not help but recite it aloud: The red flag flutters in the east wind, 600 million people have high aspirations, Poor and blank to make revolution, soaring enthusiasm into the clouds, like a giant dragon dancing in the universe, high mountains and rivers all give way, if you ask how fast the giant dragon dances, the journey of twenty years will arrive in one day. As soon as the old worker finished reading, a burst of warm applause erupted from the crowd: "Well written, great!" In the poetry and painting gallery of the Shijingshan Power Plant, a humorous poem caused bursts of laughter from the visitors. This poem has only four lines: The eastern giant dragon passes over the sky, the western cow stumbles on the ground, the dragon rider laughs heartily, the cow rider stares blankly.

    Writing poetry and painting has become an ordinary thing in the lives of Beijing workers today.

    Comrade Zhou Yang watched the workers' performances and poetry and painting creations last night, and he praised the workers' creative talents.

    The night was late, but the party was still going on. As we gradually moved away from the Cultural Palace, we could still hear the workers' intermittent singing:

    Along the Party's General Line
    Step out on the leaping footsteps
    Riding the rocket of ideals
    We race forward
    Cross the great river, cross the high mountains
    Leave the difficulties aside...

    乘东风破巨浪
    ——记北京工人向技术、文化进军游园大会
    本报记者
    昨天晚上，首都的三万多工人在劳动人民文化宫举行盛大的向技术和文化进军的游园大会，纪念党的生日。
    北京劳动人民文化宫，这个古老的宫殿和院落充满了生气。参天的古柏林里，到处飞扬着工人们豪迈的歌声。夜幕降临了，园内数万盏彩灯齐明，绚丽灿烂的灯光照着工人们兴奋的面孔，照着他们给党的生日献礼的成千上万的新产品，照着工人们自己创作的诗和画。在东树林里，各种机器发出轰隆轰隆的响声，机器的主人给参观者们进行着操作表演。这不是一般的游园会，这是首都工人向技术和文化进军所取得的重大成就的检阅，是他们向更新的目标前进的誓师！听，雄壮的歌声响起来了：
    工人志气高，心灵手又巧。一日三发明，三日五创造。人人动手又动脑，掀起技术革命的高潮……
    这是三万人的大合唱，在这震天的歌声中游园晚会开始了。人们拥向了昨天在这开幕的北京新产品展览馆，拥向了遍布全园的诗廊和画廊，拥向贴满英雄人物事迹的红旗榜前，这时工人们自编自演的文艺节目，也分别在十五个地方和观众见面了，乐声、歌声交和着人们的鼓掌声响彻园内的四面八方。
    工人们的文艺演出真可称之为“百花盛开”，演出的二百多个节目中，有京剧、评剧、相声、快板、山东快书……。他们演的唱的很多都是本单位的真人真事，内容生动，充分反映了工人们冲天的革命干劲和英雄气概。
    在文化园的舞台上，三十多个铁路工人正在演唱铁路职工在短时期内制造出一千五百多件提高运输能力的工具的事迹。演员们刚刚唱完青年养路工人王玉书破除迷信、解放思想创制出世界第一台简易道岔的故事。突然，观众们在人群里发现了王玉书，成群的工人围着他，要他谈创制过程。
    王玉书兴奋地介绍了他的创制经过，人群中爆发出震耳的掌声，接着一个年青的工人走出来握着他的手，表示坚决向他学习。
    在“不迷信不自卑鼓足干劲向技术文化进军”的巨幅标语下，头戴头灯身着工作服的煤矿工人，正在演唱“矿工大联唱”，“……总路线是个指路灯，鼓舞着我们向前进，煤炭工业明年就赶过老牌英，苦干、穷干、实干、大干、加油干，总路线红旗全矿红全矿红……”人们为矿工们的冲天干劲热烈地鼓掌欢呼。接着城子矿工人们演出了东北二人转：“破除迷信”，它歌颂了采煤工人、共产党员甄志强大闹技术革命的事迹。技术革新在煤矿工人中已形成高潮，仅城子矿、门头沟的工人们最近已提出技术革新合理化建议三千九百多件，城子矿工人在七天时间提出了两千多件。石景山钢铁厂的工人们在舞台上演唱了自己编排的钢铁工人之歌。他们唱道：钢铁工人干劲冲天，十年扩建四年完，投资不增钢加番半，工期还要争取再提前，一定超过英国，把美国丢在后边。
    “看红旗榜去！”“看红旗榜去！”人流不断地拥向六十面木制的红旗榜下，观看红旗榜上面英雄人物的照片和事迹，民用灯具厂的青年技术员时友恒的事迹特别引人注意，这个小伙子，为了赶过英国米勒派摩电灯，试制含油轴承，连续失败八次也不气馁不灰心，第九次终于试制成功了。观看的人们都称赞时友恒是“好样的”。
    昨天晚上的文化宫像诗和画的世界一样，在五光十色的灯光照耀下，到处可以看到工人们自己创作的诗和画，在十五个诗廊和画廊里展出的四千多件诗画中，可以看到工人们的聪明才智和他们豪迈的感情，今天，工人阶级不但是劳动者，也是最出色的画家和诗人。参观的人们在一首诗前停住了，一个老工人情不自尽的朗诵了起来：红旗迎着东风飘，六亿人民志气高，一穷二白闹革命，干劲冲天入云霄，赛似巨龙舞乾坤，高山河水齐让道，若问巨龙舞多快，二十年里程一日到。这个老工人刚念完，人群中爆发出了一阵热烈的喝采声：“写得好，太棒了！”在石景山发电厂的诗画廊里，一首诙谐的诗歌引起了参观者一阵阵地笑声，这首诗只四句：“东方巨龙天上过，西方牛儿地上颠，驾龙人儿笑哈哈，骑牛先生干瞪眼。”
    写诗作画今天已成为北京工人生活中平常的事情了。
    周扬同志昨晚观看了工人们的演出和诗画创作，他对工人们的创作才能称赞不已。
    夜深了，晚会还在进行着。当我们离开文化宫渐渐远去的时候，还听到工人们断断续续的歌声：
    沿着党的总路线
    迈开跃进的脚步
    乘着理想的火箭
    我们飞奔向前
    跨过大江，越过高山
    把困难丢在一边……
