Human Hell – Taiwan

    In Taipei Where People Suffer
    Fang Yuanhui
    Taipei is the largest city in Taiwan. This place, with a population of over 770,000, has been reduced to a state of misery under the dark rule of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. "Living in Taipei is extremely difficult."
    The "housing shortage" in Taipei is well-known. In fact, it is not accurate to call it a "housing shortage," because Taipei newspapers publish various advertisements for rental housing every day. For those who can afford the high rents, housing is not "scarce," and housing is even less "scarce" for senior officials of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The Chiang Kai-shek clique has been shouting for several years that it wants to establish a "National Housing Construction Committee" to solve the housing shortage in Taipei. As a result, "housing" has not been built, but the so-called "housing construction loans" have long been plundered by Kuomintang officials, who use them to build luxurious houses for themselves or increase their deposits in foreign banks.
    It is also very difficult for ordinary citizens of Taipei to find a place to live in the remote streets and alleys. A room of only about two square meters in the city, just enough to accommodate a person, requires a monthly rent of 120 to 250 Taiwan dollars. This amount is equal to one-third to one-half of the monthly salary of an ordinary worker, clerk, or staff member. It is very common for ordinary citizens to squeeze several family members into a small house, with seven or eight people sleeping on one bed.
    However, the most unfortunate are those poor citizens and small vendors who are crowded into so-called "illegal buildings." Because they have no money to rent houses, they can only build shacks by the roadside, next to small rivers, or on open spaces to live in. The Chiang Kai-shek clique believes that they obstruct the "view of the American allies" and sends police every day to force them to demolish their homes. Many people have been displaced in the process of "demolition." At present, there are more than 23,700 such so-called "illegal buildings" in Taipei, and about 150,000 people live in these shacks throughout Taipei. They are constantly at risk of being driven out of their homes by the Chiang Kai-shek clique police and wandering the streets.
    "Living in Taipei is extremely difficult." This is a popular saying among the citizens of Taipei.
    "Garbage piles up like mountains, and stinking water is like a river"
    The Chiang Kai-shek clique levies heavy sanitation taxes on the citizens of Taipei. However, the cleaning and sanitation equipment is very poor, there are very few sanitation workers, and their treatment is low. Under the management of the Taipei City Health Bureau of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, Taipei has become a "stinky city."
    Taipei produces more than 500 tons of garbage every day, but only more than 400 tons can be transported away every day. The remaining garbage is piled up everywhere, and flies are everywhere. The residents are even more troubled by the excrement in Taipei. The city averages more than 700 tons of night soil every day, but there are only 28 night soil trucks. One-third of Taipei's excrement often cannot be cleaned up in time. After every heavy rain, sewage flows everywhere, and feces and urine flood the streets and alleys, making them dirty and smelly.
    Taiwanese newspapers describe Taipei as: "Garbage piles up like mountains, and stinking water is like a river."
    Such "Air Raid Shelters"
    The Chiang Kai-shek clique forces every household in Taipei to pay for the construction of air-raid shelters, using this as an excuse to extort money from the citizens. At present, these air-raid shelters have become places for hiding dirt and filth in Taipei, good places for breeding flies and mosquitoes, and some have even served as temporary toilets. Those air-raid shelters in remote areas have become lairs for robbers, thieves, and hooligans to gather, carrying out murders, rapes, and various criminal activities. Not long ago, Taipei cracked down on a theft gang called "Alliance of Life and Death." Its seven criminals had been hiding in air-raid shelters for a long time, committing 27 consecutive crimes.
    Thieves Run Rampant
    Recently, a masked lone bandit robbed several families in Taipei at gunpoint overnight. Those who were robbed included Zhong Jiaoguang, a professor at Taiwan University, as well as a bookstore owner and a family member of a student studying abroad. The professor who was robbed had been robbed by thieves in the past and had also received a blackmail letter.
    In Taipei, hooligans, thugs, and bandits even run rampant in broad daylight. Various robberies and extortions occur constantly. On Movie Street, the most bustling street in Taipei, a clerk named Hu Songsheng was kidnapped by a group of gangsters with knives to an alley and extorted money after watching a movie during the day in front of the movie theater.
    "The Mayor Eats Fish" – Poor People Commit Suicide
    Huang Qirui, the "Mayor of Taipei" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, has a lavish mansion. The monthly expenditure on "eating" fish and shrimp in this mansion amounts to 12,000 Taiwan dollars, all of which are reimbursed from municipal public funds.
    12,000 Taiwan dollars can buy more than 1,000 catties of fish and shrimp in Taipei. No matter how big the appetites of Huang Qirui and his sons and daughters are, they cannot eat so much. "Eating fish" has also become one of the methods of corruption for this "mayor." If "eating fish" is like this, other things can be imagined.
    In Taipei, there are thousands of large and small lavish mansions of high-ranking Kuomintang bureaucrats. These mansions are vastly different from the more than 20,000 "illegal buildings" and tens of thousands of slum dwellings in the city. "Behind the vermillion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, there are corpses of those who have frozen to death," is a true reflection of Taipei today.
    In Taipei, how many people have fallen into unemployment and poverty, struggling on the line of hunger and death? And how many kind old men and women, when they have no way out, commit suicide by poisoning, hanging, drowning, or jumping into wells, or lying on railway tracks? Recently, an old man named Yu Haishu, 59 years old, died of poisoning because he had been unemployed for a long time and was ill, had no food to eat, and had no money to see a doctor. Not long ago, Taiwanese newspapers reported that a 16-year-old girl had to shoulder the burden of supporting a family of six because her father had been ill and unemployed for a long time. Later, she herself also became unemployed because the factory closed down, and the whole family had been without food for many days. This 16-year-old girl finally committed suicide in despair.

### 在民不聊生的台北

    在民不聊生的台北
    方元慧
    台北市是台湾最大的城市。这个拥有七十七万多人口的地方，在美帝国主义和蒋介石集团的黑暗统治下，弄得民不聊生。“台北居，大不易”
    台北市闹“房荒”是很有名的。其实说是“房荒”并不确切，因为在台北的报纸上，每天都刊登着各式各样出租房屋的广告。能够出得起高昂租金的人，房屋并不“荒”，蒋介石集团高级官吏的房屋更不“荒”。蒋介石集团空喊了好几年，说要成立“国民住宅兴建委员会”，来解决台北市的房荒问题。结果“住宅”未建，所谓“建屋贷款”却早被国民党官员们刮光了，用来替他们自己建筑豪华的住宅，或者增加在外国银行的存款。
    台北市一般市民，想在僻街小巷找个安身之地，也大不容易。市内一间约两平方公尺大的仅能容身的房间，每月需要租金一百二十到二百五十元台币。这个数目等于一个普通工人、店员或职员月薪的三分之一到一半。一般市民，一家数口挤在一间小房子里，七、八个人睡一张床，都是极平常的事情。
    然而，遭遇最不幸的，还是那些挤在所谓“违章建筑”中的贫苦市民和小摊贩。他们因为没有钱去租房屋住，只能在马路边、小河旁或空地上搭个茅棚来栖身。蒋介石集团却认为他们妨碍“美国盟友的观瞻”，天天派警察催逼他们拆迁。许多人在“拆迁”中弄得流离失所。目前，台北市这类所谓“违章建筑”有两万三千七百多间，整个台北市约有十五万人聚居在这些茅屋中。他们时时都有可能被蒋介石集团警察赶得无家可归，流浪街头。
    “台北居，大不易。”这是在台北市民中间流行的一句话。
    “垃圾如山积，臭水似河流”
    蒋介石集团向台北市民征收苛重的卫生捐税。可是，清洁卫生的设备很差，卫生工人很少，而且待遇低微。在蒋介石集团台北市卫生局的管理下，台北市已经成为一个“臭市”。
    台北市每天有垃圾五百多吨，而每天只能运走四百多吨。剩下的垃圾满街乱堆，到处苍蝇密密麻麻。提起台北市的粪便，更使居民们困扰不堪。全市每天平均有七百多吨水肥粪便，但是只有二十八辆粪车。台北市的粪便经常有三分之一无法及时清理。每逢大雨过后，处处污水横流，粪尿泛滥，大街小巷又脏又臭。
    台湾报纸描绘台北市是：“垃圾如山积，臭水似河流。”如此“防空洞”
    蒋介石集团强迫台北市民家家户户出钱建筑防空洞，借此向市民敲诈勒索。目前这些防空洞都成了台北市的藏污纳垢之所，苍蝇、蚊子滋生的好地方，有些还充当了临时厕所。那些处在偏僻地区的防空洞，更成了强盗、小偷、流氓哨聚的巢穴，进行杀人、强奸和各种犯罪勾当的场所。不久前，台北市破获了一个名叫“生死盟”的盗窃集团，它的七名罪犯就是长期以来以防空洞为藏身的地方，连续犯案二十七次。
    盗贼横行
    最近，一个蒙面的独行大盗持枪在台北市一夜之间连续抢了几个家庭。被抢劫的有台湾大学教授钟皎光，还有一个书店老板和一个留学生家属等。那个被抢的教授，过去就曾被盗贼洗劫过，并且还收到了一封勒索的信。
  在台北市，流氓、恶棍和匪徒甚至白昼横行。各种抢劫和勒索的事件不断发生。在台北最热闹的街道电影街上，一个叫胡松盛的小职员，白天看电影后，在电影院门前竟被一群歹徒持刀挟至小巷勒索钱财。
    “市长吃鱼”  贫民自杀
    蒋介石集团“台北市市长”黄启瑞，有一个阔气的公馆。这个公馆每月“吃”鱼虾的开支，达一万二千元台币，都在市政公费中报销。
    一万二千台币，在台北可以购买一千多斤鱼虾。黄启瑞和他的公子小姐们胃口再大，也吃不了这么多。“吃鱼”也成为这个“市长”贪污的手法之一了。“吃鱼”如此，其他不问可知。
    在台北市，有着成千个大大小小的国民党高级官僚的阔气公馆。这些公馆和市内两万多户“违章建筑”和几万户贫民窟的住宅，有着天壤之别。“朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨”，正好是今日台北的写照。
    在台北市，有多少人陷入了失业和贫困，在饥饿和死亡线上挣扎啊？又有多少个善良的老人和妇女，在走头无路的时候，服毒、上吊、投河、或者跳井、卧轨自杀啊？最近，一个五十九岁的老人余海树，因为长期失业而又患病，没有饭吃，更没有钱治病，最后背着亲人服毒身死了。不久前的台湾报纸上，报道了一个十六岁的女孩子，因为父亲长期患病、失业，由她负起了一家六口人的生活重担。后来，她自己也因为工厂倒闭而失业了，全家断粮多日。这个十六岁的女孩子，终于在绝望中也走上了自杀的道路。  （新华社）
