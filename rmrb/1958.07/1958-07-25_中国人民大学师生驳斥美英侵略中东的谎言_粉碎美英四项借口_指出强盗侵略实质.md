Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd News: At a rally held today by over two thousand teachers and students of Renmin University of China to protest against the US-British imperialist aggression in the Middle East, they systematically refuted the various excuses and lies used by the US and British pirates to invade Lebanon and Jordan, targeting Eisenhower's speech on July 15th and Macmillan's speech in the British Parliament on July 17th, demanding that they immediately get out of the Middle East.

The teachers and students said that the first excuse of the US and British aggressors for sending troops to the Middle East was the so-called "protection of overseas Chinese." Eisenhower said that there were 2,500 American overseas Chinese in Lebanon, and the US invasion of Lebanon was to protect American overseas Chinese. They questioned Eisenhower: From which international law did he find this principle? International law allows a country to protect its overseas Chinese through its embassies and consulates stationed there. When the lives and property of its overseas Chinese are indeed threatened, it can only request protection through diplomatic channels, and it must never use this excuse to send troops into the territory of another country. Moreover, the safety of American overseas Chinese in Lebanon was not threatened in any way. According to Eisenhower's logic, any country with overseas Chinese stationed in another country will be able to enter the territory of another country on this basis. There are also many foreign overseas Chinese in the United States. Can these countries send troops into the United States? The teachers and students angrily pointed out that the US and British bandits sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan was not to protect overseas Chinese, but a naked act of interfering in other countries' internal affairs and a piratical act of invading other countries' territories. This kind of banditry inherited the mantle of Hitler and Tojo. In July 1936, Hitler used the excuse of "protecting the lives and property of Germans" to carry out armed intervention in the Spanish people's revolution. During the "May 30th" massacre in 1925, Japanese imperialism also sent troops into Jinan under the pretext of protecting "the safety of Japanese lives and property," and carried out a brutal massacre of the Chinese people. When Japan invaded China in 1931, 1932, and 1937, it also created similar excuses. From this, it can be seen that Eisenhower's statement that sending troops was "to protect overseas Chinese" more clearly exposes his jackal face.

The teachers and students said that the second excuse of the US and British aggressors was the so-called "aggression" and "indirect aggression" existing in Lebanon and Jordan. What are their so-called "aggression" and "indirect aggression"? According to Eisenhower and Macmillan, it is "creating internal chaos and overthrowing the current regime." Eisenhower even shamelessly cited the great revolutionary victories of the Chinese people and the Czechoslovak people as examples. This is truly despicable and extremely shameless. The teachers and students angrily demanded that Eisenhower answer: Was the American Revolutionary War an "aggression" and "indirect aggression" launched by the Americans against the then British rulers? In your mind, did Washington and Jefferson also become criminals who invaded Britain? Modern international law and the United Nations Charter recognize that the people of every country have the right to self-determination and the freedom to choose their own government. The Atlantic Charter, which the US and British governments personally signed, also recognizes that "the two countries respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live." Is the revolutionary act of the Chinese people, the Czechoslovak people, and the Middle Eastern people freely "choosing their own form of government" called aggression? And your unprovoked invasion of other countries' territories and blatant interference in other countries' internal affairs, is that called non-aggression? The teachers and students pointed out that Eisenhower and Macmillan's black-and-white reversal is just a "thief crying 'stop thief'" rascal technique, which cannot conceal their jackal faces in the slightest.

The teachers and students said that the third excuse of the US and British bandits is to exercise the so-called "inherent right of self-defense" in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. However, the premise of "self-defense" must be the existence of external attacks and aggression. Who in Lebanon, Jordan, and all the Middle Eastern countries is attacking and aggressing the United States and Britain? The teachers and students said that this is like a bandit holding a gun and blocking someone else's door, while shouting "self-defense." Imperialist elements use the excuse of so-called "collective self-defense," but there is no so-called "collective self-defense" premise in Lebanon and Jordan at all. This point has also been acknowledged by United Nations observers and United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld. The aggressors' misappropriation of the name of "self-defense" to carry out aggression against other countries is a familiar trick of bandits to us Chinese people. In 1931 and 1932, Japanese fascists invaded Northeast China under the so-called name of "self-defense." In the Sino-US talks, the US government also shamelessly proposed to exercise the so-called "self-defense" right over our country's territory of Taiwan.

The last excuse for the US and British imperialists to invade the Middle East is that they sent troops because they accepted the "invitation" of the reactionary governments of Lebanon and Jordan. This is even more of a shameless deceptive trick. We Chinese people will never forget the past evil deeds of some traitors in our country who led wolves into the house and "invited" imperialist masters to massacre the Chinese people. The Shamun and Hussein governments are just like some traitors in our country in the past. They are criminals of the country and the people. This point, the US and British imperialists themselves have also confessed: Whether it is the Shamun government or the Hussein government, they are extremely unpopular, and are in precarious situations under the opposition of their own people. In Lebanon, this "invitation" was even opposed by the Speaker of the Parliament and more than half of the members of Parliament. In fact, this "invitation" is just an ugly drama played by traitors under the pressure of US and British imperialism.

At the meeting, Liu Ding, deputy director of the International Law Research Office of the Law Department, made a systematic speech. Wu Dakun, professor of the Economics Department, Su Xing, associate professor, Sha Ting, teacher of the Foreign General History Teaching and Research Section, Huang Hanjiang, a sophomore student of the Philosophy Department, and many others also spoke. They and all the teachers and student representatives solemnly protested against the US-British imperialist interference in the internal affairs of the Arab people, and demanded that the US and British aggressors immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan!

    中国人民大学师生驳斥美英侵略中东的谎言
    粉碎美英四项借口　指出强盗侵略实质
    新华社23日讯　中国人民大学师生代表二千多人在今天举行的抗议美英帝国主义侵略中东的大会上，针对7月15日艾森豪威尔的演说和7月17日麦克米伦在英国议会的讲话，系统地驳斥了美英两国海盗侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的种种借口与谎言，要求他们立即从中东滚出去。
    师生们说，美英侵略者出兵中东的第一个借口是所谓“护侨”，艾森豪威尔说在黎巴嫩有二千五百个美国侨民，美国侵入黎巴嫩是为了保护美国侨民。他们质问艾森豪威尔：他是从哪个国际法上找到这条原则的？国际法允许一个国家通过自己派驻在当地的使领馆保护自己的侨民。当自己侨民的生命财产安全的确受到威胁时，也只能通过外交途径要求保护，决不能以这个借口派兵进入别国的领土。何况美国在黎巴嫩的侨民的安全并未受到任何威胁。依照艾森豪威尔的这种逻辑，任何一个在别国驻有侨民的国家，都将可以借此进入别国领土。美国境内也有很多外国侨民，这些国家是否都可以派兵进入美国？师生们愤怒地指出，美英强盗出兵黎巴嫩、约旦，并不是什么护侨，而是赤裸裸地干涉别国内政、侵略别国领土的海盗行为。这种强盗行径是继承了希特勒和东条的衣钵。希特勒在1936年7月曾以“保护德国人的生命财产”为借口对西班牙的人民革命进行武装干涉。1925年“五卅”惨案时，日本帝国主义也是借口保护“日本人的生命财产的安全”派兵进入济南，对中国人民进行了惨酷的屠杀。1931、1932、1937年日本侵略中国时，也制造了类似的借口。由此可见，艾森豪威尔出兵是“为了护侨”的说法，更加清楚地暴露出了他的豺狼嘴脸。
    师生们说，美英侵略者的第二个借口，是在黎巴嫩和约旦存在着所谓“侵略”和“间接侵略”。什么是他们所谓的“侵略”和“间接侵略”呢，按照艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦的说法，就是“制造内部混乱，推翻现政权”，艾森豪威尔更无耻地举出中国人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民的伟大革命胜利作为例子，这真是卑鄙透顶，无耻至极。师生们愤怒地要求艾森豪威尔答复：美国独立战争是否就是美国人向当时的英国统治者发动了“侵略”和“间接侵略”？在你的心目中，华盛顿、杰弗逊难道也成为侵略英国的罪犯吗？现代国际法和联合国宪章都承认，每个国家人民有自决和自由选择自己政府的权利。美英两国政府亲自签过字的大西洋宪章也承认：“两国尊重一切人民选择其生活所在之政府的形式之权利”，难道中国人民、捷克斯洛伐克人民、中东人民自由“选择自己政府形式”的革命行为叫做侵略吗？而你们无故侵入别国领土，粗暴地干涉别国内政，倒叫做非侵略吗？师生们指出，艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦这种颠倒黑白的说法，只是“贼喊捉贼”的无赖手法，丝毫掩盖不了他们的豺狼面目。
    师生们说，美英强盗的第三个借口，是依据联合国宪章第五十一条行使所谓“自卫之固有权利”。但是“自卫”的前提必须是存在着外来的袭击与侵略。黎巴嫩、约旦和所有中东国家的人民，是谁在袭击和侵略了美国和英国呢？师生们说，这正像一个强盗，手里端着枪，堵住别人门口，口里却大喊“自卫”。帝国主义分子借口所谓进行“集体自卫”，但是，在黎巴嫩和约旦也根本不存在着所谓“集体自卫”的前提，这一点，联合国的观察员和联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德也都是曾经承认过的。侵略者盗用“自卫”名义对别国进行侵略，我们中国人民非常熟悉强盗们的这种惯技。1931年、1932年日本法西斯就曾经以所谓“自卫”名义，侵入我国东北。在中美会谈中，美国政府也曾无耻地提出要向我国领土台湾行使所谓“自卫”权。
    美英帝国主义者侵略中东的最后一个借口是，他们之所以出兵，是他们接受了黎巴嫩、约旦两个反动政府的“邀请”。这更是一种无耻的骗人手段。我们中国人民永远不能忘记，过去我国一些卖国贼引狼入室，“邀请”帝国主义主子屠杀中国人民的罪恶行为。夏蒙和侯赛因政府正如同我国过去的某些卖国贼一样，他们是国家和人民的罪人，这一点，美英帝国主义自己也已供认：无论夏蒙政府也好，侯赛因政府也好，都极其不得人心，在本国人民的反对下，已岌岌可危，而在黎巴嫩，这种“邀请”甚至遭到了国会议长和过半数议员的反对。实际上这种“邀请”只不过是在美英帝国主义压力下，由卖国贼扮演的一出丑剧罢了。
    在这个大会上，法律系国际法研究室副主任刘丁作了系统的发言，发言的还有经济系教授吴大昆，副教授苏星，外国通史教研室教员沙汀，哲学系二年级学生黄汗江等多人。他们和全体师生代表严正抗议美英帝国主义干涉阿拉伯人民的内政，要求美英侵略者立即从黎巴嫩和约旦滚出去！
