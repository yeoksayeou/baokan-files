Public and private schools should "sit on an equal footing"
Xiao Min

Since its birth, private schools have been like the little daughter-in-law in the old society, constantly criticized by people with bourgeois educational ideas, who say that it is no good, that it is not good, that it is "not up to standard," that it "cannot guarantee the quality of education," that it is "inferior," and so on. In short, in the minds of some people, private schools and state-run schools are not equal and cannot "sit on an equal footing." We must thoroughly oppose this kind of thinking.

Some people say that private schools have thatched roofs and simple equipment, and don't look like schools. This seems to be a flaw, but it is precisely its advantage. We are not opposed to building schools better, but when the economic situation of the country and the people does not yet allow every school to have high-rise buildings, thatched schools are much better than no schools at all. First of all, it can develop our country's education quickly, economically, and effectively, so that the majority of students immediately have the opportunity to study and acquire a skill to advance towards the fortress of science and culture. Secondly, many local people set up schools in accordance with local conditions and made do with whatever was available, which is in line with the principle of diligence and thrift in running schools. In such a simple and unadorned environment where one studies and works at the same time, it is also conducive to cultivating students' fine qualities of diligence, thrift, and hard work—qualities necessary for building socialism. Therefore, although those who talk about extravagance and ostentation and have bourgeois educational ideas think that such schools are insignificant, the broad masses welcome and praise them. The masses in Shaanxi Province said: "Spending a dime and three cents, a junior high school class is started; a bundle of firewood, a bundle of grass, and a good junior primary school is established." Judging whether a private school is good or bad, up to standard or not, should be based on the people's love and the people's interests.

Some people say that private schools "cannot guarantee the quality of education." What is quality? There are two views on the quality of education. Bourgeois educators limit the quality of education to the level of cultural and scientific book knowledge. As a result, the students they cultivate have low political enthusiasm, are lazy in their limbs, cannot distinguish the five grains, and despise manual labor and manual laborers. We firmly oppose this view of educational quality. We advocate that education should serve politics and serve production. We must follow the educational policy pointed out by Chairman Mao to train students to become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness. Only by training such students can we say that the quality of education is high. All state-run schools should implement this policy, and private schools should also implement this policy. As long as the policies are consistent, although many private schools study fewer courses, they have more opportunities to learn and apply what they learn. Many students not only learn cultural and scientific knowledge but also learn certain production skills and become skilled in labor. In this sense, the quality of education in private schools is not low. Of course, we are not satisfied with the current level of private schools. The quality of private schools should be improved along with the improvement of the cultural level of the people across the country in order to better meet the needs of the people.

Chairman Mao said: "Historically, new and correct things are often not recognized by the majority of people at the beginning and can only develop tortuously in struggle." The path taken by private schools is exactly like this. In the past, people treated it with cold words and sarcasm, and even obstructed and restricted its development; now this situation has undergone a fundamental change, and no one dares to openly obstruct its development. However, there are still great differences in the evaluation of private schools, especially the view that these two types of schools cannot "sit on an equal footing." More publicity and explanation are needed in the work of various localities. Private schools and state-run schools are like two legs on a person's body, and they are both integral parts of the national formal education. The idea of ​​belittling private schools must be criticized and corrected.

We must establish in people's minds the concept that private schools and state-run schools "sit on an equal footing"!

    公办民办学校应“平起平坐”
    萧敏
    民办学校从它出生以来，就好像旧社会的小媳妇一样，一直受到具有资产阶级教育思想的人们的贬责，说它这也不好，那也不好，什么“不正规”啦，“不能保证教育质量”啦，“低人一等”啦，等等。总之，在一些人的观念里，民办学校和国家办的学校是不平等的，是不能“平起平坐”的。这种思想，我们一定要彻底地反掉。
    有人说民办学校茅屋草舍，设备简陋，不像个学校样。这点，似乎是美中不足，但这也正是它的优点。我们并不反对把学校修得好一些，但是，在目前国家和人民的经济情况还不可能给每个学校都盖高楼大厦的时候，茅屋草舍的学校总比没有学校好得多。首先，它可以多快好省地发展我国的教育事业，使广大学生立即有机会求学，获得向科学文化堡垒进军的一种本领。其次，许多地方群众因地制宜，因陋就简，办起了学校，这正符合勤俭办学的原则，在这样简单朴素，一面学习、一面劳动的环境中，也有利于培养学生勤劳节俭、艰苦朴素的优良品质——建设社会主义必须具备的品质。因此，尽管那些讲阔气、讲排场，具有资产阶级教育思想的人认为这样的学校微不足道，但广大群众欢迎它，歌颂它。陕西省群众说：“花钱一角三，办个初中班；一把柴，一把草，办了个好初小”。判断民办学校是好是坏，正规不正规，要以人民的喜爱、人民的利益为依据。
    有人说民办学校“不能保证教育质量”。什么是质量？有两种教育质量观。资产阶级教育家把教育质量局限于以文化科学的书本知识高低为标准。结果培养出来的学生政治热情不高，四体不勤，五谷不分，鄙视体力劳动和体力劳动者。这种教育质量观是我们坚决反对的。我们主张教育为政治服务，为生产服务。我们要遵照毛主席指出的教育方针，把学生培养成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。能培养出这样的学生，才能算作教育质量高。一切由国家办的学校，应该执行这个方针，民办学校也应该执行这个方针。只要方针是一致的，那末，虽然许多民办学校少学几门课程，但由于它们有更多的机会边学边用，许多学生既学到文化科学知识，也学到一定的生产技术，成为劳动的能手。从这个意义上说，民办学校的教育质量并不会低。当然，我们并不满足于现在民办学校的水平。民办学校的质量应当随着全国人民的文化水平的提高而更加提高，才能更好地适应人们的要求。
    毛主席说：“历史上新的正确的东西，在开始的时候常常得不到多数人承认，只能在斗争中曲折地发展。”民办学校走过的道路正是这样的。过去人们对它冷言冷语，甚至阻挠、限制它的发展；现在这种情况已经有了根本的改变，没有人敢于公开阻碍它的发展了。但是对于民办学校的评价仍然有很大的分歧，特别是认为这两类学校不能“平起平坐”。各地在工作中还需要多做宣传解释。民办学校和国家办的学校犹如人身上的两条腿，它们都是国家正规教育的组成部分，轻视民办学校的思想必须批判和纠正。
    一定要在人们的思想上树立起民办学校和国家办的学校“平起平坐”观念！
