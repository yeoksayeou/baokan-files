Anti-Aggression Songs Resound Throughout Qingping Street
By our reporter Cen Lidan

The July sun shines brightly,
The US and Britain recklessly ignite the flames of war.
Invading Jordan and Lebanon,
Our anger surges to the clouds!
Asian and African people are of one heart,
Warning the US and British aggressors,
If you don't withdraw and get out,
We'll burn you to ashes!

　　Recently, on Qingping Street, opposite the Shamian West Bridge in Guangzhou, one can frequently hear these anti-aggression songs. The songs are so impassioned, they fill peace-loving people with high spirits.
　　Most of the residents of Qingping Street are artisans, porters, pedicab drivers, small vendors, and housewives. Many of them have never sung before, and some have only recently emerged from illiteracy. However, when they heard the news of the US and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East, everyone was filled with righteous indignation. In addition to participating in rallies, demonstrations, and protest signatures, they also used folk songs to expose the enemy's sinister plots and express the people's firm will to defend peace. Within a few days, the residents of the entire street created hundreds of folk songs against US and British aggression in the Middle East. Deng Yonglai, a congee vendor, also used his spare time while selling congee to write several folk songs, one of which said: "The United States is invading Lebanon, acting arbitrarily and unreasonably, and losing popular support... In reality, it is a paper tiger that appears strong but is weak inside. Warning the US and British aggressors, quickly get out of the Middle East, and if you don't turn back, you will surely die without a burial place." Chen Sheng, a retired old seaman, had just fallen ill on the day when 600,000 people in the city held an anti-demonstration, but he struggled to get up and wrote two folk songs to protest the imperialist aggression. He Muzhen, a sixty-year-old woman who had never sung a song in her life, was so excited when she heard the news of the US and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East that she didn't sleep all night. She and her husband stayed up all night under the lamp and wrote a dragon boat song entitled "Oppose US Aggression." When the neighborhood masses held meetings, she would put on her reading glasses, take the lyrics, and go there to sing. She said: "I am old and can't do anything else, but I want to use my singing to protest the aggressive crimes of the American bandits."
　　The Qingping Street residents' resolute opposition to war and their determination to defend peace is understandable. The older generation living on this street firmly remembers the blood debt from more than 30 years ago: on June 23, 1925, while they were working hard as usual, doing business, and raising children, gunshots suddenly came from 623 Road. British imperialism used poison gas and machine guns to massacre hundreds of our students, workers, and residents, and blood was spilled all over the streets. Now, the US and British imperialists are launching wars in the Middle East and slaughtering the people of the Middle East. They naturally feel a sense of connection. Uncle Su Xing, who once attended the funeral of the martyrs who died in the Shameen Massacre, said with gritted teeth: "The Arab people and we are all peace-loving people. We cannot stand by and watch US and British imperialism run rampant in the Middle East. We will not allow the tragic history to repeat itself in the Middle East."
　　The people living on Qingping Street have also suffered from the aggression of Japanese imperialism. When the Japanese invaders entered Guangzhou, many people on this street were forced to become displaced and separated from their families. In the years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, their lives have improved day by day. Especially in the recent socialist Great Leap Forward, industries have been established everywhere in the streets, and a literacy campaign has been launched. More than 200 people who used to rely on relief for their livelihood now all have jobs; more than 600 illiterate and semi-illiterate people can now read newspapers, write, and sing folk songs. They said: "If imperialism extends its claws to the Middle East today, it will extend them to us tomorrow. In order to defend our beautiful lives and ensure that our next generation enjoys peace forever, we must stop the aggressive actions of US and British imperialism."

### 反侵略的歌声响遍清平街

    反侵略的歌声响遍清平街
    本报记者　岑荔丹七月太阳当空照美英妄把战火烧侵略约旦黎巴嫩我们怒气冲云霄亚非人民心连心警告美英侵略军若不撤兵滚回去叫你灭亡火烧身
    广州市沙面西桥对面的清平街，最近不时可以听到这些反侵略的歌声，歌声是这么激昂，它使爱好和平的人民意气昂扬。
    居住在清平街的居民，大多数都是手工业者、搬运工人、三轮车工人、小贩和家庭妇女，他们当中不少人从来没有唱过歌，有的刚刚脱离了文盲状态。但是，当他们听到美英帝国主义侵略中东的消息后，人人义愤填膺，除了参加集会游行和抗议签名外，他们还通过民歌来揭露敌人的罪恶阴谋，表达人民保卫和平的坚强意志。全街道居民在几天内就创作了数百首反对美英侵略中东的民歌。白粥摊贩邓永来，也利用卖粥的空隙时间作了几首民歌，其中一首说：“美国侵略黎巴嫩，横行无理，失去民心……实际他是一只外强中干的纸扎老虎。警告美英侵略军，快点从中东滚出去，如果再不回头，一定死无葬身之地。”已经退休的老海员陈胜，在全市六十万人民举行反对示威游行那一天，他刚刚病了，但还是扎挣起来作了两首民歌，对帝国主义的侵略行为表示抗议。六十岁的老大娘何慕贞，一辈子都没唱过歌，当她听到美英帝国主义侵略中东的消息后，激动得一夜都没有睡着觉，和老伴连夜在灯下作了一首题为“反对美国侵略”的龙舟歌，那里的街坊群众开会，她就戴上老花眼镜，拿着歌词到那里演唱。她说：我老啦，别的做不来，但我要用我的歌声来抗议美国强盗的侵略罪行。
    清平街居民这种坚决反对战争、捍卫和平的心情，是可以理解的。居住在这条街老一辈的人都牢牢地记得三十多年前的那笔血账：1925年6月23日，当他们正在照常辛勤劳动、做买卖、带孩子的时候，枪声突然从六二三路传来，英帝国主义用毒弹、机关枪屠杀我们成百的学生、工人和居民，鲜血洒遍了街道。现在，美英帝国主义者又在中东发动战争，屠杀中东人民，他们很自然地就产生一种心连心的感情。当年曾经为沙基惨案死难烈士送过葬的苏兴老伯，咬牙切齿地说：“阿拉伯人民和我们都是爱好和平的人民，我们不能眼看美英帝国主义在中东横行，不容许悲惨的历史在中东重演。”
    居住在清平街的人们，也深受过日本帝国主义侵略的苦难。在日寇侵入广州时，这条街有许多人曾经被迫流离失所，妻离子散。解放后几年来，在党的领导下，他们的生活一天比一天改善了，特别是最近社会主义大跃进中，街道处处办了工业，开展了扫盲运动，原来有二百多人经常都要靠救济过活的，现在全都有了工作；六百多文盲和半文盲也都能够看报、写字和唱民歌了。他们说：帝国主义今天把魔爪伸到中东，明天就会伸到我们这里，为了保卫我们美好的生活，使我们的下一代永远得到安宁，我们一定要制止美英帝国主义的侵略行为。
