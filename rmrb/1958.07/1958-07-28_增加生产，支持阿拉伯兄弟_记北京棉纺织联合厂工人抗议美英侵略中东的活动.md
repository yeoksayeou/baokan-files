    Increase Production, Support Our Arab Brothers
    —Record of Beijing Cotton Textile United Factory Workers' Activities Protesting US-British Aggression in the Middle East
    
    The red indicator lights in the workshops lit up, and workers poured out of the workshops like a tide. Still in their work clothes, they automatically rushed to the square to assemble and protest the banditry of US-British imperialism. The workers angrily stated: If the aggressors dare to expand the war in the Middle East, we will never stand idly by. After in-depth discussions, the factory's employees decided to protest US-British imperialist aggression with practical actions. The workers said that accelerating the pace of national construction by one step is equivalent to strengthening the forces of peace by one point. In this large-scale cotton textile factory with more than 14,000 employees, from dawn to dusk every day, employees continuously held rallies and parades, supporting the just struggle of the Arab people. The entire factory was seething, and anti-aggression poems, cartoons, and protest letters written and drawn by workers were posted everywhere. The workers were constantly vigilant and closely watching the progress of the situation in the Middle East. In the past few days, the factory's workers have automatically formed more than 500 reading groups, and newspaper sales have increased sevenfold compared to normal.
    At the anti-aggression meeting in the workshop, the flames of anger burned in the hearts of every worker. Late at night, fine yarn worker Ming Shurong returned to her quiet and comfortable home after the demonstration meeting, unable to fall asleep for a long time. When she remembered the suffering of the semi-colonial people she had tasted since childhood, she especially understood the justice of the oppressed and ruled people in their struggle for freedom and independence. Unable to suppress the excitement in her heart, she said to the baby sleeping beside her: "Tomorrow, Mom will use doubled efforts to eliminate the defects on the fine yarn to ensure the quality of the yarn." She believes that eliminating one defect in the fine yarn increases the forces of peace by one point. The next morning, just as dawn was breaking, more than an hour before work, she thought she had arrived early, but when she walked into the workshop, she saw that more than thirty workers were already busily working to support the Arab people. Her enthusiasm was even greater. That day, she eliminated a total of two hundred and eighty defects, nine times more than usual.
    Every day, during production breaks and rest periods, people can always see a thin, middle-aged worker angrily telling young workers and their families about the atrocities of US imperialism. He is Chen Jiyao, an advanced producer and maintenance worker. Before liberation, he worked in Shanghai, where imperialist elements often kicked and beat him. In that dark era, he lived an inhuman life. Now, past events are intertwined in his mind, forming a raging fire of hatred. When Chen Jiyao read in the newspaper that the US imperialists wanted to enslave the Lebanese people again, his old and new hatreds erupted like a volcano. Although his old stomach ailment had flared up again in the past few days, and the doctor told him to rest, he anxiously said: The Arab people are suffering from the aggression of US-British bandits, how can I rest peacefully? He often excitedly said to his apprentices: The imperialists want to use the whip that once whipped us to whip the Arab people again, we workers will not agree first, we must support the just struggle of our Arab brothers. In this week, workers' letters of determination, support letters, and guarantees flew like snowflakes to the Party Committee office, and the raging fire ignited a surge of production leap forward. In just a few days, the factory's young workers formed more than fifty youth production shock teams. By the 25th, 96% of the workers had not made a single mistake. In the past, workers in the weaving workshop's Class B operated thirty-two machines per person. Now, the workers have improved their work methods, and the number of machines operated by each worker has increased like a kite with a broken string. Now the average number of machines operated by the entire class has jumped to sixty, and the highest number reached one hundred and twenty.
    The just struggle of the Arab people is not isolated, and the Chinese workers and the people of the whole country will always support them. Listen, this is the warning issued by the cotton mill workers to the US-British bandits:
    "For bandits, use knives and guns,
    For jackals, use ropes.
    We use the arrows of new records,
    To pierce the chest of the greedy wolf."

    增加生产，支持阿拉伯兄弟
    ——记北京棉纺织联合厂工人抗议美英侵略中东的活动
    新华社记者　周定舫
    车间里的红色指示灯亮了，下班的工人像潮水一样涌出车间，他们工作服还没有脱掉，就自动地赶到广场上集会抗议美英帝国主义的强盗行为。工人们愤怒地表示：如果侵略者胆敢在中东扩大战争，我们决不袖手旁观。全厂职工经过深入讨论，决定以实际行动抗议美英帝国主义侵略中东。工人们说，祖国的建设步伐加快一步，等于和平力量壮大一分。在这个拥有一万四千多个职工的大型棉纺织厂里，每天从清晨到傍晚，职工们都陆续不断地举行集会、游行，声援阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，整个工厂都在沸腾着，到处贴满了工人们绘写的反侵略的诗歌、漫画和抗议书。工人们时刻提高着警惕，密切地注视着中东局势的进展。几天来，全厂工人已经自动成立了五百多个读报小组，报纸的销售量比平常增加了七倍。
    在车间的反侵略大会上，愤怒的火焰在每个工人的心中燃烧着。深夜，细纱工人明淑荣开完示威大会回到安静、舒适的住宅里，久久不能入睡。当她想起从小就尝够了半殖民地人民的苦难时，她格外懂得被压迫、被统治的人民进行自由、独立斗争的正义性。她压不住心头的激动，对着睡在身旁的婴儿说：“妈妈明天要用加倍的干劲，去消灭细纱上的次点，来保证纱的质量。”她认为消灭细纱一个次点，就增加了一分和平力量。第二天清晨，天刚蒙蒙亮，离上班还有一个多小时，她满以为来得早了，当她走进车间，看到已经有三十多个工人在为支援阿拉伯人民忙碌地劳动着。她的劲头更足了，这一天她总共消灭了二百八十个次点，比往日增加了九倍。
    每天，在生产间隙时间和休息时间，人们总可以看到一个瘦瘦的中年工人，在向青年工人和家属们愤怒地讲述美帝的暴行。他是先进生产者、保全工人陈纪耀。解放以前，他在上海做工，帝国主义分子经常对他拳打脚踢，在那黑暗的时代，他过着非人的生活。现在，往事又在他的脑海中交织成仇恨的怒火。当陈纪耀从报上看到美帝又想去奴役黎巴嫩人民的时候，他的旧恨新仇像爆发了的火山一样。虽然他的老胃病在这几天又发了，医生要他休息，可是他着急地说：阿拉伯人民正在遭受美英强盗的侵略，我怎么能安心休息呢？他常常激动地和他的徒工们说：帝国主义想用曾经抽打过我们的鞭子，再去抽打阿拉伯人民，我们工人首先不答应，我们要支援阿拉伯兄弟的正义斗争，在这一星期里，工人们写的决心书、声援书和保证书像雪片似地飞向党委会办公室，熊熊的烈火燃起了生产跃进的热潮。全厂的青年工人在几天内就成立了五十多个青年生产突击队。到25日止，96％的工人都没有出过一次差错。织布车间乙班工人过去每人操纵三十二台机器，现在，工人们改进了工作方法，增加操纵机器台数的数字，就像断了线的气球，一直上升，现在全班工人平均操纵机器的台数已跃进到六十台，最高的一个工人达到了一百二十台。
    阿拉伯人民的正义斗争不是孤立的，中国的工人和全国人民永远支持着他们。听，这是棉纺厂工人向美英强盗发出的警告：
    “对强盗要用刀枪，
    对豺狼要用绳索。
    我们用新纪录的箭头，
    射穿野心狼的胸膛。”
