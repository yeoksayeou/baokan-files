    Talking About Conditions
    Ying Lin
    There is a type of person who, no matter what work they do, is very particular about conditions. Only when all conditions are met will they start working. However, the conditions are never as complete as they imagine, so they lack enthusiasm in their work, moving as slowly as a snail.
    When doing work, one cannot ignore conditions, but one needs to pay attention to them comprehensively. For every task, there are both favorable and unfavorable conditions. It is not good to only see the favorable conditions and not the unfavorable ones! It is even worse to only see the unfavorable conditions and not the favorable ones. This will cause people to bow their heads before difficulties and lose the courage to move forward. Moreover, it should be further recognized that while favorable and unfavorable conditions are contradictory, they can be transformed into each other. The decisive factor in promoting this transformation is the subjective initiative of people. As long as people have the spirit of striving for the top and are filled with revolutionary zeal, unfavorable conditions can be transformed into favorable ones. Comrade Liu Shaoqi once said in his report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress: "Things are done by people, and the subjective initiative of the masses is a great driving force."
    The facts have indeed proven this: Since the autumn of last year, many places have experienced severe droughts, which is undoubtedly a very unfavorable condition for agricultural production. Many people became pessimistic, believing that under such harsh conditions, it would be impossible not only to achieve a bumper harvest of summer crops, but even to strive for an ordinary year. What is the reality? The newspapers have already told us that farmers have achieved not an ordinary year, but an unprecedented bumper harvest of summer crops, with grain production soaring by more than 35 billion jin, a growth rate of nearly 60%. There are many reasons for the emergence of this great miracle, but the most fundamental point is that the vast number of farmers, under the leadership of the Party, were full of energy and gave full play to their subjective initiative. They no longer passively waited for the gifts of nature, but actively and tenaciously seized wealth from nature. In order to overcome the threat of severe drought, they braved the severe cold, day and night, to build countless water conservancy projects. In order to sow even when it didn't rain, they carried water, load by load, to distant fields and implemented watering point sowing. In the face of the heroic deeds of our heroic people, nature had to yield, and the emergence of the harvest miracle was in accordance with the laws of nature.
    In fact, examples of great leaps forward similar to the summer grain harvest are constantly emerging on the industrial front and the cultural and scientific fronts as well. So why do some people always like to emphasize that objective conditions are not met? What exactly is going on? It turns out that these people's thinking has a great deal of one-sidedness. When they make plans and do work, they often only see the unfavorable conditions and not the favorable ones; and they always exaggerate the unfavorable conditions and minimize the favorable ones. This leads to a major defeat in spirit first. These people also make the mistake of ideological rigidity, treating conditions as fixed and unchanging things, thinking that favorable conditions will always be favorable, and unfavorable conditions will always be unfavorable. These people have forgotten the most important truth, which is that "things are done by people," which is the great role of people's subjective initiative. In this way, in the face of difficulties, they can only be helpless, at a loss, and resigned to fate. In order to change their current backward situation in their work and catch up with the advanced, these comrades should quickly overcome this ideological rigidity and one-sidedness, and learn to observe problems using the method of dialectical materialism.

    谈条件
    应麟
    有一种人，不论做什么工作，都非常讲究条件，只有各种条件都具备了，他们才动手去做。但是，条件总不如他们想像的完备，因此，他们做工作就没有劲头，好像蜗牛一样地缓步而行。
    做工作不能不注意条件，但是，需要全面地来注意条件。做什么工作，都有有利的条件和不利的条件。只看到有利的条件，而看不到不利的条件，不好！只看到不利的条件而看不到有利的条件，更不好。这样会使人在困难前低头，丧失前进的勇气。不仅如此，还应进一步看到，有利和不利固然是对立的，但又是可以互相转化的；促成这种转化的决定性因素，就是人的主观能动作用。只要人有力争上游的精神，鼓足了革命的干劲，不利条件也可以转化为有利条件。刘少奇同志在“八大”二次会议的报告中就曾经这样说过：“事在人为，人民群众的主观能动性是一个伟大的动力。”
    事实正是这样证明着的：从去年秋季以来，许多地方都发生了严重的干旱现象，这对农业生产来说不能不是一个十分不利的条件。也曾有不少人悲观起来，认为在这样恶劣的条件下，不要说夏粮作物的大丰收，就是要争取一个平常的年景，也是办不到的。事实究竟怎样呢？报纸已经告诉了我们，农民在夏粮作物方面争取到的不是平常年景，而是空前未有的大丰收，粮食产量猛增三百五十多亿斤，增长速度近60％。这个伟大的奇迹的出现，固然有多种多样的原因，但是最基本的一点，就是广大农民在党的领导之下鼓足了干劲，充分发挥了主观能动性。他们不再是消极地等待老天爷的赐予，而是积极、顽强地向大自然夺取财富。为了战胜严重干旱的威胁，他们曾经冒着严寒，不分日夜地修起了无数的水利工程。为了不下雨也要播种，他们把水一担一担地担到很远的地里，实行浇水点种。在我们的英雄人民的英雄行为面前，大自然也就不能不屈服，丰收奇迹的出现也就是合乎规律的。
    其实，类似夏粮丰收这样大跃进的事例，在工业战线和文化、科学战线上，也在不断地出现着。那末为什么还有人总是喜欢强调客观条件不具备呢？这究竟是怎么回事呢？原来这些人的思想有很大的片面性，他们订计划、做工作，常常只看到不利的条件，看不到有利的条件；而且总是夸大了不利条件，缩小了有利的条件。这样首先在精神上打了一个大败仗。这些人还犯了思想僵化的毛病，把条件看作了固定不变的东西，以为有利的条件就永远有利，不利的条件就永远不利。这些人忘掉了一条最重要的真理，就是“事在人为”，就是人的主观能动性的伟大作用。这样，他们在困难的面前，就只能是束手无策，一筹莫展，听天由命了。这些同志为了改变他们目前在工作上的落后状况，赶上先进，应该迅速克服这种思想上的僵化和片面性，学会用辩证唯物论的方法观察问题。
