How to Prevent Food Poisoning
    Chen Qiying

    Food hygiene is an important part of overall hygiene work, a major matter concerning the daily lives and health of millions of people.

    Since the beginning of summer this year, food poisoning incidents have been occurring continuously in various places. In April this year, a commune in Baoshan County, Shanghai, caused 231 cases of food poisoning due to the sale of beef from diseased and dead cattle. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Railways for May and June this year, a total of 11 collective food poisoning incidents occurred on the entire railway system, with 673 people poisoned.

    The main cause of food poisoning is eating meat from diseased or dead animals or spoiled and deteriorated meat, as well as other unclean food. These foods may be contaminated by chemical toxins, or bacteria may have multiplied and produced toxins, or acute infections may occur due to containing large numbers of bacteria. Of course, sometimes poisoning can also be caused by accidentally eating toxic plants and animals.

    Food poisoning can be divided into two main categories: bacterial food poisoning and non-bacterial food poisoning.

    Bacterial food poisoning includes:

    (1) Poisoning caused by Salmonella: This is the most common type of bacterial food poisoning. These bacteria are normally found in the intestines of many animals and in water and other foods contaminated by animal feces. When food storage hygiene conditions are poor or hygiene is not observed during the production process, it may be contaminated by these bacteria and cause illness. In particular, animal foods such as meat, shrimp, crab, poultry, and eggs are more susceptible to contamination.

    (2) Poisoning caused by Staphylococcus: Staphylococcus can multiply in large quantities in food at suitable temperatures, while secreting a toxin that acts on the human gastrointestinal tract. It is most suitable for growth and reproduction in milk and dairy products; followed by meat and fish; it can also grow in cooked plant-based foods such as leftovers. If contaminated food is stored in a warm environment, bacteria will multiply rapidly and produce enterotoxins. This toxin is quite heat-resistant, and poisoning will occur after eating food containing the toxin that has not been thoroughly cooked.

    (3) Botulism: Clostridium botulinum is an anaerobic bacterium with spores. Spores in a completely oxygen-free environment (such as inside canned food or deep inside blocks of salted meat), at a suitable temperature, will transform into bacilli and multiply in large numbers. When Clostridium botulinum multiplies, it produces an exotoxin, which is botulinum toxin. If hygiene is not observed during the food manufacturing process, it is easy to be contaminated by the spores of Clostridium botulinum, and when conditions are suitable, the spores will turn into bacilli and reproduce, producing toxins. Eating this kind of food will cause poisoning. The human body is extremely sensitive to botulinum toxin, and eating even a tiny amount can cause poisoning or even death.

    Non-bacterial food poisoning includes:

    (1) Food poisoning caused by toxic foods: Some things themselves contain toxins and should not be listed as "food", but are mistaken for food, such as many poisonous mushrooms, poisonous lentils, and poisonous weeds; the viscera or other tissues of some animals are toxic, such as the blood, viscera, and eggs of puffer fish. In some areas, the roe of cod, mullet, and mackerel is toxic; the flesh and skin glands of sea eels are toxic. The toxins in the above-mentioned foods are stable and not destroyed by heat. After eating, they can cause abdominal cramps, collapse, and death.

    (2) Poisoning caused by chemical toxins: The reason why chemical impurities seep into food is generally because the food is in contact with unhygienic containers for a long time, or insecticides or other chemical agents are mistakenly mixed into the food. Among inorganic compounds, poisoning from lead, zinc, copper, and arsenic is more common. When these metallic chemical toxins enter food, people will also be poisoned after eating it. For example, when cooking, if highly acidic foods are placed in utensils coated with lead glaze, the lead will enter the food. Or if copper utensils that are not tin-plated or poorly tin-plated are used to store acidic foods, the copper and acid will undergo a chemical change, producing a compound (copper salt) that enters the food, and people will experience chemical food poisoning after eating this kind of food.

    In order to prevent food poisoning, attention must be paid to food hygiene, and the following points should be observed:

    First, when purchasing food, you should carefully select and buy fresh food ingredients. You should not buy livestock that died of disease and meat without the slaughterhouse inspection stamp, spoiled and deteriorated food, vegetables that are not fresh or have been stored for too long, fish, wild vegetables, and wild mushrooms of unknown origin or rare varieties.

    Second, prevent fish, meat, shrimp, clams, crabs, etc. from being contaminated before and after cooking. These foods should be washed clean before cooking, cooked thoroughly, placed in clean containers after cooking, and prevent flies, cockroaches, rats, etc. from coming into contact with the food.

    Third, store uncooked and cooked foods separately to prevent them from coming into contact with each other. The plates for storing raw and cooked vegetables should also be separated to prevent the bacteria on the raw vegetables from infecting the cooked vegetables. Cutting boards and knives used for cutting raw meat and fish and cutting cooked fish, meat, and raw and cooked vegetables should be used separately.

    Fourth, stored food must be placed in a cool place, preferably refrigerated. Cooked food that has been stored for more than 20 hours must be thoroughly reheated before eating.

    Fifth, before eating canned food, you must check whether the can is inflated. If the ends of the can are bulging; the inner wall of the can shows corrosion; or the contents have an abnormal color and smell, it should not be eaten. Sausages, ham, salted meat, and salted fish must be thoroughly heated (boiled or steamed thoroughly for more than half an hour).

    Sixth, develop good personal hygiene habits, regularly cut your nails and protect your skin from injury, because various suppurative diseases are a source of Staphylococcus contamination of food.

    Seventh, when food poisoning occurs, you must prohibit continuing to eat the remaining or suspected food that caused the poisoning, and immediately report it to the local health and epidemic prevention agency and ask them to assist in investigating the cause of the poisoning.

    Food poisoning is an acute disease that usually affects a large number of patients at the same time. It is more harmful to people, and the summer and autumn seasons are the seasons when these diseases are most likely to occur. Therefore, doing a good job in food hygiene and eliminating food poisoning is an urgent task. To accomplish this task, the relevant departments must cooperate closely.

    怎样防止食物中毒
    陈琦影
    饮食卫生工作是整个卫生工作的一项重要工作，是关系着千百万人民群众日常生活和人民健康的一件大事。
    今年入夏以来，各地的食物中毒事件不断发生，上海市宝山县某社于今年4月因销售病死牛肉，引起二百三十一人食物中毒事件。据铁道部今年5、6两月的不完全统计，全路共发生集体食物中毒事件十一起，中毒人数六百七十三人。
    引起食物中毒的主要原因，是吃了病死或腐臭变质的肉类及其它不洁食品。这些食物可能受化学毒物的污染，或细菌的繁殖而产生毒质，或因含有大量细菌而发生急性传染。当然，有时因误食含毒的动植物也能引起中毒。
    食物中毒可以分为两大类。一类是细菌性的食物中毒，一类是非细菌性的中毒。
    细菌性的食物中毒包括有：
    （一）沙门氏菌属引起的中毒：它是细菌性食物中毒中最常见的一种。这种细菌平常就在许多动物的肠内和被动物粪便所污染的水及其它食物中。当保存食物的卫生条件不良或制作过程中不注意卫生时，就可能受这些细菌的污染而使人发病。特别是肉、虾、蟹、家禽、蛋类、鱼等动物性食物，更易受污染。
    （二）葡萄球菌引起的中毒：葡萄球菌于适宜的温度下，在食物中能大量地繁殖，同时分泌一种毒素，这种毒素在人的胃肠道起作用。最适宜在奶和奶类制品中生长繁殖；其次是肉和鱼；也可以在剩饭菜等熟的植物性食物中生长。被污染的食物，如保存在温暖环境中，细菌便大量地繁殖，并产生肠毒素。这种毒素相当耐热，只要吃了没有经过充分煮透的含有毒素的食物后，便会中毒。
    （三）肉毒中毒：肉毒杆菌是一种有芽胞的厌气菌。芽胞在完全缺氧的环境里（如在食品罐头内或咸肉块的深部），在适合的温度下，芽胞便会转变为杆菌，并且大量繁殖。肉毒杆菌繁殖时，产生一种外毒素，就是肉毒。食品在制造过程中，如不注意清洁卫生，便易被肉毒杆菌的芽胞所污染，条件适宜时，则芽胞变为杆菌而繁殖，并产生毒素，吃了此种食物便会中毒。人体对肉毒极为敏感，吃进微小的数量便会中毒，甚至死亡。
    非细菌性的食物中毒包括有：
      （一）毒性食物引起的食物中毒：有些东西本身含有毒质，本不应列为“食物”，而被误认为食物，例如许多毒蕈、毒扁豆、毒草；有些动物的某些脏器或其它组织有毒质，例如河豚的血液、内脏及卵均有毒。有些地区的鳕鱼、梭鱼和鲭鱼的鱼子有毒；海八月鳗的肉肤腺体有毒。上述那些食品里的毒素都是稳定的，经热也不被破坏，吃下之后，腹绞痛，虚脱而死。
      （二）化学毒物引起的中毒：化学杂质渗入食品的原因，一般是因为食品长时期与不合卫生要求的容器接触，或是误将杀虫剂或其它化学药剂混入食品。在无机化合物中，铅、锌、铜及砷中毒较常见。这些金属化学性毒物进到食物里面，人吃了也会发生中毒。如在烹饪时，将酸度较高的食物盛在涂有铅釉的器皿内，铅就进入食物里。或者把没有镀锡的和锡镀得不好的铜器用来储存酸性食物，铜与酸就会起化学变化，产生一种化合物（铜盐）进到食物里面，人吃了这种食物就会发生化学性食物中毒。
      为了预防食物中毒，
  必须注意饮食卫生，应当
  做到下列几点：
    第一，采购食物时，应认真选购，要买新鲜的食品原料，凡病死的牲畜及没有盖屠宰场检印的肉类、腐败变质的食物、不新鲜及放置过久的菜蔬、来历不明或少见的鱼类、野菜、野蕈等都不应当购买。
    第二，预防鱼、肉、虾、蛤蜊、螃蟹等在烹调前后受污染。这些食品在烹调前要洗干净，煮的要透，煮后放进清洁的容器，并防止苍蝇、蟑螂、老鼠等接触食物。
    第三，将没有煮的和煮熟的食物分别保存起来，不使它们互相接触。存放生熟菜的盘子也要分开，以免生菜上面的细菌传染给熟菜。切生肉生鱼和切熟的鱼、肉及切生熟蔬菜用的砧板和刀，应当分开使用。
    第四，存放的食品，必须放在凉爽的地方，最好能冷藏。已存放二十小时以上的熟食，再吃时，必须重新热透。
    第五，吃罐头食品前，必须检查罐头是否涨气，如罐底两端凸出；罐内壁有腐蚀现象；内容物有异常的颜色和气味，不能食用。吃香肠、火腿、咸肉、咸鱼必须彻底加热（煮沸或蒸透半小时以上）。
    第六，养成良好的个人卫生习惯，常剪指甲和保护皮肤不受伤，因为各种化脓性疾病是葡萄球菌污染食物的来源。
    第七，发生食物中毒时，要禁止继续吃引起中毒所剩余的或可疑的食物，并立即报告当地卫生防疫机关，请他们协助追查中毒的原因。
    食物中毒是急性发作的疾病，一般都是同时有大量患者的，对人的危害较大，夏秋季又是最容易闹这些病的季节，所以认真做好饮食卫生工作，杜绝食物中毒是一项迫切的任务。要完成这个任务，各有关部门必须密切配合。
