Chongqing Electric News: In the past two months, Chongqing Steel Company, focusing on thoroughly implementing the General Line, has waged a resolute struggle against new right-leaning conservative thoughts, thereby ensuring the earnest implementation of the policy of "taking steel as the key link," and making production and basic construction vibrant and effective.

In mid-May, as the company's rectification movement entered its fourth stage, the company's Party Committee mobilized all employees to conduct a major review of the rectification, combined with a check on production. The review revealed that the rectification was not yet thorough, mainly manifested in the fact that the red flag of the General Line was not firmly planted or not planted at all in many areas, new conservative ideas were rising, the leadership style had not been thoroughly transformed, and some weak links still had blind spots. In order to carry out the rectification to the end, the Chongqing Steel Company Party Committee, on the one hand, organized a 5,000-person propaganda team to vigorously promote the General Line; at the same time, using the General Line as a weapon, it launched a campaign to check measures, evaluate measures, and add measures. Through inspection and comparison, it waged a resolute struggle against new conservative ideas.

This struggle between the two lines and two ideologies of "more, faster, better, and more economically" versus "less, slower, worse, and more costly" was repeated in two rounds and was very sharp. Initially, some conservatives took advantage of the new difficulties encountered in production after the planned leap forward and stood up to "reverse the verdict." Seeing that the plan was temporarily not completed due to the failure of post-furnace work and transportation to keep up after adopting new technologies such as "three-slag tapping," they shouted "rash advance" and refused to acknowledge the previously raised targets. Upon discovering this situation, the company's Party Committee promptly put forward the slogan "Only allow going uphill, not downhill" and launched a debate among employees to fiercely counter this right-leaning conservative thought of fearing difficulties and retreating. At the same time, employees in various workshops adopted methods such as strengthening collaboration and adding measures to solve the new imbalances that had emerged in production. The main contradiction in the company's production was that steelmaking could not keep up with steel rolling. Therefore, the Technical Supply Department, the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office, and more than a dozen other units signed a production collaboration competition contract, proposing twenty-seven major projects to vigorously support and cooperate with the steelmaking workshop. In this way, right-leaning conservative thought was defeated.

However, less than a month later, when they saw that the production plan for the first half of the year had successively leaped forward eight times, and miracles such as a 100-ton furnace producing 194 tons to 200 tons of pig iron had appeared, the conservative thoughts of many people rose again in the form of complacency and relaxation. In addition, due to the establishment of regional collaboration and the proposal of the policy of "taking steel as the key link and striving for high-speed industrial development," Chongqing, as an old industrial base in the Southwest region, had a large task of manufacturing steelmaking and rolling equipment this year, and the requirements were urgent. Therefore, some people shouted "The burden is too heavy" and "Too tense," believing that the production plan had "leaped forward almost enough and cannot be repeated." In order to repel this right-leaning conservative thought, the Chongqing Steel Company Party Committee recently convened an enlarged meeting of cadres to concentrate on studying the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and the General Line, and widely publicized the current new situation and tasks among employees. It turned the abstract into the concrete, raising many practical problems to the level of the General Line for analysis and resolution, further enhancing the awareness of cadres and employees. Everyone analyzed that the root cause of the emergence of right-leaning conservative thought was mainly empiricism and dogmatism. The reason was that they could not see the great leadership power of the Party and the subjective initiative of the masses. When things exceeded their narrow experience and book provisions, they resisted and wavered.

This struggle further consolidated the results of the rectification ideologically, enabling many people to deeply realize that the struggle between "more, faster, better, and more economically" versus "less, slower, worse, and more costly" is constant and repeated in the process of implementing the General Line. They realized that they must constantly struggle against right-leaning conservative thought in order to adhere to putting politics in command, that advanced ideas can occupy an absolute advantage, and that various tasks can advance at high speed. They also recognized the great significance of taking steel as the key link and striving for high-speed industrial development to ensure the realization of the General Line. On this basis, the entire company revised the leap forward plan for this year for the ninth time, deciding to increase steel production by another 200,000 tons, so that the annual steel output will be doubled compared with the actual output last year.

In order to further fundamentally change the leadership style and consolidate the achievements of the rectification from the aspects of organizational structure and management system, the Chongqing Steel Company has recently earnestly implemented the system of workers participating in management and cadres participating in labor. At the same time, it systematically and thoroughly implemented major reforms of business operations and launched the third mass movement to break down old rules and regulations. It also implemented decentralization of power and expanded the power of workshops. After a large reduction in rules and regulations and reports, and with workers participating in management, the company once again streamlined one-third of its management and technical personnel, sending them down to the production workshops. Now, more than 600 cadres throughout the company take turns participating in production and basic construction work every day. Many cadres and engineering technicians have signed master-apprentice contracts with veteran workers, learning skills from them.

Combined with mobilizing workers to participate in production management, Chongqing Steel Company has carried out the work of rectifying the Party and Youth League organizations. It adjusted the ideological styles of grassroots leading cadres who had poor work styles and lacked the consciousness to transform themselves, so that the leadership of each unit was truly in the hands of advanced elements. For units and weak links that were not thoroughly rectified, the company's Party Committee specially organized forces to adopt the method of "small rectification," concentrating for a period of time to make up for missed lessons, supplementing whatever was lacking. For the more than 200 staff members of the supply and marketing department who were working outside, it also adopted the method of transferring them back and concentrating them in groups to specially make up for missed lessons.

Currently, Chongqing Steel Company's rectification movement has reached its concluding stage. The company's Party Committee has made specific arrangements for various tasks after the end of the rectification; and decided that all departments, offices, and workshops should establish big-character poster societies so that the good atmosphere cultivated during the rectification can be maintained. After the workers completed the last lesson of the rectification—the debate on "Whom do we serve?"—they were even more enthusiastic. Around vigorously increasing steel production, each workshop has proposed new goals. They are self-manufacturing equipment, planning to add six to eight converters in the second half of the year to increase steel production. Workers in the production workshops are responsible for the maintenance of machinery and equipment, and workers who maintain equipment are responsible for repairs, so that repair workers are freed up to manufacture machinery and equipment. They not only self-manufacture large-scale equipment to equip themselves, but also manufacture complete sets of steelmaking, rolling, and power generation equipment for the Beibei Steel Plant, which has an annual output of 300,000 tons, and other plants.

    不断击退新的右倾保守思想
    重庆钢铁公司坚持整风到底
    本报重庆电　最近两月来，重庆钢铁公司以深入贯彻总路线为中心，对新的右倾保守思想进行了坚决的斗争，因而使以钢为纲的方针得到认真贯彻，生产和基本建设等工作搞得有声有色。
    5月中旬，这个公司的整风运动开始进入第四阶段，公司党委就发动全体职工，结合检查生产，进行了整风大复查。在复查中发现整风还不彻底，主要表现是：总路线的红旗在不少方面插得不牢或没有插上，新的保守思想抬头，领导作风彻底转变不够，一些薄弱环节还存在着空白点。为了把整风进行到底，重庆钢铁公司党委一方面组织了五千人的宣传队伍，大力宣传总路线；同时，以总路线为武器，展开查措施、评措施、添措施的检查、评比运动，通过检查、评比对新的保守思想进行坚决斗争。
    这场多快好省与少慢差费两条路线、两种思想的斗争，反复了两个回合，十分尖锐。开始是一部分保守派利用计划跃进后生产上遇到的新的困难，站出来“翻案”。他们看到采用“三槽出钢”等新技术后，由于炉后工作、运输跟不上，计划暂时没有完成，便大叫“冒进”，对原来升上去的指标不认账了。公司党委发现这种情况，就及时提出“只准上马，不准下马”的口号，发动职工展开辩论，对这种畏难而退的右倾保守思想进行猛烈反击。同时，各个车间的职工采取了加强协作、增加措施等办法，解决了生产上出现的新的不平衡。炼钢赶不上轧钢是公司生产上存在的主要矛盾，于是，技术供应处、总机械师室等十几个单位签订了生产协作竞赛合同，提出二十七个主要项目，大力支援、配合炼钢车间。这样，右倾保守思想败北了。
    但是过了不到一个月，当他们看到上半年生产计划连续八次跃进，接连出现百吨炉炼出一百九十四吨到两百吨生铁等奇迹后，不少人的保守思想又以自满、松劲的形态再一次抬头了。再加上由于大区协作的建立和以钢为纲、力争工业高速度发展方针的提出，重庆作为西南地区老工业基地，今年下半年制造炼钢、轧钢等设备的任务很大，而且要求急迫。于是，有些人又大叫“担子太重了”，“太紧张了”，认为生产计划“跃进差不多了，可一而不可再”。为了击退这种右倾保守思想，重庆钢铁公司党委最近召开了干部扩大会议，集中学习“八大”二次会议文件和总路线，并在职工中广泛宣传当前新的形势和任务，以虚带实，把许多实际问题提到总路线的原则上来分析、解决，进一步提高了干部、职工的觉悟。大家分析右倾保守思想产生的根源，主要是经验主义和教条主义。原因在于看不见党的伟大领导力量和群众的主观能动作用，当事情超出自己狭隘经验和书本条文时，便发生抵触和动摇。
    这次斗争从思想上进一步巩固了整风的成果，使许多人深刻认识到在贯彻总路线过程中多快好省与少慢差费的斗争是经常的、反复的，必须不断与右倾保守思想作斗争，才能坚持政治挂帅，先进思想才能占绝对优势，各项工作才能高速前进。认识到以钢为纲、力争工业高速度发展，对保证实现总路线的重大意义。在此基础上，全公司第九次修订了今年跃进计划，决定再增产二十万吨钢，全年钢的产量将比去年实际产量增加一倍。
    为了进一步从根本上改变领导作风，从组织机构和管理制度方面巩固整风的成果，重庆钢铁公司最近认真实行了工人参加管理和干部参加劳动的制度。同时系统、彻底地实行业务大改革，第三次发动群众大破陈规陋矩。并实行权力下放，扩大了车间的权力。在规章制度、表报大量减少和工人参加管理后，公司再一次精减了三分之一的管理人员和技术人员，下放到生产车间。现在全公司每天都有六百多干部，轮流参加生产和基本建设工作。不少干部、工程技术人员与老工人签订师徒合同，拜师学艺。
    结合发动工人参加生产管理，重庆钢铁公司进行了整顿党和团组织的工作，对基层领导干部中思想作风不好、又缺乏改造自己的自觉性的人，进行了调整，使每个单位的领导权真正掌握在先进分子手中。对整风不透的单位和薄弱环节，公司党委专门组织力量采取“小整风”的办法，集中一段时间进行补课，缺什么，补什么。对供销部门流动在外边的二百多工作人员，也采取了调换回来和分片集中的办法，专门补课。
    目前重庆钢铁公司的整风运动已到结束阶段。公司党委已对整风结束后的各项工作，作了具体安排；并决定各处、室、车间都成立大字报社，使整风中养成的良好风气能继续保持下去。工人们在结束整风最后一课——“为谁服务”的辩论后，干劲更大了。围绕大力增加钢的产量，各车间都提出新的奋斗目标。他们自制设备，下半年要增加六个到八个转炉，以增加钢的产量。生产车间的工人自己担负机器设备的维护，维护设备的工人担负检修，这样检修工人就腾出来制造机器设备。他们不仅自制大型设备装备自己，同时还为年产三十万吨的北碚钢铁厂等制造炼钢、轧钢和发电的成套设备。
