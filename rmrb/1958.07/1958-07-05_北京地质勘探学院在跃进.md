    Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration Leaps Forward
    In the socialist construction of our motherland, geological work is not only a very important link, but it must also precede industrial construction. The Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration was established to meet this need and train a large number of geological cadres. This school was opened in 1952 and is now a large college with more than 600 teachers and more than 5,000 students. The school has a total of 98 laboratories of 52 types. For example, the physics, chemical analysis, hydraulics, groundwater dynamics, and geophysical prospecting laboratories all have the latest equipment. Another fully equipped exhibition hall has exhibition rooms for earth history, paleontology, minerals, rocks, and general geology. There are also core drills and mechanical practice factories. In the past five years, the school has provided the country with more than 2,600 geological cadres, which is ten times the number of geological personnel trained in the forty years before liberation.
    According to the needs of our country's production practice, the college has six departments and eight majors: general survey, exploration, petroleum, hydrology, geophysical exploration, and exploration engineering. The eight majors are: geological surveying and mineral exploration, metallic and non-metallic mineral geology and exploration, coal and oil shale mineral geology and exploration, petroleum, natural gas geology and exploration, metallic and non-metallic geophysical exploration, petroleum and natural gas geophysical exploration, exploration engineering, and hydrogeology and engineering geology. These eight majors form an organic system from geological surveying, mapping, reserve estimation to determining mining and construction.
    On the basis of the rectification movement, all teachers and students of the college have formulated a preliminary plan. The plan points out that rapidly improving the quality of the five-year students in the school is the primary task of the college in implementing the general line. All sophomores, juniors, and seniors will participate in production practice this year, for which they have contracted the task of geological surveying and mineral exploration in an area of 400,000 square kilometers. Through these measures, we will improve the quality of teaching and strive to make the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration an advanced college in science and teaching within five years.

    北京地质勘探学院在跃进
    在祖国的社会主义建设中，地质工作不但是十分重要的一环，而且它必须走在工业建设的最前面。北京地质勘探学院就是适应这种需要，为培养大批的地质干部而建立的。这个学校是1952年开办的，现在已经是一个拥有六百多名教师，五千多名学生的一个大型学院了。全校共有包括五十二个种类的九十八个实验室。例如物理、化学分析、水力学、地下水动力学、物理探矿等实验室都有最新的设备。另一个规模齐全的陈列馆，设有地史、古生物、矿物、岩石、普通地质等展览室。还有岩心钻机和机械实习工厂。五年来，这个学校已经为国家输送了二千六百多名地质干部，相当于解放前四十年所培养的地质人员的十倍。
    根据我国生产实际的需要，这个学院共设有普查、勘探、石油、水文、物理勘探、探矿工程六个系和八个专业，这八个专业是：地质测量及找矿、金属及非金属矿产地质及勘探、煤及油页岩矿产地质及勘探、石油、天然气地质及勘探、金属和非金属地球物理勘探、石油和天然气地球物理勘探、探矿工程、水文地质及工程地质。这八个专业从地质测量、填图、储量估计到确定开采、建矿等组成了一个有机体系。
    这个学院的全体师生在整风运动的基础上，已经制订了一个初步规划。规划中指出：迅速地提高在校五年制学生的质量，是学院贯彻执行总路线的首要任务。全院二、三、四年级学生今年都要参加生产实习，为此他们已包下国家四十万平方公里面积的地质测量及找矿的任务。通过这些措施，提高教学质量，争取在五年内使北京地质勘探学院成为科学、教学先进的学院。
