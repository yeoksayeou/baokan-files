    Farmer's Swimming Pool

    (Reported by this newspaper) Shanghai's first farmer's swimming pool opened on July 1st.

    This farmer's swimming pool was built by the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanqiao Township, East Suburb District, Shanghai. This farmer's swimming pool was originally a long-abandoned lotus pond. After the cooperative members cleaned it up and rebuilt it, it only cost more than 20 yuan to build a medium-sized swimming pool that can accommodate 50 people.

    本报讯　上海第一所农民游泳池在7月1日开放。
    这所农民游泳池是上海东郊区严桥乡新民农业生产合作社修建的。这所农民游泳池原是一个荒废已久的荷花池，经过社员们加以整理和改建，只花费二十多元钱，修成了一个可以容纳五十人的中型游泳池。
