Schools across our country have begun to enter a new stage of work-study programs, characterized by a surge of factories and workshops being established in schools of all levels and types. Not only are industrial colleges and secondary vocational schools setting up factories, but comprehensive universities are also setting up factories, and even ordinary middle schools are starting small-scale iron and steel mills, artificial fiber factories, and so on. In these factories, the production labor of teachers and students generally progresses from small to large, from simple to complex, producing a large number of various products needed for industrial and agricultural production and people's daily lives. At the same time, through production practice, teachers and students acquire rich perceptual knowledge, greatly improving the quality of education, beginning to change and are changing the thoughts and feelings of intellectuals, establishing a noble communist style of daring to think and daring to act. Many teachers and students in institutions of higher learning are boldly researching and trying to manufacture important products that have not been solved at home and abroad, some even reaching or exceeding international levels. These are the crystallizations of the combination of education and labor.

Schools running factories have opened up a new path for work-study programs in full-time schools and are a good way to combine education and labor. Work-study programs have explored some avenues in the past six months or so. However, how full-time schools, especially urban schools, should carry out work-study programs still lacks a set of methods. School-run factories have many benefits for the development of work-study programs in full-time schools. It provides students with a fixed place to participate in productive labor, and the school can actively and properly arrange teaching, labor, and rest time. At the same time, this also allows productive labor to be more closely linked to what students are learning. The main purpose of work-study programs and participation in labor is to train and transform students' thinking, exercise students' physical strength, and enable students to learn production technology, becoming socialist builders who are both literate and martial, possessing both cultural and scientific knowledge and being able to work.

These factories are mostly built by teachers and students using existing equipment or waste materials. The establishment of these factories, in addition to improving the quality of education for students, also creates a portion of material wealth for the country. According to estimates from only 284 industrial secondary vocational schools across the country, the wealth that can be created for the country this year is valued at 150 million yuan. Adding the factories newly established by institutions of higher learning and recently by secondary vocational schools and ordinary middle schools, the wealth created for the country will be even more considerable.

The combination of education and labor is the fundamental difference between the socialist and capitalist education policies. Since the beginning of work-study programs, they have encountered tangible or intangible resistance from people with bourgeois educational ideas. Recently, with many schools running factories, some people are again clamoring that it "disrupts the educational order of the school" and makes things "chaotic." We want to ask, what kind of teaching order is good? Is it the bourgeois teaching order or the socialist teaching order? Bourgeois education is divorced from productive labor, separating mental and physical labor, and educating people to despise physical labor and physical laborers. We have been breaking this teaching order in the past, and we must break it even more thoroughly in the future. Without destruction, there can be no construction. Without breaking the old capitalist teaching order, we cannot establish a new socialist teaching order. This is one of the main contents of the educational revolution. Facts have proven that once education and labor are combined, it is very good. Therefore, schools of all levels and types must do everything possible to create new forms of combining education and labor, and resolutely and continuously carry out reforms in this area. We should strive to create a complete socialist teaching system and never listen to the cries of people with bourgeois educational ideas.

    学校也要大办工业
    萧敏
    我国学校的勤工俭学已经开始进入了一个新的阶段，其特点就是各级各类学校风起云涌地办工厂、车间，不仅工科高等学校和中等专业学校办起了工厂，综合性大学办起了工厂，而且普通中学也纷纷办起小型的炼铁、炼钢厂、人造纤维厂等。在这些工厂里，师生们的生产劳动一般由小到大，由简单到复杂，生产出大批为工、农业生产和人民日常生活中所需要的各种产品，同时，通过生产实践，师生们获得丰富的感性知识，大大提高了教育质量，开始改变和正在改变着知识分子的思想感情，树立敢想、敢干的高尚的共产主义风格，不少高等学校的师生大胆地研究试制中外所没有解决的重要产品，有的甚至达到或超过国际水平。这些，正是教育和劳动相结合的结晶。
    学校办工厂，为全日制学校的勤工俭学打开了一条新的道路，是教育和劳动结合的好办法。勤工俭学在半年多以来，已经摸索到一些门路。但是，全日制的学校尤其是城市的学校究竟应当怎样搞，也还没有一套办法。而学校办工厂，对于全日制学校勤工俭学的开展有很多好处，它使学生参加生产劳动有了固定的地方，学校可以主动地妥善地安排教学、劳动和休息时间，同时，这样也可以使生产劳动与学生所学的东西比较紧密地连系起来。勤工俭学、参加劳动的主要目的，是锻炼和改造学生的思想，锻炼学生的体力，并使学生学会生产技术，成为能文能武，既有文化科学知识，又会劳动的社会主义建设者。
    这些工厂大都是利用原有设备或利用废料，以师生的双手办起来的。这些工厂的建立，除了对学生提高教育质量外，还为国家创造了一部分物质财富。仅据全国二百八十四个工业性质的中等专业学校的估算，今年可以为国家创造的财富价值一亿五千万元，加上高等学校以及最近中等专业学校、普通中学新办的工厂，为国家所创造的财富将更加可观。
    教育和劳动的结合是社会主义教育方针和资本主义教育方针的根本区别。从勤工俭学开始以来，就遇到具有资产阶级教育思想的人们有形或无形的抵制。近来，许多学校兴办工厂，有些人又在吵吵嚷嚷，说“打乱了学校的教育秩序”。搞的“乱糟糟”。我们要问，什么样的教学秩序才是好的呢？是资产阶级的教学秩序，还是社会主义的教学秩序。资产阶级教育脱离生产劳动，把劳心和劳力分离，教育人们鄙视体力劳动，鄙视体力劳动者。这种教学秩序，我们过去已经在破，今后还要大破特破。不破不立，不破除旧的资本主义教学秩序，就不能立新的社会主义的教学秩序。这是教育革命的主要内容之一。事实已经证明，教育和劳动一经结合，就好得很。因此，各级各类学校要千方百计地创造教育和劳动结合的新形式，坚决地不断地进行这方面的改革。我们应当努力创造出一套完整的社会主义的教学制度，绝不要听信具有资产阶级教育思想的人们的叫嚷。
