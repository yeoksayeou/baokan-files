    A Foreign Journalist's View of the Anti-Aggression Demonstration of the People of Beijing
    [This is an abstract of a report published in the Paris "Express" on July 24, written by Claude Lanzmann, a journalist from the newspaper who was visiting China.]
    The scene viewed from the famous Tiananmen Gate is truly breathtaking. On the wide avenue separating the inner and outer cities, between Tiananmen and Qianmen, the crowd stretches as far as the eye can see. Five hundred thousand Beijingers, countless black heads and raised fists, enthusiastically cheer for Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen and the representatives of the United Arab Republic surrounding him. Thousands of banners and flags of various sizes, with red characters on a white background, red characters on a yellow background, blue characters on a red background, and white and green slogans, flutter high above the crowd, all condemning American interference. And whenever Peng Zhen stops speaking and allows the Arabic translator to speak, five hundred thousand arms raise small triangular flags with light green and pink characters.
    The demonstration speeches concluded within two hours. Beneath Tiananmen Gate, worker and student delegations held brief and emotionally charged impromptu open-air performances before it was their turn to leave the square, the content of which was about the American landing. I watched one of these performances: leading the way was the Grim Reaper (a tall and thin Chinese man, draped in a coat, his body and face made up to resemble an anatomical skeleton), followed by the Arab people in chains, surrounded by the audience. Those symbolizing the Arab people were two women in Gypsy costumes and two men in tattered clothes, dark-skinned, with drawn-on sideburns. Their arms were bound with heavy chains. Behind them were an American in uniform, wearing dark glasses, with a weak expression, and an Arab tyrant with a turban and a whip. With the sound of gongs and drums, the tyrant with the whip pretended to be both hateful and fearful, raising his whip to strike the people. The people did not flinch, knocking the tyrant to the ground twice with their shoulders. Then the American ordered the tyrant to get up and fight. The tyrant, showing a hideous face, desperately knocked a chained man to the ground. At this moment, cymbals sounded loudly: the people immediately broke free from their chains and picked up rifles – real rifles, passed from the audience.
    At this point, the tyrant and the American turned pale with fright and lay on the ground begging for mercy. The people walked towards them angrily and resolutely. The American let out a hoarse howl. Then two Chinese men with fake noses and wearing navy caps walked through the crowd, pushing a cardboard bow of an American ship. The people retreated around the square twice. Then one of the actors playing an Arab shouted in Chinese:
    "Americans get out of Lebanon, get out of Korea, get out of Taiwan, get out of the Philippines, get out of Japan!"
    The entire audience raised their fists and shouted slogans in unison. The Arab people advanced together, and those "Marines" turned around and fled shamefully.
    Late into the night, Beijing was still in a state of frenzy. The city would not calm down until dawn, and another demonstration was held yesterday afternoon at four o'clock. I hardly slept all night. Tens of thousands of Beijingers walked along the brightly lit streets all night long. They were all organized into delegations according to their professions, enterprises, and districts, and all headed towards the British Chargé d'Affaires' office, two hundred meters from Tiananmen Gate. It is now 5:00 PM on July 19th in Beijing. This movement has lasted exactly twenty-five hours, and it is expected to continue throughout the night. It is estimated that two million people participated in this demonstration. In other words, two-thirds of Beijing's population will loudly express their indignation to the Chargé d'Affaires and his secretaries.
    I had just passed the British residence after talking with Mr. Chen Yi, and two tired-looking but still indifferent secretaries stood behind the iron fence of the garden, while Tibetans, Miaos, Uyghurs, and Mongolians from the Nationalities Institute surged straight towards them. Here, there were also huge paintings depicting the ugly deeds of Britain and the United States. One painting depicted an imperialist jackal wearing a US military police hat, with its tongue hanging out and spewing blood, stabbing a white-turbaned Arab giant with a bayonet. Another painting depicted an imperialist jackal piercing through a paper circle, thereby showing that it is just a "paper tiger," as Chairman Mao said.

### 一个外国记者眼里的北京人民反侵略示威

    一个外国记者眼里的
    北京人民反侵略示威
    〔这是登在7月24日巴黎“快报”上的报道的摘要，作者是该报访问中国的记者克洛德·郎兹曼。〕
    从著名的天安门上观看，景象真是令人惊心动魄的。在天安门和前门之间，把内城和外城分开的宽阔大街上从这一头到那一头一望无际尽是人群。五十万北京人，数不尽的黑色头颅和高举着的拳头，狂热地向北京市长彭真以及围绕着他的阿拉伯联合共和国代表们欢呼。成千上万个大小不同的红底白字、红底黄字、蓝底红字、还有白色和绿色的标语和旗帜在人群之上，高高迎风飘扬，标语都谴责美国的干涉。而每当彭真停止讲话，让阿拉伯翻译发言时，五十万只手臂就此起彼伏举起淡绿色和粉红色的写着字的三角形小旗。
    示威的讲演部分在两小时内结束。在天安门下面，工人和学生代表团，在轮到他们离开广场之前，举行简短和情绪激昂的当场露天演出，内容是关于美国的登陆。我看了这些演出中的一个：走在前面的是死神（一个又高又瘦的中国人，肩膀上披上外套，身体和面部化装成类似解剖骷髅模型），走在后面的是戴上锁链的阿拉伯人民，围着他们的是观众。象征阿拉伯人民的是两个穿着吉卜赛服装的妇女和两个衣服破烂、肤色黝黑、画上胳腮胡的男人。他们的胳臂戴上沉重的锁链。走在他们后面的是一个穿着制服、戴黑眼镜、嘴部表情软弱的美国人和一个缠着头巾、手执鞭子的阿拉伯暴君。锣鼓声一响，手执皮鞭的暴君装做又恨又怕的样子，举起鞭子走向人民。人民毫不退缩，两次用肩膀把暴君撞倒在地。于是美国人命令暴君爬起来动手打。显出一付狰狞面目的暴君，拼命把一个戴上锁链的男人打倒在地。这时铙钹声大作：人民一下就挣脱了身上的锁链、拿起步枪——这是真的步枪，从观众中递过去的。
    这时暴君和美国人脸色吓得发白，伏在地上请求饶恕。人民愤怒而坚决的向他们走过来。美国人发出嘶哑的嚎叫声。接着两个装上假鼻子的戴海军帽的中国人穿过人群，他们推着用硬纸板做的美国船只的船首。人民绕场后退两周。于是扮演两个阿拉伯人的其中的一个用中国话高呼：
    “美国人从黎巴嫩滚出去，从朝鲜滚出去，从台湾滚出去，从菲律宾滚出去，从日本滚出去”。
    全体观众们高举拳头一致高呼口号。阿拉伯人民一齐向前挺进，那些“海军陆战队”就转过身去可耻地拼命逃跑了。
    到了深夜时分，北京还处在狂热之中。这座城市到黎明时才能平静下来，而昨天午后四点又举行示威了。我差不多通宵未睡。成千上万的北京人整夜在灯光辉煌的大街上川流不息地走过。他们大家按照职业、企业和市区而组成代表团，都走向距天安门两百公尺的英国代办处。现在在北京是7月19号午后五点钟。这个运动已经恰好历时二十五小时之久，而人们预计它将通宵继续下去。参加这次示威的人估计有二百万。换句话说，北京人口的三分之二将向代办和他的秘书们高声表示他们的愤慨。
    我同陈毅先生谈话后刚刚经过英国人的别墅，两个面带倦容，但是仍然无动于衷的秘书站在花园的铁栏后面，而民族学院的西藏人、苗人、维吾尔人和蒙古人直向他们涌去。在这里还有描绘英美丑事的巨幅图画。一幅图画描绘带着美国大兵军事警察帽、垂着舌头的口喷鲜血的帝国主义野心狼插在一个戴白色头巾的阿拉伯巨人的刺刀上。另一幅图画描绘穿破一个纸圈的帝国主义野心狼，从而表明它只不过是像毛主席所说的那样是一只“纸老虎”。
