Collaboration is Strength

Under the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, the volume of freight transport across the country has increased unprecedentedly this year. On the railway side, the number of wagons loaded in the first quarter of this year increased by 20% compared with the same period last year, and the second quarter increased by 33% compared with the first quarter. It is estimated that the fourth quarter will increase by about 50% compared with the first quarter. Some railway lines are now experiencing a situation where a large amount of materials cannot be transported in time. 300,000 tons of coal from Yangquan, Shanxi, cannot be shipped out in time. In terms of highways and shipping, transportation capacity is also unable to meet the growing needs.

The transportation process is a continuation of the production process in the circulation sphere and a link in the entire national economy. If transportation lags behind the needs of production, it will inevitably create difficulties for the development of production. To quickly resolve the contradiction between transportation capacity and transportation volume and ensure the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction centered on industry and agriculture is a very urgent task for the transportation sector.

How to resolve the contradiction between transportation capacity and transportation volume? Going all out, aiming high, and building new railways, highways, waterways, and airlines more, faster, better, and more economically, and adding more transportation equipment and vehicles, is one way; extensively carrying out technological revolution in the transportation sector to improve transportation efficiency is another way; strengthening transportation collaboration and leveraging the potential of existing transportation equipment is also a way. The Communications Work Department of the CPC Central Committee recently held a symposium on transportation collaboration, introducing many experiences in this area, proving that strengthening transportation collaboration has great practical significance for alleviating the current contradiction between transportation capacity and transportation volume.

Collaboration between departments, regions, and enterprises is one of the basic characteristics of socialist production relations. If the collaborative relationship is not handled well, it will inevitably hinder the development of productive forces. This is especially true for transportation collaboration. The transportation process always involves the relationship between the transportation department and the material consignment department, or between several transportation departments. If transportation collaboration is done well, the time for cargo handover, loading, and unloading can be shortened, the turnover of transportation vehicles can be accelerated, and the utilization efficiency of transportation vehicles can be improved. Thus, a large amount of transportation capacity can be increased without increasing or only slightly increasing some new equipment. This has been proven by the experience of Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Tianjin, and many other regions. Collaboration is strength. Where transportation collaboration is strengthened, transportation capacity is increased. In Leshan Prefecture, Sichuan, after the Great Leap Forward in production, a large amount of materials were frequently stockpiled. After the Leshan Prefectural Party Committee organized various transportation departments and consigning units to carry out a collaborative competition, the utilization rate of transportation vehicles increased to 95%, basically solving the phenomenon of material stockpiling. In the past, various transportation vehicles in Tianjin could only transport 50,000 tons of goods per day. After organizing transportation collaboration, this has now increased to nearly 80,000 tons of goods per day.

The issue of organizing transportation collaboration has attracted the attention of many places, and there are many good experiences. Especially after the rectification movement, people's communist ideology has been greatly promoted, and transportation collaboration has become more in-depth. Some long-standing problems have been resolved; the relationships between some units with long-term poor collaboration have been improved. Many transportation departments have further clarified the idea of serving production, revised unreasonable rules and regulations, simplified material consignment procedures, and reduced many troubles for the consigning departments; many material consigning departments have also provided many conveniences to the transportation departments, enabling the transportation departments to organize transportation in a planned way. All of these have enabled existing transportation equipment to exert greater power and carry more goods. However, this does not mean that there are no problems in transportation collaboration. On a national scale, transportation collaboration has not yet received widespread attention, and the idea of departmentalism is still rampant. Some transportation departments often only seek their own convenience, without considering the needs of production, only calculating small local accounts, and not the big national accounts. There are also phenomena of mutual distrust, lack of consideration, and lack of cooperation between transportation departments. Certain production departments, commercial departments, and other material consigning departments also often emphasize special circumstances and have not seriously solved the problems of accuracy and timeliness of transportation plans, which has increased difficulties for the transportation departments. The transportation work departments of some local party committees, especially the party committees of some enterprises, have not regularly grasped the political and ideological work in transportation collaboration. In the organizational work of transportation collaboration, some regions have not yet established organizations for transportation collaboration, and some regions have not yet organized the planned coordination between transportation departments. This situation has created a contradictory phenomenon: on the one hand, there is insufficient transportation capacity, and a large amount of materials are stockpiled; on the other hand, due to poor transportation collaboration, a large amount of transportation capacity is wasted. If transportation collaboration work is strengthened, this part of transportation capacity can certainly be organized and brought into play. Even those regions that have done a lot of work in transportation collaboration and have some experience, due to the leap forward in production and construction, and due to the decentralization of a large number of central transportation enterprises, transportation collaboration also needs to be further improved in order to play a greater role.

Transportation collaboration is an organizational work that involves a wide range. In addition to the need for collaboration between transportation departments and consigning departments, as well as within the operational departments, railways, shipping, highways, civil aviation, etc., and various provinces and regions should also organize close collaboration and cooperation. The general principle of transportation collaboration should be to always maintain smooth transportation, improve transportation efficiency, ensure industrial and agricultural production, and ensure the needs of people's lives. Under the general principle, the principle of collaboration between transportation departments and consigning departments should be: serving production and saving transportation capacity. The primary task of the transportation department is to regularly provide large, high-quality, low-cost, safe, and rapid transportation capacity to ensure the exchange between urban and rural areas and the needs of continuous industrial and agricultural production. The consigning department should also pay close attention to saving transportation capacity. The principle of transportation collaboration between regions should be: mutual support and common development. The transportation lines in many regions are intertwined, and it is necessary to support each other in organizing sources of goods, organize round-trip transportation in a planned way, and minimize one-way transportation in order to save the country's transportation capacity. The principle of collaboration between various transportation departments should be: mutual cooperation and common improvement.

According to existing experience, organizing transportation collaboration should mainly focus on the following links: First, balance and connect the consignment plans of the material departments and the transportation plans of the transportation departments, as well as the transportation plans between the various transportation departments, and carry out transportation in a coordinated manner. Second, organize balanced transportation, give full play to the effectiveness of transportation equipment in the off-season, and avoid transportation congestion and material stockpiling during busy transportation periods. Third, unify the control of cargo sources, allocate transportation capacity in a planned way, comprehensively utilize transportation vehicles (including transportation vehicles of government agencies), and give full play to the effectiveness of various transportation vehicles. Fourth, organize the collaborative cooperation of transportation operations such as loading and unloading and cargo handover between various enterprises. Fifth, organize joint labor among various departments. Sixth, organize joint transportation of various transportation vehicles. Such as combined water and land transportation between railways and shipping, combined transportation of railways, highways, aviation, and water transportation, etc.

To strengthen transportation collaboration, it is necessary to put politics in command, start with solving ideological problems, break departmentalism, and establish socialist thinking. Only when the ideological problems of the vast number of employees, especially the leading cadres of enterprises, are solved can other specific problems be solved easily. At the same time, we must follow the mass line. Doing a good job in transportation collaboration and improving transportation efficiency is an urgent requirement of the vast number of employees. They are directly engaged in transportation work, have a deep understanding of the harm of departmentalism, and can also come up with many good ways to collaborate; all collaborative measures must ultimately be realized through them. Only by mobilizing the masses can we truly do a good job in collaboration. Local party committees must lead the work of transportation collaboration. Because transportation collaboration involves many departments, only the unified leadership of the party committee can unify everyone's understanding from a political and ideological perspective, correctly implement transportation collaboration, and strengthen the huge power of transportation to adapt to the increasing needs of industry and agriculture under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the country.

    协作就是力量
    在工农业大跃进的新形势下，今年全国的货物运输量空前增长。铁路方面，今年第一季度的装车数比去年同期增长了20％，第二季度又比第一季度增长了33％，据估计第四季度将比第一季度增长50％左右。某些铁路线现在已经出现了大量物资不能及时运输的现象，山西的阳泉煤已有三十万吨不能及时运出来。公路和航运方面，运输力量也同样不能满足日益增长的需要。
    运输过程是生产过程在流通范围中的继续，是整个国民经济联系的纽带。运输落后于生产的需要，就必然给生产的发展造成困难。迅速解决运输能力和运输量不相适应的矛盾，保证以工农业为中心的社会主义建设事业的大跃进，是运输部门当前一项十分紧迫的任务。
    怎样解决运输能力和运输量不相适应的矛盾呢？鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设新的铁路、公路、航道和航空线，增加更多的运输设备和运输工具，是一个办法；在交通运输部门广泛开展技术革命，提高运输效率，又是一个办法；加强运输协作，发挥现有运输设备的潜在力量，也是一个办法。中共中央交通工作部最近召开了运输协作问题座谈会，介绍了许多这方面的经验，证明了加强运输协作，对于缓和当前运输能力和运输量之间不相适应的矛盾，有着巨大的现实意义。
    部门和部门之间、地区和地区之间、企业和企业之间的协作，是社会主义生产关系的基本特征之一。协作关系处理得不好，必然阻碍生产力的发展。运输方面的协作更是这样。运输过程总要涉及运输部门和物资托运部门，或几个运输部门之间的关系。如果运输协作搞得好，就可以缩短货物的交接、装卸等的时间，加速运输工具的周转，提高运输工具的使用效率，从而可以在不增加或者少量增加一些新设备的条件下，增加很大的运输能力。这已经被四川、黑龙江、天津等许多地区的经验所证明。协作就是力量，那里加强了运输协作，那里就增加了运输力量。四川乐山专区，在生产大跃进以后，经常积压大批的物资，当中共乐山地委把各个运输部门和托运单位组织起来，开展协作大竞赛以后，运输工具的使用率就提高到95％，基本上解决了物资积压的现象。天津市内的各种运输工具，过去总共每天只能运五万吨货物，经过组织运输协作，现在提高到每天能运近八万吨货物。
    组织运输协作的问题，已经引起了许多地方的注意，并且有不少很好的经验。特别是经过整风运动，人们的共产主义思想大大发扬，运输协作也更加深入了。有些长期得不到解决的问题，解决了；有些长期协作关系不好的单位，关系搞好了。许多运输部门进一步明确了为生产服务的思想，修改了不合理的规章制度，简化了物资托运手续，减少了托运部门的许多麻烦；许多物资托运部门也给运输部门提供了很多便利条件，使运输部门能够有计划地组织运输。这些都使得现有的运输设备能够发挥更大的力量，承运更多的货物。但是，这并不是说目前在运输协作方面就没有问题了。就全国范围来看，运输协作还没有普遍引起足够的重视，本位主义的思想仍在兴风作浪。有些运输部门往往只图自己方便，不考虑生产的需要，只算局部的小账，不算国家的大账。运输部门之间也有互不信任、互不照顾、互不配合的现象。某些生产部门、商业部门和其他物资托运部门也往往强调特殊，没有认真解决运输计划准确性和及时性的问题，给运输部门增加了困难。有些地方党委的交通工作部门、特别是有些企业的党委，还没有经常地抓运输协作中的政治思想工作。在运输协作的组织工作上，有些地区还没有建立运输协作的组织，有些地区还没有组织运输部门之间的计划衔接。这种情况，造成了一种矛盾的现象：一方面是运输力量不足，大批物资积压；另一方面由于运输协作不好，又有大批运输力量被浪费了。如果加强运输协作工作，必然能够把这部分运输力量组织起来，发挥作用。就是那些在运输协作方面做了许多工作，有了一些经验的地区，由于生产和建设事业的跃进，由于大批中央交通企业下放，运输协作也需要进一步提高，才能发挥更大的作用。
    运输协作是一个牵涉范围很广的组织工作，除了运输部门和托运部门之间，以及运转部门内部需要协作以外，铁路、航运、公路、民用航空等部门、各个省、各个地区之间，也应该组织密切的协作配合。运输协作的总原则应该是经常保持运输畅通、提高运输效率、保证工农业生产、保证人民生活的需要。在总的原则下，运输部门和托运部门的协作原则应该是：服务生产，节约运力。运输部门的首要任务是要经常提供量大、质好、价廉、安全、迅速的运力，保证城乡交流和工农业连续生产的需要。托运部门也应当十分注意节约使用运力。地区之间运输协作的原则应该是：互相支援，共同发展。许多地区的运输线路是相互交叉的，需要在组织货源上互相支援，有计划地组织往返运输，尽量减少单程运输，以节省国家的运力。各个运输部门之间的协作原则应该是：互相配合，共同提高。
    根据现有经验来看，组织运输协作，主要应该抓紧以下几个环节：第一、使物资部门的托运计划和运输部门的运输计划，以及各个运输部门之间的运输计划互相平衡、互相衔接，协调地进行运输。第二、组织平衡运输，在淡季充分发挥运输设备的效力，在运输繁忙时避免运输堵塞和物资积压。第三、统一掌握货源，有计划地分配运力，综合利用运输工具（包括机关运输工具），充分发挥各种运输工具的效能。第四、组织各企业间装卸、货物交接等运输作业的协作配合。第五、组织各个部门的联合劳动。第六、组织各种运输工具的联合运输。如铁路和航运之间的水陆联运，铁路、公路、航空、水运的联运等。
    加强运输协作，必须政治挂帅，从解决思想问题入手，破本位主义思想，立社会主义思想。只有广大职工、特别是企业领导干部的思想问题解决了，其他具体问题才能迎刃而解。同时必须走群众路线。搞好运输协作，提高运输效率，是广大职工的迫切要求。他们直接从事运输工作，对本位主义的危害体会很深，也能想出许多协作的好办法；一切协作措施，最后也都要通过他们去实现。只有把群众动员起来，才能真正搞好协作。各地党委必须来领导运输协作工作。因为运输协作牵涉到很多部门，只有党委统一领导，从政治思想上统一大家的认识，才能正确地实行运输协作，加强运输的巨大力量，以适应全国工农业在大跃进的形势下日益增长的需要。
