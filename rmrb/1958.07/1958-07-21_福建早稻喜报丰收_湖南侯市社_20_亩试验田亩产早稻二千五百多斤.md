Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 20th. More than 8,740,000 mu of early rice in Fujian Province have fully entered the busy harvest season. As of the 15th, the more than 2,660,000 mu that have been harvested generally yielded 40% to 100% more than last year. In the Jinjiang Special District, which originally had higher yields, the more than 650,000 mu of early rice harvested earlier had an average yield of 601 jin per mu, an increase of 70% over last year. In the northern Fujian and western Fujian mountainous areas such as Nanping and Longyan, which originally had lower yields, the 7,845 mu of early rice harvested earlier had an average yield of 495 jin to 500 jin per mu, an increase of 74.2% to 105% respectively over last year.

Amidst the news of an unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice in various places, records of high yields are constantly emerging. According to incomplete statistics from Longxi, Jinjiang, Nanping, Longyan, Minhou, and the suburbs of Fuzhou, there are more than 40,636 mu of high-yield fields with early rice yields of 1,000 jin to 2,000 jin per mu, more than 86.9 mu with yields of 2,000 jin to 3,000 jin per mu, and 7.375 mu with yields of more than 3,000 jin of dry grain per mu, of which 2.06 mu harvested more than 5,806 jin of dry grain. The yield of these high-yield fields in one season has increased by one to five times compared to the total yield of last year.

Encouraged by the victorious situation of the unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice, a high tide of striving for a greater bumper harvest of late rice has been formed in rural areas across the province. As of the 15th, the province had accumulated more than 29 billion dan of various summer planting fertilizers, deeply plowed more than 720,000 mu of rice fields as they were harvested, and transplanted 122,000 mu of continuous cropping late rice seedlings ahead of schedule. The density of planting generally reached 50,000 to 100,000 clusters per mu, an increase of one to three times the number of early rice seedlings planted.

Yan Baoyuan, deputy director of the Houshi Commune in You County, Hunan Province, and team cadres Yan Yonglan and Yan Renguang, etc., planted 20.62 mu of early rice experimental fields, which yielded a total of 53,122 jin and four liang of dry grain, an average yield of 2,576 jin and four liang per mu.

    福建早稻喜报丰收
    湖南侯市社20亩试验田亩产早稻二千五百多斤
    据新华社福州20日电  福建省八百七十四万多亩早稻已经全面进入收割大忙阶段，到15日止，已经收割的二百六十六万多亩一般都比去年增产四成到一倍以上。原来产量较高的晋江专区较早收割的六十五万多亩早稻，平均亩产六百零一斤，比去年增产七成；原来产量较低的南平、龙岩等闽北和闽西山区，较早收割的七千八百四十五亩早稻，平均亩产量也达四百九十五斤到五百斤，分别比去年增产74.2％—105％。
    在各地早稻全面大丰收声中，高额丰产纪录也正一个接一个地不断出现。据龙溪、晋江、南平、龙岩、闽侯和福州市郊等地不完全统计，早稻亩产一千斤以上到两千斤的高额丰产田共达四万零六百三十六亩多，亩产两千斤到三千斤的达八十六亩九分多，亩产干谷三千斤以上的有七点三七五亩，其中有二亩零六厘收获干谷五千八百零六斤多。这些高额丰产田一季的产量都比去年全年产量跃增一倍到五倍以上。
    在早稻空前丰收的胜利形势鼓舞下，争取晚稻更大丰收的高潮已在各地农村中形成。到15日止，全省所积各种夏种肥料共达二百九十亿多担，并已随割随深耕稻田七十二万多亩，提前插下连作晚稻秧十二万二千多亩，密植程度一般每亩达到五万丛到十万丛，比早稻插秧丛数增加一倍到三倍。
    据新华社长沙20日电  湖南省攸县侯市社副社长颜保元和队干部颜永兰、颜仁光等种的二十点六二亩早稻试验田，共收干谷五万三千一百二十二斤四两，平均亩产二千五百七十六斤四两。以中共县委第一书记阎明润为首的验收组，曾进行了详细验收。
