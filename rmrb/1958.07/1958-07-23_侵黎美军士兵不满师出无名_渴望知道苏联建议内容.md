Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: According to Western news agencies from Beirut, U.S. invading soldiers in Beirut are eager to know the contents of Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's letters suggesting the convening of a summit meeting.

The news about Khrushchev sending these letters spread among the U.S. invading soldiers through radio broadcasts and word of mouth. However, the U.S. military authorities do not allow them to know the details of the letters, so they are asking about them "with a cautious attitude." Many U.S. soldiers, unwilling to disclose their names, hope to find "some way" to get rid of the awkward situation of undertaking a dirty mission of aggression.

Some U.S. invading soldiers expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of justification for the deployment. A U.S. sergeant who had participated in World War II and the Korean War asked, "How long do they plan to keep us stationed here?"

    侵黎美军士兵不满师出无名
    渴望知道苏联建议内容
    据新华社22日讯  据西方通讯社从贝鲁特发出的消息说，在贝鲁特的美国侵略军士兵渴望知道苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫关于建议召开首脑会议的信件的内容。
    关于赫鲁晓夫发出这些信件的消息是通过电台广播和口头在美国侵略军士兵当中传开的。但是美军当局不让他们知道信件的细节，他们就“抱着小心的态度”来打听。许多不愿意公开自己的姓名的美国兵都希望找到“某种办法”来摆脱他们担负肮脏的侵略任务的尴尬处境。
    一些美国侵略军士兵对师出无名的情况表示不满，一个曾经参加第二次大战和侵朝战争的美国中士问道，“他们打算让我们在这里驻多久？”
