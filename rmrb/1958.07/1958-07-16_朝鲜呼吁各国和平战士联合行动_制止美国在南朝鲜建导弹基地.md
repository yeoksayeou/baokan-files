    North Korea Calls on Peace Fighters of All Countries to Unite
    Stop the United States from Building Missile Bases in South Korea
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 15th: According to Pyongyang newspapers today, the Korean National Peace Committee held an enlarged meeting on the 14th. The meeting decided to issue an appeal to peace organizations and peace fighters around the world, calling on them to join the Korean people in stopping the warmongering act of the American United States in building missile bases in South Korea.
    The appeal pointed out that due to the warmongering behavior of the American United States, the peace that peace-loving people around the world yearn for is suffering a serious threat. The appeal stated that the warmongering American United States grossly violates the Korean Armistice Agreement, transports various new types of weapons into South Korea, reorganizes the U.S. military forces stationed in South Korea into atomic divisions, and, in particular, recently established the U.S. military "Fourth Missile Command" in South Korea, and is frantically building missile bases. This is a blatant challenge to peace in Korea and around the world, and a serious threat to the lives of millions of people.
    The appeal emphasized that turning South Korea into a missile base is part of the warmongering American United States' entire atomic war plan. The U.S. military's occupation of South Korea is the biggest obstacle to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the root cause of all the misfortunes of the South Korean people, and a major factor in the tension in the Far East. The appeal expressed its belief that peace-loving people in all countries will use all possible means and methods to support the Korean people and fight to eliminate the threat of atomic war in the Far East.
    At the enlarged meeting held on the 14th, Bai Nanyun, Standing Committee member of the Korean National Peace Committee and President of the Academy of Sciences, made a report. Jiang Xiemo, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Professional General Union, and Xu Wanyi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Writers' Union, spoke at the meeting. They unanimously condemned the crime of the warmongering American United States in building missile bases in South Korea.

    朝鲜呼吁各国和平战士联合行动
    制止美国在南朝鲜建导弹基地
    新华社平壤15日电　据平壤报纸今天报道，朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会在14日举行了扩大会议，会议决定向全世界和平团体和和平战士发出呼吁书，呼吁他们同朝鲜人民一起来制止美国好战分子在南朝鲜建立导弹基地的玩火行为。
    呼吁书指出，由于美国好战分子的这种玩火行为，全世界爱好和平人民所热望的和平正在遭受着严重的威胁。呼吁书说，美国好战分子粗暴地违反朝鲜停战协定，向南朝鲜运入各种新型武器，把驻在南朝鲜的美军部队改编为原子师，特别是在最近又在南朝鲜成立了美军“第四导弹司令部”，并且疯狂地在建立导弹基地。这是对朝鲜和全世界和平的露骨的挑战，也是对千百万人民的生命的严重威胁。
    呼吁书强调说，把南朝鲜变成导弹基地是美国好战分子整个原子战争计划的一环，美军对南朝鲜的强占是朝鲜问题和平解决的最大障碍，是南朝鲜人民一切不幸的根源，是远东紧张局势的主要因素。呼吁书表示相信，一切国家的和平人士将用一切可能的手段和方法来支援朝鲜人民，为消除在远东发生原子战争的威胁而斗争。
    在14日举行的扩大会议上，朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会常务委员、科学院院长白南云作了报告。朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会副委员长姜卨模、作家同盟中央委员会副委员长徐万一等在会上发了言。他们一致谴责美国好战分子在南朝鲜建立导弹基地的罪行。
