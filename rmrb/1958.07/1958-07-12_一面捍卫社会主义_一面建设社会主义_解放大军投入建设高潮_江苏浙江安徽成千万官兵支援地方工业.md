Defending Socialism on One Hand, Building Socialism on the Other
Liberation Army Throws Itself into Construction Upsurge
Tens of Thousands of Officers and Soldiers from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Support Local Industry

According to the *Xinhua Daily* report: The People's Liberation Army stationed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shanghai, and other places, while completing the tense and heavy tasks of coastal and border defense, training, construction, and other tasks, is actively investing a large amount of manpower and material resources in the country's socialist industrial construction.

After studying the General Line, these troops expressed great enthusiasm for participating in the socialist construction of the motherland. Since mid-June, troops stationed in Shanghai have sent thousands of officers and soldiers every day to the construction sites of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, No. 3, and Taishan Refractory Materials Plant to participate in construction and expansion projects. According to the opinions of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the garrison in Zhejiang Province sent more than 400 cadres and soldiers who had been tested in long-term revolutionary struggles to work in a certain medium-sized steel plant. To meet the construction needs of this steel plant, a certain PLA unit also sent thousands of officers and soldiers to work intensely on the construction of a dedicated railway branch line. The Hefei garrison in Anhui also vigorously supported local basic construction projects. The Wuxi garrison also actively participated in the construction of the local steel plant from the beginning of July. In the process of participating in construction, many generals and senior cadres personally worked alongside the soldiers, full of energy, leaving a deep impression on the people.

Providing material and equipment support is also an important aspect of the support of local garrisons for industrial construction. Dozens of tons of scrap steel collected by the vast number of officers and soldiers have been allocated to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces respectively. According to the instructions from higher authorities, nineteen old tank engines will also be allocated to Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces to support the construction of old revolutionary areas with relatively backward industry and agriculture. Many repair departments in the troops have also tapped their potential to repair machines and make simple tools for local enterprises, directly supporting the construction of local enterprises. According to incomplete statistics, from January to June, the houses transferred to local governments by garrisons in various regions totaled more than 152,000 square meters, solving the problem of insufficient factory buildings for some newly established enterprises.

In order to accelerate the country's industrial construction more quickly, garrisons in various regions are now actively planning to allocate more manpower and material resources to participate in the country's industrial construction in the future, provided that it does not excessively affect training and construction.

Furthermore, the PLA troops stationed in Nanjing are actively preparing for and carrying out industrial production.

A certain automobile repair and assembly plant successfully trial-produced a 7-horsepower single-cylinder diesel engine on June 16 in order to support the great leap forward in agricultural production. It has now been officially put into production, and it is expected to produce 800 to 1,000 units this year. After more than a month of hard work, with the cooperation and support of fraternal factories, a certain engineering corps factory of the Nanjing troops successfully trial-produced the "Red Flag" brand 27-horsepower tractor in late June. This type of tractor can plow fields, draw water, and mill rice, with good results. They will produce 500 units this year.

Recently, small factories run by the troops to produce iron and steel have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. As of July 8, eleven units, including the Political Department of the Nanjing Troops, the Engineering Department of the Air Force, the Logistics Department of the Air Force, and the Ordnance Technical School, have successively produced iron and steel. At present, in addition to the units that have successfully smelted and are increasing equipment to continue smelting, more units are actively preparing to smelt iron and steel or run other industries, and are formulating long-term plans. The artillery of the Nanjing troops has decided that all units above the regimental level should smelt steel and iron or establish factories for cement, fire-resistant bricks, etc. The Ordnance Technical School, which has made great achievements in work-study programs, is building a small blast furnace and a steelmaking converter in addition to using indigenous methods to smelt high-quality steel for the school's own use at noon on the 7th. They plan to continue to expand equipment next year, increase steel rolling equipment, and become a small iron and steel complex with an annual output of 20,000 tons of iron and 5,000 tons of steel.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the troops in running industry, the Political Department of the Nanjing Troops convened representatives of major units stationed in Nanjing on July 4th and 7th to specifically study a series of important issues related to the participation of the troops in industrial construction.

    一面捍卫社会主义　一面建设社会主义
    解放大军投入建设高潮
    江苏浙江安徽成千万官兵支援地方工业
    据新华日报消息：驻江苏、浙江、安徽、上海等地的解放军在完成紧张繁重的海、边防守卫、训练施工等各项任务的同时，以大量的人力、物力，积极地投入国家社会主义工业建设。
    这些部队经过总路线学习，对参加祖国社会主义建设事业表现了极大的热情，驻上海部队从6月中旬起，每天有成千上万的官兵在上钢一厂、三厂和太山耐火材料厂的建筑工地上，参加修建和扩大工程。浙江省驻军根据中共浙江省委的意见，派去了四百多名经过长期革命斗争考验的干部和战士，到某中型钢铁厂工作；为适应这座钢铁厂的建设需要，驻军某部还派出了数千名官兵，紧张地投入了一条铁路专用支线的修建工程。安徽合肥驻军也大力支援当地的基本建设工程。无锡驻军，从7月初起也积极地参加了当地钢铁厂的修建工程。在参加建设过程中，许多将军和高级干部都亲自和战士们一起劳动，干劲十足，在人民群众中留下了深刻的印象。
    以物资器材支援，也是各地驻军支援工业建设的一个重要方面。部队广大官兵收集的数十吨废钢铁，已经分别拨交江苏和浙江等省；十九台旧坦克发动机，根据上级的规定，也将分别调拨给江苏、安徽、湖南、湖北等省，支援对革命有贡献的、工农业比较落后的老区的建设事业。部队中不少修理部门，也发挥了潜力，为地方修理机器，制做简单工具，直接地支援了地方企业的建设。据不完全统计，1至6月份各地驻军移交地方的房屋，达十五万二千多平方公尺，解决了部分新办企业厂房不足的困难。
    为了更快地加速国家的工业建设，现在各地驻军正在积极规划，在不过多地影响训练建设前提下，准备在今后拿出更多的人力和物力参加国家的工业建设。
    又讯　解放军驻南京部队正在积极筹备与进行工业生产。
    某汽车修配厂，为了支援农业生产大跃进，在6月16日试制成功七马力单缸柴油发动机，现在已正式投入生产，预计今年可以生产八百到一千台。南京部队工程兵某厂经过一个多月苦战，在兄弟厂的协作支援下，6月下旬试制成功了“红旗牌”二十七马力拖拉机。这种拖拉机可以耕田，可以车水、轧米，效果良好。他们将在今年生产五百台。
    “最近一个时期，部队兴办的小型工厂炼钢炼铁，如雨后春笋。截至7月8日，已有南京部队政治部、空军工程部、空军后勤部、军械技术学校等十一个单位先后炼出了钢铁。目前，除冶炼成功的单位正在增加设备继续冶炼外，更多的单位正在紧张筹备炼铁炼钢或办其他工业，制订远景规划。南京部队炮兵决定在团以上的单位中，都要炼钢、炼铁或兴办水泥、耐火砖等工厂。在勤工俭学方面有很大成就的军械技术学校，除了在7日中午用土法炼出了供学校自用的优质钢以外，正在修建小高炉和炼钢转炉。他们明年准备继续扩大设备，增加轧钢设备，成为年产二万吨铁、五千吨钢的小型钢铁联合企业。
    为了加强对部队办工业的领导，南京部队政治部在7月4日和7日两次召集驻南京各大单位代表专门研究了有关部队参加工业建设一系列重要问题。（附图片）
