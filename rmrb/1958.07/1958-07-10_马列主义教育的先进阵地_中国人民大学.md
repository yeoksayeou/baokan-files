    An Advanced Bastion of Marxist-Leninist Education – Renmin University of China

    Renmin University of China is a new type of socialist comprehensive university of social sciences. Its mission is to cultivate, quickly, effectively, and economically, a working-class theoretical force of Marxism-Leninism and cadres for socialist construction.

    This school, under the direct care of the Party Central Committee, was officially opened in September 1950. It inherits and promotes the fine traditions of revolutionary education in the old liberated areas. Its predecessor was the Shaanbei Public School, North China United University, and North China University in the liberated areas. The cadres it trains are required to have a solid communist worldview, master the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and professional knowledge, creatively solve practical problems, be able to work at both higher and lower levels, be competent in both literary and military affairs, and withstand the test of risks.

    Renmin University of China now has thirteen departments: the Department of History of the Chinese Communist Party, the Department of Basic Marxism-Leninism, the Department of Economics, the Department of Philosophy, the Department of Law, the Department of Journalism, the Department of Historical Archives, the Department of Economic Planning, the Department of Industrial Economics, the Department of Agricultural Economics, the Department of Trade Economics, the Department of Statistics, and the Department of Finance. Each department also has research classes and special classes for the rotational training of on-the-job cadres. Its current enrollment targets are: industrial workers and revolutionary cadres with socialist consciousness; enrollment in the political theory departments, in addition to the previous conditions, also requires Communist Party cadres with considerable experience in Party and mass work.

    After the rectification campaign in the past six months, Renmin University of China, under the education and encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction, has carried out a major teaching reform with revolutionary spirit, implemented the policy of education serving politics and combining education with labor, and has shown a vibrant new scene. The Mao Zedong Philosophical Works Research Association and the Mao Zedong Economic Thought Research Association have been established successively, lectures on Mao Zedong Thought have been opened, and works on the study of Mao Zedong Thought have been published. Furthermore, a new curriculum system has been established, guided by Marxist-Leninist theory, based on Mao Zedong Thought, and centered on the study of the actualities of China's revolution and socialist construction. New teaching syllabuses for all courses have been drafted. Teachers go deep into factories, rural areas, and business units for labor training and investigation and research, and prepare lessons in conjunction with reality. Teachers from the Teaching and Research Office of Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism lecture on philosophy to workers at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and farmers at the Xishan Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing. Recently, the various departments and teaching and research offices of this school have been linked with more than 100 relevant departments of the Central Government and Beijing Municipality, and dozens of people, including alternate members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Kang Sheng, Xue Muqiao, Zhang Zhiyi, Huang Songling, Luo Gengmo, and Yu Guangyuan, have been invited to lecture at the school.

    In the next five years, Renmin University of China will develop greatly with the new situation of the motherland's leap forward. The number of students studying at the school will increase to 13,000, and 28,000 cadres will be sent to the country. In addition, various forms of spare-time education such as correspondence courses and night schools will be adopted to train 600 to 800 cadres for the country on a rotational basis. Scientific research will also be vigorously developed, and 10,000 special papers on the study of practical problems will be completed. The school's five-year plan strives to achieve the goal of: "Fighting hard for five years, becoming thoroughly Red and professionally proficient, and building Renmin University of China into an advanced bastion of Marxist-Leninist education."

    马列主义教育的先进阵地——中国人民大学
    中国人民大学是一所新型的社会主义社会科学综合性的大学，它的任务是多快好省地培养工人阶级的马克思列宁主义理论队伍和社会主义建设干部。
    这所学校在党中央直接关怀下，于1950年9月正式开办。它继承并发扬了老解放区革命教育的优良传统。它的前身是解放区的陕北公学、华北联合大学、华北大学。它培养的干部，要求具有巩固的共产主义世界观，掌握马克思列宁主义基本理论和专业知识，创造性地解决实际问题，在工作中能上能下，能文能武，经得起风险的考验。
    中国人民大学现在共设有十三个系，即中共党史系、马列主义基础系、经济系、哲学系、法律系、新闻系、历史档案系、经济计划系、工业经济系、农业经济系、贸易经济系、统计系、财政系，各系还设有研究班和特别班，轮训在职干部。它现在的招生对象是：具有社会主义觉悟的产业工人、革命干部；政治理论各系招生，除了具有前面的条件外，还必须是有相当党群工作经验的共产党员干部。
    中国人民大学经过半年来的整风运动，在党的社会主义建设总路线的教育和鼓舞下，以革命精神进行教学大改革，贯彻教育为政治服务、教育与劳动相结合的方针，已经出现了一片生气勃勃的新景象。毛泽东哲学著作研究会、毛泽东经济思想研究会已先后成立，开设了毛泽东思想讲座，还出版了毛泽东思想研究的著作。并且建立了以马克思列宁主义理论为指导，以毛泽东思想为纲，以研究我国革命和社会主义建设实际为中心的新的课程体系。各门课程新的教学大纲已经编写出初稿。教师深入到工厂、农村、业务单位去劳动锻炼，调查研究，结合实际进行备课。辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义教研室的教师，给北京市第一机床厂工人、北京郊区西山农业社农民讲哲学。最近这个学校的各系和各教研室已经同中央和北京市的一百多个有关部门挂钩，聘请了中共中央政治局候补委员康生和薛暮桥、张执一、黄松龄、骆耕漠、于光远等数十人来校讲学。
    在最近五年内，中国人民大学将随着祖国跃进的新形势大大发展，在校学习人数将增加到一万三千人，为国家输送干部二万八千名。此外，并采取函授、夜校等各种业余教育形式，为国家轮训干部六百到八百人。还将大力发展科学研究，完成研究实际问题的专题论文一万篇。学校提出的五年规划奋斗目标是：“苦战五年，红透专深，把中国人民大学建设成为马克思列宁主义教育的先进阵地。”（附图片）
