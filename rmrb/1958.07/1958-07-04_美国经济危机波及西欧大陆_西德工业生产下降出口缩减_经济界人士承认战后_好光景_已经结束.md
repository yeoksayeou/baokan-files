Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: Bonn - There are increasing signs that the American economic crisis has spread to the largest industrial nation in Western Europe – West Germany.

The West German Federal Bank concluded in April that the main characteristics of the West German economy in the first quarter of this year were: the phenomenon of industrial production stagnation became more serious, export trade further declined, and many business owners were selling stocks. But the current situation has further developed. Industrial production has not only stagnated, but also declined in May, down 0.6% compared to April; down 0.4% compared to May 1957. Although the decline is not very large, it is significant that this is the first decline in West German industry since the war.

The decline in production in certain specific industrial sectors is considerable. The most obvious decline is in steel production. In the first four months of this year, West German steel production decreased by 13% compared with the same period in 1957. The average daily output of pig iron, crude steel, and steel products has been declining month by month. At present, the equipment utilization rate of the vast majority of West German steel companies can only reach about 80%; a few companies can only reach 60%.

The continuous reduction in steel production has also aggravated the sales crisis in the West German coal industry. As of late June, the total amount of unsold coal and coke in West Germany had exceeded seven million tons. In addition, major consumers have stockpiled about 11 million tons of unused coal. Therefore, it is difficult to see a turnaround in coal sales in the near future. Coal mine owners in the Ruhr area estimate that unsold stockpiled coal will exceed eight million tons in the third quarter of this year, approaching the peak of unsold stockpiled coal during the 1930-1933 economic crisis – 8.5 million tons.

In addition, consumer goods production decreased by 5.2% in May, and orders decreased by 10%. Many textile companies have been forced to reduce production and lay off large numbers of workers due to insufficient orders.

In April of this year, West Germany's exports decreased by 5% compared with the same period in 1957, and decreased by 6% in May compared with the same period last year. This downward trend has not occurred since March 1953.

At present, foreign orders in West Germany are continuing to decrease, and it is estimated that West German industrial production will further decline as a result.

Although West German Economics Minister Erhard still pretends to be calm and asserts that the West German economy will not experience a "recession," West German industrial and economic figures generally admit that the "good times" of post-war West German industrial expansion and export boom have come to an end. They are deeply worried about the further development of a series of crisis symptoms in the economy.

### 美国经济危机波及西欧大陆  西德工业生产下降出口缩减  经济界人士承认战后“好光景”已经结束

    美国经济危机波及西欧大陆
    西德工业生产下降出口缩减
    经济界人士承认战后“好光景”已经结束
    据新华社3日讯　波恩消息：目前有种种迹象表明，美国的经济危机已经波及西欧大陆上的最大工业国——西德。
    西德联邦银行4月间曾经把今年第一季度西德经济的主要特征归结为：工业生产停滞的现象更加严重、出口贸易进一步减退和许多企业主正在抛出股票。但是目前情况有了进一步的发展。工业生产已经不止是停滞，而且在5月份出现了下降，同4月份相比，下降了0.6％；同1957年5月相比，下降了0.4％。虽然下降幅度还不很大，但是具有重要意义的是：这是西德工业战后第一次下降。
    某些具体工业部门生产的下降是相当大的。下降最明显的是钢铁生产。今年头四个月西德钢产量比1957年同期减少了13％。生铁、原钢和钢材的平均日产量都在逐月下降。目前西德绝大多数钢铁企业的设备利用率只能达到80％左右；少数企业甚至只能达到60％。
    钢铁工业的不断减产也更加重了西德煤业的销售危机。到6月下旬为止，西德煤业滞销的煤和焦炭总量已经超过七百万吨。另外在若干大消费者手里还积存着没有用完的煤大约一千一百万吨。因此煤的销路在最近期间很难有转机。鲁尔区煤矿主估计到今年第三季度时滞销的库存煤将会超过八百万吨，从而将接近1930—1933经济危机年代滞销存煤量的最高峰——八百五十万吨。
    另外，消费品生产在5月份降低了5.2％，订货减少了10％。许多纺织企业因为订货不足已经被迫缩减和大批解雇工人。
    今年4月份西德的出口额比1957年同期减少了5％，5月份又比去年同期减少6％。这种下降趋势是自从1953年3月以来不曾有过的。
    目前西德的国外订货还在继续减少，人们估计西德工业生产还将因此进一步减退。
    尽管西德经济部长艾哈德至今仍然故作镇静地断言西德经济不会出现“衰退”，但是西德工业界和经济界人士普遍承认，战后西德工业扩张和出口繁荣的“好光景”已经告终。他们对经济中一系列危机征象的进一步发展深为担忧。
