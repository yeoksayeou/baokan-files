Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 8th: To meet the needs of the high-speed development of the steel industry, China's output of refractory materials will increase twofold in the second half of this year compared to the first half, and more than twofold next year compared to this year. This is the leap forward target set by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry at the recent National Refractory Materials Production Promotion Conference.

To produce one ton of steel requires a certain proportion of refractory materials. Therefore, the great leap forward in the steel industry must be preceded by refractory materials. However, the current production of refractory materials nationwide is still lagging behind the great leap forward in the steel industry, mainly because the cadres of many production units have not completely liberated their thinking.

At this National Refractory Materials Production Promotion Conference, the representatives criticized various conservative ideas and mystical views, and earnestly studied the experiences of the Changxing Refractory Materials Factory in Zhejiang and the three refractory material workshops of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. The workers of Changxing Refractory Materials Factory, without funds, equipment, or technical knowledge, highly displayed revolutionary drive and a spirit of perseverance, overcame numerous difficulties, broke down the mystification of technology, and produced more than two thousand varieties and colors of refractory materials in the past three years. The workers of the Second and First Refractory Materials Workshops of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, due to their bold rejection of superstition, completely overturned the "heating curve" technical theory and operating methods that were considered sacred and inviolable in kiln firing, reducing the firing time of clay bricks from more than eighty hours and more than sixty hours to less than ten hours, respectively. The representatives believed that all localities should learn from the experiences of these advanced units to greatly promote the development of refractory materials production.

According to the leap forward plans formulated by various units, the national output of refractory materials this year and next year can basically catch up with the needs of the steel industry.

At the meeting, the representatives also seriously discussed and determined the direction and measures for the great leap forward in refractory materials production in China:

(1) Existing production units should all learn from the advanced experience and advanced thinking of the Changxing Refractory Materials Factory and the refractory material workshops of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, boldly break down superstitions and unreasonable rules and regulations, vigorously engage in technical revolution, and make every effort to tap existing production potential. (2) In terms of capital construction, all localities should implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small scales. Production equipment should be as self-reliant as possible. Wherever there are raw materials, the masses should be mobilized to organize indigenous production on the spot, achieving immediate results with indigenous methods and blossoming everywhere, and gradually realizing mechanization. (3) In terms of the variety and quality of refractory materials, all regions should vigorously organize the production of multiple varieties according to the raw material situation and national needs, and develop the production of advanced refractory materials. (4) Actively strengthen scientific research on refractory materials, and organize regional production collaboration and balance, in order to better promote the development of the refractory materials industry.

    适应钢铁工业高速度发展需要
    耐火材料下半年将增长两倍
    据新华社重庆8日电  适应钢铁工业高速度发展的需要，我国耐火材料产量今年下半年要比上半年提高两倍，明年要比今年提高两倍以上。这是冶金工业部最近召开的全国耐火材料生产促进会议制订出的跃进目标。
    要生产一吨钢，就需要一定比例的耐火材料，因此，钢铁工业大跃进，必需有耐火材料作前哨。但是目前全国耐火材料的生产还落在钢铁工业大跃进的后面，这主要是不少生产单位的干部还没有彻底解放思想。
    在这次全国耐火材料生产促进会上，代表们批判了各种保守思想和神秘观点，认真学习了浙江长兴耐火材料厂和重庆钢铁公司三个耐火材料车间的经验。长兴耐火材料厂职工，在没有资金、设备和不懂技术的情况下，高度发挥革命干劲和钻劲，排除重重困难，打破技术神秘思想，三年来生产了两千多个品种、花色的耐火材料。重庆钢铁公司的第二、第一耐火材料车间职工，由于大胆破除迷信，全部推翻了在烧窑中认为神圣不可侵犯的“升温曲线”的技术理论和操作方法，使粘土砖的烧成时间分别由八十多小时、六十多小时缩短到十小时以内。代表们认为，各地都很好学习这些先进单位的经验，就能大大促进耐火材料生产的发展。
    根据各单位制订的跃进计划，今明年全国耐火材料的产量，基本上可以赶上钢铁工业的需要。
    会上，代表们还认真讨论确定了我国耐火材料生产大跃进的方向和措施：
    （一）现有生产单位，都应当学长兴耐火材料厂和重庆钢铁公司耐火材料车间的先进经验和先进思想，大胆破除迷信和不合理的规程制度，大闹技术革命，千方百计地挖掘现有生产潜力。（二）在基本建设方面，各地都应当贯彻土洋结合、大中小结合的方针，生产设备应尽量自力更生；凡是有原料的地方，应就地发动群众组织土法生产，做到土法上马、遍地开花，逐步实行机械化。（三）在耐火材料的品种和质量方面，各地区都应根据原料情况和国家需要，大力组织多品种生产，发展高级耐火材料的生产。（四）积极加强耐火材料的科学研究工作，组织地区的生产协作和平衡，以便更好地促进耐火材料工业的发展。
