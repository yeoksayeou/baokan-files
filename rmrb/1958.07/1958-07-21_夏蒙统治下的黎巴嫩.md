Lebanon is a small country in the Middle East, with a population of only over 1.5 million and a land area of only over 10,000 square kilometers. However, due to the reactionary policies pursued by the Chamoun government in recent years and Lebanon's geographical location, Lebanon plays a significant role in the imperialist aggression against the Middle East, becoming a tool for US imperialism to militarily threaten the Near and Middle Eastern countries and politically split the Arab national independence movement.

Lebanon is located on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, bordering the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic to the north and east, and Israel to the south. It is not far from the imperialist military bases in Turkey and Cyprus. It is the only way for Middle Eastern countries to communicate with Europe and the United States through the Mediterranean Sea. A large part of the oil plundered by imperialism in Iraq and other places is transported to the West through three oil pipelines passing through Lebanon.

Lebanon, which gained independence after World War II, failed to implement policies that actively safeguard national interests. In particular, after the imperialist agent Chamoun was elected president in 1952, Lebanon finally completely sided with US imperialism and was in opposition to its Arab sister countries. More than a year ago, Chamoun publicly declared that the view that Arab countries could remain neutral was a "fantasy" and that "Lebanon has chosen to stand with the West."

In 1951, Lebanon accepted Truman's "Point Four Program." In 1954, it signed an economic "aid" agreement with the United States. Since then, American fleets and American "tourists" have frequently and conspicuously "visited" Beirut. The influence of the United States increased to such an extent that in 1955, according to Beirut's "Orient Daily," more than 30,000 Americans lived in this small country. In 1956, when Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt in an attempt to seize the Suez Canal, the Lebanese government, under pressure from the domestic people and the unanimous opposition of Arab countries to imperialist aggression, expressed its full support for Egypt along with other countries. However, when the invaders suffered a shameful defeat, Chamoun immediately sought opportunities to serve his masters, forcing Prime Minister Yafi, who had pursued a policy of national independence and firmly supported Egypt, to resign, and appointed Solh, who was in cahoots with him, as Prime Minister. Solh chose Malik, who had served as ambassador to the United States, as Foreign Minister, thereby forming a government of imperialist agents. At the same time, Chamoun prevented the heads of nine Arab countries from delivering a heavy blow to imperialism at a meeting held in Beirut. At that time, according to the Associated Press, the so-called pro-Western forces gained the upper hand, and "the dominant figures at the meeting were the pro-Western Lebanese President Chamoun and Iraqi King Faisal."

After the United States launched the aggressive banner of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," in March 1957, Eisenhower's special envoy Richards, in view of the firm opposition of many Arab countries, chose Lebanon as the first stop on his tour to peddle the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Richards' choice was justified. Richards said that Lebanon "highly understood American policy" and that the two countries "had similar interests." Sure enough, Lebanon became the first country to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine." In order to obtain "US aid," Lebanon attacked national independence movements according to American clichés and offered ports and airports to imperialism. A few days later, Chamoun and Malik went to Saudi Arabia to try to complete another task of betraying national interests, suggesting to the Saudi King that they and Iraq jointly conclude an "anti-communist pact," but they were unsuccessful.

In the autumn of 1957, when US imperialism was plotting to subvert the Syrian government, the Lebanese government played the role of US imperialism's accomplice even more blatantly, even seeking opportunities to provoke border incidents and expel Syrian citizens in Lebanon. Foreign Minister Malik also stated that Lebanon could maintain "good relations" with Turkey, which had stationed troops on the Syrian border. Lebanon allowed Syrian traitors such as Shishakli to enter the country, giving them convenient opportunities to collude with the United States and Turkey in plotting subversive conspiracies.

However, the government controlled by Chamoun, Solh, and others does not represent the people. In April of last year, many political leaders in Lebanon formed the "National Front," demanding that Chamoun maintain national independence, reject the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and condemn the Baghdad Pact. Since May 9th of this year, the Lebanese people have launched an armed uprising against the Chamoun government and against imperialism. The people's uprising has already controlled most of the country and important cities. Chamoun's reactionary rule is precarious, and he has been asking the United States to send troops to assist in order to maintain his regime that is loyal to the United States. From the beginning, US imperialism adopted a policy of open intervention. The Sixth Fleet immediately sailed close to Lebanese territorial waters, transporting weapons to the Chamoun government in a steady stream, and Americans flew planes to bomb the rebellious people. The United States also intervened through others, instigating Iraqi and Jordanian troops to enter Lebanon and attack the rebellious people. The United States also manipulated the United Nations to pass a resolution to send an "observation group," attempting to create a pretext for armed intervention under the guise of investigating the so-called "interference" of the United Arab Republic. When the Iraqi people victoriously overthrew the Faisal monarchy and established a republic, the US Marines blatantly landed in Beirut, attempting to suppress the Lebanese people's uprising and threaten the newly established Iraqi Republic.

### 夏蒙统治下的黎巴嫩

    夏蒙统治下的黎巴嫩
    黎巴嫩是中东地区的一个小国，人口只有一百五十多万，土地面积只有一万多平方公里。但是，由于几年来夏蒙政府执行的反动政策和黎巴嫩的地理位置，黎巴嫩对帝国主义侵略中东起着很大的作用，成了美帝国主义从军事上威胁中近东国家和在政治上分裂阿拉伯民族独立运动的工具。
    黎巴嫩位于地中海东岸，北和东面和阿联叙利亚地区接境、南面和以色列交界，距离帝国主义的军事基地土耳其和塞浦路斯不远。它是中东国家通过地中海和欧美往来的必经之地。帝国主义在伊拉克等地掠夺的石油，很大一部分由三条流经黎巴嫩的油管向西方输送。
    第二次大战后获得独立的黎巴嫩，未能执行积极维护民族利益的政策。特别是帝国主义的代理人夏蒙在1952年当选总统以后，黎巴嫩终于完全倒向美帝国主义，而同自己的阿拉伯姊妹国家处于对立地位。早在一年多前，夏蒙就曾公开宣称：认为阿拉伯国家能够中立的看法是一种“幻想”，“黎巴嫩选择了和西方站在一起”。
    1951年，黎巴嫩接受了杜鲁门的“第四点计划”。1954年，又和美国缔结经济“援助”协定。从此以后，美国舰队和美国“游客”就经常引人注目地“访问”贝鲁特。美国的影响是这样地增加着，以至1955年，据贝鲁特的“东方报”说，在这个小国里，竟然住着三万多美国人。1956年，英、法、以三国进攻埃及企图夺取苏伊士运河时，黎巴嫩政府迫于国内人民和阿拉伯国家一致反对帝国主义侵略的要求，表示和其他国家一道充分支持埃及。但当侵略者遭到可耻的失败后，夏蒙又立刻寻求机会为他的主子服务，迫使执行民族独立政策、坚决支持埃及的雅非总理辞职，并任命和他臭味相投的索勒哈担任总理，索勒哈选择担任过驻美大使的马利克担任外交部长，从而组成了帝国主义代理人的政府。与此同时，夏蒙使九个阿拉伯国家首脑在贝鲁特召开的会议没有能够给帝国主义以沉重的回击。当时据美联社报道，所谓亲西方的势力占了上风，而“会议上具有支配地位的是亲西方的黎巴嫩总统夏蒙和伊拉克国王费萨尔”。
    美国打出了“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略旗帜后，1957年3月艾森豪威尔的特使理查兹鉴于许多阿拉伯国家的坚决反对态度，选择了黎巴嫩作为他兜售“艾森豪威尔主义”旅行的第一个地点。理查兹的选择是有道理的。理查兹说黎巴嫩“高度理解美国的政策”，两国“有着相似的利益”。果然，黎巴嫩成了第一个接受“艾森豪威尔主义”的国家。为了取得“美援”，黎巴嫩按照美国的滥调，攻击民族独立运动，并给帝国主义献出了港口和机场。几天以后，夏蒙和马利克到沙特阿拉伯去企图完成另一出卖民族利益的任务，向沙特国王建议和伊拉克三国共同缔结一个“反共公约”，但没有成功。
    1957年秋天，美帝国主义阴谋颠复叙利亚政府的时候，黎巴嫩政府更加明目张胆地扮演了美帝国主义走卒的角色，竟寻找机会挑起边境事件和驱逐在黎巴嫩的叙利亚公民。外长马利克还声明黎巴嫩可以同曾陈兵叙利亚边境的土耳其保持“良好关系”。黎巴嫩接纳了叙利亚卖国贼施舍克里等入境，使他们有便利的机会和美国、土耳其共同策划颠复阴谋。
    但是，夏蒙、索勒哈等人控制下的政府并不代表人民。去年4月，黎巴嫩许多政界领袖组成了“全国阵线”，要求夏蒙保持民族独立，拒绝“艾森豪威尔主义”和谴责巴格达条约。今年5月9日起，黎巴嫩人民展开反对夏蒙政府，反对帝国主义的武装起义。人民的起义，已经控制了全国大部分的地区和重要城市。夏蒙的反动统治已朝不保夕，一直要求美国出兵援助以便保持他效忠美国的政权。美帝国主义从一开始就采取了公开干涉的政策，第六舰队即刻驶近黎巴嫩领海，把武器源源运给夏蒙政府，由美国人驾驶飞机轰炸起义人民。美国还假他人之手进行干涉，唆使伊拉克和约旦军队进入黎巴嫩，进攻起义人民。美国并操纵联合国通过决议派遣“观察小组”，企图以调查阿拉伯联合共和国的所谓“干涉”为借口，制造武装干涉的口实。当伊拉克人民胜利地推翻了费萨尔卖国王朝，建立了共和国后，美海军陆战队竟悍然在贝鲁特登陆，企图镇压黎巴嫩人民的起义，并威胁新建立的伊拉克共和国。
