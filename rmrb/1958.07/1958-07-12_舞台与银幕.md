	Stage and Screen

	Modern Peking Opera Serial
	The Beijing Emerging Peking Opera Troupe has always focused on performing serial operas. Recently, with a great leap forward, the troupe performed "The New Children's Heroes," a modern Peking Opera serial adapted from Yuan Jing's novel of the same name. The current performance covers the period from the people's guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines to the capture of the traitor He Shixiong. The performance is simple and effectively portrays the determination of the people to resist the Japanese behind enemy lines.
	This is a good attempt based on the troupe's performance characteristics.

	Luoyang Henan Opera Troupe No. 1 Also Performs Modern Plays
	Audiences who love Henan Opera are mostly familiar with the excellent traditional repertoire performed by Ma Jinfeng and others from the Luoyang Henan Opera Troupe No. 1, such as "Mu Guiying Takes Command" and "The Twelve Widows' Expedition to the West."
	This time, the troupe came to Beijing to perform not only the traditional repertoire mentioned above, which has won praise from the capital's audience, but also brought modern plays such as "Mother." It will enable Henan Opera audiences to receive more beneficial education through their favorite art form using modern themes. (Ming)

	"The Silent World"
	This is a French scientific documentary. The filmmakers helped viewers explore the secrets of the deep sea. Seeing all kinds of underwater wonders and creatures we have never seen before, people can't help but think of the infinite richness of nature and its endless wonders to be explored. The film has beautiful colors and moving music, which adds to the poetic elements of the film. (Jiang)

	A Promising Young Pu Opera Troupe
	Recently, the Linfen People's Pu Opera Troupe of Shanxi participated in the performances in Beijing commemorating the 700th anniversary of the dramatic activities of Guan Hanqing, a world cultural figure and playwright of the Yuan Dynasty in China. In addition to a few veteran artists, most of the troupe are young actors cultivated by the Party after liberation. Under the careful guidance of their predecessors, they have reached a certain artistic level, and can perform sincerely, with loud voices, and clear articulation.
	This is a young and promising Pu Opera troupe, and their performance is worth seeing. (Min)

    舞台与银幕
    连台本现代京戏
    北京新兴京剧团一向是以演连台本戏为主的。最近，该团以跃进的姿态，演出了根据袁静的同名小说改编的“新儿女英雄传”连台本现代京戏。现在演出的是从人民游击队敌后抗战，到抓汉奸何世雄这一段。演出朴实，较好的表现了敌后人民抗战的决心。
    这是一个根据该团演出特点很好的尝试。

    洛阳豫剧一团也有现代戏
    爱好豫剧的观众，大多熟悉洛阳豫剧一团马金凤等演出的优秀传统剧目“穆桂英挂帅”、“十二寡妇征西”等剧。
    这次，该团来京演出，除上面所提的这些博得首都观众好评的传统剧目外，还带来了“母亲”等现代剧目；它将使豫剧观众，通过自己所喜爱的艺术形式，受到现代题材更有益的教育。　（明）
    “静静的世界”
    这是一部法国科学纪录片。影片创作人员帮助观众探索了海洋深处的秘密。看了那种种海底奇景和我们从未见过的生物，不由得让人们联想起大自然的无限丰富和它探索不尽的奇迹。影片色彩优美音乐也很动人，这更增加了这部影片的诗意成分。　（江）
    有前途的蒲剧青年队伍
    最近，山西临汾人民蒲剧团在北京参加了纪念世界文化名人、我国元代戏剧家关汉卿戏剧活动七百年的演出。这个剧团除几位老艺人外，大多是解放后党所培养起来的青年演员。他们在前辈的细心教导下，有了一定的艺术水平，能做到作戏真挚、声音嘹亮、吐字清晰。
    这是一支年轻有前途的蒲剧队伍，他们的演出很值得一看。（民）
