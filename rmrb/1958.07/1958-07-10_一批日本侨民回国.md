Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 8th: Today, the twentieth group of 576 Japanese nationals in China returned to their country aboard the Japanese ship "Hakusan Maru."

On April 13th of this year, the Red Cross Society of China announced its willingness to assist approximately 2,000 Japanese nationals in China who voluntarily wished to return to Japan, in batches. Thus, all these Japanese nationals who applied to return home have now been assisted by the Red Cross Society of China in returning to their country.

Before this group of Japanese nationals returned home, the Tianjin Red Cross Society held a farewell party for them. Wu Shifa, Vice President of the Tianjin Red Cross Society, congratulated them at the meeting on returning home and reuniting with their families, and wished the Japanese people greater victories in their struggle for peace, democracy, and independence. At the same time, he sternly condemned the attitude of the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government in yielding to American imperialism, colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and antagonizing the Chinese people. He said: "Kishi Nobusuke has fully exposed his latent imperialist face, but today's China is no longer the old China of the past. If Kishi Nobusuke continues to adhere to this imperialist attitude, he will eventually be bruised and battered!" A representative of the Japanese nationals, Higashi Mouyu, expressed deep gratitude at the meeting to the Chinese people and the Red Cross Society of China for their warm assistance in helping them return home, and expressed dissatisfaction with the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile attitude towards China. He said that the Kishi Nobusuke government's submission to the United States, its sabotage of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement, its connivance at thugs insulting the Chinese flag, and its conspiracy to create "two Chinas" are all contrary to the will of the Japanese people. He said: "We will fight to build a rainbow bridge of Sino-Japanese friendship over the seas separating the two countries, for the happiness of mankind, and for world peace."

According to statistics from the Red Cross Society of China, since 1953, the Red Cross Society of China, in the spirit of humanitarianism, has assisted more than 32,000 Japanese nationals in returning to their country.

    一批日本侨民回国
    新华社天津8日电  第二十批五百七十六名在中国的日本侨民今天乘日本轮船“白山丸”回国。
    今年4月13日，中国红十字会曾宣布愿意协助约二千名自愿回国的在中国的日本侨民分批回日本，至此，这些申请回国的日本侨民已经全部由中国红十字会协助回国。
    在这批日本侨民回国前，天津市红十字会曾经为他们举行了欢送会。天津市红十字会副会长吴士法在会上祝贺他们回国和家人团聚，并祝日本人民在为和平、民主、独立的斗争中取得更大的胜利。同时，他也严厉地谴责了日本岸信介政府屈从美帝国主义、勾结蒋介石集团而与中国人民为敌的态度。他说：“岸信介充分暴露了他的潜在的帝国主义的面貌，但是今天的中国已经不是过去的旧中国了，岸信介如果继续坚持这种帝国主义的态度，终将会被碰得头破血流！”日本侨民的代表东卯雄在会上对中国人民和中国红十字会热情协助他们回国表示深切的感谢，对日本岸信介政府采取敌视中国的态度表示不满，他说，岸信介政府屈从美国，破坏中日贸易协定，纵容暴徒侮辱中国国旗，阴谋制造“两个中国”，这些都是违反日本人民的意志的。他说：“我们将为在隔开两国的大海上修起日中友好的虹桥、为人类的幸福，为世界和平而斗争。”
    据中国红十字会统计，从1953年以来，中国红十字会本着人道主义的精神，已经先后协助三万二千多名日本侨民回国。
