	Secretary Huang Sends Pigs
	One day, Comrade Huang Zhong, the Secretary of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee, came to Shengfang Town in Ba County to inspect work and took the opportunity to visit the pig farming situation in our Guangming Agricultural Cooperative. He asked our cooperative's director, "Why don't you have any foreign pigs or Jinhua pigs in your cooperative?" The director said they were not easy to buy. Secretary Huang thought for a moment and said, "Okay, after I go back, I'll buy you a pair of good breeding pigs."
	More than twenty days later, a person came to find our cooperative's director, driving two small foreign pigs. The director and the breeder saw that these two piglets were so good and quickly asked the person delivering the pigs how much they cost. The person delivering the pigs smiled and said, "Secretary Huang bought these with his own money. He said they are free." We were all very moved at the time, and the director immediately said, "We must raise the pigs well. This year we have more than a hundred, and next year we will develop to more than a thousand, to thank Secretary Huang for his concern for us."

    黄书记送猪
    一天，天津地委书记黄衷同志到霸县胜芳镇检查工作，顺便到我们光明农业社参观了一下养猪的情况。他问我们社长：“怎么你们社里没有洋猪和金华猪？”社长说不容易买到。黄书记想了一下说：“好啦，等我回去后，给你们买一对好猪种。”
    过了二十多天，有一个人赶着两口小洋猪来找我们社长，社长和饲养员一看这两口小猪这么好，连忙问送猪的人要多少钱？送猪的人笑着说：“这是黄书记自己拿钱买的，他说不要钱。”当时我们都很感动，社长马上说：“我们一定要把猪养好，今年一百多口，明年要发展到一千多口，来感谢黄书记对我们的关怀。”
