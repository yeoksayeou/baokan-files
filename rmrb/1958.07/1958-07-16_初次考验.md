Initial Test
    Lin Zhong

Last year, a rainfall of 165 millimeters caused flooding of 22,000 mu of land. This year, a rainfall of 314 millimeters caused no flooding, and the ponds and reservoirs are still not full. This stark contrast in Malan Township, Yanling County, Henan Province, is so evident! And this is not an isolated phenomenon. Throughout Henan Province, many counties' newly constructed water conservancy projects have withstood the test of rainfall of 300 to 400 millimeters without causing flooding.

We warmly celebrate this great victory.

Before the dog days and rainy season arrived, some "wait-and-see faction" and "Monday morning quarterbacks" kept shaking their heads, believing that so many water conservancy projects built in one winter and spring could not guarantee quality, and that the newly built projects could not withstand heavy rain and floods. However, facts prove them wrong. The masses of peasants can not only build quickly and build a lot, but also build well!

The "wait-and-see faction" may still be looking for some accidental reasons to explain what is happening in Henan now, but this is just a waste of time and effort. They should see their fatal weakness and fundamental mistake, which is not seeing "people," not seeing that people are a kind of existence with a nature different from other existences. They can understand, grasp, and use objective laws to transform the objective world and make the objective world suitable for human needs.

The "wait-and-see faction" may not generally fail to see the subjective initiative of people, but they certainly fail to see the great power and wisdom of ordinary workers. They think, how can the problem of waterlogging and drought, which so many enlightened people have failed to solve for thousands of years, be solved by uneducated laborers? And so quickly!

However, history has arranged it exactly like this: it is destined that this great change to reverse the universe will be completed by the uneducated laborers, and can only be completed by them.

"Maybe there will be even bigger rain later, this test doesn't count!" – The first half of this sentence is correct: not only next year and in the future, but even this year there may still be bigger rain. But the second half of the sentence is wrong: this test should count, every test should count, because this is the fact. In the future, there may be larger rains that may cause disasters, but do not forget: our working people have not stopped breathing, stopped working! Their hands are constantly operating, their cause will continue to develop and advance, and their new projects may control even larger rains, so that they cannot harm mankind.

If there is a way to withstand 300 millimeters of rain, there should also be a way to withstand 600 millimeters, 900 millimeters, or even larger rain. The problem ultimately depends on subjective effort. The heroic working people who have already used their subjective efforts to overcome 300 to 400 millimeters of rain should be more likely to understand this principle.

    初次考验
    林中
    去年一次下雨一百六十五公厘，积水成灾二万二千亩。今年一次下雨三百一十四公厘，没有水灾，而坑塘还没有蓄满水。河南鄢陵县马拦乡的这个前后对比，是多么显明啊！而这并不是个别现象。在河南全省，许多县的新修水利工程都经受了一次下雨三、四百公厘的考验，没有发生水灾。
    我们热烈地欢呼这个伟大的胜利。
    在伏天和雨季到来以前，有一些“观潮派”和“秋后算账派”一直在摇头，认为一冬一春修这么多的水利工程是无法保证质量的，认为新修的工程是经不起大雨大水考验的。然而，事实证明他们错了。农民群众不但能够修得快，修得多，而且能够修得好！
    “观潮派”也许还在找寻一些什么偶然的原因，来解释现在河南发生的事情，但这只是时间和心机的浪费。他们应当看到自己的致命弱点和根本错误，就是看不见“人”，看不见人是一种与其他存在性质不同的存在，他们能够认识并且掌握和运用客观规律来改造客观世界，使客观世界适合于人类的要求。
    “观潮派”也许并不是一般的看不见人的主观能动作用，但他们肯定是看不见普通劳动者的伟大力量和智慧。他们想，几千年来多少有识之士都没有解决得了的水旱灾害问题，难道能由没有知识的大老粗们来解决吗？而且是这样的快啊！
    然而，历史却正是这样安排好了的：他注定这个扭转乾坤的伟大变革要由大老粗们来完成，而且只能由他们来完成。
    “也许还有更大的雨在后面，这次考验不能算数！”——这句话，前半句是对的：不但是明年和以后，就是今年也还是可能有更大的雨。但后半句是不对的：这次的考验应当算数，每一次都应当算数，因为这是事实。将来有更大的雨也许可能成灾，但是不要忘记：我们的劳动人民并没有停止呼吸，停止劳动啊！他们的双手不断地操作，他们的事业就会不断地发展、前进，他们新的工程就可能管住更大的雨，使它不能危害人类。
    有办法抗住三百公厘的雨，就应当也有办法抗住六百公厘、九百公厘以至更大的雨。问题终归决定于主观努力。已经是用自己的主观努力战胜了三、四百公厘的英雄的劳动人民，他们应当是更易于懂得这种道理的。
