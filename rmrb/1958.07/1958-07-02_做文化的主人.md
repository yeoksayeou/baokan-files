    Be Masters of Culture
    You Qing

    Today's workers and peasants demand to be masters of nature, and therefore they urgently demand a cultural transformation to become masters of culture. The vast numbers of workers and peasants are diligently studying, and new intellectuals are growing. Many worker and peasant masses, after improving their cultural and scientific levels, are further innovating technology, creating inventions, promoting production, writing books, composing poems, and enriching life. Their enthusiasm is truly unbridled, and their talent is overflowing. Living in such a great era, who can not be overjoyed and inspired?

    For thousands of years in the past, workers and peasants suffered extreme oppression, living a life of poverty and ignorance. Their intelligence and talent were suppressed by the exploiting classes, but even so, they continued to create. Now, they have overthrown the mountains on their heads and cast off the heavy shackles on their shoulders, and their intelligence and talent are radiating with extraordinary brilliance. Wang Zhenhua, a riveter at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory with nineteen years of experience, has persisted in technical study and is now able to design, draft, and trial-produce some new products. Wang Yunsheng, the technical officer of Xizhang Ji Township in Xieyu County, Shanxi, has persisted in learning agricultural technology, and he has experimented with and promoted five new technologies suitable for the local area, such as close planting and improved varieties. Such things, even if they existed in the old society, would have been buried. But now, how many thousands are there like Wang Zhenhua and Wang Yunsheng across the country?

    Some people have doubts about cultivating workers and peasants to become intellectuals of the working class. They believe that workers and peasants have a lower level of education and that it is faster to cultivate students. These people hold the bourgeois view of "gifted education," look down on people from worker and peasant backgrounds, and are even less able to cultivate them according to their characteristics. This kind of understanding and practice is wrong. Education should implement the class line. The working people have become the masters of the country and have the right to be masters of culture, and they are fully capable of being masters of culture. Recently, more than 22,000 students have graduated from 58 worker-peasant rapid middle schools across the country, including more than 10,000 students from worker backgrounds who have completed the basic courses of ordinary middle schools in four years, and their grades are generally excellent. This vivid reality shows that the perseverance of workers in learning culture is no less than that of ordinary students. The speed of learning is also much faster than that of ordinary schools. Workers and peasants are the backbone of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, and the policy of cultivating workers and peasants to become intellectuals of the working class must be resolutely implemented. In the past few months, tens of thousands of people-run agricultural middle schools and hundreds of people-run "Red and Expert" universities have been established. In addition to the many spare-time schools that have been established in the past, industrial and mining enterprises are also running half-work, half-study schools for workers. The establishment of these schools is excellent. We must do everything possible, by every means, to create conditions for workers and peasants to learn culture and technology, so that more workers and peasants can enter full-time, part-time, and spare-time schools to study, so that more workers and peasants can not only enter primary and secondary schools, but also enter universities and research institutes. Let the workers and peasants of the new era become advanced, cultured laborers, and become a strong contingent of working-class intellectuals. At that time, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, the working people of a poor and blank country will write the newest and most beautiful words and draw the newest and most beautiful pictures in their own history.

    做文化的主人
    又青
    今天的工人农民，要求成为自然的主人，因此他们迫切要求文化翻身，成为文化的主人。广大工人农民正努力学习，新的知识分子正在成长。许多工农群众在提高文化科学水平以后，进一步革新技术，创造发明，促进生产；著书立说，吟诗作歌，丰富生活。真是热情奔放，才华横溢。生活在这样伟大的时代，谁能不欢欣鼓舞。
    过去的千百年，工人农民受着极深的压迫，过着又穷又白的生活。他们的聪明才智受到剥削阶级的压抑，虽然如此，他们还不断有所创造。如今，他们已经推倒头上的大山，摔去肩上沉重的枷锁，他们的聪明才智就放出了异彩。太原矿山机器厂有十九年工龄的铆工王振华，坚持技术学习，现在已经能够设计、绘图和试制一些新产品。山西解虞县纁西张羁乡的技术股长王运升，坚持学农业技术，他试验推广了适合当地的密植、改良品种等五种新技术。像这样的事，在旧社会即使有，也都被埋没了。而现在像王振华、王运升这样的事，在全国又何止万千？
    有些人对于培养工人农民成为工人阶级的知识分子有怀疑。他们认为，工人农民文化程度差，不如培养学生来得快。这些人持着资产阶级的“天才教育”的观点，看不起工人、农民出身的人，更不能根据他们的特点来培养。这种认识和做法是不对的。教育应当贯彻阶级路线。劳动人民已经成了国家的主人，就有权利来做文化的主人，而且完全有可能来做文化的主人。最近全国五十八所工农速成中学有二万二千多学员毕业，其中一万多个工人出身的学员，四年学完了普通中学的基本课程，而且一般成绩优良。这一活生生的现实，说明工人学习文化的毅力比一般学生有过之而无不及。学习的速度比一般学校也快得多。工人农民是技术革命和文化革命的骨干，培养工人农民成为工人阶级的知识分子的方针必须坚决贯彻。几个月来，民办农业中学的创办数以万计，民办的红专大学数以百计，工矿、企业除了过去已经办了很多业余学校外，也正为工人举办半工半读的学校。这些学校的举办，好得很。我们要想尽一切办法，千方百计的为工人、农民创造学文化学技术的条件，让更多的工人农民进入全日制、半日制和业余学校去读书，让更多的工人农民不但进小学中学，还要进大学，进研究院。让新时代的工人农民成为先进的有文化的劳动者，成为一支强大的工人阶级的知识分子队伍。到那个时候，正像毛泽东同志所说的那样，一穷二白的国家的劳动人民将在自己的历史上写下最新最美的文字，画出最新最美的画图。
