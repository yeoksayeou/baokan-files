Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 18th (TASS): The Soviet government issued the following statement regarding the U.S. and British aggression in the Near and Middle East:

    On July 17th, the British government carried out an armed invasion of Jordan - British paratroop forces landed in Amman, the capital of Jordan.

    British Prime Minister Macmillan attempted to justify this blatant military interference in the affairs of an Arab country by insisting in the House of Commons that it was to help the Jordanian government "resist aggression," although it is perfectly clear to everyone that Jordan was not threatened by anyone, and there are no facts or materials that can prove the existence of such a threat, and the British Prime Minister has not been able to produce any such facts or materials. The British Prime Minister went on to say that this action by the British government had the full support and approval of the U.S. government. From this, it can be seen that the British government is supporting U.S. aggression, and the U.S. government is supporting British aggression.

    The British armed intervention in Jordan, following the U.S. aggression in Lebanon, proves that the U.S. and British governments have a broad and carefully considered plan to take aggressive action to suppress the national liberation movement in the Arab East. They are attempting to reimpose the shackles of colonial oppression on the people and maintain the possibility of American and British monopoly capital plundering the natural resources and human resources of these countries.

    The British ruling circles made the decision to intervene in Jordan, attempting to restore their colonial positions in the country under the guise of assisting King Hussein. In 1956, at the request of the Jordanian people, the British military advisors led by Glubb, who actually controlled the Jordanian army, were expelled from the country, greatly diminishing the colonial positions of the British ruling circles.

    As can be seen from the British Prime Minister's statement, the purpose of the British armed intervention in Jordan is not only to suppress the movement of the Jordanian people for independence but also to try to gain a foothold in Jordan, and then, using this country and Lebanon, which is occupied by U.S. troops, as military bases for suppressing the revolution of the Iraqi people.

    Currently, the U.S. and Britain are frantically creating public opinion in order to further expand the scale of U.S. and British military intervention in the Arab East.

    It must be recognized that the U.S. and British governments have embarked on the path of armed interference in the internal affairs of other countries, which is absolutely prohibited by international law and the UN Charter. This path of military adventure harbors extremely serious consequences for the cause of peace, and those who embark on this path must realize that the people demand that they be held responsible for such aggressive actions. The British government, in particular, should be very clear about this, especially after the shameful failure of its military adventure against Egypt, that the era when the uprisings of oppressed people could be suppressed and the colonial system maintained by landing colonialist cannons and armed forces in this or that colony or dependency has passed forever.

    Now, hundreds of millions of people in the formerly oppressed colonies have risen to fight for their national rights, and any attempt to obstruct the people of these countries from achieving independence is doomed to bankruptcy. The UN Charter clearly stipulates that the people of all countries have the sacred right to arrange their own destiny according to their own wishes. And the U.S. and Britain have also signed this charter.

    The U.S. and British governments have trampled on their obligations to the United Nations and have become destroyers of peace.

    The aggressors should not forget that the people of all countries, especially the people of the Arab East and the Muslim residents of neighboring regions, will not watch the fate of the people of some countries suffer foreign armed intervention with indifference.

    The people of the Arab East are by no means isolated in their struggle for independence and freedom and against the criminal actions of American and British colonialists.

    The people of all countries angrily condemn the U.S. and British aggressors. Around the world, including in Britain, a wave of resolute protests has been launched against the bloody adventures of the U.S. and British ruling circles in the Near and Middle East. The people of all countries demand an immediate end to U.S. and British armed intervention and demand that U.S. and British troops withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

    The U.S. and British governments have committed acts hostile to peace, and they must be held responsible for the consequences of their aggression against Lebanon and Jordan.

    The U.S. and British governments must stop armed interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries and immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

    The Soviet government believes that the Security Council and the UN General Assembly should, at this critical juncture, fulfill their responsibility to maintain peace, stop aggression, safeguard the national independence of Arab countries that have been unjustifiably violated, and extinguish the flames of war.

    The Soviet government declares that the Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to the unwarranted acts of aggression occurring in regions neighboring its borders, and it will have to take necessary measures for the security of the Soviet Union and the maintenance of world peace.

### 苏联政府发表声明提出警告  美英必须立即停止侵略  苏联对邻近地区发生的侵略将不得不采取必要的措施

    苏联政府发表声明提出警告
    美英必须立即停止侵略
    苏联对邻近地区发生的侵略将不得不采取必要的措施
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社莫斯科18日电：苏联政府就美国和英国侵略中近东事件发表声明如下：
    英国政府7月17日对约旦进行武装侵略——英国的伞兵部队在约旦首都安曼市着陆。
    英国首相麦克米伦企图为对这个阿拉伯国家的事务进行的公开军事干涉辩解，他在下院讲话时硬说，这是为了帮助约旦政府“抵抗侵略”，虽然人人都清楚地知道，约旦并没有受到任何人的威胁，没有任何事实和材料可以说明存在这种威胁，而英国首相也没有能够举出任何这种事实和材料。英国首相继续说，英国政府的这种行动得到美国政府的完全支持和赞同。由此可见，英国政府在支持美国的侵略，而美国政府也在支持英国的侵略。
    英国继美国侵略黎巴嫩之后发动的对约旦的武装干涉证明，美国政府和英国政府有经过广泛周密考虑的、采取侵略行动以镇压阿拉伯东方国家的民族解放运动的计划。他们企图把殖民压迫的枷锁重新加到人民的头上，保持美国和英国垄断资本掠夺这些国家的天然富源和人力资源的可能性。
    英国统治集团采取了武装干涉约旦的决定，他们企图以援助侯赛因国王为幌子，恢复他们在这个国家的殖民主义阵地，在1956年，由于约旦人民的要求，从这个国家驱逐了实际上控制着约旦军队的、以格拉布为首的英国军事顾问，使英国统治集团在很大程度上丧失了殖民主义阵地。
    从英国首相的声明中可以看出，英国武装干涉约旦的目的不仅是要镇压约旦人民争取独立的运动，而且还企图在约旦站稳脚跟以后，利用这个国家以及美国军队所占领的黎巴嫩作为镇压伊拉克人民革命的军事基地。
    目前在美国和英国正在狂热地制造舆论，以便进一步扩大美国和英国对阿拉伯东方国家军事干涉的规模。
    不能不看到，美国政府和英国政府走上了武装干涉别国内政的道路，而国际法和联合国宪章是绝对禁止武装干涉别国内政的。这条军事冒险的道路对于和平事业孕育极其严重的后果，而走上这条道路的人不能不认识到，人民要求他们对这种侵略行动负责。正是英国政府应该很清楚地知道，特别是在对埃及的军事冒险遭到可耻的失败以后应该很清楚地知道，用殖民主义者的炮火和武装部队在这个或那个殖民地或附属国登陆的办法可以镇压被压迫人民的起义和维持殖民主义制度的时代，已经永远过去了。
    现在，过去受压迫的殖民地的亿万人民已经起来为自己的民族权利而斗争，想阻挠这些国家的人民取得独立的任何企图是注定要破产的。联合国宪章明文规定，各国人民有按照自己的愿望安排自己的命运的神圣权利。而美国和英国也在这个宪章上签了字。
    美国和英国政府践踏了自己对联合国的义务，并且成了和平的破坏者。
    侵略者不应当忘记，各国人民、特别是阿拉伯东方国家及其邻近地区的穆斯林居民，不会眼看着一些国家的人民遭受外国武装干涉而对他们的命运漠不关心。
    阿拉伯东方各国人民在争取独立和自由、反对美英殖民主义者罪恶行动的斗争中不是孤立的。
    各国人民愤怒地谴责美英侵略者。在全世界，其中也包括英国，掀起了坚决抗议的浪潮，抗议美国和英国统治集团在中近东的血腥冒险。各国人民要求立刻停止美国和英国的武装干涉，要求美国和英国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    美国和英国政府干了仇视和平的勾当，它们要对它们侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的行动的后果负责。
    美国和英国政府必须停止对阿拉伯国家内政的武装干涉，并且立刻把自己的军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    苏联政府认为，安全理事会和联合国大会在这个紧要关头应当履行维护和平的职责，制止侵略，维护受到无端侵犯的阿拉伯国家的民族独立，并且扑灭战火。
    苏联政府声明，苏联不能对在其国境邻近地区发生的无端侵略行动置若罔闻，它将不得不为苏联的安全和维护世界和平而采取必要的措施。
