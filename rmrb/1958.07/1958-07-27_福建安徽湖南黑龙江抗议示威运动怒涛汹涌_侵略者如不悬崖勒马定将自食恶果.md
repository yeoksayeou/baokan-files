Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 26th: The broad masses of people in coastal Fujian Province, who are constantly fighting against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by U.S. imperialism, have in recent days held various rallies and demonstrations to denounce the piratical acts of aggression against Lebanon and Jordan by U.S. and British imperialism and to support the just struggle of the Arab people. As of the evening of the 24th, two million people in Fujian Province had participated in rallies and demonstrations protesting the U.S. and British aggression in the Middle East.

	The fishermen of Xiamen Island, who are at the forefront of national defense, were filled with anger when they gathered to denounce the aggressive acts of U.S. and British imperialism. Chen Degen, a member of the Qianfeng Fishing Cooperative, said: U.S. imperialism has long occupied our territory of Taiwan, and now it is sending troops to invade Middle Eastern countries. We will never tolerate this. We resolutely support the just struggle of the people of the Middle East and step up our preparations to drive the U.S. aggressors out of Taiwan as soon as possible! The militiamen of He厝乡, who guard the coast day and night alongside the People's Liberation Army and face the Jinmen Island occupied by the Chiang army across the sea, were even more angered after hearing the news of U.S. and British imperialism's aggression in the Middle East. Cai Qingqi, a model of struggle against the enemy, said: We must be a hundred times more vigilant, holding a gun in one hand to continue to defend our national defense with the People's Liberation Army, ready to smash any enemy's invasion at any time; and holding a hoe in the other, stepping up production and construction to enhance our strength to defend the motherland and defend peace. The fishermen and farmers of Dongshan Island, who joined the People's Liberation Army in severely crushing the Chiang army in 1953, also expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the people of the Middle East, raised their vigilance, and defended the motherland's coastline.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26th: The mass demonstration movement in Anhui Province against the U.S. and British armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan is developing vigorously towards the vast small and medium-sized cities and rural areas. Following large-scale parades and demonstrations by the masses in cities such as Hefei, Bengbu, and Wuhu, rallies have been held in more than 60 county towns and nearly 1,000 towns of all sizes in the province in recent days. More than eight million people participated in the rallies and demonstrations, unanimously protesting the aggressive crimes of U.S. and British imperialism and expressing their firm support for the Arab people.

	Shexian, Xuancheng, He County, Dangtu, Tunxi and other counties and cities in the Wuhu area held rallies with tens of thousands of people participating, and held demonstrations. Fuyang, Guoyang, Hao County, Yingshang, Linquan and other towns in the Fuyang area also held rallies and parades. Mengcheng, Nanling, and Feidong counties also held radio rallies. In Mengcheng County alone, 200,000 people listened to the broadcasts. Factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, schools, streets, and rural townships and communes have also held rallies. Many workers in Bengbu, Huainan, Wuhu and other places, after work, regardless of rest, with greasy hands, went to participate in the rally. At the rally held by more than 3,000 farmers in Sanshibu Township, Feidong County, Fei Xianzong, a farmer of the Liaoyuan Cooperative in the township, said excitedly: "The mad dog of U.S. imperialism is coming out to bite people again. We must cut off its claws and knock out its dog teeth, and resolutely prevent it from being fierce."

	The people of the province have also expressed their anger at the U.S. and British aggressors with protest letters. Xuancheng Normal School wrote more than 700 protest letters in one day, angrily condemning the crimes of the U.S. and British aggressors.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 26th: The people of all towns in Hunan Province have continuously held rallies and demonstrations in recent days to support the just struggle of the Arab people. According to statistics from 49 towns including Hengyang, Chen County, Xiangtan, Qiyang, Changde, Shaoyang, and Jishou, more than 1.2 million people have participated in protest rallies and demonstrations.

	Six hundred thousand people in twelve towns in the Hengyang area held protest rallies and demonstrations. Qiyang County also organized a propaganda team of 28,000 people to publicize the Middle East situation to the broad masses of people. In Jishou County, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, 8,000 people held a torch parade, with Shi Yuanji (Miao nationality), the deputy governor, walking at the front of the procession.

	At the protest rally held by 30,000 people in Changde City, veteran Red Army soldier Yang Kunshu said: We firmly support the Arab people and drive U.S. and British imperialism out of the Middle East. A representative of demobilized soldiers said: We will never let the imperialist aggressive conspiracy succeed. If they insist on launching a war, we will beat them until their heads are broken and their blood is flowing, just as we did on the Korean battlefield.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 24th: The people of various places in Heilongjiang Province have continuously held rallies and demonstrations in recent days to support the just struggle of the Arab people, resolutely demanding that the U.S. and British aggressors get out of Lebanon and Jordan.

	The people of Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang and other cities and the people of the Jixi, Hegang, Shuangyashan and other coal mining areas have held protest rallies in recent days. In the rural areas of Qinggang, Baiquan, Lindian and other counties, 500,000 people held rallies and marches, and many people wrote protest letters, strongly protesting the aggressive behavior of U.S. and British imperialism. The members of the Yu Family Agricultural Cooperative in Bohai Township, Ning'an County, worked in the fields during the day and gathered at night to denounce the aggressive crimes of U.S. and British imperialism. The workers of the Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory also adopted various forms of publicity to expose the essence of the U.S. and British imperialist paper tiger. The workers of this factory filled the wall newspapers and blackboards with poems and cartoons they created themselves. Workers made radio speeches every day on the radio station, angrily condemning the U.S. and British aggressors. Bi Liansheng, a municipal labor model, said that the U.S. and British imperialism's armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan this time is an attempt to save its dying fate by creating a war. Its conspiracy will inevitably be shamefully defeated under the firm opposition of peace-loving people all over the world.

	At the rallies, the people of all places also expressed their determination to work hard to increase production in order to enhance the strength of the motherland to defend world peace. The workers of the Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory expressed their determination to put forward more rationalization proposals, and as a result, more than 180 proposals were put forward in less than an hour that day. After continuous research, the workers of the Youth Tunneling Team of the Jixi Hezi Mine created the method of climbing the drill and the method of double-tube blasting, which increased production efficiency by more than five times.
