Xinhua News Agency, July 25th dispatch from Buenos Aires: According to TASS, representatives of the Communist Parties of Argentina and Uruguay recently held talks here on the international situation and the domestic situation of the two countries. After the talks, a joint statement by the two parties was published in "The Times."

The statement condemned the US-British armed intervention in the Middle East.

The statement said that because US-British troops have invaded the Middle East, because many bases of the US and Britain in various parts of the world are on alert, and because atomic weapons are concentrated on the Soviet border, the whole world is on the verge of the most dangerous war using atomic and hydrogen bombs.

The statement pointed out that the delegations of the two countries believe that the most important and urgent task at present is to intensify the mobilization of the working class and the people, calling on them to give the aggressors the most powerful blow, to support the people of the countries under attack, and to make their governments firmly support the Soviet Union's proposal to immediately convene a summit conference to reach an agreement on easing international tensions.

The statement said that the delegations of the Communist Parties of Uruguay and Argentina exchanged views on the political and economic situation of the two countries and the struggle of the two Communist Parties to strive for united action of the working people.

The statement then pointed out: "The representatives of the Central Committees of the two parties believe that it is necessary to further strengthen the ties between the two parties and between the fraternal parties in Latin America and other countries around the world on the basis of the principles of proletarian internationalism. The delegations of the two parties are in complete agreement on the issue of constantly opposing revisionism. Yugoslav revisionism is the most typical representative of revisionism, and it is trying its best to undermine the fraternal unity of the Communist Parties of all countries that follow the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism."

The statement pointed out that the delegations of the two parties are in agreement on the following issues: the ideological issues they face and issues of common concern, and the issue of "expanding the joint action of the people of Latin American countries, opposing imperialism, striving for national independence, and striving for peace."

Comprehensive report from this newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency: The movement against US-British aggression in the Middle East is expanding in Latin American countries.

The United Federation of the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina has begun collecting signatures for a "Peace Petition," calling for an end to Anglo-American aggression in the Near and Middle East.

The Store Clerks Union of the capital of Argentina issued a statement expressing indignation at US-British interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries. The union called for a struggle for universal disarmament, respect for sovereignty, and the right to self-determination of all peoples.

Many social figures and politicians in Argentina condemned the interference of imperialist countries in the internal affairs of small countries. Dr. En. Ma. Sani, First Vice-President of the House of Representatives of the National Congress of Argentina, condemned US-British aggression in a speech and opposed any interference by imperialist countries in the internal affairs of other countries.

Members of the National Congress of Argentina received many petitions from individuals and organizations, requesting that the Argentine representative to the United Nations vote against US-British aggression in the Near and Middle East.

The "Argentine Mothers for Peace Committee" wrote a letter to the Soviet Ambassador to Argentina, Kostylev. The letter said: "Argentine women are deeply disturbed by the events in the Near and Middle East, because this may lead to a third world war... We have told the government that we hope our representative to the United Nations will work hard to strive for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Lebanon and Jordan." "The Argentine Mothers for Peace Committee expresses satisfaction with and supports the Soviet government's proposal to convene a high-level meeting. We Argentine mothers, like mothers all over the world, hope to raise our children quietly."

A delegation from the Argentine Women's Federation of the capital of Argentina and the Province of Buenos Aires handed a letter to the President and Minister of the Interior of Argentina, condemning the imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan.

At the same time, many Arab businessmen in Buenos Aires stopped business on the 22nd to protest against American interference in Lebanon.

The Chilean "El Siglo" published an editorial entitled "No Interference in Lebanon," severely condemning the US-British armed aggression against the Near and Middle East. The newspaper published statements by well-known domestic social figures and politicians denouncing this act of aggression. José Fonseca, a member of the National Congress, said that the American armed aggression against Lebanon is "a blatant manifestation of American imperialist policy." Senator Humberto Martinez believes that this armed intervention "is a violation of the principle of freedom and self-determination of all peoples of the United Nations system."

The Uruguayan "El Popular" published a statement by the Uruguayan General Confederation of Workers, condemning the Anglo-American interference in the Near and Middle East. The statement pointed out that this imperialist aggression violates the principles of the United Nations Charter, and the General Confederation of Workers calls on the working people of the country to support the people of Lebanon and Jordan in their struggle for independence.

The newspaper also published many letters and telegrams from working people and organizations to the government, requesting support for the proposal to convene a high-level meeting, and advocating voting in the United Nations to force foreign troops to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

    阿根廷乌拉圭两国共产党号召人民以行动制止侵略
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯24日讯：阿根廷共产党和乌拉圭共产党代表最近在这里就国际局势和两国的国内局势问题举行了会谈，会谈后在“时报”上发表了两党联合声明。
    声明谴责美英对中东进行武装干涉。
    声明说，由于美英军队已经侵入中东地区，由于美英两国分布在世界各个地区的许多基地处于戒备状态和把原子武器集中在苏联边境，全世界已经处在使用原子弹和氢弹的最危险的战争的边缘。
    声明指出，两国代表团认为当前最主要和最紧急的任务是加紧动员工人阶级和人民，号召他们给予侵略者以最强有力的打击，声援遭受进攻的各国人民，使本国政府坚决支持苏联关于立即召开政府首脑会议的建议，以便就缓和国际紧张局势问题达成协议。
    声明说，乌拉圭和阿根廷共产党代表团就两国的政局和经济状况以及两国共产党争取劳动人民行动一致的斗争情况交换了意见。
    声明接着指出：“两个党的中央委员会代表认为必须在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上进一步加强两党之间的以及拉丁美洲和全世界其他国家兄弟党之间的联系。两党代表团在必须经常反对修正主义的问题上的看法完全一致。南斯拉夫的修正主义是修正主义的最典型的代表，它竭力破坏遵循不朽的马克思列宁主义原则的各国共产党的兄弟团结。”
    声明指出，两党代表团在如下一些问题上的观点是一致的：他们所面临的意识形态问题和共同有关的问题，以及“必须扩大拉丁美洲各国人民的联合行动、反对帝国主义、争取民族独立、争取和平”的问题。

    阿根廷国民大会议员收到个人和一些组织寄来的许多请愿书，其中要求阿根廷驻联合国代表投票反对美英对中近东的侵略。
    “阿根廷母亲争取和平委员会”写了一封信给苏联驻阿根廷大使科斯捷列夫。信中说：“阿根廷妇女对中近东事件感到深深不安，因为这有可能招致第三次世界大战……我们已告诉政府，希望我国驻联合国代表为争取立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军而努力。”“阿根廷母亲争取和平委员会对苏联政府关于召开高级会议的建议表示满意，并且支持这个建议。我们阿根廷母亲像全世界母亲一样希望安静地教养自己的孩子”。

    乌拉圭“人民报”刊载了乌拉圭总工会的声明，谴责英美对中近东的干涉。声明指出，这种帝国主义侵略违反联合国宪章的原则，总工会号召全国劳动人民声援为争取独立而斗争的黎巴嫩和约旦人民。
