Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 7th: The new athletes at the 1958 Xi'an Municipal Level Athletics Games held on the 5th and 6th were more than 40 leading cadres at the municipal level, including Dong Xueyuan, Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Liu Geng, Mayor of Xi'an.

Han Wangchen, the 72-year-old Vice Mayor, and Zhang Fengbo, the Vice Mayor who is nearing sixty years old, usually pay great attention to physical exercise. When Han Wangchen performed the hand grenade throwing demonstration, his movements were agile and quick, and he threw the hand grenade more than 20 meters away without much effort. When these responsible comrades competed with young people, they were all full of energy and showed no weakness. Some responsible cadres participated in the 200-meter "Spoon and Egg Race." The racers held a shallow spoon in their hand, with an egg placed on the spoon. Cong Yiping, a member of the Standing Committee of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, won first place in this competition with a time of 51.6 seconds. Lei Xing, Deputy Director of the Municipal Party Committee's Culture and Education Department, won first place in throwing a 500-gram hand grenade with a score of 49.91 meters.

    运动会上的新选手
    据新华社西安7日电  在5、6日举行的1958年西安市级机关田径运动会上的新选手，他们是中共西安市委书记董学源、西安市市长刘庚等市级负责干部四十多人。
    七十二岁的韩望尘副市长和年近花甲的张锋伯副市长平时都十分注意身体锻炼。韩望尘在作掷手榴弹表演时，动作矫健敏捷，没费多大力气就将手榴弹掷到二十多公尺远的地方。这些负责同志在和青年人比赛时，个个精神抖擞，毫不示弱，一些负责干部参加了二百公尺“杓蛋竞走”。竞走者手执一浅杓，杓上放一个鸡蛋。中共西安市委常委丛一平在这项竞赛中以五十一秒六的成绩获得第一名。市委文教部副部长雷行在掷五百公分重的手榴弹时，以四十九公尺九十一公分的成绩获得第一名。
