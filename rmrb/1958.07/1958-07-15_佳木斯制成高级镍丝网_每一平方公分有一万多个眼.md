    Jiamusi Produces High-Grade Nickel Wire Mesh
    Each Square Centimeter Has Over 10,000 Holes
    China's first 250-mesh high-grade nickel wire mesh has recently been successfully trial-produced at the copper wire mesh workshop of the Jiamusi Integrated Paper Mill. After technical appraisal by relevant departments, the quality fully meets the standards.
    250-mesh high-grade nickel wire mesh is one of the finest mesh types, with over 10,000 holes per square centimeter. This type of mesh is used in precision mechanical industries, the aviation industry, the sieving of rare minerals, the filtration of high-grade oils, and precision scientific instruments. In the past, China could not manufacture it and relied entirely on imports, which were not only expensive but often unavailable.
    Many employees of the copper wire mesh workshop of the Jiamusi Integrated Paper Mill proposed in the third quarter of 1956 to use existing equipment to produce nickel wire mesh. The Party branch strongly supported this initiative, and the administration immediately assigned technicians to work with the workers to begin experimenting. Manufacturing 250-mesh high-grade nickel wire mesh requires the most precise weaving machines and wire drawing equipment. However, the copper wire mesh workshop at that time only had ordinary equipment for weaving 65-mesh to 70-mesh paper-making mesh. Using this equipment to weave 250-mesh high-grade nickel wire mesh had not been done anywhere in the world, nor could any basis be found in weaving industry books. After more than a year of experimentation, they still failed to produce it. After the technical innovation movement was launched throughout the factory, the employees firmly believed that what foreigners could not do, we could do, and what was not in books, we could create. So they continued their trial production. When they encountered problems that they could not solve, they consulted Soviet experts and went to other units to learn. After more than 500 days of hard work and research, they finally succeeded in the trial production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    佳木斯制成高级镍丝网
    每一平方公分有一万多个眼
    我国第一张二百五十目高级镍丝网，最近在佳木斯综合造纸厂铜网场试制成功。经过有关部门的技术鉴定，质量完全合乎标准。
    二百五十目高级镍丝网是最细目网的一种，每平方公分有一万多个眼。这种网是在精密机械工业、航空工业、稀有矿物过筛、高级油类过滤以及精密科学仪器等方面使用的。我国过去不能制造，完全依靠国外进口，不仅价格贵，而且常常买不到。
    佳木斯综合造纸厂铜网场的很多职工，在1956年第三季度提出利用现有设备制做镍丝网的倡议，党支部非常支持，行政立即指派技术人员同工人一起开始试验。制做二百五十目高级镍丝网，需要有最精密的织网机和拔丝设备。可是铜网场当时只有织六十五目至七十目造纸用网的普通设备，用这种设备织二百五十目高级镍丝网，不仅外国没有过，就是在织网工业的书籍上也找不到根据。经过一年多的试验，始终没有制成。技术革新运动在全厂掀起后，职工们坚信外国作不到的，我们可以作到，书本上没有的我们能够创造。于是继续试制。遇到实在解决不了的问题，就去请教苏联专家和到别的单位学习。经过五百多天的刻苦钻研，终于试制成功。　（新华社）
