The ice is three feet thick, and the opening is made,
The thunder roars three times, and the rain comes;
The good news of the Tao River project arrives,
A happy life (ha) arrives.

Seven mountain ridges and eight bends,
The Tao River water will reach the mountain top;
The mountain area's economy will greatly develop,
Catching up with the rich plains.

The swallow carries mud across the Yangtze River,
The carp stirs up big waves;
The Tao River water is brought to the mountain top,
Producing golden rice and grain.

The mules going uphill are faster than horses,
A silk thread serves as a bellyband;
The canal-building lads are at ease,
Come and see after the autumn harvest.

In March, the apricot blossoms are red all over the river,
Surpassing the crimson peony;
Determined to fight hard for two or three years,
Turning the arid Northwest into Jiangnan.

    洮河引上山顶来（甘肃民歌）
    冰冻三尺口子开，
    雷响三声（者）雨来；
    引洮动工的喜事来，
    幸福的生活（哈）到来。
    七道山梁八道弯，
    洮河水要上个山巅；
    山区的经济大发展，
    赶上个富饶的平川。
    燕子衔泥过长江，
    鲤鱼儿翻起了大浪；
    洮河水引在山顶上，
    生产出金黄的米粮。
    上山的骡子比马快，
    青丝线挽下的肚带；
    修渠的阿哥们心放开，
    秋收后看一趟你来。
    三月杏花红满川，
    赛过了紫红的牡丹；
    决心苦战二三年，
    干旱的西北变江南。
