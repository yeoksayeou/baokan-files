Another Peace Initiative
By Our Staff Commentator

On July 2nd, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, wrote a letter to U.S. President Eisenhower, suggesting that the two countries appoint representatives to study measures regarding the possibility of preventing a sudden attack and formulate corresponding recommendations within a predetermined period. The results of the talks between the two countries' representatives could be discussed at a summit conference. This is another new peace initiative by the Soviet Union to promote a summit conference between Eastern and Western countries and to eliminate the "Cold War."

Since the beginning of this year, the Soviet Union has continuously put forward peace proposals and taken many measures to promote the relaxation of international tensions in order to create conditions for holding a summit conference between Eastern and Western countries. However, Western countries, especially the United States, have consistently adopted a policy of delaying and obstructing the holding of a summit conference. On the same day that Khrushchev put forward the above-mentioned new peace proposal, Eisenhower and the heads of government of Britain and France responded to Khrushchev's letter of June 11. In his reply, the U.S. President stubbornly adhered to his policy of obstructing the summit conference. This approach by the United States is the fundamental obstacle to the early convening of a summit conference.

The Soviet Union's positive attitude towards holding a summit conference and the continuous introduction of new initiatives will play an important role in defeating the delaying and obstructing policies of the United States and its partners. The Soviet Union, together with representatives from Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, participated in the East-West nuclear experts meeting, studying with representatives from Western countries what methods to use to detect possible violations after a universal cessation of nuclear testing agreement is reached. Reaching an agreement on this issue will remove the main excuse for Western countries to refuse to stop nuclear weapons testing, thereby helping to promote the realization of a universal cessation of nuclear weapons testing. Similarly, studying measures to prevent the possibility of a sudden attack will also pave the way for reaching an international agreement on this issue. Therefore, the Soviet Union's new peace initiative is an important step in advancing the discussion of holding a summit conference to practical preparations.

In its proposal, the Soviet Union also put forward specific measures regarding the possibility of preventing a sudden attack. These measures are completely feasible and also include some of the proposals that Western countries have made in the past. Therefore, as long as Western countries have sincerity, there should be no difficulty in reaching an agreement on this issue.

It is worth noting that while the United States participated in the East-West nuclear experts meeting and acknowledged that the Soviet proposal to study measures to prevent sudden attacks brought "some hope" to the discussion of this issue, it is also intensifying nuclear armament with Britain and France. Only three days after the East-West nuclear experts meeting, (July 3rd), the U.S. and British governments signed an agreement to exchange nuclear weapons secrets. According to this agreement, the U.S. and British governments will intensify cooperation in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also stated that he would discuss atomic weapons cooperation with French Prime Minister de Gaulle during their meeting. All of this shows that the United States and its British and French partners are keen not on stopping the nuclear arms race, but on intensifying this race. This approach runs completely counter to the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries and the purpose of holding the East-West nuclear experts meeting.

The peace initiatives repeatedly put forward by the Soviet Union and its active efforts to promote the convening of a summit conference have been welcomed and supported by peace-loving people all over the world and have become a great source of encouragement for the peace efforts of the people of all countries. If the United States and its partners continue to adhere to their stubborn attitude, and insist on pursuing their policies of intensifying arms expansion and obstructing the holding of a summit conference, they will only arouse more resolute opposition from the people of all countries.

    又一个和平倡议
    本报评论员
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫本月2日写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，建议两国指派代表就关于防止突然进攻的可能性的措施问题进行研究，并在一个事先确定的期间内制订出相应的建议。两国代表会谈的结果可以在政府首脑会议上加以讨论。这是苏联努力促进东西方国家政府首脑会议和消除“冷战”的又一个新的和平倡议。
    今年以来，苏联曾不断提出和平建议，并且采取了许多促进缓和国际紧张局势的措施，来为召开东西方国家政府首脑会议创造条件。但是，西方国家，首先是美国却一直对召开政府首脑会议的问题采取了拖延和阻挠的政策。就在赫鲁晓夫提出上述新的和平建议的同一天，艾森豪威尔和英、法两国政府的首脑，对赫鲁晓夫6月11日的信提出了答复。美国总统在他的复信中，依然顽固地坚持其对于政府首脑会议的阻挠政策。美国的这种做法，是政府首脑会议不能早日召开的根本障碍。
    苏联在召开政府首脑会议的问题上采取的积极态度和不断提出的新的倡议，对于击败美国及其伙伴的拖延和阻挠政策将发生重要的作用。苏联同波、罗、捷等国的代表一起参加了东西方核问题专家会议，与西方国家的代表研究在一旦达成普遍停止核试验的协定后用什么方法来侦察可能的违约行为的问题。在这个问题上达成协议，就将解除西方国家拒绝停止核武器试验的主要借口，从而会有助于促成普遍停止核武器试验的实现。同样的，对防止突然进攻的可能性的措施的研究，也将为在这个问题上达成国际协议开辟道路。所以，苏联的新的和平倡议是把召开政府首脑会议的讨论推进到实际准备工作的一个重要步骤。
    苏联在自己的建议中，并提出了关于防止突然进攻的可能性的具体措施的建议。这些措施都是完全切实可行的，并且也包括了西方国家过去提出过的一些主张。所以，只要西方国家具有诚意，在这个问题上达成协议是不应该有什么困难的。
    值得注意的是，美国一方面参加了东西方核问题专家会议，并且承认苏联提出的关于研究防止突然进攻的措施的建议给这个问题的讨论带来了“一些希望”，但是另一方面又与英法两国在一道加紧进行核备战。就在东西方核问题专家会议开会后的第三天（7月3日），美英两国政府签订了一项交换核武器秘密的协定。根据这项协定美英两国政府将在制造核武器方面加紧合作。与此同时，美国国务卿杜勒斯并表示，他将在和法国总理戴高乐举行的会谈中讨论原子武器的合作问题。所有的这一切说明，美国和它的英法伙伴热衷的不是停止核军备竞赛，而是加剧这种竞赛。这种做法是与各国人民的和平愿望，以及召开东西方核问题专家会议的目的完全背道而驰的。
    苏联一次再次提出的和平倡议和为促进政府首脑会议的召开所作的积极努力，受到了全世界爱好和平人民的欢迎和支持，并成为各国人民争取和平努力的巨大鼓舞力量。美国和它的伙伴们如果继续坚持它们的顽固态度，一味推行它们的加紧扩军备战和阻挠召开政府首脑会议的政策，就只能激起各国人民对它们的更加坚决的反对。
