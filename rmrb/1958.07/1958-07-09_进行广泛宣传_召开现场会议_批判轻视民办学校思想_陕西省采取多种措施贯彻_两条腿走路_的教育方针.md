    Extensive Publicity Campaign  On-Site Meetings Held
    Criticism of Ideas that Disparage Private Schools
    Shaanxi Province Adopts Multiple Measures to Implement the "Walking on Two Legs" Education Policy

    (Our reporters Qi Yuanzhen and Sun Chuanhao report) Shaanxi Province is actively taking various measures to give private schools equal status with public schools during the great development of education.
    Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Xi'an Municipal Committee convened an education work conference, making the large-scale development of private schools and learning the "walking on two legs" education policy one of the main topics of the meeting. Through the rapid development of education in Shaanxi Province in recent months, the meeting powerfully criticized various erroneous ideas that belittled private schools, and used many vivid facts to prove that private schools and public schools can and should be treated equally in people's minds. After Shaanxi and other regions widely publicized the education policy of promoting both private and public schools, as well as the advantages of private schools, many parents and students began to realize that private schools and public schools have the same educational purpose and actively prepared to apply to private schools. A general survey of the private schools that have already been established is underway to solve existing problems and improve the quality of private schools. In addition, relevant departments have also held on-site meetings in Wufang Township in Huayin County, Yangshan Township in Xi'an, and other places to promote the educational experience of these places and correct people's views on private schools.
    Since the spring of this year, after Shaanxi Province implemented the education policy of "promoting both public and private schools," education has achieved unprecedented development in history. In just over a month, primary education was universalized in thirty-two counties and cities across the province, and 95% of school-age children were enrolled. In Xi'an alone, more than 150 private agricultural middle schools, vocational middle schools, and ordinary middle schools were established, allowing more than 6,500 graduates from higher primary and junior middle schools to continue their education. The masses praised this, saying: "The flowing river never stops, farmers go to middle school classes, they learn culture and engage in production, becoming both civil and military champions."
    However, a small number of people, especially some educational work cadres, do not sufficiently recognize the great significance of "walking on two legs," and they hold formalistic ideas, wanting to be on par with public schools in everything. They believe that private schools are not as good as public schools, and that private schools are "inferior." They have many concerns about developing private schools: they fear that private schools have low quality, that there are no good teachers, that the masses do not welcome them, that the masses cannot afford them, that there is a lack of funding, that they will collapse halfway, that students will not be able to pass exams after graduation, and so on. Therefore, some places cannot fully rely on the masses to develop private schools on a large scale; some private schools that have already been established have not received strong support and assistance from relevant departments; some cadres and some parents are unwilling to send their children to private schools; some students also regard attending private schools as "inglorious"; and some teachers in private middle schools are not focused on teaching.
    After discussing and studying this issue, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Xi'an Municipal Committee, and relevant education departments believe that the main reason is that some leading departments and education work cadres have dogmatic and conservative ideas. They have not started from the needs of socialist industrial and agricultural production development and the interests of the broad masses, and they have not recognized that in our country's current state of poverty and blankness, vigorously relying on the masses to run schools without state investment can rapidly develop education, fully meet the masses' requirements for learning culture, and enable a large number of graduates from higher primary and junior middle schools to continue their education, achieving earlier universal primary education. In An'kang, Ning'shan, Ziyang and other counties located in deep mountains and old forests, about half of the school-age children were originally unable to attend school. The masses urgently requested to send their children to school. They automatically contributed labor and materials, using civilian houses, ancestral halls, and ancient temples as classrooms, building mud platforms and wooden boards as desks and chairs. Without spending a penny of state money, they established more than 2,000 higher primary, lower primary, and comprehensive schools in a few days, basically universalizing primary education. The masses in Lantian County have already established and are preparing to establish 80 private middle schools of various types, such as industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sericulture, with an average of two vocational middle schools per township. These people have not yet realized that another advantage of private schools is that they adapt to local conditions, are simple, and the masses can run schools with very little money. Moreover, because they are part-work and part-study, small-scale, and decentralized, schools are located at their doorsteps, they can participate in labor production, and they can learn, making it convenient for school, work, and food and lodging. The masses welcome them very much, and they are happy to say: "Spending 13 cents (referring to buying chalk) can start a junior middle school class, a handful of firewood and a handful of grass (referring to repairing old houses) can start a good lower primary school."
    After actual investigation and research, relevant departments have proved that the view that private schools have low quality is also wrong. Although the curriculum and classroom learning time of private schools are less than those of public schools, because they learn while working, learn to apply what they learn, and teaching is closely integrated with production, not only has the teaching quality not been reduced, but it has also been improved. Since the establishment of the private middle school class in Wufang Township, Huayin County, nearly a year ago, they have insisted on half-day labor and half-day study. Now the students have begun to master various agricultural production technologies and skills in bamboo work, carpentry, and iron work. Moreover, more than 80% of the students have scored four and five points in five subjects. Poor marks have been eliminated in literature and arithmetic. Students who used to look down on private schools have compared notes with students from public schools and visited teaching situations, proving that the teaching quality of private schools is not lower than that of public schools.
    In order to ensure the great leap forward in education and improve the status of private schools, relevant leading departments proposed to widely publicize the advantages of private schools in the mass movement of running schools by the whole people, to strive for status and glory for private schools through methods such as on-site meetings, and to vigorously train teachers for private schools to adapt to the development of private schools and improve the quality of private schools. At present, we will first adopt methods such as public schools supporting private schools, public school teachers mentoring apprentices, and short-term training. Yan'an Public School and Hanzhong Normal College, which will be enrolling students during this summer vacation, are training teachers for private agricultural middle schools in the Yan'an and Hanzhong areas. The thirteen secondary normal schools that have been sent down to the special commissioner's office and counties and cities will serve as bases for training teachers for private middle schools in various places. After 1961, 40% of the teachers needed for private junior middle schools across the province will be supplied by relevant universities in Shaanxi Province. In addition, graduates of private schools can be promoted to higher-level schools after passing the examination. Students from private schools are also allowed to transfer to public schools.

    进行广泛宣传  召开现场会议
    批判轻视民办学校思想
    陕西省采取多种措施贯彻“两条腿走路”的教育方针
    本报讯  记者戚元珍、孙传镐报道：陕西省在教育事业大发展中，积极采取各种措施，让民办学校和公办学校平起平坐。
    最近，中共陕西省委和西安市委召开的教育工作会议，把大量发展民办学校，学会“两条腿走路”的教育方针，作为会议的主要议题之一。会议通过最近几个月陕西省教育事业飞跃发展的情况，有力地批判了各种轻视民办学校的错误思想，用许多生动的事实证明：民办学校和公办学校完全可以和应该在人们思想上平起平坐。陕西各地经过广泛宣传民办学校和公办学校并举的教育方针，以及民办学校的优越性以后，使许多家长、学生开始认识到民办学校和公办学校具有同一的教育目的，积极准备投考民办学校。对已经办起的民办学校正在作普遍调查，解决存在的问题，提高民办学校的质量。另外，有关部门还曾在华阴县五方乡、西安市杨善乡等地召开现场会议，推广这些地方的办学经验，端正了人们对民办学校的看法。
    今春以来，陕西省贯彻“公办与民办并举”的教育方针后，教育事业获得了历史上空前未有的大发展。一个多月，全省三十二个县市普及了小学教育，95％的学龄儿童入了学。只西安市就办起了一百五十多所民办农业中学、职业中学和普通中学，使六千五百多名高小、初中毕业生升了学。群众赞扬说：“高山流水永不断，农民上了中学班，又学文化又生产，变成文武双状元。”
    但是，有一少部分人，特别是有些教育工作干部，对“两条腿走路”的重大意义认识不足，存在着正规化思想，处处要向公办学校看齐，认为民办学校不如公办学校，民办学校“低人一等”。对发展民办学校顾虑重重：怕民办学校质量低，怕没有好教师，怕群众不欢迎，怕群众负担不起、经费少，中途垮台，怕学生毕了业考不上学，等等。因此，有的地方不能充分依靠群众，大量发展民办学校；有的已经办起的民办学校，也没有得到有关部门的大力支持和帮助；有的干部和一些家长不愿把子女送到民办学校；有的学生也把上民办学校看成“不光彩”的事情；有的民办中学的教师不安心教学工作。
    中共陕西省委、西安市委和有关教育部门在讨论和研究了这个问题后认为，主要原因是有的领导部门和教育工作干部存在着教条主义和保守思想。他们没有从社会主义工农业生产发展的需要和广大群众的利益出发，没有认识到在我国当前一穷二白的情况下，大力依靠群众办学，不要国家投资，可以迅速地发展教育事业，充分满足群众学习文化的要求，使大量的高小、初中毕业生升了学，提早普及小学教育。处在深山老林中的安康、宁陕、紫阳等县，原来有一半左右的学龄儿童不能入学，群众迫切要求送子女上学，他们自动出工献料，利用民房、祠堂、古庙作教室，筑泥台、搭木板作桌椅，没有花国家一个钱，几天就办起了二千多所高小、初小和一揽子学校，基本上普及了小学教育。蓝田县群众已经办起和正在筹备的工业、农业、林业、牧业、蚕业等各种民办中学八十所，平均每乡有两所职业中学。这些人还没有认识到民办学校的另一个优点就是因地制宜，因陋就简，群众花很少的钱，就可办学校，而且又因为半工半读，小型分散，学校设在家门口，能参加劳动生产，又能学习，上学、做活、食宿三方便。群众很欢迎，他们高兴地说：“花钱一角三（指买粉笔），办个初中班，一把柴，一把草（指修补旧房），办了个好初小。”
    有关部门经过实际调查研究以后，证明那种以为民办学校质量低的看法也是错误的。虽然民办学校的课程设置和课堂学习的时间比公办学校少一些，但是，因为边学边作，学以致用，教学密切结合生产，不但没有降低教学质量，而且提高了教学质量。华阴县五方乡民办中学班成立近一年来，坚持半日劳动半日学习，现在学生们已经开始掌握了多种农业生产技术和竹工、木工、铁工等方面的技能。而且，80％以上的学生五门功课都得了四分和五分。文学和算术等还消灭了不及格现象。过去有些看不起民办学校的学生，经过和公办学校的学生比笔记、访问教学情况后，证明民办学校的教学质量并不低于公办学校。
    为了保证教育事业的大跃进，提高民办学校的地位，有关领导部门提出要在全民办学的群众运动中广泛宣传民办学校的优越性，通过现场会议等办法，为民办学校争地位，争光荣，大力为民办学校培养师资，适应民办学校的发展，提高民办学校的质量。目前，先采取公办学校支援民办学校，公办学校教师带徒弟和短期训练等办法。今年暑期即将招生的延安公学和汉中师范专科学校，培养延安和汉中两地区的民办农业中学的教师。下放到专署和县市的十三所中等师范学校，作为各地培养民办中学师资的基地。1961年以后，全省民办初级中学需要的教师，将由陕西省有关高等学校供应40％。另外，民办学校的毕业生，经过考试合格，可以升入高一级学校。民办学校的学生也允许转公办学校。
