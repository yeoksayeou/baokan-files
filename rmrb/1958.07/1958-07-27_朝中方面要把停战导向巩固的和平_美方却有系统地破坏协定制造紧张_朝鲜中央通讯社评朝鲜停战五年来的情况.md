Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 26th. A reporter from the Korean Central News Agency stationed in Panmunjom commented on the US side's violations of the armistice agreement in the five years since the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, stating that the Korean and Chinese side has consistently and strictly abided by the armistice agreement and has made consistent and sincere efforts to maintain the armistice agreement and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

However, the US aggressors and the Syngman Rhee clique have rejected all consultations for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, opposed the peaceful reunification of Korea, continued to clamor for "unification by force," systematically destroyed the armistice agreement, and frantically engaged in military provocations and conspiracies. All processes in the five years since the armistice have proven that it is the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique who are destroying and trampling on the Korean Armistice Agreement and continuing to threaten peace in Korea.

The United States and the Syngman Rhee clique concluded the "US-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" in August 1953, attempting to enable US forces to occupy South Korea for a long time and implement military control, starting with the expansion of armaments in South Korea, to undermine the armistice agreement. In the preparatory meeting for the political conference stipulated in the armistice agreement regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and in Geneva when discussing the Korean issue, the US representatives not only adopted a barbaric attitude of rejecting all fair proposals from the Korean side, but even refused to undertake the obligation to continue seeking the possibility of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to guarantee that peace in Korea would not be threatened. This not only completely violated the purpose of the armistice agreement, but also rudely threatened the Korean armistice.

The US side grossly violated the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, violated the provisions of the armistice agreement and the decisions of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, forcibly detained more than 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, forcibly incorporated them into the armies of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek cliques, and disregarded the armistice agreement on assisting displaced civilians to return to their hometowns, failing to repatriate more than two million displaced civilians who were abducted from northern Korea before and during the war, leaving them to starve and die in South Korea.

After the armistice, the US side seriously violated the provisions of the armistice agreement prohibiting all hostile acts and armed actions by both sides, and carried out various provocative and hostile acts against the Korean and Chinese side. According to the incidents formally raised by the Korean and Chinese side at the Military Armistice Commission alone: in the five years since the armistice, the US side has sent its military aircraft in 616 batches, totaling 1,283 sorties, to intrude into the airspace of the Korean and Chinese side to conduct hostile activities; carried out 174 armed attacks in the demilitarized zone, as well as provocative and hostile acts such as dispatching special agents, sabotage, gun and artillery fire, and illegal intrusions. In addition, after the armistice, the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique frequently sent armed fleets and armed special agents to the northern territorial waters and coastal island areas of the Republic to attack, kill, and kidnap peaceful residents and fishing boats.

Unrestrained by the armistice agreement and the supervision of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the US side illegally transported a large amount of war materials into South Korea, massively expanded the South Korean army, expanding the South Korean army from 16 divisions at the time of the armistice to more than 700,000 men in 31 divisions. Regardless of the just protests of the Korean and Chinese side and the unanimous condemnation of the people of the world, the United States began to obstruct the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and inspection teams in every possible way since the armistice, even beating and shooting members of the commission, throwing bombs at their residences, unilaterally suspended the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Teams in South Korea in June 1956, and expelled them. Then, in June 1957, it unilaterally announced the abolition of Article 13(d) of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which prohibits the introduction of any reinforcing war materials into Korea, and unilaterally notified the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that it would not submit reports on the replacement of war materials to it.

On July 1, 1957, the US side moved the headquarters of the US aggressors, the "United Nations Command," to South Korea, and in October of the same year, transferred the US Army's 1st Cavalry Division, equipped with new weapons, to South Korea, merging it with the US 24th Division and reorganizing it into an "atomic division." In January of this year, it illegally shipped "Honest John" rockets and 280mm atomic artillery into South Korea, and conducted various provocative atomic war exercises near the demilitarized zone. In particular, when the governments of the Korean and Chinese governments took the initiative to promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea, the US aggressor troops not only refused to withdraw from South Korea, but also built missile bases and the US "Fourth Missile Command" near the demilitarized zone. This is a gross violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, a vicious provocation against the Korean people, and a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world.

While stepping up the creation of tension in Korea, the US imperialists are carrying out armed aggression against the Arab people in the Middle East.

However, such adventurous actions by the US aggressors can only arouse the extreme anger of peace-loving people all over the world and accelerate their own demise.

With the support and solidarity of good people all over the world, the Korean people are determined to defend the already achieved armistice and guide it towards a consolidated peace, and must achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    朝中方面要把停战导向巩固的和平
    美方却有系统地破坏协定制造紧张
    朝鲜中央通讯社评朝鲜停战五年来的情况
    新华社平壤26日电　朝鲜中央通讯社驻板门店记者评论朝鲜停战五年来美方违反停战协定的行为说，朝鲜停战协定签订五年来，朝中方面一贯严格遵守停战协定，并且为维护停战协定和朝鲜问题的和平解决，作了一贯的真诚的努力。
    但是，美国侵略者和李承晚集团拒绝一切为和平解决朝鲜问题的协商，反对朝鲜的和平统一，继续叫嚣“武力统一”有系统地破坏停战协定，猖狂进行军事挑衅阴谋。停战后五年来的一切过程证明，破坏和蹂躏朝鲜停战协定，继续威胁朝鲜和平的正是美帝国主义者和李承晚集团。
    美国和李承晚集团在1953年8月缔结了企图使美军长期占领南朝鲜并实行军事控制的“美韩共同防御条约”，从在南朝鲜扩张军备开始，来破坏停战协定。在停战协定规定的关于召开为和平解决朝鲜问题的政治会议的预备会议中，以及在日内瓦讨论朝鲜问题时，美国代表不仅采取了一概拒绝朝鲜方面公正提案的蛮横态度，甚至于拒绝承担继续寻找和平解决朝鲜问题的可能性和保证朝鲜和平不受威胁的义务。这不仅完全违背停战协定的目的，而且粗暴地威胁朝鲜停战。
    美方粗暴地违反关于战俘待遇的1949年日内瓦公约，违反停战协定的规定和中立国遣返委员会的各项决定，强迫扣留朝中战俘四万八千多人，把他们强迫编入李承晚和蒋介石集团的军队中，并无视停战协定关于帮助失所平民还乡的规定，还没有把战争前后从朝鲜北部劫走的二百万以上的失所平民遣返还乡，使他们在南朝鲜陷于饥饿、死亡的境地。
    美方在停战后严重违反停战协定关于禁止双方一切敌对行为和武装行动的规定，对朝中方面进行各种挑衅性的敌对行为。仅据朝中方面在军事停战委员会上正式提出的事件：停战后五年来，美方曾使他的军用飞机六百一十六批、一千二百八十三架次侵入朝中方面地区上空，进行敌对活动；曾在非军事区进行了一百七十四次武装袭击，以及派遣特务、破坏、枪炮射击、非法侵入等挑衅性敌对行为。此外，美国和李承晚集团在停战以后，频繁地派遣武装船队和武装特务到共和国北部领海和沿海岛屿地区进行袭击、杀害和绑架和平居民和渔船。
    美方不受停战协定的约束和中立国监察委员会的监督，非法地把大量作战物资运进南朝鲜，大规模扩大南朝鲜军队，把南朝鲜军队从停战当时的十六个师扩充到三十一个师的七十多万人。美国不顾朝中方面的正当的抗议和全世界人民一致的谴责，从停战以后开始百般地阻挠中立国监察委员会和视察小组的工作，甚至对该委员会的成员加以殴打和射击，向他们的住所投掷炸弹，到1956年6月，就片面停止中立国监察小组在南朝鲜的工作，并且驱逐他们，而后在1957年6月又片面宣布废除禁止向朝鲜境内运进任何增援性作战物资的朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项规定，并片面通知中立国监察委员会将不向它提出替换作战物资的报告。
    美方在1957年7月1日，把美国侵略者的大本营“联合国军司令部”迁移到南朝鲜，并在同年10月把用新型武器装备起来的美军骑兵第一师调来南朝鲜，同美军第二十四师合并，改编为“原子师”。今年1月，向南朝鲜非法运进了“诚实的约翰”式火箭和二八○公厘口径的原子炮，在非军事区附近进行各种挑衅性的原子战争演习。特别是当朝中两国政府为促进朝鲜问题的和平解决而采取主动措施，中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤军的时候，美国侵略军不仅拒绝撤出南朝鲜，反而在非军事区附近建筑导弹基地和美军“第四导弹司令部”。这是对朝鲜停战协定的粗暴的破坏行为，是对朝鲜人民的恶毒挑衅行为，是对远东和世界和平的严重威胁。
    美帝国主义者一面加紧制造朝鲜的紧张局势，一面在中近东进行反对阿拉伯人民的武装侵略。
    但是，美国侵略者的这种冒险行动只能引起全世界爱好和平的人民的极端愤怒，加速他们自己的死亡。
    朝鲜人民在全世界善良的人民的支持和声援下，坚决保卫已经实现的停战，并把它导向巩固的和平，一定要实现朝鲜的和平统一。
