Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The staff of the Beijing Dongdan Post and Telecommunications Bureau have broken down job boundaries and implemented full collaboration. This reform provides a direction for how grassroots postal and telecommunications enterprises can implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and better serve the people.

The specific method of large-scale collaboration is determined according to the busy and slack seasons of each type of work. From the 5th to the 15th of each month, when government agencies and enterprises pay salaries, remittance business is high, so manpower is drawn from the delivery and distribution groups to help the business group with their work. In the last ten days of each month, more people subscribe to newspapers and magazines, and the distribution group is busiest, so the business group and the delivery group draw manpower to support them. Every morning, the business group and the distribution group draw a large number of people to help the delivery group deliver letters and newspapers.

The facts of implementing comprehensive collaboration for more than two months have proved that this approach has significant political and economic significance.

First of all, it has solved the problem that has long existed in this post and telecommunications bureau: "newspapers and letters are delivered late, and queues form at business windows during busy periods," which has won the praise of the masses. In the past, under normal publishing conditions, the delivery time for newspapers was generally completed by 8:30 AM. Now, they can be delivered to subscribers by 6:40 AM every morning. With the earlier delivery time of newspapers, the first batch of letters, which used to be delivered to recipients by 11:00 AM, is also delivered by 9:00 AM. The number of business windows has increased from seven to ten on busy days, and the queuing phenomenon has been eliminated. It used to take half an hour to process remittances, but now it can be completed in less than five minutes.

Secondly, it has saved manpower. The number of business clerks in this post and telecommunications bureau has now been reduced from 18 to 13, delivery staff from 33 to 28, and distribution staff from 12 to 11. One cadre has also been saved. A total of 12 people have been saved throughout the bureau, accounting for 16.5% of the original total number of employees. These saved personnel have been transferred to other post offices or have opened mobile service businesses.

Implementing comprehensive collaboration is a good way for grassroots postal and telecommunications workers to become all-rounders. It promotes the active learning of various postal and telecommunications businesses among the broad masses of workers, making them all-round talents in postal and telecommunications business.

Communist ideas have grown among the staff of the entire bureau. From practice, the staff have realized that "there is no difference between noble and humble labor, only differences in division of labor." Some young workers who were not happy with delivery work have settled down after seeing the bureau director, business clerks, and distribution staff helping them deliver letters and newspapers every morning. Now the enthusiasm for labor among the staff of the entire bureau is extremely high.

    北京东单邮电局找到改进业务的好办法
    打破工种界限  实行全面协作
    据新华社23日讯　北京东单邮电局职工打破工种界限，实行全面大协作。这一改革给基层邮电企业如何贯彻多、快、好、省的方针，更好地为人民服务，提供了一个方向。
    大协作的具体办法是根据各工种业务忙闲的规律确定的。每月5日到15日，正逢机关、企业发薪，汇兑业务多，便从投递组和发行组中抽调人力帮助营业组进行工作。每月下旬订报刊的人多，发行组最忙，营业组和投递组就抽出力量来支援。每天早晨营业组和发行组抽出大批力量帮助投递组送信、送报。
    实行全面大协作两个多月来的事实证明，这样作有重大的政治和经济意义。
    首先是解决了这个邮电局长期存在的“报、信投送时间晚，忙时营业窗口排队”的问题，得到了广大群众的称赞。报纸每天的投送时间，过去在出版正常的情况下，一般在早八时半投送完毕，现在每天早晨六点四十分就可以送到订户手中。随着报纸投送时间的提前，过去上午十一时才能送到收户手中的第一班信，也提前到九点送完。繁忙日营业窗口从七个增加到十个，排队现象消除了。过去办理汇兑要等半小时，现在不到五分钟就可以办完。
    其次是节省了人力。这个邮电局现在营业员已从十八人减为十三人，投递员由三十三人减为二十八人，发行员由十二人减为十一人，干部也节省下来一个。全局共节省出十二人，占原职工总数的16.5％。节省出来的这些人已调往其他邮局或开辟流动服务业务。
    实行全面大协作是基层邮电职工成为多面手的一种好方法，它促使广大职工积极学习各种邮电业务，成为邮电业务方面的全能人材。
    共产主义思想在全局职工中成长起来了。职工们从实践中体会到“劳动没有贵贱的差别，只有分工的不同”。一些不安心投递工作的青年职工，看到局长、营业员、发行员每天早晨帮助他们送信、送报，也安下心来。现在全局职工劳动热情极其高涨。
