Internal Divisions within Western Ruling Groups
Many Politicians Lack Confidence in Aggressive Actions
Xinhua News Agency Report: According to Xinhua News Agency, serious divisions have emerged within the ruling groups of the United States and Britain regarding the Middle East issue. Some members of the U.S. Congress and leaders of the British Labour Party have expressed opposition to the government's armed intervention in the Middle East, calling for a change in this disastrous approach.

    Some U.S. Congressmen Criticize the Government's Belligerent Attitude
    Pointing out that Military Intervention in the Middle East Will Repeat the Anglo-French Aggression Against Egypt
    In the United States, beneath the frenzied, warmongering tide that clamors for expanding aggression and intensifying the suppression of national independence movements in the Middle East, an undercurrent of worry, fear, and discontent is flowing within the ruling group.
    A United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 17th described the atmosphere in Congress this way: "In Congress, members generally appear heavy and fearful."
    Another Associated Press dispatch said that among members of Congress, although the "basic attitude in public" is to support the U.S. government's actions, many members are privately unhappy and some "strong dissenting opinions" can be heard. This news agency also reported that there is rarely such an "atmosphere of uncertainty" in Washington as there is now.
    Under Secretary of State Herter was questioned for more than two hours on the development of the Middle East situation at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 16th. Democratic Senator Humphrey criticized the government's action of sending troops to Lebanon, saying, "We are imitating the approach that Britain and France have already failed with in the Arab world." He said that this intervention "will virtually destroy our position in Asia, Africa, and Latin America."
    Another Democratic Senator, Kennedy, said that senators attending the meeting had a certain "general feeling" that U.S. intervention was an "unwise move." Senator Fulbright called for a re-evaluation of U.S. military, diplomatic, and intelligence representatives abroad.
    Democratic Congressman Roush said that the U.S. President "should not intervene in the Middle East without consulting Congress." He said that the U.S. government's actions "not only carry the danger of causing a Third World War, but also the danger of a moral upheaval in a large part of the world that has not assumed obligations."
    Indiana Republican Senator Jenner condemned the government's action of sending troops to Lebanon. He said, "The government has no right" to "create hysteria and send soldiers to Lebanon to die." He said: "Remember the Korean War, it's a war you can't win, all you can do is get stuck there and wait to die."
    Kentucky Republican Senator Cooper said he thought it was unwise to deploy troops to Lebanon because the forces at play in the Middle East cannot be suppressed by force.
    Oregon Democratic Senator Morse told reporters: "Feudal monarchical old regimes cannot be saved with dollars, and I doubt whether it is possible to save them with American armed forces."

    Greek United Democratic Left Party Demands Government Publicly Declare
    That Greek Territory Will Not Be Used as a Base by Aggressors
    The Executive Committee of the Greek United Democratic Left Party issued a statement strongly condemning the U.S. aggression against Lebanon, which "threatens world peace, the cause of Cyprus' liberation, the future of Greece, and the lives of millions of people in the Middle East." The statement pointed out that the driving force behind the imperialist countries' open intervention in the Arab people's great national independence movement is the dirty interests of large oil merchants and other monopoly capital.
    The statement specifically pointed out that the imperialists intend to use Cyprus as a bridgehead for attacking the Arab people.
    The Executive Committee of the United Democratic Left Party demanded that the Greek government publicly declare: that it will not allow Greek territory to be used as a base for American, British, and French aggressors, that it supports the Arab people in their struggle, and that it abolish the agreement on participating in the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

    Bevan Warns the British Government in the House of Commons Debate
    Aggression Against the Middle East Will Lead Britain Down a Path of Destruction
    British Labour Party foreign affairs spokesman Bevan warned the government in the House of Commons debate on the Middle East situation on the 16th not to follow the example of the United States and send troops to Jordan and Iraq. He expressed concern that the same "far-fetched" excuse that the United States used to land troops in Lebanon would become an excuse for the British government to send troops to Jordan and Iraq.
    Bevan said: "We warn the government that if it does this, it will be responsible for dividing the country. We believe that such an action will lead this country down an endless path of destruction."
    Bevan said that he "does not believe for a moment that trying to obtain Middle East oil by naked military means is in the best interests of this country." He advocated obtaining Middle East oil "through normal commercial transactions, plus flexible diplomacy."
    Referring to Lloyd's visit to the United States, Bevan said: "I hope the Prime Minister sends the Foreign Secretary with a letter to the President of the United States saying: We cannot join the Americans in military adventures in the Middle East."
    Bevan's words won cheers from many Labour MPs.
    Observers pointed out that Bevan's tone and emphasis were very different from the earlier speech by Labour leader Gaitskell. Gaitskell only criticized this policy of military intervention in terms of its methods. He believed that intervention should be carried out under the banner of the United Nations. He feared that this naked military intervention would further heighten the national independence movement in the Middle East.
    Labour MP Richard Crossman warned in the "Daily Mirror" of the possible consequences of British and American intervention. He wrote that the situation in Baghdad "will end in another crushing failure of British and American policy."

    U.S. Retired Brigadier General Holdridge
    Condemns U.S. Aggression Against Lebanon as a Mad Criminal Act
    Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations Sobolev received a telegram on the 16th. The content is as follows:
    "Russia's position on the Lebanon issue is correct. The United States' invasion of Lebanon to protect the international oil cartel foreshadows the killing of many American youths, which proves the mad criminal acts of American leaders. U.S. troops must withdraw immediately.
    I request that this telegram be distributed to all representatives.
    U.S. Army Retired Brigadier General Holdridge, Sherman Oaks, California."

    Divergent Views on the Prospects of Intervention
    Chaos in New York and London Stock Markets
    Due to differences in opinion among the American and British bourgeoisie regarding the prospects of intervention, the New York and London stock markets have been in chaos for the past two days.
    After the success of the Iraqi revolution, New York stock prices plummeted on the 14th and 15th, and stockbrokers dumped large amounts of oil stocks. On the morning of the 16th, after U.S. troops landed in Lebanon, so-called "war stocks," such as steel and aircraft industry stocks, led the rise, and the average price of various stocks in the entire stock market rose to the highest point of the year.
    At noon on the 16th, stock prices suddenly fell again. According to UPI, this was because the Soviet government's statement on the Near and Middle East events reached Wall Street, and the Soviet demand that U.S. troops withdraw from Lebanon was considered "bad news."
    London stock prices have been falling continuously since the Iraqi events. Oil stocks fell the most, and other industrial stocks also generally fell. The stock price index fell a total of 1.5 points to 174.3.
    In addition, the pound also fell significantly. The price of gasoline rose half a penny per gallon on the 16th.

    西方国家统治集团内部意见分歧
    不少政界人士对侵略行动缺乏信心
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息，美英两国统治集团内部在中东问题上发生了严重的分歧。美国一部分议员和英国工党领袖，对政府武装干涉中东的行为表示反对，要求改变这种将会导致灾难的做法。
    美国部分议员抨击政府的好战态度
    指出对中东的军事干涉将蹈英法侵埃复辙
    在美国，在叫嚣要扩大侵略，加紧镇压中东的民族独立运动这种疯狂的好战潮流下面，一股担忧、畏惧和不满的潜流正在统治集团内部流动着。
    合众国际社17日自华盛顿发出的一条消息是这样来描写国会的气氛的，这条消息说，“在国会里，议员们普遍都显出沉重和恐惧的样子。”
    另一条美联社消息说，在国会议员中，尽管“公开的基本态度”是支持美国政府的行动的，但是许多议员私下里并不高兴，而且可以听到一些“表示坚决反对的意见”。这家通讯社还有一条消息说，在华盛顿很少像现在这样存在一种“前途莫测的气氛”。
    副国务卿赫脱为中东事态的发展于16日在参议院外交委员会受到两个多小时的质问。民主党参议员汉弗莱抨击政府派兵去黎巴嫩的行动，他说，“我们仿效了英、法两国早已在阿拉伯世界失败了的一套作法。”他说，这种干涉“实际上会摧毁我们在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的地位”。
    另一个民主党参议员肯尼迪说，出席这次会议的参议员们有某种“总的感觉”，认为美国的干涉是“不明智的行动”。参议员富布赖特要求重新估计美国在国外的军事、外交和情报代表。
    民主党众议员劳斯说，美国总统“不应该在没有同国会商量的情况下在中东进行干涉”。他说，美国政府的行动“不仅有引起第三次世界大战的危险，并且还有使未承担义务的世界的一大部分在道义上发生激变的危险”。
    印第安纳州共和党参议员詹鲁纳尔谴责政府派兵去黎巴嫩的行动。他说，“政府没有权利”来“制造歇斯底里和把士兵们派到黎巴嫩去送死”。他说：“记住朝鲜战争，这是个你不能打胜的战争，你所能做的就是耽在那里等死”。
    肯塔基州共和党参议员库柏说，他认为调动军队去黎巴嫩是不明智的，因为在中东起作用的力量是不能够用武力压制下去的。
    俄勒冈州民主党参议员莫尔斯对记者说：“封建君主旧政体无法用美元来挽救，而且我也怀疑是否有可能用美国武装力量来挽救它”。
    希腊统一民主左翼党要求政府公开声明
    不许希腊领土被侵略者用作基地
    希腊统一民主左翼党执行委员会发表声明，严厉谴责美国对黎巴嫩的侵略“使世界和平、使塞浦路斯的解放事业、使希腊的前途和中东千百万人的生命”受到威胁。声明指出，促使帝国主义国家对阿拉伯人民的伟大的民族独立运动进行公开的干涉的是大石油商和其他垄断资本的肮脏利益。
    声明特别指出，帝国主义者打算利用塞浦路斯作为进攻阿拉伯人民的桥头堡。
    统一民主左翼党执行委员会要求希腊政府公开声明：它不允许利用希腊领土作为美国、英国和法国侵略者的基地，它支持斗争中的阿拉伯人民并且废除关于参加“艾森豪威尔主义”的协定。
    比万在下院辩论中警告英国政府
    侵略中东将使英国踏上毁灭的道路
    英国工党外交发言人比万16日在下院关于中东局势的辩论中警告政府：不要追随美国的榜样，派军队到约旦和伊拉克去。他表示担心美国派军队在黎巴嫩登陆的那种“牵强的”借口同样会成为英国政府派军队到约旦和伊拉克去的借口。
    比万说：“我们警告政府：如果政府这样做，它就要负使国家分裂的责任。我们相信，这样一种行动将使这个国家踏上没有尽头的毁灭的道路。”
    比万说，他“一刻也不相信用赤裸裸的军事手段去设法取得中东的石油是符合这个国家的最大利益的”。他主张“用正常的商业交易，加上灵活的外交手段”去获得中东的石油。
    提到劳埃德对美国的访问，比万说：“我希望首相派外交大臣去时带有给美国总统的这样的信件：我们不能跟美国人一起在中东进行军事冒险。”
    比万的话赢得了许多工党议员的欢呼。
    观察家们指出，比万发言的语气和着重点同早些时候工党领袖盖次克尔的发言有很大的不同。盖次克尔只是从方式方法上批评这种军事干涉政策。他认为，应该打着联合国的旗子去进行干涉。他担心，这种赤裸裸的军事干涉会使得中东的民族独立运动更加高涨。
    工党议员理查德·克罗斯曼在“每日镜报”上警告英美进行干涉可能引起的后果，他写道，巴格达局势“将以英美政策的又一次惨重失败而告终”。
    美国退伍准将霍尔德里斯
    谴责美国侵略黎巴嫩是疯狂的犯罪行为
    苏联驻联合国的常驻代表索波列夫16日收到一封电报。内容如下：
    “俄国对黎巴嫩问题的立场是正确的。美国为了保卫国际石油卡特尔而侵入黎巴嫩，这预示着许多美国青年将被杀害，这证明美国领袖的疯狂的犯罪行为。美国军队必须立即撤退。
    我请求把这封电报分发给各位代表。
    美军退伍准将霍尔德里斯于加利福尼亚州歇尔曼—奥克斯”。
    对干涉前途看法分歧
    纽约伦敦股票市场混乱
    由于美英资产阶级对干涉行动的前途看法有分歧，纽约和伦敦的股票市场最近两天陷于一片混乱。
    在伊拉克革命成功后，纽约股票价格14日、15日狂跌，股票经纪人大量抛出石油股票。16日早上，在美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆以后，一些所谓“战争股票”，例如钢铁和飞机工业的股票带头上涨，整个股票市场各种股票的平均价格上涨到今年以来的最高点。
    16日中午，股票行市又突然下跌，据合众社说，这是由于苏联政府就中近东事件发表的声明传到华尔街，苏联要求美国军队撤出黎巴嫩被认为是一个“坏消息”。
    伦敦的股票行市在伊拉克的事件后不断下跌。石油股票跌得最多，其他工业股票也普遍下跌。股票价格指数一共下降了一点五，降为一七四点三。
    此外，英镑也跌得很多。每加仑汽油价格在16日上涨半便士。
