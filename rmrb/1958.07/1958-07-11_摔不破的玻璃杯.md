Unbreakable Glass

Mothers are most reluctant to let children use glass cups when drinking water, because glass cups will shatter if dropped on the ground. Recently, the Shanghai Gancheng Glass Factory successfully trial-produced a type of unbreakable glass. This type of cup is slightly thicker than ordinary glass cups, and will not break when dropped from a height of one meter. These cups will be available on the market soon, and will cost about 70 cents each.

In addition, the Shanghai Zhonghua Enamel Factory has also successfully trial-produced a type of enamel plate that is not afraid of being dropped.

    摔不破的玻璃杯
    小孩子喝水的时候，妈妈们最不愿意让他们用玻璃杯子，因为玻璃杯掉在地上就会摔得粉碎。最近上海市干成玻璃厂试制成功了一种摔不碎的玻璃杯。这种杯子比一般玻璃杯稍厚一些，在一公尺高的地方摔下去不会破。这种杯子不久就可上市，大约七角多钱就可买一个。
    另外，上海中华搪瓷厂也试制成功了一种不怕摔的搪瓷盘子。
