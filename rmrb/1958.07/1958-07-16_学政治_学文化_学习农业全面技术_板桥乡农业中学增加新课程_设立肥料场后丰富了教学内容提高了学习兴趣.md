    Banqiao Township Agricultural Middle School Adds New Courses
    Establishment of Fertilizer Plants Enriches Teaching Content and Enhances Learning Interest
    (Our Correspondent Zhu Bingju reports) The seven agricultural middle schools in Banqiao Township, Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, have recently boldly established four fertilizer plants, adding new content to their teaching and opening up a path for cultivating new socialist laborers for the vast countryside.

    The four fertilizer plants established by these seven agricultural middle schools include one bacterial fertilizer plant and three granular fertilizer plants. The bacterial fertilizer plant has already begun production, producing bacterial fertilizer for more than 1,000 mu of land every day. After the agricultural middle schools established fertilizer plants, the content of students’ work-study program was enriched. Every morning, batches of agricultural middle school students in this township get up in the dark to work in the fields, singing while they work. They work until about seven o'clock in the morning, then go home to get their schoolbags and go to school. In the afternoon, some go to the fertilizer plant, and some continue to produce in the fields. In terms of curriculum arrangement, in addition to maintaining the original Chinese and mathematics, a certain amount of time is taken from the agricultural knowledge class to learn industrial knowledge, so that students have both agricultural knowledge and a certain amount of industrial knowledge. After the classroom lectures, the students carry out actual production operations. Many farmers praised, saying: "The students of the agricultural middle school are really good. They are farmers and also understand industrial knowledge. They will be our technical instructors in the future." The establishment of fertilizer plants by agricultural middle schools in Banqiao Township and the addition of new content to teaching meet the needs of the township and commune's industrial and agricultural development and cultivate talents for the township and commune's industrial and agricultural production.

    After the agricultural middle schools in Banqiao Township established fertilizer plants, they directly supported agricultural production and solved the difficulty of fertilizer shortage that the township urgently needed to solve. After achieving a bumper summer harvest, the farmers of Banqiao Township also proposed a target of applying 2,000 dan of fertilizer per mu and striving for a rice yield of 4,000 jin per mu. In order to achieve this goal, the masses broke superstitions, dismantled stoves and earthen walls in every household, and tried every means to develop fertilizer sources, but the fertilizer was still insufficient. The students of the agricultural middle school quickly and well established four fertilizer plants through visits and studies. The fertilizer produced was tested by relevant departments and found to be of good quality, which can solve the bacterial fertilizer needed for more than 20,000 mu of land in the township. This timely helped the agricultural cooperatives solve the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer. Now, the township can fully seize the production season and apply topdressing fertilizer in a timely manner, ensuring increased rice production.

    The establishment of fertilizer plants by agricultural middle schools in Banqiao Township is also conducive to the further consolidation of agricultural middle schools. After the agricultural middle schools in the township had their busy farming leave, the attendance rate of students dropped significantly. Some schools only had a few students after classes resumed. Therefore, some agricultural middle school teachers were worried that the school would not be able to continue, and they conducted home visits all day long to mobilize students to enroll, but the attendance rate was still not high. Since the agricultural middle school established a fertilizer plant, students have enrolled one after another, and many students who are not from the agricultural middle school have also asked to attend. Because the agricultural middle school established a fertilizer plant, new courses were added to the teaching, the teaching content was enriched, and students learned more widely, which further stimulated the enthusiasm of teachers and students, teaching and learning. In addition, after the fertilizer plant was established, the students’ learning and labor were specifically arranged, which solved the practical difficulties in the students’ lives. This also eliminated the parents’ concerns that their children’s schooling would affect their labor income, so that students could concentrate on their studies. Wang Guoqiang, deputy secretary of the Banqiao Township Party Committee, said: Now the members are satisfied, the teachers are satisfied, the students are satisfied, and the parents are also satisfied.

    The establishment of fertilizer plants by agricultural middle schools has also encountered difficulties, but teachers and students have overcome the difficulties by adopting the method of learning, teaching, and doing at the same time. Jin Zhiyao, a full-time teacher at the Sixth Agricultural Middle School, bought books and actively studied them. Now he has given two lectures to students on the method and benefits of making granular fertilizer. The Second and Seventh Agricultural Middle Schools organized students, teachers, and members to visit and study at nearby fertilizer plants, and then widely taught them to the students. They also invited cadres from the supply and marketing cooperatives to give lectures and business guidance to the agricultural middle school students. The houses and equipment were all helped by the agricultural cooperatives. Now the Banqiao Township Party Committee is strengthening its leadership over these four fertilizer plants. In order to run the fertilizer plants well, the township party committee also transferred the party branch secretary of the Tenth Cooperative to be the full-time director of the bacterial fertilizer plant and equipped him with two accountants. The other three granular fertilizer plants are all headed by the cooperative director or the party branch secretary. The fertilizer produced by these four fertilizer plants is uniformly distributed by the township party committee. In order to strengthen the leadership of the students, many cooperative branch secretaries have made reports to the students, initially establishing the idea of being a laborer who is both worker and farmer among the students, and improving the students' enthusiasm for learning industrial and agricultural production knowledge.

    学政治　学文化　学习农业全面技术
    板桥乡农业中学增加新课程
    设立肥料场后丰富了教学内容提高了学习兴趣
    本报讯　记者朱冰菊报道：江苏省江阴县板桥乡七所农业中学最近大胆地办起了四个肥料场，教学上增加了新的内容，为广大农村培养新型社会主义劳动者开辟了道路。
    这七所农业中学办起的四个肥料场，一个是细菌肥料场，三个是颗粒肥料场。现在细菌肥料场已开始投入生产，每天生产一千多亩地的细菌肥料。农业中学办肥料场后，学生半工半读的内容丰富了。每天清晨这个乡都有成批的农业中学学生摸黑起身下田劳动，他们在田里一边劳动，一边歌唱。他们劳动到早上七时左右，纷纷回家拿了书包上学校，下午有的进肥料场，有的继续下田生产。在课程的安排上，除了保持原有的语文和数学外，在农业知识课上，抽出一定的时间学习工业知识，这样使学生既有一定的农业知识，又具备一定的工业知识。在课堂讲课以后，学生们就进行实际生产操作。很多农民都称赞地说：“农业中学的学生真好，是农民，又懂得工业知识，将来是我们的技术指导员”。板桥乡的农业中学办肥料场，教学上增加新的内容是适应乡、社工农业发展的需要，为乡、社工农业生产培养人材。
    板桥乡的农业中学办肥料场后，直接支援了农业生产，解决了这个乡迫切需要解决的缺乏肥料的困难。板桥乡农民在取得夏熟丰收后，又提出了每亩施肥二千担，争取水稻亩产四千斤的指标。为了实现这个指标，群众大破迷信，家家拆灶头，拆土墙，千方百计开辟肥源，但肥料仍不足。农业中学的学生通过参观和学习又快又好地办起了四个肥料场，生产出的肥料经有关部门检验质量良好，可以解决全乡二万多亩地所需要的细菌肥料。这就及时地帮助农业社解决了肥料不足的困难。现在这个乡完全可以抓住生产季节，适时追肥，水稻增产有了保证。
    板桥乡农业中学办肥料场、也有利于农业中学的进一步巩固。这个乡的农业中学在放忙假后学生的出席率显著下降，有的学校在复课后只到了几个学生。因此有些农业中学的教师耽心学校要办不成了，整天进行家庭访问，动员学生入学，但出席率仍然不高。自从农业中学办肥料场后，学生都纷纷入学了，很多不是农业中学的学生也要求上学。由于农业中学办了肥料场，在教学上增加了新课程，丰富了教学内容，学生学习的知识更加广泛了，更发挥了教师和学生、教学和学习的积极性。此外，肥料场办起后，学生的学习和劳动都有了具体的安排，解决了学生生活上的实际困难，这样也就消除了家长怕子女上学影响劳动收入的顾虑，使学生更能安心学习。板桥乡乡党委副书记王国强说：现在社员满意，教师满意，学生满意，家长也满意。
    在农业中学办肥料场也曾遇到困难，但教师和学生采取边学、边教、边做的办法克服了困难。第六农业中学的专职教师金志尧买了书籍积极钻研，现在他已为学生上了两堂有关颗粒肥料的制法和好处的课程。第二、第七农业中学组织学生、教师和社员到附近的肥料厂参观学习，然后再在学生中普遍传授。他们还请了供销社的干部为农业中学学生上课和进行业务指导。房屋和设备都由农业社负责帮助解决。现在板桥乡的乡党委正在加强对这四个肥料场的领导。为了使农业中学办好肥料场，乡党委还抽调了第十社的社支书做细菌肥料场的专职场长，并且配备了两个会计。其他三个颗粒肥料场都由社主任或社支书兼场长。这四个肥料场生产的肥料由乡党委统一分配。为了加强对学生的领导，很多社支书都向学生作了报告，在学生中初步树立了做一个亦工亦农的劳动者思想，提高了学生学习工农业生产知识的热情。
