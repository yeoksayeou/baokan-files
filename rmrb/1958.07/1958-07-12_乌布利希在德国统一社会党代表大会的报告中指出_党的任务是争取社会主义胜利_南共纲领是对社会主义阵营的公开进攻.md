Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 10th: Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), delivered a report entitled "Struggle for Peace, for the Victory of Socialism, and for the Revival of Germany as a Peace-Loving Country" on the first day of the Fifth Party Congress on the 10th.

Ulbricht said that the central content of the Fifth Party Congress is to point out to the German working class and all peace-loving people that the most important way to safeguard peace and ensure it is inviolable is to strengthen our country's worker-peasant power and move firmly towards socialism.

After analyzing the current international balance of power, Ulbricht pointed out that the basic political task at present is to carry out the struggle for peace and against atomic death.

Ulbricht then talked about the peace treaty issue. He said that the establishment of a confederation of the two Germanys would be one of the principles of the future German peace treaty. As a sovereign state, Germany should not be bound by any military bloc or economic alliance. The territory of Germany should be determined in accordance with the decisions of the 1945 Potsdam Conference. He emphasized that the government of the German Democratic Republic is ready to discuss the following issues with representatives of the West German Parliament or the Federal Government: not to establish any missile bases in Germany; not to equip the German army with nuclear weapons; and not to allow any aircraft carrying atomic bombs to fly over German territory. He reiterated the proposal for the Warsaw Pact countries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries to sign a treaty of non-aggression.

Ulbricht pointed out that the majority of West German residents have realized that the Adenauer government is trying to use atomic armament to block the road to German reunification. He emphasized that the policy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is incompatible with German unification.

Ulbricht then, on behalf of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, made the following suggestions to the members of the Bonn Bundestag and the residents of West Germany: to openly exchange views on the issue of achieving unification through the mutual rapprochement and establishment of a confederation of the two Germanys; to hold government-level negotiations on various issues related to the two Germanys; and representatives of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party of West Germany to hold negotiations on the issue of establishing a confederation and restoring unification.

Ulbricht pointed out that ordinary members of the West German Social Democratic Party support a policy of peace, while the right-wing leaders of the party support Adenauer's policy. He said that the people's movement in West Germany against atomic death has issued a warning to the leading group of the Social Democratic Party: it must make unbiased contact with the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, otherwise it will be impossible to defeat the atomic armament politicians in West Germany.

When talking about the issue of revisionism, Ulbricht pointed out: "Modern revisionism, which touts itself as national socialism and 'national communism,' is a manifestation of the influence of bourgeois ideology within the workers' movement. ... Revisionism is particularly dangerous in the German Democratic Republic because it hinders overcoming the existing contradictions on the road of socialist development, deepens difficulties, and paves the way for the restoration of capitalism and the subversion of the German Democratic Republic."

Ulbricht then asked, who exactly benefits from the revisionist program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia? He said, "If the leading group of the Yugoslav Communists puts forward a complete program and adopts a principled and erroneous position in its assessment of the international situation and the role of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, then this cannot but be regarded as an open attack on the socialist camp."

Ulbricht then talked about the achievements of socialist construction in the German Democratic Republic, saying that socialist enterprises already accounted for 88.7% of total industrial production in 1957. From 1951 to 1955, industrial production increased to the equivalent of twice the pre-war level. Ulbricht suggested that the main economic goal by 1961 should be to develop the economy of the German Democratic Republic to such an extent within a few years that it unambiguously demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system over West German imperialist rule. The result of this development will enable the working people of the German Democratic Republic to catch up with and surpass West Germany in terms of per capita consumption of all important food and consumer goods. He said that the results of the recent economic talks with the Soviet Union have made it possible for the economy of the German Democratic Republic to achieve further important development. He expressed, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, heartfelt gratitude to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and all the Soviet people.

Ulbricht then mentioned the prospects for industrial development, saying that by 1965, total industrial production would be nearly double that of 1957. During the third five-year plan, the chemical industry will be the focus of development. In addition, two of the most modern power plants will be built in the southern suburbs of Berlin; they will be the largest brown coal-fired power plants in the world; by 1965, at least 750,000 housing units will be built.

Ulbricht said that the continuous increase in the number of agricultural cooperatives and the growth of socialist factors in the countryside are determining the development of the entire agriculture. The production of milk, pork, and eggs may complete or nearly complete the 1960 planned targets this year.

When talking about the socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural fields, Ulbricht put forward ten basic moral principles that a socialist new person should possess, including solidarity with the international working class, helping worker-peasant countries with socialist actions at any time, and supporting all people who are fighting for national liberation and national independence.

In the last part of his report, Ulbricht talked about the further development of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany as a Marxist-Leninist party. He said that the party's historical task is to lead socialism to victory in one part of Germany under the conditions of the worldwide struggle between the two systems of capitalism and socialism. He said, "We must victoriously overcome the signs of stagnation and neutralism; at the same time, strengthen the worker-peasant power and lead the socialist revolution forward through new achievements in industrial and agricultural production and in the scientific field. Thanks to the vigilance of the party and public security departments, we have successfully destroyed counter-revolutionary groups and revisionist programs."

Ulbricht said that the party has learned lessons from the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots. It has adopted many new methods to accomplish its great tasks. In order to further strengthen ties with the masses and promote worker enthusiasm, every member of the party and state personnel must go to work in production and other grass-roots units for a period of time each year.

Ulbricht said that the plan presented to the Fifth Party Congress means that the special and important role of the German Democratic Republic is becoming greater and greater compared to the Bonn state under the rule of the military-clerical group. He said that the important role of the German Democratic Republic is determined by: the speed and achievements of socialist construction, the firm and unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp, and the ties with the working class and progressive forces in West Germany.

    乌布利希在德国统一社会党代表大会的报告中指出
    党的任务是争取社会主义胜利
    南共纲领是对社会主义阵营的公开进攻
    新华社柏林10日电　德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希10日在第五次党代表大会的第一天会议上作了“为和平、为社会主义的胜利、为复兴德国成为一个爱好和平的国家而斗争”的报告。
    乌布利希说，第五次党代表大会的中心内容是要向德国工人阶级和全体爱好和平的人民指明维护和平并且能够保障它不受侵犯，最重要的就是要加强我国的工农政权，并且坚定不移地向社会主义前进。
    在分析了目前国际力量对比的形势之后，乌布利希指出目前的基本政治任务是开展争取和平和反对原子死亡的斗争。
    乌布利希接着谈到和约问题。他说，两个德国成立邦联将是未来的对德和约的原则之一。作为一个主权国家，德国不应该受任何军事集团或经济联盟的约束。德国的领土应该根据1945年波茨坦会议的决议来加以确定。他强调说，民主德国政府准备同西德议会或联邦政府的代表讨论如下问题：不在德国境内建立任何导弹基地；不以核武器装备德国军队；不让任何载有原子弹的飞机在德国领土上空飞行。他重申了有关由华沙条约各国同北大西洋集团各国签订互不侵犯条约的主张。
    乌布利希指出，西德大部分居民已经认识到阿登纳政府是企图用原子武装来堵死德国重新统一的道路。他强调说，北大西洋集团的政策同德国的统一是不相容的。
    接着乌布利希代表德国统一社会党向波恩联邦议院议员和西德居民提出了下列建议：就通过两个德国的互相接近和成立邦联来达到统一的问题公开交换意见；就有关两个德国的各项问题举行政府级谈判；德国统一社会党和西德社会民主党两党的代表就成立邦联和恢复统一问题举行谈判。
    乌布利希指出，西德社会民主党的普通党员支持和平政策，而这个党的右翼领导人却支持阿登纳的政策。他说，西德反对原子死亡的人民运动向社会民主党的领导集团提出了警告：必须同德国统一社会党进行不带成见的接触，否则就不可能击败西德的原子武装政客。
    乌布利希在谈到修正主义问题的时候指出：“以民族社会主义和‘民族共产主义’相标榜的现代修正主义是工人运动内部资产阶级思想影响的一种表现。……修正主义在民主德国所以特别具有危险性，是因为它妨碍克服在社会主义发展道路上现存的矛盾，加深困难，并且替资本主义的复辟和颠复德意志民主共和国铺平道路。”
    乌布利希接着问道，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义纲领究竟对谁有利呢？他说，“如果南共领导集团提出了一个完整的纲领，而在对国际形势以及苏联和社会主义阵营的作用的估价上采取了一种原则错误的立场，那么这不能不被认为是向社会主义阵营的公开进攻。”
    乌布利希接着谈到民主德国的社会主义建设成果说，社会主义企业在1957年的工业总生产中已经占到88.7％的份额。从1951年到1955年期间，工业生产增加到相当于战前的两倍。乌布利希建议说，到1961年为止的主要经济目标应该是：让民主德国的经济在几年之内发展到足以毫不含糊地表明社会主义制度对西德帝国主义统治的优越性。这种发展的结果将使民主德国劳动人民在所有重要食品和消费品的消费量方面按人口平均赶上并超过西德。他说，最近同苏联举行经济会谈的结果，使民主德国的经济有可能获得更进一步的重要发展。他代表德国统一社会党中央委员会向苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联政府和全体苏联人民表示衷心的感谢。
    乌布利希接着提到工业发展的前景说，到1965年时，工业总生产将比1957年增加近一倍。在第三个五年计划期间，化学工业将是发展的重点。另外在柏林南郊还将兴建两座最现代化的发电厂；它们将是世界上规模最大的用褐煤作燃料的发电厂；到1965年为止，至少要建筑住宅七十五万套。
    乌布利希说，农业合作社数量的不断增加和农村中社会主义因素的增长正在决定着整个农业的发展。牛奶、猪肉和鸡蛋的生产量在今年就可能完成或接近完成1960年的计划指标。
    在谈到思想意识和文化领域里的社会主义革命时，乌布利希提出了作为一个社会主义的新人应该具备的十项基本道德准则，其中包括同国际工人阶级团结一致、随时用社会主义的行动来帮助工农国家以及声援一切为争取民族解放和民族独立而斗争的人民。
    在报告的最后一部分，乌布利希谈到德国统一社会党作为一个马列主义政党的进一步发展的问题。他说，党的历史性任务是：在资本主义和社会主义两种制度进行世界范围的斗争的条件下，在德国的一部分把社会主义导向胜利。他说，“我们必须胜利地克服停滞和中立主义的征象；同时通过在工农业生产以及科学领域中取得的新成就来加强工农政权，并且领导社会主义革命向前发展。由于党和公安部门的警觉性，我们已经成功地摧毁了反革命的集团和修正主义的纲领。”
    乌布利希说，党从匈牙利反革命暴乱中吸取了教训。它已经采用了许多新方法来完成它的巨大任务。为了要进一步密切同人民群众的联系和促进工人的积极性，党和国家的每一个工作人员每年都必须到生产中和其他基层工作单位去工作一段时期。
    乌布利希说，向党的第五次代表大会提出的计划意味着德意志民主共和国特殊的重要作用比起军事—教权集团统治下的波恩国家正在变得越来越大。他说，德意志民主共和国的重要作用决定于：社会主义建设的速度和成就，同苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的坚定和牢不可破的友谊以及同西德工人阶级和进步力量的联系。
