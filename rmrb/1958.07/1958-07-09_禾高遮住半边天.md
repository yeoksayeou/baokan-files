    Tall Rice Plants Blocking Half the Sky
    In the experimental plot of the Shao Ban Township cadres,
    Villagers enter and disappear from sight,
    Is it perhaps intentional hide-and-seek?
    Hey! The tall rice plants are blocking half the sky.
    Praised by a hundred, spread by a thousand,
    An eighty-year-old marvels at its rarity,
    A blind man in spring opens his eyes,
    Eagerly guessing how many thousand *jin* per *mu* will be harvested.
                (Xia Yan)

    禾高遮住半边天
    邵坂乡干部试验田，
    社员进去人不见，
    莫非有意捉迷藏，
    嘿！禾高遮住半边天。
    百人颂，千人传，
    八十岁老人夸少见，
    春天的瞎子开了眼，
    争猜一亩收几千（斤）。
                （夏炎）
