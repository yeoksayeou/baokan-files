Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 5th: The state-owned Tianjin Radio Factory has recently successfully trial-produced an AC stepless variable speed motor. This groundbreaking achievement will bring about significant changes in the manufacturing of transmission equipment.

Ordinary motors cannot change speed; they can only rotate at their fixed speed. However, many mechanical equipment such as machine tools often require speed changes. In the past, this contradiction was resolved by using stepped mechanical speed change devices. The AC stepless variable speed motor can be changed to any speed within its maximum rotational speed range. The widespread adoption of this motor will eliminate the need to manufacture complex speed change equipment when manufacturing various machine tools and some other mechanical equipment that requires speed changes. Replacing mechanical speed change with stepless variable speed motors is not only easier to control, but also reduces the manufacturing cost of products, saving a significant amount of man-hours and metal materials.

The first AC stepless variable speed motor manufactured by the Tianjin Radio Factory has a maximum speed of 1,620 revolutions per minute. According to tests, both the speed change and operation are very good. Currently, the workers are preparing to further research and improve the quality of this motor, so that it can reach a maximum of 2,400 revolutions per minute, and gradually establish complete technical data to prepare for the future production of various horsepower stepless variable speed motors.

    天津制成交流无级变速马达
    传动设备的制造将发生重大变化
    新华社天津5日电　国营天津无线电厂最近试制成功交流无级变速马达。这项创举将引起传动设备制造方面的重大变化。
    普通马达不能变速，本身是多少转就只能转多少转，而各种机床等许多机械设备又必须经常变换速度。这个矛盾，以往是依靠有级的机械变速装置来解决的。交流无级变速马达，可以在它能达到的最高转速范围内，要多少转就能变换成多少转。广泛采用这种马达，就可以在制造各种机床和部分需要变速的其他机械设备时，不用再制造复杂的变速设备。用无级变速马达代替机械变速，不仅控制方便，而且会使产品的制造成本下降，节省出大量的工时和金属材料。
    天津无线电厂制的第一台交流无级变速马达，每分钟的转数最高是一千六百二十转。据试验，变速与运转情况都很好。现在，工人们准备进一步研究改进这种马达的质量，使它每分钟最高能转二千四百转，并逐步建立一些完整的技术资料，为今后生产各种马力的无级变速马达准备条件。
