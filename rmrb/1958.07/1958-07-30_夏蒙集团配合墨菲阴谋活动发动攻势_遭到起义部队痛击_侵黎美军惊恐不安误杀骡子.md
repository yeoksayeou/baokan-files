Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 29th: Reports from Beirut: The tottering Chamoun Group has once again intensified its military offensive against the rebels, attempting to exert pressure on them in coordination with the "presidential election" conspiracy being carried out by U.S. "envoy" Murphy in Lebanon.

It is reported that on the morning of the 28th, Chamoun sent armed fascistic National Social Party members to launch an attack on the rebel-controlled "Tailor's Hill," attempting to force the rebels to withdraw from this highest point in Beirut. The rebels resolutely fought back. From their elevated position, they drove the Chamoun party members, who were attempting to climb the hill, into headlong flight. Two days prior, the rebels had repelled an attack by Chamoun's security forces. It is reported that approximately twelve people were killed or injured in yesterday's fierce fighting.

In addition, near the Capital Hotel in the southern part of the Basta district of Beirut, rebels also engaged in a brief firefight with Chamoun's security forces.

Near Tripoli, Lebanon's second largest city, rebels engaged in fierce fighting with Chamoun's party members. It is said that at least thirty people died.

Early this morning, as Prime Minister Solh of the Chamoun regime was traveling by car from his residence outside Beirut to the city, a pre-planted bomb exploded very close to his car, but did not hit it.

Xinhua News Agency, 29th: A United Press International dispatch from Beirut on the 28th ridiculed the farcical incident of a group of invading U.S. troops in Lebanon, in a state of extreme panic, mistaking a mule for Lebanese rebels and shooting it. The reporter sarcastically said that these guilty and cowardly American soldiers shot the mule – "the finest marksmanship in the pitch-black night."

The reporter wrote that the shooting of the mule by American soldiers "is different from the jokes circulating in the army about sentries mistakenly shooting farm animals. The shooting of the mule demonstrates the difficulties faced by the Marines guarding Beirut International Airport and their high state of tension." It is remembered that these American invading soldiers, who intruded into another country's territory, have committed more than just this one foolish act due to being in a state of "high tension." Some time ago, they mistakenly shot and killed their own people, believing them to be rebels, and they also randomly opened fire on Chamoun's police.

Another United Press International reporter reported on the 28th that the U.S. Army airborne troops invading Lebanon were prepared to move into positions around Beirut International Airport on the same day to take over the defense, "a welcome move by the Marines" originally stationed there. It is reported that these U.S. Marines, fearing attacks by the local rebel people, had been "unable to sleep for several nights in a row and could only sleep for three or four hours during the hot daytime sun."

    夏蒙集团配合墨菲阴谋活动发动攻势
    遭到起义部队痛击
    侵黎美军惊恐不安误杀骡子
    新华社29日讯　贝鲁特消息：摇摇欲坠的夏蒙集团又开始加强对起义者发动军事进攻，企图配合美国“特使”墨菲正在黎巴嫩进行的“总统选举”阴谋，对起义者施加压力。
    据报道，夏蒙28日上午派了武装的法西斯国家社会党徒向起义者控制的“裁缝山”发动进攻，企图迫使起义者退出这个贝鲁特最高的山头。起义者进行了坚决的回击。他们居高临下地把企图爬上山头的夏蒙党徒打得抱头鼠窜。起义者在这以前两天，就曾经击退了夏蒙保安队的一次进攻。据报道，在昨天的激战中，约有十二人死伤。
    另外在贝鲁特的巴斯塔区南端的首都饭店附近，起义者也同夏蒙的保安队发生了短时间的激战。
    在黎巴嫩第二大城的黎波里附近，起义者同夏蒙的党徒发生了激烈战斗。据说至少有三十人死亡。
    今天清早，夏蒙政权的总理索勒哈在坐着汽车从贝鲁特市外的住所到市内去的路上，一颗预先安放好的炸弹在离他的汽车很近的地方爆炸了，但是没有炸中他的汽车。
    据新华社29日讯　合众国际社记者28日从贝鲁特发出的一条消息，嘲笑了一批侵黎美军在极度慌恐中误把骡子当作黎巴嫩起义者而射杀的笑闻。这位记者挖苦这些心亏胆怯的美国兵说，他们开枪打死骡子——这“是漆黑的夜色里最高明的射击术”。
    这位记者写道，美国兵开枪打骡子，“跟军队中流行的同开枪误击农畜的哨兵开玩笑不同。开枪打骡子的事情表明警卫贝鲁特国际机场的海军陆战队的困难和他们的高度紧张状态。”人们记得，这些闯入他国领土的美国侵略军士兵由于“高度紧张”而干出的蠢事并不止这一件。前些时候，他们就曾经把自己的人当做起义者而开枪打死，还曾经向夏蒙警察胡乱开枪射击。
    合众国际社的另一位记者在28日报道说，侵黎美国陆军空运部队已经准备在当天开入贝鲁特国际机场周围阵地去接防，这是原来驻在那里的“海军陆战队所欢迎的行动”。据报道，这批美国海军陆战队士兵由于害怕当地起义人民的攻击，已经“接连好几个晚上都没有睡觉，而只能够在白天烈日之下睡上三、四个钟点。”
