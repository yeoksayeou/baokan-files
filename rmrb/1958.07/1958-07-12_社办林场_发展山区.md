Commune-run Forest Farms Develop Mountainous Areas
Zhang Shaoliang, Secretary of the Huangmei County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hubei Province

Huangmei County is located on the southern foothills of the Dabie Mountains and the northern bank of the Yangtze River. The county has ten mountainous townships (accounting for 29% of the total number of townships), twenty hilly townships (accounting for 36% of the total number of townships), and four hundred and nineteen agricultural cooperatives in mountainous and hilly areas (accounting for 48.6% of the county's total number of cooperatives). Each laborer in the county is responsible for less than five mu of land, and each person has an average of only 1.62 mu of cultivated land. In the Dashan township of Xiangcai, Dagu, and Wangjiang, each person has only about 0.8 mu of cultivated land. Relying solely on developing agricultural production to increase the income of commune members is ultimately limited. It is necessary to develop the wealth of mountainous areas and carry out diversified operations such as forestry, animal husbandry, and specialty production. Although there has been some development in forestry production in recent years, the leadership is not strong, there are no grassroots forestry organizations, and forestry work cannot be regularized. Although some places have professional teams, they are all drawn away during the busy farming season, leaving forestry unattended. Although many trees have been planted in recent years, not many have matured. As a result, a small number of mountain residents are not content with mountain production and want to move to the plains.

Establish "Three Farms," Create "Five Forests"

Last year, according to the spirit of the Central Mountain Area Production Forum, the county committee fully discussed mountain area production, clarified the direction of mountain area work, promptly established full-time institutions, and strengthened the leadership of diversified operations such as forestry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and specialty production in mountainous and hilly areas. At the same time, it proposed a 1958-1962 mountain area production plan, and set the goal for 1958 to achieve "gardens full of seedlings, mountains full of trees, diversified operations doubled, grain production striving for a thousand catties, and an income of one hundred yuan per person." This plan inspired the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses in the mountainous areas and established confidence in building a socialist mountainous area.

How to lead the people in mountainous areas to develop mountain production in an organized and planned way? After exploring Xiangcai township, a key area in the mountains, last winter, the county committee decided to promote the establishment of "three farms" (forest farms, livestock farms, and handicraft processing plants) and the creation of "five forests" (timber forests, bamboo forests, oil forests, economic forests, and fruit tree forests) in all communes throughout the county, adhering to the principle of focusing on forestry and developing diversified operations. The county committee summarized the experience of the Yong'an commune's Yong'an cooperative in running a forest farm, and helped the Wuxing No. 2 cooperative in Tingqian township and the Shiyue cooperative in Xiangcai township trial run forest farms on the basis of professional teams. It also promptly organized visits and summaries through on-site meetings to mobilize cooperatives to run forest farms.

Since last winter, 168 commune-run forest farms have been developed throughout the county, drawing a total of 1,225 long-term fixed laborers, and mobilizing the masses to invest 91,800 yuan, managing about 175,000 mu of mountain forest area. Under the premise of focusing on forestry, intercropping of agriculture and forestry is implemented, with an area of 3,380 mu, and 1,755 mu of wasteland is reclaimed by forest farms (using gentle slopes). At the same time, taking full advantage of the superior conditions of the "three farms," we seized the opportunity of the large-scale afforestation movement last winter and this spring, and launched a high tide of construction in mountainous areas. The forest farms played a central organizational role in the greening movement, leading the broad masses to overfulfill the afforestation tasks. The county afforested more than 118,000 mu last winter and this spring, exceeding the assigned task by more than three times, which is equivalent to more than 120% of the total afforestation task during the first five-year plan period, and the barren hills in the county have been basically eliminated. In the afforestation movement, the cadres and the masses were highly motivated and enthusiastic. Many forest farms planted trees during the day and reclaimed wasteland at night. The masses said: "The leadership of the Party is truly strong, there are real ways to improve our lives, the establishment of the five forests and three farms means we will never suffer famine again." They also proposed: "Every mountain must be dressed up, every stream must irrigate the fields, every piece of soil must be utilized, and every piece of land must produce high yields." Each township, each cooperative, and each farm has formulated its own long-term plan. Xiang Zhuxuan, who had applied five times to move down the mountain, no longer wants to leave the mountains.

Many Benefits of Commune-run Forest Farms

Based on our preliminary experience, commune-run forest farms have many benefits for developing mountain production with forestry as the mainstay.

First, commune-run forest farms are a good way to rely on the masses to develop forestry production. For managing small plots of mountain land, it is more convenient than state-run forest farms.

Commune forest farms do not require the state to provide money. Most of the houses are renovated from old ones, production tools are adjusted by the commune, and household utensils are brought by commune members themselves, which costs less money and gets things done well. For example, the Wuxing No. 3 cooperative in Tingqian only spent 6.5 yuan to set up a forest farm. Another example is the Shiyue cooperative forest farm, which implemented the "five self" method of "self-collecting seeds, self-cultivating seedlings, self-planting trees, self-finding dead wood, and self-grafting," which not only solved the difficulties of lacking seedlings and seeds, but also saved a large amount of funds.

The commune-run forest farm is a production unit directly under the leadership of the Party branch and the commune management committee. The deputy director of the commune or the deputy secretary of the branch serves as the director of the forest farm, making it easy to solve problems in a timely manner.

The commune-run forest farm is a unified operation with the agricultural cooperative, and implements the principle of "payment according to labor, more work, more pay" in the distribution of income, so that the production of the forest farm is closely related to the lives of the commune members, and the enthusiasm of those who run the forest farm is very high.

The commune-run forest farm is a professional grassroots forestry organization with separate production plans and various systems, and can carry out production in a planned and organized manner, overcoming the phenomenon of "planting trees with a bang, drawing them all away during the busy farming season, guaranteeing planting but not survival, and no one caring about life or death" in the past.

Second, judging from the afforestation situation in our county last winter and this spring, each district, township, cooperative, and farm has followed the national plan, focusing on timber forests and correspondingly creating various economic forests, and overfulfilled the various afforestation tasks. At the same time, the forest farm can also actively carry out diversified operations, develop animal husbandry and specialty products, and can also make full use of the land for agroforestry intercropping, solving the contradiction between long-term and immediate interests, and achieving self-sufficiency and more. Among the 168 forest farms that have been established in our county, except for nine farms in the deep mountains that specialize in forestry production, the rest of the forest farms are mixed farms that include forestry, agriculture, specialty products, animal husbandry, and handicrafts. In this way, the forest farm has the conditions to achieve self-sufficiency and more. For example, the Yong'an commune's Yong'an cooperative forest farm implemented agroforestry intercropping in 1957 and achieved two harvests. It not only created and cultivated 4,600 mu of pine, fir, and nan bamboo, 210 mu of oil tea and tung oil trees, and 2,300 pear and peach trees, but also intercropped rice, wheat, peas, potatoes, and sweet potatoes in the forest rows, with an income equivalent to more than 39,000 catties of grain, and 13,000 catties of peanuts and sesame seeds, achieving self-sufficiency and more.

Third, with professional forest farms for professional production, it is possible to achieve self-collecting seeds, self-cultivating seedlings, and self-planting. At the same time, due to a relatively complete management system, the quality of forestry production can be guaranteed, the survival rate of trees can be improved, and the speed of greening can be accelerated, changing the past tendency of "afforestation with a bang, no one caring after planting," and "planting trees every year, but not seeing a forest form." When Xiangcai township transplanted nan bamboo last winter, many cooperatives had quotas, contracts, and rewards. Therefore, the survival rate of nan bamboo transplanted in our county last winter was almost 100%. The survival rate of afforestation last winter and this spring generally reached about 90%. Currently, we are carrying out cultivation and fertilization of newly planted young forests, which was rare in the past.

Fourth, with commune-run forest farms, forestry production can be arranged in a planned way, effectively solving many contradictions in forestry production: (1) Because the forest farm arranges and fixes the labor required for forestry, it solves the labor contradiction between agricultural and forestry production in the past. (2) With commune-run forest farms, each cooperative has comprehensively planned the mountains and forests, rationally delineated pastures, and solved the contradiction between afforestation and livestock grazing. For example, animal husbandry supports the fertilizer needed for forestry production, and forestry production can support the feed needed for animal husbandry. (3) With commune-run forest farms, there are plans for afforestation, forest cultivation, and felling, and mountain forest management systems have been established and improved, implementing reasonable felling and improving the utilization rate of wood, basically stopping the phenomenon of indiscriminate logging.

Fifth, commune-run forest farms are concentrated production and concentrated living, which is conducive to strengthening the political and ideological education and cultural and technical education of commune members. In the past, training technicians did not have fixed personnel, and forestry technology was not easy to take root among the masses. Now, the forest farm has full-time technicians who, after learning new technologies, pass them on to the forest farm members. Now, the average farm has five, seven, or eight technicians who can collect seeds, cultivate seedlings, graft, and nurture. Some communes have also set up forestry technical night schools.

    社办林场　发展山区
    中共湖北省黄梅县委书记　张绍良
    黄梅县位于大别山之南麓，长江之北岸，全县共有十个山区乡（占总乡数29％）、二十个丘陵乡（占总乡数36％），山区丘陵区有四百一十九个农业社（占全县总社数48.6％），全县每个劳动力负担不到五亩地，每人平均只有耕地一点六二亩，而大山乡向蔡、大古、望江，每人只有耕地零点八亩左右。光靠发展农业生产来增加社员收入，毕竟是有限的，必须开发山区财富，开展林、牧、特多种经营生产。近年来在林业生产上虽有所发展，但领导不强，没有林业基层组织，不能把林业工作经常化。有些地方虽然有了专业队，平时进行林业生产，在农忙时也抽光了，形成林业无人问。近年来造林虽不少，但成林不多。因而少数山区居民不安心于山区生产，想下平原。
    办“三场”，造“五林”
    去年，根据中央山区生产座谈会精神，县委对山区生产作了充分讨论，明确了山区工作的方向，及时建立了专职机构，加强了对山区和丘陵地区的林、农、牧、特等多种经营生产的领导。同时，提出了1958年到1962年山区生产规划，并提出1958年要做到“苗（树苗）满园、树满山，多种经营翻一番，粮食争千斤，每人收入一百元”的奋斗目标。这一规划鼓舞了山区干群的干劲，树立了建设社会主义山区的信心。
    如何领导山区人民有组织有计划地发展山区生产呢？经过去冬在山区重点向蔡乡摸索，县委决定，在全县范围内提倡社社办“三场”（林场、畜牧场、手工业加工场）、造“五林”（用材林、竹林、油林、经济林、果木林），坚持以林业为主，发展多种经营的方针。县委总结了永安乡永安社社办林场的经验，又帮助停前乡五星二社和向蔡乡十月社在专业队基础上试办林场，并及时通过现场会进行参观总结，动员合作社办林场。
    自去冬以来，全县社办林场已发展一百六十八个，共抽出长期固定劳动力一千二百二十五人，并发动群众投资九万一千八百元，经营山林面积约十七万五千亩。在以林为主的前提下，实行农林间作，计农林间作面积达三千三百八十亩，林场开荒一千七百五十五亩（利用平坡开荒）。与此同时，充分利用“三场”的优越条件，紧紧抓住去冬今春大搞造林运动，掀起了建设山区高潮。林场在绿化运动中起到了组织核心作用，带领广大群众超额完成了造林任务。全县去冬今春共造林十一万八千多亩，超额完成了上级分配任务的三倍多，相当于第一个五年计划期间造林任务总和的120％强，全县荒山基本消灭。在造林运动中，干群干劲大、热情高。不少林场白天造林，晚上开荒。群众说：党的领导真正强，改善生活真有方，建立五林和三场，今后再不受饥荒。并提出：是山都要打扮，是水都要灌田，是土都要利用，是地都要高产。各乡、各社、各场均制订了自己的远景规划。向蔡乡提出“遍洼皆楠竹，远山用材林，近山果木密，平坡油茶林，社社办林场，牛羊成万群。”过去申请五次一心想搬下山住的向竹轩，现在不想下山了。
    社办林场好处很多
    根据我们的初步体会：社办林场对发展以林业为主的山区生产有很多好处。
    第一，社办林场是依靠群众发展林业生产的良好形式。就经营小块山地来说，它比国营林场更方便。
    社林场不要国家拿钱。大部分房屋以旧整新，生产工具由社调剂，生活用具由社员自带，花钱少，办事好。如停前五星三社，只花六元五角钱就办起了一个林场。又如十月社林场实行“自采种、自育苗、自造林、自找枯木、自嫁接”的“五自”办法，不仅解决了缺苗、缺子困难，而且节省了大批资金。
    社办林场是在党支部和社管委会直接领导下的生产单位。由社的副主任或支部副书记担任林场场长，遇到问题易于及时解决。
    社办林场是与农业社统一经营，在收益分配上贯彻“按劳取酬，多劳多得”的原则，这样就使林场生产与社员生活息息相关，经营林场的人的积极性很高。
    社办林场是专业性的林业基层组织，有单独生产规划及各种制度，能有计划、有安排的去进行生产，克服过去那种“造林轰一阵，农忙抽光尽，保栽不保活，死活无人问”的现象。
    第二，从我县去冬今春造林情况来看，各区、乡、社、场都是按照国家计划，以用材林为主，相应地营造了各种经济林，超额完成了各项造林任务。同时，林场又能积极开展多种经营，发展牧业、特产，也能充分利用土地，进行农林间作，解决了长远利益与眼前利益的矛盾，做到以短养长。我县已办起的一百六十八个林场中，除大深山九个场专门搞林业生产外，其余林场都是包括林业、农业、特产以及畜牧、手工业的混合场。这样，林场就有条件做到自给有余。如永安乡永安社林场在1957年实行林农间作，获得了两丰收，不但营造和培育好四千六百亩松、杉、楠竹，二百一十亩的油茶、油桐和二千三百株梨桃，而且在林行内间作的农作物有米麦、豌豆和洋芋、红苕，收入折粮三万九千多斤，花生、芝麻一万三千斤，做到自给有余。
    第三，有了专业林场，进行专业生产，就能做到自采种、自育苗、自栽植。同时由于有了一套较完整的管理制度，又能保证林业生产质量，提高了林木成活率，加快了绿化速度，改变了过去“造林轰一阵，造后无人问”、“年年栽树，不见成林”的偏向。向蔡乡去冬移栽楠竹的时候，有不少的社都做到有定额有包工有奖励。所以我县去年冬季移栽楠竹成活率几乎达百分之百。去冬今春造林成活率一般达90％左右。目前正在对新造幼林进行中耕施肥工作，这是过去少见的。
    第四，有了社办林场，有计划地安排林业生产，有效地解决了林业生产上的许多矛盾：（1）由于林场安排和固定林业所需要劳力，解决了以往农林生产上的劳力矛盾。（2）有了社办林场，各社对山林进行了全面规划，合理地划出了牧场，解决了造林与牲畜放牧的矛盾。如畜牧支援林业生产所需要的肥料，而林业生产又可以支援畜牧所需要的饲料。（3）有了社办林场，有了造林、育林和砍伐的计划，建立与健全了山林管理制度，实行合理采伐，提高了木材利用率，基本制止了滥砍滥伐现象。
    第五、社办林场是集中生产，集中生活，便于加强对社员的政治思想教育和文化技术教育。过去训练技术员，没有固定的人，林业技术不易在群众中扎根。现在林场有专职技术员，他们学到新技术后，又传授给林场社员。现在一般的场有五、七、八名技术员，会采种育苗嫁接培育。还有些社办了林业技术夜校。
