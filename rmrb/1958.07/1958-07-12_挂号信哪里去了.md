    Where Did the Registered Letter Go?
    My colleague, Li Yongxin, went to Zhengzhou on business and stayed at the Zhengzhou CCP Henan Provincial Committee Reception Department. On April 13th, he wrote asking us to send his salary there. On April 17th, I sent him 100 yuan in salary via registered mail from the Zhangzhidong Road post office in Wuchang. However, on April 30th, we received another letter from Li Yongxin urging us to send his salary. We found it very strange at the time; how could it not have arrived after more than ten days? I immediately went to the post office where I had sent the letter and paid 2 jiao for an inquiry to track it down. On May 9th, we received a reply to the inquiry, stamped with the seal of the "Zhengzhou CCP Henan Provincial Committee Reception Department," stating that it had been received without error.
    However, by the end of May, Li Yongxin returned from Zhengzhou after completing his work assignment, and he still had not received the letter. What exactly happened? We have yet to receive a response from the Zhengzhou CCP Henan Provincial Committee Reception Department.

    挂号信哪里去了
    我校李永新同志因事去郑州，住郑州中共河南省委招待科。4月13日他来信要求把工资寄去。4月17日我在武昌张之洞路邮亭用挂号信给他汇去工资一百元。但是4月30日又收到李永新同志来信催寄工资。当时我们觉得很奇怪，怎么十多天了，还没收到呢？我随即跑到发信的邮亭，花了两角查询费，追询此信。5月9日收到查询回执，上边盖有“中共河南省委招待科”的章子，说已经收到无错。
    但到5月底，李永新同志完成工作任务由郑州回来，还没收到这封信。事情到底如何？我们至今还没有得到中共河南省委招待科的答复。
