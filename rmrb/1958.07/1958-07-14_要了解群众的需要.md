From the perspective of an enterprise, the chief engineer is undoubtedly the most knowledgeable, experienced, and highest-ranking technical authority. However, if he does not actively connect with the masses, understand their needs, and believe in their practical creativity, then he will be like a silkworm, trapped in the silk cocoon it spins, and will end up achieving nothing technically. Conversely, a cadre who was initially an outsider and still doesn't have much technical knowledge, but lives among the masses and considers their needs in everything he does, can discover problems from practice and boldly innovate technology to solve them.

The dispute between Yan Qijia, who came from a farmhand background, and the chief engineer stems from two different starting points: one starts from meeting the needs of the masses, and the other from existing technical formulas and procedures. Their attitudes towards problems also differ. The former, regardless of whether the technology is outdated, as long as it adapts to the current conditions and meets the needs of the masses, actively tries to develop it on the existing foundation, using simple means to solve problems that used to require a lot of money with very little money, and is welcomed by the masses. The latter, however, emphasizes that this technology is outdated, that technology is not the direction of development, passively nitpicking that this is unsafe and that does not meet quality requirements, and even goes so far as to disregard the already successful facts.

The key lies in where you start. If you start from the needs of the masses, the direction is correct, even if you have little knowledge, you will contribute to socialist construction.

Historically, many inventions and creations have come from people with little knowledge, poor conditions, and low status. Today, this newspaper publishes the story of Yan Qijia, a carpenter-turned-post and telecommunications director, and Cheng Ruiqing, a mechanic, who together used the principle of "phantom lines" to successfully enable telephone and radio broadcasting to operate simultaneously on one line, proving that following the mass line is always the correct path to technological innovation. Otherwise, if you are divorced from the masses, no matter how great a technical authority you were in the past, you will not have much effect.

    要了解群众的需要
    鄂文
    从一个企业来讲，总工程师无疑是学问最大、阅历最丰富和职务最高的技术权威。但如果他不积极地联系群众，不了解群众的需要，不相信群众在实践中的创造，那末他也就会像蚕子一样，被自己吐出的丝茧网了起来，结果在技术上就无所作为。相反，一个最初是外行而现在的技术知识也不多的干部，他生活在群众之中，并处处从群众的需要考虑问题，结果，他就能从实际中发现问题，大胆地革新技术解决问题。
    长工出身的严齐家同总工程师之间的争执，就是发生在两个不同的出发点上。一个从满足群众的需要出发，一个从现成的技术公式和技术规程出发。对问题的态度也有所不同。前者不管这个技术是否过时，只要适应当前的条件，满足群众的需要，他就积极地设法在旧有基础上加以发展，因陋就简地用很少的钱解决了过去要用很多的钱才能解决的问题，受到群众的欢迎。后者却强调这个技术过时，那个技术不是发展方向，消极地挑剔这不安全，那不合质量要求，甚至发展到漠视已经成功的事实。
    关键在于从哪里出发。如果从群众需要出发，方向对了，哪怕学问再少，他也会对社会主义建设作出贡献。
    历史上有许多创造发明大都出自学问少、条件差和地位低的人们之手。今天本报发表的木工出身的邮电局长严齐家和机务员程瑞卿一起，利用“幻线”的原理，成功地作到了在一条线路上使电话与广播同时开放，证明走群众路线永远是革新技术的正确道路，否则，脱离群众，尽管过去是多么大的技术权威，也不会起多大的作用。
