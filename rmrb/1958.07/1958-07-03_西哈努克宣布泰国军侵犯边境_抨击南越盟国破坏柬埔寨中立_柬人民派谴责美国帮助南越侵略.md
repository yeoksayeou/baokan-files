Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 2nd: Prince Sihanouk announced in a broadcast on July 1st that Thai troops invaded the Cambodian border on the morning of July 1st. He said that Thailand invaded Cambodian territory in Siem Reap province by about three kilometers, where gunshots were heard.

Sihanouk also once again condemned the South Vietnamese army for invading Cambodian territory. He said that the South Vietnamese invasion was a trick.

Sihanouk said that he was willing to go to Saigon and Bangkok to negotiate directly with the Thai Prime Minister and Ngo Dinh Diem on the relations between their respective countries. He said that through these talks, each side would be able to thoroughly understand the other's opinions, thereby achieving good results.

He criticized the so-called "free world" for attempting to undermine Cambodia's neutral policy. He said that South Vietnam's allies in the "free world" sided with South Vietnam, spoke up for it, and blamed us, in order to break our neutral policy. Sihanouk said that the "free world" accused Cambodia of causing trouble, preventing its neighbors from obtaining peace and security. Sihanouk said, "We must declare to the world that our country has no such intention, and all we want is peace and security and to live in friendship with our neighbors."

Speaking of implementing the neutral policy, Sihanouk said, we have adhered to our neutral policy for three years and won the admiration of distant countries. We do not join any side, nor do we favor Eastern or Western countries. All we want is peace and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. But what does this mean for us? When we are invaded and ask friendly countries for help, no country answers us. Large countries like India do not need allies to pursue their neutral policy, but small countries like us cannot even survive without some allies. Sihanouk asked all Cambodians, including monks, to offer him suggestions on how to pursue a neutral policy.

Sihanouk did not directly answer the question of whether he was willing to serve as Prime Minister, but he expressed his gratitude to the people for entrusting the fate of the country to him.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 2nd: The Phnom Penh "People's Daily" reported on July 1st that the Cambodian People's Party issued a declaration strongly condemning South Vietnam's invasion and expressing support for the statements of the King and Prince Sihanouk, to fight against imperialist aggression and defend the neutral policy until final victory.

The declaration pointed out that South Vietnam's invasion of Cambodian territory was funded and armed by the United States and is part of the aggressive war conspiracy of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The declaration condemned South Vietnam's invasion of Cambodian territory, undermining Cambodia's peace and neutrality. The declaration said that the South Vietnamese authorities, especially the United States, which supports South Vietnam with money, weapons, and military advisors, must be condemned by the people of Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos.

    西哈努克宣布泰国军侵犯边境
    抨击南越盟国破坏柬埔寨中立
    柬人民派谴责美国帮助南越侵略
    新华社金边2日电　西哈努克亲王7月1日广播说，泰国军队在7月1日早上侵犯了柬埔寨边境。他说，泰国侵入柬埔寨暹粒省的领土约三公里，在那里听到了枪声。
    西哈努克还再一次谴责南越军队侵犯柬埔寨领土。他说，南越的入侵是一个诡计。
    西哈努克说，他愿意前往西贡和曼谷直接同泰国总理和吴庭艳就他们各国之间的关系进行谈判。他说，通过这些会谈每一方都能够彻底了解另一方的意见，从而获得良好的结果。
    他抨击所谓“自由世界”企图破坏柬埔寨的中立政策。他说，南越在“自由世界”的盟国偏袒南越，帮它说话，而怨屈我们，以便打破我们的中立政策。西哈努克说，“自由世界”责难柬埔寨惹是生非，使它的邻国得不到和平和安全。西哈努克说，我们必须向全世界宣告，我们的国家没有这种意图，我们所希望的只是和平和安全以及同我们的邻国友好相处。
    西哈努克在谈到执行中立政策时说，我们坚持我们的中立政策已经有三年，赢得了遥远的国家的钦佩。我们不参加任何一方，也不偏袒东方国家或西方国家。我们要的只是和平以及和平共处五项原则。但是对我们说来这意味着什么呢？当我们遭到侵犯而向友好国家要求帮助时，没有国家回答我们。像印度这样的大国不需要盟国就能够奉行它的中立政策，但是像我们这样的小国如果没有一些盟国甚至都无法生存。西哈努克要求全体柬埔寨人，包括僧侣在内，向他提出应该如何奉行中立政策的建议。
    西哈努克没有直接答复他是否愿意出任首相的问题，但是他表示感谢人民把国家的命运托付给他。
    新华社金边2日电　金边“人民报”1日报道，柬埔寨人民派发表了一个宣言，强烈谴责南越的入侵行动，并且表示支持国王和西哈努克亲王的声明，为反对帝国主义侵略和维护中立政策直到最后胜利而进行斗争。
    宣言指出，南越侵犯柬埔寨领土是由美国资助和武装的，这是东南亚条约组织的侵略战争阴谋的一部分。宣言谴责南越侵入柬埔寨领土，破坏柬埔寨的和平和中立。宣言说，南越当局，尤其是以金钱、武器和军事顾问支持南越的美国，必须受到柬埔寨、越南和老挝人民的谴责。
