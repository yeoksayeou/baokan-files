Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi said tonight at the reception celebrating the 14th anniversary of Polish National Rebirth Day: The Chinese people once again warn the US-British aggressors that if they do not stop their acts of aggression, the 600 million Chinese people and peace-loving countries and people around the world will never stand idly by.

Chen Yi said: We firmly believe that the US-British imperialist aggression plan will be shamefully defeated; the just struggle of the Arab people will surely be victorious.

The grand reception was held by Polish Chargé d'Affaires to China, Mr. Frątczak. Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, and Vice Chairman Li Jishen also attended the reception. In his speech, Frątczak announced to his six hundred guests—people from all walks of life in China and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China—that Poland sternly and resolutely condemns the US intervention in Lebanon and the British intervention in Jordan, Poland was one of the first countries to recognize the Republic of Iraq and supports the national revolutionary movements in Arab countries.

These words of Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi and Chargé d'Affaires Frątczak won prolonged applause from Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception.

In their speeches, the hosts and guests also talked about the amazing achievements Poland has made in the past fourteen years and the deepening friendship between China and Poland. Chen Yi said: Socialist Poland is an important force for peace. It has consistently fought for the maintenance of peace in Europe and the world, and has made valuable contributions. The Chinese people are happy about the great achievements of the Polish people and look forward to the Polish people achieving new and greater victories in the cause of socialist construction. He said: The relations of unity and mutual assistance between China and Poland have been developing smoothly. We are even more satisfied with the leap forward in economic cooperation between our two countries this year. The Polish people can be confident that the Chinese people will work to further enhance the friendly cooperation between our two countries. He said: Strengthening the unity between the Chinese and Polish people is conducive to the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. This unity is a strong guarantee for the smooth socialist construction and the maintenance of world peace for all countries in our camp. Precisely because of this, the imperialists and modern revisionists particularly hate and try their best to undermine this unity. It is only natural that they are angered by Comrade Gomułka’s recent speech in Gdańsk, in which he emphasized the unity of the socialist camp, condemned modern revisionism, and supported Hungary's execution of the traitor Nagy.

Frątczak said that in the past fourteen years, Poland has transformed from an agricultural and economically backward country into an industrial country with great development prospects. Poland's industrial output has now reached five times that of 1938 and will reach ten times the pre-war level in the next seven years. The Polish United Workers' Party is leading the Polish people to realize the great socialist tasks. People's Poland is no longer isolated. It belongs to the big family of socialist countries together with the first, oldest, and most powerful socialist country, the Soviet Union, great China, and other people's democratic countries. The friendship and fraternal cooperation between People's Poland and these countries is growing day by day. This friendship and alliance of socialist countries, based on the common Marxist-Leninist ideology and the common peaceful goals of the entire socialist camp, is unbreakable. The friendship and fraternal cooperation between China and Poland is constantly strengthening. The Polish people follow with admiration the great achievements of the Chinese people in the cause of socialist construction.

Frątczak said: Our people, who have experienced the tragedy of war, oppose all attempts to sharpen the international situation in international politics, especially the revival of German militarism, which has brought such great suffering to mankind. Therefore, Poland has put forward the "Rapacki Plan"—a plan to establish a nuclear-free zone in Europe—and supports all initiatives aimed at easing international tensions. In order to save mankind from the threat of atomic war, to defend peace, for peaceful coexistence and the happiness of all mankind, Poland yearns for the cooperation of people all over the world.

The grand reception lasted for nearly two hours.

    波兰临时代办举行盛大招待会
    庆祝波兰国家复兴节十四周年
    新华社22日讯  陈毅副总理兼外交部长今晚在庆祝波兰国家复兴节十四周年招待会上的讲话中说：中国人民再一次警告美英侵略者，如果再不停止侵略行为，六亿中国人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民绝不会袖手旁观。
    陈毅说：我们坚信：美英帝国主义的侵略计划必将遭到可耻的失败；阿拉伯人民的正义斗争必然获得胜利。
    盛大的招待会是波兰驻中国大使馆临时代办傅拉托举行的，李先念、薄一波副总理，李济深副委员长也出席了招待会。傅拉托在讲话中向他的六百多位客人——中国各方面的人士和各国驻华使节——宣布：波兰严厉地和坚决地谴责美国在黎巴嫩和英国在约旦的干涉。波兰是首先承认伊拉克共和国的国家之一，并支持阿拉伯国家的民族革命运动。
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长和傅拉托临时代办的这些话，博得了出席招待会的中外人士长时间的掌声。
    宾主在讲话中还畅述了波兰在十四年中取得的惊人成就和中波两国日益发展着的深厚友谊。陈毅说：社会主义的波兰是一支重要的和平力量，它一贯为维护欧洲和世界的和平而斗争，并且作出了有价值的贡献。中国人民对波兰人民所获得的巨大成就感到高兴，并且期望着波兰人民在社会主义建设的事业中获得新的、更大的胜利。他说：中波两国的团结互助关系一直在顺利地发展着，我们两国今年在经济合作方面的跃进更是令人感到满意。波兰人民可以相信，中国人民将为进一步增进我们两国的友好合作而努力。他说：中波两国人民团结的加强有利于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。这种团结是我们阵营各国顺利建设社会主义和维护世界和平的强大保证。正因为如此，帝国主义者和现代修正主义者就特别憎恨并且极力破坏这种团结。他们对哥穆尔卡同志最近在格但斯克的演说中强调社会主义阵营的团结，谴责现代修正主义和支持匈牙利处决叛徒纳吉，而感到愤怒，这是很自然的。
    傅拉托说，在过去的十四年里，波兰已从一个农业、经济落后的国家变成一个有极大发展前途的工业国家。现在波兰的工业产量已达到1938年的五倍，并将在未来的七年中达到战前水平的十倍。波兰统一工人党正在领导波兰人民实现伟大的社会主义的任务。现在人民波兰不再是孤立的了。它和第一个、历史最久的和最强大的社会主义国家苏联、伟大的中国和其他人民民主国家在一起属于社会主义国家的大家庭。人民波兰同这些国家的友谊和兄弟般合作正在日渐增长。奠基在共同的马克思列宁主义思想和整个社会主义阵营共同的和平目的之上的这种社会主义国家的友谊和联盟是牢不可破的。波中两国之间的友谊和兄弟般合作正在不断加强。波兰人民怀着钦佩的心情注视着中国人民在社会主义建设事业中的伟大成就。
    傅拉托说：曾饱尝战争悲剧经验的我国人民在国际政策方面反对一切使国际局势尖锐化的企图，特别是反对曾给人类带来如此巨大痛苦的德国军国主义的复活。所以波兰提出了“拉帕茨基计划”——就是在欧洲建立无原子地区的计划，并且支持旨在缓和国际紧张局势的一切倡议。为了使人类避免原子战争的威胁，为了保卫和平，为了和平共处与全人类的幸福，波兰渴望全世界人民的合作。
    盛大的招待会举行了近两小时。
