    Eastern Giant Dragon Ascends the Ninth Heaven
    Tricycle Worker Zhang Zhengchao
    The General Line is a swift horse's whip,
    Swift horse, whip it faster than an arrow,
    A thousand *li* by day, eight hundred by night,
    Why need fifteen years to overtake England?
    The General Line is a great bronze bell,
    The bell's sound shakes the heavens and the earth,
    The Eastern giant dragon stretches its waist and rises,
    With a crash of thunder, it ascends the Ninth Heaven!
    [Nanjing "Poetry Handout"] (with picture)
    Zhang Fugen made it.

    东方巨龙上九重
    三轮车工人  张正超
    总路线是快马鞭，
    快马加鞭飞如箭，
    日行千里夜八百，
    赶英何须十五年？
    总路线是大洪钟，
    钟声一响天地动，
    东方巨龙伸腰起，
    霹雳一声上九重！
