Millet Also Launches "Satellites"
Shaanxi Farmers Strengthen Field Management to Strive for All-Around Bumper Harvest

(Our Dispatch) (Reporter Zhu Bo) Shaanxi Province's farmers are strengthening field management of millet and foxtail millet, proposing to remove the label of low-yield grain crops from millet and foxtail millet this autumn, and determined to launch high-yield "satellites" of millet and foxtail millet. Millet and foxtail millet are among the main grain crops in Shaanxi Province. The province has planted over 9 million mu, accounting for more than 10% of the total autumn grain crop area in the province. Especially in the Shaanxi North area, the planting area of millet and foxtail millet is the largest, accounting for about 80% of the total planting area of millet and foxtail millet in the province. Therefore, increasing the yield of millet and foxtail millet is of great significance to Shaanxi Province (especially the Shaanxi North area) in realizing the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. In the past, the yield of millet and foxtail millet in Shaanxi Province was very low. The yield per mu in Yan'an and Yulin areas of Shaanxi North was only 40 to 50 jin, and the yield per mu of millet and foxtail millet in the fertile Guanzhong Plain area was only about 100 jin. At present, farmers in various places are strengthening the field management of millet and foxtail millet, striving for an all-around bumper harvest of millet and foxtail millet this year. The Yan'an Special District has revised the production targets for over 1.4 million mu of millet and foxtail millet, proposing to double the yield per mu in the whole district (of which millet will be increased from 90 jin per mu last year to 200 jin; foxtail millet will be increased from 83 jin per mu last year to 150 jin) to ensure the completion of this year's task of increasing grain production by 1,000 jin per person in the whole district. Farmers in Ganquan, Yan'an, Luochuan, Huanglong, Huangling and other counties of Yan'an Special District are carrying out a processing campaign for millet and foxtail millet in accordance with the new production increase measures. Their slogan is to apply 5,000 to 10,000 jin of top dressing fertilizer universally, and to carry out 3 to 5 times of cultivation and weeding universally. Agricultural cooperatives and cadres in various places have universally established high-yield experimental fields for millet and foxtail millet. They are determined to create the highest record of millet and foxtail millet yield and release the largest "satellite" of millet and foxtail millet yield in the country. The Oriental Red Agricultural Cooperative in Yan'an County has a large area of 736 mu of high-yield foxtail millet, with a planned yield of 339 jin per mu, more than twice as high as last year. The high-yield millet field covers 552 mu, with a planned yield of 449 jin per mu, more than three times as high as last year. The high-yield experimental field is 13 mu, with a planned yield of over 1,200 jin per mu.

### 糜谷也要放射“卫星”  陕西农民加强田间管理争取全面丰收

    糜谷也要放射“卫星”
    陕西农民加强田间管理争取全面丰收
    本报讯　记者朱波报道：陕西省各地农民加强糜子和谷子的田间管理，提出要在今年秋季摘掉糜、谷是低产粮食作物的帽子，并决心放射糜、谷高产的“卫星”。糜、谷是陕西省的主要粮食作物之一。全省共播种九百多万亩，约占全省秋季粮食作物总面积10％以上。尤其是陕北地区，糜谷种植面积最大，约占全省糜、谷播种面积的80％左右。因此，提高糜、谷产量，对陕西省（特别是陕北地区）提前实现农业发展纲要有着很重要的意义。过去，陕西省糜、谷产量很低。陕北的延安、榆林等地区亩产只有四、五十斤，土地肥沃的关中平原地区的糜、谷，亩产也只有百斤左右。目前，各地的农民正在加强对糜、谷的田间管理，争取今年的糜、谷全面丰收。延安专区对一百四十多万亩糜谷的生产指标，重新进行了修改，提出全区亩产翻一番（其中糜子由去年的亩产九十斤提高到二百斤；谷子由去年亩产八十三斤提高到一百五十斤。）来保证完成今年全区每人一千斤粮的增产任务。延安专区的甘泉、延安、洛川、黄龙、黄陵等县的农民，按照新的增产措施，开展对糜、谷的加工运动。他们的口号是普遍地施追肥五千到一万斤，普遍的进行中耕锄草三至五次。各地农业社和干部普遍建立糜、谷高额丰产试验田，他们下决心创造糜谷丰产的最高记录，放出全国糜、谷丰产中最大的一颗“卫星”。延安县东方红农业社大面积丰产谷共有七百三十六亩，计划亩产三百三十九斤，比去年高两倍以上。糜子丰产田共五百五十二亩，计划亩产四百四十九斤，比去年高三倍以上。高额丰产试验田十三亩，计划亩产一千二百斤以上。
