Xinjiang Wheat Achieves Unprecedented Bumper Harvest
Ningxia Region Estimated to Increase Production by 80% Compared to Last Year

    (Our report) As news of bumper wheat harvests spread throughout the country, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where the summer harvest season is later, has reaped an unprecedented bumper harvest of 11 million mu of winter and spring wheat north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. According to actual yields and field forecasts, the average yield of wheat in the region can reach more than 210 jin per mu, an increase of about 30% compared with last year, and an increase of more than 13% compared with 1954, the year with the highest yield in history, creating a bumper harvest year for Xinjiang's wheat yield to break the 200 jin mark.
    Wheat is Xinjiang's main food crop, accounting for about 40% of the region's grain crop area. Due to the bumper wheat harvest, this year's total wheat production can reach more than 2.3 billion jin, an increase of 33% compared with last year. Since mid-June, more than 5 million mu of wheat in the early-warming southern Xinjiang region and the Turpan Basin have been fully harvested. North of the Tianshan Mountains, from the banks of the Manas River to the fertile fields of the Ili River Valley, a thousand miles of golden wheat fields can be harvested in mid-July. Wheat in various parts of the autonomous region is growing better than any other year, with stalks reaching chest height, large ears full of grains, and more than 300,000 plants per mu. Recently, news of bumper harvests has been frequently reported from various places. The Kashgar area, Xinjiang's main wheat-producing area, with more than 2 million mu of wheat, has an average yield of 220 jin per mu, an increase of more than 30% compared with last year. According to the harvest situation in the Hotan area, the yield per mu is about 250 jin. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' one million mu of wheat will also achieve its biggest harvest in nine years this year. According to identification, the average yield per mu is more than 250 jin. The Ili Reclamation Area's 220,000 mu can reach 400 jin per mu, and there are 15,000 mu of thousand-jin wheat fields.
    This year's bumper wheat harvest in the autonomous region is the result of the hard work of farmers of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Party and governments at all levels, and their hard work last winter and this spring. Before liberation, Xinjiang's wheat cultivation technology was very backward and yields were very low. In 1949, the average yield per mu was only 120 jin. After liberation, yields increased year by year, but the largest bumper harvest year - 1954 - the yield per mu was only 183 jin. Encouraged by the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, farmers of all ethnic groups went all out last winter and this spring, comprehensively reformed cultivation techniques, and the phenomenon of broadcasting seeds has been basically eliminated. Strip planting and close planting have been universally implemented, and more than 80% of winter wheat has been winter irrigated. In the past, field management was rarely carried out during the wheat growing season, and grass and wheat seedlings were the same height; this year, most wheat fields have been spring harrowed to conserve moisture, topdressed, and weeded. Since the beginning of spring this year, the drought in southern Xinjiang has been more serious. The majority of farmers launched a well-drilling and drought-resistant campaign, and adopted the method of frequent watering and shallow irrigation to save water, so that all wheat fields were watered two to four times, ensuring wheat greening, jointing, booting, and grain filling.

    (Our report) Wheat in the Ningxia area has begun to mature, and a golden wheat sea stretches for six or seven hundred miles along the Yellow River on the Yinchuan Plain. This year's more than 2.8 million mu of wheat in the region is estimated to have a total output of more than 740 million jin, an increase of more than 320 million jin compared with last year. Now, Hui and Han farmers are actively rushing to make harvesting tools. Some places have also launched a summer harvest debate, proposing six slogans such as "cleaning up the fields in five days, clearing the threshing ground in half a month" and "competing for speed, competing for early harvesting, competing for meticulous harvesting, competing for cleanliness, competing for the delivery of public grain and fulfilling unified purchase grain," to welcome this unprecedented bumper harvest. On the Yinchuan Plain along the Yellow River, according to field identification and prediction, the average yield per mu of more than one million mu of wheat this year can reach more than 470 jin, an increase of more than 60% per mu compared with last year.

    新疆小麦空前大丰收
    宁夏地区估计可比去年增产八成
    本报讯  当全国各地小麦丰收捷报频传的时候，夏收季节较晚的新疆维吾尔自治区天山南北一千一百万亩冬春小麦获得空前未有的大丰收。根据各地实收和田间预测，全区小麦平均单产可达二百一十斤以上，比去年增产三成左右，比历年单产最高的1954年增产13％以上，创造了新疆历史上小麦单产突破二百斤大关的丰收年。
    小麦是新疆主要粮食作物，种植面积占全疆粮食作物面积40％左右。由于小麦获得大丰收，今年麦子的总产量可达到二十三亿斤以上，比去年增产33％。6月中旬以来，早暖的南疆地区和吐鲁番盆地五百多万亩小麦已全面开镰，天山北部从玛纳斯河两岸到伊犁河谷千里沃野上也已一片金黄，7月中旬可以收割。自治区各地小麦长得比任何一年都好，秆高齐胸，穗大粒满，每亩植株都在三十万株以上。最近，各地丰收喜讯频频传来。新疆主要产麦区喀什专区二百多万亩小麦平均单产可达二百二十斤，比去年增加30％以上。和阗专区根据收获情况，单产都在二百五十斤左右。新疆生产建设兵团一百万亩小麦今年也将获得九年来最大一次丰收，根据鉴定，平均单产在二百五十斤以上。伊犁垦区二十二万亩单产可达到四百斤，并有一万五千亩千斤麦田。
    自治区今年小麦大丰收是各族农民在党和各级政府领导下，鼓足干劲，在去冬今春艰苦奋战的结果。解放前，新疆小麦栽培技术很落后，产量也很低。1949年平均亩产只有一百二十斤，解放后产量逐年提高，但最大的丰收年——1954年单产也只有一百八十三斤。在全国大跃进的形势鼓舞下，各族农民在去冬今春鼓足了干劲，全面改革了耕作技术，播种上的撒播现象已基本消灭，普遍实行了条播密植，80％以上的冬麦进行了冬灌。过去在小麦生长期间很少进行田间管理，草和麦苗一样高；今年大部麦地都进行了春耙保墒、追肥和除草。今年入春以来，南疆旱象较重，广大农民就展开打井抗旱运动，并采用勤浇浅灌办法节约用水，使所有麦地都浇了两次水到四次水，保证了小麦返青、拔节、孕穗和灌浆。（谈风）
    本报讯  宁夏地区小麦开始成熟，在黄河两岸纵长达六、七百里的银川平原上，一片金黄色的麦海。今年全区二百八十多万亩小麦，据初步估算总产量可达到七亿四千多万斤，比去年增产三亿二千多万斤。现在回汉族农民正在积极赶制收割农具，有些地方还开展了夏收大辩论，提出“五天地净、半月场光”和“比快，比早，比细收，比净，比交公粮和完成统购粮”等六比口号，迎接这个空前大丰收。黄河两岸的银川平原上，据田间鉴定和预测，今年一百多万亩小麦平均亩产可达到四百七十多斤，比去年每亩增产60％多。  （马玉平）
