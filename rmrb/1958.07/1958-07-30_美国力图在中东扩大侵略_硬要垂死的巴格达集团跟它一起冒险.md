Xinhua News Agency, July 29th, London: A statement issued after the first day of meetings in London on the 28th between the four remaining member states of the "Baghdad Pact" and the United States shows that the United States has taken measures to give a "shot in the arm" to save this fragmented tool of aggression.

    The statement, signed by the Prime Ministers of Britain, Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, and U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, announced that the United States and Britain would continue to maintain the "Baghdad Pact," which had been declared bankrupt due to the Iraqi revolution. At the same time, the United States promised to assume more "obligations" militarily and to sign bilateral agreements on "security and defense" with the remaining member states of the treaty. The statement said that the United States "agreed to cooperate with the countries issuing this statement for their security and defense and will immediately conclude agreements to achieve this cooperation." Thus, although the United States has not formally joined the "Baghdad Pact," it has actually assumed the responsibilities of a formal member.

    Previously, the United States had always been hesitant in its approach to supporting this military aggressive bloc. Although the United States had long participated in the activities of the military committee, economic committee, and the so-called "anti-subversion" committee, which planned subversive activities, it had always pretended to have no direct relationship with this aggressive bloc. Now, in order to save this bankrupt military treaty organization, it finally had to take off its mask.

    The statement from the "Baghdad Pact" Council meeting also shows that the United States is trying to intensify the connection between this group and other military groups it controls, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Manila Treaty Organization. The statement said that the treaty's "relations with other free world countries united for collective security are being established." The statement also said: "Joint military plans have been proposed, and regional economic plans have been strengthened." The statement also clamored for a "determination" to further strengthen the "joint defense position" of the United States and the four other member states in the Middle East. However, it cannot but admit that the group has completely failed and been discredited, so the statement said that the governments of these countries are considering "whether the treaty and its organization should be substantially changed or whether the treaty will continue to exist in its current form."

    In his speech at the meeting on the 28th, Dulles tried his best to encourage the vassal states, and his hideous features were fully exposed as he clamored that he would "take great risks" to safeguard the "independence and integrity of our friends." He stated that the United States would take action without fear of war. He sophistically attempted to justify the United States' aggression against Lebanon and repeated the shameless fabrication of someone "indirectly invading" Lebanon, like a thief crying "stop thief."

    Dulles also tried his best to attack the United Arab Republic. He indicated that the United States' dispatch of troops to Lebanon was also to oppose Nasser and to stop Nasser's so-called "ambitions." He attacked Nasser for not representing true Arab nationalism.

    Referring to the summit conference to resolve the Middle East situation, Dulles indicated that he would use various excuses to obstruct and undermine the convening of such a conference.

    Dulles said that the United States "does not want the Soviet Union to gain a special position in the Middle East." He said, "If the West accepts Khrushchev's original proposal to hold a five-power summit, that would mean doing just that." After delivering this speech, Dulles left London early on the evening of the 28th to return to his country. The "Baghdad Pact" Council meeting continued today, with U.S. Ambassador to Britain Whitney replacing Dulles as an "observer" to attend the meeting.

### 美国力图在中东扩大侵略  硬要垂死的巴格达集团跟它一起冒险

    美国力图在中东扩大侵略
    硬要垂死的巴格达集团跟它一起冒险
    新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：“巴格达条约”的四个残余成员国和美国28日在伦敦开了第一天会议后发表的声明表明，美国为了挽救这个支离破碎的侵略工具，采取了“打强心针”的措施。
    这个由英国、土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦四国的首相和总理以及美国国务卿杜勒斯签署的声明宣布，美国和英国一起还要把这个由于伊拉克革命而宣告破产的“巴格达条约”继续维持下去。同时，美国答应将在军事上承担更多的“义务”，同这个条约的残余成员国分别签订关于“安全和防御”的双边协定。声明表示，美国“同意同发表这项声明的国家为了它们的安全和防御进行合作，并将立即缔结协定以实现这种合作”。这样，美国虽然没有正式参加“巴格达条约”，实际上就担负了正式成员国的责任。
    在这以前，美国在支持这个军事侵略集团的作法上总是慑手慑脚的。美国虽然早已经参加了这个军事集团的军事委员会、经济委员会和策划颠覆活动的所谓“反颠覆”委员会的活动，但是它一直把自己打扮得好像同这个侵略集团没有直接关系似的。现在，为了挽救这个已经破了产的军事条约组织，它终于不得不把戴着的面具拿了下来。
      “巴格达条约”理事会会议的这个声明还表明，美国企图加紧把这个集团同它所控制的其他军事集团，例如北大西洋集团和马尼拉条约组织连结起来。声明说，这个条约“同为了集体安全而联合起来的其他自由世界国家的关系正在建立”。声明还说：“联合军事计划已经提出，区域性经济计划已经加强”。这个声明还叫嚷“决心”要进一步加强美国和四个其他成员国在中东地区的“联合防御地位”。但是，它不能不承认，这个集团已完全失败和声名扫地，因此，声明说，这些国家的政府正在考虑“条约及其组织是否应该作出实质性改变或者条约是否将继续按照目前形式存在的问题”。
    杜勒斯在28日会议上发言中竭力为仆从国打气，他狰狞面貌毕露地叫嚣：不惜“冒很大的危险”来维护“我们朋友的独立和完整”。他表示，美国将不怕爆发战争而采取行动。他强词夺理地企图为美国侵略黎巴嫩的罪恶行为辩护，并且重复了所谓有人“间接侵略”黎巴嫩的贼喊捉贼式的无耻捏造。
    杜勒斯还竭力攻击阿拉伯联合共和国。他表明，美国出兵黎巴嫩还为了反对纳赛尔，为了制止所谓纳赛尔的“野心”。他攻击纳赛尔并不代表真正的阿拉伯民族主义。
    杜勒斯在提到为解决中东局势而召开的政府首脑会议时，表示他将利用各种借口来阻挠和破坏这种会议的召开。
    杜勒斯说，美国“不想让苏联在中东取得特别的地位”。他说，“如果西方接受赫鲁晓夫原来的那个关于举行五大国最高级会议的建议的话，那就意味着恰恰是那样做。”杜勒斯在发表这个演讲之后，已经在28日晚上提前离开伦敦回国。“巴格达条约”理事会会议今天继续举行，美国驻英国大使惠特尼代替杜勒斯担任“观察员”出席会议。
