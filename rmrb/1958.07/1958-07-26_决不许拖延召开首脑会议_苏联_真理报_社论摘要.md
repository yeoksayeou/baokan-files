Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25th: Today's "Pravda" editorial points out that the whole world is now waiting for the Western countries to give a swift and affirmative answer to the Soviet Union's agreement to hold a summit conference within the Security Council. The editorial said that at this critical juncture for the fate of mankind, no delay should be allowed in convening a high-level meeting.

The editorial, entitled "A High-Level Meeting Must Be Held Without Delay," said that under the pressure of world public opinion, the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France have been forced to express their willingness to hold high-level talks in one way or another. However, they put forward a condition: that such talks should be held within the framework of the United Nations Security Council.

The editorial said that many well-informed American newspapers openly stated that the American ruling circles estimated that the Soviet Union would reject this condition. Everyone knows that this expectation was wrong. The Soviet government accepted the proposal of British Prime Minister Macmillan to convene a summit conference within the framework of the Security Council.

The editorial said that the international situation requires urgent measures to extinguish the flames of war in the Middle East. The Soviet Union's position on holding a summit conference within the Security Council with the participation of the Prime Minister of India and the relevant Arab countries is fully in line with the requirements of the times and the interests of universal peace. The whole world is now waiting for the Western countries to give a swift and affirmative answer.

However, there are reports from abroad that some people in the United States, Britain, and France are openly adopting a policy of delaying negotiations.

The editorial said that the people of the world firmly advocate the immediate convening of a high-level meeting. They unanimously demand an end to the aggression against the Middle East and the safeguarding of world peace and security.

    决不许拖延召开首脑会议
    苏联“真理报”社论摘要
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”今天的社论指出，全世界现在都在等待西方国家对苏联同意在安全理事会内举行政府首脑会议这一点迅速作出肯定的答复。社论说，在这人类命运处在危险的关头，决不允许拖延召开高级会议。
    这篇题为“必须毫不迟延地召开高级会议”的社论说，在世界舆论的压力下，美、英、法三国的政府首脑被迫用这种或那种方式表示愿意举行高级谈判。但是，他们提出条件：要在联合国安全理事会范围内举行这种会谈。
    社论说，许多消息极为灵通的美国报纸公开说，美国统治集团估计苏联会拒绝这个条件。大家知道，这种指望是失算了。苏联政府接受了英国首相麦克米伦所提出的、关于在安理会范围内召开政府首脑会议的主张。
    社论说，国际局势要求采取紧急措施来扑灭中近东的战争火苗。苏联对在安全理事会范围内举行有印度总理和有关的阿拉伯国家参加的政府首脑会议的问题所采取的立场，是完全符合时代要求、符合普遍和平的利益的。现在全世界都在等待西方国家作出迅速而肯定的答复。
    但是国外有消息说，美国、英国和法国的某些人士正在公然采取拖延谈判的方针。
    社论说，全世界人民坚决主张立即召开高级会议。他们一致要求停止对中近东的侵略，保障世界和平和安全。
