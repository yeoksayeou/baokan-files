To adapt to the great leap forward in socialist construction and the in-depth development of the rectification movement, the State Council recently conducted a preliminary review of various laws and regulations it and the former Government Administration Council had formulated over the years, and held an "Exhibition of Regulations and Rules of the State Council" based on the findings and issues identified.

The exhibition introduced the general situation of the various laws and regulations issued by central state organs over the years and various examples of current regulations. From several charts, we can see the tremendous achievements in China's legal construction. In the more than eight years since the founding of the country, a total of 10,110 various laws and regulations have been formulated by the central state organs, of which 6,560 are currently in effect, excluding those that have been repealed or are outdated. This fact powerfully refutes the slander by rightists that China "has no laws to abide by." From these charts, we can also see the laws and regulations adapting to the laws and characteristics of economic base development. For example, among the 1,713 laws and regulations formulated by the highest state power organs and the central government, the number was the largest in 1950, the smallest in 1953, and gradually increased after 1954. This precisely illustrates that after the abolition of old laws at the beginning of the founding of the country, it was extremely necessary to establish revolutionary laws to meet the needs of various tasks; while 1953 was precisely when profound changes began to occur in the ownership system, so it was impossible to formulate many laws and regulations; thereafter, due to the abolition of the greater administrative areas and the promulgation of the Constitution, in order to adapt to the rapid development of socialist transformation and socialist construction, many laws and regulations needed to be revised and unified by the central government, so the number of laws and regulations gradually increased again; until the rectification movement began last year, the number of laws and regulations gradually decreased again. At the same time, among the above-mentioned 1,713 laws and regulations, financial and economic laws and regulations accounted for 64%, which precisely illustrates the characteristic that China's socialist legal system mainly serves the country's economic construction.

The exhibition showed that all kinds of laws and regulations formulated by the government that embodied the Party's policies, summarized the masses' struggle experience, proceeded from reality, and implemented the mass line method were effective, played a promoting role, and were enthusiastically supported by the broad masses. The decision of the former Government Administration Council on the division of rural class components is one example. This decision was based on Chairman Mao Zedong's analysis of Chinese society in 1926 and summarized the historical experience since the 1933 Ruijin Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government on how to analyze rural classes and correctly resolve the land problem. It tells people that the peasant problem is a fundamental problem, and distinguishing between enemies and friends is the primary problem of the revolution; it not only powerfully guaranteed the correct implementation of land reform in the past, but also continues to play a significant role in the future. Also exhibited here are the regulations on the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, which creatively applied Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory in combination with China's actual conditions, as well as many other regulations that correctly embody the Party's policies in political and legal affairs, finance and economics, culture and education, ethnic affairs, and overseas Chinese affairs.

The exhibition displayed some examples of subjectivism and detachment from reality in the current regulations issued or approved by the former Government Administration Council and the State Council. Some of these regulations were not based on in-depth investigation and research or the mass line method when they were formulated. For example, the "Provisional Rules for the Implementation of Railway Monthly Transportation Plans" approved by the former Government Administration Council contained many provisions that were copied from foreign countries, mechanically stipulating that the types of goods in the planned transportation should not be changed. According to this mechanical provision, unreasonable phenomena occurred, such as the inability to change the transportation of Chinese cabbage to potatoes, cotton cloth to clothing, and paper to printed matter. Some regulations concerning health and medical affairs were detached from politics and copied old laws. The "Methods for Compiling Currency Revenue and Expenditure" once stipulated that all currency revenue and expenditure of enterprises should go through banks in order to reflect and supervise all financial activities of the enterprises. This method directly interfered with the independent economic activities of enterprises, was not practical, and wasted a lot of manpower and material resources for enterprises and banks when compiling currency revenue and expenditure plans, so it was opposed by all parties and stopped informally after only one year of implementation. In the past, due to the adoption of a passive balance method in planning work, the regulations in this area actually fostered conservative ideas.

Among some of the regulations that still have problems, many were originally correct, but due to changes in objective circumstances, especially due to the change in the ownership of the means of production, they were not revised or abolished in time, and therefore do not meet the actual needs. For example, some industrial and commercial tax regulations formulated in the past played a significant role in restricting, utilizing, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, but at present, they are hindering the economic accounting and production development of socialist enterprises.

Judging from the statistics on the need to revise and abolish regulations exhibited at the exhibition, systematically sorting out the current regulations is of great significance for improving government work. Taking the 1,606 regulations promulgated by the central government in more than eight years as an example, among them, 661 have become outdated or explicitly abolished. Among the 945 current regulations, 47% can continue to be applied, 33% need to be slightly revised and can still be applied, 13% need to be abolished and re-established, that is, redrafted or merged and drafted, and 7% need to be abolished. This statistic shows that the proportion of current regulations that cannot continue to be applied and must be abolished is not very large, but at the same time, it also shows that the number of regulations that need to be abolished and those that need to be revised is relatively large, so it is necessary to organize forces in a timely manner to sort out and improve them. As pointed out in the report of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, this is a major task, and all localities and departments must take some time and manpower to carry it out.

In addition, the exhibition used specific examples to illustrate that the formulation, revision, and abolition of regulations should pay attention to certain procedures and grammatical logic. The exhibition also showed that government departments still have the phenomenon of indiscriminately issuing statistical forms and reports, causing waste of manpower and material resources, as well as the situation and problems that the editing and compilation of relevant regulations and bulletins do not meet the needs of the masses.

This exhibition reflects one aspect of the significant achievements made by the government's work in the rectification movement, and shows that the Party and the government are paying great attention to systematically sorting out current regulations to make various rules and regulations more adapted to the needs of economic base and productivity development. Many responsible comrades believe after visiting the exhibition that it has a great promoting effect on implementing the spirit of rectification and improving government work. It is best for all provinces and cities to send people to visit and hold on-site meetings on improving regulations and rules to promote it. Vice Premier Chen Yi also pointed out that it is best to hold such exhibitions once a year, which will have more direct guiding significance for the work. (Attached picture)

### 国务院规章制度展览会

    国务院规章制度展览会
    新华社记者　朱敏之
    适应社会主义建设事业的大跃进和整风运动的深入发展，国务院最近对自己和原政务院历年来所制定的各项法规，进行了初步检查，并将检查出的情况和问题，举办了“国务院规章制度展览会”。
    展览会介绍了中央国家机关历年来发布法规的总情况和现行法规的各种范例。从几个图表中，可以看到我国法制建设上的巨大成绩。建国八年多来，总计由中央国家机关先后制定的各种法规有一万零一百一十件之多，其中除已废止和过时的外，属于现行的为六千五百六十件。这个事实有力地驳斥了右派分子污蔑我国“无法可依”的谰言。从这些图表中，还可以看出我国法制适应经济基础发展的规律和特点。例如，在最高国家权力机关和中央政府制定的一千七百一十三件法规中，以1950年为数最多，1953年最少，1954年后又逐渐增多。这正是说明，建国之初废除旧法后，极需建立革命法制以适应各项工作的需要；而1953年，正是所有制开始发生深刻变化，因而也不可能制定许多法规；其后因各大区撤销和宪法公布，为了适应社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，许多法规需要修改和由中央统一制定，所以法规又逐渐增多起来；至去年整风开始后，法规又逐渐减少。同时，在上述一千七百一十三件法规中，财经法规占64％，这正说明我国的社会主义法制主要是为国家经济建设服务的特点。
    展览会表明了政府制订的各种法规，凡是体现了党的政策，总结了群众的斗争经验，从实际出发，并且贯彻了群众路线方法的，都是行之有效，起促进作用，并且为广大群众所热烈拥护。原政务院关于划分农村阶级成分的决定就是一个例子。这个决定是根据毛泽东主席1926年对中国社会的分析，并且总结了1933年瑞金中央工农民主政府以来的怎样分析农村阶级和正确地解决土地问题的历史经验而制定的。它告诉人们，农民问题是根本问题，而区分敌友，又是革命的首要问题；它不仅在过去有力地保证了土地改革的正确执行，而且今后仍然起着重大的作用。这里展出的还有创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义革命理论结合中国实际情况而制定的有关改造资本主义工商业的法规，以及其他许多正确地体现了党在政法、财经、文教、民族、华侨等方面等政策的法规。
    展览会展出了原政务院和国务院发布或批准发布的现行法规中存在着一些主观主义和脱离实际的事例。其中有些法规在制定时没有经过深入的调查研究和走群众路线。如过去政务院批准的“铁路月度运输计划执行暂行规则”，其中不少规定是搬用外国的，机械规定计划运输的货物品类不准变更，按照这个机械的规定，因而发生了运白菜的不能改运土豆，运棉布的不能改运衣服，运纸张的不能改运印刷品等不合理的现象。有些有关卫生医务的法规，脱离政治，抄袭了旧法。“货币收支编制办法”曾规定企业单位的全部货币收支都通过银行，以反映和监督企业单位的全部财务活动。这个办法由于直接干涉企业的独立的经济活动，不切合实际，并且使企业单位和银行在编制货币收支计划时浪费了大量人力物力，因此仅仅实行了一年就受到各方面反对，无形中停止了。在计划工作上过去由于采取了消极平衡的方法，因而这方面的法规实际上助长了保守思想。
    在至今存在着问题的一些法规中，较多的是原来正确，但由于客观情况的变化，特别是由于生产资料所有制的改变，而没有及时地进行修改或废止，因此不适应实际的需要。例如，过去制定的一些工商税法规，在限制、利用、改造资本主义工商业等方面曾起了很大的作用，但在目前，却对社会主义企业实行经济核算和发展生产有了妨碍。
    从展览会上展出的关于法规需要修改和废止的统计数字来看，系统地整理现行法规对改进政府工作具有重大意义。以中央政府八年多来颁布的一千六百零六件法规来说，其中除六百六十一件已经过时或明文废止外，在现行的九百四十五件法规中，可以继续适用的占47％，需要稍加修改仍可适用的占33％，需要废旧立新的，即重新起草或合并起草的占13％，需要废止的占7％。这个统计一方面说明现行法规中根本不能继续适用而须废除的比重不是很大，但同时也说明需要废止的和需要修改的法规加在一起，数量就比较大，因此必须及时地组织力量加以整理改进，正如中共中央八大二次会议报告中指出的，这是一项重大的工作，各地方、各部门都必须拿出一定的时间和人力来进行。
    此外，展览会以具体事例，说明了法规的制定、修改和废止，应当注意一定程序和文法逻辑。展览会还展出政府部门几年来仍有滥发统计表报造成人力物力浪费的现象，以及有关法规和公报的编辑、编纂工作不适应群众需要的情况和问题。
    这个展览会反映了政府工作在整风运动中所获得的重大成果的一个方面，表明了党和政府正在以极大的注意力，通过对现行法规的系统整理，使各种规章制度更加适应经济基础和生产力发展的需要。许多负责同志参观后都认为这个展览会对于贯彻整风精神，改进政府工作，有很大的推动作用，各省市最好派人来参观，并且就改进规章制度问题举行现场会议以资推广。陈毅副总理并指出，这种展览会最好每年能举行一次，这样对工作更有直接的指导意义。（附图片）
