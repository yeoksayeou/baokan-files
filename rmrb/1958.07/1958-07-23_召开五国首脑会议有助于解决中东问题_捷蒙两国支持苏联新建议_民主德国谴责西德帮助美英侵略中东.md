Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 22nd. According to a report in today’s “Red Right,” Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David said last night to reporters from the Czechoslovak News Agency and Radio that the Czechoslovak government believes that the Soviet proposal to immediately hold a five-nation summit conference to stop the US-British military intervention in the Near and Middle East is the most timely and practically feasible measure at present. This measure will help quickly avoid the danger of war (which has already arisen in the Near and Middle East) and ensure conditions for strengthening peace and security in the region.

At the same time, the Czechoslovak government issued a statement on the 21st, fully supporting the Soviet government’s proposal to conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation among European countries, and announced that it is ready to conclude this treaty with other European countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, July 22nd. The government of the Mongolian People's Republic issued a statement today on the situation in the Near and Middle East.

The statement firmly condemns the aggressive acts of US-British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan, and expresses deep sympathy and support for the people of Lebanon and Jordan, as well as the people of Arab countries.

The statement said that the Mongolian government believes that US-British imperialism should be held directly responsible for the consequences of armed intervention in Arab countries, and believes that the United Nations, which is responsible for maintaining world peace, has no right to stand idly by and should take effective measures to stop the aggressive acts of US-British imperialism.

The statement also said that the Mongolian government fully supports the proposal of Soviet Premier Khrushchev to convene a five-nation summit conference, and believes that this proposal is a step that should be taken immediately to quickly resolve issues related to the situation in the Near and Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 21st. The government of the German Democratic Republic today sent a note to the West German government, condemning the West German government for pursuing a policy of supporting US-British armed intervention in the Middle East.

The note emphasized that the United States' use of West German territory to invade the Middle East may drag West Germany into the aggressive plans of other imperialist countries. The note said that this proves how correct and necessary the Democratic German government's proposal to the West German government to take joint steps to withdraw foreign troops from German territory is for safeguarding the interests of the German people.

The note demanded that the West German government immediately take all necessary measures to prevent West German troops from supporting or participating in US-British aggression in any way; to prohibit the use of airports and other military facilities within West German territory; to immediately prohibit US-British air force units heading to the Middle East from passing through West German airspace; and to punish all acts of using newspapers, radio, and other propaganda tools to support US-British aggression.

    新华社布拉格22日电  据“红色权利报”今天报道：捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维昨天晚上对捷克斯洛伐克通讯社和电台记者说，捷克斯洛伐克政府认为，苏联提出的立即举行五国政府首脑会议来制止美英在中近东的军事干涉的建议，是目前最切合时宜的和实际可行的措施。这种措施有助于迅速地避免战争的危险（这种危险已经在中近东产生），并且确保加强这个地区的和平和安全的条件。
    同时，捷克斯洛伐克政府在21日发表声明，完全支持苏联政府关于缔结欧洲国家友好合作条约的建议，并且宣布它准备同其他欧洲国家缔结这项条约。
    据新华社乌兰巴托22日电  蒙古人民共和国政府今天就中近东局势发表声明。
    声明坚决谴责美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略行为，并且对黎巴嫩和约旦人民以及阿拉伯各国人民，表示深切的同情和支持。
    声明说，蒙古政府认为，美英帝国主义应当对武装干涉阿拉伯各国的后果负直接责任，并且认为，对维护世界和平负责的联合国没有权利袖手旁观，应该采取有效措施制止美英帝国主义的侵略行为。
    声明还说，蒙古政府完全支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫关于召开五国政府首脑会议的建议，并且认为这个建议是为迅速解决同中近东局势有关的问题应当立即采取的一个步骤。
    新华社柏林21日电  德意志民主共和国政府今天向西德政府发出一份照会，谴责西德政府奉行支持美英武装干涉中东的政策。
    照会强调指出，美国利用西德领土侵略中东，可能把西德拖进其他帝国主义国家的侵略计划。照会说，这证明，民主德国政府向西德政府提出的关于采取共同步骤以便使外国军队撤出德国领土的建议，对于维护德国人民的利益是如何正确和必要。
    照会要求西德政府立即采取一切必要的措施，以便不让西德军队在任何方式下支持或参加美英的侵略行动；不准许使用西德境内的飞机场和其他军事设备；立即禁止前往中东的美英空军部队通过西德领空；对一切利用报纸、广播和其他宣传工具支持美英侵略行动的行为加以惩处。
