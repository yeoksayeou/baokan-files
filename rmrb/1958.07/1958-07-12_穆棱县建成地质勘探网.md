    Muling County Builds a Geological Exploration Network
    (According to Heilongjiang Daily) Muling County is mobilizing the entire Party and all the people to engage in geology. Up to now, the county has discovered more than 40 types of minerals, with over 110 mineral sites, and more than 50 sites are already being mined.
    Muling County is one of the counties with the richest mineral resources, known as a "sea of coal" and a "mountain of gold." Recently, the County Party Committee implemented the policy of mobilizing the entire Party and all the people to engage in geology, and launched a large-scale publicity campaign for geological work throughout the county, mobilizing the masses to search for and report minerals. Now, everyone in every commune has a special interest in studying minerals. When commune members discover strange rocks in the mountains, they personally send them to the township people's committees. A geological network has now been formed in the county, with regular geological exploration teams in each township and commune, and each commune has established a specimen room. In order to promote geological work, the County Party Secretary, Bi Rentai, personally took charge and adopted the method of assigning responsibility for specific areas to explore the mountains in the snow this spring, opening up the geological work situation. Many townships and communes also had their secretaries taking the lead in grasping geological work. As a result, geological work has developed rapidly. At present, 42 exploration teams have been established throughout the county, and they have already mined more than 30 coal mines, 16 gold mines, and more than 10 other types of mines.

    据黑龙江日报讯　穆棱县全党、全民办地质。到目前为止，这个县已查出四十多个矿种，各种矿点一百一十多处，已开采的有五十余处。
    穆棱县是各种矿藏最富饶的县份，素有“煤海”“金山”之称。最近这个县县委贯彻了全党全民办地质的方针，在全县开展了声势浩大的地质工作的宣传运动，发动群众查矿报矿。现在每个社每个人都有研究矿石的特殊兴趣，社员们在山上发现奇怪的岩石，都亲自送到乡镇人民委员会。现在这个县的地质网已经形成，各乡各社都有经常的地质勘查小组，每个社都建立了标本室。为了推动地质工作，这个县的县委书记毕仁泰亲自挂帅，并采取分工包片的办法在今春踏雪进山勘探，打开了地质工作的局面。许多乡，社也都书记挂帅抓地质工作。因此地质工作开展的迅速。目前全县已建立起四十二个勘查小组，他们已开采煤矿三十余处，金矿十六处，以及其他各种矿十余处。
