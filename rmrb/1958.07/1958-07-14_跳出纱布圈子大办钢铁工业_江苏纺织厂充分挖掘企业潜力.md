Breaking Out of the Gauze Circle and Vigorously Develop the Steel Industry: Jiangsu Textile Factories Fully Tap Enterprise Potential

(Our Dispatch) Reporter Jiang Qingping reports: Textile factories in Jiangsu Province are breaking down walls, jumping out of the gauze circle, making full use of existing equipment, and extracting some manpower to vigorously develop the steel industry. The three cities of Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou, where the textile industry is concentrated, plan to start from scratch in textile factories this year, building more than two hundred steelmaking and ironmaking furnaces, with an annual output of more than 300,000 tons of pig iron and more than 100,000 tons of steel.

“Steelmaking and ironmaking is a matter for heavy industrial smelting plants. How can we light industrial textile factories do it?” “We have no equipment and no technology. How can we do it?” When the leading cadres of various factories began to propose the call to smelt steel in textile factories, many people's thinking was not clear, and they raised the above questions. Some factories then adopted forms such as big-character posters and discussion meetings to mobilize the masses to carry out debates. The central issue of the debate was "The Party calls on the whole people to start steel, can our textile factories be an exception?" "Do textile factories have the conditions for steelmaking and ironmaking?" Through debate, they unanimously realized that steel is the commander of industrial production and the key link of industry. Without the steel industry, the general line cannot be realized. They said: Vigorously developing steel is now the highest will of the people of the province. Even government cadres, students, shop assistants, and residents can start from scratch to refine steel. Why can't our textile factories break the rules? In the debate, everyone analyzed the potential of textile factories in terms of manpower, technology, and equipment, and unanimously believed that as long as they break superstitions and break through conventions, combining indigenous and foreign methods, it is entirely possible to smelt a large amount of steel in textile factories.

After the minds of the workers were liberated, a upsurge in vigorously developing the steel industry quickly swept through the textile factories. The Party committee secretaries and factory directors of many factories personally took command, transferring some mechanical maintenance workers, section management personnel, and apprentices to establish institutions and begin to build steelmaking and ironmaking furnaces. Forty-seven textile printing and dyeing factories and knitwear factories in Changzhou are all engaged in steelmaking and ironmaking. If a small factory cannot do it alone, several factories will join together to do it. If there are no conditions for foreign blast furnaces, then indigenous blast furnaces are built. The textile factories in the city adopted the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods. This year, they are preparing to build forty-one small blast furnaces with a volume of eight cubic meters or more, seventy-eight small ironmaking furnaces with a volume of three cubic meters or less, and eleven small steelmaking furnaces with a half-ton capacity.

Changzhou Minfeng Yarn Factory has used the factory's materials and equipment to build an ironmaking furnace. Some textile factories have also set up many satellite factories to solve the problem of steelmaking and ironmaking equipment. The textile factories in Wuxi City have already planned to build a refractory material factory, eight coking plants, and three blower manufacturing plants. According to the spirit of the general line and the instructions of the municipal party committee, Wuxi Qingfeng Textile Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, boldly envisioned tapping potential. Without increasing manpower or factory buildings, it decided to set up ten small factories, including bleaching and dyeing, canvas, ironmaking, chemical fiber, electrical repair and manufacturing, and papermaking, basically using the factory's equipment and leftovers.

While actively preparing to build steelmaking and ironmaking furnaces, the workers who stick to the textile production posts in various textile factories also vigorously carry out technological revolution, so that spinning, weaving, and steelmaking and ironmaking can leap forward side by side.

### 跳出纱布圈子大办钢铁工业  江苏纺织厂充分挖掘企业潜力

    跳出纱布圈子大办钢铁工业
    江苏纺织厂充分挖掘企业潜力
    本报讯　记者蒋青萍报道：江苏省纺织工厂打破围墙，跳出纱布圈子，充分利用现有设备，抽出部分人力，大办钢铁工业。纺织工业集中的常州、无锡、苏州三个市今年计划在纺织厂内白手起家，兴建炼钢炼铁炉两百多座，年产生铁三十多万吨、钢十万吨以上。
    “炼铁炼钢是重工业冶炼工厂的事，我们轻工业纺织厂怎么能搞？”“我们一无设备，二无技术怎么搞法？”当各厂领导干部开始提出要在纺织厂内炼出钢铁的号召时，许多人思想不通，并提出了上述问题。有些工厂便采取大字报、座谈会等形式，发动群众开展辩论。辩论的中心问题是“党号召全民动手搞钢铁，我们纺织厂能不能例外？”“纺织厂有没有条件炼钢炼铁？”通过辩论才一致认识到钢铁是工业生产的统帅，是工业的纲，没有钢铁工业就不能实现总路线。他们说：大搞钢铁现在已是全省人民的最高意志，连机关干部、学生、店员、居民都能白手起家炼钢铁，为什么我们纺织厂不能打破常规？辩论中大家分析了纺织厂的人力、技术和设备潜力，一致认为只要破除迷信冲破常规，土洋结合、纺织厂里完全可能炼出大量钢铁来。
    职工们思想解放后，大办钢铁工业的热潮便在纺织厂内迅速掀起。许多工厂的党委书记、厂长亲自挂帅，抽调一部分机械保全工人、科室管理人员和学徒成立机构，开始建立炼钢炼铁炉。常州市四十七个纺织印染、针织内衣厂，厂厂都搞炼钢炼铁，一个小厂搞不起来就几个厂联合起来搞，洋高炉没有条件搞就搞土高炉。全市纺织工厂采取土洋结合的办法，今年就准备建立八立方公尺以上的小高炉四十一座，三立方公尺以下的小炼铁炉七十八座，半吨小炼钢炉十一座。
    常州民丰纱厂利用厂内的材料和设备已经建成了一座炼铁炉。有些纺织厂围绕解决炼钢炼铁设备，还办了许多卫星厂。无锡市的纺织厂已筹建了一个耐火材料厂，八个炼焦厂和三个鼓风机制造厂。无锡市公私合营庆丰纺织厂根据总路线的精神和市委的指示，大胆设想挖掘潜力，在不增加人力、不增加厂房的情况下，基本上利用本厂设备和下脚料，决定兴办漂染、帆布、炼铁、化学纤维、电机修配制造、造纸等十一个小厂。
    各纺织厂在积极筹建炼钢炼铁炉的同时坚守纺织生产岗位的工人也大搞技术革命，使纺纱、织布和炼钢炼铁来一个并肩跃进。
