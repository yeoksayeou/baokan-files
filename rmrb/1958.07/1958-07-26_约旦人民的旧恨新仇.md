"There is only one way to drive the British paratroopers out of here – get rid of the person who invited them in.”

This stark threat against King Hussein of Jordan was uttered by a respected and influential Jordanian citizen, speaking with a modified Oxford accent. This person had previously expressed friendliness towards the West. His hostile attitude towards the British landing in Jordan last week is fairly typical of the attitude of people in this tense city.

Even before, anti-King Hussein sentiment was strong among the Jordanians. And the hatred of the British military landing by the majority of people has given the opposition more support.

Many signs indicate that young King Hussein is dangerously standing on the edge, as far as his own many people are concerned. This matter is of great significance, because both Britain and the United States are involved in the events here.

An American official lamented: "This is the Jordanian fortress, and we are throwing everything into it to save Hussein. He is our last line of defense."

Most British and American authorities here worry that if the small King Hussein loses control in the tide of Pan-Arab nationalism and is overthrown, the West will face the prospect of either military intervention again to maintain a pro-Western government in the Middle East, or watching the West's last stronghold in the Middle East disappear, leaving the Middle East's important oil at the mercy of the nationalists, causing the West to lose its strategic air base in this region, and opening the way for similar nationalist and anti-Western unrest in newly established African countries.

Western officials here admit that the longer the British army stays as a palace guard, the greater the pressure of nationalist sentiment will be, demanding the expulsion of the "imperialist occupation forces" through a violent action to depose Hussein.

An incident that occurred at the British Embassy here the other morning may be illustrative.

The British paratrooper commander arrived at the embassy in a jeep with smiling, tanned paratroopers. The British soldiers stood easily at the entrance of the embassy, while a group of Jordanian Legion soldiers, wearing red, pleated headscarves, stood uneasily on the side. When a photojournalist waved to them, loudly calling them to come closer to the British army, one of the Jordanian soldiers said some harsh words in Arabic. All the legion soldiers abruptly turned and walked away.

British paratroopers reported that many people glared at them as they drove past in jeeps. Officials worry that this outward indifference to the British "occupation forces" may develop into serious hostility and erupt openly.

    约旦人民的旧恨新仇
    “只有一个方法把英国的伞兵从这里赶出去——干掉那个请他们进来的人。”
    对约旦国王侯赛因的这个赤裸裸的威胁是一位受人尊敬的有影响的约旦公民用一种变了调的牛津重音说出来的。这个人过去对西方一直是表示友好的。他对英国上星期在约旦登陆所采取的敌视态度，是这个形势紧张的城市中的人们的相当典型的态度。
    即使在以前，在约旦人中，反对国王侯赛因的情绪是很强烈的。而大部分人民对英军登陆的仇恨已经使反对派获得更多的支持。
    许多迹象表明，就他自己的许多百姓而说，年轻的侯赛因国王是很危险地站在边缘之上。这件事具有极大意义，因为英国和美国都牵连在这里的事件中。
    一位美国官员感叹地说：“这是约旦堡垒，我们正在把一切东西投入其中来挽救侯赛因。他是我们最后的一道防线。”
    这里的大部分英美权威人士担心，如果小小的侯赛因国王在泛阿拉伯民族主义的浪潮中丧失了他的控制权并且被逐走的话，西方会面临这样一种前景：要么为了维持中东的亲西方政府再次进行军事干涉，要么眼看西方在中东的最后的据点消失，让中东的重要的石油听凭民族主义者摆布，使西方丧失它在这个地区的战略空军基地，为刚建立的非洲国家中类似的民族主义和反西方的骚乱开辟道路。
    这里的西方官员承认英国军队作为宫廷卫队呆得时间越长，那么民族主义情绪的压力就越大，这种压力要求通过一次废黜侯赛因的剧烈的暴力行动来驱逐
  “帝国主义占领军”。
    前几天早上在这里英国大使馆所发生的一件事件可能说明问题。
    英国伞兵司令同一吉普车面带笑容、晒黑了的伞兵到达了大使馆。英国兵很轻松地站在大使馆的大门口，在一边不安地站着一群约旦军团的士兵，他们戴着红色的有折纹的头巾。当摄影记者向他们招手大声地叫他们靠近英国军队的时候，有一个约旦兵用阿拉伯话说了一些刻薄的话。所有的军团士兵都粗暴地转身走开了。
    英国伞兵报告，当他们坐在吉普车里驶过的时候有许多人瞪眼。官员们担心这种对英国“占领军”外表上的冷淡可能发展成为严重的敌视而且公开爆发。
