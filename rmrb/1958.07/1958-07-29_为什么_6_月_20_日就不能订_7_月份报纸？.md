    Why Can't I Order a July Newspaper on June 20th?
    In June, our unit moved from Nanjing to Datong City. On the 20th of the same month, we went to the Datong Post Office to subscribe to the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine for the third quarter, but the post office refused to renew our subscription on the grounds that the subscription period had passed. As a result, many comrades in our unit did not receive the July issues of the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine. We are all long-time readers of the People's Daily, and it is a great loss for us not to be able to see the newspaper for a month and not to be able to learn about the important instructions and documents of the Party and the government, as well as the inspiring news from home and abroad, in a timely manner!
    The People's Daily and Red Flag magazine are our indispensable textbooks. However, the Datong Post Office does not proceed from the needs and convenience of the broad masses of readers, and still adheres to the unreasonable system of limited-time subscription to newspapers and periodicals, which is wrong. I suggest that they break with old conventions and systems, and improve the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in accordance with the principle of "everything for the convenience of readers."

    Editor's Note: Since seventeen advanced newspaper and periodical distribution workers across the country put forward the "Six Competition Initiatives" for improving newspaper and periodical distribution work in March this year, many post offices across the country have improved newspaper and periodical distribution work and achieved subscription and delivery on demand. The broad masses of readers have sent letters expressing their welcome and praise. However, many readers have still written to reflect that the newspaper and periodical distribution work of some post offices has not yet improved, making it very difficult for readers to subscribe to newspapers. We have forwarded these letters to the relevant postal and telecommunications bureaus for handling. Today, we are publishing excerpts from these two letters, hoping to attract the attention of postal and telecommunications departments at all levels.

    为什么6月20日就不能订7月份报纸？
    6月间，我们单位由南京搬到大同市，同月20日，我们到大同邮局订第三季度的人民日报和红旗杂志，但邮局却以超过订期为理由，不给续订。因此，我们单位的很多同志就没有订到7月份的人民日报和红旗杂志。我们都是人民日报的老读者，一个月不能看到报纸，对党和政府的重要指示和文件以及国内外振奋人心的消息不能及时知道，这真是一个很大的损失！
    人民日报和红旗杂志是我们不可缺少的教科书。但是大同市邮局不从广大读者的需要和方便出发，还在坚守不合理的限期订阅报刊制度，这是不对的。我建议他们打破陈规旧制，按照一切为了方便读者的原则，改进报刊发行工作。

    编者按：今年3月间，全国十七位先进报刊发行工作者提出改进报刊发行工作“六比倡议”后，全国许多邮局改进报刊发行工作，做到随订随送。广大读者纷纷来信表示欢迎和表扬。但是，仍有不少读者来信反映：还有某些邮局的报刊发行工作仍然没有改进，使读者订报十分困难。我们已把这些来信转给有关邮电局处理。今天摘要发表这两篇来信，希望引起各级邮电部门注意。
