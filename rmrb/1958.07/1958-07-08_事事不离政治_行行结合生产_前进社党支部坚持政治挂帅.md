    Never Deviate from Politics in Any Matter, Combine Every Industry with Production
    The Qianjin Cooperative Party Branch Adheres to Putting Politics in Command
    (Our Newspaper Reporter Sun Yuchang reports) The Chinese Communist Party’s Qianjin Cooperative Branch in Hanyang County, Hubei Province, adheres to putting political and ideological work in command, continuously enhancing the socialist consciousness of the masses and developing production year after year. The branch truly plays a core leadership role.
    Never deviating from politics in any matter, combining every industry with production, and using politics to mobilize the masses and promote production are the characteristics of the political work of this cooperative's Party branch. Whether it involves key production issues affecting more than a thousand people in the cooperative, implementing national policies, or various ideological tendencies among the members, the Party branch mobilizes the masses to conduct debates through various opportunities, ensuring that members have consistent understanding, consistent action, and high spirits, and are full of energy. For example, when formulating the Great Leap Forward production plan this spring, people with conservative ideas showed strong resistance. Party member Chen Kaishuang did not advocate formulating a plan, privately saying that formulating a plan was "bragging" and that "the fields are not rubber, and increased production based on planning is unreliable." In response to this representative view, the Party branch first conducted debates within the Party, using the high-yield fact that Chen Kaijiang's experimental plot of six fen (a unit of land measurement) yielded 170 jin (a unit of weight measurement) of ginned cotton with very little fertilizer and only seven weeding sessions, to criticize Chen Kaishuang's erroneous ideas. It was also pointed out that as long as loopholes in high-yield fields are eliminated and the potential of low-yield fields is tapped, the production increase plan can be exceeded. Faced with the facts, Chen Kaishuang admitted his conservative ideas. On this basis, the branch also widely launched publicity and debates among the masses, and everyone realized that "success depends on human effort." Therefore, the branch's original plan was revised and improved by the masses.
    All twelve production teams in this cooperative have their own study classes, which are used as positions for socialist education. The branch often uses vivid forms of comparing the new and old societies, using revolutionary heroes like Xu Dama, Fang Heming, and negative examples of people taking the capitalist road like Li Zuoan and Liu Jiemei, who forgot their roots and turned back, to conduct class education, enlighten the socialist consciousness of Party members and the masses, so that the advanced become more advanced, and the backward catch up with the advanced. Zhan Rongchang, who was originally known as a "Mr. Nice Guy" and was consistently negative in his work, became a labor hero in his production team after repeated education.
    Due to the strict requirements and supervision of Party members both inside and outside the Party, and the sense of responsibility to be socialist leaders for the masses, no Party member dares to lag behind, everyone endures hardship first and enjoys benefits later, and always considers the interests of the masses. On the production front, all ten members of the branch are production team leaders who are highly trusted by the masses (four of whom are concurrently the branch secretary, cooperative director, etc.). They not only plan and organize production day and night but also participate in labor with the broad masses. Especially in the crucial moments of production and in the face of difficulties, Party members personally demonstrate and set examples, encouraging and motivating the masses. For example, the current drought is severe, and some people lack confidence in fighting the drought, but when they saw Party members leading the youth commando team to take the lead in treadling waterwheels to irrigate the fields, those who originally lacked confidence all automatically came to treadle waterwheels, ensuring a good rice harvest.
    The branch is also very concerned about the lives and hardships of the masses. The members of this cooperative do not have the habit of growing vegetables, and they lack non-staple foods all year round. To change this situation, the Party branch mobilized young people to build dikes around more than 20 mu (a unit of land measurement) of barren lake ponds, raising fish and planting lotus roots, so that members can eat some fresh fish or lotus roots every day. Branch committee members often visit the widowed, orphaned, and childless five-guarantee households to ask about their well-being, understand their difficulties, and help solve them. One stormy night, branch secretary Chen Kaijiang visited the elderly and childless Jiang Dapo and found that she was suffering from a sudden illness. Chen Kaijiang immediately braved the heavy rain to bring a doctor from several miles away to treat Jiang Dapo. Later, Jiang Dapo's married daughter learned about this and was very moved.
    The Party branch has consistently adhered to political and ideological work, creating unity within and outside the Party, and generating great material and spiritual strength. This strength has enabled the cooperative to win more grain from the land. Before 1954, it lacked more than 100,000 jin of grain every year. Since 1956, after the Party branch improved the political education system, it became an agricultural cooperative with a surplus of 150,000 jin of grain. This year, they will sell 250,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

    事事不离政治  行行结合生产
    前进社党支部坚持政治挂帅
    本报讯  记者孙玉昌报道：中共湖北汉阳县前进社支部坚持政治思想工作挂帅，使群众的社会主义觉悟不断提高，生产逐年发展。支部真正发挥了核心领导作用。
    事事不离政治，行行结合生产，用政治发动群众，推动生产，是这个社党支部政治工作的特点。不论是关系到全社一千多人的生产关键问题、贯彻国家政策或者是社员中出现的各种思想倾向，党支部都发动群众通过各种机会进行辩论，使社员认识一致，行动一致，精神愉快，干劲十足。如今春订生产跃进规划时，有保守思想的人抵触情绪很严重，党员陈开爽不主张订规划，私下说订规划是“说大话”，“田又不是橡皮，订了规划增产也是靠不住的。”党支部对这种有代表性的看法，首先在党内通过辩论，大家以陈开江用肥很少只是除了七次草，就使六分试验田收了一百七十斤皮棉的高产事实，批判了陈开爽的错误想法。并指出，只要高产田消灭漏洞、低产田挖掘潜力，就能超过增产规划。在事实面前，陈开爽承认了自己的保守思想。在此基础上，支部又广泛地在群众中展开了宣传和辩论，大家都认识到“事在人为”。因此，支部原订的规划也被群众修改提高了。
    这个社十二个生产队都有自己的学习班，当做社会主义教育的阵地。支部经常用新旧社会对比，用革命英雄人物徐大妈、方和明和走资本主义道路的李作安、忘本回头的刘介梅等好坏典型对比的生动活泼的形式，进行阶级教育，启发党员和群众的社会主义觉悟，使先进的更先进，后进的赶上先进。原来被称为“好好先生”的占荣昌，工作一贯消极，在多次教育之后，一跃而成了他所在生产队的劳动能手。
    由于党内外对党员的严格要求和监督，和要给群众作社会主义带头人的责任感，使党员人人不敢落后，个个都是吃苦在前得利在后，处处为群众利益着想。在生产战线上，支部全体十个党员都是被群众高度信任的生产队长（其中四名是由支书、社主任等兼任），他们不仅日夜筹划和组织生产，而且和广大群众一起参加劳动。尤其在生产的紧要关头和困难面前，党员都亲身示范作出榜样，激励并带动了群众。如目前旱象严重，部分群众对抗旱信心不足，但是当看到党员率领青年突击队带头车水灌田后，原来信心不足的人就全部自动地前来车水，使水稻丰收有了把握。
    对群众的生活疾苦，支部也很关心。这个社的社员没有种植蔬菜的习惯，常年缺乏副食品，为改变这种局面，党支部动员青年把二十多亩荒湖塘筑堤围水，养鱼种藕，使社员每天都能吃到一些鲜鱼或鲜藕。支部委员们经常到鳏寡孤独的五保户家去问寒问暖，了解困难帮助解决。在一个暴风雨的夜晚，支部书记陈开江到孤老蒋大婆家去串门，发现她患了急病，陈开江立刻冒倾盆大雨到数里外把医生接来给蒋大婆医病。事后蒋大婆出嫁了的女儿知道了，非常感动。
    党支部一贯坚持政治思想工作，造成了党内外的团结一致，产生了伟大的物质力量和精神力量。这力量使这个社向土地争得了更多的粮食，1954年以前每年缺粮十多万斤，从1956年党支部健全了政治教育制度以后，一跃而为有十五万斤余粮的农业社。今年他们将把二十五万斤的余粮卖给国家。
