Autumn Harvest Uprising and the Early Days of Our Army
    --Commemorating the 31st Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Marshal of the People's Republic of China Luo Ronghuan

    In 1927, the Great Revolution failed. The Chinese Communist Party independently led the people in armed struggles against the counter-revolution. The Nanchang Uprising was the Party's attempt, at this critical juncture, to oppose the counter-revolutionary massacre and salvage the revolution by launching an armed uprising. This uprising raised a clear banner of armed struggle for the people of the whole country. Following the August 7th Emergency Meeting of the Party Central Committee, Chen Duxiu's right-leaning capitulationism was resolutely corrected, and it was decided to carry out land revolution and armed resistance against the Kuomintang's policy of massacre, launching Autumn Harvest Uprisings in various regions to strike at the counter-revolutionary armed offensive.

    At that time, in the southern provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, the peasant movement flourished during the high tide of the Great Revolution. Peasants universally demanded land revolution, and in some areas, peasants even automatically confiscated the land of landlords. This powerful peasant movement not only frightened the Kuomintang reactionaries but also made the Chen Duxiu opportunists feel afraid. The Ma-Ri Incident in Changsha was the first knife the reactionaries plunged into the Hunan workers and peasants, and it was also a signal of the Wuhan government's betrayal. However, they had not yet had time to launch a comprehensive offensive against the peasant movements in various provinces. Therefore, the Party decided to first launch the Autumn Harvest Uprising in these provinces with a solid and broad base of peasant movements, and sent Comrade Mao Zedong to Hunan to lead the local uprising.

    Some of the troops that did not catch up with the Nanchang Uprising, as well as the troops scattered after the failure of Sanheba, retreated into the countryside in batches, promoted peasant armed uprisings in various places, and became the military backbone of the uprising. This enabled the Autumn Harvest Uprising to be launched more quickly, and rapidly formed an army with a certain combat capability, mainly because the Party was the inspirer and organizer of this army from the beginning.

        × × ×

    Special mention should be made of the main force of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, which was the troops gathered by Comrade Mao Zedong on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. The Guard Regiment of the former Fourth Group Army of the National Revolutionary Army was the backbone of this force. The rest were the peasant volunteer army of Pingjiang and Liuyang, the peasant self-defense army of Tongcheng and Chongyang, and the uprising peasants of Liling. The Guard Regiment was initially stationed in the county town of Xiushui under the name of the Provisional First Division of the Jiangxi Provincial Defense Army. Although there were many Party members in this unit, a strong organizational leadership had not been formed, and there was no clear program of action. Most of the military commanders were students of the Whampoa Military Academy. They were all intellectuals, had not experienced much actual war training, and had weak command capabilities. The old way of leading troops hindered unity between officers and soldiers. Due to the above reasons, the combat effectiveness of this unit was not strong.

    On September 8, 1927, the Autumn Harvest Uprising was launched. Under the slogan of "Third Attack on Changsha," the troops set off from Xiushui. The First Regiment took the route of Changshou Street, and the Third Regiment took the route of Dongmen City, hoping to meet the Second Regiment, which was heading north in Liuyang, and then attack Changsha. At that time, there was no widespread mobilization of the masses to win their cooperation, and it was actually just a simple military operation.

    Due to the rebellion of the Fourth Regiment under Qiu Guoxuan, which had been incorporated into the force, the Second Battalion of the First Regiment, which had no defense, was suddenly attacked on Changshou Street and completely defeated. The Third Regiment was also ambushed by superior enemies in Dongmen City, suffering heavy casualties. After occupying Liuyang City, the Second Regiment was surrounded by the enemy and suffered heavy losses in the breakout battle. Comrade Mao Zedong was detained by the enemy on his way from the Provincial Party Committee to Tonggu. Although he cleverly escaped later, the Autumn Harvest Uprising had already failed. He gathered the remnants in Wenjiashi, retreated south, and was ambushed again by the enemy in Luxi. The troops were left with less than a thousand people, and when they arrived in Sanwan, in the territory of Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, they immediately carried out reorganization.

    The first step was to reorganize the organization. A division was reduced to a regiment, renamed the First Regiment of the First Division of the First Army of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army, which actually only had two battalions and seven companies. After the reorganization, there was a surplus of cadres. Most of these cadres were intellectuals who had joined the army, and some of them were panicked and shaken in the face of this series of failures and this dangerous and arduous struggle. A few people (the original division and regimental commanders) had already left without saying goodbye. If the surplus cadres were not dealt with quickly, it would inevitably shake the morale of the army. Comrade Mao Zedong then took resolute measures, based on voluntary participation: those who wanted to stay would stay, and those who wanted to leave would be given five yuan for travel expenses and dispersed to the countryside. In this way, on the one hand, the troops were consolidated, and on the other hand, revolutionary seeds were spread. And those who stayed were firm revolutionaries who had been tested by battle and hardship. Although they were few in number, they were much more capable.

    Next, Comrade Mao Zedong began to establish Party organizations at all levels in the army: groups in platoons, branches in companies, and Party committees in battalions and regiments. Party representatives were set up at all levels above the company, and a Party "Front Committee" was established, with Comrade Mao Zedong serving as the secretary. Thus, this unit began to be completely under the absolute leadership of the Party, thereby ensuring the smooth completion of various reforms.

    In order to eliminate all the bad systems and habits of the old army, Comrade Mao Zedong resolutely took many revolutionary measures. For example, the Soldiers' Committee was created at this time. In order to oppose the old army's way of leading troops, realize political equality between officers and soldiers, and establish a new type of troop leadership, democratic reform was needed. The Soldiers' Committee was an organizational form for realizing democracy. At that time, the Soldiers' Committee had extremely high powers. Officers were supervised by the Soldiers' Committee, and if they did something wrong, they were subject to criticism and even sanctions by the Soldiers' Committee. It seemed that this relatively encouraged the ideas of extreme democratization and egalitarianism. But at that time, the main thing was to overturn the old army's way of leading troops and lay the foundation for a new type of officer-soldier relationship—class unity. Therefore, it was not a matter of preventing extreme democratization and egalitarianism. It could even be said that it was precisely using the peasants' ideological tendencies, "fighting poison with poison," to more thoroughly and effectively eliminate the remnants of warlordism. With democracy, the masses' awareness could be raised, and only then could a solid concentration be established. The peasants' egalitarian ideas were easy to overcome. I remember that at first, even an egg confiscated from the landlord had to be equally divided by the Soldiers' Committee. Later, because the cadres always set an example, their style was democratic, and the soldiers were moved. They also learned from practice that absolute equality was impossible and that there was no benefit in doing so, so they gradually changed, cherished the cadres, and obeyed orders on a conscious basis. Measures to improve officer-soldier relations were implemented in all aspects and were also reflected in changes in material treatment. Before the Autumn Harvest Uprising, officers had four dishes and a soup for each meal, which was very different from the treatment of soldiers. After the Sanwan Reorganization, because of the arduousness of the struggle, what was most needed at that time was for officers and soldiers to share weal and woe, so the treatment was changed to be completely the same. Cadres and soldiers ate the same food and wore the same clothes. This was a remarkable reform that further strengthened the links between officers and soldiers and played an active role in the testing and transformation of cadres. Of course, today's conditions are different. Our army has progressed from a low-level stage to a high-level stage, officers are professionalized and are developing towards greater specialization, and soldiers have changed from volunteer soldiers to conscripts. Thus, there are some not-too-disparate differences in living treatment between officers and soldiers and between superiors and subordinates, which is reasonable and necessary.

    The Sanwan Reorganization was actually the rebirth of our army. It was from this time that the Party's leadership over the army was established. At that time, if Comrade Mao Zedong had not wisely solved this fundamental problem first, then this unit would never have had a political soul, would never have had a clear program of action, and the habits of the old-style army and the free and undisciplined style of the peasants could not have been transformed. As a result, even if it was not destroyed by the powerful enemy, it could only have become bandits. Of course, the Sanwan Reorganization only laid the foundation for a new type of revolutionary army in terms of organization. Political and ideological transformation was still a long-term struggle.

            × × ×

    In early October of that year, Comrade Mao Zedong led the troops in the direction of Suichuan. At that time, the weather was gradually getting colder, the soldiers were still wearing ragged single clothes, supplies were very difficult, and they had not yet had a chance to rest temporarily. However, because the Party had carried out work in the army, the morale of the soldiers was still high. After an extremely tiring march, they went around posting notices to the people, publicizing what kind of army we were.

    There is a town called Dafen in southern Suichuan. In order to solve the problem of winter clothes and supplies for the troops, we moved into this town. Before deciding on the next step, we were suddenly attacked by the "Aihu Tuan" (local militia). Because the troops were unprepared and responded hastily, they had to disperse and retreat. At that time, a platoon of the Fourth Company, following Comrade Mao Zedong, ran all the way to Wang'ao, stopped, gathered the scattered personnel, and took on the task of covering the assembly of the First Battalion. At this time, the Third Battalion had withdrawn in the direction of Guidong, Hunan.

    A total of twenty or so people were left in the Fourth Company, scattered sparsely on the ground. To cook rice, the cooking gear had also been lost. Hungry, they had to find some leftovers, pickles, and chili peppers from the people's homes. Without bowls and chopsticks, Comrade Mao Zedong and everyone else reached into the rice basket and grabbed the food with their hands.

    After everyone was full, Comrade Mao Zedong stood up, took a few steps towards the open space in the middle, stood with his feet together, his body straight, and said spiritedly to everyone: "Now, let's line up! I'll stand first, please ask Company Commander Zeng to give the commands!" His strong and calm spirit immediately and powerfully infected the soldiers. They all raised their heads, mustered the courage to fight, and stood up full of confidence, taking aim at his tall figure. Then the First Battalion caught up, and the team headed for Jinggang Mountain. The Third Battalion withdrew to the Guidong area of ​​southern Hunan and eventually reunited with us when we withdrew from Chaling.

    When the troops arrived in Jinggang Mountain, they immediately began to carry out land reform in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, striving to create a political power in the central section of the Luoxiao Mountains. Due to the uneven development of the revolution, during the low tide of the revolution, we retreated in total strength, but in the rural areas of Jinggang Mountain on the border of Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, where the counter-revolutionary ruling forces were relatively weak, we launched guerrilla warfare, overthrew local tyrants, distributed land, and established small base areas. In this way, the retreat of the cities was covered. Later, many Party cadres were sent to the guerrilla base areas and to the armed forces to preserve them. However, from the perspective of developing rural base areas, striving to encircle the cities from the countryside, and then seize the cities, it was a long-term and arduous struggle. Marching to Jinggang Mountain was only a stage of initial preparation. Because what we controlled were only scattered rural positions, and they were also not consolidated or connected, far from forming an encirclement of the cities.

    The slogan "The army is a fighting force and a working force" was put forward at this time. This slogan embodies the close combination and mutual interaction of military activities and political work; it also shows that only in the actual and acute class struggle can the military and political qualities of the troops be improved.

    At that time, the troops, on the one hand, implemented armed separation, actively attacking the enemy when advancing; on the other hand, they maneuvered and concealed themselves when retreating, avoiding fighting uncertain battles, and waiting for opportunities to prepare for the next attack on the counter-revolution. Every time they arrived in a place, every time they finished a battle, they were dispersed into units of platoons and groups, and went to various villages to mobilize the masses, fight local tyrants, divide land, and establish peasant associations. The areas of Ninggang, Yongxin, Suichuan, Chaling, and Taihe were gradually established as red political power in this way, becoming revolutionary base areas. In this way, not only were the troops educated and trained, but also the relationship between the army and the people was further strengthened. After fighting Chaling and returning to Jinggang Mountain, Comrade Mao Zedong further personally formulated the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," fixing in the most specific and essential language how revolutionary soldiers should treat the masses of the people. For many years, it has been guiding the actions of every commander and fighter.

    Democratic reform continued within the troops. The Party organizations at all levels and the system of Party representatives were affirmed, political departments at all levels were also established, the Soldiers' Committees were more universally established, and they played an active role. Officers and soldiers truly shared weal and woe. Replenishing clothing was always done for the soldiers first and then for the cadres. If a cadre had a new piece of clothing alone, he would wash it before wearing it, otherwise he would feel uncomfortable. At that time, the main cadres of the company all had horses, but no one rode them. They were used to carry wounded soldiers during battles and sick soldiers during peacetime. The internal transformation struggle of the troops was relatively long-term. This was because all the bad habits and bad styles of the old army were constantly reflected through the supplemented prisoners; at the same time, the peasants who joined the army brought with them freedom, laxity, conservatism, and backwardness. Therefore, it was necessary to constantly fight against the invasion of this old habit and old style.

    Through this constant and profound internal and external struggle, the troops truly achieved the degree of "unity between the army and the people, unity between officers and soldiers," their political morale was high, and there were very few desertions. I remember this story: Comrade Mao Zedong once led the Third Battalion of the Thirty-first Regiment down the mountain to meet the Twenty-eighth Regiment returning to Jinggang Mountain from southern Hunan. At night, while passing through the Guidong area, they were attacked by the enemy, and the troops were scattered at the time. Everyone was very anxious. But when they gathered the next morning, only one stretcher bearer was missing. Who knew that when everyone returned to Jinggang Mountain, this stretcher bearer had already returned.

              × × ×

    The Autumn Harvest Uprising was a turning point in the history of the Chinese revolution, opening up the path for the Chinese revolution to move forward. This is the only correct path: advance into the countryside, rely on the countryside to establish revolutionary base areas, thereby accumulate and develop revolutionary forces, gradually encircle the cities, and finally seize the cities.

    Comrade Mao Zedong was the first to correctly solve the revolutionary strategic problem of relying on the countryside to persist in long-term guerrilla warfare in action. – Unfurl the banner of armed struggle, carry out land revolution under the support of arms, which made the broad masses of peasants lean towards us; without arms, we cannot carry out effective land revolution. However, if armed forces are not combined with land revolution, and land revolution is not the content of armed struggle, then having armed forces will also lead to failure. On the other hand, without building base areas, armed forces cannot take root in the masses, and they are easily subject to enemy attacks and fail. The combination of revolutionary armed forces, land revolution, and revolutionary base areas is the core of Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary strategic thinking at that time.

    In terms of the construction of the revolutionary army, the troops of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, under the personal cultivation of Comrade Mao Zedong, also created countless brilliant experiences. For example, an armed uprising, on the one hand, must rely on the broad masses of peasants, and on the other hand, it must have a part of the regular army with revolutionary consciousness as the backbone; otherwise, the uprising will not be easy to launch, and even if it is launched, it will not be easy to form combat effectiveness.

    However, without the leadership of the Party, even if there are a large number of uprising peasants and military backbones, the troops still have no soul. Without political transformation, the peasants who rise up lack organization and discipline, and they collapse at the first touch; without political transformation, military backbones cannot simultaneously be political backbones, and their role as military backbones cannot be brought into play. The Party has always been the leader, organizer, and inspirer of the army. Without the leadership of the Party, there would be no revolutionary army. Separated from the Party, everything will fail. The entire history of our army fully proves this truth. In history, there have been countless vacillations regarding the Party's collective leadership system, and each vacillation has caused the troops to suffer temporary political losses. These lessons are extremely profound. The important historical significance of the Sanwan Reorganization lies in the fact that it was from this time that the Party's absolute leadership over the army was established, laying the organizational foundation for a new type of revolutionary army. Later, it was under the guarantee of this foundation that the remaining habits of the old-style army were continued to be eliminated from the political and ideological aspects, and a more complete and rich organization, system, and style of the revolutionary army were established and formed. Comrade Mao Zedong's systematic thinking on army building was also gradually completed through practice during this period. For example, the policy of treating prisoners, the policy of establishing a united front with all forces that can be united (transforming Wang Zuo's troops is actually a kind of united front work), the urban policy, etc., were all put forward or initially formed during this period. When the Ninth Party Congress of the Fourth Red Army was held in Gutian, Comrade Mao Zedong's set of experiences in army building was basically summarized, which became the glorious tradition of the people's army. For the past thirty years, it has had an extremely profound and far-reaching impact on the revolutionary war and the construction of the army.

    秋收起义与我军初创时期
    ——纪念中国人民解放军建军三十一周年
    中华人民共和国元帅　罗荣桓
    1927年，大革命失败，中国共产党独立地领导人民，向反革命进行了武装斗争。南昌起义就是党在这危急关头，以武装起义来反对反革命的屠杀而挽救革命失败的尝试，这个起义向全国人民树立了一面鲜明的武装斗争的旗帜。接着八七党中央紧急会议，坚决地纠正了陈独秀的右倾投降主义，决定进行土地革命和武装反抗国民党屠杀政策，在各地发动秋收起义，打击反人民武装的进攻。
    当时，南方的湖南、湖北、广东、江西等省，在大革命的高潮中，农民运动蓬勃发展，农民们普遍要求进行土地革命，有些地区甚至发生了农民自动没收地主土地的斗争。这种声势浩大的农民运动，不仅吓坏了国民党反动派，也使陈独秀机会主义分子们感到害怕。长沙的马日事变，就是反动派向湖南工农群众杀来的第一刀，也是武汉政府叛变的信号。可是，当时他们还没有来得及对各省的农民运动进行全面的进攻。党于是决定首先在这些有着雄厚、广大的农民运动基础的省份，发动秋收起义，并且派毛泽东同志到湖南去领导当地的起义。
    未赶上南昌起义行动的一部分部队，以及三河坝失败以后散失的部队，分批地退入了农村，推动了各地农民武装起义，并成为起义中的军事骨干。这就使秋收起义能够更加迅速地发动，并且迅速地形成了具有一定战斗能力的军队，当然主要在于党一开始就是这一军队的鼓舞者和组织者。
        ×　×　×
    应该特别提到秋收起义中主要的一支部队，这就是毛泽东同志在湘、鄂、赣三省边境收集起来的部队。原国民革命军第四集团军的警卫团是这支部队的骨干，其余的就是平江、浏阳的农民义勇军，通城、崇阳的农民自卫军，以及醴陵的起义农民。警卫团开始以江西省防军暂编第一师的名义，驻扎在修水县城。这支部队中，虽然有不少党员，但并没有形成坚强的组织领导，也没有明确的行动纲领，军事指挥员大部分是黄埔军校的学生，他们都是知识分子，没有经过更多实际战争的锻炼，指挥能力较弱。旧的一套带兵方法，妨碍着上下一致、官兵一致。由于上述原因，这支部队的战斗力并不强。
    1927年9月8日，发动了秋收起义，在“第三次攻打长沙”的口号下，部队从修水出发，一团取道长寿街，三团取道东门市，要想在浏阳与北上的二团会合后，进攻长沙。当时并没有广泛地发动群众，争取群众的配合，实际上只是一种单纯的军事行动。
    由于收编的第四团丘国轩匪部叛变，毫无防范的一团二营，在长寿街受到突然袭击，二营全被打垮；三团在东门市也受到优势敌人的伏击，伤亡较大；二团占领浏阳城后，被敌人包围，在突围战斗中损失殆尽。毛泽东同志在从省委去铜鼓的路上，被敌人扣留，后来虽然机智地脱了险，但秋收起义已经失败了。他在文家市收集了残部，向南退却，在卢溪又受到敌人的伏击，部队一共剩下不到一千人，到达江西永新县境的三湾，便立刻进行整顿。
    首先是整顿组织，一个师缩编成一个团，改称为工农革命军第一军第一师第一团，实际上只有两个营七个连。整编后，干部多余了。这些干部，大多是投笔从戎的知识分子，其中有些人在这一连串的失败面前，在这危险、艰苦的斗争面前，惊慌失措、灰心动摇起来，少数人（原来的师、团长）已经不告而别了。如果不迅速地处理多余干部，势必会动摇军心。毛泽东同志于是采取了坚决的措施，根据自愿，要留则留，要走的就发给五块钱路费，疏散到农村去，这样一方面巩固了部队，另一方面也散布了革命种子。而留下来的，都是经过战斗和艰苦生活考验的坚定的革命者，人虽少，却精悍得多。
    接着，毛泽东同志开始在部队中建立党的各级组织，班有小组，连有支部，营团有党委，在连以上各级设置党代表，并且成立了党的“前敌委员会”，毛泽东同志担任书记。于是，这支部队便开始完全处在党的绝对领导之下，从而保证了各方面改革工作的顺利完成。
    为了扫清旧军队的一切不良制度和习气，毛泽东同志果断地采取了许多革命的措施。例如，士兵委员会就是这时候产生的。为了反对旧军队的一套带兵方法，实现政治上的官兵平等，建立新式的带兵方法，这就需要进行民主改革。士兵委员会就是实现民主的一个组织形式。那时，士兵委员会有极高的权力，军官受士兵委员会的监督，做错了事，要受士兵委员会的批评，甚至制裁。看来，这样做似乎相对地鼓励了极端民主化和平均主义的思想。但当时主要是要反掉旧军队的一套带兵方法，奠定新型的官兵关系——阶级的团结，因而，就不是防止什么极端民主化和平均主义的问题，甚至可以说，正是利用了农民的这种思想倾向，“以毒攻毒”，更彻底更有效地肃清了军阀残余。有了民主，才能提高群众觉悟，这才能建立巩固的集中。农民的平均主义思想是容易克服的。记得，起初甚至没收地主来的一个鸡蛋，也要由士兵委员会来平分。后来由于干部处处以身作则，作风民主，士兵受到感动，他们从实践中也知道了无法绝对平均，觉得那样做没有什么好处，便逐渐改变过来，在自觉的基础上爱护干部、听从指挥了。改善官兵关系的措施，贯彻到各个方面，也表现在物质待遇的变化上。秋收起义以前，军官每顿饭都是四菜一汤，和士兵的待遇很悬殊。三湾改编以后，因为斗争的艰苦性，那时最需要的是官兵甘苦与共，因而待遇改成完全一致，干部和士兵吃一样的饭菜、穿一样的衣服。这是一个了不起的改革，更加密切了官兵生活的联系，对干部的考验和改造，也起了积极的作用。当然，今天的条件已经不同，我军已由低级阶段进到高级阶段，军官职业化，并且更向专业化发展，士兵则已由志愿兵改成义务兵，从而官兵之间、上下级之间的生活待遇上，有某些不太悬殊的差别，这是合理的，也是必要的。
    三湾改编，实际上是我军的新生，正是从这时开始，确立了党对军队的领导。当时，如果不是毛泽东同志英明地最先解决了这个根本性的问题，那么，这支部队便始终不会有政治灵魂，始终不会有明确的行动纲领，旧式军队的习气、农民的自由散漫作风，都不可能得到改造，其结果即使不被强大的敌人消灭，也只能变成流寇。当然，三湾改编也只是从组织上奠定了新型的革命军队的基础，政治上思想上的改造，还是一个长期斗争的过程。
            ×　×　×
    当年10月初，毛泽东同志带领部队向遂川方向行进。那时，天气已经逐渐寒冷，战士们还是穿着破烂的单衣，给养十分困难，并且还未获得暂时休整机会。可是由于党在部队中进行了工作，战士们情绪仍然高涨，在极度疲劳的行军以后，还去四处张贴布告，向老百姓宣传我们是什么军队。
    遂川南有个市镇，名叫大汾。为了解决部队的冬衣和给养，我们便进驻这一市镇。尚未决定下一步行动时，就遭到“挨户团”的突然袭击。部队因毫无准备，仓促应战，只好分散撤退。当时四连有一个排，随着毛泽东同志一气跑到王坳，便停下来，收集失散人员，并担负掩护一营集结的任务。这时，三营已向湖南桂东方向撤走了。
    四连一共剩下二十多个人，稀稀落落地散坐在地上。要煮饭吃，炊事担子也跑丢了，肚子饿了，只好向老百姓家里找一点剩饭和泡菜辣椒。没有碗筷，毛泽东同志和大家一起，伸手就从饭箩里抓着吃。
    等大家吃饱了，毛泽东同志站起身，朝中间空地迈了几步，双足并拢，身体笔挺，精神抖擞地对大家说：“现在来站队！我站第一名，请曾连长喊口令！”他的坚强、镇定的精神，立刻强有力地感染了战士们。他们一个个都抬起头来，鼓起战斗的勇气，充满信心，提着枪就站起队来，向着他那高大的身躯看齐。接着一营就赶上了，队伍向井冈山进发。三营撤退到湘南桂东一带活动，在后来，我们从茶陵退出时，也终于会合了。
    部队开到井冈山，立即遵照毛泽东同志的指示，开始进行土地改革，争取创造罗霄山脉中段政权。由于革命发展不平衡，在革命的低潮时期革命力量总退却的时期我们却在反革命统治力量较薄弱的赣、湘两省边境的井冈山农村，展开了游击战，打倒土豪，分配土地，建立小块根据地。这样，便掩护了城市的退却。后来，有许多党的干部，被送到游击根据地来、送到武装部队中来保存。但是，从发展农村根据地、争取以农村包围城市、从而夺取城市的新的战略任务来说，是一个长期的艰巨的斗争，向井冈山进军，还仅仅是一个开始准备的阶段。因为我们控制的只是零星的农村阵地，同时也还不巩固、不联贯，远不能形成对城市的包围。
    军队是战斗队又是工作队的口号，就是在这时候提出来的。这句口号体现了军事活动与政治工作的密切结合、互相作用的关系；也说明了只有在实际的尖锐的阶级斗争中，才能提高部队的军事、政治素质。
    那时候，部队一方面实行武装割据，进则主动打击敌人；退则周旋隐蔽，避免打无把握的仗，等待时机，准备下一次打击反革命。每到达一地，每打完一仗，都要分散到以班、组为单位，到各村去发动群众，打土豪，分田地，建立农会。宁冈、永新、遂川、茶陵、泰和一带，都是这样地逐步建立了红色政权，成了革命根据地。这样，不但教育、锻炼了部队，也进一步密切了军民关系。打茶陵回井冈山后，毛泽东同志更手订了“三大纪律，八项注意”，将革命军人如何对待人民群众，用最具体、最精要的语言固定下来，多少年来，一直指导着每一个指战员的行动。
    部队内部继续进行着民主改革。各级党的组织、党代表制肯定下来了，各级政治部也成立起来了，士兵委员会更普遍建立，并起着积极的作用。官兵真正做到同甘共苦，补充服装总是先士兵后干部，如果干部单独有件新衣服，也要洗一水才穿，否则就觉得身上不舒服。当时连的主要干部都有马，但谁都不骑，打仗时用来驮伤兵，平时用来驮病号。部队内部改造斗争是比较长期的，这是因为旧军队的一切坏习气坏作风，还不断通过补充的俘虏反映出来；同时，源源而来的参军农民，也带来了自由散漫、保守落后的东西。因此，经常要和这种旧习气旧作风的侵袭作斗争。
    经过这种经常的、深刻的内部和外部的斗争，部队真正达到了“军民一致、官兵一致”的程度，政治情绪高涨，极少有开小差的事情发生。记得这样一个故事：毛泽东同志曾带领三十一团的三营，下山去接应二十八团由湘南返回井冈山。夜间通过桂东地区，遭到敌人袭击，部队当时被打散了，大家很着急。但第二天清晨一集合，只少了一个担架兵。谁知当大家回到井冈山上时，这个担架兵却早已回来了。

    秋收起义是中国革命历史中的一个转折点，开辟了中国革命前进的道路。这就是向农村进军，依靠农村建立革命根据地，借此积蓄和发展革命力量，逐渐包围城市并最后夺取城市的唯一正确的道路。
    毛泽东同志最先从行动中正确地解决了依靠农村坚持长期游击战争的革命战略问题。——揭起武装斗争的大旗，在武装的支持下，进行土地革命，这就使广大农民群众靠拢了我们；没有武装，便不能进行有效的土地革命。但是，假如武装不和土地革命结合，不是以土地革命为武装斗争的内容，那么有了武装也会陷于失败。另方面，不建设根据地，武装便不能在群众中生根立足，便容易受到敌人的袭击而失败。革命武装、土地革命、革命根据地，这三者的结合，就是当时毛泽东同志革命战略思想的中心。
  在革命军队的建设方面，秋收起义的部队，在毛泽东同志的亲自培育下，也创立了无数辉煌的经验。例如，武装起义，一方面必须依靠广大的农民群众，另一方面，又必须有一部分有革命觉悟的正规军队作为骨干，否则起义便不易发动，发动起来，也不易于形成战斗力。
    但是，如果没有党的领导，即使有了大量的起义农民，有了军事骨干，部队还是没有灵魂。不经过政治改造，起义的农民缺乏组织性纪律性，一触即溃；不经过政治改造，军事骨干不能同时是政治上的骨干，其军事骨干的作用就不能发挥。党始终是军队的领导者、组织者和鼓舞者，没有党的领导，就没有革命的军队。离开了党，一切都要失败。我军的整个历史，都充分地证明了这个真理。历史上对于党的集体领导制，曾经发生过无数次动摇，每一次动摇，都曾使部队在政治上受到暂时的若干损失。这些教训都是极为深刻的。三湾改编的重要历史意义，就在于正是从这时开始，确定了党对军队的绝对领导，从组织上奠定了新型的革命军队的基础。后来，就是在这个基础的保证下，继续从政治、思想方面肃清旧式军队的残余习气，建立了和形成了更加完整、丰富的革命军队的组织、制度和作风。毛泽东同志的系统的建军思想，也正是在这个时期，通过实践逐步完成的。例如，对待俘虏的政策，与一切可以团结的力量建立统一战线的政策（改造王佐部队，实际上就是一种统一战线的工作）、城市政策等等，都是在这时期提出或者初步形成的。到红四军九次党代表大会在古田召开，毛泽东同志建军的一套经验，便基本总结起来，这就成了人民军队的光荣传统，三十年来，一直对革命战争和军队的建设起着极其深刻久远的影响。
