    On the Outpost Battlefield
    Chen Jun

    The German Democratic Republic is the western outpost of the socialist camp. One cannot fully appreciate its significance without visiting the GDR. Is it simply because the GDR borders the imperialist camp? No, if that were the case, several other fraternal countries share a border with the imperialist camp on their western frontiers. However, once you arrive in the GDR, you will feel every day how resolutely and gloriously the GDR is guarding the gate of the socialist camp.

    Here, it was originally one country, but it has been brutally divided by the U.S. imperialism and the Adenauer militarist reactionary clique. In the thirteen years since the war, East and West Germany have established two countries with completely different social systems. The struggle between two systems, two camps, and two classes is bound to be even more acute and intense in a country with an open border. In Berlin, you can see tens of thousands of people coming and going between the two countries every day, from the sky, the ground, and underground. They are compatriots, friends, and relatives, with countless ties. However, they live under two systems. Socialism and capitalism compete here every day, and every policy decision, down to the smallest measure, receives a strong reaction, influencing the direction of people's hearts. Imperialism is taking advantage of every condition, openly and secretly, to attack the socialist system and the GDR. West German newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and television programs spread rumors and slander every day, disseminating bourgeois ideology. Hundreds of spy agencies are engaged in conspiracies. U.S. imperialism, in order to dress up this capitalist showcase, spares no expense in embellishing a false façade of prosperity. The monopoly capitalists who fled to West Germany are still paying pensions to the former workers of factories in the former territory of East Germany in West Berlin. A so-called "softening policy" is adopted towards intellectuals, enticing them to "escape" to West Germany, and using the American way of life to lure young people with weak wills. Here, religion has also become a vicious tool of imperialism. The imperialists buy off pastors, organize them to visit West Germany, and send money and goods to believers by parcel post. Imperialists are doing everything possible to undermine all the policies of the GDR, hindering farmers from joining cooperatives, recruiting skilled workers at high prices, instigating intellectuals to reject socialist ideological transformation, spreading rumors, inciting backward masses to be dissatisfied with the Party and the government, and alienating the masses from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and the government, attempting to realize the U.S. imperialism and Adenauer's delusional ambition to annex the GDR by force. However, all the imperialists' conspiracies and tricks are in vain. The GDR is growing stronger and stronger in the struggle.

    Everyone knows that the GDR's material foundation is originally in a disadvantageous position compared to West Germany. 80% of Germany's past industry was in West Germany, West Germany is more than twice the size of the GDR, and its population is more than 30 million more. However, in the thirteen years since then, the socialist construction of the GDR has achieved great success. Electricity per capita is already the highest in Europe, the machinery industry is second only to the Soviet Union, brown coal production is the first in the world, and the chemical, optical, and electrical industries all have their own characteristics. In the first quarter of this year, there was a good situation of overfulfilling the plan for the first time in history. At present, the ratio of total industrial output value to total agricultural and forestry output value has reached eighty-six to fourteen. Since October 1957, the agricultural cooperativization movement has developed rapidly. The average yield per unit area of cooperatives has exceeded that of individual farmers, and the yield per unit area of wheat has exceeded that of West Germany, and efforts are being made to surpass West Germany in all agricultural products by 1960. In terms of cultural and educational undertakings, it has long been ahead of West Germany. In 1956, the number of university students per million residents in the GDR was 4,950, while in West Germany it was only 2,550. There are 6,000 university students studying agriculture in East Germany, and only 600 in West Germany, but what these 600 people can do after graduation is still uncertain. Not to mention that West Germany is full of American decadent and corrupt lifestyle and ideology, and rejects German national culture. And what is especially worth reporting to the readers is that since the 30th Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in 1957, remarkable achievements have been made in political and ideological work. Wherever you go, the Party committee secretary of the factory, the county committee secretary, the director of the tractor station, the person in charge of the school party... in their conversations, they will tell you the same conclusion, that the reason why significant achievements have been made in all aspects in the past two years is because the Party has strengthened its political and ideological work.

    The Hans Beimler Electrical Locomotive Factory is carrying out a "Lodewig Movement." This is a mass movement to improve labor productivity and revise quotas. Lodewig is a turner, and his slogan is: to act like a true socialist worker. He studies technology, improves labor productivity, and voluntarily proposes to revise quotas, without taking excessive bonus wages. Under his influence, workers have broken conservative thinking and exchanged technical experience, making the entire workshop's production look new. The Party organization seized this typical example, launched socialist education in the factory, explained the significance of overfulfilling the plan and improving labor productivity for consolidating the GDR and strengthening the socialist camp, and called for the "Lodewig Movement" to be launched in order to welcome the Fifth National Congress of the Socialist Unity Party. By the end of May, 850 people had improved their technology and revised their quotas. Preliminary calculations show that 850 workers can save the state 200,000 marks per year. By the end of this year, they will strive to have 2,000 people become "Lodewig Movement" participants. Party Committee Secretary Steinbach told reporters: "To effectively improve workers' socialist consciousness, we must combine ideological and political work with practice." In this factory, the Party organization often holds discussions with workers to explain the Party's various policies. Sometimes, question-and-answer sessions are held where workers can raise various questions, which are answered by the Party organization. Many young workers grew up in socialist society and do not understand what capitalism is. They often feel dissatisfied when they see that the GDR's high-end consumer goods are not as numerous as those displayed in West German shop windows. The Party organization repeatedly educates young workers, exposing the truth about West Germany, explaining that the GDR's industrial base is poor and that production is developing under unfavorable conditions, but that these difficulties can be overcome, and the great achievements already made by the GDR are proof of this. These issues are also frequently discussed with workers in the factory's newspaper. The strengthening of ideological work has powerfully promoted the factory's production this year.

    In Ballow County, Comrade Heller, the Second Secretary of the County Committee, enthusiastically introduced the development of agricultural cooperativization in the county to reporters. The land area participating in cooperatives in this county has reached 49% of the county's arable land (34% nationwide), and they will strive to reach 90% by 1960. The reason why the cooperativization movement has developed rapidly in the past six months is due to the extensive socialist education conducted among Party members and farmers in rural areas. Party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead and concentrated their efforts on carrying out the agricultural cooperativization movement. The County Committee summarized and promoted the "Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow" exhibition held in the village of Golzow, using the comparison of the village's past, present, and future, and the prospects for development, to illustrate the superiority of the socialist system and the benefits brought by agricultural cooperativization. Within the Party, a universal education in dialectical materialism was carried out, and all branches reviewed their attitude towards socialism in light of the county's actual situation. This extensive socialist education powerfully promoted the agricultural cooperativization movement throughout the county.

    New atmospheres have also emerged in the cultural and educational spheres. During the two anti-Soviet and anti-communist upsurges launched by imperialism in 1953 and 1956, especially after the Hungarian Incident, there was also a period of ideological confusion in the cultural and educational spheres of the GDR. All kinds of revisionist and bourgeois ideas emerged. Some advocated "no interference by the Party and the government in cultural undertakings," "requiring professors to lecture independently and responsibly," spreading the rhetoric of "freedom" and "democracy," opposing the study of Marxism-Leninism and dialectical materialism, and so on. The 30th Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in January 1957 emphasized strengthening ideological work in the cultural and educational fields, and proposed "no peaceful coexistence in ideology." Subsequently, the Party criticized some newspapers and magazines that spread revisionism, refuted some professors' revisionist fallacies in political economics, philosophy, history, education, and other fields, and extensively organized discussions on the Hungarian Incident among intellectuals to draw lessons from it. For more than a year, the Party Central Committee has firmly grasped the key link of political and ideological work. It has successively convened cultural conferences and higher education conferences to discuss the socialist transformation of the literary and art circles and the educational circles. From the central government to the districts and counties, plans and measures for developing socialist culture and science have been discussed. The Party transferred outstanding cadres to strengthen the Party's leadership in institutions of higher learning, criticized the idea of stressing professional work while neglecting politics in school education, clearly put forward the task of institutions of higher learning to cultivate socialist intellectuals, emphasized the study of Marxism-Leninism and dialectical materialism, and made it the basis of all teaching and research work. The leadership of institutions of higher learning has begun to change the old tradition of professors deciding everything, established school affairs committees and department affairs committees, implemented collective leadership, and absorbed lecturers, teaching assistants, and students to discuss and improve teaching work, and the political atmosphere among students has become stronger.

    Because the German Democratic Republic has strengthened its political and ideological work, opposed revisionism and bourgeois ideology, and conducted relatively systematic education on the struggle between two roads, on German reunification, and on dialectical materialism, the socialist consciousness of the people has been universally enhanced, thereby also stimulating and encouraging the enthusiasm and initiative for building socialism. The upcoming Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany will surely lead the people of the whole country to a new upsurge in socialist construction and to a new victory in the struggle against imperialism.

    在前哨的阵地上
    陈浚
    德意志民主共和国是社会主义阵营在西方的前哨。不到民主德国，是很难体会到它的全部意义的。仅仅是由于民主德国同帝国主义阵营接壤吗？不，如果是那样的话，在西部国界上同帝国主义阵营相接的还有好几个兄弟国家。不过，只要你一到民主德国，那末你就会天天感觉到：民主德国是怎样坚强而光荣地守卫着社会主义阵营的大门。
    这里，本来是一个国家，但是活生生地被美帝国主义和阿登纳军国主义反动集团割裂了。战后十三年以来，东德和西德建立了两个社会制度完全不同的国家。两个制度、两个阵营、两个阶级的斗争，在一个边界开放的国家里，势必更加尖锐和紧张。在柏林可以看到成千成万的人，从天上、从地面、从地下，天天来往于两个国家之间，他们是同胞，是朋友，是亲戚，有着千丝万缕的联系。可是，他们却又生活在两个制度之下。社会主义同资本主义在这里天天比赛着，每一个政策的决定，直到微小的措施，在这里都会得到强烈的反应，影响人心的向背。而帝国主义却又在利用着一切条件，明里暗地向社会主义制度、向民主德国进攻。西德的报纸、杂志、广播电台、电视节目，天天造谣污蔑，传播资产阶级思想。数以百计的特务机关，进行着阴谋活动。美帝国主义为了打扮这一个资本主义的橱窗，不惜工本地来粉饰虚假的市面繁荣。逃亡在西德的垄断资本家，到现在还在西柏林给过去东德境内工厂的老工人发养老金。对知识分子采取了所谓“软化政策”，诱骗知识分子“逃亡”西德，用美国的生活方式勾引意志薄弱的青年。在这里，宗教也成为帝国主义的凶恶工具，帝国主义者收买牧师，组织他们去西德参观，把钱物用邮包寄给教徒。帝国主义者对于民主德国的一切政策，千方百计地进行破坏，阻挠农民加入合作社，高价招收技术工人，挑拨知识分子拒绝社会主义思想改造，散布谣言，煽动落后群众对党和政府不满，离间人民群众同德国统一社会党和政府的关系，企图实现美帝国主义和阿登纳用实力政策吞并民主德国的妄想。但是，帝国主义者的一切阴谋诡计，都是枉费心机。民主德国在斗争里日益强大起来。
    谁都知道，民主德国的物质基础，比起西德来，原是处于不利的地位。德国过去的工业80％在西德，西德的面积比民主德国大一倍多，人口也多三千多万。但是，十三年以来，民主德国的社会主义建设获得了巨大的成就。电力按照人口平均已居于欧洲第一位，机械工业仅次于苏联，褐煤的产量占世界第一，航空工业超过了西德，化学、光学、电器工业，都有它的特色。今年第一季度，出现了有史以来第一次超额完成计划的良好情况。目前，工业同农林业总产值的比例，已经达到八十六比十四。农业合作化运动，1957年10月以来，有了较快的发展，合作社的平均单位面积产量，已经超过了个体农民，小麦的单位面积产量已经超过了西德，并且正在努力争取到1960年使全部农产品赶过西德。文化教育事业方面，早已走在西德前面。1956年，一百万居民中大学生的数目，民主德国是四千九百五十人，而西德只有二千五百五十人。学农业的大学生，东德有六千人，西德只有六百人，可是这六百人毕业以后能做什么，还无着落。更不用说西德充斥着美国堕落腐化的生活方式和思潮，排斥德国民族文化了。而尤其值得向读者报告的，是从1957年德国统一社会党三十中全会以来，在政治思想工作方面取得了卓越的成就。无论你到哪里，工厂的党委书记、县委书记、拖拉机站的站长、学校党的负责人……，他们在谈话中，都会告诉你同样的一个结论，就是两年来所以能在各方面都取得显著的成就，是由于党加强了政治思想工作。
    汉斯·拜姆勒电气机车厂，正在开展一个“洛得维兹运动”。这是一个群众性的提高劳动生产率、修改定额的运动。洛得维兹是一个旋工，他提出的口号是：要做得像一个真正的社会主义工人。他钻研技术，提高劳动生产率，自愿提出修改定额，不拿过多的超额奖励工资。在他的影响之下，工人们都打破了保守思想，交流技术经验，使整个车间生产面貌一新。党组织抓紧了这个典型，在厂内展开了社会主义教育，解释超额完成计划，提高劳动生产率，对于巩固民主德国，壮大社会主义阵营力量的意义，号召为迎接统一社会党第五次全国代表大会，开展“洛得维兹运动”。到5月底，已经有八百五十人改进技术，修改定额。初步计算，八百五十个工人全年可给国家节省二十万马克。到今年年底，要争取有两千人能成为“洛得维兹运动”者。党委书记斯坦因巴锡对记者说：要把思想和政治工作同实际结合起来，才能有效地提高工人的社会主义觉悟。在这个工厂里，党组织经常找工人进行座谈，解释党的各种政策。有时候召开问答会，工人在会上可以提出各种各样的问题，由党组织来解答。许多青年工人生长在社会主义社会里，不懂得什么是资本主义，往往看到民主德国的高级消费品不如西德橱窗里摆得多，就感到不满意。党组织就反复向青工进行教育，揭露西德的真相，说明民主德国工业基础差，是在不利的情况下发展生产的，但是这些困难都能够克服，民主德国已经取得的巨大成就就是证明。在工厂的厂报上，也经常同工人讨论这些问题。思想工作的加强，有力地推动了这个工厂今年的生产。
    在包洛夫县，县委第二书记海勒尔同志热情地向记者介绍了全县农业合作化的发展。这个县参加合作社的土地面积已达到全县耕地面积的49％（全国为34％），到1960年的时候要争取达到90％。半年来，合作化运动所以发展得快，是由于在农村中对党员和农民进行了广泛的社会主义教育。各级党委书记亲自动手，集中力量开展农业合作化运动。县委总结和推广了戈尔卓夫村举办的“昨天、今天、明天”的展览会，用本村过去、现在和将来的对比、发展远景，来说明社会主义制度的优越性，说明农业合作化带来的好处。在党内，普遍进行了辩证唯物主义的教育，各支部都结合县的实际情况，检查了对待社会主义的态度。这样广泛的社会主义教育，有力地促进了全县的农业合作化运动。
    在文化教育界，也出现了新气象。当1953年和1956年，帝国主义发动两次反苏反共的高潮的期间，特别是在匈牙利事件以后，民主德国的文化教育界里，曾经也有过一度的思想混乱。各色各样的修正主义、资产阶级思想都出来了。什么“不要党和政府干预文化事业”，“要求教授独立负责讲课”，散布“自由”“民主”论调，反对学习马克思列宁主义和唯物辩证法等等。1957年1月德国统一社会党三十中全会，强调了加强对文化教育方面的思想工作，提出“思想上不能和平共处”。接着，党批判了一些散布修正主义的报纸杂志，驳斥了一些教授在政治经济学、哲学、历史学、教育学等方面的修正主义谬论，并且在知识分子中，广泛组织了对匈牙利事件的讨论，从中吸取教训。一年多以来，党中央紧紧抓住了政治思想工作这一个环节。先后又召开了文化会议和高等教育会议，讨论了文艺界和教育界的社会主义改造问题。从中央到专区和县，都讨论了发展社会主义文化科学的计划和措施。党抽调优秀干部加强了高等学校的党的领导工作，批判了学校教育中重业务轻政治的思想，明确提出高等学校要培养社会主义知识分子的任务，强调学习马克思列宁主义和唯物辩证法，并使之成为一切教学和研究工作的基础。高等学校的领导，已经开始改变教授个人决定一切的老传统，建立了校务委员会、系务委员会，实行集体领导；并且吸收讲师、助教、学生讨论改进教学工作，学生中的政治空气已经浓厚起来。
    德意志民主共和国由于党加强了政治思想工作，反对了修正主义和资产阶级思想，比较系统地进行了关于两条道路斗争、关于德国统一、关于辩证唯物主义等方面的教育，人民群众的社会主义觉悟有了普遍的提高，从而，也激发和鼓舞了建设社会主义的热情和积极性。行将到来的德国统一社会党第五次代表大会，一定会把全国人民引向社会主义建设的新高潮，引向反对帝国主义斗争的新胜利。（附图片）
