    On the Outpost Battlefield
    Chen Jun

    The German Democratic Republic is the western outpost of the socialist camp. One cannot fully appreciate its significance without visiting the GDR. Is it simply because the GDR borders the imperialist camp? No, if that were the case, several other fraternal countries share a border with the imperialist camp on their western frontiers. However, once you arrive in the GDR, you will feel every day how resolutely and gloriously the GDR is guarding the gate of the socialist camp.

    Here, it was originally one country, but it has been brutally divided by the U.S. imperialism and the Adenauer militarist reactionary clique. In the thirteen years since the war, East and West Germany have established two countries with completely different social systems. The struggle between two systems, two camps, and two classes is bound to be even more acute and intense in a country with an open border. In Berlin, you can see tens of thousands of people coming and going between the two countries every day, from the sky, the ground, and underground. They are compatriots, friends, and relatives, with countless ties. However, they live under two systems. Socialism and capitalism compete here every day, and every policy decision, down to the smallest measure, receives a strong reaction, influencing the direction of people's hearts. Imperialism is taking advantage of every condition, openly and secretly, to attack the socialist system and the GDR. West German newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and television programs spread rumors and slander every day, disseminating bourgeois ideology. Hundreds of spy agencies are engaged in conspiracies. U.S. imperialism, in order to dress up this capitalist showcase, spares no expense in embellishing a false fa√ßade of prosperity. The monopoly capitalists who fled to West Germany are still paying pensions to the former workers of factories in the former territory of East Germany in West Berlin. A so-called "softening policy" is adopted towards intellectuals, enticing them to "escape" to West Germany, and using the American way of life to lure young people with weak wills. Here, religion has also become a vicious tool of imperialism. The imperialists buy off pastors, organize them to visit West Germany, and send money and goods to believers by parcel post. Imperialists are doing everything possible to undermine all the policies of the GDR, hindering farmers from joining cooperatives, recruiting skilled workers at high prices, instigating intellectuals to reject socialist ideological transformation, spreading rumors, inciting backward masses to be dissatisfied with the Party and the government, and alienating the masses from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and the government, attempting to realize the U.S. imperialism and Adenauer's delusional ambition to annex the GDR by force. However, all the imperialists' conspiracies and tricks are in vain. The GDR is growing stronger and stronger in the struggle.

    Everyone knows that the GDR's material foundation is originally in a disadvantageous position compared to West Germany. 80% of Germany's past industry was in West Germany, West Germany is more than twice the size of the GDR, and its population is more than 30 million more. However, in the thirteen years since then, the socialist construction of the GDR has achieved great success. Electricity per capita is already the highest in Europe, the machinery industry is second only to the Soviet Union, brown coal production is the first in the world, and the chemical, optical, and electrical industries all have their own characteristics. In the first quarter of this year, there was a good situation of overfulfilling the plan for the first time in history. At present, the ratio of total industrial output value to total agricultural and forestry output value has reached eighty-six to fourteen. Since October 1957, the agricultural cooperativization movement has developed rapidly. The average yield per unit area of cooperatives has exceeded that of individual farmers, and the yield per unit area of wheat has exceeded that of West Germany, and efforts are being made to surpass West Germany in all agricultural products by 1960. In terms of cultural and educational undertakings, it has long been ahead of West Germany. In 1956, the number of university students per million residents in the GDR was 4,950, while in West Germany it was only 2,550. There are 6,000 university students studying agriculture in East Germany, and only 600 in West Germany, but what these 600 people can do after graduation is still uncertain. Not to mention that West Germany is full of American decadent and corrupt lifestyle and ideology, and rejects German national culture. And what is especially worth reporting to the readers is that since the 30th Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in 1957, remarkable achievements have been made in political and ideological work. Wherever you go, the Party committee secretary of the factory, the county committee secretary, the director of the tractor station, the person in charge of the school party... in their conversations, they will tell you the same conclusion, that the reason why significant achievements have been made in all aspects in the past two years is because the Party has strengthened its political and ideological work.

    The Hans Beimler Electrical Locomotive Factory is carrying out a "Lodewig Movement." This is a mass movement to improve labor productivity and revise quotas. Lodewig is a turner, and his slogan is: to act like a true socialist worker. He studies technology, improves labor productivity, and voluntarily proposes to revise quotas, without taking excessive bonus wages. Under his influence, workers have broken conservative thinking and exchanged technical experience, making the entire workshop's production look new. The Party organization seized this typical example, launched socialist education in the factory, explained the significance of overfulfilling the plan and improving labor productivity for consolidating the GDR and strengthening the socialist camp, and called for the "Lodewig Movement" to be launched in order to welcome the Fifth National Congress of the Socialist Unity Party. By the end of May, 850 people had improved their technology and revised their quotas. Preliminary calculations show that 850 workers can save the state 200,000 marks per year. By the end of this year, they will strive to have 2,000 people become "Lodewig Movement" participants. Party Committee Secretary Steinbach told reporters: "To effectively improve workers' socialist consciousness, we must combine ideological and political work with practice." In this factory, the Party organization often holds discussions with workers to explain the Party's various policies. Sometimes, question-and-answer sessions are held where workers can raise various questions, which are answered by the Party organization. Many young workers grew up in socialist society and do not understand what capitalism is. They often feel dissatisfied when they see that the GDR's high-end consumer goods are not as numerous as those displayed in West German shop windows. The Party organization repeatedly educates young workers, exposing the truth about West Germany, explaining that the GDR's industrial base is poor and that production is developing under unfavorable conditions, but that these difficulties can be overcome, and the great achievements already made by the GDR are proof of this. These issues are also frequently discussed with workers in the factory's newspaper. The strengthening of ideological work has powerfully promoted the factory's production this year.

    In Ballow County, Comrade Heller, the Second Secretary of the County Committee, enthusiastically introduced the development of agricultural cooperativization in the county to reporters. The land area participating in cooperatives in this county has reached 49% of the county's arable land (34% nationwide), and they will strive to reach 90% by 1960. The reason why the cooperativization movement has developed rapidly in the past six months is due to the extensive socialist education conducted among Party members and farmers in rural areas. Party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead and concentrated their efforts on carrying out the agricultural cooperativization movement. The County Committee summarized and promoted the "Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow" exhibition held in the village of Golzow, using the comparison of the village's past, present, and future, and the prospects for development, to illustrate the superiority of the socialist system and the benefits brought by agricultural cooperativization. Within the Party, a universal education in dialectical materialism was carried out, and all branches reviewed their attitude towards socialism in light of the county's actual situation. This extensive socialist education powerfully promoted the agricultural cooperativization movement throughout the county.

    New atmospheres have also emerged in the cultural and educational spheres. During the two anti-Soviet and anti-communist upsurges launched by imperialism in 1953 and 1956, especially after the Hungarian Incident, there was also a period of ideological confusion in the cultural and educational spheres of the GDR. All kinds of revisionist and bourgeois ideas emerged. Some advocated "no interference by the Party and the government in cultural undertakings," "requiring professors to lecture independently and responsibly," spreading the rhetoric of "freedom" and "democracy," opposing the study of Marxism-Leninism and dialectical materialism, and so on. The 30th Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in January 1957 emphasized strengthening ideological work in the cultural and educational fields, and proposed "no peaceful coexistence in ideology." Subsequently, the Party criticized some newspapers and magazines that spread revisionism, refuted some professors' revisionist fallacies in political economics, philosophy, history, education, and other fields, and extensively organized discussions on the Hungarian Incident among intellectuals to draw lessons from it. For more than a year, the Party Central Committee has firmly grasped the key link of political and ideological work. It has successively convened cultural conferences and higher education conferences to discuss the socialist transformation of the literary and art circles and the educational circles. From the central government to the districts and counties, plans and measures for developing socialist culture and science have been discussed. The Party transferred outstanding cadres to strengthen the Party's leadership in institutions of higher learning, criticized the idea of stressing professional work while neglecting politics in school education, clearly put forward the task of institutions of higher learning to cultivate socialist intellectuals, emphasized the study of Marxism-Leninism and dialectical materialism, and made it the basis of all teaching and research work. The leadership of institutions of higher learning has begun to change the old tradition of professors deciding everything, established school affairs committees and department affairs committees, implemented collective leadership, and absorbed lecturers, teaching assistants, and students to discuss and improve teaching work, and the political atmosphere among students has become stronger.

    Because the German Democratic Republic has strengthened its political and ideological work, opposed revisionism and bourgeois ideology, and conducted relatively systematic education on the struggle between two roads, on German reunification, and on dialectical materialism, the socialist consciousness of the people has been universally enhanced, thereby also stimulating and encouraging the enthusiasm and initiative for building socialism. The upcoming Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany will surely lead the people of the whole country to a new upsurge in socialist construction and to a new victory in the struggle against imperialism.
