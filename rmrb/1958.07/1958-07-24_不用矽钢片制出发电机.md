Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 22nd: The Xining Electric Motor Hardware Manufacturing Factory, relying on its own efforts and resources, has successfully trial-produced a 15-kilowatt generator and a 5-horsepower electric motor without silicon steel sheets and with limited technical expertise. Mass production has now begun.

This factory was formed by several handicraft cooperatives and some personnel transferred from government offices. Equipped with old and outdated machines, the workers dared to think and act, jointly researching the use of black iron sheets as a substitute for silicon steel sheets. Lacking cloth-covered copper wire, they melted scrap copper themselves to draw copper wire and built their own cloth-covering machine to make cloth-covered copper wire. They also adopted methods such as researching, trial-producing, and improving simultaneously, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient technical expertise, and successfully generated electricity with the 15-kilowatt generator they produced.

In order to prepare raw materials for mass production of generators and electric motors, this factory is actively using indigenous methods to trial-produce silicon steel sheets and electrolytic copper (for drawing copper wire), and is also planning to smelt its own steel.

    不用矽钢片制出发电机
    据新华社西宁22日电　西宁电机五金制造厂自力更生，在没有矽钢片和技术力量薄弱的情况下，试制成功十五瓩的发电机和五马力的电动机，现在已开始大批生产。
    这个厂是由几个手工业合作社和一些机关下放人员等组成的，设备都是老式旧机器。职工们敢想敢做，共同研究用黑铁皮代替矽钢片，没有纱包铜线，自己用废铜熔炼后拔成铜丝，并自造了一台纱包机，做成纱包铜线。他们又采取边研究、边试制、边改进等办法，克服了技术力量不足的困难，制出的十五瓩发电机发出了电来。
    这个厂为了给大批生产发电机和电动机准备原材料，正在积极用土法试制矽钢片、电解铜（拔铜丝用），还要自己炼钢。
