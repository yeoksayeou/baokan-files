Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 14th: The people of Fujian won time and, in the ten-plus days before the busy summer harvest, accumulated over 16 billion dan of native and miscellaneous fertilizers needed for autumn crops. The provincial average is over 1,000 dan per mu (each dan being 100 jin), laying a reliable foundation for a greater autumn harvest.

This crash manure accumulation campaign basically ended on July 11th. The amount of manure accumulated in fourteen days is almost three times the total amount accumulated in the province in the past eight years. In order to race against time and strive for first place, five to six million people across the province braved the sweltering heat every day and night, "searching outside, scooping in the streams, digging in the mountains, dredging in the sea, and rushing to build factories to make fertilizer." Manure accumulation expeditions sent to the mountains adopted the method of "building fertilizer depots at the edge of the fields and erecting fertilizer sheds all over the mountains," accumulating fertilizer locally and applying it locally. Local garrisons, government cadres, urban residents, all teachers and students except for graduating classes, and some workers used their evenings and early mornings to accumulate more than 100 dan of fertilizer per person and send it to local cooperatives. Jinjiang, Nanjing, and other counties accumulated enough fertilizer in ten days and nights of hard work to apply 3,000 dan per mu. At present, large numbers of people are rushing to transport fertilizer. Some mountainous cooperatives have erected aerial cableways and bamboo and wood slides for aerial transportation, greatly improving work efficiency. Ninghua County used bamboo tubes to lay underground fertilizer pipelines, connecting the mountains with fertilizer depots at the edge of the fields, which is more than 100 times more efficient than manual carrying.

This crash manure accumulation in Fujian Province has provided good experience for continuously increasing fertilizer accumulation in the future. That is: give prominence to politics, and resolutely implement the mass line as a working method. This time, all localities have raised the specific work of manure accumulation to the significance of the general line for publicity, explaining that fertilizer is the "grain" of grain, and that without grasping fertilizer, it is impossible to grasp grain, so that the broad masses of cadres and the masses further understand that accumulating more fertilizer and producing more grain means implementing the general line on the production front.

    福建省十四天积肥量等于八年总和的三倍
    据新华社福州14日电　福建人民赢得时间，在夏收大忙以前的十多天里积好了秋收作物需用的土杂肥料一百六十多亿担，全省平均每亩可施肥一千多担（每担一百斤），为秋季更大丰收打下可靠基础。
    这次突击积肥运动到7月11日已基本结束。十四天的积肥量，差不多等于全省过去八年来积肥总和的三倍。为了和时间赛跑，力争第一，全省每天都有五、六百万人冒着酷暑，日夜在“屋外找，溪里掏，山上挖，海里捞，赶办工厂制肥料”。派往山上的积肥远征队，采取“田头造肥库，满山搭肥棚”的办法，就地积肥，就地施用。各地驻军、机关干部、城镇居民和除了毕业班以外的全体师生，以及部分工人，都利用晚上和清晨的时间，每人积了一百多担肥料送给当地合作社。晋江、南靖等县苦战十昼夜的积肥量，达到每亩可施三千担。目前各地正在千军万马突击运肥，一些山区合作社架起空中索道和竹木滑道，进行空中运输，大大提高了工作效率。宁化县利用竹筒铺设地下输肥管，和山上以及地头的肥库相通，比人工挑运效率提高一百多倍。
    福建省这次突击积肥，为今后经常性源源增积肥料提供了良好的经验。这就是：政治挂帅，坚决贯彻群众路线的工作方法。这次，各地都把积肥的具体工作提高到总路线的意义上来宣传，说明肥料是粮食的“粮食”，抓不到肥料，就抓不到粮食，使广大干部和群众进一步明确多积肥多打粮，就是在生产战线上贯彻了总路线。
