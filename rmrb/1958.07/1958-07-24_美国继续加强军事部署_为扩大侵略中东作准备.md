    Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd Dispatch from Washington: The United States is continuing to strengthen its military deployments and is actively preparing to expand its military aggression in the Middle East.

    The U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee decided on the 22nd to maintain the U.S. armed forces at a high level of manpower, and decided to allocate huge sums of money to maintain a large force. According to this decision, the U.S. Army will maintain 900,000 men, the Marine Corps 200,000 men, the National Guard 500,000 men, and the reserve force 300,000 men. These figures are higher than those proposed by President Eisenhower and Defense Secretary McElroy in this year's budget plan.

    The committee also approved the appropriation of $2.1 million to build a new air force base in Andravida, Greece.

    On the same day, the U.S. Navy Department announced that in order to meet the frequent needs of dispatching intervention troops and transporting supplies to them, the Navy's transport fleet has added 30 new ships, including 14 freighters, 15 oil tankers, and one troop carrier.

    According to reports from Beirut, another U.S. aircraft carrier has arrived and is anchored outside the port of Beirut. The aircraft carrier "Corregidor," which sailed from Naples, Italy, has transported more helicopters and light liaison planes for the U.S. intervention troops.

    美国继续加强军事部署
    为扩大侵略中东作准备
    据新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国正在继续加强军事部署，积极准备扩大在中东的军事侵略。
    美国参议院拨款小组委员会22日决议把美国武装部队的兵员人数保持在高额水平上，并且决定拨付巨额款项来维持庞大的兵力。根据这个决定，美国陆军将保持九十万人、海军陆战队二十万人、国民警卫队五十万人、后备兵员三十万人。这些数字都比总统艾森豪威尔和国防部长麦克耳罗伊在今年预算计划中所提出的数字要高。
    这个委员会还批准拨款二百一十万美元在希腊的安德拉维达建造一处新空军基地。
    同一天美国海军部宣布说，为了满足调遣干涉军和替他们运送给养的频繁需要，海军的运输船队新增加了三十艘船，其中包括十四艘货船，十五艘运油船和一艘运兵船。
    据来自贝鲁特的消息说，又有一艘美国航空母舰开到贝鲁特港外停泊。这艘由意大利那不勒斯港开去的“科里吉多”号航空母舰替美国干涉军运去了更多直升飞机和轻型联络机。
