Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 29th: TASS reports: Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent separate letters to U.S. President Eisenhower, British Prime Minister Macmillan, and French Premier de Gaulle on July 28th. In the letters, he stated that, in view of the extremely tense situation created in the Middle East, the Soviet government still believes it is imperative to immediately convene a meeting attended by the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India, with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General.

In the letters, Khrushchev pointed out that Eisenhower's reply on July 25th indicated that the U.S. government had departed from its position of July 22nd regarding the swift convening of a special session of the Security Council attended by heads of government to study the situation in the Middle East, and instead advocated resubmitting the issue to the regular sessions of the UN Security Council for discussion. Macmillan's reply on the 26th showed that the British Prime Minister also supported this suggestion.

Khrushchev stated in the letters that it was evident that this approach was aimed at burying the already reached agreement on swiftly convening a five-power summit. We cannot accept this.

In his letters to the heads of government of the United States and Britain, Khrushchev pointed out that the course taken by the U.S. and British governments, which essentially rejected the summit meeting, could not but cause unease among the peoples of all countries.

Public opinion in various countries is raising, with unease, the question of whether the governments of the countries responsible for the current tense situation in the Middle East are trying to lull the vigilance of the people in order to secretly plot new acts of aggression. It should be known that U.S. troops continue to land in Lebanon, where, under the support and cover of U.S. bayonets, State Department envoy Murphy is carrying out suspicious activities, interfering rudely in Lebanon's internal affairs. The U.S. Navy is gathering in the Eastern Mediterranean, and U.S. reinforcements are being airlifted from Europe to the Middle East, especially to the Adana region of Turkey. Particularly noteworthy in this regard is the fact that Turkey itself is also making extensive preparations for armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab Eastern countries. King Hussein of Jordan, who has lost the support of his own people and relies on the backing of interventionists, dares to make threats of force, threatening to march on Baghdad. Now, there is a clear trend towards expanding the zone of aggression. The threat of military attack looms over the Republic of Iraq.

Khrushchev said that now more than ever, it is necessary to take swift and vigorous action to ensure the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan and to prevent the expansion of armed conflict in the Middle East. Time is of the essence.

However, it cannot be pointed out that the U.S. government not only has not promoted the swift convening of a summit meeting in order to immediately stop the armed conflict in the Middle East, but instead sent its Secretary of State to London to attend a meeting of members of the Baghdad Pact. Someone is hurrying to patch up this treaty, and the fact that Iraq, the only Arab country in the treaty, has withdrawn from it once again demonstrates the failure of the "position of strength" policy and the policy of piecing together aggressive blocs pursued by Western countries. At the same time, the U.S. government is trying by every means to obstruct the resolution of the major issue that all mankind expects to be resolved – stopping the armed intervention by the United States and Britain in the Middle East. The U.S. government is trying to trap the negotiations on the summit meeting in the labyrinth of endless discussions about the form and procedures of the meeting.

The London meeting of representatives of the governments of Britain, the United States, Turkey, Pakistan, and Iran is being held in circumstances in which foreign troops have not only not withdrawn from Lebanon and Jordan, but are also preparing at full speed for armed intervention in the affairs of the Republic of Iraq. Therefore, this meeting is a conspiracy against the Arab countries. Isn't the purpose of all this to plot new acts of aggression and to confront the world with an increasingly expanding military conflict by pursuing a policy of fait accompli?

Therefore, the path taken by Eisenhower is not the path to resolving the military conflict that has already begun in the Middle East, in order to maintain and consolidate peace, but instead is leading things towards expanding the area of military conflict and threatening mankind with a world catastrophe. Therefore, Eisenhower bears a serious responsibility to mankind and to history for the consequences of this policy of the U.S. government. British Prime Minister Macmillan also bears a serious responsibility, because despite his attempts to be flexible, he is essentially pursuing the same policy aimed at obstructing any measures to eliminate the military conflict in Lebanon and Jordan.

In view of the current extremely tense situation in the Middle East, the Soviet government still believes it is imperative to immediately convene a five-power summit of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India, with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet government was satisfied with the opinion expressed by de Gaulle in his reply on July 26th, in which he stated his support for the proposal to immediately convene a five-power summit with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General. The Soviet government also supports de Gaulle's proposal to hold this meeting in Europe. The Soviet government, as before, does not object to holding this meeting in New York, Geneva, Vienna, Paris, or any other location acceptable to the participants in the meeting. The Soviet government would also welcome holding the meeting in Moscow.

In his letters to the heads of government of the United States and Britain, Khrushchev also pointed out that they had avoided mentioning the participation of the Indian Prime Minister in the summit meeting in their previous letters. Khrushchev believed it necessary to emphasize once again that India's participation in the aforementioned meeting is of great significance for reaching constructive decisions to resolve the situation in the Middle East.

Regarding the date of the meeting, Khrushchev said that since the U.S. President considered the July 28th date suggested by the Soviet government to be too hasty, and the British Prime Minister was also not satisfied with this date, and the French Premier did not mention any date in his reply, the Soviet Union is prepared to hold the meeting on another, later date. Khrushchev hoped to receive a clear answer: When exactly are the governments of the United States, Britain, and France willing to attend the five-power summit?

### 鉴于目前中近东地区局势极其紧张  苏联要求立即召开五国首脑会议  赫鲁晓夫再次分别写信给美英法三国政府首脑

    鉴于目前中近东地区局势极其紧张
    苏联要求立即召开五国首脑会议
    赫鲁晓夫再次分别写信给美英法三国政府首脑
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在28日分别写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔、英国首相麦克米伦和法国总理戴高乐。他在信中说，鉴于目前在中近东造成的极其紧张的局势，苏联政府仍然认为，必须立即召开苏联、美国、英国、法国、印度政府首脑和有联合国秘书长参加的会议。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中指出，艾森豪威尔在7月25日的复信表明，美国政府离开了7月22日所采取的关于迅速召开由政府首脑参加的安全理事会特别会议来研究中近东地区局势的立场，而主张重新把这个问题提交联合国安全理事会常会讨论。麦克米伦26日的复信表明，英国首相也支持这个建议。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中说，可见这种方针就是要埋葬已经取得的关于迅速召开五国政府首脑会议的协议。我们不能接受这一点。
    赫鲁晓夫在给美英两国政府首脑的信中指出，美英两国政府所采取的实质上是拒绝政府首脑会议的方针，不能不引起各国人民的不安。
    各国的舆论界人士怀着不安的心情提出一个问题：应对中近东目前紧张局势负责的国家的政府是不是想麻痹人民的警惕性，偷偷地策划新的侵略行动。要知道，美国军队继续在黎巴嫩登陆，在那里，在美国刺刀的支持和掩护下，国务院特使墨菲展开了行迹可疑的活动，他横暴无礼地干涉黎巴嫩内政。美国海军正在地中海东部集结，美国增援部队正在从欧洲空运到中近东，特别是土耳其的亚达那地区。在这方面特别值得注意的还有：在土耳其本国最近也广泛地准备武装干涉阿拉伯东方各国的内政。失去了本国人民支持的、依靠干涉者撑腰的约旦国王侯赛因竟敢用武力进行威胁，扬言要向巴格达进军。现在可以看到有扩大侵略区的明显趋势。军事进攻的威胁笼罩着伊拉克共和国。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在比过去任何时候都更加需要采取迅速有力的行动，以保证使外国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，并且使在中近东的武装冲突地区不致扩大。时间是不等人的。
    但是，不能不指出，美国政府不仅没有促进政府首脑会议迅速召开，以便立即停止中近东地区的武装冲突，反而派自己的国务卿去伦敦参加巴格达条约成员国的会议。有人正在急忙企图为这个条约打补钉，而这个条约的唯一的一个阿拉伯国家——伊拉克退出这个条约的事实，再一次表明了西方国家所执行的“实力地位”政策和拼凑侵略集团政策已经失败。同时美国政府企图百般阻挠解决全人类所期待解决的当前主要问题——停止美国和英国在中近东的武装干涉问题。美国政府企图使关于政府首脑会议的谈判陷入无止境的讨论这个会议的形式和程序的迷宫中。
    英国、美国、土耳其、巴基斯坦和伊朗政府代表伦敦会议是在这样的情况下举行的：这时外国军队不仅没有从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出，而且正在开足马力地准备着武装干涉伊拉克共和国的事务，因此这个会议是反对阿拉伯国家的阴谋。这一切的做法，其目的难道不是在阴谋策划新的侵略行动，用执行既成事实的政策的办法使世界面临日益扩大的军事冲突吗？
    因此，艾森豪威尔所走的道路不是解决中近东已经开始的军事冲突，以维护和巩固和平的道路，而是把事情引向扩大军事冲突地区，使人类面临世界灾难的威胁，因此，对于美国政府这种政策的后果，艾森豪威尔首先对人类和历史负有严重的责任。英国首相麦克米伦也负有严重责任。因为他尽管试图随机应变，但实质上也是执行旨在阻挠采取任何措施来消除黎巴嫩和约旦军事冲突的同样的政策。
    苏联政府鉴于中近东地区当前极端紧张的局势，仍旧认为必须立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、美、英、法、印五国政府首脑会议。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府对戴高乐7月26日在复信中表示的意见感到满意，戴高乐表示他支持关于立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的五国政府首脑会议的建议。苏联政府还支持戴高乐主张在欧洲举行这个会晤的建议。苏联政府像从前一样也不反对在纽约、在日内瓦、维也纳、巴黎和在会议参加者可以接受的任何其他地点举行这个会议，苏联政府也将欢迎在莫斯科举行会晤。
    赫鲁晓夫在给美、英两国政府首脑的信中还指出，他们两人在上一封信中避而不谈印度总理参加政府首脑会议的问题。赫鲁晓夫认为有必要再一次着重指出，印度参加上述会议对于达成解决中近东局势问题的建设性决议具有重大的意义。
    关于举行会议的日期，赫鲁晓夫说，既然美国总统认为苏联政府所建议的7月28日过于急迫，英国首相也不满意这个日期，法国总理在回信中没有谈到任何日期，那么，苏联准备在另外一个最近的日子举行会议。赫鲁晓夫希望得到一个明确的答复：美国、英国和法国政府究竟愿意在什么时候参加五国政府首脑会议。
