    A Gift for "July 1st" Chen Qiyuan
        (I)
    The red flag is held high, sending out the east wind, (Note)
    The masses cheer and follow the scene;
    Politics are now fully in command,
    Sweeping away the "three winds and five airs"!
      (Note) On June 22nd, the second group of 280 comrades from the Fourth Detachment went to the Ming Tombs Reservoir for voluntary labor. At 3 pm that day, they marched east from the dormitory and began to work. Premier Zhou held the red flag high, leading the team forward, his gestures firm, standard, and unwavering.
        (II)
    Eating, living, and laboring together,
    Daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act;
    A new style of communism,
    Three days' task completed in two days! (Note)
     (Note) On this day, the masses were full of energy and completed 124.1 cubic meters of rock excavation on the first day, equivalent to 48% of the 260 cubic meters assigned for three days. This shows that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the combination of putting politics in command and the power of the masses is a guarantee for building socialism successfully, quickly, well, and economically.

    “七一”献礼	陈其瑗
        （一）
    红旗高举发东风，（注）
    群众欢呼尽景从；
    政治于今全挂帅，
    三风五气扫而空！
      （注）6月22日，四支队第二批到十三陵水库义务劳动同志共二百八十人。当天下午三时由宿舍往东行军，开始劳动，周总理高举红旗，领导队伍前进，手势坚定合乎规格毫不动摇。
        （二）
    同吃同住同劳动，
    敢想敢言敢实行；
    共产主义新风格，
    三天任务两天成！（注）
     （注）是日群众干劲十足，第一天就完成石方124.1立公方，相当于交下三天任务260立公方的48％。由此可见在党中央毛主席领导下政治挂帅与群众力量相结合，是多快好省地建设社会主义成功的保证。
