Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 19th: The Kishi Nobusuke government has instructed its representative to the United Nations to prepare a proposal to the Security Council to "strengthen the United Nations observation group" in Lebanon. This proposal by the Kishi Nobusuke government seeks to resurrect the American proposal that was already rejected by the Security Council. The purpose of the American proposal was to "legalize" its aggression against Lebanon under the banner of a "United Nations police force."

The Kishi Nobusuke government's proposal not only fails to condemn the American act of aggression but instead affirms the excuse used by the United States for sending troops to Lebanon. According to Western news agencies, the Kishi Nobusuke government states in its proposal that, given that the U.S. government has indicated it sent troops to Lebanon "at the request of the Lebanese government," it is appropriate for the UN observation group to continue its current activities. The Japanese proposal advocates strengthening this observation group in order to create a situation that would enable the "rapid withdrawal" of American troops. United Press International says that the United States considers the Japanese proposal "not bad."

    日本在安理会准备提一个提案
    企图使美国提案借尸还魂
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府已经训令它的驻联合国的代表准备向安全理事会提出在黎巴嫩“加强联合国观察团”的提案。岸信介政府的这个提案是想使已经被安全理事会否决的美国提案借尸还魂。美国提案的目的是想用“联合国警察部队”的旗帜使它侵略黎巴嫩的行为“合法化”。
    岸信介政府的提案不仅没有谴责美国的侵略行为，反而肯定美国出兵黎巴嫩的借口。据西方通讯社报道，岸信介政府在它的提案中说：鉴于美国政府表示它是“应黎巴嫩政府的要求”而派遣军队到黎巴嫩去的，联合国观察团继续目前的活动是适当的；日本的提案主张加强这个观察团，以便造成使美国部队能够“迅速地撤退”的局势。合众国际社说，美国认为日本的提案“不坏”。
