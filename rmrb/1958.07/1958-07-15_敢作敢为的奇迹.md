Daring Miracles
By our correspondent Hu Mingjun

Contradiction

A Party branch secretary who doesn't understand technology but has a communist spirit, along with several Party members, led a workshop to create a miracle of doubling production in twenty-one days, transforming the workshop's production level from the most backward to the most advanced in the country.

This rare production miracle occurred in the Second Refractory Materials Workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. From mid-April to early May, within twenty-one days, the kiln firing time per furnace of bricks in this workshop plummeted from the original ninety-plus hours to sixteen and a half hours. The monthly production level soared from four or five hundred tons to more than one thousand four hundred tons. Both kiln firing time and coal consumption jumped to the most advanced levels in the country.

For a long time, the production technology of this workshop had been conservative and backward, with kiln firing time per furnace of bricks being twice as long as that of Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant. The refractory materials produced by the workshop often could not meet the needs of the plant's steelmaking workshop. In March of this year, after the Second Steelmaking Workshop drastically increased its production level by more than two times, the contradiction of refractory materials not meeting the needs of steelmaking became even more prominent. All the workers of the plant pinned their hopes for a great leap forward in steel production this year on increasing the output of the refractory materials workshop.

The plant Party committee required the refractory materials workshop to rapidly increase production by one or two times without increasing equipment. Many workers in the workshop expressed doubt, anxiety, and a lack of confidence.

Chen Shuchun, the Party branch secretary, and several branch committee members conducted a calm and specific analysis in the face of the heavy production burden and the workers' ideological state. They believed that the workshop's production could be increased by two times, the key was whether the leaders and the masses could recognize the significance of the leap forward and whether they could liberate their thinking. Branch Secretary Chen Shuchun said: Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant has promoted "fast kiln firing," reducing the firing time to thirty-two hours. If we also promote it and reduce our firing time from the current ninety-plus hours to thirty-two hours, we can increase production by more than one time. We sent people to learn "fast kiln firing," but why haven't we promoted it yet, and why are we clinging to backward technical regulations? The main reason is that our leaders and technical cadres haven't liberated their thinking...

Through debates, the branch committee members liberated their thinking. After the Party members and workers in the workshop launched ideological debates, they also dispelled their doubts.

While the Party branch was formulating plans and organizing debates, some administrative and technical cadres in the workshop were also busy studying leap forward plans. They planned to build three more large kilns, purchase large pulverizers, automated blast ball mills, crushers, brick presses, oil presses... After "careful calculations," the investment would be at least one million yuan. While they were busy drafting plans, they also wrote letters to Beijing and Anshan requesting blueprints and data.

After the Party branch's leap forward plan was announced, Engineer Chen and Engineer Xu, who was in charge of refractory materials in the central laboratory, shook their heads and said, "This is simply a joke!" Engineer Xu said, "Without increasing any equipment, just relying on the masses to find some tricks can at most improve production a little bit, but it can never be increased by one or two times!"

Adhering to Principles and Supporting Innovation

Chen Shuchun and the branch committee members discussed and decided not to increase any equipment, but to rely closely on the veteran workers, break with conventions, and promote "fast kiln firing."

Kiln foreman Xing Yanqing found many experienced master workers to carefully study "fast kiln firing" and formulated a complete set of new operating methods. When Xing Yanqing happily took the new operating methods to Engineer Chen in the workshop for approval, Engineer Chen ambiguously said, "We need to consider it... it's best to take it to Engineer Xu for deliberation."

In Engineer Xu's office, after much persuasion, Engineer Xu finally instructed: "Conduct temporary tests in small kilns."

The branch committee made detailed studies and arrangements for the implementation of the new operating technology. Branch Secretary Chen Shuchun and two branch committee members all went to the large kilns where the new operating methods were being promoted to plant experimental fields; they selected Communist Party member Wang Zhiyin, an experienced veteran worker with nearly twenty years of kiln firing experience, to fire the first shot in the promotion. Chen Shuchun said to Wang Zhiyin: The first shot is very important, it must be a success. Wang Zhiyin sensed that she was still a little worried, and said: Secretary, as long as you support me, I'm at least 80% sure about promoting "fast kiln firing" technology.

The new operating method for kiln firing was officially put into trial implementation. On the first day of the promotion, Wang Zhiyin worked the first shift on one kiln and immediately ran to another kiln to work the first shift, working for sixteen hours straight. He and the kiln workers boldly and completely negated the kiln temperature heating curve originally stipulated by the engineering and technical personnel that "the temperature can only rise by five to fifteen degrees per hour below two hundred degrees." In the first eight hours of the first shift, they rapidly raised the kiln temperature to four hundred and forty degrees, and the kiln was still very normal. According to the old regulations, it would take five shifts and forty hours to raise the kiln temperature to over four hundred degrees. In this way, the kiln firing time was greatly shortened.

The branch committee members stayed at the kiln day and night, helping the masses solve problems, and working with the trade union cadres to summarize experience and organize competitions. As soon as Wang Zhiyin's "three diligence" and "three quick" kiln firing experience was created, the branch committee members and trade union cadres summarized it overnight and promoted it in each kiln the next day. Among Party members and the masses, a heated competition was launched, which not only quickly overturned the original 90% of kiln firing technical regulations, but also greatly revised and enriched the new operating methods.

Letting Go and Working Hard, Repelling Obstruction

On the very day that Wang Zhiyin worked sixteen hours straight, the technical supervision personnel filled out eight records of his violation of operating procedures; the head of the supervision station ran over and angrily questioned him: "Do you know that the operating procedures are 'plant rules and laws'? If you mess around like this, you'll be in trouble!" The usually silent Wang Zhiyin continued to work without saying a word, thinking: You can't scare me, I'm doing things according to the Party branch's correct decision.

The technical supervision personnel took the workers' records of violations of operating procedures to kiln foreman Xing Yanqing for signature. Xing Yanqing refused to sign according to the regulations, which angered the head of the supervision station. He pointed his finger at the foreman and said: "Old Xing, do you still need operating procedures? You are messing around, who will be responsible if something goes wrong!" Foreman Xing also got angry and retorted sternly: "You people doing technical supervision have higher technology than us, but instead of coming to support us, you are obstructing us! If something goes wrong, we will bear it ourselves, when have we ever implicated you!?"

Some engineering and technical personnel felt uneasy in the face of the masses' creation and innovation. Engineer Xu came down, turned around by the kiln a few times, and said in surprise and anxiety: The temperature is rising too fast, too fast will cause problems, and then he left. A section chief from the technical supervision section came down to record the temperature rise. At first, he recorded it seriously, but later, when he saw the fire in the kiln burning so fiercely and the kiln temperature rising like an arrow, he threw away his pen in fright and ran away.

Once, when the tool bricks in the kiln collapsed during kiln firing, the head of the supervision station immediately stood up confidently and said: "This is still a small accident, if you mess around again, you'll have big accidents, and you'll be in big trouble!"

Another time, a few refractory bricks in the kiln had a slight problem of insufficient temperature. The engineers picked them out and said in front of Secretary Chen Shuchun and the workers: "See, this is the result of fast kiln firing."

The panic and intimidation of the engineering and technical personnel, the massive filling of workers' violations of operating procedures by the technical supervision personnel, and especially the occurrence of two small accidents on the kiln, caused some workers to feel worried. Because they violated the original "plant rules and laws," no matter how good the production was in the competition, they couldn't be rated as advanced, and if something went wrong, they would be subject to administrative punishment. Some worried masses went to Chen Shuchun and suggested: Secretary, our new operating methods are still "illegitimate children," why doesn't the administration approve them sooner?

Once, Engineer Xu came down, and the workers surrounded him and asked him why he didn't approve the new operating methods.

"I'm not sure! We should do more tests, more tests," Engineer Xu said with seeming difficulty.

"No, it must be approved quickly," the workers said a little angrily.

Engineer Xu had no choice but to promise to go back and hold a technical research meeting immediately.

At the technical research meeting, two engineers found a large pile of refractory material books in the library to study, and believed that the operating methods used by the workers could not find any "theoretical basis," and the conclusion was that they could not be approved.

No matter how great the difficulties and obstructions, the workshop Party branch always relied on the masses and insisted on promoting the new kiln firing technology. With the support of the Party committee secretary, the branch publicly announced: During the trial implementation of the new operating methods, violations of the old operating procedures will not be used as conditions for competition evaluation; the branch will bear the responsibility for any problems; and called on everyone to rise up to attack conservatism, repel obstruction, and let go and work hard. In this way, the masses boldly innovated technology, and the workers in each work section and each production link rose up to comprehensively implement technical innovations, realizing nine major technical reforms and breaking through more than six hundred and seventy conventions.

A Storm

When the new bricks from the three kilns of "fast kiln firing" came out and were inspected and identified, a storm was caused. After inspection and identification, the supervisory inspection personnel declared that the refractory bricks born under the new operating methods were "not up to standard" and that most of them should be scrapped.

This declaration spread throughout the workshop and even the entire plant. Some engineers who did not agree with the new operating methods from the beginning were now really eloquent. Some said, I said it wouldn't work, now, it really doesn't! Some said: The promotion of "fast kiln firing" should be cautious, the branch was too hasty this time.

Some of the masses in the workshop were very anxious and sad when they heard that the entire kiln was being scrapped.

Was it really the case that most of these few kilns of bricks should be scrapped?

At an on-site meeting of the refractory material workshop attended by the Party committee secretary, the plant director, and engineers from the plant department, Branch Secretary Chen Shuchun rose up to expose the secret of the so-called scrapping of most of the bricks. She said: The workshop branch organized many experienced veteran workers to analyze and study several kilns of bricks and believed that there were some minor problems in loading the kiln and controlling the kiln temperature, but it was definitely not due to the promotion of "fast kiln firing." More than 80% or 60% of these kilns of bricks are qualified, but the inspection personnel, who are always suspicious of our quality problems, do not use normal inspection methods, but specially pick a few unrepresentative and fragile bricks to inspect when taking samples, and use this as a basis for judging them to be scrapped.

At the on-site meeting, after research and judgment by the Party and government leaders of the plant and the engineers of the plant department, it was believed that the three kilns of bricks were qualified products, and the Party committee secretary strictly criticized the inspection personnel for unilaterally judging and wasting state property casually.

The battle to boldly break with conventions and innovate technology brought huge production results to the workshop: the kiln firing time per furnace of bricks was reduced from more than ninety hours to sixteen and a half hours, the kiln firing cycle was increased from three kilns of one hundred and sixty hours per month to ten kilns of sixty hours per month, and the coal consumption was reduced from four hundred and fifty kilograms per ton of bricks to one hundred and ninety-two kilograms. The comprehensive quality of the products increased from 91.63% to 94.87%. In this way, this workshop not only did not need an investment of one million yuan, but instead created an additional wealth of one million seven hundred thousand yuan for the country.

    敢作敢为的奇迹
    本报记者　胡明俊
    矛盾
    一个不懂技术、却有共产主义风格的党支部书记和几个党员，领导一个车间在二十一天里创造了提高产量两倍、使车间生产水平由全国最落后变为最先进的奇迹。
    这个罕见的生产奇迹，发生在重庆钢铁公司第二耐火材料车间。从4月中旬到5月初的二十一天内，这个车间每炉砖的烧窑时间由原来九十多小时陡降到十六小时半，月产水平由四、五百吨猛增到一千四百多吨，烧窑时间和煤耗都一跃为全国最先进的水平。
    这个车间的生产技术长期来是保守落后的，每炉砖的烧窑时间要比唐山钢铁厂高出两倍。车间生产的耐火材料，常常满足不了本厂炼钢车间需要。今年3月，公司第二炼钢车间将生产水平猛然提高两倍多后，耐火材料供不上炼钢需要的矛盾就更突出了。全厂职工都把今年钢产量能否大跃进的期望寄托在提高耐火材料车间的产量上。
    厂党委要求耐火材料车间在不增加设备下，迅速将产量跃进一、两倍，车间许多职工表示怀疑、焦虑，缺乏信心。
    车间党支部书记陈淑春和几个支委，在沉重的生产担子和群众的思想情绪面前，做了冷静的、具体的分析。他们认为车间生产不是不能提高两倍，关键在于领导和群众是否能认识跃进的意义，能否解放思想。支部书记陈淑春说：唐山钢铁厂推广了“快速烧窑”，烧窑时间已降到三十二小时，我们也推广把烧窑时间由现在九十多小时降到三十二小时，就能使产量跃进一倍多。我们派人学了“快速烧窑”，可是为什么现在还没推广，死抱着落后技术规程不放呢？主要是我们的领导干部、技术干部思想没有解放……。
    通过开展辩论，支委们解放了思想，车间的党员和工人群众展开政治思想上的辩论后，也把疑虑打消了。
    当党支部在订规划、组织辩论的时候，车间一些行政、技术干部也在忙着研究跃进方案。他们计划要增建三个大窑，添买大粉碎机、自动化的鼓风球磨机、碎石机、压砖机、油压机……，经过“精打细算”，投资最少要一百万元。他们一面忙拟方案，一面写信到北京、鞍钢要图纸资料。
    党支部的跃进规划公布后，车间陈工程师和中心试验室专管耐火材料的许工程师看了，都摇头说：“这简直是开玩笑！”许工程师说：“不增任何设备，光靠群众找找窍门，顶多把生产提高点把点，决不能提高一、两倍呀！”
    坚持原则，支持革新
    陈淑春和支委们商量，决定不增加任何设备，紧密依靠老工人，破除陈规，推广“快速烧窑”。
    烧窑工长幸焱卿，找了好些老师傅来仔细研究“快速烧窑”、订出了成套新操作法。当幸焱卿拿着新操作法满心高兴地去找车间陈工程师审批，陈工程师模棱两可地说：“要考虑考虑；……最好拿去找许工程师斟酌斟酌。”
    他在许工程师办公室，费了好多唇舌，许工程师才最后批示：“在小窑上暂作试验”。
    支委会对推行新的操作技术作了详细研究、布置。支书陈淑春和两个支委，都到推广新操作法的大窑上去种试验田；挑选共产党员、有近二十年烧窑经验的老工人王治银在推广中打第一炮。陈淑春对王治银说：第一炮很重要，要打响。王治银察觉她还有一点担忧，便说：“书记，只要你们撑腰就行，推广“快速烧窑”的技术嘛，少说点，80％的把握我是有的。”
    烧窑的新操作法正式试行了，在推行的第一天，王治银在一个窑上干了第一班，又马上跑到另一个窑干第一班，一气便干了十六小时。他和烧窑工人们把原来工程技术人员们规定窑温“在二百度以下每小时温度只能升五到十五度”的烧窑升温曲线，大胆地完全否定了。在烧第一班的八小时内，就把窑温猛烧到四百四十度，窑仍很正常。如果按旧规程，要烧五班、四十小时才能将窑温烧到四百多度。这样，便大大缩短了烧窑时间。
    支委们日日夜夜守在窑上，帮助群众解决问题，和工会干部一起总结经验，组织竞赛。王治银的“三勤”、“三快”烧窑经验刚创造出来，支委们和工会干部连夜总结，第二天便在各窑推广了。党员中、群众中，开展了热火朝天的竞赛，不但很快将原来90％的烧窑技术规程推翻了，还大大修改和充实了新操作法。
    放手大干，打退阻挠
    就在王治银一气干十六小时那天，技术监督人员连填了他八次违反操作规程；监督站长跑来气冲冲地责问他：“你知不知道操作规程是‘厂规厂法’，随便乱搞一通，你要倒霉的！”一向沉默寡言的王治银一声不吭地照样干，心想：你吓不倒我，我是照党支部的正确决定在办事。
    技术监督人员将工人违反操作规程的纪录拿去找烧窑工长幸焱卿签字，幸焱卿不按正规签，便把监督站长气坏了。他指着这位工长的鼻子说：“老幸，操作规程还要不要，你们胡搞乱搞，搞出祸事来谁负责！”幸工长也火了，严厉反驳说：“你们搞技术监督的比我们技术高，不来支持，反来阻挠！出了祸嘛，我们自己承担，那次连累过你们！？”
    一些工程技术人员在群众的创造革新面前感到惶悚不安。许工程师下来，在窑旁转了几转，惊奇而焦急地说：温度烧得太快，太快会出问题，便走了。技术监督科一位科长下来作升温纪录，开始还认真地记，后来看到窑里的火烧得那么熊，窑温像箭弩般上升，吓得把笔一甩，一溜烟跑了。
    有一次，烧窑时窑内工具砖塌了，监督站长马上理直气壮地站出来说话了，他说：“这还是小事故，再乱搞，闹出大事故来，你们要大倒其霉的！”
    还有一次，窑内的少数耐火砖出了点欠温的毛病，工程师们挑了出来，当着支书陈淑春和工人们的面说：“看，这就是快速烧窑的成果嘛。”
    工程技术人员的张惶失措和威吓阻挠，技术监督人员的大肆填写工人违反操作规程，特别是窑上两次小事故的出现，使一部分工人产生了顾虑。因为违反了原来的“厂规厂法”，在竞赛中生产再好，也评不了先进，出了问题，还要受行政处分。一些有顾虑的群众去找陈淑春建议说：书记，我们的新操作法还是“私生子”呀，为什么行政上不早些批下来。
    有一次，许工程师下来，工人们围住他，问他为啥不批准新操作法。
    “没把握呀！应该多试验、试验。”许工程师似觉为难地说。
    “不行，得赶快批。”工人们有点生气了。
    许工程师没法，只好答应马上回去开技术研究会研究。
    在技术研究会上，两位工程师在图书馆里找出大堆耐火材料书籍来研究，认为工人们搞的操作法找不到任何“理论根据”，结论是不能批准。
    不管困难阻挠多大，车间党支部始终依靠群众，坚持推广烧窑新技术。在党委书记的支持下，支部公开宣布：在新操作法试行期间，触犯旧的操作规程不作为竞赛评比条件；出了问题支部承担；并号召大家起来猛攻保守，打退阻挠，放手大干。这样，群众大胆革新技术，各工段和每个生产环节的工人都起来全面实行技术革新，实现了九次重大技术改革，冲破陈规六百七十多项。
    一场风波
    当三窑“快速烧窑”的新砖出来，进行检验鉴定时，引起了一场风波。监督检验人员经过检验鉴定，宣判了这些在新操作法下诞生的耐火砖“不合规格”，绝大部分都该报废。
    这个宣判在全车间甚至全厂传开了，一些一开头就不赞成新操作法的工程师们，这时真是谈吐风生。有的说，我早就说不行嘛，现在，果然！果然！有的说：推广“快速烧窑”应该谨慎，支部这次是操之过急了。
    车间有些群众听说全窑报废，心里很着急，也很难过。
    真的这几窑砖绝大部分都该报废吗？
    在一个有党委书记、厂长、厂部工程师参加的耐火材料车间的现场会议上，支部书记陈淑春起来揭发了所谓绝大部分砖该报废的秘密。她说：车间支部组织了许多有经验的老工人，对几窑砖都进行了分析研究，认为在装窑、掌握窑温等方面是有些小毛病，但决不是推广“快速烧窑”的缘故。这几窑砖有80％、60％以上是合格的，但总是疑惑我们质量有问题的检验人员，不按正常检验办法，在取样时专门挑取少数不具代表性的脆弱砖来检验，并以此作根据判定报废。
    现场会议上，经过厂的党、政领导人和厂部工程师们的研究判定，认为三窑砖是合格品，党委书记并严格批评了片面判定随便浪费国家财产的检验人员。
    大胆破除陈规，革新技术的战斗，给车间带来的生产成果是巨大的：每炉砖的烧窑时间由九十多小时降到十六小时半，烧窑周期由每月三窑一百六十小时提高到每月十窑六十小时，煤耗由每吨砖四百五十公斤降到一百九十二公斤。产品的综合质量由91.63％提高到94.87％。这样，这个车间不仅不需要一百万元的投资，相反为国家多创造了一百七十万元的财富。（附图片）
