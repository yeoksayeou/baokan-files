Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 25th: Cambodian National Radio reported on the 23rd that the Cambodian National Assembly wholeheartedly supports the Cambodian government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

In a resolution passed on the 23rd to the King and Queen, the National Assembly warmly endorsed the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by the government led by Prince Sihanouk. The resolution stated that the Cambodian government has formally recognized the truly independent People's Republic of China, and the 600 million people of the People's Republic of China and their government are selflessly helping us, which is suitable for Cambodia's current and future situation. The resolution said that if this decision of the Cambodian government leads to external aggression, the National Assembly and all the Cambodian people will do their utmost and sacrifice their lives to defend it.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 25th: Washington news: U.S. State Department spokesman White issued a statement on the 24th, expressing "regret" over the Kingdom of Cambodia's action of legally recognizing China, which is a matter of Cambodia's internal affairs.

In the statement, the U.S. State Department had to admit that "the sovereign government of Cambodia has the right to take any steps it deems to be in the national interest of its people"; however, it immediately said that the United States considers the Kingdom of Cambodia's recognition of China to be "regrettable."

White revealed that the U.S. State Department has ordered the U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia to return to Washington to report on the matter.
