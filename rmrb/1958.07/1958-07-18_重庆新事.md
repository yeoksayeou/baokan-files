    New Developments in Chongqing
    Customers eating noodles at the Minzu Road Restaurant in Chongqing have recently found it particularly convenient: as soon as you order a type of noodle, the waiter doesn't need to go to the kitchen; the hot noodles are immediately brought to the table. It turns out that Hu Shuhui, a waiter at this restaurant, installed a conveyor belt using local methods. Bowls of noodles are automatically sent from the kitchen, 25 meters away, to the restaurant like riding a trackless trolley. When it reaches the end, an electric bell rings automatically, telling the waiter: the noodles are here. The conveyor belt is also equipped with signal lights for the waiter to direct the kitchen workers to cook the noodles.
    This is just one of many technical innovation stories in Chongqing's commercial service sector. In the Chongqing Central Department Store, the joint state-private cotton cloth store, banks, grain stores, noodle processing shops, and other units, you can see many machines and tools created by employees to facilitate the masses. The sock sizing stool designed by the employees of the Central Department Store has foot patterns of various sizes drawn on it. Customers can try on the stool to find out what size socks they need to buy simply by stepping on it. The interest calculator created by the employees of the Municipal People's Bank is equipped with four types of interest rate tables, deposit dates, and the number of days. Simply dial the deposit date to show the number of days, then dial the interest rate table to match the number of days, and the interest payable is automatically calculated. This can greatly reduce the waiting time for the masses when withdrawing money. A measuring ruler used by salespersons in cotton cloth retail stores can measure the customer's height and immediately determine how much material needs to be purchased.
    In factories and warehouses affiliated with the finance and trade system, technical innovation examples are also constantly emerging. Employees of the Chongqing Warehousing Company have basically achieved vehicle transportation and mechanization of warehouse handling, and the scientific management of materials storage in less than a month, becoming an advanced unit of technical innovation in the city.
    In the past two months, 80,000 employees in Chongqing's finance and trade system, focusing on facilitating the masses and promoting production development, have launched a major technical innovation competition. Currently, more than 34,000 inventions and technical innovations have been realized. (Xu Yidao)

专栏：财贸系统开展技术革新

    重庆新事
    在重庆民族路餐厅吃面食的顾客，最近特别感到方便：当你刚点定吃那种面时，招待员不用走到厨房，便马上把热腾腾的面端上了餐桌。原来这个餐厅的服务员胡树辉用土办法安装了一条传送带，一碗碗的面食像乘无轨电车一样从二十五公尺外的厨房自动送到餐厅，到了终点站时，电铃自动响了，告诉招待员：面送来了。传送带上还装有讯号灯，供招待员指挥厨工煮面。
    这不过是重庆市商业服务部门许多技术革新事迹中的一个。在重庆中心百货零售商店、公私合营棉布商店、银行和粮店、制面加工店等单位，都可以看到职工们为便利群众而创造的不少机器和工具。中心百货商店职工设计的袜子量码凳上，画有各种号码的脚样，顾客只要一踏上量码凳就可试出自己需要买多大号码的袜子。市人民银行职工创造的一种利息计算机，上面装有四种利率表、存入日期、天数等，只要拨动存入日期，即现出天数，再对准天数拨动利率表，应付的利息数就自动计算出来了。这就可以大大减少群众取款时等候的时间。棉布零售店售货员使用的一种估量尺，只要一量顾客的身长，就可以看出来需要买多少衣料。
    在财贸系统附属的工厂和仓库，技术革新事例也屡出不穷。重庆仓储公司的职工在不到一个月，已基本上实现仓库搬运车子化、机械化、物资保管科学化，成为全市技术革新的先进单位。
    最近两个月中，重庆市财贸系统八万名职工，围绕便利广大群众、促进生产发展，开展了技术革新大竞赛，目前实现的创造发明和革新技术事例达三万四千多件。　（徐宜道）
