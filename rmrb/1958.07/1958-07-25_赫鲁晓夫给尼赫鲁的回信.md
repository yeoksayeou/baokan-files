    Khrushchev's Reply to Nehru
    Esteemed Prime Minister:
    Your letter was delivered to me on July 21st by Indian Ambassador Mr. Menon. On behalf of the Soviet government, I express my gratitude to you and the Indian government for your prompt reply. We are also pleased to know that our views on the recent situation in the Near and Middle East coincide, as do our views on the need to take urgent measures and eliminate the current international crisis through negotiations. We are pleased to learn that the Indian government agrees to participate in a summit meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, India, the United States, Britain, and France.
    I inform you, Prime Minister, that I have received replies from Mr. Eisenhower, Mr. Macmillan, and Mr. de Gaulle to my letter of July 19th.
    We can accept British Prime Minister Macmillan's proposal to convene a summit meeting of the heads of government within the framework of the Security Council. The Soviet government already pointed out in its letter of July 19th that it believes the Security Council should not be bypassed. It can be seen from the letters of Mr. Eisenhower and Mr. de Gaulle that they also expressed their willingness to hold talks between heads of government.
    In view of the need to take urgent decisions to maintain peace, we believe that the form of the summit meeting is not of decisive significance in this situation. What is important is to hold such a meeting as soon as possible in order to find the right solutions to maintain and consolidate peace, stabilize the situation in the Near and Middle East, and ease international tensions.
    We agree with Mr. Macmillan that no resolutions should be introduced at this special meeting of the Security Council without prior consultation, and that the purpose of the meeting is to reach agreement, not to determine differences through voting.
    The Soviet government's starting point here is that the heads of government will be able to conduct not just formal joint consultations, but also those which will lead to the quickest and most constructive solutions conducive to maintaining and consolidating peace.
    Since the Security Council is currently discussing issues of particular importance from the perspective of maintaining peace and ensuring security, rather than general daily issues, we believe that India's participation in the Security Council meeting would be beneficial, as it is a major Asian country and is recognized as a nation advocating the consolidation of peace.
    We sincerely thank the Indian government for agreeing to participate in the summit meeting to discuss the situation in the Near and Middle East, and we believe that it would be very beneficial if you, Prime Minister, personally represented India at the Security Council meeting.
    In view of your agreement, and the agreement of British Prime Minister Macmillan, French Republic Prime Minister de Gaulle, and US President Eisenhower (as can be seen from his letter of the 22nd), the Soviet Union will be represented at this meeting by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.
    It goes without saying that the governments of the relevant Arab countries should be included in the discussions of the heads of government of the aforementioned five countries in the Security Council.
    The Soviet government hopes to learn as soon as possible the Indian government's opinion on the date of convening the Security Council with the participation of heads of government. We propose that the Security Council meeting be held in New York on July 28.
    We are confident that India's active participation in this meeting will help stop the conflict in the Near and Middle East and stop the threat to universal peace.
        With sincere respect,
            N. Khrushchev

### 赫鲁晓夫给尼赫鲁的回信

专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫给尼赫鲁的回信尊敬的总理先生：
    您的信已在7月21日由印度大使梅农先生转交给我。我代表苏联政府向您和印度政府对您的迅速回信表示谢意，我们还满意地知道了，对近日来中近东局势的看法我们是吻合的，对必须采取紧急措施、通过谈判来消除目前的国际危机的看法也是吻合的。我们高兴地获悉，印度政府同意参加苏联、印度、美国、英国和法国五国政府首脑会议。
    我通知您，总理先生，我收到了艾森豪威尔先生、麦克米伦先生和戴高乐先生对我7月19日去信的回信。
    英国首相麦克米伦先生提出的关于在安全理事会范围内召开政府首脑会议的主张，我们是可以接受的。苏联政府在7月19日的信中已经指出：苏联政府认为，不应该避开安全理事会。从艾森豪威尔先生和戴高乐先生的信中可以看出他们也表示愿意举行政府首脑会谈。
    鉴于必须采取紧急决定来维护和平，我们认为，政府首脑会议的形式在这种情况下没有决定性的意义。而重要的是尽早地举行这种会议，以便尽快地找出正确的解决办法来维护和巩固和平，安定中近东地区的局面，缓和国际紧张局势。
    我们同意麦克米伦先生的意见：在安理会这次特别会议上不应当提出未经事先商妥的任何决议案，会议的目的是取得协议，而不是通过表决确定分歧。
    苏联政府这里的出发点是，各国政府首脑为了取得有利于维护和巩固和平的最迅速的建设性解决办法，将有可能进行不仅只是正式程序的共同协商。
    既然当前安理会要讨论的不是一般的日常问题，而是从维护和平和保障安全的角度看来特别重要的问题，因而我们认为，印度参加安理会会议会是有好处的，因为它是一个亚洲大国，是被公认为主张巩固和平的国家。
    我们衷心感谢印度政府同意参加讨论中近东局势问题的政府首脑会议，同时我们认为，您，总理先生亲自代表印度参加安理会会议，那是很有好处的。
    鉴于您同意，英国首相麦克米伦先生、法兰西共和国总理戴高乐先生和美国总统艾森豪威尔先生也同意（从他的22日的信中可以看出），苏联将由苏联部长会议主席作为代表出席这次会议。
    不言而喻，上述五国政府首脑在安全理事会中讨论问题时，应当吸收有关阿拉伯国家政府参加。
    苏联政府希望能尽快地获知印度政府对召开有政府首脑参加的安全理事会的日期的意见。我们建议安全理事会会议7月28日在纽约举行。
    我们确信，印度积极参加这次会议将有助于停止中近东冲突和停止对普遍和平的威胁。
        致诚挚的敬意
            尼·赫鲁晓夫
