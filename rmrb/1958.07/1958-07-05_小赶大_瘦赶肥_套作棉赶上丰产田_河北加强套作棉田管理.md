Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 4th: Farmers in various parts of Hebei are strengthening the field management of intercropped cotton.

Hebei Province has sown over 15 million mu of cotton this year, of which cotton-wheat intercropping accounts for approximately 4 million mu. In the previous period, due to the influence of wheat, the development and growth were generally weak. Coupled with recent drought and cotton aphid infestations, some areas experienced serious seedling death in intercropped cotton fields. Under these circumstances, various localities have adopted revolutionary measures, giving this type of cotton field special "preferential treatment." The Handan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the growth of over 3 million mu of cotton in the entire region, conducted a classified ranking. Under the slogan of "Small catches up to big, lean catches up to fat, intercropping cotton catches up to high-yielding fields," they particularly strengthened the management of second and third-class cotton seedlings, including watering, cultivating, pest control, and topdressing. Cheng'an County organized 3,100 water carts to irrigate over 17,000 mu of intercropped cotton fields, and at the same time organized a professional pest control team of 15,000 people, who treated 350,000 mu of cotton fields for pests in three days. In Wuqiao County, after 50,000 laborers worked intensely on watering, pest control, cultivating, and topdressing of 300,000 mu of intercropped cotton fields, the growth of cotton seedlings began to improve, and some cotton seedlings that were about to wither grew new leaves.

    河北加强套作棉田管理
    新华社天津4日电　河北各地农民加强套作棉花的田间管理。
    河北省今年播种一千五百多万亩棉花，其中棉麦间作约有四百万亩。前一段由于受到小麦的影响，发育生长一般都很瘦弱，加上近来干旱和棉蚜为害，一些地区套作棉花发生严重死苗现象。在这种情况下，各地采取了革命措施，特别“优待”这种棉田。中共邯郸地委根据全区三百多万亩棉花生长情况，进行了分类排队，在“小赶大、瘦赶肥、套作棉赶上丰产田”的口号下，特别加强对二、三类棉苗的浇水、中耕、除虫、追肥等管理工作，成安县组织三千一百多辆水车，浇灌了一万七千多亩套作棉田，同时组织一万五千人的专业除虫大队，三天中把三十五万亩棉花的虫害治了一遍。吴桥县三十万亩套作棉田，经过全县五万劳动力紧张浇水、除虫、中耕、追肥以后，棉苗生长情况开始好转，有些快要枯死的棉苗又长出了新叶。（附图片）
