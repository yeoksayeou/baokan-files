Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 28th: The documents adopted by the special meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions on the 26th and 27th were published here this afternoon.

The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, in a letter to workers and trade unions worldwide, called on them to intensify resolute action against imperialist pressure on Arab countries and to strive for the immediate withdrawal of American and British troops from the Middle East.

The document also calls on workers and trade unions in all countries to maintain maximum vigilance, strengthen and unite their efforts to defend peace, ensure the withdrawal of aggressors from all Arab countries, and use various effective methods appropriate to their national conditions.

In a letter to workers and trade unions in Arab countries, the Executive Committee warmly welcomes the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people and the significant victories achieved by the Arab people in the anti-aggression struggle. The letter points out, "Due to your continuous victories, the Baghdad Pact has been fundamentally undermined; therefore, you have made a great contribution to the cause of world peace."

The letter also emphasizes that the World Federation of Trade Unions and its affiliated organizations will support the struggle of Arab workers until they achieve complete victory.

In a telegram to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, the Executive Committee strongly protested the actions of the US and British governments in undermining the UN Charter and believes that the relevant UN bodies should remind the governments of these two countries to abide by the Charter. The telegram points out that the World Federation of Trade Unions firmly demands the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon, Jordan, and Libya, and firmly demands and expresses support for an immediate summit conference of the governments of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and India.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 27th: The special meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions held in Prague closed on the 27th. Before the meeting concluded, Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, made a concluding speech. He emphasized that the representatives were unanimous in their opinions during the two days of discussion, and these unanimous opinions included the opinions of the representative of the Arab Trade Union International Federation, which made this consensus even more valuable.

Saillant called on the people of all countries to continue to strive for the convening of a top-level meeting. He also pointed out the enormous danger of the Adenauer government allowing the United States to use West German airports as transit stations for military aircraft flying to the Near and Middle East.

Saillant concluded by pointing out that the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan should be the dominant slogan in the coming period.

During the two days of discussions, representatives from China, the United Arab Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, France, Italy, and other countries spoke. Zhu Xuefan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech on the 26th that the Chinese people strongly oppose the aggression of US and British imperialism in the Near and Middle East and vigorously support the struggle of the Arab people.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 29th: Arab Trade Union International Federation representative Hakim said in a speech published in Prague newspapers on the 28th that during the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt, Middle Eastern oil workers cut off oil pipelines in various regions. He said that if the United States and Britain do not stop their current aggression against Arab countries, "we will take the same action."

Hakim said at the special meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions held here on the 27th that we are determined to eliminate imperialism in all Arab countries. He said that the Arab people's refusal to allow imperialists to use Arab territory to achieve their intentions is a contribution to the cause of peace.

Hakim said that the Arab people will continue the struggle for national liberation until victory, which imperialism cannot stop.

    在致阿拉伯各国工人和工会书中，执行委员会热烈欢迎伊拉克人民的英勇斗争，欢迎阿拉伯人民在反侵略斗争中所获得的重大胜利。书中指出，“由于你们的连续的胜利，巴格达条约遭到根本的破坏；因此你们对世界和平的事业作出了巨大的贡献”。
