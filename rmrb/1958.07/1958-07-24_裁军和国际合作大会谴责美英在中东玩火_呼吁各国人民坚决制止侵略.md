Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm: The Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference closed on the 22nd, and adopted three documents: An Appeal to the People of All Countries of the World on the Middle East Situation, the Appeal of the Conference, and the Declaration on Disarmament. (See page 5 for the full text of the above) These documents all expressed deep concern about the Middle East situation.

The Appeal of the Conference pointed out: The unwarranted military intervention by the United States and Britain in the Middle East threatens the whole world with nuclear war. We issue a solemn appeal to the people and governments of all countries:

    Foreign troops in the Middle East must withdraw immediately to end armed intervention in the Middle East.

The conference believes that "a summit meeting must be convened so that the first step on the road to international cooperation can be taken."

The Conference's "Appeal to the People of All Countries of the World on the Middle East Situation" reads:

    "The people of the world are facing a serious threat of war. This threat is increasing day by day.
    Now there is an urgent need for the people to make their voices heard, lest the opportunity be missed.
    After the invasion of Lebanon by the United States armed forces, British troops then entered Jordan and were sent to Libya.
    The United States, Britain, and Turkey are preparing plans for further aggression in the Middle East.
    These actions risk turning the Middle East into a battlefield and threaten peace throughout the world.
    Neither from a legal basis nor from a moral basis can the aggression that is taking place in the Middle East, in violation of the United Nations Charter, be justified.
    The conference points out: The solemn obligation of the people of all countries is to quickly, actively, and resolutely stop this aggression and safeguard peace in the Middle East and the world."

After voting on and adopting the above three major documents, the conference then decided to authorize Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru to handle the appeal to the United Nations and the UN Secretary-General regarding the US-British armed intervention in the Middle East, which was adopted by the conference on July 20.

Professor John Bernal, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council and a famous British scientist, delivered the closing address. He said that the conference had given us new strength to fight for peace. The discussions at the conference were valuable not only for the participants but also for the entire peace movement. The mutual understanding reached at the conference demonstrated its great success. Bernal emphasized the need to carry out the peace movement more widely throughout the world in order to achieve disarmament and international cooperation.

Speaking of the situation in the Near and Middle East, Bernal said that the Soviet Union has taken decisive steps to maintain peace and safeguard the national independence of Middle Eastern countries. Participants in the conference expressed their admiration for the Soviet Union's peace policy with warm applause.

The conference was adjourned at 2:00 PM.

    裁军和国际合作大会谴责美英在中东玩火
    呼吁各国人民坚决制止侵略
    本报讯　据新华社斯德哥尔摩消息：裁军和国际合作大会于22日闭幕，通过了三个文件，这三项文件是：关于中东局势的告世界各国人民书、大会的呼吁书和裁军宣言。（以上全文见第五版）这些文件都表示了对中东局势的深切关怀。
    大会的呼吁书中指出：美国和英国在中东的无端的军事干涉行为使全世界面临着核战争的威胁。我们向各国人民和政府发出庄严的呼吁：
    中东的外国军队必须立即撤出以结束对中东的武装干涉行为。
    大会认为“最高级会议必须召开，使得在国际合作的道路上迈开第一步成为可能。”
    大会“关于中东局势的告世界各国人民书”中写道：
    “世界人民面临着严重的战争威胁。这种威胁正在与日俱增。
    现在迫切需要人民发出自己的呼声，以免坐失时机。
    在美国武装部队侵略黎巴嫩以后，英国军队紧接着开进了约旦，派到了利比亚。
    美国、英国和土耳其正在准备在中东进行进一步侵略的计划。
    这些行动有使中东沦为战场的危险，并且威胁着全世界的和平。
    无论法律根据还是从道义根据来说，中东所发生的违反联合国宪章的侵略都是无法辩解的。
    大会指出：一切国家的人民的庄严义务就是要迅速、积极、坚决地制止这种侵略、维护中东和世界的和平。”
    大会在表决和通过了上述三项主要文件后，接着决定授权拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人处理大会7月20日通过的为美英武装干涉中东致联合国和联合国秘书处的呼吁书。
    世界和平理事会副主席、著名英国科学家约翰·贝尔纳教授致闭幕词。他说，大会赋予我们为和平而斗争的新的力量。大会的讨论不但对于会议参加者，而且对于整个和平运动都是很有价值的。会上所达到的相互谅解表明了大会的极大成功。贝尔纳强调说，有必要在全世界更广泛地开展和平运动来争取实现裁军和国际合作。
    贝尔纳在谈到中近东的局势时说，苏联已经采取了维护和平和维护中东国家民族独立的决定性的步骤。参加大会的人以热烈的掌声表示对苏联和平政策的敬佩。
    大会在下午二时宣告闭幕。
