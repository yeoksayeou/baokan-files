Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 29th: Tianjin established a "Dye-Free Dyeing Research Lab" on the 27th.

The task of this research lab is to organize people with inventions and practical experience, exchange experiences, systematically study methods of dyeing various materials without dyes, try to find a full color spectrum, and ensure that the finished product's fastness meets national standards.

The research lab is staffed by a group of technical innovation activists in dye-free dyeing as full-time researchers. Liang Shukai is a young technician at the Tianjin Weaving and Dyeing Factory. During the Great Leap Forward, he used the chemical components of silk fibers themselves and the method of coupling with certain metal salts to dye silk into various colors such as coffee and sky blue without dyes. Xiao Dexun, a worker at the Jinan Tannery, also succeeded in trial-producing leather in blue, beige, dark camel, and light camel colors without dyes. Liu Guiwen and Xu Youde, technicians at the Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory, transformed woolen yarn into yellow, brown, and pink through processing.

    天津设立不用染料染色研究室
    据新华社天津29日电　天津市在27日成立了“不用染料染色研究室”。
    这个研究室的任务是把有发明创造和实践经验的人组织起来，交流经验，系统研究各种物质不用染料染色的方法，设法找全色谱，并使成品牢度达到国家标准。
    研究室由一批不用染料染色的技术革新积极分子担任专职研究员。梁树楷是天津织染厂的青年技术员，在大跃进中，他利用丝绸纤维本身的化学成分和某种金属盐偶合的方法，不用染料把丝绸染成咖啡色、天蓝色等多种颜色。津南制革厂工人萧德训也研究不用染料试制蓝色、米色、深驼色和浅驼色的皮革成功。东亚毛麻纺织厂的技术员刘桂文和徐有德，经过处理，把毛线变成黄色、棕色、粉色。
