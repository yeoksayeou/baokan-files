Jiamusi, July 27th (reporter from this newspaper) — In the great leap forward in production, the Jiamusi Integrated Pulp and Paper Mill has established 43 satellite factories, including those producing cement, instruments, alcohol, wood distillation products, heat-resistant concrete bricks, wire nails and welding rods, miscellaneous goods processing, carbon black, rubber, wood processing, electrolytic copper, and small-scale papermaking machinery. Fifteen of these factories have already gone into production.

The establishment of these small satellite factories fully demonstrates their superiority. In the past, the electrolytic copper required by this factory had always depended on supplies from the Shenyang Electrolytic Copper Plant, which was costly and inconvenient to use. After the establishment of the small electrolytic copper plant, all products can be self-supplied. It is estimated that the 15 small factories that have already started production in the whole factory can create 10 million yuan of wealth for the country annually.

The experience of this factory proves that running satellite factories on a large scale is an important way to fully mobilize the internal positive factors of enterprises and achieve the best use of talent, materials, and equipment. The Jiamusi Integrated Pulp and Paper Mill is China's first and largest factory producing industrial paper. Due to the factory's advanced equipment, high degree of automation, single product, and complex technology, there was an uneven phenomenon of busy main workshops and slack auxiliary workshops, high utilization rate of main equipment, and low utilization rate of auxiliary equipment. Because the factory is large and the material requirements are strict, a large amount of materials cannot be fully utilized. The establishment of satellite factories allows the rich potential hidden in the enterprise to be brought into play.

The establishment of these satellite factories fully embodies the principle of "relying on the masses, making do with whatever is available" in running enterprises diligently and thriftily. The equipment of the satellite factories is all solved by using idle and surplus equipment from the large factory, and using the stagnant materials and waste materials from the large factory as raw materials. The method to solve the labor force for small factories is: ① Extracting manpower during the spare time of production in the large factory. ② Through technological innovation, improve labor productivity and transfer the saved manpower. As much as possible, organize family members of employees to participate in the production of satellite factories.

After the establishment of small factories, everyone paid more attention to tapping the potential of the enterprise, the workers were full of energy, and vigorously carried out technical revolutions, and production targets were constantly broken through, and new miracles in production continued to emerge.

### 人尽其才、物尽其用、设备尽其能  佳木斯造纸厂大办卫星厂

    人尽其才、物尽其用、设备尽其能
    佳木斯造纸厂大办卫星厂
    本报哈尔滨27日电　佳木斯综合制浆造纸厂在生产大跃进中建立起水泥、仪表、酒精、木材干馏、耐热混凝土砖、洋钉焊条制造、杂品加工、炭黑、橡胶、木材加工、电解铜和小型造纸机制造等四十三个卫星工厂，其中有十五个厂已投入生产。
    这些小卫星工厂的建立，充分显示它的优越性。过去，这个厂所需要的电解铜，一向依赖沈阳电解铜厂供应，成本高，使用不方便，小型电解铜厂建立后，产品全部可以自给。全厂已开工生产的十五个小厂，估计全年可以为国家创造一千万元的财富。
    这个厂的经验证明，大办卫星厂，是充分调动企业内部的积极因素，作到人尽其才、物尽其用、设备尽其能的一个重要的途径。佳木斯综合制浆造纸厂，是我国第一座规模最大的、生产工业用纸的工厂。由于这个厂具有设备先进、自动化程度高、产品单一、技术复杂等特点，就产生了主要车间任务紧张、辅助车间松懈、主要设备利用率高、辅助设备利用率低的忙闲不均的现象；由于厂子大，材料要求严格，大量的物资也不能充分利用。建立卫星厂就使企业里蕴藏的丰富潜力得到发挥。
    这些卫星厂的建立，充分体现了“依靠群众，因陋就简”的勤俭办企业的方针。卫星厂的设备，全部利用大厂闲置和多余的设备解决，利用大厂的呆滞物资和废料作原料。小厂解决劳动力的办法是：①在大厂生产闲余时间抽出人力解决。②通过技术革新，提高劳动生产率，把节约的人力调出来。尽可能的组织职工家属参加卫星厂生产。
    建立小工厂后，由于大家更注意挖掘企业潜力，工人干劲足，大搞技术革命，生产指标不断被突破，生产上新的奇迹不断涌现。
