Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 22nd: Iraqi Republic Deputy Prime Minister Arif, when meeting with Middle East News Agency General Manager Hinnawi in Baghdad on July 22nd, stated that the Iraqi Republic's domestic mission is to eliminate all corrupt and decadent elements, so that the people can escape all the disasters they have suffered in the past and live noble and happy lives.

The Deputy Prime Minister, who also serves as Minister of Interior, said that the Iraqi revolutionary government will soon announce steps to realize social justice. He explained that the Iraqi revolution is built on a deep belief in the will of the people, and the people's interests and future are the primary tasks of the revolution. He pointed out that the imperialist vested interest groups have deepened and cultivated divisions among the people in order to split the national ranks and disperse its strength. The revolution has a huge plan aimed at eliminating these divisions.

Arif said that Iraq's foreign policy will be determined based on its national interests—this policy is to pursue a free Arab policy in cooperation with Arab brother countries, in order to complete Iraq's desire for freedom and unity.

He added: "We will strive for peace through a policy of active neutrality and non-involvement, and strive to save the world from the scourge of war."

Arif also said that Iraq's future plans to increase Iraqi resources will be formulated based on a new policy aimed at fundamentally changing the government's attitude towards development policies. The new government will spare no effort to develop natural resources such as sulfur.

He expressed concern for the Arabs who are still struggling in many parts of the Arab world. He said: "The resources of the Iraqi Republic are being gathered to serve the Arab cause and realize our goals of unity, freedom, and social justice."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 22nd: Iraqi Republic Radio announced on July 22nd that the Iraqi cabinet discussed the draft temporary constitution of the Iraqi Republic on the evening of July 21st.

The radio also said that the Iraqi authorities announced that a special supreme military tribunal will soon begin trying traitors. The authorities requested the Iraqi people to hand over any information and documents they have regarding treason cases for investigation.

The radio also said that all schools, hospitals, and health institutions in Iraq named after the royal family have been renamed.

The radio also announced that the Iraqi Republic has issued an order prohibiting the transfer or mortgage of stocks and savings of companies and joint-stock companies unless with the special permission of the relevant authorities.

The radio said that a delegation from the All-Palestine Government arrived in Baghdad and informed the Iraqi Foreign Minister that Palestine recognizes the Iraqi Republic. The head of the delegation said that they requested the Iraqi authorities to agree to Palestinian youth joining the Iraqi army.

The All-Palestine Government, headquartered in Cairo, was formed in 1948 based on a decision of the Arab League.
