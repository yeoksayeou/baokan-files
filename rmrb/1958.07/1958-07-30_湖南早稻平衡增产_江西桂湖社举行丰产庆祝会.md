Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 29th: Hunan Province has already harvested and threshed 5,034,000 mu of early rice, with an average yield of 601 jin of dried grain per mu, an increase of 228 jin per mu compared to last year. Currently, townships and cooperatives with average yields of over 1,000 jin per mu, and small-area bumper harvest records of 4,000 to 5,000 jin, are constantly emerging.

This year, Hunan Province planted a total of 21,082,000 mu of early rice. Judging from the harvested areas, this year's bumper harvest is characterized by neat seedlings and balanced yields. Whether in plains, hills, or large mountainous areas, all are advancing in leaps and bounds. In the Chen County area, north and south of the Five Ridges, where the season started earlier, 1,470,000 mu of early rice have been completely harvested, with an average yield of 561 jin of dried grain per mu, doubling the yield of last year. The Shaoyang area, which has historically suffered from severe drought, has achieved a bumper harvest on 2,450,000 mu of early rice this year due to vigorous water conservancy construction. More than 700,000 mu have already been threshed, with an average yield of 653 jin of dried grain per mu, an increase of 302 jin per mu compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Poyang, July 29th: The Guihu Agricultural Cooperative in Poyang County, Jiangxi Province, held a grand celebration on the 28th to celebrate its highest record of 9,195 jin and 13 liang per mu of early rice.

More than 1,000 people attended the meeting, including all members of the Guihu Agricultural Cooperative and Party secretaries and representatives of agricultural cooperatives from various districts and townships in Poyang County.

The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Provincial People's Committee, the Shangrao Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shangrao Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and the Poyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee all sent representatives to congratulate and award a banner to the cooperative.

Wang Dachuan, representative of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee, and Minister of the Provincial Department of Rural Work, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting.

At the request of representatives from various regions, Huang Heqing, director of the Guihu Agricultural Cooperative and leader of the high-yield experimental field, introduced their experience in achieving high yields.

After the meeting, representatives from various regions visited the Guihu Cooperative's experimental fields and had detailed discussions with the members of the Guihu Cooperative about the experience in achieving high yields, preparing to promote it in late rice production after returning.

    据新华社长沙29日电　湖南省已经收割脱粒的五百零三万四千亩早稻，平均每亩收干谷六百零一斤，比去年每亩增产二百二十八斤。目前，平均亩产一千斤以上的乡、社和四、五千斤的小面积丰产纪录正在不断出现。
    湖南省今年共种植二千一百零八万二千亩早稻，从已经收割的情况看来，今年丰收的特点是禾苗整齐，产量均衡，不论平原、丘陵以及大山区，都在齐头跃进。季节较早的五岭南北一带的郴县专区，一百四十七万亩早稻已经收割完毕，平均每亩收干谷五百六十一斤，比去年增产一倍。历来遭受严重干旱威胁的邵阳专区，今年由于大力兴修水利，使全区二百四十五万亩早稻获得丰收。已经脱粒的七十多万亩，平均每亩收干谷六百五十三斤，较去年每亩增产三百零二斤。
    据新华社波阳29日电　江西省波阳县桂湖农业社28日举行早稻高额丰产庆祝大会，庆祝早稻亩产九千一百九十五斤十三两的最高纪录。
    参加大会的有桂湖农业社的全体社员和波阳县各区、乡的党委书记、各农业社代表共一千多人。
    中共江西省委、省人民委员会、中共上饶地委、上饶专署、中共波阳县委、县人民委员会也都派代表赶来祝贺，并向这个社授奖旗。
    中共江西省委、省人民委员会代表、省委农村工作部部长王大川在会上致词祝贺。
    在各地代表的要求下，高额丰产试验田的领导者、桂湖农业社主任黄河清介绍了他们的丰产经验。
    会后，各地代表参观了桂湖社的试验田，并与桂湖社的社员们仔细座谈了丰产经验，准备回去后在晚稻上推广。
