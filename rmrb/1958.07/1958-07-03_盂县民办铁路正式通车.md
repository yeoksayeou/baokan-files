Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 2nd: Yu County's privately-run railway in Shanxi has officially opened to traffic on the 1st, after nearly a month of trial operation.

On this day, Yu County held a celebration rally with over four thousand people, and the mountainous area of Yu County, which was once known as a poor mountain, was filled with unprecedented excitement. Before dawn, workers, farmers, rural girls and female students wearing colorful calico summer clothes poured in from all directions. At eight o'clock, Zhao Rui, the first secretary of the Yu County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, cut the ribbon. The "People No. 1" train, carrying coking coal, departed from the Yu County Coking Plant and headed towards the Yu County Power Machinery Repair Plant. The train ran very smoothly, and there was no vibration even when passing over small bridges and high slopes. It traveled three li and three in eight minutes, reaching its destination. The masses applauded and cheered happily.

The locomotive of Yu County's privately-run railway is converted from a seventy-five horsepower automobile. The traction force is much greater than before. There is still great potential to pull six carriages. Each carriage has a load capacity of more than three tons.

    盂县民办铁路正式通车
    据新华社太原2日电  山西盂县民办铁路，经过近一个月的试行，已在1日正式通车。
    这天，盂县召开了四千多人的庆祝通车大会，一向被人们称为穷山的盂县山区盛况空前。天没有亮，工人、农民和穿着花布夏装的农村姑娘、女学生就从四面八方涌来。八时，中共盂县县委第一书记赵锐剪了采。“人民第一号”火车拉着焦炭，从盂县焦厂驶向盂县动力机械修造厂。火车行驶很平稳，经过小桥、高坡也不震动。八分钟，驶过三华里三，到达了终点。群众高兴地鼓掌欢呼。
    盂县民办铁路的机车是用七十五马力的汽车改装的。牵引力比原来增大了很多。拉六节车厢还有很大潜力。车厢每个载重三吨多。
