Xinhua News Agency, July 18th—The extraordinary flood peak of the Yellow River has passed Huayuankou and is flowing downstream. A million-strong flood prevention army on both banks of the river is continuing to fight the flood.

The reporter learned from the Central Flood Control Headquarters: The highest flood peak at Huayuankou appeared at 23:30 on the 17th, with a flow rate of 21,000 cubic meters per second and a water level of 94.39 meters. After the highest flood peak passed, the water level at Huayuankou began to fall slowly. By 0:30 on the 18th, the flow rate had decreased to 20,500 cubic meters per second. By 20:00, the flow rate at Huayuankou was only 7,000 cubic meters per second.

Currently, the flood peak has passed Dongbatou in Lankao County and is advancing towards Gaocun in Dongming County. At 21:30, the flow rate at Gaocun Station had reached 15,400 cubic meters per second.

The maximum flow rate at Huayuankou this time far exceeds the highest flow rate of 15,000 cubic meters per second in 1954 since liberation and is roughly the same as the highest flow rate of 22,000 cubic meters per second at Shanzhou Station in 1933.

Due to the massive flood, the beach areas inside the dikes on both banks of the Yellow River have been inundated this time. Rural areas in the beach area had made full flood prevention preparations in advance, and under the leadership of the Party and the government, farmers safely evacuated the beach area before the flood arrived.

In the river sections where the flood peak has passed, the dikes and flood prevention dams on both banks, under the close watch of the flood prevention army day and night, have not experienced any serious dangers.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 18th—Party and government organizations in Henan and Shandong provinces are leading a million-strong flood prevention force along the river with full confidence to fight the flood, determined to resolutely defend and conquer the flood with a week of hard work.

It is expected that the flood peak will reach Sunkou Station in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, by the 21st.

Since the Yellow River came under the control of the people, dikes have been extensively repaired every year. In addition, with a million-strong flood prevention force closely guarding the river this time, when the extraordinary flood peak passed the Yellow River Bridge of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, Huayuankou, and Kaifeng, the dikes and dams withstood the flood and remained stable.

After receiving the water situation forecast of this extraordinary flood, all localities immediately implemented full Party mobilization and full public mobilization, and immediately engaged in the struggle against the flood overnight. Wu Zhipu, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee and Director of the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters, and Wang Huayun, Deputy Director of the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters, successively inspected flood control work on the Yellow River levee. Party and government leaders at all levels along the river also rushed to the levee line overnight to lead flood control efforts. In the important dike sections, every one to two li has two to three hundred flood prevention personnel monitoring the water situation day and night. There are even more people participating in the defense of the dike sections with water diversion gates. Geng Qichang, Secretary of the Xinxiang Prefectural Party Committee, led more than 4,000 people to defend and reinforce the head gate of the Jihui Irrigation Canal, which diverts water from the Yellow River.

Since the beginning of the flood season, the Henan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and troops stationed in Henan have participated in the preparatory work for flood prevention on the Yellow River. After receiving the news of the extraordinary flood in the Yellow River on the 17th, more than 6,000 officers and soldiers immediately joined the struggle against the flood overnight. They worked with the masses to reinforce dikes and repair roads.

While rescuing and defending dikes, various localities dispatched thousands of vehicles and thousands of boats to help residents living in the river beach areas evacuate to safe areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 18th—At 1:50 pm on the 17th, when the Yellow River Huayuankou experienced an extraordinary flood with a flow rate of 21,000 cubic meters per second, the No. 11 pier of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway Yellow River Bridge was washed away. More than 1,000 railway employees and bridge construction teams have rushed to repair it.

Trains on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway are temporarily rerouted via the Longhai Railway to the Jinpu Railway.

The Yellow River Bridge was built in 1904 and had long exceeded its safe service life. It was reinforced and continued to be used after liberation.

    黄河特大洪峰过了花园口
    河南山东人民决心苦战一周战胜洪水
    据新华社18日讯　黄河的特大洪峰已经经过花园口下泄。两岸堤上的百万防汛大军还在继续和洪水战斗。
    记者从中央防汛总指挥部获悉：花园口的最高洪峰出现在17日二十三时三十分，流量为二万一千秒公方，水位为九四点三九公尺。最高洪峰过去后，花园口水位即开始缓落，到18日零时三十分，流量下降为二万零五百秒公方。到二十时，花园口流量仅七千秒公方。
    现在，洪峰已过兰考县东坝头，向东明县高村推进。二十一时三十分，高村站流量已达一万五千四百秒公方。
    这次花园口的最大流量远超过了解放以来1954年的最高流量一万五千秒公方，而和1933年陕州站的最高流量二万二千秒公方差不多。
    由于洪水太大，黄河两岸的堤内滩地这次都上了水。滩区农村事前都作了充分的防汛准备，农民都在洪水到来以前在党和政府的领导下安全地撤出了滩区。
    洪峰已经的河段，两岸堤防和防汛埽坝等工程，在防汛大军日夜严密防守下尚未发生严重的险情。
    据新华社郑州18日电　河南和山东两省党政机关正领导沿河百万防汛队伍满怀信心地和洪水搏斗，决定坚决防守，苦战一周，战胜洪水。
    预计洪峰至21日即将到达山东省寿张县孙口站。
    黄河自归人民治理以来，连年大修堤坝；又加上这次有百万防汛队伍严密防守，特大洪峰通过京广铁路黄河大桥、花园口、开封时，堤线和坝埽都抗住了洪水侵袭，稳固无事。
    沿河得到这次特大洪水的水情预报后，立即实行全党动员、全民动员，连夜投入和洪水的斗争。中共河南省委第一书记、黄河防汛总指挥部主任吴芝圃、黄河防汛总指挥部副主任王化云相继到黄河大堤上视察防汛工作，沿河的各级党政领导同志也都星夜赶到堤线上领导防汛。重要堤段每一至二里内，即有二、三百名防汛队伍日夜监视水情，有引水闸的堤段，参加防守的人更多。引黄灌溉济卫渠首闸有中共新乡地委书记耿其昌领导四千多人防守和抢修加固工程。
    中国人民解放军河南军区和驻河南部队自入汛期以来就参加了黄河防汛的准备工作，17日得到黄河发生特大洪水消息后，有六千多官兵连夜投入和洪水的斗争中。他们和群众一道加固堤坝，抢修道路。
    各地在抢险和防守堤坝的同时，出动上千的车辆，上千只的船，帮助居住在河滩地区的居民转移到安全地带。
    新华社郑州18日电　17日晚一时五十分，黄河花园口出现二万一千秒公方流量的特大洪水时，京广铁路黄河大桥十一号桥墩被冲毁。一千多铁路员工和建桥工程队伍已赶往抢修。
    京广铁路列车暂时改经陇海铁路转津浦铁路运行。
    黄河大桥是1904年建成的，很早就已超过了保险期，是解放后经加固继续使用的。
