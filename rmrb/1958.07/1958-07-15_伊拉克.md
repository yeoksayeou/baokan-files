Iraq is located in western Asia. In the southeast, it has a coastline leading to the Persian Gulf, where the famous Tigris and Euphrates rivers flow into the sea. Iraq covers an area of 436,156 square kilometers and has a population of approximately 6.53 million, the vast majority of whom are Arabs and followers of Islam.

In the early 17th century, Iraq was conquered by the Turkish Ottoman Empire and divided into the provinces of Baghdad and Basra. During World War I, British troops defeated the Turkish army and occupied Iraq. In 1920, the League of Nations turned Iraq into a British mandate. At that time, the Arab people held large-scale uprisings, fighting for national independence, but they were suppressed by the British colonialists. In 1921, Britain held a "referendum" in Baghdad, declaring Iraq independent and establishing Faisal as king. In 1930, Iraq signed a 25-year "Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance" with Britain. The treaty stipulated that British troops had the right to occupy Iraq's two largest air force bases, Habbaniyah and Seba, and station troops nearby, enjoying extraterritorial rights. The treaty also stipulated that Iraq's army would be organized by British officers, and in the event of war, Iraq would allow Britain to use its territory and various facilities. On January 15, 1948, Britain and Iraq signed a new Anglo-Iraqi 20-year "Treaty of Alliance." Britain attempted to use this new treaty to replace the 1930 treaty, but there was no essential difference between the two treaties; in fact, the new treaty further consolidated the chains of British enslavement of Iraq.

After World War II, American forces massively invaded the Middle East and tried hard to squeeze out British influence in Iraq. In 1951, the United States and Iraq signed a so-called "Technical Assistance Agreement" based on Truman's "Point Four Program." In 1953, under the instigation of the United States, Turkey and Iraq signed a 25-year "Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression." In April 1954, immediately after Turkey and Pakistan concluded a military agreement, the United States and Iraq secretly concluded a "Military Assistance Agreement." In February 1955, Iraq, under the direction of the United States, finally signed the Turkish-Iraqi pact in Baghdad with Turkey, which later developed into the Baghdad Pact. As a member of the Baghdad Pact, Iraq became a tool for imperialist countries to invade the Middle East.

For several years, the Iraqi government has been pursuing a reactionary policy of clinging to imperialism and dividing the unity of Arab countries. At the end of 1956, when Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt, the Iraqi Said government allowed the British Air Force to use Iraqi airfields to bomb Egypt. Last August, when the United States plotted a military invasion of Syria, the Iraqi government actively participated in the conspiracy. This February, when Egypt and Syria established the United Arab Republic, and the struggle of the Arab peoples against colonialism and for the defense of national independence was surging higher, Iraq and Jordan announced the formation of the "Arab Federation." This was planned single-handedly by the United States and other imperialists, who attempted to use the "Arab Federation" to antagonize the United Arab Republic, divide the unity of Arab countries, and further control Iraq and Jordan.

The Iraqi people have waged a long struggle for national independence and the unity of Arab countries. In recent years, the Iraqi people have resolutely opposed the government's participation in the Baghdad Pact and its implementation of policies that follow imperialism. After the establishment of the "Arab Federation," the Iraqi people launched strikes, class boycotts, and demonstrations to oppose the establishment of this federation that served imperialism and demanded the establishment of friendly cooperative relations with the United Arab Republic.

    伊拉克
    伊拉克在亚洲的西部。东南有海口通波斯湾，有名的底格里斯河和幼发拉底河从这里入海。伊拉克的面积有四十三万六千一百五十六平方公里，人口约六百五十三万多，绝大多数是阿拉伯人，信仰伊斯兰教。
    在十七世纪初，伊拉克曾被土耳其奥斯曼帝国征服，并被划为巴格达省和巴士拉省。第一次世界大战期间，英国军队打败了土耳其军队，占领了伊拉克。1920年，国际联盟把伊拉克变为英国的委任统治地。当时，阿拉伯人民举行了大规模起义，为争取民族独立而斗争，结果被英国殖民者镇压下去了。1921年，英国在巴格达举行了一次
  “公民投票”，宣布伊拉克独立，立费萨尔为国王。1930年，伊拉克与英国签订了为期二十五年的“英伊同盟条约”。条约规定英国军队有权占领伊拉克的哈巴尼雅和塞巴两个最大的空军基地，并在附近驻扎军队，享受治外法权。条约又规定伊拉克的军队由英国的军官组织，一旦发生战争，伊拉克应该把自己的领土和各种设备让给英国使用。1948年1月15日，英国和伊拉克签订了新的英伊二十年“同盟条约”。英国企图用这个新条约来代替1930年的条约，但这两个条约并无任何本质上的差别，事实是新条约更加巩固了英国奴役伊拉克的锁链。
    第二次世界大战后，美国势力大规模侵入中东，也极力要在伊拉克排挤英国势力。1951年，美国和伊拉克签订了根据杜鲁门“第四点计划”的所谓“技术援助协定”。1953年，在美国策动下，土耳其和伊拉克签订了一个为期二十五年的“友好与互不侵犯条约”。1954年4月，紧接着土耳其和巴基斯坦缔结军事协定后，美国和伊拉克秘密缔结了“军事援助协定”。1955年2月，伊拉克终于在美国指使下和土耳其在巴格达签订了土伊协定，后来发展为巴格达条约。作为巴格达条约的成员国的伊拉克，成了帝国主义国家侵略中东的工具。
    几年来伊拉克政府一直执行着依附帝国主义，分裂阿拉伯国家的团结的反动政策。1956年底，英、法、以侵略埃及时，伊拉克赛义德政府听任英国空军使用伊拉克机场轰炸埃及。去年8月，美国策划军事侵略叙利亚时，伊拉克政府积极地参与了这个阴谋。今年2月，当埃及和叙利亚成立了阿拉伯联合共和国，阿拉伯各国人民反对殖民主义和保卫民族独立斗争更加高涨的时候，伊拉克和约旦宣布结成“阿拉伯联邦”。这是美国和其他帝国主义所一手策划的，它们企图利用“阿拉伯联邦”来敌对阿拉伯联合共和国，分裂阿拉伯国家的团结，并进一步控制伊拉克和约旦。
    伊拉克人民为争取民族独立和阿拉伯国家的团结进行了长期的斗争。几年来，伊拉克人民坚决反对政府参加巴格达条约和执行追随帝国主义的政策。“阿拉伯联邦”成立后，伊拉克人民展开了罢工、罢课和示威游行的斗争，反对成立这个为帝国主义效劳的联邦，要求与阿拉伯联合共和国建立友好合作关系。　（胡真）
