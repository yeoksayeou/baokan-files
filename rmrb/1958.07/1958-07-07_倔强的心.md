    Stubborn Heart
    In a small village in the Ivanovo region of the Soviet Union, lived a higher education teacher named Nikolai Yevdokimov. Every morning, he sat at his desk and began his busy day of work. He carefully corrected the assignments sent in by correspondence students, guiding their studies. Looking at Nikolai in the photo, so serious and conscientious in his work, who would imagine that he was a disabled person, one who had achieved his lofty goals through persistent struggle!
    Even in his childhood, Nikolai dreamed of making the lights of his homeland as numerous and bright as the stars in the sky. With this ambition, Nikolai entered the Power Engineering Institute, but as he was about to graduate, the Great Patriotic War broke out. Nikolai resolutely went to the front lines, serving as a reconnaissance captain for the regiment. In a fierce battle, a bullet pierced Nikolai's head. Nikolai did not die, but lost his memory, could not speak, and could not move his legs and right hand.
    After years of treatment, Nikolai gradually regained his memory, was able to speak a little, and could move his right hand a bit, but his legs could not be saved. But even so, the ambition to "make the lights of his homeland as numerous and bright as the stars in the sky" burned again in Nikolai's heart. He entered the Industrial Correspondence Institute. Because his brain was injured, he had forgotten much of what he had learned in the past, and had to start all over again. Even more difficult was drawing; his right hand was already very inflexible, and after spending a lot of time drawing, he would often mess things up due to momentary numbness, rendering the drawing completely useless. However, Nikolai had a stubborn heart, he overcame all difficulties, completed all the courses, and was hired as a teacher at the All-Union Power Engineering Correspondence Institute because of his excellent academic performance.
    Nikolai's ambition was realized. Through the thousands of students he cultivated, he made the lights of his homeland as numerous and bright as the stars in the sky. (Fang) (Attached picture)

    倔强的心
    在苏联伊万诺沃州的一个小村子里，住着一位高等学校的教师，他的名字叫尼古拉·叶夫多基莫夫。每天清晨，他坐在桌前开始一天繁忙的工作。他细心地修改函授学生寄来的作业，指导他们的学习。你从照片上看到的严肃、认真工作的尼古拉，怎能想到他是一个残废的人，是一个经过顽强斗争终于达到自己崇高目的的人呢！
    还在童年时代，尼古拉就幻想使祖国大地上夜晚的灯火像天上的星星一样多、一样亮。尼古拉抱着这个志愿，考入了动力学院，但当他即将毕业的时候，伟大的卫国战争爆发了。尼古拉毅然走上了前线，担任团侦察队长。在一次激烈的战斗里，一粒子弹穿过了尼古拉的头部。尼古拉没有死，但是失去了记忆力，不会说话，两条腿和右手都不能转动了。
    经过多年的治疗，尼古拉逐渐恢复了记忆力，能讲些话了，右手也能活动一点了，可是两条腿却无法挽救。但是即使是这样，“使祖国大地上夜晚的灯火像天上的星星一样多、一样亮”的志愿，在尼古拉心中又燃烧起来。他进了工业函授学院。因为脑子受了伤，过去学的东西很多都已忘记，不得不一切从头学起。更困难的是画图，右手本来很不灵活，花费很多时间画了图，往往因为一时的麻木而出了乱子，使图全部作废。但是，尼古拉有一颗倔强的心，他克服了一切困难，读完了所有的课程，并且因为学习成绩非常优良而被聘请作全苏动力函授学院的教师。
    尼古拉的志愿实现了，他通过自己培养的千百名学生，使祖国大地上夜晚的灯火像天上的星星一样多、一样亮。　（方）（附图片）
