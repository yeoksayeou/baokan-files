    "Sunday Bridge"
    A flash flood washed away the only thoroughfare – a temporary bridge. The Tunnel Team Seven headquarters immediately convened a meeting to rush repairs on the temporary bridge. The next morning, the Party Branch Secretary led all the team's cadres to repair the bridge. After seven hours of intense labor, a long temporary bridge was completed. Because it was repaired on Sunday, people called it the "Sunday Bridge."

    “礼拜桥”
    山洪暴发把唯一的交通要道——一座便桥冲垮了。隧道七小队队部立刻召开了抢修便桥的会。第二天早晨，党支书便率领全体小队干部去修桥。经过七小时的紧张劳动，一座长长的便桥完工了。因为是礼拜天抢修的，人们管它叫“礼拜桥”。　筑路工人　江定久
