	Wooden Animal-Powered and Water-Powered Blower
	The Wuhan Black Metallurgy Design Institute recently successfully designed a wooden animal-powered or water-powered blower. This blower can be used on small blast furnaces of three to eight cubic meters, replacing mechanical blowing.

	This blower was designed by the design personnel of the Thermal Power Section of this design institute to solve the lack of blowers for small blast furnaces in the great development of the steel industry. It is simple in construction, mainly consisting of a large wooden gear with a diameter of 1,426 mm, two small gears with a diameter of 430 mm, and two wooden bellows. Except for the bearings which are made of iron, the rest are made of wood. During smelting and blowing, the large gear drives the two small gears, and each of the two small gears is equipped with a crank. The crank is equipped with a connecting rod, and the connecting rod drives the two bellows to blow air, which is stable and can meet the requirements of smelting. A three-cubic-meter blast furnace only requires one animal to pull it, and a five-cubic-meter blast furnace requires two animals to pull it. In areas with hydropower resources, hydropower can be used to drive it.

	A three-cubic-meter blast furnace using mechanical blowing costs at least 24,000 yuan, while using a wooden blower only costs 800 to 900 yuan, and can be manufactured by ordinary carpenters. In this way, agricultural cooperatives without electricity and blowing machinery can also build small blast furnaces. (Xinhua News Agency)

   木制畜力水力鼓风机
    武汉黑色冶金设计院最近设计成功一种木制畜力或水力鼓风机。这种鼓风机可以用在三到八立方公尺的小高炉上，代替机械鼓风。
    这种鼓风机，是这个设计院热力科的设计人员为解决钢铁工业大发展中，小高炉鼓风机缺乏而设计出来的。它构造简单，主要由一个直径为一千四百二十六公厘的大木齿轮和两个直径为四百三十公厘的小齿轮以及两个木风箱组成。除轴承部分为铁的外，其余都是木制材料。冶炼鼓风时，由大齿轮带动两个小齿轮，两个小齿轮上各安有一个曲柄。曲柄上安着连杆，连杆带动两个风箱鼓风，送风平稳，可以满足冶炼要求。三立方公尺的高炉只要一个牲口牵引，五立方公尺的高炉由两个牲口牵引。在有水力资源的地方可以采用水力带动。
    一个三立方公尺的高炉采用机械鼓风最少要二万四千元，而采用木制鼓风机成本只八、九百元，一般木工都可以制造。这样在没有电力和鼓风机械的农业合作社，也可以兴办小高炉。　（新华社）
