    Protest Rally on a Steamboat
    On the afternoon of the 19th, a steamboat departing from Hangzhou sailed along the canal towards Tangqi Town in the suburbs. The cabin was plastered with slogans protesting the American and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East, and the ship's staff constantly promoted the situation in the Middle East to the passengers.
    Yu Jian, an employee of the Hangzhou District Shipping Bureau, was reading the news in that day's "Hangzhou Daily" about the people in various places protesting the barbaric acts of American and British aggression. An old farmer in his sixties stepped forward to greet him: "Comrade, I heard that the American rascals are out biting people again! Is that right?"
    Yu Jian looked up and said to the old farmer, who was concerned about international affairs: "Yes! On July 15, the American bandits sent troops to invade Lebanon, and then Britain sent troops to invade Jordan. This barbaric act of American and British imperialism has aroused the anger of peace-loving people all over the world. Now Beijing, Shanghai... everywhere is holding rallies to protest, marching in demonstrations, and also writing letters and signing petitions to support the Arab people..." Yu Jian's voice grew louder.
    Suddenly, an old woman sitting next to Yu Jian showed an angry expression and interrupted Yu Jian: "The American bandits are bullying the common people again, no way! We won't allow these bastards to run rampant! Comrade, please sign my name as well, I am Liu Cuilan, a member of the Tangqi Agricultural Cooperative."
    The old farmer excitedly continued: "That's right, we can't let mad dogs bite people! Comrade, please write a letter of protest against the American and British bandits' aggression in the Middle East, and also write a letter to the people of Lebanon and Iraq, telling them: we will definitely support their just struggle and stand with them." He then turned to everyone and said: "I think everyone should sign their names, do you agree?"
    "Agree, agree!" the passengers shouted in unison.
    "It's a pipe dream for the Americans to oppress the people of the Middle East!" "The American wolves are heading for a dead end if they don't withdraw their troops!" The passengers' angry voices shook the cabin.
    Following the old farmer's suggestion, Yu Jian wrote the letter of protest and the letter of support, and many passengers eagerly signed their names on them.
    The steamboat arrived at Tangqi Town, but the people's angry mood still could not be contained for a long time. (Xinhua News Agency)

    轮船上的抗议集会
    19日下午，一艘从杭州开出的轮船，沿着运河驶向郊区塘栖镇。船舱内贴满了抗议美英帝国主义侵略中东的标语，船上员工不断向乘客们宣传中东局势。
    杭州区航运局职工于健，正在看当天“杭州日报”上各地人民抗议美英侵略暴行的消息。一位六十多岁的老农民上前向他打招呼：“同志，听说美国佬这疯狗又出来咬人啦！是吗？”
    于健抬起头，对这位关心国际大事的老农民说：“是呀！美国强盗在7月15日出兵侵略黎巴嫩，接着英国又出兵侵略约旦。美英帝国主义这种野蛮暴行已经激起了全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒，现在北京、上海……到处都在集会抗议，游行示威，还写信、签名声援阿拉伯人民……”于健的声音越说越响。
    忽然，坐在于健身边的一位老婆婆，显出愤怒的神色，打断了于健的话：“美国强盗又来欺侮老百姓，不行！我们不许这些王八蛋横行霸道！同志，请给我也签上一个名，我是塘栖农业社社员刘翠兰。”
    那位老农民激动地接着说：“对，不许疯狗咬人！同志，请你写张反对美国和英国强盗侵略中东的抗议书，再给黎巴嫩、伊拉克人民写封信，告诉他们：我们一定支持他们的正义斗争，和他们站在一边。”他接着面向大家说：“我看大家都来签个名，你们同意不同意？”
    “同意，同意！”乘客们异口同声地喊着。
    “美国佬要压迫中东人民真是梦想！”“美国狼再不退兵死路一条！”乘客们愤怒的声音震撼着船舱。
    于健按照老农民的提议，写好了抗议书和声援书，许多乘客争相在上面签了名字。
    轮船到塘栖镇了，人们愤怒的心情还久不能遏。　　（新华社）
