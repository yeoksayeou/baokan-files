A spokesman for the Central Flood Control Headquarters said that this year's Yellow River flood peak flow was similar to the extraordinary flood of 1933, which caused more than 50 breaches that year, and many provinces and regions suffered disasters; but this year, after the intense battle of the people on both sides, there was no flood diversion and no breaches, and the flood was finally tamed and entered the sea.

Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: The extraordinary Yellow River flood peak has been tamed and discharged into the Bohai Sea at 7:00 AM this morning after the brave fight of the people of Henan and Shandong provinces. Now, the water levels of all stations on the Yellow River have fallen below the warning level, and the tense ten-day battle has come to a complete victory. For this purpose, our reporter interviewed a spokesman for the Central Flood Control Headquarters. The spokesman said: The extraordinary Yellow River flood has been tamed and entered the sea, which is a major victory for the Yellow River flood control, and an unprecedented great victory.

The spokesman pointed out: This time, the extraordinary flood on the Yellow River not only came early, but also had a high flood peak, a rapid onset, and a long duration. Before this flood peak, the Yellow River Huayuankou Station had already experienced two flood peak flows of more than 7,000 cubic meters per second. After July 15th, continuous rainfall occurred in the Yellow River main stream and tributaries such as the Jing, Wei, and Beiluo Rivers, especially the torrential rain in the area from Shaan County to Qin Factory and the Yi and Luo Rivers. Huayuankou Station appeared at 23:30 on July 17th with the largest flood peak since liberation, with a flood peak flow of 21,000 cubic meters per second, which is similar to the great flood of 1933 (the largest flood on record). After a tense battle for a decade, without flood diversion and breaches, the flood was tamed and flowed into the Bohai Sea on July 27th.

The spokesman said: Before liberation, according to historical records, the Yellow River overflowed and breached its banks more than 1,500 times, and changed its course 26 times, including 9 major changes. This brought profound disasters to the people of downstream provinces. In 1933, the Yellow River caused more than 50 major breaches, and many provinces and regions suffered disasters. In 1934, the flood peak flow was only 8,500 cubic meters per second, which was much smaller than this year's flood, but it also breached four openings and flooded six counties. Since the people's governance of the Yellow River began in 1946, this situation has been reversed. The Yellow River has safely passed eleven flood seasons without any breaches or overflows. This year's extraordinary flood peak, with a total water volume of 6 billion cubic meters, is similar in water volume and flood peak flow to the largest flood year on record, 1933. In particular, before the people's governance of the Yellow River, floods in previous years would cause breaches before reaching Gaocun in Dongming County, so the river channel below Gaocun had never experienced such a large flood as this year. However, this year we overcame the extraordinary flood, without flood diversion and breaches on both sides, protecting the great bumper harvest of industry and agriculture. This is another miracle created by the Chinese people in the great leap forward of industry and agriculture.

The spokesman said: The ability to achieve such a great victory on the Yellow River is inseparable from the active governance of the Yellow River over the past ten years. Since the people's governance of the Yellow River began in 1946, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have attached great importance to the flood control work of the Yellow River. The 1,800-kilometer-long Yellow River levee has generally been raised by more than two meters. The original dilapidated straw and mud dams have also been rebuilt into stone dams and stone revetments. In recent years, more than 260,000 hidden dangers in the dikes have been discovered and filled using cone penetration tests. The masses along the river cherish the dikes as their lives, and there are often sound dike protection organizations carrying out tree planting and grass planting, as well as annual maintenance work. The hard work of millions of people over the years has significantly improved the flood resistance capacity of the dikes. This is one of the important conditions for overcoming the flood this year.

The spokesman said: This extraordinary flood peak of the Yellow River was subdued under the great leap forward situation of putting politics in command and the masses having soaring enthusiasm. Before the arrival of the extraordinary flood peak, under the leadership of the Party committees, all localities made full preparations in terms of labor, materials, flood control measures, and technical training, relying on the masses. The people on both sides of the river formed a strong and experienced flood control team. Once the flood situation entered a tense stage, under the personal command of Party and government leaders at all levels, more than one million flood control troops in Henan and Shandong provinces were投入to投入the flood control battle. After deeply analyzing the characteristics of the flood and the favorable conditions for flood control this year, the Party and the government timely made the decision to "fight hard for seven days and nights and hold the dikes without flood diversion." Flood control teams in various places held誓师meetings, expressing their determination to overcome the extraordinary flood and writing letters of determination and guarantee, putting forward豪迈slogans such as "Guarantee no breaches in the Yellow River and guarantee a great bumper harvest of industry and agriculture." In the struggle, cadres and the masses in various places supervised the water dikes day and night, inspected dangerous dikes, and rushed to protect dangerous works and build sub-embankments. After arduous battles, more than 2,000 dangerous situations in Shandong Province were finally turned into safety. The water level of the Dongping Lake dike exceeded the top of the dike, but it was also blocked by the hastily built sub-embankment.

The spokesman finally said: Since liberation, although the flood resistance capacity of the Yellow River dikes has been significantly improved, it is still difficult to guarantee the safety of the dikes when the flood flow at Huayuankou Station exceeds 20,000 cubic meters per second. According to the design standard, such a flood must take necessary flood diversion measures to reduce the flood peak in order to ensure safety. However, when the flood peak flow at Huayuankou Station reached 21,000 cubic meters per second this year, the leadership fully estimated the enthusiasm of the masses under the brilliant illumination of the general line, as well as the potential flood resistance capacity of the dikes, and made the decision to hold the dikes with all their strength without flood diversion. Facts have proved that this decision was correct. On the one hand, it avoided disasters, and on the other hand, it further boosted the fighting spirit of the masses and achieved victory. Although this flood has been tamed and entered the sea, the flood season of the Yellow River has not yet ended. On the basis of victory, all localities should further inspect the dikes and further prepare for flood control work to defend against possible larger floods.

    史无前例的一次伟大胜利
    中央防汛总指挥部发言人说，今年黄河洪峰流量与一九三三年特大洪水相似，那一年决口五十多处，很多省区受灾；但今年经过两岸人民紧张搏斗，没分洪，没决口，洪水终于驯服入海。
    新华社27日讯　黄河特大洪峰在河南和山东两省人民的奋战下，已在今晨七时驯服地泄入渤海。现在，黄河各站水位都已回落到警戒水位以下，紧张的十天战斗至此已获全胜。为此本社记者走访了中央防汛总指挥部发言人。发言人说：黄河特大洪水已驯服入海，这是黄河防汛的一次重大的胜利，是一次史无前例的伟大的胜利。
    发言人指出：这次黄河出现的特大洪水不仅来得早，而且洪峰高，来势猛，持续的时间长。这次洪峰前，黄河花园口站就曾出现过两个七千秒公方以上的洪峰流量。7月15日以后，黄河干流及泾、渭、北洛河等支流连续降雨，特别是陕县至秦厂区间及伊、洛河的猛降暴雨，花园口站于7月17日二十三时三十分又出现了解放以后的最大洪峰，洪峰流量达二万一千秒公方，与1933年大水（有记录以来最大洪水）相近似。经过一旬来的紧张搏斗，没分洪，没决口，洪水已于7月27日驯服地流入渤海。
    发言人说：黄河在解放前据历史记载泛滥决口达一千五百多次，改道有二十六次，其中大改道就有九次。给下游各省人民带来了深重灾难。1933年黄河就造成了大的决口五十多处，很多省区受灾。1934年洪峰流量仅有八千五百秒公方，比今年洪水小的多，但也决了四个口，淹了六个县。从1946年起人民治黄以来，这个局面已经扭转了，黄河已经安度了十一个伏秋大汛，没有发生决口泛滥。今年的特大洪峰，总水量达六十亿公方，这个水量和洪峰流量都和有水文记载以来的最大洪水年1933年相似。特别是人民治黄以前历年洪水到不了东明县高村就要发生决口，因而高村以下的河道是从没有经过像今年这样大的洪水的。但是今年我们战胜了特大洪水，两岸没分洪，没决口，保卫了工农业大丰收。这是我国人民在工农业大跃进中创造的又一个奇迹。
    发言人说：在黄河上能够取得这样伟大胜利，是和十多年来积极治理黄河分不开的。从1946年人民治黄以来，中国共产党和人民政府对黄河的防洪工作，给予极大的重视。一千八百公里长的黄河大堤，一般都加高了二公尺以上。原有破烂不堪的秸料坝垛，也都改建成石坝和石护坡。几年来利用锥探发现并挖填二十六万多处大堤隐患。沿河群众爱堤如命，经常有健全的护堤组织进行植树种草和岁修养护工作。千百万人民几年来的血汗劳动，大堤的抗洪能力有了显著的提高。这是今年战胜洪水重要条件之一。
    发言人说：这次黄河的特大洪峰，是屈服在有政治挂帅，群众干劲冲天的大跃进的形势之下的。特大洪峰到来前，各地就在党委领导下，在劳力、物料、防洪措施、技术传授各方面，依靠群众进行了充分的准备。两岸人民组成了强大的经验丰富的防汛队伍。汛情一入紧张阶段，在各级党、政领导亲自指挥下，河南、山东两省各有一百万以上的防汛大军投入防汛战斗。党和政府在深入分析洪水特性和今年防汛的有利条件之后，又及时地作出了“苦战七昼夜，坚守大堤不分洪”的决定。各地防汛队伍都召开了誓师大会，纷纷表示一定要战胜特大洪水，并写了决心书、保证书，提出了“保证黄河不决口，保证工农业大丰收”等豪迈口号。在斗争中，各地干部和群众夜以继日地监视水堤、检查险堤，抢护险工和抢筑子埝。经过坚苦的战斗，山东省境发出的二千多次险象，终于化险为夷。东平湖堤，水位超过堤顶，也靠赶筑的子埝挡住了。
    发言人最后说：解放以来，黄河堤防抗洪能力虽有显著提高，但保证花园口站二万以上秒公方洪水时的堤防安全仍是困难的，按设计标准这样的洪水必须采取必要的分洪措施削减洪峰，才能保证安全。但当今年花园口站出现二万一千秒公方洪峰流量时，领导上充分估计了群众在总路线的光辉照耀下的干劲，以及堤防抗洪的潜在能力，作出了全力坚守大堤不分洪的决定。事实证明这个决定是正确的。一方面避免了灾害，另一方面更鼓舞了群众的战斗情绪，取得了胜利。这次洪水虽已驯服入海，但黄河汛期还没有结束，在胜利的基础上，各地应进一步检查堤防，并进一步作防汛准备工作，以防御可能到来的更大洪水。
