After Implementing the Investment Contract System

By Our Correspondent Zhao Shenying

The method of entrusting construction units with the comprehensive contracting of industrial capital construction investment at each level is a major reform in the basic construction industry and an important guarantee for implementing the general line of socialist construction by relying on the strength of the masses. This has already been proven by the facts at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant.

        Old Systems and Institutions Were Unreasonable

The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry originally formulated the expansion plan for the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant as follows: an investment of 240 million yuan to expand the plant into a medium-sized iron and steel plant with an annual output of 1.4 million tons of pig iron and 500,000 tons of steel by 1961.

In order to familiarize themselves with expansion work, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant sent a group led by the factory director to fraternal plants in the south last year to learn basic construction experience. The factory director returned from his studies both happy and worried. He was happy to have learned a lot of construction experience; he was worried that the fraternal plants universally talked about the "Two-Table Settlement System" and the "One Task, Three Masters" system of basic construction, which caused frequent squabbles and tense relations between the construction, design, and construction departments. Sometimes, delays in the construction period and losses were caused by these squabbles. The "Two-Table Settlement System" divided the construction work into three parties: A, B, and C, based on the contracting process of general and secondary contracting. Party A reported to Party B, and Party B reported to Party C, all based on engineering schedules and acceptance of the work. This method of only following the schedules often deviated from the actual situation, leading to numerous disputes. The "One Task, Three Masters" system assigned construction tasks to the construction, design, and construction departments, resulting in multiple heads and no unified leadership.

After the leaders of this plant returned from their studies, various departments were already embroiled in disputes. There were many objective factors from the outside, but there were also subjective factors within the factory itself, because the factory always hoped that the higher authorities would invest more and make the enterprise larger and to higher standards.

  Breaking with Conventions, Delegating Power

During the "Double-Anti" movement, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry broke with outdated rules and regulations, abolished the "Two-Table Settlement System," and decided to implement a pilot investment contract system at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, entrusting the plant with the comprehensive use of 240 million yuan and tasking it with full responsibility from design to construction.

This decision greatly invigorated the plant, and the leadership's thinking was immediately liberated from its past confines. Based on the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's requirement of "one investment, two outputs," the factory's Party committee decided to increase steel output without increasing investment. After research, they revised the preliminary design, lowered excessively high standards, eliminated unnecessary equipment, and simplified ancillary facilities, saving 40 million yuan from the original investment. This money was used to expand and add some iron and steelmaking equipment, transforming the original plan to build a medium-sized iron and steel plant by 1961 into a large-scale iron and steel complex, with steel production reaching 1.3 million tons and iron production reaching 1.9 million tons by 1961. This achieved "no increase in investment, steel production more than doubled." At the same time, the investment per ton of steel was reduced from the original plan of 460 yuan to more than 180 yuan. Before the implementation of the investment contract system, the Black Metallurgy Design Institute, which was responsible for the design of the plant's major projects, also intended to tap the potential of the equipment and double the steel output within the original investment range in response to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's call to "turn one plant into two plants" during the "Double-Anti" movement. At this time, the news of the investment contract system further encouraged the designers. In order to submit the drawings ahead of schedule, they worked day and night on the design.

The broad masses of workers at this plant were also delighted to hear the news of the investment contract system. Within two weeks, the factory's employees submitted more than 1,600 rationalization proposals to save money and produce more steel. In addition to proactively proposing to reduce the cost of temporary projects, the construction department's employees also put forward many suggestions to reduce project costs and accelerate construction speed. All the employees in the construction department voluntarily increased the construction tasks assigned to them by the state this year by nearly 100%. The production and transportation departments' employees greatly demonstrated their initiative; other workshops also dispatched a large number of workers for the expansion project, and the factory's employees launched a vigorous campaign of voluntary labor for the expansion project.

  Making Construction, Design, and Construction into One Force

The method of investment contracting and the change in the basic construction system not only liberated the thinking of the plant's leadership and stimulated the enthusiasm of the workers, but also, under the unified leadership of the factory, made the forces of construction, design, and construction into one force, eliminating the past phenomenon of arguing and wrangling. Before the implementation of the investment contract system, the Black Metallurgy Design Institute firmly advocated cutting the hot-blast stove equipment for the electric welding pipe workshop, which was valued at 70,000 yuan, in order to save money, because the absence of this equipment would not affect production. However, the factory disagreed with the reduction, and the two sides argued endlessly without a conclusion. Before the implementation of the investment contract system, there was also a tendency to seek novelty and largeness in thinking and to neglect savings. There were endless disputes with the design institute over the issue of reducing equipment in the machine repair shop. After the implementation of the investment contract system, the factory took the initiative to propose reducing the investment in this equipment, saving 480,000 yuan.

Since the entire construction and design work was fully responsible by the factory, many outdated rules and regulations were also broken, greatly accelerating the progress of the project. In the past, civil engineering units could not do installation work. Now, because the metal structure company responsible for the installation project of the machine repair shop's foundry workshop had not yet arrived with their construction force, the civil engineering unit accepted the entire installation task. If the previous "Two-Table Settlement System" and "One Task, Three Masters" method had been followed, the expansion project of this plant would not have started until the end of this year or the beginning of next year, but now it officially started at the end of May.

In order to facilitate the implementation of the contract system and unified leadership, the plant changed the organizational structure and management system of basic construction. In terms of construction, they adopted the principle of combining comprehensive and specialized approaches, breaking the previously overly cumbersome and rigid division of labor. They established several engineering divisions according to the two professional natures of civil construction and installation. In addition to being fully responsible for the civil construction projects in one construction zone, the civil construction engineering division was also responsible for managing and directing the installation projects in that construction zone. The installation engineering division was only responsible for installation projects, but all installation projects such as metal structures, machines, and pipelines were integrated into one engineering division. Civil engineering and installation engineering divisions cooperated with each other, and installation forces could be transferred to the civil engineering division for work at any time as needed. In administrative work, there used to be numerous departments and numerous functional personnel. Now, the contract system of general and secondary contracting has been abolished, the departments have been merged, and the departments of parties A, B, and C have been combined into one, with each department being responsible for both civil construction and installation in a unified manner. Moreover, the planning department not only manages annual and quarterly plans, but also manages long-term plans and work plans. In addition to supplying materials, the materials department also supplies all structural parts. The result of doing so is that it greatly streamlined the organization and non-production personnel. According to the previous "Two-Table Settlement System" and cumbersome division of labor methods, it was necessary to establish 26 departments and more than 700 functional personnel. Now, only 10 departments and 350 functional personnel are needed.

      Comprehensive Contract System, Layer-by-Layer Contract System

On the basis of implementing the comprehensive investment contract system, this plant is promoting a comprehensive contract system and a layer-by-layer contract system. The comprehensive contract system means "four packages": package investment, package output, package progress, and package quality. The layer-by-layer contract system means four-level contracting from the plant to the engineering division, work section, and mixed team. When contracting is done to the grassroots team, the workers' power and responsibility increase, and at the same time, workers must also implement mixed-trade production. Therefore, this plant specifically adopted a "four-in-one" method in grassroots contracting. The so-called "four-in-one" is to comprehensively utilize the methods of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's construction workers learning multiple skills, Anshan No. 2 Mine Engineering Company's pricing based on quality, Heilongjiang Qinghua Tool Factory's workers participating in production management, and Shenyang Nonferrous Metals Bureau's single-item project contracting, forming a complete grassroots contract system. This closely integrates investment contracting with the production activities of the workers, further enhancing the sense of responsibility of the broad masses of workers.

Grassroots contracting has many advantages: First, the phenomenon of work stoppages and idleness caused by mutual wrangling between processes has been fundamentally eliminated. Second, labor efficiency has increased, and the construction period has been shortened. Two teams have overfulfilled their contract tasks by 40% and more than 100%, respectively. Third, the quality has reached 100%. Fourth, the phenomenon of workers managing and arranging production themselves and falsely reporting has been eliminated. Fifth, on average, everyone has learned one more skill in more than ten days, and some have learned two or three more skills. In learning, veteran workers teach young workers, and young workers respect veteran workers. Whoever knows is the teacher, and the teacher can also be the apprentice. A spirit of unity and learning has formed in the team. The workers reflected, "We have a clear understanding of production, and work is also going smoothly." "It can not only be completed ahead of schedule, but also learn multiple skills, which is in line with both national and individual interests."

    实行投资包干以后
    本报记者　赵慎应
    工业基建投资交给建设单位逐层包干使用的办法，是基本建设事业上的大改革，是依靠群众力量贯彻社会主义建设总路线的一个重要保证。这已为石景山钢铁厂的事实所证明。
        旧的制度、体制不合理
    冶金工业部原来制订石景山钢铁厂的扩建计划是：投资两亿四千万元，到1961年把这个厂扩建成为年产一百四十万吨生铁和五十万吨钢的中型钢铁厂。
    石景山钢铁厂为了熟悉扩建业务，去年由厂长带了一个小组到南方各兄弟厂学习基本建设经验。厂长学习回来，心中又喜又忧。喜的是学到了很多建设经验；忧的是各兄弟厂普遍谈到“二号表结算制度”和基本建设“一事三主”的体制，使建设、设计、施工部门之间，经常互相扯皮，关系紧张；有时还因扯皮拖延了工期，造成损失。“二号表结算制”是把建设、施工方面按大包、二包的包工程序，分成甲、乙、丙三方，甲方对乙方、乙方对丙方都根据工程表报，验收工程。这种只按表报制度办事的方法，往往和实际情况脱节，以致造成大量扯皮现象。“一事三主”的体制是把建设任务分别由建设、设计、施工三个部门的多头负责，没有统一领导。
    这个厂的领导人学习回来后，各部门正陷入了扯皮的漩涡里。扯皮有许多外来的客观因素，但也有工厂本身的主观因素，因为厂方总是希望上级多投资，把企业搞大些，标准高一些。
  打破陈规，实行权力下放
    双反运动中，冶金工业部打破陈旧规章，废除“二号表结算制度”，决定在石景山钢铁厂试行投资包干的办法，把两亿四千万元交给这个厂包干使用，由这个厂担负起从设计到施工的全部责任。
    这个决定给这个厂带来了极大的振奋，领导上的思想从过去的圈子里一下解放出来。工厂党委会根据冶金部投资一顶两的要求，决定在投资不增的情况下多出钢，经过研究，修改初步设计，降低过高标准，取消不必要的设备，简化附属性的设施等，从原投资中节省出四千万元，把这笔钱用来扩大和增添一些炼铁炼钢设备，使原计划在1961年建成的中型钢铁厂一跃而成为一个大型钢铁联合企业，到1961年钢产量达到一百三十万吨，铁产量达到一百九十万吨。做到“投资不增，钢加倍半”。同时，使每吨钢的投资由原计划的四百六十元降低到了一百八十多元。在实行投资包干前，负责这个厂主要工程设计工作的黑色冶金设计院，在双反运动中响应冶金部“一个厂变两个厂”的号召，也曾打算在原投资的范围内，挖掘设备潜力，把钢产量增加一倍。这时，投资包干的消息更加鼓舞了设计人员。为了提前交出图纸，他们日夜进行设计工作。
    这个厂的广大职工群众听到投资包干的消息后，也都欢欣鼓舞。全厂职工在两周内提出了一千六百多件少花钱多出钢的合理化建议。施工部门职工除了主动提出了降低临时工程造价，还提出了许多降低工程成本和加快建设速度的建议。施工部门全体职工自动把今年国家交给他们的施工任务，增加了将近一倍。生产部门、运输部门职工大大发挥了积极性；其他车间也为扩建工程出动了大批劳动力，全厂职工掀起了为扩建工程义务劳动的热潮。
  使建设、设计、施工拧成一股劲
    投资包干和基本建设体制改变的办法不仅解放了这个厂领导上的思想和激发了职工群众的热情，而且在工厂的统一领导下，使建设、设计、施工等三方面的力量拧成了一股劲，消除了过去争吵扯皮现象。在实行投资包干前，黑色冶金设计院为了节约，坚决主张削去价值七万元的电焊管车间的热风机设备，因为没有这些设备，并不影响生产，厂方却不同意削减，双方争论不休，没有定论。在实行投资包干前，在思想上也有求新求大、忽视节约的情形，在削减机修厂的设备问题上和设计院争论不休。实行投资包干的办法后，厂里主动提出削减此项设备投资，节省了四十八万元。
    由于整个施工、设计工作由工厂全面负责，也打破了过去许多清规戒律，使工程进度大大加快。过去土建单位不能做安装活，现因负责机修厂铸造车间安装工程的金属结构公司施工力量没有来到，土建单位就接受了全部安装的任务。如果按照过去“二号表结算制度”和“一事三主”的办法，这个厂的扩建工程要到今年底或明年初才能施工，但是现在在5月底就正式开工了。
    为了便于实行包干和统一领导，这个厂改变了基本建设的组织机构和管理体制。在施工方面，他们采取了综合与专业相结合的原则，打破了以前分工过于繁琐呆板的形式。他们按照土木建设和安装的两类专业性质分设了几个工程处，土建工程处除全部负责一个工区的土木建设工程外，还负责管理指挥该工区的安装工程。安装工程处只负责安装工程，但是把金属机构、机器、管道等安装工程全部统入一个工程处里。土建与安装工程处互相协作，安装力量可以根据需要随时调入土建工程处工作。在行政工作上，过去是科室林立，职能人员众多，现在大包、二包的合同制度取消了，科室大合并，甲、乙、丙三方的科室合而为一，每个科室又都对土建和安装统一负责。而且计划科不仅要管年度计划季度计划，还要管远景计划和作业计划，材料科除供应材料外，还要供应全部结构零件。这样做的结果，也就大大精简了机构和非生产人员。按照过去的“二号表结算制度”和繁琐的分工方法，需要设立二十六个科室，七百多个职能人员，现在只要十个科室和三百五十个职能人员就够了。
      全面包干层层包干
    在实行投资大包干办法的基础上，这个厂正在推行着全面包干层层包干的办法。全面包干，就是包投资、包产量、包进度、包质量的四包，层层包干，就是从厂到工程处、工段、混合小组的四级包干。包到基层小组，工人的权力和责任就加大了，同时工人也必须实行混合工种的生产。所以这个厂在基层包干方面，具体采用了一种“四合一”的方法，所谓“四合一”就是把太原钢铁厂建筑工人的学习多技能、鞍山二矿工程公司的以质论价、黑龙江庆华工具厂工人参加生产管理、沈阳有色金属局的单项工程包工等方法加以综合利用，形成了一个完整的基层包干制。这样就使投资包干同工人群众的生产活动紧密结合起来，更加提高了广大职工群众的责任感。
    基层包干有很大好处：一、工序与工序之间因互相扯皮造成停工窝工的现象已经根本消除。二、劳动效率提高，工期缩短了，两个小组分别超额40％和100％多完成了包干任务。三、质量都达到百分之百。四、工人自己管理和安排生产，虚报多报的现象消灭了。五、十多天里，平均每人都多学会了一种技能，有的多学会了两种到三种，在学习中，老工人教青年工人，青年工人敬爱老工人，谁会谁就是师傅，师傅也能当徒弟，组里形成了一种团结学习的风气。工人们反映说“我们对生产心中有数了，工作也顺当了。”“既能提前完工，又能学习多种技能，既符合国家利益，又符合个人利益。”
