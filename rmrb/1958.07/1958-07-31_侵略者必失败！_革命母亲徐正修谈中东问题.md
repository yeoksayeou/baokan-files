    Invaders are Bound to Fail!
    ——Revolutionary Mother Xu Zhengxiu on the Middle East Question
    By Our Correspondent Fang Di
    Two days ago, I made a special trip to the old revolutionary base area of Hong'an County to visit the famous socialist revolutionary fighter Xu Zhengxiu and asked her about her views on the Middle East issue. This seventy-three-year-old but still very strong woman said many times during the conversation: "Invaders are bound to fail!" Her tone was so firm, and the various reasons she gave were completely convincing.
    In Hong'an County and even the entire Hubei Province, Xu Zhengxiu is a very famous person. People habitually and affectionately call her "Revolutionary Mother," "Heroic Mother," and "Strong Socialist Revolutionary Fighter." As early as the Land Revolution period, Xu Zhengxiu began to devote herself to the revolutionary tide. After the failure of the Land Revolution, the enemy slaughtered her husband, sons, and brothers. She herself was repeatedly subjected to the enemy's severe torture and imprisonment, and was forced to wander outside for many years. However, all this did not shake her revolutionary will, but made her will more firm and her struggle more active. From then on, whether during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries or during the occupation of Japanese imperialism, she fought bravely for the revolutionary cause with unwavering loyalty, day after day for decades. After liberation, she actively led the masses to carry out various rural social reforms and develop agricultural production, and was repeatedly elected as a special or first-class agricultural labor model, rural work model, and revolutionary martyr family model in Hong'an County and Hubei Province. She also attended the National Conference of Active Elements in Socialist Construction of Revolutionary Martyrs and Military Dependents and the Third National Women's Congress.
    Xu Zhengxiu recalled her decades of revolutionary experience and said: "Our life today is too happy. I am already seventy-three years old, but life makes me feel very young. However, in order to obtain this peaceful and happy life, how hard did the Chinese people struggle and how much did they pay under the leadership of the Party! My family, including my husband, my two brothers, and two sons, all gloriously sacrificed for the revolution. Can we allow imperialism to destroy this hard-won happy life? Absolutely not! And the US and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East is a serious threat to world peace. Therefore, we must not stand idly by."
    Speaking of this, the revolutionary mother paused for a moment, as if thinking about something. Then, she said firmly: "The Middle East issue will inevitably end with the failure of the invaders. The people of our country oppose aggression and love peace, and the people of the world also oppose aggression and love peace. The ranks of the invaders are too small. This is the most important factor for the inevitable failure of the invaders. Isn't that what the facts show? When we were making revolution, the imperialists actively supported the Kuomintang reactionaries, trying to maintain their rule in our country, but as a result, they failed. US imperialism and its partners launched the war of aggression against Korea, trying to further enslave the people of the East through the invasion of Korea, but as a result, under the heavy blows of the Chinese and Korean people and the support of the world's peace-loving people, they failed again. Then this time, when the forces of peace are already unprecedentedly strong, how can they avoid failure? The people of Hong'an County see this very clearly. Back then, the people of Hong'an and the people of many old revolutionary base areas, with spears, kitchen knives, and a small number of rifles, persisted in the revolutionary struggle and finally defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries directly armed by US imperialism, and the once fierce Japanese imperialism. So in our country today, which is already unprecedentedly strong, what is there to be afraid of imperialism?"
    When Xu Zhengxiu talked about her own concrete actions to oppose the aggressors and support the people of the Middle East, she said: "Like all peace-loving Chinese peasants, my current action is to further improve agricultural production and produce more grain and other agricultural crops, so as to further support industrial construction and strengthen our country's national defense. I will do my best to mobilize more people to do the same." In fact, she is doing just that. Under her leadership and influence, the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative of Wansheng Township, Hong'an County, which she participated in leading, has put forward the slogan of using increased production to fight back against the aggressors and support the people of the Middle East, and is doing its best to turn the slogan into reality. After several days of repeated discussions, the Xinghuo Cooperative has revised its leap forward plan: according to the original plan, the average per-mu yield of rice and peanuts in this cooperative was 1,300 jin, while the revised plan is 2,000 jin per mu for rice and 1,500 jin per mu for peanuts. Xu Zhengxiu herself, along with several cooperative members, has also been conducting high-yield experiments with a target of 10,000 jin per mu for rice and 10,000 jin per mu for peanuts. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer, she led the women of the entire cooperative to dismantle more than a dozen old houses in two days, obtaining more than 7,000 dan of old brick soil that can be used as fertilizer.
    When I bid farewell to this heroic woman, she once again said to me excitedly: "I am a person who has suffered deeply from the persecution of the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by imperialism. Now, US imperialism not only continues to support the Kuomintang reactionaries, but also occupies our territory of Taiwan and refuses to let go. Now it and its partner British imperialism are launching armed aggression in the Middle East, which is really hateful. This is old hatred plus new hatred, and I will never forgive them. As long as I am alive, I will fight the aggressors to the end and never stand idly by! I am sure that victory will surely belong to the peace-loving people, and the aggressors will surely fail!"

    侵略者必失败！
    ——革命母亲徐正修谈中东问题
    本报记者　方堤
    两天前，我专程到老革命根据地红安县去访问了著名的社会主义革命战士徐正修，请她谈谈对中东问题的看法。这位已经七十三岁但还很健壮的老人，在谈话中多次地说：“侵略者是必然要失败的！”她的语气是那样坚定，而她所举出的各种理由又完全令人信服。
    在红安县甚至整个湖北省来说，徐正修是一个非常有名的人物。人们习惯地、亲切地称她是“革命母亲”、“英雄的妈妈”、“坚强的社会主义革命战士”。早在土地革命时期，徐正修就开始投身到革命的浪潮中去了。土地革命失败后，敌人屠杀了她的丈夫、儿子和兄弟，她本人也多次地遭到敌人的严刑拷打和监禁，并曾被迫在外流落多年。但是，所有这些，都没有动摇她的革命意志，而是使她意志更加坚定，斗争更加积极了。从那以后，无论是国民党反动派统治时期，也无论是日本帝国主义占领时期，她都坚贞不屈地为革命事业英勇地斗争着，数十年来如一日。解放后，她又积极地带动群众进行各项农村社会改革和发展农业生产，曾多次地当选为红安县、湖北省的特等或甲等农业劳动模范、农村工作模范、革命烈属模范，并曾先后出席过全国革命烈、军属社会主义建设积极分子大会和第三次全国妇女代表大会。
    徐正修回忆几十年的革命经历时说：“今天我们的生活是太幸福了。我已经七十三岁，生活却使我觉得自己还很年轻。但是，为了获得现在这种和平幸福的生活，我们中国人民在党的领导下进行多么艰苦的斗争和付出过多么巨大的代价啊！我一家人，包括我丈夫和我的两个兄弟、两个儿子，就都是为革命而光荣牺牲的。这样得来的幸福生活，难道我们能让帝国主义来破坏它吗？决不能！而美、英帝国主义侵略中东，正是对整个世界和平的严重威胁。所以，我们决不能袖手旁观。”
    说到这里，这位革命母亲停顿了一下，好像在思索什么。然后，她坚定地说：“中东问题，必然以侵略者的失败而告终。我们国家的人民是反对侵略热爱和平的，全世界人民也是反对侵略和热爱和平的，侵略者的队伍是太渺小了。这就是侵略者必然失败的最重要的因素。难道事实不正是这样的吗？我们革命的时候，帝国主义者积极支持国民党反动派，想在我国维持他们的统治，但结果他们失败了。美帝国主义和它的伙伴们发动了侵朝战争，想通过侵略朝鲜进一步奴役东方人民，但结果，在中、朝人民的沉重打击和世界爱好和平人民的声援下，他们又一次地失败了。那末这一次，当和平力量已经空前强大的时候，他们又怎么能够避免失败呢？关于这点，我们红安县的人民是看得很清楚的。想当年，我们红安人民和许多老革命根据地人民一道，用长矛、菜刀和少量的步枪坚持革命斗争，还能终于打垮由美帝国主义直接武装的国民党反动派，和曾经凶顽一时的日本帝国主义。那么在我国已经空前强大的今天，帝国主义又有什么可怕的呢？”
    徐正修在谈到她自己的反对侵略者和支持中东人民的具体行动时说：“和所有爱好和平的中国农民一样，当前，我的行动是进一步搞好农业生产，多产粮食和其他农业作物，以此来进一步支援工业建设，加强我国的国防力量。我将尽我的力量，来发动更多的群众一齐来这样作。”而事实上，她的确也正是在这样作。在她的带动和影响下，有她参加领导的红安县万胜乡星火农业社，已经提出了用多增产的行动来反击侵略者和支援中东人民的口号，并且正全力把口号变成现实。经过几天的反复讨论，星火社已经修订了跃进规划：按原订规划，这个社的水稻、花生平均亩产都是一千三百斤，而修订后的规划是水稻亩产二千斤，花生亩产一千五百斤。徐正修自己还和几个社员一起，作了水稻亩产万斤、花生亩产万斤的高产试验。为了解决肥料不足的困难，她带动全社妇女在两天内拆了十多间旧房屋，共得可作肥料的陈砖土七千多担。
    当我告别这位英雄妇女的时候，她再次激动地对我说：“我是遭受由帝国主义支持的国民党反动派迫害很深的人。如今，美帝国主义不仅还在继续支持国民党反动派，并且还占领着我国领土台湾不放。现在它又和它的伙伴英帝国主义一起武装侵略中东，实在太可恶了。这是旧恨加新仇，我无论如何也不会饶恕它们。只要我还活着，我就要和侵略者斗争到底，决不袖手旁观！我确信，胜利是一定属于爱好和平的人民的，侵略者必将失败！”
