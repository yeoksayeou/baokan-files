    Graphite Made from Slag

    We have successfully trial-produced graphite refined from blast furnace iron slag, a topic that capitalist countries have not yet successfully researched. This was achieved through the joint efforts of our young teachers, laboratory technicians, and students. The refined graphite has a carbon content of 99.46% (compared to 95% in the United States), reaching international standards.

    During the graphite research process, young lecturer Wang Zune discovered that blast furnace slag contains graphite. Everyone was very excited when they heard this news, because graphite, which is widely needed in emerging industries such as electron tube manufacturing and atomic reactors, used to be imported. It is estimated that every ton of pig iron produced by the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant contains 0.02 to 0.03 tons of graphite, and graphite can be produced wherever there is pig iron in the country. The economic value of this discovery is considerable.

    In this experiment, we experienced many failures. Finally, we creatively developed a method for refining graphite from slag, increasing the carbon content of graphite to 99.46%, which can meet the requirements of many industrial specifications. At the same time, we creatively used by-products of coking as frothers and collectors for flotation, greatly reducing the cost of the product to only one-twentieth of the imported product.

    用炉渣制成的石墨

    用高炉铁水浮渣精选石墨，这项资本主义国家尚未研究成功的课题，在我们青年教师、实验员和学生共同努力下，终于试制成功了。精选出的石墨含碳量达99.46％（美国为95％），赶上了国际水平。
    在研究石墨过程中，青年讲师王祖讷发现高炉的铁渣中含有石墨。大家听到这个消息十分兴奋。因为在电子管制造、原子反应堆等新兴工业中广泛需用的石墨，以前一向依靠进口。据估计，石景山钢铁厂每一吨生铁就有零点零二—零点零三吨的石墨，而全国有生铁的地方就可以生产石墨。这个发现的经济价值是相当大的。
    我们在这次试验中，经过了多次的失败，最后，终于创造了用炉渣精选石墨的办法，使石墨的含碳量达到了99.46％，可以满足许多工业规格的要求。同时，我们创造性地用炼焦副产品作浮选的起泡剂和捕集剂，使产品成本大大降低，只为进口的二十分之一。
