The recent new aggression of the U.S. and British imperialism against the people of the Middle East has provided a vivid lesson for all nations striving for freedom and independence. Who is a friend and who is an enemy is now exceptionally clear.

When patriotic soldiers in Iraq, with the support of the people, overthrew the Faisal dynasty and established the Republic of Iraq, the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union all warmly celebrated the victory of the Iraqi people's struggle against imperialism. However, the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, for the U.S. imperialism, which was using the Baghdad Pact to enslave the Middle East, maintain its colonial rule there, and eagerly attempting to invade the Middle East under the cover of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," was like a bolt from the blue. It immediately, along with Britain, disregarding the risk of provoking a world war, shed all pretense of benevolence, successively sending troops to land in Lebanon and Jordan, vainly attempting to use force to extinguish the surging Arab national independence and liberation movement.

The U.S. and British acts of aggression threatened Iraq and the United Arab Republic, disrupted peace in the Middle East, and put the world on the brink of a new war. The Soviet Union and China successively issued strong statements, warning against the U.S. and British crimes of aggression, demanding that the U.S. and Britain withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan, supporting the struggle of the Arab people, and expressing their determination not to stand idly by. In the twelve socialist countries, from Beijing to Moscow, from Pyongyang to Berlin, the broad masses of people universally held anti-aggression demonstrations, extending hands of assistance to the people of the Middle East.

When the U.S. and Britain occupied Lebanon and Jordan, attempting to further invade the Republic of Iraq, and the situation in the Middle East became extremely tense, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev held talks with Nasser, discussing measures to stop aggression against the Arab world and safeguard the independence of Arab countries. The Soviet Union and Bulgaria held military exercises along the North Caucasus and the Black Sea, and promptly warned Turkey, which was attempting to invade Iraq. The Soviet Union also declared that it would do everything possible to consolidate the Republic of Iraq, and that it was willing to do everything possible to help the colonial peoples gain liberation and national independence.

The resolute struggle of the Arab people against aggression, the strong support of the powerful socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, and the torrent of people all over the world who love peace and oppose U.S. and British aggression and defend world peace, curbed the U.S. and British imperialists' plan to expand their aggression, forcing them to accept the Soviet proposal to sit down and negotiate.

The above facts once again prove that the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is a powerful pillar of world peace. The socialist countries led by the Soviet Union are the most reliable friends of the Arab nations and all oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America striving for liberation.

The socialist countries' profound sympathy and unreserved support for the struggle of the people of the Middle East, and for all oppressed nations and countries subjected to aggression, against colonialism and for the maintenance of national independence, did not begin just now. From the years when there was only one socialist country, the Soviet Union, to today, when twelve countries have formed a powerful socialist camp, the socialist countries have consistently adopted this clear proletarian internationalist stance. Speaking of the distant past, after the Russian October Revolution overthrew the Tsar and the bourgeois provisional government and seized power, it immediately declared for the first time in human history the abolition of all unequal treaties of the Tsarist era with China and other countries, and the abolition of all enslavement systems of the Tsarist regime towards colonies and semi-colonies. Speaking of the recent past, who has been constantly exposing and criticizing imperialist aggression and interference at the United Nations and other international conferences, resolutely defending the interests of all oppressed and invaded nations? Who resolutely supported the struggle of the Indian people to recover Goa, the struggle of the Indonesian people to recover West Irian, and when Indonesia faced the grave danger of foreign interference, sternly warned the imperialists? Who unreservedly supported the struggle of the people of North Africa and Algeria against colonial rule, and supported many newly independent countries in Asia and Africa? And who, in 1956, 1957, and now, when the clouds of aggressive war had already enveloped Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, gave the greatest support to the Arab people, preventing the bloody hands of the aggressors? Everyone knows that it is the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union. In order to help all emancipated oppressed countries develop their economies, the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union helps many Asian and African countries develop their own independent economies without attaching any political conditions. These are all facts that no rumor, slander, or instigation can change.

Imperialists often slander socialist countries' sympathy and active support for national liberation movements as "expansion," "indirect aggression," and "infiltration." As imperialists, they truly cannot understand why socialist countries can so consistently assist all oppressed and invaded nations without harboring any selfish motives. For some countries and peoples who have suffered long years of oppression and aggression, due to historical experience, they often cannot fully understand the active assistance of socialist countries for a time. This is not surprising.

The proletariat and its vanguard, the Communist Party, are internationalists. Its lofty goal of struggle is to pursue a social system without exploitation of man by man. Therefore, it must resolutely oppose one nation oppressing another. Just as Marx taught people: "A nation that oppresses other nations cannot be free." Therefore, all socialist countries and communist parties resolutely oppose imperialist aggression, fight for national independence and liberation, and deeply sympathize with and actively support all oppressed nations and invaded countries in their struggle against colonialism and for the maintenance of national independence. Socialist countries regard their support for all anti-colonialist struggles as their own undeniable duty.

The October Revolution opened up vast possibilities and realistic paths for the liberation cause of the working class and oppressed nations throughout the world. The victory of the October Socialist Revolution and the policy of equality and friendship towards all oppressed nations implemented by the Soviet Union for the first time shook the imperialist colonial system and awakened the oppressed nations. China, which had long suffered from imperialist oppression and aggression, its victory in the people's revolution, and its rapid progress on the socialist road, was another heavy blow to the imperialist front, which had already been greatly weakened after World War II. The tremendous development of the socialist camp, which has a population of 950 million, and the tremendous upsurge of the anti-imperialist national independence movement were greatly stimulated. Since World War II, in addition to the countries that have embarked on the socialist road, more than 700 million people have broken free from colonial shackles and established independent countries.

Recently, the Iraqi people broke the chains that imperialism had bound them with and entered the ranks of independent and autonomous countries. This is an inevitable product of the decline of imperialism and the disintegration of the colonialism system. Imperialists desperately slander this as a result of "infiltration" by socialist countries. This nonsense is not worth refuting. May we ask: Why have imperialist countries "infiltrated" these oppressed nations with various military, political, and economic ties for decades, but they cannot resist the "infiltration" of socialist countries' "propaganda" and disappear in one morning?

To be honest, the most powerful revolutionary agitators in Iraq and other oppressed nations are none other than the imperialists themselves. The brutal oppression and exploitation of the imperialists and their supported running dogs have created the revolutionary consciousness of the oppressed and exploited people, forcing them to embark on the revolutionary road, and they have no other way to survive. Without such a driving force, no revolution can occur or be imagined.

All objective observers can think about whether the facts are indeed so.

Contrary to the socialist camp, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States extremely hates all national independence and liberation movements. The United States once supported France's aggression against Vietnam; shielded the Dutch colonialists' occupation of West Irian, interfering in the Indonesian people's anti-Dutch movement; and declared India's Goa to be a "province of Portugal." The United States regards Latin America as its own backyard, carrying out insatiable plunder and unbridled enslavement. The United States occupies our territory of Taiwan. And for a long time, the U.S. imperialism, which has always disguised itself as a friend of the Arab countries, openly invaded the Middle East this time in collusion with Britain, thoroughly exposing the United States as the most ferocious enemy of the people of the Middle East.

The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is just another name for colonialism. When the United States peddled the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the past, and even today when it is carrying out armed interference in the internal affairs of the Arab countries, it is still promoting myths such as "preventing Soviet infiltration" and "preventing the threat of communism." However, these myths can only prove that U.S. imperialism wants to use the smokescreen of "anti-Soviet" and "anti-communist" to control and interfere as much as possible in the vast intermediate zone between socialist countries and the United States, first and foremost the colonial and semi-colonial world that old-line imperialists such as Britain and France can no longer rule.

However, lies cannot go far. All the contradictions within the capitalist system are deepening, and the anti-colonialist struggle of the oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is rising. The countries and peoples in these regions have increasingly clearly recognized that U.S. imperialism is the number one colonialist today. If in the Suez Canal incident, the United States could still pretend to be a kind-hearted grandmother, then in this Middle East incident, the wolf's teeth of the United States are fully exposed, and all sweet words can no longer cover up the truth of its gunboat policy. At the same time, socialist countries not only use their own powerful strength and unity to prevent imperialism from touching them, but also use their own resolute attitude in safeguarding world peace and justice to prevent imperialism from suppressing national independence movements. This makes it impossible for the people of the world not to see clearly: In the struggle to maintain peace and oppose aggression, in the struggle against imperialism and its colonial policies, socialist countries and national independence movements share weal and woe. The existence and development of socialist countries, and the sympathy and support of socialist countries for national independence movements, have greatly helped the development and victory of this movement; at the same time, the upsurge of national independence movements has weakened the aggressive forces of imperialism, thus benefiting the construction and development of socialist countries and strengthening the forces defending world peace.

Socialist forces and national independence movements thus support each other, combine with each other, and converge into a huge trend to bury colonialism. This torrent has broken through the chains of colonial rule in vast areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in the thirteen years since World War II, but it has not yet completely eliminated it. Marked by the Iraqi revolution, the anti-colonialist struggle is entering a new period of upsurge. The more the imperialists use force to threaten this struggle, the more fiercely the flames of anti-colonialism will burn, and the closer the union of the national liberation movement and the socialist movement will be. Today it has broken down another link in the imperialist front in the Middle East, and tomorrow it will surely break down another link in Latin America. In the situation where the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, colonialism and imperialism will ultimately not be able to escape their final death.

### 一切争取解放的民族的最忠实朋友

    一切争取解放的民族的最忠实朋友
    一切争取自由、独立的民族，从最近中东人民所遭到的美英帝国主义新侵略的患难中，又一次上了生动的一课。谁是朋友，谁是敌人，格外分明。
    当伊拉克爱国军人取得人民的支持，推翻了费萨尔王朝，建立了伊拉克共和国的时候，以苏联为首的社会主义各国，无不热烈庆贺伊拉克人民反对帝国主义斗争的胜利。而伊拉克共和国的成立，对于以巴格达条约来奴役中东，保持在中东的殖民统治，并且急图侵入中东，在“艾森豪威尔主义”掩护之下的美帝国主义，却如晴天霹雳，立即同英国一起，不顾挑起世界大战的危险，剥下一切伪善的面具，相继派兵登陆黎巴嫩和约旦，妄想以武力扑灭高涨的阿拉伯民族独立解放运动。
    美英的侵略行动，威胁到伊拉克和阿拉伯联合共和国，破坏了中东的和平，使世界面临新战争的危险。苏联和中国相继发表强硬的声明，警告美英的侵略罪行，要求美英从黎巴嫩和约旦撤兵，支持阿拉伯人民的斗争，表示了不能袖手旁观的决心。在十二个社会主义国家里，从北京到莫斯科，从平壤到柏林，广大的人民普遍举行了反侵略示威，向中东人民伸出援助的双手。
    当美英侵占黎巴嫩和约旦，企图进一步侵入伊拉克共和国，中东局势剑拔弩张的时候，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同纳赛尔举行了会谈，讨论了制止对阿拉伯世界的侵略以及维护阿拉伯国家独立的措施。苏联和保加利亚，沿着北高加索和黑海举行了军事演习，并且及时警告了企图侵犯伊拉克的土耳其。苏联并且声明要尽一切可能，使伊拉克共和国得以巩固，苏联愿意尽一切可能帮助殖民地人民获得解放和民族独立。
    阿拉伯人民反侵略的坚决斗争，以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的有力支持，全世界一切爱好和平的人民反对美英侵略、维护世界和平的洪流，遏制了美英帝国主义扩大侵略的计划，迫使它们接受苏联坐下来谈判的建议。
    上面这些事实，再一次证明，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是世界和平的有力支柱。以苏联为首的社会主义各国，是阿拉伯民族和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲一切被压迫民族争取解放的最可靠的朋友。
    社会主义国家对中东人民，以及对一切被压迫民族和被侵略的国家反对殖民主义和维护民族独立的斗争，给予深切的同情和不遗余力的支持，并不是从现在才开始。从世界上还只有一个社会主义国家苏联的年代，到已有十二个国家结成强大的社会主义阵营的今天，社会主义各国一贯采取着这种明确的无产阶级的国际主义的立场。说远的，当俄国十月革命推翻沙皇和资产阶级临时政府、取得政权之后，就在人类历史上破天荒的第一次地马上宣布取消帝俄时代对于中国和其他国家的一切不平等条约，取消帝俄对于殖民地半殖民地的一切奴役制度。说近的，是谁在联合国和其他国际会议上，不断地揭露和抨击帝国主义的侵略和干涉，坚决捍卫一切被压迫被侵略的民族的利益？是谁坚决支持印度人民收复果阿的斗争、印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的斗争，而当印度尼西亚遭到外国干涉的严重的危险的时候，严正地警告了帝国主义？是谁无保留地支持北非人民和阿尔及利亚人民的反对殖民统治的斗争、支持亚非许多独立新生的国家？又是谁在1956年、1957年和现在，当侵略战争的乌云已经笼罩到埃及、叙利亚和伊拉克的时候，给予阿拉伯人民以最大的声援，制止了侵略者的血手？尽人皆知，这就是以苏联为首的社会主义各国。为了帮助一切翻身的被压迫国家发展经济，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，不附带任何政治条件地帮助许多亚非国家发展自己的独立的经济。这些都是任何造谣诬蔑挑拨离间所改变不了的事实。
    帝国主义者往往中伤社会主义国家对民族解放运动的同情和积极支持，是什么“扩张”、“间接侵略”和“渗入”。作为帝国主义者，他们确是想不通为什么社会主义国家能够这样始终一贯地援助一切被压迫被侵略的民族，而不抱任何损人利己的目的。对于某些久受压迫和侵略的国家和人民来说，由于历史的经验，也往往对社会主义国家的积极援助一时不能够完全了解。这是不足怪的。
    无产阶级和它的先锋队共产党，是国际主义者。它的崇高的奋斗目标，是追求一个没有人剥削人的社会制度。因之，就必然坚决反对一个民族压迫另一个民族。正像马克思所教导人们的：“压迫其他民族的民族，是不能够自由的。”所以一切社会主义国家和共产党，坚决反对帝国主义的侵略，为民族的独立解放而斗争，并且深切地同情和积极支持一切被压迫的民族和被侵略的国家反对殖民主义和维护民族独立的斗争。社会主义国家把它对一切反殖民主义的斗争的支援，都看成是自己的不可推诿的义务。
    十月革命给全世界工人阶级和被压迫民族的解放事业开辟了广大的可能性和现实的道路。十月社会主义革命的胜利和苏联所实行的对一切被压迫民族平等友好的政策，第一次震撼了帝国主义的殖民体系，唤醒了被压迫民族。长期受过帝国主义压迫和侵略的中国，它的人民革命的胜利，它在社会主义道路上的突飞猛进，对于在第二次世界大战后已经大大削弱的帝国主义阵线又是沉重的一击。大大激起了拥有九亿五千万人口的社会主义阵营的巨大发展，鼓舞了反帝国主义的民族独立运动的巨大高涨。第二次世界大战以后，除了走上了社会主义道路的国家以外，已经有七亿多人挣脱了殖民枷锁，建立了独立的国家。
    最近，伊拉克人民又打断了帝国主义束缚在他们身上的铁链，走进了独立自主国家的行列。这是帝国主义没落和殖民主义体系瓦解过程的必然产物，帝国主义者穷极无聊地污蔑这是什么社会主义国家“渗透”的结果。这种胡说是不值一驳的。试问：为什么帝国主义国家对这些被压迫民族用各种军事、政治、经济和各种条约束缚，“渗透”了几十年，却抵抗不了社会主义国家“宣传”的“渗透”，在一个早上就灰飞烟灭呢？
    老实说，在伊拉克和其他被压迫民族最有力的革命煽动者，不是别人，正是帝国主义者自己。帝国主义者及其所扶持的走狗的残酷的压迫和剥削，造成了被压迫被剥削人民的革命觉悟，迫使他们走上革命的道路，除此而外，他们再也没有别的生路。离开这样一种动力，任何革命都不可能发生，也不可能想像。
    一切客观的观察家都可以想一想，事实究竟是不是如此。
    同社会主义阵营相反，以美国为首的帝国主义集团极端仇恨一切民族独立解放运动。美国曾经支持法国对越南的侵略；庇护荷兰殖民者对西伊里安的占领，干涉印度尼西亚人民的反荷运动；宣布印度的果阿是“葡萄牙的一个省”。美国把拉丁美洲看成是自己的后院，进行贪得无厌的掠夺和肆无忌惮的奴役。美国霸占了我国的领土台湾。而长期以来，一向伪装成阿拉伯国家的朋友的美帝国主义，这次伙同英国公然侵略中东，就彻底暴露了美国是中东人民的最凶恶的敌人，
  “艾森豪威尔主义”不过是殖民主义的别名。美国在过去兜售“艾森豪威尔主义”的时候，甚至在武装干涉阿拉伯各国人民的内政的今天，还在宣扬什么“防止苏联渗入”、“防止共产主义威胁”等等神话。然而，这种神话只能证明美帝国主义想借“防苏”“防共”的烟幕，尽可能地控制和干涉处在社会主义国家和美国之间的广大中间地带，首先是那些英法等老牌帝国主义已经无法统治的殖民地半殖民地世界。
    但是，谎话的腿是跑不远的。资本主义体系内部的一切矛盾日益加深，亚、非和拉丁美洲被压迫民族的反殖民主义的斗争日益高涨，这些地区的国家和人民已经愈来愈清楚地认识到美帝国主义是当前头号殖民主义者。如果在苏伊士运河事件中，美国还能伪装是一个好心的外婆的话，那么，在这一次的中东事件中，美国的狼牙齿就完全露出来了，一切甜言蜜语再也不能掩盖它的炮舰政策的真相了。同时，社会主义国家不但以自己的强大力量和团结一致，使帝国主义不敢去碰它，而且以自己坚决地维护世界的和平和正义的态度，制止帝国主义对民族独立运动的镇压。这就使全世界人民不能不看得清清楚楚：在维护和平、反对侵略的斗争中，在反对帝国主义及其殖民政策的斗争中，社会主义国家和民族独立运动是共祸福同呼吸的。社会主义国家的存在和发展，社会主义国家对于民族独立运动的同情和支持，大大地帮助了这一运动的发展和胜利；同时，民族独立运动的高涨，又削弱了帝国主义的侵略势力，因而有利于社会主义国家的建设和发展，加强了保卫世界和平的力量。
    社会主义力量和民族独立运动，就这样彼此支持，互相结合，汇成埋葬殖民主义的巨大潮流。这个洪流在第二次世界大战以后的十三年中，已经在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的广大地区冲破了殖民主义统治的锁链，但是还没有把它完全消灭。以伊拉克革命为标志，反殖民主义斗争正在进到一个新的高潮时期。帝国主义者愈是对这个斗争实行武力威胁，反殖民主义的火焰就只会燃烧得愈加炽烈，而民族解放运动和社会主义运动的联合也就只会愈加紧密。今天它在中东冲垮了帝国主义阵线的又一个环节，明天它也必将在拉丁美洲冲垮另一个环节。在东风继续压倒西风的形势下，殖民主义和帝国主义终将无法逃脱最后的死亡。
