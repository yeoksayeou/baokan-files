Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 19th: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia has issued a statement on the situation in the Middle East, strongly condemning the aggressive actions of the United States and Britain in the Middle East. The statement said that all peace-loving governments and peoples must rise up to oppose the heinous actions of the United States and Britain.

The statement, published in today's Jakarta "People's Daily," calls on the Indonesian people, especially the Indonesian working class, to launch a movement in the spirit of internationalism to support the Arab people, in order to defend the newborn Republic of Iraq, demand that the United States and Britain withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and restore a peaceful atmosphere between all countries.

The statement reiterated the position of the Communist Party of Indonesia that if the United States does not promptly cease its aggressive actions against Lebanon, American enterprises in Indonesia will suffer the same fate as British and French enterprises suffered when their governments invaded Egypt. The same applies to Britain. The statement called on Indonesian workers in American enterprises to prepare to take concrete action.

The statement calls on the Indonesian government to recognize the Republic of Iraq without hesitation. The statement said that the struggle of the Iraqi people is the struggle of all people who cherish freedom and democracy, and therefore also the struggle of the Indonesian people.

The statement said that the victory of the Iraqi people in overthrowing the monarchy, which served as a proxy for imperialism, has opened the way for the Iraqi people to achieve complete independence and democracy, and at the same time, this is a fatal blow to the Baghdad Pact.

    印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局声明
    严斥美英侵略中东罪恶行动
    新华社雅加达19日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局发表了一项关于中东局势的声明，严厉谴责美英在中东的侵略行为。声明说，所有爱好和平的政府和人民必须起来反对美国和英国的罪恶行动。
    这篇刊载在今天的雅加达“人民日报”上的声明号召印度尼西亚人民，特别是印度尼西亚的工人阶级，以国际主义精神，发动支持阿拉伯人民的运动，以便保卫新生的伊拉克共和国，要求美英把它们的军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，并且恢复所有国家之间的和平气氛。
    声明重申印度尼西亚共产党的立场说，如果美国不迅速停止它对黎巴嫩的侵略行为，美国在印度尼西亚的企业就将遭到英法企业在它们的政府侵略埃及时所遭到的同样命运。对英国来说也是一样。声明号召美国企业中的印度尼西亚工人准备采取具体的行动。
    声明要求印度尼西亚政府毫不迟疑地承认伊拉克共和国。声明说，伊拉克人民的斗争就是一切珍视自由和民主的人民所进行的斗争，因此也就是印度尼西亚人民的斗争。
    声明说，伊拉克人民在推翻作为帝国主义替身的君主政体中所获得的胜利，为伊拉克人民争取完全独立和民主打开了道路，同时，这也是给予巴格达条约的致命打击。
