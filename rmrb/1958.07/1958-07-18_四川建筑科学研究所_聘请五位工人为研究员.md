Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 17th. Five construction workers in Sichuan Province have recently been hired as researchers by the Provincial Institute of Architectural Science. They are carpenter Lin Ruiting, sawyer Lü Fangyun, jackhammer operator Xiang Xianyi, bricklayer Yang Changshi, and Gu Shizhang.

These five construction workers had never attended any specialized schools. Lin Ruiting only had a primary school education, Xiang Xianyi only studied for three years, and Gu Shizhang was still semi-illiterate. However, they possess a daring and proactive communist spirit, courageously engaging in arduous research, and have created many astonishing achievements in production. As early as 1955, the young bricklayer Yang Changshi created the mobile assembly line operation method, increasing the number of bricks laid from more than 1,700 per day to 3,600, setting a new national bricklaying record. In February of this year, he also invented the "cuo piao" mortar applicator, which not only solved the problem of not being able to use mortar applicators for window jambs, but also greatly reduced the labor intensity of bricklayers. At the National Bricklaying Comprehensive Technical Appraisal Conference held this year, Yang Changshi's "cuo piao" mortar applicator and his operation method were listed as one of the twelve advanced bricklaying tools and advanced bricklaying methods in the country. The young jackhammer operator Xiang Xianyi, after being transferred to the Sichuan Shizitan Hydropower Station in 1954, diligently studied and researched, quickly mastered the operating techniques of the jackhammer, and in May of this year, he created a "multi-jackhammer operating machine," which allowed one person to supervise ten jackhammers simultaneously, increasing work efficiency tenfold. Soon after, he successfully created an automatic slag removal machine for earthwork excavation, eliminating the need for manual carrying of earth and stone in earthwork excavation.

    四川建筑科学研究所
    聘请五位工人为研究员
    新华社成都17日电　四川省有五位建筑工人最近被省建筑科学研究所聘为研究员。他们是木工林瑞廷、锯工吕方云、风钻工向贤益、砖工杨长诗和古世章。
    这五位建筑工人过去都没有进过什么专门学校，林瑞廷只有小学文化程度，向贤益只读过三年书，古世章还是个半文盲。但是他们具有敢想敢做的共产主义风格，勇于刻苦钻研，在生产中创造了许多惊人的事迹。早在1955年，青年砖工杨长诗就创造了活动升线巡回流水操作法，使砌砖数量由每天一千七百多块提高到三千六百块，创造了全国砌砖新纪录。今年2月，他又创造了撮瓢铺灰器，不仅解决了窗间墙不能使用铺灰器的问题，而且大大减低了砖工的劳动强度。在今年召开的全国砌砖综合技术鉴定会上，杨长诗的撮瓢铺灰器和他的操作法，被列为全国十二种先进砌砖工具和先进砌砖法之一。青年风钻工向贤益1954年调到四川狮子滩水力发电站当风钻工后，刻苦学习钻研，很快就掌握了风钻的操作技术，并在今年5月创造了一部“多台风钻操纵机”，使一个人可以同时看管十台风钻，工作效率提高十倍。不久，他又创造成功了一部土石方开挖自动出渣机，消灭了土石方开挖中人背肩挑的现象。
