Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 27th: The Cairo newspaper "Al-Gomhouria" published an editorial today stating that Eisenhower, in his reply to Khrushchev, created obstacles to the convening of a summit conference, which can only have one purpose: to strike a blow at the idea of a summit conference and indefinitely postpone the meeting.

The editorial said that this is further proof that the US strategy is to push the world to the brink of war, intensify international tensions, and keep the world under a persistent threat of war.

The editorial said that Eisenhower's reply also provides new evidence that the United States does not respect world public opinion and the will of the people who urgently demand a summit conference. In doing so, the United States is playing with fire.

"Al Shaab" believes that the United States and Britain may be adopting the same attitude that Britain and France adopted when they invaded Port Said. Britain and France actively carried out military preparations while Egypt was preparing to hold negotiations with them, and launched an invasion on the very day the negotiations were scheduled to begin. The commentary pointed out that today's situation is different from yesterday's. If the US and British governments take reckless action, a volcano will erupt, and they will be the first to be destroyed.

    美国企图使用缓兵之计
    开罗报纸抨击艾森豪威尔复信
    据新华社开罗27日电　开罗“共和国报”今天发表社论说，艾森豪威尔在答复赫鲁晓夫的信中对召开政府首脑会议制造障碍，这只能有一个目的，那就是打击召开首脑会议的主意并且使这个会议无定期地推迟举行。
    社论说，这又一次证明，美国的计策是把世界推到战争边缘上，加剧国际紧张局势，并且使世界处于持久的战争威胁之下。
    社论说，艾森豪威尔的复信还提供了一个新的证据，证明美国不尊重世界舆论和迫切要求召开政府首脑会议的人民的意志。在这样做的时候，美国是在玩火。
      “人民报”认为，美英两国可能正在采取英法两国在侵犯塞得港时曾经采取过的态度。英法两国曾经在埃及准备同它们举行谈判的时候，积极进行军事准备工作，而且就在预定举行谈判的那一天发动了侵略。评论指出，但是今天的情况已经不同于昨天，如果美英两国政府采取鲁莽行动，火山就会爆发，它们自己首先要遭到毁灭。
