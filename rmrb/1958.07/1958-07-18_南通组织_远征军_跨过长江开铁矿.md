Nanjing, July 17th (reported by reporter Zhang Jing): Carrying their luggage and crossing the Yangtze River to bring the iron mountains of southern Jiangsu to northern Jiangsu! This is the heroic determination of the people of Nantong City, a place "without an inch of iron," to march towards steel production. The entire city of Nantong will organize a 3,000-person "mining expeditionary force" to mine iron ore in the resource-rich Zhenjiang area south of the Yangtze River.

The first and second batches of the river-crossing mining teams, consisting of over 380 people, voluntarily signed up under the enthusiastic encouragement of the nationwide steel production campaign. Most of them are rickshaw and tricycle workers. Now, this vanguard of over 300 people, led by Deputy Mayor Wang Minzhi, has traveled over 700 *li* by land and water to the town of Xiashu on the south bank of the Yangtze River. They have set up positions on the sparsely populated Cishan Tou, Yingpan Shan, and Kongqing Shan, using iron bars and pickaxes to open mountains and split ridges.

The mining project is being carried out under extremely difficult conditions. The mountain cliffs are steep and the roads are treacherous. Sometimes, the scorching sun bakes the iron ore, making it unbearably hot; sometimes, torrential rain washes down the mountain rocks. However, the workers have always persevered on the mountain, sweating and soaking in the rain to remove soil, drill holes, blast, and dig. Now, they have set up tents on the mountain and even built a large reed shed that can accommodate 60 people. The first group of more than 40 workers has already mined more than 30 tons of iron ore.

Xu Zhi, the Secretary of the Nantong Municipal Party Committee, recently went to the mountain to慰问 (offer regards to) the workers of the mining team. He was deeply moved by the soaring enthusiasm of the mining workers. On the 10th, he had originally planned to return, but halfway there, he couldn't bear to leave this boiling mining mountain, so he turned back. The next day, he personally led more than 100 workers to climb another new mountain – Kongqing Shan – and worked with the workers for half a day, opening up a new mining position. He also wrote several clappers for the workers, one of which goes like this:

Iron sand covers the green hills,
Today we want you to cross the Yangtze,
If we don't carry you into Nantong City,
Heroes swear not to return home.

The third batch of the 3,000-person mining team in Nantong City is being organized. With even more magnificent spirit, they will trample the turbulent Yangtze River water and move the iron treasure mountain of southern Jiangsu. By the end of this year, 70,000 tons of iron and 10,000 tons of steel will be produced from this Nantong city, which is rich in cotton and yarn.

### 南通组织“远征军”跨过长江开铁矿

    南通组织“远征军”跨过长江开铁矿
    本报南京17日电　记者张竞报道：背上行装，跨过长江，把江南的铁山搬到江北去！这是“地无寸铁”的南通市人民向钢铁进军的豪迈决心。全南通市将组织三千人的“开矿远征军”，到长江以南矿藏丰富的镇江地区开采铁矿。
    参加第一、二批的渡江开采大队的三百八十多人，都是在全民大办钢铁的热情鼓舞下自愿报名的，其中大部分是人力车、三轮车工人。现在，这三百多人的先头大队，已在王敏之副市长带领下，水陆兼程，跋涉七百多里，来到大江南岸的下蜀镇，分别在人烟稀少的磁山头、营盘山和空青山上摆开阵势，用铁钎和洋镐开山劈岭。
    开采工程是在万分艰难的条件下进行的。山崖陡峭，道路险阻。有时炎日当空，烤得遍地铁石炽热逼人；有时倾盆暴雨，冲得山石滚滚而下。但是工人们始终坚持在山头，一身汗一身雨地排土，凿洞，放炮，挖掘。现在，他们已在山上张起帐篷，还自己动手搭了一座可容六十人住的大芦席棚。第一批上山的四十多名工人，已经开采了三十多吨铁矿石。
    南通市委书记徐智同志最近特地到山上去慰问了采矿队的工人。他也深为开矿工人冲天的干劲所感动。10日那天，他本来已经打算回去，可是走到半路上，怎么也舍不得离开这个沸腾的矿山，中途又折了回来。第二天，他亲自带了一百多工人爬上另一个新的山头——空青山，和工人们一起劳动了半天，开辟了新的开采阵地。他还给工人编了几首快板，其中有一首是这样唱的：
    铁砂布满青山岗，
    今日里要你过长江，
    不把你背进南通城，
    英雄们誓不还家乡。
    南通市第三批三千人的开采大队，正在组织中。他们将以更宏伟的气魄，踏破滔滔长江水，移走江南铁宝山。到今年年底，将有七万吨铁和一万吨钢，从这个盛产棉花和纱布的南通城里生产出来。
