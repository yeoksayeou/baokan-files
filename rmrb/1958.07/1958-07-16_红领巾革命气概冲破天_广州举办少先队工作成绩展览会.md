Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 15th: The Young Pioneers' work achievement exhibition currently being held in Guangzhou reflects the revolutionary spirit and the spirit of being the masters of their own house shown by the Young Pioneers.

	Upon entering the exhibition room in the central area, a wave of fragrance hits you. This is the scent emanating from the talcum powder, perfume, hair growth oil, and other products processed by the Red Scarves' processing factory of Xinglong Elementary School in the central district. From May to now, they have processed quite a few products for the Meiguang Daily Necessities Cooperative. The industrial products of the middle school Young Pioneers are even more diverse. The Young Pioneer handcarts produced by the carpentry workshop of the Third Municipal Middle School are both nimble and can carry a lot. The artificial fibers made from wild ramie by the Second Municipal Middle School and the non-clinker cement and plastics successfully trial-produced by the Fifth Municipal Middle School are all displayed in the exhibition. A total of exhibits from one hundred Red Scarves' factories are on display at the exhibition. These many small factories were mostly set up by the Young Pioneers after hearing that Guangzhou was to be built into a South China industrial base. When the Young Pioneers of Guangya Middle School learned that steel was the foundation of all industries, they stubbornly produced steel.

	A bunch of golden rice is displayed in a prominent place. This bunch of rice ears is full of grain. Casually picking the one with the most, it turns out to have four hundred and twenty-two grains. This is the product of the Huanghua New Village Elementary School's Young Pioneers' farm. Their farm's rice paddy area is more than one mu, and last year's annual output was four hundred jin. What about this year? The Young Pioneers, like the farmers, ploughed deeply and cultivated meticulously, accumulated a large amount of fertilizer, and also consulted with the agricultural cooperatives. As a result, the early rice crop yielded one thousand four hundred and forty jin.

	Red Scarves are also builders of the city. The Young Pioneers throughout the city have planted more than 480,000 flowers, trees, and castor bean plants to green and beautify the city.

    红领巾革命气概冲破天
    广州举办少先队工作成绩展览会
    据新华社广州15日电　正在广州市举办的少先队工作成绩展览会，反映了少先队员们的革命气概和小主人的精神。
    进了中区的展览室，一阵阵的香味扑来，原来这是中区兴隆小学红领巾加工厂加工的爽身粉、香水，生发油等散发出来的香味。他们从5月到现在已为美光日用品合作社加工了不少产品。中学少先队员的工业产品更加丰富多采。市三中的木工厂制出的少先号手推车，既灵巧又载得多。市二中用野桑麻制的人造纤维，市五中试制成功的无熟料水泥、塑料等，都陈列在展览会里。在展览会里共展出了一百间红领巾工厂的展品，这许多小工厂，大多数是少先队员们听到广州市要建成华南工业基地后办起来的。当广雅中学的少先队员知道钢是一切工业的根子时，他们便顽强地炼出钢来了。
    一束金黄的水稻陈列在显眼的地方，这一束稻穗结实累累，随手拣了一穗最多的，数一数竟有四百二十二颗谷粒。这是黄花新村小学少年农场的产品。他们农场的稻田面积有一亩多，去年年产四百斤。今年呢？少先队员也像农民一样，深耕细作，大量积肥，又去向农业社请教，结果早造竟收了一千四百四十斤。
    红领巾也是城市的建设者。全市少先队员为绿化、美化城市共栽种了花卉、树木和蓖麻四十八万多株。
