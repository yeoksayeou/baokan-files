Xinhua News Agency, July 25th, Washington D.C.: Some Western news agencies and American newspapers continue to comment on Khrushchev's proposal for a summit meeting within the framework of the Security Council and the counter-proposals that the United States may put forward.

　　Agence France-Presse reported on the 24th that due to the Soviet proposal, "the United States is already in an extremely difficult and passive position," and that "it is now very difficult, perhaps impossible, for the United States to retract its earlier promise to convene a United Nations summit meeting." The news agency also said that domestic political factors in the United States would also affect the Eisenhower administration's attitude. With the November congressional elections approaching, the U.S. government will have to take a "positive" attitude to avoid being accused in the election campaign of not valuing the opportunity to guarantee world peace.

　　However, it can be seen from some reports that although the U.S. government has not yet formally responded to the Soviet proposal, it is preparing to delay and obstruct the early holding of the meeting with various excuses. According to members of Congress who attended a briefing hosted by an expert from the State Department, the U.S. government will not fully accept the Soviet proposal and will put forward U.S. conditions for holding the proposed meeting. Regarding these conditions, according to the "New York Herald Tribune," which reflects the views of the Republican government, the focus will be on the timing, composition, and agenda of the meeting.

　　American newspapers generally believe that on the issue of timing, the United States will not agree to hold a meeting on the 28th. They pointed out that the State Department and the White House have recently announced for days that despite receiving the Soviet proposal, Dulles' overseas travel schedule has not changed. This shows that the United States is not prepared to accept the proposal to hold a summit meeting within the Security Council on the 28th.

　　On the issue of membership, according to American news agencies, the United States will try to create obstacles on this issue by using the excuse that India and many Arab countries are not members of the Security Council. At the same time, the United States also emphasized the so-called "orderly procedures" and the "rules" of the Security Council, preparing to use these issues to bargain in order to delay the meeting.

　　According to the Associated Press, Eisenhower and Dulles "are apparently trying to delay this meeting for two weeks." The news agency's reporter, Hightower, also said, when talking about the fundamental attitude of the U.S. government towards convening a summit meeting within the Security Council, that the Eisenhower administration is actually unwilling to hold a summit meeting now, whether within or outside the United Nations. Because U.S. officials believe that if such a meeting is held, when discussing the reasons and possible consequences of the armed intervention in the Middle East by the United States and Britain, Khrushchev will be in the position of "plaintiff" and the United States will be in the position of "defendant." In the view of the United States, this situation is "extremely unfavorable" to the United States politically and in terms of propaganda.

    西方通讯社和美国报纸透露
    美国极被动　力图拖时间
    据新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：一些西方通讯社和美国报刊继续对赫鲁晓夫关于在安全理事会范围内召开首脑会议和美国可能提出的反建议发表评论。
    法新社24日消息说，由于苏联的建议，“美国已经处于极端困难而被动的地位”，“美国现在要想收回早些时候同意召开联合国最高级会议的诺言，那是十分困难的，或许还是不可能的。这家通讯社还说，美国国内的政治因素也将影响艾森豪威尔政府的态度。由于11月的国会选举将来临，美国政府将不得不采取“积极”态度，以免有人在竞选运动中指责政府对保证世界和平的机会不予重视。
    但是，从一些消息中可以看出，美国政府目前虽然还没有正式答复苏联的建议，但是它正在准备以各种借口拖延和阻挠会议的早日举行。据参加过国务院一位专家主持的汇报会议的国会议员说，美国政府将不会完全接受苏联的建议，并且将对举行建议中的会议提出美国的条件。关于这些条件，据反映共和党政府意见的“纽约先驱论坛报”说，将集中在会议的时间、组成和议题方面。
    美国报刊普遍认为，在时间问题上，美国不会同意在28日举行会议。它们指出，国务院和白宫最近连日宣布，尽管收到苏联的建议，杜勒斯出国日程仍然没有改变。这就表明，美国并没有准备接受在28日举行安全理事会内的政府首脑会议的建议的打算。
    在成员问题上，据美国通讯社说，美国将借口印度和阿拉伯许多国家不是安全理事会成员国，在这个问题上设法制造障碍。同时，美国还强调所谓“有条有理的程序”以及安全理事会的“规则”，准备利用这些问题讨价还价，以便对会议进行拖延。
    据美联社说，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯“显然正在设法把这次会议拖延两个星期”。这家通讯社的记者海托华在谈到美国政府对召开安全理事会范围内的首脑会议的根本态度时还说，艾森豪威尔政府其实不愿意现在举行最高级会议，不论在联合国内还是联合国外。因为美国官员认为：如果举行这样的会议，在讨论到美英两国武装干涉中东的原因和可能的后果时，赫鲁晓夫站的是“原告地位”，美国站的是“被告地位”。而在美国看来，这种局面在政治上和宣传上对美国都是“极为不利”的。
