    The Road of Nationalities Research
    Ya Hanzhang

    Since the national liberation, although it has been less than nine years, under the leadership of the Party, the nearly 40 million minority people across the country have experienced a historical period equal to thousands of years. Many ethnic groups have not only surpassed the development stage of capitalist society, but even surpassed two or three social stages that general development needs to go through, directly transitioning from the initial forms of primitive communes, slave society, and feudal society to socialist society. In a short period of time, the minority people have gotten rid of the backward state of poverty and ignorance, entered a new historical era of civilization and happiness, and joined the ranks of advanced nations. With the rapid development of minority nationalities, nationalities research has also made remarkable achievements.

    However, the development of nationalities research has not been smooth sailing. Here, like all other work, there is also a struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois roads, and two methods. Bourgeois right-wingers such as Fei Xiaotong once attempted to seize and usurp the leadership of nationalities research; the reactionary views and methods of bourgeois ethnology and sociology still bind the minds and hands of a considerable number of nationalities researchers. At the same time, some researchers have a tendency to be detached from politics, the masses, and reality. The manifestation of being detached from politics is being detached from the leadership of the Party, and unwilling to work under the leadership of local Party committees; detached from the Party's ethnic policies, detached from the Party's political movements, research work does not serve the current political movements. The manifestation of being detached from the masses is doing research behind closed doors, and not being able to analyze and improve the problems raised by the masses; some people, when conducting investigations, follow the upper-level mass line, specifically looking for landlords and class elements who have been overthrown to investigate, instead of investigating the broad masses of the minority nationalities. The main manifestation of being detached from reality is using subjective methods to force problems conceived in one's mind into reality to be verified, instead of starting from reality to investigate the actual situation. For example, some people specialize in investigating those unimportant exotic customs, and even low-level, vulgar things. The above-mentioned all run counter to the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method, and seriously damage and hinder the correct development of nationalities research.

    Studying ethnic issues should first and foremost be conducive to solving ethnic problems, conducive to ethnic unity, and conducive to the interests of all ethnic groups. Therefore, research work should be closely integrated with the problems existing in ethnic work, and whether studying history or the present situation, it should focus on the broad working people. If we distort, exaggerate, or even discriminate against and insult the minority nationalities regarding their certain backward phenomena, then we are standing on the erroneous position of Han chauvinism; on the other hand, if we do not recognize that there are still some backward aspects in the economic and cultural development of the minority nationalities, and describe these backward things as revolutionary and progressive, or even deliberately obliterate class contradictions within the nationalities, then of course this is also wrong, this is local nationalism. It should be said that past history and historical materials contain truths, falsehoods, half-truths and half-falsehoods, and even complete falsehoods, which requires us to boldly analyze and study these materials realistically. All reactionary and decadent views that are not conducive to the development of nationalities and the construction of socialism should be criticized.

    This scientific discussion meeting on nationalities research has relatively thoroughly exposed and criticized the reactionary views and methods of bourgeois ethnology and sociology, and exposed and criticized the incorrect views and methods adopted by bourgeois nationalists, especially local nationalists, as well as the harm they have caused in their work. This has enabled nationalities researchers to recognize the ugly faces of bourgeois "ethnologists," recognize the malicious intentions of bourgeois nationalists, break the superstition that everyone has towards these "experts" and "scholars," and liberate their minds; at the same time, they have clearly realized that in order to do a good job in nationalities research, they must resolutely follow the Party's guidelines and policies, rely on the leadership of Party committees at all levels, and use the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method. Therefore, this struggle should be extended to all nationalities research units across the country, removing the white flags from every nationalities researcher and planting red flags, so that they have a firm proletarian stand, and strive to do a good job in nationalities research.

    民族研究工作的道路
    牙含章
    全国解放以后，虽然还不到九年的时间，但在党的领导下，全国近四千万少数民族人民却经历了等于数千年的历史时期，有许多民族不仅是超越了资本主义社会发展阶段，甚至超越了一般发展需要经历的两、三个社会阶段，由原始公社、奴隶社会、封建社会的初期形态直接过渡到社会主义社会。少数民族人民在短短的时期内摆脱了贫穷愚昧的落后状态，进入文明幸福的新的历史时代，跻于先进民族的行列。随着少数民族的飞跃发展，民族研究工作也取得了显著的成绩。
    但是，民族研究工作的开展，并不是一帆风顺的。在这里，同其它一切工作一样，也存在无产阶级和资产阶级的两条道路、两种方法的斗争。资产阶级右派分子如费孝通等，曾经一度企图把持和篡夺民族研究工作的领导权；资产阶级民族学和社会学的反动观点和方法还束缚了相当一部分民族研究工作者的头脑和手足。同时，还有一部分研究工作者，存在着脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离实际的倾向。脱离政治的表现就是脱离党的领导，不愿意在地方党委的领导下进行工作；离开了党的民族政策，离开了党的政治运动，研究工作不为当前的政治运动服务。脱离群众的表现，就是关着门坐在屋子里研究，对群众提出来的问题不能加以分析和提高；有些人作调查，走的是上层群众路线，专找被打倒的地主阶级分子去调查，而不向少数民族的广大劳动人民作调查。脱离实际的主要表现，就是用主观主义的方法，把个人脑子里想出来的问题硬拿到实际中去加以证实，而不是从实际出发去调查实际情况。如有的人专去调查那些无关紧要的奇风异俗，甚至低级趣味的东西。上述这些和马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法背道而驰，严重地损害和阻碍了民族研究工作的正确发展。
    研究民族问题，首先应该有利于解决民族问题，有利于民族团结，有利于各族人民的利益。因此，研究工作要同民族工作中存在的问题密切结合起来，无论研究历史和现况都应该着眼于广大的劳动人民。如果我们对少数民族的某些落后现象加以歪曲、夸大，甚至对少数民族人民加以歧视和侮辱，这就是站在大汉族主义的错误立场上；另一方面，如果不承认少数民族的经济和文化的发展上还有某些落后的地方，把这些落后的东西描写成为革命的、进步的，甚至于故意抹煞民族内部的阶级矛盾，这当然也是错误的，这是地方民族主义。应该说，过去的历史和历史材料，有真有假，有半真半假甚至全假的，这就要求我们对这些材料大胆地实事求是地加以分析研究。对那些不适合民族发展，不利于社会主义建设的反动的陈腐的观点，都应加以批判。
    这次民族研究工作科学讨论会，比较彻底地揭发和批判了资产阶级民族学和社会学的反动观点和方法，揭露和批判了资产阶级民族主义特别是地方民族主义分子所采用的不正确的观点和方法，以及他们在工作中所造成的危害。这就使民族研究工作者认清了资产阶级“民族学家”的丑恶面目，认识了资产阶级民族主义者的恶毒用心，破除了大家对这些“专家”、“学者”的迷信，解放了思想；同时明确地认识到，要作好民族研究工作，必须坚决遵照党的方针政策，依靠各级地方党委的领导，运用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法。因此，应当把这一斗争扩展到全国各个民族研究工作单位中去，在每一个民族研究工作者身上拔掉白旗，插上红旗，使他们具有坚定的无产阶级立场，力争把民族研究工作做好。
