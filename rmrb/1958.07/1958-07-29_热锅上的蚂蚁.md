    Ants on a Hot Pan

    According to a Washington dispatch published in the British "Daily Mail": "Mr. Eisenhower has been feeling anxious since ordering the U.S. Marines to land in Lebanon," "He is now pacing back and forth in his office day after day," "He insists on being told the smallest details. Almost every hour, he sends instructions to the Department of Defense like cannon fire." The President's mood at this moment is understandable, just as the trembling mood of a murderer and arsonist after being arrested is understandable.
    Chinese sayings always compare those who are restless and uneasy due to special events to "ants on a hot pan." Eisenhower is playing with fire and burning himself, recklessly taking the risk of offending the whole world and stepping into the fire pit of invading the Middle East. Isn't he feeling like an ant falling into a hot pan, finding himself with no way out?
    Of course, Eisenhower is not the only one actually in the state of ants on a hot pan. U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy and Deputy Secretary Calles testified before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee, saying that the United States does not currently have, nor will it have in the "foreseeable future," a way to defend against Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles. The chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee, Democratic Senate leader Johnson, accused the U.S. Department of Defense of lacking a "serious sense of urgency" in this regard. But the secretaries of defense replied: Who can prove that there is a "lack of a serious sense of urgency"? The "sense of urgency" exists, but technically, no defense method can be found. Isn't this another display of anxiety? In fact, those warmongers who engage in atomic blackmail are the most cowardly and afraid of death. They live in constant fear all day long. They are very clear that if they dare to launch an atomic war, intercontinental missiles will fall on their own heads. And this is exactly what they cannot defend against.
    When Eisenhower and his accomplices—a handful of imperialist warmongers—launched the war of aggression in the Middle East, they probably did not expect that occupying "tiny" Lebanon and Jordan, and attempting to intimidate the people of the Middle East, would stir up such a great wave, and that such strong flames of resistance would erupt in an instant. Although the warmongers live in the present, they are always dreaming of the past. If Eisenhower's predecessor, Hitler, could still, with the connivance of the United States, Britain, and France in the late 1930s, after a bout of war frenzy, use force to occupy many small countries in Europe, then today in the 1960s, even if the U.S. and British colonialists go on a war frenzy and use a hundred times more force than Hitler did back then, they still wouldn't be able to occupy that many countries. The reason is simple: today, the East wind prevails over the West wind. If they want to occupy any piece of peaceful and free land, they must pay an extremely high price in blood for every inch of it. Because behind the people of Lebanon and Jordan stand the people of the whole world, stand the powerful socialist camp, which controls weapons that even U.S. generals will not be able to defend against in the future. The Arab people, burning with the flames of national liberation, will never yield to the invaders, and they will surely receive the firmest support from all peace-loving people around the world.
    It is no wonder that the imperialist paper tigers, in this situation of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak and climbing onto a volcano, are dizzy and disoriented all day long like ants on a hot pan. The pot is getting hotter day by day. To escape this embarrassing situation, they have only one option: to unconditionally get out of Lebanon and Jordan. Otherwise, only a scorched death awaits them.

    热锅上的蚂蚁
    伊默
    据英国“每日邮报”上登载的一篇华盛顿电讯说：“艾森豪威尔先生自从下令美国海军陆战队登陆黎巴嫩以来，一直感到忧虑”，“他现在一天又一天地在他的办公室里踱来踱去”，“他坚持要人告诉他最微小的细节。几乎每小时他都像开炮似的向国防部发出指示”。这位总统此时此地的心情，是可以理解的，正像杀人放火的强盗被捕落网后的战栗心情的可以理解一样。
    中国的俗语，总是把那些为了特殊的事变搞得坐卧不宁，寝食不安的人，比喻成“热锅上的蚂蚁”。艾森豪威尔玩火自焚甘冒天下之大不韪，而踏进侵略中东的火坑，岂不正像蚂蚁跌进热锅里那样感到走头无路了吗？
    当然，实际上处于热锅上蚂蚁状态的，何只艾森豪威尔一人？美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊和副部长卡利斯在参议院军备小组委员会作证时说：对于苏联的洲际弹道导弹，美国现在没有，同时在“可以预见的将来”，也没有防御的方法。军备小组委员会主席，民主党参议院领袖约翰逊，指责美国国防部说他们在这个方面，缺乏一种“严重的迫切感”。而国防部的部长们却回答说：谁能证明“缺乏严重的迫切感”呵！“迫切感”是有的，就是从技术上说找不出防御办法来。这不又是焦急之状可掬了吗？其实，那些进行原子讹诈的战争贩子，才是最怕死的胆小鬼。他们整天都是惊魂不定地过活着。他们十分清楚地知道，如果他们敢于发动原子战争，洲际导弹就会落在他们自己的脑袋上。而这正是他们防也防不了的东西。
    艾森豪威尔和他的同伙——一小撮帝国主义的战争贩子，在发动侵略中东的战争行动时，大概没有预料到，为了占领“小小”的黎巴嫩和约旦，为了想恫吓一下中东人民，居然会掀起这样的轩然大波，一时就会迸发出如此强烈的反抗怒火。战争贩子们虽然生活在现在，却总是做着历史的美梦。如果说艾森豪威尔的先辈希特勒，还有可能在二十世纪的三十年代末，在美英法的纵容下面，经过战争狂的发作，用武力占领欧洲的许多小国的话，那么，在二十世纪六十年代的今天，美英殖民主义者即使战争狂大发，用出多于当年希特勒百倍的力气，也是占领不了那样多的国家的。原因很简单，今天是东风压倒了西风。他们想占领任何一块和平自由的土地，就必须在每一寸土地上付出极高的血的代价。因为在黎巴嫩和约旦人民的后面站立着全世界人民，站立着强大的社会主义阵营，这个阵营又掌握着即使在将来美国将军们也无法防御的武器。燃烧着民族解放烈火的阿拉伯人民是决不会向侵略者退让的，而他们一定能得到全世界爱好和平人民的最坚决支持。
    处于这种外强中干而又爬上了火山口的帝国主义纸老虎，整天像热锅上的蚂蚁一样头昏脑胀，是不足为怪的。锅是要一天热过一天的。要想摆脱这种狼狈的处境，只有无条件地滚出黎巴嫩和约旦，不然，只有被烧焦的一条死路在等待着他们。
