Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 24th: The newspapers here published the communique on the implementation of the Soviet national economic plan for the first half of this year. Comparing the materials in the communique with the reports on the production situation of capitalist countries since the beginning of this year, it is clear that in the economic competition in the first half of this year, the Soviet Union once again overwhelmed its main opponent, the United States, and other major capitalist countries.

Since the beginning of this year, the various sectors of the Soviet national economy have continued to develop in a straight line. According to the aforementioned communique issued by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, the total industrial output value plan of the Soviet Union was completed by 104% in the first half of this year. The industrial production plans of all the republics and national economic regions (except for the Sakhalin Economic Region), as well as the transportation plans of all transportation departments in the country, were all completed and overfulfilled. Labor productivity in industry increased by 6% compared with the same period last year, and labor productivity in the construction industry increased by 10%. The total industrial output of the country increased by 10.5% compared with the first half of last year.

However, the United States and almost all other capitalist countries have been in a cyclical economic crisis in the first half of this year. The growth rate of their industrial products has slowed down, and the production volume of many industrial sectors has decreased. For example, in the first four months of this year, US industrial production fell by 14%. Although there was a slight rebound in May and June, it was still lower than the same period last year. West Germany's industrial production in May this year decreased by 0.4% compared with the same period last year.

The communique on the implementation of the Soviet national economic plan stated that, compared with the same period last year, the production of the Soviet Union's metallurgical industry and the fuel and power industry increased by 9% and 10% respectively in the first half of this year. According to materials published in newspapers, during the same period, the production of some important sectors of the aforementioned industries in the United States and some other major capitalist countries either slowed down, stagnated, or reduced production. For example, in the first six months of this year, the output of cast steel and steel ingots in the United States decreased by more than 20 million tons compared with the same period last year; the steel output in the United Kingdom decreased by 5.4%, and the coal output decreased by approximately 5 million tons; the output of pig iron in West Germany decreased by hundreds of thousands of tons compared with the same period last year, while the steel output remained almost at the same level as the same period last year. In the first half of this year, the production of the Soviet Union's building materials industry increased by 26% compared with the same period last year, and the production of the machine manufacturing and metal processing industry increased by 14%. The production of metal processing equipment in the United States decreased by more than 50% in the first quarter.

The aforementioned communique stated that in the first half of this year, the Soviet Union produced a total of 19.3 million tons of pig iron, 27 million tons of steel, 21.3 million tons of steel products, 245 million tons of coal, 54 million tons of oil, 114 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 15.9 million tons of cement, and 2.9 billion meters of cotton fabrics. John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, admitted in early May this year that the Soviet Union would surpass the United States in total coal production for the first time this year.

Here is another strong contrast: Since the beginning of this year, corporate investment in the United States and several other capitalist countries has been cut, and existing enterprises are operating under capacity. However, in the first half of this year, many new production capacities in various sectors of the Soviet national economy were put into production. Compared with the first half of last year, investment in capital construction in the steel industry increased by 28%, the oil and gas industry increased by 22%, the machine manufacturing industry increased by 10%, the chemical industry increased by 27%, and the light industry and food industry increased by 23%.

The communique of the Soviet Central Statistical Bureau pointed out that the Soviet Union's agricultural production has also achieved new development. This year, the total sown area of various crops that can be harvested throughout the Soviet Union reached more than 195 million hectares, more than 1.5 million hectares more than last year. According to the growth of crops, this year the Soviet agriculture is expected to have a bumper harvest. Especially in Siberia, Kazakhstan, the Volga River basin and other major grain-producing areas, as well as in the North Caucasus, Ukraine and many other regions.

In terms of animal husbandry, compared with July 1 last year, the number of cattle, sheep and pigs in collective farms and state farms across the country increased by more than 16 million. The state's plan for purchasing and acquiring livestock products was greatly overfulfilled.

With the development of various sectors of the national economy, the number of Soviet employees in the first half of this year increased by one million compared with the first half of last year. According to reports in the bourgeois press, in June this year, the number of unemployed people in the United States increased by 2.1 million compared with the same period last year, and the number of unemployed people in the United Kingdom, West Germany, Japan and other countries also increased.

The aforementioned communique pointed out that in the first half of this year, the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people have been further improved. More and more industrial employees have their working days shortened to six and seven hours. In the past six months, Soviet residents received more subsidies, social insurance funds, preferential treatment funds and other allowances, more than 6% more than in the first half of last year. The daily necessities sold to residents by state-owned commercial and cooperative businesses have increased. The state built more than 2 million square meters of housing for residents than in the same period last year.

### 在今年上半年的经济竞赛中又获胜利  苏联经济发展进一步压倒美国

    在今年上半年的经济竞赛中又获胜利
    苏联经济发展进一步压倒美国
    据新华社莫斯科24日电　此间各报发表了今年上半年苏联国民经济计划执行情况的公报。把公报中的材料同报刊上发表的关于资本主义国家今年以来的生产情况对照一下，可以明显地看出，在今年上半年的经济竞赛中，苏联再一次压倒了它的主要对手美国和其他主要资本主义国家。
    今年以来，苏联国民经济各部门继续直线发展。根据苏联部长会议中央统计局发表的上述公报，今年上半年，苏联工业总产值计划完成了104％，各加盟共和国和各国民经济区（库页岛经济区除外）的工业生产计划，以及全国各运输部门的运输计划都完成和超额完成了。工业中的劳动生产率比去年同时期提高了6％，建筑业中的劳动生产率提高了10％。全国工业总产量比去年上半年增加了10.5％。
    然而，美国和几乎其他所有资本主义国家今年上半年却处在周期性的经济危机中。它们的工业产品增长速度减慢了，许多工业部门的生产量减少了。例如，在今年头四个月中，美国工业生产下降了14％，今年5、6月虽然有少许回升，但仍比去年同期低。西德今年5月份工业生产比去年同期减少了0.4％。
    苏联国民经济计划执行情况的公报说，和去年同期比较，今年上半年苏联冶金工业、燃料和动力工业的生产分别增加了9％和10％。根据报刊发表的材料，在同一时期内，美国和其他一些主要资本主义国家的上述工业的一些重要部门的生产或者减慢了速度，或者停滞不前，或者缩减了产量。例如，今年头六个月美国的铸钢和钢锭产量就比去年同期减少了两千多万吨；英国的钢产量下降了5.4％，煤产量大约减少了五百多万吨；西德的生铁比去年同期减少了几十万吨，钢产量则差不多维持在去年同期原来的水平上。今年上半年，苏联的建筑材料工业的生产比去年同期增加了26％，机器制造和金属加工工业的生产增加了14％。美国金属加工装备的生产在第一季度中减少了50％以上。
    上述公报说，今年上半年苏联总共生产了一千九百三十万吨生铁、二千七百万吨钢、二千一百三十万吨钢材、二亿四千五百万吨煤、五千四百万吨石油、一千一百四十亿度电、一千五百九十万吨水泥、二十九亿公尺棉织品。美国联合煤矿工会主席刘易斯在今年5月初承认，苏联今年将第一次在煤的总产量方面超过美国。
    下面又是一个强烈的对比：今年以来，美国和其他若干资本主义国家的企业投资都削减了，而且现有企业都开工不足。但在今年上半年，苏联国民经济各部门又有许多新的生产能力投入生产，和去年上半年比较，钢铁工业基本建设投资增加了28％，石油和瓦斯工业增加了22％，机器制造工业增加了10％，化学工业增加了27％，轻工业和食品工业增加了23％。
    苏联中央统计局的公报指出，苏联的农业生产也获得了新的发展。今年，总计全苏联可以收获的各种农作物的播种面积达一亿九千五百多万公顷，比去年多一百五十多万公顷。根据农作物成长的情况看来，今年苏联农业可望丰收。特别是在西伯利亚、哈萨克、伏尔加河流域等主要产谷区，以及在北高加索、乌克兰和很多其他地区。
    在畜牧业方面，同去年7月1日相比，全国集体农庄和国营农场的牛、羊和猪增加了一千六百多万头。国家采购和收购畜产品的计划大大超额完成了。
    随着国民经济各部门的发展，今年上半年苏联职工人数比去年上半年增加了一百万人。据资产阶级报刊报道，今年6月间，美国失业人数就比去年同期增加了二百一十万人，英国、西德、日本等国的失业人数也增加了。
    前面所说的公报指出，今年上半年，苏联人民的物质和文化生活水平又有了进一步的提高。工业中有越来越多的职工的工作日缩短到六小时和七小时。在过去的半年内，苏联居民得到的补助金、社会保险金、优抚金和其他津贴比去年上半年多6％以上。国营商业和合作社商业出售给居民的日用品增加了。国家为居民建造的住宅比去年同期多两百多万平方公尺。
