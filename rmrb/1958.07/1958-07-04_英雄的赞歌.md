    Ode to Heroes
    Zhong Xiu

    The inaugural issue of "Red Flag" magazine published a folk song from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region entitled "Real Heroes Look to Today."

    This folk song is short, but it profoundly reveals the true face of our great era and vividly reflects the revolutionary style of our heroic people.

    Listen: "If you say what is the greatest, the sky is the greatest, our vigor soars to the sky; If you say who is the most capable, the gods are the most capable, our intelligence surpasses the immortals; Heroes of the past have become history, real heroes look to today." What a grand spirit! The broad masses of working people have been liberated from slavery and have become the true masters of nature. Filled with a strong sense of pride, they no longer blindly believe in nature or divine power, but deeply believe that they can overcome all difficulties, conquer nature, transform the world, and dare to declare a break with all old ideas and inherited forces.

    Things always develop in comparison and struggle. The three clauses of this folk song hide three comparisons. The magnitude of vigor is compared to the sky; the magnitude of wisdom is compared to the gods; the magnitude of achievement is compared to all the heroes and outstanding figures in history. It is truly "counting the outstanding figures, we still look to today." These three comparisons are the self-declaration of heroes, fully expressing their noble style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. This new style is precisely what the new relations of production require.

    英雄的赞歌
    锺秀
    “红旗”杂志的创刊号上，刊载了广西僮族自治区的一首民歌，题目叫做“真正英雄看今天”。
    这首民歌很短，但它深刻地揭示了我们这个伟大时代的真实面貌，生动地反映了我们这些英雄人民的革命风格。
    听吧：“要说大来天最大，我们干劲要冲天；要说能来神最能，我们智能赛神仙；历代豪杰成过去，真正英雄看今天。”这是多么宏大的气魄啊！广大的劳动人民，已经从奴隶状态中解放出来，成为自然界的真正的主人了。他们怀着一种强烈的自豪感，不再迷信自然、迷信神力，而深信自己能够排除万难、征服自然、改造世界，敢于同一切陈旧观念和因袭势力宣告决裂。
    事物总是在比较和斗争中发展的。这首民歌的三个分句，隐藏着三个“比”字。干劲之大，跟天比；智慧之大，跟神比；成就之大，跟历史上的一切英雄豪杰比，真个是“数风流人物，还看今朝”。这三个“比”，就是英雄的自白。充分表现了他们的敢想、敢说、敢做的崇高风格。这种新风格，正是新的生产关系所要求的。
