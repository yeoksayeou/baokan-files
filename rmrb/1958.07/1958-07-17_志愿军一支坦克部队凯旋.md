    志愿军一支坦克部队凯旋
    新华社安东16日电　中国人民志愿军第二批归国部队的一支强大坦克部队，今天凯旋归来。英雄的坦克手们，在祖国人民捐献的这些坦克身上，披上了彩色纸带和鲜花，还涂上了耀眼的红五星，标志着他们在朝鲜战场上，配合步兵英勇作战中创造了击毁、击伤敌人七十多辆坦克，使美国侵略军的“坦克劈入战”惨遭失败的光辉战绩。
    安东市各界人民热烈欢迎了这支英雄部队的归来。在安东车站上，锣鼓喧天，人们纷纷迎向车厢，把英雄们抬起来又放下去。八十岁的何老太太拉着战士们的手，要求到她家去坐一坐、喝口水，以表达母亲的心意。
    与此同时，英雄的坦克手们还和安东市各界人民代表进行了座谈。“二一五”号功劳坦克的战士们，向祖国亲人报告了他们英勇击毁敌人七辆坦克的战斗事迹。兴隆街小学的学生纪有方，把自己心爱的红领巾献给了二等功臣杨清川大尉，表示对英雄叔叔的崇高敬意。
