Column: Downward-sent Cadres Dedicate Technology and Culture to the Countryside!

    After They Came
    Chen Wanshun, Secretary of the Communist Party Branch in Jialanban Village, Inner Mongolia
    Our village used to be a village lacking culture and not very hygienic. But this year, the situation in the village has changed drastically. Not only are the masses full of production enthusiasm, but every evening the people's school is filled with the sound of reading.
    Why has our village's appearance been renewed so quickly?
    Here's the story. On January 27th of this year, nine cadres from the Hohhot Civil Affairs Bureau were sent down to our village. At that time, the government called for accumulating fertilizer, and we also found a source of fertilizer: digging the mud from smelly water pits. At that time, it was cold and the ground was frozen, and we couldn't mobilize people no matter what. Some farmers said, "Who does that in the last month of the year? In the past, we didn't fertilize the fields, and we still ate wheat." After the downward-sent cadres came to our village, as soon as they heard about this situation, they took hoes and baskets the next day and went to dig and carry fertilizer. A few days later, the number of people accumulating fertilizer increased to more than 300, and even women with bound feet and children in their teens were out carrying baskets. In less than a month, more than 18,000 cartloads of fertilizer were accumulated, exceeding the fertilizer accumulation plan by 15%.
    In March, there was a great leap forward in literacy work. Several downward-sent cadres, after two nights of hard work, enrolled all the illiterates and forty school-age children in the village. They shared all the teaching tasks. Comrade Gao Ping even voluntarily lent 30 yuan to solve the problem of students buying books. Now all the students are very motivated and determined to get rid of their illiteracy before "August 1st" (Army Day).

专栏：下放干部们把技术和文化献给农村！

    他们来了以后中
    共内蒙古甲兰板村支部书记　陈万顺
    我们村过去是个缺文化、不太讲卫生的村子。可是今年村子里的情况大变了，群众不但生产干劲十足，每天傍晚民校还是一片读书声。
    为什么我们村的面貌很快就能焕然一新呢？
    是这么一回事。今年1月27日，呼和浩特市民政局的九位干部下放到我们村里来了。当时政府号召积肥，我们也找到了肥源：刨臭水坑里的泥土。当时天又冷，地又冻，怎么也动员不出人来。有些农民说：“大年腊月谁干那个，过去地里不上粪，一样吃麦子。”下放干部到我们村里后，一听到这一情况，第二天就拿上镐头、筐子，去刨肥担肥。几天以后，积肥的人数就增加到三百多名，连小脚妇女和十来岁的娃娃也背着箩头出动了。不到一个月，便积下一万八千多车肥料，超额完成积肥计划15％。
    3月间，扫盲工作大跃进，几位下放干部，经过两夜苦战，使全村文盲和四十名学龄儿童都入了学。教学任务全由他们分担，高平同志还主动借出三十元，解决了学员买书的困难。现在全体学员劲头很足，决心要在“八一”前摘掉文盲帽子。
