    Oil and Aggression
    Soviet Union, Ge Milisiji
    "Our mobile forces should be able to cope with the possibility of limited warfare (from small-scale police actions to conflicts involving several countries)."
    This is a sentence from the Rockefeller Foundation report published on January 6 this year. Under the personal leadership of Nelson Rockefeller, a group of American tycoons spent eighteen months drafting this 25,000-word report. The press gave this report a name, called "Rockefellerism."
    The report does not mention Near Eastern countries, nor does it mention the word "East" at all. The drafters of this report are generally straightforward, but they are still careful not to be too explicit, not to directly state that "limited war" is a tool for suppressing national liberation movements. Their recommendations were explained by the U.S. State Department. The Sixth Fleet's cannons provided a good annotation to the ambiguous language used by the authors of "Rockefellerism." American troops landed in Lebanon under the cover of the Sixth Fleet.
    I
    The French magazine "Perspectives" once called Dulles "the high priest of the oil religion." No American Secretary of State has spent so much effort in the Near East region; the American oil tycoons regard this region as their hereditary territory, as the richest source of inexhaustible profits.
    Nature seems to compensate for the vast waterless deserts and sun-scorched grasslands by endowing the Persian Gulf region with mythical oil treasures. The current annual oil production in this region reaches 200 million tons. This means that the Near East region ranks second in the world in terms of oil production. However, just twenty years ago, the Near East's oil production did not exceed 16 million tons. This huge leap makes it understandable why American oil monopolies are showing an increasingly strong interest in the Near East. It should be known that, after forty years of continuous and tenacious offensives, they seized the dominant position in the Middle East oil business from the British monopoly capital that previously dominated this region. Now, the proportion of oil production in this region accounted for by Britain has dropped to 30%, while the American share has reached 65%.
    Twenty-two American oil companies have interests in Near Eastern oil. Among them, Rockefeller's "Mobil Oil Company" (New Jersey and California) ranks first. Currently, American oil monopolies' investment in the Near East has exceeded $1.7 billion. Their net profit (after deducting royalties) is more than $1 billion annually. No other region on earth can find such a high rate of return. The Near East is a paradise for oil monopolies. Its mythical profits depend on the extremely low cost of Near Eastern oil. According to the calculations of Soviet economist A. Santalov, the cost of oil production in the Persian Gulf region is only one-thirteenth or even one-sixteenth of the cost of oil production in the United States. No wonder the profits of American monopolies sometimes reach as high as 400%!
    To protect this unique source of income, oil monopolies are capable of any crime.
    II
    In the early post-war period, the United States had not yet gained a solid foothold in the Near East. This region was controlled by the British Empire.
    The United States began to infiltrate the Near East from Europe. The Truman Doctrine was announced in 1947, which established American control over Germany and Turkey. This was a stepping stone into the oil-producing Near East countries. It was not without reason that newspapers at the time said that Truman stood on an oil barrel when he announced his doctrine.
    In 1951, when the United States, along with Britain, France, and Turkey, attempted to drag Arab countries into the "Middle East Command" in order to occupy the entire Near East and turn it into an imperialist political and military bridgehead, Rockefeller's face in the Near East was exposed more clearly. The goal pursued by Washington was to gain a foothold in the Near East, even if it meant sharing the spoils equally with Britain at the beginning. The people of the Arab countries overthrew this colonialist plan. However, the Rockefeller elements were not discouraged.
    It is not difficult to see that the United States' policy towards the Near East has been constantly strengthened with the growth of oil production in this region. The following figures illustrate the oil production of the two countries most closely related to American monopolies. One is Saudi Arabia, where the oil is 100% owned by American monopolies; the other is Kuwait, where half of the oil is controlled by American capital (the remainder is exploited by British companies).
                           Oil Production (in millions of tons)
           1944  1946  1948  1950  1952  1954  1955  1956
Saudi Arabia 1.0   8.2   19.0   26.6   40.3   46.4   47.0   48.6
Kuwait      —   0.8   6.4   17.2   37.6   47.7   54.7   55
    It must be pointed out that it was during these years that the Arab peoples launched a surging liberation movement, impacting the cornerstone of Britain's colonial fortress in the Near East and further endangering the interests of Rockefeller's oil empire. The relentless course of history made the oil tycoons uneasy, forcing them to panic.
    The United States pretended not to align itself with its allies (Britain and France), with the aim of defrauding the Arab people of political capital and using a borrowed knife to eliminate the Arab national liberation movement. Shortly after the Suez incident, the United States proposed the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine." This was a new, more aggressive stage in Washington's policy towards the Near East. Taking advantage of the time when Britain's influence in the Arab world plummeted, the United States proclaimed itself the sole "protector" of the Near East from a non-existent "Soviet threat." The authors of this "doctrine" took unilateral action, bypassing the United Nations, and劃divided an entire region of the world into the so-called "American defense circle" (actually a sphere of influence controlled by American imperialism). They reserved for themselves the right to decide on situations that could provide them with a basis for armed intervention. At the same time, the term "Near East" was also interpreted in a very broad sense. The "New York Times" wrote that the State Department included North Africa, Ethiopia, the Belgian Congo, Kenya, and other African countries in the "broadly defined" Near East. The American magazine "Monthly Review" said: "The Eisenhower Doctrine is to establish a huge Asian-African empire."
    At the same time, the Eisenhower Doctrine itself also contained the elements of playing two-sided tricks and disguises as before. This doctrine tried to divide the Arab world, isolate Egypt and Syria, which opposed imperialism, and strengthen the reactionary feudal monarchies in the Arab world. At the same time, it also attempted to buy off the national bourgeoisie, exert economic pressure, and take intimidation measures.
    The events in Jordan and Syria in 1957 showed the people of all countries the essence of the American colonialist plan. This plan was related to the aggressive Baghdad Pact. Its purpose was to maintain the regimes of those "oil" kings and sheikhs (which are actually the regimes of the Rockefeller and Mellon consortia), to prevent the cause of the Arab people's struggle for liberation and unity from achieving victory, to keep the fragmented Arab world under American control, and to turn the entire Near East into a large colonialist restricted area exclusively for American monopolies.
    By the end of 1957, the failure of the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine" was a foregone conclusion. Just at this time, a report known as "Rockefellerism" was published.
    III
    "Local wars," "limited wars," these are Dulles's old tunes. But in the past, people believed that these types of wars would be carried out by America's allies, while American imperialism could use others to "subdue" those disobedient countries. The Suez adventure showed that this calculation was unreliable. Therefore, the Rockefeller report openly suggested to the American government: "It is necessary to... establish troops capable of rapid intervention...". In addition, the authors of this new "doctrine" suggested, with a coldness and wickedness no less than that of the executioners of the Auschwitz concentration camp, to establish special forces to conduct "limited atomic warfare" (!). This can be said to be "one step further" compared to the Eisenhower Doctrine. It suggested the direct use of American troops equipped with atomic weapons to suppress the national liberation movements of various countries, because otherwise, what "local war" could there be to talk about? The Rockefeller elements wanted to use atomic bombs to scare those who were unwilling to be enslaved by American colonialism. They demanded the large-scale slaughter of people in order to ensure their super-profits.
    The current aggression against the Arab Eastern countries launched by the American ruling group belongs to the scope of "Rockefellerism." The drafters of the Rockefeller report even gave a "theoretical definition" to limited war. In their words, the most distinctive feature of this limited war is that America's "national survival" does not depend on the outcome of this war. Indeed, even those accustomed to fantasy would find it difficult to imagine that the conflict in Lebanon would in some way affect America's national survival or the national interests of the entire United States. This Arab country itself does not arouse as much interest in American oil monopolies as Saudi Arabia. Lebanon does not produce oil; it is only through this country that oil is transported out. The American warmongers want to use military demonstrations to intimidate the people of other countries in the Near East, because they might dare to infringe on the interests of "Mobil Oil Company" or "Gulf Oil Company." The purpose of the current aggression is to "punish" and "teach a lesson" to those Arabs who desire independence, and to suppress the patriotic forces in the Arab world. As the drafters of the Rockefeller report said, this is a "small-scale police action."
    In order to take this kind of action, the advocates of the new "doctrine" demanded the establishment of "sea bridges" and "air bridges." This argument was also realized in Lebanon (landing with the help of the "sea bridge") and Jordan (the British "air bridge"). Even in some details, Rockefeller and his associates made suggestions to the American government and military authorities, and these suggestions are being implemented.
    The aggression against Lebanon is, in fact, the realization of Dulles's proposition on the "brinkmanship policy." The colonialists' intervention actually leads to the threat of a new world war. American imperialists sinfully and irresponsibly play with the fate of the people, thus thoroughly exposing themselves in front of the whole world.
    In this sense, it can be said that the new third stage of the United States' policy towards the Near East marks a complete failure of Washington's past Eastern policy. In this new stage, the bankrupt "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine" and its attempts to adopt circuitous methods and disguises have been replaced by the open aggression of "Rockefellerism." Lippmann confessed that "we are now using force to confront the Arab revolution." The United States is actually openly attacking all the Eastern countries striving for independence with the old colonialist "big stick" policy, in the manner of the Suez invasion. The logic of imperialism prompts Washington to support the anti-people traitorous groups that maintain the interests of the monopoly groups. From now on, these decadent and doomed systems will become America's only pillars in the East.
    The Rockefeller elements and those who carry out their will are carrying out open imperialist plunder in front of the people of all countries. This is a typical manifestation of a mad and doomed power policy. This is playing with fire, and it has gone too far. The freedom-loving people of all countries must never tolerate this playing with fire.

    石油和侵略
    苏联　格·密尔斯基
    “我们的机动部队应当能够应付可能发生的有限战争的情况（从小规模的警察行动起直到有数国参加的冲突止）。”
    这是今年1月6日发表的洛克菲勒基金会的报告中的一句话。在纳尔逊·洛克菲勒亲自领导下，一批美国大商人花了十八个月的工夫拟就了这份长达二万五千言的报告。报界给这份报告起了个名字，叫做“洛克菲勒主义”。
    这个报告没有提到近东国家，也根本没有提到东方的字样。这份报告的起草人，一般说来是直言不讳的，但还是小心谨慎不愿把话说得太露骨，不直截了当地言明“有限战争”就是镇压民族解放运动的工具。他们的建议由美国国务院说明了。第六舰队的大炮，给“洛克菲勒主义”作者所使用的暧昧说法作了很好的注解。美国军队在第六舰队的掩护下在黎巴嫩登陆了。
    一
    法国的“展望”杂志有一次把杜勒斯叫做“石油宗教的大祭司”。没有任何一个美国国务卿像他这样在近东这个地区花费了那末多的工夫；美国的石油大王把这个地区看成是自己的世袭领地，看成是最丰富的取之不尽的利润的源泉。
    大自然好像是要给那茫茫无水的沙漠和炎日烤灼的草原以补偿，赋予波斯湾地区以神话般的石油宝藏。现在这个地区的石油年产量达到两亿吨。这就是说，在石油产量方面，近东地区占世界第二位。然而，不过二十年以前，近东石油的产量没有超过一千六百万吨。这一个巨大的飞跃，使人们可以理解为什么美国石油垄断巨头们对近东表示日益强烈的兴趣。要知道，他们经过四十年不断的顽强进攻，从以前在这个地区称霸的英国垄断资本手里夺取了中东石油生意的支配地位。现在，在这个地区的石油产量中英国所占比重已降到30％了，而美国的份额竟达到了65％。
    二十二个美国石油公司同近东的石油有利害关系。其中洛克菲勒的“美孚油公司”（新泽西和加里福尼亚）占第一位。目前，美国石油垄断资本对近东的投资已超过十七亿美元。它们的纯利（扣除租借费用）每年达十亿美元以上。地球上任何一个地区也找不到这样高的利润率。近东是石油垄断资本的天堂。它那神话般的利润，取决于极端低廉的近东石油的成本。据苏联经济学家阿·桑塔洛夫的计算，波斯湾地区的石油生产费用只有美国石油生产费用的十三分之一甚至十六分之一。无怪，有时美国垄断资本的利润竟高达百分之四百！
    石油垄断资本为了保护这种绝无仅有的收入的来源，是什么罪行都干得出来的。
    二
    战后初期美国在近东还没占有一点巩固的阵地。这个地区曾为大英帝国所控制。
    美国开始从欧洲向近东渗入。1947年宣布了杜鲁门主义，这个主义确立了美国对德国和土耳其的控制权。这是进入生产石油的近东国家的敲门砖。当时的报纸上说杜鲁门站在石油桶上宣布了自己的主义，并不是没有道理的。
    1951年当美国和英、法、土耳其一道企图把阿拉伯国家拖入“中东司令部”，以便占领整个近东地区，把它变为帝国主义的政治和军事的桥头堡时，洛克菲勒在近东的面目就暴露得比较清楚了。华盛顿所追求的目的，就是要插足近东，哪怕一开始时和英国平分秋色也好。阿拉伯各国人民推翻了这个殖民主义的计划。但是，洛克菲勒分子并没有灰心。
    不难看出，美国对近东的政策是随着这个地区石油生产的增长而不断加强的。下面的一些数字可以说明同美国垄断资本关系最重要的两个国家的石油生产情况。一个是沙特阿拉伯，这里的石油百分之百属于美国垄断资本；另一个是科威特，这里一半的石油属于美国资本控制（其余部分归英国公司开采）。
                            石油产量　（单位百万吨）
            1944年　1946年　1948年　1950年　1952年　1954年　1955年　1956年沙特阿拉伯　1.0    　8.2　   19.0　  26.6  　40.3  　46.4  　47.0　  48.6科威特       —    　0.8   　6.4   　17.2  　37.6    47.7    54.7　  55
    必须指出，就是在这些年月里，阿拉伯各国人民掀起了汹涌澎湃的解放运动，冲击着英国在近东的殖民堡垒的基石，并且进一步危及洛克菲勒石油帝国的利益。无情的历史进程，弄得石油大王们惶惶不安，迫使他们慌张起来。
    美国在表面上不同自己的盟国（英国和法国）为伍，其目的是要在阿拉伯人面前骗取政治资本，并借刀杀人来消灭阿拉伯的民族解放运动。美国在苏伊士事件发生后不久，就提出了“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”。这是华盛顿对近东政策的一个新的、更富有侵略性的阶段。趁着英国在阿拉伯世界的影响一落千丈的时机，美国自封它是使近东免于根本不存在的“苏联威胁”的独一无二的“保卫者”。这个“主义”的作者们，采取片面的行动，越过联合国，把世界上整整一大片地区划入所谓“美国的防卫圈”（实际上是美帝国主义控制的势力范围）。他们为自己保留了有决定可以为他们提供武装干涉根据的那种情况的权利。同时，“近东”这一术语，也被作了极广义的解释。“纽约时报”曾写道，国务院把北非、埃塞俄比亚、比属刚果、怯尼亚以及其他非洲国家都列入“广义的”近东范围。美国的“每月评论”杂志曾说：“艾森豪威尔主义就是要建立一个巨大的亚非帝国”。
    同时，艾森豪威尔主义本身也含有以前那种玩弄两面手法和进行伪装的因素。这个主义竭力分化阿拉伯世界，孤立埃及和叙利亚这些反对帝国主义的国家，以及加强阿拉伯世界的反动封建君主集团。与此同时，它还企图收买民族资产阶级，施加经济压力和采取恫吓手段。
    1957年的约旦和叙利亚事件向各国人民表明了美国殖民主义计划的实质。这个计划同富有侵略性的巴格达条约有关。它的目的是：维护那些“石油”国王和酋长的政权（这实际上就是洛克菲勒和梅隆财团的政权），不许阿拉伯人民争取解放和团结的事业取得胜利，使四分五裂的阿拉伯世界处于美国控制之下，并把整个近东变成专属美国垄断资本的一大殖民主义禁区。
    到1957年底，“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”的失败，已成定局。正当这个时候，一个以“洛克菲勒主义”闻名的报告问世了。
    三
    “局部战争”，“有限战争”，这些都是杜勒斯的老调。但是从前人们认为这类战争将由美国的盟国来进行，而美帝国主义则可以假他人之手来使那些不驯服的国家“就范”。苏伊士的冒险事件表明，这种打算是不可靠的。因此在洛克菲勒的报告中曾公开向美国政府建议道：“必须……建立能够迅速进行干涉的军队……。”此外，这个新“主义”的作者们以一种不亚于奥斯威辛集中营刽子手们的冷酷和邪恶，毫不客气地建议，建立特种部队来进行“有限的原子战争”（！）。这同艾森豪威尔主义相比可以说是“更进了一步”。它建议直接使用配备原子武器的美国军队来镇压各国人民的民族解放运动，因为否则又有什么“局部战争”可谈呢？洛克菲勒分子想用原子弹来吓唬那些不愿受美国殖民主义奴役的人。他们为了确保自己的超额利润而要求大规模地屠杀人民。
    目前美国统治集团所发动的对阿拉伯东方国家的侵略，是属于“洛克菲勒主义”范围内的东西。洛克菲勒报告的起草人甚至给有限战争下了“理论的定义”。用他们的话来说，这种有限战争的最大特点是，美国的“国家生存”不取决于这种战争的结局。的确，即使惯于异想天开的人也很难想像得出，在黎巴嫩所发生的冲突会在某种程度上影响美国的国家生存，或者整个美国的国家利益。这个阿拉伯国家本身自然并不像沙特阿拉伯那样引起美国石油垄断资本那么大的兴趣。黎巴嫩并不产石油，只是石油经过这个国家运出去而已。美国的黩武主义者想用军事示威来恫吓近东其他国家的人民，因为他们可能敢于侵犯“美孚油公司”或“海湾石油公司”的利益。目前的侵略行为的目的，就是要“惩罚”和“教训”那些渴望独立的阿拉伯人，镇压阿拉伯世界的爱国力量。正像洛克菲勒的报告的起草人所说的，这是一种“小规模的警察行动”。
    为了采取这一类的行动，新“主义”的倡议者们要求建立“海上桥梁”和“空中桥梁”。这个论点也在黎巴嫩（在“海上桥梁”帮助下登陆）和约旦（英国的“空中桥梁”）实现了。甚至在一些细节上，洛克菲勒及其同伙，都向美国政府和军事领导当局提出了建议，而这些建议正在执行中。
    对黎巴嫩的侵略，实际上也是实现了杜勒斯关于“战争边缘政策”的主张。殖民者的干涉实际上导向新的世界大战的威胁。美帝国主义者罪恶地不负责任地玩弄人民的命运，因而在全世界面前彻底揭露了自己。
    在这个意义上可以说，美国对近东政策的新的第三阶段，标志着华盛顿过去的东方政策的一败涂地。在这个新阶段中，破了产的“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”及其采取迂回手法和伪装的企图，被“洛克菲勒主义”的公开侵略所代替了。李普曼供认说，“我们现在借助于武力同阿拉伯的革命相对抗”。美国实际上是在公开地、以旧殖民主义的“大棒”政策，以苏伊士侵略活动的方式，向所有争取独立的东方各国人民进攻。帝国主义的逻辑促使华盛顿去支持那维护垄断集团利益的反人民的卖国集团。今后，这些腐朽的、必然要灭亡的制度，就成为美国在东方的唯一支柱了。
    洛克菲勒分子和执行他们意志的人，在各国人民面前实行公开的帝国主义掠夺。这是疯狂的、注定要破产的实力政策的典型表现。这是一种玩火行为，而且玩得太过份了。爱好自由的各国人民绝不能容忍这种玩火行为。
