    Merely Stupidity
    Recently, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund Committee in the United States submitted a special research report to Washington, estimating the future economic development speed of the Soviet Union to increase by 6% annually, and estimating China's future economic development speed to increase by 2% annually.

    Such a research report can truly be described as utterly absurd. It seems that the researchers of this committee never read, or are unwilling to read, the economic communiqués issued by China and the Soviet Union. Leaving aside their nonsensical estimates of the Soviet Union's economic development speed, taking our country as an example, who doesn't know that the growth rate of our industrial and agricultural output is no longer a few percent, but more than ten percent annually. However, the researchers of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund Committee disregard this fact and insist on concocting such a ridiculous research report, which shows that these imperialist elements do not believe that the Chinese people can accomplish unprecedented things.

    Let the imperialists rest assured. Regardless of whether the imperialists believe it or not, the Chinese people will, with soaring enthusiasm, surpass all imperialist countries in economic development in the shortest possible time. The blindness of the imperialists is merely a manifestation of their stupidity.

    Let Them Howl
    The "embargo" policy that the United States insists on against socialist countries can be said to have no effect on us, China. On the contrary, it has caused no small harm to the "free world," which is currently in the throes of an economic crisis, and more and more people in Western countries are recognizing this. Recently, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson admitted that the United States is facing tremendous "pressure" from its "allies" demanding the "lifting of trade restrictions," but he still believes it is necessary to continue this foolish trick, as if this could really limit the development of socialist countries.

    Socialist countries are developing by leaps and bounds. Taking our country, China, as an example, we have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain, and the steel industry is blooming everywhere. Now, the first atomic reactor has been successfully built with the assistance of the Soviet Union. No force can stop the magnificent Great Leap Forward of our socialist countries. An Eastern proverb says it well: "The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on." Let the likes of Robertson continue to clamor about their so-called "embargo"!

    札记
    不过是愚蠢
    最近，美国洛克菲勒兄弟基金委员会向华盛顿提出了一项特别研究报告，把苏联未来的经济发展速度估计为每年增加6％，把我国未来经济发展速度估计为每年增加2％。
    这样的研究报告真可说是荒唐透顶了。看来，这个委员会的研究人员是从来不看、或者不愿看中苏两国发表的经济公报的。撇开他们对苏联经济发展速度的不成话的估计不谈，就以我国而论，谁不知道我们的工农业产值每年增长的速度已不是百分之几，而是百分之十几。可是，洛克菲勒兄弟基金委员会的研究人员不顾这种事实，而硬要编造那种荒唐可笑的研究报告，这表明这些帝国主义分子不相信中国人民能干出史无前例的事情。
    让帝国主义者心安理得去吧。不管帝国主义者相信不相信，中国人民都会以冲天的干劲，在最短的期间内在经济发展上超过一切帝国主义国家。帝国主义者的盲目，不过是他们愚蠢的表现而已。
    尽管叫吧
    美国所坚持的对社会主义国家的“禁运”政策，对于我们中国来说，可以说是毫无作用，倒是使正在大闹经济危机的“自由世界”受害不浅，西方国家中也有越来越多的人认识到这一点了。最近，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊承认，美国正面临来自它的“盟国”的要求“取消贸易限制”的巨大的“压力”，但是他仍然认为有必要继续把这种愚蠢的把戏搞下去，仿佛这样真的能限制社会主义国家的发展似的。
    社会主义国家都正在飞跃发展。以我们中国为例，粮食空前大丰收，钢铁工业遍地开花，现在，第一座原子反应堆在苏联的援助下已建造成功了。没有什么力量能够阻止我们社会主义国家这种气魄雄伟的大跃进的。东方有句谚语说得好：“狗尽管叫，骆驼队还是向前走”。让罗伯逊之流继续去叫嚷它的什么“禁运”吧！
