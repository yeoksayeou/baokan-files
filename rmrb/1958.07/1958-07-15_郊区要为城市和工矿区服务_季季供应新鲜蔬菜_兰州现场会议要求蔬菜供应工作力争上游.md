Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 14th. The on-site vegetable conference jointly convened in Lanzhou by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Second Ministry of Commerce has resolved the issue of striving for the best in vegetable supply work in cities, new and old industrial and mining areas, and construction sites in the northwestern provinces and regions, and Shanxi Province.

The Northwest region has many emerging industrial areas with rapid industrial development and a rapid population growth. However, in recent years, the vegetable supply in these areas has not kept pace, and the winter and spring seasons are particularly tense. The reasons for the insufficient vegetable supply are, first, the failure to attach importance to implementing the principle of suburban areas serving cities and industrial and mining areas, resulting in a small planting area, small quantity, and limited varieties. In some areas, prices are also high. Second, commercial departments have not sufficiently implemented the policy of supporting production and serving production. The relationship between production and sales is simply a buying and selling relationship, without establishing a cooperative relationship of mutual support. In terms of business management, there are capitalist business ideas, with more consideration for enterprises and less for producers and consumers.

In order to solve the above problems, more than one hundred responsible persons from agriculture and commerce departments, as well as farmers and agricultural scientific and technical personnel attending the conference, conducted on-site visits and exchanged experiences in Lanzhou. The suburbs of Lanzhou have created high-yield vegetable production experiences. For example, the tomatoes planted this spring by the Matan Vegetable Production Cooperative in the Qilihe District currently have seven or eight layers of tomatoes growing on each plant, with an estimated yield of over 70,000 catties per mu. The eggplants and leeks of the Xianfeng Vegetable Cooperative in the Anning District are expected to yield 50,000 catties and 20,000 catties per mu, respectively. Everyone also visited the Si Ji Qing Cooperative in the Xigu District to learn about the use of waste-gas greenhouses to produce vegetables. After the visits, representatives from Xi'an and other places also introduced their respective vegetable production experiences. During discussions and research, the common high-yield experiences were: 1. Close planting; 2. Using covering to prevent frost and freezing; 3. Yangqi cultivation; 4. Utilizing waste-gas greenhouses; 5. Building high trellises; 6. Utilizing plant growth hormones. In addition to vigorously increasing the yield per unit area, it is also necessary to expand the vegetable planting area.

At the meeting, commercial departments proposed that in order to promote production development, it is necessary to implement the spirit of "completely taking over," buying as much as is planted, buying whenever it is sold, and implementing open sales and door-to-door delivery in terms of supply, to ensure that the broad masses of people can eat a variety of fresh vegetables in all seasons. Production departments also stated that they would immediately take action to rush-plant autumn vegetables, and from this year on, they would basically solve the problem of vegetable supply during the off-season.

    郊区要为城市和工矿区服务
    季季供应新鲜蔬菜
    兰州现场会议要求蔬菜供应工作力争上游
    新华社兰州14日电　农业部和第二商业部联合在兰州召开的蔬菜现场会议，解决了西北各省、区和山西省各城市、新老工矿区、工地蔬菜供应工作力争上游的问题。
    西北地区有许多新兴的工业区，工业发展很快，人口也有迅速增长，但是几年来这些地区的蔬菜供应不能相应地赶上去，一年中冬春两季更是紧张时期。蔬菜供应不足的原因，首先是没有重视贯彻郊区为城市为工矿区服务的方针，因此种植面积小，数量少，品种不多，有一部分地区价格还高。其次，商业部门贯彻执行扶持生产、为生产服务的方针也不够，产销关系只是单纯的买卖关系，没有树立起相互支持的协作关系。经营管理方面存在着资本主义的经营思想，对企业考虑得多，对生产者和消费者考虑得少。
    为了解决上述问题，出席会议的一百多名农业、商业的有关部门负责人以及农民、农业科学技术人员等，在兰州进行了现场参观，交流了经验。兰州郊区已创造了蔬菜的高额丰产经验。如七里河区马滩蔬菜生产合作社今春种植的西红柿，目前一株结柿七、八层，预计亩产可达七万多斤。安宁区先锋蔬菜社的茄子和韭菜，预计亩产可达五万斤和二万斤。大家还参观了西固区四季青社利用废气温室生产蔬菜的情况。参观后，西安等地代表也介绍了各自的蔬菜生产经验。大家在讨论研究中得出共同的丰产经验是：一、密植；二、用覆盖防霜防冻；三、阳畦种植；四、利用废气温室；五、搭高架；六、利用植物生长素。除了大力提高单位面积产量外，还要扩大蔬菜播种面积。
    会上，商业部门提出，为促进生产发展，必须贯彻全部包下来的精神，种多少收购多少，什么时候卖什么时候就收，并且在供应方面实行敞开售货，送货上门，以保证广大人民四季吃到各种各样的新鲜蔬菜。生产部门也表示立即行动起来抢种秋菜，从今年开始就要基本上解决淡季蔬菜的供应问题。
