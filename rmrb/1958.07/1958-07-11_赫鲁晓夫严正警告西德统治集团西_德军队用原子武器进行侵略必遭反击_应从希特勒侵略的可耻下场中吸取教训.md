Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 10th: According to TASS, Soviet Communist Party First Secretary Khrushchev, who was invited to attend the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party, sternly warned the West German ruling clique at a mass rally in Bitterfeld on July 9th to learn a lesson from Hitler's shameful end of aggression and not to follow in his footsteps.

    Khrushchev pointed out that Adenauer is stepping up the equipment of West German troops with atomic weapons and rocket weapons. But do not forget that any country that launches rocket weapons at another country will inevitably be retaliated against by the attacked country. He said that densely populated West Germany would suffer a more tragic disaster in such a war than other countries. If nuclear and rocket weapon bases are established in West Germany, it runs the risk of becoming the target of concentrated fire from such weapons.

    Khrushchev said that, therefore, the West German workers' action against atomic armament is correct; the line taken by the West German Social Democrats on this issue is also correct. The militarization of West Germany is a disastrous road for the German people. The German people have a responsibility to work together to fight to prevent war so that revanchists do not have the opportunity to prepare for a third world war.

    Khrushchev then spoke of the cruelty of the war he witnessed while serving as the military commissar of the Stalingrad Front during the war. He said that anyone who has seen such a tragedy will be determined to do everything possible to prevent history from repeating itself.

    Khrushchev emphasized that the people of the Soviet Union and Germany should be friends. He said that if the German people live in friendship with the Soviet people, then there will never be any war in Europe; no one can provoke war. This is of great benefit to both peoples. His remarks were greeted with a storm of applause from the audience.

    Khrushchev concluded by saying that both the Soviet and German peoples possess a great deal of wealth. These riches should be better used to benefit the people of both countries. In this way we will be able to develop our economies at a higher speed and raise the living standards of our two peoples to a level that is unimaginable under the capitalist system.

    德军队用原子武器进行侵略必遭反击
    应从希特勒侵略的可耻下场中吸取教训
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社柏林9日讯：应邀参加德国统一社会党第五次代表大会的苏联共产党第一书记赫鲁晓夫9日在比特菲尔德群众大会上讲话，严正警告西德统治集团要从希特勒侵略的可耻下场中吸取教训，不要步他的后尘。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，阿登纳正在加紧用原子武器和火箭武器装备西德军队。但是不要忘记，任何一个国家向别国发射火箭武器，它将必然受到被攻击国的还击。他说，人口密集的西德在这样的战争中将会遭到比其他国家更加悲惨的灾难。如果西德境内建立核武器和火箭武器的基地，它就有变成遭受这类武器集中射击的目标的危险。
    赫鲁晓夫说，因此，西德工人反原子武装的行动是正确的；西德社会民主党人在这个问题上所采取的路线也是正确的。西德军国主义化对于德国人民来说是一条毁灭性的道路。德国人民有责任同心协力为防止战争而斗争，以便不让复仇主义者有机会准备第三次世界大战。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到战争期间他在担任斯大林格勒前线军事委员时所目睹的战争的残酷景象。他说，凡是见过这种惨象的人都会下定决心要竭尽一切努力防止历史重演。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏德两国人民应该作朋友。他说，如果德国人民同苏联人民友好相处，那么在欧洲就绝不会发生任何战争；任何人都不可能挑起战争来。这对两国人民都有莫大的好处。他的这番话获得了全场暴风雨般的鼓掌。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，苏联人民和德国人民都拥有大量财富。应当更好地利用这些财富为两国人民造福。这样我们将能够用更高的速度来发展我们的经济，把我们两国人民的生活水平提高到资本主义制度下所不能设想的水平。
