Using Indigenous Methods for Comprehensive Utilization of Sulfur Resources
Yangquan Sulfur Cooperative Uses Waste Gas and Residue to Produce Five Products Including Pig Iron, Cement, Nitrogen Fertilizer, Sulfurous Acid, and Black Alum

According to Shanxi Daily news: The twelve sulfur production cooperatives in Yangquan City have built more than fifty branch factories in half a month, utilizing the waste gas and residue from the sulfur production process to produce five new products including pig iron, cement, nitrogen fertilizer, sulfurous acid, and black alum, developing into comprehensive enterprises.

Yangquan City's sulfur production has seen great improvements in sulfur refining technology, but it can only refine sulfur ore into sulfur. The large amount of chemical components generated during the sulfur refining process turned into harmful gases and escaped from the chimneys. Sulfur cinder and sulfur ore residue containing valuable resources such as ferric oxide, ammonium sulfate, and black alum, were discarded as waste.

After the upsurge of the mass campaign to develop local industries was launched, the Yangquan City Handicraft Industry Cooperative Association transferred more than ten cadres to the Nanyaozhuang Sulfur Cooperative for experimentation, using the method of integrated industrial development to comprehensively utilize sulfur resources. The specific approach is: based on the sulfur production process, whatever resources are available are used to develop whatever wealth is possible, and whatever wealth is developed, that is what factories are built for. The cadres of the Municipal Cooperative Association and the workers of the Nanyaozhuang Sulfur Cooperative, after three days and nights of hard work, built five branch factories. These five factories are: (1) A stove was built around the chimney of the sulfur refining furnace, and an iron pot was installed to generate steam. Then, a pipe was connected from the chimney of the sulfur furnace to allow the sulfur dioxide gas in the chimney to meet the steam and condense into sulfurous acid. With almost no investment, a sulfurous acid factory was built. The two sulfur furnaces equipped with this device can produce more than 100 jin of sulfurous acid every day. (2) They built a straw shed, bought six large wooden barrels and several magnetic urns and iron pots, and installed a stove, creating a nitrogen fertilizer branch factory. They used the sulfur cinder left over from making sulfur blocks, dissolved and boiled it to extract ammonium sulfate. With only two people operating, they can produce more than 160 jin of high-grade nitrogen fertilizer every day. (3) A native blast furnace was built near the sulfur refining furnace to smelt iron using the slag left over from sulfur refining. It can smelt two to three tons of gray pig iron every day. The investment in this branch factory was only 760 yuan. (4) Several sets of stone mills were installed near the iron smelting furnace, and a cave was dug. The iron slag discharged during the iron smelting process was mixed with locally produced limestone and gypsum, then baked, crushed, and formulated to make cement with a grade of 200 to 400. This branch factory only uses four and a half laborers and can produce more than one ton of cement every day. (5) Three straw sheds were built, more than thirty urns were bought, dozens of iron pots were installed, and six pools were built to extract black alum from the sulfur refining slag with a lower iron content. This branch factory only has six workers and can produce 1,000 to 1,500 jin of black alum every day. The slag powder left over after extracting black alum is also a good fertilizer welcomed by agricultural cooperatives.

This method of integrated industrial development has many advantages. First, it requires less investment, construction is fast, and returns are high. The five branch factories built by the Nanyaozhuang Sulfur Cooperative took only three days, with a total investment of only more than 1,300 yuan, while the total output value of these five branch factories this year can reach more than 180,000 yuan. Second, it saves equipment and tools. Relying on existing enterprises to build factories means that there is no need to specifically purchase construction materials, and the tools of existing enterprises can be used, as well as many leftover materials and waste materials from existing enterprises. After the new factories are put into production, many tools and equipment can be used uniformly and allocated to each other. Third, it can greatly save manpower. The five branch factories built by the Nanyaozhuang Sulfur Cooperative did not use a single outside worker, all of them were built by the cooperative's own workers. They insisted on production during the day, and then launched a concentrated effort to build factories after work, building five small factories in three days.

The Yangquan City Handicraft Industry Cooperative Association promptly summarized the experience of the Nanyaozhuang Sulfur Cooperative and promoted it throughout the city. From June 15th to July 1st, in half a month, the twelve sulfur cooperatives in the city have built more than fifty branch factories, developing into comprehensive enterprises. A total of ten small iron factories, twelve nitrogen fertilizer factories, nine black alum factories, twelve sulfurous acid factories, and ten cement factories have been established. According to the most conservative estimate, the production capacity of these fifty branch factories this year can produce more than 10,000 tons of pig iron, more than 860 tons of sulfurous acid, more than 4,900 tons of cement, more than 370 tons of ammonium sulfate, and more than 4,500 tons of black alum.

    用土法综合利用硫磺资源
    阳泉硫磺社利用废气废渣生产出生铁、水泥、氮肥、亚硫酸、黑矾等五种产品
    据山西日报消息　阳泉市十二个硫磺生产合作社，半个月建成五十多个分厂，利用硫磺生产过程中的废气、废渣，生产出了生铁、水泥、氮肥、亚硫酸、黑矾等五种新产品，发展成了综合性的企业。
    阳泉市的硫磺生产，在炼磺技术上有很大改进，但是也只能把硫磺矿石炼成硫磺。炼磺过程中产生的大量化学成分，变成了有害气体从烟道中跑走了。含有大量氧化铁、硫酸氨、黑矾等宝贵财富的硫磺脚渣与硫磺矿渣，被当作废物丢弃。
    全民大办地方工业的热潮掀起后，阳泉市手工业联社抽调了十余名干部在南窑庄磺业社试验，用一条龙发展工业的方法，综合利用硫磺资源。具体做法是：根据硫磺的生产过程，有什么资源就开发什么财富，开发什么财富就建立什么工厂。市联社的干部和南窑庄磺业社的职工们，经过三昼夜苦战，就建设起五座分厂，这五座厂是：（1）在炼磺炉的烟道处盘了一灶火，安了一口铁锅，烧出水蒸气来，然后从磺炉烟道上接出一根管子，使烟道里的二氧化硫气体和水蒸气相遇凝结，变成亚硫酸；几乎不用什么投资，就建成一座亚硫酸厂，两个磺炉建设了这种设备，每天可以生产一百余斤亚硫酸。（2）他们搭了一个席棚子，买了六只大木桶和几只磁瓮、铁锅，安了一盘火，就建成了一座氮肥分厂，利用制硫磺块剩下的硫磺脚渣，加以溶解、熬制，提炼硫酸氨，只要两个人操作，每天即可生产出一百六十多斤高级氮肥。（3）在炼磺炉附近建设了一座土高炉，利用炼硫磺后剩下的炉渣炼铁，每天可以炼出二至三吨灰生铁，这个分厂的投资只有七百六十元。（4）在炼铁炉附近安几盘碾子，挖一个窑洞，利用炼铁过程中排泄出来的铁渣，渗和附近出产的石灰石、石膏，加以烙烧、粉碎、配制，即是标高二百至四百号的水泥。这个分厂只用四个半劳力，每天可以生产出一吨多水泥。（5）搭了三个席棚子，买了三十多个瓮，安了十数口铁锅，垒了六个池子，利用含铁量较少的炼磺炉渣提炼黑矾；这个分厂只有六个工人，每天可以生产黑矾一千斤至一千五百斤；提炼黑矾后剩下的渣粉，也是很受农业社欢迎的好肥料。
    这种一条龙发展工业的方法好处很多，首先是投资少，建设快，收益大。南窑庄磺业社建设的五个分厂，只用了三天时间，总投资只有一千三百余元，而这五个分厂今年的总产值即可达到十八万余元。其次是省设备、省工具。依靠原有企业建厂，建厂中不用专门购置建设器材，可以利用原有企业的工具，也可以利用原有企业的许多剩料、废料；新工厂投入生产后，许多工具、设备，又可以统一使用，互相调配。第三、可以大大节省人力。南窑庄磺业社建设的五个分厂，没有用一个外工，全部是这个社职工们自己修建的，他们白天坚持生产，下班后就突击建厂，三天就建成了五个小工厂。
    阳泉市手工业联社及时总结了南窑庄磺业社的经验，在全市范围内进行推广。从6月15日至7月1日，半个月时间，全市十二个磺业社已建起五十多个分厂，发展成了综合性的企业。共建立了十个小铁厂，十二座氮肥厂，九座黑矾厂，十二座亚硫酸厂，十座水泥厂。这五十多个分厂的生产能力，按最保守的估计，今年就可以生产出一万余吨生铁，八百六十余吨亚硫酸，四千九百余吨水泥，三百七十余吨硫酸氨，四千五百余吨黑矾。
