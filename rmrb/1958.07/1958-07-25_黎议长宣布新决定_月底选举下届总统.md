Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 24th - Lebanese Parliament Speaker Oseiran announced on the 23rd that the parliament will hold a meeting on July 31st to elect the next president. This election was originally scheduled for July 24th. Oseiran had announced "indefinite postponement" on the 22nd. Oseiran made this new decision after meeting with the American-backed President Chamoun on the morning of July 23rd. He immediately notified the parliamentarians afterwards.

On the same morning, Chamoun held secret talks in batches of two or three with the twenty-five parliamentarians who support him on the issue of presidential elections. On the same day, parliamentarians supporting the Chamoun faction sent a four-member delegation to meet with U.S. President's "Special Political Representative" Murphy.

The notorious American conspirator Murphy has been in Beirut for the past few days carrying out so-called "mediation" between the Chamoun regime and the opposition, forcing the opposition to accept the election of a new president to the liking of the United States through the current parliament.

    黎议长宣布新决定  月底选举下届总统
    据新华社24日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩议会议长奥塞兰在23日宣布，议会将在7月31日举行会议选举下届总统。这个选举原定7月24日举行。奥塞兰曾经在22日宣布“无定期延期”。奥塞兰是在7月23日上午同美国支持的总统夏蒙举行会谈后，采取这个新决定的。他随后立即向议员们发出通知。
    同天上午夏蒙曾分批同支持他的二十五名议员就选举总统问题密谈，每批两三人。同天，支持夏蒙集团的议员派遣了一个由四人组成的代表团去同美国总统的“特别政治代表”墨菲会谈。
    恶名昭彰的美国阴谋家墨菲过去几天中一直在贝鲁特进行所谓在夏蒙政权和反对党之间“调停”的活动，迫使反对党接受通过现议会选出一个合乎美国心意的新总统。
