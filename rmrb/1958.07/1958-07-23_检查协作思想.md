Column: Editor's Note

    During the fourth stage of the rectification campaign, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulated that all units in the city should make opposing departmentalism, promoting communist collaboration, and fully supporting the industrial development of Yunnan, Guizhou, and various parts of Sichuan provinces as important content of this stage of the rectification campaign. This is a very good approach.

    Originally, mutual support and mutual collaboration are fundamental principles in the development of socialist production and the main hallmarks of communist ideology. Marxism tells us that all production is social production. Objectively, it is interconnected, interdependent, and mutually constrained; it is not isolated. If one only cares about one's own development without helping or supporting others, the result will be that one's own development will inevitably be limited. The production of our socialist country is an organic whole, and a region or unit is only a component part of the entire country, like the relationship between a cell and a human body. If a component part or a cell is separated from the whole, it cannot exist.

    Vigorously carrying out communist collaboration education and conscientiously examining the ideology of collaboration, so that every cadre and worker recognizes his or her responsibility and consciously undertakes collaborative tasks, can not only powerfully support the industrial development of neighboring regions but also directly promote the development and improvement of industrial production in one's own enterprise and region.

    检查协作思想
    在整风第四阶段，中共重庆市委规定全市各单位要把反对本位主义，提倡共产主义大协作，全力支援云南、贵州和四川各地工业的发展，作为整风这一阶段的重要内容，这是很好的办法。
    本来，相互支援，相互协作，是社会主义生产发展中的一条根本原则，是共产主义思想的主要标志。马克思主义告诉我们，任何生产都是社会生产，客观上它是相互联系、相互依存和相互约制着的，都不是孤立的。假使只顾自己发展，而不帮助别人，支援别人，其结果，自己的发展必然会受到限制。我们社会主义国家的生产是一个有机的整体，一个地区和一个单位只是整个国家的组成部分。像一个细胞和人体的关系一样。假若一个组成部分和一个细胞离开了整体，它本身也就不可能存在。
    大力进行共产主义协作教育，并且认真地检查协作思想，使每个干部、职工都认识到自己的责任，自觉地承担起协作任务，不仅可以有力地支援邻近地区工业的发展，而且也能直接推动本企业、本地区工业生产的发展和提高。
