The Qinghai Postal and Telecommunications Departments Revise Rules and Regulations
Making Major Reforms to Benefit the People

(Our Dispatch) In order to facilitate the masses and production, the Qinghai Province Postal and Telecommunications departments have revised more than 30 unreasonable rules and regulations in the spirit of major reform.

The Qinghai Province Postal and Telecommunications departments' revisions to unreasonable rules and regulations fully take into account the characteristics of the province, such as its vast territory, sparse population, scattered residences, and inconvenient transportation. In postal services, there used to be a "package overdue fee" which stipulated that if a package was not picked up within one week of the delivery of the pick-up notice, a penalty of one dime would be charged for each day of delay. Rural people and geological prospecting personnel, etc., "often incurred penalties due to long distances or high job mobility. In some cases, the overdue fines even exceeded the value of the package itself. Now, this system which has been in use for many years has been abolished.

In terms of remittances, in the past, withdrawals had to be made at a designated post office regardless of the situation. This also caused some inconvenience to the masses. For example, a post office has been established in Ping'an Town, Huangzhong County, but the remitter was unaware of this and filled in the withdrawal unit as Huangzhong County Post Office. A round trip from Ping'an Town to the Huangzhong County Post Office takes three or four days. The current rule is that as long as it is within the city or county, remittances can be made at any post office. In remote and inconvenient areas, postmen also deliver the money to the homes of the masses. Systems such as letter inquiry fees, withdrawal of lost money orders, and late payment fines have also been modified.

In terms of telecommunications business, in addition to reducing or eliminating fees for sending telegrams, translating telegrams, and copying telegram drafts, the department has also established a system of drafting telegrams on behalf of senders, taking into account Qinghai Province's backward culture.

    青海邮电部门修订规章制度
    大破大立　便利群众
    本报讯　青海省邮电部门为了便利群众，便利生产，以大破大立的精神修改了三十多种不合理的规章制度。
    青海省邮电部门修改不合理的规章制度，充分照顾了本省地区辽阔、人口稀少、居住分散和交通不便等特点。在邮政方面，以往的制度中有一项“包裹逾期费”，就是从包裹领取通知单送到之日起一星期内不提取者，超过一天罚一角。农村群众和地质勘探人员等“由于路途远或者工作流动性大，常常逾期受罚。有的逾期罚款还超过了包裹本身的价值。现在，这条沿用多年的制度已经取消了。
    在汇兑方面，过去不管什么情况，一律要在指定的邮局取款。这也为群众造成一些麻烦。例如，湟中县平安镇已经建立邮局，但寄款人不了解这个情况，填写的取款单位是湟中县邮局，而平安镇到湟中县邮局来回需走三、四天。现在的规定是：只要不出市区和县境，便可以通兑。在偏僻和交通不便的地区，投递员还把款子送到群众家里。查信收费、汇票丢失取款、欠资罚款等制度，也分别作了修改。
    在电讯营业方面，除了发报、译报、抄录报底，减少收费或不收费以外，还根据青海省文化落后的情况，建立了为发报人代写电报稿等制度。　（李瑛）
