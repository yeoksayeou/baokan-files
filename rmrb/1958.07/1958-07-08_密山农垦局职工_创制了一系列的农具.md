    Employees of Mishan State Farm Bureau
    Invented a Series of Farm Tools
    Employees of the Mishan State Farm Bureau in Heilongjiang Province have created a variety of land reclamation, planting, and harvesting machines on the land of the Great Northern Wilderness.
    In this area, the high soil moisture content often caused obstacles such as vehicles getting stuck and blocked during land reclamation, preventing normal operation. Often, one vehicle could not complete one hectare of land in a day. The employees of the Farm Bureau devised a method to install wide wooden blocks on the tracks of the tractors and the wheels of the five-铧 plows, just like putting on wooden shoes for people, so that the tractors and five-铧 plows would no longer be naughty. Each vehicle can complete six to seven hectares of tasks per day. The shrubs growing in the wilderness could only be dug up by one person at a rate of a dozen to twenty per day, which seriously affected the speed of land reclamation. Therefore, the employees created a shrub removal device and installed it on the bulldozer in front of the tractor, removing 6,000 to 9,000 shrubs per day. The modified ditching and drainage plow has also greatly improved efficiency and saved labor. This plow is pulled by a tractor and can dig 40 li of ditches in one day, while it originally took 30 people one day to dig 300 meters of ditches. In order to plant all the wasteland opened in the spring with seeds, the employees set up a seeding box on the five-铧 plow and installed a seat at the tail of the plow, so that the farm tool operator could sit on the seat and shake the handle of the seeding box to sow seeds. This multi-purpose operating vehicle, which is modified from a rubber-tired cart, is also popular among local farmers. This vehicle is equipped with a seed box, a manure box, and a ridging device on the cart, which is driven by the rubber tires of the cart, and can carry out sowing, fertilization, and ridging. Its operating efficiency is twice as high as that of a wooden plow (pulled by six horses and operated by two people). By the time of the autumn harvest, the temperature in the Great Northern Wilderness often drops to minus 20 or 30 degrees Celsius, and prolonging the heavy threshing operation for one day would result in incalculable losses. In order to solve this critical problem, they also trial-produced the 5-55 thresher with wood, which played an important role in advancing threshing. It improves efficiency by 40% compared with the original MK-1100 thresher.

### 密山农垦局职工  创制了一系列的农具

    密山农垦局职工
    创制了一系列的农具
    黑龙江省密山农垦局职工在北大荒土地上创造了多种开荒播种和收获机具。
    这个地区土壤含水量大，开荒时陷车、堵车等障碍常使作业不能正常进行，往往一台机车一天完不成一垧地任务。农垦局职工设法给拖拉机的链轨和五铧犁轮子上安装上宽木块，就犹如给人穿上了木履，拖拉机和五铧犁就再不调皮了，每台车每天可完成六、七垧任务。荒地上丛生着的灌木，一个人一天只能挖掘十几棵到二十几棵，严重影响了开荒速度。于是，职工们创造了灌木清除器，把这个器械安装在拖拉机前的推土机上，一天就清除灌木六千到九千棵。改装的开沟排水犁，也同样大大提高了效率，节省了劳力。这种犁由拖拉机牵引，一天开沟四十里，而原来一天三十人才开沟三百公尺。为了使春天开的荒地全部播上种子，职工们在五铧犁上设置一个播种箱，犁尾安上个座位，农具手就可以坐在座位上摇动播种箱的扶手进行播种。这是用胶轮大车改装的多种作业车，也受到了当地农民的欢迎。这种车是在大车上安种子箱、厩肥箱、陇作器，由大车胶轮带动，就可进行播种、施肥、起陇，他的作业效率比木犁高一倍（用六匹马拉，两个人操纵）。到秋收时，北大荒的气温常到零下二、三十度，繁重的脱谷作业延长一天就有无法计算的损失。为了解决这一带有关键性的问题，他们又用木料试制了5—55脱谷机，对提早脱谷起了重要作用，它比原有的MK—1100脱谷机提高效率40％。
