Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to congratulate the Pan-African Student Conference being held at Makerere University in Uganda from July 1st to 7th.

In its congratulatory telegram, the All-China Students' Federation wished the conference, a symbol of the great unity of African students, the greatest success, and expressed its firm belief that the conference would make a significant contribution to uniting and mobilizing all African youth and students to fight against colonialism.

The telegram stated: "The Chinese people have personally experienced in their struggle that the imperialist aggressor bloc headed by U.S. imperialism is the root cause of the suffering of oppressed nations in the colonies and the greatest enemy of peace-loving and just people around the world. However, imperialism is just a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak inside. The Chinese youth, together with the Chinese people, have never been intimidated by the seemingly powerful imperialist aggressors. On the contrary, relying on the united struggle of the people of the whole country, they finally drove them away and achieved complete liberation. Especially today, when the world's forces of peace and democracy have surpassed the forces of imperialist war, and 1.4 billion people have achieved national independence, we firmly believe that as long as the African people and youth and students unite and wage a resolute struggle against imperialism, it will not be long before the imperialists will be driven out by the African people, just as they have been in other parts of the world.

"Chinese students will always be your closest and most trustworthy friends. We always pay attention to and support your struggle with the greatest sympathy, and strive together to eliminate colonialism and defend world peace. Long live the friendly unity between Chinese and African students!"

    全国学联电贺泛非学生会议
    新华社1日讯　中华全国学生联合会今天致电祝贺1日到7日在乌干达马克雷尔大学举行的泛非学生会议。
    全国学联在贺电中预祝这个象征非洲学生大团结的会议获得最大的成功，并且表示深信这次会议将对团结和动员全非洲青年学生为反对殖民主义而斗争作出巨大贡献。
    贺电说：“中国人民在斗争中亲身体会到以美国帝国主义为首的帝国主义侵略集团是殖民地被压迫民族遭受祸害的根源，是全世界爱好和平和正义人民的最大敌人。但是帝国主义只是一只外强中干的纸老虎，中国青年和中国人民一起，从来没有被暂时看起来是强大的帝国主义侵略者吓倒过，相反的依靠了全国人民的团结斗争，终于赶走了他们，获得了彻底的解放。特别在今天，当世界和平民主力量已经超过了帝国主义战争力量，已经有十四亿人口获得了民族独立，我们坚信，只要非洲人民和青年学生团结起来，同帝国主义作坚决的斗争，在不要很多的时间内，帝国主义者最后一定会像在世界其它地区一样被非洲人民赶走。
    “中国学生永远是你们最亲密和可信赖的朋友。我们始终以最大的同情关注和支持你们的斗争，为消灭殖民主义和保卫世界和平而共同奋斗。中国和非洲各国学生之间的友好团结万岁！”
