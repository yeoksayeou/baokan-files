Xinhua News Agency report: Danish Communist Party Vice Chairman Alfred Jensen wrote an article, "Scandinavia is Breaking Away," published in the French monthly "New Democracy" in May, discussing the increasingly strong neutralist tendencies in the Nordic countries.

Jensen first pointed out that in March of this year, the foreign ministers and ministers of foreign affairs of the Nordic countries held a meeting in Stockholm, where they adopted three proposals advocating the cessation of nuclear explosion tests, holding talks between East and West, and establishing non-nuclear zones in Europe. Iceland, Norway, and Denmark, the three member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), had previously followed Western policies, but this time they put forward proposals at the meeting that were more in line with the traditional neutral policy that the Scandinavian countries had consistently pursued for many years.

Jensen said: The common attitude adopted by the Nordic foreign ministers also reflects the bankruptcy of the conspiracy to drag Finland and Sweden into the Western bloc.

Jensen pointed out that after World War II, in an attempt to seize world hegemony, the United States, through economic, political, and diplomatic offensives and propaganda activities, placed Norway and Denmark under its influence and control, and dragged them into NATO.

Jensen continued, but NATO's policies were unpopular in the Nordic countries from day one. For example, NATO's demand to extend the term of military service was resisted, and neither Norway nor Denmark accepted a term of service longer than eighteen months. Denmark even held demonstrations with soldiers participating, opposing the eighteen-month term of service, and as a result, the government had to restore the term of service to sixteen months. Norwegian officers opposed concentrating armed forces in northern Norway and weakening the defense forces in the south, and several senior officers resigned as a result. From the beginning, Norway refused to station foreign troops in the country. In 1952, when the United States proposed transferring the US Air Force to bases in Denmark, it aroused strong opposition from Danish public opinion. The coalition government, then composed of the Farmers' Party and the Conservative Party, had to shelve this decision. The Social Democratic Party saw the strength of popular opposition to the US demand during the election campaign in the spring of 1953, so it changed its attitude and stated in July 1953 that it must reject the US demand. When the Paris Accords allowed West Germany to join NATO, Denmark and Norway experienced large-scale mass movements, which influenced the parliament's attitude toward certain issues.

Subsequently, the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt in 1956, the armed rebellion of counter-revolutionaries in Hungary, NATO's equipping of Western European armies with atomic missiles, and scientists' assessments of the consequences of atomic bomb explosions all strengthened the tide of striving for neutrality. Bulganin's letters to the Norwegian and Danish prime ministers in March of this year once again promoted this activity.

Jensen said that it is difficult to correctly estimate the strength and depth of this mass movement for neutrality and against NATO policies in recent years. However, one thing is certain: under the pressure of public opinion in Norway and Denmark, Prime Ministers Gerhardsen and Hansen finally determined the attitude they would take at the NATO Council meeting held last December. When they proposed negotiations with socialist countries and opposed the deployment of missiles and atomic weapons in Europe to prevent making the above-mentioned negotiations more difficult, they expressed the Nordic people's desire to end the Cold War, stop the arms race, and eliminate the threat of global destruction.

Jensen continued, but there are still some people in Scandinavia who cling to NATO. Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange's proposal, which aims to deploy missiles in Europe, is a clever scheme that violates the will of the Norwegian people and allows the United States to promote the implementation of its plans as it pleases. The Norwegian right wing supports Lange, hoping to continue pursuing a policy of strength.

The Danish Conservative Party, which represents big financial capital, had been advocating throughout 1957 that Denmark should possess the most modern weapons, namely missiles and nuclear weapons. However, it finally had to bow its head before public opinion.

The same tendency exists in Sweden: the Liberal Party has been putting pressure on the government for a long time, demanding a policy more consistent with the West. However, with broad popular support, the Swedish government is determined to continue its neutral policy.

Jensen said that the attitude of some politicians towards the Rapacki Plan reflects a trend among the people. Swedish Foreign Minister Undén once said that this plan must be tried. The parliamentary debates in Norway and Denmark also fully supported the implementation of the Rapacki Plan.

Danish Prime Minister Hansen, who is also the Foreign Minister, clarified in Parliament the attitude he took in Paris. The chairmen of the six parties participating in Parliament unconditionally supported the policy of negotiation and the path to easing the situation proposed in this speech. This is the first time since the implementation of the Marshall Plan and participation in NATO that Parliament has reached a unanimous agreement on the government's foreign policy direction.

Only Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, during the parliamentary debate on foreign policy on January 30 and 31, expressed the opposite view, wanting to unite with NATO. However, it is not difficult for us to see some differences within the Norwegian government.

For example, regarding the issue of arming the Norwegian army with atomic weapons, Prime Minister Gerhardsen said:

"Our refusal of atomic weapons is a direct consequence of pursuing our basic policy. ...At the same time, we also consider what consequences it would have if a country extremely close to the Soviet Union possessed atomic weapons."

The result of the debate was encouraging. The Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Finn Moe, declared that NATO must fundamentally change its policy, and the current task is to hold negotiations, and it will be so in the future.

Jensen said: These disputes fully demonstrate that under the pressure of the masses, Norway and Denmark are distancing themselves from NATO and are "breaking away."

Jensen also pointed out that the same trend has emerged regarding the Common Market. The Danish trade union leadership expressed opposition to the Common Market. Industrialists and shipowners have also issued solemn warnings. The number of people within the Danish government who oppose the Common Market has increased. Even the Conservative Party member, former Finance Minister Thorkil Kristensen, said that the Danish economy is unable to compete with strong foreign monopoly companies. People are not only afraid of the danger of war that may come from Germany, but also of the danger posed by some German joint ventures and monopoly capitalists themselves.

Jensen said: All this helps to strengthen the neutralist tendencies shown in the meeting of foreign ministers and ministers of foreign affairs in Stockholm in March (this year).

    丹麦共产党副主席任生著文
    论北欧国家中立主义倾向
    据新华社讯  法国“新民主”月刊5月号刊载了丹麦共产党副主席阿尔弗雷德·任生写的文章：“斯堪的纳维亚正在摆脱”，论述了北欧国家愈来愈强烈的中立主义倾向。
    任生首先指出，今年3月，北欧各国的外交大臣和外交部长在斯德哥尔摩举行会议，会上通过了主张停止核爆炸试验、举行东西方之间的会谈和在欧洲建立非核子地区等的三个建议。北大西洋集团的三个成员国——冰岛、挪威和丹麦以前一直追随着西方政策，但是这一次它们在会上提出了比较符合于斯堪的纳维亚各国多少年来一致奉行的传统中立政策的主张。
    任生说：北欧各国外长所采取的共同态度也反映了试图把芬兰和瑞典拉入西方集团这一阴谋的破产。
    任生指出，第二次世界大战后，为了企图攫取世界霸权，美国通过经济、政治、外交上的进攻和宣传活动把挪威和丹麦置于它的影响和控制之下，把它们拉入了北大西洋集团。
    任生接着指出，但是北大西洋集团的政策从第一天起，就在北欧国家中是不得人心的。例如，北大西洋集团打算延长兵役期的要求遭到了反抗，挪威和丹麦都没有接受十八个月以上的服役期。丹麦甚至举行了有士兵参加的示威游行，反对十八个月的兵役期，结果政府不得不把兵役期恢复到十六个月。挪威的军官反对把武装部队集中在挪威北部，反对削弱南部的防御力量，有好几名高级军官因此辞职。挪威从最初起就拒绝在本国驻扎外国军队。1952年当美国提出要在丹麦的基地上调来美国空军时，激起了丹麦舆论的强烈反对，当时由农民党和保守党组成的联合政府只好把这一决定搁置起来，社会民主党在1953年春天的竞选运动中看到了人民群众反对美国要求的力量强大，因此便改变了态度，在1953年7月表示必须拒绝美国这种要求。当巴黎协定让西德加入北大西洋集团时，丹麦和挪威曾经发生了规模宏大的群众运动，它影响了议会对某些问题的态度。
    随后，1956年英法侵略埃及、匈牙利的反革命分子武装叛乱、北大西洋集团用原子导弹装备西欧各国军队、科学家对原子弹爆炸后果的估价，这种种因素都加强了争取走向中立的浪潮。布尔加宁今年3月写给挪威首相和丹麦首相的信件再一次地推动了这一活动。
    任生说很难正确估计近几年来，为争取中立和反对北大西洋集团政策而进行的这种群众运动的力量和深入程度。但是，有一点却可以肯定，即：在挪威和丹麦的舆论压力下，基哈德森和汉森两位首相终于在去年12月举行的北大西洋集团理事会上确定了自己所要采取的态度。当他们提出同社会主义国家进行谈判，反对在欧洲设置导弹和原子武器，以防止使上述谈判更加困难时，他们表达了北欧人民要求结束冷战、停止扩军备战和消除整个世界遭到毁灭威胁的意愿。
    任生接着指出，但是，在斯堪的纳维亚还有些人依附着北大西洋集团不放。挪威外交大臣兰格提出的建议，目的是要在欧洲设置导弹，便是一种巧妙的计谋，是同挪威人民的意愿相违背的，它使美国可以随心所欲地推动它的计划的执行。挪威的右派支持兰格，希望继续奉行实力政策。
    代表大金融资本的丹麦保守党在1957年全年内一直在主张丹麦拥有最近代化的武器装备，即导弹和核武器。可是它最后还是不得不在舆论面前低头。
    瑞典也存在同样的倾向：自由党在很长的时间内向政府施加压力，要求奉行与西方更为一致的政策。然而，在人民广泛支持下，瑞典政府坚决要继续中立政策。
    任生说一些政治家对腊帕茨基计划所抱的态度反映了人民中间发生的一股潮流。瑞典外交大臣恩顿曾经说，这个计划必须试一试。挪威和丹麦的议会辩论也完全赞成实行腊帕茨基计划。
    兼外交大臣的丹麦首相汉森在议会阐明了他在巴黎时采取的态度，参加议会的六个政党主席都无条件地支持这一演说中提出的谈判政策和缓和局势途径。这是自从实行马歇尔计划和参加北大西洋集团以来，议会第一次就政府外交政策方针达成一致协议。
    只有挪威外交大臣兰格在1月30和31日议会辩论外交政策时，相反表示要同北大西洋集团团结一致。然而，我们也不难从挪威政府里面看出一些分歧。
    例如，关于用以原子武器武装挪威军队问题，基哈德森首相是这样讲的：
    “我们之所以拒绝原子武器，这是奉行我们基本政策的直接后果。……同时我们也考虑到，一个极其靠近苏联的国家拥有原子武器会造成什么后果。”
    辩论的结果是令人振奋的，当时外交委员会主席芬·穆声明说，北大西洋集团必须根本改变它的政策，而当前的任务是举行谈判，将来还是如此。
    任生说：这些争论充分表明，在群众压力之下，挪威和丹麦正在疏远北大西洋集团，正在“摆脱”。
    任生还指出，关于共同市场，也出现了同样的趋向。丹麦工会领导机构表示反对共同市场。工业家和船主也都发出郑重警告。丹麦政府内部反对共同市场的多数派人数增加了。连保守党员、前财政大臣托基尔·克里斯坦逊也说，丹麦经济无力同外国强有力的垄断公司竞争。人们不仅对可能来自德国的战争危险感到恐惧，而且对德国一些联合企业和垄断资本家本身所意味着的危险也感到害怕。
    任生说：这一切都有助于加强（今年）3月份各外交大臣和外长在斯德哥尔摩会谈中表明的中立主义倾向。
