The First Tractor Factory Produces Official Products
"Dongfanghong" Brand Tractors to Produce 300 Units This Year

(Our newspaper, Luoyang, 25th) The Luoyang First Tractor Factory produced its first official product – a "Dongfanghong" brand 54-horsepower tractor – on the 20th of this month. This is a product manufactured one and a half years ahead of schedule by the factory's employees, following the successful trial production of twenty 16-horsepower gas tractors on "May Day" this year, using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods under extremely incomplete production conditions. In the second half of this year, they will also produce 300 "Dongfanghong" brand tractors and 1,000 sixteen-horsepower tractors.

In the Great Leap Forward, the employees of the First Tractor Factory displayed a spirit of daring to think and daring to do. The Dongfanghong brand tractor was produced while construction and installation were still underway. Currently, the factory is at the peak of civil engineering and equipment installation. The scaffolding in many basic production workshops has not yet been removed, and very little equipment has been installed. In the iron foundry workshop, with only 60% of the civil engineering completed and only 8% of the process equipment installed, the employees overcame numerous difficulties and, using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, smelted the first batch of molten iron on a yellow earth floor half a year ahead of schedule on "July 1st," ensuring the supply of tractor casting parts. In the chassis assembly workshop, only about 10% of the originally designed equipment is currently operational, and most of the tools and fixtures are missing. The workers themselves made more than 150 sets of fixtures from scrap iron. They also adopted methods such as converting machine tools that produced single parts into multi-production, and finally assembled the first tractor ahead of schedule.

The Dongfanghong brand tractor is designed according to the Soviet DET-54 tracked tractor.

### 第一拖拉机厂造出正式产品  “东方红”牌拖拉机今年可产三百台

    第一拖拉机厂造出正式产品
    “东方红”牌拖拉机今年可产三百台
    本报洛阳25日电　洛阳第一拖拉机厂在本月20日生产出第一台正式产品——“东方红”牌54马力的拖拉机。这是这个厂的职工，继今年“五一”试制成功二十台16马力煤气拖拉机之后，在生产条件非常不完备的情况下，采取土洋并举的办法，提前一年半制造出来的产品。今年下半年，他们还将生产“东方红”牌拖拉机三百台，十六马力拖拉机一千台。
    第一拖拉机厂的职工在大跃进中，发挥了敢想敢干的精神。东方红牌拖拉机，是在边建设、边安装的情况下生产出来的。目前这个厂正处在土建和安装设备的高峰。许多基本生产车间的脚手架还没有拆除，设备还安装得很少。铸铁车间的职工在土建工程只完成60％，工艺设备仅安装8％的情况下，克服重重困难，用土洋并举的办法，在一片黄土的地坪上，提前半年时间，在“七一”炼出了第一炉铁水，保证了生产拖拉机铸件的供应。底盘装配车间，目前能够开动的设备只有原设计的10％左右，大部分工、卡具都没有。工人自己用废铁制卡具一百五十多套。他们还采用改生产单一零件的机床为多种生产等办法，终于提前装配出第一台拖拉机。
    东方红牌拖拉机，是根据苏联德特54型履带式拖拉机设计的。
