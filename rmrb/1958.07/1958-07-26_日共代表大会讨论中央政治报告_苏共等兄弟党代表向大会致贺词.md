Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch: The Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party continued its plenary session on the 24th.

　　The congress discussed the political report. The main points of the discussion included: the characteristics of post-war Japanese capitalism, the policies of US-Japan monopoly capital, the revival of Japanese imperialism and its subservience to the United States, peaceful coexistence and the threat of war, etc.

　　Nineteen delegates spoke at the meeting on the 24th. Then, the head of the Soviet Communist Party delegation, Mitin, delivered a congratulatory speech. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, all Communist Party members, and the Soviet people, Mitin extended warm fraternal greetings to the Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party, Japanese Communist Party members, and the Japanese working people, and wished the congress success.

　　Mitin expressed his belief that the Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party would help attract and mobilize all the forces of the Japanese people to resolutely oppose the new and serious threat of war looming over the world these days, together with the people of all countries. Mitin said that under the current circumstances, this is the most important and urgent task.

　　Then, Mitin read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party to the Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party. The congratulatory message said: The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party extends sincere fraternal greetings to the Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party and all Japanese Communist Party members.

　　The congratulatory message pointed out: The Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party is being held under such circumstances, namely: the high tide of the international workers' movement, and the further strengthening of the unity of the world communist movement on the ideological basis of Marxism-Leninism in the irreconcilable struggle against revisionism.

　　The congratulatory message said: The Japanese Communist Party actively participates in this struggle. In the more than thirty-six years since its establishment, it has unswervingly carried out a heroic struggle for the interests of the Japanese working class and all working people, for peace, democracy and social progress; its activities follow the great Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Together with all progressive forces in Japan, it actively strives to consolidate international peace, oppose the danger of new wars, strive for the complete national independence of the motherland, and strive to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other peace-loving countries.

　　The congratulatory message said: The Soviet people highly appreciate the Japanese working class's struggle for peace and for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The friendship between the Soviet and Japanese people and the peace-loving people of other countries in the East, as well as the strengthening of economic and cultural cooperation, is the best guarantee of peace in Asia.

　　The congratulatory message said: The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party wishes the Japanese Communist Party new achievements in completing the tasks it faces, in further strengthening the ideological and organizational unity of the party ranks, and in its connection with the working masses.

　　The congratulations of the Soviet Communists won stormy applause from the audience.

　　After that, congratulatory messages from the Indonesian Communist Party, the Italian Communist Party, the Polish United Workers' Party, and other fraternal communist parties were read out at the meeting, and these congratulatory messages were warmly welcomed by the delegates to the congress.

　　A spokesperson for the Japanese Communist Party announced at a press conference on the 24th the resolution passed by the JCP's "Seventh Congress" protesting the aggression against Lebanon and Jordan by US and British imperialists. The resolution pointed out that the actions of the US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan are clearly acts of aggression that interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, and at the same time are provocative acts that cause war. The intention of the US and British imperialists is to undermine the demands and struggles of the entire Arab people for peace and independence, and to realize their ambition to dominate the world.

　　The resolution said that the JCP's "Seventh Congress" and the entire Japanese people severely condemn the aggressive acts of the United States and Britain, and demand that the two countries immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan, while expressing respect and warm support for the heroic struggles of the people of Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, and various Arab countries.

　　The resolution condemned the Kishinobu government for acting as a tool for US and British imperialists to carry out aggression under the name of the United Nations. The resolution demanded that the Kishinobu government immediately stop its despicable acts of helping the US and British aggressors and betraying the Japanese people and the people of Asia, and take action to urge the US and Britain to immediately withdraw their invading troops from the Middle East.

　　The congress has sent representatives to the US and British embassies in Japan and the Japanese government to submit letters of protest against the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan.

　　The congress began on the 25th to discuss the political report of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party made by Nozaka Sanzo, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. Many representatives of local party organizations participated in the discussion, which was carried out under the sign of further strengthening and uniting the party ranks in the struggle for peace, for national independence and democracy, and for the people's happy life.

　　On the 25th, eavesdropping devices were discovered at the venue. This illegal act aroused great indignation among the delegates attending the congress, and they sent representatives to protest to the Japanese police agency.

    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本共产党第七次代表大会24日继续举行全体会议。
    大会讨论了政治报告。讨论的要点包括：战后日本资本主义的特点、美日垄断资本的政策、日本帝国主义的复活与屈从美国、和平共存和战争威胁等问题。
    在24日的会议上，有十九位代表发言。接着苏联共产党代表团团长米丁致贺词。米丁代表苏联共产党中央、全体共产党员和苏联人民向日本共产党第七次代表大会、日本共产党员和日本劳动人民致热烈的兄弟般的祝贺，并祝代表大会成功。
    米丁表示相信，日本共产党第七次代表大会将有助于吸引和动员日本人民的一切力量，同世界各国人民一道坚决反对在这些日子笼罩着世界的新的严重的战争威胁。米丁说，在当前情况下，这是一项最重要而刻不容缓的任务。
    接着，米丁宣读了苏共中央给日共第七次代表大会的贺词。贺词说：苏联共产党中央委员会向日本共产党第七次代表大会和日本全体共产党员致以真诚的兄弟般的敬礼。
    贺词指出：日本共产党第七次代表大会是在这样的情况下举行的，即：国际工人运动的高涨，世界共产主义运动在同修正主义进行不调和的斗争中已经在马克思列宁主义的思想基础上进一步加强团结。
    贺词说：日本共产党积极地参加这个斗争。它在建党以来的三十六年多中，始终不渝地为日本工人阶级和全体劳动人民的利益，为和平、民主和社会进步进行英勇的斗争；它的活动遵循着伟大的马克思列宁主义学说。它同日本一切进步力量一道积极争取巩固国际和平、反对新战争危险、争取祖国的完全民族独立以及争取同苏联、中华人民共和国和其他爱好和平的国家建立友好关系。
    贺词说：苏联人民对日本工人阶级争取和平、争取禁止原子武器和氢武器的斗争评价很高。苏日两国人民和东方其他国家爱好和平的人民之间的友谊以及经济和文化合作的加强是亚洲和平的最好保证。
    贺词说：苏联共产党中央委员会祝日本共产党在完成它所面临的任务、在进一步加强党的队伍在思想上和组织上的团结以及在它同劳动群众的联系方面取得新的成就。
    苏联共产党人的祝贺博得全场暴风雨般的掌声。
    接着，会上宣读了印度尼西亚共产党、意大利共产党、波兰统一工人党和其他兄弟共产党的贺词，这些贺词都受到代表大会代表们的热烈欢迎。
    日本共产党发言人24日在记者招待会上宣布了日共“七大”通过的抗议美英帝国主义者侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的决议。决议指出，美英军队在黎巴嫩和约旦的行动显然是干涉这些国家内政的侵略行动，同时是引起战争的挑衅行为。美英帝国主义者的意图是破坏全阿拉伯人民对和平与独立的要求和斗争，实现它统治世界的野心。
    决议说，日共“七大”和日本全体人民严厉谴责美英两国的侵略行为，并且要求两国立刻从黎巴嫩和约旦撤兵，同时对伊拉克、黎巴嫩、约旦以及阿拉伯各国人民的英勇斗争表示敬意和热烈的支持。
    决议谴责了岸信介政府充当美英帝国主义者利用联合国名义进行侵略的工具的行为。决议要求岸信介政府立即停止帮助美英侵略者和背叛日本人民以及亚洲人民的卑劣行为，并且采取行动促使美英两国立即从中近东撤出侵略军队。
    大会已经派出代表到美英两国驻日本大使馆和日本政府提出反对美英两国侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的抗议书。
    代表大会25日开始讨论日共中央第一书记野坂参三所作的日本共产党中央委员会的政治报告。参加讨论的有许多地方党组织的代表，这次讨论是在党的队伍在为和平、为国家独立和民主、为人民的美好生活而进行的斗争中进一步加强和团结的标志下进行的。
    25日在会场上发现了偷听设备。这种非法的勾当使参加大会的代表十分愤慨，他们派遣代表向日本警察厅提出抗议。
