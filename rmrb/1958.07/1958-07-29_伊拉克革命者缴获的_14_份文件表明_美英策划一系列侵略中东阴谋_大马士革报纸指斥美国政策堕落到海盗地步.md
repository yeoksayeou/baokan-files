Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 27th. According to a report in today's "Al-Ahram" in Cairo, secret documents seized by Iraqi revolutionaries in Baghdad show that former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said told Turkish Prime Minister Menderes that Turkey should launch a surprise attack on Syria. The United States and Britain had agreed to this action and guaranteed that Israeli forces would provide effective assistance.

According to "Al-Ahram," Iraqi revolutionaries seized a total of fourteen important documents, which will be published during the trial of Iraqi traitors for their crimes against the Iraqi people.

Other documents show that former Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamali actively served the United States. His American wife often went to the U.S. intelligence agency in Baghdad to report on daily events. She also reported on who the United States could trust.

The documents also mentioned Iraq's conspiracy to incorporate Syria into Iraq in exchange for agreeing to hand over Palestine to Israel; the documents also mentioned a plan to resettle Palestinian refugees in the desert regions of Iraq.

Some documents concern the British military occupation of the Buraimi Oasis, an oil-rich area on the Persian Gulf coast where the borders of Saudi Arabia and the British-controlled Sultanate of Muscat were undefined in the past. Britain forcibly occupied this area by force in October 1955. Other documents show that previous Iraqi governments agreed to the continued occupation of the Persian Gulf region by British troops in order to separate Yemen and Saudi Arabia from the rest of the Arab countries.

The documents also explain how the Iraqi traitors maintained their fascist regime.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 27th. Most newspapers here published editorials on the 27th condemning a secret document discovered in Baghdad detailing an American conspiracy to undermine and isolate the United Arab Republic and invade the people of the Middle East.

"Al-Nour" said that the document shows what we have said before, "The United States has always been and remains the most vicious enemy of Arab nationalism and the head of the worldwide imperialist system."

"Al-Manar" said, "The document irrefutably proves that the United States is determined to strike at the awakening of the Arab nation, undermine Arab unity, and place Arabs under the yoke of oppression, humiliation, and enslavement in order to turn them into compliant tools subject to the orders of imperialism." The newspaper said that this American policy based on deception, enticement, and distortion stands in stark contrast to the Soviet Union's policy of supporting the Arabs in freeing themselves from the shackles of imperialism and seeking liberation. The newspaper said, congratulating the Soviet Union on gaining more and more friends and supporters.

"Al-Ayam" said, "The document proves that American policy has degenerated to the point of piracy, and what the United States will receive is hatred, indignation, contempt, and scorn."

"Al-Baghdad" called on the Arab people to be vigilant because the document exposed the imperialist policy of the United States and its attempts to disintegrate Arab unity and undermine Arab nationalism.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 28th. According to a Middle East News Agency report from Baghdad on the 27th, the Iraqi Republic authorities discovered a secret arsenal established by the Said regime in an area close to the Syrian border. It is reported that the overthrown Said regime was preparing to use the arms hidden there to arm saboteurs and send them into the United Arab Republic to create disturbances.

    伊拉克革命者缴获的14份文件表明
    美英策划一系列侵略中东阴谋
    大马士革报纸指斥美国政策堕落到海盗地步
    新华社开罗27日电　据开罗“金字塔报”今天报道，伊拉克革命者在巴格达缴获的秘密文件表明，前伊拉克王朝首相努里·赛义德曾经告诉土耳其总理曼德列斯说，土耳其应当突然袭击叙利亚。美英两国已经同意这一行动，并且保证以色列军队给予有效的援助。
    据“金字塔报”报道，伊拉克革命者一共缴获了十四份重要文件，这些文件将在审判伊拉克的卖国贼反对伊拉克人民的罪行时公布。
    其他文件表明，前伊拉克王朝的外交大臣贾马利曾经积极为美国服务。他的美国妻子常常到巴格达的美国情报机构去报告每天发生的事件。她还报告那些人是美国可以信赖的。
    文件当中还提到了伊拉克企图以同意把巴勒斯坦交给以色列作为交换条件以便实现把叙利亚并入伊拉克的阴谋；文件还提到了使巴勒斯坦难民重新定居在伊拉克的沙漠地区的计划。
    有的文件是关于英国军队占领布赖米绿洲的问题的，这片盛产石油的地区位于波斯湾沿岸，过去，沙特阿拉伯和英国控制的马斯喀特酋长国在这里的疆界没有确定，英国在1955年10月就曾经以武力强行侵占这片地区。还有的文件表明以前的几届伊拉克政府同意英国军队继续占领波斯湾地区，以便使也门和沙特阿拉伯同其余的阿拉伯国家分割开来。
    文件还说明了伊拉克的卖国贼怎样维持他们的法西斯政权。
    新华社大马士革27日电　这里的大多数报纸在27日都发表社论，谴责在巴格达发现的美国策划破坏、孤立阿拉伯联合共和国和侵略中东人民阴谋的一份密件。
    “光明报”说，这个文件表明了我们以前所说的话，“美国一直是而且仍然是阿拉伯民族主义的最凶恶敌人和全世界帝国主义制度的魁首”。
    “灯塔报”说，“文件无可争辩地证明了美国决心打击阿拉伯民族的觉醒，破坏阿拉伯的团结，并且为了要把阿拉伯人变为服从帝国主义命令的顺从工具而把阿拉伯人置于受压迫、受侮辱和受奴役的桎梏之中”。这家报纸说，美国这种以欺骗、诱惑和歪曲为基础的政策和苏联的支持阿拉伯人摆脱帝国主义束缚和谋求解放的政策形成了鲜明的对照。这家报纸说，祝贺苏联得到愈来愈多的朋友和支持者。
    “旷野报”说，“文件证明美国的政策已经堕落到海盗的地步，美国将得到的是憎恨、愤慨、卑视和蔑视。”
    “巴格达报”号召阿拉伯人警惕起来，因为文件暴露了美国的帝国主义政策和瓦解阿拉伯团结和破坏阿拉伯民族主义的企图。
    新华社开罗28日电　据中东通讯社巴格达27日消息：伊拉克共和国当局在接近叙利亚边界的地区发现了一座赛义德政权所建立的秘密军火库。据报道，已经被推翻的赛义德政权是准备用藏在那里的军火来武装破坏分子，并且使他们潜入阿拉伯联合共和国制造骚乱的。
