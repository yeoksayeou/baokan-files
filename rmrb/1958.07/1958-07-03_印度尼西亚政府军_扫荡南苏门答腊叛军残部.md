Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 2nd: According to a report by Antara News Agency today, government troops in South Sumatra are continuing to sweep through the remaining elements of the Nawiwi rebel group. Several of his guards have already surrendered to government forces.

Nawiwi was formerly the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Second Military Region. Because of his involvement in the Lubis plot, the Army Chief of Staff ordered his removal from military duties at the end of April and ordered his arrest. After escaping from Palembang, he continued to carry out rebel activities in South Sumatra. On June 26, Nawiwi and his partners, pursued by government troops, fled to Sibulat. After looting in Sibulat, these rebels continued to flee towards the coastal city of Mukomuko.

Meanwhile, Antara News Agency also reported today that rebel activities had occurred in the Toraja area in northern South Sulawesi. Troops under the command of the South and Southeast Sulawesi Defense Region Command are taking military action against the rebels.

It is reported that more than a month ago, some military personnel and government officials there requested the separate establishment of a Toraja Military Region and the establishment of a province not under the jurisdiction of Sulawesi Province. After receiving this request, the Army Chief of Staff stated that any requests made in the form of an ultimatum could not be agreed to.

Subsequently, battles occurred in Magali and Lenggidi in the Toraja area.

Antara News Agency said that as of June 25, the local situation had eased, and many government employees who had resigned had returned to their posts. Military authorities are continuing to take measures to quell the incident.

    印度尼西亚政府军
    扫荡南苏门答腊叛军残部
    新华社雅加达2日电　据安塔拉通讯社今天报道，南苏门答腊的政府军正在继续扫荡纳瓦威叛乱集团的残余分子。他的卫兵有几个已经向政府军投降。
    纳瓦威以前是第二军区副参谋长，由于他参与卢比斯的阴谋，陆军参谋长在4月底下令解除他的军职，并且下令加以逮捕。他从巨港逃走以后还一直在南苏门答腊进行叛乱活动。6月26日，纳瓦威和他的伙伴在政府军的追击下逃到实布拉特。这些叛乱分子在实布拉特抢劫以后又继续向海岸城市姆科姆科方面逃窜。
    同时，安塔拉通讯社今天还报道，在南苏拉威西的北部的多拉查地区曾经发生叛乱活动。南和东南苏拉威西防区司令部指挥下的军队正在对叛乱分子采取军事行动。
    据报道，在大约一个多月以前，那里的一些军人和政府官员曾经要求单独建立一个多拉查军区，并且建立一个不受苏拉威西省管辖的省份。陆军参谋长在接到这个要求以后表示，以最后通牒形式提出的任何要求都一概不能同意。
    其后，在多拉查地区的马加利和冷帝波发生了战斗。
    安塔拉通讯社说，到6月25日为止，当地局势已经缓和，许多曾经离职的政府雇员都已回去。军事当局正在继续采取措施来平息这次事件。
