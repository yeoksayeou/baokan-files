Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 13th: Hou Linzhou, the First Secretary of the CCP Sanming County Committee in Fujian Province, with the help of workers at the Jigu Iron Plant, has smelted iron of considerably high quality using weathered limonite.

There are many weathered limonite deposits in various parts of Fujian, with one deposit alone in Sanming County having proven reserves of over 200,000 tons. According to testing, this iron ore contains more than 40% iron. However, these resources were not utilized in the past. Recently, after a surge in the vigorous development of the iron and steel industry in various parts of the province, Hou Linzhou thought: limonite is iron ore, so how can it not be used to smelt iron? He put forward his ideas and researched them with technicians experienced in iron smelting. The technicians all believed that limonite contained a lot of tin dioxide, and at the same time, the temperature of the native furnaces was low, so they were not sure it could be smelted into iron. Later, the county party committee held a symposium to specifically study the trial smelting methods. Hou Linzhou proposed using limestone to neutralize the tin dioxide in the limonite for testing. The workers at the Jigu Iron Plant followed his suggestion and conducted three furnaces of testing on July 2nd. The iron water that flowed out increased from furnace to furnace. At this time, the iron smelting technicians who originally thought that iron could not be smelted with weathered limonite were all convinced.

### 县委书记炼铁  风化褐铁矿出头了

    县委书记炼铁
    风化褐铁矿出头了
    新华社福州13日电　中共福建省三明县委第一书记侯林舟在吉古铁厂工人的帮助下，用风化褐铁矿炼出了质量相当高的铁。
    福建各地都有很多风化了的褐铁矿，仅三明县已找到的一处储量就有二十万吨以上。据化验，这种铁矿石含铁量在40％以上。但是这些资源过去没有利用。最近省内各地掀起大办钢铁工业的热潮以后，侯林舟想：褐铁矿既是铁矿，怎么不能炼铁呢？他把自己的想法提出同有炼铁经验的技术人员进行研究，技术人员都认为褐铁矿内二氧化锡成分很多，同时土炉子的温度低，没有把握把它炼出铁来。后来县委召开了一次座谈会，专门研究试炼方法，侯林舟提议用石灰石去中和褐铁矿内的二氧化锡，进行试验。吉古铁厂的工人按照他的建议，在7月2日进行了三炉的试验，结果流出的铁水一炉比一炉多。这时，原来认为用风化褐铁矿炼不出铁的炼铁技术员，都心服了。
