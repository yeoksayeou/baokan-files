Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 23rd: The General Secretary of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation, Jono, warned the United States on the evening of the 22nd that if the United States does not stop its interference in the Middle East, the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation will have to order its 2.6 million members to take further action.

Speaking at the seventh anniversary celebration of the Indonesian Oil Workers' Union, Jono also said that Indonesian dockworkers are prepared to blacklist and boycott American ships, and film industry workers are also prepared to boycott the screening of American films. He called on the Indonesian working class and people to join the working class and people of the world in combating and thwarting the Anglo-American aggression in the Middle East.

Jono said that the only way to resolve the Middle East crisis and avoid world war is for the United States and the United Kingdom to withdraw their troops from the Middle East and let the Arab people solve their own internal affairs. He said that if the United States and the United Kingdom continue to refuse to listen to reason and act arbitrarily, the people of the world will replace their protests with practical actions.

The General Secretary of the Indonesian Oil Workers' Union, Sidumeiyang, said in his speech that the Anglo-American aggression in the Middle East has a strong smell of oil.
The current dispatch of troops by the United States and the United Kingdom to invade Lebanon and Jordan is precisely the use of the excuse that was once put forward in Indonesia.

The Indonesian Oil Workers' Union passed a resolution at this anniversary meeting, representing 35,000 oil workers, condemning the Anglo-American aggression and demanding that the United States and the United Kingdom immediately withdraw their troops from the Middle East.

The Indonesian Oil Workers' Union is a member of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, July 24th: The Trade Union Congress (Burma) issued a statement on the 22nd protesting the US military occupation of Lebanon and demanding that the United States withdraw its troops from Lebanon.

The statement said that the landing of US troops in Lebanon is an act of great powers interfering in the internal affairs of small countries.

The statement pointed out that the US military intervention in Lebanon endangers world peace.

    印度尼西亚和缅甸工会组织
    警告美英立即滚出中东
    据新华社雅加达23日电　全印度尼西亚中央职工会总书记约诺22日晚上警告美国说，美国如果不停止它在中东的干涉行动，全印度尼西亚中央职工会将不得不命令它的二百六十万会员采取进一步行动。
    约诺在印度尼西亚石油工人工会成立七周年纪念大会上发表演讲时还说，印度尼西亚码头工人已经准备把美国船只列入黑名单加以抵制，电影业工人也准备抵制放映美国影片。他号召印度尼西亚工人阶级和人民同全世界工人阶级和人民一起打击和挫败美英在中东的侵略行动。
    约诺说，解决中东危机和避免世界大战的唯一出路是美国和英国从中东撤出它们的军队，由阿拉伯人民自己解决他们的内部事务。他说，如果美国和英国仍然拒绝听从道理而一意孤行，全世界人民将以实际行动来代替他们的抗议活动。
    印度尼西亚石油工人工会总书记西杜美仰在讲话中说，美英在中东的侵略行动有浓厚的石油气味。
    现在美英派兵侵入黎巴嫩和约旦，正是沿用在印度尼西亚曾经提出过的借口。
    印度尼西亚石油工人工会在这个纪念大会上通过一项决议，代表三万五千名石油工人谴责美英的侵略行动，并且要求美英立即从中东撤出它们的军队。
    印度尼西亚石油工人工会是全印度尼西亚中央职工会的会员。
    据新华社仰光24日电　工会大会（缅甸）在22日发表声明，抗议美军侵占黎巴嫩，并且要求美国从黎巴嫩撤出它的军队。
    声明说，美军在黎巴嫩登陆是大国干涉小国内政的行为。
    声明指出，美国对黎巴嫩的军事干涉危及世界和平。
