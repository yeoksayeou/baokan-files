		Admitting Defeat
		Zhu Cheng, Longshan Agricultural Cooperative, Jiande, Zhejiang

	The morning of the second day after being transferred, the sun had just barely shown its face when I went up the mountain to carry sod fertilizer to the fields. There were men and women among the cooperative members, and I thought to myself: although I have never done formal labor before, I certainly won't be behind these women.
	When I arrived at the construction site, piles of sod fertilizer looked like small hillocks. The cooperative members began to carry them according to the group contract regulations. I was in a group with the daughter-in-law of my landlord, Sister-in-law Quan, and we were responsible for carrying a small hillock – a thousand loads of fertilizer for two mu of land. I said, "Sister-in-law Quan! You dig the fertilizer, and I'll carry it!" "You dig, and I'll carry." She pouted her mouth, looking like she was a little unconvinced.
	The carrying began. Little Zhang dug two loads at a time, fairly and reasonably filling them the same amount. Sister-in-law Quan and I each carried a load to the corner of the field. On the way to the third trip, her straw sandals broke, and she stopped. I had just carried the mud to the field and poured it out. I took out a handkerchief from my pocket and wiped the sweat beads that popped out on my forehead. "Comrade Zhu! Take a break!" I quickly put down the handkerchief, turned around, and saw her barefoot, her shoulders high and low as she hurried up, walking faster than me.
	Four loads, six loads, eight loads... We continued to carry, one in front of the other. My rapid nasal sound became louder and louder—it was simply difficult to even get a breath of air.
	Ten o'clock arrived, and the small team leader blew the whistle for a break. "Comrade Zhu, take a rest!" Her high-pitched voice reached my ears again.
	After the break, carrying the sod fertilizer continued. My shoulders ached uncomfortably. I exerted all my strength and continued load after load, but as soon as the shoulders were put up, I wanted to switch them... And Sister-in-law Quan's speed became faster and faster, and she had already carried three more loads than me. A hundred or so pounds of sod mud, placed on her shoulders, she carried it as if she were delivering food to her husband in the fields, without a care in the world.
	The sun was at its zenith, and the small team leader blew the whistle for a break. We walked to the door, and Mom—four children in the house all rushed to Sister-in-law Quan, eleven years old, nine years old, six years old... Her mother-in-law heard the sound and brought another child for her to hold. She breastfed while using her fingers to wipe away the sand stuck to the soles of her feet.

专栏：下放干部的日记

    认输
    浙江建德龙山农业社    祝诚
    下放后第二天的早晨，太阳刚露出个脸儿来，我上山挑运草皮肥往田里送。社员中有男的、有女的，我心里盘算着：虽然我过去未曾正规劳动过，但比起这些妇女们总不会落后吧。
    到了工地，一堆堆的草皮肥好像一个个小山头，社员们根据分组包干的规定开始挑运，我和房东的儿媳全大嫂为一组，负责一个小山头的挑运任务——两亩田的千担肥。我说：“全大嫂！你扒肥，我来挑！”“你扒，我来挑。”她嘴巴一噘一噘的，看样子好像有些不服气。
    挑运开始了，小张一次扒两担公平合理的扒得一样满，我和全大嫂各挑一担往田角上送。到了第三趟的途中，她草鞋坏了停下来。我刚挑到田头倒好了泥，从袋里摸出手帕，揩擦着脸额上冒出的汗珠。“祝同志！你歇歇力吧！”我连忙放起手帕，转过头，见她赤着双脚，肩膀一高一低地赶了上来，走的比我还快。
    四担、六担、八担……我俩一前一后，挑运还是继续着，我急促的鼻声越来越大——简直连换口空气都感到困难了。
    十点钟到了，小队长吹起了休息的哨子。“祝同志，歇一下力吧！”她那尖细的声音又传到耳边。
    休息过了后，挑运草皮肥还是继续着，我两肩疼痛得难受，用尽力气，一担担地继续着，但两肩摆上去就想换肩……而全大嫂速度越来越快，她已经比我多挑三担了。百来斤一担的草皮泥，放在肩上，她像替丈夫送饭到田头似的毫不介意。
    太阳已到正中，小队长吹哨子休息，我们走到门口，妈——房子里四个小孩一齐向全大嫂拥上来，有十一岁的、九岁的、六岁的……她婆婆听到声音又抱来一个小孩递给她，她一边喂奶，一边用手指摸去脚底板上沾粘着的沙泥。
