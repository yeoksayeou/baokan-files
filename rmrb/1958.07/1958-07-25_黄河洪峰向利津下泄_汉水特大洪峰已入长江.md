Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 24th July: The Yellow River's ferocious extraordinary flood peak is about to pass Lijin, thanks to the heroic flood control army. This flood peak, which registered a flow rate of 21,000 cubic meters per second at Huayuankou, passed the final station known as the "tofu waist"—Jinan's Luokou station—on the afternoon of the 23rd.

In order to completely overcome the flood, the Shandong provincial flood control army along the river is engaged in a white-hot battle with the flood.

At 12:00 noon on the 23rd, the water level at Jinan's Luokou station reached its peak—32.09 meters, exceeding the guaranteed level by 1.09 meters, with a flow rate of 11,940 cubic meters per second. This water level lasted for four or five hours. At around 15:00, the water level at Luokou began to drop, and by 21:00, the water level had dropped to 32 meters. Currently, the flood peak is discharging downstream towards Lijin station, below Jinan. However, the river channel below Luokou has rarely experienced such a large flood. Before the flood peak enters the sea, the struggle remains intense.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 24th July: The Han River's extraordinary flood peak has been tamed and discharged into the Yangtze River thanks to the efforts of 20,000 people along the banks. On the 23rd, the water level from Xiangyang downstream generally fell, and the water level at many hydrological stations had fallen to about one meter below the warning level.

    黄河洪峰向利津下泄
    汉水特大洪峰已入长江
    据新华社济南24日电　黄河凶猛的特大洪峰在英雄的防汛大军面前已经快过利津了。这次花园口出现的二一○○○秒公方流量的洪峰，23日下午经过被称为“豆腐腰”的最后一站——济南市泺口站。
    为了最后全面地战胜洪水，山东省沿河防汛大军与洪水展开了白热化的战斗。
    23日中午十二时济南市泺口站水位达到了最高峰——三二·○九公尺，超过保证水位一·○九公尺，流量达一一九四○秒公方。这个水位一直持续了四、五小时。到十五时许，泺口水位开始回落，到二十一时水位已降到三十二公尺。目前洪峰已向济南以下利津站下泄。但是，泺口以下的河槽也很少经历过这样大的洪水，在洪峰入海以前，斗争仍然是紧张的。
    据新华社武汉24日电　汉水特大洪峰在沿岸两万人民的战斗下，已经驯服地泄入长江。23日，水位从中游襄阳以下普遍下跌，许多水文站的水位已下跌在警戒水位以下一公尺左右。
