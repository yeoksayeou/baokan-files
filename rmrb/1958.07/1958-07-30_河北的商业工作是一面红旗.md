Hebei's Commercial Work is a Red Flag

    Recently, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee organized a province-wide inspection of commercial work involving ten thousand people. On July 14th, they convened a province-wide summary and comparison rally to pledge their determination, raising the first red flag on the national commercial front.

    The reason Hebei Province's commercial work has been able to achieve such significant results in a short period is primarily because they placed commercial work under the absolute leadership and supervision of the Party, strengthened ideological and political work, and specifically resolved issues on the commercial front related to the relationship between industry and commerce, between commerce and agriculture, between commerce and consumers, between superiors and subordinates within the commercial sector, between different commercial departments, and between individuals and the collective. In other words, they resolved the relationships between people, i.e., the relations of production, thereby promoting the development of productive forces. During the rectification campaign, Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province firmly grasped the central link in commercial work, transforming the relationship between industry and commerce from past squabbling to collaboration, achieving "industry and commerce as one family, as close as brothers." The relationship between commerce and agriculture changed from passively ignoring supply shortages in the past, simply "spreading their hands," to actively seeking solutions in every possible way, achieving "logistics preceding the troops," becoming the "logistics department" and "grain providers" for production. The relationship between commerce and consumers has also undergone fundamental improvements. Consumers have praised salespersons, and residents have gone to stores with gongs and drums to offer congratulations, providing tea and meals and expressing concern for the well-being of sales personnel working in rural areas. "Homes for Travelers," "Friends of Customers," and "Model Stores" have sprung up everywhere. The harmonious relationship between superiors and subordinates is also unprecedented. The noble communist spirit of "one for all, all for one" has been established, resulting in a significant transformation of business operations.

    Strengthening the Party's leadership and ideological and political work is the decisive condition for doing all work well. Under any circumstances, abandoning or neglecting the Party's leadership and ideological and political work will lead to detachment from the masses and a loss of direction.

    With the Party's leadership and strong political and ideological work, there is a direction, a guarantee for doing good work. However, to do good work, specific methods are also needed. The former is "abstract," while the latter is "concrete." Focusing only on the "concrete" without the "abstract" will turn one into a pragmatist who loses direction, while focusing only on the "abstract" without the "concrete" will turn one into an armchair politician. The leaders of commercial work in Hebei Province firmly grasped the principle of combining the abstract with the concrete, paying attention to both the abstract and the concrete. Their specific method was to find models and plant red flags. They established fourteen red flags in the province, representing various aspects. Through these model examples, they convened on-site meetings, vigorously and comprehensively promoting these models. They also organized a massive inspection involving ten thousand people, accelerating the progress of work. This is a working method that combines general appeals with specific guidance, and leadership with the masses. They gathered and refined the opinions of the masses through model examples, and then popularized them, testing their correctness among the masses. Commercial workers in Hebei Province successfully applied this leadership method and working method, which has always been advocated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, in conjunction with the actual conditions of the province. Therefore, they were able to achieve tremendous results in a relatively short period.

    The experience of Hebei Province also proves once again that, under the leadership of the Party, commercial work can be improved quickly, effectively, and economically by fully mobilizing the masses and through the form of campaigns. In the past, some people believed that other work could involve campaigns, but commercial work could not because it was said that the characteristic of commercial work was passivity. For example, "You can't rob people if they don't sell things, and you can't drag people if they don't buy things!" They also said things like "When farming is busy, business is slow," so their conclusion was only to proceed step by step and remain passive forever. This commercial "exceptionalism" and "passivity theory" is a reflection of right-leaning conservative thinking and is completely unfounded. In today's situation of leaping industrial and agricultural production, where ten thousand horses are galloping and the tide is surging, if commercial work is content with the status quo and sticks to conventions, it will inevitably be thrown behind the rapidly advancing socialist wheels.

    The struggle between two opposing ideologies on the commercial front – advanced ideology and backward ideology – will exist for a long time. Specifically, will commerce act as a promoter or a drag on socialist construction? In business management, will it organize commodity circulation quickly, effectively, and economically, or slowly, poorly, and wastefully? In serving the broad masses, will it be wholehearted or halfhearted? In departmental collaboration, will it promote close collaboration with communist spirit or engage in mutual buck-passing? Only by strengthening political work and ideological work under the leadership of the Party, so that the former triumphs over the latter, can commercial work continue to advance.

    Hebei Province's commercial work has now undergone "acceptance inspection" after being inspected by Party committees at all levels. This is an effective method for assessing the quality of commercial work. This is also a major innovation in Hebei Province. On the one hand, it can place commercial work completely under the absolute leadership of the Party, which is a great impetus to the work of commercial departments; on the other hand, it also urges the Party committees themselves to lead commercial work. Facts have proved that doing a good job in commercial work can not only promote production and ensure supply, but also greatly promote other tasks.

    From a national perspective, there are many inventions and creations and very meaningful models on the commercial front. If they can all be systematically summarized and vigorously promoted like Hebei Province, and then compared, improved, and further promoted and popularized, wave after wave, constantly advancing and constantly leaping forward, then it is completely certain that the face of national commercial work can be rapidly changed. Having models without widespread promotion means that even the best models will not have much impact. Promoting without timely summary and improvement will cause experience and models to stop at their original level and not be able to improve further. Grasping models means moving from popularization to improvement, while promotion means moving from improvement to popularization; summarizing and comparing means further improvement, and then going to popularization again. Commercial workers across the country should learn from the bold creative spirit of commercial workers in Hebei Province and plant the red flag of commercial work in Hebei Province throughout the country!

### 河北的商业工作是一面红旗

    河北的商业工作是一面红旗
    最近，中共河北省委和人民委员会组织了对商业工作的万人大检查，并于7月14日召开了全省的商业工作总结评比誓师大会，树起了全国商业战线上的第一面红旗。
    河北省的商业工作所以能够在短短的时间内获得显著的成就，首先是由于他们把商业工作放在党的绝对领导和监督之下，加强思想政治工作，在商业战线上具体解决工商关系、商农关系、商业和消费者的关系、商业内部上下之间的关系、商业部门相互之间的关系、个人和集体的关系，等等，也就是解决人与人之间的关系，即生产关系，从而促进生产力的发展。河北省各级党委在整风运动中紧紧的抓住了商业工作的中心环节，使全省的工商关系由过去的扯皮变为协作，做到了“工商一家，亲如兄弟”。商农关系由过去的原材料供应不上时“两手一摊”的消极不管，变为千方百计积极想办法，做到“人马未动，粮草先行”，成为生产的“后勤部”、“解粮官”。商业和消费者的关系也有了根本改善，消费者纷纷表扬营业员，居民敲锣打鼓到商店登门祝贺，对下乡的营业人员送茶送饭、问饥问寒。到处出现了“旅客之家”、“顾客之友”、“模范商店”等等。上下级的关系融洽也是空前未有的。“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义高尚风格已经树立起来，因而业务面貌大为改观。
    加强党的领导和思想政治工作乃是做好一切工作的决定条件。在任何情况下，放弃或者忽略党的领导和思想政治工作，就会脱离群众，迷失方向。
    有了党的领导和坚强的政治工作、思想工作，即有了方向，是做好工作的保证，但要想做好工作还需要有具体办法。前者是“虚”，后者是“实”，只“实”不“虚”会成为迷失方向的实际家，而只“虚”不“实”也会成为空头政治家。河北省商业工作的领导者紧紧抓住了以虚带实、虚实并举的原则，既务虚、又务实，具体的办法就是找样板、插红旗，他们在全省树立了具有各方面代表性的十四面红旗。他们通过典型，召开现场会议，大张旗鼓的全面的推广了这些典型，又组织了声势浩大的万人大检查，加速了工作的进度。这就是一般号召和具体指导相结合，领导与群众相结合的工作方法，他们通过典型把群众的意见集中起来加以提高，然后又去普及推广，在群众中去考验是否正确。河北省商业工作者结合本省的实际成功地运用了党中央和毛泽东同志历来倡导的这一领导方法和工作方法，因此就能够在较短的时间内，作出了巨大的成绩。
    河北省的经验也再一次证明了商业工作在党的领导下，充分发动群众，通过运动的形式，是可以做到多快好省地改进工作的。过去有人认为，其它工作可以搞运动，商业工作不能搞运动，因为据说商业工作的特点是被动，比如：“人家不卖东西，你不能抢呀，人家不买东西，你不能拉呀！”又说什么“庄稼紧张，买卖消停”等，所以他们的结论只能是按部就班、永远被动。这种商业“特殊论”和“被动论”是右倾保守思想的反映，是毫无根据的。在今天万马奔腾、澎湃汹涌的工农业生产飞跃的形势下，商业工作如安于现状，墨守成规，必然会被抛到飞速前进的社会主义的车轮的后边。
    商业战线上的两种对立的思想——先进思想和落后思想的斗争是长期会存在的。具体的说，就是商业在社会主义建设中做促进派呢？还是做促退派呢？在经营管理上是多快好省地组织商品流通呢？还是少慢差费地组织商品流通呢？在为广大群众服务方面是全心全意呢？还是三心二意呢？在部门协作方面是发扬共产主义精神密切协作呢？还是相互扯皮呢？只有在党的领导下加强政治工作和思想工作，使前者战胜后者，商业工作才能不断前进。
    河北省的商业工作现在已经过了各级党的检查之后，实行“验收”，这是鉴定商业工作好坏的有效方法。这也是河北省的一大创举。它一方面可以使商业工作完全置于党的绝对领导之下，对商业部门的工作是一个极大的督促；另一方面也督促了党委本身去领导商业工作。事实证明，把商业工作抓好，不仅可以促进生产，保证供应，而且对其它各项工作也都有很大的推动作用。
    从全国来说，在商业战线上有许多的发明创造和很有意义的典型，如果都能像河北省这样有系统的总结和大力推广，然后评比提高，再去推广普及，一浪推一浪，不断前进，不断飞跃，那么，完全可以肯定，全国商业工作的面貌可以迅速改观。只有典型而不普遍推广，再好的典型也没有多大的作用。推广了而不及时总结提高，就会使经验、典型停止在原有水平上不能再提高。抓典型就是从普及到提高，推广又是从提高到普及；总结评比则是再提高，然后再去普及。全国的商业工作者应该学习河北省商业工作者的大胆创造精神，把河北省商业工作的红旗插遍全国！
