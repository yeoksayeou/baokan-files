Protest on the Firing Range (Shandong Kuai Shu)
Jiao Naiji

The July sun spits fire, the exercise field is target shooting, a piece of news came, the soldiers were angry to hear it.
(White) What news, so annoying?! The US and Britain invaded Jordan and Lebanon, sending troops to fight, human peace is threatened, innocent people are about to be massacred. Before the news was finished, Wang Dafa, a soldier, was furious. He gritted his teeth, and angrily replied:
"Eight years ago, the American devils invaded
Korea and fought, claiming to help Korea build the country, bombs, poison gas, and germ bombs, were scattered on the peaceful land, the great rivers and mountains turned into a sea of ​​fire, and innocent people were massacred. The flames of war on the Yalu River have just died down, why are they fighting again!?" The older Wang became more and more angry, and Xiao Hua came over to speak:
"Why? For the sake of invading other people's
land to make a fortune, the old dog Eisenhower is greedy, smells gasoline and drools, sees gold, silver, copper and iron and grins, hears grain and oil and bares his teeth! If you reach out to grab and you don't give it, he will offer a missile and say: He said, I am born to eat free food, what will I eat if you are not exploited? The bandits are rampant and unreasonable, relying entirely on war to make a fortune, you said that the mountains and rivers of Korea were burned, and you have not said that the people of Egypt were massacred! The facts of two years ago are repeated, how can people not be angry!" The soldiers protested one after another, the old squad leader, pulled Da Shuan straight by the side,
His face was iron blue and he didn't speak, with a "whoosh" sound he took out a pocket from his waist
It rattled straight down, pouring the pocket with the mouth down, rattling, a pile of stones scattered on the ground. He grabbed the stones and counted, one like one, two like two..., counted two nine one hundred and eighty. He weighed the stone and roared like thunder, calling out to the American and British devils to remember it:
"These pebbles come from Shangganling, one pebble is one of your heads
Guas, we met on the Korean battlefield, the undead can feel the big gun scars on your bodies! Shangganling is covered with your blood, your corpses are still feeding
Fish and shrimp in the Suez Canal, if you don’t accept the lesson of blood, you will hit the iron tower with an egg.” The old squad leader’s veins bulged and he stamped his feet, and the soldiers spoke together:
"Let's protest with practical actions, come, everyone get to your positions and shoot!" Wang Dafa shot three shots and three hits on the bullseye, Xiao Hua fired a row of bullets and opened up the "enemy plane"
Hua, the old squad leader picked up the grenade and charged, and the "enemy tank" became a dead turtle. The Katyusha cannons of our army on the opposite bank opened their
Mouth, the "enemy position" blossomed! The soldiers finished the exercise and gathered together, raising their arms and shouting to make a vow: Resolutely support Lebanon, and the American robbers immediately go home! Be sure to put out the flames of war

American devil dog robbers,
Conspiracy to start a war,
Sending troops to invade Arabia,
The people of the world are angry.
The people of the world issued a warning,
Be sure to put out the flames of war,
Invaders, get out,
Otherwise the people will not spare you. (Hao Naizhi, Air Force Unit stationed in Shantou)

    靶场上的抗议（山东快书）
    焦乃积七月的太阳喷火花，演习场上正打靶，一道消息传来了，战士听了怒气发。
  （白）什么消息，这么惹人生
  气？！美英侵略约旦和黎巴嫩，派去军队要把仗打，人类和平受威胁，无辜的人民要遭屠杀。这条消息没讲完，气坏了战士王大发，他钢牙咬的咯咯响，气呼呼的把话答：
  “八年前美国鬼侵略朝鲜把仗
  打，自称是帮助朝鲜兴国家，炸弹、毒气、细菌弹，朝着和平的土地往下撒，大好的江河变火海，无辜的人民遭屠杀。鸭绿江上的战火刚熄灭，为什么又要把仗打！？”老王越说越有气，小华过来把言发：
  “为什么？为的是侵占别人土
  地把财发，艾克老狗吃腥了嘴，闻到汽油涎水直哈拉，看到那金银铜铁就咧嘴，听到有粮食石油就呲牙！伸手来抢你不给，他就捧出那导弹把言发：他说是，俺生性就好吃飞食，你们不受剥削俺吃啥？强盗们横行霸道不讲理，全凭着战争把财发，你说了那朝鲜山河被燃烧，还没说那埃及的人民被屠杀！两年前的事实又重演，怎能叫人不气煞！”战士们纷纷提抗议，老班长，一旁把大拴拉的直卡
  察；他铁青着脸膛不开口，“嗖”的声从腰间取出个口袋
  直哗拉，倒提口袋嘴朝下，哗拉拉，有一堆石子撒地下。抓起石子他就数，一如一，二如二……，数了个二九一百八。他掂起石子如雷吼，叫了声美英鬼子你记住它：
  “这石头子来自上甘岭，一个石子就是你们的一个脑袋
  瓜，朝鲜战场上咱们见过面，没死的摸摸你们身上那些大枪
  疤！上甘岭洒满了你们的血，苏伊士运河你们的死尸还在喂
  鱼虾，血的教训不接受，硬拿着鸡蛋碰铁塔。”老班长青筋暴跳直跺脚，战士们一起把话发：
  “咱们用实际行动来抗议，来，各就各位来打靶！”王大发三枪三中靶心上，小华一排子弹把“敌机”打开
  花，老班长抱起手雷就冲锋，“敌坦克”变成死王八。对岸上我军喀秋莎大炮张开了
  咀，“敌人阵地”上边大开花！战士们演习完了集合起，振臂高呼把誓发：坚决支持黎巴嫩，美国强盗立即滚回家！定把战火扑灭掉
    美国鬼子狗强盗，
    阴谋要把战火烧，
    派兵侵略阿拉伯，
    世界人民愤怒了。
    世界人民发警告，
    定把战火扑灭掉，
    侵略军，快滚蛋，
    否则人民定不饶。（驻汕头空军部队　郝乃智）
