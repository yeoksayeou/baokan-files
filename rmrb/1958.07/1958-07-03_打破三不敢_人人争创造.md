Break the Three Dares Nots, Everyone Contends to Create
Beijing Institute of Aeronautics Student, Li Ji'an

In April, we fifth-year students at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, in conjunction with our graduation design, conducted research on the design of new aircraft engines. At the beginning, we had three "dares nots": "We dare not do what is not in the materials, we dare not do what we lack experience in, and we dare not do anything without the teacher's approval." Therefore, we stuck to some original materials and textbook experience, always thinking that what others had done was more perfect than our own, and we dared not think of creating anything. As a result, the engine we designed had a large frontal area, was heavy, inefficient, and consumed a lot of fuel. After the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the Party branch, we launched a major debate on design ideas. We realized that the main problem was not a lack of experience and materials, but a lack of ideological liberation. Someone suggested that we should surpass Britain with this engine, which immediately received a response from all teachers and students. Everyone contended to create, and suddenly more than a dozen new design proposals emerged on the leap forward stage. One major component used to weigh 40 kilograms when we copied it mechanically, but now it only weighs a little over ten kilograms. Each group compiled some performance indicators of the most advanced engines in capitalist countries, calculated detailed accounts, and set their own indicators. Now most of these indicators have exceeded those of the United States.

On the morning of "July 1st," we completed the design task of the engine's general layout. The school Party committee has accepted this general layout as a gift from us to "July 1st."

    打破三不敢　人人争创造
    北京航空学院学生　李纪安
    4月间，我们航空学院五年级的学生结合毕业设计，进行了新的飞机发动机的设计研究，开始我们有三不敢，“资料上没有的不敢干，经验不足的不敢干，老师不点头也不敢干”，因此我们就守住一些原有的资料和书本上的经验，总认为人家做过的比自己的完善，根本不敢想有所创造。结果设计出来的一种发动机，迎风面积大，重量大，效率低，消耗的燃料也多。中共八大二次会后，在党支部领导下，我们展开了设计思想大辩论。我们认识到主要问题不在缺乏经验和资料，而是思想没解放，有人提出就要在这台发动机上赶过英国，立即得到了全体师生的响应。人人争创造，一下子跃进台上就拥出了十几个新的设计方案。有一个主要部件过去照葫芦画瓢要四十公斤重量，而现在只十几斤重。各组统计了一些资本主义国家最先进的发动机性能指标，算了细账，订出了自己的指标，现在这些指标多数已经超过了美国。
    “七一”清晨，我们就完成了发动机总图的设计任务，学校党委已接受了这张总图，作为我们向“七一”的献礼。
