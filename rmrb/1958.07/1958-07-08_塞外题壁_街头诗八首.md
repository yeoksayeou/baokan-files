    Wall Inscriptions from Beyond the Great Wall
    ——Eight Street Poems	Tian Jian
    Wall Inscriptions from Beyond the Great Wall
    The red sun is the people,
    The green Great Wall is the trees,
    The stars on the ground are wells,
    Poetry and murals are the city.
      (Written on the wall of Shangdu County)
    Ode to Shangdu
    A leap-forward flower,
    Blooms in Shangdu County.
    Trees are the people of the grasslands,
    Trees are the General Line.
    Leaves are the grasslands,
    Flowers are water and electricity.
    This leap-forward flower,
    Is Shangdu County.
    (Written on the wall of Shangdu County)
    Ode to Water
    Water is a flower,
    The flower blooms, the grasslands rejoice.
    Water is a treasure,
    Shangdu's treasure is the best.
    Water is a song,
    Singing of a thousand years of joy.
        (Written at the Budong River Reservoir construction site)
    Ode to a Thousand Wells
    The steel drill is like an iron tree,
    The ice lamp is like a silver lamp. [Note]
    The iron tree is planted in the center of the well,
    The earth opens a thousand doors. [Note]
    Shangdu County: When digging springs in the severe winter, commune members used ice blocks to make lamps and hung them down the well to grab water.
    Ode to the Poplar Tree
    Enthusiasm goes far for thousands of miles,
    Poplar trees come to the grasslands;
    Railways become the Great Wall,
    Poplar trees are planted to the edge of the sky;
    Beyond the edge of the sky, there is another sky,
    A new piece of poplar trees is planted.
    Ode to Methane
    Methane comes to the grasslands,
    The grasslands have more vitality;
    Chengguan Cooperative has good skills,
    Calling methane to power the motor.
    Methane shines in the town,
    Like a brilliant plan;
    Comparing beauty with the moon,
    Competing with the wind and sand.
    (Written at Chengguan Town Cooperative)
    Ode to the Qingquan Cooperative
    A thousand wells of water,
    Billions of dans of sweet water.
    Carrying a thousand wells of water,
    To Jiangnan as soon as possible.
    Where is Jiangnan?
    The mountain of grain is Jiangnan.
    (Written on the wall of Qingquan Cooperative)
    A Gift to Gaowusu Township
    Ride on the wind, lead on the water,
    Shuiquan Ridge wants to generate electricity.
    Step over the grasslands,
    Two steps to Jiangnan,
    Three steps to the seaside,
    We will scare the United States of America!
    (Written on the wall of Gaowusu Township)

    塞外题壁
    ——街头诗八首	田间
    塞外题壁
    红的太阳是人，
    绿的长城是树，
    满地星是水井，
    诗和壁画是城。
      （写在商都县城的墙壁上）
    商都赞
    一枝跃进花，
    开在商都县。
    树是草原人，
    树是总路线。
    叶子是草原，
    花是水和电。
    这枝跃进花，
    就是商都县。
    （写在商都县城的墙壁上）
    水赞
    水是一枝花，
    花开草原乐。
    水是一件宝，
    商都宝最好。
    水是一支歌，
    唱的千年乐。
        （写在不冻河水库工地）
    千井赞
    钢钻好像是铁树，
    冰灯好像是银灯。〔注〕
    铁树栽在井中心，
    地球打开千道门。〔注〕
    商都县在严寒季节挖泉时，社员们用冰块做成灯，挂在井下，以便在井下抢水。
    杨树赞
    干劲远走千里，
    杨树来到草原；
    铁路结成长城，
    杨树栽到天边；
    天边还有个天，
    新栽杨树一片。
    沼气赞
    沼气来到草地，
    草地更有朝气；
    城关社好手艺，
    叫沼气上了电机。
    沼气照在城里，
    好似锦囊妙计；
    和月亮比美丽，
    和风砂争高低。
    （写在城关镇合作社）
    清泉社赞
    井水一千眼，
    甜水亿万担。
    担上千井水，
    早日下江南。
    江南是何处？
    粮山是江南。
    （写在清泉社的墙壁上）
    赠高勿素乡
    驾上风，引上水，
    水泉岭要发电。
    一步跨过草原，
    两步走到江南，
    三步奔到海边，
    要吓倒美利坚！
    （写在高勿素乡的墙壁上）
