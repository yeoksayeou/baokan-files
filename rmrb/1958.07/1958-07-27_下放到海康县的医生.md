Doctors Sent to Haikang County
By our reporter Cen Lidan

Late at night, Wu Yongtang, a female doctor from Zhongshan Medical College, and Feng Dingmian, a nurse, who had been sent to Meitian Agricultural Cooperative, Nanxing Township, Haikang County, Guangdong Province, were already asleep after a day of hard work. In their sleep, they suddenly heard someone knocking on the door, and knocking so urgently. They woke up in surprise and asked, "Who is it?"
　　"Comrade! My sister-in-law is very ill, please come and have a look..." The person spoke Leizhou dialect, which they could not understand, but seeing his panicked appearance, they estimated that the patient's condition might be critical, so they immediately put on their clothes, picked up their medical kits, and followed him.
　　The patient was Zuo Shengnang, a female member of the cooperative. When Wu Yongtang and Feng Dingmian went in, they saw her family crying around her. The patient's family told the doctor that Zuo Shengnang had suddenly had cold limbs and lost consciousness, which frightened the whole family. Wu Yongtang carefully diagnosed the patient and found that she was suffering from acute pneumonia, so she immediately gave her an emergency injection. After a while, Zuo Shengnang's condition improved. Her husband and mother-in-law urged the doctor to go back to rest, but Wu Yongtang was afraid that Zuo Shengnang's condition might change, so she decided to stay. When the patient's family urged her to rest, she pretended to sleep in front of the patient's bed. It was not until about 3:00 a.m. the next morning, when she saw that the patient's condition had not deteriorated, that she bid farewell and returned.
　　After that, Wu Yongtang visited Zuo Shengnang whenever she had time. More than ten days later, Zuo Shengnang fully recovered.
　　There are many examples of such loyal service to the peasants among the medical personnel sent to Haikang County. Wu Liyun, an obstetrician and gynecologist from Zhongshan Medical College, insisted on working for more than ten hours in a row after heavy physical labor in order to save a pregnant woman whose fetus had died in her womb and whose uterus had ruptured. After the patient had surgery, she lost too much blood, and she tried every means to mobilize others to donate blood, and finally found a blood source, saving the pregnant woman's dying life.
　　Gu Jiannai, a doctor sent to Meitian Cooperative, used to work in pathological anatomy at Zhongshan Medical College. Once, he went to reclaim wasteland with the production team, and it happened that the production team leader suffered from acute pneumonia. He sent someone to the town to buy penicillin injections to treat him. By the time the injections were bought back, it was already dark, and he remembered that a reaction test had to be performed before injecting this kind of injection, but he had never done this kind of test, and the other doctors were all at the reservoir construction site more than ten miles away from the wasteland. What to do? A sense of responsibility urged him, so he took a flashlight and ran to the reservoir construction site. After learning the technique of doing a reaction test from another doctor at the construction site, he ran back to the wasteland. It was already 2:00 a.m. This production team leader, under his treatment, finally turned the corner.
　　Yu Qingsheng, a young activist in Wushi Township, once used bricks and tiles from some dilapidated temples for other construction in April. A few days later, he suddenly fell ill, and his condition was very critical. Some superstitious people said that he was being "punished by the gods" and thought that he could not survive. The township cadres sent him to the county People's Hospital. Wang Tailai and Liu Zuyi, two doctors sent to the county, operated on him, and he quickly recovered and was discharged from the hospital. Now, the township cadres and Yu Qingsheng are very grateful when they talk about this matter. Yu Qingsheng said: "You not only saved my life, but also helped us break superstitions."
　　In the past three months, doctors Wang Tailai and Liu Zuyi have performed surgery on more than 30 patients in their spare time, and have also come up with many simple methods to solve the difficulties in the treatment process.

    下放到海康县的医生
    本报记者　岑荔丹
    深夜，下放到广东省海康县南兴乡梅田农业社的中山医学院女医生伍咏棠、护士冯定绵经过一天的辛勤劳动以后，已经入睡了。蒙胧中，忽听得外面有人敲门，而且敲得那样紧，她们惊醒过来，忙问：“谁呀？”
      “同志！我嫂嫂很不好，请你去看看……。”来人说的雷州话，她们听不清，可是，见到他惊惶失色的样子，估计病人的情况可能很危急，便马上穿衣，提起药箱就跟着他走。
    病人是这个社的女社员作生娘，伍咏棠、冯定绵走进去时，见到这一家大小正围着她哭泣。病人的家属告诉医生说，作生娘刚才忽然四肢冰冷，失去知觉，因此全家都惊惶起来。伍咏棠细心地替病人诊断，知道患的是急性肺炎，便立即进行急救注射。一会儿，作生娘的情况好转了，她的丈夫、婆婆劝医生回去休息，但是伍咏棠怕作生娘的病情有变化，就决定留下来，当病人家属催她休息时，她就伏在病人床前假睡一会。一直到次日早上三时许，她见病人情况没有再恶化，才告辞回去。
    这以后，伍咏棠一有空就去探望作生娘。十多天后，作生娘完全复原了。
    像这种忠心为农民服务的事例，在下放到海康县的医务人员中是很多的。中山医学院妇产科医生吴丽云，为了抢救一个胎死腹中、子宫破裂的产妇，在繁重的体力劳动以后，一连坚持工作十多小时。产妇施手术后失血过多，她想尽办法去动员别人输血，终于找到血源，挽救了产妇垂危的生命。
    下放到梅田社的医生古建鼐，在中山医学院是担任病理解剖工作的。一次，他随着生产队去开荒，碰巧生产队长患了急性肺炎，他派人到镇上购买青霉素针药回来救治。针药买回时，天已黑了，他才想起注射这种针药要进行反应试验，而自己从来没有作过这种试验，别的医生又都在离荒地十多里的水库工地上。怎么办呢？责任心在督促着他，他拿了电筒就拔脚向水库工地飞跑。在工地找到别的医生学习了作反应试验的技术后，飞跑回到荒地时，已是早上二时。这位生产队长在他的救治下，终于转危为安了。
    乌石乡一位青年积极分子余庆胜，4月间，曾经利用一些破烂庙宇的砖瓦来作其他建设。几天后，他忽然病倒了，病情很危急，一些迷信的群众都说他是“神报应”，认为他无法再活了。乡干部把他送到县人民医院去。下放到这个县的两位医生王泰来、刘祖贻替他动了手术，他很快就痊愈出院。现在，乡干部和余庆胜一谈起这件事就感激万分，余庆胜说：“你们不但救活了我，还帮助我们破除了迷信。”
    王泰来、刘祖贻两位医生，三个月来，利用劳动之余的时间，已为三十多个病人施行过手术，并且还因陋就简地想出许多办法，解决了治疗过程中的困难。
