Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, July 29th. The Hebei Province Commercial Work Leap Forward Competition and Swearing-in Conference, which concluded on the 26th, proposed that commercial work should support the "three marshals" rising to their posts, pave the way for "two advances," resolutely serve as the "logistics department" and "grain transport officer," strive for excellence, and strive to be the best in the country.

After half a year of hard work, the commercial departments of Hebei Province have basically changed the face of commercial work in the province. In the first half of the year, fourteen "red flags" of commercial work appeared in the province. At the conference, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee awarded these fourteen units with fourteen large red flags. Tianjin City, Shijiazhuang and Chengde Prefectures, which are advanced regions in commercial work, as well as thirty-seven counties and cities (including four districts of Tianjin City), and many advanced units and individuals, were awarded banners or certificates by the conference. The conference was accompanied by a Leap Forward Achievement Exhibition Hall, exhibiting advanced experiences, advanced deeds, and technological innovation examples of commercial work that emerged in various places in the first half of the year, for the representatives to visit and learn from.

At the meeting, Ma Li, member of the Standing Committee of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Governor, gave a report on the summary of the Leap Forward in commercial work in the first half of the year and future tasks. He pointed out that the current and future tasks of commercial work are: under the leadership of the Party, with the general line as the guiding principle and politics in command, relying on the masses, and cooperating with all parties, to carry out the large-scale purchase and sale of industrial and agricultural products and vigorously develop diversified economies; to do everything possible to fully meet the needs of rural areas for agricultural production materials; to actively carry out technological and cultural revolutions; to continue to stabilize the market, ensure the needs of the people's lives, run enterprises diligently and thriftily, increase accumulation, and strive to promote the leap forward development of industrial and agricultural production and the victorious realization of the leap forward plan proposed by the Provincial Party Committee.

Xie Xuegong, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a concluding speech at the closing of the conference. He called on all commercial workers to hold high the red flag of the general line, advance victoriously, and achieve an even greater leap forward.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, July 29th. The entire body of representatives attending the Hebei Province Commercial Work Leap Forward Competition and Swearing-in Conference launched a proposal to commercial employees in all provinces and cities across the country to carry out a comprehensive socialist competition.

The proposal put forward: 1. To take the general line as the guiding principle, with politics in command, constantly liberate thinking, and promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and daring to do. Resolutely listen to the Party and do everything possible to ensure the better realization of the Party Committee's instructions and resolutions.

2.  To fully support the leap forward development of industrial and agricultural production, ensuring supply, installation, repair, and use, taking full responsibility and providing comprehensive support. The sources of goods for various means of production should be based primarily on self-reliance, and strive for external assistance as a supplement. In addition, under the premise of doing a good job in purchasing and selling, based on the principle of mainly relying on indigenous methods, mainly small-scale, and mainly mass participation, continue to vigorously develop industry, so as to better serve industrial and agricultural production and the needs of the people's lives.

3.  To carry out large-scale purchase and sale of industrial and agricultural products, local and sideline products, and waste products.

4.  To vigorously carry out technological and cultural revolutions. Appropriately combine mechanical operation, semi-mechanical operation, and necessary manual labor. In the second half of this year, the majority of employees should be basically liberated from heavy manual labor. The majority of commercial personnel should strengthen the study of political theory, professional skills, and culture, and gradually cultivate a team of commercial workers who are both politically and professionally proficient, and both familiar with production and technology.

5.  To rationally adjust the commercial network, liberate labor, better facilitate the masses, and support production. This work should be completed thoroughly in the third quarter. In cities, the number of comprehensive stores should be appropriately increased; consignment points should be established in larger factories, schools, employee dormitories, and residential areas; and resident-run stores should be gradually established. In rural areas, in general, every township should have a cooperative (store), every cooperative should have a supply and marketing credit service department, and every village should have a retail point (personnel). Commercial and service personnel should gradually replace male labor with female labor and full labor with semi-labor.

6. To further improve service quality, earnestly implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and continuously improve management and administration. All retail units should be good at understanding customer psychology, acting as customer consultants, achieving three diligences (diligent mouth, diligent hands, diligent legs), four hearts (enthusiastic, patient, modest, meticulous), five satisfactions (satisfaction when coming, satisfaction when buying, satisfaction when leaving, satisfaction when using, satisfaction when thinking about it), and six familiarities (familiar with the origin, manufacture, specifications, uses, storage, and installation and repair of goods); at the same time, they should act as four personnel (policy propagandists, purchasing and sales promoters, technical instructors, and mass learners). Adopt various supply methods to facilitate the masses and actively deliver goods to their doorsteps.

The proposal also put forward: to further implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, to organize commodity circulation quickly, well, and economically, to reduce management links, and to eliminate roundabout transportation. Under the premise of correctly implementing policies, tap internal potential and expand capital accumulation.

In order to achieve the above requirements, the proposal put forward the need to universally carry out a "five comparisons" movement of comparing politics, comparing ideology, comparing drive, comparing measures, and comparing results, and promote the rapid development of the leap forward through methods such as uprooting white flags and planting red flags, holding on-site meetings, conducting major inspections, and evaluating and rewarding.

After receiving the proposal from commercial workers in Hebei Province on carrying out a comprehensive socialist competition, representatives from various regions attending the National Conference of Directors of Commercial Bureaus put forward specific conditions one after another, responding to this proposal.

Representatives from many regions proposed that they should work hard for two or three months to plant the fourteen red flags of Hebei all over their local areas.

    河北省商业工作者誓师
    坚决当好大跃进的“后勤部”
    倡议全国商业职工开展大竞赛
    本报保定29日电　26日闭幕的河北省商业工作跃进评比誓师大会，提出商业工作要支持“三个元帅”升帐，为“两个先行”开路，坚决当好“后勤部”“解粮官”，力争上游，力争全国第一。
    河北省商业部门经过半年苦战，基本上改变了全省商业工作的面貌。上半年全省出现了十四面商业工作的“红旗”。在大会上，中共河北省委和河北省人民委员会以十四面大红旗奖给这十四个单位。商业工作的先进地区——天津市和石家庄、承德两专区以及三十七个县、市（包括天津市的四个区），还有许多先进单位和个人，分别得到了大会授予的奖旗或奖状。大会附设有跃进成果展览馆，展览出各地上半年涌现出来的商业工作先进经验、先进事迹和技术革新事例，供代表们参观学习。
    会上，中共河北省委常委、副省长马力作了商业工作上半年跃进总结和今后任务的报告。他指出商业工作当前和今后的任务是：在党的领导下，以总路线为纲，以政治为统帅，依靠群众，同各方面协作，开展工农业产品的大购大销，大搞多种经济；千方百计地充分满足农村对农业生产资料的需要；积极进行技术革命和文化革命；继续稳定市场，保证人民生活需要，勤俭办企业，增加积累，为促进工农业生产的飞跃发展和胜利实现省委提出的跃进规划而奋斗。
    大会闭幕时，中共河北省委书记处书记解学恭作了总结发言。他号召全体商业工作者高高举起总路线红旗，乘胜前进，再来一个更大的跃进。
    据新华社保定29日电　出席河北省商业工作跃进评比誓师大会的全体代表，向全国各省市商业职工发起开展社会主义全面大竞赛的倡议。
  倡议提出：一、要以总路线为纲，以政治为统帅，不断解放思想，提倡敢想、敢说、敢作、敢为的共产主义风格。坚决听党的话，千方百计地保证党委指示、决议的更好实现。
    二、要全力支持工农业生产的飞跃发展，作到保供应、保安装、保修理、保使用，全面负责，一包到底。各种生产资料的货源，做到以自力更生为主，力争外援为辅。此外，还要在搞好购销工作的前提下，本着以土办法为主、以小型为主、以群众办为主的方针，继续大办工业，以便更好地为工农业生产、为人民生活需要服务。
    三、要开展工农业产品、土副产品和废品的大购大销。
    四、要大搞技术革命和文化革命。把机械操作、半机械操作和必要的手工劳动适当地结合起来。今年下半年使广大职工基本上从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来。广大商业人员要加强政治理论、业务和文化的学习，逐步培养起一支既通政治又通业务、既通生产又通技术的又红又专的商业工作人员队伍。
    五、要合理调整商业网，解放劳动力，更好地便利群众，支持生产。这项工作要在第三季度内彻底完成。在城市，要适当增加综合性商店；在较大工厂、学校、职工宿舍区和居民区建立代销点；逐步建立居民自办的商店。在农村，一般做到乡乡建社（店），社社有供销信用服务部，村村有零售点（员）。商业和服务业人员要逐步做到以妇女代替男劳力，以半劳力代替整劳力。
    六、要进一步提高服务质量，认真贯彻勤俭办企业的方针，不断改善经营管理。各零售单位要善于体会顾客心理，当好顾客参谋，做到三勤（嘴勤、手勤、腿勤），四心（热心、耐心、虚心、细心），五满意（来时满意、买时满意、走时满意、用时满意、想起来满意），六熟悉（熟悉商品的产地、制造、规格、用途、保管和安装修理）；同时要当好四员（政策宣传员、收购推销员、技术指导员和群众的学员）。采取各种便利群众的供应方法，主动送货上门。
    倡议还提出：进一步贯彻勤俭办企业的方针，多快好省地组织商品流转，减少经营环节，消灭迂回运输。在正确贯彻政策的前提下，挖掘内部潜力，扩大资金积累。
    为了实现以上要求，倡议提出要普遍开展比政治、比思想、比干劲、比措施、比效果的“五比”运动，通过拔白旗插红旗、开现场会、大检查和评比奖励等办法，推动跃进的迅速发展。
    出席全国商业厅局长会议的各地代表，接到河北省商业工作者关于开展社会主义全面大竞赛的倡议以后，纷纷提出了具体条件，响应这个倡议。
    许多地区的代表提出，要苦战二、三个月，把河北的十四面红旗插遍本地。
