Indigenous Pesticides are Highly Effective and Can Be Manufactured in Every Township and Commune

Sichuan Fully Promotes the Three-Tai County's Experience in Pesticide Production, Changshu's Townships and Communes Widely Prepare Pesticides, and the Fu'an Area Decides to Eliminate Major Pests Within Six Months

According to the Sichuan Daily, the small-scale indigenous pesticide processing plants established in more than 2,100 agricultural cooperatives in Santai County, Sichuan, have produced more than 800,000 catties of indigenous pesticides, which are showing great effectiveness in preventing and controlling cotton and rice pests and diseases. Many agricultural cooperatives' trial results have proved that indigenous pesticides have the advantages of costing little or no money, being highly effective, having easily accessible raw materials, being simple to manufacture, being able to control pests and fertilize fields, and being relatively safe for humans, animals, and plants.

The reason why indigenous pesticides have developed rapidly in Santai County is that the superstition that only chemical pesticides can control pests has been broken. In the past, cotton and rice pests and diseases in this county were relatively serious. The county party committee proposed that this year, pests should be controlled ten times, and no pests should be allowed to harm a single plant. However, although the chemical pesticides planned to be supplied by the commercial departments this year were five times greater than last year, they could still only guarantee the needs for two pest control treatments. While studying the general line of socialist construction, the Santai County Party Committee also proposed carrying out indigenous pest control methods to overcome the shortage of pesticides. Commercial cadres were finally liberated from the ideological constraints of "losing money" and "trouble," and further clarified the need to utilize indigenous methods. This laid the ideological foundation for large-scale indigenous pesticide production.

After breaking the superstition, the Santai County Party Committee required relevant departments to rely on the masses and use local materials in the trial production of indigenous pesticides, and put forward the slogan "Everyone contributes ideas, everyone kills insects" to mobilize all parties to participate in this work. Feng Degao, Chen Yijun, Yue Shihai and other cadres of the County Commercial Bureau, visited experienced old farmers, herbal medicine doctors, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, veterinarians, and pharmacists in Chinese medicine shops throughout the county. They held nine symposiums and absorbed the opinions of 36 herbal medicine doctors and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and summarized that 30 to 40 kinds of herbal medicines have insecticidal effects. Long Dekang, a member of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Anju District, introduced the fact that he used to soak bitter neem bark, Wudoyun, mountain hemp willow, and walnut leaves in manure pits to water cotton to kill insects. Commercial department cadres made these four kinds of wild plants into a four-component mixture. The test results showed that the insecticidal efficiency was over 90%.

After each indigenous pesticide was successfully tested, the relevant departments immediately used various forms to promote it. More than 2,100 agricultural cooperatives in the county quickly learned the technology of manufacturing indigenous pesticides. Recently, Sichuan Province held a provincial on-site meeting on indigenous pesticides in Santai County, requesting that 180,000 small-scale indigenous pesticide processing plants be established throughout the province before the end of July, and 4 billion catties of indigenous pesticides be produced this year, and together with chemical pesticides, launch a large-scale annihilation war against crop pests and diseases.

According to the Xinhua Daily, indigenous pesticides have shown great power in Changshu County, Jiangsu. Since the commercial departments of this county successfully trial-produced indigenous pesticides using wild plants, under the unified leadership and support of the local party committee, they have recently been fully promoted to all townships and agricultural cooperatives in the county and have been tested in large areas of fields, proving that the general killing rate is above 80%. As of June 24, all cotton fields in the county, covering an area of more than 56,000 mu, had been sprayed once for prevention and control, and the effect was very good.

In the large-area test, an important phenomenon was also discovered, that is, the efficacy of indigenous pesticides is similar to that of traditional Chinese medicine, and the medicinal properties are slow. Generally, it takes 24 to 30 hours after spraying to fully take effect, and the killed insects usually remain attached to the leaves and do not fall to the ground. These new situations and new discoveries provide richer experience for further improving the insecticidal rate of indigenous pesticides and doing a good job in prevention and control.

Now, a mass movement of preparing indigenous pesticides and widespread prevention and control has been launched in all townships and agricultural cooperatives. The agricultural cooperatives in Nanfeng Township have recently produced more than 42,000 catties of indigenous pesticide stock solution, and held a thousand-person oath-taking meeting, putting forward the slogan of "One day for preparation, two days for combat, one day for cleanup, and thoroughly eliminate pests and diseases." In just over two days, more than 5,300 mu of pests were controlled, and some agricultural cooperatives in Hupu Township have carried out comprehensive prevention and control with good results.

According to the Fujian Daily, the Fu'an Prefectural Committee of Fujian Province held a pest and disease prevention and control conference in Luoyuan from June 19 to 22, and decided to fight hard for half a year, mainly using indigenous methods to eliminate the main pests and diseases in the area, such as casebearers, tea caterpillars, and black spot disease.

During the meeting, the representatives watched a demonstration comparing the insecticidal efficacy of the indigenous pesticide—soda potash mixture—trial-produced by the Luoyuan County Commercial Bureau with wettable 666. The results proved that the indigenous pesticide had a high insecticidal efficiency and killed insects five minutes faster. This effectively shattered the superstitious views of the cadres present. Zheng Binghui, an expert in pest and disease prevention and control, said: Eliminating sweet potato black spot disease is a problem that has not been solved theoretically. I didn't even dare to think about it in the past, but Luoyuan solved it with indigenous methods.

At the meeting, representatives introduced 57 kinds of wild plants and indigenous pesticides with insecticidal effects. After scientific identification, 16 kinds can be promoted throughout the area. The meeting finally decided: to fight hard for half a year, the area will produce 6,600 tons of indigenous pesticides, with an average of six catties that can be sprayed per mu of field, and eliminate pests and diseases such as casebearers, weevils, large crickets, black smut, tea insects, tea caterpillars, scabies, and black spot disease this year, so as to create favorable conditions for ensuring a great leap forward in agriculture.

    土农药效率高　乡乡社社能制造
    四川全面推广三台县制药经验　常熟各乡社普遍配制农药　福安专区决定半年内消灭主要虫害
    据四川日报讯　四川三台县二千一百多个农业社普遍建立的小型土制农药加工厂，已经生产出八十多万斤土制农药，这批农药正在防治棉花、水稻病虫害中大显神通。许多农业社试用结果证明：土制农药的优点是花钱少或不花钱，效力大，原料易找，制造简单，既能治虫又能肥田，对人畜植物都比较安全。
    三台县土制农药能够迅速发展起来的原因，是破除了只有化学农药才能治虫的迷信。这个县前一向棉花和水稻病虫害都比较严重，县委提出今年要治十次虫，决不让害虫危害一株一苗。可是商业部门今年计划供应的化学农药虽然比去年大五倍，仍然只能保证治两次虫的需要。在学习社会主义建设总路线的同时，中共三台县委又提出了开展土法治虫，克服农药不足的号召。商业干部们终于从“赔本论”“麻烦论”的思想束缚中解放出来，进一步明确了要利用土法。这就打下大搞土制农药的思想基础。
    破除了迷信以后，中共三台县委要求有关部门在试制土农药中必须依靠群众，就地取材，并提出“人人献策，个个杀虫”的口号，发动各方面力量参与这一工作。县商业局干部冯德高、陈贻钧、岳仕海等，访遍了县内有经验的老农民、草药先生、中医、兽医、中药铺司药员。先后召开了九次座谈会，吸收了三十六位草药先生和中医的意见，总结出三、四十种草药有杀虫效果。安居区红星农业社社员龙德康介绍他过去用苦楝皮、五朵云、山麻柳、核桃叶四种放在粪坑里泡粪来淋棉花杀虫的事实。商业部门干部将这四种野生植物制成四合剂，试验结果，杀虫效率在90％以上。
    每一种土制农药试验成功后，有关部门立即利用各种形式加以推广，全县二千一百多个农业社很快就学会制造土农药的技术。最近，四川省在三台县举行了全省土制农药现场会议，要求在7月底以前，在全省兴办十八万个小型土制农药加工厂，今年制成四十亿斤土农药，和化学农药一道，向农作物病虫害展开大规模歼灭战。
    据新华日报讯　土农药已在江苏常熟县大显威风。这个县的商业部门自从利用野生植物试制土农药成功后，在当地党委统一领导和支持下，最近已向全县各乡、各农业社全面推广并经大面积田间试验，证明一般的杀虫率在80％以上。到6月24日止，全县已在五万六千多亩棉田中全面地进行了一次喷射防治，效果很好。
    在大面积试验中，还发现一个重要的现象，即土农药的药效和中药类似，药性较慢。一般在喷射后二十四到三十小时，才能充分见效，被杀死的虫子一般仍旧附在叶子上，并不落到地上来。这些新情况和新发现，对进一步提高土农药的杀虫率和搞好防治工作，提供了更丰富的经验。
    现在，各乡、各农业社已掀起了群众性的配制土农药和广泛防治运动。南丰乡各农业社最近已生产出土农药原液四万二千多斤，并召开了千人誓师大会，提出了“一天准备，二天战斗，一天扫尾，彻底消灭病虫害”的口号，仅在二天多的时间内，就防治了五千三百多亩的虫害，浒浦乡有些农业社已进行了全面防治，效果很好。
    据福建日报讯　福建省福安地委于6月19日至22日在罗源召开病虫害防治会议，决定苦战半年，以土办法为主消灭全区的负泥虫、茶毛虫、黑斑病等主要病虫害。
    会议中，代表们观看了罗源县商业局试制的土农药——梭钾剂和可湿性六六六杀虫效力试验比较的表演，结果证明土农药杀虫效率高，杀死虫的时间还快五分钟。这就有力地打破了到会干部的迷信观点。病虫害防治专家郑炳辉说：消灭番薯黑斑病，是理论上还没有解决的问题，我过去连想都不敢想，而罗源却用土办法解决了。
    会上，代表们介绍了五十七种有杀虫效力的野生植物和土农药，经科学鉴定，有十六种可在全区推广。会议最后决定：苦战半年全区生产土农药六千六百吨，平均每亩田可喷射六斤，在今年内消灭负泥虫、象鼻虫、大蟋蟀、黑穗病、茶虫、茶毛虫、?疡病、黑斑病等病虫害，为确保农业大跃进创造有利条件。
