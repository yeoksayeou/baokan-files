The first season of ramie has generally achieved good harvests.
Total output increased by 80% compared to last year.
(Our Dispatch) This year, China's ramie production has shown a new atmosphere, and the first crop has generally achieved good harvests in various regions.

This spring, the nationwide expanded ramie cultivation area has reached more than 480,000 mu, and it will continue to expand in the summer and autumn seasons. It is estimated that the national ramie planting area this year will be doubled compared to last year; the speed of development is faster than any previous year.

This year's estimated total output of the first crop of ramie increased by 80% compared to last year. Although the first season of ramie suffered several wind disasters, the vast number of cadres and the masses in the ramie areas overcame the disasters with soaring revolutionary vigor and still achieved a generally great harvest. In Hubei Province, the per-mu yield of the first crop of ramie from more than 340,000 mu of ramie fields increased by 100% compared to last year. In Hunan Province, the average per-mu yield of the first crop of ramie from 250,000 mu increased by 80% compared to last year. The output of the first crop of ramie in Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces has increased compared to last year.

More outstandingly, various regions have created records of high-yield ramie production. For example, in Yangxin County, Hubei Province, there were 22.31 mu with a per-mu yield of more than 1,000 jin. In Hongguang First Cooperative, 1.78 mu of ramie land achieved a per-mu yield of up to 1,325.8 jin. This is an unprecedented miracle in ramie production.

The widespread good harvest of the first crop of ramie this year is mainly due to the strengthening of leadership by party committees at all levels over ramie production and the full enthusiasm of the masses. Generally, the management of ramie fields was well-done last winter and this spring, with widespread increased fertilization and soil cultivation. For example, in Hunan Province, the area of winter base fertilizer application increased by 100% compared to previous years. In the past, the first crop of ramie was generally not cultivated, but this year, cultivation and topdressing were carried out two or three times, and pest control campaigns were launched in a timely manner. In Hubei Province, the enrichment and management of winter ramie fields have formed a movement. In Sichuan Province, fertilizer application last winter increased by 50% to 100% compared to previous years.

At present, various regions are actively grasping the field management of the second and third crops of ramie, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of ramie.

    头季苎麻普遍丰收
    总产量比去年增产八成
    本报讯　今年我国的苎麻生产出现了一片新的气象，各地头麻普遍获得丰收。
    今年春季全国扩大的苎麻面积已达四十八万多亩，夏秋两季还要继续扩大。预计今年全国苎麻的种植面积将比去年扩大一倍；发展速度之快，超过以往任何一年。
    今年预计头麻总产量比去年增产八成。头季苎麻虽然遭受几次风灾，但麻区广大干部和群众以冲天革命干劲，战胜了灾害，仍获得普遍大丰收。湖北省三十四万多亩麻田，头麻亩产比去年增产一倍。湖南省二十五万亩头麻平均亩产比去年增产八成。四川、广东、广西等省头麻产量均比去年增加。
    更突出的是各地创造了苎麻高额丰产的纪录。如湖北阳新县亩产千斤以上的有二十二点三一亩，红光一社一点七八亩麻地，头麻亩产高达一千三百二十五点八斤。是苎麻生产上从未有过的奇迹。
    今年头麻获得普遍丰收，主要是由于各级党委加强了对苎麻生产的领导，群众干劲十足。去冬今春一般对麻田管理都搞得好，普遍增施了肥，培了土。如湖南省冬施底肥的面积比往年增加一倍，过去头麻一般不中耕，今年普遍进行了中耕追肥二、三次，并及时地开展治虫运动。湖北省冬季苎麻田的培肥管理已形成运动。四川省去冬施肥要比往年增加五成到一倍。
    目前各地正积极抓二、三季麻的田间管理工作，力争苎麻全面丰收。
