    Lushan Sheep Farm Successfully Trials Xinjiang Fine Wool Sheep
    Development of Fine Wool Sheep in the South Has Great Prospects

    (Our report) The successful trial of raising Xinjiang fine wool sheep at the Lushan Sheep Farm in Jiangxi Province has created a good start for the development of fine wool sheep south of the Yangtze River. Historically, Jiangxi Province was not a province with the habit of raising sheep. Apart from raising a small number of goats, there were no sheep at all. In order to develop the sheep industry, the province introduced 450 Xinjiang fine wool sheep in 1955 and 1957 respectively, which were raised and bred by the Lushan Yunzhong Reclamation Farm.

    The Lushan Yunzhong Reclamation Farm is 1,400 meters above sea level, with an annual rainfall of about 2,000 mm, a temperature of 32-85 degrees (Fahrenheit), and a humidity of 43%-82% or more. After Xinjiang fine wool sheep came to Lushan, Jiangxi, which is warm, humid, and has a lot of rainfall, from the cold and dry Xinjiang, they have grown well after several years of trial breeding, and now there are more than 780 sheep. The original old sheep and the bred sheep are basically normal in terms of weight, wool length, fineness, and density. This new achievement powerfully proves that fine wool sheep can be developed in the high mountain areas south of the Yangtze River, where the climate is humid and there is a lot of rainfall.

    庐山羊场试养新疆细毛羊成功
    江南发展细毛羊很有前途
    本报讯　江西庐山羊场试养新疆细毛羊成功，为长江以南发展细毛羊创造了良好开端。江西省在历史上是一个没有养羊习惯的省，全省除养有少数山羊以外，根本没有绵羊。这个省为了发展养羊业，在1955和1957两年分别引进新疆细毛羊四百五十只，由庐山云中垦殖场饲养繁殖。
    庐山云中垦殖场海拔一千四百公尺，年降雨量二千公厘左右，温度三十二——八十五度（华氏），湿度43％—82％以上。新疆细毛羊从寒冷、干燥的新疆来到温暖、潮湿、降雨量多的江西庐山后，经过几年来的试养，生长情况良好，目前已发展到七百八十多只。原有的老羊和所繁殖的羊只，体重和羊毛的长度、细度、密度等，基本上都很正常。这一新的成就，有力的证明了在气候潮湿，降雨量多的长江以南的高山区是可以发展细毛羊的。
