Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch: Recently, the Guangdong public security organs, with the assistance of the masses, have successively cracked a batch of espionage cases, and four special agents, Su Zuji, Ren Huazai, Chen Guangyi, and Lin Qing, have been arrested.

　　Special agent Su Zuji was a murderer sent by the Hong Kong Chiang gang's intelligence agency to Guangdong, attempting to carry out sabotage. After Su joined the special agent organization in Hong Kong in 1956, he went to Taiwan in November 1957 for special agent technical training. In May of this year, he sneaked into Guangzhou from Hong Kong, and then sneaked into Lianjiangkou, Yingde County, attempting to blow up some railway bridges on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway. Just as he was attempting to collude with local bad elements to carry out sabotage activities, he was reported by the local people. When the public security organs arrested Su, they seized his contact documents on the spot.

　　Special agent Lin Qing was sent by the Chiang gang's intelligence agency to collect intelligence and carry out so-called "psychological warfare." Lin Qing was originally a crew member on a ship sailing between Shanwei and Hong Kong. In March of this year, he was recruited by special agents to join a special agent organization. He accepted the task assigned to him by the special agent agency to be responsible for transportation and liaison, collecting our military intelligence, etc. He also brought back a batch of reactionary leaflets and reactionary letters from the Hong Kong special agent agency to distribute and mail them to various parts of Guangdong.

　　Special agents Ren Huazai and Chen Guangyi were sent by the Chiang gang's intelligence agency to lead lurking counter-revolutionary elements to flee the country by sea. Ren Huazai was originally a Kuomintang soldier. He fled to Macau in the early days of liberation to join a special agent organization and was appointed by the special agent agency as the captain of the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army." He sneaked into Guangdong in 1950 and was arrested and sentenced to imprisonment. After his release from prison in 1956, his reactionary nature remained unchanged, and he extremely hated the people's government. He once conspired to assassinate our township and commune cadres. In May 1957, he colluded with three fellow villagers, including Zeng Youyuan, and fled to Macau, joining the Chiang gang's special agent organization again. In March of this year, he accepted a mission and sneaked into Guangzhou, attempting to lead lurking counter-revolutionary elements to flee to Macau.

　　Special agent Chen Guangyi joined the Chiang gang's special agent organization in January of this year and was a member of the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Action Team." In March of this year, after he sneaked into Jiangmen from Macau, he was arrested by our public security organs.
