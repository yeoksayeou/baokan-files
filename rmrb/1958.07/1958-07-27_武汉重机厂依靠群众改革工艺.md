Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant Relies on the Masses to Reform Technology

(Our dispatch) The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant closely relies on the broad masses of workers and staff, and reforms the technological regulations with the spirit of bold destruction and bold establishment, greatly mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the workers and staff.

In the past, the factory's technological regulations had too many rigid rules and were very lengthy. Even processing a single part required writing four or five pages to over a hundred pages of technology. At the same time, due to the low level of the technicians, the technological regulations were created in the office, and often had many errors, some of which directly led to production rejects. However, the workers had to waste a lot of time reading them every day. Due to the irrationality of the technological regulations, the processing time of parts was prolonged, resulting in work stoppages and wasting a lot of production time. The greater loss was the limitation of the workers' enthusiasm and creativity, and the restriction of the development of production.

During the rectification movement, the workers made many criticisms of the unreasonable technological regulations, and the technicians began to realize that the original method of creating technology was divorced from reality. However, at the beginning, they thought that the workers had a low level of education, and the mass line could not be taken in technology. Therefore, they still shut themselves in the office to revise, and the result was still many errors. Although some workshop technicians assigned special personnel to go to the workshop to revise the technology, because they did not mobilize the masses of workers, there were still many errors, and they could not solve the problem of technological errors even if they were busy from morning to night.

Later, the Party committee of Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, according to the instructions of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, decided to fully mobilize and rely on the masses of workers and staff to reform unreasonable rules and regulations. The Party committee decided that the technicians should change the original practice of only sitting in the office to create technology, go deep into the workshop, and solicit the opinions of the workers. Then, it organized the technicians to go to the workshop and held symposiums with workers and workshop cadres to widely solicit opinions on technology. Each workshop absorbed experienced veteran workers in production to participate in the preparation of technology. Liu Konghui, an old worker in the tool workshop, compiled the processing technology of fourteen parts in one night, and it was completely accurate. The technicians and veteran workers of the small and medium-sized parts department of the first processing workshop jointly compiled six typical technologies, saving 80% of the workload, and the average time for workers to read the technology was also saved by 75%. The factory leadership promptly promoted the experience of compiling these six typical technologies. The technicians and the workers re-compiled the technology of the entire factory.

The factory then further sent the technicians to the workshops to work with the workers and study technical problems together. In this way, the relationship between the technicians and the workers was greatly strengthened. The technology they wrote in the workshop was also more practical.

After reforming the technology, the enthusiasm of the workers in Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant has been unprecedentedly high. Since April, the factory's production plans have been completed very well.

    武汉重机厂依靠群众改革工艺
    本报讯　武汉重型机床厂紧密依靠职工群众，以大破大立的精神改革工艺规程，大大调动了职工的生产积极性。
    过去，这个厂的工艺规程，清规戒律过多，而且十分冗长。甚至加工一个零件，也要编写四、五页到一百多页的工艺。同时，由于工艺员水平不高，工艺规程又是坐在办公室里编出来的，往往有很多错误，有的直接导致生产废品。但是，工人们每天要浪费许多时间去看它。由于工艺规定的不合理，延长了零件的加工时间，产生窝工现象，也浪费了大量生产时间。更大的损失是限制了工人积极性、创造性的发挥，限制了生产的发展。
    整风运动中，工人们对不合理的工艺规程提出了许多批评，工艺人员开始认识到原来那种编工艺的方法脱离实际。但是，开始的时候，他们认为：工人文化水平低，在工艺上不能走群众路线。于是，仍然关起门来，在办公室里修改，结果错误仍然很多。有的车间工艺人员虽然抽专人下车间修改工艺，但是因为没有发动工人群众，仍然有不少错误，从早忙到晚也解决不了工艺差错的问题。
    后来，武汉重型机床厂的党委，根据中共湖北省委和武汉市委的指示，决定充分发动和依靠职工群众，改革不合理的规章制度。党委决定，工艺人员要改变原来只坐在办公室里编工艺的做法，深入车间，征求工人的意见。接着，组织工艺人员下车间，召开了有工人、车间干部参加的座谈会，广泛征求了对工艺的意见。各车间都吸收在生产上有经验的老工人参加编制工艺。工具车间老工人刘孔辉，在一个晚上就编了十四个零件的加工工艺，而且完全准确。第一加工车间中小件工部的工艺人员和老工人一起试编了六份典型工艺，节省了80％的工作量，工人看工艺的时间平均也节省了75％。工厂领导方面及时推广了编制这六份典型工艺的经验。工艺人员和工人们一起，重新编制了全厂的工艺。
    工厂接着进一步把工艺员下放到车间，和工人一起劳动，一起研究技术问题。这样，工艺员和工人的关系大大密切起来。他们在车间里编写的工艺，也切合实际了。
    武汉重型机床厂经过改革工艺，工人生产积极性空前高涨。4月份以来，这个厂的生产计划都完成得很好。
