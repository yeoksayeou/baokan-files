Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 4th: The Vietnam News Agency was authorized today to issue a statement regarding the recent condemnation by the Royal Government of Cambodia of South Vietnamese troops' invasion of Cambodian territory. The statement said: "The Royal Government of Cambodia, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, has consistently pursued a policy of peace and neutrality in order to consolidate Cambodia's independence and build a prosperous Cambodia. Like other peace-loving people around the world, the Vietnamese people warmly welcome this policy." The statement said: "However, the policy of the Kingdom of Cambodia is disliked by the U.S. imperialists, who have consistently attempted to subjugate other countries to their will. They have repeatedly used South Vietnamese troops to threaten Cambodia's borders, hoping to force the Royal Government of Cambodia to abandon its policy of peace and neutrality. The purpose of the American conspiracy is also to create hatred between nations, alienate the people of Vietnam and Cambodia, and create tension in Indochina and throughout Southeast Asia.

The statement said: "We condemn the aggressive and divisive acts of the U.S. imperialists, demand that the border disputes between South Vietnam and the Kingdom of Cambodia be resolved through peaceful negotiations between the parties concerned, and we hope to see the International Commissions in Cambodia and Vietnam help resolve this dispute."

The statement said: "We are convinced that the malicious conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists to threaten the independence of the Kingdom of Cambodia and its policy of peace and neutrality with armed forces and to create tension in Indochina and Southeast Asia will be condemned by the people of the world and will eventually be crushed."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 4th: The Indian "National Herald" published an editorial on the 3rd regarding the recent invasion of Cambodia's border by South Vietnamese troops, saying that "behind South Vietnam there is strong support from the United States and protection from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

    越南通讯社受权发表声明
    谴责美国利用南越威胁柬埔寨
    新华社河内4日电　越南通讯社今日就柬埔寨王国政府最近谴责南越军队侵犯柬埔寨领土的行为受权发表声明。声明说：“柬埔寨王国政府在西哈努克亲王的领导下一直奉行着和平中立的政策，以便巩固柬埔寨的独立和建立一个繁荣的柬埔寨。同世界上其他爱好和平的各国人民一样，越南人民热烈欢迎这项政策。”声明说：“但是，柬埔寨王国的政策是美帝国主义者所不喜欢的，美帝国主义者一贯企图使其他国家屈从于他们的意志。他们曾经多次利用南越军队来威胁柬埔寨的边境，希望这样来迫使柬埔寨王国政府放弃它的和平中立政策。美国阴谋的目的还在于在国家之间制造仇恨，离间越南和柬埔寨两国人民，同时在印度支那和整个东南亚制造紧张局势。
    声明说：“我们谴责美帝国主义者的侵略和离间行为，要求南越和柬埔寨王国之间的边境纠纷通过有关方面之间的和平谈判来解决，我们希望看到驻柬埔寨和越南的国际委员会帮助解决这个纠纷。”
    声明说：“我们确信，美帝国主义者企图用武装力量来威胁柬埔寨王国的独立和它的和平中立政策以及在印度支那和东南亚制造紧张局势的恶毒阴谋，将遭到全世界人民的谴责，最后一定被粉碎。”
    据新华社新德里4日电　印度“国民先驱报”3日就最近南越军队侵犯柬埔寨边境一事发表社论说，“在南越的背后有美国的有力支持，并且有东南亚条约组织的保护”。
