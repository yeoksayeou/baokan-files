Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Successive flood peaks have recently appeared in the Yangtze River, Han River, Yellow River, and Huai River tributaries.

　　Due to continuous rainfall in the upper reaches of the Yangtze and Han Rivers in early July, the water levels of the Jialing River and Han River have been rising. On the 8th, a flood peak appeared at the Cuntan Station on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, with a flow rate of over 40,000 cubic meters per second. Today, this flood peak has passed Wanxian. On the 6th, the Han River experienced a flood peak of over 16,000 cubic meters per second. The water level at Xiangyang Station once exceeded the warning line. After the Dujiatai Flood Diversion Gate was opened for flood diversion, the water level has stabilized and fallen.

　　Affected by rainfall in the Yi-Luo River basin, the Qinchang Station in Henan Province on the Yellow River experienced its first major flood peak on the 7th, with a flow rate of 9,000 cubic meters per second. The flood peak has now passed the Gaocun Station, and the water levels at Gaocun and the downstream Sunkou Station are above the warning line. Under the command of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the river affairs bureaus of Henan and Shandong provinces, the people along the river in the two provinces are strengthening flood prevention and preparing for a hard two or three days to overcome the flood.

　　The Sha Ying River's Luohe Station, a tributary of the Huai River, also experienced a flood peak on the 7th, with a flow rate of over 2,000 cubic meters per second, exceeding the warning water level by more than two meters. Currently, the flow rate has decreased, and the water level has begun to recede.

    长江汉江黄河和淮河支流
    相继出现洪峰
    新华社9日讯  长江、汉江、黄河和淮河支流最近相继出现了洪峰。
    7月初，由于长江、汉江上游连日降雨，嘉陵江、汉江水位都在上涨。8日长江上游寸滩站出现洪峰，流量达四万多秒公方。今天这个洪峰已过万县。汉江在6日出现了一万六千多秒公方的洪峰，襄阳站水位曾一度超出警戒线，经杜家台分洪闸启闸分洪后，水位已稳落。
    由于伊洛河流域降雨影响，黄河河南省秦厂站在7日出现了首次较大洪峰，流量达九千秒公方。目前洪峰已过高村站，高村及其以下的孙口站水位都在警戒线以上。河南、山东两省沿河人民在黄河水利委员会和两省河务局的指挥下，正加强防汛，准备苦战二、三天战胜洪水。
    淮河支流沙颍河漯河站7日也出现了洪峰，流量二千多秒公方，超出警戒水位二公尺多，目前流量已减小，水位已开始退落。
