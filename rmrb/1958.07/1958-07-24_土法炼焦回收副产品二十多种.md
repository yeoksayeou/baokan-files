Xinhua News Agency Report: Indigenous coking can also recover more than twenty kinds of by-products, such as gasoline, diesel, kerosene, benzene, and almond perfume. This was successfully tested recently by the Shengjian Coking Plant in Zou County, Shandong Province.

The equipment of this coking plant is simple, and the technical and cultural level of the workers is relatively low. In the past, they used indigenous methods of coking, and many useful components contained in the coal were lost with the thick smoke. This year, they emancipated their minds and proposed that if large coking plants can produce many by-products at the same time, shouldn't our small indigenous coking plant be able to capture those things that are lost? They used their brains in all aspects, thought of ways, researched indigenous equipment for recovering by-products, and sent people to chemical fertilizer plants and coking plants in Nanjing and other places to learn. Under the leadership and support of the Party, after five months of practical and hard work by all the workers in the plant, they finally recovered twenty-seven kinds of by-products from the coking process. Among them, four products including gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and preservative oil have begun to be produced in relatively large quantities.

    土法炼焦回收副产品二十多种
    据新华社讯　土法炼焦也能从中回收汽油、柴油、煤油、苯和杏仁香水等多种副产品。这是山东省邹县生建炼焦厂在最近试验成功的。
    这个炼焦厂设备简陋，职工的技术水平、文化水平都较低。过去他们用土法炼焦，煤中所含的许多有用成分都随着浓烟跑掉了。今年他们解放思想，提出大炼焦厂能同时生产很多副产品，我们这个土法炼焦的小厂子难道就不能把那些跑掉的东西捉回来吗？他们从各方面动脑筋，想办法，研究回收副产品的土设备，并且派人到南京等地的化学肥料厂和炼焦厂学习。在党的领导和支持下，全厂工人经过五个月的实干、苦干，终于从炼焦过程中回收出了二十七种副产品。其中汽油、煤油、柴油和防腐油等四种产品已开始较大量地生产。
