Glimpses of the Future (Prose Poem)
Syria Jilielan·Halil·Jilielan

Through the layers of the present, I hear the hymns of humanity; I hear the bells ringing in unison, vibrating the particles of the ether. This chime announces the beginning of the prayer in the temple of beauty; the power of creation has cast these bells from the ore of emotion and hangs them above the temple - above the hearts of men.

Through the future, I see crowds kneeling on the bosom of nature, bowing and worshiping toward the east, they await, waiting for the dawn - the morning light of truth.

I see cities disappearing, leaving only a chain of hills, announcing that darkness has faded before the light.

I see some old men, sitting in the shade of weeping willows, surrounded by children, listening to the old men tell stories of the past.

I see young men plucking ancient zithers and playing transverse flutes, and girls with their hair down dancing around them under jasmine flowers.

I see men harvesting crops, and women carrying bundles of grain on their backs, singing hymns of abundance and joy.

I see a woman, replacing her unsightly clothes with a garland woven from lilies and a sash made of fresh leaves.

I see friendship, which is forged by mankind with all things; flocks of birds and insects fly to people without fear, and herds of antelopes run freely to the water's edge. I looked, but I did not see poverty, nor did I see anything more than satisfaction. I found love and equality, and I did not see professional doctors, because knowledge and experience made everyone their own doctor. I did not see people whose profession was priests, because the conscience of mankind has become the supreme priest. I did not see lawyers, because nature has replaced the court, and here it has established a covenant of friendly alliance between people.

I see man, he understands that he is the foundation of all things on earth. He rises above the trivial and transcends the vulgar. He opens the curtain of doubt with the eyes of his soul; she - his soul, begins to read the words written by the colorful clouds on the face of space, and appreciates the pictures painted by the breeze on the water. She - his soul, understands the fragrance of flowers, and understands the songs of mountain birds and nightingales.

Through the layers of the present, I see on the stage of the distant future, a betrothed couple, that is, the beauty goddess and the human soul are about to be united, and all of present life is the night of human destiny.

    瞻望未来（散文诗）
    叙利亚　纪伯伦·哈里尔·纪伯伦
    透过现时的层壁，我听到了人类的赞歌；我听到钟声齐鸣，振荡着以太的微粒，这阵钟声宣告那美神的殿堂的祈祷正在开始；造化的力量用感情的矿石铸成了这些钟，又将它们悬在殿堂的上空——悬在人们的心灵上。
    透过未来，我看见人群跪在大自然的胸脯上，向着东方稽首膜拜，他们期待着，期待着曙色的来临——那是真理的晨光。
    我看见城市消逝了；只遗留下一片丘陵，它宣告黑暗在光明的面前敛迹。
    我看见有几位老人，坐在依依的杨柳荫下，四周团坐着孩子们，倾听老人们讲述往昔。
    我看见少男们拨古琴，弄横笛，姑娘们披散着头发，围绕着他们在素馨花下舞蹈。
    我看见男人们收割庄稼，妇女们背着禾捆，吟唱富庶和欢乐的赞歌。
    我看见一个女子，换上了用百合编成的花环和新鲜的树叶结成的腰带，以代替她那不中看的衣衫。
    我看见了友谊，那是人类与万物所缔结成的；鸟群与昆虫毫无忌惮地飞临人前，一群群羚羊自由自在地奔向水边。我看了，但是不曾看见贫困，也不曾看见比满足更多的事情。我寻见的是友爱与平等，我并没有看到专业医生，因为知识与经验使得每人都成为自己的医生。我没有看到以神甫为职业的人，因为人类的良知已经成为至高无上的神甫。我没有看到律师，因为大自然代替了法庭，在这儿订立了人们之间友好同盟的契约。
    我看见人，他明白自己才是大地万物的基础。他驾凌乎繁琐之上，超越了卑俗。他以心灵的眼睛开启了疑虑的帷幔；她——他的心灵，开始读彩云写在太空面庞上的文字，欣赏微风绘在水面上的图画。她——他的心灵，懂得花朵的气息，理解山鸟与夜莺的歌。
    透过现时的层壁，我看到迢遥的未来的舞台上，一对未婚夫妻，那是美神与人类的心灵正要结合，而现时的全部生活，乃是人类命运的夜晚。
