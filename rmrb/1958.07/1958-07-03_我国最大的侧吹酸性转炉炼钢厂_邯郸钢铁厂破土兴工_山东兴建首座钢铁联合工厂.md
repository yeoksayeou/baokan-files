Xinhua News Agency, Handan, July 2nd. China's largest side-blown acid converter steel plant, the Handan Iron and Steel Plant, broke ground on July 1st. The first phase of this steel plant will be put into operation in 1960, with an annual output of 900,000 tons of iron, 600,000 tons of steel, and 500,000 tons of steel products. After the completion of the second phase in 1962, its steel output will increase to 1.2 million tons.

Originally, the Handan Iron and Steel Plant was planned to produce 430,000 tons of iron, 300,000 tons of steel, and 250,000 tons of steel products annually, to be completed in four years. In early June, the workers responsible for the construction of this steel plant, inspired by the General Line, boldly changed the original design, minimizing unnecessary auxiliary projects without increasing investment by even one yuan, thereby doubling the designed production capacity of the first phase and shortening the completion date by one and a half years.

After this plant is put into operation, it will use the steel produced by the plant to roll medium and small steel, medium and thick steel plates, and thin steel plates, providing a material basis for the agricultural mechanization and rural electrification, and other agricultural technological transformations in Hebei Province. At the same time, the plant also has a large coking workshop that can produce 19 kinds of chemical raw materials such as crude benzene and ammonium sulfate.

The advantage of using side-blown acid converters for steelmaking is that the equipment is simple, and there is no need to build large factories and auxiliary equipment, resulting in less investment and faster construction. The total investment for the first phase of this steel plant is 120 million yuan, which is 10 million yuan less than the investment in building a steel plant of the same scale using open-hearth steelmaking.

The Handan area has abundant iron ore resources, and there is the Fengfeng Coal Mine nearby, which produces high-grade coking coal, making it one of China's ideal iron and steel bases.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 2nd. Shandong Province's first integrated iron and steel plant, the Jinan Iron and Steel Plant, officially began construction on July 1st.

The originally planned annual production capacity of this steel plant was: 300,000 tons of steel ingots, 350,000 tons of pig iron, 250,000 tons of steel products, and 500,000 tons of metallurgical coke, to be fully completed in the second half of 1961. However, after repeated revisions by the construction workers based on the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical," it has now been decided to complete the plant by 1960 with the original investment, increasing the annual production capacity to 600,000 tons of steel ingots, 900,000 tons of pig iron, 500,000 tons of steel products, and 1.2 million tons of metallurgical coke.

The iron ore needed for this plant will be taken from the iron ore mines along the railway in the suburbs of Jinan.

    我国最大的侧吹酸性转炉炼钢厂
    邯郸钢铁厂破土兴工
    山东兴建首座钢铁联合工厂
    新华社邯郸2日电　我国规模最大的侧吹酸性转炉炼钢厂——邯郸钢铁厂1日破土动工。这个钢铁厂的第一期工程将在1960年投入生产，年产九十万吨铁，六十万吨钢和五十万吨钢材；到1962年第二期工程完成以后，它的钢产量将增加到一百二十万吨。
    邯郸钢铁厂原计划年产四十三万吨铁、三十万吨钢和二十五万吨钢材，四年建成。6月初，负责筹建这座钢铁厂的职工在总路线的鼓舞下，大胆地改变原来的设计，尽量减少不必要的附属项目，不增加一元钱的投资，使第一期工程的设计生产能力增加一倍，建成日期缩短一年半。
    这个厂投入生产以后，将利用本厂产的钢轧制中小型钢材、中厚钢板和薄钢板，为河北省农业机械化和农村电气化等农业技术改造，提供物质基础。同时，这个厂还设有大型焦化车间，能生产粗苯、硫铵等十九种化工原料。
    采用侧吹酸性转炉炼钢的好处，是设备简单，不用建设大型厂房和附属设备，因而投资少、建设快。这个钢铁厂的第一期工程全部投资一亿二千万元，比建同样规模的平炉炼钢的钢铁厂投资少一千万元。
    邯郸地区铁矿资源蕴藏很丰富，附近有产高级炼焦煤的峰峰煤矿，是我国理想的钢铁基地之一。
    据新华社济南2日电　山东省第一座钢铁联合工厂——济南钢铁厂1日正式动工兴建。
    这座钢铁厂原来计划的年产能力是：钢锭三十万吨，生铁三十五万吨，钢材二十五万吨，冶金焦五十万吨，1961年下半年全部建成。但是由于建厂职工们根据多快好省的原则经过反复修改，现在决定把这个厂按原投资提前到1960年建成，年产能力增加到钢锭六十万吨，生铁九十万吨，钢材五十万吨，冶金焦一百二十万吨。
    这个厂所需要的铁矿石将取自济南郊区铁路沿线的铁矿。
