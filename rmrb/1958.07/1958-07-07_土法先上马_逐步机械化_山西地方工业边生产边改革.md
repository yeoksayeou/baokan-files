Shanxi Province's local industries are taking the path of "first mounting the horse with indigenous methods, and then gradually realizing mechanization," adopting the method of continuous revolution to carry out mass-based technological reforms.

Shanxi's local industries originally had a relatively good foundation, and the recent adoption of indigenous methods to build factories has greatly accelerated the speed of development. In May, more than 15,000 new factories and mines were built throughout the province. However, due to the limitations of equipment conditions and technical levels, the development of productivity in these new factories and mines has been affected to a certain extent. Therefore, according to the needs of developing production, various places are relying on the masses of workers to take the approach of building factories, producing, and reforming simultaneously, actively improving production equipment and operating technologies. When Wutai County started smelting iron and copper, the equipment and technical conditions were poor. They used white clay to build blast furnaces and earthen bellows to blow air. Four workers pulling the bellows were sweating profusely, and each furnace only smelted dozens of pounds. Later, they switched to using a portable steam engine and a fan with bearing balls to blow air. The combination of indigenous methods and machines increased the output dozens of times, and the quality also improved. JingLe, Baode, and other counties learned these methods, which also rapidly improved iron and copper smelting technology, and the output increased greatly. Many newly built factories and mines are implementing the principle of identifying problems where they exist, using them as topics for articles, and inspiring workers' creativity to improve technology and promote production.

Some old factories and mines that have been built for a long time are also carrying out universal reforms based on the problems existing in production. The Wuzhai Distillery originally had crude equipment and poor technical conditions, and could only use grain to produce white liquor. Later, the workers traveled to thirty agricultural cooperatives in ten townships to investigate brewing resources, and collectively researched and trial-produced new products. They used only potatoes to make more than thirty products, including liquor, vinegar, soy sauce, maltose, and pastries. In addition, they extracted raw materials for electrical engineering, casting, rubber, and medicine, turning the Wuzhai Distillery into the Wuzhai Food United Factory.

In order to ensure the full utilization of new equipment and new operating technologies, various places have also improved the technical level of workers through technological reforms. When Changzhi Prefecture focused on trial-producing "small blast furnaces," it organized workers from various counties to visit the site and actually operate the furnaces, enabling a large number of workers to learn the complete set of technologies from factory construction to production, and then return to their respective counties to teach and promote them. Xin County Prefecture adopted the method of sending people out to study and inviting people into the factory to guide them, and also quickly trained a group of technical backbones, so that the dozens of small iron and copper smelting blast furnaces in the entire district had an average of two or three technicians each. In addition, along with technological reforms, various places have adopted methods such as running short-term training classes, making local adjustments, and promoting outstanding workers to become cadres, replenishing management cadres and coordinating with technological reforms from the perspective of business management.

### 土法先上马　逐步机械化  山西地方工业边生产边改革

    土法先上马　逐步机械化
    山西地方工业边生产边改革
    本报讯　山西省地方工业，正在沿着“先用土法跨上马，逐步实现机械化”的道路，采取不断革命的办法，进行群众性的技术改革。
    山西的地方工业原来基础较好，最近采用土法建厂，大大加快发展速度。5月份，全省新建厂矿一万五千多个。但是，这些新厂矿由于设备条件和技术水平的限制，生产力的发展受到一定的影响。因此，各地按着发展生产的需要，依靠工人群众采取边建厂、边生产、边改革的办法，积极改善生产设备和操作技术。五台县开始炼铁、炼铜时，设备和技术条件较差，他们用白?土垒砌高炉，用土风箱吹风，四个工人拉风箱累得满头大汗，每炉只炼几十斤。后来，改用锅驼机和带轴承滚珠的扇车吹风，土办法加上机器，产量一下提高数十倍，质量也有提高。静乐、保德等县学习了这些办法，也使炼铁、炼铜技术迅速提高，产量随着大大增加。许多新建成的厂矿实行那里有问题就在那里出题目作文章，启发工人的创造性，来提高技术推动生产。
    有些建厂时间较久的老厂矿，也根据生产上存在的问题普遍进行改革。五寨酒厂原来设备简陋，技术条件差，只能用粮食生产白酒。后来，工人们跑遍十个乡三十多农业社调查酿酒资源，集体研究试制新产品，仅用山药蛋就作出酒、醋、酱、饴糖、糕点等三十多种产品，另外还提炼出电工、铸造、橡胶、医药原料，把五寨酒厂变成了五寨食品联合厂。
    为了保证新的设备和新的操作技术的充分运用，各地还通过技术改革，锻炼提高工人的技术水平。长治地区重点试办“小高炉”时，组织各县工人到现场参观和实际操作，使大批工人学会从建厂到生产的全套技术，然后回各县传授推广。忻县地区采取派人出去留学和请人进厂指导的办法，也很快培养一批技术骨干，使全区数十座炼铁、炼铜小高炉，平均每座有了两三个技术工人。另外，各地还随着技术改革，采取开办短期训练班、地方调整、提拔优秀工人当干部等办法，充实了管理干部，从经营管理工作上配合技术改革。
