Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: The Oroqen and Evenk hunters in the Greater Khingan Range forest region, who suffered fourteen years of brutal persecution under Japanese imperialism, are expressing immense anger at the armed aggression of U.S. and British imperialism in the Middle East.

On July 23rd, Oroqen hunters and residents of the Evenk, Daur, Mongolian, and two other ethnic groups from the Oroqen Autonomous Banner held a mass rally in Xiaoergou, the seat of the Autonomous Banner People's Committee, to protest the U.S. and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East. The Oroqen hunters mentioned in their speeches that under the persecution of Japanese imperialism, the Oroqen people were long trapped in economic stagnation, cultural backwardness, impoverished lives, and rampant diseases, with the entire ethnic group nearly facing extinction. Only after liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, did the Oroqen people gradually heal their old wounds. The renowned veteran hunter, Tong Gumei, the Civil Affairs Section Chief of the Autonomous Banner People's Committee, said passionately at the meeting that the U.S. and British imperialists' invasion of Lebanon and Jordan is just like the Japanese imperialists' past invasion of our Chinese people. We resolutely oppose it. Hunter representative Keda Manchun shouted at the meeting, "U.S. and British robbers, get out of the Middle East!"

The Evenk hunting community in the Ergun Banner also held a gathering of nearly a thousand people on July 20th. The hunters at the meeting sternly denounced the banditry of the U.S. and British imperialists and expressed their determination to fully support the Arab people's just struggle for national independence and freedom.

    大兴安岭燃起反侵略烈火
    鄂伦春人要全力支持阿拉伯人民
    据新华社呼和浩特电　大兴安岭森林地区曾经遭受日本帝国主义十四年残酷迫害的鄂伦春族和鄂温克族猎人们，对美英帝国主义在中东的武装侵略表示极大的愤怒。
    23日，鄂伦春自治旗的鄂伦春族猎民和当地的鄂温克、达斡尔、蒙古等五个民族的居民，在自治旗人民委员会所在地小二沟举行了抗议美英帝国主义侵略中东的群众大会。鄂伦春族猎人们在会上的发言中都提到，鄂伦春族在日本帝国主义的迫害下，长期陷于经济停滞、文化落后、生活贫困、疫病流行的境地，整个民族几乎濒于灭亡。解放后，鄂伦春族在中国共产党的领导下，才逐渐治好了旧日的创伤。著名的老猎手、自治旗人民委员会民政科长佟古梅在会上激昂地说，美英帝国主义者侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，就像日本帝国主义者过去侵略我们中国人民一样。我们坚决反对。猎民代表克达满春在会上高呼“美英强盗滚出中东去！”
    鄂温克族猎民聚居区——额尔古纳旗，20日也举行了近千人的集会。猎民们在会上严厉斥责美英帝国主义者的强盗行为，并且表示要全力支援阿拉伯人民争取民族独立自由的正义斗争。
