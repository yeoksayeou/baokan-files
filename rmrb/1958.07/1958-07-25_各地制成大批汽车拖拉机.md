Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 24th: In just a few months this year, our country has successfully trial-produced fifty types of automobiles and one hundred seventy-three types of tractors. This year, our country will be able to manufacture 20,000 automobiles and 40,000 tractors.

Now, high-performance, comfortable and beautiful sedans, special-purpose off-road vehicles, as well as trucks, large buses, micro-cars, and multi-purpose vehicles, have all been manufactured. The tractor industry has also successively manufactured tire-type, crawler-type, hand-held, and paddy field tractors.

    据新华社天津24日电　在今年的短短几个月当中，我国各地已经试制成功五十种汽车，一百七十三种拖拉机。今年，我国就能制造出两万辆汽车、四万台拖拉机。
    今年以前，我国还只能自制一种汽车。而现在，性能优良、舒适美观的小轿车，特种用途的越野车，以及载重车、大客车、微型车和万能汽车等，都已经制造出来了。拖拉机工业也相继制造出了轮胎式、履带式、手扶式和水田用的拖拉机。
