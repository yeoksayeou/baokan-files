    The Guangzhou Uprising was another urban armed uprising that shook the world after the Nanchang Uprising. Although the uprising itself failed due to the specific circumstances of the enemy being strong and we being weak at the time, it, together with the Nanchang Uprising and the Autumn Harvest Uprising, marked the great beginning of the Chinese revolution under the sole leadership of the Communist Party, and also the victorious starting point for the Chinese proletariat to move from the cities to the countryside and establish and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.
    In the 1920s, profound changes took place in Chinese society. The decisive influence on this change was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921. From its birth, the Party has continuously promoted Marxism-Leninism to the people of the whole country and put forward an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal political program. These propositions, which appeared after the October Revolution in Russia and during the vigorous development of the democratic movement, immediately received enthusiastic responses from millions of people, and also greatly influenced Sun Yat-sen, who had been engaged in revolution for thirty or forty years without success. Sun Yat-sen and some progressive Kuomintang members accepted the Communist Party's political program, reorganized the Kuomintang, implemented the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants, and, with the help of the Communist Party, founded the Whampoa Military Academy and established a revolutionary armed force with the participation of the Communist Party. On this basis, Sun Yat-sen and the reorganized Kuomintang, relying on the support of the broad masses of revolutionary people, suppressed Chen Jiongming's rebellion, eliminated all kinds of warlords, and stabilized the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi, providing a solid base and rear for the subsequent Northern Expedition.
    In July 1926, the vigorous Northern Expedition began. Under the influence and promotion of the Communist Party, the Northern Expeditionary Army was full of vigor and invincible, driving straight into the Yangtze River basin with irresistible force. However, just as the revolution was developing vigorously and the people of the whole country were rejoicing, the imperialist lackey Chiang Kai-shek turned his guns against the revolution. Soon, the Kuomintang in Wuhan openly betrayed the revolution and joined forces with Chiang Kai-shek. After the Kuomintang betrayed the revolution, it established a White Terror counter-revolutionary rule centered on Chiang Kai-shek. Countless Communist Party members and revolutionary masses were brutally murdered, and the Great Revolution, which had achieved great victories, suffered a serious setback. The situation in the Yangtze River basin plummeted. Many people with weak wills were frightened by the Kuomintang's White Terror and surrendered to the counter-revolution, siding with Nanjing. The broad masses of workers and peasants, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary young intellectuals were filled with righteous indignation as a result of this serious blow, but could not find a way forward. The development of the situation presented the Chinese Communists with an urgent task: the Communist Party must step forward, hold high its red flag, shake off all wavering elements, unite all revolutionary forces, independently lead the broad masses of workers and peasants, smash the counter-revolution's rampant offensive, and continue to struggle. The Nanchang Uprising was a heroic action taken to save the revolution.
    The Nanchang Uprising greatly encouraged the Communist Party members and some progressive armed forces who withdrew from Wuhan, enabling them to see a glimmer of light in the darkness, see the future and direction of the revolution, and follow in the footsteps of the Nanchang Uprising troops, withdrawing south to the Pearl River basin, preparing to use Guangzhou as a base to regroup and wait for an opportunity to rise again.
    The Fourth Army Training Regiment, reorganized from the original Wuhan Military Academy, which followed Zhang Fakui south, aroused Zhang Fakui's suspicion and was disarmed when it reached Jiujiang. The students' thinking was very confused, fearing that Zhang Fakui would also imitate Chiang Kai-shek and carry out a "Party purge," and most of them were preparing to flee. After some motivational work and pointing out the bright future of the revolution, the students' emotions stabilized. Then, more than 2,000 people were reassembled and continued south. When they arrived at Wan'an, some people suggested launching an uprising in Wan'an, confiscating the Twenty-sixth Army's weapons, and joining forces with the Nanchang Uprising Army. At that time, the regiment's Party committee believed that it was necessary to consolidate this armed force first and then launch an uprising after entering the enemy's heart—Guangzhou. On the one hand, the Nanchang Uprising Army had already moved south and there was no contact, and any action would be isolated and helpless; on the other hand, it was also considered that Guangzhou was the base of the Northern Expeditionary Army, the people had a tradition of revolution, and launching an uprising there would not only have a relatively solid mass base, but also the blow to the enemy would be far greater than in Wan'an. For this reason, the regiment's Party committee decided that the training regiment should continue to follow Zhang Fakui to Guangzhou.
    In October, the Fourth Army drove away the Gui系warlords and stationed in Guangzhou.
    Since the Kuomintang betrayed the revolution, although Guangzhou was also ruled by counter-revolutionary forces, the Guangzhou workers, peasants, and some patriotic young intellectuals who had been tempered by the Great Revolution and awakened, were not frightened by the White Terror. On the contrary, they were more closely united and, under the leadership of the Communist Party, continued to wage a heroic struggle. After we returned to Guangzhou, it further encouraged their fighting spirit, and the revolutionary atmosphere became even higher. The trade union organizations that had been destroyed by the Kuomintang were restored, the momentum of demonstrations became larger and larger, and the peasant movement in the suburbs also had new developments.
    The revolutionary masses of Guangzhou had great illusions about Zhang Fakui, hoping that the last armed force left by the Northern Expeditionary Army could lead them to continue the revolution. When going south, Zhang Fakui also expressed his willingness to return to Guangdong to continue the revolution, but when he saw the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the Guangzhou people, he wavered again, and finally took off his fake leftist coat, revealing his original reactionary face, and colluded with Wang Jingwei to suppress the worker-peasant movement and arrest and kill Communist Party members in Guangzhou. This city, which was once the lighthouse of the national revolution, was now shrouded in counter-revolutionary clouds, darkness replaced light, and the revolutionary forces suffered serious destruction. The facts before them clearly told the Communists: only by taking up arms and leading the worker-peasant masses to rise up in revolt, otherwise the revolutionary forces would inevitably be brutally destroyed. On November 28, the Guangdong Provincial Committee made a decision to launch an armed uprising of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Guangzhou, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee.
    More than a year ago, a hot and enthusiastic Northern Expedition, like a prairie fire, burned from Guangzhou to Nanchang, to Wuhan, and throughout the entire Yangtze River basin. But how long ago, due to imperialist intervention and Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution, this prairie fire was almost extinguished, leaving only sparks! At this critical historical juncture, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese revolutionary people continued to hold high the banner of revolution, and burned these sparks from Wuhan to Nanchang, to the southern provinces, and to the birthplace of the Northern Expedition—Guangzhou.
    At that time, Guangzhou under the rule of Zhang Fakui was in an unstable state: Chen Mingshu's troops were advancing from Shantou to Guangzhou, and Huang Shaohong's troops were gathering in Wuzhou, also appearing to be attacking Guangzhou. Zhang Fakui had to concentrate all his strength to consolidate his base, deciding to deal with the Gui系 first, and then Chen Mingshu, so he appointed Huang Qixiang as the commander of the front line, transferred all the troops away from Guangzhou, and went to Zhaoqing and Wuzhou to fight Huang Shaohong. At the same time, he re-armed the disarmed training regiment to defend Guangzhou. Guangzhou actually only had the training regiment, a newly formed guard regiment, and some police armed forces, and the enemy's interior was very empty.
    This was a great opportunity to launch an armed uprising. Seeing this situation, the Guangdong Provincial Committee immediately established an "Action Committee" to step up preparations for the uprising, unify the various workers' organizations into the Workers' Red Guards, and secretly distribute weapons to arm them; through Party relations, a large number of Party military cadres and Hong Kong-Guangdong strike workers were secretly sent into the guard regiment, so that the guard regiment was basically controlled by our Party. On December 7, the "Action Committee" secretly held a workers', peasants', and soldiers' representative conference, elected an executive committee, and decided to launch the uprising on the 13th.
    The Guangzhou working class's high revolutionary enthusiasm aroused the attention and vigilance of the imperialists and the Kuomintang, and coupled with the fact that they had received news that we were going to launch an uprising in Guangzhou, they stepped up their sabotage from within. Under the instructions of the imperialists and the Nanjing Kuomintang, Zhang Fakui hurriedly recalled Huang Qixiang, the commander of the front line, and prepared to disband the training regiment; at the same time, he announced a special curfew on the 10th, checking household registrations day and night. The reactionary troops far from Guangzhou also began to move towards Guangzhou. Under these circumstances, the "Action Committee" had to advance the time of the uprising to the 11th.
    At about 2:00 a.m. on the 11th, the training regiment students, who were called "red sons and grandsons" by the reactionaries, immediately engaged in battles in the city after shooting the special agent chief of staff sent by Zhang Fakui and some reactionary military officers. At the same time, the Workers' Red Guards lurking in various parts of the city, like ten thousand arrows fired simultaneously, attacked various designated targets; the guard regiment, led by regiment leader Liang Bingshu, also announced the uprising after disarming some reactionary military officers and soldiers. In just over an hour, the first battalion of the training regiment and the first detachment of the Workers' Red Guards crushed the enemy's stubborn resistance under the cover of armored vehicles, captured the most solid reactionary fortress, the Public Security Bureau, and established the Soviet government there. Other uprising teams also successively occupied the radio station, post office, district police stations, and other Kuomintang party and government organs. Red flags were almost planted all over the city, red cloth banners were hung all over the streets and alleys, and the walls were covered with slogans of the worker-peasant revolution. Guangzhou, which was shrouded in counter-revolutionary clouds just a few hours ago, had now become a boiling, victory-filled Guangzhou.
    It must be pointed out that the imperialist armed intervention put the uprising army in an unfavorable position. The British, American, Japanese, and other imperialists, in addition to sending warships to continuously bombard our urban area, also sent marine corps to land along the Bund. French imperialism also participated in this intervention. Under the cover of imperialist warships, the counter-revolutionary troops in the city launched a fierce counterattack against us. The enemies in the suburbs of Guangzhou were also preparing to come to reinforce. Shortly after the start of the uprising, the general command of the uprising discussed the current situation. At that time, it was proposed that: the gunfire should be stopped quickly, the revolutionary order in the city should be established, and all remaining strongholds that had not yet been captured should be surrounded and monitored, and they should be disintegrated politically and won over; the army should be rapidly expanded on the basis of the training regiment, and the Workers' Red Guards and the training regiment should be merged to form three divisions; the battle line should be pushed to the suburbs, the peasants should be mobilized, and peasant troops should be organized in order to meet the enemy coming to reinforce. Everyone believed that these measures were correct, but unfortunately, time did not allow us to do so. The enemy was advancing rapidly with the help of imperialist warships. We did not have time to establish revolutionary order in the city, to expand the armed forces centered on the training regiment, or to push the battle line to the suburbs, and the enemy had already surrounded us from three sides. Xue Yue's troops, who came from Jiangmen, Xu Zhirui's troops, who came from Shaoguan, and Li Hanhun's troops, who came from Shilong, quickly seized the main strongholds in the city again. Under the situation where the enemy was strong and we were weak, the uprising troops, after three days and nights of heroic fighting, had to withdraw from Guangzhou.
    The failure of the Great Revolution was certainly due to the betrayal of the Kuomintang and the intervention of imperialism, but from the perspective of the working class party, inexperience and mistakes made by the leading organs were also the reasons for the failure of the revolution. At the beginning of the Great Revolution, the Chinese Communist Party, which was still in its infancy, although it already understood the importance of armed struggle at that time, its understanding was still insufficient, and it lacked positive and correct guidelines. Especially in the later period of the Great Revolution, due to Chen Duxiu's opportunist leadership, he did not dare to boldly mobilize the masses, arm the masses, and did not actively grasp the army, but placed the hope of the revolution on the bourgeoisie, fantasizing about achieving the victory of the proletarian revolution through peaceful means. In this way, the Party did not have sufficient strength to prevent the Kuomintang's betrayal and crush their attack on the revolution after the betrayal. The failure of the Great Revolution profoundly educated the Chinese Communists, and made them thoroughly realize from the painful lessons that: the Chinese revolution can only be led by the Communist Party, and the bourgeoisie and all other classes cannot lead the Chinese revolution to complete victory; the main form of the Chinese revolution cannot be peaceful, but only armed revolution against armed counter-revolution; the Chinese revolution must have its own revolutionary army, and without a revolutionary army, there would be nothing for the revolution. The Nanchang Uprising, the Autumn Harvest Uprising, the Guangzhou Uprising, and other armed uprisings in various places were launched on this basis. This was a firm and arduous great transformation. From this starting point, the land revolutionary war began—the worker-peasant revolution led solely by the Communist Party, and the creation of the Chinese people's own army—the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army—began.
    Therefore, the Guangzhou Uprising was by no means a passive "battle of retreat," but at this turning point, the Party, in order to save the revolution and to smash the rampant offensive of the counter-revolution, rose up to lead the revolutionary people in an active and heroic counterattack against the counter-revolutionary forces. As Chairman Mao said in his book "On Coalition Government": The heroic Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese revolutionary people
  "were not frightened, conquered, or killed off. They got up from the underground, wiped the blood from their bodies, buried the bodies of their comrades, and they continued to fight."
    Although the Guangzhou Uprising failed, it did not completely fail. Some of the uprising armed forces that withdrew from Guangzhou later joined forces with the peasant uprising armed forces in the Dongjiang and Zuoyoujiang areas, spreading the seeds of revolution to the vast countryside and continuing the revolutionary struggle.
    The lessons left by the Guangzhou Uprising are multifaceted, and one of the main ones is that the proletarian vanguard must send its own cadres to the countryside. At that time, the revolution had already entered a low ebb. Under the conditions where the enemy was strong and we were weak, the most urgent task of the revolution was not to immediately seize the cities, but how to preserve strength, transfer it to the countryside where the counter-revolutionary forces were weak, organize and mobilize the broad masses of peasants to carry out guerrilla warfare, establish and develop rural base areas, and rely on the countryside to encircle the cities, and finally seize the cities and achieve revolutionary victory. Victory is impossible without the revolution leaving the solid worker-peasant alliance and without the active participation of the peasants. However, these lessons were not recognized by some of the Party's leading comrades until a considerable period of time after the failure of the Guangzhou Uprising. Our minds at that time were still filled with the bourgeois old democratic revolution's idea of ​​taking the city as a base, and we did not have a correct understanding of the strength of the peasants. Only Chairman Mao, in the actual struggle of leading the Chinese revolution, creatively solved this fundamental issue related to the success or failure of the Chinese revolution based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and combined with the characteristics of the Chinese nation, and guided the revolution to achieve victory in China based on this principle. If the Guangzhou Uprising had not been nostalgic for the city, and had consciously and actively developed towards the countryside rapidly after the uprising, and cooperated with the Haifeng-Lufeng peasant movement that was developing vigorously at that time, established rural base areas, and carried out guerrilla warfare with the land revolution as the central content, then the uprising would have achieved greater victory.

    大革命失败与广州起义
    中华人民共和国元帅　叶剑英
    广州起义是继南昌起义后，又一次震动世界的城市武装起义。虽然，在当时敌强我弱的具体情况下，起义本身遭到了失败，但它和南昌起义、秋收起义连接起来，是中国革命由共产党单独领导的伟大开端，也是中国无产阶级从城市转入乡村，建立与巩固工农联盟的胜利起点。
    二十世纪二十年代，中国社会发生了极其深刻的变化，对这个变化有着决定影响的，就是1921年中国共产党的诞生。党从诞生时起，就不断地向全国人民宣传马克思列宁主义，提出反帝反封建的政治纲领。这些主张，在俄国十月革命之后和民主运动蓬勃发展的时期出现，马上得到千百万人民的热烈响应，也给从事革命三四十年而没有取得胜利的孙中山以很大的影响。孙中山和一部分进步的国民党员接受了共产党的政纲，改组了国民党，实行了联俄、联共、扶助工农的三大政策，并在共产党帮助下创办了黄埔军校，建立了有共产党参加的革命武装。在这个基础上，孙中山以及改组过了的国民党依靠广大革命群众的支援，镇压了陈炯明的叛变，消灭了形形色色的军阀，安定了两广局势，使后来的北伐革命有了巩固的基地与后方。
    1926年7月，轰轰烈烈的北伐革命开始了。在共产党的影响与推动下，北伐军士气昂扬，所向无敌，以破竹之势，直驱长江流域。但是，正当革命蓬勃向前发展，全国人民欢欣鼓舞时，帝国主义走狗蒋介石却把枪口转向革命。不久，武汉的国民党也公开叛变革命，并与蒋介石合流。国民党叛变革命以后，就以蒋介石为中心建立了白色恐怖的反革命统治。无数共产党员和革命群众遭到残酷的杀害，已经取得了巨大胜利的大革命遭到严重的挫折。长江流域形势一落千丈。许多意志薄弱的人，被国民党的白色恐怖吓倒，向反革命投降，倒向南京方面去了。广大的工农群众和革命士兵，以及革命知识青年，遭此严重打击，因而义愤填胸，但找不到前进的方向。形势的发展给中国共产党人提出了一个紧迫的任务：共产党必须挺身而出，高举自己的红旗，甩开一切动摇分子，把一切革命的力量团结起来，单独地领导广大工农群众，粉碎反革命的猖狂进攻，继续奋斗下去。南昌起义就是为了挽救革命所采取的英勇行动。
    南昌起义大大鼓舞了从武汉退出的共产党员和一部分进步武装，使他们从黑暗中看到了一线光明，看到了革命的前途和方向，并跟着南昌起义部队的足迹，纷纷南下，向珠江流域撤退，准备以广州作为根据地，重整旗鼓，待机再起。
    随张发奎南下的由原武汉军校改编的第四军教导团，南行至九江，曾引起张发奎的猜疑被缴了械。学员们的思想十分混乱，唯恐张发奎也效仿蒋介石来个“清党”，大部分人准备逃亡。经过一番鼓动工作，并指出革命的光明前途，学员们的情绪才安定下来。于是，重新集合起两千多人，继续南下。到达万安，有些人提出就在万安举行暴动，把二十六军的枪械收缴后与南昌起义军会合。当时团党委认为应该先巩固这支武装，待进到敌人的心脏——广州之后，再举行起义。这一方面是南昌起义军已经南下，没有联系，行动起来孤立无援；另一方面也考虑到广州是北伐军的根据地，人民素有革命传统，在那里举行起义，不但有比较坚实的群众基础，而且给敌人的打击也会远远超过万安。为此，团党委决定教导团继续随张发奎向广州进发。
    10月间，第四军赶跑了桂系军伐，进驻广州。
    自国民党叛变革命后，广州虽然也为反革命的势力所统治，但是，经过大革命锻炼的、觉悟了的广州工人、农民和一部分爱国青年知识分子，并没有被白色恐怖吓倒。相反的，他们团结得更加紧密了，在共产党的领导下，继续进行着英勇的斗争。我们回到广州后，更加鼓舞了他们的斗争情绪，革命的气焰更益高涨。被国民党破坏的工会组织又恢复起来了，游行示威的声势越来越大，郊区的农民运动也有新的发展。
    广州的革命群众曾对张发奎抱着很大的幻想，他们渴望着由北伐军剩下的最后这支武装能领导他们继续革命。南下时，张发奎也还表示愿意回广东继续革命，可是当他看到广州人民这种高涨的革命气焰时，却又摇动了，最后终于脱下了假左派的外衣，露出其原来的反动面貌，并与汪精卫勾结一起，在广州市内大肆镇压工农运动，捕杀共产党员。这个一度曾是全国革命灯塔的城市，而今也为反革命的阴云所笼罩，黑暗代替了光明，革命的力量遭到了严重的摧残。面前的事实清楚地告诉了共产党人：只有拿起武器领导工农群众起来暴动，否则革命力量必将受到残酷摧残。11月28日，广东省委根据党中央指示，做出了在广州发动工农兵举行武装起义的决定。
    一年多以前，一个热火朝天的北伐革命，犹如燎原之火，从广州烧到南昌、烧到武汉、烧遍了整个长江流域。而曾几何时，由于帝国主义的干涉，蒋介石的叛变革命，这股燎原之火几遭扑灭，仅剩下星星火种！中国共产党和中国革命人民，在此历史紧要关头，继续高举革命大旗，把这星星之火，又从武汉烧到南昌、烧到南方各省、烧到了北伐的策源地——广州。
    当时张发奎统治下的广州，正处于不稳定状态：陈铭枢部由汕头向广州进军，黄绍竑部在梧州集结，也有进袭广州的模样。张发奎不得不集中全力来巩固自己地盘，决定先对付桂系，然后再对付陈铭枢，于是任命黄琪翔为前敌总指挥，把所有的兵力调离广州，开赴肇庆、梧州一带，与黄绍竑作战。同时又把缴了枪的教导团重新武装起来，以防守广州。广州实际上只有教导团、及新编成的一个警卫团和一部分警察武装，敌人内部非常空虚。
    这是举行武装起义的大好时机。广东省委看到这一形势，立即成立了“行动委员会”，加紧起义的准备工作，把各个工人组织统一组成工人赤卫队，并秘密地发给武器，把他们武装起来；通过党的关系，把大批党的军事干部和省港罢工工人秘密地派进警卫团，使警卫团基本上掌握在我们党的手里。12月7日，“行动委员会”秘密举行工农兵代表大会，选出执行委员会，决定13日起义。
    广州工人阶级高涨的革命气焰，引起了帝国主义与国民党的注视与警惕，再加上他们得到了我们要在广州起义的消息，便加紧从中破坏。在帝国主义与南京国民党的授意下，张发奎匆匆调回了前敌总指挥黄琪翔，并准备解散教导团；同时在10日宣布特别戒严令，日夜不停地检查户口。远离广州的反动军队，也开始向广州活动。在此情况下，“行动委员会”不得不把起义时间提前到11日。
    11日早晨二时许，被反动派称为“赤子赤孙”的教导团学员，在枪毙了张发奎派来的特务参谋长和一些反动军官后，立即投入了市内的战斗。与此同时，潜伏在市内各地的工人赤卫队，犹如万箭齐发，攻向各个指定的目标；警卫团也在团长梁秉枢率领下，解除了一部分反动军官和士兵的武装后宣布起义。仅一个多小时，教导团第一营和工人赤卫队第一联队即粉碎了敌人在铁甲车掩护下的负隅顽抗，攻占了最坚固的反动堡垒公安局，并在那里成立了苏维埃政府。其他各路起义队伍，也先后占领了无线电局、邮政局、各区警察署，以及其他国民党的党政机关。红旗几乎插遍全市，大街小巷挂满了红布横额，墙上写满了工农革命的标语。仅仅几个小时前被反革命阴云所笼罩的广州，现在又变成了沸腾的、洋溢着胜利的广州了。
    必须指出，帝国主义的武装干涉，使起义军处于不利的地位。英、美、日等帝国主义，除了出动炮舰不断向我市区轰击外，还派海军陆战队在长堤一带登陆。法帝国主义也参加了这一干涉。在帝国主义军舰的掩护下，市内反革命部队向我展开了猛烈的反扑。广州郊外的敌人，也准备前来增援。起义开始后不久，起义总指挥部讨论了当前局势，当时曾提出：应该迅速停止枪声，建立市内的革命秩序，对一切尚未攻下的残余据点，应包围监视，在政治上瓦解他们，争取他们；应该以教导团为基础，迅速扩建军队，把工人赤卫队和教导团合编成立三个师；将战线推向郊外，发动农民、组织农民队伍，以便迎击前来增援的敌人。大家认为这些措施是正确的，可惜时间已不容许我们这样做，敌人在帝国主义军舰的帮助下进展很快，我们还来不及在市内建立革命秩序，来不及以教导团为中心扩编武装力量，更来不及把战线推到郊外，敌人已从三面围上来了。从江门赶来的薛岳部，从韶关赶来的许志锐部，以及从石龙赶来的李汉魂部，很快又抢占了市内主要据点。在敌强我弱的形势下，经三昼夜英勇奋战的起义部队，不得不撤出了广州。
    大革命的失败，固然是由于国民党的叛变和帝国主义的干涉，但从工人阶级政党内部来说，经验不足，领导机关所犯的错误，也是革命遭致失败的原因。大革命一开始，还是处于幼年时代的中国共产党，虽然那时候就已懂得了武装斗争的重要，但认识还是不足的，而且缺乏积极、正确的方针。特别是大革命后期，由于陈独秀的机会主义领导，不敢放手发动群众、武装群众，不去积极掌握军队，把革命的希望寄托在资产阶级身上，幻想通过和平方式取得无产阶级革命的胜利。这样，就使党没有充分的力量来防止国民党的叛变，和粉碎他们叛变后对革命的进攻。大革命的失败，深刻地教育了中国共产党人，使他们从惨痛的教训中彻底认识了：中国革命只能由共产党来领导，资产阶级以及其它一切阶层都不能领导中国革命取得彻底的胜利；中国革命的主要形式不可能是和平的，而只能是武装的革命反对武装的反革命；中国革命必须要有自己的革命的军队，没有革命军队就没有革命的一切。南昌起义、秋收起义、广州起义，以及其他各地的武装起义，就是在这个认识基础上发起的。这是坚决的、也是艰苦的大转变。由此起点，便开始了土地革命战争——由共产党单独领导的工农革命，并开始创建了中国人民自己的军队——中国工农红军。
    因此，广州起义就绝不是消极的“退兵之一战”，而是在这个转折关头，党为了挽救革命，为了粉碎反革命的猖狂进攻，奋起领导革命人民，向反革命势力进行的一次积极的、英勇的反击。正如毛主席在“论联合政府”一书中所说的：英雄的中国共产党和中国革命人民
  “并没有被吓倒，被征服，被杀绝。他们从地下爬起来，揩干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了。”
    广州起义虽然失败了，但并没有完全失败，从广州撤出的一部分起义武装，后来又分别与东江、左右江一带的农民起义武装会合，把革命种籽传播到广大农村，继续进行着革命斗争。
    广州起义留下的教训是多方面的，其中主要的一条是：无产阶级先锋队要派自己的干部下乡。当时革命已经转入低潮，在敌强我弱的条件下，革命最迫切的任务不可能马上夺取城市，而是如何保存力量，把它转入反革命势力薄弱的农村，组织、发动广大农民进行游击战争，建立和发展农村根据地，并依靠农村包围城市，最后夺取城市，取得革命胜利。革命离开了巩固的工农联盟，没有农民积极参加，胜利是不可能的。可是这些教训，直到广州起义失败以后相当长的时期内，还没有被一些党的领导同志所认识。我们当时的头脑，还充满着资产阶级旧民主主义革命的以城市为根据地的思想，对农民的力量没有正确的认识。只有毛主席在领导中国革命的实际斗争中，根据马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，结合中国民族特点，创造性地解决了这一关系着中国革命成败的根本问题，并依据这一原理，指导革命在中国取得了胜利。如果广州起义不留恋城市，在起义之后自觉地、主动地迅速向农村发展，与当时正蓬勃发展着的海陆丰农民运动相配合，建立农村根据地，开展以土地革命为中心内容的游击战争，那么，起义将会取得更大的胜利。
