Xiaoyuxiang's Path is Correct
Five Days and Nights of Hard Work to Achieve Mechanization of Transporting and Cultivating Soil, Labor Shortage Transformed into Surplus

According to the Shanxi Daily: Under the leadership of the CCP Linfen County Xiaoyuxiang Committee, the people of the entire township worked hard for five days and nights to realize the mechanization of vehicles, stem coating, and soil cultivation throughout the township. Everything from transportation in the fields to pest control and weeding for cotton is completely replaced by native machinery. The labor shortage throughout the township was readily resolved.

With the Great Leap Forward in production, labor became extremely scarce. Xiaoyuxiang is a medium-sized township comprising six agricultural cooperatives with nearly two thousand households. The entire township has more than 23,000 mu of land, over 3,500 laborers, and 963 livestock. In mid-June, wheat urgently needed to be harvested; cotton was waiting for thinning, setting seedlings, pest control, and weeding; replanting and fertilizer delivery also needed to be carried out in conjunction. Basic agricultural construction also required drawing 1,400 workers to the "July 1st" Canal to deliver bricks, crush stones, and excavate earthworks. In this way, labor was even more insufficient for distribution.

What to do about this? The CCP Xiaoyuxiang Committee was determined to make the greatest effort to find an answer to the "difficult problem."

Coincidentally, the county held a Party Congress at this time, and the meeting proposed: carry out mass suggestion and advice, vigorously launch the tool reform movement, which is the main measure to ensure increased grain and cotton production. After grasping this magic weapon, the CCP Xiaoyuxiang Committee immediately conveyed and implemented it at the work team, township, and cooperative cadre meeting on June 16. The meeting focused on resolving the current "contradiction between the requirements of the Great Leap Forward in production and the shortage of labor and low labor productivity" and launched a heated discussion and study. Everyone agreed that agricultural tool reform was a clever plan and a superior strategy to solve this contradiction. In the actual work of mobilizing the masses, the masses' three fears (fear of poor reform, unusable, being laughed at; fear of wasting time and materials, no remuneration; fear of delaying production by reforming agricultural tools) and one superstition (only believing that blacksmiths can do it) were discovered and resolved. As a result, the wisdom of the masses seemed to bloom like spring flowers, and revolutionary zeal soared to the sky. A mass agricultural tool reform movement was launched vigorously. On the night of June 18, more than 200 people in the Xifang Xinghua Cooperative reformed 180 vehicles. The hard work spirit of the Ximace Wuxing Cooperative was also very strong. On the night of June 22, 132 people completed 109 vehicles; on the night of the 23rd, 15 people completed 32 cultivators.

After five days and nights of hard work by the people of the entire township, the good news of the vehicle revolution in each cooperative was posted all over the walls of the township people's committee. As of the end of June, the township had reformed a total of 4,680 agricultural tools, including 1,850 vehicles, 520 cultivators, and 2,310 stem coating devices. The most outstanding reform was the cultivator, which had as many as nine varieties. Efficiency increased 24 times. Now the entire township is using all 520 cultivators, using 520 human power and 520 animal power, and can cultivate the entire township's 8,290 mu of cotton once in one day; if the past handicraft-like hoeing method is still used, one person can hoe six fen per day, and 520 people would have to hoe for 26 days. Comparing the former and the latter saves 13,000 man-days.

The process of agricultural tool reform is also a process of educating people. In order to further break the shackles of superstition on people's minds and open the mysterious door of scientific and technological knowledge, the CCP Xiaoyuxiang Committee then held an agricultural tool reform exhibition and a field meeting on agricultural tool reform. Now the tool reform movement in the entire township is being carried out on a larger scale.

    小榆乡的路子走得对
    苦战五昼夜实现运输中耕土机械化，劳力不足变有余
    据山西日报讯　在中共临汾县小榆乡委员会的领导下，全乡人民奋力苦战五个昼夜，全乡实现了车辆化、涂茎、中耕土机械化，从田间的运输直到棉花的除虫、锄草完全由土机械代替了。全乡缺乏劳力的困难迎刃而解。
    随着生产的大跃进劳力显得十分缺乏。小榆乡是一个包括六个农业社，拥有近两千户的中型乡。全乡共有土地二万三千余亩，劳力三千五百多个，牲口九百六十三头。6月中旬，小麦急需收割；棉花正待间苗、定苗、除虫和锄草；复播、送肥也要结合进行。农业基本建设还要抽一千四百个工到“七一”渠上送砖、砸石、挖土方。这样，劳力就更不敷分配了。
    这怎么办呢？中共小榆乡委员会决心尽最大的努力要找到解决“难题”的答案。
    恰巧县里这时召开了党代会，会上提出了：开展群众性的献计献策，大力展开工具改革运动，这是保证粮棉增产的主要措施。中共小榆乡委员会掌握这个法宝后，随即于6月16日在工作组、乡、社干部会议上作了传达和贯彻。会上以解决当前出现的“生产大跃进的要求同劳动力不足、劳动生产率低下之间的矛盾”为主要内容，展开了热烈的讨论和研究。大家一致认为：农具改革是解决这个矛盾的妙计和上策。在发动群众的实际工作中又发现和解决了社员群众的三怕（怕改革不好，不能用，别人笑话；怕误时、费料，没报酬；怕改革农具误生产。）和一迷信（只迷信铁木匠会做）的思想。于是，群众的智慧好像春花怒放，革命干劲冲天，一个群众性的农具改革运动风起云涌地开展起来了。6月18日的一个夜晚，席坊兴华社二百余人改革了车子一百八十辆。西麻册五星社的苦战精神也很强，在6月22日的一夜间，一百三十二人完成车子一百零九辆；23日夜间十五人完成中耕器三十二件。
    经过全乡人民五个昼夜的苦战，各社车辆化的喜报贴满了乡人民委员会的墙壁。据6月底止，全乡共改革农具四千六百八十件，其中：车子一千八百五十辆，中耕器五百二十部，涂茎器二千三百一十件。改制的最突出的要算中耕器，其花样有九种之多。效率提高二十四倍。现在全乡将所有的五百二十部中耕器全部运用起来，用五百二十个人力和五百二十个畜力，在一天内就可将全乡的八千二百九十亩棉花中耕一次；如果仍用过去手工业似的锄地法，一人一天以锄六分计，五百二十个人就得锄二十六天。前者和后者比，节省人工一万三千个。
    农具改革的过程，也是教育人的过程，中共小榆乡委员会为了进一步打破迷信思想对于人们的束缚，打开科学技术的奥妙神秘之门，接着举办了农具改革展览会，召开了农具改革现场会。现在全乡工具改革运动更大规模地开展起来了。
