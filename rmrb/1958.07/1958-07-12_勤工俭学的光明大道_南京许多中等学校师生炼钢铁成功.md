The Bright Road of Work-Study Programs
Teachers and Students in Many Secondary Schools in Nanjing Successfully Smelt Steel

    (Our Dispatch) Encouraged by the call for "Steel Taking the Lead," teachers and students in many secondary schools in Nanjing have been using crucibles to trial-smelt steel. Now, No. 1 Middle School, No. 2 Middle School, No. 3 Middle School, No. 10 Middle School, No. 19 Middle School, Municipal Normal School and other schools have successfully smelted iron; and the Affiliated High School of Nanjing Normal University, No. 9 Middle School, No. 10 Middle School, No. 11 Middle School, No. 5 Girls' Middle School, Municipal Normal School and others have successfully smelted steel.

    The students in Nanjing middle schools were very excited when they heard that the schools were going to smelt steel. After the Party Branch of No. 10 Middle School made a mobilization report to the whole school on June 27, the students signed up enthusiastically, proposing to be steel soldiers and steel smelting shock brigades. That evening, more than a dozen representatives from Class 3 of Senior 2 visited the automobile factory, watched the steel tapping, and drew a diagram of the furnace. They immediately built the furnace after returning to school. The six students in the foundry group of No. 11 Middle School had never seen steel smelting before. Under the guidance of the physics teacher, they worked for three nights and smelted the first furnace of steel. The students of No. 5 Girls' Middle School also broke the superstition that "female students cannot smelt steel" and, with the strong help of the workers from the First Machine Tool Factory, smelted the steel. They said: "Normally, we have to fan ourselves for a long time after sweating a little, but in front of the steel smelting furnace, we don't feel the heat even at a temperature of over a thousand degrees."

    In the process of steel smelting, the students overcame many difficulties such as lack of equipment and technical knowledge. The students of No. 11 Middle School used a mixture of yellow mud and white mud to build the furnace body. Without a blower, they first used hand-pulled bellows, and later, they used a small electric motor from the school and installed blades to make a small blower. Without raw materials, some students brought refractory bricks from home; others picked up scrap iron.

    Through steel smelting, the students' study life has been closely integrated with the current situation of the motherland. Some students said: "In the past, I thought that catching up with England was a matter for the central government, but this understanding is wrong. Everyone should do it." Some students were not very confident about catching up with England in the past, but after steel smelting, their confidence was greatly increased. They said: "Even we can smelt steel and draw glass filaments, it won't take a few years to catch up with England." The students' steel smelting not only broke down superstitious ideas but also enriched their practical knowledge; it also opened up a broader road for work-study programs.

    At present, No. 10 Middle School, No. 11 Middle School, the Affiliated High School of Nanjing Normal University and other schools are actively building blast furnaces and making necessary equipment by themselves, developing from one furnace to several furnaces, and also striving to smelt stainless steel and alloy steel. On the evening of the 7th, No. 10 Middle School had already successfully produced coke using indigenous methods. This school plans to produce 200 tons of steel and 250 tons of iron this year; the Affiliated High School of Nanjing Normal University plans to produce 150 tons of steel and 200 tons of iron this year. Many schools such as No. 13 Middle School, Kindergarten Normal School, Geology, Telecommunications, Power, and Electricity have recently visited advanced units such as No. 10 Middle School and No. 11 Middle School for steel smelting and are actively preparing for iron and steel smelting. The students of the Kindergarten Normal School are all female, and they themselves use flatbed carts to drag the green bricks on campus to Xiaguan, far away from the school, to exchange them for refractory bricks, and make blowers themselves, determined to build their own blast furnace as soon as possible.

    Since the work-study program of Dongguang County Junior Middle School in Hebei Province was launched in March this year, it has reclaimed more than 720 mu of wasteland and established a granular fertilizer factory and a pig farm. Female students have also organized a shoe processing factory. The picture shows teachers and students producing granular fertilizer.

    勤工俭学的光明大道
    南京许多中等学校师生炼钢铁成功
    本报讯　南京市许多中等学校的师生，在“钢铁一马当先”的号召下，纷纷用坩埚试炼钢铁。现在已有一中、二中、三中、十中、十九中、市立师范等学校炼铁成功；南师附中、九中、十中、十一中、五女中、市立师范等炼钢成功。
    南京各中学的学生们听说学校要炼钢铁，十分兴奋。十中党支部在6月27日向全校作了动员后，同学们纷纷报名，他们提出要做钢铁子弟兵、炼钢突击队。当晚高二（3）班就派了十多个代表到汽车制造厂参观，看了出钢，画下了炉子的图样。回校后立即砌炉子。十一中铸工组六个同学从来没有见过炼钢，他们在物理老师指导下，干了三个夜晚，炼出了第一炉钢。五女中的同学也打破了“女同学不能炼钢”的迷信，在第一机械厂工人同志的大力帮助下，把钢炼出来了。她们说：“平常出一点汗就要扇好久，在炼钢炉面前，一千多度的高温也不觉得热了。”
    在炼钢过程中，学生们克服了既无设备，又不懂技术等许多困难。十一中同学用黄泥和白泥混合砌成了炉体。没有鼓风机，他们先用手拉风箱，后来，用学校的一只小电动机装上叶片，制成一架小鼓风机。没有原材料，有的学生从家里抬来耐火砖；有的捡来了废铁。
    通过炼钢铁，学生的学习生活与祖国当前形势紧密地结合起来了。有的同学说：“过去我认为赶英国是中央的事，这种认识是不对的。我们人人都应该动手。”有些同学过去对于赶英国信心不太大，经过炼钢以后，大大提高了信心。他们说：“连我们都能炼钢铁，抽玻璃丝，赶英国要不了几年。”同学们炼钢铁不仅打破了迷信思想，而且丰富了实际知识；也为勤工俭学打开更为广阔的道路。
    目前，十中、十一中、南师附中等学校正积极兴建高炉，自制必要的设备。由一个炉子发展到几个炉子，还争取炼不锈钢和合金钢。十中在7日晚上已经用土法炼焦成功，这个学校计划今年炼出二百吨钢，二百五十吨铁；南师附中准备今年生产钢一百五十吨，铁二百吨。十三中、幼师、地质、电信、动力、电力等许多学校近来纷纷参观了十中、十一中等炼钢的先进单位，并正在积极筹备炼铁炼钢。幼儿师范都是女学生，她们自己用板车拖着校内的青砖，到远离学校的下关去换取耐火砖，自己动手制作鼓风机，决心尽快建成自己的高炉。

    河北省东光县初级中学的勤工俭学活动从今年3月开展以来，已经开辟了七百二十多亩荒地，并建立了颗粒肥料制造厂、养猪场。女学生们还组织了鞋业加工厂。图为师生们正在生产颗粒肥料。
