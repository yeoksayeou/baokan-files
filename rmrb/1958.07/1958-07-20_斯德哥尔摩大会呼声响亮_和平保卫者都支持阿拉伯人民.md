Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm Telegram - The Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference continued its plenary session on the afternoon of the 16th. At the meeting, a letter from Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, to the conference was read out first, and then the conference speeches began. A total of five representatives spoke at the afternoon meeting.

The first day of the conference ended with the adoption of a resolution condemning the American aggression against Lebanon. This new act of disrupting peace by American imperialism immediately became the primary concern of the conference delegates.

The first speaker, Mrs. R. Nehru (India), strongly protested the American armed intervention in her speech and expressed her support for the people of Lebanon and Iraq. She said: The entry of foreign troops into Lebanon and Iraq would constitute a grave danger to the stability of the Middle East and world peace. My fellow Indians and I firmly believe that the people of all countries have the inherent right to choose the form of government they prefer. Any foreign intervention is a violation of the United Nations Charter. Our sympathies are entirely on the side of the countries of Iraq and Lebanon. We declare our solidarity with them. Mrs. R. Nehru's words were repeatedly greeted with warm applause by the conference.

The speech by Mrs. O. Poblete (Chile) deeply impressed the conference and aroused everyone's emotions. She pointed out that a high tide of people from all countries striving for freedom and independence is rising in the world. She said: The Afro-Asian solidarity movement is a great force for peace. It is also a great movement to defend the right of people to self-determination. On behalf of the people of Latin America, she expressed admiration and support for the Afro-Asian people who bravely oppose foreign oppression. She said: The struggle of the people of Latin America for national democratic rights is encouraged by the Afro-Asian solidarity movement.

She said: We must not be afraid to use firm will to deal with those who pursue war. We must dig out their political and economic roots, expose their true faces, and expose their conspiracy to soften the people's struggle.

She said: The Arab people's demand for national independence is a very meaningful thing in our time. We are defenders of peace and should express our support for them.

She said: The American aggression against Lebanon, with the consent of Britain, is an open interference in the internal affairs of other countries. This new aggression will surely arouse greater disgust and contempt for imperialism. She said: Now it is no longer the foreign ministries of colonial countries that decide our destiny. It is impossible for imperialism to want us to live in the past era.

Finally, she said in a loud voice: "The people of all countries in the world should have the same equal status." Her speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause.

Yasui Iku, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said that the conference must give new impetus to the forces of peace. The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs believes that the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons testing will play a historically significant role in moving towards a complete ban on nuclear weapons. Taking advantage of the encouraging opportunity provided by this Soviet decision, we should do our utmost to strive for the conclusion of an international agreement banning all nuclear weapons testing. He then pointed out that in the Far East, conspiracies are developing regarding a military bloc in Northeast Asia. Nuclear weapons and missiles are being transported into Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. He expressed the determination of the Japanese people to strengthen the mass movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs to oppose these conspiracies.

Yasui Iku said: Establishing normal diplomatic relations between Japan and the People's Republic of China is an urgent task of the Japanese people.

Bernal (Britain), Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, and Lundqvist (Sweden) spoke at the meeting on disarmament and cultural exchange issues, respectively.

    斯德哥尔摩大会呼声响亮
    和平保卫者都支持阿拉伯人民
    据新华社斯德哥尔摩电　裁军和国际合作大会16日下午继续举行全体会议。在会议上首先宣读了世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里致大会的信件，然后开始大会发言。共有五位代表在下午的会议上作了发言。
    第一天的大会以通过谴责美国侵略黎巴嫩的决议而结束。美帝国主义这个新的破坏和平的行为立即成为大会代表们首先注意的问题。
    第一个发言者拉·尼赫鲁夫人（印度）在她的发言中强烈抗议美国的武装干涉，并且表示支持黎巴嫩和伊拉克的人民。她说：外国军队进入黎巴嫩和伊拉克会构成对中东的稳定和世界和平的严重危险。我和印度人民坚信，一切国家的人民都有选择他们所喜欢的政府的形式的天赋权利。任何外来的干涉都是对联合国宪章的破坏。我们的同情是完全在伊拉克和黎巴嫩国家这一边的。我们宣布，我们对他们声援。大会一再以热烈的掌声欢迎拉·尼赫鲁夫人的这些话。
    智利代表奥·波布列特夫人的发言给大会以深刻的印象，引起大家情绪的高涨。她指出：世界上掀起了一个各国人民争取自由和独立的高潮。她说：亚非团结运动是一支很大的和平力量。这也是保卫人民自决权的大运动。她代表拉丁美洲的人民向勇敢反对外国压迫的亚非人民表示钦佩和支持。她说：拉丁美洲的人民争取民族民主权利的斗争受到亚非团结运动的鼓舞。
    她说：我们不要害怕用坚决意志来对付那些追求战争的人们。要把他们的政治、经济根源挖出来，暴露他们真正的面貌，揭露他们软化人民斗争的阴谋。
    她说：阿拉伯人民要求民族独立，这是我们时代一个很有意义的事。我们是和平的保卫者，应该对他们表示支持。
    她说：得到英国同意的美国对黎巴嫩的侵略，是公开干涉他国内政。这种新的侵略一定会引起大家对帝国主义更加厌恶、鄙弃。她说：现在决定我们命运的已经不是殖民国家的外交部了。帝国主义还想要我们生活在从前的时代，这是不可能的。
    最后她以响亮的声音说：“世界各国人民都应有同样的平等地位”。她的发言一再被掌声打断。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁发言说：大会必须给予和平力量以新的动力。日本反对原子弹和氢弹协议会认为，苏联单方面停止核武器试验在向着完全禁止核武器前进方面将起具有历史意义的重要作用。利用苏联这一决定所提供的令人鼓舞的机会，我们应当尽最大努力来争取缔结禁止一切核武器试验的国际协定。他接着指出，在远东关于东北亚军事集团的阴谋正在发展。核武器和导弹正在被运入日本、台湾和南朝鲜。他表示日本人民决心加强反对原子弹和氢弹的群众运动，来反对这些阴谋。
    安井郁说：建立日本和中华人民共和国的正常外交关系是日本人民迫切的任务。
    世界和平理事会副主席贝尔纳（英国）和伦德奎斯特（瑞典）分别在会上作了关于裁军问题和文化交流问题的发言。
