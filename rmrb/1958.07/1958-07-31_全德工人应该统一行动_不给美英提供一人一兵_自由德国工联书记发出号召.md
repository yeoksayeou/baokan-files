Xinhua News Agency, July 29th. According to a report from the German News Agency (DPA) in Prague on July 28th: Kirchner, a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council and Secretary of the Free German Trade Union Federation, stated to journalists from the German Democratic Republic in Prague that the most urgent task currently is to extinguish the torches in the hands of the Anglo-American aggressors in the Middle East through the united action of all workers worldwide. No one should be under the illusion that this armed intervention is merely a regional conflict involving the countries concerned.

He emphasized: If aircraft continue to take off from West German territory to support the aggression, and are doing so with the help of the West German government, then in the event of a world war, one must consider the immense danger of a fatal counterattack against the West German supply bases that serve the aggression. Such a counterattack would have devastating consequences for the German people. Faced with this immense danger, we tell all trade union members: West Germany must no longer continue to be a military springboard for Anglo-American aggression. Do not provide a single person, a single soldier, a single action for the offensive against the Arab people. To repel the grave danger of war, united action is the urgent requirement of the present.

Kirchner called on the workers of the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to immediately discuss common steps to strengthen the forces of action and to issue protests to the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, demanding an immediate halt to the aggression. He also demanded that the industrial trade unions of West Germany take action.

    全德工人应该统一行动
    不给美英提供一人一兵
    自由德国工联书记发出号召
    新华社29日讯　据德意志通讯社布拉格28日讯：世界工会联合会理事会理事、自由德国工会联合会书记基希纳在布拉格向德意志民主共和国的记者们发表谈话，他说，通过全世界一切工人的联合行动来打掉中东的英美侵略者手上的火把是当前最紧急的任务。谁都不应该幻想以为这次武装干涉只是牵涉到有关国家的地区性的冲突。
    他强调指出：如果飞机不断地从西德的领土上起飞去支持侵略，而且还在西德政府的帮助之下这样做，那么在一旦发生世界大战的时候，就必须估计到导致对为侵略服务的西德补给基地进行致命反击的巨大危险。这种反击对于德国人民将有毁灭性的后果。面对着这种巨大的危险，我们告诉一切工会会员们：西德必须不再继续做美英侵略的军事跳板。不要为进攻阿拉伯人民提供一个人、一名士兵、一个行动。为了击退严重的战争危险，采取联合行动是当前的迫切要求。
    基希纳号召德意志民主共和国和西德的工人们立刻讨论共同步骤，以便加强行动的力量并向美国和英国的政府发出抗议，要求立刻停止侵略，他并且要求西德的产业工人工会行动起来。
