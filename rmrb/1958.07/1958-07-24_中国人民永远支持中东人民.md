    The Chinese People Will Always Support the People of the Middle East
    Whatever Our Arab Brothers Need, We Will Give
    We, the people of Qu Tou Township in Tongzhou District, Beijing, protest with utmost anger the armed aggression of the US and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan, and express our full support for the just struggle of our Arab brothers against imperialism.

    In order to achieve their goal of continuing to enslave the people of the Middle East, the US and British imperialists have resorted to gangster methods to invade Lebanon and Jordan, attempting to use force to suppress the national liberation movement of the people of the Middle East. This approach by the US and British imperialists does not demonstrate their strength at all, but only shows their immense fear of the people of the Middle East. The surging anti-imperialist tide of the people of the Middle East has frightened the imperialists into panic, causing them to jump over the wall like desperate dogs, intervening without even bothering to disguise themselves.

    The yield of our township's summer harvest crops this year has doubled compared to previous years. The autumn harvest crops will increase several times over. If the imperialists dare to provoke war, the ten thousand people of Qu Tou Township are determined to join the people of the whole country in fully supporting the just struggle of our Arab brothers. Whatever our Arab brothers need, we will give them, until final victory is achieved.
                                        The Entire People of Qu Tou Township, Tongzhou District
    The Culprit of Disrupting World Peace
    All the overseas Chinese students in our college protest with extreme anger the US and British imperialists' armed interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Jordan. We fully support the statements issued by our government and the Soviet government, demanding that the US and British governments immediately withdraw their aggressive troops from Lebanon and Jordan. We are all overseas Chinese who have just returned to the country not long ago, and have personally experienced the enslavement and persecution of the imperialists. Therefore, we especially cannot tolerate this kind of aggression. We fully support the just struggle of the Arab people. We regard this struggle as our own struggle, and we are happy for every victory achieved by the Arab people, and angry at the aggression suffered by the Arab people.

    The shameless act of aggression by the US and British imperialists makes it clear to people that they are the culprits of disrupting world peace and creating the threat of war, and a group of arsonists. They not only ignite the flames of war in the Middle East, but also plant the sparks of war all over the world, establishing aggressive bases everywhere. In order to defend world peace, we also firmly demand that the US aggressor troops get out of our territory of Taiwan!
                                  All Overseas Chinese Students of Beijing Normal College
    Aggressors Are Our Deadly Enemies
    When we heard that the US and British imperialist aggressors were frantically carrying out armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, seriously undermining world peace, we could no longer suppress the anger in our hearts. We solemnly protest the shameless aggression of the American and British pirates against the Arab people.

    The US and British imperialists have always been the deadly enemies of the peace-loving people of the world. They have launched wars of aggression against Korea and Egypt, massacring innocent people, and the US imperialists still occupy our territory of Taiwan to this day. Today, they want to put their butcher knives on the heads of the people of the Middle East. We must not allow the aggressors to do evil and run rampant. We are soldiers of the people, and it is our duty as soldiers to defend the territorial integrity of our motherland and to defend world peace. The aggressors are our deadly enemies. We solemnly warn the US and Britain and their invading armies that if you are determined to be enemies of the peace-loving people of the world, and do not quickly get out of the Middle East, Taiwan, and all occupied areas, we will never stand idly by.

    Drive the Imperialists Out of the Middle East
    I am a returned overseas Chinese from Korea. In 1950, the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea. On October 2, 1951, my home was burned down by the imperialist aggressors. My younger sister died in this war. Later, the whole family hid in air-raid shelters, afraid to come out. I risked my life to climb the mountains to scrape some bark and mixed it with bean cakes to feed my family. One day, I saw with my own eyes a Korean woman carrying her own son, who was bombed to death by the planes of the imperialist bandits on the side of the road. The child lay on his mother's body crying and calling out to his mother! I also saw with my own eyes the American bandits kill and bomb to death many Koreans and Chinese expatriates. However, the Korean people, with the support of the Chinese People's Volunteers, finally drove away the imperialist bandits. Now, the imperialist aggressors do not learn from their failure to invade Korea, and are invading Lebanon and Jordan, which is truly infuriating!

    I have personally tasted the pain of imperialist aggression, so I am particularly angry at this atrocity committed by the US and British imperialists against the Arab people. I wish I could throw the imperialists into the steelmaking furnace and burn them to ashes! I want to shout: US and British bandits, get out of Lebanon and Jordan, and US imperialist bandits, get out of our territory of Taiwan!

    Support the People of the Middle East with Practical Actions of Technological Revolution
    We, all the staff and workers of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau and Mang'ai Working Committee, express our great indignation at the piratical actions of the US and British imperialists and lodge a serious protest.

    We pledge to stand with the Arab people, to support the just struggle of the Arab people and defend world peace with practical actions of going all out, aiming high, and building our socialist country faster, better, and more economically, accelerating our socialist construction, and launching a technological revolution and a movement of ten thousand inventions and creations.
                                 All Staff and Workers of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau and Mang'ai Working Committee

    Imperialism Must Not Be Allowed to Act Tyrannically
    The US and British imperialists' armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan is a blatant aggression against the entire Arab people, and an open provocation against all peace-loving countries and people in the world.

    We firmly support our government's statement against US armed aggression against Lebanon and its serious warning against British imperialist aggression against Jordan. We warn the US and British imperialists that the current world situation is one in which the East wind prevails over the West wind. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the strength of all peace-loving forces in the world are incomparably powerful, and the imperialists will never be allowed to act tyrannically.

    We must, under the leadership of the Party and the government, transform our indignation into strength and resolutely oppose US and British imperialist aggression against the Middle East, and support the just struggle of the Arab people with practical actions.
    People from all walks of life in the Xuanwu District Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Beijing

    Women's Protests
    We, all the women and mothers of the Water Resources and Electric Power Publishing House, express our serious protest to the US and British imperialists' unreasonable aggression against Lebanon and Jordan with utmost indignation.

    We Chinese women have long suffered from imperialist oppression and lived a life of misery. In order to achieve liberation, many mothers lost their sons and wives lost their husbands. Our happiness today was bought with the blood of countless heroes. We will never allow imperialism to ignite the flames of war in the Middle East again and suppress the Arab people's movement for national independence! We will never want the women of Lebanon and Jordan to sacrifice their sons and husbands as victims of war again!

    We now want to warn the US and British aggressors that the awakened Arab people cannot be intimidated. If you do not withdraw your troops quickly, the peace-loving people of the world will not spare you! Many of the women in our Water Resources and Electric Power Publishing House have participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and have already competed with US imperialism. In order to defend world peace, we want to fight the aggressors together with the Arab women.
                                 All Female Staff Members of the Water Resources and Electric Power Publishing House

    Angry Telegrams
    When we, in the remote border areas of our motherland, learned of the news of US and British imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and interference in the great national liberation movement of the people of the Middle East, we could no longer suppress the boundless anger in our hearts. We warn the US and British imperialists that if you do not immediately roll back from Lebanon and Jordan, the peace-loving people of the whole world will throw you jackals into the Mediterranean Sea!

             Including, Han Chinese Ding Xuanxue, Deng Yanwu, Bai ethnic group Sheng Yubiao, Naxi ethnic group He Jing, Tibetan ethnic groups Song Bolin, Chen Changshou, A Dui, Geng Dian

    Imperialism is the Deadly Enemy of the People of the World
    We, all the teachers, students, and staff of the Rongchang Animal Husbandry and Veterinary School in Sichuan Province, protest with utmost anger the US and British imperialist armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and the threat to the Republic of Iraq.

    From the actions of the US and British aggressors, we clearly see that imperialism is the deadly enemy of all the people in the world. It is unwilling to accept the liberation of oppressed nations and the vigorous development of the peaceful and democratic movement. At the same time, it is even more unwilling to accept its own demise. Therefore, when the Iraqi people achieved a great victory, it did not hesitate to remove its mask and blatantly send troops to interfere. We are determined to stand with the people of the Middle East and contribute all our strength to defeating the common enemy of the peace-loving people of the world—the US and British aggressors. We will, with the spirit of continuous revolution, work together with workers, peasants, and comrades in other work positions across the country, under the glorious illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism faster, better, and more economically, to strive to build our country into a strong socialist country as soon as possible and strengthen the forces for world peace.

    Finally, let us shout: US and British troops, get out of the Middle East immediately!
                             All Teachers, Students, and Staff of the Rongchang Animal Husbandry and Veterinary School in Sichuan Province

    The US and British Aggressors Will Never Be Able to Reverse the Wheels of History
    We fully support and endorse our government's decision to recognize the Republic of Iraq and its statement against US and British armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan.

    Today, the national liberation movement has become an unstoppable torrent. It is an inevitable development of history, and the colonial system is collapsing. However, the US and British imperialists have turned a blind eye,妄想扭转历史车轮, and want to use armed aggression to maintain their colonial rule over the Middle East. This is entirely wishful thinking.

    We warn the imperialists that the days when you could do whatever you want are gone forever. The people of Asia and Africa have stood up and become the masters of history. If you have no eyes and insist on banging your heads against a stone wall, then your fate will surely be to have your heads broken and bleeding.

    中国人民永远支持中东人民
    阿拉伯兄弟要什么，我们给什么
    我们北京市通州区渠头乡全乡人民，以无比愤怒的心情抗议美英武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，并表示全力支持阿拉伯兄弟人民反对帝国主义的正义斗争。
    美英帝国主义为了达到它们继续奴役中东人民的目的，竟采用强盗手段侵入黎巴嫩和约旦，企图用武力来镇压中东人民争取民族解放的运动。美英帝国主义的这种作法，决不表示它们的强大，只是表明了它们对中东人民的无比恐惧。中东人民的反帝浪潮汹涌澎湃的形势，已经吓得帝国主义惊慌失措，因而狗急跳墙，顾不得伪装就出来干涉了。
    我们乡今年夏收作物的产量比往年增加二倍。大秋作物将增加几倍。如果帝国主义竟敢挑起战争，我们渠头乡全乡一万人民决心和全国人民一道，全力支持阿拉伯兄弟人民的正义斗争，阿拉伯兄弟需要什么，我们就给什么，直到取得最后胜利为止。
                通州区渠头乡全体人民
    破坏世界和平的祸首
    我院全体华侨同学都以极端愤怒的心情，抗议美英帝国主义武装干涉黎巴嫩、约旦的内政。我们完全拥护我国政府和苏联政府发表的声明，要求美英政府立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出他们的侵略军队。我们都是从国外刚归国不久的华侨，亲身经历过帝国主义者的奴役和迫害。因此，我们特别不能容忍帝国主义的这种侵略行为。我们全力支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。我们把这个斗争看作我们自己的斗争，我们为阿拉伯人民所取得的每一个胜利而高兴，为阿拉伯人民遭到侵略而愤怒。
    美英帝国主义这种无耻的侵略行动，使人们清楚地看到，他们是破坏世界和平、制造战争威胁的祸首，是一批纵火犯。他们不仅在中东挑起战火，而且在全世界布下战争的火苗，在世界各地建立侵略基地。为了保卫世界和平，我们同时坚决要求美国侵略军从我国领土台湾滚出去！
                          北京师范学院全体华侨学生
    侵略者是我们的死对头
    我们听到美英帝国主义侵略者疯狂地对黎巴嫩约旦进行武装干涉，严重地破坏了世界和平时，再也按捺不住心头的怒火。我们严正抗议美英海盗对阿拉伯人民的这种无耻的侵略行为。
    美英帝国主义一直是世界爱好和平的人民的死敌。他们曾经发动侵朝、侵埃战争，屠杀了无辜的人民，而美帝国主义至今还霸占着我国的领土台湾。今天他们又想把屠刀搁在中东人民的头上。我们决不能让侵略者为非做歹，横行霸道。我们是人民的子弟兵，保卫祖国的领土完整和保卫世界和平，是我们军人的天职。侵略者就是我们的死对头。我们严正警告美英及其侵略军，如果你们坚决与世界爱好和平的人民为敌，不赶快从中东、台湾以及一切被霸占的地区滚回去，我们绝不会袖手旁观。

    把帝国主义赶出中东
    我是从朝鲜回来的归国华侨。1950年美帝国主义发动了侵朝战争，1951年10月2日那天，我的家被帝国主义侵略者给烧光了。我的小妹妹就死在这场战火中。后来全家人躲在防空洞里，不敢出来。我冒着生命的危险到山上刮些树皮，和豆饼混在一起供给全家吃。有一天，我亲眼看到一位朝鲜妇女背着亲生的儿子，被帝国主义强盗的飞机炸死在路旁，小孩伏在妈妈的身上哭着，叫着阿妈！我还亲眼看到美国强盗杀死和炸死了很多朝鲜人和中国侨民。可是，朝鲜人民在中国人民志愿军的支援下，终于把帝国主义强盗赶走了。现在帝国主义侵略者不从侵略朝鲜失败上吸取教训，又在侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，真让人愤恨！
    我亲身尝到过帝国主义侵略的痛苦，因此对美英帝国主义对阿拉伯人民的这种暴行，特别气愤，恨不能把帝国主义者推到炼钢炉里，把他们烧成灰！我要高呼：美英两国强盗滚出黎巴嫩和约旦，美帝国主义强盗滚出我国领土台湾去！　北京钢厂　张广兴
    用技术革命的实际行动支持中东人民
    我们青海石油勘探局和茫崖工委全体职工，对美英帝国主义者的海盗行为，表示极大愤慨，并提出严重抗议。
    我们誓与阿拉伯人民站在一起，以鼓足干劲，力争上游、多快好省地加速我国社会主义建设的实际行动，以大闹技术革命和万件发明创造运动，来支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，保卫世界和平。
                青海石油勘探局和茫崖工委　全体职工
            不许帝国主义横行霸道
    美英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，是对全体阿拉伯人民明目张胆的侵略，是对全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的公开挑衅。
    我们坚决拥护我国政府关于反对美国武装侵略黎巴嫩的声明，反对英帝国主义侵略约旦的严重警告。我们正告美英帝国主义者，现在世界形势是东风压倒西风，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量以及全世界爱好和平的力量，已无比强大，决不允许帝国主义者横行霸道。
    我们一定要在党和政府的领导下，化愤恨为力量，坚决反对美英帝国主义侵略中东，以实际行动支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。

          妇　女　们　的　抗　议
    我们水利电力出版社的全体妇女们、母亲们，怀着万分愤慨的心情向美、英帝国主义者无理侵略黎巴嫩和约旦提出严重的抗议。
    我们中国妇女曾经长期受过帝国主义的压迫，过着水深火热的生活。为了求得解放，许多母亲失去了儿子，妻子失去了丈夫。我们今天的幸福是用无数英雄的鲜血换来的。我们绝不允许帝国主义再在中东燃起战争的火焰，镇压阿拉伯人民争取民族独立的运动！我们绝不愿黎巴嫩和约旦的妇女再把自己的儿子和丈夫作为战争的牺牲品！
    我们现在要警告美、英侵略者，觉醒了的阿拉伯人民是吓不倒的，如果你们不赶快撤兵，全世界爱好和平的人民是不会饶恕你们的！我们水利电力出版社的许多妇女都是参加过抗美援朝战争的，已经和美帝国主义较量过。为了保卫世界和平，我们要和阿拉伯妇女们一起向侵略者进行斗争。
                      水利电力出版社全体女工作人员
            愤　怒　的　电　报
    当我们在遥远的祖国边疆获悉美英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，干涉中东人民伟大的民族解放运动的消息时，再也压制不住无比愤怒的心情。我们警告美英帝国主义，如果不立即从黎巴嫩和约旦滚回去，全世界爱好和平的人民会把你们这些豺狼扔进地中海去！

        帝国主义是世界人民的死敌
    我们四川省荣昌畜牧兽医学校全体师生员工，以万分愤怒的心情，抗议美英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，威胁伊拉克共和国。
    从美英侵略者的行为中，我们清楚地看到帝国主义是全世界人民的死敌。它对被压迫民族的解放，对和平民主运动的蓬勃发展，是不甘心的，同时它更不甘心自己的死亡，因而在伊拉克人民取得伟大胜利的时候，不惜放下假面具，悍然出兵干涉。我们坚决和中东人民一起，为击败世界爱好和平人民的共同敌人——美英侵略者而贡献出一切力量。我们将以不断革命的精神，同全国工人、农民及其他工作岗位上的同志一起，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，为尽快把我国建设成为社会主义强国，增强世界和平力量而努力奋斗。
    最后，让我们高呼：美英军队立即从中东滚出去！
                四川省荣昌畜牧兽医学校全体师生员工
        美英侵略者休想扭转历史车轮
    我们完全拥护和支持我国政府承认伊拉克共和国的决定和反对美英武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的声明。
    今天民族解放运动已经成为一股不可阻挡的洪流，它是历史的必然发展，殖民主义体系正在土崩瓦解。但是，美英帝国主义却瞎了眼睛，妄想扭转历史车轮，还想用武装侵略的办法，来维持他们对中东的殖民统治。这完全是痴心梦想。
    我们正告帝国主义者，你们为所欲为的时代是一去不复返了，亚非人民已经站起身来，成了历史的主人。你们如果有眼不识泰山，硬要把头往石头上撞，那么你们的下场一定是头破血流。
