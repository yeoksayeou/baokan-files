    On Laymen Leading Experts
    Huò Shēng
    Although the fallacy that laymen cannot lead experts has been refuted many times in the past year, there are still some unexhausted points worth discussing again. Human social practice proves that laymen leading experts is a general rule. It can be said that only laymen can lead experts, while experts cannot lead experts.
    The absolute sense of experts leading experts does not exist in real life. The so-called "field" naturally refers to various specialized disciplines, and the so-called "expert" naturally refers to someone proficient in specialized business. However, all fields are not static but develop with society. Every field becomes more and more specialized in its development, and therefore the field becomes more and more specific. For example, acting is a specialized field in the art world, but if further divided, there would be more specialized fields within it. Not only are spoken dramas and operas different, and Peking operas and local operas distinct, but even within a single opera genre, the roles of male, female, painted-face, old, and clown characters can each form their own specialized field. Anyone who is an expert in one profession is a layman in all professions outside of their own; hence the saying, "Every profession is like a separate mountain." This kind of specialization becomes increasingly significant within the realm of modern science and technology. Most people who specialize deeply are also those who specialize narrowly. For example, Mei Lanfang was a master of Peking Opera, but he only excelled at playing female roles (Dan). The Dan role is divided into Qingyi (serious female), Hua Dan (vivacious female), Wu Dan (martial female), Lao Dan (old female), and Chou Dan (clown female) categories, and he was only proficient in Qingyi. He sang Lao Dan roles not as well as Li Duokui, not to mention the other roles of male, painted-face, old, and clown characters.
    The more detailed the professional division of labor, the more indispensable professions are included in any enterprise, institution, or science, technology, and art organization. Just as a troupe must include all roles of male, female, painted-face, old, and clown characters in order to perform, in this situation, the absolute sense of experts leading experts is impossible, because one person can generally only be proficient in one or two professions, and is only a layman in other professions. Any leader can only be proficient in one or several professions within the industry they lead, and it is difficult to be an expert in all professions.
    People may argue that limiting the definition of an expert to proficiency in a specialized field is too narrow, and the scope should be broadened. For example, letting an actor who can perform lead a troupe is always slightly better than letting someone who cannot perform, even if they are not an expert in everything. No matter how the scope of the expert is defined, the fact is that anyone who considers themselves an expert cannot lead the work of that field well. If they can truly lead well, it must be because they have abandoned the airs of an expert and lead as a layman.
    All those who prominently flaunt their expert status have a pure technical viewpoint that is buried deep in their minds and dispenses with political leadership. In fact, technology without politics as the soul and commander will inevitably become a rigid and inflexible thing, without the power to solve any contradiction in practical struggles. The social practice of recent years has fully proven this truth: education experts are powerless to solve the contradiction between a single-track system and universal education; art experts are powerless to solve the contradiction between raising standards and popularizing culture in artistic activities; science and technology experts cannot solve the contradiction between advanced research and promoting mass inventions and creativity; and economic experts cannot solve the contradiction of imbalances arising from the high-speed development of socialist construction. Whether these contradictions can be resolved correctly is a major issue related to the fate of the country. All the experts are either helpless or retreat in the face of such big problems. It is our Party, whom some people call laymen, who have closely relied on the wisdom and strength of the people to correctly resolve these contradictions, enabling the people's creativity to be unleashed infinitely, thus enabling all professions to develop by leaps and bounds to an extent that experts in these fields dared not imagine. Doesn't this fully demonstrate that those who call themselves experts can only move forward under the leadership of those they call laymen!
    The essence of "laymen cannot lead experts" is the resistance of exploiting-class intellectuals to the leadership of the proletariat. Under the rule of the exploiting classes, the proletariat was deprived of the right to acquire knowledge and become experts. Making oneself an expert was the exclusive privilege of the exploiting classes and their intellectuals. The revolution overthrew the privileges of the exploiting classes, transforming the "crude and uncultured" proletariat into the ruling class. For the exploiting-class intellectuals, this was something they were both unwilling to accept and powerless to resist. They felt that the only thing they could console themselves with was that the knowledge in their minds was something that others could not take away. Thus, the slogan "laymen cannot lead experts" was put forward with a dual sentiment of self-consolation and passive resistance.
    For socialist society, the knowledge in the minds of exploiting-class intellectuals is not only unnecessary to be taken away, but can also be used to serve the people. However, for those who consider themselves experts, in the era of the Great Leap Forward, if they do not change their position and advance together with the people, this knowledge they boast as experts is easily left behind by the times and becomes obsolete and useless waste.
    Socialist experts must replace exploiting-class experts. All knowledge is obtained by the people in their struggles of production and class struggle. Exploiting-class intellectuals obtain this knowledge indirectly, but they despise the root from which this knowledge arises. Therefore, their self-proclaimed expertise should either be called a false expertise, or called an expertise that is applicable to exploiting-class societies but not to socialist societies. Such an expert cannot only not lead others, but it is also impossible to contribute to socialism unless they willingly accept the leadership of "laymen."
  　Marxist-Leninists believe that the struggle practice of the masses is the source of all knowledge, so they must put the political task of closely linking with the masses and drawing experience from the struggle practice of the masses in the first place. They believe that without politics as the soul and commander, any professional expertise will become a dead thing and lose its active role. Marxist-Leninists never belittle the expertise of experts, only oppose their exploiting-class ideas of despising the masses, and want them to liberate themselves from this reactionary thought and combine with the struggle practice of the masses to give full play to their active role. Under the illumination of the Party's general line, many experts have put down the airs of experts and willingly become students of the people, creating miracles together with the people that they could not have imagined in the past. Doesn't this vivid example most eloquently prove the correctness of Marxist-Leninist theory?
    Those who understand that politics is the soul and the commander, and who are good at combining politics with business, using the abstract to drive the practical, are the true experts in socialist construction. In the development of socialist society, such experts will become more and more numerous and will inevitably replace the experts of the exploiting classes.

### 谈外行领导内行

    谈外行领导内行
    蠖生
    外行不能领导内行的谬论，一年来虽然已受到许多驳斥，但仍有未尽之意，值得再来谈它一谈。人类社会实践证明，外行领导内行是一般规律，可以说只有外行才能领导内行，而内行是不能领导内行的。
    绝对意义上的由内行领导内行在现实生活中是不存在的。所谓行，当然指的是各种专科专业，而所谓内行，自然也指的是精通专门业务的人。但是，一切的行都不是一成不变，而是随着社会的发展在发展的。每一个行都在发展中越分越细，因而行也就越来越专了。例如说，演剧是艺术界的一个专行，但如果细分起来，在这一行之中又会存在更多的专行。不但话剧和歌剧不同，京剧和地方戏相异，就是在一个剧种之内，生旦净末丑各种演员也可以自成专行的。任何一种专业的内行，对其专业以外的各行来说都是外行，被称做“隔行如隔山”。这种专业化情形，愈是在现代化的科技范围内也愈加显著。所有专得深的人，大都是专得很窄的人。比如梅兰芳是京剧艺术大师，但他只擅长演旦角。旦角分为青衣、花旦、武旦、老旦、丑旦五行，他又只精于青衣。他唱老旦不如李多奎，更不用说生、净、末、丑其他各行了。
    专业分工愈是细密，在企业、事业以及科技、文艺任何一个机构内部，包含的不可缺少的专业也愈多。如同一个剧团必须包括生旦净末丑各种角色在内才能进行演出一样。在这样情况下，绝对意义上的内行领导内行是不可能的，因为一个人一般的只能精通一两行专业，对其他专业来说只能是外行。任何一个领导者只能精通自己所领导的行业中的一个或几个专业，很难对所有专业都是内行。
    人们也许会争辩说，把内行仅限于精通专业范围是太狭了，范围应当放宽些。例如让一个能够演出的演员来领导剧团，尽管他不是样样精通的内行，但比之不会演出的人总是稍胜一筹罢。不管把内行的范围怎样规定，事实恰恰是，凡是以内行自居的人，一定不能领导好这一行的工作。如果真能领导得好，他一定是丢掉内行架子，以外行身分来进行领导的。
    一切突出地标榜内行身分的人，在他们的思想深处都埋藏着丢掉政治领导的单纯技术观点。事实上，离开政治作灵魂、作统帅的技术，一定会变成凝固不化的东西，没有力量来解决实际斗争中任何一种矛盾。几年来社会实践充分证明了这个真理：教育专家无力解决单轨一贯制和普及教育之间的矛盾，艺术专家无力解决文艺活动中提高和普及之间的矛盾，科技专家不能解决高深研究和发扬群众的发明创造性之间的矛盾，经济专家也不能解决社会主义建设高速度发展中产生不平衡的矛盾。而这些矛盾的能否正确解决，都是关系到国家命运的大问题。一切专家们在这样大问题面前，不是束手无策就是向后退缩了。正是某些人称之为外行的我们的党，紧紧地依靠人民群众的智慧和力量，正确地解决了这些矛盾，使人民群众的创造力得到无限的发挥，从而使一切专业都在本行专家们不敢想像的程度上得到飞跃的发展。这不是充分说明了自称内行的人，只有在被他们称做外行人的领导下才能前进么！
    外行不能领导内行的实质是剥削阶级知识分子对无产阶级领导的抗拒。在剥削阶级的统治下，无产阶级被夺去了获得知识成为内行的权利。使自己成为内行，是剥削阶级及其知识分子独占的特权。革命推翻了剥削阶级的特权，使“粗陋无文”的无产阶级变成为统治阶级，这对于剥削阶级知识分子来说，是一件既不肯甘心接受又无力反抗的事情。他们觉得，唯一可以自慰的，就是装在他们头脑中的知识是别人剥夺不了的东西。于是“外行不能领导内行”的口号就带着聊以自慰和消极抵抗的双重情绪被提出来了。
    对于社会主义社会来说，剥削阶级知识分子头脑中的知识，不仅是无须剥夺的，而且是可以使之为人民服务的。但是对于自居内行的人们来说，在全民大跃进的时代中，他们如果不改变立场和人民群众一起前进，这些自夸为内行的知识是很容易落到时代后头去，变成陈旧无用的废物的。
    必须由社会主义的内行来代替剥削阶级的内行。一切知识都是人民群众在生产斗争和阶级斗争中得到的。剥削阶级知识分子用间接方法获得这些知识，却轻视产生这些知识的根源，因而他们自封的内行，应该或者称之为是一种假的内行，或者称之为是适用于剥削阶级社会而不适用于社会主义社会的内行。这样一种的内行，不仅不能领导别人，而且如果不心甘情愿地接受“外行”的领导，是不可能对社会主义有所贡献的。
  　马克思列宁主义者认为人民群众的斗争实践是产生一切知识的根源，所以必然把密切联系群众，从群众斗争实践中吸取经验的政治任务放在第一位。认定没有政治作灵魂、作统帅，任何专业特长都会变成死东西而失去积极作用的。马克思列宁主义者从来不轻视内行们的专长，仅仅反对他们轻视人民群众的剥削阶级思想，要他们从这种反动思想中解放出来，和人民群众的斗争实践相结合，以发挥其积极作用。在党的总路线照耀下，不少专家们放下了内行的架子，甘当人民群众的学生，和人民群众一起创造出他们过去不敢想像的奇迹来。这种活生生的事例，不是最雄辩地证明了马克思列宁主义理论的正确么？
    懂得政治是灵魂，是统帅，善于使政治和业务相结合，以务虚来带动务实的人，才是社会主义建设的真正内行。在社会主义社会发展中，这样的内行会越来越多，必然会代替剥削阶级的内行的。
