    The All-Purpose Work Team
    By our reporter, Fan Yinhuai
    On the construction site of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, there is such a team of workers: they can plaster on the ground, bind steel bars, and pour concrete; at high altitudes, they can build scaffolding, lift, and hoist. Every job is done neatly and efficiently. Those who don't know the situation, who would have thought that they were originally just a painting team?
    Two years ago, the Feng Tianxi painting team was transferred from the civil construction team to industrial construction. At that time, in addition to pasting ceilings, painting doors and windows, and painting walls, they could not even install glass. Now, they have learned fifteen types of work in civil engineering construction such as glass, linoleum, terrazzo, plastering, concrete work, lifting, hoisting, and riveting. They can do almost everything in civil engineering construction. During this period, they created and improved thirty-eight kinds of tools, and the more than three hundred new jobs they accepted were generally done wonderfully. Therefore, the workers on the entire construction site praised them as the "all-purpose work team."
    The team members of the Feng Tianxi painting team deeply felt the difficulties that over-detailed and rigid division of labor brought to organizing balanced construction. Every time a high-rise building or a large factory building was built, the painting team could only do painting work after the foundation was dug, the walls were built, and the roof was laid. While workers of other types of work were so busy, they could not help even if they were free. Only two or three months of the year were busy. Most of the team members felt very sad about being idle for a long time and taking state wages for nothing. At the same time, veteran workers felt that their skills were not being used effectively, and new workers felt that their skills were improving too slowly.
    What should we do? At that time, the construction site was short of workers installing concrete pipes, and Feng Tianxi gladly undertook this task. However, the team members had a lot of doubts. Old painters believed that "every trade is like a mountain." After being painters for many years, they had to become apprentices again if they did other work, which made them feel ashamed. Some complained: "Doing everything will make us a junk team." However, the Communist Party member Feng Tianxi believed that whatever the country needs, it should be done. He guided the team members to discuss at the team's meeting: "What should we do if the engineering schedule doesn't include painting team?" "Is it right not to want to do work that is not related to our profession?". These novel topics aroused a heated debate among the team members. In the end, the team members unanimously believed that the characteristic of the construction industry is assembly line operation, and it is impossible for all types of work to be done completely at the same time; only when workers learn more skills and do whatever is needed can fewer workers be used and idle work and shutdowns be avoided. At the same time, having more skills now is good for the country and ourselves, and it is definitely not like in the old society where "more skills don't guarantee a living." The next day, Feng Tianxi led the team members to the installation site and chose the heavy work to do himself first. Feng Tianxi was one of the most skilled in the team, and when others saw that he could still be an apprentice again, everyone followed suit.
    It was indeed difficult for workers who were used to painting and painting to learn the skills of other types of work, and not to hinder the progress and quality of the project. When they started learning manual drilling, the team members could not even distinguish the soil color. They sent team members to the professional drilling team to help others with their work and take the opportunity to learn from others. Soon, all the members of the team were able to determine the degree of tamping the foundation according to the different colors of the soil and the quality of the soil. Some techniques were not easy to learn by sending people out for short-term study, so they signed apprenticeship contracts with workers of other types of work or specially hired masters to teach them.
    Mastering multiple skills has also enriched the knowledge of our profession. In the past, workers used to paint walls by hand. This year, when they were doing this work, they thought of the principle of compressed air in air pipes and bellows, trial-produced a spraying machine, and modified the light bulb holder as a nozzle. This spraying machine is less laborious than manual operation, and the efficiency is increased dozens of times, and it is much lighter than complete mechanical painting.
    In the process of learning multiple technologies, the Feng Tianxi work team has always followed the needs of the construction progress, first learning the relatively easy types of work that are similar to their own profession, and then learning the more complex ones. Now, this team has become a model for carrying out multiple technical learning movements on the entire construction site. After creating new tools and improving efficiency, they ask the leaders to increase the quota. Therefore, they have been repeatedly rated as advanced work units in Taiyuan City.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 9th.

Mutual cooperation and great leap forward. Speed up the construction of sea ships. The Jiangnan and Dalian Shipyards launched a friendly competition.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 9th: A friendly competition of mutual cooperation and mutual promotion, striving to make the speed of shipbuilding catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level, has been launched between my country's two major brother shipyards - Jiangnan Shipyard and Dalian Shipyard. On the 7th, all the workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard issued a challenge to the Dalian Shipyard, responding to the Dalian Shipyard's challenge of launching a socialist competition in the manufacture of 5,000-ton seagoing vessels, and decided to build seagoing vessels ahead of schedule.
    Both Jiangnan Shipyard and Dalian Shipyard are responsible for manufacturing my country's first batch of 5,000-ton seagoing vessels this year. A 5,000-ton seagoing vessel of Dalian Shipyard - "Peace No. 25", was launched as early as May 6. A 5,000-ton seagoing vessel of Jiangnan Shipyard - "Peace No. 28", was also launched on June 19, the building cycle of the slipway was 35 days faster than that of Dalian Shipyard, creating a record of completing the hull construction of a 5,000-ton seagoing vessel in 70 working days. The workers of Dalian Shipyard expressed their warm congratulations to the workers of Jiangnan Shipyard for their achievements in accelerating the speed of shipbuilding. They proposed to Jiangnan Shipyard: resolutely advance the completion date of Peace No. 25 from the end of September to August 15; and also decided that when this seagoing vessel is on sea trial, it will be fully loaded with 5,000 tons of cargo and sail from Dalian Port to the Huangpu River to meet the brothers of Jiangnan Shipyard, and welcome Jiangnan Shipyard's Peace No. 28 to also test sail to Dalian after its completion. They also proposed to vigorously support Jiangnan, and they also hoped that Jiangnan and other shipyards in Shanghai would give them support.
    In the challenge letter, the workers of Jiangnan Shipyard stated that they would fully support the leap forward of Dalian Shipyard in the spirit of communism. They decided to immediately complete all the cooperative parts such as winch machines, main condensate pumps, and auxiliary condensate pumps, which were originally scheduled to be completed and delivered in August and September, and ensure that they would be completed and transported to Dalian before July 20 for installation by Dalian Shipyard; and let the oil hydraulic steering gear on the river ship currently under construction be used by Dalian Shipyard first to fully support the realization of Dalian Shipyard's leap forward plan to deliver the ship on August 15; the Peace No. 28, which was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of September, will also strive to be completed ahead of schedule, sail out of Wusongkou as soon as possible, and ride the wind and waves to Dalian.

    万能工作队
    本报记者  范银怀
    在太原重型机器厂建筑工地上，有那么一队工人：他们在地面能抹灰，绑扎钢筋、浇灌混凝土；在高空能搭架，起重，吊装。每项活都作得干净利落。不了解情况的人，谁能想到他们原来仅仅是个油工队呢。
    两年前，冯天喜油工队从民用建筑队伍调到工业建筑方面来。当时，他们除了表糊顶棚、油漆门窗、粉刷墙壁以外，连安装玻璃都干不了。现在，他们学会了玻璃、油毡、水磨工、抹灰、打混凝土、起重、吊装、铆焊等十五个工种的二十五种活。土木建筑中各项活计几乎样样能干。这个期间，他们创造和改进了三十八种工具，他们接受的三百多项新工作，一般都干得满精彩。因此，全工地的职工都赞誉他们是“万能工作队”。
    分工过细、过死，给组织均衡施工带来的困难，冯天喜油工队的队员们感受十分深刻。每建一座高楼、一座大厂房，总是挖了地基，砌起墙，铺完房顶，最后才轮到他们油漆粉刷。别的工种的工人忙得不可开交，他们闲着也插不上手。一年当中，只有两三个月有活干。大部分队员都对长期窝工，白拿国家工资感觉很难过。同时，老工人有技术使不在刀刃上，新工人又感觉技术提高得太慢。
    怎么办呢？当时工地上正缺少安装混凝土管道的工人，冯天喜欣然承当了这个任务。可是，队员们又产生了不少疑虑。老油工认为“隔行如隔山”，当了多年油工，现在干别的活还要重新当学徒，脸上不好看。有的埋怨说：“什么活都干，会成了破烂队。”共产党员冯天喜却认为，国家需要干啥就应当干啥。他引导队员们在队的生活会上讨论：“按工程进度轮不到油工队，该怎么办？”“不愿干非本工种的活对不对？”。这些新颖的题目引起了队员们一场热烈的争辩。最后，队员们，一致认为：建筑业的特点就是流水作业，各工种不可能完全同时工作；只有工人学的手艺多了，作到需要啥干啥才能少用工人，避免窝工、停工现象。同时，现在掌握的手艺多了，对国家对自己都有好处，绝不像旧社会那样“艺多不养人”。第二天冯天喜领着队员们到了安装工地，并且拣了繁重的活自己先干。冯天喜是队里手艺较高的，别人看到他还能重新当徒弟，大家便都跟着干起来了。
    作惯了油漆、粉刷这类活的工人，学习别工种技术，又要不妨害工程进度和工程质量，这确实有些困难。开始学习人工钻探时，队员们连土色就辨别不清，他们就派队员到专业钻探队去，一方面帮助别人干活，一方面利用一切机会向别人领教。不久，他们全队人员都能根据土壤不同的色泽、按土质好坏，确定捣固地基的程度。有些技术靠派人出去短期学习不容易学到，他们就和别工种工人订师徒合同或者专门请师傅来教。
    掌握多种技术，也丰富了本专业的知识。过去工人们都是用手工粉刷墙壁，今年他们作这种活的时候连想到气管、风箱的压缩空气的道理，试制成喷浆机，并且改装了电灯口当喷头。这种喷浆机比手工操作省劲，效率提高数十倍，比完全机械粉刷还轻便得多。
    冯天喜工作队在学习多种技术的过程中，一直沿着施工进度的需要，先学同本专业相近的比较容易的工种，而后学习较复杂的。现在，这个队已经成为全工地开展多种技术学习运动的典范。他们还在每次创造了新工具，提高了效率以后，就要求领导方面提高定额。因此，他们多次被评为太原市先进工作单位。互相协作大跃进  加快速度造海轮江南大连两船厂开展友谊竞赛
    据新华社上海9日电  一场相互协作、相互促进、力争造船速度赶上和超过世界先进水平的友谊竞赛，在我国两大兄弟船厂——江南造船厂和大连造船厂之间展开了。7日，江南厂全体职工向大连厂提出了应战书，响应大连厂关于在制造五千吨海轮中展开社会主义竞赛的挑战，决定提前把海轮造成。
    江南造船厂和大连造船厂今年都担负着制造我国第一批五千吨海轮的任务。大连厂的一艘五千吨海轮——和平二十五号，早在5月6日下水。江南厂的一艘五千吨海轮——和平二十八号，也在6月19日下水，船台建造周期比大连厂快三十五天，创造了七十个工作日完成一艘五千吨海轮船体建造的纪录。大连厂的职工对江南厂职工在加快造船速度方面取得的成就，表示了热烈的祝贺。他们向江南厂提出：坚决把和平二十五号的完工日期，从9月底提前到8月15日；还决定在这艘海轮试航时，要满载五千吨货物，从大连港开到黄浦江，去会见江南厂的弟兄，并欢迎江南厂的和平二十八号完工后也试航到大连来。他们还提出要大力支援江南，他们也希望江南和上海的其他造船厂给他们以支援。
    江南造船厂的职工在应战书中表示，要以共产主义精神全力支持大连厂的跃进。他们决定立即把原订在8、9月份完工交货的绞盘机、主凝泵、副凝泵等全部协作件，保证在7月20日前完工运往大连，供大连厂安装；并把正在建造中的川江轮上的油压舵机先让给大连厂应用，以全力支持大连厂8月15日交船跃进计划的实现；原定9月底完工的和平二十八号，也力争提前完工，早日开出吴淞口，乘风破浪驰往大连。
