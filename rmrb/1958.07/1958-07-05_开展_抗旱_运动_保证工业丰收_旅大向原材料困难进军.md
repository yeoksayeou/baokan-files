    Launch an "Anti-Drought" Campaign to Guarantee an Industrial Bumper Harvest
    Lüda Marches Towards Overcoming Raw Material Difficulties
    (By our correspondent) To overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials through self-reliance, Lüda City has launched a large-scale "anti-drought" campaign on the industrial front. In recent days, workers in factories throughout the city have been stepping up efforts to revise designs, improve technological processes, and conserve metal materials. They are also excavating and salvaging scrap steel on the ground, underground, at the seaside, and in the ports. Many organizations, groups, troops, schools, and street residents are also collecting and selling scrap copper and iron to support this "anti-drought" campaign.
    Due to the leap-forward development of industrial production in Lüda City this year, the insufficient supply of raw materials has become the most prominent difficulty in the second half of industrial production. For example, the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory's actual output last year was 97 locomotives, which has increased to 220 this year, more than doubling the output, but steel is short by more than 15,000 tons. The Dalian Crane Factory's planned output this year has also increased by one times compared to last year. Due to insufficient steel, individual workshops have been forced to suspend work and wait for materials.
    The Lüda Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party seized on this issue and asked the factories to discuss solutions. After discussions, many factories believed that the national industry is now in the midst of a great leap forward, and steel is needed everywhere. If we merely reach out for assistance from above, it will be difficult to solve the problem. We must adopt a proactive attitude, rely on the masses, and be self-reliant to overcome the difficulties. On June 18, the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on all workers in the city to learn from the spirit of farmers fighting drought and launch a mass "anti-drought" campaign on the industrial front to ensure a bumper industrial harvest this year. More than 200,000 workers in the city immediately responded to this call, putting forward five methods: "digging, salvaging, searching, saving, and substituting" to march towards overcoming raw material difficulties. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, which has the most difficulty in steel supply, put forward 195 measures to rely on its own strength to make up for the 25,000 tons of steel it lacks this year, and to break through the production target of 220 locomotives per year. Dalian Steel Plant, Dalian Shipyard, Dalian Mining Machinery Factory, Dalian Valve Factory, and Dalian General Machinery Factory also put forward measures to excavate, recycle, and save more than 100,000 tons of scrap steel in the "anti-drought" campaign. Dalian Steel Plant also decided to use scrap steel to increase the production of more than 37,000 tons of steel ingots.
    It now appears that through this campaign, all factories in the city, except for a very small number of steel plates and steel pipes that need to be allocated by the state, can solve most of the raw material problems through self-reliance, and this year's leap-forward production plan can also be successfully completed.
    At the beginning of the "anti-drought" campaign, some people thought: Every year we save and handle waste materials, how can there be so much waste to find? But within a few days of the campaign, about 6,000 tons of scrap steel were excavated and collected. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory has two "steel mountains," which are the places where waste materials have been piled up for 40 to 50 years since the factory was built, and excavation began several years ago. This time, the workers spent a few days digging out more than 1,400 tons of steel plates, steel pipes, and scrap steel from these two "steel mountains." On June 22, tens of thousands of workers from the Dalian Shipyard fought for five hours on the beach and docks, digging up more than 1,500 tons of scrap steel from the sea and underground. Workers from the Jinzhou Textile Factory and the Dalian Textile Factory found hundreds of tons of scrap steel after cleaning up the factory.
    Since the 19th century, Lüshunkou has always been a seaport contested by imperialists. There are still more than a dozen sunken ships in the seabed near this port that have not been salvaged. The Beiyang Salvage Team and the Lüshun Salvage Team, in order to support the industrial "anti-drought" campaign in Lüda City, and together with the local garrison and fishermen, have come to salvage the sunken ships. There is also much to be gained by searching for broken copper and scrap iron in society. Organizations, groups, schools, and street residents throughout the city quickly collected more than 100 tons of scrap steel.
    Many factories have actively revised product designs, improved technological processes and operating methods, and used substitute materials, which have achieved remarkable results. In just a few days, the workers of the Dalian Crane Factory found more than 200 ways to reduce the weight of the crane itself from the aspects of design, technology, and operation, so that each crane can use 10% less steel. It is estimated that more than 4,000 tons of steel can be saved by the end of the year, thus solving the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. The Dalian Diesel Engine Factory has reduced the weight of the 20-horsepower diesel engine by modifying the design, so that the weight of each diesel engine has been reduced from 670 kg to 360 kg, greatly saving steel.

    开展“抗旱”运动  保证工业丰收
    旅大向原材料困难进军
    本报讯　为了用自力更生的办法战胜原材料不足的困难，旅大市展开了一个声势浩大的工业战线上的“抗旱”运动。最近几天，全市各工厂的职工都在加紧修改设计，改进工艺规程，节约金属材料；并且在地上地下海边港口，挖掘和打捞废钢铁。机关、团体、部队、学校和街道居民，也有许多人在收集和出售废铜烂铁，支援这个“抗旱”运动。
    旅大市今年由于工业生产飞跃发展，原材料供应不足已经成为下半年工业生产中最突出的困难。例如，大连机车车辆制造厂去年实际产量为九十七台机车，今年增加到二百二十台，产量增加了一倍多，钢材缺少一万五千多吨。大连起重机厂今年计划产量也比去年增加一倍，由于钢材不足，个别车间曾经停工待料。
    中共旅大市委抓住这个问题，要求各厂讨论解决办法。许多工厂讨论以后认为：现在全国工业都在大跃进，到处都需要钢材，如果仅仅伸手向上要，那是很难解决问题的。必须采取积极主动的态度：依靠群众，自力更生，来战胜困难。6月18日，中共旅大市委号召全市职工学习农民抗旱的精神，在工业战线上也来个群众性的“抗旱”运动，保证今年工业大丰收。全市二十多万职工立即响应这一号召，提出了“挖、捞、找、省、代”五种办法，向原材料困难进军。钢材供应最困难的大连机车车辆制造厂的职工提出了一百九十五项措施，依靠自己的力量来补足今年所缺少的二万五千吨钢铁，并且要突破年产二百二十台机车的生产指标。大连钢厂、大连造船厂、大连工矿车辆厂、大连阀门厂和大连通用机器厂也提出措施，要在“抗旱”运动中，挖掘、回收和节约废钢铁十万吨以上。大连钢厂还决定利用废钢铁增产三万七千多吨钢锭。
    现在看来，通过这个运动，全市各工厂除了极少数钢板和钢管需要国家调拨以外，绝大多数原材料都可以自力更生解决，今年的生产跃进计划也能胜利完成。
    “抗旱”运动刚开始的时候，有人以为：年年节约，都要搞废料，那有这么多废料可找？但是运动开展几天，就挖掘和收集了废钢铁六千吨左右。大连机车车辆厂有两座“钢铁山”，是建厂四、五十年来堆放废料的地方，几年前就开始挖掘。这次，职工们用几天工夫，就在这两座“钢铁山”上挖出钢板、钢管和废钢铁一千四百多吨。大连造船厂成万名职工在6月22日到海边上、码头上，奋战了五小时，从海里、地下挖出废钢铁一千五百多吨，金州纺织厂和大连纺织厂的职工在厂内清理了一下，也找到上百吨废钢铁。
    旅顺口从十九世纪以来，曾经一直是帝国主义者争夺的海港。在这港口附近海底沉没的船只，现在还有十几只没有打涝起来。北洋打涝队和旅顺打涝队为了支援旅大市工业“抗旱”运动，和当地驻军、渔民一道，都来打涝沉船。在社会上搜集破铜烂铁，也大有可为。全市机关、团体、学校和街道居民，很快就搜集出一百多吨废钢铁。
    许多工厂积极修改产品设计，改进工艺规程和操作方法，利用代用材料，已经有显著成效。大连起重机厂职工几天功夫就找出二百多种办法，从设计、工艺和操作等方面减轻起重机自身重量，使得每台起重机可以少用钢材10％以上，预计到年底可以节省四千多吨钢材，因而解决了原材料不足的困难。大连柴油机厂通过修改设计，减轻二十马力柴油机的重量，使得每台柴油机体重从六百七十公斤降低到三百六十公斤，大大节省了钢铁。
