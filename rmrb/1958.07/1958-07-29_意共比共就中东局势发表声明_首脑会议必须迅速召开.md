Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: According to TASS, Rome, July 27th: The leadership of the Italian Communist Party issued a statement on the Middle East situation, pointing out that the situation caused by the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and the threat to Iraq, remains very serious.

The statement said: Troops continue to land in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Libya, and large numbers of air and naval forces are gathering in the Mediterranean region and are accumulating large quantities of atomic weapons. All aggressive organs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe are also preparing for combat.

The leadership of the Communist Party condemned the Italian government for not yet recognizing the newly established Republic of Iraq and for continuing to "collude with the colonialists."

The statement continued: The invading forces have currently stopped at the border of Iraq. Therefore, it is now possible to peacefully resolve the crisis caused by the American provocation; we should first and foremost attribute this to the strength of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's utmost determination to defend the independence of all nations, free them from the shackles of imperialism, and maintain peace.

The statement said that the people and most countries and governments around the world believe that a summit conference as proposed by Comrade Khrushchev must be convened without delay, while those who are unwilling to give up their aggressive intentions are creating more and more new obstacles to arranging this conference. Only by widely mobilizing all peace forces can these obstacles be overcome.

The leadership of the Communist Party called on the Italian people to struggle more resolutely for the holding of a summit conference, to urge the invading forces to withdraw from Arab countries, to restore peace in the Mediterranean region, and to realize the aspirations of the Arabs for unity and independence.

The statement said that at this critical juncture, the Communists once again appeal to Italian Catholics, calling on them to join hands with those who oppose the new danger of war and the shameful colonialist policy.

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Brussels News: The "Red Flag" published on July 18th a statement from the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, condemning the armed aggression of the United States and Britain against the Middle East.

This statement pointed out that the aggression of US and British imperialism against the Middle East has once again pushed the world to the brink of war disaster.

The statement pointed out that the Atlantic Treaty links Belgium with the United States, Britain, and France, so when these countries carry out any military adventures, Belgium's security is in danger. At the same time, members of the current Belgian government risk making our country's diplomatic position even more unfavorable. Under the influence of capitalist monopoly groups, Belgian government ministers are planning disturbing plans in terms of armaments and military measures.

The statement pointed out that Belgian workers' organizations strongly condemn the belligerent policy directed by the United States. This American aggression should be condemned in the United Nations. For the fundamental interests of Belgium, Belgium must pursue a comprehensive policy of maintaining good relations with Arab countries that are striving for their independence.

The statement said, "The Communist and Socialist workers belonging to the Belgian General Labour Federation will firmly oppose any expression of support for the imperialist adventurous policies by the Belgian representative to the United Nations. They will demand that the Belgian government respect the peaceful aspirations of our people. They will strive to seek and suggest all possible forms of international cooperation between workers' organizations to oppose the international conspiracy of financial consortia."

    意共比共就中东局势发表声明
    首脑会议必须迅速召开
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社罗马27日讯：意大利共产党指导处就中东局势发表声明指出，美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦并威胁伊拉克所造成的局势仍然非常严重。
    声明说：军队继续在约旦、黎巴嫩、土耳其和利比亚登陆，大批空军和海军力量正在地中海地区集结并且在聚集大量原子武器。北大西洋集团欧洲所有侵略机关也在进行战斗准备。
    共产党指导处谴责意大利政府还没有承认新成立的伊拉克共和国，而且仍然“同殖民主义者勾勾搭搭”。
    声明接着说：侵略力量目前在伊拉克边境停了下来。因此，现在已有可能和平解决由美国挑衅所引起的危机；这一切我们首先应当归功于苏联的力量和苏联保卫各国人民的独立、摆脱帝国主义束缚和维护和平的最大决心。
    声明说，世界各国人民和大部分国家和政府认为，现在必须毫不迟延地召开赫鲁晓夫同志所建议的最高级会议，而那些不愿意放弃侵略意图的人却正给安排这个会议制造越来越多的新障碍。只有广泛动员所有和平力量才能克服这些障碍。
    共产党指导处号召意大利人民为争取举行最高级会议、促使侵略军从阿拉伯国家撤退、恢复地中海地区的和平和实现阿拉伯人统一和独立的愿望而更坚决斗争。
    声明说，在这一紧急关头，共产党人再次向意大利天主教徒呼吁，呼吁他们同那些反对新战争危险和可耻的殖民主义政策的人携手合作。
    据新华社28日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：“红旗报”7月18日刊载了比利时共产党中央委员会政治局的声明，谴责美英两国对中东的武装侵略。
    这篇声明指出，美英帝国主义对中东的侵略又一次把世界推到战争灾祸的边缘。
    声明指出，大西洋公约把比利时同美国、英国和法国联结在一起，因此当这些国家进行任何军事冒险时，比利时的安全就处于危险之中。同时，比利时现政府的成员，有使我国外交地位更加不利的危险。比利时政府的部长在资本家垄断集团的影响之下，正在军备和军事措施方面策划令人不安的计划。
    声明指出，比利时工人组织有力地谴责美国所指使执行的好战政策。美国的这种侵略应该在联合国内受到谴责。为了比利时的根本利益，比利时必须对争取自己的独立的阿拉伯各国奉行全面的保持良好关系的政策。
    声明说，“属于比利时全国总工会的共产党和社会党工人，将坚定不移地反对比利时驻联合国代表支持帝国主义者冒险政策的任何表示。他们将要求比利时政府尊重我国人民的和平愿望。他们将努力寻求和建议采取促使各工人组织实现国际合作的一切可能形式，来反对金融财团的国际阴谋。”
