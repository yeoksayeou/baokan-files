    A Shining Example

    Someone who has experienced the 25,000-Li Long March is now farming in the countryside. In the eyes of some, this seems like a "bad deal," because "even without merit, there's still hard work" to be considered!

    To think about the issue more broadly: What did we make the revolution for? Wasn't it to establish a happy society and enable the people to live happy lives? Now, we have already achieved revolutionary victory and are advancing along the road to prosperity and happiness, and that is the biggest "good deal."

    Comrade Yu Guanghua experienced the Long March and also deeply understood the significance of the revolution. Therefore, after retiring from the army, he was able to actively participate in the construction of the new countryside. The glorious deeds of Comrade Yu Guanghua are a vivid communist teaching material for those who haggle over whether something is a "good deal" or a "bad deal" for themselves.

    光辉的榜样
    一个经历了二万五千里长征的人，现在在农村中种田，这在有些人看来，似乎是“划不来”的。因为“没有功劳也有苦劳”呀！
    把问题想得宽一点：我们革命为了什么？还不是为了建立一个幸福的社会，使人民过幸福的生活吗！现在，我们已经取得革命的胜利，正在沿着繁荣幸福的道路向前迈进，这就是最大的“划得来”。
    余光华同志经历了长征，也深刻理解了革命的意义，所以他在退伍之后，能积极参加新农村的建设。余光华同志的光辉事迹，对于那些斤斤计较自己“划得来”“划不来”的人，是一部生动的共产主义的教材。
