Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 24th — Bonn Dispatch: The West German government's duplicitous tactics on the Middle East issue have finally been exposed under pressure from the United States.

    A West German government spokesman read a written statement at a press conference on the 23rd. This statement insisted that "no act of aggression has occurred" in the Middle East, and openly described the landing of US-British aggressor troops in Lebanon and Jordan as being for the purpose of "easing the Middle East situation." The spokesman also said: "The Federal Government fully agrees with all the steps taken by the United States and Britain to protect Western interests."

    This statement was issued after the US Ambassador to Bonn handed a memorandum from the US government to the West German government on the 23rd. West German Chancellor Adenauer also convened a cabinet meeting specifically for this purpose. However, it is remembered that at a press conference just last week, the same spokesman had complained about the US and Britain sending troops to the Middle East.

    Observers believe that, on the one hand, West Germany is clearly unwilling to openly offend the Arab countries for fear of losing its sales market in the Arab world. However, on the other hand, under pressure from the United States, West Germany has no choice but to give actual support to the US-British aggressors, which puts it in an awkward dilemma.

    What best illustrates the problem is the West German government's attitude towards the Republic of Iraq. The Iraqi Embassy in Bonn announced on the 21st that it supported and was loyal to the government of the Republic of Iraq. The Iraqi Ambassador to Bonn, Ali Haidar Suleiman, formally notified the West German Foreign Ministry on the 22nd that a new government had been established in Iraq. This presented the West German government with a dilemma: whether or not to recognize the Republic of Iraq. It is reported that the West German government had indicated that in order not to let Iraq "fall into the arms of the Soviet Union," it would "study" the issue of recognizing the republican government. However, after the United States warned the West German government in a memorandum on the 23rd "not to prematurely recognize the Republic of Iraq," the West German government spokesman immediately said at a press conference that recognizing the new Iraqi government was "unrealistic."

    It is reported that US Secretary of State Dulles will arrive in Bonn on the 26th to meet with Adenauer in order to obtain more support from the West German government.

### 西德政府露出帮凶原形  公开支持美英侵略中东

    西德政府露出帮凶原形
    公开支持美英侵略中东
    新华社柏林24日电　波恩消息：西德政府在中东问题上所玩弄的两面手法终于在美国的压力下暴露了原形。
    西德政府发言人23日在记者招待会上宣读了一项书面声明。这项声明硬说，在中东“并没有发生侵略行为”，并且公然把美英侵略军在黎巴嫩和约旦的登陆说成是为了“缓和中东局势”。发言人还说：“联邦政府完全同意美英两国为保卫西方利益所采取的一切步骤”。
    这份声明是在美国驻波恩大使23日把一份美国政府的备忘录交给西德政府以后发表的，西德总理阿登纳还特别为此召开了内阁会议。但是，人们记得，就在上星期的记者招待会上，同一位发言人还曾对美英两国出兵中东口出怨言。
    观察家们认为，西德一方面由于害怕失掉它在阿拉伯各国的销售市场，显然不愿公开地得罪阿拉伯各国，但是，另一方面，西德在美国的压力下又不得不给予美英侵略者以实际的支持，这样，就使它自己处于左右两难的尴尬地位。
    最能说明问题的是，西德政府对伊拉克共和国的态度。伊拉克驻波恩大使馆在21日宣布，它支持和效忠于伊拉克共和国政府。伊拉克驻波恩大使阿里·哈达·苏莱曼在22日正式地通知西德外交部，伊拉克已经成立了新政府。这样，就向西德政府提出了一个难题：要不要承认伊拉克共和国？据报道，西德政府曾表示，为了不让伊拉克“投入苏联的怀抱”，它将“研究”承认共和国政府的问题。但是，当美国在23日的备忘录中警告西德政府
  “不要过早地承认伊拉克共和国”以后，西德政府发言人立刻在记者招待会上说：承认伊拉克的新政府是“不现实的”。
    有消息说，美国国务卿杜勒斯为了得到西德政府更多的支持，将在26日到波恩同阿登纳会谈。
