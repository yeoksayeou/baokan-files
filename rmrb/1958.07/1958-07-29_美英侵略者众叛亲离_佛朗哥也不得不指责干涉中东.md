US and British Aggressors Are Isolated and Losing Support
Even Franco Has to Condemn Interference in the Middle East

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Spanish dictator Franco has surprisingly slapped the US and British aggressors in the face. According to reports from Madrid, Franco told Herrera, the president of the "Ultima Hora" newspaper, on the 27th regarding the Middle East issue: the US and British dispatch of troops to Jordan and Lebanon was "a reaction that went against the development of the situation." He demanded that the US and Britain make a general revision of their Middle East policy, taking into account the internal realities of these countries and conforming to the natural trends of the times, rather than going against these trends. He said that among the people of the Middle East, colonial exploitation is currently detested. This shows that the US and British armed aggression in the Middle East is so unpopular that even the fascist ruler of Spain, fostered by them, considers it wise to offer some criticism to his masters.
    Franco is trying to pose as a friend of the Arab people. This is extremely ridiculous. No one will forget that not long ago, in Ifni, this fascist ruler carried out a bloody massacre against the Moroccan people. Franco's waving of the anti-colonialism banner now cannot conceal his own ugly face as a colonialist. However, in any case, Franco's attitude shows the extent to which the US and British aggressors are currently isolated.

### 美英侵略者众叛亲离  佛朗哥也不得不指责干涉中东

    美英侵略者众叛亲离
    佛朗哥也不得不指责干涉中东
    本报讯　西班牙的独裁者佛朗哥居然也出手打了美英侵略者一个巴掌。据马德里消息，佛朗哥27日在就中东问题对“终极报”社长埃雷拉说：美英出兵约旦和黎巴嫩是“背着局势的发展作出反应”。他要求美英对于中东的政策作一次总的修改，在作修改的时候应考虑到这些国家内部的现实，符合时代的自然潮流，而不是违背这种潮流。他说，目前在中东人民中，殖民主义剥削是受到厌恶的。这表明，美英两国对中东的武装侵略是这样的不得人心，以致受它们豢养的西班牙的那个法西斯统治者也认为对他的主子提出一些批评是得策的。
    佛朗哥企图扮成是阿拉伯人民的朋友。这是十分滑稽的。谁都不会忘记就在不久以前，在伊夫尼，这个法西斯统治者曾经对摩洛哥人民进行了一场血腥的屠杀。佛朗哥现在打起反殖民主义的旗帜，并不能掩饰他自己的殖民主义者的丑恶面目。不过无论如何，佛朗哥的这种态度，说明目前美英侵略者的处境已经孤立到了什么程度。
