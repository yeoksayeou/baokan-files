    Wooden Flatbed Cart
    In the struggle to eliminate shoulder-carrying and manual labor on Shanghai construction sites, Zhang Wenxiang of the Fifth Construction Company used old wood to make a simple flatbed cart. (See picture below.) It is suitable for transporting soil, sand, stone, mortar, and other items, and can be used both indoors and outdoors.
    This wooden flatbed cart has a very simple structure. The bottom has two large wooden wheels, and each side has two small wooden wheels; the rails are made of readily available scaffolding boards from the construction site, and wooden turntables can be added at the corners. Generally, construction sites can use old materials to make them, costing very little, but they have a wide range of uses and are flexible to move. They can greatly reduce labor intensity and save 50% of the labor force used for transportation. (Attached picture)

    木制小平车
    在上海建筑工地消灭肩挑人抬现象的斗争中，第五建筑公司的张文祥利用旧木料制成了一种简易的小平车。（见下图）它适于运输土、砂、石、砂浆等物品，室内室外都可采用。
    这种木制小平车构造很简单，底部有二个大木轮，两侧各有两个小木轮；轨道即利用工地现成的脚手板，转弯处可加木转盘。一般工地都能利用旧料制作，花费很少，但使用面广，行动灵活，可以大大减轻劳动强度，并能节约50％的用于运输的劳动力。（附图片）
