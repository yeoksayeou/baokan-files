Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Amidst the overall Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, China's first experimental atomic reactor has officially begun operation. The cyclotron has also been completed and is being prepared for scientific research work. These two facilities represent the great and precious assistance given to China by the Soviet Union to promote the development of China's atomic energy science and technology. Their completion marks China's entry into the atomic age.

This atomic reactor is a heavy water type, with a thermal power of 7,000 to 10,000 kilowatts, and its design is among the most advanced in the world. The Chinese workers and scientific and technical personnel who participated in the construction of this atomic reactor, under the care and support of the Party and the people of the whole country, and with the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, after intense labor, at 4:00 PM on June 13, the reactor began to generate a chain reaction. Currently, the power is being gradually increased to conduct scientific research work.

This cyclotron can accelerate alpha particles, enabling their energy to reach 25 million electron volts. It entered the adjustment phase in early March, and now the particle beam has been extracted from the vacuum chamber.

Simultaneously with the atomic reactor and the cyclotron, a high-pressure electrostatic accelerator manufactured by Chinese scientific and technical personnel themselves has also been completed. This accelerator can accelerate protons, enabling their energy to reach 2.5 million electron volts. Using this accelerator, scientific workers are conducting scientific experiments.

These facilities are all located in the Institute of Atomic Energy (formerly the Institute of Physics) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. All staff members of the institute are joyfully using the completion of these facilities and other scientific and technological achievements as a gift to the great Party on its 37th anniversary.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th - A brief explanation about atomic reactors.

A reactor is a device that sustains a chain reaction of nuclear fission. When a neutron strikes the nucleus of a uranium atom, it splits into the nuclei of two other elements, releasing a large amount of energy and two to three new neutrons. The neutrons released during fission are fast neutrons with high energy, but uranium nuclei are more likely to be split by slow neutrons. Therefore, a moderator is needed to reduce the energy of the fast neutrons. The neutrons with reduced energy (slow neutrons) then split other uranium nuclei, forming a chain reaction.

Reactors are the main form of utilizing nuclear energy currently. The heat energy released by reactors can be used to generate electricity. Reactors can be used as power plants for ships, trains, and airplanes. Reactors can be used to produce isotopes and conduct scientific research.

The main purposes of China's newly built experimental heavy water reactor are to conduct scientific research and produce isotopes. It uses uranium as fuel and heavy water as both the moderator and the heat transfer agent, so it is called an experimental heavy water reactor.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th - A brief explanation about cyclotrons.

In order to study the complex structure inside atomic nuclei, it is necessary to use particles with very high energy to break them apart. Accelerators are devices that artificially generate high-energy particles and use them to break apart atomic nuclei. Accelerators are the most important tools for studying the internal structure of atomic nuclei.

A cyclotron is a type of accelerator. Its electric field can accelerate charged particles, and under the action of a magnetic field, the charged particles move in a spiral path, causing them to be accelerated multiple times to reach the required energy. Finally, these high-energy particles are directed onto a target to bombard various atomic nuclei, conducting scientific research on the internal structure of atomic nuclei. Therefore, its completion will play a significant role in the development of basic theoretical research on atomic nuclei in China.

    在伟大苏联的援助下
    我国第一座原子反应堆建成
    回旋加速器也已建成正准备进行研究工作
    新华社30日讯　在社会主义建设全面大跃进中，我国第一座实验性原子反应堆已经正式运转。回旋加速器已经建成，正在准备进行科学研究工作。这两项设备是苏联为了促进我国原子能科学技术的发展所给予我国的伟大的珍贵的援助。它们的建成标志着我国已经开始跨进了原子能时代。
    这座原子反应堆是重水型的，它的热功率是七千到一万瓩，设计是世界最先进的。参加建设这个原子反应堆的我国工人和科学技术人员，在党和全国人民的关怀和支援下，在苏联专家的热情指导下，经过紧张的劳动，已于6月13日下午四时，反应堆开始发生链式反应。现在正在逐步提高功率，进行科学研究工作。
    这个回旋加速器，可以把?（阿尔法）粒子加速，使它的能量达到二千五百万电子伏特。3月初进入调整阶段，现在粒子束已经引出真空室。
    与原子反应堆和回旋加速器同时建成的，还有我国科学技术人员自己制造的高气压静电加速器，这个加速器能把质子加速，使它的能量达到二百五十万电子伏特。利用这个加速器，科学工作者正在进行科学实验。
    这些设备都设在中国科学院原子能研究所（前物理研究所）里。全所工作人员正以欢欣鼓舞的心情把这些设备的建成和其他科学技术的成果作为向伟大的党的三十七周年的献礼。
    新华社30日讯　关于原子反应堆的简要说明。
    反应堆是使原子核分裂维持链式反应的一种装置。当中子打入铀的原子核时，它就分裂成为两个其他元素的原子核，同时放出大量能量和两个到三个新的中子。分裂时放出的中子是快中子，能量很高，而铀原子核被慢中子分裂的可能性大，所以需要用慢化剂，使快中子的能量减低，能量减低了的中子（慢中子）又去分裂铀的原子核，这样就形成了链式反应。
    反应堆是目前利用原子核内部能量的主要形式。反应堆放出的热能可以利用来发电。反应堆可以作为轮船，火车，飞机的动力装置。利用反应堆可以制造同位素和进行科学研究。
    我国新建成的实验性重水型反应堆的主要用途是进行科学研究和制造同位素。它是用铀作燃料，用重水作慢化剂和导热剂，所以叫做实验性重水型反应堆。
    新华社30日讯　关于回旋加速器的简要说明。
    为了研究原子核内部的复杂结构，就必须用能量很高的粒子击破原子核。加速器就是用人工方法产生高能量的粒子，并且用它来击破原子核的设备。加速器是研究原子核内部结构最重要的工具。
    回旋加速器是加速器的一种类型。它的电场可使带电粒子加速，并在磁场作用下作回旋运动，使带电粒子多次加速，以达到所需要的能量。最后把这些高能量粒子引到靶上，用以轰击各种原子核，进行原子核内部结构的科学研究。因此它的建成将对我国发展原子核基本理论的研究起重大的作用。
