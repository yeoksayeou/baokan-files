Chinese Muslims Support Arab Brothers
Speech by Dapusheng, Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Association

We Chinese Muslims, together with the people of the whole country, warmly congratulate the great victory of the Iraqi people. The great victory of the Iraqi people is a new victory for the people of Asia and Africa, especially the Arab people, in opposing imperialism and defending national independence and freedom. The victory of the Iraqi people shattered the notorious Eisenhower Doctrine, disintegrated the Baghdad Pact of American aggression in the Middle East, directly supported the struggle of the Lebanese people, and fundamentally changed the situation in the Middle East. We firmly support the Republic of Iraq. We firmly support the just struggle of the Arab people against imperialism and for the defense of national independence and freedom.

On July 15, American imperialism, in desperation, disregarded world opinion and brazenly dispatched armed forces to land in Lebanon, carrying out armed intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs. It also attempted to invade Jordan and threaten the Republic of Iraq. This act of aggression by American imperialism is not only a blatant provocation against the people of Arab countries, but also seriously threatens peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. The behavior of American imperialism is completely devilish. It is the enemy of Muslims all over the world and the enemy of all peace-loving people in the world.

"Love of the motherland is part of the Islamic faith." Allah revealed in the Koran: "Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you." Opposing the aggression of American imperialism and driving the American troops out of our country's territory is fighting for the way of Allah, which is a just struggle. The just struggle to drive away the American aggressors will surely be assisted by Allah, will surely be supported by the people of the world, and will surely be victorious. American imperialism is doomed to failure.

We Chinese Muslims, together with the people of the whole country, firmly support our government's statement against American armed intervention in Lebanon. We fully support the just struggle of the Arab people. The United States must not interfere in the internal affairs of the Arab people. The American troops must get out of Lebanon quickly!

Down with the devilish American imperialism!
Long live world peace!

    中国穆斯林支持阿拉伯弟兄
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生的讲话
    我们中国穆斯林和全国人民一同，热烈祝贺伊拉克人民的伟大胜利。伊拉克人民的伟大胜利，是亚非人民、特别是阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义、保卫民族独立和自由的又一个新的胜利。伊拉克人民的胜利，打烂了臭名昭彰的艾森豪威尔主义，瓦解了美国侵略中东的巴格达条约，直接支援了黎巴嫩人民的斗争，根本改变了中东的形势。我们坚决支持伊拉克共和国。坚决支持阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义、保卫民族独立和自由的正义斗争。
    7月15日，美帝国主义竟然狗急跳墙，冒天下之大不韪，公然派遣武装部队在黎巴嫩登陆，对黎巴嫩内政进行武装干涉。并且企图侵入约旦，威胁伊拉克共和国。美帝国主义这种侵略行动，不仅是对阿拉伯各国人民的狂妄挑衅，而且严重威胁亚非和世界的和平。美帝国主义的行为，完全是魔鬼的行为。是全世界穆斯林的仇敌，是全世界一切爱好和平的人民的仇敌。
    “爱护祖国是伊斯兰教信仰的一部分”。真主曾在古兰经中启示说：“你们当为主道而抵抗进攻你们的人。”反对美帝国主义的侵略，把美国军队从本国领土赶出去，就是为主道而战，就是正义的斗争。赶走美国侵略者的正义斗争，一定会得到安拉的襄助，一定会得到全世界人民的支持，一定胜利。美帝国主义注定要失败。
    我们中国穆斯林和全国人民一同，坚决拥护我国政府关于反对美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的声明。全力支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。不许美国干涉阿拉伯人民内政。美国军队必须从黎巴嫩快快滚出去。
    打倒魔鬼美帝国主义！
    世界和平万岁！
