Living Younger and Younger
    ——A Visit to Biriya, a 121-Year-Old Soviet Man

    "Grandpa, do you still remember the past?"
    Old Man Biriya grinned, revealing two rows of neat white teeth. He narrowed his eyes and slowly said, "A hundred years ago, I fell in love with a girl named Sophia. She was extremely beautiful. Later, alas, she was snatched away by a count!..."
    His memory is truly amazing, and his body seems very strong. Among the 300,000 residents of the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic, there are more than 2,000 such elderly people.
    Under the free Soviet sky, from the cold north to the hot south, centenarians are everywhere. Look: Russia has 120,000 long-lived elderly people, Ukraine has 24,000, Belarus has 8,000, Georgia has more than 10,000...
    What is the "secret" to longevity?
    Old Man Biriya put it well: "If the Tsar were still here, I'm afraid I would have been gone long ago. Maybe that's a 'secret'!"
    The old man recalled the painful life of the Tsarist era. At that time, his health was not good. In 1919, Biriya, at the age of eighty-two, participated in the fight against landlords and nobles while ill. The Soviet regime made him "young again."
    Old Man Biriya also said: "My longevity may also have a 'secret', that is labor. Last year, I did one hundred and eighty workdays."
    Biriya is busy from dawn to dusk every day. Herding sheep up the mountain, hunting on horseback, guiding young people in cultivating flowers, fruits, and tea... His family and the farm chairman are worried about his health. Biriya's dozens of grandchildren, granddaughters, daughters-in-law, great-grandchildren, great-granddaughters, etc., have more than once taken turns to persuade the old man to "rest and enjoy his old age, and stop working so hard." The old man had no choice but to take a copy of the "Soviet Constitution" and go to the village soviet, saying: "Chairman, please guarantee my right to work!"
    The old man "won." However, he still agreed to go to his second son's house in the city for a few days of rest. Who knew that he fell ill soon after entering the city. Biriya couldn't be idle for a day; he always thought about his beloved farm. His son panicked and hurriedly sent his father back to the countryside. In labor, the old man gradually recovered again.
    For Biriya, labor is no longer a "means of making a living," but "the first need of life." Therefore, everyone calls him a "model communist elder."
    Biriya is also a singer! People can often hear the songs of the "Biriya Family Choir" from the white building.
    The year before last, an amateur "Old People's Choir" was established in the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic. The twenty-six members from fourteen villages are mostly over 100 years old, the youngest is seventy years old, and Biriya is the oldest. Last October, the choir's performance caused a sensation in the city of Tbilisi. In the opera house, in the cultural palace, in the clubs, in the crowded squares, the old people played the piano and blew the flute, sang loudly, told stories, recited poems, and danced the "Saladin" and other fast-paced folk dances. They sing the ancient people's heroes, and also sing today's happy life. Before each concert ends, Old Man Biriya always solemnly hands the "Abkhazian" piano to the Young Pioneers, and the children perform the final performance.
    Biriya said that the reason he is getting younger and younger is because life is getting more and more interesting. Before the revolution, he was illiterate, and he only learned to read and write at the age of one hundred. He is extremely interested in all new things. He said: "I want to take a jet plane and go to Beijing to see!"
    The old man talked with us for three hours without feeling tired at all. When we parted, he said loudly: "I wish Chairman Mao Zedong good health! I hope he lives even longer than me!" (Attached picture)

    越活越年轻
    ——访一百二十一岁的苏联老人比里雅
    东生
    “爷爷，从前的事还记得不？”
    比里雅老人咧嘴一笑，露出两排整齐的白牙。他眯起眼睛，慢慢说道：“一百年前，我爱上了一个姑娘，叫索菲娅。她长的美极了。后来，唉，被伯爵抢去啦！……”
    他的记忆力真是惊人，身体看来也非常结实。在阿布哈则自治共和国三十万居民间，这样的老人有两千多个。
    在苏维埃自由的天空下，从寒冷的北部到炎热的南方，处处出寿星。请看吧：俄罗斯有十二万长寿老人，乌克兰有两万四千，白俄罗斯有八千，格鲁吉亚有一万多……。
    长寿的“秘密”何在呢？
    比里雅老人说得好：“要是沙皇还在，我恐怕早就不在了。这也许算个‘秘密’吧！”
    老人回忆起沙皇时代的痛苦生活。那时，他的身体并不好。1919年，八十二岁的比里雅抱病参加了反对地主和贵族的战斗。苏维埃政权使他“返老还童”了。
    比里雅老人还说：“我的长寿，也许还有个‘秘密’，那就是劳动。去年，我做了一百八十个劳动日。”
    比里雅每天从黎明到黄昏总是忙碌不停。赶羊上山啦，骑马打猎啦，指导青年栽培花果、茶叶啦……。家里人和农庄主席都为他的健康耽心。比里雅的几十个孙子、孙女、孙媳妇、重孙、重孙女等等曾不止一次地轮流地劝老人“静心养老，别再操劳”。老人没办法，就拿了本“苏联宪法”，去到村苏维埃说：“主席呀，请你保障我的劳动权吧！”
    老人“胜利”了。不过，他还是答应到城里二儿子家中休养几天。谁知他进城不久，就病倒了。比里雅一天也不能游手好闲，他时时惦念着心爱的农庄。儿子着了慌，急忙把父亲送下乡。在劳动中，老人又渐渐复原了。
    劳动对于比里雅，已不再是“谋生的手段”，而是“生活的第一需要”了。所以，大家称他为“标准的共产主义老人”。
    比里雅还是个歌手呢！人们常常可以听到，从白色的楼房里传出的“比里雅家庭合唱团”的歌声。
    前年，在阿布哈则自治共和国，成立了一个业余的“老人合唱团”。来自十四个村庄的二十六个团员，多半是百岁以上的老人，最年轻的七十岁，比里雅是最年长的一个。去年十月，合唱团的表演轰动了第比利斯城。在歌舞剧院里，在文化宫、俱乐部里，在万人拥挤的广场上，老人们弹琴吹箫，引吭高歌，说故事，朗诵诗，跳“莎拉丁”等节奏急促的民间舞。他们歌唱古代的人民英雄，也歌唱今天的幸福生活。每次音乐会结束以前，比里雅老人总要把“阿勃海查”琴庄严地交给少先队员，由孩子们作最后一场表演。
    比里雅说，他所以越活越年轻，因为越活越有意思。革命前，他是个文盲，一百岁上才学会了读书写字。他对一切新鲜事儿都感到莫大的兴趣。他说：“我想坐喷气式飞机，去北京看看哩！”
    老人和我们谈了三小时而毫无倦意。临别的时候，他大声说：“祝毛泽东主席健康！希望他比我活得还长！”（附图片）
