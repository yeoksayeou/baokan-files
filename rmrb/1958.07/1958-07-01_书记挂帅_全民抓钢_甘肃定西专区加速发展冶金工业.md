Following the general line of going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results in building socialism, the Dingxi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Gansu Province has set a target of smelting 200,000 tons of steel, 200,000 tons of iron and 10,000 tons of copper this year, laying the foundation for the mechanization of agriculture in the entire prefecture within three years.

The smelting industry in this special district was originally a blank slate, but the people of the entire region have demonstrated amazing wisdom and strength, universally adopting indigenous methods to smelt steel and copper. The quality meets the standards.

Now, in the spirit of "ten-point targets, twelve-point measures, and twenty-four-point effort," various localities are taking measures to strengthen the leadership of the metallurgical industry. In each county, the secretary takes the lead, and the whole people are engaged in the iron and steel industry. Counties such as Huining, Lintao, and Dingxi have transferred a large number of district-level cadres, technical school and middle school leaders to serve as secretaries and factory directors of these factories and mines. Their slogan is "smelt whatever ore is found," "combining indigenous and modern methods, indigenous first, then modern." This year, more than 2,000 indigenous blast furnaces and indigenous converters will be built throughout the region. Lintao County plans to build 50 small indigenous steelmaking converters with a daily output of 10 tons and 500 indigenous blast furnaces with a daily output of 4 tons. Before the end of July, the first batch of 43 indigenous converters and indigenous blast furnaces will be put into production. The No. 1 "Surpass Britain" blast furnace has been completed. In terms of funds, resources, equipment and technology, they all rely on the masses to solve the problems. For example, the successful smelting of manganese steel in Lintao was the result of the cooperation of Cao Yonglin, the principal of Lintao Normal School, Xiang Shihuang, a teacher at Lintao Middle School, and veteran workers Wang Mengming, Zhang Chongshan and Zhang Jichong. At present, the Dingxi Special District has more than 24,000 factories run by the whole people, including more than 1,300 backbone factories. Unprecedentedly, new products such as general-purpose tractors, automobiles, locomotives, seeders and harvesters have been manufactured. With the development of the iron and steel smelting industry, the coal mining, coking, cement and refractory material industries will also develop correspondingly on a large scale. The machinery and agricultural machinery manufacturing industries will also grow rapidly.

    书记挂帅　全民抓钢
    甘肃定西专区加速发展冶金工业
    本报讯　记者翟其寅报道：遵循多快好省的建设路线，中共甘肃定西地委确定今年炼钢二十万吨，炼铁二十万吨和炼铜一万吨，为全专区三年内实现农业机械化奠定基础。
    这个专区的冶炼工业原是一个空白点，但是全区人民发挥了惊人的智慧和力量，普遍采用土办法，炼出了钢和铜。质量合乎标准。
    现在，各地本着“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”的精神，正在采取措施，加强冶金工业的领导。各县都是书记挂帅，全民抓钢铁工业，会宁、临洮和定西等县已抽调大批区级干部、技校和中学的领导人员担任这些厂矿的书记和厂长职务。他们的口号是“见矿就炼”“土机结合，先土后机”。今年全区将建成两千多个土高炉和土转炉。临洮县今年计划建成五十个日产十吨的小型炼钢土转炉，五百个日产四吨的炼铁土高炉。7月底以前，第一批四十三个土转炉和土高炉将投入生产。第一号“超英”高炉已经建成。在资金、资源、设备和技术等方面，均依靠群众解决。如临洮的锰钢冶炼成功，即是由临洮师范校长曹永霖，临洮中学教员向世璜等同老工人王梦明、张崇善、张技崇合作的结晶。现在，定西专区全民办厂达两万四千多个，其中骨干厂有一千三百多个。并且破天荒地制成万能拖拉机、汽车、火车头、播种机、收割机等新产品，随着钢铁冶炼工业的发展，采煤、炼焦、水泥和耐火材料等工业也将相应大量发展。机械、农械制造工业也将迅速增长。
