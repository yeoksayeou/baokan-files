This year, various regions have planned and universally expanded the sweet potato planting area. During the Great Leap Forward, thanks to the diligent efforts and careful cultivation of the broad masses of farmers, sweet potatoes are growing very well, and the yield will be unprecedentedly high and increased. After a bumper harvest of sweet potatoes, how to best preserve and utilize them has become a matter of great concern for farmers in major sweet potato producing areas.

The "settling accounts after the autumn harvest" faction, though feeling speechless in the face of increased production facts, is still painstakingly searching for air-raid shelters for their bankrupt arguments, saying that sweet potatoes have a lot of water, large volume, heavy weight, and thin skin, making them difficult to store, hard to transport, and prone to disease and rot, inevitably leading to a "bumper harvest turning into disaster." Don't be happy too soon; you'll still be on the losing end. Under the illumination of the Party's General Line, the broad masses of farmers, whose minds have been greatly liberated, can not only greatly increase sweet potato production but will also certainly have better ways to utilize sweet potatoes and make them better serve socialist construction. In fact, people have already found many uses for sweet potatoes, and the secrets of sweet potatoes are being revealed. The phenomenon of "bumper harvest turning into disaster," as said by the "settling accounts after the autumn harvest" faction, will never happen; for the broad masses of farmers and the entire country, it is a treasure trove of harvest. Look at the plan of the Daxinzhai Agricultural Cooperative in Pinggu County: they use sweet potatoes to extract starch, refine alcohol from the starch residue, and then use the distiller's grains to feed pigs. From head to toe, from skin to core, the entire sweet potato is utilized without any waste; and there is also the fact of the Chengdu Pharmaceutical Factory, which uses sweet potatoes to produce citric acid, a very important raw material for the chemical industry; and the Neijiang Prefecture of Sichuan Province uses sweet potatoes instead of rice to make maltose. Various methods of utilizing sweet potatoes have been created and are still being created in large numbers. "Every part of the sweet potato is useful, every part of the sweet potato is a treasure," this is the resounding reply of the broad masses of farmers to the "settling accounts after the autumn harvest" faction. Sweet potatoes are no longer just a major auxiliary food for people, nor just an important raw material for the food industry, but also a very important raw material for the development of industry (alcohol can be used to produce synthetic rubber, rayon, etc.), transportation, and medical and health undertakings. Now, the task of the leaders is, while leading the broad masses of farmers to strive for a bumper harvest of sweet potatoes, how to help and guide the masses to do a good job in the storage and processing preparations of sweet potatoes, which are "a treasure from head to toe." In this regard, the masses have many good experiences in preserving sweet potatoes and have created many good methods for utilizing sweet potatoes. The responsibility of leaders at all levels and relevant business departments is to discover these experiences, study the creations of the masses, and collect and vigorously promote all these successful experiences and creations. Don't think that there are still two or three months before the sweet potato harvest season. Digging a well only when one is thirsty cannot quench the thirst. If action is taken late and arrangements are made late, the situation of "bumper harvest turning into disaster" as described by the "settling accounts after the autumn harvest" faction will really occur. Therefore, doing a good job in the preservation and utilization of sweet potatoes is not just an economic issue but also a political issue. The broad masses of cadres and the masses must do this major task well.

    一项重要任务
    田连阡
    今年各地有计划地普遍扩大了甘薯种植面积。在大跃进中，由于广大农民的辛勤努力，精心栽培，甘薯生长十分良好，产量将空前提高和增加。甘薯大丰收后，怎样最好地保存和利用，就成为广大产薯地区农民一个很关心的问题了。
    秋后算账派在增产事实面前虽已感到理屈词穷，却仍在大费苦心地为自己破产了的论调找防空洞，说什么甘薯水多、体积大、份量重、皮薄，不易保管，很难运输，容易染病，霉烂，一定要“丰收成灾”。先不要高兴得太早吧，这回等着你们的还是输账。在党的总路线照耀下，思想大解放了的广大农民，既然能够使甘薯大量增产，也就一定更有办法利用甘薯，使它更好地为社会主义建设服务。事实上人们已经找出了甘薯的多种用途，甘薯的秘密正在揭开。事情绝不会发生像秋后算账派说的“丰收成灾”的现象，在广大农民和整个国家说来却是丰收获宝。请看，这里是平谷县大辛寨农业社的计划，他们用甘薯制取淀粉，粉渣提炼酒精，酒糟再拿去喂猪，从头到脚从皮到里，整个的甘薯统统被利用起来了，没有一点一星的糟踏；还有成都制药厂的事实，该厂用甘薯制成了很重要的化学工业原料柠檬酸；而四川内江专区又用甘薯代替大米制成了饴糖。各种各样利用甘薯的方法已被创造出来，并且还在大量的创造着。“甘薯通身都有用，甘薯通身都是宝”，这就是广大农民给秋后算账派的响亮回答。甘薯已经不仅仅是人们的一种主要辅助粮食，不仅仅是食品工业的一种重要原料，而且也是发展工业（酒精可生产合成橡胶、人造丝等）、交通运输、医药卫生事业一个很重要的原料了。现在，领导者的任务是，在领导广大农民争取甘薯大丰收的同时，如何帮助和指导群众把“通身都是宝”的甘薯贮藏和加工准备工作做好。在这方面，群众中蕴藏着很多保存甘薯的好经验，创造了许多利用甘薯的好办法，各级领导和有关的业务部门的责任是发现这些经验，研究群众的创造，把这些成功的经验和创造统统搜集起来，大力推广开去。不要以为距甘薯收获期还有两三个月时间，临渴掘井是不能解渴的，那里动手迟，安排晚，就真会出现秋后算账派所说的“丰收成灾”的局面。因此，作好甘薯的保存利用工作，不只是经济问题，也是政治问题。广大干部和群众一定要把这件大事作好。
