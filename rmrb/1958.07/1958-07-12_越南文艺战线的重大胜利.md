A Major Victory on Vietnam's Literary and Art Front
Vietnam, Nguyen Dinh Thi

For several months, the Vietnamese literary and art circles have waged a fierce struggle against the reactionary ideological tendencies and destructive activities of the "Humanities-Good Works" group. This group formed in 1956, and its members were a number of intellectuals and literary and art workers gathered around the "Humanities Newspaper" and "Good Works" magazine, published by a private publishing house in Hanoi.

The "Humanities-Good Works" group was essentially an anti-communist alliance in the cultural and literary fields. The leading figures of this alliance were seasoned "spiritual warfare" veterans (Thuy An), veteran Trotskyists (Truong Tuu), consistent counter-revolutionaries (Phan Khoi), and revolutionary opportunists and traitors (Nguyen Huu Dang) and others. They wooed some literary and art workers who had participated in the war of resistance, such as Le Dat, Tran Dan, Hoang Cam, Tu Pha, Si Ngoc, Van Cao, Phung Quan, and others. These people were pulled in after entering the city and were corrupted by bourgeois ideology to the point of degeneration. They went from being lost in line, ideology, and art to viciously and madly opposing the Party and the people's democratic system.

At the end of 1956, after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Vietnamese Labor Party discovered some errors in the land reform work and conducted self-criticism of certain shortcomings in the Party's work. At this time, in the countryside, some reactionary elements in religious guises and landlords colluded with some ruffians, former puppet soldiers, and puppet regime elements to carry out sabotage activities and conspire to create riots. In the cities, the bourgeoisie also launched attacks against the Party on the economic, political, and cultural fronts, attacking the Party and government's policies, demanding open free markets, free operation, etc., with the aim of opposing socialism. Thus, the "Humanities-Good Works" group thought their "opportunity had come." They colluded and mobilized, rallying and shouting. They received economic assistance from some bourgeois reactionary elements, who provided them with paper, printing plants, and all the conveniences for publishing and distribution. They published a series of newspapers and magazines, such as "Humanities," "Good Works," "New Land," "Creation," "Free Forum," etc. These reactionary publications, under the deceptive arguments of so-called "bravely discovering shortcomings" and "developing Marxism-Leninism," wantonly slandered, distorted, and attacked the people's democratic system, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The "Humanities" elements used all means, including corrupt and degenerate means, to develop their influence, sow discord between literary and art circles and the Party, and incite literary and art circles to oppose the Party's leadership. Some "Humanities" elements teaching in universities, such as Tran Duc Thao and Truong Tuu, tried their best to win over and provoke university students, attempting to create what they called a "Poznan event in Vietnamese schools." They also incited a part of the bad elements in the Democratic Party to plan to coordinate the attack during the sixth session of the National Assembly, attempting to demand a change in the policies and lines of the Labor Party and the government, and demanding to share power with the Labor Party. They spread public opinion, preparing to establish a new "party of the masses," because according to them, "the Vietnamese Labor Party has become corrupt and is no longer a party of the masses." After the Hungarian event broke out, the "Humanities" elements openly tore off their masks in front of the masses. The "Humanities Newspaper" published articles calling on the masses to take to the streets for "freedom" and to oppose the government. At this time, their ambition was fully exposed; they attempted to imitate the actions of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary elements.

However, the "Humanities" elements' conspiracy did not succeed, but shattered like a soap bubble. They constantly shouted that "the storm is coming." The storm has come, but it is not the counter-revolutionary gale they hoped for, but the people's storm, which blew fiercely and toppled the black flag of smoke and miasma that they tried so hard to raise. At the end of 1956 and the beginning of 1957, workers, soldiers, cadres, intellectuals, literary and art workers, youth, and students in Hanoi and major cities, under the leadership of the Party, rose up to counter the fraudulent and poisonous arguments spread by the "Humanities Newspaper." This reactionary newspaper was ordered to be shut down by the Hanoi Administrative Committee.

However, the "Humanities-Good Works" group was unwilling to repent and reform. They secretly conspired to lie dormant in order to carry out new sabotage plots. In 1957, Truong Tuu, Tran Duc Thao, and others further strengthened their base in schools, conducting propaganda of revisionism, opposing the Soviet Union and socialist countries, and opposing the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party. They clamored to turn the university into their "explosion base."

Thuy An, Nguyen Huu Dang, and others instructed some literary and art workers who had betrayed the revolution to sneak into various literary and art organizations and agencies, trying every means to manipulate the editorial departments of various publications and publishing agencies, so as to publish some works they called "expressing two sides" or "buried with landmines," that is, to continue attacking socialism and the Labor Party by adopting a two-faced approach. They served as rumor loudspeakers for imperialist radio stations such as the British "BBC," the "Voice of America," and Saigon Radio every day. They distributed reactionary books and newspapers supplied by "spiritual warfare" elements, especially those Trotskyist political and literary books and American "Free World" anti-communist books and newspapers. They further adopted means of buying, threatening, attacking, and wooing to sow discord between literary and art circles and the Party's leadership. On the other hand, seeing that the revolution was steadily advancing, they became discouraged and fell into a decadent life: alcoholism, drug addiction... They put forward such slogans: "Live like Lao and Zhuang, eat and drink like the bourgeoisie, and speak like the proletariat." They planned by the opium lamp to escape to South Vietnam or capitalist countries, because according to them, wherever is comfortable is their motherland.

While the "Humanities-Good Works" group was carrying out insidious activities, some responsible comrades in literary and art organs lost their vigilance or were influenced. The "Van" newspaper of the Vietnam Literature Association published some dangerous and erroneous articles, put forward some revisionist views, and violated the Party's literary and art line. The Literature Association's publishing house and club were also seriously manipulated by the "Humanities-Good Works" group for a period of time. They turned these organs into open forums for their reactionary propaganda, spreading revisionist views in politics and art.

However, the new conspiracy of the "Humanities-Good Works" group was once again crushed. At the beginning of 1958, the Labor Party organized 500 literary and art workers and thousands of cultural work cadres to study, study the two declarations of the Moscow Conference and the domestic situation, and discuss the letter from the Central Committee of the Labor Party to the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers (1957). After several months of study and research, literary and art workers resolutely struggled against revisionism on the literary and art front, exposing and defeating all kinds of revisionist hostile thoughts and actions. In the face of irrefutable facts, the core members of the "Humanities-Good Works" group had to bow their heads and confess their guilt. Some comrades who had lost their vigilance or were influenced by revisionism in the past also realized their mistakes. In schools, teachers and students also launched fierce struggles, exposing the masks of Truong Tuu, Tran Duc Thao, and others, revealing their reactionary conspiracies, and crushing the absurd arguments they had vigorously promoted and called "new Marxism" and "continuing Marx's cause."

The struggle is still continuing, and has so far achieved a major victory. In front of the broad masses of the people, the true face of the "Humanities-Good Works" group has been exposed. They have revealed their true colors as a group of very insidious poisonous snakes who are engaged in sabotage activities, enemies of the people, and enemies of communism and the Communist Party. Upright intellectuals and literary and art workers, as well as people from all walks of life, have demanded sanctions against those stubborn elements.

Through this struggle, the literary and art circles also gave a fatal blow to the reactionary political and artistic views of the "Humanities-Good Works" group. The Trotskyist and opportunist "theorists" of this group, such as Truong Tuu, Tran Duc Thao, Nguyen Huu Dang, etc., once claimed to be Marxists-Leninists, but they put forward such reactionary arguments as "the task of the proletarian dictatorship is to develop individual freedom," "it is impossible for Vietnam to enter socialism now," "Vietnam must break away from the socialist camp in order to achieve reunification," etc. In the economic field, the "Humanities" elements demanded that the bourgeoisie be given freedom of operation; in the political field, they advocated freedom in opposition to the people's democratic system; in the cultural and artistic fields, they distorted "let a hundred flowers bloom" as "fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds can be allowed to bloom with equal freedom." They clamored, "Return literature and art to writers and artists, return business to experts, and the Party cannot lead literature and art." They also used all kinds of means to slander communism, calling it "Stalinism," "without conscience," "uncivilized," "trampling on personality," "treating people as tools of production," etc. They called the communists "the bureaucrats of the new ruling class" and the communist parties of various countries "the Stalinist system." Most of these arguments were copied from the "free world." They reprinted the cliches of international Trotskyites and revisionists. They did not forget to use the "theories" of the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries and Yugoslav revisionists that were spread to Vietnam by the French press. These various revisionist theories are what they used to disguise their most reactionary bourgeois ideological essence, which is hostile to socialism and the Labor Party. Because of this, the "Humanities-Good Works" group was greatly praised by the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem group.

However, no matter how hard the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem's "psychological warfare" and propaganda organs shouted for them, they could not save the "Humanities-Good Works" group in the slightest. The Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese intellectual and literary and art circles are fighting to eliminate the ideological tendencies of the "Humanities-Good Works" group, and continue to launch struggles against revisionism in various aspects. We believe that this struggle is actually a fierce struggle between socialism and capitalism, a struggle between the Vietnamese people and the enemy on the cultural, ideological, and political fronts. The significance of this struggle lies not only in its defeat of all hostile ideas, but more importantly in its opening up a broad new stage of development for our culture and art. The initial major victory has made each of us even more excited. After this risk and battle, the ranks of Vietnamese literary and art workers have been further consolidated and united, and the Party's literary and art line has shone with even more brilliant light. Now, a movement to go deep into the laboring masses, carry forward the excellent traditions of the anti-Japanese War literature and art, and move forward by leaps and bounds is unfolding enthusiastically among literary and art workers. They are fighting for the motherland and for socialism.

    越南文艺战线的重大胜利
    越南　阮廷诗
    几个月来，越南文学艺术界向“人文—佳品”集团的反动思想倾向和破坏活动进行了激烈的斗争。这个集团形成于1956年，它的成员是聚集在由河内一家私人出版社出版的“人文报”和“佳品”杂志周围的一部分知识分子和文艺工作者。
    “人文—佳品”集团实质上是一个在文化和文艺领域里的反共联盟。这个联盟的首脑人物就是“精神战”的老手（瑞安）、老牌托洛茨基分子（张酒）、一贯反革命（潘瑰），以及革命投机分子和叛徒（阮友当）等人。他们拉拢了一些曾经参加过抗战的文艺工作者如黎达、陈民、黄琴、子发、士玉、文高、冯贯等人。这些人进城后就被他们拉下水，被资产阶级思想腐蚀以致变质。他们从在路线、思想和文艺上陷入歧途发展到恶毒而疯狂地反对党和人民民主制度。
    1956年底，在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会之后，越南劳动党发现了土地改革工作中的一些错误，并且对党的工作中的某些缺点进行了自我批评。正当这个时候，在农村，一些披着宗教外衣的反动分子和地主与一些流氓、旧伪军、伪政权分子勾结起来，进行破坏活动，阴谋制造暴乱；在城市，资产阶级也在经济、政治、文化各个战线上向党发动进攻，打击党和政府的各项政策，要求开放自由市场、自由经营等等，目的在于反对社会主义。于是，“人文—佳品”集团便以为他们的“时机到来了”，他们串连勾结起来，四处出动，摇旗呐喊。他们得到一些资产阶级反动分子在经济上的帮助，这些资产阶级反动分子给他们提供纸张、印刷厂以及出版和发行的一切方便条件。他们出版了一系列的报刊杂志，如“人文”、“佳品”、“新地”、“创造”、“自由论坛”等，这些反动刊物在所谓“勇敢发现缺点”、“发展马克思列宁主义”等欺骗论调之下，大肆诬蔑、歪曲和打击人民民主制度、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国。“人文”分子采用一切手段，包括腐化、堕落的手段来发展他们的羽翼，挑拨文艺界和党的关系，煽动文艺界反对党的领导。有一些在大学里任教的“人文”分子如陈德草、张酒等，则竭力在大学生中进行拉拢和挑拨，企图制造他们称之为“在越南学校中的波兹南事件”的骚乱。他们还煽动了民主党中的一部分坏分子，筹划在国会举行第六次会议时配合进攻，企图要求改变劳动党和政府的政策和路线，要求同劳动党平分秋色。他们散布舆论，准备成立一个新的“群众的党”，因为按照他们的说法，“越南劳动党已经腐朽，不再是群众的党了”。匈牙利事件爆发后，“人文”分子便明目张胆地在群众面前撕下了假面具。“人文报”刊载文章号召群众为“自由”上街游行，反对政府。这时他们的野心完全暴露了，他们企图效仿匈牙利反革命分子的行动。
    但是，“人文”分子的阴谋并没有得逞，而是像肥皂泡那样破碎了。他们不断地叫嚷“暴风雨将要来到”。暴风雨已经来了，但不是他们所希望的那股反革命的狂风，而是人民群众的疾风，猛烈地刮了起来，吹倒了他们拚命举起来的那面乌烟瘴气的黑旗。在1956年底和1957年初，河内和各大城市的工人、士兵、干部、知识分子、文艺工作者、青年、学生，在党的领导下纷纷起来反击“人文报”所散布的欺诈的充满毒素的论调。这张反动的报纸被河内行政委员会下令停刊了。
    但是，“人文—佳品”集团不愿意痛改前非，他们密谋潜伏下来，以便进行新的破坏阴谋。1957年，张酒、陈德草等更加大力地在学校里发展他们的基础，进行修正主义、反对苏联和社会主义各国、反对越南劳动党的领导的宣传。他们扬言要把大学变成他们的“爆炸阵地”。
    瑞安、阮友当等则指使一些背叛革命的文艺工作者分别潜入各个文艺团体和机关中去，想尽一切办法操纵各刊物编辑部和出版机关，以便刊载一些他们称之为“表现两面”或“埋有地雷”的作品，就是说采取讲两面的方法来继续攻击社会主义和劳动党。他们天天充当帝国主义广播电台如英国“BBC”、“美国之音”、西贡电台的谣言传声筒，他们散发由“精神战”分子供给的反动书报，特别是那些托洛茨基派的政治文艺书籍和美国“自由世界”的反共书报。他们并且更进一步地采取收买、威胁、打击、拉拢的手段，来挑拨离间文艺界和党的领导的关系。另一方面，他们看到革命正在稳步前进，于是他们灰心失望，陷入堕落的生活：酗酒、吸毒……。他们提出这样的口号：“活着要像老庄，吃喝要像资产阶级，讲话要像无产阶级”。他们在烟灯旁筹划要逃到南越或资本主义国家去，因为按照他们的说法，哪里舒服哪里就是他们的祖国。
    在“人文—佳品”集团进行阴险活动的时候，文艺机关的一部分负责同志失去了警惕性或受到了影响。越南文学协会的“文”报登载了一些危险的错误的文章，提出了一些修正主义的观点，违背了党的文艺路线。文协的出版社、俱乐部，在一个时期内也被“人文—佳品”集团严重地操纵着，他们把这些机关变成了他们进行反动宣传的公开讲坛，在政治上和文艺上散布修正主义的观点。
    但是，“人文—佳品”集团的新阴谋又一次遭到了粉碎。1958年初，劳动党组织了五百名文艺工作者及上千名文化工作干部进行学习研究，学习莫斯科会议的两个宣言和国内形势，讨论劳动党中央致全国文艺工作者代表大会（1957年）的信。经过几个月的学习研究，文艺工作者们对文艺战线上的修正主义进行了坚决的斗争，揭露并击溃了各种各样的修正主义的敌对思想和行动。在无可争辩的事实面前，“人文—佳品”集团的骨干分子已不得不低头认罪。一部分过去失去警惕性或受到修正主义影响的同志也认识了自己的错误。在学校里，教师和学生也展开了激烈的斗争，揭破了张酒、陈德草之流的假面具，揭穿了他们的反动阴谋，粉碎了他们曾经大肆宣扬并称之为“新马克思主义”、“继续马克思的事业”的荒谬论调。
    斗争还在继续，至今已取得了重大的胜利。在广大人民面前，“人文—佳品”集团的真面目被揭穿了，他们已经现出了原形，原来是一群专事破坏活动的非常阴险的毒蛇，是人民的敌人，是共产主义和共产党的敌人。正直的知识分子和文艺工作者以及各阶层人民纷纷要求对那些顽固分子加以制裁。
    经过这次斗争，文艺界对“人文—佳品”集团的反动的政治观点和艺术观点也给予了致命的打击。这个集团的托洛茨基派和机会主义分子的“理论家”如张酒、陈德草、阮友当等曾经口口声声自称为马克思列宁主义者，但是他们却提出这样一些反动的论调，说什么“无产阶级专政的任务就是要发展个人自由”，“越南现在不可能进入社会主义”，“越南必须脱离社会主义阵营才能够获得统一”等等。在经济方面，“人文”分子要求给资产阶级以自由经营；在政治方面，他们主张与人民民主制度相对立的自由；在文化和艺术方面，他们把“百花齐放”歪曲为“香花、毒草都可以同样自由地放”。他们叫嚷“把文艺归还文艺家，把业务归还专家，党不能领导文艺。”他们还用尽各种办法来诬蔑共产主义，把它称之为什么“斯大林主义”、“没有良心”、“没有人的文明”、“蹂躏人格”、“把人当作生产工具”等等，他们把共产党人叫做“新的统治阶级的官僚”，把世界各国共产党叫做“斯大林主义体系”。他们这些论调大都是从“自由世界”里搬出来的。他们翻版了国际托洛茨基分子和修正主义分子的陈词滥调。他们并且没有忘掉搬用那些由法国报刊传播到越南来的匈牙利反革命分子和南斯拉夫修正主义的“理论”。这些形形色色的修正主义理论是他们用来掩饰其以社会主义、劳动党为敌的最反动的资产阶级思想实质的东西。正因为这样，“人文—佳品”集团得到美国和吴庭艳集团的大加赞扬。
    但是，尽管美国和吴庭艳的“心理战”和宣传机关怎样声嘶力竭地为他们叫嚷，也没有能够丝毫地挽救了“人文—佳品”集团。越南人民、越南的知识界和文艺界正在进行扫清“人文—佳品”集团的思想倾向的斗争，并且继续在各个方面展开反对修正主义的斗争。我们认为，这场斗争实际上是社会主义同资本主义的激烈斗争，是越南人民同敌人在文化、思想和政治战线上的斗争。这个斗争的意义，不仅在于它击败了一切敌对的思想，而更重要的是在于它为我们的文化艺术开辟了一个广阔的新的发展阶段。初步的重大胜利使我们每个人更为振奋。经过这一场风险和战斗，越南文艺工作者的队伍更进一步巩固和团结了，党的文艺路线发出了更加灿烂的光辉。现在，文艺工作者中间正在热烈地展开一个深入劳动群众，发扬抗战文艺优良传统，大踏步前进的运动，他们正为祖国，为社会主义而奋斗。
