Xinhua News Agency, June 30th: Over eight thousand youths from central government organizations held a celebration and gift-offering rally at the Beijing Gymnasium this morning to commemorate "July 1st." This rally marks a new high tide in the technological revolution movement among the youth of central government organizations. Filled with enthusiasm, the youths presented over a thousand gifts to the Party at the rally. These gifts are a portion of the many new products they rushed to produce, under the inspiration of the General Line and with the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act, on the eve of the Party's birthday. Among these gifts, there are over three hundred pieces that surpass the advanced levels of Britain and the United States and other outstanding inventions and creations. These gifts include new contributions in metallurgy, petroleum, chemicals, textiles, aquaculture, medicine, forestry, and construction. For example, young researchers and all researchers from the Iron and Steel Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, under the leadership of the Party, worked hard for four days and nights and successfully tested a multi-element low-alloy high-strength steel on June 26th. This steel has great uses in transportation and shipbuilding.

Youths from eleven units, including the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Institute of Atomic Nuclear Physics, and the Ministry of Culture, shared vivid stories at the rally about how they boldly created and dared to think and act under the leadership of the Party. In their speeches, they all expressed a common desire: to always listen to the Party, be the vanguards of the technological revolution, learn the most advanced things in the world, and create things that the world does not yet have. Gong Xiewen, a technician from the Chemical Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, wore a set of colorful chemical raincoats, shirts, skirts, gloves, shoes, and socks, made entirely from domestic materials without using foreign raw materials. He also held a chemical umbrella and a handbag, introducing everyone to the new achievements of China's plastics industry, to which the youth have made no small contribution. A group of young actors from the Youth Art Theater of the Ministry of Culture sang and played drums at the rally, introducing the leap forward situation of the youth in their theater. The "Thirteen Tombs Reservoir Rhapsody" performed by this theater will premiere in Beijing tonight to celebrate "July 1st."

Gong Zirong, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Central Government Organizations, and Liu Xiyuan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke at the meeting. They encouraged the members of the Communist Youth League and the youth of the central government organizations to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, have everyone plant a red flag, break down superstitions, create boldly, vigorously engage in the technological revolution, and be the vanguards in surpassing Britain and the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 30th: "No matter how high the mountain peak, we must fly to the top; no matter how far the moon, we must meet Chang'e; never be satisfied with existing achievements, and be determined to strive for greater victories on the basis of victory with the spirit of commanding mountains and rivers and manipulating the sun and moon." This is the solemn oath passed by more than four thousand advanced producers and representatives from all walks of life at the Chongqing Municipal Rally to Celebrate "July 1st," Report Achievements and Offer Gifts to the Party, Implement the General Line, and Vow for the Great Leap Forward.

The rally reviewed the brilliant achievements made by the people of the city in the past six months and put forward new tasks, namely, to develop raw material industries such as steel and non-ferrous metals as soon as possible, and the machinery manufacturing industry with steel equipment and electrical equipment as the primary focus, while vigorously improving technical levels and enriching the strength of manufacturing new equipment, to rapidly advance in the direction of producing high-grade, scarce, cutting-edge, and precision products, and to guarantee the needs of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou in developing steel and other industries.

The more than one thousand pieces of good news and gifts received by the rally fully demonstrated the rapid speed of Chongqing, as the industrial base of the Southwest, in developing the steel and machinery manufacturing industries and improving technical levels. Charts from several steel plants showed that the city's steel production this year could reach 700,000 tons, equivalent to twice the actual production last year. The machinery manufacturing industry has not only manufactured cars and tractors that have never been manufactured before, but also manufactured many large-scale, high-grade products that used to be imported from foreign countries. These achievements show that as long as we break down inferiority complexes, we can not only manufacture what foreign countries have, but also create what the world does not yet have.

More than one million cadres and workers throughout the city listened to the live broadcast of the rally, and factory workers continuously submitted letters of guarantee and determination to the rally. The rally unanimously adopted the oath initiated and signed by well-known advanced producers Huang Rongchang, Liao Shigang, and others: "Further conscientiously implement the General Line, launch a citywide mass leap forward, and build Chongqing into a comprehensive, self-contained, modern industrial city as soon as possible."

    纪念“七一”掀起技术革命的新高潮
    中央国家机关八千青年集会向党献礼
    重庆举行向党报捷献礼大会决心争取更大的胜利
    据新华社30日讯　中央国家机关八千多名青年今天上午在北京体育馆举行庆祝“七一”向党献礼大会。这个大会标志着中央国家机关青年在技术革命运动中走向了一个新的高潮。热情洋溢的青年们在会上向党献了一千多件礼品。这些礼品是他们在总路线的鼓舞下，在党的生日的前夕，以敢想敢作的革命精神赶制出来的许多新产品中的一部分。其中超过英美达到世界先进水平的和其他突出的发明创造有三百多件。在这些礼品中有冶金、石油、化学、纺织、水产、医学、林业、建筑等方面的新贡献。例如冶金部钢铁研究院的青年研究员和全体研究员一起，在党的领导下，苦战四昼夜，在6月26日试验成功一种多元素低合金高强度钢，这种钢在运输、造船方面有很大用途。
    来自化工部、轻工业部、建筑工程部、原子核物理研究所、文化部等十一个单位的青年，在会上介绍了他们在党的领导下如何大胆创造，敢想敢为的生动事迹。他们在发言中都表达了一个共同的愿望：要永远听党的话，做技术革命的急先锋，世界上最先进的东西我们要学会，世界上还没有的东西我们要创造。化学工业部化工研究院技术员龚燮文当场穿了一套不用外国原料，完全由本国原料制成的五光十色的化学雨衣、衬衣、裙子、手套、鞋子、袜子，手里还拿着化学雨伞、提包，向大家介绍了我国塑料工业的新成就，而青年们对这一工业的发展曾经作出了不小的贡献。文化部青年艺术剧院一群青年演员敲锣打鼓，在会上演唱了介绍他们剧院青年跃进的情况。这个剧院表演的“十三陵水库畅想曲”，今晚开始在北京上演，庆祝“七一”。
    中央国家机关党委书记龚子荣和共青团中央书记处书记刘西元分别在会上讲话。他们勉励中央国家机关的共青团员和青年，认真学习毛主席的著作，人人插红旗，破除迷信，大胆创造，大闹技术革命，做超英超美的急先锋。
    据新华社重庆30日电　“山峰再高也要飞上顶，月亮再远也要会嫦娥，永不满足于现有的成就，决心以号令山河、手操日月的气概，在胜利的基础上争取更大的胜利。”这是今天重庆市举行的庆祝“七一”向党报捷献礼，贯彻总路线，全民大跃进誓师大会上，四千多先进生产者和各界代表通过的庄严誓词。
    大会检阅了全市人民半年来取得的光辉成就，提出了新的任务，即尽快地发展钢铁、有色金属等原料工业，和以钢铁设备和电力设备为首要的机械制造工业，同时大力提高技术水平和充实制造新设备的力量，向生产高级、缺门、尖端和精密产品的方向快速前进，保证满足四川、云南、贵州发展钢铁等工业的需要。
    大会收到的一千多件捷报和礼品，充分显示了作为西南工业基地的重庆市，在发展钢铁和机械制造工业以及提高技术水平方面，速度很快。几个钢铁厂的图表说明，今年全市钢的产量可以达到七十万吨，相当于去年实际产量的两倍。机器制造工业，不仅制成了从来没有制造过的汽车、拖拉机，而且制造了许多大型高级的、过去需要从外国进口的产品。这些成就说明，只要破除自卑感，不仅外国有的我们能制造，就是世界没有的我们也可以创造出来。
    全市有一百多万干部、职工收听了大会的实况广播，工厂工人们不断向大会提出保证书、决心书。大会一致通过了著名先进生产者黄荣昌、廖世刚等签名发起的“进一步认真贯彻总路线，在全市掀起全民大跃进高潮，尽快地把重庆建成为一个综合性的自成体系的现代化工业城市”的誓词。（附图片）
