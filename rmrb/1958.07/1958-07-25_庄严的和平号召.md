　　A Solemn Call for Peace
　　The Disarmament and International Cooperation Congress, which has victoriously concluded, has issued a solemn call for peace to the people of all countries: swiftly, actively, and resolutely stop the US-British aggression and safeguard peace in the Middle East and the world! This call reflects the firm wishes of hundreds of millions of people around the world. This call will generate tremendous impetus for the surging mass movement against US-British aggression that has formed worldwide.
　　The task of the seven-day Disarmament and International Cooperation Congress held in Stockholm this time was to strive for disarmament and international cooperation and to eliminate the threat of war. On the eve of the opening of the congress, the US imperialists, in defiance of world opinion, invaded Lebanon; then the British imperialists invaded Jordan, they destroyed peace in the Middle East and pushed the world to the brink of a new war. Approximately 1,200 representatives from more than seventy countries and regions immediately and resolutely responded to this arrogant provocation against peace. On the first day of the congress, a resolution was unanimously passed protesting the US aggression against Lebanon. Subsequently, the congress successively adopted resolutions on the Middle East situation, expressing full support for the people of Iraq and Lebanon; a letter to the United Nations calling for the immediate withdrawal of US-British interventionist forces from the Middle East; and a resolution supporting Khrushchev's proposal to convene a summit conference to discuss the Middle East situation. Throughout the entire congress, there was anger and condemnation of the US-British aggressors and a determination to defend peace in the Middle East and the world. The US delegation also issued a statement supporting the congress's just demand that US armed forces immediately withdraw from the Middle East and nearby seas. The appeal to the people of all countries of the world on the Middle East situation, the appeal of the congress, and the declaration on disarmament adopted at the closing meeting of the congress fully expressed the will of the people of all countries for peace. The 650 million Chinese people who are acting to oppose US-British aggression and defend peace, fully support all the resolutions of the Disarmament and International Cooperation Congress and enthusiastically respond to the congress's call to maintain peace and stop aggression.
　　The current task of all peace-loving countries and peoples is to force the US-British aggressor troops to withdraw from the Middle East. Only by doing this can we stop their further aggression against the Republic of Iraq, the United Arab Republic, and other Arab countries, and ensure peace in the Middle East and the world. The US-British aggressors' frantic provocation against peace has already put themselves in an unprecedentedly isolated predicament, and they are doing their utmost to use various deceptive methods in an attempt to gain a foothold in Lebanon and Jordan in order to further expand their aggression. The Stockholm Congress correctly pointed out that the current aggression must be stopped immediately in order to prevent a conflict from escalating to the point of endangering the future of all mankind. At the same time, the congress demanded that the United Nations assume the responsibility of defending peace, and demanded that a high-level summit meeting be convened to stop the US-British aggression, which is a very urgent task. However, due to the obstruction of the United States and Britain, the Security Council has so far failed to take the necessary action on the withdrawal of US-British aggressor troops from the Middle East. In the spirit of initiating the holding of a summit meeting, the Soviet government agreed to hold a special meeting of the Security Council attended by the heads of state of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India, as well as the relevant Arab countries, to discuss the situation in the Near and Middle East. This is another major effort by the Soviet Union to seek peace and put out the flames of war. The people of all countries should firmly support the Soviet Union's efforts to save peace and urge the special meeting of the Security Council to assume the solemn responsibility of maintaining peace and stopping aggression.
　　The Disarmament and International Cooperation Congress called on the people of all countries to greatly expand activities to stop US-British aggression, expand the scale of these activities, and develop more methods according to their own conditions; the people of the United States and Britain, as well as the people of other countries whose own countries are being used as bases for this aggression, or whose governments support this aggression, have a special responsibility to stop the aggression. This call is timely and necessary. The people of all countries have already taken action and set off a powerful wave of peace. This broad mass movement has already put the aggressors under heavy pressure. We are deeply convinced that as long as the people of the world persevere in their struggle, they will be able to stop war and win peace.
　　The criminal activities of US-British imperialism in invading the Middle East further prove that the struggle of the people of all countries for disarmament is of great significance. As the disarmament declaration of the Disarmament and International Cooperation Congress pointed out: "It is precisely because there are currently and repeatedly serious crises threatening world peace that there is a need to immediately and resolutely embark on the road of disarmament." The Soviet Union has made unremitting efforts to stop nuclear weapons testing and thereby achieve disarmament, and has unilaterally stopped nuclear weapons testing. However, the United States and Britain have been obstructing it and even refuse to stop nuclear weapons testing. And the US generals invading the Middle East have repeatedly flaunted nuclear weapons, clamoring to use atomic weapons to threaten the people of the Middle East, making people deeply feel the threat of nuclear war. Therefore, realizing the tasks put forward in the disarmament declaration of the congress is a major struggle related to human security.
　　The struggle of the people of all countries for peace has repeatedly frustrated the war provocations of the imperialist camp headed

### 庄严的和平号召

　　庄严的和平号召
    已经胜利闭幕的裁军和国际合作大会，向一切国家的人民发出了庄严的和平号召：迅速、积极、坚决地制止美英侵略，维护中东和世界和平！这个号召，反映了全世界亿万人民的坚强愿望。这个号召，对于在全世界范围里形成了汹涌澎湃的反对美英侵略的群众运动，将会发生巨大的推动力量。
    这一次在斯德哥尔摩举行的为期七天的裁军和国际合作大会，任务是争取裁军和国际合作，消除战争威胁。就在大会开幕的前夕，美帝国主义者冒天下之大不韪，侵入黎巴嫩；接着英帝国主义又侵入约旦，它们破坏了中东的和平，把世界推向了新战争的边缘。来自七十多个国家和地区的约一千二百名代表，立即坚决地回答了这个对和平的狂妄挑衅。大会的头一天就一致通过决议，抗议美国侵略黎巴嫩。接着，大会又先后通过了关于中东局势的决议，表示全力支持伊黎两国人民；要求美英干涉军立即撤出中东的致联合国的呼吁书；和支持赫鲁晓夫关于召开首脑会议讨论中东局势的建议的决议。整个大会自始至终充满了对美英侵略者的愤怒谴责和保卫中东和世界和平的决心。美国代表团也发表声明，支持大会要美国武装部队立即撤出中东和附近海面的正义要求。大会闭幕会上通过的关于中东局势的告世界各国人民书、大会的呼吁书和裁军宣言，充分表达了各国人民的和平意志。正在为反对美英侵略、保卫和平而行动起来的六亿五千万中国人民，完全支持裁军和国际合作大会的各项决议，热烈响应大会维护和平、制止侵略的号召。
    一切爱好和平的国家和人民的当前任务是：迫使美英侵略军撤出中东。只有做到这一点，才能制止它们矛头指向伊拉克共和国、阿拉伯联合共和国和其他阿拉伯国家的进一步侵略行动，才能确保中东和世界的和平。美英侵略者对和平的疯狂挑衅，已经使自己陷于空前孤立的困境，正在竭力使用各种欺骗手法，企图在黎巴嫩、约旦站住脚跟，以便进一步扩大侵略。斯德哥尔摩大会正确地指出，必须立即停止现行的侵略，才能制止一次扩大起来足以危及整个人类前途的冲突。同时，大会要求联合国负起捍卫和平的责任，要求召开高级首脑会议，制止美英侵略行动，这是十分迫切的任务。但是，由于美英的阻挠，安理会迄今未能就美英从中东撤退侵略军队采取必要的行动。苏联政府本着倡议举行最高级会议的精神，同意举行由苏、美、英、法、印度五国首脑和有关阿拉伯国家参加的安理会特别会议，讨论中近东局势问题，这是苏联谋求和平、扑灭战火的又一重大努力。各国人民应当坚决支持苏联挽救和平的努力，促使安理会特别会议担负起维护和平制止侵略的庄严责任。
    裁军和国际合作大会号召各国人民根据各国自己的条件大大开展制止美英侵略的活动，扩大这些活动的规模，发展更多的方式；美国和英国的人民，以及自己的国家被人用作这次侵略的基地、或者本国政府支持这次侵略的其他一些国家的人民，负有制止侵略的特别责任。这个号召是及时的必要的。各国人民已经行动起来，掀起了强大的和平浪潮。这一广泛的群众运动，已经使侵略者受到沉重的压力。我们深信，只要全世界人民坚持斗争下去，就能够阻止战争，赢得和平。
    美英帝国主义侵略中东的罪恶活动，进一步证明了各国人民争取裁军的斗争是具有重大的意义。正如裁军和国际合作大会的裁军宣言所指出的：“正是因为目前存在着并且一再出现威胁着世界和平的严重危机，所以需要立即坚决地走上裁军的道路。”苏联为争取停止核武器试验从而实现裁军作了不懈的努力，并单独停止了核武器试验。但美英一直进行阻挠，连停止核武器试验的要求也加以拒绝。而美国侵略中东的将军们，又一再炫耀核武器，以叫嚣使用原子武器来威胁中东人民，使人们深切地感到面临核战争的威胁。因之，实现大会裁军宣言中所提出的任务，是关系人类安全的重大斗争。
    各国人民争取和平的斗争，已经使以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的战争挑衅一再遭到挫败。但和平的敌人并不甘心，美英侵略中东的行动就证明了这一点。各国人民必须加倍努力，彻底击败美英侵略者的战争冒险。美英侵略军一天不滚出中东，各国人民的斗争决不罢休！
