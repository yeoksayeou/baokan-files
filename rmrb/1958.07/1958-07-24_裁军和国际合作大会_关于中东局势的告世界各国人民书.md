    Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference
    Letter to the People of All Countries of the World Regarding the Situation in the Middle East
    The people of the world are facing a grave threat of war. This threat is growing day by day.
    Now is the critical time for the people to voice their opinions, lest the opportunity be lost.
    Following the invasion of Lebanon by the American armed forces, British troops immediately marched into Jordan and were deployed to Libya.
    The United States, Britain, and Turkey are preparing further aggressive plans in the Middle East.
    These actions risk turning the Middle East into a battlefield and threaten peace throughout the world.
    Whether judged on legal or moral grounds, the aggression occurring in the Middle East, which violates the United Nations Charter, is indefensible.
    World public opinion is particularly shocked that the intervention in the Middle East occurred after reports from the United Nations Secretary-General and United Nations observers clearly indicated that the political crisis in Lebanon was a domestic issue, not one of foreign interference.
    These actions should be condemned because they constitute the use of force against people striving to maintain their independence and sovereignty.
    It is the solemn duty of the people of all countries to quickly, actively, and resolutely stop this aggression and safeguard peace in the Middle East and the world.
    The public in many regions of the world has expressed its opinion through large-scale demonstrations, sending delegations to parliaments, and issuing appeals and taking action by trade unions and other organizations, protesting the acts of aggression in the Middle East, demanding the withdrawal of American and British troops, calling for an immediate summit meeting of heads of state, and requesting that the United Nations take effective action in accordance with the Charter.
    The Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference calls for greatly expanding such activities, increasing their scale, and developing more methods according to the conditions of each country.
    The people of the United States and Britain, as well as the people of other countries whose nations are being used as bases for this aggression or whose governments support this aggression, have a special responsibility to strive to stop this aggression.
    Only if the people of the whole world take action by every means possible can the military intervention in the Middle East be stopped. Only in this way can the danger of the world falling into disaster be avoided.

    裁军和国际合作大会
    关于中东局势的告世界各国人民书
    世界人民面临着严重的战争威胁。这种威胁正在与日俱增。
    现在迫切需要人民发出自己的呼声，以免坐失时机。
    在美国武装部队侵略黎巴嫩以后，英国军队紧接着开进了约旦，派到了利比亚。
    美国、英国和土耳其正在准备在中东进行进一步侵略的计划。
    这些行动有使中东沦为战场的危险，并且威胁着全世界的和平。
    无论从法律根据还是从道义根据来说，中东所发生的违反联合国宪章的侵略都是无法辩解的。
    世界舆论特别感到震惊的是，对中东的干涉发生在联合国秘书长和联合国观察员的报告明确说明黎巴嫩的政治危机没有外国的干涉而是国内问题以后。
    这些行动应该受到谴责，因为它们就是使用武力来反对为维护自己的独立和主权而奋斗的人民。
    一切国家的人民的庄严义务就是要迅速、积极、坚决地制止这种侵略，维护中东和世界的和平。
    世界许多地区的公众都通过举行大规模的示威、派代表团去议会以及由工会和其他组织发出呼吁和采取行动的方式表示了自己的意见，抗议在中东的侵略行为，要求美国和英国的军队撤退，要求立即举行国家首脑会议并且由联合国根据宪章采取有效的行动。
    裁军和国际合作大会号召根据各国自己的条件大大开展这样一些活动，扩大这些活动的规模、发展更多的方式。
    美国和英国的人民，以及自己的国家被人用作这次侵略的基地或者本国政府支持这次侵略的其他一些国家的人民，负有特别的责任，应该努力制止这种侵略。
    只有全世界人民用一切办法投入行动，中东的军事干涉才有可能停止。只有这样，世界陷于灾难的危险才能避免。
