    Xi Qihao and "Rapid Cold Phosphating"
    Xi Qihao, a nineteen-year-old worker at the Xi'an Machine Manufacturing Factory, created "Rapid Cold Phosphating," which has advantages surpassing various phosphating methods published internationally.
    Phosphating is a new technology that has developed in the last thirty years and is used for the anti-corrosion performance of metal surfaces. Currently, the most commonly used method in various countries is hot phosphating. This phosphating method requires more complex steam and electrical equipment, and the automation of phosphating treatment is somewhat limited. This type of phosphating generally takes fifteen to twenty minutes per treatment. There is also a rapid method that completes treatment in two to three minutes. A few applications use cold phosphating, but the treatment time for each is more than fifteen minutes.
    The nineteen-year-old worker, Xi Qihao, is only a Grade 2 worker who joined the factory in 1956. After six experiments, he finally succeeded in creating rapid cold phosphating, which takes only two to three minutes to complete. After corrosion and mechanical performance tests, the quality fully meets the requirements. It is five to seven times faster than the existing international level of fifteen minutes.
    "Rapid Cold Phosphating" can be widely used in mechanical industries such as automobiles, tractors, and agricultural machinery, and it opens up new avenues for the automation of phosphating. Due to Xi Qihao's creation, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has named him a technical innovation pacesetter of Xi'an. (Shaanxi Daily)

    席企浩与“快速冷磷化”
    西安机器制造厂十九岁青工席企浩创造“快速冷磷化”，优点超过国际上所公布的各种磷化方法。
    磷化是近三十年来发展起来的一门新型技术，它用于金属表面的防腐效能。目前各国应用较普遍的是热磷化，这种磷化方法需要较复杂的蒸汽电气设备，磷化处理向自动化发展受到一定限制。这种磷化一般要十五至二十分钟处理一次，也有一种在二至三分钟处理完毕的快速法。有少数应用冷磷化，但处理一次的时间都在十五分钟以上。
    十九岁的青工席企浩，只是一个1956年入厂的二级工人。当他经过六次试验，终于获得成功的快速冷磷化，时间上只要二至三分钟完毕。经过腐蚀和机械性能试验，质量完全合乎要求。比现有国际水平十五分钟快五至七倍。
    “快速冷磷化”可以在汽车、拖拉机、农业机械等机械工业中广泛应用，并为磷化的自动化开辟了新的道路。由于席企浩的这一创造，共青团西安市委已命名他为西安市技术革新标兵。　（陕西日报）
