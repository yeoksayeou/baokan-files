Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: The new Ambassador of the Republic of India to China, G. Parthasarathi, accompanied by all the diplomats of the embassy, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China on the afternoon of the 28th.

Present at the occasion were Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Wenjin, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Yu Peiwen, Director of the Protocol Department.

Prior to this, Ambassador G. Parthasarathi had met with Foreign Minister Chen Yi to discuss matters related to the presentation of credentials.

Ambassador Parthasarathi Delivers Speech

When presenting his credentials, Ambassador G. Parthasarathi delivered a speech saying: "Here, I am pleased to recall the long-standing relationship of friendship and mutual understanding between our two countries, as well as our exchanges in art, philosophy, and religion, which have always been based on a spirit of mutual respect, and in a manner worthy of two great cultures of our time.

"From the Han Dynasty, even earlier, our two countries have known each other through peaceful eyes, and nothing has ever damaged our friendly relations and mutual understanding. Today, the world is in a new period of turmoil, but I am pleased to say that this situation has not changed our centuries-old tradition of peaceful coexistence as close and friendly neighbors. I see a reaffirmation of ancient standards in our new relationship.

"Both of our countries have only recently emerged into the modern world as free and independent nations, and we are endowed with the right and obligation to shape our own destiny. While our two countries are each undertaking the great task of transforming society in our own way to adapt to today's needs, we are carefully studying each other's achievements, thereby deepening the mutual understanding between our two peoples of their respective aspirations for a better life. A noble tradition and a great goal have re-established a closer relationship between our two countries: human peace and active efforts to improve the welfare of our people.

"As I begin my tenure as the representative of India to China, I am deeply aware of the historical ties that link our two countries with a long and fruitful record of friendship, and I am equally deeply aware of the newly established relationship. I am referring to the Panchsheel, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which our two Prime Ministers have established as guiding principles in the relations between our two countries. Panchsheel not only reaffirms our long tradition of good neighborliness, but is also the result of our two countries' joint constructive efforts to promote peace.

"We deeply hope that your great country will soon be able to obtain its legitimate position in the international community and bring its wisdom and experience to participate in solving international problems and maintaining peace.

"I am greatly honored to serve as the representative of the Indian government to China, and I would like to assure Your Excellency that I will constantly strive to strengthen the solid foundation of our friendship, expand the scope of our cooperation, and work with you and your government to promote a climate of peace in Asia and throughout the world."

Chairman Mao Zedong Delivers Reply

Chairman Mao Zedong replied, saying: "Since ancient times, there has been a praiseworthy friendship between China and India. We are very pleased to see that since China and India have won liberation and independence respectively, and established diplomatic relations, this traditional and profound friendship has gained new and significant development through the joint efforts of the two governments and peoples. The continuous strengthening of friendly and cooperative relations between China and India not only conforms to the interests of the two peoples, but is also a major force in maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

"Both China and India are peace-loving countries. India's efforts and contributions to the cause of peace have always been highly valued by the Chinese people. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China and India have had a tremendous impact worldwide. At present, international peace is seriously threatened due to the colonialists' aggression against West Asia. I am convinced that China and India will raise the banner of the Five Principles even higher and make due efforts to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

"Mr. Ambassador, I warmly welcome you to serve as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of India to the People's Republic of China. In your work to develop friendly cooperation between China and India and to safeguard world peace, the Chinese government and I myself will provide full assistance and support."

    印度新任驻华大使帕塔萨拉蒂
    向毛泽东主席递交国书
    新华社28日讯　印度共和国新任驻华大使高·帕塔萨拉蒂28日下午偕大使馆全体外交官，向中华人民共和国毛泽东主席递交国书。
    在场的有，国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅，外交部亚洲司司长章文晋，礼宾司司长俞沛文。
    在此以前，高·帕塔萨拉蒂大使曾拜会了陈毅外交部长，商谈递交国书事宜。
  帕塔萨拉蒂大使致颂词
    递交国书时，高·帕塔萨拉蒂大使致颂词说：“在这里，我很愉快地回忆起我们两国之间久已存在的友好和相互谅解的关系，同样也想起我们在艺术、哲学和宗教方面的交流，这种交流始终是基于相互尊重的精神，而且交流的方式也不愧于我们同时代的两大文化。
    “从汉朝，甚至更早的时候开始，我们两国就通过和平的眼光彼此相识，没有任何东西损害过我们的友好关系和相互了解。今天世界正处在新的动荡之中，但是我高兴地说，这种情况并没有改变我们多少世纪以来作为亲密和友好的邻邦而和平相处的传统。我看到在我们的新关系中再度肯定了古老的标准。
      “我们两国都是最近才以自由和独立的国家的姿态出现在现代世界之中的，我们赋有缔造自己命运的权利和义务。我们两国在各自用自己方式进行着改造社会来适应今天的需要的巨大工作的时候，关切地研究了彼此的成就，从而加深了两国人民对彼此追求美好生活的愿望的相互了解。一个崇高的传统和一个伟大的目标使我们两国重又建立了更为密切的关系：人类和平和为增进我们人民的福利而作的积极努力。
      “在我开始担任印度驻华代表的时候，我深切地意识到使我们两国之间有着悠久和有成效的友谊记录的历史联系，我也同样深切地意识到新近建立起来的关系。我所指的就是我们两国总理确定了和平共处的潘查希拉，即五项原则作为两国关系中的指导原则。潘查希拉不仅重申了我们的睦邻关系的悠久传统，而且也是我们两国为促进和平而共同进行的建设性努力的结果。
    “我们深切地希望你们伟大的国家不久就能够在国际社会中取得合法的地位，并且发挥它的智慧和经验来参加解决国际问题和维护和平。
    “我能够担任印度政府的驻华代表，感到很大的光荣，我谨向阁下保证，我将不断努力加强我们友谊的牢固基础，扩大我们的合作的范围，并且同你和贵国政府一起在亚洲和全世界促进和平的气候。”
      毛泽东主席致答词
    毛泽东主席致答词说：“中印两国自古以来就存在着令人传颂的友谊。我们十分高兴地看到，自从中印两国分别赢得解放和独立，并且建立了外交关系以来，这种传统的深厚友谊在两国政府和人民的共同努力下，已经获得了新的重大的发展。中印两国友好合作关系的不断加强不仅符合于两国人民的利益，而且是维护和巩固亚洲和世界和平的重大力量。
      “中印两国都是爱好和平的国家。印度对于和平事业的努力和贡献一向受到中国人民很高的评价。中印两国共同倡导的和平共处五项原则已经在世界范围内产生了巨大的影响。目前由于殖民主义者对西亚的侵略致使国际和平受到严重威胁，我深信，中印两国必将更加高举五项原则的旗帜，为维护亚洲和世界和平作出应有的努力。
      “大使先生，我热诚地欢迎你出任印度共和国驻中华人民共和国的特命全权大使。在你为发展中印两国的友好合作和保卫世界和平而进行的工作中，我国政府和我本人将给予充分的协助和支持。”
