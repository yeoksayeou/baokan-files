Zhoushan's Drinking Water Problem is No More
The Zhoushan Islands consist of over 500 islands, large and small. Since the large-scale water conservancy efforts undertaken last winter and this spring, every island now has a reservoir and a year-round supply of fresh water. Right picture: Shengshan Reservoir on Shengshan Island. In the past, there was a shortage of fresh water here, and sometimes water had to be transported from Shanghai. Now, this is no longer necessary. Left picture: Xia Aimei, a resident of Shengshan Island, draws water from the Shengshan Reservoir. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Shenming.

    舟山饮水不再难
    舟山群岛大小岛屿有五百多个，去冬今春大兴水利以来，做到了岛岛有水库，常年有淡水。右图：嵊山岛的嵊山水库。过去这里淡水缺乏，有时候甚至要到上海去运水，现在就用不着这样做了。左图：嵊山岛上居民夏阿美在嵊山水库取水。  新华社记者  张申明摄
