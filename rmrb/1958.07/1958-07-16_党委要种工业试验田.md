Party committees' leadership over industry has now reached a point where it needs to go a step further. In the past, when Party committees grasped industry, they focused on the planning of industrial development. Through formulating plans, they mobilized all forces and formed a vigorous situation of industry run by the whole people. The splendid scene of local industries blooming everywhere is already in sight. The current problem is, on the one hand, to solve the specific difficulties in realizing the local industrial development plan, such as raw material problems, equipment problems, technical force problems, etc.; on the other hand, to summarize some experiences to guide the construction and production of local industries, so that the development of local industries not only reflects the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical in planning, but also reflects the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical in the construction of each local industrial project and in the production after completion.

To solve the former problem, various localities have created a lot of experience. Generally speaking, it is to rely on the masses, rely on our own efforts, and use the viewpoint of developing production to solve the difficulties in production. To solve the latter problem, various localities have also created a lot of experience. Today, this newspaper publishes the news that the Anhui Provincial Party Committee and the Yangzhou Municipal Party Committee are cultivating experimental plots in the steel industry, which is one of them.

Industrial work, like other aspects of work, with a correct plan, can only be said to have a good plan, and solving the problems of raw materials, equipment, and technical forces can only be said to have prepared the conditions for construction; as for whether the construction can be carried out more quickly, better, and more economically, it depends on how well the work in the entire construction process from design to construction is done. After the factory is built, whether it can carry out production more quickly, better, and more economically depends on how the production management and technical work are done. These are some more specific and detailed issues that can only be resolved by doing more specific and detailed work.

Party committees cultivating industrial experimental plots, personally constructing and managing a factory, and gaining experience from it to guide the general, is the correct way to achieve in-depth and detailed specific leadership. There have been many articles in newspapers and magazines discussing the Marxist leadership method of cultivating experimental plots, which need not be repeated here. From the steel industry experimental plots of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee and the Yangzhou Municipal Party Committee, the effect is also remarkable. Although the steel complex of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee has just started construction, it has already figured out some ways to speed up construction and save construction investment. The local blast furnace of the Yangzhou Municipal Party Committee has become a textbook to guide all units in the city to build local blast furnaces. It can be seen that the Party committee using the method of personally constructing and managing a factory to cultivate industrial experimental plots can easily solve various problems in industrial construction and production.

Agricultural experimental plots played a huge role in the summer harvest battle. If Party committees at all levels come to cultivate industrial experimental plots, they will surely play a huge role in industrial development.

    党委要种工业试验田
    吴滤
    党委对工业的领导，现在已到了一个需要更深入一步的时候了。过去一个时期，党委抓工业，着重抓了发展工业的规划问题。通过制订规划，把各方面的力量都动员起来，形成了一个全民办工业的蓬蓬勃勃的局面，地方工业遍地开花的灿烂景象已在眼前。现在的问题，一方面是要解决实现地方工业发展规划中的具体困难，如原材料问题、设备问题、技术力量问题等等；另一方面是要总结一些经验，来指导地方工业的建设和生产，使得地方工业的发展不仅在规划上体现出多快好省的精神，而且在每一个地方工业项目的建设中，和在建成后投入生产中，同样体现出多快好省的精神。
    解决前一方面的问题，各地已经创造了不少经验。总起来说，是依靠群众，自力更生，用发展生产的观点来解决生产中的困难。解决后一方面的问题，各地也创造了不少经验。今天本报发表的中共安徽省委和扬州市委种钢铁工业试验田的消息，就是其中之一。
    工业方面的工作同其他方面的工作一样，有了正确的规划，还只能说是有了良好的打算，解决了原材料问题、设备问题、技术力量问题等等，也只能说是准备了建设的条件；至于建设能不能进行得多快好省，也还要看从设计到施工一系列建设过程中的工作做得怎么样？工厂建成之后，能不能多快好省地进行生产，更要看生产的管理工作和技术工作做得怎么样？这些，都是一些更具体、更细致的问题，只有做更具体、更细致的工作才能解决。
    党委种工业试验田，亲自建设和管理一个工厂，从中取得经验来指导一般，是实现深入细致的具体领导的正确途径。种试验田这种马克思主义的领导方法，报纸杂志上已经有过许多议论的文章，这里不必重复了。从中共安徽省委和扬州市委的钢铁工业试验田来看，效果也是显著的。中共安徽省委的钢铁联合厂虽然刚开始建设，已在加快建设速度、节约建设投资方面摸出了一些办法，中共扬州市委的土高炉更已成为指导全市各个单位建设土高炉的课本。可见，党委用亲自建设和管理一个工厂的办法来种工业试验田，就不难解决工业的建设和生产中的各种问题。
    农业方面的试验田，在夏收一仗中发挥了巨大的威力，各级党委都来种工业试验田，也一定能在工业的发展中发挥巨大的作用。
