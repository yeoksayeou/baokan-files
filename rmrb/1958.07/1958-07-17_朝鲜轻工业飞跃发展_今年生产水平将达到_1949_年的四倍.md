Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th. Under the general goal of basically solving the problems of clothing, food, and housing within the first Five-Year Plan (1957-1961), North Korea's light industry has recently experienced a leap-forward development.

According to Pyongyang newspapers, the production level of North Korean light industry this year will reach four times that of the pre-war year of 1949. According to the decisions of the June Plenary Session of the Korean Workers' Party, new product trial production groups have been established in light industrial factories to launch mass movements to expand varieties and improve quality.

In order to solve the clothing problem for the Korean people, this year North Korean textile factories will produce 101.46 million meters of various fabrics, reaching nine times that of 1949. By the end of this year, the variety of fabrics produced by factories will increase from 750 to 1,000. In addition, the output of silk and woolen fabrics will be significantly increased. The output of these two types of fabrics this year will reach 2.2 times that of last year.

In order to achieve a production of more than 200 million meters of various fabrics by 1961, large-scale textile factories of the same scale as the current Pyongyang Textile Factory will be newly built in Sinuiju, Hamhung and other places within the first Five-Year Plan, in addition to several silk factories. The existing Pyongyang Textile Factory and other important textile factories and silk factories will undergo large-scale expansion. Among them, the new construction project of the Sinuiju Textile Factory with 60,000 spindles and 2,000 looms will be completed by "August 15th" next year.

The food processing plants of the North Korean Light Industry Ministry will produce 2.3 times the amount of food as last year, and the variety will increase from 120 last year to more than 700 this year. Since the beginning of this year, more than 250 new products have been put into production. The output of sausages and canned food this year will reach ten times and four times that of last year, respectively. In addition, a large number of processed products of vegetables and fruits will be produced.

The production of daily necessities is developing even more rapidly. Since the beginning of this year, factories have trial-produced more than 8,000 new products such as bicycles, watches, sewing machines, and artistic glassware, and put them into production. Next year, the production of daily necessities will be expanded by 10,000 varieties, and the output will reach five to six times that of last year.

During the first Five-Year Plan, North Korea will build a large number of food and daily necessities factories. The Hamhung Meat Processing Plant with an annual output of 5,000 tons of duck meat and the Ryongsong Fruit Cannery will begin construction this year. In addition, a ceramics factory with an annual output of 10 million pieces will be built near Pyongyang.

    朝鲜轻工业飞跃发展
    今年生产水平将达到1949年的四倍
    新华社平壤16日电　在第一个五年计划（1957——1961年）内基本上解决衣食住问题的总的目标下，朝鲜轻工业最近有跃进式的发展。
    据平壤报纸报道，今年朝鲜轻工业的生产水平将达到战前1949年的四倍。根据朝鲜劳动党六月全会的决定，轻工业各厂都成立了新产品试制小组，为扩大品种和提高质量展开群众性的运动。
    为了解决朝鲜人民的穿衣问题，今年朝鲜各纺织厂要生产一亿零一百四十六万公尺的各种织物，达到1949年的九倍。到今年年底各工厂生产的织物品种要由七百五十种增加到一千种。另外，丝织品和毛织品的产量要有显著提高。这两种织品今年的产量要达到去年的二点二倍。
    为了到1961年使各种织物的产量达到二亿公尺以上，在第一个五年计划以内要在新义州、咸兴等地新建像现在的平壤纺织工厂同样规模的大纺织厂，另外还有几个丝织厂。现有的平壤纺织工厂等重要的纺织厂和丝织厂都要进行大规模的扩建。其中有六万纱锭、二千台织布机的新义州纺织工厂的新建工程到明年“八·一五”就要建成。
    朝鲜轻工业省的各食品加工厂今年要生产等于去年的二点三倍的食品，品种要由去年的一百二十种增加到今年的七百多种。今年以来，到现在为止投入生产的新产品已经有二百五十多种。今年的香肠和罐头食品的产量要分别达到去年的十倍和四倍。另外要大量生产蔬菜、水果的加工制品。
    日用品生产更是飞跃发展。今年以来各工厂已经试制了自行车、钟表、缝纫机、艺术玻璃器皿等八千多件新产品，并且投入了生产。明年日用品生产还要扩大一万个品种，在产量上要达到去年的五倍到六倍。
    在第一个五年计划内，朝鲜要建设大量的食品和日用品工厂。今年内要动工兴建的就有年产五千吨鸭肉的咸兴肉类加工厂和龙城水果罐头厂。另外将在平壤附近兴建一个年产一千万件的陶瓷器工厂。
