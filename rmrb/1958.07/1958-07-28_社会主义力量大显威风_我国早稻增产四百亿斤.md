    Socialist Strength Shows Great Power
    China's Early Rice Production Increases by 40 Billion Jin

    Xinhua News Agency, 27th: This year, the nation's early rice harvest has achieved an unprecedented bumper yield, with the total output expected to increase by approximately 40 billion jin compared to last year, reaching around 80 billion jin.

    This heart-stirring figure is estimated by the Ministry of Agriculture based on actual yields reported from various regions. Currently, the early rice harvest in the Pearl River basin is basically complete; the Yangtze and Huai River basins are in the midst of an intense harvest. The nationwide early rice harvesting work is expected to conclude in early August.

    Since the beginning of the early rice harvest, news of bumper yields has been constantly pouring in from various regions. This year, due to the expansion of early rice planting areas in various regions, and especially the leap in yield per unit area, the total early rice output in various provinces has grown rapidly. Based on the partially harvested early rice, the total early rice output in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangdong will increase by nearly double or more than double compared to last year.

    As the harvesting progresses, more and more high-yield early rice "satellites" and large-area bumper harvest records are emerging in various regions. So far, the "satellite" released by Guihu Agricultural Cooperative in Boyang County, Jiangxi Province, is the highest, with an average yield of 9,195 jin and 13 liang per mu for 1.3007 mu of early rice. High-yield records of 1,000 jin to over 5,000 jin per mu have appeared in Hunan, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Yunnan, Fujian, Anhui, Guangdong, and other provinces. According to statistics, Guangdong Province has more than 64,000 mu of high-yield fields with over 1,000 jin, and Anhui Province has several thousand mu with over 5,000 jin. The average yield per mu in counties such as Fushun in Sichuan, Yizhang in Hunan, and Shishou in Hubei will exceed 600 jin. The average yield of more than 650,000 mu of early rice that has already been harvested in Jinjiang Prefecture, Fujian Province, has reached 601 jin, and the average yield per mu of more than 180,000 mu of early rice in Minhou County has exceeded 800 jin.

    The early rice bumper harvest, following the summer grain crop bumper harvest, is another victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction; the fact of the early rice bumper harvest further shattered the argument that "agricultural production cannot be accelerated," and many "autumn reckoning faction" members have had to admit defeat in the face of the facts. Huang Jiuxian, a well-to-do middle peasant who used to work individually in Longshaping, Yizhang County, Hunan Province, openly bet with the agricultural cooperative that if the cooperative's early rice yield reached 700 or 800 jin per mu, he could cook rice with his palm. The cooperative's early rice yield target was achieved, and he not only admitted defeat but also applied to join the cooperative.

### 社会主义力量大显威风  我国早稻增产四百亿斤

    社会主义力量大显威风
    我国早稻增产四百亿斤
    新华社27日讯　今年全国早稻获得空前大丰收，总产量将比去年增加四百亿斤左右，达到八百亿斤左右。
    这个动人心弦的数字是农业部根据各地实收情况估算的。目前，珠江流域的早稻已经基本收完；长江和淮河流域正在紧张收打。全国早稻收获工作将在8月初结束。
    从早稻收割开始，大丰收的喜讯就不断由各地传出。今年由于各地早稻种植面积都有所扩大，特别是单位面积产量飞跃提高，各省早稻总产量飞快增长。根据已经收打的部分早稻推算，江苏、浙江、江西、四川、湖南、湖北、云南、贵州、广东等省早稻总产量都将比去年增加近一倍或一倍以上。
    随着收打工作的进展，各地出现的早稻高产“卫星”和大面积丰产纪录越来越多。到目前止，江西省波阳县桂湖农业社放出的“卫星”最高，这个社有一·三○○七亩早稻平均亩产达到九千一百九十五斤十三两。湖南、四川、浙江、云南、福建、安徽、广东等省都出现了亩产一千斤到五千斤以上的高产纪录。据统计，广东省有千斤以上的丰产田六万四千多亩，安徽省五千斤以上的有好几千亩。四川省富顺、湖南省宜章和湖北省石首等县全县平均每亩产量都将超过六百斤。福建省晋江专区已经收打结束的六十五万多亩早稻平均产量达到六百零一斤，闽侯县有十八万多亩早稻平均亩产超过了八百斤。
    继夏收粮食作物大丰收以后的早稻大丰收，是党的社会主义建设总路线的又一胜利；早稻大丰收的事实进一步击破了“农业生产速度快不了”的论调，不少“秋后算账派”已不得不在事实面前服输。湖南省宜章县龙沙坪单干富裕中农黄九贤曾和农业社公开打赌说，如果社里早稻亩产达到七、八百斤，他就能用手掌煮饭。社里早稻产量指标达到了，他不仅认了输，还申请入了社。
