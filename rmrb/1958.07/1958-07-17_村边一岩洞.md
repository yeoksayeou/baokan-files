Spreading a Net of Justice: Enemies Cannot Escape

    A Cave by the Village

    After attending the security movement oath-taking rally, Qin Kelong, the security director of the Qiaoxian Township Agricultural Cooperative in Shanglin County, Guangxi, couldn't fall asleep. He thought about how the bandit leader Luo Tianming had been operating in the mountains in this area for the past seven or eight years, emerging at night and hiding during the day, which was a major threat to the safety of the masses and the great leap forward in production.

    However, over the past seven or eight years, the masses in the entire township had cooperated with public security personnel to conduct many searches, going through all the large and small mountains and caves, but they had never caught this bandit leader. Where had he gone? Scenes of past mountain searches appeared one after another in his mind, silently counting each mountain and each cave... "Ah! Baxian Cave hasn't been checked." His heart suddenly lit up. This cave was only three hundred steps away from the village, and passers-by could see it just by looking up. Everyone assumed that bandit leader Luo Tianming wouldn't dare to hide in this cave, so they had never searched it. "This is a loophole. I might as well take a look tomorrow."

    As soon as he arrived at Baxian Cave, Qin Kelong walked inside while remaining vigilant. After walking a short distance, he found a sack on the ground, a bamboo tube containing water, and a blackened mouth cup. Qin Kelong immediately became nervous: "Whose things are these? Could bandit leader Luo Tianming really be here?" Looking carefully further inside, in a dimly lit area, he saw a person sleeping with a gun in their arms. "It's Luo Tianming!"

    "Who? What are you doing here?" Qin Kelong was about to retreat from the cave when the bandit was awakened. As he got up, he pulled the bolt of his gun and shouted, "Where do you live? What's your name?"

    "Looking for water for drought resistance, living in Qiaoxian Market."

    Qin Kelong tricked the bandit, retreated from the cave, and ran away. He happened to run into the cooperative director, told him about the situation inside the cave, and asked the director to stay nearby to monitor. He ran back to the township to report to the public security personnel and militiamen.

    The cunning bandit, seeing Qin Kelong leave, grabbed his gun and rushed out of the cave, running up the mountain.

    When the villagers in the township heard that bandit leader Luo Tianming was in Baxian Cave, they followed the public security personnel and militiamen to surround Baxian Cave and the entire mountain. After running out of bullets, Luo Tianming attempted to break through the encirclement, but happened to encounter Qin Kelong blocking his path. Qin Kelong leaped forward and hugged the bandit. After a long hand-to-hand fight, with the assistance of the militiamen and the masses, they finally captured Luo Tianming alive.

    村边一岩洞
    覃克隆参加安全运动誓师大会回来，躺在床上老是睡不着。他是广西上林县乔贤乡农业社的治安主任，他想到匪首罗天明七八年来，老是在这一带的山里夜出昼没，的确是群众安全和生产跃进的一大祸害。
    可是，七八年来，全乡群众配合公安人员进行了好多次搜捕，远近的大小山岭、岩洞搜过了好几遍，都没有抓到这个匪首。到那里去了呢？过去上山搜捕的情景一幕一幕地在他脑里出现，心里默默数着每个山每个洞，……“啊！就是岜贤洞没有去检查过。”他的心忽然亮了。这个洞就在庄前三百多步远的山上，过路的人抬头就可以看到这个山洞，大家都估计匪首罗天明不敢隐藏在这个岩洞里，因此，就没有到这个山洞里去搜查过。“这是个漏洞，明天不妨去看看。”
    一到岜贤岩，覃克隆就一面警惕着一面往里面走，走了不多远就发现地上有个麻袋，有个竹筒装着水，还有一个熏得黑黑的口盅。覃克隆立刻紧张起来：“这是谁的东西？难道匪首罗天明真在这里？”再往前仔细一看，里面半明半暗的地方，有一个人抱着一枝枪在睡觉。“是罗天明！”
    “谁？来干什么的？”覃克隆正想退出洞来，土匪已被惊醒了。他一爬起来，就边拉枪拴，边叫：“家住那里？叫什么名字？”
    “找水源抗旱来的，住乔贤墟。”
    覃克隆骗过了土匪，退出洞来拔腿就跑。恰巧碰上了社主任，就把洞内情况说了一遍，并叫社主任留在附近监视，他飞跑回乡报告公安人员和民兵去了。
    狡猾的土匪，见覃克隆一走，就拿着枪冲出洞来，往山上跑了。
    乡里的群众一听说匪首罗天明在岜贤岩内，都跟着公安人员和民兵把岜贤岩一个山团团围住。罗天明在子弹打完后，企图冲出重围时，恰巧又碰上覃克隆拦住了去路。覃克隆一跃上前抱住了土匪，两人肉搏多时，在民兵和群众协助下，终于生擒了罗天明。
