Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 27th: President Nasser of the United Arab Republic (UAR) said on the 27th that the UAR aspires to bring prosperity to its people. The country will continue to build and is prepared to repel foreign aggression.

Nasser also said, "We are facing a world crisis caused by the American occupation of Lebanon and the British occupation of Jordan."

Nasser made these remarks while delivering a speech at the inauguration ceremony of the Helwan Iron and Steel Plant, 35 kilometers south of Cairo.

During his speech, Nasser asked U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to recall their meeting in Cairo in 1953. Nasser said that during that meeting, "I told him that the Arab world cannot accept military alliances or treaties because we must never drive the British occupiers out the front door only to let joint occupation under the name of the Baghdad Pact or any other treaty enter through the window." He emphasized that since that meeting, he had repeatedly told Dulles the same thing.

Nasser reiterated his confidence and determination to resist aggressors. He said: "What we need is an Arab nation for Arabs, and any aggression against Arabs will be repelled by Arabs, and any aggression against Arab nations is an aggression against us."

He said: The steel plant inaugurated today is the realization of a long-cherished dream of the Egyptian people. It is also the realization of promises made but never kept by the old regime.

He asked the approximately 2,000 workers and staff currently at the plant to work hard for the welfare of society and to improve the still low living standards of the people.

He said: Egyptian private capital was originally invested in agriculture, but after the promulgation of the land reform law and the law restricting the construction of buildings in the city, private capital shifted to industry.

He also said that the Helwan Iron and Steel Plant will not only serve the two regions of the UAR but also the entire Arab nation.

The total capital of the "Egyptian Iron and Steel Company" is approximately 19 million Egyptian pounds, of which 45% is owned by the government and the remainder is private investment. The West German Demag Company provided all the equipment for the steel company and owns approximately 20% of the shares.

The construction of this steel plant began in 1955, and the construction work was temporarily suspended when Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt. In 1957, the steel plant partially went into production, and when it is fully operational, it will produce approximately 200,000 tons of steel per year. It is the largest steel plant in the Middle East. The steel plant uses iron sand from Aswan and coking coal from the Soviet Union and West Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 28th: According to a report in "People's Daily" on the 27th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the UAR recently summoned diplomats from some Western countries stationed there, warning them to report the truth about the UAR and the situation in the Middle East to their governments. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told them that in the future, "it may be necessary to take the usual diplomatic measures against them."

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out to these Western diplomats that the reports they made to their governments were not based on facts but on distorted propaganda from American, British, French, or Israeli newspapers. As a result, their governments had formed an incorrect view of the policies of the UAR.

    纳赛尔重申维护民族独立决心
    阿联准备击退侵略
    新华社开罗27日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔27日说，阿拉伯联合共和国渴望带给人民的是繁荣。国家将继续进行建设，并且准备击退外国的侵略。
    纳赛尔还说，“我们正面临着由于美国侵占黎巴嫩和英国侵占约旦所造成的世界危机。”
    纳赛尔是在开罗以南三十五公里的赫万钢铁厂的落成典礼上发表演说时这样说的。
    纳赛尔在讲话时要美国国务卿杜勒斯回忆他们1953年在开罗的会谈。纳赛尔说，在那次会谈中，“我对他说，阿拉伯世界不能接受军事同盟或条约，因为我们绝不能把英国占领者从大门赶出去，而让以巴格达条约或任何其他条约为名义的联合占领从窗口进来。”他着重指出，从那次会谈以来，他对杜勒斯又反复讲了同样的话。
    纳赛尔再次表示了反击侵略者的信心和决心。他说：“我们需要的是阿拉伯人的阿拉伯国家，对阿拉伯人的任何侵略都将为阿拉伯人所击退，并且对阿拉伯国家的任何侵略也就是对我们的侵略。”
    他说：今天落成的钢铁厂是埃及人很久以来梦寐以求的理想的实现。这也是旧政权所作的但是从来没有遵守的诺言的实现。
    他要求目前这个厂数达两千名左右的工人和职员为了社会的福利和提高目前仍然很低的人民的生活水平而努力工作。
    他说：埃及的私人资本原来是投在农业的，但是在土地改革法以及限制在城内建造建筑物的法律颁布后，私人资本就转到了工业。
    他还说，赫万钢铁厂不仅将为阿拉伯联合共和国的两个地区服务，并且将为整个阿拉伯民族服务。
      “埃及钢铁公司”总资本约一千九百万埃镑，其中45％为政府所有，其余为私人投资。西德的德马克公司向这个钢铁公司提供了全部设备，它拥有股份的20％左右。
    这座钢铁厂在1955年开始建设，英、法和以色列三国侵略埃及时，使建设工作暂时停顿。1957年这座钢铁厂部分投入生产，全部投入生产时年产约二十多万吨钢。它是中东最大的钢铁厂。钢铁厂使用阿斯旺的铁砂和苏联和西德的焦炭。
    新华社开罗28日电　据“人民报”27日报道，阿拉伯联合共和国外交部最近召见了驻在这里的一些西方国家的外交官，警告他们要向本国政府报告阿拉伯联合共和国和中东局势的真象。外交部告诉他们说，以后，“可能不得不对他们采取通常的外交措施”。
    外交部向这些西方外交官指出，他们向他们的政府所作的报告不是根据事实，而是根据美国、英国、法国或以色列的报纸所作的歪曲宣传。因此，他们的政府对阿拉伯联合共和国的政策形成了不正确的看法。
