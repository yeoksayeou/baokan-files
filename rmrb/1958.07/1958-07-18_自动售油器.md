    Automatic Oil Dispenser
    The Tianmu First Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yuqian County, Zhejiang Province, has manufactured an automatic oil dispenser. Using it to sell oil increases work efficiency dozens of times compared to the old method of using ladles or scales.
    To use the automatic oil dispenser, the customer simply places the oil bottle under the oil spout. They state the required quantity, and the salesperson presses a button above, which dispenses the exact amount of oil into the bottle.
    This automatic oil dispenser is made of ordinary leather and costs only about thirty yuan per unit.

    自动售油器
    在浙江省于潜县天目第一供销合作社制成一台自动售油器。用它售油比原来用提或秤的老办法提高工作效率数十倍。
    使用自动售油器，顾客只要把油瓶放在下面的漏油处。说出需要数量，营业员在上边按一下揿钮，就照数把油装入瓶内。
    这种自动售油机，是用普通皮制成的，每台工本只花三十元左右。
