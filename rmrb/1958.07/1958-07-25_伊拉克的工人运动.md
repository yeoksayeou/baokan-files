    The Iraqi Workers' Movement
    Iraq, A'ma'er

    The Iraqi working class emerged and grew after the First World War, when Britain had established direct rule over Iraq, and foreign trusts (especially oil companies) controlled Iraq's domestic economy, built railways, and expanded the port of Basra. Before this, Iraq had only many craftsmen.

    The history of the Iraqi workers' movement is closely linked to the national independence movement. Since 1917, after the British occupied Iraq, the Iraqi people, including all social classes and religious groups, united to resist the British colonialists. Many riots occurred throughout the country. In Najaf (a religious center), there was a struggle against the British. The city of Najaf was originally able to continue a long-term struggle, but due to the betrayal of several lackeys, the British finally conquered this heroic city. Eleven heroes were hanged, including a worker named Haji Najm Bakal.

    In 1920, a large-scale anti-British struggle broke out. Workers participated in this struggle. The first martyr to be sacrificed was a worker named Hassan Aklas.

    While participating in the national independence movement, the workers also continued to fight for economic demands.

    In 1927, in Sharqiya, Baghdad, workers protested against the insults of British business owners and forced them to pay workers for weekend holidays.

    As a result of the workers' struggle and the improvement of their class consciousness, the first trade union federation was established in 1929 under the name of "Craftsmen's Association." The activities of these organizations were limited to some simple demands not exceeding the scope of wages and working hours. Workers participated in many major strikes. The most important was the general strike against heavy taxes in August 1931, and the Baghdad strike in 1935 demanding a reduction in electricity bills (the British controlled the power station). These two strikes were two great victories in the people's struggle and the trade union struggle.

    The government authorities serving imperialism cracked down on the "Craftsmen's Association" and exiled the chairman of the association (Muhammad Saleh al-Khazzaz) to a remote area in the north. Other leaders of the "Craftsmen's Association" were also hunted down.

    But the workers continued to struggle. The workers held many strikes to fight for the right to organize trade unions—demanding the promulgation of a labor law: such as strikes in the Iraqi Petroleum Company, on the railways, in the port of Basra, and in other enterprises represented and managed by imperialist trusts. Imperialist and local officials were finally forced to meet the workers' demands. As a result of the workers' struggle, Legislation No. 72 was promulgated in 1936, which, although had many shortcomings, allowed workers the right to organize trade unions. However, due to the tension of the international situation and the intensification of anti-democratic and freedom activities by imperialism and its agents, especially the failure of the coup in 1936, the trade unions were not organized. During this coup, several large demonstrations with thousands of workers participating broke out in Baghdad.

    The demonstrating masses shouted: Down with the evil fascism!

    This slogan was the main slogan of the working class and all progressive forces in the world at that time.

    Between 1944 and 1945, due to the workers' continued struggle and the introduction of democratic ideas, workers were allowed to establish nineteen trade unions. Among these trade unions were the railway workers' union and the port workers' union—with 15,000 workers participating. Although the oil workers had made the same request, the Iraqi reactionary government, under the direction of foreign companies, consistently refused to allow them to form a trade union.

    The reactionary government consistently refused to meet the workers' legitimate demands for improved working conditions and the implementation of labor laws. In 1944, there were many major railway strikes. The workers' demands were simple and reasonable, for example, they demanded wage increases and the establishment of local committees of trade unions in various industrial cities. But the Iraqi reactionary government, under the orders of British General Smith, the manager of the railway company, arrested the leaders of the trade unions and dismissed many workers. The police searched the homes of worker activists, and the railway workers' union was also banned.

    In 1946, oil workers in Kirkuk also organized a huge strike demanding the right to organize trade unions guaranteed by labor law. But this strike was strongly suppressed by the reactionary government. The police opened fire on striking workers gathered in a park called "Ghaur Bochi", carrying out a terrible massacre. Many workers died, and hundreds of workers were arrested or dismissed. This criminal act of the Iraqi reactionary government aroused great indignation among all strata and parties in Iraq, as well as the national press, and set off a huge protest movement throughout the country.

    At the end of 1946, the postal and telecommunications workers' union was banned after a strike launched by its members.

    The conspiracy of imperialism and reactionaries against the working class is obvious: they want to paralyze the trade union movement.

    Trade unions were banned in 1947.

    When British imperialism attempted to force the Iraqi people to accept the enslaving Portsmouth Treaty (to replace the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty), the reactionaries severely cracked down on the national independence movement and the workers' movement: the National United Party and the People's Party were declared illegal. Many newspapers were also closed.

    But all patriotic forces of the Iraqi people did not yield. In January 1948, the Iraqi people held a powerful uprising and finally tore up this treaty. Workers played an important role in this movement.

    Shortly after this uprising, the workers took advantage of the development of the national movement and legally organized a grand mass rally for the first time on "May Day", and successfully restored the disbanded trade union organizations. However, the persecution of the trade union movement by the reactionaries became even more intense. They took advantage of the opportunity of the Palestine War to declare martial law and retaliate against the national movement, especially the working class. The reactionaries seized the various rights that the working class had gained during the uprising in January 1948.

    During this period, a large-scale strike occurred in an area called "K3", and more than 7,000 workers also went on strike in various areas of the desert. They put forward some legitimate demands that complied with the provisions of the labor law. The strike continued for many days and cut off the flow of oil in the pipeline. It is estimated that the oil trusts suffered losses of as much as one million pounds. But the reactionaries, under the instruction of imperialism and foreign trusts, expelled the workers and deprived them of food and water. The striking workers were forced to walk 300 kilometers from their work location to Baghdad to petition, but the reactionary government authorities sent police to ambush them along the way.

    The reactionary government established a police system throughout the country; hundreds of patriotic people were thrown into prison, and the best sons and daughters of the people were killed in the capital.

    In 1951, the workers decided to re-establish the trade union movement. All previously banned trade unions resumed their activities, and the workers elected the "Standing Bureau of the Iraqi Trade Union Council."

    But this trade union movement only lasted for six months, because the reactionaries were unwilling to see the workers united again and feared that the Iraqi workers would unite with the national liberation movement in the Arab world.

    When the Egyptian worker brothers were engaged in heroic battles with British soldiers in the Gaza area, the Iraqi workers organized large-scale strikes and extensive mass movements to support them. At a mass rally organized by the "Standing Bureau of the Iraqi Trade Union Council," thousands of workers passed a telegram supporting the Egyptian trade union, in which they expressed their support and concern for the Egyptian workers fighting against the British occupation.

    A few days after this historic mass rally, the police searched the "Trade Union Building" and arrested the worker leaders. The Standing Bureau of the Iraqi Trade Union Council and many trade unions were banned.

    The workers and all nationalities and democratic forces in Iraq participated in the 1952 uprising against imperialism and for direct elections and democratic freedoms. Imperialism was then trying to pull Iraq into the imperialist "Middle East Command." After the police failed to stop the people's demonstrations, the army occupied the major cities; martial law was declared, traffic was cut off; all parties were banned from activities, and the remaining trade unions were also banned. Approximately more than two thousand citizens were thrown into prisons and concentration camps, a large part of whom were workers.

    The reactionaries were not satisfied with these. In 1953, they carried out two major massacres in political prisons. In the prisons of Baghdad and Kut, the police opened fire on political prisoners: eighteen patriotic people died, and one hundred and ninety-two were injured. Among them were people who participated in trade unions, as well as ordinary workers.

    After this period, the difficult situation forced the working class to go underground and carry out secret trade union struggles. The workers tried to take all legal forms to carry out the struggle, and established the Iraqi Workers' High Committee. It represents the various grass-roots committees established by workers in various factories and industrial sectors. The purpose of the High Committee is to cultivate a strong core for the future trade union movement, improve and develop the ability to carry out mass work among workers, and drive workers to carry out struggles to win satisfaction of their legitimate demands. The responsibility of the committee is to educate this core of workers with the trade union movement and patriotic spirit.

    At the same time, the High Committee continued to work hard to obtain the legal right to be allowed to establish trade unions. But no results were obtained, because the reactionary government consistently held a hostile attitude towards all legitimate demands of the workers.

    In 1956, when British and French imperialism and Israel invaded Egypt, the Iraqi people organized peaceful demonstrations to support the Egyptian people. But the lackey of the imperialist trusts, the Said government, opened fire on the people, and peaceful demonstrations turned into popular resistance and uprisings throughout the country. Many patriots were killed, and trade union leaders were arrested. But this uprising powerfully struck at imperialism's aggression against Egypt and its conspiracy to threaten Syria.

    The Iraqi trade unions continued to operate after this, publishing secret newspapers and participating in the international trade union movement. Iraqi trade union representatives attended most international trade union conferences. For example, two Iraqi trade union representatives attended the Fourth World Trade Union Congress held in Leipzig and participated in the Moscow celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    The uprising on July 13th this year completely destroyed the Faisal feudal dynasty of the imperialist agents. This is a great victory for the Iraqi national independence movement, and also a victory for the Iraqi workers' movement. The Iraqi working class will, together with all patriotic forces, hold high the banner of national independence and freedom and democracy, stand in the ranks of the struggle against imperialism, and make its own contributions.

    伊拉克的工人运动
    伊拉克　阿玛尔
    伊拉克的工人阶级是在第一次世界大战以后出现并成长起来的，当时英国已对伊拉克实行了直接统治，外国托辣斯（特别是石油公司）控制了伊拉克国内的经济、建立了铁路并且扩大了巴士拉港口。在这以前，伊拉克只有很多的手工业者。
    伊拉克工人运动的历史是和民族独立运动紧密地联系在一起的。自从1917年，英国人占领了伊拉克之后，伊拉克人民，包括所有社会各阶层和宗教集团，都一致起来反抗英国殖民者。全国各地都发生了多次暴动。在安那查夫（宗教中心）曾发生过一次反对英国人的斗争。安那查夫城本来能够继续进行长期的斗争，但是由于几个走狗的叛变，终于使英国人征服了这个英勇的城市。十一位英雄被绞死，其中有一位名叫哈治·纳杰姆·巴卡尔的工人。
    1920年，爆发了一场规模巨大的反英斗争。工人们参加了这次斗争。第一个牺牲的烈士就是一位名叫哈森·阿克拉斯的工人。
    工人们在参加民族独立运动的同时，也继续进行了经济要求的斗争。
    1927年时，在巴格达的夏尔久亚，工人们曾抗议过英国企业主的侮辱，并迫使他们付给工人以周末假期的工资。
    由于工人们进行斗争的结果，以及他们的阶级觉悟的提高，1929年在“手艺工人协会”的名目下成立了第一个总工会。这些组织的活动仅限于某些不超过工资和工时问题范围的简单要求。工人们参加了多次大罢工。最重要的一次是1931年8月反对苛税的总罢工，还有一次是1935年巴格达要求削减电费的罢工（英国人掌握着电力站）。这两次罢工是人民斗争和工会斗争中的两次伟大的胜利。
    为帝国主义服务的政府当局打击“手艺工人协会”并把协会的主席（穆罕默德·萨莱·阿尔—卡扎兹）流放到北部一个偏僻的地区。“手艺工人协会”的其他领袖们也遭到了追缉。
    但是工人们仍然继续进行斗争。工人们曾为争取组织工会的权利——要求颁布一项劳工法——举行了多次罢工：如在伊拉克石油公司、在铁路上、在巴士拉港口和其他由帝国主义托辣斯代表统治管理的企业中都发生了罢工。帝国主义和地方官员最后都被迫满足了工人们的要求。由于工人们斗争的结果，1936年颁布了第七十二号立法，虽然这项立法有许多缺点，但还是允许了工人们有组织工会的权利。可是，由于国际形势的紧张以及帝国主义及其代理人反民主自由活动的加强，特别是1936年政变的失败，工会没有组织成。在这次政变时，巴格达曾爆发了好几次有几千工人参加的大示威。
    示威群众高呼：打倒万恶的法西斯主义！
    这一口号在当时是全世界工人阶级和所有进步力量的主要口号。
    在1944年到1945年间，由于工人们的继续斗争和民主思想的传入，工人们被允许建立了十九个工会。在这些工会中有铁路工会和港口工人工会——有一万五千工人参加。尽管石油工人们曾提出过同样的要求，可是伊拉克反动政府在外国公司的指使下，始终拒绝允许他们成立工会。
    反动政府一贯拒绝满足工人们关于改善劳动条件和实行劳工法的合法要求。1944年，发生了许多次铁路大罢工。工人们的要求是简单而且合情合理的，例如，他们要求增加工资，在各工业城市成立工会的地方委员会。但是伊拉克的反动政府却在英国将军史密斯、铁路公司经理的命令下，逮捕了各工会的领导人并且解雇了很多工人。警察搜查了工人积极分子的住处，铁路工会也遭到取缔。
    在1946年，卡尔柯克石油工人们也组织了一次巨大的罢工，要求劳工法所保证的组织工会的权利。但这次罢工受到反动政府的强力的镇压。警察对集合在一个名叫“伽乌尔·波奇”的公园中的罢工工人们开了火，进行了一次可怕的屠杀，许多工人死亡，数百个工人被逮捕或解雇。伊拉克反动政府的这一罪恶的行为，引起了伊拉克各阶层、各党派以及全国的报界的极大的愤慨，并在全国掀起了一个巨大的抗议运动。
    1946年年底，邮电工人工会在会员工人发动的一次罢工后遭到禁止活动。
    帝国主义和反动派对待工人阶级的阴谋是很明显的：他们想使工会运动瘫痪。
    工会在1947年被禁止活动。
    当英国帝国主义企图迫使伊拉克人民接受奴役性的朴茨茅斯条约（以代替1930年的英伊条约）的时候，反动派对民族独立运动和工人运动进行了严重的打击：民族联合党和人民党都被宣布为非法。许多报纸也被封闭。
    但是伊拉克人民的一切爱国力量并没有屈服。在1948年1月，伊拉克人民举行了一次强大的起义，终于撕毁了这一条约。工人们在这次运动中起了重要的作用。
    在这次起义后不久，工人们利用了民族运动的发展形势，第一次在“五一节”合法地组织了盛大的群众大会，并且成功地恢复了已遭解散的工会组织。然而反动派对工会运动的迫害却更加紧了。他们利用巴勒斯坦战争的机会宣布战时法，对民族运动，特别是工人阶级进行报复。反动派夺取了工人阶级在1948年1月起义时所获得的各种权利。
    在这段时期，一个被称“K3”的地区发生了一次大规模的罢工，在沙漠地带的各地区，也有七千多工人举行了罢工。他们提出了某些符合于劳工法规定的合法要求。罢工继续了好多天，并且断绝了输油管中石油的流运。人们估计，石油托辣斯受到的损失达一百万英镑之多。但是反动派在帝国主义和外国托辣斯的授意下，驱逐了工人们，并且不给他们食物和水。罢工工人被迫从工作地点步行三百公里到巴格达去请愿，但是反动的政府当局却派了警察在中途狙击他们。
    反动政府在全国建立了警察制度；几百名爱国志士被投入监狱，人民的最优秀的子女在首都遭到了杀戮。
    1951年工人们决定重新恢复工会运动。所有以前遭到禁止的工会都恢复了活动，工人们并选举了“伊拉克工会理事会常设局”。
    但是这次工会运动只延续了六个月，因为反动派不愿重又看到工人们团结一致，并且害怕伊拉克的工人们和阿拉伯世界的民族解放运动相联合。
    当埃及工人兄弟们在加沙地区向英国士兵进行英勇战斗的时候，伊拉克工人们组织了支援他们的大规模罢工和广泛的群众运动。在“伊拉克工会理事会常设局”所组织的一次群众大会上，数千工人通过了一个支援埃及工会的电报，他们在电文中表示了对为反抗英国占领而战斗的埃及工人们的支援和关怀。
    在这次历史性的群众大会之后几天，警察就搜查了“工会大厦”并且逮捕了工人领袖。伊拉克工会理事会常设局和许多工会都遭到禁止。
    工人们和伊拉克所有各民族以及民主的力量在一道参加了1952年反对帝国主义、争取直接选举制度和民主自由的起义。帝国主义当时力图把伊拉克拉入帝国主义的“中东司令部”。当警察阻止人民示威遭到失败后，军队就占领了各主要城市；宣布了战时法令、断绝交通；各党派都被禁止活动，剩下的一些工会也遭取缔。约有二千多市民被投入监狱和集中营，其中很大一部分是工人。
    反动派并不满足于这些。1953年，他们在政治监狱中进行了两次大屠杀。在巴格达和柯脱两地的监狱中，警察向政治犯开火：十八位爱国志士死亡，还有一百九十二人受伤。其中有参加工会的人，也有普通工人。
    在这段时期以后，艰难的形势迫使工人阶级不得不转入地下，进行秘密的工会斗争。工人们曾试图采取一切合法形式来进行斗争，并成立了伊拉克工人高级委员会。它代表着工人们在各工厂和各工业部门成立的各种基层委员会。高级委员会的目的是：为今后的工会运动培养一个坚强的核心，在工人中提高和开展群众工作的能力，带动工人进行为争取满足他们的合法要求的斗争。委员会的责任是：用工会运动和爱国精神教育这一工人核心。
    同时，高级委员会继续努力争取获得准许成立工会的合法权利。但是得不到任何结果，因为反动政府一贯对工人们的一切合法要求抱着敌视态度。
    1956年，当英法帝国主义和以色列侵略埃及时，伊拉克人民组织了支援埃及人民的和平示威。但是帝国主义托辣斯的走狗赛义德政府向人民开了火，和平示威在全国各地都变成了人民的反抗和起义，许多爱国者被打死，工会的领导人被逮捕。但是这次的起义有力地打击了帝国主义对埃及的侵略和威胁叙利亚的阴谋。
    伊拉克的工会在这以后继续活动，出版秘密的报刊，参加了国际工会运动。伊拉克的工会代表出席大部分的国际工会会议。如两个伊拉克的工会代表出席了在来比锡召开的第四届世界工会代表大会，并且参加了莫斯科的庆祝十月革命四十周年纪念大会。
    今年7月13日的起义，一下子摧毁了帝国主义代理人的费萨尔封建王朝，这是伊拉克民族独立运动的伟大胜利，同时也是伊拉克工人运动的胜利。伊拉克工人阶级将与一切爱国力量一道，高举民族独立和自由民主的旗帜，站在反对帝国主义斗争的行列里，作出自己的贡献。
