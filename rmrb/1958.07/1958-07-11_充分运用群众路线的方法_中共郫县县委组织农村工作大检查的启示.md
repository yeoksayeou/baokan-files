    Fully Utilize the Mass Line Method
    – Inspiration from the Rural Work Inspection Organized by the CCP Pixian County Committee
    Yu Shu
    Editor's Note: The experience of Pixian County tells us that organizing a large number of cadres and the masses to assist the leadership in inspections is a good experience in applying the mass line in inspection work. Facts have proven that this is an inspection method that conforms to the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical," and it is also a method of using the advanced experiences of the masses to improve cadres and educate the masses, which is worth promoting.
    Rural socialist construction is like a thousand sails racing and ten thousand horses galloping. The Party's leadership methods must be continuously innovated to keep up with this constantly leaping situation. The large-scale rural work inspection organized by the CCP Sichuan Pixian County Committee in June is a successful example of boldly innovating leadership methods and fully applying the mass line to inspection work.
    Nearly 10,000 People Participate in the Inspection to Promote Continued Great Leap Forward in Rural Work
    The situation at the time was: the planting and growth of crops in the county were still very uneven, the conservative thinking of some township and commune cadres and the masses in technological innovation was still quite serious, and commercial work, literacy work, and health work in rural areas needed to be further promoted. "Three years to see the first year," and the first year had already passed five months. It was necessary to take agricultural production as the center and conduct a general inspection and promotion of current rural work. What to do? If the past inspection method of having the county party committee organize the secretaries of the township general branches to inspect the work of each township were still used, it would obviously not be possible to complete this task. Therefore, the county party committee decided to further develop the mass line inspection method of combining leadership and the masses, and organize a large number of grassroots cadres and the masses to assist the leadership in carrying out inspections. The fixed members of the county party committee inspection group included members of the county party committee, responsible cadres of various county-level departments, secretaries of township general branches, secretaries of branch branches, and representatives of commune members, totaling more than 400 people. Each time they went to a township, they also absorbed more than 600 people, including all cadres above the production team leader level, all Communist Party members, and Communist Youth League members of each commune in the township. In this way, the inspection team had about 1,000 members to inspect each township. More than 10,000 members participated in the inspection team successively throughout the county. It was only by relying on such a huge inspection force that the county party committee was able to grasp the central link of agricultural production and take into account various aspects such as management, leadership methods, commercial work, literacy work, and health work, and conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the county's rural areas, "visiting every commune, every team, and every field."
    This large-scale inspection was a great promotion for all rural work in the county, especially for agricultural production. In the inspection, the method of grasping both ends to bring along the middle was fully utilized. First, the more advanced townships were inspected, then the more backward townships were inspected, and finally the general townships were inspected. This allows for the timely promotion of major advanced experiences and the timely overcoming of common backward phenomena. When inspecting Xipu Township, it was found that the advanced experience of this township was that it grasped the seasons well. The inspection team immediately proposed: Spring is for days, summer is for hours, and a blitz movement to seize the season should be launched throughout the county. Some of the township and commune cadres who participated in the inspection team immediately called to arrange work, while others rushed back overnight to mobilize the masses. According to this call from the inspection team, Huayuan Township readjusted its labor force. At night, they plucked the tops of rice seedlings, sorted tobacco leaves, and made artificial manure; during the day, they cut hemp, planted tobacco, and weeded rice seedlings; they rushed for three days and nights to catch up with the season. The townships and communes that were inspected always accepted the opinions and criticisms of the inspection team with an open mind, corrected them practically, and took immediate action with remarkable results. When the inspection team found that third-class rice seedlings accounted for about 20% of all rice seedlings in Dongfeng Commune, Anjing Township, it immediately made strict criticisms to the commune and asked them to quickly apply fertilizer and carry out rescue work. The commune held an emergency meeting overnight to make arrangements, and within a few days, they worked day and night, transporting and producing more than one million catties of fertilizer. After the fertilizer was applied, the rice seedlings turned green, and the third-class fields were quickly eliminated.
    Grasp the Backward in Advanced Units, Grasp the Advanced in Backward Units
    The method of grasping both ends to bring along the middle was not only applied to the county in grasping advanced and backward townships to drive general townships, but also in inspecting each township and each commune, attention was paid to grasping the advanced and backward aspects of the township and commune. Originally, any advanced unit always has some relatively backward aspects and will not be advanced in everything; similarly, any backward unit also has some relatively advanced aspects and will not be backward in everything. This is the law of the development of things. According to this law, the county party committee inspection team paid special attention to finding relatively weak links in advanced units during the inspection process, reminding these units to prevent pride and not to relax. They also paid special attention to discovering advanced deeds in backward units, encouraging these units to boost their morale and catch up quickly. For example, Xipu Township is one of the most advanced townships in the county, with good rice planting specifications and good seedling growth, but it is very backward in terms of fully utilizing the land. Other townships mostly use field ridges to plant beans, while the field ridges in Xipu Township are still blank, which wastes 3% of the arable land. While affirming the outstanding achievements of the township's work, the inspection team also strictly pointed out this shortcoming. This prevented the township from becoming arrogant. Twenty-one commune of Yongxing Township is a relatively backward commune with poor planting specifications and many weeds in the fields. However, this commune has two innovations that other townships and communes do not have: one innovation is the early rice greenhouse seedling raising method, which is fast, land-saving, and seedling-saving; the other innovation is intercropping seven kinds of crops on one piece of land, with a minimum yield of more than 2,000 catties. While criticizing the backward phenomena of the commune, the inspection team also praised the above-mentioned innovations, which further boosted the commune's confidence in changing its backward appearance. Countless facts revealed in the inspection prove that not only do advanced townships have many achievements worth learning from by backward townships, but all backward townships also have some achievements worth learning from by other townships. For example, the intensive cultivation of Huayuan Township, the roundabout irrigation of Deyuan Township, the development of pig raising in Quan'an Township, the elimination of the seven pests in Chongxing Township, the elimination of illiteracy in Taiping Township, and the organization of reading newspapers in Qinghe Township are all ahead of other townships and are worth learning from by other townships. In this way, an atmosphere was created throughout the county in which the advanced were not arrogant, the backward were not discouraged, they learned from each other's strengths to make up for their own weaknesses, learned from each other, and leaped forward together.
    According to statistics at the end of June, after inspection and promotion, the county eliminated more than 41,000 mu of third-class seedlings, accounting for more than 98% of all third-class seedlings. The county supplemented seedlings and intercropped more than 18,000 mu, accounting for more than 90% of the total sparsely planted area. The backwardness of the 22 communes and 167 production teams that were originally relatively backward in production has changed. Other areas, such as literacy work, health work, and commercial work, have made varying degrees of progress after the inspection. By the end of June, more than 80% of the county's young and middle-aged people had escaped illiteracy. They had all mastered more than 1,500 single characters, and they had achieved four competencies: being able to recognize, write, speak, and use.
    Use the Experience of the Masses to Educate the Masses – Participating in the Inspection Team is Equivalent to a Large-Scale Rotation Training
    This large-scale inspection was also a large-scale rotation training for township and commune cadres throughout the county. Every four to five townships were inspected, and the township and commune cadres in the inspection team were rotated once. This not only ensured that there were always people leading each township and commune, but also ensured that all township and commune cadres could participate in the inspection team. They were both working and learning, helping others and improving themselves. In particular, for those commune cadres and commune member representatives who had serious conservative ideas in technological innovation, participating in the inspection was the most vivid and powerful education. Tao Qingfu, the head of the Fourteenth Commune of Huayuan Township, and Zhang Chaoyou, the head of the Thirty-first Commune, had always believed in "sparse planting for grain, dense planting for grass" in the past and opposed dense planting and insisted on sparse planting. When they discovered in Hexing Township that other people's rice seedlings were not only planted much denser than their own, but also grew better than their own, they suddenly became enlightened ideologically and immediately mobilized the commune members to make the rice seedlings denser. Zheng Hengyu, the head of the Victory Commune of Yongxing Township, said during the inspection: "Seeing the advanced experiences of others, I feel my own backwardness and conservatism. Hearing criticisms of other people's shortcomings is like hearing criticisms of myself." Therefore, many township and commune cadres call this inspection team: "On-site Rotation Training Team." Some people even said: "Participating in an inspection team once is better than staying in a training class once." Indeed, this method of using the experience of the masses to educate the masses and using vivid facts to enlighten the masses is many times more effective than training classes that are divorced from the experience of the masses and divorced from reality.
    Summarize Work Using Big-Character Posters – Inspection Effect Greatly Increased
    The mass line style of this large-scale inspection was also fully reflected in the summary of the work of each township and commune. In addition to group discussions, discussions, and general meeting reports and summaries after the on-site inspection, all inspection opinions were written into big-character posters and left to each township and commune. The method of creating these big-character posters was also "everyone inspects and everyone compiles, summarizing and writing at the same time." After the summary was completed, the big-character posters were also written. These big-character posters also generally adopted the folk song form that the broad masses love to see and hear. The language is concise, the imagery is vivid, the rhythm is smooth, and it is easy to spread. This creates a force of public opinion and greatly increases the effect of the inspection. These big-character posters contain enthusiastic praise and sharp criticism. For example, the big-character poster praising the inventions and creations of Hongguang Commune wrote: "There are thousands of ways to increase production, and the number of inventions and creations is Hongguang. The seedling on the hall is the seedling on the water, and the seedling in the air is the best for fire (best). Air seedling raising does not occupy the field, and advanced experience is spread in all directions." The big-character poster criticizing "May 1" Commune of Yongxing Township for planting rice seedlings too sparsely wrote: "'May 1' Commune, don't sleep, sleep again and you will make people laugh. The rice seedlings are planted sparsely and thinly, and the water banks (weeds in the rice fields) are full in the middle of the field. One foot at both ends is still more, and it is not difficult for Fatty Wang to sleep." The big-character poster criticizing Happiness No. 3 Commune of Xipu Township for planting rice seedlings on uneven land wrote: "The fields are full of坟包包（old burial mounds), plant seedlings wherever there are mountains and rivers. Some die of thirst on Kunlun Mountain, and some drown in the Pacific Ocean." The Twenty-seventh Commune of Qinghe Township posted the big-character poster that the inspection team criticized them for in the office. Whenever a meeting was held, they asked someone to read it once, and draw a circle on the one that was changed, and the one that was not changed would be read next time. Some commune members were embarrassed to hear it and vowed: "People live on face, trees live on bark. If you point out the shortcomings, you must change them. See the difference in the next inspection."
    Big-character posters are a powerful weapon in our country for regulating the relationships between people and promoting work. Their special role is often irreplaceable by other methods. The Pixian County Party Committee inspection team consciously used this weapon in inspecting the work, which not only helps to promote the current work, but also plays a demonstrative role in a situation where big-character posters are not yet widespread in rural areas and the masses are not yet accustomed to using big-character posters.
    The inspection, which lasted only half a month, was actually equivalent to holding multiple on-site meetings, organizing multiple exhibitions of advanced experiences, and running multiple cadre training classes. It was both a work inspection team, a general line propaganda team, an advanced experience visiting team, and a cadre rotation training team, serving multiple roles and achieving multiple benefits. The time was so short, so many things were done, and the effect was so good. This truly conforms to the spirit of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." The mass line is the fundamental line for the Party to carry out all work, and the experience of Pixian in organizing rural work inspection has once again provided vivid proof.
    Now, the cadres and the masses throughout the county are working with a hundredfold confidence to double the output of spring crops and achieve an average yield of 2,000 catties per mu!

    充分运用群众路线的方法
    ——中共郫县县委组织农村工作大检查的启示
    于蜀
    编者按：郫县的经验告诉我们，组织广大干部和广大群众协助领导上一起检查，是检查工作中运用群众路线的一个好经验。事实证明，这是一个符合“多、快、好、省”精神的检查方法，也是用群众的先进经验提高干部和教育群众的方法，值得提倡。
    农村社会主义建设，有如千帆竞发，万马奔腾，党的领导方法必须跟着这种不断跃进的形势不断革新。中共四川郫县县委会6月间组织的全县农村工作大检查，就是大胆革新领导方法、把群众路线充分运用到检查工作中来的成功的例证。
    全县近万群众参加大检查促进农村工作继续大跃进
    当时的情况是：全县作物的栽种和生长情况还很不平衡，部分乡社干部和群众在技术革新中的保守思想还相当严重，农村的商业工作、扫盲工作、卫生工作还要进一步推动，“三年看头年”，头年已经过去五个多月，必须以农业生产为中心对当前农村工作来一次总的检查和总的促进。怎么办呢？如果仍然采用过去每个月的检查方法，由县委组织各乡总支书记对每个乡的工作进行检查的话，显然不能完成这个任务。于是县委决定，进一步发展领导和群众相结合的群众路线的检查方法，组织广大基层干部和广大群众协助领导上进行检查。县委检查团的固定成员包括县委委员、县级各部门的负责干部，各乡总支书记、分支书记、各社社长和社员代表共四百多人。每到一个乡又吸收这个乡的各社生产队长以上的全体干部、全体共产党员和共青团员六百多人参加。这样检查团检查每个乡的成员就有一千人左右，全县先后参加检查团的成员在万人以上。县委就依靠这样一支巨大的检查队伍，才能既抓住农业生产这一中心环节，又兼顾经营管理、领导方法、商业工作、扫盲工作、卫生工作等各个方面，对全县农村作了“社社走到、队队走到、块块田走到”的全面深入的检查。
    这次大检查，是对全县农村各项工作特别是对农业生产的大促进。在检查中又充分运用了抓两头带中间的方法，先检查较先进的乡，再检查较落后的乡，最后检查一般的乡。这样就能及时地推广重大的先进经验，及时地克服带普遍性的落后现象。在检查犀浦乡时，总结出这个乡的一条先进经验是抓季节抓得好，检查团马上提出：春争日，夏争时，要在全县来一个抓季节的突击运动。参加检查团的各乡社干部有的立即打电话布置工作，有的星夜赶回去发动群众。花园乡根据检查团这一号召，把劳动力重新作了调整。晚上扯秧头，上烟折子，搞人造粪水；白天砍麻、下烟、薅秧；突击三昼夜，赶上了季节。被检查的乡和社，对检查团提出的意见和批评，总是虚心接受，切实改正，雷厉风行，立竿见影。检查团在安靖乡东风社发现三类秧苗约占全部秧苗的20％时，立即对这个社提出严格批评，并要他们火速追肥，进行抢救。这个社连夜召开紧急会议，作了布置，几天之内昼夜不停，运肥造肥一百多万斤。追肥一下，秧苗转青，三类田很快被消灭干净。
    在先进单位中也要抓落后  在落后单位中也要抓先进
    抓两头、带中间的方法不仅运用到全县抓先进乡和抓落后乡以带动一般乡，在检查每一个乡、每一个社的过程中也都注意抓这个乡、这个社的先进的地方和落后的地方。本来任何先进的单位，总有某些方面比较落后，不会样样全先进；同样，任何落后的单位，也总有某些方面比较先进，也不会样样都落后。这是事物发展的规律，根据这一规律，县委检查团在检查过程中，特别注意在先进单位中找出比较薄弱的环节，提醒这些单位防止骄傲，不能松劲。也特别注意在落后的单位中发现先进的事迹，鼓励这些单位鼓足干劲，急起直追。例如，犀浦乡是全县最先进的乡之一，栽秧规格好，秧苗也长得好，但在充分利用土地这方面却很落后。其他乡大都利用田坎种豆子，而犀浦乡的田坎还都是空白，这要浪费可耕土地3％。检查团在肯定这个乡工作的突出成绩的同时，也严格地指出了这个缺点。这就防止了这个乡可能产生的骄气。永兴乡二十一社是个比较落后的社，栽秧的规格差、田里的杂草多，但是，这个社却有两项其他乡社没有的创造：一个创造是早稻温室育秧法，既迅速，又省地，还省秧；另一个创造是在一块土地上间种七种庄稼，产量最少也在两千斤以上。检查团在批评这个社的落后现象的同时，也表扬了上述的创造，这就更加鼓起了这个社改变落后面貌的信心。检查出的无数事实证明，不仅先进的乡有许多成就值得后进的乡好好学习，就是所有后进的乡也都有某些成就值得其他乡学习。比如花园乡的精耕细作，德元乡的迂回灌溉，全作乡的发展生猪，崇兴乡的消灭七害，太平乡的扫除文盲，清河乡的组织读报都走在其他乡的前面，都值得其他乡学习。这样，就在全县造成一种先进的不骄，后进的不馁，取人之长，补己之短，互相学习，共同跃进的空气。
    截至6月底的统计，经过检查和促进，全县消灭三类苗四万一千多亩，占全部三类苗的98％以上。全县补秧、套种一万八千多亩，占全部稀植面积的90％以上。原来生产上比较落后的二十二个社，一百六十七个生产队的落后面貌都有了改变。其他如扫盲工作，卫生工作，商业工作在检查后都有了程度不等的进展，到6月底全县80％以上的青壮年，已脱离文盲状态，他们都已掌握了一千五百个以上的单字，而且作到了四会：会认、会写、会讲、会用。
    用群众的经验教育群众  参加检查团等于大轮训
    这次大检查，也是对全县乡社干部的大轮训。每检查四个乡到五个乡，检查团中的乡社干部就要轮换一次，这样，既保证了各乡各社经常有人领导，又保证了所有乡社干部都能参加检查团。他们既是工作，又是学习，既帮助了别人，又提高了自己。特别是对那些在革新技术方面保守思想严重的社干部和社员代表，参加检查更是一次最生动最有力的教育。花园乡十四社社长陶青福，三十一社社长张朝友，过去一直认为“稀打谷子密打草”，反对密植，坚持稀植。当他们在合兴乡发现人家的秧子不但栽得比自己的密得多，而且长得也比自己的好得多的时候，思想上豁然开朗，回去以后马上发动社员把秧苗补密了。永兴乡胜利社社长郑恒玉在参加检查的过程中说：“看到人家的先进经验，才感到自己的落后保守，听到对人家缺点的批评，就好像是对自己的批评一样。”因此，很多乡社干部都把这次检查团叫做：“现场轮训团”，有人还说：“参加一次检查团，胜住一次训练班”。的确，这种用群众的经验教育群众的方法，用活的事实启发群众的方法，比起那种脱离群众经验，脱离实际的训练班来，不知要有效多少倍。
    总结工作运用大字报  检查效果大大增加了
    这次大检查的群众路线的作风，也充分地表现在对每个乡社工作检查的总结中。这种总结除过现场检查以后分组座谈，讨论，大会汇报总结而外，还把检查的意见全部写成大字报留给各乡各社。创作这些大字报的方法也是“大家检查大家编，一边总结一边写”，总结完了，大字报也都写出来了。这些大字报又普遍采取了广大群众喜闻乐见的民歌形式，语言简明，形象生动，朗朗上口，便于传诵，这就容易造成一种舆论的力量，大大增加了检查的效果。在这些大字报中有热情的表扬，也有尖锐的批评。如表扬红光社的发明创造的大字报写道：“增产措施千万条，创造发明数红光，堂子秧来水上秧，关火（最好）要数空中秧，空中育秧不占田，先进经验传四方。”在批评永兴乡“五一”社的秧苗栽得太稀的大字报中写道：“‘五一’社别睡觉，再睡就要逗人笑。秧子栽得稀又单，水岸板（稻田中的草）长满田中间，一尺两头还多点，王胖儿睡觉不困难”。批评犀浦乡幸福三社土地高低不平就栽了秧的大字报写道：“满田都是坟包包，有山有水便栽秧，有的干死在昆仑山，有的淹死在太平洋。”清河乡二十七社把检查团批评自己的大字报贴在办公室，每当开会的时候，就叫人念一遍，那一条改了画一个圈，没有改的下次还要念。有的社员听得不好意思了，就发誓说：“人活脸，树活皮，指出缺点就要改，下次检查见高低。”
    大字报在我们国家中是调节人们之间的关系，推动工作的一种有力的武器，它的特殊作用，往往其他方法不能代替。郫县县委检查团在检查工作中有意识地运用这一武器，不仅有助于推动当前工作，而且在农村大字报还不够普遍和群众对运用大字报还不够习惯的情况下，的确还会起一种示范作用。
    时间仅仅半个多月的大检查，实际上等于举行了多次现场会议，等于组织了多次先进经验展览会，等于开办了多次干部训练班。既是工作检查团，又是总路线宣传团，又是先进经验参观团，又是干部轮训团，一身而数任，一举而数得，时间这样短，办的事这样多，效果又这样好。这真正合乎“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的精神。群众路线是党进行一切工作的根本路线，郫县组织农村工作大检查的经验，又一次作了活生生的证明。
    现在，全县干部和群众，正信心百倍地为大春作物产量翻一翻和平均亩产两千斤而努力！
