    Students as Agricultural Technicians
    Rugao Yonggan Township Agricultural Middle School Plays a Key Technical Role

    (From our newspaper) Rugao County's Yonggan Township Agricultural Middle School in Jiangsu Province is playing a key role in disseminating and promoting new agricultural technologies, initially demonstrating the superiority of agricultural middle schools.

    Since the first class on March 15th, under the leadership of the township Party committee, Yonggan Township Agricultural Middle School has closely integrated its agricultural technology, political science, language, and arithmetic classes with current agricultural production realities, powerfully promoting the enthusiasm of farmers throughout the township to learn technology. The agricultural middle school adopted a dual approach of political education and agricultural knowledge classes to disseminate new technologies. For example, when the school initially proposed that the yield target for the "practice field" should exceed the township's average of 230 jin of ginned cotton per mu, everyone was doubtful and lacked confidence. The school then systematically studied a series of technical measures for cotton, from seed treatment to cultivation, through agricultural knowledge classes, and calculated the increased production benefits of adopting the new technologies, greatly boosting the students' confidence. At the time, many commune members in the township also had doubts about the township's production leap targets. The students returned home and spread the word that implementing cotton yield-increasing measures would guarantee increased production, which aroused the interest of the commune members. Many parents and cadres voluntarily came to the school to listen to the technical classes.

    Yonggan Township Agricultural Middle School established three mu of "high-yield practice fields" on campus. Every new technical measure was first demonstrated in the "practice fields" and then promoted from the school's practice fields to the commune's practice fields, thereby popularizing it throughout the township, forming a "one-stop" system for promoting agricultural technology under the leadership of the township Party committee. Usually, whenever the students arrived at the commune teams, the members would ask them questions, ask them to teach techniques, check the moisture content of the soil, and call them "agricultural technicians of the commune."

    是学生也是农业技术员
    如皋勇敢乡农业中学发挥技术核心作用
    本报讯　江苏省如皋县勇敢乡农业中学发挥传播和推广农业新技术的核心作用，初步显示了农业中学的优越性。
    勇敢乡农业中学自3月15日建校上第一课以来，在乡党委的领导下，从农业技术课到政治、语文、算术都是密切结合当前农业生产实际进行的，有力地推动了全乡农民学习技术的积极性。农业中学采取政治课和农业知识课双管齐下的办法，传播新技术。如学校开始提出“实习田”内的产量指标要超过全乡每亩二百三十斤皮棉的指标时，人人怀疑，没有信心，学校就通过农业知识课系统地学习了棉花从种子处理到栽培中的一连串的技术措施，并算了采取新技术的增产账，使学生信心很足。当时，乡里不少社员对本乡生产跃进指标也有怀疑，学生们回家把贯彻棉花增产措施保证能增产的事传播开了，引起了社员们的兴趣，许多家长和干部都自动到学校来听技术课。
    勇敢乡农业中学在校内建立了三亩“丰产实习田”，每项新的技术措施都在“实习田”里先行示范，并从学校实习田推广到社外实习田，从而推广普及全乡，形成在乡党委领导下出现的推广农业技术的“一条龙”。平时，只要同学到了社队，社员们就要问长问短，请他们教技术，看泥料干湿，称他们为“社里的农业技术员”。
