    Eight-Year "Unsolved Case" Solved in a Day
    On the night of January 13th, 1950 (lunar calendar), a robbery occurred in the desolate Third Street of Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province. Four or five burly men suddenly broke into the home of resident Han Cheng'an. Their faces were painted with various colors, making them look terrifying. Han Cheng'an and his wife were awakened from their dreams and immediately blindfolded with towels. The bandits expertly opened chests and overturned boxes, looting Han Cheng'an's silver dollars, gold jewelry, paper money, and valuable clothing, causing him losses of more than 1,000 yuan. The next day, he reported the case to the Public Security Bureau, but because the bandits left no traces during the robbery, the police were unable to solve the case after multiple investigations.
    Eight years quickly passed. Han Cheng'an's robbery remained an "unsolved case." In April of this year, the county launched a socialist security movement, mobilizing the masses to clear up old cases. Some public security personnel doubted whether such a senseless case could be solved by the masses. Comrade Liang Guosi, who was in charge of Third Street, felt unsure even after announcing the case to the public.
    However, unexpectedly, the case became clear once it was handed over to the masses. Residents' groups held meetings for several days, and everyone brainstormed to track down clues. The masses thought of things that many public security personnel had not. Why did the bandits paint their faces during the robbery? Why did the bandits so skillfully enter Han Cheng'an's house and know exactly which box his silver dollars were in? Everyone also studied Han Cheng'an's situation. He had drunk alcohol the night he was robbed, and only a few people on the street, including Zeng Zhong, knew about it. This greatly narrowed the scope of the case. The masses were certain that the robbers were not thieves from afar but rather close neighbors on the street who were familiar with Han Cheng'an's situation. During the discussion, some suspicious clues were discovered: Zeng Zhong's wife looked panicked and went home to sleep before the meeting was over. Resident Mao Ju Po said: A few days ago, she saw Zeng Zhong's wife wearing a silver necklace that looked like something from Han Cheng'an's house, but she hadn't seen her wearing it again in the past few days.
    The masses analyzed layer by layer and tracked down step by step. Although everyone was not sure that Zeng Zhong was the robber, they believed that he was the most suspicious. Therefore, security director Liang Zhengfang and others took the initiative to educate Zeng Zhong's wife, talking about the policy of clearing up old cases and the benefits of improving public security. After several days of ideological struggle, Zeng Zhong's wife finally revealed that her husband was the culprit and persuaded him to surrender himself to the Public Security Bureau.
    In this way, the eight-year-old "unsolved case" was solved. (Chen Cen)

    八年“无头公案”  一日水落石出
    1950年农历1月13日深夜，广东省阳江县城冷僻的第三街，发生了一件抢劫案：居民韩成安的家里，突然闯进了四、五个彪形大汉，他们一个个面上涂上五颜六色，狰狞可怖。韩成安和他的妻子从梦中惊醒过来，立刻就被用手巾蒙上了眼睛。匪徒们熟练地开箱倒箧，把韩成安的银元、金饰、纸币、贵重衣物，洗劫一空。韩成安损失达一千多元。第二天，他到公安局报案，可是，由于匪徒抢劫时没有留下一点痕迹，公安人员经过多次侦察，仍未能破案。
    八年很快地过去了。韩成安被劫的事，一直还是“无头公案”。今年4月间，县里开展社会主义安全运动，发动群众清理积案。有些公安工作人员就怀疑：这样没头没脑的案件，也能叫群众来破吗？负责第三街工作的梁国赐同志，把案情向群众公布后，心里也感到没把握。
    可是，出人意料之外，案子交到群众手里就变得明朗化起来了。居民小组一连几天开会，大家动脑筋追查线索，不少公安人员想不到的事情，群众想出来了。为什么匪徒抢劫时要涂花脸呢？为什么匪徒这样熟练地进入韩成安的屋子，又这样准确地知道他的银元放在那一个箱子？大家又研究韩成安的情况，被劫的那天晚上，他刚喝过酒，而知道他喝酒的只有街上的曾忠等几人。这样，案件的范围大大缩小了。群众肯定抢劫的人不是远方的盗贼，一定是熟悉韩成安情况的街坊上的近邻。在讨论中，又发现了一些可疑的线索：居民曾忠的妻子面色惊惶，不等开完会就回家睡觉。居民毛驹婆说：前几天看见曾忠的妻子戴过一条银颈练，有点像韩成安家里的东西，可是这几天却看不见她再戴那条颈练了。
    群众一层层地分析，一步步地追查。大家虽然没有肯定曾忠是抢劫者，但是认为他的可疑最大。于是治安保卫主任梁正芳等便主动去教育曾忠的妻子，谈了清理积案的政策，又谈搞好治安的好处。曾忠妻子作了几天思想斗争，终于说出了犯罪的正是自己的丈夫，还说服丈夫到公安局自首投案。
    就这样，八年前的“无头公案”查清了。　（陈岑）
