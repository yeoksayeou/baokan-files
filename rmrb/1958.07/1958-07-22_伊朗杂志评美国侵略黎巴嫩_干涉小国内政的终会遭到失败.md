Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The "Tehran Economist" magazine published an editorial on the US armed intervention in Lebanon, saying that countries that interfere in the internal affairs of small countries will ultimately fail because the people of these interfered-with countries have awakened. They can distinguish between friends and enemies and will never concede to provocation.

The magazine said, we hope that Iranian leaders will always remember the serious situation of Iran in this turbulent region of the world, and we hope that they will have all the foresight to protect our country, which has begun on the road to economic development, from harm.

    伊朗杂志评美国侵略黎巴嫩
    干涉小国内政的终会遭到失败
    据新华社讯  “德黑兰经济学家”杂志就美国武装干涉黎巴嫩这件事发表社论说，那些干涉小国内政的国家终会遭到失败，因为这些被干涉的国家的人民已经觉醒了。他们能够分清敌友，决不会对挑衅让步。
    杂志说，我们希望伊朗领导人时刻记住伊朗在世界这个动荡不安的地区中所处的严重情况，并且希望他们具有一切远见地保护开始走上经济发展道路的我国免受危害。
