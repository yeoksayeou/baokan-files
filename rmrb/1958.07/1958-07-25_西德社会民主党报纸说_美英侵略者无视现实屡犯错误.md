Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, July 22nd (TASS): The West German "Social Democratic Press Bulletin" condemned the US-British aggression in the Middle East, saying that "neither politically nor morally can the actions of the United States and Britain in the Middle East be considered justified."

    The newspaper believes that the obvious consequences of the US-British aggression are: the increasing sharpening of the international situation; the creation of an almost insurmountable distrust of the West in the Arab world; the increasing isolation of the US and the UK in the United Nations; and the confusion shown by London and Washington in their views on the future development of events. The newspaper pointed out that the United States and Britain "have from the beginning pursued a policy that disregards the realities of our time, and therefore repeatedly make mistakes."

    The bulletin believes that since the US-British armed intervention in the Middle East, the prestige of the Soviet Union has been constantly increasing. "The Soviet Union's right to participate in discussions of world affairs is more indisputable today than ever before." It called on Western countries to listen to the Soviet Union's call and accept the Soviet proposal for a rapid summit meeting to resolve the Middle East crisis.

    In addition, according to a report by the West German "German News Agency," the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the West German Social Democratic Party stated on the 21st that it supported the Soviet proposal to convene a summit conference of various governments to discuss the Middle East issue.

    西德社会民主党报纸说
    美英侵略者无视现实屡犯错误
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社波恩22日讯：西德“社会民主党新闻公报”谴责美英对中近东的侵略说，“无论从政治上或道义上来说，美英在中近东的行动都不能被认为是正当的。”
    报纸认为，美英这次侵略行动的明显后果是：国际局势日益尖锐化；阿拉伯世界对西方产生了几乎难以消除的不信任情绪；美、英两国在联合国组织中日益陷于孤立以及伦敦和华盛顿对事件今后发展的看法上所表现的混乱。报纸指出，美英两国“从一开头就执行了无视我们时代现实因素的政策，因此接二连三地犯错误”。
    公报认为，自从美英武装干涉中东的事件发生后，苏联的威信有了不断的提高。“苏联参与讨论世界事务问题的权利今天比以往任何时候都更不容置疑了。”它呼吁西方国家倾听苏联的呼声，并且接受苏联关于迅速举行政府首脑会议解决中近东危机的建议。
    另外据西德“德意志新闻社”报道，西德社会民主党执行委员会主席团21日表示支持苏联关于召开各国政府首脑会议来讨论中近东问题的建议。
