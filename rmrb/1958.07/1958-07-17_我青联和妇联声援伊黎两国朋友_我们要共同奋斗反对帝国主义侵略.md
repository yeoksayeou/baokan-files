Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The All-China Youth Federation today sent a telegram to the youth friends of Iraq and Lebanon, strongly protesting against the US imperialist aggression against Lebanon, and expressing support for the Iraqi revolutionary government.
    In a telegram addressed to the youth friends of Iraq and Lebanon, which the All-China Youth Federation requested the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council to forward, it said that Chinese youth are closely watching the heroic struggle of the Lebanese people against imperialism with the greatest concern, and celebrating the great victory of the Iraqi people. The telegram stated: "The extremely vicious imperialist aggressor group is now at the end of its road, a setting sun. It appears powerful, but in reality, it is just a paper tiger. Chinese youth firmly believe that as long as you strengthen your unity and persist in your struggle, you will surely achieve a complete victory. Justice belongs to you. The people of the world are on your side!"
    "Dear friends, the Chinese people and youth, who have long suffered from imperialist oppression and aggression, will always be your loyal friends. We firmly stand with the people of Iraq and Lebanon who are striving for independence and freedom, and will work together to completely crush all imperialist aggressive conspiracies."
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The person in charge of the All-China Women's Federation issued a statement today, supporting the revolutionary struggle of the Iraqi people and demanding that the American aggressors get out of Lebanon.
    The person in charge of the All-China Women's Federation said:
    "The struggle of the Lebanese and Iraqi people against the reactionary rule of their own countries is just and is the internal affair of the two countries. No one has any reason to interfere. However, US imperialism, disregarding the opposition of the people of the Middle East and the world, is brazenly carrying out armed intervention. This not only fully exposes its wolfish face and naked aggressive ambition, but also seriously threatens the safety of the people of the Middle East and world peace.
    "The Chinese people and women resolutely support the struggle of the Iraqi and Lebanese people for independence and freedom. We believe that the heroic Iraqi and Lebanese people will not be intimidated. The American aggressors will suffer the same shameful fate as the British and French imperialists in the Suez Canal incident! The awakened Arab people, with the sympathy and support of the people of the world, will surely be able to defeat any imperialist conspiracies and direct interventions!"

    我青联和妇联声援伊黎两国朋友
    我们要共同奋斗反对帝国主义侵略
    新华社16日讯　中华全国青年联合会今天致电伊拉克和黎巴嫩的青年朋友，坚决抗议美帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩，并且表示支持伊拉克革命政府。
    全国青联在请亚非人民团结理事会书记处转交给伊拉克和黎巴嫩青年朋友的一份电报中说，中国青年以最大的关怀密切注视着黎巴嫩人民反抗帝国主义的英勇斗争，并且欢呼伊拉克人民的伟大胜利。电报说：“穷凶极恶的帝国主义侵略集团今天已经是穷途末路，日落西山，它貌似强大，实际上只不过是一只纸老虎，中国青年深信只要你们加强团结，坚持斗争，你们一定会取得彻底的胜利。正义是属于你们的。全世界人民是站在你们一边的！
    “亲爱的朋友们，曾经长期遭受帝国主义压迫和侵略过的中国人民和青年永远是你们忠实的朋友，我们坚决和争取独立自由的伊拉克和黎巴嫩人民站在一起，为彻底粉碎帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋而共同奋斗。”
    新华社16日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会负责人今天发表谈话，支持伊拉克人民的革命斗争，并且要求美国侵略者从黎巴嫩滚出去。
    全国妇联负责人说：
    “黎巴嫩和伊拉克人民反对本国反动统治的斗争是正义的，是两国人民的内政，任何人没有理由加以干涉，而美帝国主义竟不顾中东和世界人民的反对，蛮横地进行武装干涉，这不但充分地暴露了它的豺狼面貌和赤裸裸的侵略野心，而且严重地威胁着中东人民的安全与世界和平。
    “中国人民和妇女坚决支持伊拉克、黎巴嫩人民争取独立和自由的斗争。我们相信英勇的伊拉克、黎巴嫩人民是吓不倒的，美国侵略者必将遭到英法帝国主义在苏伊士运河事件中一样的可耻的下场！觉醒了的阿拉伯人民在全世界人民的同情和支持下，一定能够战胜帝国主义的任何阴谋诡计和直接干涉！”
