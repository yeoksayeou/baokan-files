    Haira and His Donkey
    —A Lebanese Folktale
    Aimier Yusuofu Awade
    The news spread throughout the entire village: A gentleman's car had injured Haira the vegetable vendor's donkey! As soon as Haira's wife heard the news, she burst into loud wails, disturbing the residents of the entire village, who immediately rushed to the scene of the accident.

    In the village, who didn't know Haira the vegetable vendor? Every morning, he walked through every corner of the village, stopping at each house, calling out to the mistress of the house, and introducing her to his fresh vegetables.

      "Mrs. Nu'er, I've brought you cucumbers, tomatoes, pumpkins, and lentils."

    If Mrs. Nu'er was prepared to buy something, he would say to his donkey:

    "Stand still, little brother. See how much everyone respects your master. He speaks kindly, he likes to be honest, and all his goods are top-notch."

    When Haira addressed his donkey as brother, everyone in the village laughed at him. But why shouldn't he call his donkey that? This donkey was a loyal friend who shared weal and woe with the vegetable vendor. When there was no oats, how many times did the donkey obediently chew on dry grass; how many times was Haira forced to go without giving it water for hours on end. In fact, wasn't this donkey Haira's faithful companion and friend?

    Haira often said to the donkey:

    "Little brother, neither my wife nor I dream of getting rich. I just want us to have bread to eat every day, a house to live in, and all the daily necessities. I'm not one of those people who dreams of having gorgeous furniture and silks, dreams of living in palaces and bossing around servants. My little brother, I'm just a frugal vegetable vendor, and I'm willing to be a vegetable vendor for the rest of my life."

    On that unlucky day, as Haira was taking his tired donkey home as usual after completing a day's journey, a car suddenly rushed out from around the corner and knocked the donkey down. Before Haira could figure out what had happened, a large crowd of people had gathered around him.

    The car stopped. A tall man, holding a silver-inlaid cane, got out of the car. He stood by the side of the road, casting a hateful glance at the people surrounding him.

    "Ah, my little brother! Ah, my benefactor! How could they treat Haira's friend like this? Is this my retribution? Ah, look, condemn poor Haira, curse this vegetable vendor, because he has nothing but a donkey, but he can't even protect his donkey!" Haira cried out loudly.

    The donkey lay on the dusty road, and Haira and his wife sat beside the donkey, crying loudly and trying their best to alleviate the donkey's pain.

    The car owner nonchalantly took out a cigar, smoked it, asked who this Haira was, and then walked back to his car.

    After the car drove away, the village chief tried to calm everyone down, saying:

    "Hey, don't worry. This is a wealthy gentleman. He will definitely compensate Haira enough to buy three or even four donkeys."

    Everyone carefully carried the donkey onto a large cart and took it to Haira's home. After the veterinarian examined it, he found that the donkey had a broken leg and a severely bruised waist. At night, the donkey cried loudly, and could be heard clearly even at the other end of the village.

    Two weeks passed. The gentleman did not think of Haira's matter. The village chief fruitlessly consulted the mayor and the municipal committee members, and fruitlessly consulted the lawyers in the city about whether he could appeal for compensation for the donkey's disability.

    The lawyers did not advocate for filing a lawsuit, because Haira was certain to lose. "The law cannot control the rich." In fact, would a person holding a knife stab himself?

    But the village chief insisted on his opinion and filed a lawsuit. The court made a judgment, sentencing the vegetable vendor to a fine and detention for a week! It was said that it was because his donkey had obstructed the gentleman's path and delayed a meeting to resolve issues related to "social welfare"...

    The residents of the village were outraged when they heard the news. Many villagers went to Haira's place, willing to give him help. But what could they do? Haira was locked up in prison for seven days. (Attached image)

    哈依拉和他的驴子
    ——黎巴嫩民间故事
    艾弥尔·尤苏福·阿瓦德
    这件新闻传遍了整个村子：一位老爷的汽车压伤了菜贩哈依拉的驴子！哈依拉的妻子一听到这个消息就嚎陶大哭起来，惊动了全村的居民，大家马上跑到肇事地点去。
    在村子里谁不知道哈依拉这个菜贩子，他每天早晨走遍全村每个角落，在每家门口停下来，唤出女主人，向她介绍新鲜的蔬菜。
      “努尔太太，我给您带来了黄瓜、番茄、南瓜、扁豆。”
    假使努尔太太准备买点什么，他就对自己的驴子说：
    “站住吧，小兄弟。你瞧大家多么尊敬你的主人。他说话和气，他喜欢老老实实，他的所有货物都是上等的。”
    当哈依拉称呼自己的驴子为兄弟的时候，村子里所有的人都嘲笑他。但是为什么他不应这样称呼自己的驴子呢？这头驴子是和菜贩同甘苦的忠实朋友呀。当没有燕麦的时候，驴子驯顺地嚼过多少次干草；哈依拉有多少次迫不得已一连几小时不给它饮水。事实上，难道这头驴子不是哈依拉的忠实伴侣和朋友吗？
    哈依拉常常对驴子说：
    “小兄弟，我和我的妻子都不梦想发财。我只要我们每天有面包吃、有房子住，有一切日用必需的东西就行了。我不是那些梦想着有华丽家具和绫罗绸缎，梦想着住宫殿和使唤奴仆的人。我的小兄弟，我只是一个俭朴的菜贩，我愿意当一辈子菜贩。”
    在那倒霉的一天，哈依拉带着他那头疲惫的驴子照例走完一天的旅程回家去的时候，突然从拐角处冲出一辆汽车，撞倒了驴子。还没等哈依拉弄明白究竟发生了什么事情，他的周围就聚集了一大堆人。
    汽车停下来了。一个身材高大的人，手里拿着镶银小手杖，走下汽车。他站在路边，用充满憎恶的眼光向围着的人们扫视一周。
    “啊，我的小兄弟！啊，我的恩人！他们怎么这样对待哈依拉的朋友呢？这是我的报应吗？啊，你们瞧吧，谴责穷苦的哈依拉吧，诅咒这个菜贩吧，因为他除了驴子以外一无所有，可是他却不会保护自己的驴子！”哈依拉高声哭诉着。
    驴子躺在尘土飞扬的道路上，哈依拉同他的妻子坐在驴子旁边，放声大哭，并且极力设法减轻驴子的痛苦。
    汽车的主人若无其事地掏出一支雪茄烟吸着，问了问这个哈依拉是什么人之后，就向汽车走去。
    汽车开走了以后，村长力图使人们安静下来，他说：
    “嗳，不要着急。这是一位财主老爷。他一定会赔给哈依拉足够买三头甚至四头驴子的钱的。”
    大家小心地把驴子抬上大车，送到哈依拉的家里。兽医检查以后，发现驴腿折断了一只，腰部撞伤得很厉害。夜里，驴子大声号叫着，连村子的另一头都听得清清楚楚。
    两个星期过去了。老爷并没有想起哈依拉的事情。村长白白地向市长和市政委员们请示了一趟，白白地找城里的律师商量能否上诉请求赔偿驴子残废损失的问题。
    律师们都不主张去控告，因为哈依拉肯定是要败诉的。“法律管不了富人。”事实上，难道一个手里拿着刀的人会刺伤自己吗？
    但是村长坚持自己的意见，提起了控诉。法庭作出了判决，判处菜贩一笔罚金和拘留一星期！据说是因为他的驴子阻碍了老爷的路而耽误了一次解决有关“社会福利”问题的会晤……
    村里的居民听到这个消息后都愤怒起来了。许多村民都到哈依拉那里去，愿意给他帮助。但是他们又有什么办法呢？哈依拉在监狱里关了七天。（附图片）
