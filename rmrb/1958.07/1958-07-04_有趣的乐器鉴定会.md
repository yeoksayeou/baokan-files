An Interesting Musical Instrument Appraisal Meeting

(Reported by our newspaper) Recently, Tianjin held a very interesting on-site musical instrument appraisal meeting.

Xia Zhizhi, professor of the Central Conservatory of Music, played the first part of "Chopin's Etude in E Major" on the three-tone trumpet being appraised on the spot and was very satisfied. He said: The most important sign of measuring musical instruments - intonation - has reached a very high level; at the same time, the dexterity of the pistons is very good, and the fingers naturally open and close with a light touch. Because the violin's materials are appropriately selected, the varnish is properly applied, and the workmanship is exquisite, the sound is quite uniform. When the four strings are switched, there is no sudden change; sometimes clear and sometimes deep, almost approaching the human voice. Musicians also appraised accordions and other instruments and unanimously agreed that these domestically produced Western-style instruments fully possess the level required by performers.

    有趣的乐器鉴定会
    本报讯　最近天津市举行了一个饶有风趣的乐器现场鉴定会。
    中央音乐学院教授夏之秋，当场用被鉴定的三音小号演奏了“萧邦E大调钢琴练习曲”的第一段，感到非常满意。他说：衡量乐器的一个最重要的标志——音准，已经达到了很高的水平；同时，活塞的灵巧度很好，手指轻轻一触就自然开关了。由于小提琴选材适当、涂漆得法、做工精细，因而发声相当均匀，当四弦转换的时候，毫无突然的变异，时而清亮时而沉浊，几乎接近人声。音乐工作者们对手风琴等乐器也进行了鉴定，一致认为，这些国产的西式乐器已经完全具备了演奏家们所需要的水平。
