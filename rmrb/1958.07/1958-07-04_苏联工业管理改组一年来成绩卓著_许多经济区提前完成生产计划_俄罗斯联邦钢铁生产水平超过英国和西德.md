Moscow Dispatch, July 3rd – Under the new management system, Soviet industry and construction have achieved tremendous successes in the past year. Many economic zones have completed their production plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. For example, the Gorky Economic Zone completed its production tasks for the first half of the year on June 21st, and enterprises in Moscow and Leningrad completed their production tasks for the first half of the year on June 24th. Production in the Bashkir oil region increased by 13.1% in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. Many leading cadres of the National Economic Council said that the reorganization implemented by the Soviet Union in the management of industry and construction has achieved remarkable results in the past year, providing a strong guarantee for the further high tide of the national economy.

"Pravda," in an editorial commemorating the first anniversary of industrial reorganization, said, "The historical experience of socialist and communist construction in the Soviet Union and all countries of the socialist camp has overturned the delusions of modern revisionists, who unreasonably curse one of the most important functions of socialist countries - the function of managing the national economy."

The new management form of Soviet industry and construction not only accelerated the completion of production plans but also greatly increased the enthusiasm of workers in various enterprises. Many workers actively put forward rationalization proposals. Petrov, Chairman of the Moscow City National Economic Council, said that in the first quarter of 1958 alone, more than 22,500 rationalization proposals were adopted in Moscow's factories, many of which accelerated the automation and mechanization of production.

After the reorganization of industry and construction, economic and technical committees and regular production meetings were established in all major factories. Through these organizations, the democratic management of enterprises was strengthened.

In commemoration of the first anniversary of the reorganization of industrial and construction management, preliminary summaries of the work of the past year have been made in various places. Many leading cadres of the National Economic Council said that they will continue to use the advantages of the new management form, give play to the enthusiasm of workers, tap production potential, and complete the new tasks of industry and construction more quickly.

Moscow Dispatch, July 3rd – The steel industry in the Russian Federation is booming, and its proportion in the entire Soviet steel industry is also increasing. At present, according to the level of steel production, the Russian Federation has long surpassed Britain and West Germany. Belov, Director of the Ferrous Metallurgy Department of the Russian Federation State Planning Commission, said that in the next seven years, the steel industry in the Russian Federation will be further developed. Twenty new blast furnaces, thirty-seven new open-hearth furnaces, and thirty-five rolling mills will be built here. The output of steel and rolled steel will increase by 72% in seven years. In addition to the continued development of the West Siberian and Magnitogorsk iron and steel complexes, new iron and steel complexes will be built in Orsk and Lipetsk, among other places. The Lipetsk iron and steel complex will be the largest in the entire Soviet Union.

    苏联工业管理改组一年来成绩卓著
    许多经济区提前完成生产计划
    俄罗斯联邦钢铁生产水平超过英国和西德
    本报莫斯科3日电　苏联的工业和建筑业在新的管理形式下，一年来取得了巨大的成绩，许多经济区都提前完成了上半年的生产计划。例如：高尔基经济区在6月21日就完成了上半年的生产任务，莫斯科和列宁格勒的企业在6月24日把今年前半年的生产任务完成了。巴什基尔石油区的生产，今年前半年比去年同一时期提高了13.1％。许多国民经济委员会的负责干部都说，苏联在工业和建筑业管理方面实行的改组，一年来取得了显著成绩，它为国民经济的进一步高涨提供了有力的保证。
    “真理报”在纪念工业改组一周年的社论里说，“苏联以及社会主义阵营所有国家社会主义和共产主义建设的历史经验，推翻了现代修正主义者的臆想，这些修正主义者无理地咒骂社会主义国家的一项最重要的作用——管理国家国民经济的作用。”
    苏联工业和建筑业的新管理形式不但加速了生产计划的完成，并且大大提高了各企业工人的积极性，许多工人都积极提出合理化建议。莫斯科市国民经济委员会主席彼特罗夫说，仅在1958年第一季度，在莫斯科的各工厂中，就采用了二万二千五百多条合理化建议，其中有很多是加速生产的自动化和机械化的。
    工业和建筑业改组以后，在所有大工厂都成立了经济技术委员会和经常性的生产会议。通过这些组织，加强了企业的民主管理。
    在纪念工业和建筑业管理的改组一周年时，各地初步总结了一年来的工作。许多国民经济委员会的负责人都说，他们将继续利用新管理形式的优越性，发挥工人的积极性，发掘生产潜力，更快地完成工业和建筑业的新任务。
    本报莫斯科3日电　俄罗斯联邦的钢铁工业正在蓬勃发展，它在整个苏联钢铁工业中的比重，也日益提高。目前按照钢铁的生产水平，俄罗斯联邦早已超过了英国和西德。俄罗斯联邦国家计划委员会黑色冶金部主任别洛说，在今后七年中，俄罗斯联邦的钢铁工业将获得进一步发展，这里将建设二十座新高炉，三十七座新平炉，三十五座轧钢机。钢和轧钢的产量在七年中将提高72％。除去西西伯利亚和马格尼托格尔斯克的钢铁联合工厂要继续发展外，新的钢铁联合工厂将在奥尔斯克和利比茨克等地兴建，利比茨克的钢铁联合工厂将是全苏最大的一个。
