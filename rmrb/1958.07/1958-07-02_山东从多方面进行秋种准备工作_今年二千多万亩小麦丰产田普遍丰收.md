 Shandong Prepares for Autumn Planting from Multiple Perspectives

 This Year Over 20 Million Mu of High-Yield Wheat Fields Achieve Universal Bumper Harvest

 (Our Newspaper) It is imperative to start now and immediately launch a province-wide mass campaign to strive for a high-speed leap forward in wheat production next year. This is the point that the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently emphasized when arranging the current agricultural production. The Provincial Committee believes that achieving a great leap forward in wheat, which has always been denigrated as a low-yield crop, is the primary key to realizing the province's total grain output plan for next year.

 After conducting an in-depth analysis of various conditions and factors, the Provincial Committee pointed out that there is a sufficient basis for achieving a high-speed leap forward in wheat in Shandong Province. The current main task is for leaders at all levels to truly unify their thinking and understanding, be full of energy, and, through wheat high-yield competitions, especially through mass debates, rapidly transform the idea that "wheat can leap forward, and it inevitably will" into a social consensus throughout the province, leaving no room for conservatives and skeptics to raise their heads.

 Based on the universal experience of high wheat yields in various places, the Provincial Committee believes that in order to achieve a major leap forward in wheat production next year, this year's autumn planting work must meet the standardized requirements of specialized agriculture: (1) Taking the commune as a unit, follow the Provincial Committee's requirement to ensure that an average of 25 to 30 jin of high-quality seeds are reserved per mu. All those who have not reserved enough or well enough must adjust by mid-September.
  (2) Do everything possible to prepare a large quantity of high-quality base fertilizer for autumn planting. It is required that general wheat fields apply 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and high-yield fields apply 40,000 to 50,000 jin. (3) All wheat fields in the province are required to be deeply ploughed to a depth of seven inches or more this year. (4) Universally reform dense planting drills and train drill operators.
 
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 30th - Shandong Province's 21 million mu of high-yield wheat fields have had good harvests. According to preliminary reports from various places, over 17 million mu have yields of over 200 jin per mu, accounting for 81.8% of the total area of high-yield fields. Among them, more than 6.6 million mu have yields of 300 to 800 jin per mu, and more than 117,000 mu have yields of 800 to over 1,000 jin; a few high-yield fields have even created records of over 3,000 jin per mu. Due to the universal bumper harvest in high-yield fields, Shandong's total wheat output this year has greatly exceeded the original planned target of 7 billion jin.

    山东从多方面进行秋种准备工作
    今年二千多万亩小麦丰产田普遍丰收
    本报讯　必须从现在开始，立即在全省掀起一个全民性的力争明年小麦产量高速跃进的热潮。这是中共山东省委最近在安排当前的农业生产时突出强调的一点。省委认为，把一向被人们贬称为低产作物的小麦，先来一个大跃进，是实现明年全省粮食总产量计划的首要关键。
    省委对于各种条件和因素进行了深入的分析以后指出，在山东省实现小麦高速跃进是有充分根据的，当前的主要任务，在于各级领导真正统一思想认识，鼓足干劲，通过小麦丰产评比，特别是通过全民大辩论，把“小麦可以跃进，而且必然跃进”的思想迅速在全省形成一种社会舆论，让一切保守主义者和怀疑派抬不起头来。
    根据各地小麦丰产的普遍性经验，省委认为要使明年小麦产量大跃进，今年的秋种工作必须达到规格农业准标化：（一）以社为单位，按照省委提出的保证平均每亩留足良种二十五斤至三十斤的要求。凡没有留足留好的，一律于9月半以前调好。
  （二）要想尽一切办法为秋种准备下量多质好的基肥。要求一般麦田亩施基肥两万斤，丰产田施四、五万斤。（三）全省所有麦田今年要求普遍深耕七寸以上。（四）普遍改制密植耧，训练扶耧手。
                                                 （康宁）
    据新华社济南30日电　山东省两千一百多万亩小麦丰产田收成良好。据各地预报，每亩产量在二百斤以上的有一千七百多万亩，占丰产田总面积的81.8％。其中亩产三百斤至八百斤的有六百六十多万亩，八百斤到一千斤以上的有十一万七千多亩；少数丰产田并且创造了亩产三千多斤的纪录。由于丰产田普遍丰收，今年山东小麦总产量大大超过了原定七十亿斤的计划要求。
