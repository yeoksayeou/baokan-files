    Waste Finds a Way Out
    Comrades in the Office of the Chunhu District Committee of the Yongxiu County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jiangxi Province, successfully used waste carbon paper to write stencils instead of stencil paper, saving the country funds and raw materials. The office needs 80 sheets of stencil paper per month. If each sheet costs 6.3 fen, it can save 5 yuan. If the whole country does this, it can not only save a lot of money, but also transfer the raw materials for making stencil paper to other uses.
    The method of using waste carbon paper is the same as that of stencil paper, but carbon paper is fragile and easy to break, while stencil paper is more flexible. Therefore, you need to use a slightly lighter force when writing, and the tip of the pen should not be too sharp.

    废品找到了出路
    中共江西省永修县淳湖区委会办公室的同志，利用废复写纸代替蜡纸试写钢板成功，给国家节约了资金和原料。该办公室每月需用八十张蜡纸，若以每张六分三计算，就可节约五元，如果全国都这样作，不仅可节约大量资金，还可将制蜡纸原料移作他用。
    使用废复写纸的方法与蜡纸相同，只是复写纸有碎性易破，蜡纸的韧性较强，因此写时须用力稍轻，笔尖不宜太尖。
