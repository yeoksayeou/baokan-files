Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 30th. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, linking the two major new industrial zones of Northwest and North China, has been fully completed today, five months ahead of the original schedule. A grand celebration of the joining of the tracks and the opening of the railway will be held in Yinchuan on August 1st. The Lanzhou-Yinchuan section of the railway will begin passenger and freight through transport with the national railway network.

At 5:00 PM today, at the joining point on the southern end of Yinchuan Station on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, the massive track-laying machine laid the final section of rail amidst firecrackers and drums. Immediately, a storm of applause and cheers erupted from the crowd.

The ribbon-draped and decorated track-laying train sounded a long whistle to announce the good news, then slowly passed through the joining point and entered the station. At this moment, drums and firecrackers resounded in unison at the station, as the track-laying heroes from the southern and northern sections met here, shouting to learn from each other. The railway construction heroes and people from all ethnic groups in Yinchuan reveled together to their hearts' content.

Gan Chunlei, Secretary of the Ningxia Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Major General He Huiyan, leader of a certain unit of the Railway Corps, and Feng Mao, Secretary of the Yinchuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, traveled twenty *li* outside the city to welcome them. After receiving the good news from the railway construction workers, Gan Chunlei extended warm greetings to the railway construction heroes on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region. Many Hui and Han people brought the melons and fruits they had grown and came from the suburbs early in the morning to wait at the station to express their gratitude to the railway construction heroes.

The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, with a total length of 1,000 kilometers, connects with the Beijing-Baotou Railway and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, making this second major transportation artery to the Northwest capable of supplementing the insufficient transport capacity of the western section of the Longhai Railway and ensuring the transport of materials for large-scale construction in the Northwest region. "The Jiangnan of the Borderlands," Ningxia, will no longer rely on automobiles, leather rafts, and camels to transport its local specialties. From Yinchuan, the capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, it will only take two days by train to reach the capital of the motherland, Beijing.

Construction on this railway began in 1954 and 1955 by the employees of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, starting from Lanzhou and Baotou respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 29th. The construction of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway has received strong support from the Hui, Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Gansu, and other provinces and regions.

Farmers in the Hetao area of ​​the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, together with the railway construction troops, carried out extensive canal modification projects in the irrigated areas through which the railway passed, re-routing the four major canals and hundreds of smaller canals to facilitate the railway's passage. Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous County in Gansu Province organized a team of hundreds of Hui laborers, who worked side-by-side with the railway workers for more than a year, helping to open the Gujia Gou Tunnel, which is more than 1,000 meters long. When the railway crossed the Tengger Desert, the Hui and Han people of Zhongwei County, Ningxia, helped the workers build dozens of *li* of sandbreaks on both sides of the desert subgrade. Commercial, banking, postal, telecommunications, bookstores, and other departments in various places organized mobile groups to serve the troops and workers along with the construction army. Many farmers along the line vacated their houses for the troops to live in. To ensure the timely transportation of railway construction materials, a large number of transportation forces were organized in various places along the line. People in Lanzhou, Gaolan, and other places in Gansu Province used horse-drawn carts to transport water from dozens of *li* away to solve the drinking water problem for railway construction workers in arid mountainous areas.

    贯通西北和华北的主要干线
    包兰铁路全线修通
    新华社银川30日电　联结西北和华北两大新工业区的包兰铁路，已经比原计划时间提前五个月在今天全线修通。8月1日将在银川举行盛大的接轨通车庆祝大会。兰州、银川段铁路将开办和全国铁路的客货联运。
    今天下午五时在包兰铁路银川车站南端的接轨点上，巨大的铺轨机在鞭炮和锣鼓声中铺下了最后一段钢轨，顿时人群中爆发出暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声。
    披绸扎彩的铺轨列车一声长鸣向人们表示报喜，然后徐徐通过接轨点，驶进车站。这时车站上锣鼓鞭炮齐鸣，来自南段和北段的两路铺路英雄在这里会师，互相高呼向对方学习。筑路英雄们并和银川各族各界人民在一起尽情狂欢。
    中共宁夏工委书记甘春雷、铁道兵部队某部首长何辉燕少将和中共银川市委书记冯茂等，都出城二十里前来欢迎。甘春雷在接受筑路职工的喜报后，代表自治区各族人民向筑路英雄们致以热烈的慰问。许多回汉人民带着种植的瓜果，一早就从市郊赶来等候在车站上慰问筑路英雄。
    全长一千公里的包兰铁路与京包铁路和兰新铁路连接，使这通往西北的第二条交通大动脉，可以弥补陇海铁路西段运输能力的不足，保证西北地区大规模建设的物资运输。“塞上江南”的宁夏不再依靠汽车、牛皮筏和骆驼来运出土特产了。从宁夏回族自治区的首府——银川坐上火车只有两日行程就可以到达祖国的首都北京。
    这条铁路是从1954年和1955年由铁道部第一工程局职工分别从兰州和包头开始施工的。
    据新华社银川29日电　包兰铁路的建设得到内蒙古、宁夏、甘肃等省区的回、蒙古、汉等各族人民的大力支援。
    内蒙古自治区河套地区的农民，和铁道兵筑路部队一起，在铁路经过的灌溉区，进行了浩繁的改渠工程，把四大干渠和数百条小渠重行改道，使铁路便于通过。甘肃省张家川回族自治县，组织了一个数百人的回民民工队伍，和筑路工人并肩工作了一年多，帮助打通了长达一千多公尺的顾家沟隧道。铁路穿越腾格里大沙漠时，宁夏中卫县回、汉族人民在沙漠路基两旁，帮助工人营造了数十里防沙栏。各地商业、银行、邮电、书店等部门都组织了流动组，随筑路大军为部队、职工服务。沿线有很多农民把自己的房屋腾出来让给部队住。为了保证及时运输筑路器材和物资，沿线各地还组织了大批运输力量。甘肃省兰州、皋兰等地人民曾用马车从几十里路外给筑路职工运水，解决在干旱山区修建铁路职工的喝水问题。
