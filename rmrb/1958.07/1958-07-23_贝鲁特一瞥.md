    A Glimpse of Beirut
    Zhang Tiesheng

    We flew from Cairo to Beirut on the evening of November 14th last year. We stayed in Beirut for more than half a month.

    Lebanon can be considered a mountainous country. Except for a small plain in the east, the entire territory is mountainous; Beirut is also built on hills. As long as you look out from Mount Lebanon (in eastern Lebanon), you can see that large and small mountains are scattered about, occupying almost the entire country. Beirut, protruding on the Mediterranean coast like a small hill on a peninsula.

    Beirut has a population of about 500,000. After we arrived, we would sometimes stroll through the streets and alleys to see the real face of Beirut. The Lebanese people are amiable and approachable. When they encounter us, a few yellow-faced Chinese, they not only don't feel strange but also express welcome, greeting us, asking about our well-being, and being as warm as old friends. At the same time, there is a tacit understanding between us: as soon as we see the arrogant Americans, we and they shake our heads, glare, and sneer. In fact, apart from those arrogant American "residents," there are also many reckless U.S. Marines in Beirut. Beirut leans against Mount Lebanon in the east and faces the Mediterranean Sea in the west. Part of the U.S. Sixth Fleet often patrols the waters west of Beirut as if no one else is there, flaunting the might of imperialism. The Marines also often land in Beirut to drink and insult women, so the people of Beirut avoid them like the plague. Sometimes they test new weapons near Beirut (Beirut has become a de facto military base in their eyes). They rampage through the streets of Beirut, making many Lebanese glare at them.

    When we left Beirut again by plane for Tunis on December 4th last year, I looked down from the plane at the Mediterranean Sea, "crashing rocks break through the clouds, startling waves split the shore, rolling up thousands of piles of snow," and wished from afar that the anti-American sentiment of the Lebanese people would one day, like the turbulent Mediterranean Sea, break through the "shore" built by American imperialism.

### 贝鲁特一瞥

    贝鲁特一瞥
    张铁生
    去年11月14日晚间，我们从开罗飞到贝鲁特。在贝鲁特停留了半个多月。
    黎巴嫩可算是一个山国。它除去东部的一小块平原外，全境都是山；贝鲁特也是建筑在丘陵上面的。只要你在黎巴嫩山（在黎巴嫩东部）上举目一望，就可以看出：大山小山，错错落落，差不多把整个黎巴嫩都盘据了，而突出在地中海滨，犹如半岛的一个小丘，便是贝鲁特。
    贝鲁特的人口约有五十万，当我们到了贝鲁特以后，有时曾在街头巷尾蹓跶蹓跶，借此来看看贝鲁特的真面目。黎巴嫩人民是和蔼可亲的，他们碰到我们几副黄面孔的中国人不但不觉得陌生，而且表示欢迎，同我们打招呼，向我们问长问短，亲热得好像熟朋友一般。同时我们和他们之间还有一种情绪是不约而同的，只要一看见那趾高气扬的美国人，我们和他们都摇摇头、瞪瞪眼而嗤之以鼻。事实上，除去那趾高气扬的美国“侨民”而外，在贝鲁特还有不少横冲直撞的美国海军陆战队。贝鲁特东倚黎巴嫩山，西滨地中海，美国第六舰队的一部分常在贝鲁特以西的海面上旁若无人地往来巡逻，显显帝国主义的威风。海军陆战队又常在贝鲁特登陆喝酒，侮辱妇女，因此贝鲁特人一见了他们就避之惟恐不及。有时他们在贝鲁特的附近试验新武器（贝鲁特在他们的心目中已成了变相的军事基地）。他们在贝鲁特街头横冲直撞，使许多黎巴嫩人怒目而视。
    当我们在去年12月4日又乘飞机离开贝鲁特前往突尼斯的时候，我曾从飞机上俯瞰着“乱石崩云，惊涛裂岸，卷起千堆雪”的地中海，遥祝黎巴嫩人民的反美情绪终究会有一天像波涛汹涌的地中海一样而冲破了美帝国主义所筑成的“岸”的。
