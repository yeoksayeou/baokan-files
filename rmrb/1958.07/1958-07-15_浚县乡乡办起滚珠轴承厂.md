Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 14th (Reporter Liu Jiansheng) - The people of Junxian County, Henan Province, are vigorously developing the ball bearing manufacturing industry. After twenty days of hard work, they have established twenty-seven ball bearing factories, achieving a ball bearing factory in every township. By the end of June, according to preliminary statistics, these factories had produced 198,320 ball bearings and 5,087 steel sleeves.

The success of establishing ball bearing factories has greatly promoted the agricultural tool reform movement. Currently, more than 12,000 tools in the county have been modified with ball bearing steel sleeves. In six townships, tools such as double-wheeled double-shared plows, waterwheels, and carts have basically achieved ball bearingization. According to preliminary calculations, improving these tools can save 4,444 units of labor and 1,850 head of livestock. Originally, it took three animals to pull a cart, but now two animals are enough, and it is much easier to pull. The efficiency of the modified waterwheels has increased sixfold compared to the past. The efficiency of the modified mills has also increased tenfold compared to the past. The masses summarized the advantages of ball bearings as "four mores and four lesses": (1) More work, less effort; (2) More lightweight, less bulky; (3) More convenient, less troublesome; (4) More efficient, less costly.

In the process of manufacturing ball bearings, Junxian County made do with whatever was available and utilized a large amount of waste material to solve the difficulties in establishing factories and production. When there was no raw pig iron, they used old waterwheel chains as a substitute. They also used indigenous methods to manufacture hand-cranked grinders, hand-cranked drilling machines, and other tools and machinery.

    浚县乡乡办起滚珠轴承厂
    据新华社郑州14日电　记者刘健生报道：河南省浚县人民大办滚珠轴承制造工业。他们经过二十天的苦战，已经办起了二十七个滚珠轴承厂，做到乡乡有滚珠轴承厂。到6月底，据初步统计，这些厂已经生产出滚珠十九万八千三百二十个，钢套五千零八十七套。
    办滚珠轴承厂的成绩，大大促进了农具改革运动。目前全县用滚珠钢套改装的工具已有一万二千多件。有六个乡的双轮双铧犁、水车、大车等工具基本实现滚珠轴承化。据初步计算，改进这些工具以后，能节省劳力四千四百四十四个，畜力一千八百五十头。原来三头牲口拉一辆大车，现在两头牲口就够，拉起来还轻得多。改装的水车，效率比过去提高六倍。改装的磨，效率也比过去提高十倍。群众给滚珠轴承总结出四多，四少：（1）干活多，出力少；（2）轻便多，笨重少；（3）省事多，麻烦少；（4）办事多，花钱少。
    浚县在制造滚珠轴承过程中，因陋就简，大量利用废料来解决办厂和生产中的困难。没有原料元铁，他们就用旧水车的链子来代替。他们并利用土办法制造出手摇磨床、手摇钻床等工具和机械。
