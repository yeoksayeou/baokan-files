Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 1st: The Ministry of Food recently convened a symposium in Zhengzhou on summer grain work in eight provinces—Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, and Shaanxi—focusing on the distribution of surplus grain in agricultural cooperatives after the summer harvest.

From the reports of representatives from various provinces at the symposium, China’s grain production has undergone tremendous and inspiring changes. According to statistics from these eight provinces, this year’s summer grain output increased by more than 21.4 billion jin compared to last year, a growth of approximately 64%. As a result of the contract allocation of grain procurement tasks for the 1958-1959 fiscal year in these eight provinces, the plan was increased by more than 7 billion jin, exceeding the original plan by 20%. The work of summer grain procurement and storage is progressing exceptionally rapidly. Many agricultural cooperatives completed their summer grain procurement and storage tasks in just three to five days, and many agricultural cooperatives can complete their annual national grain procurement tasks at one go in the summer. Representatives from various provinces unanimously agreed that the implementation of the contract management method for unified purchase and sale of grain has greatly promoted the great leap forward in agricultural production and grain work.

Representatives from various provinces generally reported that, in the context of increased summer grain production and bumper harvests, after agricultural cooperatives complete the national summer grain procurement tasks, retain rations, fodder, seeds according to the prescribed standards, and deduct the cooperative's reserve grain and other items, there is still a large amount of surplus grain. The amount of surplus grain in some agricultural cooperatives exceeds the national procurement task by one to several times; some even equal the total rations of all members for eight or nine months. There are three ways to handle this part of the surplus grain: First, the agricultural cooperative temporarily keeps it in custody, and after unified calculation in the autumn, most of it is used as the agricultural cooperative's reserve grain and public accumulation, and a small part (5% to 10% or 20% to 30%) is distributed to the members according to the principle of more work, more pay, to appropriately improve the food consumption of the members. The second is to sell this part of the surplus grain to the state during summer grain procurement, and after unified calculation in the autumn, it will be offset against the annual procurement task. The third is for the agricultural cooperative to decide on the handling method by itself. Most representatives at the meeting believed that the first method is more stable and feasible.

The symposium emphasized that with the great leap forward in agricultural production and the implementation of the contract management method for unified purchase and sale of grain, the above-mentioned surplus grain distribution of agricultural cooperatives is a new issue that deserves attention. It involves the relationship between the state, agricultural cooperatives, and members, and the relationship between accumulation and consumption, and must be treated cautiously and handled correctly. After discussion, the representatives attending the symposium reached the following consensus on the distribution of this part of the surplus grain in agricultural cooperatives: First, summer grain is only part of the annual grain production. Therefore, this part of the surplus grain in agricultural cooperatives in the summer must be unified with the autumn calculation before the amount of the annual surplus grain can be finally determined. Second, the distribution of this part of the surplus grain in agricultural cooperatives must implement the principle of using surplus to make up for deficiencies and take into account the needs of expanded reproduction, and first be used to replenish the agricultural cooperative's grain reserves and increase public accumulation. Third, it is appropriate to distribute the remaining part of the surplus grain to members on the basis of increased production and bumper harvests and surplus grain in the cooperative. However, this should not affect the agricultural cooperative's grain reserves and the needs of expanded reproduction. Fourth, the part of the surplus grain distributed to members is a non-fixed reward outside the prescribed grain retention standards. The amount of distribution depends on the actual situation of the surplus grain. Distribute if there is a surplus, and do not distribute if there is no surplus. The prescribed grain retention standards cannot be changed at will because of the distribution of this part of the surplus grain. Fifth, if agricultural cooperatives require selling more of this part of the surplus grain to the state in order to expand reproduction, the grain department should actively purchase it. If the agricultural cooperative does have difficulties in capital turnover and requires selling a larger portion of turnover grain, the grain department should also purchase it. However, the scope and duration of turnover grain should be appropriately stipulated. Sixth, the state should strengthen guidance on the distribution of surplus grain and the use of internal reserve grain in agricultural cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives should establish appropriate management systems.

The representatives of the provinces attending the symposium pointed out that putting politics in command is the fundamental guarantee for the rational distribution of surplus grain in agricultural cooperatives. Henan, Hebei, and other places have adopted the methods of great contending, great blooming, great debate, and big-character posters to present facts and reason, so that the masses deeply understand the meaning of "remembering lean years in bumper harvests and not forgetting hunger in times of plenty." Therefore, in some places, the masses voluntarily requested to lower inappropriate grain retention standards in order to increase the agricultural cooperative's grain reserves and expand reproduction. At the symposium, representatives from all over the country unanimously pointed out that before the contradiction between grain production and demand in our country has been fundamentally alleviated, and in the rural areas where the struggle between the two roads still exists, cadres of the grain department must, under the leadership of the Party, unremittingly do their work well. The idea that one can take a breath and relax the publicity and education on grain issues to farmers after the implementation of the contract management method for unified purchase and sale of grain is essentially a new right-leaning conservative thought, which is very wrong and harmful, and must be resolutely prevented and overcome.

    丰收不忘歉年  消费不忘积累
    粮食部召开会议研究农业社余粮分配问题
    新华社郑州1日电　粮食部最近在郑州召开了河南、江苏、安徽、山西、河北、山东、湖北、陕西八省的夏粮工作座谈会，着重研究了夏粮丰收以后农业社的余粮分配问题。
    从座谈会上各省代表的汇报看，我国的粮食生产已经产生了极其振奋人心的巨大变化。根据这八个省的材料统计，今年夏粮产量比去年增加二百一十四亿斤以上，增长64％左右。这八个省1958—1959年度粮食征购任务包干分配的结果，比原计划增加七十亿斤以上，即超过原计划20％。夏粮征购入库工作进展异常迅速，许多农业社只有三、五天时间就完成了夏粮征购入库任务，不少农业社在夏季就可以一次完成全年的国家粮食征购任务。各省代表一致认为，实行粮食统购统销包干管理办法，对于农业生产大跃进和粮食工作大跃进，都有很大的促进作用。
    各省代表普遍反映，在夏粮增产丰收的情况下，农业社完成国家的夏粮征购任务，按照规定的标准留下口粮、饲料、种子，并且扣除社的机动用粮等项目以后，仍有很大数量的余粮。有些农业社的余粮数量，超过国家征购任务一倍到几倍；有的甚至相当于全体社员八、九个月口粮的总数量。对这一部分余粮的处理办法，归纳起来有三种：第一种是由农业社暂时保管，待秋后统一计算，根据全年余粮数量，把大部分作为农业社的储备粮和公共积累，少部分（5％到10％或20％到30％）按照多劳多得的原则分配给社员，适当改善社员的粮食消费状况。第二种是在夏粮征购中把这部分余粮卖给国家，到秋后统一计算，抵作全年征购任务。第三种是由农业社自行决定处理办法。会上多数代表认为第一种办法比较稳妥可行。
    座谈会强调指出，随着农业生产大跃进，随着粮食统购统销包干管理办法的实施，上述农业社的余粮分配，是一个值得重视的新问题。它涉及国家、农业社、社员三者之间的关系问题，涉及积累同消费的关系问题，必须慎重对待，正确处理。经过讨论，出席座谈会的代表对农业社这一部分余粮的分配，取得了以下几点一致的看法：第一，夏粮只是全年粮食生产的一部分。因此，农业社夏季的这一部分余粮，必须同秋季统一计算以后，才能最后肯定全年余粮的数量。第二，农业社这一部分余粮分配，必须贯彻以丰补歉的方针，照顾扩大再生产的需要，首先用于充实农业社的粮食储备和增加公共积累。第三，在增产丰收、社有余粮的基础上，把其余的一部分余粮分配给社员，是应当的。但是，不应因此而影响农业社的粮食储备和扩大再生产的需要。第四，分配给社员的一部分余粮，是在规定的留粮标准以外一种不固定的奖励。分配数量的多少，根据余粮的实际情况而定。有余即分，无余即不分。不能因为分配这一部分余粮而随意改变规定的留粮标准。第五，农业社为了扩大再生产，要求把这一部分余粮多卖给国家一些，粮食部门应当积极收购。农业社确实由于资金周转困难，要求多卖一部分周转粮，粮食部门也应当予以收购。但是，周转粮的范围和期限，应当有适当的规定。第六，国家应当加强对农业社余粮分配和社内储备粮使用的指导。农业社则应当建立适当的管理制度。
    出席座谈会的各省代表指出，政治挂帅是农业社余粮分配合理的根本保证。河南、河北等地都采用大鸣大放大辩论大字报的方法，摆事实，讲道理，使群众深刻地懂得“丰收不忘歉年，饱暖不忘饥寒”的意义。因此，有的地方群众自动要求降低不适当的留粮标准，以增加农业社的储备粮和扩大再生产。在座谈会上，各地代表一致指出，在我国粮食生产和需要的矛盾还没有根本缓和以前，在农村仍然存在着两条道路的斗争的情况下，粮食部门的干部必须在党的领导下，坚持不懈地做好工作。那种认为实行粮食统购统销包干管理办法以后可以松一口气，可以放松对农民进行有关粮食问题的宣传教育等想法，实质上是一种新的右倾保守思想，是十分错误和有害的，必须坚决防止和克服。（附图片）
