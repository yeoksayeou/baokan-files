Eight Million Farmers in Henan Persist in Studying During the Busy Farming Season

(Our Correspondent Hao Jian reports) The broad masses of farmers in Henan Province are persisting in studying during the busy farming season, changing the past situation of "full house in winter, half in spring, scattered in wheat harvest." According to incomplete statistics, over eight million people in the province are persisting in studying during the busy farming season.

Party committees at all levels are actively leading the broad masses of farmers to persist in year-round study. Nanyang Prefecture's counties and townships seized the opportunity before the wheat harvest to carry out debates among the masses on whether they could persist in studying during the busy farming season and how to persist in studying. Now, 780,000 farmers in the region are still persisting in studying during the busy farming season. In Shangqiu Prefecture, only 190,000 people participated in busy farming season studies last year, but this year the number has increased to 1.7 million. Most counties and cities in Kaifeng, Shangqiu, Luoyang and other prefectures held conferences of active literacy workers before the wheat harvest in conjunction with celebrating the harvest, commending models, and exchanging experiences, which greatly promoted busy farming season study.

In order to adapt to the busy farming situation, local masses have paid special attention to closely integrating the form and content of teaching with production. Amateur schools and literacy classes in various places have set up study groups according to the various professional production teams for wheat harvesting, threshing, rice transplanting, etc. Xichuan County adopted this method to establish more than 5,400 study groups, enabling more than 70,000 people to persist in studying. During the busy farming season, farmers in various places bring tools, textbooks, blackboards, chalk, etc. when going to the fields, and use the breaks in production for study. Some areas have also arranged many rich and colorful study environments. Small literacy blackboards are hung on the edges of the fields, at crossroads, and on the threshing grounds. A new atmosphere of "no one to be seen in the villages, crowds in the fields, blackboards hanging from trees, reading sounds everywhere" is emerging everywhere. Many townships in Mi County, Taikang, Suiping and other counties have established textbook compilation committees. These textbooks mainly focus on advanced deeds in production. During the busy rice transplanting season, Huai Shu Commune in Suiping County compiled such a text: "Left hand holds the rice seedlings, right hand busy transplanting, eyes sharp, hands quick, technique must keep up, two feet apart, arms straight, waist bent down, left hand pushes three fingers, right hand plants two rows."

Because the broad masses have persisted in studying during the busy farming season, they have achieved great results in a short period of time. According to statistics from Nanzhao, Xichuan, and Xinye counties, more than 37,000 people have reached the literacy standard during the summer harvest and planting. At the same time, Wen County, Nanle, and Jiaozuo have emerged as three counties and cities without illiteracy. (Attached picture)

    村里不见人　地里人成群　黑板树上挂　遍地读书声
    河南八百万农民坚持农忙学习
    本报讯　记者郝健报道：河南省广大农民在农忙中坚持学习，改变了过去“冬满堂，春一半，麦忙散”的状况。据不完全的统计，全省坚持农忙学习的有八百多万人。
    各级党委积极领导广大农民坚持常年学习。南阳专区各县、乡抓紧麦收前的空隙时间，在广大群众中开展了农忙能不能坚持学习，怎样坚持学习等问题的辩论，现在，全区有七十八万农民在农忙时仍坚持了学习。商丘专区去年参加农忙学习的仅有十九万人，今年增加到一百七十万人。开封、商丘、洛阳等专区大部分县市，在麦收前结合庆祝丰收，召开了扫盲积极分子大会，表扬模范，交流经验，对农忙学习起到很大的推动作用。
    为了适应农忙情况，各地群众特别注意使教学的形式和内容密切结合生产。各地业余学校和扫盲班，都分别按照收麦、打场、插秧等各专业生产小组成立学习小组，淅川县采取这种办法成立了五千四百多个学习小组，使七万多人坚持了学习。在农忙中，各地农民下地时都带着工具、课本、黑板、粉笔等，利用生产空隙时间进行学习，有的地区还布置了许多丰富多采的学习环境，地头上、岔路口、麦场上，都挂着识字小黑板。到处出现
  “村里不见人，地里人成群，黑板树上挂，遍地读书声”的新气象。密县、太康、遂平等县很多乡成立了教材编写委员会，这些教材以生产中的先进事迹为主要内容。遂平县在农忙期间编印了一万七千多册新教材，这个县的槐树社，在插秧时编了这样的课文：“左手拿稻秧，右手插秧忙，眼明手要快，技术要跟上，两足二尺远，臂直腰弯下，左手三指推，右手两行插。”
    由于广大群众坚持农忙学习，在短时期内，就获得了很大的效果。据南召、淅川、新野三县的统计，在夏收夏种当中又有三万七千多人达到扫盲标准。同时，全省出现了温县、南乐、焦作等三个无文盲县、市。（附图片）
