    Zhejiang Discovers a Large Copper Mine, Rare in the World

    (According to Zhejiang Daily) A large copper mine was recently discovered in a certain area of Zhejiang. This copper mine was found by the Sixth Geological Team of Zhejiang Province, inspired by the General Line and with a surge of revolutionary enthusiasm.

    The ore body of this copper mine is 3,000 meters long, and the prospective reserves of the mining area are very large, making it a large copper mine rarely seen in the world. According to existing data, it is also currently the largest copper mine in China. The fallacy of British and American geologists that "China is a copper-poor country" has been completely shattered by this.

    The copper grade of this copper mine is very high. After sampling and testing, the average copper grade is above 1%. According to industrial requirements, an average copper grade of 0.5% is already worth mining.

    Copper is a mineral raw material urgently needed for national industrial construction and has a wide range of uses in the machinery and electric power industries. The manufacture of machine tools, generators, etc., cannot do without copper. The discovery of this copper mine is of great significance to China's industrial construction.

    浙江发现世界少有的大铜矿
    据浙江日报讯　一座大铜矿，最近在浙江某地发现。这座铜矿是浙江省第六地质队在总路线的鼓舞下鼓足革命干劲找到的。
    这座铜矿，矿体长达三千公尺，矿区的远景储量很大，是世界罕见的大铜矿，根据现有资料，也是目前我国最大的铜矿。英美地质学者所谓“中国是一个贫铜国家”的谬论由此已彻底破产。
    这座铜矿的含铜品位很高。经取样试验分析，含铜品位平均在1％以上。按工业要求含铜品位平均在0.5％即有开采价值。
    铜是国家工业建设急需的矿物原料，在机械、电力工业方面有着广泛的用途，制造工作母机、发电机等，都离不了铜，这座铜矿的发现对我国工业建设具有非常重要的意义。
