Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: The exhibits recommended by the National Farm Tool Exhibition to various regions have begun to be copied. These copied exhibits are named "National Farm Tool Exhibition Selected Collection" and will be distributed to each province, autonomous region, and city as a set for exhibition at local farm tool exhibitions.

Since its opening, the National Farm Tool Exhibition has received many letters from people who could not visit Beijing, requesting that the designs of many exhibits be sent to them so that they could study, copy, and use them. The decision to send the "Selected Collection" this time is to meet the needs of the masses, so that various excellent farm tools can be mass-produced and promoted in suitable areas, and to inspire people's thinking and further promote the farm tool improvement movement.

The "Selected Collection" includes about 300 exhibits. Among these exhibits are tools for cultivation, farmland irrigation and drainage, water conservancy construction, and processing of agricultural and sideline products, as well as tools for planting cash crops, plant protection, rural transportation, and animal husbandry and forestry production. They have all been highly praised by visitors from various regions at the exhibition. Their common characteristics are: simple structure, easy to manufacture; using little or no steel, low cost; light to use, and able to significantly improve labor efficiency.

These exhibits are being copied by more than 40 production units affiliated with the Beijing Woodware and Hardware Production Cooperative United Society, the Machinery Industry Company, the Hardware Industry Company, and the Timber Industry Company. After the copying task was assigned in late June, the workers believed that this was the most glorious task to support the great leap forward in agricultural production, and they all expressed that they would ensure that they would be completed by the end of July as required.

    让优良农具在全国推广
    农具展览会制造三百种展品分送各省区
    据新华社3日讯　全国农具展览会向各地推荐的展品已经开工仿制。这些仿制的展品定名为“全国农具展览会精选馆”，将分送给每个省、自治区和市一套，供各地举办农具展览会时展出。
    全国农具展览会自开幕以来接到很多不能来京参观的群众来信，要求把很多种展品的图样寄给他们，以便研究仿造使用。这次送“精选馆”的决定，就是为了满足群众的要求，让各种优良农具在适合使用的地区大量仿制推广；并且借以启发人们的思想，进一步推动农具改良运动。
    选入“精选馆”的展品共有三百种左右。在这些展品中，有耕作、农田排灌、水利施工、农副业产品加工等工具，也有种植经济作物、植物保护、农村交通运输和畜牧业、林业生产等方面的工具。它们在展览会上都深受各地参观人员的称赞。它们共同的特点是：构造简单，容易制造；不用或只使用很少的钢材，造价低廉；使用轻巧，能够显著地提高劳动效率。
    这些展品由北京市木器、五金生产合作社联合社和机械工业公司、五金工业公司、木材工业公司等单位所属的四十多个生产单位仿制。6月下旬，仿制任务交下来后，工人们认为这是支援农业生产大跃进的最光荣的任务，纷纷表示要保证按照要求在7月末制完。
