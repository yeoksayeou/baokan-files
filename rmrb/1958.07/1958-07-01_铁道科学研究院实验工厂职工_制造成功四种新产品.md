(Reported by this newspaper) Under the illumination of the General Line, all employees of the Experimental Factory of the Academy of Railway Sciences actively rushed to manufacture four new products: a facsimile telegraph machine, a six-line resistance strain gauge, a vibration meter, and a mechanical strain gauge, as a gift to the Party’s birthday on "July 1st". After eight days and nights of hard work, all four new products were successfully manufactured according to design requirements by June 28th. The facsimile telegraph machine is a new type of communication equipment, and its biggest feature is that it can directly transmit text and pictures, and it can also solve the problem of train pre-departure and confirmation reporting that urgently needs to be solved in railway transportation. The six-line static and dynamic resistance strain gauge was not previously produced in China, and currently only three-line gauges are produced. This instrument can be used by manufacturing departments and scientific researchers of locomotives, airplanes, automobiles, ships, cranes, power machinery, machine tools, etc. In terms of basic construction, if this instrument is installed in bridges, it can play an appraisal role for a long time. During the trial production process, young technician Ding Bangzheng painstakingly researched and improved the balanced bridge circuit relatively well.

    制造成功四种新产品
    本报讯　在总路线照耀下，铁道科学研究院实验工厂全体职工，积极赶制传真电报机、六线电阻应变仪、震动仪、机械应变仪四种新产品，作为向党的生日“七一”献礼。职工们经过八天八夜的苦战，到6月28日四种新产品全部根据设计要求制造成功。传真电报机是一种新型的通讯设备，它的最大特点是可以直接传送文字和图片，同时可以解决铁路运输中急需要解决的列车预确报问题。六线静动电阻应变仪，以前国内不生产，目前生产只有三线的。该仪器可以供机车、飞机、汽车、轮船、起重机、电力机械、车床等制造部门和科学研究人员之用，在基本建设方面如桥梁要是安装了这种仪器，就可以长时期起鉴定作用。在试制过程中，青年技术员丁邦正苦心钻研，并将平衡电桥回路作了比较完善的改进。
