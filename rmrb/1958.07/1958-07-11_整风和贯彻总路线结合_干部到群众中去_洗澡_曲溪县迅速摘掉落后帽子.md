Integrating Rectification Campaign with Implementation of the General Line: Cadres Go to the Masses for a "Bath"
Quxi County Quickly Sheds Its Backward Label

(Reported by our correspondent Zhang Tinggan) Yunnan Province's Quxi County, by employing a method that combines the rectification campaign in government offices with the rural rectification campaign, and integrates the nationwide rectification with the implementation of the General Line, has carried the rectification movement through to the end, promoted the comprehensive development of all work, and quickly shed its label as a "backward county."

Before the launch of the nationwide rectification campaign, political work in the rural areas of Quxi County was quite weak. Out of the county's forty-one rural branches, about twenty could not fully exert their core role. The spontaneous forces of the wealthy middle peasants were rampant, greatly affecting the production enthusiasm of the masses. By the end of April, the average attendance rate in the townships and cooperatives was only about 80%, and the progress of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, agricultural tool reform, and planting of major spring crops was also very slow. Therefore, the county was once considered one of the more backward counties in the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture.

After the rectification began, the county party committee moved the government offices to the countryside, allowing the "two antis" movement in the leading organs to directly meet the nationwide rural rectification movement, mutually promoting and combining them. County, district, and township cadres adopted the method of eating, living, and laboring together with the peasants, deeply mobilizing the masses, enabling more than 50,000 peasants throughout the county to directly or indirectly participate in the rectification of the cadres, fiercely attacking the cadres' conservative thinking and "three winds and five airs" (subjectivism, sectarianism, bureaucracy; love of ease and comfort, extravagance, formalism, individualism, and commandism). During the movement, more than 360 cadres throughout the county directly received criticism and education from the masses. A cadre sent to Daying Township was unwilling to eat, live, and labor with the masses, and often strolled the streets and slept, so the masses pasted big-character posters on his quilt, criticizing his lethargy and squeamishness. A cadre assigned to Dianlu Township was having personal issues during the rectification and was not properly leading the masses in production, so the peasants asked him to come to the fields every day for debates, asking him: What have you done to lead us? How much labor have you participated in? After the criticism and education from the masses, these cadres have generally begun to change their work style, gradually forming a new atmosphere of appearing as laborers and treating the masses with an equal attitude.

After the publication of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the county party committee immediately seized the opportunity, organized a propaganda team of more than 1,800 people, and conducted large-scale General Line propaganda activities through reports, forums, debates, household visits, and assigning individual responsibilities, ensuring that most people could speak and understand within a few days. The two movements of the nationwide rectification and the vigorous implementation of the General Line converged into one, making the rectification movement even more vibrant, colorful, healthy, and lively. During this period, the number of big-character posters posted throughout the county increased from more than 40,000 to more than 60,000, and large and small on-site debate meetings were held everywhere. Every township and cooperative had its own advanced and backward sites, and each site had real people and real events. Team Eight and Team Four of Dongshan No. 1 Cooperative had three plots of land closely connected. Team Eight planted 25,000 seedlings per mu on their two plots, while Team Four planted only 13,000 seedlings per mu on their plot, and the spacing was uneven, and the base fertilizer was insufficient. The two teams held a meeting at the edge of the field, and everyone calculated a reduction in production for this plot, focusing their criticism on the team leader of Team Four's idea of only seeking speed and quantity without considering quality and thrift. An old woman was heartbroken and asked the team leader why he did not hand over the Party's policies to the masses for implementation. In Dongshan, Guanyi, Longjie, Daying and other townships alone, more than 300 various on-site debate meetings were held. During the movement, emphasis was also placed on commending good people and good deeds that embodied the spirit of the General Line in work and production. More than 2,000 people in the county were commended and rewarded during the rectification. The masses presented these people with glory ribbons and glory flowers and sent the good news to their homes. In addition, on-site meetings were held to listen to their advanced experiences.

The masses improved their awareness during the rectification, bringing a new look to the county's production. In the severe struggle against drought during planting and seedling protection, the county's labor attendance rate remained at 100%. The people of Quxi finally overcame the major drought that had not occurred in forty years and completed the planting of major spring crops and cash crops. The early rice in Quxi County has generally exceeded one meter in height and has begun to head and tassel. Old farmers said that this year's spring crops are the best crops they have seen in decades. The nationwide rectification movement has also brought about a high tide in local industrial construction. During the rectification period, the number of local industrial factories and mines in the county increased from dozens to more than a thousand.

Recently, the inspection team of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee conducted a comprehensive inspection of Quxi's work and believes that the county has basically changed the backwardness of all its work through the rectification movement and is striding towards the ranks of "advanced counties."

    整风和贯彻总路线结合　干部到群众中去“洗澡”
    曲溪县迅速摘掉落后帽子
    本报讯　记者张廷干报道：云南省曲溪县运用机关整风和农村整风相结合、全民整风和贯彻总路线相结合的方法，把整风运动进行到底，推动了各项工作的全面发展，迅速摘掉了“落后县”的帽子。
    在全民整风运动开展之前，曲溪县的农村政治工作相当薄弱，全县四十一个农村支部，不能充分发挥核心作用的就有二十来个。富裕中农的自发势力嚣张，大大影响了群众的生产积极性。到4月底，各乡社的出勤率平均才到80％左右，水利、积肥、农具改革和大春作物的栽插进度也很迟缓。因此这个县曾被认为是红河哈尼族彝族自治州工作较为落后的一个县。
    整风开始后，县委把机关搬到农村，使领导机关的双反运动与农村全民整风运动直接见面，互相推动，结合进行。县、区、乡各级干部采取和农民同吃同住同劳动的方式深入发动群众，使全县五万多农民都直接、间接地参加了对干部的整风，猛攻干部的保守思想和三风五气。在运动中，全县有三百六十多个干部直接受到了群众的批评教育。派到大营乡的一个干部不愿和群众同吃同住同劳动，经常逛街睡大觉，群众便把大字报贴在他的被子上，批判他的暮气和娇气。分到甸鲁乡的一个干部在整风中闹个人情绪，不好好领导群众生产，农民们便天天请他到田间去辩论，问他：你领导我们做了些什么？你参加了多少劳动？经过群众的批评教育，这些干部已经普遍开始转变作风，逐渐形成了一种以劳动者的姿态出现、以平等态度对待群众的新风气。
    党的社会主义建设总路线公布以后，县委立即抓紧时机，组织了一千八百多人的宣传队伍，通过报告、座谈、辩论会和家庭访问、分工包干到户到人等方式，进行大规模的总路线宣传活动，几天之内就做到了使大多数人能说能懂。全民整风和大张旗鼓贯彻总路线两个运动汇流为一，使整风运动进行得更加有声有色、健康活泼。这段时间，全县贴出的大字报由四万多张增加到六万多张，到处都开了大大小小的现场辩论会，乡乡社社都有自己的先进现场和落后现场，每个现场都有活人活事。东山一社八队和四队有三块田紧紧相连，八队的两块每亩栽种两万五千窝，四队的一块每亩才栽了一万三千窝，而且株距不匀，底肥不足。这两个队举行了田边会，大家给这块田算了一笔减产账，集中地批判了四队队长只图多快不顾好省的思想。一位老婆婆心痛得热泪盈眶，责问队长为什么不把党的政策交给群众执行。单是东山、馆驿、龙街、大营等乡，就先后举行了各种现场辩论会三百多次。在运动中，各地也着重表扬了在工作和生产中贯彻了总路线精神的好人好事。全县整风中受到表扬奖励的有两千多人，群众给这些人戴光荣条、光荣花，并把喜报送到他们的家里。另外，还开现场会议，倾听他们的先进经验。
    群众在整风中提高了觉悟，使全县生产面貌焕然一新。在严重的抗旱栽插、抗旱保苗斗争中，全县劳动出勤率一直保持了100％的纪录。曲溪人民终于战胜了四十年来没有过的大干旱，完成了大春作物和经济作物的栽种任务。连吃水都发生了困难的辽远乡人民，经过整风鼓足了干劲，用九十六台水车把河水车到九十公尺高的山上，抢种了四百多亩稻谷和二百多亩包谷。目前，曲溪县的早稻已经普遍超过了一公尺高，开始打包吐穗。老农们说，今年的大春作物是几十年来没有见过的好庄稼。全民整风运动也给地方工业建设带来了高潮，在整风期间，全县地方工业厂矿由几十个厂矿发展到一千多个。
    最近，中共云南省委检查团对曲溪的工作进行了全面检查，认为这个县经过整风运动，已经基本上改变了各项工作的落后面貌，正在向“上游县”的行列大踏步迈进。
