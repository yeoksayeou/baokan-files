    One Lychee Tree Bears Over 3,500 Catties of Fruit

    In Jiuhu Township, Longxi County, Fujian Province, there is a large lychee tree. This year, thanks to the agricultural cooperative organizing six young members to specially manage the large fruit trees, providing timely fertilizer, adding soil, and eliminating pests, coupled with suitable weather, early and abundant flowering, the tree bore a bountiful harvest. It yielded 3,577 catties of fresh lychees, setting a new national record for single-tree lychee production.

    According to local veteran farmers, this lychee tree is already 500 years old. Its branches and leaves are still lush and it flowers and bears fruit every year, but it has never borne as much fruit as it has this year. The agricultural cooperative in the township has now taken measures to care for it.

    一株荔枝结果三千五百多斤
    福建龙溪县九湖乡，有株大荔枝树，今年由于农业社组织六个青年社员专管大果树，及时追肥、添土、扑杀了害虫，加上气候适宜，花早花多，结果累累，摘到新鲜荔枝三千五百七十七斤，创全国荔枝单株产量高纪录。
    据当地老农反映：这株荔枝已有五百年树龄，现在枝叶仍然茂盛，年年开花结果，但像今年结果这样多，是从来未见过的。现在该乡农业社已采取措施，加以护理。
