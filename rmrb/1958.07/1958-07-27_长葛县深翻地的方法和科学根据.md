Deep Plowing Methods and Scientific Basis in Changge County
Zhang Junchang, Soil Teaching and Research Group, Northwest Agricultural College
Niu Pu, Cultivation Teaching and Research Group

After the People's Daily published an article by Comrade Lü Bingguang, First Secretary of the Changge County Party Committee in Henan Province, on deep plowing in May this year, our college sent us to Changge County for a week to visit and study in order to improve the quality of teaching and scientific research. Here, we will introduce the methods of deep plowing and deep cultivation currently used by the masses in Changge County, as well as our own experiences, for reference in various regions.

Ten Methods

Farmers in Changge County use a variety of plowing methods. Different methods naturally have different effects on increasing production, but all methods can increase production to varying degrees. They are introduced separately as follows:

(1) "Kite Somersault" Method

It is the most thorough and comprehensive way to deeply plow the land, with a plowing depth of two and a half to three feet, and its effectiveness can last for three or four years. It has the best effect on increasing production and is suitable for use during land leisure periods. The soil overturning situation is shown in the figure.

The plowing steps are as follows: 1. The width of the starting furrow should be twice the width of the working strip. The width of the starting furrow in the local area is generally about four or six times the width of a plowing shovel, with a total width of two to three city feet. First, dig out the topsoil (six to eight inches) and place it slightly away to the left of the furrow, as shown by the arrow in the figure. 2. After the topsoil in the first strip is dug out, clean the bottom with a shovel. Apply farmyard manure on the second layer and use a digging hook to deeply plow to a depth of eight to nine inches to mix the manure and soil evenly. 3. After the second layer of manure and soil are mixed evenly, dig out half of it on the right side and place it closer to the left side of the furrow bank. 4. After removing the right half of the second layer, apply fertilizer on the exposed third layer, and then deeply plow with a digging hook to a depth of eight to nine inches to mix the manure and soil evenly, and then leave it in the furrow. So far, the deep plowing work of the first strip is completed, and then the deep plowing of the second strip is carried out. 5. The width of the second strip is half of the first strip. When deep plowing the second strip, first dig out the topsoil (same depth as before) and move it to the left half of the second layer in the first strip. 6. Then apply fertilizer on the exposed second layer, deeply plow with a digging hook, and mix the manure and soil. After mixing, shovel it into the third layer of the right half of the first strip as the second layer. 7. Apply fertilizer on the third layer of the second strip, deeply plow with a digging hook, mix the manure and soil, and leave it in place. 8. Move the topsoil of the third strip into the right half of the first furrow as the first layer; move the second layer after mixing with manure and soil onto the third layer of the second strip as the second layer; deeply plow the third layer, mix the manure and soil, and leave it in place. Deep plow in this order, and finally move the first layer dug out from the first strip and the second layer moved out after mixing with manure and soil into the last strip (first move in the second layer, then move in the topsoil), keeping the second layer below and the first layer above. 9. Apply fertilizer on the surface of the deeply plowed land, carry out shallow plowing to fertilize, and irrigate and harrow to prepare for sowing.

This method of deep plowing is very scientific and orderly. Its characteristics are: although the land is plowed very deeply, the surface topsoil is still placed on the surface, and the development of crops will not be affected by turning up raw soil; applying fertilizer layer by layer is convenient for applying large amounts of fertilizer, expanding the scope of crop roots; it is convenient for killing insects and eliminating weeds; it is convenient for storing water and conserving moisture; especially under the conditions of full irrigation, it can dissolve fertilizer and give full play to the effectiveness of fertilizer, significantly increasing crop yields. For example, Comrade Ma Tongyi, the branch secretary of Shengli No. 1 Cooperative, the pioneer of this deep plowing method in the county, used this deep plowing method in 1954 and obtained a high yield record of 1,073 jin per mu of spring corn. In 1956, the highest yield reached 1,164 jin per mu, and in 1957, it reached 1,319 jin. Generally, land that is deeply plowed in this way can increase production by an average of 30% to more than double compared to land that is not deeply plowed.

(2) Trench Plowing and Strip Planting Method

This deep plowing method is most suitable for crops with wide rows and large plants. Each deep plowing operation only accounts for half of the total cultivated land area, which can save labor. Although the effect of increasing production is not as good as the previous method, it can also increase production a lot. For example, in 1957, the Shengli No. 1 Cooperative planted corn using the "Kite Somersault" method, with a maximum yield of 1,319 jin per mu; the 67 mu using the trench plowing and strip planting method had an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu. Its working steps are as follows: 1. First, mark lines on the ground according to the width of the crop row spacing, and carry out trench plowing according to the lines. Generally, the width of trench plowing is about half of the row spacing. For example, if the row spacing of corn is two feet, the width of trench plowing is often about one foot to one foot and two inches. 2. When trench plowing, first place the surface topsoil of the first trench to the right of the trench, and place the subsoil of the second layer to the left of the trench (as shown in the figure). Then apply farmyard manure on the exposed third layer of soil, deeply plow with a digging hook, mix the manure and soil, and leave it in place. 3. Dig the second trench one foot or eight inches to the left of the bank of the first trench, move the cultivated surface topsoil of the second trench into the third layer of the first trench, and turn the subsoil of the second layer in the second trench out onto the ridge back to the left of the bank of the second trench. Add manure to the third layer, deeply plow, and mix the manure and soil. And so on, until the last trench, the cultivated surface topsoil on the right side of the first trench can be laid on the third layer of soil.

The characteristics of this deep plowing method are that the plowing depth can generally reach two feet to two and a half feet; if the subsoil of the second layer of the trench is placed on the ridge between the trenches, it is convenient for ripening; the plowed field surface presents an undulating shape of ridges and trenches, which can not only prevent the loss of surface rainwater, but also facilitate fertilization and irrigation before sowing. At the same time, during the growth of corn or other crops, the gradually ripened subsoil on the ridge back is continuously used to cultivate the roots in the trench until the original ridge and trench become ridge back, and the original ridge back becomes trench. In this way, on the one hand, the ripening of the soil can be promoted, and on the other hand, lodging can be prevented. When deep plowing in the second year, the ridge and trench that were plowed in the first year are changed to ridge back, and the ridge back that was not plowed in the first year is changed to ridge and trench. In this way, a piece of land can be completely plowed in two years. This is a good way to save labor for deep plowing, and is suitable for deep plowing of land for crops such as cotton, sweet potatoes, sorghum, tobacco, potatoes, and spring corn. Especially in slopes or mountains, if the direction of deep plowing can be along the contour lines, the plowed ridge back is enough to block water and store moisture; crops sown in the trench are more resistant to wind and cold, and soil cultivation can prevent lodging; if horizontal barriers can be added in the trench, it can also prevent the lateral loss of precipitation. Therefore, this method is worth considering when deep plowing land in mountainous areas or gentle slopes.

(3) Front Plow and Back Mattock Method

This is a method to deepen the cultivated layer under the condition of insufficient animal power. The front uses an eight-inch walking plow to plow the land, and the back is followed by a person who spreads farmyard manure into the plow furrow. After spreading fertilizer, four or five people immediately use digging hooks to deeply plow in the plow furrow to a depth of seven or eight inches in sections. In this way, one person plows the land and eight or nine people are needed to cooperate. About three or four mu can be deeply plowed every day. The depth of plowing and loosening the soil in this way can also reach more than one foot. Compared with shovel plowing, it can also increase work efficiency by nearly one time.

(4) Double-Layer Double-Moldboard Plow Deep Plowing Method

The double-layer double-moldboard deep plowing plow was successfully modified by Wang Shuiwang, a member of the Zengfumiao Township Xuanjin No. 1 Cooperative, using an eight-inch walking plow. The front plow turns the soil by 20 centimeters, and the rear plow shovel loosens the soil in the lower layer under the plow by another 10 to 15 centimeters. The total plowing depth can reach 30 to 35 centimeters. One person and two or three animals can deeply plow three to three and a half mu of land every day, which is more than ten times more efficient than manual plowing. The modification cost of each plow is only about seven yuan.

(5) Three-Plow Ridge Deep Plowing Method

This is a method used by farmers in the county to carry out deep plowing in the very tight situation of summer harvest and summer planting. When cultivating the land, a double-wheeled double-moldboard deep plowing plow and an eight-inch walking plow are carried out at the same time. First use a deep plowing plow to carry out deep plowing of more than 30 centimeters according to the row spacing of crop planting, and then use an eight-inch walking plow to turn the topsoil from both sides into the furrow of the deep plowing plow. In essence, this cultivation method is to form a planting row every three plows, the middle of the row is deeper, and the two sides are shallower (as shown in the figure). Crops will be planted or transplanted in the furrow of the deep plowing plow in the middle in the future. This method is suitable for crops such as corn, peanuts, soybeans, sweet potatoes, and tobacco.

(6) Medium Deep Two Shallow, Alternating Deep Plowing Method

This method is also a deep plowing method that adapts to the tight situation of summer harvest and summer planting. Deep plowing plows and eight-inch walking plows are used alternately, forming a situation where one plow is deep and one plow is shallow, with each appearing alternately (as shown in the figure). Sowing is done in the plow furrow after deep plowing.

(7) Raw Soil Does Not Move, Live Soil Moving Deep Plowing Method

This method of shovel plowing is quite similar to the "Kite Somersault" method, but this method only divides the soil into two layers for plowing, the depth is generally about one and a half feet, the plowing is shallower, and it is also more labor-saving (as shown in the figure). The steps of plowing are as follows: 1. First, turn the surface topsoil (six to seven inches deep) in the working width of the first strip (about one to two feet wide) to the right side outside the working width. 2. Apply farmyard manure on the lower layer of raw soil, and then use a shovel or digging hook to deeply dig eight to nine inches deep to mix the manure and soil evenly, and leave it in place. 3. Then, plow the second strip on the left side of the first working strip, with the same width as the first strip. First, move the surface topsoil of the second strip onto the raw soil of the first strip, and then fertilize and deeply plow the second layer, and then move the surface topsoil of the third strip onto the second strip, and fertilize, deeply plow, and so on in this order, and finally move the topsoil plowed out from the first strip onto the last strip.

(8) One Raw One Ripe, Deep Hoeing and Plowing After Planting Method

This method is similar to the trench plowing and strip planting described above. However, trench plowing and strip planting plows three layers of soil, and after plowing, the second layer of soil is placed on the ridge back, and the ground forms many trenches and ridges. This method divides the soil into two layers for plowing, and the ground is still relatively flat after plowing (as shown in the figure). The steps of plowing are: 1. Turn the surface topsoil of the first trench out to one side, fertilize and deeply plow the second layer of soil to mix the manure and soil evenly. 2. According to the width of the row spacing of the cultivated crop, dig the second trench at a certain distance, move the surface topsoil of the second trench into the first trench, and then fertilize and deeply plow the second layer. And so on, and finally move the surface topsoil of the first trench to the upper layer of the last trench. This deep plowing method is also suitable for crops with wide row spacing. Apply fertilizer on the deeply plowed trench before sowing, and then sow. After emergence, deeply hoe between the rows, and turn the row spacing into irrigation ditches by cultivating the soil.

(9) Front Plow and Back Cover Deep Plowing Method

This method is also a way to deepen the cultivated layer that saves labor. The front uses an eight-inch walking plow to plow 18 to 20 centimeters, and the back is followed by a single plow without a moldboard to deepen and loosen the soil in the same plow furrow by another 10 to 15 centimeters. In this way, two people and four animals can deeply plow three to four mu every day, which is seven to ten times more efficient than manual plowing.

(10) Combined with Smoke Fumigation Method

The characteristic of this method is to combine smoke fertilization when trench plowing to increase the source of fertilizer. Before trench plowing, first open a shallow trench on the ridge back and place a bamboo pole more than one zhang long in it. When trench plowing, pile the soil blocks dug out of the trench on the bamboo pole and seal the outside with fine soil. After sealing, pull out the bamboo pole and place wet firewood in the middle for smoke fumigation. After fumigating, break up the soil blocks and apply them to the trench.

All of the above ten methods of deep plowing fully demonstrate the amazing wisdom and great courage of the working people. This year, most of the county's 330,000 mu of autumn land were deeply plowed last winter using methods (1) and (2), with an average application of 20,000 to 30,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Coupled with the fact that the county has now realized water conservancy, this year's corn grows with thick stalks and lush leaves, and the average yield is expected to be more than 1,000 jin. After this year's summer harvest, the county mobilized the masses to use eight other different methods to carry out a concentrated deep plowing of 500,000 mu, striving for a bumper harvest of various crops replanted in the summer.

Five Major Advantages

(1) The timing, urgency, and manpower of plowing can be fully adjusted: The forms of deep plowing in Changge are diversified. This diversification precisely shows that different crops have different cultivation methods and different cultivation seasons, so the timing of plowing is also relatively leisurely. For example, "Kite Somersault" and trench plowing and strip planting can be carried out in winter, and manpower can be fully adjusted to avoid the contradiction between manpower and work.

(2) The loose soil layer is thicker, which can expand the field of crops, and it is easy to achieve high yields. A deeper loose soil layer can expand the field of crop yield increase, and can also deepen the foundation of crops to prevent lodging. For example, Changge County has proposed a target of 200,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu based on deep plowing to a depth of one meter to one and a half meters. At first glance, it seems shocking, but according to the analysis of scientific theory, it can definitely be achieved. Because deep plowing to more than one meter, on the basis of layer-by-layer fertilization, due to the feeding habits of crops, it can penetrate into the lower layers of the soil for development. The morphological development of sweet potatoes is not only round but also elongated. In this way, each sweet potato is not only ten or eight jin, but fifty or sixty jin. If each mu is calculated with 4,000 seedlings, the yield target of 200,000 jin per mu can definitely be achieved.

(3) Layered fertilization is a good method to improve soil structure. In the process of layered fertilization and annual fertilization, a large amount of organic matter is accumulated in the soil, which is an important factor in soil fertility. It is not only the main source of nutrients absorbed by crops, but also an important factor in establishing a solid aggregate structure. These two things are necessary conditions to ensure stable and high yields of crops. Deep plowing is a good method to create anaerobic conditions in the lower layer of the soil. On the basis of layered fertilization, anaerobic bacteria in microorganisms carry out activities and development in the anaerobic environment, which can produce a large amount of brown humic acid, and a good soil structure (aggregate structure) can be created in the lower layer of the soil. Under the action of deep plowing (once every two or four years), the soil with good structure is transported from the deeper soil layer to the surface layer, and the soil with a relatively poor structure in the upper layer is turned down again to restore the aggregate structure. This will keep the soil in a good structure forever, which plays an important role in conserving water and nutrients, and is a good method to accelerate ripening.

(4) Deep plowing in saline-alkali areas can prevent salinization. The groundwater level in the Changge area is very high (generally two to three meters from the ground surface), and the water quality contains a lot of salt. During the bare ground exposure time, the evaporation is very large, which easily causes the rapid rise of capillary water, so that the soil forms a salinized phenomenon. Using this deep plowing method can eliminate this situation. Because deep plowing can cut off capillary action, so that the salt in the groundwater cannot rise in large quantities; and then use spring water and canal water on the ground to irrigate appropriately, it will not cause a large expansion of salinization.

(5) It is not easy to cause soil compaction. The reason why soil compaction often occurs in Guanzhong is because there are more clay particles in the soil and too little humus. Once the ground is hoeed or mechanically tilled, if the rainwater comes inappropriately, soil compaction will occur, affecting the increase in production. The principle of plowing in Changge is that live soil and dead soil (that is, ripe soil and raw soil) must be re-covered according to the original layers, that is, live soil is on top and dead soil is below, and crops take root in the live soil layer, so as not to turn up the solid and hardened soil below, and a large amount of organic fertilizer is applied, which greatly reduces the phenomenon of hardening, so it is not easy to cause soil compaction.

    长葛县深翻地的方法和科学根据
    西北农学院土壤教研组　张君常  耕作教研组　钮溥
    今年5月间，人民日报刊登了河南省长葛县委第一书记吕炳光同志关于深翻土地的文章后，我院为了提高教学和科学研究的质量，曾派我们亲往长葛县参观学习了一周。这里就将我们所看到长葛县群众现有深翻、深耕地的方法和我们自己的体会介绍出来，提供各地参考。
    十种方法
    长葛县农民的翻地方法是多种多样的。方法不同，增产效果自然也不一致，但是各种方法在不同程度上都能增产。现分别介绍如下：
            （1）鹞子大翻身法
    它是最彻底、最全面的深翻土地的方式，翻地深度达二尺半到三尺左右，功效可维持三、四年之久，增产效果最好，适宜于在土地休闲时期内进行。它的翻土情况如图所示。
    翻土步骤如下：1、开始起墒沟的宽度应为以后工作条幅宽度的二倍。当地起墒沟的宽度一般约为翻地铁锨宽度的四倍或六倍，共宽二、三市尺。第一次先将表层熟土（六至八寸）挖出，放置于沟左稍远之处，如图中的箭头所示。2、第一条幅中的熟土层挖出以后，用铁锨清底。在第二层上施入厩肥，用抓钩深刨八至九寸深，使粪土掺和均匀。3、第二层粪土掺匀以后，将它靠右边的一半挖出，放在靠沟岸左边较近之处。4、把第二层的右一半起出之后，再在所露出的第三层上施肥，再用抓钩深刨八至九寸，使粪土掺匀，铺平仍留置沟内。至此第一条幅的深翻工作，即算完成，然后进行第二条幅的深翻。5、第二条幅的宽度为第一条幅的一半。深翻第二条幅时，先将表层熟土（深度同前）挖出移置于第一条幅中第二层的左一半之上。6、然后在露出的第二层上施肥，用抓钩深刨，掺和粪土。掺匀后将它铲入第一条幅的右一半的第三层之上，作为第二层。7、在第二条幅的第三层上施肥，用抓钩深刨，掺和粪土，仍置原处。8、将第三条幅的表层移入第一沟的右一半作为第一层；第二层掺和粪土后移入第二条幅的第三层上作为第二层；第三层深刨掺和粪土后，仍置原处不动。就这样依次深翻，最后将第一条幅中挖出第一层和掺和粪土后移出的第二层，移入最后的条幅中（先移入第二层，后移入表层），仍保持第二层在下，第一层在上的位置。9、在深翻后土地的表层上施肥，进行浅耕翻肥和灌溉、耙耱等工作，以待播种。
    这种深翻土地的方法是很科学的，也是非常有秩序的。它的特点在于：土地虽然翻的很深，但表层熟土仍然放置在表层，不会因为翻出生土影响作物的发育；逐层施肥，便于施入大量的肥料，使作物根系的范围扩大；便于杀虫、灭草；便于蓄水、保墒；尤其是在充分灌溉的条件下，更能溶化肥料，发挥肥料的效力，显著的提高作物的产量。例如：该县此种土地深翻方式的首创者胜利一社支书马同义同志，1954年运用此种深翻方法曾获得春玉米亩产一千零七十三斤的高额纪录，1956年亩产最高达到一千一百六十四斤，1957年曾达一千三百一十九斤。一般如此深翻的地较不深翻的平均能增产30％至一倍以上。
          （2）沟翻条播法
    此种深翻方式，最适合于宽行大株的作物。每次深翻工作面积仅占全部耕地面积的一半，可以节约劳力。增产效果虽不如前一种大，但也可增产不少。如1957年胜利一社采用鹞子大翻身法种植的玉米，最高亩产一千三百一十九斤；采用沟翻条播的六十七亩，平均亩产一千斤。它的工作步骤如下：1，先按照作物行距的宽窄在地上划行，按行进行沟翻。一般沟翻的宽度约为行距的一半。如玉米的行距为二尺，则沟翻的宽度常为一尺至一尺二寸左右。2，进行沟翻时，先将第一沟的表层熟土置于沟右，第二层的生土置于沟左（如图所示）。然后在露出的第三层土上施厩肥，用抓钩深刨，掺和粪土，仍置原处不动。3，在距第一沟岸左侧一尺或八寸处开挖第二沟，将第二沟的耕层熟土移入第一沟内的第三层上，第二沟内第二层的生土仍翻出置于第二沟岸左侧的垅背上。仍在第三层上加粪、深刨、掺和粪土。如此类推，直至最后一沟时，可将第一沟右侧的耕层熟土铺于第三层土。
    此种深翻方式的特点，在于翻地深度一般也能达到二尺至二尺半深；如沟的第二层生土均放置在沟与沟之间的垅背上，便于进行熟化；翻后田面呈现一垅一沟的起伏形状，既可以阻止地面雨水的流失，也便于在播种前进行施肥及灌水。同时，在玉米或其他作物的生长过程中，不断以垅背上逐渐熟化了的生土向沟内根际培壅，直至原来的垅沟变为垅背，原来的垅背变为垅沟为止。如此，一方面可以促进土壤的熟化，一方面也可以防止倒伏。第二年进行深翻时，将第一年已经翻过的垅沟改作垅背，第一年未翻动的垅背改作垅沟，如此一块地两年可以全部翻完，这是节约劳力进行土地深翻很好的一种方式。适合于棉、甘薯、高粱、烟草、洋芋、春玉米等作物地的深翻。尤其是在坡地或山地中，深翻沟的方向如能沿等高线进行，则翻起的垅背足以拦水蓄墒；作物播种在沟内更能耐风耐寒，通过培土可以防止倒伏；如能在沟内增加横档又可阻止降水横向的流失。所以，在山区或缓坡地上进行土地深翻时，此种方法值得参考。
              （3）前犁后镢法
    这是在畜力不足的条件下，加深耕层的一种方法。前面用八吋步犁翻地，后边紧跟一人向犁沟内撒施厩肥。撒肥后紧接着再由四、五人分段用抓钩在犁沟内深刨七、八寸深。如此一人犁地，需要八、九人配合工作。每日约能深翻三、四亩。这种方式翻耕及松土的深度，也可达到一尺以上。比较锨翻也可提高工作效率将近一倍。
          （4）双层双铧犁深耕法
    双层双铧深耕犁是该县增福庙乡选进一社社员王水旺用八吋步犁改制成功的。前犁翻土二十公分，后犁铲在犁底下层松土又可达十至十五公分左右，合计犁耕的深度可及三十到三十五公分，每日一人、二畜或三畜，可深耕地三亩到三亩半，比用人力翻地提高效率十多倍。而每张犁的改制成本仅七元左右。
         （5）三犁冲脊深耕法
    这是该县农民为适应在夏收夏播十分紧张的情况下进行土地深耕的一种方式。耕地时双轮双铧深耕犁和八吋步犁同时进行。先用深耕犁按照作物播种的行距进行三十公分以上的深耕，然后再用八吋步犁自两边把熟土翻入深耕犁的沟内。实质上这种耕作方法是每三犁形成一条播种行，行的中间较深，两边较浅（如图所示），将来播种或栽植作物于中间深耕犁的犁沟上。此种方法适合于玉米、花生、大豆、甘薯、烟草等作物地。
        （6）中深两浅、隔格翻深耕法
    此种方式，也是适应夏收夏播的紧张情况而变通的一种深耕方式。深耕犁和八吋步犁交互使用，形成一犁深、一犁浅互相间隔出现的情况（如图所示）。播在深耕后的犁沟上。
        （7）生土不动、活土搬家深翻法
    此种锨翻土地的方法与鹞子大翻身法颇为相近，不过这种方法只分两层翻土，深度一般在一尺半左右，翻得较浅，也较为省工（如图所示）。它的翻地步骤如下：1、在第一条幅的工作宽度上（约宽一至二尺）先把表层熟土（六至七寸深）翻在工作幅外的右边。2、在下层的生土上施厩肥，施后用铁锨或抓钩再深挖八至九寸深，使粪土掺和均匀，放置原处不动。3、接着在第一工作条幅的左边，翻第二条幅，宽度同于第一条幅。首先，把第二条幅的表层熟土移于第一条幅的生土之上，然后再施肥深刨第二层，以后再将第三条幅的表层熟土移置于第二条幅之上，施肥、深刨等依次这样翻下去，最后将第一条幅翻出的表土熟土，移置在最末的条幅之上。
      （8）一生隔一熟，种后深锄翻土法
    此法类似前述的沟翻条播。不过沟翻条播是翻三层土，翻后将第二层土置于垅背上，地面形成许多的沟和垅。这一种方法是分两层翻土，翻后地面仍较平坦（如图所示）。它的翻土步骤是：1、将第一沟的表层熟土翻出置于一旁，在第二层土上施肥深刨，使粪土掺和均匀。2、根据栽培作物行距的宽窄，在相隔一定距离处开挖第二沟，将第二沟的表层熟土移入第一沟，再施肥深翻第二层。如此类推，最后将第一沟的表层熟土，移置于最末一沟的上层。此种深翻方式，也是适合于行距较宽的作物。播种前在深翻的沟上施肥，然后播种。出苗后在行间深锄，通过培土，把行间改为灌溉沟。
      （9）前犁后套深耕法
    此种方式也是加深耕作层中较为节省人力的一种方式。前面用八吋步犁耕翻十八至二十公分，后面紧接着再用不带犁镜的独犁在同一犁沟中再加深松土十至十五公分。如此二人四畜，每日也可深耕三、四亩，比较人工翻地提高工作效率七至十倍。
      （10）结合熏烟法
    此种方法的特点是在进行沟翻时，结合熏肥，以增加肥料来源。在进行沟翻前，在垅背上先开一浅沟，其中置一丈余长的竹竿。在沟翻时将沟中挖出的土块，堆置竹竿上，外用细土封住。封好后将竹竿抽出，中置湿柴草进行熏烟。熏好后将土块打碎施入沟中。
    所有以上十种深翻土地的方法，充分说明劳动人民的惊人的智慧和伟大的魄力。今年该县的三十三万亩大秋地，大部分都是去冬运用（1）（2）两种方法深翻的，每亩普遍施肥两三万斤，加以目前全县业已实现水利化，今年玉米就生长得秆粗叶茂，平均产量可望在千斤以上。今年夏收后，该县又动员群众，采用其他八种不同的方法，突击深耕，深翻了五十万亩，力争夏季复种的各种作物达到丰收。
      五大优点
      （一）翻地的时间、缓急、人力都能进行充分的调节：长葛深翻地的形式是多样化的，这种多样化正说明不同的作物有不同的耕作方式和不同的耕作季节，所以在翻地的时间上也是比较从容的。例如鹞子大翻身和沟翻条播可以在冬季进行，人力得以充分的调节，不致发生人力与工作的矛盾现象。
      （二）松土层较厚，可以扩展作物的领域，容易达高额丰产，较深的松土层可以扩大作物增产的领域，并能使农作物加深根基防止倒伏。例如长葛县在深翻一公尺到一公尺五深度的基础上，提出了亩产红薯二十万斤的指标，猛一听似乎是骇人听闻，根据科学理论的分析，肯定是可以达到的。因为深翻到一公尺以上，在层层施肥的基础上，由于作物的向食性可以深入到土壤下层发展，红薯的形态发展不只是圆形而是长形，这样一来，每株红薯不只是十斤八斤而是五十斤六十斤，每亩若以四千株苗计算，每亩二十万斤的产量指标肯定可以达到。
      （三）分层施肥是改良土壤结构的好方法。在分层施肥及年年施肥的过程中，土壤中蓄积有大量的有机质，它是土壤肥力的重要因素。它不但是作物吸收养料的主要源泉，而且也是建立巩固团粒结构的重要因素，这两种东西都是保证作物稳定丰产的必要条件。深翻土地是造成土壤下层嫌气条件的良好方法，在分层施肥的基础上，微生物中嫌气细菌在嫌气环境里进行活动和发展，就可以产生大量的褐色腐殖酸，在土壤的下层就可以创造出优良土壤结构（团粒结构）。在深翻地的作用下（二年或四年一次），使结构良好的土壤由较深的土层搬运到表层来，上层结构比较差的土壤再翻下去，进行恢复团粒的工作，这样就会使土壤永远保持优良的结构，对于保蓄水分养分起着重要的作用，是加速熟化的良好方法。
    （四）在盐碱地区深翻土地，可以防止发生盐渍化的作用。长葛地区地下水位很高（一般在离地表两公尺至三公尺），水质含盐分很多，在裸地露晒时间，蒸发量很大，很易引起毛管水的迅速上升，以致土壤形成了盐渍化的现象。利用这种深耕的方法，就可以消灭这种情况。因为深耕可以截断毛管作用，使地下水中的盐分不能大量上升；再利用地上泉水、渠水适量的予以灌溉，就不致引起大量盐渍化的扩展。
      （五）不易发生浇墒现象。关中土壤所以时常发生浇墒现象，是因为土壤中粘粒较多、腐殖质过少的原因。一经扎地或机耕，如遇雨水来的不适宜，就发生了浇墒，影响了增产。长葛翻地的原则是活土死土（即熟土，生土）必须按照原定层次再行复盖，即活土在上死土在下，作物在活土层上扎根，这样不致把坚实粘化的下土翻上，而且施有大量的有机肥料，大大的减轻了粘化现象，所以就不易发生浇墒现象。　　　　　　（原载陕西日报，本报略有删节）
