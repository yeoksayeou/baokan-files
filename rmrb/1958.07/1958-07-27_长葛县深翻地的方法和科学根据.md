After the People's Daily published an article by Comrade LÃ¼ Bingguang, First Secretary of the Changge County Party Committee in Henan Province, on deep plowing in May this year, our college sent us to Changge County for a week to visit and study in order to improve the quality of teaching and scientific research. Here, we will introduce the methods of deep plowing and deep cultivation currently used by the masses in Changge County, as well as our own experiences, for reference in various regions.

Ten Methods

Farmers in Changge County use a variety of plowing methods. Different methods naturally have different effects on increasing production, but all methods can increase production to varying degrees. They are introduced separately as follows:

(1) "Kite Somersault" Method

It is the most thorough and comprehensive way to deeply plow the land, with a plowing depth of two and a half to three feet, and its effectiveness can last for three or four years. It has the best effect on increasing production and is suitable for use during land leisure periods. The soil overturning situation is shown in the figure.

The plowing steps are as follows: 1. The width of the starting furrow should be twice the width of the working strip. The width of the starting furrow in the local area is generally about four or six times the width of a plowing shovel, with a total width of two to three city feet. First, dig out the topsoil (six to eight inches) and place it slightly away to the left of the furrow, as shown by the arrow in the figure. 2. After the topsoil in the first strip is dug out, clean the bottom with a shovel. Apply farmyard manure on the second layer and use a digging hook to deeply plow to a depth of eight to nine inches to mix the manure and soil evenly. 3. After the second layer of manure and soil are mixed evenly, dig out half of it on the right side and place it closer to the left side of the furrow bank. 4. After removing the right half of the second layer, apply fertilizer on the exposed third layer, and then deeply plow with a digging hook to a depth of eight to nine inches to mix the manure and soil evenly, and then leave it in the furrow. So far, the deep plowing work of the first strip is completed, and then the deep plowing of the second strip is carried out. 5. The width of the second strip is half of the first strip. When deep plowing the second strip, first dig out the topsoil (same depth as before) and move it to the left half of the second layer in the first strip. 6. Then apply fertilizer on the exposed second layer, deeply plow with a digging hook, and mix the manure and soil. After mixing, shovel it into the third layer of the right half of the first strip as the second layer. 7. Apply fertilizer on the third layer of the second strip, deeply plow with a digging hook, mix the manure and soil, and leave it in place. 8. Move the topsoil of the third strip into the right half of the first furrow as the first layer; move the second layer after mixing with manure and soil onto the third layer of the second strip as the second layer; deeply plow the third layer, mix the manure and soil, and leave it in place. Deep plow in this order, and finally move the first layer dug out from the first strip and the second layer moved out after mixing with manure and soil into the last strip (first move in the second layer, then move in the topsoil), keeping the second layer below and the first layer above. 9. Apply fertilizer on the surface of the deeply plowed land, carry out shallow plowing to fertilize, and irrigate and harrow to prepare for sowing.

This method of deep plowing is very scientific and orderly. Its characteristics are: although the land is plowed very deeply, the surface topsoil is still placed on the surface, and the development of crops will not be affected by turning up raw soil; applying fertilizer layer by layer is convenient for applying large amounts of fertilizer, expanding the scope of crop roots; it is convenient for killing insects and eliminating weeds; it is convenient for storing water and conserving moisture; especially under the conditions of full irrigation, it can dissolve fertilizer and give full play to the effectiveness of fertilizer, significantly increasing crop yields. For example, Comrade Ma Tongyi, the branch secretary of Shengli No. 1 Cooperative, the pioneer of this deep plowing method in the county, used this deep plowing method in 1954 and obtained a high yield record of 1,073 jin per mu of spring corn. In 1956, the highest yield reached 1,164 jin per mu, and in 1957, it reached 1,319 jin. Generally, land that is deeply plowed in this way can increase production by an average of 30% to more than double compared to land that is not deeply plowed.

(2) Trench Plowing and Strip Planting Method

This deep plowing method is most suitable for crops with wide rows and large plants. Each deep plowing operation only accounts for half of the total cultivated land area, which can save labor. Although the effect of increasing production is not as good as the previous method, it can also increase production a lot. For example, in 1957, the Shengli No. 1 Cooperative planted corn using the "Kite Somersault" method, with a maximum yield of 1,319 jin per mu; the 67 mu using the trench plowing and strip planting method had an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu. Its working steps are as follows: 1. First, mark lines on the ground according to the width of the crop row spacing, and carry out trench plowing according to the lines. Generally, the width of trench plowing is about half of the row spacing. For example, if the row spacing of corn is two feet, the width of trench plowing is often about one foot to one foot and two inches. 2. When trench plowing, first place the surface topsoil of the first trench to the right of the trench, and place the subsoil of the second layer to the left of the trench (as shown in the figure). Then apply farmyard manure on the exposed third layer of soil, deeply plow with a digging hook, mix the manure and soil, and leave it in place. 3. Dig the second trench one foot or eight inches to the left of the bank of the first trench, move the cultivated surface topsoil of the second trench into the third layer of the first trench, and turn the subsoil of the second layer in the second trench out onto the ridge back to the left of the bank of the second trench. Add manure to the third layer, deeply plow, and mix the manure and soil. And so on, until the last trench, the cultivated surface topsoil on the right side of the first trench can be laid on the third layer of soil.

The characteristics of this deep plowing method are that the plowing depth can generally reach two feet to two and a half feet; if the subsoil of the second layer of the trench is placed on the ridge between the trenches, it is convenient for ripening; the plowed field surface presents an undulating shape of ridges and trenches, which can not only prevent the loss of surface rainwater, but also facilitate fertilization and irrigation before sowing. At the same time, during the growth of corn or other crops, the gradually ripened subsoil on the ridge back is continuously used to cultivate the roots in the trench until the original ridge and trench become ridge back, and the original ridge back becomes trench. In this way, on the one hand, the ripening of the soil can be promoted, and on the other hand, lodging can be prevented. When deep plowing in the second year, the ridge and trench that were plowed in the first year are changed to ridge back, and the ridge back that was not plowed in the first year is changed to ridge and trench. In this way, a piece of land can be completely plowed in two years. This is a good way to save labor for deep plowing, and is suitable for deep plowing of land for crops such as cotton, sweet potatoes, sorghum, tobacco, potatoes, and spring corn. Especially in slopes or mountains, if the direction of deep plowing can be along the contour lines, the plowed ridge back is enough to block water and store moisture; crops sown in the trench are more resistant to wind and cold, and soil cultivation can prevent lodging; if horizontal barriers can be added in the trench, it can also prevent the lateral loss of precipitation. Therefore, this method is worth considering when deep plowing land in mountainous areas or gentle slopes.

(3) Front Plow and Back Mattock Method

This is a method to deepen the cultivated layer under the condition of insufficient animal power. The front uses an eight-inch walking plow to plow the land, and the back is followed by a person who spreads farmyard manure into the plow furrow. After spreading fertilizer, four or five people immediately use digging hooks to deeply plow in the plow furrow to a depth of seven or eight inches in sections. In this way, one person plows the land and eight or nine people are needed to cooperate. About three or four mu can be deeply plowed every day. The depth of plowing and loosening the soil in this way can also reach more than one foot. Compared with shovel plowing, it can also increase work efficiency by nearly one time.

(4) Double-Layer Double-Moldboard Plow Deep Plowing Method

The double-layer double-moldboard deep plowing plow was successfully modified by Wang Shuiwang, a member of the Zengfumiao Township Xuanjin No. 1 Cooperative, using an eight-inch walking plow. The front plow turns the soil by 20 centimeters, and the rear plow shovel loosens the soil in the lower layer under the plow by another 10 to 15 centimeters. The total plowing depth can reach 30 to 35 centimeters. One person and two or three animals can deeply plow three to three and a half mu of land every day, which is more than ten times more efficient than manual plowing. The modification cost of each plow is only about seven yuan.

(5) Three-Plow Ridge Deep Plowing Method

This is a method used by farmers in the county to carry out deep plowing in the very tight situation of summer harvest and summer planting. When cultivating the land, a double-wheeled double-moldboard deep plowing plow and an eight-inch walking plow are carried out at the same time. First use a deep plowing plow to carry out deep plowing of more than 30 centimeters according to the row spacing of crop planting, and then use an eight-inch walking plow to turn the topsoil from both sides into the furrow of the deep plowing plow. In essence, this cultivation method is to form a planting row every three plows, the middle of the row is deeper, and the two sides are shallower (as shown in the figure). Crops will be planted or transplanted in the furrow of the deep plowing plow in the middle in the future. This method is suitable for crops such as corn, peanuts, soybeans, sweet potatoes, and tobacco.

(6) Medium Deep Two Shallow, Alternating Deep Plowing Method

This method is also a deep plowing method that adapts to the tight situation of summer harvest and summer planting. Deep plowing plows and eight-inch walking plows are used alternately, forming a situation where one plow is deep and one plow is shallow, with each appearing alternately (as shown in the figure). Sowing is done in the plow furrow after deep plowing.

(7) Raw Soil Does Not Move, Live Soil Moving Deep Plowing Method

This method of shovel plowing is quite similar to the "Kite Somersault" method, but this method only divides the soil into two layers for plowing, the depth is generally about one and a half feet, the plowing is shallower, and it is also more labor-saving (as shown in the figure). The steps of plowing are as follows: 1. First, turn the surface topsoil (six to seven inches deep) in the working width of the first strip (about one to two feet wide) to the right side outside the working width. 2. Apply farmyard manure on the lower layer of raw soil, and then use a shovel or digging hook to deeply dig eight to nine inches deep to mix the manure and soil evenly, and leave it in place. 3. Then, plow the second strip on the left side of the first working strip, with the same width as the first strip. First, move the surface topsoil of the second strip onto the raw soil of the first strip, and then fertilize and deeply plow the second layer, and then move the surface topsoil of the third strip onto the second strip, and fertilize, deeply plow, and so on in this order, and finally move the topsoil plowed out from the first strip onto the last strip.

(8) One Raw One Ripe, Deep Hoeing and Plowing After Planting Method

This method is similar to the trench plowing and strip planting described above. However, trench plowing and strip planting plows three layers of soil, and after plowing, the second layer of soil is placed on the ridge back, and the ground forms many trenches and ridges. This method divides the soil into two layers for plowing, and the ground is still relatively flat after plowing (as shown in the figure). The steps of plowing are: 1. Turn the surface topsoil of the first trench out to one side, fertilize and deeply plow the second layer of soil to mix the manure and soil evenly. 2. According to the width of the row spacing of the cultivated crop, dig the second trench at a certain distance, move the surface topsoil of the second trench into the first trench, and then fertilize and deeply plow the second layer. And so on, and finally move the surface topsoil of the first trench to the upper layer of the last trench. This deep plowing method is also suitable for crops with wide row spacing. Apply fertilizer on the deeply plowed trench before sowing, and then sow. After emergence, deeply hoe between the rows, and turn the row spacing into irrigation ditches by cultivating the soil.

(9) Front Plow and Back Cover Deep Plowing Method

This method is also a way to deepen the cultivated layer that saves labor. The front uses an eight-inch walking plow to plow 18 to 20 centimeters, and the back is followed by a single plow without a moldboard to deepen and loosen the soil in the same plow furrow by another 10 to 15 centimeters. In this way, two people and four animals can deeply plow three to four mu every day, which is seven to ten times more efficient than manual plowing.

(10) Combined with Smoke Fumigation Method

The characteristic of this method is to combine smoke fertilization when trench plowing to increase the source of fertilizer. Before trench plowing, first open a shallow trench on the ridge back and place a bamboo pole more than one zhang long in it. When trench plowing, pile the soil blocks dug out of the trench on the bamboo pole and seal the outside with fine soil. After sealing, pull out the bamboo pole and place wet firewood in the middle for smoke fumigation. After fumigating, break up the soil blocks and apply them to the trench.

All of the above ten methods of deep plowing fully demonstrate the amazing wisdom and great courage of the working people. This year, most of the county's 330,000 mu of autumn land were deeply plowed last winter using methods (1) and (2), with an average application of 20,000 to 30,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Coupled with the fact that the county has now realized water conservancy, this year's corn grows with thick stalks and lush leaves, and the average yield is expected to be more than 1,000 jin. After this year's summer harvest, the county mobilized the masses to use eight other different methods to carry out a concentrated deep plowing of 500,000 mu, striving for a bumper harvest of various crops replanted in the summer.

Five Major Advantages

(1) The timing, urgency, and manpower of plowing can be fully adjusted: The forms of deep plowing in Changge are diversified. This diversification precisely shows that different crops have different cultivation methods and different cultivation seasons, so the timing of plowing is also relatively leisurely. For example, "Kite Somersault" and trench plowing and strip planting can be carried out in winter, and manpower can be fully adjusted to avoid the contradiction between manpower and work.

(2) The loose soil layer is thicker, which can expand the field of crops, and it is easy to achieve high yields. A deeper loose soil layer can expand the field of crop yield increase, and can also deepen the foundation of crops to prevent lodging. For example, Changge County has proposed a target of 200,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu based on deep plowing to a depth of one meter to one and a half meters. At first glance, it seems shocking, but according to the analysis of scientific theory, it can definitely be achieved. Because deep plowing to more than one meter, on the basis of layer-by-layer fertilization, due to the feeding habits of crops, it can penetrate into the lower layers of the soil for development. The morphological development of sweet potatoes is not only round but also elongated. In this way, each sweet potato is not only ten or eight jin, but fifty or sixty jin. If each mu is calculated with 4,000 seedlings, the yield target of 200,000 jin per mu can definitely be achieved.

(3) Layered fertilization is a good method to improve soil structure. In the process of layered fertilization and annual fertilization, a large amount of organic matter is accumulated in the soil, which is an important factor in soil fertility. It is not only the main source of nutrients absorbed by crops, but also an important factor in establishing a solid aggregate structure. These two things are necessary conditions to ensure stable and high yields of crops. Deep plowing is a good method to create anaerobic conditions in the lower layer of the soil. On the basis of layered fertilization, anaerobic bacteria in microorganisms carry out activities and development in the anaerobic environment, which can produce a large amount of brown humic acid, and a good soil structure (aggregate structure) can be created in the lower layer of the soil. Under the action of deep plowing (once every two or four years), the soil with good structure is transported from the deeper soil layer to the surface layer, and the soil with a relatively poor structure in the upper layer is turned down again to restore the aggregate structure. This will keep the soil in a good structure forever, which plays an important role in conserving water and nutrients, and is a good method to accelerate ripening.

(4) Deep plowing in saline-alkali areas can prevent salinization. The groundwater level in the Changge area is very high (generally two to three meters from the ground surface), and the water quality contains a lot of salt. During the bare ground exposure time, the evaporation is very large, which easily causes the rapid rise of capillary water, so that the soil forms a salinized phenomenon. Using this deep plowing method can eliminate this situation. Because deep plowing can cut off capillary action, so that the salt in the groundwater cannot rise in large quantities; and then use spring water and canal water on the ground to irrigate appropriately, it will not cause a large expansion of salinization.

(5) It is not easy to cause soil compaction. The reason why soil compaction often occurs in Guanzhong is because there are more clay particles in the soil and too little humus. Once the ground is hoeed or mechanically tilled, if the rainwater comes inappropriately, soil compaction will occur, affecting the increase in production. The principle of plowing in Changge is that live soil and dead soil (that is, ripe soil and raw soil) must be re-covered according to the original layers, that is, live soil is on top and dead soil is below, and crops take root in the live soil layer, so as not to turn up the solid and hardened soil below, and a large amount of organic fertilizer is applied, which greatly reduces the phenomenon of hardening, so it is not easy to cause soil compaction.
