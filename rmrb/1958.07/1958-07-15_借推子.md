　　Borrowing Clippers
　　Liu Ziwei
　　I was sitting in the barber shop waiting for a haircut when Zhao, the old man who runs the fruit stand across the street, came in. As soon as he entered, he greeted everyone: "Hey! I have something to discuss with you all."
　　"What is it?"
　　"I want to borrow a pair of clippers for a few days."
　　Everyone was surprised. One of the barbers said, "I've never heard of borrowing clippers from a barber shop. We only have one pair each."
　　"What do you need clippers for?"
　　"What for?..." The old man didn't rush to answer, turned around and sat on a stool. Then, unhurriedly, he said to everyone: "Today I went to the construction site where they're digging the water channel. Sigh, people are working so hard. One young man was carrying four baskets of soil at a time, and even the sturdy elm carrying pole broke under the weight. There's another who is even more capable; he finished six hours' worth of earthwork in one hour. You know Mr. Li, the old clerk from Taifeng Cloth Store? He's been cutting fabric for most of his life and doesn't even know how to use an iron spade, but this time he worked with great enthusiasm."
　　Everyone listened quietly, their faces showing excitement. When the old man paused, one of the workers asked in a somewhat joking tone: "I bet you sold a lot of fruit?"
　　The old man smiled sheepishly and said: "Don't mention it. People are sweating for everyone's happiness, and I feel really bad. I thought: How can I be lazy when it comes to building socialism? But I'm old and can't really help with the work. After thinking it over, I had an idea. People who are working have soil all over their heads, and it's uncomfortable when their hair is long. I also know a little about haircutting, so why not close my fruit stand and go to the construction site for a week to give everyone haircuts? Wouldn't that be my way of contributing to socialism?"
　　"Good!" everyone shouted in unison. This was followed by a burst of discussion throughout the room.
　　After a moment of silence, a young worker said: "Old man, come on, take your pick. Take the best pair we have."

    借推子
    刘子威
    我正坐在理发馆里等着理发，忽然街对面那个守水果摊子的赵老头进来了。他进门就打招呼；“喂！和你们商量件事情。”
    “什么事？” 
    “借把推子用几天。”
    人们都很诧异，一个理发工人说：“还没听说过向理发馆借推子的。我们一个人只有一把。”
    “借推子干什么？”
    “干什么？……”老头没有急于回答，转身坐到凳子上。然后不紧不慢的对大家说：“今天我到挖水渠的工地上去了。唉，人们都使劲的干。一个小伙子，一趟担四筐土，那么结实的榆木杠子都给压断了。还有一个更能干，六个钟点的土方，他一个钟点就挖完了。你们知道，泰丰布店的老店员李先生也去了。他扯了多半辈子布，连铁锨都不会使，这次也干了个欢。”
    大伙都静静的听着，脸上泛着兴奋的表情。当老头说话停顿的时候，一个工人带着几分开玩笑的口吻问道：“想必水果也卖了不少？”
    老头不好意思的笑了笑说：“别提啦，人家都为大伙儿的幸福流汗，我心里实在有些过意不去。我想：建设社会主义的事，我怎么能偷懒呢？可是自己年老了，干活也插不进手去。想来想去，有了。干活的人，满脑袋弄的都是土，头发长的才难受呢？我又会点推头的手艺，倒不如把水果摊子收了，到工地上去一星期，给大伙推推头，这也算为社会主义尽点心思吗。”
    “好！”大伙都不约而同的喊道。紧接着是全屋的一阵议论。
    一刹那间的宁静后，一个青年工人说：“老头，来，凭你挑。那把最好你拿那一把。”
