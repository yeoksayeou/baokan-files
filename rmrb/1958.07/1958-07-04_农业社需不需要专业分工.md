Do agricultural cooperatives need specialization of labor? This is a new question worthy of study.

Some people believe that agricultural work is simple. For thousands of years, farmers have handled all kinds of farm work themselves, so there is no need for specialization of labor. Agricultural work is seasonal, and if the division of labor is too detailed, it will be difficult to adjust manpower during the busy farming season, wouldn't that make the labor force even more insufficient?

These reasons are not entirely correct. The organization of labor has always been subject to the needs of production. What kind of production content there is, there is what kind of labor organization form. In the period of decentralized small-scale farming economy, each household was a production unit, and they carried out simple reproduction, even shrinking reproduction, year after year. In this case, "division of labor" and "specialization" were neither possible nor necessary. Today, the decentralized small-scale farming economy has become a large-scale cooperative economy, and it has entered the era of agricultural technological revolution. The situation has changed, and the form of labor organization must naturally change accordingly. In fact, it is already developing and changing: many agricultural cooperatives have established agricultural teams and sideline teams; then, forestry teams, animal husbandry teams, and infrastructure construction teams have been added... With the advent of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country, agricultural cooperatives have not only developed diversified operations centered on grain production and established various specialized teams; but also started running industries, which has added a set of small factory organizations. This series of facts shows that as production develops more and more, the division of labor becomes more and more detailed.

The news from the Sanba Cooperative in Sixian County, Anhui Province, published in this newspaper today, is a good example. According to the development of production, this cooperative timely changed the labor organization, implemented division of labor and specialization, and professional management, tapped the potential of the labor force, improved the quality of agricultural work, and established production order. Taking rice cultivation as an example, from耕地 (cultivating the land), 打埂 (bunding the fields), 灌水 (irrigating), 整地 (preparing the land) to 插秧 (transplanting seedlings), each process is in charge of by a specialist, and all farm work can be carried out in an orderly manner. After many agricultural cooperatives in Hunan established specialized teams, diversified operations centered on grain production have been fully developed. Sichuan Province also built a large number of water conservancy projects during the busy farming season because it established infrastructure construction teams, ensuring that both production and construction were not delayed.

People establish specialized teams to adapt to the needs of production. Similarly, for the needs of production, people will also correctly use specialized teams. It is unfounded to think that establishing specialized teams will waste labor. Some cooperatives in Hunan Province have established specialized teams, with both division of labor and cooperation: During the busy farming season, the sideline production team is subject to unified mobilization to support agricultural production; during the slack farming season, when sideline production is in full swing, the specialized team is the backbone, and the cooperative allocates labor to support sideline production.

Division of labor and cooperation are a unity of opposites. When advocating division of labor, it is necessary to emphasize strengthening unified leadership and mutual cooperation. Production technology specialization and all-round development are also a unity of opposites. The current proposal to divide labor and specialize, first in one field, aims to familiarize and master new technologies in a certain production aspect and improve the technical level of production as quickly as possible and in as short a time as possible; and this also lays the foundation and prepares the conditions for familiarizing and mastering technologies in other aspects. As agricultural production develops to a higher technical level, it will inevitably require people to become multi-faceted technical experts and become "all-rounders". This is the law of the development of things.

    农业社需不需要专业分工
    丁山
    农业社的劳动组织是不是需要专业分工？这是一个值得研究的新问题。
    有人认为：农活简单，几千年来农民都是全套农活一手揽，不需要专业分工；农活有季节性，如果分工太细，农忙时人手调剂不开，劳动力岂不更加不足了吗。
    这些理由都是不完全的。劳动组织从来就是服从生产需要的，有什么样的生产内容，就有什么样的劳动组织形式。在分散的小农经济时期，一家一户就是一个生产单位，他们年复一年地进行着简单再生产，甚至萎缩的再生产。在这种情况下，“分工”和“专业”既没有可能，也没有必要。今天，分散的小农经济已经变成了大规模的合作经济，而且已经进入了农业技术革命时期。情况变了，劳动组织形式自然也要随着发生变化。事实上，它已经在发展变化着：许多农业社建立了农业队和副业队；而后，又增添了造林队，畜牧队，基建队……。随着全国工农业生产大跃进的到来，农业社不仅发展了以粮食生产为中心的多种经营，建立了各种专业队；而且还办起工业来了，这又增添了一套小型工厂的组织。这一系列的事实说明，生产越来越发展，劳动分工也越来越细了。
    今天本报发表的安徽宿县三八社的消息，就是一个很好的例证。这个社根据生产发展的情况，及时地改变了劳动组织，实行了分工分业和专业管理，劳动力的潜力挖掘出来了，农活质量提高了，生产秩序建立起来了。以水稻作业为例，从耕地、打埂、灌水、整地到插秧，每一道工序都有专人负责，一切农活都能秩序井然地进行。湖南许多农业社建立专业队以后，以粮食生产为中心的多种经营得到全面发展。四川省也是因为建立了基建队，在农忙时修建了大量水利工程，作到生产建设两不误。
    适应生产的需要，人们建立了专业队。同样，为了生产的需要，人们也会正确地运用专业队。认为建立专业队会浪费劳动力，是没有根据的。湖南省的一些合作社，建立了专业队，有分工也有合作：农忙时，副业生产队服从统一调动，支援农业生产；农闲时，副业生产正紧张，就以专业队为骨干，由社调配劳动力支援副业。
    分工分业和相互协作是矛盾的统一。在提倡分工分业的时候，必须强调加强统一领导和互相协作。生产技术专业化和全面发展，也是矛盾的统一。现在提出要分工分业、先专一门，目的在于以最快的速度，在尽量短的时间内，熟悉和掌握某一生产方面的新技术，提高生产的技术水平；而这也是为熟悉和掌握其他方面的技术打下了基础，准备了条件。随着农业生产向更高的技术水平发展，必然要求人们成为多方面的技术能手，成为“万能人”。这就是事物发展的规律。
