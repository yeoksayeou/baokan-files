    Eisenhower's Banner is the Banner of Pirates

    Eisenhower's speech to the American people on July 15, the main points of which were later repeated by Macmillan and Lloyd, can be said to be a program for armed intervention in the Middle East by the Anglo-American aggressors. Peace-loving and freedom-loving people all over the world cannot fail to recognize this program.

    Eisenhower's speech put forward a set of gangster logic proving that aggressors can arbitrarily destroy the national independence of various countries and arbitrarily deprive the people of various countries of the right to exercise sovereignty. According to this logic, the American armed forces can invade any country and can occupy the whole world. This is a program that threatens world peace, a program for carrying out war mobilization.

    Eisenhower said that the US troops' occupation of Lebanon was for "the welfare of the United States," to "defend the lives of Americans" because "there are about two thousand five hundred Americans in Lebanon." However, this obviously cannot be the basis for sending troops to a foreign country. All countries in the world have their own "welfare," and most countries have overseas citizens in foreign countries. According to Eisenhower, wouldn't everyone be able to send troops to each other? Moreover, there is no threat to American overseas citizens in Lebanon at all. People know that when Hitler carried out armed intervention in Spain in July 1936, he said that it was to "protect the lives and property of Germans," which is exactly the same as Eisenhower's so-called "defending the lives of Americans." Japan also used the same excuse when it invaded China in 1931, 1932 and 1937. If this kind of gangster logic is not smashed, then the United States can send troops to Lebanon today because of 2,500 overseas citizens, and tomorrow it can send troops to other countries because of another several thousand or several hundred overseas citizens. How can the world be peaceful?

    Eisenhower also said that the US troops' occupation of Lebanon was to "assist the Lebanese government in maintaining its territorial integrity and political independence"; and said that the United States and the Lebanese traitorous government of Chamoun both "have the right to participate in collective security measures for self-defense," and that this action is a "inherent right" recognized by the United Nations Charter. This kind of sophistry is as shameless as the robbers who kill and loot claiming to be protecting the lives and property of the killed and robbed! Lebanon's territory was originally intact, and it only lost its integrity after the American troops invaded; Lebanon's politics were at least independent in form, and the Lebanese people's struggle against the Chamoun government was precisely to turn this formal independence into actual independence, and after the American troops invaded, even its original formal independence was completely destroyed. Eisenhower wants to seek help from the United Nations Charter, which only makes his flaws even bigger. According to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security." Does it give Eisenhower and Chamoun any right to American intervention in Lebanon here? Not a single bit! In Lebanon, there is no issue of being attacked by armed forces at all, but only a purely internal affair issue. This point was even proved by the reports of the United Nations observation group and United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld himself, who were sent to find a basis for intervening in Lebanon. Moreover, the US's dispatch of troops was not "until the Security Council has taken measures," but precisely after the Security Council took measures. If the American aggressors can manipulate the United Nations Charter and the Security Council in this way without being duly countered, then what difficulties will the United States have in sending armed forces into any country ruled by a traitorous government in the future?

    One of the most shameless excuses for American imperialism's肆行aggression against Lebanon is to describe the Lebanese people's armed struggle against the Chamoun clique and the Iraqi people's revolution to overthrow the Faisal feudal dynasty as "aggression" or "indirect aggression" against Lebanon and Iraq. He gave the following definition of his so-called "indirect aggression": "Under the guise of chaotic civil war, let those who are truly loyal to the aggressors take power in the country." To further explain his point of view, he also described the revolutionary struggles of the Greek people, the Czechoslovak people, the Chinese people, the Korean people and the Vietnamese people since World War II as examples of his so-called "indirect aggression."

    According to this statement, the problem in the Middle East now is: the Lebanese people invaded Lebanon, the Iraqi people invaded Iraq, just as the Greek people invaded Greece in the past, the Czechoslovak people invaded Slovakia, the Chinese people invaded China, the Korean people invaded Korea, and the Vietnamese people invaded Vietnam!

    This is truly a thorough piracy, even Hitler and Tojo did not invent such a robber logic!

    Eisenhower mentioned that many Americans have sacrificed their lives to maintain the independence of the country in the past. This is indeed a fact. But it is precisely here that Eisenhower insulted the ancestors of the American people. As everyone knows, in the 18th century, the people of the British colonies in North America, due to their resistance to British tyranny, held a fierce war of independence for six years (1775-1781), not only defeated their suzerain state Britain, but also crushed the "loyalists" within the colonies who supported the British king, thus giving birth to today's United States. However, according to Eisenhower's speech, then the conclusion can only be: the American people at that time not only invaded Britain, but also invaded the United States!

    The American Declaration of Independence of 1776 wrote: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness." May I ask Eisenhower and all participants and supporters of the Anglo-American aggression: Is the Declaration of Independence a communist propaganda? Was its drafting "actively incited by radio stations in the Soviet Union and Cairo"? But don't the people of the Middle East today ask for everything said in the Declaration of Independence? Why do Americans have the inalienable right to form a new government, while the people of Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq should be deprived of this right? Moreover, today's pro-Western rulers in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq are many times more isolated than the British rulers and pro-British rulers in the United States at that time. The New York Herald Tribune of July 8 said: "Most people in Lebanon openly or passively sympathize with the rebels." Even Eisenhower himself could not but mention in his speech that Chamoun had made it clear that he would not run for re-election because his reputation in Lebanon was too stinky. Hussein's rule in Jordan is also the same. On the contrary, the new government in Iraq has won the warm support of the people across the country, which all Western journalists in Baghdad have to admit. Since the facts are like this, what reason do the American aggressors have to forcibly prevent the people of these small countries from doing what their ancestors had already done two or three hundred years ago, and also slander the people of these small countries for carrying out "aggression"?

    There is no reason. The reason is because they are pirates, and they want to carry out lawless aggression. Whoever opposes their aggression, they will say is an aggressor or an indirect aggressor!

    What is particularly worth comparing is that the American War of Independence greatly relied on the assistance of foreign armed forces. The Americans who fought for independence sought assistance from Canada, Ireland, and France, and received significant military assistance from France, the Netherlands, and Spain. 90% of the weapons used in the first two and a half years of the War of Independence were shipped from Europe, especially from France. French and many other Europeans formed volunteer armies to participate in the war in the United States. And today, whether it is the struggle of the Lebanese people or the victory of the Iraqi people, it almost entirely depends on their own efforts. May I ask: Why don't they have the right to receive the international assistance that the American War of Independence received? Who dares to say that the French who aided the United States back then were aggressors, and that the Americans who asked for assistance were "people who are truly loyal to the aggressors"? History has drawn an unshakable conclusion: only the British who stubbornly hoped to maintain colonial rule and the Americans who stubbornly remained loyal to the British king were reactionaries, and those who overthrew these reactionaries were infinitely glorious and immortal revolutionary fighters. The unworthy descendants and shameful traitors of Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin, such as Eisenhower and Dulles, attempt to overthrow this historical conclusion, attempt to use force to protect the few imperialist running dogs among today's Arabs, and oppress and slander the millions of national warriors in the Middle East who are fighting for independence and freedom, but they can never reverse the wheels of history, but can only be crushed to pieces under the wheels of history and leave a bad name for ten thousand years.

    The Anglo-American aggressors not only completely violated the principles declared by their ancestors in the era of bourgeois revolution, but also completely violated the principles declared by the Anglo-American governments in World War II. In August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill jointly agreed in the famous Atlantic Charter: "They respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will लाइव; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprive of them." Why don't they respect the right of the people of the Middle East to choose the form of their government now? The United Nations Charter stipulates that: the purpose of the UN is to maintain international peace and security; member states should resolve their international disputes by peaceful means, and should not use threats or force in their international relations. What right do the Anglo-American aggressors have to tear up these basic principles of the United Nations? But according to Eisenhower's piracy logic, tearing up these principles is to "more fully support these principles"!

    When Eisenhower looked back on the world history from 1945 to 1950, he was full of hatred for the people of various countries. He said that the revolutions that took place in various countries at that time were all so-called "conquests" and "aggressions." We have already refuted this nonsense. Here, what is worth noting is not Eisenhower's mad hatred for the liberation struggles of the people of various countries, but his idiot-like ignorance of the inevitability of this development. He said that if the United States does not come out to carry out armed intervention, "the result will open the floodgates for the tide of direct and indirect aggression all over the world." Eisenhower made at least two mistakes: First, the United States has almost interfered in the liberation struggles of the people of various countries, especially in China and Korea, and it did not start from Lebanon; Second, as in the past, the US's military force can never become the gate to block the tide of people's liberation struggles in the future.

    Piracy is long out of date. No matter how many gunboats, planes, and atomic forces are dispatched, they cannot save the demise of the aggressors. Eisenhower and his like completely do not recognize today's era. For them, history is always full of incomprehensible sudden events. The development of the socialist revolutionary movement and the development of national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the two basic contents of human history in our era. This is the inevitable result of the development of capitalism to the stage of imperialism, and this is the logical development of the victory of the world anti-fascist war. The human race shed a lot of blood to defeat the German, Italian, and Japanese aggressors, not to continue to be slaves of imperialism and colonialism, not to let the American aggressors replace the German, Italian, and Japanese aggressors, or replace the British and French aggressors, and become the overlords of the world. The people of all countries in the world demand peace and progress, and all oppressed nations in the world demand independence and freedom. Under this situation, the liberation of the people of the Middle East is inevitable, and this point has already been pointed out by many sober-minded bourgeois figures in the United States and Britain. No matter whether the United States and Britain use force in the Middle East, or slander the people of the Middle East as aggressors, indirect aggressors, incited by the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic, and loyal to the aggressors, the trend of history cannot be changed by anyone. Contrary to the wishes of the pirates, the more they expose their vicious faces, the more they promote the awakening and unity of the people. If they insist on imposing war on the people of all countries, then, as the past history has repeatedly proved, this can only promote their demise and the victory of the people!

### 艾森豪威尔的旗帜就是海盗的旗帜

    艾森豪威尔的旗帜就是海盗的旗帜
    艾森豪威尔在7月15日向美国人民发表的演说，其主要论点后来也被麦克米伦、劳埃德所重复，可以说是美英侵略者对中东实行武装干涉的一个纲领。全世界爱好和平和自由的人民不能不认识这个纲领。
    艾森豪威尔的演说提出了一套证明侵略者可以任意摧毁各国的民族独立、任意剥夺各国人民行使主权的权利的强盗逻辑。按照这种逻辑，美国武装力量可以对于任何国家进行侵略，可以霸占全世界。这是一个威胁世界和平的纲领，一个实行战争动员的纲领。
    艾森豪威尔说美国军队侵占黎巴嫩是为了“美国的福利”，为了“保卫美国人的生命”，因为“在黎巴嫩大约有两千五百名美国人”。但是，这显然不能成为向外国出兵的根据。世界上一切国家都有自己的“福利”，多数国家都有侨民在外国，按照艾森豪威尔，岂不是大家都可以互相出兵了吗？况且，在黎巴嫩根本不存在什么对于美国侨民的威胁。人们知道，希特勒在1936年7月对西班牙进行武装干涉的时候，就是说为了要“保护德国人的生命财产”，这同艾森豪威尔的所谓“保卫美国人的生命”的说法一模一样。日本在1931年、1932年和1937年侵略中国的时候，也曾经利用同样的借口。这种强盗的逻辑如果不加以粉碎，那么，美国今天可以因为二千五百名侨民出兵黎巴嫩，明天它就可以因为另外的几千名几百名侨民出兵到别的国家。这样，世界还能有安宁吗？
    艾森豪威尔又说，美国军队侵占黎巴嫩是为了“协助黎巴嫩政府维护它的领土完整和政治独立”；并且说，美国和黎巴嫩的夏蒙卖国政府都“有权参加关于自卫的集体安全措施”，而这种行动是联合国宪章所承认的“固有的权利”。这种诡辩简直同杀人越货的强盗自称是为了保障被杀被劫者的生命财产的安全一样无耻！黎巴嫩的领土本来是完整的，只是在美国军队侵入以后才丧失完整；黎巴嫩的政治本来至少在形式上是独立的，黎巴嫩人民反对夏蒙政府的斗争正是为了把这种形式的独立变为实际的独立，而在美国军队侵入以后，就连它原有的形式上的独立也被彻底破坏了。艾森豪威尔想求援于联合国宪章，这只是使他的破绽更加扩大。按照联合国宪章第五十一条，“联合国任何会员国受武力攻击时，在安全理事会采取必要办法，以维持国际和平及安全以前，本宪章不得认为禁止行使或集体自卫之固有权利。”这里难道给了艾森豪威尔和夏蒙以美国干涉黎巴嫩的任何权利吗？一丝一毫也没有！在黎巴嫩，根本不存在受武力攻击的问题，而只有纯粹的内政问题。这一点，甚至为了寻找干涉黎巴嫩的根据而派出的联合国观察团和联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德本人的报告都作了证明。而且，美国的出兵也不是“在安全理事会采取办法以前”，恰恰是在安全理事会采取办法以后。美国侵略者如果可以如此玩弄联合国宪章和安全理事会而不受到应有的反击，那么，美国今后把武装部队开入任何一个由卖国政府统治的国家，又还有什么困难呢？
    美国帝国主义对黎巴嫩肆行侵略的一个最无耻的借口，就是把黎巴嫩人民反对夏蒙集团的武装斗争和伊拉克人民推翻费萨尔封建王朝的革命，说成是对黎巴嫩和伊拉克的“侵略”或“间接侵略”。他对他所谓的“间接侵略”下了一个如下的定义，那就是：“在纷乱的内战掩饰下，让那些真正忠于侵略者的人在国内当权。”为了进一步解释他的观点，他还把世界第二次大战以来的希腊人民、捷克斯洛伐克人民、中国人民、朝鲜人民和越南人民所进行的革命斗争，都说成他所谓的“间接侵略”的例子。
    按照这说法，现在中东的问题是：黎巴嫩人民侵略了黎巴嫩，伊拉克人民侵略了伊拉克，正如过去希腊人民侵略了希腊，捷克斯洛伐克人民侵略了斯洛伐克，中国人民侵略了中国，朝鲜人民侵略了朝鲜，越南人民侵略了越南一样！
    这真正是一种彻底的海盗主义，甚至希特勒和东条都没有发明出这样一种强盗的逻辑！
    艾森豪威尔提到过去许多美国人曾经为维护国家的独立而牺牲自己的生命。这的确是事实。但是正是在这里，艾森豪威尔侮辱了美国人民的祖先。大家知道，在十八世纪，在北美的英国殖民地的人民由于反抗英国的暴政，曾经举行了六年（1775—1781）的激烈的独立战争，不但战胜了自己的宗主国英国，而且，粉碎了殖民地内部的拥护英王的“效忠派”，从而产生了今天的美国。但是，根据艾森豪威尔的演说，那么，结论只能是：当时的美国人民既侵略了英国，又侵略了美国！
    1776年的美国独立宣言写道：“人是生而平等的，他们被造物主赋与某些不可让渡的权利，其中包括生存、自由、追求幸福等权利。为了确实保障这些权利，人民建立了政府，它们的权力是由于被统治者的同意产生出来的。当任何形式的政体妨害了这种目的时，人民有权力去改变它，或废除它，人民有权力成立新政府，它必须建立在最能保证人民的安全和幸福的原则上，其政权组织的形式也要以此为依归。”试问艾森豪威尔和美英侵略行为的一切参加者支持者：难道独立宣言是共产党的宣传吗？难道它的起草是“苏联和开罗的广播所积极煽动起来的”吗？但是，难道今天的中东人民不正是要求独立宣言中所说的一切吗？为什么美国人有成立新政府的不可让渡的权利，而黎巴嫩、约旦、伊拉克的人民就应该被剥夺这个权利？而且，今天的黎巴嫩、约旦、伊拉克的亲西方的统治者，比当时在美国的英国统治者和亲英国的统治者不知更要孤立多少倍。7月8日的纽约先驱论坛报说：“黎巴嫩大多数人都公开或消极地同情叛乱分子。”甚至艾森豪威尔本人在演说中也不能不提到，夏蒙已经明白表示他不竞选连任，因为他的名声在黎巴嫩已经太臭了。侯赛因在约旦的统治也是如此。相反，伊拉克的新政府却获得了全国人民的热烈支持，这是巴格达的一切西方新闻记者都不得不承认的。事实既然如此，美国侵略者究竟有什么理由硬要用武力来禁止这些小国的人民实行他们的祖先在二三百年前就已经作过的事情，还要污蔑这些小国的人民在实行“侵略”呢？
    没有任何理由。理由就是因为他们是海盗，他们要实行无法无天的侵略。谁要反对他们的侵略，他们就说谁是侵略者或者间接的侵略者！
    值得特别加以比较的是：美国的独立战争曾经大大依靠外国武力的援助。争取独立的美国人曾经向加拿大、爱尔兰、法国求援，并且从法国、荷兰、西班牙得到了重大的军事援助。独立战争中头两年半所使用的武器90％都是从欧洲特别是从法国运来的。法国人和其他许多欧洲人曾经组成志愿军到美国参战。而在今天，无论黎巴嫩人民的斗争，或是伊拉克人民的胜利，却几乎完全依靠本身的努力。试问：为什么他们没有权利得到美国独立战争所得到过的国际援助呢？谁敢说当年援助美国的法国人是侵略者，而要求援助的美国人是“真正忠于侵略者的人”呢？历史作了不能动摇的结论：只有顽固地希望保持殖民统治的英国人和顽固地效忠于英王的美国人才是反动派，而打倒这些反动派的人乃是无限光荣的永垂不朽的革命战士。华盛顿、杰斐孙、佛兰克林的不肖子孙和可耻叛徒艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流企图推翻这个历史结论，企图用武力保护今天的阿拉伯人中的少数帝国主义走狗，而压迫和污蔑中东的争取独立自由的千百万民族战士，但是他们决不能扭转历史的车轮，而只能在历史的车轮下面粉身碎骨，遗臭万年。
    美英侵略者不但完全违反他们的资产阶级革命时代的祖先所宣布的原则，而且完全违反美英政府在世界第二次大战中所宣布的原则。1941年8月，罗斯福和丘吉尔在著名的大西洋宪章中曾经共同约定：“两国尊重一切人民选择其生活所在之政府的形式之权利，凡主权及自治业已横遭剥夺者，两国愿睹其恢复。”现在他们为什么不尊重中东人民选择其政府的形式之权利呢？联合国宪章规定：联合国的宗旨就在于维持国际和平及安全；各会员国应以和平方法解决其国际争端，在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力。美英侵略者有什么权利撕毁联合国的这些基本原则呢？但是按照艾森豪威尔的海盗主义的逻辑，撕毁这些原则却是为了“更加充分地支持这些原则”！
    艾森豪威尔在回顾1945年到1950年的世界历史的时候，充满了对各国人民的仇恨，他说当时各国发生的革命都是所谓“征服”和“侵略”。这种无稽之谈我们已经驳斥过了。在这里，值得注意的还不是艾森豪威尔对各国人民的解放斗争的疯狂的仇恨，而是他对于这种发展的必然性竟然像白痴一样地无知。他说什么如果美国不出来进行武装干涉，“结果将会为全世界各地的直接和间接侵略的潮水打开闸门”。艾森豪威尔至少犯了两点错误：第一，美国对于各国人民的解放斗争几乎都是干涉过的，在中国和朝鲜干涉得尤其拼命，并不是从黎巴嫩开始；第二，同过去一样，美国的武力在今后也决不能够成为拦住人民解放斗争的潮水的闸门。
    海盗主义早已过时了。无论出动多少炮舰、飞机、原子部队，决不能挽救侵略者的灭亡。艾森豪威尔之流完全不认识今天的时代。对于他们，历史总是充满了难以理解的突然事变。社会主义革命运动的发展，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族独立运动的发展，是我们这个时代的人类历史的两个基本的内容。这是资本主义发展到帝国主义阶段的必然结果，这是世界反法西斯战争胜利的逻辑发展。人类流了大量鲜血战胜德意日侵略者，决不是为了继续再当帝国主义和殖民主义的奴隶，决不是为了让美国侵略者代替德意日侵略者，或者代替英法侵略者，而成为世界的霸主。世界各国的人民群众要求和平和进步，世界上所有的被压迫民族要求独立和自由。在这个形势下面，中东人民的解放是必然的，这一点美英两国许多头脑清醒的资产阶级人士都已经指出了。无论美国和英国在中东使用武力也罢，污蔑中东人民是侵略者、间接侵略者、受了苏联和阿联的煽动、忠于侵略者也罢，历史的潮流是谁也改变不了的。同海盗们的愿望相反，他们越是露出凶恶的面目，就越发促进人民的觉悟和团结。如果他们硬要把战争强加在各国人民的头上，那么，像过去的历史所再三证明了的一样，这也只能促进他们的灭亡和人民的胜利！
