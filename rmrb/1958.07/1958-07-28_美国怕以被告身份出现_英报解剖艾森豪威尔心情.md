Xinhua News Agency, London, July 27th: TASS reports: U.S. President Eisenhower’s reply to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's letter was the subject of commentary in British newspapers on the 26th.

From the comments in many newspapers, it can be seen that differences have arisen between the U.S. and British governments. The United States is eagerly pulling its partners back, as it usually does, immediately retreating as soon as the Soviet government accepts Western proposals. The "Daily Mail" commentator Wakeford said that some Western diplomats believe that Eisenhower's sending a reply before the British government was a "blow to Macmillan." He said: "Therefore, yesterday (the 25th), some concluded that a 'fight for the leading position' has occurred." This commentator also pointed out that London diplomatic circles predict that Dulles' negotiations in London (he will arrive here today) on this issue "will be of a sharp nature."

The "Manchester Guardian" expressed doubt about whether the U.S. response was "sensible." The newspaper believes that the U.S. President is very afraid of attending the high-level meeting to discuss the Near East situation, primarily because the U.S. government fears appearing as a "defendant" at the meeting along with Britain.

As for Britain's attitude, the "Manchester Guardian" said: "The Suez incident was a painful lesson for Britain." The newspaper believes that this is the reason why the opposition exerted pressure on the government in the House of Commons and why Macmillan later suggested holding a summit meeting within the framework of the Security Council.

    美国怕以被告身份出现
    英报解剖艾森豪威尔心情
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔对苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫信件的答复，是26日英国报纸评论的主题。
    从许多报纸的评论中可以看出：美英两国政府之间发生了分歧。美国在迫不及待地拉它的伙伴的后腿，像往常一样一等到苏联政府接受西方的建议，它自己就马上缩回去。“每日邮报”评论员韦克弗德说，某些西方国家的外交家认为，艾森豪威尔在英国政府之前就寄出复信，这是对“麦克米伦的打击”。他说：“因此，昨天（25日）有人得出这样的结论：一场‘争取领先地位’的斗争已发生了。”这个评论员还指出，伦敦外交界人士预测，杜勒斯在伦敦（他今天将到达这里）就这个问题的谈判“将具有尖锐的性质”。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”对美国的答复是否“理智”表示怀疑。报纸认为，美国总统面临这个讨论近东局势的高级会议感到很害怕，这首先是因为美国政府害怕将同英国一起在这个会议上以“被告”身份出现。
    至于英国的态度，“曼彻斯特卫报”说：“苏伊士事件对英国来说是一个惨痛的经验教训。”报纸认为，这是反对派在下院对政府施行压力和后来麦克米伦建议在安全理事会范围内举行政府首脑会议的原因。
