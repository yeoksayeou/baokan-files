Sealing small denomination coins is a cumbersome process and one of the difficulties faced by bank tellers. Zou Zhonghua of the Wusheng County Branch of the Bank of China in Sichuan Province has created a coin sealing device. A small iron roller is installed on a small wooden box. The coins are placed on paper, clipped on both ends, and secured to the sealing device. By pulling the roller, the coins can be sealed quickly and tightly. In the past, it took 18 seconds to seal 100 coins by hand. With this sealing device, it only takes 6 seconds, increasing efficiency by two times.

    封包硬币不用手
    硬分币的包装的手续繁多，是银行出纳人员碰到的困难之一。四川省武胜县支行邹忠华创造了一种硬币封包器，在一个不大的木盒上安了一根小铁滚，把硬分币放在纸上两头夹好卡在封包器上，把滚筒一拉，硬币便封得又快、又紧。过去用手工封一百枚硬币需要十八秒钟，用这种封包器只需要六秒钟，提高效率两倍。
