Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd. The Min-Dian Railway, spanning the five provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, has now begun construction. The Railway Engineering Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the main force in building this large railway. They have adopted the method of surveying and designing in sections and constructing in sections, and have started construction on several sections successively.

This large railway, running from the southeast coast of China to the southwest, known as the "Jiangnan Longhai Line," has a total length of approximately 2,900 kilometers. It will consist of the future Min-Gan Line, Xiang-Gan Line, Xiang-Qian Line, Dian-Qian Line, and the Kunming-Dali Line, and is one of the important projects of China's Second Five-Year Plan for railway construction. This railway starts from Quanzhou, Fujian, passes through Zhangping, enters the old revolutionary base area of western Fujian, which has held the red flag for twenty years, and the central Soviet area during the Second Revolutionary Civil War; passes through Ruijin, the "Red Capital," turns northwest in Ganzhou, crosses the Wugong Mountains, and connects with the Beijing-Guangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Xiang-Gui lines in Zhuzhou, Hunan; going west, it passes through Chairman Mao's hometown of Xiangtan, then crosses the Xuefeng Mountains, spans the Zi and Yuan rivers, runs along the edge of the minority areas of western Hunan, and climbs onto the Guizhou-Yunnan Plateau; then it connects with the Qian-Gui Line in Duyun, and in Guiyang, it connects with the Sichuan-Guizhou Line currently under construction; going west to Rongfeng, Yunnan, it connects with the Nei-Kun Line; then it goes south through Zhanyi to Kunming, and then heads west-northwest to Dali as its final destination. Except for the section from Zhuting to Xiangtan on the Beijing-Guangzhou Line which already has a railway, the section from Zhanyi to Kunming which needs to be re-railed (narrow gauge changed to broad gauge), and the section from Duyun to Guiyang which is being built by the Railway Engineering Bureau, all the rest will be newly built by the Railway Engineering Corps. This large railway is a horizontal trunk line connecting the southeast and southwest regions of China and is an important part of the future national railway network.

The section from Zhangping to Longyan in western Fujian started construction in mid-June, and the road-building officers and soldiers and civilian workers are determined to complete the track laying by March next year. On the section from Longyan to Ganzhou, veteran Red Army soldiers and local farmers familiar with the situation are currently vigorously assisting the surveyors in their work. The sections from Xiangtan to Duyun in Hunan and from Rongfeng to Zhanyi in Yunnan have also recently started construction. At present, a large number of Railway Engineering Corps troops are coming from all over to various lines and sections, preparing for large-scale construction. Many veteran Red Army soldiers who had walked through many places along the line during the Long March are now back here to direct the Railway Engineering Corps in building the railway, and they are particularly excited.

The Min-Dian Railway will pass through the rugged terrain, undulating mountains, and crisscrossing rivers of the southeastern hilly area, and the towering peaks, steep cliffs, and deep valleys of the Guizhou-Yunnan Plateau. The number of tunnels and bridges along the line will be more than any other railway in China. There are approximately six hundred tunnels along the line, with a total length of 170 kilometers; 25 of them are over 1,000 meters long; the longest is more than 3,900 meters long, which is more than 1,500 meters longer than China's current longest tunnel, the Qinling Tunnel. The total length of large, medium, and small bridges along the line is approximately 40 kilometers, and some bridges need to be built more than 50 meters high. On one section of more than 130 kilometers on the Guizhou-Yunnan Plateau alone, 36 kilometers of tunnels and 7 kilometers of bridges need to be built. This is rare in the history of railway construction in China and the world.

The area through which this east-west horizontal trunk line passes has fertile land, rich in grain and various cash crops, and contains rich mineral resources. For example, southern Fujian, southern Jiangxi, and central Hunan are areas in China that are rich in rice production. Ramie in Jiangxi and the Xiang and Yuan river basins, tung oil and tea in western Hunan, medicinal materials in Yunnan and Guizhou, sugar cane in southern Fujian, and shiitake mushrooms in western Fujian are all well-known throughout the country. The forest reserves along the line are very large. Fujian, Hunan, and Yunnan are all major forest areas in China. Southern Jiangxi is known as the "Jiangxi Tree Sea," and Guizhou has always been known as the "Mountainous Country Suitable for Forests." There are many minerals along the line such as iron, coal, tin, tungsten, antimony, lead, manganese, copper, and aluminum. The construction of this railway is of great significance for developing mineral resources, further developing local industry, and promoting the economic prosperity of minority areas.

This newspaper reports: After some units of the Railway Engineering Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army accepted the task of building the Min-Dian Railway spanning five provinces in the south of the Yangtze River, all officers, soldiers and staff were overjoyed and inspired. The troops that have entered the construction site are working with the local laborers, and the tense construction has begun. The troops still on other tasks are working even harder, and strive to complete the task as soon as possible and go to the new construction site.

A certain unit responsible for the Rongfeng to Zhanyi section in Yunnan Province of the Min-Dian Line officially started construction in early June. This section of the railway meanders between the mountains, and the project is very difficult. From Tangzi to Qujing, a section of only 70 kilometers, there are seven large bridges and five tunnels, and the highest of the bridges is 41 meters. However, the officers and soldiers of the construction troops are inspired by the arduous tasks. With the heroic spirit of "high mountains and dangerous waters can't stop the heroes," they launched a fierce attack on the stubborn rocks.

A certain unit that is still performing tasks on the Baotou-Lanzhou Line was excited when it received the task of building roads in Xiangtan, the hometown of Chairman Mao. Wang Jianxia, the political director of the unit, said: "We are determined to advance the task of the Baotou-Lanzhou Line ahead of schedule and strive to enter the new construction site as soon as possible. Guarantee that the track will be laid from Xiangtan to Loudi by the end of this year." Now, the advance troops have entered the new work area and started construction while surveying and designing. The section from Rongfeng to Weining is the most difficult section of this railway, with four large tunnels ranging from 2,000 meters to 3,900 meters. The unit responsible for this arduous project is the unit that once opened the Daheshan Tunnel on the Yingxia Railway. Luo Chongfu, the colonel and division commander of a certain division of Red Army soldiers who went through the 25,000-mile Long March, has led the advance troops to Rongfeng to begin the survey work of the entire section. Zhang Mingwan, the sergeant squad leader who created the highest record of rock drilling in the Daheshan Tunnel and is a national advanced producer, said: "It is not enough to rely on manpower alone to complete such a large project. We must improve technology, innovate technology, and replace manpower with machinery. I want to create a silica-producing machine to replace manual silica production. Under the illumination of the general line, we must mobilize our comrades to engage in technological innovation on a large scale, and build railways in a faster, better, and more economical way. We must open up these large tunnels ahead of schedule." (Manuscript provided by Railway Engineering Corps News)

    横贯五省全长近三千公里的“江南陇海线”
    闽滇大铁路动工修建
    解放军铁道兵部队担当修路主力军
    新华社3日讯　横贯福建、江西、湖南、贵州、云南等五省的闽滇大铁路，现已开始动工修建。中国人民解放军铁道兵部队，是修建这条大铁路的主力军。他们已采取分段勘测、分段施工的办法，先后在几个段上动工。
    这条从我国东南沿海通向大西南的、被称为“江南陇海线”的大铁路，全长共约二千九百多公里，将由未来的闽赣线、湘赣线、湘黔线、滇黔线和由昆明到大理线组成，是我国第二个五年计划铁路建设的重要工程之一。这条铁路东起福建泉州，经过漳平，进入二十年红旗不倒的闽西革命根据地和第二次国内革命战争时期的中央苏区；通过红都瑞金，在赣州折向西北，穿过武功山脉，至湖南株洲跟京广、浙赣、湘桂线接通；向西经过毛主席的故乡湘潭，再穿过雪峰山，跨过资、沅二水，沿着湘西少数民族地区边缘，爬上云贵高原；然后在都匀跟黔桂线相接，到了贵阳，又跟目前正在兴修的川黔线接通；往西到云南榕峰，又跟内昆线连接起来；再南下经沾益、到昆明，而后向西偏北挺进，一直到大理为终点。全线除京广线上的朱亭到湘潭一段已有铁路，沾益到昆明一段需要重行铺轨（窄轨改为宽轨），以及都匀到贵阳一段由铁路工程局修建以外，全部由铁道兵新建。这条大铁路是沟通我国东南和西南地区的横向大干线，是未来全国铁路网的重要组成部分。
    闽西漳平到龙岩一段，已于6月中旬开工，筑路官兵和民工决心在明年3月铺轨完毕。在龙岩到赣州段上，当年的老红军战士和当地熟悉情况的农民，目前正大力协助勘测人员进行工作。湖南湘潭到都匀段和云南榕峰到沾益段，最近也已动工。目前，大批铁道兵部队正从各地源源开赴各线、各段，准备大规模地施工。许多当年长征时曾经走过沿线许多地方的红军老战士，现在又回到这里指挥铁道兵建设铁路，心情都特别兴奋。
    闽滇大铁路将穿过地形崎岖、山峦起伏、河流纵横的东南丘陵地带，和奇峰高耸、峭壁深谷的云贵高原，沿线的隧道、桥梁要比我国任何一条铁路都多。全线隧道约有六百余座，总长一百七十公里；长度在一千公尺以上的达二十五座；最长的有三千九百多公尺，比我国现有最长的隧道——秦岭隧道还长一千五百多公尺。全线大、中、小桥梁总长约四十公里，有的桥要筑五十多公尺高。仅在云贵高原上的一段一百三十多公里的线路上，就要修三十六公里长的隧道和七公里长的桥梁。这在我国和世界铁路建筑史上是罕见的。
    这条东西横向大干线所经之处，土地肥沃，盛产粮食和各种经济作物，并蕴藏着丰富的矿产。如闽南、赣南、湘中，都是我国盛产水稻地区。江西以及湘、沅两水流域的苎麻，湘西的桐油和茶叶，云、贵药材，闽南甘蔗和闽西香菇，都闻名全国。沿线的森林储量很大，福建、湖南、云南都是我国主要林区之一，赣南有“江西树海”之称，贵州也素有“宜林山国”之名。沿线矿产如铁、煤、锡、钨、锑、铅、锰、铜、铝等都很多。这条铁路的修建，对于开发矿产、进一步发展地方工业以及促进少数民族地区的经济繁荣，都具有重大意义。
    本报讯　中国人民解放军铁道兵部分部队接受了横贯江南五省的闽滇大铁路的修建任务后，所有官兵和职工，个个欢欣鼓舞，精神奋发。已进入工地的部队正和当地的民工一道，开始了紧张的施工；尚在担任其他任务的部队，更在加倍努力，力争早日完成任务，开赴新工地。
    担任闽滇线云南境内的榕峰至沾益段的某部队已在6月上旬正式动工。这一段铁路蜿蜒在群山之间，工程十分艰巨，仅从塘子到曲靖，不过七十公里的一段，就有七座大桥，五座隧道，桥梁最高的达四十一公尺。但是，施工部队的官兵被艰巨的任务所激发，他们以“山高水险挡不住英雄好汉”的豪迈气魄，向顽石展开了猛烈的进攻。
    目前还正在包兰线执行任务的某部队，接到毛主席家乡湘潭一带修路的任务后，个个振奋，部队政治主任王剑霞中校说：“我们决心把包兰线的任务提前再提前，争取早日进入新工地。保证今年年底从湘潭铺轨到楼底。”现在，先头部队已进入新工区，并在勘测设计的同时，开始动工。榕峰到威宁段是这条铁路最艰巨的一段，其中两千公尺到三千九百公尺的大隧道有四座，担任这段艰巨工程的是曾经在鹰厦铁路开凿大禾山大隧道的部队，经过二万五千里长征的红军战士、某师师长罗崇富上校已率领先头部队抵达榕峰，开始全段的勘测工作。在大禾山隧道创造了钻岩最高纪录的全国先进生产者、中士班长张明万
  说：“完成这样大的工程单靠人工是不够的，必须提高技术、革新技术，用机械代替人工，我就想搞个出硅机代替人力出硅。在总路线的照耀下，我们要发动同志们大搞技术革新，多快好省地修建铁路，一定要提前打通这些大隧道。”（铁道兵报供稿）
