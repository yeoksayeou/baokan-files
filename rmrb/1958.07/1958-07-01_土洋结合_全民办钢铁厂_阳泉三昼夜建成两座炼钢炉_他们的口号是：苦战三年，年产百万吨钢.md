    Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods, The Whole People Runs Steel Plants
    Yangquan Builds Two Steel Furnaces in Three Days and Nights
    Their Slogan is: Fight Bitterly for Three Years, Annual Production of One Million Tons of Steel
    According to the Shanxi Daily: The people of Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, after three days and nights of hard work, have already built two steel furnaces on June 18th, smelting the first furnace of steel in Yangquan's history. At the same time, they produced a small rolling mill and rolled out the first sixteen-millimeter steel bar. At the same time, seven small iron-smelting blast furnaces in the city have been put into production. They plan to increase the production capacity of pig iron to 400,000 tons this year, ensuring the production of 200,000 tons of pig iron this year; and build steelmaking equipment with a production capacity of 300,000 tons of steel, ensuring the production of 100,000 tons of steel this year. The action slogan of the city's people is: Fight bitterly for three years to achieve an annual output of one million tons of steel.
    On June 14th, the Yangquan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an emergency meeting. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, it re-deployed the city's industrial construction, deciding to take the steel industry as the key to the city's development of local industries and launch a city-wide upsurge of the whole party and the whole people running the steel industry. The Municipal Party Committee established a general headquarters for factory construction, headed by Chen Ziwan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Municipal Party Committee, to lead the city's factory construction work. The city established a support and collaboration network, and according to the factory construction method of large factories contracting to build small factories and several units jointly contracting to build a large factory, formed a number of collaboration zones. Each collaboration zone established a headquarters. That night, each unit held discussions and prepared for factory construction. On the 15th, fifteen blast furnaces and two steel furnaces in the city started construction simultaneously.
    In running the steel industry on a large scale, Yangquan City adhered to the policy of the whole party and the whole people running steel, combining large, medium, and small scales, and combining foreign and indigenous methods. The slogan put forward by the Municipal Party Committee is: Where there is iron ore, build a blast furnace to smelt iron; where there is a blast furnace, build a steel furnace to smelt steel; enterprises that need steel and have the conditions to build their own steel plants. Of the fifty-one blast furnaces and fifteen steel furnaces planned to be newly built in the city this year, more than 80% are self-built by handicraft cooperatives and various enterprises, without the need for state investment. Among the newly built steel industries this year, the largest are modern blast furnaces with a volume of 200 cubic meters and steel furnaces with an annual output of 130,000 tons, and the smallest are indigenous blast furnaces with a volume of 3 cubic meters and indigenous steel furnaces with a daily output of 3 tons of steel.

    土洋结合　全民办钢铁厂
    阳泉三昼夜建成两座炼钢炉
    他们的口号是：苦战三年，年产百万吨钢
    据山西日报报道：山西省阳泉市人民经过三昼夜的苦战，已经在6月18日建成了两座炼钢炉，炼出了阳泉有史以来的第一炉钢；同时制成了小型轧钢机，轧出了第一根十六米厘的钢材。与此同时，全市有七座小型炼铁高炉投入了生产。他们计划今年要把生铁的生产能力增加到四十万吨，保证今年生产出二十万吨生铁；新建起生产三十万吨钢的炼钢设备，保证今年生产出十万吨钢。全市人民的行动口号是：苦战三年，达到年产百万吨钢。
    6月14日，中共阳泉市委召开紧急会议，根据省委的指示，对全市的工业建设重新作了部署，决定把钢铁工业作为全市发展地方工业之纲，在全市范围内掀起一个全党全民办钢铁工业的热潮。市委成立了建厂总指挥部，由市委书记处书记陈子万挂帅，领导全市的建厂工作；全市成立了支援协作网，根据大厂包建小厂、几个单位联合包建一个大厂的建厂方法，组成了若干协作区；各个协作区都成立了指挥部，当天晚上，各单位又进行了讨论，作好了建厂准备。15日这天，全市有十五个高炉和两个炼钢炉同时开工。
    阳泉市在大办钢铁工业中，坚持了全党全民办钢铁，大中小结合，洋土并举的方针。市委提出的口号是：有铁矿的地方就建高炉炼铁，有高炉的地方就建钢炉炼钢，需要钢铁而又有条件的企业自己建设钢铁厂。全市今年预计新建设的五十一座高炉和十五座炼钢炉中，80％以上是由手工业社和各企业自办，不需要国家投资。在今年新建的钢铁工业中，最大的有二百立方的近代化高炉和年产量达十三万吨的炼钢炉，最小的有三立方的土高炉和日产三吨钢的土炼钢炉。
