    This Matter Should Be Promoted
    Tian Lianqian
    The establishment of public canteens and collective dining by some agricultural cooperatives in Hunan, Fujian and other places is a new and meaningful development in rural areas. It marks a new development and trend in the living habits and lifestyles of farmers. In the era of individual economy, each farmer's household was a production unit. Adapting to this decentralized individual economic system, meals were also prepared in each household. Now the situation is completely different: the vast rural areas have already been cooperativized, and production is no longer carried out on a family basis, but on a cooperative basis. The large-scale production and construction movement and the widespread technical reform movement have placed the vast rural areas in a constant state of intense shock, and labor is generally felt to be insufficient. Collective production and intense labor inevitably require a corresponding lifestyle and habits. The development from one household and one stove to public canteens is a reflection of this requirement. The rural nurseries, as well as sewing and milling organizations, which have been introduced in newspapers, have also arisen to meet the requirements of large-scale collective production.
    There are many benefits to running public canteens, which can be summarized in two aspects: on the one hand, it increases the number of production laborers and production labor time. A large number of women can be freed from the tedious tasks of firewood, rice, oil, and salt and投入into production labor. The production labor time of single men can also be increased because of the canteen. The dining time of ordinary laborers is consistent, which can save time wasted waiting for each other during production. On the other hand, it is very beneficial to improving the relationship between people, especially between family members. The quarrels that used to occur over cooking and eating will be greatly reduced, and people's unity will be strengthened. People's wisdom, freed from the shackles of individual life, will inevitably develop towards collective undertakings and culture and politics. This will inevitably promote technological and cultural revolutions.
    Based on the situation of public canteens in various places, we believe that this is a progressive thing and should be promoted. However, because Chinese farmers have lived in small family circles for thousands of years, they may have various concerns about public canteens. Therefore, it is necessary to explain the policies and specific practices to the farmers in detail when running them in various places. It is said that some farmers in some places mistakenly believe that public canteens are the so-called "big pot rice," and before joining the canteen, they stepped up squandering and wasting their own grain reserves, and even invited relatives and friends to eat and drink extravagantly. This shows that they do not yet understand the rationale for running public canteens. In the future, this phenomenon must be eliminated by intensifying education.

    这件事要提倡
    田连阡
    湖南、福建等地一些农业社开办公共食堂，集体吃饭，是一件很有意义的农村新事。它标志着农民生活习惯和生活方式上的新发展，新趋向。在个体经济时代，农民一家一户就是一个生产单位。适应着这种分散的个体经济制度，吃饭也是一家一灶。现在情况完全不同了：广大农村已经合作化，生产再不是以家庭为单位，而是以社为单位在进行。大规模的生产建设运动和广泛开展着的技术改革运动，使广大农村经常处于紧张的突击状态，劳动力普遍感到不足。集体的生产和紧张的劳动，必然要求有同它相适应的生活方式，生活习惯。由一家一灶发展成为公共食堂，正是这种要求的反映。报纸上介绍过的农村托儿所，以及缝衣和磨面的组织，也都是适应集体大生产的要求而产生的。
    开办公共食堂好处很多，归结起来有两个方面：一方面，是增加了生产劳动者和生产劳动时间。大量的妇女可以从烦琐的柴米油盐中解放出来，投入生产劳动。单身汉子的生产劳动时间也因为有了食堂而可以增加。一般劳动者吃饭时间一致了，就可以省得在生产时你等我，我等你，耽误时间。另一方面，是对改善人与人的关系，尤其是家庭内部成员之间的关系，大有好处。从前在做饭和吃饭问题上发生的争吵将大大减少，人们的团结将日益加强。人们的智慧从个体生活的束缚中解放出来了，就必然向集体事业和文化、政治方面发展。这对技术革命和文化革命也必然会发生推动作用。
    根据各地举办公共食堂的情况，我们认为这是一个进步的东西，应该提倡。但是，由于我国农民几千年来一直是生活在小小的家庭圈子里，对公共食堂可能会有这样那样的一些疑虑。所以各地在兴办时一定要详细地向农民群众交代政策和具体做法。据说，有的地方有些农民误认为公共食堂就是所谓“大锅饭”，在参加食堂以前就加紧挥霍浪费自己家里的存粮，甚至请亲戚朋友来大吃大喝。这说明他们还不了解举办公共食堂的道理。今后必须用加紧教育的方法来消除这种现象。
