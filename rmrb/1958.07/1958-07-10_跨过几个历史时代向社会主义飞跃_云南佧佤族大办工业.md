Leaping Across Several Historical Eras to Socialism

The Va People of Yunnan Vigorously Develop Industry

(Reported by our correspondent Wang Chuan Guo) In the era of the great leap forward in the motherland, the ethnic minorities in the Va Mountains of Yunnan Province are leaping across several historical eras and vigorously developing industry. The total industrial output value will exceed the total agricultural output value this year.

Not long ago, the Va people, who were in a primitive state, only knew how to cultivate a few dry land crops by the "slash-and-burn" method, and did not even have the simplest handicrafts. The means of production, daily necessities, and non-staple foods they needed were all transported from the interior over long distances. You couldn’t find anything locally produced in the market. Now, the stores already have fifty or sixty kinds of products manufactured or processed by local factories. Agricultural tools such as plows, hoes, and machetes, as well as ethnic costumes, have stopped being transferred from other places and can be self-sufficient locally. With the establishment of pottery factories, the wooden bowls and bamboo tubes that the Va people have used for a long time will soon be replaced by pottery bowls, plates, cups, and jars.

The industry in the Va Mountains was established under the leadership of the Party and with the selfless assistance of advanced ethnic groups. In February and March of this year, when neighboring Simao, Puer, and Mojiang counties learned that the Va people wanted to develop industry, they immediately drew manpower and material resources to provide comprehensive support. The higher-level leading organs also specially issued instructions: the nearby counties should take responsibility for supporting the construction of the Va Mountains. Subsequently, the Sipu Iron Plant sent ironmaking workers, and Mojiang also transferred pottery workers. With their help, the Va Mountains quickly established iron plants, lead plants, and pottery factories. When the Simao Iron Factory heard that the Va people wanted to expand the farm tool factory, they took the initiative to express their willingness to provide machinery and skilled workers. Lancang allocated 30,000 yuan in funds to the Va Mountains even when the county's finances were relatively tight. The Lancang Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also specifically dispatched a work team to visit local experts among the Han and Lahu people in the countryside, and organized a group of technical talents to participate in the construction of the Va Mountains.

The selfless assistance of the advanced ethnic groups in the interior greatly encouraged the Va people. The Ximeng Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the Va Mountains revised its plans several times, and finally determined that the total industrial output value would exceed the total agricultural and sideline output value this year. By mid-June, fifteen of the twenty-five factories and mines planned to be established this year had been completed, including iron plants, lead plants, farm tool factories, flour mills, fertilizer factories, sewing factories, pottery factories, and wild plant oil processing factories. Most of them have been put into production. Textile factories, ethnic jewelry processing factories, oil pressing factories, etc. are also being actively prepared for construction.

With the establishment of factories, a group of local ethnic workers are also growing up. Of the more than 100 workers in the various factories, local Va and other ethnic minority workers account for half. Some of these ethnic minority workers have studied in the interior, but most of them have gradually grown up while working and learning with the help of Han masters in the factory. In Red May, ten of the twenty or so Va workers in the May 1st Lead Factory were rated as models and received awards. (Attached pictures)

The Va Mountains, a region that had no handicrafts in the past, has also started iron smelting industry. This year, the total industrial output value will exceed the agricultural and sideline output value. This is the Nankang Iron Plant under construction, with a small blast furnace built in the middle.

### 跨过几个历史时代向社会主义飞跃  云南佧佤族大办工业

    跨过几个历史时代向社会主义飞跃
    云南佧佤族大办工业
    本报讯  记者王传国报道：在祖国大跃进的时代里，云南省佧佤山上的少数民族跨过了几个历史时代，正在大办工业。工业的总产值，今年内就要超过农业总产值。
    不久以前，处于原始状态的佧佤人，还只会用“刀耕火种”的方法经营几种旱地作物，连最简单的手工业也没有。他们需用的生产资料、日用百货和副食品等，全部由内地远道运来，市场上找不出一样东西是当地生产的。而现在，商店里已出现了五、六十种当地工厂制造或加工的产品。像犁头、锄头、砍刀等农具和民族服装等，已停止由外地调运，本地可以自给。由于建立了陶器厂，佧佤人长期使用的木钵、竹筒，将很快被陶制的碗、盘、杯、罐所代替。
    佧佤山的工业，是在党的领导下，由先进民族进行无私的帮助而兴办起来的。今年2、3月间，当邻近的、思茅、普洱和墨江等县，知道佧佤人有办工业的要求以后，马上抽出人力、物力全面支援。上级领导机关还特地发出指示：要附近几个县分别包干，支援佧佤山的建设。接着，思普铁厂便送来了炼铁工人，墨江也调来了陶器工人，在他们帮助下，佧佤山很快便把铁厂、铅厂和陶器厂建立了起来。思茅铁工厂听说佧佤人要扩建农具厂，主动表示愿意给机器和技术工人。澜沧在本县财政比较紧张的情况下，还拨给了三万元资金给佧佤山。中共澜沧工委还专门派出了工作组，到农村访问汉族、拉祜族中的土专家，组织了一批技术人材到佧佤山参加建设。
    内地先进民族的无私帮助，使佧佤人受到很大鼓舞。佧佤山中共西盟工委曾几次修订计划，最后确定：工业总产值今年就要超过农副业总产值。到6月中旬为止，今年计划建立的二十五个厂矿，已有铁厂、铅厂、农具厂、面粉厂、肥料厂、缝纫厂、陶器厂和野生植物油加工厂等十五个厂矿建成，大部分都已投入生产。纺织厂、民族首饰加工厂、榨油厂等，也正在积极筹建。
    随着工厂的建立，一批当地的民族工人也正在成长起来。各厂现有的一百多名工人中，当地佧佤族和其他少数民族的工人占一半。这些少数民族工人，有的曾到内地学习过，但大部分都是在厂里汉族师傅帮助下，边做边学，逐步成长起来的。在红5月里，五一铅厂的二十多个佧佤族工人，就有十个被评为模范，受到了奖励。（附图片）
    这是佧佤山驻马散地区的汉族干部在教群众“稀秧密植”的方法。
    窝努农业社是佧佤山建立的第一个社。这是窝努社社长岩甩（右三）在向参观的人讲解新式步犁的使用方法。
    这是岩肯（中）和岩档（右）非常满意地收到西盟人民银行干部送来的贷款。
    佧佤山，过去连手工业也没有的地区，也兴办起炼铁工业。今年内工业总产值就要超过农副业产值。这是正在建设中的南亢铁厂，中间是修的小高炉。佧佤族人民居住的大山中的梯田。
