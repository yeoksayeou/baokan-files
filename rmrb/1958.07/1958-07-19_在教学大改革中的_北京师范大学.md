    Beijing Normal University in the Great Reform of Teaching

    Beijing Normal University is training a new type of teacher for the working class.
    This school is the oldest and largest higher normal school in the country. It was founded in 1902. It currently has ten departments: Education, Political Education, Chinese, Russian, History, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and the newly established Chemical Engineering major. The school has a total of 5,262 teachers and students, and 800 correspondence students. This year, it will enroll 1,960 students, an increase of 60% compared to last year. In addition, it will recruit 500 in-service teachers and graduate students, as well as recent graduates from higher normal schools, higher normal school teaching assistants, middle school teachers, and working cadres, to train them as teachers for teachers' colleges and normal schools.
    Based on the rectification movement, this school has launched a comprehensive Great Leap Forward centered on educational reform, and its appearance has been completely renewed. The History Department has added "History of Chinese Nationalities" and "History of the People's Republic of China." The Physics Department has changed the Electrical Engineering and Radio course to Electronics, teaching knowledge of television, radar, semiconductors, automatic control, and other topics.
    Productive labor is an important part of this school's teaching plan. Many departments' teachers and students will spend a certain amount of time going to factories and the countryside to participate in productive labor and practical work. At the same time, they will run vocational middle schools, conduct on-site teaching for some courses, and conduct investigations and research; combining labor training, educational practice, teaching, and scientific research. Currently, the Biology Department has established a worker-peasant cadre class in Yongfengtun Township, Changping District, Beijing, established a plant science research station, and also assisted the township in running Hongqi (Red Flag) University. Beijing Normal University has set off a high tide of great educational reform and the study of Marxism.

    在教学大改革中的——
    北京师范大学
    北京师范大学是培养工人阶级新型教师的队伍。
    这个学校是全国历史最久、规模最大的高等师范学校。它成立于1902年。现有十个系：教育、政治教育、中文、俄语、历史、地理、数学、物理、生物、化学及新设的化工专业。全校师生共五千二百六十二人，函授生八百人。今年招生一千九百六十名，比去年增加60％。此外招收进修教师、研究生五百名，招收应届高师毕业生，高师助教，中学教师和工作干部，培养为师院、师专的师资。
    在整风运动基础上，这个学校展开以教育改革为中心的全面大跃进，面貌焕然一新。历史系增开“中国民族史”、“中华人民共和国史”。物理系把电工与无线电课改为电子学，讲授电视、雷达、半导体、自动控制等知识。
    生产劳动是这个学校教学计划重要组成部分。许多系师生将有一定时间下厂下乡，参加生产劳动及实际工作，同时举办职业中学，部分课程进行现场教学，进行调查研究；把劳动锻炼，教育实习，教学和科学研究结合起来。目前，生物系在北京昌平区永丰屯乡办了工农干部班，建立了植物科学研究站，还协助这个乡办了红旗大学。北京师范大学已掀起教育大改革和学习马克思主义高潮。
