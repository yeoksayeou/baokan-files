    A Needle
    When we returned to the barracks from the construction site, while sorting out personal belongings, Wang Xiaoyi, the deputy squad leader of the Third Squad, found a needle in his bag. It turned out that he had forgotten to return it to the landlord when leaving the construction site. He was in a great sweat at the time, thinking: People's soldiers cannot violate the interests of the masses, so he decided to ask the company commander for leave to return it to the landlord. The comrades in the squad were as anxious as he was and thought it should be returned. In order not to affect study, everyone came up with a solution: let Comrade Wang Xiaoyi write a letter, wrap the needle, and mail it back to the landlord.
    A few days later, the Third Squad received a reply from the landlord, praising the comrades of the Third Squad in the letter: "You work tirelessly for the farmers, busy day and night repairing the reservoir, and you didn't even keep this needle for your own use…."

    一根针
    我们从工地回到营房，在整理个人衣物时，三班副班长王孝义同志发现自己挂包里有一根针。原来在离开工地时，忘了还给房东。当时他急得满头大汗，他想：人民战士不能违反群众利益，便决定向连首长请个假送还房东。班里的同志和他一样着急，都认为应当送回去。为了不影响学习，大家想了个办法：让王孝义同志写封信，把针包好一起邮还房东。
    不几天，三班接到了房东的回信，信上称赞三班同志：“你们为了农民不顾疲劳，黑夜白天忙着修水库，连这个针都不留着用……。”
