    Preventing and Controlling the Major Enemy of Corn - The Corn Borer
    The corn borer is a global pest and also one of the most important miscellaneous grain pests in our country. The corn borer is also known as the corn heartworm, corn stem borer, chestnut field moth, etc. It belongs to the Lepidoptera Pyralidae family. Its life cycle goes through four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. It is the corn borer larvae that harm the corn plant and ear. After hatching, the corn borer larvae gradually bore into the surface of the heart leaves, the midrib of the leaves, the stalks, the male flower stalks, and the tassels, continuing to damage the corn until the ears are mature.
    How much damage does the corn borer actually cause to crops? The stems are easily broken after being damaged; the male tassels are bored off, reducing the pollination rate of the female ears; the stems are bored into, destroying the vascular tissue and cutting off the supply of nutrients and water; and some kernels are directly destroyed. According to a survey by the former North China Agricultural Science Institute, if there are 1.2 corn borers per corn stalk, the yield is generally reduced by 10-20%; if there are more than 20 corn borers per plant, the yield may be reduced by 80%, or even result in crop failure.
    The corn borer is an omnivorous pest, and its targets include: corn, sorghum, millet (foxtail millet), wheat, kidney beans, cotton, hemp crops, etc.
    The corn borer has a six-to-eight-month overwintering period hidden inside the stalks, so dealing with overwintering hosts and eliminating the corn borer during the overwintering period is a powerful way to eradicate the corn borer. During the corn borer occurrence period, chemical control and removal of egg masses can be used. Using a “666” solution (6% wettable 666 in 600 to 800 times water solution) to irrigate the heart leaves before the corn is about to tassel is an effective way to control corn borer larvae. With this method, one catty of water solution can irrigate 40 to 50 corn plants. When the corn is tasseling, sprinkling 0.5% 666 powder on the tassels and ear shanks is also a method.
    Adult corn borers mostly lay their eggs on the back of leaves. When corn borers are laying eggs in large quantities, women and children can be mobilized to remove them.
    From late July to early August (i.e., between the end of the first generation larvae and the beginning of the second generation larvae), a small, very active ichneumon wasp in the field can parasitize more than half of the first generation corn borer larvae. In August, there is also an egg parasitic wasp that parasitizes the corn borer eggs, turning them black. The natural enemies of the corn borer play a certain role in inhibiting the occurrence of the corn borer. (Attached pictures)

    防治玉米的大敌——玉米螟
    玉米螟是世界性害虫，也是我国一种最主要的杂谷害虫。玉米螟又叫玉米钻心虫、玉米蛀茎虫、栗野螟等，属鳞翅目螟蛾科，它的一生经过卵、幼虫、蛹、成虫四个时期。为害玉米株穗的是玉米螟幼虫。玉米螟幼虫在孵化后就逐步在心叶表面、叶的中肋、茎秆、雄花柄、雄穗等部蛀食，一直为害到玉米穗成熟前后。
    玉米螟对作物的为害究竟有多大呢？茎秆被害以后容易折断；蛀断雄穗，降低雌穗受粉率；蛀入茎秆，破坏输导组织，断绝营养和水分的输送；直接破坏部分籽粒。根据前华北农业科学研究所调查，玉米茎秆有虫一点二条，一般减产一、二成；每株有虫二十条以上，就可能减产80％，甚至失收。
    玉米螟是杂食性害虫，它的为害对象有：玉米、高粱、谷子（粟）、麦类、芸豆、棉花、麻类作物等。
    玉米螟在茎秆内有六到八个月的潜藏越冬期，所以处理越冬寄主，把玉米螟消灭在越冬时期，是根绝玉米螟有力办法。在玉米螟发生时期，可以用药剂防治和摘除卵块。用“六六六”溶液（6％的可湿性六六六的六百到八百倍水溶液），在玉米临近抽雄花前灌心叶是防治玉米螟幼虫的一个有效办法。这样防治，一斤水溶液可灌四、五十株玉米。在玉米抽雌穗的时候，用0.5％六六六粉，向穗头、穗柄扑撒，也是一种方法。
    玉米螟成虫多在叶子背面等处产卵。在玉米螟大量产卵的时候，可以发动妇女、儿童摘除。
    在7月下旬到8月上旬（也就是第一代幼虫末期和第二代幼虫初期之间），有一种在田间很活动的小茧蜂可以把玉米螟第一代幼虫寄生到半数以上。8月间还有一种卵寄生蜂，寄生在玉米螟卵里，使虫卵变成黑色。玉米螟的天敌对抑制玉米螟发生是有一定作用的。（附图片）
