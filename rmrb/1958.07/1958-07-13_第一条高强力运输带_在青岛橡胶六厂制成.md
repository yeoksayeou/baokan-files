    The First High-Strength Conveyor Belt
    Was Made at Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 6
    China's first high-strength conveyor belt was successfully trial-produced at the state-owned Qingdao No. 6 Rubber Factory in early July and is now preparing for mass production.

    This type of conveyor belt is a major component of blast furnace transportation equipment, and China had not produced it before. In order to vigorously support the construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO), the workers of Qingdao No. 6 Rubber Factory boldly innovated and worked hard, and with the assistance of Qingdao State-owned No. 2 Cotton Factory, they finally succeeded in the trial production. After testing, its tensile strength reached 560 kilograms per 5 centimeters, greatly exceeding the level of similar British products at 466 kilograms per 5 centimeters.

    第一条高强力运输带
    在青岛橡胶六厂制成
    我国第一条高强力运输带7月初在国营青岛第六橡胶厂试制成功，正在准备成批生产。
    这种运输带是高炉运输设备的主要部件，我国过去没有生产过。青岛第六橡胶厂的职工为大力支援武钢建设，大胆创造，刻苦钻研，在青岛国棉二厂的协助下，终于试制成功。经过鉴定，它的扯断强力达到每五公分五百六十公斤，大大超过英国同类产品每五公分四百六十六公斤的水平。
