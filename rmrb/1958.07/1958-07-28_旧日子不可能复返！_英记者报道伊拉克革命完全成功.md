The Old Days Can Never Return!
British Reporter Reports Complete Success of Iraqi Revolution
Editor's Note: The British "News Chronicle" published a report on the 23rd by "Richard Beeston, one of the first journalists to enter Baghdad," dispatched from Baghdad on Tuesday, titled "British Nationals in Iraq Safe and Sound." It is not difficult to see from the pen of the British journalist that all the slanders against the Iraqi revolutionary coup are completely unfounded. The Iraqi people have stood up, forcing this bourgeois journalist to conclude that the old days can never return. The following is a summary of this report.

The following are the two main facts that Britain has been waiting to hear:
British nationals in Iraq are safe and sound, and the Iraqi revolution has been completely successful.

Sir Michael Wright, the British Ambassador, who emptied the embassy and moved headquarters into a Baghdad hotel, told me in his luxurious suite on the 22nd: "Business continues as usual throughout the country, and life goes on normally."

It seems we need to learn to get along with the new Iraqi government, or we risk facing an even worse situation.

Whether the balance between Nasser and the West can be maintained remains to be seen, but unless we are prepared to make significant concessions to the nationalistic concepts of the average Iraqi, the West will certainly tip the scales in favor of Nasser.

The Nuri faction is either dead or imprisoned. The old days can never return, and the sooner we realize this, the better.

I left Damascus on Sunday morning and arrived in Baghdad on Monday evening...

Half of the seven-hundred-mile journey was through Iraqi territory, and the entire region appeared to be under the control of the new regime.

    旧日子不可能复返！
    英记者报道伊拉克革命完全成功
    编者按：英国“新闻纪事报”23日发表“进入巴格达的第一批记者之一理查德·比斯顿”星期二自巴格达发出的一篇报道，标题是“在伊拉克的英侨平安无事”。我们不难从英国记者的笔下，看到一切对伊拉克革命政变的诬蔑是完全没有根据的。伊拉克人民站起来了，使得这一位资产阶级的记者不能不得出旧日子不可能复返的结论。下面是这一报道的摘要。
    下面是英国一直期待听到的两个主要事实：
    在伊拉克的英侨平安无事，伊拉克的革命完全成功。
    把大使馆出空并将总部搬入巴格达旅馆的英国大使迈凯耳·赖特爵士22日在他的豪华的套房中对我说：“全国各地继续营业，过着正常生活。”
    看来，我们似乎需要学习跟伊拉克新政府相处，否则就有面临更糟的局面的危险。
    纳赛尔和西方之间的平衡能否保持还有待分晓，但是除非我们准备对普通伊拉克人的民族主义概念作出重大的让步，西方肯定会使天平倒向有利于纳赛尔的一方。
    努里派死的死了，关的关起来了，旧的日子不可能再复返，我们越早认识到这一点越好。
    我星期天早晨离开大马士革，星期一傍晚到达巴格达，……
    七百英里的旅程的一半是经过伊拉克境内的，整个地区看来都在新政权的控制下。
