The U.S. Plays the Usual Trick of "Stop Thief!"
    Attempting to Fabricate Lies to Slander the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) "Stop thief!" the interferer shouts against "interference." The U.S. and British aggressors are attempting to use this despicable trick of counter-accusation and diverting world public opinion to attack the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic, which are upholding peace and justice. The instructions issued by the U.S. State Department to U.S. embassies in the Middle East expose this attempt.
    The Indian "Delhi Times Weekly" reported on the 29th that, according to sources close to the U.S. Embassy there, the U.S. State Department has instructed all U.S. embassies in the Middle East to prepare and publish fabricated news in local newspapers, accusing the United Arab Republic and the Soviet Union of being the organizers of conspiracies against the former Iraqi government. The report also said that the United States is attempting to divert world public opinion from its aggression in Lebanon through this step. On the same day, the "Statesman" published a letter from U.S. Ambassador to India Bunker to the United Arab Republic's Ambassador to India. Bunker defended the U.S. aggression against Lebanon, insisting that there was a "civil war launched for foreign interests" in Lebanon. The ambassador even said that the U.S. sent troops to Lebanon based on Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, and he actually considered the Lebanese Speaker's protest telegram as "not an official document." Bunker's letter stands in stark contrast to the large amount of news condemning the U.S.'s shameless aggression published daily in Indian newspapers. Even the "Statesman" (which was the only newspaper to publish Bunker's letter on the 29th) considered this a "very unusual step."
    However, it is the U.S. and British aggressors who are running rampant in Lebanon and Jordan, and it is the U.S. and British aggressors who are acting with a guilty conscience and refusing the five-nation summit conference. Therefore, no matter how many excuses they and their puppets fabricate, they cannot wash away their bloodstained hands. Facts cannot be covered up. All the secret documents of the Baghdad Pact seized by the Iraqi Republic government are slapping these sophists in the face. The U.S. "Newsweek" said on the 29th, "As far as Washington and London know, the entire archive of the Baghdad Pact organization has fallen into the hands of the new Iraqi government."
    "Newsweek" said that these archives include: First, countless military and strategic instructions given by the United States to the Baghdad Pact Group; second, joint aggression plans of Baghdad Pact member countries such as Turkey; third, all the materials of the so-called "Anti-Subversion Committee" belonging to the Baghdad Pact Organization, including the list of special intelligence personnel of this committee, and the list of communists and nationalist activists known to this committee. This archive concentrates so many unspeakable facts of the United States and the Baghdad Pact Group it directed that they are afraid of being exposed. According to the Damascus "Victory" newspaper on the 28th, citing well-informed sources, "The disintegrated Baghdad Pact countries authorized Pakistan to contact the Iraqi Republic, asking it not to disclose the documents confiscated from the organization's office in Baghdad, and these countries would recognize the Iraqi Republic in exchange." The newspaper also said that Pakistan's Chargé d'affaires in Baghdad had requested an emergency meeting with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, attempting to obtain Iraq's reply for transmission to London, where the Baghdad Pact conference was being held at that time.

### 美国玩弄“贼喊捉贼”惯技  妄图制造谎言诬蔑苏联和阿联

    美国玩弄“贼喊捉贼”惯技
    妄图制造谎言诬蔑苏联和阿联
    本报讯　“贼喊捉贼”，干涉者喊反对“干涉”，美英侵略者妄图用这种反咬一口和分散世界舆论的注意力的下流把戏，来攻击维护和平和正义的苏联和阿联。美国国务院向美驻中近东各使馆所发的指示暴露了这种企图。
    印度“德里时代周刊”29日报道，据接近这里美国大使馆的人士说，美国国务院已经指示美国驻中近东各国的所有大使馆准备在当地报纸上发表一些捏造的消息，指责阿联和苏联是阴谋反对前伊拉克政府的组织者。这个消息又说，美国企图通过这一步骤分散世界舆论对它在黎巴嫩的侵略活动的注意力。同一天的“政治家报”发表美国驻印度大使班克给阿联驻印度大使的一封信。班克为美国对黎巴嫩的侵略进行辩解，他硬说在黎巴嫩存在什么“为了外国利益而发动的内战”。这位大使甚至说美国是根据联合国宪章第五十一条派美军登陆的，他竟然认为黎巴嫩议长的抗议电报“不是正式的文件”。班克的这封信同印度各报日常发表的谴责美国无耻侵略的大量消息成了显著的对照。即使“政治家报”（它是29日唯一发表班克信件的报纸）也认为这是“非常异乎寻常的步骤”。
    然而，在黎巴嫩和约旦横行霸道的是美英侵略者，作贼心虚、拒绝五国首脑会议的又是美英侵略者。所以，不管它们和它们的傀儡捏造出多少口实，都不能洗刷它们的那一双血手。事实是掩盖不了的。伊拉克共和国政府已查获的巴格达条约集团的全部秘密文件，在打着这些狡辩者的嘴巴。美国“新闻周刊”29日说，“就华盛顿和伦敦所知道的情况来说，巴格达条约组织的全部档案都已落入伊拉克新政府之手。
    “新闻周刊”说，这些档案包括：一、美国给予巴格达条约集团的军事上和战略上的无数指示；二、土耳其等巴格达条约成员国的联合侵略计划；三、巴格达条约组织所属的所谓“反颠覆委员会”的全部材料，其中有这个委员会的特务谍报人员的名单，这个委员会所了解的共产党员和民族主义活动分子的名单。这个档案集中了美国和它所指使的巴格达条约集团那么多不可告人的事实，它们害怕被揭露出来。据大马士革“胜利报”28日援引消息灵通人士的话说，“瓦解了的巴格达条约国家授权巴基斯坦向伊拉克共和国进行接触，要它不要透露从该条约组织在巴格达的办事处里所没收的文件，这些国家将以承认伊拉克共和国作为交换条件”。这家报纸又说，巴基斯坦驻巴格达的代办已经要求同伊拉克外交部长举行紧急会议，企图取得伊拉克的答复以便发往当时正在举行巴格达条约会议的伦敦。
