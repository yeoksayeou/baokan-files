Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th - Just as the United States is brandishing its claws and baring its teeth in the Middle East with its military adventures, its missile tests have punctured the boasts about its military strength. Recently, the U.S. Air Force's tests of the Atlas intercontinental missile have repeatedly failed. On the 19th, a U.S. Atlas missile exploded approximately forty-five seconds after launch at Cape Canaveral.

This missile was eighty-five feet long, and U.S. authorities boasted that it had three engines and could fly a distance of six thousand miles. The launch time was 17:37 standard time. Shortly after launch, it went haywire, and after forty-five seconds, it burst into two halves in a burst of orange-red flames, crashing headlong near the launch site.

An Associated Press dispatch stated that this explosion was the climax of a "heartbreak week" in the past week, during which the United States had failed three times in its attempts to launch the Atlas missile.

    毕竟是纸老虎
    美试验远程导弹连遭失败
    新华社20日讯  华盛顿消息：正当美国在中东张牙舞爪进行军事冒险的时候，它的导弹试验使它吹嘘军事实力的牛皮漏了气。最近，美国空军发射阿特拉斯洲际导弹的试验连续遭到失败。19日，美国一支阿特拉斯导弹在卡纳维拉尔角发射后约摸四十五秒钟就爆炸了。
    这枚导弹有八十五英尺长，美国有关方面吹嘘说它有三个引擎，能飞六千英里的距离。发射时间是标准时间十七点三十七分。发射后一会它就乱窜，四十五秒钟后，它就在一股橘红色的火焰中爆裂成两半，一头栽到发射地点附近的地方。
    美联社一条消息说，这次爆炸是过去一星期的“伤心周”的顶点，在这以前的一个星期内美国三次企图发射阿特拉斯导弹都失败了。
