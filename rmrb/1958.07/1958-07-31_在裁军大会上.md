    At the Disarmament Conference
    Guo Moruo
              (I) For one hundred and fifty years, peace has reigned; the northern capital is picturesque. The sea circles the bay like a shimmering lake; summer is without heat, surpassing autumn. The natural system embraced Linnaeus; new sculptures displayed in the Milles Garden. The sun shines all night, creating white nights; wild grasses still grow lushly in the forest.

              (II) Suddenly, news from the Middle East reports ominous war clouds; American troops have entered Lebanon. World public opinion is roused in common anger; a wave of condemnation unites all hearts. The raging torrent must eventually be turned back; comprehensive theories unsearched, unwilling to return. Say not the fragrant flowers are too few; insert red flags at the peace conference.
    ① Sweden has not suffered war for 150 years, and its capital, Stockholm, is beautifully picturesque.
    ② The botanist Linnaeus (1707-1778) was Swedish and wrote "Systema Naturae." Also, the late modern sculptor Milles was Swedish, and his works are displayed at his former residence in Stockholm, called the Milles Garden.
    ③ On July 15th, U.S. troops invaded Lebanon, the day before the conference. The next day, the conference opened and overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning American aggression and, at the same time, condemning Britain and Turkey for endangering peace in the Middle East.
    ④ The speeches of the Chinese delegation at the conference were well-received; the translated copies were snatched up, with some representatives saying that unless they received the translation, they were unwilling to leave Stockholm.

    在裁军大会上
    郭沫若
              （其一）弭兵一百五另年，北国都城入画筌。①海自湾环疑沼泊，夏无炎暑胜秋天。自然体系怀林奈，新派雕镌列米园。②日照终宵成白夜，林间杂草仍芊芊。
              （其二）中东忽报战云低，北美陈兵已入黎。③举世舆情公愤动，一场谴责众心齐。狂澜纵倒终须挽，崇论未搜不愿归。④莫道香花太寥落，和平会上插红旗。
    ①瑞典已有150年未遭战祸，首都斯德哥尔摩美丽如画。
    ②植物学家林奈（1707——1778）瑞典人，曾著“自然体系”一书。又近代已故雕刻家米列士亦瑞典人，在瑞京将其作品陈列于其故居，号曰米园。
    ③7月15日美国军队侵入黎巴嫩，乃开会之前一日。次日大会开幕即以绝大多数通过一决议案谴责美国侵略，并同时谴责英国和土耳其危害中东和平。
    ④中国代表团在大会上的发言受到欢迎，译文印发一扫而空，有代表未曾得到者，言得不到译文，不愿离开斯德哥尔摩云。
