    Constantly Improving Agricultural Technology

    Rapid Rice Harvester
    A rapid rice harvester, urgently needed for current agricultural production, has been successfully trial-produced by the Hengyang Construction Machinery Factory in Hunan Province. This innovation is of great significance in solving the labor shortage during the upcoming rush harvest and planting season. The CCP Hengyang Prefectural Committee has decided to promote 300,000 units throughout the entire prefecture. This will allow the prefecture to complete the harvest of 1.5 million mu of early rice ten days ahead of schedule, in just five days.
    After evaluation, this rapid rice harvester has five major advantages: First, it is simple to manufacture and inexpensive. Each unit requires only a small amount of wood and twelve taels of iron, costing less than two yuan, making it feasible for every township and commune to produce them. Second, it can greatly reduce labor intensity and improve labor efficiency. Using this tool, each person can harvest five to six mu of rice per day, increasing efficiency by four to five times compared to the old-fashioned sickle, and eliminating the need to bend over while harvesting. Third, it ensures safety and prevents the risk of cutting fingers or feet. Fourth, it can be used not only for harvesting rice, but also for wheat, rapeseed, sorghum, and other crops. Fifth, because it cuts close to the mud, it increases the amount of straw and reduces the resistance of rolling the rice stalks for the second crop.

    快速割禾器
    一种当前农业生产特别需要的快速割禾器，由湖南省衡阳建设机械厂试制成功。这一创造对于解决即将到来的抢收抢插中劳动力紧张问题有重大作用，中共衡阳地委决定在全专区推广三十万部。这样，就只需要五天时间，可以提前十天把全专区的一百五十万亩早稻收割完毕。
    经过鉴定，这种快速割禾器有五大优点：一、制造简单，造价便宜。每部只需少量木材和十二两铁，成本不到二元，每个乡、社都可以做。二、能大大减轻劳动强度，提高劳动工效。使用这个工具，每人每天能割禾五亩到六亩，比用旧式镰刀提高工效四、五倍，并且割禾时不要弯腰。三、可以保证安全，不致发生割破指脚的危险。四、不仅可以割禾，还能割麦子、油菜、高粱等。五、由于它挨泥割，既增加了稻草，还减少了二季稻打蒲滚的阻力。
