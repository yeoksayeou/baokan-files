	Min-Dian Railway's Yunnan-Guizhou Section Starts Construction
	Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 25th - Construction has recently begun on the Yunnan-Guizhou section of the Min-Dian Railway, a railway line traversing the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Currently, tens of thousands of personnel from a certain unit of the Railway Corps and Guizhou civilian laborers are deployed on a 152-kilometer stretch west of Guiyang, commencing excavation of key projects and earthwork for roadbeds along 28 kilometers of the line. In addition, the 137-kilometer section from Rongfeng in Yunnan to Shushe in Guizhou (including the section where the Neikun Railway connects from Weicha to Shushe) has been under construction by another unit of the Railway Corps and tens of thousands of civilian laborers since mid-June.
	The Yunnan-Guizhou section of the Min-Dian Railway runs predominantly through mountainous regions, crossing the watershed between the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers at an altitude of approximately 2,000 meters, making the project exceptionally challenging and complex. Along the total length of 410 kilometers, approximately 62 million cubic meters of earth and stone must be excavated and filled, averaging over 150,000 cubic meters per kilometer. Furthermore, 118 tunnels, totaling 68 kilometers in length, must be bored. In addition, the entire line includes 120 bridges and numerous culverts.

    闽滇铁路滇黔段动工
    据新华社贵州25日电　穿越云贵高原的一条铁路——闽滇铁路滇黔段最近动工兴建。现在，铁道兵某部和贵州民工共数万人，正在贵阳以西一百五十二公里的线路上摆开阵势，开始开挖部分重点工程和二十八公里线路路基土石方。此外，由云南榕峰到贵州树舍的一百三十七公里（包括内昆铁路威察到树舍接轨一段）的铁路，已由铁道兵另一部队和数万民工在6月中旬开始施工。
    闽滇铁路滇黔段，绝大部分线路都是穿行在高山地区，中间要穿过海拔二千公尺左右的长江、珠江分水岭，工程异常艰巨复杂。在总长四百一十公里的线路中，约要挖填六千二百万土石方，平均每一公里有十五万多方；而且要打通共长六十八公里的隧道一百一十八座。此外，全线还有一百二十座桥梁和许多涵渠。
