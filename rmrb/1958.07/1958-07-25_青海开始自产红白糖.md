Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 22nd: Qinghai Province's first sugar refinery has been completed at the Delingha Farm on the eastern edge of the Qaidam Basin and has already produced red and white sugar. The sugar's sweetness is normal.

    The factory building was renovated using some of the original dormitories. Apart from the centrifugal separator and vegetable cutting machine which were purchased from other places, other equipment such as the vegetable washing machine, blower, and pressing machine were all manufactured by the factory workers using wood and scrap iron. The total investment was only a little over 300 yuan.

    青海开始自产红白糖
    据新华社西宁22日电　青海省第一座制糖厂在柴达木盆地东沿的德令哈农场建成，并已生产出红、白砂糖，糖的甜味正常。
    这个厂厂房是利用原来的一部分宿舍修缮而成。制糖设备除离心式分泌机和切菜机是从外地购买的以外，其他如洗菜机、鼓风器、压榨机等，都是本厂职工用木料和废铁制造的。全部投资只三百多元。
