Xinhua News Agency, July 16th dispatch from Washington: Following its troop deployment to Lebanon, the United States government is now plotting to send troops to Jordan in a further attempt to threaten the revolutionary regime in Iraq and suppress the national independence and national liberation movements in the Middle East on a large scale.

According to well-informed sources in Washington today, the United States government has "agreed" to Jordan's "formal request" for the US to "provide personnel and military material assistance." However, a statement by a US State Department spokesman on the 15th indicated that Jordan's so-called "formal request" was merely the result of US instigation and encouragement. The spokesman said, "The United States government is in constant contact with the Jordanian government. The Jordanian government knows that the United States is concerned about Jordan's efforts to maintain its independence and integrity."

According to a report in London's "Daily Mail" today, American weapons are being continuously shipped into Jordan through the port of Aqaba. Supply ships are unloading cargo throughout the night under the illumination of searchlights.

At the same time, diplomatic sources in Washington revealed that the British government is also preparing to send troops to Jordan at any time, and Britain is also preparing to carry out military intervention in Iraq.

It is said that the United States and Britain are secretly plotting a joint military action in the Middle East, the purpose of which is to control the Middle East region.

Xinhua News Agency, London, July 15th: There are indications that the British government is eager to try to send troops to suppress the vigorously developing Arab national liberation movement.

Foreign Secretary Lloyd announced in the House of Commons today that "the Queen's government fully supports" the United States' actions, and the British "government has been in close consultation with the United States government. The government received prior notification of the United States' actions and the intentions of the United States government." Lloyd's words show that the US troop deployment to Lebanon is the result of an imperialist conspiracy.

Lloyd also said; "British troops have not participated in (the US) operation. However, British troops stationed in the region are on alert."

Lloyd refused to give assurances on the following requests: that the British government would not use British troops in Iraq, Lebanon, or Jordan without consulting the House of Commons.

The fact is that, contrary to the above requirements, the British authorities have been making intense preparations for direct military intervention very rapidly. After US troops landed in Beirut, the British army, navy, and air force were already mobilizing.

A statement just released by the British Ministry of Defense said that the British government has decided to take certain "precautionary measures" in response to the situation in the Middle East. These measures include: ordering an infantry brigade in Britain and a parachute brigade and the 1st Guards Brigade in Cyprus to be on alert, and sending additional troops from Kenya to Aden, and then transferring troops from Aden to the Persian Gulf area.

Reports say that naval forces stationed in the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf have also taken so-called "certain preventive" actions. The Admiralty confirmed tonight that part of the Royal Marines stationed in Malta will be transferred to Cyprus to reinforce the Royal Marines there.

Xinhua News Agency, July 16th dispatch from Paris: French Propaganda Minister Soustelle said yesterday after a cabinet meeting that France also intends to send troops to suppress the nationalist movement in the Middle East. He said that France already has a naval force in the eastern Mediterranean. "If necessary, and with the consent of the Lebanese (Chamoun) government," the French Navy will be dispatched to "defend" French interests there.

Xinhua News Agency, July 16th dispatch from Rome: A member of the Italian government threatened on the 15th that Italy intends to participate in the armed intervention of Western countries against Middle Eastern countries, saying that most of the Italian armed forces were already in a "pre-alert state" on the 15th.

The government member said that Italy is prepared to "contribute to the United Nations armed forces" if the United Nations requests it to do so. He said: "An army unit has entered a state of alert and is ready to be mobilized immediately after receiving notification."

Xinhua News Agency, July 16th dispatch from Ankara: The heads of the three Muslim member states of the Baghdad Pact—Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan—continued to hold tense secret talks in Ankara on the 15th. At the same time, the Turkish government officially announced that the Turkish government had notified King Hussein of Jordan that Turkey and other members of the Baghdad Pact had decided to "fulfill the obligations stipulated by the Baghdad Pact." Agence France-Presse also quoted Turkish officials as saying that Turkey has contacted Amman and expressed its willingness to provide immediate assistance to Hussein.

Reuters reported from Istanbul that the Turkish army canceled all leave today. Officers on leave have been recalled to their units.

    据新华社16日讯　巴黎消息：戴高乐政府的宣传部长苏斯戴尔昨天在内阁会议后表示，法国也有意出兵镇压中东的民族主义运动。他说，法国已经有一支海军部队在东地中海。“如果有必要，并且在征得黎巴嫩（夏蒙）政府的同意下”，法国海军将出动，以便“保卫”法国在那里的利益。
