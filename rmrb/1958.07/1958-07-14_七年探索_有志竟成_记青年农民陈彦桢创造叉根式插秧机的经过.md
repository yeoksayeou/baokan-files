Seven Years of Exploration, Aspiration Achieved
——A Record of Young Farmer Chen Yanzhen's Creation of the Fork-Rooted Rice Transplanter
By Our Staff Reporter Shao Yongli

At the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, a wooden three-row fork-rooted rice transplanter recently on display has been attracting crowds like a magnet. The guide told the audience: This kind of rice transplanter is unprecedented in our country. It only requires one person to pull it and can transplant one mu of rice per hour, which is ten to twelve times more efficient than manual transplanting. It transplants straight, fast, steadily, and evenly, and can also be used in terraced fields and small plots.

This rice transplanter was created by Chen Yanzhen, a member of the Jianguo Agricultural Cooperative in Cenxi County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It is simple in structure and small and exquisite. Of the dozens of parts that make up the rice transplanter, all but three are made of iron, and the cost is only twenty-odd yuan. Any carpenter can imitate it. The masses praised it as a truly "more, faster, better, and more economical" agricultural tool.

A few days ago, this reporter interviewed this inventor in Beijing and was deeply moved by his spirit of daring to think, dare to do, not fearing difficulties, never giving up, and working hard to research. It took Chen Yanzhen a total of seven years and experienced over a thousand failures to create this rice transplanter from start to success.

Seven years ago, Chen Yanzhen was still a high school student lacking production experience and a tuberculosis patient. He deeply realized from labor that farmers were tired of transplanting rice and that the efficiency of manual transplanting was very low, so he vowed to invent a machine to replace manual rice transplanting.

In the winter of 1951, he started to create it. He would make models out of paper whenever he had an idea in his mind. Later, he made models out of wood. One drawing after another, one model after another, his home was full of drawings and models, parts, and tools of the rice transplanter. However, in the early years, he did not find the correct path to creation, did not rely on the Party and the masses, but fought alone, which increased the difficulty of his creation. He did not have money to buy materials for testing, so he sawed apart the benches, tables, wooden basins, etc. in his home to make models. He didn't even spare his own big wooden bed, first sawing the big wooden bed in half, using one half to sleep on and the other half to make a model; later, he simply slept on a damaged wide bench and continued to make a model with the half bed. Finally, all the usable furniture in the house was used up, and the village cadres took some wooden boards from the temple for him. In the summer, regardless of the sun and rain, he squatted in the field dragging his "machine," testing and modifying it; in the winter, he cut a pile of paper strips, assuming they were rice seedlings, to do experiments... He just thought and did, did and tested, destroyed it if it didn't work, and struggled for five years, making countless parts and building more than twenty models, but without success.

In 1955, in the process of creating the rice transplanter, he found that the rice seedlings sown by hand were uneven and untidy. So, he made a determined effort and spent fifteen days and nights to create a broom-type rice seeder. The successful creation of the rice seeder made him see that it was possible to succeed in creating a rice transplanter. At this time, his life was very difficult, and his lung disease was also deteriorating. His creative work was even more intense and arduous.

When the fact that he had successfully created a seeder was discovered by the Cenxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, they immediately sent cadres to visit him and encourage him. Soon, he was transferred to the county, where the government provided him with living expenses and testing fees to support his creation. The county party secretary and other responsible cadres also often encouraged him and watched his experiments. However, he failed after three months of work. At this time, some people in the county lost confidence in his creation, and a cadre temporarily in charge of the agricultural science department even stopped paying Chen Yanzhen's living expenses and testing fees without authorization. In this situation, Chen Yanzhen's confidence also wavered. The county party secretary learned about this situation and talked to him to continue encouraging him and supporting him, saying: "It doesn't matter, if you fail, come again, those with aspirations will eventually succeed!" and continued to provide him with living expenses and testing fees. To take care of his long-term experiments, he was also assigned to work as a technician at the county agricultural tool promotion station. The cadres of the county agricultural science department also took out their own wages to help him solve his difficulties. The four carpenters who often processed models for Chen Yanzhen also supported him and took the initiative to waive their wages when he had difficulties. With such help and support from the Party and the masses, Chen Yanzhen's mood, which had fallen into regret and wavering, was revitalized. The county party committee also helped him change his method of solo creation and introduced some people who understood science and technology to talk to him face-to-face or correspond with him.

In the autumn of 1956, not long after Chen Yanzhen arrived at the agricultural tool promotion station, the county party committee asked him to take the rice transplanter, which had not been finalized, to the Rongxian District to participate in the creation and invention observation and evaluation meeting. At the observation meeting, he gained a lot of inspiration from other people's creations and inventions, and many agricultural tool experts and technicians also pointed out the areas where his rice transplanter needed improvement. After returning, he followed the suggestions of experts and technicians and changed the original rice transplanter that transplanted seedlings with a shovel to one that transplanted seedlings by pulling them out. After another winter of experimentation, only the seedling dividing part of the entire rice transplanter remained unresolved. When he had not yet come up with a solution, Guan Jialin, a primary school teacher who was also an explorer of rice transplanters, came to his door and gave him an idea to solve the problem of seedling dividing. Chen Yanzhen immediately experimented according to what he said, and the result was good. Last year, the county agricultural tool promotion station was abolished, and Chen Yanzhen returned to the agricultural cooperative, continuing to improve the rice transplanter while engaging in production. At the beginning of this year, with the help of experts from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute, he finally successfully realized his ideal of seven years ago.

In April this year, when the fork-rooted rice transplanter he created appeared at the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Agricultural Tool Exhibition, it was greatly welcomed and praised by the masses. The masses in many places rushed to imitate it day and night on the spot, and now it is being widely promoted throughout the autonomous region.

Chen Yanzhen's experience in creating the fork-rooted rice transplanter shows that in our country, with the leadership of the Communist Party and the support of the masses, anyone who is determined to contribute to society, as long as they dare to think, dare to act, and dare to create, no matter how great the difficulties and how many failures, will eventually realize their ideals. Chen Yanzhen told reporters that he now has a new idea, to create a new machine that can pull and wash seedlings, so that from sowing and pulling seedlings to transplanting in paddy field production, machines can be used. Let us wish him here, continue to make persistent efforts, and achieve new successes!

    七年探索　有志竟成
    ——记青年农民陈彦桢创造叉根式插秧机的经过
    本报记者　邵永力
    全国农具展览会上，最近展出的一台木制三行叉根式插秧机，像磁石一样吸引着群众。说明员告诉观众们说：这种插秧机在我国是前所未见的，只用一个人拉，每小时能插秧一亩，比手工插秧效率高十倍到十二倍，插得直、快、稳、匀，梯田和小块水田也可以使用。
    这台插秧机是广西僮族自治区岑溪县建国农业社社员陈彦桢创造的。结构简单，小巧玲珑。组成插秧机的几十件零件中，除三件是铁制外，全部为木制，成本只要二十几元。任何一个木匠都能够仿造。群众夸它是一种名符其实的“多快好省”农具。
    前几天，记者在北京访问了这位发明家，深为他那种敢想、敢干，不畏困难，百折不回，刻苦钻研的创造精神所感动。这种插秧机从开始创造到成功，陈彦桢共花了七年工夫，经历了千多次失败。
    七年前陈彦桢还是一个缺乏生产经验的高中学生，并且又是个肺结核患者。他从劳动中深深体会到农民插秧的劳累和手插秧的效率很低，便立志要发明一种机器来代替人力插秧。
    1951年冬天，他就开始动手创造了。脑子里想出图样来，就用纸片做模型。以后又用木头做模型。一个又一个图样，一个又一个模型，他在家里，到处是大大小小插秧机的图样和模型、零件、工具。可是，最初的几年，他并未找到正确的创造道路，没有依靠党和群众，而是孤军奋斗，这就增加了他创造上的困难。他没有钱买试验用的材料，就把家里的板凳、桌子、木盆等都锯开做模型。连自己睡觉的一张大木床也不放过，起先把大木床锯两半，一半用来睡觉，一半用做模型；后来干脆睡在一张损坏了的宽板凳上，把半张床继续做了模型。最后家中所有能够利用的家具都用完了，村里干部便从神庙拿了一些木板给他。在夏天，他不顾日晒雨淋，蹲在田里拖着他的“机器”，一边试验一边修改；冬天里，又剪一堆纸须，假定是秧苗，来做试验……他就这样想了做，做了试，试了不行再毁，一直奋斗了五年，做了无数的零件，造了二十几个模型，但没有成功。
    1955年，他在创造插秧机的过程中，发现人工播种的稻苗不均匀、不整齐。于是，一鼓作气，花了十五个昼夜，创造了一台扫巴式水稻播种机。水稻播种机创造成功，使他看到了创造插秧机有可能获得成功的苗头。这时，他的生活很困难，肺病也在恶化，他的创造劳动更加紧张和艰苦了。
    当他创造播种机成功的事迹，被中共岑溪县委会发现后，立刻派干部去慰问他，鼓励他。不久就调他到县里由公家供给他生活费和试验费用，支持他的创造。县委书记和其他负责干部也都经常鼓励他，观看他试验。但是，他干了三个月都失败了。这时县里有些人对他的创造失去了信心，农业科一位临时担任负责工作的干部，竟擅自停发了陈彦桢的生活费和试验费。在这种情况下，陈彦桢的信心也动摇了。县委书记了解了这个情况，找他谈话继续鼓励他，支持他说：“不要紧，失败了，再来，有志者终会是成功的！”并且继续供给他生活费用和试验费，为了照顾他的长期试验，还派他到县农具推广站做技术工人。县农业科的干部，也拿出自己的工资帮助他解决困难。经常为陈彦桢加工模型的四个木匠，也支持他，在他有困难的时候，还主动提出不要工钱。陈彦桢得到党和群众的这样帮助和支持，一度陷入懊悔、动摇的情绪重新振作起来。县委还帮助他改变了单干的创造方法，并介绍了一些懂得科学技术的人同他面谈或通信。
    1956年秋天，陈彦桢到农具推广站不久，县委就让他带着没有最后成功的插秧机到容县专区参加创造发明观摩评比会。在观摩会上，他从别人的创造发明中，得到很多启示，许多农具专家和技术人员还指出他的插秧机需要改进的地方。回来以后，他按着专家和技术人员的建议，把原来插铲秧的插秧机改为插拔秧的。又经过一个冬季的试验，整个插秧机只剩下分秧部分没有解决了，当他还没有想出办法的时候，也是一位插秧机的探索者、小学教员关家琳找上他的门。给他出了一个解决分秧问题的主意。陈彦桢马上按着他说的道理做了试验，结果良好。去年，县农具推广站撤消，陈彦桢回到农业社，一边生产，一边继续改进插秧机。今年年初，终于在广西僮族自治区农业机械化研究所的专家们帮助下，胜利地实现了他七年前的理想。
    今年4月，当他创造的叉根式插秧机，出现在广西僮族自治区农业工具展览会上的时候，受到群众的很大欢迎和赞扬。许多地方的群众当场日夜赶工仿制，现在，正在全自治区普遍推广。
    陈彦桢创造叉根式插秧机的经过说明，在我们国家里，有共产党的领导，群众的支持，任何一个有志为社会做出贡献的人，只要敢想、敢干、敢于创造，不管有多大的困难，多少次的失败，最后都会实现自己的理想。陈彦桢告诉记者，他现在又有了一个新的想法，再创造一种能够拔秧又能洗秧的新机器，使水田生产从播种、拔秧到插秧都使用机器。让我们在这里预祝他，再接再厉，获得新的成功！
