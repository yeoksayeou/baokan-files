Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 10th: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party has called on republicans, democrats, and working people to make July 14th a great day for defending the republic's democratic freedoms.

In a communique issued on the 9th, the Political Bureau called for mass meetings to be organized in the streets, countryside, and factories in the days leading up to the commemoration of July 14th to elect committees to defend the republic; torchlight processions, mass dances, and cultural evenings to be organized on July 13th; and grand popular demonstrations to be held on July 14th, making it a day to prepare for expressing a negative vote in the referendum and a day for the French people to express their republican will in an inspiring demonstration.

The communique pointed out that July 14th is one of the greatest days in the history of the French people, a day when the French people defeated the monarchy, the royalists, and the feudal and clerical reactionaries. It was a victory of freedom over oppression.

The communique continued, republican democratic freedoms have become stumbling blocks for warmongers and manufacturers of poverty. Therefore, they need to rely on conspirators in the army and police to achieve personal dictatorship, and to control the entire state machine in order to rule over the people who hope to obtain bread, peace, freedom, and a great future for France. Therefore, after forcibly establishing a government by threatening to launch a civil war, they are preparing to use a referendum to maintain this government.

The communique pointed out that any powerful demonstration expressing the democratic and republican will is an obstacle to their conspiracy and trickery. Therefore, it is all the more necessary to firmly declare that the French people will never allow themselves to be treated as a herd of political animals, that the French people do not want dictators to give them orders, and that they want peace, progress, and democracy.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 10th: The French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) issued a communique exposing the fascist atrocities of repeatedly attacking trade union headquarters, calling on all workers to hold strikes and demonstrations to protest, and to retaliate wherever rioters and riot organizations appear.

The communique said that the fascists are being protected by relevant parties, and trade union activists and workers must take strong action to defend their trade union headquarters and trade union organizations. Allowing rioters to run rampant, or expecting the police to stop their atrocities, is an extremely serious danger to trade union freedom. It should never be forgotten that this is how Mussolini's Blackshirts and Hitler's Stormtroopers started. Fascism must be severely cracked down on, and it must not be allowed to gain a foothold in our country; only the working class can take strong and resolute action to prevent fascism from succeeding.

Workers in many places have responded to the call of the General Confederation of Labor and have gone on strike.

    使7月14日成为保卫民主的日子
    法共号召举行反独裁示威
    总工会号召劳动者回击法西斯挑衅
    新华社巴黎10日电　法国共产党中央委员会政治局号召共和人士、民主人士和劳动人民使7月14日成为保卫共和国民主自由的伟大日子。
    政治局在9日发表的公报中要求在筹备纪念7月14日的这些天里，在街道、农村和工厂里组织群众大会以选举保卫共和国委员会，在7月13日组织火炬游行、群众舞会和文艺晚会，在7月14日举行盛大的人民示威游行，使这一天成为准备在全民投票时表示否定态度的日子，使这一天成为法国人民表示共和意志的振奋人心的示威日。
    公报指出，7月14日是法国人民历史上最伟大的日子之一，是法国人民战胜君主制、战胜保皇党、封建和教权反动派的日子。这是自由对压迫的胜利。
    公报继续说，共和民主自由已经成了战争狂热分子和穷困制造者的绊脚石。因此他们需要依靠军队和警察中的阴谋分子实现个人独裁，需要控制整个国家机器，借以统治希望获得面包、和平、自由和法国伟大前途的人民。因此，他们在以发动内战相威胁而强行建立了一个政府之后，又准备用举行全民投票的办法来把这个政府保持下去。
    公报指出，表达民主和共和意志的任何强大示威，都是他们实现阴谋诡计的障碍。所以更有必要坚决表明：法国人决不容许把他们当做一群政治动物来看待，法国人民不要独裁者来对他们发号施令，他们要和平、进步和民主。
    据新华社巴黎10日电　法国总工会发表公报，揭露法西斯分子多次袭击工会组织会址的暴行，号召全体劳动者举行罢工和示威游行表示抗议，并且在凡是出现暴乱分子和暴乱组织的地方予以还击。
    公报说，法西斯分子受到有关方面的庇护，工会积极分子和劳动者必须采取有力的行动来保卫他们的工会会址和工会组织，听任暴乱分子肆意横行，或者指望警察来阻止他们的暴行，对于工会自由来说是极其严重的危险。决不应该忘记，墨索里尼的黑衫党徒和希特勒的冲锋队就是这样开始的。必须狠狠打击法西斯主义，不准它在我国立足；只有工人阶级采取有力的坚决行动，才能使法西斯主义无法得逞。
    许多地方的工人响应总工会的号召举行了罢工。
