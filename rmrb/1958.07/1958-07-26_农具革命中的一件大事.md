A Major Event in the Agricultural Tool Revolution

The great leap forward in industry and agriculture has led to a shortage of labor. 1958 is only the beginning of the all-round great leap forward in China's socialist construction, only the first wave of the great leap forward. Next year, the scale and speed of the leap forward in all aspects will be even greater and faster, and the wave of the great leap forward will be even higher. It should be seen that with the expansion of the scale and the acceleration of the speed of the leap forward, the situation of labor shortage will become greater and greater. What to do? Should we, as advocated by the "watch-the-tide faction," reduce and delay the scale and speed of the leap forward? Of course not. That would keep us "in a state of poverty and lack of culture for a long time," would make us "unable to quickly stop possible foreign aggression" (Liu Shaoqi), and would cause us to commit historical mistakes. Then, should we strengthen labor intensity to strive for the scale and speed of the leap forward? It is unlikely and should not be done. The purpose of our building socialism and communism is not only to enable everyone to have a rich material life and a high cultural life, but also to liberate people from heavy physical labor. At that time, labor will no longer be simply a "means of making a living" but will become "the primary need in life" (Critique of the Gotha Program). Now, in order to accelerate socialist construction, each of us must infinitely improve our labor enthusiasm and initiative, but it is impossible to infinitely increase labor intensity. Improving the labor organization and management of agricultural cooperatives is one way; freeing the vast number of women's labor force from heavy housework to participate in agricultural production is another way. These methods can increase a huge labor force, but they are still not commensurate with the needs of China's construction leap forward. The leap forward is unlimited, and the labor force increased by this, no matter how huge, is always limited. The most fundamental and main method is to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification, but in the next year or two, it will not be possible to put more agricultural machinery into the countryside. At present, the most important method is to thoroughly reform old agricultural tools and earnestly promote improved agricultural tools. Countless facts have proved this truth, and more facts continue to prove it. Only by improving technology and placing China's agriculture on a modern technological basis can labor productivity be infinitely improved. Due to the widespread promotion of improved agricultural tools in Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, not only have the realization of various advanced indicators and advanced measures been guaranteed, but people have also begun to be liberated from heavy physical labor, realizing rhythmic production and labor. They have already implemented "working hard for five days," resting for one night, and holding a large-scale singing and entertainment party every ten days. Under the requirements of the advanced indicators of the great leap forward in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, the number of working days that each laborer should bear in this year's summer harvest and summer planting has increased from 22 in the past to 66. If tools are not reformed and labor efficiency is not improved, it will be impossible to complete the summer harvest and summer planting tasks in any way. Because they made ball bearings and widely promoted these improved agricultural tools installed with ball bearings, they increased labor productivity by more than two times, and each laborer only bore 20 workdays, and the summer harvest and summer planting tasks were completed. Like Fuyang, Anhui, Jun County, Henan Province, also installed ball bearings on many tools, which greatly improved labor efficiency, successfully realized the various indicators and measures of the great leap forward, and smoothly solved the problem of labor shortage.

It needs to be particularly pointed out here the important significance of widely adopting and installing ball bearings in various tools. Agricultural tool reform is the central issue in China's current agricultural production, and realizing ball bearingization in all rotating tools is the main link in the current agricultural tool reform. The road to the development of agricultural productivity in China is to make China's backward agricultural technology, through mass agricultural tool reform movements, reach modernization through improved agricultural tools, semi-mechanization, and mechanization. Only by placing China's agriculture on an advanced agricultural technology basis can China's agricultural productivity be thoroughly liberated and infinitely developed; China's agricultural production can leap forward on a larger scale and at a higher speed.

The meaning and content of improved agricultural tools are already familiar to everyone. But what is semi-mechanization? What should be the content and meaning of semi-mechanization? Under the specific conditions in China at present, semi-mechanization is to install ball bearings on all agricultural production tools powered by human and animal power, making all rotating tools bearingized. Bearings are the soul of all machinery. The height of ball bearing development and the extent of its use have always been important indicators for measuring a country's industrial level. Animal-powered agricultural tools plus bearings are China's semi-mechanization. Do not underestimate the important significance of the widespread adoption of ball bearings in agricultural production tools. This is an important factor in making China's agricultural technology level step into a new technical field. We must attach great importance to and adequately estimate the significance of semi-mechanization. It is the beginning of China's road to mechanization and the first step in China's agricultural mechanization.

Precisely because bearings are the soul of machinery and are products of modern large-scale industry, many people have mystified them, believing that only large factories and modern factories can manufacture them. The conservatives who see things but not people have lost again. Under the illumination of the Party's general line, the working people who have broken all superstitious ideas and established a communist style of daring to think, speak, and act are able to create all miracles. They have not only manufactured all kinds of native pesticides, but also many chemical fertilizers with different components, and now they have manufactured ball bearings. The widespread use of ball bearings on agricultural production tools started in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province. Subsequently, Jun County, Henan Province, also promoted the bearingization of agricultural tools. Whether it is Anhui or Henan, it shows that ball bearings are not some incomprehensible mysterious thing in the eyes of the working people! On the contrary, ball bearings are quite easy to manufacture. Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, used only seven days to successfully manufacture ball bearings in ten counties. In about a month, it established 793 factories for manufacturing ball bearings and manufactured 150,000 sets of ball bearings. By the end of August this year, the entire prefecture can realize the ball bearingization of rotating tools. The situation in Henan Province is the same. Jun County used only 20 days to establish ball bearing manufacturing plants in every township, and many agricultural cooperatives can also manufacture them. Now, six townships have realized ball bearingization on tools such as double-wheeled double-share plows, waterwheels, stone mills, and vehicles. It can be seen that promoting improved agricultural tools and realizing the bearingization of animal-powered agricultural tools is not mysterious and not as difficult as going to heaven and earth—in a socialist country where the working people are masters, there is no difficulty in going to heaven and earth. The coal, oil, and steel of the "eighteen levels of hell" have been and are being brought to the ground by us to serve the happy life of mankind; interstellar travel and flying to the universe are also becoming a reality. There is no difficulty in going to heaven and earth, so what difficulty will there be in realizing the bearingization of animal-powered tools in agricultural production? The problem lies in determination, in whether we recognize the significance and importance of bearingization, and in whether we have the "strong mass viewpoint" that Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us. What is politics? This is politics. The people of the whole country, especially the more than 500 million farmers, urgently demand a great leap forward in agricultural production and urgently demand the realization of agricultural mechanization and modernization in order to fundamentally solve the problem of labor shortage. If we do not give enough concern and support to these urgent demands of all the people, how can we talk about "caring about every pulse of the masses" (Lenin)? The Central Committee said in its report to the Eighth National Congress, Second Session: "Our revolution is to develop social productive forces as quickly as possible." Promoting improved agricultural tools and making all tools that can be installed with bearings ball bearingized is the fundamental measure for developing China's agricultural productive forces at present. Is it not the most important and significant political issue to underestimate or even ignore the promotion of bearingization, thereby delaying or even hindering the development and improvement of China's agricultural productive forces? Isn't it also a most full expression of a lack of mass viewpoint and a lack of concern for the sufferings of the masses?

The conservatives and watch-the-tide faction have always been like this: before you have made the facts for him to see, they always shake their heads and say "this is impossible and that is impossible"; and when people have already put the facts in front of him, they will say the old saying of "this is nothing great and not worth paying attention to at all." This time is the same. After their mysterious view of bearings was broken by the ordinary workers with facts, they started saying the old saying of "there is nothing great about it" again. The mysterious view of ball bearings is certainly wrong, and it is equally wrong to reduce its value to the point of being dispensable. Indeed, the ball bearings made by various places now are still elementary and rough. But what kind of advanced and exquisite things in the world do not develop from low-level and rough things? What's more, the facts are developing towards advanced and exquisite fields! Some of the ball bearings in Jun County, Henan, have already caught up with the Lion Globe brand ball bearings made in Tianjin, and the ball bearings made in Fuyang, Anhui, are not only on par with domestic products, but they are also confidently catching up with foreign products. What's more, in the current situation where China's agricultural production is still based on animal power as the basic power, there is no need for advanced ball bearings that rotate hundreds or thousands of revolutions per minute?

Just as the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong often tell us: we must implement the struggle between two lines in any work. In the agricultural tool reform movement and in the work of realizing the ball bearingization of tools, we must also implement the struggle between two lines. We must not only oppose the mysterious view of making ball bearings mysterious, but also oppose the nihilistic view of regarding the important significance of ball bearings in agricultural tool reform as insignificant. Both of these views are wrong and will hinder the further development of China's agricultural tool reform movement and the rapid improvement of China's agricultural productive forces. The correct attitude should be: it is not difficult to promote improved agricultural tools, and it is not difficult to realize the ball bearingization of tools. As long as we have the determination and plans of the comrades in Fuyang, Anhui, and Jun County, Henan, and firmly believe in and rely on the masses, we can complete this task in one or two months, or at most half a year, like them. We never underestimate the important significance of ball bearings. As Anhui and Henan have proved, it can increase labor productivity by one, two, or even more than ten times, thereby ensuring the successful realization of the advanced indicators and advanced measures of the great leap forward. Realizing the ball bearingization of agricultural production tools throughout the country can greatly develop China's agricultural productive forces, can put China's agricultural production technology on a semi-mechanized basis, and can open up broad roads for China's agricultural mechanization. In order to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest in autumn, strive to successfully complete the autumn harvest and autumn planting tasks, and welcome a greater agricultural production upsurge next year, let us launch a larger-scale and higher-momentum agricultural tool reform upsurge throughout the country and change the backward state of China's agricultural tools at the fastest speed! As long as we are determined, strengthen leadership, formulate plans, and rely on the masses, we will definitely be able to successfully complete this task, and we will definitely be able to replace old-style agricultural tools with improved agricultural tools entirely in half a year or less, and bearingize all tools that can be installed with bearings; we will definitely be able to rapidly develop China's agricultural productive forces and realize a larger-scale and higher-speed agricultural great leap forward.

    农具革命中的一件大事
    工农业大跃进，带来了劳动力的不足。1958年只是我国社会主义建设全面大跃进的一个开端，只是大跃进的第一个浪潮。明年，各方面跃进的规模和速度，将会更大更快，大跃进的浪潮将会越来越高。应该看出，随着跃进规模的扩大和速度的加快，劳动力不足的情况会愈来愈大。怎么办呢？像“观潮派”所主张的那样，缩小和延缓跃进的规模和速度吗？当然不能。那会使我们“长期处在贫穷和缺少文化的状况下”，会使我们“不能迅速地制止可能的外来侵略”（刘少奇），会使我们犯历史性的错误。那么，加强劳动强度以争取跃进的规模和速度吗？不大可能，也不应该。我们建设社会主义共产主义的目的，不仅要使人人都有丰富的物质生活和高度的文化生活，还要使人们从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来。到那时劳动不再单单是“谋生的手段”而成为“乐生的第一要素”（哥达纲领批判）。现在，为了加速社会主义建设，我们每一个人都要无限地提高自己的劳动热情和积极性，却不可能无限地增强劳动强度。改善农业社的劳动组织和经营管理，是一个办法；解除广大妇女劳动力的繁重的家务劳动去参加农业生产，又是一个办法。由这种种方法可以增加巨大的劳动力，但同我国各项建设跃进的需要比起来还是不相称的。跃进是无限的，而由此增加的劳动力无论怎样巨大，总是有限度的。最根本最主要的办法是实现农业机械化和电汽化，但这在最近一、二年内，还不可能有更多的农业机械投入农村。在目前最主要的办法还是彻底改革旧农具，认真推广改良农具。无数的事实已经证明了这条真理，还有更多的事实继续证明着。只有提高技术，把我国农业置于现代化的技术基础上以后，才能无限地提高劳动生产率。云南省的宜良县由于普遍推广了改良农具，不但保证了各项先进指标、先进措施的实现，人们也已经开始从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来，实现了有节奏的生产和劳动，他们已经实行了“大干五天”，休息一晚，十天举行一次大演大唱的娱乐晚会。安徽阜阳专区在大跃进的先进指标要求下，今年夏收夏种中每个劳动力应负担的劳动日，由过去的二十二个增加到六十六个，如果不改革工具，提高劳动效率，无论如何也不可能完成夏收夏种任务的。由于他们制成了滚珠轴承，并广泛推广了这种安装上滚珠轴承的改良农具，提高了劳动生产率两倍以上，每个劳动力只负担了二十个工，就把夏收夏种任务完成了。河南省浚县也和安徽阜阳的一样，也在很多工具上安装了滚珠轴承，极大地提高了劳动效率，胜利地实现了大跃进的各项指标和措施，顺利地解决了劳动力不足的问题。
    这里需要特别指出，在各种工具中广泛采用和安装滚珠轴承的重要意义。农具改革是当前我国农业生产中的中心问题，而在一切运转工具中实现滚珠轴承化，又是当前农具改革中的主要环节。我国农业生产力发展的道路，是通过群众性的农具改革运动，使我国落后的农业技术，经过改良农具、半机械化、机械化达到现代化。只有把我国的农业置于现代化的先进的农业技术基础上以后，我国的农业生产力，才能获得彻底的解放和无限的发展；我国的农业生产才能以更大的规模、更高的速度向前跃进。
    改良农具的含意和内容已是人人熟悉人人清楚的了。但什么是半机械化呢？半机械化的内容和含意应该是怎样的呢？在我国目前的具体条件下的半机械化，就是把一切以人力、畜力为动力的农业生产工具都安装上滚珠轴承，使一切运转工具轴承化。轴承是一切机械的灵魂。滚珠轴承发展的高度和使用的广泛程度，从来就是衡量一个国家工业水平的重要标志。畜力农具加轴承，就是我国农业的半机械化。不要小看滚珠轴承在农业生产工具中广泛采用的重要意义，这是使我国农业技术水平跨进一个新的技术领域的重要因素。要十分重视和足够估计半机械化的意义，它是使我国走上机械化的开始，是我国农业机械化的第一步。
    正因为轴承是机械的灵魂，是现代大工业的产物，许多人就把它神秘化起来，认为只有大工厂、现代工厂才能把它制造出来。见物不见人的保守派又输了。在党的总路线照耀下，破除了一切迷信思想，树立了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格的劳动人民，是能够创造出一切奇迹的。他们不仅制造出了各种各样的土农药，也制造出了很多成份不同的化学肥料，现在又制造出了滚珠轴承。滚珠轴承广泛运用到农业生产工具上是从安徽省的阜阳专区开始的。随后河南省的浚县也推行了农业工具轴承化。无论是安徽还是河南，都说明滚珠轴承在劳动人民面前，并不是什么不能理解的神秘物！相反，滚珠轴承倒是相当容易制造的。安徽阜阳专区，只用了七天的时间，就在十个县里制成功了滚珠轴承，一个月左右的时间，就建立了七百九十三个制造滚珠轴承的工厂，并制造出了十五万套滚珠轴承，今年8月底，全专区就可以实现运转工具滚珠轴承化。河南省也是一样，浚县只用了二十天的工夫，就在每一个乡镇上建立起滚珠轴承制造厂，而且许多农业社也能制造了。现在六个乡已经在双轮双铧犁、水车、石磨和车辆等工具上实现了滚珠轴承化。由此可见，推广改良农具，实现畜力农具轴承化，并不神秘，并不像上天入地那样困难——在劳动人民当家作主的社会主义国家里，上天入地也没有什么困难，“十八层地狱”的煤炭、石油、钢铁已经并正在被我们拿到地面上来，为人类的幸福生活服务；星际旅行，向宇宙飞翔也正在变成现实。上天入地都没有什么困难，实现农业生产中畜力工具轴承化还会有什么困难呢？问题是在于决心，在于是否认识轴承化的意义和重要性，在于我们有没有毛泽东同志经常教导我们的“坚强的群众观点”。什么是政治？这就是政治。全国人民，首先是五亿多农民迫切要求农业生产大跃进，迫切要求实现农业机械化现代化，以便从根本上解决劳力不足的问题。如果我们不对全体人民这些迫切要求给以足够的关心和支持，还谈得上什么“关心群众每一脉搏跳动”（列宁）呢？中央在向八大二次会议的报告中说：“我们的革命就是为了最迅速地发展社会生产力”。推广改良农具，使可能安装轴承的工具都滚珠轴承化正是当前发展我国农业生产力的根本措施。难道轻视甚至忽视推广轴承化，从而延缓甚至妨碍了我国农业生产力的发展和提高，不是最重要最重大的政治问题吗？难道还不是缺乏群众观点，不关心群众疾苦的一种最充分的表现吗？
    保守派观潮派从来就是这样的：当你还没有作出事实给他看以前，他们总是摇头摆脑地说“这不可能那不可能”；而当人们已经把事实摆在他面前以后，他们又会说“这没有什么了不起，根本不值得重视”。这次也是一样。他们的对轴承神秘观点被普通的劳动者用事实打破后，又说起“没有什么了不起”的老话了。对滚珠轴承的神秘观点固然不对，把它的身价降低到无所谓的地步同样错误。的确，现在各地自造的滚珠轴承还是初级的粗糙的。但是人世间有哪一种高级的精致的东西，不是从低级的粗糙的东西发展来的呢？何况事实也正向着高级和精致的领域发展呢！河南浚县的滚珠轴承有的已经赶上了天津制造的狮球牌滚珠，而安徽阜阳制造的滚珠轴承，不仅已经同国内产品不相上下，而且他们正在满怀信心地追赶外国产品。何况在目前我国农业生产仍以畜力为基本动力的情况下，根本不需要一分钟几百转、几千转的高级滚珠轴承呢？
    正像党中央和毛泽东同志经常告诉我们的：在任何工作中都要贯彻两条路线的斗争。在农具改革运动中，在实现工具滚珠轴承化的工作中，也必须贯彻两条路线的斗争。既要反对把滚珠轴承说得玄而又玄的神秘观点，也要反对把滚珠轴承在农具改革中的重要意义看得无足轻重的虚无主义观点。这两种观点都是错误的，都会妨害我国农具改革运动进一步发展，都会妨害我国农业生产力的迅速提高。正确的态度应该是：推广改良农具并不难，实现工具滚珠轴承化也不难，只要像安徽阜阳、河南浚县同志们那样有决心、有计划，坚决相信群众、依靠群众，就能像他们一样在一、两个月内，最多在半年之内完成这一任务。我们绝不轻视滚珠轴承的重要意义，如像安徽、河南已经证明了的，它能一倍、两倍以至十几倍地提高劳动生产率，从而保证了大跃进先进指标先进措施的胜利实现。在全国实现农业生产工具滚珠轴承化，就能够极大地发展我国的农业生产力，就能够把我国的农业生产技术置于半机械化的基础上，就能够为我国农业机械化开辟广阔的道路。为了争取秋季全面大丰收、争取顺利完成秋收秋种任务和迎接明年更大的农业生产高潮，让我们在全国各地掀起一个规模更大、声势更高的农具改革高潮，以最快的速度，改变我国的农具落后面貌吧。只要我们下定决心，加强领导，订出计划，依靠群众，我们就一定能够胜利完成这一任务，一定能够在半年或者更短的时间内，用改良农具全部的代替旧式农具，把一切能够安装轴承的工具轴承化；就一定能够迅速地发展我国的农业生产力，实现更大规模、更高速度的农业大跃进。
