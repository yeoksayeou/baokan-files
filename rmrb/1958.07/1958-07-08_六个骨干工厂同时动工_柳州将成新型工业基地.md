    Six Backbone Factories Start Construction Simultaneously
    Liuzhou to Become a New Type of Industrial Base
    (Xinhua News Agency) The construction of six backbone factories in the Liuzhou Industrial Zone of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region officially commenced on July 1st. These factories are: the Liuzhou Iron and Steel Plant, the Liuzhou Thermal Power Plant, the Liuzhou Fertilizer Plant, the Liuzhou Cement Plant, the Liuzhou Machine Repair Plant, and the Liuzhou Paper Mill.
    This batch of factories are above-quota factories invested in and constructed by the Central Government and the Autonomous Region during the Second Five-Year Plan, and are of considerable scale. They will be built in two phases, and it is expected that after they are all completed by 1962, they will be able to produce 2 million tons of pig iron, 1.5 million tons of steel, 620,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, 500,000 tons of cement, 76,000 tons of newsprint, and have a power generation capacity of 200,000 kilowatts annually.
    Chu Fangzhen, Deputy Secretary of the Liuzhou Municipal Party Committee and Mayor of Liuzhou, said that the construction of these six backbone factories marks that Liuzhou will become a new type of industrial base in the Autonomous Region.
    Liuzhou is a hub of the Xiang-Gui and Qian-Gui railways, adjacent to the left bank of the Liujiang River. Highways radiate in all directions from Liuzhou, and there are abundant coal and iron resources nearby. Therefore, the conditions for building an industrial base here are quite superior.

    六个骨干工厂同时动工
    柳州将成新型工业基地
    据新华社讯  广西僮族自治区柳州工业区7月1日正式动工建设六个骨干工厂——柳州钢铁厂、柳州热电站、柳州化肥厂、柳州水泥厂、柳州机修厂和柳州造纸厂。
    这批工厂是广西僮族自治区在第二个五年计划期间，由中央和自治区投资兴建的限额以上的工厂，规模相当大。分两期建设，预计到1962年全部建成以后，每年可以生产生铁二百万吨，钢一百五十万吨，化肥六十二万吨，水泥五十万吨，新闻纸七万六千吨，发电能力二十万瓩。
    中共柳州市委副书记、柳州市市长褚方珍说，这六个骨干工厂的建设，标志着柳州将要成为自治区一个新型的工业基地。
    柳州是湘桂、黔桂两大铁路的枢纽，紧靠柳江左岸，以柳州为中心的公路四通八达，附近又有丰富的煤铁等资源。因此在这里建设工业基地，条件相当优越。
