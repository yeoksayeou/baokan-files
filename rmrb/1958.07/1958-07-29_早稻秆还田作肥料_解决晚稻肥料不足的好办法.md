Returning Early Rice Straw to the Field as Fertilizer
—A Good Way to Solve the Problem of Insufficient Fertilizer for Late Rice

    Rice straw is a good organic fertilizer. According to scientific analysis, calculated by dry matter content, 1,000 pounds of rice straw contains approximately 800 pounds of organic matter, 6.3 pounds of nitrogen (equivalent to 30 pounds of ammonium sulfate), 1.1 pounds of phosphorus pentoxide (equivalent to 6 pounds of superphosphate), and 8.5 pounds of potassium oxide (equivalent to 17 pounds of potassium sulfate). Applying rice straw can add a large amount of organic matter to the soil, improve the soil, supply plant nutrients, and increase soil fertility. Therefore, using rice straw as fertilizer is a good way to expand fertilizer sources by using locally available materials, which is both convenient and economical, and it is worthy of promotion.
    In some areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other provinces, farmers have the habit of using rice straw to return to the field as fertilizer. That is, fresh early rice straw is directly plowed and turned over in the field, acting as the base fertilizer for double-cropping late rice. The yield-increasing effect of using rice straw returned to the field as fertilizer is very good. According to the experience of farmers in Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, late rice with early rice straw returned to the field generally yields 50 to 60 catties more rice per mu than without. According to the experience of Foshan Prefecture, Guangdong Province, late rice with early rice straw returned to the field can generally increase production by about 10%. According to experiments by the Zhejiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, late rice with early rice straw as base fertilizer yields 53.8 catties more rice per mu than without, an increase of 12%.
    There are two methods for using early rice straw to return to the field. One is to use the method of cutting the rice high and turning over the remaining stalks in place. That is, when harvesting early rice, only cut off the upper part of the rice stalk, five to six inches away from the rice ears, so that the lower part of the rice stalk is left longer in the field. After harvesting, immediately use a wooden roller to roll and crush the rice stalks left in the field, causing them to fall onto the mud surface, then plow and turn them into the soil, level the field, and flood it with shallow water. After soaking for about a week, the rice stalks will soften, and then carry out another harrowing. After harrowing, continue to soak for about a week, and then the land can be prepared for transplanting. The other method is to cut the harvested rice stalks into several sections, each about six or seven inches long, and spread them evenly in the field, and then take the same treatment methods as above for plowing, harrowing, and soaking. If it is an intercropping paddy field, the second method can be adopted to evenly spread the cut rice stalks between the rows of late rice, and then carry out weeding so that the rice stalks are mixed into the topsoil. After about a week, carry out another weeding to promote decay. In some areas, if the season is tight and there is no time to directly use rice straw to return to the field, the rice straw can be made into compost or liquid fertilizer, and applied after composting and fermenting.
    According to the experience of various places, the following points should be noted when using rice straw to return to the field as fertilizer: (1) Turn it over as early as possible. Generally, it should be turned over more than half a month before transplanting late rice, so that there is sufficient time for the rice straw to rot. If the time for returning to the field is too late, the fermented rice straw may burn the transplanted seedlings. (2) Apply in appropriate amounts. Generally speaking, according to the current general situation, it is more appropriate to use the rice straw from one mu of field on about two mu of late rice field. Too much application is not only difficult to rot, but also makes transplanting difficult, and it will also cause floating root phenomenon, affecting seedling growth. (3) When using rice straw to return to the field, when harrowing, pay attention to harrowing the rice straw evenly and dispersing it, not piling it up. On the one hand, avoid uneven fertilizer distribution in the field due to uneven rice straw distribution, which affects uneven rice growth; on the other hand, prevent incomplete rice straw rot and continued fermentation from burning the seedlings to death, resulting in missing plants. (4) Cooperate with the application of some quick-acting nitrogen fertilizers. The fertilizer effect of rice straw is slow, and it cannot exert its fertilizer effect until it has been decomposed and fermented; moreover, rice straw applied to the ground relies on the action of soil microorganisms to decompose, and soil microorganisms need to absorb nitrogen nutrients from the soil to maintain life. This will temporarily reduce the nitrogen nutrients in the soil, causing nitrogen deficiency, causing seedlings to turn yellow and wither, and not returning to green for a long time, affecting seedling growth and development. In order to prevent this from happening, while using rice straw to return to the field, some quick-acting nitrogen fertilizers such as fermented human and animal manure and ammonium sulfate should be applied in combination. The amount of quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer can be determined according to specific conditions, and approximately one dan of manure water should be applied for every hundred catties of dry rice straw. (5) In acidic soil areas in the south, some lime can also be applied in combination, which can accelerate the decay of rice straw and neutralize the acidic substances produced during the decomposition of rice straw. The general application rate is about 50 catties per mu.
    Using early rice straw to return to the field is an effective way to solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer for late rice. In areas where fuel, feed, and sideline raw materials are not lacking, returning rice straw to the field is a positive way to expand fertilizer sources for late rice fields.

    早稻秆还田作肥料
    ——解决晚稻肥料不足的好办法
    邓锡鎏
    稻秆是一种良好的有机肥料。根据科学分析，按干物质含量计算，一千斤稻秆约含有机质八百斤，氮素六点三斤（相当于三十斤硫酸铵），磷酸一点一斤（相当于六斤过磷酸钙），氧化钾八点五斤（相当于硫酸钾十七斤）。施用稻秆可以给土壤增加大量的有机质，改良土壤，供应植物养料，提高土壤肥力。所以，利用稻秆作肥料是一种就地取材、既方便又经济的扩大肥源的好办法，值得提倡推广。
    在浙江、福建、广东等省部分地区，农民有利用稻秆还田作肥料的习惯，这就是把新鲜的早稻稻秆直接犁耕翻压在田里，充作双季晚稻的基肥。利用稻秆还田作肥料的增产效果很好。浙江省诸暨县农民的经验，一般施用早稻秆还田的晚稻，要比不施用的每亩增产稻谷五、六十斤。广东省佛山专区的经验，利用早稻秆还田的晚稻，一般能增产10％左右。另据浙江省农业科学研究所的试验，施用早稻秆作基肥的晚稻，比不施的每亩多收稻谷五十三点八斤，增产12％。
    利用早稻秆还田的方法有两种。一种是采用高槎割禾就地留秆翻压的方法。即在收割早稻时，只割取稻秆上部离稻穗五到六寸的地方，使稻秆下部留长一些在田里。收割后，随即用木辊把留在田里的稻秆滚压折裂，倒伏泥面，然后犁耕翻压入土，耙平，灌入浅水淹浸。浸沤一星期左右，稻秆已变软，再进行一次耙田，耙后继续浸沤一星期左右，便可整地插秧。另一种方法是把割下的稻秆截成几段，每段约六、七寸长，均匀地撒在田里，然后采取和上述同样的处理方法进行犁耙、浸沤。如果是间作稻田，可以采取第二种方法，将已切短的稻秆均匀地撒在晚稻行间，然后进行耘田，使稻秆混和于表土中，经过一星期左右，再进行一次耘田，促使腐烂。有些地区如因季节紧迫，来不及直接利用稻秆还田的，可以把稻秆制成堆肥或沤肥，经过堆沤腐熟然后施用。
    根据各地经验，利用稻秆还田作肥料，要注意下面几点：（1）及早翻压。一般应在晚稻插秧前半个月以上翻压，以便有充分时间使稻秆能够沤烂。如果还田时间过晚，由于稻秆发酵，可能烧坏插下的秧苗。（2）适量施用。稻秆还田用量，按现有一般情况来说，大致以一亩田的稻秆用在两亩左右晚稻田较合适。施用过多，不但不易腐烂，插秧也有困难，同时还会引起浮根现象，影响秧苗生长。（3）利用稻秆还田，耙田时要注意把稻秆耙匀、耙散，不可成堆。一方面避免由于稻秆分布不匀，田里肥分不匀，影响水稻生长不齐；另一方面防止稻秆腐熟不透，继续发酵烧死秧苗，造成缺株。（4）配合施用一些速效性氮肥。稻秆肥效较迟缓，未经分解腐熟时，是不能发挥肥效的；而且稻秆施在地里，要靠土壤微生物的作用来进行分解，土壤微生物是需要从土壤中吸取氮素养料来维持生活的。这样就会使得土壤里氮素养分暂时减少一些，发生缺氮现象，引起秧苗黄萎，迟迟不返青，影响秧苗的生长发育。为了防止这种情况的发生，利用稻秆还田的同时，应当配合施用一些腐熟人粪尿、硫酸铵等速效性氮肥。速效性氮肥用量，可根据具体条件决定，大概一百斤干稻草，要配施一担粪水。（5）在南方酸性土壤地区，还可以配合施用一些石灰，可使稻秆加速腐烂，并中和稻秆在分解时所产生的酸性物质。一般每亩施用量约五十斤左右。
    利用早稻秆还田是解决晚稻肥料不足的一种有效办法。在燃料、饲料和副业原料不缺的地区，稻秆还田是为晚稻田扩大肥源的一个积极办法。
