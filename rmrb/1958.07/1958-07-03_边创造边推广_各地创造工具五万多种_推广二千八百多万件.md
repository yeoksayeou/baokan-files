　　Creating and Promoting Simultaneously
　　Over 50,000 Types of Tools Created in Various Regions, Over 28 Million Pieces Promoted
　　(Our report) According to incomplete statistics, as of now, the masses in twenty-four provinces, regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, including Henan, Hunan, Gansu, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Liaoning, Fujian, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Beijing, Guangdong, Shanghai, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, Jilin, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, have created and improved 55,569 new tools. Sixteen provinces, regions, and Beijing have already promoted over 28,199,000 pieces of various improved tools. Currently, the focus of tool reform has shifted to harvesting, transportation, threshing, and weeding.
　　During this phase, the tool reform movement is being conducted under more leadership and organization. At the central level, in addition to holding the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, the Ministry of Agriculture and the First Ministry of Machine Building jointly organized approximately one hundred agricultural machinery personnel to go to the countryside and mountains to support the tool reform movement. Many regions have also adopted forms such as exhibitions, on-site meetings, and appraisal and promotion meetings to promote the development of this movement. Many regions have also established specialized institutions such as technical reform committees and tool reform offices to vigorously organize local industry and handicrafts to produce new tools in large quantities, with Henan Province achieving the most significant results. From January to April, the province created and improved 21,107 types of tools, manufacturing and promoting 11,219,688 pieces. The characteristics of this province's leadership in the tool reform movement are: closely integrating with current production, promptly adopting various effective measures, ensuring the completion of arduous production tasks, and promoting the tool reform movement.
　　However, the responsible business departments in some individual provinces and regions have not only failed to take active measures to lead this movement, but they are also unaware of the progress of the local tool reform movement. It is urgent to change this situation and catch up.

    边创造边推广
    各地创造工具五万多种　推广二千八百多万件
    本报讯　根据不完全的统计，到目前为止，河南、湖南、甘肃、云南、浙江、江西、江苏、安徽、广西、山西、四川、辽宁、福建、贵州、黑龙江、北京、广东、上海、山东、河北、陕西、吉林、青海、新疆等二十四个省、区和直辖市的群众创造和改良的新工具有五万五千五百六十九种；十六个省区和北京市已经推广各种改良工具二千八百一十九万九千多件。目前，改革工具的重点，已转向收割、运输、打场、耘田等方面。
    这一阶段中，工具改革运动是在更有领导、有组织的情况下进行的。中央一级除举办了全国农具展览会外，农业、第一机械工业两部又联合组织一百人左右的农业机械工作人员下乡上山，支援工具改革运动。许多地区也都分别采取展览会、现场会、评比促进会等形式推动这一运动的发展。许多地区并且成立了技术改革委员会、工具改革办公室等专门机构，大力组织当地的地方工业和手工业大量制作新工具，其中以河南省的成绩最为显著。该省自1至4月共创造和改良工具二万一千一百零七种，制造推广了一千一百二十一万九千六百八十八件。这个省领导工具改革运动的特点是：紧密结合当前生产，及时采取各种有效措施，既保证完成繁重的生产任务，又促进了工具改革运动。
    但是，也有个别省区的主管业务部门不仅没有采取积极措施，领导这一运动，甚至连当地工具改革运动开展情况都不了解。亟需改变这种情况，迎头赶上。
