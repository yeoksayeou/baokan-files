Despite Labor Shortages, Timely Harvesting and Planting Must Be Ensured
Jiaxing Special District Rushes Day and Night to Produce New Farm Tools

According to Zhejiang Daily news: In order to solve the difficulty of labor shortages during the rush harvest and planting season, the Jiaxing Special District of Zhejiang Province has organized more than 30,000 handicraft workers and carpenters within agricultural cooperatives to work day and night to rush-produce various rush-harvesting and planting tools such as harvesters, large sickles, threshing machines, tandem harrows, and rice transplanters. They are determined to fight hard for twenty days to produce 600,000 tools, so that most of the farm work in the district's rush harvesting and planting can be done with new tools, ensuring a complete victory in the rush harvesting and planting.

Around June 20th, the District Committee successively convened district-wide farm tool meetings and meetings of the agricultural, commercial, and handicraft systems, analyzed the situation across the district, and decided to focus on solving tool needs in six areas: harvesting, threshing, cultivation, fertilizer transportation, and water lifting. It was required to vigorously promote tools that are simple to manufacture, highly efficient, low in cost, and easy to use. 360,000 harvesters and large sickles will be promoted, so that every team has harvesters and every household has large sickles. The number of threshing machines will be increased and refitted by 15,000, ensuring that more than 80% of the rice paddies use threshing machines. 30,000 five-铧 plows and tandem harrows, 3,000 rice transplanters, 100,000 various fertilizer transport vehicles and boats, and 110,000 refitted enclosed waterwheels will be promoted. At the same time, new-style tools such as harvesters, grain dryers, and automatic windmills will be actively promoted. It is required to have an average of three new-style tools per household. In this way, the entire district can save 10.5 million workdays.

In order to solve the manufacturing technical problems, the District Committee and various counties held farm tool exhibitions, using technical training classes and on-site meetings to impart technology. More than 1,000 technical backbones have now been trained. In order to accelerate the manufacture of various tools, the handicraft system has already rushed to produce more than 45,000 major tools such as threshing machines, tandem harrows, and rice transplanters. The commercial system has dispatched more than 400 cadres to various places to purchase raw materials and various advanced tools. Various localities have also tried every possible means to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials by using methods such as recycling old materials for smelting, going up the mountains to mine, and using substitutes.

    劳力不足也要保证及时收种
    嘉兴专区日夜赶制新农具
    据浙江日报消息　浙江省嘉兴专区为了解决抢收抢种中劳力不足的困难，组织手工业工人和农业社内的木匠三万多人，夜以继日地赶制收割器、大镰刀、打稻机、连作耙、插秧机等各种抢收抢种工具，决心苦战二十天，抢制工具六十万件，使全区抢收抢种中大部农活都能使用新工具，保证抢收抢种获得全胜。
    6月20日左右，地委连续召开了全区农具会议和农业、商业、手工业系统会议，分析了全区情况，决定重点解决收割、脱粒、耕作、运肥、提水等六方面的工具。要求大力推广那些制造简单、效率高、成本低、使用简便的工具。推广收割器和大镰刀三十六万件，达到队队有收割器，户户有大镰刀。增加和改装打稻机一万五千台，保证80％以上的水稻使用打稻机。推广五铧犁、连作耙三万台，插秧机三千台，各种运肥车、船十万只，改装封闭式水车十一万部。同时积极推广收割机，烘谷机，自动风车等新式工具。要求达到平均每户有三件新式工具。这样全区就可以节约劳力一千零五十万工。
    为了解决制造技术问题，地委和各县举办了农具展览会，用技术传授训练班和现场会议传授技术，现已训练技术骨干一千多人。为了加速制造各种工具，手工业系统目前已赶制好打稻机、连作耙、插秧机等主要工具四万五千多件。商业系统已派出四百多名干部，分赴各地采购原材料及各种先进工具。各地还千方百计地想办法，利用收旧回炉、上山开采、利用代用品等办法来解决原材料不足的困难。
