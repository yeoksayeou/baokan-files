Chengde Special District, which is very rich in oil shale, recently refined its first batch of petroleum using indigenous methods in Fengning and Weichang. Up to now, the Chengde Special District has discovered twenty-one oil shale mineral sites, with a mining area of more than 600 square kilometers, distributed in Fengning, Weichang, Luanping, Chengde, and Longhua counties. Among them, the deposits in Dage and Fengshan in Fengning and Qingquan and Mengkui in Weichang are the largest. According to preliminary estimates by the Chengde Geological Team of the Hebei Geological Bureau, the reserves of these four major mining areas are in the tens of billions of tons. Many ore bodies are exposed on the ground. The grade of many ore bodies is also good, generally containing about 5% oil, and the highest reaching 11%. Although further exploration is still needed and no final conclusions have been reached, the current situation shows great promise in terms of both quantity and quality.

The Chengde Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chengde Commissioner's Office, in accordance with the principle of simultaneously promoting large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, decided to develop the local petroleum industry by combining mechanical mining and indigenous oil refining methods. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, four large-scale oil factories will be built in Fengning and Weichang; small-scale oil factories will be established in Luanping, Longhua, Chengde, Pingquan, Qinglong and other counties, and indigenous oil refining and dry distillation and pile refining oil plants will be vigorously developed in various counties. The region will produce 50,000 tons of crude oil this year, and it is expected to reach 1 million tons by 1962.

    承德专区炼出石油
    本报讯　蕴藏油母页岩十分丰富的承德专区，不久以前在丰宁、围场两地用土法炼出了第一批石油。承德专区到目前为止，已发现油母页岩矿点二十一处，矿区面积达六百余平方公里，分布在丰宁、围场、滦平、承德、隆化等县，其中以丰宁的大阁、凤山和围场的清泉、孟奎四处藏量最多，据河北地质局承德地质队初步估计：这四处主要矿区的储量都数以百亿吨计。许多矿体都裸露在地面。很多矿体的品位也不错，一般都含油5％左右，最高的达11％，虽然还需要继续进行勘探，没有得出最后的结论，但就现有情况来看，无论在数量上和质量上都大有希望。
    中共承德地委和承德专员公署根据大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，决定采取机械开采和土法炼油相结合的办法开发本地的石油工业。在第二个五年计划期间，将在丰宁、围场两地兴建四座大型石油厂；在滦平、隆化、承德、平泉、青龙等县建立小型石油厂，并将在各县大搞土法炼油和建立干馏堆炼油厂。全区今年即可产原油五万吨，到1962年可达到一百万吨。
