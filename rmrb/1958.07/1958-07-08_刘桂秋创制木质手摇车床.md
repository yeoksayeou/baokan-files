According to a report in the *New Hunan Daily*, Liu Guiqiu, a worker at the Joint Factory in Hengshi Township, Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, recently overcame numerous difficulties and successfully trial-produced a wooden hand-crank six-foot lathe with the assistance of carpenter Zhang Dixuan. This lathe does not require a power mechanism to operate and can process various mechanical parts. Liu Guiqiu, the worker who manufactured this lathe, used to be a coppersmith and only had two years of schooling. As early as the summer of the year before last, he wanted to invent a lathe. However, at that time, his personal financial and material resources were limited, and his wish was not realized. This year, with the great development of local industry in Ningxiang, he joined the Joint Factory and became even more determined to create a wooden lathe. In early May, the factory sent him to visit factories in the county seat and Changsha, where he carefully observed and analyzed lathes, learning a lot of knowledge about manufacturing lathes. At a technical research group meeting, he talked about his plans. The township and factory leaders strongly supported him, and carpenter Zhang Dixuan also volunteered to assist him. Liu Guiqiu was full of energy. He first used a flywheel and two gears from a cotton gin, and installed a hand crank on the flywheel, solving the first and most crucial problem in manufacturing the lathe. Subsequently, he made one himself in the form of a chuck using iron, and the workpiece could also be clamped very firmly. For things that could be replaced with wood, he used strong hardwood, such as wooden beds, wooden pillows, and wooden pressure plates. During the manufacturing and trial use of the lathe, he manufactured many parts such as the axles of waterwheels, meeting the urgent needs of the time.

    刘桂秋创制木质手摇车床
    据新湖南报报道  湖南省宁乡县横市乡联合工厂工人刘桂秋最近在木工张迪轩的协助下，突破重重困难，试制成了一部木制手摇六尺车床。这部车床不要动力机械带动，也能进行多种机械零件的加工。制造这部车床的工人刘桂秋，过去做过铜匠，只读过两年书。前年夏天，他就想发明一部车床。但是，当时他个人财力物力单薄，愿望没有实现。今年，宁乡地方工业大发展，他加入了联合工厂，更下定决心要创造木制车床。5月上旬，厂里派他到县城和长沙等地参观工厂，他一看到车床就仔细观察分析，对制造车床学到了不少知识。在一次技术研究小组会上，他把自己的打算谈了出来，当时乡和厂的负责同志都大力支持他，木工张迪轩也主动表示愿协助他。刘桂秋浑身是劲，首先利用一部棉花机上的一个飞轮和两个齿轮，在飞轮上装手摇柄，解决了制造车床的第一个带关键性问题。随后又按卡盘形式自己用铁打了一个，工件也能卡得很稳当。能用木代替的东西，他都用质量牢的硬木代替，例如木床、木枕和木压板等。在车床边制造边试用的过程中就制造出了水车上的轴心等许多零件，满足了当时的迫切需要。
