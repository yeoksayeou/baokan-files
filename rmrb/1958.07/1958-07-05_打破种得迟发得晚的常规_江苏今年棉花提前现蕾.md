Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 4th: Good news from Jiangsu's cotton-growing areas: People's soaring enthusiasm has broken seasonal conventions, and cotton has begun to bud twenty days earlier than last year.

In the new cotton-growing area of Siyang County, cotton began to bud on June 10th. The 250,000 mu of cotton have lush branches and leaves, and the growth is even better than the high-yield experimental fields of last year. In Changshu County, 30% of the 400,000 mu of cotton fields have already budded. In the Nantong cotton area, the cotton growing well in the 3.5 million mu of cotton fields has also begun to bud one after another.

This year, cotton planting in Jiangsu was about 20 days earlier than last year, and the planting quality was very good, basically achieving "five eliminations": good land preparation, eliminating weeds; good seed dressing with pesticides, eliminating underground pests; good ditching and ridging, eliminating waterlogging during the seedling stage; good seed selection, eliminating late seedlings; and abundant base fertilizer, eliminating planting in barren fields. These technical measures have all promoted the early budding of cotton.

Another important reason for the early budding of cotton is the early management of cotton fields. The double-cropping area of cotton and wheat broke the convention of starting cotton field management only after the summer harvest and planting. Before harvesting wheat, soil loosening and weeding were generally carried out in the wheat rows. The Huaiyin Special District established a system of special personnel responsible for managing cotton fields from the special district, county, and township down to the commune and team, with responsibility assigned to the end. Even during the busiest time of the summer harvest and planting, the counties ensured that both the rush to harvest and plant and the management of cotton fields were carried out without neglecting either.

Jiangsu Province has a total of 10.05 million mu of cotton fields, more than 80% of which are double-cropped with cotton and wheat. In the past, due to late planting and late cotton development, yield and quality were often affected. For example, during the peak budding and flowering period, typhoons often struck, often causing a large number of buds and bolls to fall off. Cotton bolls that formed late would not mature due to the drop in temperature, becoming frost-damaged flowers. Therefore, in order to strive for a bumper harvest, agricultural cooperatives in cotton-growing areas put forward the slogan "Cotton must mature early!"

### 打破种得迟发得晚的常规  江苏今年棉花提前现蕾

    打破种得迟发得晚的常规
    江苏今年棉花提前现蕾
    新华社南京4日电　江苏棉区传来喜讯：人们的冲天干劲，打破了季节常规，棉花比去年提前二十天开始现蕾。
    新棉区泗阳县的棉花在6月10日就开始现蕾，二十五万亩棉花枝叶茂盛，长势比去年的丰产试验田还要好。常熟县四十万亩棉田已有30％现蕾。南通棉区三百五十万亩棉田中长得好的棉花也先后现蕾。
    今年江苏棉花播种比去年提前二十天左右，播种质量很好，基本上做到了“五消灭”：整地好，消灭了杂草；药剂拌种好，消灭了地下虫害，开沟理墒好，消灭了苗期涝害；种子粒选好，消灭了晚苗；基肥多，消灭了白田下种。这些技术措施都促使棉花提前现蕾。
    棉花提前现蕾的另一个重要原因是棉田管理抓得早。棉麦两熟田地区打破了夏收夏种结束后才开始管理棉花的常规。在割麦前就普遍在麦行中进行松土、锄草等工作。淮阴专区从专区、县、乡直到社、队建立了专人负责制管理棉田，包干到底。就是在夏收夏种最紧张的时候，各县也做到了抢收抢种和棉田管理两不误。
    江苏省共有棉田一千零五十万亩，80％以上是棉麦两熟田。过去由于种得迟，棉花发得晚，产量和质量常受影响。例如正当盛蕾开花时期，常遇台风侵袭，往往造成大量蕾铃脱落。结得迟的棉铃就会因温度下降不能成熟，成为霜后花。因此，棉区农业社为了争取大丰收，提出了“要棉花提早成熟”的口号。
