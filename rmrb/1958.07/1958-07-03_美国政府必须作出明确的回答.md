    Due to the wanton sabotage by the U.S. side, the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks have been interrupted for nearly seven months. Although the Chinese side has made many efforts to urge the U.S. government to change its attitude so that the talks can be conducted effectively, there has been no result. Under these circumstances, our government issued a statement on June 30, demanding that the U.S. government send an ambassadorial representative within fifteen days from that date to resume the talks; otherwise, it cannot but be considered that the U.S. has decided to break off the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks. This is obviously quite reasonable and absolutely necessary. It expresses the firm will of the entire Chinese people that they will not allow the U.S. side to continue to interrupt and sabotage the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks indefinitely. Whether the U.S. government has the sincerity to negotiate should and must be given a clear and unambiguous answer.
    However, judging from the statements made by U.S. State Department press officer White on June 30 and Secretary of State Dulles on July 1, the U.S. government is still adopting a vague and ambiguous attitude, refusing to give a clear answer to the questions raised in our government's statement. On the one hand, White and Dulles stated that the U.S. was "actively considering" selecting a new ambassador; on the other hand, they said that the U.S. would not "succumb to so-called ultimatums" to evade answering the question directly. At the same time, they greatly distorted the original purpose of the Sino-U.S. talks and the actual course of the talks, attempting to confuse the public and shift the responsibility for the long-term disruption and interruption of the Sino-U.S. talks onto the Chinese people.
    This plan of the U.S. government is absolutely impossible to succeed. The responsibility for the long-term interruption of the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks cannot be denied by the U.S. government at all. The Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, which began as early as 1955, were held based on the agreement reached by both sides. The fact that these Sino-U.S. talks have been interrupted for nearly seven months and still cannot be resumed is entirely the result of the U.S. government arbitrarily breaking the agreement between China and the U.S. on holding ambassadorial talks and refusing to send ambassadorial representatives to continue the talks. On the contrary, the Chinese side has made continuous efforts to enable the talks to resume as soon as possible. On January 14 and March 26 of this year, the U.S. government was repeatedly urged to send ambassadorial representatives to resume the talks. However, the U.S. government always delayed and refused to send ambassadorial representatives, even disregarding the basic etiquette between nations, believing that there was no need to even reply to the Chinese side's letter of March 26. This imperialist attitude of the U.S., which openly violates international agreements and unilaterally interrupts talks, has not only aroused great indignation among the Chinese people but has also aroused dissatisfaction among the American people and fair world opinion. The U.S. government's attempt to bring out Martin, a first secretary from its embassy in London, to cover up the fact that it is not sending an ambassadorial representative cannot deceive anyone. Therefore, the responsibility for the long-term interruption of the Sino-U.S. talks lies entirely with the U.S. side. Isn't this very clear?
    Now, White's statement at the U.S. State Department puts forward baseless "certain facts" in an attempt to prove that it is not the U.S. but China that is disrupting the Sino-U.S. talks. White lifted a stone and did not hit others, but hit the U.S. itself.
    White said that China has "violated" the agreement on the return of civilians. This is obviously a reversal of black and white. From the day the Sino-U.S. reached an agreement on the return of civilians, the Chinese side has been conscientiously implementing this agreement. All American civilians in China who expressed their desire to return to their country have been given all possible conditions by the Chinese government to allow them to return. This is an undeniable fact for anyone. As for the American prisoners detained in China, that is a completely different matter, because civilians and prisoners cannot be confused. Americans who have violated the law in China will be punished by Chinese law. These prisoners will of course not be able to return to their country before they have served their sentences. Moreover, in fact, most of these American prisoners have now been released. Of the original forty American prisoners, only four remain. Therefore, the U.S. State Department's attempt to forcibly link the prisoner issue with the issue of the return of civilians in order to evade its responsibility for interrupting the Sino-U.S. talks is fundamentally impossible. Similarly, the U.S.'s attempt to use this method to cover up its crime of detaining Chinese civilians in violation of the agreement is also fundamentally impossible. Everyone knows that because the U.S. government has not fulfilled the obligations stipulated in the agreement, tens of thousands of Chinese civilians in the U.S. have not had the opportunity to express their desire to return to their country, let alone the freedom to return. Even some of those who have requested to return have been subjected to all kinds of obstruction and persecution by the U.S. government and have still not been able to return to their motherland. The U.S. side has consistently refused to thoroughly explain these situations. In the Sino-U.S. talks, in order to cope with our questioning, the U.S. side once notified our side that it had allowed 103 Chinese civilians in the U.S. to return to their country. However, even among these 103, 21 are still being detained by the U.S. As for the 56 Chinese civilians who requested to return to their country, which we presented to the U.S. side, 49 are still being detained by the U.S. To this day, aren't all these facts enough to prove who violated the agreement on the return of civilians?
    White also said that the Chinese side "refused to account for the missing American soldiers in the Korean War." This is even more unfounded and unreasonable. Long before the Sino-U.S. talks, the issue of American prisoners of war no longer existed. In the Sino-U.S. talks, the Chinese side made a convincing response to this issue. Therefore, White's slander is not worth refuting. However, if it is necessary to raise the issue of prisoners of war in the Korean War, then it is not the U.S. side that has the right to speak, but the Chinese and Korean sides. Before and after the Korean armistice, the U.S. side used inhuman and barbaric means to detain 48,000 Chinese and Korean prisoners of war (including 14,000 Chinese). All honest people in the world will never forget this heinous crime of the U.S. The Chinese and Korean sides have the right at any time to raise this issue with the U.S. side and demand a settlement of this blood debt.
    White's statement also touched on the Taiwan issue. According to White, China's "refusal to renounce the use of force against the Taiwan area" seems to be a reason why the Sino-U.S. talks have not achieved results. However, this is just a long-bankrupt sophistry. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the relationship between the Chinese government and the local authorities in the Taiwan area is entirely China's internal affair. The Chinese people have the sacred right to exercise Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan in any way they see fit, and no country has the right to interfere. As for the dispute between China and the U.S. in the Taiwan area, China has always advocated a peaceful solution and has put forward a series of proposals on this issue in the Sino-U.S. talks, but the U.S. has rejected them all. Therefore, there is no such thing as China "refusing to renounce the use of force" here. In fact, it is precisely the U.S. that has already used force in the Taiwan area and refuses to renounce the use of force. The U.S. has occupied China's territory of Taiwan and turned it into a military base that threatens the security of China and Asian countries. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. However, the U.S. is attempting to blackmail the Chinese people through the Sino-U.S. talks, demanding that China give up the right to exercise sovereignty over its own territory, and even demanding that China recognize the U.S.'s right to conduct "self-defense" on Chinese territory. This arrogant imperialist attitude of the U.S. is the fundamental reason why the Sino-U.S. talks have not made progress.
    White's reckless remarks do not stop there. He even believes that the many positive suggestions put forward by the Chinese side in order to eliminate obstacles to exchanges between the people of China and the U.S. are also China's "crimes." White slandered these suggestions as being for "propaganda gains." However, everyone knows that the suggestions put forward by the Chinese side on exchanges between the people of the two countries and cultural exchanges, on the lifting of embargoes, on mutual news coverage by journalists from the two countries on the basis of equality and reciprocity, and on judicial assistance between the two countries, actually reflect the wishes of the American people. In particular, the issues of journalist interviews and judicial assistance were originally raised to the Chinese side by the relevant U.S. parties. So, I would like to ask White, can it be said that the reason why the relevant U.S. parties raised these issues was not out of their own wishes, but for China's "propaganda gains"? Of course, the facts are not like this. The fact is that the U.S. government is frantically hostile to the Chinese people for the selfish interests of a small handful of monopoly groups and is doing everything possible to oppose any opportunity for mutual exchanges between the people of China and the U.S. Because of this, in the long Sino-U.S. talks, even many relatively easy-to-solve issues raised by the Chinese side to improve Sino-U.S. relations have not achieved any results.
    Why does the U.S. government adopt this attitude of deliberately distorting the truth? Why does it, on the one hand, use all means to try to keep the Sino-U.S. talks dragging on in a moribund state, and on the other hand, have no intention of solving any practical problems in the talks at all? The U.S. is doing this in an attempt to use the Sino-U.S. talks as a guise to cover up its conspiracy to continue to occupy our territory of Taiwan and create international tension. This is of course absolutely not allowed by the Chinese government and people.
    The Chinese government and people's agreement to hold Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks is by no means a sign of weakness. The Chinese people love peace, but they are not afraid of war. The Chinese people strive to eliminate the U.S.'s use of force and threat of force in the Taiwan area by peaceful means, but they are not afraid of the U.S.'s military aggression and threat of force. The Chinese people can negotiate with the U.S. on an equal footing, but they are by no means indispensable to negotiate with the U.S. If the U.S. wants the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks to continue, it should show sincerity, and it must show sincerity. Whether the U.S. government is willing to negotiate and whether it has sincerity is now the time to give a clear answer.

### 美国政府必须作出明确的回答

    美国政府必须作出明确的回答
    由于美国方面的横加破坏，中美大使级会谈已经中断了将近七个月之久；虽然中国方面作过许多努力，要求美国政府改变态度，使会谈得以有效地进行，但是毫无结果。在这种情况下，我国政府于6月30日发表声明，要求美国政府从即日起的十五日以内派出大使级代表，恢复会谈，否则就不能不认为美国已经决心破裂中美大使级会谈，显然是十分合情合理和完全必要的。这表示了全体中国人民不能容许美国方面继续无限期中断和破坏中美大使级会谈的坚定意志。美国政府究竟有无谈判诚意，应该而且必须作出毫不含糊的明确回答。
    但是，从美国国务院新闻发布官怀特在6月30日和国务卿杜勒斯在7月1日的谈话来看，美国政府仍然采取闪烁其词、模棱两可的态度，不肯对我国政府声明中所提出的问题作出明确的回答。怀特和杜勒斯一方面表示美国在“积极考虑”选派一位新的大使；一方面却又说，美国不向所谓“最后通牒屈服”，以逃避正面回答问题。同时，他们大肆歪曲中美会谈的本来目的和会谈的实际经过情形，妄图混淆视听，以便把中美会谈长期遭到破坏和中断的责任推到中国人民的头上。
    美国政府这种打算，是决不可能得逞的。使中美大使级会谈长期陷于中断的责任，是美国政府绝对抵赖不了的。远在1955年开始的中美大使级会谈，是根据双方所达成的协议而举行的。这次中美会谈中断将近七个月之久，并且至今仍不能恢复，完全是因为美国政府任意破坏中美双方关于举行大使级会谈的协议、拒绝派遣大使级代表继续进行会谈的结果。相反的，中国方面为使会谈能够尽早恢复，曾经作了不断的努力。在今年1月14日和3月26日一再催促美国政府派遣大使级代表，恢复会谈。可是，美国政府总是拖延，一直拒不派出大使级代表，甚至不顾国际间的起码礼貌，认为连答复中国方面3月26日的去信的必要也没有。美国这种公然破坏国际协议、片面中断会谈的帝国主义态度，不仅激起了中国人民的极大愤慨，并且也引起了美国人民和世界公正舆论的不满。美国政府企图搬出它驻伦敦大使馆的一等秘书马丁来掩盖它不派大使级代表的事实，是欺骗不了任何人的。因此，中美会谈长期陷于中断的责任完全是在美国方面，这难道不是非常清楚的吗？
    现在，怀特在美国国务院的声明中提出毫无根据的“某些事实”，企图证明破坏中美会谈的似乎不是美国，而是中国，这只会是枉费心机。怀特搬起石头并没有打着别人，却正打了美国自己。
    怀特说，中国“违反”了关于平民返国的协议。这显然是颠倒黑白的胡说。自从中美双方达成关于平民回国的协议的一天起，中国方面就是认真执行这个协议的。在中国的所有美国一般平民，凡是表示希望回国的，中国政府都给予一切方便条件，让他们回国了。这是任何人都无法否认的事实。至于在中国被监禁的美国犯人，那完全是另外一个问题，因为平民和犯人是不能混为一谈的。美国人在中国犯了法，就要受中国法律的制裁，这些犯人在他们服刑期满以前当然不存在返国的问题。而且，事实上这些美国犯人现在也已经大部分被释放了。原来四十名美国犯人，现在剩下的只有四个人。因此，美国国务院想把犯人问题同平民返国问题硬扯在一起，来推卸它中断中美会谈的责任，这是根本办不到的。同样的，美国想用这种办法来掩盖它违反协议扣留中国平民的罪行，也是根本办不到的。谁都知道，由于美国政府没有履行协议中所规定的义务，成千上万的在美国的中国平民就没有机会表达他们要求回国的愿望、更不用说回国的自由。其中一部分人即使提出返国的要求，又受到美国政府的百般阻难和迫害，至今仍然不能回到自己的祖国来。这些情况，美国方面始终拒绝彻底交代。在中美会谈中，美方为了应付我方的质问，虽然曾经通知我方已允许一百零三名在美国的中国平民回国，然而就是在这一百零三名当中，至今仍有二十一人被美国扣留着。至于我方向美方提出的五十六名要求回国的中国平民，其中四十九人至今仍被美国扣留着。所有这些事实，难道还不足以证明究竟是谁违反了关于平民返国的协议吗？
    怀特又说中国方面“拒绝交代在朝鲜战争中失踪的美国军人”。这更是无中生有，无理取闹。远在中美会谈以前，关于美国战俘问题就不存在了。在中美会谈中，中国方面又就这个问题作了令人信服的答复。因此，对于怀特的污蔑，已经不值一驳。不过，如果一定要提出朝鲜战争的战俘问题，那么有发言权的不是美国方面，而是中朝方面。在朝鲜停战前后，美国方面用丧尽人性的野蛮手段扣留了中朝战俘四万八千人（其中有一万四千人是中国人）。世界上一切正直的人永远也不会忘掉美国的这个滔天罪行。中朝方面在任何时候都有权利向美国方面提出这个问题，要求清算这笔血债。
    怀特的声明还谈到台湾问题。按照怀特的说法，中国“拒绝放弃对台湾地区使用武力”，似乎是使中美会谈没有取得成果的一个原因。但是，这不过是早已破产的诡辩而已。台湾是中国的领土，中国政府同台湾地区的地方当局的关系，完全是中国的内政。中国人民有神圣权利采取任何方式行使中国在台湾的主权，任何国家都无权干涉。至于中美两国在台湾地区的争端，中国一直主张和平解决，并且在中美会谈中曾就这个问题提出了一系列建议，然而美国却一概拒绝。因此，在这里根本就不存在什么中国“拒绝放弃使用武力”的问题。事实上，在台湾地区已经使用武力，并且拒绝放弃使用武力的，恰恰是美国。美国侵占了中国领土台湾，并且把它变为威胁中国和亚洲各国安全的军事基地，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。但是，美国竟企图通过中美会谈对中国人民进行讹诈，要求中国放弃对自己的领土行使主权的权利，甚至要求中国承认美国有权在中国的领土上进行“自卫”。美国这种狂妄的帝国主义态度，就是中美会谈不能取得进展的根本原因。
    怀特的信口雌黄，还不止于此。他甚至认为中国方面为了消除中美两国人民来往的障碍而提出许多积极建议，似乎也是中国方面的“罪状”。怀特污蔑这些建议是为了“取得宣传利益”。但是，谁都知道，中国方面提出的关于两国人民来往和文化交流、关于取消禁运、关于两国记者在平等互惠的基础上相互进行新闻采访以及关于两国进行司法协助等建议，实际上也反映了美国人民的愿望。特别是记者采访和司法协助问题，本来是美国有关方面首先向中国有关方面提出来的。那么，试问怀特，难道能够说美国有关方面所以提出这些问题，不是出于本身的愿望，却是为了中国的“宣传利益”吗？事实当然不是这样。事实是：美国政府为了一小撮垄断集团的自私利益，疯狂地敌视中国人民，并竭力反对中美两国人民有任何互相往来的机会。就是因为这样，在漫长的中美会谈中，甚至连中国方面提出的关于改善中美两国关系的许多比较容易解决的问题，也没有取得任何结果。
    美国政府为什么要采取这种故意颠倒是非的态度呢？它为什么一面耍尽各种手段，企图使中美会谈要死不活地拖下去，一面又根本不打算在会谈中解决任何实际问题呢？美国这样作，无非是企图利用中美会谈作为一个幌子，来掩盖它继续霸占我国领土台湾、制造国际紧张局势的阴谋活动。这当然是中国政府和人民绝对不能容许的。
    中国政府和人民同意举行中美大使级会谈，决不是软弱的表现。中国人民热爱和平，但决不害怕战争。中国人民争取用和平方法消除美国在台湾地区使用武力侵略和武力威胁，但绝不害怕美国的武力侵略和武力威胁。中国人民可以同美国在对等的基础上进行谈判，但决不是非同美国谈判不可。美国要使中美大使级会谈能够继续下去，就应该拿出诚意来，而且必须拿出诚意来。美国政府究竟还愿不愿意谈判，究竟有没有诚意，现在是必须作出明确回答的时候了。
