(Comprehensive report by this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency reports, Asian and African newspapers continue to publish commentaries supporting the revolution of the Iraqi people and the struggle of the Lebanese people, and condemning the aggressive acts of the United States and Britain in the Middle East.

    Indonesian Newspapers Say
    People All Over the World Oppose American Provocation
    On the 17th, Jakarta newspapers continued to strongly condemn the United States' armed interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries.
    "Dongxing Bao" said that the United States' actions are not only a provocation to the people of Lebanon and the Arab countries, but also a provocation to the people all over the world who oppose colonialism and imperialism. The actions of the United States have seriously threatened world peace and blatantly violated the United Nations Charter.
    "Indonesia Torch News" said that the landing of American troops in Lebanon with the support of Britain and France is a dangerous act of playing with fire and an act of interfering in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Iraq. This is unacceptable to the peace-loving people of Indonesia and the people of the world.
    Both "Indonesia Torch News" and the English-language "Indonesia Times" pointed out that the United States' excuse for sending troops to "protect American expatriates" is unacceptable to anyone with a clear mind.
    The Indonesian "People's Daily" pointed out that the United States' aggression against Lebanon will undoubtedly arouse widespread opposition from people all over the world. "People's Daily" said that Indonesian Communist Party Deputy Secretary-General Lukman's statement on the US aggression against Lebanon will surely be warmly responded to by Indonesian workers, because this is an internationalist call, a call to support Lebanese brothers in defeating imperialism.
    Secretary-General of the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association Says
    The Iraqi Issue Should Be Resolved by the Iraqi People Themselves
    Saifuddin Zhuli, Secretary-General of the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, said that the Iraqi incident should be seen as the Iraqi people's own problem, and they are seeking the best national and political structure. He said that therefore, we should ensure that the Iraqi people solve their national problems themselves without foreign interference.
    Zhuli said that he believes that any foreign interference in other countries will backfire. He said that this lesson can be learned from the Iraqi incident and other incidents that have already occurred: whoever stands with the people in the struggle will be victorious.
    Another leader of the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, Musleh, said that he was not very surprised when he heard that the Iraqi military had launched a coup to change a kingdom into a republic. He said that because in the year 1958, the feudal structure was behind the times.
    Burmese Newspapers Support the Iraqi People's Revolution
    Calling on UN Member States Not to Succumb to US Pressure
    "Burma New Light Daily" said in an editorial on the 17th that the landing of American troops in Lebanon is obviously an act of aggression, regardless of what excuses or reasons the United States puts forward. The editorial called on members of the United Nations organization to avoid being drawn into interfering in the internal affairs of the Middle East, and at the same time not to succumb to the pressure that the United States may exert on them.
    "Road Daily" commented on the Iraqi incident in an editorial, saying that the Iraqi army and people's overthrow of the pro-Western Iraqi government was a revolutionary act that conformed to the interests of the Iraqi people. The editorial called for vigilance against the conspiracy of imperialism to interfere in Iraq's internal affairs and create tension in the Middle East.
    Mandalay's influential newspaper "People's Daily" pointed out in an editorial on the 17th that the unstable situation in the Middle East is mainly due to the penetration of imperialism into the region in economic, military, and political aspects.
    The English-language newspaper "Burmese" said that what happened in Iraq today will happen in other Middle Eastern countries that pursue policies that violate the will of the people tomorrow.
    Pakistani Newspapers Condemn American Aggression
    Demanding that the Government Revise Its Foreign Policy
    Many Pakistani newspapers have published commentaries accusing the United States of armed interference in Lebanon.
    "Karachi Times" said on the 17th that the United States' armed interference is completely unjustified, and this can only be "open imperialist aggression." The newspaper believes that the ultimate goal of the United States' armed interference in Lebanon is to seize the entire Near East region.
    "Today" pointed out that in order to achieve its imperialist interests, the United States has once again dragged the world to the brink of war. The newspaper pointed out that "the United States respects neither the United Nations Charter nor the rights of freedom and independence of Middle Eastern countries."
    The evening newspaper "Leader" said, "The conscience and public opinion of the world can never be satisfied with President Eisenhower's explanation. It cannot convince the Arabs, who have reason to believe that the West is suppressing their national movement."
    The newspaper said, "The Arab world is moving forward, and the West cannot stop it by any means."
    When talking about the Pakistani government's attitude towards the United States' armed interference in Lebanon, the newspaper said that the Pakistani government "should conduct serious consideration." It also said, "We believe that the public opinion of this country will not agree with the landing of American troops in Lebanon."
    The editorial of "Achievement News" on the 17th said: "We have to write bluntly that participating in the Baghdad Pact is of no benefit to Pakistan." Because we participated in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact, not only non-Muslim countries outside the Western camp oppose us, but even Muslim countries oppose us.
    The newspaper pointed out that therefore, we demand that the Pakistani government "revise its foreign policy."
    Karachi evening newspaper "Leader" published an editorial on the 16th, demanding that the Pakistani government not participate in or agree to any adventurous activities against Iraq in the name of the Baghdad Pact. The newspaper said, "The events that have occurred in Iraq show the power of Arab nationalism." "The Iraqi government, which was stubbornly pro-Western, was overthrown, which is certainly a blow to the Baghdad Pact and the so-called Eisenhower Doctrine. The Baghdad Pact has always been unpopular everywhere. The Arabs hate it to the core, and they know that this treaty was concluded for the interests of the West."
    Lebanese Internal Affairs Do Not Allow Foreign Interference
    Japanese Newspapers Refute American Excuses for Aggression
    Japanese newspapers have expressed unease about the United States' armed aggression against Arab countries.
    The "Asahi Shimbun" editorial on the 17th worried that the action of the US invading troops landing in Lebanon will develop into a serious international crisis, and hoped that the US military will withdraw from Lebanon as soon as possible. The newspaper pointed out that the United States' claim that "the US military landed in Lebanon to defend American interests and maintain world peace" is difficult to understand. It said that since the Lebanese civil war is an internal affair, it should be resolved by the Lebanese people themselves, and foreign countries should not interfere in its internal affairs.
    "Yomiuri Shimbun" also expressed opposition to the US military landing in Lebanon. It said that the United States' armed interference will further worsen the crisis in the Near East.
    Thai Newspapers Emphasize
    The United States Has No Reason to Interfere in Lebanon
    "Thai Pictorial News" emphasized on the 17th that the United States' shameless interference in the internal affairs of the freedom-loving people of Lebanon has no and cannot have any reason. The newspaper wrote that we firmly condemn the United States' armed interference and demand that the United Nations immediately take measures to restore justice and uphold international law.
    The newspaper said that the freedom of the people of all countries to solve their internal problems is an indivisible principle in international law. It emphasized that the US military should immediately withdraw from Lebanon.
    "Eternal News" also condemned the United States' armed interference in Lebanon. The newspaper emphasized that the US government has taken this arrogant step in order to protect the oil interests of monopoly organizations in the Near and Middle East, and the US government should be fully responsible for this.
    Sudanese National Union Party and Other Parties
    Firmly Support the Iraqi People's Revolution
    Rahman, the leader of the Sudanese People's Democratic Party, said in a statement on the 16th that the US occupation of Lebanon seriously threatens the peace of the Middle East and the world. He pointed out that the current US military intervention in Lebanon shows that after the failure of the Eisenhower Doctrine, imperialism is attempting to reoccupy the territory it lost in the Middle East.
    Rahman congratulated the Iraqi revolution in the statement. He said that this revolution represents the people's desire for freedom and sovereignty. The entire Arab nation supports and protects it.
    According to a report from Khartoum published by "Al-Ahram", the people of various cities and villages in Sudan cheered the victory of the Iraqi revolution.
    The National Union Party led by Azhari, the Southern Freedom Party led by Stan Ness, and the People's Democratic Party under the leadership of Ali Rahman all demanded that Sudanese Prime Minister Khalil immediately express recognition of the Republic of Iraq.
    All Sudanese newspapers, except those pro-ruling National Party newspapers, expressed support for the Iraqi revolution.
    According to a Middle East News Agency report from Khartoum, the Sudanese Council of Ministers issued a statement on the 16th stating that the Sudanese government is still studying the situation in the Middle East, but it hopes that peace will be achieved and that the interests of Arab countries and the will of the people will be respected.

    亚非各国舆论支持阿拉伯人民正义斗争
    强烈反对美英帝国主义在中东放火
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息，亚非各国报纸继续发表评论，支持伊拉克人民的革命和黎巴嫩人民的斗争，谴责美英两国对中东的侵略行为。
    印度尼西亚报纸说
    全世界人民反对美国挑衅
    17日雅加达各报继续严厉谴责美国武装干涉中东国家人民的内政。
    “东星报”说，美国的行动不仅是对黎巴嫩人民以及阿拉伯各国人民的挑衅，也是对全世界反对殖民主义和帝国主义的人民的挑衅。美国的行动已经严重地威胁了世界和平，并且公然破坏了联合国宪章。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”说，美国军队在英法两国支持下在黎巴嫩登陆，是危险的玩火行动，也是干涉黎巴嫩和伊拉克的内政的行动。这是爱好和平的印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民所不能容许的。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”和英文的“印度尼西亚时报”都指出，美国以“保护美国侨民”作为出兵的借口，是一切头脑清醒的人所不能接受的。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”指出，美国对黎巴嫩的侵略行动毫无疑问将会引起全世界人民广泛的反对。“人民日报”说，印度尼西亚共产党副总书记鲁克曼的关于美国对黎巴嫩的侵略的声明一定会得到印度尼西亚工人的热烈响应，因为这是国际主义的呼声，是支持黎巴嫩兄弟打败帝国主义的呼声。
    印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会总书记说
    伊拉克问题应由伊拉克人民自己解决
    印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会总书记赛福鼎·朱里说，应该把伊拉克事件看作是伊拉克人民自己的问题，他们在寻求最好的国家结构和政治结构。他说，因此，我们应该保证伊拉克人民在没有外国干涉的情况下自己解决他们的民族的问题。
    朱里说，他认为任何外国干涉其他国家都将自食恶果。他说，可以从伊拉克事件和其他已经发生的事件吸取这个教训：谁在斗争中同人民在一起，谁就将得到胜利。
    印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会的另一个领袖穆斯利赫说，他在听到伊拉克军人发动政变把一个王国改变为共和国的事情时，并不十分惊奇。他说，因为在1958年这个年头，封建的结构是落后于时代的。
    缅甸报纸支持伊拉克人民的革命
    呼吁联合国成员国不向美国压力屈服
    “缅甸新光报”17日在社论中说，美国军队登陆黎巴嫩显然是一种侵略行动，不管美国提出什么借口或理由。社论要求联合国组织的成员避免被卷入干涉中东的内政，同时不要向美国可能对他们施加的压力屈服。
    “道路日报”在社论中评论伊拉克事件时说，伊拉克军队和人民推翻伊拉克亲西方政府是一种革命行动，它是符合伊拉克人民的利益的。社论号召警惕帝国主义干涉伊拉克内政和在中东制造紧张局势的阴谋。
    曼德勒有影响的报纸“人民报”17日在社论中指出，中东的不稳定局势主要是由于帝国主义在经济、军事和政治方面对这个地区进行渗透的结果。
    英文报纸“缅甸人报”说，今天伊拉克发生的事件明天将会发生在奉行违反人民意志的政策的中东其他国家内。
    巴基斯坦报纸谴责美国侵略行为
    要求政府修改外交政策
    巴基斯坦许多报纸发表评论，指责美国对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉。
    “卡拉奇时报”17日说，美国的武装干涉是完全没有理由的，这只能是“帝国主义的公开侵略”。这家报纸认为，美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的最终目的是侵占整个近东地区。
    “今天报”指出，美国为了取得它的帝国主义的利益，再一次把世界拖上了战争的边缘。报纸指出，“美国既不尊重联合国宪章，也不尊重中东各国的自由和独立的权利”。
    晚报“领袖报”说，“世界的良知和舆论永远不能满意艾森豪威尔总统的解释。它不能说服阿拉伯人，他们有理由认为西方正在镇压他们的民族运动。”
    这家报纸说，“阿拉伯世界正在前进，不管西方用什么办法都不能阻止它。”
    这家报纸在谈到巴基斯坦政府对美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的态度时说，巴基斯坦政府“应当进行认真的考虑”。它还说，“我们相信这个国家的舆论不会同意美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆”。
    “成就报”17日的社论说：“我们不得不直截了当地写道，参加巴格达条约对巴基斯坦毫无好处”。由于我们参加了东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约，不仅西方阵营以外的非穆斯林国家反对我们，甚至穆斯林国家也反对我们。
    这家报纸指出，因此，我们要求巴基斯坦政府“修改它的外交政策”。
    卡拉奇晚报“领袖报”在16日发表社论，要求巴基斯坦政府不要参加或同意以巴格达条约的名义对伊拉克进行任何冒险活动。这家报纸说，“伊拉克所发生的事件显示了阿拉伯民族主义的威力”。“顽固地亲西方的伊拉克政府被推翻，当然是对巴格达条约和所谓艾森豪威尔主义的一个打击。巴格达条约从来都是到处不得人心的。阿拉伯人恨之入骨，而且他们知道，这个条约是为了西方的利益而缔结的。”
    黎巴嫩内政不容外国干涉
    日本报纸驳斥美国侵略借口
    日本报纸对美国武装侵略阿拉伯国家的行动表示不安。
    “朝日新闻”17日的社论担心美国侵略军在黎巴嫩登陆这一行动将发展成为严重的国际危机，并且希望美军尽快撤出黎巴嫩。这家报纸指出，美国所谓“美军登陆黎巴嫩是为了保卫美国的利益和维持世界和平”的说法是难以理解的。它说，黎巴嫩内战既然是内政问题，就应该由黎巴嫩人民自己解决，外国不应该干涉它的内政。
    “读卖新闻”也表示反对美军在黎巴嫩登陆。它说，美国的武装干涉将使近东的危机更加恶化。
    泰国报纸强调指出
    美国干涉黎巴嫩没有任何道理
    “泰国图画新闻”17日强调指出，美国无耻干涉爱好自由的黎巴嫩人民的内政是没有而且也不可能有任何理由的。这家报纸写道，我们坚决谴责美国的武装干涉，并且要求联合国立即采取措施，恢复正义和维护国际法。
    这家报纸说，各国人民解决本国内部问题的自由是国际法中不可分割的原则。它着重指出，美国军队应当立即撤出黎巴嫩。
    “永恒报”也谴责美国武装干涉黎巴嫩。这家报纸强调说，美国政府为了保护垄断组织在中近东的石油利益而采取了这种狂妄步骤，美国政府应对此负完全责任。
    苏丹民族联合党等党派
    坚决支持伊拉克人民革命
    苏丹人民民主党领袖拉赫曼在16日发表声明说，美国对黎巴嫩的侵占严重地威胁了中东和世界的和平。他指出；目前美国对黎巴嫩的军事干涉表明，帝国主义在艾森豪威尔主义失败以后，正在企图重新侵占它在中东失去的地盘。
    拉赫曼在声明中对伊拉克的革命表示祝贺。他说，这个革命代表了人民要求自由和主权的愿望。整个阿拉伯民族都支持和保护它。
    据“金字塔报”发表的来自喀土穆的消息，苏丹各个城市和村庄的人民都欢呼伊拉克革命的胜利。
    阿扎里领导的民族联合党，斯坦奈斯第斯领导的南方自由党和阿里·拉赫曼领导下的人民民主党都要求苏丹总理哈利勒立即表示承认伊拉克共和国。
    所有的苏丹报纸，除了那些亲执政的国民党的报纸以外，都表示支持伊拉克革命。
    据中东通讯社自喀土穆报道，苏丹部长会议在16日发表声明说，苏丹政府还在研究中东的局势，但是它希望和平将会实现，阿拉伯国家的利益和人民的意志将会得到尊重。
