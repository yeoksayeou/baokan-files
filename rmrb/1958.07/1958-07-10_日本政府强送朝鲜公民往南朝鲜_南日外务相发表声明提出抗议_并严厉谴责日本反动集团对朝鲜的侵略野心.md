Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 8th: Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on July 8 regarding the Japanese government's forcible deportation of Korean citizens detained at the Omura Detention Center in Japan to South Korea.

    The statement said that we have repeatedly stated our position on the issue of Korean citizens illegally detained in Japanese detention centers. However, in order to promote the "South Korea-Japan talks" engineered by American imperialists, the Japanese government has violated the will of Korean citizens and forcibly sent over a thousand Korean citizens to South Korea in four separate instances. This behavior grossly violates international law and humanitarian principles.

    Recently, Korean citizens in Japanese detention centers have been engaging in hunger strikes to protest the Japanese government's inhumane measures, oppose being forcibly sent to South Korea, and demand to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. According to foreign news agency reports, one person even committed suicide.

    The statement said that the Korean people feel great anger at this serious incident caused by the Japanese government's hostility towards the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    The statement pointed out that the Japanese government's hostile attitude towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is not only manifested in this matter. It is also blatantly revealed in the "South Korea-Japan talks" manipulated by American imperialists. Sawada Renzo, the Japanese representative who recently conducted negotiations with South Korea, made provocative remarks saying that the purpose of the "South Korea-Japan talks" is to push the 38th parallel to the Yalu River, which shows that the Japanese reactionary group has not abandoned their ambitions of aggression against the Korean people.

    The statement said that the so-called "parole" measures recently taken by the Japanese government in response to the hunger strikes of detained Korean citizens is a deceptive tactic employed by the Japanese government in the face of public opinion. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea firmly insists on immediately realizing the wishes of Korean citizens who want to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The statement demands that the Japanese government take practical measures as soon as possible to allow these people to return home and provide representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with convenient conditions to enter Japan to assist them in returning home.

    The statement pointed out that if the Japanese government does not change its unjust position and uses the issue of detained Korean citizens as a political bargaining chip in its dealings with the Syngman Rhee puppet clique, it will not only be severely condemned by the people of Korea and Japan, but also by the severe criticism of fair-minded public opinion around the world.

    If the Japanese government continues to adhere to its hostile stance towards the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, then the Japanese government will be fully responsible for all consequences arising therefrom.

    日本政府强送朝鲜公民往南朝鲜
    南日外务相发表声明提出抗议
    并严厉谴责日本反动集团对朝鲜的侵略野心
    新华社平壤8日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日7月8日就日本政府把扣留在日本大村收容所的朝鲜公民强迫送往南朝鲜一事发表声明。
    声明说，我们已经就被非法扣留在日本收容所的朝鲜公民问题多次表明了我们的态度，但是，日本政府为了促进由美帝国主义者制造的“韩日会谈”，竟违反朝鲜公民的意志，已经先后四次把一千多名朝鲜公民强迫送往南朝鲜。这种行为粗暴地违背了国际法和人道主义准则。
    最近日本收容所内的朝鲜公民以绝食斗争来反对日本政府的不人道的措施，反对日本政府把他们强迫送往南朝鲜，要求让他们回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。据外国通讯社消息，其中还有一人自杀。
    声明说，朝鲜人民，对于日本政府敌视朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府而发生的这种严重事件感到极大的愤怒。
    声明指出，日本政府敌视朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的态度不仅表现在这一件事上，还露骨地在美帝国主义者操纵举行的“韩日会谈”中，同南朝鲜进行谈判的日方代表泽田廉三最近发表挑衅性谈话说，“韩日会谈”的目的是要把三八线推到鸭绿江边，这表明了日本反动集团还没有放弃他们对朝鲜人民的侵略野心。
    声明说，最近日本政府对被扣留的朝鲜公民绝食斗争所采取的所谓“假释”措施是日本政府在社会舆论面前采取的一种欺骗手段。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府坚决主张立即实现希望返回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的朝鲜公民的愿望，声明要求日本政府尽早地采取实际措施使这些人回国，并且给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表提供进入日本的便利条件，以便协助他们回国。
    声明指出，如果日本政府不改变它的不正当的立场，利用被扣留的朝鲜公民问题作为它同李承晚傀儡集团在政治上讨价还价的资本，那么，它不仅要遭到朝日两国人民的严厉谴责，而且也将遭到全世界公正舆论的严厉的指责。
    如果日本政府继续坚持它对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的敌对立场，那么，由此而产生的一切后果将由日本政府完全负责。
