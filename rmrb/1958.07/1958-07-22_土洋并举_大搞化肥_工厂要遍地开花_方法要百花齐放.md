Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 21st: The Ministry of Chemical Industry recently held an on-site conference in Changsha on the local (土法) production of chemical fertilizers. Representatives from twenty-six provinces and autonomous regions participated.

Liang Yingyong, Vice Minister of Chemical Industry, delivered a report at the meeting, requesting all regions to adapt to the urgent needs of agricultural development. While actively constructing key projects, they should, in the next year and a half, use maximum effort to develop small-scale chemical fertilizer factories using local methods (土法), with simple equipment, suitable for mass participation. Factories should bloom everywhere, and methods should "blossom in a hundred ways."

According to reports from representatives from various regions at the meeting, in recent months, with the great leap forward in agricultural production, many regions across the country have seen the emergence of numerous local fertilizer factories. In the Changde area of Hunan Province, farmers established more than 28,000 fertilizer factories in half a month, averaging more than three per agricultural cooperative. Hubei Province successfully trial-produced more than 130 types of chemical fertilizers in the first half of this year, establishing more than 12,000 local fertilizer factories, producing more than 900,000 tons of fertilizer. In the Wanxian area of Sichuan, more than 1,200 large and small fertilizer factories were built in just three or four months. Yuhang County in Zhejiang Province established 820 fertilizer factories in one month, producing 1.82 million jin of fertilizer. At the same time, many regions have also launched mass movements for the local production of pesticides.

Representatives from various regions visited the Hunan Industrial Experiment Institute to learn about the production methods of using potash feldspar to produce potassium-calcium mixed fertilizer and fused phosphate fertilizer, and exchanged experiences from all over the country in using local methods to produce various fertilizers and pesticides. The main characteristics of these experiences are simple equipment, easy operation, low cost, and quick production, capable of sourcing materials, producing, and supplying locally, and the vast majority can be promoted in counties, townships, and cooperatives. For example, the potassium-calcium mixed fertilizer successfully trial-produced in Hunan uses potash feldspar, limestone, and gypsum, which are available everywhere in the province, as raw materials, and is made by calcination. The equipment only requires simple kilns, and each hundred jin of product only costs 1.6 to 1.9 yuan, while the fertilizer effect is equivalent to eight jin of potassium sulfate. This production method can be adopted by every township and cooperative.

Through the exchange of experiences, the representatives at the meeting further recognized the importance of promoting both indigenous and foreign methods and vigorously developing local chemical fertilizer production. Many representatives realized that the so-called "local method" is a mass method. These methods are simple in technology and produce quick results. Tests and practical application have proven that the fertilizer effect of general local fertilizers is often five to six times, or even more than ten times, higher than that of ordinary farm fertilizers. They further criticized various erroneous views that looked down on local fertilizers and pesticides, and criticized the erroneous idea of only looking at large factories and waiting for modern equipment to be available in a few years before vigorously developing production.

At the meeting, representatives from various regions also explored resources and methods for widely developing potash fertilizer.

    土洋并举  大搞化肥
    工厂要遍地开花  方法要百花齐放
    据新华社长沙21日电  化学工业部最近在长沙召开土法制化肥现场会议。参加的有二十六个省和自治区的代表。
    化工部副部长梁膺庸在会上作了报告，要求各地适应农业发展的迫切需要，在积极建设骨干项目的同时，在最近一年半的时间内，以最大的力量发展小型、设备简单、适宜于群众大量举办的土法制化肥的工厂。工厂要遍地开花，方法要“百花齐放”。
    据各地代表在会上汇报，近几个月来，随着农业生产的大跃进，全国许多地区都出现了许许多多土化肥厂。湖南常德专区农民，在半个月内就办起了两万八千多个化肥厂，平均每个农业社有三个以上。湖北省在今年上半年试制成功一百三十多种化肥，已经办起一万二千多个土化肥厂，生产出九十多万吨化肥。四川万县专区在短短的三四个月内，就建成了一千二百多个大小化肥厂。浙江余杭县在一个月内办起了八百二十个化肥厂，已经生产化肥一百八十二万斤。同时，许多地区还掀起了群众性的土法制农药运动。
    到会各地代表参观了湖南工业试验所利用钾长石生产钾钙混合肥料和融熔磷肥的生产方法，交流了全国各地用土法制各种化肥和农药的经验。这些经验的主要特点，是设备简单，操作容易，成本低，制作快，能够就地取材、就地生产和供应，绝大部分都可以在县乡以及合作社推广。如湖南试制成功的钾钙混合肥，就是利用全省到处都有的钾长石、石灰石和石膏作原料经过锻烧而成的。设备只要简单的炉窑，每一百斤产品只需成本一元六角至一元九角，而肥效相当于八斤硫酸钾。这种生产办法乡乡社社都可采用。
    通过交流经验，到会代表进一步认识了土洋并举、大搞土制化肥的重要性。许多代表认识到：所谓土法，就是群众性的办法。这些办法技术简单、收效快。经过化验和实际施用的效果证明：一般土法化肥的肥效，往往比普通农家肥料高五六倍到十多倍。他们进一步批判了各种瞧不起土制化肥和农药的错误论调；批判了那种一眼只看着大型工厂，等几年后有了现代化设备再来大搞的错误想法。
   会上，各地代表还寻找了广泛发展钾肥的资源和方法。
