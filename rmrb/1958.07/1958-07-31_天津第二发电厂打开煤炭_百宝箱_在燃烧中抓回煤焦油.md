Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 30th. The Tianjin Second Power Plant has used indigenous methods to open the first gate of coal's "treasure chest," extracting coal tar directly from the process of coal combustion for power generation.

　　The Tianjin Second Power Plant is a thermal power plant that burns 50,000 tons of coal annually. The vast amounts of organic compounds contained in the coal were previously lost as smoke, and no one had thought of a way to utilize them for a long time. After the announcement of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the plant's leaders were greatly inspired. They boldly proposed a task to all workers and technicians: to create a model in the power generation industry by extracting coal tar from coal in the cheapest way possible. After this task was put forward, people actively brainstormed and proposed solutions. Their initial proposal was to set up a separate set of coking equipment to extract the coal tar, following the model of joint ventures. The Party organization pointed out that this plan did not conform to the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and encouraged everyone to continue their research. Finally, laboratory worker Li Xuchang and young technician Su Shuangyin jointly proposed an extremely simple method: using only some bricks and scrap iron pipes, and using some of the heat from the boiler furnace, coal tar could be extracted before the coal entered the boiler for combustion. The results of the experiment using this indigenous method were very good. The first time, two kilograms of coal tar were extracted from 1,200 kilograms of coal.

　　This pioneering effort of the Tianjin Second Power Plant provides a new avenue for comprehensive utilization of coal and large-scale chemical industry development in China's thermal power plants.

　　Currently, the plant is further researching how to extract various organic chemical products from coal tar, to fully utilize coal's "treasures."

### 天津第二发电厂打开煤炭“百宝箱”  在燃烧中抓回煤焦油

    天津第二发电厂打开煤炭“百宝箱”
    在燃烧中抓回煤焦油
    新华社天津30日电　天津第二发电厂用土办法打开了煤炭“百宝箱”的第一道关口，在最近直接从煤炭燃烧发电的过程中提炼出了煤焦油。
    天津第二发电厂是一个火力发电厂，每年要烧五万吨煤。蕴藏在煤里的大量有机化合物都变成烟跑掉了，长期以来没有人想办法去利用它。党的社会主义建设总路线公布以后，给这个厂的领导人以很大启示。他们大胆地向全厂工人和技术人员提出了一个课题：要在发电行业里创造典范，把煤里所含的煤焦油以最便宜的方法提炼出来。这个课题提出以后，人们纷纷动脑筋提办法。他们提出的第一个方案是要按照搞联合企业的形式，另搞一套炼焦设备来提炼；党组织指出这个方案不符合多快好省的精神，鼓励大家继续钻研。最后，化验工人李续昌和青年技术员宿双印共同提出了一个极其简单的办法：只用一些砖头和废铁管，引用锅炉炉膛的部分热量加热，在煤进入锅炉燃烧前就提炼出煤焦油。采用这个土办法试验的结果很好，第一次就从一千二百公斤的煤炭里提炼出了两公斤煤焦油。
    天津第二发电厂的这一创举，给我国火力发电厂综合利用燃煤、大搞化学工业，提供了一个新的途径。
    现在，这个厂正在进一步研究从煤焦油里再提炼各种有机化学产品，把煤炭的“百宝”充分利用起来。
