Establishing Specialized Teams to Develop Diversified Operations
Hunan Smoothly Resolves the Labor Contradiction in Agricultural and Sideline Production Sichuan Rural Infrastructure Teams Play a Significant Role in Production

(By our correspondent, Hu Jian) The question of how to resolve the labor contradictions in agricultural and sideline production while developing diversified operations with grain production as the center in the countryside is a major issue. Practice in Hunan shows that agricultural cooperatives establish specialized production teams for diversified operations based on local conditions, which is a good way to solve labor contradictions.

Currently, Hunan Province has established more than 100,000 temporary and long-term specialized teams, with an average of two per cooperative. More than 2 million male and female laborers are now engaged in diversified production every day, accounting for more than 10% of the total daily workforce. According to preliminary information from more than 30,000 cooperatives in Xiangtan, Shaoyang, Chenxian, and Changde regions alone, due to the organization of specialized teams and the development of diversified operations, each cooperative now has an average sideline income of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, with some reaching tens of thousands of yuan. Generally, the collective sideline income of cooperatives has increased by about one-third compared to the same period last year.

Hunan is a region with many mountains, a large population, little arable land, and many opportunities for sideline occupations. Historically, farmers' sideline income has accounted for about 60% of total income, and more than 70% in mountainous areas. However, in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production this year, a general shortage of labor was felt. When developing diversified operations, various localities first encountered the problem of labor contradictions between agricultural and sideline production. Furthermore, agricultural cooperatives only had the single labor organization form of field production teams, which frequently resulted in the phenomenon of agricultural and sideline production pulling labor from each other, attending to one thing and losing sight of the other.

This spring, Party organizations at all levels in Hunan promptly summarized and promoted methods for resolving labor contradictions in agricultural and sideline production. Improving labor organization, rationally allocating labor, and establishing specialized teams to develop diversified operations were among these methods.

Specialized teams for diversified operations work under the unified leadership of the management committees of agricultural cooperatives, with division of labor and mutual cooperation. During busy farming seasons, specialized teams obey the unified allocation of the cooperative and support grain production; during slack farming seasons, when sideline production is intensive, the cooperative uniformly allocates labor, with specialized production teams as the backbone, to support specialized production. Because there are many diversified operation projects, strong technical requirements, and many jobs suitable for semi-laborers, women, and people with specialized skills, the members of specialized teams, in addition to young and middle-aged adults, also include many elderly farmers and female semi-laborers. According to statistics on specialized team members in Hengyang, Shaoyang, and other counties, female semi-laborers account for about one-quarter.

Localities have realized from practice that specialized teams have many benefits. First, with specialized teams, the contradiction of agricultural and sideline production pulling labor from each other is resolved, ensuring the overall development of grain and diversified production. At the same time, implementing division of labor is convenient for leadership and management, facilitating the full development of cooperative members' specialties, mutual exchange of experience, and the cultivation of specialized talents, which strengthens the sense of responsibility of specialized personnel. Second, with specialized teams, it is easier to reclaim wasteland on mountains, engage in mountain production, and promote the planting of economic crops on mountains, saving travel time, gradually expanding cultivated land, fully utilizing land fertility, and resolving the contradiction of grain crops competing with economic crops for land. Third, some projects that are not suitable for decentralized management are managed uniformly by specialized teams, which not only develops the collective economy but also blocks capitalist loopholes.

Now, Wugang, Shaoyang, and other counties, based on the establishment of specialized teams, have developed into establishing specialized livestock, forestry, horticulture, tea, and economic crop farms, gradually developing from scattered small plots of land to large-scale management, from comprehensive management to specialization, better combining current production with long-term production.

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Sichuan Province's standing rural basic construction team of 500,000 people has already made brilliant achievements in the past few months of the busy farming season. Farmers in various places recognize that "this is a good way to ensure that production and construction are not delayed and that immediate and long-term benefits are combined." In the northern Sichuan region, 140,000 standing basic construction team members in more than ten counties including Yilong, Yuechi, and Xichong, from mid-March to mid-May, have already transformed 200,000 mu of sloping land into terraced fields and increased the irrigated area by more than 200,000 mu through water conservancy construction.

After basic construction team members in various localities became specialized, they developed expertise, and the projects they built were of high quality and were regarded by the masses as models of more, faster, better, and more economical results. The basic construction team in Guanyin District, Yingshan County, built two hydropower stations in two days and two nights. They came up with the method of using bamboo cages to hold cobblestones to build dikes, replacing cement dikes, which saved more than 2,000 yuan in investment. The quality of the project was also very good and is now generating electricity. Winter unfinished projects and defective construction projects have also been significantly improved in quality after being continued and processed by standing basic construction team members, changing the phenomenon of "people dispersing after the busy season, resulting in wasted efforts."

The Sanba Cooperative formed a well-digging and spring-finding team consisting of forty-four young and strong cooperative members. Before the establishment of the well-digging team, cooperative members were temporarily transferred to dig wells, and the quality of the work was not high. After the establishment of the team, the personnel were fixed, each with their own responsibilities, and the quality of well-digging improved significantly.

    建立专业队发展多种经营
    湖南农副业劳力矛盾问题顺利解决  四川农村基建队在生产中作用很大
    本报讯　记者胡坚报道：在当前农村开展以粮食生产为中心的多种经营中，如何解决农副业生产中的劳力矛盾，是一个大问题。湖南各地实践证明：农业社因地制宜地建立多种经营的专业生产队，是解决劳力矛盾的一种好办法。
    目前湖南全省已建立各种临时的和长期的专业队约有十多万个，平均每社有两个。现在每天投入多种生产的男女劳动力有二百多万人，占每天出工总人数10％以上。仅据湘潭、邵阳、郴县、常德等四个专区的三万多个社了解，由于组织专业队，开展多种经营，现在平均每社已有副业收入三、四千元，多的有几万元。一般社里集体经营的副业收入，约较去年同期增加三分之一。
    湖南是山多、人多、田少，而副业门路又很多的地区。历来农民副业收入约占总收入60％，山区占70％以上。但是，在今年农业生产大跃进的高潮中，普遍感到劳动力不足。各地在开展多种经营时，首先碰到了农副业劳力矛盾问题。而农业社又只有田间生产队这种单一的劳动组织形式，因而经常发生农副业间互拉劳力、顾此失彼的现象。
    今年春天，湖南各级党的组织都及时总结和推广了解决农副业劳力矛盾的办法。改进劳动组织，合理安排劳力，建立专业队开展多种经营便是其中之一。
    多种经营专业队，是在农业社管理委员会统一领导下，分工分业互相协作地进行工作的。农忙时，专业队服从社的统一调配，支援粮食生产；在农闲时副业生产紧张，由社统一调配劳力，以专业生产队为骨干，支援专业生产。由于多种经营项目多，技术性强，许多工夫又适合半劳力、妇女和有专业特长的人去作，因此专业队的成员，除青壮年外，还有很多老农和妇女半劳力参加。仅据衡阳、邵阳等县专业队成员统计，妇女半劳力约占四分之一。
    各地从实践中体会到专业队的好处很多。首先，有了专业队，解决了农副业互拉劳力的矛盾，保证粮食和多种生产的全面发展。同时，实行分工分业，既便于领导、管理，也便于发挥社员特长，互相交流经验，有利于培养专业人材，加强了专业人员的责任心。其次，有了专业队，便于上山垦荒，坐山生产，推行经济作物上山，既节省往返途程，又能逐步扩大耕地，充分利用地力、解决粮食与经济作物争地的矛盾。再次，一些不宜分散经营的项目，集中由专业队统一经营后，既发展了集体经济，也堵塞了资本主义漏洞。
    现在，武冈、邵阳等县在搞专业队的基础上，发展到建立畜牧、林业、园艺、茶叶、经济作物等专业场，由零星小块土地，逐步发展到成片经营，由综合经营逐步发展到专业化，把眼前生产和长远生产更好地结合起来。
    据新华社讯　四川省五十万人的农村常年基本建设队伍，在以往几个月的农忙期中已经作出辉煌的成绩。各地农民公认“这是生产、建设两不误，眼前、长远相结合的好办法”。川北地区仪陇、岳池、西充等十多个县的十四万名常年基建队员，从3月中旬到5月中旬，已经把二十万亩坡地改为梯地，兴修水利增灌的面积有二十多万亩。
    各地基建队员专业化以后，有了专长，经手修建的工程质量很高，被群众当成多快好省的样板。营山县观音区的基建队两天两夜建成了两座水电站，他们想出以竹笼装鹅蛋石砌堤的办法，代替水泥堤坝等共节省了二千多元投资，工程质量也很好，现已发电。冬季未完工程和有缺点的建设项目，经过常年基建队员续修和加工后，质量也显著提高，改变了“大忙人散，功亏一篑”的现象。（附图片）
