Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 12th — Xiang Shengchang, a soldier in a machine gun company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, was recently invited to talk about philosophy at a "Five-Good" activist conference of a certain unit of the PLA Kunming area troops. Combining his own learning experience, he vividly elaborated on philosophical principles such as social forms, productive forces and production relations, base and superstructure, and spirit and matter. What seemed like extremely profound knowledge sounded pleasing and understandable when told by this ordinary soldier. This soldier's intelligence aroused great interest and surprise among all the representatives.

Xiang Shengchang is a 21-year-old Communist Party member who was born into a hired peasant family. He had never attended school before joining the army in 1955. When he first arrived in the company, he couldn't find his name on any of the dining tables. The PLA's good learning atmosphere and the leadership's guidance made him deeply realize that without culture, it would be impossible to master modern military science and technology. He was determined to conquer the cultural pillbox. In three years of diligent self-study, he achieved a considerable junior high school level in Chinese language. When he saw that the first article of the Party Constitution stipulated that Party members had the obligation to study Marxism-Leninism diligently, he resolved to delve into theory. During his studies, he asked the instructor and platoon leader questions when he didn't understand, and found simple articles to assist him. With a tenacious spirit of "not giving up until he understood," he gradually developed his ability to think from extensive reading and cultivated an interest in studying theory. In the past three years, he has taught himself more than a hundred books.

After Xiang Shengchang finished speaking about philosophy at the meeting, he said to the representatives: Marxism-Leninism is not something mysterious, everyone can learn it, and everyone should learn it, especially the working class and peasants should learn it even more. Without learning, they cannot be good masters of the country.

    普通一兵讲哲学
    新华社昆明12日电　中国人民解放军某部机枪连战士向胜昌，不久前被邀请在解放军昆明地区部队某部的“五好”积极分子大会上讲哲学。他结合自己的学习心得，生动地阐述了社会形态、生产力与生产关系、基础与上层建筑、精神与物质等哲学道理。看来仿佛十分深奥的学问，在这普通一兵道来娓娓动听。这个战士的聪明才智引起全体代表的极大兴趣和惊讶。
    向胜昌是二十一岁的共产党员，出身在一个雇农家里，1955年参军前没上过一天学。初到连队时，吃饭找不到自己名字在哪个桌上。解放军好学风气和领导上的教导，使他深深感到要掌握现代军事科学技术，没有文化是不行的。他下决心攻下文化碉堡。在三年如一日的刻苦自修中，他有了相当初中语文程度。当他看到党章规定党员义务第一条是努力学习马列主义之后，他就立志钻理论。在学习中，不懂就问指导员和排长，找浅显的文章来辅助，凭着“弄不通不罢休”的顽强钻劲，从广泛阅读中逐渐发展了自己的思考能力，培养了学习理论的兴趣，三年来，他已经自学了一百多本书。
    向胜昌在会上讲完哲学以后跟代表说：马克思列宁主义不是什么神秘的东西，人人都能学，都应该学，特别是工农群众更应该学，不学就当不好国家的主人翁。
