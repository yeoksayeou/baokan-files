Liaoning’s “Theoretical Study” Monthly Highly Popular with Readers

    (Our dispatch) The "Theoretical Study" monthly, sponsored by the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, has been well received by readers in various places after its publication on July 1st. As of the 4th, cities and counties across the province had requested subscriptions of over 120,000 copies from the Shenyang Post Office.

    On the day of its publication in Shenyang, July 1st, the inaugural issue of "Theoretical Study" sold over 32,000 copies.

    The inaugural issue of "Theoretical Study" included an article by Du Zheheng, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of Liaoning Province, titled "Consolidating and Developing the Collective Economy of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives."
