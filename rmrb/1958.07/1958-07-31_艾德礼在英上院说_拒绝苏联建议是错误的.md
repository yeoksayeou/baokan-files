Xinhua News Agency, London, July 29th. Some members of the British House of Lords advocate for a swift convening of a summit meeting to resolve the Middle East issue. Former Prime Minister and Labour Party member of the House of Lords, Clement Attlee, said in the House of Lords today that he believes holding a summit meeting in Geneva would be more desirable than holding a "too broadly based" meeting in New York. He believes that the United States and Britain were wrong to reject the Soviet proposal to hold a summit meeting in Geneva.

He also said: He does not know "to what extent it must be emphasized that this meeting is a Security Council meeting." He pointed out the fact that the Chiang Kai-shek clique still occupies China's seat in the Security Council, believing that this will create difficulties.

Attlee criticized the United States, saying: "There are many lawyers in the U.S. State Department, but I don't think they have performed very well in handling diplomatic affairs."

Lord Salwyn-Clarke urged the British government to persuade its allies to hold a summit meeting as soon as possible. He believes that the consequences of military intervention in the Middle East by the United States and Britain "may jeopardize our oil supply, rather than make it more secure." He said: The United States and Britain are supporting those "governments that are unpopular in their own countries," and this action "is questionable legally, and even more questionable in terms of wisdom. This action is highly unnecessary and dangerous."

At the House of Lords meeting on the 28th, the former Lord President of the Council, the Marquess of Salisbury, who had actively supported the Anglo-French armed invasion of Egypt, also advocated holding a high-level meeting, believing that it was the "only possible way out" of the current situation.

Sir Alexander said, "Hold a high-level meeting as soon as possible. Ordinary people around the world are anxiously and resolutely waiting for us to bring them peace, not war."

    艾德礼在英上院说
    拒绝苏联建议是错误的
    新华社伦敦29日电　英国上院一些议员主张迅速召开最高级会议，解决中东问题。前首相、工党上院议员艾德礼今天在上院中说，他认为在日内瓦举行一次最高级会议比在纽约举行一次“基础过分广泛”的会议要更加可取。他认为，美国同英国拒绝苏联提出的在日内瓦举行最高级会议的建议是错误的。
    他还说：他不知道，“必须在多大程度上强调这次会议是安全理事会会议”，他指出了在安全理事会中蒋介石分子还占据着中国代表的席位的事实，认为这将造成困难。
    艾德礼批评美国说：“美国国务院中的律师很多，但是我并不认为他们在处理外交事务方面表现得很出色。”
    上院议员薛尔金勋爵要求英国政府说服自己的盟国尽早举行最高级会议。他认为，美国和英国对中东进行军事干涉的后果，“可能是危害我们的石油供应，而不是使石油供应更有保证”。他说：英美正在支持那些“在本国不得人心的政府”，这种行动“从法律上来讲是成问题的，从智慧上来讲甚至更加成问题。这种行动是十分不必要的，而且是危险的。”
    在28日的上院会议上，前枢密院长、曾经积极支持英法武装侵略埃及的索耳兹伯里侯爵也主张召开高级会议，他认为这是解决当前局势的“唯一可能的出路”。
    亚历山大爵士说，“尽可能快地召开高级会议吧。全世界的普通人民都忧虑而坚决地等待着我们给他们带来和平，而不是战争。”
