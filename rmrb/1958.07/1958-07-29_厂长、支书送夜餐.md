	Factory Director and Party Secretary Deliver Late-Night Meal

	At midnight, dark clouds gathered. Yuan Jiarong, a female welder in the nickel mine's electric welding workshop, was still focused on welding "flow pipes." Although she hadn't slept for three days and nights, she showed no signs of fatigue. Recently, she had created the "high-current short-arc welding method," which increased the welding speed of "flow pipes" from two per hour to ten in one fell swoop. Therefore, she was determined to complete the welding of one hundred and twenty "flow pipes" before dawn. Factory Director Zhou and Party Secretary Yang repeatedly tried to persuade her to go back to rest, but she consistently refused. She knew that if the "flow pipes" were not supplied in time, the concrete pouring project for the vertical shaft would be interrupted, which would prolong the construction time of the nickel mine.

	After Factory Director Zhou and Party Secretary Yang returned to their dormitory, they remained worried. They thought that Yuan Jiarong was a woman who had not slept for several days and nights. Due to excessive fatigue, even a slight lack of concentration could lead to an accident. The two discussed making a late-night meal for Yuan Jiarong and taking it to her, so she could eat and rest at the same time, and have more energy after eating. So they asked the cook to make a bowl of noodles. Party Secretary Yang carried the noodles, and Factory Director Zhou carried a thermos of hot water. They came to the workshop again and asked Yuan Jiarong to eat before continuing to work. Yuan Jiarong was deeply moved to see how much the leaders cared for her. She said to the two leaders, "I will definitely complete one hundred and twenty 'flow pipes' before dawn to ensure that the needs are met." Factory Director Zhou and Party Secretary Yang watched her finish the noodles before returning to rest. Under the care and encouragement of the leaders, Yuan Jiarong not only welded one hundred and twenty "flow pipes" by seven o'clock in the morning, but also welded four large funnels.

    新关系新作风
    厂长、支书送夜餐
    半夜，乌云密布，镍矿电焊车间的女电焊工袁嘉荣还在全神贯注地焊接“流筒”，虽然她已经三天三夜没睡觉了，可是没有一点倦容。最近，她创造了“大电流短弧焊接法”，使焊接
  “流筒”的速度由原来的每小时两个一跃而提高到十个。因此，她决心要在天亮以前完成一百二十个“流筒”的焊接任务。周厂长和杨支书一再来劝她回去休息，她始终不肯回去。因为她知道：“流筒”供应不上，竖井的混凝土浇筑工程就要中断，就会延长镍矿的建设时间。
    周厂长和杨支书回到宿舍后，一直放心不下，想到袁嘉荣是个女同志，几昼夜没睡觉了，因为过度的疲劳，精神稍有不集中，就会发生事故。两个人商量好，给袁嘉荣做一顿夜餐送去，叫她一边吃，一边休息，吃完了干活会更有劲。于是叫炊事员做了一碗挂面，杨支书端着挂面，周厂长提着热水瓶又来到车间，叫袁嘉荣吃完了再干。袁嘉荣一看领导同志这样关心她，心中很感动，对两位领导同志说：“在天亮之前，一定完成一百二十个‘流筒’，保证满足需要。”周厂长和杨支书看着她吃完了面才回去休息。袁嘉荣在领导同志的关怀和鼓励下，到早上七点钟，不仅焊成一百二十个“流筒”，还焊了四个大漏斗。
