　　Following the Path of the "Seagull" Exercise Team

　　In the countryside, no work can be separated from production. Whoever grasps this principle is on the right path and will more easily achieve their goals. Otherwise, the opposite will occur.

　　The "Seagull" Exercise Team of the Bei Peizhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, initially took the opposite path, which everyone opposed. The Party branch discovered this situation and helped them change. People immediately changed their views of them, saying, "The women in our village are not simple."

　　All cultural and sports activities, when combined with production, are also combined with the masses, and can gain the support of the masses and be carried out enthusiastically.

　　Now, a high tide of cultural and sports activities has been set off in many rural areas across the country, and many advanced counties in cultural and sports activities have emerged. The "Seagull" Exercise Team has given us another extremely important enlightenment: to persevere in sports activities for a long time, and to truly achieve "everyone on the playground, exercising every day," it must be flexible and diverse, and suitable for the needs of production.

    走“海鸥”锻炼队的路
    在农村里，任何工作都不能脱离生产。谁摸到了这个规律，谁就走对了路，比较容易达到目的。否则，适得其反。
    山西万荣县北裴庄农业社“海鸥”锻炼队，开初走了相反的一条路，大家反对。党支部发现这个情况，帮助她们转变过来。人们马上改变了对她们的看法，说“咱村妇女不简单”。
    一切文化体育活动，同生产结合也就是同群众结合，就能取得群众的支持，就能热火朝天地开展起来。
    现在全国很多农村都掀起了文化体育活动的高潮，出现了很多文化体育活动的先进县。“海鸥”锻炼队又给我们一个极重要的启示：要把体育活动长久坚持下去，真正做到“人人上操场、天天有锻炼”，那就必须灵活多样，适合生产的需要。
