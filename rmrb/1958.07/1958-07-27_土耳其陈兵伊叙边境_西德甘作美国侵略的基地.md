Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 25th: All newspapers here are citing Turkish newspaper reports that several Turkish troops stationed in Iskenderun were transferred to the Turkish-Syrian border on the 24th.

At the same time, large numbers of American jet aircraft flew from the Adana base in southern Turkey to Beirut.

Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: TASS, Moscow: The Soviet government today, in a note delivered to the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in Moscow, called on the West German government to take effective measures to ensure that West German territory is not used for aggression against Arab countries that are safeguarding their freedom and independence.

The note pointed out that it has been learned in recent days that West German territory is being used by the U.S. military command as a base for armed intervention in Arab countries. U.S. aircraft are transferring paratrooper units from West German territory to the aggressive regions of the Near East. At the same time, it can be seen from the statement made by Eckardt, Director of the Federal Press Office, on July 18th, that the West German government approves of and defends this action by the U.S. military command.

The note stated that the federal government, as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, not only supports its partners in this bloc (who are attempting to impose regimes on the Arab people that they do not like by force), but has in fact embarked on a path of condoning dangerous adventures that seriously threaten peace.

It must be pointed out that the above-mentioned actions of the federal government contradict its previous claims that the American troops stationed in West Germany serve defensive purposes and will never become instruments of aggression.

The Soviet note emphasized that placing the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany at the disposal of foreign troops has nothing in common with maintaining peace or ensuring the security of the Federal Republic. The note said that the West German government cannot evade its responsibility for its complicity in aggression in the Near East.

### 土耳其陈兵伊叙边境　西德甘作美国侵略的基地

    土耳其陈兵伊叙边境　西德甘作美国侵略的基地
    新华社大马士革25日电　这里所有的报纸都援引土耳其报纸的消息说，驻在依斯坎德伦的几支土耳其部队已经在24日调往土耳其—叙利亚边境。
    同时，有大批美国喷气式飞机从土耳其南部的亚达那基地飞往贝鲁特。
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府今天在交给德意志联邦共和国驻莫斯科大使馆的一份照会中，呼吁西德政府采取有效措施，以便使西德领土不致被用来对维护本国自由和独立的阿拉伯国家进行侵略。
    照会指出，近几天来获悉，西德领土被美军司令部用作对阿拉伯国家实行武装干涉的一个基地。美国飞机从西德领土把伞兵部队调到近东的侵略地区。同时，从联邦新闻局局长埃卡特7月18日的谈话中可以看出，西德政府赞同美军司令部的这种行动，并且为这种行动辩解。
    照会说，参加北大西洋公约组织的联邦政府不仅支持了它的这个集团的伙伴（他们企图用武力把阿拉伯人民所不喜欢的政权强加于阿拉伯人民），而且事实上已经走上助长严重威胁和平的冒险的道路。
    不能不指出，联邦政府的上述行动是同它以前所谓驻扎在西德的美国军队是为防御目的服务、决不会成为侵略工具这一说法相矛盾的。
    苏联照会着重指出，把德意志联邦共和国领土交给外国军队支配，这同维护和平、同保证联邦共和国的安全毫无共同之处。照会说，西德政府不能不对侵略中近东的帮凶行为负责。
