Xinhua News Agency, 30th – The National Putonghua Teaching Achievement Observation Meeting, which opened on the 25th, concluded on the afternoon of the 30th after holding an excellent program performance and awards ceremony. Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang, Hebei and other provinces and cities all received the conference's award flag because of their good work in Putonghua teaching. Wushan Township in Datian County, Fujian Province, which has made outstanding achievements in promoting Putonghua nationwide, also received an award flag. Schools with significant achievements in promoting Putonghua, such as Shunxing Road Primary School in Qingdao, Shandong Province, Huanglu Normal School in Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, No. 1 Central Primary School in Luwan District, Shanghai, No. 28 Middle School in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, and Baoding Normal School in Hebei Province, received certificates of merit from the conference. In addition, the conference also awarded first, second, and third prizes and general awards to the representatives participating in the conference, categorized by primary school students, middle school (normal school) students, primary school teachers, and middle school (normal school) teachers.

From the 25th to the 29th, the conference held four and a half days of observation performances and work experience introductions. One hundred and thirty-eight representatives from twenty-five provinces, cities, and autonomous regions performed nearly one hundred and forty programs. The twenty excellent programs performed at the awards ceremony on the 30th were selected from these hundred-plus programs. Many representatives, when performing Putonghua programs, also spoke a short passage in their local dialect, which most people could not understand, thus better illustrating the important significance of promoting Putonghua for strengthening the mutual relations of the people of the whole country. Some programs were even performed together by representatives of several ethnic groups. Here, Putonghua has become a powerful tool for promoting national unity.

At the conference on the 30th, Vice Minister of Education Wei Que reported on the results of the observation meeting's evaluation. He said that the situation at this observation meeting was very exciting. The teachers and students participating in the meeting from all over the country spoke fluent Putonghua, and the lowest score for all program evaluations was above 80 points. And these teachers and students have only been learning Putonghua for a year or two, or even just a few months. This powerfully proves that under the call and leadership of the Party Central Committee, with the attention and support of local party committees, and with the promotion of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the great leap forward in culture, we will be able to quickly promote Putonghua in schools throughout the country. He represented the Ministry of Education in calling on the teachers and students participating in the observation meeting to work harder to be promoters and activists in promoting Putonghua after returning, and to universally promote Putonghua not only in schools but also in government offices, enterprises, and society, in order to further promote the unification of the Chinese language.

Shu Sheyu, Deputy Director of the Central Putonghua Promotion Work Committee, spoke at the conference on the 30th. He said that this observation meeting was very gratifying. Listening to the performances of the representatives from all over the country, I really couldn't tell who was from Guangdong and who was from Fujian. He hoped that the representatives would not only learn well themselves, but also play a greater role in promoting Putonghua.

Wu Yuzhang, Deputy Director of the Central Putonghua Promotion Work Committee and Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, presided over the awards ceremony, distributing the prizes to the representatives from all over the country one by one. In his speech, he also encouraged everyone not to be arrogant or rash after returning, but to make persistent efforts, and to pull out white flags and plant red flags everywhere in the work of promoting Putonghua, so that the work of promoting Putonghua will have new and greater development.

    做推广普通话的促进派
    全国普通话教学成绩观摩会结束
    新华社30日讯　25日开幕的全国普通话教学成绩观摩会，已在30日下午举行优秀节目表演和发奖大会后结束。江苏、山东、上海、浙江、广东、陕西、黑龙江、河北等省市都因为普通话教学工作作得较好获得了大会的奖旗。获得奖旗的还有全国推广普通话有卓越成就的福建省大田县吴山乡。推广普通话有显著成绩的学校山东省青岛市顺兴路小学、安徽省巢县黄麓师范、上海市卢湾区第一中心小学、黑龙江省哈尔滨市第二十八中学、河北省保定师范等获得了大会的奖状。另外，大会还按小学生、中学（师范）生、小学教师、中学（师范）教师分别发给了参加大会的代表以一、二、三等奖和普通奖。
    从25日到29日，大会进行了四天半的观摩表演和工作经验介绍。来自二十五个省市自治区的一百三十八名代表，表演了将近一百四十个节目。30日发奖大会上表演的二十个优秀节目就是从这一百多个节目中挑选出来的。许多代表在表演普通话节目时都对照地说了一小段大家听不懂的他们家乡的方言，这就更好地说明了推广普通话对于密切全国人民相互关系的重要意义。有的节目还是由几个民族的代表一起表演的。在这里普通话成了一种促进民族团结的有力工具。
    在30日的大会上，教育部副部长韦悫报告了观摩会评比的结果。他说，这次观摩会的情况使人感到非常兴奋，来自各地的参加会的教师和学生都讲得一口漂亮的普通话，所有节目评比的最低分数都在八十分以上。而这些教师和学生学习普通话都还不过是一两年甚至是最近几个月的事。这就有力地证明了，在党中央的号召和领导下和各地党委的重视支持下，在工农业生产大跃进和文化大跃进的推动下，我们是能够很快地在全国的学校里推广普通话的。他代表教育部号召参加观摩会的教师和学生回去以后要更努力地做推广普通话的促进派和积极分子，不仅在学校而且要在机关、企业和社会上普遍推广普通话，以进一步促进汉语的统一。
    中央推广普通话工作委员会副主任舒舍予在30日的大会上讲话。他说，这次观摩会使人非常高兴。听各地代表们的表演，我实在听不出谁是广东来的，谁是福建来的。他希望代表们不仅要自己学得好，而且要在推广普通话的工作中起更大的作用。
    中央推广普通话工作委员会副主任、中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章主持大会发奖仪式，把奖品一一发给各地代表，他还在讲话中勉励大家回去后，不骄不躁，再接再厉，在推广普通话工作中到处拔白旗，插红旗，使推广普通话工作有新的更大的发展。
