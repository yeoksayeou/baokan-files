    The Ever-Changing Shanghai First Medical College
    Near the quiet Fenglin Bridge in the southwest of Shanghai, there is a large group of buildings, which is the Shanghai First Medical College with a history of thirty-one years. Shanghai First Medical College currently has 3,238 students (including 47 graduate students). In the nine years after liberation, a total of 2,254 students graduated, more than four times the total number of graduates in the twenty-two years before liberation. After liberation, it also trained 1,374 advanced trainees in various departments for hospitals across the country.
    At present, the college has four departments: the Department of Medicine, the Department of Hygiene (both six-year programs), the Department of Pharmacy (five-year program), and the Department of Industrial and Agricultural Hygiene (three-year professional program). This college has a total of 54 teaching and research groups and six affiliated hospitals: the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhongshan Hospital (both are general hospitals), Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Children's Hospital, Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat Hospital, and Tumor Hospital (the above are specialized hospitals), with a total of more than 2,000 beds. These serve as places for teaching, research, and practical medical work for all teachers and students of the college. In addition, this college also has an affiliated nursing school and an industrial and agricultural preparatory school. For the needs of work development, a thoracic hospital and an infectious disease hospital are also under construction.
    In recent years, after ideological transformation, departmental adjustments, and teaching reforms, the college has undergone fundamental changes. Especially in the past year or so, after the blooming and contending, rectification, and the "double-anti" movement, teachers, students, and staff of the college wrote about 100,000 big-character posters, and on the basis of criticizing the erroneous thinking of "Greater Shanghai Medical College," eliminated conservative and backward ideas, and clearly established the class line of colleges and universities to train a large number of worker-peasant students. Now, a brand-new situation has emerged in all aspects of the college's work. Teachers in the Department of Hygiene have begun to step out of the classroom, gradually combining teaching with hygiene, disease prevention, and health care. The affiliated hospitals have broken with conventions, implemented a 24-hour day and night outpatient service, and established more than 200 simple beds. All hospitals maintain the fine tradition of conducting scientific research and training advanced teachers and doctors responsibly, and many research projects have reached international standards. At present, basic science and clinical medicine are training a large number of advanced teachers and physicians for all parts of the country.
    In 1956, Shanghai First Medical College was also responsible for preparing for the establishment of Chongqing Medical College and its affiliated hospital in Chongqing, and transferred senior physicians to support the newly established Xinjiang Medical College. Recently, this medical college has also established a rural simple hospital in Jiading County, Shanghai. (Wang Zhu)

    上海第一医学院气象日新
    在上海市西南幽静的枫林桥附近，有一个很大的建筑群，这就是已有三十一年历史的上海第一医学院。上海第一医学院现有在校学生三千二百三十八人（包括研究生四十七人）。解放后九年毕业学生共二千二百五十四人，超过解放前二十二年毕业生总和的四倍。解放后还为全国各地医院培养了各科进修员一千三百七十四人。
    目前全院设有四个系：医疗系、卫生系（都是六年制）、药学系（五年制）、工农卫生系（专业部三年制）。这个学院共有五十四个教研组和六个附属医院：附属第一医院、中山医院（以上是综合性医院）、妇产科医院、儿科医院、眼耳鼻喉科医院、肿瘤医院（以上是专科医院），共有两千多张病床，这是供全院师生教学、研究和进行实际医疗工作的场所。另外，这个学院还附设护士学校、工农预科学校各一所。为了工作发展需要，最近还正在兴建胸腔医院和传染病医院。
    几年来这个医学院经过思想改造、院系调整、教学改革，全院的面貌起了根本的变化。特别是最近一年多来，经过鸣放、整改、双反运动，全院师生员工写了约十万张大字报，在批判了“大上医”的错误思想的基础上，扫除了保守和落后思想，明确树立了高等学校大量培养工农学生的阶级路线。现在，这个医学院的各方面工作更出现了全新的局面。卫生系教师开始走出大门，使教学工作和卫生防疫保健事业逐步结合起来。各附属医院打破陈规，实行日夜二十四小时门诊制，建立简易病床二百多张。各院都保持着认真负责进行科学研究和培养进修教师、医师工作的优良传统，有不少研究项目已经达到国际水平。目前，基础科学和临床医学正为全国各地培养大批进修师资和医师。
    1956年，上海第一医学院还负责在重庆市筹建一所重庆医学院及其附属医院，并且调出高级医师支援新建新疆医学院。最近，这个医学院又在上海市的嘉定县建立了一所乡村简易医院。  （王朱）
