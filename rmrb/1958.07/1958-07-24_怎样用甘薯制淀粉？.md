How to Make Starch from Sweet Potatoes?

Sweet potatoes contain a lot of starch (about 30%), which is the raw material for making vermicelli, glass noodles, jelly, starch sheets, maltose, and blood sausage fillings. It is also an industrial product for sizing yarn, extracting glucose for medicine, etc. The by-products (slurry, residue) can also be used for raising pigs. Processing sweet potatoes into starch not only solves storage difficulties but also meets the needs of various aspects. Therefore, I would like to introduce to you the method of extracting starch.

The equipment and operation process for making starch from sweet potatoes are very simple:

I. Washing: Wash off the dirt and debris attached to the sweet potatoes.

II. Crushing: Pour the washed sweet potatoes into the wooden box attached to the drawing machine and crush them.

III. Grinding: Put the crushed sweet potatoes into the grinder and grind them into starch milk.

IV. Sedimentation: There are two methods: ① When using a sedimentation tank to refine starch, first fill the tank with starch milk and let it stand overnight. After the starch has completely settled, drain the clear water from the top and take out the sediment (crude starch). Then repeatedly wash and refine it to obtain refined starch. ② When using a flume for sedimentation, a suitably thin and long flume can be set up, making it have a steady incline of one-seventieth to one-ninetieth. Steadily pour the starch milk from above the flume, then large starch particles will settle first, and small starch particles will flow downwards to settle, with impurities and water flowing out of the flume together. Shovel out the wet starch in the tank and place it on a cloth with the four corners gathered up (generally each cloth bag can hold more than fifty catties of wet material). Hang and filter for three to six hours, until the starch is dry and solid, with no water on the surface, but still very moist when pinched by hand (water content is about 50%), then it can be dried.

V. Drying: After taking out the starch from the cloth bag, divide it into small pieces and place them in a pan to dry in the sun. If it is difficult to dry due to weather changes, the starch pieces can be put into a wooden bucket or earthenware jar and add water to submerge the starch by about one inch. Wait for the weather to improve before drying again.

(Note: If the starch is not immediately dried in the sun after hanging to dry, it is easy to change color and affect the quality)

    怎样用甘薯制淀粉？
    甘薯所含淀粉很多（约30％左右），是制造粉条、粉丝、凉粉、粉皮，饴糖、打卤灌肠的原料，也是浆纱、提炼葡萄糖制药等工业用品，副产品（浆水、渣）还可以养猪。甘薯加工成淀粉，不但可以解决保管的困难，同时又可满足各方面的需要。所以，我愿在这里向大家介绍制取淀粉的办法。
    甘薯作淀粉的设备和操作过程非常简便：
    一、洗涤：将甘薯上面粘附的泥土及杂物洗净。
    二、轧碎：洗净的甘薯，倒入拉丝机上附设之木箱内轧碎。
    三、磨粉：将轧碎的甘薯放入磨口，磨成淀粉乳。
    四、沉淀：有两种办法：①用沉淀槽精制淀粉时，先将淀粉乳盛满槽内静置一夜，等淀粉完全沉降后，排去上部的清水，取出沉淀物
  （粗淀粉），再反复水洗精制，即得精制淀粉。②用笕沟沉淀时，可设适当的细长笕沟，使它呈七十分之一—九十分之一之静稳倾斜。自笕沟上方稳静地倾入淀粉乳，则大粒淀粉先行沉淀，小粒淀粉流向下方沉淀，夹杂物与水共同自笕沟流出。将池内的湿淀粉铲出，放在一块四角兜起的布上（一般每个布包可盛五十多斤湿料），挂滤三—六小时，俟淀粉干固，表面没有水，但用手捏还很潮湿（含水量在50％左右），即可进行干燥。
    五、晒粉：从布包中取出淀粉后，即分成小块放在盘内让太阳晒干。如因天气变化不易晾晒时，可将淀粉块放入木桶或陶缸内加水，使浸没淀粉一寸左右，俟天气好转时再晒。
      （注：淀粉吊干后如不即用阳光晒，容易变色，影响质量）
