Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: Amman dispatch: According to the overall plan of the United States and Britain to invade the Middle East, British troops began to invade Jordan this morning.

According to Western news agencies, the first batch of British invasion troops was airlifted from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus to Amman, the capital of Jordan, at 8:30 am local time in Jordan. Subsequently, British transport planes flew to Amman airport every hour, unloading British soldiers and large quantities of weapons, ammunition, and gasoline. The airlift had not stopped by noon. According to yesterday's disclosure by London's "Daily Mail," a total of three battalions and a paratrooper brigade of British invasion troops will be transported from Cyprus.

The U.S. and British imperialist stooge, King Hussein of Jordan, officially acknowledged the arrival of "friendly forces" on the radio this morning.

The intrusion of British intervention troops into Jordan is considered part of the overall US-British invasion plan to expand their military aggression against the Republic of Iraq and other Arab national independent countries.

In order to realize this conspiracy, Britain has already assembled troops around Iraq. In Bahrain Island, southeast of Iraq, Britain has reinforced a battalion. In Aden, Britain has reinforced an infantry brigade and a battalion. In addition, the British fleet, led by the aircraft carrier "Bulwark," including three fast ships and several submarines, is heading to Aden. British troops have also been airlifted to Adana in southern Turkey, attempting to invade Iraq from the north.

In order to create an excuse for intervening in Iraq, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd yesterday wantonly slandered the Iraqi revolution in the British House of Commons as an "indirect aggression" against Britain, and insisted that there was a "conspiracy against Jordan" in Iraq.

    英军侵入约旦
    新华社17日讯　安曼消息：按照美英两国侵略中东的总计划，英国军队在今天早晨开始侵入约旦。
    据西方通讯社报道，第一批英国侵略军是在约旦当地时间八时半从地中海的塞浦路斯岛空运到约旦首都安曼的。随后每隔一小时，就有英国运输机飞到安曼机场，卸下英国士兵和大批武器、弹药和汽油。空运到过午以后还没有停止。据伦敦“每日简报”昨天透露，从塞浦路斯共运去的英国侵略军将有三个营和一个伞兵大队。
    美英帝国主义的走狗约旦国王侯赛因今天早晨在电台上正式承认“友邦军队”的到达。
    英国干涉军的侵入约旦，被认为是美英总的侵略计划的一部分，以便扩大它们对伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯民族独立国家的军事侵略。
    为了实现这一阴谋，英国已经在伊拉克周围集结军队。在伊拉克东南的巴林岛，英国增援了一个营。在亚丁，英国又增援了一个步兵旅和一个营。另外以航空母舰“堡垒号”为首的包括三艘快速舰和几艘潜水艇的英国舰队正在驶往亚丁。英国军队也已经空运到土耳其南部的阿达那，企图从北面进犯伊拉克。
    为了给干涉伊拉克制造借口，英国外交大臣劳埃德昨天在英国下院大肆诬蔑伊拉克革命是对英国的“间接侵略”，并硬说在伊拉克有什么“反对约旦的阴谋”。
