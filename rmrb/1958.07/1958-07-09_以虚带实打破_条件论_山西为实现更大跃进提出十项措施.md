Using the "Abstract" to Drive the "Concrete" to Break the "Condition Theory"
Shanxi Proposes Ten Measures to Achieve a Greater Leap Forward

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 8th dispatch) The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a provincial rural work conference to study and discuss the new situation of the agricultural Great Leap Forward, and put forward new tasks for current and next year's agricultural production. It was determined that after the unprecedented bumper harvest of wheat in the province, efforts should be made to achieve a bumper harvest in the autumn, and, with the spirit of "looking at this year for next year," preparations should be made in advance to strive for a greater harvest next year.

The meeting studied and analyzed the new situation of leap forward upon leap forward since last winter, further criticized various conservative ideas, and launched a major debate on various conservative ideas such as "the foundation is too poor, the conditions are not good, and changing the foundation and conditions can only be gradual and not leap forward," "the plains can leap forward, but the mountainous areas cannot," and adopting a skeptical and cold attitude towards advanced experience, advanced indicators, and new things and new records created by various places. Through specific accounting and comparison of similar regions, the "condition theory" was broken. The conference exchanged advanced experiences from various places in actively leading the masses to leap forward and overcome difficulties. The meeting also summarized the experience of the province's wheat in achieving a bumper harvest under extremely unfavorable conditions in the spirit of seeking the "abstract" from the "concrete," making everyone clearly aware that under any conditions, as long as the role of people is brought into play, conditions can be transformed, low-yield areas can be turned into high-yield areas, and low-yield crops can be transformed into high-yield crops. After the meeting unfolded ideological criticism through discussing the "abstract" and the "concrete," many cadres clarified and enriched their ideas and methods for leading the agricultural Great Leap Forward in theory and practice.

On the basis of great ideological liberation, the meeting re-examined the leap forward indicators for this year's agricultural production based on the unprecedented bumper harvest of wheat, the good growth of current autumn crops, and the leap forward situation in various aspects. The new indicators encouraged the participants, who discussed and studied while sending telegrams, making phone calls, writing letters, and sending people back to convey the spirit of the meeting, deploying work in a timely manner, with the upper level holding meetings and the lower level taking action, setting off a competition inside and outside the meeting. Many cadres proposed to learn from Henan, catch up with Hubei, and strive to release "satellites" of high-yield harvests of various crops in the autumn.

The meeting believes that 1959 will be a year of greater leap forward. According to the spirit of "looking at this year for next year," preparations must be made early this year, and the third quarter of this year should be regarded as the first quarter of next year. Based on this spirit, the leap forward indicators for next year were determined.

In order to achieve a bumper harvest this autumn and a greater leap forward next year, it is necessary to seize the management of autumn fields and actively prepare for a greater leap forward next year. The meeting studied ten major measures: 1. The three major tasks of water conservancy, soil and water conservation, and afforestation to transform nature must be basically realized throughout the province this year in advance. 2. Carry out a soil revolution, requiring deep plowing of one chi two to one chi five in flat areas, and deep plowing of about one chi in mountainous areas. All 20 million mu of wheat fields will be deeply plowed this year, and another 20 million mu of autumn fields will be deeply plowed before next spring plowing, and all cultivated land will be deeply plowed once by the end of next year. 3. Solve the fertilizer problem. First of all, we must pay attention to farm manure. The base fertilizer for wheat should be more than 30,000 jin, and various crops should be fertilized more than 40,000 jin. In addition, we must rely on industry to gradually achieve that every county has a local chemical fertilizer factory. We must advocate the mass production of local chemical fertilizers, requiring an average application of 40 to 50 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu. 4. Carefully select superior seeds to ensure sufficient quantity and variety. 5. Vigorously promote close planting, increase the amount of sowing, and transform all wide-row drills into close-planting drills, leaving no old drills. 6. Vigorously fight against insect pests. Next year, we must achieve a basically insect-free province, and vigorously adopt local methods to manufacture insecticidal pesticides. 7. Develop large-scale high-yield areas. 8. Grasp the two ends and bring along the middle, regularly inspect and rank all crops, and summarize advanced experiences. 9. Further carry out tool reform and combine it with the "four modernizations" of mechanization, chemistry, electrification, and transportation mechanization. 10. Combine the agricultural Great Leap Forward with the cultural revolution. The meeting believes that the main task in the four months from now to the autumn harvest is to focus on field management, take phased management as the guiding principle, implement agricultural technical measures, apply topdressing fertilizer, irrigate, cultivate, and weed in a timely manner, and prevent natural disasters at all times, first of all drought prevention. All measures should start from this, and even if it does not rain from now until the harvest, we must ensure the completion of the leap forward task.

The meeting also discussed the leadership of rural work according to the needs of adapting to the new situation and new tasks. Everyone believes that we should use the principle and method of combining the "abstract" and the "concrete," using the "abstract" to drive the "concrete," and seeking the "abstract" from the "concrete" to study the laws of the Great Leap Forward to guide the Great Leap Forward. Rural work should focus on developing productive forces and achieve three combinations: the combination of all agricultural departments; the combination of agricultural and industrial departments; and the combination of agricultural and cultural and educational departments. All work should be led by politics, and everyone should do political work. Political work should also be combined in three ways: combined with handling contradictions among the people; combined with liberating thought and transforming nature; and combined with socialist realistic education and communist future education. Faced with such huge tasks, labor force is a very important issue. The meeting studied the strengthening of the organization and management of the labor force, and proposed to carry forward the spirit of great collaboration between regions, between mountainous areas and plains, and between agriculture and industry to complete the task of the Great Leap Forward.

    以虚带实打破“条件论”
    山西为实现更大跃进提出十项措施
    本报太原8日电  中共山西省委最近召开了全省农村工作会议，研究讨论农业大跃进的新形势，提出了当前和明年农业生产的新任务。确定全省继小麦空前丰收之后，要力争实现秋季大丰收，并以“明年看今年”的精神，为争取明年更大丰收提早部署准备工作。
    会议研究和分析了去年冬季以来跃进再跃进的新形势，进一步批判了各种保守思想，对“基础太差、条件不行，要改变基础和条件只能渐进不能跃进”、“平川能跃进，山地区不能跃进”，以及对先进经验、先进指标和各地创造的新事物、新纪录采取怀疑、冷淡态度等各种保守思想，展开了大辩论。通过具体算账，同类地区对比等办法，打破了“条件论”的说法。大会分门别类地交流了各地积极领导群众跃进、克服困难的先进经验。会议并以实中求虚的精神，总结了全省小麦在极为不利的条件下取得丰收的经验，使大家明确认识在任何条件下，只要发挥人的作用，条件是可以转化的，低产地可以变成高产地，低产作物也可以转化为高产作物。会议经过谈虚论实展开思想批判，不少干部在理论上实践上明确和丰富了领导农业大跃进的思想和方法。
    会议在思想大解放的基础上，根据小麦空前丰收，当前秋季作物生长良好，以及各方面的跃进形势，对于今年农业生产的跃进指标重新作了研究，新的指标鼓舞了到会人员的干劲，他们一面讨论研究，一面打电报、电话、写信、派人回去传达会议精神，及时部署工作，上边开会下边行动、会里会外掀起竞赛。许多干部提出要学河南、追湖北，争取在秋季放射各种农作物高额丰产的“卫星”。
    会议认为1959年是更大跃进的一年，根据“明年看今年”的精神，必须在今年即提早作好准备工作，从现在就开始把今年的第三季度作为明年的第一季度，根据这种精神确定了明年的跃进指标。
    为了实现今年秋季大丰收和明年更大跃进，必须抓紧秋田的管理工作，同时积极进行明年更大跃进的准备工作。会议研究了十大措施：一、要在全省范围内提前在今年基本上实现水利、水土保持、植树造林改造自然的三大任务。二、开展土壤革命，要求平地深翻一尺二到一尺五，山地深翻一尺左右，今年二千万亩麦田全部深翻，到明年春耕前再深翻二千万亩秋田，到明年年底全部耕地深翻一遍。三、解决肥料问题，首先要重视农家肥料，小麦底肥要上到三万斤以上，各种农作物要施肥四万斤以上。另外要依靠工业，逐步做到县县有一个土制化学肥料厂，要提倡大量制造土化肥，要求亩亩平均施化肥四十到五十斤。四、精选优种，作到数量充足，品种多样化。五、大力推广密植，增加播种量，把所有的宽行耧统统改制成密植耧，旧耧一张不留。六、大力与虫害作斗争，明年要实现基本无虫省，要大力采取土办法制造杀害农药。七、搞大面积丰产地。八、抓两头，带中间，对所有的作物经常检查、排队、总结先进经验。九、进一步开展工具改革，并与机械化、化学、电气化、运输机械化等“四化”结合起来。十、把农业大跃进和文化革命结合起来。会议认为，从现在到秋收四个月期间主要是抓好田间管理工作，以分期管理为纲，贯彻农业技术措施，适时追肥、浇水、中耕、锄草，时时防止自然灾害，首先是防旱，一切措施应从此出发，即便是从现在到收获点雨不下，也要保证实现跃进任务。
    会议还根据适应新形势新任务的需要，讨论了农村工作的领导问题。大家认为，要以虚实并举，以虚带实，实中求虚的方针和方法，研究大跃进的规律，来指导大跃进。农村工作要以发展生产力为中心，作到三结合：所有农业部门结合；农业和工业部门结合；农业和文教部门结合。一切工作要以政治为统帅，人人要作政治工作。政治工作也要三结合：与处理人民内部矛盾结合；解放思想与改造自然相结合；社会主义现实教育与共产主义前途教育相结合。面临着这样巨大的任务，劳动力是一个非常重要的问题，会议研究了加强劳动力的组织管理工作，并且提出要发扬地区与地区、山地与平川、农业与工业大协作的精神，完成大跃进的任务。  （杨义）
