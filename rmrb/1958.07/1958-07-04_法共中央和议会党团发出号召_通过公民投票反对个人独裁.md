Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 3rd – The French Communist Party Central Committee and the Communist Party Parliamentary Group held a joint meeting on the 2nd, presided over by Duclos.

The meeting decided to convene a national party congress in Montreuil on July 17th or 18th. The national congress will have only one item on the agenda: all Republicans to act in unison, express a negative attitude in the referendum, and oppose a personal military dictatorship that paves the way for fascism. The speaker will be the party's General Secretary, Maurice Thorez.

In another communiqué issued after the meeting, the French Communist Party Central Committee and Parliamentary Group emphasized that De Gaulle, in his television address on June 27th, clearly stated that he refused to increase wages according to the demands of wage earners and civil servants. De Gaulle hopes to force workers to live in poverty and make them bear the costs of the Algerian war and the ongoing arms race.

The French Communist Party Central Committee and Parliamentary Group also pointed out in the communiqué that De Gaulle, while legalizing the act of replacing prefects with generals to control civil power, confirmed the measures taken by the rebellious elements of the so-called "Committees of Public Safety" in Algeria. On the other hand, in France, De Gaulle has entrusted important responsibilities to people who support personal power and military dictatorship. This clearly demonstrates the purpose he intends to achieve through the referendum to be held on October 5th, which is to provide a constitutional basis for personal and military dictatorship.

The communiqué said: The French Communist Party Central Committee and the Communist Party Parliamentary Group call on all Republicans without exception to work together to defeat the rebellious elements, organize more committees for the defense of the Republic, and launch a large-scale movement nationwide from now on to guide the majority of French people to say no to personal military dictatorship and no to fascism on October 5th.

    法共中央和议会党团发出号召
    通过公民投票反对个人独裁
    新华社巴黎3日电　法国共产党中央委员会和共产党议会党团2日举行联席会议，会议由杜克洛主持。
    会议决定在7月17或18日在蒙特勒伊召开党的全国代表会议。全国代表会议将只有一项议程：一切共和人士一致行动，在公民投票时表示否定态度并且反对为法西斯主义开辟道路的个人军事独裁。报告人是党的总书记莫里斯·多列士。
    法共中央委员会和议会党团在会后发表的另一项公报中强调指出：戴高乐在6月27日的电视广播演说中明确地声明，他拒绝按照工资收入者和公务员的要求增加工资。戴高乐希望迫使劳动者过贫困生活，并使他们担负阿尔及利亚战争和正在进行的军备竞赛的费用。
    法共中央委员会和议会党团在公报中还指出，戴高乐在下令使将军代替省长掌握民政权力成为合法化的同时，确认阿尔及利亚所谓“救国委员会”的暴乱分子采取的措施。另一方面，在法国，戴高乐把重要的责任交给支持个人权力和军事独裁的人们。这就明显地表现出他打算通过10月5日举行公民投票所要达到的目的，这就是给予个人独裁和军事独裁制以宪法根据。
    公报说：法共中央委员会和共产党议会党团号召全体共和人士毫无例外地协同努力以挫败暴乱分子，组织更多的保卫共和国委员会，并从现在起在全国范围内展开大规模运动，以便引导大多数法国人在10月5日表示不要个人军事独裁，不要法西斯主义。
