Xinhua News Agency, July 1st: The completion ceremony of the Ming Tombs Reservoir was held today. A grand gathering of 150,000 reservoir builders and nearby farmers took place on the construction site to celebrate the victorious completion of the entire reservoir project.

Today, the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site was a scene of festive joy. Countless red flags were planted on the summits of Mangshan Mountain, Hanbao Mountain, Dagu Mountain, and Yingbi Mountain. The five large characters "Ming Tombs Reservoir," inscribed by Chairman Mao, were inlaid in white marble on the southern slope of the flood-control dam, emitting a bright glow under the sunlight. A giant portrait of Chairman Mao towered over the center of the dam's roadway. A huge banner was hung on the tall water intake tower, reading: "The Completion of the Ming Tombs Reservoir is a Great Victory in Implementing the Party's General Line." The reservoir builders entered the venue singing the song "We Have Won." Farmers from around the reservoir also came to participate in this grand celebration of overcoming floods, bringing the old and the young. Some workers, farmers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, government cadres, school teachers and students, commercial staff, and literary and art workers who had already left the construction site, rushed from Beijing to celebrate. Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, and Chen Shutong, Mayor of Beijing Peng Zhen, Secretaries of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Liu Ren, Wan Li, Zhang Youyu, and Chen Peng, responsible persons of central and Beijing municipal-level organs, and senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who had participated in labor at the construction site, were all here today celebrating the completion of the reservoir with the reservoir builders. Diplomatic envoys and embassy staff from various countries stationed in China, experts from various countries in Beijing, and more than 1,200 foreign guests visiting China were also invited to attend the ceremony.

The Ming Tombs Reservoir project was fully completed on June 30th. The asphalt road on the dam crest is now open to traffic. The street lights along the road are brightly lit at night. The generators rushed out by the workers of Shanghai Hawsons Electric Company have been installed, waiting to store water for power generation. The 11.5-kilometer-long ring road around the lake has been fully completed. Xiaogushan, which is preparing to build a pavilion in the heart of the lake, has been heightened above the future water surface. In addition, new socialist villages, a wharf for boats of the National Defense Sports Association, and the Seven-Arch Bridge in the northern part of the reservoir are all under construction.

This reservoir, capable of holding more than 80 million cubic meters of water, was built entirely through voluntary labor. In the 160 days and nights since construction began on January 21st, 400,000 people labored at the construction site, totaling more than 8.7 million workdays. Among them were workers, farmers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, government cadres, school teachers and students, commercial staff, literary and art workers, religious followers, and street residents. They overcame the severe cold of winter, the wind and sand of spring, and the heat of summer, and finally completed the entire project before the arrival of the flood season.

During the construction of the reservoir, Chairman Mao and other members and alternate members of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the heads of various provinces and cities, as well as various departments of the central government and Beijing, marshals and generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations, all participated in labor at the construction site as ordinary laborers. Many ambassadors and embassy staff from various countries stationed in China, experts from various countries in Beijing, and foreign guests visiting China also participated in voluntary labor at the construction site.

At 4:00 p.m., the completion ceremony began, and the band played the national anthem. Then, Vice Premier Chen Yi cut the ribbon, officially announcing the complete completion of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, which was built by the hard work of 400,000 people.

Mayor Peng Zhen delivered a speech at the celebration meeting (the full text of the speech can be found on page three). In his speech, Mayor Peng Zhen extended warm congratulations and cordial greetings to all the builders who participated in the Ming Tombs Reservoir project, and expressed his deep gratitude to the many heads of missions from various countries to China and foreign friends who participated in reservoir labor. He warmly welcomed the diplomatic envoys and foreign guests stationed in China who were invited to attend today's ceremony.

After Peng Zhen's speech, he presented certificates of merit to the representatives of the labor armies from all walks of life. Over the past five months, 2,685 advanced collectives and more than 19,000 model individuals have emerged on this construction site.

After the ceremony, central leading comrades and heads of various departments, accompanied by Luo Wenfang, the general commander of the Ming Tombs Reservoir Construction Headquarters, and Zhao Fan, the political commissar, reviewed the ranks of the builders and inspected various projects by car around the reservoir.

At 4:50 p.m., the celebration and get-together activities began. At this time, balloons rose into the air from the jubilant crowd, people beat gongs and drums, set off firecrackers, sang and danced, and performed programs about the new people and new things in the construction of the reservoir. More than 30 art troupes from Beijing also performed wonderful programs for the people participating in the get-together. The enthusiastic and joyful crowd reveled until late at night.

    贯彻执行总路线的伟大胜利
    十三陵水库建成
    十五万人昨日欢腾庆祝
    据新华社1日讯　十三陵水库今天举行落成典礼。水库建设者和附近农民共十五万人在工地上举行盛大集会，庆祝水库全部工程胜利完工。
    今天，十三陵水库工地一片节日景象。无数面红旗插上了蟒山、汉包山、大孤山和影壁山山顶。毛主席题的“十三陵水库”五个大字，用汉白玉镶嵌在拦洪大坝的南坡，在阳光照耀下发出皎洁的光辉。毛主席的巨幅画像高耸在坝顶马路的中央。高大的进水塔上悬着一幅巨大的标语，上面写着：“十三陵水库建成是贯彻执行党的总路线的伟大胜利”。水库建设者们高唱着“我们胜利了”的歌曲进入会场。水库周围的农民也扶老携幼来参加这个战胜洪水的盛典，有些已经离开工地的工人、农民、解放军官兵、机关干部、学校师生、商业工作人员、文艺工作者们，从北京城赶来庆祝。曾经到工地参加劳动的副总理陈毅，副委员长李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通，北京市市长彭真，中共北京市委书记刘仁、万里、张友渔、陈鹏，中央、北京市级机关的负责人和中国人民解放军的高级将领，今天都在这里和水库建设者们一同庆祝水库的建成。各国驻华使节和使馆人员、在北京的各国专家以及来我国访问的外宾一千二百多人也应邀参加了典礼。
    十三陵水库工程已经在6月30日全部完工。坝顶柏油马路已经通车。马路旁的路灯入夜通明。上海华生电器厂职工们赶制的发电机安装完毕，就等着蓄洪发电。十一点五公里长的环湖公路全线修通。准备修湖心亭的小孤山已加高出未来的水面。另外，社会主义新村、国防体育协会停泊船只用的码头和水库北部的七孔桥等工程都正在兴建。
    这个能容八千多万立方公尺水量的水库是全部用义务劳动修建起来的。在1月21日开工以来的一百六十个昼夜中，有四十万人到工地劳动，共做了八百七十多万个工作日。其中有工人、农民、解放军官兵、机关干部、学校师生、商业工作人员、文艺工作者、宗教徒和街道居民。他们战胜了冬天的严寒、春天的风砂和夏天的炎热，终于在洪水到来之前，完成了全部工程。
    在水库兴建期间，毛主席和中共中央其他委员、候补委员，各省市委以及中央机关各部门和北京市的负责人，中国人民解放军的元帅和将军们，各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人，都以一个普通劳动者的身份到工地来参加了劳动。很多国家驻我国的大使和大使馆人员、在北京的各国专家和访问我国的外宾，也到工地参加了义务劳动。
    下午四时，落成典礼开始，乐队奏起国歌。接着，陈毅副总理剪彩，正式宣告这个经过四十万人辛勤修建的十三陵水库全部建成。
    彭真市长在庆祝大会上讲了话（讲话全文见三版）。彭真市长在讲话中向参加十三陵水库工程的全体建设者表示热烈的祝贺和亲切的慰问，并向参加水库劳动的许多国家驻我国的使节和外国朋友们表示深切的感谢。他热烈欢迎应邀参加今天典礼的驻我国的外交使节和外宾们。
    彭真讲话后，把奖状授给了各路劳动大军的代表。五个多月来，这个工地上涌现出两千六百八十五个先进集体和一万九千多个模范人物。
    典礼结束，中央领导同志和各部门负责人在十三陵水库修建总指挥部总指挥罗文坊、政治委员赵凡陪同下，检阅了建设者的队伍，并且乘车绕水库一周，视察了各项工程。
    四时五十分，庆祝联欢活动开始。这时，狂欢的人群中升起了气球，人们敲打着锣鼓，燃放着鞭炮，载歌载舞，表演了建设水库的新人新事的节目。从北京赶来的三十多个文艺团体也分别为联欢的人们演出了精彩的节目。热情的、欢乐的人群一直狂欢到深夜。（附图片）
