Examining My Wife

Master Wang, all smiles,
Runs home with the newspaper,
Asks his wife as he enters:
Do you know of the important event?

Mother Wang, even happier,
Opens her mouth and speaks of the General Line.
Master Wang, stunned,
How did you know so quickly?

Oh my, don't be surprised,
Our family members also study.
(Inspection Department, Zhang Fushan)

Creating Heaven and Earth

Soaring drive,
Drilling force breaks the earth,
Drive plus drilling force,
Creates heaven and splits the earth!
(Locomotive Workshop, Zhang Xiuli)

Little Carpenter

I am a little carpenter,
Axe in hand, ready to go,
Not afraid of the Yellow River blocking the way,
Not afraid of high mountains stopping the horse,
"Time"! Let's have a race,
See who catches up with Su Guangming first.
(Passenger Car Workshop, Wang Xianzeng)

New Apprentice

A new apprentice comes to the workshop,
Following the workers to learn.
Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of dirt,
Kind and humble to others.

Everyone praises him as a good apprentice,
He is Secretary Lin of the Municipal Party Committee.
(Inspection Department, Zhang Fushan)

    哈尔滨机车修理厂工人诗选
    考老伴
    王师傅，笑哈哈，
    手拿报纸跑回家，
    见了老伴开口问：
    有件大事知道吗？
    王大娘，更喜欢，
    开口就说总路线。
    王师傅，发了呆，
    你怎么知道这么快？
    哎呀呀，别惊奇，
    我们家属也学习。

    开天辟地
    干劲冲天，
    钻劲辟地，
    干劲加钻劲，
    开天又辟地！
    （机车间　张秀丽）
    小木匠
    我是一个小木匠，
    手握斧头把马上，
    不怕黄河把路拦，
    不怕高山将马挡，
    “时间”！咱俩比一比，
    看谁先把苏广铭撵上。
    （客车间　王宪曾）
    新徒弟
    车间来个新徒弟，
    跟着工人来学习。
    不怕苦，不怕脏，
    待人和蔼又谦虚。
    人人都夸他是好徒弟，
    他就是市委林书记。
    （检查科　张福山）
