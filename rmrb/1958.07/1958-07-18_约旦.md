Jordan is located in the northwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula, bordering Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, and Israel. It covers an area of approximately 96,500 square kilometers. It has a population of about 1.4 million, the vast majority of whom are Arabs. The capital of Jordan is Amman.

    Jordan is a backward agricultural country. Most of its eastern part is desert, while the Jordan River valley in the west has fertile land suitable for cultivation. Underground, it possesses minerals such as potassium phosphate, salt, and iron.

    Jordan was originally part of Palestine. From the beginning of the 16th century, it was ruled by the Turks and belonged to the Damascus province of the Ottoman Empire. After World War I, the Ottoman Empire collapsed, and Palestine became a British mandate. To facilitate the invasion of the Middle East, Britain implemented a policy of "divide and rule." In 1922, Britain divided Palestine into eastern and western parts along the Jordan River. The western part remained Palestine, and the eastern part was called Transjordan. Britain established a British colonial authority-managed emirate in Transjordan.

    In March 1946, amid the rising tide of the Arab national liberation movement, Britain was forced to recognize the independence of Transjordan, naming the country the "Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan," with the former Emir Abdullah becoming king.

    During the 1948 Palestine War, Transjordanian forces occupied part of Palestine, with territory spanning both sides of the Jordan River. In 1949, it was renamed the "Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan."

    After Jordan's independence, Britain continued to exert its control over Jordan in military, political, and economic aspects. As early as 1923, Britain established the so-called "Arab Legion" in Jordan, commanded by British General Glubb, to control Jordan. In 1948, Britain forced Jordan to sign the "Anglo-Jordanian Treaty of Alliance." According to this treaty, Britain had the right to occupy two air bases in Amman and Mafraq and station British troops in Jordan indefinitely. This treaty seriously violated Jordan's sovereignty.

    After World War II, American influence gradually penetrated Jordan. In December 1951, the United States induced Jordan to sign the "Point Four Program" agreement. In May 1954, it signed the "Economic Assistance Agreement." Since then, the United States has tried to squeeze out British influence in Jordan.

    With the rising tide of anti-colonialist struggle among the people of the Middle East, the people of Jordan have increasingly and resolutely opposed imperialist rule and demanded national independence. In March 1956, under pressure from the people, King Hussein of Jordan (who acceded to the throne in 1953) dismissed Glubb, the British commander of the "Arab Legion." During the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, the Jordanian people's support for Egypt and opposition to colonialism grew even stronger. As a result, when Jordan held parliamentary elections in October 1956, nationalist parties advocating the maintenance of national independence and the pursuit of a policy of active neutrality won a major victory and formed a cabinet headed by Nabulsi.

    The Nabulsi cabinet actively pursued a policy of peace and neutrality to safeguard sovereignty and independence, advocated strengthening unity with Egypt and Syria, opposed the Baghdad Pact and the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and announced the abolition of the "Anglo-Jordanian Treaty of Alliance" in November 1956. Such a government was deeply hated by imperialism. In April 1957, the United States subverted the Jordanian nationalist regime. The Hussein dynasty completely sided with imperialism, accepted the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and brutally suppressed nationalist forces domestically.

    In February of this year, Jordan and Iraq announced the formation of the "Arab Federation," antagonizing the United Arab Republic and splitting the unity of the Arab peoples. After the outbreak of the uprising against the Chamoun government in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq sent troops to Lebanon to help the reactionary Lebanese government suppress the people's uprising. After the people of Iraq achieved revolutionary victory this time, overthrowing the Faisal dynasty and announcing their withdrawal from the "Arab Federation," King Hussein of Jordan, under the instigation of imperialism, actually announced that he would replace Faisal in exercising the power of the head of the "Arab Federation" and demanded that the United States and Britain send troops to Jordan, paving the way for US-British imperialist intervention in the Republic of Iraq.

    约旦
    约旦位于阿拉伯半岛西北部，四周同沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、叙利亚和以色列接境。面积约九万六千五百平方公里。人口约一百四十万，绝大多数是阿拉伯人。约旦的首都是安曼。
    约旦是一个落后的农业国家，它的东部大部为沙漠地，西部约旦河流域土地肥沃，适于耕种。地下蕴藏着磷酸钾、盐、铁等矿产。
    约旦原来是巴勒斯坦的一部分，从十六世纪初叶起，曾被土耳其人统治，属于奥斯曼帝国的大马士革省。第一次世界大战后，奥斯曼帝国瓦解，巴勒斯坦变成了英国的委任统治地。英国为了便于侵略中东各国人民，便执行了“分而治之”的政策。1922年，英国以约旦河为界，把巴勒斯坦分割为东西两部，西部仍称巴勒斯坦，东部称为外约旦，并在外约旦建立了英国殖民当局管理下的酋长国。
    1946年3月，在阿拉伯国家民族解放运动高涨的形势下，英国被迫承认外约旦的独立，定国名为“哈希姆外约旦王国”，原酋长阿卜杜勒称王。
    1948年巴勒斯坦战争时期，外约旦军队占领了巴勒斯坦的一部分土地，领土横跨约旦河两岸。1949年改名为“哈希姆约旦王国”。
    约旦独立后，英国仍极力保持它对约旦的军事、政治和经济各方面的控制。早在1923年，英国就在约旦建立了所谓“阿拉伯军团”，由英国将军格拉布任司令，以控制约旦。1948年，英国强迫约旦签订了“英—约同盟条约”。根据这个条约，英国有权占领在安曼和麦法拉克的两个空军基地，并在约旦无限期驻扎英国军队。这个条约严重地侵犯了约旦的主权。
    第二次世界大战后，美国势力步步渗入约旦。1951年12月，美国诱迫约旦签订“第四点计划”协定。1954年5月，又签订了“经济援助协定”。此后，美国竭力排挤英国在约旦的势力。
    随着中东人民反殖民主义斗争的高涨，约旦人民日益坚决地反对帝国主义统治，要求民族独立。1956年3月，约旦侯赛因国王（1953年接任王位）在人民的压力下，解除了“阿拉伯军团”的英国司令格拉布的职务。在英法以侵略埃及时期，约旦人民支持埃及，反对殖民主义的情绪更加高涨。结果，在1956年10月约旦举行议会选举时，主张维护民族独立和奉行积极中立政策的民族主义政党取得重大胜利，并组成了以纳布西为首的内阁。
    纳布西内阁积极奉行维护主权和独立的和平中立政策，主张加强同埃及和叙利亚的团结，反对巴格达条约和“艾森豪威尔主义”，并于1956年11月，宣布废除“英—约同盟条约”。这样的政府深受帝国主义的仇视。1957年4月，美国颠复了约旦民族主义政权。侯赛因王朝完全投靠帝国主义，接受“艾森豪威尔主义”，对内血腥镇压民族主义力量。
    今年2月，约旦和伊拉克宣布结成“阿拉伯联邦”，敌对阿拉伯联合共和国，分裂阿拉伯各国人民的团结。黎巴嫩爆发反对夏蒙政府的起义后，约旦和伊拉克就派遣军队前往黎巴嫩，帮助黎巴嫩反动政府镇压人民起义。这次伊拉克人民取得革命胜利，推翻了费萨尔王朝，宣布退出“阿拉伯联邦”后，约旦侯赛因国王在帝国主义指使下，竟宣布要代替费萨尔行使“阿拉伯联邦”元首的权力，并要求美英派军队进入约旦，为美英帝国主义干涉伊拉克共和国铺路。
