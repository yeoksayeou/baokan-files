Why?

    When cooking a pot of congee or noodles, it easily boils over, but boiling a pot of plain water does not. This is because when water boils, it means the water vapor molecules are trying to surge from inside the water to the surface, hence the phenomenon of boiling. Normally, water vapor molecules can escape if they overcome the attraction (mutual force) between the water molecules on the surface. However, when there is rice, noodles, or oil in the water, besides the mutual attraction of water molecules on the surface, there is also the obstruction of the rice or oil. Water vapor molecules need more force to resist this surface resistance in order to escape. Because they use more force, they often surge out all at once, carrying layers of congee foam or oil foam out of the pot. Especially when cooking noodles, the overly thick noodle soup is most likely to surge out because there are too many starch particles in the water, and the attraction between them increases the resistance of the water surface.

专栏：为什么？

    熬粥容易漫出锅来
    一锅粥或是一锅面煮开时往往容易漫出锅来，而烧一锅清水就不容易漫出来。这是因为水煮开了就表示水的蒸汽分子要由水里涌到水面上，所以才有沸腾的现象。平时水汽分子只要能突破水面的水分子之间的拉力（相互吸力）就能跑出来了。可是当水里有许多米、面或油时，除了水表面的水分子的相互拉力之外，还有米或油等的阻碍。水汽分子要想跑出来就需要用较多的力气抵抗这种表面的阻力。由于用劲大，所以时常是一涌而出，一层层地把粥沫或油沫一齐带到锅外面来了。特别是在煮面条的时候，过于粘稠的面汤最易涌出来，这是因为水中的淀粉粒子太多，它们之间的拉力增加了水面的阻力。
