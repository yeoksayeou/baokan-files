Xinhua News Agency, July 25th, London Dispatch: A British Foreign Office spokesman, at a press conference on the 24th, issued a statement regarding Khrushchev's reply to Macmillan, stating that the British government was "pleased that Mr. Khrushchev appears to have accepted our suggestion to convene a special meeting of the (UN) Security Council. We are studying some of the details and new formulations contained in his reply."

However, the Foreign Office spokesman considered the Soviet suggestion to convene this special meeting on the 28th (next Monday) as "unrealistic." He said that the British government is "completely willing to meet, provided that the Security Council special meeting can be properly organized."

According to Reuters, British officials believe that a meeting cannot be convened quickly. It said that the meeting will be convened "within two or three weeks," with the most likely date being "August 10th," because Western countries must have time to "coordinate their views." The "Daily Telegraph" also called for "slowing down the pace" of convening the Security Council special meeting, citing the need to avoid "serious rifts" between Western countries.

Xinhua News Agency, July 25th, Paris Dispatch: French Government Minister of Information Soustelle said on the 24th that de Gaulle had not yet made a decision on whether to go to New York to participate in a summit meeting.

Soustelle said that the French government is scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting on the 25th, presided over by de Gaulle, to decide its final attitude towards this meeting. He said that the French government "will probably reply on July 26th" to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's letter regarding the summit meeting issue because now "France is consulting with its allies, especially with the United States and Britain."

Soustelle said that holding a meeting in New York under the auspices of the United Nations "is conceivable for the French government." He also said that France hopes to hold a summit meeting on the Middle East issue in a "completely objective and calm" atmosphere and that the French Prime Minister is prepared to participate in a summit meeting that "can make a decision within forty-eight hours without having to drag on endlessly."

When discussing the member countries of this meeting, Soustelle expressed reservations about inviting representatives of Arab countries to participate, saying that if the Arabs participate, then "the possible participants in the meeting will be endless."

Xinhua News Agency, July 25th, Washington Dispatch: White House Press Secretary Hagerty told reporters that US President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles had drafted the US reply to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's letter of the 23rd on the afternoon of the 24th, and it had been given to the British and French governments for study.

Hagerty said that Eisenhower and Dulles began drafting the reply in the morning. The National Security Council also held a meeting at the White House in the morning. After the meeting, Eisenhower and Dulles continued to draft the reply. The reply was finalized after the two met again in the afternoon.

Hagerty declined to answer whether the US government believed that holding a summit meeting within the framework of the Security Council on July 28th was feasible, but he said in response to another question that Dulles's plan to visit Europe this weekend and Italian Prime Minister Fanfani's plan to visit Washington next week have not changed in any way.

    英官方要求“步伐放慢”
    法国正在同美英磋商
    新华社25日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人24日在记者招待会上就赫鲁晓夫给麦克米伦的复信发表声明说：英国政府“高兴的是：赫鲁晓夫先生看来接受了我们关于召开（联合国）安全理事会特别会议的建议。我们正在研究他的复信中所包含的一些细节和新的提法”。
    但是，外交部发言人认为，苏联建议在28日（下星期一）召开这次特别会议是“不现实”的，他说，英国政府“完全愿意会晤，只要能合适地组织安理会特别会议就行”。
    据路透社报道，英国官方人士认为，会议不可能迅速召开。它说，会议将在“两三个星期以内”召开，最可能的日期是“8月10日”，因为西方国家必须有时间来“协调他们的看法”。“每日电讯报”也以必须避免西方国家之间发生“严重的裂痕”为理由，要求把召开安理会特别会议的“步伐放慢”。
    新华社25日讯　巴黎消息：法国政府宣传部长苏斯戴尔24日说：戴高乐还没有就是否到纽约去参加政府首脑会议的问题作出决定。
    苏斯戴尔说，法国政府定在25日在戴高乐的主持下举行内阁会议来决定它对待这次会议的最后态度。他说：法国政府“大概要在7月26日”答复苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫关于高级会议问题的信件，因为现在“法国正在同自己的盟国，特别是同美国和英国进行磋商”。
    苏斯戴尔说：在联合国的主持下在纽约举行会议“对法国政府来说是可以想像的”。他还说：法国希望在“完全客观和安静”的气氛下举行一次关于中东问题的最高级会议，法国总理准备参加一次“能够在四十八小时以内作出决定而不必无止境地拖延下去”的最高级会议。
    在谈到这次会议的成员国问题时，苏斯戴尔对于邀请阿拉伯国家的代表参加这次会议表示了保留的态度，他说，如果阿拉伯人参加会议，那末“会议的可能参加者将无止境”。
    新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂对记者说，美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯24日下午已经拟就了美国对苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫23日来信的复信，并且已经交给英国和法国政府研究。
    哈格蒂说，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯这一天早上就开始草拟复信。国家安全委员会从早晨起也在白宫举行了会议。在会议结束以后，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯两人继续草拟复信。这封复信在他们二人在下午再次会面以后最后写成。
    哈格蒂拒绝回答美国政府是否认为7月28日在安全理事会范围内召开高级会议切实可行的问题，但是他在回答另一个问题时说，杜勒斯在本周末去欧洲访问的计划和意大利总理范范尼在下周来华盛顿访问的计划没有任何改变。
