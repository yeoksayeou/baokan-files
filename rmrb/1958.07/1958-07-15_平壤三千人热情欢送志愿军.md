Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 14th. Today, more than three thousand people in Pyongyang warmly saw off a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning home, as it passed through Pyongyang.

Today, the Pyongyang Railway Station building was festively decorated, with portraits of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong hanging high above, along with a huge banner: "The great achievements of the heroic officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers will forever shine in the history of our country."

At 4:00 p.m., a train full of Volunteers entered Pyongyang Station amidst the majestic song of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Leading cadres such as Park Se-byong, Vice Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, first shook hands with the officers and soldiers of the Volunteers. Then, crowds holding the national flags of both Korea and China and flowers, shouted "Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!" and rushed to the doors of each carriage, scattering handfuls of colored paper scraps over the Volunteers, and pinning big red flowers on the officers' and soldiers' chests. Soldiers of the People's Army also enthusiastically lifted up the Volunteer soldiers.

Amidst the music, the well-wishers and the Volunteer officers and soldiers danced the Korean collective dance "Eongheya" on the platform. Elderly Korean women with white hair also danced with the soldiers. Actors from the Korean National Art Theatre performed wonderful song and dance programs for the Volunteers. At 5:00 p.m., amidst cries of "Goodbye," the Volunteers boarded the train and headed north, bidding farewell to heroic Pyongyang. (Attached pictures)

    平壤三千人热情欢送志愿军
    新华社平壤14日电　今天，平壤三千多人，在车站上热烈欢送路经平壤的一支中国人民志愿军归国部队。
    平壤车站大楼，今天披起了盛装，上面高悬金日成首相、毛泽东主席的画像和巨幅标语：“英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵们所发挥的伟大功勋，永远辉煌在我们祖国的历史上”。
    下午四时，满载着志愿军的列车，在雄壮的中国人民志愿军战歌声中，驶入平壤车站。平壤市人民委员会副委员长朴世秉等领导干部首先同志愿军官兵握手相见，接着手执着朝中两国国旗和鲜花的群众，高呼“中国人民志愿军万岁！”一齐涌向各个车厢门口，把一把把彩色纸屑撒到志愿军身上，把一朵朵大红花挂到官兵们胸前，人民军战士还热情地把志愿军战士抬起来。
    在音乐声中，欢送群众和志愿军官兵在月台上跳起了朝鲜集体舞“嗡嘿呀”，白发苍苍的朝鲜老大娘也同战士们一起跳起舞来。朝鲜国立艺术剧场的演员为志愿军演出了精彩的歌舞节目。下午五时，在一片“再见”声中，志愿军乘车北上，告别了英雄的平壤。（附图片）
