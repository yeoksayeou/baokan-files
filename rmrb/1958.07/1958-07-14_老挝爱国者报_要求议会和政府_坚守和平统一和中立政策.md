Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 13th: Vientiane News: The "Lao Patriotic Newspaper" recently published an editorial demanding that the Lao National Assembly and government wage a resolute struggle against foreign countries and their lackeys in Laos who are undermining Laos' peaceful reunification and neutrality policy.

The editorial pointed out that Prince Souvanna Phouma's government, based on the Geneva Accords and the agreement signed between the Royal Government and the former Lao Fighting Forces, unified Laos, established a coalition government, and conducted supplementary elections for the National Assembly. Prince Souvanna Phouma's government declared its commitment to neutrality, friendship with all countries, and sent delegations to neighboring countries to enhance mutual friendship.

The editorial pointed out, however, that the Lao Royal Government has not thoroughly implemented the above points. This is manifested in: Internally, Laos' reunification cause has not been completed. Only seven months after the establishment of the coalition government, some people are trying to exclude personnel from the former Lao Fighting Forces. Cadres of the former Lao Fighting Forces who have been incorporated into the Lao Royal Government institutions have not been assessed for rank or received positions; soldiers of the former Lao Fighting Forces who have been incorporated into the Royal Army have not received the same care as soldiers of the national army. Some demobilized personnel of the former Lao Fighting Forces have been discriminated against and retaliated against after returning to their hometowns, some of whom have been arrested, murdered, intimidated, and insulted. The editorial pointed out that externally, the Lao Royal Government has not achieved true neutrality. For example, the Royal Government has only established relations with one side of countries. Some national leaders sometimes announce that they will stand on one side to oppose the other. Recently, a draft law on suppressing actions against the Kingdom was proposed in the National Assembly. The editorial pointed out that such words and deeds not only affect friendly relations with some neighboring countries, but also violate the policy of peaceful neutrality.

The editorial pointed out that the reason for this situation is that some foreigners are trying to undermine the agreements reached by both sides in Laos, preventing Laos from achieving unification and tranquility. They are trying their best to threaten Prince Souvanna Phouma, saying that they will stop giving "aid" to Laos and demanding that the Lao currency be devalued. These practices are attempts to force the Lao Royal Government not to implement the agreements between the two sides and the policy of peaceful neutrality.

The editorial finally demanded that the Lao National Assembly and government, especially the Lao Royal Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma, take responsibility for the current problems and for the fate of the country.

The "Lao Patriotic Newspaper" also recently published an article demanding that members of the Lao National Assembly resolutely oppose the so-called draft law on suppressing actions against the Kingdom in order to protect the people's democratic and free rights.

The article pointed out that some people in Laos are trying to make the National Assembly pass this draft law, which stipulates that people who are said to have a tendency to support the communist system in propaganda and action should be arrested, fined, and deprived of their political rights. The draft law also stipulates that all other laws that conflict with this law should be repealed. The article pointed out that if this draft law is passed, it would mean that the law passed by the Lao National Assembly on October 1, 1957, which stipulates the people's democratic and free rights, and the agreement on the implementation of the policy of peaceful neutrality signed on November 2, 1956, by the political delegations of the Royal Government and the former Lao Fighting Forces, which was recognized as law by the National Assembly, will be repealed.

The article pointed out that Lao Royal Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma and most members of parliament disagree with passing this draft law immediately and have submitted it to the National Assembly's Legal and Political Committee for study. However, the article pointed out that submitting this draft law to the National Assembly has already cast a shadow of dictatorship over Laos.

The article finally pointed out that this draft law is of no benefit to the Lao people; it only conforms to the intentions of foreign reactionaries who are trying to interfere in Laos. The people of Laos must fight to defend the democratic system.

### “老挝爱国者报”要求议会和政府  坚守和平统一和中立政策

    “老挝爱国者报”要求议会和政府
    坚守和平统一和中立政策
    新华社河内13日电　万象消息：“老挝爱国者报”最近发表社论，要求老挝国民议会和政府对破坏老挝和平统一和中立政策的外国及其在老挝的仆从进行坚决的斗争。
    社论指出，富马亲王的政府曾经根据日内瓦协议和王国政府同前寮国战斗部队之间签订的协议，使老挝得到统一，成立了联合政府，并且进行了国民议会的补充选举。富马亲王的政府曾经宣布要坚守中立，同各国友好，并且曾经派代表团到各邻邦进行访问，以增进相互间的友谊。
    社论指出，但是，老挝王国政府对上述各点执行得不够彻底。这种情况表现在：在对内方面，老挝的统一事业还没有完成。联合政府刚刚成立七个月，就有人力图排斥前寮国战斗部队的人员。并入老挝王国政府机构的前寮国战斗部队的干部还没有评定级别和得到职位；并入王国军队的前寮国战斗部队的官兵也没有得到像国家军队官兵受到的同样照顾。一部分前寮国战斗部队的复员人员回乡以后就遭到歧视和报复，其中有的遭到逮捕、杀害、恫吓和辱骂。社论指出，在对外方面，老挝王国政府还没有做到真正的中立。例如王国政府只同一方面的国家建立了关系。有的国家领导人员有时还宣布要站在一方面来反对另一方面。最近，还在国民议会里提出了所谓肃清反对王国行动的法令草案。社论指出，这类言行不但影响了同一些邻邦的友好关系，而且违反了和平中立政策。
    社论指出，所以发生这种情况，是由于有一些外国人企图破坏老挝双方达成的协议，不让老挝得到统一和安宁。他们极力威胁富马亲王，说要停止给予老挝的“援助”，并且要求贬低老挝的币值。这些作法都是企图迫使老挝王国政府不执行双方协议和和平中立政策。
    社论最后要求老挝国民议会和政府，尤其是老挝王国首相富马亲王对当前所发生的问题负起责任，对国家的命运负起责任。
    “老挝爱国者报”最近还发表了文章，要求老挝国民议会的议员坚决反对所谓肃清反对王国行动的法令草案，以保障人民的民主自由权利。
    文章指出，老挝某些人企图使国民议会通过的这项法令草案规定，要对所谓在宣传和行动上有拥护共产主义制度趋向的人进行逮捕、罚款和剥夺他们的政治权利。法令草案还规定，同这项法令相违背的一切其它法令都要取消。文章指出，如果这项法令草案获得通过，这就意味着，老挝国民议会在1957年10月1日通过的规定了人民民主自由权利的法令，以及经国民议会承认为法令的王国政府和前寮国战斗部队的政治代表团在1956年11月2日签订的关于实施和平中立政策的协议都将被取消。
    文章指出，老挝王国首相富马亲王和大多数议员不同意马上通过这项法令草案，并且把它提交给国民议会的法律和政治委员会研究。但是，文章指出，把这项法令草案提交国民议会，已经在老挝出现了独裁的阴影。
    文章最后指出，对老挝人民说来，这项法令草案是一点好处都没有的，它只符合企图干涉老挝的外国反动分子的意图。老挝全国人民必须为保卫民主制度而进行斗争。
