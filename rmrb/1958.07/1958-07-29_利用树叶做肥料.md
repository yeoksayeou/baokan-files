　　Using Tree Leaves as Fertilizer
　　Liao Sheng
　　Summer is the season when trees are lush with foliage. Seizing this time to collect and pick tree leaves for composting can yield a lot of fertilizer. Many regions use methods like "cutting green," "pressing green," and "composting green," and one of the main raw materials for making green manure is tree leaves.
　　Tree leaves contain abundant organic matter, which can improve the soil. At the same time, organic nitrogen is broken down to produce ammonium, which can meet the crop's need for nitrogen. The many types and large quantity of tree leaves, which can be harvested several times a year, are some of the advantages of using tree leaves for composting. Applying tree leaves to sticky paddy fields not only increases various nutrients but also promotes soil loosening, helps the propagation of beneficial bacteria, and accelerates fertilizer decomposition. Furthermore, because it produces organic colloids after decomposition, applying it to sandy soil can make the sand finer, form a granular structure, and enhance water and fertilizer retention. In mountain gullies and cold paddy fields, trampling tree leaves and tender branches into the soil in spring can raise the soil temperature due to fermentation, promoting the growth and development of seedlings. For example, in Xingfu Cooperative of Renhexi Township, Qianyang, Hunan, there are 1,500 mu of rice fields, 30% of which are mountain and cold soaked fields. The general fields also have low soil temperature and poor soil quality, making them unsuitable for double cropping. However, due to the large application of tree leaves as fertilizer (accounting for about 70% of the total fertilizer application), the yield has increased year by year. In 1956, the average yield of rice per mu in the cooperative's 856 mu of fields was more than 482 jin.
　　Some green leaves contain toxins of varying degrees, which can kill pests and weeds after being applied to paddy fields.
　　When using tree leaves for composting, try to compost them in the field as soon as they are picked to avoid wind, sun, and rain. This is because fresh tree leaves will dry out if they are not composted in time. After drying, the fibers of the leaves harden, the protein dehydrates into a gel, and the tissue shrinks, making it difficult to rot and the effective nutrients difficult to decompose.
　　The method of using "ponds" to compost green manure in some southern areas is very good. This method can also be used for composting tree leaves. In some areas of Hunan, five "ponds" are set up per mu of land, and each pond can hold four or five dan of tree leaves. The composting time is generally ten to fifteen days.
　　Applying green manure to the base of rice plants ("He Dou Qing") is another method of using tree leaves to make fertilizer. This involves evenly spreading the picked tree leaves between the rows of rice plants ten to thirty days after transplanting, then trampling them into the mud while applying lime to promote their decomposition. The amount of green manure trampled per mu depends on the soil quality and the tree leaves, generally 1,000 to 2,000 jin, while simultaneously spreading 40 to 50 jin of lime.
　　In some areas, green grass and tree leaves are also used as bedding in pig and cattle pens, and then turned into fertilizer by trampling by pigs and cattle. Green manure composted in this way is more effective because it is mixed with pig and cattle manure.

    利用树叶做肥料
    廖升
    夏季正是树木枝叶茂盛时期。抓紧这个时期收集和采摘它来沤肥，就可以得到很多的肥料。许多地区群众采用的“割青”、“压青”、“沤青”等方法沤制绿肥的主要原料之一，就是树叶。
    树叶含丰富的有机质，能改良土壤；同时，有机态的氮被分解而产生铵，能供给作物对氮的需要。树叶种类多、数量大，一年可以采摘几次，这也是用树叶沤肥的一些优点。树叶施在粘泥田里，既增加各种肥分，又能促进土壤松软，帮助有益细菌繁殖，加速肥料分解；又因它分解后产生有机胶，施在沙泥田内，能使沙泥细腻，形成团粒结构，增强保水保肥效能。在山沟里和温度低的水田，春天踩入树叶和嫩枝后，因发酵而增高土温，促使禾苗生长发育。如湖南黔阳稔禾溪乡幸福社有一千五百亩稻田，30％是山冲田、冷浸田，一般的田也是泥温低，土质差，不适宜复种，但由于大量施树叶作肥料（占总施肥量70％左右），产量逐年上升，1956年全社八百五十六亩田平均亩产稻谷四百八十二斤多。
    有些青叶含有轻重不同毒素，施入稻田后，可杀死害虫杂草。
    用树叶沤制肥料的时候，尽可能做到采摘下来以后就沤在田里，避免风吹日晒雨淋。这是因为新鲜树叶，如不及时沤制，日久就会晒干。干后的树叶纤维硬化，蛋白质脱水变成凝胶体，组织紧缩，因而不易腐烂，有效养分不易分解出来。
    南方一些地方用“凼”沤制绿肥的方法很好。用树叶沤肥也可以采用这种方法。湖南一些地区每亩地设“凼”五个，每凼可放树叶四、五担，沤制时间一般是十到十五天。
    施禾蔸青是另一种利用树叶制肥料的方法。禾蔸青是在插秧后十到三十天内，把采摘的树叶均匀的铺列在禾行中间，然后踩入泥中，同时加施石灰，促使它腐烂。每亩踩青量看土质和树叶而决定，一般是一、二千斤，同时撒放石灰四、五十斤。
    有些地区也有把青草和树叶垫猪牛栏，通过猪、牛踩踏成肥的。经过这样踩沤的绿肥，因为混有猪、牛粪尿，肥效更高。
