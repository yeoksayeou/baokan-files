To Constantly Break and Establish
    Cheng Pu
    After agricultural cooperativization, agricultural production technology and farming methods began a process of breaking and establishing: breaking away from the backward production habits and farming methods under individual economic conditions, and establishing production technologies and farming methods suitable for large-scale production conditions that could accelerate the rate of increased production. During the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, new production technologies are increasingly replacing outdated production technologies on a wider scale, and advanced measures for increasing production are being mastered and applied by more and more people. However, the process of breaking and establishing has not been completed. Because even in advanced areas, the old rules and bad habits left over from the period of individual management still have a certain binding force. In order to clear obstacles for the leap forward in agricultural production, it is necessary to continue breaking the old and establishing the new in order to establish a new set of farming systems suitable for large-scale production conditions. From this point of view, the practice of the Party organization of Liucun Village in Anguo County, Hebei Province, leading farmers to break away from old experiences in summer field management is very worthy of attention.
    The key to breaking old farming methods and production habits lies in making the masses fully aware of the tremendous changes in production conditions since the Great Leap Forward, breaking superstitions, and daring to think and act. Old production experiences that once prevailed among farmers in Liucun Village, Anguo County, such as "Eating a full meal if there is drought in May" and "Too much fertilizer burns the seedlings," all reflected the farmers' powerlessness in field management under the conditions of lacking water, fertilizer, and labor in the period of individual management. Today's production conditions have completely changed: the capacity for irrigation has greatly improved, the amount of fertilizer accumulated has greatly increased, and the ability for field processing has greatly improved. New production conditions require new and more reasonable field management techniques. After organizing the masses for a large-scale debate, Liucun Village in Anguo County has already broken five old production habits such as drought seedlings and dwarfing seedlings, and promoted more than ten new management techniques such as early watering and skillful fertilization.
    Good objective conditions cannot play a significant role if people are not good at utilizing them. If the Party organization of Liucun Village had not mobilized farmers to break old rules and bad habits and implement new methods, then despite the good conditions of "sufficient water, abundant fertilizer, and ample labor" today, field management would still be the same as before, and crops would still not grow well. From this, it can be seen that only people who break superstitions and dare to think and act truly respect objective conditions. "Conditionists," in fact, are the least respectful of objective conditions. They simply lie with their eyes closed on old objective conditions that no longer exist to talk about objective conditions. They cannot see the changes that have occurred or will occur in objective conditions, and they cannot sufficiently recognize and exert human subjective initiative. They dare not break and dare not establish. In this way, they cannot use real conditions to achieve the achievements that could have been achieved.
    Objective conditions are constantly changing, and therefore the breaking and establishing will continue to take place. Today's production conditions such as water, fertilizer, and soil have been greatly improved compared to the era of the small-scale peasant economy, requiring the breaking of old farming habits and the implementation of new production technologies and farming methods; with the development of water conservancy construction, soil improvement, and fertilizer accumulation and production movements, even better production conditions will emerge, requiring corresponding changes in production technology and the addition of new measures to increase production. And each of these two aspects of change will promote a new leap forward in agricultural production.

    要不断地破和立
    程浦
    农业合作化以后，农业生产技术和耕作方法就开始了一个破和立的过程：破产生于个体经济条件下的落后的生产习惯和耕作方法，立适于大生产条件的能够加快增产速度的生产技术和耕作方法。在农业大跃进中，新的生产技术正在日益广大的范围内代替陈旧的生产技术，先进的增产措施正在为越来越多的人所掌握和运用。但是，破和立的过程并没有完结。因为即使在先进的地区，个体经营时期残留下来的陈规陋习仍然还有一定的约束力，为了给农业生产的跃进扫清障碍，需要继续破旧立新，才能把一套新的适于大生产条件的耕作制度建立起来。从这个意义上看，河北省安国县流村党组织领导农民在夏季田间管理中大破陈旧经验的做法，是很值得重视的。
    破除旧的耕作方法和生产习惯的关键，在于使群众充分认识大跃进以来生产条件的巨大变化，破除迷信，敢想敢干。安国县流村农民中曾经流行过的“五月旱吃饱饭”、“肥大烧苗”等等旧时的生产经验，这些都反映了个体经营时期缺水缺肥缺劳力的条件下农民对于田间管理无能为力的状况。今天的生产条件完全变了：水利灌溉能力大大提高了，积肥数量大大增加了，田间加工的能力大为提高了。新的生产条件要求有新的更合理的田间管理技术。安国县流村在组织群众大辩论之后，就已经破除了旱苗、蹲苗等五项陈旧的生产习惯，推行了早浇水、巧施肥等十几项新的管理技术。
    好的客观条件如果人们不善于利用，也还是不能发挥大作用。假若流村的党组织不去发动农民，破除陈规陋习，实行新办法，那么，尽管今天有“水足、肥大、工多”的好条件，田间管理还将是老样子，庄稼还是长不好。由此看来，只有破除了迷信，敢想敢干的人们，才是真正尊重客观条件的。“唯条件论者”，其实是最不尊重客观条件，他们只是闭着眼睛躺在早已不存在了的旧的客观条件上谈客观条件，看不见客观条件已经发生或将要发生的变化，他们更不能足够地认识和发挥人的主观能动性，不敢破也不敢立，这样，他们就不能运用真正的条件去取得本来可能取得的成就。
    客观条件是不断变化着的，因而破和立也将不断地进行下去。今天的水、肥、土等生产条件比小农经济时代大大改善了，要求破除陈旧的耕作习惯，实行新的生产技术和耕作方法；随着水利建设、改良土壤和积肥造肥运动的发展，又会出现更好的生产条件，又要求相应地改变生产技术和增加新的增产措施。而这两方面的每一个变化，都将促进农业生产新的跃进。
