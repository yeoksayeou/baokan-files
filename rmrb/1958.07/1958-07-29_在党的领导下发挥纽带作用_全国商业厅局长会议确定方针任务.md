Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Commercial work must strive to implement the General Line. This is the principle and task defined by the National Conference of Heads of Commercial Bureaus, which closed today.

    In accordance with the spirit of the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the conference pointed out that the basic principles and tasks of commercial work in the future are: under the leadership of the Party, with politics in command, relying on the masses, cooperating with all parties, promoting production, expanding circulation, ensuring supply, operating diligently and frugally, increasing accumulation, and, while continuing to carry out and cooperate in completing the socialist transformation, actively carrying out the technical revolution and the cultural revolution, and striving to implement the General Line.
    The meeting emphasized that political and ideological work is always the soul and commander of commercial work. Commercial work must be carried out under the absolute leadership of the Party. Commercial work and commercial construction must be carried out in accordance with the instructions of the Party. Commercial departments at all levels should resolutely implement the resolutions of the Party committee at the same level and consciously revolve around the central work of the Party, combined with specific circumstances, to give play to the role of commerce.
    How should the production viewpoint of commercial departments be reflected during the period of socialist construction? The conference believes that commercial work is a bridge between production and production and between production and consumption. Under the illumination of the General Line, commercial departments mainly reflect the production viewpoint in the field of commodity circulation. Through purchasing and sales activities, close cooperation with industry and agriculture to promote the development of production is the greatest production viewpoint. However, due to China's backward economy and uneven development, commerce still needs to directly engage in some production for a certain period of time to supplement the inadequacy of industrial and agricultural production. Whether cooperating with industrial and agricultural production or running industry by itself, it is necessary to conform to the General Line's principle of "three simultaneous developments" (simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, simultaneous development of heavy and light industries, and simultaneous development of national and local industries).
    Commercial work has a wide range of contacts. The regulatory role of commerce should be fully utilized in many aspects, such as industry and commerce, agriculture and commerce, urban and rural areas, regions, domestic and foreign affairs, and within the commercial system itself. The meeting believes that the relationship between socialist commerce and all parties should be cooperation with all parties and embody the communist style. In this way, the development of socialist construction can be better promoted.
    The meeting also studied the dialectical unity relationship between production, circulation, and accumulation. Accumulation is the premise for expanding reproduction and continuously improving people's lives. The profits of socialist commerce are an important part of the capital accumulation for socialist economic construction. The basic method for socialist commerce to obtain profits and increase accumulation is to develop production, expand circulation, and mobilize the masses to run undertakings diligently and frugally. This requires commercial workers to have a comprehensive view of the accumulation problem, recognize the importance of socialist accumulation, distinguish the essential difference between the profits of socialist enterprises and the capitalist self-enrichment, and continuously improve business management, reduce costs, and increase accumulation for the country.
    What role should commercial departments play in the technical revolution and cultural revolution movements? The conference believes that the various materials needed for the technical and cultural revolutions should be supplied as much as possible; and the technical equipment needed should be helped to solve as much as possible. Various samples should be collected from home and abroad or trial-produced independently for identification, comparison, promotion, and introduction. Commercial workers should work hard to learn technology and become the best propagandists and technology promoters.
    The meeting emphasized that in the future, right-leaning conservative ideas should be continuously criticized, as well as those ideas that fear good harvests, fear increased production, that there is no way to handle the situation when the supply of things is reduced, that do not pay attention to investigation and research, and that do not recognize that the current procurement and supply work of commerce is extremely heavy.
    The meeting lasted fifteen days and was jointly convened by the First Ministry of Commerce and the Second Ministry of Commerce.

    在党的领导下发挥纽带作用
    全国商业厅局长会议确定方针任务
    据新华社28日讯　商业工作要为贯彻执行总路线而奋斗，这是今天闭幕的全国商业厅局长会议确定的方针任务。
    大会根据鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的精神，指出今后商业工作的基本方针与任务是：在党的领导下，以政治为统帅，依靠群众，协作各方，促进生产，扩大流通，保证供应，勤俭经营，增加积累，在继续进行和配合完成社会主义改造的同时，积极开展技术革命和文化革命，为贯彻执行总路线而奋斗。
    会议强调指出，政治思想工作永远是商业工作的灵魂和统帅。商业工作必须在党的绝对领导下去进行。必须遵照党的指示去进行商业工作和商业建设。各级商业部门应坚决地贯彻同级党委的决议，自觉地围绕着党的中心工作结合具体情况，去发挥商业作用。
    在社会主义建设时期，商业部门的生产观点应如何体现？会议认为，商业工作是生产与生产之间和生产与消费之间的桥梁，在总路线的灯塔照耀下，商业部门主要是在商品流通领域中来体现生产观点。通过购销活动，与工农业密切协作，促进生产的发展，这就是最大的生产观点。但是由于我国经济还落后，发展不平衡，商业在一定时期中还需要直接搞些生产，以补工农业生产的不足。在与工农业生产协作或自己办工业，都需要符合总路线“三个并举”的方针。
    商业工作的接触面很宽，工商、农商、城乡、地区、内外以及商业本系统之间许多方面，应当充分发挥商业的调节作用。会议认为社会主义商业与各方面的关系，应该是协作各方，体现共产主义的风格。这样，才能更好地促进社会主义建设事业的发展。
    会议还研究了生产、流通与积累三者辩证统一的关系。积累是扩大再生产，不断改善人民生活的前提。社会主义商业的利润是社会主义经济建设资金积累的一个重要部分。社会主义商业取得利润增加积累的基本办法，是从发展生产，扩大流通，发动群众勤俭办事业。这就要求商业工作人员对于积累问题有全面观点，认识社会主义积累的重要性，要区别社会主义企业的利润与资本主义的盈利自肥的不同本质，并且不断改善经营管理，降低费用，为国家增加积累。
    在技术革命和文化革命运动中，商业部门应发挥什么作用？会议认为，对技术和文化革命所需要的各种物资，尽量满足供应；对所需要的技术设备，尽量帮助解决。从国内外搜集或自行试制各种样品，进行鉴定、比较、推广和介绍。商业工作人员要努力学习技术，成为最好的宣传员和技术推广人员。
    会议强调今后应不断地批判右倾保守思想，批判那些丰收也怕、增产也怕、供应的东西少了没办法、不注意调查研究，没有认清目前商业的收购、供应工作异常繁重等思想。
    会议历时十五天，是由第一商业部和第二商业部联合召开的。
