Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, July 10th -- According to TASS Beirut on July 9th: "Al- تلغراف" published a statement from the Lebanese parties and groups representative meeting. The statement demanded that the Lebanese people pay attention to the danger of the meetings to be held by the Baghdad Pact member states in London and Turkey.

The statement pointed out that there are plans to directly or indirectly pull Lebanon into the Baghdad Pact. The statement said that imperialism established the Baghdad Pact in order to consolidate its rule and maintain its oil interests in the Arab East. Imperialism has not accepted the lessons of its disastrous defeat in Egypt, and has not given up its ambition to suppress the national liberation movement of the Arab people, and therefore has decided to use the Lebanese crisis to achieve this goal.

The statement called on the Lebanese people to crush this new conspiracy that endangers their independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 10th -- According to reports, from late night on the 8th to early morning on the 9th, the rebel people's forces in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, engaged in fierce fighting with the troops of the Chamoun government. The government forces used artillery and tanks. The fighting was particularly fierce in the areas around the Presidential Palace, the city center, Martyrs' Square, and the two streets of Basta and Tariq al-Jdideh.

At the same time, fighting also took place between the rebel people's forces and the government troops in Tripoli, Baalbek, Tyre, and Beqaa on the 9th. Damascus newspapers reported that the people's forces ambushed a company of Chamoun's troops on the Al-Baddawi road in Tripoli, killing seven soldiers and destroying the bridge connecting the Al-Baddawi area and Mankoubin area. Reports say that the rebel people's forces also ambushed Chamoun's troops in the Rifaiyah and Tartousi districts of Tripoli, killing twenty and wounding several others. On the same day, the rebel people's forces also attacked Chamoun's troops in the Suweika area and Dahmouger area of Tripoli, killing twenty-five people, and also attacked the suburbs of Tripoli, occupying the village of Tatour northeast of Tripoli.

Damascus newspapers reported on the 9th that Asad, the leader of the rebel people's forces in southern Lebanon, revealed that the Chamoun group is currently using 1,200 Iraqi troops to fight in the Chouf Mountains, and that Iraqi troops are also assisting in other areas.
