Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 21st: Some members of the United States Congress are increasingly concerned about the adventurous actions of the United States' armed intervention in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, and they believe that the proposal by Khrushchev to convene a summit of great powers to stop the flames of war in the Near and Middle East should not be rejected.

    Senator Morse said on the 20th that the U.S. State Department's policy toward Lebanon was "wrong" and lacked support. The United States should not send troops to interfere in the Lebanese civil war and support the shaky regime there.

    Morse also spoke in the Senate on the 17th, criticizing the U.S. government's policy of interfering in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, and advocating for the withdrawal of U.S. intervention troops from Lebanon and the replacement of Secretary of State Dulles. He said that due to the armed intervention of the United States, "we have fallen into a tragic situation." He was convinced that the U.S. position would not receive the necessary two-thirds support from representatives at the United Nations General Assembly.

    Morse said that the current U.S. course of action in the Arab East is linked to serious dangers. "First, there is the danger of a possible war with Russia." He added that the course of action we are following, in addition to the immoral colonialist and imperialist policies pursued by Britain, and the exploitation of the people of the Middle East for many generations, confirms the Soviet argument that we are most concerned about oil, not allowing people to have the right to establish their own form of governance.

    He continued: "The second danger we face is that we have not set a date for withdrawal from Lebanon. How do we plan to withdraw? When do we plan to withdraw? The longer we stay there, the more the Muslim world will hate us."

    Morse believed that the third danger was that the expansion of aggression in the Near East would cause the United States to "lose face." He said that many member states of the United Nations were at least somewhat cold towards the United States.

    Senator Mansfield, the Deputy Leader of the Democratic Party in the Senate, said on the 20th that he hoped Eisenhower would give "all possible consideration" to Khrushchev's proposal. "Given the current serious situation, I hope that the Soviet proposal will not be rejected without the most careful consideration." He said: Although the current specific problem is the Middle East issue, the world situation is also "very unreliable." "If there is any opportunity to reach a solution, no matter how small, I hope we will accept it." Mansfield also believed that, whatever the solution, the United States must recognize the rising tide of nationalism in the Middle East.

    Senator Dworshak said on the 20th that the U.S. Congress was "very uneasy" about the Eisenhower administration's intervention in the Middle East. He also said that Khrushchev's proposal raised "serious questions," and if the proposal was rejected, the United States could be criticized by the world.

    Senator Russell, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, although generally still supported the U.S. intervention in Lebanon, expressed concern in a speech on the 19th that "the situation created by the U.S. intervention in this Middle Eastern country will involve the United States in military action for a long time." He believed that sending U.S. troops to Lebanon was at least a risky gamble, a result of the U.S. foreign policy errors. He pointed out that if the United States attempts to support King Hussein of Jordan to succeed to the throne of Iraq, "this will inevitably cause conflict, and the United States will be involved in this conflict for a long time." Russell suggested that the East and West reach an agreement on the Near and Middle East issue.

    Senator Sparkman, referring to the U.S. government's proposal to send United Nations troops to Lebanon, was concerned that this proposal would not receive the necessary two-thirds support in the United Nations General Assembly.

    干涉中东使美国陷入悲惨境地
    美国一些议员批评政府中东政策
    新华社21日讯  华盛顿消息：美国一些国会议员对于美国武装干涉中东国家内政的冒险行动越来越感到忧虑，他们并且认为不应当拒绝赫鲁晓夫提出的召开大国首脑会议来制止中近东战火的建议。
    参议员莫尔斯20日说，美国国务院对黎巴嫩的政策是“错误”的，它得不到人们的支持。美国不应当派兵干涉黎巴嫩的内战，支持那里摇摇欲坠的政权。
    莫尔斯17日也曾经在参议院发言抨击美国政府干涉中东国家内政的政策，并且主张美国干涉军队撤出黎巴嫩和撤换国务卿杜勒斯。他说，由于美国的武装干涉，“我们已经陷入了悲惨的境地”。他确信，在联合国大会上美国的立场不会得到必需的三分之二的代表的支持。
    莫尔斯说，美国目前在阿拉伯东方行动的方针同严重的危险联结在一起。“首先，存在着同俄国可能发生战争的危险”。他又补充说，我们所遵循的行动方针除了英国所执行的不道德的殖民主义和帝国主义政策以外，还有过去许多代以来对中东人民的剥削，这就证实了苏联的论断，就是我们最关心的是石油，而不是让人民有自己建立自己的管理形式的权利。
    他接着说：“我们所碰到的第二个危险是我们在黎巴嫩没有确定退出的日期。我们打算怎样退出来呢？我们打算什么时候退出来？我们在那里停留得愈久，穆斯林世界对我们就愈仇恨”。
    莫尔斯认为第三个危险是近东侵略的扩大将会使美国“威信扫地”。他说，联合国的许多会员国对美国的态度起码是有点冷淡的。
    参议院民主党副领袖曼斯菲尔德20日说，他希望艾森豪威尔对赫鲁晓夫的建议给予“一切可能的考虑”，“鉴于目前的严重状况，我希望不要没有经过最仔细的考虑就拒绝苏联的建议”。他说：虽然目前的具体问题是中东问题，但是世界的状况也“很靠不住”，“如果有达成解决办法的任何机会，不管是多么微小，我希望我们都接受”。曼斯菲尔德并且曾经认为，不论是什么样的解决办法，美国都必须承认中东日益高涨的民族主义精神。
    参议员德沃夏克20日说，美国国会对于艾森豪威尔政府对中东的干涉“很不安”。他还说，赫鲁晓夫的建议提出了“严重的问题”，如果拒绝这个建议，美国就有可能遭到全世界的批评。
    参议院军事委员会主席鲁塞尔虽然总的说来仍然支持美国干涉黎巴嫩的行动，但是他在19日一次演说中担心“美国对这个中东国家进行干涉所造成的局面，将使美国长时期地卷入军事行动。”他认为往黎巴嫩派遣美国军队至少是一种很冒险的把戏，是美国外交政策错误的结果。他指出，如果美国企图扶植约旦国王侯赛因继任伊拉克的王位，“这必然会引起冲突，并且美国将很长时期地卷入这种冲突”。鲁塞尔建议东西方就中近东问题达成协议。
    参议员斯巴克曼在谈到美国政府主张的派联合国部队到黎巴嫩去的意见时担心这个意见在联合国大会上不可能得到必要的三分之二的票数的支持。
