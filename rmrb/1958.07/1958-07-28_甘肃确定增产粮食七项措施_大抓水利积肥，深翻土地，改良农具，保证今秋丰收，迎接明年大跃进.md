    Gansu Province Determines Seven Measures to Increase Grain Production
    Vigorously Develop Water Conservancy, Accumulate Fertilizer, Deep Plow Land, Improve Farm Tools, Ensure a Bumper Harvest This Autumn, and Welcome the Great Leap Forward Next Year
    (Our report) The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a joint meeting of prefectural and county party secretaries in Linxia City to study measures to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn crops this year and to welcome a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year.
    The meeting held that various tasks in the rural areas of Gansu are undergoing a comprehensive great leap forward. The most fundamental force driving the great leap forward in various tasks is that the vast majority of townships and communes have conscientiously implemented the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In terms of production, according to forecasts from various regions, the average wheat yield per mu in the province can reach more than 290 jin, and the label of low wheat yield can be removed. Autumn crops are growing well. If no major disasters are encountered, the total grain output this year can be doubled compared with last year, which means the call for an average of 1,200 jin of grain per person can be realized.
    In order to ensure a bumper harvest of autumn crops this year and to welcome a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year, the meeting proposed that it is necessary to highlight grain, the marshal, and all rural work must be centered on increasing grain production. Based on the experience of various regions, the meeting proposed seven important measures to ensure increased grain production, namely water conservancy, fertilizer, soil improvement, popularization of improved varieties, rational close planting, field management, and improvement of farm tools, with water, fertilizer, soil, and farm tool improvement being the most important. In terms of water conservancy, by the end of this year, it is necessary to ensure that more than 25 million mu are actually irrigated, and another 15 million mu will be built next year. The main problems at present are, first, to build a large number of reservoirs to store water and actively develop underground water sources; second, to repair and line channels, overcome seepage, and improve irrigation facilities to increase irrigation efficiency, striving for 100,000 mu of land irrigated per cubic meter of water per second. In terms of soil and water conservation, the "Dengjiabao" movement should be continued. A large number of terraced fields should be built to gradually realize the transformation of gullies into flat land, and gentle slopes into terraced fields, in preparation for mechanized farming. In terms of increasing fertilizer application: it is necessary to accumulate a large amount of manure, smoked fertilizer, ash fertilizer, bacterial fertilizer, and peat. At present, it is necessary to seize the time to compost fertilizer. We must actively promote the three changes and three creations of fertilizer, that is, changing low efficiency to high efficiency, changing slow effect to fast effect, and changing small quantity to large quantity. It is also necessary to produce a large amount of local chemical fertilizer, requiring 50 to 100 jin of local chemical fertilizer per mu for autumn crops this year, and 100 to 200 jin next year. In terms of soil improvement, the meeting required deep plowing of 40 million mu this autumn and next spring, with a depth of one chi to one chi and five cun. For this reason, it is necessary to emphasize mobilizing the masses to rush to make and create tools for deep plowing. The meeting also required improving labor organization and tapping labor potential.
    The meeting emphasized that future grain production will still focus on increasing yield per mu, so it is necessary to ensure the implementation of the above basic measures.

    甘肃确定增产粮食七项措施
    大抓水利积肥，深翻土地，改良农具，保证今秋丰收，迎接明年大跃进
    本报讯　中共甘肃省委最近在临夏市召开地委书记、县委书记联席会议，研究争取今年秋田大丰收和迎接明年农业生产更大跃进的措施。
    会议认为，甘肃农村各项工作正在全面大跃进，推动各项工作大跃进的最基本力量，是农村绝大部分的乡社认真地贯彻执行了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。在生产方面，据各地预测全省小麦亩产可以达到二百九十余斤，小麦低产的帽子可以摘去。秋田作物生长良好，如果不再遇到特大灾害，今年粮食总产量将可比去年翻一番，即可实现每人平均一千二百斤粮食的号召。
    为了保证今年秋田的大丰收和迎接明年农业生产的更大跃进，会议提出必须突出地抓粮食这个元帅，农村各项工作都必须以增产粮食为中心。保证粮食增产的重要措施，依据各地经验提出了七项，即水利、肥料、改良土壤、普及良种、合理密植、田间管理和改良农具，而以水、肥、土、农具改良最关重要。在水利方面，今年年底必须确保实灌两千五百万亩以上，明年还要再兴修一千五百万亩。当前的主要问题，首先是大量修库蓄水，积极开发地下水源；其次是补砌渠道，克服渗漏，改进灌溉设施，提高灌溉效率，争取每秒公方水灌地十万亩。水土保持方面，要继续开展“邓家堡”运动。大量修梯田，逐步实现沟地川台化、缓坡梯田化，为机耕作好准备。增施肥料方面：要大量积攒粪肥、熏肥、灰肥、菌肥、泥炭，目前要抓紧沤肥。要积极推广肥料的三改三造，即改低效为高效、改迟效为速效、改小量为大量。还要大量制造土化肥，要求今年秋田每亩施土化肥五十到一百斤，明年一百到二百斤，改良土壤方面，会议要求今秋明春深翻四千万亩，深度一尺到一尺五寸。为此必须强调动员群众赶制和创造深翻地的工具。会议还要求改进劳动组织，挖掘劳动潜力。
    会议强调指出：今后粮食增产仍然以提高亩产量为主，因此必须保证上述基本措施的贯彻执行。
