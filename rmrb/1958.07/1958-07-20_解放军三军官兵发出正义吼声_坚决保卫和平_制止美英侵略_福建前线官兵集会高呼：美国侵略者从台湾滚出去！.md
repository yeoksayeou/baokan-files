The People's Liberation Army's Three Services Issue Righteous Roars
Resolutely Defending Peace and Stopping US-British Aggression
Fujian Frontline Officers and Soldiers Gathered and Shouted: American Aggressors Get Out of Taiwan!

(Our Newspaper) The heinous actions of US-British imperialism in armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan have aroused the immense anger of the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Beijing Military Region. On the afternoon of July 18, over 1,700 personnel from various organs and units stationed in the capital held meetings to express their firm support for the Chinese government's statement, their full support for the just struggle of the Arab people, and to demand that the US-British invading troops get out of the Middle East.

At the meeting, many comrades, with boundless anger, condemned and protested the arrogant and shameless acts of aggression by US-British imperialism. Yuan Shengping, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Beijing Military Region, reported to the comrades present on the current situation in the Middle East, exposed the imperialist plot to invade the Middle East, and expressed full support for the just struggle of the Arab people.

The enraged masses, like an erupting volcano, were unstoppable and took to the stage to speak. Zhao Ronglin, representative of the Beijing Military Region Headquarters, said passionately: We are the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the defenders of peace. We fully support the national independence movement and the just struggle for freedom of the Lebanese people. We will not allow warmongers to undermine peace, nor will we allow the US-British imperialist conspiracy to succeed. Zhang Zhizhong, a lieutenant from the Logistics Oil Department, said angrily at the meeting: When we heard that the claws of US-British imperialism had reached out to the Arab people, and that they had launched an armed invasion of Lebanon and Jordan, our hearts boiled like molten steel. We are soldiers of the people, and we bear the responsibility of defending world peace. We will never allow imperialism to run amok. US-British imperialism's attempt to conquer the Arab people by force is a dream. Butcher knives have never conquered righteous people.

The comrades present eagerly signed their names on a huge protest banner that read, "US-British Aggressor Troops Get Out of the Middle East!"

Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: In recent days, officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force stationed in Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Shenyang, Dalian, and other regions have held meetings and parades, angrily denouncing the aggressive crimes of US-British imperialism and expressing their determination to support the just struggle of the Arab people. They have also written a large number of joint protest letters. Battalion Commander Chen Shuzhen, who volunteered to participate in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, said: US imperialism has long been a defeated foe of the Chinese people, and Britain is even less of a threat. In the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people, with inferior equipment, defeated the American bandits. Today, if the US-British invading troops do not get out of Lebanon and Jordan, the result will be a more disgraceful defeat than the invasions of Korea and Egypt. Ma Fengge, the chief engineer of a torpedo boat who participated in the sinking of the US-made Chiang Kai-shek's "Taiping" warship, said, "We are the defenders of peace. If anyone undermines world peace, we will wage a resolute struggle against the aggressors." Air Force combat hero Han Decai, who participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, recounted his deeds of shooting down five US aircraft on the Korean battlefield, saying, "I was only twenty years old at the time, and my combat skills were not high, but my determination and will to defend the motherland and defend peace gave me infinite strength." He expressed his readiness to contribute his strength to defending world peace at any time.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 18th: The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou held meetings and discussions on the 17th to protest the armed aggression of US and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan.

Colonel Zhu Daqing, who participated in the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, said: The armed aggression of US and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan is simply intolerable. We firmly support the just struggle of the Iraqi and Lebanese people, and we firmly demand that US and British imperialism immediately stop its aggression and withdraw its invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan!

Private Liu Zaiqi of a certain unit, in his speech, expressed his determination to heighten vigilance, hold the gun tightly in his hand, strengthen training, and resolutely defend the motherland, defend Asia, and defend world peace.

Many officers and soldiers also wrote letters to newspapers, expressing their support for the just struggle of the Iraqi and Lebanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline, July 19th: Over the past two days, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the three services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Frontline have held meetings, severely condemning the aggressive actions of US-British imperialism in the Middle East and demanding that the US and British aggressor troops immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan.

The news that US and British invading troops had successively invaded Lebanon and Jordan aroused great anger among the officers and soldiers of the three services on the Fujian Frontline. Many officers in various organs and units formed "Anti-Aggression, Defend Peace" propaganda teams to carry out extensive propaganda to soldiers and residents of the area. Various units also held military meetings and forums to expose the aggressive crimes of the US and British imperialists. Officers and soldiers of a certain unit, who had made outstanding achievements in the war to liberate the motherland, held a meeting in the rain yesterday, expressing their firm support for the just struggle of the Arab people and unanimously denouncing the aggressive crimes of US imperialism. At a mass rally of a certain unit in the Xiamen area, Lieutenant Song Jiahe said that imperialism is not to be feared, and victory ultimately belongs to the righteous people. The aggressive actions of US and British invading troops in the Middle East are bound to suffer a shameful defeat. Yin Hesheng, deputy regimental commander and combat hero of a certain unit that is helping the people of Fujian build the Baita Hydropower Station, said that we resolutely protest US aggression against Lebanon and resolutely protest US occupation of our territory Taiwan. He shouted: "American aggressor troops get out of Lebanon immediately! Get out of our Taiwan!
