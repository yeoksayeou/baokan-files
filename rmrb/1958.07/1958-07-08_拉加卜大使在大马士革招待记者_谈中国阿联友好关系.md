Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 7th: The Ambassador of the United Arab Republic to China, Hassan Ragab, stated to news reporters in Damascus on the 6th that "recognizing China has become the standard for measuring whether a country has broken free from foreign influence."

Ragab arrived in Damascus on the 5th to study how to unify the agreements that China had previously signed separately with the two parts of the United Arab Republic (Egypt and Syria). He said that the agreements concluded between the United Arab Republic and China are being implemented well.

He said that when Egypt was invaded by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, People's China was the first country to help Egypt materially and morally. When the situation on the border between Syria and Turkey deteriorated, the Chinese people expressed the same willingness to act and desire to provide assistance.

He also said, "Our Chinese brothers regard the union of Egypt and Syria as an important factor leading to the realization of peace in the Middle East."

He also believes that China will soon occupy its rightful place in world affairs.

    拉加卜大使在大马士革招待记者
    谈中国阿联友好关系
    新华社大马士革7日电  阿拉伯联合共和国驻中国大使哈桑·拉加卜在6日对大马士革新闻记者发表谈话说，“承认中国已经成为衡量一个国家是否摆脱了外国影响的标准”。
    拉加卜在5日到大马士革来研究如何把中国曾经同阿拉伯联合共和国的两个部分（埃及和叙利亚）分别签订的协定统一起来的问题。他说，阿拉伯联合共和国同中国缔结的协定正在履行得很好。
    他说，人民中国是在埃及受到英、法、以三国侵略的时候首先在物质上和道义上帮助埃及的国家。当叙利亚和土耳其的边境局势恶化的时候，中国人民表示了同样的准备行动的态度和给予帮助的愿望。
    他还说，“我们的中国兄弟把埃及和叙利亚的联合看作是导致实现中东和平的一个重要因素。”
    他还认为，中国很快就会在世界事务中占有它应占有的地位。
