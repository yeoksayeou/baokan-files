Collective Childcare, Establishment of Public Canteens, Sewing Machines for Clothing, Electric and Stone Mills for Grains
    Women's Labor Force Greatly Liberated in the Suburbs of the Capital
    320,000 Women Participating in Production Labor, Efficiency Doubled

    (Our dispatch) Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the broad masses of rural women in the suburbs of Beijing are exerting their utmost efforts, advancing shoulder to shoulder with the men. Throughout the suburbs, 320,000 women laborers have participated in production and various rural construction undertakings, and labor productivity has generally increased, with the labor efficiency of many women more than doubling.

    To meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, a "Four-izations" movement aimed at liberating women's labor and developing production is being widely carried out in rural areas of the suburbs. The "Four-izations" are: collectivization of childcare, canteenization of cooking, mechanization of sewing, and mechanization of grain processing. According to incomplete statistics, in the area of collective childcare, more than 130,000 children under the age of seven throughout the suburbs have entered childcare schools, kindergartens, and nurseries (groups), enabling more than 67,000 mothers to be freed from the burden of children and participate in production. Thirty-seven of the more than 180 townships in the suburbs have basically achieved the collectivization of childcare. In terms of canteenization of cooking, 1,849 canteens have been established throughout the suburbs, generally run by production teams. In terms of mechanization of sewing, more than 700 sewing groups and 29 clothing factories have been organized throughout the suburbs, with more than 2,100 sewing machines, replacing the tedious labor of women's hand sewing. A total of 246 milling groups have been organized throughout the suburbs, with more than 500 electric and stone mills processing grain for the peasants.

    In areas where the "Four-izations" have been fully or partially implemented, a new situation has emerged in rural production. After Shunyi District realized the mechanization of sewing and the canteenization of cooking, it is estimated that approximately 30 million workdays can be saved annually for production. Before the "Four-izations" were implemented in Beidundai Village, Beidundai Township, Daxing District, only 75 of the 194 female laborers in the village participated in agricultural production; after the "Four-izations" were implemented, all the female laborers participated in production. Freed from household chores and childcare, the women spontaneously formed two women's battalions and seven women's companies. Led by the women's battalion commander, they went to the fields as early as 4 a.m. every day to fight drought, plant seeds, and transplant rice seedlings. One battalion of 70 women completed the task of carrying water to plant 40 mu of sweet potatoes in just two hours. They composed such doggerel to express their cheerful mood: "Now women's liberation is thorough, from now on, no need for every household to cook and sew, this time fighting drought, planting seeds and transplanting rice seedlings, determined to compete with men." In Songzhuang Township, Tongzhou District, half of the original 3,500 women participating in production used to arrive late and leave early every day due to the burden of children and household chores, only working half a day and putting in half a month's work per month. After the "Four-izations" were implemented, the number of attendees increased to 4,736, with each person working more than 28 days per month and 11 hours per day. Moreover, the women's production enthusiasm is extremely high. The township organized four Mu Guiying teams with 203 women participating, and 50% of the shock troops in the township are women. More than half of the task of summer planting of 8,756 mu was completed by women.

    The "Four-izations" not only promoted production but also changed the face of rural life, bringing a happy life to the broad masses of women. Before the "Four-izations" were implemented, there were conflicts between women's participation in production, household chores, and childcare. Many women worked in the fields during the day, and after work, they were busy cooking, sewing, and grinding grain, often working until late at night. Those without elderly people at home also had difficulties taking care of their children; some children ran around and made trouble because they were not taken care of, and they did not receive a good education. Mothers could not get a good rest, nor could they concentrate on production labor. Now, women can not only participate in production with a cheerful mood, but also participate in cultural studies and social activities.

### 集体教养儿童  兴办公共食堂  缝纫机器做衣被  电磨立磨磨粮食  首都郊区妇女劳动力大解放  三十二万名妇女参加生产劳动效率提高一倍

    集体教养儿童  兴办公共食堂  缝纫机器做衣被  电磨立磨磨粮食
    首都郊区妇女劳动力大解放
    三十二万名妇女参加生产劳动效率提高一倍
    本报讯  在总路线灯塔的光辉照耀下，北京郊区广大农村妇女正在鼓足干劲和男子并肩前进。全郊区已经有三十二万名妇女劳动力参加了生产和农村各项建设事业，而且劳动生产率普遍提高，许多妇女的劳动效率提高了一倍以上。
    为了适应工农业生产大跃进的需要，一个以解放妇女劳动力、发展生产为目的的“四化”运动，正在郊区农村广泛开展。“四化”就是：儿童教养集体化，做饭食堂化，缝纫机器化，粮食加工机磨化。据不完全的统计：在儿童教养集体化方面，全郊区已经有十三万多个七岁以下的幼儿进入了幼儿学校、幼儿园和托儿所（组）等组织，使六万七千多个妈妈摆脱了孩子的牵累参加了生产。郊区一百八十多个乡中已经有三十七个乡基本上实现了儿童教养集体化。在做饭食堂化方面，全郊区已办了一千八百四十九个食堂，一般都是以生产队为单位兴办的。在缝纫机器化方面，全郊区已经组织起七百多个缝纫组和二十九个被服厂，有二千一百多部缝纫机，代替了妇女一针一线的繁琐劳动。全郊区共组织了二百四十六个磨面组，有五百多台电磨和立磨为农民加工粮食。
    凡是全部或部分实现了“四化”的地区，农村生产都出现了崭新的局面。顺义区实现了缝纫机器化和做饭食堂化后，据估算全年约可节省三千万个工投入生产。大兴区北顿岱乡北顿岱村在实现“四化”以前，全村一百九十四名女劳动力只有七十五人参加农业生产；实现“四化”以后，妇女劳动力全都参加了生产，妇女们摆脱了家务和孩子的牵累，自动地组成了两个妇女营、七个妇女连。每天由女营长带领，早上四点钟就下地抗旱点种和插秧。一营七十名妇女只花了两个钟头就完成担水栽白薯四十亩的任务。她们编出了这样的顺口溜，来表达舒畅的心情：“现在妇女翻身才彻底，今后不用家家作饭和缝衣，这次抗旱点种和插秧，决心要和男人比高低”。通州区宋庄乡原来参加生产的三千五百个妇女中，有一半妇女因孩子和家务牵累，每天晚去早归，一天只能干半天活，一月只能出半月工。实现“四化”以后，出勤人数增加到四千七百三十六名，每人每月出勤二十八天以上，每天都干十一小时的活。而且妇女生产情绪极为高涨，全乡组织了四个有二百零三名妇女参加的穆桂英队，全乡的突击队员中有50％是妇女，夏播八千七百五十六亩的任务，有一半以上的活是妇女完成的。
    “四化”不但促进了生产，还改变着农村的生活面貌，给广大妇女带来了幸福的生活。“四化”实现前，妇女参加生产和家务劳动，教养孩子发生矛盾，许多妇女白天下地干活，歇工后就忙着作饭、作针线活和推碾，经常忙到深更半夜，家里没有老人的，照顾孩子也发生困难；有些小孩因为没有大人照看，到处乱跑乱闹，得不到很好的教育，做妈妈的既得不到很好的休息，也不能安心生产劳动。现在，妇女们不但能心情舒畅地参加生产，而且还可以参加文化学习和社会活动了。
