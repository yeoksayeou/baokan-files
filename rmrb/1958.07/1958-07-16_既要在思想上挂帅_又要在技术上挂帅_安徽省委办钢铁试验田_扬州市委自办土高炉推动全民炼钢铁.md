    Not Only Must Ideology Be in Command, But Also Technology
    The Anhui Provincial Party Committee's Steel Experimental Plot
    The Yangzhou Municipal Party Committee's Self-Managed Indigenous Blast Furnaces Promote Nationwide Steelmaking

    Hefei, July 15th (by our reporter Yu Feng) - The Anhui Provincial Party Committee's steel joint factory, serving as the steel experimental plot for the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, has commenced construction in Hefei. This steel factory was proposed by Zeng Xisheng, the First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, to be built using Party membership dues, and it is a red flag in the movement of the entire Party and all the people of Anhui Province to vigorously develop the steel industry.

    The Provincial Party Committee leaders have participated in studying issues such as the factory's scale, design, and economical use of funds. The Provincial Party Committee originally planned to build four 1.5-cubic-meter small blast furnaces using indigenous methods. Recently, based on the experience of the provincial on-site conference on small blast furnace steelmaking – that building larger blast furnaces in cities is more economical due to the advantages of fully utilizing power equipment – it was decided to build blast furnaces of 13 to 28 cubic meters. When discussing the factory's scale, the Provincial Party Committee leaders believed that only refining iron without refining steel or rolling steel would not allow for gaining a relatively complete experience in leading the steel industry from the experimental plot. Therefore, it was decided to build a steel joint factory with an annual output of 120,000 tons of iron, 100,000 tons of steel, and 80,000 tons of steel products. This year, six 13 to 28 cubic meter blast furnaces, two 3-ton steel converters, a steel rolling workshop, and a machine repair workshop will be built first. Next year, four 28 to 55 cubic meter blast furnaces and one 3-ton steel converter will be built. After the decision to build the factory, the Provincial Party Committee immediately transferred dozens of cadres to carry out preparatory work. In the spirit of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results, the factory is being built using the method of simultaneous preparation, design, material preparation, construction, and cadre training. Currently, two 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces have commenced construction and will be completed in late July, producing iron in early August. The other blast furnaces will be completed in September, and the converters will also be completed by the end of September, producing steel in early October. The factory also aims to reduce the planned investment by 20% to 30% to set an example of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. Except for the main factory buildings, all non-production buildings will be built according to the lowest standards for urban housing construction. Many civil engineering projects will be organized for cadres of the Provincial Party Committee to participate in voluntary labor.

    Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, departments directly under the province, including industry and transportation, finance and trade, agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, political and legal affairs, culture and education, as well as the military region and universities, are actively preparing to build small steel joint factories; some have already started construction. The steel joint factory of the industrial and transportation department is an experimental plot for various blast furnaces in the province, including indigenous blast furnaces with people pulling bellows, small indigenous-foreign integrated blast furnaces using small power blowing equipment, and foreign blast furnaces.

    Nanjing, July 15th (by our reporter Zhang Jing) - The indigenous blast furnace in Yangzhou, personally managed by the Municipal Party Committee led by the Municipal Party Secretary, as an experimental plot, has produced good iron in every furnace. Through this experimental furnace, the Municipal Party Committee has been at the forefront of the movement to develop the steel industry by all the people, taking the lead in both ideology and technology from the very beginning.

    This experimental furnace was built in the backyard of the Municipal Party Committee office. During the construction process, all four secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee went to the site to participate in research, with the Minister of Industry and some office cadres and support staff specifically responsible for the operation. After six days and nights of hard work, iron began to be produced on July 1st. The first furnace successfully produced more than one hundred catties, and now more than three hundred kilograms of pig iron have been produced.

    After the Municipal Party Committee's indigenous blast furnace produced iron, it organized all units in the city to visit the site, accelerating the speed of the national steel industry campaign. Handicraft cooperatives, schools, hospitals, and street residents, who were originally skeptical and hesitant about indigenous steelmaking, have taken active action after returning. In less than ten days, various indigenous blast furnaces have sprung up all over the city. Currently, seventy blast furnaces have been built and put into production, and more than two hundred and sixty indigenous blast furnaces are under construction.

    The Municipal Party Committee's self-managed indigenous blast furnace not only inspired the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses in the city to develop the steel industry but also accumulated technical experience, which facilitated the Municipal Party Committee to carry out timely technical leadership. Currently, more than two hundred and fifty indigenous blast furnaces under construction in the city are basically built according to the principles of the Municipal Party Committee's indigenous blast furnace. The several secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee, having personally observed the furnace construction and iron production process, have initially grasped the basic knowledge of the structure, principles, and indigenous steelmaking methods of indigenous blast furnaces through practice. Now, when they go to the grassroots level, they can jointly study some technical issues related to ironmaking with the grassroots units.

    Recently, the Municipal Party Committee discovered that many indigenous blast furnaces that had been put into production could not produce iron continuously and broke down after only two or three furnaces. In order to take a step forward in technical guidance, the Municipal Party Committee dismantled the experimental furnace for dissection and research. Now, based on the results of the dissection, the Municipal Party Committee has absorbed the advantages of various indigenous blast furnaces in other units and summarized several basic experiences, which are being promoted throughout the city. At the same time, it has rebuilt a better-quality indigenous blast furnace, preparing to further accumulate experience and improve ironmaking technology in the trial refining process. The goal of the Municipal Party Committee is to enable all the more than three hundred blast furnaces that have been built and are about to be built in the city to continuously produce molten iron, striving to produce 20,000 tons of iron within two months.

    既要在思想上挂帅　又要在技术上挂帅
    安徽省委办钢铁试验田
    扬州市委自办土高炉推动全民炼钢铁
    本报合肥15日电　记者于风报道：作为中共安徽省委钢铁试验田的安徽省委机关的钢铁联合厂，已在合肥动工兴建。这个钢铁厂是省委第一书记曾希圣提议用党费兴建的，是安徽省全党全民大办钢铁工业运动中的一面红旗。
    这个厂的规模、设计和节约使用资金等问题，省委负责同志都参加进行了研究。省委机关本来计划用土法兴建四个一点五立方公尺的小型高炉，最近根据全省小高炉炼铁现场会议的经验——在城市建高炉，以充分利用动力设备等优越条件，建设较大的高炉比较经济，又确定建设十三到二十八立方公尺的高炉。在讨论工厂规模时，省委负责同志认为只炼铁不炼钢，不轧钢，便不能从试验田中取得领导钢铁工业的比较完整的经验，于是决定兴建一个年产十二万吨铁，十万吨钢，八万吨钢材的钢铁联合厂。今年先建设六个十三到二十八立方公尺的高炉，两个三吨炼钢转炉，一个轧钢车间和一个机修车间，明年再建设四个二十八到五十五立方公尺的高炉和一个三吨炼钢转炉。决定建厂以后，省委机关立即抽调了几十名干部进行筹备工作，这个厂本着多快好省的精神，用边筹备、边设计、边准备材料、边施工、边培训干部的办法兴建。现在已经有两个十三立方公尺的高炉动工兴建，将于7月下旬建成，8月初出铁；其他高炉将在9月份建好，转炉也要在9月底建成，10月初出钢。这个厂还要把计划投资减少20％到30％，以便树立勤俭办企业的榜样。除主厂房以外，一切非生产性建筑都将按照城市房屋建设的最低标准兴建。许多土建工程将组织省委机关干部参加义务劳动。
    在省委的带动下，省直属机关工业交通、财经贸易、农林水利、政法、文教等部门和军区、大学都在积极筹建小型钢铁联合厂；有的已经动工兴建。工业交通部门的钢铁联合厂是全省各种高炉的试验田，有人拉风箱的土高炉，有使用小型动力鼓风设备的土洋结合的小高炉，还有洋高炉。
    本报南京15日电　记者张竞报道：中共扬州市委由市委书记带头自办的试验田性质的土高炉，炉炉都炼出了好铁。通过这个试验炉，市委在领导全民大办钢铁工业的运动中，一开始就走在最前面，在思想上、技术上同时挂了帅。
    这座试验炉建在市委机关的后院里。修建过程中，市委四个书记都到现场参加研究，工业部长和部分机关干部、勤杂人员具体负责操作。经过六昼夜的苦战，在7月1日开始出铁。第一炉就顺利地炼出了一百多斤，现在已炼出生铁三百多公斤。
    市委在这座土高炉出铁以后，组织全市各单位到现场参观，加快了全民办钢铁工业的速度。本来对土法炼铁抱怀疑观望态度的手工业社、学校、医院和街道居民，回去以后都积极行动起来。不到十天功夫，各种土高炉就在全市遍地开花。现在已有七十个高炉建成投入生产，有二百六十多个土高炉正在兴建。
    市委自办土高炉不仅鼓舞了全市干部、群众办钢铁工业的积极性，还积累了技术经验，便于市委及时进行技术领导。现在，全市正在兴建的二百五十多个土高炉，基本上是按照市委机关土高炉的原理建造的。市委几个书记由于亲自观察了建炉和出铁的过程，从实践中初步摸到了有关土高炉的结构、原理和土法炼铁的基础知识，现在到基层去，就能同基层单位共同研究炼铁技术方面的一些问题了。
    最近，市委又发现已经投入生产的许多土高炉不能持久出铁，炼不到两、三炉就坏了。市委为了在技术指导上走前一步，又把试验炉拆开，进行了解剖研究。现在，市委已经根据解剖的结果，吸收其他单位各种土高炉的优点，归纳成了几条基本经验，在全市推广。同时又重新建造了一座质量更好的土高炉，准备进一步在试炼过程中积累经验，提高炼铁技术。市委的目标是：要使全市已经建成和即将建成的三百多座高炉都能源源不断地吐出铁水，争取在两个月内炼出二万吨铁。
