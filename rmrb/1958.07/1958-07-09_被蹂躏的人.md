A Free World, Indeed

The Oppressed People

For a long time, the Australian Communist Party's newspaper, "Tribune," has continuously exposed the truth about the Australian authorities' abuse and killing of Aboriginal residents. Aboriginal residents imprisoned in police stations are chained and subjected to treatment worse than that of cattle and horses. However, the Australian authorities have consistently denied the facts presented by the "Tribune."

Recently, Australian writer Greyton published a book accusing racism of its crimes: "Adam and the Atom." The author wrote that an Aboriginal resident named Barty, who was lame, in order to escape the abuse of white immigrants, disregarded his difficulty in walking and fled his residence alone, crossing the great desert of central Australia, hoping to find a way to survive elsewhere.

The author also said that the police chief of a place in Western Australia was also forced to admit the fact that Aboriginal residents were cruelly persecuted.

The "Tribune" reported on March 6 on a conversation with Grover, president of the Aboriginal-Australian Friendship Association. Grover said at the Aboriginal Congress: "Not long ago, Australians celebrated National Day. But for Aboriginal residents, it was a day of grief. Due to the terrible consequences of forcibly implementing Western methods on Aboriginal residents, the originally estimated 250,000 to 350,000 Aboriginal residents have been reduced to 46,000 according to the most recent census."

Australian Aboriginals are the earliest inhabitants of the Australian continent. They originally lived scattered throughout the Australian continent, living by hunting and farming. Since British navigators explored the Australian coast in the eighteenth century, white immigrants have gradually increased. They seized the land of the Aboriginal residents and drove them to the barren desert areas. Australian Aboriginals lost their land, and the rabbits and kangaroos that served as food have also become increasingly scarce due to daily hunting. Due to lack of food and water, Aboriginal residents face the fate of extinction.

A small number of Aboriginal residents who enter the big cities cannot obtain citizenship, and racial discrimination makes it difficult for them to make a living. The fate of these few Aboriginal residents can be seen from an obituary in a bulletin from the Australian government's so-called "Aboriginal Welfare Department." The deceased was a respected Aboriginal resident. The obituary said:

"With his death, the bloodline of Bent Bridge's family is broken.
He was a popular person. Children often teased him because of his good nature. His home became the children's home. He stubbornly maintained the customs of the Aboriginal tribes - always smiling, treating people generously and sincerely, and being inexplicably poor."

    被蹂躏的人
    长期以来，澳大利亚共产党机关报“论坛报”不断地揭发澳大利亚当局虐杀土著居民的实况。囚禁在警察局的土著居民被加上了锁链，受着牛马不如的待遇。但是，澳大利亚当局一直矢口否认“论坛报”所提出的事实。
    最近，澳大利亚作家格雷顿出版了一本控诉种族主义的罪恶的书籍：“亚当与原子”。作者写道，一个名叫巴狄的跛脚土著居民，为了挣脱白种移民的虐待，竟不顾行走艰难，独自逃离居地，爬过澳大利亚中部的大沙漠，希望到他处去找生路。
    作者还说，澳大利亚西部一个地方的警察负责人也被迫承认了对土著居民进行残酷迫害的事实。
    “论坛报”3月6日报道了土著居民—澳大利亚人友好协会会长格鲁弗的谈话。格鲁弗在土著居民大会上说：“不久以前，澳大利亚人庆祝了国庆日。但是对土著居民说来，那是一个哀痛的日子。由于对土著居民强迫实施西方办法的恶劣结果，原来估计的二十五万至三十五万名土著居民，根据最近一次人口调查，已经减少到四万六千名。”
    澳大利亚土著居民是澳洲大陆最早的居民。他们本来散居澳洲大陆各地，过着狩猎和耕牧生活。自从十八世纪英国航海家探察澳洲海岸以后，白种移民陆续增加。他们夺去了土著居民的土地，把土著居民赶到贫硗的沙漠地区。澳大利亚土著居民失去了土地，而作为食物的野兔与袋鼠，也因为逐日猎食而日见稀少。由于缺食缺水，土著居民面临着灭种的命运。
    进入大城市的少数土著居民，不能取得公民资格，种族歧视使他们谋生困难。从澳大利亚政府的所谓“土著居民福利部”公报上一则讣告里，看得出这些少数土著居民的命运。死者是一位受人敬重的土著居民。讣告说：
    “随着他的死，本特·布里奇这一族的血脉就断绝了。
    他是一个受人欢迎的人。孩子们往往因为他的好性情来捉弄他。他的家成了孩子们的家。他顽强地保持着土著部落的习俗——永远笑容可掬、待人慷慨真诚，而且贫穷得一文莫名。”
