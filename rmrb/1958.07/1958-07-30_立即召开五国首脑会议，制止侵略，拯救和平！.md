    Immediately Convene a Five-Power Summit to Stop Aggression and Save Peace!
    In light of the emergency situation created by the Anglo-American aggression in the Middle East, peace-loving people all over the world warmly welcome and eagerly await the early convening of the Five-Power Government Summit proposed by the Soviet government, in order to take measures to stop aggression, stabilize the situation in the Middle East, and ease international tensions. However, under the pressure of the world's people's desire for peace and public opinion, the US and British governments, after reluctantly expressing their willingness to participate in a summit within the framework of the Security Council, resorted to extraneous issues and tried their best to delay and sabotage the meeting. At the same time, in addition to continuing to amass forces in the Middle East, the United States and Britain convened a meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council in London, openly continuing to intensify the threat of war. This shows that the US and British aggressors' response to holding a summit is in reality nothing more than an attempt to delay, buy time, and mislead public opinion. They have not at all abandoned their aggression plans, and they have absolutely no sincerity in resolving the tense situation in the Middle East through peaceful negotiations.
    In his letter of the 28th to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France, Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Council of Ministers, in response to this situation, sternly condemned the conspiracies of the US and British governments, and firmly advocated the immediate convening of a Five-Power Government Summit with the participation of the UN Secretary-General to discuss the termination of armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan and measures to consolidate universal peace. This action by the Soviet government struck a blow at the US and British governments' plan to delay and sabotage the summit, exposed their trick of preparing to expand aggression by secretly delaying negotiations, and sounded an emergency alarm to peace-loving people all over the world.
    The situation is serious, because the danger of war is far from over, as the US and British governments have in practice not only not relaxed but are intensifying their adventurous activities to expand aggression. It is precisely because the US and British governments, regardless of the condemnation of world public opinion, continue to adhere to their aggressive stance, that Eisenhower and Macmillan departed from the positions they had expressed in their replies of the 22nd in their respective replies of the 25th and 26th to Khrushchev. In his reply of the 22nd, Macmillan had expressed his agreement with Khrushchev's proposal for an early summit, but he believed that the meeting should be held within the framework of the Security Council. Eisenhower also said in his letter that if everyone wanted a summit, the United States would act together with everyone. However, after the Soviet government agreed to this suggestion, the heads of the US and British governments immediately changed their minds. What Eisenhower and Macmillan discussed in their letters of the 25th and 26th was no longer the direct holding of a summit within the framework of the Security Council. They maliciously suggested that the summit should be handed over to the permanent representatives of the Security Council to arrange, which in reality is to overturn the agreement already reached by the heads of government in their letters, and trap the meeting in a maze of procedural issues, making the convening of the meeting a distant prospect. The reason why the US and British governments adopted this destructive tactic is because their heads, especially Eisenhower, are extremely afraid of appearing as indefensible aggressors at the summit, and afraid that their aggressive acts will inevitably be opposed and stopped, as newspapers in the United States, Britain, and other Western countries have long pointed out.
    The US and British governments' stance of sabotaging the summit and adhering to their aggressive policy cannot but arouse great indignation among the people of the world. The Indian Free Press pointed out: Eisenhower's letters "give people the feeling that Washington will evade earlier promises with half a chance." The Cairo "Al-Ahram" pointed out in its editorial that Eisenhower's reply of the 25th "is hindering the convening of the summit" and is "setting obstacles on the road to peace." Some bourgeois newspapers in the United States and Britain have also sharply criticized and expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of the heads of the US and British governments. The British "Daily Mirror" pointed out in an open letter to US Secretary of State Dulles published on the 28th: The US government "is trying to delay, delay, and delay again, perhaps even sabotage the (top-level) meeting." The American "New York Times" commentator Reston also pointed out that Eisenhower's letter was "to buy time and play tricks."
    French Prime Minister de Gaulle expressed a different attitude in his reply of the 26th to Khrushchev on the issue of holding a summit. He believed that the Security Council had in fact ended its discussion on the Lebanese issue, but had not achieved any positive results. Therefore, he advocated planning a summit without delay. Obviously, the French Prime Minister does not agree with replacing the summit with a Security Council meeting. This view is undoubtedly wise and consistent with the Soviet Union's consistent position.
    Indian Prime Minister Nehru has advocated holding a summit more than once. He reiterated this proposal at a press conference held in Calcutta on the 27th.
    As the US and Britain's conspiracy to delay talks and expand aggression is exposed, all those who demand the maintenance of peace in the world will see more clearly than ever that it is necessary to resolutely break through the various obstacles set up by the US and British governments and immediately hold a meeting of the heads of government of the five countries in order to stop US and British aggression in the Middle East and save the Middle East and the world from a serious disaster!
    Peace is still in danger. The world's forces for peace and forces against aggression, quickly mobilize, fight for the convening of a Five-Power Summit, fight to stop aggression and save peace!

### 立即召开五国首脑会议，制止侵略，拯救和平！

    立即召开五国首脑会议，制止侵略，拯救和平！
    鉴于美英侵略中东造成的紧急局势，全世界爱好和平的人民都热烈欢迎并且盼着早日举行苏联政府倡议的五国政府首脑会议，以便采取措施，制止侵略，安定中东的局面，缓和国际紧张局势。但是，美英政府在全世界人民的和平愿望和舆论的压力下，勉强地表示愿意在安理会范围内参加政府首脑会议之后，又节外生枝，竭力拖延和破坏这个会议。同时，美英两国除继续在中东集结兵力外，还在伦敦召集巴格达条约理事会会议，公然继续加紧战争威胁。这说明了美英侵略者对于举行首脑会议的答复，实际上无非为着拖延时日，迷惑舆论。他们还完全没有放弃侵略计划，完全没有通过和平谈判来解决中东紧张局势的诚意。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫于28日给美英法政府首脑的信中，针对着这种形势，严正地谴责了美英政府的阴谋，并坚决主张立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的五国政府首脑会议，来讨论终止对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉和巩固普遍和平的措施问题。苏联政府的这个行动，打击了美英政府拖延和破坏首脑会议的计划，揭穿了它们借拖延谈判来偷偷准备扩大侵略的把戏；并且向全世界爱好和平的人民敲起了紧急的警钟。
    形势是严重的，由于美英政府在实际上不但没有放松而且还在加紧扩大侵略的冒险活动，战争的危险远没有过去。正是因为美英政府不顾全世界舆论的责难，继续坚持侵略的立场，艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦才在25日和26日分别给赫鲁晓夫的复信中离开了他们在22日的复信中所表示过的立场。麦克米伦在22日的复信中曾表示他同意赫鲁晓夫关于早日举行政府首脑会议的主张，但是他认为这个会议应该在安全理事会的范围内举行。艾森豪威尔在他的信中也说，如果大家都希望举行政府首脑会议，美国将同大家一起行事。可是，在苏联政府同意了这个意见之后，美英政府首脑就立刻改变了他们的主意。艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦在25日和26日信中所谈的，已经不再是直接举行安全理事会范围内的政府首脑会议了，他们居心不良地提出，首脑会议要交给安理会的各国常任代表去安排，这实际上就是推翻各国政府首脑在信件中已经达成的协议，而使会议陷入程序问题的迷魂阵，使会议的召集变为遥遥无期。美英政府所以采取这种破坏手腕，是因为它们的首脑特别是艾森豪威尔极端害怕在政府首脑会议上将作为无法辩护的侵略者出现，害怕他们的侵略行为必然要受到反对和制止，关于这一点，美国、英国和其他西方国家的报纸早就指出来了。
    美英政府破坏首脑会议坚持侵略政策的立场，不能不引起全世界人民的极大愤慨。印度自由新闻指出：艾森豪威尔的信件“使人们觉得，只要有一半机会，华盛顿就会规避早些时候的诺言”。开罗“金字塔报”在社论中指出，艾森豪威尔25日的复信“是在阻挠首脑会议的召开”，并且是“在和平的道路上设置障碍”。美英的一些资产阶级报纸也对美英政府首脑的态度提出了尖锐的指责和不满。英国“每日镜报”在28日发表的给美国国务卿杜勒斯的公开信中指出：美国政府“正在设法拖延、拖延再拖延、或许甚至是破坏（最高级）会议。美国“纽约时报”评论员赖斯顿也指出，艾森豪威尔的信是“为了赢得时间和耍手腕”。
    法国总理戴高乐在26日给赫鲁晓夫的复信中，对举行政府首脑会议的问题表现了不同的态度。他认为安理会事实上已结束了关于黎巴嫩问题的讨论，但是没有获得任何积极的结果。所以，他主张毫不迟延地筹划政府首脑会议。显然，法国总理不赞成以安理会会议来代替政府首脑会议。这种看法无疑是明智的，并且与苏联的一贯主张相符合。
    印度总理尼赫鲁曾经不止一次地主张举行最高级会议。他在27日在加尔各答举行的记者招待会上重申了这个主张。
    随着美英拖延会谈、扩大侵略的阴谋的暴露，全世界一切要求维护和平的人士将比任何时候更清楚地看到：必须坚决击破美英政府所设置的各种障碍，立即举行五国政府首脑的会谈，才能制止美英在中东的侵略，使中东和全世界免于一次严重的灾难！
    和平仍然在危急中。全世界的和平力量和反侵略力量迅速动员起来，为召开五国政府首脑会议而斗争，为制止侵略、拯救和平而斗争！
