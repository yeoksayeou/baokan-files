Comrades, compatriots,

	I represent the two million farmers in the suburbs of Beijing in resolutely protesting against the armed aggression of American imperialism against Lebanon, warmly celebrating the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, and paying tribute to the Lebanese people who are bravely resisting American imperialist aggression.

	We farmers bitterly hate this robber behavior of American imperialism. Before liberation, we were oppressed by three great mountains, and the imperialist mountain was the backstage boss of Chiang Kai-shek and the landlord mountains. In Beijing, imperialists used to run rampant in the countryside, wantonly killing farmers and destroying crops, causing countless families to be separated and many people to suffer from cold and hunger. Imperialists are completely heartless jackals. When we heard that the imperialists were invading the Lebanese people again, our lungs were about to explode with anger. Yesterday, farmers throughout the suburbs held meetings in the fields and at home. Everyone regarded the victory of the Lebanese and Iraqi people as their own victory, and their anti-imperialist struggle as our own struggle. We firmly stand with the people of both countries. American imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. With the support of peace-loving people all over the world, this paper tiger will surely roll out of the land of Lebanon, just as it rolled out of China ten years ago.

	We farmers in Beijing, together with the workers, overthrew the feudal rule and built the capital into a beautiful production city. Now, we are engaging in a great leap forward in production. With soaring enthusiasm, we have built the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the Huairou Reservoir, and many water conservancy projects in just over a hundred days, projects that would have taken several years to complete. We overcame the threat of drought and the first flood. When we heard the news of American imperialist aggression against Lebanon, we were extremely angry. We will turn our anger into strength, fully support the struggle of the Lebanese people, and fully support the struggle of the Iraqi people.

	Brothers in Iraq and Lebanon, your struggle is not isolated. We Chinese farmers and the people of the whole country will always stand with you. Final victory is yours. Oppose American imperialist aggression! Defend world peace!

    我们恨透美帝的强盗行为
    农民代表、黄土岗农业社主任殷维臣的讲话同志们，同胞们，
    我代表北京市郊区的二百万农民，坚决地抗议美帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩，热烈地祝贺伊拉克共和国的成立，向英勇抵抗美帝侵略的黎巴嫩人民致敬。
    我们农民，恨透了美帝国主义的这种强盗行为。在解放以前，我们身上压着三座大山，帝国主义这座大山就是蒋介石和地主这两座大山的后台老板。在北京，帝国主义者曾经在农村横行霸道，随便杀害农民，毁坏庄稼，使多少户家庭妻离子散，使多少人受冻挨饿，帝国主义完全是没有心肝的豺狼。当我们听说帝国主义又去侵略黎巴嫩人民，把我们肺都气炸了。昨天，全郊区的农民，在地里，在家里，都开了会，大伙都把黎巴嫩人民和伊拉克人民的胜利，看作是自己的胜利，把他们的反帝斗争，看作是我们自己的斗争，我们坚决地和两国的人民站在一起。美帝国主义只不过是一只纸老虎。在全世界爱好和平的人们的支持下，这个纸老虎，一定会像十年前从中国滚出去那样，滚出黎巴嫩的土地。
    我们北京市的农民，曾经和工人一起，一齐推翻了封建统治，一齐将首都建设成一个美好的生产城市。现在，我们正在搞生产大跃进，我们用冲天的干劲，在一百多天的时间里，修好了要几年才能修好的十三陵水库、怀柔水库和好多水利工程，战胜了干旱威胁和第一次洪水。我们听到美帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩的消息，我们愤怒极了，我们要把愤怒变成力量，全力支持黎巴嫩人民的斗争，全力支持伊拉克人民的斗争。
    伊拉克和黎巴嫩的弟兄们，你们的斗争不是孤立的，我们中国的农民和全国人民永远和你们站在一起。最后胜利是你们的。反对美帝侵略！　保卫世界和平！
