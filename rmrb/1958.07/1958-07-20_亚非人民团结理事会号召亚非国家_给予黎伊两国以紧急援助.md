Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 17th: The Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a call on July 17th to Afro-Asian countries to provide emergency assistance, morally and materially, to Lebanon and Iraq. If the situation further deteriorates, it called to send volunteers to help Lebanon liberate itself from American occupation and to help Iraq repel possible foreign intervention.

In its appeal to the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committees of various Afro-Asian countries, the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council condemned the United States' occupation of Lebanon. It stated that the American imperialists, disregarding the United Nations' report affirming that the nature of the Lebanese nationalist movement is a domestic issue, are attempting to impose their will on the United Nations.

The appeal pointed out that this is reminiscent of historical pirate policies, brutal oppression, colonialist actions, and acts of armed occupation.

The appeal pointed out that the American, British, and French imperialists are panicking because of the Iraqi revolution. It also condemned Britain's dispatch of troops to occupy Jordan, attempting to intimidate the Republic of Iraq and cause its successful revolution to fail.

The appeal calls on the Afro-Asian people to unite and stop the criminal aggressors who threaten world peace and security.

    亚非人民团结理事会号召亚非国家
    给予黎伊两国以紧急援助
    据新华社开罗17日电　亚非人民团结理事会常设书记处在17日号召亚非国家在道义上和物质上给予黎巴嫩和伊拉克以紧急的援助。如果局势进一步恶化，就派遣志愿人员帮助黎巴嫩从美国的占领下解放出来，并且帮助伊拉克击退可能发生的外国干涉。
    亚非人民团结理事会常设书记处在发给亚非各国的亚非团结委员会的呼吁书中，谴责美国占领黎巴嫩。它说，美帝国主义者漠视联合国的关于肯定黎巴嫩民族主义运动的性质是国内问题的报告，力图把它的意愿强加于联合国。
    呼吁书指出，这使人们想起了历史上的海盗政策、残暴的压迫、殖民主义行动和武装占领的行为。
    呼吁书指出，美、英、法帝国主义者因为伊拉克革命而惊慌失措。它还谴责英国派兵占领约旦，企图恫吓伊拉克共和国，使它的成功的革命归于失败。
    呼吁书号召亚非人民团结一致，制止住威胁世界和平和安全的罪恶的侵略者。
