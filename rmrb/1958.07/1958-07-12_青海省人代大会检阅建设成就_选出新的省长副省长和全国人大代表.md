Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 10th: The first session of the Second Qinghai Provincial People's Congress concluded on the afternoon of the 8th, lasting thirteen days.

Yuan Renyuan, Acting Governor of Qinghai Province, delivered a work report on behalf of the Provincial People's Committee. The report stated that Qinghai Province had achieved great accomplishments in all areas during the First Five-Year Plan. The total output value of local industry in 1957 increased more than tenfold compared to 1952, with an average annual increase of 61.6%. The total investment in local capital construction completed 386% of the planned target. The total length of highways open to traffic reached 8,259 kilometers, and a preliminary highway network has been formed throughout the province. In agriculture, the irrigated area was expanded by more than 775,000 mu, and the total grain output reached 1.28 billion jin, both exceeding the original targets. The number of livestock increased by 77% compared to 1952. Surveys in the past five years have proven that Qinghai Province is a region very rich in mineral resources. According to the proven types and reserves of minerals, it is definitely qualified to become one of China's industrial bases.

The report specifically pointed out that in the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward since last winter and this spring, all aspects of work have shown unprecedented new situations. In terms of local industry, it is estimated that the output value of enterprises above the county level in the first half of this year will increase by 70% compared to the same period last year. By the end of May, more than 2,000 small factories and mines had been established or were being established throughout the province. According to statistics from factories and mines in the Xining area in April, more than 600 new products, which were previously unimaginable, such as ball bearings, universal tractors, generators, electric motors, and rayon, were successfully trial-produced. In terms of agricultural production, approximately 300,000 laborers were invested in water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, and by the beginning of June, water conservancy projects capable of irrigating more than 2.94 million mu had been completed. A bumper harvest in agriculture this year is a foregone conclusion. A high tide of agricultural cooperation has been formed in pastoral areas. At present, 1,366 agricultural cooperatives and 224 joint state-private farms have been established throughout the province, with 37.35% of the total number of households joining cooperatives and farms. The Haixi Mongol, Tibetan and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture and the Hainan and Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures have basically realized cooperation.

The report proposed that the tasks of Qinghai Province during the Second Five-Year Plan are: while continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, actively carry out technological and cultural revolutions; establish a backbone industry centered on electricity, iron and steel, machinery manufacturing, and chemical industry; the total industrial output value should exceed the total agricultural and animal husbandry output value; strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule; basically realize agricultural mechanization; reclaim large areas of wasteland; increase yield per unit area; accelerate the socialist transformation of animal husbandry; and promote the great development of animal husbandry production. People of all ethnic groups in the province must strengthen unity on the basis of socialism and fundamentally change the face of Qinghai.

The report emphasized that the rectification movement must be carried out to the end, and that it is necessary to vigorously overcome and criticize the "Qinghai backwardness theory" and feelings of inferiority, break all superstitions and fears, establish a communist style of daring to think independently and daring to innovate, and at the same time, strive to study Chairman Mao's works, go deep into reality, go deep among the masses, and liberate thinking from the old influences.

The meeting unanimously elected Yuan Renyuan as Governor of Qinghai Province, Xiraojiacuo (Tibetan), Sun Junyi, Xue Keming, Gao Keting, Zhang Yichen, Li Fangyuan, Zhaxiwangxu (Tibetan), and Ma Fuchen (Hui) as Deputy Governors of Qinghai Province, and Gao Feng and 29 others as members of the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee; the meeting also elected Cao Juru, Yuan Renyuan, Xiraojiacuo (Tibetan), Sun Junyi, Zhaxiwangxu (Tibetan), Xiarong Ga Bu (Tibetan), Song Bu (Tu), Ma Mingji (Dongxiang), and Guan Baojia (Mongolian) as representatives to the Second National People's Congress.

    青海省人代大会检阅建设成就
    选出新的省长副省长和全国人大代表
    据新华社西宁10日电　青海省第二届人民代表大会第一次会议历时十三天，在8日下午结束。
    青海省代省长袁任远在会上代表省人民委员会作了工作报告。报告中说：青海省在第一个五年计划期间，各方面都取得了巨大的成就。1957年的地方工业总产值比1952年增长了十倍多，平均每年增长61.6％。地方基本建设投资总额完成计划指标的386％。公路通车里程达到八千二百五十九公里，全省的公路网已初步形成。农业方面扩大水地面积七十七万五千多亩，粮食总产量达到十二亿八千万斤，都超额完成了原定指标。牲畜头数比1952年增长了77％。五年来的勘探证明，青海省是一个矿藏非常丰富的地区，根据已探明的矿产种类和蕴藏量来看，肯定有条件成为我国工业基地之一。
    报告特别指出，全省在去冬今春以来的大跃进高潮中，各项工作都出现了空前未有的新局面。地方工业方面，预计县以上的企业单位今年上半年的产值将比去年同期增长70％。到5月底止，全省已经办起和正在兴办的小型厂、矿就有二千多个。据西宁地区各厂、矿4月份的统计，就试制成功了过去根本不敢设想的滚珠轴承、万能拖拉机、发电机、电动机、人造棉等新产品六百多种。在农业生产方面，去冬今春投入水利建设的劳动力约有三十万人，到6月初已完成可灌溉二百九十四万多亩的水利工程。今年的农业丰产已成定局。在牧业区合作化的高潮已经形成。现在全省已建起牧业合作社一千三百六十六个，公私合营牧场二百二十四个，入社、入场的牧户达到总牧户的37.35％。海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州和海南、海北两个藏族自治州已经基本上实现了合作化。
    报告中提出青海省第二个五年计划的任务是：在继续完成经济战线、政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，积极进行技术革命和文化革命；建立以电力、钢铁、机械制造、化学工业为中心的骨干工业，工业总产值要超过农牧业总产值，争取提前实现农业发展纲要，基本实现农业机械化，大量开垦荒地，提高单位面积产量，加速完成畜牧业社会主义改造，促进畜牧业生产的大发展等。全省各族人民要在社会主义的基础上加强团结，从根本上改变青海的面貌。
    报告着重指出，必须把整风运动贯彻到底，要大力克服和批判“青海落后论”和自卑感，打破一切迷信和恐惧心理，树立敢于独立思考、敢于革新创造的共产主义风格，同时要努力学习毛主席的著作，深入实际，深入群众，把思想从旧的影响中解放出来。
    会议最后一致选出袁任远为青海省省长，喜饶嘉错（藏族）、孙君一、薛克明、高克亭、张毅忱、李芳远、扎喜旺徐（藏族）、马辅臣（回族）为青海省副省长，高峰等二十九人为青海省人民委员会委员；会议并选出曹菊如、袁任远、喜饶嘉错（藏族）、孙君一、扎喜旺徐（藏族）、夏茸尕布（藏族）、松布（土族）、马明基（东乡族）、官保加（蒙族）共九人为第二届全国人民代表大会代表。
