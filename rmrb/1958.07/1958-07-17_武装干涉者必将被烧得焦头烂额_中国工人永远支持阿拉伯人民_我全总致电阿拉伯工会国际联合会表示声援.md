Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the Secretary-General, Kamel, of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions, congratulating the birth of the Republic of Iraq, and expressing the Chinese working class and the Chinese people's firm support for the just struggle of the Arab peoples to defend their national independence and sovereignty and oppose imperialist aggression.

The telegram from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions stated: "The Chinese workers and people warmly congratulate the birth of the Republic of Iraq. This is another great victory for the Arab workers and people following the great victory they achieved in resisting the armed aggression by Britain, France, and Israel, and the American conspiracy to intervene militarily in Syria. It is also a major contribution by the Arab workers and people to the cause of defending world peace. It has dealt a new and heavy blow to the imperialists headed by the United States. The imperialists are not reconciled to their shameful defeat. Disregarding the opposition of the people of the Middle East and the whole world, the United States has flagrantly taken action to directly intervene militarily in the internal affairs of Lebanon and is preparing to intervene in the Iraqi people's revolution. The Chinese working class and people are extremely indignant at this naked colonialist behavior of the United States. We firmly support the just struggle of the Arab peoples to defend their national independence and sovereignty and oppose imperialist aggression. We will always stand with the people of Arab countries, the people of Iraq, and the people of Lebanon who are striving for independence and freedom. There is no doubt that the final victory of the struggle will belong to the Arab workers and people. The imperialist interventionists will be burned black and blue in the raging flames of national liberation throughout the Middle East. Please convey our lofty respect and fraternal support to the worker brothers and people of Iraq, Lebanon, and other Arab countries, and wish them greater victories in their struggle."

    武装干涉者必将被烧得焦头烂额
    中国工人永远支持阿拉伯人民
    我全总致电阿拉伯工会国际联合会表示声援
    新华社16日讯　中华全国总工会今天致电阿拉伯工会国际联合会总书记卡迈勒，祝贺伊拉克共和国的诞生，并且表示中国工人阶级和中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民捍卫自己的民族独立和主权、反对帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。
    中华全国总工会的电报说：“中国工人和人民热烈地祝贺伊拉克共和国的诞生。这是阿拉伯工人和人民继反抗英、法、以的武装侵略、美国阴谋武装干涉叙利亚所取得的伟大胜利后的又一次伟大胜利，也是阿拉伯工人和人民对于保卫世界和平事业的重大贡献。它给以美国为首的帝国主义者以新的沉重的打击。帝国主义者对它们可耻的失败是不甘心的，不顾中东和全世界人民的反对，美国已悍然采取了直接武装干涉黎巴嫩内政的行动并准备干涉伊拉克人民革命。中国工人阶级和人民对于美国这种赤裸裸的殖民主义行为感到十分愤怒。我们坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民捍卫自己的民族独立和主权、反对帝国主义侵略的正义斗争，我们永远和争取独立、自由的阿拉伯人民、伊拉克人民和黎巴嫩人民站在一起。毫无疑问，斗争的最后胜利必将属于阿拉伯的工人和人民，帝国主义干涉者将在整个中东的民族解放的熊熊怒火中烧得焦头烂额。请把我们崇高的敬意和兄弟般的支持转达给伊拉克、黎巴嫩和其它阿拉伯国家的工人兄弟和人民，并祝他们的斗争取得更伟大的胜利。”
