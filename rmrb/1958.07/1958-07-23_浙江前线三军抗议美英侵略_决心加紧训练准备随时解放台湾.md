    Garrison troops in Hangzhou, Zhoushan, Wenzhou, Ningbo and other places have held protest rallies in the past few days. At a protest rally of the Hangzhou garrison attended by more than 1,300 officers and soldiers of the army, navy and air force, Qian Jun, Deputy Commander of the Zhejiang Military Region, severely condemned the aggressive acts of US and British imperialism. He pointed out that Zhejiang is on the front line of national defense, and all officers and soldiers must heighten their vigilance a hundredfold, step up the regularization and modernization of the army, and prepare to liberate our territory of Taiwan. Nine combat heroes who volunteered to participate in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and fought many times with the US and British imperialist aggressor troops unanimously expressed at the meeting that they would firmly grasp the weapons in their hands and be ready to fight to crush the imperialist war conspiracy at any time.
    Many companies of the PLA troops stationed on the coastal defense outposts of Zhoushan, Ningbo, and Wenzhou have published special issues. Officers and soldiers have been writing protest letters, big-character posters, letters, and articles all night long, denouncing the crimes of aggression committed by US and British imperialism. Everywhere there are voices resolutely demanding that the US aggressor troops get out of Lebanon, the British aggressor troops get out of Jordan, and the US aggressor troops get out of our Taiwan.
