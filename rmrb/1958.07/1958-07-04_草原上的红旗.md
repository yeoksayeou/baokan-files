    Red Flag on the Prairie
    Jin Ren
    This time we really reached the prairie, and it was the prairie north of the Great Wall.
    In early summer, we set off from Zhangjiakou, crossed the Langwogou, which is over 1,800 meters above sea level, and soon arrived at Bashang. Bashang is the prairie area of Zhangjiakou Prefecture.
    My first impression of the prairie was like a green sea. We were speeding across the prairie in a car, like sailing a small boat through the boundless green ocean. Looking into the distance, there were some scattered moving objects, which were herds of livestock grazing on the prairie. Some places seemed to protrude, and those were small villages. Whether it was herds of livestock or small villages, it was difficult to see them clearly without getting close.
    We heard from other comrades that the prairie used to be a very poor place. There were heavy sandstorms, the climate was cold, the land was barren, there was no fuel, and no food. The lives of the people were very hard, so there were relatively few residents on the prairie. After liberation, the lives of the prairie people underwent tremendous changes. Life is completely different from before.
    Our car sped forward on the prairie. Soon, we saw a red flag in the distance, flying high on a mound. A comrade who was traveling with us said:
    "The Hailiutu Reservoir is here!"
    The red flag on the mound got closer and closer, and we gradually saw the construction site, the dam, and the crowd of people working on the construction site.
    Thousands of male and female farmers were all busy working. Carrying soil, digging soil, carrying stones, and ramming, they were really putting in enough effort to transform the face of the prairie in the shortest possible time.
    In the headquarters, we saw the heroes who built this prairie reservoir. Most of these heroes were women. There was the Iron Old Woman, the Iron Girls, the Mu Guiying Team, the Hua Mulan Team, and the Yang Paifeng Team leaders. We also saw An Zhanyuan, the stone-carrying hero nicknamed "Iron Ox."
    The Iron Old Woman's name is Li You. She is already fifty-seven years old, with small bound feet, and is completely a typical rural woman from the old era. But now she has become a hero of the new era.
    She started working on the reservoir construction from the fifth day of the first lunar month this year, in weather of thirty-eight or nine degrees below zero, and has not stopped working until now. In the coldest time, the prairie was swept by six or seven-level winds, and it was difficult to even stretch out your hands. Some people advised her to go home and rest for a few days, but she replied:
    "Freezing hands and feet can't freeze my heart; even if I dig with a needle, I have to build the reservoir."
    I shook the Iron Old Woman's hand tightly and asked her, "How can you have such drive?"
    She said: "This is nothing, I haven't used up my strength yet. I have lived on the prairie for fifty years, and I have never had enough to eat or enough to wear. Only the Communist Party came and enabled me to live a happy life. In the past, we only harvested forty or fifty catties of grain per mu here. After paying taxes and rent, how much grain could we have left to eat? In 1952, a large canal was built, and in the first year, our grain yield reached two hundred and thirteen catties per mu. Now that we have built a reservoir, we must also make the grain on the prairie catch up with the south of the Yangtze River. With Chairman Mao leading us, we will definitely be able to do it!"
    The Iron Girl, Liu Bulan, interjected: "We also want to green the prairie, turn the prairie into a forest, and change the climate on the prairie; in the past, we could only grow naked oats and potatoes, and in the future, we will grow wheat, grow rice, and eat rice and white flour!"
    The stone-carrying hero, An Zhanyuan, is a sturdy, tall farmer. Looking at his heroic appearance, and thinking that he can carry stones weighing four hundred catties at a time, he truly deserves the nickname "Iron Ox."
    I sat next to An Zhanyuan, and while he was smoking, he said to me:
    "The lives of us people on the prairie used to be really miserable. Not to mention cigarettes, there wasn't even a place to buy a box of matches. The lives we have now are something we never dreamed of before. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, not only grow more grain on the prairie, but also fill the prairie with cattle, sheep, and horses, and also open mines and build factories. Come and see again in two years, and this place won't be like the prairie anymore!"
    I was encouraged by these enthusiastic words and left with a deep impression. When I came out of the headquarters, I saw the red flag on the mound again, fluttering in the wind.
    "They have already planted the red flag on the prairie!"

### 草原上的红旗

    草原上的红旗
    金人
    这一次我们真的到了草原上，而且是塞北的草原。
    初夏的时候，我们从张家口出发，翻过了拔海一千八百多公尺高的狼窝沟，很快就到了坝上。坝上就是张家口专区的草原地带。
    草原给我的第一个印象，就像是一片绿色的海，我们坐着车在草原上飞驰，就像坐着小船在无边无际的绿色海洋里破浪前进。向远处望去，有些星星点点的活动的东西，那是在草原上牧放的牲口群。有些地方好像凸出一块，那是一些小村庄。不管是牲口群和小村庄，如果不走近是很难看清楚的。
    我们听别的同志讲过，从前草原是很穷苦的地方。风沙大，气候寒冷，土地硗薄，没有燃料，没有粮食，人民的生活非常苦，所以草原上的居民也比较少。解放以后，草原人民的生活发生了巨大的变化。日子过得和从前完全不同了。
    我们的汽车在草原上飞速地前进。不久，就远远地看到了一面红旗，高高地飘扬在一个土岗上。一位跟我们同行的同志说：
    “海流图水库到啦！”
    土岗上的红旗越离越近，渐渐地看到了工地，看到了水坝，看到了工地上的人群。
    几千名男女农民，都在忙碌地工作。挑土、掘土、背石头、打夯，他们真是鼓足了干劲，要在最短的时间内改造草原的面貌。
    我们在指挥部里看到了修建这个草原水库的英雄们，这些英雄有一大半是妇女。这里有铁老太太、铁姑娘、有穆桂英队、花木兰队和杨排风队的队长，我们还看到了绰号“铁牛”的背石英雄安占元。
    铁老太太的名字叫李友，她已经五十七岁了，两只小脚，完全是一个旧时代农村妇女型的人物。但是她现在却成了新时代的英雄。
    她从今年阴历正月初五，在零下三十八、九度的天气里就参加了修水库的工作，一直到现在没有停过工。最冷的时候，草原上刮着六、七级的大风，手都难以伸出来，有人劝她回家去休息几天，她回答说：
    “冻手冻脚，冻不了我的心；就是用针尖挖，我也非得把水库修成不可。”
    我紧紧地握着铁老太太的手，问她：“您怎么会有这样一股子干劲儿呢？”
    她说：“这算啥，我的劲儿还没有用够呢。我在草原上住了五十年，没有吃饱过，没有穿暖过，只有共产党来了才使我过起了幸福的生活。从前俺们这儿一亩地只打四五十斤粮食，除了征租纳税，哪儿还能剩多少粮食给俺们吃呢？1952年修了一道大渠，头一年就使俺们的粮食一亩打到了二百十三斤。俺们现在修好水库，还要叫草原上的粮食赶上江南呢，有毛主席领导着俺们，一定能办到！”
    铁姑娘刘步兰插嘴说：“俺们还要绿化草原，要把草原变成森林，要把草原上的气候改变；从前俺们只能种莜麦和山药蛋，以后俺们就要种小麦，种稻子，吃大米吃白面啦！”
    背石英雄安占元是一个虎背熊腰、身材高大的农民，我看着他那种英气勃勃的样子，想到他一次可以背动四百斤重的石头，真不愧有“铁牛”的绰号呀。
    我和安占元并排坐着，他一面抽着烟，一面对我说：
    “俺们草原上的人从前的日子真是苦透啦，别说是烟卷，就连一盒洋火都没地方去买。俺们如今的日子是从前做梦也想不到的。俺们一定听毛主席的话，不但要在草原上多打粮食，还要叫牛、羊、马布满草原，还要开矿，办工厂，过两年你再来看吧，俺们这儿就再不像草原啦！”
    我被这些热情的话所鼓舞着，脑子里留下了深刻的印象，从指挥部走出来，又看见了土岗上的红旗，正被风吹得哗啦啦乱飘。
    “他们已经把红旗插在草原上啦！”
