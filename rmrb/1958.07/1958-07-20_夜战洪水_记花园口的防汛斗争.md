Fighting the Flood at Night
    — A Record of the Flood Control Struggle at Huayuankou
    By our reporters Zhang Lizhong and Liu Jiansheng
    On the night of the 17th, it was already twelve o'clock. On the highway from Zhengzhou to Huayuankou, cars were rushing towards Huayuankou one after another.

    In the car lights, the reporters saw that the cars were loaded with grass sacks, burlap sacks, timber, generators, calcium carbide lamps, etc. More than two hundred flatbed cars supported by the flatbed workers were also loaded on the cars.

    The heavy rain had just passed, and the road from Zhengzhou to Huayuankou was muddy and difficult to travel. Two to three hundred workers from the Municipal Construction Bureau were responsible for repairing this road. The reporter took more than two hours by car to reach Huayuankou. The responsible persons of the Zhengzhou Municipal Party and government were all here, fighting the flood with the masses all night long.

    On the Huayuankou levee, there were lights everywhere, and flood control personnel were patrolling the levee with lanterns.

    Now, the water of the Yellow River is already four meters higher than the terrain outside the levee. Standing next to the Bagua Pavilion on the Huayuankou levee, the reporter saw crowds of people coming and going. The Bagua Pavilion is where Chiang Kai-shek breached the levee in 1938. The Yellow River water rushed out of this breach, flooding fifty-eight counties, killing five hundred thousand people in Henan Province alone. Although this breach was blocked in 1948, it has never been subjected to such a large amount of water in the past ten years. Now that there is such a large amount of water here, the Party, government, army, and people of Zhengzhou are going all out to support this place.

    Zhengzhou originally planned to organize 10,000 people to go to the levee to provide support, but in an instant, 30,000 citizens and cadres were organized. They also contributed all their baskets, shovels, timber, lighting equipment, and other materials.

    The members of the Huayuankou Agricultural Cooperative said: In the old society, the puppet government came here to breach the levee, but now, the cadres and soldiers of the People's Government have come to defend the levee. This cooperative sent more than 2,000 people to the levee.

    Chen Yuzhen, the mother of six children, was originally designated by the cooperative to stay at home. But she arranged her home affairs, the older children looked after the younger children, and she also went to the levee. The old man Luan Guichuan was originally told to stay at home to feed the livestock, but he always went to the levee several times a day. He said: "In the past, Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers forced me to breach Huayuankou with guns, flooding my own home. Now I finally have the right to defend my hometown."

    夜战洪水
    ——记花园口的防汛斗争
    本报记者　张励中　刘健生
    17日的夜晚，已经十二点钟了，从郑州通往花园口的公路上，一辆接一辆的汽车奔往花园口。
    记者在车灯照耀中，看到车上装满草袋、麻袋、木材、发电机、电石灯等，平车工人支援的二百多辆平车，也装在汽车上。
    大雨刚过，郑州到花园口的公路泥泞难走，市建设局的二、三百工人，包修了这条公路。记者坐汽车走了两个多钟头才到花园口。郑州市的党政负责人都在这里，他们彻夜不眠的和群众一起向洪水斗争。
    在花园口大堤上，处处是灯火，防汛人员提着灯笼沿堤巡逻。
    现在，黄河的水已经比堤外地平线高出四公尺。记者站在花园口大堤八挂亭旁边，看到来来往往的人群。八挂亭是1938年蒋介石扒口的地方，黄河水从这个口冲出去，淹了五十八个县，仅河南省就淹死了五十万人。这个口虽经1948年堵住，但十几年来，从来没有经受过这样大的水。现在这里是这样的大水，郑州市的党、政、军、民全力以赴的支援这个地方。
    郑州市本来准备组织一万人上堤支援，可是，市民、干部一下子就组织了三万人。他们还贡献自己所有的筐、铁锹、木材、照明设备等物资。
    花园口农业社的社员们说：旧社会伪政府到这里来扒口，现在，人民政府的干部、官兵来保卫大堤。这个社，出动了两千多人上堤。
    六个孩子的妈妈陈玉珍本来社里确定她在家。但她把家安排好，大孩子看着小孩子，也跟着上堤了。老汉栾桂川，本来叫他在家喂牲口，但他一天总要到堤上去几次，他说：“过去，蒋介石的兵拿枪逼着我扒开花园口，淹了自己的家，现在才正有权保卫自己的家乡。
