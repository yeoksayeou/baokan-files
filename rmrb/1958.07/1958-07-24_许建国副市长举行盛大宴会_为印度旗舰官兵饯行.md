Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 23rd: Vice Mayor of Shanghai Xu Jianguo held a farewell banquet in the hall of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee on the evening of the 22nd to bid farewell to all officers and soldiers of the Indian flagship "Mysore," who were about to conclude their visit to Shanghai.

Commander of the Indian Naval Fleet, Rear Admiral Chakravarti, Captain Nanda of the "Mysore" flagship, Military Attaché of the Indian Embassy in China, Brigadier General Sharma, Indian Consul General in Shanghai, Charlie, and officers and soldiers of the "Mysore" flagship were invited to attend the banquet.

Among those present were Vice Mayors of Shanghai Sheng Pihua, Zhao Zukang, Rong Yiren, Commander of the East China Sea Fleet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Vice Admiral Tao Yong, Political Commissar, Lieutenant General Kang Zhiqiang, Deputy Commander of the Shanghai Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Lieutenant General Liu Fei, Deputy Political Commissar, Major General Ouyang Ping, Military Attaché of the Chinese Embassy in India, Senior Colonel Zhang Tong, and more than 150 people from all walks of life in Shanghai.

Consuls from various countries stationed in Shanghai were also invited to attend the banquet.

Vice Mayor Xu Jianguo said at the farewell banquet: "General Chakravarti's visit to Shanghai with the Indian flagship 'Mysore' has made another friendly contribution to promoting mutual understanding and friendship between our two countries' armies, especially the navies. We believe that on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference, the friendship between the fraternal people of China and India will develop day by day." He said: "Now, the American and British imperialists have launched military aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and are threatening the independence of Iraq. The era in which imperialists vainly attempt to act like overlords and ride roughshod over the people of Asia and Africa is definitely over. The people of Asia and Africa, who have risen up and refuse to be slaves, have full confidence and strength to defend their national independence and freedom and smash the imperialists' aggression. If the imperialists do not pull back from the brink, immediately withdraw their invading troops, and stop war provocations, the Arab people, with the support of peace-loving people all over the world who oppose aggressive war, will surely send the aggressors to their graves in the end."

Rear Admiral Chakravarti and Captain Nanda thanked the hosts in their speeches for their warm hospitality and welcome during their visit. Rear Admiral Chakravarti said, "Our six-day visit to Shanghai felt like living in our own home. Although we are leaving tomorrow, our hearts will remain here." He invited the Chinese Navy to send warships to visit India in the future on behalf of the Indian Navy.

At the banquet, the hosts and guests frequently toasted to the friendship between the people and armies of China and India, to peace in Asia and the world, and to each other's health.

After the banquet, the guests were invited to attend a theatrical performance.

On the afternoon of the 22nd, Rear Admiral Chakravarti delivered a farewell speech to the Chinese people through the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station.

    许建国副市长举行盛大宴会
    为印度旗舰官兵饯行
    新华社上海23日电　上海市副市长许建国22日晚在市人民委员会大厅举行欢送宴会，为即将结束在上海访问的印度“迈索尔”号旗舰全体官兵饯行。
    印度海军舰队司令查克洛伐蒂海军少将、“迈索尔”号旗舰舰长南达海军上校、印度驻我国大使馆武官夏尔玛准将、印度驻上海总领事查理和“迈索尔”号旗舰的官兵们应邀出席了宴会。
    出席作陪的有上海市副市长盛丕华、赵祖康、荣毅仁，中国人民解放军海军东海舰队司令员陶勇海军中将、政治委员康志强中将，中国人民解放军上海警备区副司令员刘飞中将、副政治委员欧阳平少将、我国驻印度大使馆武官张彤大校和上海各界人士共一百五十多人。
    各国驻上海领事也应邀出席了宴会。
    许建国副市长在送别宴会上说：“这次查克洛伐蒂将军率领印度‘迈索尔’号旗舰来上海访问，对促进我们两国军队，特别是两国海军之间的相互了解和友谊又作出了友谊的贡献。我们相信在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神的基础上，中印两国兄弟人民之间的友谊将日益发展。”他说：“现在，美英帝国主义者发动了对黎巴嫩、约旦的军事侵略，并且威胁着伊拉克的独立。帝国主义妄想作威作福，跨在亚非人民头上的时代肯定是过去了。已经行动起来的不愿做奴隶的亚非人民，完全有信心有力量来保卫自己民族的独立和自由，粉碎帝国主义者的侵略。帝国主义者如果不悬崖勒马，立即撤退侵略军队，停止战争挑衅，阿拉伯人民在全世界反对侵略战争维护和平人民的支持之下，一定会把侵略者最后送进坟墓。”
    查克洛伐蒂海军少将和南达海军上校在讲话中，感谢主人对他们访问期间对他们的盛情招待和欢迎。查克洛伐蒂海军少将说：“我们在上海的六天访问，好像是住在自己家里一样。我们明天虽然走了，但是我们的心还留在这儿。”他代表印度海军邀请中国海军将来派军舰到印度访问。

    宴会后，客人们应邀参加了戏剧晚会。
    22日下午，查克洛伐蒂海军少将通过上海人民广播电台向中国人民致了告别词。
