Where Does "Perfection" Come From?
Su Wei

    A kind of "perfectionist" thinking is hindering the promotion of improved farm tools. Don't believe it? Look at the facts: When the comrades in Huangping County, Guizhou Province, were bound by "perfectionist" thinking, the work of promoting improved farm tools in the county was completely stalled; once they abandoned "perfectionist" thinking, the work of promoting improved farm tools was rapidly carried out throughout the county. They spent just over a month improving the tools used in the largest amount of agricultural activities during the summer production season: weeding rice seedlings, applying fertilizer, eliminating insects, and so on. Due to the widespread promotion of these improved farm tools, labor efficiency increased by two to five times, which greatly contributed to the summer field management work in the county and created better conditions for a bumper autumn harvest.

    "Perfectionist" thinking is actually the most imperfect and unbeautiful thinking. Having this kind of thinking will not only hinder the current promotion of improved farm tools, but will also hinder the fundamental cause of agricultural mechanization in our country. Because this kind of thinking fundamentally violates the laws of development of things. We know that everything in the world is constantly developing from imperfection to perfection, from low-level to high-level, from simple to complex. Perfection develops from imperfection. Whoever looks down on things that seem low-level today but are developing forward will never get high-level, perfect things. Without the manual industry of the past, there could be no modern, large-scale industry today. The same is true for agriculture. Looking down on improved farm tools will certainly not create more advanced agricultural machinery; despising the farm tool reform movement will inevitably delay the earlier arrival of agricultural mechanization. Moreover, there is only relative "perfection" in the world, and no absolute "perfection."

    Marxism teaches us that everything must proceed from specific times, places, and conditions. What are our current times, places, and conditions? It is China in 1958. In this year, our country began a great leap forward in various construction undertakings, and a universal shortage of labor has emerged. However, our conditions do not allow us to immediately replace all tools, especially agricultural tools, with machines to improve labor efficiency and solve the labor shortage. Please consider, is it better to universally promote improved farm tools, thereby ensuring the realization of the Great Leap Forward and creating conditions for the further realization of agricultural mechanization? Or is it better to wait for "perfect" improved farm tools like the "perfectionists," thereby causing the pace of the Great Leap Forward to stagnate and ultimately delaying the arrival of agricultural mechanization?

### “十全十美”从何而来

    “十全十美”从何而来
    苏蔚
    有一种叫做“十全十美”的思想，正在妨碍着改良农具的推广。不信么？请看事实：贵州省黄平县的同志们被“十全十美”思想束缚着的时候，全县改良农具的推广工作完全陷入了停顿状态；一旦抛弃了“十全十美”的思想以后，改良农具的推广工作就在全县迅速开展起来了。他们只用了一个月多一点的时间，就在全县的范围内把夏季生产中最大量的农事活动：薅秧、追肥、灭虫等等方面的工具改良了。由于这些改良农具的普遍推广，劳动效率提高了两倍到五倍，从而使全县的夏季田间管理工作取得了很大的成就，为秋季大丰收创造了更好的条件。
    “十全十美”的思想实际上是最不全最不美的思想，有了这种思想不仅要妨碍目前的改良农具的推广工作，还会妨碍我国农业机械化的根本大业。因为这种思想本身就是从根本上违背了事物的发展规律。我们知道，世界上任何事物总是由不完美向完美不停地发展着的，总是由低级到高级，由简单到复杂发展的。完美是由不完美发展起来的。谁瞧不起今天看来还是低级的然而却正在向前发展的东西，谁就永远得不到高级的完美的东西。没有过去的手工工业，就不可能有今天的现代化大工业。工业如此，农业也是这样。看不起改良农具，一定创造不出更高级更先进的农业机器；轻视农具改革运动，也就一定会推迟农业机械化更早的到来。何况世界上从来只有相对的“十全十美”，没有绝对的“十全十美”呢？
    马克思主义教导说，一切要从具体的时间、地点和条件出发。我们现在的时间、地点、条件是什么呢？是1958年的中国。这一年我国开始了各项建设事业的大跃进，出现了劳力普遍不足的现象。而我们的条件又不能马上把一切工具，特别是农业工具都换成机器，以提高劳动效率，解决劳力不足的困难。请看，是普遍推广改良农具，从而保证大跃进的实现，并为进一步实现农业机械化创造条件好呢？还是像“十全十美”论者为了等待“十全十美”的改良农具，从而使大跃进的步伐停滞下来，并终至推迟农业机械化的到来好呢？
