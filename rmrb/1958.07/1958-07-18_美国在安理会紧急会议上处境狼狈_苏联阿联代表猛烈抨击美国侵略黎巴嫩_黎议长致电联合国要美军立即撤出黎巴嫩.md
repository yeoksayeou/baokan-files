Xinhua News Agency, July 17th dispatch from New York: At the emergency meetings of the United Nations Security Council on the 16th, the United States' armed intervention in Lebanon continued to be condemned by the representatives of the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic. Other speakers expressed coolness or reservations about the US proposal to have the United Nations agree to the US aggression and to send UN troops to Lebanon.

    Soviet Representative Sobolev read the Soviet government's statement on the Near East situation at the meeting and fiercely criticized the US proposal. He emphasized that if the Security Council were to pass such a proposal, it would mean that it approved of the act of aggression against the Lebanese people and the act of aggression against the people of other Arab countries.

    Sobolev said that there was absolutely no reason for the US troops to go to Lebanon, regardless of what excuses they might find to justify their presence there. The United States is now engaged in a dirty deal against Arab nationalism, and the Security Council must stop this reckless action that could lead to another world war.

    Sobolev revealed that the United States provided intelligence to "justify" the dispatch of US Marines to Lebanon only after sending troops, pointing out that such "intelligence" could always be "proven" or "confirmed" "in a country already occupied by US armed forces."

    Sobolev said, "This is the monstrous lie, mockery, and deception that the United States is now using to achieve its aggressive aims, just as Hitler used monstrous lies to achieve his aggressive aims."

    The United Arab Republic representative, Lutfi, refuted the accusations made by the US representative, Lodge, against the United Arab Republic in his speech. He emphasized that these accusations were not in accordance with the facts and had been overturned by the conclusions of the United Nations observers. Lutfi also drew the Security Council's attention to the fact that US intervention in Lebanon had caused anxiety and indignation throughout the world.

    Lutfi read a telegram sent by the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the Security Council, which demanded the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon.

    The telegram condemned the US government's action of sending troops to land in Lebanon under the "guise of protecting the lives of American citizens and defending the sovereignty of Lebanon" as "an infringement of Lebanon's independence and sovereignty." The telegram emphasized that the lives and interests of Americans had never been endangered; the crisis in Lebanon was a domestic crisis.

    The Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament said, "Therefore, I believe that I must protest this act of infringing on the sovereignty and independence of Lebanon on behalf of the parliament, and I believe that the landing of US troops is a threat to peace and security in the Middle East." "I believe that the United States should be responsible for any unimaginable consequences that may lead to a world war."

    Swedish Representative Jarring said that the Swedish government believed that, under the current circumstances, the measures taken by the United States were not in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter – the so-called article on self-defense. The Swedish government did not believe that there was currently an "international conflict" as mentioned in Article 51.

    Jarring said that the actions taken by the US government had "greatly changed the conditions for observers to carry out their activities in Lebanon." He stated that the Swedish government reserved the right to submit a proposal advocating the suspension of the "observation" work being carried out there due to the changed situation in Lebanon.

    While whitewashing the US aggression, Lodge shamelessly stated that "no country on earth is more friendly to Arab nationalism than the United States." He tried his best to defend the US proposal. He preposterously tried to prove that the US occupation of Lebanon was in line with the UN Charter and could promote the completion of the observer group's mission. He said that the US troops entering Lebanon had received orders to establish contact with the observers and cooperate with them. However, the observer group's report to the United Nations exposed Lodge's lies. The observer group's report stated that the United Nations Observer Group in Lebanon did not intend to "formally or informally contact or cooperate with non-Lebanese troops in Lebanon."

    美国在安理会紧急会议上处境狼狈
    苏联阿联代表猛烈抨击美国侵略黎巴嫩
    黎议长致电联合国要美军立即撤出黎巴嫩
    据新华社17日讯　纽约消息：在联合国安全理事会16日上下午的紧急会议上，美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的行动继续遭到苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国代表的谴责，其他发言的人对美国提出的要联合国同意美国的侵略行动和关于派联合国部队到黎巴嫩去的提案也表示冷淡或保留态度。
    苏联代表索波列夫在会上宣读了苏联政府就中近东事件发表的声明，并且猛烈抨击美国的提案。他强调指出，安全理事会如果通过这种提案，就意味着它赞同对黎巴嫩人民的侵略行为，赞同对其他阿拉伯国家人民的侵略行为。
    索波列夫说，美国军队完全没有理由到黎巴嫩去，不论它们可能找到什么借口证明它们有理由到那里去。美国现在正在进行反对阿拉伯民族主义的肮脏勾当，安全理事会必须制止这种导致另一次大战的轻率行动。
    索波列夫揭露美国是在派遣军队以后才提供情报证明“有理由”派遣美国海军陆战队到黎巴嫩去的，他指出，“在一个已经处于被美国武装部队占领状态的国家中”这种“情报”总是可以得到“证明”或“证实”的。
    索波列夫说，“这是美国现在使用的来实现它的侵略目的的弥天大谎、嘲弄和欺骗，正像希特勒利用弥天大谎来实现他的侵略目的一样。”
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表卢特菲在发言中驳斥了美国代表洛奇对阿拉伯联合共和国的指责。他强调说，这种指责不符合事实，并且已被联合国观察员的结论推翻。卢特菲同时提请安全理事会注意，美国对黎巴嫩的干涉已经引起了全世界的不安和愤慨。
    卢特菲宣读了黎巴嫩议会议长发给联合国秘书长和安理会主席的一份电报，这份电报要求美军立即撤出黎巴嫩。
    电报谴责美国政府在“保护美侨生命和保卫黎巴嫩的主权的幌子下”派兵在黎巴嫩登陆的行动“侵犯了黎巴嫩的独立和主权”。电报强调指出，美国的生命和利益从来没有受到过危害；黎巴嫩的危机是一个国内的危机。
    黎巴嫩议会议长说，“因此我认为，我必须代表议会抗议这种侵犯黎巴嫩的主权和独立的行动，我认为，美国军队的登陆是对中东和平和安全的威胁。”“我认为，美国应该对可能导致世界大战的任何不堪设想的影响负责。”
    瑞典代表雅林说，瑞典政府认为，在目前情况下，美国所采取的措施并不符合联合国宪章第五十一条条文——所谓自卫的条文。瑞典政府不认为目前在那里有第五十一条所说的“国际冲突”。
    雅林说，美国政府所采取的行动已经“大大改变了观察员在黎巴嫩进行活动的条件”。他表示瑞典政府保留提出一项提案的权利，这项提案主张由于黎巴嫩局势改变而中断在那里进行的“观察”工作。
    洛奇在粉饰美国的侵略行动时居然无耻地表示“地球上再没有任何国家比美国更对阿拉伯民族主义友好了。”他竭力为美国提案进行辩解。他信口开河地硬要证明，美国军队侵占黎巴嫩是符合联合国宪章和能够促进观察小组任务的完成的。他说，进入黎巴嫩的美军已经接到命令同观察员建立接触，并且同他们合作。然而观察小组给联合国的报告却戳穿了洛奇的鬼话。这个观察小组的报告说，联合国黎巴嫩观察小组并不打算“正式或非正式地同黎巴嫩境内的非黎巴嫩军队”进行接触或合作。
