Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 4th:  Tianjin, one of China's major industrial bases, overfulfilled its industrial production leap forward plan for the first half of the year by 3.95%.

    Tianjin's total industrial output value in the first half of this year actually increased by 37.55% compared to the same period last year. The increase between each month was also very significant.  Taking the average daily output value in January as 100, it reached 107 in February, 124 in March, 132 in April, 143 in May, and 190 in June.

    The outstanding completion of tasks by Tianjin workers is also reflected in the significant improvement in product quality and the large-scale successful trial production of important new products. According to incomplete statistics, Tianjin has successfully trial-produced more than 1,900 new products this year, with an average of more than ten new products born every day. The quality of more than 200 products in the city has reached advanced domestic or world levels. For example, high-strength enameled wire and reactive dyes have caught up with or surpassed the United Kingdom, high-grade "Ostrich" ink has surpassed American "Parker," and "Temple of Heaven" accordions have caught up with the famous Italian "Soberani."

    According to the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League alone, in June, young workers across the city proposed more than 1.3 million innovation suggestions, including more than a thousand major initiatives of national or even international significance, which increased production efficiency several times or even tens of thousands of times. The most prominent example is that Zhu Xiangjie and Li Xuecheng, workers at the Zhongtian Motor Factory, used chemical treatment to replace manual scraping of enameled wire ends, making one day's work equivalent to forty-nine years.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 5th: Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, Anshan Iron and Steel workers victoriously completed the production plans for total output value, iron, steel, steel products, coke, and iron ore for the first half of this year. Compared with the same period last year, Anshan Iron and Steel workers produced an additional 330,000 tons of steel, 350,000 tons of iron, and more than 320,000 tons of steel products in the first half of this year.

    In the first half of the year, Anshan Iron and Steel has already shown a new look of high-speed development of iron and steel production. The total output value in the first half of this year increased by 31% compared to the same period in 1957, of which the second quarter increased by nearly 40% compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 6th: Workers of the Anshan Metallurgical Construction General Company system overfulfilled the state construction plan for the first half of the year. By the end of June, 60% of the annual workload plan had been completed, 16% more than the same period last year; costs were significantly reduced; and the quality of projects was also improved, with quality accidents reduced by 42% compared to the same period last year.

    In the first half of the year, the workers of this general company system completed nineteen important construction projects for the country. The completion and commissioning of these projects are of great significance for Anshan Iron and Steel Company to achieve a great leap forward in steel production.

Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, July 5th: The Karamay mining area comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan for the first half of the year. By June 30, the main production plans such as drilling, oil extraction, and oil testing were overfulfilled by 20% to 39%. The drilling footage, number of oil testing layers, and crude oil production completed in the first six months of this year are equal to one to one and a half times the entire year of last year.

    In the first half year of officially undertaking the national crude oil production plan, the oil extraction workers overproduced more than 20,000 tons of crude oil. In the first half of the year, in addition to drilling a large number of production wells, more than 40 exploratory wells drilled to expand the oil field area have already produced crude oil. The exploration results in the first half of the year show that the Karamay oil field continues to extend northeastward with great prospects.

    上半年工业战线一片丰收景象
    天津一批产品质量达到世界水平  钢都总产值比去年同期跃增三成
    据新华社天津4日电　我国主要工业基地之一的天津市，超额3.95％完成了上半年的工业生产跃进计划。
    天津市今年上半年工业生产总值比去年同期实际增长了37.55％，各个月份之间上升幅度又非常大，以1月份的平均日产值为一百，到2月份为一百零七，3月份为一百二十四，4月份为一百三十二，5月份为一百四十三，6月份为一百九十。
    天津市工人出色地完成任务，还表现在产品的质量大大提高和重要新产品的大量试制成功上。据不完全的统计，天津市今年已试制成功新产品一千九百多种，平均每天有十多种新产品诞生。全市有二百多种产品的质量达到了国内或世界上的先进水平。像高强度漆包线、活性染料等赶上或超过了英国，高级“鸵鸟”墨水超过了美国“派克”，“天坛牌”手风琴赶上了著名的意大利“索伯拉尼”。
    仅据共青团天津市委员会的了解，6月份全市青年职工提出的革新建议就达一百三十多万件，其中有全国意义甚至有国际意义的重大创举达千多件，它们提高生产效率几倍乃至上万倍。最突出的如中天电机厂工人祝相杰、李学成用化学处理方法代替人工刮漆包线线头，使一天的工作等于四十九年。
    据新华社鞍山5日电　鞍钢职工在总路线的光辉照耀下，胜利地完成了今年上半年的总产值和铁、钢、钢材、焦炭和铁矿石的生产计划。跟去年同期比较，鞍钢职工今年上半年多生产了三十三万吨钢，三十五万吨铁，三十二万多吨钢材。
    上半年，鞍钢已经出现了以高速度发展钢铁生产的新面貌。今年上半年总产值比1957年同期增长31％，其中第二季度比去年同期增长将近40％。
    据新华社鞍山6日电　鞍山冶金建筑总公司系统职工超额完成了上半年国家建设计划。到6月底为止，全年的工作量计划已完成60％，比去年同期多完成16％；成本有了显著降低；工程质量也有了提高，质量事故比去年同期减少42％。
    上半年，这个总公司系统的职工共为国家建成十九项重要工程项目，这些工程的完成和投入生产，对鞍山钢铁公司实现钢产量大跃进具有重大作用。
    据新华社克拉玛依5日电　克拉玛依矿区全面超额完成了上半年的国家计划。到6月30日，钻井、采油、试油等主要生产计划，超额20％到39％完成。今年6个月完成的钻井进尺，试油层数和原油生产量，等于去年全年的一倍到一倍半。
    采油工人在正式担负国家原油生产计划的头半年，就超额生产了原油两万多吨。上半年除钻成大批生产井以外，为扩大油田面积钻凿的探井，有四十多口已钻出原油。上半年勘探结果表明，克拉玛依油田继续向东北方向伸展有很大前途。
