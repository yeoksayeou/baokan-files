Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 11th: The Ministry of Geology recently held a nickel ore professional conference in Yunnan Province. Geological workers from twenty-one provinces proposed at the meeting to, with the heroic spirit of "Iron arms excavating ancient woods, straw sandals trampling mountain clouds," submit two hundred times the nickel ore reserves of the First Five-Year Plan to the state within the next three years, completing the tasks stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule.

This conference summarized China's nickel ore geological work and systematically exchanged experiences in finding nickel ore in various places.

Since 1956, China has successively discovered various types of nickel ore in Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and other provinces. Among them, the nickel ore discovered in Yunnan is the largest, with a ore-bearing area of more than 300 kilometers in length, and is currently under exploration. The reserves already submitted by this mine in the first half of this year are more than four times the national reserves submitted during the entire First Five-Year Plan period; the reserves planned to be submitted in the second half of the year will be even more than those in the first half. Among the mining areas that have been proven in China, there are not only nickel silicate ores but also nickel sulfide ores. The distribution of nickel ore is very wide, and known mining areas and mineralization points are found in all provinces across the country. This shows that China's nickel ore resources are very abundant.

China's nickel ore geological work has only gradually developed since 1956, and various places have accumulated a lot of experience in the past two years. At the meeting, geological workers from Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and other places introduced their experiences in prospecting and exploring different types of nickel ore. The most fascinating of these was the experience of Yunnan Province in discovering nickel silicate ore. No one had ever discovered this type of nickel deposit in China before. Geological workers from various provinces attending the meeting visited this nickel mining area for two days. On-site, they learned how to identify, prospect, and explore six or seven types of nickel ore, and several problems that were not easily solved in books were resolved on-site. They unanimously agreed that the discovery of nickel ore in Yunnan provided a complete set of experiences for nickel ore prospecting and exploration work in China.

The meeting determined the direction of nickel ore prospecting in China based on the experience gained and the actual situation. The meeting required all regions to pay attention to finding nickel sulfide ore and weathered crust nickel silicate ore. The grade of nickel sulfide ore is generally high, and the processing and smelting of the ore is relatively easy, so special attention should be paid to it. In addition, attention should also be paid to the comprehensive utilization of ore during exploration, striving to recover more nickel from polymetallic minerals.

After a heated debate, the geological workers present at the meeting broke down several ideas of blindly believing in foreign countries and blindly believing in authority. In the past, some people said that China did not have the ancient land like Canada, and the possibility of finding large nickel mines was very small. This argument has been completely bankrupt in the face of facts. Based on the characteristics of China's geological structure and magmatic activity, the meeting analyzed the characteristics of different nickel deposits across the country and criticized certain dogmatic tendencies that had arisen in some areas in prospecting work.

### “铁臂掏遍远古木　芒鞋踏破岭头云”  地质工作者誓师向镍矿进军

    “铁臂掏遍远古木　芒鞋踏破岭头云”
    地质工作者誓师向镍矿进军
    新华社昆明11日电　地质部最近在云南省召开镍矿专业会议。来自二十一个省的地质工作者在会上提出，要以“铁臂掏遍远古木，芒鞋踏破岭头云”的英雄气概，在今后三年内为国家提交出二百倍于第一个五年计划的镍矿储量，提前两年完成第二个五年计划规定的任务。
    这次会议总结了我国的镍矿地质工作，并且比较系统地交流了各地寻找镍矿的经验。
    从1956年起，我国已经陆续在云南、四川、陕西等省发现了各种类型的镍矿。其中，在云南发现的镍矿最大，含矿地区长达三百多公里，目前正在勘探。今年上半年这个矿已经提交的储量，相当于第一个五年计划期间全国提交储量的四倍多；下半年计划提交的储量，将比上半年还要多。在我国已经探明的矿区中，不仅有矽酸镍矿，而且有硫化镍矿。镍矿的分布很广泛，已知的矿区和矿化点遍及全国各省。这说明我国的镍矿资源是非常丰富的。
    我国的镍矿地质工作从1956年起才逐步开展起来，两年来各地积累了许多经验。会上，云南、四川、陕西等地的地质工作者，介绍了普查、勘探不同类型镍矿的经验，其中最引人入胜的是云南省发现矽酸镍矿的经验。这种镍矿床在我国过去从来没有人发现过。参加会议的各省地质工作者，到这个镍矿区参观了两天。他们在现场学会了辨认、普查和勘探六、七种镍矿石的方法，若干从书本上不易解决的问题，在现场上解决了。他们一致认为：云南镍矿的发现，为我国镍矿普查和勘探工作提供了成套的经验。
    会议根据已取得的经验和实际情况，确定了我国镍矿的找矿方向。会议要求各地注意寻找硫化镍矿和风化壳矽酸镍矿。硫化镍矿石的品位一般较高，矿石的加工和冶炼比较容易，应该特别加以重视。此外，在勘探中还应该注意矿石的综合利用，争取从多金属中回收更多的镍。
    经过热烈的辩论以后，到会的地质工作者打破了若干迷信外国和迷信权威的思想。过去有人说，我国没有加拿大那样的古代陆地，找到大镍矿的可能性很小。这种论调已在事实面前彻底破产了。会议根据我国的地质构造和岩浆活动的特点，分析了全国不同镍矿床的特性，批判了部分地区在找矿工作中所产生的某些教条主义偏向。
