Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th: Kim Eung-sang, Chairman of the State Construction Commission of North Korea, said to Xinhua reporters on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the Korean armistice that North Korea has made brilliant achievements in all aspects of construction over the past five years. During this period, a total of more than 400 large, medium, and small factories and enterprises were newly built and restored. The state invested in the construction of five to six million square meters of housing, as well as many schools, hospitals, cinemas, and theaters. Currently, construction is in full swing everywhere in the cities and villages of North Korea, and the scale and speed of construction are unprecedented in North Korea.

Kim Eung-sang met with reporters in the newly built comprehensive office building of the various ministries of the Cabinet after the war. During the conversation, trucks loaded with building materials drove by one after another on the road outside the window. A six-story residential building across the street outside the window is under construction. Kim Eung-sang said that North Korea's construction has developed rapidly this year. The amount of basic construction this year is more than the total of the first four years after the war. 70% of the state investment is used for productive construction, and 30% is used for non-productive construction. Among the productive construction projects this year, there are more than 50 basic construction projects on a larger scale. The most important non-productive construction projects are housing and schools, as well as the Pyongyang Railway Station building, the South Pyongan Province Theater, and so on.

Kim Eung-sang said that according to the basic economic policy of basically solving the problems of food, clothing, and housing for the people during the first five-year plan period (1957-1961), in order to solve the housing problem, the state will build 10 million square meters of housing during this period. In addition, with the help of the state, agricultural cooperatives will build 200,000 houses themselves.

Kim Eung-sang took Pyongyang as an example to illustrate the scale and speed of housing construction in North Korea this year. He said that the staff of the Pyongyang Municipal Construction Department are doing everything possible to tap potential and promote advanced prefabricated construction methods. They will use the funds planned by the state to build 1,000 households of housing and complete 18,000 households this year, which is about three times the total number of houses built in Pyongyang last year. In addition, another 2,000 households will start construction this year and will be completed next spring. In the next two years, Pyongyang will build another 50,000 houses. By 1960, all residents of Pyongyang will be able to live in newly built modern houses. In addition, agricultural cooperatives have organized construction teams to learn construction techniques. This year, they will build 20,000 rural houses in various places. Korean farmers will soon bid farewell to the low thatched houses they have lived in for thousands of years and move into tall and bright tile-roofed houses.

Kim Eung-sang pointed out that the important reason for the rapid development of construction this year is the implementation of the spirit of the October Plenary Session of the Korean Workers' Party last year, the widespread promotion of advanced prefabricated construction methods, and the promotion of mechanization of construction. This year, the use of prefabricated methods on housing construction sites in Pyongyang has accounted for 95%. Another feature of this year's construction is that the broad masses of people have responded to the Party's call and turned construction into a mass movement. In addition to construction workers, the broad masses of workers, students, farmers, and cadres have participated in the construction.

Kim Eung-sang finally said that the above achievements have been achieved due to the implementation of the correct economic policies of the Korean Workers' Party. Due to the rapid development of industry in North Korea after the war, the current cement production per capita in North Korea has exceeded that of Japan, reaching an average of 130 kilograms per person. At present, North Korea's domestic industry can supply a large amount of building materials such as steel and bricks and tiles. The mass construction movement is rising day by day, and advanced construction methods are being increasingly recognized and mastered by the masses. In the future, various constructions in North Korea will develop more rapidly.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd: The Central Bureau of Statistics of the State Planning Commission of North Korea today issued a communique on the results of the implementation of the people's economic plan in the first half of this year, saying that North Korea's total industrial output value in the first half of this year increased by 34% compared with the same period last year.

The communique said that in the first half of this year, the plan for the total industrial output value of state-owned and cooperative-run industries was overfulfilled by 10%, and the plan including the production increase task was overfulfilled by 1%. Factories and enterprises produced various industrial products worth a total of 5.95 billion won more than the state plan.

Regarding agricultural production, the communique said that this year's spring sowing plan was overfulfilled, and the total sown area increased by 210,000 cho (1 cho is approximately 15 mu) compared with last year. The planting area of rice and corn increased by 25,000 cho and 63,000 cho respectively compared with last year. The planting area of economic crops such as cotton, flax, and tobacco increased by 1.3 times compared with last year.

Many large, medium, and small-scale irrigation projects built in the first half of this year increased the irrigated area by 460,000 cho. As a result, the irrigated area of paddy fields in North Korea increased to 91%. Work on establishing dryland irrigation systems also began in the first half of this year.

The communique said that the total number of employees in the first half of this year reached more than 910,000, an increase of more than 80,000 compared with the first half of last year. Employees' monetary wages increased by 10%. The total retail sales in the first half of this year increased by 39% compared with the same period last year, and prices continued to decline significantly.

    朝鲜五年来建设成就辉煌
    新建和恢复了四百多个大、中、小型工厂和企业
    今年上半年工业产值超过去年同期三分之一多
    据新华社平壤26日电　朝鲜国家建设委员会委员长金应相在朝鲜停战五周年前夕对新华社记者发表谈话说：朝鲜战后五年来进行的各方面的建设，取得了光辉的成就。在这一期间总共新建和恢复了四百多个大、中、小型的工厂和企业，用国家投资新建了五、六百万平方公尺的住宅，另外还建成了许多学校、医院、电影院和剧院等。目前朝鲜北部的城市和乡村到处都在轰轰烈烈地进行建设，建设的规模和速度在朝鲜是空前的。
    金应相在战后新建的内阁各省综合办公厅大楼中接见了记者。在谈话时，满载着建筑材料的卡车一辆辆在窗外马路上驶过。窗外马路对面的一座六层的住宅大楼正在建设中。金应相说，朝鲜的建设在今年有了飞跃的发展。今年的基本建设量比战后的头四年都多。国家投资的70％用于生产性建设，30％用于非生产性建设。在今年进行的生产性的建设方面，较大规模的有五十多个基本建设项目。非生产性的重要建设工程最多的是住宅、学校，另外有平壤车站大楼，平安南道戏院等。
    金应相说，根据在第一个五年计划期间（1957—1961年）基本上解决人民的衣食住问题这一基本经济政策，为了解决住的问题，在这一期间国家要建设一千万平方公尺住宅。另外在国家的帮助下，由农业合作社自己建设二十万栋住宅。
    金应相以平壤市为例，说明了今年朝鲜住宅建设的规模和速度。他说，平壤市建筑部门的职工们千方百计地挖掘潜力，推广先进的装配式建筑方法，他们要用国家计划建设一千户住宅的资金，在今年内建成一万八千户，这大约等于去年平壤市建成住宅的总数的三倍。另外还有二千户在今年内动工，将在明年春季完成。今年上半年已经建成了八千户。在今后二年内，平壤还要建设五万户住宅，到1960年平壤市居民就都能住上新建的现代化的住宅。另外，各农业社都组织了建设队，学习建筑技术。在今年内就要在各地建设二万户农村住宅。朝鲜农民在不久的将来就要同住了几千年的低矮的草房永别，迁入高大敞亮的瓦房中去。
    金应相指出，今年的建设发展得快的重要原因，是贯彻了朝鲜劳动党去年十月全会的精神，广泛推广先进的装配式建筑方法，推行建筑施工的机械化。今年在平壤市住宅建设工地上采用装配式方法的已经占95％。今年建设的另一个特点是广大人民响应党的号召，把建设变成了群众性的运动。除了建筑工人外，广大的工人、学生、农民和干部都参加了建设。
    金应相最后说，上述成绩是由于执行了朝鲜劳动党的正确的经济政策而取得的。由于朝鲜战后工业的迅速发展，现在水泥的产量按朝鲜北部人口平均计算已经超过日本，达到每人平均一百三十公斤。目前，朝鲜国内工业能够大量地供应钢材、砖瓦等建筑材料，群众性的建设运动正日益高涨，先进的建筑方法正日益被群众所认识和掌握。今后朝鲜的各种建设将更迅速地向前发展。
    据新华社平壤23日电　朝鲜国家计划委员会中央统计局今天发表的关于今年上半年人民经济计划执行结果的公报说，朝鲜在今年上半年的工业总产值比去年同期增加了34％。
    公报说，今年上半年超额10％完成了国营和合作社营的工业总产值计划，超额1％完成了包括增产任务在内的计划。各工厂企业共比国家计划多生产了价值五十九亿五千万元朝币的各种工业产品。
    关于农业生产，公报说，今年的春季播种计划超额完成了，播种总面积比去年增加了二十一万町步（一町步约合十五市亩）。水稻和玉蜀黍的种植面积分别比去年增加了二万五千町步和六万三千町步。棉花、亚麻、烟草等经济作物的播种面积比去年增加了一点三倍。
    今年上半年兴修的许多项大、中、小型灌溉工程增加了四十六万町步的灌溉面积，这样一来，朝鲜北部水田中的灌溉受益田增加到91％。今年上半年还开始了建立旱田灌溉系统的工作。
  公报说，今年上半年职工总数达到九十一万多人，比去年上半年增加了八万多人。职工货币工资增加了10％。今年上半年零售商品总额比去年同期增加了39％，物价继续有显著的降低。
