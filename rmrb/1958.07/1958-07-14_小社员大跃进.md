Little Glimpses of the Great Leap Forward

    Little Commune Member's Great Leap Forward
    In the Eighth Village, First Cooperative of Gaohe Township, Qionglai County, Sichuan Province, there is a little commune member named Liu Zhongquan, who is thirteen years old this year, short in stature, with a round face. During the Great Leap Forward, he saw the adults working enthusiastically, and he thought: I must also have a great leap forward, and compare my energy with them. When carrying fertilizer from the mountains to the plains, people carried a hundred catties, and he carried eighty catties. When working in the fields, people didn't straighten their backs, and he didn't straighten his back either, working in one go. When eating, he seized the time to finish his meal, and then went around urging the commune members to go to work in the fields. One day, it was raining, and he carried a load of peat. The road was slippery, and he wasn't wearing straw sandals, and he was sweating all over, but he still ran across Dragon Nose Mountain in one breath. Just as he put down the load, he saw the commune members transplanting rice seedlings, so he went down to the field to transplant rice seedlings. He was small, and the field water was deep, soaking his crotch. He planted a few rows, and then asked for everyone's opinion, saying, "Take a look, is it up to standard? If not, I'll do it again." Everyone took a look, and the spacing between plants and rows was very uniform and upright. This further encouraged his enthusiasm. He planted almost as fast as the adults. Adults planted seven or eight fen of fields a day, and he also wanted to plant five or six fen of fields. The cooperative named him a small model and put him on the honor roll. Some people even adapted his deeds into a clapper talk and sang it everywhere.

    小社员大跃进
    四川邛崃县高何乡八村一社有一个小社员刘中全，今年十三岁，矮矮的个子，圆圆的脸。大跃进中，他看见大人们干得热火朝天，他想：我也得跃进跃进，同他们比比干劲。从高山往平坝背肥料时，人家背一百斤，他就背八十斤。下地干活时，人家不伸腰杆，他也不伸腰杆，一气儿地干。吃饭时，他抓紧时间把饭吃完，就四处去催社员下地干活。有一天，天下着雨，他担了一担泥炭，路又滑，又没穿草鞋，累得浑身是汗，但他还是一口气跑过龙鼻山。刚歇下担子，他看见社员们在插秧，他就下田插秧。他个子小，田水深，把裤裆都湿透了。他栽了几行，就征求大家的意见，说：“你们看一下，合不合规格，不合我重来。”大家一看，窝距行距都很匀称很端正。这一下就更鼓舞了他的干劲。他栽得几乎同大人一样快。大人一天栽七、八分田，他也要栽五、六分田。社里把他评为小模范，上了光荣榜。有人还把他的事迹编了快板，到处传唱。
