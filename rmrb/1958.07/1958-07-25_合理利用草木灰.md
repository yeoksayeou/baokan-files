    Rational Utilization of Wood Ash
    In China, farm families mostly use stalks, weeds, branches, and the like as fuel, and the ash remaining after burning is called wood ash, also known as "small ash." For a long time, Chinese farmers have commonly used wood ash directly as fertilizer, which is an important source of potash in rural areas.
    After stalks, weeds, branches, and other plants are burned, the organic matter and nitrogen they contain are burned off. Therefore, wood ash does not contain organic matter or nitrogen, but only nutrients such as potassium, phosphorus, and calcium. Generally, one hundred catties of wood ash contains about five catties of potash fertilizer and two catties of phosphate fertilizer. Because wood ash contains more potash fertilizer, it is usually used as potash fertilizer. The potash fertilizer contained in wood ash is mainly potassium carbonate, which is soluble in water. When applied to the ground, it dissolves when it encounters moisture and can be absorbed and utilized by crops, with quick fertilizer effect. It is a fast-acting fertilizer. Therefore, wood ash can be applied directly without composting or processing.
    At present, some places use wood ash to process and refine potash fertilizer (potassium carbonate) as fertilizer. The method is to soak the wood ash in water to dissolve the potash fertilizer it contains in the water, and then boil, concentrate, and crystallize the soaked water solution to obtain potassium carbonate. It is not a problem that wood ash can be used to refine potassium carbonate, and potassium carbonate can be used as fertilizer. But this is unnecessary and uneconomical. Why? First of all, the potash fertilizer contained in wood ash is originally fast-acting, and refining potassium carbonate from wood ash does not accelerate its fertilizer effect. Therefore, the fertilizer effect of applying wood ash directly is the same as applying refined potassium carbonate. Second, although the fertilizer content of refined potassium carbonate is richer than that of wood ash, it is refined from a lot of wood ash, and the total fertilizer content has not increased. Third, in addition to potash fertilizer, wood ash also contains fertilizer such as phosphorus and calcium, but fertilizer such as phosphorus and calcium is not easily soluble in water. In this way, when refining wood ash, only potash fertilizer can be extracted, while fertilizer such as phosphorus and calcium remains in the residue and cannot be utilized. In short, using wood ash to refine potassium carbonate as fertilizer not only does not accelerate the fertilizer effect or increase the fertilizer content, but also causes loss of fertilizer and wastes some manpower and material resources.
    There are also some places that advocate dissolving wood ash in water first, and then applying the water solution and residue separately. It is said that the reason for doing this is to "increase" one fertilizer into two fertilizers. The water solution contains potash fertilizer and can be applied to crops that need potash fertilizer; the residue contains phosphate fertilizer and can be applied to crops that need phosphate fertilizer. This approach seems to divide one fertilizer into two, as if it has "increased" the fertilizer, but in reality, it has not truly increased any fertilizer. Crops need a supply of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium throughout their entire growth and development process. Although the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium needed varies in different crops and different growth and development stages of crops, this is only a matter of degree, not a matter of not needing them. In general, fertilizers should be used in combination, and there is no benefit to using them mechanically separately. It is actually unnecessary to divide wood ash into water solution and residue for application.

### 合理利用草木灰

    合理利用草木灰
    我国农家多数都用蒿秆、杂草、树枝等作燃料，燃烧后剩下的灰就叫做草木灰，也叫做小灰。长期以来，我国农民普遍直接利用草木灰作肥料，这是农村中重要的钾肥来源。
    蒿秆、杂草、树枝等植物体经过燃烧后，其中所含有机物和氮素都被烧掉，因此草木灰中不含有机物和氮素，只含有钾、磷、钙等养分。通常一百斤草木灰中约含有钾肥五斤，磷肥二斤。由于草木灰中钾肥含量较多，所以通常都把它当作钾肥来使用。草木灰含的钾肥主要是碳酸钾，它能溶解于水，施到地里遇上水分溶解后，即能供作物吸收利用，肥效快，是一种速效性的肥料。所以草木灰无须经过堆沤或加工处理，就可以直接施用。
    目前有些地方利用草木灰来加工提炼钾肥（碳酸钾）作为肥料。办法是用水浸淋草木灰，使它含的钾肥溶解于水里，然后将浸淋的水溶液熬煮浓缩、结晶，便得出碳酸钾。草木灰能够提炼出碳酸钾，而碳酸钾又能用作肥料，这是不成问题的。但是这样做是不必要的，也是不经济的。为什么呢？首先，草木灰含的钾肥本来就是速效的，用草木灰提炼碳酸钾并不能加速它的肥效。因此，直接施用草木灰与施用提炼出来的碳酸钾，肥效是一样的。第二，提炼出来的碳酸钾，肥分虽然比草木灰浓厚，但是，这是很多草木灰提炼出来的，总的肥分含量没有增加。第三，草木灰中除了含有钾肥外，还含有磷、钙等肥分，而磷、钙等肥分不易溶解于水。这样，提炼草木灰时，仅能将钾肥提取出来，磷、钙等肥分则遗留在残渣中，不能利用。总之，利用草木灰提炼碳酸钾作肥料，不仅不能加速肥效，增加肥分，而且会造成肥分的损失和浪费一些人力、物力。
    还有些地方提倡把草木灰先兑水溶解后，将水溶液与渣滓分别施用。据说所以这样做的理由，是可以使一种肥料“增加”为两种肥料，其水溶液含的是钾肥，可以施用在需要钾肥的作物；渣滓含的是磷肥，可以施用在需要磷肥的作物。这种做法，从表面上看是一种肥料分成为两种，好像是“增加”了肥料，实际上，并没有真正增加了什么肥料。农作物在整个生长发育过程中都需要氮、磷、钾等养分的供应，虽然在不同的作物和作物不同的生长发育阶段上需要氮、磷、钾的多少有所差异，但这只是程度上的问题，而不是不需要的问题。在一般情况下肥料应该配合使用，机械地分割使用没有好处。把草木灰兑水分成水溶液与渣滓施用，实际上是没有必要的。
