Xinhua News Agency report: According to Xinhua News Agency, many newspapers in the United States, Britain, and other Western countries have expressed serious concern and unease in their comments on the Middle East events. Many newspapers worry in their commentaries that the intervention of the United States and Britain in the Middle East will bring huge disasters. Some newspapers also criticized the bellicose attitude of the United States and Britain, urging them to adopt a sober policy.

    Armed Intervention Cannot Change the Course of History
    Some American Newspapers Mourn the Failure of Colonialism

The American Middle East affairs writer Alfred Lilienthal said that the United States sending troops to Lebanon was "a tragic mistake." He said: "The development of the situation in the Middle East requires Dulles to resign as Secretary of State immediately and adopt a new view of the Middle East. The United States must stop fighting against Arab nationalism or any other nationalism."

Some newspaper commentators also expressed unease about the actions of the U.S. government, worrying that this step would not only fail to reverse the situation in the Middle East, especially the course of events in Iraq, but would also lead to the opposite result. "The New York Times" commentator Baldwin pointed out in this regard: "The actions of the United States will not only fail to weaken, but will strengthen the power of Arab nationalism."

The Associated Press international news analyst Ryan, in a telegram from Athens on the 16th, admitted that the U.S. aggression against the Middle East cannot save the failure of colonialism. He sadly wrote: "Now, the Middle East is gradually being lost, and force is unlikely to stop this process."

Some American newspapers, in the face of undeniable facts, have had to admit that the Iraqi revolution is purely an internal affair of that country. "The New York Times," in an editorial on the Iraqi revolution, wrote: As historians have asserted, the modern world as a whole is undergoing a period of revolution, the most obvious example of which is the Middle East.

    军事冒险是自找灾难
    西方报纸担忧干涉行动后果
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息，美英两国和其它西方国家的很多报纸在评论中东事件时流露出严重的担忧和不安情绪。不少报纸在评论里担心，美英两国对中东的干涉行为会带来巨大的灾难。还有一些报纸抨击美英两国的好战态度，要求它们采取清醒的政策。
    武装干涉不能改变历史进程
    美国一些报纸为殖民主义的失败哀鸣
    美国的中东问题作家阿尔弗雷德·李连塞尔说，美国派兵到黎巴嫩去是“一个悲剧性的大错误”。他说：“中东的事态发展要求杜勒斯立即辞去国务卿的职务，并且对中东采取新看法。美国必须停止对阿拉伯民族主义或者任何其他民族主义作战。”
    一些报纸评论员也对美国政府的行动表示不安，担心这种步骤不仅不能扭转中东形势，特别是伊拉克事件的进程，而且会造成相反的结果。“纽约时报”评论员鲍德温就这一点指出：“美国的行动不仅不能削弱，而且结果还会加强阿拉伯民族主义的力量。”
    美联社国际新闻分析员瑞安在16日从雅典发出的一则电讯里承认，美国对中东的侵略行动并不能挽救殖民主义的失败。他悲哀地写道：“现在，中东正在逐渐失去，武力是不大能够阻止这种进程的。”
    有些美国报纸在确定不移的事实面前不得不承认：伊拉克革命纯粹是这个国家的内政。“纽约时报”在关于伊拉克革命的社论中写道：正如历史学家所断言的那样，现代整个世界正经历着一个革命的时期，这方面最明显的例子就是中东。
