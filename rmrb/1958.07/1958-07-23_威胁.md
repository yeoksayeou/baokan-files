    "Threat"
    Dong Fengya

    A British person from the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires dared to throw the protest letter from the teachers and students of Tsinghua University on the ground in front of the demonstrators. He even put on a pitiful look and said, "It's easy for you tens of thousands of people to threaten a few of us." This is utterly shameless. Tsinghua University Associate Professor Li Hengde said it well: "It is not we who are threatening you, but you who are threatening peace. We peace-loving people are protesting your acts of aggression! Since you know that there are few of you and many of us, you should immediately get out of Jordan. We also want to warn you that not only are there many of us in China, but there are many of us in the world, and few of you. And the number of you will become less and less, and the number of us will become more and more, do you understand?"

    This matter is not just funny; it contains a serious truth. The British person, under "threat," finally obediently picked up the letter again, not because he was afraid of the number of people, but because he was at a loss for words, and China is not a place where they can play rogue tactics at will. What would have happened ten years ago? After I returned home from the parade, my eighty-year-old grandfather asked me, "Did the British accept your protest letter obediently?" I said, "What else could he do if he didn't accept it?" He said, "In the past, they would have opened fire long ago."

    Indeed, there are many "threats" to imperialism in the world now. The development and strengthening of the socialist camp is a "threat" to them; the national liberation struggles of the colonial people are also a "threat" to them; even the peaceful economic growth of the Soviet Union and China is a "threat" to them. There are "direct threats" and "indirect threats" - didn't the US and Britain say that their dispatch of troops to Lebanon and Jordan was due to indirect threats? Thus, the anti-aggression demonstrations by the Chinese people can certainly be called a "face-to-face threat." Heavens, how can they endure all kinds of threats at all times, it's really "living in constant fear."

    In fact, this "threat" that the British are talking about is a special term in the imperialist dictionary. They call anything that hinders their aggressive behavior and exposes their conspiracies a threat. And because they are in the wrong, they always have to bow their heads under this threat. The British person dropping and then picking up the letter is one example; the Americans loudly proclaiming that they will not accept China's "threat of an ultimatum" in order to save face, but still expressing their willingness to send representatives for talks is another example. The 1956 demonstrations against the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt are probably still fresh in our minds. At that time, the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires closed its doors tightly, refusing to accept the protesters' protest letter, but the doors were finally pushed open by the demonstrators. A British person also said that the demonstrators were "a mess," and was similarly strongly refuted by the demonstrators, who accused them of making a real "mess" of their aggression against Egypt. As a result, the British Chargé d'Affaires, Humphrey Trevelyan, had to come out and publicly apologize to the demonstrators after accepting the protest letter, saying that his staff member "did not speak Chinese very well" and that his words were not well chosen. Please forgive him. This year, the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires did not dare to close its doors, but there are still people who come out to talk about "threats." What else can explain this besides shamelessness?

    If we are to talk about "threats," I think this is secondary. What is more important is the fist of the people of the world, the shooting with real guns and bullets. American troops in Korea, French troops in Vietnam, and later Anglo-French troops in Egypt have all been subjected to this kind of threat. Now American troops in Lebanon are also subjected to this kind of threat. However, this matter is also difficult to explain clearly, because it is indeed these aggressors who have traveled thousands of miles to offer themselves up to be "threatened," and before being threatened, they set fires, opened fire, and deprived others of their lives. Of course, in the end, it is imperialism that will be threatened, and the reasons are: first, justice is indeed on the side of the people of the world; second, indeed we - including the people of the world who oppose aggression - are much more numerous; and third, the most powerful weapons in the world are indeed in our hands and not in the hands of imperialism.

    Those who threaten others will inevitably be threatened in the end and go bankrupt. If Eden ended his career with "retirement" because of Britain's shameful failure in Egypt, then if Macmillan does not order the withdrawal of troops, I am afraid that "retirement" alone will not solve the problem.

### “威胁”

    “威胁”
    董逢亚
    英国代办处的一个英国人，竟敢在游行者面前，把清华大学师生们的抗议书丢弃在地上。他还装出一副可怜的样子说“你们几十万人，威胁我们几个人是很容易的事情。”这真是无赖透顶了。清华大学副教授李恒德说的好：“不是我们威胁你们，而是你们威胁了和平，我们爱好和平的人民抗议你们的侵略行为！你既然知道你们的人少，我们的人多，你们就应该立刻从约旦滚出去。我们还要正告你们，不仅在中国是我们的人多，在全世界还是我们的人多，你们的人很少，而且你们的人要越来越少，我们的人将越来越多，你们明白没有？”
    这件事不是好笑而已，其中包含有一个严肃的真理。英国人在“威胁”之下，终于又乖乖地把书信拾起来，并不是怕人多，而是由于他理屈词穷，而且中国这地方又不是他们随便能耍无赖的地方，退回十年去，看是如何？我游行后回到家里，八十多岁的老祖父问我，“你们的抗议书英国人就老老实实接受了吗？”我说“他不接受还怎么着？”他说“要是从前他们早开枪了”。
    的确，现在世界上对帝国主义的威胁特别多，社会主义阵营的发展壮大，对他们是“威胁”；殖民地人民的民族解放斗争，对他们又是“威胁”；甚至苏联和中国和平经济的增长，对他们也是“威胁”。有“直接的威胁”，还有“间接的威胁”——美英这次出兵黎巴嫩、约旦不就说是受到了间接威胁吗？如此，中国人民的反侵略游行示威，当然可以被说作是“面对面的威胁”了。苍天啊苍天，时时刻刻种种样样的威胁，如何能受得了，真是“惶惶不可终日”。
    其实，英国人所谓的这“威胁”，是帝国主义辞典里的专有名辞，他们把凡是妨碍着他们的侵略行为，而又揭破着他们的阴谋的东西，都称作是威胁，而他们由于理屈，又总是不得不在这威胁下低头。英国人丢了信又拾信是一个例子；美国人为了要面子，大嚷不接受中国“最后通谍的威胁”，但还是表示了要派代表会谈又是一个例子。1956年反对英法侵略埃及的游行，我们同英国人大概都还记忆犹新。那时，英国代办处紧闭大门，拒不接受游行者的抗议书，但大门终于被游行的人推开。一个英国人也曾说游行的人是“乱七八糟”，同样，遭到了游行者的严辞驳斥：指责他们对埃及的侵略才真正是“乱七八糟”的。结果是英国代办欧念儒不得不在接受了抗议书以后，又出来当众向游行的人们道歉，说是由于他的那位工作人员“不十分会说中国话”，造成了辞不达义。请大家原谅。今年的英国代办处大门是不敢关闭的了，但竟还有人出来谈什么“威胁”，除了恬不知耻以外，还能怎样解释呢？
    如果要讲“威胁”，我以为这还是其次。更重要的是世界人民的拳头，那真枪实弹的射击。美国军队在朝鲜，法国军队在越南，后来英法军队在埃及，都曾受到过这种威胁。现在美国军队在黎巴嫩又受到了这种威胁。不过这事情也很难说清楚，因为，它又确是这些侵略者们，千里迢迢送上门去让人家“威胁”的，而且在受到威胁之前，先就放起了火，开了枪，剥夺了别人的生命。当然，最终还是帝国主义要受到威胁的，那原因，第一正义的确在世界人民这边；第二，的确我们——包括全世界反对侵略的人民在内——人要多的多；第三，世界上最强大的武器的确又是在我们这边而不在帝国主义手里。
    去威胁别人的人，最后必然受到威胁而且要破产。如果说，艾登因英国在埃及遭到可耻的失败而以“退休”作结的话，那么轮到麦克米伦，如果不下令撤兵，恐怕只是“退休”就解决不了问题了。
