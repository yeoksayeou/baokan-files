In Malongya and Huilongjiao areas of Santai County, Sichuan, one can see a middle-aged woman leading five or six women picking wild herbs every day. Are they gathering pig feed? No, they are looking for raw materials for a local pesticide processing factory.

This woman is Huang Jingzhen, a well-known herbal medicine practitioner in Santai Chengguan. Although she is only thirty-six years old, she has been in the herbal medicine business for thirteen years. She can identify more than a hundred kinds of herbs. Whether it is a fragrant flower or a poisonous weed, as long as it falls into her hands, she always tries to make it serve humanity.

Based on her experience that boiling water with leaves of *mountain mahli* and *Vitex negundo* can cure infantile malnutrition and impetigo, she has provided the supply and marketing cooperative's production materials wholesale station with more than ten kinds of herbs that have strong toxicity and can kill crop pests. After being made into powder or liquid by the local pesticide processing factory, the insecticidal rate is above 80%.

Now she has been hired as a medicinal herb picking technician by the local pesticide processing factory. Who can say that she is a useless "quack doctor"?

    叫毒草为生产服务
    在四川三台县的马龙崖、回龙角一带，每天都可看见一个中年妇女，率领着五六个妇女，在那里采摘野草。她们是拾猪草吗？不是，她们在为土制农药加工厂寻找原料。
    这位妇女叫黄敬珍，是三台城关有名的草药先生。她虽然才三十六岁，做草药生意已十三年了，她能识别一百多种草药，不论是香花或毒草，只要落到她手里，总是想方设法让它为人类服务。
    她根据用山麻柳、黄荆叶熬水可以治疳疮、黄水疮的经验，向供销社生产资料批发站提供了十多种有较强毒性、可以杀农作物虫害的草药，经土制农药加工厂制成粉末或水剂，杀虫率都在80％以上。
    现在她已被聘为土制农药加工厂的采药技师，谁能说她是不中用的“江湖医生”呢？
