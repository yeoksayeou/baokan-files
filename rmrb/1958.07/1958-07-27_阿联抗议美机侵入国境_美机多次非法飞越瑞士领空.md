Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 25th – The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Republic, Hussein Aziz, summoned the American Ambassador to the United Arab Republic today to protest the issue of American planes flying over the Syrian region on the 24th.

　　Of the two American planes that intruded into the Syrian region on the 24th, one was hit by the anti-aircraft guns of the United Arab Republic and crashed within Lebanese territory.

　　Aziz also protested to the American Ambassador about the incident of American planes intercepting a civilian airliner of the United Arab Republic.

　　In the Suez Canal Zone, planes of unidentified nationality flew over at high altitude yesterday, and an air raid alarm was issued in the area.

　　Cairo held a thirty-minute air raid drill this morning, and air raid alarms were sounded. An official in charge of the Ministry of the Interior said that the purpose of the drill was to check the usage of all civil defense equipment in Cairo.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 26th – Geneva dispatch: The Swiss Federal Transport Office announced on the 25th that when the United States began transporting troops from West Germany in mid-July to intervene in Lebanon, the United States requested the Swiss government to allow thirty American troop transport planes to fly over Swiss airspace. The Swiss government rejected this request.

　　However, the United States, disregarding Switzerland's rejection, still rudely violated Swiss airspace. According to a report in a Geneva newspaper on the 24th, American military planes flying from American military bases in West Germany to the Middle East have violated Swiss airspace at least six times in the past week.
