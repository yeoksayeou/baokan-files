    Shanghai Secondary Schools Decide to Enroll Worker-Peasant Students Without Examination

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th. Shanghai's high schools and secondary normal schools have decided to adopt a recommendation and examination-free enrollment method for outstanding students with worker-peasant backgrounds in this year's enrollment work.

    Recommended students with worker-peasant backgrounds must love labor, have excellent political qualities, and have good health and academic performance. The number of recommended students will account for approximately 15% of the high school enrollment quota, approximately 50% of the secondary normal school enrollment quota, and 100% of the kindergarten normal school enrollment quota. This year, all schools will pay special attention to the assessment of political integrity in the standards for admitting general new students.

    Shanghai will enroll 35,000 high school students and approximately 27,000 secondary specialized school students this year. Through the combination of public and private schools, junior middle schools and primary schools can ensure that more than 340,000 school-age children and graduating senior primary school students are all enrolled.
