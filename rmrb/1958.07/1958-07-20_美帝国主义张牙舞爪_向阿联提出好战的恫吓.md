Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 19th: State Department spokesman White admitted on the evening of the 18th that the U.S. government had recently instructed the U.S. ambassador to the United Arab Republic, Hare, to issue bellicose threats to the United Arab Republic.

He said that Hare had recently issued a "verbal warning" to Sabri, the Minister of State for Presidential Affairs and Acting Foreign Minister of the United Arab Republic, stating: "It must be understood that if the military forces of the United Arab Republic or military forces under the control of the United Arab Republic launch an attack on the United States, it could have serious consequences that would greatly damage relations between our two countries." Hare also repeated Eisenhower's completely untenable excuses for the U.S. invasion of Lebanon.

Hare's blustering threats thoroughly expose the wolfish face of U.S. imperialism.

    美帝国主义张牙舞爪
    向阿联提出好战的恫吓
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人怀特在18日晚上承认，美国政府最近曾经指示美国驻阿拉伯联合共和国大使黑尔向阿拉伯联合共和国提出好战的恫吓。
    他说，黑尔最近向阿拉伯联合共和国负责总统事务的国务部长、代理外交部长萨布里提出“口头警告”说：“必须认清，如果阿拉伯联合共和国的军事部队或者受阿拉伯联合共和国控制的军事部队对美国发动攻击，那就有可能造成大大损害我们两国关系的严重后果。”黑尔同时还重复了艾森豪威尔提出的美国侵略黎巴嫩的那些完全站不住脚的借口。
    黑尔的虚声恫吓，彻底暴露了美帝国主义的豺狼面目。
