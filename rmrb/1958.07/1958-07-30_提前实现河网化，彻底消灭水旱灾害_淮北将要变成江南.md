Realizing River Network Construction Ahead of Schedule, Thoroughly Eliminating Drought and Flood Disasters
	Northern Anhui Will Become Like Jiangnan

	(Our Dispatch) Reporters Fú Jūn and Xiáng Rén report: After half a year of arduous struggle by the people of northern Anhui Province, about 40% of the 10 billion cubic meters of earthwork required by the overall plan for realizing river network construction in northern Anhui has been completed by the end of May. Now, the natural landscape of northern Anhui has begun to change.

	The realization of river network construction in northern Anhui is a major decisive battle between the 12 million people of northern Anhui and nature. For hundreds of years, northern Anhui has been a disaster-prone area. Although it has been governed many times in the past, the various natural disasters in northern Anhui have never been completely resolved. After liberation, the Huai River began to be harnessed, and farmland water conservancy projects were vigorously developed, which greatly reduced natural disasters. However, because some people's understanding of the characteristics of the northern Anhui area was not deep enough, they only paid attention to the governance of points and lines, and did not pay enough attention to the governance of the surface area. They only paid attention to building more drainage projects, and did not pay enough attention to water storage and irrigation projects. Therefore, although the northern Anhui area was spared certain flood disasters, drought and flood disasters have not yet been completely eliminated.

	Why is northern Anhui disaster-prone? According to the experience that the people of northern Anhui have gained in their long-term struggle against natural disasters, there are two main contradictions that have not been resolved. First, the northern Anhui plain is located in the middle reaches of the Huai River, with a large area, small riverbeds, flat terrain, and slow water flow. In addition, the northern Anhui water system was severely damaged before liberation, and the riverbeds were generally silted up and elevated. Therefore, varying degrees of waterlogging disasters occur every year. Second, the annual rainfall in northern Anhui is mainly concentrated in June, July, and August, and northern Anhui used to grow completely dry-land crops that could not withstand water. Once they encountered heavy rainfall of 300 to 400 millimeters, waterlogging disasters would occur. If most of the crops were changed to rice, then the rainfall would not be too much, but rather not enough.

	The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized these experiences and creations of the people of northern Anhui in their struggle against nature, carefully studied the characteristics of northern Anhui, and believed that: to completely change the disaster-prone face of northern Anhui, it is necessary to realize river network construction. The policy for realizing river network construction is: rely on the masses, believe in the masses, focus on small-scale projects, supported by large and medium-sized projects, focus on water storage, minimize drainage, river network construction, rice cultivation, and turn northern Anhui into Jiangnan. The requirements for realizing river network construction in northern Anhui are mainly to store the water from the sky (surface runoff formed by rainfall), block the water from outside (water coming from the upper reaches of the Huai River tributaries), and dig out the underground water, and make full use of these three water sources to change dry-land crops to rice and increase agricultural output. Of particular importance is the need to dig out underground water. If underground water cannot be dug out, it will be difficult to solve the problem of water sources for rice seedling cultivation and transplanting in northern Anhui. The total amount of the three water sources in the northern Anhui area is more than 15 billion cubic meters.

	According to the principles and requirements put forward by the Provincial Party Committee, the Huai River Harnessing Committee has initially drafted an overall plan for realizing river network construction in northern Anhui. The scale of this overall plan is very large. On the northern Anhui plain, in addition to further renovating the original 15 larger rivers, nine new rivers will be newly opened at the same time. These new rivers are interconnected and connected to the tributaries of the Huai River, such as the Ying River, the Wo River, the Tuo River, the Hui River, and the Si River, as main lines to form many large networks. In the middle of the large networks formed by many main lines, ditches are dug, ponds are dug, wells are drilled, and enclosures are built on a large scale, and springs are generally placed at the bottom of the ditches, ponds, and wells, so that the three are combined to form countless small networks. This makes the entire northern Anhui plain interconnected by ditches and connected by ponds, forming a huge water network. According to the overall plan, on all newly opened rivers and renovated existing rivers, and on all large, medium, and small ditches, a large number of control culverts and sluice gates will be built to block and store all the water from the sky, the water from outside, and the water dug out from the ground. The project of this overall plan is very arduous. The ditch alone requires the opening of 2,621 large ditches (30 to 50 meters wide at the top, 6 meters wide at the bottom, and 6 meters deep), 15,732 medium ditches (20 meters wide at the top, 4 meters wide at the bottom, and 5 meters deep), and 111,047 small ditches (10 meters wide at the top, 2 meters wide at the bottom, and 4 meters deep). The total length of the newly opened rivers and ditches is 125,000 kilometers. To realize river network construction in northern Anhui, a total of about 250,000 cubic meters of earthwork is required per square kilometer, and about 10 billion cubic meters of earthwork is required for the entire northern Anhui. After river network construction, the area of ditches and ponds will account for 5% to 8% of the land area, and 6% to 10% of the cultivated land area. By that time, northern Anhui will be able to avoid waterlogging disasters if it rains 400 millimeters in five days, and avoid drought disasters if it does not rain for 70 days. Of the more than 43 million mu of cultivated land in northern Anhui, 70% can be converted from dry land to paddy fields and planted with rice, and the other 30% of the cultivated land can also become irrigated land. In terms of shipping, the new and old rivers can respectively pass ships of 100 tons to 1,200 tons, and large, medium, and small ditches can pass wooden boats. Generally, it can be achieved that every county has access to ships, every township has access to wooden boats, and every commune has access to small wooden boats. In terms of power generation, it is initially planned to build 16 medium and small hydropower stations with a total installed capacity of 25,100 kilowatts and an annual power generation of 80 million kilowatt-hours. In terms of aquaculture, all ditches, ponds, and rivers will generally develop aquaculture industries such as fish farming.

	The overall plan for river network construction in northern Anhui has been transformed into the actions of the people. In order to realize this grand plan, the people of northern Anhui have been fighting hard for half a year since last winter, overcoming winter rain and snow, overcoming technical difficulties, and solving the problem of tools, making the water conservancy movement rise one high tide after another. By the end of May this year, more than 1,000 large ditches, more than 8,000 medium ditches, more than 90,000 small ditches, more than 70,000 ponds, more than 30,000 wells, more than 6,000 enclosures have been opened, and 58 large and medium-sized control gates and more than 8,200 small culverts and sluice gates have been built. Eighty-six townships and 582 agricultural cooperatives in northern Anhui have basically realized river network construction, accounting for about 10% of all townships and cooperatives in northern Anhui.

	In the fight against drought, the role of river network construction has been tested for the first time. Anhui Province has had little rainfall since the anti-drought wheat planting in October last year, especially after May this year, the drought has further developed. However, the northern Anhui region has played a significant role in completing the rice planting plan due to the implementation of construction and water storage at the same time, and vigorously excavating underground water sources. According to the statistics of 291 cooperatives in eight counties of the Bengbu Special Zone that have basically realized river network construction, the original plan was to convert 3.35 million mu of land to rice cultivation this year, and 1.3 million mu had been planted by June 26 before the rainfall. Local cadres and the masses are very proud to say, "With river network construction, we are not afraid of drought or flood."

    提前实现河网化，彻底消灭水旱灾害
    淮北将要变成江南
    本报讯　记者茀君、祥仁报道：安徽省淮北人民经过半年苦战，淮北实现河网化总规划要求做的一百亿公方工程，到5月底止已完成约40％。现在，淮北的自然面貌已开始改观。
    淮北实现河网化，这是淮北一千二百多万人民与大自然进行的一场大决战。几百年来，淮北一直是个多灾的地区。历代虽经多次治理，但是始终没有彻底解决淮北的各种自然灾害问题。解放以后，开始治理淮河，并大力兴办农田水利工程，自然灾害大大减轻。但是由于有些人对淮北地区的特点认识还不深刻，只注意点、线的治理，对面的治理重视不够，只注意多做排水工程，对蓄水灌溉工程重视不够，因此，淮北地区虽然免除了一定的洪水灾害，但是旱涝灾害仍未彻底消除。
    淮北为什么多灾？根据淮北人民长期与自然灾害斗争中摸出的经验，主要有两个矛盾没有解决。第一，淮北平原地处淮河中游，面积大，河床小，地势平坦，水流缓慢；加上淮北水系在解放前遭到严重破坏，河床普遍淤塞垫高，因此，每年都要发生程度不同的内涝灾害。第二，淮北每年的雨量主要集中在6、7、8三个月，而淮北过去完全种植旱粮作物，不能耐水，一遇到三、四百公厘的暴雨就发生涝灾。如果大部分改种水稻，那么雨水就不是太多，而是不够用。
    中共安徽省委总结了淮北人民与自然斗争的这些经验和创造，认真研究了淮北的特点，认为：要彻底改变淮北多灾的面貌，必须实现河网化。实现河网化的方针是：依靠群众，相信群众，小型为主，大中支持，以蓄为主，尽量少排，河网化，水稻化，把淮北变为江南。淮北实现河网化的要求，主要是装住天上的水（降雨形成的地上径流），拦住外来的水（淮河干支流上游的来水），并挖出地下的水，充分利用这三种水源，把旱粮作物改为水稻，提高农业产量。其中特别重要的是，要挖出地下水，如果不能挖出地下水，就很难解决淮北改种水稻育苗栽秧的水源问题。淮北地区三种水源总计有一百五十多亿公方。
    根据省委提出的方针和要求，治淮委员会已经初步拟出淮北实现河网化的总规划。这个总规划的规模非常宏大。在淮北平原，除了要进一步整修原有的十五条较大的河道以外，同时将新开九条新河。这些新河与颍河、涡河、沱河、浍河、濉河等淮河支流互相沟通连接起来，作为干线，组成很多大网。在许多干线组成的大网中间，再大规模地开沟、挖塘、打井、圈圩，并在沟、塘、井底普遍下泉，使沟、塘、井三者结合起来，组成无数小网。这样就使整个淮北平原沟沟相通，塘塘相连，形成一幅巨大的水网。按照总规划，在所有新开的河道和经过整修的原有河道之上，在所有大、中、小沟之上，都将大量建造节制涵闸，把天上的水、外来的水和从地下挖出来的水全部拦蓄起来。这个总规划的工程十分艰巨。仅仅沟渠一项，就要求开大沟（顶宽三十到五十公尺，底宽六公尺，深六公尺）二千六百二十一条，中沟
  （顶宽二十公尺，底宽四公尺，深五公尺）一万五千七百三十二条，小沟（顶宽十公尺，底宽二公尺，深四公尺）十一万一千零四十七条。新开河道和沟渠的总长度共达十二万五千公里。淮北实现河网化，总计要求每平方公里做土方二十五万公方左右，整个淮北要求共做土方约一百亿公方。河网化以后，沟塘的面积将占土地面积5％到8％，占耕地面积6％到10％。到那个时候，淮北地区五天降雨四百公厘可以不发生涝灾，七十天不下雨可以不发生旱灾。淮北四千三百多万亩耕地可有70％由旱地改为水田，改种水稻，另外30％的耕地也可以全部成为水浇地。在航运方面，新旧河道可以分别通行一百吨到一千二百吨的轮船，大、中、小沟可以通木船。一般可达到县县通轮船，乡乡通木船，社社通小木船。在发电方面，初步计划建造中小型水电站十六处，共装机容量二万五千一百瓩，年发电量八千万度。在水产方面，所有沟塘河道将普遍发展养鱼等水产事业。
    淮北河网化的总规划已经变成为人民的行动。为了实现这个宏伟的规划，淮北人民从去冬以来，连续苦战了半年，战胜了冬季雨雪，克服了技术困难，解决了工具问题，使水利运动一个高潮接着一个高潮。到今年5月底，已完成大沟一千多条，中沟八千多条，小沟九万多条，开塘七万多处，打井三万多眼，圈圩六千多处，建造大中型节制闸五十八座，小型涵闸八千二百多座。全淮北已有八十六个乡、五百八十二个农业社基本上实现了河网化，约占淮北所有乡社的10％。
    在抗旱斗争中，河网化的作用受到了初次考验。安徽省从去年10月抗旱种麦到现在很少降雨，特别是今年5月以后，旱情更加发展。但是淮北地区由于执行了边施工、边蓄水，并且大力挖掘地下水源，对完成水稻种植计划起了重大作用。据蚌埠专区八个县基本实现河网化的二百九十一个社统计，原计划今年改种水稻三百三十五万亩，到6月26日降雨前为止，已经栽植一百三十万亩。当地干部和群众非常自豪地说“有了河网化，旱涝都不怕”。
