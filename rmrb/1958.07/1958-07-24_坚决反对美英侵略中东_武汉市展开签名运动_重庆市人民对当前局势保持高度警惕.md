Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 23rd. The people of Wuhan, closely watching the development of the current situation in the Middle East, have been holding rallies every day in their spare time in recent days to denounce the aggressive actions of US-British imperialism. A signature campaign demanding that US-British aggressors get out of Lebanon and Jordan has also been launched in every corner of the city.

　　At various rallies, people cited many facts, pointing out that US-British imperialism is nothing but two paper tigers. Wang Zhihuai and Huang Shiyi, veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" General Strike in 1923 and the struggle to recover the British concession in Hankou in 1927, said that in 1927, the unarmed workers of Hankou once drove the British aggressors out of the British concession in Hankou, and by 1949, the Chinese people drove all imperialists out of mainland China at once. Under the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the just struggle of the Arab people will surely be victorious with the support of peace-loving people all over the world.

　　The workers and peasants of Wuhan, enraged by the aggressive acts of US-British imperialism, have proposed to work hard to increase production to strengthen the country's power to defend peace. After holding a rally, the steelworkers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation have advanced the completion date of the bricklaying project of No. 1 blast furnace, originally planned to be completed in seventy days, to sixty days.

　　Residents of various streets angrily condemned the aggressive actions of US-British imperialism at rallies, and expressed their firm support for the Arab people. After participating in a rally, military dependent Zou Yunqing immediately wrote a letter to her son, who is a pilot in the Air Force, instructing him to be vigilant, hold his weapon tightly, and step up training to prepare to defend the country's socialist construction and world peace.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd. The people of Chongqing are maintaining a high degree of vigilance regarding the current international situation.

　　More than 2,000 reading groups in factories, shops, and residential sections in the urban area are closely watching the reports on the Middle East situation every day. Currently, more than 80,000 people out of a total of more than 210,000 in the Beibei district have participated in various rallies. The workers and staff of tens of thousands of reading groups in industrial and mining enterprises throughout the city have also generally discussed the current situation. They have made various assessments of the development of the current situation and unanimously believe that if US-British imperialism dares to expand its aggression and continue to carry out war provocations without quickly withdrawing its invading troops from the Middle East, they will suffer a shameful end, because peace-loving countries and people have the power to stop their war adventures. Liao Shigang, a well-known labor model and milling worker at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, pointed out in his speech that British imperialism previously pursued a policy of aggression in the Middle East, and as a result, suffered a heavy blow in the Suez Canal incident. If US-British imperialism does not learn its lesson and expands the war in the Middle East, it cannot expect a better fate.

    坚决反对美英侵略中东
    武汉市展开签名运动
    重庆市人民对当前局势保持高度警惕
    新华社武汉23日电　密切注视着目前中东局势发展的武汉市人民，最近几天来每天都利用工余时间举行集会，声讨美英帝国主义的侵略行为。一个要求美英侵略者从黎巴嫩、约旦滚出去的签名运动，也已经在全市各个角落展开。
    人们在各种集会上，都列举许多事实，指出美英帝国主义不过是两只纸老虎。曾经参加过1923年“二七”大罢工和1927年收复汉口英国租界斗争的老工人王植槐、黄世一说，1927年，手无寸铁的汉口工人曾经把英国侵略者赶出了汉口英租界，到1949年，中国人民一下子就把所有帝国主义者都赶出了中国大陆。在东风已经压倒西风的形势下，阿拉伯人民的正义斗争在全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，一定会胜利。
    被美英帝国主义侵略行为激怒了的武汉市工人、农民们，纷纷提出要努力增加生产，以增强祖国保卫和平的力量。武钢工人在举行集会以后，筑炉工人已经把一号高炉原跃进计划七十天完成的砌砖工程提前到六十天完成。
    各街道居民在集会上愤怒地谴责美英帝国主义的侵略行为，纷纷表示坚决支持阿拉伯人民。军属邹云卿在参加集会以后，马上给自己在空军里当驾驶员的儿子写了一封信，嘱咐儿子提高警惕，紧握手中的武器，加紧锻炼，准备着保卫祖国社会主义建设，保卫世界和平。
    新华社重庆22日电　重庆市人民对当前的国际局势正保持着高度的警惕。
    市中区两千多个工厂、商店、居民段的读报组，每天都在密切地注视着有关中东局势的报道。共有二十一万多人的北碚区目前有八万多人参加了各种集会，全市工矿企业数以万计的读报组的职工也普遍讨论了当前的局势，他们对当前局势的发展作了各种估计，一致认为如果美英帝国主义胆敢扩大侵略、继续进行战争挑衅，不赶快将侵略军队撤出中东，它们就将遭到可耻的下场，因为爱好和平的国家和人民有力量来制止它们的战争冒险。著名的劳动模范、重庆建设机床厂铣工廖世刚在发言中指出，英帝国主义过去在中东推行侵略政策，结果在苏伊士运河事件中遭到了沉重的打击。如果美英帝国主义不接受教训，在中东扩大战争，它们不可能有更好的命运。
