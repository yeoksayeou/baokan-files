Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 26th -- Pakistan's gold, dollar, and pound reserves fell to their lowest point at the end of April this year, standing at 925.1 million rupees, due to a trade deficit of 31.2 million rupees during the month.

Pakistan's reserves have been declining year by year. In March 1956, the reserves amounted to 1.3481 billion rupees; in March of last year, they were 1.257 billion rupees; and in March of this year, the reserves fell to 956.3 million rupees, a total reduction of nearly 400 million rupees in two years.

Pakistan's trade deficit mainly arises from trade with Britain.

    巴基斯坦外汇储备
    四月底下降到最低点
    据新华社卡拉奇26日电　巴基斯坦今年4月底的黄金、美元和英镑储备额下降到最低点，为九亿二千五百一十万卢比，因为在这个月份巴基斯坦在对外贸易方面出现了逆差三千一百二十万卢比。
    巴基斯坦的储备额是逐年下降的。1956年3月的储备额为一十三亿四千八百一十万卢比，去年3月为一十二亿五千七百万卢比，今年3月的储备额降至九亿五千六百三十万卢比，两年之内一共减少了近四亿卢比。
    巴基斯坦的对外贸易逆差，主要产生于对英国的贸易。
