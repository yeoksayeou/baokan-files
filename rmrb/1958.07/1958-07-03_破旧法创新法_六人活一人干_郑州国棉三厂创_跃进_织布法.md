Breaking Old Methods and Creating New Ones: Six People's Work Done by One Person
Zhengzhou No. 3 State-Owned Cotton Mill Creates "Leap Forward" Weaving Method

(Our Newspaper dispatch) The workers of Zhengzhou No. 3 State-Owned Cotton Mill, with a daring and proactive communist spirit, boldly broke away from the "May First" weaving method and created a new "Leap Forward" weaving method, opening up a new chapter in the history of the textile industry.

The "May First" weaving method originally implemented in this factory focused on inspecting the cloth surface. The loom operator would patrol three times, twice to check the cloth surface and once to check the warp threads. At that time, under the system of dismantling substandard cloth, it played a significant role in improving cotton cloth quality and reducing waste cotton. With the abolition of the substandard cloth system, the original "May First" weaving method could no longer adapt to the new situation. Many workers reflected, "Now that substandard cloth is no longer dismantled, what is the use of checking the cloth surface?" Especially after seeing the news that Zhuang Meifang and other weaving workers at Xi'an No. 5 State-Owned Cotton Mill had expanded their machine tending capacity from 24 to 72 machines, they requested to change their operating methods and increase the number of machines they oversaw. At this time, the factory's Party and administrative leaders immediately convened a forum with weaving engineering technicians, advanced producers, and veteran workers to study and analyze the characteristics after substandard cloth was no longer dismantled. Based on the suggestion of weaving engineer Comrade Zhu Lantian, they decided to abolish the "May First" weaving method and create the "Leap Forward" weaving method, which is to establish stop-motion repair workers and warp inspection workers to be responsible for their respective tasks, in order to guarantee output and prevent defects. The "block-by-block" machine tending was changed to "strip-by-strip" machine tending to prevent workers from increasing their labor intensity. After this new working method was determined, it was tested on 780 automatic looms producing plain cloth and gabardine on June 17.

In the process of the experiment, the workers demonstrated a high degree of creativity. Workers Zhu Lianqing and Tao Jixian jointly created an automatic raising and lowering sign for stopped machines, allowing stop-motion repair workers to discover and handle them in a timely manner. Repair workers Yang Qixue, Si Julai, and others created a tracking patrol repair method, eliminating defects caused by mechanical malfunctions, which further ensured output and quality.

After five days of testing, it was proven that the "Leap Forward" weaving method had great advantages: Due to the improvement of labor organization and operating methods, the workers' machine tending capacity was greatly increased. Without increasing the labor intensity of the workers, the loom operators were changed to warp inspection workers, and their machine tending capacity increased from 24 to 264 machines. The auxiliary dismantlers were changed to stop-motion repair workers, and their machine tending capacity increased from 72 to 192 machines. On average, the work of six people in the past can now be completed by one person. After full implementation, the entire workshop can reduce the number of loom operators and auxiliary dismantlers by 345 people. The "Leap Forward" working method has a clear division of labor and implements the principle of preventing the generation of substandard cloth, reducing stop-motion time and improving product quality. The "Leap Forward" working method greatly simplifies the technical operation process for weaving workers. The loom operators, who originally needed to master the specifications of substandard cloth, inspect the cloth surface, handle stop-motions, and inspect the warp threads, are simplified to a single warp inspection task, providing favorable conditions for training workers quickly, efficiently, and economically.

Currently, this new weaving method is being fully promoted in the factory.

    破旧法创新法　六人活一人干
    郑州国棉三厂创“跃进”织布法
    本报讯　郑州国棉三厂的职工以敢想敢干的共产主义风格，大胆破除了“五一”织布工作法，创造了新的“跃进”织布工作法，为纺织工业开辟了新的历史。
    这个厂原来实行的“五一”织布工作法，重点是检查布面，挡车工每跑三次巡回：两次检查布面，一次检查经纱。当时在实行拆次布制度的情况下，对提高棉布质量，减少回丝，起了很大作用。随着拆次布制度的废除，原来的“五一”织布工作法已不能适应新的形势。许多工人反映：“不拆次布了，检查布面还有什么用呢？”尤其看到西安国棉五厂织布工人庄梅芳等看台能力由二十四台扩大到七十二台的消息后，纷纷要求改变操作方法，扩大看台数。这时，该厂党政领导立即召开了织布工程技术人员和先进生产者、老工人座谈会，研究分析不拆次布后的特点，根据织布工程师祝兰田同志的建议，决定废除“五一”织布工作法，创造了“跃进”织布工作法，即设立处理停台工和检查经纱工，分工负责，以保证产量，预防疵点；并改“块块”看台，为“条条”看台，预防工人增加劳动强度。这一新的工作法确定后，6月17日在平布和华达呢的七百八十台自动布机上进行了试验。
    在试验过程中，工人们发挥了高度的创造性。工人朱连卿和陶继先，共同创造了停车自动升降牌，让处理停台工能够及时发现，及时处理。修机工杨其学、司聚来等四人创造了跟踪巡回检修工作法，杜绝了因机械不良造成的疵点，这就使产量和质量进一步得到了保证。
    经过五天的试验，证明“跃进”织布工作法有很大的优越性：由于改进了劳动组织和操作方法，工人看台能力大大增加，在不增加工人劳动强度的条件下，挡车工改为检查经纱工后，看台能力由二十四台提高到二百六十四台，帮拆工改为处理停台工后，看台能力由七十二台提高到一百九十二台。平均以往六个人的工作，现在一个人即可完成。全部推广后，全车间可减少挡车和帮拆工人三百四十五名；“跃进”工作法分工明确，贯彻以预防次布产生为主，停台时间减少，使产品质量均有提高。“跃进”工作法大大简化了织布工人的技术操作过程，挡车工由原来需要掌握次布规格，检查布面，处理停台，检查经纱等多种技术，简化为单一的检查经纱工作，为多快好省地培训工人提供了有利条件。
    目前，这一新的织布工作法，正在该厂全面推广。
