    Overcoming the Difficulty of Labor Shortage in the Great Leap Forward of Agriculture
    Liberating Female Labor to Support Production
    Tianjin Prefecture Vigorously Develops Nursery Organizations, Implements Collective Sewing and Milling
    
    (Our Tianjin dispatch, July 7th, reporter Tang Ying) Under the slogan of “Liberating female labor, supporting the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production,” Tianjin Prefecture (formerly Cangxian Prefecture), Hebei Province, is vigorously carrying out a movement of mutual aid in childcare, and collectivization and mechanization of sewing and milling. At present, 91% of the children in the prefecture who should be in care have been placed in various childcare organizations; half of the counties, townships, and communes have also basically realized collective sewing and milling. Large numbers of female laborers have been liberated from household chores and投入 into the great torrent of production.
    
    In the Great Leap Forward in production, the farmers of Tianjin Prefecture, in order to ensure that the average yield of grain per mu in the entire prefecture reaches 400 jin this year, are vigorously building water conservancy projects and converting dry land into paddy fields. As a result, a serious shortage of labor has emerged. However, women, who account for nearly half of the labor force, are still living in the lifestyle of a small-scale peasant economy. Most women are unable to work or unable to work regularly because they are burdened by household chores such as milling flour for meals, making clothes and shoes, and taking care of children. In order to change this situation, in March of this year, the former Cangxian Prefectural Committee put forward the call to “Liberate female labor, support the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production,” which was enthusiastically responded to by women's federations at all levels and the broad masses of women. Women actively launched a movement of investing one yuan per person to build many milling factories named "March 8th" and "Women's" ; and established nurseries and children's teams. In many townships and communes, within less than ten days or half a month, large numbers of female laborers were投入 into the forefront of production.
    
    The childcare mutual aid, sewing, and milling organized in various places are mainly based on agricultural cooperatives and production teams. Childcare mutual aid is based on the principles of being conducive to production, voluntary participation by the masses, simplicity and ease of implementation, and running the facilities thriftily. The organizational forms include kindergartens, nurseries, children's teams, individual foster care, mutual assistance between relatives and neighbors, and field childcare groups where mothers take turns going to the fields. Sewing is divided into machine sewing and hand sewing, mainly responsible for sewing clothes and making shoes. At the same time, clothing and bedding dismantling and washing groups have also been established in various places. According to the current lack of machinery and power, grain processing mainly involves organizing the existing millstones and assigning dedicated personnel to push the mill. At present, more than 69,200 childcare organizations, 949 machine sewing groups, more than 1,700 hand sewing groups, and more than 4,200 milling groups have been established throughout the prefecture, freeing up approximately 300,000 full and part-time female laborers (including women who do not regularly participate in labor) to participate in production.
    
    The women, liberated from household chores, are able to concentrate on production without worries because someone is taking care of their children, someone is managing the milling, and someone is sewing their clothes, becoming a new force in the Great Leap Forward in production. Their slogan is: "What men can do, women can also do, and we are determined to surpass men." More than 500 women in Fengxiang Township, Nanpi County, who were投入 into water conservancy construction, worked with male commune members to dig 1,292 brick wells and 24 earthen wells in ten days. In Da Wu Pan Village, Yingzi Township, Jiahe County, the attendance rate of women reached 100%. Although the village transferred a group of laborers to support the reclamation of Huanghua, it was still able to complete the production tasks of drought resistance, sowing, and wheat watering ahead of schedule and on time.
    
    As women participated in field production and increased family income, new changes have taken place in husband-wife relations and mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relations, fundamentally resolving the issue of gender inequality. Many couples and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law who had long-term conflicts have now reconciled, and a new trend of husbands praising wives, mothers-in-law praising daughters-in-law, and everyone respecting women has emerged. Wang Xishun, a commune member in Xiaoliu Baozhu Village, Gaochuan Township, Cang County, has four children, and his wife was unable to work in the fields because of them. The family of six relied entirely on him for a living. Therefore, life was very difficult, and the couple often quarreled and fought. Now, after sending the two youngest children to the children's team and kindergarten, his wife has participated in field production and is working well. The couple earns thirteen or fourteen work points a day, in addition to paying the nanny's work points, and their lives have improved, and the couple is also harmonious.
    
    After getting rid of the household chores that had tied them down, the number of women studying culture and technology has increased. According to statistics, the number of women in the prefecture participating in cultural and technical studies in people's schools has reached more than 355,000, an increase of more than 110,000 compared to last year. Women not only study culture and technology in classrooms in the morning and evening, but also carry a literacy textbook with them when they go to the fields, using their rest time to gather in groups of two or three in the fields to learn literacy. Many women have learned two or three hundred characters in a month.
    
    In addition, most of the childcare mutual aid, milling, sewing, and dismantling and washing groups organized in various parts of Tianjin Prefecture are staffed by the elderly, widowed, five-guarantee households, and the weak and disabled. In this way, non-laborers and auxiliary laborers in rural areas also have suitable jobs, everyone has work to do, everyone is not idle, and each person can earn an average of four or five work points, greatly reducing the burden on agricultural cooperatives and society.

### 攻破农业跃进中劳力不足的难关  解放妇女劳动力支援生产  天津专区大办托儿组织，实行集体缝纫和磨面

    攻破农业跃进中劳力不足的难关
    解放妇女劳动力支援生产
    天津专区大办托儿组织，实行集体缝纫和磨面
    本报天津7日电  记者唐荧报道：在“解放妇女劳动力，支援农业生产大跃进”的口号下，河北省天津专区（原沧县专区）正在轰轰烈烈地开展一个托儿互助化，缝纫、磨面集体化和机械化的运动。目前全专区91％的应托幼儿已托入各种托儿组织；有一半的县、乡、社也基本实现了集体缝纫和磨面。广大妇女劳动力纷纷从家务劳动中解放出来，投入了生产的大洪流中。
    在生产大跃进中的天津专区的农民，为了保证今年实现全专区平均亩产粮食四百斤，大兴水利，大改旱地为稻田。因此，出现了劳动力不足的严重情况。可是占劳动力近一半的妇女，由于仍然过着小农经济的生活方式，大部分妇女为吃饭磨面、穿衣做鞋和看孩子等家务事的牵累不能出勤或不能经常出勤。为了改变这种情况，今年3月间，原沧县地委提出了“解放妇女劳动力，支援农业生产大跃进”的号召，各级妇联组织和广大妇女群众热烈响应。妇女们积极地开展了一人投资一元钱的运动，兴建了许许多以“三八号”、“妇女号”命名的磨面加工厂；建立了托儿所和幼儿队。许多乡、社在不到十天或半月的时间内，就有大批妇女劳动力投入生产的最前线。
    各地举办的托儿互助、缝纫、磨面，主要是以农业社和生产队为单位。托儿互助是本着有利于生产、群众自愿、简便易行和勤俭办所的原则，组织形式有幼儿园、托儿所、幼儿队、个别寄托和亲邻相帮、母亲轮流下地生产和田间托儿组等。缝纫分机器缝纫和手工缝纫，主要担负缝衣和做鞋，同时，各地还建立了拆洗衣服、被褥组。粮食加工根据目前机器和动力缺乏的情况，主要是将原有的磨盘组织起来，固定专人推磨。现在，全专区已建立六万九千二百多个托儿组织，九百四十九个机器缝纫组，一千七百多个手工缝纫组，四千二百多个磨面组，共腾出约三十万个整半妇女劳力（包括不经常参加劳动的妇女）参加生产。
    从家务劳动中解放出来的妇女们，由于孩子有人看，磨面有人管，衣服有人缝，都无牵挂地安心生产，成为生产大跃进中一支新的生力军。她们的口号是：“男的能干妇女也能干，坚决赛过男子汉”。南皮县凤翔乡五百多名投入水利建设的妇女，同男社员一起用十天的功夫，就打砖井一千二百九十二眼和土井二十四眼。交河县营子乡大吴潘村的妇女出勤率达到百分之百。虽然这个村抽调了一部民工支援黄骅垦荒，仍能够提前和按时完成抗旱播种、小麦浇水等生产任务。
    妇女们参加了田间生产，增加了家庭收入，夫妇关系、婆媳关系起了新的变化，从根本上解决了男女不平等的问题。过去许多长期闹夫妇关系、婆媳关系不和的，现在都和睦了，出现了丈夫夸妻、婆婆夸媳妇、人人尊敬妇女的新风尚。沧县高川乡小留保住村社员王希顺，有四个小孩，妻子因此不能下地生产，一家六口人，全靠他一人生活。因此，生活很困难，两口子经常吵嘴打架。现在，把最小的两个孩子送入了幼儿队和幼儿园以后，妻子参加了田间生产，劳动又好，两口子一天挣得的工分，除了付给保姆工分以外，还剩下十三、四个工分，日子过好了，夫妻也和睦了。
    摆脱了缠住手脚的家务以后，妇女们学习文化和技术的人数越来越多。据统计，目前全专区妇女参加民校学习文化和技术的人数达到三十五万五千多人，比去年增加了十一万多人。妇女们不仅早晚在课堂学习文化和技术，而且下地时还带着一本识字课本，利用休息时间在地头三三两两围在一起学习识字。许多妇女在一个月内，就认识单字二、三百个。
    此外，天津专区各地组织的托儿互助、磨面、缝纫和拆洗组，大部分由老头、老婆、五保户、身弱体残的人来担任。这样，就使农村非劳动力和辅助劳动力也有了合适的工作，人人有活干，人人不吃闲饭，每人平均可以挣得四、五个工分，大大地减轻了农业社和社会的负担。（附图片）
