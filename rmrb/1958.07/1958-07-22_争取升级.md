Strive for Upgrading
　　Wang Pu

The new situation of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture has presented us with many new tasks, one of which is to increase the production of mechanical equipment. The current situation is this: If the machinery manufacturing industry does not develop rapidly, the entire industrial construction will not advance at high speed, and many magnificent construction plans will not be realized quickly. Therefore, after the situation of taking steel as the key link and the whole people running iron and steel industry appeared, grasping the machinery industry and trying every means to increase the machinery manufacturing capacity has become a very important issue at present.

To increase machinery manufacturing capacity and make it truly the core of the technological revolution, the most fundamental way is to build a new batch of factories. However, this takes a certain amount of time and cannot be done all at once. At present, there is another way that is more, faster, better, and more economical, which is to upgrade existing machine repair factories into manufacturing factories, and to upgrade repair workshops into manufacturing workshops. Some people may say, how much "gravy" is there in this? Then please read the statement published in today's newspaper by the person in charge of the Ministry of Railways on the contracting of major and medium repairs of locomotives by employees of the Tianjin and other eight locomotive depots! He said that if next year all medium repairs of locomotives and half of the major repairs of locomotives nationwide are contracted by employees of the transportation departments, then repair factories can repair 1,300 fewer locomotives. Repair factories can use this time to manufacture 600 to 700 locomotives, which is more than double the national locomotive production this year. Of course, the ratio of repair capacity to manufacturing capacity in other mechanical industries will not be the same as that in the railway locomotive sector, but it is certain that the manufacturing potential of repair factories and repair workshops is great.

To upgrade repair factories into manufacturing factories and repair workshops into manufacturing workshops, two hurdles must be overcome. One is that machine operators learn repair techniques, take on as many machine repair tasks as possible, and reduce the number of full-time repair workers to a minimum. The second is that machine repair workers learn machine manufacturing techniques. In today's popular parlance, it is learning to be a "jack-of-all-trades." Today's newspaper published the news that the four locomotive depots and five vehicle depots of the Beijing Railway Administration are repairing locomotives and vehicles themselves, and the news published in this newspaper some time ago about the "jack-of-all-trades" movement being carried out in various places, both prove that it is not difficult for transportation workers to learn repair techniques. As for repair workers learning manufacturing techniques, it is even easier. Because repair and manufacturing are not completely separate. People who are familiar with repair techniques can not only easily learn manufacturing techniques, but also because they repair many types of machines and understand the performance and advantages and disadvantages of various brands of machines, they can also learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses when it comes to manufacturing. One piece of evidence is that in this year's Great Leap Forward, many machine repair factories produced tractors, and many automobile repair factories produced automobiles.

It is indeed not new for transportation workers to learn repairs and repair workers to learn manufacturing, but it has not been universally promoted. There are many reasons why it has not been universally promoted, one of which is that some cadres and transportation workers are afraid that learning repair techniques will hinder the improvement of professional skills. In fact, this concern is superfluous. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Understanding the overall situation makes it easier to use the local situation." (Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War). This is true for commanding battles, and it is also true for operating machines. By repairing machines, transportation workers can better understand the structural principles of machines and the performance of various parts, and thus can better be the masters of the machines and better carry out technological innovation.

Now, the people of the whole country are going all out and striving for the top. We hope that machine (including automobile, tractor, and train) operators will take learning repair techniques, and repair workers will take learning manufacturing techniques as one of the criteria for striving for the top, and strive to maximize the upgrading of existing repair factories into manufacturing factories and repair workshops into manufacturing workshops!

    争取升级
    王朴
    工农业大跃进的新形势，给我们提出了许多新任务，其中一个叫做增加机械设备的生产。当前的情况是这样：机械制造工业如不迅速发展，整个工业建设就不能高速度地前进，许多宏伟的建设计划就不能迅速实现。所以，当以钢为纲，全民大办钢铁工业的形势出现以后，抓机械工业，千方百计地增加机械制造能力，就成为当前一个十分重要的课题了。
    增加机械制造能力，使它真正成为技术革命的核心，最根本的办法是建设一批新工厂。但这需要一定的时间，不是一下子就能做到的。在目前，还有一个又多又快又好又省的办法，就是把现在的机械修理工厂升格为制造工厂，把修理车间升格为制造车间。也许有人说，这有多大“油水”呢？那就请看今天本报刊登的铁道部负责人就天津等八个机务段职工承包机车的大修理和中修理事情，发表的谈话吧！他说，明年，要是全国铁路所有机车的中修和一半机车的大修任务，都由运转部门职工包下来，那末，就可以使修理工厂少修理一千三百台机车，修理工厂利用这些时间可以制造六百至七百台机车，比今年全国的机车产量多一倍。当然，其它机械工业的修理能力与制造能力的比例，不会像铁路机车部门一样，但修理工厂和修理车间的制造潜力很大却是可以肯定的。
    把修理工厂升格为制造工厂，把修理车间升格为制造车间，要过两道关。一是机器运转工人学会修理技术，把机器的修理任务尽量担当下来，把专职的修理工人减到最低限度。二是机器修理工人学会机器制造技术。用现在流行的话来说，就是学习“多面手”。今天本报发表的北京铁路管理局四个机务段和五个车辆段自己修理机车和车辆的消息，以及前些时候本报发表的各地开展“多面手”运动的消息，都证明了运转工人学会修理技术并不困难。至于修理工人学会制造技术，尤其容易。因为修理和制造，本来就不是截然分开的。熟悉修理技术的人，不仅很容易学会制造技术，而且因为修理的机器种类多，懂得各种牌号机器的性能和优缺点，搞起制造来，还可以取长补短。证据之一就是，在今年的大跃进中，很多机械修理工厂造出了拖拉机，许多汽车修理工厂造出了汽车。
    运转工人学修理，修理工人学制造，的确已经不是新鲜事儿，只是没有普遍推行罢了。没有普遍推行的原因很多，其中一个是有些干部和运转工人怕学习修理技术以后妨碍专业技术的提高。其实，这种顾虑是多余的。毛泽东同志说过：懂得了全局性的东西，就更会使用局部性的东西（中国革命战争的战略问题）。指挥打仗是这样，操纵机器也是这样。运转工人通过修理机器，就可以更加懂得机器的构造原理和各种机件的性能，因而就可以更好地做机器的主人，更好地搞技术革新。
    现在，全国人民都在鼓足干劲，力争上游。我们希望机器（包括汽车、拖拉机和火车在内）运转工人把学会修理技术，修理工人把学会制造技术作为争上游的标准之一，为最大限度地把现有的修理工厂升格为制造工厂，把修理车间升格为制造车间而努力！
