    Promote the Great Development of the Technological Revolution
    Sichuan Launches Mass Technological Fact-Finding Campaign

    (Our newspaper dispatch) Sichuan Province is currently carrying out a mass "technological fact-finding" activity to summarize and promote the advanced production experiences of workers and peasants, as well as their various inventions and creations in the technological revolution, in order to promote the development of the technological revolution.

    Suining County collected more than 160 agricultural inventions and creations and more than 320 industrial inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals in just over a month. These inventions and creations include new-style farm tools for cultivating and weeding, homemade pesticides, homemade cranes, wooden scales, and more. They also discovered that farmers in Sanlian Township created the experience of harvesting grain and bean crops nine times a year and are preparing to help farmers systematically summarize this. Members of the Science Popularization Association of the Luxian Agricultural Experiment Station summarized and promoted more than ten advanced experiences, such as "floating seedling cultivation" and "five uses for ponds and weirs," during the technological fact-finding activity. The "five uses for ponds and weirs (fish farming, lotus root cultivation, seedling cultivation, fodder planting, water storage)" alone, when promoted in Luxian County, can increase production equivalent to 24 million catties of grain.

    This mass "technological fact-finding" activity was initiated by the Sichuan Provincial Association for Science and Technology Popularization. More than 25,000 members of the 58 county and city branches of the Association for Science and Technology Popularization across the province are the backbone force in carrying out the fact-finding activity. The main content collected by various places during the "technological fact-finding" activity includes the inventions and creations of workers and peasants in factory and mine technological innovation and rural tool reform, cultivation system reform, etc.; advanced experiences in agricultural and sideline production; folk medicine prescriptions; materials on local specialties, improved varieties of crops, and diseases and pests; and the deeds of advanced figures in industrial and agricultural production. Wenjiang, Nanchong, and other counties and cities have decided to focus on collecting and summarizing the experiences of the masses in homemade pesticides and chemical fertilizers, etc., based on the main problems in current agricultural production, such as fertilizer shortage and severe rice blast.

    Under the leadership of local Party committees, many places have adopted the following two methods in carrying out the "technological fact-finding" activity. On the one hand, they organize scientific and technological workers to go deep into factories, mines, and rural areas, doing everything possible to help the masses carry out technological innovation and promptly summarize and scientifically appraise the advanced experiences of the masses. On the other hand, they rely on relevant business departments to mobilize the masses to report and collect all kinds of new things and past traditional experiences that have emerged in technological innovation.

    In the "technological fact-finding" activity, many places have paid attention to collecting, appraising, and promoting simultaneously. After collecting and helping the masses create more than 120 kinds of homemade chemical fertilizer methods, the Nanchong City Branch of the Science Popularization Association has collaborated with relevant departments to run two training classes, helping more than 200 agricultural cooperative cadres learn more than 30 kinds of homemade chemical fertilizer methods.

    促进技术革命大发展
    四川发起群众性的技术采风
    本报讯  四川省正在开展一个群众性的“技术采风”活动，总结和推广工农群众的先进生产经验和他们在技术革命中的各种创造发明，促进技术革命的开展。
    遂宁县在一个多月中采集到的农业方面的发明创造一百六十多种，工业方面的发明创造和合理化建议三百二十多件。在这些创造发明中，有中耕、除草用的新式农具、土制农药、土制起重机、木制磅秤等。他们还发现三联乡农民创造了粮食和豆类作物一年九熟的经验，准备帮助农民进行系统总结。泸县农业试验站的科普协会会员在技术采风活动中，总结和推广了“水上育秧”、“塘堰五用”等十多项先进经验。其中仅“塘堰五用（养鱼、种藕、育秧、种饲料、蓄水）”一项，在泸县推广，就可增产相当二千四百万斤粮食的财富。
    这个群众性的“技术采风”活动，是四川省科学技术普及协会发起的。全省有五十八个县、市的科普协会支会二万五千多名会员，是开展采风活动的骨干力量。在“技术采风”活动中，各地采集的主要内容是工、农群众在厂、矿技术革新和农村工具改革、耕作制度改革等方面的发明创造，农、副业生产中的先进经验，民间医药秘方；各地土、特产品、农作物良种、病虫害方面的资料以及工、农业生产中先进人物的事迹等。温江、南充等县、市并根据当前农业生产上肥料缺乏、稻瘟病严重等主要问题，决定着重采集和总结群众中土制农药和化学肥料等方面的经验。
    在各地党委领导下，许多地方开展“技术采风”活动，都采用了以下两种办法。一方面，组织科学技术工作者深入厂矿、农村，千方百计地帮助群众进行技术革新，及时对群众的先进经验进行总结和科学的鉴定。另一方面，依靠各有关业务部门，发动群众报告和采集技术革新中出现的种种新事物和过去的传统经验。
    在“技术采风”活动中，许多地方都注意边采集、边鉴定、边推广。南充市科普协会支会在采集和帮助群众创造了一百二十多种制造化学肥料的土办法后，已协同有关部门开办了两个训练班，帮助二百多名农业社干部学会了三十多种制造化学肥料的土办法。
