    Imagining the Future of Drama
    Shu Nan
    I was very excited to see the performances of two new plays by the veteran playwright Comrade Tian Han, "Guan Hanqing" and "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir," in one week. In particular, the performance of "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir" was written and rehearsed by the writer and theater in a fighting posture within two weeks. Comrade Tian Han's plays are full of revolutionary optimism and romantic imagination. What made the writer so excited? What prompted the writer to "finish writing the final scene in three or five sleepless or short-sleeping nights"? In Comrade Tian Han's own words, it is: the unparalleled socialist vigor of the 400,000 heroic people who built the Ming Tombs Reservoir, symbolizing the Chinese people. At the same time, the audience can also feel the enthusiasm of the directors, actors, art designers, and several composers, as well as all the staff of the China Youth Art Theater who participated in the performance of this play, and their desire to express the enthusiasm of the working people of our great era.
    The magnificent scene of 400,000 voluntary laborers in the capital building the Ming Tombs Reservoir, working day and night in an endless stream. They came from all corners, including workers, peasants, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, government cadres, school teachers and students, commercial workers, literary and art workers, religious believers, and residents, as well as respectable international friends. Among these people, countless labor models and creative deeds emerged. How to broadly and deeply reflect this major theme with international significance is indeed a matter of concern. The author runs through the entire play with a cultural tour group's visit to the construction site to express their regards, and depicts the demeanor of heroes from all walks of life in a comprehensive and broad manner. There are more than 30 named characters touched upon in the play, among which the more emphasized depictions are the female labor model Sun Shulan, the old Red Army soldier Chen Peiyuan, the head of the tour group Guo, the historian Professor Jian, Professor Huang Zhongyun, and the young writer Hu Jintang, whose soul is filthy. Through the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, this socialist labor university furnace, the script reflects the true colors of various intellectuals. Historians like Professor Jian, who are willing to transform their thinking through labor, can step out of the pile of books and historical materials, connect with reality, and recognize the greatness of today's working people; while Professor Huang Zhongyun, who is bent on holding his son back and refusing to reform, will inevitably fall behind the times even after twenty years. The author uses "Qin Xianglian" and "Chen Shimei" to compare Sun Shulan and Hu Jintang, making them a clear contrast between two kinds of people with noble character and decadent degeneration in the new society; in the play, the author only spent a few strokes to portray Hu Jintang, such a human scum. The poems recited by Group Leader Guo on the flood control dam with great enthusiasm, praising socialist construction, express the voice of the broad masses of people.
    I especially like the final scene of reminiscing about the construction of the reservoir on the flood control dam twenty years later. This scene expresses the audience's imagination of a communist society. Thanks to the art designers for depicting the prosperous scene of colorful flowers on the flood control dam twenty years later for the audience; people living in such an era and such an environment can do even greater things. The backdrop of the entire play uses a huge Chinese landscape painting, which also adds to the magnificent atmosphere of the construction site for the entire performance.
    "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir" is a play that praises today and imagines the future. The performance of this play inherits and develops the fighting tradition of spoken drama. The playwright's creative enthusiasm is like the never-fading revolutionary enthusiasm that we see in the old Red Army soldier Chen Peiyuan in the play. Chen Peiyuan is sixty years old today and has silver hair; but after twenty years, his white hair has all turned black, which shows the playwright's vigorous vitality and yearning for communism.

    畅想未来的戏剧
    舒楠
    我非常兴奋地在一星期中看到老戏剧家田汉同志的“关汉卿”和“十三陵水库畅想曲”两出新戏的演出。特别是“十三陵水库畅想曲”的演出，是作家和剧院在两星期内以战斗的姿态边写、边排出来的。田汉同志的剧作中洋溢着革命的乐观主义精神，充满了浪漫主义的想像。是什么使得作家如此激动？是什么推动了作家在“三五个不眠或少眠的晚上把最后一场写完了”？用田汉同志自己的话来说，就是：修建十三陵水库四十万英雄人民所象征的中国人民无比的社会主义干劲。同时，观众也能感受到中国青年艺术剧院参加这出戏演出的导演、演员、美术设计和几位作曲家，以及所有工作人员的干劲，和要表现出我们这个伟大时代劳动人民的热情。
    修建十三陵水库的首都四十万个义务劳动者，不分昼夜、穿流不息地紧张劳动的宏伟场景。他们来自各个角落，有工人、农民、解放军官兵、机关干部、学校师生、商业工作人员、文艺工作者、宗教徒和居民，还有可尊敬的国际友人，这些人中间出现了数不清、说不完的劳动模范和创造事迹。要怎样才能宽阔和深入地反映这个富有国际意义的重大题材，的确是引人关心的问题。作者通过一个文化参观团到工地的慰问活动，贯穿全剧，纵横宽广地描写了各路英雄人物的风貌。全剧触笔的有名有姓的人物有三十多人，其中比较着重描写的是女劳模孙淑兰、老红军陈培元、参观团郭团长、历史家简教授、教授黄仲云，和那个脏透了灵魂的青年作家胡锦堂等形象。剧本透过十三陵水库工地这所社会主义劳动大学洪炉，反映了各种知识分子的本来面目。像简教授那样愿意在劳动中改造思想的历史家，就能从书堆史料中走出来联系实际，认识今天的劳动人民的伟大；而那个一心要拉儿子后腿、拒绝改造的黄仲云教授，二十年后仍不免落在时代的后面。作者用“秦香莲”和“陈世美”来比喻孙淑兰和胡锦堂，使他们成为新社会中具有高尚品格和腐朽堕落两种人的鲜明对比；剧中，作者只不过花了几笔，就把胡锦堂这样一个人类渣滓刻划出来了。郭团长热情充沛地在拦洪坝上朗诵的歌颂社会主义建设的诗篇，正表达了广大人民的心声。
    我特别喜欢二十年后拦洪坝上回忆修建水库情景这末一场戏。这场戏抒发了观众对于共产主义社会的想像。感谢美术设计者为观众所描绘出来的、二十年后拦洪坝上万紫千红的繁荣气象；人们生活在那样的时代、那样的环境，就能做出更加伟大的事业。全剧的背景采用了巨幅的中国山水画，也使整个戏的演出增添了工地的宏伟气氛。
    “十三陵水库畅想曲”是一出歌颂今天，畅想未来的戏剧。这出戏的演出，继承和发扬了话剧的战斗传统。剧作家这种创作热情，就像我们从剧中老红军陈培元身上所看到的永不衰退的革命热情。六十岁的陈培元，今天是银丝白发；二十年后白发却全变成乌头，这正显露了剧作家旺盛的生命力和向往共产主义的心情。
