Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: A grand Guangdong folk song concert was held in Guangzhou on the evenings of July 1st and 2nd. More than sixty folk singers from all over the province performed more than ninety wonderful folk songs. These songs, with their rich local flavor, sang the praises of the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and sang the praises of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, which made the audience feel excited and encouraged.

Zhou Shicai, a famous singer from Fangcheng County who is over sixty years old, has created more than 4,000 folk songs in connection with various political movements. He usually sings about whatever he sees. When he came to Guangzhou this time, the rural areas were in the midst of the summer harvest, so he sang about his hometown and sang about the harvest at the meeting: The summer sky is really clear and refreshing, the sunshine shines on the yellow fields, the farmers are happy to see it, repairing the threshing floor (a place for drying grains) and mending the granary. The early rice fought hard and bore fruit, men and women, young and old, are busy with the summer harvest, carrying back the rice to fill the hall, and threshing the grain to release golden light. The collectivization is of great significance, improving life day by day, more work, more pay, good distribution, abundant food and clothing, and a happy life. Every family is embarking on advanced collectivization, distributing rations in accordance with the policy, and thanking Chairman Mao for the harvest, just like seeing a red flower in the sun.

Women from the fishing village of Pinghai in Huiyang Prefecture like to sit on boats and sing while fishing. This time, two women from the fishing village sang "Singing the General Line", they sang: Golden flowers and silver flowers everyone loves, socialism everyone seeks, for the mechanization of the fishery, Pinghai fishermen strive to go upstream. Today, the fishermen are very different, and they are the vanguards of production and construction. The whole commune uses nylon nets, and wooden boats become large motor sailboats.

Lu Ji, chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, and Lian Kang, executive editor of "People's Music", spoke highly of the concert. Lu Ji said that holding such a folk song concert is the first time in the country. It has a strong local flavor and vividly reflects the heroic spirit of the socialist Great Leap Forward and the high degree of socialist enthusiasm. Lu Ji said that such concerts should be promoted in the future, and holding such concerts extensively will greatly enrich the musical life of the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th: The Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Writers Association and the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Musicians Association decided on the 4th to admit a group of amateur worker-peasant writers and folk singers as members.

The new members admitted by the Guangzhou Branch of the Writers Association include Zhao Yalian, a Yao ethnic female township head, Liu Yiliang, a transportation worker, Chen Xianying, a worker, Zhang Hanxing, a mechanical worker, and old peasants Zhou Shicai and Wu Fengying.
