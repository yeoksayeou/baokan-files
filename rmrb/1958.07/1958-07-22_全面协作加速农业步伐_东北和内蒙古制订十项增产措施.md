Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 21st: The Northeast region, including Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, will greatly accelerate the pace of agriculture, fully utilizing the land in this vast and fertile area to rapidly increase the unit area yield and total output of crops. This issue was studied at the recent agricultural collaboration meeting held in Harbin in this region.

This meeting was chaired by Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan, with the participation of the Party secretaries in charge of agriculture from each province and region, as well as relevant department heads.

The meeting discussed the production increase targets of each province and region for this year, next year, and 1962, and studied specific measures to increase production. These measures include ten points: 1. Launching a high tide of water conservancy construction to achieve water conservancy; 2. Massively accumulating manure and producing local chemical fertilizers in every township, commune, and team, and local industries should also set up bacterial fertilizer factories; 3. Universally deep plowing the land and applying fertilizer in layers; 4. Universally advocating reducing ridges and increasing rows, increasing the number of crop plants, and promoting intercropping and mixed cropping, as well as close planting of wheat in rows; 5. Achieving improved varieties, with each commune establishing seed plots, allowing the masses to select, breed, retain, and use seeds themselves; 6. Expanding the area of multiple cropping, planting early in a timely manner, striving for early maturity, and avoiding frost; 7. Strengthening field management, universally achieving intensive cultivation and meticulous farming, and promptly checking seedlings and replanting, irrigating, and topdressing; 8. Timely preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests such as rice blast, sorghum aphids, corn borers, and cotton aphids and red spiders; 9. Launching a high-yield field movement and establishing pacesetters; 10. Universally promoting new and improved agricultural tools.

The meeting believed that this year is a good start for the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions to achieve the leap forward plan in agriculture. This year, due to the high morale of the masses, the increase in paddy fields and irrigated land, the universal application of more fertilizer, more hoeing and weeding, deep plowing and meticulous farming, the growth of various crops is good, and it is entirely possible to complete this year's grain production increase target if there are no special natural disasters. In this way, Liaoning Province, which has always relied on other provinces for grain support, will be able to achieve self-sufficiency in grain this year with a surplus; other provinces and regions will also have a large increase in grain.

The meeting believed that oil crops should also be rapidly increased in production, and the main method is to increase the yield per unit area, especially the yield of soybeans, while also appropriately expanding the area of oil crops.

In order to adapt to the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, the merging of large cooperatives has become an increasingly urgent requirement of the masses. The meeting focused on studying this issue. Liaoning Province completed the work of merging into large cooperatives in May. Based on the practical experience of Liaoning Province, the meeting affirmed the superiority of the large cooperatives, and Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia are all preparing to start the work of merging cooperatives around the autumn harvest this year, according to the conditions stipulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

In order to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production, the meeting believed that it is necessary to continue to oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, criticize the negative tendencies that only see unfavorable conditions (vast land and sparse population, extensive cultivation, short frost-free period, etc.) and do not see favorable conditions (people's awareness, fertile land, etc.), and advocate the communist style of daring to think and daring to do; it is necessary to actively support the revolutionary demands and initiatives of the masses, and follow the mass line in everything; it is necessary to follow the spirit of continuous revolution, constantly put forward new slogans and goals, encourage the masses to move forward, and constantly carry out mass movements, so that all agricultural work and construction work can be done quickly and well. In order to do all this well, the meeting believed that it is necessary to emphasize the leadership of the secretaries and comprehensive collaboration, and not allow you to move and I don't move, here to move and there not to move.

In addition, the meeting also made special studies on further running state-owned farms well, developing animal husbandry, planting trees and afforestation, and water and soil conservation.

    全面协作加速农业步伐
    东北和内蒙古制订十项增产措施
    新华社哈尔滨21日电  东北地区辽宁、吉林、黑龙江各省和内蒙古自治区，将大大地加快农业的步伐，使这个面积极其辽阔、土壤极其肥沃的广大地区充分发挥地力，迅速提高农作物的单位面积产量和总产量。最近在哈尔滨召开的这个地区的农业协作会议，研究了这个问题。
    这次会议是由农业部部长廖鲁言主持召开的，参加会议的有各省区负责农业的党委书记和有关部门负责人。
    会议讨论了各省区今年、明年和1962年的增产指标，研究了具体的增产措施。这些措施有十条：一、掀起水利建设高潮，实现水利化；二、乡乡、社社、队队大量积肥并制造土化肥，地方工业还要举办细菌肥料厂；三、普遍深翻土地，并分层施肥；四、普遍提倡缩垅增行，增加作物棵数，推广混种间种，小麦条播密植；五、实现良种化，社社建立种子地，由群众自选、自育、自留、自用；六、扩大复种面积，适时早种，争取早熟，避免霜冻；七、加强田间管理，普遍作到精耕细作，及时查苗补苗，灌水追肥；八、及时防治稻瘟病、高粱蚜虫、玉米螟虫、棉蚜红蜘蛛等病虫害；九、开展丰产田运动，树立标兵；十、普遍推广新式和改良农具。
    会议认为，今年是东北和内蒙古地区实现农业跃进规划的良好开端。今年由于群众情绪高涨，水田和水浇地增加，普遍多施肥、多铲趟、深耕细作，所以各种农作物生长情况良好，如果没有特殊的自然灾害，完成今年粮食增产指标是完全可能的。这样，历来依靠外省支援粮食的辽宁省，今年粮食将可以自给而有余；其他省区粮食也将有很大增加。
    会议认为油料作物也应迅速增产，方法主要是提高单位面积产量，特别是大豆的产量，同时也要适当地扩大油料作物面积。
    为适应农业生产大跃进的形势，并大社日益成为群众的迫切要求。会议着重地研究了这个问题。辽宁省已在5月份完成了并大社的工作。根据辽宁省的实际经验，会议肯定了大社的优越性，黑龙江、吉林和内蒙古都准备在今年秋收前后，根据中共中央规定的条件，着手进行并社工作。
    为了实现农业生产大跃进，会议认为必须继续反对右倾保守思想，批判那种只看见不利条件（地广人稀、耕作粗放、无霜期短等）、看不见有利条件（人民觉悟、土地肥沃等）的消极倾向，提倡敢想敢干的共产主义风格；必须积极地支持群众的革命要求和创议，凡事走群众路线；必须依照不断革命的精神，经常地提出新的口号和奋斗目标，鼓励群众前进，不断地开展群众运动，使各项农活和建设工作都能做得又快又好。为了做好这一切，会议认为必须强调书记挂帅和全面协作，不允许你动我不动，这里动那里不动。
    另外，会议还对进一步办好国营农场、发展牧畜业、植树造林和水土保持等工作专门作了研究。
