    反对美英帝国主义侵略中东国家
    印度人民示威运动更加高涨
    新华社新德里30日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，在今天结束的印度共产党旁遮普邦委员会书记处会议决定在8月的第一个星期在邦内开展“中东周”的活动。
    在这一周内，特别是在邦内的城镇中，将举行群众集会和示威游行，以便动员舆论反对美英武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦，并且要求侵略军队撤出这两个国家。
    全印度学生大会决定把8月5日订为“不许干涉亚洲日”。全印度学生大会在全国各地的组织将召开群众集会和发动游行示威，抗议美英干涉中东国家内政的行动。
    印度全国妇女联合会最近就中东局势发表声明说，这个组织向黎巴嫩、伊拉克和约旦的妇女致敬，并且表示完全支持阿拉伯妇女为反对帝国主义和外国武装干涉而进行的英勇斗争。
    印度全国工会大会工作委员会最近也谴责英美干涉阿拉伯国家内政，并且要求西方国家立即停止对这个地区的军事干涉。
    “德里时代周刊”最近出版了一期中东专号，里面刊载了将近三十篇关于支持黎巴嫩、约旦和伊拉克人民以及谴责美英侵略的文章和新闻报道。
    这家周刊最近还拒绝刊载黎巴嫩驻新德里公使馆送给它的主编的一篇黎巴嫩外交部长马利克的演说稿，马利克在这篇演说中诽谤阿拉伯联合共和国。
    新华社新德里29日电　孟买一万五千工人在27日举行示威大会，谴责美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦。大会要求美英侵略者立即把它们的军队撤出中东。
    主持大会的印度共产党书记处书记丹吉在讲话中警告西方国家说，它们采取侵略行动就会碰上一个觉醒了的亚洲。
    在这以前，孟买亚非团结委员会也举行了一次集会，抗议美英侵略中东。集会呼吁一切爱好自由的国家给予西亚人民以道义上和物质上的支持。
    丹吉在这次集会上也讲了话。他指出，中东的纠纷是西方殖民国家一手造成的。丹吉指出，西方国家对西亚国家的油田的掠夺，正如英国在印度获得独立以前对印度进行的经济剥削一样。
    孟买邦的阿科拉、中央邦的赖普尔以及西孟加拉邦的米德纳浦、大吉岭、豪拉、呼格利、纳的阿等地的工人、农民和学生也举行了集会，抗议美英侵略中东。
