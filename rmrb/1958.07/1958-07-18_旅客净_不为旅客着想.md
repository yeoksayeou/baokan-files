    “Passenger Sweep” Doesn't Consider Passengers
    
    Fengtai Station is a large hub station, with many passengers traveling north and south getting on and off trains here every day. In the upsurge of the socialist Great Leap Forward, in order to improve service quality and eliminate the phenomenon of passengers waiting for trains for a long time, this station put forward a "Passenger Sweep" slogan, which was originally a good thing. However, in order to realize this slogan, instead of taking effective measures to properly transport passengers, they implemented a method of getting on any train that arrives. As soon as a train enters the station, service personnel mobilize all passengers going in that direction to board the train, regardless of the train's destination. Some passengers who do not want to take this train are also mobilized to board; some who bought ordinary passenger tickets are also mobilized to board express trains. As a result, the train is crowded, not only without seats, but even finding space for luggage is difficult. On June 28th, on the express train from Beijing to Harbin, an old woman who bought an ordinary ticket was mobilized to board the train by Fengtai Station. Because she didn't have money to pay for the express ticket supplement, she was very nervous and scared. The conductor repeatedly advised her to change to a slow train in Tianjin, but she refused. Ignoring the conductor's advice, she got off the train with her luggage when the train arrived at Yangcun Station.
    
    The motive of Fengtai Station in putting forward the slogan "Passenger Sweep" should be said to be good, but the method of mobilizing passengers to get on any train they see is not right, as it will cause difficulties for passengers. Therefore, I think the wording and practice of the "Passenger Sweep" slogan need to be appropriately revised.

### “旅客净”不为旅客着想

    “旅客净”不为旅客着想
    丰台车站是一个较大的枢纽站，每天都有很多南行北往的旅客在这里上下火车。在社会主义大跃进的高潮中，为了提高服务质量，消灭旅客长时间等车的现象，这个车站提出一个“旅客净”的口号，这原是件好事。但是，为实现这个口号，他们不是采取有效的措施，妥善的输送旅客，而是实行来车就上的办法。这个车站只要一有列车进站，服务员同志就按照列车前进的方向，动员全部往这个方向去的旅客上车，有的旅客不愿坐这次列车，也动员上车；有的买普通客车票的也动员上了快车。结果造成列车内人多拥挤，不但没有坐位，就连放行李的地方也难找到。6月28日，在由北京开往哈尔滨的快车上，有一位买普通票的老大娘被丰台车站动员上车后，因为没钱补快车票，精神非常紧张害怕，列车长一再劝她到天津再改乘慢车，可是她不听，她不顾车长的劝止，在列车到达杨村车站的时候，就拿着自己的行李下车了。
    丰台车站提出“旅客净”的口号的动机应该说是好的，但是，动员旅客见车就上的办法却不对头，这样作就会造成旅客的困难。因此，我认为“旅客净”口号的提法和做法，有适当修改的必要。
