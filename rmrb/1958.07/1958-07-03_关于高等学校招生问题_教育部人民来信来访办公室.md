    Regarding College Admissions Issues

    Letters and Visits Office of the Ministry of Education

    Recently, we have received letters from some units and young people wishing to apply to colleges and universities inquiring about specific issues related to this year's college admissions. These issues, in addition to those already specifically addressed in the "Regulations on the Enrollment of New Students in Colleges and Universities in 1958" issued by our ministry, are now comprehensively answered as follows. We will no longer respond to individual letters regarding these types of questions.

    Question: How will this year's college admissions work be conducted?

    Answer: This year, college admissions will change the previous method of unified national enrollment and implement individual or joint enrollment by schools. Therefore, there will be forms such as individual enrollment, joint enrollment by several schools, and joint enrollment by province (city) and autonomous region. The education administrative departments of each province (city) and autonomous region have, in conjunction with relevant departments and schools, established enrollment agencies and examination area offices in the provinces (cities) and autonomous regions. The provincial (city) and autonomous region enrollment agencies have, in accordance with the notices from the Ministry of Education and relevant central departments, uniformly arranged for the political review and health examination of candidates.

    Whether implementing individual enrollment or joint enrollment, colleges and universities will conduct enrollment in accordance with the enrollment area scope stipulated in the enrollment regulations. In order to facilitate candidates' applications, each province (city) and autonomous region will generally maintain the previous unified enrollment examination area settings. The examination area settings and registration and examination dates of each school are independently formulated by the schools or the provincial (city) and autonomous region enrollment agencies and announced to the candidates.

    Question: How will the health examination work for candidates be conducted?

    Answer: According to the joint notice issued by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health, the health examination work for candidates will be uniformly arranged by each province (city) and autonomous region. Candidates should undergo examinations at designated local medical units. The start and end dates of the candidate's health examination, examination procedures, and health examination standards will be announced to the candidates by the local enrollment agency.

    Question: Can candidates who have already applied to independently enrolling schools also apply to jointly enrolling schools?

    Answer: Candidates who have already applied to independently enrolling schools may also apply to jointly enrolling schools as long as the examination times do not conflict. If candidates are unable to return to their original examination area to apply to jointly enrolling schools due to traveling to other places to apply to independently enrolling schools, they can apply to apply to jointly enrolling schools in their current location with proof from the independently enrolling school they applied to.

    In order to avoid duplicate admissions as much as possible and ensure the smooth completion of the enrollment plans of various schools, new students who have been admitted by independently enrolling schools cannot apply to jointly enrolling schools, and those who have already applied will not be admitted; if some independently enrolling schools conduct enrollment after the joint enrolling schools hold examinations, new students who have been admitted by the joint enrolling schools cannot apply to independently enrolling schools, and those who have applied will not be admitted.

    Question: Can candidates apply to other places due to having certain professional foundations or specialties, or other special reasons?

    Answer: College admissions should implement the principle of local talent acquisition, but due to the large imbalance between the regional distribution of candidates and the college enrollment tasks, in order to adjust the quantity and quality of new students and ensure the better completion of the enrollment tasks, the enrollment area scope of each school has been uniformly arranged. In order to reduce the flow of candidates, it is still advisable to apply locally to schools enrolling in the local area. If candidates have certain professional foundations or specialties, or other special reasons, and hold a letter of introduction for application issued by the local (i.e., formal household registration location), they can apply to other places without restrictions.

    Question: What are the corrections to the contents of the "1958 College Entrance Examination Syllabus"?

    Answer: 1. Language Examination Syllabus: Due to the simplification of some literature textbooks in high school this semester, the following four lessons should be deleted from the language examination syllabus: "A Declaration," "Joining the Army," "Opinions on the League of Left-Wing Writers," and "Comrade Lao Yang."

    2. Political Common Sense Examination Syllabus: According to reports from various places, the content, teaching methods, and teaching progress of the "Socialist Education Course" currently taught in high schools are not entirely consistent. The originally ordered political common sense examination syllabus is completely invalidated, and the examination scope is changed to important domestic political events and major current affairs in the past year.

### 关于高等学校招生问题  教育部人民来信来访办公室

    关于高等学校招生问题
    教育部人民来信来访办公室
    最近，我们收到一些单位和要求报考高等学校的青年来信询问有关今年高等学校招生的一些具体问题，这些问题，除了已在我部发布的“关于高等学校1958年招考新生的规定”中作了具体规定的以外，现在综合答复如下，我部关于这类问题的来信，不再一一答复。
    问：今年高等学校的招生工作，怎样进行？
    答：今年高等学校招生，决定改变以往全国统一招生的办法，实行学校单独或者联合招生。因此，将有单独招生、几校联合招生、以省（市）、自治区为单位的联合招生等形式，各省（市）、自治区的教育行政部门已经会同有关部门和学校建立了省（市）、自治区的招生机构和考区办事处，省（市）、自治区招生机构已根据教育部及中央有关部门的通知，统一布置进行考生的政治审查和健康检查等工作。
    不论实行单独招生或者实行联合招生的高等学校，都将按照招生规定中所规定的招生地区范围进行招生；为了便利考生报考，各省（市）、自治区大体上仍维持以往统一招生的考区设置。有关各学校的考区设置和报名、考试日期等，均由学校或省（市）自治区招生机构自行制订，并向考生公布。
    问：考生的健康检查工作，怎样进行？
    答：考生的健康检查工作，根据教育部、卫生部联合发布的通知，由各省（市）、自治区统一布置。考生应当在指定的当地医疗单位进行检查。有关考生健康检查的起止日期、检查手续以及健康检查标准等，由当地招生机构向考生公布。
    问：已经报考单独招生学校的考生，能否再报考联合招生的学校？
    答：已经报考单独招生学校的考生，只要是考试时间不冲突，也可以报考联合招生的学校。考生如因到外地报考单独招生学校，来不及赶回原来所在考区报考联合招生学校时，凭所报考的单独招生学校的证明，可以申请报考当时所在地的联合招生的学校。
    为了尽量避免重复录取，保证各学校的招生计划顺利完成，已被单独招生学校录取的新生，不能再报考联合招生的学校，已经报考了的也不再录取；如果有的单独招生学校在联合招生学校举行考试以后进行招生，已被联合招生学校录取的新生，也不能报考单独招生的学校，报考了的也不再录取。
    问：考生因具有某种专业基础或特长，以及有其他特殊原因，能否到外地报考？
    答：高等学校招生应该贯彻就地取材的原则，但是由于目前考生的地区分布和高等学校招生任务之间有较大的不平衡，为了调剂新生的数量和质量，保证招生任务的更好完成，各学校招生的地区范围，已经作了统一安排。为了减少考生的流动，还是以就地报考在当地招生的学校为宜。如果考生因具有某种专业基础或特长以及其他特殊原因，持有当地（即正式户口所在地）开具的介绍报考函件的可以到外地报考，不加限制。
    问：“1958年高等学校招生考试大纲”一书的内容有了哪些更正？
    答：一、语文考试大纲：由于高中在本学期精简了一部分文学教材，在语文考试大纲中应删掉下列四篇课文：“一篇宣言”、“参军”、“对于左翼作家联盟的意见”、“老杨同志”。
    二、政治常识考试大纲：根据各地反映，目前高中所学的“社会主义教育课程”的教材内容和教学方法以及教学进度不尽一致，原订的政治常识考试大纲全部作废，考试范围改为一年来国内重要政治事件和重大时事。（未完）
