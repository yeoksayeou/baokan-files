Warsaw, July 21st. On the eve of Poland's National Day (July 22nd), the reporter interviewed Wak, Vice Chairman of the Polish State Planning Commission, and asked him the following questions.

Question: What achievements has Poland's national economy made during the period of the people's government?

Answer: Although it has only been fourteen years since the establishment of the Polish people's government, we have achieved great achievements in the country's economic life. The people's government restored the country from the ravages of war with unparalleled speed and established a new series of economic sectors.

One of the major achievements since the war is that all national economic sectors have the conditions for high development. Before the war, Poland was a country dominated by agriculture. Now, more than 50% of Poland's national income comes from industry. Industrial production has increased more than fivefold compared to before the war, and sevenfold per capita. The output of basic industrial sectors before the war, such as steel, electricity, sulfuric acid, cement, and cotton yarn, was far lower than the world average. Now, Poland's output in these industrial sectors is much higher than the world average. In 1958, Poland's steel production was four times that of the pre-war period, electricity six and a half times, coal two and a half times, sulfuric acid three times, and cement nearly four times. The machine manufacturing industry has established many new departments after the war, such as shipbuilding, automobiles, mining machinery, and heavy machinery. The products of the machinery industry are well received in the international market, and its role in Polish exports is increasing.

From a technical point of view, Poland's industry has also undergone very important changes. Poland has established a series of new industrial enterprises after the war, and the technical level of these enterprises is no less than that of the most developed countries in the world. Some enterprises, such as one of the world's largest metallurgical complexes, the Lenin Metallurgical Plant near Krakow, are already world-renowned.

In agriculture, a series of achievements have also been made. Although the overall development of agriculture is slower, the total agricultural output has increased by 15% compared to the pre-war period, and nearly 40% per capita. Because the amount of arable land is limited, the main path for Poland's agricultural development is to increase yield per unit area. In recent years, grain yield per hectare has increased by three to four quintals compared to the pre-war period. Mechanical traction, which was non-existent before the war, is now used in agriculture. Nearly 40% of the countryside is now electrified.

However, this does not mean that agriculture has overcome all difficulties. Because many social and economic problems in Polish agriculture have not yet been resolved, some products are still increasing very little. For example, the harvest of potatoes and sugar beets has not achieved the growth it should have, and the number of livestock has not caught up with the pre-war level. However, these problems are currently on the road to correct resolution.

Question: How has the material living standard of the people improved based on the development of industry, agriculture, and other national economies?

Answer: As a result of industrial development and agricultural production increase, national income has greatly increased after the war. Now, Poland's national income has increased two and a half times compared to the pre-war period. Although a large part of the national income is used for investment and the development of the national economy, we have still greatly improved the consumption level of residents compared to the pre-war period. From the composition of consumer goods, we can also see that Poland is moving towards a higher level of consumption. For example, the consumption of valuable consumer goods and daily industrial products has increased particularly rapidly, while the consumption of potatoes and grains is decreasing.

However, because what we inherited from the landlord-capitalist government of Poland was a backward country, the average material living standard of the country is still relatively low. To improve the material living standards of the people at a faster rate is one of the most important tasks of the people's government in the recent period.

Question: What is the significance of economic cooperation with socialist countries for Poland's economic development?

Answer: Poland belongs to the big family of socialist countries, which is an important condition for the achievements of the Polish People's economic construction. The help of the Soviet Union and the use of the experience of Soviet socialist construction are important factors in our economic development. Poland obtains necessary raw materials from socialist countries, such as oil, iron ore, and cotton. In terms of technology, we also receive assistance from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Democratic Germany. Many modern scientific and technological sectors, such as the nuclear sector, could not have been developed in Poland without the help of the Soviet Union, which has a high level of technological development.

The new forms of increasingly expanded socialist countries' cooperation are also reflected in Poland's relations with various socialist countries. For example, Czech and Polish joint development of Polish sulfur mines, and Democratic Germany and Poland jointly developing lignite mines. We believe that this new form of cooperation will play a greater role in accelerating the economic development of all socialist countries.

Question: What is the prospect of Poland's national economic development?

Answer: Poland will continue to implement the policy of industrialization in the future. The policy of industrialization is the main condition for the comprehensive development of the country's productive forces and the construction of socialism. According to the current plan, by 1965, Poland's industrial level will be ten times higher than in 1938.

The main task of industrial development in the future is to make more extensive use of the country's natural resources, such as developing sulfur mines and natural gas, and developing a strong chemical industry based on these minerals. At the same time, use the abundant coal resources to generate electricity and develop the recently discovered copper mines. Metal smelting, machinery manufacturing, and building materials industries will also occupy a central position in future industrial development. In addition, we must continue to expand the construction of the coal mining industry, and at the same time prepare to develop daily industrial products and the food industry at a faster rate.

Relying on the constant support and brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union, and close cooperation with all fraternal socialist countries, Poland has begun to realize its long-term development plan, which is also our plan to ultimately build socialism. The realization of this plan will be an important contribution to the common cause of socialism and the peace forces of the world.

    人民政权建立十四年来
    波兰工农业都有很大进步
    波兰国家计划委员会副主席瓦克答本报记者问
    本报华沙21日电  在波兰国庆节（7月22日）前夕，记者访问了波兰国家计划委员会副主席瓦克，请他回答了下列问题。
    问：在人民政权时期，波兰国民经济获得了哪些成就？
    答：从波兰人民政权建立到现在虽只有十四年，但是我们在国家经济生活方面，获得了巨大成就。人民政权以无比的速度把国家从战争破坏中恢复过来，并新建立了一系列经济部门。
    所有的国民经济部门都有了高度发展的条件，这是战后主要成就之一。战前波兰是农业占优势的国家，现在波兰50％以上的国民收入来自工业。工业产量增加为战前的五倍多，按人口平均计算，则为战前的七倍。战前基本工业部门的产量，如钢、电力、硫酸、水泥和棉纱等，远比世界平均水平为低。现在波兰上述工业部门的产量，已比世界平均水平高得多了。1958年波兰钢的产量相当于战前的四倍，电力相当于六倍半、煤二倍半、硫酸三倍、水泥将近四倍。机器制造工业在战后建立了许多新部门，如造船、汽车、采矿机器、重型机器等。机器工业的产品在国际市场上获得好评，它在波兰出口中的作用也日益增加。
    从技术水平的观点来看，波兰工业也有了十分重要的改变。波兰战后建立了一系列的新的工业企业，这些企业的技术水平不亚于世界上最发达的国家。某些企业，如世界上最大的冶金联合厂之一，克拉科夫附近的列宁冶金厂，已是世界知名的。
    在农业方面，也获得了一系列成就。虽然整个农业的发展速度较慢，但农业的总产量比战前提高了15％，按人口平均计算提高了将近40％。因为可耕土地数量有限，波兰农业发展的主要道路是提高单位面积产量。最近几年，每公顷土地粮食产量比战前提高了三至四公担。在农业中使用了战前根本没有的机械牵引力。现在将近40％的农村已经电气化了。
    但是，这并不意味着农业已克服了所有困难。因为波兰农业方面许多社会的、经济的问题尚未解决，所以有些产品仍增产很少。例如土豆、甜菜的收获量，还没有得到应有的增长，牲畜的头数还没有赶上战前。但是这些问题目前正处在正确解决的道路上。
    问：在工农业和其他国民经济发展的基础上，人民物质生活水平提高得怎样？
    答：由于工业发展和农业增产的结果，战后国民收入有了巨大增长。现在波兰国民收入比战前增加了二点五倍。尽管国民收入中很大部分用于投资和国民经济的发展，但和战前相比，我们仍然大大提高了居民的消费水平。从消费品的组成上，也可以看出波兰在向更高的消费水平前进。例如，贵重消费品和日用工业品的消费量增长得特别快，而土豆和粮食的消费则在减少。
    不过，由于我们从波兰地主资本家政府继承下来的是一个落后的国家，所以现在国家平均物质生活水平仍然较低。以更快的速度提高人民的物质生活水平，是人民政权最近时期最重要的任务之一。
    问：同社会主义国家的经济合作，对波兰经济发展有何意义？
    答：波兰属于社会主义国家大家庭，是人民波兰经济建设成就的重要条件。苏联的帮助和利用苏联社会主义建设的经验，是我们经济发展的重要因素。波兰从社会主义国家得到必需的原料，如石油、铁矿砂、棉花等。在技术方面，我们也得到苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国的帮助。许多现代科学技术部门，例如核子部门，没有技术高度发展的苏联的帮助，波兰是不能发展起来的。
    日益扩大的社会主义国家合作的新形式，也表现在波兰与各社会主义国家的关系中。如捷波共同开发波兰硫磺矿，民主德国和波兰共同开发褐煤矿等。我们相信，这种合作的新形式将起更大的作用，加速所有社会主义国家的经济发展。
    问：波兰国民经济发展的远景如何？
    答：波兰今后将继续执行工业化政策。工业化政策是国家生产力全面发展和建成社会主义的主要条件。根据现在的计划，到1965年，波兰工业水平要高于1938年的十倍。
    今后工业发展的主要任务是，更加广泛利用国家的自然财富，如开发硫磺矿和天然煤气，在这些矿产的基础上发展强大的化学工业。同时利用丰富的煤的资源发电，开发最近发现的铜矿。金属冶炼、机器制造、建筑材料等工业，在未来的工业发展中，也占中心地位。此外，还要继续扩大煤矿工业的建设，同时准备以更快的速度发展日用工业品和食品工业。
    依靠苏联经常的支持和兄弟般的帮助，以及和所有兄弟社会主义国家的紧密合作，波兰开始实现自己的远景发展计划，这个计划同时也是我们最终建成社会主义的计划。实现这项计划，对社会主义的共同事业和全世界和平力量，将是一个重要的贡献。
