    Representatives from the Fujian Provincial Department of Commerce, Xiamen Commodity Inspection Bureau, Xiamen Industrial Bureau, Xiamen Stationery Factory, and Xiamen Chinese Company recently conducted an analysis and comparison of the newly formulated "Emerald Horse" brand ink and "Parker" brand ink under the same conditions. In terms of corrosiveness, "Emerald Horse" brand ink occupied 0.19% of the pen tip area, while "Parker" occupied 0.26%. In terms of sediment content, after agitating ten cubic centimeters of ink in a centrifuge at 3,200 revolutions per minute for ten minutes, "Emerald Horse" ink had only ten milligrams of sediment, while "Parker" ink had fifteen milligrams. In terms of capillary action, water resistance, and writing smoothness, the two were comparable. In terms of color, "Emerald Horse" brand was a bright blue, while "Parker" brand was a dark blue. The results of this evaluation prove that the quality of "Emerald Horse" brand ink has caught up with the old American brand, "Parker" ink. (Fujian Daily)

    “翡翠马”赶过“派克”墨水
    福建省商业厅、厦门市商品检验处、厦门市工业局、厦门市文具厂和厦门市中文公司等单位代表，最近把按新配方制成的“翡翠马”牌墨水和“派克”牌墨水，在同样条件下进行了分析比较。在腐蚀性方面，“翡翠马”牌墨水占笔尖面积0.19％，“派克”是0.26％；在沉淀量方面，每十立方公分的墨水在每分钟三千二百转的离心机搅动十分钟后，“翡翠马”墨水只有十毫克沉淀物，“派克”墨水却是十五毫克；在毛细管现象、耐水性、书写流利程度等方面都不相上下；在色泽方面，“翡翠马”牌是鲜蓝色，“派克”牌是暗蓝色。这个鉴定结果证明：“翡翠马”牌墨水的质量已经赶上了美国老牌的“派克”墨水。　（福建日报）
