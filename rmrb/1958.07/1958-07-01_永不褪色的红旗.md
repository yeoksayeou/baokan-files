    The Red Flag That Never Fades
    Liu Jia

    On the eve of the 37th great birthday of our Party, I thought of Comrade Shen Changlin, whom I met not long ago. There is no need to introduce too much about Comrade Shen Changlin's glorious history (he joined the Party in 1936 and was awarded the title of Model Party Member of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in 1943, a title he has retained to this day; he is also a labor model). He is now a member of the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Party Branch Secretary of the Majiagou Agricultural Cooperative in the Panlong District of Yan'an County, but he is also an ordinary worker who has never left his production post. He has to work and produce, and he is a model in both work and production.

    We heard many discussions about him from the surrounding masses:

    "Old Shen is a good man. At such an old age, he is building terraced fields on the mountain in the Great Leap Forward, even the young people have to chase after him."

    "In the cold winter nights, he goes to the Qian Gou bottom to build dams. Everyone advised him, 'The road in Luan Shi Gou is difficult to walk, and Old Shen is getting old, don't go,' he didn't say a word, shouldered his iron shovel, and walked at the front."

    "No one doesn't listen to what Old Shen says; no one doesn't follow the path Old Shen leads."

    The last sentence vividly portrays a leader who is loved and connected to the masses. In our country, there are many true leaders inside and outside the Party who are exactly like this. "No one doesn't listen to what he says, and no one doesn't follow the path he leads." If he hadn't been tested for a long time and proven that what he said and did completely conformed to everyone's interests, how could he have gained such high trust?

    The Majiagou Agricultural Cooperative has more than 200 sheep. Due to a lack of experience, they were not taken care of well, and more than a dozen died in succession. The cooperative held a general meeting to discuss this matter and decided to replace someone to herd the sheep, but no one wanted to do it. Although herding sheep is not too heavy work, it requires more effort than farming. More than 200 sheep are scattered on the steep slopes, and people have to constantly take care of them up and down, front and back, to prevent wolves from biting, to prevent sheep from falling off the mountain, and to ensure that all the sheep are full. Every time you move a place, you have to count them one by one. This work is even more unsuitable for an elderly person. However, Comrade Shen Changlin spoke: "If no one is available, I'll herd them." So, he started herding sheep.

    The day we went to his house was about one o'clock in the afternoon. People working in the mountains had already returned to the village for lunch, and some had already taken a nap, but only Comrade Shen Changlin was still herding sheep on the mountain and had not returned.

    For such a person with vigorous revolutionary spirit and abundant energy, in our imagination, he must be a tall, large, broad-shouldered, round-armed, mighty man with extraordinary strength. Only after seeing him did we realize that he was just an old farmer over sixty years old (sixty-four years old), his hair was already white, and his back was slightly hunched. Where did his strength come from?

    We asked him, now that work and production are in the Great Leap Forward, can Old Shen, at such an old age, keep up? He smiled humorously and said, "You see that this 'Old Shen' is too old, right? To be honest, if we could have had such a leap forward two years earlier, our Yan'an would have changed long ago. Why would we have waited until now? People must always have a great goal in order to continuously progress." We advised him that he was getting old after all, and he could skip things like repairing dams at night and leave them to the young people! They wouldn't mind.

    He shook his head and said, "I can go at my age; no one can say they can't go. As long as you take the lead, others will come without being urged." He called this "old experience."

    This is a bright red flag that never fades, nurtured by the never-ending revolutionary spirit of this great flag bearer. The ideological essence of this revolutionary spirit is to constantly "leap forward" and always demand a "great goal." And its method is his "old experience," "to take the lead!" The thought of "continuous revolution" plus the performance of "leading action" is the style of a true Communist Party member. Our Party has gained unparalleled glory because it has thousands upon thousands of such Party members.

    永不褪色的红旗
    刘甲
    在我们党的第三十七个伟大的生日的前夕，我想起了不久前见到的申长林同志来，关于申长林同志的光荣历史，（他从1936年入党，1943年被奖励为陕甘宁边区模范党员，这称号一直保持到现在，他还是劳动模范）无须再做过多的介绍。他现在是中共延安地委的委员，又是延安县蟠龙区马家沟农业社党支部书记，但是他又是一个没有离开过生产岗位的普通劳动者。他要工作又要生产，工作上是模范，生产上也是模范。
    我们听到周围群众对他的不少议论：
    “老申嘛，好样的。那么大年纪了，大跃进上山修梯田，连年轻人都得在后面紧追。”
    “数九寒天的黑夜，到前沟底里修水坝，大家劝他‘乱石沟路难走，老申上了年纪，不去了吧’，他话也不说，肩起铁锨来走在最前头。”
    “老申说下的话，没有人不听；老申领下的路，没有人不走。”
    后边一句话，活活画出了一个受人爱戴与群众血肉相连的领袖。我们国家里，党内外有许多真正的领袖人物，正是这种样子。“话说下没有人不听，路领下没有人不走。”倘不是久经考验，证实所说所行，完全符合大家的利益，怎会得到这样高的信任？
    马家沟农业社有二百多只羊。因为缺乏经验，照管的不好，接连死了十来只。社里开大会讨论这件事，决定换一个人来拦羊，但是没有人愿意干。因为拦羊活虽不算太重，可是比起务庄稼来要格外费心。二百多只羊分散在陡坡上吃草，人要不断上上下下前前后后地照料，又要防着狼来咬，又要防着羊跌下山，又要照顾到所有的羊都吃饱，挪一次地方要点一次数。这活对于一个老年人来说，更是不适宜的。但是申长林同志说话了：“没有人，我给咱拦上。”于是，他便拦起羊来了。
    我们到他家的那一天，大约是下午的一点多钟。在山上作活的人，都已回村吃过中饭，有的已经歇晌睡觉了，只有申长林同志在山上拦羊还没有回来。
    对于这样一个革命精神旺盛，精力充沛的人，在我们想像中，他一定是身高体大，肩宽臂圆，威威武武有着非凡力气的一条大汉，一见之后才明白，他只不过是一个年过花甲（六十四岁了）的老农民，头发已然雪白，背也微微的有些驼了。他的力量是从哪里来的呢？
    我们问他，现在工作和生产都在大跃进，申老这样大年纪，顶得下来吗？他很有风趣地笑着说：“你们看着这‘申老’老的不行了不是？老实说吧，要是早两年能够这样跃进一下，咱们延安早就变了样了。那里还等到现在呢？人要时常有个大奔头，才能不断进步的。”我们劝他，倒底是有了些年纪了，像黑夜修坝的事，可以不去了，让给年轻人们吧！他们不会计较的。
    他摇了摇头说：“我这样的年纪能去；任谁就不能说不能去，你只要头前一走，别的人不用催就会来的。”他把这称作是“老经验”。
    这是一面鲜红的永不褪色的旗子，是由这位伟大旗手的永不衰竭的革命精神所培育着的。这种革命精神的思想实质，就是要不断“跃进”，时常要求有一个“大奔头”。而它的方法，就是他的“老经验”，“自己要先走在前头”！“不断革命”的思想，加“率先行动”的表现，这就是一个真正的共产党员的作风。我们党因为有着千千万万这样的党员而获得无尚的光荣。
