Taking Steel as the Key Link to Drive the Overall Great Leap Forward in Industry

Anhui Sets Deadlines and Production Targets to Accelerate Factory Construction

(Our dispatch from Hefei) Anhui Province has decided to utilize the rich coal and iron resources from northern to southern Anhui to rapidly build Anhui into an important base for the national iron and steel industry.

The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires that all organizations, factories, agricultural cooperatives, schools, and neighborhood committees with iron ore resources adopt indigenous methods for iron smelting. The provincial Party committee will take the lead in setting up four small blast furnaces.

Anhui has adopted the method of setting deadlines, stipulating production targets, and rapidly developing the iron and steel industry. The province plans to build 7,300 small blast furnaces with a volume of 3 cubic meters or less by the end of August. This year, it will also build 236 medium and small blast furnaces with a volume of more than 3 cubic meters. In terms of steelmaking, in addition to accelerating the construction of the Ma'anshan large-scale iron and steel complex, it is also necessary to accelerate the construction of six medium-sized iron and steel complexes in Hefei, Huainan, Tongguanshan, Wuhu, Bengbu, and Anqing. The majority of the province's machinery factories will adopt the method of self-made equipment to build one or two one-ton steelmaking converters, striving to complete construction and put them into production around October. Every county with the necessary conditions should also build small converters. After these blast furnaces and steelmaking furnaces are completed and partially put into production, they will produce 700,000 tons of pig iron this year (the local pig iron output in 1957 was only over 10,000 tons) and 150,000 tons of steel (the steel output in 1957 was only 2,000 tons).

The masses in various places have brought their creativity into full play and come up with many ways to solve the difficulties in ironmaking and steelmaking. Ren Weiqing, a furnace worker in Bengbu City, used indigenous methods to produce high-quality steel; Sun Maoke, a student at Hefei Mining College, also used simple equipment and oxygen blowing to produce high-quality steel.

Guizhou to Build Five "Nine-Five-Four" Plants This Year

(Our dispatch from Guiyang) Guizhou Province, which has historically never produced steel, is vigorously developing the steelmaking industry. Steelmaking equipment with an annual output of 400,000 tons of steel will be put into production this year.

The provincial steelmaking conference determined that this year, in Guiyang, Zunyi, Duyun, Shuicheng, and Fuquan, each will build an "Nine-Five-Four" (that is, an annual output of 90,000 tons of pig iron, 50,000 tons of steel, and 40,000 tons of steel products) iron and steel joint factory, as the backbone for the province's future development of the iron and steel industry; at the same time, 60 small steelmaking converters will be installed throughout the province.

As early as May, the province's relevant leading departments convened a meeting of the province's larger machinery factories, farm tool factories, and iron factories to arrange for the production of steelmaking equipment. Now, Guiyang General Machinery Factory has successively produced five small steelmaking furnaces with a capacity of 300 kilograms of steel. Guiyang Foundry has installed the small steelmaking furnace made by the General Machinery Factory and started trial smelting. The converter installed by Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory has already produced low-carbon steel.

Currently, a mass movement to increase pig iron production by the whole Party and the whole people has taken shape throughout the province. The Bijie Special Zone in the high and cold mountainous area of ​​Northwest China has newly built more than 1,500 indigenous blast furnaces. The Zunyi Special Zone has produced more than 17,000 tons of pig iron.

Recently, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to the province, requiring that 10,000 indigenous iron smelting blast furnaces be built before the end of July, so that this year's pig iron output will reach or exceed 500,000 tons. Zhejiang Intensifies Work in Four Aspects

(Our dispatch from Hangzhou) Since June, Zhejiang has begun to build a batch of small blast furnaces for iron smelting and small converters for steelmaking. It is expected that 750 small blast furnaces will be put into production before National Day this year.

Relying on the masses, Zhejiang has discovered rich iron ore resources. More than 73 of the province's 80-plus counties and cities have been found to contain iron ore.

At present, various parts of the province are intensifying their work in four aspects: first, quickly identifying mineral deposits, setting up mining training classes, and organizing labor to mine iron ore; second, machinery manufacturing plants, etc., are stepping up the production of equipment such as water pumps, blowers, power machines, converters, cranes, and rolling mills for 750 small blast furnaces; third, in addition to studying the use of brick and tile factories and pottery factories to make refractory materials, they are also actively promoting the use of charcoal rammed into the furnace belly and bottom to replace refractory bricks, and a large number of coking kilns are being built along transportation lines; fourth, various measures are being taken to cultivate technical forces. Each county has selected a group of workers to study iron smelting technology at Zhejiang Iron and Steel Plant and Shaoxing Iron and Steel Plant.

Hubei Combines Indigenous and Foreign Methods for Speed and Savings

(Our dispatch from Wuhan) Hubei Province is adopting the method of decentralized iron smelting and focused steelmaking to accelerate the development of the iron and steel industry.

This year, the province is building or is about to build more than 200 small blast furnaces. Surrounding these small blast furnaces, thousands of indigenous blast furnaces are being built; by the end of next year, seven steel plants will be built in seven key counties and cities. Among these seven steel plants, Huangshi Iron and Steel Plant and Echeng Iron and Steel Plant have already started full-scale construction; among them, the No. 1 blast furnace of Huangshi Iron and Steel Plant has been completed ahead of schedule and has started tapping iron.

In the process of developing the iron and steel industry, various places first boldly develop indigenous iron smelting in areas with iron ore resources, and then use indigenous methods to support the construction of small blast furnaces. This method is fast and economical. Yidu County used this method to build 20 indigenous blast furnaces before early July, and used indigenous iron to support the construction of three small blast furnaces, which can produce more than 10,000 tons of pig iron this year. In addition, some machinery and farm tool factories in Yichang, Xiangyang, and Huanggang Special Zones also used their own equipment to manufacture small blast furnaces for their own use or to support others. The employees of Xiangyang Agricultural Machinery Factory spent more than 40 days manufacturing and installing a small blast furnace with a volume of 5 cubic meters. This factory plans to manufacture 50 sets of small blast furnace equipment for the surrounding counties this year.

Shaanxi Vigorously Manufactures Equipment and Trains Personnel

(Our dispatch from Xi'an) Shaanxi Province is adopting revolutionary methods to develop the iron and steel industry from scratch. Among the first batch of ten small blast furnaces under construction, the Lintong iron smelting furnace with a daily output of ten tons of pig iron and the Tongchuan iron smelting furnace with a daily output of two tons have already produced molten iron.

In order to solve the problem of materials needed to manufacture iron smelting equipment, various places are clearing warehouses and launching a mass movement to collect scrap iron and steel. At present, the masses in various places have collected more than 300 tons of scrap and old iron and steel, and have also concentrated more than 700 tons of materials through clearing warehouses and borrowing from state-owned factories, allowing the machinery industry to manufacture metallurgical equipment first. Some of the power equipment used for the first batch of small blast furnaces was transferred from textile and water conservancy departments. Counties also support each other. For example, Xianyang County transferred the blower that was preparing to set up a flour mill to Hu County to set up a small blast furnace.

Shaanxi Province pays great attention to cultivating the technical strength for developing the iron and steel industry. When building the province's first small blast furnace in Lintong, the eight furnace-building workers borrowed from North China took more than 70 bricklayers sent by various counties to build and train at the same time. When it was about to be completed, the old workers took the new workers to various places to build new furnaces and continue to expand the scale of training. Each county also selected more than 270 new workers in two batches to study iron smelting technology in Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan, and Jiangsu provinces; more than 90 people transferred from various places are studying product testing in Xi'an. In addition, technical schools will also be established.

Jiangsu Mobilizes All People to Work Hard for Three Months

(Our dispatch from Nanjing) Jiangsu Province, which has always been famous for its developed light industry, has mobilized all the people to change the "vacuum" situation of the iron and steel industry.

Nanjing City achieved the blooming of indigenous steelmaking everywhere within ten days. Zhenjiang Special Zone, which has relatively abundant resources, will build 2,000 to 2,500 small blast furnaces of 0.8 meters this year to ensure an output of 150,000 tons of iron. Qishuyan Locomotive Factory used a 0.3-ton Bessemer small converter to turn the iron smelted by indigenous methods into steel. This small converter alone can produce 4,000 tons of steel per year. Many textile factories are using the equipment and technical strength of the repair workshop to make iron and steel on a large scale. Many government officials, school teachers and students, shop assistants, handicraft workers, and residents have also joined the tide of making iron and steel on a large scale. Residents of Qishuyan District in Changzhou City collected 65 tons of refractory bricks in one district. Students of the Affiliated Middle School of Nanjing Normal College used a gasoline drum and refractory bricks found in the pigsty to smelt medium-carbon steel; now the whole school has made steelmaking one of the contents of part-work and part-study, and it is expected to smelt 150 tons of steel by the end of the year.

While engaging in indigenous steelmaking and iron smelting on a large scale, the province's four medium-sized iron and steel plants with an annual output of 300,000 to 400,000 tons of steel are also stepping up design and construction, striving to put them into production as soon as possible.

The province plans to work hard in July, August, and September to produce 44,000 to 60,000 tons of steel by the end of September.

Henan Builds Small Blast Furnaces on a Large Scale

(Our dispatch from Zhengzhou) Henan Province adopts the policy of focusing on indigenous blast furnaces and simple small blast furnaces, and gradually moving towards a combination of large, medium, and small, to develop the iron and steel industry. At present, a mass movement of iron smelting with small blast furnaces is being carried out throughout the province. More than 30,000 indigenous blast furnaces and simple small blast furnaces can be built this year, and the iron smelting capacity can reach 4 million tons. Several cities and larger machinery manufacturing plants in the province will build 36 steel rolling and steelmaking plants. Now, there are more than 600 small blast furnaces and indigenous blast furnaces that have been put into production throughout the province, smelting more than 10,000 tons of pig iron. This kind of indigenous blast furnace only needs an investment of about 30 yuan, and it can be built in ten days, and it can produce 500 to 1,000 jin of pig iron per day; a semi-indigenous and semi-foreign simple small blast furnace can be built in half a month, each with an investment of more than 10,000 yuan, and it can produce 3 to 5 tons of pig iron per day.

    以钢为纲，带动工业全面大跃进
    安徽限时间定产量加速建厂
    本报合肥电  安徽省决定利用从淮北到皖南蕴藏的丰富煤铁资源，把安徽迅速建成全国钢铁工业的重要基地之一。
    中共安徽省委要求凡是有铁矿的地方，无论机关、工厂、农业社、学校、居民委员会都采用土法炼铁。省委机关带头自办四个小型高炉。
    安徽采取了限定时间，规定产量，迅速发展钢铁工业的办法。全省最近计划要在今年建设三立方公尺以下的小高炉七千三百个，这些小高炉要在8月底全部建成投入生产。今年还将兴建三立方公尺以上的中、小型高炉二百三十六个。在炼钢方面，除了加快建设马鞍山大型钢铁联合企业外，还要加快建设合肥、淮南、铜官山，芜湖、蚌埠、安庆等六个市的中型钢铁联合企业。全省大多数的机械厂，将采取自制设备的办法，建设一个到两个一吨的炼钢转炉，争取在10月左右建成投入生产。每个有条件的县也要建设小型转炉。这些高炉和炼钢炉陆续建成，部分投入生产以后，今年要生产生铁七十万吨（1957年地方生铁产量只有一万多吨），生产钢十五万吨（1957年钢产量只有两千吨）。
    各地群众发挥创造性，想出许多办法解决了炼铁、炼钢中的困难。蚌埠市熔炉工任谓卿，用土办法炼出了优质钢；合肥矿业学院学生孙茂科利用简陋设备，采取吹氧办法也炼出了优质钢。（附图片）

    贵州今年建五个“九、五、四”
    本报贵阳电  历史上从来不产钢的贵州省，正在大力发展炼钢工业。今年内将有年产四十万吨钢的炼钢设备投入生产。
    省炼钢会议确定，今年要在贵阳、遵义、都匀、水城和福泉，各建一座“九、五、四”（即年产九万吨生铁、五万吨钢、四万吨钢材）的钢铁联合工厂，作为全省今后发展钢铁工业的骨干；同时要在省内各地安装起六十个小型炼钢转炉。
    早在5月份，省有关领导部门就召集省内较大的机械厂、农具厂和铁工厂开会，对生产炼钢设备作了安排。现在，贵阳通用机械厂已先后生产出五座容量三百公斤钢的小型炼钢炉。贵阳翻砂厂已经把通用机械厂制成的小型炼钢炉安装起来，开始试炼。贵阳矿山机器厂安装起来的转炉，已经炼出低炭钢。
    目前，一个全党全民增产生铁的运动，已在全省范围内形成。西北高寒山区的毕节专区，已经新建了一千五百多个土高炉。遵义专区已经生产出生铁一万七千多吨。
    最近，中共贵州省委向全省发出指示，要求争取在7月底以前建好一万座炼铁土高炉，使今年生铁产量达到或超过五十万吨。浙江从四方面加紧工作
    本报杭州电  浙江各地6月份以来开始兴建一批炼铁的小高炉和炼钢的小转炉，预计在今年国庆节前有七百五十个小高炉投入生产。
    浙江各地依靠群众发现了丰富的铁矿资源。全省八十多个县市就发现有七十三个县市蕴藏着铁矿。
    目前全省各地正在从四个方面加紧工作：首先是迅速摸清矿藏，开办采矿训练班，组织劳动力开采铁矿；其次是各地机械制造厂等加紧为七百五十个小高炉赶制水泵、鼓风机、动力机、转炉、行车、轧钢机等设备；第三，除研究利用砖瓦厂、陶器厂做耐火器材外，还积极推广用炭捣炉腹、炉底来代替耐火砖，交通沿线正在兴建大批炼焦窑；第四，采取各种办法培养技术力量。各县都选送一批工人到浙江钢铁厂和绍兴钢铁厂学习炼铁技术。
    湖北以土带洋又快又省
    本报武汉电  湖北省采取分散炼铁、重点炼钢的办法，加速发展钢铁工业。
    今年全省正在兴建和即将兴建的小高炉有二百多座。围绕着这些小高炉，星罗棋布地建立数以千计的土高炉；明年年底以前将在七个重点县市建成七个炼钢厂。这七个炼钢厂，目前已经全面施工的有黄石钢铁厂和鄂城钢铁厂；其中黄石钢铁厂的一号高炉，已经提前建成并开始出铁。
    各地在发展钢铁工业的过程中，首先在有铁矿资源的地区，放手发展土法炼铁，然后以土带洋，用土铁支援小高炉的建设。这种作法又快又省。宜都县就是用这个办法在7月上旬以前建成二十座土高炉，用土铁支援建设三座小高炉，今年就可生产生铁一万多吨。另外，宜昌、襄阳、黄冈专区一部分机械农具工厂，也利用本厂的设备，制造小高炉，炼铁自用或支援别人。襄阳农业机械厂职工，用四十多天时间制造和安装了一座容积五立方公尺的小高炉。这个工厂今年计划为周围各县制造五十套小高炉设备。
    陕西大力制造设备培训人员
    本报西安电  陕西省采用革命办法，从无到有地发展钢铁工业。第一批开工建设的十座小高炉中，日产十吨生铁的临潼炼铁炉和铜川日产二吨的炼铁炉等已流出铁水。
    为了解决制造炼铁设备所需材料问题，各地正在清仓和开展群众性搜集废钢铁运动。目前，各地群众已经搜集了三百多吨废、旧钢铁，通过清理仓库和向国营大厂借用，也集中了七百多吨材料，让机械工业先制造冶金设备。第一批小高炉用的动力设备，有一部分是从纺织和水利等部门调剂的。各县之间也互相支援。例如，咸阳县就把准备办面粉厂的鼓风机调给鄠县办小高炉。
    陕西省很注意培养发展钢铁工业的技术力量。在临潼建设全省第一座小高炉时，从华北借用的八名建炉工人，带着各县派来的七十多名瓦工，边建设边训练。快建成时，老工人又分别带新工人到各地再建新炉，继续扩大培训规模。各县还抽出二百七十多名新工人分两批到四川、湖南、云南、江苏四省学习炼铁技术；各地调来的九十多个人正在西安学习成品化验。另外，还要办技术学校。
    江苏全民动员猛干三月
    本报南京电  一向以轻工业发达著名的江苏省，全民动手，改变钢铁工业的“真空”状况。
    南京市在十天之内就做到了土法炼钢遍地开花。资源比较丰富的镇江专区，今年要兴建零点八公尺的小高炉二千个到二千五百个，保证出铁十五万吨。戚墅堰机车厂用零点三吨贝氏小转炉，将土法炼出的铁水炼成了钢。单是这一个小转炉，就可年产钢四千吨。许多纺织工厂都在利用修理车间的设备和技术力量大炼钢铁。不少机关干部、学校师生、商店店员、手工业工人和居民也投入了大搞钢铁的浪潮。常州戚墅堰区一个区的居民就搜集了六十五吨耐火砖。南京师范学院附属中学的学生，用一只汽油桶和猪圈里找出来的耐火砖，炼出了中炭钢；现在全校已将炼钢作为勤工俭学的内容之一，预计到年底可以炼钢一百五十吨。
    在大搞土法炼钢炼铁的同时，全省四个年产三十万吨到四十万吨钢的中型钢铁工厂，也在加紧设计和施工，争取早日投入生产。
    全省计划在7、8、9三个月内猛干一场，到9月底产钢四万四千吨到六万吨。
    河南大建小高炉
    本报郑州电  河南省采取以土高炉和简易小高炉为主，逐步走向大中小型相结合的方针，发展钢铁工业。目前，全省正在开展一个群众性的小高炉炼铁运动。在今年内可建成土高炉和简易小高炉三万多座，炼铁能力可达到四百万吨。全省几个城市和较大的机械制造厂，要建轧钢、炼钢厂三十六个。现在，全省已经投入生产的小高炉和土高炉有六百多座，炼出了一万多吨生铁。这种土高炉一般只需投资三十元左右，十天就能建成，可以日产生铁五百斤到一千斤；半土半洋的简易小高炉半个月可以建成，每个投资一万多元，日产生铁三吨到五吨。
