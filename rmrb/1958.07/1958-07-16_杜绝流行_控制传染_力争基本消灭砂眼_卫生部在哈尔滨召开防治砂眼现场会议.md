Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 15th. The national on-site conference on trachoma prevention and treatment convened by the Ministry of Health in Harbin from July 5th to 11th, in the spirit of the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, proposed that the entire country strive to basically eliminate trachoma, a disease that has harmed the health of the Chinese people for thousands of years, within ten years or less.

Leading eye specialists, professors, veteran practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, and trachoma prevention personnel from all over the country went to Lanxi County, Heilongjiang Province, to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the effective experiences in trachoma prevention and treatment by following the mass line and preventing and treating blindness caused by trachoma. They visited two agricultural cooperatives that had already eliminated trachoma. They believed that these vivid examples provided a reliable basis for preventing and treating trachoma in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, and for eliminating trachoma nationwide within ten years.

The practice of Lanxi County, Heilongjiang Province, is to establish trachoma prevention and treatment institutions in all townships throughout the county this year, achieving prevention and treatment stations in every cooperative and personnel in every team to administer eye drops for trachoma patients. Whether in winter or summer, the county considers how not to delay farmers' production when preventing and treating trachoma. Trachoma prevention and treatment personnel also frequently go to the countryside for mobile medical services, which the masses find very convenient. During the trachoma prevention month last year, the county also set up simple wards for farmers, or adopted methods of seeing patients and administering medicines on the spot, according to the habits of the farmers.

He Biao, Vice Minister of Health, said in his summary at the meeting: The requirement to basically eliminate trachoma in ten years or less is to put an end to the severe epidemic of trachoma, effectively control the transmission of trachoma, eliminate severe trachoma and blindness caused by trachoma as soon as possible, and restore the sight of all curable blind people. At the same time, it is also necessary to eliminate mild trachoma.

During the conference, two trachoma experts invited by the Soviet government also gave reports on the prevention and treatment of trachoma.

    杜绝流行　控制传染　力争基本消灭砂眼
    卫生部在哈尔滨召开防治砂眼现场会议
    新华社哈尔滨15日电　卫生部7月5日到11日在哈尔滨召开的全国防治砂眼现场会议，按总路线多快好省的精神，提出全国力争在十年或更短的时间内基本消灭几千年来一直危害我国人民健康的砂眼。
    来自全国各地的著名的眼科专家、教授、老中医、砂眼防治人员到黑龙江省兰西县实地考察了走群众路线防治砂眼和防治因砂眼致盲的有效经验，他们参观访问了两个已经消灭砂眼的农业社。他们认为这些活生生的事例，给多快好省的防治砂眼，十年内在全国消灭砂眼提供了可靠的依据。
    黑龙江省兰西县的作法是今年内在全县各乡普遍建立砂眼防治机构，达到社社有防治站，队队有为砂眼病患者点药水的人员。这个县不论在冬季或是夏季防治砂眼时，都考虑如何不耽误农民生产。砂眼防治人员还经常下乡巡回医疗，群众感到非常方便。这个县在去年的砂眼防治月里，还为农民设置了简易病房，或按照农民的习惯，采取就地看病，就地投药的办法。
    卫生部副部长贺彪在会议总结时说：在十年或更短的时间内基本消灭砂眼的要求是：杜绝砂眼的严重流行，有效地控制砂眼的传染，早日消灭重症砂眼，和因砂眼而致盲，并使一切可以救治的盲人复明，同时还要做到消灭轻症砂眼。
    会议期间，苏联政府应邀派来的两位砂眼的专家还在会上作了有关砂眼预防和治疗的报告。
