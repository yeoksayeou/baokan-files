Get Out, Anglo-American Aggressors!
By our reporter Liu Peiheng

	We workers have strength,
		To support our Middle Eastern brothers in liberation;
	The factory is a battlefield,
		The workshop is the front line.
	One more book published,
		Is one more bullet sent to the front;
	Publishing a second faster,
		Is one more unit of support provided.

The news of the Anglo-American imperialist aggression in the Middle East has enraged all the workers of the Xinhua Printing Factory in the capital. Everyone is indignant and protesting, determined to strike at the aggressors with their practical actions and support the just struggle of the Arab people.

On the evening of the 18th, the Writers Publishing House sent a new manuscript, "Break the Spine of the Aggressors." When the workers saw that it was a collection of poems, essays, and paintings against Anglo-American aggression in the Arab world, they all said that these were the "bullets" with which writers and poets fought the enemy and that they must be transported to the "front" as quickly as possible. Workers in more than twenty processes did not leave work and immediately plunged into the battle to win every second.

The typesetting workers received the original manuscript from the foreman of the typesetting group and immediately began to act. In front of the towering racks of lead type, they looked at the original manuscript and picked out the type at lightning speed, completing the entire task in a few minutes. Liu Yulin, an old framing worker in the letterpress workshop, couldn't wait and ran to the letterpress workshop to inquire about the size and specifications of the typesetting, rushing back to get the framing done first. The workers who poured lead ingots, bare-backed, guarded the lead melting furnace. The red firelight shone on the faces of the workers, their sweat streaming down, but they didn't wipe it, only concentrating on nervously casting the lead plates. Young worker Jia Shihong poured lead ingots all day and insisted on working at night. Section chief Fu Wenguang urged him to rest several times, but he said: What does it matter to exert some effort and sweat a little to support the people of the Middle East!

In front of the rumbling full-sheet printing press, old worker Lu Xing'an was busy loading and unloading the type plates with his assistant. They adopted a cross-working method, completing work that used to take two or three hours in less than an hour. This old worker had personally witnessed the American imperialists running rampant and not treating Chinese people as human beings in Tianjin before liberation. At that time, American robber's jeeps often ran over Chinese people. Recalling these past scenes, Lu Xing'an said angrily: The Anglo-American imperialist jackals are once again harming the people of the Middle East. We liberated Chinese people must never sit idly by and watch our Arab brothers suffer the crimes of imperialism again.

Millions of pages poured out from the huge rotary printing press and the full-sheet printing press. In order to save time, many workers rushed the newly printed pages to the binding section; Wang Renshan, the director of the rotary workshop, also directly participated in the battle, carrying bundles of pages weighing forty-five pounds one after another. A large number of books were bound and needed to be cut before leaving the factory. Coincidentally, Wang Defang, the machine operator of the three-knife cutting process, was ill. The eight workers in the group were so anxious that they rubbed their hands. With the whole factory fighting tensely, how could the cutting process not complete its task on time? At this moment, Wang Enshen, the assistant machine operator, stood up and said: In order to support the struggle of the people of the Middle East, I will take over the work of the machine operator! With that, Wang Enshen walked into the seat of the three-knife cutter and started the machine. The workers in the group took their positions, carrying and cutting.

Batches of new books against Anglo-American aggression and supporting the people of the Middle East were printed and sent to the vast number of readers. In the five days from the 18th, the staff of this factory, in addition to the production plan, printed ten new books such as "Fully Support the Just Struggle of the People of Iraq and Lebanon", "Anglo-American Robbers Get Out", and "The End of the Traitors", totaling more than 960,000 copies. The workers who finished printing the books, just left the machines, put down their tools, and immediately picked up their pens to fight the aggressors. The workers put forward the slogan "Making a poem or a painting is like stabbing a sharp knife into the chest of the Anglo-American pirates; shouting a slogan will boost the morale of the Middle Eastern brothers." In just two days, the factory workers created 234 cartoons, 94 poems, 61 performances, and more than 1,300 large-character slogans. Many workers had never written poems, painted pictures, or performed plays before, but this time they also picked up pens, put on costumes, and joined the battle. Young worker Zhao Hailu had a low level of education and could not write anything, but this time he and his partners jointly wrote the comic dialogue "A Cornered Dog Will Jump Over the Wall" and the peep show "Anglo-Americans Get Out of the Middle East!" Typesetting worker Wang Minghua also participated in writing the living newspaper "Those Who Play with Fire Will Burn Themselves" for the first time. This young worker, who usually didn't like to talk, couldn't restrain the anger in his heart and automatically took on the role of Chamoun in the play.

In the Xinhua Printing Factory, the tide of anger protesting against the aggressors flowed in everyone's chest. Look! This is the warning the workers issued to the aggressors:

	The sound of defending peace cuts through the vast sky,
	We hold high the banner of peace, opposing Anglo-American aggression in the Middle East.
	What power makes the warmongers tremble?
	It is 600 million Chinese people.
	America get out of Lebanon, Britain get out of Jordan,
	Protest letters are like millions of missiles, flying towards the aggressors.
	We demand: Do not invade Lebanon and Jordan.

专栏：

    滚蛋，美英侵略者！
    本报记者　刘佩珩
    我们工人有力量，　　支援中东兄弟得解放；
    工厂是阵地，　　　　车间当战场。
    多出一本书，　　　就是多一颗子弹送前方；
    出书快一秒，　　　就是多增一份支援力量。
    美英帝国主义侵略中东的消息，激怒了首都新华印刷厂的全体工人，他们人人愤慨，个个抗议，坚决以自己的实际行动打击侵略者，支援阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。
    18日晚，作家出版社新的书稿“打断侵略者的脊骨”送来了。工人们一看，是反对美英侵略阿拉伯的诗文画集，都说这是作家、诗人向敌人斗争的“子弹”，一定要尽快地运到“前方”，二十多道工序的工人都不下班了，立即投入了争取每一秒钟的战斗。
    排字工人们从架工组组长那里领来原稿，马上开始行动，他们在林立的铅字架前，一边看着原稿，一边飞速地拣字，不到几分钟就全部排出来了。铅印车间老配框工人刘玉林等不及了，跑到活版车间打听排版的大小尺寸和规格，回去争先把配框搞好。浇铅板的工人光着背，守在化铅炉旁边，红红的火光照映在工人们的脸上，他们的汗珠成串地往下流，但他们擦都不擦，只顾紧张地浇铸铅板。青年工人贾世洪白天浇了一天的铅板，夜里还一直坚持工作，工段长傅文光几次催他休息，他说：为了支援中东人民，出点力气流点汗算什么！
    在隆隆开动的对开印刷机前，老工人路兴安正在同他的助手紧张地装卸活字板，他们采取交叉工作的办法，过去要作两、三个小时的工作，不到一个小时就完成了。这位年老工人，解放前在天津亲眼看见过美帝国主义者横行霸道、不把中国人当人，那个时候，美国强盗的吉普车经常压死中国人。回想起过去这些情景，路兴安愤慨地说：美帝国主义野心狼又去残害中东人民了，我们解放了的中国人民，绝不能眼看着阿拉伯兄弟再受帝国主义的罪。
    千万张书页从巨大的轮转印刷机和对开印刷机涌出来。为了抢时间，许多工人把刚印好的书页赶运到装订工段去；轮转车间主任王仁山也直接参加了战斗，他一次又一次地把四十五斤重的一捆捆书页背走。大批的书订好了，需要截切以后出厂，巧得很，切成工序三面刀领机王德芳病了，小组的八个工人急得直搓手，全厂的工人都紧张的战斗，切成工序怎能不按时完成任务？正在这个时候，领机助手王恩深从一旁站出来，说：为了支援中东人民的斗争，我来顶替领机的工作！说着，王恩深走进三面刀的坐位，开动了机器，小组工人们各就各位，搬的搬，切的切。
    一批批反对美英侵略支援中东人民的新书印制好了，送到了广大的读者面前。从18日起的五天内，这个工厂的职工们在生产计划之外，增印出“全力支持伊拉克和黎巴嫩人民的正义斗争”、“美英强盗滚出去”、“卖国贼的下场”等十种新书，共九十六万多册。印完书的工人们，刚离开机器，放下了工具，又马上拿起了笔杆，向侵略者作斗争。工人们提出“作出一诗、一画，就是一把尖刀刺进美英海盗的胸膛；呼出一句口号，中东兄弟斗志万丈高”的口号。仅仅两天的时间，全厂工人就创作出漫画二百三十四幅，诗九十四首，演出节目六十一个，大字标语一千三百多张。许多工人从来没有写过诗、画过画、演过剧，这次也拿起了笔，化了装，参加战斗。青年工人赵海禄文化低，不会写东西，这次他却和伙伴们共同编写出相声“狗急跳墙”和拉洋片“美英从中东滚出去！”排字工人王明华也第一次参加了编写活报剧“玩火者自焚”，这位平时连话都不爱讲的青年工人抑制不住心头的愤火，自动担任了剧中夏蒙的角色。
    在新华印刷厂里，向侵略者抗议的怒潮，流在每个人的胸膛。看！这是工人们对侵略者发出的警告：
    保卫和平的声音，划破万里长空，
    我们高举和平的大旗，反对美英侵略中东。
    是什么力量使战争贩子发抖？
    是六亿中国人民。
    美国滚出黎巴嫩，英国滚出约旦，
    抗议书像千万颗导弹，飞向侵略者。
    我们喝令：不准侵略黎巴嫩和约旦。（附图片）
