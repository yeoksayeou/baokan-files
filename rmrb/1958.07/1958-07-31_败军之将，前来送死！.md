    "A Defeated General Comes to Offer His Head!"
    Liu Baiyu
    When the American imperialists invaded Lebanon, they were, for a time, baring their fangs and brandishing their claws, shouting loudly, as if they were something special. However, a paper tiger is, after all, a paper tiger. After much deliberation, the vanguard turned out to be the 24th Division, which was annihilated in Korea, its division commander, Dean, even becoming a prisoner of war.
    This reminds me of a scene that deeply moved me not long ago during a mass demonstration:
    "The demonstrating masses of Peking University, singing their self-composed song 'American and British Imperialism's Towering Crimes,' stopped for five minutes outside the British Legation. Student representative Li Mingquan rolled up his sleeve, revealing his right arm, wounded in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. He stood tall, waved his left arm, and spoke with fervor and righteous indignation to the staff of the British Legation: 'We fought you in Korea, and we won; you lost! We love peace, but we are not afraid of war! We will not allow you to interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries. We demand that your invading troops immediately get out of Arab lands!' The two British people standing at the door of the Legation lowered their heads, not daring to look him in the eye."
    These were stern words, righteous pronouncements, a resounding battle drum. Faced with such iron historical facts, what could the aggressors do but lower their heads? According to White House officials, Eisenhower is now pacing back and forth in his office day after day, restless. It is precisely this wave of protests, like an ocean, surging and pounding against the gates of the aggressors, that makes them tremble with fear. Currently, the Soviet Union has proposed a summit meeting, and the United States is very afraid of sitting in the dock and being judged by the righteous people of the world.
    But this phenomenon is very worthy of our attention. Because all this increasingly illustrates the actual situation of imperialism's apparent strength but inner weakness, and its approaching end.
    Let us first take the Middle East as an example. How did the United States rely on money and cannons, conspiracies and traps, to arbitrarily trample on Arab lands, doing whatever it pleased? In Hershel Meyer's "The Last Illusion," there is such a bloody exposure: "In March 1950, Washington expressed its willingness to give Iran a $250 million loan to then Iranian Prime Minister Ali Razmara. According to the London 'Times,' Razmara told the then U.S. Ambassador to Iran, Grady, that he did not need American aid. In addition, he banned the rebroadcasting of 'Voice of America' anti-Soviet broadcasts in Tehran. A few weeks later, his body, riddled with bullets, was found. Similarly, the rulers of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Pakistan, who did not bow their heads, were quickly assassinated. ... On May 10, 1953, when Dulles sat down to negotiate with Egyptian dictator General Naguib, according to the 'New York Times,' he placed a .32 caliber automatic pistol on the table at the start of the negotiations, saying: 'This is a gift from your friend Dwight D. Eisenhower.'" Doesn't this vividly depict the robber-like, hooligan-like faces of Eisenhower and Dulles and their criminal black hands stained with blood? They rely on money and assassinations, reaping billions of dollars in pure profit in the Middle East every year, while plunging tens of millions of Arab people into the bloodbath of destitution and famine. However, time is moving forward, and the flames of awakening of the oppressed are burning. If they could arbitrarily plunder in the bloodbath they created at that time, such easy days are long gone. Even a British journalist cannot help but lament, "The old days cannot return!"
    But, for us, it is very interesting to see how the paper tiger performs its fangs-and-claws "heroic posture" in front of the people of the world. Amidst the cries of aggression in the Middle East, there are things like "emergency plans," "composite assault forces," and "strategic corps," which are truly grand and delightful. But when you tear it apart, the role that is dressed up so impressively turns out to be the defeated 24th Division under the hands of the righteous people. Even they themselves cannot help but blush with shame and have to admit that "the new 24th Division, led by General David Gray, was reorganized with the survivors of the division in the rearguard battles of the retreat in the summer of 1950 on the Korean Peninsula as its core." This is truly a bitter satirical drama. A paper tiger is, after all, a paper tiger. No matter how much the American bandits bluster, they can only piece together such inferior goods. For such a bandit army, we can only use the phrase commonly used in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms": "A defeated general comes to offer his head!" Those who did not find a grave in Korea will find one in Arabia. Facing this righteous tide sweeping the world, I don't think Gray's fate will be any better than Dean's. No wonder those American soldiers knelt on the docks and prayed to God for protection before boarding the ships to Lebanon, because their hearts were trembling, and they felt the black wings of death descending upon them.
    The name "paper tiger" is most appropriate for the American bandits. Usually, you see them glaring, charging around, full of vigor, but once they are on the front line and engage, they deflate like a dog-bitten bladder. I have personally seen and interrogated Americans on the Korean front. I remember a guy named Miller and another named Noble. They said that the most typical phrase in the U.S. military in the face of our powerful artillery fire is "Keep your head down!" And when you punish him with justice, he only knows to shamelessly reach out to you for cigarette butts to eat.
    History is stern and ruthless. Some say that history does not repeat itself. For the working people who are constantly creating a new world, it is always changing and unprecedented. But for the collapsing imperialism, the tragic history cannot help but repeat itself often. Think carefully, if the 24th Division will not get better results from the Arab brothers than from the Korean brothers, then Eisenhower today is just replacing MacArthur at that time. Now, let me end with their own words! When MacArthur's so-called Christmas offensive was completely defeated, a United Press reporter also reported that "a person was slowly pacing back and forth in a room on the sixth floor of the Dai-ichi Life Insurance Building in Tokyo with a pipe in his hand. This person was MacArthur." Look! From MacArthur's pacing then to Eisenhower's pacing now, it's still pacing back and forth. This also illustrates such a truth: you cannot sit firmly on a volcano. The exploiting class is bound to collapse, and imperialism can only move towards its doom. No matter how you pace back and forth, there is no other road. The iron fists of the righteous people can smash any vicious chains, and the awakened people will use the torch of truth to illuminate the road of historical progress. It is that sentence: "We fought you in Korea, and we won; you lost!" So, what about today? No matter how vicious you are, our answer is only one sentence, that is, the American army is bound to be defeated.

### “败军之将，前来送死！”

    “败军之将，前来送死！”
    刘白羽
    美帝国主义者侵入黎巴嫩，一时之间，张牙舞爪，叫嚣甚盛，仿佛真有什么了不起似的。但是，纸老虎终究是纸老虎，选来选去，先锋部队，原来就是在朝鲜被歼、连师长迪安也当了俘虏的二十四师。
    这使我想起不久前在群众示威中，那一个使我深受感动的镜头：
    “北京大学的示威群众，高唱他们自编的‘美英帝国主义罪恶滔天’的歌子，在英国代办处门外停了五分钟，学生代表李明权挽起袖子，露出曾在抗美援朝战争中负过伤的右臂，他挺起胸脯，挥着左臂，慷慨激昂地对英国代办处的工作人员说：‘我们在朝鲜和你们较量过，我们胜利了，你们失败了！我们爱和平，但也不怕战争！我们不允许你们干涉阿拉伯各国人民内政，我们要你们的侵略军立即从阿拉伯的土地上滚出去！’站在代办处门口的两个英国人，低着头，不敢正视他一眼。”
    这真是词严义正，战鼓堂堂。侵略者在这样的铁的历史事实面前，除了低下头来还有什么办法？据白宫官员说，艾森豪威尔现在是一天又一天地在他的办公室里踱来踱去，坐立不安。正是这样的抗议浪潮，像海洋一样汹涌澎湃地撞击着侵略者的大门，使他们不能不胆战心惊。目前，苏联倡议召开首脑会议，美国很害怕坐到那被告席上，去听候全世界正义人民的审判。
    但这一现象十分值得我们注意。因为这一切愈益说明帝国主义外强中干，日暮途穷的实际情况。
    就让我们先以中东为例来看一下吧！美国曾经怎样依靠着金元与大炮，阴谋与陷害，在阿拉伯土地上任意蹂躏，为所欲为。在赫歇尔·迈耶的“最后的幻想”中就有过这样一段鲜血淋淋的揭发：“1950年3月华盛顿曾向当时的伊朗首相阿里·拉兹马拉表示愿意给伊朗两亿五千万美元贷款。据伦敦‘泰晤士报’报道，拉兹马拉对当时美国驻伊朗大使格拉迪说，他并不需要美国援助。此外，他遂禁止在德黑兰转播‘美国之音’的反苏广播。几个星期以后，就发现了他那满身弹痕的尸体。同样地，没有俯首听命的黎巴嫩、叙利亚、约旦和巴基斯坦的统治者很快地被谋杀了。……1953年5月10日，当杜勒斯坐下来和埃及的独裁者纳吉布将军谈判时，据‘纽约时报’报道，他在开始谈判时就把一支三二糎口径的自动手枪放在桌上，说：‘这是你的朋友德怀特·戴·艾森豪威尔送的礼物。’”这不就活生生地画出艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯那一副强盗、流氓的嘴脸和他们那沾满血污的罪恶的黑手了吗？他们依靠金钱与暗杀，一年在中东掠获数十亿美元的纯利，而将几千万阿拉伯人民置于赤贫和饥馑的血泊之中。但是，时间在前进，被压迫者的觉醒的火焰在燃烧，如果说那时他们在他们制造的血泊中可以任意掠夺，而现在那样随心如意的日子早已过去了。连一个英国记者也不能不感慨地说“旧日子不可能复返！”
    但，对我们来说，非常有意思的是看纸老虎在全世界人民面前怎样表演那张牙舞爪的“雄姿”。在侵略中东的一片杀声中，什么“紧急计划”呀，“混成攻击部队”呀，什么“战略兵团”呀，真是煞有介事，不亦乐乎。可是拆穿来看，被装扮得神气十足的角色，原来是正义人民的手下败军二十四师。连他们自己也不能不羞恨得满面通红，只好承认“由戴维·格雷将军统率的新第二十四师是以1950年夏天在朝鲜半岛南退的后卫战中该师的残存者为核心整编而成的。”这真是一幕辛辣的讽刺剧，纸老虎终究是纸老虎，美国强盗任凭怎样虚张声势；原也只能拼凑出这样劣等货色。对于这样强盗军我们只能用“三国演义”里常用的那句话：“败军之将，前来送死！”在朝鲜没找到墓地的会在阿拉伯找到，面对这席卷全世界的正义怒潮，我看这个格雷的命运不见得会比迪安的好一点。难怪那些美国士兵，在登上赴黎巴嫩的舰艇前都跪在码头上祈祷上帝保佑，因为他们的心在战栗，他们预感到死亡的黑翼在朝他们降临。
    纸老虎这个名字，对美国强盗是再恰当不过的了。平时你看他们横眉竖眼，横冲直撞，劲头十足，可是一到火线一交手，就如同狗咬破的尿泡一样瘪了气。我在朝鲜前线亲眼看到过、也亲自审讯过美国人。我记得有一个叫密勒，一个叫诺勃，他们说在我们强大炮火面前美军中最典型的一句话就是“低下头来！”而当你以正义责罚他时，他却只知厚颜无耻地伸手向你讨烟蒂头吃。
    历史是严峻无情的。有人说历史不会重演，对于不断创造新世界的劳动人民来说，永远是日新月异，史无前例；但对于正在崩溃的帝国主义，悲惨的历史却不能不常常反复。仔细想想，如果说二十四师从阿拉伯兄弟那儿不会比在朝鲜兄弟那儿得到更好一些的结果，那么，艾森豪威尔今天也不过是代替了当时的麦克阿瑟而已。现在，还是让我用他们自己的话来结束吧！当麦克阿瑟所吹嘘的圣诞节攻势一败涂地时，合众社一个记者不也报道过“一个人手上拿着烟斗在东京第一大厦的第六层楼房间内慢慢地踱来踱去。这个人就是麦克阿瑟。”请看！从麦克阿瑟那时踱到艾森豪威尔这时，还是踱来踱去。这也说明这样一个真理，火山口上要坐也坐不稳的。剥削阶级必然要崩溃，帝国主义只有走向末日，任凭你怎样踱来踱去，其它的道路是不会有的。正义人民的铁拳能够砸碎任何毒恶的锁链，已经觉悟了的人民会用真理火炬照明历史前进道路。正是那句话：“我们在朝鲜和你们较量过，我们胜利了，你们失败了！”那么，今天呢，不管你们怎样穷凶极恶，但我们的回答只有一句，那就是美军必败。
