Women Are Liberated from Household Labor
    Hui Mingshen

During the season of summer harvest and planting, I visited the Dongsizhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshi County, Henan Province, which is famous throughout the country for inventing the "underground tile pipe irrigation canal."

This cooperative has had bumper wheat harvests for three consecutive years, and upon entering the village, one gets a brand-new impression. During my few days of visiting Dongsizhuang, I not only saw young and middle-aged women become the main force in production, but also elderly women over seventy years old were full of energy. The women sang with infinite joy, praising the happiness that socialism has brought them, and sincerely thanking Chairman Mao.

To be liberated from household labor was something women dared not even dream of in the past. But now the Dongsizhuang Agricultural Cooperative has kindergartens, nurseries, public canteens, power-driven steel mills for grinding flour, sewing groups, and shoe-making groups. Household labor, which was always borne by women, has been greatly reduced and rationally organized. If the abolition of the unreasonable feudal marriage system was a great liberation for women, then this is another great turnaround and a great happy event for women.

When I walked into the kindergarten here, a group of innocent and lively children surrounded me, took my hand and asked if I was well, and sang songs for me. The children in the kindergarten learned to sing, dance, and play the land boat game; they learned to pick up firewood, sweep the floor, and pull weeds; they understood manners. Although they don't have many toys, the children all come to the kindergarten on their own after finishing their meals.

The nannies in the nursery (baby-holding group) are all elderly women, and they treat the children as if they were their own. When it's time for breastfeeding, they send the children to their mothers' work places to be fed.

Dongsizhuang organized kindergartens last year, and now has two kindergartens and nine nurseries. Four educators and twenty-seven nannies are taking care of three hundred and twenty-five children, accounting for 94% of the children under six years old in the entire cooperative. Sending a child to kindergarten costs less than ten work points per month; for children in the nursery, it costs no more than the remuneration for three working days.

The canteen was only set up before the summer harvest, one for each of the ten production teams. As soon as the work bell rings, the members gather from the fields and threshing grounds to the canteen, buy their meals, and eat in family groups. While eating, they listen to news about construction projects across the country on the wired broadcast, as well as pleasant music. The team also uses mealtimes to read the newspaper to the members and assign production tasks.

When the canteen was first set up, most of the members warmly supported it, but some did not agree. Some elderly people thought that with so many people, the food would not be good and would not suit their tastes; some young women were still shy; and some were afraid that regardless of how much or how little they ate, the grain and money would be divided equally. The cadres explained to the masses why they were setting up the canteen, how they would manage it, and its benefits, and they did not force those who did not want to eat in the canteen. Some households did not participate at first, but after two days they all came. All three hundred and one households and one thousand six hundred and fifty people in the village, except for women in confinement and the sick, ate in the canteen. The members said with satisfaction that they didn't expect the food made in the canteen to be so delicious.

Eating in the canteen is very convenient. A canteen that feeds one hundred and fifty or sixty people only needs three or four cooks. Meal tickets are issued by household, and the cost of grain is based on how much is eaten.

Now, the women of the Dongsizhuang Cooperative no longer grind flour with millstones. Two steel mills driven by a diesel engine grind flour for more than 1,600 people in the entire village. This alone saves forty laborers and forty head of livestock.

Since its establishment, the sewing group has made more than 500 pieces of clothing for the members, and it only costs five and a half work points to make a set of clothes.

After solving the main household chores such as grinding flour, cooking, taking care of children, and sewing clothes, the women's labor force in the Dongsizhuang Cooperative was liberated, achieving full-time production. In the past, one hundred and twenty-seven full and half laborers who were tied to the home and often could not go to the fields for production, and one hundred and one people who could go to the fields but had to come home early or late due to household labor, now, most of them have joined production.

I visited the first row and second squad of the youth women's shock brigade. The squad leader, Liu Xian'e, told me that since the establishment of the shock brigade, no one has been absent once, and during the summer harvest, they rushed to work until twelve o'clock every night. They have helped five teams rush to harvest and plant.

With the liberation of women's labor, the cooperative's labor force has increased, and the family income of the members has also increased. Zhong Qiaofang, a member of the eighth team, has four children, and taking care of the children and cooking often prevented her from going to the fields. Even when she went, she always lagged behind others. Now, two of her children are sent to the kindergarten and nursery, and the family eats in the canteen. By the time of the summer pre-distribution, she had already earned more than 500 work points. She said: "I thought I would be stuck 'turning around the stove' all my life, who would have thought that I could walk out of the kitchen door today, it's really great." There are many people in situations like Zhong Qiaofang's.

When women talk about their current working life, they always like to compare it with the past when there were no canteens and nurseries, especially those with many children and large families feel this most deeply. They say that in the past, out of 360 days a year, they never had a good night's sleep. When they came back from the fields, they hurriedly cooked, the men urged them, and the children cried. They would get anxious and beat the children; the food was not on time, the men grumbled, and they had to grind rice and flour and do needlework every few days. They had to do these things continuously, rushing at night, always in a hurry. Now it's so much better, the children can be taken care of, and the adults can rest; they can hold meetings while eating, and they can listen to the radio; when they say they are going to work in the fields, they all go out together, no one needs to be called. Therefore, they all urgently request that the canteen be maintained and become a permanent fixture.

In the past, disharmony between sisters-in-law caused by housework was not uncommon. The family of Hou Qiaojin, a member of the first team, was like this.

Her family has fifteen people, and all three of her sisters-in-law have children. Before there were kindergartens, nurseries, and canteens, the three sisters-in-law took turns cooking, grinding flour, and carrying water. They couldn't take care of the children, they couldn't do needlework, and they were busy for a long time, and they couldn't even eat a comfortable meal. If the food didn't suit their taste, they would hear all kinds of gossiping. Qiaojin and her third sister-in-law accumulated a gap. From October of last year, they didn't talk to each other when they met. Since the establishment of the canteen, kindergarten, and nursery, Qiaojin's family has changed. The children are all in the kindergarten and nursery, the mother-in-law is helping in the canteen as a cook's helper, the family eats in the canteen, and they go to work in the fields together. Whenever the bell rings for mealtime, Qiaojin comes back early, buys the food and serves it to the children, and invites her third sister-in-law to eat. If her third sister-in-law comes back early, she is also busy buying food and taking care of the children. The family is harmonious, talking and laughing, and very affectionate.

The women love the kindergartens, nurseries, and canteens from the bottom of their hearts. They have summarized many benefits: they can gather together quickly and act quickly, they don't delay production, they don't get angry for no reason, they can eat well, they can rest, the children can be taken care of, and production can be improved. When they talk about these things, they naturally reveal a joyful and happy mood. (Attached picture)

    妇女从家务劳动中解放出来了
    惠明深
    在夏收夏种的季节里，我访问了因发明“地下瓦管灌溉渠”而著名全国的河南省偃师县东寺庄农业社。
    这个社连续三年小麦丰收，一进村庄就给人一种崭新的印象。在东寺庄访问的几天中，我不仅看到青年、壮年妇女成了生产上的主力，而且年过古稀的老大娘们也干劲很足；妇女们怀着无限的喜悦，歌颂社会主义给她们带来的幸福，衷心感谢毛主席。
    从家务劳动中解放出来，是妇女过去连想都不敢想的事情。但现在东寺庄农业社有了幼儿园、托儿所，有公共食堂，有动力带动的钢磨磨面，有缝纫组和做鞋组，一向由妇女承担的家务劳动大为减轻并得到合理组织。如果说废除了不合理的封建婚姻制度是妇女的一次大解放，那么这又是妇女的一次大翻身，一件大喜事。
    当我走进这里的幼儿园时候，一群天真活泼的小朋友围上来拉着我的手问叔叔好，唱歌给我听。孩子们在幼儿园里学会了唱歌、跳舞、撑旱船；学会了拾柴、扫地、拔草；懂得了礼貌。虽然他们没有很多的玩具，但孩子们都是吃罢饭就自己到园里来了。
    托儿所（抱娃娃组）的保育员都是老大娘，对待孩子和自己的一样。到吃奶的时候，就送孩子到妈妈劳动的地方喂奶。
    东寺庄从去年就组织了幼儿园，现在已有两个幼儿园、九个托儿所。四个教养员二十七个保育员照看着三百二十五个孩子，占全社六岁以下孩子的94％。孩子送到幼儿园，一月出不到十个工分；在托儿所里的小孩，最多也用不到三个劳动日的报酬。
    食堂是夏收前才办起来的，十个生产队每队一个。下工钟声一响，社员们就从地里、场上聚集到饭场上来，买上饭一家一堆的吃起来。一边吃着饭，一边听有线广播的祖国各地建设消息，悦耳动听的乐曲。队里还利用吃饭时间，给社员读报和布置生产工作。
    开始办食堂，大部分社员们热烈拥护，但也有不赞成的。有的老年人认为人多没好饭，不会合口味；有的年轻妇女还害羞；还有人怕不分吃多吃少，一样摊粮摊钱。干部向群众解释了为什么办食堂，怎么办法，它的好处，不愿意到食堂吃饭的也不勉强。起初有些户没参加，两天以后都来了。全村三百零一户一千六百五十人除了产妇和病人以外，都到食堂吃饭了。社员们满意地说，没想到食堂做的饭还满好吃呢。
    在食堂里吃饭很方便。一个管一百五、六十人吃饭的食堂，只用三、四个炊事员。吃饭发票，以户为单位，吃多少就出多少粮食。
    现在，东寺庄社的妇女已不再推磨磨面。用锅驼机带动着两盘钢磨磨面，供全村一千六百多人吃，光这一项就节省出来四十个劳动力，四十头牲口。
    缝纫组从成立以来，已给社员做衣服五百多件，做一身衣服只出五个半工分。
    解决了磨面、做饭、看孩子、缝衣服等主要家务劳动之后，东寺庄社的妇女劳力便解放出来，达到了全勤生产。过去缠在家里经常不能下地生产的妇女全、半劳力一百二十七人，能去地生产但因家务劳动的牵扯要晚出早归的一百零一人，现在，她们中的大部已经投入生产。
    我访问了青年妇女突击队的一排二班，班长刘仙娥告诉我，自从成立突击队以来，没人缺过一次勤，夏收中每晚都突击到十二点，她们帮助过五个队突击收、种。
    妇女劳力解放了，社里劳动力增多了，也增加了社员的家庭收入。八队社员钟巧芳有四个孩子，又看孩子又做饭，经常不能下地，即使去地也老是落到别人的后头。现在，两个小孩送到了幼儿园和托儿所，一家人在食堂里吃饭，到夏季预分截止，已做五百多工分。她说：“我想着‘锅台转’尽转一辈子了，谁想到今天还能走出灶房门，真好极啦。”像钟巧芳这样情况的是很多的。
    妇女们谈起现在的劳动生活来，总爱和没有食堂、托儿所以前比较，特别是那些孩子多、人口多的感受的最深刻。她们说，从前一年三百六十天，就没有睡过好觉，下地回来，连忙做饭，男人催，孩子哭，心急了就打孩子；饭不及时，男人嘟噜，几天一磨米和面，还有针线活。这都得打连晌，夜里赶，老是赶的慌。现在多好，孩子能照看好，大人也能休息了；吃着饭就能开会，还能听广播；说下地干活，一齐出动，谁也不用喊了。因此，她们都迫切地要求把食堂保持下来变成常年的。
    过去因家务劳动而造成妯娌之间不和睦的现象，也是不少的。一队社员侯巧金的家庭就是这样。
    她家十五口人，妯娌三个都有小孩。没有幼儿园、托儿所和食堂前，妯娌三个轮流做饭，磨面，担水。孩子顾不上哄，针线顾不上做，忙碌半天，还不能舒舒坦坦的吃顿饭。碰上做的不合口，还听七嘴八舌的闲话。巧金同三弟妹就这样积成了隔阂。从去年10月她们两人见面不打腔。自从成立了食堂和幼儿园、托儿所，巧金的家庭有了变化。孩子们都在幼儿园和托儿所里，婆婆在食堂里做炊事员的帮手，一家人都在食堂里吃饭，一起去地劳动。一到打钟开饭的时候，巧金回来的早了，就去买上饭给孩子们盛上，招呼三弟妹吃饭。她三弟妹回来的早了，也忙着去买饭和照顾孩子。一家人和气了，有说有笑，亲亲热热的。
    妇女们从心坎上爱幼儿园，托儿所和食堂，她们总结出许多好处：集合齐，行动快，不误生产，不生闲气，饭能吃好，还能休息，孩子能看好，生产能搞好。她们谈到这些时，都自然的流露出喜悦，幸福的心情。（附图片）
