The peace movement is a movement to prevent and treat the plague of war
Guo Moruo's speech at the Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference on July 18, 1958

Chairman, friends!

First, let me, on behalf of the Chinese delegation and the Chinese people, express my congratulations to the conference and express my gratitude and respect to the peace-loving Swedish people, the hosts of this conference.

Our Chinese delegation has come to Stockholm, the beautiful city of peace, with great pleasure. We have brought the peace wishes of the Chinese people and the firm determination of the Chinese people to defend peace and stop war.

We listened to Joliot-Curie's persuasive and detailed report at the conference, and we believe that this report can serve as the basis for the various discussions of this conference.

Many friends present today participated in the World Peace Conference held in Helsinki three years ago. Since that conference, the international situation has undergone many changes, and many friends are worried about the tension in the international situation. Some friends say this: Although good people all over the world demand the realization of peace and security, demand universal disarmament and the prohibition of the testing and use of nuclear weapons, and demand consultations between major powers and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems; however, the war group headed by Washington still adheres to the policy of strength and continues the Cold War, insists on expanding armaments and preparing for war, and insists on armed intervention in the independent movements against colonialism, so the tension in the world situation is not easy to ease. This analysis is correct. On July 15, the day before our conference opened, the U.S. military landed in Lebanon and carried out armed intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs. This new act of aggression facing the people of the world fully proves this point.

Our conference passed a solemn resolution against the US aggression against Lebanon on the first day of the conference. We truly represent the just voice of peace-loving people all over the world. Our conference and the representatives of various countries participating in the conference have fulfilled a part of their due responsibilities for the happiness of the people of the world and for the cause of peace. It is worthy of our mutual congratulations. But we should go further and make greater efforts to make the conference achieve more and greater achievements and lay a more solid and broader foundation for the cause of peace.

Here, let me briefly explain the root cause of war. I believe this can be permitted.

Two Camps' Attitudes Towards War and Peace

Our cause of peace is to oppose war and prevent war. War is the most serious plague for mankind. Therefore, our peace movement is also a movement to prevent the plague or treat the plague. To achieve this goal, we must explore the source of the plague and take fundamental measures to deal with the source. This is a matter of common sense and does not require medical experts to know.

So, what is the root cause of war?

Some say that the world has formed two camps, and these two opposing camps are suspicious of each other, engaging in the Cold War and the arms race, which may eventually lead to war. This should be said to be a view that only sees the symptoms of the disease but does not see the essence of the disease.

It is a fact that the opposition between the two camps has formed in the world, but there were no two camps during World War I. In the early stage of World War II, conflicts occurred between countries with capitalist systems. In the later stage, due to the participation of the Soviet Union and fighting alongside Britain, the United States, and France, the Axis powers that launched the war were defeated. Where can we see here that the opposition between the two camps can become the root cause of war?

Let’s compare the attitudes of the current two camps towards war and peace.

The Soviet Union has always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems in the international arena. The diplomatic policy pursued by New China is the policy of peaceful coexistence and the Bandung Principles.

Let's talk about the Soviet Union first! The Soviet Union fought alongside Britain, the United States, and France in World War II, becoming the main force against aggression, saving mankind from disaster, and defending human civilization. After the war, it was determined to carry out peaceful construction, restore war wounds, and always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems in the international arena, putting forward a series of specific peace proposals. Especially in recent years, it has gradually reduced its army by more than two million people. This year's military expenditure is 11 billion rubles less than in 1955, and it has automatically announced the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. Can't we see the Soviet Union's sincerity for peace from here?

Our China belongs to the socialist camp. Since the founding of New China, the diplomatic policy we have pursued has been the policy of peaceful coexistence. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence initiated by the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers in 1954 are known all over the world. Those five principles are: (1) mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty; (2) non-aggression against each other; (3) non-interference in each other's internal affairs; (4) equality and mutual benefit; (5) peaceful coexistence. This is the backbone of our peaceful diplomatic policy. The Bandung Conference expanded these five principles into ten principles, and the Cairo Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference also recognized the ten principles of the Bandung Conference. We believe that the relations between countries in the world should be based on these five or ten principles. If everyone abides by this criterion, then international cooperation will not be a problem.

In the past few years, we have also continued to reduce military spending and armaments. Since 1951, we have successively reduced the army by more than 2.7 million people. The proportion of military expenditure in the national budget has also become smaller year by year. It was 22.1% in 1955, 19.98% in 1956, 18.85% in 1957, and 15.12% in 1958. The military expenditure saved has been invested more in economic construction and cultural and educational construction. Our goal is to improve the material and cultural living standards of the people, and our national affairs are also vigorously advancing towards this goal.

Let me give another example of our efforts for the cause of peace, that is, our withdrawal of the Volunteer Army from Korea. In February of this year, the Chinese government and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reached an agreement to withdraw all the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea in batches before the end of this year. The first batch of 80,000 people was withdrawn before April 30; the second batch of 100,000 people was withdrawn from July 11 to August 20 this year, and is currently underway; the remaining 200,000 people will be withdrawn before the end of the year. Our Volunteer Army assisted Korea in repelling the American aggression. The United Nations, under the control of the United States, reversed black and white and condemned us as "aggressors." Has there ever been such an aggressor in the world?

The sincerity and efforts of China and the Soviet Union for peace are like this. All other ten socialist countries are actively reducing armaments and military spending and stepping up peaceful construction, and the achievements of construction are also progressing at an alarming rate.

So, what about the capitalist camp? Here I will only take the United States as an example.

The US rulers are hostile to peace, expanding armaments and preparing for war, not only refusing to withdraw troops from Korea, but also advancing troops to Lebanon.

The US military expenditure is expanding at an astronomical rate. On the eve of World War II, US military expenditure was only a little more than 1 billion US dollars, but this year it has reached 45 billion US dollars. The military expenditure in 1957 was 20% more than industrial investment. Where does this military expenditure come from? You can understand by looking at the US tax revenue situation. The tax revenue before the Second World War was 1 billion US dollars, but in 1957 it became 39 billion US dollars. It can be clearly seen that the wool comes from the sheep.

Non-productive military industries are constantly developing like malignant tumors, and peaceful production undertakings are constantly shrinking accordingly, leading to the most serious economic crisis at present. At present, the number of fully unemployed people in the United States has exceeded 5 million. In the past ten years, US prices have risen by 15%, and the currency has devalued. The vast majority of citizens have been affected in their lives. I say the vast majority only because a small number of people in the United States have benefited greatly from the expansion of armaments. The arms expansion and Cold War policies mainly serve the interests of this very small number of people. Let me give a few examples!

In the past two and a half years, 100 large US consortia have obtained 68% of the government's military orders, worth more than 30 billion US dollars.

The profit of "General Electric Company," the largest military contractor, increased from 177.7 million US dollars in 1947 to 500 million US dollars.

The profit of "United Aircraft Corporation," which produces military aircraft, increased from 16 million US dollars to 109 million US dollars in ten years.

The profit of "General Dynamics Corporation," which produces missiles, rockets, nuclear submarines, military aircraft, and other military equipment, increased from 1 million US dollars to 92 million US dollars in ten years. Enough, I don't want to give any more examples. Isn't this clear? Who does the US arms expansion and Cold War policy serve? It is for the profits of these large companies and shareholders. The lives of ordinary American citizens are being harmed, the happiness of people all over the world is being seriously threatened, and the responsible persons of the US government have to constantly intensify international tensions and even risk the world's disapproval to actually carry out aggression. This is not without reason. It is precisely for this reason that the US government is deeply afraid of the easing of the international situation, rejects any peace proposals that are conducive to easing the situation, and tries every means to cover up this truth and deceive the American people and the people of the world with various deceptions. They also often dress up as Santa Claus and give so-called "aid" to countries in need of assistance, but what is the essence of that aid? Of the 3.9 billion US dollars in foreign aid in 1958-1959, 3.1 billion US dollars were the prices of military equipment and military supplies. Santa Claus used such "aid" to put some countries that accepted US dollars on his chariot and gallop forward. Some rulers of countries that accepted US dollars therefore have the obligation to decorate Santa Claus more compassionately and even promote him as the savior. But what about the people of those countries? The current revolution in Iraq shows the people's attitude towards the so-called "US aid." The people will never easily launch a bloody revolution unless there is no way out. We can say that the revolution in Iraq was promoted by US aid and by the Eisenhower Doctrine.

The US rulers are not interested in peace, and they even hostile to the peace movement. "More cannons, less butter," this is what a minister of the US government said, how similar to Goebbels' tone! US President Eisenhower shouted loudly in this year's State of the Union address, asking the American people to be brave enough to "sacrifice"; Vice President Nixon added a note to the "sacrifice," asking Americans to shed blood, sweat, and tears.

The American people love peace. Everyone knows that President Eisenhower used empty checks of peace to win votes in both elections. Therefore, the rhetoric of peace is used more frequently by Mr. Eisenhower, Nixon, and Dulles than we do. They are actors sitting high on the chariot and singing the tune of peace. They can be regarded as "saying all the good things and doing all the bad things."

They not only refused to withdraw troops from Korea, but also advanced troops to Lebanon; they not only did not stop nuclear weapons tests, but also allowed US military aircraft to fly in the airspace of other countries with nuclear warheads. Recently, on July 5, the United States exploded another nuclear weapon on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean. This is the twelfth in a series of atomic explosions conducted by the US government in the Eniwetok area of the Pacific Ocean since this spring. They are busy building intermediate-range missile bases in the territories of member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization; they decided to arm the West German army with atomic weapons; and transported atomic weapons and rockets into Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, the territory of our country occupied by the United States.

The above is the attitude of the United States, the representative of the capitalist camp.

Please see, who is maintaining peace and who is plotting war!

Dear representatives, please compare the attitude of the US government with the situation of socialist countries fairly: Which side is working hard to maintain peace and which side is plotting war or even plotting an atomic war.

We don't want others to favor us, we only ask for fairness, and only ask people to look at the truth of the facts with an objective and scientific attitude. The root cause of war, where exactly, this should be clarified. Only when it is clarified can we prevent war and even eliminate war.

Blindly prescribing medicine without clarifying the source of the disease will not only not cure the disease, but sometimes it is very harmful to the patient. Our peace movement is a movement to prevent the plague of war, so we have the responsibility to clarify the root cause of the plague of war with an objective attitude, so that people all over the world know it clearly, so that we can prescribe the right medicine.

We are not against the American people or against the United States. What we oppose is the root cause of war - the US arms expansion policy and aggression policy, and the Cold War policy that serves the excessive profits of a few people. We hope that the US government will be more sensible and change that policy. That is not only for the happiness of the people of the world, but also for the happiness of the American people. What's wrong with freeing ourselves from that policy and living in peace with each other? Isn't it possible for more people to obtain greater happiness if big capitalists get less profit? Anyway, so much excessive profit cannot be taken into the grave! Isn't it better not to be a slave to profit and become a sinner of mankind?

The Power of the People Surpasses Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs

We have now entered the era of artificial earth satellites. If the warmongers must launch a war, it will be the premature demise of imperialism.

The gentlemen who are planning and promoting the arms expansion policy should be sober. We have now entered the era of artificial earth satellites. Intercontinental missiles can hit any region on the earth. This is not intimidation but a fact. If you must risk launching a war, those who get excessive profits will definitely suffer the most. Although they have more money than ordinary citizens, they will not have more lives.

To be honest, although we hate war, we will not be frightened by war. We must prevent the outbreak of the Third World War. The people of the world have the power to do it. But if the warmongers must launch a war, we firmly believe that it will be the premature demise of imperialism. The people will suffer great disasters, but the people are able to overcome any disaster.

The power of the people is endless, it surpasses any atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb. We have gained such an understanding based on our own experience. For more than 100 years, the Chinese people have suffered from the disaster of colonialism. Just a few years ago, our country was extremely poor and the people could not make a living. At that time, we could not hold our heads up when we saw Western friends. But in 1949, our people's revolution won victory and the people were liberated. The people's productivity and creativity were also liberated. In just eight or nine years, we have indeed done a lot of amazing things.

Take steel production as an example. Before liberation, our steel production was only 158,000 tons, which was really pitifully poor. But what is it now? This year's production can reach 10 million tons, and next year it will exceed 20 million tons. I don't want to exaggerate at all. We will soon exceed the production of the United Kingdom.

500 million farmers across the country are making great leaps forward in agricultural production. Water conservancy projects are being built all over the country. From October last year to April this year, the irrigated area has been expanded by 350 million mu, which is 110 million mu larger than the total irrigated area achieved in the thousands of years before liberation. At present, we are carrying out the comprehensive utilization project of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, and we are also considering melting the snow on the Tianshan Mountains to irrigate the Gobi Desert; the Ming Tombs Reservoir near Beijing has recently been completed. It can hold 60 million cubic meters of water. The original plan was to build it in five years during the third five-year plan period (1963-1967), but it was built in just five months this year, the first year of the second five-year plan. Many diplomatic envoys in China have visited this project, and some have also participated in the work on the construction site. They can all be our witnesses. I believe that some friends among the delegates attending the meeting have also visited this huge project.

We have also made many amazing achievements in industrial production. Here I want to recommend an article about China published by Mr. Frederick Ellis, a reporter for the British "Daily Express," on June 23 in that newspaper. Mr. Ellis visited China for a month. He saw a lot of things and believed that the progress of Chinese industry was "a miracle never seen or reported in the Western world, which is amazing by any standard." He therefore cursed the "US-directed" trade embargo, believing that the victims were Britain and the entire West. He said that Chinese engineers and technicians with high technology expressed to him "willing to export goods listed on the embargo list by Britain."

Mr. Ellis also believes that "this huge industrial red dragon" is really terrible. He is certainly not a communist, and he does not need to do voluntary publicity for us, but I want to ask Mr. Ellis not to be afraid. This "red dragon" will never embark on the road of imperialism. If Britain really needs Chinese goods "listed on the embargo list," we must abide by the principle of "equality and mutual benefit" to conduct fair transactions.

Although Mr. Ellis is cursing the "US-directed" trade embargo - this is Mr. Dulles' self-proclaimed clever way to block us, in fact, we want to thank the United States, especially that self-proclaimed clever Mr. Dulles. It is his blockade that has helped us enable us to regenerate ourselves and give full play to our high creativity and initiative.

Relying on self-reliance, we have not only broken through the US blockade economically, but also culturally.

The US has implemented a fairly thorough embargo policy against us. It not only blocked us economically, but also blocked us culturally. But we also want to thank it. Relying on our self-reliance, we have not only broken through its blockade economically, but also culturally.

We have made great progress in scientific research. Here I only want to give one example: The general purity of germanium, a semiconductor, only needs to reach 99.9999% to meet the specifications, but we have purified it to 99.9999999%.

Some Western friends worry that we are rejecting Western culture, which is not in line with the facts. We are not so stupid as to block ourselves culturally. We try our best to absorb everything that is good in the West. Taking the translation of Western books as an example, from October 1949, the day of the founding of the People's Republic of China, to June 1957, we translated a total of 18,539 books from 48 countries, with a print run of 300 million copies. Shakespeare's plays only had a few separate editions in the old Chinese era, but after the founding of New China, his complete works have long been published. Chinese theaters also regularly perform excellent plays from various countries, such as "Sakuntala," "Romeo and Juliet," "La Traviata," "Nora," and "A Servant of Two Masters." The ballet "Swan Lake" is currently being staged in Beijing. We have a certain confidence and hope that Western friends can appreciate it.

In short, the blockade of China is a successful policy of the US government, but who has it harmed? Mr. Ellis said that Britain and the entire West have been harmed. I think Japan in the East has also suffered a lot, but the situation in Japan is not so simple. Its people are from the East, and its government is from the West. Especially the current Nobusuke Kishi government, it faithfully obeys the US embargo policy, and it tore up the Fourth China-Japan Non-Governmental Trade Agreement. At the Chinese stamp exhibition held in Nagasaki in May this year, it also condoned people to tear up the Chinese national flag. Nobusuke Kishi said that this is only equal to tearing up a utensil. Nobusuke Kishi's hostility towards the Chinese people can be said to have reached its peak. This gentleman was a pioneer when Japan invaded China in the past, and served as a senior official in the so-called "Manchukuo." I estimate that the China in Nobusuke Kishi's eyes is probably still the China of more than ten years ago! Despite the fact that Japan is full of US military bases, his own potential imperialist consciousness has not diminished back then. What is most incomprehensible is that Japan is the only country that has directly suffered from atomic bombs. The Japanese people have also directly suffered from US hydrogen bomb experiments in the Pacific. However, the Nobusuke Kishi government allowed the US to import hydrogen warheads and rockets into Japan. What is the intention? This is completely contrary to the will of the Japanese people and seriously threatens the peace of Asia. We believe that the Japanese people will never remain silent.

Nobusuke Kishi tore up the China-Japan non-governmental trade agreement, but what was the result? Small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators in Japan, who had just breathed a sigh of relief for the past few years, have suffered severe blows again. It is said that many factories built and expanded for the purpose of trade with China have closed down one after another. Friends from the Japanese delegation attending the meeting naturally know this situation better than I do, so I will not prepare to say more. In short, Japan is also an example that has suffered from the embargo. This is completely certain.

Of course, we are happy to develop equal and mutually beneficial trade relations with any country. In the past few years, despite the blockade and embargo directed by the United States, our trade relations with various countries have still been developing year by year. If the trade volume in 1950 is taken as 100, then it reached about 260 in 1957. Although the trade volume with Western countries only accounts for a quarter, it is still larger than the total trade volume in any year in old China. We welcome Western countries to do business with us, but if you are unwilling to come, of course, it is not good to force you.

China has had amazing development in the few years since liberation. What is the reason? We don't want to hide it. The Chinese people are grateful to the Communist Party of China. It is the Communist Party of China that led the Chinese people to win the victory of the revolution, liberate the people, and liberate the people's productivity, thus creating almost unbelievable miracles. Of course, we also thank the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries. Based on the socialist spirit of mutual assistance, they have helped us selflessly in technology and other aspects. Our relationship has formed a new international relationship in human history. Based on our own personal experience, we have recognized the superiority of the socialist system. In this regard, we have absolute confidence.

If underdeveloped countries can get the selfless help of industrialized countries, it can promote economic development, but according to our experience, as long as the people's productivity is completely liberated, even if they do not get the selfless help of industrialized countries, underdeveloped countries can also get rapid development by relying on self-reliance. Weren't the current industrialized countries also underdeveloped countries many years ago? Some of them have taken the capitalist road and industrialized. Today, we are taking the socialist road to carry out industrialization. Our speed in fact shows that it is very fast. In this regard, the Chinese people believe that they have embarked on the correct road.

The Chinese People Eternally Need Peace

The Chinese people love peace. As long as colonialism exists, there will be no lasting peace in the world. Peace-loving friends should support the struggle against colonialism.

The Chinese people love peace. We know the value of peace. We should do many things in the future. In the cause of socialist construction, we eternally need peace. Based on our own experience, we are completely sympathetic to the anti-colonialism and the struggle for national independence. We believe that this movement does not conflict with the peace movement. We can assert that as long as colonialism exists, there will be no lasting peace in the world. The anti-colonialism and the struggle for national independence are developing vigorously in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is precisely a sign of the development of the peace movement. Some friends believe that the anti-colonialism and the struggle for national independence hinder the peace movement. We believe that this view is not comprehensive enough. The anti-colonialism movement is not simply a movement in colonies and semi-colonies, but should also become a movement within colonial countries. We believe that all friends who love peace should support anti-colonialism. We believe that the fate of colonialism will all end within ten or twenty years.

Here, please allow me to announce a piece of news: The government of our People's Republic of China has officially recognized the government of the Republic of Iraq. The full text of our Foreign Minister Chen Yi's telegram to Mr. Abdullah Jabbar Al-Jamail, Foreign Minister of the Republic of Iraq, is as follows:

"Your Excellency: I am delighted to hear of the birth of the Republic of Iraq. On behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, I would like to warmly congratulate the great victory of the Iraqi people. I am honored to inform Your Excellency that the Chinese government has decided to recognize the government of the Republic of Iraq. I firmly believe that the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Iraq and the people of the two countries will continue to develop on the basis of the Bandung Principles. The Chinese people will do everything possible to support your just struggle against imperialism and to defend national independence and freedom."

Our friends are all over the world. All peace-loving individuals and organizations are our friends. But we cannot deny the fact that there are some employees of war forces, although they are very few, they are full of peaceful rhetoric and full of compassion, but they have ulterior motives. Their usual trick is to confuse the root cause of war, and even reverse black and white. They sometimes help the war forces with small criticisms and big favors. We should not easily regard such pseudo-peacekeepers as friends. We still have to keep our eyes open and take a look at them.

The Chinese People's Firm Attitude Towards the "Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference"

Finally, before I end my speech, please allow me to summarize the Chinese people's attitude towards this conference.

We are completely in favor of disarmament. How to disarm should be discussed by the responsible persons of the countries concerned, and find some practical ways to implement them, even if it is a preliminary agreement, it must be implemented on the spot.

We are completely in favor of stopping nuclear weapons tests. We hope that the United States and the United Kingdom, which have nuclear weapons, will immediately stop such tests after the Soviet Union. The three countries should reach an agreement to permanently prohibit the use and production of nuclear weapons and destroy existing stockpiles.

We hope to carry out international cooperation in the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, especially economic and cultural exchanges on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and abolish economic and cultural blockades.

We are completely in favor of holding a summit meeting as soon as possible to discuss various issues related to easing the international situation.

We firmly support the conference's condemnation of the US aggression against Lebanon and demand that the US government immediately withdraw its troops invading Lebanon.

I wish the conference more and greater achievements, and I wish you all good health!

专栏：

    和平运动是预防和治疗战争瘟疫的运动
    郭沫若1958年7月18日在裁军和国际合作大会上的发言主席、各位朋友们！
    首先让我代表中国代表团和中国人民对大会表示祝贺，并向这次大会的主人——爱好和平的瑞典人民表示感谢和敬意。
    我们中国代表团以十分愉快的心情来到和平的美丽的城市——斯德哥尔摩，我们带来了中国人民的和平愿望，也带来了中国人民保卫和平制止战争的坚定的决心。
    我们在大会上听取了约里奥—居里的具有说服力的详细报告，我们认为这个报告可以作为本会各项讨论的基础。
    今天在座的很多朋友是参加过三年前在赫尔辛基举行的世界和平大会的，自从那次大会以后，国际局势又经过了许多变化，很多朋友为了国际形势的紧张而担心着。有的朋友这样说：尽管全世界善良的人们要求实现和平与安全，要求普遍裁军和禁止核武器的试验和使用，要求大国协商和社会制度不同的国家和平共处；但是以华盛顿为首的战争集团仍然坚持实力政策和继续冷战，坚持扩军备战，坚持对反殖民主义的独立运动进行武装干涉，因而世界局势的紧张不容易缓和。这一分析是正确的。本月15日，就在我们的大会开会前一天，美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆，对黎巴嫩的内政进行武装干涉，这一摆在全世界人民面前的新的侵略事实就完全证明了这一点。
    我们的大会在开会的头一天就通过了反对美国侵略黎巴嫩的庄严的决议，我们真正代表着全世界爱好和平的人发出了正义的呼声，我们的大会和参加大会的各国代表对世界人民的幸福、对和平事业尽了一部分应尽的责任，值得我们互相庆幸。但我们应该百尺竿头更进一步，作出更大的努力，使大会获得更多更大的成就，为和平事业奠定更坚实更广大的基础。
    在这里让我简单地说明一下战争的根源，我相信是可以得到允许的。
    两个阵营对战争与和平的态度
    我们的和平事业就是要反对战争，预防战争，战争对于人类是最严重的瘟疫，因而我们的和平运动也就是预防瘟疫、或者是治疗瘟疫的运动。要达到这个目的，那就必须探索瘟疫的病源，而对于病源进行根本的措施，这已经是常识的问题，不必等待医学专家才能知道。
    那末战争的根源究竟何在呢？
    有人说是世界形成了两个阵营，这两个对立的阵营互相猜忌、进行冷战和军备竞赛，因而有可能终于导致战争。这应该说是一种只看见疾病的症候而没有看到疾病的实质的见解。
    目前世界上形成了两个阵营的对立是事实，但是在第一次世界大战当时并没有两个阵营，第二次世界大战初期是在资本主义制度的国家之间发生冲突，后期由于苏联的参加与英美法并肩作战，才把战争的发动者轴心国打败了。在这里哪里可以看得出两个阵营的对立就可以成为战争的根源呢？
    再请比较一下目前的两个阵营对战争与和平的态度究竟是怎样。
    苏联在国际上始终倡导不同制度的国家和平共处。新中国奉行的外交政策是和平共处的方针和万隆原则。
    先谈苏联吧！苏联在第二次世界大战中和英、美、法并肩作战，成为反对侵略的主力，挽救了人类的灾难，保卫了人类的文明，在战后即锐意进行和平建设，恢复战争创伤，在国际上始终倡导不同制度的国家和平共处，提出一系列的具体的和平建议，特别是最近几年以来，逐次裁减了军队二百万人以上，今年的军费比1955年减少了一百一十亿卢布，而且自动宣布停止核武器的试验，我们从这里还看不出苏联的和平诚意吗？
    我们中国是属于社会主义阵营的，自新中国成立以来，我们所奉行的外交政策便是和平共处的方针。1954年中国和印度总理所倡议的和平共处的五项原则是全世界知名的，那五项原则就是：（1）互相尊重领土完整和主权；
  （2）互不侵犯；（3）互不干涉内政；（4）平等互利；（5）和平共处。这就是我们和平外交政策的骨干。万隆会议把这五项原则扩大成为十项原则，开罗亚非人民团结大会也承认了万隆会议的十项原则。我们认为世界各国的关系都应该以这五项原则或者十项原则为准则。如果大家都遵守这个准则，那末国际合作就不成问题了。
    这几年来我们也同样在继续裁减军备和军费，从1951年起我们陆续把军队裁减了二百七十万人以上，军费在国家预算中所占的比例也一年比一年小，1955年度是22.1％，1956年度是19.98％，1957年度18.85％，1958年度是15.12％。节省下来的军费多投资在经济建设和文教建设方面去了。我们的目的是提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平，我们的国家事务也就是在朝着这个目标大力推进。
    再举一个我们对于和平事业的努力吧，那就是我们从朝鲜撤退志愿军的问题。今年2月中国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府达成了协议，决定在今年年底以前分批全部把中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜。第一批八万人已于4月30日以前撤出；第二批十万人从今年7月11日到8月20日撤出，目前正在进行中；剩下二十多万人将于年底以前撤完。我们的志愿军援助朝鲜打退美国的侵略。联合国曾经在美国把持之下倒黑为白，谴责我们为“侵略者”，请问世界上曾经有过这样的侵略者吗？
    中苏两国对于和平的诚意与努力是这样，所有其他十个社会主义国家都在主动的裁减军备和军费而加紧进行和平建设事业，建设的成就同样是以惊人速度进行着的。
    那末资本主义阵营又是怎样呢？我在这里只举美国为例。
    美国统治者敌视和平，扩军备战，不仅拒绝从朝鲜撤兵，而且正在向黎巴嫩进兵。
    美国的军费是以天文数字的速度膨胀着的。第二次世界大战前夕，美国军费只十亿美元多一点，而在本年度已达到四百五十亿元，1957年的军事开支要比工业投资多20％。这些军费从何而来呢？看看美国税收情况就可以了解，二次大战前的税收是十亿美元，而在1957年度则成为三百九十亿美元，很明显地可以看出羊毛是出在羊身上的。
    非生产性的军事工业像恶性肿瘤一样不断地发展，和平生产事业不断地相应缩减，以致招致了目前最严重的经济危机。目前美国的完全失业者已超过了五百万人。最近十年间美国物价上涨了15％，货币贬值，绝大多数的公民在生活上都受到了影响，我说绝大多数只是因为美国有少数人在扩张军备中是得到了极大好处的，军备扩张和冷战政策主要就是为了这极少数人的利益在服务。请让我举几个例子吧！
    美国的一百个大型康采恩两年半来获得政府军事订货的68％，价值三百多亿美元。
    最大的军火承包商“通用电气公司”的利润由1947年的一亿七千七百万美元上升到五亿美元。
    生产军用飞机的“联合飞机制造公司”十年间的利润由一千六百万美元上升到一亿零九百万美元。
    生产导弹、火箭、原子潜水艇、军用飞机和其他军火的“通用动力公司”十年间的利润由一百万美元上升到九千二百万美元。够了，不想再举了。这还不明白吗？美国的扩军备战和冷战政策到底是为谁服务？就是为了这些大公司和股东们的利润。美国一般公民的生活在受着危害，全世界人民的幸福在受着严重的威胁，美国政府的负责人要不断加紧国际紧张局势、甚至不惜冒全世界的大不韪实际进行侵略，不是没有由来的。正是为了这样，所以美国政府深怕国际局势的趋向缓和，拒绝任何有利于缓和局势的和平建议，而且还要千方百计的掩盖着这个真相，用种种欺骗来蒙蔽美国人民和世界人民。他们还常常装扮成一个圣诞老人的样子，把所谓“援助”施舍给需要援助的国家，但那种援助的实质是怎样呢？在1958—1959年度的三十九亿美元外援中，有三十一亿是军备和军用物资的货价。圣诞老人就通过这样的“援助”把一些接受美元的国家套在他的战车上奔腾前进，有些接受美元国家的统治者因而有义务把圣诞老人粉饰得更加慈悲，甚至把它推崇为救世主了。然而那些国家的人是怎样呢？当前伊拉克的革命就表明了人民对于所谓“美援”的态度。人民不到毫无出路可走绝不会轻易发动流血革命，伊拉克的革命我们可以说就是美援促成的，就是艾森豪威尔主义促成的。
    美国统治者对于和平是不感觉兴趣的，他们甚至敌视和平运动。“更多大炮，更少牛油”，这就是美国政府一位部长说的话，多么像戈培尔的口吻啊！美国总统艾森豪威尔先生在今年的国情咨文中大声疾呼，要美国人民勇于“牺牲”；副总统尼克松先生为“牺牲”加了注释，要美国人流血流汗流泪。
    美国人民是爱好和平的。艾森豪威尔总统两次竞选都用和平的空头支票来争取了选票，这是大家都知道的事实，所以和平的辞令在艾森豪威尔、尼克松、杜勒斯先生们的口里用得比我们还要频繁。他们是高坐在战车上口唱着和平调的演员，真可以算是“好话说尽坏事作完”。
    他们不仅拒绝从朝鲜撤兵，而且正在向黎巴嫩进兵；他们不仅不停止核武器试验，而且让美国军用飞机带着核弹头在别国领空中飞行。最近7月5日美国又有一枚核武器在太平洋公海上爆炸了，这是美国政府自今春以来在太平洋恩尼威托克地区所进行的一系列原子爆炸的第十二次。他们正忙着在北大西洋公约集团、巴格达条约和东南亚条约成员国的领土上建立中程导弹基地；他们决定用原子武器武装西德军队；把原子武器和火箭运进了日本、南朝鲜和美国占领着的我国领土台湾。
    以上就是资本主义阵营的代表美国的态度。
    请看，谁在维护和平，谁在策动战争！
    亲爱的代表们，请公平地把这种美国政府的态度和社会主义国家的情况对比一下吧：到底哪一边在为维护和平努力，哪一边在策动战争甚至策动原子战争。
    我们不要别人偏袒我们，只要求公正，只要求人们用客观的态度、科学的态度来看看事实的真相。战争的根源究竟在哪里，这是应该弄清楚的，要弄清楚了，我们才能预防战争乃至消灭战争。
    不阐明病源而乱投药方不仅治不好病，有时对于病人反而是大有危害的。我们的和平运动是预防战争瘟疫的运动，那我们就有责任用客观的态度来阐明战争瘟疫的根源，让全世界人民都明白地知道，才好对症下药。
    我们并不是反对美国人民或者反对美国，我们所反对的是战争根源——美国的扩军备战政策和侵略政策，为少数人的超额利润服务的冷战政策。我们希望美国政府更明智一些，改变那种政策。那不仅是为了世界人民的幸福，同时也是为了美国人民的幸福。从那种政策中解放出来，大家和平共处，有什么不好呢？大资本家少得些利润不是可以使得更大多数的人获得更大的幸福吗？那样多的超额利润反正谁也不能带进坟墓里去！不要做利润的奴隶而成为人类的罪人不更好一些吗？
    人民的力量超过原子弹和氢弹
    目前已进入人造地球卫星的时代，如果战争狂人一定要发动大战，那就是帝国主义的提前灭亡。
    策划和推行扩军备战政策的先生们，是应该清醒一下的时候了。目前已进入人造地球卫星的时代，洲际导弹可以命中到地球上任何地区，这不是恫吓而是事实。如果一定要冒险发动战争，损失最大的一定是那些获得超额利润的人，他们比普通公民虽然有更多的金钱，但不会有更多的生命。
    老实说一句话，我们虽然憎恨战争，但也不会被战争吓倒。第三次世界大战我们是一定要制止它爆发的，世界人民有力量做到。但如果战争狂人一定要发动大战，我们坚决相信，那就是帝国主义的提前灭亡。人民是要受大灾难的，但人民是能够克服任何灾难的。
    人民的力量是无穷无尽的，它超过任何原子弹和氢弹，我们根据自己的经验得到了这样的认识。我们中国人民一百多年来是受着殖民主义的灾难的。仅仅几年前，我们的国家贫困不堪，人民不能聊生，那时我们见到了西方朋友是抬不起头来的，但是在1949年我们的人民革命胜利了，人民得到了解放。人民的生产力和创造性也得到了解放，仅仅八九年功夫，我们确实做出了不少的惊人事情。
    拿钢铁产量来说吧，解放前我们的钢铁产量只有十五万八千吨，真是贫困得可怜。但目前是怎样呢？今年的产量可以达到一千万吨，明年超过两千万吨，一点也不想夸大，我们很快就要超过英国的产量了。
    全国五亿农民正为农业生产而大跃进。全国都在兴修水利，自去年10月到今年4月扩大了灌溉面积三亿五千万亩，比解放前几千年间所达到的灌溉总面积还大了一亿一千万亩。目前我们正在进行着黄河与杨子江的综合利用工程，同时也在考虑着溶化天山上的积雪来灌溉戈壁沙漠；北京近郊的十三陵水库在最近建成了，它可以拦蓄六千万公方的水量，原计划是在第三个五年计划期内（1963—1967年）用五年工夫来建筑的，但在第二个五年计划的第一年的今年，仅仅费了五个月的工夫便把它建成了。在中国的外交使节很多去参观过这个工程，而且有的还参加工地的工作，他们都可以作为我们的证人。与会的代表中我相信也有一些朋友是去参观过这项浩大的工程的。
    我们在工业生产方面也有不少惊人的成绩。在这里我要推荐英国“每日快报”的记者弗雷德里克·埃利斯先生6月23日在该报发表的一篇关于中国的报道。埃利斯先生在中国访问了一个月，他看了不少的东西，认为中国工业的进展是“一种在西方世界从未见过也从未报道过的奇迹，用任何尺度来衡量都是惊人的”。他因而诅咒了“美国指使的”贸易禁运，认为受害的是英国和整个西方。他说，中国具有高度技术的工程师和技术人员向他表示“愿意输出英国列在禁运货单上的商品了”。
    埃利斯先生还认为“这条巨大的工业的红龙”实在可怕。他当然不是共产党员，他没有必要替我们作义务宣传，但我倒要请埃利斯先生不要害怕，这条“红龙”是绝对不会走上帝国主义的道路的，如果英国到了真正需要“列在禁运货单上”的中国商品的时候，我们是一定要遵守着“平等互利”的原则进行公平交易。
    埃利斯先生虽然在诅咒“美国指使的”贸易禁运——这是杜勒斯先生们封锁我们的自认为聪明的办法，其实我们倒要感谢美国特别是那一位自以为聪明的杜勒斯先生，是他的封锁帮助了我们，使我们能够自力更生发挥了我们的高度的创造性和积极性。
    我们依靠自力更生，不仅在经济上突破了美国的封锁，在文化上也突破了美国的封锁。
    美国对于我们的禁运政策是执行得相当彻底的，它不仅在经济上封锁我们，还在文化上也封锁我们，但同样要感谢它，就靠着我们的自力更生，我们不仅在经济上突破了它的封锁，在文化上也突破了它的封锁。
    我们在科学研究上已经有了很大的进展，在这里我只想举出一个例子：半导体的锗一般的纯度只要达到99.9999％就合乎规格了，但我们已经提纯到99.9999999％了。
    西方朋友有的人担心我们在排斥西方文化，那是不符事实的。我们没有那么蠢，要在文化上来封锁自己。凡是西方好的东西，我们是尽量吸收的。单拿翻译西方的书籍来说，从1949年10月，即中华人民共和国成立的那一天起到1957年6月，我们一共翻译了四十八个国家的一万八千五百三十九种书籍，印数是三亿册。像莎士比亚的剧本在旧中国时代只零星地出了几个单行本，但在新中国成立以后，已经把他的全集早就出全了。中国的剧场也经常在演出各国的优秀剧目，如“沙恭达罗”、“罗米欧与朱丽叶”、“茶花女”、“娜拉”、“一仆二主”等，目前在北京正在上演芭蕾舞剧“天鹅湖”。我们倒有一定的自信，希望西方朋友们能够去欣赏欣赏。
    总之对于中国的封锁是美国政府的得意政策，但它害到了谁呢？埃利斯先生说英国和整个西方都受了害，我看东方的日本也受害不浅，不过日本的情况是不那么单纯的。它的人民是东方的，政府是西方的。特别是目前的岸信介政府，它十分忠诚地服从美国的禁运政策，它把第四次中日两国民间的贸易协定撕毁了。在今年5月在长崎举行的中国邮票展览会上，还纵容人撕毁了中国的国旗。岸信介说，这只等于撕毁了一件用具。岸信介的敌视中国人民真可以说到了极点。这位先生是以前日本侵略中国时的一位急先锋，做过所谓“满洲国”的高级官吏，我估计岸信介眼中的中国大概还是十几年前的中国吧！尽管日本全国都布满了美国的军事基地，而他自己的帝国主义的潜在意识却仍然不减当年。最不能令人理解的是日本是直接受原子弹灾害的唯一的国家，美国在太平洋上的氢弹实验，日本人民也是直接受过危害的，然而岸信介政府却让美国把氢弹头和火箭输入了日本，这到底是什么用意呢？这是完全违背日本人民的意志并严重地威胁着亚洲的和平的，我们相信日本人民决不会沉默。
    岸信介撕毁了中日民间贸易协定，但其结果又是怎样呢？几年来刚刚喘得到一口气的日本中小工商业者又受到了严重的打击，听说好些以对华贸易为目的而兴建扩建的工厂又纷纷倒闭了，这情形参加大会的日本代表团的朋友们自然比我知道得更清楚，我就不准备多说了。总之日本也是受了禁运之害的一个例子，这是完全可以肯定的。
    当然我们是高兴同任何国家开展平等互利的贸易关系的，几年来尽管在美国指使的封锁禁运之下，我国和各国的贸易关系仍然在逐年发展。如果把1950年的贸易额作为一百，那末1957年便达到了二百六十左右，其中西方国家的贸易额虽然仅占四分之一，但比起旧中国任何一年的总贸易额都还要大些。我们欢迎西方国家来和我们做生意，但你们如果不愿意来，当然也不好勉强。
    中国自解放以来几年当中有了惊人的大发展，其原因何在呢？我们不想隐讳，我们中国人民是感谢中国共产党的，是中国共产党领导着中国人民获得革命的胜利，使人民得到大解放，人民的生产力也得到大解放，因而造成了几乎是难以置信的奇迹。当然我们也感谢苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家，他们本着社会主义的互助精神，大公无私地在技术上和其他方面帮助了我们，我们的关系在人类历史上形成了一个新的国际关系。我们根据自己亲身的体验就认识了社会主义制度的优越性。在这一点上我们是有绝对的自信的。
    不发达的国家如果能得到工业化国家的无私的帮助是可以促进经济上的发展的，但根据我们的经验，只要人民的生产力得到彻底的解放，即使得不到工业化国家的无私的帮助，不发达的国家靠着自力更生也可以得到迅速的发展。目前的工业化国家在若干年前不同样是不发达的国家吗？他们有的是采取资本主义的道路而工业化了，我们今天是在采取社会主义的道路来进行工业化。我们的速度在事实上表明着是非常迅速的，在这一点上我们中国人民认为是走上了正确的道路。
    中国人民永恒地需要和平
    中国人民是热爱和平的。殖民主义存在一天，世界上就不会有持久和平，爱好和平的朋友应该支持反殖民主义的斗争。
    我们中国人民是热爱和平的。我们知道和平的宝贵，我们今后还应该做许多的事，在社会主义的建设的事业中，我们永恒地需要和平。根据我们自己的体验，我们对于反殖民主义和争取民族独立运动是完全同情的。我们认为这种运动和和平运动并不冲突。我们可以断言有殖民主义存在的一天，世界上就不会有持久和平。反殖民主义和争取民族独立运动在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲正在蓬勃地发展，这正标志着和平运动的发展。有朋友认为反殖民主义和争取民族独立运动妨害了和平运动，这种看法我们认为是不够全面的。反殖民主义运动不单纯是殖民地和半殖民地的运动，同时也应该成为殖民国家内部的运动。凡是爱好和平的朋友，我们认为是应该支持反殖民主义的。殖民主义的命运我们相信在十年或二十年之内便会全部结束了。
    在这里请允许我宣布一个消息，我们中华人民共和国政府已经正式承认了伊拉克共和国政府。我们的外交部长陈毅致伊拉克共和国外交部长阿卜杜拉·贾巴尔·阿勒贾迈尔先生的电报全文是这样：
    “阁下：欣闻伊拉克共和国诞生，我谨代表中华人民共和国政府和人民热烈祝贺伊拉克人民的伟大胜利。我荣幸地通知阁下，中国政府已决定承认伊拉克共和国政府。我深信，中伊两国和人民间的友谊和合作关系将在万隆原则的基础上不断发展。中国人民将尽一切力量支持你们反对帝国主义、保卫民族独立和自由的正义斗争。”
    我们的朋友是遍于全世界的。一切爱好和平的个人和组织都是我们的友人。但是我们也不能否认这样的事实，有一些战争势力的雇佣者，虽然是极少数，他们是满口的和平辞令，满面孔的悲天悯人，然而是别有用心的。他们惯用的手法就是蒙混战争的根源，甚至颠倒黑白，他们对于战争势力有时是小骂大帮忙，这样的伪装和平者我们还不好轻易地看成朋友，我们还须得把眼睛放明亮一点，来看看他们。
    中国人民对于“裁军和国际合作大会”的坚定态度
    最后在我结束我的发言以前，请允许我综合一下中国人民对于本会的态度。
    我们是完全赞成裁减军备。如何裁法应该有关的国家负责人坐下来谈谈，找出一些切实可行的办法来，哪怕是初步的协议也好，总要立地见诸实施。
    我们完全赞成停止核武器试验，希望有核武器的美国和英国继苏联之后立即把这种试验加以停止。三国应该达成协议，永远禁止核武器的使用和生产，把现有的储存消毁。
    我们希望本着和平共处五项原则的精神进行国际合作，特别是在平等互利的基础之上进行经济交流和文化交流，废除经济和文化上的封锁。
    我们完全赞成尽可能早日召开最高级会议商讨有关缓和国际局势的各项问题。
    我们坚决拥护大会关于美国侵略黎巴嫩的谴责，并要求美国政府立即撤退侵入黎巴嫩的军队。
    祝大会获得更多更大的成就，祝各位健康！
