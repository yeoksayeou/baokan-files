Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 27th: China's automobile, tractor, agricultural machinery, internal combustion engine, and bearing industries have formulated three-year technical development outlines. The specific guiding principle is: "From less to more, with both cutting-edge technology and widespread application, filling the spectrum in terms of variety, and combining indigenous and foreign methods in terms of technology."

From July 15th to 24th, the Sixth Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building held an experience exchange conference in Tianjin on technical innovation achieved with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The conference included an exhibition of over 1,000 innovative achievements. More than 400 representatives from 130 units in five industries across the country, as well as industrial bureaus and machinery and electronics bureaus from various provinces and cities, exchanged experiences. Guided by the spirit of running enterprises through diligence and thrift, the conference formulated a three-year technical development outline that primarily relies on self-reliance to transform the landscape of these five industries.

This conference facilitated the exchange of experiences in technical innovation and new product trial-manufacturing, particularly sharing grassroots methods for solving key problems and experiences in combining indigenous and foreign approaches. Representatives from the automobile, tractor, and other industries, through the exchange, not only dispelled the myth that automobiles and tractors could not be manufactured, but also dispelled the myth that mass production was impossible.

In the three-year technical development outline formulated at the conference, based on the new situation of deep plowing and high yields emerging in China's rural areas, and the new needs that have emerged and will emerge after the industrial leap forward, it was decided that within three years, all varieties and specifications needed by the five industries in the development of China's industry and agriculture will be created and produced based on the summary of mass innovation and improvements to existing products. These varieties include various trucks with carrying capacities ranging from one ton to sixty tons in seven different weight classes, tilling machinery and harvesters capable of deep plowing to 50 centimeters and producing 2,000 to 4,000 catties of wheat per mu, filling the spectrum of tractors ranging from 5 to 250 horsepower within three years, and research work on solar-powered vehicles.

    我国汽车、拖拉机等工业
    制定技术发展纲要
    据新华社天津27日电　我国汽车、拖拉机、农业机械、内燃机、轴承工业制订了为期三年的技术发展纲要，具体方针是：“从少到多，有尖端有普及，在品种上填满型谱，在工艺上土洋结合”。
    7月15日到24日，第一机械工业部第六局在天津召开了多快好省技术革新经验交流大会。大会附设了一个有一千多件革新创举的展览会。全国五个行业和各省市工业厅、机电局的一百三十多个单位的四百多个代表在一起交流经验。会议本着勤俭办企业的精神，订出了以自力更生为主、改变这五个行业面貌的三年技术发展纲要。
    这次大会交流了技术革新和试制新产品的经验，特别是交流了解决关键问题的土办法和土洋结合的经验，汽车、拖拉机等工业的代表，通过交流，不少人在破除了不能制造汽车、拖拉机的迷信以后，又破除了不能成批和大量生产的迷信。
    在大会制订的三年技术发展纲要中，根据我国农村出现了深耕、高产的奇迹的新形势和工业跃进后已经出现和将要出现的新的需要，决定在三年以内，把我国工农业发展中需要五个行业解决的所有品种、规格，在总结群众创造、改进旧产品的基础上，全部创造和生产出来。这些品种有一吨到六十吨的七个级位的各种载重汽车，深耕五十公分、亩产二千斤到四千斤小麦的整地机械和收获机等，三年内填满五到二百五十马力各种拖拉机的型谱，和以太阳能为动力的汽车的研究工作。
