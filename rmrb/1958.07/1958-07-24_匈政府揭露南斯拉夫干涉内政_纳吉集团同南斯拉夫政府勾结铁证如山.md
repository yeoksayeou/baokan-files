Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 23rd: Newspapers here today published a note from the Hungarian Embassy in Belgrade, entrusted by its government to the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs. This note uses irrefutable facts to provide a stern rebuttal to the Yugoslav government's "protest" note of June 23rd to the Hungarian government regarding Hungary's execution of the traitor Nagy Imre.

The Hungarian note first points out that the sentencing of the traitor Nagy Imre and his accomplices by the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government is entirely a matter of Hungary's internal affairs, and no other country's government, including the Yugoslav government, has the right to interfere.

The Yugoslav government's note insisted that the Hungarian Ministry of Justice's announcement regarding the sentencing of Nagy and others, which mentioned the Nagy treasonous group's connection with the Yugoslav Embassy, was "baseless." The Hungarian note lists a series of facts demonstrating that as early as the spring of 1955, officials of the Yugoslav Embassy in Budapest had formal contacts with members of the Nagy group, which later developed into secret contacts of a conspiratorial nature. In these contacts, members of the Nagy group handed over several documents written by Nagy to officials of the Yugoslav Embassy, keeping them secret from Hungarian government organs, explaining the reactionary political goals of this group. Between October 23rd and November 4th, 1956, Losonczy, one of the main members of the Nagy group, was entrusted by Nagy to secretly meet with the then-Yugoslav Ambassador to Hungary, Soldatic, five times, to discuss "further actions to be taken" based on secret intelligence, thereby openly interfering in internal affairs. After the counter-revolutionary riot was suppressed, Nagy and his accomplices also issued instructions to the remaining counter-revolutionary elements in Budapest to continue their counter-revolutionary conspiracies through the Yugoslav Embassy staff, and with the help of Yugoslav journalists in Budapest, spread messages to "Radio Free Europe." Furthermore, at the request of the Yugoslav Embassy, Nagy and his accomplices formulated a new political program and strategy for seizing power.

The Yugoslav government's note of June 23rd also shamelessly slandered the Hungarian government, claiming that the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government had failed to ensure the "personal safety" of these counter-revolutionary elements and had failed to leave their crimes unpunished in "violation" of "promises." The Hungarian note firmly refutes this slander. It points out that the Hungarian government has not violated any "promises." The note lists facts showing that the so-called "exercise of the right of asylum" by Nagy and his accomplices at the Yugoslav Embassy was actively instructed by the Yugoslav Ambassador to Hungary at the request of Belgrade, and that the Yugoslav Embassy's actions were an abuse of diplomatic privileges, clearly interfering in the internal affairs of the host country. International law does not recognize the right of diplomatic missions to grant asylum to people in the host country. Regarding the so-called "promise" issue, the note points out that the Hungarian government only made the following promise in November 1956: that it would not punish members of the Nagy group for actions known up to that point. The crimes of Nagy and his accomplices were gradually clarified by Hungarian criminal and judicial organs subsequently. Moreover, the Yugoslav officials who negotiated with the Hungarian government at that time had already accurately understood the true nature of the activities of Nagy and his accomplices. The Hungarian note points out that, based on these facts that have been revealed, the Yugoslav government's claim of "breach of promise" is self-defeating.

The note concludes by stating that the Hungarian government most strongly rejects the Yugoslav note and views it as yet another unreasonable attempt to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs.

    匈政府揭露南斯拉夫干涉内政
    纳吉集团同南斯拉夫政府勾结铁证如山
    新华社布达佩斯23日电　此间报纸今天公布了匈牙利驻贝尔格莱德大使馆受本国政府委托转给南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处的照会。这份照会用铁的事实对南斯拉夫政府6月23日就匈牙利处决叛徒纳吉·伊姆雷问题给匈牙利政府的“抗议”照会作了严正的驳斥。
    匈牙利的照会首先指出，匈牙利工农革命政府对叛国犯纳吉·伊姆雷及其同谋者的判决完全是匈牙利的内政问题，任何其它国家政府，包括南斯拉夫政府在内，都不能加以干涉。
    南斯拉夫政府的照会曾经硬说匈牙利司法部关于判决纳吉等人的公告中提到的纳吉叛国集团同南斯拉夫大使馆有联系的话是“没有根据”的。匈牙利的照会列举一系列事实说明：早在1955年春季，南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯大使馆的官员就同纳吉集团分子有着正式的联系，随后又发展成为阴谋性质的秘密联系，在这些联系中，纳吉集团分子把纳吉所写的几篇对匈牙利政府机关保守秘密的、说明这一集团的反动政治目的的文件交给了南斯拉夫大使馆的官员。在1956年10月23日到11月4日之间，纳吉集团主要分子之一洛松齐曾受纳吉的委托，五次去同当时的南斯拉夫驻匈牙利大使索尔达蒂奇等进行密谈，根据秘密情报讨论了“进一步要作的事情”，从而公开干涉了内政。在反革命暴乱被镇压后，纳吉及其同谋者还通过南斯拉夫大使馆人员对布达佩斯市的反革命残余发出继续进行反革命阴谋的指示，并且在南斯拉夫大使馆帮助下通过南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯记者向“自由欧洲电台”传播消息。此外，纳吉及其同谋者还在南斯拉夫大使馆的要求下，制定了夺取政权的新政治纲领和策略。
    南斯拉夫政府6月23日的照会还无耻地诬蔑匈牙利政府，硬说匈牙利工农革命政府没有能够保证这些反革命分子的“人身安全”和使他们的罪行不受惩罚是“违背”了
  “诺言”。匈牙利的照会坚决驳斥了这种谰言。它指出，匈牙利政府并未违背任何“诺言”。照会列举事实说明：所谓纳吉及其同谋者到南斯拉夫大使馆“行使避难权”乃是南斯拉夫驻匈牙利大使根据贝尔格莱德的要求主动指使他们这样作的，而南斯拉夫大使馆这样作是一种滥用外交特权的行为，显然是对驻在国内政的干涉。国际法并不承认外交代表机构有权给予驻在国的人以避难权。关于所谓“诺言”的问题，照会指出，匈牙利政府在1956年11月只作过这样的诺言，即不因为到当时为止所了解到的纳吉集团成员的行为而惩办他们。而匈牙利的刑事和司法机关对纳吉及其同谋者的罪行是随后逐步查清的。而且当时同匈牙利政府谈判的南斯拉夫人士早已准确地了解了纳吉及其同谋者的活动的真正性质。匈牙利的照会指出，根据已揭发出的这些事实，南斯拉夫政府所谓“违背诺言”的说法就不攻自破了。
    照会最后说，匈牙利政府最强硬地拒绝南斯拉夫的照会，并把它看作是再一次无理干涉匈牙利内政的企图。
