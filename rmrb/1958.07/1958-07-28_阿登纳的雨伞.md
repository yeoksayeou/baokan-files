	Adenauer's Umbrella
	Tie Yi

	The United States decided to show his West German lackeys who was boss, because they dared to murmur about the master's acts of aggression. Dulles flew to Bonn in the rain on the 26th. The lackey chief Adenauer hurried to the airport in the rain to greet him. United Press International said triumphantly: "Adenauer exceptionally personally greeted an official of lower rank than himself." Who doesn't know that for a lackey, even if the master's dog comes, he must treat it like a god, let alone the number two man who has come to interrogate them?

	It is said that as soon as Dulles got off the plane, more than a hundred lackeys rushed to surround him. The eighty-two-year-old lackey hurried forward and used his umbrella to shield Dulles from the rain. Flattering, he said: "I now want to let America receive my protection." Dulles gave the lackey a little comfort, saying, "It is good for all of us to stand together when it rains." The lackey was overwhelmed by favor and quickly said: "There is an old saying in the East that when it rains, happiness comes."

	The eighty-two-year-old hag is selling smiles at the door, which can be regarded as one of the aspects of Western civilization. However, a United Press International reporter was a bit of a spoilsport, saying that "these two people are saying these things in an attempt to cover up an obvious fact: they are not in complete agreement on the issue of American Middle East policy." Then, under the impact of the storm, how long can Adenauer's umbrella last?

    阿登纳的雨伞
    铁衣
    美国决定要给他的西德奴才们一点颜色看了，因为他们竟敢在主子的侵略行为上说些闲言闲语的。杜勒斯在26日冒雨飞到了波恩。奴才头阿登纳赶快冒雨到机场去迎接。合众国际社洋洋得意地说：“阿登纳破例亲自迎接一个官职比他低的人”。谁不知道，在奴才来说即使主子的狗跑来了，也得当神敬，何况前来的是二号头目，又是为问罪而来的呢？
    且说杜勒斯一下飞机，一百多名奴才们赶快围了上去，八十二岁的奴才赶快趋步向前，用手里的雨伞给杜勒斯挡着雨。献媚说：“我现在要让美国受我的保护。”杜勒斯给了奴才一点抚慰，说“在下雨的时候站在一起对我们大家都有好处。”奴才受宠若惊，赶快又说：“东方有一句老话，叫作雨来幸福来。”
    八十二岁的老货倚门卖笑，这也算是西方文明之一吧。不过，合众国际社的记者有点煞风景，说是“这两个人讲这些话，是企图掩饰一个显而易见的事实：他们对美国中东政策的问题上，并不完全一致。”那末，在暴风雨的打击下，阿登纳的雨伞又能支撑多久呢？
