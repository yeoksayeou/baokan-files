    Digging Up the Roots of Specialization Ideology
    Chen Xiuying, Secretary of the Cloth Yard Branch of the CCP, Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill

    In the past, I wasn’t very good to the masses. Every time we had a meeting, it was just criticism: criticism for not completing the plan, criticism for falling behind, even criticism for perming hair. For example, on the issue of perming hair, I said it was a manifestation of bourgeois ideology, but I myself had permed my hair. The masses said behind my back: "She has a mouth to criticize others but no mouth to criticize herself; cadres are really a bit special." Usually, I rarely spoke to the masses and always wore a stern face. When I went into the workshop, I would put on a long face first. I thought "the look enters the door before the person" was being serious. This "criticism" plus "long face" made the masses unwilling to see me. When they saw me, they would turn their faces away. Some said, "Look at her face, as if we owe her eight million." The masses also didn't come to me to talk about problems. They said, "If the talk goes well, it goes well. If it doesn't, we'll inevitably be criticized. Everyone is several decades old; it's not worth it."

    I knew that the masses were dissatisfied with me and had made many self-criticisms in the past. But I thought that the reason my work wasn't thorough was that I was busy. You say I'm a subjectivist, but wasn't I just trying to do a good job, not for personal gain? Therefore, repeated self-criticisms didn't solve the problem.

    After the rectification campaign started, the Party committee told us to change our leadership style and implement "three togethers and three familiarities," so I also did "three togethers and three familiarities." After I regularly went down to labor, the masses reflected: "Taking so much money a month, it's right that you should labor." In the past, the masses said I had a stern face and didn't smile. Later, I nodded and smiled at everyone I saw. As a result, the masses said it was fake, just putting on an act. I thought: I've done what the higher-ups told me to do, and the masses still say I'm not good. It's clear that there's a problem with the masses' thinking.

    Recently, the whole factory had a major discussion on theory and a major discussion on opening hearts. The Party committee said to me: "The masses have opinions about you. Why don't you examine yourself and see what the problem is, say what's in your heart, encourage the masses to also say what's in their hearts, untie the ideological knots between the leaders and the masses, and improve relations." I sat down and thought for several days, examining myself from beginning to end. With the help of the Party committee, I finally figured out the problem. The problem is that after I became a cadre, especially since 1954, when I became the leader of the cloth yard, I thought that to be a comprehensive leader, I had to look the part, have some "flavor." In life, my clothes had to be more elaborate, a little different from others. In short, I thought that being a cadre required specialization; if you weren't a bit special, you wouldn't look like a cadre. Why specialize? Did socialist books say so? Did the Party teach that? Neither did. I further realized that there were two roots to my specialization ideology: First, when I worked in the old society, I saw that the "foreman" was very imposing. He didn't work, didn't stay up all night, and earned more money, and he spoke "seven loud and eight roaring." I had thought that if my father, a machinist, hadn't died, if he had pulled some strings, maybe he could have become a foreman. My style was a bit influenced by the "foreman" of the old society. "Foreman" is a way of managing people, and I had a bit of the idea of managing people. Second, after liberation, I joined the Party in 1950, became a full-time cadre in 1951, and was both a branch secretary and a member of the Party committee. Everything went smoothly in politics, and I also achieved a lot in my work. With political progress, I forgot the Party's cultivation. With achievements in work, I forgot the efforts of the masses. I wrote all the credit to myself, so I became arrogant and complacent, and presumptuous. In addition, I was the eldest daughter at home, and people listened to me. I wore new clothes, which planted the root of "specialization" in me. The above reasons, like ropes, tied up my thinking one by one, suspending me in mid-air, separated from the masses.

    After this examination, I was shocked and also happy. I had completely cleared out the old stuff, and I felt relieved.

    I told the masses all these thoughts. The masses said: "This time you've really spoken your heart," "This kind of self-criticism sounds like real talk." They also gave me many valuable suggestions.

    Now the situation has changed. In the past, when I went down to labor, the masses said "it's what you should do." Now they are afraid that I'll get tired and say, "Take it easy, you're a novice, I'm experienced, you can't compare with me." In the past, the masses would turn their faces away when they saw me. Now they actively come to me to talk about problems. Now, I also actively participate in recreational activities, performing the Cai Lian Chuan (colored lotus boat) for the masses to see. The masses are very happy. They say: "The secretary has really put down her airs!" "In the past, we performed for the leaders to watch; now the leaders perform for us to watch. It's changed! We must work hard!" "As long as you integrate with us, we don't have any significant opinions."

    My mood has also changed. Originally, I thought that I couldn't stay in the cloth yard any longer. Now I think that the cloth yard can still be managed well.

### 挖掉了特殊化思想的根子

    挖掉了特殊化思想的根子
    中共武昌第一纱厂布场支部书记　陈秀英
    过去我对群众很不好，一开会就是批评：计划完不成批评，落后批评，烫发也批评。比如烫发问题，我说这是资产阶级思想的表现，其实我自己也烫了发。群众背后说我：“有嘴说人家，无嘴说自己，干部真有点特殊。”平常我很少跟群众说话，老是板着脸。要进车间的话，就先把脸垮下来。“人不进门相进门”我还以为这是严肃。“批评”外加“垮脸”，使群众都不愿见我，看到我就把脸一转，有的说：“看她那个相，好像那个差她八万”。群众也不找我谈问题，他们说：“谈得好就好，谈得不好少不了挨批评，大家都是几十岁的人，犯不上。”
    群众对我不满，我也知道，过去曾作了不少检讨。但我以为工作不深入是因为我工作忙；说我主观主义吧，我并不是为了个人，还不是想把工作搞好？因此，屡次检讨并不解决问题。
    整风开展后，党委叫我们转变领导作风，实行“三同、三化”，我也就“三同、三化”。我定期下去劳动后，群众反映说：“一月拿那么多钱，该劳动的。”过去群众说我是板着脸不笑，以后我见了人就点头，就笑，结果群众说是假的，装样子的。我想：上面叫我做的，我都做了，群众还说我不好，可见是群众思想有问题。
    最近全厂上下大论务虚，大谈交心，党委跟我说：“群众对你有意见，是不是检查一下，看问题到底在那里，把自己心里话说出来，启发群众也说心里话，解开领导与群众之间的思想疙瘩，搞好关系。”我坐下来想了好几天，前后检查一下，再加上党委帮助，问题到底想出来了。问题是，我当了干部之后，特别是自1954年起，我当了布场的领导人，我便以为当一个全面领导人，就要像个样子，有点“味道”；在生活上，衣服要穿得讲究一些，跟人家不同一点。总而言之，认为当干部要特殊化，不特殊一点，就不像个干部样子。为什么要特殊化？社会主义书本子里这样说了吗？党这样教育了吗？都没有。我进一步想到我存在特殊化思想的根子有两条：第一，在旧社会做工的时候，看到“头佬”很神气，不做工，不熬夜，拿的钱又多，说起话来“七呼八吼”。我曾想过，我父亲是个机工，要是不死，活动活动，或许也可以当个头佬。我的作风就有点受旧社会“头佬”的影响，“头佬”是一种管人的作风，我就有点管人的思想。第二，解放后，我1950年入党，1951年脱产，又是支部书记，又是党委委员，政治上一帆风顺，工作上成绩也不少。政治上进步，我忘记了党的培养，工作上有成绩，忘记了是群众的努力。我把账都写在自己头上，因此骄傲自满，妄自尊大。再加上我在家里是长女，话听我的，衣服穿新的，给我种下了“特殊化”的根子。以上的原因，就像绳子一样，一道一道地把我的思想捆起来，悬到半空中，脱离了群众。
    通过这样一检查，我大吃一惊，同时也高兴，算是把老底子统统清出来了，心里也舒畅了。
    这些思想我都跟群众讲了。群众说：“这回算说了心里话”，“这样检查才像个话”。他们还给我提了不少宝贵的意见。
    现在情况变了。过去下去劳动，群众说“该做的”，现在生怕我累了，说：“慢点吧，你是生手我是熟手，不能跟我比。”过去群众见我就车脸，现在都主动找我谈问题。现在，我还积极参加文娱活动，表演彩莲船给群众看，群众很高兴，他们说：“书记的架子真的放下了！”“过去我们演给领导看，现在领导演给我们看，变了，我们要好好干呀！”“只要跟我们打成一片，我们也没有什么了不起的意见。”
    我的心情也变了。原来我认为布场呆不下去了，现在我想，布场还是可以搞下去的。
