    A July 11th editorial in the "New York Herald Tribune" regarding interference in Lebanon's internal affairs stated: The people of the Middle East are sensitive to the issue of colonialism. Therefore, a "political initiative originating in Ankara and Baghdad will have a much greater effect than one bearing the trademarks of 'Made in Washington' or 'Made in London'..."

    Can the Baghdad Pact's trademark really conceal colonialist intervention? The people of the Middle East have long seen clearly that the Baghdad Pact is an aggressive tool bearing the trademarks of the US and Britain. Without the US and Britain winding it up, Ankara and Baghdad cannot put forward any significant political initiatives. Therefore, for years, the movements of the Baghdad Pact have become an indicator for the people of the Middle East to observe the aggressive intentions of the US and Britain. The "New York Herald Tribune" still wants to use this group to cover up its ugliness today, which can only achieve the completely opposite result.

    The people of the Middle East not only look at the "trademark" of initiatives, but also understand the essence of all kinds of "initiatives." No matter how the colonialists' conspiracies are disguised, they will be resolutely resisted by the people of the Middle East.

### 更换“商标”

    更换“商标”
    “纽约先驱论坛报”7月11日的一篇关于干涉黎巴嫩内政的社论说：中东人民对于殖民主义问题是敏感的，因而，进行干涉的“政治创议开始于安卡拉、巴格达，要比带有‘华盛顿制’或‘伦敦制’的商标的效果大得多”……
    用巴格达条约集团的商标就能掩饰殖民主义的干涉吗？中东人民早已看得很清楚，巴格达条约集团是一个贴着美、英的商标的侵略工具。美英不开动发条，安卡拉和巴格达是提不出任何重要政治创议的。因此，几年以来，巴格达条约集团的动向就成为中东人民观察美英侵略意图的指示器。“纽约先驱论坛报”今天还想用这个集团来遮丑，是只能得到完全相反的结果。
    中东人民不仅要看创议的“商标”，而且也洞察各种各样“创议”的实质。殖民主义者的阴谋不管怎样伪装，都要遭到中东人民的坚决的反击。
