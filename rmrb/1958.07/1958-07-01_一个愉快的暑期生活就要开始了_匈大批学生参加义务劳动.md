Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 29th: Approximately 1.4 million students from universities, middle schools, and primary schools throughout Hungary have begun or are about to begin a happy summer vacation. The Central Committee of the Hungarian Communist Youth League and the Central Council of the Free Trade Unions have arranged rich and active summer activities for the students, and have especially organized them to participate collectively in voluntary labor.

Among university and middle school students throughout Hungary, children of workers and peasants account for more than 53%, and they generally maintain good labor habits. This year, 4,000 university and middle school students (half of whom are university students) have responded to the call of the Communist Youth League and will go in batches to swampy areas and Danube River dam construction sites for two weeks of voluntary labor.

During the summer vacation, most students whose families live in rural areas will return home to participate in seasonal agricultural labor such as summer harvesting, and some will also support other agricultural production cooperatives, state farms, or machine tractor stations. Some students have signed contracts with state farms and agricultural production cooperatives, participating in labor every summer vacation.

In addition, many university students participate in labor in various service industries during the summer vacation. Some go to sanatoriums as service personnel, or go to rest homes to organize recreational activities.

The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League also assists students from various schools and foreign universities in exchange trips and exchange internships. Currently, 20 universities and colleges in Hungary have established such connections with schools in countries such as East Germany, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union.

Senior students in Hungarian primary schools will also engage in social welfare labor under the initiative and organization of the Young Pioneers, and carry out activities such as visiting places of interest, collecting specimens, and making teaching aids.

    一个愉快的暑期生活就要开始了
    匈大批学生参加义务劳动
    据新华社布达佩斯29日电　匈牙利全国一百四十万左右大、中、小学学生已经开始或者即将开始愉快的暑期生活。匈牙利共产主义青年团中央委员会和自由工会联合会中央理事会为学生们安排了丰富活跃的暑期活动，并且特别组织他们集体参加义务劳动。
    匈牙利全国的大、中学生中，工农子弟占53％以上，他们一般都保持有良好的劳动习惯。今年，大、中学生已经有四千人（其中一半是大学生）响应了共青团的号召，将分批轮流到沼泽地和多瑙河堤坝工地去进行两周的义务劳动。
    暑期中，大部分家在农村的学生都回家去参加夏收等季节性的农业劳动，有的还去支援别的农业生产合作社、国营农场或机器拖拉机站。有的学生同国营农场和农业生产合作社订了合同，每到暑假就去参加劳动。
    此外，还有不少大学生在暑期中参加各种服务性行业的劳动。有些到疗养院去当服务员，或者到休养所去组织文娱活动。
    共青团中央还协助各校学生和各外国大学学生交换旅行和交换实习。现在，匈牙利已经有二十个大、专学校同民主德国、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、苏联等国的学校建立了这种联系。
    匈牙利小学生中的高年级生也将在少先队倡议和组织下从事社会公益劳动，并且进行参观名胜古迹、收集标本、制作教具等活动。
