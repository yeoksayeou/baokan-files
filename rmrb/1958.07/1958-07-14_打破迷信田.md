    "Break the Superstition Field"
    (Our Dispatch) Kunming - Yunnan Province is universally experimenting with small-scale, ultra-high-yield "Break the Superstition Field."

    This pioneering initiative was proposed by the CCP organizations in various parts of Yunnan based on the new situation. This year, after Yunnan overcame a severe drought, there is great hope for high-speed production increases. A considerable number of counties are expected to reach the target of 800 jin per mu for grain production as outlined in the National Agricultural Development Program. In order to prevent complacency among cadres and the masses, to educate the masses not to regard 800 jin as the peak of the Great Leap Forward, and to guide the masses to liberate their thinking so as to organize even greater leaps forward, and also to accumulate experience for large-scale bumper harvests, the local Party committees believe that creating exceptionally high yields through experimentation is an important method for breaking superstition and preventing the idea that production has reached its limit.

    This type of "Break the Superstition Field" being experimented with has been developed on the basis of the original "experimental fields." Various localities have adopted a method combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and farmers. According to different natural conditions, one or several crops are selected for high-yield experiments. Currently, Dali, Yiliang, Puer and other counties have decided to harvest 10,000 jin of grain on one mu of land this year. Jianhsui, Xundian, Fuyuan and other counties in sweet potato producing areas are determined to create the miracle of 100,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. In the mountainous counties of Rongfeng, Luoping, Malong, and Shizong, the yield of corn per mu should reach 3,000 to 8,000 jin. The flue-cured tobacco being tested in Fuyuan, Yiliang, Luoping and other counties is required to produce 1,500 to 2,000 jin per mu, and the three mu of sugarcane being tested at the Lujiang Farm in the subtropical area strives to achieve a yield of 500,000 jin per mu. Other counties have also made plans for "Break the Superstition Fields" to greatly exceed general yields.

    In order to achieve such ultra-high yields, many special production-increasing measures have been adopted for the "Break the Superstition Fields." (Chen Zheng)

    “打破迷信田”
    本报讯　云南省普遍试种小面积特高产量的“打破迷信田”。
    这个创举是中共云南各地党组织根据新的情况提出来的。今年云南战胜了严重的干旱后，高速度地增产大有希望，相当一部分县今年即可达到农业发展纲要粮食亩产八百斤的指标。为了防止干部和农民群众可能产生的自满情绪，教育群众不要把八百斤看作是跃进的顶点，引导群众解放思想，以便组织更大的跃进，同时也为大面积丰产积累经验，各地党委认为通过试验创造特高产量，是打破迷信和防止增产到顶思想的一个重要的方法。
    试种的这种“打破迷信田”，是在原有“试验田”的基础上发展起来的。各地都采取了领导干部、技术人员和农民三结合的办法。根据不同的自然条件，选择一种和几种作物进行高产试验。现在大理、宜良、普洱等县决定今年要各在一亩土地上收获万斤粮。红薯主产区的建水、寻甸、富源等县，立志创造亩产十万斤红薯的奇迹。榕峰、罗平、马龙、师宗等山区县，包谷的亩产量要达到三千至八千斤。富源、宜良、罗平等县试种的烤烟，要求亩产一千五百斤至二千斤，亚热带地区的潞江农场，试种的三亩甘蔗更力争每亩产量达到五十万斤。其它各县也都对“打破迷信田”作出大大突破一般产量的计划。
    为了达到这种特高产量，“打破迷信田”都采取了许多特殊的增产措施。　　　（陈铮）
