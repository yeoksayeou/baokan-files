Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: TASS, New York, July 22nd: The Yemeni delegation distributed a letter from Yemen's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Rahim, to the President of the Security Council, requesting the Security Council to take note of Britain's new acts of aggression against Yemen.

The letter also listed many other facts illustrating the aggression by British troops. The Yemeni representative pointed out: From May 6 to May 8, 1958, British troops shelled and attacked Qataba in southeastern Yemen, destroying the Fatna Nasiriyah School and the customs house near it, as well as many other buildings, causing many casualties.

The Permanent Representative of Yemen to the United Nations emphasized that Britain's aggression against Yemen "is fundamentally unjustified. Britain is carrying out this aggression in order to achieve its goals through intimidation and violence."
