    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has successfully concluded the three-year economic recovery phase following the restoration of peace. Starting this year, it enters a new period of long-term, planned economic development. The main task of this new period is to develop and transform the national economy in a socialist direction, gradually building Vietnam from a backward agricultural country into an advanced, prosperous, and powerful socialist industrial nation.

    Vietnam is rich in natural resources, with the North possessing abundant mineral deposits. However, during the French colonial rule, imperialists only cared about extracting cheap resources and dumping French goods for high profits, resulting in a very underdeveloped Vietnamese industry. Moreover, under colonial rule, national industry could not develop at all. Vietnam had no heavy industry and lacked even industries producing light industrial goods like matches and cigarettes. In 1939, one year before the Japanese imperialist invasion of Indochina, there were only thirty-five industrial and mining enterprises in the entire North Vietnam, employing 50,000 workers. Before withdrawing to the South in 1955, French colonialists extensively looted, removed, and destroyed the most important components and raw materials of various enterprises. Even this meager industry was severely damaged, leaving almost all enterprises in the newly liberated areas paralyzed. This illustrates that the recovery and development of Vietnamese industry is an arduous task.

    In the early stages of economic recovery, due to limited capital and technical expertise, unclear resource conditions, and the urgent need for daily necessities among the people, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam determined that the development strategy for industry would prioritize light industry and daily necessities, to meet the needs of people's lives and production, and to accumulate capital and train personnel for heavy industry. Over the past three years, the people of North Vietnam, following this correct strategy, combined with the recovery and development of agriculture and other areas, and with the assistance of fraternal countries, have made tremendous efforts in the recovery and construction of industry and achieved remarkable successes.

    Since the restoration of peace, North Vietnam has almost entirely restored its old industrial and mining enterprises. Among them, many important industrial and mining enterprises, such as the Nam Dinh Textile Factory, the Hong Gai Coal Mine, and the Haiphong Cement Factory, have added new equipment and expanded. The eighteen industrial and mining enterprises originally in the liberated areas during the war of resistance, such as the Tran Hung Dao Machinery Factory, the Hoang Van Thu Paper Mill, and the Quan Trieu Coal Mine, have also been consolidated and developed, changing their original crude state in the war environment and greatly improving productivity. Among them, the Tran Hung Dao Machinery Factory has almost entirely replaced its equipment with new machinery.

    While restoring and expanding old enterprises, nearly fifty new enterprises have been built or are under construction, including some enterprises with modern equipment and technical levels far exceeding those before the war. By the end of 1957, Vietnam had seventy-eight state-owned enterprises, a number far exceeding the number of enterprises during French rule. The Hanoi Machine Tool Plant, completed in April this year, is the first modern machine manufacturing factory in Vietnamese history. From then on, Vietnam had its own modern machine manufacturing base.

    In terms of output, North Vietnamese industry has also grown rapidly in the past three years. The production of many important products has caught up with or exceeded the level of 1939 before the war. For example, the production of cotton cloth and cotton yarn in 1939 was only 20 million meters and 9,000 tons, respectively, but in 1957 it reached 27.2 million meters and 9,500 tons. The total industrial output value, taking 1954 as 100, had increased to 7227 by 1957. The proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value reached 33.1% by 1957. It is particularly noteworthy that the socialist economy has greatly developed and is growing stronger. Taking the output value of state-owned industry in 1955 as 100, it was 608 in 1956 and 934 in 1957. In 1958, the output value of state-owned industry will further develop, increasing by 53% compared with 1957.

    Small-scale industry and handicrafts occupy a significant position in the Vietnamese national economy. Under the strong support of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, they have rapidly recovered and developed in the past three years. In 1957, the output value of small-scale industry and handicrafts was equivalent to the value of 1.87 million tons of rice, more than four times the highest output value of small-scale industry and handicrafts in 1941 during French rule. In 1957, handicrafts accounted for 59% of the total industrial output value. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, Vietnamese small-scale industry and handicrafts are moving towards collectivization. There are already 5,430 production cooperatives organized by handicraft producers in North Vietnam.

    Another achievement in industrial recovery and construction is the growth of technical expertise. In the past, under the long-term rule of French colonialists, it was not only difficult to find Vietnamese senior engineering and technical personnel in Vietnamese factories and mines, but even skilled technical workers were very few. In order to solve this acute problem in industrial construction, the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government have taken many effective measures. In the past three years, a total of 7,000 technical cadres, 8,500 skilled workers, and tens of thousands of other workers have been trained.

    The vigorous development of economic recovery and construction in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam vividly illustrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. In South Vietnam, industry and handicrafts have not only failed to recover in the past three years but have also experienced serious closures and production cuts under the invasion of US monopoly capital. As the economic crisis in South Vietnam deepens, the people of South Vietnam are increasingly longing for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the call for peaceful reunification is growing louder and louder.

    越南民主共和国三年来工业恢复建设工作的成就
    越南民主共和国已经胜利地结束了和平恢复后三年来的经济恢复阶段，从今年起，开始进入新的时期，即长期有计划地发展经济的时期。新时期的主要任务是：要按社会主义方向努力发展和改造国民经济，逐渐把越南从落后的农业国建成一个工农业发达的先进富强的社会主义工业国。
    越南的天然资源很丰富，越南北方有着丰富的矿藏。但是，在法国殖民者统治时期，帝国主义者只顾大量攫取廉价资源和倾销法国商品以获得高额利润，因此越南工业非常落后。同时，在殖民者的统治下，民族工业根本得不到发展，越南不但没有自己的重工业，而且连生产火柴、纸烟等轻工业品的工业也没有。在日本帝国主义侵入印度支那前一年——1939年，整个越南北方只有三十五个工矿企业，五万名工人。1955年法国殖民者在撤往南方之前，大肆劫运，搬走和破坏了各企业中最主要的机件和原料。连这一点微薄的工业也遭到了严重破坏，使新解放区的企业几乎全部陷于瘫痪状态。这说明越南工业的恢复和发展是一项艰巨的工作。
    越南在经济恢复初期，由于资金和技术力量都有限，资源情况不明，人民群众又急需日用必需品，因此越南民主共和国在开始恢复经济时，确定在工业方面的发展方针是优先发展轻工业和日用品工业，以解决人民群众生活和生产的需要，为重工业积累资金和培养人材。三年以来，越南北方人民按照这个正确的方针，结合农业和其他方面的恢复发展和在兄弟国家的援助下，在工业的恢复建设工作中作出了巨大的努力，并且取得了显著的成就。
    从和平恢复以来，越南北方已经几乎全部恢复了旧有的工矿企业，其中，南定纺织厂、鸿基煤矿、海防水泥厂等许多重要工矿企业还增添了新的设备和扩建。在抗战时期解放区原有的陈兴道机器厂、黄文树造纸厂、关潮煤矿等十八项工矿企业，也得到了巩固和发展，改变了原来在战争环境中的简陋状态，大大地提高了生产率。其中，陈兴道机器厂几乎全部换装了新式机器。
    在恢复和扩建旧有企业的同时，有近五十个新企业已经建成或正在建设，其中包括一些技术水平远远超过战前的现代化设备的企业。到1957年底为止，越南已经有七十八个国营企业，这个数目大大超过了法国统治时期的企业数目。今年4月落成的河内机器厂，是越南有史以来的第一个现代化的机器制造工厂。从此，越南有了自己的现代化机器制造业的基础。
    在产量方面，越南北方工业在过去三年中也有迅速的增长。很多重要产品的生产都已经赶上或超过了战前1939年的水平。例如棉布和棉纱的生产，1939年的产量只有二千万公尺和九千吨，1957年已经达到二千七百二十万公尺和九千五百吨。工业总产值，如果以1954年为一百，1957年已经增加到七千二百二十七。工业产值在工农业总产值中的比重到1957年已经占33.1％。特别值得注意的是社会主义性质的经济有很大的发展，并且在日益壮大。如果以1955年的国营工业产值为一百，则1956年是六百零八，1957年是九百三十四。1958年，国营工业的产值将有进一步的发展，它将比1957年增长53％。
    小型工业和手工业在越南国民经济中占相当重要的地位，在过去三年中在越南民主共和国政府的大力扶植下迅速地得到了恢复和发展。1957年，小工业和手工业的产值相当于一百八十七万吨大米的价值，超过法国统治时期小工业和手工业产值最高的1941年的产值四倍多。在1957年工业总产值中，手工业产值占到59％。越南小工业和手工业在国营经济的领导下，正在走向合作化的道路，越南北方手工业生产者组织起来的生产合作组已经有五千四百三十个。
    工业恢复建设工作的另一成就是技术力量的增长。过去，在法国殖民者的长期统治下，越南的工厂、矿山里不仅很难找到越南自己的高级工程技术人员，甚至连熟练的技术工人也是非常少的。为了解决这个在工业建设中的尖锐的问题，越南劳动党和政府采取了许多有效的措施。三年来，共培养和训练出了七千名技术干部、八千五百名技术工人和成万名的其他工人。
    越南民主共和国战后经济恢复建设工作的蓬勃发展，生动地说明了社会主义制度的无比的优越性。在越南南方，工业和手工业在过去三年中不但没有恢复，而且在美国垄断资本的侵略下，发生了严重的倒闭和减产的情况。在南越经济危机日益加深的情形下，南越人民更加向往越南民主共和国，要求和平统一的呼声愈来愈响亮。（新华社）
