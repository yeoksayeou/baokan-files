A former Red Army soldier, now studying hard.
Student Zhang Huanchao, revolution takes the lead.
Once a Red Army man, now in university.
Decades of revolution, never boasting of merits;
When it comes to frugality, he should be at the top.
People saw he had money, advised him to buy a watch,
But he bought a ball and sent it to a primary school.
Works hard at learning, achieves excellent results.
His attitude is humble, everyone praises him.
Responding to the call of the Youth League, learn from Zhang Huanchao:
Serve the people wholeheartedly, be both Red and expert.

This is a quick verse composed by Huang Zepei, a university student at Wuhan University. This verse summarizes Zhang Huanchao's arduous and simple life, his diligent study, and his transformation from a Red Army soldier and illiterate into a university student.

**An Excellent University Student from a Peasant Background**

Zhang Huanchao is now forty-one years old and a fourth-year student in the History Department of Wuhan University. He will graduate this summer. From his first year to his fourth, his academic performance has consistently been excellent. He has passed every course in the History Department, with the majority of his exam scores being four out of five, and many even reaching five. Last year, his academic paper "The Development of China's Textile Industry After the First World War" was praised by professors.

Zhang Huanchao not only excels academically but is also actively involved in various political movements. As the Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch of the History Department, he highly values ideological and political work. When right-wing elements launched a frenzied attack on the Party last year, attempting to seize leadership of higher education institutions, he bravely stood up to defend the Party's interests, leading the masses in the struggle against right-wing elements. During the "Double-Anti" movement, in order to run a socialist university well and cultivate talents who are both Red and expert, he actively helped teachers improve their teaching. He exposed many facts and criticized bourgeois viewpoints in teachers' teaching. He also wrote an open letter criticizing lecturer Shi Quan's objectivism in teaching.

In his life, he has maintained a hard-working and simple style for more than seven years. Out of his monthly allowance of forty yuan, in addition to meals, he never spends recklessly or buys new clothes, still wearing his old military uniform. Over the years, he has used his savings to buy basketballs, books, and stationery, which he sent to primary schools in his hometown of the Dabie Mountains. During the anti-waste struggle, his classmates organized an exhibition of his simple luggage and old clothes. The Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League specially organized university students in the Wuhan area to visit and called on students to learn from Comrade Zhang Huanchao's spirit of thrift and hard work.

**Aspiring to Conquer the "Cultural Fortress"**

In 1950, Comrade Zhang Huanchao was transferred from the army to a local position due to poor health. Before leaving, the leaders and comrades told him with concern: "Comrade Huanchao, for nearly twenty years, you have experienced the Long March and the Southern and Northern Wars during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. You have also been wounded. Now that your health is not very good, you should not overwork yourself after returning to the local area and should take good care of yourself." When he returned to his long-lost hometown, Zhangshihe Village in Hong'an County, the villagers and friends who came to see him also advised him with concern: "Now that we have won, since the year you left home for the Long March, the Kuomintang reactionaries burned down the houses, and your mother narrowly escaped death, finally waiting for you to return. She is now very old, and you must not go far away again!"

Comrade Zhang Huanchao could not listen to the words "return home to enjoy life." He had a grand ideal of conquering the cultural fortress, an ideal that had been hidden in his heart for a long time. As early as the War of Liberation, when he was a gunnery instructor, he once went to a company, and the gunners enthusiastically asked him some artillery knowledge. Zhang Huanchao had never gone to school, so how would he understand trigonometry! At that time, he couldn't say a word, and his face was burning. Late at night, after the soldiers had fallen asleep, Zhang Huanchao tossed and turned, unable to sleep. The questions the soldiers had asked him were still swirling in his mind. He thought: "I can assemble a disassembled rifle or pistol with my eyes closed, and I have also commanded troops in battle, but these experiences are no longer suitable for the needs of the current work. To master modern weapons, you need cultural knowledge!"

Although he had this desire, he never had the opportunity to study systematically because of the busy army work. With the arrival of the victorious situation of the national revolution, his desire to learn became even more urgent. Therefore, he felt annoyed whenever he heard others advise him to enjoy life. He felt that since he was an old Party member and a veteran cadre of the Long March, he should aspire to conquer the fortress of cultural knowledge.

**To Be a Good Hired Hand for the People**

At the end of 1950, he formally entered the Hubei Provincial Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School. On the day of the opening ceremony, Zhang Huanchao, like a newly enrolled primary school student, went to the school's barbershop for a haircut with excitement and joy, but he encountered an unpleasant thing. As soon as he sat in the barber's chair, a young barber walked over with a smile and asked curiously: "Comrade! Are you a teacher or a newly transferred section chief?"

"No! No! I'm a student," Zhang Huanchao replied quickly.

"I don't believe it! How can there be such an old student."

"Why would I lie to you? Look, aren't I wearing a student badge?" Zhang Huanchao pointed to the badge on his chest to prove it to him.

"Hey! Learning at such an old age, isn't that wasting the people's blood and sweat?"

"Young comrade, how can you say that! There is an old Chinese saying: 'Live and learn.' Someone like me can't recognize a bagful of big characters, and I can't do my job well. That's really wasting the people's blood and sweat. Learning cultural knowledge to be a better hired hand for the people, what's wrong with that!" Zhang Huanchao said righteously, leaving the other party speechless.

During the six or seven years in the Provincial Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School and Wuhan University, such things came to Zhang Huanchao one after another, each more acute than the last. To persist in learning, and to learn well, one must fight against individualistic ideas. He was not overwhelmed by the difficulties in this struggle but became stronger with each test.

Once, Comrade Zhang Huanchao was studying attentively when a classmate named Feng came over, attempting to persuade him to drop out, saying: "It's really a living hell to go to school at such an old age. Originally, you were a section chief. If you didn't study, wouldn't you be promoted in your job? Maybe you could even become a department head! If it were me, I wouldn't come here to study. I say, Lao Zhang, you are a bit of a fool!" Later, during the grading, someone said to Zhang Huanchao: "If you didn't come to study, couldn't you be promoted several grades? Now you are still wearing a yellow cloth suit; if you were in your job, couldn't you wear a woolen suit, leather shoes, and a watch?" Zhang Huanchao said humorously: "Don't we all go up a grade every year we stay in school? If you don't study hard and engage in individualism, you might get held back! I am very grateful that some people are concerned about my future. But asking the Party for a rank and treatment is not concern, but it's harming me."

**Carefully Planning Time for Diligent Study**

Because Comrade Zhang Huanchao has a tenacious heart, his purpose of learning is not to climb up the ladder for personal gain, but to work better for the Party and the people. The difficulties in learning did not scare him. The difficulties were overcome by his revolutionary enthusiasm and persevering will. When he was in the Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School, because the school had just been established, the desks and chairs were incomplete, and his waist and legs ached after studying for a long time. Writing was even more difficult, making him sweat profusely, but he still couldn't write properly. His memory was also worse than others, and he spent more time studying than others. His way to overcome these difficulties was to carefully plan and try every means to arrange time for diligent study. The specific methods were: first, not resting on holidays, staying in the room alone to bury himself in reading, supplementing notes, and writing reflections; second, making another small notebook, writing down the difficult-to-remember nouns, carrying it with him, and using the time before and after meals and when walking outside to take it out and read; third, writing the difficult-to-remember nouns, personal names, place names, and basic principles on small slips of paper, sticking them on the top and sides of the bunk bed, and using the time to sleep, get up, take off clothes, and put on clothes to recognize and read them; fourth, organizing review groups, asking each other questions, and if he couldn't answer immediately, he would think about it, and if he really couldn't think of it, he would look in the book again. For four years, Comrade Zhang Huanchao has been learning the entire junior and senior high school courses in this selfless spirit. Every semester, his language, mathematics, history, geography, algebra, social science, political class, geometry, trigonometry, physics, chemistry, had no subject that was not passed, and the history class was the best. In 1954, he graduated from middle school and was admitted to the History Department of Wuhan University in the same year.

There were more courses in university than in middle school, and there were no lecture notes, making it difficult to take notes in class. He would either focus on listening or on taking notes, but not both. His notes were incomplete; he couldn't understand classical Chinese; and his reading ability was also worse than others. Others could read a dozen pages of a book in an hour, but he could only read two or three pages. He still adopted the old method of overcoming learning difficulties, relying on his own efforts and squeezing out all the time to read reference books and supplement notes. However, the university was different from the Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School. There were many young students, and they had culture. The young students knew that Zhang Huanchao was a Long March cadre and were willing to help him with his learning difficulties, enthusiastically explaining to him. After the young students were sure that he fully understood, they would ask him to tell the story of the Long March. Therefore, Zhang Huanchao got along very well with the young students. Comrade Zhang Huanchao, due to the specific help of the young students, coupled with his careful listening, serious review, and concentration of all his energy when studying, plunged into it, and the initial difficulties were overcome, and the entire four years of university study went smoothly. During the summer vacation, he finished reading the first volume of Mao Zedong's Selected Works, selected and read the second volume and several short stories by Lu Xun, and also wrote notes on his reading experiences.

Now, Comrade Zhang Huanchao has become an excellent university student. He has finally realized his wish to conquer the fortress of cultural knowledge and is about to embark on the socialist construction post with the cultural knowledge he has mastered. On the eve of his graduation from university, university and middle school students in the Wuhan area wrote letters to him to express their congratulations. Many young students have taken Zhang Huanchao's spirit of hard study as their example and are determined to become intellectual of the working class who are both Red and expert. (Attached picture)

Zhang Huanchao is about to graduate from university. The topic of his graduation thesis is "The Military Line During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War." His teacher is a young teacher, Comrade Cao Muqing. They have not only established a close teacher-student relationship but also a cordial friendship.

    昔日的红军战士　今日的大学生
    ——记武汉大学历史系学生张焕潮的勤学苦练
    本报记者　孙祖年
    同学张焕潮，革命打前哨。
    昔日当红军，今日进大学。
    革命数十年，从不居功劳；
    要是论俭朴，他应列前茅。
    人见他有钱，劝他买手表，
    他却买个球，寄给小学校。
    学习下苦功，成绩也很好。
    态度很谦虚，人人都称道。
    响应团号召，学习张焕潮：
    一心为人民，红专定做到。
    这是武汉大学大学生黄泽佩所编的快板。这个快板概括地介绍了张焕潮艰苦朴素、刻苦学习，由红军战士、文盲变成大学生的事迹。
    农民出身的优秀的大学生
    张焕潮现在四十一岁，是武汉大学历史系四年级的学生，今年暑假就要毕业了。从大学一年级到四年级，他的学习成绩一直是很好的。历史系的整个课程门门及格，考试成绩绝大部分是四分，五分也不少。去年学年论文“第一次世界大战以后中国纺织工业的发展”，还受到教授们的赞扬。
    张焕潮不仅学习成绩好，在各种政治运动中也是积极的。他担任历史系的党总支副书记，非常重视政治思想工作。当去年右派分子向党猖狂进攻、企图夺取高等学校的领导权的时候，他勇敢地站起来，保卫党的利益，领导群众和右派分子作斗争。双反运动中，为了办好社会主义大学，培养又红又专的人才，他积极地帮助教师改进教学，他先后揭发了许多事实，并批判了教师教学中的资产阶级观点；还写了一封公开信，批判讲师石泉教学中的客观主义。
    在生活上，他住校七年多，一直保持着艰苦朴素的作风。每月四十元调干助学金，除了吃饭以外，从不乱花销，也不添置衣服，还穿着部队里的旧衣服。几年来他把积蓄下来的钱，买了篮球和书籍、文具等，送给故乡大别山区的小学。在反浪费斗争中，同学们把他的简单行装和破旧衣服，布置了一个展览会。团省委还特地组织武汉地区大学生们前往参观，号召同学们学习张焕潮同志勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的作风。
    立志攻克“文化堡垒”
    1950年张焕潮同志因为身体不好，由部队转业到地方，临行时领导上和同志们关怀地对他说：“焕潮同志，近二十年来，你经历了长征和抗日战争、解放战争中的南征北战，而且负过伤，现在身体又不太好，回到地方上以后，工作上不要太勉强，应该好好地休养”。回到久别重逢的故乡——红安县张石河村，来看望他的乡亲和朋友们，也同样以关怀的心情劝他：“现在胜利了，自从你离开家乡长征的那一年，国民党反动派烧毁了房屋，母亲死里逃生总算把你等回来了，现在她老人家年纪已经很大，你可不能再远走高飞罗！”
    “回家享福”这句话，张焕潮同志听不进去，他自己有一个攻破文化堡垒的远大理想，这个理想在他内心里已经隐藏了很久。还是在解放战争时期，那时他担任炮兵教导员，有一次下连队，炮兵们热情地请教他一些炮兵知识。张焕潮没有上过学，那懂得三角几何哩！当时一句话也说不上来，脸上火辣辣的。晚上已经是夜深了，战士们都已入睡，而张焕潮翻来复去地睡不着，战士们向他提出的问题，还在他脑子里盘旋着。心想：“我闭着眼睛也能把拆下的步枪、手枪装起来，也指挥部队打过仗，可是，这些经验已经不能适应当前工作需要了。要掌握现代化武器，就要有文化知识啊！”
    虽然他有这个要求，但是，因为军队工作十分繁忙，一直没有机会有系统地学习。随着全国革命胜利形势的到来，他的渴望学习的心更切了。因此，他一听到别人劝他享福，心里就厌烦。他觉得自己既是老党员，长征老干部，就应当立志攻下文化知识堡垒。
    为了给人民当好长工
    1950年年底，他正式进入湖北省工农速成中学。开学典礼的那一天，张焕潮像一个刚入学的小学生一样，兴奋而愉快地到学校理发室理发，但碰到一件不愉快的事情。他刚坐在理发椅上，一位青年理发员笑嘻嘻地走过来，好奇地问道：“同志！你是教员还是新调来的科长？”
    “不！不！我是学生”张焕潮急促的回答。
    “我才不信哩！那有这大年纪的学生”。
    “这有什么好骗你的哩，你看，我这不是挂的学生证章吗”。张焕潮指着胸前的牌牌向他证明。
    “嘿！这大年纪还学习，不是糟蹋人民的血汗吗？”
    “你这同志年青青地，怎么能这样说话呀！中国有一句古话：做到老学到老。像我这样的人斗大的字认不到一麻袋，工作做不好，那才真是糟蹋人民的血汗呢。学习了文化知识，更好地为人民当好长工，这有什么不好呢！”张焕潮理直气壮说得对方哑口无言。
    在省工农速成中学以及在武汉大学的六、七年间，这种事情接二连三一个比一个更尖锐地向张焕潮袭来。要坚持学习，还要学习好，就要和个人主义思想进行斗争。在这场斗争中，他没有被难倒，而是越考验越坚强。
    有一次，张焕潮同志正在用心读书，一位姓冯的同学走过来，企图拉他闹退学，说：“这大年纪进学校学习真是活受罪，原来你是科长，如果不学习，在工作岗位上，不就可以提拔了吗，说不定还可以当处长哩！要是我呀，才不来这里学习，我说老张呀！你有一点傻啊！”后来评级的时候，又有人向张焕潮说：“你不来学习，不是能提拔好几级，现在你还不是穿着黄布衣；如果在工作岗位上，不也可以穿上了呢子衣、皮鞋，带上了手表了吗。”张焕潮幽默地说：“我们住校不是每年都升一级吗？不好好地学习，闹个人主义，那很可能留级啊！有人关心我的前途，我很感激。但要我向党要求级别待遇，这不是关心，而是害了我。”
    精打细算安排时间勤学苦练
    由于张焕潮同志有一颗顽强的心，他学习的目的，不是为了个人往上爬，而是为党为人民更好地工作。学习上的困难并没有吓倒他。困难都被他那革命的干劲、刻苦顽强的意志克服了。在工农速成中学的时候，因为学校刚开始创办，桌椅不全，学习久了，腰痛腿酸。写字更困难，急得满头汗，还写不成样子。记忆力也比别人差，学习比别人花的时间多。进入高中后，代数很难记，还要做党支部的工作。他克服这些困难的办法是，精打细算，千方百计安排时间，进行勤学苦练。具体办法是：一，假日不休息，一人在房里埋头读书补笔记写体会；二，另做一个小本子，把难记的名词记在上面，随身携带，利用饭前饭后外出走路的时间拿出来念；三，把不好记的名词、人名、地名、基本原理，写在小纸条上，贴在双层床的床顶上、床旁边，利用睡觉、起床脱衣、穿衣的时间认和念；四，组织复习小组，互相提问，马上答不上来，就想一想，真正想不出来再翻书看。四年来，张焕潮同志就是这样以忘我的精神学完了全部初中高中课程。每一个学期，他的语文、数学、历史、地理、代数、社会科学、政治课、几何、三角、物理、化学，没有一门不及格的，历史课考的最好。1954年中学毕业，当年就考上了武汉大学历史系。
    大学的课程比中学多，又没有讲义，课堂上记笔记很困难，顾上了听就顾不上记，顾上记就顾不上听，笔记记的丢三落四的；听不懂古文；阅读能力也比别人差，别人一小时看十几页书，他才看两三页。他还是采取过去克服学习困难的老办法，靠自己努力，挤出一切时间看参考书补笔记。不过大学和工农速成中学不同，青年学生多，他们有文化。青年学生们知道张焕潮是长征干部，对他的学习上的困难，都乐意帮助他，热情地为他讲解。青年学生们等他完全懂了以后，就要求他讲长征故事。因此，张焕潮和青年学生们搞的很融洽。张焕潮同志由于得到了青年学生的具体帮助，加上自己认真听课、认真复习，学习时集中一切精力，一头钻进去，开始时的那些困难都被战胜了，整个大学四年的学习都很顺利。在暑假中，他读完了毛泽东选集第一卷，选读了第二卷和几本鲁迅短篇小说，还写出了读书体会的笔记。
    现在，张焕潮同志已成为一个优秀的大学生，他终于实现了攻克文化知识堡垒的愿望，即将带着已经掌握的文化知识，踏上社会主义建设岗位。在他即将大学毕业的前夕，武汉地区大、中学生，纷纷给他写信表示祝贺。很多青年学生们，把张焕潮的苦学精神作为自己的榜样，立志做一个又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。（附图片）
    张焕潮大学快毕业了。他作的毕业论文题目“第二次国内革命战争时期的军事路线问题”，指导他的老师是一位青年教师曹木清同志。他们不仅建立亲密的师生关系，而且也建立了亲切的朋友关系。这是曹老师（左）在指导张焕潮作毕业论文。　　　刘文华摄
