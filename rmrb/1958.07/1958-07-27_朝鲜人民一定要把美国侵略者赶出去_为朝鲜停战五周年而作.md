The Korean People Must Drive Out the American Aggressors
——Written on the Fifth Anniversary of the Korean Armistice
General Kim Kwang-hyop, Minister of National Defense of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

Today, the Korean people and officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, welcome the fifth anniversary of the victory of the great Fatherland Liberation War, in an environment where socialist construction in the northern part of the Republic has entered a high tide.

Five years ago today, the American imperialists suffered a shameful defeat in the war of aggression against the Korean people and knelt before the Korean people.

The Korean War was a large-scale, planned and prepared armed aggression by American imperialism after World War II.

The enemy ignited the flames of aggression in Korea, attempting to turn the Korean people into slaves of its colony forever, to strangle the Korean revolution, and then to use Korea as a springboard to attack the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, launch a new world war, and vainly attempt to dominate the world. Therefore, the Korean War was a just liberation struggle of the Korean people against the savage armed aggression of American imperialists, to defend the freedom and independence of their country and the fruits of their revolution; at the same time, it was an acute struggle between socialism and imperialism, between the forces of peace and the forces of war.

In order to achieve its aggressive goals, American imperialism invested huge amounts of troops and materials in the Korean War, and frantically destroyed Korean cities and villages and massacred peaceful residents with unparalleled brutality and cruelty in human history. It even brutally violated international conventions and unscrupulously used bacteriological and chemical weapons.

However, it was not the Korean people who were subdued, but the American aggressors themselves.

Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean people and officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, who rose up to wage a just struggle, together with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, inflicted heavy casualties and material losses on the imperialist armed aggressors headed by American imperialism, disrupted the Pentagon's adventurous strategic plans, and completely shattered the American myth of "strength" and "technical omnipotence."

The American invading army suffered not only a military but also an irreparable moral defeat in the Korean War, which is a severe historical lesson for the aggressors.

The great victory won by the Korean people in the Patriotic War demonstrates the superiority of the democratic system established in the northern part of the Republic under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party after liberation and its infinite vitality.

The heroic struggle of the Korean people proves that the power of the people who hold sovereignty in their own hands, unite and fight for the freedom and independence of their country under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party cannot be conquered by any force.

The historic victory of the Korean people clearly demonstrates the invincible power of proletarian internationalism.

The Korean people's just struggle against the enemy was warmly supported by the people of the powerful socialist camp countries headed by the great Soviet Union and by peace-loving people all over the world, which gave the Korean people and the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army great encouragement in the arduous war.

In particular, the fraternal Chinese people sent their outstanding sons and daughters to form the Volunteers and aided the Korean people with their blood. The Chinese People's Volunteers shared life and death with our People's Army in the Korean War, sharing weal and woe, and displayed incomparable heroism, becoming a vivid example of proletarian internationalism.

Five years have passed since the Korean armistice. During this period, the situation in Korea has become even more favorable to the Korean people fighting for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Along with the unprecedented upsurge in socialist construction in the northern part of the Republic, the revolutionary forces of the Korean people have been further strengthened.

Thanks to the correct economic policy of the Korean Workers' Party, which gives priority to the development of heavy industry while developing light industry and agriculture, and thanks to the selfless labor of the entire working people, headed by the working class and the peasants, to realize this correct economic policy, in a short period of time, not only were the wounds of the cruel war healed, but all parts of the people's economy significantly surpassed the pre-war level, thus basically laying the foundation for economic independence. Korean industry already has a strong heavy and light industrial base capable of supplying the power, materials, equipment, and necessities for the construction of socialism and the people's livelihood. The total industrial output value in 1957 has increased to 2.8 times that of 1949.

The Korean countryside, which used to be in a backward small-scale peasant economy, has now become an advanced socialist countryside with more than 98.6% of farmers cooperativized; agricultural production is developing rapidly on a new technical and economic basis.

Cities and villages such as Pyongyang, which had been turned into ruins, have been restored and are presenting a new look. The people's lives, which had suffered from the cruel war, have been significantly improved.

Today, a large-scale socialist cultural revolution is underway in the northern half of the Republic, and preparations for the implementation of the compulsory secondary education system are also progressing smoothly. The implementation of compulsory secondary education is still a pioneering undertaking in Asia.

All this proves that an unprecedented revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic has arrived. The Korean people are riding the Chollima towards the peak of socialism.

During the first five-year plan period, Korea's total industrial output value can increase to more than 2.6 times, and agricultural production can also increase to 2 times. The socialist economic base will be further consolidated. The Republic will become an independent industrial-agricultural country.

All these brilliant achievements and accomplishments made by the Korean people in just five years after the war completely shattered the American imperialists' delusion that the Korean people would never be able to stand up again due to the cruel war damage, and demonstrated how great miracles the people who hold sovereignty in their own hands can create by giving play to their creativity and initiative.

The great creative efforts made by the working people in the northern half of the Republic in peaceful construction prove that the Korean people do not want war but desire peace and prosperity, which is a powerful manifestation of our people's unanimous desire for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

The Korean Workers' Party and the Government of the Republic have continued to make sincere efforts for peace and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland after the war.

The Korean-Chinese side strictly abided by the Armistice Agreement and made every persistent effort to consolidate the Korean Armistice. In order to promote a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, the Korean Workers' Party and the Government of the Republic have repeatedly put forward a series of reasonable plans and practical countermeasures, and in 1956, reduced 80,000 military personnel and corresponding military equipment from the Korean People's Army.

The Government of the Republic issued a statement on February 5 this year, suggesting that all foreign troops withdraw from North and South Korea to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea. This statement is of particular significance.

According to the talks between the delegation of the Governments of Korea and China, the Chinese People's Volunteers have taken the initiative to decide to withdraw all troops from Korea by the end of this year. The first batch of troop withdrawals has ended, and the second batch of troop withdrawals is in progress. This has opened a new situation for easing the tension in Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean issue, which is greatly beneficial to peace in the Far East and the world.

A peaceful solution to the Korean issue is already a mature issue and cannot be delayed any longer. However, the American aggressive clique is doing everything possible to obstruct a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and is attempting to continue to occupy South Korea for a long time.

The American imperialists, who do not want the peaceful reunification of Korea, have systematically violated the Armistice Agreement after the war, and continue to increase military strength in South Korea. Recently, they have more blatantly carried out atomic war preparations and frequently created provocative military harassment activities.

While the Korean people and the people of the world strongly demand that the American invading army immediately withdraw from South Korea, they not only refuse to withdraw their troops from South Korea, but further increase their military strength, illegally transport various new types of weapons such as 280 mm atomic cannons and "Honest John" rockets into South Korea, and formally established the so-called "Fourth Missile Command" near Chuncheon, not far from the military demarcation line on July 4, entering the stage of establishing missile bases aimed at mass slaughter of residents. This is not only another blatant violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, but also a malicious provocative act that hinders the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and seriously threatens peace in Korea and the Far East.

The provocative acts committed by the American imperialists in South Korea today are a link in their chain of creating a comprehensive war in all parts of the world.

Recently, the American and British imperialists carried out sinful armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, once again exposing their ferocious faces as enemies of peace in front of the people of the world.

The armed aggression of the American and British ruling groups against the Arab people has sharpened the situation in the Middle East and seriously threatens world peace.

However, the adventurous actions of the imperialist aggressors against the Arab people who are rising up for freedom and national independence will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat. Just as the historical lessons of the Korean War clearly show.

The Korean people, together with the peace-loving people all over the world, firmly protest and condemn the armed aggression of the American and British imperialists against the Arab people, and fully support and support the Arab people's struggle for the freedom and national independence of their motherland, and believe that the final victory will belong to the Arab people.

For thirteen years, due to the American imperialists' implementation of a colonial enslavement policy in South Korea, South Korea's national industry has almost completely gone bankrupt, and the rural economy has fallen into ruin.

Today in South Korea, 3.8 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people wander the streets, and terrible hunger will sweep across the entire South Korea. The American invading army runs rampant in South Korea, arbitrarily carrying out massacres, robberies, arson and other atrocities against innocent people.

South Korea under the occupation of the American invading army has become a hell on earth.

All this fully illustrates that the root cause of all the misfortunes and sufferings experienced by the South Korean people lies in the occupation of South Korea by the American invading army and in the aggressive policy pursued by the United States in Korea; otherwise, Korea would have been peacefully reunified long ago, and the South Korean people would have eliminated exploitation and oppression and built a socialist paradise like the North Korean people.

Precisely for this reason, South Korean workers, peasants and other patriotic people, inspired by the soaring achievements of socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic, have more extensively plunged into the anti-American and anti-Syngman Rhee struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

American imperialism cannot legitimize the adventurous provocative acts of the American aggressive troops occupying South Korea and establishing missile bases with any excuse.

If they want to use atomic bombs and missiles to frustrate the Korean people's will to peacefully reunify their motherland in order to save their deep crisis of colonial rule in South Korea, then they are greatly mistaken. They will never be able to overwhelm the Korean people.

If the American aggressors do not withdraw their troops from South Korea and continue to carry out aggressive actions, they will be subject to even more severe condemnation from the people of the world and will suffer serious consequences.

The American aggressors must never forget the historical lessons of the shameful defeat they suffered at the hands of the Korean people five years ago.

Our country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which defeated the American aggressors five years ago, is even more powerful today. The revolutionary democratic base in the northern part of the Republic has been further consolidated in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. The revolutionary forces of the Korean people are growing stronger and stronger.

The Korean People's Army stands guard vigilantly on the front lines, maintaining peace in Korea, defending the revolutionary democratic base in northern Korea and the socialist victory fruits of the people, and is developing into an invincible army.

Today, the development of the international situation is definitely beneficial to the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. Socialism has achieved a decisive victory in the world, and the belief in peace has taken deep root in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. The socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union is stronger than the imperialist group in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and science, and has all the necessary strength and means to prevent war.

Today, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, are confidently advancing towards the peaceful reunification of their motherland and the socialist construction of the northern part of the Republic. No force can stop this magnificent advance of the Korean people.

The Korean people, who are firmly united around the Korean Workers' Party and the Government of the Republic headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung, will surely drive the American aggressors out of Korea and realize the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    朝鲜人民一定要把美国侵略者赶出去
    ——为朝鲜停战五周年而作
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国民族保卫相　金光侠大将
    今天，朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军官兵，在朝鲜劳动党领导下，在共和国北部社会主义建设进入高潮的环境里，迎接伟大的祖国解放战争胜利五周年。
    在五年前的今天，美帝国主义者在反对朝鲜人民的侵略战争中遭到了可耻失败，屈膝于朝鲜人民面前。
    朝鲜战争是二次大战后美帝国主义有计划有准备的大规模武装侵略。
    敌人在朝鲜燃起侵略的战火，企图把朝鲜人民永远变为它的殖民地的奴隶，绞杀朝鲜的革命，进而以朝鲜为跳板来进攻苏联和中华人民共和国，发动新的世界战争，并妄想独霸世界。因此，朝鲜战争是朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义者野蛮的武装侵略，保卫自己祖国的自由、独立和自己革命果实的正义的解放斗争；同时又是社会主义和帝国主义之间，和平力量和战争势力之间的一场激烈的斗争。
    为了达到它的侵略目的，美帝国主义者在朝鲜战争中投入了庞大的兵力和物力，并以人类历史上无与伦比的兽性和残忍性疯狂地破坏朝鲜的城市和乡村，残杀和平居民。甚至粗暴地破坏国际公约，肆无忌惮地使用细菌武器和化学武器。
    但是，被屈服的不是朝鲜人民，而正是美国侵略者自己。
    在朝鲜劳动党的领导下奋起进行正义斗争的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军官兵，同兄弟的中国人民志愿军一起，使以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义武装侵略者遭受到沉重的兵员损失和物资损失，打乱了五角大楼冒险的战略计划，从而彻底粉碎了美国的所谓“强大”和“技术万能”的神话。
    美国侵略军在朝鲜战争中不仅在军事上，而且在道义上遭受了不可挽回的惨败，这对侵略者来说是一个严峻的历史教训。
    朝鲜人民在卫国战争中所争取的伟大胜利，显示了解放后在朝鲜劳动党领导下，在共和国北部建立的民主制度的优越性及其无穷无尽的生命力。
    朝鲜人民的英雄斗争证明：在马克思列宁主义党的领导下，把主权掌握在自己手中、团结起来为祖国的自由和独立而战的人民的力量是任何力量也不能征服的。
    朝鲜人民的历史性胜利，清楚地显示了无产阶级国际主义战无不胜的威力。
    朝鲜人民反对敌人的正义斗争，是得到以伟大苏联为首的强有力的社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支援，这在艰苦的战争中给予朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军官兵以巨大的鼓舞。
    特别是兄弟的中国人民以自己优秀的儿女组成志愿军，以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战争中同我们人民军一起同生死、共甘苦，发挥了无比的英勇精神而成为无产阶级国际主义的生动的榜样。
    从朝鲜停战那时起，已经经过了五年。在这期间，朝鲜的局势转变得对为和平统一祖国而斗争的朝鲜人民更加有利。
    在共和国北部社会主义建设的空前高涨的同时，朝鲜人民的革命力量也进一步地加强了。
    由于朝鲜劳动党实行了优先发展重工业，同时发展轻工业和农业的正确的经济政策，又由于以工人阶级和农民为首的全体劳动人民为实现这个正确的经济政策而进行了忘我的劳动，在短短的期间内，不仅医治了残酷的战争创伤，而且使人民经济所有部分显著地超越了战前水平，因而基本上奠定了经济独立的基础。朝鲜的工业已经有了坚强的重工业和轻工业基地，能够供应建设社会主义所需要的动力、资材、设备和人民生活必需品。工业总产值在1957年已增加到1949年的二点八倍。
    过去处在落后的小农经济状况下的朝鲜农村，今天已变成为有98.6％以上的农户合作化了的先进的社会主义农村；农业生产在新的技术和经济基础上迅速地发展着。
    曾经变为废墟的平壤等各城市和乡村已经恢复起来，呈现出新的面貌。曾经遭受残酷的战争摧残的人民生活有了显著的改善。
    今天，共和国北半部的大规模的社会主义文化革命正在进行，为实行中等义务教育制的准备工作也正顺利地进行着。中等义务教育的实行在亚洲来说还是创举。
    这一切证明，共和国北半部社会主义建设的空前的革命高潮已经到来。朝鲜人民正跨上千里马向着社会主义高峰前进。
    在第一个五年计划期间，朝鲜的工业总产值可以增长到二点六倍以上，农业生产也可以增加到二倍。社会主义的经济基础进一步得到巩固。共和国将变成为自主的工业—农业国家。
    朝鲜人民在战后不过五年的期间所取得的这一切光辉的成就和业绩，完全粉碎了美帝国主义者认为朝鲜人民由于残酷的战争破坏再也站不起来的妄想，并且显示了把主权掌握在自己手中的人民发挥创造性和积极性，能够创造出多么伟大的奇迹。
    共和国北半部劳动人民在和平建设中所进行的巨大的创造性的努力，证明朝鲜人民不愿意战争，而愿望和平和繁荣，这就是我们人民一致向往祖国的和平统一的强有力的表现。
    朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府为了和平，为了祖国的和平统一，在战后继续作了真诚的努力。
    朝中方面严格地遵守停战协定，为了巩固朝鲜停战，作了一切坚忍的努力。朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府为了促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，
  多次提出了一系列的合理方案和切实的对策，并在1956年从朝鲜人民军中裁减了八万名军事人员和相应的军事装备。
    共和国政府在今年2月5日发表声明，建议一切外国军队撤出南北朝鲜，以促进朝鲜的和平统一。这一声明具有特别重大的意义。
    根据朝中两国政府代表团的会谈，中国人民志愿军采取主动措施，决定到今年年底为止全部撤出朝鲜，首批撤军已经结束，第二批撤军工作正在进行。这为缓和朝鲜的紧张局势和朝鲜问题的和平解决开打了新的局面，大大有利于远东和世界和平。
    朝鲜问题的和平解决已经是成熟了的问题，不容再迟缓了。但是，美国侵略集团百般阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，企图继续长期强占南朝鲜。
    不愿意朝鲜和平统一的美帝国主义者在战后有系统地破坏停战协定，在南朝鲜继续增强军事力量，最近更加露骨地进行原子战争准备，频繁制造挑衅性的军事骚扰活动。
    当朝鲜人民和全世界人民强硬要求美国侵略军立即撤出南朝鲜的时候，他们不仅不愿意从南朝鲜撤出自己的军队，却进一步增强军事力量，向南朝鲜非法运入二百八十公厘原子炮和“诚实的约翰”式火箭等各种新型武器，7月4日在离军事分界线不远的春川附近，正式成立所谓“第四导弹司令部”，进入了建立目的在于大量屠杀居民的导弹基地的阶段。这不仅又一次粗暴地违反了朝鲜停战协定，而且是阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决和严重地威胁朝鲜和远东和平的恶毒的挑衅行为。
    美帝国主义者今天在南朝鲜制造的挑衅行为，就是他们在世界各处制造全面战争的一个环节。
    最近，美英帝国主义者对黎巴嫩和约旦进行罪恶的武装侵略，在世界人民面前再一次暴露了它们的和平敌人的
  凶恶面孔。
    美英统治集团对阿拉伯人民的武装侵略，使中近东地区的形势尖锐化，严重地威胁着世界和平。
    但是，帝国主义侵略者反对为自由和民族独立而奋起的阿拉伯人民的冒险行为，将不可避免地要遭到可耻的失败。正像朝鲜战争的历史教训所清楚显示的一样。
    朝鲜人民同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，坚决抗议和谴责美英帝国主义者对阿拉伯人民的武装侵略，并全面支持和声援阿拉伯人民争取自己祖国的自由和民族独立的斗争，确信最后胜利将属于阿拉伯人民。
    十三年来，由于美帝国主义者在南朝鲜实行殖民地奴役政策，南朝鲜的民族工业几乎全部遭到破产，农村经济陷于荒废。
    今天在南朝鲜，有三百八十万名失业者和半失业者彷徨于街头巷尾，可怕的饥饿将席卷整个南朝鲜。美国侵略军在南朝鲜横行霸道，任意对无辜的人民进行屠杀、抢劫、放火等暴行。
    美国侵略军强占下的南朝鲜变成了人间地狱。
    这一切完全说明：南朝鲜人民经受的一切不幸和痛苦的根源就在于美国侵略军的强占南朝鲜，就在于美国在朝鲜执行的侵略政策；否则，朝鲜早已和平统一了，南朝鲜人民也像北朝鲜人民一样，肃清剥削和压迫，建设社会主义的乐园了。
    正因为这样，南朝鲜工人、农民等爱国人民，在共和国北半部的飞跃发展的社会主义建设成就的鼓舞下，为祖国的和平统一，更广泛地投入到反美反李承晚的斗争中去。
    美帝国主义用任何借口也不可能把美国侵略军队强占南朝鲜、建立导弹基地等冒险性的挑衅行为加以合法化。
    他们如果想用原子弹和导弹来挫折朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的斗志，以挽救他们在南朝鲜殖民地统治的深刻危机，那么，他们就大错特错了。他们是决不可能压倒朝鲜人民的。
    美国侵略者如不从南朝鲜撤出他们的军队，还要继续进行侵略行动的话，那么，他们将受到全世界人民更加严厉的谴责，并将遭受严重的后果。
    美国侵略者决不应当忘记，五年前它在朝鲜人民面前得到的可耻惨败的历史教训。
    五年前击溃美国侵略者的我们祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的威力今天更加强大了。共和国北部革命民主基地在政治、经济、文化等各方面更加巩固了。朝鲜人民的革命力量，日益加强和壮大。
    朝鲜人民军警惕地站在前哨阵地上，维护朝鲜的和平，保卫朝鲜北部的革命民主基地和人民的社会主义的胜利果实，并且正发展成为一支战无不胜的军队。
    今天，国际局势的发展肯定地有利于朝鲜人民为祖国的和平统一的斗争。社会主义在世界上取得了决定性的胜利，和平的信念在亿万人民的心中深深地扎下了根。以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营在政治、经济、文化和科学等一切方面都比帝国主义集团强大，并且具有防止战争的一切必要的力量和手段。
    今天，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，满怀信心地为祖国的和平统一和共和国北部的社会主义建设大步前进。任何力量也不可能阻挡朝鲜人民的这一雄壮的前进。
    坚强地团结在以金日成元帅为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府周围的朝鲜人民，一定要把美国侵略者赶出朝鲜去，实现祖国和平统一的伟大事业。
