Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch. The head of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee issued a statement today, warmly congratulating the great victory of the Iraqi people and sternly condemning the U.S. imperialist armed intervention in Lebanon. He pointed out that the Chinese people will resolutely support the Iraqi people and the Lebanese people who are fighting for independence and freedom.

The head of the Committee said: "The birth of the Republic of Iraq not only means that Asia has one more country that has broken away from imperialist control and achieved national independence, but also marks the upsurge and new victory of the Arab people's struggle for independence, the national liberation struggle in Asia and Africa, and the liberation struggle of all oppressed nations in the world. This is undoubtedly another great encouragement to the people of the world in their struggle for peace and against a new war. We warmly congratulate the Iraqi people on this great victory!"

He said: "Obviously, imperialism will not be reconciled to this. Now, the troops of the American aggressors have landed in Lebanon and begun direct armed intervention, and are also threatening to carry out armed intervention against the Iraqi people. But the era when aggressors relied on strong ships and cannons to conquer a nation is long gone. The U.S. imperialism's intervention in Lebanon and the entire Middle East can only arouse wider and more resolute resistance from the people of the Middle East, and arouse condemnation and counterattacks from people all over the world who love justice and peace. We believe that the awakened Arab people, with the sympathy and support of the people of the world, will surely be able to defeat the imperialist conspiracy of aggression and armed intervention. Our people will stand firmly with the people of Arab countries, together with the broad masses of people in Asian and African countries, and with the broad masses of people in socialist countries, to resolutely support the Iraqi people and the Lebanese people who are fighting for independence and freedom. The armed intervention and aggression launched by imperialism against the people of the Middle East will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat like the Suez Canal incident, and the result can only accelerate the collapse and demise of the imperialist camp."

Dapu Sheng, Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Association, and Yang Jingren, Vice President of the China-Arab United Republic Friendship Association, also issued statements today, hailing the victory of the Iraqi people. Dapu Sheng said: "The great victory of the Iraqi people shattered the Eisenhower Doctrine, disintegrated the axis of the Baghdad Pact of U.S. imperialist aggression in the Middle East, aided the struggle of the Lebanese people, and fundamentally changed the situation in the Middle East. The era in which imperialism contentedly enslaved oppressed nations is gone forever."

Dapu Sheng sternly condemned U.S. imperialism's attempt to carry out armed intervention in Iraq. He said: "If imperialism dares to launch a new adventure, it will inevitably suffer a more shameful defeat than it suffered in Egypt and Syria. We Chinese Muslims, together with all the Chinese people, resolutely stand on the side of the Iraqi people, resolutely support the just struggle of the Iraqi people, and resolutely oppose any imperialist intervention in Iraq.

"The Iraqi people, the Arab people, and the struggle of all oppressed nations against imperialism and for independence will surely be victorious! Any conspiracy of imperialist intervention will surely fail!"

Yang Jingren, Vice President of the China-Arab Friendship Association, said that when the good news of the Iraqi people overthrowing the Faisal dynasty came, "the Chinese people were as jubilant as if it were their own victory. The Chinese people have long suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression, and now U.S. imperialism is still occupying our Taiwan, so our people feel particularly brotherly sympathy for the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people. We warmly congratulate the birth of the Republic of Iraq, and warmly congratulate the great victory of the Iraqi people!"

Yang Jingren said: "The wolfish imperialists not only have not learned the necessary lessons from the victory of the Arab people, but have instead sent invading troops to land in Lebanon, and are still threatening to carry out armed intervention against the Iraqi people. But armed intervention cannot scare people, and its end can only be the shameful defeat of imperialist forces and the glorious victory of the people of all countries striving for independence.

"Let the raging fire of national liberation in the Middle East burn down the clutches of imperialist interventionists! Victory belongs to the Iraqi and Lebanese people!"

    亚非民族解放斗争获新胜利
    巴格达条约的轴心已经瓦解
    中国亚非团结委员会等团体贺伊拉克共和国诞生
    新华社16日讯　中国亚非团结委员会负责人今天发表谈话热烈祝贺伊拉克人民的伟大胜利，并且严正谴责美帝国主义对黎巴嫩的武装干涉。他指出，中国人民将坚决支持为独立自由而战的伊拉克人民和黎巴嫩人民。
    这位负责人说：“伊拉克共和国的诞生，不但意味着亚洲又多了一个摆脱帝国主义控制、取得民族独立的国家，而且标志着阿拉伯人民的独立斗争、亚非两洲的民族解放斗争和全世界所有被压迫民族的解放斗争的高涨和新的胜利。这对全世界人民争取和平、反对新战争的斗争，毫无疑义地又是一个极大的鼓舞。我们热烈地祝贺伊拉克人民这一伟大胜利！”
    他说：“显然帝国主义是不会就此甘心的。现在，美国侵略者的军队已经在黎巴嫩登陆，开始了直接的武装干涉，而且还威胁着要对伊拉克人民进行武装干涉。但是侵略者依靠坚船利炮征服一个民族的时代早已过去了。美帝国主义对于黎巴嫩和整个中东的干涉，只能激起中东人民更加广泛和坚决的反抗，激起全世界爱好正义与和平的人民的谴责和回击。我们相信，觉醒了的阿拉伯人民在全世界人民的同情和支援下，一定能够战胜帝国主义的侵略阴谋和武装干涉。我国人民将与阿拉伯各国人民一起，同亚非各国的广大人民一起，同社会主义各国广大的人民一起，坚决支持为独立自由而战的伊拉克人民和黎巴嫩人民。帝国主义向中东人民发动的武装干涉和侵略，必然会遭到像苏伊士运河事件一样可耻的失败，其结果只能加速帝国主义阵营的崩溃和灭亡。”
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生和中国阿拉伯联合共和国友好协会副会长杨静仁今天也发表谈话，欢呼伊拉克人民的胜利。达浦生说：“伊拉克人民的伟大胜利，打烂了艾森豪威尔主义，瓦解了美帝国主义侵略中东的巴格达条约的轴心，援助了黎巴嫩人民的斗争，根本改变了中东的形势，帝国主义称心奴役被压迫民族的时代已经一去不复返了。”
    达浦生严厉地谴责美帝国主义企图对伊拉克进行武装干涉。他说：“帝国主义如果胆敢发动新的冒险，必将遭到比在埃及和叙利亚所遭受过的更可耻的失败。我们中国穆斯林和全中国人民一起，坚决站在伊拉克人民的一边，坚决支持伊拉克人民的正义斗争，坚决反对帝国主义对伊拉克的任何干涉。
    “伊拉克人民、阿拉伯人民以及一切被压迫民族反对帝国主义争取独立的斗争一定胜利！帝国主义的任何阴谋干涉，一定失败！”
    中阿友好协会副会长杨静仁说，当伊拉克人民推翻费萨尔王朝的喜讯传来的时候，“中国人民就像对待自己的胜利那样的欢欣鼓舞。中国人民曾经长期受过帝国主义的侵略和压迫，并且现在美帝国主义还霸占着我国的台湾，因而我国人民对于伊拉克人民的英勇斗争，格外感到兄弟般的同情。我们热烈祝贺伊拉克共和国的诞生，热烈祝贺伊拉克人民的伟大胜利！”
    杨静仁说：“豺狼成性的帝国主义者，不仅没有从阿拉伯人民的胜利中得到必要的教训，反而派遣侵略军队在黎巴嫩登陆，还威胁着要对伊拉克人民进行武装干涉。但是武装干涉是吓不倒人的，其结局只能是帝国主义势力可耻的失败和争取独立各国人民的光荣的胜利。
    “让中东民族解放的熊熊怒火烧毁帝国主义干涉者的魔掌！胜利属于伊拉克和黎巴嫩人民！”
