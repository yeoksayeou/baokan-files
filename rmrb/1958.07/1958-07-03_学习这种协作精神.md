    Learning This Spirit of Collaboration

    During the busy season of summer harvesting and planting, the Yuxian Flour Mill took on the task of processing flour for the agricultural cooperatives in order to ensure that all of the agricultural cooperative's manpower and animal power could be put into production. One day, the flour mill's electric motor and refrigerator suddenly broke down, and the local iron factory was unable to repair them. Transporting them to another location for repair would take a long time. Now, it was the tense moment for farmers' summer harvesting and planting, and the demand for flour increased. If manpower and animal power were used to grind flour, it would not only fail to meet the demand, but also the difficulty of lacking manpower and animal power would be impossible to solve.

    After the responsible comrades of the Central-South 126 Exploration Team stationed in Yuxian County learned about this, they mobilized the comrades in the team to assist in repairing the flour mill. With their help, the comrades in the repair shop repaired the flour mill and put it back into operation in just over two days.

    The socialist spirit of collaboration of the 126 Team comrades moved all the staff of the flour mill and grain purchasing and sales station. The flour mill's staff actively worked hard in production, increasing the daily output from 45,000 jin to 60,000 jin.

    学习这种协作精神
    在繁忙的夏收、夏种季节里，为了使农业社的人力畜力全部投入生产，禹县面粉厂担负了给农业社加工面粉的任务。一天，忽然磨粉机的电动机和冰箱坏了，当地铁工厂又不能修理，运到外地去修理需要很长时间。现在，正是农民夏收、夏种的紧张关头，面粉的需要量增大，如果用人力和畜力磨粉，不仅不能满足需要，而且缺乏人力和畜力的困难也无法解决。
    驻在禹县的中南126勘探队的负责同志知道这件事以后，就动员队里的同志来协助修理磨粉机，在他们的帮助下，修配车间的同志仅以两天多的时间就把磨粉机修理好又重新转动起来了。
    126队同志们的社会主义协作精神，感动了面粉厂和粮食购销站的全体职工。粉厂的职工积极努力生产，由日产四万五千斤提高到六万斤。
