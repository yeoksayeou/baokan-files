    Educate the People to Maintain Vigilance Constantly
    I work in public security, and I feel that the People's Daily does not report enough on public security work. I hope to often see from the newspaper how public security personnel work hard to protect our socialist construction cause. I hope the newspaper will appropriately expose the criminal activities of American-Chiang Kai-shek spies and the remaining counter-revolutionary elements who are determined to be enemies of the people, in order to educate the people to constantly maintain vigilance. I hope the newspaper will report on exemplary cases of how public security organs rely on the masses and follow the mass line.

    教育人民经常保持警惕
    我是做公安工作的，我觉得人民日报对公安工作报道的较少。希望能够时常从报纸上看到公安人员怎样为保卫我们的社会主义建设事业努力工作。希望报纸适当地揭露美蒋特务分子以及残余的、坚决与人民为敌的反革命分子阴谋破坏的罪恶活动，以教育人民经常保持警惕。希望报纸报道公安机关如何依靠群众、走群众路线的模范事例。
