Logic includes formal logic and dialectical logic. Formal logic is elementary logic, and dialectical logic is advanced logic. Formal logic is also known as logic, or ordinary logic.

I. What is Formal Logic

Formal logic is an ancient, elementary science of thinking. It studies four elementary laws of thinking (the law of identity, the law of contradiction, the law of excluded middle, and the law of sufficient reason), three forms of thinking (concept, judgment, and reasoning), and proof.

Let's first talk about forms of thinking. Thinking has content and form. The form of thinking refers to the commonalities and structure of the content of thinking. For example, with the judgments "Formal logic is useful" and "Marxism is science," their content is different, but their common form is: A is B.

Formal logic, from a relatively static point of view, combined with words (such as "is," "is not," "some," "all," "if...then..." etc.), studies the characteristics, types, rules, and functions of the three forms of thinking: concept, judgment, and reasoning.

From the perspective of formal logic, a concept is a reflection of the essential attributes of things. For example, the concept of "parallelogram" reflects the essential attribute of a parallelogram - "a quadrilateral with two pairs of opposite sides parallel." Concepts have different types, such as universal concepts and singular concepts. "Human" is a universal concept, and "Lu Xun" is a singular concept.

Concepts are expressed by words. The relationship between concept and word is the relationship between content and form. A concept cannot exist without a word.

A judgment is formed by a concept and a linking word "is" or "is not." For example, the judgment "Marxism is science" is formed by the two concepts "Marxism" and "science" and the linking word "is." The judgment "Revisionism is not Marxism" is formed by the two concepts "Revisionism" and "Marxism" and the linking word "is not."

Judgments also have different types, such as categorical judgments (see examples above), hypothetical judgments, and disjunctive judgments. "If technological reforms are carried out, then productivity will increase rapidly" is a hypothetical judgment. The form of a hypothetical judgment is: If A is B, then C is D. "War is either just or unjust" is a disjunctive judgment. The form of a disjunctive judgment is: A is either B or C.

People use judgments to think and elaborate on things. Judgments have truth and falsehood. A judgment that is consistent with objective reality is a true judgment, and a judgment that is inconsistent with objective reality is a false judgment. Practice is the standard for testing the truth and falsehood of judgments. For example, "Marxism is science" is a true judgment, while "God exists" is a false judgment.

Judgments are expressed in sentences; the sentence that expresses a judgment is called a proposition.

Reasoning is formed by judgments. Reasoning is the deduction of new judgments from known judgments. Known judgments are called premises, and the deduced judgment is called the conclusion. Reasoning can provide new knowledge.

Reasoning is divided into direct reasoning and indirect reasoning. Direct reasoning is the deduction of a conclusion from one premise. For example, the deduction of the conclusion "Some sciences are useful" from the single premise "All sciences are useful" is a direct reasoning. Indirect reasoning is the deduction of a conclusion from two or more premises. For example, the deduction of the conclusion "History is useful" from the two premises "All sciences are useful, and history is a science" is an indirect reasoning. The form of this type of reasoning is: All C is B; A is C; therefore, A is B. Indirect reasoning is further divided into deductive reasoning (the example above is deductive reasoning), inductive reasoning, and transitive reasoning (including relational reasoning and analogical reasoning).

People not only use reasoning to obtain new judgments but also use proof to confirm known judgments. Proof is the use of other true judgments to confirm the truth of a certain judgment. The judgment being proven is called the thesis, and the judgments used to prove the thesis are called the arguments. For example, "The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is unbreakable; because the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is a friendship built on the great principles of Marxism-Leninism, and all friendships built on the great principles of Marxism-Leninism are unbreakable," is a proof. The judgment "The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is unbreakable" is the thesis, and the two judgments after "because" are the arguments, the truth of the thesis being confirmed by the arguments.

All scientific truths are proven. A judgment that has been proven is definitely reliable, while a judgment that has not been proven is probable (i.e., may be true or false). In the process of debate, a true thesis needs to be proven, and a false thesis needs to be refuted.

Formal logic not only explains the structure, types, rules, and functions of proof but also explains the methods of refutation, etc.

When people use concepts, judgments, reasoning, and proof to think, they need to abide by the four elementary laws of thinking. Abiding by them enables thinking to be definite, non-contradictory, and reasoned. Failure to abide by them leads to thinking that is confused, contradictory, and without reasoning. Definiteness, non-contradiction, and reasoning are the characteristics of true thinking.

Let's first take the law of identity as an example. The law of identity teaches us that thinking must have definiteness. That is, when using a concept, one must first clarify its meaning, and then, in the same thinking or debate process, use it with the same meaning, and not replace the concept that has already been used with a different concept. If this happens, one commits the "fallacy of equivocation."

For example, a rightist element, in order to defend his reactionary remarks, once put forward the following reasoning: "Daming dafang is the Party's policy; my remarks are daming dafang; therefore, my remarks are the Party's policy." This is truly absurd in the extreme. In this reasoning, he is precisely playing with logic and committing the fallacy of equivocation. In the two premises, the term "daming dafang" has different meanings. In the first premise, "daming dafang" refers to standing on a socialist position and offering well-intentioned opinions to the Party. In the second premise, "daming dafang" refers to rightist elements standing on a bourgeois position and maliciously attacking the Party.

Next, let's look at the law of contradiction. The law of contradiction teaches us that thinking must not have contradictions. That is, at the same time and from the same aspect, one cannot both say that A is B and say that A is not B; one cannot both say that something is white and say that it is black. If this happens, it is "self-contradictory." Self-contradictory ideas are false. For example, "He is a leftist, and he is not a leftist" is a self-contradictory and false judgment, because a person cannot be both a leftist and not a leftist at the same time.

Then, let's look at the law of excluded middle. The law of excluded middle teaches us that thinking must have clarity; people must choose one of two contradictory judgments. That is, when a question needs to be answered with "is" or "is not," one must answer clearly and not be ambiguous or vague. For example, when the traitor Trotsky joined the Bolshevik Party, he only vaguely stated regarding his past dirty history: "The fact that I joined the Bolshevik Party itself...this fact itself has proven that I have placed all those things that separated me from Bolshevism in front of the Party's door." This statement of his is truly a model of "ambiguity"! He neither said that he had completely discarded those reactionary things of the past, nor did he say that he had not discarded them, but vaguely said that he had "placed them in front of the Party's door." As Stalin pointed out, his "extremely vague statement" was a trick, the purpose of which was to "confuse the public and lead the audience astray." (See Stalin: "Concerning the Social Democratic Deviation in Our Party")

Finally, let's look at the law of sufficient reason. The law of sufficient reason teaches us that true judgments need sufficient reason. Sufficient reason refers to one or some true judgments, from which another true judgment can be deduced. There is a necessary connection between sufficient reason and the judgment being deduced. If the former is true, the latter must be true. For example, in proof, the arguments should be sufficient reasons for the thesis.

The law of sufficient reason requires us that the judgment used as a reason not only needs to be true but should also be a sufficient reason. If the judgment used as a reason is not true, or although it is true, it is not a sufficient reason, then one commits either the "fallacy of false cause" or the "fallacy of insufficient reason."

Let's give an example of committing the fallacy of insufficient reason. Modern revisionists slander the socialist state system as the source of bureaucratism. Their reason is that there is still bureaucratism in socialist countries, and they still need to oppose bureaucratism. It is obvious that modern revisionists are committing the fallacy of insufficient reason here. Bureaucratism is a remnant of the old system. And, on the contrary, we oppose bureaucratism precisely because bureaucratism is incompatible with the socialist state system.

From the above, it can be seen that formal logic is about explaining how to use concepts and judgments to conduct reasoning and proof. And reasoning and proof are necessary tools for people to obtain truth (true thinking) and express and demonstrate truth. Formal logic is the science concerning the elementary laws of thinking, forms of thinking, and proof that guide people to obtain true thinking.

II. The Role of Studying Formal Logic

Studying formal logic has the following roles:

First, studying formal logic enables people to consciously use elementary laws of thinking, forms of thinking, and proof, and can train people's thinking.

Of course, people who do not study formal logic can also use elementary laws of thinking, forms of thinking, and proof, but their use of them is unconscious. Because people who do not study formal logic do not understand their characteristics and functions, when using them, sometimes they use them correctly but do not know why they are correct, and sometimes they use them incorrectly but do not know why they are incorrect, and they are hesitant and dare not use some complex forms of thinking freely.

Studying formal logic enables people to understand the characteristics and functions of elementary laws of thinking, forms of thinking, and proof, and cultivate the habit of consciously using them. In the process of thinking, consciously using them is of great help to people in correctly using reasoning and proof to deduce and demonstrate truth.

Formal logic teaches people to clarify concepts, appropriately use judgments, make reasoning and proof logical, and conduct thinking in a non-contradictory and step-by-step manner. Therefore, studying formal logic can also train people's thinking, making thinking clear and organized, and cultivate the habit of thinking clearly and step-by-step.

Second, studying formal logic can train language, making language accurate and organized.

Language is the expression form of thinking, and thinking is the content of language. Formal logic not only explains forms of thinking in conjunction with words but also explains the relationship between concepts and words, and judgments and sentences. This is of great help to people in accurately using words and sentences to express concepts and judgments.

Studying formal logic can not only make language accurate but also make articles clear and organized. Great thinkers and writers in our country, such as Mozi, Wang Chong, and Lu Xun, all paid attention to formal logic. Their articles are all well-organized, logically strong, and persuasive. For example, Mozi's "Against Aggression" (Part One), the entire article is written using analogy, opposing the princes of the time attacking other countries, and is persuasive. Wang Chong's "On Death" uses a materialistic point of view, with logic as a tool, refuting "the dead become ghosts" and arguing "the dead do not become ghosts," with sufficient reasons, making people convinced. Lu Xun's articles are full of criticism, combativeness, and skillful use of metaphors. He paid attention to formal logic and wrote an article "The Soul of Debate," specifically excerpting the illogical remarks of the stubborn faction and many anti-reformers of the time.

Speaking of this, we should especially state that formal logic can only make thinking and language have preliminary clarity, accuracy, and logicality, while dialectical logic can make thinking and language more clear, accurate, and logical. Engels pointed out in his book "Dialectics of Nature" that "dialectical thinking" can make "thoughts clear." We know that the classic authors of Marxism are all masters of both dialectical logic and formal logic. Their articles all use words accurately, are clearly organized, consistent throughout, and have sufficient arguments, with great persuasive power. Stalin praised Lenin's speeches for having "an invincible logical force." Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is clear in organization, comprehensive in exposition, strong in argumentation, and uses words very accurately. In this article, all the main concepts are determined in meaning from the aspects of intension or extension, thus ensuring the accuracy of their wording.

From this, it can be seen that if we want to write well, we need not only to study grammar, rhetoric, and formal logic but also to study dialectical logic, because dialectical logic is the advanced thinking method that teaches us to observe problems comprehensively.

Furthermore, studying formal logic can also master a powerful weapon for exposing the enemy.

Studying formal logic can not only recognize one's own logical errors but also recognize the logical errors of others, and more politically significantly, can expose the logical errors of the enemy. When the enemy conducts debates, they often deliberately play with formal logic to engage in sophistry. For example, American imperialists, modern revisionists, and rightist elements in our country are like this. Therefore, when the classic authors of Marxism fought against the enemy and criticized their erroneous words and deeds, they not only used dialectics and dialectical logic to comprehensively analyze the errors of their words and deeds but also pointed out their formal logical errors at any time.

Finally, studying formal logic also helps to study and apply dialectical logic.

The relationship between formal logic and dialectical logic is like the relationship between elementary mathematics and advanced mathematics. We know that if people want to be masters of algebra, they must first be masters of arithmetic. Similarly, if we want to be masters of dialectical logic, we must first be masters of formal logic. Studying formal logic can help study dialectical logic because the content of the two is closely related. For example, both study forms of thinking. Understanding the research of formal logic on forms of thinking helps to understand the research of dialectical logic on forms of thinking. From the point of view of application, formal logic is an auxiliary tool of dialectical logic. When we use dialectical logic, we need to abide by formal logic, such as not being "self-contradictory," not "equivocating," etc. However, we should note that although dialectical logic abides by formal logic, it is not limited by it. For example, while it forbids thinking from being "self-contradictory," it also recognizes that things and thinking have inherent contradictions. Its main task is to reveal and resolve the inherent contradictions of things and thinking.

III. How to Study Formal Logic

How to study formal logic is a relatively complex issue. Here, only the following points are briefly discussed.

First, to study formal logic, one should first clarify the importance of studying it.

We have already said earlier that studying formal logic can make thinking and language clear and organized. And the ability to think and speak clearly and organized is a necessary condition for everyone engaged in socialist construction. Therefore, in our country, everyone with a certain level of education should study a little formal logic.

Second, to study formal logic, one should choose suitable readers and learn from the Soviet Union.

In formal logic, there has been a fierce struggle between the materialistic and idealistic schools since ancient times. Idealists distort formal logic in various ways. Therefore, those who are new to formal logic should pay attention to choosing readers. If one reads logical works with serious errors when studying for the first time, it will affect future study. "Logic" co-authored by Vinogradov and Kuzmin (published by People's Education Publishing House) is a Soviet middle school textbook. "Logic" written by Gorsky (same publisher) is a Soviet secondary normal school textbook. Both of these books are concise and succinct, and they have explanations on the main issues in formal logic, which are suitable for beginners to read. "Logic" written by Strogovich (published by People's Publishing House) and "Logic" edited by Gorsky and Tavants (published by Sanlian Bookstore) are suitable for further reading.

Third, to study formal logic, one must have a plan.

To study formal logic, it is best to set up a study plan. The plan can include learning goals, time, progress, readers, etc. Then study according to the plan and conduct inspections. You can first study a shallower work and then read a deeper one. When studying, you must have perseverance, have steps, and read chapter by chapter and section by section, and not be hot and cold.

Fourth, use the views of practice and reflection theory to study.

Elementary laws of thinking and forms of thinking come from practice and serve practice. Therefore, we must use the views of practice and reflection theory to study the source, content, and function of elementary laws of thinking and forms of thinking. We should link to objective things to understand their source and content. For example, with the form of a hypothetical judgment ("If A is B, then C is D"), it explains the relationship between the sufficient condition and the result of things, which is a reflection of the relationship between the sufficient condition and the result of objective things. We should link to our own thinking to study their functions. For example, when studying the law of identity, we should check whether our thinking has clarified the meanings of concepts in the past when using them, and whether we have committed the error of equivocation. In order to thoroughly understand the function of elementary laws of thinking and forms of thinking, one can also adopt typical examples of their application by others (correct and incorrect). Such examples can be selected from the books, documents, and newspapers and periodicals that one reads.

    谈谈学习形式逻辑
    李世繁
    逻辑有形式逻辑和辩证逻辑。形式逻辑是初等逻辑，辩证逻辑是高等逻辑。形式逻辑又称逻辑，或称普通逻辑。
    一、什么是形式逻辑
    形式逻辑是一门古老的初级思维科学。它研究四个初级的思维规律（同一律、矛盾律、排中律、充足理由律）、三种思维形式（概念、判断、推理）和证明。
    先讲思维形式。思维有内容和形式。思维的形式是指思维内容的共同点、结构。如以“形式逻辑是有用的”、“马克思主义是科学”两个判断来说，它们的内容是不一样的，它们的共同形式是：甲是乙。
    形式逻辑由相对静止的观点，结合语词（如“是”、“不是”、“有些”、“所有”、“如果……那末……”等词），研究概念、判断、推理三种思维形式的特征、种类、规则、作用，等等。
    由形式逻辑来看，概念是事物的本质属性的反映。如“平行四边形”一概念反映平行四边形的本质属性——“两组对边各相平行的四边形”。概念有不同的种类，如有普遍概念和单独概念。“人”是普遍概念，“鲁迅”是单独概念。
    概念用词来表达。概念和词的关系是内容和形式的关系。概念不能离开词而存在。
    判断是由概念和联系词“是”或“不是”形成的。如“马克思主义是科学”一判断，是由“马克思主义”、“科学”两概念和联系词“是”形成的。“修正主义不是马克思主义”一判断，是由“修正主义”、“马克思主义”两概念和联系词“不是”形成的。
    判断也有不同的种类，如有直言判断（见上例）、假言判断、选言判断。“如果进行技术改革，那末生产力就会迅速提高”，是一个假言判断。假言判断的形式是：如果甲是乙，那末丙就是丁。“战争或是正义的，或是非正义的”，是一个选言判断。选言判断的形式是：甲或是乙，或是丙。
    人们用判断进行思维，阐述事物。判断有真假。凡和客观现实相一致的判断是真判断，和客观现实不一致的判断是假判断。实践是检验判断真假的标准。如“马克思主义是科学”是一个真判断，“上帝是存在”则是一个假判断。
    判断用句子来表达，表达判断的句子叫命题。
    推理是由判断形成的。推理是由已知判断推出新判断。已知判断叫前提，被推出的判断叫结论。推理能提供新知识。
    推理分为直接推理和间接推理。直接推理是由一个前提推出一个结论。如由“所有科学都是有用的”一个前提推出“有些科学是有用的”一个结论，就是一个直接推理。间接推理是由两个或两个以上的前提推出一个结论。如由“所有科学都是有用的，历史学是科学”两个前提推出“历史学是有用的”一个结论，就是一个间接推理。这一类推理的形式是：所有丙都是乙；甲是丙；因此，甲是乙。间接推理又分为演绎推理（上例是演绎推理）、归纳推理、传递推理（包括关系推理和类比推理）。
    人们不仅用推理获得新判断，还用证明证实已知的判断。证明是用其它真实判断证实某一个判断的真实性。被证明的判断叫论题，用来证明论题的判断叫论据。如“中苏两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的；因为中苏两国人民的友谊是根据马克思主义的伟大的国际主义的原则而建立起来的友谊，而所有根据马克思主义的伟大的国际主义的原则而建立起来的友谊都是牢不可破的”，就是一个证明。“中苏两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的”这一个判断是论题，“因为”以后的两个判断是论据，论题的真实性由论据来证实。
    所有科学真理都是经过证明的。经过证明的判断是确实可靠的，没有经过证明的判断是或然的（即可真可假的）。在辩论过程，对真实的论题需要证明，对虚假的论题需要反驳。
    形式逻辑不仅讲解证明的结构、种类、规则、作用，还讲解反驳的方法，等等。
    人们运用概念、判断、推理和证明进行思维的时候，需要遵守四个初级的思维规律。遵守它们，能使思维确定、不矛盾、有论证。不遵守它们，就使思维混乱、矛盾、无论证。而确定、不矛盾、有论证，是真实思维的特征。
    先以同一律来说。同一律教导我们：思维要有确定性。即使用一个概念的时候，首先要明确它的意义，然后在同一思维或论辩过程里，用同一意义使用它，不得用不同的概念代替已被使用的概念。如果这样，就犯“偷换概念的错误”。
    如有一个右派分子为替他的反动言论做辩护，曾提出这样一个推理：“大鸣大放是党的政策；我的言论是大鸣大放；因此，我的言论是党的政策。”这真是荒谬到了极点。他在这个推理里，正是玩弄逻辑，犯了偷换概念的错误。在两个前提里，“大鸣大放”一词有不同的意思。在第一个前提里，“大鸣大放”是指站在社会主义立场，向党善意地提意见。在第二个前提里，“大鸣大放”是指右派分子站在资产阶级立场，向党恶意地进攻。
    次看矛盾律。矛盾律教导我们：思维不得有矛盾。即在同一时间内，由同一方面，不能既说甲是乙，又说甲不是乙，不能既说某一个东西是白的，又说它是黑的。如果这样，就是“自相矛盾”。自相矛盾的思想是虚假的。如“他是左派，又不是左派”，就是一个自相矛盾、虚假的判断，因为一个人不能既是左派，同时又不是左派。
    再看排中律。排中律教导我们：思维要有明确性，人们必须在两个矛盾判断里选择一个。即当问题需要用“是”或“不是”来回答的时候，要明确地回答，不得模棱两可、含糊其词。如叛徒托洛茨基当他加入布尔什维克党的时候，对他过去肮脏的历史，只含糊其词地声明说：“我加入布尔什维克党这件事实本身……这件事实本身已经证明，我已经把过去所有那些使我和布尔什维主义分开的东西放在党的门口了。”他的这个声明，真是“含糊不清”的典范！他既不说把过去那些反动的东西完全丢掉，也不说不丢掉，而含糊地说把它们“放在党的门口”。正像斯大林所指出的，他的“这个极端含糊的声明”是有诡计的，其目的在于“混淆视听，把听众引入迷途”。（见斯大林：“再论我们党内的社会民主主义倾向”）
    再看充足理由律。充足理由律教导我们：真实判断需要有充足理由。所谓充足理由是指这样一个或一些真实判断，由它或它们可以推证另一个真实判断。充足理由和被推证的判断之间有必然的联系。如果前者是真实的，后者就一定是真实的。如在证明里，论据就应是论题的充足理由。
    充足理由律要求我们：用做理由的判断不仅需要是真实的，而且应是充足理由。如果用做理由的判断是不真实的，或虽然是真实的，但不是充足理由，那末不是犯“虚假理由的错误”，就是犯“不充足理由的错误”。
    我们举一个犯不充足理由错误的例子。现代修正主义者诬蔑社会主义国家制度是官僚主义的根源。他们的理由是，社会主义国家还有官僚主义，并且还要反对官僚主义。显而易见，现代修正主义者在这里正犯了不充足理由的错误。官僚主义是旧制度的残余。并且，恰恰相反，我们反对官僚主义，正是因为官僚主义是同社会主义国家制度不相容的。
    由上可知，形式逻辑是讲解怎样运用概念和判断进行推理和证明。而推理和证明是人们获得真理（真实思维）、表达论证真理的必要工具。形式逻辑是关于引导人们获得真实思维的初级思维规律、思维形式和证明的科学。
    二、学习形式逻辑的作用
    学习形式逻辑有以下几种作用：
    首先，学习形式逻辑，能使人们自觉地运用初级的思维规律、思维形式和证明，能训练人们的思维。
    固然不学习形式逻辑的人也能运用初级的思维规律、思维形式和证明，但是他们对它们的运用是不自觉的。因为不学习形式逻辑的人，对它们的特征、作用是不了解的，所以当运用它们的时候，有时运用对了并不知道为什么是对的，运用错了也不知道是错的，对一些复杂的思维形式则缩手缩脚，不敢放手地使用。
    学习形式逻辑，能使人们了解初级的思维规律、思维形式和证明的特征、作用，养成人们自觉地运用它们的习惯。在思维过程，能自觉地运用它们，对人们正确地使用推理和证明来推出和论证真理有很大的帮助。
    形式逻辑教导人们要明确概念、恰当地运用判断，使推理和证明合乎逻辑性，要无矛盾地、循序渐进地进行思维。因此，学习形式逻辑也能训练人们的思维，使思维明确、有条理，养成明确地、循序渐进地思维的习惯。
    其次，学习形式逻辑能训练语言，使语言准确、有条理。
    语言是思维的表达形式，思维是语言的内容。形式逻辑不仅结合语词讲解思维形式，还说明概念和词、判断和句子之间的关系。这对人们准确地用词和句子来表达概念和判断，有很大的帮助。
    学习形式逻辑，不仅能使语言准确，还能使文章清楚、有条理。我国伟大的思想家，文学家，如墨子、王充、鲁迅等人，都很注意形式逻辑。他们的文章都组织严密、逻辑性强、有说服力量。如墨子的“非攻”上篇，全文用类比法写成，反对当时诸侯攻伐别的国家，有说服力量。王充的“论死”篇，用唯物主义的观点，以逻辑为工具，反驳“死人为鬼”、论证“死人不为鬼”，理由充足，使人信服。鲁迅的文章富有批判性、战斗性、善用比喻。他很注意形式逻辑，写有“论辩的魂灵”一文，专摘录当时的顽固派和许多反改革者的不合逻辑的言论。
    讲到这里，我们应当特别说明：形式逻辑只能使思维、语言有初步的明确性、准确性、逻辑性，辩证逻辑则能使思维、语言更有明确性、准确性、逻辑性。恩格斯在“自然辩证法”一书里指出：“辩证的思维”能使“思想清晰”。我们知道，马克思主义的经典作者都是辩证逻辑和形式逻辑的能手。他们的文章都用词准确、条理清楚、前后一贯、论证充足，有极大的说服力量。斯大林称赞列宁的演说有“不可战胜的逻辑力量”。毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文，条理清楚，阐述全面，论证性强，用词非常准确。在这篇文章里，凡是其中的主要概念，都由内涵或外延方面确定它们的意义，这样就保证了它们的语词的准确性。
    由此可知，我们要想写好文章，不仅需要学习语法、修辞、形式逻辑，更应学习辩证逻辑，因为辩证逻辑是教导我们全面地观察问题的高级的思维方法。
    再其次，学习形式逻辑还能掌握揭穿敌人的一种有力武器。
    学习形式逻辑不仅能认识自己的逻辑错误，也能认识别人的逻辑错误，更有政治意义的是能揭穿敌人的逻辑错误。敌人进行辩论的时候，常常故意地玩弄形式逻辑进行诡辩。如美帝国主义者、现代修正主义者、我国的右派分子就是这样。因此，马克思主义的经典作者当和敌人作斗争、批判他们的错误言行的时候，不仅用辩证法、辩证逻辑全面地分析他们的言行的错误，也随时指出他们的形式逻辑的错误。
    最末，学习形式逻辑还有助于学习和运用辩证逻辑。
    形式逻辑和辩证逻辑两者之间的关系，正像初等数学和高等数学两者之间的关系。我们知道，人们要想在代数上是能手，必须先在算术上是能手。同样，我们要想在辩证逻辑上是能手，必须先在形式逻辑上是能手。学习形式逻辑所以能帮助学习辩证逻辑，因为它们两者的内容有密切关系。如它们两者都研究思维形式，了解了形式逻辑对思维形式的研究，有助于了解辩证逻辑对思维形式的研究。由应用方面来看，形式逻辑是辩证逻辑的辅助工具。我们运用辩证逻辑，需要遵守形式逻辑，如不得“自相矛盾”、“偷换概念”等等。但是，我们要注意：辩证逻辑虽然遵守形式逻辑，但是并不受它的限制。如它一方面禁止思维“自相矛盾”，另一方面则承认事物和思维有内在矛盾。它的主要任务就在揭露和解决事物和思维的内在矛盾。
     三、怎样学习形式逻辑
    怎样学习形式逻辑是一个比较复杂的问题。在这里，只简单地讲以下几点。
    第一，学习形式逻辑，首先应明确学习它的重要性。
    在前面我们已经讲过：学习形式逻辑能使思维和语言清楚、有条理。而思维和语言能清楚、有条理，是每一个从事社会主义建设的人所应必备的条件。因此，在我们国家里，凡是具有一定文化水平的人，都应学习一点形式逻辑。
    第二，学习形式逻辑，应选择适宜的读本，学习苏联。
    在形式逻辑里，自古以来就有激烈的唯物主义和唯心主义两派的斗争。唯心主义者从各方面对形式逻辑进行歪曲。因此，初学形式逻辑的人，要注意选择读本。如果初次学习就阅读了有严重错误的逻辑著作，那就影响了以后的学习。维诺格拉多夫和库兹明合著的“逻辑学”（人民教育出版社出版），是苏联中学教科书。高尔斯基著的“逻辑学”（同上），是苏联中等师范教科学。这两本书都简明扼要，对形式逻辑中的主要问题都有阐述，适于初学人阅读。斯特罗果维契著的“逻辑”（人民出版社出版）和高尔斯基、塔瓦涅茨主编的“逻辑”（三联书店出版），适于进一步地阅读。
    第三，学习形式逻辑，要有计划。
    学习形式逻辑，最好定出一个学习计划。在计划里，可包括学习的目标、时间、进度、读本，等等。然后按计划去学习，并进行检查。可先学习一本较浅的著作，然后再阅读较深的。学习的时候，要有恒心、有步骤、要逐章逐段地阅读，不可忽冷忽热。
    第四，应用实践和反映论的观点去学习。
    初级的思维规律和思维形式是由实践中来、为实践服务的。因此，我们要用实践和反映论的观点，研究初级的思维规律和思维形式的来源、内容和作用。我们应联系客观事物，理解它们的来源和内容。如以假言判断的形式（“如果甲是乙，那末丙就是丁”）来说，它讲解事物的充足条件和结果之间的关系，是客观事物的充足条件和结果之间的关系的反映。我们应联系自己的思维，研究它们的作用。如学习同一律的时候，要检查自己的思维在过去使用概念的时候，是否明确了它们的意义，是否犯过偷换概念的错误。为了能透彻地了解初级的思维规律和思维形式的作用，还可采取别人对它们应用的典型例子（正确的和错误的）。这类例子可由自己所阅读的书籍、文件、报刊中选择。
