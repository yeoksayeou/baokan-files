    What is Television?
    Gao Rongkun

    In the great leap forward situation across the country, the television broadcasts designed and manufactured by our own country have been successfully test broadcast in Beijing. Many viewers have enjoyed many interesting programs from television receivers, and at the same time, some people have asked: "What is television all about?"

    Generally speaking, television is the use of a television camera tube to convert a "light image" into an "electrical image," and then use electrical methods to transmit the television image signal. Finally, a television picture tube restores the "electrical image" to the original "light image." This involves a very complicated electrical process, but all these processes are completed in an instant. Therefore, television can immediately broadcast what is happening now, with sound and color, to other places.

    To understand the basic principles of television, you must first understand some photoelectric phenomena: For example, some metals (cesium, rubidium, potassium, etc.) will emit electrons when illuminated by light, and the number of electrons emitted is proportional to the intensity of the light shining on it.

    Television technology uses this photoelectric phenomenon. People spread millions of isolated fine silver particles on a very thin mica sheet, and then cover it with a thin layer of photosensitive metal to make a photosensitive mosaic screen with millions of "photoelectric elements." The photosensitive mosaic screen is placed in a vacuum glass tube to make a television camera tube. In front of the camera tube, a lens similar to a camera is placed, and the photosensitive mosaic screen replaces the photographic film. When the actor stands in front of the lens, the light reflected from various parts of the actor onto the photosensitive mosaic screen not only forms optical images of different brightness, but also forms an "electrical image" due to the electronic reaction of the photoelectric elements. Naturally, this "electrical image" is composed of millions of "photoelectric elements," which analyzes an image into millions of points, that is, after "image resolution."

    To transform this "electrical image" into a "television signal" also requires the application of the principle of "scanning": using an electron beam to move regularly from left to right and from top to bottom on the mosaic screen, the "electrical image" becomes a series of "television signals" in an orderly manner. Generally speaking, the "television signal" obtained in this way is very weak and needs to be amplified by an "amplifier" before being sent to a television radio transmitter to become television radio waves and spread into outer space. At the receiving end, these television radio waves are received and amplified by an "amplifier," and then the "television signal" is detected by a "detector." In this way, the "television signal" from the sending end is obtained at the receiving end.

    The last task is to restore the received "television signal" to the original optical image. This utilizes luminescent substances, such as mixtures of metals zinc, cadmium, calcium, etc., and non-metals silicon and oxygen. When high-speed electrons bombard these substances coated on the glass screen wall, they emit various colors of light. This glass screen wall is called a "fluorescent screen," and when it is made into a television receiving tube, it is called a "television picture tube." In order to display an image on the screen of the picture tube, it is also necessary to apply the "scanning" method. Exactly the same as the electron beam in the television camera tube, here an electron beam is also used to move back and forth in the picture tube, turning the received television signal into hundreds of thousands or millions of bright spots of different brightness. Because the electron beam moves very quickly, and there are so many light-emitting spots, and more importantly because the human eye has the characteristic of "visual persistence," people see a clear and soft image on the fluorescent screen. The "electrical image" is restored to the "light image."

    Currently, viewers in the Beijing area with television receivers can watch television programs on Thursday and Sunday evenings. However, it is not easy to receive programs in areas far from Beijing, which requires the television antenna of the television broadcast station to be erected in a very high place in order to transmit television radio waves to more distant places. In addition, radio long-distance relay methods or coaxial cables can be used to connect major cities for rebroadcasting. Soviet scientists have also proposed using airplanes as television relay stations so that more and more distant places can receive television programs. Recently, Soviet scientist Varvarov further pointed out that as long as three fixed artificial earth satellites are launched into the high altitude of 35,800 kilometers, and equipped with wide-band television receiving and transmitting devices, television broadcasts can be sent to the whole world.

    电视是怎么回事？
    高荣坤
    在全国大跃进的形势下，我国自己设计制造的电视广播，已经在北京试播成功了。不少观众从电视接收机里欣赏了许多有趣的节目，同时，也有的人问道：“电视是怎么回事？”
    总的说来，电视就是用电视摄像管将“光的图像”变成“电的图像”，然后再用电的方法去传送电视图像信号，最后由电视显影管把“电的图像”恢复成原来的“光的图像”。这中间是经过了十分复杂的电过程，但是所有这些过程都是在一刹那间完成的。所以电视能够将现在发生的事情，立刻有声有色地传播到其他地方去。
    要了解电视的基本原理，先要知道一些光电现象：例如有一些金属（铯、铷、钾等）在光线照射下，就会放出电子来，而且放出电子的数目和照在它上面的光的强弱成比例。
    在电视科学技术里利用了这种光电现象。人们在一块很薄的云母片上，铺上数百万颗互相隔离的细银粒，然后再盖上一层薄薄的感光金属做成有数百万颗“光电元件”的感光嵌镶幕。将这块感光嵌镶幕放在真空玻璃管里，做成电视摄像管。在摄像管的前面，放一个类似照相机的镜头，感光嵌镶幕也就代替了照相用的胶片。　　当演员站在镜头前面的时候，从演员身上各部分反映到感光嵌镶幕上的光线，不仅形成了明暗不同的光学图像，同时由于光电元件的电子反应，还构成了一幅“电的图像”。自然，这幅“电的图像”既是由数百万颗“光电元件”组成的，这就将一幅图像分析成数百万个点，也就是经过了“析像”。
    将这幅“电的图像”变成“电视信号”还需要应用“扫描”的原理：利用一根电子射线束，在嵌镶幕上有规律地从左到右，从上到下地移动，“电的图像”也就有次序地变成了一连串的“电视信号”。一般说来，这样得到的“电视信号”是很微弱的，需要经过“放大器”放大，然后再送到电视无线电发射机，变成电视无线电波，散布到宇宙空间去。而在接收的地方，把这些电视无线电波收下来，并且经过“放大器”放大，再用“检波器”把“电视信号”检出来。这样，在接收的地方便得到了发送地方的“电视信号”。
    最后一个任务，就是要将接收到的“电视信号”恢复成原来的光学图像。这是利用发光的物质，例如金属锌、镉、钙等及非金属硅、氧的混合物。将它们涂在玻璃屏壁上，当高速度的电子轰击这些物质时，便会发出各种颜色的光来。这块玻璃屏壁叫做“萤光屏”，做成电视接收管时，就叫做“电视显影管”。为了在显影管的屏幕上显出图像来，还需要应用“扫描”的方法。和电视摄像管里的电子束完全相同，这里也是利用一根电子射线束在显影管里来回移动，把接收到的电视信号，变成数十万、数百万颗明暗不同的亮点。由于电子束移动得非常迅速，发光点子又是如此之多，更重要的是因为人的眼睛有“视觉暂留”的特点，因此，人就在萤光屏幕上看到一幅清晰而柔和的图像。“电的图像”又重新恢复成“光的图像”了。
    目前，北京地区有电视接收机的观众都能够在星期四和星期日的晚上看到电视节目。但是离北京很远的地区就不易收到，这就需要将电视广播台的电视天线，架在很高的地方，以便把电视无线电波传送到更远的地方去。此外还可以用无线电长途接力的方法，或者是用同轴电缆线将各大城市连接起来，然后进行转播。苏联科学家还曾提出用飞机做电视转播站的方法，使更多更远的地方也都能收到电视节目。最近，苏联科学家瓦尔瓦罗夫更指出：只要向三万五千八百公里的高空发射三个固定的人造地球卫星，装上波段很宽的电视接收和发射装置，就可以向全世界发送电视广播了。（附图片）
