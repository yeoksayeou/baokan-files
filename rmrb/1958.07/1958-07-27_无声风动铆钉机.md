Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, July 26th: Leng Chuanxing, a young technician from Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant who started as a riveter, has recently successfully created a silent pneumatic riveting machine with the assistance of veteran riveters. This novel riveting machine is hailed by workers as the "riveter's friend."

Ordinary pneumatic riveting machines make deafening noises during riveting, but this new riveting machine has no noise at all, preventing the occupational disease of "nine out of ten riveters are deaf," which has been a long-standing problem. In the past, riveters had to hold onto constantly vibrating rivet guns, but now they only need to press the air valve switch of the new riveting machine to quickly rivet a rivet with excellent quality.

After the factory director participated in labor by cultivating "experimental plots" in the workshop in May of this year, he proposed to the entire factory staff the technical innovation task of creating a silent automated riveting machine. Leng Chuanxing, a member of the Communist Youth League, could not sleep all night after hearing the director's call. He thought: The country has cultivated me from a riveter to a technician, and as a member of the Communist Youth League, I should take the lead in daring to think and act. The workshop director also organized veteran riveters and technicians to form a research team to help him research and trial-produce.

This cylindrical riveting machine, because it is heavier than a rivet gun, can be fixed on a machine tool or suspended on an overhead slide for riveting steel plates and other components. Currently, Leng Chuanxing and others are further researching and manufacturing lightweight silent riveting machines.

    无声风动铆钉机
    据新华社齐齐哈尔26日电　齐齐哈尔车辆厂铆工出身的青年技术员冷传兴，最近在老铆工的协助下，创造成功了无声风动铆钉机。这台新颖的铆钉机被工人们誉为“铆工之友”。
    一般风动铆钉机在铆钉时，总要发出震耳欲聋的响声，而这台新的铆钉机却一点没有嘈音，防止了长期来一直没有解决的“十个铆工九个聋”的职业病。过去铆工们要按住不断震动着的铆钉枪操作，现在只要按一下新铆钉机的风门开关，就很快铆好了一个铆钉，质量也非常好。
    这个厂的厂长在今年5月份到车间种“试验田”参加劳动后，向全厂职工提出创造无声自动化铆钉机的技术革新课题。共青团员冷传兴听了厂长号召后，一宿也没有睡着觉，他想：国家把自己从铆工匠培养成为技术员，做为一个共青团员应当带头敢想敢干。车间主任还组织了老铆工和技术员成立了一个研究小组，帮助他研究和试制。
    这台圆筒形的铆钉机由于体积比铆钉枪重，可以固定的装置在机台上，或吊装在架空滑道上进行铆接钢板等部件。目前，冷传兴等正在进一步研究制造轻便的无声铆钉机。
