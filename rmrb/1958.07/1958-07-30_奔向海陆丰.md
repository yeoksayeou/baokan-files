Marching to Haifeng and Lufeng
Marshal of the People's Republic of China Xu Xiangqian

In the early days of the Red Army, many units were built from scratch, empty-handed.

A few hours before the Guangzhou Uprising, the Sixth Detachment of the Workers' Red Guards secretly gathered in the homes of several workers, making tense combat preparations for the uprising. Without a single gun or a grenade, everyone sat around a broken table, lit an oil lamp, and watched me draw on paper with a pencil, explaining how to use the terrain, how to throw grenades, how to charge... This was truly "armchair strategy" in the truest sense. I was a newcomer, unable to speak Cantonese, and some things I explained over and over, but the comrades still didn't understand. Fortunately, the party representative of the detachment was a local, a capable worker who spoke Mandarin, and acted as a translator while learning military knowledge.

Many of the people in the Sixth Detachment had participated in the Hong Kong-Guangdong Strike. Some were party members, some were leftists who supported the revolution, and their revolutionary enthusiasm was high. Since the failure of the Nanchang Uprising, the Party had been actively preparing to hold an armed uprising in Guangzhou to resist the Kuomintang's massacre of workers and communists. At this time, the Party sent me to serve as the detachment leader of the Sixth Detachment of the Workers' Red Guards, to conduct some secret military training for the workers. The workers often held meetings in batches at night, studying and engaging in tense secret activities, preparing for an armed uprising. When we received the order from the higher authorities to launch the uprising, comrades' eyes sparkled with surprise and tension. If they hadn't been afraid of leaking information, people would have shouted aloud immediately. But at that time, they could only whisper, "Our iron rulers, axes, kitchen knives, and sticks are all ready, it would be even better if we had a few more pistols and some bombs!"

We had already sent people to collect weapons, but it was conceivable that there wouldn't be many. The comrades looked at me and the party representative, and the party representative and I looked at each other. People's eyes seemed to be saying in unison: "Weapons, weapons!..."

"Brothers!" An old worker who had participated in the Hong Kong-Guangdong Strike gently knocked on the table, breaking the silence: "Making revolution is not about eating ready-made meals. If we can't get weapons, we can seize them from the enemy!"

"That's right, this comrade is right," the party representative waved his fist and said, "We the working class have always relied on these two hands to eat, if we don't have guns, we'll use kitchen knives, iron rulers, and sticks!"

"That's right! That's the way!"

"We must seize the enemy's weapons to arm ourselves!" The worker comrades all waved their fists.

We began to study the combat actions of street fighting. Before long, a young female comrade, carrying a vegetable basket, walked in. She wrapped her head, revealing only her eyes, and silently put the vegetable basket on the table. The party representative suddenly stood up and said happily, "The weapons are here!" At this time, the woman lifted the vegetables covering the basket, revealing two pistols and several grenades. Everyone was mentally prepared and didn't complain about the small quantity. Only one comrade asked, "Can you give us more?"

"That's all there is," the woman said, "There will be as many as you want after the uprising."

"Having two guns is already a lot," the party representative said confidently. Then he distributed the grenades to several experienced workers. Everyone learned how to use them while waiting for the signal to start the uprising.

That night, Guangzhou was particularly silent, the streets and alleys seemed exceptionally solemn, and time passed particularly slowly. The party representative kept looking at his old pocket watch, afraid that it had stopped, and repeatedly put it to his ear to listen and shake it.

"What do you say is happening elsewhere?" he asked me.

"The Workers' Red Guards in each district are almost all assembled," I said, "Now, they are like many torrents held back by a dam, as soon as the gate is opened, they will surge forth."

After midnight, a burst of gunfire rang out in the city. This gunfire told us that the main force of the uprising—the Teaching Regiment—was in action. According to the pre-arranged combat deployment, we rushed out of the alley, and before the police guarding the road could figure out what was going on, their guns were confiscated. We got a few rifles, no longer empty-handed, and immediately took control of the streets and alleys assigned to the Sixth Detachment, and contacted the General Headquarters.

In the morning, the sun rose from the east, illuminating the new, boiling city of Guangzhou. The Guangzhou Soviet Government was declared established. Red flags fluttered on the roads, and slogans and leaflets were posted everywhere. The uprising soldiers, with red scarves tied around their necks, sang the Internationale and the Young Pioneers song, running through the streets and alleys. Some of the uprising troops were comrades who had just been rescued from prison, they wore long hair, held weapons, and started fighting again.

A part of our detachment was ordered to go to the vicinity of the General Headquarters (the old site of the Public Security Bureau), re-organized the team, and went to a large courtyard filled with captured weapons and ammunition, received rifles and bullets, and were fully armed. At this time, the Sixth Detachment had become an even more combat-effective force.

Early on the twelfth, the uprising army had occupied most of Guangzhou. Gunfire rang out sporadically in the city. The reactionary strongholds of the Public Security Bureau, the Provincial Government, etc. had long been destroyed by us, but some remaining strongholds were still stubbornly resisting.

Guanyin Mountain was always the main area of combat. The Kuomintang's Third Division, led by Xue Yue, had been reinforced from the North River to Guangzhou, and under the cover of gunboats, repeatedly attacked Guanyin Mountain. A part of the Teaching Regiment held their ground, heroically fighting back. On this day, the task of our detachment was partly to cooperate with the comrades of the Second Company of the Teaching Regiment in combat, and partly to transport ammunition. The comrades of the Workers' Red Guards were very brave. When transporting ammunition through the blockade line, if the person in front fell, the second person would run forward; if the second person fell, the third person would rush up. The party representative of our detachment was seriously injured in a counterattack against the enemy's charge on Guanyin Mountain. He tightly grasped my hand and said, "Comrades, continue to fight! I hope you will resolutely repel the enemy's counterattack and hold the detachment's position." After speaking, he closed his eyes! This immortal warrior of the working class had dedicated his precious life.

I can't recall the real name of this comrade-in-arms, I only remember his code name was "Old Chen." Because at that time, most of our names were fake. However, his heroic spirit, optimistic revolutionary spirit, and strong will will never be forgotten!

The battle became increasingly tense, the enemy was approaching from all sides, and the uprising army was completely on the defensive, some positions had to be abandoned. Our detachment had strict discipline and was not allowed to find things to eat casually. We didn't have our own kitchen, so some workers had to go home to eat when they were hungry. The enemy's frantic counterattack and fierce fighting were underway, and the detachment's casualties became larger and larger, and the number of people smaller and smaller.

Late at night. A burst of gunfire rang out at the foot of Guanyin Mountain, and then gradually subsided. The road to the headquarters was about to be cut off by the enemy, and we lost contact with the headquarters. At this time, a comrade Zhu from the Teaching Regiment happened to pass by and ran up to me as soon as he saw me, saying: "Brother, what are you still doing here? The headquarters has already ordered a retreat. Didn't you receive the order?"

"No."

"Headquarters orders to gather at Huanghuagang."

I immediately explained the situation to the comrades of the detachment, and with some other people who had not had time to withdraw, took advantage of the darkness before dawn to rush to Huanghuagang. When we got there, we saw that the main force had already transferred to Huaxian.

At this time, the counter-revolutionary troops had controlled all the main roads. We couldn't stay, so we hurriedly chased after the main force, and didn't catch up with the comrades of the Teaching Regiment until six o'clock in the afternoon in Taihexu.

The reactionary armed militia of the landlords set up an ambush on the road to Huaxian—in a place surrounded by two mountains at the foot of Elephant Mountain—to block us, attempting to eliminate this surviving people's armed force. We broke through the enemy's encirclement, defeated the enemy's ambush, and retreated to Huaxian County in the evening. The reactionaries here had long fled upon hearing the news.

Hearing from people who escaped from Guangzhou that counter-revolutionaries were carrying out a large-scale massacre there. The streets of Guangzhou were filled with the corpses of revolutionaries. The enemy seemed to have contracted "Red Scare," as long as they found a piece of red cloth or silk from a house, or caught someone who spoke with a northern accent, they would kill them on the spot without asking any questions; even brides wearing red clothes were pushed into the fire and burned. However, the enemy's massacre could not scare us, and those of us who were alive were determined to continue fighting and would not stop until victory was achieved.

On the sixteenth, we held a Party meeting in a school in Huaxian to discuss the reorganization of the troops and future actions. There were more than 1,200 people who retreated to Huaxian. It was too few people to form a division; it was a bit too many to form a regiment. After discussion, it was decided to form a division. But which division to form? Everyone knew that after the Nanchang Uprising, Comrade Zhu De established the First Red Division in the North River, and there was a Second Red Division in Haifeng and Lufeng.

"Let's call it the Third Red Division!" some comrades suggested.

"There is already a Third Red Division," some said, "The guerrillas of Qiongya have been organized into the Third Red Division."

After counting and counting, the number of the Fourth Division was not yet taken. So, we ourselves named it the Fourth Division of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. The entire division was divided into three regiments: the Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth. Ye Yong was the division commander, Yuan Yu (Guoping) was the party representative, and Wang Kanru was the director of the political department. I was appointed as the party representative of the Tenth Regiment.

The second urgent problem was that Huaxian was too close to Guangzhou and adjacent to the railway, so we couldn't stay for too long and had to act immediately. Where to go? After discussing for a long time, it was decided to go to the North River to join the First Red Division led by Comrade Zhu De. But no one knew where they were. We rectified the troops while sending scouts to inquire.

At this time, the landlord armed militia of Huaxian was besieging us outside the city day and night. The supply of the troops was also very difficult. The personnel we sent to inquire about the news were not heard from for a day or two. By the third day, we couldn't wait any longer. We estimated that the enemy in Guangzhou would soon catch up, and it would be passive to leave then. On the third day, another meeting was held, and it was decided to go to Haifeng and Lufeng to find Comrade Peng Pai. There, backed by high mountains and facing the sea, the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Government had already been established.

At night, we repelled the militia besieging the city, and the troops began to depart. We passed through Conghua, Liangkou, Longmen, and Hangzitan, detoured around Lankou and crossed the East River, and occupied Zijing County and other places, repelling several harassments by the militia. Later, we met the Red Guards of Haifeng in Longwo. On the first day of the lunar new year, we arrived in Haifeng County. Comrade Peng Pai had led three peasant uprisings in this area. The first two failed, and the third time, on November 1, 1927, he occupied Haifeng City. The Soviet regime was officially established on November 7. The land revolution was in full swing, the masses were very enthusiastic, and red flags were flying everywhere. On the walls of the villages, red slogans were written: "Down with the local tyrants and evil gentry, implement the land revolution." When the masses heard that we were the Red Army from Guangzhou, they were extremely enthusiastic, letting us stay in their houses and boiling water to cook for us. Although we couldn't understand the language, people gesticulated to express their love for the Red Army. After a long journey, we felt like we had returned to our own home.

On the second day of the first month of the lunar year, a mass rally of tens of thousands of people was held on the Red Square in Haifeng City to welcome our Fourth Red Division. Soviet Chairman Comrade Peng Pai spoke at the meeting. He was only in his twenties, not tall, with a long and white face, completely like a one hundred percent weak scholar. He wore ordinary peasant clothes and a pair of straw sandals. The peasants of Haifeng and Lufeng all called him "Peng Bodhisattva." His loud voice, revolutionary enthusiasm, strong will, and confidence in the future of the revolution were all unforgettable to us. When he spoke about the failure of the Guangzhou Uprising, he waved his hand and said, "This is nothing, although we failed, but we failed gloriously. We communists have never cared about failure or feared difficulties. If we fail, we'll do it again. If we fall, we'll get up. The revolution will succeed one day." His highly logical, persuasive, and easy-to-understand speech touched the hearts of the listeners in every sentence, increasing their infinite courage and perseverance.

Soon, our Fourth Red Division and the Second Red Division led by Comrade Dong Lang met. Under the leadership of Comrade Peng Pai, the two young troops fought many victorious battles. Our Fourth Red Division successively captured Lufeng City and Jiazigang, and eliminated the largest stronghold of the landlord armed forces that isolated the connection between the Soviet areas of Lufeng and Puning—Guolong—making the Soviet areas of Lufeng and Puning one continuous area.

The Kuomintang warlords would not allow the Soviet regime in Haifeng and Lufeng to exist peacefully, and soon they began their "encirclement and suppression" of the Soviet area of Haifeng and Lufeng. Huang Xuchu's troops attacked the Soviet area from the west and north, occupying Haifeng and Lufeng. Chen Mingshu's newly compiled Eleventh Division also came from Fujian, using Huicheng as a stronghold to attack the Soviet area of Hui and Chao. Although the Fourth Red Division initially defeated the Xiang Zhuoran regiment of the division and captured Huilai, it eventually had to retreat into the Sankeng mountainous area of Puning to maneuver with the enemy due to the enemy's excessive strength.

At that time, our young Red Army only knew how to fight battles and attack cities, and did not pay attention to consolidating the base areas. After many battles, the number of troops shrank day by day. The enemy's "encirclement and suppression" became increasingly fierce. They burned wherever they went, and killed in every village. They burned down all the houses where the Red Army had stayed; they buried alive or killed anyone who had had contact with the Red Army. In order to preserve the last part of the armed forces, our army had no choice but to retreat from Sankeng to the mountainous area of Daan Cave and Hot Spring Cave in Haifeng, to fight guerrillas in cooperation with the local guerrillas.

The people are always of one heart with the Red Army. Young people, old people, and women outside the mountains often risked their lives to send food to the mountains. Sometimes, when food could not be supplied, the soldiers went down to the river to catch small fish and found wild vegetables on the hillside to satisfy their hunger. In winter, they had no place to live, so they cut grass to build houses; without quilts, they covered themselves with straw to spend the night. Every time the enemy went to the mountains for "encirclement and suppression," they would definitely set fire to the thatched houses, but after they left, we would rebuild them. Burn the east mountain, build the west mountain, burn the west mountain, build the south mountain. Just as our great poet Bai Juyi wrote in his poem, "The wildfire cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows and it grows again." The young Red Army struggled and grew in extremely difficult circumstances. . . .

    奔向海陆丰
    中华人民共和国元帅　徐向前
    红军初创，有许许多多的部队，是赤手空拳搞起来的。
    广州起义前的几小时，工人赤卫队第六联队秘密地集合在几个工人的家里，进行着起义前的紧张的战斗准备工作。没有一支枪，没有一颗手榴弹，大家围着一张破桌  子，点着油灯，看我用一枝铅笔在纸上画，怎样利用地形，怎样打手榴弹，怎样冲锋，……这真是名副其实的“纸上谈兵”。我是外乡人，广东话说不来，有些话翻来复去讲半天，同志们还是听不懂。幸得联队的党代表是本地人，是一个精干的工人，会说普通话，一面学习军事知识一面当翻译。
    第六联队的人，有许多是参加过省港罢工的。有的是党员，有的是赞助革命的左派，他们的革命热情很高，自从南昌起义失败，党就积极准备在广州举行武装起义，以抗击国民党对工人和共产党人的大屠杀。这时党派我担任工人赤卫队第六联队的联队长，对工人进行一些秘密的军事训练。工人们经常在晚上分批的开会，学习，进行着紧张的秘密活动，准备武装起义。当我们接到了上级决定起义的命令的时候，同志们的眼里都闪着惊喜、紧张的光芒。如果不是怕走漏风声，人们会立刻高声呼叫起来。而当时只能低声地纷纷说：“我们的铁尺、斧头、菜刀、棍子都准备好了，要再有几枝手枪和一些炸弹就更好了！”
    我们已经派人领武器去了，但是，可以想得到，武器是不会多的。同志们望着我和党代表，而我和党代表则相互望着。人们的眼睛像在齐声说：“武器，武器！……”
      “兄弟们！”一个曾经参加过省港罢工的老工人轻轻地敲着桌子，打破沉寂：“闹革命不是吃现成饭。领不来武器，我们可以夺取敌人的枪！”
      “对，这位同志说的对，”党代表挥着拳头说：“我们工人阶级，从来就靠这两手吃，没有枪，拿菜刀、铁尺、棍子！”
      “对！就这样！”
      “我们一定要夺取敌人的武器来武装自己！”工人同志们都挥挥拳头。
    我们开始研究巷战的战斗动作。不多会，走进来一位年轻的、提着一只菜篮子的女同志。她包着头，只露两只眼，一声不响把菜篮子放到桌上。党代表猛地站起，高兴地说：“武器来了！”这时，那个妇女把盖在篮子上的菜掀掉，露出两枝手枪，几个手榴弹。大家早有了思想准备，没嫌少。只有一个同志问了一句：“还能多给点吗？”
    “没有了。”那位女同志说：“暴动起来以后要多少都有。”
    “有两枝枪就不少。”党代表充满信心的说。接着把手榴弹分给几个有经验的工人。大家一面学着使用，一面等着起义的讯号。
    那天晚上，广州的城里格外的沉寂，大街小巷似乎分外的严肃，时间过得特别慢。党代表总是看他那只老怀表，生怕它不走了，不时放在耳朵上听听，摇摇。
    “你说现在别处的情况怎么样？”他问我。
      “各区的工人赤卫队都差不多集合起来了。”我说，“现在，正像被闸住的许多股洪水，只要闸门
  一开，就会奔流起来。”
    午夜以后，市区里响起了一阵枪声。这枪声告诉我们：起义的主
  力部队——教导团行动了。我们按
  照预先的战斗部署，冲出巷口，守马路的警察还没有弄明白怎么回事，枪就被缴了。我们得了几枝长枪，不再赤手空拳，立刻把第六联队分担的大街小巷控制起来，和总指挥部取上了联系。
    早晨，太阳从东方升起来，照着新的、沸腾的广州城。广州苏维埃政府宣布成立了。马路上红旗飘扬，标语、传单贴的到处都是。脖子上扎红领带的起义军，高唱着国际歌，少年先锋队歌，在大街小巷奔走。起义队伍里，有些是刚从监狱里救出来的同志，他们披着长头发，拿着武器，又开始了战斗。
    我们联队的一部奉命开到总司令部（公安局旧址）附近，重新编好了队伍，到一个堆着很多缴获武器、弹药的大院里，领到了步枪、子弹，全部武装起来。这时六联队已成为一支更加有战斗力的部队了。
    十二号一早，起义军已占领了广州市大部。枪声在市区稀稀落落地响着。反动的据点公安局、省政府等早已被我们摧毁，但仍有一些残余的据点进行着顽强的抵抗。
    观音山，始终是战斗的主要地区。国民党的第三师薛岳部已从北江增援到广州，在炮舰掩护下，多次攻夺观音山。教导团的一部分坚守阵地，英勇还击。这天，我们联队的任务一部分配合教导团的第二连的同志们作战，一部分是搬运弹药。工人赤卫队的同志们十分英勇，搬运弹药通过封锁线的时候，前头的人倒了，第二个人又往前跑；第二个人倒了，第三个人又冲了上去。我们联队的党代表，在反击观音山敌人的一次冲锋中负了重伤。他紧紧握住我的手说：“同志，你们继续战斗吧！希望你们坚决的打退敌人的反攻，守住联队的阵地。”说完就闭上了眼！这位不朽的工人阶级的战士，已献出了自己宝贵的生命。
    我回忆不起这位战友的真实姓名，只记得他的代号是“老陈”。因为，当时我们的姓名大多是假的。但是，他那种英雄的气概，乐观的革命精神和坚强的意志，使我永远不会忘掉！
    战斗越来越紧张了，敌人四面进迫，起义军完全处于防守状态了，有些阵地不得不退出。我们联队的纪律严明，不准随便找东西吃，自己没有伙房，有些工人饿了，只得回家去吃饭。敌人疯狂的反击，激烈的战斗进行着，联队的队员伤亡越来越大，人数越来越少。
    深夜。观音山下响了一阵枪，接着就渐渐地平息了。通往指挥部的道路快被敌人截断了，我们和指挥部失掉了联络。这时，恰巧教导团的一个朱同志由此过路，一见到我就跑上来说：“老兄，你们还在这里干什么？指挥部早已下命令撤退了。你没接到命令？”
      “没有。”
    “总部命令，到黄花岗集合。”
    我立刻向联队的同志们说明情况，和另外一些没来得及撤走的人，趁天还没亮，赶到黄花岗。到那里一看，主力部队已向花县转移了。
    这时，反革命的部队已经控制了各要路。我们不能停留，连忙向主力追赶，直到下午六点钟，才在太和圩赶上了教导团的同志们。
    地主的反动武装民团，在通向花县的道路上——象山脚两山环抱的地方设下埋伏来堵击我们，企图消灭这支残存的人民武装。我们冲破敌人的包围，打垮了敌人的埋伏，到傍晚，才退到花县城。这里反动派早已闻风逃之一空。
    听到从广州逃出来的人说，反革命正在那里大肆屠杀。广州市的街上布满了革命者的尸体。敌人就像得了“恐红病”，只要从哪家翻出了一条红布，一块红绸子，或者捉到一个说北方话的人，不问青红皂白，一概就地格杀勿论；甚至连穿红衣服的新娘子，也被推到火里烧了。但是，敌人的屠杀是吓不倒我们的，我们活着的人，决心继续战斗，不取得胜利誓不休止。
    十六号，我们在花县一个学校里，举行了党的会议，讨论部队的改编和今后的行动问题。撤到花县来的，共一千二百多人。改编一个军，人数太少；编一团，人又多了些。经过讨论，决定编一个师。可是，编第几师呢？大家都知道，南昌起义后，朱德同志在北江成立了红一师，海、陆丰有个红二师。
      “我们叫红三师吧！”有的同志提议说。
      “红三师也有了。”有的说：“琼崖的游击队已编为红三师了。”
    算来算去，四师的番号还没有。于是，我们自己命名为中国工农红军第四师。全师下编为十、十一、十二等三个团。师长叶镛，党代表袁裕（国平）政治部主任王侃如。我被任命为十团的党代表。
    第二个紧迫的问题是：花县离广州太近，又紧临铁路，不能停留太久，必须马上行动。到哪儿去呢？讨论了半天，决定去北江，找朱德同志率领的红一师会合。但他们在哪里，没人知道。我们一面整顿队伍，一面派侦探去打听。
    这时，花县的地主武装——民团，在城外日夜围攻我们。部队的供给也十分困难。我们派出打听消息的人员，一天、两天杳无音讯。等到第三天，再不能等了，我们估计，广州的敌人会很快追赶上来，那时再走就被动了。第三天又开了一个会，决定到海、陆丰找彭湃同志去，那里南靠大海，背靠大山，早已成立了苏维埃工农政府。
    晚上，我们打退了围城的民团，部队开始出发了。一路经过从化、良口、龙门、杭子坦，绕道兰口渡过了东江，并攻占了紫金县等地，打退了民团的数次袭扰。以后，在龙窝会见了海丰的赤卫队，阴历正月初一，我们到达了海丰县城。彭湃同志在这个地区领导过三次农民起义，前两次都失败了，第三次1927年11月1日占领了海丰城。并于11月7日正式成立了苏维埃政权。土地革命正进行的如火如荼，群众热情很高，到处是红旗招展。各村庄的墙壁上，写着“打倒土豪劣绅实行土地革命”的红字标语。群众听说我们是从广州下来的红军，热情万分，家家让房子，烧水做饭。虽然语言不通，但人们打着手势表示对红军的热爱。我们经过长途跋涉，真像回到自己的家一样。
    元月初二，在海丰城里的红场上，举行了几万人的群众大会，欢迎我们红四师。苏维埃主席彭湃同志在会上讲了话。他只有二十多岁，身材不高，脸长而白，完全像一个百分之百的文弱书生。他身穿普通的农民衣服，脚着一双草鞋。海、陆丰的农民都称他为“彭菩萨。”他宏亮的声音，革命的热情，坚强的意志，对革命的前途充满着必胜的信心，都使我们永怀不忘。当他讲到广州起义失败，他把手一挥说：“这算不了什么，虽然失败了，但我们是光荣的失败。我们共产党人，从来不计失败，不畏困难，失败了再干，跌倒爬起来，革命总有一天会成功的。”他那逻辑性很强、鼓动说服力很大、浅显易懂的讲话，句句打动听者的心坎，使人增加无限的勇气和毅力。
    不久，我们红四师和董朗同志率领的红二师会面了。两支年轻的部队，在彭湃同志的领导下，打了许多胜仗。我们红四师先后攻下陆丰城、甲子港，拔除了隔绝陆、普苏区联系的地主武装的最大据点——果陇，使陆丰与普宁的苏区联成一片。
    国民党军阀是不会让海、陆丰的苏维埃和平存在下去的，不久他们就开始了对海、陆丰苏区的“围剿”。黄旭初部从西面和北面向苏区围攻，占去了海、陆丰。陈铭枢部的新编十一师，也从福建开来，以惠城作据点，进攻惠、潮苏区。红四师开始虽打垮了该师的向卓然团，攻下了惠来，但终因敌人力量过大，不得不退入普宁的三坑山区与敌人周旋。
    当时，我们年轻的红军，只知道打仗攻城，不注重巩固根据地。经过多次战斗之后，部队的人数一天天缩小。敌人的“围剿”日益凶猛。他们到一处烧一处，到一村杀一村。凡是红军住过的房子，他们都烧掉；凡是与红军有过往来的人，他们抓住就活埋、杀死。我军为了保存最后的一部分武装，只好又从三坑撤退到海丰的大安洞、热水洞一带的山区里，配合当地的游击队打游击。
    人民永远和红军一条心。山外的青年、老人和妇女时常冒着生命的危险，往山上送粮食。有时粮食接济不上，战士们下河抓小鱼，到山坡上找野菜充饥。冬天，没有住的地点，自己割草盖房子；没有被子盖，便盖着稻草过夜。敌人每到山上“围剿”，一定把草房放火烧掉，可是等他们过去后，我们又盖起来。东山烧了西山盖，西山烧了南山盖。正像我们伟大的诗人白居易的诗句所写的“野火烧不尽，春风吹又生”。年轻的红军，在极端困难的情况下，斗争、生长。……
