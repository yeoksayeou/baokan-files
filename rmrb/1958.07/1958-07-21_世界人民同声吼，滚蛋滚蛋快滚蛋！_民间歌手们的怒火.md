The people of the world roar in unison, get out, get out, get out!
    ——The Fury of Folk Singers
    Iron Fist
    Fujian Folk Artist Wu Letian
    The Iraqi people's struggle is strong, unwilling to be oxen and horses for long. Overthrow the rule and break the shackles, achieve independence and freedom. Lebanese brothers also want to turn over, but U.S. imperialism intervenes by sending troops. People all over the world are angry, not allowing aggressors to run rampant. Demonstrations and marches are in crowds, with angry eyes and raised iron fists. Warning "Eisenhower," those who play with fire will burn themselves.
    Anger Spouts Out
    Hubei Zhang Yunxiang
    U.S. troops invade Lebanon, the people's anger spouts out! British troops break into Jordan, the protests shake the sky! Imperialists, get out, get out of Lebanon and Jordan, get out of Japan and the Philippines! Get out of Korea and Taiwan! The mountain of imperialism once oppressed the people for years, the old days are gone forever, the people want to change the world! The people are united and powerful, unafraid of moving mountains and overturning seas! The mountain of imperialism, the people will surely overthrow it!
    Lifting Mount Tai to Smash Eggs
    Shaanxi Farmer Wang Lao Jiu
    Hateful are the U.S. and British wolves, barging into the Middle East to mess things up, the Middle Eastern people are powerful, lifting Mount Tai to smash eggs. Unite to drive away the evil wolves, not allowing the flames of war to burn again, the people of the world roar in unison, get out, get out, get out!
  Give It Another Setback
        Sichuan Zhang Jilou
  Broad beans blossom with black hearts,
  U.S. and British robbers have wolfish hearts,
  Armed aggression against the Arabs,
  Wanting to swallow the Middle East in one gulp.
  A dog eating shit can't change its nature,
  Having suffered defeats, they still dare to come,
  The people of the Middle East are tightly united,
  Give it another setback.
  We are not afraid of paper tigers,
  The power of peace is greater than the sky,
  If robbers dare to set fire,
  They will surely burn their own homes.
  Stars in the sky shine on stars,
  People on earth love people,
  The people of the world are of one mind,
  Drive away the U.S. and British aggressors.
  Quickly Get Out of Lebanon
  Hubei Xishui County Farmer Zhang Qinghe
  U.S. and British interference in the Arab world,
  Before I even speak, anger arises,
  People all over the world know,
  Eisenhower has the heart of a jackal.
  Eisenhower has the heart of a jackal,
  Armed intervention in Lebanon,
  Even three-year-olds are indignant,
  Wanting you to quickly roll back home.
  Quickly roll back home,
  Destruction of peace is not allowed,
  We support the Arab world,
  The just struggle will surely win.
  The more I talk, the more fired up I get,
  The raging fire rushes to the ninth heaven,
  Melting the American paper tiger,
  The world will have eternal spring.
  Ultimately Digging Your Own Grave
    Sichuan Chengdu Shen Muyin
  The people of the Middle East want to turn over,
  Except for the tyrants, they make revolution,
  The people's awakening is powerful,
  Imperialism is afraid;
  Imperialism has gone mad,
  Daring to send troops to invade the Middle East,
  The Arabs rush up to meet them,
  Iron fists teach the aggressors a lesson!
  Peaceful people's hearts are linked,
  China supports Lebanon,
  Peaceful people unite,
  China supports Iraq!
  Warning the U.S. and British imperialists,
  Quickly withdraw your ships and soldiers,
  If you don't listen to good advice,
  You'll ultimately be digging your own grave!
  Beat the American Wolf to Death Alive
    Shanghai Worker Li Genbao
  The U.S. imperial wolf is in the lead,
  Dragging its tail, it crawls to Lebanon,
  The British fox also takes a risk,
  Baring its fangs and claws, it appears in the city of Jordan.
  The fox borrows the tiger's might to fake fierceness,
  A deathbed struggle to scare people,
  This group of jackals are fools,
  Not carefully considering in their hearts,
  The Eastern dragon stands up,
  Building a city of steel,
  Two point seven billion iron arms,
  Guarding the world's gate of peace.
  The people of Asia and Africa are powerful,
  Unafraid of jackals and leopards,
  Everyone raises their iron fists,
  Beat the American wolf to death alive!
  Six Hundred Million People Roar as One
  Hubei Huang Shengxiao
  The robber entered Lebanon,
  Can't steal things,
  Scattering thief-catching nets everywhere,
  Hard to escape the palm of peace.
  Ike, you have to settle the accounts,
  It's always you who suffer the loss!
  You get beaten every time you invade,
  Still want to turn over the old almanac!
  You suffered a defeat in Korea,
  It hasn't been long since then,
  Losing countless men and horses,
  The remnants and defeated generals cry for their mothers.
  The British and French invaded Egypt the year before last,
  You added fuel to the fire in vain,
  Causing the British and French to suffer,
  You didn't get any advantage either!
  This time invading Lebanon again,
  China firmly disagrees,
  Six hundred million people roar as one,
  The U.S. atom bomb won't work either.
  Don't Be Allowed to Bare Your Fangs and Claws Again
  Guangdong Jieyang Li Changsong
  A snake sheds its skin to pretend to be an eel,
  Can't hide a poisonous needle,
  The paper tiger has been blown to pieces by the east wind,
  Don't be allowed to bare your fangs and claws again.
  The peace-loving people of the whole world,
  Are our family,
  If the British and American troops don't get out, they will surely suffer the consequences.
  The East Wind Will Surely Extinguish the Flames of War
    Hubei He Daqun
  It is customary not to smash a broken jar,
  The U.S. imperialists are acting this way,
  Dreaming of ruling the whole world,
  Who knew they would always run into walls everywhere.
  Colonialism is going bankrupt,
  Hegemony and robbery are not going smoothly,
  Imperialism is shocked and afraid,
  The robbers immediately reveal their true colors.
  Frantically attacking Lebanon,
  Sending troops to bully Jordan,
  Clearly acting like robbers,
  Stubbornly saying it's to save overseas Chinese.
  Truly the dead want to come back to life,
  Truly the dead pig wants to crash into the wall,
  Suppressing Iraq's independence movement,
  Wanting to boost their own morale.
  There's a good old saying in China,
  Heroes love to fight injustice,
  The Chinese people uphold justice,
  We will never allow the U.S. imperialists to run rampant.
  We want you to get out of Lebanon,
  We want you to get out of the Philippines,
  Quickly withdraw your troops from Korea,
  Quickly return Taiwan to us!
  If you don't listen to these warnings,
  The angry east wind won't spare you,
  If six hundred million people get angry,
  You won't be able to survive.
  Imperialism can set fires,
  The east wind will surely extinguish the flames of war,
  The east wind will blow all over the world,
  The bleak west wind will enter hell!
  Brothers United, Bones are Hard
      Zhejiang Zhou Haijing
  From ancient times, mad dogs have been the most savage,
  It is even more unruly than a mad dog;
  Foxes have many insidious schemes,
  It has a more vicious face than a fox.
  The Arabs are our brothers,
  Brothers united, bones are hard;
  If the U.S. imperialists want to move half a hair,
  It's even more hopeless than trying to scoop the moon out of the well!
