    Moving Graves for Deep Burial to Expand Land and Increase Grain Production
    Liaoning Farmers Establish New Concepts of True Filial Piety and True Kindness
    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Hu Meizheng reports: During the mass rectification and the Great Leap Forward in production, the broad masses of farmers in Liaoning Province broke with the funeral customs that have been followed for thousands of years, implemented the moving of graves for deep burial, and expanded the cultivated land area. According to a survey and statistics from the Liaoning Provincial Agricultural Great Leap Forward Office, there are more than 8 million graves in the farmland of 51 cities and counties throughout the province, occupying nearly 1.2 million mu of land, accounting for 1.6% of the total cultivated land area. Fifteen cities and counties, including Gaiping, Andong, Kangping, and Yixian, have completely or basically leveled the graves in farmland, and other cities and counties have also leveled about 20%. Nearly 2 million graves have been moved (accounting for 25% of the total number of graves). The remains that were exhumed were, according to the wishes of the deceased's family, mostly buried deeply on the spot (about five feet deep), and a small portion was moved to public cemeteries jointly selected by the masses. As a result, the province expanded its cultivated land by 330,000 mu. If calculated at a minimum grain production of 270 jin per mu, a total of more than 89.00 million jin of grain can be increased. At the same time, the masses have been liberated from the old customs and old ideas of thousands of years and have established new concepts of "developing production to comfort the elderly during their lifetime is true filial piety; doing a good job in socialist construction to benefit future generations is true kindness." A new funeral system of replacing ancestral graves with public cemeteries and replacing shallow burial with raised mounds with flat deep burial has begun to form a new trend throughout the province.
    This mass movement in Liaoning Province to reform the old habits of thousands of years is being carried out on the basis of the continuous improvement of the socialist ideological consciousness of the broad masses of farmers. The broad masses, especially the elderly, have undergone the promotion of socialist education, the mass rectification movement, and the ensuing high tide of socialist production and construction since last year, and their minds have been greatly liberated. In the words of the masses themselves, "All thoughts are unified, and we wholeheartedly believe in the Party, for the collective, and for socialism." Everything else can be discarded. Encouraged by the publication of the National Agricultural Development Program and the leap forward plan proposed by the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee to work hard for three years to change the province's production outlook, farmers in many areas, when studying and formulating production leap forward plans, felt that the mounds scattered in the fields hindered mechanized farming and the development of production. Therefore, the masses launched discussions on the issue of reforming the funeral system. During the discussion, the masses in various places unanimously put forward the slogan "Move graves for deep burial, make way for tractors, expand land and increase grain production." The elderly explained from the present and ancient times that burying graves and erecting monuments is originally a commemoration of predecessors by later generations, but occupying land and reducing grain production is not the wish of predecessors. When people die, it is like a lamp going out, and they know nothing. Many elderly people took the lead in implementing the moving of graves for deep burial, which greatly educated and encouraged the young and middle-aged people.

### 移坟深葬扩地增粮  辽宁农民树立了真孝真慈的新观念

    移坟深葬扩地增粮
    辽宁农民树立了真孝真慈的新观念
    本报讯　记者胡枚正报道：辽宁省广大农民在全民整风和生产大跃进中，打破了沿习几千年的殡葬习俗，实行移坟深葬，扩大了耕地面积。据辽宁省农业大跃进办公室调查统计，全省五十一个市、县的农田中，共有八百多万座坟墓，占地近一百二十万亩，为总耕地面积的1.6％。盖平、安东、康平、义县等十五个县市已全部或基本迁平了农田中的坟墓，其它市县也迁平了20％左右。迁平坟墓近二百万座（占总坆数的25％）。起出的遗骨，根据墓主的自愿，绝大部分就地平埋深葬（五尺左右），一小部分迁移到由群众共同选定的公墓地里。全省因此扩大耕地三十三万亩，如按每亩最低生产粮食二百七十斤计算，共可增产八千九百多万斤粮食。同时，群众从几千年的旧习俗、旧思想中解放出来，树立了“发展生产慰养老人于生前是真孝；搞好社会主义建设造福子孙万代为真慈”的新观念，以公墓代祖茔，以平埋深葬代浅埋起顶的新殡葬制度，已在全省各地开始形成新的风气。
    辽宁省这种改革几千年来旧习的群众性运动，是在广大农民的社会主义思想觉悟不断提高的基础上进行的。广大群众　　特别是老年人，经受了去年以来的社会主义教育、全民整风运动以及随之而来的社会主义生产建设高潮的推动，思想来了个大解放，照群众自己的话来说就是：“万念为一，一心相信党、为集体、奔社会主义”，别的什么都可丢开。全国农业发展纲要的公布和辽宁省委提出的苦战三年，改变全省生产面貌的跃进规划的鼓舞下，很多地区农民在研究制定生产跃进规划时，都感到散布在田野上的坟丘妨碍机耕和发展生产，于是群众纷纷就改革殡葬制度问题展开了讨论。在讨论中，各地群众不约而同地提出了“移坟深葬，给拖拉机让道，扩地增粮”的口号。老年人则讲今论古地说明：埋坟立碑本是后人对前人的纪念，但是占地少打粮却不是前人心愿，人死如灯灭，什么也不知。许多老人并带头实行移坟深葬，对青壮年的教育和鼓舞很大。
