Rich and varied military summer camp activities have been launched in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places.

This summer, young workers and students in various places are enthusiastically participating in military summer camp activities. Beijing originally planned to organize 50,000 people to participate in summer camp activities, but by June 30, the number of applicants had reached more than 80,000. Shandong Province will have 500,000 people participating in various military camping activities this year.

In order to meet the requirements of different participants as much as possible, the organization of this year's military summer camps has adopted various forms. One is the day camp. This is held for young workers and takes place during factory rest days. The activities include assembly, marching, visits, lectures, etc. Another is the week-long camp. This is mainly aimed at university, college, and high school students. Students go to military camps in batches to spend seven to eight days of military life, focusing on learning to shoot, and requiring 30% of them to reach the standard of ordinary shooters. In addition, they will also participate in two days of physical labor. Another is the three-day camp. The participants are mainly junior high school students, and the activities include aviation, naval models, military lectures, etc.

People's Liberation Army units in various places are vigorously supporting military summer camp activities. They send officers to serve as instructors, provide equipment and venues, and prepare to perform military demonstrations for the summer camps. An air force unit in Shanghai is preparing to receive 15,000 young workers and students this summer. They held a special meeting to arrange the preparations. An amateur performance team rehearsed programs, preparing to perform for the summer camp. (Li) (with picture)

    本报讯　丰富多采的军事夏令营活动，已在北京、上海等地展开。
    今夏各地参加军事夏令营活动的青年工人和学生非常踊跃。北京市原来打算组织五万人参加夏令营活动，到6月30日止，报名人数已达八万多人。山东省将有五十万人参加今年的各种军事野营活动。
    为了尽量适合不同对象的要求，今年的军事夏令营的组织，采取了多种形式。一种是日营。这是为青年职工们举办的，利用工厂休息日进行。活动内容有集合、行军、参观、讲座等等。另外是周营。它是以大学、专科、高中学生为主要对象。学生们分批到军营过七至八天军事生活，以学习射击为主，要求30％的人达到普通射手的标准。此外，他们还要参加两天体力劳动。再一种是三日营。参加者主要是初中学生，活动内容有航空、航海模型、军事讲座等。
    各地人民解放军都大力支援军事夏令营活动。他们派出军官担任教练、提供器材、场地，并准备为夏令营进行军事表演。上海空军某部，今夏准备接待一万五千名青年工人和学生。他们专门召开了会议，安排了准备工作。业余演出队排演了节目，准备给夏令营演出。（里）（附图片）
