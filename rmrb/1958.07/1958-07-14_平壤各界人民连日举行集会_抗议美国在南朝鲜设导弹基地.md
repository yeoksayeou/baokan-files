Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 13th: Over a hundred factories, schools, and organizations of workers, students, and citizens in Pyongyang City held rallies yesterday and today to protest the provocative actions of the American aggressors in establishing missile bases in South Korea.

    More than a thousand employees of the Daesung Pottery Factory held a rally on the evening of the 12th. The employees shouted angrily, "Resolutely oppose the American aggressors establishing missile bases in South Korea" and "U.S. troops get out of South Korea!"
    Worker Zhang Shixing of this factory said at the meeting that just as the Chinese People's Volunteers have begun the second phase of troop withdrawals from Korea, the American imperialists are frantically establishing missile bases in Western Europe, the Middle East, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, which proves that the United States is intensifying its pursuit of a war policy.
    Zhang Shixing emphasized that the American aggressors are once again treating the Korean people's will for peaceful reunification of their country with serious provocative actions, but the Korean people love their country and have the strength to defend their national honor, and no force can subdue the Korean people.
    Residents of Changtian-dong in Pyongyang City held a protest rally today. Housewife Li Dehui said at the meeting, we must not tolerate the provocative crimes of these murderous devils. She said that as long as the American aggressor troops occupy South Korea, the threat of an atomic war in Korea cannot be eliminated, nor can a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue be achieved.
    The participants unanimously expressed that they would use practical actions to make the American aggressors get out of South Korea.

    平壤各界人民连日举行集会
    抗议美国在南朝鲜设导弹基地
    新华社平壤13日电　平壤市一百多个工厂、学校、机关的职工、学生和市民在昨天和今天举行集会，抗议美国侵略者在南朝鲜建立导弹基地的挑衅行为。
    大成窑业工厂的一千多名职工，12日晚上举行了集会。职工们愤怒地高呼着“坚决反对美国侵略者在南朝鲜建立导弹基地”和“美军滚出南朝鲜去”等口号。
    这个工厂的工人张时兴在大会上讲话说，正当中国人民志愿军已经开始从朝鲜第二批撤军的时候，美帝国主义者却在西欧、中近东、日本和台湾以及在南朝鲜疯狂地建立导弹基地，这证明美国变本加厉地奉行战争政策。
    张时兴强调说，美国侵略者又一次用严重的挑衅行动来对待朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的意志，但是，朝鲜人民热爱祖国，并且有力量维护民族荣誉，没有任何力量能够使朝鲜人民屈服。
    平壤市仓田洞的居民今天举行了抗议集会。家庭妇女李德辉在会上说，我们决不能容忍杀人魔鬼的挑衅罪行。她说，只要美国侵略军占领着南朝鲜，就不能消除在朝鲜引起原子战争的威胁，也不能实现朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    与会者一致表示，要用实际行动使美国侵略者从南朝鲜滚出去。
