Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th July: More than 250,000 mu of wheat in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, has been harvested. After repeated calculations, the average yield per mu reached 620 jin. This is the highest record for large-area wheat abundance nationwide by a county so far. Last year, Gucheng County had the highest wheat yield in Hubei Province and was one of the well-known high-yield wheat counties in the country. However, this year's average wheat yield per mu has increased by more than one to two times compared to last year, and the total output has increased even more. This year, Gucheng County's wheat has achieved abundance in mountainous, hilly, and plain areas, and a large number of high-yield and large-area abundance examples have emerged on various types of soil. According to statistics, the county has a total of 34,130 mu with yields of 1,000 to 2,600 jin per mu, and more than 48 mu with yields of 2,600 to more than 5,000 jin, with the highest yield being 5,467 jin per mu. One district in the county has an average yield of 1,003 jin per mu; nine townships have an average yield of 1,000 to 1,525 jin per mu; 75 cooperatives have an average yield of 1,000 to 1,500 jin or more, including the Yongxin Cooperative in Zhangwan Township with an average yield of 2,000 jin per mu; and a total of 279 production teams in the county have an average yield of 1,000 to 2,000 jin or more.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 17th July: Mengjin Agricultural Cooperative in Xiping County, Henan, harvested 12,393 jin of wheat from 1 mu, 7 fen, 2 li, and 1 hao of land, averaging 7,201 jin per mu.

	This high-yield wheat plot was primarily managed by cooperative leader Liu Dazhen, deputy leader Li Zhenhua, and ninth team leader Liu Lingqi, with members Liu Fuan, Li Mei, Jiao Guiying, Yang Guilian, and others regularly participating in management. During the wheat harvest, eleven strong laborers began cutting at four in the morning and continued until twelve in the afternoon. The next day, twenty-four people carried the wheat to the threshing ground using shoulder poles, and it took them a full nine and a half hours to transport it, even though there were only two small plots of land in between. During threshing, the first round was done in two batches: the first batch yielded 39 bags, totaling 4,780 jin, and the second batch yielded 53 bags, totaling 6,360 jin. The second round yielded 1,117 jin. The third round yielded another 178 jin. The wheat chaff from the fourth round also yielded 218 jin. The total weight of the uncleaned wheat was 12,653 jin, which, after drying and cleaning, amounted to 12,393 jin.

	Zhang Baocai, a cadre stationed in the cooperative, and Ji Laihai, the tenth team leader, and Li Tianshen, the eighth team leader, were all present during the wheat cutting and threshing. Later, Xu Gengjie, Deputy Secretary of the Xiping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Wang Binglin, Deputy Director of the Prefectural Committee Office, and others came to the cooperative to verify the yield.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 17th July: Xiaoliuhe Production Team of Suiying Agricultural Cooperative in Dusi Township, Deng County, Henan, achieved a yield of 6,541 jin per mu from 1 mu and 4 fen and 9 li of wheat. This high-yield plot was cultivated by production team leader Liu Zhensheng, livestock group leader Lu Zhongmin, technician Liu Fuju, and the Youth Shock Brigade.

	The wheat grew so densely that no soil was visible. Cui Zhengjie of Suiying Village encountered a rabbit running into this high-yield field; the rabbit darted in but was blocked by the wheat stalks and could not advance, so he caught it. Cooperative member Liu Jianming broke two sickles while cutting the wheat with a Hubei-style wide sickle. The entire team selected twelve young and strong shock workers who worked for an entire day to cut seventeen large carts of wheat. The Deng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently sent people to investigate and verify the yield.

    谷城创小麦大面积丰产最高纪录
    西平县猛进社亩产7201斤　邓县岁营社亩产6541斤
    据新华社武汉16日电　湖北省谷城县的二十五万多亩小麦已全部打完，经过反复核算，平均亩产量达到六百二十斤。以县为单位来说，这是截至目前止全国小麦大面积丰产的最高纪录。去年，谷城县是湖北省小麦产量最高的县，也是全国有名的小麦高产县之一。但是，它今年的小麦平均亩产量比去年又提高了一、二倍以上，总产量则提高得更多些。今年谷城县的小麦无论是在山区、丘陵区或平原区都获得了丰产，而且在各类不同土质的土地上都涌现了大批高额丰产和大面积丰产的典型。据统计，全县亩产一千斤到二千六百斤的总共有三万四千一百三十亩，亩产二千六百斤以上到五千多斤的有四十八亩多，其中最高的亩产五千四百六十七斤。全县有一个区平均亩产一千零三斤；有九个乡平均亩产一千斤到一千五百二十五斤；平均亩产一千斤到一千五百斤以上的社共有七十五个，其中张弯乡永新社平均亩产二千斤；平均亩产一千斤到二千斤以上的生产队，全县共二百七十九个。
    新华社郑州17日电　河南西平县猛进农业社一亩七分二厘一毫小麦，收一万二千三百九十三斤，平均亩产七千二百零一斤。
    这块小麦丰产地是以社长刘大振、副社长李振华、九队队长刘令起为主搞的试验田，并有社员刘富安、李梅、焦桂英、杨桂莲等人经常参加管理。收麦时，十一个壮劳动力从早晨四点起，一直割到上午十二点才割完。第二天，二十四个人，用杠子抬着往场内运麦，中间只相隔两块并不大的地，就整整运了九个半钟头。打场时，第一遍打了两场：头一场打了三十九布袋，计四千七百八十斤，第二场打了五十三布袋，计六千三百六十斤。第二遍打了一场，收了一千一百一十七斤。第三遍又收了一百七十八斤。第四遍打的麦糠，还收了二百一十八斤。总计打毛麦一万二千六百五十三斤，后经晒干扬净，共有一万二千三百九十三斤。
    割麦、打场的时候，驻社干部张保才，十队队长姬赖孩，八队队长李天身都在场。后来，中共西平县委副书记徐庚杰、地委办公室副主任王秉林等来到这个社进行了验收。
    新华社郑州17日电　河南邓县都司乡岁营农业社小河流生产队一亩四分九厘小麦，亩产六千五百四十一斤。这块丰产地是生产队长刘振生、饲养组长卢中敏、技术员刘付举和青年突击组种的。
    这块麦子长的撒土不漏；岁营村崔正杰碰见个兔子往这块丰产地跑，兔子窜进去被麦秆挡住不能前进，被他捉住了。社员刘建明用湖北宽镰砍麦子，就砍坏了两张镰刀。全队挑选了十二个年轻力壮的突击手，整整干了一天，割了十七大车，中共邓县委员会最近派人前往调查，核实了产量。
