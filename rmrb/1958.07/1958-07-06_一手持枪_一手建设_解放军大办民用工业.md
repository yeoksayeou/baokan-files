Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army is vigorously developing civilian industries, adding brilliance to the motherland's socialist industrial construction. Their bold slogan is: "Hold a gun in one hand and engage in construction in the other; be heroes defending socialism, and be vanguards of the technological revolution."

Building steel plants, constructing blast furnaces, and manufacturing machines have become fairly common actions among troops in various locations. Since the Lanzhou Military Region's automobile repair plant successfully trial-produced tractors and small locomotives in June, and refined high-speed tool steel and medium carbon steel, it has added steelmaking, ironmaking, and tractor manufacturing workshops with the assistance of the logistics department. In less than a month, this ordinary repair plant has transformed into a smelting and manufacturing factory. Steelmaking alone is expected to produce 50 to 60 tons of steel this year. After a ship repair plant of a certain unit on the Fujian front line refined high-carbon steel using "native furnaces" in mid-June, a unit stationed in the Lianjiang area basically built an ironmaking plant with a daily output of six tons of pig iron within three days. According to the opinions of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hubei Military Region is using funds lent by the local government to build an "August 1st" iron and steel joint factory with an annual output of 1 million to 1.2 million tons of steel.

The repair and assembly plants of various arms of the military are working vigorously to trial-produce various new civilian products. The Jinan Military Region's automobile repair plant worked hard for fifteen days and nights and has trial-produced the "Surpass England Style" universal tractor, the "Leap Forward Brand" tricycle motorcycle, as well as small generators and power machines, all-gear lathes, and magnetic surface grinders. Under the principle of "trial production and production simultaneously," two factories of the Navy requested production tasks from the government. Currently, ten provinces and cities including Jiangsu, Hunan, and Sichuan have ordered dozens of types of metallurgical equipment, machine tools, sugar manufacturing machines, and fishing vessels from these two factories. Workers and technicians in these two factories are trial-producing new products required by the ordering units day and night with soaring enthusiasm and a spirit of perseverance. Many of these items have been successfully trial-produced and put into production, and some have begun to be delivered. The small locomotive manufactured by the Lanzhou Military Region's automobile repair plant, which can carry more than 30 tons and travel at a speed of more than 30 kilometers per hour, is running on the people-run small railway in Weiyuan County, Gansu, and the local people affectionately call it the "PLA Locomotive."

    一手持枪　一手建设
    解放军大办民用工业
    据新华社4日讯　中国人民解放军大搞民用工业，为祖国社会主义工业建设锦上添花。他们豪迈的口号是：“一手持枪，一手建设；做保卫社会主义的英雄，当技术革命的尖兵”。
    办钢厂、建高炉、造机器，已成为各地部队相当普遍的行动。兰州部队汽车修理厂，自从6月份试制成功拖拉机、小火车头，炼出高速工具钢、中碳钢等以后，又在后勤部门协助下，增设了炼钢、炼铁车间和拖拉机制造车间。不到一个月，这个普通的修理厂就变成了冶炼、制造工厂，仅炼钢一项，今年就可以生产五十到六十吨钢。福建前线部队某修船厂6月中旬用“土炉子”炼出高碳钢以后，驻连江地区的一支部队在三天之内基本建成了一个日产生铁六吨的炼铁厂。湖北军区根据中共湖北省委的意见，用地方贷给的资金，正在兴建一座年产钢铁一百万到一百二十万吨的“八一”钢铁联合工厂。
    各兵种部队的修配工厂正在干劲十足地试制各种民用新产品。济南部队的汽车修理厂苦战十五昼夜，已经试制出“超英式”万能拖拉机，“跃进牌”三轮摩托车，以及小型发电机和动力机、全齿轮车床和磁力平面磨床等。海军部队的两个工厂在“边试制、边生产”的方针下，向政府请求了生产任务。现在江苏、湖南、四川等十个省市向这两个厂订购的冶金设备、机床、制糖机、渔轮等已达数十种。这两个工厂的工人和技术人员正以冲天的干劲和钻劲，昼夜试制订货单位所要求的新产品，其中许多项已试制成功投入生产，有的开始交货。兰州部队汽车修理厂制造的小火车头，能载重三十多吨、时速三十多公里，正在甘肃渭源县民办的小铁路上奔驰，当地人民亲昵地称它为“解放军火车头”。
