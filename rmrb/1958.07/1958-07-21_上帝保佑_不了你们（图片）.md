    “God Bless” Can't Help You
    This is a group of American invading troops from Adana, Turkey, about to be airlifted to Lebanon. Before their departure, they knelt down, praying to God for blessings. In fact, those who play with fire will get burned. If the U.S. and British imperialists do not immediately cease their insane acts of aggression, they will inevitably end in a shameful defeat. God cannot bless them.

    “上帝保佑”不了你们
    这是一批由土耳其亚达那即将空运到黎巴嫩去的美国侵略军。他们在出发前，双膝跪地，祈求上帝保佑。其实，玩火者必自焚，美英帝国主义如不立即停止他们疯狂的侵略行为，必然以可耻的失败告终。上帝是保佑不了他们的。
