    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 7th. Cairo's "Evening News" published an article on July 7th commenting on the anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda campaign launched by the West regarding the execution of the counter-revolutionary Nagy in Hungary. The article stated that Egypt, in particular, should not forget that one of the purposes of the West in instigating the Hungarian incident in 1956 was to facilitate the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt.

    The author of the article said that Nagy was one of the figures who planned the 1956 Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots and attempted to open the door of Hungary to the West. He formally requested Western armed intervention in Hungary in November of that year.

    He said that we cannot discuss the Nagy issue with an emotional attitude because it is a political issue. No one has the right to shed a tear for Nagy, and no one has the right to forget that thousands of people died in Hungary due to his actions.

    The author of the article condemned the West for launching this propaganda campaign in order to obstruct the convening of a summit conference and peace talks, and he urged people not to be influenced by this propaganda.

    谴责西方为纳吉伏法叫嚷
    新华社开罗7日电  开罗“晚报”7月7日载文评论西方就匈牙利处决反革命分子纳吉而发动的反苏反共宣传运动说，埃及特别不应当忘记，西方在1956年挑起匈牙利事件的目的之一就是为了便利英法以三国侵略埃及。
    文章作者说，纳吉是策划1956年匈牙利反革命暴乱和试图给西方敞开匈牙利大门的人物之一，他曾经在那一年的11月里正式要求西方武装干涉匈牙利。
    他说，我们不能用感情用事的态度来讨论纳吉的问题，因为这是政治问题，谁也没有权利为纳吉洒一滴眼泪，没有权利忘记由于他的行为在匈牙利有数以千计的人死亡。
    文章作者谴责西方目前为了阻碍召开最高级会议和和平会谈而发动这个宣传运动，他要求人们不要受这种宣传的影响。
