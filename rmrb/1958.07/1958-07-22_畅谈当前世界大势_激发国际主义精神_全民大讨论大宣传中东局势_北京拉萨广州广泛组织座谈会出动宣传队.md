    Discuss the Current World Situation and Inspire Internationalism
    Nationwide Discussion and Promotion of the Middle East Situation
    Beijing, Lhasa, and Guangzhou Widely Organize Symposiums and Dispatch Propaganda Teams
    Beijing
    Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: People from all walks of life in Beijing's urban and rural areas are continuing to conduct a nationwide discussion on the Middle East situation caused by the US-British imperialist aggression.
    According to relevant statistics, the workers of forty large state-owned enterprises are continuing to discuss the current situation today, and the discussion has gradually begun to deepen. The vast majority of farmers in more than 1,600 agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs have held situation discussion meetings by village, cooperative, and team. Residents of Xuanwu District held more than 700 forums on the 20th, and residents and workers of 18 street offices, 100 small and medium-sized factories, and 136 handicraft production cooperatives in Chongwen District generally conducted discussions.
    The working class in the capital is extremely concerned about the situation in the Middle East. Many people gather together to discuss the situation in the Middle East after work. Zhang Zhenyu, an old worker in the tool workshop of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, said at the discussion meeting: We Chinese have tasted the pain of imperialist oppression. Now we have driven away the imperialists and our strength has also increased. Now, the US and British imperialists are trying to oppress our Arab brothers and make them continue to live the lives we used to live. We must take care of this matter. Wang Qilin, a seventy-four-year-old retired worker from the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, said at the discussion meeting based on his decades of personal experience: Peaceful life has always been achieved after fighting reactionary forces. Today, imperialism is creating the danger of war in the Middle East again, and we must rise up and fight them.
    Through discussion, the working class in the capital clearly recognizes that the powerful 600 million Chinese people bear an important responsibility for the cause of opposing aggression and defending world peace. To this end, they are determined to create excellent achievements in production to enhance the strength of the motherland. The Beijing Cotton Textile United Factory started a "Support Arab People's Struggle Week" on the 20th, with a focus on increasing production, improving quality, and strengthening current affairs publicity. All workshops in the factory were plastered with slogans such as "Express determination with action and turn anger into strength." The workers of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory put forward the slogan "Treat the factory as a battlefield" in the discussion. They are determined to work hard for seventy days and complete the national production plan, which is three times higher than last year, three months in advance.
    The farmers in the capital also showed a strong sense of shared hatred against the imperialist aggression suffered by the Arab people. Yin Weichen, a representative of the National People's Congress and a famous agricultural labor model, said at the discussion meeting that when he heard about the US and British imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, he thought of the years when we were subjected to Japanese imperialist aggression. At that time, we lived a life of oppression that was inferior to that of cattle and horses. Today, the US and British imperialists are trying to impose the crimes we have suffered on the Arab people. How can we allow them to act so recklessly?
    The 80,000 teachers and students of universities and colleges in the capital have conducted extensive and in-depth discussions on the Middle East situation in recent days. During the discussion, everyone criticized the phenomenon that some teachers and students were simply burying themselves in their work and not paying enough attention to the international political situation.
    The nationwide discussion on the Middle East and world situation by people from all walks of life in Beijing will continue to deepen.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: From the 19th to the 21st, the cultural and artistic circles, workers, students, and cadres in Beijing formed tens of thousands of propaganda teams to carry out extensive publicity activities on the Middle East and world situation among residents.
    Today, on both sides of the city's main streets, there is an eye-catching large-scale propaganda mural every ten meters. This is a collective creation of teachers and staff from more than a dozen units including the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing Fine Arts Company, Fine Arts Publishing House, and Chinese Painting Academy.
    As the scorching sun just set in the west, at Tiananmen Square, Dongdan Square, and Qianmen Street, there was a living drama performance every two or three miles. The actors of the China Peking Opera Theater, dressed in Arab national costumes, performed "Cut off the Aggressors' Black Hands" in Peking Opera tunes to the sound of gongs and drums, praising the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people to overthrow the feudal dynasty and establish a republic. After watching the play, more than 3,000 spectators cheered enthusiastically and continuously for the revolutionary victory of the Iraqi people.
    Workers, teachers, students, and government cadres are the main force of this propaganda activity. In more than 40 major large state-owned factories and mines, workers from more than 30 factories and mines organized propaganda teams to carry out publicity in their families and nearby towns. Now, residents are particularly concerned about current affairs, and the sales volume of Beijing newspapers has increased from the usual 500,000 copies per day to more than 780,000 copies.
    Lhasa
    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 21st: More than 1,000 representatives from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Lhasa held a conference this afternoon to strongly protest the heinous activities of US and British imperialism's armed aggression against the Middle East.
    General Zhang Jingwu, Representative of the Central People's Government in Xizang and Secretary of the Xizang Working Committee of the CPC, spoke at the meeting. He used the historical facts of the Chinese People's War of Liberation and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to illustrate that US imperialism is just a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak inside. He said that people of all ethnic groups in the Xizang region are determined to join the people of the whole country in opposing all acts of aggression by US and British imperialism in the Middle East.
    The meeting read out written speeches by the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni. In their speeches, they severely condemned the US and British imperialist armed aggression in the Middle East as undermining peace and creating war, and on behalf of the people of Xizang, they expressed their full support for the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of Lebanon and Iraq and the national independence movements of the Arab countries. In his written speech, the Dalai Lama also called on everyone to be vigilant while opposing imperialist aggression in the Middle East, and to strictly guard against imperialist elements, agents of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, and a small number of reactionary elements within Xizang who are plotting to subvert and split activities in Xizang.
    Guangzhou
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 21st: Six hundred thousand people in Guangzhou held demonstrations in the sweltering heat today to resolutely protest the crimes of US and British imperialist aggression against the Middle East.
    "Turn the factory into a battlefield" and "Use practical actions to step up production to support the struggle to defend peace" were the loudest slogans of the workers' demonstration today. The workers of the Zhongyi Cigarette Factory proposed to strive to build a steelmaking workshop before August 1st and use molten steel to burn the heads of the aggressors. The person in charge of the Huangpu Port Trade Union today represented the demonstrators in expressing to the captain of the British ship West Wind, which was berthed in Huangpu Port, the Chinese people's determination to defend peace, and asked him to convey it to the British people.
    The peasant brothers who had just welcomed the bumper harvest today also gathered in front of the monument to the martyrs of the Pingying Group, who opposed British imperialism, holding the banner of the Pingying Group from more than a hundred years ago and holding the indigenous guns and cannons of the Pingying Group. They solemnly swore an oath in front of the martyrs' monument, saying that they were ready to contribute to the fight against imperialist aggression at any time.
    More than 20,000 residents on the Pearl River today gathered on the Jiangmian and roads of Xidi-Shamian in two ways, by water and land, and held protest meetings and demonstrations in front of the monument to the martyrs who sacrificed in the 1925 June 23rd struggle against British and other imperialist aggression in Shaqi, which stands on the Jiangbin.
    In recent days, the people of Guangzhou have held conferences, small forums, and report meetings, and used various propaganda weapons to deeply expose the crimes of US and British imperialist aggression.

    北京
    据新华社21日讯  北京城乡各界人民正在就美英帝国主义侵略中东和由此所引起的局势继续进行全民大讨论。
    据有关方面统计，有四十个大型国营企业的职工今天正在继续讨论当前局势，讨论已逐步开始深入。郊区一千六百多个农业生产合作社的绝大部分农民都分别按村、社、队举行了局势讨论会。宣武区居民20日举行了七百多个座谈会，崇文区十八个街道办事处、一百个中小工厂、一百三十六个手工业生产合作社的居民和职工都普遍进行了讨论。
    首都的工人对中东的局势极为关心。许多人在下班后就聚集在一起讨论中东局势。北京农业机械厂工具车间老工人张振宇在讨论会上说：我们中国人尝尽了帝国主义压迫的痛苦，现在我们把帝国主义赶跑了，力量也大了。眼下美、英帝国主义妄想压迫阿拉伯弟兄，要他们继续过我们过去的生活，这件事我们一定要管。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂七十四岁的退休老工人王起林根据他几十年的亲身经历，在讨论会上说：和平生活从来都是在向反动势力作斗争后取得的。今天，帝国主义又在中东制造战争危险，我们必须起来跟他们斗争。
    通过讨论，首都的工人阶级清楚地认识到，强大的六亿中国人民对反对侵略保卫世界和平的事业担负着重要的责任。为此，他们决心要在生产上创造优异的成绩，来增强祖国的力量。北京棉纺织联合厂20日开始了一个以提高产量、质量加强时事宣传的学习为中心的“支援阿拉伯人民斗争周”。全厂各个车间贴满了“用行动表决心，化愤怒为力量”的标语。北京农业机械厂的职工在讨论中提出了“把工厂当战场”的口号，他们决心苦战七十天，把比去年提高三倍的国家生产计划，提前三个月完成。
    首都的农民对阿拉伯人民遭受到帝国主义侵略也表现了强烈的同仇敌忾的气概。全国人民代表大会代表、著名农业劳动模范殷维臣在讨论会上说，一听美、英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，就想起了我们受日本帝国主义侵略的年代，那时我们过着被压迫的牛马不如的生活，今天美英帝国主义企图把我们受过的罪强加给阿拉伯人民，怎么能允许他们这样横行？
    首都高等学校八万师生连日对中东形势进行了广泛和深入的讨论。讨论中大家批判了一部分师生单纯埋头业务对国际政治形势关心不够的现象。
    北京各界人民对中东和世界局势的全民大讨论将继续深入进行。
    据新华社21日讯  从19日到21日，北京的文化艺术界和工人、学生、干部组成了上万个宣传队，就中东和世界局势问题在居民中展开了广泛的宣传活动。
    今天，全市各个主要街道的两侧，平均每隔十公尺距离就有一幅引人注目的大幅宣传壁画。这是中央美术学院、北京市美术公司、美术出版社、国画院等十多个单位的师生和工作人员的集体创作。
    灼热的太阳刚刚西坠，在天安门广场、东单广场和前门大街等处，每隔二三里路就有一场活报剧在演出。中国京剧院的演员穿着阿拉伯民族的服装，在锣鼓声中用京剧唱腔演出了“切断侵略者的黑手”，歌颂伊拉克人民推翻封建王朝建立共和国的英勇斗争。三千多观众看完这个剧后热烈地为伊拉克人民的革命胜利而经久不息地欢呼。
    工人、教师、学生、机关干部是这个宣传活动的主力军。在四十多个主要的大型国营厂矿里，有三十多个厂矿的工人组织了宣传队在家属和附近的乡镇中进行了宣传。现在，居民对时事特别关心，北京各报的销售量已由往常每天销五十万份增加到七十八万多份。拉  萨
    据新华社拉萨21日电  拉萨市各族各界代表一千多人今天下午举行大会，强烈抗议美、英帝国主义武装侵略中东的罪恶活动。
    中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武将军在大会上讲了话，他通过中国人民解放战争和抗美援朝战争的历史事实，说明美帝国主义不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎。他表示西藏地区各族人民坚决同全国人民一起，反对美英帝国主义在中东的一切侵略活动。
    大会宣读了达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的书面讲话。他们在讲话中严厉斥责美英帝国主义在中东的武装侵略活动是在破坏和平、制造战争，并且代表全西藏人民表示：全力支持黎巴嫩和伊拉克人民的反帝斗争以及阿拉伯各国人民的民族独立运动。达赖喇嘛在书面讲话中还号召大家，在反对帝国主义在中东的侵略活动的同时，要提高警惕，严防帝国主义分子、蒋介石集团的特务分子和西藏内部的一小撮反动分子阴谋在西藏策动颠复和分裂活动。
    广州
    据新华社广州21日电  广州市今天有六十万人在酷暑中举行示威游行，坚决抗议美英帝国主义侵略中东的罪行。
    “把工厂变作战场”“用加紧生产的实际行动来支援保卫和平的斗争”是今天工人示威队伍中最响亮的口号。中一烟厂的工人们提出要争取在八一前建成炼钢车间，用钢水浇焦侵略者的脑袋。黄埔港港务工会的负责人今天代表示威群众向湾泊在黄埔港的英国船西风号的船长，当面表示了中国人民保卫和平的决心，并请他转达给英国人民。
    刚刚迎接过丰收的农民兄弟们今天也集中在纪念反对英帝国主义的平英团烈士碑前，举着一百多年前平英团的旗号，拿着平英团的土枪土炮，在烈士碑前庄严宣誓，他们表示随时准备为反对帝国主义侵略贡献力量。
    珠江水上的两万多居民，今天分成水陆两路集结在西堤——沙面的江面上、马路上，在矗立在江滨的1925年6月23日在沙基反对英国等帝国主义侵略的斗争中牺牲的烈士碑前，举行抗议大会和示威游行。
    广州市人民连日举行了大会、小型座谈会、报告会，并运用各种宣传武器，深入地揭露美英帝国主义的侵略罪行。
