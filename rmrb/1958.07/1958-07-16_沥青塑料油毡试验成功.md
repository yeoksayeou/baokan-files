    Successful Experiment with Asphalt Plastic Roofing Felt
    Engineer Zhang Yingjiu of Tianjin Roofing Felt Factory, with the assistance of technician Zhuang Jinsheng of Shenyang Roofing Felt Factory, has successfully experimented with asphalt plastic roofing felt, which has not been produced anywhere in the world. According to preliminary assessment, this asphalt plastic roofing felt does not become sticky or gluey at 140 degrees Celsius, and does not break or crack at minus 29 degrees Celsius; its waterproof performance is more than twice that of ordinary roofing felt, and its service life is also longer than that of ordinary roofing felt. The successful trial production of asphalt plastic roofing felt can not only meet the urgent needs of capital construction for waterproof building materials, but also represents a major technological reform in the manufacturing industry of waterproof building materials.

    沥青塑料油毡试验成功
    天津市油毡厂工程师张膺九在沈阳油毡厂技术员庄金生的协助下，试验成功世界上没有生产过的沥青塑料油毡。据初步鉴定，这种沥青塑料油毡在摄氏一百四十度不胶化，不粘，零下二十九度不折断、不裂纹；较普通油毡的防水性能高两倍多，使用年限也比一般油毡长久。沥青塑料油毡的试制成功，不仅可以满足基本建设对建筑防水材料的迫切需要，同时也是建筑防水材料制造工业的一项重大的技术改革。　（新华社）（附图片）
