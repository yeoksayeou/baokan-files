    Only Invites Ridicule
    Not long ago, the International Research Association, commissioned by the "New York Herald Tribune," conducted a public opinion survey in several countries, including West Germany. The question was: "Considering that the United States wants to provide your country with long-range rockets, would you be in favor of or against your country accepting U.S. rockets?" The survey results showed that among those surveyed, in West Germany, 17% were in favor of establishing U.S. rocket bases, and 54% were against; in Denmark, 18% were in favor, and 58% were against; in Japan, 9% were in favor, and 44% were against; in Sweden, 28% were in favor, and 46% were against...

    It is clear at a glance that those who oppose the establishment of U.S. rocket bases are in the majority. This naturally greatly disappointed the "New York Herald Tribune." However, the newspaper made a curious argument when commenting on the survey results. It said that the reason why people were opposed was because they believed that "accepting such support from the United States would increase people's hopes for the United States to a dangerous degree." This is simply incomprehensible nonsense. The "New York Herald Tribune" is clearly trying to use this nonsense to cover up the sentiment of the people of various countries against the U.S. policy of nuclear armament, as expressed in the survey results.

    But what other significance can this approach have besides inviting ridicule!

    Just a Habitual Trick
    On July 1st, the Associated Press released a piece of news, citing a spokesperson for the pro-Western government's irregular forces in Lebanon as saying that his troops had captured fifteen opposition nationalists, including three Syrian soldiers.

    This is a blatant fabrication. Responsible persons of the United Arab Republic immediately refuted it on July 2nd, saying that the Associated Press's report was completely fictitious and that "there are no Syrian members of the First Army of the United Arab Republic in Lebanon."

    In order to support the pro-Western government in Lebanon, and in order to quickly suppress the uprising of the Lebanese people, the United States and Britain have already employed various methods to find excuses for their direct or indirect armed intervention. This fabrication by the Associated Press also serves this purpose, but everyone can see clearly that this is just a habitual trick of the imperialists.

    札记
    只能招人耻笑
    不久以前，国际调查协会受“纽约先驱论坛报”的委托，在西德等几个国家内作了一次舆论调查。题目是：“如果考虑到美国要向你们的国家提供远程火箭的话，那末您是赞成还是反对你们的国家接受美国的火箭？”调查结果，在接受调查的人当中，西德赞成建立美国火箭基地的人占17％，反对的占54％；丹麦赞成的占18％，反对的占58％；日本赞成的占9％，反对的占44％；瑞典赞成的占28％，反对的占46％……。
    一目了然，这个结果说明反对建立美国火箭基地的人是占上风的。这自然使“纽约先驱论坛报”大失所望。但是，这家报纸在评论调查结果时，却发了一通妙论。它说，那些人所以反对，是因为他们认为，“接受美国的这种支持就会使人们对美国的希望增加到危险的程度”。这简直是无法令人理解的混话。“纽约先驱论坛报”显然是想用这种混话把调查结果所表现出的各国人民反对美国核备战政策的情绪掩盖起来。
    但是，这种做法除了招人耻笑之外，还会有别的什么意义呢！
    惯技而已
    美联社在7月1日发布了一条消息，援引黎巴嫩亲西方政府的非正规部队发言人的谈话说，他的部队俘获了十五名反对派民族主义分子，其中包括三名叙利亚士兵。
    这是极为显明的捏造。阿拉伯联合共和国负责人士在7月2日立即加以驳斥，他说，美联社的这则消息完全是虚构，“在黎巴嫩没有阿拉伯联合共和国第一军的任何叙利亚成员”。
    美英两国为了扶植黎巴嫩的亲西方政府，为了迅速镇压黎巴嫩的起义人民，已经施展了种种手法，想给它们直接或间接进行武装干涉寻找借口。美联社的这次捏造，也是服务于这一目的，但是，谁也看得清楚，这不过是帝国主义者的惯技而已。
