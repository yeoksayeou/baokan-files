He's on the Right Track
——On Yan Qijia's Learning and Innovating Technology
By Our Reporter Cao Baoming

A Table and Two Lessons

Yan Qijia's learning of technology began with filling out a table.

Two months after he arrived at the Yunmeng Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, the original Director Zhang walked into his room one morning and said, "I'm very busy these days. The Provincial Bureau needs this table urgently. You fill it out." Then she turned and left. He picked up the form and looked at it carefully. Alas, it was a "Line Statistics Table," full of technical terms he had never heard of, such as switchboard, seat, pole kilometers… He was immediately furious: "You wouldn't give me work when I asked for it; now you give me something I don't understand at all, and you don't even explain it. Isn't this deliberately making things difficult for me!"

He had a reason for being so angry. He was originally a district Party committee deputy secretary from a farmhand background. The provincial Party committee had instructed various localities to strengthen leadership in the postal and telecommunications departments, so he was transferred to serve as the bureau director. The evening he arrived at the bureau, he took the initiative to find the original Director Zhang to understand the situation, but this woman, who had worked in the postal and telecommunications department for many years, only cried and didn't speak, giving him the cold shoulder. He approached her several times, and it was always the same. Later, the county Party committee called them both in and decided that he would be in charge of administrative and political ideological work, and she would be in charge of business. But how should the administrative and business work of the enterprise be divided? He didn't understand. He went to Director Zhang again: "Give me some work to do!" She glanced at him from behind her glasses, sneered, and said, "There's nothing to do. If there are any disputes or problems in the bureau, you can do ideological work. If there are no problems, you can rest. Didn't the Party committee say you were sick!" He couldn't stand being idle, so he went to her again, and she still said the same old thing: "There's nothing to do." He dragged on like this for two months without doing any work, which was very distressing. At this time, several employees who were close to Director Zhang spread the word: "The Party committee has sent an amateur to our postal and telecommunications department, taking money and not doing anything." He was very annoyed when he heard this: "Did the revolution turn me into someone who takes money and does nothing?"

Originally, he could have given the table to the line maintenance team to fill out. But he remembered that the county Party secretary had smiled and asked him a few days ago: "Old Yan, let me ask you, how did you go from being a farmhand to a district Party committee secretary?" "When you first joined the district Party committee, you were so anxious that you cried when you were asked to write a summary report! Didn't you write quite well later? If you don't understand, just learn. Isn't there anything in the world that can't be learned?" He used to have a knack for learning culture. Every night, he would write down fifteen new characters and ask people about them the next day, not afraid of being laughed at even if he didn't understand them the first time. He made up his mind: "Now I have to not be afraid of embarrassment. If I don't understand, I'll ask the masses!"

He went to the line maintenance team and found Cheng Ruiqing, a technician in his forties who had been working in telecommunications for more than twenty years, who explained to him sincerely: "Telephones are divided into switchboards and individual phones. A switchboard is also called an exchange. The number of switchboards is the number of seats. Capacity refers to the number of lines a switchboard has. The model refers to the brand and type of the machine. We only have one switchboard in our room, which is a Nanjing floor-standing type…" He listened and took notes, not only filling out the table immediately but also learning some knowledge.

From this, he drew two lessons: one is that to work in an enterprise, you must learn technology; the other is that you must learn technology from the masses. In addition to studying technology from books, he also went to string lines with the line maintenance workers, operated the switchboard with the telephone operators, distributed letters with the postal workers, and sold stamps with the clerks… learning while doing. Through long-term hard study and practice, he not only became familiar with the production process but also learned how to climb poles, connect wires, and install individual phones. He used the method of breaking down operations to calculate detailed accounts with the line maintenance workers, increasing their line-stringing efficiency from an average of one and a half poles per work unit to three poles. He and the deliverymen inspected the postal routes together, drew new route maps, and enabled eight of the sixteen townships in the county to see the provincial newspaper on the same day.

How to Support the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture

One late night after the Spring Festival, the lights in the county town had long been extinguished. Yan Qijia was still pacing back and forth in the smoky little house with a candle, pondering a question: how to support the Great Leap Forward in agriculture?

Suddenly, he remembered that he had gone to Wuluo Township last month to inspect the postal route and saw that it took seven rings to make a call, and it still wouldn't connect. He asked what was going on, and the post office director muttered to him: "Isn't it because we lack switchboards? The phones of seven agricultural cooperatives are all connected to a pair of lines at the township government. When one place rings, all seven places ring at the same time, so we have to use the number of rings to distinguish who wants the phone. Even so, it often takes an hour or two to get a call through, which is very disruptive." At the time, he thought: "With the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, every cooperative will install a phone, so this problem has to be solved."

Of course, the solution was to purchase switchboards. They had applied for ten switchboards, each with twenty lines and costing 370 yuan. Regardless of the price, the big question was when these switchboards would arrive.

"Can we find our own way to solve this problem?" He suddenly felt enlightened. In 1949, he had seen a very simple "connection plug board" in Yitang Township. At that time, there was a shortage of telecommunications equipment, so they used this thing to replace the switchboard and control three or four phones, which worked quite well. And this plug board was made by Cheng Ruiqing, the bureau's line maintenance worker.

The next day, he went to Cheng Ruiqing to discuss it. Cheng Ruiqing said: "Making a plug board? It's better to make a small switchboard! This kind of small switchboard has jacks and numbers, and looks just like a big switchboard, but the structure is simpler." This old line maintenance worker can even make a small switchboard! This really made him overjoyed. He immediately said, "That's even better. Let's clean up the waste materials and see what we're missing, and send someone to Hankou to buy it."

They spent a total of 59 yuan and worked for twelve days and nights to make ten small switchboards with five lines each. Together with the six switchboards in the various post offices, every township in the county received one. Later, they further used waste materials to make nine fully equipped large switchboards (five of which had twenty lines), together with the one old switchboard in the bureau's inventory, so that the whole county achieved "every cooperative has a telephone, every township has a switchboard."

Why Not Dare to Think of Going to Heaven

At night, Yan Qijia was on duty at the switchboard. The county was opening wired broadcasting, and many units such as the Commerce Bureau and the Grain Bureau repeatedly called, saying they had urgent matters and needed to make long-distance calls to the townships. However, the county's broadcasting used telephone lines, and every night at this time, the telephones in all the townships in the county were closed. He told them to wait until the broadcasting was over before making the calls. Who knew that just two hours after the broadcasting ended, the county Party committee held a county-wide telephone conference, and these units didn't get to make their calls all night.

This situation once again touched his thinking: the Great Leap Forward has increased the business of various units. What if they all have urgent matters that can't be communicated by telephone like today? He saw a section in "Telecommunications Construction" that specifically discussed "phantom circuits." Their bureau had used "phantom circuits" before. This method is: a pair of lines can originally only have one pair of phones talking at the same time, but by adding a pair of transposing coils at both ends of the line, the principle of electrical induction can be used to allow two pairs of phones to talk on a pair of lines at the same time. If telephones can use "phantom circuits," then broadcasting should also be able to use "phantom circuits"! He wanted to use this method to allow the township telephones to be open during broadcasting hours, so that all the telephones in the county would be open day and night.

As soon as he told Cheng Ruiqing his idea, the old line maintenance worker was startled and asked, "Do you remember what the provincial radio station requested when the broadcasting station was established?"

"When broadcasting lines and telephone lines are parallel, they must be sixty meters apart."

"That's right, the two pairs of lines have to be so far apart, how can you put them on a pair of lines?"

"He's talking about his regulations, I'm thinking about my ideas."

"Then you're really thinking of going to heaven."

"Hey, you have to think of going to heaven. The Soviet Union's artificial satellites have already gone to heaven, and they will go to the moon in the future! Why don't we dare to think?"

The second time he went to Cheng Ruiqing to study, Cheng still thought it was impossible because the voltage difference between broadcasting and telephone was too large. He said: "Although the book doesn't say that broadcasting can use 'phantom circuits,' it doesn't say that broadcasting can't use it either!" Cheng still disagreed. "This person is probably timid, afraid of taking responsibility if something goes wrong." So he bluntly proposed: "We'll experiment because no one has done it before. Let's start with a pair of old individual phones. Let's also divide the work: if the experiment fails and the transposing coil is burned, I'll compensate for it. If the organization wants to punish us, they'll punish me, not you. If the coil of the individual phone is burned, you'll repair it."

Their experiment began on March 6. The first experiment proved that telephone and broadcasting could be open on a pair of lines at the same time, and there was no impact on the lines or machines, only the "crosstalk" was greater (the sound of broadcasting was picked up on the telephone). At this time, Cheng Ruiqing became active and came up with a way to reduce crosstalk using "double stranded coils," reducing the crosstalk to lower than a single line telephone. They experimented a total of four times. The last time was on March 11, with a distance of ten kilometers, and the results were normal and the conversation was very clear.

Their creation was a success! The county Party secretary came to congratulate them in person and asked them to quickly summarize and promote it. Liu, the section chief of the county telephone section of the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, also came to take measurements and said he would report it to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. Immediately afterwards, thirty-six county (city) postal and telecommunications bureaus in sixteen provinces, including Heilongjiang, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Zhejiang, wrote official letters, sent telegrams, and made phone calls to ask them to introduce this experience. Wuyang, Henan, simply sent people to learn on the spot.

Giving a Lesson to the Technical Authority

However, when Section Chief Liu excitedly returned to the Provincial Bureau to report, Chief Engineer Zhu of the Provincial Bureau said that he lacked experience and had overlooked the technical problems. Everyone discussed it, and that was indeed the case: phantom circuits are an outdated and unpromising technology, and their construction regulations do not even allow telephones to use phantom circuits, so how can they use phantom circuits to open broadcasting? This raised two questions: one is that phantom circuits have crosstalk and poor call quality; the other is that broadcasting voltage is high, and if the line breaks, an accident may occur, electrocuting the duty officer. Chief Engineer Zhu and Deputy Director Feng also carefully drafted a telegram to be sent to all county bureaus in the province, first affirming that the creation of the Yunmeng Bureau "is good," and then saying that "personal safety accidents may occur, and its use will not be promoted for the time being" "pending research and improvement by the Provincial Bureau."

On April 23, Section Chief Liu came with instruments to measure. At this time, all six post offices in the county had promoted it, and the longest line was twenty-eight kilometers. The county's cadre review reports, agricultural requests, and many other tasks were all communicated by telephone at night, which was very convenient, and they could increase their income by more than 25,000 yuan a year as a result. Yan Qijia explained to him, "We originally installed fuse tubes (safety devices), and there hasn't been a problem in more than a month." But he still insisted on the chief engineer's opinion: "It's unsafe, there's crosstalk, these are not allowed by technical regulations." After returning to the bureau, he sent another document, insisting that their crosstalk was very large, the conversation was unclear, and problems would occur.

Just as the two sides were in a difficult situation, Director Li, who was attending the National Postal and Telecommunications Cadre Conference in Beijing, encountered two things. One was that the "Chinese Postal and Telecommunications Workers" newspaper forwarded to him a letter from a reader, written by a reporter from Yunmeng County, criticizing their Provincial Bureau for suppressing the creations of those below. The other was that the Henan Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau had reported the results of the Wuyang County experiment to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and the minister greatly praised this creative spirit at the meeting. Director Li was really embarrassed at this time, but he had no choice but to brace himself and meet with the minister, stating that the experience of opening telephones and broadcasting at the same time was first created by the Hubei Yunmeng Bureau, and reviewing that he felt dull, while notifying the bureau to immediately send a person in charge to Yunmeng to understand what problems actually existed and quickly help solve them.

The members of the Provincial Bureau Party Committee, who regarded themselves as outsiders, also felt that the problem was serious at this time, and decided to send the director of the office and Chief Engineer Zhu to Yunmeng for inspection. Before leaving, Chief Engineer Zhu was still a little worried: "The safety and crosstalk problems are very big, and the relationship between the two sides is tense. How can we convince the Yunmeng Bureau?" But as soon as they arrived in Yunmeng, Yan Qijia asked them to personally make a call and take some measurements on the machine, and they realized that the "problems" were not as serious or difficult to solve as they had thought at home. Yan Qijia asked them if the crosstalk was large, and Chief Engineer Zhu sighed and said, "We who have telephones have not experienced the urgent needs of those who don't have telephones. We only listen to reports at home, hoping there is no crosstalk at all. The Provincial Bureau should be responsible."

On June 3, Chief Engineer Zhu and the newly appointed Director Zhang signed a notice to be sent to all county bureaus in the province, asking local areas to organize personnel to study and try out the creations of the Yunmeng Bureau. Chief Engineer Zhu also said to Director Zhang, "If we don't get out of the office and don't go deep down, we won't be able to understand many new technical problems." (Attached picture)

    他的路走对了
    ——记严齐家学习技术、革新技术
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    一张表报两条教训
    严齐家学技术，是从填写一张表报开始的。
    他到云梦邮电局两月后的一个上午，原来的张局长走进他房里说道：“我这几天忙得很，省局这个表要的很急，你把它填起来。”说完就转身走了。他把表格拿起来仔细一看，哎呀，竟是一张“机线统计表”，全印的是交换台、座席、杆程公里……他听也没听说过的技术用语。他顿时就气昏了：“向你要工作，你不给；一给却给个全不懂的，还不给讲一讲。这不是存心整人么！”
    他生这大的气，有个来由。他原是长工出身的区委副书记，省委指示各地加强邮电部门的领导，才调来担任局长的。他头天晚上到局里，第二天早晨就主动找原来的张局长了解情况，谁知这个在邮电部门工作多年的妇女却只哭不讲话，给他吃了个“闭门羹”。他找她几次都是这样。后来县委将他两人叫去，决定由他管行政和政治思想工作，她管业务。但企业的行政和业务该怎么分工呢？他不懂。他再去找张局长：“你分点事给我做吧！”她从眼镜后面瞟了他一眼，冷笑了一下说：“没有什么事情。局里要有人扯皮闹问题，你就去做工作。要没出问题，你就去休息。党委不是说你有病吗！”他闲不过，又去找她，她仍然是那句老话：“没有什么事情。”他就这样拖了两个月没做什么工作，很苦恼。这时，跟张局长亲近的几个职员又传出话来：“党委派了个外行到我们邮电部门来，拿钱吃饭，不能作事。”他听了非常恼火：“闹革命还把自己闹成白拿钱吃饭的人了？”
    本来，他也可以将表格交给机务组填去。但他想到县委书记前几天还笑着跟他讲：“老严呀，我问你，你是怎样由长工成了区委书记的？”“你刚参加区委的时候，叫你写个总结报告，你还急的哭哩！你后来不也写的挺不错。不懂就学嘛，天下还有学不会的事情？”他从前学文化真有股钻劲，每天晚上写下十五个生字，第二天见人就问，一遍不懂还问第二遍，也不怕人笑话。他拿定主意：“现在也得不怕丢丑，不懂就问群众去！”
    他去机线组找到四十多岁的程瑞卿，这个干了二十多年电信的机务员诚诚恳恳地向他讲解：“电话机分总机和单机。总机又叫交换台。有多少个交换台，就叫有多少座席。容量是指总机有多少个门子。程式是指机子的牌号和型式。我们房里只有一部总机，是南京落地式……”他一边听一边记，不仅马上填好了表格，还学了一些知识。
    他从此得出两条教训：一条是在企业工作必须学技术；一条是必须向群众学技术。除了从书本上钻研技术外，还去跟线务员一起架线，跟话务员值总机，跟邮务员分发信件，跟营业员卖邮票……一边作，一边问。经过长期的勤学苦练，他不仅熟悉了生产过程，而且学会了上杆子、接线头、装单机等操作。他用分解操作的办法，同线务员一道算细账，使他们的架线效率由平均一个工架一根半线杆提高到三根。他和投递员一起检查邮路，绘出新的路线图，使全县十六个乡有八个乡能见到当天的省报。
    怎样支援农业大跃进
    春节后的一个深夜，县城的电灯早熄灭了。严齐家还点着蜡烛，在烟雾迷漫的小屋里走来走去，苦苦地思索着一个问题：怎么支援农业大跃进？
    忽然，他想起他上月去伍落乡检查邮路，见那里打一个电话要一连摇七遍铃，还摇不通。他问这是怎么回事，邮电所长就跟他嘟囔开了：“还不是因为缺少总机。七个农业社的电话都搭在乡政府的一对线上，一处摇铃，七处同时响，只好用摇铃多少遍来区别要谁的电话。就这样，还常常摇一两个钟头也摇不通一个电话，很误事。”他当时就想：“农业大跃进，社社都会安装电话，这问题得解决才行。”
    当然，解决问题的办法是购置总机。他们已申请了十部总机，二十个门子的每部三百七十元，价钱大小暂且不谈，这些总机什么时候能到手呢？却是个大问题。
    “我们能不能自己想办法解决呢？”他的心情豁然开朗了。他1949年在义堂乡见过一个挺简单的“接线插头板”，当时电信器材缺乏，他们就用这玩艺代替总机控制了三四部电话，挺管用。而这个插头板就是局里的机务员程瑞卿制造的。
    第二天，他去找程瑞卿商量，程瑞卿说道：“造插头板？还不如造小总机呢！这种小总机有塞孔、有牌号，外表跟大总机一个样，就是构造简单些。”这老机务员还能造小总机！这真使他喜出望外。他马上讲道：“那更好。我们把废材料清理一下，看差些什么，派人去汉口添置。”
    他们一共花了五十九元，干了十二个日夜，便做出了五个门子的小总机十部，连同各邮电所的六部总机在内，使全县每个乡都分到了一部。他们后来又进一步用废料制出设备完全的大总机九部（其中有五部是二十个门子的），连同局存的一部旧总机，使得全县“社社通电话，乡乡总机化”。
    为什么不敢想上天
    夜晚，严齐家在总机上值班，县里开放有线广播，而商业局、粮食局好些单位都一再打电话来，说有急事要挂长途电话到乡里去。但是，县里的广播是借用的电话线路，每天晚上这个时间，全县各乡的电话都停止开放。他要他们等广播完了再挂。谁知两小时的广播刚完，县委又举行全县电话会议，这些单位一夜都没挂上电话。
    这个情况又触动了他的思想：大跃进使各单位的业务增加了，都像今天这样有了紧急事情通不了电话，叫人咋办呀？他在“电信建设”上看到有一节专门谈“幻线”的文章。他们局里从前也用过“幻线”。这种办法是：一对线上本来只能有一对话机同时通话，但在线路两头各加一对转电线圈，便能利用电感应的原理，使两对话机在一对线上同时通话。电话能用
  “幻线”，那广播也该能用“幻线”呀！他就想利用这个办法使各乡电话能在广播时间里开放，使全县的电话都日夜畅通无阻。
    他刚把自己的想法告诉程瑞卿，这个老机务员便吓了一跳，反问道：“你记得当初成立广播站时，省里的电台提了什么要求？”
    “广播线和电话线平行时，要相距六十公尺。”
    “对呀，两对线路都得隔这么远，怎么能搞在一对线上？”
    “他说的是他的规程，我想的是我的想法。”
    “那你真想到天上了。”
    “咳，就得想上天。苏联的人造卫星早就上了天，将来还会到月亮上去！我们为什么不敢想？”
    他第二次去找程瑞卿研究，程还是因为广播与电话的电压相差太大，认为不可能。他说：
  “虽然书上没讲广播能用‘幻线’，但它也没有讲广播不能用呀！”程还是不同意。“这人大概是胆子小，怕出了问题负不起责任。”他就直截了当提出：“过去没有人做过，我们就试验，先用一对旧单机试验。我们还分一下工：如果试验失败，烧了转电线圈，由我赔偿。组织上要处分，也处分我，跟你不相干。如果烧了单机的线圈，由你修理。”
    他们的试验便从3月6日开始了。第一次试验就证实了电话和广播可以在一对线上同时开放，对线路、机器都没有影响，只是“串音”大些（广播的声音串到电话里了）。这时，程瑞卿积极起来了，并想出了用“双股线圈”减小串音的办法，将串音降到比单线电话还低。他们一共试验了四次，最后一次是3月11日，两下相距十公里，结果情况正常，听话很清楚。
    他们的创造成功了！县委书记亲自来祝贺他们，要他们赶快总结推广。省邮电局县内电话科的刘科长也来做了测定，表示要上报邮电部。紧接着，黑龙江、广西、四川、浙江一共有十六个省的三十六个县（市）邮电局，都写公函、拍电报、挂电话来，要他们介绍这项经验。河南舞阳更干脆派了人来就地学习。
    给技术权威上了一课
    但是，当刘科长兴冲冲地回省局汇报的时候，省局祝总工程师却说他缺乏经验，疏忽了技术上存在的问题。大家一议论，可不正是这样：幻线是个过时了的、没有前途的技术，他们的建筑规章连电话使用幻线都不允许，怎么能用幻线开放广播呢？这样就出来两个问题：一是幻线有串音，通话质量不好；一是广播电压高，如果线路断了，便可能发生事故，电死值机员。祝总工程师还同冯副局长一起字斟句酌地拟了一个发给全省各县局的电报，首先肯定云梦局的创造“是好的”，然后才说“可能发生人身安全事故，目前暂不推广使用”，
    “待省局研究改进”。
    4月23日，刘科长带着仪器来测定了。这时候，全县六个邮电所都推广开了，最长的线路有二十八公里。县里的审干汇报、农业请示和许多工作都是在晚上通电话，很方便，而他们一年也可因此增加收入二万五千多元。严齐家向他解释：“我们原来就装了熔线管（保安装置），一个多月都没出问题。”但他仍然坚持总工程师的意见：“不安全，有串音，这都是技术规程不允许的。”回局后又发来一个文件，硬说他们的串音很大，讲话听不清楚，而且会出问题。
    正在两下难分难解的时候，在北京参加全国邮电干部会议的李代局长遇到了两桩事情。一桩是“中国邮电工人”报转给他一封读者来信，这是云梦县报记者写的，批评他们省局压制下面的创造。一桩是河南省邮电局将舞阳县试验的结果上报邮电部了，部长在会上大大表扬这种创造精神。李代局长这时被闹的真尴尬，但也只好一方面硬着头皮去见部长，声明电话与广播同时开放的经验是湖北云梦局首先创造出来的，并检讨自己感觉迟钝，一方面通知局里马上派负责人去云梦实地了解究竟存在什么问题，赶快帮助解决。
    以外行自居的省局党委的成员们这时也感到问题严重，决定由办公室主任同祝总工程师去云梦检查。出发前，祝总工程师心里还有些打忤：“安全和串音的问题都很大，而两下的关系又闹僵了，怎么能说服云梦局呢？”但他们刚到云梦，严齐家便请他们亲自在机上通了一番话和作了一番测定，他们才发现“问题”都不像他们在家里想的那样严重，那样难解决。严齐家问他们串音大不大，祝总工程师感叹地说：“我们有电话的人，没有体会到没电话人的迫切需要。我们只在家里听汇报，希望一点串音也没有。省局应该负责。”
    6月3日，祝总工程师又和新来的张局长签署了一个发给全省各县局的通知，要各地组织人员研究和试用云梦局的创造。祝总工程师还向张局长讲：“再不走出办公室，再不深入下去，对许多新的技术问题都无法理解了。”（附图片）
