Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 24th: The military intervention of the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan is part of a broad and long-term plan by them to suppress national liberation movements, and is the result of a series of secret agreements concluded as early as the Suez Crisis, according to an article published in the Soviet "Red Star" on the 23rd.

The article cited a passage from "France-Soir" to prove this point. This passage revealed that these secret agreements between the US and British governments clearly assigned tasks for the US-British military intervention in the Middle East. According to the stipulations, the United States should "take action" in the western part of the Middle East, including Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Libya, and Egypt, while Britain should "defend" Western interests in the eastern part of the Middle East, including Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, and Bahrain.

The "Red Star" article continued, stating that it is clear that the aggressive actions of US-British imperialism in Lebanon and Jordan are only the first step in a colonial war against the people of the Arab East. The purpose of US-British intervention is not only to suppress the national liberation movements in Lebanon and Jordan, but also to use bayonets to maintain the regimes of reactionary rulers who have already lost the support of the masses and their own armies. The imperialists intend to use the territories of Lebanon and Jordan as military offensive bases to suppress the Iraqi revolution, and then restore the colonial system throughout the Near and Middle East.

The colonialists are attempting to realize the sinister plan of making Arabs fight Arabs. According to foreign press reports, Turkish and Iranian troops are gathering in the Iraqi border region. While preparing to attack Iraq, the United States and Britain are using new provocative actions to oppose other independent Arab countries. US imperialism is threatening the United Arab Republic with force, and on the Syrian border region of the UAR, Israeli troops are beginning to assemble.

    “红星报”揭露美英侵略整个中东的阴谋
    新华社莫斯科24日电  美国和英国对黎巴嫩和约旦的军事干涉是他们镇压民族解放运动的广泛和长期策划的一部分，是早在苏伊士危机的时候就开始缔结的一系列秘密协定的结果。这是苏联“红星报”23日刊登的一篇文章中说的。
    这篇文章援引“法兰西晚报”的一段话证明了这一点。这段话透露，美、英政府这些秘密协定对美英军事干涉中东的任务作了明确的分配。按照规定，美国应在包括黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、利比亚和埃及的中东西部“动手”，而英国则应“保卫”西方在中东东部的利益，其中包括伊拉克、约旦、科威特和巴林。
    “红星报”这篇文章接着说，很显然，美英帝国主义者在黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略行为只是反对阿拉伯东方人民的殖民战争的第一步，美英干涉的目的不仅是要镇压黎巴嫩和约旦的民族解放运动，而且还要用刺刀来保持住已经失去了人民群众和自己军队支持的反动统治者的政权。帝国主义者打算利用黎巴嫩和约旦的领土作为镇压伊拉克革命的军事进攻基地，然后再在整个中近东恢复殖民制度。
    殖民者正在企图实现使阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人的罪恶计划。据外国报刊报道，在伊拉克边境地区，土耳其和伊朗军队正在集结起来。美国和英国在准备进攻伊拉克的同时，正在以新的挑衅行为来反对其他独立的阿拉伯国家。美帝国主义者正在以武力威胁阿拉伯联合共和国，在阿联的叙利亚地区边境上，以色列军队正开始集结。
