Overcoming New Difficulties of Steel Shortage and Lack of Equipment
Dali Sets Up More Than 500 Small Factories

(Our newspaper, Xi'an, 8th dispatch) Reporter Yi Xiao reports: Dali County, Shaanxi Province, is carrying out an "anti-drought movement" in industry, establishing a large number of local factories despite the shortage of steel and equipment.

Dali is a small county on the Guanzhong Plain, half sand dunes and half plains, with few resources and lacking "metal" in the "five elements," and it had no industrial base in the past. In early April of this year, the Dali County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed that the whole people should run local industries in a big way, planning to establish four industrial networks throughout the county: agricultural tool manufacturing, fertilizers, electricity, biogas, and agricultural product processing. However, they immediately encountered the difficulty of lacking steel and equipment, and the progress of factory construction was very slow. Many people expressed a lack of confidence in running industry without steel. At this critical juncture, the County Committee proposed to promote the spirit of drought-resistant planting in industry and to run industry in a big way despite the lack of steel.

Under the guidance of this idea, a mass movement to collect steel was launched throughout the county. Each person contributed one to two jin of scrap steel and copper, and the county commercial departments organized purchasing teams and held exhibitions of scrap copper and iron. In half a month, the 170,000 people in the county collected 170,000 jin of iron and hundreds of jin of copper. At the same time, a large number of measures were taken to substitute wood for iron, which basically solved the county's steel shortage this year.

The county handed over the collected scrap steel to the County Agricultural Tool Repair Factory, except for a portion that was used to exchange for machinery and equipment in Xi'an, Xianyang, and other places, to manufacture equipment for the newly built small factories. This factory not only manufactured equipment itself and expanded the factory, but also became a mother factory for mass production of small factories. They also put forward the slogan of "using indigenous machines to make foreign machines, using wooden lathes to make iron lathes."

In the construction of small factories, Dali County also adopted a large number of indigenous methods. In order to enable every township and commune to establish flour mills, feed mills, and bone meal factories, they universally adopted water-powered improved stone mills and animal-powered accelerated mills to grind flour and crush feed.

As a result of these measures, the county has established more than 500 factories. These factories have produced more than 200 kinds of new products in just over a month, supplying the needs of farmers' production and life.

### 战胜缺钢铁少设备的新困难  大荔办起五百多个小工厂

    战胜缺钢铁少设备的新困难
    大荔办起五百多个小工厂
    本报西安8 日电  记者伊晓报道：陕西省大荔县开展工业上的“抗旱运动”，在缺钢铁少设备的情况下，办起大批地方工厂。
    大荔是关中平原上的一个小县份，一半沙丘，一半平川，资源不富，“五行”缺金，过去又没有工业基础。今年4月初，中共大荔县委提出了全民大办地方工业，计划在全县内建立起农具制造、肥料、电力、沼气和农产品加工四个工业网，可是当下就碰上了缺钢铁少设备的困难，建厂进度很慢。许多人对于没有钢铁办工业表现信心不足。在此紧急关头，县委提出要在工业上发扬抗旱点种的精神，在缺乏钢铁的情况下，大办工业。
    在这一思想指导下，全县开展了一个群众性的收集钢铁运动。一人献一斤到二斤废钢铁和铜，县商业部门组织收购组，并举行废铜烂铁展览。全县十七万人在半个月时间内，就收集了十七万斤铁和数百斤铜。同时大量采取了以木代铁的措施，基本上解决了全县今年钢铁缺乏的困难。
    这个县把收集到的废钢除了用其中一部分到西安、咸阳等地调换回机械设备外，其余的交给县农具修造厂来为新建小工厂制造设备。这个厂不仅自己制造了设备，扩建了工厂，而且成为大量生产小工厂的母亲工厂。他们还提出口号要“用土机器造洋机器，用木车床造铁车床。”
    大荔县在建设小工厂中还大量地采用了土办法，不用铁机器，为了乡乡社社都能建立面粉厂、饲料厂和骨粉厂等，普遍采用了水力改良石磨和畜力加速磨来磨粉和进行饲料粉碎。
    由于采取了这些措施，这个县已经办起了五百多个工厂。这些工厂在一个多月时间内生产了二百多种新产品，供应了农民生产和生活的需要。
