    Backward Equipment, Advanced Products
    By our reporter, Wang Jian
    Who would have thought that in just the last three months, the Xi'an Public-Private Joint Venture Metrology Repair Factory, a backward factory that used to mainly make wooden steelyards, could produce a batch of large ground scales capable of weighing cars?
    The total assets of the metrology factory are only a little over 130,000 yuan. It only has four belt lathes and two shaky drilling machines. Of the factory's 180-plus employees, none are engineering technicians, and aside from nine skilled workers, the rest are apprentices. The factory director, Luo Siwei, was originally a textile worker. In 1956, when this factory was formed by merging more than 40 steelyard shops, it coincided with the high tide of agricultural cooperativization across the country. At that time, the large quantities of wooden steelyards produced were very popular in the market. Later, market demand changed, and no one wanted steelyards anymore, but the urgently needed large ground scales on the market could not be made. By January of this year, 110,000 yuan worth of products were piling up in the warehouse. The factory relied on borrowing money to buy materials and pay wages. The workers all thought, "Everyone else is in the Great Leap Forward, but our factory is so poor it's about to close down." When Luo Siwei went to meetings at the local industrial bureau, he always hid in the least conspicuous corner. The workers were even ashamed to walk down the street. Zhou Xiayun, a technician who repaired balances and had been transferred from Shanghai, often thought about leaving Xi'an and returning to Shanghai because the factory's equipment was so poor.
    The times are leaping forward, and the Party requires the metrology factory to make a Great Leap Forward. When the factory was discussing and formulating a leap forward plan in February, it only proposed a total output value target of 600,000 yuan. At three cadres' meetings, the entire factory was silent, and only Luo Siwei gave speeches. When people from higher levels came to help formulate the plan, Wang Hongbi, the private sector's production section chief, said, "Who doesn't want to put powder on their face? Without adding machines or people, I think the leap forward... " He chuckled and lowered his head, refusing to say anything more. The workshop directors all adopted the attitude of following whatever the factory director did. It seemed that a real leap forward was impossible.
    No money, no people, no equipment. Being both poor and lacking became obstacles to the metrology factory's leap forward. People like Wang Hongbi, who were superstitious about equipment, believed that unless the higher authorities allocated 40,000 yuan in funds and transferred six new-style lathes, this hurdle could not be overcome. However, the Chinese Communist Party branch of the metrology factory did not see it that way. "Adding equipment is hardly a leap forward!" After studying the situation, the branch decided to rely on mobilizing all the factory's employees to change this difficult situation and break through despite being both poor and lacking. The three leading Party cadres—factory director Luo Siwei, deputy director Xie Duanzhi, and Party branch secretary Liu Rongjie—went to the workers to find solutions.
    In fact, the workers had already come up with good ideas. Zhu Xicheng, a fitter, suggested, "People say our factory can't sell small things and can't make big things. I think we should make large ground scales. Many units in Shaanxi have to run to the Northeast and North China and wait a year and a half to order them. Why can't we make them?!" Wang Hongbi, the production section chief, sneered and said to factory director Luo Siwei, "Don't listen to him, our factory doesn't have the equipment to make large scales." He rattled off a list of equipment. However, worker Zhu Xicheng said, "If we don't have that equipment, we can carve out a ground scale with our hands. Grind a steel beam into a sewing needle, and success will come naturally." Wang mocked, "Oh, you're really an 'impulsive one'!" Zhu Xicheng thought to himself, "Ah, Section Chief Wang! You only want to solve problems using the methods of a large factory. You can only calculate the equipment's capacity precisely, but you can't calculate our workers' hands." The factory leaders also solicited the opinions of other workers, and most people said that a poor factory has its own ways. Repairing the old machines can also get things done. The factory Party branch decided to forge ahead and manufacture large ground scales. They encouraged the workers, saying, "Do it! Everything is created. Don't be afraid of failure. Failure is the mother of success."
    Relying on the wisdom and hands of the workers, there will be ways to overcome difficulties. When the metrology factory made its first 15-ton large ground scale, it borrowed money to buy materials because it had no money. Without a single blueprint or draftsman, Liang Chunsheng, a measurer who knew some drafting, used his rest time at the coal plant to measure the dimensions of a 15-ton scale and draw the blueprint. When the large I-beams were bought back, they couldn't be carried in because the factory gate was narrow. They placed them on the sidewalk and used the sidewalk as a temporary workshop. They spent three days using a handsaw instead of an electric saw to cut the materials. When processing large castings, they used a small shaper with a short stroke because they didn't have a planer. To drill holes in the beams, they converted a hand drill into a belt-driven drill press. However, the belt-driven drill press couldn't hold the workpiece securely, and the power wasn't enough, so several people held the large workpiece that extended out of the workshop door. At the same time, they turned off all the lathes at night to provide power for the drill press. To drill large holes with a diameter of five fen, the small drill bits were useless, and the factory didn't have a large drill press. They borrowed an electric drill from the hardware factory, but the hardware factory couldn't spare one, so the workers waited until the hardware factory finished using it during the day and borrowed it at night, stringing up lights to drill the holes. One day, they finally managed to borrow it during the day when the hardware factory was closed. Unexpectedly, after drilling only halfway through one hole, the hardware factory's workers needed to work overtime, so they quickly rode their bicycles to return it, waited for the hardware factory to finish using it, and then took it back. In this way, they finally made this large ground scale. It was time to test it, but for such a large and heavy piece of equipment, 6.48 meters long and 2.78 meters wide, most factories used power cranes to lift and place the weights for testing. The place where the metrology factory installed the scale was just a temporary shed, so there was no such modern equipment. What to do? They had plenty of people. Workers and cadres used manpower to move the 15-ton weights down. Just when the task was about to be completed, with a "crack," the tie rod joint of the ground scale beam broke during the 20% overload test. Everyone's hearts sank at that moment. Zhu Xicheng quickly crawled under the scale and saw that when drawing the blueprint, they had not clearly identified that this part should be made of wrought iron. The forgers and machinists worked overnight to make wrought iron parts, and the test was successful as soon as they were installed. Finally, the person in charge of the Xi'an Metrology Verification Institute came to formally verify it. He said, "I really didn't expect this from your metrology factory. This is the first large scale made in the Northwest. It is accurate, beautiful, and durable." When all the factory employees heard this evaluation, they were extremely happy. At this time, Wang Hongbi said with conviction, "The workers' skills are truly immeasurable!" Since then, the second 15-ton ground scale has been put into production, and a 20-ton ground scale has also been successfully trial-produced.
    After breaking down superstitions and severing many ropes that bound people's minds, people will believe in their own strength. The birth of the first large ground scale liberated some people from the superstition of worshipping equipment. The direction of the metrology factory is correct. Being both poor and lacking seemed like a bad thing, but being poor with no equipment and circulating funds, and lacking technical experience in making new products, forced them to use their own wisdom and hands to change this situation, which was a good thing. This factory was still in the red by more than 1,000 yuan in January. In February, they manufactured four new products, and customers were overwhelmed. In addition to paying off old debts, they made a net profit of more than 15,000 yuan. The total output value of the factory's leap forward this year can reach 1 million yuan, more than double last year. (Attached picture)

    装备落后  产品先进
    本报记者  汪坚
    谁也难以料到，仅在最近三个月内，一个落后的、一向以做木杆秤为主的西安公私合营度量衡修造厂，却造出一批能称汽车的大型地重衡来了。
    度量衡厂全部家底总共十三万多元。它只有四部皮带车床和两台摇头幌脑的钻床。全厂一百八十多人，没有一个工程技术人员，除了九个技术工人以外，尽是学徒；厂长罗四维原是个纺织工人。1956年，这个厂子由四十多个杆秤店合营的时候，正赶上全国农业合作化高潮，那时所生产的大批木杆秤，在市场上很吃香。后来，市场需要发生变化，杆秤没人要了，而市场上急需的大型地重衡又做不了。到今年一月份，价值十一万元的产品积压在仓库里。厂里买材料、开工资，都靠借债来解决。职工都这样想：“人家都在大跃进，我们厂穷得快关门了。”罗四维到地方工业局去开会，老躲在最不引人注意的角落里；工人在街上走路都害羞。从上海调来的修天平技工周夏云，看到厂里设备不行，常想离开西安回上海。
    时代在跃进，党要求度量衡厂大跃进。二月份全厂酝酿订跃进规划时，只提出了总产值六十万元的指标。三次干部大会上，全场鸦雀无声，只有罗四维一人唱独角戏。上级派人来帮助订规划时，私方生产股长王洪璧说：“谁不想把粉擦在脸上？不添机器不添人，我看跃进……。”他哼哈一笑便低下头再不啃声。车间主任们都抱着厂长怎办咱怎办的态度。看来真跃进不成了。
    要钱没钱，要人没人，要设备没设备。又穷又白，成了度量衡厂跃进的拦路虎。像王洪璧那样的迷信设备的人认为，除非上级拨四万元资金，再调六部新式车床，才能突破这一关。但是，中共度量衡厂党支部可不是这样看，“要添设备还算什么跃进？！”支部在研究之后，决定依靠发动全厂职工，来改变这种困难局面，在又穷又白的基础上钻出头来。三个党员领导干部——厂长罗四维、副厂长解端志和党支部书记刘荣杰，便到工人群众里去找办法。
    其实，工人群众早就有了好办法。钳工朱希成建议说：“人家都说咱厂小的卖不掉，大的做不了。我看就做大型地重衡。陕西许多单位为了买大秤，跑到东北和华北去等一年半载都订不上货。为什么我们不能做呢？！”生产股长王洪璧听了只冷笑，对厂长罗四维说：“别听他说，咱厂哪有做大秤的设备。”他一口就数出一堆设备名称。可是，工人朱希成说：“没有那些设备，我们就用手也能刻出个地秤来。钢梁磨绣针，功到自然成。”王股长讽刺说：“呵，真是个‘二冲子’！”朱希成心里想：“唉，王股长！你光想用大厂的办法解决问题，你只能把设备能力算得精细，你那能算计我们工人的两只手呢。”厂里领导人又征求其他工人的意见，大部分人说，穷厂自有穷法子，把旧机器修修也能弄成。厂党支部决定披荆斩棘地来制造大型地重衡，他们鼓励工人说：“做！一切都是创造出来的。失败也不怕，失败是成功之母。”
    依靠工人的智慧和双手，就会有克服困难的办法。度量衡厂做第一台十五吨的大型地重衡时，没有钱，就借钱买材料；没有一张图纸，没有一个绘图员，就让懂得一些绘图常识的尺工梁春生，利用煤球厂的休息时间，照十五吨重衡的样子量尺寸，绘出图来。大型工字钢买回来了，因为厂门窄狭，都抬不进。他们就摆在人行道上，把人行道当临时车间。他们花了三天时间，用手锯代替电锯，把材料截开。加工大型铸件时没有刨床，就用刀子走程短的小牛头刨，两头分开来加工。为了钻大梁的眼子，他们把一部手摇钻改成皮带钻床；但是皮带钻床卡不住活，力量也不足，就由几个人抱住伸出车间门的大活件干。同时，晚上关了全部车床的电门，供钻床打眼子用。打五分直径的大眼子，小钻头不顶事，厂里又没大钻床。向五金厂借电钻，五金厂腾不出来，工人就等五金厂白天用了以后晚上借去，拉上电灯钻眼子。有一天，好容易碰到五金厂休假，白天能借来用；不料一个眼子才钻透一半，五金厂的工人要加班赶活，他们就赶紧骑车子送去，等五金厂用完了再拿回来用。这样，他们终于把这台大型地重衡做成。要试验了，但是，像这样长六点四八公尺、宽二点七八公尺的大而重的设备，一般厂子都是用动力吊车起放法码来进行试验，度量衡厂安秤的地方不过是个临时草棚，哪有这种现代化设备。怎么办呢？他们有的是人。工人和干部用人力将重十五吨的法码搬下。眼看大功快告成了，不料，在加20％超量试验时，“卡”地一声，地重衡大梁的拉杆接头断了。那时大家的心都凉了。朱希成连忙钻到秤底一看，才发现当初绘图时，没看清这零件是应该用熟铁来做。锻工和车工连夜打成熟铁件，一安上便试成功了。最后，西安度量衡检定所的负责人亲自来正式检定。他说：“真没把你们度量衡厂看出来。这是西北做出的第一台大秤，准确、美观、耐用。”全厂职工怀着忐忑的心情，听到这个鉴定时，真是高兴极了。这时，王洪璧心服地说：“工人的技术可真没法估计呵！”此后，第二台十五吨的地重衡投入了生产，二十吨的地重衡也试制成功了。
    打破了迷信，冲断束缚思想的许多绳索之后，人们就会相信自己的力量。第一台大地重衡的诞生，使得有些人从崇拜设备的迷信中解放出来。度量衡厂的方向是走对了。又穷又白看起来是坏事；但是穷得没设备和周转资金，白得没制作新产品的技术经验，才迫逼着他们用自己的智慧和双手，来改变了这种面貌，这又是好事情。这个厂1月份还亏空一千多元，2月份里他们制造出四种新产品，顾主应接不暇，除了还清旧债，还净赚一万五千多元，全厂今年跃进总产值可达到一百万元，比去年增加一倍多。（附图片）
