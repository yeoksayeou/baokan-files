Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: According to TASS, the Soviet Union's third artificial earth satellite has been in operation for two months as of July 15th.  Mr. Poloskov, a member of the Soviet Committee for the International Geophysical Year, told TASS reporters about the fruitful scientific research results obtained by this satellite in the past two months.

Poloskov pointed out that the operating conditions in the first two months showed that the complex scientific instruments on the satellite were carrying out the planned exploration program and were working normally.

The "Beacon" radio transmitter installed on the satellite is working well. Moreover, when the satellite is in a sunlit area, the radio transmitter is powered by its own solar battery pack. This can be seen from the nature of the received signals. The first trial installation of this type of solar battery pack on a satellite and its successful use is of great significance, because this energy source is very promising for future manned spacecraft.

Countries all over the world are receiving the "Beacon" call sign. In this way, the scientific data it sends out through various signals has become the wealth of scientists all over the world. It is worth pointing out that scientists conducting explorations in Antarctica have also received the satellite's radio signals.

The scientific data sent back by the satellite is being systematically accumulated and interpreted. Preliminary sorting of data from all scientific exploration aspects is now underway. However, a detailed study of the scientific data and drawing conclusions will take a long time.

During the relatively short period of the third satellite's existence, new and important data on the electrical properties of the upper atmosphere at very high altitudes, unreachable by ground equipment, has already been obtained. We have also obtained valuable data on the ionic composition and structural parameters of the upper atmosphere, as well as its pressure and density.

For the first time, data was obtained on micrometeoroids—the smallest particles of interplanetary solid matter.

The radio transmitter also transmitted data on observations of cosmic gamma rays, which can help explore the processes of high-energy electromagnetic radiation occurring in the depths of cosmic space. In the past, air-sounding balloons were used to send instruments to the stratosphere, and a considerable amount of data on the composition of primary cosmic rays was accumulated. However, there is much data that cannot be obtained through measurements made in the stratosphere, because even above the instruments there will always be a thin layer of matter, which will also change the composition of cosmic rays. Until now, it has not been known whether cosmic rays contain a large number of nuclei of elements heavier than iron.

The instrument installed on the third satellite to record heavy nuclei may answer this important scientific question. Now it is already possible to talk about obtaining new and meaningful data on the total intensity, evolution, and composition of cosmic ray radiation through satellites.

Through the instruments installed on the third satellite, a new scientific phenomenon was discovered—a special microparticle radiation that had never been found in the composition of cosmic rays before. Experts are working hard to solve the mystery of this phenomenon.

    红色巨星两月来收获丰硕
    已获得有关高层大气电气特性、高层大气离子组成和结构参数及其压力和密度等宝贵资料
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：到7月15日为止，苏联第三个人造地球卫星已经运行了两个月了。苏联国际地球物理年委员会委员波洛斯科夫对塔斯社记者介绍了两个月来这个卫星所获得的丰硕科学考察成果。
    波洛斯科夫指出，头两个月的运行情况说明，卫星上的复杂的科学仪器正在执行预定的考察计划，工作是正常的。
    装在卫星上的无线电发射机“灯塔”工作得很好。而且当卫星位于太阳照得到的地方时，无线电发射机用本身的太阳能电池组工作。根据接收讯号的性质可以看出这一点。这种太阳能电池组在卫星上的第一次试装和它们的使用成功是有很大意义的，因为这种能源对于未来的人造宇宙飞船是非常有前途的。
    世界各国都在收“灯塔”的呼号。这样，它用各种讯号发出的科学资料就成了全世界科学家的财富。值得指出的是，在南极进行考察的科学家也收到了卫星的无线电讯号。
    卫星发来的科学资料正在有系统地加以积累和译解。现在已在对所有科学考察方面的资料进行初步整理。但是详细地研究科学资料并作出结论还需要很长的时间。
    在第三个卫星存在的还不算长的期间，已经获得了地面设备所达不到的很高的高空中的高层大气电气特性的新的重要资料。我们还获得了关于高层大气离子组成和结构参数及其压力和密度的宝贵资料。
    第一次获得了关于微流星——行星际固体物质的最小粒子的资料。
    无线电发射机还发出了关于观察宇宙丙种射线的资料，可以帮助探索宇宙空间深处发生高能量电磁辐射的过程。过去利用探空气球把仪器送到同温层，也积累了相当多的有关原始宇宙射线组成的资料。但是有许多资料是不可能利用在同温层进行的测量得到的，因为甚至在仪器上空还永远会有很薄的一层物质，它也会改变宇宙线的组成，直到现在还不知道宇宙线中有没有大量比铁核更重的元素的核。
    装在第三个卫星上的记录重核的仪器可能回答这个重要的科学问题。现在已经可以谈到通过卫星来获得关于宇宙线辐射总强度、演变和组成的新的有意义的资料了。
    通过装在第三个卫星上的仪器发现了新的科学现象——一种从前在宇宙线组成中没有发现过的特殊的微粒子辐射。专家们正在努力解答这个现象的谜。
