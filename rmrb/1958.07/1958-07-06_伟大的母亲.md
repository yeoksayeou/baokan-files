    Great Mother
    Shěn Qín
    In Sunchon County, sixty kilometers from Pyongyang, lives a great mother, Li Ying-suk, who is raising ten orphans who suffered from the ravages of war.
    Not long ago, we visited this family with many children. Near the Sunchon Kiln Factory, amidst a patch of green fields, stands a brand-new red brick and tile bungalow, which is Li Ying-suk's home. Her husband, Liu Jin, is the Party Committee Secretary of the Sunchon Kiln Factory. The workers of the factory specially built this house for them to take care of this group of orphans who lost their parents in the war and to commend Li Ying-suk's great maternal love.
    As we walked along the winding path between the fields towards this new residence, a group of neatly dressed, lively, and innocent children, along with their parents, immediately came out to greet us. The children bowed, saluted, shook hands, and greeted us politely one by one.
    The host introduced the background of these children to us. In 1950, Li Ying-suk began to raise her first orphan. By April 1953, she began to raise another two orphans. There is a poignant story behind how these two orphans became Li Ying-suk's sons. At that time, the Korean War was still going on. One day, after an enemy bombing raid, Li Ying-suk heard faint cries of infants coming from a nearby bombed-out air raid shelter. She hurriedly crawled into the collapsed shelter, where she found two crying babies. The adults next to them had been killed by the bombing. The two children looked to be less than a month old at the time. Li Ying-suk carried them home from the shelter. During wartime, and in the countryside, the difficulties of raising these two infants can be imagined. At that time, Li Ying-suk's husband, Liu Jin, had joined the army and gone to the front lines, and the family's income was very limited. Li Ying-suk tried every possible means to buy some glutinous rice and sugar, ground the rice into powder, made thin rice porridge, and fed the children bite by bite. Sometimes she even went hungry herself to make sure the children were fed. Now, the two boys named Liu Tie and Liu Yi are already five years old. They wear the same style of blue pants and white jackets, and they look exactly alike, just like a pair of biological brothers. They are the ninth and tenth children in the family. The other seven children were taken out of the orphanage by Li Ying-suk in 1955, when the state called on women to raise orphans on "June 1" Children's Day. The ages of these seven children are mostly similar, with two being eleven years old this year, four being ten years old, and one being seven years old. The year before last, Li Ying-suk gave birth to a little daughter of her own, becoming the eleventh child in the family.
    Everyone knows how difficult it is to raise eleven children. Li Ying-suk is a thirty-eight-year-old housewife. The children's father's income is not high, and the state only provides some care for the orphans in terms of food. Li Ying-suk relies on growing her own vegetables and sewing clothes, working diligently and frugally to manage the family's life. She led us to visit her own vegetable garden. The Chinese cabbage, peppers, scallions, tomatoes, bean pods, potatoes, and corn planted on the 300-ping (approximately one and a half mu in our country) of land are growing very luxuriantly. Li Ying-suk said that last autumn, she harvested fifteen straw bags of potatoes alone, and four and a half straw bags of various beans. She pickled four large vats of kimchi for the winter, and her family doesn't need to buy a single catty of vegetables in the market all year round. Li Ying-suk also raises a large number of chickens and pigs, and the family can eat meat twice a month. The money from selling eggs and fattened pigs can be used to buy new clothes for the family. In addition, she also raises a milk goat, which allows each child to have a small cup of goat milk every day. The white uniforms, little navy uniforms, and the girls' shirts and skirts worn by the boys are so neat and beautiful, all hand-sewn by Li Ying-suk.
    Under Li Ying-suk's care and education, the children all love to work. Recently, there has been a drought in Korea, and the children have all taken small basins to the nearby agricultural cooperative to help carry water to irrigate the land and fight the drought. Although the skin on the two girls' bodies has been peeled off by the sun, they are still determined to help with the work. Currently, a sanitation campaign is being carried out in Korea, and the children often take a fly swatter each and kill a matchbox of flies every day.
    The children help each other in life and in their studies, loving each other like biological siblings. The eldest orphan in the family, fifteen-year-old Liu Shun-ai, has become a capable assistant to her mother. Every morning, she helps her younger siblings wash their faces and get dressed, and goes to school with them. The children have also formed a brothers and sisters group, led by the eleven-year-old boy Liu Gang, who has the best grades. Every night, everyone gathers under the lamp to review their lessons together. Now, the six children who are in elementary school all have excellent or the best grades.
    Before we left this harmonious and warm big family, Liu Gang led his nine brothers and sisters in a song and dance troupe, and performed singing and dancing for us. Even the five-year-olds Liu Yi and Liu Tie sang earnestly and loudly. They sang songs praising the Labor Party and General Kim Il-sung. The girls also sang while dancing:
    Uncle Chinese People's Volunteer Army,
    Came to our house one day.
    Uncle Volunteer Army said to the children, come here! come here!
    The children smiled and hid behind their mother.
    Uncle Volunteer Army stayed in our house for three days,
    Uncle Volunteer Army said,
    Come here! come here!
    The children ran into the arms of Uncle Volunteer Army,
    Stroking the bright medal on his chest. (Attached image)

    伟大的母亲
    沈琴
    在离平壤六十公里的顺川郡，住着一位伟大的母亲李英淑，她养育着十个遭受战争灾害的孤儿。
    不久以前，我们访问了这个多子女的家庭。在顺川窑业工厂附近的一片绿色田野中，有一座崭新的红色砖瓦平房，这就是李英淑的家。她的丈夫刘槿是劳动党顺川窑业工厂党委员长，工厂的工人们为了照顾这一群在战争中失去父母的孤儿和表彰李英淑的伟大母爱精神，特地为他们新盖了这所住宅。
    当我们沿着弯弯曲曲的田间小道向这座新住宅走去时，一群穿得整洁的活泼天真的孩子跟着他们的爸爸妈妈立即迎了出来。孩子们一个个都很有礼貌地向我们鞠躬、敬礼，握手问好。
    主人向我们介绍了这群孩子的来历。1950年，李英淑开始抚养第一个孤儿。到了1953年4月间，她又开始抚养另外两个孤儿。这两个孤儿成为李英淑的儿子还有着一段辛酸的历史。那时，朝鲜战争还在进行着。一天，在敌机轰炸以后，李英淑听到从附近一个已被炸毁的防空洞中传出低弱的婴儿哭声。她急忙钻进塌了的防空洞，在那里她发现两个哭泣的婴儿，他们旁边的大人，已经被炸死了。这两个孩子当时看样子还没有满月。李英淑把他们从防空洞里抱回家去。战争时期又是在农村，要想把这两个婴儿养大，困难是可以想像得到的。那时李英淑的丈夫刘槿参军到前线去了，家里的收入很有限。李英淑想尽办法才买到一些糯米和砂糖，把米磨成粉，做成薄薄的米糊，一口一口喂这两个孩子。有时她甚至自己挨饿也要给小孩吃饱。现在，这两个名叫刘铁和刘一的男孩已经五岁了，他们穿着一个式样的蓝裤白褂，长得也一模一样，恰像一对亲兄弟。这就是他们家中的老九和老十。另外七个孩子是1955年“六一”儿童节国家号召妇女们养育孤儿时，李英淑从孤儿院里领出来抚养的。这七个孩子的年龄大都相仿，其中今年十一岁的有两个，十岁的四个，七岁的一个。前年，李英淑自己又生了一个小女儿，成了家庭中的第十一个孩子。
    人人都知道，养育十一个孩子是多么不容易的事情。李英淑是个三十八岁的家庭妇女，孩子们的父亲收入不多，只在粮食方面靠国家给孤儿们一些照顾。李英淑就靠自己种菜缝衣，勤俭劳动来安排一家人的生活。她领我们参观了她自己种的菜园，在三百坪（约合我国一亩半）的园地上种的大白菜、辣椒、葱、西红柿、豆荚、土豆和玉米长得都很茁壮。李英淑说，去年秋天仅土豆就收了十五草袋，各种豆类收了四草袋半，冬季腌了四大缸泡菜，一年四季她们家不需要到市上买一斤菜。李英淑还喂着大群的鸡和猪，每月可以给一家人吃两次肉。卖鸡蛋和肥猪的钱，可以为一家人添置新衣。另外，她还喂有一头奶羊，每天可以使每个孩子吃到一小杯羊奶。男孩穿的白制服、小海军服和女孩子们的衬衣短裙，都那末整齐而漂亮，这都是李英淑亲手缝制的。
    在李英淑的抚养教育下，孩子们都热爱劳动。最近朝鲜天旱，孩子们都拿着小面盆到附近的农业社去帮着顶水浇地抗旱。两个女孩的身上虽已被太阳晒脱了皮，但是她们仍然坚决要去帮助干活。现在朝鲜正在开展卫生运动，孩子们经常每人都拿一个蝇拍，每天打一火柴盒苍蝇。
    孩子们在生活上和学习上都互相帮助，相亲相爱，同亲兄弟姐妹一样。家庭中最大的孤儿、十五岁的刘顺爱已成为母亲的有力助手了。每天早上，她帮助弟弟妹妹们洗脸穿衣，同弟妹们一起上学。孩子们还组成了兄弟姐妹小组，由学习成绩最好的十一岁的男孩刘钢当组长。每天晚上大家聚在灯下一块温习功课，现在六个上小学的孩子，学习成绩都是优等和最优等。
    在我们临离开这个和睦温暖的大家庭之前，刘钢领着他九个兄弟姐妹组成的歌舞队，为我们表演了唱歌和跳舞。就连五岁的刘一和刘铁也认真地大声地唱着。他们唱了歌唱劳动党和金日成将军之歌。女孩子们还一边跳舞一边唱着：
    中国人民志愿军叔叔，
    一天来到我们的家。
    志愿军叔叔向孩子们说，你们来！你们来！
    孩子们笑着躲到了母亲的背后。
    志愿军叔叔在我们家住了三天，
    志愿军叔叔说，
    你们来！你们来！
    孩子们跑到志愿军叔叔的怀里，
    抚摩着他胸前灿烂的勋章。（附图片）
