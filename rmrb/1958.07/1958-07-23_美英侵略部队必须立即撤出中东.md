The Soviet representative stated on the 21st of this month at the Security Council that they could not accept Japan's proposal to so-called "strengthen the UN observer group" in Lebanon. This is because Japan's proposal did not call for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and British aggressor troops from the Middle East. In essence, it tacitly acknowledges the piratical actions of the United States in the Middle East and serves to help the United States "legitimize" its aggression by misusing the UN flag.

Japan has consistently adopted a two-faced attitude toward the Middle East crisis provoked by U.S. and British imperialism. The Japanese representative abstained from voting on the Soviet proposal in the Security Council, which demanded the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. It voted against the Swedish proposal to temporarily suspend the activities of UN observers in Lebanon, but voted in favor of the U.S. proposal to use the flag of a "UN police force" to "legitimize" its aggression against Lebanon. This fully demonstrates that Japan's position violates the proper stance of Asian countries. Japan's attitude toward the U.S. and British aggression against Asian countries like Lebanon and Jordan is even worse than that of an ordinary European country like Sweden. After all these proposals were rejected, Japan put forward its so-called "compromise" proposal. However, even United Press International reporters pointed out that UN diplomats believe that this proposal has a major loophole: "It does not specify that U.S. troops will withdraw from Lebanon, nor does it mention British troops in Jordan." It is not difficult to see that Japan's proposal actually seeks to recognize the "fait accompli" of the U.S. and British occupation of Lebanon and Jordan, allowing them to prolong this illegal occupation under the guise of continued activity by the UN observer group and to "legitimize" it. This is precisely in line with the needs of U.S. and British imperialism. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles welcomed the Japanese proposal, believing that it "could serve as the basis for UN action on the Lebanese situation." White House Press Secretary Hagerty stated that the United States supports the Japanese proposal, but refused to say whether the United States was prepared to withdraw its troops from Lebanon if the Japanese proposal was adopted. In this way, it is not difficult for people to see the essence of the Japanese proposal.

The United States has a precedent for attempting to misuse the UN flag to cover up its aggression. The UN flag was tainted long ago in the Korean War launched by the United States. This time, the United States is trying to use the UN flag once again to conceal its piratical face in the Middle East. The people of the world must oppose this conspiracy of the United States!

The UN Charter stipulates: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state." The U.S. military’s invasion of Lebanon and the British military’s invasion of Jordan, threatening Iraq and the United Arab Republic, are the most blatant violations of this provision. Eisenhower wants to find an excuse from Article 51 of the UN Charter, but Article 51 clearly stipulates that "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security." Is there any evidence that Lebanon has been subjected to armed attack? The whole world knows and recognizes: there is not! What exists there is purely a matter of internal affairs. As for Jordan, there is no such problem at all. On the contrary, the invasion of Lebanon and Jordan by U.S. and British troops constitutes the greatest threat to international peace and security.

In order to safeguard peace in the Middle East and the world, and in order to uphold the dignity of the UN Charter, it is necessary to resolutely stop the aggressive acts of U.S. and British imperialism in interfering in Lebanon, Jordan, and threatening Middle Eastern countries. Article 1 of the UN Charter stipulates: The purposes of the United Nations are "To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace." Therefore, on this extremely important issue relating to the sovereignty and independence of Middle Eastern countries and relating to peace in the Middle East and the world, the United Nations Organization is facing another serious test. Countries that truly cherish the principles of the UN Charter should promote the UN organization to take resolute measures to stop the aggression of U.S. and British imperialism. The primary step in stopping the aggressive acts of U.S. and British imperialism is to immediately withdraw U.S. and British aggressor troops from the Middle East.

After U.S. and British imperialism sent troops to occupy Lebanon and Jordan, they continued to transport their aggressive troops to the Middle East region to assemble. Why are U.S. and British imperialism engaging in armed intervention and war threats in such an arrogant manner? The matter is very clear. They not only want to occupy Lebanon and Jordan, but also want to use them as a foothold to carry out aggression against other countries in the Middle East. A dispatch from Washington published in the British "Observer" revealed that Dulles and Lloyd had reached an agreement: U.S. and British troops will not withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan in order to "protect other small countries from indirect aggression by infiltrating agents and inciting radio stations when necessary." People know that U.S. and British imperialism's aggression against Lebanon and Jordan was carried out under the absurd and shameless pretext that Lebanon and Jordan were subjected to "indirect aggression" by their own people. In his July 15 speech, U.S. President Eisenhower described the Iraqi people's overthrow of the Faisal dynasty as "indirect aggression" against Iraq. It is clear that U.S. and British imperialism have long prepared excuses for themselves to expand aggression and provoke war. Under such a serious situation, demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and British aggressor troops from the Middle East is not only a necessary step to uphold the dignity of the UN Charter, but also an urgent measure to prevent U.S. and British imperialism from expanding aggression and saving world peace.

Demanding the withdrawal of U.S. and British aggressor troops from the Middle East has become the common call of millions of peace-loving and freedom-loving people around the world. The United Arab Republic, India, Indonesia, Ceylon, the Soviet Union, China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, Poland, Romania, and Mongolia have all issued statements demanding the withdrawal of U.S. and British aggressor troops from the Middle East.

At the same time, this is also the common will of the people of Lebanon, the people of Jordan, and the people of other countries in the Middle East. If U.S. and British aggressor troops do not withdraw from the Middle East, the independence and security of Middle Eastern countries cannot be guaranteed, and peace in the Middle East and the world will inevitably continue to be threatened by U.S. and British aggressors.

The Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world will never tolerate the aggressive acts of U.S. and British imperialism. Arab countries threatened by U.S. and British imperialism's aggression and socialist countries that firmly support the national independence struggles of the Arab people have all expressed their attitudes and unanimously demanded that U.S. and British imperialism immediately stop their aggression. The tide of anger of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the entire world who oppose U.S. and British aggression continues to rise. The struggle of the people of the world will not cease until U.S. and British imperialism withdraw their aggressive troops from the Middle East!

### 美英侵略部队必须立即撤出中东

    美英侵略部队必须立即撤出中东
    本月21日，苏联代表在安全理事会上对于日本提出的所谓“加强联合国观察团”在黎巴嫩的活动的提案，表示不能接受。因为日本的提案，没有提出美英侵略部队立即撤出中东，反而在实质上默认美国在中东的海盗行径，并且为美国盗用联合国旗帜来使它的侵略行为“合法化”效劳。
    日本对于美英帝国主义挑起的中东危机，一直采取两面派态度。日本代表在安全理事会上，在表决苏联要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的提案时弃权；在表决瑞典要求暂时停止联合国观察员在黎巴嫩的活动的提案时投反对票；而对美国企图用“联合国警察部队”的旗帜来使它侵略黎巴嫩的行为“合法化”的提案，却投赞成票。这就充分说明日本的立场违反了亚洲国家的应有立场，日本对于美英侵略亚洲国家黎巴嫩、约旦的态度，还不如一个普通的欧洲国家如瑞典的态度。在这些提案全部遭到否决以后，日本提出了它的所谓“折衷”提案。但是，甚至合众国际社的记者也指出：联合国外交界人士认为这个提案有很大的漏洞：“它没有具体说明美军将从黎巴嫩撤退，也没有提到在约旦的英军”。这就不难看出，日本的提案，实际上是要承认美英军队侵占黎巴嫩和约旦的“既成事实”，使它们得以在联合国观察团继续活动的掩护下，把这种非法侵占拖下去，并且“合法化”。这恰恰符合美英帝国主义的需要。美国国务卿杜勒斯对日本提案表示欢迎，认为这个提案“可以作为联合国对黎巴嫩局势采取行动的根据”；白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂表示美国赞成日本提案，但拒绝说明如果日本提案获得通过，美国是否准备从黎巴嫩撤军。这样，人们就不难看出日本提案的实质了。
    美国企图盗用联合国旗帜来掩盖它的侵略行径，已经早有先例。联合国旗帜在美国所发动的朝鲜战争中早就遭到玷污了。这次美国又想再一次利用联合国的旗帜来掩饰它在中东的海盗面目。全世界人民必须反对美国的这个阴谋！
    联合国宪章规定：“所有会员国在它们的国际关系中不得以武力相威胁或使用武力来侵害任何国家的领土完整或政治独立。”美军侵入黎巴嫩，英军侵入约旦，威胁伊拉克和阿联，正是最粗暴地违反了这条规定。艾森豪威尔想从联合国宪章第五十一条寻找借口，可是五十一条明明规定，“联合国任何会员国受武力攻击时，在安全理事会采取必要办法，以维持国际和平及安全以前，本宪章不得认为禁止行使单独或集体自卫之固有权利”。难道黎巴嫩有受到武力攻击的事实吗？全世界都知道并且承认：没有！那里有的仅仅是纯粹属于内政的问题。至于约旦，更根本不存在这类问题。相反，美英军队侵入黎巴嫩和约旦，却构成了对于国际和平和安全的最大威胁。
    为了维护中东和世界的和平，为了维护联合国宪章的尊严，必须坚决制止美英帝国主义干涉黎巴嫩、约旦和威胁中东国家的侵略行为。联合国宪章第一条就规定：联合国的宗旨是“维持国际和平与安全，并为此目的：采取有效的集体措施，以防止和消除对和平的威胁，制止侵略行为或其他破坏和平的行为”。因此，在这个关系到中东国家的主权和独立、关系到中东和世界和平的极端重要的问题上，联合国组织又面临着一次严重的考验。真正爱护联合国宪章原则的国家，都应当促使联合国组织采取坚决的措施来制止美英帝国主义的侵略。而制止美英帝国主义侵略行为的首要步骤，就是要美英侵略军队立即撤出中东。
    美英帝国主义在派遣军队侵占了黎巴嫩和约旦之后，还继续把他们的侵略军队运往中东地区集结。美英帝国主义这样张牙舞爪地进行武装干涉和战争威胁是为了什么呢？事情很清楚，他们不但要霸占黎巴嫩和约旦，而且要用它们作为立足点，来向中东其他国家进行侵略。英国“观察家报”发表的从华盛顿发出的消息中就透露说，杜勒斯和劳埃德已经达成了协议：美英军队不撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，以便“在必要的时候保护其他小国不受渗入的特务和煽动性的电台进行的间接侵略”。而人们知道，美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略，就是在所谓黎巴嫩和约旦遭受了本国人民的“间接侵略”的这种荒谬无耻的借口下进行的。美国总统艾森豪威尔在7月15日的演说中，就把伊拉克人民推翻费萨尔王朝说成是对伊拉克的“间接侵略”。由此可见，美英帝国主义早就为自己准备了扩大侵略、挑起战争的借口。在这种严重万分的局势下面，要求美英侵略军队立即撤出中东，不但是维护联合国宪章的尊严的必要步骤，而且是防止美英帝国主义扩大侵略、挽救世界和平的刻不容缓的措施。
    要求美英侵略军队撤出中东，已成为全世界千千万万的爱好和平和自由的人民的共同呼声。阿联、印度、印度尼西亚、锡兰、苏联、中国、越南民主共和国、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚、波兰、罗马尼亚、蒙古等国都已发表声明，要求美英侵略军队撤出中东。
    同时，这也是黎巴嫩人民、约旦人民和中东其他各国人民的共同意志。美英侵略军队不从中东撤出，中东国家的独立和安全就不能得到保障，中东和世界的和平就必然继续受到美英侵略者的威胁。
    中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都决不容忍美英帝国主义的侵略行为。遭受美英帝国主义侵略威胁的阿拉伯国家和坚决支持阿拉伯人民民族独立斗争的社会主义国家，都已表明了自己的态度，一致要求美英帝国主义立即停止侵略。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界爱好和平的人民反对美英侵略的怒潮，正在继续高涨。美英帝国主义不把他们的侵略军队撤出中东，全世界人民的斗争决不罢休！
