Public Opinion Believes Summit Conference Cannot Be Delayed
Leaders of Asian, African, and Nordic Countries
Agree to Early Summit Conference
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 24th - It is learned here that Indian Prime Minister Nehru has written a letter replying to the letter sent by Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev on the 23rd, agreeing to hold a summit conference within the framework of the Security Council.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 24th - According to Antara News Agency, Indonesian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ali Sastroamidjojo, told reporters in Jakarta on the evening of the 24th that he agreed to hold a summit conference within the United Nations Security Council to overcome the Middle East crisis. Sastroamidjojo said that the United Nations must do everything possible to overcome the Middle East crisis, which seriously threatens world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, 25th - According to the Indian Press Trust, Arab nationalists in Beirut are satisfied with Khrushchev's recent proposal to include representatives of relevant Arab countries in the summit conference held within the framework of the United Nations Security Council.

These people said on the 24th that any resolutions on the Middle East issue made without the participation of Arabs are not binding on Arab countries. Any attempt to make such resolutions without their participation has the stench of a "sphere of influence policy."

Xinhua News Agency, 25th - Washington News: Ghanaian Prime Minister Nkrumah said upon arriving in Washington on the 23rd that he supported holding a summit conference within the framework of the United Nations Security Council and believed that this conference should be held "as soon as possible." Nkrumah will be making a three-day state visit to the United States. Nkrumah delivered a speech at the National Press Club of America on the 24th. Speaking about the Middle East issue, he said that the United Nations should keep the entire Middle East region free from foreign interference, and the major powers should also guarantee the sovereignty of every Middle Eastern country.

Xinhua News Agency, 25th - Oslo News: A Norwegian government spokesman said on the 24th that the Norwegian government hopes that the political and practical obstacles to a high-level meeting that still exist can be resolved, thereby making it possible to hold a high-level meeting within the framework of the Security Council.

The spokesman said: The Norwegian government does not believe that there are insurmountable difficulties hindering high-level talks. He said that some way should be found to prevent the Chiang Kai-shek clique from participating in high-level meetings.

It is reported that the Norwegian government believes that the directly relevant Arab countries—Lebanon, Iraq, and the United Arab Republic—should participate in this meeting.

    各方舆论认为召开首脑会议不容拖延
    亚非北欧一些国家的领袖
    赞同及早开首脑会议
    据新华社新德里24日电　据这里获悉，印度总理尼赫鲁已经写信答复苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在23日发出的关于同意在安理会范围内举行政府首脑会议的信件。
    据新华社雅加达24日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚常驻联合国代表阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约24日晚上在会见雅加达的新闻记者时说，他赞同在联合国安全理事会内召开政府首脑会议来克服中东的危机。沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，联合国必须尽一切办法来克服严重威胁着世界和平的中东危机。
    据新华社25日讯　据印度报业托辣斯报道，贝鲁特的阿拉伯民族主义者对于赫鲁晓夫最近指出的要有关阿拉伯国家的代表参加在联合国安全理事会范围内举行的政府首脑会议的建议表示满意。
    这些人士在24日说，在没有阿拉伯人参加的情况下所作出的关于中东问题的任何决议，对阿拉伯国家都没有约束力。不要他们参加而要作出这样决议的任何企图都带有“势力范围政策”的臭味。
    据新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：加纳总理恩克鲁玛23日到达华盛顿时说，他赞成在联合国安全理事会范围内举行政府首脑会议，而且认为这个会议应当“及早举行”。恩克鲁玛将在美国作三天的国事访问。恩克鲁玛24日在美国全国新闻俱乐部发表演说。他谈到中东问题时说，联合国应当使整个中东地区不受外来干涉，大国也应当保证每一个中东国家的主权。
    新华社25日讯　奥斯陆消息：挪威政府发言人24日说：挪威政府希望现在还存在着的对高级会议的政治和实际的阻碍能够得到解决，从而使在安理会范围内举行高级会议成为可能。
    这位发言人说：挪威政府不认为存在着阻碍高级会谈的不可克服的困难。他说，应该找出一些办法不让蒋介石分子参加高级会议。
    有消息说，挪威政府认为直接有关的阿拉伯国家——黎巴嫩、伊拉克和阿拉伯联合共和国应该参加这个会议。
