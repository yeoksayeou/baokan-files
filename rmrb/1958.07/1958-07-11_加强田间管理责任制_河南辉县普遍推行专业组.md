Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 10th: In order to strengthen autumn field management and strive for a bumper autumn harvest, agricultural cooperatives in Huixian County, Henan Province, have universally implemented a responsibility system of specialized groups for managing crops by category.

Based on the implementation of the system of contracting work and production to households in various agricultural cooperatives, this county implemented the responsibility system of specialized groups managing crops by category in the spring of this year. According to the specific conditions of each cooperative and production team, specialized management groups for crops such as cotton, rice, sweet potatoes, and corn were established, responsible for all agricultural tasks such as cultivating, weeding, watering, fertilizing, pest control, and other technical management, implementing specialization to the group, responsibility to the household, and work points recorded by the cooperative team after acceptance. Statistics by the end of June showed that 388 agricultural cooperatives in the county had implemented this system, accounting for 76.5% of the total number of cooperatives, establishing a total of 5,166 specialized groups for cotton, rice, sweet potatoes, corn, and other crops. Due to the strengthening of the field specialized management responsibility system, the autumn seedlings throughout the county this year have been managed very well, basically achieving the "four no's" requirement of no missing seedlings, no yellowing and thinness, no pests, and no weeds.

Practice has proved that the implementation of the responsibility system of specialized groups managing crops by category in Huixian agricultural cooperatives has four major benefits: First, it can strengthen the responsibility of cooperative members and ensure that various agricultural tasks in the field are completed on schedule according to plan. It also facilitates labor competitions between groups and organizes visits and comparisons. Second, managing by category of crops allows cooperative members to specifically grasp the changes and growth conditions of various crops in various stages of the growth process from planting to harvesting, so as to promote the enthusiasm of cooperative members in learning and studying agricultural technology. Third, it can fully leverage the labor enthusiasm and technical expertise of cooperative members according to their different technical and physical conditions, and improve labor efficiency. Fourth, specialized groups have dedicated leaders, and labor is specialized, which can overcome the lack of in-depth and specific leadership and the chaotic situation in the use of labor. While establishing crop-based management systems, many cooperatives have also established water conservancy and manure accumulation professional teams and production commando teams, specifically responsible for perennial water conservancy, manure accumulation, and seasonal shock production tasks.

    加强田间管理责任制
    河南辉县普遍推行专业组
    据新华社郑州10日电　为了加强秋田管理，争取秋季大丰收，河南省辉县各农业社普遍推行了专业组分系管理农作物的责任制度。
    这个县在各个农业社实行包工包产制度的基础上，今年春季就推行了专业组分系管理农作物的责任制度。根据各社、生产队的具体情况，建立棉花、水稻、红薯、玉米等作物专业管理组，负责中耕、除草、浇水、施肥、除虫以及其他技术管理等全部农活，实行专业到组、责任到户、社队验收记工分。到6月底统计，全县实行这种制度的已有三百八十八个农业社，占总社数的76.5％，共建立棉花、水稻、红薯、玉米等专业组五千一百六十六个。由于加强了田间专业管理责任制，今年全县秋苗管理得非常好，基本上达到了无缺苗、无黄瘦、无虫害、无杂草的“四无”要求。
    实践证明，辉县农业社实行专业组分系管理农作物的责任制有四大好处：一、可加强社员的责任制，保证田间各种农活按时完成计划。而且还便于组与组开展劳动竞赛，组织参观评比。二、按作物分系管理，可以使社员从种到收具体掌握各种作物在生长过程中各个时期的变化和生长情况，以促进社员学习钻研农业技术的积极性。三、可以根据各人不同的技术、体力条件，充分发挥社员的劳动积极性和技术专长，提高劳动效率。四、专业小组有专人领导，劳力专业化，可以克服领导不深入、不具体和劳动力使用上的混乱情况。许多社在建立农作物分系管理的同时，还建立了水利、积肥专业队和生产突击队，专门担负常年的水利、积肥和季节性的突击生产任务。
