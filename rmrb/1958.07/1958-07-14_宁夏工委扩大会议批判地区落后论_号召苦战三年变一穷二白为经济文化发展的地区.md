(Via our Yinchuan dispatch) The enlarged meeting of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party concluded on the 8th. The meeting conveyed the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, and based on the Party's general line for socialist construction, decided to wage a hard struggle for three years to completely change the face of the impoverished and blank Ningxia region.

Inspired by the general line for socialist construction and enlightened by Chairman Mao's call to "break down superstition and liberate thought," the participants in the meeting received a profound Marxist-Leninist education, enhanced their communist consciousness, and the entire meeting was filled with the revolutionary heroism and optimism of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced. The meeting repeatedly criticized right-leaning conservative thoughts such as the so-called "pessimism" and "backwardness theory" which claimed that "the foundation of the Ningxia region is poor, the conditions are not good, the masses' awareness is low, and the situation is special." They pointed out that the Ningxia region is indeed a "poor and blank" region, but at the same time, it is also a region rich in resources and with superior conditions, and that all Communist Party members and the vast numbers of Hui and Han people in the region have great potential in building socialism. They expressed their firm belief that the call made by the Working Committee to wage a hard struggle for three years to change the face of the Ningxia region is correct.

The attendees, with steel, iron, machinery, and grain as the focus, repeatedly revised the planned targets and measures.

The meeting believed that the key to ensuring the completion of the leap forward plan lies in tightly grasping the measures, and that the next battle should be organized immediately before the end of one battle. In agriculture, in addition to doing everything possible to strive for a complete victory in this year's bumper harvest, preparations should be made immediately to strive for an even greater bumper harvest next year.

The meeting believed that "politics is the commander, and ideology is the soul" is an unquestionable truth and must be implemented in all work. The general line for socialist construction must truly become the beacon of all work. Constant and unremitting struggles must be waged against all kinds of right-leaning conservative thoughts. First of all, the Party's leadership over all work must be strengthened, and the system of individual responsibility under the collective leadership of the Party committee must be adhered to; the fraternal unity of the Hui and Han nationalities must be strengthened, and localism and local nationalism must continue to be opposed, as well as all thoughts and behaviors that undermine national unity and undermine the common interests of socialism. It is necessary to plant red flags and pull out white flags everywhere, establish the ideological advantage of communism on all fronts, and make all ethnic groups more closely united around the Party, advancing together towards socialism. The meeting also pointed out that the entire Party must be mobilized to study Marxism-Leninism, especially Chairman Mao's works and his noble style, to break down superstition and liberate thought. A new fashion of boldly innovating and creating, and not fearing difficulties, must be established among the entire people.

    宁夏工委扩大会议批判地区落后论
    号召苦战三年变一穷二白为经济文化发展的地区
    本报银川电　中共宁夏回族自治区工作委员会扩大会议已经在8日闭幕。会议传达了“八大”二次会议精神，并且根据党的社会主义建设总路线，决定要苦战三年，把一穷二白的宁夏地区全部改变面貌。
    参加会议的人在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，在毛主席“破除迷信、解放思想”的启示下，都受到了一次极为深刻的马克思列宁主义教育，提高了共产主义觉悟，整个会议充满了学先进赶先进超先进的革命英雄主义和乐观主义精神。会议反复地批判了所谓“宁夏地区基础差、条件不好、群众觉悟低、情况特殊”的“悲观论”和“落后论”等右倾保守思想。他们指出，宁夏地区确是一个“又穷又白”的地区，但同时又是资源丰富、条件优越的地区，全体共产党员和全区广大回汉人民在建设社会主义事业上大有可为。他们表示坚信工委提出的苦战三年、改变宁夏地区面貌的号召是正确的。
    出席会议的人都以钢、铁、机械、粮食为重点，反复地修订了计划指标和措施。
    会议认为，保证完成跃进计划的关键在于紧紧地抓住措施，在一个战役未结束前即开始组织下一个战役，在农业上除了千方百计争取今年丰收的全胜外，目前即应立即作好准备争取明年更大的丰收。
    会议认为，“政治是统帅，思想是灵魂”是不容怀疑的真理，必须贯彻到一切工作中去。真正地使社会主义建设的总路线成为各项工作的灯塔。经常向各种各样的右倾保守思想进行不懈的斗争。首先要加强党对一切工作的领导，坚持党委集体领导下的个人负责制；加强回、汉民族的兄弟团结，继续反对地方主义和地方民族主义，反对破坏民族团结、破坏社会主义共同利益的一切思想和行为。要到处插红旗，拔白旗，在各个战线上树立起共产主义思想优势，使各族人民更加紧密地团结在党的周围，共同向社会主义前进。会议还指出，必须发动全党学习马列主义，特别是毛主席的著作和他的高尚风格，破除迷信，解放思想。在全民中树立起大胆革新创造，不畏艰难的新风尚。
