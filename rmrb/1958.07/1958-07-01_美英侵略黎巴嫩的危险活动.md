The U.S. and British imperialist plot to intervene militarily in Lebanon's internal affairs has become increasingly clear. Peace in the Middle East and the national independence of Arab countries are once again facing a serious threat. This cannot but concern the people of the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa, who uphold peace and justice. On June 29, the spokesman of the Information Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the Chinese people are very concerned about the development of the situation in Lebanon. The Chinese government and people have always supported the struggle of the Lebanese people and all Arab people against imperialism and colonialism. The Chinese government believes that any U.S. and British interference in Lebanon's internal affairs is absolutely not allowed.

Since the Lebanese people launched their struggle against imperialism and its agents, U.S. and British imperialism have not ceased their interference in Lebanon. They have continuously transported various weapons and ammunition to the Chamoun government and dispatched a large number of military personnel to assist the Chamoun army in attacking the Lebanese people. But this was not enough. Not long ago, the U.S. President and the British Prime Minister held talks, and discussed a joint adventurous plan to invade Lebanon. Subsequently, the United States and Britain stepped up the deployment of troops and conducted military deployments. The United States placed warships of the Sixth Fleet on the sea near Lebanon and increased the strength of the Marine Corps belonging to this fleet. Britain airlifted a large number of paratroopers, artillery, and other arms to Cyprus, where tens of thousands of troops were assembled. At the same time, under the direction of the United States and Britain, the military machine of the Baghdad Pact was also activated. Large numbers of Iraqi and Jordanian troops are concentrating in military bases in northern Jordan, such as Mafraq. Some Iraqi and Jordanian military personnel have already entered Lebanon. On June 23, the Prime Minister of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation, Said, suddenly ran to London to "discuss any possibility of Western intervention in Lebanon." (Associated Press, London) These facts are sufficient to prove that U.S. and British imperialism and their followers are preparing to carry out armed intervention in Lebanon.

Whenever imperialism invades others, it always creates various "legitimate" reasons to disguise itself. For this reason, U.S. and British imperialism are trying every means to steal the banner of the United Nations. Recently, they instructed the Chamoun government to request the United Nations to send "international forces" to Lebanon. At the same time, they echoed each other and expressed their "full support" for "any suggestions" from the United Nations on the Lebanese issue. Some U.S. senators even publicly demanded that the United Nations take "police action" in Lebanon, "as the United Nations did in Korea in the past." The conspiracy of the U.S. ruling group is clearly revealed on paper. They are shamelessly admitting that they want to move the set of methods used to invade Korea to Lebanon. In the eyes of U.S. and British interventionists, everything is ready now, except for uniforms and badges. Their wishful thinking is that it would be best to let the soldiers on the Sixth Fleet warships and in the Cyprus barracks put on the UN uniform first, and then attack the Lebanese people.

Naturally, imperialists, in addition to having methods for invading Korea, also have methods for invading Egypt. They believe that if they really can't get the UN flag, they can still invade. In this regard, U.S. and British imperialism and their agents have also made preparations. Lebanese Prime Minister Solh recently clamored that "if the United Nations fails to take action quickly enough," he will directly request the United States and Britain to send troops to intervene. This echoes Dulles' statement not long ago about the United States' readiness to send troops to Lebanon. But whether it is the method of invading Korea or the method of invading Egypt, the invaders have been bloodied. The imperialist warmongers are so forgetful of the painful lessons they have suffered!

Any excuse for the United States to attempt armed intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs is untenable. On June 25, U.S. State Department spokesman White stated that the United States' "support" for UN intervention in the Lebanese situation seemed to be to "safeguard Lebanon's independence." This is even more nonsense. The Lebanese people's uprising against imperialism and its agents is precisely to defend their national independence. Their firm opposition to the pro-Western Chamoun government is precisely because this government has betrayed national interests. Whatever action the Lebanese people take to fight the Chamoun government is Lebanon's internal affair. And the UN Charter clearly stipulates that the United Nations shall not intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state. Therefore, U.S. and British imperialism have no right to demand that the United Nations interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs. If U.S. and British imperialism intervene directly, it will further prove that they are not only destroyers of UN principles, but also the most ferocious enemies of Arab nationalism.

At present, the Lebanese people's struggle against imperialism and its agents is a manifestation of the further intensification of the contradiction between the national independence movement in the Middle East and the imperialist colonial forces. In order to suppress the entire national independence movement in the Middle East, imperialism is trying to stifle the Lebanese people's forces against imperialism and colonialism. The "Washington Post" wrote: The United States' determination to assist the Chamoun government is "strategically important." The "strategy" mentioned here is the entire colonial plan of U.S. imperialism in the Middle East. The reason why the United States and Britain collude to prepare for a joint invasion of Lebanon is to compete for their colonial sphere of influence in Lebanon and even the entire Middle East. But this is not the whole problem. The imperialists, especially the United States, are preparing to play with fire in Lebanon, which is also closely related to its war policy. In order to alleviate the increasingly deepening economic crisis, the U.S. ruling group is looking for opportunities to intensify tensions in some parts of the world. According to the Associated Press, Eisenhower recently discussed the issue of "small wars" with "senior defense leaders" in the United States, and also talked about the situation in the Middle East. This is no accident.

However, no matter what excuses the U.S. and British imperialists and their followers make, what opportunities they use, or what methods they adopt, if they dare to intervene militarily in Lebanon's internal affairs, it will be a serious act of aggression against the Lebanese people and all Arab peoples, and a provocation to the people of the world and the cause of peace. The Lebanese people have repeatedly stated that they oppose any U.S. and British intervention using the United Nations, and will resolutely resist U.S. and British interventionists. Peace-loving countries and people all over the world cannot ignore this dangerous activity of the United States and Britain that threatens peace. We believe that as long as the Lebanese people closely unite around the patriotic and democratic forces, resolutely expose and combat the conspiracies of imperialist interventionists, their struggle will surely be victorious.

### 美英侵略黎巴嫩的危险活动

    美英侵略黎巴嫩的危险活动
    美英帝国主义阴谋武装干涉黎巴嫩内政的活动，已经越来越明显。中近东的和平和阿拉伯各国人民的民族独立，又一次遭受到严重的威胁。这不能不引起维护和平和正义的全世界人民尤其是亚非人民的关切。6月29日，我国外交部新闻司发言人指出：中国人民非常关心黎巴嫩局势的发展。中国政府和人民一向支持黎巴嫩人民和全体阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。中国政府认为，美英对黎巴嫩内政进行任何干涉，都是绝对不能容许的。
    自从黎巴嫩人民展开反对帝国主义及其代理人的斗争以来，美英帝国主义就没有停止过对黎巴嫩的干涉活动。他们源源不断地向夏蒙政府运送了各种武器和弹药，并且派遣了大批军事人员援助夏蒙军队进攻黎巴嫩人民。但是，这还不够。不久以前美国总统和英国首相举行会谈，更商讨了共同侵略黎巴嫩的冒险计划。接着，美英两国就加紧调兵遣将，进行军事部署。美国把第六舰队的军舰摆在黎巴嫩附近的海面，并且增加了属于这个舰队的海军陆战队的兵力。英国则向塞浦路斯空运大批伞兵、炮兵和其他兵种，在那里集结了几万的部队。同时，在美英的指使下，巴格达集团的军事机器也开动起来了。伊拉克和约旦的大批部队正在约旦北部的军事基地麦法拉克等地集中。有一部分伊拉克和约旦的军事人员早已进入黎巴嫩。6月23日，伊约联邦首相赛义德并且突然跑到伦敦，“讨论西方干涉黎巴嫩的任何可能性”。（美联社伦敦电）这些事实足够证明，美英帝国主义及其追随者正在准备向黎巴嫩进行武装干涉。
    每当帝国主义侵略别人的时候，它总要制造种种“合法的”理由来掩饰自己。就是为了这个原故，美英帝国主义正在想尽办法盗用联合国的旗帜。最近他们指使夏蒙政府出来请求联合国派遣“国际部队”到黎巴嫩去。同时他们就一唱一和地表示将“全力支持”联合国对黎巴嫩问题的“任何建议”。美国某些参议员甚至公开要求联合国对黎巴嫩采取“警察行动”，像过去联合国“在朝鲜所采取的那样”。美国统治集团的阴谋，跃然纸上，他们竟恬不知耻地招认要把侵略朝鲜的一套办法搬到黎巴嫩去了。在美英干涉者看来，现在已经万事具备，只欠制服和徽章而已。他们的如意的算盘是，最好让那些在第六舰队军舰上和塞浦路斯兵营里的士兵能够先穿上联合国的外衣，然后就向黎巴嫩人民进攻。
    自然，帝国主义者除了有侵略朝鲜的办法，还有侵略埃及的办法。他们认为，如果实在弄不到联合国的旗帜，也照样可以侵略。在这方面，美英帝国主义及其代理人也作了准备。黎巴嫩总理索勒哈最近叫嚷说，“如果联合国未能足够快地采取行动”，他就要直接请求美英出兵干涉。这同不久以前杜勒斯关于美国准备派兵到黎巴嫩的声明，是互相呼应的。但是，不论是侵略朝鲜的办法也好，或者是侵略埃及的办法也好，侵略者都碰得头破血流。帝国主义好战分子对于自己所遭受的惨痛教训竟然如此健忘！
    美国企图武装干涉黎巴嫩内政的任何借口，都是站不住脚的。6月25日，美国国务院发言人怀特声明说，美国“支持”联合国干预黎巴嫩的局势似乎是为了“维护黎巴嫩的独立”。这更是胡说八道。黎巴嫩人民起来反对帝国主义及其代理人，正是为了捍卫自己的民族独立。他们坚决反对亲西方的夏蒙政府，正是因为这个政府背叛了民族利益。黎巴嫩人民不论采取什么行动同夏蒙政府进行斗争，都是黎巴嫩的内政。而联合国宪章明明规定，联合国不得干涉本质上属于任何国家内部的事务。因此，美英帝国主义根本无权要求联合国干涉黎巴嫩的内政。如果美英帝国主义直接进行干涉，那就更加证明了他们不仅是联合国原则的破坏者，而且是阿拉伯民族主义的最凶恶的敌人。
    目前黎巴嫩人民反对帝国主义及其代理人的斗争，是中近东民族独立运动同帝国主义殖民势力之间的矛盾进一步尖锐化的表现。帝国主义为了镇压整个中近东的民族独立运动，就力图扼杀黎巴嫩人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的力量。“华盛顿邮报”曾写道：美国决心援助夏蒙政府，这“在战略上是重要的”。这里所说的“战略”就是美帝国主义在中近东的整个殖民计划。美英所以勾结起来准备共同侵略黎巴嫩，也就是想争夺它们在黎巴嫩以至整个中近东的殖民势力范围。但是，这还不是问题的全部。帝国主义者特别是美国准备在黎巴嫩玩火，也是同它的战争政策有密切关系的。为了缓和日益深刻化的经济危机，美国统治集团正想寻找机会在世界上某个地区加剧紧张局势。据美联社报道，艾森豪威尔最近曾同美国“高级国防领袖”讨论了“小规模战争”问题，同时还谈到中东局势。这并不是偶然的。
    但是，不论美英帝国主义及其追随者制造什么借口，利用什么时机，采取什么方式，如果他们胆敢武装干涉黎巴嫩内政，那就是对黎巴嫩人民和所有阿拉伯各国人民的严重的侵略行为，就是对全世界人民和和平事业的挑衅。黎巴嫩人民已经一再表示，他们反对美英利用联合国进行任何干涉活动，并且将坚决反抗美英干涉者。全世界爱好和平的国家和人民都不能对美英这种威胁和平的危险活动置之不顾。我们相信，只要黎巴嫩人民紧密地团结在爱国民主力量的周围，坚决揭露和打击帝国主义干涉者的阴谋活动，他们的斗争是一定能够胜利的。
