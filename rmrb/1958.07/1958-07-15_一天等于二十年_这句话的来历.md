    The Origin of the Phrase "One Day Equals Twenty Years"
    Some readers have written to inquire: Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report at the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party that "Marx predicted that the proletarian revolution would lead us into a great era when 'one day would equal twenty years'," where does Marx's statement come from? The answer is as follows.
    Marx's statement comes from a letter he wrote to Engels in April 1863. This statement by Marx was later quoted by Lenin in the article "Karl Marx" in the section on strategy.
    Marx's statement was derived from Engels' early work, "The Condition of the Working Class in England," so it is necessary to briefly discuss this book.
    In his book "The Condition of the Working Class in England," written in 1844-1845, Engels predicted that an economic crisis would break out in England in 1847, followed by a socialist revolution, and the working class would become the true ruler of England (see "The Complete Works of Marx and Engels," Volume 2, People's Publishing House, pages 524 and 527). The prediction of the economic crisis in 1847 came true accurately, but a socialist revolution did not follow in England. Instead, bourgeois revolutions occurred in several other European countries. This was determined by many reasons.
    "The Condition of the Working Class in England" is one of the finest works in world socialist literature. Engels took the most developed country at the time, England, as an example, and collected extremely rich specific facts, statistics, and other important materials to explain a series of laws of capitalist production. Marx attached great importance to this work and cited these materials in his book "Capital." Furthermore, Marx pointed out: "How profoundly Engels understood the spirit of the capitalist mode of production is confirmed by the factory reports, mine reports, etc., published since 1845. A superficial comparison of his work with the 'Children's Employment Commission Reports' (1863-1867), published eighteen or twenty years later, is enough to show how accurate his account was." ("Capital," People's Publishing House edition, Volume 1, page 272)
    Here, Marx explains that the events Engels described twenty years ago were confirmed by facts and officially published materials in the twenty years that followed. However, during this period, many anti-communist elements and philistines in revolutionary parties in Europe, including Germany, ridiculed Engels' predictions, saying that Engels' book had been published for twenty years, but the socialist revolution predicted in the book had not occurred.
    On April 9, 1863, Marx wrote to Engels about this issue: "Whether the English workers will soon free themselves from their apparently bourgeois corruption remains to be seen. Moreover, as for the main points of your book, all further developments since 1844 have confirmed them, down to the smallest detail. I have just re-examined your book in comparison with my notes from a later period. Only the petty, narrow-minded German philistine, who measures the history of the world with a small ruler and discusses it according to the latest 'newspaper trivia,' would think that twenty years is more than a day in this great historical development, although the day will come when twenty years of change will be concentrated into one day." (See "Collected Correspondence of Marx and Engels," Sanlian Bookstore, Volume 3, pages 155-156; the translation here has been proofread by the Compilation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.)
    Here Marx is saying that after the publication of Engels' book "The Condition of the Working Class in England," that is, after Engels made the prediction that a socialist revolution would occur in England, although twenty years had passed, due to various reasons, world events had not developed significantly in these twenty years, some places may have even stagnated, perhaps twenty years were only equal to one day. However, only petty philistines and revolutionary mediocrities would think that twenty years is more than a day, and they should know that the day will come when one day is equal to twenty years.
    Fifty years later, Lenin, in his article "Karl Marx," quoted Marx's words, expressing this meaning in a vivid and easy-to-understand form: "Twenty years are equal to one day in a great historical period, although later there may be a period when one day is equal to twenty years." Lenin further pointed out: "At each stage of development, at each moment, the proletariat's tactics should take into account this objective and inevitable dialectic of human history, on the one hand, to use the era of political depression or the so-called 'peaceful' slow development to develop the advanced class's consciousness, strength, and fighting ability, and on the other hand, to carry out this work entirely with the aim of achieving the 'ultimate goal' of this class movement, and to cultivate in this class the ability to practically solve great tasks in the great period when 'one day is equal to twenty years'." (Lenin: "On Marx, Engels, and Marxism," People's Publishing House, page 42)
    Currently, under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people, after the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, have shown unprecedented political enthusiasm and labor activism, promoting social productive forces to develop forward at an unprecedented high speed. Especially after the promulgation of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the enthusiasm of the broad masses has become even higher, and the socialist construction cause is advancing by leaps and bounds. It is entirely foreseeable that, in a few years, our country will be able to leave Britain far behind and enter the ranks of the most advanced and powerful countries in the world. Therefore, Comrade Liu Shaoqi quoted the phrase "one day equals twenty years" in his report as a portrayal of this great era.

### “一天等于二十年”这句话的来历

    “一天等于二十年”这句话的来历
    有些读者来信询问：刘少奇同志在党的八届二次会议的报告中说，“马克思预言过，无产阶级革命将使我们进入‘会有一天等于二十年’的伟大时期”，马克思的这句话出在什么地方？现在答复如下。
    马克思的这句话出在他1863年4月写给恩格斯的信中。马克思的这句话后来曾被列宁引用在“卡尔·马克思”一文中讲策略的一节。
    马克思的这句话是从恩格斯早年的著作“英国工人阶级状况”引起来的，所以需要简单地说一下这部书。
    恩格斯在他1844至1845年所作的“英国工人阶级状况”一书里预言1847年英国将爆发经济危机，在经济危机之后将发生社会主义革命，工人阶级将成为英国真正的统治者（见“马克思恩格斯全集”，第二卷，人民出版社出版，五二四和五二七页）。关于1847年的经济危机的预言是准确地实现了，但是接着并没有在英国发生社会主义革命，而是在欧洲的其他几个国家发生了资产阶级性质的革命。这是由许多原因决定的。
    “英国工人阶级状况”是世界社会主义文献中最优秀的著作之一。恩格斯拿当时最发达的英国为例，搜集了极为丰富的具体事实和统计数字等重要资料，阐明了资本主义生产的一系列的规律。马克思很重视这部著作，在他所著的“资本论”里曾引证这些材料。并且，马克思指出：“恩格斯对于资本主义生产方式的精神的了解，曾是怎样精深，是由1845以来公布的工厂报告、矿山报告等等所证实了。最表面地把他的著作和十八年后二十年后发表的‘童工委员会报告’（1863年至1867年）比较一下，已经可以知道，他的记述是怎样妥当。”（“资本论”，人民出版社版，第一卷，二七二页）
    在这里，马克思说明恩格斯在二十年前所记述的事情，在二十年中都是被事实和官方公布的材料所证实了的。但是，这时期欧洲，包括德国在内，有许多反对共产主义的分子和革命政党中的庸人，嘲笑恩格斯的预言，说恩格斯的著作已经发表二十年了，可是书中所预言的社会主义革命并没有发生。
    1863年4月9日，马克思在写给恩格斯的信里这样地说到这个问题：“英国工人是否很快就要从他们显然是资产阶级的腐化状态中解脱出来，未来就会显示给我们看。此外，至于你的书中的主要之点，那末所有一直，直到最微细的事情，都由1844年之后的进一步的发展证实了。我刚才又把你的书同我后一时期的笔记重新对照了一下。只有用小尺来量全世界历史并且根据最近‘报纸上的趣闻’来议论全世界历史的德国鄙陋的小市民才会以为，在这种伟大的历史发展中二十年比一天多，虽然将来会有一天之中集中着二十年变化的日子来到。”（参看“马克思恩格斯通信集”，三联书店出版，第三卷，一五五至一五六页；这里的译文经中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局作了校订。）
    这里马克思是说，在恩格斯的“英国工人阶级状况”一书出版后，也就是恩格斯作了英国将发生社会主义革命的预言之后，虽然过去二十年了，但是这二十年由于种种原因，世界的事变并没有很大的发展，有些地方也许还在原地踏步，也许二十年只能等于一天。不过，只有鄙陋的小市民们，革命的庸人们才以为二十年比一天多，要知道，将有一天抵得上二十年的日子来到。
    五十年后，列宁在“卡尔·马克思”一文中引用马克思的这几句话，用生动易解的形式表述了这个意思：“二十年等于伟大历史发展时期的一天，虽然后来也许会有一天等于二十年的时期”。列宁并且指出：“在每个发展阶段上，在每个时机内，无产阶级底策略应估计到人类历史这个客观必然的辩证律，一方面要利用政治消沉时代或所谓‘和平的’迟缓发展时代来发展先进阶级底意识、力量和战斗能力，另一方面在进行这种利用工作时完全要以达到这个阶级运动底‘终极目的’，并在这个阶级中养成能在‘一天等于二十年’的伟大时期实际解决伟大任务的本事为主旨。”（列宁：“论马克思恩格斯及马克思主义”，人民出版社出版，四二页）
    目前，我国人民在党的领导下，经过了经济、政治和思想战线上的社会主义革命，表现了空前的政治热情和劳动积极性，推动着社会生产力以史无前例的高速度向前发展。特别是在党的社会主义建设总路线公布以后，广大群众的干劲更加高涨，社会主义建设事业一日千里。完全可以预料，不消若干年后，我们的国家就可以把英国远远地抛在后面，进入世界最先进和最强大的国家的行列。因此，刘少奇同志在他的报告中引用“一天等于二十年”这句话来作为这个伟大时期的写照。
