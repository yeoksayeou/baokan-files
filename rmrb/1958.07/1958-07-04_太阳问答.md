During the Great Leap Forward, there was a folk song asking the sun questions, which was very interesting.

It said the sun was lazy, getting up too late; at night, the sky doesn't get dark, and it knocks off work too early.

Therefore, the farmers in the Great Leap Forward challenged the sun, asking it to compete and see who was more diligent.

I drafted a reply for the sun and also had the moon and stars participate in the debate.

Finally, the farmers expressed their gratitude, and the sun, moon, stars, and farmers sang in unison, filling the sky and the earth with red flags. (June 21, 1958)

    Farmer:
    Sun, sun, I ask you,
    Do you dare to compete with me?
    We've been working for half a day,
    But you sleep in and get up late.
    We only come back in the dark,
    But you knock off early and go back underground.
    Sun, sun, I ask you,
    Do you dare to compete with me?

    Sun:
    Comrade, comrade, you ask well,
    I raise both hands in surrender.
    Because I have to run to the West,
    That's why you don't see me for half a day.
    The situation in the West is terrible,
    The lazy ones just fool around.
    Catching up with England, fifteen years is unnecessary,
    Comrade, comrade, I dare to guarantee.

    Moon:
    Comrade, comrade, you ask correctly,
    When the sun goes down, I lead the team.
    You've wronged the sun,
    It doesn't sleep at night.
    At night, I'm allowed to hold the lantern,
    But the light is still its light.
    But comrade, you ask correctly,
    We shouldn't do things slowly, poorly, wastefully.

    Stars:
    Comrade, comrade, you ask strangely,
    The stars smile when they hear it.
    We are very far apart,
    But our relationship is very close.
    We're with the sun during the day,
    We're inseparable from the moon at night.
    Although our light is not great,
    We shine on you day and night.

    Farmer:
    Sun, stars, and moon,
    Your words cheer my heart.
    I wronged the sun,
    Its smile is so generous!
    Thank you for your light and heat,
    Everywhere the yield per mu has increased.
    Wheat has already reached 5,000 jin per mu,
    Thank you, and thank the Party.

    Chorus:
    Thank the Party, ah, thank the Party,
    The Party is the never-setting red sun.
    The East wind will always prevail over the West wind,
    Socialism shines brightly.
    Go all out and aim high,
    Build a paradise quickly, well, and economically.
    Let the red flag be planted all over the world,
    Let the red flag be planted on the top of the sky.

    太阳问答
    郭沫若
    大跃进中有一首民歌是问太阳的，很有意思。
    它说太阳睡懒觉，起来得太迟；晚上天不见黑，又收工得太早。
    因此，大跃进中的农民向太阳挑战；要他来比赛一下，看谁更勤快一些。
    我替太阳拟了回答，又让月亮和星星也参加了辩论。
    最后是农民表示谢意，日月星农齐声合唱，使天上地下插遍红旗。　（1958年6月21日）
    农民：
    太阳太阳我问你，
    敢不敢来比一比？
    我们出工老半天，
    你睡懒觉迟迟起。
    我们摸黑才回来，
    你早收工进地里。
    太阳太阳我问你，
    敢不敢来比一比？
    太阳：
    同志同志你问得好，
    我举起双手投降了。
    我因为要朝西方跑，
    故有半天你见不到。
    西方的情况真糟糕，
    不劳动的人光胡闹。
    超英，十五年不需要，
    同志同志我敢担保。
    月亮：
    同志同志你问得对，
    太阳下山，我来带队。
    你可把太阳错怪了，
    他在夜里并没有睡。
    夜里让我来打灯笼，
    光辉还是他的光辉。
    但是同志你问得对，
    是不该少慢而差费。
    星星：
    同志同志你问得奇，
    星星听了都笑眯眯。
    我们相隔得太远了，
    但我们的关系很亲密。
    白日和太阳在一道，
    夜晚和月亮不分离。
    虽然我们的光不大，
    白日黑夜都照着你。
    农民：
    太阳星星和月亮，
    你们的话儿开心肠。
    我把太阳错怪了，
    他的一笑多大方！
    感谢你们的光和热，
    处处都提高了亩产量。
    小麦已亩产五千斤，
    感谢你们，并感谢党。
    合唱：
    感谢党呵感谢党，
    党是不落的红太阳。
    东风永把西风压，
    社会主义放光芒。
    鼓足干劲争上游，
    多快好省建天堂。
    红旗插遍全世界，
    红旗插在天顶上。
