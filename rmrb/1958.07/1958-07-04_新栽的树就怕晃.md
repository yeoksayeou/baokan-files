    "Newly Planted Trees Are Most Afraid of Shaking"
    In the morning, I was hurrying to work when I carelessly knocked over an old woman's vegetables in front of a vegetable shop. I quickly bent down to pick up the scattered greens, repeatedly saying sorry.
    The old woman didn't pick up the vegetables and didn't pay attention to me. I looked up and saw her holding the small tree beside the road, which I had bumped and was swaying back and forth, with both hands, muttering to herself, "Newly planted trees are most afraid of shaking."
    From that day on, I deeply cherished the small trees in Beijing and did my best to protect them: watering the small tree in front of the door, tying up supports, and calling naughty children away from the saplings...

    “新栽的树就怕晃”
    早上，我匆匆忙忙地赶着去上班，在一家菜铺门口，不留心把一个老太太的菜碰撒了。我赶忙弯下身来拾撒在地上的青菜，嘴里连声说对不起。
    老太太不来拾菜，也不理我。我抬头一看，她正用两只手抓着路旁那棵叫我撞得来回摇摆的小树，自言自语的说：“新栽的树就怕晃”。
    从那天起，我深切地爱护着北京城的小树，尽自己的力量保护它：给门前的小树浇水，绑支架，把淘气的孩子从幼苗旁叫开……
