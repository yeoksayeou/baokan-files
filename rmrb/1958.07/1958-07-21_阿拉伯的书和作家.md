Arab Books and Writers
谷际之

    I saw a letter from a reader in the supplement of the People's Daily requesting the publication of more Arab literature and art, and this request is correct. I would like to briefly introduce what I know about Arab literary and artistic works in recent years.

    After World War II, the political consciousness of the people of Arab countries greatly increased. A large number of new writers also emerged in the anti-imperialist struggle. Most of these writers have close ties with the masses and focus on the lives of farmers, workers, and intellectuals. Their works address major issues such as how to eliminate political and economic dependence on imperialism and rapidly improve people's lives.

    Valuable works published in the past few years include the Egyptian poet and writer Rahman's "Land" and the Syrian writer Hanna Juna's "Blue Lamp." The story of "Blue Lamp" takes place in Latakia, a coastal city in Syria during the war. The residents of the city's suburbs are fishermen, clerks, and unemployed people, who are on the verge of starvation. The colonial government severely suppressed the resisters. However, the Syrian people's desire for independence cannot be suppressed. The book ends with a huge demonstration demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops. Some progressive Arab critics believe that "Land" and "Blue Lamp" mark an important stage in the development of modern Arab prose.

    In addition, some novels are also popular with readers, such as the Syrian writer Marwaz's "Scarf" and the Lebanese writer Ablaxin Dakrus's "Night."

    The development of the national independence movement in the past few years has also been reflected in the works of Arab writers. For example, "New Street" written by Ka is one example. The novel narrates the time from before World War I to the armed demonstrations in Egypt in 1952 demanding the withdrawal of British troops.

    The Arab Writers Union was established at the first Arab Progressive Writers Conference held in Damascus in 1954. The slogan of the alliance is "Develop free thinking and strive for a bright future," which reflects the common aspirations of literary and art workers in Arab countries.

    In 1955, many publishing houses were established in Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, and many books were published. For example, Annadin Publishing House published a collection of Syrian, Lebanese, and Iraqi literature. Lebanon also issued the following periodicals in 1955: "Freedom," "Road," "Flame," "Voice of the Century," etc.

    The works reflecting the lives and struggles of the Arab people published by our Writers Publishing House include "Collection of Arab Short Stories," "Collection of Egyptian Short Stories," and the Lebanese writer George Hanna's novel "The Priest of the Church," etc. Forthcoming publications include the Iraqi writer Muhammad Rashid's reportage "From the Depths of Iraqi Prisons," the poetry collection "The Voice of the Arab People," as well as "Collection of Persian Short Stories," and "Egyptian Short Stories" (Volume 2), etc.

    阿拉伯的书和作家
    谷际之
    在人民日报副刊上看到读者要求多多出版阿拉伯文学艺术作品的来信，这要求是正确的。我现在把我所了解的近年来阿拉伯文艺作品的情况，简单介绍给大家。
    在第二次世界大战后，阿拉伯国家人民的政治觉悟大大地提高了。大批的新作家也在反帝斗争中涌现出来了。这些作家大部分都和群众有着紧密的联系，都以农民、工人和知识分子的生活为主题。他们的作品所涉及的有像如何消灭在政治上和经济上对帝国主义的依赖和迅速地改善人民生活等这些重大的问题。
    过去几年中所出版的有价值的作品，有埃及诗人和作家拉赫曼的“土地”和叙利亚作家汉拿·朱纳的“蓝灯”。“蓝灯”的故事发生在战争时期叙利亚沿海一个城市拉塔基亚，这个城市的郊区居民是渔民、职员和失业者，他们濒于饥饿的境况。殖民地政府予反抗者严厉的镇压。但是叙利亚人民要求独立的愿望是镇压不了的。这本书是以要求外国军队撤退的巨大示威场面而结束。阿拉伯的一些进步评论家认为，“土地”和“蓝灯”标志着现代阿拉伯散文重要的发展阶段。
    此外还有一些小说也受读者欢迎，如叙利亚作家玛瓦希普、阿尔卡稚里的“围巾”；黎巴嫩作家阿不拉鑫·达克鲁斯的“夜”。
    过去几年来民族独立运动的发展，在阿拉伯作家的作品中也得到了反映。如卡所写的“新街”就是一个例子。小说叙述的时间是从第一次世界大战以前到1952年埃及要求撤退英军的武装示威为止。
    在1954年在大马士革举行的第一次阿拉伯进步作家代表大会上成立了阿拉伯作家联盟。联盟的口号是“发挥自由思想，争取光明前途”，反映了阿拉伯各国文艺工作者的共同愿望。
    1955年，在埃及、叙利亚和黎巴嫩等地都成立了许多出版社并出版了许多书籍，例如安纳丁出版社出版了一部叙利亚、黎巴嫩和伊拉克文学选集。黎巴嫩在1955年也发行了下列定期刊物：“自由”、“路”、“火焰”、“世纪之声”等。
    我国作家出版社曾出版过的反映阿拉伯人民生活和斗争的作品，有“阿拉伯短篇小说集”、“埃及短篇小说集”，黎巴嫩作家乔治·汉纳的小说“教堂的祭司”等。即将出版的有伊拉克的作家穆汗默德·拉希德的报告文学“来自伊拉克监狱的深处”，诗集“阿拉伯人民的呼声”，以及“波斯短篇小说集”、“埃及短篇小说”（二集）等。
