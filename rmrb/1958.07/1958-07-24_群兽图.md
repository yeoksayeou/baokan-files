    Group of Beasts
  (Peep Show)
   Lu Ruilan
      (On the stage, a stack of cartoons is propped up with two sticks, the first page bearing the three large characters "Group of Beasts") A: Comrades (pointing to the cartoon with a stick), the title of this peep show is "Group of Beasts." B: Why is it called "Group of Beasts"? The name is really fresh. A: It's not fresh, you'll know when you watch this peep show. It's the story of a group of imperialist wolves, poisonous snakes, running dogs... blindly launching a war, so it's called "Group of Beasts." B: Good, good, then please perform it for us. A: Good, you and the comrades listen: (Gongs and drums)
    The sixth month of summer is so hot,
    Everyone is fanning themselves... B: Isn't that nonsense? You don't need to tell us it's hot! A: Imperialism is being fierce, and smoke of war rises on the Mediterranean coast, hey—
        (Gongs and drums) B: Sing on! A: (Turning over the first cartoon, revealing the second. It shows the Iraqi people killing Said.) B: What is this one? A: Look ahead, another one,
    The land of Iraq is fertile and has oil fields,
    Said colludes with the US and Britain to sell the country,
    The abundant oil is seized,
    The people's revolution breaks out in a coup,
    Overthrowing the reactionary government,
    That Said planned to escape to save his life,
    But the people beat him to death, his dog's life is over, hey... B: So this is the story of the Iraqi people overthrowing the reactionary government. I heard they have already established the Republic of Iraq! A: That's right! China has already recognized the Republic of Iraq, and they have also recognized the People's Republic of China. Look ahead (Turning over the second cartoon, revealing the third. It shows the Lebanese people beating Chamoun, who is covered in wounds) B: What's going on here? A: Look at one, and then another,
    Let's take a look at the Lebanese people again.
    President Chamoun is a running dog,
    The people also want to overthrow him,
    The rebel army beats him from all sides.
    Look at his broken head and legs, don't you
    Dare pity him, hey—(Gongs and drums) B: Nonsense, why would I pity him! He is an imperialist running dog. A: (Turning over the third cartoon, revealing the fourth. It shows a wolf, with "US" written on its body, and a small dog, with "Chamoun" written on its body, on a warship, about to land) B: What is this one? A: Look ahead, another layer,
    This running dog is called Chamoun,
    Unable to defeat the people, he asks his godfather for help,
    And brings in the American wolf soldiers.
    US imperialism sends troops to interfere in internal affairs,
    Landing at the port of Beirut,
    A paper tiger is of no use,
    How can the US imperialist ambition be tolerated, hey
    ——(Gongs and drums) B: US imperialism is truly hateful. I heard they are sending troops to suppress the Lebanese people, we can't agree to that! A: He has an excuse, he says "This is Chamoun's urgent request" "to protect overseas Chinese." B: That's utter nonsense. A: (Turning over the fourth cartoon, revealing the fifth. It shows a green snake, with "UK" written on it, and a fox, with "Hussein" written on it, sitting together on an airplane, about to land) B: What's going on here? A: This one is even newer than the previous one,
    The Jordanian fox is named Hussein.
    He sees that the Arab people's strength is great,
    He fears that his kingdom will turn to ashes,
    He invites the British emperor, Hussein's master,
    Attempting to suppress the Jordanian people,
    And another purpose is to attack Iraq,
    You need to know... B: Know what? A: (Continuing to sing) Those who play with fire will always be burned
    Hey——(Gongs and drums) B: That's natural. A: Look ahead again! (Turning over the fifth cartoon, revealing the sixth, showing people around the world holding slogans, raising their arms and shouting, protesting against US and British imperialism... etc.) B: What are these people doing? A: US and British imperialism have the hearts of beasts,
    Invading Jordan and Lebanon,
    They intended to put on airs and scare people,
    But they didn't expect to anger the people of the world,
    The call to defend peace rises,
    Demonstrations are like wind and clouds,
    Warning the US and Britain to withdraw their troops,
    Otherwise, they will be sent to the grave, hey
      ——(Gongs and drums) B: Imperialism doesn't listen to warnings, it's just digging its own grave. What do you think the outcome of this matter will be? A: Look ahead: (Turning over the sixth cartoon, revealing the seventh. It shows the heroic Arab people, with the support of the people of the world, driving the wolves, dogs, snakes, and foxes into the sea)
    The Arab people have great strength,
    The people of the whole world support them.
    Heroic combat is justice,
    Great victory is in sight,
    Driving away the US paper tiger,
    The British poisonous snake is gathering in the sea,
    Dogs and foxes also find it hard to escape,
    Hitler is their ancestor,
    If you don't believe me, think about it,
    In Korea and Egypt, the US and Britain were beaten so badly they ran like shit
      Hey——(Gongs and drums) B: Victory will definitely belong to the Arab people! A: We Chinese people, like the people of the world, all love peace. We cannot turn a blind eye to beasts acting ferociously! B: Right, right! A: (Turning over the seventh cartoon, revealing the eighth. It shows Chinese workers, farmers, and the masses all clenching their fists in anger) The Chinese and Arab people are like brothers, we must support them when they are in trouble, protest against US and British aggression, put defending peace first, and unite with the people of the world, we will not give up until they withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. Hey——!
