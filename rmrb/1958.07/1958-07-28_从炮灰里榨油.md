    Squeezing Oil from Cannon Fodder
    Poem by Yuan Shuipai
    Drawing by Ying Tao
    According to United Press International reports: American life insurance salesmen rushed to Lebanon to peddle "war insurance policies" to American invading troops. The invading army cannon fodder came to the Middle East, each person's heart thumping, fifteen buckets drawing water, seven up and eight down: on what day will they return home, good or bad luck? Wall Street bosses are shrewd calculators, not letting go of even a few dollars of military pay, insurance premiums jingling into their pockets: you sell your life, I make money, different personalities.

    据合众社消息：美国人寿保险商赶到黎巴嫩向美侵略军兜售“战争保险单”。侵略军炮灰来到中东，个个人心里卜通卜通，十五只吊桶七上八下：哪一天还家乡，是吉是凶？华尔街老板算盘精通，几块钱军饷也不放松，保险费叮噹装进了荷包：你卖命我赚钱，个性不同。
