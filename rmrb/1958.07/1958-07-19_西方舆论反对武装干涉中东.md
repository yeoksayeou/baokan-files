Western Public Opinion Opposes Armed Intervention in the Middle East

(Comprehensive report by this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency reports, the armed aggression of the United States and Britain against the Middle East has aroused severe condemnation from righteous public opinion around the world, and has been strongly opposed by broad public opinion even within Western countries. Many newspapers in Western countries, in their comments on the situation in the Middle East, have condemned the United States and Britain for rudely violating international law and undermining world peace. Although some bourgeois newspapers in the United States and Britain have expressed unease about the development of national independence movements of the Middle Eastern people, they believe that armed intervention by the United States and Britain cannot save the failure of colonialism, and are worried and lack confidence about the consequences of the aggression. This situation fully demonstrates the unprecedentedly isolated situation of the US-British aggressors.

Military Adventurism Cannot Save the Failure of Colonialism

Many US newspapers call on the government to adopt a sober policy in the Middle East

Walter Lippmann, a commentator for the "New York Herald Tribune," criticized the US military intervention in Lebanon as the result of an incorrect and unrealistic policy. He called on the United States to reach an agreement with the United Arab Republic and the Soviet Union on resolving issues related to the Middle East.

Lippmann virtually admitted that the United States is now acting as the executioner of the Arab Eastern People's Movement, and asked: "How deeply will America's power be trapped in this campaign of deterrence, and for how long?..."

Lippmann believes that this is the result of a fundamental error in the concept and structure of US policy toward the Middle East. He wrote, "The view that stabilizing the Middle East requires uniting all Middle Eastern countries into a military bloc against the Soviet Union as much as possible is wrong." He also said that it is "absurd" to think that a great power like the Soviet Union can stand idly by in a region so close to it and so important to it.

Lippmann said that we cannot get any solutions until we change the way of thinking that still determines the actions of the White House and the State Department... The only way is to propose a solution to the Middle East problem based on the principle of neutrality. Lippmann pointed out that this neutrality should be guaranteed by all major powers and the United Nations.

Lippmann suggested resolving the region's problems through negotiations, and recognized that both the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic are countries that cannot be ignored, and agreements should be reached with them.

The business newspaper "Wall Street Journal" does not believe the US government's excuse for military intervention in Lebanon. The newspaper said, bluntly, "We are fighting for the oil fields in the Middle East."

The newspaper continued: "If our only policy toward Middle Eastern oil is to hold it by force, then we lose the possibility of implementing any other policy. We have no other way out except to be on guard with weapons for a long time," and this will "only cause people to hate the United States."

The "Chicago Daily News" published an editorial saying: "The outbreaks in Iraq and Lebanon prove the incompetence of our politicians, who dare not admit the influence of the movement for Arab unity among the broad masses. Our imprudence in transporting military supplies to this thorny area is even more obvious in the Iraqi issue."

The "New York Times," in its editorial on the 17th, supported the US government's aggressive actions, saying that such actions were "correct," a "gamble that must be taken," and a "worthwhile" "calculated risk." But it also had to guiltily demand that this aggressive action be dressed up to "never look like an aggression." The newspaper helplessly admitted that no matter how "regrettable and dangerous" the development of the Middle East is, "the United States cannot go in and turn back the clock."

The "Daily Mirror" said that the development of the Middle East is "the Korean incident happening all over again. We failed in Korea, and the restrictions we suffered during the war made it impossible for us to win anyway." The newspaper said, "If we fail in the Middle East, we will lose the last chance to protect our political and economic position in the world."

French Newspapers Issued a Chorus of Alarms

Worried that the Situation in Algeria Will Be Affected

The revolution in Iraq caused a chorus of panicked wails among French bourgeois newspapers. "Combat" exclaimed that the "fate of the free world is being decided" in the Middle East, and worried that the success of the Iraqi revolution would have a great impact on the Algerian people who are engaged in the struggle for national independence.

Many bourgeois newspapers also revealed a sense of resentment toward the United States and Britain in despair. These newspapers said that the United States took advantage of the Suez Canal incident to squeeze France out of the Middle East, and later the United States and Britain tried their best to prevent France from re-entering the Middle East, so that the three countries could not carry out "full cooperation" in dealing with the Arab national liberation movement. Some newspapers even talked with mocking tones about the bankruptcy of the Baghdad Pact, which France was not allowed to join. "Le Monde" said that Britain stubbornly pinned all its hopes on the Baghdad Pact in the past, and now in its gambling, there is no longer a treaty, nor Baghdad.

British People Do Not Support Government's Aggressive Behavior

Many British Newspapers Worried About the Consequences of Interventionist Policies

Some British newspapers are worried that the US and British military interventionist policies in the Middle East will bring unimaginable consequences to Britain.

The widely circulated "Daily Mirror" called those who advocate military intervention "reckless people."

The Liberal Party's newspaper "News Chronicle" also expressed the same concern. It said that waging war in Iraq under the pretext of safeguarding the safety of the British people must be opposed at all costs. Any attempt to restore those who have now lost power by force there will be political stupidity and military aggression. The newspaper admitted that Arab nationalism cannot be destroyed by bombs, whether in Egypt or Iraq.

The British "Star" commented on the Iraqi coup, saying: "Britain established this country thirty-five years ago and has always relied on it as a pillar in the quicksand of the Middle East. This coup is a major blow to Britain. The Baghdad uprising smashed the Baghdad Pact to pieces."

The newspaper believes that the Iraqi coup shows the rise of Arab nationalism and expresses concern about Britain's oil interests.

The newspaper also warned the British government not to act rashly. It said, "It seems that Britain will have to swallow this pill of nationalism"; but, "To step in and support a regime that the Iraqi people do not want, this approach will not be supported in Britain..."

The "Daily Mirror" believes that US armed intervention cannot stop the rise of Arab nationalism.

The "Manchester Guardian" warned on the 15th, commenting on the US armed intervention in the internal affairs of the Middle Eastern people, that the US approach is "stupid, amazingly stupid."

The newspaper said that the United States has embarked on a dangerous path that may lead to world war. The US action "undermines its prestige in most of the Muslim world."

The newspaper believes that British intervention in Jordan would also have "disastrous consequences."

Canadian Newspapers Published Comments One After Another

Criticizing the United States for Threatening the Cause of Peace

Canadian newspapers published comments one after another on the 17th, criticizing the US armed aggression against Lebanon and pointing out that this is a threat to the cause of peace.

The "Toronto Daily Star" wrote in an editorial: "President Eisenhower has taken a dangerous step by landing Marines in Lebanon under the baseless pretext of protecting American citizens' lives. In fact, he is interfering in the civil war and creating a threat to the cause of world peace."

The newspaper concluded by writing: "The Suez adventure should have buried the gunboat diplomacy that the United States is now pursuing. It is very likely that this diplomacy will lead to a major war, and there is little chance of success, because the people of Arab countries are now united."

The influential "Globe and Mail" pointed out in an editorial that the struggle in Lebanon in the past two months has been an internal conflict, and the United States has no right to armed intervention.

Even a reactionary and consistently pro-American newspaper like "La Presse" said in an editorial that the US support for the Lebanese Chamoun regime, "besieged by the people from all sides," is unpopular.

Italian "Avanti!" Points Out

The United States Has Intensified International Tensions

The Italian Socialist Party's "Avanti!" wrote: "The US armed intervention in Lebanon provides a new basis for the danger and tension of the international situation... A new source of war has now appeared on the world stage. We have a responsibility to shout 'enough' to those who think they can dominate the world with threats and force."

American Bandit-Style Infringement Violates International Law

Almost All Greek Newspapers Unanimously Condemned

Almost all Greek newspapers, including some newspapers that usually reflect the views of pro-American groups, condemned the US intervention in Lebanon. "Independent News" called the US armed intervention "American bandit-style infringement on Lebanon." "News" said that the landing of US troops in Lebanon violated international law. "Daily News" wrote, "Greece hopes to let the Arabs run their own affairs. The Greek people condemn violence and sympathize with the Arab national movement."

American Intervention Excuse Not Worth Refuting

West German "Die Welt" Condemns US Aggression Against Lebanon

The US armed intervention in Lebanon has also been condemned by West German public opinion.

"Die Welt" emphasized that although UN observers believe that there is no sign of any external forces "infiltrating" Lebanon, the United States still launched an aggression, so the "reason" for the US to carry out armed intervention is unfounded.

The newspaper wrote that invoking Article 51 of the UN Charter is as worthless as invoking the Eisenhower Doctrine. Dulles is now in the same situation as Eden and Pino twenty months ago (editor's note: referring to the British and French launch of the war of aggression against Egypt), and he is clinging to the edge of war with dubious legal and moral grounds.

"Neue Rhein Zeitung" emphasized the adventurous nature of US policy. The newspaper said: This approach is unreasonable, and the West is pursuing a myopic policy that is extremely dangerous to international peace. This is a policy of rashly using armed forces. The purpose of this policy is to save the position of the desert kings, which will eventually be impossible to save.

Norwegian Ruling Party Organ Publishes Editorial

Firmly Condemning US Aggression Against Lebanon

The Norwegian ruling Labour Party's organ "Arbeiderbladet" published an editorial on the 17th, firmly condemning the landing of US troops in Lebanon. The newspaper wrote: "The United States is afraid of the collapse of the governments of pro-Western Arab countries, so it believes that it must use force, but this is not enough to constitute a reason for intervention."

The newspaper concluded by writing, "What is needed now is a complete change of Western policy. The concepts of 'strongholds' and 'spheres of influence' must be abandoned and replaced by a correct understanding of the will of national revolutionary forces to aspire to neutrality."

Swedish "Dagens Nyheter" Points Out

Armed Intervention Will Bring Greater Danger to the West

Swedish "Dagens Nyheter" pointed out on the 15th: Iraq is an important tool for Western imperialism to deal with the United Arab Republic. However, the weapons now provided by the West are turned against the Baghdad Pact. The newspaper believes that Western intervention in Iraq will cause other problems and create greater dangers.

"Svenska Dagbladet" said when talking about the impact of the Iraqi revolution: The Iraqi event will have a huge impact on Lebanon and Jordan. The newspaper said: The Baghdad Pact system is already in turmoil, and a gap has been opened in the front. The newspaper believes that the Iraqi revolution is a serious blow to Western countries.

Danish Newspapers Say

Iraqi Revolution Shattered the Western Fortress in the Middle East

Danish "Berlingske Tidende" commented that the Iraqi revolution was a disaster for the "free world" and has shattered the last fortress of Western powers in the Middle East. "Social-Demokraten" editorial said: "An important link in the Baghdad Pact chain is being broken," and the newspaper also believes: "It is very obvious that events have plunged the world into a new serious crisis with the danger of completely unimaginable new armed struggles."

### 西方舆论反对武装干涉中东

    西方舆论反对武装干涉中东
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息，美英两国对中东的武装侵略，已经引起了全世界正义舆论的严正谴责，即使在西方国家内也受到了广大舆论的强烈反对。西方国家的很多报纸在关于中东局势的评论中，纷纷谴责美英两国粗暴地破坏了国际法，破坏了世界和平。美英两国的一些资产阶级报纸虽然对中东人民民族独立运动的发展表示不安，但是认为美英的武装干涉不能挽救殖民主义的失败，并且对侵略行动的后果感到担心和缺乏信心。这种情况，充分表明了美英侵略者空前孤立的处境。
    军事冒险不能挽救殖民主义的失败
    美国不少报纸要求政府在中东采取清醒的政策
    “纽约先驱论坛报”评论员李普曼批评美国对黎巴嫩的军事干涉是不正确和不现实的政策的结果，他要求美国同阿拉伯联合共和国和苏联达成解决有关中东问题的协议。
    李普曼实际上承认美国现在是充当阿拉伯东方人民运动的刽子手，他问道：“美国的力量会在这个威慑战役中陷得多深，并且要陷到什么时候呢？……”
    李普曼认为，这是美国对中东政策概念和结构上的原则性错误的结果。他写道，“认为要稳定中东必须尽可能地把所有中东国家联合成一个反对苏联的军事集团这个观点是错误的。”他还说，以为可以使像苏联这样一个大国对一个同它如此邻近、对它如此重要的地区袖手旁观是“荒谬的”。
    李普曼说，在改变仍然决定着白宫和国务院行动的思想方法之前，我们是无法得到任何解决办法的……唯一的道路就是：提出以中立原则为基础的解决中东问题的办法。李普曼指出，这种中立应该得到一切大国和联合国的保证。
    李普曼建议通过谈判解决该地区的问题，并且承认苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国都是不可等闲视之的国家，应该同它们达成协议。
    商业界报纸“华尔街日报”不相信美国政府所说的对黎巴嫩进行军事干涉的借口，这家报纸说，直截了当的说，“我们是为中东的石油产地而作战”。
    这家报纸继续说：“如果我们对中东石油的唯一政策是用武力守住它，那么我们就丧失了执行任何其他政策的可能性。除了长期地手持武器进行戒备之外，我们就没有其他的出路了”，而这样作“只会引起人们对美国的痛恨”。
    “芝加哥每日新闻”发表社论说：“伊拉克和黎巴嫩的爆发证明我国政治家的无能，他们不敢承认争取阿拉伯统一的运动在广大群众中的影响。我们在往这一棘手地区运送军用物资这方面所表现的不明智在伊拉克问题上更加明显了。”
    “纽约时报”在17日的社论中支持美国政府的侵略行动，说什么这种行动是“正确的”，是一种“必须碰碰运气”和“值得的”“有计划的冒险”。但是它又不得不作贼心虚地要求把这种侵略行动打扮得“决不可有侵略的模样”。这家报纸无可奈何地承认，不管中东的发展是“多么令人遗憾和危险，美国不能够进去把时针倒拨回转”。
    “每日镜报”说，中东的事态发展是“朝鲜事件又从头发生了一遍。我们在朝鲜失败了，我们进行战争时所受到的限制使我们无论如何都不可能赢。”报纸说，“如果我们在中东失败，我们就将失去保护我们在世界上的政治和经济地位的最后机会了”。
    法国报纸发出一片惊呼
    担心阿尔及利亚局势将受影响
    伊拉克的革命使法国资产阶级报纸发生一片惊惶的哀鸣。“战斗报”惊呼在中东“正决定着自由世界的命运”，并且担心伊拉克革命的成功会对正在从事争取民族独立斗争的阿尔及利亚人民发生很大的影响。
    不少资产阶级报纸还流露出在绝望中对美英两国的埋怨情绪，这些报纸说，美国乘苏伊士运河事件把法国从中东排挤出去，后来美英两国又极力阻止法国重新插足中东，以致三国不能在对付阿拉伯民族解放运动这方面进行“充分合作”。有的报纸甚至带着嘲弄的口吻谈到没有让法国参加的巴格达条约的破产，“世界报”说，英国过去顽固地把一切希望寄托在巴格达条约上面，现在在它的赌博中既不再有条约，也没有巴格达了。
    英国人民不支持政府侵略行为
    英国很多报纸担心干涉政策的后果
    英国一些报纸担心美英两国在中东的军事干涉政策会给英国带来不堪设想的后果。
    销路很大的“每日镜报”把那些鼓吹军事干涉的人叫作“有勇无谋的人”。
    自由党的报纸“新闻纪事报”也表示了同样的担心。它说，以维护英国人的安全为口实而进行伊拉克战争，这是必须不惜任何代价去反对的。要在那里以武力来使现在已经丧失政权的那些人复辟的任何企图，将是政治上的蠢事，同时也是军事侵略行为。这家报纸承认，无论是在埃及还是在伊拉克，阿拉伯民族主义现在都是不能用炸弹来摧毁的。
    英国“明星晚报”就伊拉克政变发表评论说：“英国在三十五年以前建立了这个国家，并且一直把它当作中东流沙中的中流砥柱而依靠它。这次政变是对英国的重大打击。巴格达起义把巴格达条约砸得粉碎了。”
    这家报纸认为伊拉克政变表明了阿拉伯民族主义精神的高涨，并且对英国的石油利益表示忧虑。
    这家报纸还警告英国政府不要轻举妄动。它说，“看来英国将不得不吞下这一颗民族主义的药丸”；但是，“要插手进去支持伊拉克人民不要的政权，这种作法在英国将不会得到支持……。”
    “每日镜报”认为，美国的武装干涉不能够制止阿拉伯民族主义的高涨。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”15日在评论美国武装干涉中东人民内政一事时警告说，美国的做法是“愚蠢的，愚蠢到惊人的地步”。
    报纸说，美国已经走上了一条可能导向世界大战的危险道路。美国的行动“破坏了它在穆斯林世界大部分地区的威信”。
    报纸认为，英国干涉约旦也会具有“灾难性质”。
    加拿大各报纷纷发表评论
    抨击美国威胁和平事业
    加拿大各报在17日纷纷发表评论，抨击美国武装侵略黎巴嫩，并且指出这是对和平事业的威胁。
    “多伦多每日星报”在编辑部文章中写道：“艾森豪威尔总统采取了一个危险的步骤，在保护美国侨民生命这个毫无根据的借口下派了海军陆战队在黎巴嫩登陆。实际上他是干涉内战，并且给全世界和平事业造成了威胁。”
    报纸最后写道：苏伊士冒险本来是应该把美国现在所追求的这种炮舰外交手腕埋葬掉的。很可能，这种外交会导致大战，而且很少有可能获得成功，因为阿拉伯各国人民现在都已经团结起来。
    有影响的“环球邮报”在编辑部文章中指出，最近两个月来在黎巴嫩进行的斗争是内部冲突，美国无权进行武装干涉。
    甚至像“新闻报”这样反动的、一贯亲美的报纸也在编辑部文章中说，美国支持“被人民从四面八方围攻”的黎巴嫩夏蒙政权是不得人心的事情。
    意大利“前进报”指出
    美国加剧了国际紧张局势
    意大利社会党“前进报”写道：“美国对黎巴嫩的武装干涉为国际局势的危险和紧张提供了新的基础……现在世界舞台上出现了一个新的战争策源地。我们有责任向那些认为用威胁和武力就可以称霸世界的人大喝一声‘够了’。”
    美国强盗式的侵犯违反国际法
    希腊几乎所有报纸一致提出谴责
    几乎所有的希腊报纸，包括一些平常反映亲美集团观点的报纸都谴责美国干涉黎巴嫩的行为。“独立新闻报”把美国的武装干涉叫做“美国对黎巴嫩的强盗式侵犯”。“新闻报”说，美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆破坏了国际法。“每日新闻”写道，“希腊希望能够让阿拉伯人当家作主。希腊人民谴责暴力，同情阿拉伯人的民族运动。”
    美国干涉借口不值一驳
    西德“世界报”谴责美国侵略黎巴嫩
    美国对黎巴嫩的武装干涉也遭到西德舆论的谴责。
    “世界报”强调指出，尽管联合国观察员认为没有任何外界力量“渗入”黎巴嫩的迹象，美国仍然发动了侵略，因此美国进行武装干涉的“理由”是没有根据的。
    这家报纸写道，援引联合国宪章第五十一条正像援引艾森豪威尔主义一样，是不值一驳的。杜勒斯现在的处境正同二十个月以前（编者按：指英法发动侵略埃及战争时期）艾登和比诺的处境一样，他抱着令人怀疑的法律上和道义上的理由紧紧地靠近了战争的边缘。
    “新莱因报”强调指出了美国政策的冒险性。这家报纸说：这种作法毫无理由，西方正在奉行一种鼠目寸光的、对国际和平极其危险的政策。这是一种轻率地动用武装力量的政策。这种政策的目的是为了在目前挽救将来总会无法挽救的沙漠国王的地位。
    挪威执政党机关报发表编辑部文章
    坚决谴责美国侵略黎巴嫩
    挪威执政的工党机关报“工人日报”17日刊登了编辑部的一篇文章，坚决谴责美军在黎巴嫩登陆。报纸写道：“美国害怕亲西方国家的阿拉伯国家政府倒台，因此它认为必须动用武力，但是这并不足以构成进行干涉的理由。”
    报纸最后写道，“现在需要的是，彻底改变西方政策。必须放弃关于‘据点’和‘势力范围’的概念，而代之以正确的理解民族革命力量渴望中立的意志。
    瑞典“每日新闻”指出
    武装干涉将给西方带来更大危险
    瑞典“每日新闻”在15日指出：伊拉克是西方帝国主义对付阿拉伯联合共和国的重要工具。但是，现在西方提供的武装却倒过来对准巴格达条约。报纸认为西方对伊拉克如果进行干涉，会引起其他问题并造成更大的危险。
    “瑞典日报”在谈到伊拉克革命的影响时说：伊拉克事件将对黎巴嫩和约旦产生巨大的影响。报纸说：巴格达条约的体系已经处在动荡中，阵线被打开了一个缺口。报纸认为伊拉克的革命是对西方国家的一次严重打击。
    丹麦报纸说
    伊拉克革命粉碎了西方在中东的堡垒
    丹麦“贝林氏时报”评论中说：伊拉克革命是“自由世界”的灾难，已经粉碎了西方大国在中东的最后一个堡垒。“社会民主报”社论说：“巴格达条约锁链上重要的一环正在被打破”，该报还认为：“非常明显，事件已将世界投入一个有着完全不堪设想的新武装斗争的危险的新的严重危机”。
