    Should Reflect New Atmosphere in Government Offices
    Every day when I open the newspaper, I see exciting and stimulating reports of victory coming from the industrial and agricultural fronts. I am an office worker, and I also yearn to see reports on government office life in the People's Daily, from which to gain strength and inspiration. However, there are very few such reports in the newspaper. Is it that there is nothing worth writing about in government office work? No. After the rectification campaign, government office life is also full of vitality. I hope that the People's Daily can appropriately reflect this.

    应当反映机关新气象
    每天打开报纸，都能看到从工农业战线上传来的捷报，令人兴奋、激动。我是一个机关工作者，也渴望从人民日报上看到反映机关生活的通讯，从中获取力量，得到启发。然而报纸上这方面的报道寥寥无几。是不是机关工作没有什么值得写的呢？不是的。经过整风，机关生活也是生气勃勃。但愿人民日报能够适当反映。
