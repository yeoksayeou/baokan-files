Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 13th. The Han River Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub project, which can be compared to the Yellow River Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub project under construction, has been decided to officially start construction ahead of schedule after the flood season this year to meet the urgent needs of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. This technologically advanced and large-scale comprehensive water conservancy project will be completed at the fastest speed in about three years.

At present, the preliminary design outline work of the project has been completed, and the designers are stepping up the expansion of the preliminary design. They have decided to strive to complete this work before the end of August this year. Relevant construction preparation work is being accelerated.

The Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub is located near the confluence of the Han River and its tributary Dan River. It is the first phase project for fundamentally controlling and comprehensively developing the Han River, and it is also the most crucial project.

The Han River is one of the largest tributaries of the Yangtze River. It is 1,530 kilometers long, with a basin area of 174,000 square kilometers and an average annual runoff of 60 billion cubic meters. Its hydropower resources are very rich, with 3.3 million kilowatts in the main stream alone. However, due to the large rainfall in the upper reaches and its extremely uneven distribution (rainfall from July to October accounts for 65% of the annual rainfall), the flood season has extremely large inflows. On the other hand, the drainage capacity of its middle and lower reaches is very small, which is very unsuitable for the flood inflows. Therefore, the situation of frequent and serious floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Han River has been frequent and serious over the years, averaging twice every three years, and causing considerable losses in each flood. Before liberation, historical mega-floods had caused serious disasters in which more than 100,000 people were drowned or died of illness. Uneven rainfall, coupled with the scattered and weak irrigation system in the basin area, also threatens the vast hilly areas with drought, and the output of agricultural products is very low. At the same time, when there is little rain and water is scarce, there are also shallow channels and many dangerous shoals, which are extremely unfavorable for navigation and are increasingly unable to meet the needs of the increasing transportation volume in the basin area.

The Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub is a large-scale water conservancy project designed and equipped by our country with the help and guidance of Soviet experts. Its main components include a dam, a spillway, auxiliary dams on both banks, and a power station building. The height of the dam is 110 meters, equivalent to 28 stories high, making it one of the largest high dams in China. The total length of the dam and auxiliary dams is 3,062 meters. After the completion of the entire project, the total reservoir capacity will be 28.3 billion cubic meters, which can control 68% of the Han River's flood season catchment area, thereby completely eliminating the largest flood (about once in a century) disasters in the Han River's records and ensuring the safety of the lives and property of millions of people in the middle and lower reaches. At the same time, the large amount of flood storage in the Danjiangkou Reservoir also has a great effect on flood control in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, especially in Wuhan.

In terms of irrigation development, calculated according to the 80% guaranteed water diversion rate, after the completion of the reservoir, 12 million mu of farmland in the Tangbai River basin, a tributary of the Han River, belonging to Henan and Hubei provinces, can be irrigated with water diverted from the Han River. Coupled with the runoff of the Tangbai River itself, the Tangbai River area can be developed into a large-scale irrigation area of 15.2 million mu. It is estimated that this can increase grain production by 7.4 billion jin and cotton production by 2 million dan per year.

The initial planned installed capacity of the Danjiangkou Hub for power generation is more than 700,000 kilowatts, with an average annual power generation of more than 4 billion kilowatt-hours. The investment per kilowatt is cheaper than the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub.

After the completion of the Danjiangkou Hub, it can also regulate runoff, greatly reducing flood flow, while increasing dry season flow by more than three times. Therefore, as long as the waterway is slightly improved, navigation conditions in the middle and lower reaches can be greatly improved. Among them, modern motorized fleets composed of 500 to 1,000-ton tug barges can pass year-round from Xiangfan to Wuhan. Since the Danjiangkou Reservoir covers an area of 900 square kilometers, the benefits of using it to raise freshwater fish will also be very huge.

The Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub may also undertake the special task of diverting Han (River) to aid the Yellow (River) or the Huai (River). Due to the superior natural conditions, only the main canal for diverting water from Danjiangkou to irrigate the Tangbai River needs to be extended, and a number of river-crossing structures need to be added to divert these waters to the Yellow River or the Huai River. The project is not too complicated. This has a significant effect on solving the water shortage problem in North China and North Huai. At the same time, the main canal can also be used to open up the North-South Grand Canal, which is extremely beneficial for the development of North-South transportation. This special task will be arranged as a long-term vision, but according to the person in charge of the relevant parties, the so-called long-term vision is not actually that far away.

In order to ensure the successful completion of the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub, the Danjiangkou Engineering Committee and the Danjiangkou Engineering Bureau have been established simultaneously recently. The Engineering Committee is chaired by Zhang Tixue, Governor of Hubei Province, and Lin Yishan, Director of the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office, and Peng Xiaoqian, Deputy Governor of Henan Province, serve as Deputy Directors.

### 与三门峡工程比美的汉江关键工程  丹江口水利枢纽今年兴工  这个水利枢纽将来担负特殊任务：引汉水济黄河或济淮河

    与三门峡工程比美的汉江关键工程
    丹江口水利枢纽今年兴工
    这个水利枢纽将来担负特殊任务：
    引汉水济黄河或济淮河
    新华社武汉13日电　可以同施工中的黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程比美的汉江丹江口水利枢纽工程，为适应工农业大跃进的迫切需要，已决定在今年汛期以后正式提前动工兴建。这个技术先进、规模宏大的综合性水利工程，将以最快的速度在大约三年多的时间内建成。
    目前，工程的初步设计要点工作已经结束，设计人员正加紧进行扩大初步设计，他们决定争取在今年8月底以前完成这一工作。有关施工准备工作正在加紧进行。
    丹江口水利枢纽位于汉江和它的支流丹江汇口处附近，是从根本上治理和综合开发汉江的第一期工程，也是最关键的工程。
    汉江是长江的最大支流之一。它全长一千五百三十公里，流域面积为十七万四千平方公里，年平均径流总量达六百亿公方。它的水力资源十分丰富，仅干流部分即有三百三十万瓩。但是，由于上游雨量大而分布又极不均匀（7月到10月的降雨量占全年雨量的65％），形成汛期洪水来量特大，而另一方面，它的中下游河槽的排泄量又很小，与洪水来量极不适应。因此，汉江中、下游地区历年来洪水泛滥成灾的情况频繁而又严重，近几十年来平均三年两遇，每次洪灾都要遭到不少损失。在解放以前，历史上的特大洪水，曾经造成过十多万人民淹死病死的严重灾难。雨量不均再加上流域区内灌溉系统零乱而单薄，还使广大丘陵区常常遭到旱灾的威胁，农产品的产量很低。同时，在雨少、水枯的时候，还出现河道浅、滩险多的情况，对航运极为不利，愈来愈不能满足流域区内运输量逐日增加的需要。
    丹江口水利枢纽是一个在苏联专家帮助和指导下，由我国自行设计和装备的大型水利工程。它的主要组成部分，包括有拦河大坝、溢洪道、两岸副坝和电站厂房。拦河大坝高度达一百一十公尺，相当于二十八层楼高，是我国现时最大高坝之一；大坝和副坝的总长度是三千零六十二公尺。整个工程完成后，水库总容量为二百八十三亿公方，可以控制汉江洪水期集水面积的68％，从而能够彻底消灭汉江有纪录以来的最大洪水（约为百年一遇）灾害，保障中、下游数百万人民的生命财产的安全。同时，丹江口水库的大量蓄洪对长江中、下游的防洪，特别是对武汉市的防洪也有很大的作用。
    在发展灌溉方面，按引水保证率80％的标准计算，水库建成后可从汉江引水灌溉汉江支流唐白河流域的属于河南、湖北两省的一千二百万亩农田，加上唐白河本身的径流，可使唐白河区域发展为一千五百二十万亩的大型灌溉区，预计每年可因此增产粮食七十四亿斤、棉花二百万担。
    丹江口枢纽发电的装机容量初步计划为七十多万瓩，年平均发电量为四十多亿度，单位瓩的投资比三门峡水利枢纽还便宜。
    丹江口枢纽建成后，还可以调节径流，使洪水流量大大降低，而枯水流量则可提高三倍以上，因此只要对航道略加整理，就能使中、下游的航运条件大为改善，其中从襄樊到武汉可终年通行五百到一千吨拖驳所组成的现代化机动船队。由于丹江口水库面积达九百平方公里，利用来养殖淡水鱼类，收益也将是十分巨大的。
    丹江口水利枢纽还有可能担负起引汉（江）济黄（河）或济淮（河）的特殊任务。由于自然条件的优越，只需将从丹江口引水灌唐白河的总干渠延长，并增加若干过河建筑物，就可把这些水引到黄河或淮河去，工程并不太复杂。这对解决华北、淮北地区的缺水问题具有重大的作用。同时，还可利用总干渠开辟南北大运河，对发展南北交通极为有利。这一特殊任务将作为远景来安排，但据有关方面的负责人谈，所谓远景实际上也并不是多么遥远的事。
    为了保证丹江口水利枢纽的胜利建成，丹江口工程委员会和丹江口工程局，已经在最近同时成立。这个工程委员会由湖北省省长张体学担任主任委员，长江流域规划办公室主任林一山和河南省副省长彭笑千担任副主任委员。
