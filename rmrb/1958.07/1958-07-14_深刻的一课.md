A Profound Lesson
程浦

At a time when everyone is joyfully discussing the great summer harvest across the country, news of wheat production decreases has come from Wu'yi County, Hebei Province: calculated by harvested area, the county's average wheat yield per mu is only 25.81 jin, a 58% decrease compared to last year, making it the county with the lowest wheat yield in Hebei Province. Today, this newspaper published a report on the decrease in wheat production in this county. This news tells us what terrible consequences can arise in agricultural production once one deviates from the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results."

From the report, it can be seen that when people fall into the mire of serious right-leaning conservative thinking, their spirit inevitably enters a state of decline, and they become superstitious and fearful of everything. Natural disasters, objective conditions, difficulties, the forces of traditional habits...they dare not touch any of these. They are afraid of even the slightest change. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that wheat production has decreased severely. For example, the traditional saying that "wheat is a low-yield crop" was discarded by many places in the first half of this year, but some comrades in Wu'yi County still believed in it. The leadership believed that "it is better to plant less wheat than to plant more," so they did not vigorously mobilize the masses to work hard on wheat field management. Seeing that the wheat was not growing well, the county destroyed 100,000 mu of wheat fields at once. When the wheat was turning green, the county committee proposed measures to irrigate the wheat, but when some people opposed this with the reason that "wheat has never been irrigated during the greening stage," the county committee withdrew its opinion. Here, one cannot see the revolutionary will and courage of the staff, nor can one see the Party's mass viewpoint and mass line. Such leadership thinking and style are so incompatible with the era of the Great Leap Forward!

Almost all those who are content to remain downstream are "condition determinists." They "see things but not people," they cannot see the subjective initiative of people, they cannot see the infinite creativity of the masses. Conditions become the basic reason for explaining their crawling state. In their view, conditions are omnipotent, as if as long as there are good conditions, without any effort, all good things will automatically be delivered to them. If they do not have such good conditions? Then they have to admit their bad luck and obediently let fate dictate! Take visiting advanced areas, for example, the attitude of "condition determinists" is different from that of ordinary people. After visiting advanced areas, ordinary people learn from advanced experiences, become more motivated, and have greater confidence. When "condition determinists" visit advanced areas, they first pay attention to asking what good conditions the other area has, rather than learning from their revolutionary spirit and advanced experiences, and they passively compare the conditions of others with their own. When representatives from Wu'yi County visited An'guo County, Hebei Province, a nationally renowned advanced county in wheat production, they first asked how many mu of land each person averaged in An'guo County, in order to find a "basis" for their county's "more land and fewer people, and crude cultivation"! As a result of the visit, they came to the conclusion that the reason why production in advanced areas is good is only because its conditions are good; and the reason why production in their own area is not good is, of course, because their own area's conditions are bad! They are unwilling to see that many of the good conditions in advanced areas have been created through the arduous efforts of millions of people. Take An'guo County, for example, people generally recognize that An'guo County has good water conservancy conditions, but this is not a gift from "heaven," but the result of the An'guo County Committee leading the people of the county to build water conservancy on a large scale. Last winter and this spring, An'guo County drilled 405 machine wells and 25 large wells, extracting the deepest underground water sources, so that they could ensure that all wheat fields were irrigated more than seven times in the driest conditions. Water conservancy, coupled with other factors, enabled An'guo County to achieve an average wheat yield of more than 400 jin per mu this year, a two-fold increase over last year. Wu'yi County, which has abundant underground water sources, did not work as hard as An'guo County in water conservancy construction. When a high tide of water conservancy construction was launched in various places last autumn, the Wu'yi County Committee emphasized "the weather is cold, materials are lacking, and we are afraid of casualties," and did not take active action. The county did not drill a single machine well with strong drought resistance, only a few earthen and brick wells. As a result, when the wheat fields needed irrigation, there was no water. Should this be blamed on poor objective conditions, or on insufficient subjective effort? The problem is obvious. Only by creating favorable conditions for high-speed wheat production increase with the greatest effort, like An'guo County, is the correct attitude of dialectical materialists towards objective conditions. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress: "Everything is done by people, and the subjective initiative of the people is a great driving force. To ignore this great driving force is to run counter to Marxism-Leninism." Countless facts in the Great Leap Forward prove that as long as we believe in the masses and mobilize the subjective initiative of cadres and the masses, we can overcome any unfavorable objective conditions and create more and more favorable conditions, thereby continuously transforming the possibility of the leap forward into reality and continuously creating miracles.

Bad things can be turned into good things. The key lies in thoroughly criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking and breaking down all superstitions. The party organization of Wu'yi County has examined the lessons of the decline in wheat production and is determined to hold high the red flag of the General Line, catch up quickly, and strive for a good autumn harvest to make up for the losses of the summer decrease. This is a good start. I believe they will surely achieve victory!

    深刻的一课
    程浦
    在这人人欢欣鼓舞地谈论全国农业夏季大丰收的时候，从河北省的武邑县却传来了小麦减产的消息：按收获面积计算，这个县的小麦平均亩产量只有二十五点八一斤，比去年减少了58％，它成了河北省小麦产量最低的一个县。本报今天发表了关于这个县的小麦减产的报道，这一消息告诉我们，在农业生产上一旦离开了党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，就会产生怎样可怕的结果。
    从报道中可以看出，当人们陷入严重右倾保守思想的泥坑中的时候，他们的精神必然处于一种萎靡状态，对什么都迷信，对什么都畏惧，自然灾害、客观条件、困难、传统习惯势力……这一切，他们都不敢去碰一碰。他们对于一点微小的变革都害怕。在这样的情况下，小麦严重减产也就不奇怪了。比如，“小麦是低产作物”的这个传统说法，今年上半年许多地方都把它抛弃了，但是武邑县的一些同志仍然迷信它。领导上认为小麦“多种不如少种好”，也就不去大力发动群众在麦田管理上下工夫。看到麦子长得不好，全县就一下子毁掉了十万亩，当小麦返青的时候，县委提出了浇麦的措施，但当有些人以“自古小麦不浇返青水”为理由反对这样做的时候，县委又撤回了这个意见。在这里，看不见工作人员的革命意志和魄力，也看不见党的群众观点和群众路线。这样的领导思想，这样的风格，同大跃进的时代多么不相称！
    几乎所有的甘居下游的人都是“唯条件论者”。他们“见物不见人”，看不见人的主观能动性，看不见群众的无穷的创造力，条件成了解释他们的爬行状态的基本理由。在他们看来，条件是万能的，似乎只要有了好的条件，用不着费力气，一切美好的东西到时候都会自动地送到面前。如果自己没有这种好条件呢？那就只好自认晦气，服服贴贴听凭命运的摆布了！拿参观先进地区来说吧，“唯条件论者”的态度就同一般人的不一样。一般人到先进地区参观之后，学了先进经验，干劲更足了，信心更高了，“唯条件论者”到先进地区参观的时候，首先不是注意学习人家的革命干劲和先进经验，而是问人家有什么好条件，消极地去比较人家和自己的条件。武邑县的代表到全国闻名的小麦丰产先进县河北省安国县参观的时候，首先就问安国县每人平均几亩地，好给他们县的“地多人少，耕作粗放”找“根据”！参观的结果他们得到这样的结论：先进地区的生产所以好，只是因为它的条件好；而自己地区的生产所以不好，当然就是自己地区的条件坏了！他们不愿意看到，先进地区的许多好的条件都是通过千百万人的艰巨努力创造出来的。就以安国县来说，人们公认安国县的水利条件好，但是这并不是“天老爷”的恩赐，而是安国县委领导全县人民大兴水利的结果。去冬今春安国县打了四百零五眼机井、二十五眼大井，把地下最深层的水源挖了出来，所以能够在最旱的情况下，保证所有的麦田浇水七次以上。水利加上其他因素，就使安国县今年小麦平均亩产量高达四百多斤，比去年增产两倍。地下水源丰富的武邑县，在水利建设上恰恰没有像安国县那样大干苦干。在去年秋后各地掀起水利建设高潮的时候，武邑县委却强调“天气冷，物料缺乏，怕发生伤亡事故”等，没有积极行动，全县没有打一眼抗旱能力大的机井，只打了少数土井和砖井。结果，麦田需要灌溉的时候没有水了，这到底应该怪客观条件不好呢，还是应该怪主观努力不够呢？问题很明显，只有像安国县那样用最大努力去创造小麦高速度增产的有利条件才是辩证唯物主义者对待客观条件的正确态度。刘少奇同志在“八大”二次会议的报告中说：“事在人为，人民群众的主观能动性是一个伟大的动力。忽视这个伟大的动力，就会同马克思列宁主义背道而驰。”大跃进中的无数事实证明，只要我们相信群众，把干部和群众的主观能动性调动起来，我们就能够战胜任何不利的客观条件，而创造出越来越多的有利条件，从而不断地把跃进的可能性变为现实性，不断地创造奇迹。
    坏事是可以变成好事的。关键就在于彻底地批判右倾保守思想，破除一切迷信。武邑县的党组织检查了小麦减产的教训，决心高举起总路线的红旗，急起直追，以争取秋季丰收来弥补夏季减产的损失。这是一个好的开始。相信他们一定能获得胜利！
