Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 15th: The first session of the Second People's Congress of Jilin Province was held from the 3rd to the 12th of July.

The 326 representatives attending the meeting listened to the government work report delivered by Li Youwen, Governor of Jilin Province, on behalf of the Provincial People's Committee, and other reports. In his report, Li Youwen pointed out that due to the rapid development of socialist construction in Jilin Province over the past five years, the economic landscape has undergone significant changes. In 1957, the province's total industrial output value increased by 115.7% compared to 1952, with an average annual actual increase of 16.6%. The proportion of the province's total industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value has increased from 43.9% in 1952 to 63.4% in 1957. Over the past five years, many large-scale modern new industries have been newly built and expanded, such as major industrial sectors like automobile manufacturing, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, electricity, coal, and petroleum. In terms of agricultural production, although the province suffered severe natural disasters in three of the five years, grain production still increased slightly compared to the average of the years during the recovery period due to the active adoption of various measures. In addition, significant achievements have been made in forestry, transportation, commerce, culture, education, health, and other fields.

The report called on the people of the province to strive for greater development in industrial and agricultural production and other construction undertakings during the Second Five-Year Plan, in accordance with the requirements of the General Line. Efforts should be made to achieve a leap in grain production within a few years and to realize water conservancy, agricultural mechanization, rural electrification, complete afforestation, and basically eliminate the "Four Pests" to change the face of the province. By 1962, the total output value of local industries will have increased significantly compared to 1957, greatly exceeding the total output value of agricultural and sideline production. After the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan, the total industrial output value will account for a large proportion of the total industrial and agricultural output value, and industrialization will be basically realized throughout the province.

The report stated that in order to achieve this bright prospect, it is first necessary to strive to complete and overfulfill the various construction tasks for this year, and special attention should be paid to seizing the production of grain, steel, and machinery. The report detailed several fundamental measures taken to increase grain production, which are: building water conservancy projects, increasing the application of manure, improving soil, promoting improved varieties, and implementing close planting. During the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward last winter and this spring, these measures have achieved remarkable results. Taking the construction of water conservancy projects as an example, the province has newly built and renovated more than 158,000 farmland irrigation projects, which can irrigate a total of 660,000 hectares of farmland, an increase of five times compared to the original plan for this year. Projects for waterlogging control and soil and water conservation have also exceeded the original plan by one or two times. The completion of these water conservancy projects has laid the foundation for water conservancy throughout the province. The report also put forward specific measures for the development of industries such as steel and machinery.

In his report, Li Youwen also emphasized the role of the Party's leadership and political and ideological work in construction. He pointed out that it is necessary to continue to consolidate the achievements of the rectification campaign, pay special attention to studying Chairman Mao's works, go deep into the masses, break superstitions, emancipate the mind, and make everyone a person with a firm mass viewpoint, simple style, broad vision, and full of energy.

After a heated discussion of Li Youwen's government work report and other reports, the representatives unanimously expressed satisfaction with the government's work and made corresponding resolutions on these reports.

At the end of the meeting, Li Youwen was elected as Governor of Jilin Province, and Yu Ke, Xu Yuanquan, Xu Shouxuan, Zhu Dehai, Liu Cikai, Yang Zhantao, Wang Huanru, and Zhou Guang were elected as Deputy Governors of Jilin Province by secret ballot. Wang Daheng and thirty others were elected as members of the Jilin Provincial People's Committee. The meeting elected Wang Jiren as President of the Jilin Provincial Higher People's Court. The 23 representatives to the Second National People's Congress elected at the meeting were: Yu Dequan, Wang Yuxian, Renqin Zhamusu, Guan Shanfu, Liu Yaxiong, Cheng Shengsan, Zhu Dehai, Li Chuanjiang, Li Diping, Song Jiehan, Zong Xiyun, Jin Shilong, Jin Xinshu, Ji Yinglin, Li Youwen, Xu Shouxuan, Tang Aoqing, Min Ganghou, Zhang Wenhai, Zhang Dexin, Feng Zhongyun, Zeng Zesheng, and Yu Deyuan.

    抓粮食  抓钢铁  抓机械
    吉林省人代会讨论生产建设事业
    新华社长春15日电  吉林省在3日到12日举行了第二届人民代表大会第一次会议。
    出席会议的三百二十六名代表听取了吉林省省长栗又文代表省人民委员会所作的政府工作报告和其他报告。栗又文在报告中指出，吉林省由于五年来社会主义建设的迅速发展，经济面貌已经发生显著变化。1957年全省工业总产值比1952年增长115.7％，每年平均实际增长16.6％。全省工业总产值在工农业总产值中的比重已由1952年的43.9％提高到1957年的63.4％。五年来已经新建和扩建了许多大规模的现代化的新型工业，如汽车制造、化学、有色金属、电力、煤炭、石油等主要工业部门。农业生产方面，虽然在五年中有三个年头遭受严重的自然灾害，但由于积极采取各种措施，粮食产量仍比恢复时期的各年平均数略有增长。此外，在林业、交通运输、商业、文化教育、卫生等方面也都取得了显著成绩。
    报告中号召全省人民根据总路线的要求，在第二个五年计划期间争取工农业生产和其他各项建设事业有更大的发展。力争在几年内粮食产量有飞跃的增长，并且实现水利化、农业机械化、农村电气化，完成造林，还要基本上消灭“四害”，改变全省的面貌。地方工业总产值到1962年将比1957年有巨大增长，大大超过农副业生产总值，在第二个五年计划完成后，工农业总产值中工业生产总值将占很大的比重，在全省范围内基本上实现工业化。
    报告中说，为了实现这一美好前景，必须首先力争完成和超额完成今年各项建设任务，特别要注意抓住粮食、钢铁和机械的生产。报告中详细叙述了增产粮食方面所采取的几项根本措施，这些措施是：兴修水利、增施粪肥、改良土壤、推广良种和实行密植等。在去冬今春大跃进高潮中，这些措施都取得了显著的成果，以兴修水利为例，全省新建和整修农田灌溉工程达十五万八千多处，共可灌溉农田六十六万公顷，比原订今年计划增加五倍；治涝和水土保持等工程也都超过原计划一、二倍以上。这些水利工程的建成，已为全省水利化打下了基础。报告中也就发展钢铁和机械等工业提出了具体措施。
    栗又文在报告中还强调建设中党的领导和政治思想工作的作用。他指出要继续巩固整风成果，特别注意学习毛主席的著作，深入群众，破除迷信，解放思想，使大家都成为有坚强群众观点、作风朴素、目光远大、干劲十足的人。
    代表们在热烈讨论了栗又文的政府工作报告和其他报告后，对政府工作一致表示满意，并且就这些报告作出了相应的决议。
    会议最后以无记名投票方式选举栗又文为吉林省省长、于克、徐元泉、徐寿轩、朱德海、刘慈恺、杨战韬、王奂如、周光为吉林省副省长，王大珩等三十人为吉林省人民委员会委员。会议选举王吉仁为吉林省高级人民法院院长。会议选出的二十三名第二届全国人民代表大会代表是：于德泉、王玉贤、仁钦札木苏、关山复、刘亚雄、成盛三、朱德海、李川江、李砥平、宋洁涵、宗希云、金时龙、金信淑、纪英林、栗又文、徐寿轩、唐敖庆、闵刚侯、张文海、张德馨、冯仲云、曾泽生、喻德渊。
