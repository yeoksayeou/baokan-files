Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 6th. The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published a commentary on the 5th, refuting Tito's speech in Labin and Popovic's recent speech to the Yugoslav Federal National Assembly.

The commentary stated: The characteristic of these speeches is, on the one hand, the abuse and vile slander of the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries of the socialist camp, and on the other hand, the praise of US imperialism, the defense of the aggressive policies of US imperialism, and the blatant interference in the internal affairs of peace-loving countries. All this proves that the Yugoslav revisionists have not only increasingly become mad enemies of Marxism-Leninism and socialism, but also mortal enemies and destroyers of the cause of peace, proving that they are increasingly tied to the chariot of US imperialism, zealously serving the needs of US imperialism.

The commentary, in refuting the so-called "independent policy" of the Yugoslav revisionists, pointed out that outside the socialist camp, there is no, and cannot be, a socialist country, nor can socialism be built. Those who are neutral between the struggle of capitalism and socialism cannot be socialists. Now the issue is very clear: the Yugoslav revisionists have long betrayed Marxism-Leninism, and they are traitors to socialism. They are doing their best to use the guise of "socialist independent policy" to cover up their treacherous behavior and attempt to deceive the Yugoslav people with it. Facts are increasingly proving that the Tito clique's attempt to "not participate in blocs" is just a worthless agitation. Because they have in fact joined the imperialist bloc, are implementing the policies of US imperialism, and are serving this bloc.

The commentary then refuted the fallacy of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries interfering in Yugoslav internal affairs and opposing neutrality. The commentary pointed out that this is precisely to cover up the new preparations of the imperialists against the freedom of all countries. Here we see the reappearance of the old strategy of the imperialists. Imperialists are good at loudly shouting about Soviet interference to cover up their aggressive preparations against other countries. For example, when preparing for the invasion of Egypt, Dulles shouted "Soviet interference." A few years ago, when the imperialists burned and destroyed the peaceful cities and villages of Korea, they also shouted "Chinese interference" in Korea. Today, when the United States is blatantly interfering in Lebanon and Indonesia, when British planes are threatening the peaceful residents of Yemen and are trying to conquer Oman, when French colonialists are plunging Algeria into a bloodbath, when the imperialists are plotting quietly, and Tito is acting as an imperialist megaphone next to them, they are again shouting about the so called "interference of the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia."

The commentary pointed out that the Yugoslav revisionist leadership group headed by Tito shamelessly distorts the attitude of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries towards neutral countries. The Soviet Union and socialist countries never impose their ideas and systems on others; on the contrary, they highly value the efforts made by neutral countries to defend world peace, and they maintain good relations with neutral countries. The people of countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and the United Arab Republic are all seeing the fact that friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries is the most reliable guarantee for developing their national economy and national culture and protecting their independence from colonialist enslavement. The so-called "neutral policy" implemented by the Yugoslav revisionist leadership group has nothing in common with the peace policy of neutral countries against imperialism; it is merely to cover up its essence of opposing socialism and the cause of world peace and serving US imperialism.

The commentary pointed out that Tito, disguised in sheep's clothing, insisted in his speech in Labin that the Yugoslav revisionist leadership was an innocent victim of the erroneous attacks of the communist and workers' parties of various countries, and that the communist and workers' parties of various countries had misinterpreted the views of the Yugoslav leadership. How else could they answer the principled criticisms based on facts by the communist and workers' parties of various countries if they did not say so? This is also a means they use to protect their masks of "communism" and "socialist builders." Without this mask of "socialist," the Yugoslav revisionist chieftains would have no special value to imperialism. For imperialism, the value of Yugoslav revisionism lies precisely in its "socialist mask," because they use this mask as a Trojan horse to split the communist movement, the socialist camp, and the world peace forces. However, the mask of Yugoslav revisionism has been torn off, and it should be exposed to the end, which is beneficial to the cause of socialism and peace and to the Yugoslav people. In order to deceive their own people and hide their true role as running dogs of imperialism in front of the people, the Yugoslav revisionists are doing their best to touch the national feelings of the people, promote nationalism, and try to antagonize the Yugoslav people with the people of socialist countries, as shown in Tito's speech. Tito falsely accused that the criticism of the revisionism of the leadership group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia was an anti-Yugoslav movement. However, the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries have never confused revisionism with the fraternal Yugoslav people at any time. Tito and other chieftains are revisionists, and their policy is to serve imperialism and harm the vital interests of the Yugoslav people, because Tito has long placed the interests of the Yugoslav people under the feet of imperialism. Only traitors shamelessly pretend to speak for the people, while in fact deceiving the people. The commentary then pointed out that, in order to carry out the instructions of their masters, Tito launched a series of vile attacks against the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries in the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and in the speech in Labin. The brunt of the attack by Tito and his gang was first directed at the Soviet Union, China, and the Communist Party of China, because this is one of the main instructions given to them by US imperialism to carry out a frenzied opposition to China, first because China is a powerful socialist country, and the great achievements China has made in developing its economy and culture are a good example and attractive to other Asian countries that have shaken off the colonialist system or are being liberated from colonialist oppression; secondly, China is a powerful factor for world peace, especially peace in the Far East, and a major obstacle to US imperialism's implementation of its aggressive plans in this region; and thirdly, because all attempts by US imperialism to enslave the great Chinese people by supporting Chiang Kai-shek have met with shameful failure.

The commentary emphasized that the Yugoslav revisionist leaders cursed the glorious Communist Party of China because it had waged a resolute and in-depth Marxist-Leninist struggle to expose Yugoslav revisionism. Tito and other traitors could not answer the principled criticisms based on facts from the Chinese comrades, so they openly slandered and insulted the Communist Party of China, even accusing China of being an "aggressor and warmonger"! However, these vile slanders can only arouse hatred. A few days ago, the "People's Daily" correctly pointed out that Tito's slander against China was "a dwarf kneeling in the mud desperately spitting at a giant standing on a high mountain, and however he spits, it can only fall on his own face." The Communist Party of China is a glorious party, completely loyal to Marxism-Leninism and the cause of socialism, and it enjoys the love and respect of all communists and loyal people in the world. The commentary went on to say that the Yugoslav revisionist leaders, in their speeches and in their publications, did not let go of their attacks on the Albanian Party of Labor. Tito said in his speech, "In the movement against Yugoslavia, the Albanian leaders are standing in the forefront, if not to say that they are the initiators." The Albanian Party of Labor has never launched a movement against Yugoslavia; this is just an absurd slander by Tito. However, the Albanian Party of Labor is proud that they can stand at the forefront of the struggle against the enemies of socialism, against the opportunists, and against the traitors to Marxism-Leninism. Tito's abuse of us in Pula and recently in Labin makes us feel honored, because from such chauvinists and anti-Marxists, one can only receive abuse. However, the traitors in Belgrade should know that they have a long history of failed attacks on Albania, and the Albanian Republic and the Party of Labor have always stood like diamonds in the past and now, and whoever touches it will be injured. The commentary concluded by saying that Tito's speech in Labin received great praise from US imperialism and all Western reactionary publications. For example, the US State Department said that Tito's ideals are in line with the ideals of US imperialism. This point made by the US State Department is completely correct and does not require any additions or comments. It is precisely because of this that US imperialism has given a large amount of aid to the Yugoslav revisionists, and Tito praised this aid in his speech. But for those who are fighting for socialism and peace, Tito's speech in Labin only shows that the Yugoslav leadership group has fallen deeply into the pit of treachery, indicating that Tito is a mortal enemy of the socialist camp and the international communist movement, a faithful lackey of US imperialism, and an enemy of peace.

    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”发表评论
    痛斥铁托在拉宾的反动演说
    指责南斯拉夫修正主义者热心为美帝国主义的需要效劳
    新华社地拉那6日电  阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”5日发表评论，驳斥了铁托在拉宾发表的演说和波波维奇最近在南斯拉夫联邦国民议会上的讲话。
    评论说：这些讲话的特点一方面是对苏联、中国和社会主义阵营其他国家的和平外交政策的谩骂和下流诬蔑，另一方面是对美帝的赞扬和为美帝国主义的侵略政策辩护，并且粗暴地干涉爱好和平的各国人民的内政。这一切都证明南斯拉夫修正主义者不仅日益变成了马克思列宁主义和社会主义的疯狂敌人，而且变成了和平事业的死敌和破坏者，证明他们日益系在美帝的战车上，热心地为美帝国主义的需要效劳。
    评论在驳斥南斯拉夫修正主义者所谓的“独立政策”时指出，在社会主义阵营以外没有、并且也不可能有社会主义国家，也不可能建设社会主义。中立于资本主义和社会主义斗争之间的也不可能是社会主义者。现在问题很清楚，南斯拉夫修正主义者早已叛变了马克思列宁主义，他们是社会主义的叛徒。他们极力用“社会主义独立政策”的幌子掩盖他们的叛徒行为，并且企图以此来欺骗南斯拉夫人民。事实日益更加清楚地证明，铁托一伙修正主义者“不参加集团”的企图只是一种不值钱的煽动。因为他们事实上参加了帝国主义集团，执行着美帝国主义的政策，并效劳于这一集团。
    评论接着驳斥了所谓苏联和人民民主国家干涉南斯拉夫内政和反对中立的谬论。评论指出，这正是为掩护帝国主义者反对各国人民的自由的新的准备工作。这里我们看到了帝国主义者的老策略的再一次出现。帝国主义者善于高声叫喊苏联的干涉来掩盖他们反对其他国家的侵略准备工作。例如，在准备对埃及的侵略时，杜勒斯曾叫喊“苏联干涉”。几年前，当帝国主义者焚烧破坏朝鲜的和平城市和乡村时，他们也叫喊“中国干涉”朝鲜。今天，当美国正在粗暴地干涉黎巴嫩和印度尼西亚，当英国飞机正在威胁着也门的和平居民并且竭力征服阿曼时，当法国殖民主义者正将阿尔及利亚沉于血泊中时，当帝国主义者正在小声策划、而铁托在旁边起作帝国主义扩音机的作用的时候，他们又在叫喊所谓“苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家干涉南斯拉夫的内政”。
    评论指出，以铁托为首的南斯拉夫修正主义领导集团无耻地歪曲苏联和其他社会主义国家对中立国家的态度。苏联和社会主义国家从不把他们的思想和制度强加于别人头上，相反的，他们高度地评价中立国家为保卫世界和平所作的努力，他们和中立国家保持着良好的关系。像印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、阿拉伯联合共和国等国家的人民都正在看到这样的事实：和苏联、中国以及其他人民民主国家的友谊和合作是发展它们的国民经济和民族文化和保卫它们的独立，使其免受殖民主义奴役的最可靠的保障。南斯拉夫修正主义领导集团执行的所谓“中立政策”和中立国家反对帝国主义的和平政策没有任何相同之处，它只不过是为了掩盖其反对社会主义和世界和平事业以及为美帝国主义效劳的实质。
    评论指出，披上了羊皮的铁托，在拉宾的讲话中硬说南斯拉夫的修正主义领导是各国共产党和工人党的错误进攻的无辜的牺牲品，硬说各国共产党和工人党错误地解释了南斯拉夫领导的观点。他们不这么说又怎能回答各国共产党和工人党有事实根据的原则批评呢？这也是他们用来保护他们的“共产主义”和“社会主义建设者”面具的手段，没有这种“社会主义者”的面具，南斯拉夫修正主义首脑们对于帝国主义来说就没有什么特别的价值了。对帝国主义来说，南斯拉夫修正主义的价值恰恰就是它的“社会主义面具”，因为他们把这种面具当作特洛伊木马，用来分裂共产主义运动、社会主义阵营和世界和平力量。但是，南斯拉夫修正主义的面具已被撕开了，应该把它们揭露到底，这是有利于社会主义和和平事业以及南斯拉夫人民的。为了欺骗本国人民和在人民面前掩盖他们作为帝国主义走狗的真正作用，南斯拉夫修正主义者极力触动人民的民族情感，推行民族主义，极力使南斯拉夫人民和社会主义各国人民对立起来，在铁托的演说中也表明了这一点。铁托诬蔑说，对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团修正主义的批判是一个反南斯拉夫的运动。可是社会主义国家的共产党和工人党在任何时候也没有把修正主义和兄弟的南斯拉夫人民混淆起来。铁托和其他首脑是修正主义者，他们的政策是效劳于帝国主义，损害着南斯拉夫人民的切身利益的，因为铁托早已把南斯拉夫人民的利益置于帝国主义脚底下了。只有叛徒才无耻地假装为人民说话，而其实是在欺骗人民。评论接着指出，为了执行他们主子的嘱咐，在南共第七次代表大会上和拉宾的演说中，铁托发动了反社会主义国家各国共产党和工人党的一系列下流的进攻。铁托及其一伙攻击的锋芒首先指向苏联、中国和中国共产党，因为这是他们执行疯狂反对中国的美帝国主义的主要嘱咐之一，首先因为中国是一个强大的社会主义国家，中国在发展经济和文化方面所取得的巨大成就对摆脱了殖民主义制度或正在从殖民主义压迫下解放出来的其他亚洲国家是很好的范例和具有吸引力；其次，中国是世界和平、特别是远东和平的强大因素，是美帝国主义在这一区域实行侵略计划的主要障碍；再就是因为美帝国主义为奴役伟大的中国人民而支持蒋介石的一切企图都遭到了可耻的失败。
    评论强调指出，南斯拉夫修正主义头子们咒骂光荣的中国共产党，还因为它为揭露南斯拉夫修正主义进行了坚决的深入的马克思列宁主义斗争。铁托和其他叛徒不能回答中国同志们的有事实根据的原则批评，因而他们公开诬蔑和侮辱中国共产党，直到指责中国是“侵略者和战争挑拨者”！但是，这些下流的诬蔑只能引起人们的憎恨。几天以前“人民日报”正确地指出铁托对中国的诬蔑是“跪倒在泥塘里的侏儒拚命向立在高山上的巨人吐唾沫，怎样吐也只能落到自己的脸上”。中国共产党是一个光荣的、完全忠实于马克思列宁主义和社会主义事业的政党，它享有世界所有共产党人和忠实的人民的热爱和尊敬。评论接着说，南斯拉夫修正主义领导者在讲话中在刊物上也没有放过对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的进攻。铁托在其演说中说“在反对南斯拉夫的运动中，阿尔巴尼亚的领导人是站在先行者之列，如果不说他们是发起人的话”。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党人任何时候都没有掀起过反对南斯拉夫的运动，这只是铁托的一种荒谬的诬蔑。可是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党人以他们能够站在反对社会主义敌人、反对机会主义者和马克思列宁主义叛徒的斗争的前列而骄傲。铁托在普拉以及最近在拉宾对我们的谩骂使我们感到光荣，因为从这样的沙文主义者和反马克思主义者那里只能受到谩骂。但是，贝尔格莱德的叛徒们应该晓得，他们有长期攻击阿尔巴尼亚的失败教训，阿尔巴尼亚共和国和劳动党过去和现在都永远像金刚石般的屹立着，谁碰它，谁就要头破血流。评论最后说，铁托在拉宾的讲话获得了美帝国主义和所有西方反动刊物的极大赞扬。例如，美国国务院称铁托的理想是和美帝国主义的理想相符合的。美国国务院所讲的这一点是完全正确的，不需要任何附加和任何评论。正因为如此，美帝给南斯拉夫修正主义者以大量的援助，对这种援助铁托在其演说中是备加赞扬。但对于正在为社会主义和和平而斗争的人来说，铁托在拉宾的演说只是说明南斯拉夫领导集团已深深陷于叛徒的泥坑，表明铁托是社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的死敌，是美帝国主义的忠实走狗，是和平的敌人。
