Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 9th: Kawa ethnic farmers in Yunnan Province, who have shed their primitive lifestyles, and liberated Yi ethnic slaves in the Lesser Liang Mountains, have planted rice for the first time in the 110,000 mu of newly reclaimed paddy fields this year.

	This spring, the Kawa Mountains, like the inland areas of Yunnan Province, experienced a prolonged drought. Kawa ethnic farmers, who had never had the habit of fighting drought, planted more than 50,000 mu of rice in accordance with the seasons while fighting the drought. In the process of resisting drought and planting, the Kawa ethnic farmers in Cangyuan County, for the first time, implemented large-scale cooperation between villages and between townships, communes, mutual aid teams, and individual households, solving the difficulties of insufficient labor, draught cattle, and rice seedlings, and accelerating the progress of transplanting. At present, the farmers in the Kawa Mountains have shifted to mid-season management and summer hoeing.

	The liberated Yi ethnic farmers in Ninglang County in the Lesser Liang Mountains have planted more than 60,000 mu of rice, most of which is also newly opened paddy fields this year. For many years, the slaves living in the Lesser Liang Mountains have lived on miscellaneous grains such as potatoes and oats. Most Yi people not only have never grown rice, but have also rarely eaten rice. Since the great leap forward in agriculture last winter and this spring, local farmers have opened paddy fields for the first time on high mountains with an elevation of 2,500 meters to 2,800 meters, and planted more than 60,000 mu of seedlings. During planting, with the help of outside cadres and Han farmers, they quickly learned the techniques of pulling seedlings, tying seedlings, and transplanting seedlings. At present, the rice fields in the Lesser Liang Mountains are lush and green, and everyone is beaming with joy.

    佧佤山和小凉山大种水稻
    据新华社昆明9日电  摆脱了原始生活状态的云南省佧佤族农民，和解放了的小凉山彝族奴隶们，已经在今年新开垦的十一万亩水田里第一次栽下了稻谷。
    今年春天，佧佤山也和云南省内地一样，久旱不雨。从来没有抗旱习惯的佧佤族农民，在同干旱作斗争中，按节令栽下了五万多亩水稻。在抗旱栽插中，沧源县的佧佤族农民破天荒地实行了村寨之间以及乡、社、互助组、单干户之间的大协作，解决了劳动力、耕牛、秧苗不足的困难，加快了栽秧进度。目前，佧佤山农民已经转入中耕夏锄。
    解放了的宁蒗县小凉山彝族农民，已栽上六万多亩稻谷，其中大部分也是今年新开的水田。许多年来，居住在小凉山上的奴隶们，都是靠洋芋、燕麦等杂粮为生，大多数彝族人民不但没有种过水稻，连大米也很少吃过。去冬今春农业大跃进以来，当地农民第一次在拔海二千五百公尺到二千八百公尺的高山上开了水田，栽下了六万多亩秧。在栽种中，他们在外来干部和汉族农民的帮助下，很快地学会了拔秧、捆秧、栽秧的技术。目前小凉山上稻田一片油绿，人们个个喜笑颜开。
