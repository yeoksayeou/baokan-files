    Refinery Built in Three Days
    (By Our Correspondent) A small refinery was recently built in Taizi Township, Shanshan County, Xinjiang, after three days and nights of hard work.
    This factory was built through simple and crude methods, using local materials. In addition to a set of small refining boilers donated by the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration, it only invested 53 yuan to purchase parts to build the factory.
    The factory can now produce 200 jin of oil per day. (Zhang Weihe)

    三天建成一座炼油厂
    本报讯　新疆鄯善县台子乡最近苦战三昼夜建成一座小型炼油厂。
    这个厂因陋就简，就地取材，除新疆石油管理局赠送给一套小型炼油锅炉外，只投资购买了五十三元的零件，就把厂子建成了。
    现在这个厂每天可以产油二百斤。　（张维和）
