Xinhua News Agency, 30th -- Preliminary statistics show that the total output of summer grain crops across the country this year has surged by more than 35 billion jin compared to last year, reaching approximately 95 billion jin. Among them, winter wheat increased by more than 22 billion jin, reaching about 64 billion jin. China's total wheat production has surpassed that of the United States, ranking second in the world and becoming the second-largest wheat-producing country after the Soviet Union.

This figure, marking an unprecedented bumper harvest of summer grain crops nationwide, is based on the latest aggregated preliminary statistics from various provinces and regions by the Ministry of Agriculture. Harvesting and threshing work in some areas have not yet been fully completed.

This year's summer harvest crops, covering over 535.7 million mu, are mainly winter wheat, but also include spring-sown peas, broad beans, and spring-sown barley and wheat in inland regions.

This year's winter wheat harvest is unprecedented. In the summer of 1957, the area sown with winter wheat was more than 364 million mu, which is more than 9 million mu more than the area sown with winter wheat this summer. The increase in production this year is mainly due to increased yields per unit area. Last year, the average yield of winter wheat in the country was only 112.8 jin per mu, but this year it has leaped to about 180 jin. According to incomplete statistics from the five provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Shandong alone, there are more than 200,000 mu with high yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu, and high-yield records of more than 4,000 jin and 5,000 jin have appeared. Broad beans and spring-sown barley also have high-yield records of more than 1,000 jin.

This year's summer harvest is the first high-speed leap-forward increase in agricultural production during the Great Leap Forward, which powerfully shattered the superstition that agricultural development cannot be fast. This year's bumper summer harvest is not due to favorable weather, but the result of the hard work and efforts of the broad masses of farmers under the leadership of the Party. A farming proverb says: "Three rains are needed for the wheat harvest in the eighth, tenth, and third months," meaning that a thorough rain is needed in the eighth month of the lunar calendar before sowing wheat in the autumn, a thorough rain is needed in the tenth month after sowing, and a thorough rain is needed in the third month of spring when the wheat is heading, so that wheat can have a bumper harvest. Last year, wheat was sown in the main wheat-producing areas under drought conditions, and there was no rain after sowing. This spring, North China was very dry. In Henan, there were no rains in the eighth and tenth months of the lunar calendar, and in Hebei, there were no rains in the eighth, tenth, and third months. In addition, wheat in various places suffered from frost, wind, hail, and diseases and insect pests. However, this year's summer harvest still achieved a bumper harvest. This is the result of large-scale water conservancy construction, large-scale fertilizer accumulation, increased fertilizer application and irrigation in wheat fields, meticulous management, and a tenacious struggle against disasters. This powerfully shows that under the leadership of the Party, the people have the power to overcome unfavorable climatic conditions and achieve a bumper harvest.

    我国农业生产大跃进的第一曲凯歌
    夏粮增产350亿斤
    小麦总产量超过美国跃居世界第二
    新华社30日讯　今年全国夏收粮食作物总产量初步统计比去年猛增三百五十多亿斤，达到九百五十亿斤上下。其中冬小麦增产二百二十多亿斤达到六百四十亿斤左右。我国小麦总产量已经超过美国跃居世界第二位，成了仅次于苏联的产麦最多的国家。
    这个标志着全国夏收粮食作物获得空前大丰收的数字，是农业部最近根据各省、区的初步统计数字合计的。有些地方麦收的打场工作还没有完全结束。
    今年全国五亿三千五百七十多万亩夏收作物主要是冬小麦，此外还包括春种豌豆、蚕豆和关内各地的春种大、小麦等。
    今年冬小麦空前丰收。1957年夏收的冬小麦面积为三万六千四百多万亩，比今年夏收冬小麦面积多九百多万亩。今年增产主要是单位面积的产量提高了。去年全国冬小麦的平均亩产才一百一十二点八斤，今年跃进到一百八十斤左右。每亩千斤以上的高产量仅据河南、安徽、江苏、陕西、山东五省不完全统计就有二十多万亩，并且出现了四千斤、五千斤以上的高产纪录。蚕豆和春种大麦等都有千斤以上的高产纪录。
    今年夏收是大跃进中，农业生产上首次取得的高速度的跃进增产，有力地打破了农业发展快不了的迷信。今年夏收丰收也不是由于风调雨顺，而是广大农民在党的领导下，鼓足干劲、力争上游争取得来的。农谚说：“麦收八、十、三场雨”，即秋季种麦前阴历八月需一场透雨，种后阴历十月需一场透雨，春季三月抽穗时需一场透雨，这样小麦才能丰收。去年种麦主要产麦区都是抗旱播种的，种后也没有雨。今春华北很旱，以河南说没有八、十两场雨，以河北说八、十、三三场雨都没有。此外，各地小麦还分别遭受过霜冻、风、雹和病虫等灾害。但是今年夏收仍然取得了大丰收。这就是大修水利、大量积肥以后，麦地大量增施了肥料和增加了灌溉，并且精细管理，和灾害进行顽强斗争的结果。这有力地说明，在党的领导下，人民有力量克服不利的气候条件取得丰收。
