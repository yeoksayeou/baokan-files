Xinhua News Agency, 19th – New York dispatch: Soviet Representative Sobolev, near the conclusion of the Security Council's emergency meeting on the 18th, proposed a new resolution calling for an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the "intervention of the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan."

The Soviet Union's new proposal states:

"The Security Council,

Considering the situation created in the Near and Middle East by the entry of United States and British armed forces into Lebanon and Jordan respectively,

Noting that this action by the United States and Britain is a threat to international peace and security,

Pointing out that the Security Council's 834th meeting has not been able to fulfill its primary responsibility for maintaining peace and security,

Hereby decides to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the intervention of the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan."

This new Soviet proposal was put forward after the Security Council voted separately on the previous Soviet proposal demanding the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, the US proposal demanding the dispatch of UN forces to Lebanon, and the Swedish proposal suggesting the cessation of the UN Observer Group in Lebanon's activities. During the voting, the Soviet proposal demanding the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan was rejected with one vote in favor (Soviet Union), two abstentions (Sweden and Japan), and eight votes against. The US proposal was rejected with nine votes in favor, one abstention (Sweden), and the Soviet Union against. The Swedish proposal was rejected with nine votes against and two votes in favor (Soviet Union and Sweden).

Soviet Representative Sobolev, speaking after the vote, said that the Soviet delegation voted against the US proposal because it endorsed the US armed forces' invasion of Lebanon. Such endorsement would be a mockery of the fundamental principles upon which the United Nations was founded. It would also be an insult to world opinion against aggression in the Near and Middle East. The Soviet delegation voted against the US proposal also because the proposal stipulated the organization of UN armed forces to go to Lebanon, and the task of this force was contrary to the UN Charter.

Sobolev continued that the Security Council did not support the Soviet proposal, which demanded that the US and British governments cease armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries and immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan. This vote stained the Security Council.

Sobolev said that faced with US and British armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries, the Security Council had taken no measures to end this act of aggression, which not only threatened peace and security in the Near and Middle East, but also threatened peace and security throughout the world. The Security Council had thus failed to fulfill its obligation under the UN Charter to maintain international peace and security. Those Security Council members who did not support the Soviet proposal bore a serious responsibility for the further aggravation of the international situation and the deepening of the danger of a new war.

Sobolev said that, in view of the outcome of the vote, the Soviet Union demanded the immediate convening of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the "intervention of the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan," and he put forward a corresponding new proposal.

Speaking of the Soviet Union's attitude towards the situation in the Near and Middle East, Sobolev said that the Soviet government had stated that the Soviet Union could not remain indifferent to the unprovoked acts of aggression in areas adjacent to its borders, and that for the sake of the security of the Soviet Union and the maintenance of world peace, it would have to take the necessary measures.

Before the Soviet representative spoke, other representatives also spoke.

Arab Union Republic representative Lutfi said that the US ambassador to Cairo met with the Foreign Minister of the Arab Union Republic on the 17th and handed him a note containing intolerable threats. The note stated that "if elements controlled by the Arab Union Republic" attacked US armed forces, it would cause "serious consequences." Lutfi emphasized the enormous danger of this US position because, as recent US actions had shown, the US had arrogated to itself the right to decide who was controlled by whom. Lutfi stressed that this US action was a threat to the Arab Union Republic and other Middle Eastern countries. This threat exposed the US's overall conspiracy in the region.

Lutfi also said that the situation in Iraq was fairly stable, but that King Hussein of Jordan's continuous threats to "liberate Iraq" were a "very dangerous" attitude.

Security Council Chairman Arago, speaking in his capacity as the representative of Colombia, indirectly condemned US policy in the Near East. He said that he felt doubtful and uneasy about the situation in the Middle East. He said that he would vote in favor of the US proposal, but that Colombia was not prepared to send troops to participate in UN armed forces as it had done during the Korean War.

US Representative Lodge, in his speech, once again attempted to conceal the US armed intervention in Lebanon. Seeing that the convening of an emergency session of the UN General Assembly was inevitable, he also expressed his support for convening an emergency session of the General Assembly and put forward a corresponding proposal.

The Security Council also discussed the credentials of the Iraqi representative on this day. Soviet Representative Sobolev, speaking on this issue, pointed out that the representative of the former Iraqi government, Abbas, was still illegally occupying Iraq's seat in the United Nations. Abbas made a dangerous argument in the name of Iraq on the 17th, insisting that the Iraq-Jordan Federation had not changed in any way. This lie was in the interest and for the purpose of the United States and Britain, who were backing Abbas, as they were plotting a new aggression against Iraq under the pretext of "restoring order." Sobolev stressed that only the representative appointed by the Republic of Iraq had the right to represent Iraq.

However, with the opposition of Western countries, the Council did not recognize the credentials of Jawad, the legitimate representative appointed by the Republic of Iraq, on this day.

Because the Japanese representative said that he would put forward a new proposal on the situation in the Middle East, the Council finally decided to hold another meeting on the 21st.

### 安理会不能制止美英侵略行为  苏联建议召开联大紧急会议  阿联代表严厉谴责美国无耻恫吓中东人民

    安理会不能制止美英侵略行为
    苏联建议召开联大紧急会议
    阿联代表严厉谴责美国无耻恫吓中东人民
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：苏联代表索波列夫在安全理会事18日紧急会议行将结束时提出了一个新提案，要求召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论“美国和英国干涉黎巴嫩和约旦”的问题。
    苏联的新提案说：
    “安全理事会，
    考虑到由于美国和英国武装部队分别开入黎巴嫩和约旦而在中近东造成的局势，
    注意到美英两国的这种行动是对国际和平和安全的威胁，
    指出，安全理事会第八百三十四次会议没有能够完成它对维护和平和安全的主要责任，
    兹特决定召开联合国大会紧急会议，来讨论美国和英国干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的问题。”
    苏联这个新提案是在安全理事会对苏联以前提出的要求美国和英国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的提案、美国提出的要求派联合国部队到黎巴嫩去的提案和瑞典提出的建议停止联合国黎巴嫩观察员的活动的提案分别进行表决后提出的。在表决时，苏联要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的提案以一票赞成（苏联）、两票弃权（瑞典和日本）以及八票反对而遭否决。美国提案以九票赞成、一票（瑞典）弃权和苏联反对而遭否决。瑞典提案以九票反对、两票赞成（苏联和瑞典）遭否决。
    苏联代表索波列夫在表决后发言说，苏联代表团所以投票反对美国提案，是因为这一提案赞同美国武装部队侵入黎巴嫩。这种赞同将是对联合国赖以成立的主要的基本原则的嘲弄。这也将是对全世界反对侵略中近东的舆论的侮辱。苏联代表团所以投票反对美国提案，还因为这个提案规定组织联合国武装部队去黎巴嫩，而这支部队的任务是违背联合国宪章的。
    索波列夫接着说，安全理事会没有支持苏联的提案，而苏联的提案是要求美国和英国政府停止武装干涉阿拉伯国家内政和立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军的。这个表决玷污了安全理事会。
    索波列夫说，面临美国和英国武装干涉阿拉伯内政，安全理事会没有采取任何措施来终止这种不仅威胁中近东的和平和安全，而且威胁全世界的和平和安全的侵略行动。安全理事会从而没有履行联合国宪章所赋予它的维护国际和平和安全的义务。而那些没有支持苏联提案的安全理事会理事国对国际局势的进一步紧张和爆发新战争的危险性的加深负有严重责任。
    索波列夫说，由于表决的结果，苏联要求立即召开联合国大会来讨论“美国和英国干涉黎巴嫩和约旦”的问题，他并且提出了相应的新提案。
    谈到苏联对中近东局势的态度，索波列夫说，苏联政府已经声明，苏联不能对在其国境邻近地区的无端侵略行动置若罔闻。并且它为了苏联的安全和维护世界和平，将不得不采取必要的措施。
    在苏联代表发言以前，其他代表也发了言。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表卢特菲说，美国驻开罗大使17日会见了阿拉伯联合共和国外交部长并把一份包含着令人难以容忍的威胁的照会交给了他。照会说，“一旦由阿拉伯联合共和国控制的分子”向美国武装部队进攻就将引起“严重的后果”。卢特菲强调指出美国这种立场的巨大危险，因为，正如美国最近的行动所表明的那样，美国自封有决定谁受谁控制的权利。卢特菲强调指出，美国这个行动是对阿拉伯联合共和国和其他中东国家的威胁。这个威胁暴露了美国在这个地区的总的阴谋。
    卢特菲还说，伊拉克的局势相当稳定，但是约旦国王连续不断地扬言要“解放伊拉克”这是一种“十分危险”的态度。
    安全理事会主席阿拉霍以哥伦比亚代表身份发言时间接地谴责了美国在近东的政策。他说，他对中东局势感到怀疑和不安，他说，他将投票赞成美国的提案，不过，哥伦比亚不准备像在朝鲜战争时期那样派遣军队参加联合国武装部队。
    美国代表洛奇在发言中再次企图掩饰美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的活动。由于看到联合国大会紧急会议的召开不可避免，他也表示赞成召开大会紧急会议，并且提出了相应的提案。
    安全理事会这一天还讨论了伊拉克代表的资格问题。苏联代表索波列夫就这个问题发言时指出，伊拉克前政府的代表阿巴斯至今还非法地窃据伊拉克共和国在联合国中的席位，阿巴斯17日以伊拉克的名义发表了一种危险的论调，他硬说伊拉克—约旦联邦没有发生任何变化。这种谎话是符合为阿巴斯撑腰的美国和英国的利益和目的的，因为它们正以“恢复秩序”为借口策划对伊拉克的新侵略。索波列夫强调指出，只有伊拉克共和国任命的代表才有权代表伊拉克。
    但是，在西方国家的反对下，理事会这一天并没有承认伊拉克共和国任命的合法代表贾瓦德的资格。
    由于日本代表说，他将就中东局势提出一项新提案，理事会最后决定在21日再次举行会议。
