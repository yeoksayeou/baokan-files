    Xinhua News Agency, July 29th dispatch from London: The "Daily Express" published a dispatch from its reporter in Beirut on the 28th, revealing that two British-made machine guns rushed to Beirut to protect the British Ambassador's residence are now on the front lines of the Lebanese insurgent forces, striking at imperialism and its agents.

    The report said that two Lebanese soldiers assigned to guard the Ambassador's residence had requested British-made machine guns, saying that their rifles were "completely unsuitable for dealing with insurgent personnel."

    Therefore, Britain specially transported two machine guns from Cyprus. However, as soon as the two soldiers got the guns, they disappeared, along with the weapons.

    两挺英国制机关枪变成黎起义者武器
    据新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：“每日快报”28日刊载它的记者从贝鲁特发出的消息透露，两支赶送到贝鲁特去保护英国大使官邸的英国制机关枪，现在正在黎巴嫩起义部队的阵地上打击帝国主义和它的代理人。
    消息说，两个被派去警卫这个大使的官邸的黎巴嫩士兵曾经要求发给他们英国制的机关枪，他们说，他们的步枪“要对付起义部队人员是完全不适合的”。
    于是，英国就特地从塞浦路斯运去了两支机关枪。但是，等到这两个士兵一拿到枪，就连人带枪都不见了。
