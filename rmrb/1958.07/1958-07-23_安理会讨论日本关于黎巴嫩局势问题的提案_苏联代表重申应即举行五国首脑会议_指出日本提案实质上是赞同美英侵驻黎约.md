Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd dispatch from New York: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the afternoon of the 21st to discuss the Lebanese situation. The Security Council discussed the Japanese proposal and the suggestion to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly.

The Japanese proposal, widely touted as a "reconciliation proposal," did not include a demand for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops. Under its ambiguous wording, the proposal grants the UN Secretary-General the right to send foreign troops to Near Eastern countries, effectively allowing interference in the internal affairs of these countries under the guise of the United Nations.

The Japanese proposal suggests:

	I.  Requests the UN Secretary-General to “make immediate arrangements” to take, in addition to measures stipulated in the Security Council resolution on dispatching UN observers to Lebanon, and “such additional measures as he may find necessary for the purpose of ensuring the overall objectives outlined in that resolution,”
	“These measures will be based on the UN charter with respect to preserving the territorial integrity and political independence of Lebanon, so that a withdrawal of United States forces from Lebanon will become possible.”

	II. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council on arrangements made.
	III. Requests the Governments concerned to cooperate fully in the implementation of the resolution.

In presenting his proposal, Japanese representative Koto Matsudaira insisted that the Japanese proposal did not in any way stipulate the establishment and dispatch of UN armed forces to Lebanon, and that its purpose was merely to "strengthen" the UN observer group in Lebanon.

The representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Canada expressed support for the Japanese proposal.

UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld said that it was difficult for him at this point to specify exactly the measures necessary to implement the Japanese proposal, but that these measures would essentially consist of expanding the current UN observer group in Lebanon as much as possible.

Swedish representative Jarring said that Sweden felt it could support the Japanese proposal, although he also acknowledged that with US troops stationed in Lebanon, the activities of UN observers in Lebanon "blurred the distinction between UN observers and American soldiers."

Soviet representative Sobolev, in his speech, analyzed the Japanese proposal in detail. This proposal was put forward after the US proposal to establish UN armed forces had failed.

Sobolev emphasized that the proposal did not include a demand for the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The proposal suggests expanding the activities of the UN observer group in Lebanon while US troops are stationed there, which the Security Council cannot tolerate. A UN observer group cannot be maintained in Lebanon while US troops are stationed there.

Sobolev went on to point out that the Japanese proposal requires that, in addition to expanding the UN observer group's activities in Lebanon, the UN Secretary-General should also take other "necessary" supplementary measures. Sobolev asked: What other measures could there be besides expanding the observer group? Unfortunately, neither the drafters of the proposal, nor the other representatives who supported it, explained this to us. In other words, people are suggesting to the Security Council that it blindly vote for this proposal.

Sobolev continued, it can be seen that this proposal in essence morally endorses the presence of US troops in Lebanon and British troops in Jordan, even though their presence in these countries is illegal and violates the UN Charter.

Sobolev said: The Soviet delegation cannot support the proposal put forward by the Japanese delegation. He said: The Soviet government believes that this is a question of war or peace, and therefore the Soviet Union insists on immediately convening the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France and India, with the participation of the UN Secretary-General, in order to take prompt measures to stop the military conflict that has already begun.

The Soviet government also suggested that the heads of government formulate specific recommendations on stopping the military conflict in the Middle East and submit them to the Security Council, which would then discuss these recommendations with the participation of representatives of Arab countries.

Canadian representative, Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs Smith, agreed with the Soviet proposal to immediately convene a summit to discuss the Middle East situation. He said that the situation is now very dangerous and that no country should close the door on negotiations that could help ease tensions. He called for a summit to discuss the Near East situation as soon as possible.

Lebanese representative Azkoul once again attempted to justify the US armed intervention in Lebanon, reiterating his attempt to prove that the United Arab Republic was "infiltrating" Lebanon.

United Arab Republic representative Loutfi refuted the remarks of the US and Lebanese representatives. He said: The accusations against the United Arab Republic are just pretexts to justify US armed intervention. The real reason for the intervention is the situation in Iraq. He also said: The real threat to peace in the Middle East and the world is the attitude of the Jordanian government, because the Jordanian government is still talking about "liberating Iraq."

After Loutfi's speech, US representative Lodge suggested that the Security Council adjourn the meeting. The Soviet representative opposed the US representative's attempt to delay. However, the Security Council, despite the Soviet representative's opposition, adjourned the meeting.

The next meeting is scheduled for the morning of July 22.

### 安理会讨论日本关于黎巴嫩局势问题的提案  苏联代表重申应即举行五国首脑会议  指出日本提案实质上是赞同美英侵驻黎约

    安理会讨论日本关于黎巴嫩局势问题的提案
    苏联代表重申应即举行五国首脑会议
    指出日本提案实质上是赞同美英侵驻黎约
    新华社22日讯  据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会21日下午举行会议讨论黎巴嫩局势。安理会讨论了日本提出的提案和关于召开联合国大会紧急会议的建议。
    被广泛吹嘘为“和解提案”的日本提案没有包括要求立即撤出外国军队的主张。这个提案在含糊的措词下给予联合国秘书长以派遣外国军队到近东国家去的权利。也就是允许在联合国的幌子下对这些国家的内政进行干涉。
    日本提案建议：
    一、要求联合国秘书长“立即作出安排”，以便除了采取安理会关于派遣联合国观察团到黎巴嫩的决议中所规定的措施以外，并且采取“为使联合国能够实现那个决议中所规定的总目的而认为必要的措施”，
  “这些措施将根据联合国宪章用来保证黎巴嫩的领土完整和政治独立，以便使美国军队从黎巴嫩撤退成为可能。”
    二、要求联合国秘书长就所作出的安排向安理会提出报告。
    三、要求有关各国政府对这项决议的执行给予充分的合作。
    日本代表松平康东在提出他的提案时硬说，日本的提案并没有以任何形式规定建立和向黎巴嫩派遣联合国武装部队，它的目的仅仅是“加强”联合国在黎巴嫩的观察团。
    美国、英国、法国和加拿大的代表表示支持日本的提案。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德说，他现在很难确切地提出为实现日本提案所必需的措施，不过，这些措施基本上将不外是尽量扩大现在在黎巴嫩的联合国观察团。
    瑞典代表雅林说，瑞典认为可以支持日本的提案，虽然他也承认，在美国军队驻扎在黎巴嫩的情况下，联合国观察员在黎巴嫩的活动“抹去了联合国观察员和美国士兵之间的区别。”
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言中详细分析了日本的提案。这个提案是在美国的关于建立联合国武装力量的提案破产以后提出的。
    索波列夫着重指出，这个提案没有包括关于从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退美国和英国军队的要求。这个提案建议在黎巴嫩驻有美国军队的情况下扩大联合国观察团的活动，这是安理会不能容忍的。不能在有美国军队驻扎在那里的情况下在黎巴嫩保留观察团。
    索波列夫接着指出，日本提案要求，除了扩大联合国观察团在黎巴嫩的活动之外，联合国秘书长还应该采取其他“必要”措施作为补充。索波列夫问道：除了扩大观察团之外，还能有什么样的其他措施呢？很遗憾，无论是提案起草人，无论是支持这个提案的其他代表都没有向我们讲明白这一点。换句话说，人们向安理会建议，盲目地为这个提案投票。
    索波列夫接着说，由此可见，这个提案在实质上意味着在道义上赞同美国军队驻扎在黎巴嫩、赞同英国军队驻扎在约旦，虽然它们驻扎在这些国家是非法的和违反联合国宪章的。
    索波列夫说：苏联代表团不能支持日本代表团提出的提案。他说：苏联政府认为，这是一个战争还是和平的问题，因此苏联坚持立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、美、英、法、印五国政府首脑会议，以便迅速采取措施来停止已经开始的军事冲突。
    苏联政府还建议，各国政府首脑会议拟定关于停止中东军事冲突的具体建议，并且把这种建议提交给安全理事会，然后由安理会在有阿拉伯国家代表参加的情况下讨论这种建议。
    加拿大代表、加拿大外交部长史密斯表示同意苏联提出的关于立即召开最高级会议讨论中东局势的建议。他说，局势现在十分危险，任何国家也不能对有助于缓和紧张局势的谈判关闭大门。他要求由最高级会议讨论近东局势，而且愈快愈好。
    黎巴嫩代表阿兹考尔再一次企图为美国武装干涉黎巴嫩寻找口实，他再度企图证明，阿拉伯联合共和国正在“渗入”黎巴嫩。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表卢特菲反驳了美国和黎巴嫩代表的言论。他说：对阿拉伯联合共和国的指责只是为美国武装干涉进行辩解的借口。进行干涉的真正原因是伊拉克的局势。他还说：对中东和全世界和平的真正威胁是约旦政府的态度，因为约旦政府还在谈论“解放伊拉克”。
    卢特菲发言之后，美国代表洛奇建议安理会停止会议。苏联代表表示反对美国代表这种企图拖延时间的建议。但是，安理会不顾苏联代表的反对，终于停止了会议。
    下次会议定在7月22日上午举行。
