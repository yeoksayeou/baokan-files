Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 18th - The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the evening of the 17th, condemning the US armed intervention in Lebanon.

The statement expressed support for the just struggle of the people of Lebanon and Arab countries to defend their independence and sovereignty, and demanded that the United States immediately withdraw its troops from Lebanon.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully agrees with the statements issued by the governments of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China regarding support for the national liberation struggle of Arab countries against imperialist intervention.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 19th - The government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement late on the 18th, protesting the aggressive acts of US-British imperialism in the Near and Middle East, and called on all German people to do their utmost to support the Arab people's anti-imperialist national liberation struggle.

The statement pointed out that the situation created by imperialist aggression in the Near and Middle East has brought the world to the brink of war.

The statement pointed out that the government of West Germany, as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is supporting the aggressive actions of the US and Britain in various ways. It has provided the largest airport on West German territory as an important departure base for US aggressor troops, and has also provided military assistance in other ways. The West German government has thus participated and is continuing to participate in the preparation and execution of aggression against Arab countries; this once again proves the hypocrisy of the West German government's claim that it has goodwill towards the Arab nations. The West German government's act of acting as an accomplice to US aggression must be condemned.

The statement said that the peace and security of all peoples are in danger. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the government of the German Democratic Republic strongly protests the US-British aggressive actions in the Middle East and demands the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from the Middle East.

The statement said that the government of the German Democratic Republic has written to the West German government, asking it to take necessary measures immediately to prevent West German troops from being involved in a dirty war against the peace-loving Arab people. The government of the German Democratic Republic also demanded that the West German government not provide West German territory as a base for US-British aggressive actions.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 17th - The Czechoslovak government issued a statement on the 17th, strongly condemning the US armed intervention in Lebanon. The statement emphasized that the US government must bear full responsibility for the consequences of this act of aggression.

The Czechoslovak government expressed its firm belief that the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly have a responsibility to take effective measures to restore peace in the Near and Middle East, in order to compel the United States to cease its interference in Lebanon and immediately withdraw its intervention troops.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, July 17th - The Bulgarian government issued a statement on the 17th, warmly welcoming the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, and severely condemning the US imperialist blatant interference in the internal affairs of the Arab countries.

The statement said that the Bulgarian government and all the people are deeply disturbed by the US blatant and open aggression against the Lebanese people, which is quite natural, because Bulgaria is a close neighbor of the Near and Middle East.

The statement said that the Bulgarian government firmly demands that the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council take necessary measures to compel the United States to immediately cease its armed aggression in the Arab East, and to compel the withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 19th - The newspapers here today published the statement issued by the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government on the situation in the Near and Middle East. The statement condemned the US military intervention in Lebanon, and believes that the US government and its accomplices must be held responsible for the aggression and the threat to peace in the Near and Middle East and the world.

The statement believes that the facts show that the US, Britain and other Western countries have long planned to launch an all-out offensive against the national independence movement in the Arab region. The statement said that during the invasion of Egypt, imperialist elements organized a counter-revolutionary riot in Hungary. Since then, imperialist elements have continued to use the method of slandering the Hungarian people to divert world public opinion from their aggressive plans and conspiracies.

The Hungarian government stated in its statement that it will at all times do its best to support the struggle of the colonial people and the countries that have been liberated to defend their independence, and it fully supports the proposal made by the Soviet government to the Security Council.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 18th - The Albanian government issued a statement on the 18th on the imperialist aggression against the Near and Middle East, resolutely condemning the US-British imperialist aggression against the Lebanese people and other Arab peoples, and demanding that the United States and Britain immediately withdraw their aggressor troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

The statement said that the US aggression against Lebanon is also directed against the Iraqi people and other Arab peoples, and this aggression was pre-planned and coordinated with other colonial countries. This is an integral part of the aggressive policy of Western oil monopoly capital.

The statement said that the Albanian government is directly concerned about maintaining peace in this neighboring region, and cannot but express its anxiety and concern about these dangerous events developing in the Near and Middle East. The Albanian government condemns all aggressive activities of imperialist countries in the Near and Middle East, and demands an immediate end to this war adventure that greatly worsens the international situation and openly threatens peace. It also demands that the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly immediately take effective measures to stop the aggression and compel the complete withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon and the complete withdrawal of British troops from Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 18th - The Indonesian government issued a statement on the 18th on the situation in the Middle East, saying that the Indonesian government believes that the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan will help to finally resolve the Middle East crisis. The Indonesian government calls for foreign countries not to interfere in the situation in Iraq for the benefit of the Iraqi people, which will give the Iraqi people the opportunity to freely decide their own destiny according to their own wishes.

The statement said that the Indonesian government believes that the United Nations is the best organization to resolve all crises in the Middle East. The Indonesian government finds it difficult to agree with any actions that violate the United Nations Charter. The statement said that in the current international situation, the intervention of any great power on one side would easily lead the other side to take the same action, which would bring various disasters to mankind.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 18th - A spokesman for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs issued the following statement to reporters here tonight:

"The Indian government opposes the intervention of foreign troops in any country and believes that foreign troops should withdraw. Especially in Lebanon, the United Nations Observer Group has reported that they can enter all areas of the border, and the Indian government believes that the Observer Group should be allowed to continue to perform their mission. This will be a guarantee against the infiltration of foreign elements, and therefore the US sending troops to prevent external threats to the Lebanese government is unnecessary. If necessary, the Observer Group can be strengthened."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 19th - According to the Indian Press Trust of Ceylon report from Colombo: Ceylonese Prime Minister Bandaranaike issued a statement today, calling for the United Nations to intervene immediately to prevent the further deterioration of the situation in the Middle East, and to make the US and British troops withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

He said in a statement that he has instructed the Ceylonese representative to the United Nations, Claude Corea, to take urgent measures to request the United Nations General Assembly to convene an emergency meeting to discuss the entire issue.

    欧亚九国政府发表声明
    要美英侵略军撤出中东
    越南
    据新华社河内18日电　越南民主共和国政府在17日晚上发表声明，谴责美国对黎巴嫩的武装干涉。
    声明表示支持黎巴嫩和阿拉伯各国人民为保卫自己的独立和主权而进行的正义斗争，并且要求美国立刻从黎巴嫩撤军。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府完全赞成苏联和中华人民共和国的政府发表的关于支持阿拉伯各国为反对帝国主义的干涉而进行的民族解放斗争的声明。
    民主德国
    据新华社柏林19日电　德意志民主共和国政府在18日深夜发表声明，抗议美英帝国主义在中近东的侵略行为，并且号召全德人民竭尽全力支持阿拉伯人民反帝的民族解放斗争。
    声明指出，由于帝国主义在中近东的侵略而造成的局势已经把世界带到了战争的边缘。
    声明指出，作为北大西洋集团成员国的西德的政府正在用各种方法支持美英的侵略行动。它提供了西德领土上的最大机场充作美国侵略军的重要出发基地，并且还以其他方式提供了军事援助。西德政府就这样参加了和正在继续参加着对阿拉伯国家侵略的准备和执行；这就再一次证明了西德政府所谓它对阿拉伯民族抱有好感的说法是伪善的。西德政府这种替美国的侵略充当帮凶的行为必须受到谴责。
    声明说，各国人民的和平和安全正处在危险中。鉴于局势的严重性，民主德国政府对美英在中东的侵略行动提出强烈的抗议，并且要求立刻从中东地区撤退外国军队。
    声明说，民主德国政府已经写信给西德政府，要求它立即采取必要措施，以便阻止西德军队卷入一个反对爱好和平的阿拉伯人民的肮脏战争。民主德国政府还要求西德政府不提供西德领土作为美英侵略行动的基地。

    声明说，保加利亚政府坚决要求联合国大会和安全理事会采取必要措施，促使美国立即停止在阿拉伯东方的武装侵略，促使美国军队撤出黎巴嫩。
    匈牙利

    声明认为，事实说明，美英及其他西方国家早已策划要向阿拉伯地区的民族独立运动发起总进攻。声明说，在侵略埃及的时候，帝国主义分子在匈牙利组织了反革命暴乱。从那时以后，帝国主义分子仍然用诽谤匈牙利人民的办法来转移世界舆论对其侵略计划和阴谋的注意。
    匈牙利政府在声明中表示，在任何时候它都将尽力支持殖民地人民和已经解放了的国家保卫独立的斗争，它完全支持苏联政府向安全理事会提出的建议。
    阿尔巴尼亚
    据新华社地拉那18日电　阿尔巴尼亚政府18日就帝国主义对中近东的侵略发表声明，坚决谴责美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩人民和其他阿拉伯人民的侵略，要求美国和英国立即把侵略军撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    声明说，美国对黎巴嫩的侵略同时也是针对伊拉克人民和其他阿拉伯人民的，这次侵略是同其他殖民国家预先策划和配合好的。这是西方石油垄断资本的侵略政策的一个组成部分。
    声明说，阿尔巴尼亚政府直接关心维护这个邻近地区的和平，不能不对中近东发展中的这些危险事件表示不安和关心。阿尔巴尼亚政府谴责帝国主义国家在中近东地区的一切侵略活动，并且要求立即停止这种大大恶化国际局势和公开威胁和平的战争冒险。它并且要求安全理事会和联合国大会立即采取有效的措施来制止侵略和促使美国军队完全撤出黎巴嫩、英国军队完全撤出约旦。
    印度尼西亚
    据新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚政府在18日就中东局势发表声明说，印度尼西亚政府认为，外国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦将有助于使中东危机得到最后解决。印度尼西亚政府呼吁，为了伊拉克人民的利益，外国不要干预伊拉克局势，这将使伊拉克人民有机会自由地根据他们自己的愿望来决定他们自己的命运。
    声明说，印度尼西亚政府认为联合国是解决中东一切危机的最好的机构。印度尼西亚政府很难同意违反联合国宪章的一切行动。声明说，在目前的国际形势下，任何一方的大国的干涉行动都会很容易地使另一方采取同样行动，这样就会使人类遭到各种灾难。
    印度
    据新华社新德里18日电　印度政府外交部发言人今晚在这里向新闻记者发表了如下的声明：
    “印度政府反对外国军队干涉任何国家并且认为外国军队应当撤退。尤其是在黎巴嫩，联合国观察团已经提出报告说他们可以进入边境所有地区，印度政府认为应当允许观察团继续执行他们的任务。这将是防止外国分子渗入的保证，因此美国派遣军队防止外界对黎巴嫩政府的威胁的做法是没有必要的。如果必要的话，观察团可以予以加强。”
    锡兰
    据新华社新德里19日电　据印度报业托辣斯科伦坡消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克今天发表声明，要求联合国立即进行干预，以防止中东局势进一步恶化，并且使得美英两国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
