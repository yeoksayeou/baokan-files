　　Leshan Dispatch, July 6th: (Reporters Shao Tingjun and Li Shao Yi) In order to thoroughly change the backward state of existing land and water transportation and meet the needs of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, Sichuan Province has launched a mass movement for a technological revolution in transportation.

　　The technological revolution in local transportation in Sichuan Province focuses on motorizing rural transportation, mechanizing water transportation, and forming automobile trains in motor vehicle transportation. At the same time, it implements the use of rubber tires and rolling bearings on vehicles, animal carrying and cable cars in high mountain areas, bridges at river crossings, and mechanization and semi-mechanization of handling work and construction and maintenance. This transportation "seven transformations" technological revolution includes revolutionizing transportation power, revolutionizing transportation methods, transforming folk transportation tools, as well as improving process regulations, operating methods, and adopting new technologies.

　　Motorizing rural transportation is a great revolution in rural transportation methods. The traditional method of human carrying, which has existed for thousands of years, is still the main mode of transportation in rural Sichuan, especially in mountainous areas and fields. The labor force used by farmers throughout the province for short-distance transportation and field transportation accounts for more than 30% of the total agricultural labor force for the year, and in some areas it is as high as 60% to 70%. Therefore, changing backward transportation methods, reducing physical labor, improving transportation efficiency, and liberating a large amount of labor has become an urgent matter for Sichuan Province to develop agricultural production. At present, an average of more than one million farmers across the province participate in road construction and vehicle manufacturing activities every day. Many counties, districts, and townships have already realized the motorization of roads, and most areas of the province will be able to realize motorization of roads ahead of schedule this autumn and winter. In Xichong County, everyone builds roads and every household makes cars. After ten days and nights of hard work, 5,100 roads were built, totaling more than 4,400 kilometers, and more than 20,000 vehicles of various types were built. The county has realized the motorization of roads, which can save 24 million labor days a year.

　　The technological revolution in water transportation in Sichuan Province includes developing inland river steamers and transforming existing wooden boats. At present, wooden boats are still one of the main transportation tools in Sichuan Province, and the annual volume of transportation accounts for more than one-third of all transportation tools in the province. Therefore, the most basic method of the technological revolution in water transportation throughout the province is to make full use of existing wooden boats, vigorously carry out technological transformation of wooden boats, change the labor methods of human trackers and punting, carry out power revolution, and implement coal gas motorization of wooden boats and motorized wooden boat towing transportation. At present, coal gas motorization and towing have been piloted on the main waterways of the province, and factories in Chongqing, Chengdu and other places are manufacturing coal gas engines for the shipping department in large quantities. In June, a 60-ton wooden boat powered by a 90-horsepower coal gas engine sailed upstream from Chongqing to Hechuan on the Jialing River. It sailed for twelve hours, carrying 45 tons of cargo, using a total of seven workers and burning 700 kilograms of coal. The same wooden boat carrying the same amount of cargo requires 33 people to push the boat, sailing for five days, requiring a total of 165 people. Compared with the two, the motorization of wooden boats increased transportation efficiency by four times, saved 80% of the labor force, and reduced transportation costs by 40%.

　　The method of automobile train transportation is to give full play to the traction of existing automobiles. By adding one or more trailers, the transportation efficiency of automobiles can be increased several times. According to the results already promoted in Chengdu, Ya'an, Luzhou, Wanxian and other places, a Jiefang brand automobile can tow more than three trailers with a load of three tons at a time. Sichuan Province summarized the benefits of implementing automobile train transportation: transportation efficiency can be increased several times; transportation costs can be reduced by 40%; a large amount of automobile purchase costs, management fees and labor can be saved; at the same time, trailer manufacturing is relatively easy, and bamboo and wood structures can be used as substitutes, saving national steel.

　　The province is also promoting the use of rubber tires and rolling bearings on vehicles to gradually convert all folk transportation tools such as pushcarts, wheelbarrows, and animal-powered vehicles throughout the province into rubber-coated wheels and rolling bearings. This can increase the original transportation efficiency by two times. At present, a factory with an annual output of one million sets of rolling bearings has been built in Chengdu, and a factory with an annual output of two million sets of rubber tires is being planned. Special zones and counties are also building such factories. In mountainous areas where the conditions for realizing road motorization are poor, animal carrying is being developed in large quantities, and slides and cableways have been built in many high mountain areas. The handling and construction departments have massively promoted small-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization tools such as wooden rail cars, soil crushers, and soil unloading machines to gradually eliminate manual labor such as carrying, lifting, and back carrying. In the highway ferry crossings throughout the province, especially in ferry crossings with more traffic such as Guangyuan and Hechuan, permanent, semi-permanent or temporary bridges have been or are being prepared to be built to eliminate the phenomenon of waiting for ferries or being affected by natural factors and stopping ferries, and to accelerate the turnover rate of vehicles.

　　At present, the technological revolution movement in local transportation in Sichuan Province is developing rapidly. The transportation departments in various regions are strengthening mutual assistance and cooperation, and vigorously improving labor organization and management systems.

### 四川省掀起一个群众性的运动  水陆运输技术大革命  重点是：肩挑改车运、木船装机械、汽车挂拖车

    四川省掀起一个群众性的运动
    水陆运输技术大革命
    重点是：肩挑改车运、木船装机械、汽车挂拖车
    本报乐山6日电　记者邵挺军、李绍伊报道：四川省为了彻底改变现有水陆交通运输的落后状况，适应工农业大跃进的需要，掀起了一个群众性的交通运输技术大革命的运动。
    四川省地方交通运输的技术革命运动，是以农村运输车子化，水上运输机械化，汽车运输列车化为重点，同时实行车子胶带化和转动轴承化，高山地区运输驮运化和索道化，渡口桥梁化，搬运工作和施工维修机械化、半机械化。这个交通运输“七化”技术革命运动的内容包括了运输动力革命，运输方式革命，民间运输工具的改造，以及改进工艺规程，操作方法和采用新技术等。
    农村运输车子化是农村运输方式的大革命。几千年传统的人背肩挑，现在仍然是四川农村运输，特别是山区和田间运输的主要方式。全省农民每年用在短途运输和田间运输的劳动力约占全年农业所用劳动力的30％以上，有的地区竟高达60％——70％。因此，改变落后的运输方式，减轻体力劳动，提高运输效率，把大量的劳动力解放出来，就成为四川省发展农业生产的当务之急。目前，全省每天平均有百万以上的农民参加修路造车的活动，许多县、区、乡已经实现了道路车子化，今年秋冬全省大部分地区都可提前实现车子化。西充县人人修路，户户造车，苦战十昼夜，筑路五千一百条，总长四千四百多公里，造出各种车子两万多辆，全县已实现了道路车子化，一年就可节约二千四百万个劳动日。
    四川省水上运输技术革命包括发展内河轮船和改造现有木船两个方面。目前，木船仍然是四川省的主要运输工具之一，年运量占全省各种交通运输工具的三分之一以上。因此，全省水上运输技术革命最基本的作法，是充分利用现有木船，对木船大力进行技术改造，改变木船人力拉纤撑篙的劳动方法，进行动力革命，实行木船煤气机动化和机动木船拖带运输。现在，全省各主要航道已试行木船煤气机动化和拖运化，重庆、成都等地工厂正在为航运部门大量制造煤气机。6月份，嘉陵江一艘以九十马力煤气机为动力的六十吨木船，由重庆上水行驶到合川，航行十二小时，载货四十五吨，共用七个人工，燃煤七百公斤；而同样的木船装同量的货用人工推船则需三十三个人，航行五天，共需一百六十五个人工。两相比较，木船机动化提高了运输效率四倍，节省劳动力80％，降低运输成本40％。
    汽车列车运输化的做法，是充分发挥现有汽车的牵引力，加挂一个或几个拖车，就能成倍地提高汽车的运输效率。据成都、雅安、泸州、万县等地已经推行的结果，一部解放牌汽车一次可以拖带载重三吨的挂车三个以上，四川省总结实行汽车列车化以来的好处是：运效可以成倍提高；运输成本可以降低40％；可以节约大量的汽车购置费、管理费和劳动力；同时挂车制造比较容易，可以采用竹、木结构代用品，节约国家钢材。
    这个省还正在推行车子胶带化和转动轴承化，要把全省的架架车、独轮车、兽力车等民间运输工具都逐步改为胶带包轮，用滚珠轴承转动，这样可以比原来的运输效率提高两倍。目前已在成都市建成了一座年产一百万套滚珠轴承的工厂，并正在筹建一座年产两百万套胶带的工厂。各个专区、县也在建设这类工厂。在实现道路车子化条件较差的山区，正在大量发展驮运，许多高山区建设了滑道和索道。搬运部门和施工部门大量推行了木轨车、土碎石机、土卸货机等小型机械化和半机械化的工具，逐步消灭挑、抬、背、提的人工劳动。在全省公路渡口，特别是行车较多的渡口如广元、合川等地，已经或正在准备修建永久性、半永久性或临时性的桥梁，以消灭待渡或受自然因素影响而停渡的现象，加速车辆的周转率。
    目前，四川省地方交通运输的技术革命运动，正在一日千里地向前发展。各个地区的交通运输部门都加强互助协作，并大力改进劳动组织和管理制度。
