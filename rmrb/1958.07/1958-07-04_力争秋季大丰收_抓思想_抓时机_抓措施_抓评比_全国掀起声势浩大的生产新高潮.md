Strive for a Bumper Autumn Harvest
    Grasp Ideology, Seize Opportunities, Implement Measures, and Conduct Evaluations
    A Nationwide Upsurge of a Vigorous New Production High Tide

    (Our dispatch) Amidst the cheers of a good harvest, from the South to the North of the motherland, the broad masses of peasants, inspired by the General Line, are working with sky-high enthusiasm, and a vigorous agricultural production high tide is forming, striving for an even greater bumper harvest in the autumn.

    Guangdong: A Million Mu of High-Yield Rice Experimental Field Movement
    The Shantou Special District, a nationally famous high-yield rice area, has organized a million-mu high-yield rice experimental field movement with the participation of ten million people in late rice production. This movement has driven the entire late-season production, creating a high tide of agricultural technology revolution throughout the district. The characteristics of this million-mu high-yield experimental field movement in Shantou Special District are: large scale, large number of participants, and high targets. The entire special district planned to cultivate 1,155,000 mu of experimental fields, but after mobilizing the masses in all 17 counties and cities, the figures exceeded the original plan. Chao'an County alone proposed to cultivate 150,000 mu, accounting for 48% of the county's late rice area. Currently, after the basic completion of the summer harvest in the Chaoshan Plain, the counties have immediately shifted to plowing and tilling the land, fiercely attacking the first hurdle of increasing late-season production—deep plowing and application of ample fertilizer. According to statistics from Chao'an, Jieyang, Puning, Chaoyang, and Huilai counties alone, as of June 17, over 96,000 mu of land had been plowed and tilled, with the soil layer generally plowed to a depth of six or seven inches or more in fields with thick soil.
    Although Shaoguan Special District has high mountains and cold water, a short growing season, and has traditionally practiced extensive cultivation, this year, under the leadership of the Party, the peasants have displayed soaring enthusiasm, and early rice production has also achieved a great leap forward. It is estimated that the yield per mu of early rice can reach 400 jin, an increase of more than 50% compared to 262 jin in the same period last year.

    Zhejiang: Overcoming the Thought of Retrogression to Double Grain Production
    The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee recently convened a provincial three-level cadre conference to study and discuss the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction. The atmosphere at the meeting was filled with enthusiasm, and more than 1,200 participants expressed their determination to fight alongside the people of the province for 100 days to double both grain production and industrial output value. More than 200 people spoke at the meeting, unanimously pointing out that striving for high yields of food crops has become a realistic issue, and citing the high-yield records at home and abroad, explaining that striving to double crop yields is entirely possible. The meeting pointed out that, for example, in Cixi County in the autumn of 1956, it suffered an unprecedented severe typhoon disaster, and the output value per mu of cotton fields was only 20 yuan, while the cost was 16 yuan, and 90% of the commune members became overspending households, with an average debt of 80 yuan per household. This difficulty should be said to be very great, but the cadres of Cixi County did not retreat, they resolutely led the masses to engage in production for self-salvation, and as a result, not only did they overcome the disaster, but in 1957 they became a nationally famous "Hundred-Jin Cotton County." The conference pointed out that in the struggle to "double," there is a struggle between two kinds of thinking, promotion and retrogression, and ideological exchanges must be carried out, enthusiasm must be boosted, the masses must be resolutely relied on, all difficulties must be overcome, and the pessimism of the retrogression faction must be completely bankrupt, so as to realize an all-round leap forward in agricultural production.

    Guangxi: Striving for Thousand-Jin Counties and Thousand-Jin Special Districts
    The broad masses of peasants in the region are launching a movement to strive for thousand-jin counties and thousand-jin special districts. Farmers in many areas have proposed to strive to achieve "Beijing mu" and go to Beijing after the autumn with the best production results to meet Chairman Mao.
    All counties, townships, and communes in Guilin Special District have successively launched a campaign to accumulate fertilizer. Within a few days, the average amount of fertilizer accumulated per mu of late rice in the entire special district reached 10,016 dan (including sweet potatoes, an average of more than 5,400 dan).
    Yongning Special District recently put forward the slogan "Try every means to achieve a thousand-jin special district this year, and strive for counties to go to Beijing to participate in the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction." The Yongning Prefectural Party Committee convened a regional telephone conference on June 25. Comrade Gan Huaixun, the first secretary, pointed out at the meeting that there are three bases for achieving a thousand-jin per mu special district: first, the total grain output of the special district in the first half of the year will increase by more than 500 million jin compared with the same period in 1957. Second, the special district has transplanted 1.8 million to 2 million mu of mid-season rice and 3 million mu of late rice. As long as twice as much fertilizer is applied as early rice and all mid-row close planting is promoted, it is entirely possible to achieve an average of 700 jin per mu. Third, 3.23 million mu of sweet potatoes, as long as deep plowing and more fertilizer are applied, an average yield of 5,000 jin per mu is not difficult (equivalent to 1,250 jin of grain). With the above three seasons of rice, plus corn, sweet potatoes, and small miscellaneous grains, the entire special district may reach an average of 1,069 jin per mu.

    Shanxi: A Bumper Wheat Harvest, Striving for an Even Greater Bumper Harvest in the Autumn
    On June 30, Shanxi Province held a radio conference to launch a general offensive to increase autumn grain production. About two million cadres and masses in the province listened to the live broadcast of the conference in an organized manner. The name of this conference was: "A Radio Conference to Strive for a Grain Yield of 300 Jin per Mu, a Cotton Yield of 80 Jin of Ginned Cotton per Mu, and an Oil Yield of 150 Jin per Mu in the Province." Comrade Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, spoke at the conference. He pointed out that the province has achieved an unprecedented bumper wheat harvest. It is estimated that the total output can reach 3.2 billion jin, an increase of 80% compared with 1957, and an increase of 33% compared with the bumper 1956. The yield per unit area can reach more than 190 jin. Comrade Tao Lujia also pointed out that this year's bumper wheat harvest was not achieved under favorable weather conditions, so there is no reason why a greater bumper harvest cannot be achieved in the autumn. He also emphasized that while striving for this year's bumper harvest, preparations should also be made for next year's production. The third quarter of this year should be regarded as the first quarter of next year, that is, in the second half of this year, all preparations should be made for a greater leap forward next year.
    At this general offensive conference, the speakers successively represented counties, townships, and communes in proposing the revised leap forward targets and measures for this year. Representatives from many areas also challenged each other. Yu County, with its mountains and thin soil, also proposed to catch up with Southern Shanxi and surpass Central Shanxi. Wang Mao, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Fenyang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, proposed to compete with Jieyu this year and strive for a cotton yield of 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

    Gansu: Promoting the Production-Increase Measures of Dingxi Special District
    A vigorous movement to strive for an average of 1,200 jin of grain per person this year is unfolding in Gansu Province. This was launched by the Gansu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China at a provincial telephone conference on June 19. According to the Dingxi Special District's leap forward plan to strive for an average of 1,200 jin of grain per person, the Provincial Party Committee believes that the Dingxi Special District's practice of striving to achieve a yield of 400 jin per mu is positive and reliable, and immediately introduced it at the provincial telephone conference. The main measures for Dingxi to achieve this target are as follows:
    (1) Conduct ideological debates by observing and comparing fields, summarizing the experience in spring plowing production and technological revolution;
    (2) Implement the eight measures to protect seedlings, such as grasping water conservancy, irrigation, and moisture conservation;
    (3) Actively carry out four tasks: tool reform, deep plowing of land, selection and retention of fine seeds, and proper summer harvest distribution. In addition, it is also necessary to prepare for a greater bumper harvest next year. The Provincial Party Committee believes that according to the practice of Dingxi Special District, all localities can implement it, and it is entirely possible to do so, and areas with good conditions can even exceed it. At the meeting, the important instructions of Comrade Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, were also conveyed. Comrade Zhang Zhongliang especially mentioned the need to correctly treat various difficulties that may arise in the work. He said that difficulties can promote people's progress, find ways, and seize every inch of land to insert red flags, seize every second to make a great leap forward, and transform and eliminate the three types of communes, overcome backwardness, otherwise it will be infinitely harmful.

    Qinghai: Vigorously Carry Out Field Management
    The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference on June 28, calling on the province to further launch a movement to increase agricultural production, and the whole Party and the whole people should ensure that the total grain output this year reaches 2.82 billion jin in one go, and strive to reach 3.15 billion jin. The average person can have 1,500 jin of grain. According to reports from various places, 36 thousand-jin townships, 162 thousand-jin communes, and 1.03 million mu of thousand-jin mu will appear in Qinghai this year. The meeting proposed that in order to achieve the goal of increasing production, it is necessary to fight hard for another one to two months and do the following main tasks well: (1) Vigorously do a good job in field management, carry out weeding, and apply a large amount of topdressing; (2) Break the rules and replant a large amount; (3) Do a good job in disaster prevention to ensure increased production and harvest.
    The meeting also proposed that another important task at present is to rush to repair water storage projects and accumulate a large amount of fertilizer to lay a solid foundation for a greater bumper harvest next year. In order to complete the task of storing an average of 300 cubic meters of water per mu of land, in addition to some people engaged in field management, more than 50% of the labor force should be organized into water storage projects.

    Inner Mongolia: Eliminate Backward Fields and Strive for a Large Area of Bumper Harvest
    On June 25, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice to the entire region "to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year and prepare for a greater bumper harvest next year." The notice requires that in terms of agricultural production, first strive for a bumper harvest of wheat and other early-maturing crops to start the first shot. All localities should try every means to tap the potential for increasing production and strive for a large area of bumper harvest. The specific requirements are to rank wheat, find out the backward seedlings and the reasons for the backwardness mu by mu, piece by piece, take effective measures, and eliminate the backward fields within a time limit. For autumn crops, it is necessary to do a good job in protecting seedlings, and to seize the opportunity to carry out weeding, summer hoeing, and thinning. In addition, it is also necessary to prevent the occurrence and harm of various natural disasters.
    Regarding a greater bumper harvest next year, the notice requires that first, water conservancy should be done well, and strive to achieve a water irrigation area of 15 million mu in 1959, with water conservancy completed in two years in three years. Second, fertilizer accumulation must be done well. It is required that 100% of the cultivated land in the entire region be fertilized in 1959, with a fertilization rate of 5,000 to 6,000 jin per mu, and areas with good conditions should exceed 10,000 jin. Third, preparations should be made for autumn plowing and autumn cultivation, with 30% deep plowing this year and full deep plowing next year. In addition, the notice also requires all localities to fully attach importance to the work of seed selection and agricultural tool reform.

    Heilongjiang: Resolutely Overcome Drought to Ensure a Bumper Harvest
    On June 29, the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee jointly convened a radio conference to overcome the threat of drought and ensure a bumper agricultural harvest. In addition to summarizing the major achievements made by the people of the province in the struggle against drought in the previous period, the conference called on the people of the province to continue to boost their energy, unite as one, resolutely fight the drought to the end, achieve a bumper harvest even without a drop of rain from the sky, and never give up until the drought is eliminated.
    According to incomplete statistics, the number of people participating in the fight against drought in the province has reached more than 1.22 million, watering 320,000 hectares of dry land.
    Comrade Yang Yichen, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Governor, requested in his speech at the radio conference that all localities must overcome complacency and paralysis before the downpour, show soaring enthusiasm, fight the drought heroically and stubbornly to the end, make every effort to protect seedlings, strive for a complete victory in the fight against drought, and ensure a bumper harvest.

    力争秋季大丰收
    抓思想　抓时机　抓措施　抓评比
    全国掀起声势浩大的生产新高潮
    本报讯　一片丰收声中，祖国从南到北，广大农民在总路线的鼓舞下，干劲冲天，一个声势浩大的、力争秋季获得更大丰收的农业生产高潮正在形成。
    广　东：百万亩水稻高产试验田运动
    全国著名的水稻高产区的汕头专区在晚稻生产中组织了一个千万群众参加的百万亩水稻高产试验田运动，这个运动带动了整个晚造生产，使得全区出现了一个农业技术革命的高潮。汕头专区这个百万亩高产试验田运动的特点是：规模大、人数多、指标高。全专区计划搞的试验田是一百一十五万五千亩，但全区十七个县市通过发动群众后，数字都比原计划大。潮安一个县就提出搞十五万亩，占全县晚稻面积的48％。目前，潮汕平原各县夏收基本结束后，随即转入了犁田翻土，猛攻晚造增产的第一关——深犁多肥。仅据潮安、揭阳、普宁、潮阳、惠来五个县至6月17日的统计就犁田翻土九万六千多亩，土层厚的田一般深耕六七寸以上。
    韶关专区虽然山高水冷，生产季节较短，一向耕作粗放，但今年农民在党的领导下，发挥冲天的干劲，早稻生产也实现了大跃进，预计早稻亩产可达四百斤，比去年同期二百六十二斤增加50％以上。
    浙　江：战胜促退思想实现粮食翻一番
    中共浙江省委最近召开全省三级干部大会，学习和讨论党的社会主义建设总路线，会上干劲冲天，与会一千二百多人，表示决心同全省人民一道奋战一百天，实现粮食产量和工业产值都翻一番。会上二百多人发言，一致指出，争取粮食作物的高额产量已经成为现实问题，并列举省内外出现的高额丰产纪录，说明争取作物产量翻一番，完全有实现的可能。会议指出：如像慈溪县1956年秋季遭受空前严重的台灾，每亩棉田产值只有二十元，而成本却花了十六元，90％的社员成为超支户，每户平均负债八十元。这个困难应该说是很大的，但慈溪县的干部没有退却，他们坚决领导群众生产自救，结果不但渡过了灾荒，而且在1957年成为全国闻名的“百斤棉县”。大会指出，在争取“翻一番”的斗争中，存在着促进和促退两种思想斗争，必须思想交锋，鼓足干劲，坚决依靠群众，克服一切困难，使促退派的悲观论彻底破产，实现农业生产的全面跃进。
    广　西：争取千斤县和千斤专区
    全区广大农民，正掀起一个力争千斤县、千斤专区的运动。不少地区的农民提出要争取实现“北京亩”，秋后带着最好生产成绩到北京去见毛主席。
    桂林专区各县各乡社都先后发起了突击积肥战斗。几天之内，全专区每亩晚稻平均积肥已达到一万零一十六担（连红薯在内平均五千四百多担）。
    邕宁专区最近提出“想尽一切办法，要在今年实现千斤专区，争取县县上北京参加全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议”的口号。邕宁地委于6月25日曾召开全区电话会议，第一书记甘怀勋同志在会上指出实现千斤亩专区有三个根据：第一，上半年全专区粮食总产量将比1957年同期增产五亿多斤。第二，全专区插中稻一百八十万到二百万亩，晚稻三百万亩，只要比早稻多施一倍肥料，全部推行中株密植，就完全可以达到平均每亩七百斤。第三，红薯三百二十三万亩，只要深耕和多加肥料，平均亩产五千斤并不困难（折谷一千二百五十斤）。以上三季水稻加上玉米、红薯和小杂粮，全专区可能达到平均每亩一千零六十九斤。山　西：小麦大丰收秋季要更大丰收
    6月30日，山西省举行了一次发起增产秋粮总进军的广播大会。全省约有二百万干部和群众，有组织地收听了大会实况。这次大会的名称就叫做：“为全省粮食亩产三百斤、棉花亩产皮棉八十斤、油料亩产一百五十斤而奋斗的广播大会”。省委第一书记陶鲁笳同志在大会上讲话。他指出全省小麦已获得空前大丰收，据估计总产量可达三十二亿斤，比1957年增产80％，比丰收的1956年也提高了33％，单位面积产量可达一百九十斤以上。陶鲁笳同志还指出今年小麦的丰收并不是在风调雨顺的情况下取得的，因此今年秋田就没有什么理由不能取得更大丰收。他还强调指出在争取今年丰收的同时，还要为明年的生产作好准备，应该把今年的第三季度当作明年的第一季度，即在今年下半年就为明年的更大跃进作好一切准备工作。
    在这次总进军的大会上，发言者都纷纷代表县、乡、社提出了今年修订后的跃进指标和措施。许多地区的代表还互相挑战。山多土薄的盂县，也提出要赶晋南，超晋中，中共汾阳县委农村工作部部长王茂提出今年要和解虞比高低，争取棉花亩产皮棉二百斤。
    甘　肃：推广定西专区的增产措施
    一个声势浩大的争取今年粮食平均每人一千二百斤的运动，正在甘肃省展开。这是6月19日中共甘肃省委在全省电话会议上发起的。根据该省定西专区力争每人平均粮食一千二百斤的跃进规划，省委认为定西专区争取亩产达到四百斤的做法是积极可靠的，立即在全省电话会议上作了介绍。定西实现这一指标的措施主要有以下几方面：
  （一）通过田间观摩评比、总结春耕生产、技术革命中的经验，展开思想辩论；（二）贯彻抓水利、抓灌溉、抓保墒等八项保苗措施；
  （三）积极开展工具改革、深翻土地、选留良种和做好夏收分配等四项工作。另外，还要为明年更大丰收做好准备。省委认为根据定西专区的做法，各地都可以实行，并且完全可能做到，条件好的地区还可以超过。在会上还传达了省委第一书记张仲良同志的重要指示，张仲良同志特别讲到要正确对待工作中可能出现的各种困难。他说困难可以推动人们进步，想办法，插红旗要寸土不让，大跃进要分秒必争，要改造消灭三类社，克服落后，否则就要贻害无穷。
    青　海：大力搞好田间管理
    中共青海省委6月28日召开电话会议，号召全省深入开展农业增产运动，全党全民要一鼓作气保证今年粮食总产量达到二十八亿二千万斤，争取达到三十一亿五千万斤。平均每人可有粮食一千五百斤。据各地汇报，青海今年将出现三十六个千斤乡，一百六十二个千斤社，千斤亩将达到一百零三万亩。会上提出要实现增产目标，还必须再苦战一个月至两个月，做好以下几件主要工作：（一）大力搞好田间管理，突击锄草，大量追肥；（二）打破常规，大量复种；（三）做好防灾工作，保证增产保收。
    会上还提出当前的另一重要任务是突击抢修蓄水工程和大量积肥造肥，为明年更大丰收打下可靠基础。为了完成每亩地平均蓄积三百公方水的任务，除了部分从事田间管理的人以外，要把50％以上的劳力组织到蓄水工程中来。内蒙古：消灭落后田争取大面积丰收
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会6月25日向全区发出“为争取今年农业大丰收，准备明年更大丰收”的通知。通知要求在农业生产方面，首先争取小麦和其他早熟作物丰收，打响第一炮。各地应千方百计挖掘增产潜力，争取大面积丰收。具体要求对小麦进行排队，逐亩逐块找出落后苗和造成落后的原因，采取有力措施，限期消灭落后田。对秋田作物，要做好保苗工作，抓紧铲趟、夏锄和间苗。此外，还要防止各种自然灾害的发生和危害。
    关于为明年更大丰收，通知要求首先做好兴修水利，争取1959年水地灌溉面积达到一千五百万亩，三年水利化两年完成。其次要做好积肥。要求1959年全区百分之百的耕地都施肥，每亩施肥量达五千斤到六千斤，条件好的地区要超过一万斤。第三要做好秋翻和秋耕准备，今年30％深翻，明年达到全部深翻。此外，通知还要求各地充分重视选种和改革农具的工作。
    黑龙江：坚决战胜旱灾确保大丰收
    6月29日，黑龙江省委和省人民委员会曾联合召开战胜旱灾威胁，确保农业大丰收的广播大会。会议除总结了前一时期全省人民抗旱斗争中所取得的重大成就外，号召全省人民继续鼓足干劲、万众一心，坚决与旱灾斗争到底，做到天无滴雨也丰收，旱象不除绝不罢休。
    据不完全统计，全省参加抗旱斗争的人数已达一百二十二万多人，浇出干旱土地三十二万公顷。
    省委书记、副省长杨易辰同志在广播大会的讲话中要求各地在下透雨以前，一定要克服松懈麻痹情绪，拿出冲天干劲，英勇顽强地同旱灾斗争到底，要全力保苗，力争抗旱全胜，确保丰收。
