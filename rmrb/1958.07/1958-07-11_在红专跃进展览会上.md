    At the Red and Expert Leap Forward Exhibition
    The Red and Expert Leap Forward Exhibition held by universities and secondary vocational schools in the capital has been open for eleven days since its opening on July 1st. Every day, thousands upon thousands of people come to visit.
    More than 110,000 students from universities and secondary vocational schools in the capital participated in work-study programs, producing 499 kinds of advanced products.
    So far, universities and secondary vocational schools in the capital have established 239 factories and workshops. It can be seen from the exhibition that the teaching work of many universities is closely integrated with production practice.
    Universities in the capital have established 2,171 political theory study groups. Teachers at Beijing Normal University, after five days and nights of hard work, compiled 150,000 words of "Mao Zedong's Psychological Thought," 120,000 words of "Mao Zedong's Educational Thought," and 250,000 words of "A Compilation of the Educational Thought of Li Dazhao, Qu Qiubai, Lu Xun, Yun Daiying, and Yang Xianjiang."
    There is also a very attractive place in the exhibition, that is, the Leap Forward Exhibition Room for Cadres Transferred to Lower Levels from Beijing Higher Education Institutions. In this shed made of reed mats, there are displayed the new achievements of 1,041 cadres transferred to lower levels from Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and Renmin University of China in the past six months in terms of labor training, ideological transformation, technical revolution, and cultural revolution.

    在红专跃进展览会上
    首都高等学校和中等专业学校举办的红专跃进展览会，从7月1日开幕，到今天已经十一天了。每天前往参观的人，成千上万。
    首都高等学校和中等专业学校十一万多学生参加勤工俭学，制造出四百九十九种先进产品。
    到目前为止，首都高等学校和中等专业学校创办的工厂和车间，已有二百三十九所。从展览会上可以看出，许多高等学校的教学工作都紧密地结合了生产实际。
    首都的高等学校已成立了二千一百七十一个政治理论学习小组。北京师范大学教师们，苦战五昼夜，编出了十五万字的“毛泽东同志的心理学思想”、十二万字的“毛泽东同志的教育思想”和二十五万字的“李大钊、瞿秋白、鲁迅、恽代英、杨贤江教育思想汇编”。
    在展览会上还有一个非常吸引人的地方，那就是北京高等院校下放干部跃进展览室。在这间芦席搭成的棚子里，陈列着半年多来北京大学、北京师范大学和中国人民大学一千零四十一个下放干部，在劳动锻炼、思想改造、技术革命、文化革命等方面的新成就。（附图片）
