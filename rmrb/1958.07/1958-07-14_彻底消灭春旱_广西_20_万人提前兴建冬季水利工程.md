    Thoroughly Eliminate Spring Drought
    Guangxi 200,000 People Start Winter Water Conservancy Projects Ahead of Schedule

    (Our Dispatch) Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has entered a new stage of completely eliminating drought. A large-scale water conservancy movement to weave a network of irrigation and strive to basically eliminate ordinary drought before the spring plowing next year has begun. At present, construction has started in 29 counties across the region. There are 132 large, medium, and small projects under construction, with more than 200,000 laborers working hard every day.

    Guangxi is located in the subtropics, with abundant sunshine and high temperatures. Although rainfall is plentiful, it is extremely uneven, often leading to droughts. Spring droughts have become a regular occurrence over the years. The spring drought of 1955 lasted from the winter of the previous year to late April of that year, and this year's spring drought has continued from last winter to June this year, with many areas yet to receive a thorough rain.

    The Autonomous Region held a water conservancy conference in May. The conference studied the patterns of drought, drew on the experience and lessons of past water conservancy construction, and formulated a water conservancy plan for this winter and next spring based on the characteristics of the region with its many mountains and rivers. The decision was made to focus on building dams on rivers with long-flowing water; to fully utilize underground water sources; and secondly, to intercept and store rainwater. Furthermore, river water, groundwater, and the originally built mountain ponds and reservoirs should be connected to form a "long vine with melons" style of gravity-fed irrigation network. In order to make full use of the rivers, this year it is also planned to develop 300,000 horsepower of water pumps, 20,000 kilowatts of small rural hydroelectric power generation, and other water lifting tools, densely distributed throughout the river basins. In this way, with canals and ditches connected, and ponds and reservoirs linked, there will be a source of living water everywhere, ensuring water is available whenever needed, and there is no fear of depletion, which will fundamentally change the face of water and drought disasters in Guangxi, providing a reliable guarantee for agricultural abundance.

    The task of water conservancy construction in the Autonomous Region this winter and next spring is to irrigate an area of more than 22 million mu, double the area from last winter and this spring. In order to complete this arduous task, after the water conservancy conference, from the special districts and counties to the townships, the secretaries or county heads and township heads took command, and the water conservancy projects that used to start in late winter and early spring were started as early as summer. This will ensure a successful battle in water conservancy construction this winter and next spring. Now, the water conservancy organizations in various places have been reorganized and improved, thousands of peasant technicians have been trained, and long-term water conservancy construction teams have been organized, adopting a method that combines river planning with regional planning, and combines mass reporting of projects with cadre technical guidance, to carry out water conservancy planning and surveying and design work. So far, the water conservancy planning and surveying work in most counties has been basically completed. One hundred and thirty-two projects have been started successively. This year, water conservancy construction further implements the mass line approach. Relevant departments are working together to vigorously plan for the preparation of materials and equipment. The cement required for various projects, in addition to the part supplied by the state, mainly relies on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and with the assistance of the communes, to solve the problem by using local materials. According to incomplete statistics, 30 counties across the region have successfully trial-produced low-grade cement, and some counties have established cement plants and put them into production. Gunpowder and all tools are also being organized by various places to manufacture themselves. Many places are mobilizing the masses to contribute iron and steel and raise funds themselves to solve the problem of the lack of steel.

    After the completion of the water conservancy tasks this winter and next spring, coupled with the current more than 10 million mu of paddy fields across the region with drought resistance capabilities of more than 70 days, more than 90% of the cultivated land area in the region will be free from ordinary drought disasters.

### 彻底消灭春旱  广西20万人提前兴建冬季水利工程

    彻底消灭春旱
    广西20万人提前兴建冬季水利工程
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区进入彻底消灭旱灾的新阶段，一个大规模的编织水利灌溉网，争取明年春耕前基本实现消灭普通旱灾的水利运动已经开始。目前全区已有二十九个县开始施工。开工的大、中、小型工程有一百三十二处，每天有二十多万劳动力在紧张的劳动着。
    广西地处亚热带，日照多，温度高，雨量虽多但极不均匀，往往形成旱灾。历年春旱已成规律。1955年春旱从头年的冬天延续到当年的4月下旬，今年的春旱更从去冬延续到今年6月份，不少地区至今尚未下过透雨。
    自治区在5月份召开了水利会议，会议研究了干旱的规律，吸取了过去水利建设的经验教训，根据境内山多、河流多的特点，制订了今冬明春的水利规划。决定兴修水利的重点是在长流水的河道上拦河筑坝；充分利用地下水源；其次是拦蓄天水。并且要把河水、地下水以及原来所修的山塘、水库连结起来，组成“长藤结瓜”式的自流灌溉网。为了充分利用江、河水，今年还计划发展抽水机三十万马力，农村小型水力发电二万瓩及其他提水工具，密布于各江河流域。这样，沟渠相通，塘库相连，处处有源头活水，就能保证何时要水，何时有水，不愁枯乏，将从根本上改变广西的水旱灾害面貌。为农业丰产提供可靠保证。
    自治区今冬明春兴修水利的任务是灌溉面积二千二百多万亩，比去冬今春增加一倍。为了完成这一艰巨任务，水利会议后，各地从专、县到乡，做到书记或县长、乡长挂帅，把往年冬末春初才开始动工的水利工程提早到夏天即开始动工。保证在今冬明春的水利建设上打一个漂亮仗。现在各地已重新整顿健全了水利机构，训练了数千名农民技术员，组织了长年兴修水利的基建队伍，采取以河流规划与地区规划相结合，群众报项目和干部技术指导相结合的办法，进行水利规划和勘测设计工作。到目前为止，大部分县的水利规划和勘测工作已基本结束。已先后开始施工的工程有一百三十二处。今年兴修水利进一步贯彻群众路线的方法，在物资器材的准备上有关部门正共同协作，大力筹划。各工程所需水泥，除国家供应一部分外，主要是依靠群众、发动群众、社办公助，就地取材来解决。据不完全统计，目前全区已有三十个县试制低标号水泥成功，有些县已建立了水泥厂投入生产。火药及一切工具，各地亦正在组织力量自己制造。很多地方正发动群众献铁献钢和自筹的办法来解决缺少钢铁的问题。
    今冬明春的水利任务完成后，加上目前全区约有一千多万亩抗旱能力达七十天以上的水田，全区将有90％以上的耕地面积免受普通旱灾。　　（李益芳）
