    Why Can Mynas Talk?
    Moke
    Parrots, mynas, and wrens are all birds that can talk.

    How can these birds speak human language? Anatomical studies have proven that they have developed vocal cords and relatively soft, fleshy, narrow, slender, and freely rotating tongues, as well as relatively developed cerebral cortices. These structures are the physiological basis for these birds' ability to learn to speak human language, which other birds lack. However, they can only imitate some simple human language because humans, in addition to vocal cords, also need the coordination of the tongue, lips, and teeth to produce sounds, while these birds only have a mouth and tongue and lack teeth and lips. Therefore, the human language they can imitate can only be the sounds made by humans using their mouth and tongue, such as "eat," "goodbye," "hello"... At most, they can also learn to imitate cat meows and dog barks. Sounds that require the coordination of teeth and lips, such as "lion" or "knowledge," are very difficult to learn, and they can only learn simple words of two or three syllables.

    To make these birds talk, they must be tamed and trained from a young age. Because the tips of mynas' and wrens' tongues are not as round as parrots', to teach a myna to talk, its tongue must be trimmed into a semi-circle like a human tongue. In addition to this, the most important thing is to follow the principle of "conditioned reflex," initially teaching them to whistle, letting them get used to vocalizing with us, and then teaching them simple words. Each sentence should be coordinated with human actions. For example, when you walk in the door, teach it to say: "Hello?" or "Who are you looking for?" When leaving, teach it "Goodbye!" When feeding it, teach it "Thank you." In this way, once training is successful, as long as you encounter the above human behaviors, stimulating its existing nerve reactions, they will automatically say the words they have been taught.

    Of course, these birds learning to speak human language is completely different from our unique human second signal – language, but is only a type of conditioned reflex. For birds, this allows them to adapt to the ever-changing environment in order to obtain their individual survival. Initially, they may not understand what they are saying, but over time, they can still understand. As Engels mentioned in his book "Dialectics of Nature": "...birds are the only animals that can learn to speak, and parrots, which have the most annoying voices among birds, speak the best. We should not say that parrots do not understand what they themselves are saying... but within the scope of what its imagination can reach, it can also learn to understand what it is saying..."

    八哥为什么会说话？
    莫克
    鹦鹉、八哥、鹪鹩都是会说话的鸟。
    这些鸟怎么会说人的话呢？从解剖学研究证明：它们有发达的声带和比较柔软多肉、狭长细小和转动流利的舌头，以及有比较发达的大脑皮层。这些构造，就是这些鸟能学人说话的生理基础，也是别的鸟所不及的。不过，它们只能模仿人的一些简单的语言，因为人除了声带外，还需要舌、唇、齿等配合发声，而这些鸟只有口腔和舌而缺齿唇。因此它们所能模仿的人语，只能是人用口腔、舌头所发的声音，如“吃饭”，“再见”，“你好”……至多还能学些猫喊狗叫。那些齿、唇配合的声音，如“狮子”、“知识”等就很不易学了，而且也只能学二、三个音的简单词。
    要使这些鸟会说话，必须从它们幼小的时候便开始驯养和训练。由于八哥、鹪鹩的舌尖没有鹦鹉那样圆，所以要八哥学话，必须把它的舌头修剪得跟人的舌头一样半圆。除此以外，最重要的便是按照“条件反射”的原理，最初教它吹口哨，让它们习惯于跟我们发声，然后才教它简单的话。每一句话应与人的行动配合。例如当你走进门时，教它说：“你好？”或“找谁？”出门时教它“再见！”给食时教“谢谢”。这样，一经训练成功，只要遇到上述人的行为，刺激它已有的神经反应，它们就会自动说出教给它们的话了。
    这些鸟会学人说话，当然完全不同于我们人类特有的第二讯号——语言，而只不过是一种条件反射。在鸟类来说，使其本身要能适应多变的环境，以便获得它个体的生存罢了。最初，它们也许不明白自己说的是什么意思，久而久之，还是能懂得的。正如恩格斯在“自然辩证法”一书中所提到的“……鸟是唯一能学会说话的动物，而鸟中具有最讨厌的声音的鹦鹉说的最好。我们不要说鹦鹉不懂它自己所说的是什么。……但在它的想像所达到的范围内，它也能学会懂得它所说的是什么。……”
