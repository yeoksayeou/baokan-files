The "Lowly" Are the Smartest
Shi Yongwei Yang Huiyi

	Bold Hypothesis

	In 1955, the workers of the Andong Machinery Factory were troubled by the factory's inability to keep up with demand. After Chairman Mao's report on "The Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was published, a vigorous cooperative movement was launched in the vast rural areas of the country. This pointed out a new direction for the Andong Machinery Factory, which was in difficulty – facing the countryside and serving agricultural production. To adapt to this new situation, the Andong Machinery Factory produced a large number of agricultural machines urgently needed for farming, irrigation, and transportation. Later, people further thought: Could farmers be able to jump from the backs of cattle to the backs of machines, so they don't need cattle to cultivate the land?

	The leaders and workers of the machinery factory all thought of tractors. However, they immediately realized, how could such a dilapidated factory manufacture tractors? This factory, which started from scratch, was initially just a small repair department of a gas factory. It found a dozen or so civilian houses in a small alley, tore down the old earthen beds, installed broken machines, and did some odd repair and parts-making work. By 1955, although production had greatly developed and the number of factory personnel had increased tenfold, the equipment was still pitifully simple: factory buildings built with reed mats and wooden boards, many workshops operating in the open air, three hundred or so people operating thirty or so old-fashioned belt-driven machine tools, without a single engineer, not even a formal technician. How could such a small factory with low technology and poor equipment dare to think of making tractors!

	To do it or not? At that time, there were fierce debates in the machinery factory from top to bottom, and in everyone's heart, the eagerness to try and the sense of inferiority were also fighting each other. They were excited by the high tide of agricultural cooperation throughout the country, encouraged by the prospect of agricultural mechanization, and forced by the factory's production situation at that time. Finally, they plucked up the courage to decide to try to manufacture tractors.

	Two Trials, Two Journeys

	The task of trial-manufacturing tractors was handed over to the new product trial-manufacturing team.

	In our country, there are such people: they have never seen a tractor (some have only seen it in a movie), relying on their own wisdom and hands, determined to make a tractor. What kind of people are these?

	Zhang Liancheng, the deputy director of the machinery factory, worked as a child laborer at the age of twelve and never attended school for a day. Thirty-eight years of hard work have honed him into a good craftsman. After joining the revolution, the revolutionary courage unique to veteran workers enabled him to start from scratch, manage diligently and frugally, and establish four factories in four years. The workers call him a "founder"; in his own words, he is a person who "dares to go to heaven if someone holds a ladder for me."

	Chang Fengyao, an eighth-grade worker with more than 30 years of service, only attended school for four years, and he can handle any fitter work. There was a broken rock drill that many factories in Andong City dared not repair. It was dragged to the machinery factory, and Master Chang repaired it. The workers say that he is a "native expert" in repairing broken machines, a "treasure trove" of wisdom. When they encounter difficulties in production, they are willing to consult with him. They said: "No matter what work we do, with Master Chang here, we have confidence in our hearts."

	Chen Tainian, this 26-year-old young man, just loves to study new things; he doesn't believe what others say is impossible. As a third-grade worker, he was originally unable to do some technically complex work, but he insisted on trying it. This kind of drive and studiousness is highly praised by the veteran masters, and he has become a capable assistant to the veteran masters. He was not originally in the trial-manufacturing team, but he repeatedly requested to participate in this creative work.

	There are also veteran workers Lin Huisheng, Yu Panhu, Yang Yangui, Liu Dexiu, and young worker Sun Yunfeng. Most of these people have only attended school for six years, and some have not even gone to school. In the old society, they were trampled under the feet of the "nobles," suffering humiliation, torture, and blows. After liberation, they became the masters of the factory, filled with beautiful ideals for socialist construction, and persevered and forged ahead in their work. It is these "lowly" people of the old era who are going to create miracles with their hardworking hands and infinite talents today!

	To manufacture tractors, there are no technical materials and no practical experience. Where to start? Zhang Liancheng, who directly led the tractor trial-manufacturing work, thought hard day and night, but could not find a clue. One day, the workers in the trial-manufacturing team found an old single-cylinder diesel engine in the scrap iron pile. The veteran workers suggested: Install four wheels on the diesel engine, first make it able to walk, and then further make it able to pull a plow, is that possible? However, no one knows how much traction power the single-cylinder diesel engine has. After discussing it for a long time, everyone believed that they should seize any opportunity and think of any method. If they think of it, they will do it, then see it, then change it, and never easily give up any way, and draw conclusions from practice. The trial-manufacturing began. The scrap iron pile became a "treasure trove," and several craftsmen made up Zhuge Liang. After several days of intense repair and modification, a tractor was pieced together. They placed the diesel engine on an old car frame, added gears and axles, and installed four car tires and a control lever. Once started, it could indeed walk.

	The people in the trial-manufacturing team successfully broke through the first difficulty, and then started the second trial-manufacturing. They also found the rear half of a single-cylinder horizontal tractor from the scrap iron pile. According to the structure of the rear half, they trial-manufactured the parts of the front half, intending to make a 20-horsepower diesel tractor. One day in May 1956, the workers drove this tractor to test it on the land near the factory. The traction power reached eight horsepower, and it could pull a double-wheel double-furrow plow. There were still many shortcomings, such as insensitive steering, large vibration, and low efficiency.

	The first trial proved that it could walk, and the second trial proved that it could pull a plow. This enhanced their confidence and drew the conclusion: they will definitely be able to make tractors. Before this, they were afraid of being laughed at, so they always said that they were trial-manufacturing "tractors." Now they openly announced: "We are going to trial-manufacture tractors!"

	In order to adapt to the factory's technical and equipment conditions and trial-manufacture a tractor with simple structure and low cost, they looked for drawings and data everywhere. They saw a tractor on the Liberation Army Pictorial of the China-Hungary Friendship Farm in Shandong Province that was exactly what they imagined. Zhang Liancheng immediately sent someone to survey and map it. Unfortunately, they were busy with farming and the machine could not be disassembled for them to survey and map. They also found out that the Beizhen County Tractor Station in Liaoning Province also had this Hungarian tractor. Zhang Liancheng immediately led veteran workers Chang Fengyao, Yang Yangui, and trainee technician Yue Dekun to Beizhen. When the comrades at the tractor station heard that they wanted to trial-manufacture tractors, they were very happy and allocated a tractor for them to survey and map. They set up a tent in the field, put a wooden board on the carrying basket as a drawing board, and used wooden blocks as chairs. They did not have surveying and mapping tools, so they used thread to measure. They worked hard day and night for three months and surveyed and mapped all more than 1,000 parts.

	Two trials, two journeys, finally found the direction and obtained the blueprint. The tractor trial-manufacturing work has taken a big step forward.

	Native Methods Show Great Power

	According to the conventional method, to trial-manufacture tractor parts, there must be at least grinders, boring machines, electric furnaces, and various instruments. However, the trial-manufacturing team of this factory only had two lathes, one grinder, and one shaper, and they were all old-fashioned belt-driven lathes. When they were turned on, they shook and swayed like someone having malaria. The accuracy was so poor that if they wanted to turn a round part, it often turned into a duck egg shape. These equipments can at most do some small repairs and parts matching, but now they are used to make tractors.

	A few people, when they heard that they were going to trial-manufacture tractors, did not warmly welcome them, but poured cold water on them, thinking that this was divorced from reality, "wanting to run before learning to crawl," saying that Zhang Liancheng was "daydreaming." Some people want to find ready-made "basis" for everything, only believe in existing things, do not admit new things, only believe in "foreign" things, and do not believe in "native" things. They are very inferior and think: "Our factory can't make tractors at all."

	Under such circumstances, the people in the trial-manufacturing team had to resist the attacks of the cold wind and the reverse current on the one hand, and fight against the heavy difficulties on the other.

	The transmission gear is an important part of the tractor. It must be soft inside and hard outside, both wear-resistant and not brittle, which requires heat treatment with an electric furnace. But they didn't even know what kind of steel the transmission gear was made of. Zhang Liancheng believed that the function of the transmission gear was similar to that of the car gear, so he found an old car gear from the scrap iron pile, smashed it open for research, and imitated it to make a transmission gear. Without an electric furnace, they came up with a native method: heating the transmission gear in a crucible for melting copper. During the heating process, it would not work if the time was too long or too short; it would not work if the fire was too light or too heavy. This requires instruments to master the carburizing degree. They couldn't be stumped by not having instruments. The trial-manufacturing team found several iron rods as test rods and carburized them together with the gears. They took out an iron rod every certain period of time and broke it to observe the degree of carburization. In this way, they finally made a transmission gear that met the technical requirements.

	They were in trouble when making the fuel injection nozzle of the fuel pump. The fuel injection nozzle is very small, only two or three hairs thick. It is a very precise job and must be drilled with electric spark equipment. They couldn't buy or borrow this thing, and everyone was anxious. Xiao Chen ran to ask Master Chang: "How did you drill the oil nozzle in the Navigation Bureau?" This reminded Master Chang. He and everyone broke the waste saw blade into two, grinded it into a steel needle as thin as a steel needle, and used it as a drill bit. The drilled oil nozzle not only met the specifications, but also had no oil dripping problem.

	Making a fuel pump is a very precise job and must be ground with a grinder. They only had a broken lathe. Lin Huisheng spent a lot of effort to make seven or eight fuel pumps with it, but they were all scrapped. Xiao Chen ran to the nail and needle factory and the Yalu River Paper Mill to find a grinder. He searched for a whole day but couldn't find it. Later, Lin Huisheng came up with an idea: "Take down the small electric roller on the hair dryer, install a small grinding wheel, and put it on the lathe as a grinder, what do you think?" Xiao Chen was happy when he heard it: "This is really a good idea! Director Zhang is right: We are not afraid of difficult things, but we are afraid of not being dedicated!" The two of them followed this method, and the fuel pump they ground out was of very good quality.

	During the trial-manufacturing process, some people were doing it on the one hand, and questioning in their hearts on the other: "Is this okay? Is there any theoretical basis?" Director Zhang answered well: "Other countries can make tractors, can't we make them? I don't believe it! If we can't find the basis in books, then we have succeeded, that is the basis!" Those veteran craftsmen are even more unwilling to give in. It is difficult to hear words like "cannot" and "impossible" from their mouths. They always say "Okay!" "Can do!" "Let's try!" In the middle of the trial-manufacturing, they used domestic ordinary steel to replace the imported nickel-chromium steel; they made their own tools when they couldn't buy them; a kind of gear could not be processed by machine tools, so they had to pick it out manually; they used their eyes to see and listen to the sound to make judgments because they didn't have scientific instruments for testing and measuring... In short, they used all their eighteen kinds of martial arts. Difficulties made them smarter, and the more difficulties they encountered, the more ingenious the solutions they came up with.

	After the parts were made, the difficulties of assembly and starting were in front of them again. In February 1957, after the tractor was assembled, the people in the trial-manufacturing team worked continuously for three days and three nights, but the machine still did not start. They couldn't eat or sleep, squatted beside the machine thinking and worrying, their faces were haggard, and their eyes were full of bloodshot eyes. Even on New Year's Eve, they stayed by the machine. The Party branch secretary and the factory director drove them home several times, but they quietly ran back by appointment, and kept working until the first day of the New Year.

	Under the care and support of the Party and higher-level leading organs, in the face of the workers' iron-like determination, one technical secret after another was revealed, and one difficulty after another was conquered; and every time they overcame a difficulty, it in turn increased their confidence and courage, broke superstitions, shook off inferiority, resisted the cold wind, and resisted the reverse current. The tractor was successfully trial-manufactured!

	Highest Reward

	In February 1957, "Yalu River No. 1" was born!

	Unexpectedly, the fate of this tractor was so unfortunate! As soon as it was born, it encountered a cold wind of "anti-adventurism." The higher-level administrative department did not recognize it and did not approve it for production; the tractor was sent to the "cold palace" and locked in the warehouse, not seeing the light of day for more than a year.

	Newborn things cannot be confined and are irresistible! Our Party cleared obstacles for it and opened up roads. In the spring of 1958, like all parts of the country, a surging great leap forward wave was set off in this heroic city on the border of the motherland, mercilessly swept away all cold wind and evil spirits, and opened the door to close new things. "Yalu River No. 1" came to the fore!

	This year's "May Day" Labor Day, "Yalu River No. 1" was dressed in green costumes, from Andong to Beijing, driven by its heroic owner, proudly passed through Tiananmen Square, and accepted the review of the central leaders. The workers of Andong Machinery Factory manufactured tractors and won the highest reward. (Attached pictures)

    “卑贱者”最聪明
    石永伟　杨会义
              大胆的设想
    1955年，安东机械厂的职工曾经为工厂吃不饱而苦恼过。毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”的报告发表以后，全国广大农村掀起了轰轰烈烈的合作化运动，这给在困难中的安东机械厂指出了新的发展方向——面向农村，为农业生产服务。适应这种新的形势，安东机械厂为农村生产了大批耕种、排灌、运输等急需的农业机械。后来，人们又进一步想到：能不能让农民从牛背上跨到机器背上，耕地不用牛？
    机械厂的领导和工人都不约而同地想到了拖拉机。可是，又立刻意识到，像这样一个破烂厂子，怎么能够制造拖拉机？这个白手起家的工厂，起初只是瓦斯工厂的一个小修理部，在一条小胡同里找了十来间民房，扒了老土炕，安上破机器，做些零修零配的杂活；到1955年，虽然生产有了很大的发展，工厂的人员增加了十倍，但是设备仍然简陋得可怜：苇席和木板搭的厂房，许多车间在露天作业，三百来人操纵着三十多台老掉牙的皮带机床，没有一个工程师，连个正式技术员也没有。就这样一个技术低、设备差的小工厂，怎么敢想造出拖拉机！
    干，还是不干？当时机械厂不仅从上到下都有激烈的争论，而且在每个人的内心，跃跃欲试的劲头跟自卑感也在作斗争。他们被全国农业合作化的高潮激动着，被农业机械化的前景鼓舞着，被当时工厂的生产情况逼迫着，终于壮着胆子决定试制拖拉机。
        两次试制，两次奔波
    试制拖拉机的任务，交给了新产品试制小组。
    在我们国家里，有这样的人：他们从来没有见过拖拉机（有的只是在电影上看过一眼），凭着自己的智慧和双手，决心造出拖拉机来。这究竟是些什么样的人呢？
    张连城，机械厂的副厂长，十二岁当童工，一天书也没念过，三十八年的辛勤劳动，磨练出一副好手艺。参加革命后，老工人特具的革命胆略，使他在四年间，白手起家，勤俭经营，办起了四座工厂。工人称他是“创家立业”的能手；用他自己的话来说，他是个“有人搬梯子，我就敢上天”的人。
    常逢尧，三十多年工龄的八级工，只念了四年书，对于钳工活，件件拿得起、放得下。有台破开山机，安东市好多工厂不敢修理，拖到机械厂，常师傅把它修理好了。工人说他是修理破烂机器的“土专家”，是智慧的“万宝囊”，在生产上遇到困难，都愿意跟他商量。他们说：“不论干什么活，有常师傅在，我们心里就有底。”
    陈太年，这个二十六岁的小伙子，就爱钻研个新东西；人家说不行，他偏不信邪。作为三级工，有些技术复杂的活，本来做不了，他硬要试一试。这种干劲和钻劲，很得老师傅们的称赞，他成了老师傅们的得力助手。试制组原来没有他，他几次三番地要求参加了这一创造性的劳动。
    还有老工人林辉生、于畔湖、杨延贵、刘德修，青年工人孙云峰。这些人，最多的只念过六年书，有的还没有上过学。在旧社会，被“高贵者”踩在脚底下，受凌辱、折磨和打击。解放了，他们成了工厂的主人，对社会主义建设事业充满了美好的理想，在劳动中，坚韧不拔，勇往直前。就是这些旧时代的“卑贱者”，今天要用勤劳的双手和无穷的才智，创造奇迹！
    制造拖拉机，一没有技术资料，二没有实际经验，从哪儿下手？直接领导拖拉机试制工作的张连城，昼夜苦思，也没有个头绪。一天，试制组的工人从废铁堆里发现了一台破旧的单缸柴油机。老工人提出：把柴油机安上四个轱辘，先叫它能走，再进一步叫它能拉犁，行不行？然而单缸柴油机的牵引能力怎么样，谁也没有数。核计了半天，大家认为，应该有门就钻，是法就想，想到就做，做了再看，看了再改，绝不轻易放弃任何一个门路，从实践中作出结论。试制开始了。废铁堆变成了“万宝囊”，几个工匠凑成了诸葛亮。经过几天紧张的修理和改装，一台牵引机拼凑起来了。他们把柴油机安置在一个旧车架上，添上齿轮和轴杠，安上四个汽车轮胎和操纵杆。一发动，果然能走了。
    试制组的人们成功地突破了第一道难关，接着开始了第二次试制。他们又从废铁堆里，找到一台单缸卧式牵引机的后半部分，根据后半部分的结构，试制了前半部分的部件，打算制成一台二十马力的柴油牵引机。1956年5月的一天，工人驾驶这台牵引机，在工厂附近的土地上作了试验，牵引能力达到八马力，能拉动一台双轮双铧犁。缺点还很多，转动不灵敏，震动很大，效率不高。
    第一次试制证明能走动，第二次试制证明能拉犁。这就给他们增强了信心，得出了结论：一定能够造出拖拉机。在这以前，他们怕人家笑话，总是说在试制“牵引车”，现在他们公开宣布：“我们要试制拖拉机！”
    为了适应本厂的技术和设备条件，试制一种构造简单、成本低廉的拖拉机，他们到处找图样，查资料。在解放军画报上看到山东省的中匈友谊农场有一台正合他们想像的拖拉机，张连城马上派人前去测绘。不巧，人家正在农忙，机器不能拆卸供他们测绘。他们又打听到辽宁省北镇县拖拉机站也有这种匈牙利的拖拉机，张连城立刻带领老工人常逢尧、杨延贵和见习技术员岳德坤赶到北镇。拖拉机站的同志们听说他们要试制拖拉机，很高兴，拨出一台拖拉机专供他们测绘。他们在野地里搭起帐篷，抬筐上放一块木板当绘图板，木头墩子当椅子，没有测绘工具就用线来测量。他们不分昼夜，苦战了三个月，把一千多件部件全部测绘下来。
    两次试制，两次奔波，终于找到了方向，获得了蓝本。拖拉机试制工作向前迈进了一大步。
          土办法大显神通
    按照常规，试制拖拉机部件，起码必须有磨床、镗床、电炉以及各种仪器。这个厂的试制组却只有两台车床、一台研床、一台牛头刨，而且都是陈旧的皮带车床，开动起来，像发疟子似地颠动摇摆。精密度竟差到这种程度：本来要车个圆形部件，往往车成了鸭蛋形。这些设备，充其量只能干些零修碎配的小活，现在他们却用来造拖拉机了。
    有少数人，听说他们要试制拖拉机，不是热情欢迎，而是吹冷风、泼冷水，认为这是脱离实际，“不会爬，就想跑”，说张连城“空想”。有的人是什么事情都要找现成的“根据”，只相信已有的事物，不承认新生的事物，只相信“洋”的，不相信“土”的。他们非常自卑地认为：“咱们厂根本不可能造出拖拉机。”
    在这样情况下，试制组的人们不得不一面抵制着冷风逆流的袭击，一面跟重重的困难作斗争。
    变速齿轮，是拖拉机上的一个重要部件，必须里软外硬，既抗磨，又不脆裂，这就需要用电炉来进行热处理。但是他们连变速齿轮是什么成份的钢做的，都不知道。张连城认为变速齿轮跟汽车牙轮的功能差不多，便从破铁堆里找了个旧汽车牙轮，砸开来研究，照葫芦画瓢，做了个变速齿轮。没有电炉，他们想出了土办法，把变速齿轮放在化铜的坩锅加热。加热过程中，时间长了不行，短了也不行；火轻了不行，重了也不行。这就需要用仪器来掌握渗炭程度。没有仪器也难不住他们，试制组找了几根铁棍作试验棒，跟齿轮放在一起渗炭，每隔一定时间拿出一根铁棍把它裂断，观察渗炭的程度。这样，他们终于做出了合乎技术要求的变速齿轮。
    做燃油泵的喷油咀时，他们犯了难。喷油咀很细小，只有两、三根头发那么粗，是个非常精密的活，非用电火花设备钻孔不可。这东西买不着、借不到，大家急得直打转转。小陈跑去问常师傅：“你当初在航务局，油咀是怎么钻的？”这下提醒了常师傅，他跟大伙儿一起，把废锯条一破两开，磨成钢针一般细，当钻头用。钻出来的油咀，不但合乎规格，而且没有滴油的毛病。
    做燃油泵，是个非常精密的活，必须用磨床磨。他们只有台破车床，林辉生用它费很大劲，做了七、八个燃油泵，都废了。小陈跑到制钉制针厂、鸭绿江造纸厂找磨床，足足找了一天也没找到。后来林辉生想出了个办法：“把吹风机上的小电滚拿下来，安上个小砂轮，架在车床上当磨床用，你看行不？”小陈一听，乐了：“这真是个好办法！张厂长说的对：不怕有难事，只怕心不专！”两个人照这个办法去做，磨出来的燃油泵，质量很好。
    试制过程中，有的人一面干着，一面心里打问号：“这样干行么？有理论根据么？”张厂长回答得好：“别的国家能造出拖拉机，咱们造不出来？我就不相信！从书本上找不到根据，咱们搞成了，就是根据！”那些老工匠，更不信邪，从他们嘴里很难听到“不能”、“不行”这样的字眼，总是说“行！”“能干！”“试试看！”试制中间，需要进口的镍铬钢，他们用国产的普通钢代替；买不到刀具，自己动手做；有一种齿轮无法用机床加工，硬是用手工剔了出来；没有化验、测量用的科学仪器，就用肉眼看、敲声听来作判断……。总之，他们的十八般武艺全使出来了。困难使他们变得更聪明，困难越多，他们想出的办法越巧妙。
    部件做出来了，装配、发动的困难又摆在面前。1957年2月，拖拉机装配起来以后，试制组的人连续干了三天三夜，机器仍没有发动起来。他们吃不下饭，睡不着觉，蹲在机器旁琢磨着、焦虑着，面孔消瘦了，眼睛里充满了血丝，直到大年三十晚上，还守在机器旁。党支部书记、厂长几次把他们撵回家去，他们又悄悄地不约而同地跑回来，一直干到大年初一。
    在党、上级领导机关的关怀和支持下，在工人们钢铁般的决心面前，一个一个的技术秘密被揭穿了，一个一个的困难被征服了；而每战胜一个困难，反过来更增加了他们的信心和胆量，破除了迷信，甩掉了自卑感，顶住了冷风，抗住了逆流。拖拉机试制成功了！
            最高的奖赏
    1957年2月，“鸭绿江一号”诞生了！
    没想到，这台拖拉机的命运竟这样不幸！刚一出生，又碰上一股“反冒进”的冷风。上级行政管理部门没有承认它，没有批准他们投入生产；拖拉机被打入“冷宫”，关在仓库里，一年多没见天日。
  新生事物是关不住的，是不可抗拒的！我们的党为它扫清了障碍，开辟了道路。1958年春天，像全国各地一样，在这座祖国边疆的英雄城市，掀起了澎湃的大跃进的巨浪，无情地卷走了一切冷风邪气，冲开了关闭新事物的大门，“鸭绿江一号”出头露面了！
    今年“五一”劳动节，“鸭绿江一号”披上了绿色的盛装，由安东到北京，由它英雄的主人驾驶着，骄傲地驶过了天安门，接受了中央领导同志的检阅。安东机械厂职工制造拖拉机，获得了最高的奖赏。（附图片）
