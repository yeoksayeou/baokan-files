Intercropping Trees and Grain Can Accelerate Chinese Fir Growth
Xiao Ming

Chinese fir is a remarkably good building material. It grows tall and round, straight from top to bottom, with a strong yet lightweight texture, and excellent resistance to decay and insects. Even termites, those notorious wood-destroying enemies, are helpless against Chinese fir. The Chinese fir produced in the Qingshui River basin of Guizhou Province is particularly tall and highly resistant to decay, making it the renowned Miao Mountains fir on the timber market.

In the past, the fastest maturation period for Chinese fir was eighteen years, with a common period of about thirty years, and some taking as long as sixty years. In timber jargon, "eighteen fir," "thirty fir," and "sixty fir" are distinguished by their growth years. Sixty fir often grow naturally in high mountains and deep valleys. Eighteen fir must be artificially nurtured to promote their growth. And intercropping trees and grain is precisely a good method for promoting the growth of Chinese fir. According to a survey in Sanjiang Township, Jinping County, simultaneously planted Chinese fir that were intercropped have grown to three feet tall, while those planted in pits are less than one foot tall. Recently, Jinping County discovered many "ten fir," "thirteen fir," and "fifteen fir" that surpassed "eighteen fir" in one hundred and thirty agricultural cooperatives. And these "ten fir," "thirteen fir," etc., all grow on land where trees and grain are intercropped.

Currently, Jinping County is launching a mass movement to break the superstition of "eighteen fir" and transform "eighteen fir" into "ten fir" and "eleven fir" to supply the country with more construction timber.

About two hundred years ago, the Miao people in Jianhe, Taijiang, and surrounding areas began intercropping trees and grain. The intercropping method involves sowing corn, beans, or potato crops in the gaps between saplings after land preparation and seedling planting. Later, it developed into planting economic trees such as tung trees and oil-tea camellias in the gaps between Chinese fir trees. Under normal circumstances, grain crops can be harvested for three years. In the fourth year, tung trees or oil-tea camellias begin to produce tung seeds or oil-tea seeds, which can be harvested for about five or six years. By this time, the Chinese fir trees have grown tall, and the tung tea trees are abandoned, with the fir trees forming a forest by the eighteenth year. Some areas are now researching the planting of shade-tolerant crops after the income from tung seeds and oil-tea seeds ceases, so that the land can generate income every year.

This intercropping of trees and grain has three benefits: First, young forest tending is combined with the middle-tillage and weeding of grain crops, saving labor; second, applying fertilizer to grain crops is beneficial to forest trees, promoting rapid tree growth; and third, it gives full play to land potential and combines the long-term interests of farmers with their current interests, both aiding the growth of trees and generating income from grain.

If all Chinese fir-producing areas in our country could shorten the maturation period of Chinese fir to within ten years, then the supply of timber in our country would certainly undergo a great change in the short term. This valuable experience of the Miao and Dong people is being vigorously promoted in Guizhou Province this year, with about ten million mu of land currently used for intercropping trees and grain throughout the province. This summer, Tongren Prefecture plans to reclaim three million mu of wild forests and intercrop them with potato and manure crops, which will not only increase grain income but also promote the growth of wild forests.

    林粮混作能加速杉木成长

    杉木是相当好的建筑用材。它身高、体圆、上下通直，材质坚固而量轻，防腐防虫性能很强，连侵犯木材的恶敌白蚁在杉木面前也无能为力。贵州省清水江流域所产杉木，身更高，耐腐性更强，成为木材市场上著有盛名的苗岭杉。
    过去杉木最快的成材期是十八年，一般的是三十年左右，慢的也有六十年的。在木材行话里称十八杉、三十杉、六十杉就是以生长多少年区分的。六十杉多是在高山深谷中自生自长的。十八杉必须有人工抚育，促进其生长才行。而林粮混作正是促进杉木成长的一种好方法。据锦屏县三江镇调查，同时栽的杉木，混作地上栽的已长到三尺高，挖坑栽的还不足一尺。锦屏县最近在一百三十个农业社里，发现了许多盖过十八杉的十杉、十三杉、十五杉等。而这些十杉、十三杉等又都是生长在林粮混作土地上。
    目前锦屏县正掀起群众性的破除十八杉的迷信，变十八杉为十杉、十一杉的运动，给国家供应更多的建筑木材。
    约在二百年前，剑河、台江一带苗族人民就开始了林粮混作。混作的方法是在整地栽苗以后，在树苗的空隙中播种玉米、豆类或薯类作物。以后又发展成在杉木空隙中栽种油桐油茶等经济林木。根据一般情况，粮食作物可收三年；到第四年，油桐或油茶开始收桐子或油茶籽，约可收五、六年，这时杉木已挺身高耸，即废弃桐茶树，到第十八年杉树成林。现在有些地区正研究在桐茶籽收入停止后，种植耐阴作物，使土地年年有收益。
    这种林粮混作的好处有三：一、幼林抚育与粮食中耕锄草相结合，节省劳动力；二、给粮食作物施肥对林木有好处，能促进林木迅速成长；三、充分发挥土地潜力，并使农民的长远利益与目前利益相结合，既助长了林木，又收入了粮食。
    如果我国所有产杉木地区，都能把杉木成材期缩短到十年以内，那么我国用材木的供应情况，一定能在短期内起很大变化。苗族和侗族人民的这项宝贵经验，今年在贵州省得到大力推广，全省目前约有一千万亩林粮混作地。铜仁专区今夏准备垦复三百万亩野生林，混种薯粪作物，既能增加粮食收入，又能促进野生林的成长。
