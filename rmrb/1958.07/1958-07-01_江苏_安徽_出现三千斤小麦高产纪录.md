    Report High Wheat Yield Records of Three Thousand Jin
    (Our Dispatch) Jiangsu Province has also reported a high wheat yield record of 3,263 jin and 7 liang per mu. This was achieved in an experimental plot cultivated by cadres of the Xicheng Agricultural Cooperative in Jurong County.
    On June 25th, an inspection team composed of the Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture, wheat experts from the East China Agricultural Science Institute, and responsible persons from the Jurong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party measured the land and verified the yield at the Xicheng Cooperative, and then held a bumper harvest symposium.
    This experimental plot is a double-cropping rice-wheat field in a hilly area, covering an area of 1.56 mu. It yielded a total of 5,091 jin of wheat. It was an experimental plot of four people: the cooperative director Kong Qingrui, deputy director Liu Zhenggang, cooperative accountant Gu Cairen, and the 21st production team leader Gu Zhengrong. When making the plan last autumn, the target yield was 900 jin per mu. The local wheat yield is usually only about 110 jin per mu. Some people said: These people are really bold as tigers, how did they think of that? The cooperative director and Communist Party member, Kong Qingrui, said well: To have a Great Leap Forward, one must have the boldness of a tiger, but in doing it, one must have the carefulness of a maiden. Regardless of others' opinions, they meticulously arranged measures to increase production and led the cooperative members to work hard throughout the winter and spring in a down-to-earth manner.
    Kong Xianming, a 57-year-old cooperative member, once said, "Thinking of 900 jin is dreaming." He is a member of the threshing ground management group. When the wheat from the experimental plot was harvested and threshed separately, he participated in winnowing the wheat, weighing it, and was responsible for stacking the wheat. He said excitedly at the symposium: Things that I never dreamed of in the past have been achieved today. I can no longer have such an old-fashioned view.
    Six female cooperative members harvested this mu of land from 4:00 in the morning until 4:00 in the afternoon, and then added seven more people, and it was only finished at 6:00.
    This experimental plot was plowed three times to a depth of six inches, and 490 dan of base fertilizer was applied in layers. The early-maturing and high-yielding local variety "Huoshaotian" was selected, with a seed amount of 30 jin net weight. Topdressing was applied four times later, with 55 dan of night soil, 170 dan of river silt, and 15 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu. Weeding, ditching for drainage, and chemical pest control were also done early and well. As a result, there were 1.58 million ears per mu. The ears were numerous, uniform, and large. The stalks were thick and strong, with large ears having more than 70 grains, and an average of 43.9 grains per ear.
    Wheat experts helped the 21st team summarize the experience of high yield. They believed that because the plowing was not deep enough, the fertilizer was not sufficient enough, the phosphorus and potassium fertilizer was still too little, and there was a slight stem rust disease, the grains were not full enough; if measures were further strengthened in deep plowing, fertilization, and disease prevention and control, the yield could be greatly increased.
    (Our Dispatch) Feidong County, Anhui Province, is a hilly area, with rice as the main crop. In the past, wheat yields were not high. Last year, wheat generally had a good harvest, with an average yield of only 120 jin per mu, and the highest in the county reached 500 jin per mu.
    This year, the Xiao Luo Production Team of the Tonghe Cooperative in Shichang Township, harvested 3,648 jin of "Ersi Yi Jiu" wheat per mu, resulting in a yield of 3,040 jin per mu.
    This high-yield wheat field was jointly cultivated by Luo Guojian, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the Tonghe Cooperative, Luo Shengjin, a member of the branch committee, Sang Chaoqing, a member of the cooperative management committee, and Luo Guozhi, the production team leader. The soil is the local better oil-white soil, and the previous crop was early and mid-season rice.

### 江苏·安徽  出现三千斤小麦高产纪录

    江苏·安徽
    出现三千斤小麦高产纪录
    本报讯　江苏省也出现了小麦亩产三千二百六十三斤零七两的高产纪录。这是句容县西城农业社干部试验田培育成功的。
    6月25日，江苏省农业厅副厅长、华东农业科学研究所的小麦专家和中共句容县委负责人组成的考察组，在西城社丈量土地、核实产量后，举行了丰产座谈会。
    这块试验田是丘陵地区的稻麦两熟田，面积一点五六亩，共收麦子五千零九十一斤，是社主任孔庆瑞、副主任刘正刚、社会计顾才仁、二十一生产队队长顾正荣等四个人的试验田。去秋做规划时，亩产订的九百斤。当地的小麦亩产通常是百十斤。有人说：这些人真是老虎胆，怎么想得出的？社主任、共产党员孔庆瑞说得好：要大跃进就要有老虎的胆，但做起来又要有姑娘的心。他们不管别人的议论，细致地安排了增产措施，扎扎实实地领着社员们苦干了一个冬春。
    五十七岁的社员孔宪明当时就曾说过“想九百斤是在做梦”的话。他是场头保管组员。试验田的麦子单收单打时，他参加扬麦、过秤、负责堆麦。他兴奋地在座谈会上说：过去做梦也想不到的事今天做到了，这下不能再老眼光了。
    这一亩多田，六个女社员从早上四点钟开始，割到下午四点，又增加了七个人，割到六点才割完。
    这块试验田耕了三遍，深六寸，分层施基肥四百九十担。选用早熟丰产的地方良种“火烧天”，用种量净重三十斤。后期追肥四次，每亩用水粪五十五担，河泥一百七十担，化肥十五斤。锄草、开沟排水、药剂治虫等也都做得早、做得好。结果每亩有一百五十八万穗，穗多、穗齐、穗大，秆子粗壮，大穗有七十多粒，平均每穗四十三点九粒。
    小麦专家们帮助二十一队总结了丰产经验。他们认为由于耕得还不够深，肥料还不够足，磷钾肥还嫌少，还有轻微的秆锈病，因此子粒还不够饱满；如果在深耕、施肥、防治病害等方面措施再加码，产量还可大大提高。
    本报讯　安徽肥东县是丘陵地区，农作物以水稻为主，历年来小麦产量不高，去年小麦一般是丰收年，每亩平均也只收一百二十斤，全县最高的一亩达到五百斤。
    今年石塘乡同合社小罗生产队，一丘田一亩二分南大“二四一九”小麦，实收三千六百四十八斤亩产三千零四十斤。
    这块高产小麦田，是同合社共青团支部书记罗国建，支部委员罗胜瑾，社管委会委员桑朝清，生产队长罗国志共同培植的。土质是当地较好的油白土，前茬是早中稻田。
