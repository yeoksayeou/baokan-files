Driving Steel Dragon Straight to Yinchuan
Zhu Zhensheng

    The summer in the desert is scorching, the sun baking down relentlessly. Every grain of sand feels like it's just been tossed from a hot wok. Steel rails on the sleepers are so hot that the asphalt drips from the sleepers, filling the construction site with a burnt smell. The heat, however, could not defeat the blazing enthusiasm in the chests of the railway soldiers. The dream of laying the track to Yinchuan ahead of schedule inspired the soldiers to overcome all kinds of difficulties.

    Steel arms, one after another, hoisted gleaming steel rails, pushing directly towards Yinchuan; the mighty locomotive, following the soldiers' footsteps, sounded its soaring whistle, advancing towards Yinchuan! The soldiers' slogan was: "Work hard in heavy rain, work harder in light rain, and work like mad when there's no wind or rain!"

    In the battle to seize time, the assault team led by squad leader Zhang Xiangyu created a record of each person carrying sixty sleepers a day and walking one hundred and twenty *li*. The time to load steel rails was shortened from five minutes to fifty seconds; the rail-fastening team laid a set of steel rails in two minutes and thirty seconds; the spike-driving soldiers hammered a set of spikes in three to five blows; the locomotive drivers also shortened a cycle from twenty-eight minutes to sixteen minutes. Here, the steel rails progressed one thousand meters per hour. Xu Heng, the political commissar of the track-laying team, said: "You can hardly tell who is superior to whom on the construction site. Our unit is composed of collective heroes!"

    The track-laying train, crossing the desert and entering the plains, suddenly received important news: the comrades of the track-laying team of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who were constructing the southern section, were going to seize the red flag and strive to lay the track to Yinchuan ahead of schedule! A sense of honor was inspiring everyone, and the soldiers cheered: "We must not lose the glorious title of 'Assault Team Members' on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway!" "We want to seize the red flag of being the first to enter Yinchuan!" Following this, the track-laying record was raised from five kilometers per day to six point eight kilometers, seven point three kilometers… On July 17th, an astonishing record appeared. The heroic track-laying soldiers created a national record of laying ten point four five five seven kilometers of track manually in one day!

    The whistle sounded, approaching Yinchuan. The battle continued from day to night. The two headlights in front of the track-laying train were like two sharp swords, cutting through the night sky. Long lanterns illuminated several *li* of roadbed as if it were daytime. The sound of hammers, the clanging of steel rails, and the shouts of labor shocked the nearby quiet villages, and men, women, and children came in groups to watch. In the cool night breeze, a several-kilometer-long band of light flickered and jumped.

    The soldiers greeted the victorious dawn with battle. After many hard days and nights, the track-laying soldiers of the Railway Corps finally drove the Steel Dragon and were the first to enter Yinchuan, seizing the red flag.

    On July 25th, people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia welcomed their own soldiers and the first train to victoriously enter Yinchuan with the following couplet:

    Splitting high mountains and filling seas, they also lead the long rainbow across the Yellow River;
    Crossing deserts and traversing grasslands, they drive the steel dragon straight into Yinchuan!

    驾驭钢龙直驱银川
    朱振声
    沙漠上的酷夏，阳光炙人。每颗沙粒都像刚从热锅里炒出来的。钢轨放在枕木上，烫得枕木上的沥青滴滴淌油，工地上笼罩着一层焦糊气味。炎热，战不败铁道兵战士们胸膛里的旺盛火焰，提前铺轨到银川的理想，鼓舞着战士们去冲破各种困难。
    一双双钢铁臂膀，抱起亮闪闪的钢轨，直逼银川；雄伟的火车头，跟随着战士们的脚步，鸣着高昂的汽笛，向银川挺进！战士们的口号是：“大雨小干，小雨大干，无风无雨猛干！”
    在争夺时间的战斗里，下士班长张香裕领导的突击队，创造了每人每天扛运枕木六十根、奔走一百二十里的纪录。装运钢轨，由五分钟缩短到五十秒钟；扣轨队两分三十秒便铺下一组钢轨；钉道战士三、五锤便钉好了一组道钉；机车司机，也由一个循环二十八分缩短到十六分钟，这里，钢轨每小时进展一千公尺。铺轨队政委徐恒说：“你在工地上很难分辨出谁高谁低，我们的部队，是集体英雄所组成！”
    铺轨列车，穿过沙漠，跨入平原地区，这时，突然传来了一个重要消息：在南段施工的铁道部第一工程局铺轨队的同志，要夺取红旗，争取提前铺轨到银川！战士的荣誉感，在激励着每一个人，战士们振臂高呼：“决不能在包兰线上，丢掉‘突击队员’的光荣称号！”“我们要夺取首进银川的红旗！”跟着，铺轨的纪录由日进五公里提高到六点八公里、七点三公里……7月17日，一个惊人的纪录出现了。英勇的铺轨战士，创造了日进十点四五五七公里的人工铺轨全国最高纪录！
    汽笛一声声逼进银川，战斗从白天延续到夜晚。铺轨列车前面的两轮照明灯，像两把利剑，划破夜空。长长的灯笼，把几里长的路基照耀得如同白昼。铁锤声，钢轨撞击声，劳动的吆喝声，震惊了附近宁静的村庄，男女老少成群结伙地赶来观光。在清凉的夜风中，一条几公里长的光带，闪闪跃动。
    战士们用战斗迎接了胜利的黎明。经过许多个艰苦的日日夜夜，铁道兵铺轨队战士，终于驾驭着钢龙，首先进入了银川，夺取了红旗。
    7月25日，宁夏各族人民，用这样的对联来欢迎自己的子弟兵，欢迎胜利驶入银川的第一列火车：
    劈高山，填海洋，又引长虹跨黄河；
    越沙漠，过草原，直驱钢龙进银川！（附图片）
