    (By Our Correspondent) In order to better serve the promotion of industrial and agricultural production and facilitate the buying and selling of goods for the masses, all parts of the country are paying attention to the reform of the rural commercial network. Judging from the situation of full or partial commercial network reforms in seventeen provinces and cities, the number of rural purchasing and marketing points after the reform has increased by 50% to more than doubled compared to the original number. This can basically achieve "a store in every township, a point (or supply and marketing department) in every cooperative, and buying and selling in every village," so that farmers can buy and sell general daily necessities without leaving their villages. According to typical surveys in some areas, each household can save about ten working days per year because farmers can buy daily necessities and sell small amounts of local products and waste products nearby.

    What problems existed in the original rural commercial network? On the one hand, most of the stores were concentrated in market towns, and there were too few purchasing and marketing points in the countryside, resulting in bloated institutions and overstaffing in the market towns, and inconvenience for rural residents to buy and sell things. On the other hand, the distribution of the rural commercial network was not sufficiently integrated with the collectivized production units of agriculture, and commercial work and agricultural production activities were often not in sync, especially since the great leap forward in production in rural areas, labor has been very intensive. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the reform of the rural commercial network.

    In the work of reforming the rural commercial network, all localities have generally implemented the requirements of better serving production, facilitating large-scale purchases and sales, and facilitating the unified leadership of the grassroots party. In terms of approach, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, unified planning is carried out, attention is paid to cooperation in all aspects, the masses are fully relied upon, and the strength of the state is combined with the strength of the masses. The focus of the reform is roughly divided into three aspects: In the plains areas, purchasing and marketing points are extended to agricultural cooperatives, so that the commercial network is further closer to the production units, basically achieving "a store in every township, a point in every cooperative, and buying and selling in every village"; in mountainous and remote areas, purchasing and marketing points and mobile purchasing and marketing organizations are vigorously developed, and purchasing and processing networks are generally established and strengthened to implement local procurement and local processing, and vigorously utilize mountainous resources; the commercial network and commercial personnel in market towns, in addition to mobilizing some to go to the countryside for purchasing and marketing and participating in production, the stores and personnel remaining in the market towns have generally been appropriately adjusted, paying attention to the role of market towns as a certain economic center in the countryside.

    In the reform of the rural commercial network, due to different specific conditions in various places, the forms adopted are also diverse: some agricultural cooperatives have established supply and marketing departments; some have organized peddlers to establish service stores in agricultural cooperatives; some have state-owned stores extending distribution stores; and some have set up purchasing and marketing agents in agricultural cooperatives. Among them, the establishment of supply and marketing departments by agricultural cooperatives is a new form of commercial organization. At present, there are already seventeen provinces and cities conducting pilot projects or comprehensively promoting it, and have gained a lot of experience in the experiment and promotion.

    After the reform, the rural commercial network has shown good results in expanding business and meeting the requirements of realizing large-scale purchases and sales.

### 改革农村商业网促进农业生产  部分地区做到乡乡有店、社社有点、村村有买卖

    改革农村商业网促进农业生产
    部分地区做到乡乡有店、社社有点、村村有买卖
    本报讯  为使商业工作更好地为促进工农业生产和便利群众购销服务，全国各地普遍重视农村商业网的改革工作。从十七个省、市进行全区或部分商业网改革的情况来看，改革后的农村购销点，比原来增加50％到一倍以上。基本上可以达到“乡乡有店、社社有点（或供销部）、村村有买卖”，农民买卖一般日用必需品可以不出村。根据一些地区的典型调查，由于农民就近可以买到日常生活必需品和出售零星土产、废品，每户每年约可节省十个劳动日。
    原有的农村商业网存在什么问题呢？一方面大部分商店集中在集镇，乡村的购销点过少，形成集镇上机构臃肿，人浮于事，乡村居民买卖东西不方便；另一方面，农村商业网的分布与农业集体化了的生产单位结合不够，商业工作和农业生产活动往往不够合拍，特别是生产大跃进以来，农村里劳动十分紧张。因此，必须抓紧对农村商业网的改革。
    各地在改革农村商业网工作中，普遍贯彻了更好地为生产服务，有利于实现大购大销、便于基层党的统一领导的要求。在做法上，在党委统一领导下，统一规划，注意各方面协作，充分依靠群众，把国家力量与群众力量结合起来。改革的重点大体上分为三个方面：平原地区把购销点下伸到农业社，使商业网进一步接近生产单位，基本上达到“乡乡有店、社社有点、村村有买卖”；山区和边远地区大力发展购销点和流动购销组织，普遍建立和加强采购加工网，实行就地收购、就地加工、大力利用山区资源；集镇商业网和商业人员，除动员一部分到农村进行购销和参加生产外，对留在集镇的商店和人员一般都作了适当调整，注意到了发挥集镇在农村中一定经济中心的作用。
    在改革农村商业网当中，由于各地具体条件不同，采取的形式也是多种多样：有的是由农业社建立供销部；有的是组织商贩在农业社建立服务商店；有的由国营商店下伸分销店；还有的是在农业社设代购代销员。其中由农业社建立供销部是一种新的商业组织形式，目前进行试点或全面推广的地区已经有十七个省、市，在试验和推广中取得了不少经验。
    农村商业网经过改革，在扩大业务，实现大购大销的要求方面已显示出很好的效果。
