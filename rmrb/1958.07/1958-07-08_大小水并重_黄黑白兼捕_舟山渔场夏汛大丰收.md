With the beacon of the General Line illuminating the way, the 50,000 fishermen of the Zhoushan Special District, one of China's fishing centers, have been braving the waves and working the 500-plus-li expanse of the East China Sea, reaping a bumper summer harvest. According to recent statistics from the Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic Products Company, over 1.7 million dan of large yellow croaker, cuttlefish, and Chinese herring have been caught. Although the summer fishing season is not yet over, the current yield already exceeds the total summer yield of 1.04 million dan last year by more than 60%.

This year's summer production in the Zhoushan Special District specifically embodies the spirit of the General Line. Based on the new circumstances of multiple fish species appearing simultaneously and staggered timing and location of fish emergence, the CPC Zhoushan Prefectural Committee proposed a new policy of giving equal emphasis to both large and small catches, and simultaneously harvesting yellow (large yellow croaker), black (cuttlefish), white (Chinese herring, also known as swift fish), and red (jellyfish). In conjunction with this policy, a technical innovation campaign centered on mechanization and motorization was widely launched. At the same time, a large-scale General Line propaganda campaign was launched on the fishing grounds. Fishermen at sea held more than 200 "ship-head meetings" (small group meetings held by gathering several fishing boats head-to-head) to discuss the General Line. Cadres at all levels, led by Wang Yumin, acting secretary of the Prefectural Committee, also actively promoted newspapers while at sea. As a result, the vast number of fishermen not only became highly motivated, but also broke the superstitious idea that nothing could be done in small-catch production. The number of people going to sea during the early fourth lunar month for small-catch production doubled compared to last year, catching 450,000 dan of fish, more than double the increase in large-catch production in the early fourth month, and this large-catch production increased more than six times compared to the same period last year.

The Prefectural Committee summarized the experience of this period and called on all fishermen in the district to continue to implement the above policies, so that large-catch production and small-catch production can closely cooperate and promote each other, and strive for a complete victory in the summer fishing season.

### 大小水并重  黄黑白兼捕  舟山渔场夏汛大丰收

    大小水并重  黄黑白兼捕
    舟山渔场夏汛大丰收
    本报讯  在总路线的灯塔照耀下，我国渔业中心之一的舟山专区五万渔民，乘风破浪地转战在五百多里长的东海上，获得了夏汛大丰收。据浙江省水产公司最近统计，已捕到大黄花鱼、墨鱼、鳓鱼等一百七十多万担。夏汛虽然尚未结束，但已比去年夏汛总产量一百零四万担增加了60％以上。
    今年舟山专区夏汛生产具体体现了总路线的精神。中共舟山地委根据今年多种鱼类同时并发和鱼发时间地点交叉的新情况，提出了大水生产和小水生产并重，黄（大黄花鱼）黑（墨鱼）、白（鳓鱼，又名快鱼）、红（海蜇）兼捕的新方针。结合这个方针，广泛开展以机帆化为中心的技术革新运动。同时，渔场上又展开了大规模的总路线宣传活动，出海渔民举行了两百多次讨论总路线的船头会（几只渔船头碰头地集在一起开小组会），以地委代书记王裕民为首的各级干部还在下海时积极推销报纸。因此，广大渔民不仅斗志昂扬，而且打破了小水生产无可为的迷信思想，旧历4月初小水的出海人数即比去年增加一倍，捕鱼四十五万担，比4月初大水增产一倍多，而这次大水又比去年同期增产六倍多。
    地委总结了这一时期的经验，号召全区渔民继续贯彻上述方针，使大水生产和小水生产密切配合，互相推动，争取夏汛全胜。
