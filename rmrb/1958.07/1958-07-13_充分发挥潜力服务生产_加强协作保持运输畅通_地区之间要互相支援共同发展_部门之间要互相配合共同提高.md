Xinhua News Agency, July 12th: Strengthening transportation collaboration and fully leveraging the effectiveness of various modes of transportation are crucial to resolving transportation issues in the current Great Leap Forward in production and construction. To promote transportation collaboration among various regions, the Ministry of Communications of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a symposium on transportation collaboration. Representatives from eight provinces, cities, and autonomous regions—Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Hebei, Shanxi, Beijing, Shanghai, and Inner Mongolia—participated in the meeting, reporting and exchanging information on the organization of transportation collaboration in their respective areas, and discussing ways to further promote transportation collaboration in the future.

The meeting was presided over by Zeng Shan, Minister of Communications of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He believed that the meeting would play a significant role in promoting transportation collaboration across the country. In his summary report, he said that China's socialist construction has seen an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. This year's freight volume will inevitably and has already increased dramatically. Currently, transportation nationwide has begun to tighten, and the degree of tension is expected to increase further. The number of railcars loaded in the first quarter of this year increased by 20% compared to the same period last year, and the second quarter increased by 33% compared to the first quarter. It is estimated that the fourth quarter will increase by about 50% compared to the first quarter. Some railway lines are now experiencing a phenomenon of a large number of materials not being transported in a timely manner. For example, 300,000 tons of coal from Yangquan, Shanxi, cannot be transported in time, even leading to spontaneous combustion. Highways and shipping have also seen transportation capacity lagging behind the growth in freight volume. How to resolve the current contradiction between transportation capacity and freight volume? Zeng Shan said that while we must go all out, aim high, and build more railways, highways, waterways, and air routes quickly, well, and economically, and increase transportation equipment and tools, we must also widely carry out technological revolution in the transportation sector, and at the same time, strengthen transportation production work, especially transportation collaboration. He believes that strengthening transportation collaboration is a crucial aspect of the transportation sector's implementation of the General Line and improvement of productivity.

The representatives present introduced a large number of vivid facts, proving that collaboration is a good way to tap the potential of existing transportation equipment. Some transportation departments, due to good collaboration, have increased transportation efficiency by 30%-60%, or even doubled, without increasing or minimally increasing investment and equipment; some departments have established communist, comradely mutual assistance and cooperation production relations in the process of collaboration, greatly boosting production enthusiasm and improving productivity. After the Great Leap Forward in production, Leshan Prefecture in Sichuan Province found its transportation capacity to be severely insufficient, often resulting in the backlog of materials. Since the Leshan Prefectural Party Committee organized the motorcade, transportation station, traffic management station, highway maintenance section, wooden boat cooperative,搬运 company, and various consigning units to engage in a large-scale collaboration competition, the situation of goods waiting for vehicles, ships, and loading and unloading has been basically eliminated, and the utilization rate of transportation equipment has reached 95%, ensuring that products can be shipped out in a timely manner after leaving the factory. Therefore, some people say, "Without collaboration and cooperation, it would simply be a major disaster for socialist production." Heilongjiang Province also experienced transportation tensions in 1956. In 1957, thanks to the Provincial Party Committee convening a transportation collaboration meeting and strengthening the organization of transportation collaboration, and the establishment of a joint office of relevant departments, although the railway freight volume increased by 10% compared to 1956 and the highway freight volume increased by 21%, the transportation situation was very normal. Before 1957, the collaborative relationship between Shanghai's ports and railways was not good, and neither side could complete its tasks. During the rectification movement, workers posted many big-character posters criticizing and exposing the departmentalism of leading cadres. One big-character poster sharply criticized: "Rockets to the moon are just around the corner, when will the road and port relationship be resolved?" Leading cadres were awakened from their "big port" and "big railway" departmentalist thinking in the fierce fire. After the "double anti" movement, cadres on both sides improved their understanding, and from a political standpoint, improved their collaborative relationship and jointly established a joint office. As a result, the phenomenon of empty trucks was basically eliminated, the average berthing time of barges was shortened by 60%, and both sides received red flags for overfulfilling their tasks.

The meeting believed that in recent years, various regions have begun to pay attention to organizing transportation collaboration. Some places have accumulated many good experiences. However, on a national scale, transportation collaboration has not yet received widespread attention. The situation in various regions shows that the failure of collaboration is mainly due to departmentalism. Many transportation departments do not have a clear concept of serving production and the needs of the people's lives, and the procedures and regulations for consignment of goods and the methods of fines are too troublesome, and even unreasonable in some places. Some transportation departments prefer to transport long distances and are unwilling to transport short distances; they prefer to transport whole batches of goods and are unwilling to transport small goods; they prefer to run on good roads and are unwilling to run on bad roads; they only consider whether there are return goods, regardless of urgency. There are also phenomena of mutual non-cooperation and non-consideration among transportation departments, which creates a situation where, on the one hand, transportation capacity is extremely insufficient, and on the other hand, there is some waste.

The meeting believed that the most important experience in organizing transportation collaboration is to put politics in command, rely on the masses, strengthen ideological education, and enable the vast majority of employees to establish the socialist collaboration thinking of "everyone for me, I for everyone." The general principle of transportation collaboration is to always maintain smooth transportation, improve transportation efficiency, ensure industrial and agricultural production, and ensure the needs of the people's lives. Under the general principle, the collaboration principle between transportation departments and consigning departments should be: "Serve production, save transportation capacity." The principle of transportation collaboration between regions should be: "Support each other, develop together." The transportation lines in many regions intersect with each other, and it is necessary to support each other in organizing sources of goods, and to organize round-trip transportation in a planned way, and to minimize one-way transportation, so as to save the country's transportation capacity. The principle of collaboration among various transportation departments should be: "Cooperate with each other, improve together."

Based on existing experience and after discussion, the meeting believed that organizing transportation collaboration should mainly focus on the following links: (1) Balancing the consignment plans of the materials departments and the transportation plans of the transportation departments, as well as the transportation plans between various transportation departments, and carrying out transportation in a coordinated manner. (2) Organizing balanced transportation. (3) Unifying the control of sources of goods, distributing them in a planned way, comprehensively utilizing transportation equipment (including transportation equipment of organs), and fully leveraging the effectiveness of various transportation tools. (4) Organizing collaborative cooperation in transportation operations such as loading and unloading, and cargo handover among various enterprises. (5) Organizing joint labor of various departments. (6) Organizing joint transportation of various transportation tools.

The meeting also believed that strengthening organizational leadership is of decisive significance for promoting transportation collaboration. Each province, city, district, and county should have a specialized organization and dedicated personnel responsible for leading transportation collaboration work. For example, some provinces and cities can organize transportation committees to be responsible for resolving the balance between transportation capacity and freight volume in their respective regions, formulating major measures to ensure the completion of transportation tasks and the division of labor and collaboration methods of various transportation tools, disseminating various collaborative experiences, and guiding collaboration. In addition to establishing strong collaborative organizations in transportation hub areas, it is also necessary to have daily working bodies. Joint offices should also be organized between transportation departments with relatively heavy transportation tasks and relatively complex relationships, or between transportation departments and consignment departments, to be responsible for handling daily collaborative work.

    充分发挥潜力服务生产
    加强协作保持运输畅通
    地区之间要互相支援共同发展　部门之间要互相配合共同提高
    据新华社12日讯　加强运输协作，充分发挥各种运输工具的效力，是解决当前生产建设大跃进中运输问题的重要关键之一。为了推动各个地区运输部门加强运输协作，中共中央交通工作部最近专门召开了运输协作问题座谈会。参加这次会议的四川、黑龙江、湖北、河北、山西、北京、上海、内蒙古等八个省、市、自治区的代表，在会上汇报和交流了各地组织运输协作的情况和经验，讨论了今后如何进一步推动各地搞好运输协作的办法。
    这次会议由中共中央交通工作部部长曾山主持。他认为这次会议对于推动全国各地加强运输协作会起很好的作用。他在总结报告中说，我国社会主义建设事业，出现了史无前例的大跃进的新形势。今年的货物运输量，必然而且已经空前增长。目前全国的运输已经开始紧张，今后紧张的程度还会有所发展。今年第一季铁路的装车数比去年同期增长20％，第二季又比第一季增长33％。估计第四季将比第一季增长50％左右。某些铁路线现在已经出现了大量物资不能及时运输的现象。例如山西的阳泉煤已有三十万吨不能及时运出来，甚至因此发生自燃现象。公路和航运方面也出现了运输力量跟不上运量增长的情况。如何解决当前运输能力和运输量不相适应的矛盾呢？曾山说，既要鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设更多的铁路、公路、航道和航空线，增加更多的运输设备和运输工具，又要在交通运输部门广泛开展技术革命，同时还必须加强运输的生产工作，特别要加强运输的协作。他认为加强运输协作是交通运输部门贯彻总路线和提高生产力的带有关键性的一个重要方面。
    到会的代表介绍了大量的活生生的事实，证明了协作是发挥现有运输设备的潜力的好办法。有些运输部门由于协作得好，在不增加或少增加投资和设备的条件下，提高了运输效率30％—60％，有的提高了一倍；有些部门在协作中建立了共产主义的、同志式的互助合作的生产关系，大大发挥了生产积极性，提高了生产力。四川乐山专区，在生产大跃进后，运输力量显得非常不足，经常积压物资。自从乐山地委把汽车队、运输站、交通管理站、公路养护段、木船合作社、搬运公司和各托运的单位都组织起来大搞协作竞赛以后，基本上消灭了货物等车、等船、等装卸的情况，运输工具的使用率达到95％，做到了产品出厂就能及时运出。因此有些人说，“不搞协作配合，简直是社会主义生产的大灾难。”黑龙江省在1956年也曾出现过运输紧张情况。1957年由于省委召开了运输协作会议，加强了运输协作的组织工作，成立了各有关部门的联合办公室，这一年虽然铁路运量比1956年增加了10％，公路运量增加21％，运输情况却很正常。1957年前上海的港湾和铁路协作关系搞不好，双方都完不成任务。整风运动中，工人贴了许多大字报批评揭发领导干部的本位主义思想。有一张大字报尖锐地批评：“火箭上月球，指日可待，路、港关系何时解决？”领导干部在烈火猛烧中才从“大港”“大铁路”等本位主义思想中惊醒过来。双反以后，两方面干部都提高了认识，从政治出发搞好协作关系，共同成立了联合办公室。结果基本上消灭了汽车放空现象，驳船站留时间平均缩短了60％，双方都因超额完成任务得了红旗。
    会议认为，近几年来，各地已开始注意组织运输协作。有些地方已积累了不少好经验。但是就全国范围来看，运输协作还没有引起各地普遍重视。各地情况说明，协作搞不好，主要是本位主义思想作怪，不少运输部门为生产、为人民生活需要服务的观念不明确，货物托运手续和规章制度、罚款办法过于麻烦，甚至有些地方不合理。还有些运输部门喜欢运长途，不愿运短途；喜欢运整批货物，不愿运零货；喜欢跑好路，不愿跑孬路；单纯考虑有没有回头货，不管缓急。在运输部门之间也有互相不配合、不照顾的现象，这样就形成一方面运输力量极感不足，另一方面又有些浪费。
    会议认为，组织运输协作的最重要的经验是政治挂帅，依靠群众，加强思想教育，使广大职工树立“人人为我，我为人人”的社会主义协作思想。运输协作的总原则是经常保持运输畅通、提高运输效率、保证工农业生产、保证人民生活的需要。在总的原则下，运输部门和托运部门的协作原则应该是：“服务生产，节约运力”。地区之间的运输协作的原则应该是：“互相支援，共同发展”。很多地区的运输线路，是相互交叉的，需要在组织货源上互相支援，有计划地组织往返运输，尽量减少单程运输，以节省国家的运力。各个运输部门之间的协作原则应该是：“互相配合，共同提高”。
    根据现有经验并且经过讨论，会议认为，组织运输协作，主要应当抓紧以下几个环节：（1）使物资部门的托运计划和运输部门的运输计划，以及各个运输部门之间的运输计划互相平衡、互相衔接，协调地进行运输。（2）组织平衡运输。（3）统一掌握货源，有计划地进行分配，综合利用运输工具（包括机关运输工具），充分发挥各种运输工具的效能。（4）组织各企业间装卸、货物交接等运输作业的协作配合。（5）组织各个部门的联合劳动。（6）组织各种运输工具的联合运输。
    会议还认为，加强组织领导对于推动运输协作具有决定性的意义。各省、市、区和县都应该有专门组织和专人负责领导运输协作工作。如有些省、市可以组织运输委员会，负责解决本地区的运输力和运输量的平衡问题、制定保证完成运输任务的重大措施和各种运输工具的分工协作办法，传播各种协作经验，指导协作。在交通枢纽地区除了应该建立强有力的协作组织外，还需要有日常的办事机构。运输任务比较繁重，关系比较复杂的运输部门之间或运输部门和托运部门之间还应该组织联合办公室，负责处理日常协作工作。
