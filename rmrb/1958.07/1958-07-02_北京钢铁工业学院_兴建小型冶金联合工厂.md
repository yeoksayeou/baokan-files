Xinhua News Agency, 1st July—The teachers and students of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Engineering are building a small-scale integrated metallurgical plant with an annual output of 20,000 tons of steel.

    In order to celebrate the Party's birthday, the school's teachers, students, and staff have thrown themselves into the intense labor of building the plant. Students majoring in iron casting created a method of accelerating bricklaying using "mud boxes," which resulted in the successful construction of a 1.7 cubic meter indigenous blast furnace in four days. Yesterday, when the first stream of molten iron flowed out of the furnace, the teachers and students jumped and cheered with excitement.

    At present, a rolling mill with an annual output of 20,000 to 40,000 tons of steel has also been basically completed. The design and construction of the steelmaking converter are progressing rapidly, striving to produce steel before "August 1st" (Army Day).

    This small-scale integrated metallurgical plant includes four parts: iron smelting, steelmaking, steel rolling, and casting. In addition to putting some of the original experimental equipment into production, the school's teachers, students, and staff designed and built the steelmaking converter, as well as the complete set of main equipment and sites for iron smelting and steel rolling. After the completion of this small-scale integrated metallurgical plant, it will not only open up a venue for the institute to implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, but also create favorable conditions for improving teaching quality and making scientific research serve production in the future.

    北京钢铁工业学院
    兴建小型冶金联合工厂
    新华社1日讯　北京钢铁工业学院师生正在兴建一座年产两万吨钢的小型冶金联合工厂。
    为了庆祝党的生日，学校的师生员工们投入了建厂的紧张劳动。铸铁专业的学生创造了“装泥匣子”加速砌砖的办法，使一座容积一点七立方公尺的土高炉在四天内就胜利建成了。昨天，当第一炉铁水从炉内奔流出来时，师生们兴奋得跳跃欢呼起来。
    目前，一座年产量两万吨到四万吨钢材的轧钢厂也已经基本建成。炼钢转炉的设计和施工正在迅速进展，争取在“八一”前出钢。
    这座小型冶金联合工厂包括炼铁、炼钢、轧钢和铸造四部分，学校除将一些原有的实验设备投入生产以外，炼钢的转炉和炼铁、轧钢的全套主要设备和场地都由师生员工自己动手设计和建造。这座小型联合冶金工厂建成后，不仅为学院贯彻教育结合生产劳动的方针开辟了场所，同时将为今后提高教学质量，使科学研究为生产服务创造有利的条件。
