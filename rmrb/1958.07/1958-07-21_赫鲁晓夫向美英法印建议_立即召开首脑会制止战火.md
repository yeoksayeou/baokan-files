Xinhua News Agency, July 20th, Moscow dispatch from TASS, Moscow, July 19th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, wrote letters on July 19th to US President Eisenhower, British Prime Minister Macmillan, French Premier De Gaulle, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru, suggesting an immediate summit of these countries with the participation of the UN Secretary-General to take immediate measures to halt the military conflict that has begun in the Middle East. The letter states that the date and location of the meeting would not be an obstacle. The Soviet government suggests meeting in Geneva on July 22nd.

In his letter to Eisenhower, Khrushchev said: "The armed intervention by the United States in Lebanon first, and then by Britain in Jordan, as well as the threat of intervention looming over Iraq and all countries in the Arab world, may lead to extremely dangerous and unforeseen consequences, which may cause an uncontrollable chain reaction. At this historically critical and dangerous moment, the Soviet Union, which has consistently strived for world peace, against war, and for peaceful coexistence, cannot ignore what is happening in the Middle East region, which is directly adjacent to the Soviet border. In resolving the issue of war or peace, the Soviet Union cannot stand idly by."

The head of the Soviet government stated in his letter that convening a summit of major powers to resolve the military conflict that has begun in the Middle East would be the wisest action for our governments to take under the current circumstances.

Khrushchev wrote, "We suggest convening a meeting on any day and at any time, the sooner the better. History does not give us much time to prevent war, to prevent the destruction of billions of people, and to prevent the destruction of enormous material and cultural wealth. The Soviet government is willing to convene a meeting at any location, including Washington, if Geneva is unsuitable for Western countries for some reason. The most important thing is not to delay, because the cannons have already begun firing."

Khrushchev told Eisenhower that the aggressors are playing with fire. It is always easier to ignite a fire than to extinguish it. However, if a fire has already started, it is better to put it out at the beginning than to put it out when the flames are raging and spreading to neighboring houses. Under the current conditions, there can only be one correct solution, and that is to immediately withdraw the occupying forces from the Middle East and give the people of the region the conditions to decide their own destiny.

Khrushchev pointed out in his letter that the Soviet government believes that after the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India have formulated specific proposals to stop the military conflict in the Middle East, these proposals must be submitted to the United Nations Security Council, and this United Nations body should discuss these proposals with the participation of representatives of the Arab countries. The meeting could also discuss the issue of ceasing arms supplies to Middle Eastern countries, as the Soviet Union has previously suggested. (Full text on page four)

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th dispatch, Moscow dispatch from TASS: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, said in a letter written on July 19th to Indian Prime Minister Nehru that we are currently at one of the most critical junctures in human history due to the US aggression against Lebanon and the British aggression against Jordan. He said that every hour of delay harbors serious dangers for the cause of peace, and all peace-loving forces should mobilize to stop the terrible threat looming over the world. In this situation, inaction and a wait-and-see attitude could lead to disaster.

The Soviet government believes that holding a summit of major government leaders for the noble purpose of taking measures to stop the military conflict in the Middle East would be a great contribution to the cause of peace and security of all countries. The Soviet government has no doubt that peace-loving India will speak with a significant voice to safeguard the cause for which the heroic Indian people have been unremittingly striving. The Soviet government hopes that the Indian Prime Minister will do everything possible to fully promote the success of the collective efforts of peace-loving countries to stop the approaching disaster as early as possible while it is still possible.

### 赫鲁晓夫向美英法印建议  立即召开首脑会制止战火

    赫鲁晓夫向美英法印建议
    立即召开首脑会制止战火
    新华社20日讯  塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫19日写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔、英国首相麦克米伦、法国内阁总理戴高乐和印度总理尼赫鲁，建议立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的这些国家的首脑会议，以便马上采取措施，停止中近东已经开始的军事冲突。信中说，关于会议的日期和地点问题不会成为障碍。苏联政府建议7月22日在日内瓦会晤。
    赫鲁晓夫在给艾森豪威尔的信中说：美国先在黎巴嫩、随后英国在约旦进行的武装干涉，以及笼罩着伊拉克和阿拉伯世界所有国家的干涉威胁，可能导致极端危险和无法预见的后果，可能引起无法制止的连锁反应。在这历史上刻不容缓的危险的时刻，为世界和平、为反对战争、为和平共处而始终一贯奋斗的苏联，不能对直接邻近苏联边境的中近东地区所发生的事情置之不理。在解决战争还是和平的问题时，苏联不能袖手旁观。
    苏联政府首脑的信中说，召开大国首脑会议来解决中近东开始的军事冲突，将是我们各国政府在目前的条件下最明智的行动。
    赫鲁晓夫写道，我们建议在任何日子和任何时刻召开会议，越快越好。历史给我们用来防止战争、防止亿万人民遭到毁灭、防止巨大的物质和文化财富遭到毁灭的时间并不多。苏联政府愿意在任何地点召开会议，包括华盛顿在内，要是日内瓦由于某种原因不适合西方国家的话。最主要的是不能拖延，因为大炮在开始射击了。
    赫鲁晓夫对艾森豪威尔说，侵略者正在玩火。燃起火灾永远比扑灭火灾容易。但是，如果火灾已经燃起，那么在一开始就扑灭火焰要比在火焰炽烈和波及到邻近房屋时再扑灭要好。在目前的条件下，最正确的解决办法只可能有一个，这就是立即把占领军撤出中近东，并且给这个地区各国人民以自己决定自己命运的条件。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中指出，苏联政府认为必须使苏联、美国、英国、法国和印度各国政府首脑会议在拟定停止中近东军事冲突的具体建议以后，把这些建议提交给联合国安全理事会，并且使联合国的这个机构在阿拉伯国家的代表参加下讨论这些建议。会议也可以讨论关于停止向中近东国家供应武器的问题，正如苏联以前所建议过的一样。（全文见第四版）
    据新华社20日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在19日写给印度总理尼赫鲁的信中说，由于美国侵略黎巴嫩和英国侵略约旦，我们目前正处在人类历史上的一个最严重的关头。他说，每一小时的拖延都对和平事业孕育着严重的危险，一切爱好和平的力量都应当动员起来去制止笼罩着世界的可怕威胁，在这种局势下，无所作为和抱观望态度可能导致灾难。
    苏联政府认为，为了采取措施制止中近东的军事冲突这一崇高目的而举行大国政府首脑会议，将是对和平和各国安全的事业的伟大贡献。苏联政府不怀疑，爱好和平的印度将会讲出有份量的话，来维护英勇的印度人民一直为之不懈奋斗的事业。苏联政府希望印度总理能尽一切可能，全力促进爱好和平的国家为了在还有可能的时候及早制止逼近的灾难而作的集体努力获得成功。（全文见第四版）
