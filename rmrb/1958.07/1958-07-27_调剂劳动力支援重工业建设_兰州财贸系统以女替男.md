	Transferring Labor to Support Heavy Industry Construction
	Lanzhou Finance and Trade System Replaces Men with Women

	(Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 26th dispatch) The Lanzhou Municipality finance and trade system and service industries are adopting measures to replace male workers with female workers, transferring male employees to support heavy industry construction.

	In the Lanzhou Municipality finance and trade system and service industries, 70% of the employees are young and strong men, who are urgently needed by the heavy industry construction departments; at the same time, most of the work in these departments can be undertaken by women. Therefore, the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to pilot this first in the Zhonghua Road Department Store and then promote it throughout the city.

	The Zhonghua Road Department Store originally had thirty-nine male employees and nineteen female employees. From July 15th to 19th, with the exception of three men who were retained as purchasers, salesmen, and handymen, the positions of Party Branch Secretary, Store Director, Business Team Leader, Chairman of the Trade Union, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Branch, Accountant, and salespersons were all filled by women. Twenty-nine of the newly arrived female employees were transferred from other units, and eleven were recruited from the family members of employees of the Lanzhou Municipal Department Store Company. Although there were many newcomers, the store's business was not affected. On their first day of work, they were praised by customers.

	When this store initially implemented this measure, some people expressed doubts about whether the store's work could continue to be done well after the male employees were transferred away, and advocated that it would be best to keep a few more male comrades. The newly arrived salespersons also lacked confidence because they were not yet familiar with the store's business. In response to this situation, the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League leaders in the store took the lead at all levels, mobilized section by section, and launched a debate among all employees with "breaking superstitions and liberating thought" as the main content. Through the debate, everyone's thinking was liberated, doubts were eliminated, and confidence in overcoming difficulties was established. The newly arrived women all promised to become familiar with the business as quickly as possible. Those who originally worked in the store also promised to help the new comrades learn and become familiar with business knowledge as much as possible. They all actively studied the business, familiarized themselves with commodity prices and locations. Some people were still standing at the counter studying the business until 12 o'clock at night. The old salespersons in each group were responsible for contracting to teach business knowledge. Some salespersons even used the evening time to perform the seven service covenants on the spot. Therefore, these people quickly became familiar with the business.

	Now the male employees who have been transferred from this store will go to work in local state-owned steel plants, iron plants, and other large industrial construction departments. According to the requirements of the Lanzhou Municipal Committee, the city's finance and trade system and other departments will transfer 10,000 male employees.

    调剂劳动力支援重工业建设
    兰州财贸系统以女替男
    本报兰州26日电　兰州市财贸系统和服务行业正在采取以女代男的措施，把男职工调出来支援重工业建设。
    兰州市财贸系统和服务业的职工，70％是年青力壮的男人，这些人是重工业建设部门迫切需要的；同时，这些部门的绝大部分工作可以由妇女担任。因此，中共兰州市委便决定首先在中华路百货商店试办，然后在全市推广。
    中华路百货商店原有男职工三十九人，女职工十九人。从7月15日到19日，除采购员、推销员和勤杂人员三个男人未调换外，党支部书记、商店主任、业务组长、工会主席、共青团支部书记、会计及营业员等全由妇女担任。新来的女职工有二十九人是从其他单位调进的，有十一个是从兰州市百货公司的职工家属中吸收的。虽然新手多，但商店业务并未受到影响。她们在正式上班的第一天，就受到顾客的表扬。
    这个商店在开始实行这项措施时，有一部分人对男职工调走后能否继续搞好商店工作表示怀疑，主张最好把男同志多留几个。新来的营业员，因对店内业务还不熟悉，信心也不足。根据这个情况，店内党、政、工、团领导，层层挂帅，分片动员，发动全体职工开展了“破除迷信，解放思想”为主要内容的辩论。经过辩论，大家思想解放了，消除了怀疑情绪，树立了克服困难的信心。新来的妇女纷纷保证以最快的速度熟悉业务。原来在店内工作的人也保证，尽量帮助新来的同志学习和熟悉业务知识。她们都积极钻研业务，熟悉商品价格、货位，有的人到深夜十二点钟还站在柜台里学习业务，各组的老营业员负责包干教业务知识，还有的售货员利用晚上时间，把七项服务公约作了现场表演，因此这些人很快熟悉了业务。
    现在这个商店被调换出来的男职工，将赴地方国营炼钢厂、炼铁厂以及其他大工业建设部门工作。根据兰州市委要求，全市财贸系统和其他部门抽调出一万个男职工来。
