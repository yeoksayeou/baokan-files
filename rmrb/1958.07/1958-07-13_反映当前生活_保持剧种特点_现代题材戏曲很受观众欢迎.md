Modern Theme Opera is Very Popular with Audiences

(Our report) Modern theme opera united performances have been warmly welcomed by the capital's audiences for a month. Recently, the Office of the Modern Life Opera Performance Symposium of the Ministry of Culture and the Beijing Theater held an audience symposium. Audience activists from factories, troops, government agencies, schools, and neighborhoods who frequently contact the theater, as well as theater promoters, participated in the symposium.

Audiences from all walks of life warmly welcome opera performances reflecting modern life. Li Changjun, a worker from a government agency in Beijing, said: "After watching some of the operas, we all think that in the past, operas and dramas portrayed modern life more often, while operas portrayed modern life less often. Now, even Peking Opera is performing 'The White-Haired Girl,' which is truly a great leap forward for the opera world." Li Rong from the First Machine Tool Factory said: Young people didn't like Peking Opera in the past, but they love Peking Opera with modern themes like "The White-Haired Girl" and "Capturing the Bandit Chief Vulture Mountain." The content of Peking Opera "New Children's Heroes" is very good, and the ticket prices are not high. Once, when it was performed at the Xisi Printing Factory, it conflicted with a meeting time. The factory leaders learned that it was a modern play with great educational significance, so they changed the meeting time. According to statistics from the Beijing Theater, from June 13th to 20th, during this joint performance of modern theme operas, the attendance rate for the dozen or so performances at the theater reached 82.7%, while the theater's attendance rate before the joint performance was only 30% to 40%. The increase in theater attendance well illustrates the audience's welcome of modern theme opera.

At the symposium, everyone also offered some opinions on how operas can portray modern life more, faster, and better. Some people feel that some new operas have very good content, but not enough effort has been made to maintain the characteristics of each genre. Meng Run, a staff member of the Palace Museum, believes that modern operas are not written and performed in a timely manner. The Ming Tombs Reservoir project is very great, but Ping Opera has only now written and performed an opera reflecting this reality. If it could be written and performed earlier, the educational and motivational effect would be greater. Some comrades also pointed out that operas reflecting modern life are mostly adapted, and there are fewer original works. They hope that playwrights will immerse themselves in life, expand the range of topics, and create more new operas. The comrades who participated in the symposium expressed satisfaction with the operas "Liu Hulan," "Chaoyang Gully," "Mother," "Sanliwan," and "New Children's Heroes" that were performed this time.

Theater workers also expressed great confidence in staging modern operas. Since the joint performance of modern theme operas began, every promoter has enthusiastically promoted modern operas to the audience.

    反映当前生活　保持剧种特点
    现代题材戏曲很受观众欢迎
    本报讯　现代题材戏曲联合公演一个月来，已受到首都观众的热烈欢迎。最近文化部戏曲表现现代生活座谈会办公室和北京剧场召开了一次观众座谈会。与剧场经常联系的工厂、部队、机关、学校、街道观众积极分子，和剧场的宣传员都参加了座谈。
    各方面的观众对戏曲表现现代生活非常欢迎。北京市一个机关工作者李长俊说：“我们观摩了一些戏以后，大家认为，过去歌剧、话剧表现现代生活比较多，戏曲表现现代生活少，现在连京剧也演‘白毛女’了，真是戏曲界的大跃进。”第一机床厂李荣说：青年人过去不喜欢看京戏，但对现代题材的京戏“白毛女”、“智擒惯匪座山雕”却很爱看。京戏“新儿女英雄传”内容很好，票价也不高，有一次在西四印刷厂演出时和开会的时间冲突了，工厂领导了解到演的是现代戏，教育意义大，便更改了开会的时间。据北京剧场统计，这次现代题材戏曲联合公演，从6月13日到20日在该剧场演出的十几场，上座率达到82.7％，而联合公演以前剧场的上座率只不过30％到40％。剧场上座率的提高，很好的说明观众对现代题材戏曲的欢迎。
    座谈会上，大家对戏曲如何更多、更快、更好地表现现代生活也提出一些意见。有人觉得有些新戏内容很好，但在保持各个剧种特点方面还努力不够。故宫博物院工作人员孟润认为现代戏编演得还不够及时，十三陵水库工程很伟大，评剧到现在才编演了反映这个现实的戏。要是能够较早地编演出来，教育和鼓动作用会更大些。还有的同志指出反映现代生活的戏曲，改编的多，创作的少，希望剧作者深入生活，扩大题材面，多创作新戏。参加座谈会的同志对这次演出的“刘胡兰”、“朝阳沟”、“母亲”、“三里湾”、“新儿女英雄传”等剧都表示满意。
    剧场工作者对上演现代戏也表示很大的信心。从现代题材戏曲联合公演开始后，每一位宣传员都对观众热心地宣传现代戏。
