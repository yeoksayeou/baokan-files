Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, July 7th. The First Iron Smelting Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company continuously set new national records for the highest monthly average utilization coefficient of large and medium-sized blast furnaces in April, May, and June. In June, the monthly average utilization coefficient of all blast furnaces in the plant dropped to 0.548, meaning that only 0.548 cubic meters of effective blast furnace volume were needed to smelt one ton of iron, surpassing Anshan Iron and Steel, Shijingshan, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel plants, and taking the top spot among the country's iron smelting plants. Among them, the No. 1 blast furnace achieved an average utilization coefficient of 0.525 in June, surpassing the No. 1 blast furnace of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and also won the title of national "Blast Furnace Champion."

　　The blast furnaces of Benxi First Iron Smelting Plant are all old blast furnaces with forty years of history. Due to the reduction of the blast furnace utilization coefficient, their current pig iron production is twice as high as in their prime.

    老高炉得冠军
    本溪钢铁公司连创全国高炉利用系数最高纪录
    据新华社本溪7日电  本溪钢铁公司第一炼铁厂在4、5、6三个月中，连创全国大、中型高炉月平均利用系数的最新纪录。6月份，这个厂的全部高炉月平均利用系数降到零点五四八，即每炼一吨铁只需高炉有效容积零点五四八立方公尺，超过了鞍钢和石景山、太原钢铁厂，跃居全国炼铁厂的首位。其中的一号高炉，6月份平均利用系数达到零点五二五，赶过了太原钢铁厂一号高炉，也夺得了全国“高炉冠军”的称号。
    本溪第一炼铁厂的高炉都是具有四十年历史的老高炉。由于高炉利用系数降低，它们现在的生铁产量比青春时代还要高一倍。
