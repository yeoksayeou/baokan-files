    Meticulously, Diligently, and Carefully Manage Autumn Fields
    90% of Henan's Labor Force Participates in Field Management and Manure Accumulation
    Zhengzhou, July 28th (Our Dispatch) – Henan Province is vigorously carrying out an autumn field management campaign focused on achieving "six no's" (no missing seedlings or broken ridges, no waterlogging or drought, no barren or infertile land, no weeds, no pests and diseases, and no third-class crops). Currently, about 90% of the total labor force in the province is participating in autumn field management and manure accumulation. The area of autumn crops in the province that has achieved the "six no's" has reached more than 31.49 million mu. There have also emerged 442 "six no's" townships and 13,687 "six no's" communes in autumn fields.
    In autumn field management, various localities have adopted methods such as having the secretary take charge, cadres take responsibility for specific areas, conducting extensive debates, organizing professional teams, and carrying out inspections and evaluations to promote the rapid development of the "six no's" evaluation campaign. Shangqiu County established "Six No's" Autumn Field Management Committees in every township, and "Six No's" Groups and crop professional teams in every commune. The county established 3,564 sweet potato professional teams, 3,424 rice professional teams, 4,268 cotton professional teams, and 3,136 other crop professional teams. According to statistics on July 12th, the county replanted more than 173,000 mu, eliminated third-class seedlings on 32,000 mu, controlled pests and diseases on 155,000 mu, and carried out mid-tillage after rain on 590,000 mu. After Runan County launched a "six no's" evaluation and inspection campaign between townships, communes, and teams, all 310,000 mu of spring-sown crops in the county achieved "six no's," and 1 million mu out of 1.2 million mu of summer-sown crops achieved "six no's." The masses in the county are full of enthusiasm and confidence in striving for a bumper harvest.
    During the autumn field management campaign, various localities also conducted debates targeting the complacency and paralysis among some cadres and the masses after the summer sowing ended, promoting the formation of a high tide in the autumn field management campaign. After Zhu Ge Township in Yu County launched a large-scale debate, the number of people attending work every day in the township reached more than 12,000, accounting for 129% of the existing labor force.
    In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor in autumn field management, many counties have also adopted methods of having crop stations form teams, classifying plots one by one, making plans, and arranging labor. Yancheng County generally implemented a three-combination method, that is, combining weeding with seedling replanting, combining weeding with grass picking, and combining daytime with nighttime. After Fangcheng County conducted a plot-by-plot team formation for autumn crops, the county found that first-class seedlings accounted for 53.9%, second-class seedlings accounted for 33%, and third-class seedlings accounted for 13.1%. Based on the crop growth situation, labor was rationally arranged to strengthen the management of third-class and second-class seedlings.
    Recently, most areas of Henan Province have experienced continuous overcast and rainy weather, and weeds and seedlings are growing rapidly. In the "six no's" evaluation campaign, most areas have focused on weeding and manure accumulation. More than 4 million people across the province clear weeds in the fields, on the edges of fields, and on the edges of villages every day, and can clear weeds on more than 6 million mu every day. According to the latest statistics, more than 67.73 million mu of autumn fields in the province have completely eliminated weeds, accounting for 57.8% of the total area of autumn fields. Furthermore, there are 987 townships and more than 18,000 agricultural cooperatives that have become weed-free townships and weed-free cooperatives.
    Combined with weeding, the work of accumulating fertilizer has also been carried out quickly. From June 1st to July 15th, the province has fermented more than 50 billion jin of green manure.

    严密勤快细致地管理秋田
    河南百分之九十的劳力参加田间管理和积肥
    本报郑州28日电　河南省以实现“六无”（无缺苗断垅、无水旱灾害、无瘦田瘠地、无杂草、无病虫害、无三类作物）为主的秋田管理运动正在全省蓬勃开展。现在全省参加秋田管理和积肥运动的劳动力占劳力总数的90％左右，全省秋季作物实现六无的面积已达三千一百四十九万多亩，还出现了秋田“六无”乡四百四十二个，“六无”社一万三千六百八十七个。
    各地在秋田管理中，都采取了书记挂帅，干部分片包干，开展大辩论，组织专业队和检查评比等方法，推动“六无”评比运动迅速开展。商丘县乡乡都建立了“六无”秋田管理委员会，社社建立了“六无”小组和作物专业队，全县计建立了红薯专业队三千五百六十四个，水稻专业队三千四百二十四个，棉花专业队四千二百六十八个，其他作物专业队三千一百三十六个。到7月12日统计，全县共补苗十七万三千多亩，消灭了三类苗三万二千亩，消灭病虫害十五万五千亩，雨后中耕五十九万亩。汝南县掀起乡与乡、社与社、队与队的“六无”评比检查运动后，全县三十一万亩春播作物全部实现了“六无”，一百二十万亩夏播作物，实现“六无”的就有一百万亩。全县群众干劲冲天，争取丰收的信心十足。
    在开展秋田管理运动时，各地还针对夏播结束后，部分干部群众的自满麻痹思想进行了辩论，促进秋田管理运动形成高潮。禹县朱阁乡展开大辩论后，全乡每天出勤人数达一万二千多人，占现有劳力的129％。
    为了解决秋田管理工作中劳力不足的困难，不少县还采取作物站队、逐块分类、作出规划、安排劳力的办法。郾城县就普遍实行三结合办法，即锄地与补苗相结合、锄地与拾草相结合、白天与夜晚相结合的办法。方城县对秋作物进行逐块站队后，全县查出一类苗占53.9％，二类苗占33％，三类苗占13.1％，根据作物生长情况，合理安排劳力，加强对三类苗和二类苗的管理工作。
    最近河南省大部分地区连续阴雨，草苗争长，在“六无”评比运动中，大部分地区都把除草积肥作重点。全省每天都有四百多万人在田间、地边、村边清除杂草，每天能除杂草六百多万亩，据最近的统计，全省已经有六千七百七十三万多亩秋田全部消灭了杂草，占秋田总面积的57.8％，并且还有九百八十七个乡、一万八千多个农业社成为无草乡、无草社。
    结合除草，积肥工作开展得也很快。从6月1日到7月15日的统计，全省已沤制绿肥五百多亿斤。
