Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 8th: The broad masses of farmers in Baoding Special District, Hebei Province, are combining the struggle against drought and for autumn crop protection to launch a new upsurge in building mechanized wells, striving to achieve mechanized irrigation by July. Currently, more than 5,000 well-drilling teams are drilling more than 300 mechanized wells per day. It is estimated that with the current progress, the plan for 20,000 mechanized wells in the entire district can be completed by the end of July. In order to meet the demand for irrigation machinery such as locomotive boilers and gas engines needed for mechanized wells, machine and iron factories in twelve counties including Dingxing, Xushui, Dingxian, and Anguo in Baoding Special District are working day and night to produce them.

	The upsurge of Baoding Special District in building mechanized wells and seeking water from deep underground is a new development in water conservancy construction after the practice of fighting drought. Through water conservancy construction from last winter to this spring, the irrigated area of Baoding Special District has expanded from more than 4 million mu to more than 11.95 million mu, accounting for 83.7% of the total cultivated area in the district. Among the water conservancy projects, the area irrigated by brick wells, earthen wells, pits, ponds, canals and other sources accounts for as much as 97.4%. Due to the drought, the water level in these small wells and canal projects has generally dropped, and some have even dried up. From the results of the summer harvest, areas with large mechanized irrigation areas have increased production by more than 100%, while areas mainly relying on brick wells, earthen wells, and canal irrigation have increased production much more slowly. Anguo County has increased its wheat production by 2.7 times this year compared to last year due to the realization of mechanized water conservancy irrigation. However, Xincheng County mainly relies on brick wells, earthen wells, and pits and ponds, resulting in insufficient water sources, and wheat production only increased by about 10% compared to last year.

	After the test of the drought struggle, the Baoding Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China deeply felt that sufficient water sources are necessary for irrigation to ensure a good harvest. In order to promote the continued advancement of the water conservancy movement and ensure a leap in production, the Prefectural Committee therefore proposed the requirement of realizing mechanized irrigation throughout the district.

### 保定专区出现大搞机井新高潮

    保定专区
    出现大搞机井新高潮
    据新华社天津8日电  河北保定专区广大农民正结合抗旱保秋斗争，掀起大搞机井的新高潮，争取在7月份内实现灌溉机械化。现在五千多个打井班日打机井三百多眼，目前全区已经锥、打机井六千二百多眼。按当前进展情况估计，7月底就可以全部完成全区两万眼机井的计划。为了满足机井需用的锅驼机、煤气机等灌溉机械，保定专区的定兴、徐水、定县、安国等十二个县的机铁厂，正在日夜赶制。
    保定专区大搞机井、向地下深层要水的高潮，是经过抗旱斗争的实践，在水利建设上的新发展。经过去冬今春的水利建设，保定专区的灌溉面积已由四百多万亩扩大到一千一百九十五万多亩，占全区耕地面积83.7％。在水利工程中，依靠砖井、土井、坑塘、渠道等灌溉的面积却高达97.4％。由于干旱，这些小井和渠道工程的水位普遍下降，甚至干涸。从夏收结果看，凡是机械灌溉面积大的地区，都增产一倍以上，而主要靠砖井、土井、渠道灌溉的地方，增产就慢得多。安国县由于实现了水利灌溉机械化，今年小麦比去年增产二点七倍。而新城县主要依靠砖井、土井、坑塘，结果水源不足，小麦仅比去年增产10％左右。
    经过抗旱斗争的考验，中共保定地委深深感到，必须有足够的水源进行灌溉才能保证丰收。为了推动水利运动继续前进，保证生产跃进，因此地委提出了全区实现灌溉机械化的要求。
