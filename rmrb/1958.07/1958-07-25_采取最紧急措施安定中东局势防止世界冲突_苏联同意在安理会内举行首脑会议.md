Xinhua News Agency, July 24th, Moscow dispatch: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, wrote letters on July 23rd to the President of the United States, Eisenhower, the British Prime Minister, Macmillan, the French Premier, De Gaulle, and the Indian Prime Minister, Nehru, stating that the Soviet government agreed to hold a summit meeting of heads of government within the framework of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the situation in the Near and Middle East. The letters stated that the Soviet government proposed that the meeting begin in New York on July 28th.

Khrushchev wrote to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, France, and India on July 19th, suggesting that a five-nation summit meeting of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India, with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General, be convened immediately to take immediate measures to stop the military conflict that had already begun in the Near and Middle East. The heads of government of the aforementioned four countries wrote replies to this suggestion on July 20th and 22nd, respectively, and Khrushchev's letters yesterday were replies to their replies.

In his letters to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France, Khrushchev stated that the Soviet government believes that the threat to world peace is extremely serious and that all possible and most urgent measures must be taken to prevent a world conflict from occurring. We cannot diminish the danger of such a conflict, because some people are now advocating expanding the zone of aggression in the Middle East and are primarily plotting a military offensive against Iraq. It is precisely because of this that the Soviet Union has suggested convening a five-nation summit meeting with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General immediately. We are pleased to learn that the Soviet proposal has received a positive response from the President of the United States. The British Prime Minister, the French Premier, and the Indian Prime Minister have also expressed their willingness to hold such a meeting, and we would like to express our gratitude for this.

In his letters to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, France, and India, Khrushchev said: We can accept Macmillan's suggestion to convene a summit meeting of heads of government within the framework of the Security Council. The Soviet government already pointed out in its letter of July 19th that the Security Council should not be avoided. In view of the need to take urgent measures to maintain peace, we believe that the form of the summit meeting is not of decisive significance in this situation. What is important is to hold this meeting as soon as possible in order to find the right solutions as quickly as possible to maintain and consolidate peace, stabilize the situation in the Near and Middle East, and ease international tensions.

We also agree with Macmillan's suggestion that this special meeting of the Security Council should not propose any resolutions that have not been agreed upon in advance, and that its purpose is only to reach an agreement, not to determine differences through voting.

The Soviet government's starting point is that the heads of government will be able to conduct joint consultations that are not limited to formal procedures in order to achieve the most rapid and constructive solutions conducive to maintaining and consolidating peace.

These letters emphasized that since the Security Council is currently discussing issues of particular importance from the perspective of maintaining peace and ensuring security, rather than general routine matters, we believe that, under the current circumstances, it would be beneficial to involve India in the work of the Security Council. Because India is a large Asian country and a country that is recognized as advocating the consolidation of peace. Khrushchev told the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France that, unlike a so-called permanent member of the Security Council that does not actually represent anyone, India's participation would be truly beneficial. We believe that it is necessary to allow Indian Prime Minister Nehru to participate in the work of the Security Council as a representative of India, and he has agreed to attend the summit meeting of heads of government.

As for the Soviet Union, since the British Prime Minister, the French Premier, the Indian Prime Minister, and the President of the United States have agreed to personally attend the special meeting of the Security Council, the Soviet Union will be represented at this meeting by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

It goes without saying that the relevant Arab governments should be involved in the Security Council's discussion of the issue with the participation of the aforementioned five heads of government.

The Soviet government hopes to know as soon as possible the opinions of these four governments on the date of convening a Security Council meeting with the participation of heads of government.

In his letter to Eisenhower, Khrushchev also mentioned that he did not want to argue about the causes that caused the tension and threatened peace in the Near and Middle East. He said that he had already talked about the Soviet government's views on all these issues in his letter of July 19th. However, I want to firmly deny the assertion you mentioned in your letter that the Soviet Union is supporting the forces of expansion and aggression in the world. If anyone in the past was unclear about who was truly pursuing a policy of expansion and aggression that threatened peace and the security of all peoples after the United States carried out armed intervention in Lebanon and Britain carried out armed intervention in Jordan, then they would no longer have any doubts now.

In his letter to Nehru, Khrushchev also thanked him for his quick reply to Khrushchev's letter of July 19th. Khrushchev said that we are also pleased to know that our views on the situation in the Near and Middle East in recent days are consistent, and that our views on the need to take urgent measures to eliminate the current international crisis through negotiations are also consistent. Khrushchev concluded by expressing his conviction that India's active participation in the proposed meeting would help stop the conflict in the Near and Middle East and prevent threats to universal peace.

### 采取最紧急措施安定中东局势防止世界冲突  苏联同意在安理会内举行首脑会议

　　采取最紧急措施安定中东局势防止世界冲突
    苏联同意在安理会内举行首脑会议
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫23日分别写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔、英国首相麦克米伦、法国总理戴高乐和印度总理尼赫鲁，表示苏联政府同意在联合国安全理事会范围内举行政府首脑会议，讨论中近东局势问题。信中说，苏联政府建议会议于7月28日就开始在纽约举行。
    赫鲁晓夫7月19日曾经写信给美、英、法、印四国政府首脑，建议立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、美、英、法、印五国政府首脑会议，以便马上采取措施停止中近东已经开始的军事冲突。上述四国政府首脑于20日和22日分别就这一建议写了复信，赫鲁晓夫昨天的信就是对他们的复信的答复。
    赫鲁晓夫在给美、英、法三国政府首脑的信中说，苏联政府认为，现在世界和平受到的威胁极其严重，必须采取一切可能的最紧急的措施来防止发生世界冲突。我们不能缩小这种冲突的危险性，因为现在有人主张扩大在中东的侵略区，而且首先在策划对伊拉克的军事进攻。正因为这样，苏联才建议立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的五国政府首脑会议。我们满意地获悉，苏联的建议得到了美国总统的积极反应。英国首相，法国总理和印度总理也表示愿意举行这种会议，我们谨对此表示谢意。
    赫鲁晓夫在致美、英、法和印度四国政府首脑的信中说：麦克米伦提出在安全理事会的范围内召开政府首脑会议的意见，我们是可以接受的。苏联政府在7月19日的信里已经指出不应当避开安理会。鉴于必须采取紧急措施来维护和平，我们认为政府首脑会议采取什么形式在这种情况下没有决定性意义。重要的是尽可能早地举行这次会议，以便尽快找到正确的解决办法来维护和巩固和平，安定中近东局面，缓和国际紧张局势。
    我们也同意麦克米伦的建议，安理会这次特别会议不应提出任何不经事先商妥的决议案，而其目的只是达成协议，而不是通过表决来确定分歧。
    苏联政府的出发点是：各国政府首脑为了取得有利于维护和巩固和平的最迅速的建设性的解决办法，将有可能进行不只是通过正式程序的共同协商。
    这些信件强调说，既然当前在安理会要讨论的不是一般的日常问题，而是从维护和平与保障安全的角度看来特别重要的问题，我们认为，在当前的情况下，吸收印度参加安全理事会的工作是有好处的。因为印度是一个亚洲大国，是一个被公认为主张巩固和平的国家。赫鲁晓夫对美、英、法政府首脑说，跟一个实际上并不代表任何人的所谓的常任理事国不同，印度的参加将是真正有益的。我们认为，有必要让印度总理尼赫鲁作为印度代表参加安理会的工作，他已经同意参加政府首脑会议。
    至于苏联，既然英国首相、法国总理、印度总理和美国总统已经同意亲自参加安理会特别会议，那末苏联将由苏联部长会议主席出席这次会议。
    不言而喻，安理会在上述五国政府首脑参加下讨论问题时应吸收有关的阿拉伯国家政府参加。
    苏联政府希望尽快知道这四国政府对召开有政府首脑参加的安理会会议的日期的意见。
    赫鲁晓夫在给艾森豪威尔的信中还谈到他不想去争论那些引起紧张局势和给中近东地区的和平造成威胁的原因。他说，我在7月19日的信里已经谈过了苏联政府对所有这些问题的看法。不过我要坚决否认你在信里提到的那种认为苏联在支持世界上的扩张势力和侵略势力的说法。自从美国对黎巴嫩和英国对约旦实行武装干涉后，如果有谁过去弄不清楚究竟是谁真正在执行威胁和平和各国人民安全的扩张和侵略政策的话，那么现在他不会再有怀疑了。
    赫鲁晓夫在给尼赫鲁的信中还感谢他迅速答复赫鲁晓夫7月19日的信。赫鲁晓夫说，我们还满意地知道了，对近日来中近东局势的看法我们是吻合的，对必须采取紧急措施、通过谈判来消除目前的国际危机的看法也是吻合的。赫鲁晓夫最后表示确信，印度积极参加建议中的会议将有助于停止中近东冲突和防止对普遍和平的威胁。
