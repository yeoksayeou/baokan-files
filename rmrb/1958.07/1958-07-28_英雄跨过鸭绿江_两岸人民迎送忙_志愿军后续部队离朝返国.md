Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 27th: The follow-up units of the second batch of the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea have continued in recent days to board peace and triumphal return trains and head towards the north bank of the Yalu River, amid the warm farewells of the local Korean people and their comrades-in-arms from the Korean People's Army.

Before boarding the trains, officers and soldiers of the various follow-up units of the Chinese People's Volunteers held farewell gatherings with the leading party and government organs at all levels, the people, and the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, exchanging commemorative gifts with each other. Many units also carried out one last round of voluntary labor before returning home, helping the local people repair bridges and roads, mend houses, build pigsties, and carry water and sweep courtyards.

At the farewell gift-giving ceremony on July 24th, officers and soldiers of one unit presented 817 gifts of 52 kinds, including handmade iron rakes, hoes, sickle knives, and iron shovels, to the members of two agricultural cooperatives in the area. Communication soldiers of one unit used old materials to assemble four telephones and set up a 7,000-meter-long telephone line for a certain “Li” and three agricultural cooperatives in the area as a gift. When saying goodbye to the “October 25th Agricultural Cooperative,” which had a deep friendship with the Chinese People's Volunteers, officers and soldiers of one unit built a nursery building with 18 rooms for the members. Engineer soldiers worked day and night to make 15 small beds, 127 toys, and many small stools, small round tables, and small chairs for the children of this nursery.

The officers and soldiers of the follow-up units were deeply welcomed by the local Korean people upon their return to their country. Seok Geum-ju, the mother of the Matrosov-style hero Li Shoufu, ran nearly twenty "li" to hang the gold jewelry she wore at her wedding more than thirty years ago around the neck of Colonel Ma Youli, saying that this was what she had prepared for Shoufu's wedding, and Shoufu had sacrificed gloriously for the country, so you are just like my son. More than twenty elderly women over the age of sixty from the Yongquan Agricultural Cooperative in a certain county steamed rice cakes, made sumptuous meals, and carried them on their heads to the camp of a certain unit to see the officers and soldiers off. That day, they talked with the officers and soldiers until late at night, reluctant to part. Volunteer Army mothers Kim Wen-hua and support-the-front model Shi Ji-rong also invited representatives of the Volunteer Army to their homes to eat a farewell meal and drink farewell wine. Mother Kim hugged each soldier in her arms and fed the soldiers food and wine, saying, "This is the last meal I will cook for you, I wish you a safe journey."

    英雄跨过鸭绿江　两岸人民迎送忙
    志愿军后续部队离朝返国
    新华社平壤27日电　中国人民志愿军第二批撤离朝鲜部队后续部队，连日继续乘和平凯旋列车，在驻地朝鲜人民和人民军战友盛情欢送下驶向鸭绿江北岸。
    志愿军后续部队各部队官兵在登车前都同驻地朝鲜各级党政领导机关、人民群众和人民军官兵分别举行了告别大会，互相赠送了纪念礼品。许多部队并在返国前进行了最后一次帮助驻地人民修桥补路、修补房舍、砌猪圈、挑水扫院等义务劳动。
    某部官兵在7月24日的告别赠礼大会上将亲手制作的铁耙、锄头、链刀、铁铣等五十二种八百一十七件礼物赠给了驻地两个农业社的社员。某部通信兵利用旧材料装配了四个电话机，为驻地某里和三个农业社架设了一条七千多公尺长的电话专线，作为通信兵的赠礼。某部官兵在告别和志愿军有着深厚友谊的“十·二五农业社”时，为社员们建筑了包括十八个房间的托儿所房舍。工兵战士们还日夜不息地为这座托儿所的孩子们制成了十五张小床、一百二十七件玩具和许多小凳、小圆桌、小椅子。
    后续部队官兵们在归国时，受到驻地朝鲜人民的深情欢送。马特洛索夫式的英雄李寿福的母亲石金柱，跑了近二十里路把她三十几年前结婚时的金首饰挂在马友里上校的胸前说，这是我准备为寿福作婚礼的，寿福为祖国光荣牺牲了，你们就和我的儿子一样。某郡龙泉农业社二十多位六十岁以上的老大娘蒸了米糕，作了丰盛的饭菜，用头顶着送到某部驻地，来为官兵们饯行。当天，她们和官兵们依依话别到深夜。志愿军妈妈金温花和支前模范石吉荣，还请志愿军代表来家同吃惜别饭，同饮惜别酒。金妈妈把一个个战士搂在怀里，把酒菜送到战士们嘴里，妈妈说：“这是最后吃妈妈亲手做的一顿饭了，祝孩子们一路平安。”
