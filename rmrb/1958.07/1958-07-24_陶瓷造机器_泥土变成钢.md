Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: A new page has been turned in the history of China's ceramics industry—the successful use of ceramics to replace steel in the manufacture of machinery, equipment, and materials.

Since the Great Leap Forward this year, ceramics factories in Yixing, Jiangsu; Shiwan, Guangdong; Liling, Hunan; Zibo, Shandong; Tangshan, Hebei, and other places have successively used ceramics to manufacture hundreds of types of machinery, equipment, and materials. These machines and materials include various industrial blowers, separators, ball mills, turbine pumps, and agricultural gas generators, water pumps, and so on. The horizontal clay mixing machine made of ceramics by ceramic workers in Shiwan Town, Foshan, Guangdong, has the same usage and clay mixing quality as the steel-made clay mixing machine. It can mix 3,500 jin per hour, and it is estimated that it can be increased to 6,000 jin; while the steel-made clay mixing machine can only mix 1,500 jin of clay per hour. The quality of ceramic motor housings is also very good. When hit with a hammer, the sound is clangorous, like steel. The 14-inch low-pressure ceramic water pump produced in Yixing can rotate 1,000 revolutions per minute, with a lift of 5 meters, and can pump 400 tons of water per hour, which can irrigate 300 mu of land per day and night, with an efficiency no less than that of iron pumps.

Ceramic machines have low cost and price. For example, the ceramic clay mixing machine made in Shiwan only costs about 1,000 yuan per unit (including the engine part), while the steel-made machine costs 3,800 yuan per unit. The price of ceramic motor housings is about four or five yuan each, which is one-tenth of the price of steel motor housings.

Ceramics have the advantages of corrosion resistance, high temperature resistance, pressure resistance, electrical insulation, and oxidation resistance. Ceramic mechanical equipment is particularly suitable for the needs of industrial production such as chemical reactions, high-temperature combustion, and electrical insulation. In this regard, it has performance that steel does not have or is better than steel. At the same time, because of its low price, it is welcomed by industrial departments and the vast number of farmers. In the first half of this year, the Yixing ceramics industry department produced 3.19 million pieces of industrial ceramic machinery and equipment, which were supplied to more than 900 production units in 28 provinces and cities, and still cannot meet the demand.

The successful use of ceramics instead of steel in the manufacture of machinery and equipment will save a large amount of steel for the country. This year alone, Shiwan Town in Guangdong plans to produce 425,000 meters of ceramic tap water pipes, 1,000 water pumps, and 80 clay mixing machines, which can save about 10,000 tons of steel.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 22nd: Ceramic lightweight transport rails that can replace steel rails have been successfully trial-produced, opening up a new road for industrial and mining enterprises and rural areas to realize transportation vehicleization.

The creators of this ceramic rail are the staff of the Ding Shu Town Building Ceramics Factory, the Iron and Wood Industry Production Cooperative, and the Baini Mining Factory in Yixing County, Jiangsu Province. After the successful trial production, a 17.4-meter-long track was immediately laid, and a wooden-wheeled vehicle was loaded with 1,000 kilograms, with six people sitting on it for testing. The wheel vehicle ran back and forth on the track, and no cracks were found in the track. (Attached picture)

### 陶瓷造机器  泥土变成钢

    陶瓷造机器  泥土变成钢
    据新华社23日讯　我国陶瓷工业制造史上揭开了新的一页——用陶瓷代替钢铁制造机器设备和器材成功。
    今年大跃进以来，江苏宜兴、广东石湾、湖南醴陵、山东淄博、河北唐山等地的陶瓷工厂，都相继用陶瓷制造出数百种机器设备和器材。这些机器器材有各种工业用的鼓风机、分离机、球磨机、涡轮泵和农业用的煤气发生炉、抽水机等等。广东佛山石湾镇陶瓷工人用陶瓷制成的卧式炼泥机和钢铁制的炼泥机一样，使用情况和炼泥质量一直很好，每小时能炼三千五百斤，估计还可以提高到六千斤；而钢铁制的炼泥机每小时仅能炼泥一千五百斤。陶制电动机外壳的质量也很好，用锤来敲，响声铿锵，如钢一样。宜兴产的陶质十四寸低压水泵，每分钟可以转一千转，扬程五公尺，每小时可以抽水四百吨，一昼夜可以灌溉三百亩地，效率不低于铁质的。
    陶质机器成本低，价格便宜。例如石湾制的陶制炼泥机每部只要一千元左右（包括发动部分），而用钢铁制造的每部要三千八百元。陶质电动机外壳的价格每个约四、五元左右，为钢铁制的电动机壳售价的十分之一。
    陶瓷具有耐腐蚀、耐高温、耐压、电绝缘、抗氧化等优点，用陶瓷制造的机械器材设备，特别适合于化学反应、高温燃烧、电气绝缘等工业生产的需要，这方面它具有钢铁所不具备或者比钢铁更为良好的性能。同时由于它的价格低廉，因而受到各地工业部门和广大农民的欢迎。宜兴陶瓷工业部门今年上半年生产了三百十九万件工业用陶瓷机械器材，供应了二十八个省市的九百多个生产单位使用，还不能满足需要。
    陶瓷代钢铁制造机械器材成功，将为国家节省大批钢铁。仅广东石湾镇今年就计划生产陶质自来水管四十二万五千公尺，抽水机一千台、炼泥机八十部，合计可以节约钢铁一万吨左右。
    据新华社南京22日电　可以代替钢轨的陶质轻便运输轨道试制成功，为工矿企业和农村实现运输车子化开辟了新的道路。
    创造这种陶轨的是江苏省宜兴县鼎蜀镇建筑陶磁一厂、铁木业生产合作社、白坭采矿厂的职工们。试制成功以后，立即铺设十七点四公尺长的轨道，用木制轮车载重一千公斤，上面坐六个人进行试验。轮车在轨道上来回运行，没有发现轨道有丝毫破裂的现象。（附图片）
