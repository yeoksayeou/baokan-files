Xinhua News Agency, Guilin, 10th: Yulin County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region recently mobilized the masses to vigorously develop meteorological undertakings. Within three days, over 400 meteorological center groups and meteorological groups were established in various townships and communes.

The Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative established a meteorological group in just six hours, formulated a system, and erected signal flagpoles and weather vanes. The next day, the forecast signal flag was raised.

In Wangyao Commune, when the meteorological group was established, an elderly man in his seventies did not believe in weather forecasts. Every time he saw that the forecast was accurate, he was convinced. He voluntarily participated in the work, diligently recorded forecasts in a small notebook every day, and passed them on everywhere. He said: The Communist Party can manage the land and also the sky. This meteorological group also absorbed experienced veteran farmers as members. On the day when the representatives attending the Third National Meteorological Conference came to visit Wangyao Commune, the county meteorological station forecast moderate rain. The veteran farmers of this commune saw that the clouds in the sky were low, dense, and thick, the thunder was low, and the air was stuffy, and they said that it would not only be moderate rain, but heavy rain. After a serious discussion, everyone thought it made sense, immediately contacted the meteorological station to make corrections, and immediately arranged for the whole township to conserve water and prevent waterlogging. Before long, it really rained heavily. Facts prove that the experience of the masses is valuable.

The main task of the meteorological groups established in this county is to listen to the weather forecast every day, discuss and correct it according to the local weather conditions, and then transmit the forecast to each production team. The meteorological groups do not set up a separate organization. The members are all cadres who originally led production, so the activities of the group will not affect production, but are closely integrated with production activities. In addition to regularly collecting mass experience, agricultural proverbs, and farmers' opinions on the use of forecasts, the meteorological groups also explain meteorological knowledge to the masses.

In the great leap forward in agricultural production in Yulin County, the peasant masses actively demanded that production be arranged in a timely manner according to weather changes, and at the same time demanded weather forecasts. In order to meet the needs of the farmers, the county party committee decided to hand over meteorological work to the masses themselves. At the same time, a key experiment on organizing meteorological groups was carried out in Wangyao Agricultural Cooperative in Dongming Township, and the experience was promoted throughout the county.

### 玉林群众大办气象事业  三天内各乡、社建立四百多个气象小组

    玉林群众大办气象事业
    三天内各乡、社建立四百多个气象小组
    新华社桂林10日电　广西僮族自治区玉林县最近发动群众大搞气象事业，三天之内各乡、社共建立了四百多个气象中心小组和气象小组。
    新民农业社只用六小时的时间，就成立了气象小组，制定了制度，竖起了信号旗杆和风向标，第二天预报信号旗就升起来了。
    旺瑶社在成立气象小组时，有一个七十多岁的老人，不信天气预报，每次看到预报很准就信服了。他自动地参加工作，天天拿着一本小本子，认真登记预报，到处去传递。他说：共产党管得了地，也管得了天。这个气象小组还吸收有经验的老农民作为组员。正当参加第三次全国气象会议的代表来到旺瑶社参观的那天，县气象站预报有中雨，这个社的老农民一看天空云低密厚、雷声低沉、空气沉闷，就说不仅是中雨，有大雨。经过认真讨论后，大家认为有道理，立即与气象站联系，进行订正，并马上布置全乡保水防涝工作。没过了多久，真的大雨倾盆。事实证明群众的经验可贵。
    这个县成立的气象小组主要任务是每天收听天气预报，根据本地方天气情况，进行讨论订正，然后把预报传到各生产队。气象小组并不另搞一套机构，组员都是原来领导生产的干部，所以小组的活动不会影响生产，而且和生产活动紧密结合起来。气象小组除经常收集群众经验、农谚和农民使用预报的意见外，还向群众讲解气象知识。
    玉林县在农业生产大跃进中，农民群众积极要求能及时地根据天气变化来安排生产，同时要求搞天气预报。县委会为了满足农民的要求，便决定把气象工作交给群众自己办。同时在东明乡旺瑶农业社作组织气象小组的重点试验，取得经验向全县推广。
