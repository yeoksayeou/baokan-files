Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25th: Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway workers, in their fight against floods, are accelerating construction and have decided to lay the tracks to Xining by April 1st next year.

This summer, Qinghai has transformed from its historically arid state into a region of continuous rain. The Yellow River and its tributaries, the Huangshui and Datong Rivers, have experienced several flood peaks. The workers of the Fourth and Fifth Engineering Sections of the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who are responsible for the construction of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway, have mastered the patterns of the floods through practice; they temporarily retreat when the flood peaks arrive, and then concentrate all their efforts on key projects after the flood peaks subside, raising bridge piers one by one out of the water, breaking the convention that construction cannot be carried out during the flood season. Since construction began in mid-May, more than ten large bridges along the line have begun to take shape. Of the twenty-nine bridge piers in the five bridge projects located in Gansu Province, fifteen have been built out of the water, and the three piers of the Yellow River Bridge are developing upwards. Bridge projects in Qinghai Province are also under construction, and tunnel projects along the entire line are progressing extremely rapidly. The construction of the four-kilometer-long Guanjiao Mountain Pass tunnel, originally scheduled to begin next year, has also been decided to start ahead of schedule in August of this year. Workers from the Engineering Office of the Sixth Engineering Bureau, who had previously excavated the Qinling and Wushaoling tunnels, plan to complete this large tunnel in sixteen months.

    兰青铁路职工战胜洪水加紧施工
    据新华社西宁25日电　兰青铁路职工在和洪水搏斗中加快施工速度，决定在明年4月1日把铁轨铺到西宁。
    今年入夏以来，青海一变历年来的干旱面貌，阴雨连绵。黄河及其支流湟水、大通河已经出现好几次洪峰。担负兰青铁路修建任务的铁道部第六工程局第四和第五工程段的职工们，在实践中掌握了洪水的规律；在洪峰到来时暂时撤退，洪峰消失后集中全力重点突击，把一个个桥墩抢出水面，打破了洪水季节不能施工的惯例。从5月中旬开工以来，沿线十多座大桥已经初具规模。位于甘肃省境内的五座桥梁工程的二十九个桥墩，已有十五个筑出水面，其中黄河大桥的三个桥墩正在向高处发展。青海境内的桥梁工程也在加紧施工，全线隧道工程进展极为迅速。原订明年动工的全长四公里的关角垭口大隧道，也决定提前在今年8月份开工，曾经开凿秦岭和乌鞘岭隧道的第六工程局工程处职工计划以十六个月的时间打通这个大隧道。
