Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 19th. Hong Kong public organizations and newspapers are strongly condemning the armed aggression by US and British imperialism.

Chen Pishi, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, told Xinhua News Agency yesterday that the United States' armed intervention in Lebanon and Britain's following of the United States' armed intervention policy by sending troops into Jordan are both naked acts of imperialist aggression, and therefore they are bound to be opposed by peace-loving countries and peoples around the world.

Su Chongming, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Clerks Association, said that the United States' armed intervention in Lebanon not only violated the United Nations Charter but also threatened world peace. If the US and British imperialists do not immediately stop this crazy and adventurous action, they will inevitably be burned to a frazzle by the raging fire of the Arab national liberation movement.

Yesterday's editorial in Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" pointed out that the American aggressors, in the face of the surging tide of opposition from people all over the world against the United States' armed intervention in the Middle East, are not only deeply besieged but have also begun to embark on the road to failure. Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" wrote in yesterday's editorial entitled "Don't Let the United States Start a Fire": The Arab people's determination to defend and strive for national independence is not to be humiliated. The American aggressors face two futures: either withdraw as soon as possible or set themselves on fire.

    阿拉伯人民不可侮
    香港公众团体和报纸谴责美英侵略
    新华社香港19日电　香港公众团体和报纸舆论强烈谴责美英帝国主义的武装侵略行为。
    香港华人革新协会主席陈丕士昨天对新华社记者说，美国武装干涉黎巴嫩和英国追随美国的武装干涉政策进兵约旦，都是赤裸裸的帝国主义侵略行为，因此它必然遭到全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的反对。
    香港华人文员协会主席苏重明说，美国武装干涉黎巴嫩，不但破坏了联合国宪章，还威胁着世界和平。如果美英帝国主义不立即停止这种疯狂的冒险行动，必然会被阿拉伯民族解放运动的怒火烧得焦头烂额。
    香港“文汇报”昨天的社论指出，美国侵略者在全世界人民反对美国武装干涉中东的汹涌浪潮中，不但已身陷重围，而且已经开始走上失败的道路。香港“大公报”昨天在题为“不许美国放火”的社论中写道：阿拉伯人民保卫和争取民族独立的决心是不可侮的。美国侵略者面临两个前途，要么趁早抽身，要么放火自焚。
