Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, July 17th: The execution of Mongolia's national economic plan for the first half of this year demonstrates that Mongolia's economic and cultural construction has further developed.

The Mongolian Statistics Bureau recently released a communiqué on the execution of the 1958 national economic plan for the first half of the year, announcing that 6.3 million head of various young livestock survived in Mongolia this year, with a survival rate of 94.3%. With the exception of a few provinces, the livestock mortality rate in most regions has decreased compared to last year, which is of great significance for ensuring the completion of this year's livestock production increase plan.

In agriculture, the country's sown area reached more than 107,000 hectares, an expansion of 30.4% compared to last year. Thanks to Soviet economic and technical assistance, the number of tractors, cultivators, and transport trucks at state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms has greatly increased this year, playing a significant role in completing this year's spring plowing production tasks.

Mongolia's agricultural and pastoral collectivization movement is developing actively and steadily. Since September 1957, more than 100 new cooperatives have been established nationwide, and more than 70 cooperatives have been merged. Currently, there are 674 cooperatives nationwide. By June of this year, it is estimated that more than 80,000 herding households have joined cooperatives, accounting for 42.4% of the total number of herding households nationwide.

To help the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, the state provided cooperatives and individual herdsmen with a total of 6.8 million tugriks in loans in the first half of this year, an increase of 16% compared to the same period in 1957.

Mongolia's industrial production plan for the first half of 1958 was completed by 103.7%, and the output of many industrial products increased compared to the same period last year. For example, electricity increased by 15%, felt by 26.3%, leather by 9.8%, and bricks by 4.6%.

The confectionery factory newly built with Soviet assistance and a brick and tile factory provided by China as gratuitous aid also went into production in the first half of this year.

Mongolia's transportation volume and capital construction have increased to varying degrees compared to the first half of last year. For example, railway freight volume increased by 1.7%, passenger volume increased by 12.1%; the investment in capital construction in the first half of the year was 82.5 million tugriks, greatly exceeding the figure for the same period last year, and the completed workload of capital construction also increased by 48.2% compared to the same period last year. Currently, residential and other buildings are being constructed in the Mongolian capital and the capitals of various provinces.

The total retail sales of commodities in the first half of this year increased by 11% compared to the same period last year.

The number of ordinary schools, vocational schools, and universities increased in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. This year, 760 students graduated from universities, an increase of 14% compared to last year.

The number of hospital beds in Mongolia has also increased, with maternity hospital beds alone increasing by 36%.

    蒙古胜利完成上半年经济计划
    经济文化建设欣欣向荣
    新华社乌兰巴托17日电　蒙古人民共和国今年上半年国民经济计划的执行情况表明，蒙古的经济和文化建设有了进一步的发展。
    蒙古统计局最近发表的1958年上半年国民经济计划执行情况的公报宣布，蒙古今年成活的各种幼畜达到六百三十万头，成活率为94.3％。除了少数省份以外，大多数地区的牲畜死亡率都比去年降低了，这对保证完成今年的牲畜增产计划有很大意义。
    在农业方面，全国的播种面积达到十万七千多公顷，比去年扩大了30.4％。由于苏联在经济和技术方面的援助，今年国营农牧场的拖拉机、松土机和运输卡车的数量都大大得到增加，对于完成今年的春耕生产任务起了很大作用。
    蒙古的农牧业合作化运动正在积极而稳步地向前发展。从1957年9月起，全国新建了一百多个合作社，有七十多个社进行了合并。目前，全国共有六百七十四个合作社。到今年6月，估计全国已经有八万多户牧民入了社，占全国牧户总数的42.4％。
    为了帮助农牧业的发展，国家在今年上半年共贷给合作社和个体牧民总额达六百八十万图格里克的贷款，比1957年同期增加了16％。
    蒙古1958年上半年的工业生产计划完成了103.7％，有许多工业产品的产量都比去年同期提高了。例如，电力增加了15％、毡子增加了26.3％、皮革增加了9.8％、砖增加了4.6％。
    苏联帮助新建的糖果点心工厂和中国无偿援助的一个砖瓦厂也在今年上半年投入生产。
    蒙古的交通运输量和基本建设都比去年上半年有不同程度的增长。例如，铁路的货运量增加了1.7％、客运量增加了12.1％；上半年的基本建设投资额为八千二百五十万图格里克，大大超过了去年同期的数字，已经完成的基本建设的工作量也比去年同期增加了48.2％。目前，蒙古首都和各省省会都在建设住宅和其他建筑物。
    今年上半年的商品零售额比去年同期增加了11％。
    普通学校、专科学校和高等学校今年上半年比去年同期都有了增加。今年高等学校的毕业生达七百六十名，比去年增加了14％。
    蒙古全国医院的床位也有了增加，只是产妇科医院的床位就增加了36％。
