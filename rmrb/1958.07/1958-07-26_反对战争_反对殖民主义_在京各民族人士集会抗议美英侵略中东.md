Xinhua News Agency, July 25th—Prominent figures from all nationalities in Beijing held a gathering today, strongly protesting the crimes of U.S. and British imperialism in their aggression against the Middle East. At the symposium, they unanimously pointed out that the closely united people of all nationalities in China firmly uphold national equality and oppose national oppression; firmly uphold peace and oppose war, and fully support the just struggle of the Arab people for national independence.

	Lu Han (Yi nationality) said: The people of the Middle East have awakened, and they will never allow the imperialist colonial policies and war policies to run rampant everywhere. The power of the people is irresistible. If imperialism dares to launch a war madly, it is destined to accelerate its demise, and victory will surely belong to justice and the people.

	Lao She (Manchu nationality), who came to participate in the symposium despite being ill, said: The actions of U.S. and British imperialism in invading the Middle East have made people see more clearly the law of imperialism's self-destruction. Now the wind of revolution is getting stronger and stronger, the people of the Middle East have stood up, and the people of Africa have stood up. If imperialism wants to launch a war, there will definitely be more nationally independent countries. Our Chinese nationalities are united like brothers, resolutely supporting the just struggle of the people of the Middle East.

	Dingjia Duoji Gicun (Tibetan nationality), Director of the Dalai's Office in Beijing, and Suonge Baton (Tibetan nationality), Director of the Panchen's Office in Beijing, pointed out in their speeches that the Tibetan people, who have suffered from the oppression and enslavement of U.S. and British imperialism, have long been familiar with the ugly faces of imperialism. There is a Tibetan proverb that says: A donkey wearing a tiger's skin is not scary. If they launch a war, we will resolutely eliminate them. Dingjia Duoji Gicun and Suonge Baton also pointed out that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Tibetan people have driven away the imperialist forces, but we must always be vigilant against the imperialists' conspiracies against Tibet.

	At the meeting, Zai Tao (Manchu nationality), Heng Sheng (Mongolian nationality), Du Guanwu (Hui nationality), Huang Guangxue (Korean nationality), Ma Dalin (Yi nationality), and Xie Nanguang, He Guiyan, and Mei Gongbin (Han nationality) also spoke. They unanimously stated that they resolutely demand that the U.S. and British aggressor troops immediately get out of the Middle East, and warned the U.S. and British aggressors that if they dare to play with fire, the people of all nationalities in China will never stand idly by.

    在京各民族人士集会抗议美英侵略中东
    新华社25日讯　在北京的各民族著名人士今天举行集会，强烈抗议美英帝国主义侵略中东的罪行。他们在座谈会上一致指出：紧密团结的中国各民族人民，坚决主张民族平等，反对民族压迫；坚决主张和平，反对战争，全力支持阿拉伯人民争取民族独立的正义斗争。
    卢汉（彝族）说：中东人民已经觉醒了，他们决不容许帝国主义的殖民政策和战争政策到处泛滥。人民的力量是不可抗拒的，如果帝国主义敢于疯狂地发动战争，那就注定要加速灭亡，胜利一定属于正义和人民的。
    带病赶来参加座谈会的老舍（满族）说：美英帝国主义侵略中东的行动，使人更加看清了帝国主义自趋灭亡的规律。现在革命的风越来越大，中东人民站起来了，非洲人民站起来了，帝国主义如果要发动战争，那就一定会出现更多的民族独立的国家。我们中国各民族团结得像亲兄弟一样，坚决地支持中东人民的正义斗争。
    达赖驻京办事处处长定甲·多吉吉村（藏族）和班禅驻京办事处处长孙格巴顿（藏族）在发言中指出：受过美英帝国主义压迫和奴役的西藏人民，早就熟悉帝国主义的丑恶嘴脸。西藏有句谚语说：驴子披着老虎皮来，并不可怕。它们如果发动战争，就坚决消灭它们。定甲·多吉吉村和孙格巴顿还指出：西藏人民在中国共产党的领导下，赶走了帝国主义势力，但是，我们必须时刻警惕帝国主义对西藏的阴谋活动。
    会上，载涛（满族）、恒升（蒙古族）、杜冠武（回族）、黄光学（朝鲜族）、马大林（彝族）和谢南光、贺贵严、梅龚彬（汉族）等人都发了言。他们一致表示：坚决要求美英侵略军立即从中东滚出去，并警告美英侵略者如果胆敢玩火，中国各民族人民绝不会袖手旁观。
