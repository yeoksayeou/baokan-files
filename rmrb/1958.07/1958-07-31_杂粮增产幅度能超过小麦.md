The summer harvest this year has been an unprecedented bumper harvest. High-yield models of wheat, rapeseed, and other crops, which were once considered low-yield crops, have emerged in large numbers; good news of early rice bumper harvests continues to pour in, and high-yield records have already surpassed wheat.

However, can millet, sorghum, corn, etc., which account for more than 40% of China's grain crop area, leap forward? This has indeed become an important key to whether grain production can increase at a high speed this year.

Corn has always been considered "ironclad crops," known for its high yield, stable yield, and large potential for increased production. In the past few years, the national average yield or high-yield models have greatly exceeded wheat: in 1957, the national average wheat yield was 114 jin per mu, while corn was 190 jin; the highest wheat yield record was 1,540 jin, while corn was 2,520 jin. This year, since wheat can take the lead and increase production by 68%, corn has much greater potential for increasing production than wheat, and of course it can reach a new level.

The yield of millet and sorghum has always been higher than that of wheat. From the characteristics of the crops, millet has strong drought resistance, and sorghum is not only drought-resistant but also waterlogging-resistant; from the growth characteristics, its potential for increased production is very large, and various conditions are superior to wheat. Many superior conditions are originally a good thing, but some people have developed a blindly optimistic attitude because of this. They think that wheat can still leap forward, and millet and sorghum are even less of a problem, so they have relaxed their efforts. In fact, the increase in the yield of all crops depends on human efforts. Paralysis and carelessness, and relaxation of field management, will only bring great harm to this year's grain production. If millet and sorghum cannot leap forward, it will drag down the overall yield and affect this year's grain production increase.

Millet and sorghum are closely related to the lives of farmers in vast areas. Millet and sorghum rice are the staple food in many areas, millet grass is a good fodder for mules and horses, and sorghum stalks are used as fuel as well as raw materials for rural construction and handicraft sideline industries. To despise millet, sorghum and other crops, and not actively lead the masses to strive for millet and sorghum harvest, is to not care about the lives of the masses, and to lack a mass viewpoint.

Can millet and sorghum leap forward? According to past and present facts, the answer is yes. Lingyuan County, Liaoning Province, is a dry and barren place, and in 1957 millet achieved a great harvest. The United Agricultural Cooperative in the county produced an average of 612 jin of millet per mu on 229 mu of land. The Dongsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Funing County, Hebei Province, produced an average of 734 jin of sorghum per mu on 1,993 mu of land, and 33 mu of multi-spike sorghum reached 1,302 jin per mu. The main reason why these places were able to obtain high-yield harvests was that they attached importance to various cultivation and management practices for millet and sorghum: they carried out deep plowing, meticulous land preparation, applied more base fertilizer and timely topdressing, and strengthened mid-tillage weeding and irrigation.

The conditions for this year's leap in production of coarse grains are much better than those for wheat. Last year, wheat was sown before the arrival of the Great Leap Forward situation, and various preparations such as deep plowing and base fertilizer were not very good. This year's wheat harvest mainly relied on strengthening later field management, while millet, sorghum, corn, etc., were sown under the situation of the national rural leap forward, with great achievements in water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and soil improvement. These many favorable conditions have laid a good foundation for the harvest of millet, sorghum, and corn. This year, the sowing of coarse grain crops in most areas has been earlier, faster, and better than in the past, and the base fertilizer is sufficient. If we add more effort in field management, there is no doubt that we can achieve a greater increase in production than wheat.

    杂粮增产幅度能超过小麦
    马矍翁
    今年夏收作物空前丰收，一向被认为低产作物的小麦、油菜等丰产典型大量涌现；早稻丰收喜讯不断传来，高额丰产纪录已经超过了小麦。
    但是在我国粮食作物面积中占40％以上的谷子、高粱、玉米等，能不能跃进，确已成为今年粮食产量能不能高速度增产的一个重要关键。
    玉米一向被认为是“铁杆庄稼”，是以产量高、产量稳定、增产潜力大而著称的高产作物。过去几年来的全国平均产量或高额丰产典型，都大大超过小麦：1957年全国小麦平均亩产量为一百一十四斤，而玉米是一百九十斤；小麦最高丰产纪录是一千五百四十斤，而玉米是二千五百二十斤。今年小麦既能一马当先，增产68％，玉米比小麦增产的潜力大得多，当然可以更上一层楼。
    谷子、高粱的产量历年都比小麦高。从作物的特点来看，谷子小抗旱能力很强，高粱不但抗旱又能抗涝；从生长性状上来看它的增产潜力很大，各种条件都比小麦优越。优越条件多，本来是好事情，有些人却由此产生了盲目乐观情绪，他们认为小麦还能跃进，谷子、高粱更没问题了，因此放松了努力。其实一切作物产量的增加，是决定于人为的努力。麻痹大意，放松田间管理，只会给今年粮食生产带来很大危害。如果谷子、高粱不能跃进，就会拖住总产量的后腿，影响今年粮食的增产。
    谷子、高粱在广大地区与农民生活有密切关系。小米、高粱米是不少地区的主粮，谷草是骡马的良好饲草，高粱秆除作燃料外还是农村建筑用材和手工业副业的原料。轻视谷子、高粱等作物，不积极领导群众争取谷子、高粱丰收，就是不关心群众生活，就是缺乏群众观点。
    谷子、高粱能不能跃进呢？根据过去和现在的事实，回答都是肯定的。辽宁省凌源县是个干旱瘠薄的地方，1957年谷子获得大丰收。该县的联合农业社二百二十九亩谷子平均每亩产六百一十二斤。河北省抚宁县东升农业社一千九百九十三亩高粱，平均亩产七百三十四斤，有三十三亩多穗高粱亩产达到一千三百零二斤。这些地方所以能够获得高额丰产，主要原因是重视对谷子、高粱的各种栽培管理：进行了深耕，精细整地，多施基肥和适时追肥，加强了中耕锄草和灌溉。
    今年杂粮作物跃进增产的条件，要比小麦好得多。去年小麦是在大跃进的形势到来以前播种的，各种准备工作如深耕、基肥等等方面都不太好，今年小麦的丰收主要是靠加强了后期的田间管理，而谷子、高粱、玉米等，则是在全国农村跃进形势下，水利建设和积肥、改良土壤等等方面已获巨大成绩的情况下播种的。这许多有利条件，为谷子、高粱、玉米的丰收打下了良好的基础。今年大部地区的杂粮作物播种都比过去早、快、好，基肥足，如果在田间管理上再加一把劲，毫无疑问，一定可以取得比小麦更大幅度的增产。
