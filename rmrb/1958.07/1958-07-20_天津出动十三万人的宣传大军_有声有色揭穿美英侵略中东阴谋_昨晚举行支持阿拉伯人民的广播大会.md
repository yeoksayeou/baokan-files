    Tianjin Mobilizes 130,000-Strong Propaganda Force
    Vividly Exposes US-British Conspiracy to Invade the Middle East
    Broadcast Rally in Support of Arab People Held Last Night

    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, July 19th) Last night, Tianjin mobilized a propaganda force of 130,000 people to launch a large-scale publicity campaign throughout the city in support of the Arab people's just struggle and against the US-British imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan. All major streets in the city were packed with people, and songs rose and fell. A total of 1.11 million people heard propaganda reports and watched performances that evening.
    The propaganda force included colorful propaganda vehicles, parades carrying map models, cartoons, and costumed performances, temporary propaganda platforms, and reporters traveling through the streets. They vividly expressed the great significance of the Iraqi and Lebanese people's struggle for national independence through newly choreographed songs, ballads, live plays, shadow plays, slideshows, clapper talks, cross-talks, and other artistic performance forms, and vividly exposed the aggressive conspiracy of US-British imperialism's armed intervention in the Arab people's uprising.
    Shen Yawei, a composer from the Central Conservatory of Music, and more than 40 others, carried musical instruments and waved batons in the streets, teaching these new songs to the citizens. When they sang through loudspeakers, "The flames of anger are burning in the Middle East, the Chinese people are roaring, opposing US imperialism's aggression against Lebanon, resolutely defending world peace, American soldiers get out of the Middle East," millions of people standing in the streets learning to sing also sang loudly in unison.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 19th) At the broadcast rally held in Tianjin tonight in support of the Arab people against the US-British imperialist aggressors, workers, peasants, PLA soldiers, writers, students, housewives, Young Pioneers, medical personnel, commercial workers, Muslims, and others angrily warned the US-British imperialists that they must immediately get out of the Middle East.
    Sun Shifeng, a worker at the Tianjin Steel Plant, said that we steelworkers are determined to shorten steelmaking time and produce more steel, and take practical actions to catch up with Britain faster to strengthen the forces defending world peace. Li Zhenguo, who won the title of Special Class Hero in the Korean War, warned the US-British aggressors that we are old acquaintances. In Korea, you were defeated by us. If you dare not withdraw your troops from Lebanon and Jordan, you will inevitably be beaten black and blue as you were in Korea.

    During the broadcast rally, writer Zhang Xuexin rushed to the meeting and read his two new works, "Salute to Iraq" and "Mad Dog".

    天津出动十三万人的宣传大军
    有声有色揭穿美英侵略中东阴谋
    昨晚举行支持阿拉伯人民的广播大会
    本报天津19日讯　天津市昨晚出动了由十三万人组成的宣传大军，向全市人民展开大规模的声援阿拉伯人民的正义斗争、反对美英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的宣传活动。全市各主要街头，人山人海，歌声起伏。当晚听到宣传报告和观看表演的共有一百一十一万人。
    宣传大军中有五彩缤纷的宣传车，有抬着地图模型漫画和化装表演的游行队伍，有临时搭起的宣传台，有穿街越巷的报告员，他们通过新编排的歌曲、曲艺、活报剧、洋片、幻灯、快板、相声等文艺表演形式，通俗地表达了伊拉克和黎巴嫩两国人民争取民族独立斗争的重大意义，并且有声有色地揭穿了美英帝国主义武装干涉阿拉伯人民起义的侵略阴谋。
    中央音乐学院的作曲家沈亚威等四十多人，携带着乐器在街头挥舞着指挥棒，把这些新歌曲教给市民。当他们通过扩音器唱出“愤怒的火焰在中东燃烧，中国人民正发出怒吼，反对美帝侵略黎巴嫩，坚决保卫世界和平，美国兵从中东滚出去”的时候，站在街头学唱的千百万群众，也一齐跟着高声合唱。
    据新华社天津19日电　天津市今晚举行的支持阿拉伯人民反对美英帝国主义侵略者的广播大会上，工人、农民、解放军战士、作家、学生、家庭妇女、少先队员及医务人员、商业工作者、穆斯林等愤怒地警告美英帝国主义者，必须立即从中东滚出去。
    天津钢厂工人孙士凤说，我们炼钢工人决以缩短炼钢时间多出钢，更快地赶上英国的实际行动来加强保卫世界和平的力量。曾经在朝鲜战场获得特等功臣称号的李振国警告美英侵略者说，说起来我们是老相识了，在朝鲜你们是我们手下的败将，如果你们胆敢不从黎巴嫩约旦撤兵，必然会像在朝鲜一样被打得鼻青脸肿。
    在广播大会进行中，作家张学新赶到大会朗读了他的两首新作“向伊拉克致敬”和“疯狗”。
