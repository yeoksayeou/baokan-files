    Where Does Geology Come From?
    Shigong
    Under the illumination of the General Line, the people of the whole country are advancing towards nature with overwhelming force, declaring war on the earth!
    "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated." At this time, it is beneficial to understand some geological knowledge. Because geology is a science that studies the earth. It studies the composition, structure, and history of the earth. However, due to limitations in technology, current research is mainly limited to areas ten to twenty kilometers underground. At the same time, the study of today's oceans, biology, and atmosphere are separate specialized disciplines, not within the scope of geology. But the history of oceans, biology, and climate on earth must be studied by geology. Our ultimate goal in studying all of this is for production, and geology has developed precisely in production. Comrades with practical experience in production can enrich and develop geological science. We only need to look at where geology comes from to understand it better.
    Speaking of geology, it is easy to feel a sense of mystery. To know what is underground from what is on the ground, to find minerals, and to turn barren mountains into mountains of treasure – isn’t this a bit of "supernatural power"? Therefore, some people feel that geology is only for experts. In fact, it's not mysterious at all, and you may already have a lot of geological knowledge without even knowing it.
    Geology has only become a modern science in the last two hundred years, but the use of underground resources by mankind can be traced back thousands of years. In China, during the Zhou Dynasty, minerals such as gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, and mercury were already being mined, and the court had a position called "mineral man". In production, the working people accumulated a great deal of geological knowledge and explored the laws of prospecting. Many of these are recorded in the book "Guanzi," such as "where there is ochre above, there is iron below," which is very much in accordance with geological principles. It can be seen that our country had very rich geological knowledge in the Spring and Autumn period. In the thousands of years that followed, our ancestors discovered and mined countless minerals, and there was not a single "geological expert" at that time. In water conservancy projects, due to the needs of agriculture, China knew how to use groundwater very early on. Particularly worth mentioning is that around 246 BC, the Qin state built the "Zheng Guo Canal," which was more than three hundred li long, in Shaanxi. This canal not only irrigated more than two million mu of farmland, but also drained groundwater, lowering the water table and thus improving most of the saline-alkali land. China was also the first country in the world to drill deep wells. Sichuan, because it was far from the sea, obtained natural gas while drilling for salt.
    Drilling wells, mining, opening canals, and building canals all require solving many geological problems. The working people of our country have already completed these tasks brilliantly, which shows that geology is not mysterious. Geology is simply the systematization of knowledge gained from production. It is only because the development of production has provided a large amount of experience on the one hand, and raised the need for further research in geology on the other hand, that geology has emerged.
    In the Soviet Union, the development of mining was also very early. In the 13th to 16th centuries, there were specialized prospectors. Especially in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, during the reign of Peter the Great, the mining industry further developed, geological theory gradually sprouted, and the Academy of Sciences also published journals with geological papers. In Europe, it can be seen from the German founder of geology, Werner, that geology comes from production practice. Werner's ancestors had been engaged in the iron industry for three hundred years, and at the time of Werner's birth, the mining industry became particularly important. In this environment, he was the first to teach geology, a new subject, in Germany. As for Smith, the father of British geology, he was originally the son of a farmer and only attended village school. His geological theories were mainly accumulated during his work on canal construction. The excavation of the canal provided him with a large amount of rocks and fossils, enabling him to put forward scientific theories on stratigraphic problems.
    It can be seen from these examples that geology was not created by the "genius" of "experts," but is the accumulation of knowledge gained by the working people in production. The masses are the true creators of geology, and this science is not mysterious. Even today, many working people in our country have geological knowledge that some experts do not yet possess. For example, in Jiangxi, some stratigraphic problems take geologists a long time to identify, but some old miners know it by touching it with their hands and can determine whether there is coal below this layer. Therefore, not only should the masses learn geological knowledge to facilitate the whole people in running industries and geology, but experts should also learn from the working people to make geology better serve production.

    地质学从哪里来？
    石工
    在总路线的照耀下，全国人民正以排山倒海之势向自然进军、向地球开战！
    “知己知彼、百战百胜。”在这个时候，了解一些地质学知识是有好处的。因为地质学正是一门研究地球的科学。它研究地球的成分、构造和历史。不过由于技术水平的限制，目前主要限于研究地下十到二十公里的地方。同时对今天的海洋、生物、大气的研究都另有专门学科，不在地质学的范围。但是地球历史上的海洋、生物和气候等问题，还得由地质学来研究。我们研究这一切的最终目的是为了生产，而地质学也正是在生产中发展起来的。具有生产实践经验的同志都可以来丰富发展地质科学。我们只要看一看地质学从哪里来，就可以更加明白。
    谈到地质学，很容易使人感到神秘。地上能知地下事，找出矿产，把荒山变成宝山，这不真是有点“神通”么？因此有的人便觉得搞地质只能是专家的事。其实说穿了一点也不神秘，也许你已经掌握了不少地质知识自己还不知道。
    地质学成为一门近代的科学，不过是近二百年的事，可是人类对地下资源的利用，可以查考出来的已有几千年的历史。我国在周朝时，金、银、铜、铁、铅、锡、汞等矿产已有开采，朝廷中并设有
  “矿人”的职位。在生产中，劳动人民积累了许多地质知识，摸索出找矿的规律。在“管子”一书中记载了不少，其中像“上有赭者，其下有铁”，是很合乎地质学原理的。可见我国在春秋时代，就有很丰富的地质知识了。以后几千年，我们的祖先发现和开采了无数的矿产，那时可是一个“地质专家”也没有呢。在水利工程上，由于农业的需要，我国很早就知道利用地下水。特别值得提出的，是约在公元前二百四十六年，秦国在陕西修建了三百余里长的“郑国渠”。这条渠不仅能灌田二百多万亩，还使地下水得到宣泄，降低了地下水位，因而改良了大部分盐碱地。我国还是世界上最早钻凿深井的国家，四川因离海远，在钻井取盐的同时，还得到了天然气。
    钻井、采矿、开渠、修运河，都需要解决许多地质问题，我国劳动人民早已出色地完成了这些任务，可见地质并不神秘。地质学不过是把这些从生产中得到的知识系统化罢了。只是因为生产的发展，一方面提供了大量的经验，一方面也提出了进一步研究地质学的要求，才有地质学的出现。
    在苏联，采矿事业的发展也很早，在十三——十六世纪就有了专门找矿的人。特别在十七世纪末十八世纪初彼得大帝时期，矿业进一步发达，地质理论逐渐萌芽，科学院也出版刊载地质论文的杂志了。在欧洲，从德国地质学的奠基人魏尔纳的身上也可以看出地质学是从生产实践而来。魏尔纳的祖先从事铁业已有三百年，在魏尔纳出世的时候，采矿事业更变得特别重要了。他在这种环境下，第一个在德国讲授了地质学这门新课。至于称为英国地质学之父的施密斯，本来是一个农民的儿子，只念过村塾，他的地质理论主要是在他担任修建运河的工程时积累下来的。运河的开凿，供给他以大量的岩石和化石，使他在地层问题上提出了科学的理论。
    从这几个例子可以看出，地质学不是“专家”的“天才”创造的，而是劳动人民在生产中所得知识的积累。群众才是地质学的真正创造者，这门科学，没有什么神秘。就是在今天，我国许多劳动人民有的地质知识，有些专家还没有。比如在江西，有的地层分层问题，地质人员搞很久才能识别，可是有的老矿工，用手一摸就知道了，可以断定出这一层下面有没有煤。因此，不仅是群众要学习地质知识，以便于全民办工业、全民办地质；专家也应该向劳动人民学习，使地质学更好地为生产服务。
