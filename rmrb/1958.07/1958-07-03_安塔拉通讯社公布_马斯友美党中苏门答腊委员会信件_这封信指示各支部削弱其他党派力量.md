Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 1st. Antara News Agency published on June 30th a letter from the Central Sumatra Committee of the Masyumi Party to its various branches in Central Sumatra. The letter was signed by Samad, Chairman of the Central Sumatra Committee of the Masyumi Party, and Mansur, the Secretary-General. The letter was dated May 20th, at a time when the Indonesian government forces had already controlled all the important cities of West Sumatra.

The letter stated that the current "guerrilla warfare" (referring to the military activities of the rebel group) was not yet ripe and that it was necessary to wait for an opportunity to "organize forces and formulate appropriate strategies with the help of external forces."

The letter stated that in conducting "guerrilla warfare," "moderate elements" among the "enemies" should be "pulled over" to strike at the "main enemies of the anti-Allah group." To this end, it was necessary to send a large number of Masyumi party members into the various parties of the "enemy."

The letter stated that they should implement strong policies against the Indonesian Communist Party and "eradicate Indonesian Communist Party members from the land of Indonesia."

The letter stated, "Discord should be created among pro-government leaders, causing them to compete for power in order to weaken their strength." The letter concluded by calling on the followers of the Masyumi Party to carry out activities in cities controlled by government forces and in government agencies.

    安塔拉通讯社公布
    马斯友美党中苏门答腊委员会信件
    这封信指示各支部削弱其他党派力量
    据新华社雅加达1日电　安塔拉通讯社在6月30日发表了马斯友美党中苏门答腊委员会写给这个党的中苏门答腊各支部的一封信，这封信是由马斯友美党中苏门答腊委员会主席沙马德和秘书长曼苏尔签署的。写这封信的日期是5月20日，那时候印度尼西亚政府军已经控制了西苏门答腊所有的重要城市。
    这封信说，目前进行着的“游击战”（按指叛乱集团的军事活动）时机还不成熟，还要等待机会去“组织力量，并且在外力的帮助下拟定适当的战略”。
    信中说，在进行“游击战”的时候，应当把“敌人”当中的“温和分子拉过来”，而去打击“反真主集团的主要敌人”。为此，有必要派遣大批马斯友美党党员打入“敌方”各党派。
    这封信说，他们还要对印度尼西亚共产党实行强力政策，并且要“从印度尼西亚的土地上铲除印度尼西亚共产党党员”。
    这封信说，“应当在亲政府的领袖之间制造不和，使他们争夺权位，以便削弱他们的力量”。这封信最后号召马斯友美党的追随者在政府军控制的城市中以及政府机关中展开活动。
