Ramie seed propagation has long been adopted by Chinese farmers. It was recorded as early as in the book "Nongsang Jiyao" (1273). Until now, farmers in ramie producing areas such as Yichun in Jiangxi, Pingle in Guangxi, Lechang in Guangdong, Luxian in Sichuan, and Yongxing in Hunan still use this method and have rich experience in cultivation. However, due to the small scale of ramie planting in the past under the individual economy, root propagation was mostly used, so seed propagation has not been widely promoted. But at present, the area of ramie is rapidly expanding, and root propagation can no longer keep up with the needs of production development. Digging one mu of old ramie field can only expand to at most ten mu; and transportation is inconvenient. Digging too much affects the current year's output of ramie, especially in newly developed areas and ramie areas with insufficient roots, this method cannot be adopted. If seed propagation is used, selecting ten catties of seeds from one mu of old ramie field for seedling cultivation can supply 320 mu of ramie field, which is more than 30 times that of root propagation.

Since 1952, Hunan, Guangdong and other provinces have been promoting seed propagation and have achieved success. In recent years, the area expanded by seed propagation in Hunan Province has reached 40,000 mu, and in Lechang County of Guangdong Province alone, it has reached more than 22,000 mu, and in Dazhou of Sichuan, it has reached more than 15,000 mu.

Generally, new ramie can harvest 30 to 40 catties of seeds per mu in the same year, and well-managed ones can harvest 100 catties. The masses reflect that ramie seed propagation is a good way to spend less money, grow well, expand quickly, and transport easily. Therefore, in the future expansion of ramie area, in addition to adopting propagation methods such as division of roots, division of plants, and layering according to specific conditions, seed propagation methods must be actively adopted.

Some people believe that ramie seed propagation has the disadvantages of low germination rate and survival rate, more variation, and thin bast fiber, and they dare not boldly promote it. This is because they have not realized that ramie seed propagation and seedling cultivation is a highly technical and relatively complicated and meticulous work. As long as the following key points are grasped on the basis of selecting a good seedbed, carefully preparing the land, and applying sufficient base fertilizer, the above shortcomings can be overcome.

(1) Establish seed retention plots and select superior seeds: Ramie is a cross-pollinated crop. In order to avoid hybridization between varieties, seed retention plots should be established to isolate varieties; if seed retention plots are not established, seeds should be retained in the existing ramie fields, and strict removal of impurities and inferior plants must be carried out to ensure the purity of the seeds. The seed retention ramie should be selected from superior varieties, the standards of which are high yield, thick bark, good quality, drought resistance, and wind resistance in the local area.

(2) Sow early and manage diligently: Early sowing can lead to early transplanting, which is the key to striving for more ramie harvests in the same year. Generally, sowing is advisable from Awakening of Insects to the Spring Equinox. After sowing, do a good job of covering to preserve seedlings. After uncovering, it is necessary to thin seedlings frequently, weed frequently, and topdress frequently. Special attention should be paid to watering and pulling out inferior variant seedlings with dark green, malformed leaves, or clumps of seedlings, to achieve the goal of cultivating strong and good seedlings.

(3) Transplant early, plant densely, and strengthen field management: When the seedlings have ten to twelve true leaves, transplant them before Mangzhong (Grain in Ear), planting 4,000 to 5,000 holes per mu. After transplanting, field management must be strengthened. Generally, in the premise of deep digging, opening large holes, and applying sufficient base fertilizer, carry out two to four times of intertillage, weeding, and topdressing. It is also necessary to do a good job in filling vacancies, preventing drought, and controlling pests to strive to increase production.

    苎麻用种子繁殖好处多
    苎麻种子繁殖，我国农民早已采用。在“农桑辑要”一书中（1273年）即已有记载。直到现在，江西宜春、广西平乐、广东乐昌、四川泸县、湖南永兴等麻区的农民仍是采用，并有丰富的培育的经验。但由于过去是个体经济，苎麻种植面积小，多采用种根繁殖，因而种子繁殖，还未普遍推行。但是目前苎麻面积迅速扩大，如用种根繁殖，已经赶不上生产发展的需要。挖一亩老麻田，至多只能扩大十亩；而且运输不方便。挖多了影响麻的当年产量，尤其是新发展地区和种根不足的麻区，更不能采用这个方法。如用种子繁殖，一亩老麻田内选留十斤种子，育苗可供三百二十亩麻田用，比种根增加三十多倍。
    自1952年起，湖南、广东等省即已推行种子繁殖，并已获得成功。几年来湖南省用种子繁殖扩大的面积已达四万亩，广东省仅乐昌一县即有二万二千多亩，四川达县有一万五千多亩。
    当年新麻一般每亩可收三、四十斤种子，管理好的能收一百斤。群众反映：苎麻种子繁殖是花钱少，生长好，扩大快，运送轻便的好办法。因此，在今后扩大苎麻面积中，除根据具体情况采用分根、分株、压条等繁殖法外，必须积极采用种子繁殖法。
    有些人认为苎麻种子繁殖有发芽率和成活率低、变异多、麻皮薄等缺点，不敢大胆推广。这是由于他们没有认识到苎麻种子繁殖育苗，是一项技术性较强，而且比较繁杂细致的工作。只要在选好苗床、精细整地、施足底肥的基础上，抓住下面几个关键，以上缺点是可以克服的。
      （一）建立留种地，采选优良种子：苎麻是异花授粉作物，为了避免品种间杂交，要建立留种地，进行隔离品种；如不建立留种地，在现有麻地留种，必须严格进行去杂去劣，使种子纯度一致。留种麻要选优良品种，它的标准是当地产量高、皮层厚、品质好、耐旱、抗风的良种。
      （二）早播种、勤管理：早播种，可以早移栽，是争取当年多收麻的关键。一般以惊蛰至春分播种为宜。播后搞好复盖保苗，揭盖后要勤间苗、勤除草、勤追肥，尤应注意浇水和拔去叶片浓绿畸形或者幼苗丛生的劣变苗，达到培育壮苗、良苗。
      （三）早栽、密植、加强田间管理：当幼苗长有十至十二片真叶时，在芒种前移栽，每亩栽四、五千穴。栽后必须加强田间管理。一般应在深挖土，开大穴，施足基肥的前提下，进行中耕、除草、追肥二至四次。还须做好补缺、防旱、治虫等工作，争取提高产量。
