Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: Today marks the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This modern technical arm of the People's Liberation Army has been both a fighting force and a construction force since its birth. Over the past ten years, they have fought bravely and worked diligently, making significant contributions to the cause of liberation and socialist construction of the motherland.

This unit, from the moment it was established, vigorously cooperated with the frontline troops of the People's Liberation Army in battle. During the famous siege of Changchun, they spent two months repairing the Ji(lin)-Chang(chun) railway, ensuring the supply of materials to the besieging forces. Before the Liaoshen Campaign began, they repaired the railway leading from the rear to the front line of Jinzhou, enabling our army to unexpectedly approach the city and liberate Jinzhou. At the same time, they also repaired the railway from Meihekou to Shenyang and other railways in the war zone, fully guaranteeing the supply of soldiers, ammunition, and provisions. After the liberation of the entire Northeast, the Railway Corps followed the Northeast Field Army into the pass and quickly repaired the Beining Railway, excellently cooperating with the Pingjin Campaign.

In 1949, when the People's Liberation Army marched south with overwhelming force, the Railway Corps soldiers and railway workers everywhere unanimously guaranteed: "Wherever the army fights, the railway will be built!"

In this year, the Railway Corps, from the coast in the east to the Shaanxi-Gansu border in the west, from Heilongjiang in the north to the Pearl River Estuary in the south, endured heat and cold, overcame rainstorms and sandstorms, and fought against enemy air raids, bandits, and special agents' attacks and sabotage. Together with railway workers everywhere, they worked day and night to repair railways, restoring more than 8,300 kilometers of damaged railways to traffic. Among them, the railways repaired with the participation of the Railway Corps included the Jinpu, Jinghan, Longhai, Yuehan, Xianggui, Jingshen, Tongpu, Jin(zhou)-Gu(beikou), Gao(litun)-Xin(min), Da(hushan)-Zheng(jiatun), Shen(yang)-Ji(lin), Ji(lin)-Chang(chun), and Ha(erbin)-Chang(chun) lines, as well as major bridges over the Luanhe, Luohe, Huaihe, Xiangjiang, Zhanghe, and Songhua rivers. They not only supported the operations of the People's Liberation Army in all directions but also prepared favorable conditions for the recovery and development of the national economy after the war.

During wartime railway repairs, the officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps fully displayed their heroic and tenacious fighting spirit. During the repair of the Huaihe River Railway Bridge, diving hero Wang Jizhen gloriously sacrificed himself after diving six times in succession to quickly complete the task of stabilizing the wooden cage. When repairing the Yuehan Railway, the Railway Corps repaired twenty-eight bridges between Yueyang and Changsha in just twenty-eight days. On the Xianggui line, all the timber needed for the railway was felled, processed, and produced by the Railway Corps soldiers themselves, braving continuous rain, climbing mountains, and traversing forests. After Bai Chongxi's army destroyed this section of the railway, they boasted that the Communists would not be able to repair it for several years. However, thanks to the Railway Corps' arduous repairs, it was opened to traffic one month later.

After the victory of the Liberation War, the Railway Corps immediately plunged into the railway restoration and construction project. They repaired the Longhai, Jinghan, and Yuehan three major trunk lines, as well as 267 bridges and 146 kilometers of lines on the Zhegan and Tongpu railways, and communication lines. In the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains of the Northeast, two forest railways were built one after another. In addition, they also participated in the construction of the Lai(bin)-Mu(nanguan) Railway and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

Since the start of socialist construction in our country, the Railway Corps has become the shock force for railway construction in the motherland. In 1955, they spent more than nine months building the Li(tang)-Zhan(jiang) Railway, which the old Chinese bureaucrats and compradors had been shouting about for more than a decade but never built. After the completion of the Li-Zhan Railway, the officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps, together with the laborers, completed the arduous construction project of the Ying(tan)-Xia(men) Railway with the great ambition of "making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way" and "moving mountains and filling seas." At the same time, the Railway Corps also built the Shi(lu)-Ba(suo) line on Hainan Island, the Bi(sezhai)-He(kou) section of the Kun(ming)-He(kou) Railway, the Jin(chenjiang)-Du(yun) section of the Qian-Gui Railway, and the special line for the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station.

In the spring of 1957, a part of the Railway Corps was transferred to the Baotou-Lanzhou line to undertake the construction task of its northern section - the Baotou to Yinchuan section. On this section, the railway had to cross the Yellow River twice, pass over the four major canals of the Inner Mongolia Hetao seven times, and pass through the Ordos Plateau and desert areas. The Railway Corps soldiers there overcame the violent sandstorms of Inner Mongolia and the ice floes after the thawing of the Yellow River, laying steel rails forward section by section, and are now advancing towards Yinchuan.

At present, the Railway Corps troops are also carrying out construction projects on various sections of the Min-Dian Railway, as well as the Nan(ping)-Fu(zhou) line, the Wuhan Railway Hub Station, the Kun(ming)-(Pinglang) line, and the Lian(jiang)-Mao(ming) line on the east side of the Li-Zhan Railway at the same time.

The ten years since the establishment of the Railway Corps have been ten years of heroic struggle and ten years of hard work. At present, under the new situation of the great leap forward in socialist construction in our country, they are implementing the Party's general line, striving for leap forward after leap forward, and fighting to accelerate the railway construction of the motherland in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    是一支战斗部队　又是一支建设部队
    铁道兵奋战十年贡献巨大
    新华社5日讯　今天是中国人民解放军铁道兵成立十周年。人民解放军的这一支现代化技术兵种，从诞生那天起就一直是一支战斗部队，又是一支建设部队。十年来，他们英勇奋战，辛勤劳动，对祖国的解放事业和社会主义建设事业作了重大贡献。
    这支部队一诞生，就在战场上有力地配合了解放军前线大军作战。在著名的长春围城战中，他们用两个月的时间，修复了吉（林）长（春）铁路，保证了围城部队的物资供应。在辽沈战役打响之前，他们曾修通了由后方通往锦州前线的铁路，使我军出敌不意地兵临城下，解放了锦州。与此同时，他们还修复了梅河口通往沈阳和战区内的其他铁路，充分保证了兵员、军火和给养供应。东北全境解放，铁道兵随东北野战军进关后，又以飞快的速度修通了北宁铁路，出色地配合了平津战役。
    1949年，当人民解放军各路大军以排山倒海之势向南进军的时候，铁道兵战士和各地铁路职工一致保证：“大军打到那里，铁路就修到那里！”
    这一年，铁道兵在东从沿海，西到陕甘边区，北自黑龙江，南止珠江口，一面忍热耐寒，战胜暴雨和风沙，一面跟敌机骚扰、土匪和特务的袭击、破坏进行斗争，与各地铁路职工一道，不分昼夜地抢修铁路，使被破坏了的八千三百多公里的铁路恢复了通车。其中，铁道兵参加修复的铁路就有津浦、京汉、陇海、粤汉、湘桂、京沈、同蒲、锦（州）古（北口）、高（力屯）新（民）、大（虎山）郑（家屯）、沈（阳）吉（林）、吉（林）长（春）、哈（尔滨）长（春）等线，还有滦河、洛河、淮河、湘江、樟河、松花江等大桥。他们不仅支援了解放军各路大军作战，并为战后国民经济的恢复和发展准备了有利条件。
    在战时抢修铁路，铁道兵官兵充分发扬了英勇顽强的战斗精神。在抢修淮河大铁桥时，潜水英雄王吉珍为了迅速完成稳定木笼任务，连续六次潜水而光荣牺牲。抢修粤汉铁路的时候，仅仅二十八天，铁道兵修复了岳阳到长沙间的二十八座桥梁。在湘桂线上，铁路需要的全部木料，都是铁道兵战士冒着连绵霪雨，登山穿林、自己采伐、自己加工制作的。白崇禧军队破坏了这段铁路后曾扬言说，共军几年也修复不了。可是，在铁道兵奋战抢修之下，一个月后就通车了。
    解放战争胜利后，铁道兵又立即投入了铁路的恢复建设工程。他们修复了陇海、京汉、粤汉三大干线和浙赣、同蒲等铁路上的二百六十七座桥梁、一百四十六公里的线路，以及通讯线路等。在东北大小兴安岭地带，先后修建了两条森林铁路。此外，还参加了来（宾）睦（南关）铁路以及宝成铁路修建工程。
    我国开始社会主义建设以来，铁道兵成了祖国铁路建设的突击队。1955年，他们用九个多月的时间，修成了旧中国官僚买办叫喊了十几年始终没修成的黎（塘）湛（江）铁路。黎湛铁路建成后，铁道兵官兵和民工们一起，又以“让高山低头、河水让路”“移山填海”的伟大气魄，完成了鹰（潭）厦（门）铁路这一艰巨的建设工程。与此同时，铁道兵还修建了海南岛上的石（碌）八（所）线、昆（明）河（口）铁路上的碧（色寨）河（口）段、黔桂铁路上的金（城江）都（匀）段、新安江水电站专用线等铁路。
    1957年春天，一部分铁道兵调往包（头）兰（州）线，担负它的北段——包头到银川段的施工任务。在这一段上，铁路要两跨黄河，七过内蒙古河套四大干渠，并穿过额尔多斯高原以及沙漠地带。铁道兵战士在那里战胜了内蒙古的狂暴风沙和黄河解冻后的流冰，将钢轨节节铺向前去，现在正向着银川方向猛进。
    目前，铁道兵部队还在闽滇大铁路各段和南（平）福（州）线、武汉铁路枢纽站、昆（明）—（平浪）线以及黎湛铁路东面的廉（江）茂（名）线，同时进行修建工程。
    铁道兵建军以来的十年，是英勇奋战的十年，也是辛勤劳动的十年。当前，他们正在我国社会主义建设大跃进的新形势下，贯彻党的总路线，争取跃进再跃进，为多快好省地加速祖国的铁路建设而奋斗。
