    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 20th. According to the "Al-Ahram" newspaper on July 20th, a Baghdad dispatch stated: A spokesperson for the Supreme Power Committee of the Iraqi Republic announced that the fighting within Iraq has been completed, and now preparations are underway for external battles.
    The spokesperson said that the imperialists are using propaganda that spreads lies to defame the Iraqi nationalist movement as the beginning of the battle, but world opinion has already recognized the truth from the experience of the Egyptian revolution. He said: "This movement of the imperialist countries is not surprising, because the imperialists have lost one of their most important fortresses in Iraq, and they have lost their minds." The spokesperson emphasized that this movement of the imperialists is bound to fail, just as the imperialists' movement against the Egyptian revolution failed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 21st. According to the "Al-Ahram" newspaper today, fifteen Iraqi ambassadors to foreign countries have declared their loyalty to the government of the Iraqi Republic.

    伊拉克准备抵抗侵略
    伊十五位驻外大使宣布忠于共和国政府
    新华社开罗20日电  据“金字塔报”20日刊载的巴格达消息：伊拉克共和国最高权力委员会发言人宣布，伊拉克国内的战斗已经完成，现在准备着对外的战斗。
    发言人说，帝国主义者以散布诋毁伊拉克民族主义运动的谎言的宣传作为战斗的开端，但是，世界舆论从过去埃及革命的经验中就已经认识了事实的真相。他说：“帝国主义国家的这个运动不足为奇，因为帝国主义者失掉他们在伊拉克的一个最重要的堡垒，他们就丧失了理智。”发言人强调说，帝国主义者的这个运动一定失败，正如帝国主义者反对埃及革命的运动遭到了失败一样。
    新华社开罗21日电  据“金字塔报”今天报道，已经有十五位伊拉克的驻外国的大使宣布忠于伊拉克共和国政府。
    伊拉克共和国政府已经通知开罗阿拉伯联盟总部，免去伊拉克驻开罗大使易卜拉欣·胡德里的职务，并且任命了新的大使。
    胡德里曾经是伊拉克出席阿拉伯联盟会议的代表。胡德里和伊拉克驻土耳其的大使拒绝返回巴格达。伊拉克共和国政府还撤回了伊拉克驻在开罗的武官。
