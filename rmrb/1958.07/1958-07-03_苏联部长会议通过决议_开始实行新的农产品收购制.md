    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 2nd (via TASS) – In order to realize the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on abolishing the system of compulsory delivery of agricultural products, etc., and to implement the law on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations, the Soviet Council of Ministers passed a resolution. This resolution has been published in the Moscow newspapers on the 1st.
    The Soviet Council of Ministers decided to abolish the system of compulsory delivery of agricultural products by collective farms to the state, starting from July 1st of this year. From this year onwards, the state will purchase agricultural products and raw materials from collective farms through procurement. The Council of Ministers approved the tiered prices for state procurement of agricultural products from collective farms in each republic. The resolution also abolished the system of paying machine tractor stations, technical repair stations, and specialized stations for their work in collective farms with in-kind payments. Collective farms will pay for this work in cash according to the prices set by the Councils of Ministers of each republic. When necessary, collective farms are allowed to postpone payment for the work done by machine tractor stations and specialized stations in the previous year for two to three years.
    All debts owed by collective farms in the past few years for the delivery of agricultural products and for in-kind payments for the work of machine tractor stations and specialized stations up to July 1, 1958, are all written off. However, the total amount of agricultural products to be delivered by each collective farm in 1958 according to the plan will not be reduced.
    The institutions and enterprises engaged in the procurement of agricultural products and raw materials will advance interest-free funds to collective farms to compensate for the agricultural products sold to the state. To this end, the Soviet State Bank will provide loans to these institutions and enterprises.
    The Councils of Ministers of each republic will study the prices of agricultural products annually based on expected harvests and production costs.
    Changes in procurement prices will be approved by the Soviet Council of Ministers.

    苏联部长会议通过决议
    开始实行新的农产品收购制
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科1日讯：为了实现苏共中央六月全会关于取消义务交售制等问题的决议和执行关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的法律，苏联部长会议通过了一项决议。这个决议已经登载在1日的莫斯科报纸上。
    苏联部长会议决定从今年7月1日起取消集体农庄向国家义务交售农产品的制度。从今年开始将由国家通过收购方式来采购集体农庄的农产品和原料。部长会议批准了国家向各加盟共和国集体农庄收购农产品的级差价格。决议还取消了向机器拖拉机站、技术修理站以及专业站在集体农庄中完成的工作支付实物报酬的制度。集体农庄将根据各加盟共和国部长会议所确定的价格用现金来支付这些工作的报酬。在必要时，准许集体农庄延期两年到三年支付机器拖拉机站和专业站在前一年所作的工作的报酬。
    集体农庄过去一些年内在交售农产品方面以及截至1958年7月1日为止对机器拖拉机站和专业站的工作支付实物报酬方面所积欠的全部债务全部勾销。但是，1958年各集体农庄根据计划交售的农产品总量并不减少。
    从事采购农产品和原料的机构和企业将向集体农庄预付不收利息的款项来偿付向国家出售的农业品。为此，苏联国家银行将向这些机构和企业提供贷款。
    各加盟共和国部长会议每年将根据预计收成和生产费用来研究农产品价格问题。
    采购价格的变动将由苏联部长会议批准。
