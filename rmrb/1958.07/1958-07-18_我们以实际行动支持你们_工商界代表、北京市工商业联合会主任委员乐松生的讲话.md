Comrades,

    On behalf of all industrialists and businessmen in the city, I firmly support our government's statement against the US armed intervention in Lebanon and the correct measures taken to recognize the government of the Republic of Iraq. At the same time, I fully support the solemn statement of the Soviet government.

    We strongly protest with extreme indignation against the despicable and shameful war provocation of US imperialism, which openly violates the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and carries out armed interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon. This aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism is not only directed at Lebanon, but also at Iraq and the United Arab Republic, and at all peace-loving people in the Middle East and the world. Its arrogant attempt is to strangle the national independence movement of the entire Arab East in order to realize its colonial rule in the entire Middle East. This jackal behavior of US imperialism, under the just struggle of the Lebanese people against aggression, and with the full support of the people of Arab countries and all peace-loving people in the world, is doomed to failure. We are determined to drive the aggressive troops of US imperialism out of Lebanon and will never allow such war-provoking actions.

    We hail the great victory of the Iraqi people in overthrowing the rule of the feudal dynasty and safeguarding national independence. We warmly welcome the measures taken by the government of the Republic of Iraq to abide by the principles of the Bandung Conference, withdraw from the aggressive Baghdad military treaty, and recognize the United Arab Republic. This marks the shameful failure of US imperialism's aggressive conspiracy in the Near and Middle East, and it is another great victory for the national independence movement of the Arab countries against colonial rule. We congratulate them on moving from victory to greater victory.

    The current world situation is that the East wind prevails over the West wind. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, as well as the strength of all peace-loving forces in the world, is incomparably powerful. Imperialists are never allowed to run amok. US imperialism is a paper tiger, the setting sun of dusk, and cannot scare the people of Lebanon and Iraq. The just struggle of the Lebanese and Iraqi people is by no means isolated. With the full support of all peace-loving people in the world, if US imperialism does not abandon its aggressive ambitions, it will surely be beaten to a pulp. Imperialists who play with fire will inevitably burn themselves. The shameful failures of US imperialism's aggression against Korea and the aggression of British and French imperialism against Egypt have already given them a powerful answer.

    All of us industrialists and businessmen in the city must, under the leadership of the Party and the government, take practical actions to fight to the end against US imperialism's armed aggression against Lebanon and support the just struggle of the Iraqi people.

    我们以实际行动支持你们
    工商界代表、北京市工商业联合会主任委员乐松生的讲话各位同志：
    我代表全市工商业者坚决拥护我国政府关于反对美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的声明和承认伊拉克共和国政府的正确措施，同时完全拥护苏联政府的严正声明。
    我们以万分愤怒的心情强烈抗议美帝国主义公然违反联合国宪章的根本原则、武装干涉黎巴嫩内政的卑鄙可耻的战争挑衅。美帝国主义这种侵略阴谋，不仅是针对着黎巴嫩，而且也针对着伊拉克与阿拉伯联合共和国，针对着整个中东和全世界爱好和平的人民。它的狂妄企图是要扼杀整个阿拉伯东方的民族独立运动，以便在全部中东实现它的殖民主义统治。美帝国主义的这种豺狼行为，在黎巴嫩人民反抗侵略的正义斗争，以及阿拉伯国家人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的全力支持下，注定是要失败的。我们坚决要美帝国主义侵略军队从黎巴嫩滚出去，决不允许这种战争挑衅的行动。
    我们欢呼伊拉克人民推翻封建王朝的统治，维护民族独立的伟大胜利。对伊拉克共和国政府所采取的遵守万隆会议原则，退出侵略性的巴格达军事条约，并且承认阿拉伯联合共和国的措施，我们表示热烈的欢迎。这标志着美帝国主义在中近东的侵略阴谋的可耻失败，也是阿拉伯国家人民反对殖民主义统治的民族独立运动又一次伟大的胜利，我们祝贺他们从胜利基础上，走向更大的胜利。
    现在全世界的形势，是东风压倒西风，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，以及全世界爱好和平的力量无比强大，决不允许帝国主义者横行霸道。美帝国主义是纸老虎，是傍晚的落日，是吓不倒黎巴嫩和伊拉克人民的。黎巴嫩和伊拉克人民的正义斗争，决不是孤立的，有了全世界爱好和平人民的全力支援，美帝国主义如果不放弃它的侵略野心，一定会碰得头破血流。帝国主义者玩火必然自焚。美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和英、法帝国主义侵略埃及的可耻失败，都已经给了它们有力的回答。
    我们全市工商业者一定要在党和政府领导下，以实际行动，为反对美帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和支持伊拉克人民的正义斗争而奋斗到底。
