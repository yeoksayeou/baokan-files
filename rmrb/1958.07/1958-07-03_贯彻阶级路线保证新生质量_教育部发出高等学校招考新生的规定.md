Reported by this newspaper: The Ministry of Education recently issued regulations regarding college and university admissions for this year, with the following summary:

In order to facilitate the implementation of the principle of adapting to local conditions and individual school conditions in college admissions, and to promote the enthusiasm of local authorities and universities in running schools, the national unified admissions system will be changed this year, and schools will implement individual or joint admissions.

In accordance with the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, college admissions must conscientiously implement the class line, ensure the quality of new students, and guarantee the completion of the admissions plan. Based on the above requirements, the following provisions are made for college admissions this year:

I. Change the national unified admissions system for colleges and universities and implement individual or joint admissions. The specific arrangements for admissions work shall be handled separately by provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and various colleges and universities based on local and school conditions.

II. The political review and health examination work for college admissions shall be uniformly deployed by the Ministry of Education in conjunction with relevant central departments, and shall be carried out by the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions.

III. The education departments (bureaus) and higher education departments (bureaus) of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions shall, in conjunction with relevant departments, organize colleges and universities within their respective provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to establish admissions agencies for provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and, in conjunction with relevant departments in the examination areas, establish examination area offices to uniformly organize and lead local admissions work. Colleges and universities should work under the leadership of the admissions agencies in the admissions locations.

IV. Any citizen of the People's Republic of China who has a high school diploma or equivalent cultural level, is under the age of thirty (workers, peasants, worker-peasant cadres, demobilized soldiers, veterans, and on-the-job cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than ten years may have their age appropriately relaxed to under thirty-five), and meets one of the following conditions may apply for the examination: (1) This year's graduates of senior high schools and worker-peasant rapid middle schools. (2) This year's graduates of secondary specialized schools, approved by the competent business department or local education administrative department to pursue further education. (3) On-the-job personnel of party and government organs, institutions, enterprises, mass organizations, etc., approved by their work unit. For the above three items, a graduation certificate or a letter of introduction for application must be provided. (4) Demobilized soldiers, veterans, and retired soldiers holding a certificate from the demobilization construction committee (or the local civil affairs department) above the county level (districts for large and medium-sized cities) of their place of origin or from a unit above the regiment (or equivalent to the regiment) level of the military. (5) Returned overseas Chinese students and students from Hong Kong and Macau holding a certificate from the domestic overseas Chinese affairs agency or the "Hong Kong and Macau High School Graduates Returning to Guangzhou for Further Education Guidance Committee." (6) Other educated youth holding a certificate from the people's committee above the district or township level of their locality.

V. This year's college admissions will still be divided into three categories of examinations according to different types of majors. (1) Applying for various majors in engineering and science (including various science majors and geography departments in higher normal colleges, majors in natural geography in comprehensive universities), agricultural mechanization, water conservancy and soil improvement, aquatic product processing, industrial fishing, agricultural meteorology, land planning, forest logging and transportation, water transportation, forest logging and transportation machinery, wood machinery processing, forest product chemistry and other majors in agricultural and forestry colleges, pharmacy majors in medical colleges, etc., the following subjects will be examined: Chinese language, general knowledge of politics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, foreign language. (2) Applying for various majors in medicine, agriculture and forestry, biology departments, physical education departments (including biology and physical education departments in higher normal colleges), psychology majors, etc., the following subjects will be examined: Chinese language, general knowledge of politics, physics, chemistry, fundamentals of Darwinism, foreign language; applicants for physical education departments will also be tested in physical education skills. (3) Applying for various majors in arts, history, politics and law (including literature, history, education, political education, etc. in higher normal colleges), finance and economics, and art, as well as philosophy, political economics, and economic geography majors in comprehensive universities, etc., the following subjects will be examined: Chinese language, general knowledge of politics, history, geography, foreign language. Applicants for finance and economics majors, economic geography majors, and philosophy majors will also be tested in mathematics (professional cadres engaged in finance and economics work who apply for finance and economics majors may apply for exemption from the mathematics test); the additional test subjects for applicants for art majors (including music and art departments in higher normal colleges) will be separately determined by the relevant colleges and universities.

VI. The principles for admitting new students to colleges and universities are stipulated as follows: On the premise of ensuring political quality, combined with academic and health conditions, select and admit better-quality new students.

Candidates who meet the following conditions shall be given priority in admission: (1) For applicants who are workers, peasants, worker-peasant cadres, graduates of worker-peasant rapid middle schools, on-the-job cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than ten years, demobilized soldiers, and veterans, if their political and health conditions meet the standards and their academic examination results reach a certain standard (capable of attending classes after enrollment), the method of giving priority to admission before admitting general candidates shall be adopted. (2) For applicants who are ethnic minority students, children of martyrs, demobilized soldiers, veterans, retired soldiers, on-the-job cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than five years, young intellectuals who have participated in industrial and agricultural labor for more than two years, as well as overseas Chinese students and students from Hong Kong and Macau, the method of giving priority to admission with the same scores shall be adopted.

For workers, peasants, graduates of worker-peasant rapid middle schools, worker-peasant cadres, etc., the method of admission without examination can be adopted: For graduates of worker-peasant rapid middle schools, workers, peasants, worker-peasant cadres, and veteran cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for a long time, if their political and health conditions meet the standards and the relevant colleges and universities consider them capable of attending classes after enrollment, the method of guaranteed admission shall be adopted. It shall be handled in conjunction with worker-peasant rapid middle schools, departments responsible for recommending candidates, and colleges and universities.

VII. Due to the large imbalance between the regional distribution of students and the college admissions tasks in various regions, in order to ensure the comprehensive completion of the admissions tasks and considering the nature and professional settings of various colleges and universities, the regional scope of admissions for various types of colleges and universities will be uniformly arranged according to the principle of combining local recruitment with regional adjustment. (1) Higher normal, medical, agricultural, or other colleges and universities that mainly train cadres for the province, city, or autonomous region should, in principle, recruit students from the province, city, or autonomous region. (2) Comprehensive universities, engineering, language, political science and law, finance and economics, art, and sports colleges and universities within the cooperation zone should, in principle, recruit students within the cooperation zone or the original large administrative region where the school is located. (3) National colleges and universities may recruit students nationwide. Some schools, although not national, may recruit students from other appropriate provinces and cities beyond the region where the school is located due to the special nature of the majors offered.

The admission adjustment plan for colleges and universities in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions will be formulated by the Ministry of Education in consultation with relevant provinces, cities, and autonomous regions and relevant schools.

VIII. The admissions examinations for colleges and universities implementing joint admissions shall, in principle, be held within the period from July 20 to 31; the examination dates for schools conducting individual admissions shall be determined by the school and the relevant provincial, municipal, and autonomous region admissions agencies.

IX. In order to facilitate candidates' applications, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should, in principle, maintain the previous unified admissions examination area settings; in areas with a large number of high school graduates, various localities should, based on the specific circumstances, increase the number of examination areas or examination venues as much as possible.

X. After the first round of admissions, schools that have not admitted the required number of students may conduct a second round of admissions, or select a portion of the better-qualified candidates who have not been admitted, solicit their willingness, and admit them to the school.

XI. All expenses required by various candidates during the application period shall be borne by the candidates themselves. The travel expenses to the school after admission shall be paid by the work unit for on-the-job cadres and demobilized soldiers; this year's graduates of worker-peasant rapid middle schools will be subsidized by the local admissions agency or education administrative department; the travel expenses to the school for other new students shall be borne by themselves, but individuals who have difficulty raising travel expenses due to long distances to the school and family financial difficulties may apply for subsidies from the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region admissions agencies or the local education administrative department.

XII. Newly admitted students should report to the school at the time specified by the admitting school.

XIII. Colleges and universities should conduct political and health re-examinations immediately after new students enroll. Those who fail the re-examination will have their admission qualifications revoked.

XIV. Colleges and universities conducting individual or joint admissions shall formulate admissions brochures in accordance with these regulations and in conjunction with the specific requirements of the school and announce them to the candidates.

XV. Local admissions work agencies and various colleges and universities should closely rely on the leadership of the local Party committees, governments, and school Party committees to do a good job in admissions work.

    七、由于学生的地区分布和各地区的高等学校招生任务之间有较大的不平衡，为了保证全面完成招生任务，并且考虑到各高等学校的性质和专业设置情况，对于各类高等学校招生的地区范围，根据就地取材与地区调剂相结合的原则，作如下统一安排。（一）主要为本省、市、自治区培养干部的高等师范、医、农院校或其他院校，以招收本省、市、自治区的学生为原则。（二）协作区性的综合大学、工科、语文、政法、财经、艺术、体育等院校，原则上在学校所在地的协作区或者原大行政区范围内招生。（三）全国性的高等学校，可以在全国招生。有些学校虽不是全国性的，但因设置的专业特殊，可以超越学校所在地区范围到其他适当的省、市招生。

    八、实行联合招生的高等学校的招生考试，原则规定在7月20日—31日这一段时间内举行；单独招生的学校的考试日期，由学校和有关省、市、自治区招生机构商定。
    九、为了便利考生报考，各省、市、自治区原则上仍应维持以往统一招生的考区设置；凡是高中毕业生较多的地方，各地应根据具体情况，尽可能地增设一些考区或考场。

    十一、各类考生在报考期间所需要的一切费用，均由本人自备。被录取后的赴校路费，在职干部、转业军人由所在单位发给，工农速成中学今年毕业生由当地招生机构或教育行政部门给予补助；其他新生的赴校路费应由本人负责，但个别因赴校路途较远，家庭经济困难，确实无力筹措赴校路费的，可以向所在省、市、自治区招生机构或当地教育行政部门申请补助。
    十二、被录取的新生，应按照录取学校所规定的时间到校。
    十三、高等学校在新生入学后，应即进行政治、健康复查。复查不合格的，取消入学资格。
    十四、单独或者联合招生的高等学校，按照本规定并结合学校的具体要求，制订招生简章，向考生公布。
    十五、各地招生工作机构和各高等学校，应密切依靠地方党委、政府和学校党委的领导，做好招生工作。
