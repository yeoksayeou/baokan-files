Xinhua News Agency, July 26th, Ottawa dispatch: Canadian Foreign Minister Smith stated during a foreign policy debate in the House of Commons on the 25th that he favored convening a summit conference within the scope of the United Nations Security Council, and opposed "allowing time and membership issues to overwhelm the extreme necessity of holding such a conference."
    Opposition Liberal Party leader Pearson stated in his speech that he believed the US and British intervention was "inopportune." He warned the West to adopt a realistic attitude towards the Middle East situation, accept Arab nationalism and the union of Arab republics, and recognize the strength of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's concern for the Middle East.

    加拿大外长史密斯说
    首脑会议有极大必要性
    新华社26日讯　渥太华消息：加拿大外交部长史密斯25日在众议院的外交政策辩论中发言时表示，他赞成召开联合国安全理事会范围内的首脑会议，并且反对“让时间和成员问题压倒举行这样的会议的极大必要性”。　　反对党自由党领袖皮尔逊在发言中表示，他认为美英的干涉行动是“不合时宜”的。他警告西方要对中东局势采取现实的态度，接受阿拉伯民族主义和各阿拉伯共和国的联盟，并且承认苏联的强大和苏联对中东的关心。
