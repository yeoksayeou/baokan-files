In the enterprises, institutions, organizations, schools, and military units that have completed rectification and reform, the rectification movement is about to enter its fourth stage, namely, the stage of each person studying documents, criticizing and reflecting, and improving themselves. In this stage, every cadre, especially Party member cadres, should conscientiously study the Party's line and style, summarize the gains of this rectification movement, examine their shortcomings in ideology and work, and conduct mutual criticism and self-criticism, in order to improve their awareness, strengthen unity within the Party, and strengthen the unity between the Party and the masses.
	--Work Report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress
Eliminate the "Almost There" Mentality and Seriously Examine the Current Situation of Rectification
	(Our News) The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of responsible persons from various departments, commissions, and bureaus' Party groups on June 23. At the meeting, Comrade Hui Yuyu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, gave instructions on the issue of striving for a complete victory in the rectification movement.
	Comrade Hui Yuyu first pointed out: The rectification movement in provincial-level organs has achieved great results, but we must not be satisfied with the achievements we have made. The rectification movement requires the earnest efforts of the fourth stage to achieve complete victory. We must adhere to taking rectification as the key link and carry the rectification movement through to the end. We will never give up until we achieve complete victory.
	He said that recently, some units have lacked the drive to persist in rectification and reform to the end, which is worthy of everyone's attention. The main reason for this situation is that some leading cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance and requirements of rectification, especially their determination and consciousness to improve their own ideological style. They either emphasize that current production is tight and work is busy, leaving little time to grasp rectification; or they believe that the rectification has been going on for more than a year, and the achievements have been considerable, leading to an "almost there" mentality. They only see the achievements and do not see or are unwilling to see the existing problems, thus paralyzing themselves. Therefore, he asked the leading comrades of all units to review the central government's instructions on rectification, examine the current situation of rectification, in order to seize the fourth stage and carry the rectification movement through to the end.
	Then, he said that when entering the fourth stage of rectification, we must first closely combine the study of the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress with rectification, and conscientiously study Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the Central Committee's report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, and Chairman Mao's instructions on working methods. The purpose of the study is to further clarify and stand firm on the class stand, adhere to the Party's general line for socialist construction, master the ideological methods of Marxism-Leninism, and improve the style of work, and according to the spirit of the documents, to examine one's own thinking and work, in order to completely burn the "three evils and five airs," pull out the white flags and firmly plant the red flags, strengthen the mass viewpoint, implement the mass line, and promote current production and work to a new peak through rectification.
	Finally, he said: The fourth stage of the rectification movement is an important stage to determine the complete victory of the rectification, and it is also an important stage to consolidate, improve, and develop the achievements of the rectification movement. Party organizations of all units must strengthen leadership, and the responsible persons of the Party groups must personally take command, correctly and powerfully implement the central government's rectification instructions, and complete the tasks of the fourth stage of the rectification movement according to the established time.
Must Fully Mobilize the Masses to Launch a Climax of Ideological Revolution
	(Our News) The Gansu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to Party committees at all levels on June 27 regarding the implementation of the Central Committee's notice on the fourth stage of rectification.
	The instructions pointed out: The fourth stage of rectification should take the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the general line of socialist construction as the key link, and launch a mass-based new upsurge of rectification with ideological examination as the central content from top to bottom and from bottom to top. This examination should be combined with the meetings of various departments to examine the ideology of business policies, as well as various meetings to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress.
	The instructions specifically stated that in order to achieve the goal of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology through this stage of ideological examination, pulling out white flags and planting red flags everywhere, giving prominence to politics, and correcting the direction, it is necessary to ensure that every inch of land is planted with red flags and every second is used for the Great Leap Forward. The work in this stage is very important, and it is the decisive stage to strive for a complete victory in the movement. It must be done carefully and meticulously, without any ambiguity.
	The instructions pointed out that this stage of rectification mainly solves problems in the ideological realm. It is necessary to adhere to the method of gentle breeze and fine rain, the method of "unity-criticism-unity," and fully mobilize the masses to launch a climax of the ideological revolution, and carry out a great debate on being both red and expert, with the criticism of individualism and right-leaning conservative thinking as the main content.
	Finally, the instructions particularly emphasized that the fourth stage is the decisive key to obtaining a complete victory in the rectification movement, and it is an extremely important stage for laying a solid ideological foundation for the correct implementation of the Party's general line for building socialism. The first secretaries of Party committees at all levels and the Party group secretaries of each department must personally take command, seize the time, make specific arrangements, conduct in-depth inspections, and promote the rapid development of the movement, especially to vigorously strengthen the weak links and thoroughly carry out the rectification movement from start to finish. Any approach that emphasizes work as being too busy, abandons leadership, allows things to drift along, starts vigorously but ends feebly, or attempts to hastily conclude the movement is extremely wrong and harmful, and is a manifestation of right-leaning thinking that does not value political and ideological work, and should be resolutely opposed. At the end of the rectification, the leaders of each unit should summarize the gains of this rectification movement to the masses, formulate necessary systems, improve their work, and adhere to the system of cadre labor training, consolidating the achievements of the rectification. In order to maintain and carry forward the revolutionary spirit brought about by the rectification movement, the leading organs at all levels can retain the set of working methods and organizational forms (such as the Rectification Office) used to lead the rectification movement and apply them to their daily work to solve the outstanding problems that have not yet been resolved in the rectification, and lead the regular work of the organs by means of mass movements.
All Units Should Strengthen Leadership to Ensure Complete Victory in Rectification
	(Our News) On June 27, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee convened a meeting of responsible comrades from the directly affiliated organs of the autonomous region. Secretary Wang Duo made arrangements for the fourth stage of rectification in the directly affiliated organs of the autonomous region. Secretary Wang Duo said: The fourth stage is the last stage of rectification, and it is also an important stage for rectification to achieve complete victory. All units must strengthen leadership over this stage and carry the rectification through to the end, and must never start vigorously but end feebly. He said that the previous stage of rectification mainly solved common problems, solved the problems of contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and contradictions among the people, transformed the style of leadership, and overcame right-leaning conservative thinking and the "three styles and five airs," promoting the Great Leap Forward in production and work. However, this stage of rectification did not conduct a systematic examination and criticism of the ideological style of each cadre. Therefore, the task of the fourth stage is to continue to expose and criticize bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism, that is, to expose and criticize right-leaning conservative thinking and dogmatism and empiricism tendencies in the implementation of the Party's line and policies; to expose and criticize individualism, departmentalism, liberalism, nationalism, and other erroneous ideas, in order to improve the communist ideological level of all Party members and cadres. The characteristic of this stage is a mass-based conscious ideological revolution movement, requiring everyone to examine their own ideological errors based on their specific circumstances, pull out the white flags and plant the red flags, and formulate personal leap forward plans to achieve the goal of being both red and expert.
	The steps of the fourth stage of rectification should be: First, organize cadres to study the designated rectification documents to further clarify and stand firm on the class stand, adhere to the Party's general line for socialist construction, and master the ideological methods of Marxism-Leninism. Second, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and examine oneself through heart-to-heart talks and conversations. Small-scale forums and big-character posters can be adopted. If major principled disagreements are discovered, debates can be conducted within a certain range to unify understanding, strengthen unity, improve awareness, and improve work. In debates and criticisms, we must adhere to the principle of starting from unity and reaching unity through criticism, and we must adhere to the principle of being both serious and earnest and gentle breeze and fine rain. Third, everyone should write a self-reflection summary, solicit opinions through mutual circulation and individual conversations, and obtain the help of other comrades. The content of the ideological summary is roughly: the ideological gains in the rectification movement, the understanding of the struggle between the two roads, the examination of personal bourgeois ideology and leadership style, and working methods. Fourth, based on the ideological summary, we must formulate personal red and expert plans. After the end of the rectification, each unit must make a summary of this rectification movement, formulate regular political and ideological education systems, and consolidate the achievements of the rectification.

    江苏甘肃内蒙古党委布置第四阶段整风
    要求人人提高觉悟个个插上红旗
    在完成了整改的企业、机关、团体、学校和部队中的整风运动，即将进入第四阶段，即每人学习文件、批评反省、提高自己的阶段。在这个阶段中间，每个干部，特别是党员干部，应当认真地研究党的路线和作风，总结这一次整风运动的收获，检查自己在思想上和工作上的缺点，进行相互间的批评和自我批评，以便提高觉悟、增强党内的团结和党同群众的团结。
    ——中国共产党中央委员会向第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的工作报告
    消除“差不多”思想认真检查整风的现状
    本报讯　中共江苏省委于6月23日召开了各部委、各厅局党组负责人会议。会上，省委书记惠浴宇同志就争取整风运动全胜的问题作了指示。
    惠浴宇同志首先指出：省级机关的整风运动已经取得很大成绩，但是，我们决不能满足既得的成就，整风运动需要经过第四阶段的切实努力才能获得全面胜利。各单位必须坚持以整风为纲，善始善终地把整风运动进行到底，不获全胜，决不罢休。
    他说，近来有些单位把整改坚持到底的劲头不足，这是很值得大家注意的，形成这种情况的主要原因，是有些领导干部对整风的意义和要求认识不足，特别是对改进领导干部本身的思想作风的决心和自觉不够；他们或者强调当前的生产紧张，工作繁忙，没有多少时间抓整风；或者认为整风已经一年多了，成绩已经不小了，以致产生了“差不多”的思想，他们只看到成绩，而看不到或者不愿意看到存在的问题，这样就把自己麻痹起来了。因此，他要求各单位领导同志重新温习中央关于整风的指示，检查整风的现状，以便抓紧第四阶段，把整风运动坚持到底。
    接着他说，在转入整风第四阶段时，首先要把学习八大二次会议文件和整风紧密结合起来，认真学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告、中央向八大二次会议的报告和毛主席关于工作方法的指示，学习的目的在于进一步明确、站稳阶级立场，坚持党的社会主义建设的总路线，掌握马克思列宁主义的思想方法和改进工作作风，并根据文件的精神，来检查自己的思想和工作，以彻底烧掉三害五气，拔掉白旗插牢红旗，加强群众观点，贯彻群众路线，通过整风把当前的生产和工作推向新的高峰。
    最后，他说：整风运动第四阶段是决定整风全胜的重要阶段，也是巩固、提高和发展整风运动成果的重要阶段，各单位党组织必须加强领导，党组负责人要亲自挂帅，正确有力地贯彻中央整风指示，按既定时间完成整风运动第四阶段的任务。
    必须充分发动群众  掀起思想革命高潮
    本报讯　中共甘肃省委于6月27日向各级党委发出关于贯彻执行中央关于整风第四阶段的通知的指示。
    指示指出：整风第四阶段，应以党的八大二次会议精神和社会主义建设总路线为纲，自上而下、上下结合，开展一个群众性的以思想检查为中心内容的整风新高潮。这个检查，应与各部门检查业务方针思想的会议，以及传达八大二次会议精神的各种会议结合起来。
    指示特别提出，要通过这一阶段的思想大检查，达到兴无灭资，在一切地方拔掉白旗，插遍红旗，政治挂帅，方向端正的目的，必须做到插红旗寸土不让，大跃进分秒必争。这一阶段的工作是非常重要的，是争取运动全胜的决定性阶段，必须认真细致的做好，不能有一点含糊。
    指示指出，这一阶段的整风，主要是解决思想范畴的问题，必须坚持和风细雨的方法，“团结——批评——团结”的方法，充分发动群众掀起思想革命运动的高潮，开展以批判个人主义和右倾保守思想为主要内容的又红又专的大辩论。
    最后，指示特别强调指出，第四阶段是整风运动获取全胜的决定性关键，是为正确地贯彻党的建设社会主义总路线奠定坚强思想基础的极为重要的阶段。各级党委的第一书记和各个部门的党组书记，一定要亲自挂帅，抓紧时间，具体安排，深入检查，促进运动迅速发展，特别是要大力加强薄弱环节，善始善终地把整风运动彻底搞好。任何强调工作忙，放弃领导，任其自流，虎头蛇尾，企图草率收兵的作法，都是极端错误和有害的，都是不重视政治思想工作的右倾思想的表现，应坚决反对。整风结束时，各单位领导应向群众总结这次整风运动的收获，订出必要的制度，改进工作，并把干部劳动锻炼作为一种制度坚持下去，巩固整风成果。为了保持和发扬整风运动所带来的革命精神，各级领导机关可以把领导整风运动的一套工作方法和组织形式（例如整风办公室）保留下来，运用到日常工作中去，解决整风中尚未解决的遗留问题，以群众运动的方法来领导机关的经常工作。
    各单位应加强领导  使整风获得全胜
    本报讯　在6月27日，内蒙古党委召集了自治区直属机关负责同志会议，王铎书记对自治区直属机关第四阶段整风作了布置。王铎书记说：第四阶段是整风最后一个阶段，也是整风取得全胜的一个重要阶段，各单位必须加强对这一阶段的领导，把整风进行到底，绝不能虎头蛇尾。他说，前一阶段整风主要解决了带有共同性的问题，解决了敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的问题，转变了领导作风，克服了右倾保守思想和三风五气，促进了生产和工作的大跃进。但是这一阶段整风对每个干部的思想作风并没有进行系统的检查和批判。因此第四阶段的任务是：继续揭发和批判官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义，即揭发和批判在执行党的路线、党的政策方面的右倾保守思想和教条主义、经验主义倾向；揭发和批判个人主义、本位主义、自由主义、民族主义等错误思想，以便提高全体党员和干部的共产主义思想水平。这一阶段的特点是一个群众性的自觉的思想革命运动，要求每个人都根据自己的具体情况，检查自己的思想错误，拔掉白旗、插上红旗，制订个人跃进规划，达到又红又专的目的。
    第四阶段整风的步骤应该是：首先要组织干部学习指定的整风文件，进一步明确、站稳阶级立场，坚持党的社会主义建设总路线，掌握马克思、列宁主义的思想方法。其次，要开展批评与自我批评，通过交心、谈心检查自己。在方式上可以采取小型座谈会和大字报形式。如果发现重大原则性的意见分歧，可以在一定范围内进行辩论，以统一认识，加强团结，提高觉悟，改进工作。在辩论和批判中，必须坚持从团结出发，经过批评达到团结的原则，必须坚持既严肃认真又和风细雨的原则。第三，每个人都要写出自我反省总结，通过互相传阅个别交谈的方式征求意见，取得别的同志的帮助。思想总结内容，大体是，整风运动中的思想收获，对两条道路斗争的认识，个人资产阶级思想和领导作风、工作方法的检查等。第四，在思想总结的基础上要制订个人又红又专的规划。整风结束后每个单位都要做出这次整风运动的总结，制订经常的政治思想教育制度，巩固整风成果。
