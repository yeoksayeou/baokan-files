Don't Allow the US and Britain to Evade a Summit Conference
Public Opinion in Various Countries Demands a Swift Resolution to the Middle East Crisis
French Press Demands Western Nations Immediately Propose Date and Location for Meeting
Xinhua News Agency, July 29th - According to TASS, Paris, July 29th: Newspapers are extensively commenting on the letters exchanged between Khrushchev and Eisenhower, Macmillan, and De Gaulle. Many newspapers emphasize the swift response from the head of the Soviet government, and point out that Khrushchev agreed with De Gaulle's proposal to hold a high-level conference in a European city. "Paris Daily" notes that Paris is apparently very pleased with the tone of Khrushchev's letter.

Some newspapers, including the Socialist "Paris People's Paper," attempt to distort the Soviet position, publishing comments with ulterior motives. As usual, "Paris People's Paper" described Khrushchev's letter as "propaganda." The right-wing newspaper "Le Figaro" insists that the Soviet Union wants to sow discord among Western countries. Another right-wing socialist newspaper, "Paris Daily," opposed this view, writing, "This assessment is incorrect; this assessment is based on a psychological error."

"New Republic" believes that Eisenhower should now express his agreement. The newspaper writes, "It is clear that regardless of those who raise various additional conditions, express opposition, and harbor various plans, a high-level conference must be held. It is no longer possible to obstruct the holding of such a conference."

"Free Poitou" writes, "It is difficult to imagine that Macmillan and Eisenhower can now refuse the plan approved by the two main participants in the high-level conference."

"Paris-Normandy" writes, "Washington, Paris, and London should immediately propose a date and location for the meeting."

    不许美英逃避首脑会议
    各国舆论要求迅速解决中东危机
    法报要求西方各国
    立即提出开会日期和地点
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社巴黎29日讯：报纸广泛评论赫鲁晓夫同艾森豪威尔、麦克米伦和戴高乐交换的信件。许多报纸强调指出苏联政府首脑的迅速的答复，并且指出，赫鲁晓夫同意戴高乐主张在欧洲某个城市举行高级会议的意见。“巴黎日报”指出，巴黎显然对赫鲁晓夫信件的语气很感到满意。
    有些报纸，其中包括社会党的“巴黎人民报”，企图歪曲苏联的立场，发表别有用心的评论，“巴黎人民报”像往常一样，把赫鲁晓夫的信件说成是“宣传”。右翼的报纸“费加罗报”硬说苏联想离间西方国家。另一家右翼社会党的报纸“巴黎日报”反对这种说法，它写道，“这种估计是不正确的，这种估计是建立在心理的错误上。”
      “新共和国报”认为，现在艾森豪威尔应该表示同意了。报纸写道，“很显然，不管这些人或那些人提出种种附加条件，表示反对和抱着种种打算，但是高级会议一定要举行。再不能阻挠这种会议的举行了”。
    “自由的波图瓦报”写道，“很难设想，麦克米伦和艾森豪威尔现在可以拒绝高级会议的两个主要参加者所赞成的方案”。
      “巴黎——诺曼底报”写道，“华盛顿、巴黎和伦敦应该立即提出举行会议的日期和地点”。
