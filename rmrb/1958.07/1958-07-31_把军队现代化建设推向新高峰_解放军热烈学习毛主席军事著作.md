    Push the Modernization of the Army to a New Peak
    The PLA Enthusiastically Studies Chairman Mao's Military Writings
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th - The People's Liberation Army's various units and military academies are launching a wave of enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works and military thought. From generals to soldiers, everyone is working hard to combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's specific military practice, holding high the red banner of Chairman Mao's military doctrine, and pushing the modernization of our army to a new peak.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army has grown and become strong under the guidance of Chairman Mao's military thought, and has always attached great importance to studying Chairman Mao's works and implementing Chairman Mao's military thought. Since the rectification campaign, various units and military academies have launched a wave of enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's military writings on a wider and deeper scale. The leading organs of many units have organized study groups headed by military and political leaders. Many units have also adopted the form of training camps to concentrate cadres for study. Some units have also organized Chairman Mao's works research committees or research groups. The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice stipulating that eleven articles in Chairman Mao's works, such as "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" and "On Protracted War," are required reading for army cadres. A theoretical team of more than 600 people stationed in Beijing has been formed. Many leading organs are preparing to gradually publish theoretical publications. The General Political Department is also preparing to establish a theoretical team of tens of thousands of people throughout the army in two or three years.
    In the study, all units emphasize that Chairman Mao's thought should be used as a guide to study and improve current work and solve practical problems. Many units study while improving their work. The Military Academy, the Senior Infantry School, and many other colleges and universities are using Chairman Mao's military thought as a guide, based on our army's glorious tradition, army building experience, combat experience, and the actual situation, to absorb the advanced experience of the Soviet army and modern military science and technology, and compile new textbooks suitable for our army's needs. In the study, many units have paid more attention to strengthening the collective leadership of the Party committee, strengthening political and ideological work, and more consciously promoting democracy and following the mass line. Because the troops have adhered to and carried forward the fine tradition of unity between the army and the people, all officers and soldiers support local construction and cherish the interests of the people with greater enthusiasm, and the relationship between the army and the people has become closer. In terms of training methods, the troops have also changed the past teaching method of "teachers lecturing and students listening." Now, teachers go to the students to "seek treasures," absorb the wisdom of the masses, enrich teaching content, and improve teaching methods. Methods such as free airing of views, debates, and big-character posters are used in the teaching process, which greatly improves the teaching effect. As a result of doing so, artillery units alone have produced a large number of "all-round artillery masters" and "excellent artillery regiments."

    把军队现代化建设推向新高峰
    解放军热烈学习毛主席军事著作
    新华社30日讯　中国人民解放军各部队、各军事院校正在展开学习毛主席的著作和军事思想的热潮。从将军到士兵，都在努力把马列主义的普遍真理同我国具体军事实践相结合，都在高举着毛主席军事学说的红旗，把我军现代化建设推向新的高峰。
    中国人民解放军是在毛主席的军事思想指导下成长壮大起来的，从来就极为重视学习毛主席的著作，贯彻毛主席的军事思想。整风运动以来，各部队、各军事院校，在更大的广度和深度范围内开展了学习毛主席军事著作的热潮。许多部队的领导机关都组织了以军政首长为首的学习小组。许多单位并采用集训队的方式把干部集中起来学习。有些单位还组织了毛主席著作研究委员会或研究小组。解放军总政治部在最近发出通知，规定以毛主席著作中的中国革命战争的战略问题、论持久战等十一篇文章为军队干部的必读文件。驻京部队六百多人的理论队伍已经组成。许多领导机关都准备逐步出版理论刊物。总政治部并且准备在两三年内在全军范围内建立一支上万人的理论队伍。
    各单位在学习中都非常强调要以毛主席的思想为指针来研究和改进当前工作，解决实际问题。许多单位都是一边学习，一边改进工作。军事学院、总高级步兵学校以及其它许多院校都正在以毛主席军事思想为指针，根据我军的光荣传统、建军经验、作战经验和现实情况，吸收苏联军队的先进经验和现代军事科学技术，编写适合我军需要的新的教材。许多单位在学习中，都更加注意加强党委集体领导，加强政治思想工作，更加自觉地发扬民主、走群众路线。由于部队坚持和发扬了军民一致的优良传统，全军官兵以更大的热情支援地方建设、爱护人民利益，军民关系也更加密切了。在训练方法上，各部队也改变了过去的“先生讲、学生听”的教学方法，现在教员纷纷到学员中“取宝”，吸取群众的智慧，丰富教学内容，改进教学方法，在教学过程中采用鸣放辩论和大字报的方法，大大提高了教学效果。仅炮兵部队这样做的结果，就出现了大批的“全能炮手师”“全优炮手团”。
