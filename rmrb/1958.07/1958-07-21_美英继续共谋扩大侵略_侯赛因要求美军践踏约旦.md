　　Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: Washington D.C. - The talks held in Washington D.C. between the United States and the United Kingdom to conspire to expand aggression in the Middle East have been repeatedly extended. Lloyd has decided to extend his stay in Washington for another day.

　　Sources reveal that Lloyd and Dulles have decided to refuse to withdraw the two countries' aggressive troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Moreover, they intend to further expand their aggressive activities against other Middle Eastern countries, including the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic.

　　At the same time, the U.S. government is preparing to send more armed forces to interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries and is stepping up preparations for expanding the war of aggression.

　　Following the invasion of Lebanon, the United States is attempting to use the so-called "invitation" as an excuse to send troops to invade Jordan.

　　Just as, on the eve of the landing of U.S. invading forces in Lebanon, Chamoun "requested" U.S. "aid" first, Jordan's King Hussein announced on the evening of the 19th that he had requested U.S. troops to enter Jordan. Hussein also shamelessly said, "We are looking forward to their arrival."

　　At a press conference, Hussein continued to call himself the "head of state" of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation, which had ceased to exist due to Iraq's declaration of withdrawal, and arrogantly clamored to use this "identity" to "restore peace and order" to the Republic of Iraq.

　　Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu also insisted at a press conference on the 18th that the government of the Republic of Iraq "does not exist at all" and described the "Iraqi-Jordanian Federation government" that Hussein clung to as the "only legitimate government."

　　A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman also said on the 19th that Hussein is still the "head of state" of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation.

    美英继续共谋扩大侵略
    侯赛因要求美军践踏约旦
    本报综合报道  据新华社20日讯：华盛顿消息：美英两国在华盛顿举行的共谋扩大侵略中东的会谈一再延长。劳埃德已经决定把他在华盛顿的逗留期限再延长一天。
    消息透露，劳埃德和杜勒斯已经决定拒绝从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退两国的侵略军队。而且还打算进一步扩大对中东其他国家，包括伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国的侵略活动。
    与此同时，美国政府正着手派遣更多的武装部队去干涉阿拉伯国家内政，并且加紧进行扩大侵略战争的准备工作。
    继侵入黎巴嫩之后，美国正企图利用所谓“应邀”的借口，出兵侵略约旦。
    就像在美国侵略军在黎巴嫩登陆前夕先由夏蒙“要求”美国“援助”一样，约旦国王侯赛因19日晚上宣布，他已经要求美军开进约旦。侯赛因还无耻地说，“我们期待着他们的到达”。
    侯赛因在记者招待会上，还继续自封为由于伊拉克宣布退出而早已不存在的伊拉克—约旦联邦的“元首”，并且狂妄叫嚷要以这个“身份”去伊拉克共和国“恢复和平和秩序”。
    土耳其外交部长佐鲁18日在记者招待会上，也硬说伊拉克共和国政府“根本不存在”，并把侯赛因死抱住的“伊拉克—约旦联邦政府”说成是“唯一合法的政府”。
    巴基斯坦外交部发言人19日也说，侯赛因仍然是伊拉克—约旦联邦的“元首”。
