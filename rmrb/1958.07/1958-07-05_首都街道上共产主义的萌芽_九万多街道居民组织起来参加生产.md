    首都街道上共产主义的萌芽
    九万多街道居民组织起来参加生产
    新华社4日讯　北京市已经有九万多名街道居民组织起来参加劳动生产，其中绝大多数是家庭妇女。她们在街道上大办缝纫、理发室、淋浴室、食堂等服务性行业，并且为一些工厂、企业担负辅助性劳动。
    中共北京市委书记处书记、北京市副市长张友渔今天在全市街道居民建设社会主义跃进大会上说，建设社会主义，已成为北京市广大居民自觉的行动，街道工作出现了以组织生产和为生产服务为中心的全面跃进新局面。他说，这是首都街道上共产主义的萌芽。
    为了解放妇女劳动力，全市各街道托儿组织已经收托了十七万五千多名儿童，办起了二十三个街道食堂。在今天的跃进大会上，宣武区、朝阳区、东城区等各个区的代表汇报了他们组织起来参加生产和各种生活服务事业的生动事例。东城区桃条办事处第五居民委员会有一百八十二人已经全部组织起来参加了缝纫、装订等生产。同时，成立了托儿所、集体食堂、儿童理发室、洗衣组、缝纫组等。宣武区广惠寺办事处第二居民委员会居民们到废品门市部买了旧双轮机，苦战一夜，安装了十七台脚蹬麻绳机，现在已全部投入生产。
    北京市街道居民社会主义建设跃进大会是3日、4日在北京体育馆召开的。全国妇联副主席李德全曾到会祝贺。
