Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 18th: In order to conspire with the United States to further aggression against the Middle East, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd arrived in Washington by plane on the morning of the 17th. That evening, he held talks with US President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles.

A written statement read by White House Press Secretary Hagerty after the three-way meeting said that both sides had "comprehensively studied" the situation in the Middle East and had reached "close agreement" on the armed intervention actions taken by the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan.

Before meeting with Eisenhower, Lloyd had already held a seven-hour-long talk with Dulles. It was revealed that the two sides formulated secret plans to take further actions from a military, political, and diplomatic standpoint to interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, especially to deal with the revolutionary regime in Iraq. Sources say the US and Britain also intend to use Jordan to attack Iraq.

It is reported that one of the purposes of Lloyd's visit is to agree with the US State Department on the specific scope of division of labor between the two countries in their aggressive activities in the Middle East. The US State Department's statement on the 17th supporting the entry of British aggressor troops into Jordan is the first result of the US-British talks.

News from Paris says that French officials are very dissatisfied with France being excluded from this US-British secret consultation on aggression plans. French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville warned in a speech to the "American Club" in Paris on the 17th that a lack of coordination between US and French policies would be "very dangerous."

    美英策划对中东扩大侵略
    劳埃德同美当局举行会议
    新华社18日讯  华盛顿消息：为了同美国策划进一步侵略中东的阴谋，英国外交大臣劳埃德17日上午乘飞机到达华盛顿。当天傍晚他就同美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯举行了会谈。
    由白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂在三人会谈后宣读的一份书面声明说，会谈双方“全面研究”了中东的局势，并且对美、英两国在黎巴嫩和约旦两国所采取的武装干涉行动取得了“密切的意见一致”。
    在同艾森豪威尔会谈以前，劳埃德已经先同杜勒斯举行了七小时的长谈。据透露，会谈中双方拟定了从军事上，政治上和外交上采取进一步的行动来干涉中东各国人民的内政，特别是对付伊拉克革命政权的秘密计划。有消息说，美英还有意利用约旦去进攻伊拉克。
    据报道，劳埃德此行的一个目的是要同美国国务院商定两国在侵略中东活动中的具体分工范围。美国国务院17日发表的支持英侵略军进入约旦的声明就是美英会谈的第一个结果。
    从巴黎传来的消息说，法国官方对法国被排斥在这次美英密商侵略计划的会谈之外感到很不满意。法国外交部长德姆维尔17日在巴黎“美国人俱乐部”讲话时警告说，美法两国的政策缺乏协调将是“非常危险的”。
