Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: The people of the capital began a week-long blitz on July 25th to eradicate mosquitoes and flies, focusing on food and environmental hygiene, continuing the repeated sweep against the four pests during the current mosquito and fly breeding season.

On July 25th, the people of the entire Dongcheng District acted in unison, using "666" insecticide smoke to fumigate indoor mosquitoes. The district established a mosquito and fly eradication command headquarters on the 23rd, commanded by Zhou Ren, First Secretary of the Dongcheng District Committee of the Communist Party of China, with each street office also establishing sub-command headquarters. Other districts have either held mobilization meetings or are preparing deployments.

During the blitz campaign from July 25th to the end of July, Beijing will mobilize the entire population and universally adopt a comprehensive approach combining drug fumigation, spraying, wall brushing, swatting, and trapping to eliminate mosquitoes and flies. It will also thoroughly clean toilets, universally sprinkle "666" insecticide powder on all toilet pits and manure ponds, and tightly cover or cover with soil. In addition, it will overturn pots and jars to eliminate standing water, and ditches and depressions will be combined with fertilizer accumulation to salvage weeds and repair embankments. Non-staple food stores, restaurants, and collective canteens must strictly ensure cleanliness and freedom from flies, and must not sell or prepare rotten or deteriorated food. All the people of the city should jointly maintain the cleanliness of streets and public places, not spit anywhere, and not litter with fruit peels.

Under the leadership of the Party and the efforts of the people of the city, the patriotic health campaign in the capital, centered on eliminating the four pests, has achieved remarkable results: a large number of sparrows and mice have been eliminated, and more than 95% of the stagnant water pits and depressions in the urban area have been filled and utilized, and most of the toilets in urban and rural areas have been rebuilt. However, at present, some units only focus on production leaps and do not pay attention to hygiene; some units have developed a slack and麻木 (má mù) attitude towards hygiene work, so mosquitoes and flies have bred again in some places, especially in the non-staple food and catering industries, due to the influence of the season, the increase of rotten and deteriorated food has made the breeding of flies more serious. The Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee decided at an enlarged meeting held on the 24th to fight hard for seven days, vigorously eliminate mosquitoes and flies, and vigorously promote food and environmental hygiene. In August, the masses will be mobilized to conduct a city-wide health inspection, launch a red flag and pull out white flag campaign in health work, eliminate dead corners; in September, another city-wide clean-up and inspection and evaluation will be carried out to basically achieve "four withouts" before National Day.

### 全民动员　决不松劲  首都人民扫荡蚊蝇

    全民动员　决不松劲
    首都人民扫荡蚊蝇
    新华社25日讯　25日，首都人民开始了一个扑灭蚊蝇、大搞饮食卫生和环境卫生的突击运动周，趁目前蚊蝇孳生的季节，继续向四害反复扫荡。
    25日，东城区全区人民一致行动，用“六六六”杀虫药烟熏室内的蚊子。这个区在23日成立了灭蚊蝇战斗指挥部，由中共东城区委第一书记周仁任指挥，各街道办事处也都成立了分指挥部。其他区有的已经开大会进行动员或准备布置。
    在从25日到7月底的突击运动期间，北京市将全民动员，普遍采用药物烟熏、喷撒、刷墙、扑打和诱扑相结合的综合措施消灭蚊蝇；还要彻底清扫厕所，对所有厕坑、粪稀池普遍撒“六六六”杀虫粉，严密加盖或撒土；另外还要翻盆倒罐清除积水，沟洼等处要结合积肥打捞杂草和修整堤岸。副食品商店、饭馆和集体食堂要作到严格保证清洁无蝇，不卖不作腐烂变质的食品。全市人民共同维护街道公共场所的清洁，不随地吐痰、不乱扔瓜果皮。
    首都以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动在党的领导和全市人民的努力下，已经取得了显著的成绩：消灭了大量的麻雀和老鼠，城区的积水坑洼已有95％以上被填垫和利用，城乡大多数厕所已经改建。但是目前有的单位存在着只搞生产跃进、不搞卫生的情况；有些单位产生了对卫生工作的松劲麻痹的情绪，因而蚊蝇又在若干地方孳生了，特别是在副食品、饮食行业中，由于季节的影响，腐烂变质食物增多，蝇类的孳生就更严重。北京市爱国卫生运动委员会在24日召开的扩大会议上决定大战七天，大力扑灭蚊蝇，大搞饮食和环境卫生。在8月里发动群众进行全市卫生大检查，在卫生工作中展开插红旗、拔白旗运动，消灭死角；9月份再进行一次全市的清洁大扫除和检查评比，在国庆节前基本上达到“四无”。
