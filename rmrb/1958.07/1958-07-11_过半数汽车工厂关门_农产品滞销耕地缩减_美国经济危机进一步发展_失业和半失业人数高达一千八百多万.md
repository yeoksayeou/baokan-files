Xinhua News Agency, New York, 10th: The American economic crisis is further developing, with large numbers of this year's graduates unable to find jobs.

According to announcements made by the Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor on the 8th, the number of unemployed in the United States in June increased by 533,000 compared to May, reaching a peak of 5,437,000. These two government departments believe that the surge in unemployment in June is due to the influx of large numbers of university and college graduates into the labor market, but they are unable to find work due to the economic downturn. The Department of Labor has estimated that the number of unemployed in the United States will continue to increase in the future.

According to trade union statistics, the number of underemployed in the United States recently reached 13 million, of which more than 8.2 million industrial workers worked only 15 to 34 hours per week, more than 3.2 million industrial workers worked only 1 to 14 hours per week, and another 1.5 million agricultural workers worked less than 34 hours per week.

With the increase in unemployment, the lives of the American people are becoming more difficult. In New York, the number of unemployed, hungry, and homeless people has increased to the highest record in seventeen years. In Detroit, capitalists are taking back thousands of household goods and homes previously purchased on installment plans by unemployed workers who are now unable to repay their loans. In every major industrial city, large crowds of people are lining up in front of unemployment relief centers and charities every day, waiting for relief.

In terms of industrial production, automobile production has recently plummeted. In the week ending on the 5th, due to poor sales (automobile sales in the first six months of this year decreased by about one-quarter compared to the first six months of last year, falling to the lowest level since 1952) and automobile companies changing car styles, nearly 60% of automobile factories closed down and did not start work. Production decreased by more than 62% compared to the previous week. But even so, the number of unsold new cars is still more than 700,000. The operating rate of the steel industry in the same week was only 52.7%. Railway freight volume, electricity production, and construction contracts have also decreased, while the number of bankruptcies of small and medium-sized enterprises is increasing.

In agriculture, the Department of Agriculture announced on the 8th that the cotton acreage on July 1st decreased by 12% compared to a year ago. According to American newspapers, due to the lack of sales outlets, the prices of many agricultural products are expected to plummet.

The recent situation in the American economy is somewhat different from the previous period. In May and June, due to some seasonal and accidental factors, American industrial production once rebounded. For example, the industrial production index in May rose from 126 in April (the average for 1947-1949 was 100) to 127, the operating rate of the steel industry once rose to 64.9%, and the number of unemployed also decreased.

When predicting the economic outlook, many American bourgeois newspapers and business people believe that the situation will continue to deteriorate. The National Association of Purchasing Agents pointed out: "None of the reports submitted by its members express any optimism about the near future. Most people believe that the recent business downturn will not improve significantly until the end of this year or the beginning of 1959."

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 10th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York: "Political Affairs," a publication of the Communist Party of the United States, published an article by Herman, a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, on the state of American agriculture. Herman pointed out that American agriculture has three characteristics: farmers are constantly and rapidly decreasing, there is a constant crisis of "overproduction," and the conditions of farmers and agricultural workers are constantly deteriorating.

In the period from 1933 to 1957, the American agricultural population decreased by more than half in percentage terms. Due to the increasing severity of the crisis, the rate at which the agricultural population flows into cities has been accelerating in recent years. From April 1956 to April 1957, the number of farmers decreased by 1,861,000. The Bureau of the Census pointed out that this was "the largest change in the agricultural population on record."

The growing difficulties in agriculture have led to a large number of bankruptcies of small farmers. The total number of farms decreased from 6,812,000 in 1934 to 4,783,000 in 1954 (the most recent statistic).

Farmers' incomes are constantly declining. In 1957, farmers' net income was 11.6 billion US dollars, while the highest income in 1947 was 16.9 billion US dollars. The proportion of farmers' income in the national income decreased from 9.1% in 1947 to 3.5% in 1957.

    过半数汽车工厂关门　农产品滞销耕地缩减
    美国经济危机进一步发展
    失业和半失业人数高达一千八百多万
    新华社10日讯　纽约消息：美国经济危机在进一步发展，今年毕业的大批学生找不到职业。
    据商务部和劳工部8日宣布，美国6月份的失业人数比5月份增加了五十三万三千人，达到五百四十三万七千人的高峰。这两个政府部门认为，6月份失业人数所以激增，是由于大批大学和专科学校的毕业生拥入劳动力市场，但是在企业不景气的情况下找不到工作。劳工部曾经估计，美国的失业人数以后还会进一步增加。
    据工会方面的统计，美国半失业的人数最近已高达一千三百万人，其中每周只工作十五到三十四小时的有八百二十多万产业工人，每周只工作一到十四小时的有三百二十多万产业工人，此外还有一百五十万农业工人每周工作不到三十四小时。
    随着失业的增加，美国人民的生活更加困苦了。在纽约，失业、挨饿和流浪街头的人数已增至十七年来的最高纪录。在底特律，资本家正在收回数以千计的失业工人以前用分期付款赊购但是现正无法偿还货款的家庭用品和房屋，在每一个重要工业城市，失业救济所和慈善机关门前每天都有大批人排成长蛇阵等待救济。
    在工业生产方面，汽车生产最近大跌。在5日结束的一个星期内，由于销售情况不佳（今年头六个月的汽车销售量比去年头六个月减少约四分之一，下降到1952年来的最低水平）和汽车公司改换汽车式样，差不多60％的汽车工厂关门没有开工，产量比前一周减少了62％以上。但是即使如此，卖不出去的新车数目仍有七十多万部。钢铁工业的开工率同一星期里也只有52.7％。铁路货运量、电力生产和建筑合同也减少了，而中小企业的破产数目正在增加。
    在农业方面，农业部8日宣布，棉花的耕种面积在7月1日比一年前减少了12％。据美国报刊说，由于产品缺乏销路，预料许多农产品的价格将要暴跌。
    美国经济最近这些情况同前一个时候是有所不同的。在5、6月间，由于一些季节性和偶然因素的影响，美国工业生产曾一度回升。例如5月份的工业生产指数从4月份的一百二十六（1947—1949年的平均数为一百）上升到一百二十七，钢铁业的开工率一度上升到64.9％，失业人数也一度减少。
    在预测经济前景时，美国许多资产阶级报刊和企业界人士均认为，情况还将继续恶化。全国采购代理商协会指出：“它的会员提出的报告没有一个是对最近的将来表示任何乐观的。大多数人认为，在今年年底或者1959年年初以前，最近企业的不景气状态不会有大起色”。
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：美国共产党的刊物“政治月刊”刊载了美国共产党全国委员会委员赫尔曼关于美国农业状况的一篇文章。赫尔曼指出，美国农业具有三个特征：农民在经常地、迅速地减少，经常性的“生产过剩”危机和农民及农业工人状况的不断恶化。
    在从1933年到1957年的这个期间，美国农业人口按百分比来说，减少了一半以上。由于危机不断尖锐化，近几年来农业人口流入城市的速度在不断加剧。从1956年4月到1957年4月，农民减少了一百八十六万一千人。国情普查局指出，这是“有纪录以来农业人口变化最大的一次”。
    农业中不断增长的困难，导致小农的大量破产。农场总数从1934年的六百八十一万二千个，缩减到1954年的四百七十八万三千个（这是最近一次的统计）。
    农民的收入正在不断下降。1957年农民的纯收入是一百一十六亿美元，而1947年的最高收入是一百六十九亿美元。农民收入在国民收入中的比例从1947年的9.1％下降到1957年的3.5％。
