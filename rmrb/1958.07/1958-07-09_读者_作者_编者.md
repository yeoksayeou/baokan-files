    Write News Shorter
    News should be shorter, which seems like a cliché. I think it is even more necessary to emphasize it today. If it is not short, how can it fully reflect the new era of "one day equals twenty years"? Readers always want to know more about the construction upsurges across the motherland. If the news is very long, and the newspaper's space is limited, first, it cannot reflect more of the new things in the Great Leap Forward; second, it may affect the timeliness of some news; and third, it affects the reader's interest in reading the newspaper. With these three harms, please pay more attention to this, reporters from the newspaper and Xinhua News Agency, and write news shorter.

    Cannot But Reflect on Myself
    I was particularly moved after reading the news and report in the People's Daily on June 25 about the leading comrades of central government organs participating in physical labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir. I further realized that in our great country, people are truly equal; I realized how great the Party is! After reading the news, I cannot but reflect on myself. I still lack a communist attitude towards labor. To despise physical labor is not to be a communist. I will definitely learn from our leaders in the future and seize every opportunity to actively participate in labor.

    Hope All Provinces Do This
    The eleven Sichuan folk songs introduced to the readers by Comrade Li Yaqun, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in the supplement of the People's Daily on June 26, are truly colorful and magnificent. I read them twice in one breath, and I can already recite several of them, such as "Thousands of Dragons, Ten Thousand Dragons" and "Startling the Taibai Star in the Sky." I love these precious folk songs. I hope that all provincial committees or folk song sorting groups can do the same, selecting some of the best and most exciting folk songs from each province and introducing them to the readers of the People's Daily.

    This Title is Inappropriate
    The title of the People's Daily editorial on June 3 was "Marching Towards the Technological Revolution." This title is inappropriate. If we say "Marching Towards Technology," the object of the march is "technology." Now saying "Marching Towards the Technological Revolution," isn't the object of the march "the technological revolution"? Literally speaking, it seems like it is "revolutionizing" the "technological revolution." The content of the editorial is obviously not this meaning. Therefore, this title is inappropriate.
  Shi Jianming, Qiqihar Animal Husbandry and Veterinary School
      (Editor's note: This reader's opinion is correct. The phrase "Marching Towards the Technological Revolution" is inappropriate.)

    About "Calculating Success by the Day"
    Some readers wrote to ask: In Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, a passage from the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee was quoted, in which the phrase "计日程功 (jì rì chéng gōng)" was used. What does this mean? Is the character "程 (chéng)" wrong?
    Regarding this question, a brief reply is as follows: "计日程功 (jì rì chéng gōng)" is an idiom, which means that the progress can be measured on a daily basis. The character "程 (chéng)" here is a verb.

        Worthy of Promotion
    The People's Daily has recently often published some folk songs related to news on the news page, such as those about publicizing the general line and singing about wheat harvesting. I think this approach is very good, not only vividly reflecting the heroic labor and happy life of the workers and peasants, but also increasing the reader's interest and promoting the further development of the new "national style." Therefore, it is worthy of being promoted and popularized.

    把新闻写短些
    新闻要短些，似乎是老生常谈。我认为今天更有强调的必要。不短的话，怎能充分反映“一天等于二十年”的新时代？读者总想多知道些祖国各地建设高潮中的面貌。如果新闻很长，报纸篇幅有限，一是不能更多地反映大跃进中的新事物；二是可能影响某些新闻的时间性；三是影响读者看报的兴趣。有这三害，请报社和新华社的记者多多注意，把新闻写短些。

    不能不反省自己
    看了6月25日人民日报登的中央机关领导同志在十三陵水库参加体力劳动的消息和通讯，特别感动。我进一步认识到在我们的伟大国家里，人和人是真正平等的；认识到党是多么伟大！看了消息后，我不能不反省自己。我对待劳动仍然缺少共产主义的态度。轻视体力劳动就不是共产主义者。我今后一定向我们的领袖学习，抓住一切机会积极参加劳动。

    希望各省都这样作
    中共四川省委宣传部副部长李亚群同志在6月26日人民日报副刊上向读者介绍的十一首四川民歌，真是色彩缤纷，气势磅礴。我一口气读了两遍，有几首如“千条龙，万条龙”、“惊动天上太白星”，都能背诵了。我爱这些珍贵的民歌。我希望各省委或各省民歌整理小组都能这样做，把各省最好的民歌挑选出一些最精采的，介绍给人民日报的读者。

    这个标题不妥当
    6月3日人民日报社论的标题是“向技术革命进军”，这个标题不妥当。如果说“向技术进军”，进军的对象就是“技术”。现在说“向技术革命进军”，进军的对象不就是“技术革命”了吗？从字面上讲，好像是要“革”“技术革命”的“命”。社论的内容显然不是这个意思。因此，这个标题是不妥当的。
  齐齐哈尔畜牧兽医学校  石剑鸣
      （编者按：读者这个意见是正确的。“向技术革命进军”的提法是不妥的。）
    关于“计日程功”
    有些读者来信问：刘少奇同志向党的“八大”二次会议所作的报告中，引用了七届二中全会决议的一段话，其中“计日程功”一语是什么意思？“程”字是否错了？
    关于这个问题，简复如下：“计日程功”是一句成语，就是可以按日测量进展的结果的意思。“程”字在这里是动词。

        值得推广
    人民日报最近常常在新闻版上刊登一些和新闻有关的民歌，如关于宣传总路线和歌唱麦收的。我认为这种做法很好，不但生动地反映了工农群众豪迈的劳动和幸福的生活，还能增加读者的兴趣，促进新“国风”的进一步发展。因此是值得提倡、推广的。
