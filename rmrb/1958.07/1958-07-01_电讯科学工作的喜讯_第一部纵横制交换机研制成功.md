    Good News in Telecommunications Science
    First Crossbar Exchange Successfully Developed
    (Our newspaper reports) The Post and Telecommunications Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has completed ahead of schedule, as a gift to the Party's birthday on "July 1st," China's first 100-line crossbar automatic telephone exchange and a 24-channel microwave machine. At the same time, a simple three-channel carrier telephone, a simple facsimile telegraph for rural use, and a 150 MHz ultra-high frequency transceiver, among other communication equipment, have also been completed. The successful development of this equipment once again proves that we can quickly climb to the highest peak of world science. For example, the 100-line crossbar automatic telephone exchange and the 24-channel microwave machine require a high level of technology and craftsmanship, which China had not previously possessed, but now does.
    The development of this equipment was originally scheduled to be completed in 1962, but now it only took two months from design to assembly. There were no prototypes or sufficient data available for reference in the design. For example, the crossbar switch in the 100-line crossbar system was designed based only on a blurry photograph from a Swedish sample, and the circuit of the exchange was designed after painstakingly studying a simplified relay diagram from a Soviet manual day and night. Last year, when Japan designed a similar circuit, they had a complete set of American materials and it took six engineers four and a half months, while we only spent twenty days.
    These achievements will soon be exhibited in Beijing. (Ling Xun)

    电讯科学工作的喜讯
    第一部纵横制交换机研制成功
    本报讯　邮电部邮电科学研究院，提前完成了向党的生日“七一”献礼的我国第一部100门纵横制自动电话交换机和24路微波机，与此同时完成的还有简易三路载波电话机、乡村用的简易传真电报机以及150兆周特高频收发讯机等通讯设备。这些设备的研制成功，又一次证明了我们完全可以迅速地攀登上世界科学的最高峰。如100门的纵横制自动电话交换机和24路微波机，它要求有高度的技术和工艺水平，以前中国还没有过，但是现在已经有了。
    这些设备的研制，原定1962年才能完成的，而现在从设计到装配只用了两个月的时间。在设计中并没有任何样机和足够的资料可供参考。如100门纵横制中的纵横接线器只是根据瑞典样本上一张模糊的照片，交换机的电路只是参照苏联说明书上一张简略的中继图，经夜以继日地苦心揣摩终于设计出来了。去年日本在设计类似电路时有全套齐备的美国资料，用了六个工程师花了四个半月的时间，而我们现在只仅仅用了二十天的时间。
    这些成就，不久就要在北京展出。　（凌迅）
