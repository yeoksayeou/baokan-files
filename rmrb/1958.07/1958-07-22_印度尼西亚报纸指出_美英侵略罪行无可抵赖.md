Xinhua News Agency report: Indonesian newspapers continue to publish commentaries, supporting the just struggle of the people of the Middle East and condemning the aggressive actions of the US and the UK.

	"Indonesia Torch" pointed out that the Indonesian people sympathize with the people of the Middle East.

	"East Star" said that in addition to quickly recognizing the Republic of Iraq, the Indonesian government must take swift international action to demand an emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly and put the issue of stopping the aggression of the United States and its partners in the Middle East on the agenda. The newspaper called on the Asian-African group to take a firm attitude towards the US aggression in the Middle East to avoid a wider war crisis.

	Indonesia's "People's Daily" wrote that the Republic of Iraq should be recognized first, and the US aggression should be protested. "People's Daily" said that the US's behavior violates the United Nations Charter and undermines the peaceful atmosphere between countries. This behavior is a colonialist crime that should be condemned.

	"Youth Daily" and "Indonesian Archipelago News" both pointed out that the struggle of the people of Iraq and Lebanon is not isolated, and they will receive support from the Indonesian people and people all over the world.

	"Indonesian Archipelago News" pointed out that Arabs and Indonesians are closely related. The newspaper said that the threat currently faced by the national independence movement in the Middle East is a test for the entire Asian-African nationalist forces.

	"Youth Daily" said that in the current situation, closer cooperation must be established between Asian and African countries. The newspaper also said that the support of the Soviet Union and China for the Arab people and the warning issued by President Nasser show that the Iraqi people are not isolated.

	The English-language "Indonesian Times" pointed out that the US-UK military occupation of Lebanon and Jordan is an act of aggression, which is undeniable. The newspaper said that the US and UK must withdraw their aggressor troops separately and dispel their arrogant ideas of suppressing Arab nationalism through military occupation.

    美英侵略罪行无可抵赖
    据新华社讯  印度尼西亚报纸继续发表评论，支持中东人民的正义斗争，谴责美英的侵略行动。
      “印度尼西亚火炬报”指出，印度尼西亚人民同情中东人民。
      “东星报”说，除了迅速承认伊拉克共和国之外，印度尼西亚政府必须在国际上迅速采取行动，要求召开联合国大会紧急会议，并且把制止美国和它的伙伴在中东的侵略的问题列入议程。这家报纸要求亚非集团对美国在中东的侵略行为采取坚决的态度，以避免更加广泛的战争危机。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”写道，首先应该承认伊拉克共和国和抗议美国的侵略行动。“人民日报”说，美国的行为违反了联合国宪章，并且破坏了各国之间的和平气氛，这种行为是应该加以谴责的殖民主义罪行。
    “青年报”和“印度尼西亚群岛报”一致指出，伊拉克和黎巴嫩人民的斗争并不是孤立的，他们将得到印度尼西亚人民和全世界各地人民的支持。
    “印度尼西亚群岛报”指出，阿拉伯人同印度尼西亚人是休戚相关的，报纸说，中东民族独立运动目前所面临的威胁就是对于整个亚非民族主义力量的考验。
    “青年报”说，在目前情况下，亚非国家之间必须建立起更加密切的合作。这家报纸又说，苏联和中国对阿拉伯人民的支持和纳赛尔总统发出的警告，都说明伊拉克人民并不是孤立的。
    英文的“印度尼西亚时报”指出，美英对黎巴嫩和约旦的军事占领是侵略行为，这是无可抵赖的。报纸说，美英必须分别撤出它们的侵略军，并且打消它们的企图通过军事占领来压制阿拉伯民族主义的狂妄想法。
