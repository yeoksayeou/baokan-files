    “Southern Breeze Blows, Wheat Turns Golden; Ranks of Youth and Strong Are No Longer Illiterate”
    Nine Million Illiterates in Shandong Enrolled in School
    (Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 13th) Since last winter, the anti-illiteracy campaign has been vigorously unfolding throughout Shandong Province. As of now, the number of illiterates enrolled in schools has reached over nine million, accounting for 82.7% of the total number of illiterates to be eliminated. Twenty-eight counties and cities have basically eliminated illiteracy. Shen County, the first in the province to eliminate illiteracy, is advancing towards the goal of cultural revolution set by the Party with a spirit of continuous revolution. The county has now universalized primary school education, with amateur junior high schools in every team, amateur middle schools in every two communes, and two classes of Red and Expert schools for township and commune cadres in each township. Shi Youxuan, over sixty years old, composed a clapper talk praising: “Southern breeze blows, wheat turns golden, ranks of youth and strong are no longer illiterate, thanks to Chairman Mao, thanks to the Communist Party; abundant food and clothing, beautiful scenery, faces like peach blossoms, full of joy; with culture, courage grows, like a fierce tiger with wings; write a letter to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to surpass England ahead of schedule."
    Currently, Shandong Province is accelerating the pace of eliminating illiteracy under the principle of centering on production and closely serving production, mobilizing illiterates who have not yet enrolled to enroll, and requiring the number of people graduating from illiteracy programs this year to reach nine million, basically completing the historical task of eliminating illiteracy in the first half of next year.

    “南风吹来麦金黄　队队青壮无文盲”
    山东九百万文盲入学
    据新华社济南13日电　自去冬以来，扫盲运动在山东全省蓬勃展开，截至现在为止，文盲入学人数已达九百多万，占应扫除文盲数的82.7％，已基本上扫除文盲的共有二十八个县市。全省最先扫除文盲的莘县正在以不断革命的精神，向党所提出的文化革命的目标飞跃前进。现在这个县已经普及了小学教育，队队设有业余高小，两个社就有一处业余中学，每个乡有两班乡社干部红专学校。六十多岁的石友宣编出快板赞美道：“南风吹来麦金黄，队队青壮无文盲，感谢毛主席，多亏共产党；丰衣足食风光好，人面桃花喜洋洋；有了文化长了胆，好比猛虎扎翅膀；写信报给毛主席，提前超过英国有保障”。
    目前，山东省在以生产为中心并紧紧服务于生产的原则下，加快扫盲速度，动员尚未入学的文盲入学，要求今年扫盲毕业的人数达到九百万，明年上半年基本上完成扫除文盲的历史任务。
