    Advanced Building Material: Lightweight Large Bricks
    (Reported by this newspaper) Li Peiji, a 24-year-old youth technician from the Ceramic Materials Research Group of the Building Materials Research Office of the Building Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, with the assistance of the Second Commercial Department and the Beijing Third Construction Company, successfully trial-produced the world's advanced building material—lightweight large bricks—in three days.
    This lightweight brick is made by rapidly firing clay in a mold to a high temperature of about 1,150 degrees Celsius. This type of brick is large in volume but light in weight, with a bulk density of 400 to 900 kilograms per cubic meter. It is more than half the weight of the same amount of ordinary red bricks, can replace large-sized building blocks, and can be used as load-bearing walls. Moreover, its compressive strength is 8 to 12 times higher than that of foamed concrete; its thermal insulation and sound insulation performance are also equivalent to that of foamed concrete. Therefore, it can replace foamed concrete and save a lot of cement. For example, building a 9,000-ton cold storage facility, using this brick to replace foamed concrete can save 1,600 tons of cement. Since ordinary kilns can be slightly modified to fire this brick, it can be promoted in both urban and rural areas.

    先进建筑材料轻质大砖
    本报讯　建筑工程部建筑科学研究院建筑材料研究室陶质材料研究组二十四岁的青年技术员李培基，在第二商业部和北京第三建筑公司的协助下，三天内试制成功世界上先进的建筑材料——轻质大砖。
    这种轻质砖是用粘土放在模型中快速焙烧到高温摄氏一千一百五十度左右制成的。这种砖的体积大而轻，每立方公尺容重四百到九百公斤，比同量的普通红砖轻一半多，可以代替大型砌块砖，作承重垟用，而且它的受压强度比泡沫混凝土高八到十二倍；隔热隔音性能也相当于泡沫混凝土。因此它可以代替泡沫混凝土，节约大量水泥。例如建筑一个九千吨的冷库，用这种砖代替泡沫混凝土，就可以节省水泥一千六百吨。由于一般的土窑稍加改装便可焙烧这种砖，无论城乡都可推广。
