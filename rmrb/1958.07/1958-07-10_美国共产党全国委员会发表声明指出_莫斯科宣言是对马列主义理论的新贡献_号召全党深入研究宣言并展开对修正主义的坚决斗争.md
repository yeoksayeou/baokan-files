Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from New York: The American Communist Party’s official journal, "Political Affairs Monthly," published in its June issue a statement by the National Executive Committee of the American Communist Party "Concerning the (Moscow) Peace Declaration and the Declaration of the Twelve Communist Parties." The editors of "Political Affairs Monthly" stated in an editor's note that this statement was unanimously adopted by the National Executive Committee based on the resolution passed at the National Committee's February meeting. Since then, several significant developments have emerged, particularly regarding the negotiations for a summit meeting and the stance taken by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. These developments have added new significance to the Peace Declaration and the Declaration of the Twelve Communist Parties, and once again emphasize the importance of studying and disseminating these two documents.

The statement said: When representatives of sixty-four Communist Parties met in Moscow to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the first socialist republic and issued a joint peace declaration, they not only spoke of the ideals and lofty goals of those dedicated to the cause of socialism in various countries, but also expressed the hopes of all mankind. The American Communist Party, due to the undemocratic restrictive laws of the United States that still prohibit freedom of travel and political association, was unable to participate in these meetings. However, we welcome this call for peace adopted by the sixty-four Communist Parties and will strive to make this call known to the American people as part of our contribution to ending misunderstandings between the peoples of the East and West and strengthening friendship and cooperation between them.

As our Sixteenth National Convention also pointed out, the declaration states: "War is not inevitable, war can be prevented, and peace can be defended and consolidated." The existing new balance of power makes it possible for us to do this. Leading the peace camp are socialist countries—the Soviet Union, People's China, and the people's democracies of Europe and Asia. Standing with them are the countries of the Bandung Conference—a powerful new world force. And in capitalist countries, the masses of working people are a powerful force for peace.

However, it is also clear that the danger of war has not passed. Its source is: "...monopoly capital groups that have made huge fortunes in the two world wars and in the current arms race... The ruling groups in some capitalist countries, under pressure from monopoly capital, especially American monopoly capital, refuse proposals for disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and other measures to prevent new wars."

The statement pointed out: However, the declaration says that this danger can be overcome. The forces of peace can prevail. We welcome the call of the sixty-four parties to all people of goodwill around the world to demand an end to the Cold War, the prohibition of nuclear weapons and nuclear tests, the abolition of military blocs and foreign bases, and an end to imperialist conspiracies and military provocations. We support the final paragraph of the Peace Declaration's call. "Let countries with different social systems now compete with each other in developing peaceful science and peaceful technology. Let them prove their superiority not on the battlefield, but in the race for progress and for raising the people's living standards."

"We extend our hand to all people of goodwill. We want to use our joint strength to get rid of the burden of armaments on the shoulders of the people. We want to save the world from the threat of war, death, and destruction. Ahead of us is a bright and happy future for mankind on the road to progress."

We also reaffirm the correct argument of the declaration:

"Socialist countries do not want to impose their social and political systems on the people of any country by force. They firmly believe that socialism will inevitably triumph, but they also know that socialism cannot be transplanted from the outside; it should first be the result of the domestic struggle of the working class and all progressive forces in each country."

The statement added: We also welcome the declaration of the ruling parties of the socialist countries, the twelve Communist and Workers' Parties, considering this another proof of the socialist system's inherent enormous contribution to world peace and social progress.

Today, the Soviet Union, the pioneer of a new way of life without class exploitation, is no longer an isolated socialist country. Now, one-third of the world's people have freed themselves from the rule of capital and are building their future on a socialist basis. We welcome this development and consolidation of socialist society in many countries, which for the first time in the world has created a world system superior to capitalism—a reliable fortress of peace and freedom.

This historically significant declaration illustrates the high degree of unity achieved by the leading parties of these countries. The unity shown by these twelve Communist Parties, who are successfully leading their countries in building socialism, once again emphasizes that the national characteristics and development processes of each country cannot negate the basic lessons applicable to all countries that constitute the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism in the history and experience of the working class. On the contrary, the basis of the increasingly strengthened unity of the socialist forces around the world lies in recognizing the universal principles of communism while creatively applying these principles according to the specific conditions of each country.

The declaration of the twelve Communist Parties points out that the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union marked a great development in the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism adapted to the new conditions of our current era—the era of the world's transition from capitalism to socialism. In this regard, the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU put forward new possibilities for achieving peaceful coexistence and the peaceful path to socialism. The declaration of the twelve Communist Parties implements and further develops this development in Marxism-Leninism, thereby making a new and significant contribution to the development of Marxist-Leninist theory. Moreover, while affirming new developments, the declaration once again emphasizes that all those who hope to eliminate class exploitation and build socialism must abide by the principles of the scientific method of Marxism-Leninism. These methods and principles are developed from the objectively proven laws of social development from the experience of the world. Therefore, when talking about the key issues in the world labor movement and international cooperation in the struggle for peace, democracy, and freedom, the declaration emphasizes the extreme importance of launching a resolute struggle against revisionism and dogmatism.

The statement said: It is particularly noteworthy that this declaration makes contributions to promoting the struggle for peace. In estimating the international situation, including the aggressive imperialist forces, especially the "Cold War" policy continuously implemented by American monopoly capitalists, this declaration emphasizes that the struggle for peace is the main task currently facing all progressive mankind, especially communists and other advanced workers. Regarding this aspect, based on a comprehensive analysis of the profound changes in the balance of world power, this declaration emphasizes that the forces of peace have grown greatly and that it is practically possible to prevent war. To this end, the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries reiterate their adherence to the principles of proletarian internationalism and the principles of peaceful coexistence between the socialist and capitalist systems, and promote joint action on the widest possible scale with all forces that love peace and oppose war for the sake of peace.

The statement said: A year ago, at our party's Sixteenth National Convention, we American communists took steps to break completely with sectarian errors and dogmatic habits, because these things prevented us from keeping up with the changing world situation and made us unable to most effectively lead the American people's struggle for peace and greater social progress. In such a process, we also found that we must launch a resolute struggle against revisionism—against any practice that abandons our ideological foundation, which is rooted in the struggles and experiences of the working class in our country and around the world, and which connects us with the cause of working people everywhere.

The statement pointed out that in order to realize the party's program decided by the Sixteenth National Convention and later further developed, our party must strengthen itself politically and organizationally, expand the party's ties with the masses, and fully play its vanguard role in the great struggle for peace, work, civil rights, and democratic freedom in our country. To achieve this goal, we must systematically conduct a struggle against left-leaning sectarianism and right-leaning opportunism, against dogmatism and revisionism, to defend the party and the party's basic Marxist principles.

When conducting a deeper study and broader discussion of the facts of the United States as the basis for our conclusions, our party will find that the lessons learned from the experience of the international communist and working class movement are extremely important.

The statement concluded: The National Executive Committee of the American Communist Party calls on every department of our party organization to deeply study and systematically discuss the theoretical issues contained in the declaration of the twelve Communist Parties, and to publicize the historically significant achievements of the world's socialist regions reflected in it and its contribution to world peace.

Similarly, the National Executive Committee calls for the widest possible distribution of the Peace Declaration of the sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties, and for organizing discussions about this declaration within the party and among other advocates of peace. This will be an important contribution to the greatest national interests of the American people and the cause of world peace.

    美国共产党全国委员会发表声明指出
    莫斯科宣言是对马列主义理论的新贡献
    号召全党深入研究宣言并展开对修正主义的坚决斗争
    新华社8日讯  纽约消息：美国共产党机关刊“政治月刊”在6月份一期中，刊载了美国共产党全国执行委员会“关于（莫斯科）和平宣言和十二国共产党宣言”的声明。“政治月刊”编者在按语中说，这个声明是全国执行委员会根据全国委员会二月会议通过的决议一致通过的。从那时以来，出现了若干意义重大的事态发展，特别是关于最高级会议的谈判和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会所采取的立场，这些事态发展给和平宣言和十二国共产党宣言增加了新的意义，并且再次着重表明了研究和传播这两个文件的重要性。
    声明说：当六十四国共产党的代表利用纪念第一个社会主义共和国建国四十周年的机会，在莫斯科举行会议，并且发表一项联合和平宣言的时候，他们不仅讲出了各国献身于社会主义事业的人们的理想和崇高目的，而且也表达了全人类的希望。美国共产党由于仍然禁止旅行自由和政治结社自由的美国反民主的限制性的法律，没有能参加这些会议。但是我们欢迎六十四国共产党人所通过的这个和平号召，并且将设法让美国人民知道这个号召，作为我们对终止东西方各国人民之间的误解和巩固他们之间的友谊和合作的贡献的一部分。
    正如我们第十六次全国代表大会也指出过的，宣言说：“战争不是不可避免的，战争是可以防止的，和平是可以保卫住和巩固起来的。”现有的新的力量对比使我们有可能做到这一点。领导和平阵营的是社会主义国家——苏联、人民中国、欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家。同它们站在一起的有万隆会议的国家——一支强大的新的世界力量。而在资本主义国家里，劳动人民群众是一支拥护和平的有力的力量。
    但是，同时也很清楚，战争的危险还没有过去。它的来源是：“……热中于战争的和幻想战争的是在两次世界大战中、在目前的军备竞赛中大发横财的垄断资本集团……。一些资本主义国家的统治集团在垄断资本、尤其是美国垄断资本的压力下拒绝关于裁军、禁止核武器及其他防止新战争的措施等建议。”
    声明指出：然而，宣言说，这种危险是可以克服的。和平力量能够占上风。我们欢迎六十四国的党呼吁全世界一切善良的人们起来要求停止冷战、禁止核武器和核试验、废除军事集团和国外基地、结束帝国主义阴谋和军事挑衅的号召。我们支持和平宣言最后一段呼吁。“让社会制度不同的国家今后在发展和平科学，和平技术方面彼此展开竞赛吧。让它们不是在战场上，而是在争取进步、争取提高人民生活水平的竞赛中来证实自己的优越吧。
    “我们向一切善良的人们伸出手来。我们要用共同的力量来摆脱压在人民肩上的军备负担。我们要使世界免受战争、死亡和毁灭的威胁。我们的前面是走向进步的人类底光明和幸福的未来。”
    我们也要重申宣言的正确论点：
    “社会主义各国并不想用暴力把自己的社会和政治制度强加于任何一国人民。它们坚信，社会主义必然胜利，但是它们也知道，社会主义不能从外边移植，它应该首先是每个国家的工人阶级和一切进步力量进行国内斗争的结果。”
    声明又说：我们同样欢迎社会主义国家执政党，十二国共产党和工人党的宣言，认为这再一次证明了社会主义制度所固有的对世界和平和社会进步的巨大贡献。
    今天，没有阶级剥削的新的生活方式的先驱者苏联不再是一个孤立的社会主义国家了。现在，全世界三分之一的人民已经摆脱了资本的统治，并且正在社会主义的基础上建设他们的未来。我们欢迎社会主义社会在许多国家里的这种发展和巩固，这在世界上第一次创立了一个比资本主义高一级的世界体系——一个和平和自由的可靠堡垒。
    这项具有历史意义的宣言说明了这些国家的领导党所取得的高度团结一致。正在胜利地领导他们的国家建设社会主义的这十二个共产党所表现出来的团结，再一次着重说明每个国家的民族特点和发展过程并不能取消工人阶级的历史和经验里构成马克思列宁主义学说的对各国普遍适用的基本经验教训。相反，全世界社会主义力量日益加强的团结，其基础就在于承认共产主义的普遍原则，同时又创造性地根据每一个国家的具体条件来运用这些原则。
    十二国共产党的宣言指出，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，标志着与我们目前的时代——全世界从资本主义过渡到社会主义的时代的新条件相适应的、马克思列宁主义的理论和实践中的一个巨大发展。在这方面，苏共第二十次代表大会提出了实现和平共处和走向社会主义的和平道路的新的可能性。十二国共产党的宣言贯彻和进一步发展了马克思列宁主义中的这种发展，从而对马克思列宁主义理论的发展作出了新的重大的贡献。而且，宣言在肯定新的发展的同时又再次强调指出，一切希望消灭阶级剥削和建设社会主义的人都必须遵守马克思列宁主义的科学方法的原则。这些方法和原则是从全世界的经验不断加以证实的社会发展的客观法则发展出来的。因此，在谈到世界劳工运动和争取和平、民主、自由的国际合作中的关键问题的时候，宣言着重指出了对修正主义以及教条主义展开坚决斗争的极端重大的意义。
    声明说：特别值得指出的是这个宣言对于推进争取和平的斗争做出的贡献。在估计国际形势，包括侵略成性的帝国主义势力，特别是美国垄断资本家们继续执行的“冷战”政策的时候，这个宣言强调指出，争取和平的斗争是现在全体进步人类，首先是共产党人和其他先进的工人面临的主要任务。关于这方面，在全面分析世界力量对比的深刻变化的基础上，这个宣言强调指出，和平力量已经大大成长，已经有实际可能来防止战争。为此，社会主义国家的共产党和工人党重申它们遵守无产阶级国际主义的原则和社会主义制度和资本主义制度和平共处的原则，并且力促为了和平而在尽可能广泛的规模上同一切爱好和平和反对战争的力量一起采取联合行动。
    声明说：一年前，在我党第十六次全国代表大会上，我们美国共产党人采取了步骤同宗派主义的错误和教条主义的习气一刀两断，因为这些东西阻碍我们跟上变化的世界形势，使我们不能对于美国人民争取和平和更大的社会进步的斗争进行最有效的领导。在这样的过程中，我们也发觉必须对修正主义——对任何放弃我们的思想基础的做法展开坚决的斗争，这种思想基础是扎根在我国和全世界工人阶级的斗争和经验中的，它把我们同各地劳动人民的事业联系起来。
    声明指出，为了实现党第十六次代表大会决定的，后来又进一步加以发展的党的纲领，我们党必须在政治上和组织上加强自己，扩大党同群众的联系，充分发挥它在我国争取和平、工作、公民权利和民主自由的伟大斗争中的先锋作用。为了达到这个目的，我们必须有计划地进行反对左倾宗派主义和右倾机会主义、反对教条主义和修正主义的斗争，以保卫党和党的马克思主义的基本原则。
    在对于美国的实况进行更深入的研究和更广泛的讨论以作为我们下结论的基础的时候，我们的党将发现从国际共产主义和工人阶级运动经验中得出的教训是极为重要的。
    声明最后说：美国共产党全国执行委员会号召我们党组织的每一个部门深入研究和有计划地讨论十二国共产党宣言中包含的理论问题，宣传其中所反映的世界上的社会主义地区的具有历史意义的成就以及它对世界和平的贡献。
    同样，全国执行委员会号召最广泛地散发六十四个共产党和工人党的和平宣言，并且在党内和其他拥护和平的人士中间组织关于这个宣言的讨论。这将是一个有助于美国人民的最大民族利益和世界和平事业的重要贡献。
