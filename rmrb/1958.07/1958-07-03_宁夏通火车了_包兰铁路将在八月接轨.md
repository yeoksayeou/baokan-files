    Ningxia Now Has Trains
    Baotou-Lanzhou Railway to Connect in August
    Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 2nd: The southern section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway has crossed the Tengger Desert, and officially opened to traffic yesterday to Zhongwei County, Ningxia's future railway hub station. The northern section of the railway has also crossed the Sandao Kan Yellow River Bridge, with tracks laid to Shizuishan, Ningxia, one of China's new coal bases under construction.
    Yesterday, Zhongwei County and Shizuishan simultaneously held celebrations for the opening to traffic and track-laying. At 11:00 a.m., more than 10,000 people participated in the celebration meeting in Zhongwei County. When the train, adorned with colorful silk, slowly drove south after the ribbon-cutting, tens of thousands of people cheered, celebrating the first train service in the Ningxia region in history. More than 1,200 local Hui and Han people rode the train for the first time.
    The track-laying projects of the north and south sections of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway are both only a little over 100 kilometers away from Yinchuan. Now, the railway workers are advancing with even greater enthusiasm, striving to connect the tracks in Yinchuan in August this year.

    宁夏通火车了
    包兰铁路将在八月接轨
    据新华社银川2日电　包兰铁路南段火车越过腾格里大沙漠，昨天正式通车到宁夏未来的铁路枢纽站——中卫县。北段铁路也已跨过三道坎黄河大桥，铺轨到宁夏正在兴建的我国新的煤炭基地之一——石咀山。
    昨天，在中卫县和石咀山同时举行了庆祝通车和铺轨典礼。上午十一时，中卫县有一万多人参加庆祝大会。当挂着彩绸的列车在剪采以后徐徐向南驶去时，万人欢腾起来，欢庆宁夏地区有史以来第一次通了火车。有一千二百多名当地的回汉族人民，第一次坐上了火车。
    包兰铁路南北两段的铺轨工程，都距银川只有一百多公里了。现在，修路职工们正在以更大的干劲，向前挺进，争取今年8月份在银川接轨。
