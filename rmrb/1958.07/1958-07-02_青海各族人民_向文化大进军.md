    Qinghai People of All Nationalities
    March Towards Culture
    The farmers and herdsmen of all nationalities in Qinghai Province are marching towards culture with fiery revolutionary enthusiasm. At present, the number of people participating in literacy campaigns in agricultural and pastoral areas of the province has reached 312,700, accounting for 66 percent of the total number of illiterate young and middle-aged people in the province, and more than 62,700 people have shed their illiterate status.
    With the great leap forward in agricultural production, the vast number of male and female members of the communes in Qinghai's countryside are increasingly aware of the importance of learning culture. The past practice of "learning more when not busy, learning less when slightly busy, and not learning when very busy" has been replaced by a new trend of "learning when slightly busy, learning even when very busy, and learning even more when not busy; learning every day, learning every month, and persisting in learning continuously throughout the year." Not only are young and middle-aged people actively participating in learning, but older people are also actively requesting to learn. Their slogan is "Try every possible means and work hard to learn culture." Many farmers have word cards pasted on their stoves, bellows, wardrobes, flour jars, water vats... Some people even hold books and recite them on the way to and from the fields. Women write characters in front of the stove while cooking. Touching scenes of children teaching their fathers and daughters teaching their mothers are everywhere. Illiteracy-free teams and communes appear every day in various counties. Commune members describe this large-scale cultural learning movement as: in the past it was "visiting neighbors, quarreling, and chatting idly," now it is "reading newspapers, singing, and learning culture." In pastoral areas, the vigorous development of the socialist transformation movement and the beginning of experimental settled nomadism have also powerfully promoted the movement to learn culture.

    青海各族人民
    向文化大进军
    青海省各族农民、牧民以如火如荼的革命干劲向文化大进军。目前，全省农、牧业区参加扫盲学习的人数已达到三十一万二千七百多人，占全省青壮年文盲总数的百分之六十六，并且有六万二千七百多人摘掉了文盲帽子。
    随着农业生产的大跃进，青海农村广大男女社员日益感到学习文化的重要，过去“不忙多学，小忙少学，大忙不学”的办法，已被“小忙要学，大忙也要学，不忙更要学；天天学，月月学，一年四季坚持不断学”的新风气所代替。不但青壮年踊跃参加学习，老年人也积极要求学习。他们的口号是“千方百计想办法，苦干实干学文化”。许多农民家里的锅台上、风箱上、衣柜上、面缸上、水瓮上……都贴的有字片。有的人在来往田间的路上，还拿着书本子念。妇女们一边作饭，一边在灶前写字。子教父、女教母的动人情景到处皆是。各县的无盲队、社每日都有出现。社员们描绘这次声势浩大的学文化运动说：过去是“串门、吵架、拉闲话”，现在是“读报、唱歌、学文化”。在牧业区，由于社会主义改造运动的蓬勃发展和开始试行定居游牧，也有力地推动了学文化的运动。
