    Loves Reading Short Stories

    The short story "Crossing the Wall," written by author Ji Xuepei and published on the eighth page of the June 23rd issue, is novel in form, profound in style, and has a strong sense of life. It is a hymn praising the peasants in the Great Leap Forward. This short story aroused the interest of many people in our unit, and everyone drew spiritual nourishment from it. Why do comrades love this work so much? In addition to the lively, vivid, and engaging writing, it is also because it is short and can be read in a few minutes. This kind of short work is very suitable for publication in newspapers.

    爱读小小说
    6月23日第八版发表的作家吉学霈的小小说“越墙记”，形式新颖，笔调浑厚，有较浓厚的生活气息，是一首歌颂大跃进中的农民的赞美诗。这篇小小说在我们单位引起了很多人的兴趣，大家从中吸取了精神养料。为什么同志们这样喜爱这篇作品呢？除了小说写的活泼生动、引人入胜而外，还因为它短小，在几分钟的时间内就可以读完，这种短小的作品很适合于报纸刊载。
