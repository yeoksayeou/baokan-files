Editor's Note: From May 19th to July 29th, the "Communist Party Member" supplement of the Beijing Daily organized a discussion on "Should Communist Party Members Have Personal Aspirations?" The purpose of the discussion was to promote communist style, deeply criticize bourgeois individualism, help Party members correctly understand and treat the relationship between Party spirit and individuality, between the Party and the individual, thereby boosting morale, striving for advancement, and becoming a striving and promising tool of the Party, to struggle for the implementation of the Party's General Line and the realization of the great ideal of communism.

In this discussion, the Beijing Daily published more than thirty articles, focusing on what kind of aspirations a Communist Party member should have. In particular, a thorough criticism and struggle was carried out against Zhang Jiaren's fallacies, which opposed Party members becoming docile tools of the Party, and slandered Party members who were content to do whatever the Party decided as "having no ideals," "having no brains," "having no creativity," and "having no great ambitions in their lives." On July 29th, the Beijing Daily summarized this discussion.

The discussion on "Should Communist Party Members Have Personal Aspirations," launched in the "Communist Party Member" supplement of this newspaper, was a debate about the relationship between individuality and Party spirit, and the relationship between the individual and the Party. In this debate, the struggle between two worldviews and two stances was vividly reflected. One is the idealistic bourgeois individualist represented by Zhang Jiaren, who stands on the bourgeois position and observes problems from an idealistic viewpoint. They use the pretext of "liberating thought and promoting communist style" to exaggerate the "independence" of individuality and personal aspirations, to oppose individuality and personal aspirations to Party spirit and the needs of the Party, to place personal interests above the interests of the Party, and to place personal freedom above organizational discipline. In fact, the individuality they understand is only bourgeois individuality, not proletarian individuality; the Party spirit they understand is also bourgeois Party spirit, not proletarian Party spirit. They oppose Party members being tools of the Party, especially opposing Party members being docile tools of the Party. They slander Party members who are content to do whatever the Party tells them to do as people "having no ideals," "having no brains," "having no creativity," and "being mediocre." They attacked the Party very wildly, attempting to let the West wind prevail over the East wind, and the white flag prevail over the red flag. In sharp contrast to them is the red flag of the materialistic proletariat of the vast majority of Communist Party members. These comrades resolutely refuted the bourgeois individualistic idealistic views represented by Zhang Jiaren, defended the proletarian materialistic viewpoint, and defended the organizational principles of the Party. It can be said that this debate ended with the form of pulling out the white flag and inserting the red flag, with the East wind prevailing over the West wind.

Zhang Jiaren and others believe that Party members obeying the Party's allocation, and being content to do whatever the Party tells them to do, are "brainless" and "unpromising" tools, and arrogantly say that they look down on such Party members. We say that we are first and foremost tools. We are both masters and tools. This is a basic theoretical issue of Marxism-Leninism. This is precisely our fundamental difference with the bourgeoisie on the issue of the relationship between the individual and the collective. Please tell me, what are we if we are not tools? What should we do if we do not act as tools? Party members are tools, tools of the Party. In the final analysis, Party members and the Party are all tools, tools of the proletariat, tools of the people. The state is also a tool, a tool of the ruling class: the state of the exploiting classes is a tool of the minority of exploiters; our state is a tool of the entire people led by the working class. Every one of us, Party members, revolutionaries, chairmen, premiers, etc., are all tools.

Is it good to be a tool? It is very good. Is there any reason to say that being a tool is "brainless" and "unpromising," that is, saying that being a tool of the Party is a "disgraceful" "foolish" thing? All of our more than 12 million Party members are acting as tools, are they all "brainless" and "unpromising" "fools"? Our countless revolutionary martyrs were also tools of the Party, they shed their heads and sprinkled their blood for the cause of the Party and the revolutionary cause, advancing wave upon wave and sacrificing heroically, are they all "brainless" and "unpromising" "fools"? In the past, we were able to overthrow the three major enemies and establish the People's Republic of China. Now our Party is leading the people of the whole country in socialist construction that is "one day equals twenty years," and has achieved unprecedented great achievements, are they all done by some "brainless" and "unpromising" "fools"? What utter nonsense! But some people stubbornly refuse to admit that they are tools, stubbornly refuse to be this kind of "brainless" and "unpromising" "fool," then they are "brainy" and "promising," they are "smart" people, what do they want to do? They want to treat the Party as their tool, want to treat the Party as a car, they are the drivers, they want to climb on the head of the Party to drive the Party, instead of letting themselves be the car, be the tool, not letting the Party lead him and drive him. Just like Lenin criticized the Menshevik's opportunist thinking on organizational issues in the book "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back": "The Party organization, in their view, seems like a fierce and terrible 'factory,' the principle of part obeying the whole and the minority obeying the majority, in their view, seems like 'slave bondage'... They hear of division of labor under the central leadership, they utter pitiful and ridiculous howls against turning people into 'cogs and screws'... They hear someone mention the Party's organizational rules, they pretend to be disdainful... giving contemptuous... opinions, saying that it is entirely possible not to have rules." Listen, our "smart" people who oppose making Party members tools of the Party, and oppose making themselves tools and screws, how much they resemble the Mensheviks criticized by Lenin! In fact, these "smart" people who are unwilling to be tools, their minds are not so smart, their bones are not so hard, their souls are not so pure, their actions are not so glorious. Class society clearly exists, but these people, like all reactionary rulers, stubbornly deny the existence of classes; intellectuals in class society, either serve this class or serve that class, always acting as tools of a certain class, but they stubbornly deny this. Why do reactionary ruling classes desperately conceal these things? This is because they are afraid that the people will know this truth and will resist them and revolt against them. But those of us with serious bourgeois ideas also clamor along with them, as if the Party's tools are a plague, that must not be touched. In fact, are they not tools themselves? It's just that they are unaware or deliberately don't admit it. For their own selfish interests and enjoyment, aren't they rushing around like headless flies? For their own fame and status, aren't they bowing and scraping everywhere, diligently seeking them? For their own selfish interests, they are always under the throne of the bourgeoisie, prostrating and worshiping, pleading plaintively, and are willingly slaves of the bourgeoisie, fearing that they cannot get it. What else is this kind of person if not a tool of the bourgeoisie? We Communists are historical materialists, and therefore also "toolists." We are not like reactionary rulers and bourgeois individualists, we will never conceal these things, but we will talk about them loudly. Because this is an objective fact, this is the truth. In order to liberate ourselves, in order to build a better society, we need to consciously become tools of the Party and the people. "One for all, all for one," that is: I first become a tool, and then I become the master. This is the relationship between us as individuals and the collective. Bourgeois individualists are ashamed to be tools of the Party and the people, we take it as the greatest glory to be able to be tools of the Party and the people.

Some people say that it is okay to be a tool of the Party, but why must one be a docile tool of the Party? They feel that the term "docile tool of the Party" is very harsh, and they cannot accept it in their thinking and feelings. We say that since a Party member is a tool of the Party, there is the question of what kind of tool they should be. Should they be a docile tool or a naughty tool? Should they be an easy-to-drive tool or a difficult-to-drive tool? Of course, they should be a docile tool, an easy-to-drive tool. A loyal Communist Party member should serve the Party and the people wholeheartedly, hate what the Party hates, love what the Party loves, "fiercely browbeat the thousand pointing fingers" at the enemy, and "willingly be an ox for the children" for the Party and the people, be good at understanding the Party's intentions, diligently and conscientiously, and sometimes even be willing to go through fire and water to complete the tasks entrusted by the Party; be able to understand the feelings of the people, know the cold and warmth of the people, be concerned about the Party and the people's worries, be happy with the Party and the people's happiness, and be in sync with the Party and the people, just like a very sophisticated tool, which the Party finds very convenient to use, and very handy. Our countless martyrs and the vast number of Party members are like this, wherever the Party points, they rush to, even at the cost of their lives. Our Party relies on these loyal Party members to be invincible and overcome all obstacles, and go from victory to victory. But some people look down on these loyal Party members. They see these Party members being so docile and loyal to the Party, and they cannot accept it in their thinking and feelings. They believe that being a docile tool of the Party harms their "self-esteem" and harms their "aloofness." Therefore, they are always neither too close nor too distant from the Party, always half-believing and half-doubting what the Party says, and their relationship with the Party is always awkward and uncomfortable; when the Party asks them to do something, they always bargain and hesitate. If compared to a tool, it is also a broken tool, which is always out of sync and often malfunctions. Just think about it, how can such a person be a docile tool of the Party and the people, and how can they serve the Party and the people well? Their thinking and feelings are fundamentally not the thinking and feelings of the proletariat and the working people, but a kind of bourgeois thinking and feeling, and a serious ideological transformation must be carried out on this kind of person.

Some people say that if Party members become docile tools, they will become rigid, doing whatever they are told, hindering the发挥 of their personal creativity and talents. They oppose having a brain with being a docile tool, oppose consciously working with obeying the Party, saying that being a docile tool has no ideals, and cannot发挥 their creativity and talents; to have a brain and have creativity, one must adhere to personal aspirations and not be a docile tool. We say that in order to be a docile tool of the Party, it is necessary to 发挥 everyone's intelligence and wisdom, and 发挥 everyone's creativity and strengths. There are dead tools and live tools. A dead tool does not move unless pushed, and moves only when pushed, like a car, which does not move if it is not driven, and does not stop if it is not turned off. There are also live tools, people are live tools, not only do their bodies move, but their brains also move. Is it better for the brain to move more or less? Of course, it is better to move more. One must dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, dare to uphold the truth and correct mistakes, and go all out, aim high, achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and be proficient in one's business. The better the tool, the more it needs to be able to use its brain, be able to study problems, and be able to create boldly. 发挥ing everyone's creativity and talents and being a good docile tool are not only not contradictory, but also complement each other. One must be a docile tool of the Party, and also be a tool with high enthusiasm and great creativity. Only the ideals of communists are the greatest in the world, is there any ideal in the world greater than struggling for the cause of communism for life? Is there any Party member in the world who dares to do what predecessors have never done, and is more able to use their brains, more able to study, and more creative? Not to mention the distant past, just take the inventions and creations in various places since the Great Leap Forward, which one was not created by people who are willing to be docile tools of the Party and the people? Isn't the problem very clear?

So, does the Party still allow Party members to have personal aspirations? Some people say that it is not allowed at all, as long as there are, it is individualism, this statement is also incorrect. However, a Party member's personal aspirations are fundamentally different from the bourgeois individualist's aspirations of personal supremacy. A person is not individually independent, he is a person in society, a person in the collective, he has sociality and historicity. Especially a Communist Party member, he must first have Party spirit, that is, the class nature of the proletariat. Therefore, whether a Party member's personal aspirations are correct and can be realized depends on whether it plays a promoting role or a retarding role in society and history, and whether it promotes more or less. Promoting is good and progressive, retarding is bad or reactionary. Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Mao Zedong were promoters, and they promoted greatly. Some natural scientists who sent man-made satellites into the sky are also promoters, and they promoted a lot as well. Some people promote less. These are all considered promoters.

How to promote? This depends on the direction of historical development, and it depends on the direction in which the people are advancing. The wheel of history cannot be stopped. Whoever wants to be a promoter must advance along the direction of historical development and the direction of the people. If the direction is wrong, it is retarding, or reactionary, no matter how great the personal aspirations are, they will be shattered, at most be a Hitler or a Chiang Kai-shek, won't they still be discredited and notorious for thousands of years!

Our Party is a promoter. Our Party adheres to the direction of the people, the direction of historical progress, and the direction of revolution. And at the critical juncture of history, it can foresee, decide on the correct policies, and take correct measures. This is because our Party is a proletarian party, our Party has mastered Marxism-Leninism, and understands the laws of social development. This is something that no other party of any other class in history can do.

The direction of our Party is correct, and a Communist Party member should strive in this direction. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in the book "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists": "The interests and development of individual Party members are included in the interests and development of the Party. The success and victory of the Party's class is also the success and victory of Party members. Party members can only develop themselves in the struggle for the Party's development, success, and victory, and cannot strive for individual independent development away from the Party's development. Only with the Party's development, success, and victory can Party members develop themselves, otherwise Party members cannot develop." Facts have proven that whoever aligns their personal aspirations with the Party's direction, and sincerely strives in the direction pointed out by the Party, when the Party wins and the people win, the individual also wins. Otherwise, going against it and insisting on "independent" personal aspirations, the result is not wonderful, and some even take the road of opposing the Party and opposing the people.

Some people may think that those were things of the past, and it may not be the same now, right? We say that it is still the same now.

Today, the Party calls on everyone to engage in economic construction, technological revolution, and cultural revolution. The Party has transferred many people to engage in economic work, scientific and technological work, and cultural and educational work. Among them, many comrades have not done it at all before, and have not even envisioned it, but they responded to the Party's call, overcame difficulties, studied hard, and engaged in this work. As a result, they have become excellent vanguards and leaders in various construction posts.

Some people say that we are talking about personal aspirations here, we are talking about lofty ideals, we are talking about the future, and the past and present situations are not enough to learn from. Yes, we should see the future. What about the future? In a few years, China will become a communist society. In communist society, ordinary social division of labor, everyone can do it, everyone will farm, everyone will work; everyone can also specialize in several fields, will study science, will write articles..., becoming a "versatile hand." At that time, the boundary between mental laborers and manual laborers will disappear. Everyone is a manual laborer, and everyone is a mental laborer. At that time, the boundary between cities and villages will also disappear. Farmers will become workers, and workers will also become farmers. There will be many inventors at that time, who will gain people's respect; but at that time, no one can wag their tails and put on airs as an "expert," because everyone will be an ordinary laborer, and everyone will be an expert. This is the Party's aspiration, and it should also be the Party member's aspiration.

This is the inevitability of social and historical development. A Communist Party member, a revolutionary, if they can recognize and consciously obey this inevitability, they will definitely have their own development prospects, will realize their own aspirations, and will definitely feel free; otherwise, if they do not recognize this inevitability, or do not obey this inevitability, they will definitely not have their own development prospects, will not realize their own aspirations, and will definitely feel unfree.

Some people say that the direction pointed out by the Party is correct, but what if the Party organization assigns Party members to work inappropriately, or even makes mistakes? We say that this situation is possible, so our Party advocates that when assigning Party members to work, it should listen to Party members' personal opinions as much as possible, allow Party members to explain what they hope to do and what their strengths are, and the Party should also take care of them as much as possible. However, the allocation of work cannot be entirely based on the wishes of each Party member, but the most important thing is to be determined according to the needs of social and historical development, the needs of revolution and construction, that is, the needs of the Party. Because the revolutionary cause is a collective cause, and the collective cause must be carried out in a planned and organized manner. Socialist construction develops according to plan and proportionally. And individual wishes are relatively complex and diverse. Perhaps a certain revolutionary work requires a lot of people, but few are willing to do it; a certain revolutionary work requires few people, but many are willing to do it. Therefore, whether the Party organization's allocation of Party members to work is right or wrong, it must first be determined by the needs of the revolution. In the past revolutionary war period, the Party needed to engage in armed struggle, and Party members and revolutionaries who could not fight had to fight; today in the socialist construction period, the Party needs to engage in economic construction, and Party members and revolutionaries who cannot engage in economic construction must also engage in economic construction.

Some people say that I have mastered this line of work, but the Party transfers me to do something else. If I keep changing careers like this, what can I achieve, and what can I accomplish? We say that whether a person can achieve anything and whether they have accomplishments depends on whether they obey the needs of the Party and the needs of the revolution. Whatever the Party needs and whatever the revolution needs are all important work; making effective efforts for this important work not only promotes the development of social history, but also enables oneself to truly achieve something. Some comrades used to want to engage in chemistry, physics..., but during the revolutionary war period, they went to the mountains, and now they are engaged in this or that economic work, and they are doing a very good job. Mr. Lu Xun originally wanted to be a doctor, but later he felt that doctors could not save China at that time, so he engaged in literature that could fight against the enemy,... They have all changed careers, but can it be said that they have no accomplishments? Of course not. If they do not obey the needs of the revolution and do not change careers, they would at most be ordinary experts.

Some people, when they mention personal aspirations, just want to be technical experts. If the Party assigns him to do political work, he is passive, saying that those who do political work are "jack-of-all-trades" cadres, who are useless. We say that it is absolutely impossible to do without cadres who do political work. Technical experts are important, but political work cadres still have to take command. In revolution and construction, it is impossible to do without political command. What is political command? It is political leadership, what is political leadership? It is about class relations, about the relationship between people, about mutual relations, it is about looking at the situation, pointing out the direction, raising tasks, and thinking of ways. Without political command, without the leadership of politicians, technical experts will lose their direction and will "specialize" in the capitalist road. Politicians leading technical experts is a general rule. Political work cadres are indispensable. Obeying the Party's assignment to be a political work cadre is not only beneficial to the revolution, but also a supreme honor for oneself. Of course, cadres who do political work should be both red and expert, and cannot be only red but not expert. Because if one cannot be expert, one cannot be red in specific business.

As for whether Party members are allowed to have other interests besides their job after obeying the Party's assignment, we say that it is allowed within a certain limit. Because as long as it does not violate the Party's interests and does not hinder the completion of the work assigned by the Party, it is not a bad thing for Party members to have other interests. In the past, when we went to the mountains to fight guerrillas, couldn't some people write poetry and novels; today, when we are engaged in construction, can't some people also become amateur singers and radio enthusiasts. In the future, in communist society, we will not need to work eight hours a day, we can work for four or five hours, and we cannot all play for the rest of the time, can't we still study, research, and engage in side businesses.

From this discussion, who likes to emphasize personal aspirations, who opposes personal aspirations to the needs of the Party, who looks down on and is unwilling to be a docile tool of the Party? We see that it can only be said that it is people with serious bourgeois individualistic thoughts. Zhang Jiaren is a representative of this kind of person. They emphasize personal aspirations, emphasize personal ideals, and despise people who obey the Party's assignment and are willing to be docile tools of the Party, saying that these people "have no brains," "are unpromising," "are mediocre," and "have no great ambitions in their lives." They despise this and despise that, but they do not despise bourgeois individualism; they teach this and teach that, but they do not teach themselves that they should obey the collective interests and needs of 600 million people. They have raised a white flag, as if all Party members should learn from them, in fact, they are challenging all loyal Communist Party members. They want the West wind to prevail over the East wind, to overwhelm us. Just think, if all of our Party members were like them and became selfish individualists, what kind of Party members would they be? What kind of Party would a Party composed of such Party members be, what difference would it have from the heinous Kuomintang?

From the above analysis in this article, what these people advocate, whether it is aspirations, ideals, creativity, or talents, has its own set of bourgeois interpretations, which is fundamentally opposite to the aspirations, ideals, creativity, and talents advocated by our Party. No matter how high-sounding they speak, when we uncover it, it is just a pile of bourgeois junk. They are selfish and extreme individualists, they are people who pursue low-level tastes. Those who are truly "brainless," "unpromising," "mediocre," and "have no great ambitions in their lives" are precisely themselves. In the discussion, these people also seized on the phenomenon of some Party members in our Party who lacked vigor and were content with being in the middle to make a big fuss, in order to prove that their fallacies seemed to have a basis. Of course, it is not good for some Party members to lack vigor and be content with being in the middle, it is a shortcoming, and they should be criticized and educated, and they should be encouraged to go all out and aim high, but they should never emphasize personal aspirations and personal ideals. Most of these comrades can be educated. In fact, after the rectification campaign and under the shining light of the Party's General Line, many comrades have already swept away the twilight and are full of vigor, and they are fundamentally different from those bourgeois individualists. From the discussion, we can clearly see that those bourgeois individualists, under the guise of implementing the General Line, under the cover of beautiful words such as "displaying vigor, daring to think and dare to do," are peddling their bourgeois private goods. They are not advocating that people go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, that is, serve 600 million people wholeheartedly, and be docile tools of the Party, but are emphasizing personal aspirations of personal supremacy; they are not daring to think and dare to do according to the spirit of the General Line, but are thinking wildly according to their personal plans; they are not encouraging people to complete the Party's tasks wholeheartedly and vigorously, but are creating ideological confusion and demoralizing the people; they are not maintaining and strengthening the Party's unity, but are hindering and weakening the Party's unity; they are not guiding people to the right path, but are guiding people to the wrong path. In short, what they are advocating is not proletarian thought, but corrupt bourgeois thought. Therefore, this discussion is essentially a class struggle. Zhang Jiaren is a white flag representing bourgeois individualism declaring war on proletarian collectivism. The proletariat must resolutely struggle against it, pull out this white flag, and insert our red flag.

Of course, bourgeois individualistic thoughts cannot be completely eliminated through several discussions. Bourgeois individualists are always trying every means to show themselves everywhere, stirring up their evil winds, spreading their fallacies, and spreading their stench. We must improve our sense of smell and be good at identifying the direction of the wind. When we find an evil wind, we must resolutely resist it, when we find a white flag, we must resolutely pull it out, and insert proletarian red flags and communist red flags everywhere.

What kind of aspirations should a Communist Party member have? Any loyal Communist Party member should: go all out, aim high, be a striving and promising docile tool of the Party, and struggle for the implementation of the Party's General Line and the realization of the great ideal of communism. This is our conclusion.

    共产党员应该有什么样的志愿
    北京日报关于“共产党员应不应该有个人志愿”的讨论总结
    编者按　北京日报“共产党员”专刊从5月19日到7月29日，组织了一次关于“共产党员应不应该有个人志愿”的讨论。讨论的目的是为了提倡共产主义风格，深入批判资产阶级个人主义思想，帮助党员正确理解和对待党性和个性、党和个人的关系问题，从而鼓足干劲、力争上游，做一个党的奋发有为的工具，为贯彻执行党的总路线，为实现共产主义的伟大理想而奋斗。
    这次讨论，北京日报上先后发表了三十多篇文章，着重对共产党员应该有什么样的志愿进行了讨论。特别是针对张家仁提出的反对党员做党的驯服工具，污蔑党决定干什么就安心干什么的党员是“没有理想”、“没有头脑”、“没有创造性”、“生平无大志”等谬论，进行了彻底的批判和斗争。7月29日，北京日报对这次讨论作了总结。
    在本报“共产党员”专刊上展开的“共产党员应不应该有个人志愿”的讨论，是一场关于个性和党性的关系、个人和党的关系问题的争论。在这场争论中，异常鲜明地反映了两种世界观、两种立场的斗争。一种是以张家仁为代表的唯心主义的资产阶级个人主义者，他们站在资产阶级的立场上，用唯心主义的观点来观察问题。他们假借“解放思想，提倡共产主义风格”来夸大个性和个人志愿的“独立性”，把个性、个人志愿同党性、党的需要对立起来，把个人利益放在党的利益之上，把个人自由放在组织纪律之上。其实，他们所了解的个性，只是资产阶级的个性，而不是无产阶级的个性；他们所了解的党性，也是资产阶级的党性，而不是无产阶级的党性。他们反对党员做党的工具，尤其反对党员做党的驯服的工具。他们污蔑党让干什么就安心干什么的党员是“没有理想”、“没有头脑”、“没有创造性”、“碌碌无为”的人。他们很猖狂地向党进攻，企图以西风压倒东风，以白旗压倒红旗。同他们针锋相对的是绝大多数共产党员的唯物主义的无产阶级的红旗。这些同志坚决地驳斥了以张家仁为代表的资产阶级个人主义的唯心主义的观点，保卫了无产阶级的唯物主义的观点，保卫了党的组织原则。可以说，这一场争论是以拔掉白旗，插上红旗，是以东风压倒西风的形势而终结的。
    张家仁等认为，党员服从党的分配，党让干什么就安心干什么，就是“没有头脑”、“没有出息”的工具，而且傲慢地说，他们瞧不起这样的党员。我们说，我们首先是工具。我们是主人又是工具。这是马克思列宁主义的基本理论问题。这正是我们同资产阶级在个人和集体关系问题上的根本分歧。请问，我们不是工具又是什么呢？我们不做工具又做什么呢？党员是工具，是党的工具。归根到底，党员个人和党都是工具，是无产阶级的工具，是人民的工具。国家也是工具，是统治阶级的工具：剥削阶级的国家，是少数剥削者的工具；我们的国家，是工人阶级领导的全体人民的工具。我们每个党员、革命者、主席、总理等等都是工具。
    做工具好不好呢？很好。说做工具是“没有头脑”、“没有出息”，也就是说，做党的工具是“不光荣”的“傻瓜”的说法，难道有丝毫道理吗？我们全党一千二百多万党员都在做工具，难道都是些“没头脑、没出息”的“傻瓜”吗？我们无数革命先烈也是党的工具，他们为了党的事业、革命的事业，抛头颅、洒热血，前仆后继、英勇牺牲，难道都是些“没头脑、没出息”的“傻瓜”吗？我们过去能够打倒三大敌人，建立了中华人民共和国，现在我们党正在领导全国人民从事“一天等于二十年”的社会主义建设，取得了史无前例的丰功伟绩，难道都是一些“没头脑、没出息”的“傻瓜”干出来的吗？真是岂有此理！但是有的人，他们硬是不承认自己是工具，硬是不当这种“没头脑、没出息”的“傻瓜”，那么他们“有头脑、有出息”，他们是“聪明”人，他们想做什么呢？他们想把党当成他们的工具，想把党当成汽车，他是开车的，想爬到党的头上驾驭党，而不让自己当汽车，当工具，不让党来领导他、驾驭他。正像列宁在“进一步、退两步”这本书里批判孟塞维克在组织问题上的机会主义思想所说的：“党的组织，在他们看来好像是凶恶可怕的‘工厂’，部分服从整体和少数服从多数的原则，在他们看来好像是‘奴隶束缚制’……，他们一听见在中央领导之下实行分工，便发出可怜而又可笑的狂吠，反对把人们变成‘机轮和螺丝钉’……，他们一听见有人提起党的组织章程，便装出看不起人的样子，发出鄙视的……意见，说完全不要章程也是可以的。”请听一听吧，我们的那些反对把党员做党的工具，反对把自己做工具、做螺丝钉的“聪明”人，是多么像列宁所批判的孟塞维克呵！其实这些不愿做工具的“聪明”人，他们的头脑并不那么聪明，他们的骨头并不那么硬，他们的灵魂并不那么圣洁，他们的所作所为并不那么光彩。阶级社会中明明存在着阶级，可是这些人同一切反动统治者一样，硬是否认阶级的存在；在阶级社会中的知识分子，本来不是为这个阶级服务就是为那个阶级服务，总是作了某个阶级的工具，可是他们硬是否认这一点。反动统治阶级为什么要死死地隐讳这些呢？这是因为他们怕人民知道了这个道理，就会反抗他们，就要革他们的命。可是我们那些有严重资产阶级思想的人，也跟着叫嚷起来，好像党的工具是瘟疫病，是万万沾不得的。其实他们自己又何尝不是工具呢？只是他们不自觉或者是故意不承认罢了。他们为了自己的私利和享受，还不是像无头苍蝇一样在东奔西撞么？他们为了自己的名誉和地位，还不是到处卑躬屈膝、孜孜以求么？他们为了自己的私利，总是在资产阶级的宝座之下，顶礼朝拜，哀哀上告，心甘情愿做资产阶级的奴才犹恐不可得，这种人不是资产阶级的工具又是什么呢？我们共产党人是历史唯物论者，因此也是“工具论者”。我们不像反动统治者和资产阶级个人主义者一样，我们决不隐讳这些，而是要大讲特讲。因为这是客观事实，这是真理。我们为了解放自己，为了建设美好的社会，就需要自觉地做党和人民的工具。“我为人人、人人为我”，这就是说：我首先做工具，然后才做主人。这是我们个人和集体的关系。资产阶级个人主义者以做党和人民的工具为耻，我们以能作党和人民的工具为最大的光荣。
    有人说，作党的工具也可以，但是为什么非要作党的驯服工具不可呢？他们对“党的驯服工具”这个词感到很刺耳，思想感情上接受不了。我们说，既然党员是党的工具，就有应当作什么样的工具的问题。是作驯服的工具，还是作调皮的工具呢？是作容易驾驭的工具，还是作不容易驾驭的工具呢？当然要作驯服的工具，要作容易驾驭的工具。一个忠诚的共产党员，应该全心全意地为党为人民服务，要憎党之所憎，爱党之所爱，对敌人要“横眉冷对千夫指”，对党和人民要“俯首甘为孺子牛”，要善于领会党的意图，兢兢业业地，有时甚至不惜赴汤蹈火地去完成党所交付的任务；要会体贴人民的心情，知人民的冷暖，以党与人民之忧为忧，以党与人民之乐为乐，同党和人民心心相印，就像一个很精巧的工具，让党使起来非常灵便，得心应手。我们的无数先烈和广大党员都是这样的，党指到哪里，他们就奔向哪里，甚至不惜献出自己的生命。我们党就是依靠了这些忠诚的党员，战无不胜，攻无不克，从胜利走向胜利。可是对这些忠诚的党员，有的人却瞧不起。他们看到这些党员对党这样驯服、这样忠顺，在思想感情上接受不了。他们认为做党的驯服工具，有损他们的“自尊心”，有损他们的“清高”。因此他们对党总是若即若离，对党的话总是半信半疑，同党的关系总是格格不入、别别扭扭的；党叫他们干什么，他们总是讨价还价，犹犹豫豫。如拿工具来作比，也是一个破烂工具，使起来老不合辙，常出故障。试想一想，这样的人怎么能够做党和人民的驯服工具，怎么能够很好地为党为人民服务呢？他们的思想感情，在根本上不是无产阶级和劳动人民的思想感情，而是一种资产阶级的思想感情，对这种人必须进行认真的思想改造。
    有人说，党员做了驯服工具，就会变成死脑筋，叫干啥就干啥，妨碍发挥个人的创造性和才能。他们把有头脑同做驯服工具对立起来，把自觉地工作同服从党对立起来，说什么做驯服工具就没有理想，就不能发挥他的创造性和才能；要有头脑有创造性，就必须坚持个人志愿，不作驯服的工具。我们说，为了做党的驯服工具，正需要发挥每个人的聪明才智，发挥每个人的创造性和特长。做工具，有死工具也有活工具。死工具，不推不动，推一下，动一下，像汽车，不开它不动，不关它不停。还有活工具，人是活工具，不仅身体活动，脑子也活动。脑子多活动些好呢，还是少活动些好呢？当然是多活动些好。要敢想、敢说、敢干，敢于坚持真理、修正错误，鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省、精通业务。越是好的工具，越需要能动脑筋、能钻研问题，能大胆创造。发挥每个人的创造性和才能同做好驯服的工具，不但不矛盾，而且是相得益彰的。要做党的驯服的工具，而且要做积极性高、创造性大的工具。世界上只有共产党人的理想是最伟大的，难道世界上还有比终生为共产主义事业奋斗的理想更伟大的吗？难道世界上还有比敢干前人从未干过的共产主义事业的党员更能动脑筋、更能钻研、更有创造性的吗？远的不讲，就拿全国大跃进以来各地的发明创造来说，有哪一种不是愿做党和人民驯服工具的人创造成功的呢？问题不是很清楚吗？
    这么一说，党是否还允许党员有个人志愿呢？有人说根本不允许有，只要有就是有个人主义，这种说法也不正确。但是，党员的个人志愿跟资产阶级个人主义者的个人至上的志愿根本不同。一个人不是个人独立的，他是社会中间的一个人，是集体中间的一个人，他有社会性和历史性。特别是共产党员，他首先要有党性，即无产阶级的阶级性。所以，党员个人志愿是不是正确，能不能实现，就要看它对社会、对历史是起促进作用，还是起促退作用，是多促进一点，还是少促进一点。促进的是好的进步的，促退的就是不好的或者反动的。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、毛泽东就是促进的，而且促进得很大。有些自然科学家使人造卫星上了天，也是促进的，促进得也不小。有些人就促进得小一些。这都算做促进派。
    如何促进？这就要看历史发展的方向，要看人民前进的方向。历史车轮是不能阻挡的。谁要作促进派，就要循着历史发展的方向、人民的方向前进。如果方向错了，就是促退，或者反动，再有天大的个人志愿，也会要碰得头破血流，顶多作个希特勒、蒋介石吧，还不是身败名裂，遗臭万年！
    我们党是促进的。我们党坚持人民的方向，历史进步的方向，革命的方向。而且在历史的紧要关头，能够预见，能够决定正确的方针，采取正确的措施。这是因为我们党是无产阶级的政党，我们党掌握了马克思列宁主义，认识了社会发展规律。这一点是历史上任何其它阶级的党派都不能做到的。
    我们党的方向是正确的，一个共产党员就应该按照这个方向去奋斗。刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”这本书里说：“在党的利益与党的发展中包括着党员个人的利益与发展。党的阶级的成功与胜利，也就是党员的成功与胜利，党员只能在争取党的发展、成功与胜利中，来发展自己，不能够离开党的发展而去争取个人的独立发展。也只有党的发展、成功与胜利，党员才能发展自己，否则党员就不能发展。”事实证明，凡是把个人的志愿和党的方向一致起来，真心诚意地按照党所指出的方向奋斗的人，党胜利了，人民胜利了，个人也就胜利了。否则，反其道而行之，坚持“独立”的个人志愿，其结果并不美妙，有的甚至走向反党反人民的道路。
    有人也许觉得那是过去的事了，现在不一定那样了吧？我们说，现在也是一样。
    今天，党号召大家搞经济建设，搞技术革命、文化革命，党调了很多人去搞经济工作、科学技术工作、文教工作，其中有许多同志还不是以前根本没有搞过，甚至也没有设想过，但是他们响应党的这个号召，克服困难，认真学习，去从事这种工作。结果，他们也就成了各个建设岗位上的优秀的尖兵和领导者。
    有人说，我们这里谈的是个人志愿问题，是谈远大的理想，是谈将来呀，过去和现在的情况都不足为训了。是的，我们应该看到将来。将来怎样呢？再过若干年，中国就会变成共产主义社会了。到了共产主义社会，普通的社会分工，人人都能干，人人会种地，人人会作工；人人又都能专几门，会研究科学，会写文章……，成了“多面手”。那时候，脑力劳动者和体力劳动者的界限消灭了。人人是体力劳动者，人人又是脑力劳动者。那时候，城市和乡村的界限也消灭了。农民成了工人，工人也成了农民。那时将会有很多的发明家，取得人们的尊敬；但是那时谁也不能以一个“专家”的身份翘尾巴，摆架子，因为那时大家都是普通劳动者，又都是专家。这是党的愿望，也应该是党员的愿望。
    这就是社会历史发展的必然性。一个共产党员，一个革命者，如果能够认识和自觉地服从这个必然性，就一定会有自己的发展前途，会实现自己的志愿，就一定会感到自由；否则，不认识这个必然性，或者不服从这个必然性，就一定不会有自己的发展前途，不会实现自己的志愿，就一定会感到不自由。
    有人说，党所指出的方向是正确的，但是党组织分配党员工作不合适，甚至发生错误怎么办？我们说，这种情况是可能有的，所以我们党主张在分配党员工作的时候要尽可能倾听党员个人的意见，允许党员说明自己希望作什么，长处是什么，而且党也尽可能地予以照顾。但是工作的分配不能完全按照每个党员的愿望，而最主要的还是要根据社会历史发展的需要，革命和建设的需要，也就是党的需要来决定。因为革命事业是集体的事业，集体的事业就必须要有计划有组织地进行。社会主义建设是按计划按比例发展的。而个人的愿望又是比较复杂多样的。也许某项革命工作需要人多，愿意作的人少；某项革命工作需要人少，而愿意作的人又多。所以，党组织分配党员工作是对还是错，首先也要看革命需要来确定。过去革命战争时期，党需要搞武装斗争，不会打仗的党员、革命者，也要打仗；今天社会主义建设时期，党需要搞经济建设，不会搞经济建设的党员、革命者，也要搞经济建设。
    有些人说，我搞这行工作已经摸熟了，党又调我去搞别的，老这样改行，还能搞出什么名堂，还能有什么作为呢？我们说，一个人能不能搞出什么名堂，有没有作为，正是看他是不是服从党的需要和革命的需要。凡是党所需要的，革命所需要的，就都是重要的工作；为这个重要工作去进行有效的努力，不只推动了社会历史的发展，也才使自己能够真正有所成就。有些同志过去想搞化学、物理……但是在革命战争时期上了山，现在又搞了这样或者那样经济工作，而且工作做得很出色。鲁迅先生原来想做医生，后来觉得当时医生并不能救中国，就搞了能同敌人做斗争的文学，……他们都是改过行的，但是能够说他们没有作为、没有成就吗？当然不能。假如他们不服从革命的需要，不改行，至多也不过是一个普通专家而已。
    有些人一提什么个人志愿，就想当技术专家。党分配他做政治工作，他就消极，说什么做政治工作的是“万金油”干部，不顶事。我们说，没有做政治工作的干部绝对不行。技术专家固然重要，政治工作干部仍然要挂帅。干革命，搞建设没有政治挂帅不行。什么是政治挂帅？就是政治领导，什么是政治领导？就是搞阶级关系，搞人与人的关系，搞相互关系，就是看形势、指方向、提任务、想办法。没有政治挂帅，没有政治家领导，技术专家就会迷失方向，就会“专”到资本主义道路上去。政治家领导技术专家是一般的规律。政治工作干部缺少不得。服从党的分配做政治工作干部，不只对革命有利，对自己也是无尚的光荣。当然，做政治工作的干部应当又红又专，不能只红不专。因为不能专，也就不能在具体业务上红。
    至于服从党的分配之后，是不是允许党员在本职工作之外还有其它的志趣，我们说，在一定限度内是允许的。因为只要不违背党的利益，不妨害完成党所分配的工作，党员有其它的志趣并不是坏事。过去上山打游击的时候，有些人还不是可以写诗、写小说；今天搞建设，有些人还不是也可以成为业余的歌唱家，无线电爱好者。将来到共产主义社会，每天不需要八小时工作，可以作四、五小时工作，其余的时间不能都玩了，还不是可以学习、研究、搞副业。
    从这次讨论来看，什么人爱强调个人志愿，什么人把个人志愿同党的需要对立起来，什么人看不起和不愿作党的驯服工具呢？我们看，只能说是有严重资产阶级个人主义思想的人。张家仁就是这种人的代表。他们强调个人志愿，强调个人的理想，鄙视服从党的分配、愿做党的驯服工具的人，说这些人“没有头脑”、“没有出息”、“碌碌无为”、“生平无大志”。他们鄙视这个鄙视那个，但是就不鄙视资产阶级个人主义；他们教训这个教训那个，就是不教训自己应该服从六亿人民的集体利益和需要。他们树起了白旗，好像所有党员都应该向他们学习，实际是向一切忠诚的共产党员挑战。他们想西风压倒东风，压倒我们。试想一想，如果我们全体党员都像他们一样成为自私自利的个人主义者，那将是些什么样的党员？由那样的党员组成的党，又将是一个什么样的党，它同万恶的国民党还会有什么区别？
    从本文上述分析来看，这些人所提倡的什么志愿也好，理想也好，创造也好，才能也好，自有他们自己的一套资产阶级的解释，同我们党所提倡的志愿、理想、创造、才能是根本相反的。不管他们口头上说得多么冠冕堂皇，揭开来看只不过是资产阶级的一堆破烂而已。他们是一些自私自利的极端个人主义者，是一些追求低级趣味的人。真正“没有头脑”、“没有出息”、“碌碌无为”、“生平无大志”的，恰恰正是他们自己。在讨论中，这些人还抓住我们党内有的党员朝气不足、安于中游的现象而大作文章，来证明他们的谬论好像是有根据的。当然，有的党员朝气不足、安于中游是不好的，是缺点，应该批评教育，要他们鼓足干劲、力争上游，而绝不是要他们强调个人志愿、个人理想。这些同志多数是可以教育的。事实上，经过整风和在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，很多同志已经扫除了暮气，干劲十足了，他们同那些资产阶级个人主义者是根本不同的。从讨论中我们可以清楚地看到，那些资产阶级个人主义者，他们在贯彻执行总路线的幌子下，在“发扬朝气、敢想敢做”等漂亮的词藻掩盖下，贩卖他们资产阶级的私货。他们不是提倡人们鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义，即全心全意为六亿人民服务，做党的驯服的工具，而是强调什么个人至上的个人志愿；他们不是按照总路线的精神去敢想敢做，而是按照他们的个人打算胡思乱想；他们不是鼓励人们全心全意、精神奋发地去完成党的任务，而是制造思想混乱，涣散人民的斗志；他们不是维护和增强党的团结，而是妨碍和削弱党的团结；他们不是引导人们走向正确的道路，而是引导人们走向错误的歧途。总之，他们所宣扬的不是无产阶级的思想，而是腐臭的资产阶级思想。因此，这次讨论实质上带有阶级斗争的性质。张家仁是代表资产阶级个人主义向无产阶级集体主义宣战的白旗，无产阶级必须坚决同它进行斗争，拔掉这面白旗，插上我们的红旗。
    当然，资产阶级个人主义思想不是通过几次讨论就能彻底扫除的。资产阶级个人主义者，他们总是千方百计地到处表现自己，乱刮他们的歪风，传播他们的谬论，散发他们的臭气。我们要提高嗅觉，善于识别风向。发现歪风，坚决顶住，发现白旗，坚决拔掉，到处插上无产阶级的红旗、共产主义的红旗。
    共产党员究竟应该有什么样的志愿呢？任何忠诚的共产党员，都应该：鼓足干劲、力争上游，做一个党的奋发有为的驯服的工具，为贯彻执行党的总路线，为实现共产主义的伟大理想而奋斗。这就是我们的结论。
