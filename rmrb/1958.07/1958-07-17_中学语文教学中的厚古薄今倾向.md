    The Chinese language teaching in middle schools has always included the teaching of literary works and Chinese language knowledge. The term "literary works" is broad, including political essays with literary flair. Chinese language knowledge is not taught separately but is generally taught in conjunction with the reading and teaching of literary works. From the autumn of 1956, middle schools across the country began using separately compiled literature textbooks and Chinese language textbooks. The newly compiled literature textbooks can be said to be an expansion, and at the same time a reduction, of the literary works section in the traditional Chinese language teaching. Expansion refers to the increased quantity; reduction refers to the transformation of the broad literary works into narrow literary works, basically limited to poetry, prose, novels, and plays. Expanding the proportion of literary works also expands the portion of classical works within them. Works before the "May Fourth" Movement are considered classical works, and works after are considered modern works. In junior high school literature textbooks, classical works account for one-third of all lessons. In senior high school literature textbooks, classical works account for one-half of all lessons. There are six volumes of literature textbooks for both junior and senior high schools. In junior high, classical works are scattered throughout the volumes. In senior high, due to the adoption of a system of arranging works chronologically according to literary history, classical works are concentrated in the first, second, and third volumes. In the past, Chinese language textbooks did not have any classical literary works in junior high, and senior high had some, but only about 30-40% of all lessons. Compared to the Chinese language textbooks used in the past, the current literature textbooks have a significantly larger number of classical literary works. The senior high literature textbooks, due to their chronological arrangement based on literary history, not only have a large number of classical works but also teach them in a concentrated manner. The "Extracurricular Reading Reference List" accompanying classroom teaching includes selections from "Water Margin," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Journey to the West," and "The Scholars" for junior high. For senior high, it includes more than twenty important works from the Zhou Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty, including "Selections of Yuefu Poetry," "Romance of the West Chamber," "Dream of the Red Chamber," and even "Stories to Caution the World" and "Vernacular Stories from the Capital."

    The large increase in classical literary works in literature textbooks, in addition to causing difficulties for teachers in preparing lessons and students in learning, has also led to the following drawbacks:

    First, there are significant deviations in students' acquisition of social life knowledge and the moral influence they receive. One of the main purposes of literary work teaching is to allow students to be infected by the images in literary works, expanding the scope of social life knowledge on the one hand, and improving moral cultivation imperceptibly on the other. This is what we often call the ideological and educational role of literature. Correct literary teaching uses the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to guide students in reading literary works, helping them to understand and evaluate the social life phenomena expressed in the works, critically absorbing the beneficial aspects of the works, and discarding the dross. However, even if the teaching of literary works can complete such a task well, the excessive amount of classical literary works still leads to a large deviation in the teaching effect. Students certainly need to expand the scope of their social life knowledge, how social life develops and changes, and how people's thoughts and feelings develop in different social environments. However, understanding the modern social life situation (the class struggle and production activities engaged in by modern people) and the psychological state of modern people is undoubtedly more important than understanding the ancient social life situation and the psychological state of ancient people. For example, reading "Mulberry on the Path" and reading "Little Hero Yu Lai" (both lessons in literature textbooks) have very different levels of practicality in the knowledge gained and the healthiness of the emotional influence received. Reading "Mulberry on the Path" helps to understand the life and thoughts of an ancient woman like Luo Fu, and to feel the preciousness of her steadfast spirit; reading "Little Hero Yu Lai" helps to understand the life and thoughts of a teenager like Yu Lai under various persecutions by the Japanese invaders, and to feel the preciousness of his firm revolutionary stance and indomitable fighting spirit cultivated under the education of the Party. Compared, the latter is undoubtedly more beneficial for growing adolescents. This is true not only for reading works like "Mulberry on the Path," but even for reading the best works of writers such as Du Fu and Bai Juyi, the difference in the practicality of the knowledge gained and the healthiness of the emotional influence received is still significant compared to reading modern works. Since we want to cultivate the next generation into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, the more modern the work, the greater its educational and instructive role. The proportion of classical and modern works in terms of quantity is actually a ratio of two different types of social knowledge and moral cultivation. Emphasizing the ancient and belittling the modern is clearly a manifestation of a non-political tendency, detached from the needs of the country and the actual situation of students. Even in the most ideal situation, that is, when teachers can all use the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method for teaching, the teaching effect of classical literary works is still a case of achieving half the result with twice the effort. Teaching a large amount of classical literary works becomes a teaching activity that is divorced from politics and reality. Moreover, in fact, quite a few teachers cannot currently use the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method for teaching! Literature textbooks, having excessively selected classical literary works, overemphasized the system of literary history, and one-sidedly emphasized the artistry of works while neglecting their ideological content, included "Guan Ju" from the "Book of Songs," Yuefu poems from the Six Dynasties, Liu Yong's "Rain Bells," and "A Heartfelt Confession" from "Dream of the Red Chamber," etc., resulting in this deviation becoming a serious loss in political and ideological education.

    Second, in language teaching, there is a serious detachment from reality. This is especially true in the first academic year and the first semester of the second academic year of senior high school, because the literature textbooks used during these times are all classical literary works. Another main purpose of literary work teaching is to improve students' language skills, mainly their reading and writing abilities. Guiding students in reading literary works should also take improving students' language skills as a task. The effect of literary works on the improvement of students' language abilities can occur over a relatively long period or relatively quickly, depending on the language of the work (whether it is ancient or modern language). Since students use modern language, the more direct the influence is if they read works written in modern Chinese, and the greater the effect. Students' language skills can be improved relatively quickly by reading such works. Since classical works use the language of the past, there are significant limitations in using them as models for learning language. For the language characteristics of the entire work to have a greater effect on the improvement of students' language skills, even if the teaching work is carried out very well (for example, if there is systematic composition teaching combined with the language teaching of classical works; when teaching classical works, the characteristics of the language and chapter structure of the work can be explained very well...), the effect will still occur over a relatively long period, which is far from the effect of modern works. Due to spending a lot of time on the teaching of classical literary works, thereby relatively reducing the teaching time of modern works, if classical literary works are not taught well, even this effect that may occur over a relatively long period will be lost. On the contrary, it may temporarily affect students' language, making it messy. We should face the reality that modern Chinese itself still needs great efforts to gradually standardize it; middle school Chinese language teaching has not yet solved the problem of improving students' reading and writing abilities well; the rapid development of social construction urgently requires the reading and writing abilities of middle school graduates to be improved rapidly. Under such circumstances, letting students study a large amount of classical literary works, and thereby relatively reducing the time for studying modern literary works, is of course more harmful than beneficial in terms of language learning.

    Third, teaching too many classical literary works, in addition to the above two deviations, also has a bad consequence, which is that students gradually develop an attitude of "praising the ancient and belittling the modern" towards the literature of the motherland, thinking that the ancient is good and the modern is bad. Classical literary works and modern literary works, of course, have good ones and bad ones. Which ones are good, which ones are bad, what makes them good, and what makes them bad must be carefully analyzed for each work, and each work must be evaluated within the context of its time. It is impossible to generalize. If one has to generalize and compare classical works with modern works, and talk about their advantages and disadvantages in general, then in terms of the ideological level of the works, even the lowest level of modern works is certainly higher than that of classical works. Thorough democratic thought, patriotism combined with internationalism, socialist thought, etc., are all absent from classical works, while we can receive more or less of these ideological educations from any good modern work. This is self-evident. The same is true in terms of the artistic level of the works. If one has to generalize and compare classical works with modern works in general, saying that the artistic level of modern works is generally lower than that of classical works is also a historically arbitrary judgment. For example, the integrity of the structure of a work, in any case, modern works are generally stronger than classical works. It can be seen that it is not right to say in general that classical works are good and modern works are bad. Even focusing solely on the artistic level, it is not right to say in general that classical works are good and modern works are bad. "Praising the ancient and belittling the modern," in terms of ideological foundation, is a manifestation of neglecting political and ideological education. In terms of literary views, it is to evaluate the artistry of works separately from the ideology of works, which is a purely technical viewpoint. In addition to being a manifestation of neglecting political and ideological education in the same way, it is also to observe literary works with an absolutely formalistic method. In short, letting students develop an attitude of "praising the ancient and belittling the modern" is to make them develop a lack of class viewpoint for literature for life, and a viewpoint of literature for literature based on non-political tendencies. These are all bourgeois literary viewpoints. The formation of this erroneous attitude and erroneous viewpoint is of course very complicated. However, the inclusion of too many classical literary works in literature textbooks also bears considerable responsibility.

    The ideological roots of this error of emphasizing the ancient and belittling the modern in middle school Chinese language teaching are mainly the following two:

    First, the understanding of the educational policy and the purpose and tasks of middle school Chinese language teaching is not clear. Our educational policy, as Chairman Mao said in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" in February 1957, is "should enable those who receive education to develop in moral, intellectual, and physical aspects, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." Prior to this, the State Council's instruction was "to educate students with socialist thought and cultivate them into comprehensively developed members of socialist society." Whether now or in the past, the educational policy requires students to receive socialist ideological education, have socialist consciousness, and have the cultural knowledge necessary for building socialism, not to generally require them to master all kinds of social life knowledge, understand all kinds of social life, and accept the influence of the thoughts and feelings of all kinds of people. However, the current literature textbooks generally require students to master all kinds of social life knowledge, understand all kinds of social life, and accept the influence of the thoughts and feelings of all kinds of people. The ideological content of classical literary works, at its most progressive, is only humanism, nationalism, and patriotism, and anti-feudal privilege democracy... These are indeed the excellent traditions in our country's culture and thought, but they are not what middle school students urgently need, nor are they easy for middle school students to accept correctly (because they need to be criticized correctly). The literary works created on the basis of these ideas do have some that are valuable literary heritages in our country, but the infection to readers is not the infection of socialist thoughts and feelings, but the infection of all kinds of non-socialist thoughts and feelings. Especially in the absence of correct criticism, the ideological and educational effect of classical literature runs counter to the policy of "cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture," and also runs counter to the policy of "cultivating comprehensively developed members of socialist society." The language of classical literary works is basically dead language. Learning this language is useful for directly appreciating classical literature and studying heritage. However, it is impossible for middle school students to learn this language to directly appreciate classical literature, and studying heritage is a matter for scholars, not for young students. In order to better engage in socialist construction work, middle school students are eager to master the living language on the lips of the people, which is standardized modern Chinese. The current middle school graduates have not mastered modern language well; and the current Chinese language teaching still has many difficulties to overcome in helping students master modern language. Under such circumstances, teaching a large amount of classical literary works, especially thereby relatively reducing the time for teaching modern literary works, is obviously running counter to the requirements of building a socialist society.

    Second, this unclear understanding of the educational policy and the purpose and tasks of middle school Chinese language teaching is inseparable from the bourgeois literary viewpoints of literature for life and literature for literature, and the subjective work style. Classical literary works express the thoughts and feelings of feudal scholar-officials or bourgeois intellectuals. Those negative ideas of escaping from the world and declining feelings, needless to say, even Li Bai's contempt for the powerful and noble, Du Fu and Bai Juyi's sympathy for the toiling people, Xin Qiji's love for the country and worry about the world...etc., are not very harmonious when placed together with the vigorous vitality and joyful mood in the socialist revolution. We have just been liberated from the control of the old cultural thoughts. On the one hand, the thoughts and feelings of feudal scholar-officials and bourgeois intellectuals are attached to middle-aged people, and still influence the younger generation in a visible or invisible way. On the other hand, many of the younger generation come from families of the exploiting classes, and they themselves have factors that easily resonate with old thoughts and feelings. In addition, the enemies in cultural and ideological fields are still using backward thoughts and feelings to corrupt the younger generation. Under such circumstances, those works in classical literature that have negative ideas of escaping from the world and declining feelings are clearly allies of the backward thoughts and feelings in the current society. Even those relatively progressive works are difficult to exert their positive role, and may have negative effects when they cannot be correctly and critically accepted due to various reasons. Therefore, emphasizing the teaching of classical literary works, especially carrying out the teaching of classical literary works on a large scale without any criticism, is in fact divorced from politics, is literature for literature, and even caters to the backward forces in society. Since it is divorced from politics, it is very natural to one-sidedly emphasize the artistry of works and instill students with artistic evaluations that are divorced from politics and the ideological content of works. And all this is a reflection of bourgeois ideology in literary teaching.

    The actual experience of the past two years proves that there is a tendency of emphasizing the ancient and belittling the modern in middle school Chinese language teaching. Of course, if teaching is carried out correctly, classical literary works can play a positive role in expanding students' field of social life knowledge, improving students' language abilities, and improving students' thoughts and morals. However, one should not emphasize the ancient and belittle the modern. In addition, one should also pay attention to the target audience, and should not uniformly guide students to read a large amount of material starting from the first grade of junior high school. One can consider not teaching classical works in junior high, and teaching some in senior high; one should pay attention to the selection of materials, and should not select those works that have side effects on ideological education; and one should pay attention to the teaching method, and should not praise without any criticism.

    The research and introduction of the motherland's literature must be turned from the erroneous direction of emphasizing the ancient and belittling the modern, and resolutely implement the policy of emphasizing the modern and belittling the ancient. The ancient should be belittled, and the modern should be emphasized; the purpose of researching and introducing the ancient is also to promote the modern. Middle school Chinese language teaching should also be like this. We must overcome the viewpoints of literature for life that lack class viewpoint and literature for literature based on non-political tendencies, and the subjective work style divorced from reality, and turn the erroneous line of emphasizing the ancient and belittling the modern into the correct line of emphasizing the modern and belittling the ancient.

    中学语文教学中的厚古薄今倾向
    张毕来
    中学语文教学，一向包括文学作品和汉语知识的讲授。“文学作品”这个词儿是广义的，包括富有文学风趣的政论。汉语知识并不单独讲授，一般是结合文学作品阅读教学讲授。1956年秋季起，全国中学开始用分编的文学课本和汉语课本。新编的文学课本，可以说是向来的语文教学中的文学作品部分的扩大，同时又是缩小。扩大，指的是增加了分量；缩小，指的是把广义的文学作品变为狭义的文学作品，基本上只限于诗歌、散文、小说、剧本。扩大文学作品的分量，同时也就扩大了其中的古典作品部分。以“五四”为界，以前的作品算是古典作品，以后的作品算是现代作品。初中文学课本，古典作品占全部课文的三分之一。高中文学课本，古典作品占全部课文的二分之一。初中和高中的文学课本各有六册。初中，古典作品散见于各册。高中，由于采用了依文学史系统从古到今地编排作品的办法，古典作品集中于第一、第二、第三册。过去的语文课本，初中的没有古典文学作品，高中的有一些，也只是全部课文的十之三、四。现在的文学课本，比起过去所用的语文课本来，古典文学作品可说是大量地增加了。高中的文学课本，由于依文学史系统从古到今地编排作品的缘故，古典作品不但大量地增加，还集中讲授。配合课堂教学的“课外阅读参考书目”，初中部分，有“水浒”，有“三国演义”“西游记”“儒林外史”的节选。高中部分，有从周朝到清末的重要作品二十多种，其中有“乐府诗选”“西厢记”“红楼梦”，连“警世通言”和“京本通俗小说”也包括进去了。
    文学课本中的古典文学作品大量增加，除了引起教师备课困难、学生学习吃力等等问题而外，还产生了下面这些弊病。
    第一，在学生所获得的社会生活知识和所受到的品德影响两方面，都有极大的偏差。文学作品教学的主要目的之一，是要学生从文学作品的形象受到感染，一方面扩大社会生活知识的范围，一方面在潜移默化之间提高品德修养。这就是我们常说的文学的思想教育作用。正确的文学教学，是用马克思列宁主义的立场观点方法去指导学生阅读文学作品，帮助他们认识和评价表现在作品里的社会生活现象，批判地吸取作品中有益的东西，扬弃其中的糟粕。可是，即使文学作品的教学目下能够很好地完成这样的任务，而古典文学作品过多，教学效果仍然是个大偏差。学生诚然需要扩大社会生活知识的范围，社会生活是怎样发展变化的，怎样的人在怎样的社会环境里思想感情会怎样发展，可是，认识现代的社会生活状况（现代人所从事的阶级斗争和生产活动）和现代人的心理状况，比起认识古代社会生活状况和古代人的心理状况来，无疑地是更为重要的。例如读一篇“陌上桑”和读一篇“小英雄雨来”（都是文学课本里的课文），所获得的知识的实用性和所受到的情感影响的健康程度，都很不同。读“陌上桑”，认识罗敷这样一个古代女子的生活和思想感情，从而感到她那样的坚贞不二的精神之可贵；读“小英雄雨来”，认识雨来这样一个少年在日寇各种各样逼迫下的生活和思想感情，从而感到他那样的人在党的教育下培养起来坚定不移的革命立场和不屈不挠的斗争精神之可贵。比较起来，后者对于在成长中的青少年，无疑地是更有好处的。读“陌上桑”这样的作品固然如此，就是读杜甫、白居易等作家的最好的作品，比起读现代的作品来，得到的知识的实用性和受到的感情影响的健康程度，差别仍是很大的。我们既然要把后一代培养成有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者，那末，越是现代的作品，其教养作用和教育作用就越大。古典作品和现代作品在分量上的比例，实际上是两种不同的社会知识和品德修养的比例。厚古薄今，显然是脱离国家需要脱离学生实际的，是非政治倾向的表现。即使在最理想的情况下，即教师都能很好地运用马克思列宁主义的立场观点方法进行教学的情况下，古典文学作品的教学效果，也仍然是事倍功半的。大量地教学古典文学作品，就成了脱离政治脱离实际的教学活动。何况事实上相当多的教师目下并不能用马克思列宁主义的立场观点方法进行教学呢！文学课本，既已过多地选编古典文学作品，又过分强调文学史的系统，片面地强调作品的艺术性忽视作品的思想内容，选入了“诗经”的“关睢”篇，六朝乐府，柳永的“雨霖铃”，“红楼梦”的“诉肺腑”等等，结果就使这个偏差成为政治思想教育上的严重损失。
    第二，在语言教学上严重地脱离实际，这种情况，尤以高中第一学年和第二学年上学期为然，因为这些时候所用的文学课本里全是古典文学作品。文学作品教学的另一个主要目的，是提高学生的语言修养，主要就是提高他们的阅读能力和写作能力。指导学生阅读文学作品，还应该以提高学生语言修养为任务。文学作品对于学生语言能力的提高，其作用有要在比较长的时间内才能发生的，有可以比较快地发生的，视作品的语言而定（看它是古代语言，还是现代语言）。学生既然使用现代语言，那末，所读的是用现代汉语写的作品，其影响更直接，作用也就更大，学生的语言修养就可以比较快地因阅读这样的作品而提高。古典作品，既然所用的语言是过去的语言，作为学习语言的典范，就有很大的局限性，要整篇作品的语言特点在学生语言修养的提高上发生更大的作用，即使在教学工作进行得非常好的情况下（例如有有系统的作文教学同古典作品的语言教学配合；讲授古典作品的时候，能够很好地讲解作品的语言和篇章结构的特点……），那作用也是要在比较长的时期内才能发生，比起现代作品来，差得很远。由于在古典文学作品的教学上花很多时间因而相对地减少了现代作品的教学时间，如果古典文学作品再教得不好，就连这一点在比较长的时间内可能发生的作用也会没有，相反，暂时还可能影响学生的语言，使其杂乱。应该正视这样的现实：现代汉语本身，还需要很大的努力才能使其逐渐规范化；中学语文教学，目下还没有很好地解决学生阅读能力和写作能力的提高问题；社会建设的飞跃发展，迫切地要求中学毕业生的阅读能力和写作能力迅速提高。在这样的情况下让学生学习大量的古典文学作品，又因此相对地减少了学习现代文学作品的时间，就语言学习而论，当然害多利少。
    第三，过多地讲授古典文学作品，除了上面两种偏差而外，还有一种不良后果，那就是学生当中慢慢地养成一种对于祖国文学的“颂古非今”的态度，认为古代的好，现代的差。古典文学作品也好，现代文学作品也好，当然都有好的，都有差的。哪些好，哪些差，好在哪里，差在哪里，必须一篇篇作品仔细分析，而且得把每篇作品放在它所处的时代环境里去评价，不可一概而论，如果要一概而论，拿古典作品同现代作品相比，泛论其优劣，那末，就作品的思想水平说，现代作品中即使水平最低的，也一定比古典作品的高。彻底的民主主义思想，同国际主义结合的爱国主义思想，社会主义思想等等，都是古典作品中所没有的，而我们从任何一篇好的现代作品，都可以或多或少地受到这些思想教育。这是不言而喻的事。就作品的艺术水平说，也一样。如果一概而论，泛泛地拿古典作品同现代作品比较，说现代作品的艺术水平一般地低于古典作品，也是一种违反历史的武断。例如作品结构的完整性，无论如何，现代作品一般地强于古典作品。可见泛泛地说古典作品好而现代作品差，固然不对，就是单从艺术水平着眼，泛泛地说古典作品好而现代作品差，也不对。“颂古非今”，就思想基础而论，是忽视政治思想教育的表现，就文学观而论，是把作品的艺术性同作品的思想性分开来评价，是一种单纯技术观点，除了一样地是忽视政治思想教育的表现而外，又是用绝对的形式主义方法观察文学作品。总之，让学生养成“颂古非今”的态度，也就是使他们养成缺乏阶级观点的为人生而文学的观点，养成以非政治倾向为基础的为文学而文学的观点，这都是资产阶级文学观点。这种错误态度和错误观点的形成，原因当然很复杂，然而，文学课本中编入过多的古典文学作品，也有相当大的责任。
    中学语文教学中的这种厚古薄今的错误，其思想根源，主要的是下面两个。
    第一，对教育方针和中学语文教学目的任务认识不明确。我们的教育方针，毛主席1957年2月在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演里说是“应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。前此，国务院的指示是“以社会主义思想教育学生，培养他们成为社会主义社会全面发展的成员”。无论现在或过去，教育方针都要求学生受社会主义思想教育，有社会主义觉悟，有建设社会主义必需的文化知识，不是泛泛地要求他们掌握各种各样的社会生活知识，认识各种各样的社会生活，接受各种各样的人物的思想感情的影响。而目下的文学课本，正是泛泛地要求学生掌握各种各样的社会生活知识，认识各种各样的社会生活，接受各种各样的人物的思想感情的影响。古典文学作品的思想内容，最进步的也只是人道主义、民族主义和爱国主义、反封建特权的民主主义……。这些，诚然是我国文化思想中的优良传统，可是，不是目下中学生所急需的东西，也不是中学生易于正确地接受（因为要正确地批判）的东西。以这些思想为基础而创造的文学作品，其中也的确有好些是我国可贵的文学遗产，可是，对读者的感染，不是社会主义思想感情的感染，而是各种各样的非社会主义的思想感情的感染。尤其在没有正确的批判的情况下，古典文学的思想教育效果，是与“培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的方针背道而驰的，也是与“培养社会主义社会全面发展的成员”的方针背道而驰的。古典文学作品的语言，基本上是死的语言。学会这种语言，其用处在于直接欣赏古典文学，研究遗产。可是，学会这种语言，直接欣赏古典文学，在中学生是不可能的，而研究遗产是学者的事，不是青年学生的事。为了更好地从事社会主义建设工作，中学生急于掌握的，是人民口头上的活语言，是规范化的现代汉语。目下的中学毕业生，没有很好地掌握现代语言；目下的语文教学，在帮助学生掌握现代语言的工作上，还有许多尚未克服的困难。在这样的情况下大量地教学古典文学作品，尤其因此相对地减少教学现代文学作品的时间，显然与建设社会主义社会的要求背道而驰。
    第二，这种对教育方针和中学语文教学目的任务认识不明确，是与为人生而文学、为文学而文学的资产阶级文学观点和主观主义的工作作风分不开的。古典文学作品表现着封建士大夫或资产阶级知识分子的思想感情。那些消极的出世思想和没落感情，固不用说，就是李白的鄙夷权贵，杜甫、白居易的同情劳苦人民，辛弃疾的爱国忧世……等等，同社会主义革命中的蓬勃生气和快乐情调放在一起，也不甚融洽。我们刚刚从旧的文化思想的控制下解放出来。一方面，封建士大夫和资产阶级知识分子的思想感情，依附在中年人的身上，还有形无形地影响着年青的一代。另一方面，年青的一代，有许多又出身于剥削阶级的家庭，本身就具有易于同旧的思想感情共鸣的因素。此外，文化思想上的敌人还在利用落后的思想感情腐化年青的一代。在这样的情况下，古典文学中那些具有消极的出世思想和没落感情的作品，显然是目下社会上落后思想感情的同盟军。即使是那些比较进步的作品，其积极作用也难于发挥，由于种种原因而不能正确地批判地接受的时候，还会发生消极作用。因此，强调古典文学作品的教学，尤其是毫不批判地大量地进行古典文学作品教学，事实上是脱离政治，是为文学而文学，甚至是迎合社会上的落后势力。既然脱离政治，则片面地强调作品的艺术性，向学生灌输脱离政治脱离作品思想内容的艺术评价，就是很自然的了。而这一切乃是资产阶级思想在文学教学中的反映。
    两年来的实际经验，证明中学语文教学中是有厚古薄今倾向的。当然，如果正确地进行教学，古典文学作品在扩大学生的社会生活知识领域，提高学生语言能力，提高学生思想和品德几个方面，都可以发生积极的作用。但是，不应该厚古薄今。此外，还要注意对象，不应该从初中一年级起一律指导学生大量阅读，可以考虑初中不讲古典作品，高中讲一些；要注意选材，不应该选那些在思想教育上有副作用的作品；要注意教法，不应该毫无批判地颂扬。
    祖国文学的研究和介绍工作一定要从厚古薄今的错误方向转过来，坚决执行厚今薄古的方针。古的应该薄，今的应该厚；研究和介绍古的，目的也在于发扬今的。中学语文教学也应该这样。我们一定要克服缺乏阶级观点的为人生而文学和以非政治倾向为基础的为文学而文学的观点和脱离实际的主观主义作风，把厚古薄今的错误路线变为厚今薄古的正确路线。
