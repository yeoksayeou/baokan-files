Dalian Shipyard is Leaping Forward
——One of the Dalian Factory Compilations
　Zheng Zhong
    With the victory of the Rectification Movement, and especially with the deepening of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the Dalian Shipyard, like other factories, has seen a new situation of ideological and production leaps forward.

    Great Transformation of Cadre Work Style
    Last October, the factory posted 130,000 big-character posters, of which 30% criticized the work style of leaders at all levels; this year, the Double-Anti Movement posted 760,000 big-character posters, of which about 35% also criticized the work style of leading cadres.

    In the past, foremen worked in offices upstairs, with more commandism and less mass line, and little emphasis on politics. Now, foremen live with the workers, discussing matters together and working together. The workers call this "foremen going to the countryside." One big-character poster from the workers of the ship repair hull workshop praised a section chief for changing his work style, writing vividly:

    Attitude was arrogant and rude,
    Without in-depth inspection and guidance,
    Pointing fingers and criticizing randomly,
    Frowning and finding faults;
    Making workers feel dejected and annoyed,
    How could morale be high for production?

    Now the work style has changed,
    With both in-depth inspection and specific guidance,
    The workers feel happy,
    Determined to participate in the new high tide of production.

    Another example of praising leading cadres, written by the forging workshop:

    The forging workshop is small and tiny, leading cadres rarely come;
    Some opinions have nowhere to be raised, raised opinions are ignored;
    Workers and cadres have a trick, they keep the opinions to themselves.

    Now the past is very different, the atmosphere inside the workshop has changed.
    The Rectification Movement is truly great, leaders come down to the workshop,
    Factory Director Li is seen every day, the secretary comes by once a day,
    The chairman of the trade union often visits, the secretary of the Communist Youth League is also seen,
    When talking about work problems, they are solved and guided,
    This work style is really good, we proactively look for them when there are issues.

    Great Change in Mass Ideology
    Through big-character posters, extensive airing of views, cadre self-criticism, transformation of work styles, and big-character posters, big debates, and big comparisons among workers, the workers' awareness has generally improved.

    In the shipbuilding engine workshop, there is a worker named Yang Chengxin, who is the factory's Liu Jiemai. He was originally a beggar who became a worker after liberation and earned a monthly salary of one hundred yuan. However, when the rightists attacked the Party last year, he also opposed the Party's policy of unified purchase and sale... Later, after the factory organized an exhibition of his deeds, some backward workers quickly admitted their mistakes, feeling sorry for the Party and the people. Of the thirty-eight backward workers in four sections of the shipbuilding hull workshop, twenty-nine have now transformed, and fourteen of them have become advanced workers; the socialist ideology and style of "One for all, all for one" has become more widespread. Workers say: "In the past, meetings were about eating and dressing; now they are about working hard and studying diligently." Liu Xigong, a worker in the ship repair hull workshop, usually did not work hard and went home after work. He raised more than one hundred chickens at home and hired a worker on sick leave to take care of the chickens for him. In addition to receiving their state-issued salaries, Liu Xigong earned an extra income of more than one hundred and eighty yuan per month. After Liu Xigong made a self-criticism at the big debate meeting, he sold all the chickens and also mobilized the worker on sick leave to go to work.

    The unity and cooperation among workers has been greatly strengthened. Electricians in the electrical workshop and workers in the handover section were previously known as "young masters," who would read books and novels when there was nothing to do, thinking that no matter how much they did, they would get the same pay. After the debate on who they were working for, they started working at seven o'clock in the morning. When the electrician Liu Jiantang saw that the ship's electrical workers were busy, he risked danger and took the initiative to climb up the main mast to help complete the task.

    The workers' sense of ownership has been improved, and they attach great importance to product quality and material conservation, and can supervise each other.

    The positions of many engineering and technical personnel have been transformed, and their political ideology has greatly changed. After heart-to-heart talks and debates, socialism has gained the upper hand, the slogan of being both red and expert is very loud, the bourgeois individualism has been systematically exposed, and middle-of-the-roaders have turned to the left one after another. More than 160 technical personnel in the technology section have voluntarily gone down to the workshops to combine with the workers. A technical personnel named Lu Zuanzhong drew nine comic strips of his progress after the Rectification Movement, writing:

    1. The bell rings for work, I'm still not there; there is a lot of work, but I am carefree.
    2. I don't care about others being busy, but say cold words, why bother to be enlightened, no need to be tired.
    3. Trivial matters are the most annoying, I can't take care of them; Never mind the general cleaning, ride the "dragon car" and run.
    4. Meetings are even more annoying, find a dark corner to lean on; waving a fan and curling smoke, muddling through the meeting.
    5. The drum of the Rectification Movement sounds, heart-to-heart talks are like waking from a dream; seriously excavate deeply, determined to transform.
    6. Getting up early and working late, burying myself and working hard; a batch of dredgers, saving 150,000.
    7. In the past, it was difficult to invite, but now I run happily; I personally go to the workshop to drill into the problem.
    8. Politics is the commander, ideology has been turned upside down; the speeches are enthusiastic, determined to be red and expert.
    9. Business work is full of energy, social work is not bad; moving to live with the workers, determined to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology.

    Major Reform of Rules and Regulations
    This factory has many unreasonable rules and regulations that hinder the development of productive forces. Since the Rectification Movement and the airing of views, relatively bold rectifications have been made. For example, in the past, production preparation was concentrated in the technical section of the factory, and the production preparation cycle for major repairs was about four to six months: there were seventy-six procedures from ordering to acceptance. Now, inspection, matching, and some processes are decentralized to the workshops, ordering procedures are simplified, and preparation work is shortened to two months. In the past, receiving materials required sixteen procedures, with more than 40,000 material tickets per month. Now it has been simplified to three procedures, with a maximum of five, which everyone praises, and the number of material tickets has been reduced to more than 20,000. In the past, the accounting department monopolized financial power, and everyone had to go to the department to get even a penny, receiving about 500 people every day, and more than 100 staff members in the department were still overwhelmed; now, power has been decentralized, which is not only convenient, but the number of staff in the entire department has been reduced to 25, and the economic awareness of the workshops has been enhanced, and costs have been greatly reduced. From January to May, the actual cost reduction was 21% compared to 1957 (comparable product costs). In the past: the signature procedures were complicated, eight people signed a drawing, and the old workers criticized it as "three sevens are twenty-eight, the leaders are careless, the drawings are placed on the table, the signatures are not checked...", but mistakes still abound. Now, with three people signing, the errors have been greatly reduced.

    The workers' enthusiasm is high, completing 6.6 million in March, 7.7 million in April, 8.5 million in May, and may reach 9.4 million in June, rising step by step.

    Significant Shortening of Docking Cycle
    One of the main equipment for ship repair is the dry dock. In 1956, the average docking cycle for major repairs was 68 days, and in 1957 it was 52 days; this year, the goal was to shorten it to 42 days, but after hearing that the Jiangnan Shipyard was going to shorten major ship repairs from 207 to 210 days to 75 days, the enthusiasm came again. The first dry dock completed a major ship repair in 28 days, which was more than 30% more workload and 37% less time compared to the autumn of the year before last. The docking period for minor repairs used to be six days at the fastest, and generally seven or eight days, but this year it jumped to two days in April, a three-fold leap forward.

    The reason for the shortened docking period is due to reforms in various aspects: continuing to expand the amount of work outside the dock; worker Chen Fuxiang created a bottom-drilling machine, saving two workers and doubling efficiency; in the past, after the cabins were completed, water was tested, and it took seven or eight days to hand over one cabin in the past, but this year one cabin was handed over in four or five days. In April, the caulking workers collectively created a circulating water test handover method, handing over one cabin in one day.

    The dry dock cycle for building a 1,200-horsepower ocean-going tugboat has been shortened from 75 days for the first vessel to 35 days due to workers improving the old process methods.

    Electricians installing wires on a 300-horsepower passenger boat used to pull the main line first and then the branch line. One group of twelve people could only install the wires for two boats per month; now, they have opened their minds, and from late May to June, they have changed the process method, pulling the branch line first and then the main line. The same number of people can now do five boats per month.

    Technical Innovation is in Full Swing
    Usually, workers submit about 400 rationalization proposals per month, but in May it suddenly increased to 2,254. After the general line was promoted, 78% of the coppersmith workshop submitted rationalization proposals.

    A deaf-mute man named Zhang Renzheng in the boiler workshop never participated in activities. Seeing that everyone was innovating and creating, he also made an innovation proposal: changing the furnace of the boiler fire chamber to be longer, doubling efficiency and saving half of the coke.

    Su Boyang, a technician at the Central Laboratory, invented a thickness gauge. Countries around the world are studying this, but have not yet succeeded, but this factory has already put it into production.

    Technical personnel Shen Huidong and worker Yang Shihua transformed the automatic welding machine that could only do flat welding into one that could do horizontal welding, which is a great creation.

    In the electrical workshop, a worker named Guo Xintian sorted out 132 innovation suggestions in one night, 67 of which he thought of himself, and is known as the innovation king.

    Each workshop has one or two such people.

    The workers, cadres, and technical personnel of the forging workshop created a tire mold, which increased the efficiency of forging bearing sleeves from 400 to 2,400; forging crankshafts jumped from one per day to four; and also proposed the technical innovation direction of nine aspects for the workshop: mechanization of material transportation and work delivery; mechanization of furnace loading and unloading; universalization of forging hammer piers; automation of hammer operation; simplification of accounting, scheduling, and technology; universalization of tire molds; simplification of processing; popularization of technical and cultural learning; frequent technical innovation.

    The fitter section of the electrical workshop proposed to work hard for two months to universally use tire molds.

    Now all employees are ideologically liberated and full of energy, and are determined to design and trial-produce a 2,500-horsepower heavy-duty diesel engine this year, and design and trial-produce an 8,000-horsepower heavy-duty diesel engine in the first half of next year.

    大连造船厂在跃进
    ——大连工厂集锦之一
  　郑重
    随着整风运动的胜利，尤其是鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的深入人心，大连造船厂和其他工厂一样，出现了一个思想、生产跃进的新局面。
    干部作风大转变
    去年10月里，这个厂贴出大字报十三万张，其中有30％是批评各级领导干部作风的；今年双反运动又贴出大字报七十六万张，其中有35％左右也是批评领导干部作风的。
    过去工长都在楼上办公，命令主义多，群众路线少，重视政治也很少。现在工长搬在工人一起住，遇事大家同商量，和工人共同劳动。工人们把这称做工长下乡了。有一张大字报是修船船体车间工人表扬一个工段长转变作风的，写得很生动：
    态度蛮横又粗暴，
    不深入检查和指导，
    指手划脚乱批评，
    吹胡子瞪眼把毛病挑；
    弄得工人垂头丧气心烦躁，
    情绪低落生产劲头那能高？
    如今作风转变了，
    既能深入检查又具体指导，
    工人心眼痛快了，
    决心参加生产新高潮。
    再举一张表扬领导干部的，是锻工车间写的：
    锻工车间小又小，领导干部来不到；
    有些意见无处提，提了意见数不着；
    工人干部有一招，就把意见留着了。
    现在过去大不同，车间内部变了风。
    整风运动真伟大，领导上把车间下，
    每天见到李厂长，书记一天走一趟，
    工会主席不少到，团委书记也看见，
    谈到工作有问题，又给解决又指导，
    这种作风实在好，有事我们主动找。群众思想大改观
    经过大字报、大鸣大放、干部自我批评，作风转变，和工人中的大字报、大辩论、大对比，工人的觉悟普遍提高了。
    造船轮机车间有个工人叫杨成信，是工厂里的刘介梅。他原是一个乞儿，解放后当了工人，每月工资一百元。但在去年右派向党进攻时，他也反对党的统购统销政策……。后来工厂把他的事迹组织了一个展览后，有些落后工人很快就认错了，感觉对不起党，对不起人民。造船船体车间四个工段共有三十八名落后工人，现在已有二十九人转变，其中有十四人已成了先进工人；比较普遍的树立起：“我为人人，人人为我”的社会主义思想和风格。工人们说：“过去见面是讲吃讲穿；现在是讲干讲钻了。”修船船体车间工人刘喜功平时不好好干活，下班就回家，他在家里养了一百多只鸡，还雇了一个在家休养的工人替他看鸡，这两个工人每月除照领国家发给他们的工资外，刘喜功还额外收入一百八十多元。在大辩论会上刘喜功作了检讨后，把鸡都卖掉，并且把休养的工人也动员上班干活了。
    工人间的团结协作，大大加强了。电工车间和交船工段工人，过去被人称为“少爷兵”，没有事就看书、看小说，认为干多少都是给那些钱。为谁劳动的辩论后，早晨七点钟就上班干活，工人刘建堂看见船舶电气的工人很忙，冒着危险，主动爬到大桅杆上去帮助完成任务。
    工人的主人翁感提高了，很重视产品质量和材料节约，并能互相监督。
    不少工程技术人员的立场得到了改造，政治思想上的变化很大。交心、辩论后，社会主义占了上风，又红又专的口号很响亮，对资产阶级个人主义有了比较系统的暴露，中间分子纷纷向左转。技术科的一百六十多名技术人员都自愿下车间去和工人结合了。一个技术人员陆钻忠把自己经过整风的进步画成了九幅连环画，上面写着：
    一、上班钟声响，大驾还未到；工作压不少，我却自逍遥。
    二、人忙我不管，反把冷话讲，何以不开窍，不必累坏了。
    三、杂事最讨厌，我可顾不了； 管它大清扫，骑上“龙车”跑。
    四、开会更烦恼，找个暗角靠；扇摇烟缭绕，混混会就了。
    五、整风锣鼓响，交心如梦醒；认真深挖掘，决心来改造。
    六、赶早又贪黑，埋头又苦干；一批挖砂船，节约十五万。
    七、过去请也难，而今跑的欢；亲自到车间，来把问题钻。
    八、政治是统帅，思想翻一翻；发言真热烈，决心红与专。
    九、业务工作干劲足，社会工作也不差；搬到工人一起住，决心兴无和灭资。
    规章制度大改革
    这个工厂有许多不合理的规章制度，束缚了生产力的发展。整风鸣放以来，做了比较大胆的整改。如过去生产准备集中在厂部技术科，修船生产准备周期大修船都在四个月到六个月左右：从订货到验收的手续有七十六道。现在检修、配套、部分工艺下放到车间，订货手续简化，准备工作缩短到两个月。过去领取材料要经过十六道手续，每月材料票四万多张，现在简化为三道手续，最多的五道，人人称快，材料票也简为二万多张。过去会计科财权独揽，领一分钱都要到科里去，每日接待五百人次左右，全科一百多个工作人员还忙不过来；现在权力下放，不仅人称简便，全科人数精简为二十五人，而且增强了车间的经济观念，成本大为降低，1月到5月比1957年实际降低21％（可比产品成本）。过去是：签字手续繁多，一张图纸八个人签字，老工人批评为“三七二十八，领导马大哈，图纸桌上放，签字不检查……”，但是差错仍然百出。现在三个人签字，差错大大减少。
    工人干劲高，3月完成六百六十万，4月完成七百七十万，5月完成八百五十万，6月份就可能达到九百四十万，步步高升。船台周期大缩短
    修船的主要设备之一是船坞。1956年大修船平均占坞周期是六十八天，1957年是五十二天；今年提出缩短为四十二天，可是听说江南造船厂大修船由过去的二百零七天到二百一十天一下要缩短到七十五天以后，劲又来了，第一坞一只大修船二十八天就干完了，和前年秋天比较，工作量多了30％多，时间却缩短了37％多。小修理的坞期，过去最快是六天，一般要七、八天，今年4月一跃而为两天，跃进了三倍。
    占坞期缩短的原因是由于各方面的改革：继续扩大坞外作业的工作量；工人陈福祥创造了船底钻眼机，节省劳动力二名，提高效率一倍；过去舱做完了，再装水试验，一个舱过去是七、八天才能交工，今年四、五天交一个，4月份铲捻工人集体创造了循环试水交舱法，一天就交一个。
    造一千二百马力远洋拖船的船台周期由于工人改进了老的工艺方法，由第一艘的七十五天缩短三十五天。
    电工在三百马力客艇上安装电线，过去先拉总线，后拉分线，一个小组十二个人，每月只能安装两条船的电线；现在打开了脑筋，5月下旬到6月份以来，改变了工艺方法，先拉分线，再拉总线，同样的人数，每月能干到五条船。
    技术革新热火朝天
    平时工人每月提出的合理化建议有四百件左右，5月突然增至二千二百五十四件，总路线宣传以后，铜工车间78％的人提出了合理化建议。
    锅炉车间的一个哑吧张仁政，向来不参加活动，他看到大家都在革新、创造，也提了革新建议：围锅炉火室改长了炉子，效率增一倍，焦炭节省一半。
    中央试验室技师苏伯阳发明了测厚仪，现在这个东西各国都在研究，可是还没有成功，这个厂已经投入生产了。
    技术人员沈惠栋、工人杨世华，把只能平焊的自动电焊机改造成了能够横焊，这是一个大创造。
    电工车间有一个工人郭心田，一夜整理了一百三十二件革新建议，其中自己想的占六十七件，号称革新大王。
    这样的人各车间都有一两个。
    锻工车间的工人和干部、技术人员一起创造胎具，使锻轴承套效率，由四百个提高到二千四百个；打曲拐轴日打一根跃到四根；又提出了车间九化的技术革新方向：运料、送活机械化；装炉、出炉机械化；锻锤墩子万能化；开锤自动化；计、调、工艺简明化；胎模普遍化；加工简单化；技术文化学习普及化；技术革新经常化。
    电工车间钳工工段，提出苦战两个月普遍胎具化。
    现在全体职工是思想解放，干劲十足，一定要在今年自己设计和试制成二千五百马力的重型柴油机，明年上半年设计和试制八千马力的重型柴油机。
