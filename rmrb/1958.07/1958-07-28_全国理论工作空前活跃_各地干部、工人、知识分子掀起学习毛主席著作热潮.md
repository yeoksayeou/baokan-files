Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Under the situation of the great leap forward of socialist construction in our country, Marxist-Leninist theoretical work has also presented a new atmosphere. Throughout the country, from leading cadres to grassroots cadres in rural areas, to workers and intellectuals, an upsurge in studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works has been launched. Leading cadres at the central and local levels are taking the lead in giving lectures. Party committees of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have successively launched theoretical publications and established their own theoretical teams. Professionals in philosophy and social sciences are going among the workers and peasants, and into production. All these new atmospheres show that theoretical research and theoretical propaganda work have presented an unprecedentedly active situation.

    Provinces and Cities Launch Movement to Study Chairman Mao's Works
      and Summarize Experiences, Write Articles

At present, cadres and the masses in various places study theory, and resolutely adopt the policy of "taking the actual problems of the Chinese revolution as the center, and taking the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism as the guide." The provincial party committees of Guangdong, Sichuan, Hubei, Qinghai, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Hebei, Jiangxi and other nine provinces have made decisions or issued instructions and notices, stipulating that Chairman Mao's works are the main content of cadre theoretical study. The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee held a plenary meeting to discuss the issue of ideological liberation, and believed that an important reason why the ideological level of the party in Guangdong has not been raised quickly enough is that they have not studied Chairman Mao's works and instructions seriously enough. Therefore, it was decided to launch a movement to study Chairman Mao's works seriously within the party throughout the province. The meeting stipulated that Chairman Mao's works in recent years should be compiled and printed and distributed to cadres above the county party secretary level for study, and it was stipulated that these cadres should be transferred in turn to leave their posts for one and a half months of study every year, with the provincial party secretaries taking turns to participate in the leadership. The first training class decided to start on August 10, under the leadership of Tao Zhu, first secretary of the provincial party committee, and Qu Mengjue, secretary. In the future, each phase should have two provincial party secretaries responsible for leading the study. Other provincial party committees all emphasized that cadres above the county party committee should seriously study Chairman Mao's works, and combine theoretical study with the study of practical problems, criticism of bourgeois ideology, summary of work experience, writing articles, and making reports, so that cadre theoretical study becomes an important method of studying practical problems, guiding current work, and conducting ideological struggle.

In terms of learning methods, the previous uniform form of reading, listening to lectures, and compiling groups according to several course systems has also been changed, and various and more flexible forms and methods have been adopted, such as recommending reading lists, individuals subscribing to red and expert plans, running lectures, running red and expert schools, and establishing research groups or writing groups. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee launched a writing movement of "ten thousand articles and one thousand books" throughout the province. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee proposed to launch a writing movement of "ten thousand experiences or articles" among cadres above the county party committee member level in the province. The cadres of the Jiujiang Prefectural Committee have already written more than 300 articles. The Zhejiang Provincial Propaganda, Culture and Education and Town Rectification Conference held not long ago, the responsible cadres of the cultural and educational departments of the prefectural, municipal, and county party committees and some town party committee secretaries who participated in the meeting wrote more than 140 papers on studying the general line during the meeting, breaking the superstition that workers, peasants, and cadres cannot write papers. They believe that this method of learning, discussing, and writing at the same time is a good method of learning theory in connection with practice. In order to promote and help cadres conduct theoretical research and write special papers, seven provincial and municipal party committees, including Shaanxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hebei, Liaoning, Qinghai, and Shanghai, have proposed hundreds of reference topics based on the problems in the socialist revolution and construction in the country and locally.

      Workers and Rural Grassroots Cadres
          Enthusiastically Study Theory

At present, the working masses and rural grassroots cadres in many places have broken the mystical idea that "workers and peasants can't understand theory" and "theory is too high to reach" with vivid examples.

Eleven worker philosophy groups in the Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard taught and learned from each other, reading Chairman Mao's works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Contradiction," and "On Practice." Encouraged by them, workers in Shanghai successively established philosophy groups to study philosophy in connection with reality. After the news from Shanghai reached Tianjin, the workers of the Tianjin Renli Woolen Mill organized a philosophy study class two days later. Subsequently, many factories in Tianjin also prepared to set up philosophy study classes or groups. Since Chairman Mao's article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was published last year, the Sanming Weaving Factory and the Daxin Cloth Factory have already had several workers studying philosophy and discussing philosophical issues, and now the workers are asking to organize to study. Li Changmao, an old worker at the Renli Woolen Mill, said after learning a little philosophy, "I thought philosophy was very mysterious before I learned it. Once I learned it and connected it with reality, it was no longer mysterious." "Philosophy is not mysterious, and we can learn it too," is the conclusion of the workers at the Renli Woolen Mill. Workers in Harbin are also very active in learning philosophy. The city's trade union runs a workers' spare-time philosophy class with 300 students, most of whom are advanced producers and model workers. In the Xiangfang District of the city, many workers, shop assistants, and service personnel study philosophy. Only four units, such as the Harbin Steel Rolling Mill, Songjiang Plywood Factory, Automobile Company, and Xiangfang District Service Bureau, have established 20 philosophy groups, with 280 employees participating in the study. A cement factory in Mudanjiang City (Mudanjiang Cement Factory) has 33 theory study groups for workers and their families, including 27 worker groups with 415 people, accounting for 48% of the factory's employees. They study by the Mudanjiang River every morning and are currently studying the general line of socialist construction. The workers sang in poems: "Every worker is a student, getting up at half past four, holding books and sitting by the river, everyone is learning the general line." And put forward such a bold slogan: "We must turn the cement factory into not only a factory, but also a university, and also a Marxist-Leninist college."

The countryside is not lagging behind either. The cadres of San Guan Miao Township in Dengfeng, Henan, compiled their own teaching materials for studying philosophy. After studying philosophy for two months, "there are more investigations and studies, less subjectivism, and a stronger mass viewpoint." The secretary of the Xiangtan Miluo Township Party Committee in Hunan (with a primary school education, from a peasant background) explained the law of unity of opposites with concrete examples in production and work at the summary work meeting.

These situations all show that Chairman Mao's philosophical works will gradually become the key to inspiring the wisdom of the general working masses. At present, there are more than one million workers and peasants in Heilongjiang Province alone studying political theory and Chairman Mao's works. The characteristics of their learning are: "What is needed, study what, study while debating, examine while acting." Therefore, theoretical study has become an important method for them to improve their thinking and improve their work. Therefore, they said: "The more you learn, the more you love to learn."

Among the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a new thing like "an ordinary soldier talks about philosophy" has also emerged (see our report on July 13).

In the "march" towards theory, the Communist Youth League members and young workers are active members. According to incomplete statistics from ten cities and prefectural committees including Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, and Tieling in Liaoning Province alone, more than 2,600 Chairman Mao's works and philosophy study groups have been established, with more than 50,000 people participating in the study. The young people in Beijing launched a reading movement to study Chairman Mao's works.

      Intellectuals Also Enthusiastically Ask to Study
          Marxism-Leninism

A new upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works and Marxism-Leninism has begun to appear among intellectuals. Teachers and students in many universities and colleges such as Peking University, Beijing Normal University, Renmin University of China, Wuhan University, and Fudan University have universally and spontaneously established Chairman Mao's Works Research Associations or groups. More than 2,100 political theory study groups have been established in Beijing universities and colleges. Peking University alone has sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, with 392 Marxist-Leninist study groups, most of which are Chairman Mao's works study groups, as well as bourgeois academic thought criticism groups and Yugoslav revisionism criticism groups. 80% of the teachers and students in the school participate. Beijing Normal University has also established more than 300 theoretical study and research groups. The teachers and students of the philosophy departments of these two schools also helped the workers in the school to run worker philosophy study groups. At present, more than 2,100 political theory study groups centered on studying Chairman Mao's works have been established in universities and colleges and secondary specialized schools in Beijing.

Recently, many universities and colleges have summarized the teaching work of political theory courses and formulated preliminary plans for future improvements. All schools have emphasized that they must resolutely implement the policy of focusing on the study of practical revolutionary problems in China and guiding them with the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, and clarified that the fundamental task of political theory course teaching is to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and establish class viewpoints, mass viewpoints, labor viewpoints, and dialectical materialist viewpoints. In order to study and improve teaching content and exchange experiences, teaching research associations of socialist education courses and collaborative associations of several theoretical courses have been established in Shanghai, Beijing and other places. At present, universities and colleges are carrying out further revolutionary changes in the teaching system, that is, implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor. Many schools are considering how to enable political theory courses to complete the tasks they should shoulder in the new situation.

  Central and Local Leading Cadres Take the Lead in Giving Lectures

Another new atmosphere in theoretical work is that it has broken the superstition of "being afraid of professors" and "being afraid of the highest institutions." Many central and local leading comrades have taken the lead in giving lectures in universities and colleges. At the same time, many veteran cadres with practical work experience have served as teachers or become the backbone of the full-time theoretical work team, thereby changing the past situation of mainly relying on young intellectuals as full-time teachers.

The leading comrades and senior cadres who gave lectures in Beijing universities and colleges include: Lu Dingyi, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Minister of Propaganda (Beijing Normal University), Kang Sheng, alternate member of the Political Bureau (Renmin University of China), Chen Boda, alternate member of the Political Bureau and Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department (Peking University), Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department (Peking University), Zhang Zhuyi, Deputy Minister of the Central United Front Work Department (Renmin University of China), Huang Songling, Deputy Minister of Education (Renmin University of China), etc. According to local newspapers, there are more than 60 leading comrades in Shanghai who taught at universities and colleges, including Ke Qingshi, first secretary of the municipal party committee, and Wei Wenbo and Xu Jianguo, secretaries (above Fudan University), and ministers of various departments of the municipal party committee. Jiangsu has Jiang Weiqing, first secretary of the provincial party committee (Nanjing University), Liu Shunyuan, Hui Yuyu, Chen Guang, and eleven members of the provincial party committee (employed by Nanjing Agricultural College, East China Institute of Water Conservancy, Jiangsu Education Institute, and Nanjing Institute of Technology, respectively). Hubei has Wang Renzhong, first secretary of the provincial party committee, and Zhang Pinghua, secretary (Wuhan University). Shanxi has Tao Lujia, first secretary of the provincial party committee (Shanxi Normal College). Jilin has Wu De, first secretary of the provincial party committee, and Fu Zhensheng, secretary (Northeast People's University). Fujian has Ye Fei, first secretary of the provincial party committee (Fujian Normal College). Guangdong has Tao Zhu, first secretary of the provincial party committee, Qu Mengjue, secretary (above South China Normal College), and Zhao Ziyang (South China Agricultural College), etc. Shaanxi has Fang Zhongru, secretary of the provincial party committee. Zhejiang has Lin Hujia, Li Fengping, and other secretaries of the provincial party committee.

The party committees of universities and colleges in various places have strengthened the leadership of political theory course teaching. Many party committee secretaries and party member presidents and principals concurrently serve as political theory course teachers, and some also concurrently serve as directors of political course teaching and research offices. Lu Ping, first secretary of the Peking University Party Committee, led the work of political courses himself. Many party school principals and party committee secretaries who rarely lectured in the past also decided to lecture and directly lead the work of the teaching and research office. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee Primary Party School reorganized the original Organization Department, the Academic Affairs Department, and five teaching and research offices into one teaching and research office, under the direct leadership of the party committee secretary (vice principal), to unify the teaching and ideological work of each class. Each class is equipped with a full-time class teacher, and some class teachers also teach courses.

      Theoretical Publications Like Bamboo Shoots After a Rain

The establishment of the theoretical journal "Red Flag" sponsored by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is a major event of utmost importance in my country's theoretical work. Following the publication of "Red Flag," the party committees of 23 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have launched theoretical publications. This is a significant sign of the prosperity and development of Marxist-Leninist theoretical work in our country. Henan's "Zhongzhou Review," Jiangxi's "Leap Forward," Liaoning's "Theoretical Study," Hebei's "East Wind," Zhejiang's "Seeking Truth," Qinghai's "Red and Expert," Shaanxi's "Ideological Front," Gansu's "Red Star," Shanxi's "Advance," Hubei's "July 1," Hunan's "Learning Guide," Sichuan's "Upstream," Jilin's "Striving," Heilongjiang's "Struggle," Inner Mongolia's "Practice," and Shanghai's "Liberation" have been published, and many responsible comrades have personally written articles. Guizhou's "Unity," Yunnan's "Creation," and Jiangsu's "Masses" will be published this month. Anhui's "Truth and Falsehood," Guangdong's "Upstream," and Shandong's "New Analects" will be launched on August 1. These publications are directly led by the provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional party committees. The theoretical publications of Shandong and Shanxi are personally led by the first secretary of the provincial party committee.

At present, many prefectural committees have launched theoretical publications, and many county party committees have also launched theoretical publications. In the more than ten kinds of theoretical publications that have been published, many provincial and municipal leading comrades and comrades working at the grassroots level have written articles. These publications, either in the inaugural speech or in special papers, have elaborated on the issue of strengthening theoretical work, pointing out that it is necessary to break the mystical concept and superstitious thoughts about theory, and resolutely implement the mass line of theoretical work.

The original academic publications in Beijing, Shanghai and other places have also begun to change the situation of limiting the readers of publications to a small number of academic workers, paying attention to facing the masses, facing reality, organizing cadres with practical work experience to write articles for the publications, paying attention to publishing articles studying current practical problems, and paying attention to improving writing styles. "Philosophical Research," "Economic Research," and "Academic Monthly" are all working in this direction.

    Various Places Universally Establish Their Own Theoretical Teams

Provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have successively formulated plans and adopted measures to establish their own theoretical work teams that are both red and expert. In addition to training a large number of full-time theoretical work cadres, various places also pay attention to training more part-time theoretical work cadres who do practical work. Fifteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions including Shanghai, Beijing, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Fujian, Shandong, Qinghai, Sichuan, Henan, Jilin, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia are preparing to train more than 35,000 people during the second five-year plan period, of which Hunan plans to train 15,000 people and Jiangxi plans to train 10,000 people. In addition, the full-time theoretical work team is planned to train about 10,000 people in Jiangxi, Hunan, Jilin, Guangdong, Shanxi, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Beijing. The 500 people directly managed by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee are required to be able to independently teach a political theory course, independently conduct scientific research, write books, and frequently write articles for newspapers and magazines within five years in party schools and colleges. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee put forward a "ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand" plan, stipulating that ten theoretical work experiences should be summarized within this year; more than one hundred articles with high theoretical level should be created; more than one thousand articles should be written to promote Marxism-Leninism in response to practical problems; and tens of thousands of part-time and full-time theoretical course teachers should be trained. They also stipulated that within five years, 50 philosophers, 100 political economists, 50 jurists, 70 historians (including 50 in the history of the Communist Party of China), 50 literary theorists, and 100 educators, a total of 470 people, should be trained. The Hunan Provincial Party Committee requires that 10% of the 1,900 full-time theoretical cadres reach a higher level within five years. The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee requires that 500 of the 2,000 people be trained to reach the level of lecturers within five years. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee requires that 500 people reach the level of lecturers or above within five years.

In addition to stipulating that leading comrades should take the lead and veteran cadres should be the backbone, the measures for establishing a theoretical team also include the following:

      (1) Establish societies, set up theoretical studios, and organize writing groups. Shanghai, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and other regions have established or are about to establish various societies of philosophy and social sciences. The Beijing Municipal Party Committee decided to set up theoretical studios in the municipal party committee, district party committees, party committees of large factories and enterprises, and university and college party committees, forming a full-time theoretical team of more than 100 people under the direct leadership of the party committee secretary to conduct theoretical research and theoretical propaganda around the central work of the party committee. Many regions have established or decided to establish writing groups and theoretical research groups, which combine talking about problems, writing articles, and studying documents.

    (2) Open reading lists, run lectures and stipulate writing holidays. Shanghai opened a batch of reading lists for members of the theoretical team, gave them two months of vacation each year for investigation and research, and held lectures and night universities for them. A certain writing holiday is given for those who want to write important articles or books. Shanxi stipulates that full-time teachers should strive to go to party school for study once every two years. Jiangxi stipulates that some responsible comrades can be given writing holidays with the approval of the prefectural party committee or above. Hunan has also decided to implement a creation holiday system.

    (3) Formulate plans for writing articles and books, and organize academic criticism. Guangdong requires that 2,000 special research articles be written in the province this year, of which at least 200 are of good quality. Jiangxi requires that 1,000 articles be written this year, of which 100 are of good quality, and strive to write 50 to 100 books on philosophy, political economy, party history, law, education, and literary theory, and 2,000 popular Marxist-Leninist pamphlets within five years. Shanghai requires that the compilation of ten political theory textbooks be started this year, and strive to complete ten historical works within five years. The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee decided to launch a "writing a thousand articles movement" centered on summarizing practical experience among leading cadres at all levels above the county party committee secretary in the province. The Shanghai and Jiangxi Provincial Party Committees have formulated specific plans to carry out academic criticism.

      (4) Organize participation in labor, participate in grassroots work, organize investigations and research, and link up with business departments. Shanghai, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces and cities stipulate that full-time theory teachers should spend a certain amount of time going to the countryside and factories. Shanxi and Hunan stipulate that teachers should go down for at least three months each year; Jiangxi stipulates that they should go down for at least one to two years within five years; Liaoning stipulates that theory course teachers should take part in some work in the department, factory, rural area; Shanghai stipulates that school teachers should report to business departments and undertake certain scientific research tasks entrusted by business departments.

Party school is an important base for training theoretical work teams. In recent years, many party schools have had different degrees of tendencies to teach Marxism-Leninism in isolation and statically, and to "run schools behind closed doors." After rectification, this situation has changed. Party schools in various places have formulated great leap forward plans, requiring hard work for several years to change their appearance. The Gansu Provincial Party Committee Intermediate Party School requires "hard work for three years," "becoming red and expert," and "training a fighting team to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology." The party school stipulates that after four months of study in each phase in the future, students and teachers will go to the countryside together to participate in winter production and year-end evaluation work for three months, and then return to school to study for four months. It is also stipulated that all teaching cadres should take turns to serve as county party committee and township party committee secretaries, and return to school to give lectures several times a year during their tenure. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Party School requires that textbooks or teaching materials on philosophy, political economy, and the history of the Communist Party of China for middle and elementary cadres be compiled within three to five years, and 85 special works and popular reading materials be written within three years. The slogan of this party school is:
  "Work hard for one year to achieve a great reform in teaching work and a great leap forward in teaching quality," "Work hard for three years to become a powerful assistant to the municipal party committee in theoretical research, summarizing experience, and training cadres," "Work hard for five years to become one of the important bases of the Marxist-Leninist ideological and theoretical front of the municipal party committee." New atmospheres have emerged in the party schools that have already started. Many party schools are full of energy, and in the future, in addition to setting up training courses, they will also add theory teacher training courses, theory backbone research courses, middle school political teacher training courses, advanced cadre self-study courses, and short training courses for various businesses. Some will also hold lectures, night party schools, and spare-time night schools (Shanghai, Yunnan, Jiangsu), and give lectures in factories and rural areas (Yunnan).

      Professional Philosophy and Social Science Workers
    Go to the Workers, Peasants and Masses, and Go to Production

Another aspect of the new atmosphere in theoretical work is that the atmosphere of professional philosophy and social science workers going deep into the grassroots, going deep into the production front, and closely integrating with the workers, peasants, and masses is taking shape. In mid-May, the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences organized more than 340 researchers from its various institutes, led by Pan Zinian and Liu Daosheng, deputy directors of the department, to "dismount and observe the flowers" in Changli, Jinghai, Wuqing and other places in Hebei Province. The great leap forward in local agricultural production and various rural work, and the revolutionary enthusiasm and pioneering spirit of the peasant masses and rural cadres, gave the philosophy and social science workers great inspiration and encouragement, and greatly promoted the discussion of the great leap forward plan of each institute. This method of organizing a large number of philosophy and social science workers to dismount and observe the flowers will be used frequently in the future.

In the face of the new atmosphere of workers and peasants learning philosophy, philosophy workers urgently demand to go deep into rural factories. Many units have organized many philosophy workers to go to rural areas and factories to work with the workers, peasants and masses, study philosophy together, summarize work together, and compile philosophy lectures that meet the urgent needs of the workers, peasants and masses. Researchers from the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have gone to rural areas such as Yanshi and Dengfeng in Henan, and Xushui in Hebei to establish contacts. The institute has also initially established cooperative relations with the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. Some philosophy workers are cooperating with the party committee secretaries of some factories to summarize work, study problems, and write philosophical papers. Ai Siqi, director of the Philosophy Teaching and Research Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Higher Party School, lectured on "How to Learn Philosophy" to workers in more than 100 factories in Tianjin, and Sun Dingguo, deputy director, also lectured on philosophy in the Tianjin Renli Woolen Mill and the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory.

Economic science workers have also gone out of the research room and gone deep into the grassroots. Economist Jiang Junchen and other staff members of the Science and Technology Planning Commission of the State Council have recently participated in the movement to summarize work in Xushui County, Hebei, and Yanbei Prefecture, Shanxi. Researchers from the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently participated in the on-site meeting of financial and trade work held in Xinhui, Guangdong. The institute believes that a large part of the future research work should be carried out in counties, districts, agricultural cooperatives, and factories, rather than in the research room. Going deep into the grassroots, going deep into the front line, analyzing the situation on the spot under the guidance of the local party organization, discovering problems, collecting materials, and conducting research can better implement the policy of combining theory with practice and scientific research serving socialist construction and serving production. Therefore, they are preparing to organize more researchers to go to factories and rural areas recently.

The philosophy and social science departments of universities and colleges are also drafting methods to enable all teachers and students to frequently contact reality. The philosophy department of Peking University has decided that all teachers and students should go to the countryside for one year to participate in production labor and conduct investigations and research. Other departments and other universities have similar plans.

In the struggle to criticize modern revisionism, many professional workers in philosophy and social sciences have made serious analysis and criticism of the South Communist program, and have held meetings to refute the anti-Marxist fallacies of this thorough modern revisionist program.

### 全国理论工作空前活跃  各地干部、工人、知识分子掀起学习毛主席著作热潮

    全国理论工作空前活跃
    各地干部、工人、知识分子掀起学习毛主席著作热潮
    本报综合报道　在我国社会主义事业大跃进的形势下，马克思列宁主义理论工作，也出现了一片新气象。各地从领导干部到农村基层干部、工人群众和知识分子，都掀起了学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席著作的热潮。中央和地方的领导干部都带头讲课。各省、市、自治区党委纷纷创办理论刊物，建立自己的理论队伍。哲学社会科学专业工作者到工农群众中去，到生产中去。所有这些新气象，都表明理论研究和理论宣传工作已经出现了空前活跃的局面。
    各省、市开展学习毛主席著作
      和总结经验、写作文章的运动
    目前各地干部和群众学习理论，都坚决采取了“以中国革命实际问题为中心、以马克思列宁主义基本原则为指导”的方针。广东、四川、湖北、青海、福建、江苏、陕西、河北、江西等九个省委作出决定或发出指示、通知，规定了以毛主席著作为干部理论学习的主要内容。广东省委曾召开全体会议谈思想解放问题，认为广东党内思想水平提高得不够快的一个重要原因，是对毛主席的著作、指示学习得不够认真，因而决定在全省党内认真展开学习毛主席著作的运动。这次会议规定编印毛主席近几年来的著作，发给县委书记以上干部学习，并规定轮流抽调这些干部每年离职学习一个半月，由省委书记轮流参加领导。第一期学习班，决定在8月10日开学，由省委第一书记陶铸、书记区梦觉负责领导。以后每期要有两个省委书记负责领导学习。其他省委都强调县委以上干部要认真学习毛主席著作，把学习理论和研究实际问题、批判资产阶级思想、总结工作经验、写文章、作报告结合起来，使干部理论学习成为研究实际问题、指导当前工作和进行思想斗争的重要方法之一。
    在学习方法上，也改变了过去那种按照几门课程体系，读书、听讲和编小组的千篇一律的形式，采取多种多样、比较灵活的形式和办法，如推荐书目、个人订红专规划、办讲座、办红专学校、成立研究小组或写作小组等。山西省委在全省开展一个“万篇文章、千本书”的写作运动。河北省委提出在全省县委委员以上干部中，展开一个“万篇经验或文章”的写作运动。九江地委的干部已经写了三百多篇文章。不久以前召开的浙江省宣传文教和城镇整风会议，参加会议的地、市、县委的文教部门的负责干部和部分镇委书记，在会议期间写出了一百四十余篇关于学习总路线的论文，打破了工农干部不能写论文的迷信。他们认为这种边学、边议、边写的方法，是联系实际学习理论的好方法。为了推动和帮助干部进行理论研究和撰写专题论文，目前已有陕西、贵州、四川、河北、辽宁、青海和上海等七个省市委，根据全国和本地在社会主义革命和建设中的问题，提出了几百个参考题目。
      工人和农村基层干部
          学习理论的热情高涨
    目前许多地方的工人群众和农村基层干部，已经以生动的事例，破除了“工农群众学不懂理论”、“理论高不可攀”的神秘观念。
    上海求新造船厂十一个工人哲学小组，互教互学，读毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“矛盾论”、“实践论”等著作。在他们鼓舞下，上海市工人纷纷成立哲学小组，结合实际地学哲学。上海的消息传到天津后，天津仁立毛织厂工人两天后就组织起来哲学学习班。接着，天津市许多工厂也筹办哲学学习班或小组。三明织布厂、大新布厂从去年毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”文章发表后，就已经有几个工人学习哲学、经常谈论哲学问题了，现在工人们要求组织起来学习。仁立毛织厂老工人李长茂在学了一点哲学之后，说“哲学不学时以为很神秘，一学，一联系实际，就没有什么神秘了”。“哲学不神秘，我们也能学”，这是仁立毛织厂工人的结论。哈尔滨市工人学哲学也很活跃。该市工会办了一所工人业余哲学班，有三百名学员，大部分是先进生产者和劳动模范。该市香坊区有许多工人、店员、服务业人员学哲学，仅哈尔滨轧钢厂、松江胶合板厂、汽车公司、香坊区服务局等四个单位，就成立了二十个哲学小组，参加学习的职工有二百八十人。牡丹江市的一个水泥厂（牡丹江水泥厂），有三十三个工人及家属理论学习小组，其中工人的小组二十七个，四百一十五人，占该厂职工人数的48％。他们每天清早到牡丹江边学习，目前正在学习社会主义建设总路线。工人作诗歌唱道：“每个工人当学员，起床都在四点半，拿着书本坐江边，人人学习总路线。”并且提出这样豪迈的口号：“要把水泥厂变成既是工厂，又是大学，也是马列学院。”
    农村也不落后。河南登封三官庙乡的干部学哲学自编讲义，学了两个月哲学后，“调查研究多了，主观主义少了，群众观点加强了”。湖南湘潭汨罗乡党委书记（高小文化程度，农民出身），在总结工作的会上，用生产和工作中的具体事例讲解对立统一的规律。
    这些情况都说明了，毛主席的哲学著作将逐步成为启发一般劳动群众的智慧的钥匙。目前仅黑龙江省就有一百万以上的工人和农民学习政治理论、学习毛主席著作。他们学习的特点是：“需要啥，学习啥，边学习，边辩论，边检查，边行动”，因而理论学习成了他们提高思想改进工作的重要方法。因此，他们说：“越学越爱学。”
    在中国人民解放军战士中，也出现了“普通一兵讲哲学”这样的新事物（见本报7月13日报道）。
    在向理论“进军”中，共青团员、青年职工是积极分子。仅辽宁省的沈阳、旅大、安东、铁岭等十个市和地委的不完全统计，目前已建立了毛主席著作和哲学学习小组两千六百多个，参加学习的在五万人以上。北京的青年们展开了学习毛主席著作的读书运动。
      知识分子也热烈要求学习
          马克思列宁主义
    知识分子中目前已经开始出现了学习毛主席著作，学习马克思列宁主义新的高潮。北京大学、北京师范大学、中国人民大学、武汉大学、复旦大学等许多高等学校的师生，都普遍地、自发地成立了毛主席著作研究会或小组。北京高等学校共建立了两千一百多个政治理论学习小组。仅北京大学就如雨后春笋一般涌现出三百九十二个马列主义学习小组，其中多数是毛主席著作学习小组，还有资产阶级学术思想批判小组，批判南斯拉夫修正主义小组。全校师生有80％的人参加。北京师范大学也建立了三百多个理论学习和研究小组。这两个学校的哲学系师生，并且帮助校内的工人搞工人学哲学的小组。目前北京市高等学校和中等专业学校已经成立了以学习毛主席著作为中心的政治理论学习小组二千一百多个。
    最近许多高等学校都总结了政治理论课的教学工作，制定了今后改进的初步规划。各校都强调了必须坚决贯彻以研究中国实际革命问题为中心、以马列主义基本原则为指导的方针，明确了政治理论课教学的根本任务是兴无灭资、树立阶级观点、群众观点、劳动观点和辩证唯物观点。为了研究和改进教学内容和交流经验，上海、北京等地已经建立了社会主义教育课程教学研究会和几门理论课程的协作会。目前高等学校正在进行教学制度的进一步的革命性的变革，即贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。许多学校正在考虑如何使政治理论课程在新的形势下完成自己应担负的任务。
  中央和地方的领导干部带头讲课
    理论工作的另一新气象，是破除了“害怕教授”“害怕最高学府”的迷信，许多中央和地方的领导同志带头到高等院校讲课。同时，许多有实际工作经验的老干部兼任了教员，或成为专职理论工作队伍的骨干，从而改变了过去主要依靠青年知识分子专任教员的情况。
    在北京高等学校讲课的领导同志和高级干部有：中共中央政治局候补委员、宣传部长陆定一（北京师范大学）、政治局候补委员康生（中国人民大学）、政治局候补委员、中央宣传部副部长陈伯达（北京大学）、中央宣传部副部长周扬（北京大学）、中央统战部副部长张执一（中国人民大学）、教育部副部长黄松龄（中国人民大学）等。各地到高等院校任教的领导同志，据地方报纸报道，上海有市委第一书记柯庆施、书记魏文伯、许建国（以上复旦大学）和市委各部部长等六十余人。江苏有省委第一书记江渭清（南京大学）、书记刘顺元、惠浴宇、陈光和省委委员等十一人（分别受聘南京农学院、华东水利学院、江苏教育学院、南京工学院）。湖北有省委第一书记王任重、书记张平化（武汉大学）。山西有省委第一书记陶鲁笳（山西师范学院）。吉林有省委第一书记吴德、书记富振声（东北人民大学）。福建有省委第一书记叶飞（福建师范学院）。广东有省委第一书记陶铸、书记区梦觉（以上华南师范学院）、赵紫阳（华南农学院）等。陕西有省委书记方仲如。浙江有省委书记林乎加、李丰平等。
    各地高等院校党委加强了政治理论课教学工作领导。不少党委书记和党员院、校长兼任政治理论课教员，有的还兼任了政治课教研室主任。北京大学党委第一书记陆平自己领导政治课的工作。许多过去很少讲课的党校校长、党委书记，也决定要讲课，并直接领导教研室的工作。辽宁省委初级党校，将原有组织处、教务处及五个教研室改组合为一个教研室，在党委书记（副校长）直接领导下，统一领导各班教学与思想工作。各班设专职班主任，有的班主任也兼课。
      雨后春笋似的理论刊物
    中共中央主办的理论刊物“红旗”的创办，是我国理论工作具有头等重要意义的大事情。继“红旗”出版之后，已有二十三个省、市、自治区党委创办理论刊物。这是我国马克思列宁主义理论工作繁荣和发展的显著标志。河南的“中州评论”，江西的“跃进”，辽宁的“理论学习”，河北的“东风”，浙江的“求是”，青海的“红与专”，陕西的“思想战线”，甘肃的“红星”，山西的“前进”，湖北的“七一”，湖南的“学习导报”，四川的“上游”，吉林的“奋进”，黑龙江的“奋斗”，内蒙古的“实践”和上海的“解放”已经出版，有不少书记负责同志亲自动手写了文章。贵州的“团结”，云南的“创造”，江苏的“群众”，即将在本月内出版。安徽的“虚与实”，广东的“上游”，山东的“新论语”，将于8月1日创刊。这些刊物都由省、市、自治区党委直接领导。山东和山西的理论刊物，由省委第一书记亲自挂帅。
    目前许多地委都办了理论刊物，许多县委也办了理论刊物，在已出版的十几种理论刊物中，有许多省、市领导同志和做基层工作的同志写了文章。这些刊物，或在发刊词中，或在专门论文中，都阐述了加强理论工作的问题，指出必须破除对理论的神秘观念和迷信思想，坚决贯彻理论工作的群众路线。
    北京、上海等地原有的学术刊物，也开始改变那种把刊物读者局限于少数学术工作者的状况，注意面向群众，面向实际，组织有实际工作经验的干部为刊物写稿，注意发表研究当前实际问题的文章，注意改进文风。“哲学研究”“经济研究”“学术月刊”等都在朝这个方向努力。
    各地普遍建立自己的理论队伍
    各省、市、自治区，都纷纷制定规划、采取措施，建立自己又红又专的理论工作队伍。各地除培养大量的专职理论工作干部外，同时注意培养更多的、做实际工作的兼职的理论工作干部。上海、北京、江西、广东、湖南、山西、陕西、福建、山东、青海、四川、河南、吉林、辽宁、内蒙古等十五个省、市、自治区准备在第二个五年计划期间，共培养三万五千余人，其中湖南拟培养一万五千人，江西拟培养一万人。此外，专职理论工作队伍，江西、湖南、吉林、广东、山西、青海、内蒙古和北京等地共拟培养一万人左右。上海市委直接管理的五百人，要求五年内能在党校和大专学校中独立地担任一门政治理论课，独立地进行科学研究工作、写出著作，并经常给报刊写文章。江西省委提出了“十、百、千、万”的规划，规定今年内总结十条理论工作经验；创作百篇以上理论水平较高的文章；写出千篇以上针对实际问题宣传马列主义的文章；培养数以万计的兼职和专职的理论课程教员队伍。他们还规定五年内要培养出哲学家五十名，政治经济学家一百名，法学家五十名，历史学家七十名（包括中共党史五十名），文艺理论家五十名，教育家一百名，共四百七十名。湖南省委要求五年内在一千九百名专职理论干部中，10％达到更高的水平。陕西省委要求五年内在二千人中，培养五百人达到讲师水平。山东省委要求五年内有五百人达到讲师以上水平。
    建立理论队伍的措施，各地除规定领导同志带头、老干部作骨干外，还采取了以下的一些措施：
      （1）建立学会，设立理论工作室，组织写作小组。上海、江西、广东、福建、青海、内蒙古等地区已经或即将成立哲学、社会科学的各种学会。北京市委决定在市委、区委、大工厂企业党委和高等学校党委设立理论工作室，在党委书记直接领导下，组成一支一百多人的专职理论队伍，围绕党委的中心工作进行理论研究和理论宣传。许多地区已经建立或决定建立写作小组、理论研究小组，这些小组都是把谈问题、写文章、学文件等结合起来。
    （2）开书目，办讲座和规定写作假期。上海为理论队伍成员开了一批阅读书目，每年给两个月假期进行调查研究，并为他们举办讲座和夜大学。要写重要文章或著作的，另给一定的创作假期。山西规定专职教员争取两年内轮流进党校学习一次。江西规定有些负责同志经地委以上党委批准，可给写作假期。湖南也决定实行创作假期制度。
    （3）制订写文章和著书的计划，组织学术批判。广东要求今年全省写出两千篇专题研究文章，其中质量好的至少二百篇。江西要求今年写出千篇文章，其中质量好的一百篇，并在五年内争取写出哲学、政治经济学、党史、法学、教育学、文艺理论著作五十至一百本，马克思列宁主义通俗小册子二千本。上海要求今年着手编写十种政治理论教科书，争取五年完成十种史料著作。云南省委决定在全省县委书记以上各级领导干部中，开展以总结实践经验为中心的“写作千篇文章运动”。上海、江西省委都制定了开展学术批判的具体计划。
      （4）组织参加劳动、参加基层工作，组织调查研究，和业务部门挂钩。上海、山西、陕西、辽宁、湖南、江西等省市规定专职理论教员要有一定时间下乡下厂。山西、湖南规定教员每年至少下去三个月；江西规定五年内至少下去一年至二年；辽宁规定理论课教员要下班系、工厂农村担任一部分工作；上海规定学校教师要到业务部门作报告，并担任业务部门委托的一定的科学研究任务。
    党校是培养理论工作队伍的一个重要基地。近几年来，许多党校程度不同地出现过孤立地、静止地教学马列主义和“关门办校”的倾向。经过整风，这种情况已有转变。各地党校都制定了跃进规划，要求苦干几年，改变面貌。甘肃省委中级党校要求“苦战三年”，“红透专深”，“培养出一支兴无灭资的战斗队伍”。这个党校规定今后每期学习四个月后，学员和教员一起下乡参加冬季大生产和年终评比工作三个月，返校后再学四个月。还规定教学干部要全部轮流下去担任县委、乡党委书记，在下去任职期间内，每年回校讲几次课。上海市委党校要求三五年内编出中、初级干部用的哲学、政治经济学、中共党史教科书或教材，三年内写出八十五本专题著作和通俗读物。这个党校的口号是：
  “苦干一年，做到教学工作大改革，教学质量大跃进”，“苦干三年，在理论研究、总结经验和培养干部方面，成为市委的有力助手”，“苦干五年，成为市委马列主义思想理论战线的重要基地之一”。目前已开学的党校，都出现了新气象。许多党校鼓足干劲，今后除设轮训班外，将要增设理论教员进修班、理论骨干研究班、中学政治教员训练班、高级干部自修班及各种业务的短训班。有的还要举办讲座、夜党校、业余夜校（上海、云南、江苏），和到工厂、农村巡回讲课（云南）。
      哲学社会科学专业工作者
    到工农群众中去，到生产中去
    理论工作新气象的另一个方面，是专业的哲学社会科学专业工作者深入基层、深入生产现场，和工农群众密切结合的风气正在形成。5月中旬，中国科学院哲学社会科学部组织了所属各研究所的研究人员三百四十多人，由学部副主任潘梓年、刘导生率领，分别前往河北省的昌黎、静海、武清等地“下马观花”。当地的农业生产和农村各项工作的大跃进，农民群众和农村干部的革命干劲和首创精神，给哲学社会科学工作者很大的启发和鼓舞，大大推动了各研究所跃进计划的讨论。这种组织大批哲学社会科学工作者下马观花的方式，今后将经常采用。
    在工农学哲学的新气象面前，哲学工作者迫切要求深入农村工厂。许多单位已经组织许多哲学工作者分别到农村和工厂中去，和工农群众一同劳动，一同学习哲学，一同总结工作，一同编写切合工农群众迫切需要的哲学讲义。中国科学院哲学研究所的研究人员，已分别前往河南偃师、登封，河北徐水等地农村建立联系。这个所并和石景山钢铁厂等初步建立了协作关系。有的哲学工作者正在和一些工厂的党委书记合作，总结工作，研究问题，撰写哲学论文。中共中央直属高级党校哲学教研室主任艾思奇给天津市一百多个工厂的工人讲“怎样学习哲学”，副主任孙定国也分别在天津仁立毛织厂和国营天津第一棉纺织厂讲了哲学课。
    经济科学工作者也纷纷走出研究室，深入基层。经济学家姜君辰和国务院科学计划委员会的其他工作人员，最近先后参加了河北徐水县和山西雁北专区的总结工作的运动。中国科学院经济研究所的研究人员，最近参加了在广东新会举行的财贸工作现场会议。这个研究所认为，今后的研究工作，有很大一部分应当在县、区、农业社和工厂里进行，而不是在研究室进行。深入基层，深入现场，在当地党组织的指导下，就地分析情况，发现问题，收集材料，进行研究，能够更好地贯彻理论联系实际，科学研究为社会主义建设服务、为生产服务的方针，因此他们准备最近就组织较多的研究人员下厂下乡。
    高等学校的哲学社会科学系科，也正在拟定使全体教师和学生能够经常接触实际的办法。北京大学的哲学系决定全体师生下乡一年，一面参加生产劳动，一面进行调查研究，其他的系和其他的大学，也有类似的计划。
    在批判现代修正主义的斗争中，许多哲学社会科学的专业工作者，对南共纲领作了认真的分析批判，纷纷举行集会，驳斥这个彻头彻尾的现代修正主义纲领的反马克思主义的谬论。
