    Amazing Facts
    △New photographs of the sun have revealed a series of previously unknown scientific phenomena. For example, the whirlpools formed by solar gas can be as large as 1,100 kilometers in diameter!
    △The gas emitted by the sun's corona permeates the entire solar system. Radio waves can be reflected back to Earth from thousands of miles above, thanks to the power of these gases.
    △Pluto is about six billion kilometers away from the sun, which is forty times farther than the Earth is from the sun. If you were to travel there by a jet plane flying at 2,000 kilometers per hour, it would take 350 years.

    △新的太阳摄片，发现了一系列前所不知的科学现象。例如太阳气体所形成的涡卷之大，直径能达一千一百公里！
    △太阳光环发射的气体，迷漫整个太阳系，无线电波能从几千里的高空反射回地球，就是这些气体的力量。
    △冥王星距太阳大约六十亿公里，这要比地球离太阳遥远四十倍光景。如乘时速两千公里的喷气式飞机前往，需要飞行三百五十年之久。
