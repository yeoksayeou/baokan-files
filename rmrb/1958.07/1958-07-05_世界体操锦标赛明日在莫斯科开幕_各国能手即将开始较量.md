Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 4th: The World Gymnastics Championships, held every four years, will take place from July 6th to 10th at the Lenin Central Stadium in Moscow. This competition is particularly interesting because the strength and number of participants are unprecedented. Twenty-five gymnastics teams from twenty-four countries are participating, including Austria, Great Britain, Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany, Denmark, the United Arab Republic, Italy, China, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, the United States, Finland, France, West Germany, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, the Union of South Africa, and Japan. Among them, the Syrian region and the Egyptian region of the UAR each have a team participating.

The World Gymnastics Championships have a history of over fifty years. The first competition was held in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1903. The first world champion was the Frenchman, Mr. Martin. Initially, the competition was held every two years, but after World War I, it was changed to every four years. Before the tenth edition, only male athletes participated. It was not until the tenth edition in 1934 that women participated. The first female champion was Vlasta Děkanová of Czechoslovakia.

After the Second World War, the twelfth championship was held in Basel, Switzerland, in 1950. The women's champion was Rakoczy of Poland. The men's champion was Lehmann of Switzerland.

In previous competitions, France and Czechoslovakia have won the championship multiple times. Since Soviet gymnasts stepped onto the international gymnastics stage in 1952, the situation in international gymnastics competitions has undergone tremendous changes. Soviet athletes have consistently ranked among the top in various international competitions. At the 13th World Gymnastics Championships in 1954, the Soviet Union won the championship, taking thirty out of the thirty-four medals awarded.

What distinguishes this competition from previous ones is that it will be held for five days instead of four. The competition requires athletes to have great physical strength, endurance, a strong will, and higher skills. The team scores and the first place in the individual all-around will be determined during the first four days of the competition. On the fifth day, the individual world champions will be determined. The top six male and female athletes with the highest scores in each compulsory and optional exercise will participate in the individual championship on the fifth day.

A total of eighteen teams are participating in the men's team competition, and fourteen individuals from six countries are participating in the individual competition. A total of fourteen teams are participating in the women's team competition, and seven individuals from three countries are participating in the individual competition.

    世界体操锦标赛明日在莫斯科开幕
    各国能手即将开始较量
    据新华社莫斯科4日电　四年一度的世界体操锦标赛7月6日到10日将在莫斯科的列宁中央运动场举行。这次比赛之所以特别引人兴趣是由于参加者的实力之强和人数之多是历届所不及的。这次参加国家有奥地利、英国、比利时、保加利亚、匈牙利、民主德国、丹麦、阿拉伯联合共和国、意大利、中国、卢森堡、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联、美国、芬兰、法国、西德、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典、南非联邦和日本等二十四个国家的二十五个体操队。其中阿联的叙利亚地区和埃及地区各有一队参加。
    世界体操锦标赛已经有五十多年的历史。第一次比赛是1903年在比利时的安特卫普举行的。当时第一个世界冠军是法国人马丹。开始时每两年举行一次比赛，第一次世界大战后改成四年一次。在第十届以前，参加比赛的只是男子选手，直到1934年第十届开始才有女子参加。第一个女子冠军是捷克斯洛伐克的符拉斯塔·德卡诺娃。
    第二次大战后，1950年在瑞士的巴塞尔举行了第十二届锦标赛，女子冠军为波兰的拉科奇获得。男子是瑞士的列曼。
    在历届比赛中，法国和捷克斯洛伐克都多次获得冠军。从1952年苏联体操运动员登上国际体操舞台后，国际体操比赛中的形势，顿时起了巨大变化。苏联选手在历次国际比赛中都名列前茅。1954年第十三届世界体操锦标赛时苏联获得冠军，夺得了三十四枚奖章中的三十枚。
    本届比赛同以往不同的是，比赛将举行五天而不是四天。比赛要求运动员有很大的体力、耐久性、坚强的意志和更高的技巧。比赛进行头四天将确定团体成绩和个人全能第一名。第五天确定单项世界冠军。在规定动作和自选动作中，每项得分最多的前六名男女选手将参加第五天的单项冠军赛。
    参加本届比赛男子团体赛的共十八队，参加个人赛的共六个国家十四人。参加女子团体赛的共十四队，参加个人赛的共三个国家七人。
