Qingdao: Getting Rid of Cumbersome Manual Labor

According to Qingdao Daily, over 160 handicraft cooperative factories, societies, and groups in Qingdao, with more than 24,000 workers and members, have broken away from the old idea passed down through generations that handicraft means manual labor. They are engaging in a vigorous technical revolution, striving towards semi-mechanized and mechanized production through their own efforts.

From January to the first half of June this year, the city's handicraft industry proposed more than 2,000 rationalization proposals related to technical innovation. The Xinhua No. 1 Machine Factory had more than 20 significant technical innovations from June 1st to 18th alone. Before May, the factory's furnace workshop still relied on heavy manual forging. Now, after the workers designed and manufactured their own equipment, they have installed 18 large, medium, and small pneumatic hammers, freeing themselves from heavy physical labor and increasing production efficiency by an average of more than ten times.

Because the entire industry is carrying out technical innovation targeting weak links in production and conscientiously implementing the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, it has played a significant role in overcoming production difficulties and achieving the annual leap forward plan. The Taixi District Auto Welding Bicycle Repair Cooperative and the Taidong District Fourth Ironware Cooperative, due to the creation and improvement of machines, have greatly increased labor efficiency. Their June production leap forward plans were two and a half to three and a half times greater than in May.

To accelerate the transition of the handicraft industry to semi-mechanized and mechanized production, Party committees at all levels and the Municipal Handicraft Bureau and other leading departments are strengthening leadership in the technical revolution. The Municipal Handicraft Bureau has continuously held on-site meetings at units such as the Xinhua No. 1 Machine Factory and the Taidong District Woodware Cooperative, focusing on technical innovation around key production areas. This has played a significant role in promoting the technical innovation movement in handicraft units. Under the promotion of leading Party and government departments at higher levels, many handicraft units have established technical innovation research groups composed of workers and technicians. Now, the Municipal Handicraft Bureau and the Handicraft Union have proposed that all handicraft industries in the city, except for repair and service industries and arts and crafts industries that provide sporadic services to the masses, should achieve semi-mechanized and mechanized production within the year.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan - Yangcheng: Iron Cooperative Expanded into Steel Enterprise

The Yingchao Handicraft Iron Production Cooperative in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, is being expanded into a small-scale iron and steel joint enterprise – a cooperative factory. This cooperative factory will be developed into a small factory with major production equipment such as iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling, as well as other auxiliary equipment. It can produce 10,710 tons of pig iron, 10,000 tons of steel, and 5,300 tons of steel products annually. The expansion project began at the end of May, and the first newly built 6-cubic-meter blast furnace is being installed intensively and will soon be tested for production. The other four newly built blast furnaces and a steelmaking converter will also produce iron and steel before the end of July.

This year, the Yingchao Handicraft Iron Production Cooperative created a method of iron smelting in indigenous blast furnaces with little investment and high output through two major technical innovations. One is the use of anthracite coal (instead of coke) in indigenous blast furnaces for iron smelting, which provides experience for developing the iron smelting industry in areas where coke sources are difficult to obtain. The other is the successful experiment of using cold blast furnaces to smelt pig iron. Its investment is only one-quarter of the investment in hot blast furnaces with the same output, and a furnace with an annual output of 300 tons can be built in seven days. In the past two months, more than 10,000 factory and mine management cadres, engineering technicians, and workers from more than ten provinces and cities including Shandong, Sichuan, Shanghai, Anshan, and Henan, as well as from this province, have come to the Yingchao Cooperative to learn their indigenous iron smelting experience.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang - Yongxiu: Forging Iron Without Pulling Bellows

According to Jiangxi Daily, Liao Shenggen, a member of the Tubu Ironware Cooperative in Yongxiu County, Jiangxi Province, successfully created a "Powered Blower" on June 2nd. It not only replaces the hand-operated bellows but can also be used as a cooling device, thus greatly changing the production conditions for the members.

In ironware production, hand-operated bellows have been used for forging iron for a long time. This is both labor-intensive and tiring for the workers. To completely change the backward production methods of handicraft industry, Liao Shenggen, a member of this ironware cooperative, had long planned to imitate a "Powered Blower." After the Party issued the call for a technical revolution, it further encouraged his enthusiasm and drive to innovate tools. Therefore, he used all his spare time to start the trial production. The Party organization of the cooperative also specially selected more than ten members to assist him. When seamless steel pipes were lacking, he found clay pipes to replace them, overcoming various difficulties, and finally, on June 2nd, he made a ten-horsepower blower. Underground ventilation pipes were installed underground. As long as the original twelve-horsepower engine of the cooperative was used to drive it, the blower whirred, and a strong wind blew through the workshop, making people feel very cool during production. When the switch connecting the ventilation pipe to the ten forging furnaces was turned on, the wind blew into the furnace, and the iron inside quickly turned red. This not only reduced the manpower of more than ten hand-operated bellows but also reduced the temperature of the high-temperature iron casting workshop. At the same time, it also greatly increased the output of each furnace of molten iron, generally from the original 50 jin to about 150 jin, enabling ironware production to fundamentally break away from the outdated and backward state.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th - Shenyang: Handicraft Cooperative Makes Emery

The poor are ambitious, and small handicraft cooperatives create miracles. The Shenyang Construction Chemical Production Cooperative has produced a highly precise abrasive – 3000-grit corundum powder.

After appraisal by the Mineral Raw Material Research Institute of the Ministry of Geology, it was found that the particle error of this corundum powder is relatively small, which is rare in China.

Corundum powder and emery are both artificial abrasives, generally collectively referred to as emery in China. It is a precious and rare industrial raw material, second only to diamond in hardness. The emery and corundum powder with the largest specification number and the finest particles can be used to grind microscopes, telescopes, cameras, and other precision instruments. Coarse-grained ones can cut hard alloy steel, grind precision instruments made of various special steels, or be used as high-temperature refractory insulation materials. It is an important material that is urgently needed by China's industry. In the past, China produced very little, and those above 1000-grit relied entirely on foreign imports.

The Shenyang Construction Chemical Production Cooperative, which produced 3000-grit corundum powder, was organized by seven poor households that other cooperatives did not want.

In 1956, when the cooperative began producing corundum powder, the monthly output was only 30 kilograms, but in the second quarter of this year, the monthly output has leaped to 30,000 kilograms. The technical conditions and production scale have been improved and expanded compared to the past.

    机械操作结合必要的手工劳动
    用新技术来促进手工业
    青岛  摆脱笨重的手工劳动
    据青岛日报消息  青岛市一百六十多处手工业合作工厂和社、组，二万四千多名工人和社、组员，破除祖辈传留就是手工劳动的陈旧思想，大闹技术革命，靠自己的双手向半机械化、机械化生产迈进。
    该市手工业从今年1月份到6月上半月，共提出革新技术等方面的合理化建议两千多件，新华第一机械厂从6月1日到18日止，重大的技术革新就达二十多件。该厂的烘炉车间，在5月份以前还是笨重的手工锻造，现在经过职工自己绘图、自己制造，已安装了大中小型夹板电锤十八部，摆脱了笨重的体力劳动，使生产效率平均提高十倍以上。
    由于全行业针对生产中的薄弱环节进行技术革新，和认真贯彻了多快好省的方针，对克服生产困难，实现全年跃进计划起了很大作用。台西区汽焊脚踏车修配社和台东区第四铁器社，由于创造和改进了机器，劳动效率大大提高，6月份的生产跃进计划比5月份跃进两倍半到三倍半多。
    为加速手工业向半机械化、机械化生产迈进，各级党委和市手工业管理局等领导部门正加强技术革命的领导。市手工业管理局在新华第一机械厂、台东区木器社等单位连续召开了围绕生产关键开展技术革新的现场会议。这对促进手工业单位开展技术革新运动起了很大作用。在上级党政领导部门的促进下，许多手工业单位成立了由工人、技术人员组成的技术革新研究小组。现在市手工业管理局和手工业联社提出：全市手工业除了为群众零星服务的修配服务性和工艺美术品行业外，年内要全部实现半机械化和机械化生产。
    阳城  铁业社扩建为钢铁企业
    据新华社太原电  山西省阳城县应朝手工铁业生产合作社，正在扩建成为一个小型钢铁联合企业——合作工厂。这个合作工厂将发展成为具有炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等主要生产设备和其他辅助设备的小工厂，每年可以生产一万零七百一十吨生铁、一万吨钢和五千三百吨钢材。扩建工程从5月底开始，第一座新建的六立方公尺的高炉正在紧张安装，不久就要试炉生产。其他四座新建高炉和一座炼钢转炉，也在7月底以前出铁、出钢。
    应朝手工铁业生产合作社今年通过两项重大的技术革新，创造了投资少、产量高的土高炉炼铁方法。一项是利用土高炉用无烟煤炼铁（不用焦炭），为焦炭来源困难的地区发展炼铁工业提供了经验。一项是试验成功用冷风炉炼生铁，它的投资仅及同等产量的热风炉投资的四分之一，一个年产三百吨的炉子七天就可以建成。最近两个月来，山东、四川、上海、鞍山、河南等十多个省、市和本省的一万多个厂矿管理干部、工程技术人员和工人到应朝社学习了他们的土法炼铁经验。
    永修  锻铁不用手拉风箱了
    据江西日报消息：江西省永修县涂埠铁器社社员廖生根于6月2日创制“动力风鼓”成功。它不仅代替了手摇风箱，而且可以作降温设备，从此大大地改变了社员们的生产条件。
    在铁具生产中，长期以来都是用手拉风箱锻铁。这样既花人力，工人又很劳累。为了彻底改变手工业落后的生产方式，这个铁器社的社员廖生根很久以前就有仿制“动力风鼓”的打算，直到党发出技术革命的号召以后，更加鼓舞了他革新工具的热忱和劲头，因此，他利用着一切空暇的时间，开始了试制工作，社的党组织还特地抽了十多名社员给他做助手。当缺乏无缝钢管时，他便找瓦管代替，克服了各种各样的困难，终于6月2日制成了一部十马力的风鼓，地下安装上了地下通风管，只要利用该社原有的十二马力引擎一带动，风鼓呼呼转动，车间内顿时刮起大风，人们生产感到非常凉爽。再将通风管接通十座锻炉的开关一拨，风就往炉里吹，炉内的铁很快就锻红了。这样不仅减少了十多个手拉风箱的人力，且又给高温的铸铁车间降低了温度，同时还大大地提高了每炉铁水的产量，一般可由原五十斤提高到一百五十斤左右，使铁具生产从根本上摆脱了陈旧、落后的状态。
    沈阳  手工业社制成金钢砂
    据新华社沈阳9日电  人穷、志高，小手工业社创奇迹，沈阳建设化学生产合作社制成了精密度很高的磨料——三千号刚玉粉。
    地质部矿物原料研究所经过鉴定，认为这种刚玉粉的颗粒误差比较小，在国内是难得的。
    刚玉粉与金刚砂同是人造磨料，在我国一般统称为金刚砂。它是贵重、稀有的工业原料，硬度仅次于金刚钻。规格代号最大、颗粒最细的金刚砂和刚玉粉，可用作磨制显微镜、望远镜、照像机等各种精密器材；粗号的能切削硬质合金钢，研磨各种特殊钢制的精密仪器，或作高温耐火绝缘材料。它是我国工业十分需要的一种重要物资，过去我国生产很少，一千号以上的完全依靠国外进口。
    制造出三千号刚玉粉的沈阳建设化学生产合作社，是由七户其他合作社不愿要的穷户组织起来的。
    1956年，这个社开始生产刚玉粉时，每月产量只有三十公斤，而今年第二季度的月产量已跃进到三万公斤。技术条件和生产规模都比过去改进和扩大了。
