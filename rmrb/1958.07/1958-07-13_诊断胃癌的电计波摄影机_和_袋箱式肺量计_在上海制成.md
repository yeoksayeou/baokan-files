    “Electrograph Camera for Diagnosing Stomach Cancer” and “Bag-Box Spirometer” Made in Shanghai
    Many young doctors in Shanghai broke superstitions, dared to act, and created several new and important medical devices. One of them is an electrograph camera for diagnosing stomach cancer.
    This machine was successfully trial-produced by young doctors Zhang Kesui and Zhang Zongmu of the Department of Radiology of Zhongshan Hospital. The entire set of equipment used old materials and cost only 2 yuan and 3 jiao. This machine can trace the current of the human internal organs into a curve, which is of great help in diagnosing early stomach cancer. After testing, the wave shadows of the heartbeat and gastric peristalsis traced by it are very clear.
    Another new instrument can measure thirteen kinds of respiratory functions.
    It is rare in the world for one instrument to measure thirteen respiratory function items. This instrument can also draw corresponding respiratory curve recordings, which can observe respiratory changes in each period. It is of great significance for thoracic surgery, industrial and mining enterprises, and other departments to measure workers' lung function and labor capacity. This instrument is called the "Bag-Box Spirometer" and was created by Gu Jukang, a young demobilized soldier with only junior high school education from the Shanghai Occupational Disease Prevention and Control Institute. When he was transferred from the army to the Occupational Disease Prevention and Control Institute last August, he didn't even understand the three words "lung function."

    “诊断胃癌的电计波摄影机”和“袋箱式肺量计”在上海制成
    上海许多青年医生破除迷信，敢作敢为，创造了好几件新型的重要医疗器具。其中之一是诊断胃癌的电计波摄影机。
    这架机器是由中山医院放射科青年医师张克随、章宗穆等人试制成功的。全套器材设备都是利用的旧材料，只花了二元三角钱。这架机器能把人体内脏的电流描记成曲线，对诊断早期胃癌有很大的帮助。经过试验，用它描记的心跳和胃蠕动的波影都很清晰。
    另一种是可以测定十三种呼吸机能的新仪器。
    一件仪器可以测定十三种呼吸机能项目在世界上是少见的。这架仪器也能画出相应的呼吸曲线描记，可以观察每段时间内呼吸变化情况。它对于胸外科手术、工矿企业等部门测定工人肺功能和劳动力情况有很大作用。这架仪器叫“袋箱式肺量计”，是上海市职业病防治所一个只有初中文化程度的青年转业军人顾菊康创造的。他去年8月从部队转业到职业病防治所的时候，对“肺功能”三个字也弄不懂。
