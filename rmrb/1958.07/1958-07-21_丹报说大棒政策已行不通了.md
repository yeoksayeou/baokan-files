    The Danish Radical Party's "Politiken" believes that the current situation in the Middle East reflects the crisis of the West's entire position in the Middle East and the strength of the Arab national movement. In this situation, resorting to military suppression in the Middle East as before will only lead to the opposite result.
      "Izvestia" editorial points out that the time when the West wanted to "change the general direction of the Arab world has passed," as evidenced by the Suez incident.

    丹报说大棒政策已行不通了
    丹麦激进党“政治报”认为目前中东的局势反映了西方在中东整个地位的危机和阿拉伯民族运动力量的强大。在这种情况下，再像从前那样对中东采取武力镇压政策，就只会导致相反的结果。
      “消息报”的社论指出，西方想“转变阿拉伯世界的总方向的时候已经过去了”，苏伊士事件就是明证。
