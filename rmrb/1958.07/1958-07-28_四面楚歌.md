    Besieged on All Sides
    Liu Feng
    It's a very simple truth that unjust aggressor armies are unwelcome everywhere, and even war-mongers driven mad by profit can't fail to understand this. But when they are cornered like dogs jumping over a wall, they care about nothing.
    The moment the Anglo-American invaders stepped into Lebanon and Jordan, a chorus of strong resistance rang out from all directions around them, with bullets and explosives awaiting them. This worldwide voice of popular resistance is growing stronger and stronger. In our country, 64 million people held massive demonstrations firmly supporting the people of the Middle East in opposing the Anglo-American aggression. In Calcutta, India, 150,000 students went on strike to protest the Anglo-American armed intervention in the Middle East. Dockworkers in Morocco held demonstrations refusing to unload American munitions ships... The cries of "strike them down" have even forced the American monopoly capitalists' "Wall Street Journal" to admit that Anglo-American troops are not welcome anywhere. As a Lebanese engineer educated in the United States said, "This is my country. I don't want armed Americans occupying it." This is not just one person's voice, but the voice of the entire Lebanon, the voice of the people of every country occupied by the United States.
    The invaders are now even more deeply mired in the mud, besieged on all sides and finding it difficult to move forward. They have already suffered a complete political defeat.

    四面楚歌
    刘丰
    非正义的侵略军到处都是不受欢迎的，这是一个极简单的道理，即使是利令智昏的战争贩子也不会不懂得。可是当他们狗急跳墙的时候，就什么也顾不得了。
    美英侵略者刚刚一踏进黎巴嫩、约旦，就从他们的左右前后四面八方响起了一片强烈的反抗的声音，等着他们的是枪弹和爆炸物。这种全世界人民反抗的呼声越来越强烈，在我国就有六千四百万人举行了坚决支持中东人民反对美英侵略的大示威，印度加尔各答十五万学生罢课抗议美英武装干涉中东，摩洛哥码头工人举行示威不给美国军火船卸货……。一片喊打之声使美国垄断资本家们的“华尔街日报”也不得不承认到处都不欢迎美英军队。一个在美国受教育的黎巴嫩工程师说得好：“这是我的国家。我不希望武装的美国人占领它。”这不只是一个人的声音，而是整个黎巴嫩的声音，是每一个被美国占领的国家人民的声音。
    侵略者如今更陷入了深深的泥沼，四面楚歌举步维艰，在政治上已经遭到彻底的失败了。
