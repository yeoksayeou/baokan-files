The "Converter" vs. "Electric Furnace" Dispute
By our reporter Meng Fan

The "Converter" vs. "Electric Furnace" dispute that unfolded between workers and technical personnel at the Tianjin New Rising Steel Plant is very educational. The workers advocated for, and actually used, converters to produce welding rod steel and silicon steel. Some technical personnel disagreed, believing that only electric furnaces could produce good steel. This is a difference between two kinds of thinking: bold innovation versus blind faith in established rules; it is also a divergence on the two construction lines: more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive.

This debate began in late April when producing welding rod steel. According to convention, the technical personnel advocated that producing welding rod steel required first melting pig iron into molten iron, then refining the molten iron into molten steel in a converter, and finally putting the molten steel into an electric furnace to produce the finished product. Young worker Sun Jinqi felt this was too cumbersome and did not conform to the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical. With the support of the factory director and the Party General Branch Secretary, he and the workers researched a new set of operating methods, directly using the converter to produce welding rod steel, shortening the smelting time by 75%. In this way, the factory's annual output of welding rod steel could increase from 7,000 tons to 30,000 tons, and the cost could be reduced by 26%.

While all the factory's employees were celebrating this innovation, Deputy Factory Director and Engineer Chen Fenggao believed that the theory in books was important and should not be easily changed. Books stipulated that welding rod steel had to be refined in an electric furnace, which took more than two hours. Now, using a converter only took a dozen minutes, so the quality must be problematic. The factory director respected Chen Fenggao's opinion and had the welding rod steel produced by the converter tested in many ways, proving that the quality was excellent. However, Chen Fenggao insisted on his own view, believing that welding rod steel refined by the converter was different from welding rod steel refined by the electric furnace. When a welding rod manufacturing factory in Tianjin sent people to the New Rising Steel Plant to place an order, he insisted that the steel refined by the converter was unqualified and could not leave the factory. The factory leadership did not adopt his opinion.

In late May, technicians and veteran workers who had been sent by the factory to the Taiyuan Steel Plant to learn the technology of refining silicon steel with electric furnaces returned to the factory. At this time, the factory's electric furnace was under repair and could not be used for a while. Veteran worker Tian Zhenxiang felt that the country urgently needed silicon steel sheets, and the sooner production started, the better, so he proposed using a converter to refine silicon steel. However, Sun Shaozeng, the technician who had studied with him at the Taiyuan Steel Plant, believed that refining silicon steel definitely required an electric furnace, and a large casting steel equipment had to be manufactured, and the steel had to be rolled in Taiyuan after it was refined. Engineer Chen Fenggao also had the same opinion, saying, "Throughout history, no one has ever used a converter to refine silicon steel." However, the factory director and the General Branch Secretary supported the workers' opinions and once again broke through superstition, using the converter to refine high-quality silicon steel.

As a result, the technical personnel’s "authority" was violated. Engineer Chen Fenggao had studied in the United States, and he had done some work from the construction of the New Rising Steel Plant to the production of steel, becoming an "authority." In the past, whenever something was encountered, if he believed it was "not in accordance with theoretical basis," it could not be done. Technician Sun Shaozeng was a young man who had just graduated from school. He had some theoretical knowledge and did not value the practical experience of the workers. After the factory leaders supported the workers in successively refining welding rod steel and silicon steel with converters, Sun Shaozeng was the first to put up a big-character poster to oppose it. He said, "The leadership's guiding principles in production are wrong" and "opportunistic." Chen Fenggao also said that the leading cadres had "capitalist business ideas," his reason being that the leadership encouraged the use of converters to refine high-quality steel, "greedily" seeking low costs and disregarding quality. However, the employees disagreed with their remarks and posted many big-character posters for debate. The Party General Branch Committee of the factory believed that the "Converter" vs. "Electric Furnace" dispute was a matter of principle concerning the construction line and it was necessary to distinguish right from wrong. Therefore, the leadership convened a forum and organized the employees to launch a great debate.

The central issue of this debate was: what attitude and method should be used to implement the general line of socialist construction. Chen Fenggao and Sun Shaozeng believed that using converters to refine high-quality steel was not orthodox and showed capitalist business ideas; the workers criticized this erroneous view. They said: The factory, based on the needs of national construction and breaking conventions, was precisely a concrete manifestation of correctly implementing the general line, in line with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. In the debate, although individual engineers eloquently emphasized theoretical basis, the actual basis had powerfully refuted the rigid theory.

### “转”“电”之争

    “转”“电”之争
    本报记者　孟帆
    天津新兴钢厂职工和技术人员之间展开的“转电之争”，很有教育意义。工人们主张并且实际用转炉炼出了电焊条钢和矽钢；有些技术人员不赞成，认为只有用电炉才能炼出好钢。这是大胆创造或是迷信成规两种思想的分歧，也是多快好省或者少慢差费两条建设路线上的分歧。
    这场争辩是在4月下旬炼电焊条钢时开始的。技术人员按照常规，主张炼电焊条钢需要先把生铁熔成铁水，再把铁水放在转炉中炼成钢水，然后把钢水放入电炉才能出成品。青年工人孙金琦觉得这太费事，不符合多快好省的精神。他在厂长、党总支书记的支持下，和工人们研究了一套新的操作方法，直接用转炉炼出了电焊条钢，熔炼时间缩短了75％。这样，工厂电焊条钢的年产量可以由七千吨增加到三万吨，成本还能降低26％。
    在全厂职工祝贺这个创举的时候，副厂长、工程师陈凤皋认为：书本上的理论是重要的，不能轻易改变。书本上规定电焊条钢要用电炉炼，必须用两个多小时。现在用转炉只十几分钟，质量一定有问题。厂长尊重陈凤皋的意见，把用转炉炼成的电焊条钢，从多方面进行了化验，证明质量优良。但是，陈凤皋坚持自己的看法，认为转炉炼的电焊条钢和电炉炼的电焊条钢不一样。当天津一个制造电焊条的工厂派人到新兴钢厂订货的时候，他强调用转炉炼的钢不合格，不能出厂。工厂领导方面没有采纳他的意见。
    5月下旬，工厂派往太原钢厂学习用电炉炼矽钢的技术员、老工人回到了工厂。这时，工厂的电炉正在修理，一时不能使用。老工人田祯祥觉得国家急需矽钢片，越早生产越好，就提出用转炉炼矽钢的意见。可是和他一起到太原钢厂学习的技术员孙绍曾认为，炼矽钢一定得用电炉，而且要制造一套大型铸钢设备，炼出钢后还要到太原去轧制。陈凤皋工程师也有同样的意见，说：“古今中外还没有用转炉炼矽钢的。”但是，厂长和总支书记支持了工人的意见，再一次冲破了迷信，用转炉炼出了质量优良的矽钢。
    这一来，技术人员的“权威”被侵犯了。陈凤皋工程师曾留学美国，新兴钢厂从建成到出钢，他都做过一些工作，成为“权威”，过去碰到什么事情，只要他认为“不合理论根据”就不能做。技术员孙绍曾是刚出校门不久的青年，有一些理论知识，不重视工人的实际经验。在工厂领导干部支持工人用转炉先后炼成电焊条钢和矽钢以后，孙绍曾首先贴出大字报反对。他说：“领导在指导生产中的方针有错误”，“投机取巧。”陈凤皋也说领导干部有“资本主义经营思想”，他的理由是领导方面鼓励用转炉炼优质钢，“贪图”成本低，不顾质量。可是，职工不同意他们的言论，贴了许多大字报辩论。工厂的党总支委员会认为：“转电之争”是有关建设路线上的原则分歧，必须分清是非。于是，领导方面召开座谈会，组织职工展开了大辩论。
    这场辩论的中心问题是：用哪一种态度和方法贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线。陈凤皋、孙绍曾认为用转炉炼优质钢不正规，是有资本主义经营思想；工人们批判了这种错误意见。他们说：工厂根据国家建设需要，打破常规，恰是正确执行总路线的具体表现，符合多快好省的方针。在辩论中，尽管个别工程师滔滔不绝地强调理论根据，而实际根据已经有力地驳倒了死板的理论。
