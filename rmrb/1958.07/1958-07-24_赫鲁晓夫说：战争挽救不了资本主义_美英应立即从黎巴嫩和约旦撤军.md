Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd dispatch from Moscow: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev pointed out at a banquet held by the Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union on the evening of the 22nd that the Soviet Union is willing to do everything possible to help colonial peoples achieve liberation and national independence. Imperialism's attempt to stop the national movement in the Arab world will not succeed. The Soviet Union will do everything possible to consolidate the Republic of Iraq.

Khrushchev made the remarks after Ambassador Gajda's speech, saying that now, like a surging spring flood breaking through years of unmelting ice, colonial rule is being constantly shattered in a series of countries. People are throwing off and breaking the shackles of colonialism. We salute the colonial people's movement against oppressors, and we are willing to do everything possible to help them achieve their rational and lofty goals.

Khrushchev said that our era is undergoing tremendous changes, and many people did not expect the Baghdad Pact to collapse so quickly. Not long ago, Baghdad was a fortress of the imperialist camp, but on July 14th, the same Baghdad became an opponent of the imperialist countries. Therefore, imperialism wants to strangle the Republic of Iraq and stop the national movement in the Arab world. However, imperialism's attempt to stop the national movement in the Arab world will not succeed.

Khrushchev said that we express our respect to the government of the Republic of Iraq, to Prime Minister Qassem's courage, determination, and loyalty to the people.

Khrushchev then said that we hope for world peace, we do not need war. The imperialists intend to resort to the last resort—war; but even this last resort cannot save the capitalist system.

Referring to the recent visit of President Nasser of the United Arab Republic to the Soviet Union, Khrushchev said that Nasser does not agree with our political views. However, when we exchanged views on the situation in the Middle East, we understood each other. We discussed how to stop the imperialists and how to prevent them from launching a war. We will do everything possible to prevent a war from breaking out in the Middle East. We will do everything possible to consolidate the newly born Republic of Iraq. What kind of social structure this republic will establish is a matter for their own people. The Soviet Union only hopes for one thing: that the Republic of Iraq becomes an independent country, that it consolidates and develops its own economy, and that it prospers.

Khrushchev expressed the hope that the leaders of the United States and Britain would show wisdom and understand the changed world situation and the spirit of the times, and withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

    赫鲁晓夫说：战争挽救不了资本主义
    美英应立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫22日晚在波兰驻苏联大使举行的宴会上指出，苏联愿意尽一切可能帮助殖民地人民获得解放和民族独立。帝国主义想阻止阿拉伯世界的民族运动是办不到的。苏联将尽一切可能使伊拉克共和国得以巩固。
    赫鲁晓夫是在盖德大使致词以后讲话的，他说，现在，像汹涌的春洪冲破经年不化的冰层一样，在一系列的国家内殖民统治正在不断被粉碎。人民正在摆脱和挣断殖民主义的枷锁。我们向起来反对压迫者的殖民地人民运动致敬，我们愿意尽一切可能来帮助他们达到合理而崇高的目的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们的时代正在发生巨大的变化，很多人都没有想到巴格达条约这样快就要垮台。不久以前，巴格达还是帝国主义阵营的堡垒，但是到了7月14日，同一个巴格达就成了帝国主义国家的对头，因此帝国主义想要扼杀伊拉克共和国和阻止阿拉伯世界的民族运动。但是，帝国主义想阻止阿拉伯世界的民族运动是办不到的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们对伊拉克共和国政府、对卡塞姆总理的勇敢、坚决及其对人民的忠诚表示敬意。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们希望世界和平，我们不需要战争。帝国主义者打算求助于最后手段——战争；但是，就是这最后手段也拯救不了资本主义制度。
    在谈到阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔最近对苏联的访问时，赫鲁晓夫说，纳赛尔不同意我们的政治观点。但是，当我们就中近东的局势交换意见的时候，我们是互相谅解的。我们讨论了如何制止帝国主义者，如何阻止它们发动战争。我们将尽一切努力使中近东不爆发战争。我们将尽一切可能使最近诞生的伊拉克共和国得以巩固。这个共和国将建立怎样的社会结构，这是他们人民自己的事情。苏联只希望一点：希望伊拉克共和国成为一个独立的国家，希望它巩固和发展本国的经济，希望它繁荣昌盛。
    赫鲁晓夫表示希望美国和英国领导人表现出明智态度和了解已经变化了的世界局势及时代精神，把他们的军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
