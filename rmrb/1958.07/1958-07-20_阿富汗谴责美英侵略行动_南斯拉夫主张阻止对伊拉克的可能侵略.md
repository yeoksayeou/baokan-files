Xinhua News Agency, July 19th – According to a Reuters report today, a spokesman for the Afghan Embassy in India announced in New Delhi today that the Afghan Foreign Ministry has issued a communique condemning the armed intervention by the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan.

The Afghan cabinet held a meeting on the 17th and decided to support the proposal to convene a United Nations General Assembly meeting to discuss the Middle East issue.

The spokesman also said that the claim circulating in Tehran that Soviet troops had entered Afghanistan was "completely false."

Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, July 18th – The Yugoslav government issued a statement today, believing that the landing of British troops in Jordan has further exacerbated the already explosive situation in the Middle East. The statement pointed out that it is particularly dangerous that the King of Jordan's implied attempt to declare himself the head of the disintegrated Arab Federation is aimed at legitimizing possible aggression against the legitimate and independent government of the Republic of Iraq.

The Yugoslav government advocates that the United Nations take swift and appropriate effective action to prevent the armed intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Jordan from escalating into aggression against Iraq.

    阿富汗谴责美英侵略行动
    南斯拉夫主张阻止对伊拉克的可能侵略
    据新华社19日讯　据路透社今天报道，阿富汗驻印度大使馆的一位发言人今天在新德里宣布，阿富汗外交部发表了一项公报，谴责美英两国武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的行动。
    阿富汗内阁在17日举行了会议，决定支持关于召开联合国大会会议讨论中东问题的建议。
    这位发言人还说，在德黑兰流传的关于苏联军队已经进入阿富汗的说法“完全是谎言”。
    据新华社贝尔格莱德18日电南斯拉夫政府今天发表声明，认为英国军队在约旦的登陆进一步加剧了已经带有爆炸性的中东形势。声明指出，特别危险的是，约旦国王所暗示的企图宣布自己为解体了的阿拉伯联邦的首脑，其目的在于使对合法的和独立的伊拉克共和国政府可能进行的侵略变得合法化。
    南斯拉夫政府主张联合国迅速采取适当的有效行动，以阻止对黎巴嫩和约旦这两个国家的内政的武装干涉扩大成为对伊拉克的侵略。
