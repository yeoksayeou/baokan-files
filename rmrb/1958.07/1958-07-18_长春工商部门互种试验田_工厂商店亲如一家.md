Changchun, July 17 (Our Reporter Li Shugong) – Based on heightened ideological awareness during the rectification movement, the Jiami Can Factory in Changchun and the Changchun Department Store have brought their collaboration to a higher level by cross-planting "experimental fields." This collaborative "experimental field" also enables both parties to better meet the needs of the people.

These two units began cross-planting "experimental fields" in April. Their approach is as follows: leading cadres, workshop directors, and workers from the factory participate in sales at the department store, meet directly with sales staff and consumers, and listen to opinions on the factory's products; leading cadres, buyers, and sales staff from the department store participate in production at the factory, familiarize themselves with the production process and product knowledge, participate in the trial production of new products, and understand and help the factory solve difficulties in raw material supply and product sales.

When cadres and workers from the Jiami Can Factory participated in sales at the department store, they learned about market conditions they had not known before and heard consumers' opinions on the factory's products. In the past, workers at this factory believed their products were similar to those from Shanghai and other places, so they did not heed suggestions for improving product quality. When they participated in sales, customers raised many objections to their products. Some complained that the designs were limited and the styles were poor, while others said they were not as shiny or user-friendly as goods from Shanghai. When some workers were about to explain, customers produced actual products for comparison, demonstrating that their products indeed had shortcomings. As a result, the employees realized that the store is the best appraisal institute for products, and customers are the best appraisers. They must constantly listen to and study consumers' opinions according to market needs in order to improve product quality. After returning to the factory, they immediately proposed the goal of diversifying products, increasing oxidized products, and surpassing Tianjin and catching up with Shanghai in quality within a year. Currently, a new atmosphere of everyone studying technology and everyone caring about improving product quality has formed. The number of products has increased from seven to sixteen. The milk pot, which had not been successfully trial-produced in the past two years, was now successfully trial-produced in seven days.

After the department store staff participated in production at the factory, they learned many skills and improved their professional knowledge, thereby greatly improving the quality of sales. When they learned about the difficulties the factory was facing, they actively helped to solve them. They discovered that the factory was about to run out of raw materials for alumina products, and they could not be purchased on the market. They quickly contacted various commercial systems to supply a batch, ensuring the factory's need to increase oxidized products. To support the factory in trial-producing new products, the store also collected seventeen samples from Shanghai, Tianjin, and imports for the factory's reference. As the factory's production expanded, the store's supply of goods also increased, and the department store's purchase plan from this factory this year exceeded the original plan by eleven times.

The method of cross-planting "experimental fields" has enhanced the overall perspective and the spirit of "one for all, all for one" among the personnel of both parties. Before the cross-planting of "experimental fields," both parties often only calculated small accounts and not large accounts, bickering and complaining with each other. Now there has been a major change. Aluminum products that are damaged or discolored during transportation and storage in the store can be returned to the factory for repair at any time; the store also sells all defective products from the factory at a price based on quality.

Currently, the experience of industry and commerce cross-planting "experimental fields" is being widely promoted in many factories and stores in Changchun. (Attached picture)

### 长春工商部门互种试验田  工厂商店亲如一家

    长春工商部门互种试验田
    工厂商店亲如一家
    本报长春17日电　记者李树功报道：长春市嘉美制罐厂和长春百货公司在整风运动提高了思想觉悟的基础上，通过互种“试验田”，使双方协作关系进入了更高的阶段。这种协作“试验田”还使双方能够更好地满足人民需要。
    这两个单位从4月份开始互种“试验田”。他们的作法是：工厂的领导干部、车间主任和工人到商店参加营业，同营业员和广大消费者直接见面，听取对本厂产品的意见；商店的领导干部和采购员、营业员到工厂参加生产，熟悉生产过程和产品知识，参与新产品试制工作，并且了解和帮助工厂解决在原料供应和产品推销方面的困难。
    嘉美制罐厂的干部和工人到商店参加营业，了解到许多他们过去不知道的市场情况，和消费者对本厂产品的意见。这个厂的工人过去认为他们的产品和上海等地差不多，因此对改进产品质量的意见听不进去。他们参加营业时，顾客对他们的产品提出了许多意见。有的嫌花样少，样式不好，有的说不如上海货光亮、好使等。有的工人听了以后正要解释，顾客却拿出实物当场作了比较，证明他们的产品确实存在缺点。职工们因此认识到：商店是产品最好的鉴定所，顾客是产品最好的鉴定人，必须不断地根据市场需要听取和研究消费者的意见，以改进产品质量。他们回厂后立即提出了产品要多样化，增加氧化产品，在质量上一年超过天津、赶上上海的奋斗目标。目前一个人人钻研技术，人人关心改进产品质量的新风气已经形成。产品已由七种增加到十六种。过去两年没有试制成功的牛奶锅，现在七天就试制成功了。
    商店人员到工厂参加生产以后，学到了许多本领，提高了业务知识，从而大大提高了营业质量。他们了解到工厂存在的困难，就积极帮助解决。他们发现工厂氧化铝制品的原料即将用完，市场上又买不到，便通过商业系统多方联系，迅速供应给一批，保证了工厂增加氧化产品的需要。为了支持工厂试制新产品，商店还收集了上海、天津及进口的十七种样品，供工厂参考。工厂生产发展以后，商店货源扩大了，百货公司今年向这个厂的进货计划超过原计划十一倍。
    互种“试验田”的办法，使双方人员增强了全局观点和“我为人人，人人为我”的精神。在互种“试验田”以前，双方往往只算小账，不算大账，互相扯皮、埋怨。现在来了个大转变。商店在运输保管过程中出现了残损和变色的铝制品，可以随时送回工厂修理；工厂出的次品，商店也按质论价一律包销。
    目前，工商互种“试验田”的经验，正在长春市不少工厂、商店中普遍推广。（附图片）
