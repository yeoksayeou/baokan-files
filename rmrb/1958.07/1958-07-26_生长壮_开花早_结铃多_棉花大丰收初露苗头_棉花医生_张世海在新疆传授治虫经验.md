	Growing Strong, Blooming Early, More Bolls
	Cotton Bumper Harvest Shows Initial Signs
	"Cotton Doctor" Zhang Shihai Transmits Insect Control Experience in Xinjiang
	(Our Report) After continuous strengthening of management in various regions, cotton is growing more vigorously, with most cotton plants already blooming and forming bolls. Initial signs of a bumper cotton harvest are emerging. In major cotton-producing areas of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Shaanxi provinces, cotton growth is generally more uniform and robust than last year. In Chaoyang County, Liaoning Province, cotton growth has reached a level unseen in many years, with blooming and boll formation occurring twenty days earlier than last year. In Sichuan Province, most cotton fields have more than ten fruit branches per plant, with each plant generally bearing five bolls. Some cotton fields were previously affected by wind frost and poor management, but after a general survey and strengthened management, significant improvements have been made. Inspections in Hubei, Jiangsu, Shandong, and other provinces show that first-class and second-class seedlings account for over 80%-90% of the total cotton field area. In Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, third-class seedlings have been basically eliminated. In Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, first-class cotton fields account for 72.6%, second-class cotton fields account for 24.7%, and poor cotton fields account for only 2.7%. First-class cotton plants have an average of more than ten fruit branches, about twenty-five flower buds, and more than three or four blossoms. Second-class cotton seedlings have more than eight fruit branches and about twenty buds. Third-class cotton seedlings generally have more than five fruit branches.
	After the wheat harvest, various regions have further strengthened cotton field management, calling for further strengthening of topdressing, intertillage, pest control, drought resistance, drainage, and pruning. A new upsurge in cotton leap-forward production has begun.
	(Our Report) Zhang Shihai, an ordinary soldier of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, has been diligently researching and experimenting in the prevention and control of cotton diseases and insect pests for more than six years. He is now familiar with the habits and activities of more than twenty kinds of pests and has developed many "local methods" for prevention and control. The various cotton-growing farms of the Production Corps have achieved great results by promoting his methods. Recently, he participated in the Autonomous Region's agricultural technology reporting group, composed of experts, professors, and labor models, to teach knowledge and experience in the prevention and control of cotton diseases and insect pests to various places. He has been widely praised by people of all ethnic groups and is known as the "Cotton Doctor."
	From an ordinary soldier to a cotton doctor is the result of Zhang Shihai's more than six years of hard work. In 1952, when he first took on cotton plant protection work, he knew nothing about plant protection. He studied culture and read books on pest control while going deep into the fields to observe insect activities. After a long period of careful observation and research, he became very familiar with the life cycle of cotton aphids, cotton bollworms, and other twenty kinds of pests. He mastered the laws of their metamorphosis, damage period, and spawning and lurking areas, and thus found effective control methods. For example, he observed that cotton bollworms breed three generations a year. If they are not eliminated in time, one cotton bollworm and its offspring will destroy more than a thousand cotton bolls a year, which is equivalent to eating more than nine jin of cotton. According to the spawning and larval characteristics of the cotton bollworm, he used "DDT" and "666" to hunt and kill them in stages, so that they were eliminated before they seriously harmed crops.
	Due to his hard work, Zhang Shihai has created many effective "local methods" for controlling cotton pests. In the past, books and experts on pest control all said to use raw tobacco water. But he experimented with using boiled tobacco water to kill aphids, and the insecticidal rate reached 98%. Zhang Shihai also made many kinds of multi-effect mixed agents based on his own experiments. He mixed "wettable 666 powder," "superphosphate," and "lime sulfur mixture," which originally could only treat one kind of pest, in a certain proportion for use. One spray can simultaneously cure cotton bollworm and cotton aphids, and also perform foliar fertilization on cotton.
	Zhang Shihai is very familiar with the overwintering, spawning, and parasitic locations of various pests. He is now studying how to eliminate insect eggs in order to eradicate their offspring.

    生长壮　开花早　结铃多
    棉花大丰收初露苗头
    “棉花医生”张世海在新疆传授治虫经验
    本报讯　各地棉花经过不断地加强管理，生长更加旺盛，大部棉花已经开花结铃，棉花大丰收已经初露苗头。河北、河南、山东、山西、江苏、湖北、陕西等省主要产棉区，棉花生长普遍比去年整齐健壮，辽宁省朝阳县棉花生长也出现多年未见的景象，开花结铃比去年早二十天；四川省大部棉田已有十个果枝以上，一般已每株结铃五个。部分棉田早期曾受风冻和管理不好等影响，经过普查和加强管理，也已大为转变。湖北、江苏、山东等省检查，一类苗和二类苗的棉田占总棉田面积的80％—90％以上。江苏省泗阳县三类苗已基本消灭，河北省邯郸专区，一类棉田占72.6％，二类棉田占24.7％，差的棉田只占2.7％。一类棉田的棉花，平均每株有果枝十个以上，花蕾二十五个左右，开花三、四个以上；二类棉苗有果枝八个以上，着蕾二十个左右；三类棉苗一般也有果枝五个以上。
    各地在麦收后，更进一步地加强了棉田管理，要求进一步加强追肥、中耕、治虫、抗旱排涝和整枝等工作。棉花跃进增产又掀起了新的高潮。
    本报讯　新疆生产设建兵团一个普通战士——张世海，在防治棉花病虫害方面进行了六年多的刻苦钻研和实验，已经熟悉二十多种害虫的习性和活动，并研究出许多防治的“土办法”。生产兵团各植棉农场由于推广他的方法获得很大成效。最近他参加了由专家、教授和劳动能手组成的自治区农业技术报告团，到各地传授防治棉花病虫害的知识和经验，受到各族人民的普遍赞扬，被人们誉为“棉花医生”。
    从普通战士到棉花医生，是张世海六年多刻苦钻研的结果。1952年他刚刚担任棉花植保工作时，植保知识一点不懂。他便一面学习文化，阅读有关防治虫害书籍；一面深入到田间观察害虫活动。经过长期的细心体察和研究，他对棉蚜虫、棉铃虫等二十多种害虫的生活规律非常熟悉，掌握了害虫的变胎期、危害期以及产卵潜伏地区的规律，因而找到了有效的防治办法。例如，他经过观察，发现棉铃虫每年要繁殖三代，如果不及时消灭，一个棉铃虫和它的后代一年就要毁掉一千多个棉桃，等于吃掉九斤多棉花。他根据棉铃虫的产卵和幼虫的特性，用“滴滴涕”和“六六六”分期捕杀，使它在严重危害作物之前就被消灭。
    张世海由于刻苦钻研，在防治棉花虫害方面创造了很多有效的“土办法”。过去，在有关防治病虫害书籍和专家们讲的都是说用生烟水。但是他试验用熬过的烟草水杀蚜虫，杀虫率达到98％。张世海还根据自己的实验，制成很多种多效用的混合药剂。他把原来只能治一种害虫的“可湿性六六六粉”、“过磷酸钙”和“石灰硫磺合剂”，按一定比例混在一起使用，一次喷射兼治棉铃虫和棉蚜虫，同时还给棉花作了根外追肥。
    张世海对各种害虫的越冬产卵和寄生地点非常熟悉，他现在正在研究消灭虫卵，以根绝其后代。
