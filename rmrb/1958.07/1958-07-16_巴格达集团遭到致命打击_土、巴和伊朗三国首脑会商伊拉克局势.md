Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: Ankara dispatch: The heads of state of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan hastily held a conference in the Turkish capital of Ankara on the 14th to discuss the profound impact of the sudden coup in Iraq on the situation in the Middle East and the Baghdad Pact.

The coup in Iraq, which occurred at dawn on the 14th, disrupted the summit meeting of the four Muslim member states of the Baghdad Pact, which was scheduled to be held in Istanbul on the 15th. This meeting was originally intended to discuss the issue of intervention in the Lebanese situation.

The tripartite meeting was held in a tense and constrained atmosphere. According to reports, the talks continued late into the night, and they discussed the issue of selecting a new headquarters location for the Baghdad Pact organization. The presidential palace, where the talks were held, was heavily guarded, preventing reporters from approaching.

News from Ankara and Tehran indicates that Turkish and Iranian officials were both "shocked" by the coup in Iraq. They acknowledged that the coup was a "fatal blow" to the Baghdad Pact. Iranian officials said that "all plans" for the Baghdad Pact "must be revised."

    新华社15日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦三国首脑14日在土耳其首都安卡拉匆忙举行会商，讨论突然发生的伊拉克政变对中东局势和巴格达条约所起的巨大影响。
    14日黎明发生的伊拉克政变打乱了这四个巴格达条约穆斯林成员国预定15日在伊斯坦布尔举行首脑会议的计划。这个会议原定要讨论干涉黎巴嫩局势的问题。
    这个三国会议是在紧张而侷促的气氛中举行的。据报道，会谈一直进行到深夜，他们讨论了挑选一个新的巴格达条约组织总部所在地的问题。会谈地址的总统府周围警卫森严，不让记者们接近。
    来自安卡拉和德黑兰的消息显示，土耳其和伊朗官方都对伊拉克政变感到“震惊”。它们承认，这个政变是对巴格达条约的一个“致命打击”。伊朗官员说，巴格达条约的“所有计划都必须修改”。
