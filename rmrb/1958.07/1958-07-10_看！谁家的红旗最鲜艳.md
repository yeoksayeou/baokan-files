Sucking Sputum to Save a Life

One evening, in a ward of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital, Fu Mao, a patient suffering from severe esophageal and tracheal cancer, experienced a sudden deterioration of his condition. His trachea was blocked by pus, blood, and phlegm, making it extremely difficult for him to breathe. He thrashed and struggled violently, covered in sweat. Due to systemic hypoxia, his hands and feet turned purple. Doctors and nurses urgently used an electric suction device to remove the pus, blood, and phlegm from the tracheal tube. However, the phlegm inside was too thick, and in this emergency, the electric suction device suddenly malfunctioned. Seeing the patient's suffering, young Doctor Zhan Jiwei felt as if her own family member was in pain. Although she was not the doctor assigned to treat this patient, she could not bear to walk away. Just as the patient was in extreme danger, she remembered the stories of Communist Party doctors sucking sputum for wounded soldiers with their mouths during the Liberation War. Without hesitation, she stepped forward and used her mouth to suck the pus, blood, and phlegm from the tube for the patient, and the patient was saved. Although Fu Mao, who had just caught his breath, could not speak, tears of gratitude streamed down his face as he gave Doctor Zhan a thumbs-up, expressing his infinite respect.

Sending a Young Patient Home

In the home of a farmer in Pengjiazhuang Village, Xinle County, Hebei Province, a crowd of people gathered. They were enthusiastically welcoming a guest from Beijing.

Recently, the following happened in Pengjiazhuang: Ma Xiaoyan, a nine-year-old boy from this village, was treated at the Beijing Tongren Hospital and had recovered. The hospital had contacted the young patient's parents several times, but Ma Xiaoyan's father was too busy with farm work to come to Beijing to pick him up. So, the hospital sent someone to take Xiaoyan home. Because Xiaoyan is a Hui Muslim, the Tongren Hospital's Muslim canteen prepared food for him to eat on the way. The whole village knew about this. Xiaoyan's parents were overjoyed. They heated water and prepared food to warmly welcome the guest. Xiaoyan's father said, "I'm just a farmer and don't know how to talk, but I am infinitely grateful!"

Everything must be convenient for the patient, and a trend is forming at Tongren Hospital, with many improvements in the work of the admissions office. Patients are sent home by car when they are discharged, and the fare is not expensive. Many patients say, "The hospital is so good to patients now, staying in the hospital is like being at home."

Pleasantly Surprised

One morning, Li Shengyun, a worker from the motorcade, received a phone call from the outpatient clinic ward of the Children's Hospital, and in a panic, he couldn't even hear the phone call clearly. He rushed to the hospital with a heavy heart. When he met the doctor, he slowly said, "Should my child be cremated or how should it be handled?" The doctor told him, "No! The child is getting better, and we called to ask you to bring milk for the child." Li Shengyun smiled in surprise.

Li Shengyun's first child, Xiao Shumin, had only been born for four days when she contracted pneumonia, sepsis, and several other illnesses. She had constant convulsions, and her hands and feet were already cold. Her parents took the child to the hospital that night, feeling that the child's condition was serious and difficult to save. They couldn't bear to watch the child die, so they both silently went home.

Late at night, while many people were asleep, Doctor Shi Huiping was still guarding Xiao Shumin's bedside, carefully observing the changes in her condition. When she found that the child's convulsions were severe and that she had laryngospasm, she gave her injections and artificial respiration in time; when she saw that her heartbeat was not good, she immediately gave her a cardiotonic injection; when her body temperature did not drop, she gave her a tepid bath... After several hours of timely rescue, Xiao Shumin was out of danger. Only after she fell asleep peacefully did the doctor breathe a sigh of relief and quietly leave.

Now, the child's mother is happily holding Xiao Shumin as she is discharged from the hospital.

The Vigor of the Old Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor

In the internal medicine clinic of the Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, there is an elderly traditional Chinese medicine doctor giving patients energetic consultations. This is the famous traditional Chinese medicine doctor Zhang Juren.

Mr. Zhang Juren is already seventy-seven years old this year. However, his vigor is no less than that of a young man. He is a traditional Chinese medicine consultant at the hospital and originally only worked half days and rarely saw patients. Now, he goes to the clinic every morning to see patients, and in the afternoon, he also takes time to organize his clinical experience. Zhang Juren has been practicing medicine for more than forty years and has rich experience in treating seasonal diseases. Recently, he and his student, Wang Xi, who works at the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, are organizing this experience and writing a "Medical Talk" to dedicate it to the people.

Why is this nearly eighty-year-old man so energetic? He said that after the rectification movement, his thinking has been liberated. Everyone is making a great leap forward, and I am no longer conservative and am willing to take out what is in my head.

    看！谁家的红旗最鲜艳
    吮痰救命的医生
    一天傍晚，在中苏友谊医院的一间病房里，患着严重的食道气管癌瘤的傅茂病情发生了恶变，气管被脓血和痰堵塞，呼吸非常困难，憋得乱跳乱打，满头大汗，由于全身缺氧，手脚都发紫了，大夫和护士急忙用电吸引器从气管切开插进的皮管里往外吸脓血和痰。但是里边的浓痰太稠了，在这紧急的情况下，电吸取器也突然不好用了。年青的大夫詹季维见到病人痛苦的情况，就像自己亲人受痛苦一样，虽然不是她分工治疗的病人，但是她却不忍走开。正当病人极端危险时，在她脑海里闪过在解放战争期间共产党员大夫为伤病员用嘴吸痰的事迹，她就毫不犹豫地上前用嘴为病人从皮管往外吮出了脓血和痰，病人才转危为安。刚缓过气来的傅茂虽还说不出话来，脸上流着感激的眼泪，伸着大拇指向詹大夫表示内心无限的敬意。
    送小病人回家
    在河北新乐县彭家庄一个农户的家里，挤满了人。人们在热情地欢迎一位来自北京的客人。
    彭家庄最近发生这样一件事：这村九岁的马小眼在北京同仁医院治病，病已经好了。医院和小病人的家长联系过几次，但是马小眼的爸爸因为农活忙，没有时间来北京接他。于是医院就派人把小眼送回家来了。因小眼是回民，事前同仁医院的回民食堂还为他准备好路上吃的东西。这件事传遍了全村。小眼的爸妈高兴极了。他们又烧水又作饭热情地招待客人。小眼的爸爸说：“我是个庄稼汉不会说话，心里可感谢不尽啊！”
    一切要便利病人，在同仁医院正在形成热潮，住院处的工作也有很多改进。病人出院时有小汽车送回家，车费也不贵。许多病人说：“现在医院对病人太好了，住病院像在家一样。”
    喜出望外
    一天清晨，汽车队工人李生云接到儿童医院三条门诊部病房的电话后，急得电话都没听清，就怀着沉痛的心情往医院赶，他见到大夫慢慢地说：“我的孩子是火葬还是怎样处理？”大夫告诉他说：“哪里！孩子见好了，打电话是让你给孩子带奶来。”李生云喜出望外的笑起来。
    李生云的头生孩子小淑敏，刚出生四天，就患了肺炎、败血症等好几种病症。抽风不止，手脚已发凉。他们夫妇把孩子当晚送到医院里后，感到孩子病情严重，很难挽救，不忍心看着孩子死去，两个人都默默地回家了。
    夜深了，多少人都在熟睡着，大夫施惠平还守在小淑敏的床边，时刻留心观察她的病情变化，发现孩子抽风厉害了，有喉头痉挛现象，及时打针和作人工呼吸；见心脏跳动不好，又立即打强心针；体温不下降就擦温水澡……几个钟头及时的抢救，小淑敏脱离了危险，当她安静地睡好后，大夫才松口气悄悄地离去。
    现在，这个孩子的妈妈愉快地抱着小淑敏出院了。

    老中医的干劲
    在北京市中医院门诊部内科诊疗室，有一位上了年纪的中医精神奕奕地给病人看病，这就是著名中医张菊人。
    张菊人老先生今年已经七十七岁了。但是他的干劲并不亚于青年人。他是中医医院的中医顾问，原来只上半天班，很少给病人看病。现在每天上午到门诊给病人看病，下午还抓时间整理临床经验。张菊人行医四十多年，在治疗时令病方面有着丰富的经验，最近他和他的学生、在中医医院工作的王洗正在整理这些经验，写成“医话”，把它献给人民。
    这位年近八十的老先生为什么劲头这么大呢？他说，经过整风运动，思想解放了，大家都在大跃进，我也不保守了，愿意把自己脑子里的东西拿出来。
