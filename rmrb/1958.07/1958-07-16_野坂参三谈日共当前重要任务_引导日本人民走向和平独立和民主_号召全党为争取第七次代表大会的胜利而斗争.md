Xinhua News Agency, July 15th, Tokyo News:  Nozaka Sanzō, First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a written statement today – the 36th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party – emphasizing the great significance of the tasks the party currently bears and calling on all party members to unite and redouble their efforts to ensure the success of the upcoming Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party.

In his statement, Nozaka pointed out that since its founding, the Japanese Communist Party has overcome many difficulties and obstacles, always stood at the forefront of the Japanese people, and launched a revolutionary struggle against imperialism and for democracy and national liberation.

When discussing the current domestic and international situation, Nozaka pointed out that the second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet has emerged as the most reactionary cabinet since the war.  It follows the war policies of U.S. imperialism and caters to the ambitions of the Japanese monopoly capitalist groups, is reviving militarism, and is implementing blatant reactionary policies. Nozaka pointed out that the reactionary policies pursued by the Kishi Nobusuke government threaten peace and Japan's independence and democracy, and threaten the lives of the working people.

Nozaka said that the Japanese working class and people resolutely oppose the reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government.  They have stood up and are seeking effective ways and struggle strategies to prevent these reactionary policies and hope to receive correct leadership.

Nozaka emphasized: We should point out to the masses of the people the correct path towards peace, independence, democracy, and social development. This is the urgent task of the Japanese Communist Party, as the vanguard of the Japanese working class, at the present time.

Referring to the Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party, Nozaka said: We must not only make this congress a significant one that opens a new page in the history of the Japanese Communist Party, but also make it a congress that brings new development and progress to the struggle of the Japanese working class and people. Nozaka finally called on all members of the Japanese Communist Party to unite and strive for the victory of the Party's Seventh Congress.

According to the "Akahata" newspaper, the Japanese Communist Party will hold various gatherings today and tomorrow in Osaka, Sendai, and other places to commemorate the 36th anniversary of its founding.

Xinhua News Agency, July 15th, TASS, Tokyo, July 15th: The 23rd Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, held in Tokyo, concluded on the 11th. The meeting, which began on the 5th, lasted for seven days. According to a communiqué issued by the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party in the "Akahata" newspaper, the meeting discussed the opinions of party members in various regions on the draft party constitution, and then adopted the final draft party constitution, which will be submitted to the upcoming Seventh Party Congress for discussion.
