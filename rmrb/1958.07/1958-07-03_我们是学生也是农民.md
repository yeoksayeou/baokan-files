    We are students and also farmers. This spring, many of our students were already attending classes in the fields. Some people say: "Working in the fields all day like farmers, what can you learn?" We say we learn too much. In the past, some students mistook corn for sorghum, tomato seedlings for potato seedlings. When hoeing corn, they left the big weeds and hoed away the corn seedlings. But now, second-year students can grasp the growth process of major crops and have accumulated some experience in achieving high yields. In labor, our thoughts and feelings have also undergone profound changes. Before, "At the first sign of rain, our brows would furrow and our hearts would panic, rushing to find our rubber shoes and umbrellas, afraid of getting our fancy clothes dirty." Now it's, "At the first sign of rain, we shout 'Hurrah!' and clap our hands, the crops have water to grow strong, this year's harvest is promising." In labor, our enthusiasm soars to the sky. When the fields lack fertilizer, we grind chicken and fish bones into powder, burn straw ropes and tree bark into ash, and collect eggshells to make eggshell powder. Recently, due to the drought, the students push waterwheels themselves, working until after 1 a.m., and then appear in the fields again at 4 a.m. the next morning. Even if it doesn't rain all year, we will still achieve a thousand catties of cotton and grain and ten thousand catties of sweet potatoes.

    我们是学生也是农民
    农业大学植物保护系学生　陈巽祯
    我们是学生也是农民，今春我们不少学生就已经在田间上课了。有人说：和农民一样整天在庄稼地里干活，能学些什么呢？我们说学的东西太多了。过去有的学生把玉米当高粱，番茄苗当土豆苗，中耕玉米时，把大的野草留下而把玉米苗锄掉了，但是，现在二年级的学生就能掌握主要农作物的生长过程，并且积累了一些丰产经验。在劳动中我们的思想感情也发生了深刻的变化。从前“一看要下雨，眉头一皱心发慌，胶鞋雨伞急忙找，唯恐弄脏花衣裳”，现在是“一看要下雨，高喊万岁拍巴掌，庄稼有水长的旺，今年丰收有指望”。在劳动中我们的干劲冲天。地里缺少肥料，我们就把鸡、鱼骨头磨成粉，把草绳树皮烧成灰，搜集蛋壳做成蛋壳粉。最近天旱，学生们自己推水车，干到深夜一点多钟，第二天上午四点钟又出现在田间。哪怕一年不下雨，我们也要千斤棉粮万斤薯。
