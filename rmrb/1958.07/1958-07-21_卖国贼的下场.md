[On the square, a burst of urgent gongs and drums. Two Iraqi uprising fighters run on from the left and right, holding guns. They meet, shake hands, and embrace, filled with the joy of victory.]
Fighter A Fighter B: We are victorious!
      (The surrounding crowd cheers: Great! Victory!)
Fighter A: Compatriots, we have overthrown the utterly reactionary Faisal dynasty!
      (The surrounding crowd cheers: Great! Long live the victory of the Iraqi people!)
Fighter B: Compatriots, from now on, we are an independent and autonomous Republic of Iraq!
      (The surrounding crowd shouts: Long live the Republic of Iraq! Long live!)
Fighter A: Compatriots, friends, we will no longer be oppressed and exploited by the American government! No longer be oppressed and enslaved by imperialism! We are independent!
      (The surrounding crowd cheers: Down with imperialism! Oppose imperialist aggression!)
Fighter B: Compatriots, friends, now we must ask everyone to help us find the most reactionary King and Prime Minister. They have already fled, and we know they have not yet left our country. In order to avenge the millions of suffering compatriots, we must find these two reactionary guys. Please help us find them quickly!
      (The surrounding crowd shouts: Yes! We must find them!)
Fighter A: Yes! Compatriots, we must catch them! We must not let them escape. Everyone, help us find them!
      (The surrounding crowd shouts: Find them! Find them!)
      (Fighters A and B exit, searching.)
      (Another burst of urgent gongs and drums. The Iraqi Prime Minister, disguised as a woman, runs on, followed by his secretary, staggering. The secretary stumbles and falls to the ground in a panic, too frightened to get up.)
Secretary: My Allah, this is terrible, terrible, may Allah protect us! ...
Prime Minister: (In a female voice) Get up, you useless thing!
Secretary: (Struggling to get up) Oh, my Prime Minister! ...
Prime Minister: (In a female voice) What Prime Minister, I am your wife!
Secretary: Wife... wife, everything is over. The King has also fled, and Crown Prince Ilah has been killed. It looks like we are doomed!
Prime Minister: (In a female voice, feigning composure) Calm down... calm down!
Secretary: It's over, they will settle accounts with us! ... Our car is also gone, what should we do, what should we do!
Prime Minister: (Resuming male voice, crudely) What are you afraid of, you coward!
Secretary: Ah! My Prime Minister, you don't look like a woman at all.
Prime Minister: Don't be afraid! I have disguised myself as a woman to escape six times, and no one has ever recognized me. Let's go quickly!
Secretary: My Prime Minister, there are people everywhere, where can we escape to!
Prime Minister: The Americans will send a plane to save us, quickly go to the airport!
Secretary: The airport! Alas! The airport has been occupied by the revolutionary army!
Prime Minister: Ah! Then, then quickly send a telegram to Britain!
Secretary: Yes, send a telegram! ... Alas! There is no transmitter, the radio station has also been occupied by them!
Prime Minister: Then, quickly run with me to the seaside!
      (Seeing people coming) People are coming, (female voice)
    Remember, I am your wife!
      (Uprising fighters A and B enter, encountering the Prime Minister and Secretary.)
Fighter B: Hey, compatriot! Have you seen the Prime Minister?
Secretary: (Answering in a panic) No, no, no, no! (Trying to escape)
Fighter A: Stop!
Fighter B: Come back! Who are you!
Secretary: (Trembling) We are... are ordinary citizens.
Fighter B: Who is she to you?
Secretary: He, he is my... my wife!
Fighter A: (Questioning the Prime Minister) What do you do?
Secretary: (Rushing to answer) She, she doesn't do anything, she hasn't done anything!
Fighter A: (Questioning the Prime Minister) Why don't you speak?
Secretary: He, he...
Fighter A: Don't you speak! (To the Prime Minister) You say, what do you do?
Prime Minister: (Female voice) I, I am a movie star.
Fighter A: Movie star? What's your name?
Prime Minister: Ali Basi.
Fighter A: Ali Basi is taller than you. You are not Ali Basi.
Prime Minister: Yes, yes, I am not wearing high heels today. I would be taller if I wore high heels.
Fighter A: Why is your voice so strange!
Prime Minister: Ah, my voice, I sang too much these days and it became hoarse. ...
Fighter A: Shut up! Are you male or female?
Prime Minister: Is... is male; no, not male; no, no, is female!
Secretary: No, he is not... not male, is female!
Fighter A: (Abruptly pulls off the headscarf from the Prime Minister's head) Stop pretending!
Prime Minister: Ah! (Prepares to pull out a pistol, but is alertly knocked away by Fighter B)
Fighter B: Stop, hands up!
Fighter A: So you are the reactionary Prime Minister. Compatriots, come here, the reactionary Prime Minister has been caught!
      (The secretary tries to escape, but is caught by the surging crowd. The Prime Minister and Secretary kneel before the crowd. The crowd points at the Prime Minister in anger.)
Crowd Member A: Beat this running dog of imperialism to death!
Crowd: Kill him! Kill him!
Crowd Member B: (Pointing at the Prime Minister) He is a veteran spy of British imperialism.
Crowd: Kill him! Kill him!
Crowd Member C: He has always betrayed national interests! He also signed the shameful Baghdad Pact.
Crowd: Kill him! Kill him!
      (Fighter C runs on quickly.)
Fighter C: Compatriots, good news, good news, the King has been killed by us!
      (The surrounding crowd applauds enthusiastically.)
Fighter C: There is another good news, the powerful Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have recognized our Republic of Iraq!
Fighter A: Take this traitor away!
    (The surrounding crowd applauds and cheers enthusiastically: "Long live the Republic of Iraq!" "Oppose American and British imperialist aggression!" "Long live world peace!")
