    Bi-Weekly International Review
    From July 5th to July 19th
    The Great Victory of the Iraqi People
    The revolutionary victory of the Iraqi people is the most significant event in the world today.
    For the imperialists, who disregard national awakening and always overestimate their own strength and that of their lackeys, the Iraqi revolution was like a bolt from the blue, like the sudden eruption of a volcano. The reactionary Iraqi dynasty had been a docile tool of imperialism for nearly forty years. In recent years, it has played a particularly important role in the conspiracy of US and British imperialism to prepare for war, invade the Middle East, and split the unity of the Arab peoples. In 1955, it initiated the establishment of the Baghdad Pact, becoming its only Arab member. In February of this year, it formed the "Arab Federation" with Jordan to oppose the United Arab Republic. In the Egyptian incident and the Syrian incident, and in the US subversion of the Jordanian nationalist regime, Iraq acted as an accomplice of the US and British imperialist aggressors. At the same time, internally, the Faisal dynasty used the leftovers from the sale of abundant oil resources to maintain its corrupt rule, abolish patriotic democratic parties, and impose tyranny on the people. Therefore, Iraq was considered by US and British imperialists as the most reliable base for aggression in the Middle East. However, now, the towering flames accumulated by the Iraqi people over many years have burned down the Faisal dynasty in one morning, established a republic, and transformed Iraq from the most reactionary tool of imperialist aggression into an outpost against imperialism. This revolution, which the West calls a "lightning" revolution, is indeed unprecedented in the history of national independence movements.
    What makes the enemies of national independence even more uneasy is that the Iraqi people's revolution was not only organized so meticulously and powerfully, but also established the banner of victory on such a solid foundation from the very beginning. Although the revolution was won in the form of a military coup from top to bottom, establishing a new regime, it immediately received the enthusiastic cheers and support of the people. The Iraqi people are now free from any constraints of the feudal system and have no fear of imperialism. They have stood up and smashed the dynasties of the past, killing King Faisal and the Iraqi Crown Prince, and even the so-called "iron-fisted" Prime Minister Said could not escape the people's sanctions. At the same time, the Iraqi people decisively shattered the chains of imperialism, announced their withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact, and firmly opposed imperialist threats of intervention.
    The high degree of political consciousness and powerful strength displayed by the Iraqi revolution are the result of the Iraqi people's long-term suffering of colonial oppression and struggle for independence and freedom. The Iraqi people's long and tortuous struggle for independence and freedom has always been characterized by constant popular uprisings and large-scale mass movements. British colonialists once attempted to use the Iraqi people's movement against centuries of oppression by Turkey to realize their aggressive plans in the Near East; but in 1920, when Britain replaced Turkey and established its rule over Iraq, the Iraqi people immediately rose up in a massive opposition to the new colonial oppression. From 1929 to 1933, major mass struggles continued to occur in Iraq. The uprising in the Euphrates River region in 1935 had a clear anti-imperialist and anti-feudal character. After World War II, the patriotic united front, mainly composed of the working class, launched a wider and more powerful mass movement, forcing the government to abolish the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. The people's uprising in 1948 against the signing of a new enslaving Anglo-Iraqi treaty and preventing the conclusion of another enslaving Portsmouth Treaty forced the government not to ratify the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty and overturned the Portsmouth Treaty. In 1952, the Iraqi people launched a struggle against joining the "Middle East Command." In 1957, the Iraqi people held large-scale uprisings in more than thirty cities, demanding withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact and condemning the Eisenhower Doctrine, based on the victory of supporting Egypt in defeating the British, French, and Israeli aggression. These were the four major uprisings of the Iraqi people. In recent years, the bloody suppression of Iraqi patriotic democratic forces by imperialists and their agents has been extremely cruel, and the people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle has been very arduous. But the more arduous the revolutionary struggle, the sharper the people's strength will be honed, and the bloody rule and suppression, although seemingly powerful on the surface, are bound to end forever. The Iraqi people's revolution has finally achieved a great victory.
    The Great Significance of the Iraqi Revolution
    The revolutionary victory of the Iraqi people has very important significance. It will have a profound impact on the current surging national independence movement, especially on the anti-colonialist struggle in the Middle East. This is a victory for the Arab people, as well as a victory for the people who oppose national oppression and all oppression, and a heavy blow to imperialism, especially the center of world reactionary forces, US imperialism.
    This can be seen from the sharply different and strong reactions, both positive and negative. Cairo Radio said, "The Iraqi revolution is a sign of the times and proves that the people, despite oppression and tyrannical rule, will eventually triumph." But the imperialists, the mortal enemies of the Iraqi people, exclaimed "Misfortune for the West." The British "Evening Standard" sadly said: "If Iraq betrays the West, then there is no Arab country to rely on." Senator Green, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, could not help but admit: "Arab nationalism is a force that the United States does not yet know how to deal with." The different reactions illustrate one point: the Middle East national independence movement is advancing mightily.
    The Iraqi revolution has put the imperialists in the following situation: First, the collapse of the cornerstone of imperialist aggression in the Middle East has drastically shaken the entire chain of colonialism in the Middle East. Lebanon is the first to bear the brunt, followed by Jordan. Iraq is no longer a supporter of the reactionary rule of Chamoun, and the popular uprising that has controlled most of Lebanon has been greatly encouraged by the Iraqi revolution. The Iraqi Republic's withdrawal from the "Arab Federation" has led to the collapse of the union of two descendants of the Hashemite dynasty—the "Arab Federation." The Jordanian Hussein dynasty has lost the support of the Iraqi Faisal dynasty. Although the Jordanian people's original plan to launch a revolution together with the Iraqi people was frustrated, the reactionary rule in Jordan has become even more precarious. Second, the Iraqi revolution has broken the backbone of imperialist aggression—the Baghdad Pact, causing "the sudden and complete collapse of the main pillar of Western defense (!) in the Middle East" (United Press International). The dirty task originally assigned to this military group by US and British imperialism was not only to suppress the Middle East national independence movement, but also to form an "iron ring" with the North Atlantic Treaty and the Southeast Asia Treaty to encircle the socialist camp and prepare for a new war. In recent years, the United States, in order to implement "new measures to strengthen Western defense in the Middle East" (British "Foreign Affairs Report"), has been actively establishing rocket bases in the Middle East and expanding war preparations through the Baghdad Pact. Therefore, the fact that "the coup in Iraq destroyed the main fortress of Western forces in the Middle East" (Agence France-Presse) cannot but greatly disrupt the imperialist war plans. Third, the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the US plan to dominate the Middle East through aggression, has suffered another shameful bankruptcy. For more than a year, wherever the "Eisenhower Doctrine" went, there was subversion, division, and violence. The Jordanian nationalist regime was subverted, the plan to invade Syria began, the "Arab Federation" against the United Arab Republic was supported, and the activities of interfering in Lebanon and other Arab countries intensified... But now the Iraqi people have pushed the "Eisenhower Doctrine" that fills the "vacuum" to the same tragic end as British and French colonialism. Fourth, US and British oil monopoly capital fears that it will not be able to continue to plunder Iraqi oil. The sharp drop in oil stock prices in New York and London, and the cries of the US and British ruling groups for "fighting for oil," are the panicked reactions of the US and British oil monopoly capital groups.
    It should also be noted that the impact of the Iraqi revolution goes far beyond this. The national independence movement is rapidly expanding from Asia and Africa to Latin America. Imperialists are trying their best to cut off the advance of this expansion in the Middle East. But the revolution in Iraq proves that the storm of national liberation is blowing even more fiercely in the Middle East. The national liberation storms in Africa and Latin America will also be unstoppable. All of this shows how huge and profound the shock caused by the Iraqi revolution is.
    Intervention by US and British Aggressors
    US and British imperialism brazenly sent troops to Lebanon and Jordan respectively, taking joint aggressive actions in the Middle East, vainly attempting to extinguish the flames of the Iraqi people and all Arab people striving for independence and freedom. This is a serious provocation to peace in the Middle East and the world.
    After the Lebanese people's uprising, the United States carried out all kinds of conspiracies to intervene. But because the uprising forces continued to expand, controlling most of the country's territory and important cities, and the reports of the "observation group" sent to Lebanon by the United Nations and the statements of the UN Secretary-General failed to provide the United States with an excuse for intervention, the United States turned to using another method, attempting to use so-called "political solutions" to find a way to replace Chamoun, this already unusable tool, and continue to control Lebanon. But the outbreak of the Iraqi revolution shattered the US imperialist conspiracy to intervene in Lebanon. The United States then disregarded everything and marched into Lebanon, attempting to extinguish the Lebanese people's uprising and use Lebanon as a springboard for armed intervention in the Iraqi Republic. Eisenhower's message acknowledged that "the situation has fundamentally changed due to the riots that occurred in Baghdad, Iraq, adjacent to (Lebanon) on July 14." In this situation, the US plan to intervene in Lebanon through the United Nations and thereby maintain US and British colonial interests in the Middle East was no longer sufficient, and it hurriedly took action itself by any means.
    British imperialism followed in the footsteps of the United States, sending troops to Jordan and now invading Libya. These aggressive actions thoroughly exposed the sinister faces of the US and Britain, who are jointly attempting to strangle the Iraqi Republic and, at the same time, point their spearhead at the United Arab Republic. The British excuse that there was some "conspiracy against Jordan" in Iraq is completely untenable. The fact is that the Iraqi Republic withdrew from the "Arab Federation" and withdrew the Iraqi troops sent to Jordan by the Faisal dynasty, while the Jordanian King Hussein declared that he would replace King Faisal, who had been killed by the Iraqi people, as the head of the "Arab Federation," and clamored to re-establish "order" in Iraq. At the same time, the Jordanian government openly requested the US and Britain to send troops to "aid" Jordan. It is clear that this behavior of the Jordanian Hussein dynasty is a step in the US and British imperialist-orchestrated intervention in the Iraqi Republic. As for the British troops invading Libya, it is obviously to threaten the side of the United Arab Republic. This shows that Britain is taking steps to expand its adventurous activities in coordination with the US aggression in the Middle East.
    In addition to sending troops to Lebanon, Jordan, and Libya, US and British aggressors are also conducting large-scale military maneuvers in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf regions. The US Sixth Fleet continues to concentrate in the eastern Mediterranean, and part of the fleet is heading to the Persian Gulf. The US airborne combat troops stationed in West Germany have been deployed to the Middle East, and a part of the airborne troops have landed in Turkey. At the same time, Turkey, the pawn of US and British imperialism, is also itching for action. These facts show that US and British aggressors are attempting to threaten the Iraqi Republic and the United Arab Republic and undermine the peace of the entire Middle East through armed intervention and military deployments.
    The armed aggression of US and British imperialism is undisguised. The United States used the banner of the United Nations when it invaded Korea. During the Suez crisis, the United States played a hypocritical role in the United Nations to stop the war, in order to cover up its even greater aggressive ambitions than Britain and France. Recently, the United States also wanted to achieve the purpose of intervening in Lebanon through the United Nations. But after the Iraqi revolution, the United States could not wait to do dirty aggressive deeds behind the back of the United Nations. After forcing the Security Council to face the established fact of US intervention, the United States also attempted to obtain a legal position of aggression in the Security Council. The space for US aggressors has become so narrow that even the United Nations, which it manipulates, cannot help. As for Britain, it has long been discredited among the people of the Middle East, and it is now looking for a common grave with the United States.
        Those Who Play with Fire Will Burn Themselves
    US and British aggressors have been isolated from the start and are spurned and opposed by the people of the world. Even within their ruling groups, many people are trembling with fear at the huge power of the people of the world. The contradictions within the imperialist camp are unprecedentedly sharpened.
    The Iraqi people's answer to the aggressors is to be full of revolutionary confidence and determined to defend the Republic. The Iraqi people's revolution is supported by the entire Iraqi people and the people of Asia and Africa. The Iraqi Republic has now been recognized by more than a dozen countries, including China, the Soviet Union, the UAR, Yemen, and Indonesia. UAR President Nasser warned the aggressors that any aggression against the Iraqi Republic would be considered an act of aggression against the UAR, and the UAR would fulfill its obligations to the Iraqi Republic in accordance with the Arab Joint Defense Treaty. Subsequently, the UAR and Iraq concluded a joint defense agreement. They will resolutely jointly oppose aggression and defend independence and freedom.
    The US and Britain want to use Lebanon and Jordan as springboards for aggression against the Iraqi Republic, but their feet are not standing on solid ground. The Lebanese people's uprising forces have not yielded to the US aggressor troops. Lebanese Parliament Speaker Oseiran telegraphed Eisenhower and the UN Secretary-General to condemn the US aggression. At the same time, Lebanese opposition leader Salam telegraphed to congratulate the Iraqi people on their victory over the tyrant. Mass demonstrations have also broken out in various parts of Jordan, opposing the return of British colonialists and cheering the victory of the Iraqi people. The Jordanian reactionary dynasty cannot improve its situation by relying on British bayonets, which will only further anger the people and burn themselves. It can be seen that the US and British aggressor troops cannot intimidate the Arab people, but instead throw themselves into the angry sea of the Arab people.
    Past facts have proven, and present facts also prove, that the Arab people's struggle against aggression can fully expect the full support of the countries of the socialist camp. China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries have all issued warnings to the US and British aggressors. Six hundred million Chinese people and the people of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries have enthusiastically held mass rallies and demonstrations, expressing their hatred for imperialist aggressors and their sympathy for the Iraqi, Lebanese, Jordanian, and all Arab peoples. Nasser's talks with Khrushchev and the Iraqi Republic's decision to recognize our country and restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union show the militant friendship between the people of socialist countries and the Arab people. This is absolutely not to be ignored by imperialists. Can the US and British aggressors really not review the lessons of the Korean War, the Egyptian incident, and the Syrian incident, and can they not estimate the undeniable situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind?
    In stark contrast, the US and British aggressors are in an unprecedentedly isolated and contradictory situation in their own camp and in the entire capitalist world. According to United Press International, in the capitals of the Atlantic Group countries, "officials are taking a hands-off attitude to the whole thing." The UN "observation group" in Lebanon issued a statement that it would not cooperate with non-Lebanese troops in Lebanon. Austria announced the closure of its western airspace, prohibiting foreign aircraft from transiting. Saudi Arabia also denied allowing US aircraft to pass through its airspace. The Swedish Foreign Minister stated his opposition to US interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. Even within the United States and Britain, not only are the broad masses of people opposed to their governments' aggressive actions, but even many people within the ruling groups, including those who have always supported "power politics," have issued calls against adventurism and made pessimistic predictions about the outcome of the aggression. US Senator Jenner said: "Remember the Korean War, this is a war you cannot win." The US "Daily Mirror" pointed out: "If we fail in the Middle East, we will lose the last chance to defend our political and economic position in the world." The debate on the Middle East situation in the British House of Parliament was even more chaotic. Many Labor MPs demanded: "We cannot go on a military adventure in the Middle East with the Americans" (Bevan), because the consequences of intervention "will end in another disastrous defeat for Anglo-American policy" (Crossman). Reality is so merciless to those who ignore it: imperialists can only draw pessimistic conclusions for their aggressive adventures, and cannot draw any other conclusions.

    半月国际述评
    从七月五日到十九日
    伊拉克人民的伟大胜利
    伊拉克人民的革命胜利，是目前世界上最重大的事件。
    对于无视民族的觉醒，而总是高估自己及其奴仆的力量的帝国主义者来说，伊拉克革命有如晴天霹雳，有如火山的突然爆发。伊拉克反动王朝近四十年来一直是帝国主义的驯顺工具。近年来，它在美英帝国主义准备战争、侵略中东和分裂阿拉伯各国人民的团结的阴谋活动中，起着特别重要的作用。1955年，它倡议建立了巴格达条约，成为这个条约的唯一阿拉伯成员国。今年2月，它又与约旦结成了敌对阿拉伯联合共和国的“阿拉伯联邦”。在埃及事件和叙利亚事件中，在美国颠复约旦民族主义政权事件中，伊拉克都充当美英帝国主义侵略者的帮凶。同时在对内方面，费萨尔王朝以出卖丰富的石油资源所得的残羹剩饭，来维持腐朽的统治，取消爱国民主政党，对人民实行暴政。因此，伊拉克被美英帝国主义者认为是最牢靠的侵略中东的基石。但是，现在，伊拉克人民多年蕴蓄的冲天火焰，在一个早晨就烧毁了费萨尔王朝，建立了共和国，使伊拉克从最反动的帝国主义侵略工具一变而为反帝国主义的前哨阵地。这个被西方惊呼为“闪电”的革命，在民族独立运动史中确是史无前例的。
    更使民族独立的敌人感到惶惶不安的是，伊拉克人民的革命不仅组织得那样周密，威力那样强大，而且一开始就把胜利的旗帜建立在那样巩固的基础上。革命虽然是自上而下地以军事政变的形式取得胜利，建立新的政权，但它立即得到了人民的热烈欢呼和支持。伊拉克人民从此不受封建制度的任何束缚，对帝国主义毫无畏惧，他们站了起来，把历代王朝打得稀烂，费萨尔国王和伊拉王储被打死了，所谓
  “铁腕”首相赛义德也逃不掉人民的制裁。同时，伊拉克人民断然打碎了帝国主义的锁链，宣布退出巴格达条约，坚定地反对帝国主义的干涉威胁。
    伊拉克革命表现出来的高度的政治觉悟和强大的威力，是伊拉克人民长期忍受殖民压迫和争取独立自由斗争的结果。伊拉克人民争取独立自由的漫长而曲折的斗争，一贯地是以不断的人民起义和规模巨大的群众性运动为其特点的。英国殖民者曾企图利用伊拉克人民反抗土耳其数世纪压迫的运动，来实现其在近东的侵略计划；但在英国取代土耳其建立对伊拉克的统治的1920年，伊拉克人民就立即声势浩大地起来反对新的殖民压迫。1929—1933年，伊拉克不断发生重大的群众斗争。1935年幼发拉底河地区爆发的起义，带有鲜明的反帝反封建的性质。第二次世界大战后，以工人阶级为主力而结成的爱国统一战线，展开了更广泛更强大的群众运动，迫使政府废除了1930年英伊条约。1948年反对签订新的奴役性的英伊条约，阻止缔结又一奴役性的朴次茅斯条约的人民起义，迫使政府不敢批准新的英伊条约，并推翻了朴次茅斯条约。1952年伊拉克人民又发动了反对参加“中东司令部”的斗争。1957年伊拉克人民在三十多个城市举行了大规模的起义，在支持埃及击败英、法、以侵略的胜利基础上，要求退出巴格达条约，谴责艾森豪威尔主义。这就是伊拉克人民的四次大起义。这几年来，帝国主义者及其代理人对伊拉克爱国民主力量的血腥镇压是十分残酷的，人民的反帝反封建斗争也是十分艰苦的。但革命斗争越艰苦，人民的力量会磨练得越锐利，而血腥的统治和镇压尽管表面看来是强大的，但它是要永远结束的，伊拉克人民的革命，终于取得了伟大的胜利。
    伊拉克革命的巨大意义
    伊拉克人民的革命胜利，具有非常重大的意义。它对当前汹涌澎湃的民族独立运动，特别是对中东地区反殖民主义斗争，将发生深远的影响。这是阿拉伯人民的胜利，也是反对民族压迫和一切压迫的人民的胜利，而对于帝国主义特别是世界反动势力的中心的美帝国主义，则是一次沉重的打击。
    从正面和反面的截然不同的强烈反应中，可以看到这一点。开罗电台说，“伊拉克革命是时代的标志，并且证明了人民尽管受压迫和专制的统治，最后终将胜利”。但伊拉克人民的死敌帝国主义者则惊呼“西方的不幸”。英国“旗帜晚报”悲哀地说：“如果伊拉克背叛西方，那么就没有什么阿拉伯国家可以依靠了”。美国参议院外交委员会主席格林也不能不承认：“阿拉伯民族主义是一支美国还不知道怎样对付的力量”。不同的反应，说明了一个问题：中东民族独立运动正在浩荡前进。
    伊拉克革命使帝国主义者面临这样的局势：第一、帝国主义侵略中东的基石的陷落，剧烈地动摇了整个中东的殖民主义锁链。黎巴嫩首当其冲，其次是约旦。伊拉克不再是夏蒙反动统治的支持者，已控制着黎巴嫩绝大部分地区的人民起义受到伊拉克革命的极大鼓舞。伊拉克共和国退出了“阿拉伯联邦”，就使哈希姆王朝两个后裔的结合——“阿拉伯联邦”崩溃了，约旦侯赛因王朝失掉了伊拉克费萨尔王朝的支撑，虽然约旦人民原来与伊拉克人民一起发动革命的计划受到挫折，但约旦反动统治已更加岌岌可危。第二、伊拉克革命打断了帝国主义侵略的脊骨——巴格达条约，使“西方在中东的防务（！）支柱突然完全被推倒了”（合众国际社）。原来美英帝国主义派给这个军事集团的肮脏任务，不仅是要镇压中东民族独立运动，而且要与北大西洋公约和东南亚条约结成包围社会主义阵营的“铁圈”，准备新的战争。近年来，美国为了执行“加强西方在中东的防务的新措施”（英“外事报道”），正积极通过巴格达条约在中东建立火箭基地，扩大备战活动。因此，现在“伊拉克的政变摧毁了西方在中东的势力的主要堡垒”（法新社），就不能不大大打乱帝国主义的战争计划。第三、“艾森豪威尔主义”这个美国独霸中东的侵略计划，进一步遭到了可耻的破产。一年多来，“艾森豪威尔主义”到了哪里，哪里就出现颠复、分裂和暴力。约旦民族主义政权被颠复了，侵略叙利亚计划开始了，敌对阿拉伯联合共和国的“阿拉伯联邦”被扶植起来了，干涉黎巴嫩和其他阿拉伯国家的活动加剧了……。但现在伊拉克人民把填补“真空”的“艾森豪威尔主义”推到了英法殖民主义同样悲惨的境地。第四、美英石油垄断资本害怕不能继续掠夺伊拉克石油。纽约和伦敦石油股票价格的纷纷下跌，美英统治集团一片要“为石油而战”的叫喊，就是美英石油垄断资本集团恐慌的反应。
    还应该看到，伊拉克革命的影响，远远不止如此。民族独立运动正在从亚洲、非洲直到拉丁美洲迅速地扩展着。帝国主义竭力企图在中东截断这一扩展的进路。但伊拉克的革命，证明民族解放的风暴在中东刮得更猛了。非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放风暴也将势不可当。这一切说明伊拉克革命引起的震动是多么巨大和深刻。
    美英侵略者的干涉
    美英帝国主义悍然先后出兵黎巴嫩和约旦，在中东采取联合侵略行动，妄想扑灭伊拉克人民和全阿拉伯人民争取独立自由的火焰。这是对中东和世界和平的严重挑衅。
    黎巴嫩人民起义后，美国就进行一切阴谋活动，企图干涉。但由于起义部队不断扩大，控制了全国大部分领土和重要城市，联合国派往黎巴嫩的“观察小组”的报告和联合国秘书长的声明，又未能使美国找到干涉的借口，美国就转而使用另一手法，企图以所谓“政治解决”，找寻代替夏蒙这个已经不堪使用的工具的方式，继续控制黎巴嫩。但伊拉克革命的爆发，打碎了美帝国主义干涉黎巴嫩的阴谋。美国就不顾一切地进兵黎巴嫩，企图扑灭黎巴嫩人民的起义，并以黎巴嫩作为武装干涉伊拉克共和国的跳板。艾森豪威尔的咨文承认，“由于7月14日在邻近（黎巴嫩）的伊拉克的巴格达发生了暴动，（中东）形势根本改变”，在这种情况下，美国原先假手联合国干涉黎巴嫩并从而维持住美英在中东殖民利益的计划已经不够了，它就急忙不择手段地亲自出马了。
    英帝国主义步美国后尘，进兵约旦，现在又派兵侵入利比亚，这些侵略行动彻底地暴露了美英联合企图扼杀伊拉克共和国，同时矛头指向阿拉伯联合共和国的凶恶面目。英国所谓伊拉克有什么“反对约旦的阴谋”的借口，是根本站不住脚的。事实是，伊拉克共和国退出了“阿拉伯联邦”，并从约旦撤回了费萨尔王朝派往约旦的伊拉克军队，而约旦国王侯赛因却宣布代替已被伊拉克人民打死的费萨尔国王担任“阿拉伯联邦”元首，扬言要重新建立伊拉克的“秩序”。与此同时，约旦政府公然要求美英派兵“援助”约旦。很清楚，约旦侯赛因王朝的这种行径，是美英帝国主义一手策划的干涉伊拉克共和国的一个步骤。至于英国军队侵入利比亚，显然是要在阿拉伯联合共和国的侧背进行威胁。这都表明英国正在一步一步地扩大它配合美国侵略中东的冒险活动。
    美英侵略者除了出兵黎巴嫩、约旦和利比亚以外，还在地中海、红海和波斯湾等地区进行大规模的军事调动。美国第六舰队继续向东地中海集中，一部分舰队则开往波斯湾。美国驻西德空运作战部队已开往中东，并已有一部空运部队在土耳其着陆。同时，美英帝国主义的爪牙土耳其，也正在蠢蠢欲动。这些事实说明，美英侵略者正在企图以武装干涉和军事部署，来威胁伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国，破坏整个中东的和平。
    美英帝国主义的武装侵略，是毫不遮掩的。美国在侵略朝鲜时，曾打着联合国的旗帜。在苏伊士事件时，美国更在联合国扮演一个制止战争的虚伪角色，以掩盖它比英法更大的侵略野心。最近美国也想通过联合国来达到干涉黎巴嫩的目的。但伊拉克革命后，美国迫不及待地背着联合国干起肮脏的侵略勾当来。美国迫使安理会面对美国干涉的既成事实后，还企图在安理会取得合法的侵略地位。美国侵略者的天地已到了这样狭小的地步，连它所操纵的联合国也帮不上忙了。至于英国，更是早已在中东人民面前威信扫地，它现在正跟美国寻找共同的坟墓。
        玩火者必自焚
    美英侵略者一开始就陷于孤立，受到全世界人民的唾弃和反对。甚至在它们的统治集团内部，也有不少人慑于世界人民巨大的力量而胆战心惊。帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾，空前尖锐化。
    伊拉克人民回答侵略者的是，充满革命的信心，坚决保卫共和国。伊拉克人民的革命，受到全伊拉克人民和亚非人民的支持。现在伊拉克共和国已得到了中、苏、阿联、也门、印度尼西亚等十多个国家的承认。阿联总统纳赛尔警告侵略者：对伊拉克共和国的任何侵略将被认为是对阿联的侵略行为，阿联将根据阿拉伯联合防御条约执行它对伊拉克共和国的义务。接着，阿联和伊拉克缔结了共同防御协定。它们将坚决地共同反对侵略，保卫独立自由。
    美英想把黎巴嫩和约旦作为侵略伊拉克共和国的跳板，但它们的脚就不是站在牢固的土地上。黎巴嫩人民起义部队并没有向美国侵略军屈服。黎巴嫩议会议长奥塞兰致电艾森豪威尔和联合国秘书长谴责美国的侵略。同时，黎巴嫩反对党领袖萨拉姆致电祝贺伊拉克人民战胜暴君。约旦各地也纷纷发生群众示威，反对英国殖民者卷土重来，欢呼伊拉克人民的胜利。约旦反动王朝依靠英国的刺刀并不能把日子过得好些，这只有更加激怒人民，引火烧身。由此可见，美英侵略军并不能吓倒阿拉伯人民，反而是使自己掉进了阿拉伯人民愤怒的火海中。
    过去事实已经证明，现在也证明，阿拉伯人民反抗侵略的斗争，完全可以指望社会主义阵营各国的全力支持。中苏和其他社会主义国家都已对美英侵略者发出了警告，六亿中国人民和苏联以及全体社会主义国家人民热烈举行群众集会和示威，表示了对帝国主义侵略者的痛恨和对伊拉克、黎巴嫩、约旦和全体阿拉伯人民的同情。纳赛尔同赫鲁晓夫的会谈，伊拉克共和国的决定承认我国并同苏联恢复外交关系，显示出社会主义国家人民同阿拉伯人民的战斗友谊。这是绝对不容帝国主义者漠视的。难道美英侵略者真的可以不重温一下朝鲜战争、埃及事件和叙利亚事件的教训，可以不估量一下东风压倒西风的不可争辩的形势吗？
    与此完全相反，美英侵略者在它们自己的阵营里，在整个资本主义世界中，处于空前孤立、矛盾重重的局面。据合众国际社报道，在大西洋集团国家首都，“官员们对整个事情采取不插手的态度”。联合国在黎巴嫩的“观察团”发表声明，将不同在黎巴嫩的非黎巴嫩部队合作。奥地利宣布封闭西部领空，禁止外国飞机过境。沙特阿拉伯也否认允许美国飞机通过它的领空。瑞典外长声明反对美国干涉黎巴嫩内政。就在美国和英国的国内，不仅广大人民反对他们的政府的侵略行为，即使统治集团内部也有不少人士，包括一向支持“实力政策”的人物，发出了反对冒险的呼声，对侵略结局作出悲观的预言。美国参议员詹纳尔说：“记住朝鲜战争，这是个你不能打胜的战争。”美国“每日镜报”指出：“如果我们在中东失败，我们就将失去保护我们在世界上的政治和经济地位的最后机会了”。英国下院对中东局势的辩论，更是一片混乱。许多工党议员要求：“我们不能跟美国人一起在中东进行军事冒险”（比万），因为干涉的后果，“将以英美政策的又一次惨败而告终”（克罗斯曼）。现实对于不顾现实的人就是这样无情的：帝国主义者只能为它们的侵略冒险作出悲观的结论，而不可能作出别的结论。
