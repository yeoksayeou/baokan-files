In the great leap forward of socialist construction, the vast majority of scientific inventions and creations come from ordinary workers who dare to think and dare to act. The successful trial production of the chemical raw material oxalic acid from sawdust by two ordinary housewives in Wuhan, Zhan Shuquan and Yang Juzhen, is another example. In the past, China had never manufactured the chemical raw material oxalic acid, and it had always relied on imports. The problem that Chinese scientists had been unable to solve has now been solved by two housewives, which is a very gratifying thing.

Zhan Shuquan and Yang Juzhen, they overcame all difficulties, broke down superstitions, and took on the work that scientists do. This communist style of daring to think and daring to act is a model for working women in our country. However, more importantly, their deeds once again prove that science is not something mysterious, and once again give a vivid lesson to dogmatists. Many dogmatists only believe in the provisions in books and are superstitious about foreign authorities. In their view, what foreign countries cannot do, China cannot do either; what foreign countries have done, China cannot do if it does not have the same conditions. In short, they do not respect the creation of the people, do not respect the experience and history of their own country, and do not respect practice. Today, the facts have once again given them a head-on blow: science comes from production practice and scientific experiments, and the practice of 600 million people is an endless source of creation. To make China's science and technology flourish, we must not ignore the wisdom and talent of the people.

Zhan Shuquan and Yang Juzhen received timely support and encouragement from Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Li Erzhong, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, in the trial production of the chemical raw material oxalic acid, and succeeded with the specific help of scientific research departments. This shows that the Party attaches great importance to and cares for the scientific research of the working people. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of relevant departments, the broad masses of working people, as long as they dare to think and dare to act, and break down superstitions, then not only on the scientific research front, but also on other socialist construction fronts, there will certainly be more heroes and experts.

    敢想敢做出英雄
    祖年
    在社会主义建设大跃进中，科学上的创造发明，绝大多数是出于敢想敢做的平凡劳动者之手。武汉市两个普通家庭妇女詹淑权、杨菊珍大胆利用锯末试制化学原料草酸成功，又是一个例证。化学原料草酸，过去我国从未制造过，一向依靠进口。我国科学家一直解决不了的问题，而现在居然被两个家庭妇女解决了，这是一件十分可喜的事情。
    詹淑权和杨菊珍，她们排除了一切困难，打破了迷信，担当起科学家们所干的事，这种共产主义的敢想敢做的风格，正是我国劳动妇女的榜样。但是，更重要的还在于她们的事迹，再一次证明了科学并不是什么神秘的东西，也再一次给教条主义者上了生动的一课。很多教条主义者，他们只相信书本上的条文，只迷信外国的权威。在他们看来，外国作不到的，中国也就作不到；外国作到了的，中国如果没有同样的条件，还是作不到。总之，他们是不尊重人民的创造，不尊重本国的经验和历史，不尊重实践的。今天，事实又一次无情地给了他们一次当头棒喝：科学是出自生产实践和科学实验，六亿人民的实践更是创造的无穷泉源。要使我国的科学技术发扬光大，就千万不能忽视人民的聪明才智。
    詹淑权、杨菊珍在试制化学原料草酸中，及时得到中共湖北省委第一书记王任重、中共武汉市委书记李尔重的支持和鼓励，并在科学研究部门的具体帮助下，获得成功。这说明党对劳动人民的科学研究，极为重视和关怀。在党的领导和有关部门帮助下，广大劳动人民，只要敢想敢做、破除迷信，那末，不仅在科学研究战线上，就是在其它社会主义建设战线上，也一定会出现更多的英雄和专家。
