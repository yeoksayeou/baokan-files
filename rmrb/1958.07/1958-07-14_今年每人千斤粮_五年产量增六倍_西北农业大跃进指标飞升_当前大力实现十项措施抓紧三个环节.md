Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 13th: The Northwest region, long considered agriculturally unproductive, will rapidly transform into a high-yield area. This year, the total grain output per capita in the region is expected to reach 1,100 jin, next year, each person can reach 2,000 jin, and by 1962, it can break through the 3,000 jin mark. This is the assessment of the Northwest region's first agricultural collaboration conference on the situation of the Great Leap Forward in Northwest agriculture.

The conference was attended by the Party Secretaries in charge of agriculture from Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces (autonomous regions), as well as the heads of agricultural departments from Shaanxi and other provinces (autonomous regions). Some advanced special districts and counties in Gansu Province also sent representatives to the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Chen Zhengren, Deputy Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, who also made a concluding speech.

The conference believed that a new situation of the socialist agricultural Great Leap Forward in the Northwest region has taken shape and is continuing to surge. It is estimated that the total summer harvest output of the entire region can increase by about 62% compared to 1957. Autumn crops are growing well. Based on this situation, it is estimated that this year, the Northwest region can have an average of 1,100 jin of grain per capita. This shows that the situation in the Northwest, which has always been considered a low-yield area, will soon be completely changed.

How to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest in autumn fields this year and how to welcome a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year were important topics of the conference. In this regard, after careful research, the conference put forward the following ten measures: (1) Ensure the completion of this year's plan for constructing water conservancy projects and prepare for expanding water conservancy tasks next year. Currently, attention should be paid to preventing autumn drought and fully storing water using existing projects. (2) In addition to vigorously increasing farm manure, townships, communes, and teams should immediately and universally launch a concentrated effort to build local fertilizer plants to solve the fertilizer problem. (3) In July and August of this year, field management should be strengthened to ensure timely inter-tillage, irrigation, topdressing, pest prevention, and elimination of third-class seedlings, etc. (4) Vigorously reform tools, requiring the five provinces (regions) of the Northwest to basically realize improved agricultural implements, vehicular transportation, and aerial transportation in mountainous areas by the end of this year, so as to increase labor efficiency by two times or more. Next year, further reform of tools should result in an increase in efficiency of more than five times. (5) Before and after the summer harvest, high-yield areas should be selected to hold wheat high-yield conferences to summarize this year's wheat high-yield experience and specifically arrange for preparations for a greater wheat harvest next year. (6) Strengthen seed selection work, fully prepare various improved varieties, and achieve universal promotion next year. (7) Prepare immediately for summer fallowing and autumn plowing. This year and next year, deep plowing in the entire region will account for 71% of the total cultivated area. (8) Strengthen livestock breeding work. During the current period of lush water and grass, ensure that both large and small livestock are fat and strong, and pay attention to fully preparing fodder before and after the autumn harvest. (9) All cadres working in rural areas should adopt the method of the provincial (regional), special (prefecture), county, township, and commune five-level cadres joining forces to continue to go deep into the fields and work with farmers to improve experimental fields and high-yield fields. Hold on-site meetings in a timely manner to conduct inspections and comparisons. (10) Launch a rectification and commune consolidation movement in the autumn and winter of this year, widely conduct education on the general line of socialism, review the lessons of the "horsesaddle shape" (马鞍形) , and further overcome right-leaning conservative ideas and capitalist tendencies. On the basis of rectification and commune consolidation, universally formulate plans for agricultural cooperatives.

The conference, based on the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, proposed preliminary targets for agricultural production in the Second Five-Year Plan. By 1962, the total grain output of the entire region should increase sixfold, the total cotton output should increase elevenfold, and the total oil crop output should increase sevenfold. At that time, each person would have more than 3,000 jin of grain. The Northwest is one of China's important livestock bases, so it is also necessary to pay attention to the development of animal husbandry.

The conference emphasized that in the future, on the basis of resolutely implementing the general line of socialism, it is necessary to grasp three key links: political and ideological leadership, technological revolution, and mass movement. In terms of putting political ideology in command, it is necessary to put the ideology of the proletariat in command and the ideology of Marxism-Leninism in command. Currently, the agricultural technological revolution should focus on tool reform, while also paying attention to accelerating the speed of agricultural mechanization and completely changing the arid situation. The method of organizing and guiding large-scale mass movements should be: there must be advanced indicators that can reflect the fundamental interests and awareness level of the masses, find advanced models, and establish banners. Holding on-site meetings is an important way to closely connect with reality and the masses, and must be held frequently. Mobilizing the masses should take the form of "big blooming, big contending, and big-character posters," guiding the masses to conduct democratic debates. Inspection and comparison are an effective way to boost morale and promote movement. The "ten thousand person inspection groups" organized in places like Gansu can be conducted twice a year, with smaller-scale inspections and comparisons in between. Comprehensive planning, full preparation, key breakthroughs, creating a massive mass movement, and then transitioning to a regular consolidation and improvement phase are the main forms of completing each major measure. Townships and townships, counties and counties, and provinces and provinces should promote the spirit of communism and conduct comprehensive collaboration.

The conference also conducted detailed discussions on issues such as land planning, the accumulation and consumption of agricultural cooperatives, rural cultural, educational, and health services, and agricultural scientific research. In order to continuously push the agricultural production upsurge to a higher stage, the conference also decided to strengthen the cooperation between the provinces and regions in the Northwest and put forward a number of cooperative methods.

    今年每人千斤粮　五年产量增六倍
    西北农业大跃进指标飞升
    当前大力实现十项措施抓紧三个环节
    据新华社兰州13日电　一向被认为农业低产的西北地区，现将迅速地变成为一个高产区。今年全区每人粮食产量预计可达一千一百斤，明年，每人可以达到二千斤，到1962年就可以突破三千斤的大关。这是西北地区第一次农业协作会议对于西北农业大跃进形势的估计。
    参加会议的有甘肃、新疆、青海、宁夏四省（区）党委管农业的书记以及陕西等省（区）农业部门的负责人。甘肃省一些先进专区、县也派人参加了会议。会议由中共中央农村工作部副部长陈正人主持，最后他并作了总结性的发言。
    会议认为西北地区社会主义农业大跃进的新形势已经形成，并且正在继续高涨。估计全区夏收总产量可以比1957年增产62％左右。大秋作物生长良好。依此情况估计，今年西北地区每人平均可有一千一百斤粮食。这说明西北一向被认为是低产区的情势很快要全部改观。
    如何保证今年秋田的全面大丰收，如何迎接明年农业生产的更大跃进，是会议的一个重要议题。在这方面，经过会议仔细的研究提出了以下十项措施：（1）保证完成今年兴修水地的计划，并准备明年扩大水地的任务。目前要注意预防秋旱，利用现有工程充分蓄水。（2）除大力增加农家肥料外，要乡乡社社队队立即动手普遍地突击办土化肥厂，解决肥料问题。（3）本年七、八两月要加强田间管理，保证及时中耕、灌溉、追肥、预防虫害以及消灭三类苗等。（4）大力改革工具，要求西北五省（区）在今年底基本实现改良农具化，运输车子化，山区高线运输化，以便把劳动工效提高两倍或更多，明年进一步改革工具的结果，要提高工效五倍以上。（5）夏收前后应选择丰产地区，召开小麦丰产会议，总结今年小麦丰产经验，具体布置明年小麦更大丰收的准备工作。（6）加强选种工作，充分准备各种良种，作到明年普遍推广。（7）应即准备伏翻地、秋翻地，今明年全区深翻地占总耕地面积的71％。（8）加强牲畜的繁殖工作，目前水草旺盛时期，作到大小牲畜肥壮，注意秋收前后充分准备饲草饲料。（9）所有在农村工作的干部，应采取省（区）、专（州）、县、乡、社五级干部会师的办法，继续深入田间，和农民一起搞好试验田、丰产田。及时开现场会，进行检查评比。（10）在今年秋冬开展一次整风整社运动，广泛进行社会主义总路线教育，检查马鞍形的教训，进一步克服右倾保守思想和资本主义倾向。在整风整社的基础上，并要普遍制定农业社的规划。
    会议根据大跃进的新形势，提出了第二个五年计划农业生产的初步指标。到1962年，全区粮食总产量要增加六倍，棉花总产量要增加十一倍，油料总产量要增加七倍，那时平均每人要有三千斤以上的粮食。西北是我国畜牧业的重要基地之一，因此也必须要注意发展畜牧业。
    会议强调指出：今后要在坚决贯彻执行社会主义总路线的基础上，抓政治思想领导、抓技术革命、抓群众运动三个环节。在政治思想挂帅方面，就是要无产阶级的思想挂帅，马列主义的思想挂帅。目前农业技术革命应以工具改革为主，同时注意加快农业机械化的速度，彻底改变干旱面貌。组织指导大规模的群众运动的方法应该是：要有能够反映群众根本利益和觉悟水平的先进指标，找出先进的典型，树立起旗帜。召开现场会议是密切联系实际、联系群众的重要途径，必须要经常地举行。发动群众应采取大鸣、大放、大字报的形式，引导群众进行民主大辩论。检查评比是鼓足干劲、促进运动的一个有效办法，像甘肃等地组织的“万人检查团”，一年可搞两次，中间还可进行规模较小的检查评比。全面规划，充分准备，重点突击，造成声势浩大的群众运动，然后再转入经常性的巩固提高阶段，是完成每个重大措施的主要形式。乡与乡之间、县与县之间、省与省之间要发扬共产主义精神，进行全面的大协作。
    会议并就土地规划、农业社的积累与消费、农村文教卫生、农业科学研究等问题，进行了详细的讨论。为了继续不断地将农业生产高潮推向一个更高的阶段，会议还确定要加强西北各省区的协作，并且提出了多项协作的办法。（附图片）
