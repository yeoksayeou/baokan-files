In order to better expand reproduction

Many agricultural cooperatives in Henan and Hubei actively expand public accumulation

According to Henan Daily, under the glorious illumination of the general line for socialist construction, Henan Province's summer pre-distribution work is progressing well and quickly this year. Currently, according to statistics from 38,738 cooperatives, 38,609 cooperatives have formulated and announced summer pre-distribution plans to their members.

All localities attach great importance to this year's summer pre-distribution work. Generally, the second secretary or deputy secretary is designated to take charge of the pre-distribution work, while the cooperative is responsible by the branch secretary or the director.

During the summer pre-distribution, various localities also deeply mobilized the masses, organized extensive airing of views, blooming of ideas, and debates, and carried out mass self-education to draw a clear line between the two roads in pre-distribution work. The provincial party committee's call to "work hard for three years, expand public accumulation, expand reproduction, and store more reserve grain" has become the urgent demand of the broad masses. A big-character poster in Jianglijijiang Township, Xuchang County, wrote: "Expanding accumulation is truly wise, ensuring that we will not be poor in the future. In bumper years, we must use water sparingly, and in disaster years, everyone will not worry. Cooperative members and cadres are of one heart, and expanding accumulation will establish a solid foundation for wealth."

However, there are also a few cadres and cooperative members (mainly well-to-do middle peasants) who only care about their personal interests and disregard collective interests, only seeing immediate interests and not long-term interests, and have serious capitalist ideas. They believe that "production is making a great leap forward, and life must also be greatly improved." Individual cadres believe that "promises were made in the past, and now it is not easy to go back on them," and "if we don't distribute more to the masses, we are afraid of affecting production, and it will be difficult to allocate labor in the future," and so on. More than 40 cadres in the Xiansheng Cooperative in Quqiao Township, Fangcheng, planned to buy bicycles and watches after the wheat harvest and were unwilling to expand public accumulation. In view of the above situation, various localities have conducted in-depth education on the general line of socialist construction with accumulation and consumption as the themes, extensively carried out airing of views, blooming of ideas, and debates, and on this basis, through presenting facts, reasoning, comparing accounts, organizing exhibitions, and visits, they have carried out mass self-education. Many regions have also calculated three accounts: first, the benefits of expanding public accumulation and the harm to production if accumulation is not expanded; second, checking the realization of production plans and calculating the capital required; and third, calculating whether the income of cooperative members is reduced compared with last year. Through the above methods, the broad masses of cadres and the masses fully realized the important significance of expanding accumulation for promoting production, correctly understood the relationship between accumulation and consumption, and demanded that most of the increased production be used as public accumulation to expand reproduction and accelerate socialist construction. In many areas, due to the close combination of summer pre-distribution with summer harvesting and planting, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cooperative members has been further mobilized through the pre-distribution work, pushing production to a higher climax.

This newspaper reports that the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a circular on the issue of summer harvest distribution, requiring party committees at all levels to further strengthen their leadership over the summer harvest in-kind distribution work on the basis of consolidating existing achievements, and to earnestly address the shortcomings and problems that have arisen in the handling of summer harvest distribution in some cooperatives.

This year's summer harvest distribution work in cooperatives throughout Hubei Province has been carried out under the circumstances of unprecedented bumper harvests, with the masses rejoicing and their revolutionary spirit exceptionally high. Due to this foundation, and the fact that all localities have generally been able to correctly handle the relationship between the state, cooperatives, and cooperative members when carrying out summer harvest distribution, implementing the principle of distribution according to work, and constantly strengthening socialist education for cooperative members, the summer harvest distribution work has been carried out quickly and well. At present, the summer harvest distribution throughout the province has generally shifted from the stage of formulating pre-distribution plans to the stage of in-kind distribution, and the in-kind distribution in a few areas has basically ended. In the distribution, public accumulation has generally been expanded, and the income of cooperative members has also increased compared with last year. The Xiangyang Special Zone inspected 42 cooperatives, of which 38 cooperatives distributed 40% to 60% of this year's summer increased production to cooperative members, which not only expanded the accumulation of the cooperatives but also increased the income of cooperative members, and the masses responded very well. In Xuangao Township, Jingmen County, each cooperative's labor efficiency quickly increased by about 30% due to reasonable distribution and mass satisfaction.

However, according to inspections in various localities, some areas have also produced some shortcomings and problems due to the lack of tight leadership. For example, the phenomenon of concealing production and dividing it privately has been discovered in some areas; the distribution order in some areas is chaotic, and the matching of good and bad grain is unreasonable; some areas do not directly distribute food rations to cooperative members, but uniformly retain them in the canteen; some areas indiscriminately retain all overdraft accounts, causing difficulties in the lives of some cooperative members, and so on. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee recently issued a circular requiring all localities to consolidate their achievements, overcome shortcomings, and further improve the summer harvest in-kind distribution. The circular stated that doing a good job in in-kind distribution is the urgent demand of the broad masses of cooperative members, and failure to do so will dampen the production enthusiasm of cooperative members and is not conducive to the leap forward in production. It requires party committees at all levels to strengthen specific leadership over the in-kind distribution work to ensure that the distribution work is carried out reasonably and orderly. The circular also emphasized that political and ideological work must be strengthened in the distribution, and the shortcomings and problems that have already arisen must be earnestly resolved.

    为了更好地扩大再生产
    河南湖北很多农业社积极扩大公共积累
    据河南日报讯　在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，河南省今年夏季预分工作进行得又好又快。目前，据三万八千七百三十八个社的统计，夏季预分方案，已经制定和公布到户的达三万八千六百零九个社。
    今年的夏季预分工作，各地都很重视。一般都确定了第二书记或副书记抓预分工作，社由支书或社长负责。
    在夏季预分中，各地还深入发动群众，组织大鸣、大放、大辩论，开展群众性的自我教育，划清预分工作上两条道路的界限。省委提出“苦战三年，扩大公共积累，扩大再生产，多搞储备粮”的号召，已成为广大群众的迫切要求。许昌县蒋李集乡一张大字报上写道：“扩大积累真英明，保证今后不受穷，丰收年要细水长流，受灾年人人不愁，社员干部一条心，扩大积累扎富根。”
    但是，也有少数干部和社员（主要是富裕中农）只顾个人利益，不顾集体利益，只看到眼前利益，看不到长远利益，存在着严重的资本主义思想。他们以为“生产大跃进，生活也得大提高”，个别干部认为“过去许愿了，现在不好反口”，“不给群众多分点，怕影响生产，今后劳力不好调配”等。方城圈桥乡先声社有四十多个干部打算麦收后买自行车、买手表，不愿意扩大公共积累。根据上述情况，各地以积累、消费为主题深入地进行了社会主义建设总路线的教育，广泛开展了大鸣大放大辩论，并在此基础上通过摆事实，讲道理，算账对比，组织展览，参观等方法，进行了群众性的自我教育。许多地区并算了三笔账：第一、扩大公共积累的好处和不扩大积累对生产的危害。第二、查实现生产规划，算需要资金账。第三、算社员收入是否比去年减少账。通过以上办法，使广大干部和群众充分认识到扩大积累对促进生产的重要意义，正确认识了积累和消费的关系，要求把增产的大部分作为公共积累，扩大再生产，加速社会主义建设。许多地区由于夏季预分密切结合了夏收夏种，通过预分工作，进一步调动广大社员积极性，把生产推向了更高潮。
    本报讯　中共湖北省委在最近发出了关于夏收分配问题的通报，要求各级党委在巩固已有成绩的基础上，进一步加强对夏收实物分配工作的领导，并对部分合作社在处理夏收分配中产生的缺点和问题，认真地予以解决。
    今年湖北省各地合作社的夏收分配工作是在空前丰收的情况下进行的，群众欢欣鼓舞，革命干劲异常昂扬。由于有了这个基础，而各地在进行夏收分配时又一般都能正确地处理国家、合作社和社员三者的关系，贯彻执行按劳取酬的原则，同时又不断地对社员加强了社会主义教育，使夏收分配工作进行得又快又好。现在，全省夏收分配已普遍由制订预分方案阶段转入实物分配阶段，有少数地区的实物分配已经基本结束。分配中，一般都扩大了公共积累，社员收入也比去年增加了。襄阳专区检查了四十二个合作社，其中有三十八个社都把今年夏季增产部分的40％到60％分给了社员，既扩大了社的积累，又增加了社员收入，群众反映很好。荆门县悬高乡各社因分配合理，群众满意，劳动效率很快就提高达30％左右。
    但是，据各地检查，也有部分地区由于领导抓得不紧，也产生了若干缺点和问题。比如，有的地区发现了瞒产私分的现象；有的地区分配秩序较乱，粮食好坏搭配不合理；有的地区不是把口粮直接分给社员，而是统一留到食堂里；有的地区对超支户的情况不加区别地一律扣留，使部分社员生活产生困难等。为此，省委在最近发出通报，要求各地巩固成绩，克服缺点，把夏收实物分配进一步作好。通报中说，搞好实物分配是广大社员的迫切要求，搞不好会挫伤社员的生产积极性，对生产跃进是不利的。要求各级党委加强对实物分配工作的具体领导，保证分配工作合理地、有秩序地进行。通报还强调地指出，在分配中要加强政治思想工作，对已经产生的缺点和问题，要认真地予以解决。（方堤）
