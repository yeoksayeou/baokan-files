Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 3rd: According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, in recent years, the growth rate of Albania's national income has exceeded that of the largest capitalist countries. From 1950 to 1956, Albania's national income increased by 72%, while the United States only increased by 24%, and the United Kingdom only increased by 14%.

Last year, Albania's national income had already increased to 3.3 times that of the pre-war year of 1938.

During the first Five-Year Plan, which ended in 1955, Albania's national income increased by an average of 11.3% per year. During this period, each 1% increase in national income was equivalent to an increase of 190 million leks (Albanian currency). During the second Five-Year Plan, which began in 1956, the national income will increase by an average of 11.6% per year, and each 1% increase will be equivalent to an increase of 320 million leks.

In Albania, three-quarters of the national income is used to meet the needs of the people, and the rest is used to develop production. As national income grows, the income of workers and peasants is also increasing significantly. By 1960, the real wages of workers will increase by 35% compared to 1955, and the income of peasants will increase by 45%.
