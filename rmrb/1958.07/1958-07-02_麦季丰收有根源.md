    Wheat harvest has roots,
    Trees have roots, water has a source,
    Wheat harvest has roots:
    The Communist Party's wise leadership is good,
    The cooperative's strength is boundless.
    Last year's winter sowing faced a great drought,
    People waged a great battle against the sky,
    Thousands of troops and horses went into action,
    Fighting drought and drawing water to irrigate the fields,
    Every piece of wheat was planted well,
    Many people with wisdom overcame the heavens. (Sun Heizi)

    麦季丰收有根源
    树有根，水有源，
    麦季丰收有根源：
    共产党英明好领导，
    合作社力量大无边。
    去年冬播天大旱，
    人们与天大摆战，
    千军万马齐上阵，
    抗旱引水来浇田，
    块块麦子种得好，
    人多智广战胜天。（孙黑子）
