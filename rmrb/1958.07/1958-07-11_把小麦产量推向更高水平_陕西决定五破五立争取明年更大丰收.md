    Pushing Wheat Yields to Higher Levels
    Shaanxi Decides on "Five Breaks, Five Establishments" to Strive for a Greater Harvest Next Year
    (Our dispatch) The Shaanxi Province held a provincial wheat high-yield representative conference from June 24th to 30th, deciding to launch a high-yield movement on a large scale next year and push the province's wheat yield to a higher stage.
    Shaanxi Province is one of China's famous high-wheat-producing areas. Over the past few years, it has identified many key yield-increasing measures, and the province's wheat production has increased year by year. In order to absorb the experience of other provinces and regions across the country and further increase wheat production, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry specially invited representatives from the Nantianzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Huixian County, Shangqiu Shuanglou Agricultural Cooperative, and the Lemin Agricultural Cooperative and New Atmosphere No. 5 Cooperative in Gucheng County, Hubei, who have achieved wheat yields of over 4,000 jin per mu, to participate in the meeting and introduce their experiences.
    During the discussion, the representatives believed that the province's wheat production could not develop at a high speed mainly due to complacency. Many people pointed out in their speeches that many cadres and masses believed that Shaanxi wheat had long held the first "seat" in the country, and others could not take it away. Therefore, they lacked enthusiasm.
    The cadres and agricultural representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed that the reason why many fraternal cooperatives in Henan and Hubei could suddenly surpass Shaanxi was mainly due to their great enthusiasm and creative implementation of many yield-increasing measures. Without the idea of ten thousand jin of grain, one cannot achieve ten thousand jin of wheat. Without overcoming complacency, one cannot accelerate the speed of production increase. To this end, we must vigorously promote the spirit of "not fearing the heavens, not fearing the earth" and carry out "five breaks and five establishments" in wheat production: First, break the idea of "planting is up to man, harvesting is up to heaven" and establish the idea that "man will conquer nature"; second, break the idea of "production has reached its peak" and establish the idea that "success depends on human effort" and the theory of "unlimited production"; third, break the idea that "yield increase can only be a few percent" and establish the idea that "yield increase can be dozens of percent or several times"; fourth, break the theory of "regional backwardness" and establish the idea of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced"; fifth, break the theory of "habit" and establish the idea of "creativity at all times."
    After learning from the experience of Hubei and Henan agricultural cooperatives in creating high wheat yields, everyone believed that as long as they can deep plow to about one foot, apply 30,000 to 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, irrigate four to five times, and densely plant more than 600,000 plants, the yield per mu can reach about 1,500 jin. Applying 100,000 jin of fertilizer, sowing 50 jin of seeds, planting 1.2 million plants per mu, deep plowing about two feet, and irrigating eight times, the yield per mu can reach more than 5,000 jin. If we can add some more fertilizer and further improve field management, achieving a yield of 10,000 jin of wheat per mu is not very difficult. After discussion, the representatives attending the meeting generally formulated plans to create large-area and high-yield wheat production. Representatives of many agricultural cooperatives proposed to "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and strive to plant the red flag of national wheat high yield in the 800-li Qin Chuan next year." Through this meeting, a great debate will be launched throughout the province to mobilize the masses to universally participate in the high-yield movement. (Liu Bin)

### 把小麦产量推向更高水平  陕西决定五破五立争取明年更大丰收

    把小麦产量推向更高水平
    陕西决定五破五立争取明年更大丰收
    本报讯　陕西省在6月24日到30日召开全省小麦高额丰产代表会议，决定明年大搞高额丰产运动，把全省小麦产量推向更高阶段。
    陕西省是我国著名的小麦高产区之一。几年来已经找出了许多带有关键性的增产措施，全省小麦产量逐年提高。为吸取全国其它省、区经验，进一步提高小麦产量，省农林厅特邀请创造小麦亩产四千斤以上的河南辉县南田庄农业社、商丘双楼农业社和湖北谷城县乐民农业社、新气象五社的代表参加会议，介绍经验。
    讨论中，代表们认为全省小麦产量不能高速度发展，主要是自满情绪。很多人发言中指出：不少干部和群众认为很早以前陕西小麦就在全国坐了第一把“交椅”，别人夺不去。因此干劲不足。
    到会干部和农业代表一致认为，河南和湖北不少兄弟社能一下跑在陕西前边，主要是干劲大，创造性地贯彻了许多增产措施。没有万斤粮的思想就不能打万斤小麦，不克服自满情绪就不能加快增产的速度。为此，大力发扬“天不怕，地不怕”的干劲，要在小麦生产上进行“五破五立”：一、破种在人收在天的思想，立人定胜天的思想；二、破生产到顶的思想，立事在人为，立产量无限论；三、破增产只能是几成论的思想；立增产是几十成、几倍的思想；四、破地区落后论，立学先进，赶先进，超先进的思想；五、要破习惯论，树立时时刻刻创造性的思想。
    代表们学习了湖北河南农业社创造小麦高产的经验后，大家认为：只要能深耕到一尺左右，给每亩施三万到五万斤肥料，浇四至五次水，密植到六十万株以上，每亩产量即可达到一千五百斤左右。施肥十万斤，播种五十斤种籽，每亩一百二十万株，深耕二尺左右，浇八次水，亩产量可达到五千多斤。如果再能加上一些肥料，进一步改进田间管理，亩产一万斤小麦，并不十分困难。经过讨论，到会的代表普遍制定了创造小麦大面积和高额丰产计划。许多农业社的代表提出要“学先进，赶先进，争取在明年把全国小麦丰产的红旗插在八百里秦川。”通过这次会议，将在全省展开大鸣大放，发动群众普遍参加高额丰产运动。　（刘斌）
