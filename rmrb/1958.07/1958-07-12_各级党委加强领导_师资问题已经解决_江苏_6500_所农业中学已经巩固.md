    Party Committees at All Levels Strengthen Leadership; Teacher Problem Solved
    6,500 Agricultural Middle Schools in Jiangsu Consolidated
    (Our reporter Zhu Bingju reports) The more than six thousand five hundred agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province have basically been consolidated.

    Starting in early May, agricultural middle schools and vocational middle schools in Jiangsu shifted from the development phase to a comprehensive consolidation and improvement phase. Currently, the teacher problem has been basically solved. Teaching work has begun to get on track. According to a typical survey of 542 classes, the student attendance rate is consistently above 80% and 90% in the vast majority of cases.

    The consolidation of agricultural middle schools in various localities is primarily due to the strengthened leadership of Party committees at all levels. After mobilizing the masses to establish five agricultural middle schools in Daqiao Township, Jiangpu County, they promptly grasped the two key aspects of "strengthening leadership and improving teaching," requiring that "not a single one collapses, and every one is run well." In many areas, due to rapid development, short timeframes, and insufficient publicity and education, many people did not understand the nature of agricultural middle schools, and student attendance rates were low. Party committees at all levels promptly addressed this issue, holding symposiums for students and parents to provide ideological supplements, further publicizing the direction and nature of agricultural middle schools. Many township Party committees and village branch secretaries also visited students' homes. Currently, the erroneous ideas that agricultural middle schools are "irregular" and "have no future" have been largely corrected, and the thinking of students and teachers has begun to stabilize. At the same time, comprehensive rectification of agricultural middle schools was carried out in various localities. Some older commune and team cadres and main labor forces were mobilized to study in peasant spare-time middle schools, spare-time cultural and technical schools, or Red and Expert Schools. In the consolidation work, various localities also paid attention to combining school education with labor production, universally adopting half-day and every-other-day systems in teaching forms.

    To ensure teaching quality, various localities changed the evening class system to a day class system. Initially, many parents worried that changing to the day class system would reduce the amount of work their children did, affecting their income. After publicity and careful accounting, everyone felt that it would not affect production. For example, among 103 senior primary school graduates in Tingxin Township, Songjiang County, more than half were fifteen or sixteen years old. Only twenty of them worked as accountants or bookkeepers in cooperatives, and the remaining eighty-three did not hold positions in agricultural cooperatives. From last autumn harvest to this spring planting, their labor point income was only four or five points for those who earned the least, and only a dozen or so for those who earned the most. Parents saw that these students were not the main labor force in production, and that attending school during the day would not affect production at all. Students who were older and whose families lacked labor also suggested to their parents, "Work harder in the mornings and evenings to ensure increased income."

    All localities have grasped the solution of the teacher problem, this important key, in consolidating agricultural middle schools. Now each agricultural middle school basically has a fixed full-time teacher. To improve the level of teachers, various localities have strengthened the ideological leadership of teachers and helped them improve their professional skills. All regions have organized ordinary middle schools to link up with agricultural middle schools, providing guidance, or established teaching and research groups by township to regularly study lesson preparation collectively. Currently, all parts of the province are taking advantage of students' agricultural busy season holidays to train agricultural middle school teachers.

    The teaching content of agricultural middle schools is closely linked to production, which has played an active role in promoting production. After the students of Hebei Agricultural Middle School in Daqiao Township, Jiangpu County, studied "wheat field management," they sprayed with sulfur emulsion and cleaned ditches, saving the three types of wheat that the members thought were hopeless. After Yonggan Township Agricultural Middle School in Rugao County lectured on the "square grid seedling raising" and "nutrient pot" techniques in cotton planting, it mobilized students to make 20,000 "nutrient pots." The township organized commune cadres and members from eighteen communes to visit and promote the techniques.

### 各级党委加强领导　师资问题已经解决  江苏6500所农业中学已经巩固

    各级党委加强领导　师资问题已经解决
    江苏6500所农业中学已经巩固
    本报讯　记者朱冰菊报道：江苏省六千五百多所农业中学已经基本上获得巩固。
    5月上旬开始，江苏各地的农业中学和职业中学就从发展阶段转入全面巩固、提高阶段。现在，师资问题已基本上解决。教学工作已开始走上轨道。学生的出席率据五百四十二个班级的典型调查，经常在80％和90％以上的占绝大多数。
    各地的农业中学的巩固，首先由于各级党委加强了领导。江浦县大桥乡在发动群众办起五所农业中学后，又及时地抓住了“加强领导，搞好教学”这两个关键，要求做到：“一个不垮，个个办好”。不少地区的农业中学由于发展快、时间短、宣传教育工作做得不深透，有很多群众对农业中学的性质不了解，学生出席率不高。各地党委及时注意了这个问题，召开了学生、家长座谈会进行思想补课，进一步宣传农业中学的方针、性质，有不少乡党委和社支部书记还到学生家中进行访问。目前那些认为农业中学“不正规”、“无前途”的错误思想已大体得到纠正，学生和教师的思想开始稳定下来。同时各地对农业中学普遍进行了整顿。有些年龄较大的社、队干部和主要劳动力，被动员到农民业余中学、业余文化技术学校或红专学校学习。各地在巩固工作中还注意了学校教育和劳动生产相结合，在教学形式上普遍采取了半日制和隔日制。
    为了保证教学质量，各地把晚班制改为日班制。开始许多家长担心改日班制子弟会少做工分影响收入，经过宣传和算细账后，大家觉得并不影响生产。如松江县亭新乡一百零三名高小毕业生中，十五、六岁的占一半以上，在合作社当会计、记账员的只有二十人，其余八十三人在农业社不担任职务。从去年秋收到今年春播前，他们的劳动工分收入少的只有四、五个工，多的也只有十多个工，家长看到这些学生不是生产中的主要劳动力，在白天上学根本不会影响生产。那些年岁较大，而家中又缺乏劳动力的学生，也都向家长提出“早晚勤做工，保证增加收入”。
    各地在巩固农业中学中都抓住了解决师资问题这个重要的关键。现在每所农业中学基本上都有了一个固定的专职教师。为了提高师资水平，各地都加强了对教师的思想领导，并且帮助他们提高业务水平。各个地区都组织普通中学与农业中学挂钩，进行辅导，或以乡为单位成立教研组，定期集体研究备课。目前全省各地正利用学生放农忙假训练农业中学教师。
    农业中学的教学内容密切结合生产，对生产起了积极的推动作用。江浦县大桥乡河北农业中学的学生学习了“麦田管理”以后，用硫磺乳剂喷射并清理水沟，把社员们认为没有希望的三类麦子救活过来。如皋县勇敢乡农业中学讲了植棉技术中的“方格育苗”、“营养钵”后，发动学生做了两万个“营养钵”，乡里组织了十八个社的社干部和社员前来参观，予以推广。
