Xinhua News Agency, July 28th -- New York dispatch: NBC broadcast the speeches of Lebanese opposition leaders Salam and Jumblatt on its television program on the 27th. The two leaders of the insurgent forces said that if the invading U.S. troops got too close to their headquarters, they would fight back.

Salam is the leader of the insurgent forces in Beirut; Jumblatt leads the insurgent forces fighting against Chamoun's troops in the southeastern region of Beirut.

Salam said on the television program that if the U.S. Marines came down the street in his area, the insurgent forces would resist them. Jumblatt stated that if U.S. troops approached the area where his headquarters was located, he would be "happy to fight the U.S. military."

NBC also broadcast the talk of Lebanese President Chamoun, who was leading wolves into the house. Relying on the support of the U.S. invading forces, Chamoun still clamored in his talk for "military action" to suppress the Lebanese insurgent forces.

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th -- Paris dispatch: French "Le Figaro" reporter Max Clos recently sent a dispatch from Beirut saying that the United States is establishing a new military base in Lebanon.

Clos pointed out that there are currently 10,000 U.S. troops that have landed in Lebanon; in addition, 1,000 U.S. Marines remain on two landing craft, patrolling a few kilometers from the coast. Ships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet are all anchored in the bay. U.S. Marine helicopters are flying low over the bay. Groups of U.S. jet destroyers are flying wildly at high altitude. A large amount of U.S. military supplies have been transported to Anterias, the main landing site of the U.S. military near Beirut: the beach is piled with tanks, heavy artillery, bulldozers, and various equipment and materials for building roads and airports, etc. U.S. Marines wearing protective clothing are nervously guarding these supplies.

Clos pointed out: "People here believe that the United States is establishing a new and powerful military base in the Middle East, so it is doubtful whether they intend to withdraw their troops within a few weeks.

    萨拉姆等警告侵黎美军
    不得靠近起义者控制区
    法记者报道美国在黎建立新军事基地
    新华社28日讯　纽约消息：美国全国广播公司在27日的电视节目中播送了黎巴嫩反对党领袖萨拉姆和琼卜拉特的讲话。这两位起义部队的领袖说，如果侵黎美军太靠近他们的总部，他们将起来作战。
    萨拉姆是贝鲁特起义部队的领袖；由琼卜拉特率领的起义部队则在贝鲁特的东南地区同夏蒙的军队作战。
    萨拉姆在电视节目上说，如果美国海军陆战队沿着他所在的地区的那条街走过来的话，起义部队将抵抗他们。琼卜拉特表示，如果美军走近他的总部所在地区，他将“很高兴同美军作战”。
    美国全国广播公司同时播送了引狼入室的黎巴嫩总统夏蒙的谈话。靠美国侵略军撑腰的夏蒙在谈话中仍然叫嚣要“采取军事行动”来镇压黎巴嫩起义部队。
    据新华社28日讯　巴黎消息：法国“费加罗报”记者马克思·克洛斯最近从贝鲁特发回的一篇通讯说，美国正在黎巴嫩建立一个新的军事基地。
    克洛斯指出，目前，在黎巴嫩登陆的美国军队有一万人；此外还有一千名美国海军陆战队士兵留在两艘登陆艇上，在离海岸几公里的地方巡逻。美国第六舰队的舰只都停泊在海湾中。美国海军陆战队的直升飞机在海湾上空低飞。还有成群的美国喷气式驱逐机在高空乱飞。贝鲁特附近的美军主要登陆地点安特利亚斯已经运到了大批美国军用物资：沙滩上堆着坦克车、重炮和推土机和修建公路和飞机场的各种设备和物资，等等。穿着保护衣的美国海军陆战队士兵在紧张地看守着这些物资。
    克洛斯指出：“这里的人们认为，美国正在中东建立一个新的、强大的军事基地，因此他们是否打算在几周之内撤退军队是值得怀疑的。
