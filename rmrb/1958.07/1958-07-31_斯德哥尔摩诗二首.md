    Two Poems in Stockholm
    Zhao Puchu

    Speaking at the Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference, Head of Delegation Guo Moruo said:

    In the past, people said that traveling far required eloquence,
    But today I see your magnificent discourse defeating countless armies.
    Analyzing the root of disaster, exposing deception and falsehood,
    Weighing the strength of the masses, ending hesitation and doubt.
    The earth of the East shakes with the dance of the red dragon,
    The setting sun in the West sees the collapse of the white emperor.
    The surging tide of cheers rises together,
    To establish banners for the cause of peace.

    North of Stockholm

    To the Arctic, a true city of the midnight sun,
    Well suited to call forth dawn from the twilight. ①
    A flock of seagulls follow the whiteness of the sky,
    Rainbow bridges on all sides illuminate the clarity of the sea.
    Seeking fragrant grass, one need not go ten steps,
    A thousand spirits dance where the morning breeze blows. ②
    May you cherish the blessings of peace,
    And greet the rising sun of the East.

    ① Stockholm's summer nights are extremely short, with nights that are not dark.
    ② The city has many parks, with Greek statues and sculptures everywhere.

    斯德哥尔摩诗二首
    赵朴初裁军和国际合作大会上郭沫若团长发言昔言行远要文辞，今见雄谈敌万师。剖析祸根破欺妄，衡量群力断犹疑。惊天东土红龙舞，落日西山白帝颓。潮涌欢声争起立，和平事业树旌旗。
    斯德哥尔摩城北极真来不夜城，好将薄暮唤黎明①。一群鸥鸟随天白，四面桥虹照海清。芳草寻来无十步，晓风吹处舞千神②。愿君珍重和平福，起迓东方旭日升。①斯德哥尔摩夏夜极短，有不黑之夜。②城中多公园，处处有希腊神像雕塑。
