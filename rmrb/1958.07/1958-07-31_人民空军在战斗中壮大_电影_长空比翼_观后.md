    The People's Air Force Grows Stronger in Combat
    ——After Watching the Movie "Sky Combat"
    Bi Gefei
    "Sky Combat" is the first feature film reflecting the story of the People's Air Force. It has achieved good results in terms of ideology, art, and high-altitude photography technology.

    From the film, we saw for the first time on the screen the shameful bankruptcy of the "air superiority" boasted by American imperialism, and how the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the young volunteer air force—punished the American air bandits with their bravery and wisdom. Their brilliant victory will always be a force to inspire us to move forward!

    The film's story revolves around the relationship of coordinated combat between the lead aircraft and the wingman, unfolding the conflict. In essence, it reflects the relationship between the individual and the collective, and between technology and politics. The entire struggle process is precisely the process of destroying individualism and establishing collectivism.

    In the film, when the protagonist Zhang Lei first went to the Volunteer Air Force from flight school, he did not truly understand the significance of the high degree of coordination between the lead and wingman. He was unwilling to be the wingman, believing that the wingman had heavy responsibilities but few opportunities to make contributions. Therefore, from the beginning, he had a plan to work alone: regardless of lead or wingman, he would attack enemy aircraft upon seeing them. In addition, he still retained narrow personal revenge thoughts (he thought his fiancée, Meihua, had died from enemy bombs and was determined to avenge her), eager to eliminate the enemy and disregarding tactics. In his first combat, upon seeing an enemy plane, he abandoned his lead aircraft, left the collective, and charged towards the enemy aircraft alone. As a result, he fell right into the enemy's "bait tactics," not only losing a good opportunity for combat but also causing the lead aircraft to be attacked and injured. From this painful lesson, the film sharply raised a question: Is the reason for fighting poorly mainly a technical problem or an ideological problem? Here, the political commissar of the squadron saw the essence of the problem and the dialectical relationship between technology and politics. He said, "Precisely because the enemy's technology is higher than ours, we must use collectivism to overwhelm the enemy." After the squadron's political commissar grasped this issue from the complex struggle, like adding the finishing touch to a dragon, the essence of the struggle was further and rapidly unfolded: only by using the magnificent momentum of collectivism can we despise the enemy strategically and overwhelm the enemy; and only by promoting the wisdom and talent of collectivism and studying methods of fighting the enemy can we value the enemy tactically and defeat the enemy.

    The film's portrayal of the Party's leadership and mass political work is also relatively successful. Breaking individualism and establishing collectivism, using collectivist thought to drive technological improvement, and using the spirit of collectivism to overwhelm the enemy's technological advantage, not only became the overall guiding ideology through the "finishing touch" of the squadron political commissar but also formed a conscious mass political activity. Liu Feng shot down an enemy plane, and the nurse Xiao Guo immediately came to present flowers, which was a mass political mobilization to boost the morale of our army; Zhang Lei made a mistake, and not only did the squadron leader and political commissar talk to him individually, but his comrades also conducted collective criticism when they talked to him. These mass political works were arranged quite naturally, reasonably, and with close coordination and connection, and were powerful.

    In unfolding and resolving the conflict between the individual and the collective, the film's artistic expression is quite successful, showing the richness and variety of life from all aspects while tightly revolving around a theme: breaking individualism and establishing collectivism; defeating the enemy and training oneself. After the first battle failed, while everyone was discussing Zhang Lei's violation of air combat discipline and its impact on the entire battle, the superior called Commander Fang, explaining that the failure of the air battle to defend Bridge No. 5 had a great impact on the newly organized campaign, further demonstrating that the part must be subordinate to the whole, and the individual must be subordinate to the collective. On another side, when the mechanics were inspecting and repairing the aircraft at the airport, Zhang Lei came with a heavy heart to see the inspection and repair situation. The mechanic said to him, "This aircraft, like a person, must be checked regularly. Small problems that are not treated will lead to big problems." Here, Zhang Lei's individualism was indirectly attacked. Another example is the conversation between the commander and Zhang Lei at the skating rink. Zhang Lei said, "If the whole body is not well coordinated when skating, one will fall." The commander said, "If the lead and wingman are not of one mind, they will also fall." These plots show that the entire character is permeated with a collectivist atmosphere, leaving no room for individualism. This treatment makes the film's dramatic conflict unfold widely, expresses profound thoughts, and although the plot is complex, the thematic idea centrally commands them, making the diverse plots an organically integrated whole.

    The film also has shortcomings. For example, the expression of political work is simplified in some places. Some comrades are simply criticizing Zhang Lei's shortcomings, demanding too much too quickly, giving the impression that there is "more struggle than help." Secondly, some details are detached from the theme and the character's ideological development. For example, Zhang Lei was originally a hardworking and thrifty farmer. After joining the army, he was trained in the army for five or six years and served as a platoon leader. He had gradually transformed from a farmer with only the idea of protecting his land and family into a soldier with patriotism and internationalism; but he always carried the handkerchief given to him by Meihua, as if all he thought about was avenging Meihua. This kind of detail is inconsistent with the character's struggle behavior and ideological development, and in fact lowers Zhang Lei's ideological awareness. Furthermore, the background of the story seems thin, and the unfolding of the story's scope seems narrow. The victory of the Volunteer Air Force, the victory of the entire Volunteer Army, the victory of the People's Army, and the support of the Chinese and Korean people are all closely linked, but these aspects are reflected insufficiently in the film. Of course, it is not required to reflect everything in a film, but it is still necessary to appropriately deepen and strengthen the background related to the theme and can highlight the theme.

    人民空军在战斗中壮大
    ——电影“长空比翼”观后
    毕革飞
    “长空比翼”是第一部反映人民空军的故事片。它在思想上，艺术上，以及高空摄影的技术上，都取得了良好的成就。
    从影片中，我们第一次在银幕上看到了美帝国主义吹嘘的“空中优势”可耻地破产，看到中国人民的优秀儿女——年轻的志愿军空军，怎样以他们的勇敢和智慧惩罚着美国空中强盗。他们的光辉灿烂的胜利，永远是鼓舞我们前进的力量！
    影片故事围绕着长机和僚机协同作战的关系，展开了矛盾斗争。实质上是反映了个人与集体、技术与政治关系问题。整个斗争过程，正是破个人主义立集体主义的过程。
    影片中主角张雷刚出航校到志愿军空军中去时，还没有真正了解长僚机高度协同的意义，不愿意当僚机，认为僚机责任重，而立功机会少，因此开始他心里就有了个单干的打算：管他什么长机僚机，看到敌机就去攻击。再加他还残留着狭隘的个人复仇思想（他以为自己的未婚妻梅花死在敌人的炸弹下了，一心想为她报仇），急于消灭敌人，不讲战术。头一次作战，一见到敌机，便丢掉了自己的长机，离开了集体，单个向敌机冲击，结果，正上了敌人“鱼饵战术”的当，不但失掉了良好的战机，而且使长机受到敌机的攻击，负了伤。从这个沉痛的教训中，影片尖锐地提出了一个问题：仗打不好，主要是技术问题呢？还是思想问题呢？在这里，大队政委看到了问题的本质，看到了技术和政治的辩证关系。他说“正因为敌人的技术比我们高，我们才必须用集体主义去压倒敌人。”大队政委从复杂的斗争中，画龙点睛地抓住这一问题以后，故事进一步迅速地展开了斗争的本质：只有用集体主义的磅礴气势，才能在战略上蔑视敌人，压倒敌人；也只有发扬集体主义的智慧和才能，研究对敌作战办法，才能做到在战术上重视敌人，战胜敌人。
    影片中表现党的领导和群众性的政治工作，也是比较成功的。破个人主义立集体主义，以集体主义思想带动技术的提高，以集体主义的精神压倒敌人的技术优势，不仅通过大队政委的“画龙点睛”而成为全体的指导思想，并且形成了群众自觉的政治活动。刘峰打下敌机，护士小郭马上来献花，这是壮我军志气的群众性的政治鼓动；张雷犯了错误，不仅大队长、政委和他个别谈了话，战友们和他谈心时也对他进行了集体批评，这些群众性的政治工作，都安排得相当自然，合情合理，互相间的衔接呼应也相当严密，有力。
    在展开和解决个人与集体的矛盾冲突时，影片的艺术表现上是相当成功的，从各个方面表现出生活的丰富多采，而又紧紧的围绕着一个主题：攻破个人主义，树立集体主义；战胜敌人，锻炼自己。当第一次战斗失利以后，大家正在谈论张雷违犯空中作战纪律，影响了整个战斗的时候，上级给方师长打来了电话，说明这次保卫五号桥空战的失利，对新组织的战役有很大影响，进一步表明了局部必须服从全局，个人必须服从集体。在另一个侧面，机场上机械师检修飞机的时候，张雷带着沉重的心情来看检修飞机的情况，机械师对他说：“飞机这玩意儿和人一样，得经常检查着点，小毛病不治就要出大毛病。”在这里无形中侧击了一下张雷的个人主义。又如在滑冰场上师长和张雷的谈话，张雷说，“滑冰要是全身配合不好就要摔倒。”师长说：“长机和僚机要是心不齐也要摔跟斗的。”这些情节表现出：整个人物都浸透在集体主义气氛中，使个人主义无容身之地。这样处理，使得影片的戏剧冲突展开的面广阔，表现思想深刻，故事情节虽然复杂，而主题思想却集中地统率了它们，使多种多样的情节成了有机结合的整体。
    影片也存在着缺点，例如政治工作有些地方表现得简单化，有的同志对张雷的缺点，单纯指责，求之过急，使人有一种“斗争有余帮助不足”之感。其次，有些细节与主题思想游离，与人物思想发展游离，如张雷原本是个勤劳俭朴的农民，入伍后，在军队中培养锻炼了五、六年，当过排长，已经由一个只有保田保家思想的农民逐步成为一个具有爱国主义、国际主义思想的战士；但他一直带着梅花给他的手绢，好像他想到的只是为梅花报仇，这种细节与人物的斗争行为和思想发展是不相称的，实际上是降低了张雷的思想觉悟水平。再其次，故事的背景显得单薄，故事面的展开显得窄狭，志愿军空军的战斗胜利，和整个志愿军的胜利，和人民军的胜利，和中朝人民的支援等等都是有紧密的联系的，但在影片中这些方面却反映得深感不足。当然并不是要求在一部影片中什么都反映，不过对于与主题有关的，并且可以突出主题的背景适当加深加浓，还是需要的。
