    Eisenhower Sings a Sorrowful Siren Song (Clapper Talk)
    President Eisenhower in the White House felt troubled, pacing back and forth, his mind in a fever, all because the invasion of Lebanon was not going smoothly, and the global anti-American wave was rising higher and higher! It seems this time his calculations were off, and he's truly riding a tiger and finding it hard to dismount. By chance, he picked up a news bulletin, reading each line and sentence carefully, and oh dear, he exclaimed that something was terribly wrong, his face turned green, his complexion darkened, and he sweated profusely. The American soldiers raised quite a few questions, saying that sending troops to the Middle East was too strange: Hey, river water never interferes with well water, let alone when the two places are tens of thousands of miles apart! They said they didn't know, they didn't know, why they had to take a trip to the Middle East? Why take risks for no reason? Why leave their wives and children to enter the trenches? This question worried Eisenhower, he feared that morale would be too poor! To boost morale, he sang a siren song, hey, he has a few tricks to reverse black and white! He stopped howling like a wolf and learned to imitate human speech, without beating a gong, hey, nor beating a drum. The noisy sound lingered in the air, the wolf speaking human language was of course uncoordinated:
  "My invasion of them is for their own good, this is to make a contribution to defending peace. To protect Lebanon's freedom and independence, it is necessary to use guns and knives on their heads!..." He sang one rotten tune after another, so complacent that he thought he was highly skilled. Who knows that a jackal can learn to imitate human speech? The painted beauty in the demon-revealing mirror cannot escape! The siren song did not bewitch anyone, and the more you try to cover up the truth, the worse it gets! The call for anti-aggression is like a roaring cannon, and the anger of anti-aggression is burning everywhere, no matter how eloquent you are, you can't deceive anyone, and there is only a dead end if you don't turn back! It is precisely:
  America wants to wage war,
  The people of the world will not forgive,
  Public outrage against aggression,
  We must work together to protect peace!

    艾克苦唱迷魂曲　（金钱板）
    曾田家美总统在白宫心情烦恼，行不安坐不定脑壳发烧，皆因是侵黎事儿不大妙，全世界反美浪潮节节高！看起来这回算盘没打好，真正是骑虎难下费推敲。偶然间他拿起新闻公报，一行行一句句仔细观瞧，哎呀呀他叫声大事不好，脸发青面变黑汗如雨浇。美国兵提出问题真不少，他们说出兵中东太蹊跷：嘿，河水从来不把井水犯，更何况两地万里路迢迢！他们说不知道呀不知道，为什么要到中东走一遭？为什么平白无故把险冒？为什么抛妻别子进战壕？这一问可把艾克急坏了，他担心士气不振太糟糕！为打气他就唱起迷魂调，嘿，颠倒黑白他还有几招！收起狼嗥他学人声叫，不用打锣，嘿，也不用把鼓
  敲。噪耳声在空中不住缭绕，狼吐人言当然是不会协调：
  “我侵略他呀就是为他好，这是为保卫和平立功劳。要把黎巴嫩自由独立保，必须要在他头上动枪刀！…”烂调子他唱了一套又一套，得意忘形自以为本领甚高。那知道豺狼岂能学人叫？照妖镜里画皮美女难脱逃！迷魂曲并没有把人迷倒，要遮盖真面目愈盖愈糟！反侵略的呼声如响巨炮，反侵略的怒火遍地燃烧，任你花言巧语你骗不了，不回头就只有死路一条！这正是：
  美国要把战争搞，
  世界人民不能饶，
  群情愤激反侵略，
  齐心要把和平保！
