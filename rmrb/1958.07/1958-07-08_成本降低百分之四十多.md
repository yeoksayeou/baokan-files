    Costs Reduced by More Than Forty Percent
    The No. 5 generator in the power generation workshop of the Daming Power Plant in Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province, was manufactured in the United States. In the past, some engineering technicians emphasized that the No. 5 generator had high precision and could only use high-priced, high-grade light diesel fuel (520 yuan per ton). Using this kind of diesel fuel was not only expensive but also difficult to supply. The workers had long ago proposed modifying the equipment to use low-priced diesel, but this was not adopted.
    During the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward, the workers raised the proposal again. Encouraged by the Party's General Line, the plant's leading cadres broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, personally went deep into the workshop, and repeatedly studied and checked the machine with the workers. They finally discovered that the No. 5 generator needed to use high-grade light diesel fuel because the governor was malfunctioning. Following the workers' suggestion, the governor was modified, and low-priced fuel was tested. The machine ran normally, breaking the superstition that the No. 5 generator could not use low-priced diesel. After the No. 5 generator used low-priced diesel, the cost of power generation was reduced by more than 40%.

    成本降低百分之四十多
    浙江省绍兴市大明电厂发电车间的五号发电机是美国制造的。过去，由于某些工程技术人员强调五号机精密度高，只能使用高价的高级轻质柴油（每吨五百二十元）。使用这种柴油不仅价格贵，而且供应困难。工人们很早就提出了改装设备使用低价柴油的建议，可是没有被采纳。
    大跃进高潮中，工人们又把建议提出来。厂的领导干部在党的总路线的鼓舞下，破除迷信，解放了思想，亲自深入到车间，与工人们一起反复研究检查这一部机器，终于发现五号机要使用高级轻柴油是由于调速器不灵造成的。按照工人们的建议，把调速器改装后，用低价油试验，机器转动正常，打破了五号机不能使用低价柴油的迷信。五号机使用低价柴油后，发电成本降低了40％以上。
