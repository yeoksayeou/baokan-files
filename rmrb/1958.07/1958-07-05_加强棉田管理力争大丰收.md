On the agricultural production front, increasing the production of grain, cotton, and oil crops are the three key tasks put forward by the state. In the battle to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn crops, we must make cotton production as big a bumper harvest as major food crops.

This year, cotton fought a beautiful battle in the sowing stage: generally, it was sown early, quickly, and well, resulting in neat emergence and early growth. However, cotton is a crop with a long growing period and high technical requirements. It is necessary to carry out continuous and meticulous field management throughout the entire growing period and implement a series of yield-increasing technical measures to achieve high yields. Relaxing any link may turn originally well-growing cotton fields into bad cotton fields. During the summer harvest and summer planting season this year, some cotton-producing areas, due to particularly tight labor, delayed thinning, cultivating, pest control, and topdressing of some cotton fields, resulting in grass and seedling shortages, soil compaction, and pest infestations in some cotton fields that had originally emerged well. This is worth learning from.

At present, although most cotton seedlings are growing relatively well, they are not balanced from an overall perspective. Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, is a key cotton-producing county where work has been done relatively well. According to an inspection in mid-June, 18.7% of the county's cotton fields still had third-class seedlings. Among the first- and second-class seedling cotton fields, there were also about 15% of third-class seedlings mixed in. The county is now taking emergency measures to eliminate third-class cotton fields and third-class cotton seedlings. In addition, there are some scattered cotton-producing areas and low-yield cotton-producing areas where the yield is much lower than in key cotton-producing areas. These areas need to break the "condition theory," put in more effort, and resolve to make cotton field production quickly catch up with advanced areas. There are also some cotton fields that have suffered some setbacks in seedling growth in the previous stage, either due to severe natural disasters or due to untimely management. They are not growing well at present, and active remedial measures should also be taken. Last year, Zhao Jinliang, secretary of the Macheng County Party Committee, selected a cotton field with very poor seedling growth as a high-yield experimental field. As a result, the original third-class seedling cotton field became a high-yield field producing more than 600 catties of seed cotton per mu. This year, during the cotton sowing and emergence stages, natural conditions in many areas were very unfavorable. Some cotton fields were replanted two or three times after being destroyed, but after mobilizing the masses, they generally overcame the unfavorable natural conditions and improved the cotton fields. This fully shows that man can conquer nature. Therefore, all localities must break the "fixed situation theory" for backward cotton fields and have firm confidence in changing them.

The potential for cotton to leap forward in production is great. When the average yield of cotton fields was only about 100 catties of seed cotton, many high-yield cotton fields with yields of more than 1,000 catties of seed cotton per mu had already appeared. Wheat, which has always been regarded as a low-yield crop, can create such high-yield achievements in the Great Leap Forward this year. Why can't cotton? We must let the leap-forward increase in cotton production this year catch up with wheat and exceed wheat. In a cotton field with 5,000 plants per mu, as long as each plant averages 20 mature cotton bolls, each mu can produce more than 1,000 catties (of seed cotton). An average of 50 or 60 cotton bolls per plant can achieve a yield of 1,000 catties of lint cotton per mu. As long as we resolutely work hard, cotton production can definitely leap forward this year, and we can definitely achieve great results. Many advanced cotton-producing areas in Zhejiang, Hubei, and other provinces are giving full play to their high revolutionary drive and are marching towards high-yield fields of 1,000 catties of lint cotton. This spirit is commendable.

Now, cotton is entering a period of massive budding and flowering. The next two months will be the peak period for cotton plants to flower and bear bolls. Whether cotton fields can bear bolls early, bear more bolls, and shed less bolls mainly depends on this stage. This stage requires the most water and fertilizer, the strongest technical requirements, and the greatest impact of drought, waterlogging, and pests. Therefore, strengthening cotton field management during this stage is the key link in striving for a bumper harvest of cotton this year. All localities must correctly implement management techniques such as topdressing, pest control, irrigation, drainage, cultivation, weeding, and pruning to ensure that the cotton plants' needs for water and nutrients at various stages are adequately met and to overcome natural disasters such as drought, waterlogging, and pests in a timely manner. The specific management techniques and yield-increasing measures in each locality should be determined according to the local conditions and the main problems existing in the cotton fields. Specific management techniques and measures should be formulated for each cotton field according to local conditions. For high-yield production, we must encourage the spirit of innovation, break with conventions, eliminate superstitions, and boldly try creative and advanced technologies. At present, drought is quite severe in some cotton-producing areas in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Hubei, and other provinces. These areas are carrying out drought resistance struggles, and this struggle must strive for complete victory. Pests in the bud and boll stages of cotton are currently spreading and harming, and prevention and control must be carried out in a timely and thorough manner to achieve early prevention without pests and treatment must be carried out if there are pests. Fertilizer is the foundation of cotton bumper harvest. We must try our best to meet the requirements of topdressing cotton fields and increase the amount of topdressing. The number of topdressing applications in cotton fields should generally not be less than two or three. The Xinxiang Prefectural Committee of Henan Province recently made specific arrangements for strengthening cotton field management in the next stage, calling for a major effort of 50 days, a half-month blitz, and the realization of a "five-no cotton area" without weeds and compaction, without diseases and insect pests, without crazy branches and superfluous buds, without third-class seedlings, and without drought and flood disasters. This approach is worth promoting. In scattered cotton-producing areas where cotton fields account for a small proportion, there should also be dedicated personnel responsible at all levels to strengthen specialized leadership.

In order to implement various cotton field yield-increasing measures in a timely and correct manner, agricultural cooperatives in cotton-producing areas must pay attention to arranging agricultural work and making overall arrangements for labor at any time to ensure the needs of cotton field management work. All localities should widely organize mass inspections and evaluations to discover problems at any time and solve them in a timely manner.

### 加强棉田管理力争大丰收

    加强棉田管理力争大丰收
    在农业生产战线上，增产粮食、棉花、油料，是国家提出的三项重点任务。在力争秋田作物大丰收的战斗当中，我们一定要使棉花生产和主要的粮食作物一样大丰收。
    今年棉花在播种阶段打了一个漂亮仗：一般播的早、快、好，因而出苗整齐，生育提早。但是，棉花是生长期长而技术性强的作物，必须在整个生长期间进行不间断的细致的田间管理，贯彻一系列的增产技术措施，才能取得丰产。放松任何一个环节，原来生长得好的棉田也可能变成坏棉田。今年夏收夏种季节中，有些棉区由于劳动力特别紧张，部分棉田推迟了定苗、中耕、治虫、追肥，使得一些原来出苗很好的棉田出现草荒、苗荒、土壤板结、虫害蔓延等现象。这是值得引以为训的。
    目前，大部分棉苗虽然生长得比较好，但从全局看并不平衡。江苏泗阳县是工作做得较好的重点产棉县，据6月中旬检查，全县棉田中三类苗的棉田还有18.7％。一、二类苗的棉田中，也夹杂有三类苗15％左右。该县现正采取突击措施消灭三类棉田和三类棉苗。此外，还有一些分散棉区，低产棉区，产量比重点棉产区低得很多。这些地区更需要打破“条件论”，多加一把劲，下决心使棉田生产迅速追上先进地区。还有一部分棉田，前一阶段或者由于遭受较重的自然灾害，或者由于管理不及时，棉苗生育受了些挫折，目前生长不大好，也应当积极采取补救措施。去年麻城县委书记赵金良同志选了一块苗期生长很差的棉田作丰产试验地，结果由原来的三类苗棉田变成了亩产六百多斤籽棉的丰产田。今年棉花播种、出苗阶段，许多地区自然条件很不利，有些棉田毁苗补苗两三次，但在发动群众之后，一般都战胜了不利的自然条件，使棉田好转。这就充分说明人定可以胜天。因此，各地对于落后的棉田一定要打破“定局论”，要有坚定的信心来改变它。
    棉花跃进增产的潜力是很大的。当棉田一般平均产量只有一百来斤籽棉的时候，已经出现不少亩产一千斤以上籽棉的高额丰产棉田。一向被看做低产作物的小麦，今年在大跃进中能创造出那么高的丰产成绩，棉花为什么不能呢？我们一定要让今年棉花的跃进增产成绩赶上小麦，超过小麦。每亩五千株的棉田，只要每一株平均收到二十个成熟的棉桃，每亩就可以产到一千斤以上（籽棉）。每株平均收到五、六十个棉桃，就可以达到亩产千斤皮棉。只要坚决努力，今年棉花生产一定可以跃进，一定可以取得巨大的成绩。浙江、湖北等省许多先进的棉区，发挥高度的革命干劲，正在向千斤皮棉的高额丰产田进军，这种精神是值得赞扬的。
    现在，棉花正进入大量现蕾和开始开花的时期，今后的两个月，将是棉株开花结桃的盛期，棉田能不能早结桃，多结桃，少脱落，主要决定在这一个阶段。这一阶段需水需肥最多，对技术的要求最强，旱、涝、虫害的影响也最大，因此，加强这一阶段的棉田管理，就是争取今年棉花大丰产的紧要环节。各地必须正确地实施追肥、治虫、灌溉、排水、中耕、除草、整枝等管理技术，保证适当满足棉株各时期所需要的水分和养分，及时克服旱、涝、虫害等自然灾害。各地具体的管理技术和增产措施，应该根据当地的具体条件和棉田主要存在的问题来确定。每一块棉田，都应该因地制宜地定出自己的具体的管理技术措施。为了高额丰产，我们要鼓励革新精神，打破常规，破除迷信，大胆试用创造性的先进技术。目前，河北、河南、山东、湖北等省有一部分棉区干旱相当严重，这些地区正在开展抗旱斗争，这一斗争必须争取全胜。棉田蕾铃期害虫现正蔓延为害，必须及时地彻底地进行防治，做到无虫早防，有虫必治。肥料是棉花丰产的基础，必须尽量满足棉田追肥的要求，增加追肥数量，棉田追肥次数一般不应少于二、三次。河南省新乡地委最近对加强下一阶段棉田管理作了具体部署，号召大干五十天，突击半个月，实现无杂草板结、无病虫害、无疯杈赘芽、无三类苗、旱涝无灾的“五无棉区”。这种做法值得推广。在棉田所占比重不大的分散棉区，也要层层有专人负责，加强专线领导。
    为了及时地正确实施各项棉田增产措施，棉区农业社必须随时注意进行农活排队，统筹安排劳动力，保证棉田管理工作的需要。各地要广泛组织群众性的检查评比，随时发现问题，及时解决。
