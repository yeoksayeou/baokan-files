    "Daily Herald" Advises Macmillan
    Britain Should Not Follow the United States
    Xinhua News Agency, London, July 30th. The "Daily Herald" published an editorial today, demanding that British Prime Minister Macmillan not follow the United States' delaying tactics on the issue of convening a summit meeting.
    The newspaper said: "Macmillan is wavering, and if the Prime Minister expects to get the support of the British people, he must stop following Dulles's evasion of a summit meeting. He must stand his ground for Britain and fight to get a summit meeting convened. This meeting is one that he has already guaranteed with his own credibility. We tell Mr. Macmillan on behalf of the common people that now is the time for him to lead Britain and not to tolerate absurd and meaningless actions."
    Xinhua News Agency, July 29th dispatch from London by TASS: British newspapers' diplomatic commentators and editorials have made detailed comments on Khrushchev's letter of July 28th to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France.
    Although some bourgeois propagandists have no other way to justify the Western governments' delaying tactics, they shamelessly distort the Soviet position. However, many newspapers have had to admit that the Soviet Union's arguments for convening a high-level meeting as soon as possible are weighty.
    The widely circulated "Daily Mirror" wrote in an editorial, "The West is once again in a situation of ignorant stupidity. Once again, Khrushchev clearly spoke about the specific details of high-level talks." The newspaper said that Macmillan and Eisenhower can only give one answer now, and that is a definite date.

### “每日先驱报”忠告麦克米伦  英国不要追随美国

    “每日先驱报”忠告麦克米伦
    英国不要追随美国
    新华社伦敦30日电　“每日先驱报”今天发表社论，要求英国首相麦克米伦在召开最高级会议问题上不要追随美国的拖延策略。
    报纸说：“麦克米伦正在动摇，如果首相期待得到英国人民的支持，他必须停止追随杜勒斯逃避最高级会议。他必须为英国站稳自己的脚跟，并且进行斗争让一次最高级会议得以召开。这次会议是他已经用自己的信用作了担保的。我们代表普通人民告诉麦克米伦先生，现在是他来领导英国而不是容忍荒谬和无意义的行动的时候了。”
    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社伦敦29日讯：英国报纸的外交评论员和社论对赫鲁晓夫28日致美、英、法政府首脑的信件作了详细的评论。
    尽管某些资产阶级宣传家没有其他方法为西方国家政府的拖延政策辩解，便无耻地歪曲苏联的立场。但是许多报纸不得不承认苏联主张尽速召开高级会议的理由是有分量的。
    销路很广的“每日镜报”在社论中写道，“西方再次陷于无知的愚蠢处境。又是赫鲁晓夫明白谈到高级会谈的具体细节”。报纸说，麦克米伦和艾森豪威尔现在只能作出一个回答，这就是确定的日期。
