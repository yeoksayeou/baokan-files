    Be Revolutionaries Politically, Promoters in Work, and Innovators Technically
    300,000 Cadres in Jiangxi Formulate Red and Expert Plans

    (Our Nanchang Dispatch) Reporter Li Yuqing reports: Over 300,000 cadres across Jiangxi Province are universally formulating personal plans for achieving both "Redness" and "Expertise" to accelerate progress.

    In formulating personal "Red and Expert" leap forward plans, all localities have focused on starting with ideological mobilization. Organizations are presenting cadres with requirements and directions for "Red and Expert" planning, adopting a method of using the intangible to lead the tangible and using "Redness" to drive "Expertise," and extensively launching debates on "Redness" versus "Expertise." During the debates, conservative thinking and individualism were prominently criticized. Some people viewed "Redness and Expertise" as something unattainable and unfathomable, lacking confidence in achieving both; others viewed "Redness and Expertise" as very simple, believing that simply reading a few political theory and science and technology books would qualify them; and a few individual cadres even attempted to use "Red and Expert" planning to achieve individualistic goals. Through the criticism of the above-mentioned erroneous ideas, the consciousness of the vast number of cadres has been further enhanced, the direction of effort has been clarified, and a communist style of daring to think, speak, and act has been initially established. To ensure that personal "Red and Expert" plans are realistic and meet requirements, localities have universally adopted forms such as big-character posters, symposiums, and individual conversations to allow personal plans to be seen by the masses. Through mutual observation, mutual assistance, and extensive solicitation of opinions, revisions are repeatedly made based on the opinions of the masses.

    Cadres' personal "Red and Expert" plans generally take into account the needs of the great leap forward in their respective departments and the organization's requirements for cadres' "Redness and Expertise," combined with their own thinking and work. They propose which erroneous ideas need to be overcome ideologically, which correct ideas need to be established, what needs to be learned professionally, what outstanding problems need to be solved, and what inventions and innovations need to be made. In terms of content and measures, most have achieved a combination of four aspects: the combination of Party leadership, mass assistance, and self-effort; the combination of destruction and construction, transformation and improvement; the combination of physical and mental labor, "cultivating experimental plots" and learning technology, going deep into the grassroots and connecting with the masses; and the combination of regular concentrated movements and continuous training and self-cultivation, political struggle and professional work, political study and professional study, and central work and professional work. In units that have already formulated personal "Red and Expert" leap forward plans, in order to ensure the realization of personal plans, evaluation and competition activities are now being carried out based on the content of individual plans, comparing ideology, work, style, learning, connection with the masses, and labor.

    Through the formulation of personal "Red and Expert" leap forward plans, the "three winds and five airs" have been further eliminated among cadres, and the achievements of the rectification movement have been consolidated and expanded. An important aspect of many cadres' "Red and Expert" plans is to propose specific measures for future correction based on the opinions raised by the masses during the rectification, and then implement the plans under the supervision of the masses. Cadres throughout the province who have already formulated "Red and Expert" plans have unanimously proposed: "We must be revolutionaries politically, promoters in work, and innovators technically." A good learning atmosphere has begun to form among the vast number of cadres, with almost all spare time in the morning and evening being used to study politics and technology. Many units have established self-study groups and writing groups based on the needs of cadres and have restored the morning study system. After cadres of the Provincial People's Bank formulated "Red and Expert" plans, a new atmosphere of "five mores" (more going deep into the grassroots, more learning, more labor, more unity and mutual assistance, more studying professional work) and "five lesses" (less individualism, less sitting in the office, less disunity, less violations of laws and regulations, less sleeping late) has recently emerged.

    政治上做革命派　工作上做促进派　技术上做革新派
    江西三十万干部订红专规划
    本报南昌讯　记者李余庆报道：江西全省三十多万干部正普遍制订个人又红又专的跃进规划。
    在制订个人又红又专跃进规划的时候，各地都注意了首先从思想发动入手，由组织上向干部提出红专规划的要求和方向，采取以虚带实，以红带专的方法，广泛开展红与专的大辩论。在辩论中，突出地批判了保守思想和个人主义思想。有些人把又红又专看成是高不可攀、深不可测的东西，对红专没有信心；有的把红专看得很简单，认为只要多读几本政治理论和科学技术书籍，就算是又红又专了；也有个别干部想借红专规划达到个人主义目的。通过对上述错误思想的批判，进一步提高了广大干部的觉悟，明确了努力方向，初步树立了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格。为了使个人红专规划制订得切合实际，合乎要求，各地普遍采用了大字报、座谈会、个别交谈等形式，使个人规划同群众见面，通过互相观摩，互相帮助，广泛征求意见，然后根据群众意见反复进行修正。
    干部个人红专规划，一般都根据本部门工作大跃进的需要和组织上对干部红专的要求，联系自己的思想和工作，提出在思想上要克服哪些错误思想，树立哪些正确的思想；业务上要学习哪些东西，解决哪些突出问题，进行哪些发明创造。在内容和措施上，大都作到了四结合，即：党的领导、群众帮助和自我努力结合；破和立、改造和提高结合；体力劳动和脑力劳动、“种试验田”和学习技术、深入基层和联系群众结合；定期的突击运动和经常的锻炼修养、政治斗争和业务工作、政治学习和业务学习、中心工作和业务工作结合。在已经制订个人红专跃进规划的单位，为了保证个人红专规划的实现，现在都根据个人规划内容，开展了比思想、比工作、比作风、比学习、比联系群众、比劳动等评比竞赛。
    通过制定个人红专跃进规划，进一步在干部中打掉了三风五气，巩固和扩大了整风运动的成果。许多干部红专规划中的重要一条，是根据整风中群众提的意见，提出今后改正的具体措施，然后在群众的监督下执行规划。现在全省已经制订红专规划的干部一致提出：“要在政治上做革命派，工作上做促进派，技术上做革新派。”广大干部的好学空气已经开始形成，早晚业余时间几乎是全部用来钻研政治和技术，许多单位已根据干部的要求建立了自学小组、写作小组，恢复了早晨的学习制度。省人民银行干部订了红专规划后，最近出现了五多（深入基层多，学习多，劳动多，团结互助多，钻研业务多）和五少（个人主义少，坐办公室少，不团结现象少，违法乱纪少，睡早觉少）的新风气。
