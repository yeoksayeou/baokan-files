Break Down the "Eight Beliefs and Eight Disbeliefs" Ideology

The superstitions in the medical and health fields are very serious. It is reflected in eight beliefs and eight disbeliefs regarding the scientific attitude of medicine. These are: believing in foreign countries but not in China; believing in Western medicine but not in traditional Chinese medicine; believing in "foreign" methods but not in "local" methods; believing in books but not in practice; believing in authority but not in the masses; believing in oneself but not in others; believing in regulations and systems but not in reality and not in people; believing in technology but not in politics. These phenomena, when concentrated, are manifested in class standpoint, which is to say, believing in the bourgeoisie and looking down on the proletariat. Some people, under the guise of technology supremacy and technological mystery, ignore the leadership of the Party, believing that politics cannot lead technology. They don't want the Party's leadership from above, and they don't want the masses from below. They look down on both their left-hand neighbors and their right-hand neighbors; they want neither above nor below, neither left nor right, closing their eyes and sitting firmly on the bourgeoisie's chair. Although this situation has greatly improved after the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, there is no reason for us to be complacent when examined according to the spirit of the General Line.

The on-site conference on the prevention and treatment of goiter and venereal diseases held by the Hebei Provincial Health Department in Chengde City recently was a conference to eliminate superstition and liberate thought. At the meeting, through debate and on-site demonstrations, vivid facts greatly opened the eyes of those with superstitious ideas.

Goiter is relatively prevalent in our province. Its occurrence is caused by the human body's long-term insufficient intake of iodine, which has long been recognized by Chinese and foreign experts. However, what method to use to continuously supplement people with iodine has been a subject explored by Chinese and foreign experts for a long time without a solution. Adding iodine to edible salt is the most ideal method. Since it is an ideal method, why has it not been promoted for a long time? Because foreign books record that iodine mixed in edible salt, no matter what method is used to store it, iodine will inevitably be completely released within three months, so it cannot be promoted. After the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)" in 1956 put forward the call to actively prevent and treat goiter, the comrades of the Zhangjiakou Municipal Health and Epidemic Prevention Station eliminated the idea of superstitious experts. They boldly created the spray method to prepare iodized salt, preparing and selling it on the spot. Local endemic goiter was completely cured after three months. No new patients have occurred since the promotion of iodized salt. They not only solved the concern about iodine release from practice, but also, after nine months of observation, proved that no matter what method is used to store iodized salt, the iodine content only drops from 14% to 9%, with little change. This overthrew the "conclusion" of complete iodine release that has been adhered to by domestic and foreign experts for many years. This incident not only made a contribution to the prevention and treatment of goiter but also has great significance for eliminating superstition and sweeping away the slavish comprador ideology in the medical and health fields.

The prevention and treatment of venereal diseases is also the same. Our province began the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases shortly after the national liberation. Considerable achievements have been made in recent years. In the past, patients were treated with arsenic compound therapy or penicillin therapy. These two methods have long treatment times, cost a lot of money, and must be personally mastered and operated by medical staff, so it is difficult to promote them and cannot achieve the goal of quickly eliminating venereal diseases. In 1956, after the discovery of Mr. Sheng Zizhang's secret recipe for treating syphilis in Longhua County, it was proved by several trials that the effect was very good, and it had the advantages of being cheap, easy to use, easy to promote, and quickly cured, but it was not dared to be vigorously promoted. This year, Chengde Prefecture used it to eliminate all existing syphilis in the entire region. Shouldn't there be no problem? But no, some people doubt whether it can really be cured. It is said that because it is Chinese, it is a secret recipe of traditional Chinese medicine, it is said that it cannot achieve 100% serological cure. We believe this is a serious superstition. There are three reasons: First, let's look at the facts. Sheng Zizhang has three or forty years of experience in treating syphilis with his secret recipe in Chengde Prefecture. None of those cured by him has relapsed; second, so far, domestic and foreign experts have not had any good methods to achieve 100% serological cure for late-stage syphilis; third, according to the test and verification by the Provincial Venereal Disease Prevention Institute in Chicheng County, the serological cure rate of Sheng Zizhang's secret recipe is the same as that of Western medicine penicillin. Even if we assume that symptom cure without serological cure does not count as a cure, what is wrong with curing the patient's symptoms, relieving their pain, and restoring them to health to engage in production before there is a good way to completely cure the serum!

We must learn from experts with real talent and practical learning, but we must also learn from the people. There are many effective therapies in our country's folk that are not recorded in books. We should go to the folk to explore and extract treasures. One of the important responsibilities of scientists is to carefully summarize the inventions and creations of the masses and give them processing and improvement, only then will there be achievements. This is also a shortcut for our country's medicine to catch up with or surpass the world's advanced levels.

We must both learn foreign medicine and learn traditional Chinese medicine. Our principle is to be neither conceited nor self-deprecating. We must learn all the good things from foreign countries, and we must quickly catch up with and surpass them. However, we must never ignore traditional Chinese medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine has a history of thousands of years, while the history of Western medicine is only a few hundred years. Traditional Chinese medicine is a valuable property left to us by our ancestors, with a lot of research value and application value. It has already surpassed the world's advanced levels in many clinical treatments of diseases. This is something that foreign countries do not have. If we carefully sort out, improve, and promote it, we will inevitably make incalculable contributions to benefiting the Chinese people and benefiting the people of the world.

### 打破“八信八不信”思想

专栏：

    打破“八信八不信”思想
    医药卫生界的迷信思想十分严重。它表现在医学科学态度上有八信八不信。这就是：信外国不信中国；信西医不信中医；信“洋”法不信“土”法；信书本不信实践；信权威不信群众；信自己不信别人；信正规、规章制度不信现实不信人；信技术不信政治。这些现象集中起来表现在阶级立场上，就是迷信资产阶级，轻视无产阶级。有些人在技术至上、技术神秘的幌子下，忽视党的领导，认为政治不能领导技术，对上不要党的领导，对下不要群众，既瞧不起左邻，也看不起右舍，上下左右都不要，闭起眼睛一屁股坐在资产阶级的椅子上。经过反右派斗争和整风运动，这种情况虽然有了很大好转，但根据总路线的精神来检查，却没有任何理由使我们自满。
    最近河北省卫生厅在承德市召开的甲状腺肿、性病防治工作现场会议，就是一个破除迷信、解放思想的会议。会上经过辩论和现场表演，生动的事实，使有迷信思想的人大开眼界。
    甲状腺肿在我省流行较广，它的发生是因人体长期摄碘不足而引起的，这早已被中外专家所公认。但是用什么办法给人们持续补充碘质，却是中外专家长期探讨没有解决的一个课题。食盐加碘是个最理想的办法，既然是个理想的办法，为什么长期不去推广呢？因为外国书籍记载说，碘混在食盐内，不论采取什么方法置放，碘在三个月内必然游离净尽，因而无法推广。1956年全国农业发展纲要（草案）提出积极防治甲状腺肿的号召后，张家口市卫生防疫站的同志们，破除了迷信专家的思想，他们大胆地创造喷雾法配制碘盐，现配现卖，三个月后地方性甲状腺肿就被全部治愈了，从推行碘盐起至今尚未发生新病人。他们不仅从实践中解决了碘游离的疑虑，而且，经九个月的观察证明，不论采取什么方法置放碘盐，碘量仅从14％降至9％，变动不大。这就推翻了多年来国内外专家所坚持的碘游离净尽的“定论”。这件事不仅对防治甲状腺肿作出了贡献，而且对破除迷信、扫清医药卫生界的洋奴思想，具有重大意义。
    性病的防治工作，也是如此。全国解放不久，我省就开始了性病防治工作。几年来取得了相当成绩。过去治疗患者用砒?混合疗法或青霉素疗法。这两种方法疗程时间长，花钱多，必须医护人员亲自掌握操作，因此难以推广，不能达到迅速消灭性病的目的。1956年发现隆化县中医盛子章先生治疗梅毒秘方后，经几次试验证明效果很好，并具有价格便宜、使用方便、便于推广、治愈迅速等优点，但是不敢大力推广。今年承德专区用它消灭了全区现症梅毒，按理应该没问题了吧？但是不然，又有人怀疑它是否真的能够治愈。据说因为它是中国的、是中医秘方，说它不能达到百分之百血清治愈。我们认为这是一种严重的迷信思想。根据有三：首先让我们看看事实吧。承德专区盛子章用他的秘方治疗梅毒有三、四十年的经验，凡经他治愈的，无一人再犯；其次是直到目前国内外专家还没什么好办法使晚期梅毒血清达到百分之百治愈；再次，据省性病防止所在赤城县检验证明，盛子章秘方的血清治愈程度，与西药青霉素相同。即使假定症状治愈血清不算治愈，但在没有好办法使血清完全治愈以前，把病人症状治愈了，痛苦解除了，使病人恢复健康投入生产又有什么不好呢！
    我们必须向有真才实学的专家学习，但我们还必须向人民群众学习。我国民间有许多书本上没有记载过的有效疗法，我们应当到民间去探宝取宝。科学家的重要职责之一，是认真总结群众的创造发明，给以加工提高，如此才会有所成就。这也是我国医学赶上或超过世界先进水平的一个捷径。
    我们既要学习外国医学，又必须学习祖国医学。我们的原则是，既不妄自尊大，也不妄自菲薄。一切外国好的东西，我们都要学习，并要迅速赶上它、超过它。但是，我们绝不能忽视祖国医学。祖国医学已有几千年的历史，而西洋医学的历史不过几百年。祖国医学是祖先给我们留下来的一份宝贵财产，有很多研究价值和应用价值，在许多临床治疗疾病中已经超过了世界先进水平，这是外国所没有的，如果我们认真整理、提高和发扬它，对造福我国人民、造福世界人民，必然会作出不可估量的贡献。
