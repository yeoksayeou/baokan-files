Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Prominent figures from the Islamic, Buddhist, Christian, Catholic, and Taoist communities in the capital jointly held a meeting today to angrily condemn the U.S. and British imperialist acts of aggression in the Middle East.

Religious figures participating in the forum pointed out in their speeches that although the religious beliefs of various religious circles are different, their teachings of compassion and love, and their will to advocate peace and oppose imperialist aggression are consistent. The U.S. and British imperialist armed intervention in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries is a shameful act of piracy. They also expressed their intention to integrate the strength of the religious community into the national torrent of opposing war and defending peace, and to support the just struggle of the people of the Middle East.

Da Puchen, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association, said: The struggle of the people of the Middle East for independence and freedom is a matter for the people there themselves. The U.S. and British imperialist piratical armed intervention is a heinous act that undermines world peace. Peace-loving believers of all religions in China should unite to jointly stop the aggression of U.S. and British imperialism. Juezan, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China, said: Buddhist scriptures preach compassion, but they advocate resistance to aggression. Resistance to aggression is just, so we in the Buddhist community must firmly stand with the people of the Middle East and strongly protest the aggressive acts of U.S. and British imperialism.

Religious figures all expressed their firm belief in their speeches that the people's just struggle will surely win. Ma Wenchun, Director of the Beijing Patriotic Catholic Association, said: We hate the U.S. and British imperialist armed intervention in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. Imperialism is not to be feared. As long as we unite closely, oppose aggression, and defend peace, we will surely send imperialism to the graves they have dug for themselves. Chen Yingning, Vice President of the China Taoist Association, said: We fully support the struggle of the people of the Middle East. The aggressive acts of U.S. and British imperialism are dirty, therefore isolated, and are bound to fail. Zhao Zichen, a Christian figure and professor at Yenching Union Theological Seminary in Beijing, demanded in his speech that the aggressive troops of U.S. and British imperialism immediately get out of the Middle East!

Also speaking at the forum were Islamic figures An Shiwei, Buddhist figures Fazun, Li Yiping, and Zhengguo, Catholic figures Jia Zhenmin, Wang Ruji, and Li Jingyi, and Christian figure Wang Jinxi, among others.

    参加座谈会的宗教界人士在发言中指出，各宗教界的宗教信仰各不相同，但是各教宣扬慈悲、博爱的教义，主张和平和反对帝国主义侵略的意志，大家都是一致的。美、英帝国主义武装干涉中东各国人民的内政是可耻的海盗行为。他们在发言中还表示要把宗教界的力量，汇入全国人民反对战争、保卫和平的洪流中，支持中东各国人民的正义斗争。
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生说：中东各国人民争取独立、自由的斗争，是他们那里人民自己的事情。美、英帝国主义海盗式地进行武装干涉，是破坏世界和平的罪大恶极的行为。热爱和平的中国各宗教界的教徒，团结起来，共同制止美、英帝国主义的侵略行为。中国佛教协会副会长巨赞说：佛经讲慈悲，但是它主张反抗侵略，反抗侵略是正义的，因此我们佛教界要坚决站在中东各国人民一边，强硬抗议美、英帝国主义的侵略行为。
