Giving Flax its Due Status

The national flax planting area has reached more than ten million mu, supplying edible oil to millions of people in seven provinces and regions in the Northwest and North China, and has made indelible contributions to people's lives. However, until now, flax has not yet achieved its due status in people's minds.

What is the real situation of flax? People's accusations against flax are unfair. Flax is not only not a low-yielding crop, but it is also a treasure. Last year, Jiuquan County in Gansu Province created a high-yield record of 560 jin per mu, which shows that flax is not a low-yielding crop. The oil yield rate of flax is the highest among oil crops except for sesame and rapeseed, reaching 32%-37%; flax can also produce a large amount of useful materials such as fiber, flax bone, and seed coats. Because flax fiber has stronger tensile strength, wear resistance, and water resistance than cotton, it has a wide range of uses and can be spun into various clothing materials, canvas, and tarpaulins, and can be used as tire lining for automobiles. Tianjin, Wuxi and other places use flax fiber blended with cotton to weave more than 20 kinds of double-sided khaki, twill, and various fancy cloths, which are very popular among consumers. This fact shows that flax is a treasure.

It is time for flax to hold its head high; flax should be given its due status.

### 给胡麻以应得的地位

    给胡麻以应得的地位
    全国胡麻播种面积达一千多万亩，供给西北、华北七个省区千百万人民作食用油，在人民生活中立下了不可磨灭的功绩。但直到现在，胡麻在人们的心目中仍然未取得其应有的地位。
    胡麻的真实情况是怎样呢？人们对胡麻的指责是不公正的。胡麻不但不是低产作物，而且一身都是宝。去年甘肃酒泉县创造了亩产五百六十斤的高产纪录，这个事实说明胡麻不是低产作物。胡麻的出油率在油料作物中除芝麻、油菜以外是最高的，达32％—37％；胡麻还可以产出大量纤维、麻骨和衣子等有用物，因为胡麻纤维的拉力、耐磨力和耐水力比棉花强，用途极广，能纺成各种衣料、帆布、吭布，能作汽车轮胎衬线。天津、无锡等地用胡麻纤维与棉花混纺，织成双面卡叽、斜纹布和各种花布二十多种，深受消费者欢迎。这个事实可以说明胡麻一身都是宝。
    是胡麻扬眉吐气的时候了，应该给胡麻以应得的地位。
