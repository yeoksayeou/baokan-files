Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th - The French Women's Union issued a call to French women after a meeting of its National Council on the 28th, calling on women across the country to uphold the republican system and oppose personal dictatorship in the upcoming referendum.

The call said that De Gaulle has decided to give France a constitution drafted by him. Although the detailed content of the constitution is still unknown to the country, people cannot help but think that this constitution will give one person full power.

The call also urged women across the country to continue to take action to safeguard the social benefits they have already won and to strive to improve family living conditions.
