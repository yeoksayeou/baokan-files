    Exceeding "Zhen Mei," Surpassing "Longjing"
    A "Qifeng" (Rare Peak) Emerges in Green Tea
    Wuyuan County, Jiangxi Province, the famous "Wu Green" tea region, has produced a uniquely styled green tea this year, hailed as a treasure among teas. This green tea is named "Qifeng," with delicate buds and abundant fuzz, bright tea leaves, an exceptionally emerald green color, and a consistently clear and pleasing liquor after brewing, with a fresh and rich aroma. After evaluation and assessment by tea production and export departments, it was unanimously agreed that its quality surpasses the best-selling "Zhen Mei" and the top-grade "Longjing" for domestic sales.
    This tea was picked before "Qingming" (Tomb Sweeping Day), with a total yield of just over 300 jin (approximately 150 kg). Wuyuan is mountainous and cold, and traditionally, tea picking starts at "Lixia" (Start of Summer), or at least "Guyu" (Grain Rain). This year, in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, thanks to good tea tree cultivation work, tea trees sprouted earlier than usual. Ten days before "Qingming," when the tender leaves first unfolded, tea farmers picked the first batch of new tea, all one bud and one leaf. During the initial processing, refined selection and allocation were carried out according to the characteristics of tea from different producing areas, hence producing such good tea.

    超“珍眉”　跨“龙井”
    绿茶出现“奇峰”
    著名“婺绿”茶区江西婺源县，今年出产了一种独创一格的绿茶，被誉为茶叶珍品。这种绿茶取名“奇峰”，细嫩多毫，叶底明亮，色泽异常翠绿，浸泡之后，汤色始终清澈悦目，香气鲜浓。经过茶叶生产和出口部门的审评鉴定，一致认为它的品质超过了目前外销最好的上级“珍眉”和内销的特级“龙井”。
    这种茶叶是在“清明”前采摘的，总产量三百多斤。婺源山高气冷，历来习惯是“立夏”开始采茶，早的也要到“谷雨”。今年在生产大跃进的高潮中，由于茶树抚育工作做得好，茶树发芽普遍提早，“清明”前十天嫩叶初展时，茶农便采摘第一批新茶，全部一芽一叶；初制过程中，又根据不同产地茶叶的特点进行了精级的选配，因此，制出这样好的茶叶。　（新华社）
