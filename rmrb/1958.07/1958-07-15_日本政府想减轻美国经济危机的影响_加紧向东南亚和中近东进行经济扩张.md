Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 14th: The Japanese Foreign Ministry, under the Kishida Nobusuke government, recently convened a meeting of Japanese ambassadors stationed in the Soviet Union, the United States, West Germany, the United Arab Republic, and Thailand, which focused on discussing how to alleviate Japan's economic crisis and carry out economic expansion.

The main measures proposed at these meetings were: to change the trade deficit with the United States, which was caused by excessive dependence on the United States for raw material imports and US restrictions on Japanese goods imports; to intensify economic expansion into Southeast Asia and the Middle East; and to open up African markets. This indicates that, under the shadow of the economic crisis, the Kishida Nobusuke government fears that the increasingly deteriorating Japanese economy will be further affected by the US economic crisis and attempts to shift some of its raw material imports from the United States to Southeast Asia. At the same time, it takes advantage of the sharp drop in raw material prices and the economic construction needs of Asian and African countries to massively invade the Asian and African regions.

However, can the Kishida Nobusuke government's wishful thinking be realized? The answer will be no.

The current economic crisis in Japan is the most serious since the war. From an international perspective, in a situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, Japan's dream of reliving the Korean War to solve the first interim crisis after the war in 1950 is bound to fail. Currently, the economies of all capitalist countries are either falling into crisis or facing crisis, and it is even more unimaginable for Japan to obtain the favorable international export conditions it had before 1956. From a domestic perspective, the average operating rate of the entire industrial sector has been reduced by more than 30%. Since the Korean War in 1950 until the end of 1957, Japan has invested approximately eight billion US dollars in updating production equipment, etc., resulting in the current serious overproduction. It is no longer possible to alleviate the crisis by increasing equipment investment. That is to say, the Japanese economy is facing a dead end.

In view of the severity of this economic crisis, the Japanese monopoly capital groups and the Kishida Nobusuke government, while continuing to beg the United States to relax its restrictions on Japanese goods, have begun to consider changing their economic dependence on the United States to some extent to reduce the harm of the US crisis to them. Because Japan's main raw materials mostly rely on imports from the United States, Japan's trade deficit with the United States is staggering. Taking 1957 as an example, Japan's trade deficit with the United States reached 1 billion US dollars, accounting for more than two-thirds of Japan's total trade deficit in the same year. This year, due to the United States stepping up restrictions on imports of Japanese goods, if imports of raw materials from the United States are not reduced, Japan's trade deficit with the United States will increase even more, which will be even more unfavorable for Japan to alleviate its economic crisis. According to Japanese press statistics, if raw materials such as ore, soybeans, coke, cotton, oil, wheat, and barley, which have always been imported from the United States, can be replaced by imports from Asia, Japan can reduce its trade deficit with the United States by at least 500 to 600 million US dollars annually.

By 1957, Japan's industrial and mining production index had increased by more than one and a half times compared with before the war, but its exports were only 94.5% of the pre-war level. In the current situation where the capitalist world market is shrinking, it is even more difficult for Japan to expand exports to extricate itself from the crisis. In the first three months of this year, Japan's exports to the Southeast Asian market, which occupies an important position in its exports, amounted to 229.6 million US dollars, a decrease of more than 11% compared with the same period last year, which proves this point.

As for the Middle East and African markets, because Western capitalist countries have a traditional monopoly position here, and competition is very fierce, the prospect of Japan squeezing in is also dim.

In order to adapt to the lack of foreign exchange in Asian countries, the Kishida Nobusuke government attempts to expand the Asian and African markets by means of capital exports such as credit loans and deferred payment exports. However, Asian countries still have fresh memories of Japanese imperialism's aggression during World War II, and they are gradually recognizing the potential imperialist ambitions of the current Kishida Nobusuke government. They will not fail to be vigilant against this expansionist conspiracy of the Kishida Nobusuke government.

### 日本政府想减轻美国经济危机的影响  加紧向东南亚和中近东进行经济扩张

    日本政府想减轻美国经济危机的影响
    加紧向东南亚和中近东进行经济扩张
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府的外务省最近召开的日本驻苏联、美国、西德、阿拉伯联合共和国和泰国的大使会议，曾经集中讨论如何解脱日本经济危机和进行经济扩张的问题。
    在这些会议上提出的主要办法是：改变由于进口原料过多地依附美国和美国限制日货进口而造成的对美贸易入超情况；加紧向东南亚和中近东进行经济扩张；开辟非洲市场。这表明，在经济危机笼罩下，岸信介政府担心日益恶化的日本经济进一步受到美国经济危机的影响，企图把一部分原料的输入从美国转向东南亚，同时乘原料价格猛跌和亚非国家经济建设上的需要，大举侵入亚非地区。
    但是，岸信介政府的这种如意算盘能够兑现吗？回答将是否定的。
    目前日本的经济危机是战后最严重的一次。从国际环境来看，在东风压倒西风的形势下，日本想要重温用朝鲜战争来解决1950年的战后第一次中间性危机的美梦，势必落空；目前整个资本主义国家的经济都在陷入危机或者面临危机，日本想要得到1956年以前那样有利的国际输出条件，更是不可想像。从国内环境来看，整个产业部门的开工率平均已降低30％以上，日本从1950年朝鲜战争以来到1957年末，在更新生产设备等方面已经投资约计八十亿美元，造成目前严重的生产过剩，再想用增加设备投资来缓和危机已经不可能了。这就是说，日本的经济面临着走投无路的局面。
    鉴于这次经济危机的严重性，日本垄断资本集团和岸信介政府在继续乞求美国放宽对日本货物的抵制的同时，已经开始考虑在某种程度上改变一下对美国的经济依赖，减轻美国危机对它的危害。由于日本的主要原料大部分依靠从美国进口，日本的对美贸易入超数额惊人，以1957年为例，日本对美入超达十亿美元，占日本同年全部入超的三分之二以上。今年，由于美国加紧限制日本商品进口，如果不减少从美国的原料进口，日本的对美入超将更加增大，更不利于日本缓和它的经济危机。据日本报刊统计，如果能把一向从美国输入的矿石、大豆、焦炭、棉花、石油、小麦和大麦等原料改由亚洲进口，日本每年至少可以减少对美入超五、六亿美元。
    到1957年，日本的工矿业生产指数虽然已经比战前增长了一倍半以上，但是它的输出却仅及战前的94.5％。在目前资本主义世界市场日益缩小的情况下，日本想要扩大输出来解脱危机，更是困难重重。今年头三个月，日本对在它的输出中占重要地位的东南亚市场的输出额为二亿二千九百六十万美元，比去年同一时期减少了11％以上，证明了这一点。
    至于中近东和非洲市场，由于西方资本主义国家在这里有传统的垄断地位，并且竞争非常剧烈，日本来挤进去的前景也很暗淡。
    岸信介政府为了适应亚洲国家缺乏外汇的情况，企图用信用贷款、延期付款输出等资本输出的办法来扩大亚非市场。但是，亚洲国家对第二次世界大战中日本帝国主义的侵略记忆犹新，对目前的岸信介政府的潜在的帝国主义野心逐渐识破，它们不会不警惕岸信介政府的这种扩张阴谋。
