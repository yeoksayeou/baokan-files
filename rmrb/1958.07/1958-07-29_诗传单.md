Poetry Leaflet

　　See which smashed American imperialism is tofu, we are the iron hammer. Tofu meets iron hammer, see which shatters!
　　　　(Zhao Jianchang, Miner, Tangshan Tangjiazhuang Mine)

　　Stop! Yesterday in the fields we sang folk songs, singing of the sun, moon, and stars shifting, suddenly hearing of the Middle East war erupting, we changed the tune to sing war songs. Yesterday we carried away four mountains, this morning we just moved the river course, if the US and UK don't get out, a shovel will throw you into the Nile!
　　　　(Liu Wenyu, Shenyang)

　　Traitors Meet the King of Hell
　　A gust of east wind blows through West Asia: the Faisal dynasty surrendered their guns, the prime minister fled with nowhere to hide, dressed as a woman, losing all dignity, the insurgent vanguard cleverly blocked the path, the traitors went to meet the King of Hell!
　　　　(Wei Mingren, Henan)

　　Yesterday · Today
　　Yesterday, drops of fresh blood, the tears of children and mothers, were forged into blocks of gold, fattening the butchers of New York and London.
　　Today, the Mediterranean Sea stirred up towering waves, hundreds of thousands of white bones accused along the coast, they no longer wept, but raised their iron fists high.
　　　　(Chaoyang, Tianjin)

    诗传单
    看看哪个碎美帝是豆腐，我们是铁锤。豆腐碰铁锤，看看哪个碎！
  （唐山唐家庄矿工　赵建昌）
    住　手！昨天田里唱民歌，唱的日月星斗挪，忽听中东战火起，换了调子唱战歌。昨天挑走四座山，今早刚把河道挪，美英如不滚出去，一锹扔你到尼罗河！
          （沈阳　刘文玉）
  卖国贼见阎王西亚一阵东风响：费萨尔王朝缴了枪，首相逃跑无处躲，男扮女装丢人像，起义尖兵巧堵上，卖国贼去见阎王！
        （河南　魏明仁）
  昨天·今天昨天，一滴滴的鲜血，孩子和母亲的眼泪，铸成了一块块的金圆，养肥了纽约和伦敦的屠户。今天，地中海掀起了滔天的大波，成千成万的白骨在沿岸控诉，他们不再哭啼，而是高高举起铁的拳头。
          （天津　朝阳）
