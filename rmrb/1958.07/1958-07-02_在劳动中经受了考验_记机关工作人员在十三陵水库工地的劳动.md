    Tested in Labor
    ——A Record of the Labor of Office Workers at the Ming Tombs Reservoir Construction Site
   Ren Min, Fang Zuhao
    At the Ming Tombs construction site, there is a voluntary labor force of office workers, regularly maintained at over 7,000 people. They persevered from the start of the reservoir project to its final victory.
    This force is composed of staff from central government agencies and Beijing municipal agencies. More than 86,000 people have participated in this labor force at various times. The members of the force range from the Premier and ministers to service personnel and cleaners. Among them are Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, members of various democratic parties; people of Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Korean, Kazakh, Uygur and other ethnic groups; senior intellectuals such as professors, researchers, chief engineers, writers, poets, editors, translators, and directors, and actors; and veteran cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds who have endured long revolutionary struggles. In addition, international friends from socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, North Korea, Vietnam, and East Germany, and from countries such as Burma, Japan, Cambodia, and the United Kingdom have also participated in the voluntary labor force of government offices.
    In five months of intense labor, the massive force of office workers overcame the severe cold of minus twenty degrees and the heat of thirty-eight degrees, overcoming various difficulties with the determination and action that "no matter how great the wind and sand, it is not greater than our determination; no matter how hard the stone, it is not harder than our will; no matter how many the difficulties, it is not more than our solutions." In order to rush the construction of the west dam highway as a gift to "July 1st," the labor heroes of units such as the Ministry of Building Construction worked continuously for three days, from morning to night under a cloudless, scorching sun, working hard for fourteen to seventeen hours each day. In the labor, many model figures emerged in various agencies, such as Wang Dianqi, a cadre from the First Ministry of Machine Building, known as the "Iron Arm Hero," and Shan Rongfu, the "Shoulder Basket Hero," who carried five or six baskets at a time, carrying more than 140 loads a day; the old worker Sha Qingyun, known as "Old Hero," who carried ten baskets at a time with swift strides; Qin Zhifan, a mother of five, carried 1,209 loads of sand in nine days; in the labor force of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, there was a 62-year-old woman who took advantage of her daughter being in the hospital after giving birth to stubbornly follow the team to the construction site to work. Xue Yunshan, from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, whose legs were disabled and had difficulty walking, insisted on coming despite being told not to; unable to shovel soil while standing, he shoveled on his knees, persisting to the end. Wang Naixian and Su Keyi of the directly affiliated organs of the CPC Central Committee continued to work despite running a fever of 38 degrees, overcoming their illness. Many people fainted from the heat, but got up and continued to work.
    Among the massive labor force of office workers, about 70% of the members lacked experience in physical labor, and for many, participating in such heavy physical labor was unprecedented. At the beginning of the labor, some people could not carry half a basket, could not shovel hard soil, could not push a wheelbarrow steadily, and could not lift stones, but they had a common belief: "Clench your teeth and persevere, and victory will be ours." They said, "It doesn't matter if a blister forms on your foot, as long as your mind doesn't blister, you can keep going"; some comrades from the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power said: "Yesterday I carried a level basket, and a big bump formed, today I carried a heaped basket, and flattened the bump." They thus optimistically endured the labor training, allowing blood blisters to harden into calluses and swelling injuries to be tempered into muscles.
    Office workers not only used their labor but also contributed their technology and knowledge to support the construction of the reservoir. In the labor, they also spontaneously launched a rationalization proposal movement in which everyone contributed ideas and suggestions. In order to meet this desire, the office headquarters invited more than 30 engineers working on site to hold a three-day "Zhuge Liang Meeting," contributing a total of 451 proposals. These suggestions were valued by the general headquarters, and many important improvements were made to construction measures based on the construction conditions. The shift of office workers from mental labor to physical labor was a huge revolution. Through the practical exercise of collective labor, those cadres of the so-called "three doors" (from home to school to office) initially recognized the necessity and path of linking theory with practice through labor. Ye Guangyi, a teacher at the Light Industry Cadre School, said: "I have taught physics for several years, and I often talk about the center of gravity. But today I got on a bulldozer, but I couldn't grasp the center of gravity. In the end, I found the law of the center of gravity in the constant overturning, so empty talk is not enough." Zhao Xiaoyi, who was engaged in water conservancy and architectural design, said: "In the past, when designing, the safety factor of the reservoir was too large, easily adding 20% to the flood, without considering that this would increase the elevation of the dam, increase the amount of earthwork, and cause a waste of labor." They tasted the flavor of labor, felt the arduousness of labor, realized that "physical labor is not simple, it is more difficult and more complex than our design work"; at the same time, they also tasted the joy of labor, cherished the results of labor, and felt the necessity of establishing feelings for the working people. A female comrade said at a heart-to-heart meeting: "Through labor, I solved a problem. My lover is a worker. In the past, I thought he only sold his strength and was not promising. Now I realize that the strength of workers and peasants is great. Without them, the reservoir could not be built." Liu Xiuqin, a health worker at the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, was always uneasy about her work and looked down on physical labor. After this labor, she returned to her original unit, and her work attitude has greatly changed. Many comrades believe that "this is an ideological perspective," and the remnants of exploitative thinking, such as "all occupations are inferior, only studying is superior," appeared even more humble and sordid under the "ideological perspective." They said, "Although the working people are dirty, and their clothes are dirty, their thoughts are not dirty."

    在劳动中经受了考验
    ——记机关工作人员在十三陵水库工地的劳动
   任民　方祖浩
    在十三陵工地上有一支经常保持着七千余人的机关工作人员义务劳动队伍。他们从水库工程动工开始一直坚持到最后胜利。
    这支队伍是由中央各机关和北京市级各机关的工作人员组成的。先后有八万六千多人参加了这个劳动队伍。队伍的成员上自总理，部长直到服务员和清洁员。其中有共产党员、共青团员、各民主党派人士；有汉、满、蒙、回、藏、朝鲜、哈萨克、维吾尔等各民族；有教授、研究员、总工程师、作家、诗人、编辑、翻译、导演、演员等高级知识分子；也有久经革命战斗，饱受风霜的工农老干部。此外，参加机关义务劳动队伍的，还有苏联、朝鲜、越南、民主德国等社会主义国家和缅甸、日本、柬埔寨、英国等国际友人。
    机关劳动大军在这五个月的紧张劳动中，战胜了零下二十度的严寒，战胜了三十八度的炎热，以“风砂再大，没有我们的决心大，石头再硬，没有我们的意志坚，困难再多，没有我们的办法多”的决心和行动克服了各种困难。为了赶修坝西公路，向“七一”献礼，中央建筑工程部等单位的劳动英雄们，一连三天，在万里无云，烈日当空的情况下从早晨到黑夜一班干到底，每天硬攻猛干达十四个到十七个小时。在劳动中各机关都出现了不少的模范人物，如第一机械工业部的干部，号称“铁臂英雄”的王殿起，“肩筐英雄”的单荣福，他们一挑就是五六筐；日挑一百四十余担；人称“老英豪”的老工人沙庆云，一挑十筐，健步如飞；已是五个孩子的妈妈的秦芝藩，九天中挑砂一千二百零九担；北京市人民委员会的劳动队伍中有个六十二岁的老太太，趁她女儿生小孩住医院的机会，也硬跟着队伍来工地劳动。冶金部有个两腿残废行走不便的薛云山，不让来硬要来，站着不能铲土，就跪着铲，一直坚持到底。中共中央直属机关的王乃贤、苏克义，发烧到三十八度仍坚持了劳动，战胜了病魔。很多人因为气候炎热，晕倒在地爬起再干。
    在机关劳动大军中，约有70％的成员缺乏体力劳动的经验，很多人对于参加这种繁重体力劳动还是破天荒第一遭。劳动之初，有些人挑不了半筐，铲不了硬土，推不稳小车，搬不起石头，但是他们有一个共同的信念，这就是“咬紧牙关，坚持下去就是胜利”。他们说“脚上起个泡不要紧，只要思想不起泡就能干下去”；水电部有的同志说：“昨天挑平筐，起了个大疙瘩，今天挑尖筐，压平了疙瘩。”他们就是这样乐观地经受着劳动锻炼。让血泡结成了老茧，肿伤磨炼成筋肉。
    机关工作人员不但用自己的劳动而且贡献了自己的技术与知识支援了水库的建设。在劳动中还自发地开展了人人献策献计的合理化建议运动。机关指挥部为了满足这一意愿，曾邀请了在劳动的三十多位工程师开了三天“诸葛亮会”，共献策四百五十一条，这些建议都受到了总指挥部的重视，根据施工条件，作了很多重要施工措施上的改进。机关工作人员从脑力劳动到参加体力劳动，这是一个巨大的革命。通过集体劳动的实际锻炼，使那些所谓“三门”（从家门到校门又到机关门）的干部初步认识到通过劳动联系实际的必要和门径。轻工业部干校的一位教员叶广益说：“我教了几年物理，经常谈重心问题。但是今天我架上了推土车，却掌握不住重心。最后还是在不断的翻车中找到了重心的规律，所以空谈理论是不行的。”搞水利建筑设计的赵笑一说：“过去设计时，水库安全系数过大，轻易地按照洪水加20％，而没有考虑到这会使坝的高程增加，土方增多，造成劳动力上的浪费。”他们尝到了劳动的滋味，感到了劳动的艰巨，认识到“体力劳动并不简单，比我们搞设计工作要艰苦得多复杂得多”；同时也尝到劳动的愉快，珍视劳动的成果，感到了树立劳动人民感情的必要。有一位女同志在交心会上说：“通过劳动解决了一个问题，我的爱人是工人，过去认为他光卖力气没出息，现在认识到工人农民的力量是伟大的了，没有他们水库就修不起来。”中医院卫生员刘秀琴一向不安心自己的工作，看不起体力劳动，这次劳动后回到了原单位，工作态度有了很大的变化。许多同志认为：“这是受到了一次思想透视”，所谓“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的剥削残余思想，在“思想透视”下，显得更加卑微龌龊。他们说：“劳动人民虽然身上脏，衣服脏，可是思想不脏。”
