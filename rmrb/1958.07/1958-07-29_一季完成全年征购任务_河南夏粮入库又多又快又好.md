Xinhua News Agency report:

    Having achieved a great wheat harvest, the broad masses of farmers in Henan Province have, in an extremely short period, overfulfilled the entire year's grain procurement task in a single season. This is unprecedented in Henan's grain work.
    As of the statistics of July 20th, the amount of summer grain stored throughout the province reached 5,135,000,000 jin, an increase of nearly three times the amount stored in the same period last year. The quality of the grain stored is better than in any previous year. According to investigations in eight counties, three townships, and one agricultural cooperative, the stored grain consists of 36.3% top-grade, 43.9% medium-grade, and 18.2% third-grade, basically eliminating substandard, out-of-grade grain.
    Educated by the General Line of Socialist Construction, the farmers of Henan Province deeply understand that this year's great summer grain harvest is the result of the Party and government leading everyone in a Great Leap Forward. Coupled with the展開 of the struggle between the two roads on the grain front, a vigorous upsurge of handing over public grain and selling surplus grain quickly swept the province. Short time, large procurement, fast storage, and good quality are the characteristics of Henan's summer grain procurement and storage work this year. During the summer grain procurement and storage, the masses were in high spirits, full of vigor, and fully demonstrated the broad masses of farmers' high patriotic spirit and great communist spirit. Many agricultural cooperatives, in order to strive for early storage and quick entry into warehouses, put forward the battle slogan of "Treating night as day, working hard in a concentrated way, grain entering storage like a rocket," and organized massive grain delivery teams. While organizing storage work, various places closely combined it with the current urgent autumn field management work, ensuring that both storage and production were not neglected.
    Although Henan Province has already completed the entire year's grain procurement task in a single season, due to the unprecedented summer grain harvest, the proportion of procurement only accounts for 22.1% of the summer grain output, which is 1.8% lower than last year. Moreover, the surplus grain remaining in the countryside after procurement is very abundant, exceeding any year in history. After completing the procurement task and deducting maneuver grain, rations, increased production share grain, seeds, and feed, agricultural cooperatives still have tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of jin of reserve grain.

### 一季完成全年征购任务  河南夏粮入库又多又快又好

    一季完成全年征购任务
    河南夏粮入库又多又快又好
    据新华社讯　获得小麦大丰收的河南省广大农民，在极短时间内，一季超额完成了全年的粮食征购任务。这在河南省粮食工作中是史无前例的。
    到7月20日止的统计，全省夏粮入库已达五十一亿三千五百万斤，比去年同期入库数量增加将近三倍。入库粮食的质量比任何一年都好，根据八个县、三个乡和一个农业社的调查，已入库的粮食中，上等粮占36.3％，中等粮占43.9％，三等粮占18.2％，基本上消灭了不合规格的等外粮。
    河南省农民受到社会主义建设总路线的教育，深刻地认识到今年夏粮大丰收是党和政府领导大家大跃进的结果，加上在粮食战线上展开了两条道路的斗争，因而迅速地在全省掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的交公粮卖余粮的热潮。时间短、征购多、入库快、质量好，这是今年河南省夏粮征购入库工作的特点。夏粮征购入库中，群众情绪高昂，劲头十足，充分表现了广大农民高度的爱国主义精神和共产主义的伟大气魄。很多农业社为了争取早入库，快进仓，提出“黑夜当白天，大干突击干，粮食入库像火箭”的战斗口号，组织了千军万马的送粮队伍。各地在组织入库工作同时，还紧密结合了当前紧张的秋田管理工作，做到了入库、生产两不误。
    河南省虽然已经一季就完成了全年的粮食征购任务，但是由于夏粮空前丰收，征购的比例只占夏粮产量的22.1％，比去年要低1.8％，而且农村征购后余粮非常充足，超过了历史上任何一年。农业社在完成征购任务和扣除机动粮、口粮、增产多分粮、种子、饲料等之后，都还有几万斤甚至几十万斤的储备粮。
