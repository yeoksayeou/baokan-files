Two Kinds of Tension
Sun Xiaocun

Reading Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which refuted the idea that "increasing the speed of construction would make people 'too tense'," I felt it was very meaningful. Not to mention the distant past, but just since the founding of New China, in these nine years, which day were the members of the Chinese Communist Party, the working masses, and the working people not tense? The period of national economic recovery was certainly tense, and the period of the First Five-Year Plan was also tense; years with severe natural disasters were certainly tense, and even in years of good harvests, some areas inevitably suffered from disasters, so how could they not be tense.

In 1950 and 1951, I worked in the Central Finance and Economics Commission. I remember that Comrade Chen Yun, the director of the Central Finance and Economics Commission at that time, had to look at a chart every morning, which was made by the Ministry of Railways based on the rainfall along the various railway lines each day. Sometimes I saw Comrade Chen Yun's face light up with joy, and without asking, I knew that there had been a good rain in various places yesterday and the day before yesterday. Soon after the worrying spring drought season passed, the flood season came, which was an even more critical juncture related to the annual agricultural harvest, and it was necessary to pay close attention to the water conditions of the major rivers. The great spirit of the central leaders, who completely connected their thoughts, feelings, joys, sorrows, and happiness with the production and life of millions of people, was truly moving. But can we continue to live in this situation of relying on the heavens for food for a long time? No. Therefore, the Huai River began to be harnessed, the Guanting Reservoir was built, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project was also completed, and so on. For nine years, the Chinese Communist Party has led the Chinese people to work hard in this way, liberating themselves from "worried tension" with "pleasant tension."

That's right, we have not yet been able to completely change the "terrible tense situation" mentioned in the report, and many people inevitably have "worried tension"! Precisely because of this, we must speed up the pace of construction, and "hundreds of millions of people must be mobilized to devote themselves to enthusiastic labor and struggle with confidence." This is a pleasant tension, the purpose of which is to get rid of that worrying and passive situation. Recently, I listened to the report of Cui Xiyan, the director of the Yingju Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengqiu County, Henan Province. He said that when they were building water conservancy projects last winter, a young man had a crack in his arm due to frostbite, and a lot of blood was flowing. Director Cui advised him to stop working, but the young man resolutely refused, and said loudly: "I would rather bleed than be a disaster victim." This is the common voice of thousands of Chinese workers and peasants. They would rather work hard and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way than live a worried and backward life.

Hearing about faster, better, and more economical, and feeling that it would make people "too tense," is essentially a reflection of the ideology of the exploiting classes. Eating the food of exploitation, tea is served when you reach out, food is served when you open your mouth, and floods and droughts have nothing to do with you; or even though you have become a state worker, your mind is still dominated by bourgeois ideology. Anyway, you can receive a salary every month, and floods and droughts will not affect you, so you are indifferent to state affairs and people's lives. These two types of people have neither been worriedly tense for the country and the people, and of course they will not appreciate what a pleasant tension it is to labor and struggle enthusiastically under the brilliant light of the general line! Driven by the soaring enthusiasm of the working class and the working people across the country, there are fewer and fewer such people today, but we must remind them that if they do not become "pleasantly tense," the distance between themselves and new things and new phenomena will become greater and greater, and in the end they will inevitably taste the bitter fruit of personal "worried tension."

    两种紧张
    孙晓村
    读了刘少奇同志在中共八大二次会议上所作的工作报告中批驳“提高建设速度，会使人们‘过于紧张’”的一段话，感到意味深长。不谈远的，只说新中国成立以来，这九年中间，中国共产党党员、工人群众和劳动人民哪一天不紧张？国民经济恢复时期固然紧张，第一个五年计划建设时期又何尝不紧张；自然灾害严重的年份固然紧张，丰收的年份也免不了有些地区遭受灾害，又何尝不紧张。
    1950年、1951年我在中财委工作，记得当时中财委主任陈云同志每天早晨一定要看一张表，那就是由铁道部根据每天各路沿线下雨的情况制成的。有时我看陈云同志喜形于色，不问，就知道昨天、前天各地普降甘霖。令人担心的春旱季节过去后不久，汛期来到，那更是关系全年农业收成的紧要关头，必须密切注意着各大河流的水情。中央的负责同志这种把自己的思想感情、喜怒哀乐完全同千百万人民的生产与生活连结在一起的伟大精神，真使人感动。但我们能长期苟安于这种靠天吃饭的局面吗？不能。于是，淮河开始治理了，官厅水库修起来了，荆江分洪工程也搞成了，等等。九年以来，中国共产党就是这样领导中国人民奋勇劳动，以“愉快的紧张”把自己从“担心的紧张”中解放出来。
    不错，我们今天还没有能完全改变报告中所指出的“可怕的紧张局面”，许多人还免不了要有“担心的紧张”！正因为如此，所以我们一定要加快建设速度，要“几万万人鼓起干劲，满怀信心地投入热烈的劳动和斗争中”，这是愉快的紧张，目的是为了摆脱那种令人担心的被动的局面。最近听了河南封丘县应举农业生产合作社崔希彦社长的报告，他讲到去冬修水利时，有一位青年手臂上冻裂了一道口子，血流得不少，崔社长劝他停止工作，那青年坚决不肯，大声地说：“宁可流血，不做灾民。”这正是中国千千万万工人和农民的共同声音，他们宁愿紧张地劳动，多快好省地建设社会主义，不愿再过担心的、落后的日子。
    一听到多快好省，就感到会使人们“过于紧张”，实质上是剥削阶级思想的反映。吃剥削饭，茶来伸手，饭来张口，水旱灾荒，与己无关；或者虽然做了国家的工作人员，但脑子里还是资产阶级思想在挂帅，反正每月有工资可领，水灾旱灾临不到他的头上，因而对国家大事、人民生活漠不关心。这两类人，既没有为国家、为人民担心地紧张过，当然不会体会到在总路线的光辉照耀下，热烈地劳动和斗争是一种何等愉快的紧张！在全国工人阶级和劳动人民的冲天干劲的带动下，这种人今天是愈来愈少了，但要提醒他们，再不“愉快的紧张”起来，自己同新事物、新气象的距离会愈来愈大，最后就免不了要尝到个人的“担心的紧张”的苦果了。
