Miracles Emerge from Rapid Construction

Shanghai Builds a Seamless Steel Tube Workshop Plant in Three Days

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 20th. A miracle has occurred at the Shanghai Steel Tube Factory construction site of the Shanghai First Construction Engineering Company: Construction workers built a seamless steel tube workshop plant with an area of 1,728 square meters in just three days, using 486 man-days.

The seamless steel tube workshop plant was originally planned to be built in two months. Recently, the construction workers studied the General Line and heard that Shanghai's steel production was to increase from 500,000 tons last year to 1.2 million tons this year. They were determined to create a miracle of high-speed construction. At first, some workers doubted when they heard that the construction period was compressed from two months to three or five days, believing that it was impossible to build such a large plant in such a short time, even with paper. However, the majority opposed the above opinions, and in the end, they unanimously agreed to rush to complete this project in three days.

High-speed construction began at 5 a.m. on the 15th. In order to strengthen the assault force, the company transferred a group of excellent bricklayers, carpenters, assault teams, and assault groups from other construction sites. At the beginning, the mortar drying speed could not keep up with the construction progress. The workers came up with methods such as increasing the cement content and appropriately reducing the amount of water poured on the bricks to make the mortar dry faster and keep up with the construction speed. Forty-two bricklayers completed all the brick walls and column heads in the entire workshop in one day. Due to the lack of lifting equipment for installing purlins, the workers came up with methods such as lifting with scaffolding and pulling with chain hoists, and installed 460 purlins weighing two to three hundred pounds onto the roof trusses in one day. At the same time, they broke with the conventional practices of first building access roads around the site before construction and not disrupting piecework, and finally, they successfully built the seamless steel tube workshop plant in just three days using 486 man-days.

### 上海三天建成一座无缝钢管车间厂房

    快速施工出奇迹
    上海三天建成一座无缝钢管车间厂房
    据新华社上海20日电  上海市第一建筑工程公司的上海钢管厂工地上出现了一个奇迹：工地职工只用三天时间，四百八十六个人工，建成了一座面积一千七百二十八平方公尺的无缝钢管车间厂房。
    无缝钢管车间厂房本来打算用两个月时间建成。最近，工地上的职工学习了总路线，听到了上海钢的产量要从去年五十万吨增加到今年一百二十万吨，他们决心创造高速度施工的奇迹。开始时，有的职工听到施工期限从两个月压缩到三天、五天就怀疑，认为这样短的时间内建筑这样大的厂房，就是用纸糊也糊不出来。但是多数人反对以上的意见，最后他们一致同意要在三天内把这项工程赶出来。
    高速度施工是在15日早上五点开始的。为了加强突击力量，公司从其他工地上调来了一批优秀的泥工、木工突击队和突击组。开头，灰浆干燥速度跟不上施工进度，职工们想出用增加水泥成分、适当减少砖上浇水等办法，使灰浆快干，跟上建筑速度。四十二个泥工在一天内就砌成了全车间所有的砖墙和柱头。安装衍条缺少起重设备，工人们想出用脚手架抬、活络葫芦拉等办法，在一天时间内把四百六十根重二、三百斤的衍条装上了屋架。同时，他们打破了施工前场地周围要先做好便道以及计件工作不能打乱等常规，终于只花三天时间，用四百八十六个人工把这一个无缝钢管车间的厂房建筑成功。
