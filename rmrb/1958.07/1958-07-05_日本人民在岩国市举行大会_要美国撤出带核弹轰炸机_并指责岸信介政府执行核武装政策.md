Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 4th: The people of Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, held a rally in Iwakuni City on July 1st, demanding that the United States immediately withdraw bombers carrying atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs from the Iwakuni Air Base.

The rally passed a resolution demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government urge the US military authorities to immediately withdraw the aforementioned bombers. It also demanded that the United States and Britain halt nuclear tests and opposed turning Okinawa into a missile base. The resolution also accused the Kishi Nobusuke government of pursuing a policy of nuclear armament and lodged a strong protest against this policy.

The rally was jointly held by eleven organizations, including the Yamaguchi Prefecture Council of Trade Unions, the Yamaguchi Prefecture Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and the Iwakuni City Association of Atomic Bomb Victims. More than 700 residents of Iwakuni City and trade union and student representatives from Yamaguchi, Tokuyama, and other cities participated in the rally. Representatives of various groups unanimously pointed out at the rally that the fact that American bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons are flying over the heads of local residents is a major issue concerning the fate of the Japanese nation. They also pointed out that this action by the United States is inseparable from the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of arming Japan with nuclear weapons.

According to a report in today's "Akahata," the US Air Force has transported "Skyhawk A4D" and "Skywarrior A3D" bombers into Iwakuni Air Base, both of which are capable of carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs. The newspaper said that a US military unit trained in nuclear weapons operations has also arrived at Iwakuni Air Base. It is reported that a group of workers was sent from the United States two months ago and they are building bomb depots at Iwakuni Air Base. Residents of Iwakuni City suspect that this warehouse is used to store atomic and hydrogen bombs.

Prior to this, "Akahata" recently reported that the Japanese and American reactionaries are stepping up their military strength in Hokkaido, targeting the Soviet Union. Hokkaido is now equipped with more than 55,000 "Self-Defense Forces" personnel. The US military at Chitose Air Base in Hokkaido was scheduled to complete its withdrawal by the end of June, but recently it was decided to station two battalions of an unidentified branch of the US Army at Chitose Base. Residents of Chitose Town are very uneasy about these US troops of unknown composition.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 4th: One thousand residents of Niijima, one of the Izu Islands outside Tokyo Bay, passed a resolution at a rally held on July 2nd, opposing the construction of a missile test site on Niijima by the Japanese Defense Agency.

The resolution firmly stated that the residents of Niijima will launch a long-term struggle to oppose the construction of a missile test site on Niijima and oppose atomic war in order to protect their land, fishing grounds, and maintain their family lives.

    日本人民在岩国市举行大会
    要美国撤出带核弹轰炸机
    并指责岸信介政府执行核武装政策
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本山口县人民7月1日在岩国市举行大会，要求美国立即从岩国空军基地撤出携带原子弹和氢弹的轰炸机。
    大会通过决议，要求岸信介政府促使美军当局立即撤出上述轰炸机；同时，要求美英两国停止核试验，并且反对把冲绳变成导弹基地。决议还指责岸信介政府实行核武装的政策，并且对它的这种政策提出严重抗议。
    这次大会是由山口县工会评议会、山口县禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会和岩国市原子弹受害者协会等十一个团体联合举行的。参加大会的有岩国市居民和来自山口、德山等市的工会和学生代表七百多人。各团体代表在大会上一致指出，现在能够携带核武器的美国轰炸机正在当地居民的头上飞翔，这是有关日本民族命运的重大问题。他们还指出，美国这种举动是同岸信介政府执行的用核武器武装日本的政策分不开的。
    据“赤旗报”今天报道，美国空军已经把“空中之鹰A4D”式和“空中战士A3D”式轰炸机运进岩国空军基地，这两种轰炸机都能够携带原子弹和氢弹。这家报纸说，同时还有一支受过核武器操作训练的美军部队也随着开到岩国空军基地。据报道，在两个月以前还从美国派来一批工人，他们正在岩国空军基地从事建设炸弹仓库。岩国市居民都在怀疑这个仓库是用来储存原子弹和氢弹的。
    在这以前，“赤旗报”最近曾经报道，日美反动派针对着苏联，加紧在北海道加强军事力量。现在北海道配备有“自卫队”五万五千人以上，北海道千岁空军基地的美军规定在6月底全部撤退完毕，但是最近又决定把兵种不明的美国陆军两个营进驻千岁基地。千岁町居民对于这类兵种不明的美军感到非常不安。
    据新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本东京湾外伊豆群岛中的新岛居民一千人在7月2日举行的奋起大会上，通过决议反对日本防卫厅在新岛建设导弹试射场。
    决议坚决表示，新岛居民为了保卫土地、渔场、维持家庭生活，将展开长期斗争反对在新岛建设导弹试射场和反对原子战争。
