All-Rounders – The Beginning of Occupational Diversification
By our reporter Fu Dong

    We walked through a dense forest of scaffolding and climbed to the fourth floor, hoping to talk to Zhang Baifa. But he was extremely busy, speaking a few words to this steelworker, then giving some instructions to that concrete worker; he really couldn't spare the time to talk to us.

    Comrades on the construction site said that Zhang Baifa is now not only the leader of the youth shock brigade, but also the deputy leader of a mixed contracting team composed of more than 300 people. He does physical labor and participates in management. "This is all thanks to learning multiple skills. If a person understands ten or so trades, they can offer ideas about anything they see. Whatever happens on the construction site can be resolved immediately. And the people? They know many skills, so they can go wherever they are needed. The organization is constantly changing, so they are never idle throughout the year. You help me, I help you, and there are no more quarrels because you are waiting for me or I am waiting for you." That’s how the comrades on the construction site introduced him.

    After Zhang Baifa finished his official duties, he took us around to see various things. We went up and down the building, looked around for almost an entire afternoon, and finally saw all of their skills. They know so many things; besides tying steel bars, they have also learned how to operate hoists, mixers, pour concrete, do ironwork, apply lime soil, tie scaffolding, install plumbing and heating pipes, do sheet metal work, and they also know how to electric weld, gas weld, butt weld, and spot weld.

    He talked about their experience in learning multiple skills.

    The construction industry has many trades, but traditionally one person learns only one trade. This one trade has uneven workloads throughout the seasons, often busy for a while, then relaxed for a while. Like tying steel bars, at the beginning of spring, others are extremely busy, but they are leisurely. Around "May Day" and "National Day," others have nothing to do, but they are extremely busy, working more than ten hours a day. In winter, they can't find work. They receive twelve months' salary a year, but in reality, they only work six and a half months. Every day, after eating their fill, they just lie on the bed. After waking up, they go wandering around, or they take a bow and go hunting birds everywhere.

    What kind of behavior is this, taking money without working? They are still the leading class! Zhang Baifa couldn't stand it. When there was no work, he and some comrades voluntarily moved soil, pulled nails, chopped firewood, followed trucks, cooked... A lot of firewood was chopped, but in the end, after calculating, the firewood chopped wasn't even enough to pay one person's salary for a day! The public had to pay a lot of money. Everyone muttered together: "How can we get to socialism like this! Just picking up firewood takes away our time!"

    In 1954, the youth shock brigade was organized, which was good. The young lads in the team were as fierce as little tigers, full of energy, but sometimes other teams couldn't keep up and became impatient, so they often argued with others.

    In the spring of 1956, they were transferred to the film processing factory construction site. This factory used a lot of steel bars. The steel bars did come in large quantities, but they were of different lengths. Using manual joining, each end had to use a large section of material, costing more than three yuan. If electric welding was used, it would save money. "How great it would be if we knew how to do this!"

    He ran to the administration to ask for a welding machine, which arrived quickly. But they couldn't find anyone to teach them. He heard that the newly arrived Master Chen Deshui in the team knew a little. Master Chen had indeed done welding before, but that was when he was an apprentice more than ten years ago. He wasn’t even sure if he could still do it now, but seeing the task was so urgent, Master Chen agreed immediately and encouraged everyone: "I guarantee to teach you in three days." Everyone picked up a large pile of scrap steel bars to experiment with, and they were so happy that their hearts almost jumped out. The master instructed them not to look at the sparks with their naked eyes. How could they do that, they secretly looked. Good, by the next day, the eyes of seven people were swollen like walnuts, constantly shedding tears, and it hurt so much that they couldn't sleep. It took half a month to recover. Everyone wasn't discouraged and gathered their energy to start again. After three days, they really produced something and welded sixty bars. Everyone was so happy they almost jumped up, but after inspection, alas! Except for the twenty bars welded by Master Chen, the rest were unqualified, and the inside was completely hollow. The construction site was urging for goods, but who knew this would happen! But everyone didn't lose heart. After inspecting for a long time, they figured out that the problem was that the fire wasn't strong enough, and there was still air inside the joints. Once they found the root of the problem, it was easy to fix. From then on, everyone in the team could use electric welding. They calculated that this time alone saved the public thirty-eight tons of steel!

    Winter was coming, the weather was getting colder day by day, and they were worried again, about to be idle for another winter, eating a guilt-ridden meal for a whole winter, what to do? They inquired everywhere and heard that the materials supply station had a large batch of scrap iron to be processed outside. Leave it to them! Weren't the balcony railings of the building not yet made because there were no iron plates? Could this batch of scrap iron be made into iron plates? When it came to ironwork, Master Chen Deshui was really skilled. Master Chen was very supportive when he found out. Ironwork is hard work, and if it's bad, it can be melted down and re-forged, it just takes more work and won't damage any materials. Putting in the effort, the winter's results were good, forging more than 2,500 kilograms of iron, building the balcony, and also forging many trowels, spatulas, and more than 10,000 door and window fittings. They worked hard all winter, finished the work, and also learned how to swing a hammer and how to hold pliers. Half of the group went to learn how to fire boilers and install plumbing and heating pipes that winter, and they also studied and worked hard all winter.

    In April of this year, they arrived at the cold storage construction site. This building was unusual. It needed to store 9,000 tons of goods inside, and the foundation had to be very, very solid. There were many steel bars and a lot of concrete was poured. More than 170 concrete workers from the entire company were transferred, but it still wasn't enough. At that time, Zhang Baifa and his group had just worked hard for more than four days, getting up early and working late to tie the steel bars. When they heard that the concrete workers needed people, they rushed to go again. The leaders were afraid that they would be exhausted and didn't want them to go, but they couldn't persuade them, so they finally agreed, but they added five more people to them.

    After only working for one day, they heard a team member named Wang Baocai say: "We finally made it through this night." What kind of talk was that? Upon asking, they found out that two or three people also had this kind of emotion. No wonder, after working hard all day, the materials weren't supplied. They should debate this: "Is this 'making it through' striving for the upstream? What kind of drive is this?" At the meeting, everyone criticized Wang Baocai and praised Meng Zhaopeng, who never grumbled when he wasn't feeling well and always chose the heavy work to do. At the meeting, someone proposed: With too many people, you rely on me, I rely on you, and it delays things. It's better to transfer those five comrades back. Holding such a meeting really solved the problem. Afterwards, with fewer people, the work was completed ahead of schedule.

    They didn't study any theory, just learned and worked at the same time. Whatever was needed, they learned and did. Everyone learned ten kinds of skills, and the whole group became all-rounders. Now there were no idle people in the group, and everyone had work to do all year round. People came to them for help every day. People from the company came, and people from outside the company also came. (They also went to the railway construction engineering team and Mentougou and other places to teach people how to operate machines!) Everyone was willing to associate with them, and everyone elected them as models every month. In 1956, they won twelve red flags for outstanding performance. Everyone praised them for having collectivist ideas.

    Zhang Baifa said that the whole group is now all-rounders, but everyone is not proficient in everything. Recently, everyone discussed that they must learn to be complete all-rounders. For a building, a factory, from laying the foundation to building it, they must learn every kind of work. If they learn it, they can be transferred to any place in the future, and they can handle whatever building they are asked to build! We think that if every worker could learn a dozen skills, that would be amazing, then the speed of our country's construction would be many times faster than it is now!

    Now everyone is very enthusiastic about learning technology! These days we are working on改造 [remodeling] the hoist. The current hoist can't transport many things, sometimes it's even slower than us carrying it by hand, how can this be allowed? We must improve this machine. It's strange, after learning more than ten skills, everyone seems to be much smarter than before, and their brains are more flexible. They really came up with ways to change the machine. We also proposed to automate all steel bar work. Don't laugh at us, don't think we're daydreaming, we believe we can do it. These times, the newspapers have published many inventions and creations of workers, and those worker comrades are like us, they haven't studied much. If they can do it, why can't we? Of course, our educational level is a bit lower, we need to study harder.

    Zhang Baifa paused here. He looked at the buildings in the distance and said thoughtfully: "Sometimes, I think this: If everyone knows eighteen martial arts, both literary and martial arts, if they can write, they can operate machines, then there would be no distinction between mental and physical labor, you can do whatever you want. Wouldn't that be the arrival of communist society?"

    Zhang Baifa is right, now everyone is learning multiple skills, isn't that a start, isn't that the bud of communism!

    Let our young workers fly forward as soon as possible! Let us fly quickly with them! (Attached picture)

    多面手——职业多样化的开端
    本报记者  傅冬
    穿过密密层层的脚手架，爬到了四楼顶，想找张百发谈谈。可是他忙得要命，一会儿对这个钢筋工说几句，一会儿又给那个混凝土工讲几句，实在抽不出时间和我们谈话。
    工地上的同志说，张百发现在不光是青年突击队的队长，他还是一个三百多人组成的混合包工队的副队长。他又干体力活，又参加管理。“这都是学多种手艺的好处。一个人懂十来样活，看见什么也能出主意。工地上发生什么事，当下就解决了。大伙呢？会的样数多，那里忙就到那里去。组织常变，一年四季闲不着。你帮我、我帮你，再不因为你等我、我等你而吵架了。”工地上的同志这样介绍。
    张百发把公事办完，带我们去各处看了看。我们楼上楼下绕来绕去，看了差不多一个下午，才把他们的全部手艺看完。他们会的可多啦，除了扎钢筋，还学会了开卷扬机、搅拌机、打混凝土、打铁、打灰土、绑脚手架、安水暖管子、做白铁，还会电焊、汽焊、对焊、点焊。
    他谈了他们学多面手的经过。
    建筑这一行样数多，可是一向是一人学一样。这一样活，四季忙闲不均，常是紧一阵，松一阵。像扎钢筋，一开春，人家忙得一蹋糊涂，他们却悠哉闲哉。到“五一”“十一”这一段，别人没事了，他们却忙的不可开交，一天十几小时。到冬天，又找不到活干。一年领十二月的工资，实际上只干六个半月的活。每天，吃饱了饭，没事就往床上一躺。睡醒了到处去蹓跶，再不就拿着弓子到处去打鸟。
    这像什么话，光拿钱不作事。自己还是领导阶级呢！张百发看不过去，没活时，他就和一些同志主动地拢土、起钉子、劈劈柴、跟大车、做饭……。柴是劈了一大堆，到末了，一算计，劈的柴，还不够一个人一天的工资呢！公家还得倒贴很多钱。大家在一起嘀咕：“像这样子几时才能走到社会主义！光拣劈柴就把时间给拣去啦！”
    1954年组织了青年突击队，好是好，队里的年青小伙子一个个猛得像小老虎似的，冲劲大，可是别的队有时跟不上，不耐烦，这样就常常和人家争吵。
    1956年春天，调到影片洗印厂工地。这个厂的钢筋用的特别多。钢筋来倒是来的不少，但长短不齐，用人工接，每个头要多用一大截料，多费三块多钱。要是用电焊，省得多。“要是自己会这手，该多好！”
    他跑去找行政上要电焊机，马上就要到了。可是找不到人教。他听说队里新来的陈德水师傅，他会一点。陈师傅焊确实是焊过，但那是十几年前作学徒时的事了，现在能不能焊，连他自己心里也没数，但陈师傅见任务逼得那样紧，就一口答应了，还给大伙打气：“三天保管教会你们。”大伙拣了一大堆废钢筋试验，乐得心都快跳出来了。师傅嘱咐，不要用肉眼看火花。那怎行，偷偷地看。好，到第二天，七个人的眼睛，一个个肿得像核桃似的，直流眼泪，痛得睡都睡不着。别扭了半个月才好了。大伙不灰心，鼓起劲重来。前前后后干了三天，真出货了，焊了六十根。大伙高兴得几乎要跳起来，可是一检查，唉！除了陈师傅焊的二十根，其余的都不合格，心子里全是空的。工地上催着要货，那知又来了这一手！可是大伙没泄气，检查了半天，弄清楚毛病是催火的劲儿不大，接缝的地方里面还有空气。找到了毛病的根子，就好改了。打那以后，全队的人都会使电焊了。他们算了一下：光这一次，就给公家省了三十八吨钢筋！
    冬天要来了，天一天天凉了，他们又着急起来，又要闲一冬天，吃一冬天亏心饭，怎么办？四处一打听，听说，材料供应站有一大批废铁活要拿到外面去加工。留下它！楼房阳台栏杆不是因为没铁板还没做好吗？能不能把这一批废铁活打成铁板？说起打铁，陈德水师傅真在行。陈师傅知道了也挺支持。打铁是个力气活，这活计，坏了，大不了再烧化了重打，费点工就是了，不会毁坏什么材料。使了使劲，这一冬成绩不错，打了二千五百多公斤铁，盖好了阳台，还打了许许多多瓦刀、抹子和一万多个门窗配件。忙了一冬，活干完了，也学会了怎么抡锤，怎么拿钳。组里有一半人这年冬天去学烧锅炉、安水暖管子，他们也学了一冬，忙了一冬。
    今年4月，他们到了冷藏库工地。这楼可不寻常。里面要放九千吨的东西，基础要打的非常非常结实。放的钢筋多，打的混凝土也多。全公司一百七十多个混凝土工都调来了，还不够用。那时候，张百发一伙子刚刚起早贪黑忙了四天多把钢筋扎完，听说混凝土工要人，就又抢着要去。领导上怕把他们累垮了，不叫他们去，但又扭不过他们，最后只好答应了，不过给他们多加了五个人。
    才干了一天，就听见一个名叫王宝才的队员说：“这一宿总算熬出来了”，这是什么话？一问，才知道有二、三个人也有这种情绪。怪不得，忙了一天，供不上料。该辩一辩：“这种‘熬出来’的说法是不是力争上游？这叫什么干劲”？会上，大伙批评了王宝才，同时表扬了孟昭鹏，这同志身上不舒服，从不啃声，成天拣重活干。会上，有人提出：人多了，你靠我，我靠你，反倒把事情耽误了。不如把那五位同志仍调回去。开这样的会真解决问题，以后人少了，活倒反而提前完成了。
    他们没念什么理论，就这样边干边学，那里需要什么，就学什么，就干什么。人人都学会十种手艺，全组合起来成了全把式，现在组里再找不到闲人了，大伙一年四季有活干。成天有人来找他们帮忙。公司里的人来找，公司外的人也来找。（他们还到铁道建筑工程队和门头沟等地教人家开机器呢！）谁都愿意和他们来往，大伙月月选他们当模范，1956年这一年，他们得了十二次优胜红旗。大伙夸他们有集体主义思想。
    张百发说，我们全组现在是全把式，可是每个人还不是样样通，最近大伙讨论，一定要学个全把式，一座房子，一个工厂，从打基础到盖成，样样活都要学会。要是学会了，以后随便把我们调到什么地方，随便叫我们盖什么房子我们都拿得起来！我们想，如果每个工人都能会十几样手艺，那不得了，那我们国家的建设速度，不知要比现在快多少倍！
    现在大伙学技术的劲头可高啦！这几天我们正在琢磨改造卷扬机。现在的卷扬机运不了多少东西，有时比我们人扛运的还慢，这怎么行？我们一定要把这机器改造好。说也怪，学会了十多样手艺，大伙就像比以前聪明多了，脑子也灵活多了，真想出改机器的道道来了。我们还提出把钢筋活全部自动化。你别笑我们，别以为我们是白天说梦话，我们相信我们会办到的。这些时报上登了不少工人的发明创造，那些工人同志也和我们一样，没念过什么书。他们能办到，我们怎么不能办到？当然，我们的文化水平是少一些，我们要加紧学。
    张百发讲到这里停了停，他望着远处一幢幢的楼房，若有所思地说：“有时，我心里这样想：要是人人都会十八样武艺，文的、武的都能来，要写能写，要开机器能开机器，那时也不分什么脑力劳动和体力劳动，你想干什么，就可干什么。那不就到了共产主义社会了吗？”
    张百发说的不错，现在人人学多种手艺，可不就是开了个头，可不就是共产主义的萌芽！
    让我们的青年工人尽快地往前飞吧！让我们和他们一道快快地飞吧！（附图片）
