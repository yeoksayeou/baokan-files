Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 22nd: In the workshops of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, the sounds of machines cutting, cranes operating, and hammers forging large steel castings resonate throughout the day. Workers are busy rushing to produce heavy equipment such as rolling mills, large cranes, and gas generators.

In the Second Metalworking Workshop, section chief Bian Juyuan and technicians from the technical team are leading workers to rush-produce rolling mills. They changed the original six-step process of processing from rough castings through boring, planing, drilling, milling, gas cutting, and electric welding, adopting a joint three-dimensional cross-operation method, which shortened the time for manufacturing each set of rolling mills by two-thirds compared to the original plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 22nd: The Shanghai Turbine Factory is urgently producing one hundred and one medium-sized blast furnace blowers.

Blast furnace blowers are relatively complex and precise products urgently needed for the development of the iron and steel industry in various regions. This year, the blast furnace blowers produced by the Shanghai Turbine Factory will not only supply various parts of East China but also support iron and steel plants in Shijingshan, Ma'anshan, Chongqing, Baotou, and Daye.

The Shanghai Turbine Factory originally planned to produce eighteen medium-sized blast furnace blowers this year. Under the situation of the leaping development of the national iron and steel industry, all the factory's employees decided to expand the task of manufacturing medium-sized blast furnace blowers to catch up with the needs of the situation. To this end, the factory specifically established a blower workshop. This year, the factory's newly designed blower, which can blow 700 cubic meters per minute, is 40% lighter than similar products produced last year, and the production time can be shortened, with higher efficiency and lower cost.

    加速武装钢铁工业
    太原赶制轧钢机  上海增产鼓风机
    据新华社太原22日电  在太原重型机器厂的各个厂房里，机器切削声，吊车运行声和锻压大型铸钢件的锤击声，终日交响不已。职工们正在忙着赶制轧钢机、大型吊车和煤气发生炉等重型设备。
    在第二金工车间，工段长卞聚元和技术组的技师正在领导工人们赶制轧钢机。他们改变了从毛坯经过搪、刨、钻、铣、气割和电焊等逐一轮环操作的六道工序，采取了联合立体交叉作业的办法，使制造每套轧钢机的时间比原计划缩短了三分之二。
    据新华社上海22日电  上海汽轮机厂正在突击赶制一百零一台中型高炉鼓风机。
    高炉鼓风机是各地发展钢铁工业迫切需要的比较复杂、精密的产品。今年，上海汽轮机厂生产的高炉鼓风机，除了供应华东各地以外，还要支援石景山、马鞍山、重庆、包头、大冶等地钢铁厂。
    上海汽轮机厂今年原来计划生产十八台中型高炉鼓风机。在全国钢铁工业飞跃发展的形势下，全厂职工决定扩大制造中型高炉鼓风机的任务，赶上形势的需要。为此，工厂专门成立了鼓风机车间。今年，这个厂新设计的每分钟可鼓风七百立方米厘的鼓风机，比去年生产的相类似的产品重量降低了40％，生产时间可以缩短，效率高，成本低。
