    Farmers Learn Science: Daring to Think and Daring to Do

    Cotton Growing on Chinese Tree of Heaven
    Zhao Binghong, a 66-year-old member of the Shahutuo Agricultural Cooperative in the Yanta District of Xi'an City, experimented with grafting cotton onto Chinese Tree of Heaven using approach grafting and scion grafting.
    Zhao Binghong had previously tried grafting cotton onto Chinese Tree of Heaven, but it was a complete failure. Later, he used approach grafting and scion grafting methods on five trees, and three of them survived. Now, the three surviving cotton plants have grown to be more than four inches tall. To further expand the experimental results, Zhao Binghong recently grafted another five trees, four of which have begun to sprout.

    Rooster Incubates Chicks
    Since ancient times, hens have incubated chicks; who has ever seen a rooster incubate chicks? However, members of the Linji Village Agricultural Cooperative in Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, successfully experimented with having roosters incubate chicks. The experimental method is: castrate the rooster, get it drunk with two cups of wine, and while it is drunk, let the drunk rooster incubate the chicks. After three days, the rooster will not leave the eggs and can incubate the chicks until they hatch and nurture them to adulthood. A few roosters may refuse to incubate the eggs after they sober up, requiring two more cups of wine.
    The benefits of using roosters instead of hens to incubate chicks are: it does not affect the hens' egg-laying. Roosters have thick feathers and are large, incubating more eggs with a higher survival rate. At the same time, because the rooster's reproductive organs have been removed, it will develop to be fat and fleshy.

    Three-and-a-Half-Pound Garlic
    Members of the Lianhe Agricultural Cooperative in Wugong County harvested an astonishingly large garlic. The garlic plants were four feet tall, with an average weight of three pounds per plant, and the heaviest weighed three and a half pounds. The garlic bulbs were also very large, weighing eight or nine times more than ordinary garlic bulbs.
    This garlic was originally a hybrid of vegetable garlic and wild small garlic. In order to continue experimenting and promoting it, the Fourth Production Team of the Lianhe Cooperative first intercropped half an acre in fertile cucumber fields this year, planting 10,000 seedlings, producing a total of 30,000 jin. At the time of planting, the land was ploughed more than five inches deep, and 8,000 jin of base fertilizer and 30 jin of chemical fertilizer were applied. Later, topsoil and chemical fertilizer were applied three times, coupled with diligent watering and weeding, so the garlic grew extraordinarily large.

    New Wheat Variety
    Nie Jishan, a member of the Dongsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Chaoyi County, preliminarily cultivated a new wheat variety with large grains and a short maturity period through the method of hybridizing wheat and corn, after two generations of experimentation. Currently, the third generation of wheat seedlings are already more than two feet tall and are full and pregnant with ears. After this variety is successfully tested, it may be possible to harvest two crops of wheat a year locally.
    Recently, the cooperative established a scientific research group, which, in addition to continuing to cultivate new wheat varieties, has also begun to study new projects: grafting cotton and grapes, hybridizing peas and lentils, hybridizing sweet potatoes and potatoes, and new methods for preventing mole crickets and cotton aphids, etc. (Xinhua News Agency)

    农民学科学  敢想又敢做
    椿树上长棉花
    西安市雁塔区沙泘沱农业社六十六岁的老社员赵丙红，用靠接和接穗的办法，试验把棉花接在椿树上。
    赵丙红曾经用嫁接的方法，在椿树上接过一次棉花，但是完全失败了。后来用靠接和接穗的方法接了五株，结果活了三株。现在，接活的三株棉花已经长到四寸多高。为了进一步扩大试验成果，赵丙红最近又接了五株，其中有四株已开始长芽。
    公鸡孵鸡娃
    自古以来都是母鸡孵小鸡，哪见公鸡孵鸡娃。但是，陕西蒲城县林吉村农业社社员试验由公鸡孵小鸡成功。试验的方法是：割去公鸡的生殖器，用两杯酒把它灌醉，在醉酒期间，让醉鸡去孵小鸡。这样经过三天后，公鸡就不离蛋了，可以一直把小鸡孵出、养护到大。也有少数公鸡在酒醒后不愿孵蛋，需要再灌上两杯酒。
    公鸡代替母鸡孵小鸡的好处是：不影响母鸡下蛋。公鸡毛厚个子大，孵得多，成活率高。同时，因为公鸡割去了生殖器，会使公鸡发育胖大、膘厚肉肥。
    三斤六两重的大蒜
    武功县联合农业社的社员们收获了一种惊人肥大的大蒜。这种蒜株高四尺，平均每株重三斤，最重的三斤六两。蒜头也很大，比普通蒜头重八、九倍以上。
    这种蒜原是菜蒜和野小蒜杂交而成的。联合社第四生产队为了继续试验和推广，今年先在土质比较肥沃的黄瓜地里套种了半亩，栽苗一万株，共产三万斤。种时，翻地五寸多深，施底肥八千斤、化肥三十斤。后来又先后追了三次土肥和化肥，加上勤浇勤锄，因此蒜儿长得肥大惊人。
    小麦新品种
    朝邑县东升农业社社员聂积善，通过小麦和玉米杂交的方法，经过两代的试验，初步培育出一种颗粒大、成熟期短的小麦新品种。目前，第三代培育的麦苗又有二尺多高，正在饱肚孕穗。这种品种试验成功后，当地一年就有可能收割两季小麦。
    最近，这个社成立了科学研究小组，除继续培育小麦新品种外，还开始研究新的项目：棉花和葡萄嫁接、豌豆和扁豆杂交、红薯和洋芋杂交、以及防治蝼蛄、棉蚜的新方法等等。　　（新华社）
