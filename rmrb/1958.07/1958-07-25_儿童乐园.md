Children's Paradise
　　Since the 21st, hundreds of elementary school students have been happily spending their summer vacation at the Children's Paradise on Fuyou Street in Beijing.
　　In the library, stocked with 2,500 comic books, elementary school students are quietly and engrossed in reading "little books." In the table tennis room, the "little table tennis champions" are playing enthusiastically. The three tables are already insufficient, and many children are waiting for others to finish a game so they can go up and "have a try." Sixth-grade student Zhou Yunpeng likes to play table tennis very much. He often goes to the table tennis club to play, which costs 12 cents an hour, but at the Children's Paradise, it doesn't cost a penny. In the chess room, children are playing Chinese chess and checkers.
　　Elementary school students who participate in singing, art, recitation, dance, making groups, and football, table tennis, harmonica, and drama teams at the Children's Paradise engage in activities every other morning under the guidance of instructors. The Children's Paradise will also organize elementary school students to participate in labor in agricultural cooperatives and meet with outstanding individuals.
　　In order to make the summer vacation enjoyable and meaningful for elementary school students, the Xicheng District Children's Home, the District Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the three elementary schools of Fuyou Street, Yizi Hutong, and Houdali jointly organized this Children's Paradise and have full-time cadres. They are preparing to add seven or eight kinds of toy game rooms, such as pin the nose and ring toss, within this week, and next week the instructor will begin telling the story "Tracks in the Snowy Forest."

    儿童乐园
    从21日起，每天都有几百个小学生在北京市府右街儿童乐园愉快地度暑假。
    在备有两千五百本连环画的图书馆里，小学生们安静而入神地看“小人书”。在乒乓球室里，“小乒乓球健将”打得兴高彩烈，三个球台已经显得不够用，有好些孩子在一旁等着别人打过一局下来，自己好上去“过过瘾”，六年级学生周云朋很喜欢打乒乓球，他常到球社去打，一个钟头要花一角二分，儿童乐园却一分钱也不要。在棋艺室里，孩子们在下象棋、跳棋。
    在儿童乐园参加歌咏、艺术、朗诵、舞蹈、制做小组和足球、乒乓球、口琴、话剧队的小学生，每隔一天上午，在辅导员的指导下进行活动。儿童乐园还要组织小学生到农业社参加劳动，同优秀人物见面。
    为了使小学生们愉快而有意义地度过暑假，西城区少年之家、共青团区委和府右街、椅子胡同、后达里三个小学共同组织了这个儿童乐园，并设有专职干部。他们准备在本周内增设有贴鼻子、套圈等七、八种玩具的游戏室，下周开始由辅导员说评书“林海雪原”。
