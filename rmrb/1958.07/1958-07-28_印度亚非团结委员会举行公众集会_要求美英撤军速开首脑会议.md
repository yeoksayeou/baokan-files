Hatanaka Masaharu, a Japanese peace activist traveling in India, stated that the Japanese people support the Arab people and expressed the Japanese people's determination to fight alongside the people of Asian and African countries against the United States' atomic arms race and the nuclear armament of Japan.

Bram Prakash, Secretary-General of the India-China Friendship Association and member of Congress Party, congratulated the establishment of the Republic of Iraq and condemned the US-British aggression against Middle Eastern countries.

Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, Sundaral, said amid cheers: "India stands firmly with the Arabs." He said that the Arabs are not only fighting for the Arabs, but also for India, China, and all peace-loving peoples of all countries. The people of Asian and African countries hope for peace. He said amid warm cheers that the Arab countries can stop the aggressive actions taken by Britain and the United States. He pointed out that the Soviet Union is working to stop US-British aggression, and the Arab people have the support of the powerful Chinese people behind them.

    全印和平理事会主席森德拉尔在欢呼声中说：“印度同阿拉伯人坚定地站在一起。”他说，阿拉伯人不仅是为阿拉伯人而斗争，而且也是为印度、中国以及所有爱好和平的各国人民而斗争。亚非各国人民是希望和平的。他在热烈的欢呼声中说，阿拉伯国家可以制止英美采取的侵略行动。他指出，苏联正在为制止美英的侵略行动而努力，而且阿拉伯人民的背后有着强大的中国人民的支持。
