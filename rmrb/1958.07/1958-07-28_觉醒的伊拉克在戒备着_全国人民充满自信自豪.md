Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 26th: This reporter, Chen Bojian, reports that in the newly established Republic of Iraq, only twelve days old, I have found that from Prime Minister Qasim to the common people, the whole nation is filled with confidence and pride.

    On the streets, one can see that the people wholeheartedly support the revolution and its leaders. The people hate imperialism and hate the former King Faisal, Crown Prince Ira, Nuri al-Said, and their regime.

    Social life returned to normal immediately after the revolution. On my way from Damascus to Baghdad, I saw people working as usual. The work of building new roads continued as usual. In Baghdad, the traffic of vehicles, horses, and pedestrians was very crowded, and the neon lights of the shops shone brightly at night. On the famous Tigris River, which flows quietly through the capital of Iraq, fishermen were fishing, and there were many rowing boats and swimmers. The people of Baghdad sat in the gardens chatting. Friday is the Muslim day of rest, and people had their day off as usual.

    However, the Iraqis are not relaxing; they are on guard and vigilant. The ministers and responsible personnel of the new government are still working even at night. Large-scale military exercises were held in the desert, and tanks and field guns were on standby, ready to move at any time. The airports were heavily guarded. All weapons are ready.

    The reporter's deep impression is that if the imperialists dare to invade this awakened country, the army and people of Iraq are ready to defend their country.

    觉醒的伊拉克在戒备着
    全国人民充满自信自豪
    新华社巴格达26日电　本社记者陈伯坚报道，在刚刚成立十二天的伊拉克共和国，我发现从卡塞姆总理一直到普通老百姓的全国人民，都充满着自信和自豪。
    在街上，可以看到人民都是全心全意地支持革命和革命的领袖们。人民都憎恨帝国主义，都憎恨前国王费萨尔、王储伊拉和努里·赛义德以及他们的政权。
    社会生活在革命后马上就恢复正常。我在从大马士革前往巴格达的途中，看到人们都像往常一样地工作着。建筑新公路的工作照常进行。在巴格达，来往的车马行人非常拥挤，商店的霓虹灯在夜里全部放出光芒。在安静地流过伊拉克首都的著名的底格里斯河上，渔夫在捕鱼，河里有许多运动用的划艇和游泳的人。巴格达人坐在花园里谈心。星期五是穆斯林的休息天，人们照常放假了。
    但是，伊拉克人并没有松懈下来，他们在戒备着和警惕着。新政府的部长们和负责人员甚至在夜间还在工作。在沙漠中举行了大规模的军事演习，坦克和野战炮都在待命随时出动。飞机场四周都有重兵防守。一切武器都准备停当。
    记者的深刻印象是，如果帝国主义者胆敢侵略这个已经觉醒了的国家的话，伊拉克的军队和人民都准备保卫他们的国家。
