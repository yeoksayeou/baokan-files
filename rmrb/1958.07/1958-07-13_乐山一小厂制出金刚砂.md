Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 12th: The jointly operated Leshan County Jianxin Industrial Materials Factory in Sichuan Province has produced an important industrial material – corundum – using simple equipment. Microscopic photography and instrument calculations have shown that the hardness, particle size, and uniformity of the corundum meet international standards. The factory currently produces twenty-five specifications of corundum. This small factory has more than forty employees, with only one technician. The factory buildings are dilapidated, and apart from a ball mill for crushing raw materials, there are only a few water tanks and some wooden barrels.

    乐山一小厂制出金刚砂
    新华社成都12日电　四川省地方合营乐山县坚信工业材料厂，利用简陋设备，生产出重要的工业材料——金刚砂。经过显微镜照像和仪器测算，金刚砂的硬度、粒度（砂粒尺寸）、匀度都符合国际标准。这个厂现在生产的金刚砂有二十五种规格。这个小型工厂四十多个职工，只有一个技术人员；厂房破旧，除一个粉碎原料的球磨机外，就是几个水池和一些木桶。
