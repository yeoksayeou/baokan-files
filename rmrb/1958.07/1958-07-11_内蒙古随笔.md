Random Notes on Inner Mongolia
    Lin Boqu

    On the Jingbao Road
    Awakened from a dream on the train at dawn, ten thousand horses gallop past Datong.
    The grassland is full of vitality, and the east wind blows everywhere in the world.

    Hohhot City
    Hohhot's Great Leap Forward far surpasses the old and new cities of Gui Sui.
    Three million meters of new buildings, all for workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers.

    Buta Banner Township Ethnic United Cooperative
    The small station is also commendable, with a capacity of 7.5 kilowatts.
    It drives three processing plants, lighting up nine hundred homes in the entire cooperative.

    Scene in Baotou
    North of the Yellow River, south of the Green Mountains, Baogang's molten steel illuminates the sky.
    Five million tons are as easy as turning a hand, forming a tripod with Daye and Anshan.

    Recent News on Steel
    High-yield furnaces are built large, medium, and small, with an annual output of one million tons.
    Don't say that surpassing England requires fifteen years; it seems we have already taken the lead.

    Economic Cooperation
    Precisely because the Big Dipper is high, we build a magpie bridge to cross the Milky Way.
    It's best to arrange everything face to face, and not let shields hinder the vanguard.

    内蒙古随笔
    林伯渠
    京包道上
    向晨一觉车中梦，万马奔腾过大同。
    正是草原生意满，人间到处有东风。
    呼和浩特市
    呼和浩特大跃进，远胜归绥新旧城。
    新建筑三百万米，都为工农商学兵。
    布塔旗乡民族联合社
    小型车站亦堪夸，能力七点五千瓦。
    带动加工厂三处，照亮全社九百家。
    包头即景
    黄河之北青山南，包钢融融火烛天。
    五百万吨如反掌，鼎足大冶与鞍山。
    钢铁近讯
    高平炉建大中小，吨量年产百万千。
    莫道超英需十五，看来业已着先鞭。
    经济协作
    正因北斗七星高，为渡银河起鹊桥。
    万事安排当面好，不任盾牌阻前茅。
