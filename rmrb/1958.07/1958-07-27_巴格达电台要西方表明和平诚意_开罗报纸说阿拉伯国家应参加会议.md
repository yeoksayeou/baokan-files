    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 25th: Iraq Republic Radio, in commenting on the conspiracies of Western nations against Arab countries, said that if the West's propaganda about safeguarding world peace is genuine, the West should seize the opportunity of holding a summit conference. Britain and the United States should first withdraw their troops from Jordan and Lebanon. This is the only thing the West can do to restore its reputation.
    The radio said that only when the West recognizes these things and abandons the policies of the 19th century can world peace be truly established, and the people of all countries will not be disturbed by the fear of war or aggression. However, what the West is doing now is supporting a small group of traitors against the whole country. This policy has suffered a great failure in the past and will suffer a greater failure in the near future.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 25th: Cairo's morning newspapers today published editorials welcoming the Soviet proposal to hold a summit conference to discuss the Middle East situation.
    "People's News" said that Arab countries should participate in the conference because the leaders of Western countries have no right to make decisions about Middle Eastern countries without consulting the people of the Middle East.
    "Al-Ahram" welcomed the summit conference, saying that the summit conference is a step towards peace.
    "Al-Gomhouria" said that holding a summit conference has become very necessary because of the current tense situation caused by the armed occupation of Lebanon and Jordan by Britain and the United States.

    巴格达电台要西方表明和平诚意
    开罗报纸说阿拉伯国家应参加会议
    新华社巴格达25日电　伊拉克共和国电台在评述西方国家反对阿拉伯国家的阴谋的时候说，如果西方关于保障世界和平的宣传是真实的，西方应该利用召开政府首脑会议这个机会。英美应当首先从约旦和黎巴嫩撤军。这是西方为挽回声誉所能做的唯一的事情。
    电台说，只有在西方认识这些事情，抛弃了十九世纪的政策以后，世界和平才能真正确立，各国人民才能不会为战争或侵略的恐惧所骚扰。但是，现在西方所做的事情却是支持一小撮卖国贼反对全国。这种政策过去已经遭到巨大的失败，并且将在最近的将来遭到更大的失败。
    据新华社开罗25日电　开罗各早报今天都发表社论欢迎苏联建议召开的讨论中东局势的政府首脑会议。
    “人民报”说，阿拉伯国家应当参加会议，因为西方国家的领导人没有权利在不同中东人民磋商的情况下作出有关中东国家的决定。
    “金字塔报”表示欢迎首脑会议，它说，首脑会议是向和平迈进的一步。
    “共和国报”说，由于英美武装占领黎巴嫩和约旦以后造成了当前的紧张局势，举行首脑会议已经成为非常必要的事。
