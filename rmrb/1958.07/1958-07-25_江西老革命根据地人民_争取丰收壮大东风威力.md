Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 24th: The people in the old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi Province, with their glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle, have been holding rallies and demonstrations in recent days to strongly protest the armed aggression against the Middle East by US-British imperialism.
    In Ruijin County, the "Red Capital," more than 70,000 people have held successive rallies and demonstrations in recent days, and posted more than 30,000 slogans, protesting the piratical acts of US-British imperialism. At a protest rally in Shazhouba, old heroes of the Soviet era expressed their strong protest to US-British imperialism. Yang Ronglian, a veteran Red Army soldier, said, "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the Kuomintang and drive out the imperialists. The Chinese people have rich experience in fighting against all reactionaries. If US-British imperialism does not stop its armed aggression against the Middle East, we will never sit idly by." Xie Chundi, an old female revolutionary fighter, expressed her determination to strive for a bumper harvest to further strengthen the power of the East Wind.
    In the revolutionary cradle of Jinggang Mountain and Yiyang, Ningdu, Yongxin, and other places, the people have held rallies in recent days, resolutely demanding that the US-British aggressor troops immediately get out of the Middle East. At a protest rally held at the Anyuan Coal Mine, Yuan Pingao, the vice-chairman of the mine trade union who participated in the Anyuan Great Strike led by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, said angrily: "The armed aggression against the Middle East by US-British imperialism is doomed to failure. More than 30 years ago, we defeated German and Japanese imperialism with our bare hands, defeated the warlords of the Northern Warlords, the running dogs of imperialism, and achieved the victory of the Anyuan Great Strike, which shocked the whole country. Today, when the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, US-British imperialism's aggression against the Middle East is tantamount to digging its own grave!"

    江西老革命根据地人民
    争取丰收壮大东风威力
    新华社南昌24日电　有着光荣的革命斗争传统的江西省革命老根据地人民，连日举行集会和示威游行强硬抗议美英帝国主义武装侵略中东。
    红都瑞金县七万多人最近几天接连举行集会和示威游行，并且贴出三万多张标语，抗议美英帝国主义的海盗行为。在沙洲坝举行的抗议大会上，苏区时代的革命老英雄们向美英帝国主义表示强硬抗议。老红军战士杨荣连说：“共产党和毛主席领导我们打倒了国民党赶走了帝国主义，中国人民对一切反动派有着丰富的斗争经验，如果美英帝国主义不停止对中东的武装侵略，我们决不会袖手旁观。”老女革命战士谢春娣表示要争取丰收来更加壮大东风的威力。
    革命摇篮井冈山和弋阳、宁都、永新等地的人民在最近几天陆续举行集会，坚决要求美英侵略军立即滚出中东去。在安源煤矿举行的抗议大会上，曾经参加过刘少奇同志领导的安源大罢工的老工人、现矿务局工会副主席袁品高愤怒地说：“美英帝国主义武装侵略中东是注定要失败的。三十多年前，我们赤手空拳都战胜了德、日帝国主义，战胜了帝国主义的走狗北洋军阀，取得了震惊全国的安源大罢工的胜利。在东风压倒西风的今天，美英帝国主义侵略中东，那就是自找坟墓！”
