Comrades and Friends!

We, the people of all circles in Beijing, are holding a mass rally here today to support the Republic of Iraq, to support the national independence movement of the Lebanese people, to demand that the troops of US imperialism immediately withdraw from Lebanon, to oppose US interference in the internal affairs of the Arab countries, and to celebrate the great victory of the Iraqi national independence movement.

Today, some of us Asian and African people have already thrown off the shackles of colonialism, stood up, and become masters of our own affairs, while others are waging unyielding and heroic struggles for their freedom, independence, and liberation. The vigorous and ever-rising national independence movements in Asian and African countries are advancing victoriously. The colonial system is collapsing irrevocably. This self-destructive fate of imperialism cannot be reversed even by their God.

Comrades and Friends! We are very pleased to receive the encouraging news from Iraq. On July 13, the Iraqi army and people launched a revolution, overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Faisal dynasty, the running dogs of US and British imperialism, and established the Republic of Iraq. This is a great victory for the Iraqi people, the Arab people, and all peace-loving people in the world. This is a heavy blow to imperialist colonial rule in the Middle East. There is no doubt that this victory of the Iraqi people will promote a new upsurge in the national independence movements in Asian and African countries. All the imperialists pressing down on the heads of the Asian and African people will continue to suffer one defeat after another.

Our government announced yesterday its recognition of the Republic of Iraq. We warmly congratulate the birth of the Republic of Iraq, and warmly congratulate the great victory of the Iraqi people!

Everyone knows that the struggles of the Iraqi and Lebanese people are the internal affairs of these two countries, and no country has the right to interfere with the freedom of the people of other countries to choose their own government. However, US imperialism blatantly disregarded everything and, under the absurd pretext of so-called protecting American expatriates and defending Lebanese sovereignty, sent armed forces to land in Lebanon on July 15, carrying out open armed intervention in Lebanon. This is a blatant violation of international law and the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter by US imperialism. This is naked interference and aggression against Lebanon by US imperialism. This is a blatant threat and provocation to the Arab people by US imperialism. This military adventurous conspiracy of US imperialism is a continuation of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt in 1956 and the US conspiracy to invade Syria in 1957. The actions of US imperialism are seriously threatening peace in West Asia, North Africa, and the world. We, the Chinese people, and all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, with incomparable anger, strongly condemn and protest this shameful and barbaric act of aggression, intervention, and war adventure by US imperialism! The US invading troops must immediately get out of Lebanon and immediately stop this mad war provocation! We fully support the national independence movement of the Lebanese people! We will do everything in our power to support the just struggle of the Iraqi people against imperialism and to defend national independence and freedom!

The people of all countries have the right to choose their own government, and no foreign interference is allowed. The US government has now completely dropped its mask, and nakedly revealed its imperialist wolfish nature further in front of the people of the world, and this nature can never be concealed by any excuse it makes.

We Chinese people have long seen through this wolfish nature of US imperialism. In the past, in our struggle against US imperialism, we not only severely打击 [dǎ jī - strike, hit] its aggressive arrogance and achieved brilliant victories, but also proved to the world that the ferocious and menacing US imperialism is nothing to be afraid of. It is just a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak inside, and its aggression and provocations can be completely defeated. During our Liberation War, the United States also sent many troops to carry out armed threats; however, in the face of the united, powerful, and persistent Chinese people, the US troops finally tucked their tails and rolled out of mainland China. The United States also launched a war of aggression against Korea, interfered in Korean internal affairs, and threatened the new China; however, with the support of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world, the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, after three years of heroic struggle, finally drove US imperialism back to the 38th parallel, and finally had to admit defeat in fact and accept the armistice. Now, US imperialism is still forcibly occupying our territory of Taiwan. We Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and we have full confidence that we will definitely be able to liberate Taiwan. The US troops must get out of our territory of Taiwan, and we firmly believe that the righteous people will surely win the final victory. In the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, imperialism is even more clearly destined to fail.

The war of aggression against Egypt launched by British and French imperialism in 1956, and the military threat to Syria carried out by US imperialism in 1957, were both met with shameful defeat under the resolute counterattack of the Arab people and with the support of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world. The heroic and united Arab people achieved brilliant victories. We must seriously warn the US aggressors who are now creating a war crisis in the Middle East: Quickly pull back from the brink, immediately stop your war provocations, immediately stop your aggressive actions, and the US invading troops immediately get out of Lebanon! Otherwise, you will surely suffer the consequences and hasten your own destruction. The inevitability of historical development is irresistible.

Lebanon, Iraq, and all Arab people are not isolated in their just struggle for independence and freedom. We, the 600 million Chinese people, will stand together with the people of Asian and African countries and all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, and fully support the struggle of the Arab people today on the anti-imperialist and anti-aggression front in the Middle East. We firmly believe that victory will surely belong to the righteous and heroic Arab people.

    中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委第一书记、北京市市长彭真讲话
    中国全力支持伊黎两国人民的正义斗争
    美国侵略者必须立即停止战争挑衅，否则将自食其果同胞们，同志们，朋友们！
    我们北京各界人民，现在在这里举行群众大会，支持伊拉克共和国，支持黎巴嫩人民民族独立运动，要求美帝国主义的军队立即撤出黎巴嫩，反对美国干涉阿拉伯各国人民的内政，并且庆祝伊拉克民族独立运动的伟大胜利。
    今天我们亚非人民，有的已经摆脱了殖民主义的枷锁，站了起来，成为自己的主人，有的正在为自己的自由、独立和解放进行着不屈不挠的英勇斗争。蓬蓬勃勃、日益高涨的亚非各国民族独立运动正在胜利的前进。殖民主义体系正在日益不可挽回地土崩瓦解着。帝国主义的这种自取灭亡的命运，是连他们的上帝也不能挽回的。
    同胞们，同志们，朋友们！我们十分高兴地得到了从伊拉克传来的令人鼓舞的消息。7月13日，伊拉克的军队和人民发动了革命，推翻了美英帝国主义走狗费萨尔王朝的反动统治，建立了伊拉克共和国。这是伊拉克人民，也是阿拉伯人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的一个伟大的胜利。这是对帝国主义在中东的殖民统治的一个沉重打击。毫无疑问，伊拉克人民的这个胜利将促进亚非各国民族独立运动的新的高涨。压在亚非人民头上的一切帝国主义者必将继续遭受一个接一个的惨败。
    我国政府已经在昨天宣布承认伊拉克共和国。我们热烈祝贺伊拉克共和国的诞生，热烈祝贺伊拉克人民的伟大胜利！
    谁都知道，伊拉克人民和黎巴嫩人民的斗争都是这两个国家的内政，任何国家都无权干涉别国人民选择他们自己的政府的自由。但是美国帝国主义竟悍然不顾一切，在所谓保护美国侨民和保卫黎巴嫩主权的荒谬借口之下，在7月15日派遣武装部队在黎巴嫩登陆，对黎巴嫩进行公开的武装干涉。这是美国帝国主义对国际公法和联合国宪章根本原则的公然破坏。这是美国帝国主义对黎巴嫩的赤裸裸的干涉和侵略。这是美国帝国主义对阿拉伯各国人民的露骨的威胁和挑衅。美国帝国主义者对黎巴嫩的武装干涉的矛头不仅针对着黎巴嫩而且针对着阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克共和国。美国帝国主义的这种军事冒险阴谋，是1956年英法对埃及侵略事件和1957年美国对叙利亚阴谋侵略事件的继续。美国帝国主义的行动正在严重地威胁着西亚、北非和全世界的和平。我们中国人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民，以无比的愤怒，强烈地谴责和抗议美国帝国主义这一可耻的野蛮的侵略干涉和战争冒险的行动！美国侵略军队必须立即滚出黎巴嫩，立即停止这种疯狂的战争挑衅！我们完全支持黎巴嫩人民的民族独立运动！我们要尽一切力量支持伊拉克人民反对帝国主义、保卫民族独立和自由的正义斗争！
    各国人民有权选择自己的政府，决不容许任何外国的干涉。美国政府现在已经完全放下它的假面具，在全世界人民面前赤裸裸地进一步显露出它的帝国主义的豺狼的本相，这种本相绝不是它所制造的任何借口所能掩饰的。
    美国帝国主义的这种豺狼本相，我们中国人民早已经识破。过去我们在对美国帝国主义的斗争中，不但狠狠地打击了它的侵略气焰，取得了辉煌的胜利，并且还向全世界证明了，穷凶极恶、张牙舞爪的美国帝国主义并没有什么可怕，它不过是一个外强中干的纸老虎，它的侵略和挑衅是完全可以打败的。在我们解放战争时期，美国也曾经派来不少军队，实行武装威胁；但是，在团结一致的强大的、坚持斗争的中国人民面前，美国军队终于夹着尾巴从中国大陆滚出去了。美国还发动过侵略朝鲜的战争，干涉朝鲜内政，威胁新中国；但是，在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军经过三年的英勇斗争，美国帝国主义终于被打退到三八线，终于不得不在事实上承认失败，接受停战。现在，美国帝国主义还武力侵占着我国的领土台湾。我们中国人民一定要解放台湾，并且有完全的信心，一定能够解放台湾。美国军队必须从我国领土台湾滚出去，我们深信，正义的人民一定会取得最后的胜利，在东风压倒西风的形势下，帝国主义更加明显地是注定要失败的。
    1956年英、法帝国主义所发动的侵略埃及的战争，1957年美国帝国主义对叙利亚所进行的武力威胁，在阿拉伯人民的坚决反击之下，在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持之下，都遭到了可耻的失败，英勇的、团结的阿拉伯人民取得了辉煌的胜利。我们要严重警告现在在中东制造战争危机的美国侵略者：赶快悬崖勒马，立即停止战争挑衅，立即停止侵略行动，美国侵略军队立即滚出黎巴嫩！否则，必将自食其果，自速灭亡。历史发展的必然性是不可抗拒的。
    黎巴嫩、伊拉克和所有阿拉伯人民在为争取独立和自由而进行的正义斗争中，决不是孤立的。我们六亿中国人民将同亚非各国人民和全世界所有爱好和平的国家和人民在一起，全力支持阿拉伯人民今天在中东反帝国主义、反对侵略的前线上的斗争。我们深信，胜利是一定属于正义的、英勇的阿拉伯人民。
