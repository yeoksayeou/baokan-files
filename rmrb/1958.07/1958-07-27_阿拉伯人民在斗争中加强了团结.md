	Arab People Strengthen Unity in Struggle

	Arab countries have consistently focused on strengthening their unity in the struggle against imperialist aggression. This is a crucial aspect of the continuous development of their national independence movements.

	On March 22, 1945, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and other seven Arab nations formed the Arab League. Libya and Sudan also joined the League in 1953 and 1956, respectively. This was originally meant to lay the cornerstone for unity and cooperation among Arab nations. The Arab League Charter stipulated close cooperation among the member states in defending their independence and sovereignty. The Arab League Joint Defense Treaty, signed in 1950 and effective in 1952, further solidified the obligation of mutual assistance among Arab countries in repelling aggression.

	In its initial stages, the Arab League demonstrated the united struggle and common will of Arab nations against colonialism. In 1945, when discussing the withdrawal of French troops from Syria and Lebanon, the Arab League nations firmly demanded that the French troops, who continued to occupy Syria and Lebanon after the war, immediately withdraw from the territories of these two countries. Simultaneously, they demanded the withdrawal of British troops from Palestine and opposed Britain's plot to use Palestine as a base for its aggression against Middle Eastern countries. In 1951, the League supported Egypt's demand for the withdrawal of British troops from the Suez Canal Zone. At the end of 1951, the League issued a statement rejecting the US-British plan to establish a "Middle East Command." In January 1954, the League Council adopted a program for League nations: the eight member states guaranteed that their governments would not join any military alliance. In April of the same year, the League issued a statement declaring that Arab nations refused to participate in the Turkish-Pakistani pact.

	This series of united struggles by Arab nations against colonial rule and imperialist conspiracies to establish military blocs in the Middle East significantly hampered the aggressive plans of imperialism. Imperialism then intensified its use of various despicable means of division and subversion to undermine the unity of Arab nations and further foster puppet regimes in some Arab countries, pursuing the heinous policy of "Arabs fighting Arabs."

	The Tripartite Declaration of aggression against the Middle East issued by the US, Britain, and France in 1950 not only attempted to divide their spheres of influence in the Middle East and consolidate their rule but also aimed to establish a military bloc in the Middle East, ready to take action and launch armed aggression against Arab national independent countries to suppress national independence movements. As the plan to establish a "Middle East Command" met with widespread opposition from Arab nations, US and British imperialism chose the reactionary Faisal dynasty of Iraq as the cornerstone for piecing together a military bloc. The reactionary Iraqi government abandoned the Arab League Charter, became the initiator of the Baghdad Pact, and was the sole Arab member state. From then on, US and British imperialism made every effort to draw Lebanon, Jordan, and other Arab nations into the Baghdad Pact organization. However, this conspiracy did not succeed. Syria and Egypt provisionally signed a joint defense treaty in Damascus in October 1955; at the same time, Saudi Arabia and Egypt also signed a similar defense treaty. Both treaties stipulated that if any of the contracting parties were subjected to aggression, the other party would provide assistance. In January 1956, the Prime Ministers of Syria and Lebanon met and announced that they had agreed to conclude a bilateral military defense treaty. Jordan, even after the nationalist regime was overthrown by the United States, and despite pressure from the people, the Hussein dynasty still dared not join the Baghdad Pact.

	In 1956, after Britain, France, and Israel launched the war of aggression against Egypt, Arab nations once again demonstrated their unity. The Arab League summit expressed its firm solidarity with Egypt and issued an ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of the British, French, and Israeli aggressor troops. Syria and Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic relations with Britain and France, while Jordan severed diplomatic relations with France. The Arab brothers in Syria resolutely cut off the oil pipelines passing through Syrian territory that supplied the imperialists. Saudi Arabia also cut off oil supplies to Britain and France. Lebanon expressed its support for Egypt's struggle and prevented US military vessels from approaching the port of Beirut. Other Arab League member states, Libya and Sudan, also expressed their support for Egypt's anti-aggression war. Only the Said government of Iraq not only allowed the British Air Force to use Iraqi airfields to bomb Egypt but also took the opportunity to supply a large number of weapons to conspirators in Syria to subvert the Syrian government. The united opposition of most Arab nations to the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt was an important factor in Egypt's defeat of the aggressors.

	Taking advantage of the failure of the Anglo-French-Israeli war of aggression against Egypt, the United States put forward the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to fill the "vacuum" in the Middle East and Africa, attempting to seize the colonial positions of Britain and France and suppress the national independence movements in the region. When the United States sent special envoy Richards to the Middle East countries to peddle the "Eisenhower Doctrine," Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Libya, and other four Arab countries expressed their acceptance of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," but the Jordanian nationalist government resolutely refused to accept it. This aroused even more frantic hostility from the United States towards the Jordanian government. In April 1957, the United States did not hesitate to adopt despicable subversive means to overthrow the Jordanian nationalist government. This was a step in the US conspiracy to isolate Syria and Egypt and further enslave the people of Arab nations. However, the US act of subverting the Jordanian government exposed the sinister face of US imperialism and aroused great anger among the people of Arab nations.

	After achieving the subversive conspiracy in Jordan, the United States immediately stepped up its subversive activities against Syria. In August 1957, the Syrian military authorities cracked a major conspiracy by a US spy organization to subvert the Syrian nationalist regime. Enraged, the United States planned a military aggression against Syria. On August 22, the United States dispatched Handerson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, to the Middle East to conspire with the reactionary rulers of Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and other countries to draft a plan for military aggression against Syria. Subsequently, Turkey began to mobilize large forces to the Syrian border, and the US Sixth Fleet also sailed to the Eastern Mediterranean. For a time, dark clouds filled the Middle East, and war seemed imminent. However, this conspiracy of aggression was once again opposed by most Arab nations. Syria resolutely resisted, and Egypt stood by Syria. The Soviet Union issued warnings to the United States and Turkey. Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations also expressed their disapproval of the US conspiracy of aggression. At the same time, Syria also filed a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly, accusing the United States and its lackey Turkey of aggression. This complaint was supported by the Soviet Union and Asian and African countries. The US plan of aggression finally went bankrupt shamefully.

	In February 1958, Egypt and Syria established the United Arab Republic, followed by Yemen, which formed the United Arab States with the UAR. This union won the support of the broad masses of the Arab people and achieved a great victory in promoting the unity of Arab nations, thwarting all conspiracies to divide the Arab people, and maintaining national independence and the common struggle against colonialism. US and British imperialism immediately instigated Iraq and Jordan to piece together a so-called "Arab Federation" to counter the United Arab Republic in order to continue to pursue the policy of undermining the unity of the Arab peoples. However, the "Arab Federation" not only failed to attract other Arab countries to join it but also exposed from the very beginning that it was a tool of imperialism, and its prestige among the Arab peoples plummeted. The victory of the Iraqi people's revolution on July 14 this year destroyed the "Arab Federation" and broke the spine of the Baghdad Pact; Iraq also immediately concluded a joint defense agreement with the United Arab Republic, which dealt a fatal blow to the US and British imperialist conspiracy to divide and invade Arab nations. After the US and Britain launched an aggression against the Middle East, the people of Arab countries, with the support of the socialist camp and peace-loving people, launched a vigorous struggle against the US and British aggressors.

	The victory of the Arab peoples in smashing imperialist conspiracies of division and strengthening the unity of Arab nations is a guarantee for the Arab people's struggle to win and safeguard national independence and defend peace in the Middle East. As long as the Arab people continue to strengthen unity and persist in struggle, they will be able to defeat the aggressive plans of US and British imperialism, and finally completely destroy the evil shackles of colonialism, so that the Arab East can be completely liberated.

### 阿拉伯人民在斗争中加强了团结

    阿拉伯人民在斗争中加强了团结
    阿拉伯各国在反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中，一直注意加强它们之间的团结，这是它们争取民族独立运动不断获得发展的重要一环。
    1945年3月22日，埃及、伊拉克、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、约旦、沙特阿拉伯、也门等七个阿拉伯国家组成了阿拉伯联盟。利比亚和苏丹也先后在1953年和1956年加入了这个联盟。这原是奠定阿拉伯国家团结和合作的基石。阿拉伯联盟公约规定各国进行紧密合作，保卫他们的独立和主权。1950年签订的、1952年生效的阿拉伯联盟防御条约，更进一步确立了阿拉伯各国互相援助反击侵略的义务。
    阿拉伯联盟在其成立的最初阶段，就显示出了阿拉伯各国反对殖民主义者的团结斗争和共同意志。1945年阿拉伯联盟各国在讨论法国军队从叙利亚和黎巴嫩撤出的问题时，坚决要求战后继续占领叙利亚和黎巴嫩的法国军队立即从这两个国家的领土上撤出去。同时，他们要求英国军队撤出巴勒斯坦，反对英国把巴勒斯坦作为其侵略中东各国的基地的阴谋。1951年，联盟又支持埃及提出的关于英军撤出苏伊士运河区的要求。1951年底，联盟发表声明，拒绝美英提出的成立“中东司令部”的计划。1954年1月联盟理事会通过联盟国家的纲领：联盟八国保证它们的政府不得加入任何军事同盟。同年4月，联盟发表声明，宣布阿拉伯国家拒绝参加土巴协定。
    阿拉伯国家这一系列反对殖民统治和帝国主义在中东建立军事集团的阴谋的团结斗争，使帝国主义的侵略计划遇到很大的困难。帝国主义便加紧使用各种卑鄙的分化和颠覆手段，来破坏阿拉伯国家的团结，并进一步在一些阿拉伯国家中扶植傀儡政权，推行“阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人”的罪恶政策。
    美英法在1950年发表的侵略中东的三国宣言，就不仅企图划分它们在中东的势力范围，巩固它们的统治，而且要在中东建立军事集团，随时采取行动，武装侵略阿拉伯民族独立国家，镇压民族独立运动。由于建立“中东司令部”的计划遭到阿拉伯国家的普遍反对，美英帝国主义就选择了伊拉克费萨尔反动王朝，作为拼凑军事集团的基石。伊拉克反动政府背弃阿拉伯联盟公约，成了巴格达条约的倡议者和唯一的阿拉伯国家成员国。从此以后，美英帝国主义竭力企图把黎巴嫩、约旦和其他阿拉伯国家拉进巴格达条约组织。但是，这个阴谋没有得逞。叙利亚和埃及于1955年10月在大马士革临时签署了共同防御条约；同时，沙特阿拉伯和埃及又签订了相似的防御条约。这两个条约都规定，订约双方任何一国遭受到侵略时，另一国予以援助。1956年1月，叙利亚和黎巴嫩两国总理会谈，宣布他们已同意缔结一项双边军事防御条约。约旦一直到民族主义政权被美国推翻后，侯赛因王朝在人民的压力下仍不敢参加巴格达条约。
    1956年，英法以发动侵埃战争后，阿拉伯国家再一次表现了团结力量。阿拉伯联盟各国首脑会议表示坚决地同埃及站在一起，并发出了要求英法以侵略军撤退的最后通牒。叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯都和英法断绝了外交关系，约旦则同法国断绝外交关系。叙利亚的阿拉伯兄弟们坚决地切断了帝国主义通过叙利亚境内的油管。沙特阿拉伯也不给英法以石油供应。黎巴嫩表示支持埃及的斗争，不让美国军用船只靠近贝鲁特港。其他的阿拉伯联盟成员国利比亚和苏丹，也表示支持埃及的反侵略战争。只有伊拉克的赛义德政府不仅听任英国空军使用伊拉克机场来轰炸埃及，同时还乘机把大批的武器供给叙利亚的阴谋分子来颠覆叙利亚政府。大多数阿拉伯国家团结一致地反对英法以侵略埃及，是埃及击败侵略者的重要因素。
    美国利用英法以侵略埃及战争的失败，提出在中东和非洲填补“真空”的“艾森豪威尔主义”，企图夺取英法的殖民地位，镇压这个地区的民族独立运动。当美国派出特使理查兹到中东各国兜售“艾森豪威尔主义”时，黎巴嫩、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、利比亚等四个阿拉伯国家都表示接受“艾森豪威尔主义”，但约旦民族主义政府则坚决拒绝接受。这就引起了美国对约旦政府的更加疯狂的敌视。美国竟于1957年4月不惜采取卑鄙的颠覆手段推翻了约旦民族主义政府。这是美国企图孤立叙利亚和埃及，进而奴役阿拉伯国家人民的阴谋步骤。可是，美国颠覆约旦政府的行为，暴露了美帝国主义的凶恶面目，在阿拉伯各国人民中引起了极大的愤怒。
    美国在约旦实现了颠覆阴谋后，立即加紧了对叙利亚的颠覆活动。1957年8月，叙利亚军事当局破获了一件由美国间谍组织颠覆叙利亚民族主义政权的大阴谋案。恼羞成怒的美国便策划对叙利亚的军事侵略。8月22日，美国派遣国务院负责中东事务的副国务卿帮办汉德逊去中东，同土耳其、黎巴嫩、约旦、伊拉克等国的反动统治者进行密谋，拟订了一个军事侵略叙利亚的计划。接着，土耳其开始向叙利亚边境调集大军，美国第六舰队也开到了东地中海，一时中东上空布满乌云，战争有一触即发之势。但是，这个侵略阴谋再度受到大多数阿拉伯国家的反对。叙利亚坚决反抗，埃及站在叙利亚一边。苏联对美国和土耳其发出了警告。沙特阿拉伯和其他阿拉伯国家也表示不赞同美国的侵略阴谋。同时，叙利亚还向联合国大会提出控诉案，控诉美国和它的奴仆土耳其的侵略活动。这个控诉案得到了苏联和亚非国家的支持。美国的侵略计划终于可耻地破产了。
    1958年2月埃及和叙利亚建立了阿拉伯联合共和国，接着也门又同阿联结成了阿拉伯联合邦。这个联合，获得了广大阿拉伯人民的支持，在推动阿拉伯各国的团结、击破一切分裂阿拉伯人民的阴谋、维护民族独立与反殖民主义的共同斗争中，取得了一个很大的胜利。美英帝国主义立即唆使伊拉克和约旦拼凑了一个所谓“阿拉伯联邦”，来同阿拉伯联合共和国唱对台戏，以便继续推行破坏阿拉伯各国人民的团结的政策。但是，“阿拉伯联邦”不仅不能拉拢到其他阿拉伯国家参加，而且一开始就暴露出它是帝国主义的工具，在阿拉伯各国人民中威信扫地。今年7月14日，伊拉克人民革命的胜利摧毁了“阿拉伯联邦”，打断了巴格达条约的脊骨；伊拉克还立即同阿拉伯联合共和国缔结了共同防御协定，这都使美英帝国主义分裂和侵略阿拉伯国家的阴谋，遭到了致命的打击。在美英发动了对中东的侵略以后，阿拉伯各国人民在社会主义阵营和爱好和平人民的支持下，对美英侵略者展开了有力的斗争。
    阿拉伯各国人民粉碎帝国主义分裂阴谋，加强阿拉伯国家的团结，是阿拉伯人民争取和维护民族独立、保卫中东和平的斗争的胜利保证。只要阿拉伯人民不断加强团结，坚持斗争，他们就能够击败美英帝国主义的侵略计划，最后彻底摧毁万恶的殖民主义枷锁，使阿拉伯东方得到完全解放。　（西明）
