Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 24th (Reporter Kang Guozhi) reported: The Sixth Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building recently convened a National Automotive Design Conference at the First Automobile Works.

    The conference reflected the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in China's automotive industry, prompting people to liberate their design thinking, break the mysterious view of manufacturing automobiles, and adopt a method of combining "indigenous" and "foreign" approaches to promote the rapid development of the national automotive industry.

    This conference was an unprecedented grand gathering of national automotive design personnel. Representatives from nearly sixty units, including automobile manufacturing plants, automobile repair and assembly plants, machinery plants, as well as automotive industry research institutions, universities, and provincial and municipal industrial transportation departments, participated in the conference. The conference focused on exchanging experiences in designing and trial-producing automobiles using more than twenty indigenous methods, foreign methods, and combinations of indigenous and foreign methods, and also resolved some new problems that have arisen in the current situation of the Great Leap Forward.

    The national automotive industry has developed through constantly overcoming the constraints of conservative thinking and dogmatism. To date, in addition to the First Automobile Works, more than forty factories have produced dozens of types of trucks, buses, and sedans, most of which are small-scale automobile repair and assembly plants. These small factories have many rich indigenous methods and experiences in designing and trial-producing automobiles that are worth paying attention to. These methods and experiences are created by concentrating the wisdom and drive of the workers in each factory. The common feature of these factories' practices is that they start from the specific conditions of their own factories, face reality, rely on the masses, and solve problems in automobile design and trial production; in this work, they boldly conduct new attempts, without being restricted by any rules and regulations or book knowledge. The veteran workers in these factories have many years of experience in repairing automobiles and are particularly familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of various automobiles, as well as the methods of processing parts. Therefore, most of these factories have not drawn a single drawing but have manufactured automobiles using only simple equipment and manual operation. The Luoyang Automobile Maintenance Plant, for example, used only four machine tools in the entire plant to produce an automobile in six days. The design features of this automobile are: small size, maneuverability, strong climbing ability, and the ability to pass through rural roads that horse-drawn carts can pass through; it can use gasoline or coal, making the source of fuel convenient; it can be used for transportation or as a power machine. This type of automobile is precisely what some scientific research departments have been trying to design for a long time but have not yet succeeded in designing.

    Through the exchange of experiences, the conference enabled small factories to learn "foreign" methods of designing automobiles, and large factories to learn "indigenous" methods, further clarifying the importance of adopting methods such as combining indigenous and foreign approaches, combining technical personnel and workers, and combining theory and practice to design and trial-produce automobiles under China's current conditions. Design personnel expressed that they would change the practice of only turning pages in books and doing calculations in the office and that they must go to the workshops to absorb the experience of the working masses in order to improve designs and then more effectively guide production and serve production.

    According to the needs of the Great Leap Forward, the conference organized cooperation in design work, striving to complete the design and production of three series of automobiles, including trucks, buses, and sedans, by next year. This includes large trucks with a load capacity of sixty tons, as well as micro, light, medium, and high-end sedans, in order to meet the needs of the national economy to the greatest extent.

    全国汽车设计人员大集会
    批判重“洋”轻“土”思想
    据新华社长春24日电　记者康国志报道：第一机械工业部第六局最近在第一汽车制造厂召开了全国汽车设计会议。
    会议反映了我国汽车工业大跃进的新形势，促使人们解放设计思想，打破制造汽车的神秘观点，采取“土”“洋”并举的办法推动全国汽车工业大步向前发展。
    这个会议是全国汽车设计工作人员史无前例的大集会。参加会议的有汽车制造厂，汽车修配厂，机械厂，以及汽车工业研究机关、高等学校、省市工业交通部门等近六十个单位的代表。会议着重交流了二十多项土办法、洋办法和土洋结合办法设计、试制汽车的经验，并且解决了在当前跃进形势下出现的一些新问题。
    全国汽车工业是在不断克服保守思想、教条主义的束缚中获得发展的。到目前为止，除了第一汽车厂以外，还有四十多个工厂生产了好几十种载重卡车、公共汽车和轿车，其中大多数工厂都是规模简陋的汽车修配厂。这些小厂有着许多丰富的设计和试制汽车的土办法、土经验值得重视。这些办法和经验是集中了各厂工人的智慧和干劲创造出来的。这些厂在做法上的共同点是，从本厂具体条件出发，面对实际，依靠群众，解决汽车设计、试制中的问题；在这一工作中大胆地进行新的尝试，不受任何规章制度和书本知识的限制。这些工厂的老工人多年修理汽车，经验丰富。他们特别熟悉各种汽车的优缺点，以及零件加工方法。因此，其中大部分工厂都没有画一张图纸，只利用简单的设备和手工操作，就把汽车制成，洛阳汽车保养厂就是利用全厂仅有的四部机床，在六天之内制出一部汽车。这部汽车的设计特点是：体小、灵便、爬坡力强，马车能通过的农村道路，它都能通过；使用汽油、煤炭都可以，燃料来源方便，可以运输，又可以作动力机械使用。这种汽车正是有的科学研究部门长期以来所要设计而还没有设计成功的。
    会议通过交流经验，使小厂学到了设计汽车的“洋”办法，大厂学到了“土”办法，进一步明确了在我国目前条件下，采用土洋结合、技术人员和工人结合、理论和实际结合等方法设计和试制汽车的重要意义。设计人员们表示要改变光在办公室翻书本、作计算的作法，必须到车间去吸取工人群众的经验，以便改进设计，再去更有效地指导生产，为生产服务。
    会议根据大跃进的需要，组织了设计工作的协作，争取在明年完成我国载重卡车、公共汽车、轿车等三种系列汽车的设计和生产，其中包括载重量六十吨的大型载重卡车，以及微型、轻型、中型和高级的轿车等等，以便最大程度地满足国民经济的需要。
