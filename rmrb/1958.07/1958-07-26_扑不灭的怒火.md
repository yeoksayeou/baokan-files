Unquenchable Fury

Lebanon and Jordan are both small countries. The US and British imperialists thought that as long as they sent in their troops to show their power, the people there would obediently lie down under the aggressors' iron heels. However, the imperialists' arrogant estimation was completely wrong. It is no longer the era when "gunboat diplomacy" could run rampant in previous centuries. Although Lebanon and Jordan have small territories, the Arab people's determination to fight for independence and freedom and oppose colonialism is unbreakable. The US and British imperialists who invaded Lebanon and Jordan have aroused even greater indignation and resistance from the people.

In Lebanon, the soldiers of the American invading army have had enough experience to prove that Eisenhower's statement that "you are invited there as friends" is a great irony. The Lebanese people greeted these self-proclaimed "friends" and "protectors of freedom and independence" not with laughter, but with hatred; not with flowers, but with explosives in soda bottles; not with gratitude, but with cold shots and bullets from snipers. Feeling guilty, the US military became disturbed and repeatedly made "mistakes," killing their own soldiers as rebels, and even opening fire on Chamoun's police force. On the streets of Beirut, patriots distributed leaflets condemning "the American robbers for concentrating their fleets and planes and landing in this peaceful country to strangle the people's sacred uprising," calling on "men, women, and children to immediately take up arms, use your submachine guns, rifles, pistols, and grenades to hit them, and bite them to pieces with your teeth. Make it impossible for them to live and impossible to survive." It is worth pointing out that even the original pro-Western social figures have now turned to an anti-American stance due to the landing of American troops. They also call the American troops occupying forces and demand their immediate withdrawal.

In Jordan, the people saw the British troops who had been driven out by themselves returning. That is why, despite the British troops' invasion and Hussein's brutal suppression, people's masses in various places held demonstrations and strikes to oppose the traitorous monarchy and the British invaders. Jordanian patriots distributed leaflets on the 24th, calling on the people to fight the British occupying forces. To the point that King Hussein, who was hated by the people, felt that it was not enough to have British soldiers protect the palace, and repeatedly demanded that American invading forces enter Jordan.

The so-called "invited" mask of the US and British imperialists invading Lebanon and Jordan to protect "freedom" and "independence" can no longer deceive people. US imperialism has become the head of colonialism in front of the whole world, a naked aggressor and war maker, and the common enemy of the Middle Eastern people and all peace-loving people. The US imperialists themselves are now beginning to feel that their adventurous actions have miscalculated. As the US "Wall Street Journal" editorial admitted: "No one close to the White House or the State Department initially imagined that our actions would cause the kind of reaction that Lebanon is now causing." The United States has fallen into complete moral bankruptcy due to its invasion of the Middle East. Not only has "a storm of criticism swept through West Germany, Japan, and Sweden, but even our closest allies, the Canadians, are feeling very uneasy." So isolated internationally, and in Lebanon and Jordan, they are on the crater of popular resistance. That is why, while continuing to gather troops in the Near and Middle East, the US and British imperialists have intensified their political conspiracies, plotting to divide and disintegrate the forces of the Middle Eastern people's anti-aggression struggle.

Recently, American conspirator Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy, in the name of the President's special political representative, has been conducting intense activities in Lebanon, contacting representatives of various Lebanese parties, attempting to coerce the opposition parties to accept the American plan under the bayonets of the American occupying forces, and have the current parliament controlled by the Chamoun group "elect" an American-picked "president." In addition, Murphy also wants to use the US and British military threats to carry out other conspiracies among the Arab people.

Imperialists have always adopted various means to realize their ambitions of aggression, military, political, economic, and cultural. But no matter how cunning and insidious the imperialists are, they cannot conceal their ferocious colonialist face. Murphy's conspiracy activities in Lebanon also cannot deceive the broad masses of the people. The people of Lebanon and Jordan, like the awakened Arab people as a whole, have recognized the true face of imperialism from their long suffering, especially from this US and British intervention. They realize that the imperialists who have no just cause and are deserted by all are not terrible. As long as they unite, arm themselves, and fight to the end, they will surely be able to defeat any conspiracy of the imperialists and strive for and safeguard national independence and freedom. The struggle of the Egyptian and Syrian people in 1956 and 1957 was an example, and the struggle of the Iraqi people in 1958 is another example. The Republic of Iraq has now been recognized by twenty-two countries and has formed a common defense line with the United Arab Republic. Thousands of patriots across Iraq have signed up to join the volunteer army, and thousands of residents in Talakia, Syria, have applied to be volunteers. Five hundred thousand people in the United Arab Republic held a rally in Cairo's Republic Square to oppose the American aggression against Lebanon and Jordan and support the Republic of Iraq. The imperialists' plan to intimidate the Iraqi people has failed, and the imperialists' plan to intimidate the Lebanese and Jordanian people will inevitably fail. The history of social development always tells people: the oppressed, weak, but representative of the people and progressive forces will surely defeat those seemingly powerful and temporarily dominant forces. Now, although the people of Lebanon and Jordan are facing a serious struggle to expel the US and British aggressors, as long as the United States and Britain do not withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan, the flame of the Arab people's struggle for freedom, independence, and survival will never be extinguished. The Iraq of today will be the Lebanon and Jordan of tomorrow! The banner of national liberation will surely triumph, and imperialism and reactionary forces will surely be eliminated by the people!

### 扑不灭的怒火

    扑不灭的怒火
    黎巴嫩和约旦都是小国，在美英帝国主义者的眼里，满以为只要把大军一开上去，显示一下威力，那里的人民就会服服贴贴地躺在侵略者的铁蹄之下了。可是，帝国主义者狂妄的估计，完全错了。现在，已经再不是前几世纪可以靠“炮舰政策”横行的时代了。黎巴嫩和约旦国土虽小，但是，阿拉伯人争取独立自由、反对殖民主义的斗志，却是不可屈的。侵入黎巴嫩和约旦的美英帝国主义者，激起了人民更大的义愤和反抗。
    在黎巴嫩，美国侵略军的士兵们，已经有了足够的经验，来证明艾森豪威尔所讲的“你们是应他们邀请作为朋友到那里去的”云云不过是一个极大的讽刺。黎巴嫩人民接待这批自命为“朋友”和“自由独立的保护者”，不是欢笑，而是仇恨；不是鲜花，而是装在汽水瓶里的爆炸物；不是感激，而是冷枪冷弹的狙击。作贼心虚，弄得美军心神不安，接连发生“误会”，把自己的士兵当成了起义人民打死了，还同夏蒙的警察部队开了火。在贝鲁特街头，爱国者散发着这样的传单，谴责“美国强盗在这个和平的国家集结了他们的舰队和飞机并且进行登陆，来扼杀人民神圣的起义”，号召“男人们、妇女们、儿童们，立即拿起武器来，用你们的手提机关枪、步枪、手枪和手榴弹打他们，用你们的牙齿把他们咬碎。叫他们无法生活和不能生活”。值得特别指出的是，就是甚至原来的亲西方的社会人士，现在也由于美国军队的登陆而转入反美的立场，他们也把美国军队称为占领军，要求他们立即撤退。
    在约旦，人民看到了曾经被自己赶出去的英国的军队重新回来了。这就是为什么不顾英军的侵入，侯赛因的野蛮镇压，各地人民群众举行示威和罢工，反对卖国王朝，反对英国侵略者。约旦爱国者24日散发传单，号召人民同英国占领军作战。以致使得那个为人民所痛恨的国王侯赛因，请来了英国兵保护王宫还感到不够安宁，一次又一次地还要求美国侵略军开进约旦。
    美英帝国主义者侵入黎巴嫩和约旦的所谓被“邀请”去保护“自由”和“独立”的假面具，现在再也骗不了人了。美帝国主义已在全世界面前成为殖民主义的首脑，成为赤裸裸的侵略者和战争制造者，成为中东人民和一切爱好和平的人民的公敌。美帝国主义者自己现在开始感到他们的冒险行动是打错了算盘了。正像美国“华尔街日报”社论中所承认的：“接近白宫或国务院的人士中没有一个人当初能够设想到我们的行动会引起现在黎巴嫩所引起的那种反应。”美国由于侵略中东，在道义上已陷于完全破产的地步。不只是“在西德、日本和瑞典已经掀起了一阵批评的风暴。甚至我们最亲密的盟友加拿大人也感到很不安。”在国际上如此孤立，而在黎巴嫩和约旦，他们又处在人民反抗的火山口上。这就是为什么美英帝国主义继续在中近东集结军队的同时，加紧了政治的阴谋活动，策划着分化和瓦解中东人民的反侵略斗争的力量。
    最近以来，美国的阴谋家副国务卿帮办墨菲，就以总统特派政治代表的名义，在黎巴嫩进行了紧张的活动，同黎巴嫩各党派的代表接触，企图在美国占领军的刺刀下，诱胁反对党派接受美国计划，由夏蒙集团所操纵的现议会，“选出”一个美国挑选的“总统”。除此以外，墨菲还想利用美英的武力威胁，在阿拉伯人民中间进行其他的阴谋活动。
    帝国主义者实现自己侵略的野心，从来就是采取各种各样的手段，军事的、政治的、经济的、文化的，应有尽有。但是不管帝国主义者多么狡猾和毒辣，却掩盖不住它的殖民主义者凶恶的面目。墨菲在黎巴嫩的阴谋活动，同样也骗不了广大人民。黎巴嫩和约旦人民，同已经觉醒了的全体阿拉伯人民一样，从长期的苦难中，特别是从这一次的美英干涉中，认清了帝国主义的真面目。他们认识到：师出无名和众叛亲离的帝国主义者并没有什么可怕，只要团结起来，武装起来，斗争到底，就一定能够打败帝国主义的任何阴谋诡计，争取和维护民族的独立和自由。埃及人民和叙利亚人民在1956年和1957年的斗争是一个榜样，伊拉克人民在1958年的斗争又是一个榜样。伊拉克共和国到现在为止，已经获得二十二个国家的承认，并且已经同阿联结成了共同防御战线。伊拉克全国有数以千计的爱国者报名参加了志愿兵，叙利亚塔拉基亚有几千居民申请当志愿军。阿联五十万人在开罗共和国广场举行大会，反对美国侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，支持伊拉克共和国。帝国主义企图吓倒伊拉克人民的计划已经破产，帝国主义企图吓倒黎巴嫩和约旦人民的计划也必然破产。社会发展的历史总是这样告诉人们的：被压迫的、弱小的但是代表人民和进步的力量，一定会战胜那些貌似强大而暂时居于统治地位的力量。现在，黎巴嫩和约旦的人民虽然面临着驱逐美英侵略者的严重斗争，但是只要一天美国和英国不把军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，阿拉伯人民争取自由、独立和生存的烈火，就是永远扑不灭的。伊拉克的今天，就将是黎巴嫩和约旦的明天！民族自由的旗帜必将胜利，帝国主义和反动势力必将为人民所消灭！
