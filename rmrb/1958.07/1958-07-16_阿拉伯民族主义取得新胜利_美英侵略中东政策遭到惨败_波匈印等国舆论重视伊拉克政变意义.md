Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 15th: Polish newspapers today published commentaries on the victory of the Iraqi coup.

    "People's Tribune's" commentary pointed out that Iraq was the only Arab nation among the member states of the Baghdad Pact. The coup in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, dealt a heavy blow to the West's most sensitive point. This event signifies the bankruptcy of the strategic system based on the Baghdad Pact and opens a new stage in the anti-colonialist struggle.

    The commentary emphasized that any foreign intervention would create a major conflict in the region. The Iraqi coup, whether others like it or not, is an internal affair of that country.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 15th: Romania's "Spark" and "Free Romania" both published commentaries today evaluating the victory of the Iraqi coup.

    "Spark's" commentary pointed out that the Iraqi event once again demonstrates that the Arab people's national liberation movement is entering a climax. This coup marks another new eruption of the people's long-term opposition to imperialist exploitation and oppression. The Iraqi event is a new failure for the Eisenhower-Dulles doctrine.

    "Free Romania's" commentary pointed out that the Iraqi event is an even greater blow to imperialism than the Suez Canal incident. This is because Iraq is not only an important source of income for British and American capitalists in terms of oil, but it has also recently been the most important pillar of imperialism in this region.

    The newspaper's commentary also said that the Iraqi event occurring two months after the Lebanese incident has particularly important significance, because this shows that the Arab people can no longer tolerate imperialist exploitation.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 15th: Hungary's "People's Freedom Daily" today published on its front page with large headlines detailed news of the armed coup in Iraq and the declaration of the establishment of the Republic of Iraq. The newspaper also published a commentary, emphasizing that this event is yet another serious blow to British and American imperialism.

    The commentary said that the Iraqi event will certainly affect the overall situation in the Middle East, strengthen the courage of the Lebanese insurgents, and Jordan will soon use armed uprisings to overthrow the pro-Western puppet government.

    The commentary concluded by pointing out that it is foreseeable that the American and British imperialists will soon carry out conspiracies to interfere in the situation in Iraq. But it is certain that this interference will be detrimental to them, because it will inevitably cause an anti-imperialist upsurge throughout the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, July 15th: The Bulgarian people warmly congratulate the Iraqi people and army on their victory in the struggle against imperialism and for national freedom and independence. All central newspapers published commentaries today.

    "Workers' Affairs" pointed out that the merits of the Iraqi people and the patriots of the Iraqi army will have a very large positive impact on the anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist national liberation struggle of the entire Arab world. The Iraqi people have dealt a heavy blow to the aggressive American "Eisenhower-Dulles doctrine," causing the imperialist military aggression plan in the Near and Middle East to suffer a serious defeat.

    "Fatherland Front" said in a commentary that the Iraqi event is a serious warning to the imperialists, who should understand that the era of colonialism is gone forever. It is especially necessary at a time when some hotheads in the West are clamoring for military intervention in the Arab world.

    "People's Army" emphasized that the people of all countries should remain vigilant in order to stop any attempt by the imperialists to interfere in Iraq's internal affairs at any time.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 15th: Slovakia's "Truth Daily" wrote in a commentary today that the coup in Iraq is a heavy blow to Western imperialists and their most loyal servants.

    The commentary said that the colonialists believed that Iraq was their strongest fortress in the Near and Middle East. This coup will further frustrate the imperialists' conspiracy to use the Baghdad Pact to cover up their interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 15th: Today, all newspapers in the Indian capital published news of the Iraqi coup on the front page. Editorials in the newspapers called the coup a victory for Arab nationalism and said it was a fatal blow to the Baghdad Pact.

    "The Times of India" warned Western countries that if they do not recognize Arab nationalism, "they cannot even salvage the little goodwill and understanding they have left in the Arab world." The newspaper pointed out that "it is no accident that the flames of Arab nationalism have been burning all the way to the base of the Baghdad Pact." The newspaper also warned that "if the West rashly undertakes any suicidal intervention, it will unite the entire Arab world," so "the West has no other option but to bury the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 15th: Jakarta's "Independence Daily" published an editorial today on the Iraqi armed coup, saying that the events in Iraq are an internal affair. If foreign countries interfere, it will have far-reaching consequences.

    The newspaper pointed out that the downfall of the Said government shows that the sun of Western countries, especially Britain, in Iraq has set. This event also dealt a heavy blow to the Baghdad Pact.

    阿拉伯民族主义取得新胜利  美英侵略中东政策遭到惨败
    波匈印等国舆论重视伊拉克政变意义
    新华社华沙15日电　波兰报纸今天就伊拉克政变的胜利发表了评论。
    “人民论坛报”的评论指出，伊拉克是巴格达条约成员国中唯一的阿拉伯国家。伊拉克首都巴格达政变给了西方最敏感的痛处一个沉重的打击。这个事件意味着以巴格达条约为依据的战略系统的破产，开辟了反殖民主义斗争的新阶段。
    评论强调说，任何的外国干涉都会在这一地区造成很大的冲突。伊拉克政变不管他人喜欢与否，都是这个国家的内政问题。
    据新华社布加勒斯特15日电　罗马尼亚“火花报”和“自由罗马尼亚报”今天都发表评论，评伊拉克的政变胜利。
    “火花报”的评论指出，伊拉克事件又一次表明阿拉伯人民的民族解放运动正在进入高潮。这次政变标志着长期以来人民反对帝国主义剥削和压迫的又一次新的爆发。伊拉克事件是艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯主义的一个新的失败。
    “自由罗马尼亚报”评论指出，伊拉克事件，比苏伊士运河事件对帝国主义的打击还要大。因为伊拉克不仅在石油方面是英美资本家的收入的重要来源，而且近来它是帝国主义在这个地区最重要的支柱。
    这家报纸的评论又说，伊拉克事件发生在黎巴嫩事件两个月以后有特别重要的意义。因为这表明阿拉伯人民不能够再容忍帝国主义的剥削了。
    据新华社布达佩斯15日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”今天在第一版以大字标题详细刊登了伊拉克发生武装政变和宣布成立伊拉克共和国的消息。这家报纸同时还发表了一篇评论，它强调指出这个事件是对英、美帝国主义的又一次严重的打击。
    评论说，伊拉克事件一定会影响到整个中东的局势，会加强黎巴嫩起义者的勇气，约旦也将很快地用武装起义来推翻亲西方的傀儡政府。
    评论最后指出，可以预料，最近美、英帝国主义者将进行阴谋活动，干涉伊拉克的局势。但是可以肯定，这种干涉对他们将是不利的，因为这样就不可避免地会在整个中东地区引起反帝国主义的高潮。
    新华社索非亚15日电　保加利亚人民热烈祝贺伊拉克人民和军队在反对帝国主义、争取祖国自由和独立的斗争中取得的胜利。各中央报纸今天都发表了评论。
    “工人事业报”指出，伊拉克人民和伊拉克军队的爱国者的功绩，将对整个阿拉伯世界的反殖民主义和反帝国主义的民族解放斗争产生非常大的积极影响。伊拉克人民给了美国侵略性的“艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯主义”以沉重的打击，使帝国主义在中近东的军事侵略计划遭到了严重的失败。
    “祖国阵线报”在评论中说，伊拉克事件对于帝国主义者是一个严重的警告，帝国主义者应当懂得，殖民主义的时代已经一去不复返了。在目前，当西方某些头脑发热的人正在叫嚷对阿拉伯进行军事干涉的时候就尤其必要。
    “人民军报”强调指出，各国人民应该保持警惕，以便随时制止帝国主义者干涉伊拉克内政的任何企图。
    据新华社布拉格15日电　斯洛伐克的“真理报”今天在一篇评论中写道，伊拉克的政变对于西方帝国主义者和他们的最忠实的仆从说来是一个沉重的打击。
    评论说，殖民者认为伊拉克是他们在中近东最强大的堡垒。这次政变将进一步挫败帝国主义者利用巴格达条约来掩盖他们干涉黎巴嫩内政的阴谋。
    据新华社新德里15日电　今天印度首都各报都在第一版登载了伊拉克政变的消息。各报在社论中称这次政变是阿拉伯民族主义的胜利，并说这是对巴格达条约的致命打击。
    “印度时报”警告西方国家说，如果它们不承认阿拉伯民族主义，“它们甚至不能挽救它们在阿拉伯世界所残留的一点点善意和谅解”。这家报纸指出，“阿拉伯民族主义的怒火已经一直烧到巴格达条约的根据地，这并不是意外。”这家报纸还警告说，“如果西方竟然轻率地进行自杀性的任何干涉行动的冒险的话，都会使整个阿拉伯世界联合起来”，因此“西方除了埋葬巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义外再没有别的办法”。
    新华社雅加达15日电　雅加达“独立报”今天就伊拉克武装政变发表社论说，伊拉克发生的事件是内政问题。如果外国进行干涉的话，就会产生深远的影响。
    这家报纸指出，赛义德政府的倒台表明，西方国家的，特别是英国在伊拉克的太阳已经落下了。这件事也给予巴格达条约以沉重的打击。
