Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 20th: The literary and art circles in Guangzhou have been fully mobilized to use various literary weapons to denounce the aggressive acts of American and British imperialism and support the just struggle of the people of the Middle Eastern countries.

Poets and writers, upon hearing the news of the American invasion of Lebanon, immediately took up literary weapons to fight. Writer Wang Qi was extremely angry at the imperialist aggression and wrote a new poem: "Six hundred million iron fists support you, Lebanese brothers, be bold and daring! Six hundred million iron fists support you! American imperialism is just a paper tiger. We peeled its skin off on the Korean battlefield. Today, the world situation is very different. The east wind prevails over the west wind. The people of Asia and Africa are united and powerful, kicking American imperialism out of the Middle East with one foot!" Yesterday morning, the Guangzhou branch of the Writers Association printed the newly written eighteen poems by the poets as materials for publicizing the crimes of imperialist aggression to the broad masses of the people.

Painters collaborated on a series of posters on the morning of the 17th to support the just struggle of the people of Lebanon and Iraq. Street poetry and art exhibitions are also scheduled to be held within days. Musicians Lu Zhongren, Huang Jinpei, and others wrote a series of new songs condemning American and British imperialism and supporting the people of Lebanon and Iraq.

The Guangzhou Cantonese opera circles are also taking practical actions to support the struggle of the Lebanese and Iraqi people for national independence. Famous Cantonese opera actress Bai Juyi indignantly recited a dragon boat song, "People's Indignation," at a Cantonese opera circle protest meeting. In addition to writing poems to warn American and British imperialism, Hong Xiannu, along with Chu Xiuyun and others, sang new Cantonese operas supporting the just struggle of the people of Lebanon and Iraq at theaters and radio stations on the evening of the 19th. Many Cantonese opera actors also went to the streets to perform. (Attached picture)

    拿起文艺武器作战
    广州文艺界声援阿拉伯人民
    新华社广州20日电  广州市文艺界人士已经全面动员起来，利用各种文艺武器声讨美、英帝国主义的侵略行为，声援中东各国人民的正义斗争。
    诗人、作家在得到美国侵略黎巴嫩的消息后，便立即拿起文艺武器进行战斗，作家王起对帝国主义的侵略行为极为愤怒，他写了一首新诗：“六亿双铁拳支持你，黎巴嫩兄弟大胆干，六亿双铁拳支持你，美帝国主义是只纸老虎，我们曾在朝鲜战场剥了它的皮，今天世界形势大不同，东风呼喇压倒西风，亚非人民团结力量大，把美帝一脚踢出中近东。”昨天上午，作协广州分会把诗人们新写成的十八首诗稿付印，作为向广大人民宣传反对帝国主义侵略罪行的材料。
    画家们在17日上午合作了一批招贴画，支持黎巴嫩、伊拉克人民的正义斗争。街头诗、画展览会也决定在日内举行。音乐家陆仲任、黄锦培等写了一批新歌曲，谴责美、英帝国主义，支援黎巴嫩和伊拉克人民。
    广州粤剧界也以实际行动声援黎巴嫩，伊拉克人民争取民族独立的斗争。著名粤剧演员白驹荣义愤填膺地在粤剧界抗议集会上朗诵了一首龙舟：“人民义愤”。红线女除了写诗警告美、英帝国主义外，并在19日晚和楚岫云等分别到剧场、电台演唱声援黎巴嫩和伊拉克人民正义斗争的新粤剧，许多粤剧演员还到街头去演唱。（附图片）
