In Jiangsu Province, large-scale high-yield green manure examples have emerged.

In the Qianliu Agricultural Cooperative, Daitou Township, Changshu County, thirteen mu of red clover achieved a single-mu yield as high as 29,400 jin.

In Fengxian County, over 140,000 mu of green manure averaged 11,060 jin of fresh grass per mu, including 13,200 mu with a single-mu yield of over 15,000 jin, and 146 mu with a single-mu yield of over 17,000 jin.  At the same time, the county's trial planting of 30,000 mu of spring green manure was also successful, with a single-mu yield of approximately 2,000 jin.

The two-plus mu of hairy vetch field cultivated by the No. 1 Social Team, No. 4 Team, in Baijia Township, Dagang District, Yancheng County, actually yielded nearly 20,000 jin per mu.

In Wangzhuang Township, Liyang County, over 7,000 mu of red clover averaged 11,000 jin per mu.  The peasants reflected, saying, "Growing green manure is really energetic; it's like opening a big fertilizer factory on the land!"

The high yields of green manure in various places are mainly due to grasping the measures of rational crop rotation, timely sowing, dense planting, ensuring full stands, ensuring safe overwintering of seedlings, timely topdressing, using fertilizer to nurture fertilizer, ditching for drainage, and drought resistance to protect seedlings.

    江苏出现大面积绿肥高产
    本报讯　江苏省出现了大面积绿肥高产的事例。
    常熟县埭头乡前六农业社有十三亩红花草，每亩单产高达二万九千四百斤。
    奉贤县有十四万多亩绿肥平均每亩产鲜草一万一千零六十斤，其中单产在一万五千斤以上的有一万三千二百亩，单产一万七千斤以上的有一百四十六亩，同时，全县试种的三万亩春绿肥也获得成功，每亩单产在二千斤左右。
    盐城县大冈区柏家一社四队培植的二亩多苕子田，每亩单产实收近二万斤。
    溧阳县王庄乡七千多亩红花草，每亩平均产量一万一千斤。农民反映说：“种绿肥真来劲，大地上开了个大肥料厂。”
    各地绿肥取得高额产量，主要是抓住了合理安排茬口，适时播种，进行密植，保证全苗，保证幼苗安全过冬，适时追肥，以肥养肥，开沟排水，抗旱保苗等措施。（附图片）
