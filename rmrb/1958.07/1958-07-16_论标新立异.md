    On Being Unconventional
    Wang Shihao
    Being unconventional has always been a term with satirical and dismissive connotations. The mention of being unconventional immediately brings to mind "showing off" and "overestimating one's abilities," among other things. Therefore, people consciously or unconsciously become opponents of being unconventional.
    Whether being unconventional should be opposed cannot be generalized. Being unconventional towards Marxism-Leninism and the Party's policies, or so-called "new" and "different" ideas that are like those of right-wing elements, who reverse black and white and distort facts, should be resolutely opposed. However, a completely different attitude should be taken towards new and different viewpoints in science.
    Being unconventional is the opposite of tradition. So-called traditional viewpoints are those generally considered correct. It is entirely necessary for later generations of scientists to respect the achievements of their predecessors, understand the power and significance of scientific tradition, and be good at utilizing these traditions for the benefit of science. However, one must never be satisfied with learning from past experiences and inheriting old culture, and even less can one lie on books and live off the conclusions of others. Due to the limitations of conditions, some of the arguments of older scientists may be wrong; even if some arguments are correct, they become increasingly outdated with the progress of the times and hinder the further development of science. We must never regard traditional viewpoints as immutable and sacrosanct. On the contrary, our task is to replace outdated traditional viewpoints that hinder scientific progress with new viewpoints based on the further development of science, thereby opening up new avenues for scientific development.
    The universal law of the development of things, that there is no eternal truth in the world, and that everything changes according to conditions, location, and time, has been proven by the entire history of scientific development. The idea that the Earth is the center of the universe was once considered a correct viewpoint, and for more than a thousand years, no one dared to touch it. But it was not the truth. Copernicus replaced the Earth-centered theory with the sun-centered theory, promoting the development of science. The immutability of species was also once considered correct by many, but the publication of Darwin's theory of evolution fundamentally negated this fallacy, changing people's understanding of natural and social development. In the eyes of previous scientists, the atom could not be split, but the development of science has proven that breaking the atomic nucleus is entirely possible, which has opened up a broad space for the further development of science.
    The development of science is endless. When a certain old and outdated traditional viewpoint is universally abandoned by mankind, and a certain new viewpoint is universally accepted, newer viewpoints will be put forward based on the further development of science to replace the new viewpoints. This is the general law of scientific development. However, the establishment of new viewpoints is not always smooth sailing. Because no matter when, there are always some people who are not good at thinking and cling to old and outdated traditional arguments. As soon as new arguments appear, they are considered to have overstepped the norm and are labeled with the crime of "being unconventional" and subjected to verbal attacks. Especially those old ruling classes, who are afraid that this will shake their ruling position. Historically, there are countless examples of new viewpoints being suppressed and attacked. When Copernicus's heliocentric theory was put forward, most people ridiculed him as a madman, believing that his theory was heresy. The medieval church sent the courageous thinker Bruno to the stake because he promoted and developed Copernicus's heliocentric theory. They also tried the old scientist Galileo, convicting him of "being contrary to philosophy and the Bible, and obviously heresy," and passed a resolution prohibiting the dissemination of Copernicus's theory. However, the fact that the Earth is a small ball in the boundless universe cannot be prohibited by any resolution. When Darwin's theory of evolution was published, this theory was greatly attacked by religious and moral figures, and was denounced as "heresy." The "British Association for the Advancement of Science" at Oxford University in England, under the leadership of Bishop Wilberforce, held a massive Savior’s assembly, putting forward the slogans of "Save souls, overthrow evolution" and "Down with Darwin." American pastors also loudly called for opposition to Darwin. However, the fact is that it was precisely because of this "heresy" that religious delusions were broken, old ideas were overturned, and the development of science was promoted. When Marx and Engels established scientific Marxism, the reactionary classes and their hired scholars also denounced it as heresy and persecuted it in every possible way. However, facts have proved that Marxism is the truth that can thoroughly liberate mankind. In our history, there are also many such examples. In old China, anyone who dared to question the traditional Confucian doctrines was invariably persecuted or even beheaded with the charge of "deviating from the scriptures and rebelling against orthodoxy" and "heresy." After Marxism-Leninism was introduced into China, all reactionary rulers once regarded it as a "raging flood" and repeatedly ordered it to be banned. However, Marxism-Leninism still took root and sprouted on Chinese soil and became the guiding ideology for the Chinese people to seek liberation. Truth will surely triumph, and history is written in this way.
    Newborn forces are invincible. This is the absolute law of the development of things. However, the struggle between the new and the old, the struggle in which the new forces overcome the resistance of the old forces and finally achieve victory, does not proceed in a straight line, but develops through twists and turns after arduous struggles. In science, new arguments that open up a broad space for the further development of science are established only after arduous struggles. In order to break the resistance of conservative forces and establish new scientific theories, scientific warriors are needed who can fight for the truth regardless of everything, who can oppose outdated principles without fear of any obstacles, and who can open up new paths for the new development of science. The founder of Marxism, Marx, was "the most hated and most slandered person" in his lifetime. He was repeatedly expelled from the country by the governments of capitalist countries and had almost no place to live. The bourgeoisie all rushed to slander and curse him. However, Marx ignored these things. He brushed them all aside like cobwebs and continued on his own path. Based on his research on capitalism in the era of imperialism, Lenin put forward new conclusions suitable for the new historical environment regarding the possibility of socialist revolution winning in a single country to replace the outdated conclusions reached by Marx and Engels in their study of free capitalism that socialist revolution could not win in a single country, thereby advancing Marxist theory. At that time, Plekhanov believed that Lenin was "daydreaming," and many other famous figures in the Russian scientific community also said that he was a destroyer of science. However, Lenin marched straight ahead regardless of everything. Facts proved that Lenin was right. Marx and Lenin were both models of scientific warriors who boldly fought against outdated science and opened up paths for new science. After the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, all the reactionary rulers used cruel methods of "killing without pardon" to deal with the Communists, and even launched large-scale wars to oppose the people's revolutionary movement. The heroic Communists firmly believed that the communist system would definitely be realized in China, and resolutely fought against all reactionary forces, finally overthrowing the rule of the domestic and foreign reactionaries and establishing a democratic, free, independent, and prosperous new socialist China.
    Being unconventional is the opposite of blind obedience and conservatism, and it is the harbinger of breaking old traditions, old conclusions, and producing new conclusions. To break old theories and establish new theories, in addition to having the courage to fight for the truth regardless of any obstacles and regardless of everything, one must also have originality. To be original, one must break with superstition, liberate one's mind, and dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. As long as it is not wild fantasy, but has a certain scientific basis, the ideal will definitely be realized. People wanted to go to the sky, so they invented airplanes and rockets; people wanted to have clairvoyance, so they created television and radio facsimile; people wanted to have keen hearing, so radio broadcasting and radios appeared. All of these were thought of and done by people. If people were bound by tradition and dared not think about anything outside of tradition, then the world would forever remain in a state of ignorance and would not enter today's atomic age. Under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the General Line, the liberated Chinese working people are breaking all superstitions and implementing a comprehensive Great Leap Forward with the force of a thunderbolt. Inventors and technical innovators are emerging in large numbers. New inventions, creations and technical innovations are like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and good news is frequently reported, with several occurring in a single day. We must do things that predecessors have not done, we must do things that foreigners dare not do, and we must create things that are not found in books. This revolutionary initiative to dare to break old theories and establish new theories fully demonstrates that once people's minds are liberated from the shackles of traditional viewpoints, they can accomplish earth-shattering things.
    Those who dare to break old theories and create new ones, and who open up new paths in science and technology, are often not famous figures in the scientific community, but often ordinary people, practitioners, and work innovators who are not famous at all in the scientific community. Their new arguments may initially be incomplete or merely exploratory. Therefore, they should not be simply negated because they are not comprehensive enough or because they have certain errors, but should be given support and help. Only with full support and help can "miracles" appear in science. Tsiolkovsky, a Russian middle school teacher who later became a great scholar, invented the metal airship with the help of physicist Stoletov and aviation expert Zhukovsky, opening the door for mankind to fly out of the Earth. Madame Curie, with the encouragement of Mr. Curie, discovered a method of extracting the radioactive element radium, opening up new avenues for modern science. Wang Xuerui, an old worker at the Nanchengji Flour Mill in Jinan City, made a wheat peeling machine with the help of everyone, opening the prelude to technological innovation in the flour milling industry. Xu Agui, a carpenter at the Shanghai Huaheng Dyestuff Factory, created a leap-forward rotary screen with the support of the Party, fundamentally solving the problem of dust flying, which had always been considered unsolvable by experts. Liang Shukai, a young technician at the Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory, with the encouragement and support of the Party committee, successfully experimented with the "myth" of dyeing silk without dyes, which was considered "fanciful," breaking the concept of technical mystery and shaking the outdated theories in books and the statutory process regulations. Zhou Hanhua, a young peasant in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, with the support of the Party branch, successfully experimented with "distant hybridization" of rice and sorghum, breaking the long-term superstition in the scientific community and opening up new paradigms for cultivating fine varieties. The technical innovation movement that is currently booming throughout the country eloquently proves that under the encouragement and support of the Party, the liberated Chinese working people are fully capable of creating unprecedented miracles.
    In socialist society, the conditions for the growth of new things are fundamentally different from the past. However, the suppression of new forces and the suppression of reasonable opinions still exist. Some people with conservative ideas tend to adopt a viewpoint that everyone considers correct and never give it up for a lifetime. They do not take a cautious attitude towards new arguments that oppose the so-called correct viewpoint, but hastily oppose them. They do not take the method of free discussion and practice in the scientific community to solve them, but simply prohibit them. They do not take a supportive attitude but a suppressive attitude. When new arguments are put forward, they always first open the book to see if predecessors have already said it. They take an opposing attitude to everything that is not in the book. When Long Wenzhong, a construction worker in Wuhan City, was studying the electric grout extrusion wall-building machine, some people thought that this was something that foreign experts had studied for many years without success, and affirmed that this worker, who "can't even draw a blueprint," could not succeed. When the young peasant Yang Chaoheng proposed using a new method to cultivate sugarcane, he was strongly opposed by sugarcane experts, who believed that this was not in the book and was "contrary to the laws of science." After the National Agricultural Development Program was put forward, some people believed that agricultural production could not grow rapidly. They quoted classics and proved that the development of agriculture could only be slow and could not be guaranteed. Facts have proved that these people are all mental lazybones who live off the conclusions of others.
    In the report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao pointed out: "Different forms and styles in art can develop freely, and different schools of thought in science can contend freely. We believe that using administrative power to forcibly promote one style or one school of thought and prohibiting another style or another school of thought will be harmful to the development of art and science. The rights and wrongs in art and science should be resolved through free discussions in the art and scientific communities, and through the practice of art and science, and should not be resolved by simple methods." "We should maintain a cautious attitude towards the rights and wrongs in science and art, advocate free discussion, and not draw conclusions rashly. We believe that adopting this attitude can help science and art to develop more smoothly." This is the policy that should be adopted towards scientific work.
    The development of science is the result of the debate of different opinions. Without the mutual war of different opinions, science will not develop. The emergence of new and different viewpoints should be welcomed by us. If it is wrong, then let the traditional viewpoint defeat the new viewpoint; if it is correct, then let it defeat the traditional viewpoint. Only through great blooming, great contending, and great debate can we distinguish right from wrong and make science advance. Without the new and the different, science will not develop and society will not progress. It is generally incorrect to oppose being unconventional. Our policy should be to encourage people to dare to raise banners, to encourage people to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and not the opposite.

    论标新立异
    王士豪
    标新立异一直是一个带有讽刺和轻视意味的词儿。一提起标新立异，就会使人联想到“出风头”、“不自量力”等等。因此，人们都自觉或不自觉地成为标新立异的反对者。
    标新立异是否应该反对，不能一概而论。对马克思列宁主义和党的方针政策标新立异，或者像右派分子那样的颠倒黑白、歪曲事实的所谓“新”“异”，应该坚决反对。但是，对于科学方面的新异观点就应该采取完全不同的态度。
    标新立异是传统的对立物。所谓传统的观点，就是被人们一般认为正确的观点。后一代的科学家尊重前人研究的成果，懂得科学原有传统的力量和意义，并善于为科学利益来利用这些传统，是完全必要的。但是，绝不能以学习过去的经验，继承旧有的文化为满足，更不能躺在书本上，靠别人的结论过活。老一辈的科学家，由于条件的限制，他们的某些论点可能是错误的；有些论点虽然是正确的，但是随着时代的进展，就日趋陈腐而对科学的进一步发展起着阻碍作用。我们决不能把传统的观点视为一成不变和神圣不可侵犯的东西，恰恰相反，我们的任务就是根据科学的进一步发展，用新的观点来代替已经趋于陈腐的、阻碍科学前进的传统观点，从而为科学的发展开拓新的道路。
    世界上没有永恒不变的真理，一切都依条件、地点和时间为转移这一事物发展的普遍规律，已被全部科学发展的历史所证明。地球是宇宙中心的说法，曾经被认为是正确的观点，一千多年没有人敢去触动它，但是它不是真理，哥白尼用太阳中心说代替了地球中心说，促进了科学的发展。物种不变说，也曾经被许多人认为是正确的，但是达尔文的进化论公布，就从根本上否定了这种谬说，改变了人们对于自然和社会发展的认识。在以前的科学家看来，原子是不能再分裂的，可是科学的发展证明了打破原子核是完全可能的，这就给科学的进一步发展开辟了广阔的活动场所。
    科学的发展是无止境的，当着某一种旧的过了时的传统观点被人类普遍的抛弃、某一种新的论点被人类普遍接受的时候，更新的观点又会根据科学的进一步发展被提出来代替新的观点。这是科学发展的普遍规律。但是，新观点的建立不是一帆风顺的。因为不论何时，总有一些不善于思想的人死抱着旧的过了时的传统论点不放，新的论点一出现，他们就认为是逾越了常规，冠以“标新立异”的罪名而加以口诛笔伐。尤其是那些旧的统治阶级，他们生怕这会动摇了他们的统治地位。历史上新的观点受压抑、受打击的事例，比比皆是。当哥白尼的太阳中心学说提出的时候，一般人都讥笑他是狂妄之徒，认为他的学说是异端邪说。中世纪的教会把勇敢的思想家布鲁诺送到火刑堆上，因为他宣传了并且发展了哥白尼的太阳中心学说。他们还审判了老科学家伽利略，治以“有悖哲理，且与圣经相反，显系邪说”的罪名，并通过了禁止哥白尼学说传播的决议。但是，地球是茫无涯际的宇宙中一个小球的这一事实，却不是任何决议所能禁止得了的。在达尔文的进化论公布的时候，这个学说很受到宗教家和道德家的攻击，被斥之为“异端邪说”。英国牛津大学的“英国科学促进会”，在威尔伯尔福斯主教的领导下，大开其救主会，提出“拯救心灵，打倒进化论”，“打倒达尔文”的口号。美国的牧师亦大声疾呼，反对达尔文。可是，事实上正是因为有了这种“邪说”，才打破了宗教的迷妄，推翻了旧有的观念，推动了科学的发展。当马克思和恩格斯建立科学的马克思主义的时候，反动阶级及其御用学者也把它斥为异端邪说，并百般加以迫害。但是，事实证明，马克思主义是使人类得到彻底解放的真理。在我国历史上，也有许多这样的事例。在旧中国，把凡是敢于对传统的儒家学说提出怀疑的人，一概用“离经叛道”、“异端邪说”的罪名加以迫害甚至砍杀。马克思列宁主义传入中国之后，所有的反动统治者曾经把它视为“洪水猛兽”，一再下令禁止。但是，马克思列宁主义还是在中国的土地上生根发芽而成为中国人民谋取解放的指导思想。真理一定胜利，历史就是这样写着的。
    新生力量是不可战胜的，这是事物发展的绝对规律。但是，新与旧的斗争、新生力量战胜旧势力的反抗而最后取得胜利的斗争过程，不是采取直线式的进行，而是曲折的经过艰苦的斗争才发展起来的。在科学方面，为科学的进一步发展开辟广阔活动场所的新的论点，是要经过艰苦的斗争才建立起来的。为了打破保守势力的反抗而建立新的科学理论，就需要科学勇士，他们能够不顾一切地为真理奋斗，他们能够不怕任何障碍地反对陈旧的原理，为科学的新发展开拓道路。马克思主义的创始人——马克思在世时，是“最遭嫉恨最受诬蔑的人”，屡遭资本主义国家的政府驱逐出境，几无安身之地，资产者都争先恐后地纷纷诽谤和诅咒他。可是马克思却不顾这些，他把这一切都当作蜘蛛网一样抹去置之不理，仍继续走自己的路。列宁根据他对帝国主义时代资本主义的研究，提出了关于社会主义革命可能在单独一个国家里获得胜利的适合新的历史环境的新结论，来代替马克思和恩格斯研究自由资本主义所得出的社会主义革命不能在单独一个国家获得胜利的过了时的结论，从而把马克思主义理论向前推进了一步。当时普列汉诺夫认为列宁是“在讲梦话”，俄国科学界不少别的著名人物也都说他是破坏科学的人。可是，列宁却不顾一切地迈步直前。事实证明列宁是对的。马克思和列宁都是大胆进行斗争来反对陈旧科学，并为新科学开拓道路的科学勇士的模范。中国共产党成立以后，所有的反动统治者都以“杀勿赦”的惨酷手段来对付共产党人，甚至大动干戈来反对人民的革命运动。英勇的共产党人坚信共产主义制度在中国一定能够实现，奋不顾身地向一切反动势力进行坚决的斗争，终于推翻了国内外反动派的统治，建立了民主、自由、独立、富强的社会主义新中国。
    标新立异是盲从和保守的对立物，是敢于打破旧传统旧结论、产生新结论的先声。要打破旧理论建立新理论，除了具有不怕任何障碍、不顾一切的为真理而奋斗的勇敢精神之外，还要具有独创精神。要独创就必须破除迷信，就必须解放思想，要敢想、敢说、敢干。只要不是胡思乱想，而有一定的科学根据，理想是一定会实现的。人们想上天，就发明了飞机和火箭；人们想有千里眼，就创造了电视和无线电传真；人们想有顺风耳，就有无线电广播和收音机的出现。所有这些，都是人们想出来做出来的。如果人们被传统所束缚，不敢去想传统以外的任何事情，那末世界将永远停留在愚昧状态中而不会进入今日的原子时代。解放了的中国劳动人民在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，正以雷霆万钧之势破除一切迷信，实行全面的大跃进。发明家和技术革新者辈出。新的创造发明和技术革新有如雨后春笋，捷报频传，一日数起。前人没有做过的事情我们要做，外国人不敢干的事情我们要干，书本上没有的东西要叫它有。这种敢于打破旧说建立新说的革命创举，充分地说明了人们的思想一旦从传统观点的束缚下解放出来之后，是可以干出惊天动地的事情来的。
    敢于打破旧说创立新说，开创科学和技术新道路的，往往不是科学界的著名人物，而往往是在科学界全不著名的平凡的人物、实践家和工作革新者。他们的新论点在最初可能是不够全面或仅仅是探讨性的。因此，就不应因为其不够全面或因其有某些错误的地方而简单地加以否定，而应该给予支持和帮助。只有给予全力支持和帮助，在科学中才会出现“奇迹”。后来成为伟大学者的俄国的中学教员齐奥尔科夫斯基，在物理学家斯托列托夫和飞行问题专家茹科夫斯基的帮助下发明了金属飞艇，打开了人类飞出地球的大门。居里夫人在居里先生的鼓励下发现了放射性原素镭的提炼方法，开辟了近代科学的新途径。济南市南成记面粉厂老工人王学锐在大家的帮助下制成了小麦脱皮机，揭开了制粉业中技术革新的序幕。上海华亨染料厂木工徐阿桂在党的支持下创造了跃进式转动筛，从根本上解决了一直被专家们认为无法解决的粉尘飞扬问题。天津印染厂青年技术员梁树楷在党委的鼓励和支持之下试验成功了被认为是“异想天开”的不用染料染丝绸的“神话”，打破了技术神秘的观念，动摇了书本上陈旧的理论和法定的工艺规程。广东新会县青年农民周汉华在党支部的支持下试验成功了水稻与高粱的“远缘杂交”，破除了科学界的长期迷信，开辟了培育良种的新范例。目前在全国范围内正在蓬勃进行的技术革新运动，雄辩地证明了在党的鼓励和支持之下，解放了的中国劳动人民是完全能够做出前无古人的奇迹的。
    在社会主义社会中，新生事物的成长条件和过去根本不同了。但是，压抑新生力量，压抑合理意见的事并不是没有的。有些具有保守思想的人，往往宁愿采取一种大家认为正确的观点，一辈子都不放弃，对于反对所谓正确观点的新论点，不是采取慎重的态度去对待而是轻率地加以反对，不是采取通过科学界的自由讨论和实践的方法去解决而是简单地加以禁止，不是采取支持的态度而是采取压抑的态度。当新的论点提出后，他们总是先翻开书本看看是否前人已经讲过，凡是书本上没有的东西他们就持反对的态度。武汉市建筑工人龙文忠在研究电动挤浆砌墙机时，有人认为这是外国的专家研究多年都没有成功的事，而肯定这个“连个图纸都画不好”的工人决不能成功。青年农民杨朝横提出用新法栽培甘蔗时，受到甘蔗专家的强烈反对，被认为这是书本上没有过的，是“违反科学的规律”的。当全国农业发展纲要提出后，有人认为农业生产不能迅速增长，他们引经据典证明农业的发展只能是慢慢的，并且是不能保证的。事实证明，这些人都是思想懒汉，靠别人的结论过活的人。
    在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告中，毛主席指出：“艺术上不同的形式和风格可以自由发展，科学上不同的学派可以自由争论。利用行政力量，强制推行一种风格，一种学派，禁止另一种风格，另一种学派，我们认为会有害于艺术和科学的发展。艺术和科学中的是非问题，应当通过艺术界科学界的自由讨论去解决，通过艺术和科学的实践去解决，而不应当采取简单的方法去解决”。“对于科学上、艺术上的是非，应当保持慎重的态度，提倡自由讨论，不要轻率地作结论。我们认为，采取这种态度可以帮助科学和艺术得到比较顺利的发展。”这是对待科学工作所应当采取的方针。
    科学的发展是不同意见争论的结果。没有不同意见的相互论战，科学就不会发展。新异观点的出现应当受到我们的欢迎。如果它是错误的，那末就让传统的观点战胜新的观点；如果它是正确的，那末就让它战胜传统的观点。只有经过大鸣大放大辩论，才能明辨是非，才能使科学前进一步。没有新和异，科学就不会发展，社会就不会前进。一般地反对标新立异，是不正确的。我们的方针应该是鼓励人们敢于树立旗帜，鼓励人们敢想、敢说、敢干，而不是相反。
