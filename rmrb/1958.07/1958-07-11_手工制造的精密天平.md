    Handcrafted Precision Balance

    Chen Junliang, a member of the Wuhan No. 1 Clock and Instrument Repair Cooperative, has long wanted to learn how to make a first-class analytical balance.

    He had only been repairing balances for three years, and the cooperative only had a broken lathe. With the support of the Party organization, he boldly started working with these less-than-ideal conditions. After half a month, he finally made a first-class analytical balance.

    This first-class analytical balance has a sensitivity of 1/10,000th of a gram. Placing a short strand of hair or fine cotton thread on the balance pan will cause the pointer to sensitively quiver, indicating their weight. After national verification, the quality of the balance has caught up with Shanghai products.

    手工制造的精密天平
    武汉市第一钟表仪器修理社社员陈钧梁，长期以来想学会制造一等分析天平。
    他修理天平只不过三年，社里只有一部破车床。他得到党组织的支持，利用这些并不优越的条件，大胆地干起来了。半个月来，他终于做成了一等分析天平。
    这个一等分析天平感应量是万分之一克，把一根短的头发或短细棉纱头放在天平盘上，也可以使指针敏感地颤动起来，告诉人们它们有多重。经国家鉴验，天平的质量已赶上上海产品。
