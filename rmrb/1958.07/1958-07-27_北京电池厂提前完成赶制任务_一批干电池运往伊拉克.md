Xinhua News Agency, 26th: 11,500 dry batteries for radios were shipped from Beijing to the Republic of Iraq today.

This batch of dry batteries was completed six days ahead of schedule by the workers of the jointly-owned Beijing Battery Factory through continuous hard work for two days and nights. On the 24th, the factory leadership announced to all employees that they had received this order, and the entire factory immediately launched a surge of supporting the Iraqi people with practical actions. Workers' pledges, guarantees, and challenge letters were posted all over the workshops and courtyards. Everyone was racing against time; those who were supposed to get off work refused to leave, and those who were supposed to take over came early. Some people were reluctant to leave the workshop even for meals and sleep. Thanks to the workers' tireless labor, a task that normally took eight days to complete was finished in just two days and nights.

The jointly-owned Jinghua Printing Factory, responsible for manufacturing the colored paper boxes for the dry batteries, also exerted their greatest efforts, completing a week's worth of work in thirty-six hours.

    北京电池厂提前完成赶制任务
    一批干电池运往伊拉克
    新华社26日讯　一万一千五百个收音机上用的干电池，今天从北京运往伊拉克共和国。
    这批干电池是公私合营北京电池厂职工连续苦战两昼夜提前六天完成的。24日，这个厂的领导上向全体职工宣布接到这批定货后，全厂立即掀起了用实际行动支援伊拉克人民的热潮。工人们的决心书、保证书和挑战书贴满了车间和庭院。大家都在和时间赛跑，该下班的人不肯下班，接班的人提前就跑来了。有的人吃饭、睡觉都不肯离开车间。由于工人们废寝忘食地劳动，平时需要八天才能完成的任务，只用两昼夜就完成了。
    公私合营京华胶印厂负责制造装干电池的彩色纸盒，这个厂的职工也发挥了最大的干劲，把一星期的工作量，在三十六小时内就完成了。
