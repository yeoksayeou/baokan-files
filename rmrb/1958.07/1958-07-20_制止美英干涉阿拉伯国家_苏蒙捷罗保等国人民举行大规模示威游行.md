They stuck countless placards on the iron railings of the embassy. These placards read: "Down with the warmongers!" "Long live free Iraq and Lebanon!" "Long live the Arab people!" "Shameless US and British colonialists!". The door of the US embassy was tightly closed, and all the windows were also closed, with the curtains drawn. The participants in the demonstration demanded that the US ambassador come out and meet them. The US embassy personnel did not dare to come out to respond to the demands of the people of Moscow. The demonstration continued for more than three hours.
