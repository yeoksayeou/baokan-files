Should Students be Trained to Become Laborers?
A Major Debate on the Integration of Education and Labor Unfolds at Peking University

(Reported by this newspaper) A major debate on the educational policy of "education serving politics, and the integration of education with labor" is unfolding in depth at Peking University.

When the Party proposed this educational policy, the Peking University Party Committee announced a five-year plan (draft), explicitly stating that in the future, it would "cultivate students to become laborers with communist consciousness, mastering modern cultural science and technology, and in good physical health." This evoked a strong reaction among students. Many people had varying degrees of confused understanding of this policy, with about 10% openly opposed. As these students said, "The question of whether or not to become a laborer touches our very core."

	Is Participating in Physical Labor a Waste?

They believe that "after studying at university for five years and learning a lot of professional theory, going to be an ordinary worker or farmer, only engaging in simple labor, isn't this a waste?" Some also asked, "I'm studying cutting-edge disciplines, theory, which the country currently needs. I'm working in my own field, which is also being a laborer, so why must I become a worker or farmer?"

Most students disagree with this argument. They use facts and reasoning to explain that those holding the above views regard ordinary workers and farmers as simple people who can only repeatedly perform a few operations. The actual situation is absolutely not as they think and say. Ordinary laborers – workers and farmers – are a noble title. This is not only because they create social material wealth, but also because the labor of workers and farmers is the most creative itself. In the current situation of the great leap forward in the motherland, many miracles have appeared in industrial and agricultural production, the vast majority of which were not created by those intellectuals and experts with so-called "professional theory," but by ordinary workers and farmers. A wheat yield of 7,320 jin per mu, and ordinary workers and technicians making activated carbon, are both world firsts.

Is it a waste for people who study cutting-edge disciplines and theory to become ordinary workers and farmers after graduation? Even professors and students of the Biology Department cannot theoretically explain the wheat yield of 7,320 jin per mu. This shows that participating in actual production and being an ordinary worker or farmer is not because one has learned too much theory, but too little. So it can't be said to be a waste. If we only cultivate empty-headed theorists who are divorced from production practice, who cannot solve practical problems and do not contribute to construction, that is the greatest waste.

	Not Lowering Student Quality, But Improving Student Quality

In the debate, some students also believed that the combination of education and labor would lower the quality of students, hinder the development of science in our country, and make it impossible to catch up with the advanced levels of the world. They said: "Time is a constant, if there is more labor, the amount of things learned will inevitably be less." "If you learn too little knowledge, you can only go down and not up in the future, and you can't do scientific research." "You say you can do both literary and military things, you just want to cultivate all-purpose cadres." "Being a worker-peasant and a scientist cannot be done at the same time, we mainly do advanced things, if Peking University doesn't focus on improvement, where else can we improve?"

Many students disagree with this view. They refuted this "quality reduction" theory with a large number of facts. They believe that the quality of students does not depend on how many books they read or how many documents they read, but on whether these theories are combined with practice, and whether they can use theory to guide practice and solve practical problems. That kind of "theory for theory's sake" learning is just using theory as a false decoration to scare people. Once they encounter practical problems, they make a fool of themselves. For example, biology students can't even distinguish between rice and wheat. A student from the second class of the second grade of the Mechanics Department only knew how to design according to the standards recorded in the book when the class went to the countryside to help farmers build hydropower stations, and drew five drawings behind closed doors, which were all unusable because they were divorced from reality. The above facts fully demonstrate that the result of theory being divorced from practice and education being divorced from labor is that the quality of students is not high but low.

Now, although the communist education policy has been implemented for a short time, the effect is very obvious. The students used a large number of facts to fully illustrate the improvement in the quality of students under the new policy. For example, students from the Semiconductor Factory of the Physics Department mastered the specifications of rectifier products through production labor, and increased the rectification ratio of cuprous oxide rectifiers from tens and hundreds to around ten thousand, reaching the industrial standard. They made six new products in two weeks, five of which reached the international level, and some products, such as selenium photovoltaic cells, were not successfully made by their teachers in the past. Obviously, the quality has not decreased but increased.

Some people are worried that our country's science and technology will not be able to catch up with the international level, which is also unfounded. Isn't a wheat yield of 7,320 jin per mu an international level? The development of science depends on the masses, not just a few intellectuals, and the broad masses of workers and peasants are now rapidly mastering science and technology, so there is no need to worry.

The combination of education and labor not only improves the quality of learning, but also improves political quality, and cultivates students to move towards the path of being both red and expert, so that they can become communist laborers. For example, biology students participated in agricultural production and planted their own experimental fields. When they saw the rain, they no longer worried about their clothes getting wet and lying in bed humming songs and complaining a bit of boredom like in the past, but thought about how much the crops needed the rain; if it rained too much, they would automatically get up in the middle of the night to drain the fields. Their feelings have begun to change.

	Laborers are Glorious, "People Above People" are Shameful

In the debate, everyone further analyzed the essence of these opponents' arguments. The waste theory, the quality reduction theory, and other arguments, generally speaking, all reflect that they consciously or unconsciously regard labor from the perspective of the exploiting class, and the traditional concept of "all occupations are inferior, only studying is superior" in class society for thousands of years still tightly binds them. In fact, they still want to maintain the special status of intellectuals, are unwilling to be laborers, and want to be "people above people" who are higher than the working people. After reading a few books, they think they are amazing, rare and precious, and look down on the workers and peasants who create material wealth and support them. The reason why they have the above wrong arguments is mainly because they do not have enough understanding of the current situation of rapid progress in the country. They think that communism is still a distant future in China, and they have not seen that many sprouts of communism have now appeared.

In addition, some students have confused views, do not understand that education is a weapon of class struggle, and do not understand that knowledge comes from practice. Production activities are the most basic practice of mankind. They do not understand that to inherit useful knowledge from predecessors, one must obtain direct knowledge from labor and practice. The ultimate purpose of learning knowledge and mastering knowledge is to use it in actual life and guide practice.

At the recent Fourth Congress of the Communist Youth League of Peking University, emphasis was also placed on analyzing and criticizing various erroneous views and viewpoints exposed in the debate. Vice President Jiang Longji also made a report on implementing the educational policy at the meeting. (Attached picture)

### 应不应当培养学生成为劳动者？  北京大学展开了关于教育与劳动相结合的大辩论

    应不应当培养学生成为劳动者？
    北京大学展开了关于教育与劳动相结合的大辩论
    本报讯　一场关于“教育为政治服务，教育与劳动结合”的教育方针的大辩论，正在北京大学深入展开。
    当党提出这个教育方针后，北大党委公布了五年规划（草案），明确提出今后“培养学生成为具有共产主义觉悟的、掌握现代文化科学技术的、身体健康的劳动者”。这在学生中引起了强烈的反应。许多人对这个方针都有着不同程度的糊涂认识，其中有10％左右是公开反对的。正如这些学生所说：“做不做劳动者的问题，触到了我们的命根子。”
      参加体力劳动是浪费吗？
    他们认为“在大学读书五年，学了很多专业理论，去做一个普通工人、农民，只能从事一种简单的劳动，这不是浪费是什么呢？”也有人提出“我学的是尖端学科，是理论，国家目前很需要，我搞自己所学的这一行，也是劳动者，为什么一定要去当工人农民呢？”
    这一论点，大部分学生不同意。他们用摆事实、讲道理的办法说明持有上述看法的人，是把普通工人和农民看作是简单的、只能重复进行几种操作的人。实际情况绝不是像他们所想和所说的那样。普通劳动者——工人农民，是一个崇高的称号。这不仅是因为他们创造了社会物质财富，而且工人农民的劳动本身就是最富有创造性的。在当前祖国大跃进的形势下，工农业生产出现了许多奇迹，绝大多数并不是那些有所谓“专业理论”的知识分子专家创造出来的，而是那些普通工人农民创造出来的。小麦亩产七千三百二十斤，普通工人技术员制成了活性炭，这都是世界上的创举。
    学尖端学科、学理论的人，毕业后去当普通工人农民是否浪费呢？小麦亩产七千三百二十斤，生物系的教授、学生也都不能从理论上加以说明。这说明参加实际生产，当个普通工人、农民，并不是学的理论太多，而是太少。所以绝不能说是浪费。如果只是培养那些脱离生产实际的空头理论家，不能解决实际问题，对建设不起作用，这倒是最大的浪费。
      不是降低学生质量，而是提高学生质量
    在辩论中，也有一些学生认为，教育和劳动结合会降低学生的质量，阻碍我国科学发展，无法赶上世界先进水平。他们说：“时间是个常数，劳动多了、学的东西必然少了。”“知识学得太少了，以后只能下不能上，没法搞科学研究。”“说什么能文能武，你们就是要培养万金油干部”。“当工农和科学家不能同时并举，我们主要是搞高级的，北大不搞提高，上哪儿提高去？”
    许多学生不同意这种看法，他们以大量的事实驳斥了这种“质量降低”论。他们认为，学生质量并不在于他念了多少书，读了多少文献，而要看这些理论是否和实际结合，是否能够运用理论指导实践，解决实际问题，那种“为理论而理论”的学习，只不过是把理论作为虚伪的装饰品，用以吓唬人罢了。而一当碰到实际问题，就洋相百出了。例如，生物系的学生连水稻和小麦也分不清。力学系二年级二班一位学生在该班下乡帮助农民建水电站时，就只知道根据书上记载的标准设计，闭门造车地画了五次图，也同样因脱离实际全不能用。以上的事实充分地说明了理论脱离实际，教育脱离劳动的结果，学生的质量不是高而是低。
    现在贯彻共产主义的教育方针，虽然时间很短，效果却是很明显的，学生们运用了大量的事实，充分地说明了在新方针下学生质量的提高。例如物理系四年级半导体工厂的学生，通过生产劳动，掌握了整流器产品规格，把氧化亚铜整流器的整流比从几十几百提高到一万上下，达到工业上用的标准，两周中制成了六种新产品，其中五种达到国际水平，而有的产品，如硒光电池是过去他们的教师也没作成功的。显然，质量不是降低而是提高了。
    有人担心我国科学技术会赶不上国际水平，这也是没有根据的。小麦亩产七千三百二十斤，这不是国际水平吗？发展科学是要靠群众的，不能只靠几个知识分子，而广大的工农群众现在正在迅速地掌握科学技术，完全不用担心。
    教育和劳动相结合，不仅是提高了学习质量，同时也提高了政治质量，培养学生向着又红又专的道路前进，使自己成为共产主义的劳动者。如生物系的学生参加了农业生产，自己种了试验田，瞧着天下雨，就不再是过去那样只担心自己的衣服淋湿，躺在床上哼哼歌曲，埋怨两句不好玩等，而是想到庄稼如何需要雨了；雨下得太多，他们会半夜里自动起床去田里排水。感情上已经开始发生变化。
      劳动者光荣　“人上人”可耻
    在辩论中，大家还进一步分析了这些反对论者的实质，浪费论、质量降低论，还有其他论调，总的说来，都反映出他们自觉与不自觉地以剥削阶级的观点来看待劳动，几千年来阶级社会中“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的传统观念还紧紧地束缚着他们。实际上，他们还想保持知识分子的特殊地位，不愿意作一个劳动者，想作高于劳动人民的“人上人”。他们读过几本书以后，就自认了不起，奇货可居，看不起创造物质财富、养活他们的工人农民了。他们所以有以上的错误论点，主要是对当前国内飞跃的形势认识不够，他们以为共产主义在中国还是遥远的未来，没有看到现在就出现了不少共产主义的萌芽。
    此外，有的同学存有糊涂观点，不了解教育是阶级斗争的武器，不了解知识是来源于实践。生产活动是人类最基本的实践，他们不了解要继承前人有用的知识，就要从劳动和实践中获得直接的知识。而学习知识掌握知识的最终目的，则是为了用于实际生活中，指导实践。
    在最近召开的共青团北京大学第四届代表大会上，也着重分析批驳了辩论中暴露出来的各种错误看法和观点。副校长江隆基在会上也作了有关贯彻教育方针的报告。（附图片）
