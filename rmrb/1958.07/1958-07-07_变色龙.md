    Chameleon
    Liu Baixian
    Among reptiles, perhaps none is better at changing the color of its skin than the chameleon. Chameleons are only found in the tropics, northern Africa, southern Spain, Asia Minor, and in the forests of two or three small islands in the Mediterranean. Because they are good at catching flies, some people even keep them in their gardens and homes.

    On a sunny day, if you take a walk in the jujube or coconut groves in those places, you will often hear rustling sounds from the trees, followed by some falling wood shavings. If you look up carefully, you will find that it is a chameleon lying on the tree. Its body color is the same as the color of the branches. It is waiting there for flying insects.

    The chameleon has a very long tail. When climbing on a tree, it uses the end of its tail to wrap around the branch to maintain its balance. The ends of its claws have small hooks, and the soles of its toes have suckers, so it can not only climb freely on trees, but also on the walls of houses. It lies on a branch with the same color as the branch. Its pearl-like eyes emit a shimmering line of sight, and no matter what insect flies by, it can't escape it. In its big mouth, there is also a stick-like, retractable long tongue. If an insect flies over, it quickly extends its long tongue and catches the flying insect.

    The most interesting thing is the battle between the chameleon and the tropical lizard. A Russian hunter, Ilya Bagrov, once wrote: A lizard suddenly appeared on the jujube tree, trying to see what the chameleon was doing, but the chameleon did not move at all, still lying in the same place, its eyes vigilantly watching. At this time, the chameleon was probably angry. Its original light green skin immediately turned dark green, then brown, then yellow, then rose, and finally orange. After a long time, the lizard remained completely "unfathomable" to it, and finally dared not fight it, and left it helplessly.

    The great Russian writer Chekhov used the title "Chameleon" to describe Ochumelov, the old Russian police officer who was good at observing the wind and changing his colors: When the east wind comes, he leans to the west; when the west wind comes, he leans to the east. He is like a chameleon, constantly changing due to the different colors of the surrounding environment. Chekhov used him to satirize and lash out at certain Russians before the October Revolution. Now, we all want to be thorough leftists, and we should hand over our true feelings to the Party and the people. People like chameleons are not only shameful, but also sinful.

    变色龙
    刘百先
    在爬虫类动物里，最会变换自己的皮肤颜色的，恐怕没有比得上变色龙的了。变色龙只产在热带、非洲北部、西班牙南部、小亚细亚和地中海二、三个小岛的树林里。由于它善于捕捉苍蝇，所以有些人家还在庭园和住宅里饲养它。
    在天气晴朗的日子，如果在那些地方的枣林或椰子林里散步，你就常会听到树上沙沙作响，继而落下一些木屑，你向上细看，便会发现原来是一条变色龙伏在树上，它身体的颜色跟树枝的颜色一样，它正在那里等待着飞虫呢。
    变色龙有一条很长的尾巴，爬在树上时便用尾巴末端卷在树枝上，以保持身体的均衡；爪端有小钩，趾底又有吸盘，所以不仅能在树上、而且能在屋宇的墙壁上自由自在地爬行。它伏在树枝上就和树枝同一样的颜色，一双像珍珠色的眼睛，放出一道闪闪有光的视线，无论什么昆虫飞过，总逃不了它。在它的大嘴里，还有一根棍棒状能伸缩的长舌，若果昆虫飞过来，它便很快地伸出长舌，把飞虫逮捕住。
    最有趣的，是变色龙和热带蜥蜴的战斗。从前有一个俄国猎师伊卢·巴哥夫写道：在枣树上突然又出现了一匹蜥蜴，它想看看变色龙的动静，可是变色龙一动也不动，仍然伏在原地方，两眼骨溜溜地警戒着。这时大概是变色龙发了怒吧，原来是淡绿色的皮肤，立刻就变了深绿色，一会儿变成褐色，又变成黄色，再过一会就变成了蔷薇色，最后又变成橙色的了。过了很久，蜥蜴对它始终“莫测高深”，终于不敢跟它战斗，无可奈何地离开了它。
    俄国伟大作家契呵夫曾用“变色龙”这题目描绘旧俄警官奥楚蔑洛夫这个善于观风变色的家伙：东风来了，他就倒向西边；西风来了，他就倒向东边。他像一条变色龙，因四周环境的颜色不同而时常变化。契呵夫用他来讥讽鞭挞十月革命前的某些俄国人。现在，我们都想要做一个彻底的左派，就应该把自己的真情实意向党、向人民交出来。像变色龙一样的人，不仅是可耻的，而且是罪恶的。（赵志方插画）（附图片）
