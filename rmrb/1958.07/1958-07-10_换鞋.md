    Changing Shoes
    Zhao Cong, Jiezhuang Agricultural Cooperative, Hunyuan, Shanxi
    The night before going to the mountains, I took off my leather shoes and put on a pair of round-toed cloth shoes made of serge, with cloth soles. My wife looked at them and said, "Very nice," but I always felt they weren't as good as my original leather shoes, simply because I was going to the mountains to participate in labor, and no matter how good the leather shoes were, I couldn't wear them. I thought: put them away, and I'll wear them again when I return to the city.
    About ten days after going to the mountains, I returned to the county for a meeting. During the break, I went to the street with comrades from the original office, looking at the clothes, shoes, and socks people were wearing, and I always felt a bit out of place. Later, I insisted on changing into those leather shoes.
    About a month after going to the mountains, I went from Jiezhuang Village to Qingcijing Village. A group of villagers stood at the entrance of the village alley, and when they saw me, they asked, "Where are you from?" I said, "Jiezhuang Village." "Are you a new cooperative member?" I was a little surprised: "How did you know?" "You can tell from the shoes you're wearing." My face flushed immediately. Another time, I went to visit a cooperative member's home. There were four or five people sitting on the kang. The space wasn't big, and the shoes were taken off on the ground. I also took off my shoes on the ground. The old lady immediately took my shoes to the edge of the kang. I said, "Why not leave them on the ground?" "Dark shoes, it would be a pity if people stepped on them." The old lady said this without malice, but my heart felt like it was being pricked by needles. When will I be able to integrate with all the masses, and when will my shoes be able to come down from the edge of the kang to the ground? Gradually, I began to like the farmers' simple clothes, especially those sturdy mountain-climbing shoes. By the time I returned to the county for the second time (three months after going to the mountains), the situation was different. Instead, I was wearing a pair of "mountain-climbing shoes" made of coarse cloth, with two forks at the toe, and the shoe upper was densely stitched with thread. The soles were half an inch thick, and they wouldn't budge when they hit a rock. Those sturdy mountain-climbing shoes really helped me a lot in my labor. Now that I've put them on, I can't take them off.

    换鞋
    山西浑源界庄农业社  赵琮
    上山前的一个晚上，我脱下了皮鞋，换上了一双用冲服呢做的毛布底圆口鞋，我女人在旁边看了看说：“很美”，但我总觉得不如我原来那双皮鞋好，只是因为自己上山参加劳动了，皮鞋再好也不能穿去。心想：放起来吧，等我回城来再穿。
    大约是上山后的十几天，我回县来开会。休息时，就和原机关的同志一块上街，看看人家，穿的衣服鞋袜，总觉得自己有些不相称，后来硬是换上了那双皮鞋。
    上山后一个月左右，我由界庄村到青磁井村去，进村的巷口上站着一伙老乡，见了我就问：“哪里的？”我说：“界庄村。”“是新社员吗？”我听了有些惊奇：“您怎么就知道？”“看你穿的那双鞋也不一样呀。”我的脸顿时像火烧一样。又有一次，我到一户社员家去串门子，炕上坐着四、五个人，地方不大，鞋脱下半地，我也把鞋脱在地上，老大娘马上把我的鞋拿到炕边上。我说：“为啥不搁在地上。”“黑黑的鞋，叫人蹬了，多可惜。”老大娘说这话，并无恶意，但我的心却像针扎一样。我在什么时候才能和所有群众融洽在一块，我的鞋在何时才能由炕边上下了地。渐渐我开始对农民那朴素的衣服特别是那双结实的砍山鞋欢上了我的心头。赶到第二次回县（是上山的三个月后），情况就不一样了，而是穿着一双用粗布作的“砍山鞋”，鞋脑头有两股叉，鞋帮上用线 纳的密密麻麻的，鞋底足有半寸厚，碰到石头上纹分不动。我劳动起来那结实的砍山鞋确实帮了我不少忙，我如今穿上它已经脱不下来了。
