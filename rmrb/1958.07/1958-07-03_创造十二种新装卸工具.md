    Creating Twelve New Loading and Unloading Tools
    Under the inspiration of the General Line, all the workers in the freight workshop of our Shijiazhuang Station launched a mass movement to improve and create tools with daring thoughts and actions. In less than a month, we manufactured twelve new types of loading and unloading tools. These new tools have the advantages of loading more, unloading faster, and ensuring safety. For example, in the past, when less-than-carload (LCL) handling workers moved heavy goods weighing less than three tons, it required twenty people to load and unload them simultaneously using crowbars, levers, and ropes, resulting in low work efficiency and safety hazards. After painstaking research by Fan Jichen and other loading and unloading workers of the third shift, they successfully developed a "counter-wheel" loading and unloading tool. By placing the "counter-wheel" under the bottom of the goods for transport, it can reduce manpower by half and increase work efficiency by more than eight times. After the 22nd group for loading and unloading whole cars used waste materials to trial-produce an "ice adder," each time they added ice to a refrigerated car, they could hoist blocks of ice weighing 40 kilograms, increasing efficiency by more than two times compared to manually pulling ice. The "crane balance bar" trial-produced by the first mechanical group increased the hoisting capacity from one container weighing three tons to two containers weighing six tons at a time, greatly enhancing the role of the crane.
    Recently, we also plan to trial-produce eight new types of tools to improve crane operations, in order to further increase work efficiency.

    创造十二种新装卸工具
    我们石家庄车站货运车间的全体职工，在总路线的鼓舞下，掀起了一个敢想、敢作的改良工具、创造工具的群众运动。在不到一个月内，我们就制造出新式装卸工具十二种。这些新工具都有装得多、卸得快和保证安全的优点。如零担装卸工人过去搬运三吨以下的笨重货物，需要二十人同时用棍杠、撬和绳拉等工具装卸，作业效率低，而且不安全。经过三班装卸工樊计辰等苦心研究，试制成功一种“对轮”装卸工具，把“对轮”放在货物底部托运，可以减少一半人力，提高工作效率八倍多。整车装卸二十二组利用废料试制成“加冰器”以后，每次往冷藏车加冰可吊块冰四十公斤，较单用人力拉冰提高效率两倍多。机械一组试制的“吊车平衡杠”，由一次吊装三吨重的一个集装箱，提高到一次吊装六吨重的两个集装箱，大大发挥吊车的作用。
    最近我们还计划试制八种改进吊车作业新式工具，以便更多地提高工作效率。
