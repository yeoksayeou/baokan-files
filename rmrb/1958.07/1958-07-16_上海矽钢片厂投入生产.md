Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th - The Shanghai Silicon Steel Sheet Factory, with an annual output of 30,000 tons, recently went into production. It took only nine months from the start of construction to the start of production.

Since ground was broken for this factory in October of last year, all efforts have been concentrated on building the main factory building. In order to strive for the early production of silicon steel sheets to meet the needs of the electromechanical industry, the construction engineering company, the installation company, and the production units undertaking the construction of this factory strengthened their collaboration and adopted the method of simultaneous civil engineering, installation, and production. Currently, the workshop floor has not yet been paved with concrete, and the side walls have not yet been built.

Silicon steel sheets are an indispensable raw material for many electrical equipment such as generators, motors, and transformers. Silicon steel sheets account for about 40% of the total weight of a motor; the consumption of generators is even greater. In the past, the silicon steel sheets needed by our country were mainly imported, except for a part produced by Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

    上海矽钢片厂投入生产
    新华社上海15日电　年产三万吨的上海矽钢片厂最近投入生产。它从开始基建到投入生产，共花了九个月时间。
    这座工厂从去年10月破土动工以来，便集中全力建设主厂房。为了争取早日生产矽钢片，供应机电工业的需要，承建这个厂的建筑工程公司、安装公司和生产单位加强了协作，采取边土建、边安装、边生产的办法。现在，车间的地面还没有铺混凝土，边墙也没砌。
    矽钢片是发电机、电动机、变压器等许多电器设备不可缺少的原材料。一台电动机的总重量中，约有40％是矽钢片；发电机的耗用量则更大。过去我国需要的矽钢片，除了太原钢铁厂和鞍山钢铁公司生产一部分以外，其余都靠进口。
