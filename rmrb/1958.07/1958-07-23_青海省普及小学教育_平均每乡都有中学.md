Qinghai Province Popularizes Elementary Education
Average Township Now Has a Middle School

(Our reporter Zhao Huaiqing reports) The cultural and educational undertakings in Qinghai Province are developing rapidly. Elementary education has been popularized throughout the province, and there is now an average of one middle school per township.

From April to now, eleven counties and cities in the agricultural areas have established 713 elementary schools, increasing the enrollment rate of school-age children from the original 52% to over 86%. In this work, the Mutual Assistance Tu Autonomous County took the lead, establishing more than 100 elementary schools in early May, with 95% of school-age children in the county enrolled.

The cultural and educational undertakings in Qinghai Province were originally very backward. In 1949, there were only over 20,000 elementary school students in the entire province, accounting for 14% of all school-age children. In the eight years since liberation, the number of elementary school students has increased more than tenfold, but it still cannot meet the needs of the broad masses of people for cultural learning. Especially since the launch of the fertilizer accumulation and water conservancy construction movements last winter and this spring, the masses, while engaging in technological revolution, have also become particularly eager for culture. Commune members in Huangzhong County said: Tractors are iron oxen, but they can't be driven without culture.

In the work of popularizing education, Qinghai Province first paid attention to mobilizing the whole Party and the entire people, strengthening political and ideological education, thereby launching a mass movement to run schools. In the past, some cadres and the masses held conservative ideas and mystical views about running schools. For example, some cadres believed that "it is impossible to popularize elementary education in two or three years" and "the masses have no experience and will not run schools," etc. These erroneous ideas were resolved through mass debates. Cadres of various townships and communes, and elementary school teachers went deep into each household to mobilize, publicizing the important role of learning culture in building socialism, and dispelling the ideas among the masses that "studying is useless" and "cadres are all being sent down, and it's enough to just know how to work to have food to eat," achieving the goal of the whole people running schools. Each township in Mutual Assistance Tu Autonomous County established a school management committee, with the township party secretary, school principal, and commune director all taking the lead and collectively leading. After elementary schools became part of the commune's work, commune cadres and members were very concerned about the schools, ensuring the mobilization of children to enroll and the consolidation of students.

In solving problems such as classrooms, desks and benches, and teachers, all localities simplified and utilized local talent. Huangzhong County extracted 227 cadres who could serve as teachers, solving the problem of teachers. When Huangyuan County solved the problem of the low teaching quality of new teachers, they adopted the method of veteran teachers supporting and guiding, extracting veteran teachers to help new teachers teach classes in the new schools for a week.

Qinghai Province's attention to solving specific difficulties has played an important role in promoting the popularization of elementary education. For example, in order to create enrollment conditions for school-age children, Huangzhong County established 694 nurseries (groups). In order to accommodate some children who were not old enough to enter school but were too old for nurseries, a group of kindergartens were established. In many townships in Mutual Assistance Tu Autonomous County, kindergartens and nurseries were set up in elementary schools. Students would bring their children to school when they went to school and take them away when school was dismissed. In addition, Huangyuan County adopted the method of collective feeding and grazing for private livestock.

While popularizing elementary education, Qinghai Province has also established 274 agricultural middle schools and spare-time middle schools in the past two months, with an enrollment of more than 10,000 students. There is now an average of one middle school per township, solving the problem of enrollment for all senior elementary school graduates and some literacy students.

    青海省普及小学教育
    平均每乡都有中学
    本报讯  记者赵淮青报道：青海省文化教育事业发展迅速。全省已普及了小学教育，平均每个乡都有了中学。
    从今年4月到现在，农业区十一个县市，办起了小学七百一十三所，学龄儿童入学率从原来的52％，增加到86％以上。在这个工作中，互助土族自治县一马当先，5月初即办起小学一百多所，全县95％的学龄儿童入了学。
    青海省原来的文化教育事业非常落后，1949年全省小学学生只有两万多人，占全部学龄儿童14％。解放八年来，小学生入学人数虽然增长了十倍以上，但仍不能满足广大群众学习文化的要求，特别是去冬今春开展积肥、修水利运动以来，群众在技术革命的同时，对文化的要求也特别迫切。湟中县的农业社社员说：拖拉机是铁牛，没有文化开不走。
    青海省在普及教育的工作中，首先注意了全党全民动手、加强政治思想教育，从而掀起一个群众性的办学运动。过去，部分干部和群众对办学存在着保守思想和神秘观点，如有的干部认为“两、三年不可能普及小学教育”“群众没经验，不会办学”，等等，这些错误思想都通过群众性的辩论得到了解决。各乡、社干部、小学教师深入各户动员，宣传学文化对建设社会主义的重要作用，解除了群众中认为“念书没啥用处”“干部都下放了，光会劳动就有饭吃”的思想，达到了全民大办学校的目的。互助土族自治县各乡成立了学校管理委员会，乡委书记、学校校长、农业社主任都亲自动手、集体领导。小学成为社的工作一部分以后，社干部和社员对学校非常关心，动员儿童入学和巩固学生有了保证。
    各地在解决教室、桌凳、教师等问题时，都是因陋就简，就地发掘人才。湟中县抽出二百二十七名能作教师的干部，解决了师资问题。湟源县在解决新教师教学质量不高的问题时，采用老教师支援、辅导的办法，抽出老教师以一周时间到新校帮助新教师教课。
    青海省各地注意解决具体困难对促进普及小学教育起了重要作用。如湟中县为了给学龄儿童创造入学条件，成立了六百九十四个托儿所（组），为收容一些还不够入学年龄、入托儿所又太大的儿童，成立了一批幼儿园。互助土族自治县许多乡的幼儿园、托儿所就设在小学校内，学生上学时将娃娃抱去，散学时带走。另外，湟源县对自留家畜采取了集体喂养、放牧的办法。
    与普及小学教育同时，青海省在最近两个月，办起农业中学、业余中学二百七十四所，入学人数达一万多人，平均每个乡都有了中学，解决了所有高小毕业生和部分脱盲学员的升学问题。
