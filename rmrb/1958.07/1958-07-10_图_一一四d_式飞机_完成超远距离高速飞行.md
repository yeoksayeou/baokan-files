    “图—一一四D”式飞机
    完成超远距离高速飞行
    据新华社9日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联著名飞机设计师图波列夫院士设计的“图—114D”式涡轮喷气螺旋桨客机最近完成了一次超远距离高速度飞行。飞行距离长达三万四千四百公里，大大超过了沿着莫斯科所在的纬度上绕地球一圈的路程。
    整个飞行，包括在途中的三次着陆，持续了七十七小时。在这段时期内，飞机在空中飞行的时间是四十八小时三十分，平均飞行速度是每小时七百一十公里；飞行高度是一万至一万二千公尺。
    这次飞行是从莫斯科开始的，途中首先绕经齐克西到海参崴，再绕道彼得罗巴夫罗夫斯克—堪察加到塔什干，然后经斯大林纳巴德、吉克桑岛到明斯克，最后经列宁格勒、维尔纽斯、基什纽、阿什哈巴德回到莫斯科。途中飞经十五个加盟共和国首都，只在海参崴、塔什干和明斯克三地作了中途着陆。在飞行过程中，飞机各部分都工作得很好。外部和内部的联系也很可靠。
