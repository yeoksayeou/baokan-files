Summer Vacation Life

    College Students Run Internship Store
    In Shuangyushu, Haidian District, Beijing, a "reopened" department store is attracting customers. It turns out that this is the first internship store of the Department of Trade Economics of Renmin University of China. The old customers here are surprised to find that the store's appearance has been completely renewed in just one week. The glass counters in the knitwear department were originally arranged in a long, serpentine line, and customers had to have the salespersons retrieve items from the shelves behind them. Now, the students have learned from the "Tianqiao" model, separating the glass counters and placing them diagonally, opening up the shelves so customers can freely choose their goods. The food department, originally at the back, has also been moved to the front for the convenience of customers, and a new product section has been set up. All these arrangements were carefully planned and implemented by the trade economics students after repeated measurements, designs, and discussions.
    This internship store receives an average of more than 2,700 customers every day, and the business is also very good. The turnover for the recent weekend and Sunday reached more than 8,000 yuan. Many salespersons have been praised by customers. In the department store, Jia Zhongyu, a third-year student of the Department of Trade Economics, sometimes gets ribbons for international friends and sometimes helps a customer choose a dressing mirror. Shan Bao in the knitwear department has also become an "old expert." Once, an old lady came to buy something. She saw a kind of cotton sweater with a nice color, but thought it was a bit too thick. As she hesitated, Shan Bao struck up a conversation: "Granny! Thicker ones are more durable and absorbent, and they'll be even better after the beginning of autumn." The old lady was very happy: "This girl really knows how to talk," she said, paying with one hand and taking the cotton sweater with the other, walking away happily. Fan Tingzhang, an old salesperson in the store, praised her endlessly.
    The practice of these few days during the summer vacation is rewarding. Everyone feels that being inside and outside the counter is different. Now, they truly realize the importance of commercial work. At the same time, they have a deeper understanding of the study of professional knowledge such as commodity science, trade organization and technology.

    大学生办实习商店
    在北京海淀区双榆树，一个“老店新开”的百货商店吸引着顾客。原来这是中国人民大学贸易经济系的第一实习商店。这里的老顾客都惊奇地感到，仅仅一周时间内，商店的面貌就焕然一新了。针织部的玻璃柜原来排成一字长蛇阵，顾客买东西，必须由售货员从背后的货架上取下来。现在，学生们学习了“天桥”，把一个个玻璃柜分开斜着放，货架敞开了，顾客可以随心所欲地挑选商品。原来在最里面的食品部，为了便利顾客也搬到前边来了，场内还设了新商品专柜。以上这些都是贸易经济系学生经过几次三番地测量场地、设计、讨论以后布置妥贴的。
    这个实习商店，平均每天接待二千七百多名顾客，营业情况也很好。最近的周末和星期日两天营业额就达八千多元。好多售货员受到了顾客的表扬。在百货部里，贸易经济系三年级学生贾忠玉一会儿给国际友人拿缎带；一会儿帮助一位顾客挑选穿衣镜。针织部里的珊宝也快成“老内行”了。一次，有一位老大娘来买东西，她看到一种棉毛衫颜色挺好，就是嫌太厚一点，正在犹疑不决，珊宝就趁此搭话了：“大娘！厚一点耐穿，吸汗，待立秋后就更合适了。”老大娘乐的不行：“这闺女真会说话”，说着一手付款，一手拿了棉毛衫，高高兴兴地走了。这个商店的老售货员范庭章一旁见了称赞不已。
    暑假里几天的实践，收获是丰富的，大伙感到站在柜台里面和柜台外面，心情毕竟不一样。现在，他们才真正体会到商业工作的重要性。同时对商品学、贸易组织和技术等专业知识的学习也更加深切了。
