Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 2nd. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles again threatened armed intervention in Lebanon at a press conference held on the 1st. When talking about the situation in Lebanon, he expressed satisfaction with the activities of the United Nations on this issue. However, he went on to say that he did not think it was enough for the United Nations to take action alone. Dulles once again threatened that if the actions of the United Nations did not yield results, the United States might consider sending its armed forces to Lebanon in accordance with "new circumstances." He said that although the path chosen by the United Nations was the "normal" way to resolve the current conflict in Lebanon, the United States never considered this the only way to resolve the conflict.

In answering questions raised by reporters, Dulles attempted to forget the lessons of the Suez Canal incident for the imperialists and said that the past armed intervention in Egypt by British, French, and Israeli troops could not be compared with a possible armed intervention in Lebanon.

When talking about the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, Dulles tried to shirk the responsibility of the U.S. side for bringing the negotiations to the brink of collapse. It seems that the U.S. authorities' conspiracy to delay the negotiations has been fully exposed by the Chinese government's statement on June 30. Dulles had to say that the United States had not given up the intention of negotiating. The United States suggested that the negotiations be moved to Warsaw and stated that if China agreed to hold the talks in Warsaw, the United States would appoint its ambassador to Warsaw to be the representative for negotiations with China, but he also said that the United States would not bow to the fifteen-day ultimatum in China's statement.

Dulles was unable to answer the question raised by reporters as to why the United States had been slow to appoint an ambassador to negotiate with the Chinese representative. He even said that currently, it was the Chinese government's statement that was delaying the matter, because when the United States received the Chinese statement, it had just prepared a document suggesting changing the location of the negotiations. This document was also said to be "in the process of being sent."

When talking about the Geneva technical negotiations on the issue of implementing supervision of the cessation of nuclear tests, Dulles emphasized that the United States still regards the Geneva negotiations as "purely technical" expert negotiations. He believes that this negotiation should not involve any political decisions.

When talking about other questions raised by reporters, Dulles admitted that the embargo policy has been criticized by U.S. allies.

### 杜勒斯信口雌黄  妄图推卸中断中美会谈的责任

    杜勒斯信口雌黄
    妄图推卸中断中美会谈的责任
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在1日举行的记者招待会上又威胁要对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉。他在谈到黎巴嫩局势的时候，对联合国在这个问题上的活动表示满意。但是，他接着表示，他认为单靠联合国采取行动是不够的。杜勒斯再一次威胁说，如果联合国的行动没有结果的话，美国就有可能按照“新的情况”考虑把它的武装部队派往黎巴嫩。他说，虽然联合国选择的途径是解决黎巴嫩当前冲突的“正常”途径，但是美国从来不认为这是解决冲突的唯一方法。
    杜勒斯在答复记者们提出的问题时，企图忘记苏伊士事件对帝国主义分子的教训，他说，根本不能把过去英、法、以军队对埃及的武装干涉同对黎巴嫩的可能的武装干涉相提并论。
    杜勒斯在谈到中美两国大使级代表会谈的时候，力图推卸美方使谈判濒于破裂的责任。看来美国当局拖延谈判的阴谋已经被中国政府6月30日的声明揭露无遗，杜勒斯只得表示美国没有放弃谈判的意思，美国建议谈判移至华沙举行，并且表示如果中国同意会谈在华沙举行，美国将指派它驻华沙的大使担任同中国谈判的代表，但是他又说美国不会向中国声明中十五天限期的最后通牒低头。
    杜勒斯没有能就记者提出的美国为什么迟迟不指派一个大使同中国代表谈判的问题作出答复，他竟然说，目前，推迟这件事情的是中国政府的声明，因为在收到中国的声明的时候，美国恰好已经准备了一份建议改变谈判地点的文件。这份文件并且据说“正在发送的过程中”。
    杜勒斯在谈到关于就停止核试验实行监督问题的日内瓦技术谈判时强调，美国仍然把日内瓦谈判看作“纯技术性的”专家谈判，他认为，这次谈判不应该涉及任何政治性决议。
    杜勒斯在谈到记者们提出的其他问题时承认，禁运政策遭到美国盟国的批评。
