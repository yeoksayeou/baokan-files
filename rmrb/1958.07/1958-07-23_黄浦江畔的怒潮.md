　　The Raging Tide on the Bund
　　By our staff reporter
    The wave of Shanghai people opposing the armed aggression of the Middle East by US and British imperialism has reached a boiling point. In recent days, on the Bund, a stream of demonstrators has surged day and night. Gray-haired old ladies, Young Pioneers wearing red scarves, workers just off shift, nurses in white uniforms..., all with angry hearts, have left their workshops, classrooms, homes, and offices, and flooded the streets. Many people have come to the office of the Shanghai Consul of the British Chargé d'Affaires in China to solemnly protest the atrocities of US and British imperialism. The people of Shanghai, who have fought against imperialism for nearly a century, understand best the value of national independence and freedom, and also understand that the only way to crush these crazy colonialists is to resolutely fight them to the end.
    Old Shanghai workers, who have bravely fought against US and British imperialism in arduous and bloody struggles, are the most active fighters in this resolute opposition to imperialist aggression in the Middle East. Yang Fulin, the captain of the Shanghai workers' "Tiger-fighting Team," who participated in the three armed uprisings of Shanghai workers and the "May 30th" Movement more than thirty years ago, and who once used his accurate marksmanship to severely strike the imperialists and their running dogs who enslaved the people, and his old comrades-in-arms Sun Desheng, Zhu Yingru, Miao Longjiang, Li Shiliang and others, were extremely angry when they heard that the US and British imperialists, who had been driven away by the Chinese people, had once again extended their claws to the Arab people. Although their bodies had suffered great damage in the past, they could not help but run around to publicize, and participate in rallies and demonstrations with the young people, using their personal experiences to educate young workers, students, Young Pioneers, and neighborhood residents to persevere in their struggle against US and British imperialism. They said excitedly: We must never allow the imperialists to run rampant on Arab land, and we must never let the Arab people suffer the hardships we have experienced. The Chinese people, who have stood up, must do their utmost to support the struggle of our Arab brothers.
    "We hope to live in peace, we do not want war, but we are not afraid of war!" At a symposium held at the Shanghai Tongyi Cotton Mill, Wang Wenbiao, a worker in the carding workshop, expressed the determination of all the factory's employees to oppose US and British imperialist aggression with his steely voice. Five years ago, Wang Wenbiao stood up and fought against the US aggressors on the Korean battlefield. In the world-shaking Battle of Shangganling, he and his comrades-in-arms destroyed two US imperialist tanks. When he heard that US imperialism had once again ignited the flames of war in the Middle East, he wished he could grow wings and fly to the Middle East to give them a good beating. Together with more than a hundred veterans in the factory, he wrote a letter of protest and personally delivered it to the Shanghai Consul of the British Chargé d'Affaires in China. Wang Wenbiao said: "We must fight the imperialists fiercely. In Korea, it was only after a hard struggle that we forced the US imperialists to obediently sign the armistice agreement."
    The piratical acts of US and British aggression in the Middle East have also excited the innocent children. More than six hundred Young Pioneers from all corners of the city gathered on the lawn of the Children's Palace. They braved the scorching sun and sang "Support Arab Children" and other songs they collectively wrote, such as "Drive the Aggressors into the Sea," over and over again. Their singing merged with the roars of millions of demonstrators on the streets, which is the voice of the Young Pioneers, and also the voice of more than two million children in the city. "The power of peace is boundless, drive the aggressors into the sea!" In their young hearts, they also know how to deal with those man-eating jackals.
    Du Qian, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai National Defense Sports Association, who returned from a visit to Lebanon, conveyed to the people of Shanghai the strong will of the Lebanese people to fight against imperialism: in the suburbs of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, there are nineteen steles, each engraved with the date of the imperialist invasion of Lebanon. The imperialists had landed here eighteen times and were driven away by the Lebanese people eighteen times. In August 1946, the French colonial army was driven away, and the nineteenth stele was erected. The Lebanese people, with their glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, all the people of Shanghai, all of China, and all the people of the world are supporting you! There is an ancient Chinese saying: "When a thousand fingers point, even the healthy will die." US and British imperialists will surely suffer the most shameful defeat. The Lebanese people will surely erect the last stele to drive away the imperialists! This is the common wish of the seven million people of Shanghai.

　　黄浦江畔的怒潮
　　本报记者
    上海人民反对美英帝国主义武装侵略中东的浪潮达到了沸点。几天来，黄浦江畔，日日夜夜奔腾着游行示威的人流。白发苍苍的老太太，围着红领巾的少先队员，刚下班的工人，穿着白衣服的护士……，所有的人都怀着愤怒的心情，走出车间、走出课堂、走出家庭、走出办公室，涌向街道。许多人来到英国驻华代办处驻上海参赞办公处所，严正地抗议美英帝国主义的暴行。和帝国主义斗争了将近一个世纪的上海人民，最懂得民族独立和自由的可贵，也最懂得粉碎这些疯狂的殖民主义者的唯一办法，就是和他们坚决斗争到底。
    在艰苦的流血斗争中，英勇地和美英帝国主义较量过的上海老工人，是这次坚决反对帝国主义侵略中东的最活跃的战士。三十多年前上海工人三次武装起义和“五三”斗争参加者、曾经用百发百中的枪法，狠狠地打击过奴役人民的帝国主义者及其走狗的上海工人“打虎队”队长杨福林，和他当年的老战友孙得胜、朱英如、缪龙江、李世良等人，听说被中国人民赶跑了的美英帝国主义又向阿拉伯人民伸出魔掌，他们气愤极了。虽然身体过去受到很大的摧残，他们也禁不住到处奔走宣传，和青年人一道参加集会和游行示威，用他们亲身的经历，教育青年工人、学生、少先队员、里弄居民们，要坚持不懈地和美英帝国主义作斗争。他们激动地说：绝不能容许帝国主义者跑到阿拉伯土地上横行霸道，绝不能让阿拉伯人民再受到我们经历过的苦难。站起来了的中国人民，一定要尽最大的努力，支援阿拉伯兄弟的斗争。
    “我们希望过和平生活，我们不希望战争，但我们绝不害怕战争！”在上海统益棉纺织厂举行的座谈会上，清花车间工人王文彪用他那钢铁般的声音，愤慨地表达了全厂职工反对美英帝国主义侵略的决心。五年以前，王文彪在朝鲜战场上，挺身同美国侵略者较量过，在震动世界的上甘岭战役中，他和他的战友一起炸毁过两辆美帝国主义的坦克。当他听到美帝国主义又在中东燃起战火，恨不得插上翅膀飞到中东去，狠狠揍他们一顿。他和全厂一百多个复员军人一起，写了一份抗议书，亲自送到英国驻华代办处驻上海参赞办公处所。王文彪说：“对帝国主义一定要狠狠地斗争，我们在朝鲜，就是经过艰苦斗争才打得美帝国主义服服贴贴地在停战协议上签了字的。”
    美英侵略中东的海盗行为，也激动着天真幼小的孩子们。六百多个少先队员们从全市的各个角落聚集在少年宫的草坪上，他们冒着烈日，一遍又一遍地唱着：“支援阿拉伯小朋友”和他们自己集体编写的“把侵略者赶下海”等歌曲。他们的歌声同马路上千百万示威者的吼声汇成一片，这是少先队员的声音，也是全市二百多万少年儿童的声音。“和平力量大无边，把侵略者赶下海！”在他们幼小的心灵里，也知道应当怎样对付那些吃人的豺狼。
    从黎巴嫩访问归来的上海国防体育协会副主席杜前，向上海人民传达了黎巴嫩人民反帝斗争的坚强意志：在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特的郊区，树立着十九块石碑，每块石碑上都刻着帝国主义侵入黎巴嫩的日期。帝国主义曾经在这里登陆十八次，被黎巴嫩人民赶走了十八次。1946年8月，法国殖民军被赶走了，便建立了第十九块石碑。有着反帝斗争光荣传统的黎巴嫩人民，全上海、全中国、全世界的人民都在支持你们！中国古语说：“千夫所指，无疾而终。”美英帝国主义者必定会遭到最可耻的失败。黎巴嫩人民一定会树立起赶走帝国主义的最后一块石碑！这是上海七百万人民的共同愿望。
