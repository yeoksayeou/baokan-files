See Which Province's Saplings Survive Best
Guizhou Uses the Spirit of Planting Crops to Nurture Young Forests, Achieving a Survival Rate of Over 80%

(Our Dispatch) Guizhou has fully launched the tending of young forests as rice transplanting nears its end.

Since last winter, Guizhou Province has afforested a total of over 43 million mu, averaging nearly 2.7 mu per person. Judging from the current growth situation, the survival rate is over 80%, with some counties reaching over 85%. In order to consolidate the achievements in afforestation, leaders at all levels and the broad masses have learned from past lessons where the lack of proper tending resulted in water and fertilizer shortages for the saplings, rampant weeds in the forest land, and the withering and death of a large number of saplings. Special emphasis has been placed on the tending of young forests. Leaders at all levels have incorporated forestry production and afforestation into their regular work agenda and formulated annual tending plans. Agricultural cooperatives with a large proportion of forestry production have established dedicated forestry production teams and cooperative directors in charge of forestry. Some areas have put forward the slogan "Planting trees should be like planting crops." When a delegation from another province visited Jinping County to observe the afforestation situation, they said, "Afforestation here is as meticulous as tending a vegetable garden." They not only watered and earthed up the young trees but also fertilized them. Before rice transplanting, Jinping County had already completed the first round of tending for all 700,000 mu of newly afforested land. In late June, they began the second round of tending, and all 420,000 mu of intercropped forest and grain land have been sown with crops, of which 100,000 mu have been deep-plowed to a depth of 1.5 feet. Sinan County mobilized 120,000 laborers to carry out a concentrated tending of young forests, completing the tending of 800,000 mu, and is preparing to fertilize 400,000 mu of economic forests. Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, which ranks first in the province in afforestation achievements, has completed the tending of 7.5 million mu of newly afforested land.

In February of this year, Zunyi County organized a youth expedition team of over 10,000 people, following in the footsteps of the Red Army, and with soaring enthusiasm, afforested over 40,000 mu on the banks of the Wu River in four days. They then moved to Lou Mountain Pass, where the Red Army's Long March wrote a glorious page, and afforested over 50,000 mu. To enable these saplings to quickly become forests, the Zunyi County Party Committee originally planned to mobilize 10,000 young people to the banks of the Wu River and Lou Mountain Pass to tend the young forests. As a result, 15,000 people arrived. Now, these 15,000 young people are tending the saplings they planted with their own hands in two locations.

Currently, a high tide of tending young forests has been launched throughout the province. As of July 3, over 14 million mu have been tended, accounting for over 33% of all newly afforested land. The competition slogan of "See who afforests more" has been transformed into the competition slogan of "See whose saplings survive best and grow fastest."

### 看哪省树苗活得多  贵州用种庄稼的精神抚育幼林，成活率达80％以上

    看哪省树苗活得多
    贵州用种庄稼的精神抚育幼林，成活率达80％以上
    本报讯　贵州在插秧即将结束时全面展开了对幼林的抚育工作。
    贵州省从去冬以来共造林四千三百多万亩，平均每人造林将近二亩七分地。从目前生长情况看，成活率达80％以上，有些县达85％以上。为巩固造林成绩，各级领导与广大群众接受过去由于抚育工作没很好进行，使树苗缺水少肥，林地杂草丛生，造成大量树苗萎缩枯死的教训，特别重视了对幼林的抚育。各级领导都把林业生产、造林绿化纳入经常工作日程，订出全年抚育计划。林业生产比重较大的农业社都设有专门的林业生产队和专管林业的社主任。有些地区提出“种树要像种庄稼”的口号。外省代表团到锦屏县参观造林情况时说“这里造林跟侍弄菜园子一样细致”，他们不但给幼林浇水、培土，而且还给幼林施肥。锦屏县在插秧以前就已将七十万亩新造林全部抚育完头遍，在6月下旬又开始抚育二遍，有四十二万亩林粮混作地已全部播种了庄稼，其中有十万亩深耕了一尺五寸。思南县动员了十二万个劳动力，突击抚育幼林，已抚育完八十万亩，还正准备给四十万亩经济林木施肥。造林成绩居全省首位的黔东南苗族侗族自治州，已抚育完新造林七百五十万亩。
    今年2月间，遵义县组织万余青年远征队，踏着当年红军的足迹，以冲天干劲，用四天时间在乌江岸上造林四万多亩。随即又转战在红军长征史上写下光荣一页的娄山关，造林五万多亩。为使这些幼苗迅速成林，中共遵义县委原计划动员一万名青年到乌江岸与娄山关进行幼林抚育，结果到了一万五千人。现在这一万五千名青年正分两地抚育他们亲手栽下去的幼苗。
    目前，抚育幼林的高潮已在全省范围内展开，至7月3日已抚育一千四百多万亩，达全部新造林的33％以上。“看谁造林多”的竞赛口号，已变成“看谁的树苗活得多，长得快”的竞赛口号了。
