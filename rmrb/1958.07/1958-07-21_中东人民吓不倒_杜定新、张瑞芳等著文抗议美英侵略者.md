Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 20th. Du Dingxin, a female textile worker at the Shanghai State-owned No. 1 Cotton Factory, and film actress Zhang Ruifang, who had both visited Middle Eastern countries, published articles in the "Liberation Daily" on the 19th, lodging a serious protest against the imperialist acts of aggression.

Du Dingxin visited Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, in 1956. She wrote: When the Lebanese youth learned that we were the Chinese people who resolutely opposed imperialism, they warmly shook our hands and spoke endlessly about their hatred for imperialism. Now the American robbers are invading this beautiful city. But we believe that the Lebanese people cannot be intimidated, and the people of the world are supporting them. She then wrote: "As a worker, in addition to morally supporting them, I will also support the Lebanese people's struggle with practical actions to complete production tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical way."

Famous film actress Zhang Ruifang published an article entitled "Destruction Awaits the Aggressors," saying that she had visited Egypt in December last year while attending the Asian-African Solidarity Conference. Only a few months later, the American and British imperialists are again endangering the peace of Asia, Africa, and the world with armed aggression. She believes that the heroic Arab people will resolutely strike at imperialism.

Famous figures in Shanghai's literary and art circles, including Ba Jin, Zhou Erfu, Zhang Jin, Yu Ling, He Luting, Zhou Xiaoyan, etc., also jointly wrote articles to newspapers, protesting against the American and British imperialist interference in Arab internal affairs, and unanimously stated that they could not stand idly by in the face of such robber-like acts of aggression. In just three days, they have rushed to write and compile many crosstalk, clapper talk, songs, living newspapers, and other programs, powerfully expressing the Shanghai people's enthusiasm and determination to support the just struggle of the Arab people.

    中东人民吓不倒
    杜定新、张瑞芳等著文抗议美英侵略者
    新华社上海20日电  曾经访问过中东国家的上海国棉一厂挡车女工杜定新和电影演员张瑞芳19日在“解放日报”上发表文章，对帝国主义的侵略行为提出严重抗议。
    杜定新在1956年访问过黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特。她写道：当黎巴嫩青年知道我们是坚决反对帝国主义的中国人民时，就热烈地同我们握手，还滔滔不绝地向我们谈到他们对帝国主义的仇恨的情形。现在美国强盗正在侵略这个美丽的城市。但是我们相信，黎巴嫩人民是吓不倒的，全世界人民都在支持他们。她接着写道：“我作为一个工人，除了在道义上声援外，还要以多、快、好、省地完成生产任务的实际行动支援黎巴嫩人民的斗争。”
    著名电影演员张瑞芳以“灭亡在等待着侵略者”为题发表文章说，她曾在去年12月参加亚非团结大会时到过埃及。事隔才几个月，美、英帝国主义又以武装侵略来危害亚非和世界的和平。她相信英勇的阿拉伯人民一定会给帝国主义以坚决的打击。
    上海文艺界著名人士巴金、周而复、章靳以、于伶、贺绿汀、周小燕等也都纷纷联名给报纸写文章，抗议美英帝国主义干涉阿拉伯内政，并一致表示对这种强盗的侵略行为不能袖手旁观。在短短的三天内，他们已赶写、赶编出许多相声、快板、歌曲、活报等节目，有力地表达了上海人民支持阿拉伯人民正义斗争的热情和意志。
