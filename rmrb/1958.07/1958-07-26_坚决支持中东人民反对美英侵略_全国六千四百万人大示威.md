Xinhua News Agency, July 25th. The Chinese people resolutely protest against the heinous crimes of American and British imperialism in creating war. People in almost all cities across the country have launched a surging protest and demonstration movement against aggression and in defense of peace. This is an unprecedented national demonstration. According to preliminary statistics today, 64 million people in more than 2,000 cities and some large market towns across the country held large-scale demonstrations and protest rallies. There were also marches and rallies in the vast rural areas.

The protest and demonstration movement was so widespread that even on the most remote coastal islands, in southern Xinjiang and Tibet, and in the mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in Yunnan and Guizhou, demonstrations and protests were held. In ten cities in Liaoning Province, 3 million people held protest rallies and demonstrations.

In Yunnan Province's Dehong, Xishuangbanna, Honghe minority autonomous prefectures and 82 counties including Yuxi in the interior, more than 1.6 million people of all ethnic groups held protest demonstrations. In Yanji City, Jilin Province, many demobilized veterans of the Volunteer Army specially organized accusation groups to accuse the U.S. military of atrocities in Korea. Their accusations aroused the righteous indignation of the broad masses of the people against the enemy. In the southwest and northwest regions, many geological workers working in the deep mountains also held rallies to protest after hearing the news.

The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the front lines of national defense, as well as the people of coastal ports and islands in Fujian and Zhejiang, have been closely watching the activities of the U.S. military occupying China's territory of Taiwan in recent days. They angrily gathered to protest the crimes of American and British imperialism in armed aggression in the Middle East attempting to provoke war, demanding "American and British aggressors get out of the Middle East!" and "American troops get out of Taiwan!" The people of the two seaports of Shenjiamen and Haimen in Zhejiang held a protest meeting of more than 10,000 people. They vigilantly defended the coast and expressed their determination to assist the Chinese People's Liberation Army in striking and eliminating any enemies who dared to invade at any time.

The upsurge of opposition to aggression and the great leap forward in production and construction have formed two surging waves. In seven small and medium-sized cities in Heilongjiang Province, nearly one million machinery workers, miners, and lumber workers held protest rallies together with the local people. The workers proposed to increase the strength to defend peace with a new leap forward in production. The masses who were conducting intensive flood prevention work along the Han River in Hubei Province carried iron shovels and held rallies and marches on the construction site. They expressed their determination to ensure victory over the floods and strive for a bumper harvest to strengthen the forces of defending peace. In the protests of the people of Henan Province, many units have revised their leap forward plans, and the time for completing the flood control and power generation of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project has been decided to be greatly advanced. All employees of the Luoyang Tractor Factory proposed to double the production tasks for the second half of the year. More than 3,000 employees of cotton textile printing and dyeing factories in Jiangxi Province have been overfulfilling their production plans for days while holding protest rallies; the employees of this factory have also put forward a large number of suggestions for technological innovation. The workers in the steelmaking workshop of the Luda Steel Plant said: The national great leap forward in construction and the defense of world peace both need steel, and we must turn our anger into strength. This workshop produced 29 tons of steel more on the 18th and increased it to 34 tons of steel on the 19th. Coal miners in Benxi, Fushun, and Fuxin have stepped up production. Coal miners in Fuxin proposed to show their strength by achieving high-yield days and weeks and overfulfilling the July leap forward plan. Fushun coal miners decided to launch four high-yield day activities in July to express their support for the Arab people. In the suburbs of Changchun, 180,000 farmers held field meetings and decided to shorten the task of completing water conservancy projects in three years to three months, so as to greatly improve production.

In Hebei, Heilongjiang, Wuhan, Ningxia, and other regions, many small and medium-sized cities have also launched signature campaigns to support the people of the Middle East and protest against American and British aggression.

    坚决支持中东人民反对美英侵略
    全国六千四百万人大示威
    据新华社25日讯　全中国人民坚决抗议美英帝国主义制造战争的滔天罪行，几乎全国所有城市的人民，都掀起了一个波涛汹涌的反对侵略、保卫和平的抗议示威运动。这是一次规模空前的全民大示威。根据今天的初步统计，在全国二千多个城市和一部分大的集镇中，有六千四百万人举行了声势浩大的示威游行和抗议集会活动。在广大农村也有游行集会活动。
    抗议示威运动是这样的广泛，甚至在最偏僻的沿海岛屿上，在遥远的新疆南部和西藏，在云贵高原少数民族聚居的山区，也都举行了示威抗议活动。在辽宁省的十个城市中，就有三百万人举行了抗议集会和示威游行。
    在云南省边疆的德宏、西双版纳、红河等少数民族自治州和内地玉溪等八十二个县，有一百六十多万各族人民举行了抗议示威活动。吉林省的延吉市，许多志愿军复员军人专门组织了控诉团，控诉美军在朝鲜的暴行，他们的控诉激起了广大人民对敌人的义愤。在西南和西北地区，许多在深山中工作的地质工作人员，听到消息以后，也都集会抗议。
    海防前线的中国人民解放军官兵以及福建和浙江海港及岛屿上的人民，这几天来密切注视着美军侵占的我国领土台湾的活动，他们愤怒地集会抗议美英帝国主义武装侵略中东企图挑起战争的罪行，要求“美英侵略者滚出中东！”“美国军队滚出台湾！”浙江沈家门和海门两个海港的人民举行了一万多人的抗议大会，他们警惕地保卫着海防，表示要协助中国人民解放军随时打击和消灭敢于来犯的敌人。
    反对侵略和生产建设的跃进，形成两个澎湃的浪潮。在黑龙江省的七个中小城市里，有近百万机械工人、矿工、伐木工人同当地人民一道举行了抗议集会活动，工人们提出要以新的生产跃进来增加保卫和平的力量。正在湖北省汉江沿岸进行紧张防洪的群众，扛着铁锨在工地上集会游行，他们表示一定要保证战胜洪水，力争粮食大丰收，以壮大保卫和平的力量。在河南省人民的抗议声中，许多单位纷纷修改了跃进规划，三门峡水利枢纽工程完成拦洪和发电的时间，已决定要大大地提前。洛阳拖拉机厂全体职工提出要加倍地增加下半年的生产任务。江西省的棉纺织印染厂三千多名职工，在举行抗议集会的同时，连日超额完成生产计划；这个厂的职工并且提出了大批技术革新的建议。旅大钢厂炼钢车间的工人们说：全国建设大跃进和保卫世界和平都需要钢铁，我们一定要把愤怒化为力量。这个车间在18日多炼出了二十九吨钢，19日又增到三十四吨钢。本溪、抚顺、阜新的煤矿工人，都加紧了生产，阜新的煤矿工人提出了要用实现高产日、高产周，超额完成7月份的跃进计划来显示自己的力量。抚顺煤矿工人决定在7月份内开展四个高产日活动，表示对阿拉伯人民的声援。长春市郊有十八万农民举行了地头会，他们决定要把三年完成的水利化任务缩短为三个月来完成，以此来把生产大大提高一步。
  河北、黑龙江、武汉、宁夏等地区，许多中小城市还掀起了声援中东人民、抗议美英侵略的签名运动。
