    Anti-Drought Battle Songs (and one other)	Jiang Weipu
    Chiseling mountain springs from the stone,
    Every celestial river opens on the mountain;
    Dragon spits water upon the cornucopia,
    Golden flowers and silver trees planted all over the mountain.
    Not afraid of the wind drying the land,
    Erecting windmills to fight the drought,
    Whether big wind or small wind wants to cross the mountain,
    It must leave behind money for the road!
    Reservoirs all over the mountain, wells everywhere,
    Rivers and lakes all obey orders,
    Ensuring a good harvest even after three years of drought,
    Competing with the Dragon King in supernatural powers!

    Eighteen Sisters Compete with Zhuge Liang
    Eighteen sisters go to water the fields,
    Eighteen people divided into three shifts,
    Pulling the waterwheel, spinning like a whirlwind,
    Resolutely fighting the drought to ensure a bumper harvest.
    The waterwheel was pulled for three whole days,
    The eighteen sisters' waists aching,
    Taking advantage of the sun setting in the west,
    They encircled the well curb.
    To surpass the Dragon King, not relying on heaven,
    Unwilling to leave the tools as they are;
    Even if the difficulties are like a mountain,
    Eighteen hands will overturn it!
    Eighteen minds thinking of ideas,
    Thirty-six eyes shining brightly;
    Axes and saws ringing in the first half of the night,
    Major waterwheel modification in the second half.
    Before dawn, people run to see,
    The waterwheel becomes a "sky-turning wheel";
    （Note）The eighteen sisters smile cheerfully, eighteen people doing the work of four. The "sky-turning wheel" is installed with several sets, completing ten days of work in two days; the eighteen sisters compete with Zhuge Liang, praised by thousands and tens of thousands!

    Note: The "sky-turning wheel" is a type of waterwheel improved by the masses. The liberation-style waterwheel, originally requiring three or four or five or six people to pull, can save two-thirds to three-quarters of the labor force after being modified into a "sky-turning wheel."

    抗旱战歌（外一首）	姜维朴
    石板凿出山泉来，
    条条天河山上开；
    聚宝盆上龙吐水，
    金花银树遍山栽。
    不怕风吹土地干，
    架起风车来抗旱，
    大风小风要过山，
    要它留下买路钱！
    遍山水库遍地井，
    江河湖泊都听命，
    大旱三年保丰收，
    要和龙王比神通！
    十八姊妹赛诸葛
    十八姊妹去浇田，
    十八人分三班，
    拉着水车旋风转，
    坚决抗旱保丰产。
    水车拉了整三天，
    十八姊妹腰发酸，
    趁着太阳落西山，
    井崖上围了一圈圈。
    要赛过龙王不靠天，
    工具不改心不甘；
    哪怕困难似座山，
    十八双手把它掀！
    十八颗心里想主张，
    三十六只眼睛闪光芒；
    前半夜斧头锯子响，
    后半夜水车大改装。
    天不亮人们跑来看，
    水车变成“拨天转”；
      （注）十八姊妹笑呵呵，十八人活儿四人干。“拨天转”装起好几盘，十天活儿两天完；十八姊妹赛诸葛，千人万人齐夸赞！
    注：“拨天转”是一种经群众改进的水车，原需要三四个或五六个人拉的解放式水车，改成“拨天转”以后可以节省三分之二和四分之三的劳力。
