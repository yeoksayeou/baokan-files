    Wuxi Creates Continuous Bleaching and Scouring Machine
    Cotton Fabric Printing and Dyeing Saves Eight Processes
    (Our dispatch) The workers of the printing and dyeing workshop of the Wuxi Lixin Textile Factory have recently trial-produced a continuous bleaching and scouring machine. In the past, printing and dyeing cotton fabrics required processes such as singeing, desizing, boiling, bleaching, acid washing, water washing, opening, squeezing, drying, and mercerizing. Now, this has been changed to direct mercerizing after singeing, shortening the process by eight steps. Working hours have also been reduced from about fifty hours to half an hour, increasing work efficiency by nearly a hundredfold. At the same time, a large amount of equipment, factory buildings, printing and dyeing materials, and labor can be saved.

    无锡创造漂炼连续机
    印染棉布省八道工序
    本报讯  无锡丽新纺织厂印染车间的职工，最近试制成漂炼连续机。过去，印染棉布需要经过烧毛、退浆、煮炼、漂白、汰酸、水洗、开幅、轧水、烘干、丝光等工序，现在一变而为烧毛后直接到丝光工序，缩短工序八道；工时也从原来的五十小时左右缩短为半小时；工作效率提高近百倍；同时，可以节省大量设备、厂房、印染原料和劳动力。
