Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Tokyo: The Standing Council of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, at a meeting held today, decided to launch a movement to abolish the so-called "Japan-Chiang Treaty" signed between the Japanese government and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, in order to eliminate obstacles to the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

The meeting decided that the movement will actively expose the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China and shatter some of the fallacies and deceptive statements recently spread by the Kishi Nobusuke group. The meeting also called on all groups participating in the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations to unite, concentrate the people's strength, and urge the Kishi Nobusuke government to change its policy.
