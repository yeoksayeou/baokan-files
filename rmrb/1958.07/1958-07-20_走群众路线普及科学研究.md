Taking the Mass Line to Popularize Scientific Research
	Jin Wen

	The phenomenon of factories, agricultural cooperatives, townships, and counties engaging in large-scale scientific research is already quite common. There are also two provinces that are universally engaged in scientific research. One is Shaanxi Province, which was reported in this newspaper not long ago; the other is Zhejiang Province, which is being reported today. This newspaper has already published an editorial about the case of Shaanxi Province and conducted discussions. Regarding the experience of Zhejiang Province, we will say a few more words here to draw the attention of various regions and departments.

	Zhejiang Province has engaged in large-scale scientific research throughout the province, establishing more than 10,000 scientific and technological research institutions, forming a vast research network. This fully demonstrates that the popularization of science is not only needed by the masses but is also achievable. The question is how to do it?

	The mass line is invincible. Everyone knows this is a truth. But why have some regions and departments applied this truth to great effect, making significant progress in their work, while other regions and departments have not done so, keeping the mass line only on their lips?

	Those who have not taken the mass line also believe that the "mass line" is a magic weapon. They praise it with a smile: "Ah, good arrow, good arrow!" Praising it as a dead dogma, but not actually using it. They dare not let go and mobilize the masses, fearing that it will be chaotic and messed up, so they are unable to move forward and remain stagnant.

	The attitude of the Zhejiang Provincial Party organization towards popularizing scientific research work is to adopt a method that truly follows the mass line. They regard the mass line as a method to solve practical problems. They decide to do something and do it immediately. They dare to rely on the masses and mobilize them, and when they encounter difficulties, they consult with the masses to solve them. The Party leadership, local experts, and foreign experts in Zhejiang Province combined, got started first, and then found ways to overcome difficulties and create conditions. As a result, a large number of local experts in various industries have emerged, and their enthusiasm is extremely high.

	From the practice of Zhejiang Province, it can be seen that with politics in command, local experts as the backbone, and foreign experts assisting in solving problems, the great role of scientific research can be greatly brought into play. The Party leadership in Zhejiang Province has planted a bright red flag in the scientific research work of combining local and foreign experts, adhering to the direction of scientific research serving production. The result is: the combination of book knowledge and practical production experience has led to the growth of a large number of new-type experts.

	Taking the mass line, combining the Party committee, local experts, and foreign experts, is a good method for popularizing scientific research, and it is also a good method for other aspects of the cultural revolution. As long as it is truly put into practice, amazing results can be achieved.

    走群众路线普及科学研究
    金文
    一个工厂，一个农业社，一个乡，一个县大搞科学研究的事已经不少。一个省普遍搞科学研究的事也有了两个。一个是不久以前本报报道过的陕西省；一个是今天报道的浙江省。关于陕西省的事例，本报已发表了社论，进行过探讨。对于浙江省的经验，我们在这里再说几句，以引起各地各部门的注意。
    浙江省在全省范围内大搞科学研究，建立了科学技术研究机构一万多个，形成了一个庞大的研究网。这充分说明了科学大普及不仅是群众所需要，也是可以办到的。问题是在于怎样去做？
    走群众路线，无往不胜。人们都知道这是真理。可是为什么有的地区、有的部门应用这一真理发挥了很大的威力，使工作发生显著成效；而另外一些地区、另外一些部门还没有这样做，而把群众路线只停留在口头上呢？
    没有走群众路线的人也认为“群众路线”是法宝。他们笑嘻嘻地称颂：“呵，好箭，好箭！”当作死教条去称赞，却不去实际运用它。他们不敢放手发动群众，怕搞乱了，搞坏了，于是寸步难行，故步自封。
    浙江省党组织对待普及科学研究工作的态度，却是采取了真正走群众路线的方法。他们把群众路线看作是解决实际问题的方法。他们决定要做，就马上去做。他们敢于依靠群众，发动群众，遇到困难，就找群众商量解决。浙江省党的领导、土专家、洋专家三结合，先上马，而后再设法克服困难，创造条件。因而各行各业的土专家不断涌现，情绪极为高涨。
    从浙江省的实践中，可以看到，政治挂帅，土专家作骨干，洋专家协助解决问题，就可以大大发挥科学研究的极大作用。浙江省党的领导在土洋结合的科学研究工作中插上鲜明的红旗，坚持科学研究为生产服务的方向，结果是：书本知识和生产实践经验结合，大量的新型专家成长起来了。
    走群众路线，党委、土专家、洋专家三结合，在普及科学研究方面是好办法，在文化革命的其它方面也同样是好方法，只要真正地去实践，就可以作出惊人的成绩来。
