Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th – The eighth national convention of the Japan-China Friendship Association closed on the 28th.

After three days of heated discussion, the convention unanimously adopted this year's program of activities.

This year's program of activities stipulates that the central task of the current Japan-China friendship movement is to launch a national movement to correct the Nobusuke Kishi government's hostile China policy and eliminate the current tension in Japan-China relations.

The program also decided to strive to encourage people from all walks of life to participate in this movement, especially to make the working class the center of this movement.

The conference decided to designate September and October as the months for eliminating tension in Japan-China relations and strengthening Japan-China friendship.

The convention passed a resolution demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government stop its conspiracy to create "two Chinas," abolish the "Japan-Chiang Treaty," and change its hostile China policy in order to restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

The convention also passed the following resolutions: 1. Demand that the Nobusuke Kishi government restore Japan-China trade relations. 2. A resolution protesting the armed aggression of the United States and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan and supporting the independent struggle of the Arab people. 3. Recognize the joint statement issued on October 28, 1957, by the Japan-China Friendship Association and five other organizations, including the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, on issues such as enhancing friendship between the peoples of the two countries and normalizing Japan-China diplomatic relations. 4. Actively participate in various peace movements. 5. Demand that the Nobusuke Kishi government apologize to the Chinese government for the Liu Lianren incident and compensate Liu Lianren for the losses he suffered. 6. Assist in the repatriation of the remains of Chinese martyrs.

The convention also passed a message to the Chinese people, saying that the convention heard a report from Tokubei Hanayagi, who had just returned from China, and learned that the Chinese people's anger toward the Nobusuke Kishi government was very strong, but that the Chinese people supported the Japanese people's struggle for peace and national independence. It stated that the Japanese people are willing to join hands with the Chinese people to strive for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Asia, to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, and to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations.

The convention elected Jiichiro Matsumoto as the president of the Japan-China Friendship Association, and Kanzo Uchimura, Yoshitaro Hirano, Kaoru Kawasaki, Kaoru Ota, and Eiichi Shukutani as vice presidents.
