Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 12th. Technical renovation projects on seven railway lines in East China have begun. This renovation project is very large in scale, with a total earth and stone volume exceeding ten million cubic meters, and requiring the laying of nearly four hundred kilometers of steel rails.

These railways are the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Pukou-Bengbu, Huainan, Nanjing-Wuhu, and Xiaoshan-Ningbo lines, all under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Railway Administration.

With the rapid advances in national industrial and agricultural production, the freight volume on these railways in the second half of the year is expected to double compared to the first half. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to improve their transportation capacity through technical renovation.

The renovation project on the Nanjing-Bengbu railway line, which connects north-south traffic, started earliest at the end of June, and now more than 20,000 workers and farmers along the line have entered the construction site. The project on this line includes the construction of hump marshalling yards in Nanjing and Pukou, the expansion of Bengbu Station, and the construction and relocation of two stations, respectively. At the same time, slopes will be leveled and the gradient of the line reduced and the curvature decreased between seven stations, and thirty-five kilometers of double track will be laid. When the entire project is completed, the train capacity of this railway will be increased by more than 40% compared to the original.

In the suburbs of Shanghai, the civil engineering for a hump marshalling yard has also begun, and four nearby stations are being expanded simultaneously. Double tracks will be laid between two of these stations, jointly forming a new Shanghai railway hub.

To adapt to the rapid development of local industry in East China, these seven railways will also open up forty-three dedicated lines, directly connecting to newly built steel and machinery factories along the line. On these railways, thirty-eight stations will add sidings and yards for loading and unloading goods, and five other important stations will be expanded.

    华东改造七条铁路线
    铺轨四百公里　增设卸货场地　扩建重要车站
    新华社上海12日电　华东地区七条铁路线的技术改造工程已经开始施工。这项改造工程规模很大，土方和石方总量超过一千万方，需要铺设的钢轨将近四百公里。
    这些铁路是沪宁、沪杭、浙赣、浦（口）埠（蚌）、淮南、宁（南京）芜（湖）和萧（山）甬（宁波）线，属于上海铁路管理局管辖。
    随着全国工农业生产的突飞猛进，这些铁路下半年的货运量预计将比上半年增加一倍。因此，已经迫不及待地需要通过技术改造来提高它们的运输能力。
    连结南北交通的南京——蚌埠间的铁路线改造工程，在6月底最先动工，现在已经有两万多工人和沿线农民进入施工现场。这条线路的工程包括在南京、浦口建设驼峰调车场，扩建蚌埠车站，分别新建和迁移两个车站等；同时，还要在七个车站间削平坡道，降低线路的坡度和缩小弯曲度，铺设长三十五公里的双轨。全部工程完工时，这条铁路的列车通过能力将比原来提高40％以上。
    在上海近郊，一个驼峰编组场的土建工程也已开始，附近的四个车站同时进行扩建；其中两个车站间将铺设双轨，联合组成一个新的上海铁路枢纽。
    适应华东地区地方工业的飞速发展，这七条铁路还将开辟四十三条专用线，直接通到沿线新建的钢铁和机械工厂。在这些铁路上，还有三十八个车站要增设货物装卸的股道和场地，另外五个重要车站要进行扩建。
