    Hot Rolling of Gears Successfully Tested
    Manufacturing Efficiency Increases Thirty to Fifty Times
    The latest international technological achievement in gear manufacturing – hot rolling gears using pressure processing – has recently been successfully tested at the Liming Machinery Factory. This experiment was conducted on equipment modified from ordinary machine tools. Manufacturing gears using the hot rolling method has many advantages. Simply placing the heated blank onto the machine allows for the production of a gear in one and a half to two minutes, increasing efficiency by thirty to fifty times compared to ordinary gear production methods. Only one set of tools is required, saving over 90% of tool costs and conserving a large amount of processing equipment. In the past, gears were produced using milling machines, with a portion of the steel turning into iron filings. Now, the hot rolling method can save 20% of materials. Furthermore, the lifespan of gears produced by hot rolling can be extended by two to three times.
    Hot rolling of gears has been given great importance in various countries, and much research work has been conducted. The Soviet Union has successfully used it in production, manufacturing 850,000 gears in 1956. (Xinhua News Agency)

    热轧齿轮试验成功
    制造工效猛增三十至五十倍
    国际上齿轮制造的最新技术成就——将齿轮用压力加工的方法热轧制成，最近在黎明机械厂试验成功。这个试验是在普通机床改装的设备上进行的。用热轧的方法制造齿轮具有许多优点。只要把加热的毛坯放到机器上，用一分半钟到两分钟就可做成一个齿轮，比普通的齿轮生产方法提高效率三十倍到五十倍；所用工具只要一套，可以节约工具费90％以上，并能节省大批加工设备。过去，生产齿轮用铣床铣，一部分钢材变成铁屑，现在用热轧办法就可以节约材料20％；加热轧成的齿轮，寿命还可以延长两三倍。
    热轧齿轮世界各国都给以很大的重视，进行了许多研究工作。苏联并已成功地用于生产，1956年就生产了八十五万个。　（新华社）
