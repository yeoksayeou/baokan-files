Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 30th. The Aichi Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, has edited two "Farmer Poetry Collections." The first collection, "Selections of Ballads for the Great Leap Forward in Summer Harvest," has already been printed and published, and the second collection is also in print.

During the summer harvest, in order to overcome wind and rain disasters, the No. 2 team of the Fifth Cooperative of Shayuan built a mat shed to thresh wheat day and night. The members composed a quick-rhythm ballad: "The Fifth Cooperative, Second Team, sets out, making camp under the mat shed, launching a surprise attack to thresh wheat with great energy, carrying and threshing like a whirlwind. Genyin surpasses Zhao Zilong, Wanlian resembles Mu Guiying, Huang Zhong does not accept old age, and Zhiyi's children are like Luo Cheng. Forty carts of wheat are finished in the middle of the night, threshing quickly and hitting fiercely, the sound of threshing shakes the sky, alarming the four seas and the heavenly palace, the Wind God and Rain Master are defeated, sending the moon to greet the people." After this quick-rhythm ballad was broadcast, it set off a high tide of rushing to harvest, and cooperatives and teams built sheds for night battles, compiling more than forty quick-rhythm poems that vividly reflected the farmers' struggle against the weather.

    爱池乡两本“农民诗集”出版
    据新华社西安30日电　中共陕西省大荔县爱池乡委员会编辑了两本“农民诗集”，第一集“夏收跃进板歌选”已经油印出版，第二集也已经付印。
    沙苑五社二队在夏收开始，为了战胜风雨灾害，搭起席棚，昼夜摔麦脱粒。社员们就编了一首快板唱道：“五社二队出了征，席棚底下扎大营，突击摔麦劲头大，搬运摔打一阵风。根印赛过赵子龙，菀莲好像穆桂英，黄忠天恩不服老，志义娃娃赛罗成。四十车麦子半夜完，摔的快来打的凶，摔麦响声震天空，惊动四海和天宫，风伯雨师败了阵，送出月亮把人迎。”这个快板广播后，掀起了抢收高潮，各社各队纷纷搭棚夜战，并编出四十多首真实地反映了农民与天气搏斗的生动形象的快板诗。
