    Thirty-Layer Ivory Ball

    A thirty-layer ivory ball, breaking historical records, has recently been successfully carved at the Guangzhou No. 1 Ivory Carving Production Cooperative.

    This ivory ball has five more layers than the Guangzhou ivory ball that won an honorary award at the International Panama Exposition in 1952. It has a diameter of seventeen centimeters, and the surface of the ball is carved with an illustration of a hundred flowers blooming. The inside of the ball is carved through thirty layers, of which sixteen layers are engraved with delicate floral patterns. The ball is supported by a sixty-three-centimeter-long ivory ball column, the lower end of which is an octagonal pavilion.

    三十层的象牙球
    打破历史纪录的三十层象牙球，最近在广州市第一象牙雕刻生产社雕制成功。
    这个象牙球比1952年获得国际巴拿马赛会荣誉奖的广州象牙球还多五层。它的直径有十七公分，球面雕满百花齐放的示意图，球内雕通三十层，其中有十六层都刻上精致的花纹图案。球下用一条六十三公分长的牙球柱支持，球柱下端是一座八角亭。
