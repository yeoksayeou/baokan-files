(Our newspaper, Xi'an, 6th dispatch) The Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, relying on the worker masses to propose technical innovation suggestions, collectively studies, experiments with, and resolves these suggestions, forming a high tide of the technical innovation movement throughout the factory. In less than two months, the factory's employees proposed more than 3,600 technical innovation suggestions, and most of them were promptly addressed, creating more than 430 production records. The factory's output increased by an average of 40%, and quality improved by 38%.

Since the end of March, the factory has held more than 30 technical airing-of-views meetings in workshops and teams, and employees have posted more than 3,000 big-character posters. In less than two months, the technical innovation suggestions put forward by all the factory's employees were equivalent to twenty times the total proposed in the entire previous year.

Those participating in the technical airing-of-views included both experts and non-experts; there were technicians and technical workers, as well as many administrative cadres who did not understand technology. Everyone thought, everyone talked, supplemented each other, and jointly studied, creating a grand meeting of wisdom, solving many key production technology problems. Liu Bingxin, a catering management cadre who had been transferred to the lower levels for less than a year, did not understand how to improve machine technology, but he thought that the handles of enamel pots were manually operated, the specifications and sizes were inconsistent, the quality was poor, and the efficiency was low. During the technical airing-of-views, he suggested using a handle-rolling machine. Veteran technical worker Shi Linge and others studied with him, and it took only more than a month to successfully test the machine-rolled pot handles, which increased work efficiency by seven and a half times compared to manual operation, and the quality was also greatly improved. This factory started producing industrial enamel this year, and the product quality requirements are very strict. They had sent people to fraternal factories to learn how to check for pinholes, using magnifying glasses to check them bit by bit, which was very time-consuming and not reliable. Di Linjie, the secretary of the Party Committee, saw that a pharmaceutical factory used an electrified instrument to check pharmaceutical utensils during a visit, and thought of manufacturing a similar tool to check industrial enamel. After proposing it, technician Jiao Zhen'an only spent a few days researching and trial-producing a high-voltage flaw detector, which increased the inspection work efficiency by twenty times.

In technical airing-of-views and debates, strengths can be drawn upon and weaknesses avoided, and advantages can be concentrated. Many problems that were previously considered unsolvable have been readily solved. This year, the factory's demand for glaze powder has increased by more than double compared to last year, and the supply of glaze powder could not keep up with demand. The leadership suggested whether it was possible to find ways to increase the powder yield. Some cadres believed that it would not be possible to increase production without expanding the factory and adding equipment. Worker Liu Zhihua believed that it was possible to increase the grinding rate because he saw that the millstone was washed with clay every time the powder was ground. The newly washed millstone produced powder quickly, but he did not know why. During the debate, everyone found the reason: it turned out that the stones in the newly washed ball mill had no powder on them, and the impact force was high, so the grinding was fast. The next day, this method was adopted, and work efficiency increased by 40%. Without adding equipment, the glaze powder needed for the entire factory's second and third quarters was satisfied.

In the Great Leap Forward, the employees of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory want to increase the factory's output by more than two times compared to last year, improve quality by 190%, increase the variety of colors by 1,200 kinds, and successfully trial-produce 86 new varieties of industrial enamel. The employees are very enthusiastic and motivated. In the Great Leap Forward, the factory Party Committee found that the main reason for hindering the development of technical innovation in the past was the failure to implement the mass line well. In the past, the method of individual filling out forms and drawing pictures was adopted, and the processing had to go through six or seven procedures, and it took at least a month. Cadres felt that the work was tense, and there was no time to study many suggestions. In response to these problems, the factory leaders advocated that workers propose, research, and solve problems themselves. Any suggestions put forward by the workers are first studied and supplemented by the team. If everyone thinks it is feasible and waste materials can be used for experiments, the team will study and experiment: if it is necessary to spend money to purchase materials or the team cannot solve it, the opinions will be submitted to the workshop: those spending less than 100 yuan will be decided by the workshop: major issues of more than 100 yuan or related to the entire factory will be decided by the factory leadership. In this way, about 70% of the suggestions can be studied, experimented, and solved by the masses themselves; 20% are studied and solved by the workshop, and only 10% of the major suggestions need to be solved by the factory-level leadership. Relying on the strength of the masses, the processing is timely, the results are quick, and it can play a role in production more quickly.

In the debate on developing technical innovation by airing-of-views, the employees criticized some cadres who were afraid of disrupting production; and who were afraid that using the technical airing-of-views form would not be handled well and would affect everyone's emotions, advocating still using the old methods of the past. They unanimously believed that the airing-of-views method can draw on collective wisdom and concentrate everyone's wisdom, making suggestions more complete and thoughtful; at the same time, various opinions put forward for joint discussion will become clearer and clearer through debate.

### 发动群众提建议　依靠群众想办法  西安人民搪瓷厂技术革新效果好

    发动群众提建议　依靠群众想办法
    西安人民搪瓷厂技术革新效果好
    本报西安6日电　西安人民搪瓷厂依靠工人群众，提出革新技术建议，集体研究，试验和解决这些建议，使技术革新运动在全厂范围形成高潮。在不到两个月内，全厂职工共提出三千六百多件技术革新的建议，并且大部分得到及时处理，创造了四百三十多项生产纪录，全厂生产产量平均提高40％，质量提高了38％。
    从三月底以来，这个厂以车间和小组为单位，陆续举行了三十多次技术鸣放会议，职工们贴出三千多张大字报。在不到两个月的时间内，全厂职工提出的技术革新建议，相当于去年全年提出的二十倍。
    参加技术鸣放的有内行也有外行；有技术人员和技术工人，也有很多不懂技术的行政干部。大家想，大家谈，互相补充，共同研究，智慧大会师，解决了不少生产技术关键问题。下放不到一年的伙食管理干部刘秉信不懂改进机器技术，但想到搪瓷锅的把子是手工操作，规格大小不一，质量不好，效率低，技术鸣放时就提出用卷把机的建议，老技术工人师林阁等就和他一起研究，只用了一个多月的时间，用机器卷锅把就试验成功，比手工操作提高工效七倍半，质量也大大提高。这个厂今年开始生产工业搪瓷，产品质量要求非常严格。他们曾派人到兄弟厂学习检查砂眼方法，都是用放大镜一点一点的检查，很费时间，又不保险。党委书记邸林杰在参观制药厂时，看见用一种通电的仪器检查制药器皿，想到制造一个类似的工具检查工业搪瓷，提出后，技工焦振安只几天时间，就研究试制成一部高压探伤仪，检验工作效率提高二十倍。
    在技术鸣放和辩论中，可以取长补短，集中优点，许多过去认为不能解决的问题都迎刃而解。这个厂今年琅粉需要量比去年增加一倍多，琅粉供不应求。领导上提出是否能想办法提高出粉率，有些干部认为不扩建工厂增加设备就不可能增产。工人刘志华认为有可能提高磨粉率。因为他看到每次磨粉粘土洗一次磨子，刚洗过的磨子出粉快，但不知什么道理。辩论中大家找出道理，原来是刚洗过的球磨，石子上没有粉，冲击力大，所以磨的快。第二天就采用这个办法，工效提高了40％，在不增加设备的情况下，满足了全厂二、三季度所需要的琅粉。
    西安人民搪瓷厂职工在大跃进中，要使本厂产量要比去年提高两倍多，质量提高190％，花色增加一千二百种，并试制成功八十六种工业搪瓷新品种。职工热情很高，干劲很大。在跃进中，厂党委发现以往障碍开展技术革新的主要原因是没有很好的贯彻群众路线。过去采用个人填表、画图的办法，处理要经过六、七道手续，最快也要经过一个月的时间。干部都感到工作紧张，提出很多建议没有时间研究。针对这些问题，厂领导上提倡工人自提、自研究、自解决。凡是工人提出来的建议，先由小组研究补充，大家认为可行，又可以利用废旧料进行试验，就由小组研究试验：如果需要花钱购置材料或者小组解决不了的，就把意见提出来交给车间：花钱在一百元以下的，由车间决定：百元以上或有关全厂性的重大问题，由厂领导上决定。这样，约有70％的建议可以由群众自己研究、自己试验、自己解决；20％由车间研究解决，只有10％的重大建议需要由厂一级领导来解决。依靠群众的力量，处理及时，见效快，能够更快的在生产上发挥作用。
    职工们在辩论用鸣放的办法开展技术革新中，批判了有些干部怕搞乱生产；怕用技术鸣放形式，处理不好，影响大家情绪，主张还用过去的老办法。一致认为用鸣放办法能集思广益，集中大家的智慧，使得建议更完整和周到；同时，各种意见提出来共同讨论也会越辩越明。
