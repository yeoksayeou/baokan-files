　　Loquats are in season around the Dragon Boat Festival. Eat loquats quickly after the festival, or they will be gone. Loquats come in golden yellow, light yellow, and orange-red varieties. Among them, the orange-red "Red Seed Loquat" and the light yellow "White Sand Loquat" are the most delicious, with large fruits and thick flesh.

　　Loquats originated in China and began to grow and become popular during the early Han Dynasty. The original production area was in present-day Jiajiang County, Sichuan Province. It is said that when the Han Dynasty emperor wanted to build the magnificent "Shanglin Garden" in the capital, he only found ten loquat trees, which were hailed as famous and exotic fruits, and were quite precious. By the Tang Dynasty, loquats had become valuable tribute items. Emperor Taizong of Tang once replied in a letter: "Upon your arrival, I received the loquat seeds you sent, and I am deeply pleased. The fine fruit is a rare delicacy, uniquely crowning the season's novelties. However, the road from Sichuan is far, so there is no need to send more." Later, loquats were gradually introduced and cultivated in various provinces in the north and south, and are widely distributed in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong, Guizhou, Shaanxi and other provinces. Among them, the loquats produced in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, and Hunan are of the best quality. For example, the loquats produced in the Dongting area of Jiangsu and Tangqi in Zhejiang occupy an important position in the country.

　　The loquat tree is about one or two zhang tall. Its leaves are charming and lovely, never wither throughout the four seasons, and have short yellow hairs on the back. Their shape is broad, like the pipa musical instrument, hence the name "loquat." The flowering period of the loquat is in early winter, from September to October. The small white flowers are in spicate inflorescences, with each inflorescence having sixty to ninety, or even one hundred fifty to two hundred flowers. "Loquat trees are full of flowers in winter" (Tang, Cen Shen) and are highly ornamental. After flowering, it bears round, oblate, or oval, obovate yellow, orange-red, or light yellow fruits, bearing fruit abundantly, like golden bullets, which are the edible part. Ancient people described it as "trees full of jade green leaves, branches stacked with golden pills," and "golden clusters under glassy leaves," which is truly beautiful and moving.

　　In addition to being eaten fresh as fruit, loquat flowers, pulp, and leaves can be used as medicinal materials, and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. Loquat flowers can treat headache and nasal congestion; the fruit also has the effect of quenching thirst and lowering qi, benefiting lung qi and moistening the five internal organs; the leaves, after removing the hairs and decocting, can treat vomiting, thirst, and other symptoms, and some even steam the leaves to extract dew, called "Loquat Leaf Dew," which is an effective medicine for clearing the lungs and relieving coughs. Even the discarded loquat kernels can be used to brew wine in place of grain.

　　The taste of loquat is excellent: sweet, sour, fresh, clean, moist with dew, and juicy. An earlier poem said: "Rain weighs down the branches, juice flows and chills the teeth; like plums but dislike the numerous pits, like honey but with a little sourness." However, the time when loquats are on the market is not long. How can we find a way to store this delicious fruit? You can prepare a jar, fill it with an appropriate amount of clear water, add some mint and alum to the water, and then put the loquats in it. This can be stored for two or three months without spoiling or discoloration, and it will have a cooler taste when eaten.

    夏月枇杷黄似桔
    屯生
    枇杷在端午节时候当令。过了端午，快吃枇杷，否则就要没有了。枇杷有金黄色的，淡黄色的，橙红色的几种。其中橙红色的“红种枇杷”和淡黄色的“白沙枇杷”，果大肉厚，滋味为最鲜甜。
    枇杷原产我国，在汉初开始生长流行，最初的产地是现在的四川省夹江县。据说汉代皇帝要在京城里建造华丽的“上林宛”，仅物色到十株枇杷树，被誉为名果异树，相当珍贵。到唐朝，枇杷成为贵重的进贡品，唐太宗曾有这样一个回帖说：“使至，得所进枇杷子，良深慰悦，嘉果珍味，独冠时新，但川路既遥，无劳更送。”以后，枇杷逐渐引种到南北各省栽培，在湖南、湖北、江西、浙江、江苏、福建、广东、贵州、陕西等省分布很广。其中以浙江、江苏、福建、湖南所出产的最为优良，如江苏洞庭一带和浙江塘栖两处所出产的枇杷，在国内占有重要的地位。
    枇杷的树身高约一、二丈。叶片婆娑可爱，四时不雕，背面有黄色短毛，形状阔大，犹如乐器中的琵琶一样，“枇杷”的名称就是由此而来的。初冬9至10月间是枇杷的开花期，是穗状花序的白色小花，每一花序有花六十至九十朵或一百五十至二百朵之多，“满树枇杷冬著花”，（唐、岑参）很有观赏价值。花后结圆形、扁圆形，或椭圆形、倒卵形等黄色、橙红色、淡黄色的果实，结果累累，仿佛金色弹丸，那就是食用的部分了。古人描写说，“树繁碧玉叶，柯叠黄金丸”，“琉璃叶底黄金簇”真是美丽动人。
    枇杷除作水果生啖以外，它的花、果肉和树叶可以当药材，常为中医处方引用。枇杷花可治头风鼻塞；果实又有止渴下气，利肺气、润五脏的功效；叶片去毛煎服，主治呕哕、口渴等症，并有蒸制其叶取露的，名叫“枇杷叶露”，是清肺、止咳的特效药。甚至被遗弃的枇杷核，还可以代粮食酿酒。
    枇杷的滋味优美：甘、酸、鲜、洁，裛露多汁；前人有诗说：“雨压枝头重，浆流冰齿寒；似梅嫌足核，如蜜少加酸。”但是枇杷应市的时间不长，要怎样设法使这鲜美的佳果贮藏起来呢？可以预备一只瓮，内灌适量的清水，水内渗放些薄荷和明矾，然后把枇杷投入其中，这样能藏二、三个月，既不会变质变色，而且食用时更有凉爽的滋味。
