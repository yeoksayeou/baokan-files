Editor's Note: This editorial in the Worker's Daily explains a very important issue and is worth reading carefully. On this issue, some trade union workers still have some incorrect views, and this editorial will help to correct these incorrect views.

As our people are exerting all their efforts, striving for the top, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, we are celebrating the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party with the brilliant achievements of the great leap forward in all our work. Our Party was established in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist principles of Party building. From the day the Party was founded, it has had a high degree of organization, combat effectiveness, and discipline, and has an inseparable connection with the working class and the broad masses of urban and rural laborers. Therefore, it can develop from the initial groups of propaganda and research on communism into today's great Party leading the 600 million people of the great People's Republic of China in a vigorous socialist construction. As soon as the Chinese Communist Party stepped onto the political stage, it assumed the leadership responsibility for the Chinese people's revolution and pointed out a correct path of struggle for the Chinese people's revolution. The Chinese working class and the laboring people have profoundly experienced that the Chinese Communist Party's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal program is the only correct political line in the period of the Chinese people's democratic revolution. The heroic struggle and selfless dedication of the Communist Party members are the glory of the Chinese nation and the example of the people. The working class and the laboring people of the whole country closely united around our Party, went through more than 20 years of tortuous and arduous struggle, and won the great victory of the people's democratic revolution. The working class became the leading class of the country, and the laboring people of the whole country became the masters of the country and society. The victorious Chinese working class and laboring people, under the leadership of our Party, carried out a series of struggles to eliminate the influence and remnants of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. These struggles included the land reform movement, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements, and the ideological remolding movement. In the second half of 1955 and the first half of 1956, our Party led the people in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, achieved a decisive victory on the economic front, and changed the private ownership of the means of production. In 1957, our Party led the people of the whole country in rectification and the anti-Rightist struggle, carrying out a deeper and wider socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and we achieved another great victory. The scale, speed, and effectiveness of these movements were unprecedented. These movements laid a solid foundation for our country, opened up a broad road for our socialist construction, and brought a happy mood, ideological liberation, and revolutionary drive to all the people. Today, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, the 600 million people of the whole country have been unprecedentedly invigorated. Everyone is striving to be advanced, and everyone is contributing their talents. They are carrying out socialist construction centered on the technological revolution and the cultural revolution with earth-shaking labor enthusiasm and creativity. Our country's industry, agriculture, and scientific and cultural undertakings are developing at a speed unparalleled in world history, and countless amazing miracles are constantly emerging. This is because the policies and guidelines formulated by our Party and Chairman Mao completely conform to the requirements and wishes of the people of the whole country, and the people execute every call and task of the Party with the utmost trust. All this shows that the Chinese Communist Party is glorious, great, and correct. It is the only Party that can lead the Chinese working class and the Chinese people to fight against the enemy and achieve liberation, and it is the only Party that can lead us to build socialism and make the country prosperous and strong. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no New China, and there would be no socialism.

Trade union workers have profoundly realized from their own experience the correctness and necessity of the Party's leadership over trade union work. The trade union organization must operate entirely in accordance with the Party's policies and guidelines under the leadership of the Party's correct line, so that trade union work can do things that are beneficial to the working class and to the socialist cause. Because the Party is the highest organizational form of the working class. The Party's policies and guidelines are the crystallization of Marxism-Leninism and the experience and wisdom of the broadest masses of the people, and they embody the consistency of the long-term interests and current interests and demands of the national laboring people. The trade union organization is a mass organization of the working class, and trade union work is a part of the Party's mass work and an assistant to the Party's work among the working masses. Therefore, the trade union organization must not only rely on the Party's leadership politically and ideologically, but also rely on the Party's leadership organizationally and professionally. All levels of trade union organizations must, under the leadership of the Party committee at the same level, arrange their work based on the Party's policies, guidelines, and the central tasks of the Party, mobilize and organize the entire workforce, resolutely implement the Party's policies and guidelines, and actively complete the Party's central tasks in various periods. Only in this way can the trade union organization better connect with the broad masses of workers and give full play to its active role in the cause of socialist construction. For example, the trade union organization of Macheng County, Hubei Province, under the leadership of the Macheng County Committee of the CPC, arranged its work around the central task of supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production, and thus achieved great success, created advanced experience, and became a model for county and township trade union work. Therefore, only under the leadership of the Party committee at the same level can all levels of trade union organizations lift the banner of trade union work, and trade union work can have a soul and commander, and only then can the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers be fully brought into play to implement the Party's general line of building socialism. On the contrary, if trade union organizations at all levels do not rely on the leadership of the Party committee at the same level, or verbally accept the leadership of the Party committee but actually emphasize the "organizational independence of the trade union," violate the Party's policies and guidelines, and engage in "independent activities of the trade union" away from the Party's central tasks, then it is inevitable that they will deviate from reality and the masses, make major mistakes, and harm the socialist cause.

To implement the Party's policies and complete the Party's central tasks, the trade union organization must carry out tremendous ideological education work among trade union workers and the masses of workers, so that they realize that realizing the Party's policies and tasks is in line with the long-term and current interests of the working class, and wholeheartedly turn the Party's policies and tasks into their own actions. However, it will inevitably encounter obstruction or resistance from a few people. These few people who are in a backward state of consciousness have a relatively strong non-proletarian ideology, and they often put forward unreasonable opinions and demands for narrow economic interests. This is in conflict with the socialist cause. It is absolutely necessary for trade union workers to understand the lives, demands, and opinions of the workers, but the question is what position, point of view, and attitude you take to deal with it. A good trade union worker must stand firmly on the proletarian position, firmly grasp the Party and government's policies and guidelines, make a sober analysis of the opinions and demands of the workers, distinguish between major and minor, all or part, and accept what is correct and realize it according to conditions and possibilities; what is incorrect should be explained; and what is wrong should be criticized. It is necessary to clearly recognize that criticizing the non-proletarian ideas of the workers is indispensable to raising the communist ideological consciousness of the workers and realizing the Party's policies and tasks. It is wrong to mistakenly regard the wrong opinions and unreasonable demands of some backward workers as the correct opinions and reasonable demands of the entire mass of workers, and to run around advocating them, asking the Party and the government to accept them, and even using this to oppose the Party's leadership over the trade union and oppose the government. This is an extremely wrong attitude. It should be known that our Party is the political party of the working class and the only representative of the highest interests of the working class and the people of the whole country. The Party and government's policies and guidelines are all based on the interests of the 600 million people of the whole country and the overall interests of socialist construction. Trade union workers must, under the leadership of the Party, continuously educate the workers in the communist spirit, promote proletarian ideas and eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideas, so that they recognize their sense of responsibility as the leading class of the country, give play to the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, and strive to conquer the great nature of the motherland, build our country into a great socialist country, liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan, and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

Trade union workers at all levels must strive to study the glorious tradition of the Party and Chairman Mao creatively applying Marxist-Leninist theory to solve practical problems and closely linking with the masses. Chairman Mao has taught us thousands of times: "Proceed from reality in everything," come from the masses, go to the masses, concentrate, and persist. We must study Chairman Mao's thought and love for the masses. Every trade union worker must have a loyal and highly responsible work style for the socialist cause, educate the workers in communist ideology under the leadership of the Party, and rely on the workers' degree of consciousness and organization to realize the Party's policies and tasks. At present, the entire workforce is actively involved in the upsurge of socialist construction, the backward are becoming advanced, the advanced are becoming more advanced, and the communist spirit is unprecedentedly high. Every step forward in the building of socialism by the broad masses of workers has improved their communist awareness and revolutionary drive and enthusiasm. We must be good at using the actual actions of the workers in the construction cause to examine the position, point of view, and work style of each trade union worker, affirm achievements, correct shortcomings, overcome and criticize all kinds of non-proletarian ideas, and expose and eliminate class aliens and bourgeois individualistic careerists who have infiltrated into the trade union organization to purify the trade union organization. The vigorous actions of the workers in building socialism have greatly educated our trade union workers. As long as we firmly rely on the leadership of the Party, improve our work style, and maintain and carry forward the work style and methods of the mass line, the trade union organization will be able to better connect with the workers, give full play to its active role in the cause of socialist construction, and do its work better.

### 工会必须完全在党的领导下才能做好工作  工人日报七月一日社论

    工会必须完全在党的领导下才能做好工作
    工人日报七月一日社论
    编者按：工人日报的这篇社论说明了一个很重要的问题，值得认真阅读。在这个问题上，目前有一部分工会工作者还有一些不正确的观点，这篇社论对于纠正这些不正确的观点是有帮助的。
    在我国人民鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的时候，我们以各项工作的大跃进的光辉成就来迎接中国共产党创立三十七周年纪念日。我们党是按照马克思列宁主义的建党原则建立起来的。从党创立之日起，就具有高度的组织性、战斗性和纪律性，和工人阶级以及广大城乡劳动群众有着血肉不可分离的联系，所以它能够从最初一些宣传和研究共产主义的小组，发展成为今天领导伟大的中华人民共和国六亿人民进行轰轰烈烈的社会主义建设的大党。中国共产党一走上政治舞台，就担负起中国人民革命的领导责任，就给中国人民革命指出了一条正确的斗争道路。中国工人阶级和劳动人民深刻地体验到，中国共产党的反帝反封建纲领，是中国人民民主革命时期唯一正确的政治路线。共产党员英勇奋斗、前仆后继的战斗精神，是中华民族的光荣和人民的榜样。全国工人阶级和劳动人民紧密地团结在我们党的周围，经过了二十多年的迂回曲折的艰苦斗争，取得了人民民主革命的大胜利。工人阶级成为国家的领导阶级，全国劳动人民成为国家和社会的主人。胜利了的中国工人阶级和劳动人民，在我们党的领导下，为清除帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的影响和残渣，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，又进行了一系列的斗争，这就是：土地改革运动，镇压反革命运动，抗美援朝运动，三反五反运动和思想改造运动。在1955年下半年和1956年上半年，我们党又领导人民进行对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，在经济战线上取得了决定性胜利，改变了生产资料的私有制。1957年，我们党领导全国人民整风和反右派斗争，在政治战线上和思想战线上进行更深刻更广泛的社会主义革命，我们又取得了伟大胜利。上述这些运动规模之大，进展之速，收效之快，是空前未有的。这些运动给我们国家奠定了稳如磐石般的基础，给我国社会主义建设开辟了一条康庄大道，给全体人民带来了心情舒畅、思想大解放和革命干劲。在今天，在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，全国六亿人民都空前未有地振奋起来了，人人争先进，个个献才能，他们以翻天复地的劳动热情和创造精神，进行着以技术革命和文化革命为中心的社会主义建设，我国的工业、农业和科学文化事业，正以世界历史上无以伦比的速度发展着，无数惊人的奇迹正在不断地涌现着。这是由于我们党和毛主席所制订的方针政策，完全符合全国人民的要求和愿望，人民群众以最高信赖的心情来执行党的每一个号召和任务。所有这些，都说明中国共产党是光荣的、伟大的、正确的，是唯一能够领导中国工人阶级、中国人民向敌人进行斗争获得了解放的党，是唯一能够领导我们建设社会主义，使国家富强的党。没有共产党的领导，就没有新中国，就没有社会主义。
    工会工作者从自己的经验中深刻地认识到：党对于工会工作领导的正确性和必要性。工会组织必须在党的正确路线领导下，完全按照党的方针政策来办事，工会工作才能做出对工人阶级、对社会主义事业有益的事情。因为党是工人阶级的最高组织形式。党的方针政策，是马克思列宁主义与最广大人民群众的经验和智慧的结晶，是体现了全国劳动人民群众长远利益和当前利益及要求的一致性。工会组织是工人阶级的群众组织，工会工作是党的群众工作的一部分，是党在工人群众中进行工作的助手。因此，工会组织不仅是在政治思想上必须紧紧地依靠党的领导，而且在组织上和业务上也必须紧紧地依靠党的领导。各级工会组织必须在同级党委的领导下，以党的方针、政策，党的中心工作任务为依据，安排自己的工作，发动和组织全体职工群众，坚决贯彻执行党的方针政策，积极地完成党在各个时期的中心任务，工会组织才能够更好地联系广大职工群众，发挥它在社会主义建设事业中的积极作用。例如湖北省麻城县工会组织由于在中共麻城县委的领导下，围绕着以支援农业生产大跃进的中心任务来安排自己的工作，因而获得很大的成绩，创造出先进经验，成为县镇工会工作的榜样。所以，各级工会组织唯有在同级党委的领导下，才能够提起工会工作的纲，工会工作才有灵魂和统帅，才能够把广大职工群众的劳动积极性和创造性充分发挥出来，贯彻执行党的建设社会主义总路线。相反的，如果各级工会组织不依靠同级党委的领导，或在口头上接受党委的领导而在实际上强调“工会的组织独立性”，违背党的方针政策，脱离党的中心任务而搞“工会的独立活动”，那就不可避免地要脱离实际，脱离群众，要犯大错误，使社会主义事业受到损害。
    工会组织要贯彻执行党的方针政策，完成党的中心工作任务，必须在工会工作人员中和职工群众中进行巨大的思想教育工作，使他们认识到实现党的方针和任务，乃是符合工人阶级的长远利益和当前利益的，全心全意地把党的方针和任务变成为自己的行动。可是，也不可避免地会遇到少数人的阻挠或抵触，这些属于觉悟不高的落后状态的少数人，他们有比较浓厚的非无产阶级的思想意识，他们往往提出不合理的意见和狭隘经济利益的要求。这是和社会主义事业相抵触的。工会工作者了解职工群众的生活、要求和意见，是完全必要的，问题在于你以怎样的立场、观点和态度来对待它。一个好的工会工作者，必须站稳无产阶级的立场，紧紧地掌握党和政府的方针政策，对工人群众的意见和要求加以清醒的分析，分清主要或次要，全部或小部，正确的应当接受，根据条件与可能使之实现；不对的应当解释说明；错误的应当给予批判。要明确地认识到：对工人群众中的非无产阶级思想进行批判，是提高工人群众的共产主义思想觉悟，实现党的方针和任务所不可少的。不能把部分落后工人的错误意见和不合理要求，错误地认为是全体工人群众的正确意见和合理要求，到处奔走呼号，要党和政府接受，甚至以此来反对党领导工会，反对政府。这是极其错误的态度。要知道：我们党是工人阶级的政党，是工人阶级和全国人民最高利益的唯一代表者。党和政府的方针政策，都是从全国六亿人民利益出发，从社会主义建设的总利益出发。工会工作者必须在党的领导下，不断地以共产主义精神来教育工人群众，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想影响，使他们认识到作为国家领导阶级的责任感，发挥艰苦奋斗的革命精神，为征服祖国的大自然，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，为解放我国的神圣领土台湾，为保卫远东与世界和平而斗争。
    各级工会工作者，必须努力学习党和毛主席创造性运用马克思列宁主义理论来解决实际问题和紧密联系群众的光荣传统。毛主席千百次地教导我们：“一切从实际出发”、从群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去。我们要学习毛主席的思想和热爱群众的作风。每个工会工作者都必须具有为社会主义事业忠贞不移、高度负责的作风，在党的领导下，以共产主义思想来教育工人群众，依靠工人群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，来实现党的方针和任务。目前，全体职工群众都积极投入到社会主义建设高潮中，落后的变先进，先进的更先进，共产主义精神空前高涨。广大职工群众的建设社会主义每前进一步，都提高了职工群众的共产主义觉悟与革命干劲和钻劲。我们要善于根据职工群众在建设事业中的实际行动情况，来检查每个工会工作者的立场、观点和工作作风，肯定成绩，纠正缺点；克服和批判各色各样的非无产阶级的思想；揭露和清除混进工会组织里来的阶级异己分子和资产阶级个人主义野心家，纯洁工会组织。职工群众轰轰烈烈的建设社会主义的行动，大大地教育了我们的工会工作者，只要我们紧紧地依靠党的领导，改进我们的工作作风，保持和发扬群众路线的工作作风和工作方法，工会组织就能够更好地联系职工群众，充分地发挥它在社会主义建设事业中的积极作用，把工作做得更好。
