Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 26th. The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) held an extraordinary meeting on July 26th to discuss the Middle East situation and the actions of working people to defend peace and national independence. Participating in the meeting were members of the Executive Committee from seventeen countries, as well as representatives from brotherly trade union organizations from the United Arab Republic, Iraq, Africa, South America, and other regions. The meeting was opened by Antonín Zápotocký, Chairman of the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions.

    During the discussion on the Middle East issue, Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the WFTU, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that in the past few days, the forces of world peace have definitely been strengthened. However, due to the continued landing of American troops, equipped with atomic weapons, in Lebanon, there remains a very real danger that the situation may deteriorate. Saillant welcomed the resolute initiative shown by the Soviet government in maintaining peace in the Middle East and opposing the threat of war. He said that the Soviet initiative has forced the imperialists to adopt a defensive posture, but it is now more necessary than ever to be vigilant and to take action against the current danger.

    Saillant said that most trade union organizations in various countries now demand the recognition of national independence and the resolution of the Middle East issue through negotiation. He pointed out that this is the basis for developing united action. He suggested that the meeting: First, adopt a letter to the working people and trade unions of the world, calling on them to intensify action by all means before and during the high-level conference; Second, write to the British Trades Union Congress, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the Scandinavian trade unions, and the West German Trade Union Federation, suggesting that they hold meetings as soon as possible and take joint action; Third, write to the governments of the United States and Britain, demanding the unconditional withdrawal of their aggressor troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

    Abdel Hassan, representative of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions, then spoke. He expressed his sincere gratitude to the World Federation of Trade Unions for its support of the national liberation movement in the Middle East countries. He said that the struggle of the Arab nation, supported by the people of all countries, has dealt a heavy blow to the Baghdad Pact. With the support of all progressive people and the powerful World Federation of Trade Unions, we are full of confidence in the future. We thank the working people of the Soviet Union, China, and all other countries for expressing solidarity with our just cause. We will use all our strength to fight the imperialists who cling to their positions.

    Vasily Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, suggested in his speech that the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions propose to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions that they support the initiative for a peaceful settlement of the military conflict caused by US and British imperialism.

    The Indian representative also spoke at the meeting.

    On July 27th, the meeting will continue to discuss how to better mobilize more workers to carry out the struggle for peace. The meeting will adopt a number of proposals.

    世界工联执委会举行非常会议讨论中东局势
    要美英侵略军无条件撤出中东
    据新华社布拉格26日电　世界工会联合会执行委员会26日举行非常会议，讨论中东事件以及劳动人民保卫和平和民族独立的行动的问题。参加会议的有执行委员会的来自十七个国家的委员以及阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克、非洲、南美洲和其他地区的兄弟工会组织的代表。会议由捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会主席苏普卡主持开幕。
    在讨论中东问题时，世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬在会上讲了话。他指出，在过去几天里，世界和平力量肯定有了加强。但是，由于装备着原子武器的美国军队继续在黎巴嫩登陆，目前仍然存在着局势可能会恶化的很现实的危险。赛扬表示欢迎苏联政府在维护中东和平反对战争威胁方面所表现的坚决的主动。他说，苏联的主动迫使帝国主义者采取防守态度，但是目前比任何时候都更需要警惕，需要以行动来反对当前的危险。
    赛扬说，各国大多数的工会组织现在都要求承认民族独立和通过协商的方法解决中东问题。他指出，这就是发展一致行动的基础。他建议会议：一，通过告全世界劳动人民和工会书。呼吁他们在高级会议召开之前和会议进行时间用一切手段加紧行动；二，写信给英国职工大会、美国劳联—产联、斯堪的纳维亚各国工会、西德工会联合会，建议同它们尽快举行会见同时采取共同的行动；三，写信给美英两国政府，要求把它们的侵略军无条件地从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出去。
    阿拉伯工会国际联合会代表阿卜杜勒·哈桑接着发言。他对世界工会联合会给予中东国家民族解放运动的支援表示由衷的感激。他说，受到各国人民支持的阿拉伯民族的斗争给了巴格达条约一个沉重的打击。我们在全体进步人士和强大的世界工会联合会的支持下，对未来是满怀信心的。我们感谢苏联、中国和所有其他国家的劳动人民，因为他们表示声援我们的正义事业。我们将用我们的全部力量同坚持他们的阵地的帝国主义者进行斗争。
    全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申在发言时建议：由世界工会联合会执委会向国际自由工会联合会和基督教工会国际联合会提出建议，建议它们支持关于和平解决由美、英帝国主义引起的军事冲突的倡议。
    在会上发言的还有印度代表。
    7月27日，会议将继续讨论怎样更好地动员更多的工人来进行争取和平的斗争的问题。会议将通过一些提案。
