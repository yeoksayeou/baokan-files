US-British Aggressors Collaborate to Find Their Graves

As the United States brazenly launches armed intervention in Lebanon, triggering universal condemnation from people worldwide, Britain is following in the footsteps of the United States by sending troops to Jordan. The US and Britain are conspiring to take joint aggressive action in the Middle East, thinking that this will extinguish the sacred flame of the great Arab people and all the people of Asia and Africa in their struggle for freedom and independence. They are merely dreaming. However, since they have launched this mad provocation against the Arab people, the Asian and African people, and all peace-loving countries in the world, they cannot but bear all the moral responsibility and all the serious consequences arising therefrom.

Britain's excuse for sending troops to Jordan is exactly the same as that of the United States. The aggressors are being "invited," so it seems they don't count as aggressors. But Britain is even more cowardly than the United States. Even after British troops had begun entering Jordan, British official spokesmen were still trying to cover up, saying that the news of British troops landing in Jordan was "completely untrue." This was not the case during the Suez Canal crisis. It shows how dirty Britain's adventurous aggressive actions are, how they can't be seen by anyone at home or abroad!

Britain and the United States have made such a division of labor: the United States intervenes in Lebanon, and Britain intervenes in Jordan. This is simply because Britain established colonial rule in Jordan under the name of "mandate" as early as after the First World War, so they are old acquaintances. However, Britain does not benefit from this. British imperialism is not only the age-old enemy of the Jordanian people, but also the defeated opponent of the Jordanian people. In 1946, under the strong pressure of the national independence movement in the Middle East, Britain was forced to recognize Jordan's "independence," supported the grandfather of the current King Hussein as a puppet king, and continued to control Jordan's actual power through the British General Glubb, who controlled the "Arab Legion." However, the eyes of the Jordanian people are sharp, and they know that they have not achieved independence. They have risen up many times to carry out vigorous struggles, and finally expelled Glubb in the spring of 1956, and established a national independent government. Last April, the United States and Britain created a coup d'état, subverted the national independent government, and Jordan once again fell into the colonial shackles of US and British imperialism. But since then, the Jordanian people have never yielded, and have never stopped their heroic struggle. After the establishment of the United Arab Republic, especially after the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, the Jordanian people have more clearly seen their only way out. Now that the old enemy is here again, this can only add fuel to the fire of the struggle of the Jordanian people and the entire Arab East. The Arab people and all Asian and African people who demand freedom can immediately see what the United States government and the British government are all about. All the hypocrisy of the Western imperialists is gone, and the true colors of colonialism are revealed. The old masters of Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt, who were extremely vicious, the British who were driven away by the Jordanian and Egyptian people, and who used planes and artillery to slaughter Egyptian women and children in October 1956, are back again; and the Americans, who pretended to oppose the British and French aggression during the Suez Canal crisis, are now standing with the British, and are coming faster than the British, and opening fire faster than the British! The history of the British provides annotations for the Americans, and the actions of the Americans provide annotations for the British. This can greatly accelerate the awakening of the Asian and African people and the people of the world, sweep away all the deceptions of the US and British governments, and discredit them in the eyes of the people of the world. This is the inevitable political result of the joint aggression of the US and Britain in the Middle East.

The British aggressors are not only isolated among the people of the Middle East, but also isolated among the people of their own country. The bourgeois Manchester Guardian had already predicted on the 15th that British intervention in Jordan would be "disastrous." On the same day, Labor MP Crossman also asserted: "This gamble by Britain and the United States in Jordan will prove to be as much of a failure as the gamble by Britain and France in Suez." Although Labor leader Gaitskell is undoubtedly a supporter of British imperialist interests, he cannot but warn: "If we try to force the countries of the Middle East to accept our will by force, and re-establish a government system that was possible and even reasonable in the nineteenth century, but which seems inappropriate and very dangerous to us in the modern situation, then I can only say—God help us all." This pessimistic expectation for the outcome of US-British intervention pervades the entire capitalist world. The people of the world unanimously condemn the piratical behavior of the two governments.

A European proverb says: Whom God wishes to destroy, he first makes mad. The cooperation of the US and British aggressors is nothing but this mad cooperation before death, this cooperation to find their graves. The heroic people of the Middle East and all the Asian and African people striving for freedom are preparing a large grave for the Western aggressors. Since the aggressors insist on entering this grave, then let us unite and send them to the grave!

### 美英侵略者为寻找坟墓而合作

    美英侵略者为寻找坟墓而合作
    在美国悍然发动对黎巴嫩的武装干涉、引起全世界人民普遍谴责的时候，英国又步美国后尘，出兵约旦。美英两国密谋在中东采取联合侵略行动，以为这样就可以扑灭伟大的阿拉伯人民以及全亚非人民争取自由独立的神圣火焰。他们不过是在作梦罢了。但是，他们既然向阿拉伯人民、亚非人民和全世界爱好和平的各国人民进行这种疯狂的挑衅，他们就不能不承担由此而来的一切道义的责任和一切严重的后果。
    英国出兵约旦的借口同美国一模一样。侵略者是被“邀请”来的，因此似乎就可以不算是侵略了。但是英国比美国还要心虚。甚至在英国军队已经开始进入约旦以后，英国官方发言人还要遮掩，说什么英国部队正在约旦着陆的消息是“完全不真实的”。在苏伊士运河事件中还没有出现过这种情况。可见英国的冒险的侵略的行动是多么肮脏，无论在国内或国外多么见不得人！
    英国和美国作了这样的分工：美国干涉黎巴嫩，英国干涉约旦。这无非是因为英国早在第一次世界大战以后，就在所谓“委任统治地”的名义下，在约旦建立了殖民统治，算是老相识了。但是，英国并不因此占什么便宜。英帝国主义不但是约旦人民的世仇，而且是约旦人民手下的败将。1946年，在中东民族独立运动的强大压力下，英国被迫承认约旦“独立”，扶植了现任国王侯赛因的祖父担任傀儡国王，并且通过控制着“阿拉伯军团”的英国将军格拉布继续掌握约旦的实权。但是约旦人民的眼睛是雪亮的，他们知道他们并没有取得独立。他们曾经多次奋起进行轰轰烈烈的斗争，在1956年春终于驱逐了格拉布，建立了民族独立政府。去年4月，美英两国制造了政变，颠复了民族独立政府，约旦又重新陷入美英帝国主义殖民枷锁。但是从那时以来，约旦人民始终没有屈服，始终没有停止过英勇的斗争。在阿拉伯联合共和国成立以后，特别是在伊拉克共和国成立以后，约旦人民更加看清了自己的唯一出路。现在，老仇人又来了，这对于约旦人民和整个阿拉伯东方人民的斗争只能起火上加油的作用。阿拉伯人民和一切要求自由的亚非人民马上可以看出：美国政府和英国政府究竟是一些什么东西。西方帝国主义者的一切假仁假义都不要了，殖民主义的本来面目都拿出来了。原先的约旦、伊拉克、埃及的穷凶极恶的旧主人，被约旦人民和埃及人民赶跑了的、1956年10月还用飞机大炮屠杀埃及妇女儿童的英国人又来了；而在苏伊士运河事件时期装模作样反对英法侵略的美国人呢，现在是跟英国人站在一起，而且来得比英国人还快，开火也比英国人还快！英国人的历史替美国人做注解，美国人的行动替英国人做注解，这就可以大大加速亚非人民和全世界人民的觉悟，把美英政府的种种欺骗一扫而光，使它们在全世界人民面前威信扫地：这就是美英在中东共同侵略的必然的政治结果。
    英国侵略者不但在中东人民中是孤立的，在本国人民中也是孤立的。资产阶级的曼彻斯特卫报在15日就已经预言英国在约旦的干涉将“具有灾难性质”。同一天，工党议员克罗斯曼也断定：“英国和美国在约旦的这场赌博，将证明会像英国和法国在苏伊士的赌博同样输得很惨。”英国工党领袖盖茨克尔虽然无疑是英帝国主义利益的支持者，他也不能不提出警告：“如果我们试图用武力强迫中东国家接受我们的意志，重新建立一种在十九世纪是可能的甚至是合理的，而在现代情况下在我们看来是不适当的和非常危险的政府制度，那末我只能说——上帝保佑我们大家吧。”对于美英干涉结局的这种悲观的预料，笼罩着整个资本主义世界。全世界的人民一致谴责这两国政府的海盗行为。
    欧洲人的俗语说：上帝要谁死亡，必先使他疯狂。美英侵略者的合作，不是什么别的东西，就是这种死亡以前的疯狂的合作，就是这种寻找坟墓的合作。英勇的中东人民和全体争取自由的亚非人民，正在为西方侵略者准备一个大坟墓。侵略者既然坚持非要进这个坟墓不可，那么就让我们团结一致，把他们送进坟墓去！
