    High-Yield Fodder – Chayote
    Chayote, also known as fruit gourd, is a very good succulent fodder for pig raising.
    Chayote has a very high yield. It bears fruit the summer after planting and can be harvested for several years. In the first year of fruiting, each plant yields two to three hundred catties, three to four hundred catties in the second year, and more than two hundred catties in the third year.
    Chayote is not only high in yield but also very nutritious. The flesh of the fruit is tender, and the taste is sweet and refreshing, better than winter melon and pumpkin.

    高产饲料——佛手瓜
    佛手瓜，又名果瓜。是一种养猪很好的多汁饲料。
    佛手瓜产量很高，当年种植次年夏天即结瓜，并可继续收获数年之久。结瓜的第一年，每株收二、三百斤，第二年收三、四百斤，第三年二百多斤。
    佛手瓜不但产量高，营养亦很丰富。瓜果肉质细嫩，味道清甜，比东瓜、南瓜好。    （张庆胜）
