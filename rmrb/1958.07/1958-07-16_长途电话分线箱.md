    Long-Distance Telephone Distribution Box
    This spring, the Wuhan Telecommunications Engineering Company of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications sent a design sketch to the Wuhan Thirteenth Five-Year Metal Production Cooperative, requesting them to manufacture a batch of long-distance telephone distribution boxes.
    The long-distance telephone distribution box is a device for maintaining long-distance telephone lines. It is equipped with components such as fuses and vacuum lightning arresters. By placing them on telephone poles, line failures can be prevented even in thunderstorms. In the past, this precision telecommunications equipment was imported from Japan.
    The members of the Thirteenth Five-Year Metal Cooperative boldly accepted this task and entrusted it to members Chen Yanyun and Wang Shoufang. Relying on the collective's ideas, they overcame various difficulties and converted an old treadle machine in the cooperative into a gun bed for manufacturing parts; when raw materials were insufficient, they used substitutes. Within two months, they produced while exploring experience, and finally successfully trial-produced the first long-distance telephone distribution box. Afterwards, they continuously made twenty-three more, reducing the production time for each to four working days.

    长途电话分线箱
    今年春天，邮电部武汉电讯工程公司给武汉市十三五金生产社送来了一张设计草图，要求他们制造一批长途电话分线箱。
    长途电话分线箱是一种维护长途电话线路的设备，上面装有保险丝、真空避雷器等构件，把它们安置在电线杆上，即使在雷雨交加的天气里，也可以保证线路不发生故障。这种精密电讯器材过去是从日本进口的。
    十三五金社社员大胆接受了这个任务，并且把它交给了社员陈炎运和王守芳。他们两人依靠集体出主意，克服种种困难，把社里的一部旧踩机改装成铳床，用来制造零件；原材料不足，就使用代用品。在两个月时间内，他们边生产，边摸索经验，终于试制成功第一个长途电话分线箱。以后，他们又连续做了二十三个，每个生产时间缩短到四个劳动日。
