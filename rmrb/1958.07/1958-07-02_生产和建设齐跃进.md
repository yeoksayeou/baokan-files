Simultaneous Great Leap Forward in Production and Construction
	Kong Sang
	Half of this year has already passed. In the past six months, China's industrial production and industrial construction have developed at a historically unprecedented high speed. However, just as the news published in today's newspaper about Jilin Province striving to comprehensively complete its industrial Great Leap Forward plan reflects, amidst the resounding songs of victory everywhere, some shortcomings are inevitable. These include some enterprises relaxing their leadership over production, some enterprises shrinking back when encountering difficulties, and some enterprises becoming complacent due to victory. These are all negative factors hindering our continued Great Leap Forward. We must, like Jilin Province, quickly correct this phenomenon so that we can achieve even more outstanding results in the second half of the year than in the first half.
	Both production and construction are for the purpose of developing the productive forces. The production of existing enterprises and the construction of new enterprises are two interrelated and mutually promoting fronts in our industrial Great Leap Forward. The faster the speed of capital construction, the more new factories and mines are completed, the faster we can expand reproduction. The better the production tasks of existing enterprises are completed, the more equipment they can produce for capital construction and the more funds they can accumulate. Therefore, in departments and enterprises that have both capital construction tasks and production tasks, it is certainly wrong to only focus on production and relax leadership over construction, and it is also wrong to only focus on construction and relax leadership over production. We should grasp both construction and production, so that construction and production can promote each other and advance together in a Great Leap Forward.
	We are in an era of high-speed development, in an era where "one day equals twenty years," and difficulties are inevitable. For example, some newly built factories and mines lack modern equipment, and some existing enterprises lack sufficient raw material supplies, so their equipment capacity cannot be fully utilized, and so on. It can be said that these difficulties are expected. The key is what attitude to take towards difficulties. There are two attitudes: one is a positive attitude. For example, Jilin Province's machinery industry lacks steel, so they actively developed the steel industry to increase steel production; the food industry lacks raw materials, so they changed from single management to diversified management. In this way, they transformed difficult conditions into favorable conditions. They not only overcame difficulties in the Great Leap Forward and guaranteed this year's Great Leap Forward, but also paved the way for an even greater Great Leap Forward next year. The other is a negative attitude, wanting to revise the plan and go backward when encountering difficulties. Difficulties cannot be avoided. Avoiding them this year will create even greater difficulties for production and construction next year. Therefore, to achieve a Great Leap Forward, we should take a positive attitude towards difficulties and use the method of developing production to overcome difficulties, rather than using the method of shrinking production to avoid difficulties.
	Under the radiance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the broad masses of workers and staff are in high spirits, daring to act and daring to do. As long as we adhere to continuous revolution, do not become complacent when we achieve victory, do not shrink back when we encounter difficulties, and conscientiously rely on the masses, we will definitely be able to achieve a simultaneous Great Leap Forward in production and construction.

    生产和建设齐跃进
    孔桑
    今年已经过去了一半。在过去的半年里，我国工业生产和工业建设，以历史上罕有的高速度发展着。但是，正像今天本报发表的吉林省力争全面完成工业跃进计划的消息中所反映的情况那样，在到处奏着凯歌的声中，也难免有一些缺点，这就是有的企业放松对生产的领导，有的企业碰到了困难畏缩不前，有的企业则因为胜利而自满起来。这些都是妨碍我们继续跃进的消极因素。我们要像吉林省那样，赶快纠正这种现象，以便下半年比上半年做出更出色的成绩。
    生产和建设都是为了发展生产力。现有企业的生产和新企业的建设，是我们工业大跃进的两条互相联系着互相促进着的战线。基本建设的速度越快，建成的新厂矿越多，就越能以更快的速度扩大再生产。现有企业的生产任务完成得越好，就越能为基本建设生产更多的设备，积累更多的资金。因此，在又有基本建设任务、又有生产任务的部门和企业，只抓生产而放松对建设的领导固然不对，只抓建设而放松对生产的领导也不对。我们应该一手抓建设，一手抓生产，使建设和生产互相促进，齐头跃进。
    我们正处在高速度发展的时代，处在“一天等于二十年”的时代，困难是一定有的。例如，有些新建厂矿没有现代设备，有些现有企业的原材料的供应不足，设备能力不能充分发挥等等。可以说，这些困难都是意料中的，关键是对困难采取什么态度。有两种态度：一种是积极的态度。例如吉林省的机械工业缺乏钢材，他们就积极发展钢铁工业，增加钢材的生产；食品工业原料不足，他们就变单一经营为多种经营。这样，化困难条件为有利条件，他们不仅在跃进中战胜困难，保证今年的跃进，还为明年更大的跃进开辟了道路。另一种是消极的态度，遇到困难就想修改计划，往回走。困难是躲避不了的，躲得过今年，就会给明年的生产和建设造成更大的困难。因此，要跃进，就应该对困难采取积极的态度，用发展生产的办法来战胜困难，而不应该用收缩生产的办法来躲避困难。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光芒照耀下，广大职工群众精神奋发，敢作敢为。只要我们坚持不断革命，得到胜利不自满，遇到困难不退缩，认真依靠群众，就一定能做到生产和建设齐跃进。
