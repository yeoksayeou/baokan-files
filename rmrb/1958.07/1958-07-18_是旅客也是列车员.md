　　Is a Passenger and Train Conductor

　　On June 6th, after the No. 11 express train from Beijing to the Northeast passed Tianjin, several PLA officers suddenly came to our carriage to clean it. They cleaned very thoroughly. In the evening, some young students came again to clean the carriage and assist the train conductors in taking care of the passengers.

　　Hearing the train conductor's introduction, I learned that these young people were students from the Wuhan Surveying and Mapping Institute, and the officers were comrades from the PLA Unit 103. They were all long-distance passengers on this train. On the train, many other passengers also asked to participate in the work on the train, but the train conductors politely declined in order to take care of their rest.

　　Being both a passenger and a train conductor may seem like a small matter, but it vividly reflects the new social custom of everyone loving labor and the spirit of mutual assistance and love in our socialist society.

    是旅客也是列车员
    6月6日，从北京开往东北去的十一次快车，过了天津后，突然有几位解放军军官同志来到我们车厢内清扫车内卫生。他们清扫的非常彻底，傍晚，又来了一些青年学生打扫车厢，并协助列车员照顾旅客。
    听到列车员的介绍，才知道这些青年是武汉测量制图学院的学员，军官是解放军一○三部队的同志。他们都是这次列车里的长途旅客。在车上，还有很多旅客要求参加车上劳动，列车员为了照顾他们的休息，就婉言谢绝了。
    是旅客、也是列车员，看来是件小事，但是却鲜明地反映出我们社会主义社会里人人爱劳动的新风尚和互助友爱的精神。
