    "Home Hospital Beds" are a Creation of Medical and Health Work
    Doctors and Patients are as Close as Family
    The Ministry of Health Convenes an On-Site Meeting in Tianjin to Summarize Good Experiences in Hospital Work Reform
    (Reported by our correspondent Zhu Zemin) The Ministry of Health convened a national on-site meeting in Tianjin on hospital work reform and "home hospital beds," focusing on studying how to implement the general line in medical and health work under the situation of a high tide in industrial and agricultural production. The meeting determined that all reforms should continue in hospitals nationwide, planting red flags everywhere, so that health work can achieve a greater leap forward on the existing foundation.
    The meeting was held from June 24th to 28th, with the participation of负责人 from provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, twenty-four cities under provincial jurisdiction, and one hundred and ten hospitals.
    The meeting summarized the various experiences in the great leap forward of hospital work over the past six months. Representatives from various regions expressed great interest in the experience introduced by Tianjin hospitals in implementing "home hospital beds," and unanimously agreed that this is another creation in medical and health work, a new form of embodying the combination of prevention and treatment. From the beginning of April to now, more than eighty grassroots outpatient departments and joint clinics in Tianjin have set up more than one thousand "home hospital beds" without spending a penny of state funds. This kind of "home hospital bed" has many advantages. Bringing medicine to the door greatly improves the relationship between hospitals and the masses. Medical personnel go deep into patients' homes, changing the past situation of "only understanding the condition, not understanding human feelings," and not understanding the lives and thoughts of the masses, which has a great effect on the ideological transformation of medical personnel. From Tianjin's experience, promoting "home hospital beds" must be based on the implementation of zoned medical treatment, mobilizing all grassroots medical and health departments to be responsible by area, so as to reduce the walking time of medical personnel and not increase their burden too much. In addition, the target patients for "home hospital beds" should also be based on specific conditions, generally targeting chronic diseases, acute diseases with specific therapies, diseases in the recovery period, and certain infectious diseases.
    The meeting focused on summarizing the experience of "home hospital beds," and at the same time affirmed other important experiences in hospital work reform. The meeting held that improving the service attitude of medical personnel is the primary link in improving the quality of medical care. At present, with the implementation of the three-shift outpatient system and simple hospital beds in hospitals, the improvement of service attitude has expanded to all aspects of the hospital. Many hospitals in Tianjin have proposed to provide hospitalized patients with three warmths: warmth upon admission, during hospitalization, and upon discharge. Patients are greeted by doctors upon admission; patients listen to the radio during surgery to reduce pain; there are recreational activities, work-rest get-togethers, current affairs learning, and health education in the wards; medical staff send patients to the door when they are discharged, and are responsible for sending patients home if their relatives are not present. Many hospitals in Beijing have also seen new trends such as registering and picking up medicine for patients. The medical staff of the Sixth Hospital in Beijing also vacated their offices to establish a "Patient's Home," held a "Children's Paradise" for child patients, and the pediatrics department tutored and told stories to children with mild illnesses.
    The situations introduced by many provinces and cities at the meeting all proved that breaking unreasonable rules and regulations is an important link in promoting medical work. Hospitals in various places have not only reformed unreasonable systems in registration, medicine dispensing, fee collection, hospitalization, discharge, diet, and treatment, but also many places have opened the doors of hospitals, and medical personnel have gone deep into factories, rural areas, and to provide medical treatment and medicine. About five hundred medical personnel in Tianjin regularly go to factories, rural areas, and street blocks to carry out medical prevention work. In addition, after breaking some unreasonable rules and regulations that hinder running hospitals diligently and thriftily, the fee standards were reduced and the burden on patients was reduced without increasing state expenditures. The Second Hospital of Ningbo City implemented methods such as shortening the length of stay and rationally using expensive drugs without affecting the medical effect. The average cost of medicine for a patient with cholecystitis and gallstones can be reduced by more than 51%, and the cost of medicine for a tonsil surgery patient can be reduced by 49%. Due to the reduction of outpatient costs in various hospitals in Tianjin, patients in the city can reduce the burden of 1.2 million yuan in one year.
    The meeting emphasized that to implement the above-mentioned reforms in the medical system, the key to the decision lies in strengthening the leadership of the Party, putting politics in command, emancipating the mind, and conducting ideological transformation of medical personnel. The meeting criticized the six major superstitions that hinder the development of health work. First, superstition of foreign countries; second, superstition of experts, ignoring the masses, suppressing new forces; third, superstition of technology, ignoring politics, mystifying science and technology; fourth, superstition of rules and regulations, not daring to break them; fifth, superstition of official documents, bureaucracy; sixth, superstition of formality, formalism. Hospitals do not proceed from actual conditions, blindly pursue standardization, only see large-scale, state-run health undertakings, and ignore medium-sized, grassroots, mass-run health undertakings. The meeting also pointed out that in the past two years, there has been great progress in the cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine, and the work of Chinese medicine entering hospitals, but from the overall situation, it is still not done enough. In the future, we must vigorously implement the Chinese medicine policy. Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of Health, made a summary speech at the meeting.

    “家庭病床”是医疗卫生工作的一项创举
    医生和病人亲如一家人
    卫生部在天津召开现场会议总结医院工作改革中的好经验
    本报讯　记者朱泽民报道：卫生部在天津召开全国医院工作改革和“家庭病床”现场会议，着重研究了在工农业生产高潮的形势下医疗卫生工作如何贯彻总路线的问题。会议确定在全国医院中继续进行各项改革，遍插红旗，使卫生工作在现有基础上实现更大的跃进。
    这次会议是6月24日到28日举行的，参加会议的有全国各省、自治区、直辖市和二十四个省辖市、一百一十所医院的负责人。
    会议总结了半年来医院工作大跃进中的各项经验。各地代表对天津市医院实行“家庭病床”的经验介绍感到极大兴趣，一致认为这是医疗卫生工作中的又一项创举，是体现预防和治疗相结合的一种新形式。从4月初到现在，天津市已经有八十多个基层门诊部和联合诊所不花国家一文钱开设了一千多张“家庭病床”。这种“家庭病床”有很多好处。把医药送上门，大大改善了医院和群众的关系，医务人员深入病人家庭，改变了过去“只懂病情，不懂人情”，不了解群众生活和思想感情的状况，这对医务人员的思想改造有很大作用。从天津市的经验来看，推广“家庭病床”必须是在实行划区医疗的基础上，发动所有基层医疗卫生部门按地段负责，这样可以减少医务人员走路时间，不会过多地增加他们的负担。另外，“家庭病床”收容病人的对象也要根据具体条件，一般以慢性病、有特效疗法的急性病、恢复期的疾病和某些传染病作为对象。
    会议围绕着总结“家庭病床”经验，同时肯定了医院工作改革中的其他重要经验。会议认为，医务人员服务态度的改进是提高医疗质量的首要一环。目前，随着医院实行三班门诊制、简易病床以后，改进服务态度已经扩大到医院的各个方面。天津市许多医院提出使住院病人有三温暖：入院、住院、出院温暖。病人入院有大夫迎接；手术进行中给病人听收音机，减轻痛苦；病房里有文娱活动、工休联欢会、时事学习和卫生教育；病人出院时医护人员送到门口，亲属不在的病人还要负责送到家。北京很多医院也出现了代病人挂号取药等新风尚。北京市第六医院的医务人员还把办公室腾出来成立“病友之家”，为儿童病人举办“儿童乐园”，小儿科为轻病儿童补习功课，讲故事。
    许多省市在会上介绍的情况都证明，打破不合理的规章制度是推动医疗工作前进的重要环节。各地医院不但在挂号、取药、收费、住院、出院、饮食、治疗等方面改革了不合理制度，而且许多地方已经做到打开医院大门，医务人员深入到工农中去，送医送药上门。天津市约有五百名医护人员经常下厂、下乡、下地段街道进行医疗预防工作。另外，在打破了一些妨碍勤俭办医院的不合理的规章制度以后，在不增加国家开支的原则下，降低了收费标准，减轻了病人负担。宁波市第二医院在不影响医疗效果的情况下实行了缩短住院天数、合理使用贵重药品等办法，平均一个胆囊炎胆石症的病人医药费可降低51％多，扁桃体手术病人医药费可降低49％。天津市各医院由于降低门诊费用，全市病人在一年内就可以减少一百二十万元的负担。
    会议强调指出，要实行上述医疗制度上的改革，决定的关键在于加强党的领导，政治挂帅，解放思想，对医务人员进行思想改造。会议批判了阻碍卫生工作发展的六大迷信。第一、迷信外国；第二、迷信专家，忽视群众，压抑新生力量；第三、迷信技术，忽视政治，把科学技术神秘化起来；第四，迷信规章制度，也不敢打破；第五，迷信公文，文牍主义；第六，迷信正规，形式主义。医院不从实际情况出发，盲目追求正规化，只看到大型的、国家举办的卫生事业，忽视中等的、基层的、群众自办的卫生事业。会议还指出，两年来中西医合作，中医进医院工作有了很大进展，但从总的情况来看还作的很不够，今后必须大力贯彻中医政策，卫生部副部长徐运北在会上作了总结发言。
