Khrushchev's Letter to Eisenhower

To His Excellency President Dwight D. Eisenhower of the United States of America:

Mr. President:

I have received your reply of July 25 to my letter of July 23 concerning the convening of a summit conference.

I regret to have to point out that the United States government, in this reply, has departed from the position it took on July 22 regarding the prompt convening of a special meeting of the Security Council with the participation of heads of government to discuss the situation in the Middle East.

It is now clear that the United States government is delaying the convening of a summit conference and is unwilling to take urgent measures to peacefully resolve the military conflict occurring in the Middle East.

It must be pointed out that your expression in your letter of July 22 of agreeing to convene a summit conference within the framework of the Security Council was welcomed by various countries. The agreement between the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, France, and India regarding a meeting of heads of government provided some comfort, and the people of all countries have every reason to expect this meeting to be convened soon and to ensure the safeguarding and consolidation of peace in the Middle East. The Soviet government stated that it agreed with Mr. Macmillan's proposal because, when the British Prime Minister suggested holding a summit conference within the framework of the Security Council, he made it clear that no resolutions should be put forward during the conference without prior agreement, and he also made it clear that the purpose of our joint work was to reach a fruitful agreement, not to determine differences through voting.

Your current reply is a step back from the agreement reached, and therefore naturally cannot but arouse serious concern among the people of all countries. The United States government suggests that instead of the heads of government of the five countries discussing the Middle East situation, which endangers the cause of peace, the issue should be resubmitted to an ordinary meeting of the United Nations Security Council. British Prime Minister Macmillan now also supports this suggestion. But what would be the result of this? You are well aware that the Security Council has spent a long time discussing the situation in Lebanon and Jordan, but so far without result.

Now, the issue of stopping the armed aggression against the Middle East is extremely acute, and judging from the experience of recent meetings of the Security Council, it is powerless to make a rapid and effective decision on this issue at its regular sessions.

In this region, armed forces are constantly gathering, and the region is increasingly becoming a powder keg ready to explode and potentially causing a world disaster. In this situation, a summit conference of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, France, and India, attended by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, must be convened immediately, because they possess the high authority to reach an agreement on the immediate cessation of military conflicts in the Middle East and on taking measures to safeguard and consolidate world peace.

It is quite obvious that if we sincerely hope to find a way to ease the tensions, then we should agree that, under such circumstances, these five countries should first agree on the necessary measures to safeguard and consolidate peace. If these five countries reach an agreement on the immediate cessation of armed conflicts in the Middle East, would anyone doubt that any other country that is truly concerned about consolidating peace would welcome and support such a decision?

Mr. Macmillan's proposal on July 22 to hold a summit conference within the framework of the Security Council also stipulated this nature of the summit conference. However, as I have already pointed out, you, Mr. President, and the British Prime Minister are now retreating from this proposal. It cannot be overlooked that the approach taken is to bury the agreement already reached on the prompt convening of a summit conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, France, and India.

We cannot accept this.

The Soviet government insists on its position of struggling to safeguard and consolidate peace, and insists on the position of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and economic systems. The Soviet government has always unwaveringly advocated resolving conflicts peacefully through negotiations. Therefore, we now also firmly advocate the immediate cessation of aggression, and firmly advocate the swift withdrawal of interventionist troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

We are convinced that a summit conference of the five countries, given the sincerity of all parties, would help find ways and possibilities to eliminate military conflicts in the Middle East and stabilize the situation in the Middle East.

In this regard, the Soviet government expresses satisfaction with the views expressed by French Head of Government Mr. de Gaulle in his letter of July 26, in which he expressed his support for the proposal to immediately convene a summit conference of the five countries, attended by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We believe that this view does not differ from the Soviet government's proposal on this issue. We believe that, as previously stated, this is the most correct way to ensure the most rapid solution to the urgent task of stopping military conflicts in the Middle East.

In order to further delay the convening of a summit conference, your letter uses the excuse that the wording of the United States government's proposal for a summit conference has not been understood. Then, one cannot help but ask: was this wording deliberately made so that it could be interpreted in various ways, and that letters had to be exchanged to accurately explain its meaning, wasting time? Since your letter of July 22 expressed agreement to participate in a special meeting of the Security Council with the participation of heads of government, then, in this case, we cannot but understand this as your agreement to convene this meeting as quickly as possible. Now you are evading the prompt convening of this meeting, and suggesting rereading your letter of July 22. What other interpretation can be given to your words other than that the United States government is clearly unwilling to take the most rapid measures to stop the armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan?

Mr. President, I say frankly that the approach taken by the United States and British governments, which is essentially a rejection of a summit conference, cannot but cause unease among the people of all countries, because the people of all countries are anxiously expecting that it will be possible to end the armed conflicts in the Middle East and take measures to safeguard and consolidate universal peace.

Public opinion in various countries is raising a question with anxiety: are the governments of the countries responsible for the current tense situation in the Middle East trying to lull the vigilance of the people and secretly plotting new acts of aggression?

It should be known that the United States government knows better than anyone else that United States troops continue to land in Lebanon, where, with the support and cover of United States bayonets, State Department envoy Murphy is carrying out suspicious activities, and he is rudely interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs. The United States Navy is gathering in the eastern Mediterranean, and United States reinforcements are being airlifted from Europe to the Middle East, especially the Adana region of Turkey. In this regard, it is also particularly noteworthy that in Turkey itself, there are also broad preparations for armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries in the East. King Hussein of Jordan, who has lost the support of his own people and relies on the support of interventionists, dares to use force to threaten to march on Baghdad. He is a docile tool in the hands of well-known Western countries who are plotting conspiracies against the people of the Arab East. Now it can be seen that there is a clear tendency to expand the area of aggression. The threat of military offensive hangs over the Republic of Iraq.

It can be seen from this that delaying negotiations for a summit conference of the five countries, and at the same time increasingly gathering armed forces in the Middle East, will lead to a further sharpening of the situation, leading to the expansion of the conflict, and possibly causing a catastrophe for mankind.

Now, more than ever, it is necessary to take swift and vigorous action to ensure the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and to prevent the expansion of armed conflicts in the Middle East. Time is of the essence.

However, it must be pointed out that the United States government has not only failed to promote the prompt convening of a summit conference in order to immediately stop armed conflicts in the Middle East, but has instead sent its Secretary of State to London to attend a meeting of the member states of the Baghdad Pact. Someone is in a hurry to patch up this treaty, and the fact that the only Arab country in this treaty—Iraq—has withdrawn from this treaty once again shows that the "position of strength" policy and the policy of piecing together aggressive blocs pursued by Western countries have failed. At the same time, the United States government is trying in every possible way to hinder the solution of the main problem that all mankind expects to be solved—the problem of stopping the armed intervention of the United States and Britain in the Middle East. The United States government is trying to lead the negotiations on the summit conference into the endless maze of discussions on the form and procedure of the conference.

The London Conference of representatives of the governments of Great Britain, the United states, Turkey, Pakistan and Iran is being held under the following circumstances: at a time when foreign troops have not only not been withdrawn from Lebanon and Jordan, but are also preparing at full speed for armed intervention in the affairs of the Republic of Iraq, therefore this conference is a conspiracy against the Arab countries. Are not all these practices aimed at plotting new acts of aggression, and using the method of implementing a fait accompli policy to bring the world face to face with an increasingly expanding military conflict?

Can one not consider the serious consequences that this policy will have for its planners in the first place? Because in our era the people are fully alert and will not tolerate acts of aggression.

The United States government is doing its utmost to undermine the summit meeting of the five countries, which is intended to end the armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan and take urgent measures to safeguard and consolidate world peace.

Therefore, the path you are taking is not to resolve the military conflict that has already begun in the Middle East in order to safeguard and consolidate peace, but to lead the matter to the expansion of the area of military conflict, bringing humanity face to face with the threat of a world disaster. Therefore, for the consequences of this policy of the United States government, you bear a serious responsibility to mankind and history first and foremost. British Prime Minister Macmillan also bears a heavy responsibility. Because although he has tried to adapt to circumstances, he is in essence also implementing the same policy aimed at obstructing any measures to eliminate the military conflicts in Lebanon and Jordan.

In view of the current extremely tense situation in the Middle East region, the Soviet government still believes that it is necessary to immediately convene a summit conference of the five countries—the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, France, and India—with the participation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

As for the venue for the conference, we have noted that the French Head of Government Mr. de Gaulle stated in his letter of July 26 that he hopes that this meeting will be held in Europe. The Soviet government had previously advocated holding this conference in Europe, and therefore supports Mr. de Gaulle's proposal.

Since voices have been raised in United States diplomatic circles and the press saying that if the conference were held in the United States, the United States authorities would encounter difficulties in ensuring the safety of the heads of government, the issue of holding the summit conference in a city in Europe should be considered in particular. We do not want to put the United States government in a difficult position on this issue. Therefore, the Soviet government, on the one hand, like before, does not object to holding the conference in New York, and at the same time agrees to hold the conference in Geneva, Vienna, Paris, or any other location that is acceptable to all participants.

We also welcome reaching an agreement on holding a summit conference in Moscow. The Soviet government can fully guarantee the safety of the delegations of all countries and provide the necessary conditions for carrying out productive work. We are convinced that the Soviet people will welcome the envoys who come here to take urgent measures to stop the Middle East conflict and consolidate world peace, and the Soviet people will thereby show their unwavering fidelity to the cause of peace.

Your letter avoids mentioning the issue of the participation of the Indian Prime Minister in the summit conference. In this regard, I think it is necessary to once again emphasize that India's participation in the above-mentioned conference is of great significance for reaching constructive resolutions to resolve the Middle East situation.

As for the date of holding a summit conference with the participation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, we proposed holding it on July 28. Since you say that this date is too hasty for the United States government, we are willing to find another recent date, and hope that you can clearly reply: when is the United States willing to participate in the summit conference of the five countries?

Mr. President, I hope you can give me a reply as soon as possible.

                  With respect,

                  N. Khrushchev
                        July 28, 1958

### 赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信

专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信美国总统德怀特·艾森豪威尔先生阁下：总统先生：
    我收到了您7月25日答复我7月23日关于召开政府首脑会议的信的回信。
    遗憾的是，我不得不指出，美国政府在这封回信中背离了它在7月22日所采取的关于迅速召开有各国政府首脑参加的安理会特别会议来讨论中近东局势的立场。
    现在很清楚，美国政府是在拖延政府首脑会议的召开，不愿意这个会议采取紧急措施来和平解决中近东地区所发生的军事冲突。
    不能不指出，您在7月22日信中说您同意在安理会范围内召开政府首脑会议，这个表示受到了各国的欢迎。苏联、美国、英国、法国和印度关于政府首脑会晤的协议使人得到某些安慰，各国人民完全有理由期待这次会议于最近召开并且保证维护和巩固中近东的和平。苏联政府声明它同意麦克米伦先生的这个建议，因为英国首相建议在安全理事会范围内举行政府首脑会议时，明白指出，在举行这个会议的过程中不应提出未经事先商妥的任何决议案，还明白指出我们共同工作的目的是要达成会有成果的协议，而不是通过表决确定分歧。
    您现在的回答是从已达成的协议后退一步，因此自然不能不引起各国人民的严重忧虑。美国政府建议，不必由五国政府首脑讨论危及和平事业的中近东局势，而主张重新把这个问题提交联合国安全理事会普通会议。英国首相麦克米伦先生现在也支持这个建议。但是这会产生什么结果呢？您清楚地知道，安全理事会已经花很长时间讨论过了黎巴嫩和约旦的局势，然而迄今毫无结果。
    现在，制止对中近东的武装侵略这一问题是十分尖锐的，从安全理事会近来所举行的会议的经验看来，它是无力在其常会上就这个问题作出迅速有效的决定的。
    在这一地区，正在不断聚集武装力量，这一地区日益变成一触即发并可能引起世界灾难的火药库。在这种情况下，必须立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏联、美国、英国、法国和印度五国政府首脑会议，因为他们拥有高度的权力，能够就立即停止中近东地区军事冲突和就采取维护和巩固世界和平的措施达成协议。
    十分明显，如果我们真诚希望找寻缓和紧张局势的途径，那么我们就应当同意，在这种情况下这五个国家首先应议定维护和巩固和平的必要措施。如果这五国就立即停止中近东武装冲突达成协议，那么真正关心巩固和平的任何其他国家就会欢迎和支持这种决定，这一点难道有谁会怀疑吗？
    麦克米伦先生7月22日提出在安理会范围内举行政府首脑会议的建议，也正是规定了政府首脑会议的这种性质。但是，正如我已经指出的，您，总统先生和英国首相现在又背离了这个建议。不能不看到，这样一来，所采取的方针就是要葬送已取得的关于尽快召开苏、美、英、法、印五国政府首脑会议的协议。
    我们是不能接受这一点的。
    苏联政府坚持为维护和巩固和平而斗争的立场，坚持社会经济制度不同的各国和平共处的立场。苏联政府始终不渝地主张通过谈判用和平的手段来解决冲突。因此我们现在也坚决主张立即制止侵略，坚决主张干涉军迅速撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    我们深信，正是五国政府首脑会议，在各方具有诚意的情况下，会有助于找到消除中近东地区军事冲突的道路和可能性，并且安定中近东地区的局势。
    在这方面苏联政府对法国政府首脑戴高乐先生在他的7月26日的信中所提出的意见表示满意，他表示他支持关于立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的五国政府首脑会议的建议，我们认为这个意见同苏联政府就这个问题的建议没有分歧。我们认为，正如以前所声明过的，这是能够保证最迅速地解决停止中近东军事冲突这一刻不容缓的任务的最正确的道路。
    为了进一步拖延政府首脑会议的召开，您的信中借口说，美国政府提出的关于政府首脑会议的措词没有得到理解。那么，不禁要问：是不是故意把这种措词提得可以作各种解释，并且为了精确地说明它的意义而必须函件往返，浪费时间呢。既然您7月22日的来信表示同意参加有政府首脑参加的安理会特别会议，那么，在这种情况下，我们不能不把这理解成为您同意最迅速地召开这种会议。现在您回避最迅速地召开这个会议，而建议重新读一读您7月22日的信。您的这些话证明美国政府显然不愿意最迅速地采取措施来制止对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉，此外，难道能作别的理解吗？
    总统先生，我直言不讳地说，美国和英国政府所采取的方针实质上是拒绝政府首脑会议的方针，不能不引起各国人民的不安，因为各国人民焦急地期待着能够结束中近东的武装冲突并采取维护和巩固普遍和平的措施。
    各国的舆论界人士怀着不安的心情提出一个问题：应对中近东目前紧张局势负责的国家的政府是不是想麻痹人民的警惕性偷偷地策划新的侵略行动。
    要知道，美国政府比谁都清楚，美国军队继续在黎巴嫩登陆，在那里，在美国刺刀的支持和掩护下，国务院特使墨菲展开的行迹可疑的活动，他横暴无礼地干涉黎巴嫩的内政。美国海军正在地中海东部集结，美国增援部队正在从欧洲空运到中近东，特别是土耳其的亚达那地区。在这方面特别值得注意的还有：在土耳其本国最近也广泛地准备武装干涉阿拉伯东方各国的内政。失去了本国人民支持的、依靠干涉者撑腰的约旦国王侯赛因竟敢用武力进行威胁，扬言要向巴格达进军。他是那些策划反阿拉伯东方各国人民阴谋的、人所共知的西方国家手中的驯顺工具。现在可以看到有扩大侵略区的明显趋势。军事进攻的威胁笼罩着伊拉克共和国。
    由此可见，拖延五国政府首脑会议的谈判，并同时在中近东日益大量集结武装部队，这样就会导致局势的进一步尖锐化，导致冲突的扩大，并且可能使人类遭到灾难。
    现在比过去任何时候都更加需要采取迅速有力的行动，以保证使外国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，并且使在中近东的武装冲突地区不致扩大。时间是不等人的。
    但是，不能不指出，美国政府不仅没有促进政府首脑会议迅速召开，以便立即停止中近东地区的武装冲突，反而派自己的国务卿去伦敦参加巴格达条约成员国的会议。有人正在急忙企图为这个条约打补丁，而这个条约的唯一的一个阿拉伯国家——伊拉克退出这个条约的事实，再一次表明了西方国家所执行的“实力地位”政策和拼凑侵略集团政策已经失败。同时美国政府企图百般阻挠解决全人类所期待解决的当前主要问题——停止美国和英国在中近东的武装干涉问题。美国政府企图使关于政府首脑会议的谈判陷入无止境的讨论这个会议的形式和程序的迷宫中。
    英国、美国、土耳其、巴基斯坦和伊朗政府代表伦敦会议是在这样的情况下举行的：这时外国军队不仅没有从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出，而且正在开足马力地准备着武装干涉伊拉克共和国的事务，因此这个会议是反对阿拉伯国家的阴谋。这一切做法，其目的难道不是在阴谋策划新的侵略行动，用执行既成事实的政策的办法使世界面临日益扩大的军事冲突吗？
    难道能不考虑这种政策首先对它的策划者所产生的严重后果吗？因为在我们的时代人民是充分警惕的，是不会容忍侵略行动的。
    美国政府竭力破坏五国政府首脑会晤，这次会晤是要终止对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉，采取维护和巩固世界和平的紧急措施。
    因此，您所走的道路不是解决中近东已经开始的军事冲突，以维护和巩固和平，而是把事情引向扩大军事冲突地区，使人类面临世界灾难的威胁，因此，对于美国政府这种政策的后果，您首先对人类和历史负有严重的责任。英国首相麦克米伦先生也负有严重责任。因为他尽管试图随机应变，但实质上也是执行旨在阻挠采取任何措施来消除黎巴嫩和约旦军事冲突的同样的政策。
    苏联政府鉴于中近东地区当前极端紧张的局势，仍旧认为必须立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、美、英、法、印五国政府首脑会议。
    至于举行会议的地点，我们已注意到法国政府首脑戴高乐先生在7月26日信中所说的他希望这次会晤在欧洲举行这一点。苏联政府早先就主张这次会议在欧洲举行，因此支持戴高乐先生的建议。
    由于美国外交界和报刊已经发出呼声，说若是会议在美国召开，美国当局将在保障政府首脑的安全方面碰到困难，这样就尤其应该考虑在欧洲的某个城市里举行政府首脑会议的问题。我们不愿意使美国政府在这个问题上处于为难的境地。因此苏联政府一方面像从前一样，不反对在纽约召开会议，同时也同意在日内瓦、维也纳、巴黎或者能为全体参加者接受的任何其他地点召开会议。
    我们也欢迎达成关于在莫斯科举行政府首脑会议的协议，苏联政府能完全保障各国代表团的安全，并提供为进行有成效的工作所必要的条件。我们深信，苏联人民将欢迎为了采取紧急措施以停止中近东冲突和巩固世界和平而来到这里的使者，苏联人民将借此表明他们毫不动摇地忠实于和平事业。
    您的信中避而不谈印度总理参加政府首脑会议的问题。在这方面，我认为必须再次着重指出，印度参加上述会议对于达成解决中近东局势的建设性决议具有巨大的意义。
    至于举行有联合国秘书长参加的政府首脑会议的日期，我们曾提出在7月28日举行。既然您说这个日子对美国政府来说太仓促了，我们愿意另外找一个最近的日子，并且希望您能明确地答复：美国愿意在什么时候参加五国政府首脑会议。
    总统先生，希望您能尽早给我回信。
                  此致敬意　尼·赫鲁晓夫
