Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 4th. Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that a new situation of a comprehensive upsurge in agricultural technology revolution has begun to appear in the rural areas of Guangdong Province. The Party's task is to immediately transform it into a surging mass movement in which all farmers participate, and strive to basically cross the agricultural technology reform barrier centered on close planting next year. Comrade Tao Zhu recently inspected the rural areas of Shantou and Huiyang for twenty days. On June 27, he spoke to the heads of the Shantou Prefectural Committee and expressed the above opinions.

Comrade Tao Zhu said that a significant sign of the rising agricultural technology revolution is the emergence of a large number of advanced elements in rural areas. They dare to break all conventions and boldly conduct experiments on high yields of various crops. For example: to produce 5,500 jin of rice per mu per season, 130,000 jin of sweet potatoes, 200,000 jin of sugarcane, 10,000 jin of oranges, and raise pigs weighing 1,000 jin. Such bold targets, which have never been heard of in the past, are now emerging from all directions. This shows that the people have awakened from the superstition of the "limited grain production theory." The proposal of these indicators will inevitably bring a new set of production measures and new production methods, which will inevitably cause a struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the conservative, and promote the overall situation forward. This forms a vigorous high tide of agricultural technology revolution.

Comrade Tao Zhu said that the proposal of these advanced indicators is not just to sensationalize, but to strive to achieve them with a new set of specifications and measures. Taking rice production as an example, Lihu Township in Puning County proposed a yield of 5,000 jin per mu per season, and Qipan Commune in Jieyang County proposed a yield of 5,500 jin per mu. Both have done some scientific research and preparation. For example, the key to achieving high yields lies in implementing close planting and increasing the number of ears. Therefore, Qipan Commune determined that high-yield fields should adopt the "ants emerging from their nests" planting method, i.e., 0.5-inch (plant spacing) by 4-inch (row spacing), planting 300,000 plants per mu, with 5 effective ears per plant, totaling 1.5 million ears; with an average of 90 grains per ear, 135 million grains can be obtained, equivalent to 6,750 jin. Even if the actual yield is calculated at 85%, the yield per mu can still exceed 5,500 jin.

Comrade Tao Zhu said that with these daring and proactive people stirring up trouble everywhere and daring to break conventions, the agricultural production front will not be as conservative and dull as in the past, but a giant wave will follow another and surge forward, creating a brand-new situation of high-speed agricultural production increase.

Comrade Tao Zhu said: Another sign of the rising agricultural technology revolution is the rapid growth of high-yield experimental fields in the late rice crop this year. Chao'an, a nationally renowned high-yield rice county, plans to cultivate 100,000 mu of experimental fields with yields of 2,000 to 3,000 jin per mu in the late crop. In addition, each agricultural cooperative will cultivate one or two mu of experimental fields with a yield requirement of 5,000 jin. Experimental fields account for 30% of the county's late crop cultivated land area. It is estimated that the high-yield experimental fields in the entire Shantou Prefecture will reach 1.1 million mu, accounting for a quarter of the prefecture's cultivated land area, with a general yield requirement of 2,000 to 3,000 jin per mu, and a very small number of experimental fields requiring 5,000 jin. This large-scale experimental field movement, in which all cadres, all Party members, League members, and a large number of activists participate, is being promoted throughout Guangdong Province. It is estimated that the province can expand to at least 5 million mu or more, while the early crop experimental fields were only 1 million mu. Expanding the area of experimental fields and improving the specifications of experimental fields are extremely important for popularizing and improving the experience of agricultural bumper harvests, strengthening the technical reform team, and ensuring that Guangdong Province achieves the target of 800 jin of grain per mu this year, or at the latest next year.

Comrade Tao Zhu said that the third and most important sign of the rising agricultural technology revolution is that more and more farmers have joined this movement. If many farmers did not believe that close planting could increase production during the early crop this year, they have now consciously broken the old concept that close planting cannot increase production and the old farming habits, and believe in and support close planting. Especially after the vigorous promotion of the general line, the broad masses have realized that agricultural technology reform centered on close planting is a major measure to get rid of agricultural backwardness, ensure continuous production increase, and improve farmers' lives. The ideological liberation of the farmers immediately turned into enthusiastic practical action.

What is agricultural technology revolution? Comrade Tao Zhu said: In today's terms, it is a series of technical innovation movements centered on the highest degree of close planting. Close planting is the central issue of the current agricultural technology revolution, and agricultural technology revolution is the key to promoting all work. Close planting will inevitably cause profound changes in various farming techniques and measures. For example, close planting of rice requires timely irrigation and drainage, which prompts us to find ways to improve the quality of water conservancy and establish a complete irrigation and drainage system; it requires the soil quality to increase organic matter content, be soft and moderate, and the ratio of clay and sand to be appropriate, which prompts us to implement deep plowing, crop rotation, and soil improvement; it requires the supply of a large amount of sufficient fertilizer and rational fertilization, which will inevitably promote us to conduct scientific research and processing of fertilizers and establish a large-scale fertilizer production system. In addition, close planting also requires the selection and breeding of fine varieties suitable for close planting, early sowing and early transplanting, sparse sowing and strong seedlings, and false transplanting of seedlings, requiring strict field management. All of these require reform of cultivation techniques. At the same time, close planting will inevitably cause changes in labor organization, labor management methods, production tools, and operation methods. The high yields and bumper harvests that come with close planting will surely accelerate the implementation of agricultural mechanization and promote the further development of industry and transportation, and accelerate the popularization and improvement of rural culture and science. Not only that, it will also affect and gradually change people's ideological viewpoints and mental outlook. For example, in the past, it was always thought that there were too many people and too little land in the Chaoshan Plain, but now it has begun to feel that it is not that there is too little land, but that there are too few people (insufficient labor). Chenqiao Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Chao'an County can also live the life of a prosperous middle peasant with only a few points of land per person after the production increase plan is completed this year.

Comrade Tao Zhu said that the conditions for carrying out the agricultural technology revolution are now fully mature. As mentioned above, under the glorious illumination of the general line, the broad masses of cadres and people have greatly liberated their minds, increased their confidence a hundredfold, enthusiastically supported the technological revolution, and have already taken active action. Comrade Tao Zhu also pointed out: The technological revolution movement currently underway is a whirlwind, coming very fiercely, with very sharp turns. Some cadres and the masses feel unaccustomed for a while, and even have some doubts in their minds, which is an inevitable phenomenon. Because the technical reforms require such strictness, the amount of work will inevitably increase several times, and the arrangement of labor has become a more prominent problem. For some technical problems, because experience is still insufficient, difficulties also exist. It should also be seen that some prosperous middle peasants in rural areas have adopted an opposing attitude towards a series of technical reforms centered on close planting. The technological revolution is by no means a purely technical issue, but contains serious ideological struggle. This requires Party committees at all levels to grasp action on one hand and grasp ideology on the other. When ideological problems are thoroughly resolved, specific difficulties will be easily resolved. (Attached photo)

    广东农业技术革命的新形势
    先进分子大量涌现　高产试验田迅速增长　群众运动规模越来越大
    新华社广州4日电　中共广东省委第一书记陶铸说，广东省农村已开始出现农业技术革命全面高涨的新形势，党的任务是：立刻把它变成为全体农民参加的、汹涌澎湃的群众运动。力争在明年基本跨过以密植为中心的农业技术改革关。陶铸同志最近在汕头、惠阳两个专区的农村视察了二十天。6月27日他向汕头地委负责人谈了以上意见。
    陶铸同志说，农业技术革命形势开始高涨的一个显著的标志，是农村中先进分子大量涌现。他们敢于突破一切陈规，大胆地进行各种作物高产的试验。例如：每亩地一造要生产五千五百斤的稻谷，十三万斤番薯，二十万斤甘蔗，一万斤柑桔和养出一千斤重的猪。像这样大胆的指标，过去从未听到过的，现在正从四面八方涌现出来。这说明了人民从“粮食增产有限论”的迷信中惊醒过来了。这些指标的提出还必然带来一套新的生产措施和新的生产方法，也就必然引起一场新与旧的、先进与保守的斗争，推动全局向前发展。这就形成了一个轰轰烈烈的农业技术革命高潮。
    陶铸同志说，提出这些先进指标，并不是凭空说来耸人听闻的，而是有一套新规格和新措施来力争实现的。以稻谷生产为例，普宁县鲤湖乡提出一造亩产五千斤，揭阳县棋盘社提出亩产五千五百斤，都做了一些科学研究和准备工作。例如，取得高产的关键在于实行密植，增加穗数，因此棋盘社确定高产田采取“蚂蚁出洞”即零点五寸（株距）乘四寸（行距）的插秧法，每亩插足三十万科，每科有效穗五穗，共一百五十万穗；每穗平均九十粒，可得一亿三千五百万粒，折合为六千七百五十斤，就以实收85％计，每亩产量还可超过五千五百斤。
    陶铸同志说，有了这些敢想敢为的人到处兴风作浪，敢于打破陈规，就能够使农业生产战线上不会像过去那样保守沉闷，而是一个巨浪接着一个巨浪向前涌进，出现一个农业高速度增产的簇新局面。
    陶铸同志说：农业技术革命开始高涨的另一个标志，是今年晚造高产试验田的迅速增长。全国著名的水稻高产县——潮安，计划晚造要搞亩产二千斤到三千斤的试验田十万亩，另外，每个农业社都搞一、二亩产量要求达到五千斤的试验田，试验田占该县晚造耕地面积的30％。整个汕头专区的高产试验田，估计要达到一百一十万亩，占全区耕地面积的四分之一，要求亩产量一般做到二千斤到三千斤，极少数的试验田则要做到五千斤。汕头专区的这种有全体干部、所有党团员并带动广大积极分子参加的大搞试验田运动，正在广东全省推广，预计全省至少可以扩大到五百万亩以上。而早造试验田只有一百万亩。扩大试验田的面积，提高试验田的规格，对于普及与提高农业丰产的经验，壮大技术改革队伍，保证广东省在今年，至迟明年，实现亩产粮食八百斤的指标，是极为重要的。
    陶铸同志说，农业技术革命开始高涨的第三个，也是最重要的一个标志，是越来越多的农民群众投入这个运动中来了。如果说今年早造时许多农民还不大相信密植能获得增产的话，那么，现在他们已经自觉地打破了密植不能增产的陈旧观念和老一套的耕作习惯，相信和拥护密植了。特别是大张旗鼓的宣传总路线以后，广大群众已认识到：以密植为中心的农业技术改革，是摆脱农业落后状态，保证不断增产和改善农民生活的重大措施。农民群众思想上的解放，立即变成了热火朝天的实际行动。
    什么是农业技术革命？陶铸同志说：在今天来讲，就是实行以最高度的密植为中心的一系列的技术革新运动。密植是当前农业技术革命的中心问题，而农业技术革命又是推动一切工作的锁钥。密植必然引起各项耕作技术措施的深刻变化。例如水稻密植，就要适时排灌，这就促使我们必须想办法提高水利质量，建立完整的排灌系统；要求土质提高有机成分，松软适度，粘土和沙的比例恰当，这就促使我们必须实行深翻、轮种和改良土壤；要求供给大量足够的肥料，进行合理施肥，这又必然促使我们进行肥料的科学研究和加工，建立大规模的肥料生产系统。此外，密植还要求选育适合密植所需的良种，要求早播早插、疏播壮秧和秧的假植，要求严格的田间管理。这些都必须进行耕作技术的改革。同时，密植也必然会引起劳动组织、劳动管理方法和生产工具、操作方法的变革。随着密植而来的高产丰收，就一定会加速实行农业机械化和推动工业和交通运输业的进一步发展，加快农村文化科学的普及与提高。不仅如此，它还将影响和逐步改变人们的思想观点和精神面貌。例如，过去总认为潮汕平原人口太多，土地太少，现在已开始感觉到不是土地太少，而是人口太少（劳动力不够）了。潮安县陈桥农牧社在今年增产计划完成后，每人几分地也可以过富裕中农的生活。
    陶铸同志说，现在开展农业技术革命的条件，已经完全成熟。上面已经谈到，广大干部和群众，在总路线的光辉照耀下，思想大解放，信心百倍提高，热烈拥护技术革命，并且已经积极行动起来。陶铸同志同时指出：目前正在开展的技术革命运动，是一场急风骤雨，来势很猛，弯子转得很急，一部分干部和群众一时感到不习惯，甚至在思想上或多或少产生一些疑虑，那是不可避免的现象。因为技术改革要求如此严格，工作量势必增加好几倍，劳动力的安排就成了更突出的问题。对于某些技术上的问题，因为经验还不足，困难也是存在着。还应当看到，农村中的一些富裕中农对以密植为中心的一系列的技术改革是采取反对态度的。技术革命决不是单纯的技术问题，包含有严重的思想斗争。这就需要各级党委一边抓行动，一边抓思想，思想问题解决得彻底，具体困难就容易解决。（附图片）
