    In the New Product Display Counter

    Recently, at the new product sample counter specially set up on the third floor of the Wangfujing Department Store in Beijing, more than one hundred new products from Shanghai after the Great Leap Forward are on display. These include "Train" brand long-hand luminous clocks, "Flying Fish" brand 100-count warp-knitted scarves, fine wool sweaters with various fragrances such as rose and sandalwood, novel jacquard pillow towels, bath towels, various colored glass cups, various knitted shirts, handmade nylon gloves of various sizes, "Forever" brand bicycles, and a type of soap that can whiten clothes, etc. These products are not only novel in design, good in quality, and beautiful in style, but some products have even caught up with and surpassed international standards. For example, Shanghai's "Flying Fish" brand scarves have surpassed the American "Tower" brand scarves; Shanghai's "Pacific" brand bath towels surpass the American "Cannon" brand bath towels. The warp tensile strength of this bath towel is 2.6 kilograms greater than that of the American "Cannon" brand bath towel.

    Among these new samples, there are also many reactive dye cotton sweaters. They look similar in color to ordinary cotton sweaters, but their characteristic is that they maintain their original color permanently when exposed to the sun and washed with water. There are also various "Chrysanthemum" brand vests produced by Shanghai Zhonghua No. 1 Knitting Factory. Not only are the colors beautiful, but the weaving method is different from ordinary vests. If an ordinary vest breaks with a small hole, it will unravel, but this type of fabric does not have this defect.

    Next to a bicycle, someone said, "If the brand name were covered up, someone would definitely say this is an imported product." This is Shanghai's "Forever" brand bicycle. This bicycle is indeed more beautiful in style and better in quality than the British "Raleigh" bicycle, and it is light and fast to ride.

    Of these new samples on display, more than sixty have already been sold. (Yin Shaoqing)

    在新产品专柜里
    最近，在北京市王府井百货商店三楼特设的新产品样品专柜里，陈列出一百多种大跃进后上海的新产品，有火车牌长针夜明钟、飞鱼牌一百支经条的纱巾、带有玫瑰、檀香等各种香味的细羊毛衫、新颖的提花枕巾、浴巾、各种花玻璃杯、各式线衣、手工制的各种尺码的尼龙手套，永久牌自行车，还有一种可以使衣服洁白的肥皂等等。这些产品不但花色新颖、质量好，式样美观，而且有些产品已经赶上和超过国际水平。如上海飞鱼牌纱巾已经压倒美国塔牌纱巾；上海太平洋牌浴巾超过美国大炮牌浴巾。这种浴巾经向强力比美国大炮牌浴巾多二点六公斤。
    在这些新样品里，也陈列了许多活性染料棉毛衫，看上去颜色和普通棉毛衫差不多，但是它的特点是日晒水洗，永久保持本色。这里还有上海中华第一针织厂生产的各式菊花牌背心，不但颜色美观，织的方法和一般的背心不同，一般背心穿破一个小洞，就会跳线，这种织物就没有这种缺点。
    在一辆自行车旁边，有一个人说：“如果把车牌子盖上，一定会有人说这是进口货”。这就是上海的永久牌自行车，这种车确比英国的凤头车样式美观，质量好，骑上又轻又快。
    这些展出的新样品中，有六十多种已经出售。　（尹少卿）
