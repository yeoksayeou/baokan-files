    The Lackey's Flattery
  　Tian Ma
    Just as the American aggressors were being condemned by people all over the world and couldn't step down, Japan proposed a resolution in the Security Council: to expand the activities of the United Nations observer group under the condition that American troops occupy Lebanon, attempting to make the United Nations a tool for American interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.
    The lackey's flattery is naturally appreciated by the master, but this accomplice's proposal was rejected by the Soviet Union. This greatly disappointed the American aggressors and their lackeys.
    The Japanese government has been a lackey of American imperialism for many years. They have sold the interests of the Japanese people, including themselves, to the United States, and they still feel it is not enough. They even妄想to sell out the people of the Middle Eastern countries in order to get a few more rewards from it. To be reduced to a lackey and willing to be a lackey is a complete slavishness and slave mentality; to take pleasure in being a lackey and to pull others to be lackeys is an especially deep expression of slavishness and slave mentality. The behavior of the Kishi Nobusuke government precisely shows that it is an incurable lackey.
    However, the people of the Middle East are unwilling to be lackeys. The Japanese government—this faithful lackey of American imperialism—judges others' hearts by its own mean measure, thinking that others will learn from him. It is truly "a mosquito eating a Bodhisattva - mistaking the person!"
    Now people all over the world are opposing the American and British aggressors, and everywhere there is a cry of "Americans and British get out!" The master's future is already very bad. The lackey's ending can be imagined.

    奴才的献媚
  　天马
    正当美国侵略者受到全世界人民谴责下不了台的时候，日本在安理会提出一个提案：在美国军队占领黎巴嫩的条件下，扩大联合国观察团的活动，企图使联合国成为美国干涉黎巴嫩内政的工具。
    奴才的献媚，主子自然欣赏，但是这一帮凶的提案被苏联否决了。这使美国侵略者和他的奴才都大失所望。
    日本政府做美帝国主义的奴才已经多年，他们把日本人民的利益连同自身一起都出卖给美国还嫌不足，还妄想出卖中东国家的人民，以便从中再得到几个赏钱。沦为奴才而甘于奴才者是一种十足的奴性和奴骨；以作奴才为乐趣而又拉别人来作奴才，是奴性和奴骨尤其深重的表现。岸信介政府的行为，正是表明它是一个不可救药的奴才。
    然而中东人民是不甘愿做奴才的。日本政府——这个美帝国主义的忠实奴才，以小人之心度君子之腹，以为别人也会学他的样，真是“蚊虫吃菩萨——认错了人”！
    现在全世界人民都在反对美英侵略者，到处是一片美国英国滚出去的声音，主子的前途已经很不妙，奴才的结局如何，是可以想像得到的。
