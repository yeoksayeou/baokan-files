    Introduce More Arabic Literary Works
    In recent days, with respect and support for the people of Lebanon and Iraq, we have been excitedly following the news from the Middle East. To further satisfy our understanding of these Arab countries, we would like to find some materials about the historical sites, customs, and reflect their life and national liberation struggle of folk songs, folk tales, literature and art works, but the result was very disappointing. After searching all libraries and bookstores, we only found a few brochures introducing general information, and some materials are also relatively old. The only one is the "Collection of Arabic Short Stories" published by the Writers Publishing House, which is far from satisfying the readers' desire to understand these countries.
    I remember that Mr. Lu Xun advocated the introduction of the literature of the so-called "oppressed nations and peoples" during his lifetime. Lu Xun and progressive literary artists of his generation translated and published many literary works of anti-colonial countries. These works helped the Chinese people understand some oppressed countries, thus strengthening their determination to oppose imperialism and domestic feudal forces. Now the international situation has changed greatly, the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, imperialism is in a terrible state, and the flames of anti-colonialism are burning everywhere. The victorious Chinese people have always been concerned about and supported the struggles of these countries, so literary works reflecting the life and struggle of the people of these countries are urgently needed by readers!
    We suggest to the relevant publishing houses to publish more literary books introducing Arab countries!

    多介绍些阿拉伯文艺作品
    这几天，怀着对黎巴嫩、伊拉克人民尊敬和支持的心情，我们激奋地关注着报上从中东传来的消息。为了更进一步满足我们对这些阿拉伯国家的了解，我们很想找一点有关这些国家历史古迹、风土人情，以及反映他们生活和民族解放斗争的民歌、民间故事，文学艺术作品等材料，结果非常失望，跑遍了图书馆和书店，只能找到几本介绍一般概况的小册子，有些材料也比较陈旧了。唯一的一本是作家出版社出版的“阿拉伯短篇小说集”，这远不能满足读者想了解这些国家的渴望。
    记得鲁迅先生生前曾提倡介绍过那时所谓的“被压迫国家民族的文学”，鲁迅和他同代的进步文艺家就翻译和出版了不少反殖民主义国家的文艺作品。这些作品帮助了中国人民对一些被压迫国家人民的了解，从而更加坚定了反对帝国主义、反对本国封建势力的决心。现在国际形势已经大变，东风压倒了西风，帝国主义狼狈不堪，反殖民主义的火焰正四处燃起，胜利了的中国人民也是一直关心和支持着这些国家人民的斗争的，因此反映这些国家人民生活、斗争的文艺作品是读者迫切需要的！
    我们向有关出版社建议，多出些介绍阿拉伯国家的文学书籍！
