The members of the delegation included many university presidents wearing gold necklaces, as well as outstanding People's Scientists and State Prize winners Professor Vollmer and Professor Thiessen, Chairman of the Research Council of the German Democratic Republic and Lenin Prize winner.

Speaking on behalf of the scientists, Thiessen said to the Congress that the scientific workers of the German Democratic Republic deeply appreciate the Party and government's emphasis on scientific work and trust in scientists. He solemnly assured the Congress that the scientific workers are determined to unite with workers and peasants and contribute all their strength to the common cause of the motherland and socialist construction.

Cheers and applause rang out in the hall when Abdel Kader Wahra, representative of the Algerian Communist Party, addressed the Congress. He said that although the Algerian people are still in blood and tears, they will overcome all difficulties and give the French colonialists increasingly powerful blows.

Lovlien, Chairman of the Norwegian Communist Party, addressed the Congress on behalf of the fraternal parties of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland. The fraternal party delegations that addressed the Congress today also included Hannel, member of the Political Bureau of the Austrian Communist Party, and Radmanesh, First Secretary of the Iranian People's Party.

This afternoon, delegations from fraternal parties, together with some delegates from the Congress, laid wreaths at the German Socialist Pioneers Cemetery in Berlin and the Soviet Martyrs Cemetery.

Those who spoke in today's general debate included Heinrich Rau and Neumann, members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the SED, Honecker, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, Apel, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Central Political Bureau, Hager, Secretary of the Central Committee, Lange, Minister of Education of the German Democratic Republic, Sellbmann, Vice-Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Dahlem, Deputy Director of the Higher Education Administration, and Kosel, Deputy Minister of Construction, as well as representatives from cities such as Karl-Marx-Stadt, Wismar, and Erfurt.

Honecker's speech focused on the importance of further improving the Party's work in the armed forces. He pointed out that the relationship between officers and soldiers of the armed forces and the working people must be even closer. He said that the political and training work of the workers' pickets in enterprises has been continuously strengthened under the leadership of the Party. The fact that weapons are in the hands of the workers is the fullest manifestation that the struggle of the working class has finally won.

In his speech, Heinrich Rau focused on foreign trade issues. He pointed out that in order to increase the import of consumer goods, it is necessary to increase exports accordingly. This requires improving labor productivity and practicing strict economy. He called for reducing unnecessary reserves and unplanned surpluses.
