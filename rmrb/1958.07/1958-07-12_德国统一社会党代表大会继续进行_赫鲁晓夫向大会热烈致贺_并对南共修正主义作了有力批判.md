Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 11th: The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) continued its session this morning at nine o'clock. After the executive chairman of the congress, Heinrich Rau, announced the opening of the session, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly to congratulate the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic. The audience also warmly applauded to welcome the arrival of the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Party delegations.

Then, Heinrich Rau invited Khrushchev, the head of the Soviet Communist Party delegation and First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, to speak. As Khrushchev walked to the podium, the entire audience stood up, enthusiastically shouted "Hurrah" three times, and applauded for a long time to express their welcome.

Khrushchev, on behalf of the CPSU Central Committee, all CPSU members, and the Soviet people, extended warm fraternal congratulations to the congress and all members of the SED.

In his two-hour speech, Khrushchev talked about the great achievements made by the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp in the economic field. He cited figures to illustrate that the Soviet Union had almost caught up with or even surpassed the United States in the output of many products. Amid thunderous applause, Khrushchev announced that the Soviet government had decided to waive the portion of the maintenance costs for the Soviet troops stationed in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) that was originally borne by the GDR, starting from January 1, 1959. He expressed his belief that this measure would help strengthen the friendship between the two peoples. Khrushchev then pointed out the dangers of modern revisionism, represented by the Yugoslav Communist leadership, and gave a powerful critique. Finally, Khrushchev read out the congratulatory message from the CPSU Central Committee. His speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the audience.

When he finished speaking and warmly embraced Ulbricht, Grotewohl, and Heinrich Rau in succession, the enthusiastic atmosphere of the meeting reached its peak. The hall resounded with shouts of "Hurrah" and prolonged applause, followed by the singing of the Internationale.

The executive chairman of the congress then announced a half-hour recess, and the session will continue this afternoon.

At yesterday evening's session, Gäbler, a member of the Central Auditing Commission of the SED, delivered a report to the congress on the work of the Central Auditing Commission. The report pointed out that the working methods of some party organizations must be improved. The various departments under the Central Committee need to better share the work of the Party Central Committee. The report argued that the party's educational work and political ideological work among the masses should be mainly carried out through grassroots organizations. This requires the county committees to better focus on this aspect of their work.

The report was followed by a general discussion. The first speaker was Erich Seifert, a labor hero from Karl-Marx-Stadt. This labor hero has now become a banner for the movement to break old production quotas and improve labor productivity in the GDR. Ulbricht also mentioned this advanced figure in his report, saying that his advanced methods were based on ideological liberation and improved production targets. In his speech, Seifert emphasized that opposing waste of time and setting new targets were by no means purely technical work. The purpose of improving working methods is to produce more, better, and cheaper materials for our worker-peasant state.

Gustav Dreher, a farmer party member from the Rostock district, vividly described his own ideological struggle in joining the cooperative and the party. The speakers who followed included a young engineer from the Riesa metallurgical plant, the director of the Leuna chemical plant, a female worker from the Gentin soap powder factory in the Magdeburg district, and a farmer from the "Thälmann" agricultural production cooperative in the Oschatz county.

    德国统一社会党代表大会继续进行
    赫鲁晓夫向大会热烈致贺
    并对南共修正主义作了有力批判
    新华社柏林11日电　德国统一社会党第五次代表大会今天上午九点起继续开会。大会执行主席海因里希·劳宣布开会后，全场首先起立热烈鼓掌，祝贺蒙古人民共和国诞生三十七周年。全场又热烈鼓掌，欢迎叙利亚和黎巴嫩共产党代表团的到达。
    接着海因里希·劳请苏联共产党代表团团长、苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫讲话。当赫鲁晓夫走向讲台时，全场起立，热情地高呼三声“乌拉”，并且长时间地鼓掌表示欢迎。
    赫鲁晓夫代表苏共中央、苏共全体党员和苏联人民向大会和德国统一社会党全体党员表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    在历时两小时的讲话中，赫鲁晓夫谈到苏联和整个社会主义阵营在经济方面所取得的巨大成就。他列举数字说明在许多种产品的产量方面，苏联已经几乎赶上或者已经超过了美国。赫鲁晓夫在暴风雨般的掌声中宣布，苏联政府决定从1959年1月1日起放弃驻民主德国苏军的维持费中原来由民主德国负担的部分。他表示相信，这个措施将有助于加强两国人民之间的友谊。赫鲁晓夫接着指出了以南共领导集团为代表的现代修正主义的危害性，并且给予了有力的批判。赫鲁晓夫最后宣读了苏共中央的贺词。他的讲话不断被全场热烈的掌声所打断。
    当他讲完话同乌布利希、格罗提渥和海因里希·劳相继热烈拥抱时，会场的热烈气氛达到了高峰。会议大厅里响起了“乌拉”声和长时间的鼓掌，接着唱起了国际歌。
    大会执行主席接着宣布休会半小时，会议将在今天午后继续举行。
    在昨天晚间的会议上，德国统一社会党中央检查委员会委员盖布勒向大会做了中央检查委员会的报告。报告指出，某些党组织的工作方式必须加以改进。中央委员会所属各部有必要更好地分担党中央的工作。报告认为，党的教育工作和对群众的政治思想工作主要应该通过基层组织来进行。这就要求县委会更好地抓紧这方面的工作。
    报告之后接着开始了大会讨论。第一个发言的是来自卡尔·马克思斯塔特的劳动英雄埃里希·塞弗特。这位劳动英雄今天已经成了民主德国普遍打破旧生产定额、提高劳动生产率运动的一面旗帜。乌布利希在报告中也曾经提到这位先进人物，说他的先进方法是在思想解放的基础上提高生产指标。塞弗特在发言中强调说，反对浪费时间和制订新指标绝不是单纯的技术性工作。改进工作方法的目的是为了给我们的工农国家生产出更多、更好和更廉价的物资。
    罗斯托克专区的农民党员古斯塔夫·德累尔在发言中生动地叙述了他自己参加合作社和入党的思想斗争过程。接着发言的还有里扎冶金工厂的一位青年工程师、洛伊纳化学工厂的厂长、马格德堡专区根亭肥皂粉工厂的一位女工和来自奥夏兹县“台尔曼”农业生产合作社的一位农民。（附图片）
