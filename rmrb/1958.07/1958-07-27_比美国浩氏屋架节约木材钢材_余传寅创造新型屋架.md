　　Saving More Wood and Steel Than American Howe Truss
    Yu Chuanxin Creates New Type of Roof Truss

    (Our dispatch) Second Lieutenant Yu Chuanxin of the Logistics Department of the People’s Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou, displaying original spirit and sweeping away centuries of convention, has designed a type of unequal bay triangular roof truss. Under the same stress conditions, it can save an average of more than 15% of wood and steel compared to the “Howe truss” created by American civil engineering authority William Howe.

    In the past, the roof truss styles used in housing construction in our country were all designed according to the “Howe truss” created by the American William Howe in 1840. This roof truss style has been used worldwide for more than a hundred years. In actual work, Yu Chuanxin discovered that the main shortcoming of this equal bay roof truss was that it failed to fully utilize the potential of the materials, resulting in some waste. Once, when he was designing a large auditorium 20 meters wide according to the "Howe truss," he found that the "Howe truss" was designed based on the weakest part of the wood's resistance. It used the wood with high resistance (thick) and the wood with low resistance (thin) equally, failing to fully utilize the wood's inherent function, resulting in waste. From this, Yu Chuanxin began to doubt whether the "Howe truss" was advanced. Therefore, he wanted to break this "authoritative" design and research more advanced designs. He went to many libraries and read many civil engineering books, but could not find different opinions on the "Howe truss" or new calculation formulas. Therefore, he conducted meticulous and arduous calculations on the design formulas of various types of roof trusses. After more than a month of selfless labor day and night, he calculated a roof truss calculation program of approximately 200,000 words. From this, he found the rules for calculating various types of roof truss formulas with axial force changes. After further deliberation, he finally created a simple, accurate, and safe calculation formula for unequal bay roof trusses. The roof trusses designed according to this new formula can fully utilize the role of wood, saving an average of more than 15% of wood and steel compared to designs using the “Howe truss.” Recently, Yu Chuanxin designed a ten-room garage for a certain unit of the Guangzhou troops according to the unequal bay roof truss formula he created. This project was completed in mid-July and, after inspection, the quality was good. Yu Chuanxin only studied civil engineering for half a year at a secondary technical school. His creation has received the attention and praise of many experts and construction departments in our country.

### 比美国浩氏屋架节约木材钢材  余传寅创造新型屋架

    比美国浩氏屋架节约木材钢材
    余传寅创造新型屋架
    本报讯　人民解放军驻广州部队后勤部余传寅少尉，发挥独创精神，一扫百年陈规，设计出一种不等节间三角形屋架，它比美国土木工程权威专家威廉·浩所创造的“浩氏屋架”在同样受力情况下平均可节约木材、钢材15％以上。
    过去，我国建造房屋用的屋架式样，都是按照美国人威廉·浩在1840年所创造的“浩氏屋架”进行设计，这种屋架式样已在世界范围内沿用了一百多年。在实际工作中，余传寅发现了这种等节间屋架的主要缺点是没有能够充分地发挥材料的潜力，使材料有所浪费。有一次，他按照“浩氏屋架”设计一座二十公尺宽的大礼堂，发现“浩氏屋架”是根据木材抵抗能力最弱的部分来设计的，它把木材抵抗能力大（粗）的部分和抵抗能力小（细）的部分同等使用，没有充分发挥木材的应有作用，形成浪费。从这里，余传寅开始对“浩氏屋架”是否先进发生了怀疑。于是，他就想打破这种“权威”的设计，研究更先进的设计。他跑了许多图书馆，翻阅了许多土木工程的书籍，都没有找到对“浩氏屋架”不同的见解和新的计算公式。于是，他从多类屋架的设计公式进行细致而又艰苦的计算。经过一个多月夜以继日的忘我劳动，他计算出一本约等于二十万字的屋架计算的程式。从这里，他找出了轴向力变化的各类屋架计算式子的规律。经过进一步推敲，终于创造出一种计算简便、准确而又保证安全的不等节间屋架的计算公式。按照这种新公式设计的屋架，能充分地发挥木材的作用，比用“浩氏屋架”设计，平均节约木材、钢材15％以上。最近，余传寅按照他创造的不等节间屋架公式，为广州部队某单位设计了一幢十间房的汽车库。这一工程，已于7月中旬完工，经过检验，质量良好。余传寅只在中等技术学校学过半年土木工程。他的创造得到我国许多专家和建筑部门的重视和好评。
