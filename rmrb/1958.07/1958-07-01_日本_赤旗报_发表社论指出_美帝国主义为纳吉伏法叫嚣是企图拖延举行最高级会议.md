Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from Tokyo: The "Akahata," the central organ of the Japanese Communist Party, published an editorial on June 24th titled "The Execution of Nagy and American Propaganda," exposing the true purpose of the U.S. imperialists and their spokesmen in seizing the opportunity to engage in anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda by exploiting the issue of Nagy's execution.

The editorial pointed out that the execution of Nagy is Hungary's internal affair, but for the U.S. imperialists, the development of socialist construction in Hungary is intolerable, and they regard interference in Hungary's internal affairs as an important policy. The fundamental starting point of their propaganda lies here. "Akahata" pointed out: The United States is using the issue of Nagy's execution to delay holding the highest-level meeting, which has nothing to do with Hungary's internal affairs. Eisenhower once said at a press conference: "The execution of Nagy will greatly hinder the holding of the highest-level meeting." This approach will only allow people to see through the true intentions of U.S. imperialism.

"Akahata" asked: Why was Nagy executed? What role did Nagy play in the Hungarian incident? The essence of the Hungarian incident was a counter-revolutionary riot that was meticulously planned in advance, secretly armed, and openly revealed its true colors during the development of the incident. The United States allocates hundreds of millions of dollars in its annual budget to aid subversive activities within Eastern European countries. President Eisenhower said at this press conference: "The United States has played a major role in creating centrifugal forces within the Soviet bloc," referring to this matter.

The editorial said that the counter-revolutionaries in Hungary who received aid from U.S. imperialism, and the counter-revolutionaries who were openly sent into Hungary from the Austrian border during the development of the incident, massacred Hungarian security personnel, workers, and communists. Their purpose was to undermine socialism in Hungary and restore capitalism in Hungary. Their political representative, Cardinal Mindszenty, even explained this purpose through radio broadcasts. This is the essence of the Hungarian incident. Moreover, the Hungarian incident was fraught with the danger of becoming the trigger for World War III. "Radio Free Europe" encouraged that if the armed rebellion continued until after the U.S. presidential election on November 6th, the U.S. government might provide assistance. The Hungarian government, led by Nagy, decided at the ministerial meeting on November 2nd to send a government delegation led by Nagy to London and New York to request that U.S. and British imperialists send troops under the banner of the United Nations to intervene and assist them.

The editorial said that, as stated in the announcement issued by the Hungarian Ministry of Justice, Nagy was the ringleader in preparing and directing the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion. As early as the end of 1955, he organized a secret group attempting to seize power by violence. After that, the secret organization composed of Nagy and his gang systematically continued activities to weaken the worker-peasant regime. The demonstration on October 23, 1956, was launched under the leadership of the Nagy faction. Once Nagy became prime minister, he ignored the state organs stipulated by the constitution—the National Assembly, the Presidium of the People's Republic, and the government—and organized his own administrative organs. The Nagy faction also took control of the party's newspaper, promoting the situation at the time as a "national democratic movement," causing ideological confusion within the party and the working class, and disintegrating the revolutionary camp organizationally, disbanding the state security organs that were stubbornly fighting the counter-revolution. The Nagy government handed over weapons to the counter-revolutionaries, while issuing a "general order to cease fire" to the revolutionary forces fighting the counter-revolution, and organized counter-revolutionary terrorist activities in Budapest and throughout the country.

The editorial believes that Nagy and his gang played the role of subverting the Hungarian people's regime and introducing imperialist forces into Hungary. They led counter-revolutionaries to massacre many workers and leaders, and played a significant role in the counter-revolution's destruction of the Hungarian economy. They also attempted to provoke World War III. Therefore, it is natural for U.S. imperialists to shed tears over the execution of Nagy and his gang. They lost their best friends. However, the course of events clearly teaches us: it is U.S. imperialism that conspired to organize a counter-revolution in Hungary and restore capitalism; it is also U.S. imperialism that attempted to use the Hungarian incident to provoke war; and it is also U.S. imperialism that is currently attempting to use the issue of Nagy's execution to delay the holding of summit talks between major powers. Therefore, U.S. imperialism should be condemned.

### 日本“赤旗报”发表社论指出  美帝国主义为纳吉伏法叫嚣是企图拖延举行最高级会议

    日本“赤旗报”发表社论指出
    美帝国主义为纳吉伏法叫嚣是企图拖延举行最高级会议
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”在6月24日发表题为“处决纳吉和美国宣传”的社论，揭露美帝国主义者和它的代言人利用处决纳吉的问题，抓紧机会进行反苏反共宣传的真正目的。
    社论指出，处决纳吉是匈牙利的内政问题，但是对美帝国主义者说来，匈牙利社会主义建设的发展，是它所不能忍受的，而且它把干涉匈牙利的内政当做自己的重要政策，他们进行宣传的基本出发点就在这里。“赤旗报”指出：美国正利用处决纳吉的问题来拖延举行同匈牙利内政问题毫无关系的最高级会议。艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上曾经说过：“处决纳吉，将会大大妨碍举行最高级会议”。这种做法反而会使人看透美帝国主义的真正企图。
    “赤旗报”问道：纳吉为什么被处决了呢？纳吉在匈牙利事件中起了什么样的作用？匈牙利事件的本质是事先经过周密的计划、秘密地进行武装、在事件的发展过程中公然显露原形的反革命暴乱。美国每年编制几亿美元预算来援助在东欧各国内部的破坏活动。艾森豪威尔总统在这次记者招待会上说：“美国在苏联集团内部建立离心势力这一点上起了很大的作用”，就是指这件事。
    社论说，得到美帝国主义援助的匈牙利国内的反革命分子和在事件发展的过程中公开从奥地利国境被送入匈牙利的反革命分子，残杀了匈牙利的保安队员、工人和共产主义者。他们的目的是要破坏匈牙利的社会主义，并且在匈牙利恢复资本主义。他们的政治代表红衣主教明曾蒂甚至通过广播电台说明了这个目的。匈牙利事件的本质就在这里。不仅如此，匈牙利事件充分有成为第三次世界大战的导火线的危险性。“自由欧洲”广播电台鼓励说，如果武装叛乱延续到11月6日美国总统选举以后，美国政府有可能进行援助。被纳吉掌握了领导权的匈牙利政府曾经在11月2日的部长会议上决定派遣以纳吉为首席代表的政府代表团到伦敦和纽约去，要求美英帝国主义者派遣打着联合国旗帜进行干涉的军队来援助他们。
    社论说，就像匈牙利司法部发表的公告所说明的那样，纳吉是领导准备和指挥匈牙利反革命暴乱的罪魁，他早在1955年年底就组织了企图用暴力来夺取政权的秘密集团。在这以后，由纳吉和他的一伙人组成的秘密组织，有计划地继续进行了削弱工农政权的活动。1956年10月23日的示威游行就是在纳吉一派的领导下发动起来的。纳吉一担任了总理，就忽视宪法规定的国家机关——国民议会、人民共和国主席团和政府，而组织了自己的行政机构。纳吉派还掌握了党的机关报，把当时的情况宣传成“民族民主运动”，使党和工人阶级内部产生思想混乱，并且从组织上瓦解革命阵营，解散了顽强地同反革命进行斗争的国家保安机关。纳吉政府把武器交给反革命，同时向同反革命进行斗争的革命力量发出“全面停止开枪的命令”，并且在布达佩斯和全国各地组织了反革命的恐怖活动。
    社论认为，纳吉和他的一伙人起了颠覆匈牙利人民政权、把帝国主义势力引进匈牙利的作用，他们引导反革命分子残杀了很多工人和领导人，并且在反革命破坏匈牙利经济方面起了很大的作用。他们还企图挑起第三次世界大战。因此，美帝国主义者为纳吉和他的一伙人的被处决而流泪是很自然的。他们失去了最好的朋友。但是，事件的经过情况明确地教育我们：阴谋在匈牙利组织反革命、恢复资本主义的是美帝国主义；企图利用匈牙利事件来挑起战争的，也是美帝国主义；目前企图利用处决纳吉的问题来拖延举行大国最高级会谈的，也是美帝国主义。因此，美帝国主义正应该受到谴责。
