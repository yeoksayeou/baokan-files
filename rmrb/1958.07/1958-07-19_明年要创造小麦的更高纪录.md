To Create Even Higher Wheat Records Next Year

Wang Jiabing, Director of the New Atmosphere Fifth Cooperative, Gucheng County, with a Wheat Yield of 5467 Jin Per Mu

The achievement of 5467 jin of wheat per mu was jointly created by Guan Yongde (Communist Youth League member), the leader of our cooperative's first production team, and Guan Shuhua (female, Communist Youth League member). Because I was assigned to lead the production of the first team, I often studied with them on how to cultivate high-yield fields. They two cultivated a 1.5 mu experimental field, and the original target they set was 3000 jin per mu. In 1957, the average wheat yield of our cooperative was more than 300 jin per mu. When they proposed their high-yield target, which was ten times higher than the general yield, many people did not believe it and said they were talking nonsense. Old man Jiang Sanzhang sarcastically said: "I think you are pulling skin with dry legs, all talk (tendon)!"

But the harvest results greatly exceeded our bold ideals. When we went to the field, everyone exclaimed that they had never seen such unusually good wheat. The ears were densely packed and neatly arranged like a chopping board, with the longest ear tips measuring 4.2 inches. Counting the wheat grains, there were more than 120 grains, each full and shiny. The wheat grew to more than five feet tall. Shorter people were completely hidden when they went into the field. The wheat stalks were as thick as garlic shoots. Because of sufficient water and fertilizer, the leaves were still green and the branches were yellow when it was about to ripen. People standing on the edge of the field saw the wheat like a wall, with no gaps visible from left to right. It was so dense that even soil could not penetrate. A few days before harvesting, everyone took samples to calculate the number of wheat plants, counted the number of grains per ear, and calculated the weight per grain. They estimated the yield to be 4700 jin per mu, but this estimate was still lower than the actual yield.

In previous years, one person could harvest one mu of wheat in a day. But when harvesting this field, it took seven strong laborers a full day and night. More than 1300 bundles were tied from the 1.5 mu of land. During threshing, the three-mu threshing ground was completely covered. The people rolling the mill even complained that it was spread too thickly, fearing that it would not be thoroughly threshed. After threshing, the layer of wheat grains and chaff underneath was about an inch thick.

Chen Xuefan, member of the CPC Gucheng County Committee and First Secretary of the Miaotan Township Party Committee, Cai Jielun, the township secretary, and Gong Fengxian, a cadre of the County Bureau of Culture and Education, personally participated in the acceptance inspection. When weighing, representatives from each team in the cooperative participated. Men, women, old and young of the first production team all ran to watch the excitement. In the end, the 1.5 mu of land yielded a total of 8200 jin and 8 liang of wheat. In previous years, there were 17,000 grains of wheat per jin, but this year, there were only 13,000 grains of wheat per jin from this field.

The yield of more than 5000 jin per mu opened everyone's eyes. Some backward people's thinking also became clear in the face of the facts, and they all successively formulated advanced plans.

Main Cultivation Methods

The high-yield field where Communist Youth League members Guan Yongde and Guan Shuhua created the record was located on a sandbar silted up by the Han River. The silt deposited in the past four years was more than eight feet deep. The soil was black, fertile, soft, and loose. This kind of land is called "chicken manure soil" by the masses there, which is considered a high-quality land. Although the land was good, in previous years, people were not very daring to plant wheat in such land, fearing that the wheat would lodge and reduce production. People often said: "Wheat that falls yields a handful of chaff." But these two young people responded to the Party's call, were bold and courageous, and wanted to create a miracle in something that predecessors had not done.

Their main methods of cultivation were:

(1) Deep plowing and soil freezing, cross-tilling. This field was plowed twice straight and twice horizontally, and harrowed twice, with a deep plowing reaching one foot. The first plowing was not followed by harrowing, leaving the large clods suspended there to allow the July sun to thoroughly dry the cold, wet soil that was turned up from below. Half a month later, the clods were broken up and plowed a second time. This time it was horizontal plowing, six inches deep. After plowing, it was not harrowed, but still allowed to dry in the sun, increasing the soil temperature. After another half month, the clods were broken up and plowed a third time. This time, double-share plows and single-share plows were used straight, and then seven-inch plows were used to plow along the furrows, reaching a depth of seven to nine inches. In order to preserve moisture for sowing, this time plowing and harrowing were done at the same time. The fourth time was horizontal plowing with double-share plows, single-share plows, and seven-inch plows, reaching a depth of one foot, and plowing and harrowing were done at the same time. The reason for plowing more and harrowing less, and for freezing the soil more, is that the silted land was relatively humid and the soil was cold. It was necessary to dry it more, remove moisture, and increase the soil temperature. (2) Wide strip, narrow row, uniform sowing, increasing the sowing amount. This field had a 5.5-inch sowing width and a 3-inch row spacing. The sowing amount was 35.5 jin per mu, more than double the amount in previous years. To adapt to this sowing width, a special seeder was also made. This field was sown five days after the Cold Dew solar term, which was very timely and avoided the shortcomings of sowing too early or too late in the past, which affected the tillering growth of wheat seedlings. The "2419" improved variety from Nanjing University was used, which has been widely promoted in our area. (3) Layer upon layer of base fertilizer, regular application of top dressing fertilizer based on observing the seedlings. This field had eight feet of silt, containing a large amount of organic fertilizer. Last year, the corn that was planted was completely silted in the ground when it was tasseling, turning into green manure, estimated at 6000 jin per mu. Layer upon layer of base fertilizer allowed the seedlings to absorb fertilizer at every stage of growth. In early November of the lunar calendar, the wheat seedlings were a little yellow during the tillering period, so 60,000 jin of dry silt blocks from the riverbank were applied per mu. This silt is like oil mud and is very fertile. According to the masses, it also contains nitrate, which can help the development of wheat stalks and prevent lodging. In order to break up the dry mud blocks applied to the ground, an old harrow was used to harrow the ground once, which also loosened the soil. In early December of the lunar calendar, in order to prevent the wheat seedlings from being cold, 40,000 jin of silt blocks were applied per mu along the wheat rows. This was followed by harrowing once, weeding once, and loosening the roots. In early January of the lunar calendar, possibly due to the drought (there was not much snow in our area last winter), the fertilizer in the lower part was not absorbed effectively, and the seedlings were a little yellow, so 30 jin of ammonium sulfate were applied per mu. The seedlings changed quickly in a few days. At the end of January of the lunar calendar, there was a light rain, and the wheat seedlings grew rapidly. However, the leaves grew too vigorously and drooped downward. The "conservatives" in the cooperative never believed in our methods. When we wanted to apply river mud to the field, they said, "In such land, wheat will lodge even without fertilizer. If you apply more fertilizer, the wheat will roll into pieces!" Seeing that the wheat was a little yellow, they clamored, "Planting so densely, the wheat can't grow. How can it not be yellow?" When we applied fertilizer and the leaves grew too vigorously, they laughed again, "Look at the wheat growing into brush knots, it will only grow leaves and not ears in the future, a cat bites a urine bubble, happily disappointed!" Their opposition and ridicule did not affect our enthusiasm. On the contrary, sometimes listening to their words could make us more vigilant. When we heard that the wheat leaves were growing too vigorously, we thought of ways to regulate them. Ten jin of superphosphate were used per mu, and foliar application was used to spray it on the wheat seedlings. This fertilizer can help the growth of stalks. We wanted to spray it on the wheat seedlings so that we could transfer the fertilizer from the leaves to the stalks. The application of fertilizer using this method was indeed effective. In a few days, the leaves gradually hardened and rose straight up. In mid-February of the lunar calendar, when the wheat seedlings were budding, we applied another 25 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu to prevent fertilizer deficiency. The wheat seedlings grew vigorously. Later, it was discovered that the wheat leaves were still drooping due to being too fertile, so another 10 jin of superphosphate were sprayed per mu, mixed with pesticide 1605, to prevent insects and kill insects. As a result, the wheat grew very well, with deep roots, thick stalks, large ears, and full grains, and it overcame lodging. Based on the effect of the two foliar applications of chemical fertilizer, it does have a certain effect on inhibiting the vigorous growth of leaves and promoting the growth of stalks. However, the reason why it did not lodge is closely related to a series of cultivation methods such as deep plowing, fertilization, improved varieties, and dense planting.

Driving Large-Area Yield Increase

Our purpose in cultivating high-yield fields is not only to create new records on small areas of land, but also to use high yields as an example to drive low yields; to learn from the experience of small-area high-yield fields, but also to promote it universally and increase the yield of large areas. Our cooperative has constantly summarized high-yield experience and promoted its application. For example, deep plowing, cross-tilling, soil improvement, heavy fertilization, selection of improved varieties, wide-strip sowing, and other experiences have been widely applied to large-area cultivation. Before sowing, the more than 700 mu of wheat planted in our cooperative was generally plowed four times and harrowed four times, cross-tilled horizontally and vertically, and deep plowed to more than one foot. In order to improve the soil, a layer of yellow soil and sludge 1.5 feet thick was laid on more than 600 mu of sandy land. Our cooperative also carried out the "Six New" movement, digging out more than one million dan of fertile soil from the rolling roads, mill roads, cattle pens, pig pens, toilets, and houses, and applying it to the fields. Our slogan is: "If you want a rosy complexion, you must turn sandy land into black oil sand." With fertile soil and improved cultivation methods, this year's wheat is very different from previous years. In 1957, the average wheat yield of our cooperative was 360 jin per mu. This year, we planted a total of 703 mu, 4 fen, and 8 li of wheat, with an average yield of 1017 jin per mu. High-yield has become not rare in our cooperative. There are 15 mu and 1 fen with a yield of more than 2000 jin per mu, 7 mu and 2 fen with a yield of more than 3000 jin per mu, 2 mu and 4 fen with a yield of more than 4000 jin per mu, and 2 mu, 5 fen, and 5 li with a yield of more than 5000 jin per mu.

This year's high-yield experience tells us that the land has unlimited production potential. We will further learn from the treasure house of China's 5,000 years of agricultural production experience, and learn from advanced agricultural science and technology around the world. The high-yield per mu target we have set for wheat in 1959 will be several times higher than 5,000 jin, and the per mu target for large areas of wheat in our entire cooperative will also greatly exceed 5,000 jin. Next year, we will report the good news to the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country with even higher achievements! (Attached picture)

    明年要创造小麦的更高纪录
    亩产小麦5467斤的谷城县新气象五社社主任　王家炳
    亩产小麦五千四百六十七斤的成绩，是我社第一生产队队长关永德（共青团员）和社员关树华（女、共青团员）共同创造的。我因为分工负责领导一队的生产，也经常同他们一起研究如何种丰产田。他们两人种了一块一亩五分的试验田，原来提的指标是亩产三千斤。我们社的小麦在1957年一般亩产三百多斤，当他们提出自己的丰产指标十倍于一般产量的时候，许多人不相信，说他们是瞎吹。蒋三章老汉讽刺说：“我看你们是干腿抓拉皮，光是斤（筋）了！”
    可是收获的结果呢，却大大超过了我们大胆的理想。走到地里，人人都吵着没见过这么出奇的好麦子。那穗子长的密咋咋、齐唰唰的像案板一样，穗子顶长的有四寸二分，数数麦粒有一百二十多粒，粒粒饱满光亮。麦子长有五尺来高，矮一点的人，钻进去头都给埋住了。麦秆子真像蒜苔那么粗。因为水足粪肥，临成熟的时候，还是叶绿枝黄。人们站在地边上，麦子好像一堵墙，左看右看不露缝儿，真是密的撒土不漏。在收割前几天，大家抽方计算了麦棵，按穗计算了粒数，按粒算了斤数，估到亩产四千七百斤，但估得还是落后了。
    往年割麦子，一个人一天能割一亩。但割这块麦的时候，七个壮劳力，整整割了一天一夜。一亩半地，扎了一千三百多捆。打场的时候，把一块三亩大的场园铺得满满的，碾场的人还嫌铺的过厚，怕碾不透。碾过之后，底下的麦粒连糠有寸把厚。
    中共谷城县县委委员、庙滩乡党委第一书记陈学范、乡秘书蔡杰伦、县文教局干部龚奉先，都亲自参加了验收。过秤的时候，全社各队都派代表参加。第一生产队的男女老少都跑来看热闹。最后，一亩五分地共收小麦八千二百斤零八两。往年的小麦一斤有一万七千粒，今年这块地的小麦一万三千粒就有一斤。
    亩产五千多斤给大家开了眼界，一些落后的人思想在事实面前也通了窍，都纷纷订出了先进的规划。
    主要的耕作方法
    共青团员关永德和关树华创造高产纪录的丰产田，在汉水边一个河套淤起来的沙洲上。近四年淤起的淤泥有八尺多深，土是乌黑色，土质肥沃，柔软疏松，这种地在我们那里群众称为“鸡屎土”的上好地。土地虽好，但往年人们却不太敢在这样的地里种小麦，怕种了小麦要倒伏减产。人常说：麦倒一把糠。但是这两个青年人响应党的号召，大胆勇为，要在前人没有作过的事上创奇迹。
    他们在耕作上的主要办法是：
    （一）深耕炕垡，交叉整地。这块地直犁二次，横犁二次，耙二次，深耕达到一尺。头次犁后没有耙，大垡子悬在那里，好让7月的太阳晒透底下翻上来的发冷的湿土。半月后把垡子打碎，犁第二次。这次是横犁，深达六寸，犁后没耙，还是让太阳晒垡子，增加地温。又过了半个月，才打垡子，犁第三次。这次是先后用双铧犁，单铧犁直着犁，又用七寸步犁顺沟套犁，深达八、九寸。为了保墒播种，这次是随犁随耙。第四次是横着先后用双铧犁、单铧犁、七寸步犁套犁，深达一尺，随犁随耙。所以这样多犁少耙，多炕垡，是因为这块淤泥地湿度较大，地气寒，要多晒晒，去湿气，增加地温。（二）宽幅窄行匀播，增加播种量。这块地是五点五寸播幅，三寸行距，每亩播种量三十五斤半，较往年增加一倍多。为适应这种播幅，还特制了一种播种器。这块地在寒露后五天播种，很适时，避免了过去播种过早或过晚，影响麦苗分蘖生长的缺点。用的是南大“二四一九”良种，这种麦子在我们那里已经普遍推广。（三）层层有底肥，定期看苗施追肥。这块地有八尺深的淤泥，含有大量的有机肥料。去年，种的玉米正在抽顶挂胡时，又全部被淤在地里，变成绿肥，估计每亩有六千斤。层层有了底肥，这就使青苗在各个生长阶段上都能吸收到肥料。农历11月初，麦苗在分蘖时期，看到有点发黄，就每亩施了六万斤河边的干淤泥块。这种淤泥像油泥一样，很肥，据群众说里边还含有硝气，可以帮助麦秆的发育，防止倒伏。为着把施在地里的干泥块破碎，用旧耙在地里耙了一次，也疏松了土壤。农历腊月初，为着防止麦苗受寒，又顺麦行子每亩施了四万斤淤泥块。随着又耙了一次，锄了一遍草，松了一下根。农历正月初，可能是天旱的原因（去冬我们那里没有下什么雪），下部的肥料没有吃上劲，苗子有些发黄，就每亩施了三十斤硫酸铵，不几天苗子就变过来了。正月底下了一场小雨，麦苗大长起来，可是叶子长得过旺，都沉得往下搭拉了。社里的“保守派”始终不相信我们的作法。我们要在地里施河泥，他们说：“这样的地，不施肥麦子都要倒伏，再施肥，麦子都要滚成片片呀！”见麦子有些发黄了，他们就嚷嚷：“种那么密，麦子长不起来，能不黄？”我们施了肥，叶长得过旺了，他们又笑：“看那麦子长成了刷子疙瘩，将来光长叶子不长穗，猫咬尿泡瞎喜欢！”他们的反对和嘲笑并不能影响我们的干劲，相反的，有时听听他们的话，还可以使我们提高警惕。我们听到说麦叶长的过旺了，就想办法调治，每亩用十斤过磷酸钙，采取根外施肥的办法，把它喷洒在麦苗上。这种肥料可以帮助秆茎的生长，我们想把它喷在麦苗上，就可以把叶子上的肥力追赶到秆子上去。用这办法施肥，果然生了效力，不几天，叶子就渐渐发硬直升起来了。农历2月中旬，正是麦苗含苞的时候，我们为了怕脱肥，每亩又施了硫酸铵二十五斤，麦苗一个劲长起来了。后来又发现麦叶有些过肥下搭，就又每亩喷洒了十斤过磷酸钙，并混合了农药1605，防虫杀虫。结果，麦子长得很好，根深，秆粗，穗大，粒饱，并战胜了倒伏。根据两次根外追施化肥的效果来看，确实对制止叶子猛长过肥和促使秆茎生长有一定作用，但所以未倒伏，和深耕、施肥、良种、密植等一系列的耕作方法都有密切关系。
    带动了大面积增产
    我们种高额丰产田，并非只是为了在小面积的土地上创新纪录，而是为了以高产作样子，带动低产；从小面积的丰产田吸取经验，而是为了普遍推广，提高大面积的产量。我们社里曾不断总结丰产经验，推广运用。例如深耕、交叉整地、改良土壤、多施肥、精选良种、宽幅条播等等经验，已普遍应用在大面积耕作上。我们社种的七百多亩小麦，在播种前，普遍作到四犁四耙，横竖交叉整地，深耕达一尺以上。为了改良土壤，曾在六百多亩的沙土地里铺上了一尺五寸厚的黄土和污泥。我们社里还开展了“六新”运动，把碾道、磨道、牛圈、猪圈、厕所、住房的肥土挖出一百多万担，上到地里。我们的口号是：想得人面桃花，就要把沙土地变成黑油沙。有了肥沃的土壤，再加耕作方法的改进，今年的小麦就和往年大不相同了。1957年，我们社的小麦平均亩产三百六十斤，今年我们共种小麦七百零三亩四分八厘，平均亩产一千零十七斤。高额丰产，在我社已不是少有的奇事，亩产二千斤以上的有十五亩一分，亩产三千斤以上的有七亩二分，亩产四千斤以上的有二亩四分，亩产五千斤以上的有二亩五分五。
    今年的丰产经验告诉我们，土地还有无限的生产潜力，我们将进一步向我国五千年农业生产经验的宝库中学习，向全世界先进的农业科学技术学习。我们所预定的1959年小麦高额亩产指标，将数倍于五千斤，我们全社小麦大面积的亩产指标，也要大大超过五千斤。明年，我们将以更高的成绩，向共产党、毛主席和全国人民报喜！（附图片）
