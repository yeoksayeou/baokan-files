All-Purpose Pig Farm
By our reporters Sun Yuedong and Liu Zongtang

Recently, with curiosity, the reporters visited a newly established "All-Purpose Pig Farm" in Guanghua Agricultural Cooperative, Jinzi Township, Zizhong County, Sichuan.

Everything in this pig farm gives a fresh impression. The farm has swimming pools, feeding areas, medical stations, treatment facilities, and special areas for raising piglets, resembling a complete combined factory. The farm raises over one hundred sows and fifty piglets, who receive meticulous care. Since its establishment, the farm has supplied the cooperative with a large number of excellent piglets.

Like all visitors, we are infinitely impressed by the various innovations of this pig farm. In this era of the Great Leap Forward, all kinds of miracles can happen, and even an ordinary task like pig farming can have so many innovations.

A Paradise for Piglets

As soon as we entered the pig farm, we saw a group of piglets in the shed, each with shiny and smooth fur. Although it was a hot and sunny day outside, it was cool and comfortable here.

Liu Yunzhou, the head of the pig farm, told us that the piglets sent here for rearing must first be乳猪 piglets aged seven to twenty days, and secondly, those from sows with excessive litters and weaker piglets. Liu Yunzhou pointed to a group of spotted piglets and said, "This litter has nineteen piglets, but the sow only has twelve teats; in the past, this often resulted in piglets not getting enough to eat, becoming weak, or even dying." But now, the caretakers regularly take some of the piglets to sows with smaller litters for feeding, ensuring that each piglet gets enough milk. For piglets that cannot find a suitable sow to nurse, the piglet rearing area uses milk, soy milk, etc. for artificial feeding. Due to the implementation of separating mothers and offspring, accidents of piglets being crushed or trampled have been eliminated, and the survival rate is 100%. Moreover, sows that produce more piglets can get adequate rest; coupled with reduced and fixed feeding times, the estrus period of sows is advanced, which can also change the situation of producing two litters a year to five litters in two years.

Upon hearing the caretaker's call, a group of piglets ran over. It was time to feed the piglets. At the entrance of the feeding area, a clear water pool blocked the road, and the piglets walked through the pool in an orderly manner. After going back and forth twice, the piglets' hooves were washed clean.

The piglets eat in an interesting way. On a specially made small wooden trough, each piglet occupies a grid, just enough to accommodate a piglet's mouth, without any contention. In the past, piglets would eat around a clay pot, often fighting, with the stronger ones eating too much and the weaker ones often going hungry; moreover, piglets often put their muddy front hooves into the pot, and many piglets suffered from unclean food, affecting their normal development. Now, these phenomena have disappeared.

When we entered the medical station, caretaker Li Xianghua was injecting medicine into two piglets. These two sick piglets were sent by the neighboring Jiaotong Agricultural Cooperative for treatment. This station is equipped with various needles and medicines. When sick pigs are discovered on the farm or by nearby farmers, they are sent here for diagnosis and treatment. Those requiring long-term treatment are kept here, which is convenient for care and also ensures isolation to avoid disease transmission.

Inside the sow pen, everything was clean and tidy, without a single fly. This is the cooperative's "pigpen epidemic prevention and hygiene experimental field."

There is more than just this type of experimental field. At the top of one pigpen, a sign hung: "Sow High-Yield Experimental Field." A strong sow with a big belly was sound asleep in the pen. This is the creative experiment being carried out by the pig farmers. They are using advanced double-mating and continuous-mating methods to make this sow produce thirty piglets in one litter, and ensure that each one survives and is healthy. They plan to summarize the experience of improving the sow's litter size through this experiment, so as to massively breed pigs in the entire cooperative, striving to increase the number of pigs in the whole cooperative from an average of more than three per household to fifteen this year.

All-Purpose Pig Farmers

All the equipment in this pig farm was repaired by the caretakers themselves, without spending a penny. There are seven caretakers in this farm, five of whom are young girls aged seventeen to twenty. Not long ago, they were novices who had never raised pigs, but now they are called "all-purpose pig farmers" by the cooperative members, and they can do everything from mating, delivering, medical treatment to feeding management.

We saw these pig farmers give pigs baths in the hot sun, cook feed, and clean pigpens, being extremely busy; but they were all full of energy, as if they never knew fatigue. They said that this place used to be a stinky and dirty pigsty, but in their hands, it was completely transformed in just three days. The entire farm was built while raising pigs, and the speed reached an astonishing level. For example, one night, someone suggested building a pig swimming pool. As soon as the words were spoken, they immediately went six miles away to haul coal slag and transport lime, working all night, and the swimming pool was built the next morning. They had never raised pigs before, so they went to experienced farmers to humbly ask for advice and carefully observed how others fed pigs. They were busy during the day, so they took time in the evening to ask cadres to lecture on animal husbandry and veterinary knowledge. Some even fell asleep with books in their hands. After visiting various places, they began to learn how to hammer stones, preparing to build even better pig houses with their own hands in the future.

Many farmers originally did not believe that these young people could raise pigs well, but now they are all sincerely convinced. Now, nearby agricultural cooperatives are learning from this experience and preparing to establish such pig farms. (Picture attached)

    万能养猪场
    本报记者　孙跃冬　刘宗棠
    最近，记者怀着好奇的心情，到四川资中县金紫乡光华农业社参观新创办的一所“万能养猪场”。
    这个养猪场的一切给人一种新鲜的印象。场内设有猪只的浴池、食场、医疗站、治疗院和专养小猪的场，很像一座完备的联合工厂。场里饲养着一百多头母猪和五十多头小猪，它们受到无微不至的照顾。这个场从建立以来，为社里输送了大量优良的小猪。
    像所有参观者一样，对这个养猪场的种种创造，我们感到无限钦佩。在这大跃进的时代，什么样的奇迹都会出现，连养猪这样一件平凡的工作，竟也能有这么多的革新创造。
    小猪的乐园
    一走进猪场，我们就看见草棚里的一群小猪个个长得油光水滑，虽然室外是炎热的大太阳，这里却阴凉舒适。
    养猪场场长刘运周告诉我们，送到这里饲养的小猪，首先必须是生下七天到二十天的乳猪，其次是母猪产仔过多的和较瘦弱的小猪。刘运周指着一群花小猪说：“这窝小猪是十九头，可是母猪只有十二个奶头；过去像这种情况，就常发生小猪吃不饱，体质瘦弱或死亡现象。”可是现在，饲养员按时抱一部分小猪到产仔较少的母猪身边喂奶，使每个小猪都有足够的奶吃。找不到适当母猪喂奶的乳猪，小猪饲养场就用牛奶、豆浆等实行人工授乳。由于实行了母仔分居，小猪被压死、踏伤的事故没有了，成活率都是百分之百。而生产猪仔多的母猪，也可得到适当休息；再加上喂奶次数减少和时间固定，母猪发情期提前，还可以改变一年产仔两窝的状况为两年产五窝。
    听见饲养员呼唤，一群小猪便跑来。这是到了喂小猪饲料的时候。饲料场地门口有一个清水池拦住道路，小猪井然有序地从水池中走过。这样来回两趟，就把小猪的四蹄冲洗得干干净净。
    小猪吃食也很有趣。在一张特制的小木槽上，每头各占一格，恰好容得下一张小猪咀吧，互不争夺。以前，小猪围着一个瓦钵吃，经常打架，强的吃得过多而弱的往往饿肚皮；而且小猪常常将带污泥的前蹄伸进钵内，许多小猪吃了不洁食物便影响正常发育。现在，这些现象都没有了。
    当我们走进医疗站时，看护员黎香华正在给两头小猪注射针药。这两头有病的小猪是邻近的交通农业社送来医治的。这个站备有各种针药，场里或附近农民发现了病猪，就送到这里来诊治，需要长期治疗的就留在这里，这样护理方便，又可作好隔离，避免疾病传染。
    走进母猪圈里，上下四周都干干净净，一个苍蝇也没有。原来这是全社的“猪圈防疫卫生试验田”。
    试验田还不止这一种。在一格猪圈的顶上，挂着一个牌子：“母猪高产试验田”。圈里一头健壮的母猪鼓着大肚皮正在酣睡。这就是养猪手们正在进行的创造性试验。他们采用先进的双重配种和连续配种等方法，要这头母猪一窝产仔三十头，而且个个成活健壮。她们准备通过这次试验，总结出提高母猪产仔率的经验，以便在全社大量繁殖猪只，争取今年全社猪只由平均每户三头多增加到十五头。
      万能养猪手
    这个养猪场的全套设备都是饲养员们自己动手修的，并不曾花一文钱。这个场有七名饲养员，其中有五个是十七岁到二十岁的年轻姑娘。她们在不久前还是从未养过猪的生手，可是现在被社员称为“万能养猪手”，从配种、接生、医疗到饲养管理，样样都会。
    我们看到这些养猪手一时在烈日下给猪洗澡，一时又煮饲料喂猪，打扫猪圈，忙得不可开交；可是她们个个精神饱满，好像从不知道疲倦。她们说，这里原来仅是一所又臭又脏的猪圈，但在她们的手下，仅三天就改变得面目全非。整个场是边养边建的，那速度达到惊人的程度。例如有一天晚上，有人建议修个猪浴池，话刚落地，他们就立即到六里以外去拉炭渣、运石灰，整整干了一夜，第二天早晨浴池就修好了。她们没有养过猪，就去找有经验的农民虚心请教，细心观察别人怎样喂法。白天忙，就夜晚抽时间请干部来讲授畜牧兽医知识。有的睡着了还掌着书本。她们到各地参观回来以后，就开始学习打石头，准备将来用自己的手建造更美好的猪舍。
    许多农民原来不相信这些年青人会把猪养好，这一下都心悦诚服了。现在，附近农业社都学习这个经验，准备建立这样的养猪场。（附图片）
