    Intercepting Floods and Benefiting in the Same Year
    Completion of the Huairou Reservoir
    Xinhua News Agency Report The Huairou Reservoir has been completed. Between Longshan Mountain and Shichang Mountain, north of Huairou County, the 1,100-meter-long flood control dam spanning the Huai River, a tributary of the Chaobai River, has stopped the torrents from the upper reaches of the Huai River in recent days. The rushing mountain floods coming from both sides of the Great Wall along the Huai River since the end of June have been tamed and confined within the reservoir area.

    The four characters "Huairou Reservoir," written by Premier Zhou, are inlaid with white marble on the outer slope of the flood control dam and can be seen from a great distance.

    Since the water storage began, no water seepage has been detected at the junction of the dam and the mountains, nor in the seepage ditches. The water diversion tunnel was opened on July 11th, and the results are good. The spillway and other finishing work are still underway for the entire project.

    This reservoir, capable of storing 100 million cubic meters of water, is the second newly built reservoir near Beijing. It was built by the masses of farmers, under the leadership of the Party, mainly using their own strength and their own tools during the high tide of the Great Leap Forward. The main force in the construction of this reservoir was 60,000 laborers, who came from 3,477 agricultural production cooperatives in Huairou, Xianghe, Gu'an, Sanhe counties of Hebei Province, and Tongzhou, Shunyi districts of Beijing.

    The Huairou Reservoir is one of the many reservoirs to be built in the Hai River basin management plan. Originally planned to be built in a few years, this spring, inspired by the Great Leap Forward and the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir in the capital, the nearby farmers requested its construction to be advanced. Construction started in mid-March, with simultaneous surveying and construction. The 60,000 farmers worked in one go and completed it in just four months.

    The completion and water storage of the Huairou Reservoir has already played a role in reducing the peak flow of the Chaobai River during the current flood season, reducing flood disasters on both sides of the Huai River. The water from this reservoir can also irrigate approximately one million mu of farmland. In the future, the water from this reservoir will also be one of the sources for the Beijing-Tianjin Canal.

    For the 3,477 agricultural cooperatives, the construction of the Huairou Reservoir means that some will benefit from irrigation, some can reduce flood disasters, and some can reduce the burden of flood control. However, most agricultural cooperatives do not benefit. Regardless of whether they benefit or not, the 60,000 farmers all brought their own tools and actively signed up to participate in this great socialist construction. Inspired by the spirit of communist cooperation, whether benefiting or not, they all believed that this was labor for their own construction. The reservoir is their own, and their labor is recorded by their own agricultural cooperatives.

    Due to the short time and the large scale of the project, some people doubted whether it could be completed before the flood season. The 60,000 farmers answered this doubt with soaring enthusiasm. They put forward slogans such as "Fight hard for a few months, build a large reservoir" and "Complete before the flood season, benefit in the same year," launching a competition to race against the flood during construction. During the Red May and the most tense period before the flood season, they created a high record of transporting 32,000 cubic meters of earth to the dam by human power per day.

    Because the design was being revised while construction was underway, difficulties were encountered during construction, and there were some struggles. But all difficulties were overcome by the strength of the masses.

    During the construction, technicians and students from Beijing Municipality and some officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army supported the farmers with technology and labor. Since the construction of this reservoir was mainly undertaken by the people with government assistance, the state investment was only 3.5 million yuan.

### 拦蓄洪水  当年受益  怀柔水库建成

    拦蓄洪水  当年受益
    怀柔水库建成
    新华社讯  怀柔水库已经建成。在怀柔县城北的龙山和石厂山之间，横跨潮白河支流怀河的全长一千一百公尺的拦洪大坝，已经把近几天来怀河上游来的滚滚洪流阻遏住了。6月底以来从长城内外沿怀河来的奔腾的山洪，已被驯服地关在水库区内。
    周总理写的“怀柔水库”四个大字，用汉白玉嵌在拦洪大坝的外坡上，很远的地方就可以看到。
    蓄水以来，大坝与两山接头处和渗水沟，都没有发现透水的现象。输水隧洞已经在7月11日提闸放水，效果良好。整个工程中，还有溢洪道等剩些尾工。
    这座能蓄水一亿公方的水库，是北京附近新建成的第二座水库。它是在大跃进的高潮中，农民群众在党的领导下，主要用自己的力量和自己的工具修成的。这个水库施工的主要力量是六万民工，他们来自河北省怀柔、香河、固安、三河等县和北京市通州、顺义等区的三千四百七十七个农业生产合作社。
    怀柔水库是根治海河流域规划中要修的许多水库之一。原计划几年后才修，今年春天附近农民在大跃进的鼓舞下，在首都修建十三陵水库的鼓舞下，要求提前兴修的。3月中旬才一面勘测一面开工，六万农民一鼓作气，短短四个月就建成了。
    怀柔水库的建成和蓄水，在当前的洪水期中，已经起了降低潮白河洪峰的作用，减免了怀河两岸的洪水灾害。这个水库的水还可灌溉约一百万亩农田。将来，这个水库的水还是京津运河的水源之一。
    对三千四百七十七个农业社来说，怀柔水库的建成，它们有的受到灌溉的利益，有的可以减免洪水灾害，有的可以减轻一些防汛的负担。但是大部分农业社并不受益。不管受益与否，六万农民都是自带工具、积极主动报名要求参加这项伟大的社会主义建设的。在共产主义的协作精神鼓舞下，不论受益或不受益，他们都认为这是为自己的建设而劳动。水库是他们自己的，他们的劳动也由自己的农业社记工。
    由于时间短促，工程浩大，有人曾怀疑汛前能否修成。六万农民用冲天的干劲回答了这个怀疑。他们提出“苦战几个月，修成大水库”、“汛前完成，当年受益”等口号，施工中展开和洪水赛跑的竞赛运动。在红五月、在汛前最紧张的时候，创造了人力运土上坝每天三万二千公方的高纪录。
    由于是一面施工一面修订设计，因而施工中遇到困难，也有过一些斗争。但是所有困难都由群众力量克服了。
    施工中，北京市的技术人员和学生、一部分人民解放军的指战员在技术和劳力上支援了农民。由于这个水库的修建主要是民办公助，国家投资仅三百五十万元。
