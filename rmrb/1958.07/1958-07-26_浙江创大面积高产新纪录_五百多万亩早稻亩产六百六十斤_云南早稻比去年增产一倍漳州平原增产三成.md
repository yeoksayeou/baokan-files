Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 24th: Zhejiang Province planted over 15.4 million mu of early rice this year. As of the 22nd, over 5.7 million mu had been harvested, yielding 3.76 billion jin of dried grain, an average yield of 660 jin per mu. Last year, the province's 11,829,000 mu of early rice only yielded 3.797 billion jin, with an average yield of only 321 jin per mu.

New high-yield records on small areas with yields exceeding 3,000 jin per mu continue to emerge. On the 15th, the 2.2 mu experimental plot of the Qiaoshang Agricultural Cooperative in Xinfeng Township, Zhuji County, set a new provincial record for early rice yield of 3,018.6 jin per mu. The next day, the tenth team of the Youhao Agricultural Cooperative in the same township harvested 4,078 jin of grain from a 1.073 mu experimental plot, averaging 3,800.8 jin per mu. By the 17th, a 1.51 mu high-yield experimental plot of the Xinluo Agricultural Cooperative in Xinfeng Township harvested 6,161.75 jin of dry grain, averaging 4,080.5 jin per mu.

This newspaper reports: Yunnan Province's 470,000 mu of early rice achieved large-scale high yields. According to the yields calculated from the main producing areas that have already completed harvesting, the average yield per mu is 500 jin, doubling the unit area yield of last year.

Last year, Yunnan Province only planted 100,000 mu of early rice. In the past, the highest yield of early rice in the province was 1,300 jin per mu. This year, Qian'gang Township in Pu'er County set a record of 2,740 jin per mu. The average yield per mu of the 200,000 mu of early rice in the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture is over 800 jin.

This year's early rice was planted during the worst drought in the past two or three decades. Thanks to the water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, and the resolute and tenacious drought resistance efforts of farmers of all ethnic groups, the early rice was generally planted about a month earlier than in previous years, ensuring a good harvest of early rice and the seasonal planting of late rice.

This newspaper reports: The Zhangzhou Plain, in the lower reaches of the Jiulong River in southern Fujian, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice. According to the latest statistics from the recently concluded harvest, the average yield per mu reached 730 jin, an increase of more than 30% over last year. Among them, more than 11,000 mu yielded over 1,000 jin. All 136 agricultural cooperatives in the entire plain have achieved increased production.

    浙江创大面积高产新纪录
    五百多万亩早稻亩产六百六十斤
    云南早稻比去年增产一倍漳州平原增产三成
    据新华社杭州24日电　浙江省今年栽种的一千五百四十多万亩早稻，到22日已收割了五百七十多万亩，收获的干谷有三十七亿六千万斤，平均每亩产量高达六百六十斤。而去年全省早稻一千一百八十二万九千亩，才收三十七亿九千七百万斤，平均亩产只达三百二十一斤。
    亩产量三千斤以上的小面积高产新纪录不断出现。诸暨县新枫乡桥上农业社的二亩二分试验田，在15日首开全省早稻亩产三千零一十八点六斤的纪录；第二天该乡友好农业社的第十小队的一亩零七厘三试验田，共收谷子四千零七十八斤，平均亩产三千八百斤八两；到17日新枫乡新骆农业社有一丘一点五一亩高产试验田，共收干谷六千一百六十一斤十二两，平均亩产四千零八十斤十两。
    本报讯　云南省四十七万亩早稻获得大面积丰产。据主要产区已经收完的产量计算，平均亩产五百斤，比去年单位面积产量增加一倍。
    云南全省去年只种早稻十万亩，过去全省早稻最高亩产量是一千三百斤，今年普洱县谦岗乡创造了亩产二千七百四十斤的纪录。红河哈尼族彝族自治州二十万亩早稻平均亩产在八百斤以上。
    今年早稻是在二、三十年来特大的干旱中栽种的，由于去冬今春的水利建设和各族农民坚决顽强地抗旱，早稻普遍比往年提早一个月左右栽下，保证了早稻丰收和晚稻的按季节栽插。
    本报讯　福建南部九龙江下游的漳州平原早稻空前大丰收。据最近刚刚收刈结束的统计：平均每亩产量达七百三十斤，比去年增产三成以上。其中千斤以上的有一万一千多亩。整个平原的一百三十六个农业社已实现了社社增产。　（中共龙溪地委办公室）
