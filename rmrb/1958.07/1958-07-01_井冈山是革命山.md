    Jinggang Mountain is a Revolutionary Mountain
    Thirty years ago, Jinggang Mountain,
    A red flag soared into the sky.
    The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army made revolution,
    Overthrew the landlords and divided the land,
    To protect the people's country.
    Thirty years later, Jinggang Mountain,
    A large army of cadres enters the mountains,
    To transform the poor mountains and harsh waters,
    Planting Chinese pistache and green tea,
    Opening terraced fields in the misty mountains.
    A vast army of industry,
    Running through the thirteen counties below the mountain,
    The "Iron Ox" of that year leaped from the earth,
    Mineral deposits are revealed in every county,
    Four thousand iron factories refine iron.
    Jinggang Mountain is a revolutionary mountain,
    Its revolutionary will is firm,
    In those days, pumpkin and rice for the Red Army,
    Now treasures are contributed everywhere,
    Taking out fifty billion (tons) of steel,
    Even Britain would be dumbfounded!

    井冈山是革命山	文莽彦
    三十年前井冈山，
    一杆红旗冲九天，
    工农红军闹革命，
    打倒豪绅又分田，
    要保人民坐江山。
    三十年后井冈山，
    干部大军进深山，
    要改穷山和恶水，
    黄桐绿茶种上天，
    云山雾海开梯田。
    工业大军万万千，
    跑遍山下十三县，
    当年铁牛跃出土，
    县县矿苗都露面，
    四千个铁厂把铁炼。
    井冈山是革命山，
    它为革命意志坚，
    当年南瓜大米为红军，
    如今遍地财宝都贡献，
    拿出钢铁五十亿（吨），
    英国见了也傻眼！
