Refuting Various "Waste" Theories
Liu Bingchen, Student of the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics, Peking University

The Party's policy of education serving politics, combining education with labor, and cultivating communist laborers with culture, can be said to have truly grasped the essence of proletarian education that distinguishes it from bourgeois education. Those who are deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology have exhausted their minds to come up with various arguments to resist and negate this policy. Among these arguments, the primary one is the "waste" theory.

Some people say: "After five years of cultivation in university, having learned a lot of professional theory, to go and be an ordinary worker or farmer, only engaged in simple labor, isn't this a waste?" Some say: "The main task of a lathe worker is production, they don't have any mathematical or mechanical problems that need to be solved, but our students in the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics specialize in solving mathematical and mechanical problems. Going to be a lathe worker only means repeating certain production processes. What is learned is not consistent with what is used. Isn't this a waste?" Others say: "The country needs mathematics and mechanics workers very much. Since mathematics and mechanics workers are also ordinary laborers, why must they go and be ordinary workers and farmers?"

From these erroneous arguments, it can first be seen that ordinary workers and farmers are simple in the eyes of these people, only able to repeatedly perform some simple operations. They look down on workers and farmers and their labor. The facts are just the opposite. The communist ordinary laborer is a noble title. This is not only because they create the social material wealth, but also because their labor itself is the most creative. Under the current situation of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland, countless miracles have emerged. Most of these miracles were not created by intellectuals and experts who understand so-called professional theories, but by ordinary workers and farmers. The yield of wheat reaching more than 7,000 catties per mu, and the successful distant hybridization of sorghum and rice are both world firsts. Things that experts dare not even imagine have been created by farmers. Can it be said that farmers are simple? Three or four workers in a small factory behind the Beijing Planetarium made a planetarium projector; ordinary workers and technicians made reactive dyes and high-grade polishing powder; Cai Zuquan, an ordinary worker at Fudan University, became a high-vacuum expert. From the above examples, we can completely say that only ordinary laborers engaged in actual production are the most creative, the most knowledgeable, and the most remarkable people. These are precisely the glorious images of communist ordinary laborers. Being such an ordinary laborer is an incomparable honor, how can it be said to be a waste of one's talents?!

If one studies mathematics and mechanics and then becomes a worker or farmer, does this mean that what is learned is inconsistent with what is used? Here, we must first ask: Don't ordinary workers and farmers need to understand mathematics and mechanics? The July 13th newspaper reported that ordinary workers in Chengdu, without experts or engineers, relied on their own experience and knowledge to make a glider with good performance. Manufacturing gliders requires mathematical and mechanical knowledge. This example shows that under the current situation of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland, there are a large number of mathematical and mechanical problems in various departments waiting to be solved. For example, the current wheat yield is 7,000 catties per mu, and the wheat stalks are so dense that even mice cannot enter. Next year, the yield will be further increased, and there will be no "standing room" in the field. People cannot enter, so they have to carry out high-altitude operations. To carry out high-altitude operations, there are mathematical and mechanical problems that need to be solved. In short, there are very many mathematical and mechanical problems raised in practice, and they involve a large number of the latest departments in mathematics and mechanics. If these problems are solved, they can save a lot of funds and labor for the country, and greatly promote our country's socialist construction. There is no problem of inconsistency between what is learned and what is used here. The problem lies in whether we are determined to hand over knowledge to the people. If one learns some book knowledge but is unwilling to solve practical production problems, this is the greatest inconsistency between what is learned and what is used, and it is the greatest waste.

From another point of view, are those intellectuals and so-called "talents" who have learned professional theories really that brilliant? No, they are not. Facts have proved that intellectuals who are divorced from labor and do not understand production practice are the most incompetent. These people are at a loss when they encounter practical problems and often make jokes.

A well-known electrical expert at Tsinghua University designed a small motor with a designed speed of 2,000 revolutions per minute. After it was made, it only reached 1,500 revolutions per minute, and it could not reach the designed speed no matter what.

At the same time, being divorced from production practice and physical labor will inevitably lead to a metaphysical way of thinking ideologically, and will inevitably lead to a deformed path in business, making it impossible to solve practical problems. More importantly, he will never have common feelings with the working people. So even if he has some theoretical knowledge, he will not be able to do work that is beneficial to the people and socialist construction. Let's look at an example! A student named Hong in class 31 of the Department of Mathematics, was always considered a "genius" by his classmates. He had written several papers, one of which was published in the "Mathematics Bulletin." What was this genius really like? His world outlook was idealistic. He believed that mathematics itself is an abstract way of thinking, so learning mathematics should cultivate inspiration, the more abstract the better, the more bizarre the better, and he exercised himself in terms of wild thoughts. Under the guidance of this thought and interest, his "papers" were all boring things like mathematical games. This erroneous and deformed path made him more and more empty as he pursued it. He himself wrote, "Originally, everything is meaningless, and nothing is worth pursuing." From the development path of this "genius," we can clearly see that if we do not link with reality and do not thoroughly transform our spiritual outlook, the so-called genius is a complete waste to the people.

From this, it can be seen that if the people cultivated are all like this, not diligent in their limbs, unable to distinguish the five grains, divorced from physical labor, do not understand production practice, only have some book knowledge, plus an inexplicable sense of superiority, look down on the working people, and cannot solve practical problems - this is the greatest waste for the country and the people.

Thinking that the country needs mathematics and mechanics workers, and that only engaging in mathematics and mechanics research is the most beneficial to the country, and seeing the development of science as the business of a few people, as something that can be accomplished by sitting in a research institute, divorced from production practice and the broad masses of the people, is precisely the capitalist view and road of developing science. Only by first becoming an ordinary laborer, letting professional knowledge take root in production practice, being both a mathematics and mechanics worker and an ordinary laborer in production; being both a mental laborer and a physical laborer. Those who stubbornly control scientific research in the hands of a few people as "patents" and want to stand above the working people and point fingers can only hinder the development of science.

In summary, going to be an ordinary laborer after graduating from university is not a waste. People who hold the waste theory only show that they despise labor, despise the working people, and cannot let go of the stinking airs of intellectuals.

Why are some people unwilling to be ordinary laborers? This is not accidental. This is because the bourgeois exploitationist viewpoint of despising physical labor and the working people is still firmly rooted in the minds of some people. If, after criticizing individualism, some people still attempt to maintain their special position of standing above the working people in the future by means of private ownership of knowledge, "the people cannot do without us intellectuals," then now the proposal to be an ordinary laborer, to be an ordinary worker or farmer, will completely shatter the dream of private ownership of knowledge. Naturally, this will inevitably arouse resistance, resistance, and opposition. This is the reason why many people, more or less, resist being an ordinary laborer with different faces and arguments. The debate about being an ordinary laborer essentially reflects the sharp struggle between the two roads in the country. Therefore, we must thoroughly eliminate the influence of the bourgeoisie through great debate.

Our motherland is now experiencing an era of unprecedented leaps in history, unfolding the most glorious page in human history at a speed of "one day equals twenty years." In our generation, we will establish communism and eliminate the phenomenon of the division between manual and mental labor. Everyone masters the latest scientific technologies and has a high level of scientific theory; at the same time, everyone is an ordinary laborer. Starting from us, we will gradually realize the laborization of intellectuals, become a laborer who masters modern science, and realize the combination of mental and physical labor. This is the glorious mission entrusted to us by history. Only those who have lofty communist ideals have the spirit and ambition to be an ordinary communist laborer. The communist ordinary laborer is the most noble title and the most heroic words of mankind in a happy future world. Let us all strive to be a communist laborer who is both red and expert, and proficient in both literary and military skills!

    驳“浪费论”种种
    北京大学数学力学系学生　刘丙沉
    党提出的教育为政治服务，教育与劳动结合，培养有文化的共产主义劳动者的方针，可以说真正抓住了无产阶级教育区别于资产阶级教育的本质的问题。受资产阶级思想影响较深的人，费尽心思地拿出各式各样的论调来抵制和否定这一方针。各种论调中首要的一种就是“浪费论”。
    有人说：“在大学里培养了五年，学了很多专业理论，去做一个普通工人农民，只能从事一种简单的劳动，这不是浪费是什么呢？”有人说：“一个车床工人，主要任务是生产，他们没有什么数学、力学问题需要解决，而我们数力系的学生是专门解决数学、力学问题的，去当个车床工人只能重复某些生产过程，学用就不一致了，这岂不是浪费？”也有人说：“国家很需要数学力学工作者，数学力学工作者既然也是普通劳动者，为什么一定要去做普通工人农民呢？”
    从这些错误论调里首先可以看出，普通工人农民在这些人眼中是简单的，只能重复进行一些单纯的操作。他们瞧不起工人农民和他们的劳动。事实恰恰相反。共产主义普通劳动者是一个崇高的称号。这不但因为是他们创造了社会物质财富，而且也由于他们的劳动本身就是最富于创造性的。在祖国当前大跃进的形势下，出现了无数的奇迹，这些奇迹大多数并不是那些懂得所谓专业理论的知识分子、专家创造出来的，而是那些普通工人农民创造出来的。小麦亩产七千多斤，高粱与水稻远缘杂交成功，这都是世界上的创举，专家们连想也不敢想的事，却由农民创造出来了。这难道能说农民简单吗？北京天文馆后面一个小厂的三四个工人制出了天象仪；普通工人技术员制成了活性染料、高级抛光粉；复旦大学一个普通工人蔡祖泉成了高真空专家。从上述例子来看，我们完全可以说只有从事实际生产的普通劳动者，才是最有创造性、最有学问、最了不起的人。这些正是共产主义普通劳动者的光辉形象。做这样的普通劳动者正是无比的光荣，难道还能说是浪费了自己的才能？！
    学了数学、力学后去当工人、农民，是否就学用不一致了呢？这里，我们首先要问一句：难道普通工人、农民就不需要懂得数学力学吗？7月13日报载成都的普通工人，在没有专家、工程师的情况下，靠自己的一些经验和知识制成滑翔机，性能良好。制造滑翔机就是需要数学和力学知识的。从这个例子说明，在祖国当前大跃进的形势下，各部门有大量数学、力学问题等待着解决。例如现在小麦亩产七千斤，麦秆密得连老鼠也进不去。明年还要提高产量，地里将无“立锥之地”，人进不去只好实行高空作业。要搞高空作业就有数学和力学问题需要解决。总之，在实践中提出的数学力学问题是非常多的，而且牵涉到大量数学力学中的最新部门，这些问题若得解决，都可以为国家节约大量资金，节约大量劳动力，大大促进我国社会主义建设。这里并不存在什么学用不一致问题，问题在于我们是否有决心把知识交给人民。如果学了一些书本知识却不愿去解决生产实际问题，这才是最大的学用不一致，而是最大的浪费。
    从另方面讲，那些学了专业理论的知识分子和所谓“人材”真是那么高明吗？不是的。事实证明，脱离劳动不懂生产实践的知识分子是最无能的，这些人一遇到实际问题便一筹莫展，经常闹笑话。
    清华大学一位知名的电机专家，设计了一个小马达，设计转数每分钟二千转，制出后，每分钟只一千五百转，无论如何达不到设计转数。
    同时脱离生产实践，脱离体力劳动，在思想上必然会形成一种形而上学的思想方法，业务上必然会走上畸形的道路，解决不了实际问题。更重要的是他永远不会与劳动人民有共同的感情。所以即使有些理论知识，也做不出对人民对社会主义建设有益的工作来。让我们来看一个例子吧！数三一班一个姓洪的同学，一向被同学们认为是有“天才”的。他曾经写过几篇论文，其中一篇还在数学通报上发表过。这个天才到底如何呢？他的世界观是唯心主义的。他认为数学本身是一种抽象思维，因此学数学就要培养灵感，越抽象越好，越离奇越好，他就从胡思乱想方面来锻炼自己。在这种思想和兴趣指导下，他的“论文”都是些无聊的类似数学游戏之类的东西。这种错误的畸形的道路，使他越追求越空虚，他自己也写道“原来一切都没有意思，一切都没有追求的价值”。从这个“天才”的发展道路中使我们可以清楚地看到，如果不联系实际，不彻底改造自己的精神面貌的话，所谓天才对人民来说是个不折不扣的废物。
    由此可见，如果培养出来的人都是这样，四体不勤，五谷不分，脱离体力劳动，不懂生产实际，只有些书本知识，再加上莫名其妙的优越感，瞧不起劳动人民，解决不了实际问题——这才是对国家对人民最大的浪费。
    认为国家需要数学、力学工作者，只有去搞数学、力学研究才是对国家最有益，把发展科学看成是少数人的事，看成是可以脱离生产实际和广大人民、坐在研究所里完成的事，正是资本主义发展科学的观点和道路。只有先成为普通劳动者，让专业知识在生产实践中生根，既是数学力学工作者，又是生产中的普通劳动者；既是脑力劳动者，又是体力劳动者。那些把科学研究硬控制在少数人手里作“专利品”的人，想站在劳动人民之上指手划脚，那只能阻碍科学的发展。
    综上所述，大学毕业去做普通劳动者并非浪费，持有浪费论的人，只是说明他们轻视劳动，轻视劳动人民，放不下知识分子臭架子而已。
    为什么有人不愿做普通劳动者呢？这不是偶然的，这是由于资产阶级轻视体力劳动和劳动人民的剥削阶级观点还在一部分人的头脑中牢固存在。如果说批判了个人主义之后，还有某些人企图以知识私有，“人民非我们知识分子不行”，来保持自己将来站在劳动人民之上的特殊地位的话，那么现在提出了要做普通劳动者，做普通的工人、农民，就彻底打碎了知识私有的梦想，自然这就不能不引起抵触、抗拒和反对，这就是不少人或多或少以不同的面貌和论调来抗拒做一个普通劳动者的原因。关于作一个普通劳动者的辩论，实质上反映了国内两条道路的尖锐斗争。因此我们必须通过大争大辩，把资产阶级影响彻底肃清。
    我们的祖国现在正经历着历史上空前的飞跃的时代，以“一天等于二十年”的速度展开了人类历史最光荣的一页。在我们这一代里就要建立起共产主义，消灭体力劳动与脑力劳动分家现象。人人都掌握着最新科学技艺，具有高度的科学理论水平；同时人人都是普通劳动者。从我们开始，逐步实现知识分子劳动化，做一个掌握现代科学的劳动者，实现脑力劳动与体力劳动的结合。这是历史赋予我们的光荣使命。只有具有远大的共产主义理想的人，才有这样的气魄和雄心，去做一个共产主义的普通劳动者。共产主义普通劳动者是人类在幸福的未来世界中的最崇高的称号，最豪迈的字眼，让我们都来争取做一个又红又专、文武双全的共产主义的劳动者吧！
