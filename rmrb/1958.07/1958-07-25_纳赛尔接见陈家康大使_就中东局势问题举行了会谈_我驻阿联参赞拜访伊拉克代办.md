Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 24th: President Nasser of the United Arab Republic received Chen Jiakang, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Arab Republic, at his residence at noon today. President Nasser and Ambassador Chen Jiakang held an hour-long meeting on the current Middle East situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 24th: Zhang Yue, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in the United Arab Republic, visited Mohammed Suleiman, the Iraqi Chargé d'Affaires, at the Iraqi Embassy in the United Arab Republic this morning. Zhang Yue congratulated the Iraqi diplomatic official on the establishment of the Republic of Iraq—a major event welcomed by all the Chinese people. Zhang Yue expressed hope that relations between the two countries would become closer after mutual recognition by the two governments.

The Iraqi Chargé d'Affaires spoke of the traditional friendship and contacts between the two countries. He said that this friendly relationship would definitely develop after the victory of the Iraqi revolution. He said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "ambassador" in Baghdad was imposed on Iraq by the reactionary Nuri al-Said government and the imperialists, and it cannot represent the Chinese people.

    我驻阿联参赞拜访伊拉克代办
    新华社开罗24日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔今天中午在他的寓所接见了中国驻阿拉伯联合共和国大使陈家康。纳赛尔总统和陈家康大使就目前中东局势问题举行了一个小时的会谈。
    新华社开罗24日电　中国驻阿拉伯联合共和国大使馆参赞张越今天上午到伊拉克驻阿拉伯联合共和国大使馆拜访了伊拉克代办穆罕默德·苏莱曼。张越向这位伊拉克外交官员祝贺伊拉克共和国的成立——这是受到全中国人民欢迎的一件大事。张越希望两国间的关系在两国政府相互承认之后能够更加密切。
    伊拉克代办谈到了两国间传统的友谊和接触。他说，这种友好关系在伊拉克革命胜利之后一定会得到发展。他说，蒋介石集团在巴格达的“大使”是反动的努里·赛义德政府和帝国主义者强加于伊拉克的，它不能代表中国人民。
