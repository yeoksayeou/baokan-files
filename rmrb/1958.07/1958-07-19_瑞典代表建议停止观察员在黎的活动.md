    In the meeting on the 17th, Swedish representative Jarring formally proposed his motion to temporarily halt the activities of UN observers in Lebanon, because the American military intervention fundamentally changed the situation. He said once again: From a political point of view, it is completely inappropriate for UN observers to carry out their duties in the presence of foreign troops. He said that, however, if another plan is made for the withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon, then the situation would change. Therefore, the Swedish proposal suggests a temporary halt to the activities of the UN observers.

    Japanese representative Koto Matsudaira, in his speech, expressed his "regret" that the American government actually dispatched troops to Lebanon, especially while the Security Council was studying the situation in Lebanon. He said that the Japanese government and people hope that the American troops will stop advancing into Lebanon, and that the United Nations should resolve the Lebanese issue.

    He said: The American action of dispatching armed forces will worsen the situation. But "since the dispatch of troops by the United States is already a fait accompli," he requested that the United Nations take measures "that would enable the United States to withdraw its troops from Lebanon." He said that it was because of these considerations that he supported the American proposal with certain reservations.

    Also speaking at the meeting were representatives from Jordan, the United States, Britain, France, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

    Jordanian representative Toukan made unfounded slanderous accusations and attacks against the United Arab Republic, saying that the United Arab Republic was interfering in the internal affairs of other Arab countries. British representative Dixon shamelessly defended Britain's aggressive actions against Jordan, and he tried to prove that the British troops landing in Jordan was to "protect Jordan's independence." American representative Lodge said that the American government "supports the British measures."

    French representative Pierre de Vaucelles also expressed support for the armed aggression of Lebanon and Jordan by the United States and Britain. He also denied that the French government intended to send armed forces to participate in the military operations of the United States and Britain. The Chiang Kai-shek elements also expressed their support for the armed intervention in Middle Eastern countries by the United States and Britain.

    Soviet representative Sobolev, in his speech, pointed out the hypocrisy of Lodge's statement that the American government hopes to withdraw its troops from Lebanon as soon as possible. He asked: Who is preventing it from doing so? To do this, the American President only needs to issue an order. Why did the United States send its troops to Lebanon without any permission from the United Nations, and now it wants the United Nations to approve its withdrawal of its troops from Lebanon?

    Sobolev expressed his support for the Swedish proposal.

    The next meeting of the Security Council is scheduled to be held on the morning of July 18.

    瑞典代表建议停止观察员在黎的活动
    在17日的会议上，瑞典代表雅林正式提出了他的关于要求暂时停止联合国观察员在黎巴嫩的活动的提案，因为美国对黎巴嫩的军事干涉根本改变了局势。他再一次说：从政治观点看来，联合国观察员在有外国军队的情况下执行职务是完全不恰当的。他说，但是，如果另订一项使美国军队撤出黎巴嫩的计划，那么局势就会改变。因此，瑞典提案建议暂时停止联合国观察员的活动。
    日本代表松平康东在发言时对美国政府竟向黎巴嫩派遣军队，特别是竟在安理会研究黎巴嫩局势的时候派遣军队表示感到“遗憾”。他说，日本政府和人民希望美国军队停止开进黎巴嫩，应当由联合国来解决黎巴嫩问题。
    他说：美国派遣武装部队的行动会使局势恶化。但是“既然美国派遣军队的事已经是一个既成事实”，他要求联合国采取“能够使美国把自己的军队撤出黎巴嫩”的措施。他说，正是由于这些考虑，他才带有某些保留地支持美国的建议。
    在会议上发言的还有约旦、美国、英国、法国和蒋介石集团的代表。
    约旦代表图康对阿拉伯联合共和国进行了毫无根据的诬蔑和攻击，说什么阿拉伯联合共和国干涉其他阿拉伯国家的内政。英国代表狄克逊恬不知耻地为英国对约旦采取的侵略行动辩解，他力图证明，英国军队在约旦登陆是为了“保护约旦的独立”。美国代表洛奇说，美国政府“支持英国的措施”。
    法国代表皮埃尔·德沃塞勒也表示支持美英两国武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的行动。他同时否认法国政府打算派遣武装部队参加美英的军事行动。蒋介石分子也表示赞成美英两国武装干涉中东国家。
    苏联代表索波列夫发言时指出了洛奇所说的美国政府希望尽快地从黎巴嫩撤军这种说法的虚伪性。他问道：谁在妨碍它这样做呢？为了做到这一点，只要美国总统下一道命令就可以了。为什么美国没有得到联合国的任何许可就派自己的军队到黎巴嫩去，而现在却要联合国批准它从黎巴嫩撤出自己的军队呢？
    索波列夫表示支持瑞典的建议。
    安全理事会下一次会议定在7月18日早上举行。
