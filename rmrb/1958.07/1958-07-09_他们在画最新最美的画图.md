    They are Painting the Newest and Most Beautiful Pictures
    By Our Correspondent Lin Tian
    When I heard Chairman Mao’s words, “A blank sheet of paper, free from any burden, is best for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and for painting the newest and most beautiful pictures,” at the Baotou Iron and Steel Company construction site, I saw that among the countless heroic figures standing tall in our motherland, there was one hero right before my eyes. Brimming with ambition and high spirits, he picked up a thousand-pound brush and was painting a vivid picture on the land, which was like a blank sheet of paper. This hero is the tens of thousands of ordinary laborers building Baotou Steel; this picture is the motherland’s third large-scale iron and steel base.
    The night before last, while we were resting at the construction site, we opened our shirts to let the night breeze cool our chests, and gazing at the patches of lights on the grassland, a worker said, “Starting from scratch, it’s happening fast! When we first arrived in March 1955, there was nothing here. We’d stick a red flag in the ground to mark the construction site, and if you stepped out of your tent, you could easily get lost in the strong winds. It’s nothing like it is now!”
    Indeed, three years ago, this place was truly a blank sheet of paper. In this wilderness, where yellow sand blotted out the sky, only the most observant could find the markers left by the surveyors.
    What is it like now?
    Look! From the foot of the Ula Mountains to the banks of the Yellow River, clusters of buildings and rows of simple houses and tall buildings are appearing on the grassland, spanning dozens of kilometers. In the large factory area, the main buildings of the General Machinery Plant (repair area), which began construction last year, have risen, with eight workshops standing tall. The metal structure workshop went into production two months ago, and now the machine repair workshop has installed many machine tools. Workers are cleaning twelve-meter-long lathes, ten-meter-long gantry planers, and vertical lathes capable of processing large bell-shaped materials five meters in diameter. The steel and iron casting workshops are installing overhead cranes. Although these workshops are designed to repair and maintain machinery for Baotou Steel’s main plants, their production capacity and scale are equivalent to a relatively large heavy machinery factory, capable of manufacturing some metallurgical equipment. The foundation work for the No. 1 large-scale automated blast furnace of the iron smelting plant and its many ancillary buildings is underway; the first two large coke ovens of the coking chemical plant have already been erected with flues... Installers, welders, and scaffolders climb and run back and forth, working tirelessly. Tank-type cranes, steam cranes, and seventy-meter-high large lifters lift enormous components according to the sound of whistles and flag signals; trains roar as they approach the construction site; trucks, horse-drawn carts, and tractors pulling heavy flatbed trailers rumble along, grinding the sand into a pale powder, churning up dust. Various cables and wires, as a poet described, are like the staves of a grand labor symphony. In this "grand symphony," the workers, their faces covered in sweat, dirt, and grease, treat the scorching sun and level four or five sandstorms as nothing.
    One hundred and fifty kilometers from here, in the grasslands north of the Yin Mountains, large-scale construction is underway at the Baiyun Obo iron ore mine. Mining and construction are taking place simultaneously, with large quantities of ore being produced, and trains laden with ore depart from there almost daily.
    This scene has captivated countless heroes. Here, one can see and feel how people are pouring all their heart and soul into this magnificent undertaking with such great enthusiasm and sincerity.
    Now, let us get to know some of these people!
    On the fourth day of installing the steel reinforcement mesh for the blast furnace foundation, I arrived there. Liu Yongfeng, the director of the steel reinforcement processing plant in charge of the construction, said: Our current battle cry is to dedicate everything to the blast furnace! Perhaps some people think this slogan is inappropriate, but then look at the actual actions! The fabrication and installation of the blast furnace foundation steel reinforcement mesh had never been done before. How to do it? They sent people to Wuhan Steel to learn. But the students must surpass the teacher. Wuhan Steel’s No. 1 blast furnace took more than twenty days to complete the same project. Here, the company initially gave a deadline of twenty days. However, after the workers debated several installation plans and boldly adopted a new method proposed by technician Hui Yongquan, cadres and workers worked together to create several new tools, and they proposed a guarantee: complete it in seven days. On the first day of installation, more than an hour before work started, the workers arrived without prior agreement. It took two hours to install the first piece of steel reinforcement mesh, then it was shortened to forty-five minutes, twenty minutes, fifteen minutes. The plan was for each welder to weld twenty-five joints per shift, but they said they would not leave work until they had welded thirty to thirty-five joints. The day before yesterday, it rained, and Director Liu was afraid that the rain would cause short circuits and accidents, so he called out three times, but the workers still didn’t stop. Finally, he gave an order, and the workers came down. Two days later, when I came again, the four-layer high-legged steel reinforcement mesh with a diameter of eighteen meters was standing tall. They indeed completed the task in just over six days. The quality of the project was praised by experts.
    At the coking chemical construction site, branch secretary Liu Ruixiang and the chairman of the trade union told us that these days, they had a blackboard newspaper called “Flowers in the Leap Forward,” and new people and new stories were constantly being posted. They talked about how it had become a common phenomenon for workers to arrive early and leave late, and to voluntarily donate their labor on Sundays to repair the club or run to the factory to recycle old materials for public use. The most touching thing was that Zhang Hongpu, an old plasterer in his forties, would pick up any nail he found while walking and straighten them one by one at home with a small hammer. Recently, he handed over thirty pounds of nails to the public. He saw a crack in a water trough and, not having time to repair it during work hours, he brought his ten-year-old son on Sunday and asked him to assist him. The father and son repaired the water trough without telling anyone and went home. Once, a fellow worker said, "Old Zhang is full of energy!" He said: "We are the masters of our own house!"
    To build Baotou Steel quickly, well, and economically, enthusiasm alone is not enough. Recently, the workers have begun to shift their attention to technical innovation.
    In the steel casting workshop of the machine repair area, we met the Song Shichun crane crew, who were installing the overhead crane beams. Their electric crane was painted with the words "Youth Rocket," which was an honorary title recently awarded to them by the Communist Youth League organization. The oldest member of this group, Song Shichun, is twenty-seven years old this year. Five years ago, he was on the front lines of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. These young men dared to think and dared to act. Ordinary crane operators divide the hoisting, rotating, and lifting operations into three steps, but they combine these three movements into one step. In this way, the original output of dozens of tons of components per shift has now increased to two hundred tons, and one day they even created a record of four hundred and eighty-four tons.
    In the auto repair shop of the Mechanical Transportation Company, we also met a young man who was neglecting his sleep and meals in order to innovate technology. His name is Liu Zhixiang, and he was once a labor model in Shenyang City, attending the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction of Youth. He learned woodworking at the age of thirteen, and after mastering woodworking, he became an apprentice repairman. Because he was particularly fond of machinery, just a few days after arriving at this workshop in the spring, he discovered several problems: grinding cylinder head valves by hand takes half a day for each valve, can’t we make a machine for grinding valves? If the eccentric shaft is slightly damaged, it is replaced with a new one, costing more than three hundred yuan each, can’t we find a way to “revive” it? Since then, he often couldn’t sleep at night. When he went home for the Spring Festival, he consulted an old engineer late at night. Before even sitting down at home, he asked his mother and wife to help him find materials in the machinery factory. After returning, he found a material that needed to be dipped in medicine, but Baotou didn’t have this equipment, so he sent the material to his mother in Shenyang, who entrusted someone to dip it in medicine and send it back. In this way, he modified a woodworking drill into a valve grinding machine, increasing work efficiency by one hundred and forty-eight times, and successfully revived the eccentric shaft together with his comrades. Now he and his group are studying eleven technical innovations. When we found him, they were building a journal bearing grinding machine. He couldn’t calculate or draw, but the machine was almost finished, and an engineer was helping him with calculations and drawings. On the wall of their workspace, there was a letter of determination: Within half a year, we will change all manual operations to mechanized and semi-mechanized operations. He said: We will use this practical action to implement the general line and accelerate the construction of Baotou Steel.
    These people are the ones who are building Baotou Steel from scratch, the painters who are painting the newest and most beautiful pictures on a blank sheet of paper. Let us listen to their poetry! This is what carpenter Wang Chengwu wrote on a big-character poster:
    Stepping on the sandy beach as if on a plain, high furnaces stand before our eyes;
    Arms embrace the Ula Mountains, legs stretch to Baiyun Mountain (i.e., Baiyun Obo Iron Mine);
    Changing the old look of Baotou, the workers’ ambition strengthens the rivers and mountains.
    It is certain that with people of such style and drive, what is there that cannot be accomplished?

    他们在画最新最美的画图
    本报记者  林田
    当我在包头钢铁公司工地听到毛主席的话“一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图”的时候，我看到，祖国无数顶天立地的英雄中，有一个英雄就在我眼前。他缅怀志气，意气激昂，拿起千斤画笔，在犹如白纸的大地上，描画着一幅活生生的画图。这英雄，就是建设包钢的成千上万的普通劳动者；这画图，就是祖国第三个大型钢铁基地。
    前天夜里，我们在工地休息的时候，敞开衣服让夜风吹吹胸膛，望着草原上的一片片灯火，一个工人说：“平地起家，也快！1955年3月我们刚到的时候，这些地方啥也没有，插个红旗，便是工地，出了帐篷，刮起大风来你就简直找不回来。哪像现在这个样子！”
    是的，三年以前，这里真是白纸一张。在这黄沙蔽天的旷野里，只有细心的人才能找到勘测人员留下的标志。
    现在怎样呢？
    看吧！从乌拉山麓到黄河边上，一处处的建筑群，一片片的平舍高楼，出现在方圆几十公里的草原上。在大厂区，去年开工的机械总厂（机修区），八个车间高大的厂房站起来了，金属结构车间两个月前投入了生产，现在机修车间已经安好了很多台机床。工人们正在清洗十二公尺长的大车床、十公尺的龙门刨床和能加工直径五公尺大料钟的立式车床。铸钢铸铁车间正在安装天车。这些车间虽说是为包钢主体工厂修理维护机械而设的，它们的生产能力和规模却相当于一个较大的重型机械厂，可以制造一部分冶金设备。炼铁厂的第一号大型自动化高炉和它的许多附属建筑物的基础工程正在施工；焦炭化学厂的头两座大焦炉已经砌好了烟道，……安装工、电焊工、架子工在上面爬过来跑过去，不停地工作。坦克式吊车、蒸汽吊车、七十公尺高的大抱子，按着笛声和旗语，把庞大的构件吊起来；火车吼叫着开到了工地跟前；汽车、马车和拖着载重板车的拖拉机，隆隆地奔驰，沙土被碾成了发白的粉末，尘雾翻腾。各种电缆、电线，如同一位诗人所形容的，像是劳动大乐章的五线谱。在这个“大乐章”里，工人们个个满脸汗污油垢，他们把当头烈日和四五级的风沙视同等闲。
    距这里一百五十公里，阴山以北草原上，白云鄂博铁矿山正在进行着大规模的建设。一边建设，一边采矿，大量生产矿石，几乎每天都有载着矿石的列车从那里开来。
    这幅图景，吸引住了无数的英雄们。在这里，随处可以看到和感触到，人们以怎样的豪情挚意，把全部身心倾注在这个瑰丽的事业上。
    现在让我们结识一下这些人吧！
    高炉基础安装钢筋网的第四天，我到了那里。指挥施工的钢筋加工厂厂长刘永丰说：我们现在的战斗口号是把一切献给高炉！也许有人认为这口号不合适，那就看看实际行动吧！高炉基础钢筋网的制作安装工程，过去没干过。怎么做，他们是派人到武钢学来的。可是学生要超过先生，武钢一号高炉同样工程用了二十多天，这里，公司里开始也给二十天期限。可是经过职工们对几种安装方案展开了辩论，大胆采用了技术员惠永权提出的新办法，干部、工人又一齐动手动脑创造了几种新工具，就提出了保证：七天干完。安装的第一天，上班前一个多小时，工人们就不约而同地到齐了。安第一片钢筋网用了两小时，接着就缩短到四十五分钟，二十分，十五分。计划每个焊工每班焊二十五个接头，他们说，不焊三十个到三十五个不下班。前天下雨，刘厂长怕雨大串电出事故，喊了三次，工人仍不停工，最后他下了命令，工人才下来了。隔了两天，我再来的时候，直径十八公尺的四层高脚钢筋网矗立起来了。他们果然用六天多点的时间，完成了任务。工程质量受到了专家的赞扬。
    在焦化工地上，支部书记刘瑞祥和工会主席对我们讲，这些天，他们搞了个“跃进中的花朵”黑板报，新人新故事登不完。他们谈到工人们早上班晚下班成了普遍现象，星期日自动献工（义务劳动）修俱乐部，或跑到厂里回收旧料缴公。最使人感动的，是四十多岁的老抹灰工张洪普，他走路遇到个钉子就拾起来，晚上在家拿个小锤一根根锤直，最近一次向公家交了三十斤钉子。他看到一个水槽子裂了缝，上班时间没空修理，星期天就带着十岁的小儿子来了，叫儿子给他作下手，父子俩把水槽修好，谁也不告诉一声，就回去了。有次一位工友说：老张头干劲好足啊！他说：咱自己是当家的嘛！
    要多快好省地建设包钢，单凭热情还不够，最近，工人们开始把注意力转到技术革新上。
    在机修区的铸钢车间里，我们会见了正在安装天车梁的宋世纯吊车组。他们的电动吊车上，漆着“青年火箭号”字样，这是共青团组织最近赠给他们的光荣称号。他们这个小组，年纪最大的宋世纯，今年二十七岁，五年以前，他在抗美援朝的前线上。这些小伙子敢想敢作，一般的吊车工，是把抬杆、回转、起重分作三步操作，他们却把这三个动作合成一步。这样，原来每台班吊装几十吨构件，现在提高到了二百吨，有一天竟创造了四百八十四吨的纪录。
    在机运公司的汽车修理车间里，我们还遇到了一个为了革新技术而废寝忘食的青年人。他叫刘志祥，曾经是沈阳市的劳动模范，出席过全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。他十三岁学作木工，木工学成以后，又来当修理工的徒工。因为他特别爱机械，今年春天刚到这个车间不几天，就发现了几个问题：汽缸盖的汽门用手磨，半天磨一个，不能作个磨汽门的机器吗？偏心轴磨坏一点就换新的，一个三百多元，不能想办法“复活”吗？从此，他夜里常常睡不着觉，春节回家时深夜里向一位老工程师请教，进家没坐稳就让母亲和爱人帮他到机械厂找材料，回来以后他找到一种材料要蘸药，包头没这种设备，他又把这材料寄给沈阳他母亲，由母亲托人蘸了药又寄回来。就这样，现在他用一台木工钻床改装了一台磨汽门的机器，工作效率提高了一百四十八倍，复活偏心轴也和同志们一齐作成功了。现在他又在和小组研究着十一项技术革新。我们找到他的时候，他们正在造一台磨轴瓦的机器，他不会计算和画图，机器快作成了，一位工程师正帮他作计算和画图。在他们工作间的墙上，贴着一个决心书：半年之内，把全部手工操作改成机械化和半机械化。他说：我们就用这个实际行动来贯彻总路线，加快建设包钢。
    这些人，就是平地起家建设包钢的人，就是在白纸上画最新最美的画图的画家。让我们听听他们的诗歌吧！这是木工王成武写在大字报上的：
    脚踏沙滩如平川，高炉耸立在眼前；
    胳膊抱住乌拉岭，两腿伸到白云山（即白云鄂博铁矿山）
    改变包头老样子，工人志气壮河山。
    可以肯定，有着这样风格和干劲的人们，有什么事情做不成呢？
