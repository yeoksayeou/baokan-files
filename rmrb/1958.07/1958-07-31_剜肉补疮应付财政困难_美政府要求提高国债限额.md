Xinhua News Agency, July 29th, Washington Dispatch: President Eisenhower wrote to Congress on the 28th requesting an increase in the national debt limit, so that the US government can further borrow money to cope with financial difficulties.

The US Congress originally approved a statutory maximum limit of $275 billion for US government borrowing, and later agreed to temporarily raise it to $280 billion. Eisenhower is now requesting that the statutory maximum limit be raised to $285 billion, and the temporary maximum limit be raised to $288 billion.

Eisenhower's letter indicates that the reason he is requesting an increase in the national debt limit is that the US government's budget will have a huge deficit in the current fiscal year, and the US government needs to borrow money, making it impossible to limit the national debt to within $275 billion.

Xinhua News Agency, July 30th, Washington Dispatch: President Eisenhower, while discussing the Middle East situation with congressional leaders on the 29th, requested the restoration of foreign aid appropriations cut by the House of Representatives to meet the "special needs" of Turkey and Iran.

    剜肉补疮应付财政困难
    美政府要求提高国债限额
    新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔28日写信给国会要求提高国债限额，使美国政府可以进一步借债来应付财政困难。
    美国国会原来批准的美国政府借债的法定最高限额是二千七百五十亿美元，后来同意暂时提高到二千八百亿美元，艾森豪威尔现在要求把法定最高限额提高到二千八百五十亿美元，暂时的最高限额提高到二千八百八十亿美元。
    艾森豪威尔的信表明，他所以要求提高国债限额，是因为美国政府的预算在本财政年度将有庞大的赤字，美国政府需要借债，要把国债数目限制在二千七百五十亿美元的范围内是不可能的。
    据新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔29日在同国会领袖谈到中东局势时要求恢复众议院削减的援外拨款以满足土耳其和伊朗的“特殊需要”。
