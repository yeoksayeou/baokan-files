Prime Minister Qasim said while meeting a group of journalists from the United Arab Republic in Baghdad that the first task of the Iraqi Republic government is to formulate broad plans to improve the domestic situation. He also said that the government will consult with loyal Iraqi citizens and will cooperate with Arab countries to plan a common policy for the future.

Qasim said that the Iraqi revolutionary movement originated in the hearts of the Iraqi people and is in line with their feelings and goals. Based on past experiences and lessons, they have adopted a policy of cooperation between loyal people and free officers. He said that the revolution was joined by loyal soldiers and citizens. The formation of the revolution is based on the relationship between those who are loyal to the country and enthusiastic about serving its interests, rather than on political parties or personal interests.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 20th: "Al-Ahram" reported from Baghdad on the 19th that a revolutionary court has been established in Baghdad to try those accused of treason.

The newspaper said that Iraqi military attache to Beirut, Daghastani, and Brigade Commander Colonel Omar Ali will be the first to be tried for treason. Omar was arrested because he ordered his troops to disobey the orders of the revolutionary authorities when the revolution broke out.

The Iraqi authorities have also ordered the arrest of members of Syrian reactionary parties who infiltrated Iraq before the revolution, especially those who assassinated Syrian patriots.

The report also said that politicians of the old regime, fearing the angry Iraqi people, have turned themselves in for trial. Among these people are: former Iraqi Prime Minister Ahmed Mukhtar Baban, former Minister of Interior Said Qazzaz, and former Minister of Finance and Economy Nadim Pachachi.

    卡塞姆总理申明伊拉克革命目的
    消灭帝国主义及其代理人
    巴格达设立革命法庭审讯卖国贼
    新华社开罗19日电  伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆在18日说，伊拉克革命的目的是为了“消灭帝国主义和它的代理人，根除国内的腐化现象，并且恢复伊拉克同其它阿拉伯国家之间的团结”。
    卡塞姆总理在巴格达接见一批阿拉伯联合共和国记者时说，伊拉克共和国政府首先要做的工作是制订广泛的计划以改善国内情况。他又说，政府将同忠诚的伊拉克公民进行磋商，并且将同阿拉伯国家合作来计划关于未来的共同政策。
    卡塞姆说，伊拉克革命运动是从伊拉克人民的心里产生的，是顺应他们的感情和目标的。他们根据过去的经验教训，采取了忠诚的人民和自由军官合作的政策。他说，参加革命的有忠实的军人和公民。革命的形成是以效忠国家、热心为它的利益服务的那些人们之间的关系为基础的，而不是以政党或个人利益为基础的。
    新华社开罗20日电  “金字塔报”19日巴格达消息，巴格达已经设立了革命法庭，对被控有卖国罪名的人进行审讯。
    这家报纸说，伊拉克驻贝鲁特武官达吉斯塔尼和旅长欧默尔·阿里上校将首先以叛国罪受审。欧默尔被捕是由于在革命爆发时他命令他的部队违抗革命当局的命令。
    伊拉克当局还下令逮捕那些在革命以前渗入伊拉克的叙利亚反动党派成员，特别是那些暗杀叙利亚爱国人士的人。
    消息还说，旧政权的政客们由于害怕愤怒的伊拉克人民，已自己投案接受审讯。这些人中有：伊拉克前首相艾哈迈德·穆赫塔尔·巴班、前内政大臣赛义德·卡扎兹、前财政大臣兼经济大臣纳迪姆·帕查奇。
