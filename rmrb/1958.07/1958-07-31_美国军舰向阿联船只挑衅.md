　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 30th—"Al-Ahram" quoted a statement by the captain of the Egyptian ship "Isis" today, reporting that the "Isis," which arrived in Alexandria yesterday from the Syrian region, had been provoked twice by US Sixth Fleet warships. When the Egyptian ship was sailing between Cyprus and Beirut, US Sixth Fleet warships—including nine cruisers and one aircraft carrier—approached it and inquired about the ship's nationality, even though the ship was flying the flag of the United Arab Republic. US aircraft also flew low over the Egyptian ship multiple times.

    美国军舰向阿联船只挑衅
    新华社开罗30日电　“金字塔报”今天援引埃及船“伊西斯号”船长的声明报道说，昨天从叙利亚地区到达亚历山大港的“伊西斯号”，曾经受到美国第六舰队军舰的两次挑衅。当这艘埃及船在塞浦路斯和贝鲁特之间航行的时候，美国第六舰队的军舰——其中包括九艘巡洋舰和一艘航空母舰——曾经向它靠近并且询问这艘船的国籍，虽然这艘船一直悬挂着阿拉伯联合共和国的国旗。美国飞机还多次在埃及船上空低低飞行。
