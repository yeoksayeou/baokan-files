In the area where Guizhou Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region meet, there is the Hongshui River. On the north bank of this river and its tributary, the Nanpan River, is where more than 1.2 million Bouyei people of our country live. According to investigations by relevant departments, Bouyei people are distributed in 62 counties and cities in Guizhou Province, with relatively concentrated populations in Wangmo, Ceheng, Luodian, Libo, and Zhenfeng counties.

The Bouyei people originally called themselves "Buyi," "Buyueyi," and "Buyeyi." The Bouyei people had close ties with the Zhuang people thousands of years ago. Later, due to prolonged ethnic oppression and transportation blockades, the people of the two places had less contact, and after a long period of independent development, the Bouyei ethnic group of today was formed. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, this ethnic group was not only not recognized, but even its inherent ethnic name was buried, and they were called Zhongjia, Yi, Bendi, Shuihu, Tujia, etc. In 1953, after full consultation among representatives of the Bouyei ethnic group in the province, it was officially unified to use "Bouyei" as the name of the ethnic group.

The Bouyei are a hardworking and courageous people. During the Qing Dynasty and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, they constantly launched revolutionary struggles to safeguard the survival and development of their ethnic group. As early as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising, the Bouyei people actively responded and participated. After 1930, under the influence of the Seventh Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in Guangxi and the Right River Soviet regime, the Bouyei farmers in the border areas of Wangmo, Luodian, Ziyun, and Zhenfeng counties, together with other fraternal ethnic groups, organized armed uprisings and carried out revolutionary activities; and successively repelled many encirclements and suppressions by the Kuomintang bandit army, and once liberated Wangmo county seat. In 1949, the Bouyei people of Guizhou Province, together with all ethnic groups, were liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and in August 1956, they jointly established the Qiannan Bouyei-Miao Autonomous Prefecture with the Miao people, realizing their aspiration to be masters of their own affairs.

    布依族
    贵州省和广西僮族自治区交界的地方，有一条红水河。在这条河以及它的支流南盘江的北岸，就是我国一百二十多万布依族人民聚居的地方。据有关部门调查，在贵州省的六十二个县、市都有布依族分布，其中又以望谟、册亨、罗甸、荔波、贞丰等县较为集中。
    布依族原自称“布依”、“布约依”、“布叶依”。布依族在千百年以前，曾和僮族有密切的联系，以后由于较长时期的民族压迫和交通阻塞等原因，两地人民往来少了，经过长期的各自发展，便形成了今天的布依族。在国民党反动统治时期，这个民族不仅不被承认，连固有的民族名称都被埋没，被称为仲家、夷族、本地、水户、土家等。1953年全省布依族代表人士经过充分协商，正式统一用“布依”作为本民族名称。
    布依族是一个勤劳、勇敢的民族。他们在清朝和国民党反动统治时期，为了维护本民族的生存和发展，曾不断地掀起革命斗争。早在太平天国起义中，布依族人民就积极响应和参加。1930年以后，在广西中国工农红军第七军和右江苏维埃政权影响下，望谟、罗甸、紫云、贞丰四县边区的布依族农民，和其他兄弟民族一道，组织起义武装，进行革命活动；并先后击退了国民党匪军的多次围攻，一度解放望谟县城。1949年，贵州省布依族人民，和各民族一起，在中国共产党领导下获得解放，并且在1956年8月和苗族共同建立了黔南布依族苗族自治州，实现了当家作主的愿望。
