    Honeysuckle

    Honeysuckle is a small shrub that grows in the fields. Its oval leaves are a lush green and remain through the winter, hence its other name, "Winter Endurance Flower." In early summer, it blooms with small white flowers, which turn yellow after two or three days. People call the yellow flowers "gold flowers" and the white flowers "silver flowers." On one branch, the yellow and white flowers complement each other beautifully, hence the popular name "Honeysuckle."

    Honeysuckle is widely distributed, with large quantities produced throughout China, such as in Zhejiang, Guangdong, Henan, Anhui, and Shandong. The unopened flower buds are picked and dried in a ventilated place, becoming an excellent medicinal material. The flowers contain fiber sugar, the stems contain saponins, and the leaves contain tannins. Its therapeutic uses are extensive, with diuretic, antipyretic, antibacterial, and antifungal properties. It can relieve summer heat and quench thirst, clear heat and detoxify, and is also an effective remedy for dysentery. It is said that Tao Hongjing, a famous pharmacist of the Liang Dynasty, cured his mother's severe dysentery with a decoction made from honeysuckle. Honeysuckle has mild medicinal properties and a slightly fragrant aroma, making it suitable as a summer beverage. Here are four ways to prepare it:

    1. Honeysuckle Tea: Use three qian (15 grams) each time, brew it with tea leaves using boiling water.

    2. Honeysuckle Porridge: Use five qian (25 grams) each time, boil it in water to make two large bowls of juice, then add sorghum flour, rice flour, or millet flour to make porridge (you can add a little sugar if desired).

    3. Honeysuckle Drink: Use one liang (50 grams) of honeysuckle, five fen (1.5 grams) of Coptis chinensis (Huang Lian), and a small piece of ginger, brew them together with boiling water in a bowl. Once the water turns yellow, it is ready to drink. You can re-brew it twice.

    4. Honeysuckle Candied Fruit: Prepare two liang (100 grams) of honeysuckle, two liang (100 grams) of hawthorn slices, and three liang (150 grams) of brown sugar. First, stir-fry the hawthorn slices over low heat for five minutes, then add the brown sugar and stir-fry for another five minutes. Then add the honeysuckle and stir-fry until it resembles candied fruit. After frying, it can be divided into four servings. Each time, put one-fourth in a porcelain teapot, brew it with boiling water and drink it as tea, and you can re-brew it two or three times.

    The first two of the above four beverages have the functions of relieving summer heat, reducing fever, and treating diarrhea, while the latter two can prevent and treat dysentery and indigestion. In particular, the fourth one is sweet and sour, and can also cure diseases, so it is worth a try.

    金银花
    洪希
    金银花是蔓生于田野间的小灌木。椭圆形的叶子，绿蔚蔚地凌冬不枯，所以又叫作忍冬花。初夏开小白花，两三天就变成黄色，民间管黄色花叫金花，白色花叫银花。一枝之上，黄白相映，非常好看，金银花的名字因此响亮地叫在民间了。
    金银花产地很广，我国大江南北，如浙江、广东、河南、安徽以及山东等地，都有大量出产。把含苞未放的花蕾摘下来，放在通风处吹干，就成一种出色的药材。花里含有纤维糖，茎含有皂素，叶含有鞣质。它的治疗效用很广泛，具有利尿、解热、杀菌、驱霉的功能，可以去暑止渴，清火解毒，而且是治疗痢疾的良药。据说，我国梁代有名的药学家陶弘景的母亲得了很重的痢疾，就是用了一味金银花煎的水治好的。金银花药性平和，并且具有一种淡微微的清香味道，可以用作夏天的饮料，这里介绍四种作法：
    1．金银花茶：每次用三钱，和茶叶一起，用开水泡作茶喝。
    2．金银花粥：每次用五钱，放水煮出两大碗汁，加进高粱面或大米面、小米面煮粥喝（可以适当加点白糖）。
    3．金银花饮：金银花一两，黄连五分，姜一小片，和在一起用开水冲成一碗，等水色见黄，就可以喝了。这可以连冲二次喝。
    4．金银花饯：准备好金银花二两、山楂片二两、红糖三两。先将山楂片用微火炒五分钟，放进红糖再合炒五分钟，然后再放进金银花，合炒成糖饯的样子。炒成后可分四次用。每次把四分之一放在瓷壶里，用开水冲了当茶水喝，接连着还可冲二、三次。
    以上四种饮料，前两种具有去暑解热和治疗腹泻的功能，后两种可以防治痢疾和消化不良。特别是第四种，酸甜可口，又能去病，值得一试。
