A Grain of Rice Produces 85 Spikes

Recently, the Chaling Cooperative in Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, harvested a field of Nantespecies rice and discovered five unusual rice plants. These five plants grew from five grains of rice seed, were taller than a person, had green leaves, black stems as thick as fingers, and each averaged sixty effective spikes, with one plant having eighty-five spikes; each spike averaged three hundred and eighty-five grains, with one spike reaching four hundred and thirty grains; each plant produced approximately thirteen thousand grains of rice, which the local people are spreading as a marvel.

The field where these five rice plants were located was originally a fish pond, with fertile soil. When Nantespecies were planted in the early rice crop this year, the rice plants grew well, with each plant generally having twenty-five spikes, each spike having about one hundred and forty grains, and the average yield per mu reaching six hundred and forty jin.

    一粒谷出85个穗
    广东东莞县茶岭社最近收割一块南特种的稻田，发现有五棵异种的禾，这五棵由五粒谷种发起来的，高过人头，叶青、茎黑、粗如手指的稻禾，每棵平均有效分蘖六十穗，其中一棵八十五穗；每穗平均三百八十五粒，其中一穗达四百三十粒；每棵长谷粒约有一万三千多，当地群众传为奇谈。
    这五棵禾所在的田，原是一个鱼塘，土地肥美。今年早造种上南特，稻禾生长良好，每棵一般有二十五穗，每穗约有一百四十粒，平均亩产达到六百四十斤。
