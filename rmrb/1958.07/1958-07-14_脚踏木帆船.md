    Foot-Powered Wooden Sailboat

    A foot-powered wooden sailboat has recently appeared in Qingyang County, Anhui Province.

    This wooden sailboat was modified by the Mutan Wooden Sailboat Cooperative in Qingyang County from ordinary wooden sailboats. They installed a foot-powered propeller at the stern of the boat to replace the hand-operated oars. After testing, it was found that using a foot-powered propeller instead of hand-operated oars on a wooden sailboat with a load capacity of about ten tons could increase the speed from five *hua li* per hour to ten *hua li* per hour. The number of boatmen required can be reduced from two to one, and the labor intensity of the boatman can be reduced. The foot-powered propeller is mainly made of wood, and each unit costs only about thirty yuan to manufacture.

    脚踏木帆船
    安徽省青阳县最近出现了一种脚踏木帆船。
    这种木帆船是青阳县木镇木帆船合作社用普通的木帆船改装的。他们在船的尾部安装一个脚踏螺旋桨，代替手摇的划桨。经过试验，载重十吨左右的木帆船用脚踏螺旋桨代替手摇划桨，每小时的航速可由五华里增加到十华里，撑船的人可由两人减少到一人，并且减轻了撑船人的劳动强度。脚踏螺旋桨主要是用木制的，每部造价只有三十元左右。
