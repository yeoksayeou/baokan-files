    The Struggle of the Jordanian People

    Like the Arab people who have already gained freedom, the Jordanian people have also waged a long struggle for freedom, and once raised the banner of freedom. Last year, the United States subverted the Jordanian nationalist regime, but it can never take the banner of freedom from the hands of the Jordanian people. Now, the old enemy of the Jordanian people, British imperialism, has returned and is attempting, along with the American aggressors, to strangle the Republic of Iraq, which has raised the banner of freedom high. However, it is quite clear that the rusty British bayonets will inevitably be submerged in the greater sea of ​​anger of the Jordanian people and all the Arab people.

    The history of the Jordanian people is a bloody history of imperialist aggression, but it is also a heroic history of the Jordanian people striving for independence and freedom. Jordan was originally part of ancient Palestine and was ruled by Turkey, belonging to the Ottoman Empire, from the beginning of the 16th century. After the First World War, the Ottoman Empire collapsed, but Palestine became a British mandate. In 1922, Britain separated Jordan from Palestine. From this time on, the rule of the British colonialists in Jordan began, and so did the Jordanian people's struggle against British rule.

    As early as the 1920s, several heroic people's uprisings broke out continuously in the Bedouin region of southern Jordan. The British colonialists panicked and hurriedly built a hell of enslavement and suppression. After the so-called "Arab Legion" was established in Jordan in 1923, it was commanded by the notorious British General Glubb. In February 1928, the twenty-year "Anglo-Jordanian Treaty" was forced upon the Jordanian people. But the Jordanian people were not conquered. Strikes and demonstrations against the "Anglo-Jordanian Treaty" spread throughout the country, and armed uprisings against military suppression broke out again. From 1934, Jordanian people's guerrillas haunted the mountainous areas of northern Jordan, destroying the colonialists' transportation and blowing up oil pipelines passing through Jordan, making the colonialists, armed to the teeth, exhausted.

    After the Second World War, in March 1946, the British colonialists were forced to declare Jordan "independent" on the one hand, and supported the descendants of the Hashemite dynasty to implement feudal autocracy on the other. In 1948, Britain replaced the old treaty that had expired with a new twenty-year treaty of enslavement. According to the new treaty, the British colonialists were the supreme rulers of Jordan. At the same time, American forces also began to infiltrate Jordan, trying their best to squeeze out Britain, and together with Britain, suppressed and plundered the Jordanian people. However, the Jordanian people's struggle for freedom was not weakened, but intensified.

    The struggle to drive away Glubb, the so-called "uncrowned king of Jordan," whose hands were stained with the blood of the Jordanian people, was a victory in which the Jordanian people held high the banner of freedom, a victory that caused a sensation in public opinion.

    This struggle began with the Jordanian people's opposition to the Baghdad Pact. In December 1955, in order to drag Jordan into the Baghdad military group, Britain specially sent the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Templer, to Jordan to conspire with Glubb. However, the secret was leaked, and the Jordanian people were infinitely angry and immediately took action. Large-scale demonstrations, strikes, and rallies broke out in Amman, Nablus, and the Arab area of ​​Jerusalem. The flames of struggle soon spread throughout the country. The "Arab Legion" led by Glubb once again carried out bloody suppression, massacring unarmed demonstrators. However, the tide of the Jordanian people's struggle rose higher, forcing the Jordanian government to announce that it would not participate in the Baghdad Pact. The people won. The people further demanded the recovery of sovereignty and placing the country's army under the control of Arabs, that is to say, Glubb must get out! The power of the people is irresistible, and the Jordanian government once again made concessions to the people and accepted the people's demands. In March 1956, Glubb, the colonialist executioner who had been rampant in Jordan for more than 30 years, was finally driven out of Jordanian territory. Glubb's throne, as well as the plans of London and Washington to drag Jordan into the Baghdad military group, were buried by the Jordanian people.

    Next, the Jordanian people's struggle unfolded a new situation: establishing a nationalist regime above the Hussein dynasty and finally smashing the shackles of American colonialism.

    In June 1956, under pressure from the people, the Hussein dynasty ordered the dissolution of the pro-Western parliament and held new general elections. The struggle surrounding the general election began. The Jordanian patriotic and democratic parties put forward an election program of abolishing the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty, striving for national independence and sovereignty, and implementing a policy of peace and neutrality. Even the pro-Western reactionary parties did not dare to put forward the opposite program. The British colonialists, relying on the authority of stationing troops in Jordan under unequal treaties, interfered in the election, attempting to support their agents to power. However, as a result of the October election, the patriotic and democratic parties won, and Nabusi, the leader of the nationalist party with the most seats—the National Socialist Party—formed a cabinet. The nationalist regime was established.

    The Nabusi cabinet fulfilled its election promises and announced on November 27, 1956, the abolition of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty and the withdrawal of British military bases in Jordan. The Nabusi cabinet pursued a policy of peace and neutrality and established friendly relations with Egypt, Syria, and other Arab national independent countries. Jordan joined the ranks of the Arab people's independence, freedom, and unity. The foundation of imperialist enslavement of Jordan was further shaken. The British colonialists, the decades-old enemy of the Jordanian people, were forced to withdraw their last troops from Jordan on July 6, 1957. At this time, the most ferocious American imperialism attempted to put the "Eisenhower Doctrine" chains around the necks of the Jordanian people, but it did not succeed. The Nabusi cabinet rejected the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The Jordanian people have written an indelible page in the history of their long struggle for independence and freedom.

    Imperialism will never be reconciled. The Jordanian people's struggle is still tortuous. In April 1957, after careful and insidious planning, the American imperialism adopted despicable subversive means and overthrew the nationalist regime headed by Nabusi. The corrupt and reactionary Hussein dynasty completely relied on imperialism, accepted the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and carried out cruel suppression of patriotic and democratic forces. In February of this year, the Jordanian Hussein dynasty and the Iraqi Faisal dynasty formed the "Arab Federation," becoming a tool for the American and British imperialists to invade the Middle East and split the unity of Arab countries. However, the Jordanian people, who had achieved significant victories, have never succumbed. Arab nationalist forces are still strong in Jordan. The struggle is still going on. Imperialism and its agents—the reactionary dynasties—are well aware that their rule is unstable. The American conspiracy to expel more than 400,000 Palestinian refugees to southern Jordan and the mountainous areas of Iraq is aimed at weakening a powerful force in the Jordanian people's struggle for independence and freedom—the Palestinian Arabs. One of the purposes of establishing the "Arab Federation" was to rely on the Iraqi Faisal dynasty, which was then considered the most solid by the imperialists, to support the crumbling rule of the Jordanian Hussein dynasty. But now, like a thunderbolt, the Iraqi people have achieved revolutionary victory, and the banner of freedom has been raised in Iraq.

    The "Arab Federation" has disintegrated. The Jordanian people originally wanted to launch a revolution at the same time as the Iraqi people. Although they failed, the Jordanian people held demonstrations and parades, cheering the revolutionary victory of their Iraqi brothers, opposing the return of British aggressors, and opposing the conspiracy of American and British aggressors to interfere in the Republic of Iraq. The banner of freedom in the hands of the Jordanian people is still being held high.

### 约旦人民的斗争

    约旦人民的斗争
    像已经得到自由的阿拉伯人民那样，约旦人民也为自由而进行了长期斗争，并曾经一度把自由的旗帜升起。去年美国颠复了约旦民族主义政权，但永远不能从约旦人民手中夺去自由旗帜。现在，约旦人民的老仇人英帝国主义卷土重来，还企图与美国侵略者一起扼杀高举起自由旗帜的伊拉克共和国。可是，完全可以看到，生了锈的英国刺刀，必然要被淹没在约旦人民和全阿拉伯人民更大的愤怒的火海中。
    约旦人民的历史，是一部帝国主义侵略的血腥史，但又是一部约旦人民争取独立自由的英雄史。约旦原是古老的巴勒斯坦的一部分，从十六世纪初叶起，就被土耳其所统治，属奥斯曼帝国。第一次世界大战后，奥斯曼帝国的大厦塌了，巴勒斯坦却成了英国的委任统治地。1922年英国把约旦从巴勒斯坦分出来。从这时候起，开始了英国殖民者在约旦的统治，也开始了约旦人民反对英国统治的斗争。
    早在二十世纪的二十年代，约旦南部贝都印地区就连续爆发了数次英勇的人民起义。英国殖民者着慌了，急忙高筑奴役和镇压的地狱。1923年在约旦成立了所谓“阿拉伯军团”后由臭名远扬的英国将军格拉布任司令。1928年2月，又把为期二十年的“英约条约”强加在约旦人民身上。但约旦人民没有被征服，反对“英约条约”的罢工罢市和群众示威遍及全国，反抗军事镇压的武装起义再度爆发了。从1934年起，约旦人民游击队出没在约旦北部山区，捣毁殖民者的交通，炸毁通过约旦的输油管，使武装到牙齿的殖民者疲于奔命。
    第二次世界大战以后，英国殖民者于1946年3月一面被迫宣布约旦“独立”，一面扶植哈希姆王朝的后裔实行封建专制统治。1948年，英国以新的二十年奴役条约代替已经满期的旧条约。根据新条约，英国殖民者是统治约旦的太上皇。与此同时，美国势力也开始渗入约旦，竭力排挤英国，又与英国一同镇压和掠夺约旦人民。但是，约旦人民争取自由的斗争不是削弱，而是更加高涨了。
    赶走双手满染约旦人民的鲜血的所谓“约旦的无冕王”格拉布的斗争，就是约旦人民高举自由旗帜的一次轰动舆论的胜利。
    这一斗争，是从约旦人民反对巴格达条约开始的。1955年12月，英国为了把约旦拖进巴格达军事集团，特派帝国总参谋长田普勒到约旦，与格拉布进行密谋。但是，秘密泄露了，约旦人民无限愤怒，并立刻行动起来。安曼、纳布鲁斯和耶路撒冷阿拉伯区爆发了大规模的示威、罢工和集会抗议。斗争的火焰随即燃遍全国。格拉布率领的
  “阿拉伯军团”又一次进行血腥的镇压，屠杀手无寸铁的示威群众。但是，约旦人民的斗争浪潮卷得更高，迫使约旦政府宣布不参加巴格达条约。人民胜利了。人民进一步要求收回主权，把国家的陆军置于阿拉伯人的控制下，也就是说，格拉布必须滚蛋！人民的威力不可抗拒，约旦政府又一次对人民让步，接受了人民的要求。1956年3月，横行约旦三十多年的殖民主义刽子手格拉布，终于被赶出了约旦的国土。格拉布的宝座，还有伦敦和华盛顿要把约旦拖进巴格达军事集团的计划，就这样地被约旦人民埋葬了。
    接着，约旦人民的斗争开展了新的局面：在侯赛因王朝上面建立民族主义的政权，最后粉碎美国殖民主义的枷锁。
    1956年6月，在人民的压力下，侯赛因王朝下令解散亲西方的议会，重新举行大选。围绕大选的斗争开始了。约旦爱国民主党派提出了废除英约条约，争取民族独立主权，执行和平中立政策的竞选纲领。连亲西方的反动政党也不敢提出相反的纲领。英国殖民者凭借不平等条约在约旦驻军的权威，干预选举，企图扶植他们的代理人上台。但是，10月选举的结果，爱国民主政党取得了胜利，由获得最多议席的民族主义政党——国家社会党的领袖纳布西组阁。民族主义政权建立起来了。
    纳布西内阁实践竞选诺言，于1956年11月27日宣布废除英约条约，撤销英国在约旦的军事基地。纳布西内阁执行和平中立、同埃及、叙利亚等阿拉伯民族独立国家建立友好关系的政策。约旦走进了阿拉伯人民独立自由和团结的行列。帝国主义奴役约旦的根基发生了进一步的动摇。约旦人民数十年的仇人英国殖民主义者，被迫于1957年7月6日从约旦撤出了最后一批军队。在这个时候，最凶恶的美帝国主义企图把“艾森豪威尔主义”的锁链加在约旦人民的颈项，也没有得逞。纳布西内阁拒绝了
  “艾森豪威尔主义”。约旦人民在争取独立自由的长期斗争的史页上，写上了不可磨灭的一页。
    帝国主义决不甘心。约旦人民的斗争仍然是曲折的。1957年4月，美帝国主义经过周密的阴险的策谋，采取卑鄙的颠复手段，推翻了以纳布西为首的民族主义政权。腐朽反动的侯赛因王朝完全投靠帝国主义，接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”，对爱国民主力量实行残酷的镇压。今年2月，约旦侯赛因王朝和伊拉克费萨尔王朝结成了“阿拉伯联邦”，成为美英帝国主义侵略中东、分裂阿拉伯国家的团结的工具。但是，曾经取得了重大胜利的约旦人民，决没有屈服。阿拉伯民族主义力量，在约旦仍然是强大的。斗争仍在进行着。帝国主义和它的代理人——反动王朝很清楚，它们的统治是不巩固的。美国策划要把四十多万巴勒斯坦难民驱逐至约旦南部和伊拉克山区去的阴谋，就是为了削弱约旦人民争取独立自由斗争的一支强大力量——巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人。“阿拉伯联邦”建立的目的之一，则是想依靠当时被帝国主义者认为最牢固的伊拉克费萨尔王朝，来支撑摇摇欲坠的约旦侯赛因王朝的统治。但是现在，霹雳一声，伊拉克人民取得了革命胜利，自由的旗帜在伊拉克升起了。
  “阿拉伯联邦”瓦解了。约旦人民原来也是要同伊拉克人民同时发动革命的，尽管失败了，但约旦人民举行示威游行，欢呼伊拉克兄弟的革命胜利，反对英国侵略者卷土重来，反对美英侵略者干涉伊拉克共和国的阴谋。约旦人民手中的自由旗帜还在高高举起。
