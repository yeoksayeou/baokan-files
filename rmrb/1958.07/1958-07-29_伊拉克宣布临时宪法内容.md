Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 28th: Iraqi Republic Deputy Prime Minister Arif announced the principles and contents upon which the new Iraqi provisional constitution is based on Iraqi Republic Radio on the morning of the 27th. He said that the constitution stipulates that the powers of the President of the Iraqi Republic are now held by the Supreme Power Committee. The constitution also stipulates that the orders and decrees issued after the Iraqi revolution on July 14, 1958, have legal effect.

The content of the constitution also includes: Arabs and Kurds are citizens of the Iraqi Republic; people enjoy freedom of religion except for religions that violate general morality or welfare; and the right to cultivate land is protected according to current laws, etc.

The new constitution has thirty articles.

When introducing the provisional constitution, Iraqi Republic Prime Minister Qasim said that this constitution demonstrates the foundation of the new regime before the formal constitution is drafted. He pointed out that the support of the people for the Iraqi revolution will be the best guarantee for establishing a correct constitutional life.

Qasim pointed out that all the people of Iraq know that the former so-called "fundamental law" of Iraq was drafted during the period of the mandate under the shadow of terror and violated the principles of the 1920 Iraqi revolution. He said that it is therefore necessary to abolish the former "fundamental law."

    伊拉克宣布临时宪法内容
    据新华社巴格达28日电　伊拉克共和国副总理阿里夫27日清晨在伊拉克共和国电台宣布了新的伊拉克临时宪法所依据的一些原则和内容。他说，宪法规定，伊拉克共和国总统职权现在由最高权力委员会掌握。宪法还规定，在1958年7月14日伊拉克革命以后颁布的命令和法令都具有法律效力。
    宪法的内容还有：阿拉伯人和库尔德人都是伊拉克共和国的公民；除了违反一般道德或福利的宗教以外，人民享有宗教自由；根据现行法律保护耕种土地的权利等等。
    新宪法的条文有三十条。
    伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆在介绍临时宪法时说，这个宪法表明了在正式宪法制订以前新政权的基础。他指出，伊拉克革命所得到的人民的支持将是建立正确的宪法生活的最好保证。
    卡塞姆指出，伊拉克全体人民都知道，以前伊拉克的所谓“根本法”是在恐怖阴影笼罩下的委任统治时期起草的，是违反1920年伊拉克革命的原则的。他说，因此有必要废除前“根本法”。
