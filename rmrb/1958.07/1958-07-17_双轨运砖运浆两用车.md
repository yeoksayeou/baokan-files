The cadres of the Second Construction Engineering Team of the Hongkou District Company of the Shanghai Municipal Housing Construction Company, Zhen Yongkang and worker Chen Kejia, creatively manufactured a vertical transportation device that can transport both bricks and mortar. After being modified, it can also transport materials such as cement and gravel. With this equipment, the phenomenon of manual carrying for vertical transportation on construction sites can be eliminated.

This low-cost equipment, which can replace the heavy labor of eight people, is called the dual-rail brick and mortar vehicle. (See left picture)

    双轨运砖运浆两用车
    上海市房屋修建公司虹口区公司第二营造工程队干部真永康、工人陈克家创议制造了一种垂直运输设备，可运砖又可运灰浆。它改装后还可运送水泥、石子等材料。有了这种设备，可以消灭建筑工地上垂直运输的肩挑人抬现象。
    这种造价很低、可以代替八个人笨重劳动的设备，名字叫双轨运砖运浆两用车。（见左图）
