Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Dispatch:  Workers in the manufacturing workshop of the Harbin Bearing Factory, after more than twenty days and nights of hard work, successfully trial-produced an ultra-high-speed, ultra-precision bearing at the end of June, capable of 100,000 revolutions per minute with a precision tolerance reaching five ten-thousandths.  After appraisal by the factory inspection department and the Soviet experts stationed at the factory, it was determined that the quality of the bearing has reached international standards. The successful trial production of this type of bearing marks that China's bearing industry has climbed to the peak of world technology.

This type of bearing is urgently needed for high-speed precision machine tools, high-speed instruments, and high-frequency electric grinding wheel shafts.  In the past, they were all imported from abroad. The successful trial production by the Harbin Bearing Factory will completely change this situation. This year, the factory plans to produce 150,000 sets.

The Harbin Bearing Factory has old factory buildings and outdated equipment. Originally, it was planned to begin trial production of this ultra-high-speed bearing in 1960 after expansion. However, in the technical revolution movement, the workers broke down mysterious viewpoints, with the factory director taking the lead, and with the specific assistance of Soviet experts, successfully trial-produced it using old equipment.

    超高速超精密轴承制成
    据新华社哈尔滨电  哈尔滨轴承厂制造车间职工苦战二十多个昼夜，在6月底试制成功一种每分钟十万转、精密度公差达到万分之五的超高速超精密轴承。经过工厂检查部门和驻厂苏联专家的鉴定，认为轴承的质量已经达到了国际标准。这种轴承的试制成功，标志着我国轴承工业已经攀登世界技术的顶峰。
    这种轴承是高速度精密机床、高速度仪器和高频率电动砂轮轴上迫切需要的部件，过去都是从国外进货，哈尔滨轴承厂试制成功后，将完全改变这种状况。今年这个厂计划生产十五万套。
    哈尔滨轴承厂厂房老，设备旧，本来计划在扩建后到1960年才开始试制这种超高速的轴承，但是在技术革命运动中，职工们打破了神秘观点，由厂长挂帅，在苏联专家的具体帮助下，用旧设备试制成功。
