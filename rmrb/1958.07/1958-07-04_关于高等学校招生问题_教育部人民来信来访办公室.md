    On the Issue of University Admissions
    People's Letters and Visits Office of the Ministry of Education
    Question: This year, university admissions still involve three categories of exams. Why are candidates allowed to apply across categories?
    Answer: Based on the different teaching requirements of universities and to reduce the burden on candidates in preparing for exams, university admissions are still divided into three categories according to the different nature of the majors offered by the universities. Candidates should generally apply for majors with the same exam subjects. However, considering that some candidates have broader academic aspirations, wanting to apply for both science and engineering, and medical and agricultural, or arts and history majors, if we follow the application methods of previous years, they can only apply for majors in one category, which limits the candidates' academic aspirations to a certain extent. This year, university admissions are still divided into three categories, but candidates can be allowed to apply across categories (only two categories). This approach can better accommodate the candidates' academic aspirations and give universities more choices when admitting new students. The number of schools and majors that cross-category candidates can apply for is equal to the number for non-cross-category candidates. At the same time, cross-category candidates must take the exams for the different subjects between the two categories they are crossing. For example, candidates crossing between science and engineering and agriculture and medicine should take exams in Chinese Language, Political Knowledge, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Basics of Darwinism, and Foreign Language; candidates crossing between agriculture and medicine and arts and history should take exams in Chinese Language, Political Knowledge, Physics, Chemistry, Basics of Darwinism, History, Geography, and Foreign Language; candidates crossing between arts and history and science and engineering should take exams in Chinese Language, Political Knowledge, History, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Foreign Language. In addition, if there are required additional test subjects in the applied majors, regardless of whether it is the first choice or later choices, candidates should also participate in the exams for the additional test subjects.
    Question: Why is a foreign language exam included in this year's university admissions exam? Which candidates can apply for exemption?
    Answer: In order to gradually improve the foreign language proficiency of university students and improve the quality of cadre training in universities, university admissions should include a foreign language exam. This year's regulations stipulate that this year's high school graduates must take a foreign language exam (except for this year's high school graduates in minority areas who have not studied a foreign language). The foreign language exam is divided into Russian and English, and candidates can choose either one based on what they have learned. Candidates who have not studied a foreign language can apply for exemption when applying.
    Question: How is the "cultural level equivalent to high school graduation" explained?
    Answer: The "cultural level equivalent to high school graduation" mentioned in the admission regulations refers to those who have not formally graduated from high school, but have indeed acquired a cultural level equivalent to high school graduation through self-study or tutoring; or, in terms of a certain category of subject knowledge in the university entrance examination, have already possessed a level equivalent to high school graduation.
    Question: Can primary and secondary school teachers (including private and private schools) apply?
    Answer: The issue of whether primary and secondary school teachers (including private and private schools) can apply for universities, as well as the scope of majors they can apply for, shall be determined by the education administrative departments of each province (city) and autonomous region based on local conditions.
    Question: Can students enrolled in part-time universities (correspondence and night schools) apply?
    Answer: Part-time universities are different from temporary cram schools, and their training goals are basically the same as other universities. Therefore, students enrolled in part-time universities generally should not apply, except for individual cases approved by their work units and schools.

    关于高等学校招生问题
    教育部人民来信来访办公室
    问：今年高等学校招生仍分三类考试，为什么允许考生跨类报考？
    答：根据高等学校教学上的不同要求，并且为了减轻考生温课备考的负担，高等学校招生按照高等学校所设专业的不同性质，仍分三类考试。考生一般的应当报考同一类考试科目的各专业，但是考虑到有些考生的升学志愿较广，既想报考理工类，又想报考医农类或者文史类，如果按照往年的报考办法，则只能报考某一类的专业，以致使考生的升学志愿受到一定限制。今年高等学校招生仍分三类考试，但可以允许考生跨类报考（只可报考两类），这样作，既可以更好地照顾考生的升学志愿，又可以使高等学校在录取新生时有较多的选择机会。考生跨类报考所填的志愿学校和专业数目，同不跨类考生所填的志愿学校和专业数目相等，同时，跨类考生必须参加所跨两类之间不同科目的考试。例如：跨考理工、农医两类的考生，应考试本国语文、政治常识、数学、物理、化学、达尔文主义基础、外国语等科目；跨考医农、文史两类的考生，应考试本国语文、政治常识、物理、化学、达尔文主义基础、历史、地理、外国语等科目；跨考文史、理工两类的考生，应考试本国语文、政治常识、历史、地理、数学、物理、化学、外国语等科目。此外，在报考志愿专业中遇有规定的加试科目，不论是第几志愿，还应参加加试科目的考试。
    问：今年高等学校招生考试为什么考试外国语？哪些考生可以申请免试？
    答：为了逐步提高高等学校学生的外国语水平，提高高等学校培养干部的质量，高等学校招生应该考试外国语。今年规定，本年高中毕业生必须考试外国语（少数民族地区没有学过外国语的本年高中毕业生除外），外国语考试分俄语和英语两种，由考生根据所学任选一种。对于没有学过外国语的考生，可以在报考时申请免试。
    问：相当于高中毕业的文化程度，怎样解释？
    答：招生规定中所说的相当于高中毕业的文化程度，是指没有在高中正式毕业，但是经过自修或补习确实具备了相当于高中毕业的文化程度；或者就高等学校招生考试的某一类学科知识来说，已经具备了相当于高中毕业的程度。
    问：中小学教师（包括民办、私立学校）能否报考？
    答：关于中小学教师（包括民办、私立学校）能否报考高等学校以及报考的专业范围等问题，由各省（市）、自治区教育行政部门根据当地具体情况自行规定。
    问：业余高等学校（函授和夜校）的在校学生能否报考？
    答：业余高等学校不同于临时性质的补习班，培养目标与其他高等学校基本相同。因此，业余高等学校的在校学生，一般不得报考，个别经所在工作单位和学校批准同意的除外。
                          （完）
