The Party Saved Him
—An Account of the Rescue of Qiu CaiKang, a Worker at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3
Zhai Wenwei

On the night of May 26th, three seriously injured patients were rushed to Shanghai Guangci Hospital. They were workers from the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3. During steelmaking, they were unfortunately burned by molten iron with a temperature of 1300 degrees Celsius. Among them, the furnace chief, Qiu CaiKang, suffered burns covering 89.3% of his body. This meant that his entire body, except for his scalp, arms, soles of his feet, and a narrow circle around his waist where his belt was fastened, was burned. Moreover, the vast majority were deep second-degree burns, some even penetrating into the subcutaneous layer, fascia, muscles, and even tendons.

Some doctors thought it would be impossible to save the seriously injured steelworker. They based their judgment on international medical literature, which stated that severely burned patients would die within seventy-two hours. Thus, a serious struggle between two lines unfolded around the question of whether Qiu CaiKang could be saved.

The Party Wanted to Save Him

The great rectification movement of the past year had begun to instill in the doctors' minds the concept of serving production and serving the working people. Rescuing the injured steelworkers was an unshirkable responsibility. They immediately began the rescue, washing and bandaging the patients, and administering plasma and anesthetics intravenously. However, a shadow of "despair" loomed in their hearts.

But the Party was determined to save Qiu CaiKang.

The next morning, the organization minister of the Party committee of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 rushed to Guangci Hospital and had a sincere conversation with the hospital leaders and doctors, asking them to create a medical miracle. However, they still felt that the chances were slim, and the authoritative conclusion of international medical literature was unshakeable.

An internal and external expert meeting was held that afternoon. When discussing whether to use A, C, T, H hormones for the severely injured patient, one expert openly stated: Whether this medicine is used or not, the patient will eventually die.

It was at this moment that the Party organization stood like a lighthouse on the coast, emitting light and illuminating the way.

The Party committee of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 repeatedly contacted the hospital's Party general branch, which further strengthened the Party general branch's determination to save the injured workers. The vice president and general branch secretary took personal command.

The Party general branch convened an emergency meeting of all surgical medical staff. The general branch secretary raised a series of questions at the meeting, one after another, each striking at the heart of the people: "In capitalist countries, who gets burned?" The doctors understood very well that it was always the working people who had more opportunities to get burned.

"Then, would medical experts in capitalist countries dedicate their knowledge and wisdom to saving the lives of the working people?" Did this even need to be asked? Everyone present was well aware of the treatment that working people received in hospitals before liberation, taking Guangci Hospital as an example!

The secretary asked, "Is the record in international medical literature the highest level?"

The secretary then asked, "We are a socialist country. Can't we create miracles to save the lives of heroes?"

At this moment, many people's minds were opened. They felt that the secretary had used the method of class analysis to expose the essence of capitalist countries in one sentence, and the deep-rooted superstitions in the minds of some doctors began to waver.

The secretary asked again, "Have we exhausted all our efforts and tried every means to save the lives of the injured workers?"

The Party's firm voice, like the thunder of spring, enlightened people's hearts.

He Wanted to Live for "Steel"

This is what happened the next day:

A doctor walked into the ward. Qiu CaiKang couldn't wait to ask:

"Doctor, are my eyes damaged?" "Your eyes are fine, they won't be damaged." Qiu CaiKang excitedly said to the doctor, "As long as my eyes are good, I can still watch the molten steel."

Only then did the doctors and nurses understand why he was so concerned about his eyes.

However, they themselves had been bound by layers of international medical literature and dared not boldly save a respectable person. What a stark contrast!

Qiu CaiKang's tenacious will to live inspired all the medical staff like never before!

"Heal me, I want to live!" He said this to the doctor more than once. Even in his sleep, he was still calling out steel, steel, steel!

It was precisely because of his love for the Party and the socialist cause that he wanted to live.

Qiu CaiKang, this young man of only twenty-nine years old, had experienced so much suffering in the old society! Liberation brought him happiness. He entered Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, and then transferred to Plant No. 3. In a few years, he grew from an ordinary worker into an excellent furnace chief and became a glorious Communist Party member.

This time, when people from the factory brought him his salary, the first thing he asked was, "Has the Party membership fee been paid?" When the Party secretary of the Second Medical College came to see him, he immediately realized that with the Party behind him, he would definitely be able to live. "I won't die. The Party secretary of the factory told me that I will definitely be cured! Everything must be believed in the Party."

Because he had a strong will to live, even though most of his skin was gone, his muscles were exposed, and his whole body was in excruciating pain, and he could not lie on his back, only on his stomach; and because he had no skin, the hospital adopted the exposure method, he felt cold, and his body was running a high fever, all these unimaginable pains could not break him down.

He wanted to live for the Party's cause. The Party's noble cause gave him the strength to live. When the doctor had to remove the gauze from his wounds and remove the dead tissue, the piercing pain was unbearable for anyone, and even laughing gas anesthesia could not calm him down, but he endured it, gritting his teeth. When the pain became unbearable, he needed strength to support him. He suppressed the pain and called out hopefully in a slightly trembling voice: "Chairman Mao is coming!" "Chairman Mao is coming!" Then his emotions calmed down, and he endured the pain. The doctors and nurses were strongly inspired by Qiu CaiKang's steel-like will to live. "He wants to live, why do we always think he can't live?" Yes, we must do everything possible to let him live!

The Victory of the Communist Spirit

Now, no one in Guangci Hospital believes that seriously injured steelworkers are bound to die.

Everyone cares about the condition of Qiu CaiKang and others. A condition chart was exceptionally hung near the trade union club, showing Qiu CaiKang's temperature, pulse, and breathing. People often crowded in front of the blackboard.

In order to cure the patient, people are developing their wisdom. Qiu CaiKang wanted to eat in order to live, but he couldn't eat because of his poor appetite. The nurses, based on Pavlov's theory of conditioned reflexes, read menus from various famous restaurants to him to stimulate his appetite and said to him, "Old Qiu, eat a little, you will have strength if you eat, and you will get better soon." Then they patiently put the food into his mouth and let him swallow it slowly.

Not only the hospital itself, but also brother hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and medical equipment factories were mobilized. No, all relevant parties were mobilized. As long as the doctor said something was missing, it would appear immediately. The patient needed a large amount of plasma, and Zhongshan Hospital immediately delivered it. A rare needle medicine was also brought in the fastest possible time through the cooperation of Shanghai and other local pharmaceutical companies.

At this time, the doctor wanted to perform artificial skin grafting for Qiu CaiKang. This was a way to get the patient out of danger. The director of surgery was the first to give a loud response: "Take skin from my body."

One call was answered by a hundred responses, and immediately thirty or forty doctors volunteered to donate skin.

The hospital's Party and government leaders did not grant the doctors' requests, believing that this would affect their work, so they decided to request from fraternal hospitals, hoping that the families of the deceased would donate the skin of the deceased.

The noble qualities of the steelworkers had spread, and the needed skin was quickly obtained. The family of a deceased person generously donated the skin of the deceased, saying, "Let the dead serve the heroes who are building socialism, and the dead will also feel happy."

A tense major operation. More than a dozen surgeons, under the leadership of the director, worked overnight to graft skin on Qiu CaiKang's legs. All night long, the skin grafting was successfully completed.

The battle was not over, and there were even more arduous tasks. Burn patients lying on the bed, their bodies completely relying on the mattress, would cause their bodies to rot. So, Qiu CaiKang supported himself with both hands and crawled on the bed to reduce the contact area between his body and the bed. It is impossible for a normal person to crawl in this posture for a long time; however, Qiu CaiKang, he crawled like this, and never moved for two consecutive days and nights.

The medical staff tried their best to reduce his pain and let him turn over. Each time he turned over, including anesthesia, it took fifteen people four and a half hours to work.

The doctors were thinking: There should be a bed that allows the patient to sleep in the air. For this bed, the doctors studied until late at night. Later, they found the Shanghai Medical Equipment Factory. The medical equipment factory immediately went into intense battle. The factory director, technicians, and workers studied together and thought of modifying the fracture table. They immediately transported it back to the factory from the export commodity exhibition. During the modification process, everyone worked nervously, the factory director cutting the sponge piece by piece, and the workers were busy with this and that. Finally, a special bed was sent to Guangci Hospital.

It was late at night. An old worker from the medical equipment factory who delivered the bed suddenly visited the surgeon, took out the drawings, and wanted to add a design to this special bed. And he had come all the way from his home on Linqing Road in Yangpu. In order to make Qiu CaiKang sleep more comfortably, he crossed half of Shanghai.

Such moving stories may just be small scenes, but in this great change in Guangci Hospital, they are truly countless and endless. The power of the entire society is concerned about the fate of the steelworkers and supports the rescue work of Guangci Hospital.

It has been a month since the steelworker Qiu CaiKang was burned. Now, he is stubbornly alive. He firmly believes that with the Party, he can live.

In this extraordinary struggle, there is so much rich and profound content! Wherever there is the Party, there miracles will be created.

    党救活了他
    ——记抢救上钢三厂工人丘财康的经过
    翟文蔚
    5月26日深夜，有三个伤势严重的病人被送到上海广慈医院来了。这是上钢三厂转炉车间的工人。炼钢的时候，不幸被一千三百多度高温的铁水烧伤了他们的身体。其中司炉长丘财康，烧伤面积占89.3％。这就是说，全身除了头皮、臂膀、脚底以及腰部束皮带的一个狭长的圈圈以外，全都烧伤了。而且绝大部分都是深二度的烧伤，有些甚至深入到皮下层、筋膜、肌肉以至肌腱了。
    有些医生想，要救活重伤的炼钢工人，是不可能的了。他们是根据国际医学文献来判断的：重伤病人在七十二小时以内就得死去。这样，围绕能不能救活丘财康这个问题，展开了一场严肃的两条路线的斗争。
  党要救活他
    一年来伟大的整风运动，已开始在医生们思想里树起这样的一个观念：为生产服务，为劳动人民服务。抢救受伤的炼钢工人，是义不容辞的责任。他们立刻动手抢救，为病员进行冲洗包扎、为病员切开静脉滴入血浆和麻醉剂。但是在他们心里却笼罩着一个“绝望”的阴影。
    但是，党一定要把丘财康救活。
    第二天早晨，上钢三厂的党委组织部长赶到了广慈医院，同院方领导和医生们作了一次恳切的交谈，要求他们在医疗上创造奇迹。但是他们仍然认为把握不大，国际医学文献的权威定论，是不可动摇的。
    当天下午开了一次院内外专家会议。当讨论到是否要为重伤病员使用A、C、T、H的激素时，一个专家公开表示：这种药品用也罢，不用也罢，病人终归是要死的。
    正是这样的时候，党组织像一座灯塔似地屹立在海岸，发射出光辉，照亮了道路。
    上钢三厂的党委一再和医院的党总支接触，这就进一步加强了党总支一定要救活受伤工人的决心。副院长兼总支书记亲自挂帅。
    党总支召集了外科全体医护人员，举行紧急会议。总支书在会上提出了一连串的问题，一句紧一句，句句扣着人们的心弦：“在资本主义国家里，受烧伤的是什么人？”医生们心里很明白：总是劳动人民受烧伤的机会多吧。
    “那么，资本主义国家的医学专家，会不会为了抢救劳动人民的生命而献出自己的学识和智慧？”这还用得着问？在座的人都很清楚，解放以前的医院，就拿广慈医院来说吧，劳动人民在那里受的是什么待遇！
    书记问：“国际医学文献的记载，是否就是最高水平呢？”
    书记紧接着问：“我们是社会主义国家，为了抢救英雄的生命，难道不能创造奇迹吗？”
    这时候，不少的人，脑筋开了窍。他们觉得：书记用了阶级分析的方法，一语道破了资本主义国家的本质，有些医生脑子里根深蒂固的迷信，开始动摇了。
    书记又问：“我们是不是已经尽了一切力量、想尽了一切办法，来挽救受伤工人的生命？”
    党的坚定不移的声音，就像春天的雷声一样，使人们的心豁然开朗了。
    他要为“钢”而活下去
    这是第二天发生的事情：
    一个医生走进了病房。丘财康迫不及待地问道：
    “医生，我的眼睛是不是坏了？”“你的眼睛很好，不会坏的。”丘财康对医生兴奋地说：“只要眼睛是好的就行了，我还可以看钢水。”
    医生和护士这才明白：他为什么那样关心自己的眼睛。
    然而，他们自己却曾被国际医学文献层层捆绑着，不敢大胆地去救活一个值得敬爱的人，这是何等鲜明的对比啊！
    丘财康那一股顽强的生命意志，使全体医护人员受到从所未有的感染！
    “治好我吧，我要活下去！”他不只一次地这样对医生说。甚至在睡梦中，他还是叫着钢，钢，钢！
    正是因为爱党、爱社会主义事业，他要活。
    丘财康，这个才二十九岁的青年，在旧社会经历过多少的苦难！解放，给他带来了幸福。他进了上钢一厂，然后又转到三厂。几年功夫，从一个普通工人成长为一个优秀的司炉长，成为一个光荣的共产党员。
    这次，当厂里的人替他带来薪金的时候，他第一句话就问：“党费交了没有？”当第二医学院的党委书记来看他的时候，他就马上体会到有党在他一定能够活下去。“我不会死，厂里党委书记对我说一定治好我！一切要相信党。”
    因为有着坚强的生命意志，所以即使绝大部分皮肤没有了，肌肉露在外面，全身剧痛，人不能仰睡，只能俯卧；也因为没有皮肤，医院采用暴露疗法，他感到寒冷，而体内又在发高烧，所有这些不可想像的痛苦都不能把他折磨倒。
    他要活是为了党的事业。党的崇高事业给了他生命的力量。医生要在他的创面上揭去纱布，除去坏死的组织，那种穿心的刺痛是谁也无法忍受的，连笑气麻醉也无法使他安静下来，但是他忍受着，把牙关咬得格格发响。剧痛实在难以忍受，他需要力量支持，他压制着痛苦，用微微颤抖的声音充满希望地叫着：“毛主席来啊！”“毛主席来啊！”然后情绪安定下来，把疼痛忍受过去。医生和护士们从丘财康那钢铁一般的生命意志得到了很强烈的启示。“他要活，为什么我们总认为他不能活呢？”是的，一定要千方百计让他活下去！共产主义精神的胜利
    现在，在广慈医院里再没有一个人认为受重伤的钢铁工人必然死亡的了。
    每一个人关心着丘财康等的病情。在工会俱乐部附近破例地悬挂着一块病情表，上面写着丘财康的体温、脉搏、呼吸的情况。在黑板前边经常站满了人。
    为了把病人治好，人们在发扬着智慧。丘财康为了活，要吃东西，但是因为胃口不好吃不下。护士们根据巴甫洛夫条件反射学说，把各种名牌菜馆的菜单念给他听，引起他的食欲，并且对他说：“老丘，吃一点吧，吃了就会有力气，有了力气很快就好了。”然后耐心地把食物送到他嘴巴里，让他慢慢地咽下去。
    不仅是医院本身，兄弟医院、医药公司、医疗器械厂都动起来了，不，所有有关方面都动起来了。只要医生说缺什么，就马上有什么。病人需要大量血浆，中山医院马上送到。一种稀有的针药，也通过上海和外地医药公司的协作，用最快的速度带到了。
    这时候，医生要为丘财康人工植皮。这是使病人脱离险境的一个办法。外科主任第一个发出响亮的回答：“从我身上割下皮来。”
    一呼百应，立刻就有三、四十个医生自愿捐皮。
    医院党政领导并没有答应医生们的请求，认为这会影响他们的工作，便决定向各兄弟医院要求，希望病死者的家属捐出死者的皮。
    炼钢工人的高尚品质，已经传扬开去，需要的皮很快就拿到了。一个死者的家属，慷慨地捐出了死者的皮，他说：“让死人为建设社会主义的英雄服务，死者也将感到愉快。”
    一次紧张的大手术。十几位外科医生，在主任的领导下，连夜为丘财康在腿上植皮。通宵达旦，胜利地完成了植皮工作。
    战斗并没有完，还有着更艰巨的任务。烧伤病人躺在病床上，身体完全靠着床垫，会使身体腐烂。于是，丘财康用两手撑着，爬在床上，减少身体和床的接触面积。一个正常的人，以这样的姿式爬着也不可能持久；然而，丘财康，他就这样爬着，曾经连续两天两夜没有动过。
    医护人员想尽量减轻他的痛苦，让他翻翻身。每翻一次身，连同麻醉，需要十五个人工作四个半小时。
    医生设想着：有那么一张床，可以让病人临空睡在上面。为了这张床，医生们一直研究到深夜。后来，他们找到了上海医疗器械厂。医疗器械厂立刻投入了紧张的战斗。厂长、技师、工人们一道研究，想到改装骨折台。他们立刻从出口商品展览会去把它运回厂。在改装过程中，大家都紧张地动手，厂长一块块地剪海绵，工人忙这忙那，终于一架特殊的床被送到了广慈医院。
    夜深了。医疗器械厂那个送床的老工人突然来访外科医生，拿出图纸，要为这张特殊病床增加设计。而他，是从杨树浦临青路家中远道而来的。为了让丘财康睡得更舒服些，他横穿了大半个上海。
    像这样动人的故事，也许只是一些小镜头，在广慈医院这场大变化中，真是数不尽、说不完。整个社会的力量在关心着炼钢工人的命运，在支持着广慈医院的抢救工作。
    从炼钢工人丘财康烧伤以来，已经一个月了。现在，他顽强地活着。他坚信，有了党，他就能活。
    在这一场不平凡的搏斗中，包含了多么丰富、多么深刻的内容！哪里有党，哪里就会创造奇迹。（附图片）
