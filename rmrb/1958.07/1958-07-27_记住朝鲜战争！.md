    Remember the Korean War!
    Five years ago today, on July 27, 1953, the flames of war ignited by American imperialism in Korea were extinguished. The realization of the Korean armistice was the result of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers giving the American aggressors a heavy blow, forcing them to lower their heads and admit defeat. This was a great victory for the forces of peace in their contest against the forces of war. This victory punctured the paper tiger of American imperialism, greatly encouraged the peace-loving people of the world, especially the anti-colonialist people of Asia and Africa, in their will to struggle, and at the same time disrupted America's aggressive plans to dominate the world, and helped the struggle to ease the international situation.
    However, five years later, as the Chinese People's Volunteers are proactively and regularly withdrawing from Korea in batches to create favorable conditions for breaking the deadlock in the Korean issue, British and American imperialism have once again embarked on a path of military adventurous aggression in the Middle East, launching a serious provocation against human security and world peace.
    The invasion of Lebanon and Jordan by British and American troops to carry out armed intervention in the Arab national independence movement is exactly the same as when they invaded Korea and imposed war on the Korean people. It is a nakedly piratical act that completely disregards international law and moral principles. Today, the United States falsely claims that the people of Lebanon have "invaded" Lebanon, and that the UAR's support for the Arab national independence movement poses a "threat" to the Middle East, just as it falsely claimed that the Korean people "invaded" Korea and that the Chinese people's just struggle to resist America, aid Korea, and defend their homes and country was an "aggression" against Korea. People who are fighting to win or defend national independence, especially the people of Asia and Africa, can easily see from past history and current reality that the United States is the most reactionary center of aggression and the most ferocious colonialist in the world today.
    However, the death knell of colonialism has already sounded, and imperialism is inevitably heading towards decline day by day. After the British and American invaders embarked on a path of military adventure in the Middle East, they have found that their situation is much more difficult than when they launched the Korean War. In the Korean War, the United States was able to use various means to steal the flag of the United Nations. This time, the United States is in an unprecedentedly isolated position in the United Nations organization that it has long manipulated. In the Korean War, the United States was able to drag out fifteen "allies" to provide some cannon fodder for it, but this time, even within the North Atlantic Group, many countries have expressed dissatisfaction with the British and American intervention. The British and American imperialist aggression in the Middle East has not only aroused the angry condemnation of peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and people around the world (including the people of Britain and the United States themselves), but has also been opposed by many bourgeois public opinions and some people within the ruling group in their own countries, causing a wave of panic, anxiety, and complaints. U.S. Senator Jenner directly accused: "Remember the Korean War, this is a war you cannot win."
    At the time of the Korean armistice, the Chicago Tribune in the United States also wrote melancholically in an editorial: "The United States has gained nothing in this war except for some lessons that this experiment can provide." But now it seems that the American ruling class has not even learned a "lesson." However, the people who resist aggression have drawn sufficient experience from the Korean War. The most valuable of these is that we must not be intimidated by the aggressors, and we must not have any fear of the aggressors. Only by giving them a heavy blow can they admit reality and be forced to stop. The Korean armistice did not come easily. During the long process of the Korean armistice negotiations, until the eve of the signing of the armistice agreement, the American aggressors continued to launch offensives, vainly attempting to reverse the decline and delay the realization of the armistice. Later, it was only when their last major offensive in the Kim Sung area on the central front of the Korean battlefield was met with a strong counterattack from the Korean and Chinese side, which collapsed across the board and suffered more than 40,000 casualties, that the American aggressors were forced to sign the armistice agreement. This fully shows that peace cannot be obtained by begging, but must be obtained from active struggle.
    Now, the advantage in the balance of power is no longer on the side of imperialism. Imperialists are only a small handful of people. They cannot get the support of their own people, nor can they get the sympathy of the people of the world. The people who are anti-aggression and anti-colonialism are thousands upon thousands, and the powerful socialist camp is their loyal friend. Justice is on their side, and the sympathy and support of the people of the world are also on their side. Today, we not only have the necessity but also the possibility to stop their aggression and force them to accept peace before the war that the British and American aggressors are plotting to provoke breaks out, and to withdraw their armed forces from the Middle East. The Soviet government's proposal to convene a special meeting of the Security Council attended by the heads of state of the countries concerned has been welcomed by the people of the world and the governments of many countries, and even the American government, the culprit of aggression, cannot refuse. These major efforts by the Soviet Union, coupled with the resolute struggle of the people of the world against British and American aggression and in support of the Arab people, have broken the original plan of imperialism to expand its aggression. This is the first round of victory for the forces of peace in the struggle to prevent war.
    However, the peace-loving people of the world must not relax their vigilance. After invading Lebanon and Jordan, the British and American aggressors are still constantly gathering armed forces in the Middle East. Even for holding a summit meeting within the Security Council, the United States is still creating various excuses to delay and disrupt it. Imperialist aggression can still be expanded at any time, and world peace is still in danger. Moreover, we Chinese people must not forget that the United States still occupies our Taiwan and that American troops are still赖zai [refuse to leave] in South Korea. Only by forcing British and American troops to get out of the Middle East, and only by forcing American troops to get out of Taiwan and South Korea, can the peace of the Middle East, the peace of the Far East, and the peace of the world be guaranteed.
    We love peace, but the history of 抗美援朝 [Resist America, Aid Korea] proves that if the aggressors insist on imposing war on us, we will never be afraid of war. Today, the UAR, Iraq, and the entire Arab people have expressed the same determination in the Middle East crisis. The Chinese government has solemnly warned that if the British and American aggressors do not stop their aggression, peace-loving countries and people will never stand idly by. All the relatively clear-headed people in Britain and the United States have also issued warnings not to repeat the mistakes of the Korean War and the Suez Canal War. If the British and American aggressors dare to expand the war, then they will only fail even more miserably than they did in the Korean War and the Suez Canal War. Where to go, the time has come for the British and American aggressors to make a calm choice.

### 记住朝鲜战争！

    记住朝鲜战争！
    五年前的今天，1953年7月27日，美帝国主义在朝鲜点起的战火被扑灭了。朝鲜停战的实现，是朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军给了美国侵略者以沉重打击、使它不得不低下头来承认失败的结果。这是和平力量在同战争力量的较量中赢得的一次伟大胜利。这个胜利，戳穿了美帝国主义这只纸老虎，大大鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民，尤其是反殖民主义的亚非各国人民的斗争意志，同时打乱了美国称霸世界的侵略计划，帮助了争取缓和国际局势的斗争。
    但是，五年后的现在，当中国人民志愿军正在主动地定期分批撤出朝鲜、为打开朝鲜问题僵局创造有利条件的时候，美英帝国主义在中东又走上了军事冒险的侵略道路，再一次向人类安全和世界和平发动了严重的挑衅。
    美英军队侵入黎巴嫩和约旦，对阿拉伯民族独立运动进行武装干涉，正同当年它们侵入朝鲜、把战争强加于朝鲜人民头上一样，完全是无视国际公法和道义准则的赤裸裸的海盗行径。美国今天诬称黎巴嫩人民“侵略”了黎巴嫩，阿联对于阿拉伯民族独立运动的声援和支持造成了对于中东的“威胁”，正同当年诬称朝鲜人民“侵略”了朝鲜，中国人民抗美援朝、保家卫国的正义斗争是对朝鲜的“侵略”一样，也完全是掩饰它自己的侵略行动的无耻借口。正在为争取或捍卫民族独立而斗争的人民、特别是亚非各国人民，都不难从过去的历史和当前的现实看出，美国是今天世界上最反动的侵略势力中心和最凶恶的殖民主义者。
    但是，殖民主义的丧钟已经响了，帝国主义正在不可避免地一天天地走向没落。美英侵略者在中东踏上军事冒险道路之后，已经发现它们的处境要比发动侵略朝鲜战争时期困难得多。在朝鲜战争中，美国还能利用各种手段，盗用联合国的旗帜。而这一次，美国在它曾经长期操纵的联合国组织中，处境也空前孤立。在朝鲜战争中，美国还能拖出十五个“盟国”来替它提供一些炮灰，而这一次，甚至北大西洋集团内部，许多国家也都表示不满意美英的干涉行动。美英帝国主义侵略中东的行为不仅引起了全世界爱好和平、维护正义的国家和人民的愤怒谴责（包括美英本国人民），而且在本国许多资产阶级舆论和统治集团内部一部分人中间也遭到了反对，引起了一片惊恐、忧虑和抱怨。美国参议员詹纳尔就曾直截了当地指责说：“记住朝鲜战争，这是个你不能打胜的战争”。
    朝鲜停战的当时，美国芝加哥论坛报在社论里也曾忧郁地写道：“美国在这次战争中，除去获得了这次试验所能提供的一些教训以外，什么也没有赢得”。但是现在看来，美国统治阶级连“教训”也没有赢得。但是，反抗侵略的人民，从朝鲜战争中却吸取了充分的经验。其中最宝贵的一条，就是不能让侵略者吓住，不能对侵略者有任何畏缩，只有给他们以狠狠的打击，才能使他们承认现实，被迫住手。朝鲜停战并不是容易得来的。在朝鲜停战谈判的漫长过程中，直到停战协定签定前夕，美国侵略者一直不断发动攻势，妄想挽回颓势，拖延停战的实现。以后只是当他们最后在朝鲜战场的中线金城地区发动的一次大攻势遭到朝中方面的坚强反击，全线崩溃，损失四万多人以后，美国侵略者才被迫在停战协定上签字。这充分说明，和平不能靠乞求得来，必须从积极的斗争中才能获得。
    现在，力量对比的优势，已经不在帝国主义一面。帝国主义者只是一小撮人。他们既得不到本国人民的支持，也得不到世界各国人民的同情。而反侵略反殖民主义的人民却是千千万万，强大的社会主义阵营是他们忠实的朋友。正义在他们这一面，世界人民的同情和支持也在他们这一面。今天，我们不但有必要而且有可能，在美英侵略者阴谋挑起的战争爆发以前，就制止他们的侵略，迫使他们接受和平，并且把武装力量撤出中东。苏联政府建议召开由有关国家首脑出席的安理会特别会议，已经获得全世界人民和许多国家政府的欢迎，连侵略的祸首美国政府也无法拒绝。苏联的这些重大努力，加上全世界人民反对美英侵略、支持阿拉伯人民的坚决斗争，已经打破了帝国主义扩大侵略的原定计划。这是和平力量在制止战争的斗争中取得的第一个回合的胜利。
    但是，世界爱好和平的人民绝对不能放松警惕。美英侵略者在侵占黎巴嫩和约旦之后，仍然不断地向中东地区集结武装力量。就是对于在安理会内举行首脑会议，美国也还在制造种种借口，拖延捣乱。帝国主义的侵略行动仍然随时可以扩大，世界和平仍然处于危险之中。而且，我们中国人民更不能忘记美国还占领着我国的台湾，美国军队还赖在南朝鲜。只有迫使美英军队从中东滚出去，只有迫使美国军队从台湾、从南朝鲜滚出去，中东的和平、远东的和平和世界的和平才有保证。
    我们爱好和平，但是抗美援朝的历史证明，如果侵略者硬把战争强加在我们头上，我们也决不害怕战争。今天阿联、伊拉克以及整个阿拉伯人民在中东危机中已经表示了同样的决心。中国政府已经庄严地提出警告，如果美英侵略者不停止他们的侵略活动，爱好和平的国家和人民绝不会袖手旁观。美英国内一切头脑比较清醒的人也提出了不要重犯朝鲜战争和苏伊士运河战争的错误的警告。如果美英侵略者敢于扩大战争，那么他们只会比在朝鲜战争和苏伊士运河战争中失败得更惨。何去何从，该是美英侵略者冷静抉择的时候了。
