	Emphasize the Role of People
	Liang Ying
	Currently, it is the fastest growing season for crops, and whether the field management is done well is a crucial key to strive for a great harvest in the fall. Many regions are trying every means to take measures to strengthen field management. However, among cadres and the masses in some areas, there is a "predetermination theory." They say, "When the yellow seedlings are planted, thirty percent of the harvest is in the bag." Once crops grow to a certain extent, regardless of whether the seedlings grow well or not, production is considered settled, and adding more measures will have no effect. They become blindly complacent when they see that the crops are growing well; they become pessimistic when they see that the crops are growing poorly. Whether it is complacency or pessimism, the result is the same: relaxation of field management, which in turn will affect crop yields.
	The reason why the "predetermination theory" is wrong is that it ignores the subjective initiative of people, seeing only things and not people. They regard things as immutable, good seedlings always good, and bad seedlings always bad. In fact, everything is constantly developing and changing. If field management is relaxed, good seedlings can turn into bad seedlings; if field management is strengthened, bad seedlings can turn into good seedlings. Therefore, what determines the growth of seedlings is people, not the seedlings themselves.
	This year, China's wheat has achieved a bumper harvest under very severe drought conditions. Some places (such as Hebei) have not had a thorough rain from sowing to harvesting. According to the logic of the "predetermination theory," this year's wheat should have been a poor harvest. But it is not the case. This year, China's wheat has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. What is the reason? Isn't it the result of the vast number of peasants, under the leadership of the Party, giving full play to their soaring enthusiasm, believing that man can conquer nature, and waging a resolute struggle against various natural disasters! This shows that conditions can be changed and created. Look at the people of Nongan County, Jilin, who, starting in late June, launched a major campaign to upgrade second and third-class seedlings. By July 8, statistics showed that more than 48,000 hectares of second and third-class seedlings in the county had been upgraded to first-class seedlings, and the remaining 10,000 hectares of third-class seedlings were also about to be eliminated. Look again at the Tuanjie Agricultural Cooperative in Jianshe Township, Jiangpu County, Jiangsu, which originally had more than 200 mu of third-class seedlings. After fifteen days of intensive work, more than 100 mu have surpassed first-class seedlings and reached the level of seedlings in experimental fields, and the remaining 100 mu are about to reach the level of seedlings in experimental fields. These facts show that the "predetermination theory" is unfounded. Once the subjective initiative of the people is brought into play, it can generate infinite power, eliminate all difficulties, and constantly push production to new heights.

    要重视人的作用
    梁颖
    目前正是农作物生长最快的时期，田间管理做得好坏，对争取秋季大丰收是个重要的关键。许多地区正在千方百计地采取措施，加强田间管理。但在一部分地区的干部和群众中，却存在一种“定局论”。他们说：“黄秧落地三分收”，庄稼长到一定程度，不管禾苗长得好坏，生产就算定了局，再增加措施，也没有什么作用。他们看到庄稼长得较好，就盲目自满起来；看到庄稼长得不好，又产生悲观情绪。不管是自满或悲观，结果只有一个：放松了田间管理，从而也就会影响庄稼的收成。
    “定局论”所以是错误的，就在于他们忽视了人们的主观能动作用，只见物，不见人。他们把事物看成是一成不变，好苗永远是好的，坏苗永远是坏的。其实，一切事物都在不断地发展、变化着。放松了田间管理，好苗可以变成坏苗；加强了田间管理，坏苗可以变成好苗。因此，决定禾苗生长情况的是人，不是苗。
    今年我国小麦是在非常严重的干旱情况下获得丰收的，有些地方（如河北）从播种到收割，一直没有下过透雨。按照“定局论”者的逻辑，今年小麦非歉收不可了。但是不然，我国今年的小麦却获得了空前的大丰收。什么原故？还不是广大农民在党的领导下，发挥了冲天的干劲，相信人定胜天，向各种自然灾害进行了坚决的斗争的结果吗！这说明条件是可以改变的，也是能够创造的。请看吉林农安县人民，他们从6月下旬开始向二、三类苗大进军，到7月8日统计，全县已有四万八千多公顷二、三类苗升为一类苗，其余一万多公顷三类苗也即将消灭。再看江苏江浦县建设乡团结农业社，原来该社有二百多亩三类苗，经过十五天的突击加工，已有一百多亩超过一类苗，达到试验田秧苗的水平，其余一百多亩即将达到试验田秧苗。这些事实说明，“定局论”者是没有根据的，人民群众的主观能动性一经发挥，就能产生无穷无尽的力量，可以排除一切困难，把生产不断推向新的高潮。
