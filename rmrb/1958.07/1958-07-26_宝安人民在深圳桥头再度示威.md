Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 25th. People from Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, held a demonstration at the Shenzhen Bridge near Hong Kong on the 23rd, which was larger than the one on the 20th, strongly protesting against the armed aggression of the American and British imperialists in the Middle East.

　　For several days, residents near Shenzhen have been constantly gathering in groups to demonstrate against the British police in Hong Kong at the Shenzhen Bridge. The large demonstration on the 23rd was the peak of the mass demonstration movement in recent days. On that day, about 4,000 people from Bao'an County, holding up protest slogans, gathered at the Shenzhen Bridge to demonstrate. They shouted slogans at the British police on the opposite side, such as "American and British aggressors get out of the Middle East!" and "British aggressors get out of Jordan!"

　　Cargo worker He Zhu stood at the front of the demonstration. One hand held a red banner with the words "American and British troops get out of the Middle East," and the other hand clenched his fist and shouted slogans. He did not forget the oppression of Chinese workers by British imperialism in the past. In 1952, he was brutally beaten by British police in Hong Kong and handcuffed. Later, his fellow workers rushed to surround the British police station and rescued him. He participated in the demonstration on the 23rd despite his illness. Cai Huoda, a seventy-two-year-old farmer, asked someone to help him to Shenzhen Railway Station, and then, leaning on his crutches, shouted slogans with the demonstrators. He did not want the people of the Middle East to suffer the pain of imperialist aggression. Although he suffered from severe rheumatism in his legs, he resolutely participated in the demonstration. Among the demonstrators was Zhang Yalan, the cousin of Zhang Tianxiang, a farmer who was unreasonably shot and killed by British police ten years ago. She brought the clothes left by Zhang Tianxiang when she participated in the demonstration.

    宝安人民在深圳桥头再度示威
    新华社广州25日电　广东省宝安县人民23日在临近香港的深圳桥头举行了比20日规模更大的示威游行，强烈抗议美英帝国主义对中东的武装侵略。
    一连几天，深圳附近的居民就成群结队终日不断地到深圳桥头向香港的英国警察示威，23日的大示威是几天来群众示威运动的高峰。当天，宝安县约有四千群众高举着抗议的标语，汇集到深圳桥头举行示威，他们向对面的英方警察高呼“美英侵略军滚出中东去！”“英国侵略军滚出约旦去！”的口号。
    搬运工人何珠站在示威队伍的最前面，他一只手拉着“美英军队滚出中东”的红布横额，一只手紧握着拳头高呼口号。他没有忘记英帝国主义过去对中国工人的压迫。1952年他在香港曾被英国警察蛮横殴打，并且被铐上手铐，后来工友们闻讯赶去包围英国的警察局，才把他救了出来。23日他带病参加了示威。七十二岁的老农蔡火达，叫人搀着到深圳车站，然后自己拄着拐杖，和示威的人群一起高呼口号。他不愿意中东人民也受到帝国主义侵略的痛苦，虽然他两腿患着严重的风湿病，也坚决参加了示威。在示威的队伍中，还有十年前被英国警察无理枪杀的农民张添祥的堂妹张亚兰。她在参加示威的时候还带着张添祥遗下的衣服。
