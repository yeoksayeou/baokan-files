    Advocating for Reform of Funeral Customs
    The article "Reform Funeral Customs, Advocate Cremation and Simple Burials with Graves but No Mounds" written by Comrade Zhao Jianmin, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, published on page 4 of the People's Daily on June 17th, expresses the wishes of many people. As someone who has personally experienced the pain of old funeral customs, I would like to share my own feelings on this matter.
    My father and grandfather passed away in 1953 and 1956 respectively, and I personally handled all funeral arrangements at that time. Although my ideological understanding has improved a lot in the years since liberation, if the funeral was handled too simply, I would inevitably be criticized by some conservatives. Therefore, I had to bite the bullet and buy coffins and burial garments. After the funeral was completed, a series of financial difficulties arose, which in turn increased the mental burden and also affected my work.
    The benefits of the method advocated by Comrade Zhao Jianmin are that it not only expands cultivated land area and facilitates irrigation, saves wood, but also alleviates the financial hardship and mental burden caused by funerals, enabling people to participate in socialist construction more happily.
    I hope that each province can propose some measures for reforming funeral customs that are adapted to local conditions, just like Shandong Province.

### 拥护改革丧葬礼俗

    拥护改革丧葬礼俗
    6月17日人民日报四版上发表的中共山东省委书记处书记赵健民同志写的“改革丧葬礼俗，提倡废棺薄葬墓而不坟”一文，说出了很多人的心愿。作为一个饱尝过旧的丧葬礼俗的痛苦的人，愿谈谈这方面的亲身感受。
    我的父亲、祖父先后于1953年和1956年病故，当时一切丧葬礼事均由我一人亲手办理。虽然解放几年来我的思想觉悟有了不少提高，但办理丧事如果太简单，总要受到一些守旧派的舆论责难。因此只得硬着头皮买棺木、买寿衣。丧事办理完毕，生活却发生了一系列的困难，随之而来加重了精神上的负担，也影响了工作。
    赵健民同志所提倡的办法的好处是：不但能扩大耕地面积便利耕灌，节约木材，更能减轻人们因办丧事而造成的生活困难和精神上的负担，使他们更愉快地参加社会主义建设。
    我希望各个省，能像山东省一样，提出一些因地制宜的改革丧葬礼俗的办法来。
