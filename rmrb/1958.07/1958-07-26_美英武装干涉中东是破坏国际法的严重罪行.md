US-British Armed Intervention in the Middle East is a Serious Crime of Violating International Law
Zhou Gengsheng
    After the Iraqi people overthrew the feudal dynasty and established the Republic of Iraq on July 14, US and British imperialism sent troops to Lebanon and Jordan one after another to support the corrupt regimes in these two Arab countries that were about to be overthrown by the people, regimes that had betrayed their national interests. This action by the US-British imperialist bloc is an armed intervention in the internal affairs of these two countries and is essentially an act of aggression. The armed intervention by the US and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan poses a threat to the newly established Republic of Iraq and the national independence of the entire Arab world, thereby endangering peace in the Middle East and even the world. This is obviously intolerable to all peace-loving countries and people in the world. All legal workers in the world should, in the spirit of law serving justice and peace, unite to solemnly expose the extreme illegality and aggressive nature of this intervention by US-British imperialism, and not allow them to evade their responsibility for aggression under any pretext.
    First, the US-British imperialism sending troops to "save" governments opposed by the people of Lebanon and Jordan is a blatant violation of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. Non-interference in internal affairs is a universally recognized basic principle of international law. This principle, based on the principles of national sovereignty and national self-determination, guarantees the right of the people of all countries to decide their own destiny and choose their own government, and this right must not be deprived by any external force. The principle of non-interference was a democratic principle striven for by the French bourgeois democratic revolution, and the United States firmly rejected all foreign interference in its Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century (the American Civil War). Now the rulers of the United States brazenly collude with Britain to send troops to interfere in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Jordan, what a shameful act this is! This US-British armed intervention in Arab countries cannot but remind people of similar evil examples in Western history, especially the intervention of the despotic monarchs of Prussia and Austria in the French Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century, the intervention of the Holy Alliance in the revolutions of European countries in the first half of the nineteenth century, the intervention of British, French, American, and Japanese imperialism in Soviet Russia after the end of World War I, and the armed intervention of the two fascist regimes of Germany and Italy in Spain in 1936. The armed intervention currently being carried out by US-British imperialism in the Middle East is a repetition of those evil examples in history, thus proving that they are unreserved inheritors of the extremely reactionary traditions of the West.
    The armed intervention by US-British imperialism in Lebanon and Jordan not only violates universally recognized principles of international law, but also violates the principles of the United Nations Charter. Article 2, paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter stipulates: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state..." This means that the United Nations shall not interfere in the internal affairs of member states. A view has emerged from the US-British imperialist side that the provisions of Article 2 of the United Nations Charter refer to the fact that the United Nations shall not interfere in internal affairs, but not that member states shall not interfere in internal affairs. This argument is extremely absurd! In fact, this provision of the Charter emphasizes the binding force of the principle of non-interference, and denies both collective and individual interference.
    Second, the US-British imperialism sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan violates the principle of not infringing upon the territory and independence of other countries by force. This principle is one of the most important principles of the United Nations Charter, and it is also a solemn international obligation undertaken by member states. Article 2, paragraph 4 of the United Nations Charter stipulates: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations." The United States sending troops to Lebanon and Britain sending troops to Jordan obviously infringes upon the territory and independence of these countries by force and violates the United Nations Charter. The United States and Britain are major powers participating in the United Nations Security Council and bear special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. However, they are the first to violate this most important principle in the United Nations Charter, which is the most unforgivable thing.
    Third, US-British imperialism not only violates the principles of the United Nations Charter themselves, but they also force the United Nations to violate these principles. They requested the United Nations to send "police forces" to Lebanon and Jordan to stabilize the local governments that are opposed by the people. It is not difficult to see that US-British imperialism is attempting to use the United Nations to send troops to legitimize their own troop deployments and force the United Nations itself to interfere in the internal affairs of member states. In this way, the United Nations itself will fall into a situation of violating the provisions of Article 2 of the Charter.
    Finally, the action of armed intervention in internal affairs and infringing upon the independence of other countries by US-British imperialism obviously constitutes an act of aggression. The people of Lebanon and Jordan who are subjected to aggression have full rights to demand that the United Nations take action to stop it; the United Nations also has an obligation to take action to stop US-British aggression.
    In order to cover up their actions this time, US-British imperialism has come up with some distorted reasons as the legal basis for their troop deployments. These reasons were first put forward in Eisenhower's speech and message to Congress when the United States sent troops to Lebanon; Britain also listed these reasons when it sent troops to Jordan. They also put forward the so-called "indirect aggression." These reasons are all unfounded and are actually not worth refuting. However, because the US-British bloc is attempting to use this to deceive public opinion, these arguments must be clarified.
    The first reason put forward by US-British imperialism is that the troop deployments in Lebanon and Jordan are in response to the "urgent requests" of the governments of the two countries; they hope to use this as a legal basis for the troop deployments. The statement that intervention in response to the request of a legitimate government is legitimate is entirely to defend helping foreign reactionary governments suppress the people's forces. This was originally a statement made by feudal autocratic monarchs during the bourgeois democratic revolutions in Western countries in order to request foreign forces to suppress domestic bourgeois democratic revolutionary movements. Even international law scholars representing bourgeois democracy and liberalism in the second half of the nineteenth century opposed this statement. For example, British international law scholar Hall refuted this doctrine extremely resolutely, and Lawrence also opposed this doctrine. Domestic disputes in a country should ultimately be determined by its people, and the people of any country have the right to determine their own destiny and choose their own government. This principle is also stated in the North American Declaration of Independence. Therefore, interfering in the internal affairs of a country is infringing upon the independence of the intervened country and infringing upon the people's right to choose their own government. A government that is not supported by the people, when a civil war or revolution breaks out in its country and it has to ask for foreign help to maintain its rule, the legitimacy of this government itself becomes questionable, because it can no longer represent its people. In this case, foreign intervention, especially armed intervention, is obviously a blatant deprivation of the people's right to decide their own internal affairs. The Chamoun government in Lebanon is tottering, and the Jordanian dynasty is in imminent danger. In order to maintain their reactionary rule, these anti-people regimes do not hesitate to sell out the country's independence and request foreign intervention. This request itself is illegal, how can it be used as a legitimate basis for US-British imperialism to send troops to intervene? Eisenhower said in his message to Congress that it was to "help the Lebanese government defend Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity." In fact, the fact of US armed intervention is a blatant violation of Lebanon's independence.
    The second reason for US-British imperialism sending troops is to protect the lives and property of their nationals in Lebanon and Jordan. There is no basis in international law for sending troops to protect nationals. Although individual reactionary bourgeois scholars such as the British Oppenheim listed the protection of nationals as one of the six reasons for "intervention based on rights" in his international law textbook, this is entirely to defend imperialist gunboat diplomacy and is not endorsed by general scholarship. As the Soviet Union pointed out in its statement on the Middle East issue on July 16: The so-called protection of nationals has always been a pretext used by all colonialists to launch predatory attacks on small countries. As is well known, Western imperialism has repeatedly used force against old China under the pretext of protecting nationals and carried out aggression. US imperialism's armed intervention in Latin American countries under the pretext of protecting the lives and property of nationals is even more commonplace. However, even the American bourgeois international law scholar Borchard, in his book "Diplomatic Protection of Citizens Abroad," cannot but believe that intervention on the grounds of protecting nationals is an infringement on the sovereignty of the occupied country. The draft definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet Union at the Disarmament Conference convened by the League of Nations in 1933 specifically pointed out that "the possible danger to the lives or property of foreigners" cannot be used as a pretext for armed intervention, which correctly reflects the recognized norms of international conduct. The US-British imperialism's pretext of protecting nationals cannot cover up the crimes of aggression they have committed.
    Any country has the right to protect its nationals, but it generally does so through diplomatic means, and can also evacuate its nationals on its own when necessary. In fact, American nationals in Lebanon were not threatened in any way, and Dulles himself admitted this. If US and British nationals were indeed threatened, the US and Britain would only have to evacuate their nationals on their own, and there would be absolutely no reason to carry out armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan.
    The third reason put forward by US-British imperialism is that the troop deployments are exercising the right of collective self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. This is a malicious distortion of the Charter. Article 51 of the United Nations Charter refers to self-defense against armed attack. Armed attack is external, while the armed uprising in Lebanon is entirely a matter of internal affairs. The report submitted by the observers dispatched by the United Nations also clearly stated that there was no infiltration of foreign elements within Lebanon. Moreover, even if foreign elements voluntarily participate, it does not constitute armed attack. Everyone remembers that the American Revolutionary War was attended by volunteer troops composed of many foreigners. They were not considered "aggressors." Anyone has the right to express sympathy and support for foreign revolutions. Can this kind of sympathy and support be said to be armed attack or threat? Obviously, the US-British imperialism's citation of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter is untenable. Because, since there is no armed attack, there is no question of self-defense at all. Can it be said that the domestic people's opposition to their own government constitutes a threat to their country's independence?
    In addition to the above three reasons, US-British imperialism also put forward the so-called "indirect aggression." Their definition of "indirect aggression" is "under the guise of chaotic civil war, allowing those who are truly loyal to the aggressors to come to power in the country." This is obviously a subjective and arbitrary statement. Where exactly is the so-called "indirect aggression" manifested? What "indirect aggression" have Lebanon and Jordan suffered? The US-British aggressors have not been able to provide any factual basis. If one can arbitrarily fabricate some "indirect aggression" as a pretext for sending troops, imperialism can carry out armed intervention in all national independence movements and national revolutionary actions in the world that do not suit their tastes. This argument cannot be found in any international law. In fact, the US-British are trying to fabricate indirect aggression by others to cover up their own direct aggression.
    The political motivation for US-British imperialism sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan is that the success of the Iraqi revolution has "fundamentally changed the situation" and shaken their colonial rule in the Middle East. They themselves have already admitted this without being forced to confess. The so-called reasons they put forward are just excuses. Eisenhower's Middle East policy has failed, and US-British imperialist forces are facing a complete collapse in the Middle East. Sending troops is their desperate act. US imperialism has always hypocritically worn the cloak of sympathy for anti-colonialism and infiltrated colonial or semi-colonial areas all over the world, replacing the forces of British and French imperialism. This time, in order to urgently save its bankrupt Eisenhower Doctrine, it did not hesitate to take off the cloak of anti-colonialism and launch the most vicious armed intervention. British imperialism also cooperated with the United States in sending troops. This action by the US-British aggressors not only undermines the independence of Lebanon and Jordan, which are directly invaded, and threatens the security of the Republic of Iraq, but also constitutes a blatant provocation to the people of Arab countries and seriously threatens peace in the Middle East and the world. This action by US-British imperialism is undeniably a blatant violation of international law and is being unanimously condemned by the broad masses of people all over the world. They bear inescapable responsibility for their crimes of aggression.

    美英武装干涉中东是破坏国际法的严重罪行
    周鲠生
    伊拉克人民在7月14日推翻了封建王朝、建立了伊拉克共和国以后，美英帝国主义即先后出兵黎巴嫩和约旦，支持这两个阿拉伯国家内快要被人民推翻的、出卖民族利益的腐败的政权。美英帝国主义集团这种行动是对于这两国的内政进行武装干涉，实质上就是侵略行为。美英两国对黎巴嫩和约旦进行这种武装干涉，形成对新成立的伊拉克共和国以及整个阿拉伯世界民族独立的威胁，从而危及中东地区乃至全世界的和平。这显然是世界上所有爱好和平的国家和人民所不能容忍的。全世界法律工作者，都应该本着法律为正义、和平服务的精神，一道起来严正地揭破美英帝国主义这种干涉行动的极端非法性和它的侵略本质，而不容许它们以任何借口来逃避侵略罪责。
    首先，美英帝国主义出兵“拯救”受黎巴嫩和约旦人民反对的政府，是粗暴地破坏不干涉内政的原则。不干涉内政是公认的国际法基本原则之一。这个原则从国家主权和民族自决原则出发，保障各国人民自己决定自己的命运、选择自己的政府的权利，而这个权利是决不容许任何外力来剥夺的。不干涉原则早已是法兰西资产阶级民主革命力争的一个民主原则，美国在十九世纪中期的内战（南北战争）中就坚决拒绝了外国一切的干涉。现在美国的统治者却悍然伙同英国出兵干涉黎巴嫩、约旦的内政，这是何等可耻的行为！美英这次对阿拉伯国家进行武装干涉，不能不令人回想西方历史上一些类似的恶例，特别是十八世纪末期普奥两国专制帝王出兵干涉法兰西革命，十九世纪上半期神圣同盟出兵干涉欧洲国家的革命，第一次世界大战结束后英法美日帝国主义出兵苏俄，以及1936年德意两个法西斯政权对西班牙的武装干涉。美英帝国主义现今在中东进行的武装干涉正是上述历史上那些恶例的重复，从而证明它们是西方极端反动传统的不折不扣的继承者。
    美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦进行的武装干涉，不但破坏了公认的国际法原则，也违背了联合国宪章的原则。联合国宪章第二条第七款规定：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件……”意即联合国不得干涉会员国的内政。美英帝国主义方面出现一种论调说联合国宪章第二条的规定是指联合国不得干涉内政，而不是会员国不得干涉内政，这种论调真是荒谬之极！其实宪章这一规定正是强调不干涉原则的拘束力，把集体干涉同个别干涉一并否认了。
    其次，美英帝国主义出兵黎巴嫩和约旦是违犯了不以武力侵犯别国的领土和独立的原则。而这个原则是联合国宪章的一个最重要的原则，也就是会员国承担的一个庄严的国际义务。联合国宪章第二条第四款规定：“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立”。美国出兵黎巴嫩、英国出兵约旦显然是以武力侵犯了这些国家的领土和独立，是违反联合国宪章的。美英是参加联合国安全理事会的大国，对维持国际和平和安全特别负有责任，然而它们首先破坏了联合国宪章中这个最重要的原则，那是最不可饶恕的。
    再次，美英帝国主义不仅自己破坏了联合国宪章的原则，它们还强迫联合国也来破坏这些原则。它们请求联合国派遣“警察部队”到黎巴嫩和约旦来稳定当地为人民所反对的政府。不难看出，美英帝国主义是企图利用联合国派遣部队来使自己出兵合法化，并且迫使联合国本身干涉会员国内政。这样，联合国自己也就陷入违反宪章第二条的规定的境地了。
    最后，美英帝国主义这种武装干涉内政，侵害他国独立的行动显然构成侵略行为，受到侵略的黎巴嫩和约旦人民有充分权利要求联合国采取行动，予以制止；联合国也有义务采取行动制止美英侵略。
    美英帝国主义为了掩饰它们这次的行为，却搬出了一些歪曲的理由作为它们出兵的法律根据，这些理由首先是在美国出兵黎巴嫩时艾森豪威尔发表的演说以及向国会作的咨文中提出的；英国出兵约旦时也同样列举了这些理由。它们并且提出了所谓“间接侵略”。这些理由都无任何根据，实际上并不值一驳。但由于美英集团企图以此欺骗舆论，因此必须对这方面论点加以澄清。
    美英帝国主义提出的第一个理由是：出兵黎巴嫩和约旦是应两国政府的“紧急请求”；它们希图以此作为出兵的合法根据。所谓应合法政府的请求的干涉是合法的这种说法，完全是为帮助外国反动政府镇压人民力量作辩护。这原来是西方国家资产阶级民主革命时期的封建专制君主为了请求外力镇压国内资产阶级民主革命运动而提出的一种说法。对于这种说法，即使是代表十九世纪后半期资产阶级民主自由主义的国际法学者也是反对的。如英国国际法学家霍尔对这种学说驳斥得极为坚决，劳伦斯也反对这一学说。一国发生国内纷争最后应取决于它们的人民，任何一个国家的人民都有权决定自己的命运，选择自己的政府。这一原则在北美独立宣言中也有表明。所以，干涉一国的内政就是侵犯被干涉国的独立，侵犯人民选择自己的政府的权利。一个不受人民支持的政府，当它国内发生内战或革命而不得不请求外国帮助以维持自己的统治时，这一政府的合法性本身就成问题，因为它已不能代表它的人民。在这种情况下，外国进行干涉，尤其是武装干涉，显然是粗暴地剥夺人民决定本国内政的权利。黎巴嫩的夏蒙政府摇摇欲坠，约旦王朝朝不保夕，这种反人民的政权为了保持它们的反动统治，不惜出卖国家的独立，请求外力干涉，这种请求本身就是非法的，如何能作为美英帝国主义出兵干涉的合法根据？艾森豪威尔在国会咨文中说是为了“帮助黎巴嫩政府保卫黎巴嫩的主权和领土完整”，其实美国进行武装干涉的事实倒是公然破坏黎巴嫩的独立。
    美英帝国主义出兵的第二个理由说是为了保护它们在黎巴嫩和约旦的侨民的生命和财产。为了保侨而出兵，在国际法上是找不出任何根据的。尽管有个别资产阶级的反动学者如英国的奥本海在他的国际法教本中把保护侨民列为六种“根据权利的干涉”的理由之一，但是这完全是为帝国主义的炮舰政策作辩护，并不是一般学说所赞同的。如苏联在7月16日就中东事件发表的声明中所指出：所谓保护侨民向来就是一切殖民主义者惯于用来向小国进行掠夺性进攻的口实。如所周知，西方帝国主义曾经多次以保侨为借口对旧中国使用武力，进行侵略。美帝国主义对于拉丁美洲国家以保护侨民生命财产为借口进行武装干涉，更是司空见惯的事。然而，就是美国资产阶级的国际法学家博查德在他所著的“对海外侨民的外交保护”一书中也不能不认为以保侨为由的干涉，是对被占领国家的主权的一种侵害。1933年苏联在国际联盟召集的裁军会议上提出的侵略定义案，特别指明“对外国人生命或财产的可能危险”不能当做武装干涉的借口，这是正确地反映了公认的国际行为的准则的。美英帝国主义的保侨的借口绝不能掩盖它们所犯下的侵略罪行。
    任何一个国家有权保护自己的侨民，但一般是通过外交方法，必要的时候还可以自动撤侨。事实上，美国侨民在黎巴嫩并未受到任何威胁，杜勒斯本人也承认了这一点。如果美英侨民果真受到威胁，美英也只有自行撤侨，而完全没有理由对黎巴嫩和约旦进行武装干涉。
    美英帝国主义提出的第三个理由是：出兵是根据联合国宪章第五十一条的规定实行集体自卫权。这完全是对宪章的一种恶意的曲解。联合国宪章第五十一条的规定是指对付武装进攻的自卫，武装进攻是外来的，而黎巴嫩的武装起义完全是内政问题。联合国派遣的观察员所提出的报告也清楚地说到黎巴嫩内部并无外来分子的渗入。况且即使有外来分子志愿参加，也并不构成武装进攻。谁都记得，美国的独立战争就有由许多外国人组成的志愿军参加。他们并没有被认为是“侵略者”。任何个人都有对外国革命表示同情支援的权利。难道可以把这种同情支援说成是武装进攻或威胁吗？显然美英帝国主义引用联合国宪章第五十一条是站不住脚的。因为，既然不存在任何武装进攻，根本谈不上甚么自卫了。难道能说国内人民反对本国政府即构成对它们国家独立的威胁吗？
    除了上述三点理由以外，美英帝国主义还提出了所谓“间接侵略”。他们的“间接侵略”的定义是“在纷乱的内战的掩饰下，让那些真正忠于侵略者的人在国内当权”。这显然是主观武断的说法。所谓的“间接侵略”究竟表现在那里，黎巴嫩和约旦受到什么“间接侵略”，美英侵略者没有能提出任何事实的根据。如果可以任意捏造什么“间接侵略”作为出兵口实，帝国主义就可以对世界上发生的不合自己口味的一切民族独立运动和民族革命行动进行武装干涉。这种论点在任何国际法中都是找不到根据的。实际上美英是企图捏造别人间接侵略来掩盖自己的直接侵略。
    美英帝国主义出兵黎巴嫩和约旦的动机在政治上是由于伊拉克的革命成功，“形势根本改变”，动摇了它们在中东的殖民统治。这点它们自己已经不打自招了。它们提出的那些所谓理由都只是些借口。艾森豪威尔的中东政策失败了，美英帝国主义势力在中东面临完全垮台的危机，出兵是它们狗急跳墙的做法。美帝国主义一向伪善地披着同情反殖民主义的外衣，渗入世界各处殖民地或半殖民地，取英法帝国主义的势力而代之。这次为了急于挽救它那已经破产的艾森豪威尔主义，不惜把反殖民主义的外衣也脱下，而发动最凶恶的武装干涉。而英帝国主义也配合着美国出兵一道行动。美英侵略者这种行动，不仅破坏了直接受侵略的黎巴嫩和约旦的独立，威胁伊拉克共和国的安全，并且形成对阿拉伯各国人民的狂妄挑衅，严重威胁着中东和世界和平。美英帝国主义这种行动，无可否认地是对于国际法的粗暴破坏，正遭到全世界广大人民的一致谴责。它们对于自己的侵略罪行是负有不可逃避的责任的。
