	Notes
	An Idiot's Dream

	At a time when the economic crisis in the United States has become a huge disaster impacting the capitalist world, U.S. government officials have repeatedly spread blatant lies, attempting to soothe and deceive the uneasy hearts of the "free world." The most recent instance is the boast made by U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Frederick Mueller on July 1st. He said that the United States "will have the greatest period of economic activity the world has ever seen... what is about to come is a period of extremely great demand for our goods, services, and supplies, making the peaks of enterprise and industrial expansion we saw in 1955, 1956, and 1957 pale in comparison." It seems that what Mueller depicts is like a moving picture!

	However, coincidentally, a research report recently jointly submitted by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, which is under the leadership of this Assistant Secretary, points out: It will probably take until the end of 1960 (which is not the recent time!) for the U.S. economy to recover to (not to mention exceed!) the 1957 level. And at the beginning of 1959, which is "about to come," the number of unemployed will increase to seven million. The report also pointed out that today in the United States, there are already 18,261,000 men, women, and children receiving relief or subsidies, living a life of semi-starvation. There are also hundreds of thousands of people suffering from extreme poverty, but they do not ask for public assistance because they want to save face.

	The Assistant Secretary of Commerce seems to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to this report provided by his department, which can more accurately reflect reality. He just closes his eyes and deceives himself in vain. Such an idiot's dream only leaves a laughing stock in front of the whole world!

	Counterproductive

	U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, who has always firmly advocated implementing an "embargo" against socialist countries, said at a press conference on July 1st that because of "the industrial development within the Soviet bloc, some items that were originally on the embargo list are no longer suitable to be kept on it," therefore "some restrictions will be lifted."

	The purpose of the U.S. government in implementing the "embargo" policy was to try to undermine the economy of socialist countries, thereby strangling the socialist system. However, the result was counterproductive, and the economic system of the socialist camp countries is developing forward like riding the wind and waves. Even a person like Dulles cannot but admit this. And those countries that implement the "embargo" policy, especially the United States, are experiencing a serious economic crisis. This situation is a great irony to that stupid "embargo" policy. As for Dulles having to express that he wants to relax the "embargo," it is just a sad confession of the complete bankruptcy of this policy.

    札记
    痴人说梦
    在美国经济危机已成为冲击资本主义世界的巨大的灾难的今天，美国政府官员一次又一次地撒下漫天大谎，企图安慰和欺骗惶惶不安的“自由世界”的人心。最近的一次是美国助理商务部长弗雷德里克·米勒在7月1日吹的牛皮。他说，美国“将有一个全世界从未见过的最大的经济活动时期……即将到来的是一个对我们的货物、劳务和供应的需求极其巨大的时期，使我们在1955年、1956年和1957年所看到过的那些企业和工业扩充的顶峰相形见拙。”看来，米勒所描绘的很像是一幅动人的图画！
    但是，巧得很，就是在这位助理部长先生领导下的美国商务部和国会经济联席委员会最近共同提出的一项研究报告中指明：美国经济要恢复到（还不说超过！）1957年的水平，大概要到1960年年底（这可不是最近的时间！）。而在“即将到来”的1959年年初，失业人数还要增加到七百万人。这个报告还指出，今天美国已有一千八百二十六万一千男女和儿童在领取救济金或津贴，过着半饥半饱的生活。还有成千上万的人遭到了极端贫困的痛苦，但由于顾全面子而没有要求公共救济。
    对于他的部门所提供的这一个比较能反映现实的报告，助理商务部长似乎视而不见，充耳不闻。他只是闭上眼睛，枉费心机地自欺欺人。这种痴人说梦，徒然在全世界面前贻留笑柄！
    适得其反
    一向坚决主张对社会主义阵营国家实行“禁运”的美国国务卿杜勒斯，在7月1日的记者招待会上说，由于“苏联集团内的工业发展，有些原来在禁运货单上的项目现在已经不再适宜于保留在上面了”，因而“有些限制是会取消的”。
    美国政府实行“禁运”政策的目的，是想借此来破坏社会主义国家的经济，从而扼杀社会主义制度，然而结果适得其反，社会主义阵营国家的经济体系却如乘风破浪样地在向前发展。这一点连杜勒斯这号人也不能不承认了。而那些实施“禁运”政策的国家，首先是美国，却正在经历着严重的经济危机。这种情况，对那个愚蠢的“禁运”政策是一个绝好的讽刺。至于，杜勒斯不得不表示要放宽“禁运”，则不过是这种政策彻底破产的可悲的供状罢了。
