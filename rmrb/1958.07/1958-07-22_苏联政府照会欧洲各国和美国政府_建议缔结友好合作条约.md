Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 20th: The Soviet government, in a note of identical content to European governments and the U.S. government on the 15th, suggested that European countries and the United States conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation, and simultaneously presented a draft of the treaty.

The note points out that the Soviet government believes that if the governments of European countries and the United States all want to prevent the dangerous development of the European situation, they should make efforts to formulate regional, pan-European solutions that should be practical at this stage and acceptable to all governments.

The Soviet government believes that this treaty should include provisions aimed at preventing and resisting acts of aggression occurring in Europe and consolidating the security of all European countries. It is important that European countries and the United States should undertake obligations not to provide military and economic assistance or moral support to any country that undermines peace in Europe, regardless of whether they are allies in existing military conventions and treaties with the country launching the aggression.

In its proposal, the Soviet government advocates taking measures to promote a halt to the arms race and to induce the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to adopt disarmament measures. The note states that European countries taking the initiative in seeking such partial solutions could also open up prospects for reaching broader agreements related to disarmament issues.

The draft treaty stipulates the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe. This zone should be located directly adjacent to the line of demarcation between the two military blocs in Europe. The contracting parties should undertake the responsibility to respect the status of the aforementioned zone and consider the territories of the countries included in this zone to be a nuclear-weapon-free area.

The Soviet government proposes stipulating that the number of foreign troops stationed in Germany be reduced by one-third, or another mutually agreed upon number, within the next one to two years, and that an agreement be reached on establishing a system of supervision and inspection for the implementation of this obligation. The Soviet government agrees to aerial photography in the area 800 kilometers above the demarcation line between the garrison areas of the Warsaw Treaty participants and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization participants to prevent surprise attacks.

The draft treaty stipulates the expansion of equal and mutually beneficial economic cooperation without any discrimination or artificial restrictions.

The Soviet government believes that the treaty should reflect the contracting parties' desire to exchange experience in scientific research, experience in the use of atomic energy for industry, and to provide each other with raw materials, materials, and equipment. The contracting parties can develop mutual contacts on a more solid basis, especially in the fields of science, technology, and culture.

The Soviet government's motivation for making the proposal is to hope that through joint efforts, common measures can be formulated to prevent Europe from being pushed into war and to find ways to consolidate peace.

The note points out that the conclusion of the non-aggression pact proposed by the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Organization between the Warsaw Treaty member states and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states will undoubtedly play a huge and positive role. The note emphasizes that without the joint efforts of European countries and the establishment of comprehensive cooperation between them, European peace and security cannot be guaranteed.

    苏联政府照会欧洲各国和美国政府
    建议缔结友好合作条约
    新华社21日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：苏联政府在15日给欧洲各国政府和美国政府同样内容的照会，建议欧洲各国以及美国缔结友好合作条约，并且同时提出了条约的草案。
    照会指出，苏联政府认为，欧洲各国政府以及美国政府如果都想要制止欧洲局势的危险发展，就应该作出努力，以便制定地方性的全欧解决办法，这些办法应当在现阶段就是切实可行的，并且是所有政府都可以接受的。
    苏联政府认为，这个条约应该包括有旨在防止和抵抗在欧洲发生的侵略行动以及巩固一切欧洲国家的安全的条款。重要的是：欧洲国家和美国应该承担义务，不管它们是不是发动侵略的国家在现有军事公约和条约中的盟国，它们都不给任何破坏欧洲和平的国家提供军事和经济援助或道义上的支持。
    苏联政府在建议中主张采取措施来促进停止军备竞赛和促使华沙条约组织和北大西洋公约组织采取裁军措施。照会说，欧洲国家在寻求这种局部解决问题的途径方面采取主动也可以为达成与裁军问题有关的更广泛的协议打开一个前景。
    条约草案中规定在欧洲建立无原子武器地区。这一地区应当直接靠近欧洲两个军事集团的分界线。缔约国应当承担起尊重上述地区地位的责任，并认为这一地区所包括的国家的领土是不使用核武器的范围。
    苏联政府建议规定在最近一、二年内把驻在德国的外国军队人数缩减三分之一或者是另外的大家同意的数目，并且就对执行这一义务建立监督和视察系统的问题达成协议。苏联政府同意在距离华沙条约参加国和北大西洋公约组织参加国驻军区的分界线两边各八百公里上空的区域内进行空中摄影，以预防突然袭击。
    条约草案规定在没有任何歧视和没有任何形式的人为限制的基础上扩大平等互利的经济合作。
    苏联政府认为应当在条约中反映缔约国关于交换科学研究工作经验、把原子能用于工业的经验以及互相提供原料、材料和设备的愿望。缔约国可以在更巩固的基础上发展相互的接触，特别是在科学、技术和文化方面。
    苏联政府提出建议的动机，是希望经过一番努力而制定共同措施，使欧洲不致被推入战争，找出巩固和平的途径。
    照会指出，缔结华沙条约政治协商委员会提出的关于华沙条约缔约国和北大西洋公约组织成员国之间的互不侵犯公约，毫无疑问将会起巨大的积极作用。照会强调说，没有欧洲各国的共同努力和建立它们之间的全面合作，欧洲的和平与安全是不可能得到保障的。
