Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: Statement by the Spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs commenting on Dulles' remarks concerning the Sino-US Ambassadorial Talks (July 2, 1958)

    The issue of appointing ambassadorial representatives within a specified time to resume talks, as proposed by the Chinese government in its June 30 statement regarding the Sino-US ambassadorial talks, is unavoidable. However, Dulles equivocated, was ambiguous, and did his utmost to confuse the public.
    Dulles said that if China agreed to change the location of the talks, the United States would appoint its ambassador to Poland to participate; however, he also said that the United States would not bow to China's "ultimatum" of appointing ambassadorial representatives to resume talks within a specified time.
    Changing the location of the talks is a new issue that the United States has never raised before. Now, raising this issue as if it were a real problem cannot shirk the United States' responsibility for the long-term interruption of the Sino-US talks, nor can it relieve the United States' embarrassing position on the issue of appointing ambassadorial representatives. Dulles agreed in his previous sentence to appoint ambassadorial representatives and even suggested a possible specific candidate, but then said that he could not agree to the Chinese government's request that the United States appoint ambassadorial representatives. This puts Dulles in a ridiculous situation of self-contradiction.
    Dulles described the Chinese government's reasonable request that the US government appoint ambassadorial representatives within fifteen days as an "ultimatum," and therefore unacceptable, because accepting it would be bowing down. This statement is specious and cannot withstand scrutiny. Holding ambassadorial talks is the result of consultations between China and the United States. The United States has an obligation to abide by international agreements. However, the United States, disregarding our objections, has refused to implement this agreement for more than half a year. Since the United States can violate the agreement for more than six months, why can't China demand the resumption of the implementation of this agreement within fifteen days? China's request is entirely reasonable.

### 我外交部发言人评杜勒斯谈话  指出他对恢复中美会谈问题闪烁其辞自相矛盾

    我外交部发言人评杜勒斯谈话
    指出他对恢复中美会谈问题闪烁其辞自相矛盾
    新华社2日讯　外交部发言人评杜勒斯关于中美大使级会谈的谈话（1958年7月2日）
     7月1日美国国务卿杜勒斯就6月30日中国政府关于中美大使级会谈的声明发表了谈话。中国政府在声明中提出来的限期指派大使级代表恢复会谈问题是不能逃避的。但是，杜勒斯却闪烁其辞，模棱两可，竭尽混淆视听的能事。
    杜勒斯说，如果中国同意改变会谈地点，美国将指派它的驻波大使参加会谈；但是他又说，美国不会向中国限期指派大使级代表恢复会谈的“最后通牒”低头。
    改变会谈地点是美国从来没有提出过的新问题，现在，若有其事地提出这个问题既不能推卸美国长期中断中美会谈的责任，也不能解除美国在指派大使级代表问题上的狼狈处境。杜勒斯在前一句话里同意指派大使级代表，而且提出了可能的具体人选，但跟着又说他不能同意中国政府要美国指派大使级代表的要求。这就使杜勒斯处于自相矛盾的可笑境地。
    杜勒斯把中国政府提出的要美国政府在十五天内指派大使级代表的合理要求说成是“最后通牒”，因而是不能接受的，因为一接受，就是低头了。这番话似是而非，经不起一驳。举行大使级会谈是中美双方协商的结果。美国有义务遵守国际协议。但是，美国方面不顾我方的反对，拒不执行这个协议达半年多之久，美国既然可以违反协议六个多月，中国为什么不能提出在十五天内恢复执行这个协议的要求？中国的要求是完全合理的。
