Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 28th: The minority peoples of the Yunnan border strongly protest the armed aggression of US and British imperialism in the Middle East.

	More than one million minority people in eight autonomous prefectures, including Dehong and Xishuangbanna, held many rallies and demonstrations to protest the piratical actions of US and British imperialism. In Menghai and five other counties in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, more than 30,000 Dai, Hani, and other ethnic people held rallies. Zhao Cunxin, the head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, who is currently receiving treatment in Kunming, also told reporters from his sickbed that the people of Xishuangbanna fully support our government's statement on the US aggression against Lebanon and our government's protest to Britain, and demand that the US and British aggressors immediately get out of the Middle East, and that the US aggressors immediately get out of Taiwan.

	More than 100,000 people of all ethnic groups in the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture held rallies and demonstrations in the Ailao Mountains. A representative of the Hani farmers from the Nonglukang Township Agricultural Cooperative in Jinping County said at the meeting: We minority peoples have suffered enough from imperialist oppression in the past, and we can imagine the suffering of the Arab people now. We will never allow the knife that was stuck in our throats in the past to be stuck in the necks of the Middle Eastern people again. Li Hecai, the head of the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, who is currently attending a meeting in Kunming, also warned US and British imperialism to get out of the Middle East immediately on behalf of the 1.7 million people of all ethnic groups in the entire autonomous prefecture.

	The Kawa people, who live adjacent to the national border, also expressed strong protest against US and British imperialism. On the 22nd, more than 1,000 people in Cangyuan County in the Kawa Mountains held a protest rally. Speakers pointed out that British imperialism had previously invaded the Kawa Mountains with armed forces, but was met with a head-on blow from the Kawa people. Now that US and British imperialism are playing with fire in the Middle East, they will certainly be beaten black and blue by the Arab people.

    云南边疆各族人民同声抗议
    警告帝国主义赶快滚出中东
    新华社昆明28日电　云南省边疆各少数民族人民强硬抗议美英帝国主义对中东的武装侵略。
    德宏、西双版纳等八个自治州的一百多万少数民族人民举行了许多集会和示威游行抗议美英帝国主义的海盗行为。在西双版纳傣族自治州勐海等五个县，有三万多傣、哈尼等族人民举行了集会。正在昆明治病的西双版纳傣族自治州州长召存信也在病床上向记者表示西双版纳人民完全拥护我国政府关于美军侵略黎巴嫩的声明和我国政府向英国提出的抗议，并且要求美英侵略军立即从中东滚出去，美国侵略军立即从台湾滚出去。
    红河哈尼族彝族自治州的十多万各族人民，在哀牢山上举行了集会和示威游行。金平县摉鹿塘乡农业社哈尼族农民代表在会上说：我们少数民族过去受够了帝国主义的压迫，对于阿拉伯人民现在的苦难，是能够想见的。我们决不允许过去插在我们喉咙上的刀子，再插在中东人民的脖子上。正在昆明开会的红河哈尼族彝族自治州州长李和才也代表全自治州一百七十多万各族人民警告美英帝国主义赶快滚出中东。
    紧邻国境线的佧佤族人也向美英帝国主义表示强烈抗议。22日，佧佤山中的沧源县有一千多人举行了抗议集会。人们在发言中指出，英帝国主义者过去曾武装侵略过佧佤山，结果受到佧佤族人的迎头痛击。现在美英帝国主义又到中东玩火，它们一定也会被阿拉伯人民打得头破血流。
