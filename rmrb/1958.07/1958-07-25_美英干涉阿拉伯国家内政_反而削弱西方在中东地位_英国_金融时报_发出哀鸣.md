Xinhua News Agency, London, July 23rd: The "Financial Times," representing the views of British monopoly groups, admits that US-British armed intervention in the Middle East has weakened their position in the region. The newspaper believes that the presence of British and American armed forces in Lebanon and Jordan "neither increases the prestige of Britain and America nor strengthens the regimes they are maintaining."

The newspaper acknowledges that Western countries have made a mistake in attempting to maintain feudal dynasties and oppose national liberation movements. The attempt to extend the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, aimed at opposing the Soviet Union, to the Middle East has failed.

The newspaper warns that "any attempt to interfere (in the internal affairs of Arab countries) will ultimately further weaken the position of the West." The newspaper calls for "formulating a policy that makes it possible to withdraw British and American troops from Lebanon and Jordan."

    美英干涉阿拉伯国家内政
    反而削弱西方在中东地位
    英国“金融时报”发出哀鸣
    据新华社伦敦23日电　代表英国垄断集团意见的“金融时报”承认，美英对中东的武装干涉削弱了它们在中东的地位。这家报纸认为，英美武装部队留在黎巴嫩和约旦，“既不能增加英美的威望，也不能加强他们所维持的制度”。
    报纸承认，西方国家企图维持封建王朝，反对民族解放运动，这就犯了错误。打算把以反对苏联为目的的北大西洋集团的主张扩展到中东的企图已经失败了。
    这家报纸警告说，“任何干涉（阿拉伯国家内政）的企图归根结蒂将更加削弱西方的地位”，报纸要求“拟订一种政策，使得有可能把英美军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦”。
