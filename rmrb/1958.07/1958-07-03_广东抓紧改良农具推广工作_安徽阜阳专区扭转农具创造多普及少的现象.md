Guangdong Seizes the Opportunity to Improve Farm Tool Promotion
Anhui Fuyang Prefecture Reverses the Phenomenon of Many Farm Tool Creations but Few Popularizations

    (Our report) Guangdong Province's farmers are vigorously reforming farm tools during the busy summer harvest and planting season to solve the contradictions of tight seasons, heavy tasks, and a shortage of labor.
    According to incomplete statistics as of June 24, after fully realizing vehicle-ization, Hainan Administrative Region and Hepu Prefecture have manufactured and promoted nearly 200,000 new farm tools, including double-share plows, May First plows, rice transplanting boats, harvesting machines, and harrowing machines. In Gaoyao, Foshan, Shaoguan, Huiyang, Zhanjiang, and Shantou Prefectures, approximately 1,460,000 new farm tools, such as harvesting machines, dryers, rice transplanting boats, row markers, new-style plows and harrows, and transport vehicles and boats, have been promoted and manufactured in some counties. The promotion and use of these new farm tools can generally increase labor efficiency by one to two times. For example, in previous years, Qiongdong County had to mobilize more than 30,000 people every day during the summer harvest season. This year, with the widespread adoption of new summer harvesting tools, only 18,000 people are needed each day, and the working time has been shortened by more than ten days compared to previous years.
    The summer harvest and planting season has always been the most tense and heavy season for agricultural work throughout the year. Party committees at all levels in the province have grasped farm tool reform as a key link to resolve this contradiction. From mid-April to late June of this year, more than 500,000 people from more than 100 counties, more than 2,000 townships, and more than 30,000 cooperatives across the province visited and learned from the Provincial Farm Tool Reform Promotion and Evaluation Exhibition being held in Guangzhou. Subsequently, various localities established farm tool reform committees or working groups and other institutions to lead the mass farm tool reform movement. The vast majority of counties and townships held and convened local farm tool reform exhibitions, blacksmith and carpenter symposiums, and activist mobilization meetings to conduct extensive publicity among the masses. Many counties, townships, and cooperatives organized technical training classes to impart advanced experience and related technologies. Xinhui, Yunan, and Xinfeng counties established hundreds of medium-sized and small farm tool factories in a very short period of time, forming a farm tool repair and assembly network with the county farm tool machinery factory as the core and the township and cooperative small farm tool repair and assembly plants as the periphery, and extensively carrying out division of labor and cooperation.

    (Our report) The Fuyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, holding high the red flag of the technological revolution, led the people of the entire prefecture to rapidly promote a large number of improved farm tools.
    According to statistics from June 16 to 24, more than 670,000 improved farm tools have been promoted throughout the area. Among them, more than 180,000 are water lifting tools, more than 160,000 are paddy field machines for converting to rice planting, and more than 50,000 are deep plows. There are also other improved farm tools. In many counties, districts, and townships, old-fashioned farm tools have been basically eliminated in operations such as threshing, paddy fielding, or water lifting. Due to the promotion of improved farm tools, the progress of summer production has been greatly accelerated. Even in the case of prolonged drought, the entire prefecture quickly completed more than 70% of the summer planting tasks.
    The Fuyang Prefecture has created and improved many types of tools in the past six months, but some places have promoted them very little. In mid-June, Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, instructed the Fuyang Prefectural Committee that powerful measures should be taken immediately to rapidly promote improved farm tools. The Fuyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a telephone conference overnight, requiring all localities to promote the improved farm tools that had already been improved within a limited time. Due to the importance attached by the leadership, a vigorous movement to promote improved tools was quickly launched throughout the prefecture.
    In order to further promote farm tool reform, the Fuyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting of county party secretaries, requesting that all water lifting tools, processing mills, and transportation tools be completely reformed by July 10. By the end of August, all kinds of old-fashioned farm tools in the area will be new-style, especially the deep plows and close-planting drills needed for autumn planting. At the same time, it is also required to immediately start creating more soil-digging, soil-loading, and soil-transporting tools for this winter's water conservancy movement.

### 广东抓紧改良农具推广工作  安徽阜阳专区扭转农具创造多普及少的现象

    广东抓紧改良农具推广工作
    安徽阜阳专区扭转农具创造多普及少的现象
    本报讯　广东省各地农民在夏收夏种大忙季节中，大搞农具改革，以解决季节紧迫、任务繁重、劳动力少的矛盾。
    据截至6月24日的不完全统计，海南行政区和合浦专区继全面实现车子化之后，又制造和推广了双铧犁、五一犁、插秧船、打禾机、耙田机等几种新式农具近二十多万部。高要、佛山、韶关、惠阳、湛江和汕头等专区部分县推广和制造的打禾机、干燥器、插秧船、划行器、新式犁耙、运输车船等新式农具约一百四十六万多件。这些新式农具的推广使用，一般都可以把劳动效率提高一、二倍。例如琼东县往年在夏收期间每天要出动三万多人，今年广泛采用新式的夏收工具，每天只需一万八千多人，而且工作时间却比往年缩短了十多天。
    夏收夏种历来就是全省全年农活最紧张、繁重的季节。全省各级党委抓住农具改革这一环来解决这个矛盾。从今年4月中旬到6月下旬的两个多月中，全省一百多个县、二千多个乡、三万多个社一共组织了五十多万人，前往正在广州举行的全省农具改革推广评比展览会参观学习。接着各地成立了农具改革委员会或工作组等机构，领导开展群众性的农具改革运动。全省绝大部分县、乡都举办和召开了本地区的农具改革展览会、铁匠木匠座谈会和积极分子动员会，向群众进行广泛的宣传。不少县乡社组织了技术训练班，传授先进经验和有关的技术。新会、郁南、新丰等县在很短的时间内便建立了数以百计的中、小型农具厂，组成了一个以县农具机械厂为核心，乡、社的小型农具修配厂为外围的农具修配网，广泛地进行分工协作。
    本报讯　中共安徽省阜阳地委高举技术革命红旗，领导全专区人民迅速地推广了大量改良农具。
    据6月16日到24日的统计，全区已推广了六十七万多件改良农具。其中提水工具十八万多件，改种水稻的和田机十六万多件，深耕犁五万多件。另外还有其他的改良农具。很多县、区、乡在打场、和田或提水等操作中，已基本消灭了旧式农具。由于推广了改良农具，大大加速了夏季生产的进展，在久旱不雨的情况下，全专区仍很快地完成了夏种任务的70％以上。
    阜阳专区半年来创造和改良的工具种类很多，但有些地方推广得很少。6月中旬，中共中央书记处书记谭震林同志在阜阳指示地委，应立刻采取有力措施，把改良农具迅速推广。中共阜阳地委连夜召开电话会议，要求各地限期推广已经改良的农具，由于领导上重视，全专区很快就掀起了一个声势浩大的推广改良工具的运动。
    为了进一步推广农具改革，中共阜阳地委最近又召开了县委书记会议，要求在7月10日前，把提水工具、加工磨、运输工具全部改革完毕。到8月底，全区实现各种旧式农具新式化，特别是秋种中需要的深耕犁、密植耧要全部改良。同时并要求立即为今冬的水利运动着手创造更多的挖土、装土、运土工具。
