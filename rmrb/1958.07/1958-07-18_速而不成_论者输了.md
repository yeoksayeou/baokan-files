The "Speed Without Success" Theorists Have Lost
Xiao Min
Can illiteracy eradication be fast? If it's fast, can it be consolidated? The facts have already answered. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, a wave of cultural revolution has been launched, and illiteracy eradication work has also made a leap forward. Up until recently, in a short four to five months, more than 20 million young and middle-aged illiterates have been eliminated nationwide. This figure accounts for about two-thirds of the number of illiterates eliminated in the eight years since liberation; 444 counties and cities nationwide are basically free of illiteracy, accounting for one-fifth of the total number of counties and cities in the country. In many places, it no longer takes years or hundreds of days to eliminate an illiterate, but only a few months or dozens of days. Many counties have basically achieved illiteracy eradication, not in the originally planned twelve years, seven years, or five years, but in two years, one year, or a few months. Moreover, the phenomenon of relapse after illiteracy eradication is also rare. Facts prove that illiteracy eradication can not only be fast, but also good and economical, not only consolidated, but also improved. In the face of the facts, the "speed without success" theorists, like the "wait-and-see faction" and the "score-settling faction," have lost.

The "speed without success" theorists believe that illiteracy eradication cannot be fast, good, and economical mainly because they wear conservative glasses and cannot see the masses' thirst for learning culture, nor can they see the masses' will and strength to seize the cultural fortress. With the development of the great leap forward in production and the needs of the technological revolution, the masses' demand for culture is even stronger. Not only is the number of people participating in literacy unprecedented in history, but they have also created a variety of learning forms and teaching methods. After getting rid of illiteracy, they also demand improvement. Some local people say that after hard study, they finally removed the illiteracy label, and they must never roll down the mountainside again, but must climb to the top of the mountain. The slogan "Read a hundred books, write ten thousand characters" in Heilongjiang Province was put forward by the Fengtian Agricultural Cooperative in Jiejixiang, Tailai County. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "The people demand popularization, and then they also demand improvement, demanding improvement year by year and month by month. Here, popularization is the popularization of the people, and improvement is also the improvement of the people." As long as the leading cadres in charge of illiteracy eradication are good at following the mass line, good at concentrating the demands and opinions of the masses, and then returning to the masses to inspire their awareness and turn it into the actions of the masses, the speed of illiteracy eradication will certainly be fast, and consolidation and improvement will be possible.

Now it seems that there are basically two aspects to consolidation and improvement measures. One is to organize the masses to read and write more, like the masses in Heilongjiang Province reading a large number of political theory, literary books, newspapers, and periodicals, etc., like Ning'an County, where men, women, and children all start from actual life and combine with productive labor to write poems and articles. The other is to quickly establish spare-time middle schools, primary schools, agricultural middle schools, etc., so that young and middle-aged people who have gotten rid of illiteracy can continue to study. As long as we do this, we are not afraid of not being able to consolidate and improve.

    “速而不成”论者输了
    萧敏
    扫除文盲究竟能不能快？快了能不能巩固？事实已经作了答复。在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，掀起了文化革命的浪潮，扫除文盲工作也有了飞跃发展。到最近为止，在短短的四五个月当中，全国已经扫除了青壮年文盲二千多万，这个数字约占解放八年以来已扫除文盲数的三分之二；全国已有四百四十四个县市基本上无文盲，占全国县市总数的五分之一。许多地方扫除一个文盲再不要几年或几百天，而只要几个月或几十天；许多县基本上做到无文盲，不是像原订计划十二年、七年或五年，而是二年、一年或几个月，而且扫除文盲以后的回生现象也很少。事实证明，扫除文盲不仅能够多快，而且能够好省，不仅能够巩固，而且也能够提高。在事实面前，“速而不成”论者同“观潮派”和“秋后算账派”一样，他们是输了。
    “速而不成”论者认为扫盲不能多快好省的原因，主要是他们戴着一副保守眼镜，看不到群众如饥如渴的学习文化的要求，看不到群众夺取文化堡垒的意志和力量。随着生产大跃进形势的发展和技术革命的需要，广大群众对于文化的要求更为强烈，不仅参加识字人数为历史上前所未有，而且也创造了多种多样的学习形式和教学方法。他们在摆脱了文盲状态以后，又要求提高。有的地方群众说，经过苦学，才摘掉文盲帽子，绝不能爬到半山坡再滚下去，必须爬到山顶。黑龙江省的“读百本书，写万个字”的口号，就是泰来县街基乡丰田农业社提出的。正如毛主席指出的：“人民要求普及，跟着也就要求提高，要求逐年逐月地提高。在这里，普及是人民的普及，提高也是人民的提高。”只要主管扫盲工作的领导干部善于走群众路线，善于把群众的要求、意见集中起来，然后再回到群众中去，启发群众的自觉，变成群众的行动，扫除文盲的速度一定能够快，巩固和提高也就有办法。
    现在看来，巩固和提高的措施基本上有两个方面，一个是组织群众多读、多写，就像黑龙江省的群众那样大量地阅读政治理论、文艺书籍、报刊等，像宁安县一样男女老少都从实际生活出发，结合生产劳动，来作诗、写文章；另一个是迅速地建立业余中学、小学、农业中学等，使已经摆脱文盲的青壮年能够继续读书。只要这样做，就不怕不能巩固，不能提高。
