    Seeking Perfection and Achieving Perfection
    Chen Zequn
    When dealing with innovative proposals from ordinary workers, there are commonly two attitudes: one is the "perfectionist" who demands perfection, and the other is the "achiever" who tries their best to make it happen.
    Some Westernized engineering and technical personnel who rely solely on books are filled with disapproval and disdain when faced with the "rustic" methods proposed by their "native" compatriots. But what can they do? They dare not use the "mourning stick" of fake foreign devils to strike out repeatedly, nor can they use the vermillion brush of an ancient judge to make a sweeping judgment. So they begin to nitpick, using a microscope with infinite magnification. Any invention or creation, whether completed or not, as long as they deem it to have an "improper origin," they can always find flaws that are supposedly "making fun of science."
    First, they ask you for "calculated data," and then ask if you have an attached drawing. If not, it is said to be "very inconvenient" to review. These two points alone are enough to "checkmate" those who are just struggling to solve four arithmetic operations in cultural night schools. Moreover, honest workers often lack their ability to be "eloquent." After being questioned from all sides, those with less courage give up, and even the most promising plans are submerged in their bursts of laughter.
    Another trick of the perfectionists is to consult the classics. Specifically, they want to look up their lecture notes from their university days. Some don't even need to look anything up, because they "remember" and "heard" a lot of things. For example, you wait with enthusiasm for them to express their opinions, but they slowly frown and say, "I remember" that an American professor studied it for a lifetime without success, and "I heard" that a foreign manufacturer also tried and failed, leading to closure. With your suggestions that have neither calculated data nor attached drawings, you still want to achieve something? It's better to be "cautious" and go back and think about it again (perhaps for at least ten or eight years), think "comprehensively," and "then we'll study it again!"
    However, many "rustic" methods show their achievements in just ten days or half a month, without needing ten or eight years. The "perfectionists," in a panic, quickly bring out their microscopes again and place these undeniable achievements under lenses with infinite magnification. While looking, they mutter that the steel smelted in a rustic furnace has "too many mixed components," and the cars trial-produced with rustic methods "might break down halfway one day." Also, there are more than 800,000 kinds of insects, and Li Shimei can only cure termites, "not comprehensive!"
    Precisely because any innovative proposal cannot be perfect at the beginning, the nitpicking "perfectionists" can always find something to say. If these proposals encounter difficulties or even temporary failures in practice, the perfectionists can more confidently say that they predicted it in advance. This is indeed one of the obstacles to our mass technological innovation movement, causing some potentially successful proposals to miscarry or die young, and causing some "rustic" people to lose their sharpness.
    What is admirable is the other kind of "achiever." Even if they are still called "laymen" in technology, many inventions and creations are being achieved and realized under their encouragement and assistance. They wholeheartedly welcome innovative proposals from the masses. They listen patiently instead of nitpicking and questioning. They would rather ponder on the spot than worry about data and attached drawings, encouraging people to dare to step out where predecessors have not left footprints, and dare to continue exploring problems that foreigners have admitted defeat on. They provide the proposers with practical conditions, recommend assistants and collaborators for them, and give comfort, support, and strength when the experimenters suffer setbacks, failures, and major difficulties. It is they who have made some incomplete proposals comprehensive, made some things that could have been realized ahead of schedule, and saved some temporary failures. Rustic experts like these "achievers" and regard them as "soulmates."
    Let the facts slap the "perfectionists" in the face a few more times.
    Let us have as many "achievers" as possible.

    求全和成全
    陈泽群
    在处理来自普通工人的革新创议时，常见的有两种态度，一种是求全责备的“求全派”，一种是极力促成的“成全派”。
    某些洋气十足的只靠书本吃饭的工程技术人员，面对着自己的“土”同胞所提的“土”法子，满心眼地不服和不屑一顾，但怎么办呢？既不敢用假洋鬼子的“哭丧棒”来拍拍拍地打一阵，也不能用古时判官的朱砂笔勾判一通，于是挑剔起来了，用的是一架无限倍数的显微镜。任何已成或未成的发明创造，只要是他认为“来路不正”的，就总能找到这样那样的据说是“跟科学开玩笑”的毛病来。
    首先他向你要“计算数据”，然后问你有没有一份附图？如果没有，据说审理起来是“很不方便”的。而仅此两端，对于刚刚上文化夜校吃力地演算四则题的人来说，是很容易被“将军”的。偏偏老老实实的工人们又缺乏他们那种“口若悬河”的本事，被左盘右诘一通之后，勇气差一些的人，也就不再坚持下去了，那怕再有希望的方案，也会没顶于他们一阵哈哈的笑声中。
    求全派的另一招儿就是要查证一番典籍，具体地说来，就是要翻查一下他早年在大学听课时的讲义和笔记，有的甚至什么都不必查，因为他很多东西都“记得”和“听说”过，例如你满腔热情等待他发表点意见，他却慢吞吞地把眉皱了：“记得”美国一位什么教授研究了一辈子也没有成功，“听说”外国一个什么厂家也尝试失败而致关门——凭你们这些既无计算数据又无附图的建议，也想搞出啥名堂？还是“慎重”点，再回去想想（也许至少得十年八年吧），想“全面”了，“到时我们再研究吧”！
    而好些“土”法子无须十年八年，仅十天半月就显示了它的成就，“求全派”惊惶之余，就急急地又把显微镜搬出来了，把这些无法抹煞的成就摆在无限倍数的镜头之下，一边看，一边念念有词，说是土炉子炼出的钢，“成分太杂乱”，土法子试制出来的汽车，“保不定那天会半路抛锚”；还有，昆虫有八十多万种，李始美只能治其中一种的白蚁，“不全面”！
    正因为任何一份革新创议在起初都不可能十全十美，因此，竟在挑剔的“求全派”也就总能找到点话说，如果这些创议在实践中碰到困难乃至于一时失败，求全派就更可以振振有词地说他预言在先了。这的确是我们群众性的技术革新运动的阻力之一，使一些本可成功的创议流产或者夭折，使一些“土里土气”的人丧失了锐气。
    令人感佩的，是另一种“成全派”，他们即或在技术上还被称为“外行”，但眼下许多发明创造就正是在他们的鼓励和协助下被成全了，实现了。他们满心欢迎来自群众的革新创议，他们耐心地倾听而不是吹毛求疵地盘诘，他们宁可在现场揣摸而不计较数据和附图，鼓励人们敢于在前人未曾留下足迹的地方跨步出去，敢于在洋人认过输的问题上，继续进行探索。他们给创议者提供实践的条件，替他们推荐助手和协作者，在尝试者遭受挫折、失败和重大困难的时候，给予安慰、支持和力量。正是他们，使一些并不全面的创议全面了，使一些本来可以实现的事提前实现了，使一些暂时的失败得以挽救，土专家喜欢这样的“成全派”，把他们看作“知音”。
    让事实多打几下“求全派”的耳光。
    让我们有尽可能多的“成全派”。
