American bandits have broken into Lebanon, trying to ignite the flames of a war of aggression here. The Lebanese people are rising up to resist, and the people of the world are rising up to support them. The sound of protest is shaking the heavens and the earth. The flames of the anti-aggression war will be even higher than the flames of the war of aggression. In a fight, the victor will surely be the peace-loving people, and the aggressor will inevitably avoid a shameful defeat.

A leading imperialist country barging into a "small country" does not illustrate the strength of the imperialist forces, but rather is sufficient to illustrate the fragility of the imperialist forces.

The Lebanese people's uprising has lasted for more than two months. This is a wave in the anti-imperialist tide of the entire Middle East. It is impacting the cornerstone of imperialist rule in the Middle East, namely the "pro-Western government" as the Americans call it. It is inevitable that imperialism will hate this revolutionary wave and want to eliminate it.

For the imperialists, there seem to be three strategies, superior, middling, and inferior, for dealing with the Lebanese insurgents. Through their secret support, their running dogs can quell this wave, so that the imperialists can still quietly rule some countries in the Middle East. This is the superior strategy. The imperialists once dreamed of being able to do this a little over a month ago.

However, at the beginning of June, the wave of the Lebanese people's revolution rose higher. Seeing that the imperialists' running dogs were in danger of being submerged, the United States, Britain, and France all clamored for intervention, but did not dare to act rashly. Under their conspiracies, they cobbled together a so-called United Nations observation group to go there. After this so-called observation group carried out some activities, plus secretly sending people to intervene, they hoped that this could first withstand this wave, and then gradually quell it. If this could be done, it would naturally still be a middling strategy.

But soon, the Iraqi people's revolution appeared and achieved victory swiftly. This is an even greater wave of revolution in the Middle East, and it will inevitably promote a higher surge in the entire Middle East revolutionary tide. This was completely beyond the expectations of the imperialists, and all the imperialists were therefore flustered. The cornerstone of the Baghdad Pact, which served as a tool for American imperialism's aggression in the Middle East, has therefore completely collapsed, and the disintegration and collapse of the entire Baghdad Pact is a foregone conclusion; the Eisenhower Doctrine, which had taken a lot of effort to cultivate in a small area of ​​the Middle East, is about to be completely buried. Thus, the Americans were forced to appear on the scene bloodily before they even had time to disguise themselves. Even without "evidence," they will act; without evidence of "direct aggression," they say there is a "threat of indirect aggression"; without other reasons, they say they are going to protect their expatriates. In short, they talk nonsense and hurriedly send troops into Lebanon. It is not difficult for people to see that this is the "inferior strategy" forced out by the revolutionary situation of the Middle Eastern people. The Middle Eastern people, who have been enslaved for a long time, can use their own strength to force the world's leading imperialist to expose its aggressive tail nakedly in front of the people of the world. This is enough to illustrate how powerful the people there have become. The oppressed people can also gain the confidence of certain victory from this.

The last trick of imperialism has been forced out, and there is nothing to be afraid of. Nor should we have any illusions about imperialism. Driven by its own demands, it will inevitably start a fire in Lebanon, and its main purpose is to ignite the flames of war from here towards Iraq in order to save the Baghdad Pact, which is about to collapse. Only if the powerful people of the world act immediately can they sever the arsonist's wrist; any show of weakness will only strengthen the ambition of the petty person.

American imperialism dares to brazenly break into Lebanon, naturally because in its view, Lebanon is just a "small country," while it itself is a "giant." This is the foolish imperialism deceiving itself. It does not see that although this country is small, its anti-aggression struggle is just, and therefore it will definitely receive the support of the people of the world, and its strength will be infinitely great. And imperialism is nothing but a drop in the ocean. When Britain, France, and Israel combined faced Egypt, were not the former "giants" and the latter "small"? What was the result? May I ask Mr. Ike and Mr. Dulles, what was the reason for Prime Minister Eden, who once had great ambitions, to retire?

The problem is not who is bigger and who is smaller in isolation, but that the world is now a situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. Let us mobilize urgently, people of the world who love peace, we must extinguish the flames of war ignited by the American robbers. We are just. In the war, it will be the unjust imperialists who are destroyed, not us.

    大小和强弱
    阮延顺
    美国强盗已经闯进了黎巴嫩，想在这里点燃起侵略战争的大火，黎巴嫩人民正奋起抵抗，世界人民正奋起声援，抗议之声震撼天地，反侵略战争之火，将比侵略战争的火焰还要高，在一场搏斗中，战胜者必定是爱好和平的人民，侵略者必然避免不了失败的可耻下场。
    一个头号帝国主义国家，闯进一个“小小的国家”，这件事并不说明帝国主义势力的强大，倒足以说明帝国主义势力之脆弱。
    黎巴嫩人民的起义已经持续有两个多月了。这是整个中东人民反帝国主义潮流中的一个浪头。它冲击的是帝国主义在中东统治的基石，即美国人所说的“亲西方的政府”。帝国主义仇视这种革命的浪头，想消灭它是必然的。
    对于帝国主义者来说，对待黎巴嫩的起义者，似乎有上、中、下三策。经过它们的暗中支持，它的走狗，就能平息这种浪头，使帝国主义者不动声色的仍可安然统治中东一些国家。这是上策。一个多月前，帝国主义者们曾经梦想能够这样。
    可是，6月初，黎巴嫩人民革命的浪头高了起来，眼看帝国主义的走狗有了没顶的危险，于是美英法都曾大嚷要进行干涉，但是又不敢贸然行动。在他们阴谋活动之下，拼凑了一个所谓联合国的观察组前去。经过这个所谓的观察组活动一番，加上暗中派人干涉，希望这样能够先顶住这种浪头，以后再逐渐平息它。倘能如此，自然还不失为中策。
    但是不久，就出现了伊拉克人民的革命，而且神速地取得了胜利。这是中东人民革命的一个更为巨大的浪头，而且必然会推动整个中东革命浪潮的更加高涨。这是完全出乎帝国主义意料之外的，所有的帝国主义都因此慌了手脚。作为美帝国主义侵略中东的工具的巴格达条约的基石，因此已完全塌陷了，整个巴格达条约的瓦解和崩溃已成定局；费了不少心血才在中东一小片地方培植起来的艾森豪威尔主义，眼看就要被彻底埋葬。于是逼得美国人连装扮一下也来不及，就血淋淋地登场了。没有“证据”也要下手，没有“直接侵略”的证据，就说有“间接侵略的威胁”；没有别的理由就说去保护侨民，总之，胡言乱语一通，仓仓惶惶地把兵派进了黎巴嫩去。人们不难看出，这是被中东人民革命形势所逼出来的“下策”。被长久奴役的中东人民，能用自己的力量，逼使世界上头号帝国主义，在世界人民面前赤裸裸地露出侵略者的尾巴来，这正足以说明那里人民的力量强大到了何等地步。被压迫的人们从这里也能获得必胜的信心。
    帝国主义的最后一手已经被逼耍出来了，这并没有什么可怕。也不应该对帝国主义抱有幻想，由它本身的要求所支使，它必然要在黎巴嫩动手放火，而且其主要目的，还在于从这里把战火燃向伊拉克去，以便挽救即将崩溃的巴格达条约。只有强大的世界人民立即行动起来，才能斩断这强盗的放火的手腕；任何的示弱是只能长小人之志的。
    美帝国主义敢于悍然地闯进黎巴嫩，自然还由于在它看来，黎巴嫩只不过是一个“小小的国家”，而它自己则是“庞然大物”。这是愚蠢的帝国主义自己在捉弄自己，它没有看到这个国家虽小，但是它所进行的反侵略斗争，却是正义的，因而一定得到全世界人民的支持，力量就会大得无比。而帝国主义只不过是沧海中之一粟。英国、法国、以色列合起来之对于埃及，前者何尝不是“庞然大物”，后者何尝不是“小”的。结果是怎么样呢？敢问艾克和杜勒斯先生，曾有鹏程之志的艾登首相，是为了什么退休的呢？
    问题不在于孤立地看来谁大谁小，问题在于现在的世界已是东风压倒西风。紧急动员起来吧，世界爱好和平的人们，一定要浇灭美国强盗燃起的战争之火。我们是正义的。在战争中毁灭的将是不义的帝国主义者，不是我们。
