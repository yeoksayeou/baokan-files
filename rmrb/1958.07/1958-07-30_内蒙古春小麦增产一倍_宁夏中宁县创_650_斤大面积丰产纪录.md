Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 29th – Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's eight million mu of spring wheat has reported a widespread bumper harvest. It is estimated that the total wheat output in the region this year will reach over 1.6 billion jin, with an average yield of over 200 jin per mu, an increase of about 100% compared to last year, surpassing any year in Inner Mongolia's history. Currently, except for the northern foot of the Daqing Mountains and the Xilin Gol League, where temperatures are still low and wheat harvesting has not yet begun, the vast areas from the Hetao region of the Yellow River to the West Liao River basin have been fully harvested, with some areas basically completed.

People of all ethnic groups who are harvesting have been continuously reporting high-yield records to the Party and government leading departments of the autonomous region in recent days. As of the 27th, the following have broken Inner Mongolia's historical highest wheat yield per mu record (1,113.4 jin): Yongsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Damutou Township, Linhe County, achieved 2,007 jin per mu on 1.33 mu of wheat; Xingguang Cooperative in Xiaozhao Township, Linhe County, achieved 1,152 jin per mu on two mu of wheat; Xinmin Cooperative in Liusumu Township, Liangcheng County, achieved 1,149.6 jin per mu on 2.1 mu of wheat. In Balin Left Banner, 25,000 mu of wheat in 21 townships can achieve a yield of about 1,000 jin per mu. In Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative, Dukou Township, Dengkou County, 14.36 mu of wheat has already yielded an average of 842 jin.

According to an analysis by the Autonomous Region's Department of Agriculture, the characteristics of this year's bumper harvest in Inner Mongolia are: denser planting, better growth, and a significant improvement in the quality of wheat harvest compared to previous years. At the same time, members of all ethnic groups paid attention to careful harvesting and threshing. Farmers in many banners and counties in Bayannur League and Ulanqab League, where the wheat harvest has basically ended or is about to end, are stepping up the plowing of wheat stubble land and replanting buckwheat, millet and other crops.

This newspaper reports that Zhongning County in the Ningxia region achieved a large-scale bumper harvest this year with over 85,000 mu of spring wheat. After actual harvesting, the total output was over 55.5 million jin, with an average yield of 650 jin per mu. Many high-yield "satellites" emerged, including 1.1 mu with a yield of 4,626 jin per mu and 1.03 mu with a yield of 4,413 jin per mu. Preliminary statistics for the county show 12 mu with a yield of over 3,000 jin per mu and 2,400 mu with a yield of 1,000 to 2,000 jin per mu. The fact of the bumper harvest has inspired people's hearts. The people of the county are working hard day and night with the momentum of ten thousand horses galloping, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn crops.

    内蒙古春小麦增产一倍
    宁夏中宁县创650斤大面积丰产纪录
    新华社呼和浩特29日电　内蒙古自治区八百万亩春小麦普告丰收。据预计，今年全区小麦总产量能达到十六亿斤以上，平均每亩二百多斤，比去年增加约一倍，超过内蒙古历史上任何一年。目前除气温较低的大青山北麓、察哈尔盟尚未麦收外，从黄河后套到西辽河流域广大地区已全面收割，有的已基本结束。
    正在收割的各族人民，连日来不断地向自治区党政领导部门报告高产纪录。到27日止，已经突破内蒙古小麦亩产历史最高纪录（一千一百十三点四斤）的有：临河县达木头乡永盛农业社一亩三分三厘小麦亩产二千零七斤；临河县小召乡星光社二亩小麦亩产一千一百五十二斤；凉城县六苏木乡新民社二亩一分小麦亩产一千一百四十九点六斤。巴林左旗二十一个乡镇的二万五千亩小麦，亩产可以达到一千斤左右，磴口县渡口乡新华农业社已有十四点三六亩小麦平均打出八百四十二斤。
    据自治区农业厅分析，今年内蒙古丰收的特点是：密植多，生长好，麦收质量比往年大为提高。同时，各族社员在收割中注意了细收细打。麦收已经基本结束和即将结束的巴彦淖尔盟、乌兰察布盟许多旗县农民，正加紧翻麦茬地，复种荞麦、小青糜等作物。
    本报讯　宁夏地区的中宁县今年种植的八万五千多亩春小麦，获得了大面积丰产，实打结束，总产五千五百多万斤，平均亩产六百五十斤。涌现了不少高产“卫星”，有亩产四千六百二十六斤的一亩一分，亩产四千四百一十三斤的一亩零三厘等，全县初步统计亩产三千斤以上的十二亩，一千至二千斤的二千四百亩。丰产的事实鼓舞了人们的心，全县人民正以万马奔腾之势，夜以继日地苦战，力争秋作物全面大丰收。　（中共中宁县委）
