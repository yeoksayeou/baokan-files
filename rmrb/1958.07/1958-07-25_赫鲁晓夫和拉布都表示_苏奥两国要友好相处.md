Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 24th: According to TASS, the Austrian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bischoff, held a reception on the 23rd for the Austrian government delegation's visit to the Soviet Union.

Soviet leaders Khrushchev, Mikoyan, Kosygin, and others were invited to attend the reception.

The head of the Austrian government delegation, Prime Minister Raab, said in his speech that, thanks to the State Treaty signed three years ago with the active participation of the Soviet Union, Austria has undeniably embarked on a new path. He said that the Austrian people, like the people of all countries, eagerly look forward to ensuring peace and enhancing mutual understanding among all people, regardless of their nationality, race, or political beliefs. He noted with satisfaction that this visit is another successful step towards realizing these wishes.

Raab also said that since the conclusion of the State Treaty, the relations between the Soviet Union and Austria have developed on the basis of friendship and mutual understanding. The talks held between the representatives of the Soviet and Austrian governments in the past two days have helped to find some ways and means to develop this relationship more rapidly, especially to establish solid cooperation in the economic and cultural fields.

Khrushchev said in his speech that he believed that the Austrian government delegation's visit to Moscow would help further develop and strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries. He said that Austria's taking the path of neutrality was the right step, which brought benefits to the Austrian people and the country. The Soviet people sincerely hope that Austria will live in friendship and peace with all countries, pursue an independent foreign policy, and promote the easing of international tensions.

Khrushchev pointed out that it is gratifying that the Soviet and Austrian governments share the view that it is necessary to maintain and consolidate peace and prevent a devastating atomic war, which lays a good foundation for our close cooperation in the struggle to maintain and consolidate peace.

    赫鲁晓夫和拉布都表示
    苏奥两国要友好相处
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：奥地利驻苏联大使比萧夫23日为奥地利政府代表团访问苏联举行了招待会。
    苏联国家领导人赫鲁晓夫、米高扬、柯西金等应邀出席了招待会。
    奥地利政府代表团团长拉布总理在会上致词说，由于三年前在苏联积极参加下签订的国家条约，奥地利无可争辩地走上了新的道路，他说，奥地利人民同各国人民一样热切盼望保障和平和增进所有的人们之间的相互谅解，不管他们的国籍、种族或政治信仰怎样。他满意地指出，这一次访问是实现这些愿望的又一个成功的步骤。
    拉布又说，自从国家条约缔结以来，苏联同奥地利的关系在友好和互相谅解的基础上得到了发展。最近两天奥苏两国政府代表所进行的会谈帮助找到了一些道路和手段来更迅速地发展这种关系、特别是在经济文化方面建立牢固的合作。
    赫鲁晓夫在会上致词时表示相信，奥地利政府代表团这次访问莫斯科将有助于进一步发展和加强两国之间的友好关系。他说，奥地利走上中立道路是正确的步骤，这给奥地利人民和国家带来了好处。苏联人民衷心地希望奥地利同一切国家友好和平相处，实行独立的外交政策，并且促进国际紧张局势的缓和。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，值得高兴的是，苏奥两国政府对于必须维护和巩固和平、防止毁灭性的原子战争的观点是吻合的，这就给我们在为维护和巩固和平而斗争的问题上进行紧密合作打下了良好的基础。
