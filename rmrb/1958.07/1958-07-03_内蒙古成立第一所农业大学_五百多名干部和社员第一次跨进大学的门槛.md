    内蒙古成立第一所农业大学
    五百多名干部和社员第一次跨进大学的门槛
    据新华社呼和浩特2日电　内蒙古自治区第一所新型的土默特旗农业大学，7月1日在土默特旗沟门乡北只图村正式成立，并举行开学典礼。五百多名蒙古、汉等族男女乡社干部、复员军人和农业社员，第一次踏进了大学的门槛。
    这所大学是土默特旗党政部门和各族农民解放思想，破除迷信，在两个月内筹建起来的。中共土默特旗委第一书记阎兆麟任校长。学校教师除由内蒙古有关部门、下放干部和高等学校支援外，还聘请全国林业劳动模范张维垣等兼任。校舍和教学设备，除因陋就简就地取材外，并得到许多部门和高等学校的大力支援。学校还将建立实验农场、畜牧场、气象站、标本室和实验室等。这所学校的主要任务，是培养又红又专的乡社干部和具有真才实学的农业科学技术人材。
