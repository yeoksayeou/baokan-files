(Our newspaper Changsha, July 14th dispatch) Hunan Province has begun a large-scale harvest of early rice. As of July 11th, the province had harvested 27,824 mu of early rice, of which 20,863 mu had been threshed, producing a total of 14,850,900 jin of dried grain, with an average yield of 711.8 jin per mu. In the Xiangtan Special District, 14,203 mu were harvested and 7,242 mu were threshed, yielding a total of 5,630,000 jin of dried grain, averaging 777.4 jin per mu. Among these, 321 mu inspected in Yueyang County yielded an average of 1,100 jin of dried grain per mu.

High-yield records continue to emerge across various regions. The Daxing Cooperative in Datong City Township, Qidong, harvested six mu of land, averaging 2,200 jin of dried grain per mu. Liu Yihe, the leader of the Seventh Team of the Shaluo Cooperative in Jingang Township, Liuyang, cultivated a 1.04 mu experimental plot, averaging 2,538 jin of dried grain per mu, which is 5.53 times the actual yield of the same plot last year. A 0.2 mu plot in the Panchun Cooperative, Panchun Township, translates to a yield of 3,800 jin per mu. A 0.522 mu plot in the Xianfeng Cooperative, Meixi Township, Yueyang, translates to a yield of 4,263 jin per mu.

During the harvest days, the broad masses of peasants are filled with joy and enthusiasm. Seeing the fruitful results of their hard work, they cannot suppress their joy. An old man in Yueyang, over eighty years old, excitedly said: "I've seen several emperors, but I've never seen rice like this year's. One season of early rice weighs a thousand jin, who knows how much the late rice will produce." This is a true reflection of the high spirits of the broad masses of the people. Under this victorious situation, the "wait-and-see faction" and the "settle-accounts-after-the-harvest faction" are rendered speechless and have to admit defeat. Huang Jiuxian, an upper-middle peasant member recently admitted to the Longshaping Cooperative in Yizhang, did not believe the cooperative's early rice could yield 700-800 jin or even over 1,000 jin per mu before joining. He even openly bet with the cooperative members: "If your early rice can yield a thousand jin of grain, I will cook rice with my bare hands to feed you!" When the cooperative harvested, they specially invited him to help with the harvest. After the harvest, Yan Changrui, the deputy secretary of the township Party committee in charge of the cooperative, asked him to estimate the yield of the early rice. He said embarrassedly: "No, these neat rice seedlings are full of grains. My old eyes can't see accurately."

    湖南大收丰产早稻
    两万亩平均亩产七百斤
    本报长沙14日电　湖南全省早稻已经开始大收。截至7月11日止，全省已收割早稻两万七千八百二十四亩，其中脱粒的两万零八百六十三亩，共产干谷一千四百八十五万零九百斤，平均亩产七百一十一点八斤。湘潭专区收割的一万四千二百零三亩，脱粒的七千二百四十二亩，共收干谷五百六十三万斤，平均每亩七百七十七点四斤，其中岳阳县验收的三百二十一亩，平均每亩产干谷一千一百斤。
    各地高额丰产纪录不断涌现。祁东大同市乡大兴社收割的六亩田，平均每亩产干谷二千二百斤。浏阳金刚乡沙螺社第七队队长刘宜和作的一点零四亩试验田，平均亩产干谷二千五百三十八斤，等于这丘田去年实产量的五点五三倍。泮春乡泮春社零点二亩田，折合亩产三千八百斤。岳阳梅溪乡先锋社零点五二二亩田，折合亩产四千二百六十三斤。
    在丰收的日子里，广大农民喜气洋溢，热情奋发，他们亲眼看到苦战的果累累，谁也压抑不住满怀的喜悦。岳阳有个八十多岁的老翁兴奋地说：“皇帝见了好几个，从冒见过今年的禾，一季早稻扮千斤，谁知晚稻产好多。”这正是广大人民意气风发的真正写照。在这种胜利的形势下，“观潮派”和“秋后算账派”理屈词穷，不得不认输了。宜章龙沙坪社最近新吸收的上中农社员黄九贤，在入社前，他不相信社里早稻能扮七、八百斤和一千多斤的事实。他甚至公开和社员打赌：“你们的早稻能收千斤谷，我拿手掌煮饭请你们吃！”社里收割时，特地请他到社里扮禾；收割后，办社的乡党委副书记颜昌瑞请他估估早稻的产量，他不好意思地说：“不行了，这样崭齐的禾苗，粒粒饱满，我这双老眼睛看不准了。”
