Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: A Leap Forward Gift-Presenting Conference was held by the Ministry of Culture in Beijing on the 16th, attended by 8,000 staff members. At the conference, representatives from the Ministry of Culture and over sixty affiliated institutions and enterprises joyfully presented more than 13,000 inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals from the staff to the Communist Party of China.

This conference was a review of the achievements of the rectification movement in the Ministry of Culture over the past year, and also a sign that the Ministry of Culture, after the rectification movement, has immediately launched a mass technical revolution and cultural revolution upsurge.

The rectification movement in most units of the Ministry of Culture came to an end in early July. On July 9th, the Party Group and Party Committee of the Ministry of Culture mobilized all staff to implement the Party's General Line, carry out technical and cultural revolutions, and build a socialist national new culture. After a week of hard work, the staff put forward more than 13,000 gifts, some of which have reached or exceeded international advanced levels.

The gift-presenting conference began in the music of "Socialism is Good". Qian Junrui, Secretary of the Party Group and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, said that this Great Leap Forward is a new leap forward, which marks the victory of the great rectification movement and blows the horn of technical and cultural revolutions in the cultural system. He said that cultural and artistic workers, under the leadership of the Party, should continue to exert great effort, break superstitions, liberate their minds, boldly innovate, and boldly create, to cooperate with the national industrial and agricultural Great Leap Forward, strive to popularize a socialist national new culture throughout the country in the shortest possible time, and catch up with international advanced levels in all aspects.

Then, the representatives, holding plaques and gifts, entered the venue in waves of applause. In the gift-presenting team of the film system, the staff of the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio carried a photo of the newly trial-produced six-channel low-resistance mixing and recording console. The quality of this console exceeded that of the famous British "GBK" recorder, and the cost was less than one-tenth of that of the "GBK". Young staff members of the factory also successfully tested the double-film development method and the rapid development method, the latter of which increased development efficiency by 164 times. Employees of the Beijing Film Studio, with the help of Soviet experts, developed a dyeing method for printing black and white films into color films, greatly reducing costs. Hu Benyuan, an employee and member of the Communist Youth League of the "August First" Film Studio, created a remote controller that automates tape recorders, which is also a domestic initiative. According to the further revised Leap Forward indicators of various units, all employees of the film department will break the original plan this year and produce 89 feature films, more than 700 newsreels and documentaries, and more than 120 science and education films.

The gifts of the surging publishing sector employees also attracted everyone's attention. The People's Publishing House proposed to change its appearance with two years of hard work. The representative of the People's Literature Publishing House held up eighty-eight kinds of books published in a seven-day and night blitz. These publications took the promotion of the General Line as the key link, had a clear political character, and most of them were written by the masses. Employees of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House increased the number of themes for General Line propaganda paintings by 289 in three days of hard work, and the number of propaganda paintings issued jumped from 10,000 to more than 1 million. Employees of the Commercial Press, Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Distribution Office, Xinhua Printing Factory, and Fine Arts Printing Factory also presented gifts to the conference.

In order to cooperate with the movement of studying Chairman Mao's works, the Beijing Library compiled the "Catalogue of Chairman Mao's Works and Reference Books", and also compiled and printed a catalog of books to cooperate with the rural technical revolution and cultural revolution.

In the gift-presenting teams of various art troupes, the Central Experimental Opera House showed their achievements in performing for workers, peasants, and soldiers and striving for self-sufficiency. The scripts written by the China Pingju Theater in the first half of this year increased by twelve times compared with last year. The slogan put forward by the China Youth Art Theater is "to make the theater a communist red theater, to ensure that the theater is always 'the East Wind raises the red flag,' and to comprehensively leap forward in ideology and work." The China Peking Opera Theater decided to vigorously compile and perform Peking Opera reflecting modern life and promote the comprehensive reform of Peking Opera art. The theater will compile eighty modern dramas this year. The Northern Kunqu Opera Theater is determined to rejuvenate the ancient Kunqu opera, and they have completed the rehearsal of the modern drama "Hongxia" in sixty-three hours. The Beijing Chinese Painting Academy presented to the Party works such as "A Distant View of the Ming Tombs Reservoir" painted by all twenty-three painters of the academy in five days and nights of hard work. In addition, the Central Song and Dance Troupe, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra, the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and the Beijing Dance School also presented gifts to the conference.

Employees of the Bureau of Cultural Relics and affiliated museums, the Palace Museum, the History Museum, the Revolution Museum, and other units also put forward a large number of suggestions for improving display work and research work, and a large number of inventions and creations. Jing Qingsheng and other six workers from the Ancient Architecture Repair Institute created a universal model making machine, which also realized the mechanization of replicating exquisite ancient architectural models.

    文化界百花争艳气象新
    向党献礼一万三千多件
    据新华社17日讯　文化部16日在北京举行有八千职工参加的跃进献礼大会。会上，文化部和所属六十多个事业、企业单位的代表，欢天喜地地把职工们最近的一万三千多件发明创造和合理化建议献给中国共产党。
    这次大会是文化部一年来整风运动收获的检阅，也是文化部在整风运动之后紧接着又掀起群众性的技术革命、文化革命高潮的标志。
    文化部大多数单位的整风运动是在7月上旬告一段落的。中共文化部党组、党委在7月9日动员全体职工贯彻执行党的总路线，开展技术革命和文化革命，建设社会主义的民族的新文化。经过一周以来的苦战，职工们提出了一万三千多件献礼，其中有一部分已经达到或超过了国际先进水平。
    献礼大会在“社会主义好”的乐曲声中开始，中共文化部党组书记、文化部副部长钱俊瑞说，这次大跃进是一次新的跃进，它标志着伟大整风运动的胜利，在文化系统中吹起了技术革命、文化革命的号角。他说，文化艺术工作者要在党的领导下，继续鼓足干劲，破除迷信，解放思想，大胆革新，大胆创造，配合全国工农业大跃进，争取在最短时期内在全国范围普及社会主义的民族的新文化，并且在各方面赶上国际先进水平。
    接着，代表们举着牌匾和礼品在一阵阵掌声中陆续走进会场。在电影系统的献礼队伍中，中央新闻纪录电影制片厂的职工抬着新试制成功的六路低阻混合录音调正台的照片，这个调正台的质量超过了著名的英国的“GBK”录音机，成本还不到“GBK”的十分之一。这个厂的青年职工还试验成功了双片显影法和快速显影法，后者使显影时间提高效率一百六十四倍。北京电影制片厂职工在苏联专家帮助下研究出用黑白影片印染成彩色片的印染法，成本大大降低。“八一”电影制片厂的职工、青年团员胡本元制造了使录音机自动化的遥远控制器，这也是国内创举。根据各单位进一步修订的跃进指标，电影部门的全体职工在今年里将要突破原定计划，生产艺术片八十九部、新闻纪录片七百多本和科学教育片一百二十多部。
    猛进中的出版部门职工的礼品也很吸引大家的注意。人民出版社提出了苦战两年，改变面貌。人民文学出版社的代表高举着奋战七昼夜突击出版的八十八种图书，这些出版物以宣传总路线为纲，有鲜明的政治性，大部分是群众写作的。人民美术出版社职工在三天奋战中使总路线宣传画的选题增加了二百八十九种，宣传画发行数由一万跃增到一百多万。商务印书馆、新华书店北京发行所以及新华印刷厂、美术印刷厂等厂职工也都向大会作了献礼。
    北京图书馆为了配合学习毛主席著作的运动，编制了“毛主席著作及参考书目录”，同时还编印了配合农村技术革命、文化革命的图书目录。
    在各艺术团体的献礼队伍中，中央实验歌剧院显示了他们在深入工农兵演出，争取自给自足方面取得的成就。中国评剧院今年上半年编写的剧本比去年增长了十二倍。中国青年艺术剧院提出的口号是“使剧院成为一个共产主义的红色剧院，保证剧院永远是‘东风扬红旗’，思想、工作全面跃进”。中国京剧院决定大力编演反映现代生活的京剧，推动京剧艺术的全面改革。剧院今年要编八十出现代戏。北方昆曲剧院决心使昆曲这个古老的剧种变得年轻起来，他们已经用六十三小时完成了现代剧“红霞”的排练工作。北京中国画院以全院二十三位画家苦战五昼夜所画的“十三陵水库远景”等作品献给党。此外，中央歌舞团、中央乐团、中央戏剧学院、中央美术学院和北京舞蹈学校也都向大会献了礼。
    文物局和所属各博物馆和故宫博物院、历史博物馆、革命博物馆等单位职工也提出了大量改进陈列工作、研究工作的建议和大量发明创造。古代建筑修正所工人井庆升等六人创制了万能模型制作机床，使复制精巧的古建筑模型也实现了机械化。
    最后，各艺术表演团体作了“跃进文艺节目献礼”演出。（附图片）
