Beijing to Popularize Primary and Junior Secondary Education

Nearly Double the Enrollment of New Students This Year

Junior Secondary School Entrance Examination and Primary School Graduation Examination Held at the Same Time

(Our Newspaper) Beijing News – This year, regular secondary schools, specialized secondary schools, and secondary normal schools in Beijing will enroll more than 110,000 new students, an increase of approximately double compared to the same period last year. The number of primary school enrollments will increase from over 90,000 last year to 150,000. In this way, all school-age children and upper primary school graduates in Beijing will be able to enter primary and junior secondary schools, achieving universal primary and junior secondary education.

This year, regular senior secondary schools, specialized secondary schools, and secondary normal schools in Beijing have adopted a joint enrollment method, with registration beginning on the 7th of this month. Applicants can fill out applications for six desired schools simultaneously. This new student recruitment corrects the past tendency of emphasizing academics and neglecting politics. Each school will comprehensively consider the candidates' political performance, academic achievements, and health conditions to determine admission. If the initial enrollment of a particular school is insufficient, the remaining slots will be filled by soliciting additional applications. To effectively implement the class line, schools will prioritize the admission of children of workers and peasants. To ensure that each school has a certain number of core members among its new students, a portion of outstanding graduates will be recommended for admission without examination.

This year, to simplify the enrollment process, Beijing will combine the junior secondary school entrance examination and the primary school graduation examination into one. The examination questions are uniformly set by the Beijing Education Bureau. Therefore, students who have obtained upper primary school graduation qualifications can be directly admitted to junior secondary school without examination. In addition, students in upper primary school supplementary classes affiliated with Beijing, as well as previous upper primary school graduates or candidates with equivalent qualifications, can also take the examination at the primary school in their district. The 150,000 school-age children will be enrolled after registration according to the principle of attending schools near their homes.

    北京市将普及小学和初中
    今年招收新生增加近一倍
    初中新生升学考试和小学毕业考试一次举行
    本报讯　北京市普通中学、中等专业学校和中等师范学校今年将招收十一万多名新生，约比去年同期增加一倍左右。小学的招生数将由去年的九万多名增加到十五万名。这样，北京市的学龄儿童和高小毕业生将可全部进入小学和初中；作到普及小学和普及初中。
    今年，北京市普通高级中学、中等专业学校和中等师范学校采取了联合招生的办法，在本月7日开始报名。报考的学生可以同时填写六个志愿学校。这次招收新生纠正过去只重业务、轻视政治的偏向。各校将综合考虑考生的政治表现、学业成绩和健康状况这三方面的条件，决定录取与否。个别学校一次招生不足，用征求志愿的办法，补足新生名额。为了切实地贯彻阶级路线，各校优先吸收工、农子女入学。并且使各校新生中有一定的骨干力量，将保送一部分优秀毕业生免试升学。
    今年为了简化招生工作，北京市将初中新生的升学考试和小学毕业考试合为一次举行，考试题是由北京市教育局统一规定的，因此取得高小毕业生资格的学生，都可免试升入初中。此外，北京市所属的高小毕业生补习班的学生，以及往年高小毕业生或同等学力的考生，也可以在所在地区小学参加考试。十五万名学龄儿童，根据就近入学的办法，报名后即可入学。
