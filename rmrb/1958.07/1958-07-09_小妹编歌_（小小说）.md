Little Sister Composes a Song (Short Story)
    Ba Jin

    Recently, in the streets of many cities, in the workshops of many factories, and on the walls of rural areas, a new type of literary publication has appeared. They have different names; some places call them "Street Literature," some call them "Poetry Flyers," and some call them "Worker-Peasant Literature,"... but they have a common characteristic: they are popular and easy to understand, everyone can read them, they are published quickly, everyone can see them, and they are cheap and everyone can afford them.

    These street literary publications also publish works by writers and poets, but most of them are by amateur worker-peasant authors. These are fresh flowers in our socialist literature and art publications. They are germinated by the east wind of the Great Leap Forward and grown up under the sunshine of the General Line.

    Today, we are reprinting some good works from street literary publications from various places for everyone to enjoy these fresh flowers. The editors have limited knowledge and must have missed many. We hope readers will all become flower pickers and recommend more.

    We respectfully wish this kind of flower, which is loved by the working people, to bloom all over the east, west, north, and south!	——Deputy Editor

    Little Sister returned home and excitedly said to her mother, "Mom, tomorrow I'm going to go to the street to promote the General Line."

    Her mother smiled and said, "You can promote it too? Can you explain it clearly?"

    Little Sister raised her head and said loudly, "Mom, you forgot that I'm twelve years old this year! The teacher even wants me to compose a song to sing on the street."

    Her mother smiled again and said, "You can even compose a song?" Actually, her mother was very happy inside.

    After dinner, Little Sister spread out paper on the dining table and first wrote the three words "General Line," then began to hum. She was humming the tune of the "Youth Waltz" that she was familiar with, and she tried to think of lyrics to fit this tune. She hummed it two or three times and thought about what the teacher had told the students today.

    "General Line, like the sun... shining brightly..." she hummed, slowly raising her head to look at the electric light. She seemed to see a red and big sun, emitting rays of golden light, illuminating everywhere... the future is bright and beautiful. She held the pen still, and muttered, "So good, so good." She simply put down the pen, held her chin in both hands, and imagined a good scene under the sun, and the more she thought about it, the happier she became, thinking of all the best things she could think of. She was laughing at the electric light by herself.

    Her mother called Little Sister to go upstairs to sleep. Little Sister was startled. She looked at the paper and pen in front of her and said to herself, "The worker uncles have to make new products, and they don't rest for days and nights. How can I sleep if I haven't even composed a song?"

    She stood up and went to close the door with a smile.

    Her mother finally came downstairs and walked to the door of the small room. The door was tightly closed, and Little Sister's happy singing could be heard from inside. Little Sister sang it over and over again, and her mother stood at the door, listening intently.

    小妹编歌  （小小说）
    巴金
    最近以来，在许多城市的街头，在许多工厂的车间，在农村的墙壁上，出现了一种新型的文艺刊物。它们的名称不同，有的地方叫“街头文艺”，有的地方叫“诗传单”，有的地方叫“工农文艺”，……但它有共同的特点：通俗普及，人人读得懂，出版迅速，人人看得到，价格低廉，人人买得起。
    这些街头的文艺刊物上，也刊登作家和诗人的作品，但是大部分是工农业余作者。这是我们社会主义文学艺术刊物的新鲜的花朵，它是大跃进的东风吹着发芽的，是总路线的阳光照着长大的。
    今天，我们转载了各地街头文艺刊物中的一些好作品，让大家欣赏这些鲜花。编者见闻有限，一定遗漏了许多，希望读者们都来做采花人，多多推荐。
    我们敬祝这一种为劳动人民喜闻乐见的鲜花开遍东南西北！  	——副刊编者
    小妹回到家，兴奋地对母亲说：“妈妈，明天我要上街宣传总路线。”
    母亲笑道：“你也会宣传？你讲得清楚吗？”
    小妹扬起头，大声说：“妈妈，你忘了我今年十二岁啦！老师还要我编个歌上街唱。”
    母亲又笑道：“你还会编歌？”其实母亲心里很高兴。
    吃过晚饭，小妹在饭桌上摊开纸，先写上三个字“总路线”，就哼起来。她哼的是她熟习的“青年圆舞曲”的调子，她将就这个调子去想词。她哼了两三次，又把老师今天对同学们讲的话想了一遍。
    “总路线，像太阳……光芒四射……”她哼着，慢慢地抬起头望着电灯。她好像看见了一颗又红又大的太阳，发出来万道金光，到处都照亮了……前面光辉灿烂真好看。她拿着笔不动，口里念着：“真好，真好。”她索性放下笔，两手托着下巴，在想像太阳下面的一片好景象，越想越高兴，把所能想到的最好的事情全想到了。一个人对着电灯在发笑。
    母亲在上面喊小妹上楼睡觉。小妹吃了一惊。她看着面前的纸笔，就自言自语：“人家工人叔叔要制造新产品，几天几夜都不休息，我连一首歌也没有编好怎么能睡觉？”
    她站起来含笑地走去关上了房门。
    母亲终于下楼来，走到了小房间门口。房门关得紧紧的，里面传出来小妹的快乐的歌声。小妹一遍又一遍地唱着，母亲站在门口听得出神了。
