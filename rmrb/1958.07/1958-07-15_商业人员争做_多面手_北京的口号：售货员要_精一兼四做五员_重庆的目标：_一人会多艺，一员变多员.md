    Commercial Personnel Strive to Become "All-Rounders"
    Beijing's Slogan: Shop Assistants Should "Be Proficient in One Skill, Versed in Four, and Act as Five Personnel"
    Chongqing's Goal: "One Person Mastering Multiple Skills, One Employee Transforming into Multiple Employees"
    (Our dispatch) Beijing, July 14th – Over 1,300 representatives of commercial and service industry workers in the capital held a rally on the 14th to march towards becoming "all-rounders." They expressed their determination to "be proficient in one skill, versed in four, and act as five personnel," meaning that each salesperson should be proficient in the specifications, quality, performance, characteristics, origin, use, storage, and usage methods of the goods they handle, while also serving as administrators, coordinators, repair technicians, and propagandists.

    Zhao Weixin, secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the Tianqiao Department Store, introduced their experience in learning to become "all-rounders" at the meeting. She said that the seventeen young people in the Tianqiao Department Store have mastered the knowledge of all the goods in their group (800 to 1,200 items) and the main goods of other related groups; learned the repair skills for some goods; learned the skills of one or more management tasks; basically grasped the rules and operating techniques of the group's goods in terms of purchasing, sales, and inventory; and have also reached a certain level in sales techniques, commodity storage, and commodity display techniques.

    The youth representatives of this department store then proposed that the young employees of the city's commercial and service industries hold high the red flag of "all-rounders" and leap forward again. The broad masses of young employee representatives immediately responded. Representatives from many units, such as the Mishi Street Non-staple Food Store and the Wangfujing Department Store, also expressed their determination to become "all-rounders" at the meeting.

    (Our dispatch) Chongqing, July 14th – More than 40,000 state-owned and joint state-private commercial workers in Chongqing are widely carrying out a learning campaign of "one person mastering multiple skills, one employee transforming into multiple employees."

    Cotton fabric retail stores have opened tailoring training classes. The first batch of salespersons participating in the learning have learned to cut more than ten to seventy different styles of clothing. Now, Huahua, Xiaoshizi, Guanyinyan and other three fabric stores have implemented a clothing tailoring service for customers, and one salesperson can do two jobs. Salespersons in pharmacies used to only sell medicine. Now, salespersons in the two larger pharmacies in Jiefangbei and Zourong Road are able to take patients' temperatures, measure blood pressure, give injections, and treat general minor illnesses.

    In the process of streamlining institutions, wholesale units have generally implemented the method of combining multiple personnel into one and transforming one employee into multiple employees. For example, the Pharmaceutical Wholesale Station abolished departments and established four specialized groups for needle medicine, powder medicine, tablet medicine, and liquid medicine, respectively. Each group is responsible for the entire process from ordering and purchasing to allocation and wholesale. The business personnel in each group can generally learn the entire set of business skills related to commodity circulation, including operation, allocation, planning, statistics, accounting, pricing, storage, and procurement. The employees of the Vegetable Company are salespersons in their own unit, and when they are stationed in agricultural cooperatives in the countryside, they become vegetable producers, policy propagandists, vegetable purchasers, and accountants. This learning movement has now become an important part of the technological and cultural revolution in various units. Many units have proposed to achieve "six modernizations" as a goal for further efforts, namely, comprehensive business and technical skills, diversification of service items, simplification of procedures and systems, rationalization of labor organization, scientific management, and mechanization of manual operations.

    The promotion of the "one person mastering multiple skills, one employee transforming into multiple employees" learning movement in the city's commercial departments has greatly unleashed the potential of commercial workers and has also brought convenience to customers. Although the commercial departments transferred 41% of their personnel to run factories and support various construction projects this year, they still overfulfilled the commodity circulation plan in the second quarter.

    商业人员争做“多面手”
    北京的口号：售货员要“精一兼四做五员”
    重庆的目标：“一人会多艺，一员变多员”
    本报讯　首都一千三百多名商业和服务业职工代表，14日举行了向“多面手”进军大会。他们表示要“精一兼四做五员”，即每个售货员要精通自己所经营的商品的规格、质量、性能、特点、产地、用途、保管和使用方法等知识，同时要兼作管理员、协作员、修理技术员和宣传员。
    天桥百货商场团支部书记赵维新在会上介绍了她们学做“多面手”的情况。她说，天桥百货商场的十七名青年已经掌握了本组全部商品（八百至一千二百多种）和其他有关小组的主要商品的知识；学会了对一些商品的修理技术；学会了一种和多种管理业务的本领；基本上掌握了本小组商品的进货、销货、存货规律和操作技术；在售货技术、商品保管和商品陈列技术方面，也都达到了一定水平。
    这个商场的青年代表，接着倡议全市商业和服务业的青年职工高举“多面手”的红旗向前再跃进。广大青年职工代表立即响应。米市大街副食品商店、王府井百货商店等许多单位的代表，也在会上表示了要做“多面手”的决心。
    本报重庆14日电　重庆市四万多名国营和公私合营商业工作人员正广泛地开展一个“一人会多艺，一员变多员”的学习运动。
    棉布零售商店开办了裁衣专业训练班，第一批参加学习的售货员已学会了裁剪十多种到七十多种服装式样。现在华华、小什字、观音岩等三个布店已经实行代客裁衣，一个售货员能干两种活了。药房的售货员原来只会售药，现在解放碑和邹容路两个较大药房的售货员，能够替病人量体温、量血压、打针、看一般小病了。
    各批发单位在紧缩机构中普遍实行了多员合一、一员变多员的办法。如医药批发站撤销科室，以针药、粉药、片药、水药分别成立四个专业组。各个组从订货、采购到调拨、批发工作一竿子管到底，各个组的业务人员可以普遍学会经营、调拨、计划、统计、会计、物价、保管、采购等全套商品流转的业务技能。蔬菜公司的职工在本单位是推销员，下乡驻农业社就成了蔬菜生产员、政策宣传员、蔬菜采购员和会计员。这个学习运动目前已成为各单位开展技术革命和文化革命的重要内容。许多单位提出实现“六化”，即业务技术全能化，服务项目多样化，手续制度简便化，劳动组织合理化，经营管理科学化，手工操作机械化，作为进一步努力的目标。
    全市商业部门推行“一人会多艺，一员变多员”的学习运动，大大发挥了商业工作人员的潜力，也给顾客带来了方便。商业部门今年虽然抽调了41％的人员办工厂和支援各项建设，但是第二季度仍然超额完成了商品流转计划。
