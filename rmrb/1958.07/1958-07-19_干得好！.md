    Well Done!
    Wang Dasheng
    Well done, Lebanese People's Army! On the 16th, the American aggressor troops occupied the Pan American Building and fired at the Lebanese People's Army. The People's Army didn't stand on ceremony and fought back resolutely. They killed nine American soldiers and wounded many more. This forced the American aggressor troops to retreat and withdraw from the Pan American Building and Parliament Square.
    Well done, Lebanese People's Army! On the 17th, a vehicle of American aggressor troops dared to break into the People's Army controlled area. The People's Army didn't stand on ceremony and captured the vehicle and all the people in it. They warned the American aggressor troops that they would be held “fully responsible for any such attempts.”
    Well done, Lebanese people! Resolutely resist, unyielding, explosions near Parliament Square and the Parliament Building resound louder and louder.
    Well done! Well done! Well done! Only by resolutely hitting the noses of the aggressors will they dare not run wild!

    黎巴嫩人民军干得好！16日，美国侵略军侵占泛美大厦，向黎巴嫩人民军射击。人民军不客气，坚决地打。打死了九个美国兵，还打伤了他们许多人。迫使美国侵略军后退，撤出了泛美大厦和议会广场。
    黎巴嫩人民军干得好！17日，一车美国侵略军，胆敢闯进人民军控制区里，人民军不客气，连车带人全抓起来。警告美国侵略军：要对“任何这样的企图负全部责任。”
    黎巴嫩人民干得好！坚决抵抗，不屈不挠，议会广场和议会大厦附近的爆炸声声高。
    干得好！干得好！干得好！对于侵略者只有坚决打他们的鼻子，他们才不敢乱胡闹！
