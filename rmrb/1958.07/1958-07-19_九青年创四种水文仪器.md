Nine young people from the Nanjing Observation Team of the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office, organized a technical innovation group and launched a vigorous technical innovation campaign. In less than two months, they created four hydrological measurement instruments with great practical value, including an electromagnetic current direction meter, a sand pumping machine, and an automatic time clock. Among them, Zhou Yiqi, a 22-year-old fifth-grade technician, created the electromagnetic current direction meter, which made a significant contribution to breaking through the weak link in the national hydrological work, measuring the ring current, and strengthening the bank protection and collapse prevention work in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

The average age of these nine young people is only twenty years old, with two fifth-grade technicians and seven third-grade assistant technicians. They all started learning hydrological surveying and mapping techniques after joining the workforce.

Zhou Yiqi began to get in touch with the current direction meter from the time when an advanced worker from the Nanjing Observation Team created a spark-type current direction meter. In the process of learning, he was not superstitious. From the beginning, he found that it still had significant shortcomings and was determined to improve it. He wanted to use the principle of resistance value to determine the azimuth angle to create a new type of current direction meter. After more than twenty days of hard work, the first electromagnetic current direction meter in the country was finally born.

    九青年创四种水文仪器
    长江流域规划办公室南京观测队九个青年，组织技术革新组，大闹技术革新，在不到两个月的时间内，就创造出电磁式流向仪、打沙机、自动报时钟等四种有很大实用价值的水文测验仪器。其中二十二岁的五级技术员周益祺创造的电磁式流向仪，对攻破全国水文事业的薄弱环节，测验环流，加强长江中下游护岸保坍工作有重大贡献。
    这九个青年平均年龄只有二十岁，两个五级技术员，七个三级助理技术员。他们都是在参加工作后开始学习水文测绘技术的。
    周益祺开始接触流向仪，是从南京观测队一个先进工作者创造了跳火式流向仪开始的，在学习的过程中，他并没有迷信，一开始就发现它还有重大的缺点，就决心改进。他想利用电阻值确定方位角的原理，来创造出新型的流向仪。前后共经过二十多天的苦战，全国第一台电磁式流向仪终于诞生。
