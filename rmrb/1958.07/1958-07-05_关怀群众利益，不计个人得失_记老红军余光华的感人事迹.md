Caring for the Interests of the Masses, Disregarding Personal Gain
——Remembering the Touching Deeds of Old Red Army Soldier Yu Guanghua
By our reporters Li Jiuzhe and Liu Guanghui

One night in January of this year, the Youliang Agricultural Cooperative in Ganxian County, Jiangxi Province, held a meeting of its members to mobilize and organize them to launch a concentrated effort to dredge pond mud for fertilizer. The cooperative director said, "Tonight I will plant the red flag in the center of the pond, and tomorrow the production team that first reaches the red flag will carry it.” Yu Guanghua, an elderly cooperative member sitting in the front row, felt a surge of excitement. He thought to himself, "How can we carry that red flag?” He was so focused on this thought that he didn't realize the meeting had ended until the other members started to get up and leave.

The next day, before dawn, Yu Guanghua woke up the production team leader, who in turn woke up all the team members. Arriving at the work site, they immediately started working. Yu Guanghua was like a machine, swinging his hoe with all his might. Inspired and encouraged by Yu Guanghua, the team members worked even harder. By noon, the Sixth Production Team had indeed reached the red flag first. The team leader carried the red flag, and the members applauded with joy. At that moment, Yu Guanghua was extremely happy.

Yu Guanghua is sixty-one years old this year. He is a retired Red Army veteran who is now a farmer, and an old Communist Party member with twenty-three years of Party membership. Currently, he serves as the cooperative's supervisor and storekeeper.

Twenty years ago, in the spring, the Soviet regime in the village was besieged by White bandits, and young and middle-aged farmers enlisted in the army and went to the front lines. At that time, Yu Guanghua, then thirty-four years old, left his wife and infant son, and joined the revolutionary ranks. For twenty years, Yu Guanghua worked as a cook in the revolutionary army. During the Long March, when the Red Army crossed the snowy mountains and grasslands, he boiled water and cooked grass roots for the soldiers. He often stayed up late to prepare meals, which caused him to develop eye problems.

After the liberation of the country, the leadership, to take care of his health, decided to let him do some light work or go to a sanatorium. But he did not agree. He said, "I don't want the Party and the state to support me for nothing; I come from a peasant family, please allow me to go home to engage in labor and production." At his firm request, the leadership agreed. So, in the winter of 1950, Yu Guanghua, carrying a small backpack and 800,000 yuan (old currency) in demobilization pay, returned to his hometown of Ganxian, Jiangxi.

When Yu Guanghua went to the district government to complete the settlement procedures, the district head, seeing that he was an old revolutionary comrade over half a century old, decided to let him do some work in the district. Yu Guanghua said, "Comrade District Head, I am returning home to participate in production and build my hometown." The district head had no choice but to give him a subsidy to buy 200 catties of rice to help him settle down. Because it was not long after liberation, and the lives of the masses were still very difficult, Yu Guanghua took the money for 200 catties of rice home and immediately lent it to poor peasants Ye Zengqi, Liu Bin, and other households in difficulty. The masses praised him, saying, "The old Red Army is really good!"

When Yu Guanghua returned home, the land reform movement was nearing its end. Like the masses, he was allocated three houses and more than one mu of land. He did not want any special treatment and settled down with his 800,000 yuan of demobilization pay.

In the eight years since he returned to farming, what the masses admired most about this old Red Army soldier was his down-to-earth revolutionary spirit and his selfless communist spirit.

In December 1955, the cooperative decided to build a reservoir at Xinshan (place name) that could irrigate 1,000 mu of paddy fields. This was the first reservoir built after the establishment of the advanced cooperative. The cooperative committee decided to complete the project before the Lunar New Year, and called on the cooperative members to work at night. Heavy snow fell in the winter nights, and the cold wind was bone-chilling, and some people's thinking was not clear.

"What to do?" Yu Guanghua wondered to himself. "Communist Party members take the lead!" He remembered the scene of Communist Party members leading the charge in the army in the past, and immediately had a plan.

At night, snow fell heavily, and the north wind howled. Yu Guanghua and several Communist Party members, led by the cooperative cadres, led a few young people to work in the wind and snow. Yu Guanghua was the first to take off his cotton coat, roll up his sleeves and trouser legs, and wield his hoe to dig through the ice and snow. Under his leadership, several people also took off their cotton coats and worked enthusiastically.

The next day, the incident spread among all the cooperative members, and they said, "Old Yu is working even at his age, we should work even more!" That night, the number of people working increased to more than forty. Yu Guanghua worked with the cooperative members every night, digging soil, carrying soil, and lifting soil. The road was rugged and uneven, and his eyesight was not good, so he sometimes lost his footing and fell while carrying soil. He got up silently, picked up the dirt basket, and continued to walk forward. Many cooperative members felt sorry for him and persuaded him to go home to rest, saying, "Now that there are so many people, it doesn't matter if you are missing!" He did not listen, saying, "One more person has the strength of one person."

The reservoir was finally completed ahead of schedule. The following year, the 1,000 mu of paddy fields irrigated by this reservoir avoided the autumn drought and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. People gratefully said, "This is all thanks to Old Yu's leadership."

Throughout the year, Yu Guanghua spent his days like this: he got up before dawn to collect wild manure in the fields, and after returning home, he fed the cooperative's cow grass. As soon as it was light, he would call the cooperative members to get up, and then he would go out to work. At noon, when the cooperative members rested, he would go up the mountain to cut grass for the cow. After returning, he would work together again; at night, whether it was the hot summer or the cold winter, he had to get up once or twice to feed the cow grass and water.

"Since Old Yu returned home, the sky has been getting brighter earlier." People in the village often said this.

Yu Guanghua worked diligently in production. In 1956, he earned 2,700 work points. Last year, although he was ill for two months and did not work, he still earned 2,000 work points, only 500 work points less than the strongest labor force in the cooperative. Last winter, the cooperative put forward the task of a great leap forward in production, and he became even more energetic. He attended work every day with the cooperative members, working early shifts and night shifts, and he never missed a single one. In the fertilizer accumulation movement, he accumulated nearly 400 loads of fertilizer, making him a model for fertilizer accumulation in the cooperative.

"Yu Guanghua is a lock for the cooperative!" "He takes better care of the cooperative's things than his own." The cooperative members praised Yu Guanghua, the storekeeper, in this way.

Last autumn, the cooperative members put the harvested rice and peanuts on a spacious lawn far away from the houses to dry. They dried it during the day and collected it at night, having to carry it back and forth twice a day, which was very laborious; if they didn't collect it, they were afraid it would be lost. What to do? Yu Guanghua had a plan. He asked the cooperative director, "Leave the crops on the lawn at night, and I will guard them."

The director was afraid that the cold at night would damage his health, but thinking that he was a man of his word, he had to agree.

On the autumn night, the wilderness was silent. Yu Guanghua lay in the small grass shed, watching the mountain-like piles of grain on the lawn, wiping his eyes from time to time to keep himself from falling asleep.

It was already late autumn, and gusts of cool wind blew into the grass shed. Yu Guanghua turned over and got out of the shed, and found that dew was falling. "Won't this wet the grain?" Yu Guanghua squatted down and touched the grain, which was wet. He immediately took the rice straw covering the shed and put it on the grain piles. He sat next to the grain piles until dawn.

Yu Guanghua is an old model for cattle raising in the cooperative. At a cooperative members' meeting in the spring of 1956, the cooperative members were assigned to raise cattle. All of the cooperative's twenty or so cattle had been assigned, leaving only one unusually weak buffalo. Because they were afraid it would die, no one wanted to raise it.

"Count me in!" Yu Guanghua said, pointing to the weak buffalo tied to the tree.

After Yu Guanghua took the cow back and raised it for half a year, it changed completely, growing fat and strong. The cooperative members said, "He even raised a dead cow back to life."

Does Yu Guanghua have a secret to raising cattle? No. If there is one, it is his meticulous care for public property.

In the winter, Yu Guanghua boiled warm water for the cow to drink, and at night, as in the summer nights, he got up twice as usual to feed the cow grass. In the summer, he smoked the cow to keep away mosquitoes every evening. During the spring plowing, autumn plowing, and winter plowing seasons, he insisted on cutting one or two loads of grass every day to feed the cow; during the busiest time of spring plowing every year, he even saved the sweet potatoes he ate to feed the cow in order to increase the cow's strength. Interestingly, this cow was often naughty when others took it to plow the fields, but it was very obedient when Yu Guanghua used it. People said that this was because the buffalo had a deep affection for him.

Yu Guanghua worked silently for everyone all the time. In the autumn of 1956, the youth shock brigade picked more than 360 catties of wet cotton from the fields, and after the accountant recorded the account in his book, the cotton was placed in a corner of the cooperative office, and no one cared about it anymore. At the end of the year's distribution, everyone thought that the cotton had long been moldy, and no one mentioned this income at all. Unexpectedly, Yu Guanghua quietly moved the cleaned cotton out of the storage room. It turned out that he had dried and stored it after discovering it. In this way, he added more than 100 yuan of income to the cooperative.

Once, after three days and three nights of heavy rain, a fish pond in the cooperative was breached by a flood, and the fish escaped from the pond with the water. Yu Guanghua was worried that the flash flood would break through the pond and the ridges, so he came with a hoe as soon as it was light. As soon as he discovered the breach in the fish pond, he immediately went into the water and blocked the breach. Then he rolled up his trouser legs and went into the paddy field to catch the escaped fish one by one and return them to the fish pond. People finished eating, and he staggered home. His clothes were soaked by the rain, and his waist was sore. But he didn't tell anyone about it.

Yu Guanghua usually treats his neighbors with enthusiasm and sincerity, and is willing to help others, so he has a very good relationship with the masses, and people are very happy to talk to him. Some people, seeing him working so hard, once joked to him, "Old Yu, you have been doing revolution for twenty years, you have suffered a lot, even if you don't have merit, you have worked hard! Now you are so old, why bother to work so hard? If you don't have anything to eat, go to the county magistrate to ask for relief, and you are still afraid that they won't give it to you!" Yu Guanghua smiled and said, "I'm not old yet, and now that I can work, I have to rely on work to make a living. The country is also in difficulty at the moment. If you want it too, and he wants it too, where does the country have so much relief money?" Others said to Yu Guanghua, "You are really not worth it. You did revolution for twenty years and went home to produce again, and you are still the same old self! You used to suffer, and you still suffer now. Look at others who have become high-ranking cadres. Why don't you go to the county to walk around and get a job, it's always better than farming." Whenever he encountered this kind of question, Yu Guanghua would directly say, "What's not worth it? In the past, I farmed the landlord's land, and was exploited and oppressed. My ancestors were poor for generations; I joined the revolution, defeated the enemy, and now I return to my own land to engage in labor and production and build a new countryside. This is a worthwhile thing!" Then he explained to people, "Being a cadre is not about enjoying happiness, it's about serving the people. We Communist Party members must obey the needs of the Party: in the past, the Party needed me in the army, so I was wholeheartedly in the army; now the Party needs me to farm, so I am wholeheartedly farming."

    关怀群众利益，不计个人得失
    ——记老红军余光华的感人事迹
    本报记者　李久泽　刘光辉
    今年1月间的一个夜里，江西省赣县优良农业社召开社员大会，动员和组织社员突击挑塘泥积肥。社主任说：“今晚我就把红旗插在塘中心，明天哪个生产队最先挑到红旗边，就扛红旗。”坐在前排中央的老年社员余光华，听后心里火辣辣的。他寻思：“怎样扛到这杆红旗呢？”全神贯注的用心思，社员们起身走时，他才知道散了会。
    第二天天没亮，余光华就去叫醒了生产队长，又分头叫起了全队队员。来到工地，人们马上开始了战斗，余光华好像开动的机器一样，抡起锄头用力挖。队员们受到余光华的感染和鼓舞，劲头更大了，干到中午，第六生产队果然最先挑到红旗边。队长扛着红旗，队员们高兴得用劲鼓掌，这时，余光华高兴极了。
    余光华今年六十一岁，是位解甲当农民的老红军战士，有二十三年党龄的老共产党员。现在，他是社的监察主任和保管员。
    二十年前的春天，村里的苏维埃政权遭到了白匪围攻，青壮年农民纷纷投军上前线。就在这时，三十四岁的余光华离别了妻子和未满周岁的儿子，投入了革命队伍。整整二十年，在革命队伍里余光华一直做着炊事员工作。在红军长征过雪山草地时，他给战士们烧过水，煮过草根。为了赶做饭菜，他经常熬夜，因此患上了眼疾。
    全国解放后，领导上为了照顾他的身体，决定让他做点轻微的工作，或者去休养。但他没有同意。他说：“我不愿意要党和国家白白养活我；我是农民出身，请允许我回家劳动生产。”领导上在他坚决的请求下，同意了。于是，在1950年冬季，余光华背着一个小背包，带着八十万元（旧币）复员费，回到了江西赣县老家。
    余光华到区政府办理安家手续时，区长见他是年过半百的老革命同志，决定让他在区里做点工作。余光华说：“区长同志，我回家是参加生产，建设家乡的。”区长没办法，为了给他安排生活，最后坚决给了他买二百斤大米的补助费。因为解放不久，当时群众的生活还很苦，余光华拿着二百斤大米的钱回家后，马上借给了贫农叶增其、刘斌等几个困难户。群众称赞地说：“老红军真是好！”
    余光华回家时，土改运动已近尾声了。他和群众一样，分得了三间房屋和一亩多土地；他不要一点特殊照顾，就用八十万元旧币复员费安下了家。
    在解甲归田的八年中，群众最敬佩这位老红军的是：踏踏实实的革命干劲，克己奉公的共产主义精神。
    1955年12月间，社里决定在新山（地名）修一个能灌溉一千亩水田的水库。这是成立高级社后兴修第一个水库。社委会决定要提早在阴历年前完工，号召社员夜晚上工。冬夜大雪纷纷，寒风刺骨，有些人思想搞不通。
    “怎么办？”余光华心里念叨着。“共产党员带头！”他记起了过去部队上共产党员带头冲锋陷阵的情景，马上有了办法。
    夜里，大雪纷飞，北风怒吼。余光华和社干部等几个共产党员带领着几个青年人冒着风雪上工了。余光华第一个脱下棉衣，卷起衣袖和裤脚，抡起锄头刨开冰雪挖土。在他带动下，几个人也都纷纷脱下棉衣，热火朝天地干了起来。
    第二天这件事在全体社员中传开了，他们说：“老余这么大岁数都出工了，我们更应该出工！”这天晚上出工的人增加到四十多。余光华夜夜和社员一齐上工，他挖土、挑土、抬土，样样都干。路途崎岖不平，再加上他的眼睛不好，有时挑土失足摔倒了，他不声不响地爬起来，挑起土箕又往前走。许多社员疼爱他，劝他回家休息，说：“现在来了这么多人，少你一个也不要紧呀！”他不听，说：“多一个有一个的力量嘛。”
    水库终于提早完工了。第二年，这座水库灌溉的一千亩水田，避免了秋旱，获得了空前的丰收，人们感激地说：“这多亏老余带头干。”
    一年四季，余光华每天是这样度过的：天不亮便起床到野外捡野粪，回家后给社里的一条牛喂草；天一亮他就去叫社员起床，接着就出工干活。中午，社员们歇晌了，他还要上山割牛草。回来后又一起出工；夜里，不论是炎热的夏天或者是寒冷的冬天，他一定要起床一、两次，给牛喂草、喂水。
    “老余回家后，天都亮得早了。”村子里的人经常这样说。
    余光华辛勤劳动生产，1956年得了两千七百个工分，去年他虽患病两月没有出工，仍得了两千个工分，比社里最强的劳动力只差五百个工分。去年冬季，社里提出生产大跃进的任务，他的干劲更大了。他天天和社员一起出勤，打早班、夜班，没有一次少了他；在积肥运动中，他积了近四百担肥料，是社里的积肥模范。
    “余光华是社里的一把锁！”“社里的东西比他自己的东西还保管得好。”社员们都这样称赞保管员余光华。
    去年秋天，社员们把收获的稻谷、花生，摆在离房屋较远的一块宽绰的草坪上晒。白天晒，晚上收回来，晒一天得挑去挑回两趟，第二天晒又要这样做，很费工；不收回吧，又怕丢失了。怎办呢？余光华有办法，他向社主任要求：“晚上把庄稼放在坪里，我去看守。”
    主任怕夜间天凉，搞坏他的身体，但想到他是说到做到的，只好答应了。
    秋夜，旷野间一片寂静。余光华躺在小草棚内，注视着草坪上小山似的谷堆，不时擦擦眼睛，不使自己入睡。
    季节到底是深秋了，夜里一阵阵凉风吹进草棚。余光华翻身起床走出棚子，发觉正在飘露水。“这不会把谷子淋湿了吗？”余光华蹲下来一摸谷子，湿漉漉的。他立刻把棚子上盖的稻草取下来盖到谷堆上。他就在谷堆旁边坐到天明。
    余光华是社里的老养牛模范。在1956年春天的一次社员大会上，分配社员饲养耕牛。社里的二十多条耕牛都分配完了，剩下的只有一条异常瘦弱的水牛。因为怕它死去，谁也不愿饲养。
    “算我的！”余光华用手指着那条拴在树上的瘦弱的水牛说。
    余光华把牛牵回去饲养了半年后，完全变了样，长得膘肥腿壮，社员们说：“死牛都给养活了。”
    余光华有养牛的秘密吗？没有。要说有，那就是：对公共财物的无微不至的爱护。
    在冬天里，余光华煮温水给牛喝，晚上也和夏夜一样，照例起床两次给牛喂草。在夏天，他每天傍晚给牛熏蚊子。春耕、秋耕、冬耕时期，他坚持每天割一、两担草喂牛；每年春耕最忙的时候，还把自己吃的番薯省下来给牛吃，以增强牛的体力。极有趣的是：这头牛被别人牵去犁田时，经常调皮，而余光华用它时，却非常服贴。人们说，这是因为这条水牛同他已经有了深厚的感情。
    余光华无时无刻不在默默地为大家工作。1956年的秋天，青年突击队从地里摘回三百六十多斤湿棉花，在会计员的账本上记了笔账后，就把棉花 摆在社办公室的角落里，再也没人管了。年终分配时，大家以为这些棉花早霉烂掉了，根本没有人提起这笔收入。事情出于大家的意外，余光华从保管室悄悄地搬出那些收拾得干干净净的棉花，原来是他发现后晒干保管起来的。就这样给社里添了一百多元的收入。
    有一次，接连下了三天三夜大雨，社里的一口养鱼塘被洪水冲破了个缺口，鱼随水逃出塘外。余光华耽忧山洪冲破水塘和田埂，天一亮就扛着锄头赶来了。他一发现鱼塘缺口，立即下到水里，把缺口堵上。又卷起裤脚下到稻田里，把逃出来的鱼一只只捉回鱼塘去。人们吃完了饭，他才颤颤抖抖地走回家。他的衣服被雨水淋湿了，腰也酸痛了。但他没有对任何人说过这件事。
    余光华平时对待乡亲们热心诚恳，肯帮助别人，因此同群众的关系非常好，人们很欢喜同他谈谈心。有的人见到他这样用力劳动过日子，曾经半开玩笑地对他说：“老余啊，你干革命二十年，吃过很多苦，没有功劳也有苦劳！现在又这么老了，何必拼着干？没有吃的就到县长那里去要救济，还怕他们不给你！”余光华笑了笑说：“我还不算老，现在能劳动就要靠劳动过日子。国家当前也很困难，如果你也要，他也要，国家那有那么多的救济钱？”还有的人对余光华说：“你真划不来啊，干了二十年革命又回家生产，还是个老样子！以前吃苦现在还是吃苦。你看别人都当上大干部，你还不去县里走动走动，搞个工作做总比种田好。”逢到这种问题，余光华便直截了当地说：“有什么划不来呢？过去我种地主的田地，受剥削受压迫，祖祖辈辈受穷；我参加革命，打垮了敌人，现在回到自己的田地上劳动生产，建设新农村，这是划得来的事！”接着他又向人们解释：“当干部也不是享福，是给人民服务。我们共产党员要服从党的需要：过去需要我在部队上，我就一心在部队上；现在需要我种田，我就一心种田。”
