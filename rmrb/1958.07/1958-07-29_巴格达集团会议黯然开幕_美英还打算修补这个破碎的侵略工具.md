Xinhua News Agency, London, July 28th: The Baghdad Pact Council meeting opened in London this morning in a somber atmosphere. The meeting will last for two days, two days shorter than originally planned. The chairman of the meeting, British Prime Minister Macmillan, said at the beginning of his opening speech, which lasted only two minutes, in a rather dejected tone, that the meeting was being held "under the shadow" of the recent events in Iraq.

After Macmillan's dozen or so sentences, he immediately announced that the meeting would proceed in secret.

In his opening speech, Macmillan indicated that the United States and Britain still intend to continue supporting this already fragmented tool of aggression. He said, "Our purpose is to reaffirm the intentions expressed in that treaty as a means of collective security. We intend to maintain the goals of our alliance..." However, he also stated that this military treaty would face "many difficulties" in the future, and the remaining member states of the group need to "consider what to do in the current situation."

On the eve of the meeting, Dulles busily held a series of secret talks with representatives of the participating countries and the Jordanian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Rifai.

According to Western news agencies, Dulles, in his talks with Macmillan and Lloyd, studied the situation in Lebanon and Jordan and discussed the next steps for the United States and Britain after sending invading troops to occupy Lebanon and Jordan. The talks also discussed the "future" of the Baghdad Pact and Khrushchev's proposed summit meeting, among other issues. It is said that it was during this meeting that they decided that they would continue to maintain the Baghdad Pact regardless of the fact that a revolution had taken place in Iraq.

    巴格达集团会议黯然开幕
    美英还打算修补这个破碎的侵略工具
    据新华社28日讯　伦敦消息：“巴格达条约”理事会会议今天上午在低沉的气氛中在伦敦开幕。这次会议将举行两天，比预定的缩短了两天。会议主席、英国首相麦克米伦在他的只有两分钟的开幕词中，一开始就灰溜溜地说，这次会议是在最近在伊拉克发生的事件的“阴影底下”举行的。
    麦克米伦的十几句话讲完后，立即宣布进入秘密会议。
    麦克米伦在开幕词中表示，美国和英国还打算继续扶植这个已经支离破碎的侵略工具。他说，“我们的目的是重申在作为集体安全的手段的那个条约中所表示的各项意向。我们打算维护我们的联盟的目标……。”不过他同时表示，这个军事条约今后将面临“很多困难”，这个集团的残余成员国需要“考虑在目前情况下采取什么做法”。
    在会议前夕，杜勒斯忙碌地同参加国的代表们和约旦驻英国大使里法伊进行了一连串的秘密会谈。
    据西方通讯社透露，杜勒斯在同麦克米伦和劳埃德的会谈中，研究了黎巴嫩和约旦的情况，并且讨论了美英在派遣侵略军占领黎巴嫩和约旦之后的下一步行动。这次会谈还讨论了“巴格达条约”的“前途”问题，以及赫鲁晓夫建议召开的政府首脑会议等问题。据说，就在这次会谈中，他们决定，他们将不顾伊拉克发生革命这个事实而继续维持“巴格达条约”。
