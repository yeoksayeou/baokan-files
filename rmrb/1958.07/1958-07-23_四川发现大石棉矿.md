Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 22nd: Sichuan Province recently discovered China's largest and one of the world's rarest asbestos mines. This asbestos mine contains proven reserves of 20 million tons of pure asbestos, with good quality and long fibers. In the past, the British considered 108-centimeter-long asbestos to be a "rare treasure," but in this large asbestos mine, there is asbestos as long as 150 to 180 centimeters. The mineral deposits are also very concentrated and can be mined in the open air.

    四川发现大石棉矿
    据新华社重庆22日电  四川省最近发现一个我国最大也是世界上罕有的石棉矿。这个石棉矿蕴藏的纯石棉储量达两千万吨，石棉的质量好，纤维长。过去英国人收藏到一百零八公分长的石棉，就认为是“稀世之珍”；而在这个大石棉矿里，却有长达一百五十到一百八十多公分的石棉。矿藏也很集中，可以露天开采。
