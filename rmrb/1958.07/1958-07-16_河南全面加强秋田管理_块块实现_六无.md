　　Zhengzhou, July 15th (This newspaper) – Henan province farmers, having harvested 23.2 billion jin of grain in the summer, are now conducting an autumn field management inspection and comparison campaign centered on "Six No's" (no missing seedlings or broken ridges, no waterlogging or drought, no barren or thin land, no weeds, no pests or diseases, no third-class crops) on over 120 million mu of autumn crops, to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest in the fall.

　　Currently in Henan province, 45 million mu of early autumn crops such as cotton, corn, sorghum, millet, and peanuts are already flowering and bearing fruit; over 80 million mu of late autumn crops are growing densely, sturdily, and vibrantly green. In Xuchang, the nationally renowned tobacco-producing area, the early tobacco seedlings are over five feet tall, with large and fertile leaves.

　　This year, the sowing quality and production conditions for autumn crops in Henan are better than in any previous year. Autumn land has generally been deeply plowed and finely harrowed. In the past, plowing depth was four to five inches, but this year it is six to seven inches. Over 20 million mu of land across the province has been deep-plowed to a depth of one foot or more, completely changing the historical habit of planting on un-tilled land for late autumn crops. The amount of base fertilizer applied to autumn fields has increased from 2,000-3,000 jin per mu in previous years to around 30,000 jin, with a total fertilizer application of over 4.5 trillion jin, a fourteen-fold increase compared to last year. This year, due to the vigorous promotion of improved varieties and close planting, the number of seedlings for various crops has increased exponentially. In the past, cotton had 2,000 plants per mu, but this year it has increased to 4,000-5,000 plants. Rice has changed from planting 10,000 seedlings per mu to 20,000 seedlings. Tobacco leaves have more than doubled from 1,100 plants per mu, and sweet potatoes have also increased from 1,300 plants per mu to 3,000 plants. Another favorable factor in this year's agricultural production is that the province has basically achieved water conservancy, and the bumper wheat harvest has liberated people's minds. This autumn, more than 300,000 cadres across the province are personally cultivating over 1 million mu of experimental fields, and "satellites" of high-yield crops are appearing everywhere. In addition, the field management of autumn crops in various localities, such as watering, topdressing, inter-row cultivation and weeding, and pest and disease control, has also been done early and well.

　　Currently, the first stage of autumn production in Henan Province – that is, the good planting stage from sowing to thinning and setting seedlings – has ended; the mid-term management stage of autumn field topdressing, weeding, pest control, and prevention of drought and flood disasters has begun. In order to fully implement technical measures for increasing the production of different crops, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee recently issued a joint notice to various localities on strengthening autumn field management and launching the "Six No's" comparison campaign. They also organized an inspection and comparison team of more than 200 people to go to various localities to inspect and assist in the work. Party and government at all levels are now holding professional on-site meetings for the production of different crops, using methods such as visits, comparisons, discussions, and big-character posters to summarize and exchange experiences, and propose different measures to increase production based on local conditions and the habits of various autumn crops, such as preventing cotton from growing excessively, eliminating empty corn stalks, and removing the lower leaves from sorghum and soybeans. Many prefectures, through inspection and comparison, have launched a large-scale autumn field management production competition between townships and between communes. 70%-80% of the 14 million mu of cotton fields in the region have achieved "Five No's" ahead of schedule – that is, no soil crusting, no weeds, no pests or diseases, no missing seedlings or broken ridges, and no excessive growth. Yanshi County, which has consistently ranked first in the province in wheat yield, is now concentrating its efforts on managing autumn crops. The farmers sing while working: With our feet on the globe, spinning round and round, autumn yields will skyrocket, striving to achieve "Triple Doubles" (double hundred jin of ginned cotton, double thousand jin of grain, double ten thousand jin of sweet potatoes) to present as a gift on Tiananmen Square.

    河南全面加强秋田管理
    块块实现“六无”
    本报郑州15日电　夏季收获二百三十二亿斤粮食的河南省农民，现正在一亿二千多万亩秋季作物的土地上开展一个以“六无”（无缺苗断垅、无水旱灾害、无瘦田薄地、无杂草、无病虫害、无三类作物）为中心的秋田管理检查评比运动，保证秋季全面大丰收。
    当前河南全省四千五百万亩早秋，如棉花、玉米、高粱、谷子、花生等已经开花结果；八千多万亩晚秋作物生长苗密、茁壮、青绿透人。全国著名烟产区许昌的早烟，苗儿高达五尺以上，叶大且肥。
    今年河南秋收作物播种质量和生产条件比以往任何一年都好。秋地普遍做到深耕细耙，过去犁地深度四至五寸，今年为六至七寸，全省深翻一尺以上耕地共有两千多万亩，彻底改变了历史上晚秋不灭茬耩白脸地的习惯。秋田施底肥量，由往年的每亩二、三千斤提高为三万斤左右，施肥总数达四万五千多亿斤，比去年增加十四倍。今年各地由于大力推行了良种、密植，各种作物的苗株数都成倍增加。过去棉花每亩两千株，今年增加到四、五千株，稻子由一万蔸改种为两万蔸，烟叶从每亩一千一百株增加一倍以上，红芋也在以往一千三百株的基础上提高为三千株。今年农业生产的另一个有利因素是，全省基本实现了水利化，小麦大丰收解放了人们的思想。今秋全省有三十多万名干部亲自动手培植试验田一百多万亩，各种作物高额丰产的“卫星”到处都有。另外，各地对秋作物的田间管理工作，如浇水、追肥、中耕锄草、防治病虫害也做得既早又好。
    目前，河南省秋季生产第一关——即从播种到间苗、定苗的种好关，已经结束；秋田追肥、锄草、治虫、防止旱、涝灾害等中期管理关，已经展开。为了全面贯彻不同作物增产的技术措施，中共河南省委和省人民委员会最近除了特向各地发出关于加强秋田管理开展“六无”评比运动联合通知外，并组织了二百多人的检查评比团，出发到各地检查和帮助工作。各级党政现正召开不同作物生产的专业现场会议，通过参观、评比、讨论、大字报等方法，总结与交流经验，根据本地情况和各种秋收作物的习惯，提出不同的增产措施，如棉花无疯长、玉米无空株、高粱、大豆要摘掉低帽子。许多专区通过检查、评比，掀起了乡与乡、社与社的秋田管理生产大竞赛。全区一千四百多万亩棉田有70％—80％都提前做到了“五无”——即地无结板、无杂草、无病虫害、无缺苗断垅、无疯长。历年小麦产量跃居全省第一位的偃师县，现正集中力量管理秋作物，农民们在劳动中唱着：足蹬地球团团转，秋季产量坐火箭，力争实现“三双”斤（双百斤皮棉，双千斤粮，双万斤红薯）天安门上把礼献。
