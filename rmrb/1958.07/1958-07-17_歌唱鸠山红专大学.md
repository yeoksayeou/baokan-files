    Singing the Praises of the Jushan Red and Expert University
    Labor Examination
    The fields and construction sites are battlefields,
    Determination and will are strength,
    Shouldering hoes and spades as weapons,
    Waging a great war of hard work, stronger than steel.
    The land is turned two feet deep,
    Fifteen mu of land completely overturned,
    Planting cotton to strive for a bumper harvest,
    A hundred catties of cotton per mu is set as the high-yield target.
    Self-Reliance, "Three No's"
    The half-work, half-study method is good,
    Building kilns to burn lime,
    Washing clothes, raising seedlings, doing odd jobs,
    Finding ways to be self-sufficient.
    Side-business income is two thousand three,
    Running the school and studying with the "Three No's." (Note)
    (Note) "Three No's" means not relying on the state, not relying on the agricultural cooperative, and not relying on the family.
    Frugal School Management
    Tianwang Mountain, Red and Expert School,
    Life depends entirely on our own efforts,
    High mountains, steep slopes, winding paths,
    We even have to go down the mountain to fetch water to drink.
    Carrying water to drink, not complaining of hardship,
    One person carries twenty loads a day,
    Digging wild vegetables to find supplementary food,
    Saving grain and eating our fill.
    Be an Ambitious Youth
    Ambitious youth compete in determination,
    Dedicate youth to building the motherland.
    Make great ambitions to train yourselves,
    Strive to be both red and expert.
    Study and practice diligently, hanging heads from the rafters,
    Establishing a rich foundation for building the mountainous areas.

    歌唱鸠山红专大学
    劳动考试
    田间工地是战场，
    决心意志是力量，
    扛起锨镢当武器，
    大战苦干比钢强。
    土地翻了二尺深，
    十五亩地全翻完，
    种上棉花争丰收，
    百斤皮棉定丰产。
    自力更生“三不靠”
    半工半读办法好，
    建窑来把石灰烧，
    洗衣、育苗、打小工，
    自给自足找门道。
    副业收入二千三，
    办学读书“三不靠”。（注）
    （注）“三不靠”即不靠国家、不靠农业社、不靠家庭。
    勤俭办学
    天王山，红专校，
    生活全凭自己搞，
    山高坡陡羊肠道，
    吃水也得下山挑。
    挑水吃，不辞劳，
    一人一天二十挑，
    挖野菜，副食找，
    节约粮食吃得饱。
    做个有志气的青年
    有志青年比决心，
    建设祖国献青春。
    立下大志要锻炼，
    力争红透又专深。
    苦学苦练头悬梁，
    建设山区扎富根。
