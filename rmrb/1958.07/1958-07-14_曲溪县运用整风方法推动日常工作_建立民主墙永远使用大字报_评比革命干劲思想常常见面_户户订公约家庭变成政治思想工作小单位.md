    Qu Xi County Uses Rectification Methods to Promote Daily Work
    Establishes Democracy Walls to Permanently Use Big-Character Posters
    Evaluates Revolutionary Zeal with Frequent Ideological Meetings; Every Household Signs Pacts, Transforming Families into Small Units for Political and Ideological Work
    (Our Reporter Zhang Tinggan reports) The Qu Xi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Yunnan Province, is implementing the good work style and methods formed during the nationwide rectification movement into regular mass political and ideological work, forming a system. This has played a good role in consolidating the achievements of the rectification movement and continuously boosting the revolutionary zeal of cadres and the masses.
    After the nationwide rectification movement, the broad masses of Qu Xi County liquidated the remnants of capitalist ideology and various unhealthy tendencies, and the work style of cadres generally improved. This drove the overall development of various tasks, enabling the county to quickly get rid of the passive and backward situation in its work within a short period of two months. In order to consolidate the achievements of the rectification movement, the Qu Xi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party seriously summarized the experiences of the nationwide rectification movement and implemented these experiences into regular mass political and ideological work, forming a system.
    These systems mainly consist of three parts. First, carry out a mass appraisal of revolutionary zeal, mobilize the whole party to help the backward learn from the advanced. Before launching the appraisal, Party grassroots organizations universally organized the masses to study the general line of socialist construction, enabling the masses to clarify various types of specific standards. The first category is: having sufficient zeal, great diligence, and being able to conscientiously implement the spirit of the general line; the second category is being basically able to complete tasks, but lacking outstanding zeal; the third category is lacking zeal, not moving without being pushed. Those in the first category should not be arrogant and should strive to be even more advanced; those in the third category should be treated with care and affection, and persuasion and education should be used, without discrimination or attack. The appraisal period is ten days for the masses and half a month for cadres. During the appraisal, the method of fully and extensively presenting facts, reasoning, and self-reporting for public discussion is adopted. After the appraisal, Party grassroots organizations immediately convene branch meetings to analyze the ideological trends of the masses, and through meticulous organizational work, mobilize all Party members and cadres to divide their work and conduct "three-guarantee education" for the third category of commune members (guaranteeing political ideology, attendance, and love for the country and the collective), so that the appraisal work is combined with meticulous organizational work and in-depth and detailed ideological work.
    Since May, the county has conducted three appraisals, which have enabled a large number of commune members in backward states to catch up with the advanced. Among the 15,326 people who participated in the first appraisal, 4,114 were rated as first category, 8,922 were rated as second category, and 2,290 were rated as third category. After three appraisals, 222 people in the county rose from the third category to the first category, 538 people rose to the second category, and the number of people in the third category decreased by 33%. Many Party members are very patient and meticulous when carrying out "three-guarantee education" for the third category of commune members, and some even work alongside them, talk heart-to-heart, and provide care and assistance in terms of ideology, production, and life. After Dongshan Township appraised 331 commune members as third category, 347 Party members, Youth League members, and cadres made friends with them and had heart-to-heart talks, and half of them rose to the first category within a month. In Limin Cooperative, one production team had an attendance rate of less than 60% due to incomplete rectification, and team leader Zhao Jincai was rated as third category. After several talks, the branch clarified the existing problems and helped solve them, and the team's attendance rate quickly rose to 100%, and Zhao Jincai was also rated as first category.
    Second, use the form of "Socialist Democracy Walls" to consolidate the habit of using big-character posters and continue to use them forever. Now, every township and cooperative has established democracy walls, and some townships have one in each production team. Each democracy wall generally has three to five columns, such as airing views, commendations, and rectification. Because the masses are accustomed to using the weapon of big-character posters, the democracy walls in various townships and cooperatives are immediately filled with big-character posters as soon as they are established. In the first ten days after the establishment of the democracy walls, various townships and cooperatives posted more than 5,000 big-character posters. During larger-scale debates, some townships and cooperatives also hung big-character posters in the fields to supplement the shortage of democracy walls.
    Third, every household signs a "Four Loves Pact" (love the country, love socialism, love the collective, love the family), transforming each family into a small unit for political and ideological work. Each mass appraisal takes the quality of the implementation of the pact as one of the main bases. Therefore, many families hold family meetings before the appraisal to check the implementation of the pact; after the appraisal, they discuss family "rectification" based on the opinions of the masses. Therefore, many townships and cooperatives have seen a new atmosphere of frugality in managing households, saving food, family members helping and educating each other, and households carrying out competitions with each other.

    曲溪县运用整风方法推动日常工作
    建立民主墙永远使用大字报
    评比革命干劲思想常常见面　户户订公约家庭变成政治思想工作小单位
    本报讯　记者张廷干报道：中共云南省曲溪县委把全民整风运动中形成的好作风、好方法，贯彻到经常性的群众政治思想工作中去，并使它形成一套制度。这对巩固整风运动成果，继续不断鼓足干部和群众的革命干劲，起了良好的作用。
    经过全民整风运动，曲溪县广大群众清算了资本主义思想残余和各种歪风邪气，干部作风普遍有了改进。从而带动了各项工作的全面发展，使这个县在短短两个月内很快地摆脱了工作中的被动落后局面。中共曲溪县委为了巩固整风运动的成果，认真总结了全民整风运动的经验，并把这些经验贯彻到经常性的群众政治思想工作中去，使它形成一套制度。
    这些制度主要有三个部分。第一，进行全民革命干劲大评比，全党动员帮助落后向先进看齐。在开展评比以前，各个党的基层组织普遍组织群众学习了社会主义建设总路线，使群众弄清各种类型的具体标准。一类条件是：干劲足，钻劲大，能够认真贯彻总路线精神；二类是基本上能完成任务，但干劲不突出；三类是没有干劲，不推不动。对一类提出要不骄傲，争取再先进；对三类采取关心爱护和说服教育的态度，不歧视、不打击。评比期限，群众十天一次，干部半月一次。在评比时，采取充分大量地摆事实，讲道理，自报公议的办法。在评比以后，党的基层组织立即召开支部大会，分析群众思想动向，通过周密的组织工作，把所有党员、干部动员起来分工对三类社员进行三包教育（包政治思想、出勤和爱国爱社），使评比工作和周密的组织工作、深入细致的思想工作结合起来。
    5月份以来，全县进行了三次评比，已经使大批处在落后状态的社员赶上了先进。第一次参加评比的一万五千三百二十六人中，有四千一百一十四人评为一类，八千九百二十二人评为二类，二千二百九十人评为三类。经过三次评比，全县就有二百二十二人从三类升为一类，五百三十八人升为二类，三类人数下降了33％。许多党员对三类社员进行三包教育时，都非常耐心细致，有的还和他们一起出工，谈心，从思想、生产和生活方面给以关怀帮助。东山乡评比出三百三十一个三类社员后，有三百四十七个党、团员和干部同他们交朋友谈知心话，一个月内就有一半人上升为一类。利民社一个生产队由于整风不彻底，出工率不到60％，队长赵进才被评为三类。经过多次谈话，支部摸清了存在的问题并帮助解决以后，这个队的出工率很快就上升到百分之百，赵进才也被评为了一类。
    第二，用“社会主义民主墙”的形式，把大字报的习惯巩固下来，永远使用下去。现在，乡乡社社都建立起了民主墙，有的乡每个生产队都有一个。每个民主墙一般都有鸣放、表扬、整改等三个到五个栏。由于群众习惯运用大字报这个武器，各乡、社的民主墙一建立，就马上贴满了大字报。在民主墙建立的头十天，各乡、社就贴出大字报五千多张。在进行较大规模的辩论时，有的乡、社还把大字报挂到田间去，以补充民主墙的不足。
    第三，家家户户订“四爱公约”（爱国、爱社会主义、爱社、爱家），把每个家庭变成政治思想工作的小单位。每次全民评比，都把执行公约的好坏作为主要依据之一。因此，许多家庭在评比以前，都开家庭会议，检查执行公约的情况；评比后，又根据群众意见讨论家庭“整改”。因此，许多乡、社都出现了勤俭持家、节约粮食、家庭成员互相帮助教育和户与户开展竞赛的新风气。
