    Mongolian Horses
    In order to support China's agricultural production, the Mongolian People's Republic has exported a total of 178,000 horses to China over the past eight years, starting in 1951.

    Most of these horses have been supplied to provinces such as Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Liaoning, and Jilin. These horses, which originally galloped on the Mongolian grasslands, are now serving China's agricultural production.

    Mongolian horses have the characteristics of being: hardworking, strong, and easy to feed, and are very popular among the vast number of agricultural cooperatives. Some people were initially worried that Mongolian horses were wild and would not work, but it was not as they imagined. Mongolian horses raised by many agricultural cooperatives in Shandong, Hebei and other provinces can be trained to work in seven or eight days, and are more agile than local horses.

    "Give the best horses to Chinese friends" is the slogan of the herdsmen of the Mongolian People's Republic. Therefore, the Mongolian horses imported in each shipment are neat, strong, and disease-free, and some mares are even pregnant with foals. (Attached picture)

    蒙马
    蒙古人民共和国为了支援我国农业生产，从1951年起开始，八年来共向我国输出马匹十七万八千匹。
    这些马匹大部分供应到河北、山西、河南、山东、江苏、安徽、辽宁、吉林等省。这些原来奔驰在蒙古草原上的马，现在已经为我国农业生产服务了。
    蒙马具有：耐劳、有力、好饲养等特点，很受广大农业社的欢迎。有些人起初担心蒙马性子野，不会干活，其实不像他们想像的那样，山东、河北等省许多农业社饲养的蒙马，训练七、八天就会干活了，并且比当地马还灵巧。
    “把最好的马交给中国朋友”，是蒙古人民共和国牧民们的口号。因此历次进口的蒙马都是整齐、壮实、无病，有些母马并且怀驹。（附图片）
