Regarding the issue of holding a special meeting of the Security Council, the United States, Britain, and France have obvious differences and numerous contradictions, and each has its own plans.

These differences are mainly manifested in the following: De Gaulle believes that it is best to maintain the original plan and hold a meeting of the heads of government of the five countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, India, and France, and that the meeting is best held in Geneva or other European cities. He also expressed his extreme willingness to prepare for the high-level meeting without delay and to participate in the meeting together with the heads of government of various countries. He also stated that if a special meeting of the Security Council is to be held, then in addition to the representatives of the eleven member states of the Council, as well as India and Arab countries, representatives of Turkey, Iran, and Israel should also participate. However, in his reply on July 25, Eisenhower suggested that the issue of convening a special meeting of the Security Council with the participation of heads of government be resubmitted to the regular meeting of the UN Security Council for discussion, changing his position that he had agreed to in his reply on July 23. Although Macmillan expressed his hope to convene a special meeting of the Security Council as soon as possible in his reply, he also expressed his support for Eisenhower's opinion.

On the issue of the agenda of the meeting, although Eisenhower proposed and agreed to Macmillan's proposal to "limit the discussion to the Middle East issue," he also believed that the root causes of these problems should be discussed.

Dulles, who is currently in London to attend the Baghdad Pact Council meeting, is meeting with Macmillan, hoping to mend the rift between Western countries. France, on the other hand, is conducting extensive diplomatic activities in Europe to strengthen France's position at the summit meeting.

According to a United Press International dispatch from London, Dulles and Macmillan and Lloyd held talks for nearly four hours on the 27th. It is said that Dulles and Macmillan were even going to arrange the scope of the special meeting of the Security Council, regardless of De Gaulle's opposition. However, differences still exist between the United States and Britain. Due to strong public opinion pressure, Macmillan is eager to hold the meeting no later than August 11, and is uneasy about the United States' reluctance to hold the meeting. He also hopes to formulate a common Western Middle East policy before the meeting. However, according to news from the United States, the United States is not only cold to the meeting, but also trying to undermine the summit meeting. Well-informed sources in Washington said on the 26th that Eisenhower was prepared to bite back at the meeting and "accuse" the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic of carrying out "subversive and destructive conspiracies" in the Middle East.

On the same day, French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville met with Italian Prime Minister Fanfani in Italy, explaining De Gaulle's request that the highest-level meeting on the Middle East issue be held in Europe rather than in New York, and some proposals for resolving the Middle East issue. Fanfani agreed to convey France's views to Eisenhower during his visit to the United States. On the 29th, Couve de Murville will visit West German Foreign Minister Brentano in Bonn. France is also conducting diplomatic probes with eleven European and North African countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, and Tunisia, through diplomatic channels. According to reports from United Press International and the Paris correspondent of the British "Observer," the activities of France in European and North African countries are all aimed at strengthening France's position at the summit meeting. France considers itself the leader of the third force in Western Europe. Agence France-Presse also said that only France's reply took into account the interests of Western Europe.

According to a Kyodo News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 26th, the United States is currently obviously very worried about the inconsistent steps of the three Western powers.

A Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 27th also analyzed the situation in the United States, pointing out that the United States is treating the highest-level meeting with a deep sense of foreboding. Reuters said: Congress, officials, and most newspapers believed this weekend that the proposed UN Security Council summit meeting was an inescapable nightmare.

There are many reasons for this pessimism. The "New York Times" weekly commentary on the 27th summarized as follows: "The United States seems to be involved in something it has been trying to avoid for more than six months - a summit meeting."

First, officials privately admit that the three Western powers have not yet reached an agreement on a consistent and broad Middle East policy. However, these officials say that such a policy will have to be formulated or temporarily formulated before the summit is held. Diplomats say that the talks between Secretary of State Dulles and the British Foreign Secretary in Washington did not produce such a long-term policy.

The second reason is the inconsistent attitude of the allies towards the summit meeting. Macmillan mentioned in his brief letter to Khrushchev on the 26th that he would discuss "certain Middle East issues" at the Security Council summit meeting.

Some officials here believe that this means that Britain wants to hold a summit meeting limited to discussing the issues of Lebanon and Jordan. This attitude runs counter to Eisenhower's reply to Khrushchev, which firmly believes that the issues of Lebanon and Jordan are only "individual phenomena in a far broader problem" and must be discussed in a broader context.

French Prime Minister De Gaulle said in his letter to Khrushchev that he agreed in principle to participate in the Security Council summit meeting. However, France does not agree with Eisenhower's argument that any summit meeting held in the near future must be based on the rules and procedures of the Security Council. De Gaulle largely prefers to hold a summit meeting outside the scope of the United Nations.

The third reason is that this year is a congressional election year, and many Republicans who follow Eisenhower are worried that holding a summit meeting will cause them to lose some votes in the November elections. Due to the economic recession, the landing of troops in Lebanon, and accusations of government corruption, the Republicans are already in a politically difficult situation.

Washington diplomatic experts believe that the differences between the United States and Britain can probably be adjusted, but it may be extremely difficult to ask France to take the same steps. They are already worried that, as people worried when the De Gaulle cabinet was formed, if France proposes a separate diplomatic route, this will not only create a rift in the cooperation and unity of the three Western powers, but also greatly shake the cause of all member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

### 在准备召开首脑会议问题上  美英法各有打算意见分歧

    在准备召开首脑会议问题上
    美英法各有打算意见分歧
    本报讯　在举行安全理事会特别会议问题上，美、英、法有明显的分歧，矛盾重重，各有打算。
    这些分歧，主要的表现在：戴高乐认为最好保持最初的计划，召开有苏、美、英、印、法五国政府首脑的会议，并且会议最好在日内瓦或其他欧洲城市举行。他还表示极其愿意毫不迟延地来筹备高级会议，并同各国政府首脑一起参加这个会议。他也表示，如果要举行安理会特别会议，那么参加会议的除了十一个理事国以及印度和阿拉伯国家的代表之外，还应该有土耳其、伊朗和以色列三国的代表参加。而艾森豪威尔在7月25日的复信中，却建议重新把召开由政府的首脑参加的安理会别特会议问题，提交联合国安理会常会讨论，改变了他在7月23日复信中已经同意的立场。麦克米伦虽则在复信中希望尽快地召开安理会特别会议，但是也表示了支持艾森豪威尔的意见。
    在会议的议程问题上，艾森豪威尔虽然提出并同意麦克米伦提出的“限于讨论中东问题”，但是还认为应该讨论这些问题的根源。
    现在在伦敦参加巴格达条约理事会的杜勒斯，正同麦克米伦会谈，希望弥补西方国家间的裂痕。而法国，却在欧洲进行广泛的外交活动，来加强法国在首脑会议上的地位。
    据合众国际社伦敦消息，杜勒斯和麦克米伦、劳埃德在27日会谈了近四小时，据说，杜勒斯和麦克米伦竟然要不顾戴高乐的反对，继续为举行安全理事会特别会议的范围进行安排。可是，在美英之间也仍然存在分歧。由于受到强大的舆论压力，麦克米伦急切地希望能不迟于8月11日举行会议，而对于美国不太情愿举行会议感到不安。他并且希望能在会议之前，制定一个西方共同的中东政策。但是，从美国传出的消息说，美国不但对会议表示冷淡，并且设法破坏首脑会议，华盛顿消息灵通人士26日说，艾森豪威尔准备在会上反咬一口，“控告”苏联和阿联在中东实行“颠覆和破坏的阴谋”。
    在同一日，法国外长德姆维尔到意大利会晤了意总理范范尼，说明戴高乐主张在欧洲而不是在纽约召开中东问题最高级会议的要求以及解决中东问题的一些主张。范范尼同意在访美时把法国的意见转告艾森豪威尔。29日德姆维尔要去波恩访问西德外长勃伦塔诺。法国并且正在通过外交途径同欧洲和北非的比利时、荷兰、突尼斯等十一国进行外交试探。据合众国际社和英国“观察家报”驻巴黎记者的报道，都认为法国在欧洲和北非国家中进行活动，都是为的加强法国在首脑会议上的地位。法国自认为是西欧第三种力量的领袖。法新社还说，只有法国的复信考虑到了西欧的利益。
    据共同社华盛顿26日电，目前，美国对于西方三大国步调不一致的情况，显然感到非常忧虑。
    路透社华盛顿27日电也分析了美国这种情况，指出美国是带着深刻的不祥的预感对待最高级会议的。路透社说：国会、官方人士以及大部分报纸都在本周周末认为，拟议中的联合国安全理事会政府首脑会议是一场不可逃避的恶梦。
    产生这种悲观情绪的原因很多，27日的“纽约时报”每周评论总结如下：“美国似乎被卷入了它六个多月来竭力想逃避的事情——最高级会议。”
    首先，官员们私下承认西方三大国尚未就一致的、广泛的中东政策达成协议。然而，这些官员说，这种政策将必须在举行最高级会议以前拟定或者临时拟定。外交界人士说，国务卿杜勒斯和英国外交大臣在华盛顿举行的会谈并未得出这种长期的政策。
    第二个原因是，盟国间对最高级会议的态度不一致，麦克米伦在26日给赫鲁晓夫的简短信件中谈到要在安全理事会最高级会议上讨论“某些中东问题”。
    这里的一些官员认为，这意味着英国想举行一个限于讨论黎巴嫩和约旦问题的最高级会议。这种态度跟艾森豪威尔给赫鲁晓夫的复信背道而驰，艾森豪威尔的复信坚决认为，黎巴嫩和约旦问题只是“远为广泛的问题中的个别现象”，必须在更广泛的范围内加以讨论。
    法国总理戴高乐在给赫鲁晓夫的信件中说，他原则上同意参加安全理事会最高级会议。但是，法国不同意艾森豪威尔主张任何早日举行的最高级会议必须根据安全理事会的规章和程序的论点。戴高乐在很大程度上宁愿在联合国范围外举行最高级会议。
    第三个原因是，今年是国会选举年，许多追随艾森豪威尔的共和党人担心首脑会议的召开，会使他们在11月间的选举中失掉一些选票。由于经济衰退、军队在黎巴嫩登陆以及关于政府腐化的指责，共和党人已经在政治上处于困境。
    华盛顿外交专家们认为，对美、英两国的意见分歧，大概总能够设法加以调整，但是要求法国采取同样步调，恐怕是极为困难的。他们已经感到忧虑，他们认为，就像戴高乐内阁成立当初人们所耽忧的那样，如果法国提出单独的外交路线，这就不仅会使西方三大国的合作和团结发生裂痕，而且也将成为大大地动摇北大西洋公约组织全体成员国家的原因。
