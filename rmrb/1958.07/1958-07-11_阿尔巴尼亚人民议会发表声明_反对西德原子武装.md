    阿尔巴尼亚人民议会发表声明
    反对西德原子武装
    新华社地拉那10日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团、人民议会主席和人民议会外交委员会在9日举行了联席会议以后发表一项声明，抗议西德联邦议院通过关于用原子武器和火箭武器武装西德军队的决议。
    声明指出，直接受到德国军国主义灾难的阿尔巴尼亚人民，对用毁灭性的武器来武装希特勒军官手中的军队一事不能够漠不关心。全体阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民议会代表都支持阿尔巴尼亚政府反对西德原子武装的政策和态度。声明接着又说，阿尔巴尼亚人民对于它的邻国的某些集团在他们的领土上建立原子和火箭基地方面所作的努力也不能漠不关心。阿尔巴尼亚政府已经严正地对意大利政府声明，如果意大利领土上设置火箭发射装置的话，那么，阿尔巴尼亚政府将被迫来采取保卫它的独立和主权的措施，即在阿尔巴尼亚领土上也将会有火箭发射装置。
