    To Participate in the Socialist Construction of the Motherland
    Three Groups of Hong Kong Technical Workers Have Returned to Guangzhou
    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 7th. On the 6th, another 130-plus technical workers from Hong Kong returned to Guangzhou collectively to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. This is already the third group in the last ten days. Including the previous two groups, there are a total of 280 people.
  The technical workers who returned to Guangzhou on the 6th include more than ten trades such as lathe, textile, and casting. When they left Hong Kong by train, they expressed to those who saw them off that they were determined to contribute all their strength to building the socialist motherland and strive to make contributions in the construction.
    In recent days, many labor unions in Hong Kong have held gatherings to congratulate the workers who returned to Guangzhou to participate in the construction. The Hong Kong press and publishing circles also held a farewell banquet on the 3rd.
