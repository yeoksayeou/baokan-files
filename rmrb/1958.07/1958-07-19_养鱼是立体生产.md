    Agricultural production is limited to the surface of the land, but fish farming is not limited to the surface of the water. Instead, several types of fish can be mixed and raised at the same time, according to their different habitats and feeding habits. Silver carp and bighead carp live in the upper layers of the water, grass carp and bream in the middle layers, and black carp, carp, and mud carp live in the lower layers. Isn't the simultaneous raising of these fish in lakes and ponds three-dimensional production!

    养鱼是立体生产
    农业生产仅限于土地表面，养鱼就不是只限于水的表层，而可以根据不同鱼类栖息层和食性，同时混合放养几种鱼。淡水鱼中的鲢、鳙栖息在水的较上层，草鱼、鳊鱼在水的中层，青鱼、鲤鱼、鲮鱼等生活在水的下层。湖泊池塘里同时放养这些鱼，不就成立体生产了吗！
