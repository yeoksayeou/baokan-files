Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch from Santiago: The supplement "Orientation" of the Chilean Communist Party's organ "Siglo" published on June 6th a report by Elias Lafertte, Chairman of the Chilean Communist Party, to the 28th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chilean Communist Party regarding the convocation of the 11th Congress of the Chilean Communist Party. The report criticized the revisionist stance of the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

Lafertte said in his report: Imperialism is influencing certain sections of the working class, drawing them away from the world socialist and communist movement. This is the main source of revisionism. From this arose Bernstein's revisionism, which at the end of the 19th century denied the inevitable collapse of capitalism, arguing that there would no longer be any pauperization of the proletariat, and advised the working class to confine itself to economic struggles and abandon revolutionary goals. From this also arose the revisionism of Kautsky and Hilferding, who glorified the monopoly organizations of imperialism, claiming that they were evolving towards socialism, while opposing the newly born Soviet Union. They advocated class peace, thereby helping imperialism to suppress the workers' movement. From this also arose the revisionism of the Yugoslav leaders, who attacked the unity of the communist movement and the socialist camp, concealed the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, and attempted to portray imperialist countries as neutrals in the class struggle.

Lafertte said: We Chilean communists have been educated in the spirit of Recabarren's (Editor's note: Recabarren was one of the founders of the Chilean Communist Party) proletarian internationalism. All facts prove to us that the claims of revisionism are unscientific and contrary to reality. Since we have all tasted the repression launched in 1947 while declaring that the Third World War would be fought on a certain date, how can we be told that U.S. imperialism has not been a factor of aggression and war in world diplomacy in recent years? When the proletariat of Chuquicamata, Potrerillos, and Sewell (Editor's note: all place names in Chile) and the entire national economy have tasted the plunder of monopoly organizations and the flavor of its policies, how can we believe the fallacies of the so-called evolution of monopoly organizations toward socialism? When we see the consequences of the disgraceful compromise between the right-wing Socialist Party leaders and the colonialist military forces in France, and the great effort that the French proletariat must therefore make to block the fascist path (and this is only one of many similar examples), how can we doubt the class nature of imperialist countries? It is precisely because of this that we have recognized the deceptiveness of the various revisionist teachings in the program adopted by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia at its recent Seventh Congress, teachings which have been unanimously praised and vigorously promoted by bourgeois propaganda throughout the world.

    智共主席向智共中央作报告时指出
    必须揭穿南共纲领的骗人鬼话
    它的修正主义说教企图掩盖美帝国主义的侵略性质
    新华社4日讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利共产党机关报“世纪报”副刊“方针”6月6日刊载了智利共产党主席埃利阿斯·拉斐尔特向智利共产党中央二十八次全体会议所作关于召开智利共产党第十一次代表大会的报告。这个报告批判了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人的修正主义立场。
    拉斐尔特在报告中说：帝国主义正在影响工人阶级的某些部分，使他们离开世界社会主义和共产主义运动。这就是修正主义的主要根源。从这里产生了伯恩斯坦的修正主义，他在十九世纪末叶否认资本主义的必然崩溃，认为已不会再有什么无产阶级的贫困化，同时劝告工人阶级把自己局限于进行经济斗争而放弃革命的目标。从这里也产生了考茨基和希弗亭的修正主义，他们美化帝国主义的垄断组织，说什么垄断组织正在向社会主义进化，同时又反对刚刚诞生的苏联。他们主张阶级和平，从而帮助帝国主义镇压工人运动。从这里也产生了南斯拉夫领导人的修正主义，他们抨击共产主义运动和社会主义阵营的团结，掩盖美帝国主义的侵略性质，并企图把帝国主义国家描写为阶级斗争中的中立者。
    拉斐尔特说：我们智利共产党人受过雷卡巴伦（编者按：雷卡巴伦是智利共产党创始人之一）无产阶级国际主义精神的教育。一切事实都向我们证明，修正主义的主张是反科学的，是同现实背道而驰的。既然我们大家都尝到过1947年在宣称某一日期就要打第三次世界大战的同时所发动的镇压，那末怎么能够向我们说美帝国主义不是近年来世界外交上侵略和战争的因素呢？当丘基卡马达、波特雷里约斯和塞韦耳（编者按：都是智利的地名）等地的无产阶级和整个国民经济都饱尝了垄断组织的掠夺行为和它的政策的味道的时候，我们怎么能够相信所谓垄断组织向社会主义进化的鬼话呢？当我们看到法国右翼社会党领袖们和殖民主义军事势力进行不光彩的妥协的后果以及法国无产阶级因此要用多大气力去堵塞法西斯道路（而这只是许多类似的实例之一）的时候，我们怎么能怀疑帝国主义国家的阶级性呢？正是因为这样，所以我们认识到了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟在它的最近的第七次代表大会上所通过的纲领中的各种修正主义说教的欺骗性，这些修正主义的说教得到全世界资产阶级宣传的同声赞扬和大力鼓吹。
