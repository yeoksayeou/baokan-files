Remarkable News about Early Rice

    "Early Rice King"
    In an experimental plot of land at the New Star Cooperative in Guihu Township, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, a particularly large rice ear appeared. The ear was nine inches long, about three inches longer than ordinary rice ears. It yielded 514 grains, three to four times more than ordinary rice ears, which yield about 100 grains. The rice stalk was very thick. This experimental plot adopted direct seeding with dense planting, and more fertilizer was applied than in other fields. Generally, each ear yielded about 300 grains.
    
    "Double-Eared Rice"
    In Tanxi Township, Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, many instances of "double-eared rice" have appeared in two plots of land. One nine-tenth acre plot is an experimental field managed by township cadres; the other four-tenth acre plot is an experimental field managed by township women cadres. Both plots used densely planted "awned early japonica" seeds, and field management was well executed.
    
    The Hengling Agricultural Cooperative in Yuqian County, Zhejiang Province, at the foot of Tianmu Mountain, also discovered double-eared rice in five mu of land. In the experimental field cultivated by the Tenth Team of the Jinwu Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaoshan County, on the edge of the Qiantang River, each rice clump had two to three double-eared rice heads.
    
    "Triple-Eared Rice"
    In a field of "awned early japonica" at the Yongning Agricultural Cooperative in Bao'an Township, Zhuji County, a rice plant was discovered with three rice ears, each ear bearing 170 grains. The rice ears in this field are robust and laden with grains, promising a bumper harvest. The cooperative members sing, "Double-eared rice was rare in ancient times, Socialist production is high, Today one rice plant draws three ears, A treasure among miracles." (Xinhua News Agency)

    早稻珍闻
    “早稻王”
    福建晋江县龟湖乡新星社一丘试验田里出现一株特大的稻穗，穗长达九寸，比一般稻穗长三寸左右，结谷五百一十四粒，比一般稻穗结谷一百粒左右多三倍到四倍，稻秆十分粗壮。这丘试验田是采取的直播密植，施肥也比别的田多。一般每穗结谷都在三百粒左右。
    “双穗稻”
    浙江诸暨县檀溪乡有两丘田出现不少“双穗稻”。一丘有九分是乡干部的试验田；另一丘有四分是乡妇女干部的试验田。这两丘田都是用的“有芒早粳”种子密植，田间管理搞得好。
    天目山下的浙江于潜县横岭农业社也在五亩田里发现了双穗稻。在钱塘江边的萧山县金坞农业社第十小队种的试验田里，每一丛稻禾中都有两根到三根双穗稻头。
    “三穗稻”
    诸暨县保安乡永宁农业社在一丘“有芒早粳”的田里，发现一株抽三个稻穗的稻子，每个稻穗有一百七十粒谷子。这丘田稻穗健壮，结谷累累，大丰收在望。社员有歌道：“稻出双穗自古少，社会主义产量高，今朝一稻抽三穗，奇迹之中又一宝”。　（新华社）
