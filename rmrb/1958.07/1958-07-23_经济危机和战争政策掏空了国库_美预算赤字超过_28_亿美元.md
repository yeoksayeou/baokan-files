Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 22nd: The US Treasury Department and the Bureau of the Budget jointly announced on the 21st that in the 1958 fiscal year ending June 30th, the US government's budget deficit increased to $2,813 million, while at the beginning of this year, Eisenhower estimated the deficit for this year to be only $400 million.

The Treasury Department and the Bureau of the Budget pointed out that the large budget deficit in this fiscal year was due to the development of the economic crisis, which reduced the US government's fiscal revenue, while the increase in military spending increased total expenditures. The total revenue of the US government in this fiscal year was $69.1 billion, a decrease of nearly $2 billion compared to the 1957 fiscal year. The total expenditure was $71.9 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion compared to the 1957 fiscal year. According to US officials, the US government's budget deficit in the 1959 fiscal year, which began on July 1st, will increase to $10 billion to $12 billion.

    经济危机和战争政策掏空了国库
    美预算赤字超过28亿美元
    新华社22日讯  华盛顿消息：美国财政部和预算局21日联合宣布，在今年6月30日结束的1958财政年度内，美国政府的预算赤字增加到二十八亿一千三百万美元，而今年年初艾森豪威尔估计这一年度的赤字只有四亿美元。
    财政部和预算局指出，这一财政年度的预算赤字所以庞大，是因为经济危机的发展使美国政府的财政收入减少，而军事开支的增加又使总开支有所增加。总计这一财政年度美国政府的总收入是六百九十一亿美元，比1957财政年度的总收入减少了近二十亿美元。总开支的数目是七百一十九亿美元，比1957财政年度增加了二十五亿美元。据美国官员估计，在从7月1日开始的1959财政年度中美国政府的预算赤字将要增加到一百亿至一百二十亿美元。
