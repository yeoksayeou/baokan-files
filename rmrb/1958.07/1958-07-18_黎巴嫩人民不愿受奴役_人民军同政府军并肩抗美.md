    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 18th July - According to a broadcast by the Free Lebanon Radio, Lebanese Army Commander-in-Chief Shehab announced on the 16th: "The entire Lebanese Army has decided to resist American interference in Lebanon. If the American troops do not withdraw from Lebanon within a limited time, the Lebanese Army will join the People's Forces."
    The radio station also said that Shehab contacted the Commander-in-Chief of the Beirut People's Army, Salam, on the 16th, and informed him that if foreign troops do not withdraw from Lebanon soon, the Lebanese Army will be under the command of the people. The radio station said that the Lebanese Army has withdrawn from the entire city of Beirut and is concentrated in the Khoursh area on the outskirts of Beirut and on the road leading to Beirut Airport.
    All newspapers in Damascus on the 17th published news from Beirut saying that the American aggressor troops occupied the Pan American Building in the center of Beirut on the 16th and first fired at the positions of the Basta district, which was defended by the Lebanese People's Army. The People's Army fought back against the imperialist invaders, killing nine American aggressor troops and wounding many others. Part of the Lebanese Army fought side-by-side with the People's Army. Many explosions occurred in many parts of Beirut, especially near Parliament Square and the Parliament Building, where the American aggressor troops were advancing. The People's Army forced the American aggressor troops to retreat and forced them to withdraw from the Pan American Building and Parliament Square.
    Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency report: According to the "Star Daily," Lebanese opposition leader and former Prime Minister Salam said on the 15th in a statement on the landing of American aggressor troops in Lebanon, "This action blatantly violates the norms of international conduct. We will do everything in our power to resist it."
    In a statement to the People's Resistance Army on the 15th, Salam called on them: "To die for your freedom and dignity is far better than living under the spears of foreign colonialists."
    Salam denied the Reuters report about ordering the People's Army to stop fighting in an interview with a Damascus radio reporter. Salam said: "The Lebanese people are determined to fight to the end and to eliminate imperialism and aggressors from the country."
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 16th - Radio stations here broadcast on the evening of the 16th that opposition leaders Ahmed al-Assad, Sabri Hamadeh, Shafiq Mourtada, and Renate Moawad telegraphed the President of the United Nations Security Council and representatives of the member states on the 16th to protest against the American military aggression against Lebanon. Speaker of Parliament Oseiran also telegraphed U.S. President Eisenhower, the UN Secretary-General, the President of the UN Security Council, the Speaker of the U.S. Congress, and Secretary of State Dulles, condemning the American aggression against Lebanon. Oseiran's telegram said: "I am very sorry about the landing of American troops in Lebanon under the pretext of protecting American expatriates in Lebanon and saving Lebanon's independence and sovereignty." The telegram said: In the past sixty-five days since the uprising broke out, the lives and interests of Americans have never been threatened. The telegram said: "I believe that the landing of American troops in Lebanon is a threat to peace in the Middle East, and the United States bears full responsibility for any adverse consequences that may occur."
    The radio reported that people close to the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon are trying to get out of the predicament of worldwide opposition to the landing of American troops by electing a new president. However, their attempt was opposed by all opposition leaders and neutral parliamentarians.
    It is reported that some members of the Lebanese parliament are striving to convene an emergency meeting of parliament to discuss the issue of the US military landing in Lebanon. These parliamentarians are now collecting signatures on a proposal to convene an emergency meeting. According to the constitution, thirty-four members of the sixty-six-member parliament are required to sign in order to convene an emergency meeting. Twenty-nine members have now signed.

    黎巴嫩人民不愿受奴役
    人民军同政府军并肩抗美
    据新华社大马士革电　据自由黎巴嫩之声电台广播，黎巴嫩陆军总司令谢哈布16日宣布：“黎巴嫩全体陆军决定抵抗美国对黎巴嫩的干涉。如果美国军队不在有限的时间内撤出黎巴嫩的话，黎巴嫩陆军将参加人民部队。”
    这家电台又说，谢哈布在16日同贝鲁特人民军总司令萨拉姆进行了接触，并且通知他说，如果外国军队不很快撤出黎巴嫩，黎巴嫩陆军将归人民来指挥。这家电台说，黎巴嫩陆军已经从贝鲁特全市撤退，集中在贝鲁特外围的胡尔什地区和通往贝鲁特机场的公路上。
    17日大马士革所有的报纸都刊登来自贝鲁特的消息说，美国侵略军在16日侵占贝鲁特市中心的泛美大厦，并且首先向黎巴嫩人民军固守的巴斯塔区阵地方面射击。人民军向帝国主义入侵者回击，打死了九名美国侵略军，还打伤了他们许多。一部分黎巴嫩陆军同人民军并肩作战。贝鲁特许多地方，特别是美国侵略军推进中的议会广场和议会大厦附近，发生了许多爆炸。人民军迫使了美国侵略军后退，强使他们从泛美大厦和议会广场撤出。
    综合新华社消息　据“明星日报”报道，黎巴嫩反对党领袖、前总理萨拉姆15日在就美国侵略军在黎巴嫩登陆发表谈话时说，“这个行动悍然违反了国际行为准则。我们将尽一切力量予以抵抗”。
    萨拉姆15日向人民抵抗军人员发表声明，号召他们：“为了你们的自由和尊严而死，是比在外国殖民主义者的矛头下生活好得多”。
    萨拉姆对大马士革电台记者发表了否认路透社关于下令人民军停止战斗的消息的谈话。萨拉姆说：“黎巴嫩人民坚决斗争到底，并且要把国内的帝国主义和侵略者清除干净。”
    据新华社大马士革16日电　这里的电台16日晚上广播，反对党派领袖艾哈迈德·阿萨德、萨布里·哈马德、沙菲克·穆尔塔达和雷奈特·毛瓦德在16日分别打电报给联合国安全理事会主席和理事国代表，抗议美国对黎巴嫩的军事侵略。议会议长奥塞兰也打电报给美国总统艾森豪威尔、联合国秘书长、联合国安全理事会主席、美国国会议长和国务卿杜勒斯，谴责美国对黎巴嫩的侵略。奥塞兰的电报说：“我对于美国军队在保护黎巴嫩美国侨民和拯救黎巴嫩独立和主权的借口下在黎巴嫩登陆一事感到非常遗憾。”电报说：自从起义爆发以来的过去六十五天中，美国人的生命和利益从来没有受到威胁。电报说：“我认为，美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆是对中东和平的威胁，美国对于可能发生的一切不良后果要负完全责任。”
    电台报道说，接近美国驻黎巴嫩大使馆的人士试图用选举新总统的办法来摆脱全世界反对美国军队登陆而陷入的困境。但是，他们的企图遭到了所有反对派领袖和中立派议员的反对。
    据报道，黎巴嫩的一些议员正在争取召开议会紧急会议来讨论关于美军在黎巴嫩登陆的问题。现在这些议员正在征集在要求召开紧急会议的建议书上签名。根据宪法，在六十六名议员的议会中，需要有三十四个议员签名，才能召开紧急会议。现在已经有二十九个议员签了名。
