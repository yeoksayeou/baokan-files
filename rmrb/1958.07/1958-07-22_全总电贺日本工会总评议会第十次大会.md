Xinhua News Agency Report: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) sent a telegram on the 20th to the 10th Congress of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), congratulating them on the convening of the congress.

The telegram stated that, over the past few years, trade unions of China and Japan have made active efforts and significant contributions to promoting the development of friendly relations between the two peoples and the normalization of relations between the two countries. The broad masses of Japanese workers and people have clearly seen that the Chinese people have always been friendly to the Japanese people. We would like to express our respect to your council and to Japanese friends who are sincerely friendly to China.

However, the Kishi Nobusuke government, in violation of the wishes of the Japanese workers and people, is plotting to revive militarism, continuing to follow the United States, continuing to create "two Chinas," persisting in being hostile to the 600 million Chinese people, and wantonly undermining the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. This policy of the Kishi government only serves the aggressive policies of the United States and the latent imperialistic ambitions of Japanese monopoly capitalist groups. This is not only dragging Japan into the abyss of disaster once again, but also poses a serious threat to Asian peace and many Asian countries.

Japanese workers and the broad masses of people are waging a tenacious struggle against this policy of the Kishi government. Recently, the Kishi government has been increasingly intensifying its fascist suppression and persecution of Japanese workers and people, depriving workers and people of their democratic rights, and disciplining and arresting large numbers of trade union cadres and workers. This can only arouse stronger anger and resistance from Japanese workers and people, and make them more determined to fight for peace, freedom, and independence. The Chinese workers and people express their fraternal respect for your just struggle and, as in the past, will unswervingly support you. We firmly believe that final victory belongs to the Japanese working class and people.

We wish the congress success.

    全总电贺日本工会总评议会第十次大会
    据新华社讯  中华全国总工会20日打电报给日本工会总评议会第十次大会，对大会的召开表示祝贺。
    电报说，几年来，中日两国工会为促进两国人民友好关系的发展和中日两国关系的正常化，进行了积极的努力，并作出了巨大的贡献。日本广大工人和人民已经清楚地看到，中国人民对日本人民是始终友好的。我们谨向贵会及对中国真诚友好的日本朋友们表示敬意。
    但是，岸信介政府违背日本工人和人民的愿望，阴谋复活军国主义，继续追随美国，继续制造“两个中国”，坚持与中国六亿人民为敌，肆意破坏中日人民的友好关系。岸政府这种政策只是为美国的侵略政策和日本垄断资本集团潜在的帝国主义野心服务的。这不仅正在把日本再一次拖向灾难的深渊，而且也是对亚洲和平及亚洲许多国家的严重威胁。
    日本工人和广大人民为反对岸政府这种政策进行着顽强的斗争。近来，岸政府日益加紧对日本工人和人民进行法西斯镇压、迫害，剥夺工人和人民的民主权利，处分和逮捕大批工会干部和工人，这只能激起日本工人和人民更强烈的愤怒和反抗，愈益坚决地为和平、自由与独立而斗争。中国工人和人民对于你们的正义斗争谨表示兄弟般的敬意，并像过去一样始终不渝地给予支持。我们深信，最后胜利是属于日本工人阶级和人民的。
    祝大会成功。
