    A Soviet Worker Who Dares to Think and Act
    By Our Correspondent Dai Feng

    Some time ago, a Soviet friend introduced me to Vasily Kuznetsov, a worker at the Moscow Hard Alloy Steel Plant. He is an outstanding inventor of new technologies and has long been famous.

    Kuznetsov very enthusiastically invited me to visit their factory. One morning, we arrived at this huge alloy steel plant, where Kuznetsov was already waiting for us at the entrance. He was wearing a black coarse cloth work uniform, with a ruddy complexion, and sparse gray-white short hair interspersed with black curls. His strong, powerful hands were covered in black oil.

    We talked in an office in Kuznetsov's workshop. I had heard that Kuznetsov had been working hard on inventions since he entered the factory as an apprentice at the age of fourteen, and he had never stopped for more than thirty years. Our conversation started from here.

    Kuznetsov was born into a poor peasant family and did not attend school. In 1925, when Kuznetsov had just turned fourteen, his family moved to Moscow in search of a livelihood.

    Upon arriving in Moscow, Kuznetsov was sent to the "Freedom" Soap Factory to work as an apprentice. At that time, simple soap production, including loading, pressing, and cutting, was all done manually. Kuznetsov and everyone else spent their days laboriously bending over to work. The labor was heavy, and the efficiency was low. At this time, Kuznetsov thought to himself: "How wonderful it would be to invent a soap-cutting machine to replace manual labor!"

    One day, Kuznetsov went to his master, Andrei Yev, with this idea, full of excitement. Andrei Yev agreed with him and asked him to draw up the design drawings first.

    From that day on, Kuznetsov went straight home after work and locked himself in his room to design the soap-cutting machine. He didn't know how many sleepless nights he spent, or how many drawings he made, but because he didn't understand calculations, the parts just wouldn't fit together. The sketch of the soap-cutting machine was never completed.

    "This was the first beneficial lesson in my life of invention," Kuznetsov recalled, "This lesson made me truly and sadly realize that the problem lay in a lack of basic knowledge."

    So Kuznetsov entered a workers' night school, working during the day and studying at night. He devoted almost all of his spare time to studying, especially mathematics and physics. By 1927, he had reached the level of a sixth-grade elementary school student. Soon after, Kuznetsov transferred to the Moscow Hard Alloy Steel Plant to work.

    Before the October Revolution, Tsarist Russia did not produce alloy steel at all. In the early days of the Soviet regime, the government used gold to invite foreign experts to help produce alloy steel. At that time, the production of alloy steel was just beginning in various countries. The production process was complex, and the calculation requirements for the combination of various metal raw materials were very precise. Therefore, it was generally believed that it could only be made by skillful manual labor.

    On Kuznetsov's first day of work at the Hard Alloy Steel Plant, Olga Volkova, a mold-pressing worker and the Party Branch Secretary of the workshop, led him to visit the various production units. After they looked at the smelting furnace workshop, they came to the main department of alloy production—the mold-pressing workshop. Here, many men and women workers were gathered around a workbench and a hand-cranked mold-pressing machine. The female workers first mixed various metal raw materials together and put them on a scale to weigh them. Then, the workers put the weighed raw materials on the mold and pressed them hard. The whole workshop seemed to be covered in a misty rain, and every worker's hair, eyelashes, and face were covered with a layer of metal powder.

    Volkova said to Kuznetsov, the new worker: "These working conditions in our workshop cannot continue like this for long. The output is low, there are many defective products, and the workers are exhausted."

    Kuznetsov strongly agreed with Volkova's idea. From that time on, he began to design the first automated mold-pressing machine. Kuznetsov's bold idea and practice spread. At that time, automated machines were still just an ideal. Therefore, many people thought this matter was not worth mentioning and was merely a young man's fantasy. Kuznetsov ignored these comments and continued to immerse himself in research, frequently visiting the library and consulting with veteran workers. A year and a half later, Kuznetsov designed the first automatic mold-pressing machine. However, this design was imperfect and could not be made into a machine.

    Next, Kuznetsov used another two years of his spare time to design a second, more complete mold-pressing machine based on the design of the first automatic machine. This design was theoretically and practically feasible in terms of mechanics. Therefore, the Party helped him officially trial-produce the first automatic mold-pressing machine.

    The day for testing the mold-pressing machine finally arrived. This day became a joyous event for the factory. However, the machine only produced two or three products before the central lever broke due to excessive pressure. The second design was also unsuccessful.

    At this time, Kuznetsov repeatedly thought: "Am I really being clever? Can an ordinary worker really not design such a complex machine? I don't believe it. But where exactly is the mistake?"

    That evening, Party Branch Secretary Volkova asked someone to send Kuznetsov a package of books on design, and said that it was for him to design the third mold-pressing machine. This greatly encouraged Kuznetsov. He immediately began to seriously study the reasons for the failure and began designing the third mold-pressing machine. In this way, after another year and a half, the first real, very complex, but very clever automatic mold-pressing machine was manufactured. The production efficiency of mold-pressing increased dozens of times at once. The workers loved this automated machine and called it "the smart guy." Kuznetsov's daring and courageous creative deeds quickly spread throughout the city, promoting the mass invention and technological innovation movement at that time.

    Now, the mold-pressing workshop has a whole row of "smart guys" working, and these "smart guys" are twelve different types. Some machines only need one female worker to look after them, while others are completely automatic. These machines are all the victorious products of Kuznetsov's continued efforts without complacency.

    After Kuznetsov made the first mold-pressing machine, he improved the high-temperature smelting electric furnace, which foreign experts at the time thought could not be improved, liberating the previous heavy physical labor. However, the deeper Kuznetsov delved into research, the more deeply he realized that one person's strength was too weak. Therefore, at a workshop Party branch meeting, Kuznetsov proposed that, in order to speed up the pace of technological reform, it would be best to establish a worker's technological reform group to use collective strength to realize a mass invention and creation movement. This initiative was supported by the Party, and a mass technological reform movement was launched throughout the factory. This movement achieved great success.

    Kuznetsov's technological invention and creation group has a total of four people. They study together three times a week, using their spare time. In the eight years since the group was established, they have helped and learned from each other and have invented more than a dozen valuable automatic machines. One of them even won the Stalin Prize. The technological reforms of the Kuznetsov group have saved the country more than 20 million rubles. Now, they are studying the creation of a machine for an automated production line.

             　 *　　　*　　　*

    Kuznetsov said when we said goodbye: "I know that your country is currently also carrying out a technological revolution. This is completely correct. We are taking the same path. From my own personal experience, I deeply feel that a worker, especially a young worker, should seriously consider the impact of workers' creativity and technological innovation on the speed of national construction. The working people are all-powerful. They should dare to think boldly and, more importantly, dare to act boldly. As long as their will is firm, then there will definitely be results. I wish the fraternal Chinese workers even greater victories in the technological revolution." (Attached picture)

### 一个敢想敢做的苏联工人

    一个敢想敢做的苏联工人
    本报记者　戴枫
    前些天，苏联朋友介绍我认识了莫斯科硬质合金钢厂工人华西里·库兹尼佐夫。他是一位出色的新技术发明创造者，早已闻名。
    库兹尼佐夫非常热情地邀我到他们的工厂去看看。一天早晨，我们来到这个规模巨大的合金钢厂，库兹尼佐夫早已在门口等候我们了。他身穿一套黑色粗布的工作服，脸色红润，灰白色的短发里夹杂着稀疏的黑发卷。一双结实有力的手上粘满了乌黑的机油。
    我们在库兹尼佐夫车间里的一间办公室里谈了起来。我早就听说过，库兹尼佐夫从十四岁进工厂当学徒时起，就努力于发明创造，而且三十多年来如一日，从没有间断过。我们的谈话就从这里开始。
    库兹尼佐夫生在一个贫农的家庭里，没有进过学校。1925年，当库兹尼佐夫刚满十四岁时，父亲为谋生起见，全家迁居莫斯科。
    到了莫斯科，库兹尼佐夫被送进“自由”肥皂厂，当了学徒。那时候，简单的肥皂生产，装料、压制、切块都是用手工操作。库兹尼佐夫和大家一起整天吃力地弯着腰工作。劳动沉重，效率也低。这时，库兹尼佐夫心里想：“要是发明一部切皂机器来代替手工劳动该多么好啊！”
    一天，库兹尼佐夫带着这个想法兴冲冲地去找师傅安德烈也夫。安德烈也夫赞成他的意见，让他先把设计图画出来。
    从这一天起，库兹尼佐夫一下工就直奔回家，关起房门设计切皂机。不知道度过了多少个不眠之夜，不知道画了多少张图纸，但是由于不懂计算，零件与零件怎么也合不上拍。切皂机的草图最后还是没有画出来。
    “这是我的发明创造生活中有益的第一课。”库兹尼佐夫回忆说：“这一课使我真正伤心地感到，问题在于缺乏基本知识。”
    库兹尼佐夫于是进了工人夜校，白天做工，晚上读书。他几乎把所有的工余时间都用来学习，特别是数学和物理。到1927年，他已达到小学六年级的程度了。此后不久，库兹尼佐夫转入了莫斯科硬质合金钢厂做工。
    十月革命前，沙皇俄国根本不生产合金钢。苏维埃政权初期，政府用黄金请来外国专家帮助生产合金钢。当时，合金钢的生产在各国都是刚刚开始，生产过程繁杂，各项金属原料配合计算要求十分精确。因此，一般认为非用灵巧的手工制作不可。
    库兹尼佐夫到硬质合金钢厂工作的第一天，压模女工、车间党支书奥利加·伏尔科娃领他参观了各生产单位。他们看了冶炼炉车间以后，来到合金生产的主要部门——压模车间。这里许多男女工人围着一个工作台和一部手摇压模机。女工先把各种金属原料配合在一起，放到天平上去秤。然后，工人们把秤好的原料放在压模上用力压。整个车间里好像落着蒙蒙雨似的，每个工人的头发、睫毛、脸上都落有一层金属粉末。
    伏尔科娃对这位新来的工人库兹尼佐夫说：“我们车间的这种工作条件，不能长此下去。产量少，废品多，工人也累得吃不消。”
    库兹尼佐夫非常赞成伏尔科娃的想法。从那时起，他就着手设计第一部自动化的压模机了。库兹尼佐夫的这个大胆想法和做法传出去了。在当时，自动化机器还仅仅是理想。所以许多人认为这件事不值一提，仅仅是青年人的痴想而已。库兹尼佐夫没有理睬这些，他继续埋头钻研，经常出入图书馆，请教老工人。一年半以后，库兹尼佐夫设计出了第一部自动压模机。不过这个设计不完善，还不能制成机器。
    接着，库兹尼佐夫又利用了两年的工余时间，在第一部自动机器设计的基础上，设计出了第二部较完善的压模机。这个设计在机械学理论上和实践上都是能成立的，于是党帮助他正式试制了第一部自动压模机。
    试验压模机的一天终于来到了。这天成了工厂的一件大喜事。但是机器只压出了两、三个产品，中枢杠杆就由于吃不住过大压力而折断了。第二个设计又没有成功。
    这时，库兹尼佐夫反复地想：“难道我真是自作聪明吗？一个普通工人真的不能设计出这种复杂的机器吗？我不相信。不过，错误究竟在哪里呢？”
    当天晚上，党支部书记伏尔科娃托人给库兹尼佐夫送来一包关于设计的书，并且说，这是为他设计第三个压模机用的。这大大鼓舞了库兹尼佐夫。他立刻就开始认真研究失败的原因，开始了第三个压模机的设计。就这样，又经过了一年半，第一架真正的、非常复杂但又十分灵巧的自动压模机制造出来了。压模的生产效率一下提高了数十倍。工人们热爱这架自动化机器，把它叫作“聪明人”。库兹尼佐夫敢想敢做的大胆创造事迹，很快在全城传了开来，推动了当时的群众性的发明创造和技术革新运动。
    如今压模车间已经有整排的“聪明人”在工作，而且这些“聪明人”是十二种不同类型的，有的机器只需一个女工看管，有的完全是自动的。这些机器都是库兹尼佐夫不自满、继续努力的胜利产物。
    库兹尼佐夫在制成第一部压模机后，又改进了当时外国专家认为无法改进的高温冶炼电炉，把以前的沉重体力劳动解放了出来。但是，当库兹尼佐夫越深入钻研，他也就越深刻地体会到，一个人的力量太单薄。所以在一次车间党支部大会上，库兹尼佐夫提议，为了加快技术改革的速度，最好成立工人技术改革小组，运用集体力量，实现群众性的发明创造运动。这个倡议得到了党的支持，于是全厂开展了群众性的技术改革运动。这个运动获得了巨大成绩。
    库兹尼佐夫技术发明创造小组一共四个人，他们每星期利用工余时间一起研究三次。成立小组的八年来，他们互相帮助，互相学习，已发明了十来部有价值的自动机器了。其中有一项还荣获了斯大林奖金。库兹尼佐夫小组的技术改革已为国家节省了两千多万卢布。现在，他们正在研究创造一部自动化作业线的机器。
             　 *　　　*　　　* 　
    库兹尼佐夫在我们告辞时说：“我知道，你们国家目前也正进行着技术革命，这完全正确，我们走的是同样的路。从我的亲身经验里，我深深感到，一个工人，尤其是青年工人，应该认真考虑到工人的创造性和技术革新对于国家建设速度的影响。劳动者是万能的，应该大胆地想，更要大胆地做，只要意志坚定，那末一定会有成果。我预祝兄弟中国工人在技术革命方面取得更大的胜利。”（附图片）
