Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 16th—According to the Middle East News Agency tonight, President Nasser of the United Arab Republic issued a statement on the 16th, condemning the United States' armed intervention in Lebanon, and pointed out that any aggression against the Republic of Iraq will be regarded as an act of aggression against the United Arab Republic at the same time, and the United Arab Republic will, in accordance with the Arab Joint Defense Treaty, fulfill its obligations to the Republic of Iraq.
    President Nasser's statement reads in full: "The United States' military occupation of Lebanon threatens peace in the Middle East and is both a serious violation of the United Nations Charter and a threat to Arab countries that refuse to succumb to imperialism and decide to pursue an independent policy.
    "The United States government is using the domestic revolution in Lebanon, which has been going on for seven weeks, as an excuse to achieve its goals of occupying Lebanon and threatening independent countries in the Middle East.
    "This American aggression is being carried out under the false pretext of falsely accusing the United Arab Republic of interference, and this pretext has been officially denied by the first report of the United Nations Security Council's observer group sent to investigate the situation in Lebanon, which exposes the United States' intentions towards independent Arab countries and its attempt to force them to submit and rule them.
    "This aggression is also considered a farce, because it only exposes the fact that the United States' act of undermining the United Nations' resolutions and hindering its implementation steps shows that the United States ignores the United Nations Charter, and even ignores the existence of this organization and the value of this organization's activities.
    "Regarding the situation in Iraq, the government of the United Arab Republic declares that any aggression against the Arab Republic of Iraq will be regarded as an act of aggression against the United Arab Republic at the same time.
    "In this regard, the United Arab Republic will fulfill its obligations to the Republic of Iraq in accordance with the Arab Joint Defense Treaty."
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 17th—According to newspapers, Hosseini Aziz, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Republic, received the United States Ambassador to Cairo, Hale, on the 16th and declared to him that the United States' intervention in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries and the United States' military intervention in Lebanon may bring the most serious consequences to peace and security in the Middle East.
    According to newspapers, Aziz also made the same statement to the Turkish Chargé d'affaires in Cairo. "News" wrote that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Republic has asked the Turkish government to explain its attitude towards the situation in the Middle East.

    “美国的这种侵略是在诬赖阿拉伯联合共和国进行干涉的虚伪借口下进行的，而这种借口已经由联合国安全理事会派遣去调查黎巴嫩局势的观察团的第一个报告正式予以否认，这就暴露了美国对阿拉伯独立国家的意图，以及它要迫使它们屈服和统治它们的企图。
    “这种侵略也被认为是一出滑稽剧，因为它只是暴露出：美国破坏联合国的决议并且阻挠它的执行步骤这种行为表明，美国是无视联合国宪章的，甚至是无视这个组织的存在和这个组织的活动的价值的。
    “关于伊拉克的局势，阿拉伯联合共和国政府宣布：对于阿拉伯的伊拉克共和国的任何侵略将被认为同时是对阿拉伯联合共和国的侵略行为。
    “在这方面，阿拉伯联合共和国将根据阿拉伯联合防御条约，执行它对伊拉克共和国的义务。”
