    Local Methods for Making Fertilizer – Rich in Mass Experience
    Taking Local Materials, Experimenting in Many Ways
    Qinghai Peasants Use Plant Ash to Make Fertilizer
    (Reported by this newspaper) Agricultural cooperatives on the Qinghai plateau are actively using local methods to produce all kinds of chemical fertilizers. In Xining City, forty-eight agricultural cooperatives have already established local fertilizer factories. Datong County will also reach the goal of one factory per cooperative soon. Huangzhong, Minhe, Xunhua, and Huzhu (Autonomous Counties) are also catching up, striving to ensure that every cooperative can produce its own fertilizer in the short term.

    While learning from the experiences of other regions in fertilizer production, various localities are also promoting originality, taking local materials, and experimenting in many ways. In the Xining area, the method for making fertilizer involves filtering alkaline soil and plant ash (or horse manure ash) with boiling water. The resulting crystals are then boiled with water, mixed with a small amount of hide glue solution, spread out, and allowed to solidify and cool. One hundred catties of alkaline soil and one hundred catties of plant ash can yield twenty to twenty-two catties of fertilizer, which contains as much as 30% potassium. Agricultural cooperatives in Datong County have also successfully experimented with six other methods for producing local fertilizer. (Yang Liben)

    土法制化肥  群众经验多
    就地取材　多方试验
    青海农民用草木灰制化肥
    本报讯　青海高原上的农业社纷纷用土办法制造各式各样的化学肥料。西宁市最近已经有四十八个农业社建立了土化肥工场；大通县在最近也可以达到一社一场；湟中、民和和循化、互助两县（自治县）也都在急起直追，争取短期内社社都能自制化肥。
    各地在制肥中一面学习外地经验，一面发扬独创精神，就地取材，多方试验。西宁地区制肥的办法是把碱土、草木灰（或马粪灰）用开水过滤。捞出结晶体来掺水熬炼，加少量皮胶水摊和，凝固冷却即成。一百斤碱土和一百斤草木灰可提炼化肥二十到二十二斤，其中含钾素高达30％。大通县的农业社还试用其他六种办法制土化肥都获得成功。　（杨立本）
