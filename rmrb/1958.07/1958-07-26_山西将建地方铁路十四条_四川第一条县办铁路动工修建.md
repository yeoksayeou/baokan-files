    Shanxi to Build Fourteen Local Railways
    Sichuan's First County-Run Railway Begins Construction
    This newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 25th: The local railway from Guxian Town in Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, to Xincheng Town in PingShun County – the Xian'anli Railway – recently began construction. The railway is 72 kilometers long and will be built using a method of simultaneous design and construction. It is expected to be completed and open to traffic in September of this year.
    This railway is being constructed with the help of the Taiyuan Railway Administration of the Ministry of Railways for the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province. The Taiyuan Railway Administration is responsible for surveying, designing, and organizing the construction, as well as professional engineering tasks such as track laying, bridge erection, and communication signals; the Changzhi region is responsible for organizing agricultural cooperatives to provide labor for earthwork and stone work, as well as supplying building materials such as sleepers and rubble. The Shanxi People's Committee has also allocated some steel, cement, explosives and other materials. This railway will become the transportation lifeline for the development of local industry in the Changzhi region. The counties along the railway, such as Lu'an, Huguan, and Pingshun, are rich in coal and iron resources, and are the base for the development of local heavy industry.
    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, fourteen local railways will be built in Shanxi Province. The earthwork for these railways will be contracted out to the counties along the railway lines; the required labor force and materials such as crushed stone and sleepers will also be resolved through local sourcing. This will enable the province's local railway network to be basically completed ahead of schedule in 1961.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 25th: Sichuan Province's first county-run small railway—from Tianchi Township to Qingxikou in Guang'an County—is under construction.
    This railway is connected to the longest Huayingshan wooden rail slide in the province, and is more than ten kilometers long, with double tracks. Currently, the road builders are "building cloud ladders and bridges" in the mountains, constructing roadbeds, and erecting bridges and culverts. They are laying the line with light railway tracks from the mines. If there is not enough track, they are using wood rails wrapped in iron sheet to construct the double track railway. The locomotive is converted from a car head, and the carriages are also being designed and rushed to be made by themselves.

### 山西将建地方铁路十四条  四川第一条县办铁路动工修建

    山西将建地方铁路十四条
    四川第一条县办铁路动工修建
    本报太原25日电　山西省潞安县故县镇到平顺县新城的地方铁路——西安里铁路，最近动工建设。这条铁路全长七十二公里，采取边设计边施工的办法，预计在今年9月间建成通车。
    这条铁路是铁道部太原铁路管理局帮助山西长治专区建设的。太原铁路管理局担负线路的勘测、设计、施工组织工作和铁路铺轨、桥梁架设、通讯信号等专业工程任务；长治地区除组织农业社抽调木瓦工等劳力担负土石方工程外，还负责供给枕木、片石等建筑材料。山西人民委员会也拨给一部分钢筋、水泥、炸药等材料。这条铁路将成为长治地区发展地方工业的交通命脉。铁路沿线的潞安、壶关、平顺等县，煤铁资源很丰富，是当地发展重工业的基地。
    在第二个五年计划期间，山西省内将建设十四条地方铁路。这些铁路都将分别由铁路沿线的各县包干完成土方工程；所需劳动力和碎石、枕木等材料，也采取就地取材的办法解决。这样将使全省地方铁路网提前在1961年基本建成。
    据新华社成都25日电　四川省第一条县办的小铁路——广安县天池乡到清溪口的铁路，正在修建。
    这条铁路是同全省最长的华莹山木轨滑车道连接着的，长十公里多，并有复线。目前修路的人们正在山岭中“架云梯、搭天桥”，修路基，架桥涵。他们用矿山的轻便铁轨铺上线路，铁轨不够就用木轨包铁皮的办法架设铁道复线。火车头是利用汽车头改装的，车厢也正由自己设计和赶制。
