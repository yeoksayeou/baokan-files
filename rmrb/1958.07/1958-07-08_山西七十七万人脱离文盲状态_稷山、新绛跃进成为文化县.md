    Shanxi Province Eliminates Illiteracy for 770,000 People
    Jishan, Xinjiang Leap Forward to Become Cultural Counties
    (Our report) From April to June, Shanxi Province eliminated illiteracy for 530,000 people. Adding this to the 240,000-plus who graduated from January to April, a total of 770,000 people have escaped illiteracy in half a year, more than eight and a half times the total number of people graduating from literacy classes in the entire year of 1957.
    While making a great leap forward in literacy work, Jishan and Xinjiang counties have become cultural counties. As of now, Jishan County has had 52,537 young and middle-aged people (more than 90% of the county's total number of young and middle-aged people) shed the label of illiteracy. More than 80% of those who have eliminated illiteracy have been promoted to spare-time higher primary schools and spare-time secondary schools. 99% of school-age children in this county are enrolled in school. 95% of higher primary school graduates have been promoted to secondary schools. The county also has a Red and Expert University and a Red and Expert School for county-level cadres, and townships and communes have established Red and Expert Schools. The county established a Red and Expert Teachers' College to train teachers in rotation and has established weekly schools and correspondence schools (in-service training). The county established a Science Research Committee and a Science Research Institute, and townships established science guidance stations, communes established science research groups, and government agencies, enterprises, and schools all have science research institutions. The county has achieved people's hospitals, epidemic prevention stations, and maternal and child health stations, five market towns and townships have regional hospitals, townships have rural hospitals and maternity hospitals, communes have health stations, teams have health rooms, some communes have established bathhouses, and communes have nurseries. Each commune has a club (each township has a central club), an exhibition room, and a library. Communes have amateur theatrical troupes and literary creation groups, and teams have reading groups, blackboard newspaper groups, songwriting groups, and storytelling and ballad singing groups. Communes have stadiums and sports exercise groups, and more than 70% of male and female farmers participate in sports activities. On the basis of basically eliminating the "four pests", townships and communes have begun to fundamentally eliminate them.
    Xinjiang County has undergone three great leaps forward in the past six months, and 50,635 people in the county have escaped illiteracy, accounting for 96% of the total number of young and middle-aged people. 24,553 people have participated in spare-time higher primary schools, popularizing spare-time higher primary school education. This county is similar to Jishan County in popularizing science, running Red and Expert schools, clubs, and health undertakings.
    After Jishan and Xinjiang achieved the status of cultural counties, they formed a top-down political education network, cultural propaganda network, school education network, spare-time cultural and technical education network, science popularization network, and health care network, creating a socialist construction upsurge centered on technological revolution and cultural revolution.

    山西七十七万人脱离文盲状态
    稷山、新绛跃进成为文化县
    本报讯  山西省4至6月份共扫除文盲五十三万，连同1至4月份毕业的二十四万多人，半年共扫除文盲七十七万，等于1957年全年扫盲毕业总数的八倍半还多。
    在扫盲工作大跃进的同时，稷山和新绛两个县成了文化县。稷山县到目前为止，已有五万二千五百三十七名青壮年（占全县青壮年总数的90％以上）摘了文盲帽子。已扫除的文盲80％以上都升入业余高小和业余中学学习。这个县99％的学龄儿童入了学。95％的高小毕业生都升入了中学。这个县还有红专大学和县级干部红专学校各一所，乡和社都成立了红专学校。县成立一所教师红专师范学校，轮训教师，并设有星期学校和函授学校（在职进修）。县成立了科学研究委员会和科学研究所，乡乡都成立了科学指导站，社社成立了科学研究小组，机关企业学校都有科学研究机构。这个县做到县有人民医院、防疫站、妇幼保健站等医疗卫生机构，五个集镇乡都有地区医院，乡乡有农村医院和产院，社社有保健站，队队有保健室，部分社建立了澡塘，社社都有托儿所。每社都有一个俱乐部（每乡都有一个中心俱乐部），一个展览室和图书室。社社都有业余剧团和文艺创作组，队队都有读报组、板报组、歌词组、说唱组。社社都有体育场和体育锻炼小组，70％以上的男女农民都参加了体育活动。除四害讲卫生在基本四无的基础上，已出现了根本消灭四害的乡社。
    新绛县半年来经过三次跃进，全县已有五万零六百三十五人摆脱文盲状态，占青壮年总数的96％。有二万四千五百五十三人参加了业余高小，普及了业余高小教育。这个县在普及科学、举办红专学校、俱乐部、卫生事业等方面都同稷山县相仿佛。
    稷山和新绛实现文化县以后，形成了一个自上而下的政治教育网、文化宣传网、学校教育网、业余文化技术教育网、科学普及网、卫生保健网，出现了以技术革命和文化革命为中心的社会主义建设高潮。
