Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: The US and British imperialist armed aggression in the Middle East, and the continuous gathering of forces in an attempt to provoke war, has aroused resolute protests from 500 million peasants across China. The peasants strongly stated: "We want peace, not war!" "500 million peasants are not to be trifled with! Chinese peasants cannot turn a blind eye to the war conspiracies of US and British imperialism!"

Since the flames of war appeared in the Middle East, a wave of protests has erupted across China's vast territory, from cities to villages, from the interior to the border regions. In recent days, widespread protest rallies and demonstrations have been held in rural areas across the country, in villages and communes. According to preliminary statistics from fourteen provinces (autonomous regions), including Sichuan, Shandong, Hebei, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, nearly 100 million peasants have participated in demonstrations and protest rallies.

In Anhui Province alone, a total of 12 million peasants participated in large-scale demonstrations and protest rallies. In Sichuan Province, a total of 20 million people participated in protest activities in cities and villages, including more than 10 million peasants. In Zhejiang Province, located on the frontline of coastal defense, more than 21,000 agricultural cooperatives, with over 9.2 million peasants, held various protest activities, demanding that the US and British aggressors immediately stop setting fires in the Middle East. On hundreds of large and small islands in the Zhoushan Archipelago and on thousands of fishing boats that were fishing, protest calls echoed everywhere. Many fishermen wrote protest letters and big-character posters overnight, and resolutely demanded "Yankees get out of Taiwan!"

In many places, peasants worked hard during the day and held demonstrations at night with lanterns and torches. In many rural areas of Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei and other places, the silence of the night has been broken in recent days, and angry slogans echo across the fields.

At the protest rallies, Chinese peasants who had suffered hardships indignantly denounced the crimes of imperialism. In Shandong Province, Liu Lianren, a compatriot who had suffered cruel persecution by Japanese imperialism, told his fellow villagers that when imperialism invaded China, the Chinese people suffered unspeakable pain. Now that US and British imperialism are trying to launch a war and create new blood debts, we, the suffering people, will never allow it. Liu Lianren stated that he must do everything in his power to support the people of the Middle East and contribute to the defense of peace. Women from the Hulan Agricultural Cooperative in Yunzhou West Village, Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, the hometown of revolutionary heroine Liu Hulan, held a special meeting to denounce the blood feud with imperialism. In Jilin Province, some farmers angrily denounced the disasters suffered when American planes that invaded Korea bombed our peaceful cities. In Simao County on the Yunnan border, peasants of all ethnic groups angrily stated at the meeting: We must support the Arab people in repelling the attacks of the US and British aggressors.

In some remote villages, people organized propaganda teams and used various forms to spread the news and expose the crimes of US and British imperialism in creating war conspiracies. In Hebei Province, more than 810,000 people automatically formed propaganda teams in thirty counties and cities. In some townships in Hunan Province, every cooperative organized a propaganda team, putting up big-character posters, pasting slogans, and distributing mimeographed leaflets to quickly inform the masses of the most important news. Xunyi County in Shaanxi Province used wired broadcasting to hold a broadcast meeting attended by 120,000 peasants. After hearing the news of US and British aggression in the Middle East, members of more than 50 agricultural cooperatives wrote protest letters on the spot.

Amidst the protests, the vast number of peasants across the country have expressed their determination to ensure greater harvests, launch more agricultural production "satellites," and strengthen the forces defending peace. In many areas, peasants went to the fields to work overnight after the night marches. In Hailong County, Jilin Province, more than 3,000 peasants from eight agricultural cooperatives lit tens of thousands of lanterns and torches to water more than 100 hectares of fields that night after the evening meeting. In Bailu Township, Changsha County, Hunan Province, more than 7,000 people held a torchlight parade at night. After the parade, no one went home, and they worked in the fields all night long.

    愤怒的口号响遍原野　反侵略意义家喻户晓
    五亿农民坚决支援中东兄弟
    据新华社27日讯　美英帝国主义武装侵略中东，并且不断集结兵力企图挑起战争的阴谋活动，激起了全中国五亿农民的坚决抗议。农民们强烈地表示：“我们要和平、不要战争！”“五亿农民不是好惹的！中国农民不能对美英帝国主义制造战争的阴谋置之不理！”
    自从战争的火苗出现在中东以来，在我国广大的国土上，从城市到乡村，从内地到边疆，发出了一片抗议声。这几天来，全国广大农村中乡乡社社广泛地举行了抗议集会和示威游行。根据四川、山东、河北、安徽、浙江、湖南、江西、陕西、山西、辽宁、黑龙江、吉林、云南、内蒙古自治区十四个省（区）的初步统计，有将近一亿农民举行示威游行和抗议集会活动。
    安徽全省共有一千二百万农民举行了声势浩大的示威和抗议集会活动。四川省的城市和乡村共有两千万人参加了抗议活动，其中农民有一千多万。处在海防前线的浙江省，有二万一千多个农业社、九百二十多万农民举行了各种抗议活动，他们要求美英侵略者立即停止在中东放火。在舟山群岛几百个大小海岛和正在捕鱼的几千只渔船上，到处都响起了抗议的呼声，许多渔民连夜写抗议信和大字报，并且坚决要求“美国佬滚出台湾去！”
    许多地方的农民白天紧张地生产，夜晚举着灯笼火把示威游行。在辽宁、吉林、河北等地许多农村中，这几天打破了夜晚的沉静，愤怒的口号声响遍了原野。
    在抗议的集会上，受过苦难的中国农民激愤地控诉了帝国主义的罪行。在山东省，曾经受过日本帝国主义残酷迫害的难胞刘连仁对乡亲们说，帝国主义侵略中国时，使中国人民受尽了无法诉说的痛苦，现在美英帝国主义又想发动战争，制造新的血债，我们受难的人民绝不容许。刘连仁表示，我一定要尽所有的力量来支持中东人民，为保卫和平贡献力量。革命女英雄刘胡兰烈士的家乡山西省文水县云周西村胡兰农业社的妇女们，专门集会控诉了帝国主义的血海深仇。在吉林省，有的农民愤怒地控诉了当年侵略朝鲜的美国飞机轰炸我国和平城市时所遭受的灾难。云南边疆的思茅县，各族农民在会上愤怒地表示：一定要支持阿拉伯人民打退美英侵略者的进攻。
    在一些偏僻的乡村，人们组织宣传队和利用各种形式去传告消息，揭露美英帝国主义制造战争阴谋的罪行。河北省三十个县市群众自动组成的宣传队伍就有八十一万多人。湖南省有的乡里，社社都组织了宣传队，他们出大字报，贴标语，散发油印传单，把最重要的消息迅速地告诉群众。陕西省栒邑县利用有线广播召开了十二万农民参加的广播大会，农民们听到美英侵略中东的消息以后，当场有五十多个农业社的社员写了抗议书。
    全国广大农民在抗议声中，纷纷表示要保证争取更大的丰收，在农业生产上放出更多的“卫星”，来壮大保卫和平的力量。许多地区的农民在夜间游行以后，又连夜下田劳动。吉林省海龙县有八个农业社三千多农民在晚上集会以后，当晚就点起千万只灯笼火把浇了一百多公顷田。湖南省长沙县百禄乡七千多人在晚上举行了火炬游行，游行结束后，人们一个也没有回家，当晚下田整整干了一个通宵。
