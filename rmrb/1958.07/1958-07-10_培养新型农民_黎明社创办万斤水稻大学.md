Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 9th: The Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Lianhua Township, Haicheng County, Fujian Province, known throughout the country for its large-scale high-yield rice production, has established a 10,000 Jin Rice University. This university officially opened on the afternoon of July 7th. Ni Tianlin, Secretary of the Haicheng County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave the first lecture – a political lesson. In his lecture, Ni Tianlin called on all students to advance towards science with a fearless spirit, and to become new-type farmers with both rich production experience and abundant scientific theoretical knowledge.

This 10,000 Jin Rice University is headed by Yan Delong, Deputy Secretary of the Haicheng County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China stationed at the cooperative, as the President, and Huang Haicheng, a renowned agricultural labor model and Director of the Liming Cooperative, as the Vice President. The responsible persons of the county and township Party committees, some professors, lecturers, and technical cadres stationed at the cooperative researching rice cultivation techniques, as well as veteran farmer Pan Wumao and others, serve as teachers. Li Zhi, Associate Professor of the Soil Research Office of the Fujian Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, serves as the head of the teaching and research group. The first group of students includes all full-time cadres, production team leaders, technicians, and production activists in the cooperative, totaling one hundred and thirty-three people. Over the next two years, all students will systematically learn the basic knowledge of agricultural scientific theories such as soil, fertilizer, high-yield rice cultivation techniques, application of pesticides and machinery, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests through learning, doing, and summarizing experience. The scientific knowledge and production techniques learned by the students will be applied to practice and promoted to the vast number of cooperative members. The cooperative has specifically allocated a rice paddy field as the school's experimental field. All students were extremely excited after participating in the study and are determined to create high-yield achievements of more than 10,000 jin per mu on a larger area of late rice fields through learning and doing.

At the same time, the Longxi 10,000 Jin Rice University, sponsored by the Longxi County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China and located in the Zini Agricultural Cooperative in Chengnai Township, Longxi County, also opened on the morning of the 8th.
