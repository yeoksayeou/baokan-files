Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia, July 11th: The British colonial army continues to persecute Greek residents on the island of Cyprus.

Reports indicate that on July 8th, British troops groundlessly searched peaceful residents in the village of Tymbrou, near Nicosia, and beat two Greek residents to death. On July 10th, British troops dispatched a large number of soldiers to search villages in the northeastern part of the island, arresting many peaceful residents.

At the same time, Turkish thugs on the island continue to provoke Greek residents. On the evening of July 10th, a group of Turkish thugs armed with knives and clubs broke into a Greek Orthodox monastery in the southern part of the island and committed murder. Preliminary reports indicate that one nun and one monk have been killed, and many other nuns were injured. Near Nicosia, a Greek shepherd was beaten to death by Turkish thugs.

The British colonial authorities' connivance with Turkish thugs in committing crimes and the dispatch of troops to persecute Greek residents have aroused the anger and resistance of Greek residents. It is reported that Greek patriots, in retaliation for the two compatriots killed by the British colonial army on July 5th, killed two British soldiers in Famagusta Port on July 8th.

The "Struggle for Cyprus" organization distributed leaflets on July 9th, angrily condemning the British colonial army and Turkish thugs for jointly attacking Greeks. The leaflet stated: Despite the joint attacks by Britain and Turkey, we will never stop fighting until we achieve self-determination.
