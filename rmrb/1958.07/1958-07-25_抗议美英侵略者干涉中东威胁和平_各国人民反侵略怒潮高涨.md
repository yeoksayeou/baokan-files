    Protesting the US-British Aggressors' Interference in the Middle East Threatening Peace
    A High Tide of Anti-Aggression Fury Sweeps Across Peoples of All Countries
    India
    The high tide of Indian public anger protesting against the US-British imperialists' armed aggression in the Middle East has penetrated all strata of the Indian people.
    On July 21, a large-scale demonstration was held in Patiala, Punjab. The masses, holding portraits of "US-British Imperialism," marched through the streets to the city's main square, where they burned the portraits amid cheers.
    In the steel city of Jamshedpur and the coal city of Raniganj, workers held rallies. They voiced strong demands for the withdrawal of imperialist troops from the Middle East and congratulated the victory of the Republic of Iraq. Rallies and parades were held in some important cities in Punjab. The Umballa Defense Industries Employees Council also held a protest rally.
    Dange, General Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress, who recently attended the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau meeting, said in Bombay that he rushed back to India to organize worker demonstrations in support of the Arab countries' struggle for freedom and independence. He canceled his planned visit to Eastern European countries for this purpose.
    Philippines
    According to a report in the "Philippines Herald" on July 22, Filipino workers opposed the armed intervention by the United States and Britain in Middle Eastern countries. Cipriano Malonzo, president of the National Federation of Trade Unions said: "We are deeply disturbed by the unjustified and unfounded military intervention by the United States and the United Kingdom in order to obstruct the free exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of the Middle East.” He said that this right is a fundamental concept recognized and guaranteed by the United Nations Charter.
    It is reported that Malonzo had requested Manila Mayor Lacson to allow a demonstration in front of the US Embassy on the 26th to protest the US intervention in Middle Eastern countries. However, this request was rejected by Lacson.
    Italy
    The movement in Italy against US-British imperialist aggression in the Middle East is intensifying. The Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labour issued a statement expressing the solidarity of the Italian working people with the Arab people's struggle for independence. The statement emphasized that "actions must be taken without delay to safeguard peace and to make Italy a factor for peace in this tragic moment."
    A lengthy demonstration was held in Livorno on the evening of the 22nd. Demonstrators marched through the streets shouting slogans: "Down with the Aggressors!". Demonstrators posted large posters on the side of the US military command building, which read: "Americans, go home!".
    Demonstrations were also held in the cities of Ancona, Nicastro, Crotone and Massa Lombarda. Strikes were held in the cities of Ferrara, Catania and Siena Province to protest the actions of the Anglo-American interventionists.
    Austria
    The people of Vienna held a rally on the evening of the 22nd to protest against the US-British intervention in the Near and Middle East and the US violation of Austrian neutrality. Scherf, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party, spoke at the rally. He spoke of the just national liberation struggle of the Arab peoples and denounced the aggression of the US-British imperialists against the Near and Middle East. When talking about the US military aircraft infringing on Austrian airspace, he said: We welcome the Soviet government's endorsement of the Austrian government's protest, demanding respect for the rights of our small country.
    On the previous evening, leaflets were distributed around the US and British embassies in Vienna and in the vicinity.
    Albania
    Various mass rallies protesting against US-British aggression in the Near and Middle East continue to be held throughout Albania.
    After holding a rally, workers at a pharmaceutical factory in Tirana sent a protest telegram to Eisenhower. The telegram said: "We and the Arab people have both been oppressed by imperialism, which is why the Albanian people fully understand the suffering of the Arab people and fully support their struggle. Now that the sound of gunfire has begun, we must shout loudly to the imperialists: Stop!"
    Rallies protesting against US-British aggression were also held in areas such as Shkodër and Berat. (Xinhua News Agency)

    抗议美英侵略者干涉中东威胁和平
    各国人民反侵略怒潮高涨
    印度
    印度公众抗议美英帝国主义武装侵略中东的怒潮高涨，已经深入到印度人民的一切阶层。
    7月21日，在旁遮普邦巴地阿拉举行了大规模的示威游行，群众手持“美英帝国主义”画像通过大街来到城市的大广场，他们在欢呼声中把画像焚烧。
    在钢铁城市詹谢普尔和煤城腊尼甘季，工人们举行了大会。他们在会上发出了强有力的声音，要求帝国主义军队从中东撤退，并且祝贺伊拉克共和国的胜利。在旁遮普邦的一些重要城市都举行了集会和游行。翁巴拉国防工业雇员理事会也举行了抗议集会。
    最近参加世界工会联合会执行局会议的全印工会大会总书记丹吉在孟买说，他赶忙回到印度来是为了组织工人示威，支持阿拉伯国家为自由和独立而作的斗争。他为此取消了他预定的对东欧国家的访问。
    菲律宾
    据“菲律宾先驱报”22日报道，菲律宾工人反对美国和英国对中东国家进行武装干涉。菲律宾全国工会联合会主席拉克西纳说：“我们对于美国和联合王国为了阻挠中东人民自由行使自决权利而进行的毫无理由、毫无根据的军事干涉深为不安。”他说，这个权利是联合国宪章承认和保证的基本概念。
    据报道，拉克西纳曾经要求马尼拉市长拉克森准许于26日在美国大使馆前面举行示威，抗议美国干涉中东国家。但是这个要求遭到拉克森的拒绝。
    意大利
    意大利反对美英帝国主义侵略中东的运动正在加强。意大利总工会书记处发表声明，表示意大利劳动人民声援阿拉伯人民争取独立的斗争。声明强调指出，“必须刻不容缓地采取行动，以保卫和平，并使意大利在此悲剧时刻成为和平的因素”。
    22日晚上里窝那举行了长时间的示威游行。游行者喊着口号走过街道：“打倒侵略者！”。游行者在美国军事司令部的大厦边张贴了大幅招贴画，上面写道：“美国人，滚回家去！”。
    在安科纳、尼卡斯特罗、克罗多尼和马萨—伦巴第等城市也举行了示威游行。在斐拉拉、喀大尼亚市和西埃那省为了抗议英美干涉者的行为举行了罢工。
    奥地利
    维也纳人民在22日晚上举行大会，抗议美英对中近东的干涉和美国侵犯奥地利的中立。奥地利共产党中央委员会政治局委员谢尔夫在大会上讲了话。他谈到阿拉伯国家人民正义的民族解放斗争，并且痛斥美英帝国主义者对中近东的侵略。他在谈到美国军用飞机侵犯奥地利领空时说：苏联政府赞成奥地利政府的抗议，要求尊重我们小国的权利，我们对这表示欢迎。
    在前一天晚间，还有人在美英两国驻维也纳大使馆的四周及其邻近地区里散发了传单。
    阿尔巴尼亚
    阿尔巴尼亚全国各地抗议美英侵略中近东的各种群众集会还在继续举行。
    地拉那一间制药厂的工人举行集会后，给艾森豪威尔拍了一封抗议电。电文说：“我们和阿拉伯人民都受过帝国主义的压迫，这就是为什么阿尔巴尼亚人民充分了解阿拉伯人民的苦难和全力支持他们的斗争的原因。现在，枪声开始响了，我们必须向帝国主义者大喝一声：止住！”
    斯库台、培拉特等地区也举行抗议美英侵略的集会。（新华社）
