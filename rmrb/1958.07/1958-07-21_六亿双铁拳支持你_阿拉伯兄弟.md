　　More than 3,100 Muslims in Mengcun Hui Autonomous County held a protest rally today. The Ahong of the Mengcun Mosque and representatives from all walks of life, including farmers, youth, and women, expressed their full support for the just struggle of the Arab people. After the meeting, a demonstration was held in the villages near Mengcun.

Members of the Liuzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Tangshan City were busy planting summer potatoes and held discussions in the fields, expressing their full support for the solemn statements of the Chinese and Soviet governments. Members of the Mengjiang and Shihe Agricultural Cooperatives in Qinhuangdao City also held symposiums in the fields on opposing the armed aggression of the U.S. and British imperialists in the Middle East.
　　Zhejiang
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 19th. Six hundred thousand workers in Zhejiang Province have gathered to oppose the U.S. and British military aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and are taking practical actions to speed up construction and strengthen the forces for defending world peace.
　　In the last three days, hundreds of thousands of workers from large enterprises such as the Zhejiang Iron and Steel Plant, General Machinery Plant, Flax Textile Factory, Silk Factory, to the county and township factories in the vast countryside, have angrily denounced the criminal acts of U.S. and British imperialist aggression.
　　The anger of the broad masses of workers against the U.S. and British aggressors has further fueled the demand to accelerate the pace of our country's construction and strengthen the forces for defending world peace. The Zhejiang Iron and Steel Plant was installing a No. 2 blast furnace with a volume of 82 cubic meters, which was originally planned to be installed in 130 days. After the U.S. and British invading forces entered Lebanon and Jordan, the workers worked day and night, completing the installation of the blast furnace in 65 days ahead of schedule, and it was put into production on the 19th. Now this factory is using indigenous methods to build 100 small blast furnaces with a volume of 8 cubic meters, ensuring that iron is produced before National Day. The youth design team of the Hangzhou General Machinery Plant, after a meeting, began designing a 12,500 cubic meter oxygen generator, striving to successfully trial-produce it and put it into production before next year's National Day, in order to increase steel and strengthen the forces of the socialist peace camp.

The workers and peasants are determined to use their practical actions to increase production and strengthen the forces for defending peace.
　　Workers in Huangshi City proposed at mass rallies and mass meetings in major factories and mines that the Daye Steel Plant should work hard for six months to exceed the original plan by 70% in steel production, and the Huaxin Cement Plant should produce 100,000 tons more cement this year, to strengthen the forces for peace and oppose the U.S. and British aggressors.
　　After listening to the situation of the Wuhan rally against U.S. and British aggression in the Middle East on the radio yesterday, cadres and members of agricultural cooperatives in the vast countryside also held protest meetings or symposiums. The peasants resolutely demanded that the U.S. and British imperialist aggressive forces get out of Lebanon and Jordan.

Tens of thousands of Muslims also participated in the demonstration march today.
　　Before the demonstration march, a mass rally was also held. Ren Gebai, First Secretary of the Urumqi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the rally that the people of all ethnic groups in Urumqi resolutely demanded that the U.S. and British invading forces get out of Lebanon and Jordan. He called on the people of all ethnic groups to resolutely develop industrial and agricultural production and various constructions at a flying speed with soaring enthusiasm, strengthen the socialist camp and the forces of world peace, and fully support the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq. Representatives of workers, peasants, students, youth, women, soldiers, religious circles, and business circles spoke at the meeting. Yimin Mahesumu, director of the Islamic Association of the Autonomous Region, warned the imperialists on behalf of more than 4 million Muslims of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to immediately stop this crazy war provocation. All Muslims resolutely support the just struggle of the Arab people, and will never give up until the aggressive actions and sinister conspiracies of U.S. and British imperialism are shattered.

Railway worker Sun Dexian had his right hand blown off and half of his head burned by U.S. imperialist bombs, turning him into a disabled person. He angrily said: "We the working class resolutely demand peace and oppose war. If the U.S. and British imperialists insist on launching a war of aggression, I will use one hand to support the Arab people." Zhou Xuemin, a housewife whose husband was killed by American bombs, said even more hatefully: "The U.S. and British imperialists are biting people everywhere like mad dogs. We, the peace-loving people of the world, must beat them until their heads are broken and blood is flowing, and never let them kill kind and happy people again."
