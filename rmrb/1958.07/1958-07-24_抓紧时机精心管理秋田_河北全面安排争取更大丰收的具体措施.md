(Reported by this newspaper from Tianjin on July 23) The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is actively implementing the spirit of the North China Six Provinces and Cities Agricultural Cooperation Conference held in Zhengzhou. From July 21st to 22nd, a meeting of prefectural committee secretaries was held. At the meeting, all localities decided to strive for a bumper autumn harvest, and also arranged production plans for next year, requiring an even greater summer harvest next year.

The meeting believed that: because the province has generally had soaking rains, the drought has been relieved, and various crops are growing well, especially because the summer harvest has brought great encouragement and full confidence to the people, which is an extremely favorable situation for achieving a bumper harvest this year. Therefore, the important issue at present is to take advantage of the favorable situation, in the current critical season of crop growth, seize the opportunity, and conscientiously, diligently, and carefully strengthen field management of major autumn crops. The following specific measures were proposed:

First, strengthen meticulous management by calculating accounts by plot, measuring grain by plant, and determining measures based on yield. Grasp high-yield fields, general fields, and third-class seedlings simultaneously. Oppose the idea of favoring one over the other, and launch a "five catch up to one" movement, making a ten-day blitz, so that within ten days all third-class communes, third-class land, third-class plots, third-class seedlings, and third-class plants catch up to first-class.

Second, vigorously promote the "Three Generalizations." Strive for five fertilizations, seven irrigations, and eight cultivations for all crops, achieving garden-like cultivation. Strengthen special management for different crops. Cotton should be meticulously pruned, branches removed, and bolls protected to promote early maturity; peanuts should be ridged and vines pressed; sweet potatoes should have their vines lifted and fertilizer applied in the cracks; corn should be earthed up, and artificial pollination should be universally carried out, and so on.

Third, universally carry out the "Four No's" movement. Mobilize every commune and keep everyone busy, taking various revolutionary measures to remove weeds, eliminate pests, and prevent diseases, ensuring that there are no insects in the fields, no weeds in the land, and no diseased plants among the crops. At the same time, mobilize the strength of youth, women, the elderly, children, militias, students, and other sectors, and use all idle land to plant large quantities of melons, vegetables, miscellaneous grains, forage, and green manure crops, ensuring that no commune has idle land.

In order to ensure the implementation of the above measures, the meeting believed that it is also necessary to do the following well: 1. Put politics in command and use the abstract to lead the concrete. Take the general line as the guiding principle and strive for a bumper autumn harvest as the center, mobilize the masses to carry out great debates, thoroughly criticize right-leaning conservative thinking, the "condition theory," and the "production bottoming out theory," and fiercely attack "skeptics," "wait-and-seeers," and "second guessers," so that everyone recognizes the great significance of the autumn harvest, gives play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, holds high the red flag, advances victoriously, and strives for a bumper autumn harvest. 2. Divide the battle lines and organize the labor force well, taking responsibility to the end. Provinces, special districts, counties, townships, and communes must establish a battle line for a great autumn harvest, with special districts responsible for counties, counties responsible for townships, townships responsible for communes, communes responsible for plots, and commune members responsible for ridges and plants, resolutely taking responsibility to the end. 3. Promote the six "deliveries to the fields" (delivering meals, milk, doctors, tool repairs, learning, and debates) to improve production efficiency. 4. Conduct universal inspections, classify and rank, and launch a movement to pull down white flags and raise red flags. Organize comprehensive inspections, looking at both the good and the bad. Classify and rank by crop, and manage by plot and by plant, find loopholes, tap potential, and determine measures plot by plot and plant by plant.

Regarding striving for a greater summer harvest next year, the important issue is to increase the yield per unit area. To this end, the meeting believed that the following measures must be implemented: First, resolutely deep plow the land and rationally organize the labor force, deep plowing while harvesting, to a depth of 1.5 to 3 feet, so that the roots of the crops are fully developed and absorb more nutrients. Second, apply more base fertilizer, requiring 30,000 to 50,000 jin per mu, and 100,000 jin for high-yield fields. Therefore, launch a large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement throughout the province. Third, vigorously develop water conservancy projects, realizing water conservancy, well development, and garden-like fields, to ensure "full seedlings even without spring rain, and a bumper harvest even without rain all year." In addition, the selection of seeds and close planting must also be resolutely implemented to ensure a bumper harvest.

The meeting pointed out that to strive for a bumper autumn harvest this year and a bumper summer harvest next year, the required labor force must be increased by one to two times, and the key to solving this problem lies in reforming tools. Therefore, it is necessary to immediately take action and quickly launch a vigorous, large-scale, and magnificent upsurge in agricultural tool reform, focusing on the reform of water conservancy, deep plowing, close planting, and harvesting and processing tools; and to make all rotating tools ball-bearingized, basically realizing semi-mechanization. It is required to work hard and practically from now on, basically changing the backward state of agricultural tools in three months, and basically eliminating old-fashioned agricultural tools in one autumn and one winter. Before autumn, more than 10 million pieces of agricultural tools must be reformed, so that the autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing are completely replaced by new and improved agricultural tools.

The meeting believed that the central issue in striving for a bumper harvest lies in implementing the mass line working methods and leadership methods, leading the masses and cadres, and combining the crash and regular working methods, continuously organizing upsurges, and leading the masses to advance.

At present, a booming movement to strive for an even greater harvest has been widely launched throughout the province.

    抓紧时机精心管理秋田
    河北全面安排争取更大丰收的具体措施
    本报天津23日电　中共河北省委积极贯彻在郑州举行的华北六省市农业协作会议的精神，在7月21日到22日召开地委书记会议。会上，各地都决定力争秋季大丰收，同时还安排了明年的生产计划，要求明年夏收作物获得更大丰收。
    会议认为：由于全省已普降透雨，旱象解除，各种作物生长良好，特别是由于夏季丰收给人民带来了极大的鼓舞和充分的信心，是实现今年大丰收极为有利的形势。因此，当前的重要问题就在于利用有利的形势，在目前作物生长的关键季节，抓紧时机，认真、勤快、细心地加强大秋作物的田间管理。并且提出了以下具体措施：
    第一、按块算账、按棵计粮、按产量定措施，加强精细管理。丰产田、一般田、三类苗一齐抓。反对厚此薄彼思想，开展“五赶一”运动，来一个十天突击，在十天内使所有三类社、三类地、三类块、三类苗、三类棵都赶上一类。
    第二、大搞“三普”。各种作物要力争作到五肥七水八中耕，实现耕作园田化。对不同作物要加强特殊管理。棉花要精细整枝打杈、保好蕾铃，力促早熟；花生培垅压蔓；甘薯要手提蔓、灌缝追肥；玉米要培土，普遍进行人工辅助授粉等等。
    第三、普遍开展“四无”运动。社社发动，人人不闲，采取各种革命措施，除草、灭虫，预防病害，作到田里无虫、地里无草、作物无病棵。同时动员起青年、妇女、老年、儿童、民兵、学生等各方面的力量，利用一切闲散地大量种植瓜菜、杂粮、饲草饲料、绿肥作物，作到社社无闲地。
    为了保证实现以上措施，会议认为还必须作好：一、政治挂帅，以虚带实。以总路线为纲，以争取秋季大丰收为中心，发动群众开展大辩论，彻底批判右倾保守思想，“条件论”、“生产到底论”，痛击“怀疑派”“观潮派”“秋后算账派”，使大家认识秋季丰收的重大意义，发挥群众的积极性创造性，高举红旗，乘胜前进，力争秋季大丰收。二、划分战线，很好地组织劳动力，包干到底。省、专、县、乡、社要建立大搞秋季丰收的战线，专包县，县包乡，乡包社，社包块，社员包垅、包棵，坚决负责到底。三、推行六（送饭、喂奶、医生、修理工具、学习、辩论）到田，提高生产效率。四、普遍检查，分类排队，开展拔白旗插红旗运动。要组织全面检查，既要看好的，也要检查坏的。按作物分类排队，按地块、按棵进行管理，找漏洞，挖潜力，逐块逐棵定措施。
    关于争取明年夏季更大的丰收，重要的问题是要提高单位面积的产量。为此，会议认为必须贯彻以下措施：第一、坚决深翻土地，合理组织劳动力，一面收割就一面深翻，要深翻一点五尺到三尺，使作物的根部得到充分发展，多吸收营养。第二、多施底肥，要求每亩达到三——五万斤，丰产田要达到十万斤。因而，要在全省范围内大搞积肥运动。第三、大搞水利建设，实现水利化、井化、园田化，以保证“春不下雨保全苗，年不下雨保丰收”。此外，对于选种和密植也要坚决贯彻执行，才能使丰收得到保证。
    会议指出：要争取今年大秋丰收和明年夏季丰收，所需劳动力要增加一倍到两倍，解决的关键在于改工具。因此，就必须立即行动起来，迅速掀起一个声势浩大规模壮阔的农具改革高潮，突出的抓住水利、深翻、密植和收获、加工工具的改革；并要使一切转动工具都滚珠轴承化，基本上实现半机械化，要求从现在开始，苦干实干，三个月基本改变农具落后的面貌，一秋一冬，基本消灭旧式农具。在秋前要改革农具一千万件以上，使秋收、秋种、秋耕完全用新式农具和改良农具代替旧式农具。
    会议认为争取大丰收的中心问题，还在于贯彻群众路线的工作方法和领导方法，领导群众和干部，并且把突击的与经常的工作方法结合起来，不断的组织高潮，领导群众前进。
    目前，一个轰轰烈烈的争取更大的丰收运动已在全省范围内广泛展开。
