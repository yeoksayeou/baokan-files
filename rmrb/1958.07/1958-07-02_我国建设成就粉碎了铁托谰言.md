    China's Construction Achievements Shatter Tito's Slander
    Tito's claim that we are trying to solve our difficulties by criticizing Yugoslav revisionism is a complete slander against the Chinese Communist Party and our country. We ourselves have said that our country is poor and blank. But no matter how poor we are, we will not wag our tails and beg for aid from American imperialism like Tito, selling ourselves for assistance. The industrious and brave Chinese people, with a glorious tradition, are today, under the leadership of the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao, building our socialist motherland with soaring enthusiasm. Our summer grain production this year has increased by nearly 60% compared to last year, and future construction achievements will be even greater. We greatly respect international mutual assistance among socialist countries, but we also know the importance of self-reliance. We must use new construction achievements to shatter this shameless slander!

    我国建设成就粉碎了铁托谰言
    铁托说我们想以对南斯拉夫修正主义的批判来解决我们的困难，这完全是对中国共产党和我们国家的污蔑。我们自己说过我国一穷二白。但是我们再穷，也不会像铁托一样向美帝国主义摇尾乞怜，卖身求援。富有光荣传统的勤劳勇敢的中国人民，今天在伟大的共产党和毛主席的领导下，正以冲天的干劲，建设我们社会主义的祖国。我国今年的夏粮就比去年增产了将近60％，今后建设的成就还将更为巨大。我们非常尊重社会主义国家的国际互助，但是我们更知道自力更生的重要。我们一定要用新的建设成就来粉碎这种无耻的污蔑！
