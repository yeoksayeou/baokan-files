A Red Flag in the Technological Innovation of the Coal Industry
By Our Correspondent Tang Tianzhen

It has always been thought that "to extract coal, you need to exchange pit props for it." However, the horizontal layered coal mining method using integrated mobile metal supports, collectively researched and successfully developed by the workers of the Datong Coal Mine in Huainan under the initiative of Party Secretary Liu Lixun, broke through this convention and created the miracle of coal mining faces without pit prop supports.

A Shared Aspiration

In the past, over 80% of the coal mining faces at the Datong Coal Mine used the bamboo mat false roof method with pillars. Coal mining required many pit prop supports for protection. In February of this year, this old mine consumed an average of thirty-one cubic meters of pit props for every thousand tons of coal mined, costing more than 2,200 yuan. Moreover, this mining method was unsafe, the operating procedures were complex, and production efficiency was low. However, for many years, people had always thought of this as an "unchangeable" and "fixed" mining method. The belief at that time was: "Pneumatic drills are all-powerful, mining methods are fixed, and major reductions in pit props are impossible."

The situation of the Great Leap Forward made the shortcomings of this mining method even more prominent. How to safely reduce pit prop consumption and achieve a Great Leap Forward in production in a faster, better, and more economical way was a problem that every worker was considering. One day in late March, after work, Liu Lixun, the Party Secretary of the mine, attended a discussion meeting with the workers of the No. 4 Coal Mining Team. Old worker Guo Zhichang said: "We use the bamboo mat false roof method with pillars here, it's simply like filling it with pit props. How can we have a Great Leap Forward?" Workers suggested that the coal in our No. 5 slot is only about one meter wide, we can use the method of not using pillars and not using bottom beams, and people can mine coal standing at the entrance of the tunnel, which is both easier and saves wood.

Mining coal without pit prop supports, this bold idea frightened some engineers and technicians. They said: We tried it before, and it failed. It is useless to try again. However, the mine Party committee believed that since the workers wanted to do it, it might have some merit; even if the experiment failed, the reasons for the failure must be found.

At this time, experimental fields were starting to be developed vigorously across the country. The CPC Datong Mine Party Committee organized twenty-one cadres and started an experimental field in the No. 4 Coal Mining Team. They wanted to better lead production by participating in production, and also wanted to experiment and appraise the mining method proposed by the workers of this team.

When the experiment began, due to a lack of technical control, it failed for several shifts in a row because of caving gangue. The mine Party committee repeatedly supported the workers of the No. 4 Coal Mining Team to continue the experiment, and helped them find the reasons for the caving gangue. The cadres who were working on the experimental field observed during on-site labor, and held symposiums and individual talks to mobilize the workers to analyze and study. From the lessons of repeated failures, they finally discovered the key to the caving gangue and took many measures to stop it.

The phenomenon of caving gangue was initially controlled, and the consumption of pit props was also significantly reduced, but the threat to production safety had not been eliminated. A sense of responsibility for the lives of the workers prompted everyone to constantly find ways to solve this problem.

After a period of on-site labor and practical learning, Party Secretary Liu Lixun had grasped some of the laws of coal mine production and learned some production knowledge. From the observation and analysis of several caving gangue phenomena, he came up with an idea - make a steel support to resist the roof and gangue, and wouldn't it be safer for workers to produce? This idea, which came from real life, seemed simple and unsophisticated, but it outlined the prototype of a major technological reform in the coal industry.

Collective Creation

Liu Lixun discussed his ideas with many workers. Everyone agreed that making a steel support was a good way to prevent gangue from rushing out and the roof from collapsing. The workers put forward many valuable suggestions on how to make this steel support. However, what was worrying was: Could this support move forward? According to general understanding, the support would be impossible to drag if it was pressed by gangue in the tunnel. However, Liu Lixun, after repeated on-site observation and research, made an affirmative answer. He found from several gangue rushing out situations that there was a huge impulse when gangue rushed out. By using this impulse and then using traction equipment to pull, the steel support could be moved forward. This principle was quickly accepted by the workers. They started the experiment immediately.

In the process of the experiment, the workers also broke many conventions and regulations, reduced some unnecessary reporting and approval procedures, and fully exerted the power of cooperation from various departments of the mine. The high degree of enthusiasm and creativity of the workers quickly turned the idea into reality. In one week, the experiment was successful. Wang Hongchang, the head of the Mechanical and Electrical Department, went down the well several times, carefully observed the situation of the coal mining face, and provided many valuable suggestions on the shape and structure of the metal support. Liang Baogang, a technician from the No. 2 Coal Mining Area, drew the design drawings of the metal support in a very short time. The mechanical and electrical workers temporarily stopped other unimportant work and made the metal support in just over a day. As soon as the metal support was made, the workers of the No. 4 Team installed it on the coal mining face. Sun Jingbiao, the leader of the safety supervision team stationed at the mine by the Huainan Mining Bureau, stayed in the mine for a day and night, mastering the installation and use.

Sure enough, in the first few shifts of the experiment, this metal support moved forward as people had envisioned. The news spread throughout the mine, and the workers were all elated. However, at this time, some people also said: The No. 4 Coal Mining Team is mining a narrow coal seam, and the roof and floor are good, this support cannot be used in other locations. The workers of the No. 4 Coal Mining Team decided to conduct experiments in Nanba Cao, where the geological conditions were the most complex, the roof and floor were the worst, and the coal seam was wider. They made some improvements to the structure of the metal support according to different geological conditions, and as a result, it was also successfully used in the Nanba Cao coal seam.

Soon after the successful experiment of this mining method, the reporter rushed to the scene for a visit. In the coal mining field, the towering pit prop supports were no longer visible, only a steel-structured cabin-type support stood in the tunnel. It tightly controlled the roof and floor, and the threat of roof collapse and gangue rush could no longer be felt on the coal mining face.

The workers gave this metal support an affectionate name: "Little Iron Ox." They also composed ditties to praise it. One ditty says all its benefits:

"Iron Ox" is really good, works hard and doesn't eat grass,
Safety is guaranteed, fewer operating procedures,
Reduces labor, greatly improves efficiency,
Low pit prop consumption, low ash content,
This mining method is incomparable to others.

The creation of the integrated mobile metal support horizontal layered coal mining method by the workers of the Datong Mine is a red flag in technological innovation. This red flag not only bears the victory of coal miners in solving a major problem in coal production - improving the support work of coal mining faces, but also bears the victory of the liberation of the minds of the working people and the advance of enterprise cadres towards becoming both red and expert!

    煤炭工业革新技术的一面红旗
    本报记者　汤天真
    向来人们就认为：“要想出煤炭，就要坑木换”。可是，淮南大通煤矿职工在党委书记刘立勋同志的倡议下，集体研究成功的整体移动金属支架水平分层采煤法，却冲破了这种陈规，创造了采煤工作面不用坑木支柱的奇迹。
    共同的愿望
    过去，大通煤矿的采煤工作面，80％以上都采用打柱子的竹笆假顶采煤法。采煤时，需要许多坑木支柱做掩护。今年2月份，这个老矿每采一千吨煤平均就要消耗三十一立方公尺的坑木，合两千二百多元。而且，这种采煤方法不安全，操作程序复杂，生产效率低。但是，多少年来，人们一直认为这是一种“不能改变”的、“定了型”的采煤方法。那时的信条是：“风镐万能，采煤方法定型，坑木大减不行”。
    生产大跃进的形势，使这一采煤方法的缺点暴露得更突出了。如何在安全的条件下，减少坑木消耗，多快好省地实现生产大跃进，是每个职工都在考虑的问题。3月底有一天下班以后，这个矿的党委书记刘立勋同志参加了采煤四队工人们的讨论会。老工人郭志昌说：“我们这里用打柱子的竹笆假顶采煤法，简直是拿坑木往里填，怎么能大跃进呢？”工人们纷纷提出：我们五槽的煤只有米把宽，可以用不打柱子、不下底梁的方法，人站在峒子口采煤，这样既省劲，又省木料。
    不用坑木支柱采煤，这个大胆的念头把一些工程技术人员吓住了。他们说：过去试验过，结果失败了，再试验也是枉然。可是，矿党委认为：既然工人都想这样做，就可能有一定的道理；即使试验失败了，也要把失败的原因找出来。
    这时候，全国各地正开始轰轰烈烈地搞试验田。中共大通矿党委便组织了二十一名干部，在采煤四队搞起了试验田。他们既是想通过参加生产来更好地领导生产，也是想把这个队的工人提出的采煤办法进行试验和鉴定。
    开始试验的时候，由于技术上掌握不住，连续几班都因为窜矸石而失败了。矿党委一再支持采煤四队的工人继续试验，帮助他们寻找矸石外窜的原因。搞试验田的干部一面和工人一起在现场劳动中进行观察，一面召开座谈会和个别交谈，发动工人进行分析研究。他们从多次失败的教训中，终于发现了矸石外窜的关键，采取了许多措施，制止了矸石外窜的现象。
    窜矸石的现象是初步制止住了，坑木消耗也显著降低，但是生产不安全的威胁还没有消除。对工人生命负责的责任感，促使大家不停地设法解决这一问题。
    经过一个时期的现场劳动和实际学习，党委书记刘立勋同志已经摸到了煤矿生产的一些规律，学到了一些生产知识。他从几次矸石外窜现象的观察和分析中，产生了这样一种念头——做一个钢铁支架，抗住顶板和矸石，工人生产起来不就安全了吗？这种从实际生活中产生的想法，看来是朴素而简单，然而它却为煤炭工业的一项重大的技术改革勾画了一个雏形。
    集体的创造
    刘立勋把他的想法同很多工人进行了研究。大家一致认为，做一个钢铁支架是防止矸石外冲和顶板塌落的好办法。工人们对这个钢铁支架的做法提出了很多宝贵的意见。可是，令人忧虑的是：这个支架能不能向前移动？根据一般人的见解，支架在坑道里被矸石压住是拖不动的。但是，刘立勋经过反复地在现场观察和研究，做出了肯定的回答。他从几次矸石外窜的情况中发现，矸石外窜时有巨大的冲力，借着这种冲力，再用牵引设备一拖，钢铁支架是可以向前移动的。这道理，很快就被工人接受了。说干就干，采煤四队的工人立即开始了试验。
    在试验过程中，职工们又打破了许多陈规戒律，减少了一些不必要的呈报审批手续，充分发挥了矿上各部门协作的力量。职工们高度的积极性和创造性，很快地使设想变成了现实。一个星期，试验就成功了。机电科科长王洪昌跑到井下去好几次，详细地观察了采煤工作面的情况，对金属支架的造形和结构提供了很多宝贵的意见。采煤二区技术员梁保刚，在很短的时间内就画好了金属支架的设计图。机电工人暂时停下了其他不紧要的工作，在一天多的时间内就把金属支架作好。金属支架一做好，四队工人就在采煤工作面安装起来。淮南矿务局驻矿安全监查组组长孙景标一天一夜没睡觉，在井下掌握安装和使用。
    果然不错，在试验的头几班，这个金属支架就按着人们的设想向前移动了。消息传出，全矿轰动，工人们都欢欣鼓舞。可是，这时候也有人说：采煤四队采的是窄煤层，顶板、底板好，这个支架在其他地点就不能用了。采煤四队的工人便决定到地质条件最复杂、顶板底板最坏、煤层较宽的南八槽去进行试验。他们根据不同的地质情况，把金属支架的结构做了一些改进，结果在南八槽煤层也顺利地使用了起来。
    这一采煤方法试验成功不久，记者就赶到现场进行了参观。在采煤场子里，已经看不到林立的坑木支柱，只见一个钢铁结构的舱式支架矗立在坑道里。它严密地控制着顶板底板，在采煤工作面上，已经感觉不到顶板垮落和矸石外窜的威胁了。
    工人们给这个金属支架起了一个爱称：
  “小铁牛”。他们还编了顺口溜来歌颂它。有一首顺口溜道尽了它的好处：
    “铁牛”真正好，出力不吃草，
    安全有保证，操作程序少，
    减轻劳动力，效率大提高，
    坑木消耗低，灰分含的少，
    这种采煤法，其他比不了。
    大通矿职工创造整体移动金属支架水平分层采煤法，是革新技术的一面红旗。这面红旗上不仅书写着煤矿工人解决煤炭生产的一个重大问题——改进采煤工作面支架工作的胜利，还书写着劳动人民思想解放、企业干部向又红又专进军的胜利！
