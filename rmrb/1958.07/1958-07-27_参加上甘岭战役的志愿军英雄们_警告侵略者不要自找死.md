Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The heroes of the Volunteer Army returning home, who once struck fear into the enemy on Shangganling, have issued a warning to the American and British invading forces in the Middle East: "Do you want to taste the bitterness of defeat at Shangganling again in the Middle East?" The heroes also firmly stated that they will always be loyal to the cause of world peace and resolutely support the just struggle of the Arab people.

This returning Volunteer Army hero unit has been angered by the heinous actions of the American and British imperialists in invading the Middle East for days. Many people could not restrain their anger and repeatedly shouted "Yankees get out of Lebanon!" "British troops get out of Jordan!" "Support the just struggle of the Arab people!" at meetings denouncing the piratical behavior of American and British imperialism. The officers and soldiers also repeatedly pointed out with contempt, based on the serial numbers of the American and British invading forces landing in the Middle East, that these remnants defeated by the Chinese and Korean people actually dare to dig their own graves in the Middle East! It is truly like moths flying into a flame, courting death.

Many Volunteer Army officers and soldiers who participated in the Battle of Shangganling used their personal experiences to illustrate that the American invading forces have the characteristics of bullying the weak and fearing the strong, being greedy for life and afraid of death, and being defeated in every battle against the righteous people. General Zhou Fatian, who participated in commanding the Battle of Shangganling, said that American imperialism is good at bluffing. If you are intimidated by it, it will become more aggressive and expand its aggression. Only by resolutely striking it and making it lower its head, can it be stopped. At the beginning of the Battle of Shangganling, it seemed very fierce. In the most intense day and night, it fired more than 300,000 artillery shells and hundreds of heavy bombs at Shangganling, an area of less than four square kilometers. However, it could not scare the Chinese and Korean People's Army. After the Chinese and Korean People's Army annihilated more than 25,000 of them, it had to lower its head again and sit down to negotiate an armistice with us.

Wan Fulai, the company commander of the company where Huang Jiguang was, talked about their sniper movement on Shangganling, which made the U.S. military "lower their heads." In more than seven months, they eliminated more than 900 enemies. Zhou Jicheng, a recoilless gun sniper, destroyed 25 enemy firepower points and destroyed one enemy tank by himself. He said, don't listen to the US military bragging about good equipment, in fact, their tactics are poor, they are greedy for life and afraid of death, and cannot withstand a single blow.

The returning Volunteer Army officers and soldiers unanimously angrily warned the war mongers to be sober, remember the lessons of the惨败 (a crushing defeat) at Shangganling, and in this era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, do not play with fire and burn yourselves, and get out of the Middle East immediately.

    参加上甘岭战役的志愿军英雄们
    警告侵略者不要自找死路
    新华社26日讯　曾经在上甘岭上打得敌人胆战心惊的志愿军归国部队英雄们向开到中东的美英侵略军提出警告：“你们还想在中东尝一尝上甘岭失败的滋味吗？”英雄们并且坚决表示：他们永远忠于世界和平事业，坚决支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。
    这支归国的志愿军英雄部队连日被美英侵略中东的罪恶行动激怒了。许多人抑制不住愤怒的心情，在声讨美英帝国主义海盗行为的大会上一再高呼“美军滚出黎巴嫩”“英军滚出约旦”“支援阿拉伯人民的正义斗争”。官兵们并且根据在中东登陆的美英侵略军的番号，一再轻蔑地指出，这些中朝人民手下的残兵败将，竟又胆敢到中东去自掘坟墓啦！真是飞蛾投火，自找死路。
    许多参加过上甘岭战役的志愿军官兵都用亲身经历说明，美国侵略军是有欺软怕硬、贪生怕死和在正义的人民面前每战必败的特点。参加指挥上甘岭战役的周发田将军说，美帝国主义是惯会吓唬人的。如果你被它吓住了，它就会得寸进尺扩大侵略，只有坚决打击它，打得它低下头来。在上甘岭战役开始，看来它也是很凶的。最多的一昼夜曾向上甘岭不足四平方公里的地方发了三十多万发大炮弹和数百颗重型炸弹，但是，它吓不倒中朝人民军队，当中朝人民军队消灭了它两万五千多人之后，它就只好又缩起头坐下来和我们进行停战谈判了。
    黄继光所在连队连长万福来谈到了他们在上甘岭上开展狙击手运动，打得美军“低下头来”的情形。他们在七个多月中就消灭了敌人九百多名。无后坐力炮狙击手周记成一个人就摧毁了敌人二十五个火力点、击毁敌军坦克一辆。他说，别听美军吹嘘装备好，实际上战术低劣，贪生怕死，经不起一击。
    归国的志愿军官兵们一致愤怒警告战争贩子们要清醒点，记住上甘岭惨败的教训，在这东风压倒西风的时代，不要玩火自焚，立即滚出中东去。（附图片）
