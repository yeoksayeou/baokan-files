    The Ceramic Industry Directly Serves Production
    Hebei Decides to Trial-Produce New Products Such as High-Temperature Chemical Porcelain

    (Our report) The Hebei Province recently held a ceramic industry leap forward meeting, which determined a new direction for the province's ceramic industry: vigorously develop ceramic products that directly serve industrial and agricultural production.

    The ceramic industry in Hebei Province began in the Southern Song Dynasty and has a history of more than a thousand years. It has developed rapidly after liberation. At present, Hebei Province's ceramic industry has become one of the largest ceramic producing areas in the country in terms of output. In terms of product variety, it has also developed from mainly producing low-grade fine porcelain and coarse ceramics before liberation to being able to produce high-temperature test tubes, crucibles, electroplating tanks, refractory materials, acid-resistant porcelain, low-voltage electrical porcelain, sanitary porcelain, cutting lathes, drilling machine heads, and many other products used by industrial and basic construction departments. Among them, the output of chemical porcelain and sanitary porcelain ranks first in the country. However, under the new situation of rapid development of industrial and agricultural production this year, some ceramic factories do not have a clear understanding of the development direction of the ceramic industry, which has caused production to lag far behind the needs of the great leap forward in production.

    Through extensive airing of views and posting of big-character posters, the meeting criticized empiricism and right-leaning conservative thinking. In the end, everyone realized that not only does the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production require more and more ceramic industrial products, but also many metal equipment and tools can be replaced by ceramic products to save steel and other metal materials. The meeting believes that it is necessary to boldly create new products to serve agricultural production, vigorously develop industrial ceramics, and actively produce chemical industrial equipment; at the same time, it is necessary to increase fine porcelain, maintain and improve the production of coarse ceramics, to meet the needs of urban and rural people's lives and exports; and also to further trial-produce high-grade porcelain to expand the quantity of export porcelain.

    Through the introduction of experience, exhibitions, and on-site visits, the representatives further emancipated their minds and revised their original leap forward plans. The output value of the province's ceramic industry has therefore increased from the original 42 million yuan to more than 54 million yuan, striving to reach more than 60 million yuan. The meeting also decided to successfully trial-produce hundreds of new products, such as high-temperature chemical porcelain, alcohol distillation towers, high-alumina crucibles, hard porcelain, high-voltage electrical porcelain, and ploughshares, in the second half of this year. At the same time, it is necessary to actively research and trial-produce new products that can replace metal materials, and strive to achieve the most advanced level in the world in terms of the quality of various porcelains within the next two years.

    陶瓷业直接为生产服务
    河北决定试制高温化学瓷等新产品
    本报讯　河北省最近召开陶瓷工业跃进会议，确定了全省陶瓷工业的新方向：大力发展直接为工农业生产服务的陶瓷产品。
    河北省陶瓷工业的生产开始于南宋时代，迄今已有一千多年的历史，解放后有了飞速的发展。目前，河北省的陶瓷工业在产量方面已经成为全国最大的陶瓷产区之一，在生产品种方面，也由解放前主要生产低级细瓷和粗陶瓷，发展到能够生产工业和基本建设部门使用的高温试管、坩锅、电镀槽、耐火材料、耐酸瓷、低压电瓷、卫生瓷、切削车刀、钻探机头等许多种产品，其中化学瓷和卫生瓷的产量占全国第一位。但是，在今年工农业生产一日千里的新形势下，有些陶瓷工厂对陶瓷工业的发展方向认识不够明确，因而使生产远远落后于生产大跃进的需要。
    会议通过大鸣大放、贴大字报，批判了经验主义和右倾保守思想。最后，大家认识到：不仅工农业生产大跃进需要愈来愈多的陶瓷工业产品，而且有许多金属设备和工具可以用陶瓷产品来代替，以节省钢铁等金属材料。会议认为，必须大胆创造为农业生产服务的新产品，大力发展工业用瓷，积极生产化学工业设备；同时要增加细瓷，保持和改进粗瓷的生产，以满足城乡人民生活和出口的需要；还要进一步试制高级瓷，以扩大出口瓷的数量。
    通过介绍经验、展览和现场参观，代表们进一步解放了思想，纷纷修订了原来的跃进计划。全省陶瓷工业的产值因此由原来的四千二百多万元增加到五千四百多万元，争取达到六千多万元。会议还决定在今年下半年内，要试制成功高温化学瓷、酒精蒸馏塔、高铝坩锅、硬质瓷、高压电瓷、犁铧等几百种新产品，同时要积极研究试制能够代替金属材料的新产品，并且要争取各种瓷的质量在今明两年内达到世界最先进的水平。　（唐荧）
