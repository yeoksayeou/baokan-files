Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering is Full of Enthusiasm
88.2% of Students Meet Labor and Defense System Standards

(Our Report) Last year, only 42% of the students at the Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering passed the Labor and Defense System standards. After the sports Great Leap Forward conference this year, under the personal leadership of the Party Secretary and President, all students (except those who were ill) participated in Labor and Defense System exercises. On June 10th, the institute proposed to strive for 85% of the students to pass the Labor and Defense System Level 1, and 35% of the students to pass Level 2. All the students were full of confidence and enthusiasm. By June 28th, 88.2% of the students had passed Labor and Defense System Level 1, and 41.9% had passed Level 2.

Now, the institute has issued a challenge to fraternal schools across the country, guaranteeing that everyone goes to the playground, everyone exercises, and by the end of this year, 95% of the students will pass Labor and Defense System Level 1, 60% will pass Level 2, and the number of graded athletes will account for 35% of all students (currently over 8%).
