    Automatic Newspaper Vending Machine
    The Tianjin Equipment Factory of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has trial-produced a coin-operated newspaper vending machine. This vending machine does not require management by personnel. The reader inserts a five-cent coin into the vending machine's slot, turns the handle on the machine, and a newspaper is ejected from the vending machine, while also returning a one-cent coin as change. If a one or two-cent coin or other thin plate is inserted, it will automatically reject it. When all the newspapers inside the vending machine are sold out, the words "Newspapers Sold Out" will appear.

    自动卖报机
    邮电部天津器材厂试制成一部投币式售报机，这部售报机不用人管理，读者将五分钱硬币投入售报机孔内，一转机上的摇把，一份报纸就从售报机中吐出来，同时找回一分硬币。如果投入是一、二分的硬币或其他薄板，它会自动退还拒收，当售报机内的报纸全部售完，会出现“报纸售完”的字样。
