    Light Shining on All of Germany
    By Our Correspondent Liu Guiliang
    Comrade Roland, a man with forty years of Party membership, told the reporter with boundless excitement and pride: "Our family has contributed everything to the cause of communism. My mother has been a Party member for sixty years, and she is now eighty-two years old and still working for peace. Last year she went to Berlin to attend the peace representatives' conference. I am a worker at the railway repair factory in Gela, and I have been a Party member for forty years. I participated in the city-wide workers' struggle against Hitler. Many of our good comrades sacrificed themselves in Hitler's hands, but their blood was not shed in vain. Look, the representatives from more than forty countries around the world sitting on the podium are enough to show our country's international status and that our struggle has the support of people all over the world. Now the Party Central Committee has pointed out the path to the complete victory of socialism for us, and we have the confidence and strength to achieve this goal and plan. Did you see the new train locomotive displayed in front of the venue? It was made by the Youth League members of our factory through voluntary labor and dedicated to the congress. To welcome the Party's Fifth National Congress, the Youth League members of the railway factory created 1.27 million marks worth of value for the country through voluntary labor. This locomotive has many important improvements compared to the same type of locomotive: it pulls more and runs faster. The growth of the younger generation has brought new strength to our country's development."
    Yes, the joy of this veteran comrade who has experienced countless struggles is shared by everyone who participated in the Fifth National Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. As Comrade Ulbricht pointed out in his report, today, even the most vicious enemies cannot deny the prosperity of the German Democratic Republic. In the press box opposite the podium sat dozens of reporters from the West. Among them were reporters from more than a dozen major newspapers and news agencies in West Germany. Aren't their bosses the very people who vainly refuse to recognize the existence of the German Democratic Republic and want to unify Germany by force? However, they could not but scramble to send their reporters to cover the news of this congress. Before their eyes, an increasingly strong German Democratic Republic, against their wishes, is taking a decisive step towards the complete victory of socialism.
    The facts are just like this:
    The industrial output value of the German Democratic Republic has risen to 88.7% in the proportion of the national economy. The Second Five-Year Plan will be overfulfilled, with an increase of 6 billion marks more than the original plan. By the time the Third Five-Year Plan is completed, industrial production will double that of 1957.
    In agriculture, good news of the socialist transformation of agriculture has been reported. In 1957, 8,052 households participated in agricultural cooperatives, while in the first half of 1958, 18,000 households had joined. The upsurge of agricultural collectivization will inevitably bring a new upsurge of production. The task put forward by the Party Central Committee, to achieve self-sufficiency in all livestock products and to exceed West Germany's yield per unit area in the near future, has a greater guarantee.
    In science and technology, the completion of the first atomic reactor, the manufacture of the first jet airliner, the design of high-power machine tools, etc., have all made the German Democratic Republic shine in this field.
    It is on the basis of all these achievements that the Party's Fifth Congress issued a heroic call to the whole country: to exceed the average consumption level of West Germany per capita in terms of daily necessities and consumer goods in a few years. If we take into account that the original economic foundation of East Germany was far behind West Germany, we will understand the significance of this call. This is a happy event for the German people and news that the imperialists are afraid of.
    The German people yearn for peace and the unification of the country, and the government of the German Democratic Republic has made a series of proposals for this. However, the Western countries headed by US imperialism and the Bonn government are doing their best to obstruct the unification of Germany. Until now, they are still using the German question as an excuse to delay the summit meeting, dreaming of annexing the German Democratic Republic by force and turning Germany into a new source of war. However, no matter how the subjective wishes of the imperialist elements are, the German Democratic Republic is increasingly radiating the light of socialist happiness to the entire German people. What the socialist German Democratic Republic has brought to the people, and what the West German Bonn militarist government has brought to the West German people, the German people will ultimately make their own choice between peace and war, between socialist construction and prosperity, and the imperialist policy of atomic death. Thousands upon thousands of people like Comrade Roland and his mother will, under the leadership of the Party, deeply attract and unite all patriotic and progressive forces in West Germany with the irrefutable facts of socialist superiority and achieve the victory of the people.

### 射向全德的光芒

    射向全德的光芒
    本报记者　刘桂梁
    一位有四十年党龄的罗兰得同志，以无限兴奋和骄傲的心情对记者说：“我们一家人为共产主义事业贡献出了一切。我的母亲已有六十年的党龄，现在她八十二岁了，还在为和平而工作。去年她曾到柏林参加了和平代表的会议。我是盖拉城铁路修理工厂的工人，入党已经四十年，参加过全城工人反对希特勒的斗争。我们许多好同志都牺牲在希特勒手里，可是他们的血没有白流。你看，主席台上坐着来自全世界的四十多个国家的代表，就足以说明我们的国家所享有的国际地位，说明我们的斗争有全世界人民的支持。现在党中央又给我们指出了走向社会主义完全胜利的道路，我们有信心和力量来实现这个目标和计划。你看到会场前面陈列的一辆新火车机车没有？那是我们工厂的青年团员用义务劳动制造出来，献给大会的。为了迎接党的第五次全国代表大会，铁路工厂的青年团员，用义务劳动为国家创造了一百二十七万马克的价值。这一辆机车比起同一型的机车来，有许多重要的改进：拉得多，跑得快。青年一代的成长给我们国家的发展带来了新的力量。”
    是的，这位经历过无数次斗争的老同志的喜悦，是每一个参加了德国统一社会党第五次全国代表大会的人所共享的。正像乌布利希同志在报告中所指出的，今天，连最凶恶的敌人也不能不承认德意志民主共和国的繁荣。在主席台对面的记者席上，坐着来自西方的几十个记者。其中就有西德十几家主要报纸和通讯社的记者。他们的老板不正是那些妄想不承认有德意志民主共和国的存在，而想用实力来统一德国的人吗？然而他们却不能不争着把自己的记者派来，采访这个大会的消息。在他们眼前，一个日益坚强的德意志民主共和国，违反他们的愿望，正迈出社会主义完全胜利的决定性的一步。
    事实就是这样的：
    民主德国的工业产值，在国民经济的比重中，已经上升到88.7％。第二个五年计划将会超额完成，并比原计划指标增产六十亿马克。到第三个五年计划完成的时候，工业生产将比1957年又增加一倍。
    在农业方面，已经传来了农业社会主义改造的喜讯。如果在1957年，参加农业合作社的有八千零五十二户，而在1958年的半年里，已有一万八千户入社了。农业合作化的高潮必然会带来新的生产高潮。党中央所提出的任务，即在不久的将来要达到全部畜产品自给和单位面积产量超过西德，有了更大的保证。
    在科学和技术方面，第一座原子反应堆的建成，第一架喷气客机的制成，高功率的工作母机的设计等等，都使民主德国在这一方面放出了异采。
    就是在这一切成就的基础上，党的第五次代表大会向全国发出了豪迈的号召：要在几年里，在日用必需品和消费品方面，按人口平均超过西德的平均消费水平。如果考虑到东德原有的经济基础是远远落后于西德的话，就会懂得这一号召的意义。这是德国人民的喜事，是帝国主义者所害怕的新闻。
    德国人民渴望和平，渴望国家的统一，并且德意志民主共和国政府曾为此提出了一系列的建议。可是以美帝国主义为首的西方国家和波恩政府，却竭尽全力阻挠德国的统一。直到现在，还把德国问题作为拖延最高级会议的一个借口，梦想用实力吞并民主德国，把德国变成新的战争祸源。但是，不管帝国主义分子们的主观愿望怎样，德意志民主共和国正在日益强烈地向全德人民放射出社会主义幸福的光芒。社会主义的德意志民主共和国给人民带来了什么，西德波恩军国主义政府又给西德人民带来了什么，在和平同战争、在社会主义建设和繁荣同帝国主义的原子死亡政策两者之间，德国人民终将会作出自己的选择。成千成万像罗兰得同志和他的母亲这样的人们，将会在党的领导下，以社会主义优越性的颠扑不破的事实，深深地吸引和团结西德一切爱国的进步的力量，取得人民的胜利。
