For thousands of years, Chinese construction workers have been partners with the carrying pole. Cumbersome manual labor has been the traditional construction method in our country. Now, the revolution has begun. Construction companies in more than twenty provinces and cities have, in a matter of days or a little over ten days, achieved vehicle-based ground transportation and mechanized vertical transportation. The broad masses of construction workers have managed to "lay down the carrying pole and liberate their shoulders." This is the prelude to the technological revolution in the construction industry, the beginning of Chinese construction workers freeing themselves from heavy physical labor, and a sign of the great leap forward in the productivity of construction enterprises. It has opened up a path for the rapid realization of mechanized construction.

Mechanization of construction is one of the components of China's technological revolution. It is both an objective requirement of socialist construction and a long-held aspiration of construction workers. Not long ago, some people treated certain superficial and temporary phenomena as the essence, believing that China has a large population and an excess of labor, so the construction industry does not need much mechanization. However, the facts are just the opposite. Under the situation of this year's Great Leap Forward, the amount of construction work in various places has increased several times or even dozens of times, and it is impossible to complete the tasks by relying solely on manual operations. Because labor is very tight in both the industrial and agricultural sectors, the number of construction workers is also difficult to increase substantially. Moreover, with the overall leap forward in the national economy, construction tasks will continue to grow in the future, and labor shortages will not be a temporary phenomenon. Therefore, accelerating construction mechanization has become an increasingly urgent task. And those skeptics and pessimists have gone bankrupt.

The question now is how to achieve mechanized construction. Some people believe that to achieve mechanization, one must ask the state for money to buy machines. Of course, buying some machines appropriately is necessary, and mechanization definitely requires machines, especially for major projects. However, buying machines is not the only way. And under the current circumstances, it is difficult to accelerate the pace of construction mechanization by relying solely on this method.

There is another way. In mid-June, the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the National Committee of the China Construction Trade Union held an on-site conference on technological innovation in Shanghai, planning another route to achieve mechanized construction—to complete the technological revolution in the construction industry. That is: rely on the masses, be self-reliant, eliminate shoulder-carrying within two months; adopt improved tools completely within six months; actively prepare conditions and move towards mechanized construction and industrialized building. The fact that construction workers in more than twenty provinces and cities "laid down their carrying poles" in a month proves that this plan points out the correct path for the technological revolution in the construction industry. Advancing in accordance with the spirit of this plan can accelerate the realization of mechanized construction.

This plan proceeds from reality, combines revolutionary enthusiasm with a pragmatic spirit, and also embodies the objective law of the development of things from simple to complex and from low to high. Some people, disregarding specific times, places, and conditions, attempt to "reach the sky in one step" and use modern machines directly, but they cannot succeed in the face of reality and have no choice but to wait for the arrival of mechanization conditions. As a result, the carrying pole used for thousands of years is still pressing on the shoulders of the workers, and production efficiency still cannot be improved rapidly. Taking the approach of first laying down the carrying pole, first using improved tools, and first using "indigenous" machinery to replace heavy physical labor is within the reach of all construction enterprises. Now, construction companies in more than twenty provinces and cities, relying on their own strength, using ordinary materials and simple equipment, spending very little money, and rapidly manufacturing a batch of simple tools and machines, have increased transportation efficiency by several tenths or several times in a short period of time, powerfully promoting the great leap forward in production and construction. Doesn't this conform to the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical?

This plan emphasizes relying on the masses, self-reliance, and implementing the mass line in work methods. Those who only want to ask the state for money to buy machines can only pin their hopes on the machinery industry sector, or even factories abroad, and rarely pay attention to mobilizing construction workers to create their own tools and machines. In this way, the wisdom of the working masses in innovating technology is difficult to exert, and backward operating methods cannot be changed quickly. This time, the on-site conference on technological innovation in the Shanghai construction industry proposed to millions of construction workers across the country: we want everyone to make tools and machines and eliminate heavy physical labor with their own hands. As a result, heroes have a "place to use their abilities," and they are truly energetic and have many ingenious ideas. The infinite creative wisdom of the masses has been unearthed, forming a surging tide of innovative technology. The transportation landscape of the construction industry has quickly been renewed, and a large number of improved tools have also appeared in other types of work.

Of course, "laying down the carrying pole" and using improved tools is not the fundamental goal of the technological revolution in the construction industry. The fundamental goal is to achieve mechanized construction and industrialized building. Therefore, enterprises that have already "laid down the carrying pole" must not be satisfied with this and must not stop moving forward. Instead, they should continue to advance towards the goal of mechanization like Beijing.

How to further advance towards mechanization? It is still "relying on the masses and being self-reliant."

Specifically, "relying on the masses and being self-reliant" includes the following: First, relying on the masses to create and invent. In the previous stage, there have been significant achievements in this regard, especially in breaking superstitions and encouraging the creative courage of the staff and workers. On this basis, we should continue to encourage staff and workers to boldly create and improve tools and various machines. However, with the creations and inventions of the masses, or the imitation of foreign products, factories are still needed to mass-produce machinery and equipment. Therefore, second, construction enterprises must run their own construction machinery factories and manufacture their own machinery. Third, construction departments in various provinces and the Ministry of Construction Engineering should also run some large and medium-sized construction machinery manufacturing plants.

Now, construction enterprises in Beijing and other places are building factories and making their own machinery on a large scale. They are turning repair shops and repair workshops into machinery manufacturing plants, and at the same time, they are vigorously running small on-site factories, striving to create and manufacture general construction machinery themselves. They also run some sideline businesses related to their own business, such as building blast furnaces, small converters, and smelting iron and steel, and building cement plants to produce building materials. This can both support machinery manufacturing work and improve the supply of building materials. In the process of running factories, they also adopt a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, striving to make the factories more numerous, faster, better, and more economical. These are all correct practices and are worthy of widespread promotion.

The first battle of the technological revolution in the construction industry has been won quickly. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of construction workers for technological innovation has been greatly encouraged by this victory. As long as the leaders of each construction enterprise subjectively want to accelerate the pace of construction mechanization, take advantage of the victory to advance, and continue to mobilize the masses to constantly charge towards backward technology in accordance with the principle of "relying on the masses and being self-reliant," then the construction industry can not only "throw away the carrying pole of a thousand years at once," but also complete the historical task of the technological revolution at an early date. As long as we actively give play to our subjective initiative and implement the mass line, it is entirely possible for construction companies across the country to basically achieve mechanized construction in two or three years or even less.

### 加速建筑施工机械化

    加速建筑施工机械化
    千百年来，我国的建筑工人都是与扁担为伍。笨重的手工劳动，是我国传统的建筑施工的方法。现在，革命开始了，二十几个省、市的建筑公司，分别用几天、十几天的时间，就实现了地面运输车子化、垂直运输机械化；广大建筑工人做到了“放下扁担，解放两肩”。这是建筑业技术革命的序幕，是我国建筑工人摆脱繁重的体力劳动的开始，是建筑企业生产力大跃进的标志。它为迅速实现施工机械化开辟了道路。
    建筑施工机械化，是我国技术革命的组成部分之一。它既是社会主义建设的客观要求，又是建筑工人多年的愿望。不久以前，曾经有一些人把一些表面的、暂时的现象当作本质，认为中国人口多，劳动力过多，因此建筑业不需要什么机械化。可是事实却相反，在今年大跃进的形势下，各地建筑工程量都增加了几倍、十几倍，仅仅依靠手工操作已经无法完成任务；由于工业和农业部门劳动力都很紧张，建筑工人的数量也难以大量增加。而且随着国民经济的全面跃进，今后建筑任务还将不断增长，劳动力紧张也不会是暂时的现象。因此，加速建筑机械化就成为越来越迫切的课题了。而那些怀疑论、悲观论者也就破产了。
    现在的问题是如何实现建筑施工机械化。有些人认为：要机械化，就得向国家要钱买机器。当然，适当买一些机器是必要的，机械化一定需要机器。特别重大工程更是如此。然而买机器却不是唯一的办法。而在目前的情况下，仅仅依靠这一种办法，就很难加速施工机械化的速度。
    还有另外一种办法。6月中旬，建筑工程部和中国建筑工会全国委员会在上海召开技术革新现场会议，规划了实现建筑施工机械化——完成建筑业技术革命的另外一条路线。这就是：依靠群众，自力更生，两个月消灭肩挑人抬现象；半年内全部采用改良工具；积极准备条件，向施工机械化、建筑工业化迈进。一个月的时间，二十多个省、市的建筑工人“放下扁担”的事实，证明这一规划指出了建筑业技术革命的正确道路，按照这一规划的精神前进，就可以加速实现建筑施工机械化。
    这一规划从实际出发，把革命的热情和务实的精神结合起来，同时体现了由简到繁、由低级到高级这一事物发展的客观规律。一些不顾具体的时间、地点和条件，企图“一步登天”全部直接使用现代化机器的人，在现实面前行不通，反过来只好坐等机械化条件的到来。结果千年沿用的扁担杠棒仍然压在工人肩头，生产效率仍然不能迅速提高。采取先放扁担、先用改良工具，先用“土”机械代替笨重体力劳动的作法，却是所有建筑企业都力所能及的。现在，二十多个省、市的建筑公司依靠自己的力量，利用普通的材料、简单的设备，花很少的钱，迅速制造出一批简便的工具、机械，在短短的时间内就把运输效率提高了几成、几倍，有力地促进了生产建设大跃进。这不正符合多快好省的要求吗？
    这一规划强调了依靠群众，自力更生，贯彻了群众路线的工作方法。只想向国家要钱买机器的人，只能把希望寄托在机械工业部门，甚至国外的工厂，很少注意发动建筑工人自己创制工具、机械。这样，工人群众在革新技术方面的智慧就难以发挥，落后的操作方法也就不能很快改变。这次，上海的建筑业技术革新现场会议向全国百万建筑工人提出：我们要大家动手制造工具、机械，用自己的双手消除笨重的体力劳动。这样一来，英雄们有了“用武之地”，真个是干劲冲天，巧计百出。群众无穷的创造智慧被发掘出来，形成汹涌澎湃的革新技术的浪潮。建筑业运输面貌很快就焕然一新，其他工种也出现了大批改良工具。
    当然，“放下扁担”，使用改良工具，并不是建筑业技术革命的根本目标，根本目标是要实现施工机械化和建筑工业化。因此，已经“放下扁担”的企业，绝不能以此为满足，不能停止不前，而是应该像北京市那样继续向机械化的目标进军。
    怎样进一步向机械化进军呢？还是“依靠群众，自力更生”。
    所谓“依靠群众，自力更生”，具体说来有以下几项内容：第一、依靠群众，创造发明。前一阶段，这方面已有显著成绩，特别是打破了迷信，鼓舞了职工群众的创造勇气。在这一基础上，应该继续鼓励职工大胆创造改良工具和各种机械。但是，有了群众的创造发明，或国外产品的仿制，还需要有工厂来大量制造机器设备，因此，第二、建筑企业要自己办建筑机械工厂，自己造机械。第三、各省建筑部门和建筑工程部也应该办一些大中型建筑机械制造厂。
    现在，北京等地的建筑企业已经在大办工厂、自制机械了。他们把修配厂、修理车间改为机械制造厂，同时大力举办工地型的小工厂，争取一般建筑机械自创自制。他们还举办一些与本身业务有关的副业，如建设高炉、小转炉，炼铁炼钢，建设水泥厂等生产建筑材料。这样既可以支援机械制造工作，又可以改善建筑材料供应状况。在办厂的过程中，他们还采取土洋并举的办法，争取把工厂办得又多又快又好又省。这些都是些正确的作法，值得广泛推广。
    建筑业技术革命的第一个战役已经迅速取得胜利。广大建筑工人革新技术的热情都为这一胜利鼓舞得十分高昂。只要各个建筑企业的领导人员主观上想加快建筑机械化的速度，乘胜进军，继续按照“依靠群众，自力更生”的方针，发动群众不断向落后的技术冲锋，那末，建筑业就不但可以“千年扁担一旦抛”，而且可以早日完成技术革命的历史任务。只要积极发挥我们的主观能动性，贯彻群众路线，全国建筑公司在两三年甚至更短的时间内，基本上实现建筑施工机械化是完全可能的。
