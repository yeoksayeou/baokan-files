Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 9th: The situation of the great leap forward in national industry and agriculture has caused Shanghai's industrial production and capital construction to appear at a higher speed than any period in the past. In the first half of this year, the city's total industrial output value increased by 23% compared with the same period last year, completing 43% of the original leap forward plan for the whole year. In the second quarter in particular, the industrial output value increased by nearly 40% compared with the same period last year, and the investment in capital construction in the first half of the year was equal to ten months of last year.

The fact that Shanghai's production and construction speed has increased in the past six months shows that continuing to give full play to the production potential of existing industrial bases and appropriately strengthening their construction is an important condition for ensuring that all parts of the country truly develop production and construction in a faster, better, and more economical way during the second five-year plan.

The most prominent growth in Shanghai's industrial production in the first half of this year was the machinery manufacturing industry. The output value of the Mechanical and Electrical Industry Bureau system alone increased by about 70% compared with the same period last year. In order to enable all regions to obtain equipment for steel smelting and machine manufacturing more quickly and in greater quantities, the mechanical manufacturing forces of the Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical Industry System and non-Mechanical and Electrical Industry Systems were fully mobilized in June to form a strong mechanical manufacturing force. It is estimated that the output of machine tools in the second half of the year will increase by about two times compared with the first half of the year, of which the newly added 5,000 machine tools can supply more than 170 small and medium-sized general machinery factories in various regions. The output value of raw material industries such as steel and chemical industry also increased by more than 30% compared with the same period last year in the first half of this year.

The fact that Shanghai, as an industrial base, can further play its "old hen" role in the current national great leap forward in production and construction is the result of continuous reorganization and improvement of the industrial structure in the past few years. This reorganization and improvement are first reflected in vigorously mastering advanced technologies and improving manufacturing technology levels. In the past six months, many new products and technologies, which are symbols of the world's advanced technology level, have emerged in large quantities in Shanghai. The iron and steel industry has successfully trial-produced more than 40 kinds of high-grade alloy steel and high-quality steel in half a year, the chemical industry has nearly a thousand new products, and more than 100 important products and many new technologies in the light industry and textile industry have reached the international advanced level.

The development of the creative wisdom of the working class in Shanghai is a decisive factor in the high-speed development of Shanghai's industrial production and capital construction this year. After the rectification campaign, the double-anti movement and the education of the general line, the workers and staff masses have broken superstitions and put forward more than 220,000 suggestions for technological innovation in half a year, exceeding three times the total number for the whole year of last year. The production levels that many factories originally planned to reach in 1962 and the new products that were originally planned to be successfully trial-produced in a few years have now been realized in a few months or days. Among these inventions, ordinary workers and technicians generally account for 80% to 90%.

    上海工业生产高速度发展
    今年上半年比去年同期增长23％
    据新华社上海9日电  全国工农业大跃进的形势，使上海的工业生产和基本建设出现了超过过去任何时期的高速度。今年上半年，全市工业产值比去年同期增长23％，完成了全年原定跃进计划的43％。特别是第二季度，工业产值比去年同期增长将近40％，上半年基本建设的投资等于去年的十个月。
    上海这半年来生产建设速度增长的事实表明：继续充分发挥现有工业基地的生产潜力并适当地加强它的建设，是保证全国各地在第二个五年计划期间真正多快好省地发展生产建设的一个重要条件。
    上海今年上半年工业生产中增长得最突出的是机械制造工业。仅机电工业局系统，上半年的产值就比去年同期增长70％左右。为了使各地更多更快地得到钢铁冶炼和机器制造等方面的设备，上海机电工业系统和非机电工业系统的机械制造力量，6月份开始全部动员起来，组成一支强大的机械制造力量。预计下半年机床的产量，还要比上半年增加两倍左右，其中单新近增加的五千台机床就可以供各地建立一百七十多个中小型通用机械厂。钢铁、化学等原材料工业，今年上半年的产值也比去年同期增长了30％以上。
    上海这个工业基地能够在当前全国生产建设大跃进中进一步发挥它的“老母鸡”作用，是过去几年中工业构成不断改组和提高的结果。这种改组和提高，首先表现在大力掌握先进技术、提高制造技术水平上面。半年来，作为世界先进技术水平标志的许多新产品、新技术，已在上海大量涌现出来。钢铁工业半年内试制成功了四十多种高级合金钢和优质钢，化学工业的新产品有近千种之多，轻工业和纺织工业也有一百多种重要的产品和许多新技术达到了国际先进水平。
    上海工人阶级创造智慧的发扬，是上海工业生产和基本建设今年出现高速度发展的一个决定性的因素。经过整风、双反运动和总路线的教育，职工群众大破迷信，半年内提出了二十二万多件革新技术的建议，超过了去年全年总数的三倍。有许多工厂原来规划要在1962年才能达到的生产水平和本来打算几年后才能试制成功的新产品，现在几个月、几天就实现了。在这些创造发明中，普通工人、技术员一般占到了80％到90％。
