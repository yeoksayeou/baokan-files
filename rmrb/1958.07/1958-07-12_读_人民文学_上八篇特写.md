Reading Eight Feature Articles in "People's Literature"
Zhu Qing

As a long-time reader of "People's Literature," I am quite satisfied with the July issue. This satisfaction is actually inseparable from the impression "People's Literature" has given me in recent issues. Starting from January this year, "People's Literature" has been changing its face more and more clearly. That is, reversing the fallacies of so-called "exposing the dark side of life" and "interfering with life" promoted by revisionists in the past. Now, there are more works that enthusiastically praise the Party, praise socialist construction, and praise the heroic figures emerging from the masses; reversing the past revisionists' aversion and resistance to the so-called "cooperating with political tasks." Now, there are more works that quickly reflect reality, reflect the Great Leap Forward in production, and reflect the lives and struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers; reversing the past revisionists' contempt for popularization of literature and art and mass creation. Now, there are more works created by the working people themselves, which are popular with the masses. This fundamental change is more prominent in this issue.

This issue publishes many distinctive works, such as five short and refined short stories, the excellent Hunan Flower Drum Opera "War Drums Urge Spring," four unique essays, Guo Moruo's historically valuable memoirs of the War of Resistance Against Japan – "Hong Bo Qu," etc., all of which are worth reading, but here I only plan to talk about the several feature articles published in this issue.

It can be seen that feature articles occupy a considerable proportion in this journal. These feature articles have their own characteristics in terms of subject matter, presentation techniques, and style, but they also have a common feature, that is, they vividly express the face of the current magnificent socialist Great Leap Forward from different aspects. Zhong Ling is a familiar cartoonist. In his essay-poem style feature "Glory! The Ming Tombs Reservoir," he enthusiastically depicts the moving scenes of our beloved Chairman Mao and the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee participating in voluntary labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site. Here, we not only see vivid pictures, but also seem to hear the enthusiastic cheers of all the laborers of the Ming Tombs to the leaders. The poet Guo Xiaochuan's "Steel Youth Shock Brigade" praises a group of ordinary laborers on the construction site of the Ming Tombs Reservoir. The poet's feature article is relatively long, in contrast to the painter's short chapters, it introduces a labor shock brigade in detail. The poet is speaking to young friends in the feature article, but can his not-so-young friends not be moved by this narrative poem?

We have seen people "fighting" in Beijing, on land, and in the feature "Labor" written by a sailor comrade, we saw people "fighting" in the south, on the water. This is the battle to strive for progress and build socialism, the battle to catch up with Britain and destroy the prestige of the imperialists! What is written here is the technical competition between our small 2,000-ton oil tanker and a "gorgeous and dazzling" British giant ship, and the winning side belongs to our small oil tanker. "Old brother! It looks scary on the outside, but it's actually a broken horse-drawn carriage," is a sailor's evaluation of the British giant ship. It is precisely with this fearless proletarian spirit and their soaring enthusiasm that our sailors have made the British gentlemen admit defeat. The feature article is full of patriotic passion.

"Record of Li Shimei," "Newcomers in the Scientific Ranks," and "The Story of Underground Sewers" are three feature articles about heroic figures on the technical revolution front, Lu Ban and Zhuge Liang among the working people. "Record of Li Shimei" and "Newcomers in the Scientific Ranks" both introduce Li Shimei, the nationally famous "termite expert," and He Ting, a peasant who invented a hand-cranked automatic bulldozer, with political-style enthusiasm. Several feature articles all mention technical issues, but what is valuable is that they all focus on praising the noble communist style of these "folk experts" who dare to think, dare to act, and are indomitable through technical details.

The after-school performance team of the Sichuan Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Rehabilitation Institute recently contributed their wonderful artistic programs to the people of the capital. The impression left by this performance was so profound; the soldiers' bodies were disabled, but their proletarian soldiers' unwavering spirit stood tall, shining brightly in the arts. The feature article "Can" profoundly expresses this theme.

"Catching Up with Tianqiao" written by the young author Lin Jinlan is a feature article reflecting the Great Leap Forward of commercial workers. The feature article writes about one of the "miracles" that appeared in the Great Leap Forward: backward elements becoming advanced figures; the matter is relatively simple, but it is written quite vividly, with both plot and characters, vividly, reading like a novel.

We have read only eight feature articles, but we can see how rich and exciting life scenes are in them! Some of these feature articles may be written relatively crudely, and the author's hasty writing can be seen, but how much educational significance do those deeds and those characters have for us! It is obvious that this ability to quickly express the hot and happening events in life is unique to the feature article as a literary style. We can't help but say: Let our newspapers and periodicals publish more and better feature articles! Gathering thousands and tens of thousands of such feature articles, isn't it a magnificent history of our construction of socialism today?

### 读“人民文学”上八篇特写

    读“人民文学”上八篇特写
    朱清
    作为“人民文学”一个长期读者，我对7月号这一期刊物是感到相当满意。这种满意的心情实际上是和最近几期“人民文学”给我的印象分不开的。从今年1月说起，“人民文学”愈来愈鲜明地改变着面貌。那就是，一反过去修正主义者宣扬的所谓“揭露生活阴暗面”、“干预生活”的谬论。现在，热情歌颂党、歌颂社会主义建设、歌颂群众中涌现的英雄人物的作品多起来了；一反过去修正主义者对所谓“配合政治任务”的厌恶和抗拒。现在，迅速反映现实，反映生产大跃进，反映工农兵群众的生活和斗争的作品多起来了；一反过去修正主义者对文艺普及工作和群众创作的轻视。现在，由劳动人民亲自创作，为群众喜闻乐见的作品多起来了。这个根本变化，在这一期里表现得更突出一些。
    这一期发表了不少很有特色的作品，如五篇短小精练的短篇小说、优秀的湖南花鼓戏“战鼓催春”、四篇别具风格的散文、郭沫若同志的具有历史价值的抗战回忆录——“洪波曲”等等，都值得一读，不过这里我只准备谈谈这一期发表的几篇特写。
    能够看得出来，在这一期刊物里特写是占着相当大的比重的。这些特写，在题材、表现手法和风格方面是各有特点的，但是它们也有一个共同的特点，那就是，它们从不同的方面生动地表现了当前波澜壮阔的社会主义大跃进的面貌。锺灵是我们熟悉的漫画家，在他的那篇散文诗式的特写“光荣啊！十三陵水库”里，热情洋溢地描绘了我们敬爱的毛主席和党中央各位首长在十三陵水库工地参加义务劳动的动人的场景。这里，我们不仅看到了生动的画面，同时也仿佛可以听到所有十三陵的劳动者对领袖的热情的欢呼。诗人郭小川写的“钢铁青年突击队”，歌颂的却是十三陵水库工地上一群普通的劳动者。诗人的这篇特写比较长，和画家的短小的篇章恰成一个对照，它细致地介绍了一个劳动突击队。诗人在特写里是面对青年朋友们讲话的，但是难道他的那些并不年青的朋友能不为这篇叙事诗所激动吗？
    我们看到了人们在北京、在陆地上的“战斗”，而在一位海员同志写的特写“劳动号油轮”里，又看到人们在南方、在水上的“战斗”。这是力争上游、建设社会主义的战斗，是赶上英国，灭帝国主义者威风的战斗！这里写的是我们的一艘不过二千吨的小油轮和一艘“华丽耀眼的”英国巨轮在技术上的较量，胜利的一方是属于我们这艘小油轮的。“老阿弟！看起来它的外表够吓人，其实它是辆破马车”，这是一位海员对英国巨轮的评价。我们的海员正是凭了这种大胆蔑视敌人的无产阶级的气魄和他们的冲天干劲使得英国绅士甘拜下风的。特写里面充满着爱国主义的激情。
    “记李始美”、“科学行列里的新人”、“地下水道的故事”这三篇特写写的是技术革命战线上的英雄人物，劳动人民当中的公输般和诸葛亮。“记李始美”和“科学行列里的新人”这两篇特写，都以政论式的热情，分别介绍了全国闻名的“白蚁专家”李始美和发明手摇自动推土机的农民贺亭。几篇特写里都写到了技术问题，但可贵的是它们都透过技术细节，着力歌颂了这些“土专家”敢想敢干、百折不回的崇高的共产主义风格。
    四川革命残废军人教养院课余演出队不久以前向首都人民贡献了他们精采的艺术节目。这次演出给人们留下的印象是如此深刻；战士们的肉体残废了，但他们的无产阶级战士的坚毅精神却屹立不倒，在艺术方面闪放出异彩。“能”这篇特写就深刻地表现了这个主题。
    青年作者林斤澜写的“赶天桥”是一篇反映商业工作者大跃进的特写。特写写的是大跃进当中出现的“奇迹”之一：落后分子变成先进人物；事情是比较简单的，但写得却相当生动，既有情节，又有人物，绘声绘影，读来如同一篇小说。
    我们读过的不过八篇特写，可是在其中可以看到多么丰富、多么激动人心的生活场景啊！这些特写有的容或写得比较粗糙，能够看得出作者匆忙执笔的痕迹，但那些事迹、那些人物对我们该有多大的教育意义！很明显，这种把生活中刚刚发生的热气腾腾的事件迅速表现出来的本领，是特写这种文学样式所独具的。我们不禁要说：让我们的报刊上能发表更多更好的特写吧！把几千几万篇这样的特写汇集起来，不就是我们今天建设社会主义的一部宏伟的历史吗？
