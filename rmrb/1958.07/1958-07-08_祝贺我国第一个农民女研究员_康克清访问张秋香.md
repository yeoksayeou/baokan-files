Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 6th. Kang Keqing, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, visited Zhang Qiuxiang, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model, in Balidian Village, Weinan County, Shaanxi Province on the 2nd to congratulate her on becoming our country's first female peasant researcher.

When Kang Keqing visited Zhang Qiuxiang's high-yield cotton field, it was raining heavily, and they walked along the muddy road to the outside of the village. The cotton nearby was growing well, but Zhang Qiuxiang's high-yield cotton was particularly tender, green, and lush, five or six inches taller than ordinary cotton. Zhang Qiuxiang told the guests: "This high-yield field is a total of 4.3 mu. The original plan was to produce 1,500 jin of seed cotton per mu. After studying the General Line, we increased the yield to 2,600 jin, and now we are preparing to increase it to 3,000 jin." Then she briefly introduced her farming methods and experience. Kang Keqing was very interested in Zhang Qiuxiang's experience in controlling flower buds. She curiously counted the flower buds on a few cotton plants at the edge of the field and found that fifteen or sixteen had already formed. She asked Zhang Qiuxiang: "How many bolls do you plan to have each cotton plant produce this year?" Zhang Qiuxiang said: "Fifty." She asked again: "Are you confident?" Zhang Qiuxiang smiled and said, "Yes." At this time, she parted the dense leaves of the cotton and explained to the guests her method of controlling flower buds: each cotton plant retains seventeen branches, each branch bears two to four cotton bolls, and in addition, ten "reserve" bolls are left on the tips of the branches to compensate for unexpected losses. She also calculated a detailed account: there are currently 4,785 cotton plants per mu, and each plant bears 50 bolls, which can produce more than 230,000 bolls in total, which will produce at least 3,000 jin of seed cotton in the future. Comrade Kang Keqing praised Zhang Qiuxiang's spirit of bold innovation and encouraged her to continue to study culture and delve into science and technology.

    祝贺我国第一个农民女研究员
    康克清访问张秋香
    新华社西安6日电  中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会副主席康克清2日前往陕西省渭南县八里店村，访问全国著名农业劳动模范张秋香，祝贺她成为我国第一个农民女研究员。
    康克清参观张秋香的棉花丰产田的时候，天下着大雨，她们踏着泥泞的道路来到村外。附近的棉花都长得很好，张秋香的丰产棉花却格外嫩绿茂盛，比一般棉花高出五、六寸。张秋香给客人们说：“这块丰产田共四亩三分，原计划每亩产籽棉一千五百斤，学习总路线后，我们把产量提高到两千六，现在还准备提到三千斤。”接着她简单地介绍了她的耕作方法和经验。康克清对张秋香控制花蕾的经验很感兴趣，她好奇地数了数地边几棵棉花的花蕾，发现已结了十五、六个。她问张秋香：“今年你计划让每棵棉花结多少桃子？”张秋香说：“五十个。”她又问：“有把握吗？”张秋香笑着说：“有。”这时，她就拨开棉花的密叶，给客人们讲解她控制花蕾的办法：每棵棉花留十七个枝条，每枝结两个到四个棉桃，此外，在枝头还分别留出十个“预备”桃，以弥补意外的损失。她还算了一笔细账：每亩现有棉花四千七百八十五株，每株结桃五十个，共可结二十三万多个，将来最少可产籽棉三千多斤。康克清同志对张秋香大胆革新的精神表示赞扬，并且勉励她继续学习文化，钻研科学技术。
