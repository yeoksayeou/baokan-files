Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, July 22nd: Pakistani public opinion continues to express support for the struggle of the Middle Eastern people, condemn US-British acts of aggression, and strongly demand that the government change its policy of following the West. According to a report in "The Leader," Pakistani Prime Minister Noon is scheduled to go to London on July 24 to attend the Baghdad Pact Council meeting to be held on July 28. Nine leaders from seven different Pakistani parties, including the Republican Party, the People's League, the National People's Party, and the Muslim League, issued a joint statement in Lahore, demanding that the government adopt a clear policy on the situation in the Middle East. They expressed full support for the struggle of the Middle Eastern people against imperialism.

The Dacca "New World" weekly suggested that the government "should not harbor any other thoughts about the crisis of the Baghdad Pact."

"Today's News" said, "The recent developments in the Middle East have made the bankruptcy of Pakistan's foreign policy an undeniable reality."

"Karachi Times" said today, "We should not look at the Middle East issue from the perspective of Western oil and strategic requirements, but from the perspective of what is beneficial to the region."

The remarks made by Baig, Secretary of the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in support of the United States' armed intervention in Middle Eastern countries have been strongly condemned by public opinion here.

According to reports, Baig said he "fully agreed" with the resolution of the meeting of the heads of the three Muslim member states of Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey in Ankara. Baig also denied any possibility of changing Pakistan's policy towards the Middle East.

"Karachi Times" said: "Not changing one's attitude no matter what is a characteristic of those who refuse to move forward with their times, a characteristic that dominates our rulers and is a source of great danger." The newspaper also said, "We should mainly act according to our own will" and not listen to the commands of Washington and London.

"Struggle News" published an editorial saying, "The Western countries' previous control and influence over the Middle East are gradually disappearing, and this situation is obviously a natural result of the awakening of the Middle East." The newspaper warned the United States that "displaying force and showing military power cannot regain lost interests."

Qayyum Khan, Chairman of the Pakistan Muslim League, condemned the US-British dispatch of troops to invade and occupy Lebanon and Jordan at a public gathering on the 19th, saying, "Now there is no force in the world that can stop the tide of Arab nationalism." "No matter how many cannons the United States has, it cannot maintain the crumbling Chamoun regime in Lebanon."

Qayyum Khan said that the Pakistani government "has placed itself in opposition to the entire Islamic world after pursuing a stupid policy. We are a vagrant among Muslim countries because they know that our policy is determined by Western imperialist interests."

Qayyum Khan also asked Prime Minister Noon to convene a meeting of all parties to formulate Pakistan's foreign policy and discuss the situation in the Middle East.

    在巴格达集团伦敦会议开幕前夕
    巴基斯坦舆论反对政府给侵略者捧场
    要求摆脱美英控制并奉行独立的政策
    据新华社卡拉奇22日电　巴基斯坦舆论继续表示支持中东人民的斗争，谴责美英的侵略行为，并强烈要求政府改变追随西方的政策。据“领袖报”报道，巴基斯坦总理努恩预定在7月24日前往伦敦参加将在7月28日举行的巴格达条约理事会会议。包括共和党、人民联盟、民族人民党和穆斯林联盟在内的巴基斯坦七个不同党派的九个领袖在拉合尔发表了一项联合声明，要求政府对于中东的局势采取一种明确的政策。他们表示全面支持中东人民反对帝国主义的斗争。
    达卡“新世界”周刊建议政府“对巴格达条约的危机不要抱着任何其他的想法”。
    “今天报”说，“中东最近事态的发展已经使巴基斯坦的外交政策的破产成为不能否认的现实”。
    “卡拉奇时报”今天说，“我们不应该从西方石油和战略的要求来看待中东问题，而应该从什么对这个地区有利的这种观点来看待中东问题”。
    巴基斯坦外交部秘书贝格支持美国武装干涉中东国家的言论受到了这里舆论强烈的谴责。
    据各报报道，贝格说他“完全赞成”巴基斯坦、伊朗、土耳其三个穆斯林成员国首脑在安卡拉举行的会议的决议，贝格还否认有改变巴基斯坦对中东的政策的任何可能。
    “卡拉奇时报”说：“不管怎么样都不改变态度是那些拒绝同时代一起前进的人的特点，这一特点在我们的统治者中占着主导的地位，并且是巨大危险的源泉”。这家报纸又说，“我们应当主要按照自己的意志办事”，而不要听从华盛顿和伦敦的指挥。
    “战斗报”发表社论说，“西方国家以前对中东的控制和影响正在逐渐消失，这种局势显然是中东觉醒的自然结果”。这家报纸警告美国说，“显示武力和表现军事力量是不能重新得到已经失去的利益的”。
    巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟主席加尧姆汗19日在一次公众集会上谴责美英派遣军队侵占黎巴嫩和约旦的行为时说，“现在世界上没有任何力量能够制止阿拉伯民族主义的潮流”。“不管美国有多少大炮，都不能维持黎巴嫩的摇摇欲坠的夏蒙政权。”
    加尧姆汗说，巴基斯坦政府“在奉行一个愚蠢的政策以后，已经同整个伊斯兰、世界处于对立的地位。我们是穆斯林国家中的一个流浪汉，因为它们知道我国的政策是由西方帝国主义利益来决定的。”
    加尧姆汗还要求努恩总理召开各党派会议来制订巴基斯坦的外交政策和讨论中东局势。
