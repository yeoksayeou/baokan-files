    Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Lüda Health School Affiliated Hospital
    Develops “Electric Suction Abortion Device”
    (Our newspaper reported) The Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of the Lüda Health School Affiliated Hospital recently successfully trial-produced an "Electric Suction Abortion Device." This innovation has caught up with international standards and made a new contribution to medicine in our country.
    A year ago, Wang Jiaguang, a doctor in this department, proposed experimenting with this method and made a specific plan, but the plan was not realized because people's minds were not liberated. Since deeply studying the General Line, everyone has shed their inferiority complex and established a new atmosphere of daring to think and daring to act. Wang Jiaguang re-proposed this suggestion. With the help of the entire department, he made an "Electric Suction Abortion Device" without spending a penny. After testing and appraisal, this "Electric Suction Abortion Device" has the following advantages: greatly reduces the patient's pain during surgery; reduces the risk of uterine perforation; shortens the operation time; less bleeding during surgery; reduces postoperative sequelae; the method is simple and easy to operate; no special equipment is required. This innovation is not only original in China but has also caught up with international standards.

    旅大卫生学校附属医院妇产科
    制成“电气吸吮流产器”
    本报讯　据旅大日报报道：旅大卫生学校附属医院妇产科，最近试制成功了“电气吸吮流产器”。这一创举，已赶上国际水平，对我国医学作了新的贡献。
    一年前，这个科的医师王家光就提议试验这种方法，并作出了具体计划，但由于人们的思想没有解放，计划没有得到实现。自从深入学习总路线之后，人人打掉自卑感，树立了敢想敢干的新风气，王家光又重新提出这个建议。他在全科人员的帮助下，没花一文钱，制成一个“电气吸吮流产器”。经过试验鉴定，这个“电气吸吮流产器”有以下一些好处：大大减轻患者在手术中的痛苦；减少了子宫穿孔的危险；缩短了手术时间；手术中出血较少；减少了手术后遗症；方法简便，容易操作；不需要特殊设备。这一创举，不仅在国内是独创，还赶上了国际水平。
