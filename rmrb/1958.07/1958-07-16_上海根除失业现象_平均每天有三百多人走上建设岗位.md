Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 15th: Shanghai has provided employment for over 60,000 people this year, with an average of over three hundred people taking up new construction posts every day. Over the nine years since liberation in 1949, Shanghai has provided jobs for 870,000 people, and the unemployment problem left over from old Shanghai has been basically eliminated.

The majority of the 60,000 people employed in Shanghai this year have gone to other areas to support industrial and agricultural construction. Including the workers, technicians, and commercial personnel sent out in previous years, Shanghai has already dispatched 300,000 people to participate in construction in various fields in other regions. Over the past few years, Shanghai has also increased its local employment by more than 500,000 people, with about 85% of them working in industry. Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai has been developing into a modern industrial base for manufacturing high-grade precision products. The required labor force is being mutually adjusted between various departments, and several tens of thousands of workers who originally manufactured ordinary daily necessities and engaged in service work have now been transferred to the production of high-grade products.

Shanghai currently has a total population of over 7,120,000, with about 2,400,000 employed, averaging one out of every three people working. Before liberation, Shanghai was the city with the largest unemployed population in the country. Over 670,000 unemployed people registered with the government after liberation, exceeding one-tenth of the city's total population at the time. In recent years, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanghai government departments have taken many measures to help the unemployed create employment opportunities. An official from the Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau said that under the situation of the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, the six provinces neighboring Shanghai alone have requested tens of thousands of people from Shanghai in the past six months. Although a batch has been supported, it is far from meeting the needs of various regions. The large-scale unemployment of technical workers in capitalist countries stands in sharp contrast to the difficulty in recruiting technical workers here.

Of the unemployed population registered with the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee after liberation, approximately 2.9% have not yet found employment. These unemployed people generally lack skills and education, and are also older, so there is no suitable work for them at the moment. However, these people usually engage in some mobile or seasonal work, and the state provides certain relief, so they are not completely unemployed in essence. In order to further improve the lives of these people, the Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau is currently trying to help them obtain more stable jobs in various ways. In addition, more than 20,000 households of citizens who had difficulty in life and relied on government relief in the past have now formed more than 500 groups under the arrangement of the civil affairs department to engage in various productive and service labor, and basically no longer need government relief. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, because the number of employed people has been increasing year by year, the average monthly social relief fund issued by the government in the first half of this year was only a quarter of that in 1955.

    上海根除失业现象
    平均每天有三百多人走上建设岗位
    新华社上海15日电　上海市今年以来又有六万多人找到工作，平均每天有三百多人走上新的建设岗位。从1949年解放后到现在的九年来，上海市已有八十七万人有了职业，旧上海遗留下来的失业现象已经基本消灭。
    上海市今年就业的六万多人大部分是去外地支援工农业建设的。连同前几年输送出去的工人、技术人员、商业人员在内，上海市已有三十万人在外地参加各方面的建设。上海本地过去几年中也增加了五十多万就业人员，其中工业方面占到85％左右。今年以来，上海正在向制造高级精密产品的现代化工业基地的方向发展，所需要的劳动力正从各部门之间进行互相调剂，目前已经有好几万原来制造普通日用品的和从事服务性工作的工人转为高级产品的生产工人。
    上海全市现有七百一十二万多人，就业人员有二百四十万左右，平均三个人中就有一个人在工作。解放以前，上海是全国失业人口最多的城市，解放后陆续向政府登记的失业人员共计有六十七万多人，超过当时全市人口的十分之一。这几年来，中共上海市委和上海政府部门采取了许多措施，帮助失业人员创造就业条件。上海市劳动局的一位负责人说，在全国工农业生产大跃进的形势下，在这半年内单邻近上海的六个省就向上海要好几万人，目前虽已支援了一批，但还远远不能满足各地的要求。资本主义国家技术工人大批失业同这里招收技术工人感到困难的情况，适成鲜明的对比。
    解放后向上海市人民委员会登记的失业人口中，目前还有大约2.9％的人没有找到职业。这些失业人员一般都没有技术和文化，而且年龄也较大，因此一时没有适当的工作可做，但这些人平时都从事一些流动性或季节性的工作，国家并且给予一定救济，因而他们实质上并不是完全处在失业的情况中。为了使这些人的生活得到进一步改善，上海市劳动局目前正从多方面设法帮助他们获得比较稳定的工作。此外，过去生活有困难依靠政府救济的市民，在民政部门的安排下，现在已经有二万多户组成了五百多个小组，从事各种生产和服务性的劳动，基本上已经不再需要政府的救济。据上海市民政局统计，因为就业人员年年增多，今年上半年政府平均每个月发放的社会救济金仅为1955年的四分之一。
