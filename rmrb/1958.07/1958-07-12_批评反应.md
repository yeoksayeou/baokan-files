    Criticism Response

    The criticism made by Comrade Liang Zhenghan of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Labor in the People's Daily on May 10th, regarding our bureau's untimely and irresponsible handling of letters from the people, is entirely correct, and we sincerely accept it. The backlog of letters from the people in our bureau is indeed very serious, and the time some letters have been backlogged is even longer than the examples cited by Comrade Liang Zhenghan.

    In order to improve this work, we have made the handling of letters from the people an important part of strengthening the mass viewpoint and improving working methods in the rectification movement. We will conduct checks from ideological, political, organizational, and methodological perspectives, formulate concrete improvement measures, and resolutely correct bureaucratic work styles.

    批评反应
    人民日报5月10日发表的北京市劳动局梁正汉同志对我局处理人民来信不及时、不负责任的批评，是完全正确的，我们诚恳接受。我局对人民来信积压情况确是很严重，有的来信积压的时间，甚至比梁正汉同志所举的例子还要久。
    为了改进这一工作，我们已把处理人民来信工作，作为整风运动中加强群众观点、改进工作方法的重要内容之一。从思想上、政治上、组织上和工作方法上加以检查，定出确实改进的办法，坚决纠正官僚主义作风。
