    Who Says Students Can't Surpass Teachers?
    Mei Er
    It is said that when a Party worker at a certain university encouraged students to study hard and surpass their teachers (experts), some students said, "That's impossible!" Some even said, "That's a disregard for teachers (experts) and a lack of respect!" Can students surpass teachers (experts)? Not long ago, the People's Daily reported on page seven such an event: Wu Guoqin and two other students from the Hydraulic Engineering Department of Tsinghua University boldly designed a rockfill overflow dam. Not only has China never had this type of rockfill overflow dam, but it cannot even be found in foreign literature. The television teaching and research group of this university, consisting of Lu Da? and two other young teachers, broke free from blind faith in authority and experts and offered three television courses that China had never had before. Isn't this students surpassing teachers?
    Students surpassing teachers not only exists now, but also existed in the past. For example, Mencius was a student of Zisi, but Mencius's knowledge surpassed that of Zisi, and later generations called him the Second Sage, meaning second only to Confucius. Mencius was not superstitious on this issue; he not only agreed with Yan Yuan's statement, "What kind of person was Shun, and what kind of person am I? Whoever strives can be like him," but also said, "Everyone can become Yao and Shun." As long as one dares to think and act, even great sages and worthies like Yao and Shun can be achieved.
    The working people's understanding of this issue also surpasses that of intellectuals. Among the working people, there are such sayings as: "Immortals are made from ordinary people, only afraid that ordinary people are not dedicated." "There are only top scholar disciples, no top scholar masters."
    The law of the development of things is that the new surpasses the old; it is precisely because of this that society can continuously advance. Although new things are very small when they first appear, even so small that they are not noticed, they are developing and becoming stronger day by day. The old, on the other hand, either have stopped developing and begun to decline, or, although they are still developing, they are very slow compared to the new; and eventually the new will inevitably replace the old. Metabolism is what this means.
    Analyzing specific situations is also the same. Although students have a lack of knowledge and experience, they have another side: they are the most active, the most energetic, the least conservative, and the most willing to learn. They always want to learn more and learn the best. They are like what Chairman Mao said: "A blank sheet of paper, without any burden, is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and good for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures." This is one. Now socialist countries are in an era where one day is equal to decades or hundreds of years. On a global scale, three artificial satellites have gone into space; domestically, one invention follows another, one creation follows another, especially China has entered the atomic energy era, and the first atomic reactor has been built. In such an era, students' knowledge will certainly increase faster than that of teachers. As someone said, what a three-year-old child knows now, in some respects, far surpasses Confucius and Mencius. Now in factories and rural areas, I don't know how many "Zhuge Liangs" there are. This is two. With these two points, how can students not surpass teachers? Even if they have not surpassed them now, they will surpass them in the future. It is normal for students to surpass teachers; it is an abnormal phenomenon for students not to surpass teachers. When there are too many of these abnormal phenomena, it indicates that society is stagnating.
    To say that encouraging students to surpass teachers is to despise teachers and experts is, of course, a ridiculous statement. This is not a question of despising or not despising anyone, but a question of acknowledging or not acknowledging objective truth. We must have a correct assessment of the role of teachers (experts), and we must respect teachers (experts) who have real talent and learning and have made contributions to socialist construction. But it must also be admitted that as long as students study hard, they can surpass teachers (experts). Not only can they surpass ordinary teachers (experts), but they can also surpass great scientists.
    Of course, students must engage in arduous study and arduous work in order to surpass teachers. It is by no means as some people imagine: that innate intelligence plus occasional inspiration, profound and mysterious theories, and endless thinking while sitting in a "study" can make one an expert. Such people will never become experts, and even if they have the opportunity to deceive others into calling them "experts," they will eventually reveal their true colors.

### 谁说学生不能超过先生？

    谁说学生不能超过先生？
    梅耳
    据说：某大学一位党的工作人员鼓励学生努力学习、超过先生（专家）时，就有学生说：“这是不可能的！”甚至还说：“这是对先生（专家）的轻视，不尊重！”学生能不能超过先生（专家）呢？不久前，人民日报七版就报道了这样一件事：清华大学水利系学生吴国钦等三人大胆地设计了一个堆石滚水坝。这种堆石滚水坝不仅中国没有过，连外国文献中也找不到。这个大学的电视教研组陆大?等三位青年教师，破除了对权威、专家的迷信，开出了三门中国从未有过的电视课程。这不是学生超过了先生吗？
    学生超过先生，这不仅现在有，就是过去也有。举个例子：孟子是子思的学生，而孟子的学问就超过了子思，后人就称他为亚圣，意思是孔子的第二。在这个问题上，孟子倒是没有迷信的，他不仅同意颜渊说的：“舜何人也，予何人也，有为者亦若是。”而且还说：“人皆可以为尧舜。”只要敢想敢做，连尧舜这样大圣大贤都可以做到。
    劳动人民对于这个问题的认识，也是超过了知识分子。在劳动人民中就流传着这样一些话：“神仙本是凡人做，只怕凡人心不专。”“只有状元徒弟，没有状元师傅。”
    事物发展的规律，本来就是新的超过旧的；也正是这样，社会才能不断地向前前进。新的东西初次出现时虽然很小，甚至小到不被人注意，但它是发展着的，一天比一天壮大。而旧的则不同，有的已经停止发展，开始衰退，有的虽然还在继续发展，但和新的比较起来，则显得非常缓慢；而且最后必然新的代替旧的。新陈代谢，就是这个意思。
    分析具体情况，也是如此。学生虽然有知识、经验不足的一面，但有另一面，最积极、最有生气、最少保守思想、最肯学习，他们总想学更多的东西，学最好的东西。他们就像毛主席说的：“一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”这是一。现在社会主义国家正处于一天等于几十年几百年的时代，从世界范围来说，三颗人造卫星上了天；从国内来说，一个发明跟着一个发明，一个创造跟着一个创造，特别是中国跨进了原子能时代，第一座原子反应堆已经建成。在这样的时代环境中，学生的知识当然会比先生增长得更快。就如有人说的，现在三岁的孩子知道的东西，在某些方面，远远超过了孔夫子孟夫子。现在工厂、农村中，不知有多少“诸葛亮”，这是二。有此两点，学生怎么能不超过先生呢？即使现在还没有超过，将来也会超过。学生超过先生是正常的现象，学生不超过先生，是一种反常的现象。这种反常现象多了，就表明社会是在停止不前。
    说鼓励学生超过先生，是轻视先生轻视专家，这当然是很可笑的说法。这不是轻视谁不轻视谁的问题，而是承认不承认客观真理的问题。对先生（专家）的作用，我们要有正确的估计，对有真才实学，并在社会主义建设中已作出贡献的先生（专家），我们要尊重。但是也必须承认，只要学生努力学习是可以超过先生（专家）的。不仅可以超过一般的先生（专家），而且可以超过伟大的科学家。
    当然，学生要超过先生，一定要作艰苦的学习和艰苦的工作。决不像某些人所想像的：天生的聪明加上偶然的灵感、深奥神秘的理论、坐在“书斋”里不停的思考，就可以成为专家。这种人是永远成不了专家的，即使有机会骗得了“专家”的称号，终有一天要露出原形来。
