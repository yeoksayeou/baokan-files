    Give Full Play to the Wisdom and Talents of the Workers and Masses
    Andong Small Repair Shop Mass-Produces Tractors
    (Our newspaper, Andong, 4th dispatch) Reporter Lu Man reports: The workers of the local state-owned Andong Machinery Factory, developing a spirit of originality, overcame the heavy difficulties of technology, equipment, and raw materials, unafraid of the ridicule of others, and broke the mysterious view of running heavy industry, successfully trial-produced the "Yalu River No. 1" tractor.
    The "Yalu River No. 1" tractor manufactured by this factory is now on display at the National Agricultural Implements Exhibition in the capital. It has been welcomed by the audience. In addition to producing this type of tractor, this factory is also trial-producing another more sophisticated new model of a forty-horsepower tractor, as well as a large number of gas generators and various new agricultural implements.
    The Andong Machinery Factory was established from scratch in 1952 during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. At first, it was just a small repair shop. They found a few civilian houses and installed four belt-driven lathes with worn gears. Among the more than 30 workers in the factory, not even one was a trainee technician. Under the factory's policy of "relying on the Party, relying on the old workers, and serving the countryside," they trial-produced many new products.
    During the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization in 1956, the Municipal Bureau of Industry asked them to trial-produce a machine that "plows the fields without cattle" to support agricultural production. At that time, the factory had neither a tractor to imitate nor technical data, making it really difficult to build a tractor. Leading cadres organized a "New Product Trial Production Group" with veteran workers as the backbone. On the one hand, they groped around and worked hard, and on the other hand, they searched through publications, checked data, and sent people out to find objects for surveying and mapping. Taking Hungarian tractors as a blueprint, and combining the factory's equipment and technical conditions, they decided to trial-produce a single-cylinder tire-type tractor. In the process of trial production, the workers gave full play to their intelligence and ingenuity, devised various methods to overcome the difficulties of not having equipment and instruments, and solved technical problems. When they did not have materials, they looked for them in scrap iron piles. At the same time, with the support and help of the Party and comrades in the trial production group, they broke through ideological obstacles, withstood the cold wind of sarcasm, and after more than a year of hard work, a "native tractor" was born in February 1957. But at that time, it did not receive attention until the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward this spring, when it aroused attention.
    The "Yalu River No. 1" is a thirty-horsepower single-cylinder tire-type tractor. After plowing field trials, it proved to be simple in structure, easy to operate, and deep in plowing, capable of driving three-share or four-share plows, and can plow more than 60 mu (approximately 10 acres) per shift (ten hours); it is not prone to accidents, and if accidents occur, it is easy to repair; it can be manufactured with ordinary steel and pig iron. In addition to plowing, it can also be used as power for transportation, rice milling, power generation, and irrigation and drainage; it can use not only diesel, but also heavy diesel and crude oil.
    Recently, in the technical revolution movement at the Andong Machinery Factory, a large number of technical innovation deeds emerged throughout the factory. The multi-cutter bed for machining gas generator bodies created by veteran workers Gu Weizhi, Wang Antai, and others increased efficiency by eighteen times; thanks to the workers' reform of equipment and the adoption of new operating methods, a large number of gas generators were rushed out to support farmers in fighting drought.
    Relevant departments have recently approved the Andong Machinery Factory to produce this type of tractor in batches starting in the second half of this year, and will improve existing shortcomings (such as wheel spacing, non-adjustability, and inability to cultivate between rows) during production.

### 充分发挥职工群众的聪明才智  安东小修理厂大造拖拉机

    充分发挥职工群众的聪明才智
    安东小修理厂大造拖拉机
    本报安东4日电　记者鲁蛮报道：地方国营安东机械厂的职工，发扬独创精神，克服技术、设备、原材料的重重困难，不怕别人的讥笑，打破了办重工业的神秘观点，试制成功了“鸭绿江一号”拖拉机。
    这个工厂制造的“鸭绿江一号”拖拉机，现在正在首都全国农具展览会上展出。受到了观众的欢迎。这个厂除了生产这种拖拉机外，正在试制另一种更精密的新型号的四十马力的拖拉机和大量煤气机和各种新式农具。
    安东机械厂是在1952年抗美援朝时白手起家的，起初只是一个小修理厂。他们找了几间民房，安上四台已经磨损了齿轮的皮带牵引车床。全厂三十多人中，连一个见习技术员都没有。他们在“依靠党、依靠老工人，为农村服务”的办厂方针下，试制了许多新产品。
    1956年农业合作化高潮时，市工业局曾要他们试制“耕田不用牛”的机器来支援农业生产。当时，工厂一没有拖拉机仿照、二没有技术资料，要造拖拉机真是困难重重。领导干部组织了以老工人为骨干的“新产品试制小组”，他们一方面摸索着干，一方面翻刊物、查资料、派人出去找实物测绘。他们以匈牙利的拖拉机为蓝本，结合本厂设备和技术条件，决定试制单缸轮胎式拖拉机。在试制过程中，职工们充分发挥聪明才智，想出各种办法来克服没有设备、仪器的困难，解决了技术问题。没有材料他们就从废铁堆里找寻。同时在党和试制组同志的支持帮助下，冲破了思想障碍，顶住了冷潮热讽，经过一年多苦战，在1957年2月，一台“土拖拉机”就出世了。但那时没有得到重视，一直到今年春天的大跃进浪潮中才引起了重视。
    “鸭绿江一号”，是三十马力单缸轮胎式拖拉机。经过耕地试验证明，它构造简单，操纵方便，耕地深，能带动三铧犁或四铧犁，每班（十小时）可翻地六十亩以上；不易出事故，出了事故也容易修理；可用普通钢材和生铁制造。除了耕地，它还能作为动力来运输、碾米、发电和排灌；不但可以用柴油，而且可以用重柴油和原油。
    安东机械厂职工最近在技术革命运动中，全厂涌现了大量的技术革新事迹，老工人谷维智、王安太等人创造的车煤气机机体的多头床子，提高效率十八倍；由于工人们改革了设备，采用了新的操作方法，赶制出大批煤气机，支援农民抗旱。
    最近有关方面已经批准安东机械厂从今年下半年起成批生产这种拖拉机，在生产中将对现存缺点（如轮距、不能调整、不能中耕等）进行改进。（附图片）
