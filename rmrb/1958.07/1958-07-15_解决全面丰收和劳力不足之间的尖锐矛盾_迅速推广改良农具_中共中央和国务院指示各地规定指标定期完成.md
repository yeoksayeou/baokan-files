Xinhua News Agency, July 14th. The CCP Central Committee and State Council's directive on rapidly launching a mass movement for farm tool improvement in rural areas:

	The mass movement for improved farm tools, which has accompanied the high tide of agricultural production, has achieved remarkable results. There have been many new creations in improving tillage tools, irrigation and drainage tools, transportation tools, and agricultural product processing tools. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 50,000 types nationwide, with tens of millions already推广(tuī guǎng, popularize, promote, spread) being used. This has already demonstrated its important role in agricultural capital construction and agricultural production since last winter.

	The current problem is that although there are many inventions and creations, they have not been promoted enough. The rural areas are still using a large number of old-fashioned farm tools with very low efficiency. The contradiction between striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest and labor shortages has become acute. Some places have already experienced a situation where production measures cannot be fully implemented due to labor shortages. Therefore, rapidly推广(tuī guǎng, popularize, promote, spread) improved farm tools has become one of the main keys to ensuring a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture. At the same time, improved farm tools are also a basic measure for regulating work and leisure, and a material force for boosting morale. The ideas of "waiting for mechanization" and "waiting to improve tools to perfection before推广(tuī guǎng, popularize, promote, spread) them" are both incorrect. It must be understood that the current focus is on improved farm tools and semi-mechanization. It must also be understood that any new invention or creation is not perfect at the beginning, but must be continuously improved in practical applications and gradually become perfect. The phenomenon of insufficient effort in推广(tuī guǎng, popularize, promote, spread) improved farm tools that exists in some places must be changed.

	The CCP Central Committee and the State Council require a rapid launch of a nationwide movement to推广(tuī guǎng, popularize, promote, spread) improved farm tools and new farm tools. In a relatively short period of time, improved farm tools and new farm tools should be universally used to replace old farm tools, and labor efficiency should be increased by one to two times on the existing basis. To this end, all localities are required to propose tasks, set targets, and determine deadlines for completion based on the needs of their own regions; start with irrigation and drainage tools, cultivating tools, transportation tools, and tools for eliminating pests and diseases that are urgently needed for current production, and prepare for all aspects of labor tools for the autumn harvest, autumn planting, agricultural capital construction, and a greater leap forward in next year's production. From the province to the county to the commune, specialized leadership organizations should be established to be responsible for推广(tuī guǎng, popularize, promote, spread) improved farm tools and strengthen leadership. Experience has proven that as long as the leadership is determined and boldly mobilizes the masses, after mass debates, and truly achieves everyone participating and "everyone being a craftsman and every household being a factory," the farm tool improvement movement can be pushed to a new climax.

    解决全面丰收和劳力不足之间的尖锐矛盾
    迅速推广改良农具
    中共中央和国务院指示各地规定指标定期完成
    新华社14日讯　中共中央、国务院关于迅速在农村展开农具改良运动的指示
    随着农业生产高潮而来的改良农具的群众运动，已经取得了显著的成就。在改良耕作工具、排灌工具、运输工具、农产品加工工具等方面，都有很多新的创造，据不完全统计，全国已达五万余种，已经推广的达数千万件。这对去冬以来的农业基本建设和农业生产，已经显示了它的重要作用。
    当前的问题主要是发明创造很多，但还推广不够，在农村中大量使用的，仍然是效率很低的旧式农具。而在争取全面丰收和劳力不足之间的矛盾，已经显得很尖锐，有些地方已经出现由于劳力紧张而生产措施不能全部实现的情况。因此，迅速推广改良农具，就成为保证农业全面丰收的主要关键之一。同时，改良农具也是调节劳逸的基本措施，和兴旺士气的物质力量。那种“等待机械化”、“等待把工具改良得十全十美之后再去推广”的思想，都是不对的。必须了解，当前的重点是改良农具和半机械化。还必须了解，任何一种新发明创造的东西，一开始总不是十全十美的，而要在实际应用中不断获得改进，逐步趋于完善。当前某些地方存在着的对改良农具推广不力的现象，必须加以改变。
    中共中央和国务院要求迅速展开一个全国范围的推广改良农具和新式农具的运动，在比较短的时间内，用改良农具和新式农具普遍代替旧农具，把劳动效率在现有的基础上提高一倍到两倍。为此，要求各地根据自己地区的需要，提出任务，规定指标，定出完成期限；从当前生产所迫切需要的排灌工具、中耕农具、运输工具和消灭病虫害的工具入手，并为秋收秋种、农田基本建设和明年生产的更大跃进，做好劳动工具方面的一切准备。从省到县到社，都应当建立专门负责推广改良农具的领导组织，加强领导。经验证明，只要领导下定决心，并放手发动群众，经过群众辩论，真正做到全民动手，“人人当工匠、户户是工厂”，就能把农具改良运动推上一个新的高潮。
  　一九五八年七月十三日
