Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 4th. To cooperate with the rapid advances in national economic and cultural construction, Shanghai's higher education is also experiencing a new leap forward.

　　This year, the number of students enrolled in Shanghai's universities will increase by more than 80% compared to last year. Shanghai originally had eighteen universities and colleges, and now four new universities and colleges have been built: the Shanghai Metallurgical College of Jiaotong University, the Shanghai Railway Institute, the Shanghai Railway Medical College, and the Shanghai Medical School. In order to train urgently needed steel and rare metal smelting technology cadres for Shanghai and East China, the Metallurgical College, newly built this year at the Shanghai section of Jiaotong University, has set up majors in Iron and Steel Metallurgy, Non-ferrous Metal Smelting, Steel Pressure Processing, Metallography and Heat Treatment, and Metallurgical Plant Mechanical Equipment. The Shanghai Railway Institute, newly built this year, has two majors: Transportation Management and Telecommunications Signals, to meet the needs of railway transportation.

　　In addition to the four newly built universities and colleges, four specialized courses have also been added to the Shanghai Machine Manufacturing School and the Shanghai Power Machine Manufacturing School, two secondary vocational schools, and new majors have been set up in many schools. In total, Shanghai universities and colleges have added forty new undergraduate and specialized majors this year, all of which are urgently needed for the development of China's industry, agriculture, and scientific undertakings. The vast majority of these majors have never been offered by Shanghai universities and colleges in the past, and a few belong to cutting-edge science and technology fields that China has never offered before. For example, the Department of Mathematics at Fudan University has newly established a Computational Mathematics major, the Department of Physics has newly established Radio Electronics and Material Structure majors, the Department of Biology has newly established a Biophysics major, and the Department of Chemistry has newly established specializations in Rare Elements, Radiochemistry, and Polymer Chemistry.

　　In addition to metallurgy, engineering mainly develops two aspects: chemical engineering and electromechanical engineering (including precision machinery). Petroleum and plastics are the most important aspects of the development of the chemical industry in East China and Shanghai. Therefore, the East China Institute of Chemical Technology has newly established three petroleum-related majors: Petroleum and Natural Gas Extraction, Petroleum and Natural Gas Machinery, and Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering. Plastics are a new industrial sector in China with broad development prospects, and the Polymer Compounds major at the East China Institute of Chemical Technology will mainly train cadres for plastic technology and research work. In terms of electromechanical industry (including precision machinery), Shanghai universities and colleges already had majors to train electromechanical cadres, and enrollment has been expanded this year. However, in the past, there was a lack of majors in precision instruments, electrical instruments, optical instruments, thermal instruments, and radio technology (including television), and this year they have all been set up.

　　In addition, Shanghai's higher industrial schools have also added many majors that reflect the latest science and technology and are urgently needed for basic construction, such as Tongji University's newly established Water Conservancy Construction for Waterways and Ports, Architecture, Road Construction Machinery Equipment, Building Power Supply, Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering, Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology, etc. The East China Institute of Chemical Technology has newly established Rare Elements and Diffusive Elements, Electrochemical Technology, Physical Chemistry Technology, Automation and Regulation of Chemical Production Processes, and Industrial Thermodynamics.

　　In addition to engineering and science majors, Shanghai has also added a Fine Arts and Crafts major to the Shanghai Theatre Academy this year, and new majors such as Oils and Fats and Refrigeration to the Shanghai Fisheries University.

    配合经济和文化建设的突飞猛进
    上海高等学校增设许多专业
    新华社上海4日电　配合着国家经济和文化建设的突飞猛进，上海高等教育事业也出现了新的跃进形势。
    今年上海高等学校招生人数将比去年增加80％以上。上海原有十八所高等学校，现在又新建了交通大学冶金学院、上海铁道学院、上海铁道医学院和上海医学专科学校等四所高等学校。为了培养上海市和华东地区迫切需要的钢铁及稀有金属冶炼技术干部，今年在交通大学上海部分新建的冶金学院，设置了钢铁冶金、有色金属冶炼、钢铁压力加工、金属学及热处理、冶金厂机械设备等专业。今年新建的上海铁道学院，设有运输管理、电信信号两个专业，以满足铁路运输方面的需要。
    除新建四所高等学校外，还在上海机器制造学校和上海动力机器制造学校两所中等专业学校内，增设了四个专修科，并在许多学校里设置了新专业。总计今年上海高等学校本科和专修科新专业共有四十个，这些专业都是发展我国工业农业和科学事业所迫切需要的。其中绝大部分是过去上海高等学校从未设置过的，少数属于尖端科学技术方面的专业，是我国过去没有设置过的。如复旦大学数学系新设的计算数学专业，物理系新设的无线电电子学、物质结构专业，生物系新设的生物物理专业，化学专业新设的稀有元素、放射性化学、高分子化学等专门化。
    工科除了冶金以外，主要发展化工和机电（包括精密机械）两方面。石油和塑料是华东、上海化学工业发展的最主要的方面，因此在华东化工学院新设了有关石油方面的三个专业：石油与天然气开采、石油与天然气机械、石油与天然气工学。塑料是我国新兴的一个工业部门，有着广阔的发展前途，华东化工学院的高分子化合物专业将主要培养塑料工艺和研究工作的干部。机电工业（包括精密机械）方面，上海高等学校原有培养机电干部的专业，今年扩大招生，但是过去却缺少精密仪表、电气仪表、光学仪表、热工仪表和无线电技术（包括电视）等专业，今年就把它们都办起来了。
    此外，上海的高等工业学校还增设了不少反映最新科学技术的和基本建设方面迫切需要的专业，如同济大学新设的水道及港口的水工建筑、建筑、筑路机械设备、建筑供电、土力学及地基基础，水文地质及工程地质等专业，华东化工学院新设的稀有元素及扩散性元素、电化学工艺学、物理化学工艺学、化学生产工艺过程自动化及调节、工业热力学等专业。
    除了工科和理科的专业外，上海今年还在戏剧学院增设了工艺美术专业，在水产学院增设了油脂、冷冻等新专业。
