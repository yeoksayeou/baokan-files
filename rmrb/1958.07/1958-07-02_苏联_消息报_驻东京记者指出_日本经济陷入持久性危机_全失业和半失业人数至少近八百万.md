Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Moscow (TASS dispatch, 1st): "Izvestia" correspondent in Tokyo, Petrov, wrote in "Izvestia" that tens of thousands of Japanese business owners are distressed. Because, he pointed out, today no one doubts that the period of economic boom in Japan is over, and the entire country is sinking deeper and deeper into what appears to be a lasting crisis.

Petrov wrote that in the years of prosperity, Japan had invested huge sums of money in industry, but with the development of productive forces, the typical anarchy of the capitalist economy made the imbalance between production and sales increasingly apparent, which was reflected in the reduction of the operating rate of enterprises.

The author went on to write that the direct result of the production decline is a sharp reduction in the demand for labor. According to the most conservative estimates, the number of fully and partially unemployed people in the country is close to eight million.

Petrov wrote that because the current production recession sweeping all capitalist countries has strongly affected the Japanese economy, which is heavily dependent on foreign trade, the deterioration of the Japanese economic situation has particularly acute characteristics. Petrov emphasized that the calls from all parts of Japan for faster and broader development of economic relations with the socialist camp countries that have no economic crises or production recessions are becoming louder and louder.

    苏联“消息报”驻东京记者指出
    日本经济陷入持久性危机
    全失业和半失业人数至少近八百万
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科1日讯：“消息报”驻东京记者彼得罗夫在“消息报”上著文写道，成千上万的日本企业主都在苦恼。因为，他指出，今天已经没有任何人会怀疑，日本经济景气时期已经结束，全国越来越深地陷入看来是持久性的危机。
    彼得罗夫写道，在景气的年代里，日本曾经向工业投入了巨额资金，但是随着生产力的发展，资本主义经济的典型的无政府状态使生产和销售之间越来越明显地表现出不协调，这反映在企业开工率的降低方面。
    作者接着写道，生产衰落的直接结果是对劳动力需求的剧烈减少。据最保守的统计，国内全失业和半失业的人数将近八百万人。
    彼得罗夫写道，由于目前席卷一切资本主义国家的生产衰退非常强烈地影响了在很大程度上依赖对外贸易的日本经济，所以日本经济情况的恶化就具有特别尖锐的性质。彼得罗夫强调指出，日本各地要求更快和更广泛地同没有经济危机和生产衰退的社会主义阵营各国发展经济关系的呼声越来越宏亮。
