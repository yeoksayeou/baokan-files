Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: A scientific symposium on ethnic research work recently convened a meeting to formulate a Great Leap Forward plan for ethnic research. The aim is to complete the social history survey of ethnic minorities nationwide and the compilation of concise histories and gazetteers of all fifty-one ethnic minorities within the coming year.

This scientific symposium, jointly convened by the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, the Institute of Ethnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Central University for Nationalities, was attended by representatives from eight ethnic minority social history survey teams, including those from Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Also participating were representatives from the Northwest University for Nationalities, the Southwest University for Nationalities, the South-Central Branch of the Central University for Nationalities, the Guangxi University for Nationalities, the Yunnan University for Nationalities, the Guizhou University for Nationalities, the Qinghai University for Nationalities, and the Guangdong and Xinjiang branches of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, totaling more than 130 people.

The meeting, after summarizing the social history survey work of ethnic minorities over the past two years, unanimously agreed that achievements were primary. Social history surveys of twenty ethnic minorities have already been conducted, resulting in approximately 15 million words of survey materials. These materials have played a certain role in the democratic reforms, socialist transformations, and current socialist construction in ethnic minority areas, and have provided valuable data for scientific research. The survey work of the past two years has also cultivated a group of cadres capable of conducting ethnic research work with correct standpoints, viewpoints, and methods.

The meeting was conducted using the methods of "big blooming, big contending, big-character posters, and great debates" of the rectification campaign. The meeting thoroughly exposed and criticized the various anti-Party and anti-socialist criminal activities carried out by bourgeois "ethnologists" and local nationalist elements in ethnic research work, particularly in the social history survey work of ethnic minorities, over the past two years. For example, rightist elements such as Fei Xiaotong, Wu Zelin, and Huang Xianfan once seized leadership positions in the survey teams of Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guizhou for a period, peddling a large amount of reactionary bourgeois "ethnology," which caused great damage to the survey work. There were also some bourgeois ethnic scholars who had not yet been reformed, such as Cen Jiawu, Li Youyi, Yang Kun, and Yang Chengzhi, who openly violated the Party Central Committee's policies in the social history survey work of ethnic minorities, divorced themselves from the leadership of local Party committees, and used reactionary "ethnology" standpoints, viewpoints, and methods to replace the correct Marxist survey methods, thereby causing varying degrees of harm to the survey work. According to the materials revealed at the meeting, local nationalism was relatively prominent within the Xinjiang survey team, represented by the deputy leader, Weigur Shayiran, who violated the central government's policies and the instructions of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Party Committee, and conducted survey work from a nationalist standpoint and viewpoint.

After resolving the major issues of right and wrong in the two-line struggle in ethnic research work, the meeting shifted from theoretical discussion to practical work, discussing many specific issues of how to complete the nationwide social history survey of ethnic minorities, originally planned to take four to seven years, and the compilation of concise histories and gazetteers of all ethnic minorities, originally planned to take three years, within the coming year. The meeting suggested that the Central University for Nationalities, the Institute of Ethnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and relevant central departments should transfer a total of 400 research and teaching staff and students. In addition to supplementing the existing eight survey teams, eight new survey teams will be added in Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Fujian, and Hunan. A widespread approach will be adopted to simultaneously conduct a comprehensive survey of the social history of all fifty-one ethnic minorities nationwide, and on the basis of the survey work, compile concise histories and gazetteers of each ethnic group. This is the largest-scale survey work of ethnic minority areas since the founding of our country.

During the meeting, Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Deputy Director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission, attended and gave instructions. Xie Fumin, Deputy Director of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, delivered a concluding speech at the end of the meeting.

    民族研究工作科学讨论会制定跃进规划
    一年完成少数民族社会历史调查
    据新华社11日讯　民族研究工作科学讨论会最近召开会议，制定了民族研究工作大跃进的规划。要在今后一年内，完成全国少数民族社会历史调查和编写全国五十一个少数民族的简史、简志的工作。
    这次科学讨论会由全国人民代表大会民族委员会、中国科学院民族研究所和中央民族学院共同召开，参加的有内蒙古、新疆、西藏、四川、云南、贵州、广东、广西等八个少数民族社会历史调查组的代表，有西北民族学院、西南民族学院、中央民族学院中南分院、广西民族学院、云南民族学院、贵州民族学院、青海民族学院以及中国科学院的广东分院、新疆分院的代表，共一百三十多人。
    会议在总结了两年来的少数民族社会历史调查工作以后，一致认为成绩是主要的，现在已经进行了二十个少数民族的社会历史调查，调查材料约一千五百万字。这些材料对少数民族地区的民主改革、社会主义改造和当前的社会主义建设都起了一定的作用，为科学研究工作提供了许多有价值的资料。两年来的调查工作，也培养出了一批能够用正确的立场、观点、方法进行民族研究工作的干部。
    会议用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的整风方法进行。这次会议彻底地揭发和批判了两年来在民族研究工作中，特别是在少数民族社会历史调查工作中，资产阶级“民族学家”和地方民族主义分子所进行的各种反党反社会主义的罪恶活动。例如右派分子费孝通、吴泽霖、黄现璠等，曾经在一个时期内窃据云南、广西、贵州等调查组的领导职务，大量贩卖资产阶级“民族学”的反动货色，使调查工作受到很大损失。还有一些尚未经过改造的资产阶级民族学者，如岑家梧、李有义、杨坤、杨成志等，在少数民族社会历史调查工作中也公然违反党中央的方针，脱离当地党委的领导，用反动的“民族学”的立场、观点和方法来代替马克思主义的正确的调查方法，因而使调查工作受到了程度不同的危害。根据会议揭发的材料，地方民族主义在新疆调查组内是比较突出的，以副组长维古尔·沙依然为代表，他们违反中央方针，违反新疆维吾尔自治区党委指示，用民族主义的立场和观点进行调查工作。
    会议在解决了民族研究工作中两条道路斗争的大是大非问题以后，便由务虚转为务实，讨论了如何在今后一年内，完成原定四年至七年完成的全国少数民族社会历史调查和原定三年完成编写各少数民族简史、简志的许多具体问题。会议建议由中央民族学院、中国科学院民族研究所和中央有关部门，抽调研究、教学人员和学员共四百人，除充实原有的八个调查组外，并新增加甘肃、青海、宁夏、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、福建、湖南等八个调查组，采取遍地开花的办法，对全国五十一个少数民族的社会历史同时展开全面调查，并在调查工作的基础上进行各民族简史、简志的编写工作。这是我国开国以来对少数民族地区的一次最大规模的调查工作。
    在会议进行期间，中共中央统战部副部长、民族事务委员会副主任汪锋到会作了指示。全国人民代表大会民族委员会副主任谢扶民在会议结束时作了总结性的讲话。
