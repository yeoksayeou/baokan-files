Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 6th: French Prime Minister De Gaulle and U.S. Secretary of State Dulles held talks in Paris on the 5th. Sources indicate that there were significant differences between the two sides during the meeting.

It is reported that the primary issue discussed was France's demand to possess nuclear weapons as a condition for the U.S. establishing missile bases in France. On this matter, both sides held firm to their respective positions, resulting in no agreement.

According to a French official spokesperson, De Gaulle expressed to Dulles during the meeting that "France is 'suitable' to become an atomic nation, and is determined to do so. De Gaulle emphasized that this is a fundamental issue for France at present." France believes that the status of an atomic nation is a position that France "is capable of achieving and has the right to demand." It was revealed that while stating France's position, De Gaulle insisted that the U.S. help France master the secrets of atomic weapons. However, Dulles replied to De Gaulle that it was "inappropriate" for France to be in such a hurry to become an atomic nation and further stated that, according to the U.S. McMahon Act, the U.S. could not provide France with secret technical intelligence on atomic weapons. According to U.S. news agencies, the meeting "completely failed to eliminate the differences between the United States and France regarding France's atomic bomb program."

Commentary published by French newspapers during the meeting pointed out that France wants to produce its own atomic bombs because it is eager to join the Western "atomic club" in order to take this opportunity to "play an equally active role alongside the United States and Britain within the North Atlantic Alliance." However, according to the newspapers, Dulles was not interested in this.

The meeting also discussed the situation between the East and West, the issue of a summit conference, the Middle East issue, and the Far East issue.

During the meeting, Dulles also handed De Gaulle a letter from U.S. President Eisenhower, inviting De Gaulle to visit the United States at his "convenience."

    杜勒斯同戴高乐的会谈表明
    美法重要分歧没有消除
    新华社6日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理戴高乐同美国国务卿杜勒斯5日在巴黎举行了会谈。各方面的消息表明，在这次会谈中，双方有很大的分歧。
    据报道，这次会谈中占首要地位的问题是，法国要求拥有核武器作为美国在法国设立导弹基地的条件。在这个问题上，双方各执己见，因而没有达成任何协议。
    据法国官方发言人说，戴高乐曾在这次会谈中向杜勒斯表示，“法国‘适宜于’成为一个原子国家，而且也决心这样做。戴高乐强调指出，这是法国当前的根本问题”。法国认为，原子国家的地位是法国“有能力达到和有权利要求的地位”。据透露，在表明法国的这个态度的同时，戴高乐坚持要美国帮助法国掌握原子武器的秘密。但是，杜勒斯回答戴高乐说：法国在目前就急于成为一个原子国家是“不适当的”，他并且表示，根据美国麦克马洪法的规定，美国不能向法国提供原子武器的秘密技术情报。据美国通讯社报道，双方在会谈中“完全没有能够消除美国和法国在法国的原子弹计划方面的意见分歧”。
    法国报纸在会谈过程中发表的评论指出，法国想要自己生产原子弹是因为它急于想加入西方的“原子俱乐部”，以便趁此“北大西洋联盟内同美国和英国并肩起同等积极的作用”，但是，据报纸透露，杜勒斯对这一点并不感到兴趣。
    在这次会谈中，还讨论了东西方之间的局势和最高级会议问题以及中东问题和远东问题等。
    杜勒斯在会谈中还把一封美国总统艾森豪威尔的信交给了戴高乐，邀请戴高乐在他认为“方便”的时候到美国去访问。
