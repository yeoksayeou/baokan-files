    Condemning Tito's Reactionary Speech in Labin

    Editor's Note: After the full text of Tito's speech in Labin was published in this newspaper, the editorial department received many letters from readers protesting Tito's slanderous remarks against our country and expressing the principled spirit of the people of the whole country to fight to the end against modern revisionism. Excerpts from some of the letters are published below:

    Seeing Through the Face of a Traitor

    Tito said, "Eastern countries avoid publishing our (Yugoslav leadership group) materials in full and avoid letting the public opinion of these countries understand such materials." This is nonsense. We saw the full text of Tito's speech in Pula in the December 1956 "People's Daily", and recently we also saw the separate edition of the Yugoslav Communist Program (draft) published in our country. After reading these articles, we clearly saw through the face of the traitor who betrayed the Yugoslav people.

    After vigorously praising American imperialism and "U.S. Aid," Tito also said: "They (referring to our country) are in the same position as the most reactionary war-mongers in the West." This is a complete lie. The Chinese people have supported peace and opposed war in the past, present, and future. The people of the world know very well the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence initiated by China and India and the peaceful diplomatic policy consistently implemented by the Chinese government. The recent withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea once again shows that we love peace and oppose war. Only notorious war-mongers like Dulles, who have always reversed black and white, slander our country as an "aggressor." Now Tito also uses the same words to slander our country, which can only show that his own position is on par with the war-mongers. Isn't this the role of "U.S. Aid"?

    From Tito's entire speech, we cannot see any condemnation of American imperialism, but it expresses servile praise, but it tries its best to slander and vilify socialist countries, which fully exposes the ugly face of modern revisionism, the tool of imperialism. We must resolutely fight to the end against modern revisionism!

    Not Allowing Poisonous Snakes to Cause Harm

    Many of us are members of agricultural cooperatives. From the "People's Daily", we saw Tito's speech. He said repeatedly that U.S. Aid is good, while shamelessly slandering and attacking our country and the Soviet Union. He uses this purely imperialist-lackey-like face to cheer for imperialism, especially American imperialism, which can only further expose his face. The Chinese people have long seen the viciousness of imperialism, and have also learned an important lesson: we must always strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    We hate and despise imperialism and its lackeys. Spring has come—the spring of socialism where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind has come, and poisonous snakes are also coming out of their holes! But we will definitely not let him harm mankind.

    A Poisonous Weed

    Tito could not answer a single word regarding all the substantive issues of the world's communist parties' criticism of modern revisionism; Tito launched the most vicious attacks and slanders against the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries who resolutely defend Marxism-Leninism.

    He said that we wanted to use the criticism of modern revisionism, "this hostile attitude towards Yugoslavia, to solve these difficulties" because we "have internal difficulties." This is really absurd. Under the illumination of the Party's socialist general line, our 600 million people are full of energy, and miracles are everywhere. Any so-called "internal difficulties" cannot defeat our heroic and hard-working people. Instead, Tito should think about why you are singing praises to American wheat.

    He said that we "are in the same position as the most reactionary war-mongers in the West." But, as everyone knows, it was the Chinese people, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, who, together with the Korean people, extinguished the flames of war ignited by American imperialism in Korea with their own blood, and stopped the danger of American imperialism provoking a world war! But Tito is trying to undermine the socialist camp and the international workers' movement, the pillars of world peace, and wants to use the danger of war to scare people from opposing imperialism.

    The face of modern revisionists is being exposed. This poisonous weed will be a useful negative example not only for the Chinese people but also for the Yugoslav people.

    Real Gold Always Shines

    From all the slanders, attacks, and abuses that Tito has made against the Soviet Union, China, and various socialist countries, we have truly learned how vicious and shameless the revisionists, the agents of imperialism, are! The Chinese people have completely seen through the reactionary remarks of the Yugoslav revisionists, and we also know that we must be more vigilant and firmly stand on the position of the working class and fight to the end against reactionary modern revisionism! Tito slandered that our criticism of their reactionary revisionism seemed to be because we needed some kind of loan to solve our "internal difficulties". This deliberate slander and vilification just shows that he himself wants to use this reactionary speech to ask American imperialism for a reward again. Tito is now playing the role of smearing others' faces with dirt, trying to reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong. However, real gold always shines, and slander cannot damage its brilliance in the slightest.

### 痛斥铁托在拉宾的反动演说

    痛斥铁托在拉宾的反动演说
    编者按：铁托在拉宾的演说全文在本报刊登之后，本报编辑部收到了很多读者的来信，他们抗议铁托污蔑我国的言论，并且表示了全国人民对现代修正主义斗争到底的原则精神。现将一部分来信摘要发表如下：看穿了叛徒的嘴脸
    铁托说：“东方国家避免全文发表我们（指南斯拉夫领导集团）的材料以及避免使这些国家的舆论了解这种材料”，这是胡说。我们在1956年12月的“人民日报”上，看到过铁托在普拉演说的全文，最近又看到了我国出版的南共纲领（草案）的单行本。我们看了这些文章后，清楚地看穿了出卖南斯拉夫人民的叛徒的嘴脸。
    铁托在大肆歌颂了美帝国主义及“美援”后又说：“他们（指我国）同西方最反动的战争贩子处于同样的地位。”这是道道地地的谎话。中国人民过去、现在和将来都拥护和平，反对战争。全世界人民都清楚地知道中国和印度所倡议的和平共处五项原则以及中国政府所一贯执行的和平外交政策。而最近中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜，又一次说明我们是热爱和平，反对战争的。只有一贯颠倒黑白的著名战争贩子杜勒斯之流才污蔑我国为“侵略者”。现在铁托也用同样的言词来污蔑我国，这显然只能说明他自己的立场是与战争贩子处于同等地位。这不是“美援”所起的作用是什么呢？
    我们从铁托的通篇演说中看不到一点对美帝国主义的谴责，却表现了奴颜婢膝的歌颂，但对社会主义国家却极力诽谤和污蔑，这充分暴露了帝国主义的工具——现代修正主义的丑恶面貌。我们要坚决与现代修正主义斗争到底！

    不让毒蛇为害
    我们之中的很多人是农业社社员。从“人民日报”上，我们看到铁托的演说，他口口声声说美援好，而无耻的诽谤和攻击我国和苏联。他用这种纯帝国主义奴才式的嘴脸来为帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义叫好，只能更加暴露他的面目。中国人民早就看清了帝国主义的毒辣，而且也早就得到了一条重要的经验：我们要永远加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一致。
    我们憎恨和鄙视帝国主义及其奴才。春天来了——是东风压倒西风的社会主义的春天来了，毒蛇也要出洞了！但是我们一定不让他为害人类。

                      孔祥寿　叶国其
            一株毒草
    对于全世界共产党批判现代修正主义的所有实质问题，铁托回答不出一个字；对于坚决捍卫马克思列宁主义的苏联、中国和其它国家的共产党，铁托进行了最恶毒的攻击和诽谤。
    他说我们因为“有内部困难”，想用批判现代修正主义“这种对南斯拉夫的敌对态度来解决这些困难”。这真是荒唐透顶的说法。我国六亿人民在党的社会主义总路线照耀下，干劲冲天，奇迹遍地，任何所谓“内部困难”都难不倒我国英勇勤劳的人民。倒是铁托应该想一想，为什么你唱上美国小麦万岁的颂歌来了。
    他说我们“同西方最反动的战争贩子处于同样的地位”。但是，谁都知道，正是伟大中国共产党领导下的中国人民和朝鲜人民一起用自己的鲜血扑灭了美帝国主义在朝鲜燃起的战火，制止了美帝国主义挑起世界战争的危险！而铁托却企图破坏世界和平支柱的社会主义阵营和国际工人运动，想用战争的危险恐吓人们不要反对帝国主义。
    现代修正主义者的面目正被揭穿。这株毒草，不仅对中国人民，而且对南斯拉夫人民，都会是有益的反面教材。

        真正的黄金永远闪光
    我们从铁托对苏联、中国以及各社会主义国家所进行的一切诽谤、攻击、谩骂中，真正领教了帝国主义代理人的修正主义者是多么穷凶极恶，卑劣无耻！中国人民完全看清了南斯拉夫修正主义者的反动言论，我们也知道要更加提高警惕，坚定地站在工人阶级立场与反动的现代修正主义斗争到底！铁托诬蔑我们批评他们的反动修正主义似乎是因为我们需要某种贷款来解决我们“内部困难”，这番费尽心机的诽谤和诬蔑正好说明了他自己又想用这篇反动演说去向美帝国主义再一次讨取赏金。铁托现在扮演着往别人的白脸上抹黑灰的角色，企图颠倒黑白，混淆是非。可是，真正的黄金永远是闪光的，诽谤决不能丝毫损伤它的光辉。
