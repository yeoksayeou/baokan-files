The spring-sown and summer-sown soybeans, peanuts, sesame, flax, and other oil crops across the country are generally growing well. The spring-sown crops have generally blossomed, and the summer-sown seedlings are growing vigorously. Currently, farmers in various regions are strengthening field management of these crops, striving for a bumper harvest and aiming to launch high-yield "satellites" of oil crops.

Preparations for planting soybeans, peanuts, and sesame during the "Fu" season in the Lingnan area and some regions south of the Yangtze River have also begun, and sowing is expected to start at the end of the month.

According to preliminary reports from various regions to relevant departments: This year, due to the expansion of the planting area of high-yield crops, the soybean planting area has decreased somewhat compared to last year; the planting area of peanuts, sesame, etc., is roughly the same as last year. Therefore, various regions are focusing on increasing the yield per unit area as the main content of striving for a great leap forward in oil crop production. To this end, various regions have generally strengthened field management of these oil crops. In major soybean-producing areas such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces, soybeans have generally been hoed and cultivated three times, one or two times more than in the same period in previous years. Boli County in Heilongjiang Province has already hoed and cultivated five times, so the soybean seedlings are growing very well and have already blossomed and closed the ridges. In major peanut-producing areas such as Shandong and Henan provinces, most areas have been cultivated twice, and some key peanut counties have been cultivated three or more times. In Puyang County, Henan Province, over 168,000 mu of peanuts have been generally cultivated three to four times, and each mu has also been top-dressed with more than 4,000 jin of soil fertilizer or 15 jin of chemical fertilizer. In Penglai County, Shandong Province, peanuts are growing very well due to good field management and the application of large amounts of fertilizer.

This year, the sowing quality of soybeans, peanuts, sesame, and flax in various regions has greatly improved compared to previous years. In Northeast China, soybeans underwent meticulous land preparation work before sowing, and the amount of fertilizer applied was more than double that of last year. Farmers in the Huanghuai River basin have also changed the habit of not applying base fertilizer when sowing soybeans this year, and most soybean fields have received a large amount of base fertilizer. Farmers in peanut-producing areas have also applied more than double the amount of base fertilizer to peanut fields compared to last year. Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and other provinces generally applied 5,000 to 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and some key peanut counties applied more than 20,000 jin per mu. At the same time, close planting was generally implemented, with the number of peanut holes per mu increasing by half to one time compared to last year. The area of deeply plowed peanut fields has also greatly increased compared to previous years. In Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, all 3 million mu of peanut fields were deeply plowed. In Daming and Luan counties, Hebei Province, more than 390,000 mu of peanut fields were deeply plowed, accounting for more than 73% of the oil crop planting area in the two counties. In addition, various regions have also paid attention to promoting improved varieties of the above-mentioned oil crops, and the area planted with improved varieties has greatly increased compared to last year.

    油料生产跃进的关键何在？
    加强田间管理  提高单位产量
    本报讯　全国各地春种和夏种的大豆、花生、芝麻、胡麻等油料作物一般生长良好。春种的已经普遍开花，夏种的幼苗生长茁壮，当前各地农民正对这些作物加强田间管理，力争大丰收，力争发出油料作物的高产“卫星”。
    岭南地区和长江以南部分地区伏种大豆、花生、芝麻的准备工作也已开始，预计月底即将开犁播种。
    据各地向有关部门初步汇报：今年由于扩大了高产作物种植面积，大豆播种面积比去年有所减少；花生、芝麻等种植面积只和去年大体相同。这样，各地就把提高单位面积产量，作为力争油料作物生产大跃进的主要内容。为此，各地对这些油料作物普遍加强了田间管理。大豆主要产区黑龙江、吉林、辽宁等省，目前对大豆已经普遍铲趟三遍，比往年同期多一、两遍。黑龙江省勃利县已经铲趟五遍，因此，豆秧生长得很好，已经开花封垅。花生主要产区山东、河南等省，大部已中耕二次，有些花生重点县已中耕三次以上。河南省濮阳县的十六万八千多亩花生，已普遍中耕三到四次，每亩还追施了四千多斤土肥或十五斤化肥。山东省蓬莱县的花生由于田间管理搞的好并且追施了大量肥料，生长得很好。
    今年各地大豆、花生、芝麻和胡麻等播种质量比往年大大提高。东北地区的大豆在播种前都进行了细致的整地工作，施肥量比去年增加一倍以上；黄淮流域的农民今年也改变了播种大豆不施基肥的习惯，多数豆地施了大量基肥。花生产区的农民，在花生地里施的基肥也比去年增加一倍以上，山东、河南、河北等省一般每亩施肥五千斤到一万斤，有些花生重点县每亩施肥二万多斤。同时，还普遍实行了密植，每亩花生穴数比去年增加了半倍到一倍；深翻的花生地也比往年大大增多，山东省莱阳专区三百万亩花生地全部进行了深翻，河北大名、滦县深翻的花生地三十九万多亩，占两县油料作物播种面积的73％以上。此外，各地还注意推广了上述几种油料作物的优良品种，良种面积比去年大大增加。
