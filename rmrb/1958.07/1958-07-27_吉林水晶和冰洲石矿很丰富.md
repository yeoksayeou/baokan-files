    Jilin is Rich in Quartz and Iceland Spar Deposits
    A rare and valuable mineral, Iceland spar, has recently been discovered in the Helong County area of Jilin Province. After identification, this mineral is of good quality and has exploitable value.
    Iceland spar is a raw material for manufacturing advanced optical instruments, such as polarizers in polarizing microscopes. This mineral is rarely found. In previous years, it was also discovered in Linjiang and Yongji, Jilin Province.
    Not long ago, quartz deposits were also discovered in sixteen counties in Jilin Province, including Dongliao, Jiaohe, Antu, and Yongji. Some of the minerals are of excellent quality and have great exploitable value. The colors include white, brown, and black, with brown being the most common. Dongliao County has recently mined more than 5,000 jin of quartz, with the largest single piece weighing 1,400 jin. (Xiaolin)

    吉林水晶和冰洲石矿很丰富
    一种稀有贵重的矿石——冰洲石，最近在吉林省和龙县地区发现，经过鉴定，这种矿石质量较好，有开采价值。
    冰洲石是制造高级光学仪器的原料，如制偏光显微镜中的偏光仪等。这种矿石很少发现。前几年，还在吉林省临江、永吉等地发现过。
    不久以前，吉林省东辽、蛟河、安图、永吉等十六县还发现了水晶矿。有些矿质优良，很有开采价值。色种有白色、茶色和墨色，其中以茶色为最多。东辽县最近已经采出五千多斤水晶，最大一颗重一千四百斤。　　　　　　　（晓林）
