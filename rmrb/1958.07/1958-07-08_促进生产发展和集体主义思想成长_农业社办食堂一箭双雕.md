    Promoting Production Development and Fostering Collectivist Ideology
    Agricultural Cooperatives Running Mess Halls Kill Two Birds with One Stone
    (Our dispatch) Recently, in Shaoyang and Taoyuan counties of Hunan, and in some areas of Public Security county of Hubei and Anxi county of Fujian, agricultural cooperatives, in the midst of the great leap forward in agricultural production and with relatively tight labor and animal power, have been experimenting with public mess halls based on the principle of voluntary participation by members, and have been welcomed by the masses.
    The Cooperation Department of the Anxi County Committee of Fujian summarized eight major benefits of public mess halls, mainly: First, the meal times are consistent, and members no longer wait for each other to go to work, attend meetings, or study, saving a lot of labor for production; Second, women's labor is freed from the household labor of cooking, adding a batch of labor; Third, it solves the difficulties of single men cooking and feeding pigs; Fourth, collective feeding of livestock and poultry makes the cooperative have more light labor, and "Five Guarantees" households who are slightly able to work can participate in work, thus reducing the number of "Five Guarantees" households and reducing the burden on cooperative members; Fifth, planned use of grain can eliminate the phenomenon of overeating, and no one complains about food problems; Sixth, it is easy to develop collective sideline occupations; Seventh, in the past, couples, sisters-in-law, sisters, and mothers-in-law often had disagreements due to cooking and eating, but now this phenomenon is gone, and families are harmonious; Eighth, separation of humans and animals greatly improves hygiene, and cooperative members are in a good mood. To sum up these benefits, it is that it increases labor, reduces contradictions in food problems, unites the masses, and raises the collective awareness of cooperative members. The Cooperation Department of the Anxi County Committee also specially summarized the successful experience of the Gaoshan Cooperative in Hukou Township in running public mess halls and promoted it.
    At the beginning of this work, these places first conducted full publicity and education to the masses, clearly explained the policy boundaries, and avoided causing unnecessary concerns among the masses. After some places established collective canteens, some people said, "Eating from the big pot is really egalitarian!" Some people also asked, "After implementing collective eating and living, will there still be more pay for more work and more food for more work; will there still be feed land, can pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, etc. still be fed; are living materials still private property?" These misunderstandings were eliminated after explanation.

    促进生产发展和集体主义思想成长
    农业社办食堂一箭双雕
    本报讯  最近湖南邵阳、桃源县，湖北公安县和福建安溪县部分地区的农业社，在农业生产大跃进、劳畜力比较紧张的情况下，根据社员自愿参加的原则，经过试点举办公共食堂，受到群众欢迎。
    福建安溪县委合作部总结公共食堂有八大好处，主要是：一、吃饭时间一致了，社员出工、开会和学习都不再互相等待了，可以节省出许多劳力用于生产；二、可以把妇女劳动力从做饭的家务劳动中解放出来，增加了一批劳动力；三、解决了单身汉做饭、喂猪的困难；四、家畜家禽集体喂养了，社里的轻微劳动就多一些，稍能劳动的“五保”户都可以参加工作，这样就减少了“五保”户，减轻社员负担；五、有计划地用粮，就可以消灭吃过头粮的现象，也没有人闹粮食问题了；六、便于发展集体副业；七、过去夫妇、妯娌、姑嫂、婆媳之间，往往因做饭、吃饭问题闹意见，现在这种现象没有了，家庭和睦了；八、人畜分居，卫生情况大改善，社员心情舒畅。把这些好处归结起来，就是增加了劳动力，减少了粮食问题的矛盾，团结了群众，提高了社员集体主义的觉悟。安溪县委合作部还专门总结了湖头乡高山社办公共食堂的成功经验，加以推广。
    在开始这一工作的时候，这些地方都首先向群众进行充分的宣传教育，交代清楚政策界限，避免群众引起一些不必要的疑虑。有些地方成立集体食堂后，有人说：“吃大锅饭可算平均啦！”还有的人提出：“实行集体吃饭、集体居住后，还要不要多劳多得、多劳多吃；是不是还有饲料地，猪、羊、鸡、鸭等是否还可以喂；生活资料是否还属于私人财产”等等。这些误解，经过解释后消除了。
