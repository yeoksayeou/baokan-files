    Coarse and Fine
    Zhao Qi
    With the unprecedented bumper harvests of various crops, some people have developed the mistaken idea that scattering a little grain is nothing, anyway, it won't affect the overall yield, it's not a big problem. Therefore, when harvesting, they are not meticulously gathering and threshing, but instead adopting a rough and careless method.
    This idea and practice are obviously wrong. A little thought will make it clear: the vast number of farmers, from spring to summer to autumn, from plowing to planting to harvesting, working hard day and night to obtain the grain, even a single grain scattered in the field is extremely wrong. If cadres have this idea, it means their mass viewpoint is weak; if some commune members have this idea, it means their collectivist ideological awareness is not high. Whether it's cadres or the masses, anyone with this idea lacks a labor viewpoint and does not cherish the labor of others and their own.
    With a bumper harvest, is scattering a little grain really nothing? A large number of past facts have proven that this is not a trivial matter of "nothing," but a major matter that deserves great attention. Last year, the rice seedlings in the fields of the Liantang Agricultural Cooperative in Nanchang, Jiangxi, were much better than those of the neighboring Pengjia Agricultural Cooperative, but because Pengjia Cooperative harvested meticulously, the average yield of early rice per mu was more than sixty jin higher than that of Liantang Cooperative. Look, can this be said to not affect the harvest, can it be said to be a trivial matter that doesn't matter? The difference between coarse harvesting and fine harvesting in these two cooperatives is so great, and there will be the same difference in other agricultural cooperatives. After vigorously reforming agricultural technology in recent years, many people admit that the advancement and backwardness of cultivation techniques are directly related to the high and low unit yields. How can they not know that the level of unit yield is also determined by whether the harvesting method is coarse or fine?
    People also know that harvesting with a coarse method will scatter grain. But when it comes to the amount of scattering, they feel that "after eating, there will always be a grain of rice left in the bowl, and scattering a few jin of grain per mu is nothing." The problem lies here, a few jin or a dozen jin scattered per mu is "nothing," then hundreds of mu, thousands of mu, tens of thousands of mu... is that also nothing? According to the news from Changde Prefecture, Hunan, published in this newspaper today, if calculated at a loss of 80 jin of rice per mu, the entire prefecture's 5.54 million mu of early rice will have a loss of more than 400 million jin of rice. Here, the calculation range can be further expanded to the entire early rice producing area. If the country has 160 million mu of early rice, and we calculate it at scattering 10 jin per mu, how much is lost? A full 1.6 billion jin, enough for more than 4 million people to eat for a year. Can this be said to be "nothing"? You must know that now is different from the past, every person is the master of the country. Since we are the masters of the country, we must consider issues from the perspective of the whole country. We are a large country with a large cultivated area. If we scatter a little grain per mu, we will scatter a lot. Don't look at the fact that the percentage of these few jin of scattered grain is very small compared to the increased yield, but when you calculate the total, the amount is very large, and it is not "scattering a little is nothing."
    Harvesting is an important link in agricultural production. With the improvement of cultivation techniques, harvesting techniques should also be improved accordingly. Changing from coarse to meticulous is the specific content of this improvement. Of course, to make such an improvement in harvesting work, we must first enable people to have a correct view of the significance of improving harvesting methods. People's actions depend on their thoughts. Without truly recognizing the benefits of meticulous harvesting from the ideological level, it is difficult to overcome the careless and rough practices in harvesting work. Now is the season for early rice harvesting, let us have a competition of quick harvesting and threshing, and meticulous harvesting and threshing, so that the bumper harvest of early rice can achieve a complete bumper harvest.

    粗和细
    赵起
    随着各种农作物的空前大丰收，在有些人的头脑中产生了这样一种错误思想：抛撒一点儿粮食不算什么，反正影响不了整个产量，这不是什么大问题。因此，在进行收获的时候，便不是细收细打，而是采取了粗放的方法。
    这种想法和作法显然是不对的，只要略为想一想，就会很清楚的：广大农民从春到夏到秋，从耕到种到收，费心费力贪早卖黑地劳动得到的粮食，哪怕是一粒抛撒在田里，都是极大的不应该。干部有这种思想，就是群众观点不强；部分社员有这种思想，就是集体主义思想觉悟不高。不论是干部还是群众，只要有这种思想，就是缺乏劳动观点，就是不珍惜别人的和自己的劳动。
    大丰收了，抛撒一点粮食真的不算什么吗？过去已经有过大量的事实证明，这不是“不算什么”的小事，而是一件很值得重视的大事。去年江西南昌莲塘农业社田里的禾苗比邻近的彭家农业社好得多，可是由于彭家社收获细致，每亩早稻的平均收获量反比莲塘社多六十多斤。请看，这能说不影响丰收，能说是一件算不了什么的小事吗？粗收和细收在这两个社有这样大的区别，在别的农业社也会有同样区别。经过近几年来大力改革农业技术，许多人承认栽培技术的先进和落后直接关系到单位产量的高和低。岂不知单位产量的高低，还决定于收获方法的粗或细。
    人们也知道，用粗放的方法收获就会抛撒粮食。但是在谈到抛撒数量的时候，竟觉得“吃罢饭碗里还短不了剩个米粒，一亩地抛撒几斤粮更算不了什么”。问题就出在这里，一亩地抛撒几斤或十几斤“不算什么”，那么百亩、千亩、万亩……呢，也不算什么吗？从本报今天发表的湖南常德专区的消息来看，如果按每亩田损失稻谷八十斤计算，全专区五百五十四万亩早稻就要有四亿多斤稻谷的损失。在这里还可以把计算范围再扩大到整个早稻产区，如果全国一亿六千万亩早稻，就按每亩抛撒十斤计算，损失多少呢？整整十六亿斤，足够四百多万人一年食用。这能说“算不了什么”吗？要知道，现在和过去不同了，每一个人民都是国家的主人，既然是国家的主人，考虑问题时就要从全国出发，我们是一个大国，耕地面积很大，每亩只要抛撒一点点粮食，就要抛撒很多。别看抛撒的这几斤粮食同增加的产量比起来占的百分比很小，一算总账数量就很大了，就不是“抛撒一点算不了什么”了。
    收获是农业生产的一个重要环节，随着栽培技术的改进，收获技术也应该跟着改进。改粗放为细致就是这种改进的具体内容。当然，要使收获工作有这样的改进，就必须先使人对改进收获方法的意义有正确的看法。人的行动取决于思想，没有真正从思想上认识到精收细打的好处，就很难在收获工作上克服大手大脚的粗放作法。现在正是早稻收获的季节，让我们来个快收快打、细收细打的竞赛，使丰产了的早稻得到全部丰收。
