    Bombay Dispatch: The "Free Press" said on the 26th that there are no indications that the recent manifestations of the rising tide of Arab nationalism – including the coup in Iraq – pose any threat to the continued supply of oil to Western Europe. In fact, the new Iraqi government has guaranteed full respect for the country's commercial and political obligations to the West. Recent developments inevitably increase the difficulty of finding solutions at a summit conference, if they do not delay the summit altogether. "The question now is whether the West is sincere about a summit conference at all. If Britain is eager for the summit to resolve the West Asian crisis, it would not deliberately exacerbate the crisis while the delicate details of the meeting are being worked out."

    印度舆论提出质问
    西方对首脑会有无诚意？
    本报讯　孟买消息：“自由新闻”26日说，没有任何迹象表明阿拉伯民族主义日益高涨的浪潮的最近表现——包括伊拉克的政变——是对继续向西欧供应石油的任何威胁。事实上伊拉克新政府已经保证充分尊重这个国家对西方承担的商业和政治义务。最近的局势发展必然不可避免地给在最高级会议上找到解决办法增加了困难，如果它们不使最高级会议拖延的话。“自由新闻”最后说，“现在的问题是西方对于最高级会议到底是否抱有诚意。如果英国切望在最高级会议上使西亚危机得到解决，它就不会在正当制定会议的微妙的细节的时候故意使危机恶化。”
