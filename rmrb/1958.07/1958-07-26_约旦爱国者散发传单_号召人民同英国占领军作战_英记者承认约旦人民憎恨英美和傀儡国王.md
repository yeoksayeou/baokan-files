Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 24th: According to the Voice of Free Jordanian People radio broadcast, Jordanian patriots distributed leaflets on the 24th, calling on the people to fight the British occupation troops.
　　The radio station also reported that Jordanian patriots stabbed a British occupation soldier to death with a knife in the capital Amman on the same day.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 25th: TASS, London, 25th: The "Times" Middle East correspondent openly admitted in a report on the situation in Jordan that King Hussein's regime in Jordan is unpopular and can only be maintained by relying on British troops. The reporter wrote, "There can be no doubt about the potential forces dissatisfied with the government." He believes that "most Jordanian residents harbor hostility towards the British who have invaded their country." According to him, the dissatisfaction has not been expressed publicly "undoubtedly due to the declaration of martial law in the country and the brutal suppression of various signs of resistance to the regime." However, he pointed out that there were five explosions in Amman this week, and on July 20, someone attempted to organize a strike to protest the British military presence; last week, in Nablus, more than a dozen people were arrested after demonstrations in support of the Iraqi national revolution, and arrests were also made in Amman this week.
　　The reporter concluded by writing that in this case, there is no doubt that British troops and American aid are the only means of preserving the regime: if the pillars are removed, the house will collapse. Unfortunately, this situation can only reduce the prestige of the British and Americans among the majority of Jordanian residents who oppose the current regime. Many Jordanians dare not express this idea now, but this fact cannot change the actual situation. In addition, the British presence in Jordan also increases the entire Arab world's hostility towards the West.

    英记者承认约旦人民憎恨英美和傀儡国王
    新华社大马士革24日电　据自由约旦人民之声电台广播，约旦爱国者在24日散发传单，号召人民同英国占领军作战。
    电台还报道，约旦爱国者同一天在首都安曼用刀子刺杀一名英国占领军士兵。
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社伦敦25日讯：“泰晤士报”中东问题记者在关于约旦情况的报道中公开承认，约旦国王侯赛因的政权不得人心，因此只有依靠英国军队才能维持。记者写道，“对于潜在的不满政府的力量不能有任何怀疑”。他认为，“约旦大部分居民对侵入他们国家的英国人怀着敌对情绪”。据他说，不满情绪没有公开表现出来，“无疑是由于国家宣布了军事状态以及对反抗政权的各种征象进行残酷镇压的缘故”。但是，他指出，这一周安曼发生了五起爆炸，7月20日有人企图组织抗议英军留驻的罢工；上一周，在纳布鲁斯，在支持伊拉克国家革命的游行示威以后，有十多人被捕，这一周安曼也进行了逮捕。
    记者最后写道，在这种情况下，毫无疑问，英国军队和美国的援助是保存政权的唯一手段：抽掉了支柱，房子就要塌了。遗憾的是，这种情况只能在反对现政权的大多数约旦居民中降低英国人和美国人的威信。现在许多约旦人不敢说出这种思想，但这个事实不能改变实际情况。此外，英国人留在约旦也增加了整个阿拉伯世界对西方的敌视。
