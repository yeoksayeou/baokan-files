Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: Affected by the economic crisis in the United States and Japan itself, as well as the sluggishness of foreign markets, Japan's import and export trade volume has decreased significantly in the first half of this year.

According to customs statistics released today by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, Japan's export value in the first half of this year was only $1.391 billion, a decrease of 10% compared to the second half of last year; import value was $1.578 billion, a decrease of 18.8% and 32.7% compared to the second half of last year and the first half of last year, respectively. Due to the significant reduction in imports in the first half of this year, the import surplus decreased from more than $400 million in the second half of last year to $186 million.

According to an announcement today by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the export volume of raw silk, one of Japan's important export commodities, was only 3,018 bales in June, a decrease of 41% compared to June of last year; raw silk exports to the United States in June decreased by 37% compared to May, and by 56% compared to June of last year.

In order to compete with other capitalist countries in the international market, Japan unscrupulously uses Japanese goods to impersonate goods from other countries and sell them in foreign markets. According to Kyodo News, since the beginning of this year, countries such as the United States, Britain, Canada, West Germany, and Australia have protested to the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry and various Japanese trading companies regarding the issue of Japanese trading companies stealing the design patterns of foreign goods.

    日本上半年对外贸易锐减
    对外推销冒牌货引起外国抗议
    新华社8日讯  东京消息：日本在美国和日本本国发生经济危机以及国外市场不景气的影响下，今年上半年的进出口贸易额都大大下降。
    据日本大藏省今天公布的报关统计，日本今年上半年的出口额只有十三亿九千一百万美元，比去年下半年减少了10％；进口额为十五亿七千八百万美元，同去年下半年和去年上半年相比，分别减少了18.8％和32.7％。由于今年上半年大大压缩了进口，因此入超从去年下半年的四亿多美元减为一亿八千六百万美元。
    据日本农林省今天宣布，日本重要出口商品之一的生丝在6月份只出口三千零十八包，比去年6月份减少了41％；6月份对美国出口的生丝比5月份减少了37％，而比去年6月份减少了56％。
    日本为了在国际市场上同其他资本主义国家进行竞争，竟不选手段地用日本商品来冒充其他国家的商品，在国外市场上推销。据共同社报道，今年年初以来，美国、英国、加拿大、西德和澳大利亚等国就日本贸易公司盗用外国商品的设计图案这事件，纷纷向日本通商产业省和日本各贸易公司提出了抗议。
