    Sichuan Pepper with Two Harvests a Year

    In the Masanglin Agricultural Cooperative of Ranjiaxiang Township, Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province, there is a Sichuan pepper tree that is five or six years old. It blooms twice and bears fruit twice every year. The masses call it a treasure money tree. According to local farmers, this Sichuan pepper tree was transplanted from the garden four years ago.

    This Sichuan pepper tree has been initially identified as a variety of Fengjiao—Dahongpao (Big Red Robe). It differs from wild pepper or other Sichuan peppers mainly in that: the peppercorns are large, fruitful, high-yielding, and have a fragrant pepper flavor. The first flowering occurs between March and April, fruiting begins in early May, and the fruit ripens at the end of June; the second flowering period is after the first fruiting and leaf fall, that is, in early July, new branches and leaves sprout and bloom, and the fruit matures in October. Last year, in addition to eating green peppers, the first harvest yielded a total of one jin of dried peppers, and the second harvest yielded another half jin. (Wang Dunshan)

    一年两熟的花椒
    陕西南郑县冉家乡马桑林农业社，有一株长了五、六年的花椒树，每年开花两次，结果两次，群众把它叫做宝贝摇钱树。据当地农民说：这株花椒树是前四年从坆园移栽回来的。
    这株花椒树初步鉴定是凤椒的一个品种——大红袍。它和野椒或其他花椒不同之处主要是：椒果大、结实多、产量高、椒味香。第一次在3、4月间开花，5月初成果，6月底实熟；第二次花期在第一次实熟落叶后，即7月上旬重新生枝出叶开花，10月间成熟。去年除吃青椒外，第一次共晒了一斤干椒，第二次还晒了半斤。　　（王墩山）
