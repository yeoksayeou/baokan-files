Cultural Revolution's Splashes
—New Things in Sichuan's Countryside
By our staff reporter Zhou Zuyou

The tide of the Cultural Revolution is surging in the rural areas of Sichuan. Here, not only have thousands of outstanding singers emerged, but also new types of painters and various propagandists are being produced. Here, you can never stop hearing joyful songs and seeing all kinds of vivid new creations.

Every Home Has a Door-Panel Newspaper

"Wooden door panels, every home has them, choose one to be a newspaper; write some rousing words, recite them when going in and out, both thought and culture are bountiful." This is a doggerel composed by the members of the Zhilubei Agricultural Cooperative in Xinmin Township, Nanchong County, praising the door-panel newspaper.

On the door panels of more than 800 households in this cooperative, clapper rhymes and doggerels are dazzling. This family's door says: "Green branches and leaves grow from one tree, the bamboo roots of the mountains are connected, socialism has a good future, cadres and members are of one heart"; that household's door says: "Small streams gather into oceans, thousands of bamboo boards build tile houses, running the cooperative depends on diligence and thrift, don't forget hunger when you are full." According to the local central tasks and farming seasons, the poems on these door panels are constantly changing. Farmers not only often read these poems and doggerels when going to and from work, but some even hold their rice bowls and sit at the door, eating and reading.

The door-panel newspaper is one of the new creations of the Zhilubei Cooperative. In order to conduct regular propaganda and education among the members and help them learn culture, the cooperative's Party organization discovered that making full use of every door panel in the members' homes could create many door-panel newspapers. Therefore, the cooperative's farmer writing group writes easy-to-understand rousing words and clapper rhymes according to the current production and work needs, and the propagandists of each production team write them on the doors of the members' homes. While copying, the propagandists explain the words and meanings on the door-panel newspaper to the farmers. In this way, the main propaganda content on the door-panel newspaper can be known to every household in just one morning. In the previous period, when the cooperative mobilized the members to plant sweet potatoes on all vacant land, many farmers were afraid of no harvest and unwilling to plant. The cooperative then issued a door-panel newspaper with the rousing words "Sweet potato is a treasure, farmers can't do without it, without oil and salt, you can still eat your fill" as the main content. When the propagandists copied it on the doors of each member's home, they did detailed calculations with everyone and explained the benefits of planting sweet potatoes. As a result, the cooperative overfulfilled the sweet potato planting plan in three days.

Storytelling Meetings in Fields and Courtyards

In Changshi Cultivation Zone of Shuangbei Agricultural Cooperative in Beibei District, Chongqing, the most popular form of reading for farmers is storytelling meetings in the fields and courtyards. They carry books with them at all times. During field breaks and after work at night, everyone gathers on the ridges and in the courtyards to tell stories from the books and exchange learning experiences. They talk about literary works such as "Defend Yan'an" and agricultural technology books. Young people like books on revolutionary traditional education such as "Red Flag Fluttering" and "The Youth of Comrade Mao Zedong."

Lin Yunliang, the production team leader in his forties, often becomes the central figure in the storytelling meeting. He used to be semi-literate and is now one of the most well-read people in the cooperative. He tells everyone the story of "Heroes of Lüliang" and classical novels. Once, a pig raised by cooperative member Jiang Jie fell ill. Lin Yunliang introduced Jiang Jie to the prescription for treating pig diseases in the book "How to Raise Livestock." Jiang Jie quickly cured the pig.

The library in this cultivation zone was established in 1956. Now, the number of books circulating from this library each month has increased from more than one hundred to more than one thousand.

Modern "Bao Gong"

In the central area of Dongyue Township, Shehong County, stands a large wooden sign, thirteen feet long and seven or eight feet wide. The large wooden sign is covered with news from various agricultural cooperatives in the township. There are the results of the township-wide production competition, new people and new things, as well as criticisms of backward phenomena. The forms of these news items are also diverse, including prose, folk songs, and ballads. The farmers in this township all like to come here to take a look.

This is the "Leap Forward News Station" of Dongyue Township. The editor-in-chief is Liu Ansheng, the secretary of the township's Party general branch, and the news is provided by various agricultural cooperatives. Once, the Leap Forward News Station published a piece of news praising the Eighth Production Team of the Jinhua Cooperative for planting a large number of vegetables. This team planted an average of more than 250 seedlings per person. After the members of the Jinhua Cooperative read this news, their enthusiasm was even higher, and they immediately bought back 3,000 more vegetable seedlings and planted all available land with vegetables. Another time, the Third Team of the Dongxing Cooperative was criticized by the News Station. They immediately held a meeting to discuss it and corrected their shortcomings the next day. Since then, the masses have called the Leap Forward News Station a modern "Bao Gong," believing that its praise and criticism are both very reasonable.

"Little Magpie" and "Woodpecker"

Guo Yusong, an eighteen-year-old member of the Xianfeng Second Cooperative in Suining County, is a popular young painter. Since April of this year, he has painted a total of ninety paintings. These paintings reflect various new things in the cooperative, praise good people and good deeds, or criticize backward phenomena. His paintings have simple compositions and prominent themes, and each painting is accompanied by a clapper rhyme. The members can understand them and like to watch them.

The cooperative opened two painting publications, "Little Magpie" and "Woodpecker." Whenever Guo Yusong creates a new work, it is posted on the painting publications. The headline of "Little Magpie" reads: "My name is Little Magpie, I come every day to report good news." The paintings published in this painting publication are dedicated to praising new people and new things. The headline of "Woodpecker" reads: "My name is Woodpecker, I look for lazy bugs and bad bugs every day." This painting publication often exposes and criticizes various bad people and bad things. Since its launch in late April, these two painting publications have published Guo Yusong's paintings depicting new things in the cooperative, such as "Every Cooperative Has a Factory," "High-Yield Experimental Field," and "Every Household Uses Serving Chopsticks," praised nineteen advanced figures, and criticized six cooperative members. When the criticized members made achievements in production, Guo Yusong would paint pictures to praise them.

Guo Yusong is a young farmer who only attended elementary school for three years. He is very fond of painting. Lai Boguang, the Party branch secretary of the Xianfeng Second Cooperative, discovered his painting talent and asked him to reflect more on the production and life of the members and helped him find painting subjects. Guo Yusong's first painting that shows real people and real things, "Chen Qihai Protects Water and Keeps Watch All Night," praised Chen Qihai's spirit of loving the collective. After this painting was posted, it immediately spread throughout the cooperative. Five outstanding cooperative members appeared in a row to protect the water all night. The members were most afraid of Guo Yusong's critical paintings. Tian Shiyun, a cooperative member who loved to be lazy when working, made up his mind to correct his shortcomings after appearing in a cartoon once and became particularly active in labor. He said to people, "My illness was cured by cartoons."

    文化革命的浪花
    ——四川农村新事
    本报记者　周祖佑
    文化革命的浪潮正在四川农村奔腾澎湃。在这里，不仅出现了千百个出色的歌手，还产生着新型的画家和各种宣传家。在这里，听不完欢乐的歌声，看不尽种种生动的新创造。
  家家有块门板报
    “木门板，家家有，选一块，当报纸；鼓动词，写几首，进出念一遍，思想文化两丰收。”这是南充县新民乡指路碑农业社的社员编的一首赞扬门板报的顺口溜。
    在这个社八百多户社员家里的门板上，快板诗和顺口溜琳琅满目，这家门上写着：“青枝绿叶一树生，大山竹儿根连根，社会主义好远景，社干社员一条心”；那户门上又写着：“小水儿集成海洋，千块竹板盖瓦房，办社要靠勤和俭，饱时莫把饥时忘。”按照当地的中心工作和农事季节，这些门板上的诗句也不断变换。农民们不仅在出工收工时经常朗读这些诗和顺口溜，有的在吃饭时还端上饭碗坐在门口边吃边看。
    门板报是指路碑社的新创造之一。为了向社员进行经常的宣传教育，帮助社员学习文化，这个社的党组织发现，尽量利用社员家的每块门板，就可以办出许多门板报。于是，社里的农民创作组就根据当前生产和工作需要，编写出通俗易懂的鼓动词和快板诗，由各个生产队的宣传员分别把它们写在社员家的门上。宣传员一面抄写，一面向农民讲解门板报上的字句和意义。这样，只需要一个早晨，门板报上的主要宣传内容就可以家喻户晓。前一时期，这个社发动社员利用一切空地栽种堆堆苕（甘薯）时，许多农民怕没有收成，不愿栽种。社里就出了以“红苕是个宝，农人少不了，不要油和盐，也能吃个饱”这首鼓动词为主的一期门板报，宣传员在各户社员门上抄写时，就同大家算细账，讲解种堆堆苕的好处。结果，三天中全社就超额完成了种植堆堆苕的计划。
  田间、院落故事会
    在重庆市北碚区双碑农业社长石耕作区，农民最欢喜的读书形式是田间、院落故事会。他们随时把书带在身边，田间休息和夜晚下工后，大家就聚集在田埂上和院落里，讲书里的故事，交换学习心得。他们谈论的有“保卫延安”等文学作品，也有农业技术读物；青年们最欢喜“红旗飘飘”“毛泽东同志的青年时代”等有关革命传统教育的书籍。
    四十多岁的生产大队长林云良，往往成为故事会的中心人物。他过去是半文盲，现在是社里读书最多的一个。他给大家讲“吕梁英雄传”，讲古典小说。有一次，社员蒋杰养的猪生了病，林云良向蒋杰介绍了“怎样养家畜”一书中医治猪病的药方。蒋杰很快就把这只猪治好了。
    这个耕作区的图书室是1956年建立的。现在，这个图书室每月流通的书籍已从一百多册增加到一千多册。
    现代“包公”
    在射洪县东岳乡中心的地区，竖立着一块长一丈三尺，宽七、八尺的大木牌。大木牌上贴满了这个乡各个农业社的新闻。这里有全乡生产评比竞赛的结果，有新人新事，也有对落后事物的批评。这些新闻的形式也多种多样。有散文，有山歌、民谣。本乡农民都欢喜到这里看看。
    这就是东岳乡的“跃进新闻站”。主编是这个乡的党总支书记刘安生，新闻由各个农业社供给。有一次，跃进新闻站发表了一则表扬进化社第八生产组大量种菜的新闻，这个组每人平均种菜二百五十多窝。进化社的社员看了这则新闻以后，热情更高，立刻又买回三千窝菜秧，把一切可以利用的土地都种上了菜。又一次，东兴社第三组受了新闻站的批评，他们立即开会讨论，第二天就把缺点纠正过来。从此，群众把跃进新闻站称为现代“包公”，认为它表扬、批评都很在理。
    “小喜鹊”和
      “啄木鸟”
    遂宁县先锋二社十八岁的社员郭玉松，是个受人欢迎的小画家。从今年4月以来，他一共画了九十多幅画。这些画都是反映社里各种新鲜事物、表扬好人好事、或者批评落后现象的。他画的画，构图简洁，中心突出，每幅画还配上一首快板诗，社员们看得懂，也都欢喜看。
    社里开办了“小喜鹊”和“啄木鸟”两个画刊。每当郭玉松画出新作品，就贴在画刊上。在“小喜鹊”的刊头写着：“我名小喜鹊，天天来把喜讯报”。在这个画刊里发表的画，专门歌颂新人新事。“啄木鸟”的刊头写着：“我名啄木鸟，天天把懒虫坏虫找”。这个画刊经常揭露和批评各种坏人坏事。从4月下旬创刊以来，这两个画刊发表了郭玉松画的“社社有工厂”“丰产试验田”“户户用公筷”等描绘社里新事物的画，表扬了十九个先进人物，并对六个社员进行了批评。当受批评的社员在生产上作出成绩后，郭玉松就画画表扬他们。
    郭玉松是个只读过三年小学的青年农民。他非常欢喜绘画。先锋二社党分支书记赖伯光发现他绘画的才能后，要他多反映社员的生产和生活，并帮助他找寻绘画题材。郭玉松第一幅表现真人真事的画“陈启海保水守通宵”，表扬陈启海热爱集体的精神。这幅画贴出来后，立刻传遍全社。社里连续出现了五个通宵保水的优秀社员。社员们最怕郭玉松的批评画。干活爱偷懒的社员田世云上了一次漫画后，从此下决心改正缺点，劳动特别积极。他向人说：“我的病叫漫画治好了。”
