    Mutual Support Solves Labor Shortage Difficulties:
    Miao and Han Nationalities in Huayuan County United as Never Before
    (Our Correspondent Long Wenming reports) The Miao and Han farmers in Huayuan County, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan Province, have organized large-scale mutual support and mutual assistance in this year's great leap forward in agricultural production, solving the labor shortage caused by the major reform of the farming system in the county, and bringing the relationship between the two sides into a new stage of unprecedented unity.

    Huayuan County is located in the western part of the Autonomous Prefecture, with high mountains and ridges, and is home to more than 140,000 Miao and Han farmers. All the cultivated land totals 400,000 mu, with a total of more than 80,000 male and female laborers. Most of the Miao farmers live in high and cold mountains, while the Han farmers live in river valley basins. The sowing season in the river valley basins is generally about a month earlier than in the high and cold mountainous areas. This year, inspired by the Party's general line for building socialism, the people of all nationalities in the county are determined to change the poor face of this mountainous area in a short period of time. However, due to the implementation of deep plowing and close planting for rice and deep plowing, wide row, double plant, and close planting for corn this year, and at the same time, applying 1,000 dan of fertilizer per mu, the labor force appeared very tight. Faced with this seemingly unsolvable difficulty, the broad masses of Miao and Han farmers did not bow to the difficulties. Under the leadership of the Huayuan County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in addition to actively reforming tools to solve some of the labor shortage difficulties, they unanimously put forward the slogan of "mountains supporting the plains, and the plains helping the mountains." The Huayuan County Party Committee promptly sent a large number of capable cadres to go deep into various townships and villages to vigorously carry out organizational work, and temporarily stipulated methods such as "exchanging mu for mu, ensuring quality" and "recording work according to quotas, and rewarding after autumn" based on the opinions discussed by various agricultural cooperatives, appropriately resolving the issue of mutual benefit. In mid-May, when the Han areas in the plains were massively rushing to plant early rice, Miao farmers gathered in high and cold mountainous areas such as Jiwei, Paibi, and Malichang immediately selected thousands of rice planting experts, bringing their own close planting tools, food, and luggage, and went down the mountains to support the Han farmers in planting rice. The Han farmers in the river valley basins welcomed the Miao farmers like welcoming relatives, not only making proper arrangements for the lives of the Miao farmers, but also holding meetings of cooperative members to warmly welcome the guests from the remote mountains.

    After the Han areas finished planting rice, the Han farmers immediately organized rice planting teams to go up the mountains. When everyone arrived at the mountain villages, the Miao farmers slaughtered pigs, bought wine, and received the Han brothers with the most respected etiquette of the Miao nationality, blowing horns and setting off firecrackers. There were many dry fields on the mountains, and there were not enough plowing cattle to turn the fields. The Han farmers mobilized about 3,000 head of cattle to help the Miao people rush to plow the dry fields. The Han farmers living in Damushu originally did not have enough plowing cattle for their own use, but when they heard that they were going to support the Miao people in rushing to plow the dry fields, the entire cooperative unanimously decided to "start work early, finish work late, and rush to work at night," and dispatched several strong cattle to go to the deep mountains to help plow the fields. The Han farmers fought hard on the mountains for dozens of days, helping the Miao people rush to plow more than 6,000 mu of dry fields.

    The large-scale organization of mutual support between the Miao and Han farmers in Huayuan County is still continuing. According to incomplete statistics from the county's agricultural department: during the rice planting period alone this year, the Miao and Han farmers in the county mutually supported 34,851 rice planting workers, planted a total of 7,115 mu of rice, rushed to plow more than 6,600 mu of dry fields, and transferred more than 240,000 jin of rice seedlings to support the Miao areas. Due to this socialist national support, the rice planting season in Huayuan County this year was 15 to 30 days earlier than in previous years. At present, the early rice in the county is growing better than any year, and the estimated yield of many fields is more than 1,000 jin per mu. This flower of national unity has been filled with the fruits of friendship and abundance in the local area.

    互相支援解决劳力不足困难
    花垣县苗汉两族空前团结
    本报讯　记者龙文明报道：湖南省湘西土家族苗族自治州花垣县的苗汉族农民，在今年农业生产大跃进中，大规模地组织互相支援，互相帮助，解决了这个县由于实行耕作制度大改革而带来的劳力奇缺的困难，使双方之间的关系也进入了空前团结的新阶段。
    花垣县在自治州的西部，山高岭大，聚居着十四万多苗、汉族农民。全部田土有四十万亩，男女劳力共八万多个。苗族农民大部分居住在高寒山上，汉族农民居住在河谷小坪坝里。河谷小坪坝的播种季节一般都比高寒山区要早一个月左右。今年，在党的建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，全县苗、汉族人民，决心在一个短时期内，改变这个大山区的穷困面貌。但是，由于今年全县的水稻实行深耕密植，包谷实行深耕宽行双株密植，同时，每亩要施肥千担，劳动力显得十分紧张。在这种看来没法解决的困难面前，广大的苗、汉族农民没有向困难低头。他们在中共花垣县委的领导下，除了积极改革工具解决了部分劳力不足的困难外，一致提出“山上支援山下，山下帮助山上”的行动口号。花垣县委及时派出大批得力干部，深入各乡各寨大力进行组织工作，并根据各农业社讨论的意见，暂时规定“以亩换亩，保证质量”、“按定额记工，秋后报酬”等办法，恰当地解决了互利问题。5月中旬，当山下汉族地区正在大规模地抢插早稻的时候，聚居在吉卫、排碧、麻里场等高寒山区的苗族农民，立即选出成千上万的插秧能手，自带密植器、粮食和行李，纷纷下山支援汉族农民插秧。各个河谷小坪坝的汉族农民像迎接亲人一样，不但对苗族农民的生活作了妥善的安排，而且还召开社员大会，热情地欢迎深山远道而来的客人。
    汉族地区插完了秧，汉族农民就立即组织插秧队上山。当大家来到山寨的时候，苗族农民纷纷杀猪、买酒，并用苗族最尊重的礼节吹号鸣炮接待汉族弟兄。山上干田多，翻田的耕牛不够，汉族农民就出动约三千头次耕牛帮助苗族抢犁干田。居住在大木树的汉族农民，本来自己的耕牛就不够用，但当他们一听到要支援苗家抢犁干田，全社一致决定“早出工，晚收工，赶夜工”，抽调出几头强壮大牛赶赴深山帮助犁田。汉族农民在山上前后苦战了几十天，帮助苗族抢犁干田六千多亩。
    花垣县苗汉族农民大规模地组织互相支援还在继续进行。据该县农业部门不完全统计：仅在今年插秧期间，全县苗、汉族农民互相支援的插秧工就有三万四千八百五十一个，共插水稻七千一百一十五亩，抢犁干田六千六百多亩，调动支援苗区的秧苗二十四万多斤。由于这种社会主义的民族大支援，今年花垣县的插秧季节比往年提早了十五到三十天。目前，这个县的早稻长的比那一年都好，许多田亩估产都在一千斤以上。这朵民族团结之花，已在当地结满了友爱丰硕之果。
