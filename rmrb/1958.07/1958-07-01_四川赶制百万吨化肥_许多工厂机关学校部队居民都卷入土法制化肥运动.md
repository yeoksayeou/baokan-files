Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Sichuan Province is universally launching a mass movement to produce fertilizer using indigenous methods. Various localities are striving to utilize local, dispersed resources this year to manufacture one million tons of indigenous fertilizer to guarantee the needs of the current major spring crops and agricultural production this winter and next spring.

Breaking down superstition, daring to think and act, and developing a spirit of socialist originality are the characteristics of this province in developing the fertilizer industry. Currently, the entire province is utilizing all possible fertilizer-producing resources and has successfully trial-produced more than fifty kinds of indigenous fertilizers. In just three to four months, Wanxian Special District has built more than 1,200 fertilizer plants of various sizes. Currently, they have produced more than 5,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, including ammonium sulfate, ammonium bicarbonate, magnesium phosphate fertilizer, potassium sulfate, potassium chloride, potassium nitrate, and nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium mixed fertilizer. This exceeds one and a half times the total amount of fertilizer that the special district transferred in from other places in 1957. Dazhou Special District, focusing on the central task of achieving agricultural abundance, launched a high tide of creating chemical fertilizers throughout the district, demanding that 70,000 tons of indigenous fertilizer be produced this year. The Ren-shi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Kaijiang County, under Dazhou Special District, formed three experimental groups with the district agricultural technology station and other units as the key, to jointly study and cooperate with each other. When manufacturing nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium fertilizer, when there was no nitrate solution, they boiled it themselves; when there was no animal hair for manufacturing ammonium sulfate, they used animal skin, meat, and bones instead. After ten days, they finally produced five kinds of chemical fertilizers. Yibin Special District’s Xingyan Sulfur Factory also created a new method for manufacturing ammonium sulfate. They pumped the sulfuric water from the well, added lime to boil it, extracting sulfur on one hand and manufacturing ammonium sulfate on the other, yielding 1.5 to 2.5 catties of ammonium sulfate per hundred catties of sulfur water.

In addition to some factories and agricultural departments that originally produced fertilizer, currently, all factories, institutions, schools, residents, military units, and commercial departments in Sichuan Province that have the conditions are involved in the movement to manufacture indigenous fertilizer. Some special districts have adopted the method of all-people great collaboration, distributing production tasks on a voluntary basis. For example, for every hundred catties of coal burned, three catties of ammonium sulfate must be produced, and the production of saltpeter must be accompanied by the production of potassium nitrate. The director of the Dazhou Commercial Bureau led four cadres to build a stove in the bureau's food processing factory and used factory waste to produce fertilizer. Without spending a penny, they made ammonium sulfate in just over two hours. Nanbu County, without adding personnel or equipment, utilized existing salt-making stoves to establish 369 small fertilizer plants. Among them, the annual output of potassium-magnesium fertilizer field powder made from waste bittern reaches two million catties, and the annual output of ammonium sulfate made from coal smoke from salt stoves can also reach more than 300,000 catties. The Yibin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also used miscellaneous bones, waste hair, blood meal, and broken leather powder to make ammonium chloride, steamed bone meal, etc. after treatment.

    四川赶制百万吨化肥
    许多工厂机关学校部队居民都卷入土法制化肥运动
    新华社讯　四川省普遍掀起土法生产化肥的群众运动。各地争取今年利用当地分散资源，制造土化肥一百万吨，以保证目前大春作物和今冬明春农业生产的需要。
    破除迷信，敢想敢作，发扬社会主义独创精神，是这个省在发展化肥工业中的特点。现在，全省利用一切可能造肥的资源，试制成功了五十多种土化肥。万县专区在短短的三四个月内，建成了一千二百多个大小化肥厂，目前已生产出硫酸铵、炭酸氢氨、镁磷肥、硫酸钾、氯化钾、硝酸钾和氮磷钾混合肥等化学肥料五千多吨，超过1957年这个专区从外地调进的化肥总量的一倍半。达县专区围绕实现农业丰收的中心，在全区掀起了创造化学肥料的高潮，要求在今年内生产土化肥七万吨。这个专区的中共开江县任市区委以区农业技术站等单位为重点，组成三个试验组，共同研究，互相协作。他们在制造氮磷钾肥时，没有硝水，就自己熬，制造硫酸铵没有动物毛，就用动物的皮肉和骨头来代替，经过十天时间，终于制成了五种化学肥料。宜宾专区兴晏硫磺厂还创造了一种制造硫酸錏的新办法。他们把井下的磺水抽起来，加石灰熬煮，一面取硫磺，一面造硫酸錏，每百斤可得一斤半到两斤半硫酸錏。
    除了一些原来生产化肥的工厂和农业部门以外，目前四川省一切有条件的工厂、机关、学校、居民、部队以及商业部门都卷入了制造土化肥的运动。有的专区采用了全民大协作的方法，在自愿的基础上分配生产任务，如烧煤百斤就要生产硫酸铵三斤，产硝必须同时生产硝酸钾等。达县商业局局长带领四个干部，在这个局的食品加工厂里搭了一个灶，利用工厂废物生产化肥，一文钱未花，在两个多钟点内，就做出了硫酸铵。南部县不添人，不添设备，利用现有生产盐灶建立起三百六十九个小化肥厂，其中利用废盐卤制成的钾镁肥田粉，每年产量达两百万斤，用盐灶的煤烟制造的硫酸铵，每年也可生产三十多万斤。宜宾县供销社用杂骨头、废毛发、血粉、碎皮粉等，经过处理也制成了氯化铵、蒸骨粉等。
