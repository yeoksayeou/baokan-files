    Electric Current Kills Flies and Mosquitoes
    (Our report) A new weapon for eliminating mosquitoes and flies, the "Electric Current Fly and Mosquito Killer," has been put into production by the Tianjin Fifth Gold Electrical Appliance Production Cooperative. When an electric current is applied, the aluminum fence becomes charged with electrons, and the light bulb emits a strong light. Mosquitoes fly toward the light bulb and die upon touching the electrified fence. This mosquito killer can also be used to kill flies during the day by attracting them with fragrant food. The flies will also be electrocuted upon touching the electric fence.

    电流灭蝇灭蚊
    本报讯　一种消灭蚊蝇的新武器“电流灭蝇灭蚊器”已由天津市第五金电器生产合作社投入生产。当它通上电流后，铝制的围栏就布满了电子，灯泡发出强光，蚊子向灯泡飞来，一碰电栏就死。这种灭蚊器在白天时还可以用来灭蝇，可用香味食物招引苍蝇，苍蝇碰上电栏后同样电死。
