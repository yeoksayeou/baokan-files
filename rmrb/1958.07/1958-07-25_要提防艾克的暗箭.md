Beware of Eisenhower's Hidden Arrows
	Ruǎn Yánshùn

The American aggressors are using a combination of soft and hard tactics, employing both coercion and appeasement in the Middle East.

Imperialists, aggressive by nature, are most devoted to military force—accustomed to brandishing clubs at others. Having suffered in Korea, they dare not easily resort to force against major countries like China and North Korea. However, towards what Eisenhower and his ilk consider "small countries" like Lebanon and Iraq, they believe that simply deploying troops would be enough to subdue them without even having to fight. Therefore, as soon as Eisenhower heard about the revolution of the Iraqi people, he hastily sent several thousand troops to Lebanon. Unexpectedly, this not only failed to subdue the Lebanese people, who dared to fight back against the aggressors, but even some pro-Western Lebanese parliamentarians expressed their opposition to the American military's invasion. Not to mention the strong opposition it aroused among people worldwide, even within the imperialist camp, there was an uproar of complaints and accusations. To this day, only Britain has dared to follow Eisenhower's lead in braving the world's anger to send troops to the Middle East. As for his other lackeys, some whom Eisenhower expected to be even more active than Britain, have so far only shouted and cheered from the sidelines, unwilling to risk death by taking the lead.

Political and strategic isolation has made the aggressors feel that they are truly facing a disaster. Relying solely on hard tactics has proven a "dead end." So, while continuing to increase troops and prepare to expand the aggression, they quickly dispatched the veteran schemer Murphy to Lebanon to deploy soft tactics of division and appeasement. This allows us to see Eisenhower's dual approach: on one hand, increasing troops, constantly using low-altitude flights to provoke Lebanese insurgents, firing shots, and sending fifty aircraft to demonstrate over Lebanon, using military force to threaten; on the other hand, saying that the United States does not intend to interfere in Iraq or attack the Lebanese insurgents, to deceive the world and the people of the Middle East, and to alleviate popular opposition. Murphy took the opportunity to conduct extensive activities in Lebanon, not only consulting with American lackeys like Chamoun, but also meeting with opposition leaders and insurgent leaders, carrying out so-called "intermediate mediation," with the aim of using political activities to divide the insurgents and opposition leaders, and to pressure the parliament to elect someone favored by the United States as president, so that the Americans can rule Lebanon in the long term.

There is a Chinese saying, "It's easy to dodge an open spear, but hard to guard against a hidden arrow." Xu Liang, the White Eyebrow from "Little Five Righteousness," was a master of using hidden arrows. When fighting an opponent, if he saw he was losing, he would pretend to kneel before the opponent, kowtowing and begging for mercy. As his head lowered, a hidden arrow called "Tight Arm Low Head Floral Crossbow" would shoot from behind, hitting the opponent's throat and killing him. As the head of the old-line imperialist and an American war criminal, Eisenhower certainly understands this trick even better. So, when his "open spear" cannot solve the problem, he simultaneously uses "hidden arrows," putting on a facade of reconciliation while secretly dividing, so that he can take advantage of the situation and use force again. Murphy is one of Eisenhower's hidden arrows, secretly shooting at the Lebanese insurgents, and the imperialists' other hidden arrows are aimed at Iraq, which people need to be constantly vigilant against.

In fact, the reason why "hidden arrows" are "hard to guard against" is because they are "hidden," making it difficult to see on the surface. Once exposed, they are no longer "hidden," and their effect will be even less than that of "open spears." Yesterday, the People's Daily reported that Murphy's conspiracy in Lebanon had been thwarted, and the Lebanese parliament's meeting scheduled for July 24 to elect a new president has been postponed indefinitely, precisely because many opposition leaders and parliamentarians have gradually seen through Eisenhower's hidden arrows. They stated that elections are meaningless before the American invading forces withdraw from Lebanon, which shows that hidden arrows can be guarded against, the problem lies in raising vigilance and being good at identifying where these hidden arrows are.

    要提防艾克的暗箭
    阮延顺
    美国侵略者正在中东使用软硬兼施、打拉并用的手段。
    侵略成性的帝国主义者，本是最迷信武力的——惯向别人挥舞狼牙大棒。由于它在朝鲜吃到过苦头，已经不敢轻于对中朝这样的大国动武了，但对于在艾克之流的人看来是“小小国家”的黎巴嫩、伊拉克，却还觉得只要开动大兵临境，不用动手，也就会压服了的。所以，当艾克一听说伊拉克人民革命了，便匆匆忙忙派了几千人到黎巴嫩去。不料这一来，黎巴嫩人民不仅不服，而且还敢向这些侵略者还击；而且就连原来是亲西方的一些黎巴嫩议员，也表示要抗议美军的侵略。至于在全世界人民中引起的强烈反对就更不用说，就连帝国主义阵营内部也是舆论哗然，一片埋怨、指责之声。到今天为止，跟着它甘冒世界人民的怒火出兵中东的，也只有一个英国而已。至于它的其他一些鹰犬，在艾克指望比英国更会积极的一些人，至今也只是在一旁呐喊助威，并不肯出头送死的。
    政治上和战略上的孤立，使侵略者感到自己真正面临了灾难，只靠硬的是又“此路不通”了，于是在继续增兵准备扩大侵略的同时，便赶快派老牌阴谋家墨菲到黎巴嫩去，施展分化拉拢的软办法。这样就使我们看到了艾克双管齐下的把戏：一面是增兵，不断用飞机低空飞行向黎巴嫩起义者挑衅，开枪，派五十架飞机在黎巴嫩上空示威等等，用武力进行威胁；一面又说美国不打算干涉伊拉克，不打算进攻黎巴嫩起义军，来欺骗世界和中东人民，缓和人民的反对情绪，而墨菲乘机却暗中在黎巴嫩大肆活动，除了找美国的走狗夏蒙等商谈以外，还找反对党领袖，起义军领袖会谈，进行所谓的“中间调停”，目的是想通过政治活动，分化起义军和反对党领袖，压迫议会选举美国中意的人来当总统，以便美国人长期统治黎巴嫩。
    中国人有句俗语，叫“明枪容易躲，暗箭最难防”，“小五义”上那个白眉毛徐良，就是一个惯用暗箭的能手。他同对方交手，眼看打不过了，便假装跪在对方面前瞌头求饶，头一低，一种叫作“紧臂低头花装弩”的暗箭便从背后射向对手的咽喉，致对手于死命。作为老牌帝国主义头子的美国战争罪犯，当然更懂得这一套。所以当他的“明枪”不能解决问题了的时候，便同时用上了“暗箭”，来一个表面和缓而暗中分化，以便他乘变再用武。墨菲正是艾克的一支暗箭，在那里暗中向着黎巴嫩起义者发射，而帝国主义另外的暗箭还要射向伊拉克去，这是需要人们时时刻刻提防着的。
    其实，“暗箭”的所以“难防”，是因为他“暗”，表面上不容易使人看出。只要一识破，它便再不“暗”了，其作用就会更不如“明枪”的。昨天人民日报载，墨菲在黎巴嫩的阴谋遭到了挫败，黎巴嫩议会原定7月24日举行选举新总统的会议已无限期延期，就是由于许多反对党领袖和议员逐渐识破了艾克的暗箭。他们表示在美国侵略军撤出黎巴嫩前选举没有意义，这就说明着暗箭是可以防住的，问题在于要提高警惕，善于识破这暗箭的所在。
