　　China has been a country rich in fruits and melons since ancient times. As early as the Book of Songs period, there were verses like "eating melons in July" and "reciprocating with plums." During the Three Kingdoms period, Cao Pi wrote to Wu Zhi, "floating sweet melons in clear springs, submerging crimson plums in cold water." From then on, the saying "submerged plums and floating gourds with iced fruit" came into being. To this day, in northern rural areas, it is still common to draw cool well water to chill melons and fruits.

　　Common plum varieties in the north include Yuhuang plum, Jixue plum, and Zhusha plum. Ripe plums have nearly the same sugar content as cherries, more than twice that of apricots; they are particularly rich in vitamin B, about three times that of peaches; and they also contain malic acid, sucrose, calcium salts, phosphate salts, and iron salts. Plums are not only nutritious but also have a sweet and sour taste. Han Yu praised them in his poem "A plate of crisp green fruit recommended in summer." Plums can be enjoyed as iced fruit in summer, or processed into dried plums, plum wine, plum paste, and candied plums.

　　Commonly eaten melons in the north are mainly watermelon and cantaloupe. There are many varieties of watermelon, with shapes ranging from round to oval, skin colors including dark green, light green, off-white, snake-patterned, and mottled. The flesh can be deep red, light red, orange-yellow, or snow-white, and the seeds can be black, brownish-red, yellowish-brown, yellowish-white, or crimson. There are also many varieties of cantaloupe, roughly divided into golden melon, jasper melon, white-skinned melon, mottled melon, pale green melon, muskmelon, and "drunken melon." The flesh can be green or white, with textures ranging from crisp to soft, and a natural sweet fragrance. Watermelon and cantaloupe are both refreshing and thirst-quenching foods in summer, even more refreshing and palatable when chilled with ice or soaked in spring water. The skin and flesh of melons are also wonderful ingredients for cooking. After removing the outer skin and inner pulp, they can be used in cold dishes or made into dried melon, pickled melon, and candied melon slices. The melon pulp can also be used to make delicious fermented soybeans.

　　In China's summer days, besides the crimson plums and green melons praised by the ancients, there are also delicious pineapples, honey peaches, flat peaches, bayberries, autumn apricots, and figs, all of which are excellent summer fruits. Thanks to the development of the food industry, we can enjoy refreshing beverages made from various fruits in the summer.

　　There are also countless wild fruits in the mountainous areas of various regions. In the mountainous areas of Henan and Shaanxi, there is a saying, "Yangtao in July, melon in August" or "Yangtao in July, hawthorn in August," referring to kiwifruit and Akebia fruits. Raspberries and wild berries are also abundant forest resources and can be used as iced fruit in summer.

　　Recently, cucumbers and tomatoes have come onto the market in large quantities. They are inexpensive, delicious, and nutritious. They can be made into various palatable vegetable soups and can also be eaten raw as a substitute for fruit. On summer nights, after work or study, washing and eating a few tomatoes or cucumbers with tap water feels even more flavorful than submerged plums and floating gourds.

    沉李浮瓜吃冰果
    晓东
    我国自古以来便是一个瓜果丰富的国家。早在诗经时代，便有“七月食瓜”和“报之以李”的诗句。三国时代，曹丕给吴质的信上写道“浮甘瓜于清泉，沉朱李于寒水”。自此以后，便有了沉李浮瓜吃冰果的典故。至今北方农村，仍常有汲取井泉凉水，用来冰冷瓜果的。
    北方常见的李子品种有玉黄李、鸡血李、朱砂李等。熟透后的李子，含糖量几乎和樱桃相近，比杏子多一倍以上；含维生素乙特别多，约为桃子的三倍；还含有苹果酸、蔗糖、钙盐、磷盐、铁盐等。李子不仅营养丰富，而且滋味甜酸，韩愈有“冰盘夏荐碧实脆”的赞诗。李子可以当作夏季冰果，也可以作李干、李果酒、李果膏、蜜饯李。
    北方常吃的瓜主要是西瓜和甜瓜。西瓜品种很多，瓜形圆或椭圆，皮色分浓绿、淡绿、二白、蛇纹、花皮等，瓜瓤有浓红、淡红、橙黄、雪白等色，瓜子有乌黑、褐红、黄褐、黄白、赤红等色。甜瓜品种也很多，大致可分为黄金瓜、碧玉瓜、白皮瓜、花皮瓜、淡青瓜、香瓜、醉瓜等，果肉也有青有白，质地有脆有软，带有天然甜香。西瓜和甜瓜都是夏天解渴润喉的清凉食品，冰镇或泉水浸泡后，更觉凉爽可口。瓜类皮肉也是作菜妙品，去掉外皮及内瓤，可作凉菜，也可制成瓜干、酱瓜、糖瓜片，瓜瓤还可制美味酱豆。
    在我国夏天的日子里，除了古人所赞美的朱李碧瓜外，还有美味的菠萝（凤梨）、水蜜桃、扁桃、杨梅、秋杏、无花果等，都是夏天的佳果。由于食品工业的生产发展，我们在夏天可吃到用各种水果当原料作成的清凉饮料。
    各地山区还有说不尽的许多野果。河南、陕西的山区有“七月羊桃八月瓜”或“七月扬桃八月楂”的说法，这是指猕猴桃和木通科的野果。山莓和野莓也是丰富的山林资源，可作夏季的冰果。
    最近大量上市的黄瓜和番茄，价廉味美，营养丰富，既可以作成各种可口的菜蔬汤羹，又可以生食代替水果。夏夜在工作劳动之余或读书学习之后，用自来水洗几个番茄或黄瓜吃一吃，觉得比沉李浮瓜还要有味。
