    Thousand-Ton Ships Trial Run on the Grand Canal

    (Our dispatch) In early July, thousand-ton giant ships sailed into the ancient Grand Canal for the first time. This is China's first experimental voyage to promote modern means of transportation in shallow water channels. This trial run solved many important technical problems in the Grand Canal renovation project, Grand Canal ship manufacturing, and driving technology.

    The Grand Canal, running through the north and south, has a history of two thousand years. The narrowest river bottom is twenty meters wide, the water depth is less than two meters, the river channel is winding, and most of it is silted up. For a long time, only small steam launches and wooden boats could travel in some sections of the river. According to the national plan, after the renovation of the Grand Canal, passenger and cargo ships with modern equipment and a speed of more than 20 kilometers per hour, and large fleets of several thousand tons, will travel the entire route from Hangzhou to Beijing. However, the renovated Grand Canal is still a shallow water channel. Whether giant ships of more than a thousand tons can travel in this shallow water channel, how high the waves are, how great the impact force is, what impact it has on the revetment on both sides, and what measures should be taken for the revetment project are all issues that need to be studied.

    Under the auspices of the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, a working group of 45 people was formed by the Water Transport Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Communications, Shanghai Shipbuilding Research Institute, Ship Design Institute, Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute, Shanghai Jiaotong University, East China Institute of Water Conservancy, Yangtze River Navigation Bureau, and the Grand Canal Engineering Administration Bureau. Using five tugboats and barges to form a fleet, in early July, a trial voyage was conducted on the Grand Canal waterway, generally more than ten kilometers long, from Guazhou to Yangzhou. The trial run basically achieved the expected purpose. It proves that in an artificial channel with a bottom width of 60 meters, a depth of 3.5 meters, and a turning radius of not less than 600 meters, it is entirely possible to navigate modernly equipped ships of 2,000 tons. If the water depth is dug to 4.5 meters, it is also possible to navigate giant ships of 3,000 tons.

    The success of this trial voyage is of great significance for developing waterways of other shallow rivers. (Attached picture)

    Recently, various motorized vessels have been tested for navigation on the Grand Canal near Guazhou. During the experiment, barges of 700 tons, 1,000 tons and 2,000 tons were used to carry out trial voyages using tugboats for the pushing method, side towing method and single-row towing method. At the same time, experiments were also carried out on the sinking of ships, thermal horsepower, and the scouring of the river bank by water waves caused by the movement of motorized ships.

### 大运河试航千吨轮船

    大运河试航千吨轮船
    本报讯　7月初，古老的大运河上第一次驶进了千吨巨轮。这是我国在浅水河道中推行近代化运输工具的第一次试验性航行。这次试航解决了运河改造工程、运河船舶制造和驾驶技术中的许多重要技术问题。
    贯通南北的大运河已有两千年历史。最窄的河底宽二十公尺，水深不到两公尺，河道曲折，大部分淤塞，长期以来，只能在部分河道中行驶小火轮和木船。根据国家的规划，大运河改建后，从杭州到北京，全程都要航行具有现代化设备、每小时航速二十公里以上的客货轮和几千吨的大船队，但是改建后的运河还是一条浅水河道，在这种浅水河道中能不能行驶千吨以上的巨轮，波浪有多高，冲击力有多大，对两岸的护坡有些什么影响，护坡工程要采取什么措施，都是需要研究的问题。
    在交通部大运河工程局的主持下，由交通部水运科学研究所、上海船舶研究所、船舶设计院、南京水利科学研究所、上海造船学院、华东水利学院和长江航务局、运河工程管理局等共同组成一个四十五人的工作组，用五艘拖轮和驳船组成一个船队，7月初在瓜州到扬州一般长达十多公里的运河航道上，进行了试航。试航结果，基本上达到了预期的目的。证明在底宽六十公尺，深三公尺半，曲径半径不小于六百公尺的人工河道里，完全可以行驶两千吨近代装备的轮船，如果水深挖到四点五公尺，还可以行驶三千吨的巨轮。
    这次试航成功，对于开发其他浅水河流的航道具有重大意义。（附图片）
    最近在瓜州附近的大运河上作了各种机动船舶的通航试验。在试验过程中，分别用七百吨、一千吨及二千吨的驳船利用拖轮作了顶推法、旁拖法及一列式牵引法等的试航，同时还作了船舶下沉、热工马力以及机动船行驶时引起的水波对河岸的冲刷等的试验。
