Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 14th: Farmers in Hengyang Prefecture, southern Hunan, have broken with convention and begun large-scale water conservancy projects ahead of schedule. In late June, taking advantage of the break before the early rice harvest, agricultural cooperatives across the prefecture mobilized over 450,000 people daily for a ten-day and night battle, excavating over 110,000 canals of various sizes on the mountainsides. These canals channel river water uphill and connect mountain ponds and reservoirs, creating "long vine bearing melons" style self-flowing irrigation networks, based on natural conditions, each covering one or several townships. Currently, 84% of the prefecture's paddy fields have achieved self-flowing irrigation. During the recent twenty-plus days of drought, the vast majority of paddy fields were irrigated by self-flow, with only 14% relying on waterwheels for drought resistance. It is estimated that the ten-day and night hard work to essentially achieve self-flowing irrigation will save at least 34.5 million waterwheel labor-days this year during the drought. This has greatly helped to solve the labor shortage during the rush harvest, planting, and drought resistance efforts.

The prefecture's initiative to dig canals, divert water, and achieve self-flowing irrigation was proposed because the original water conservancy facilities and irrigation methods were far from meeting the demands of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture. Although the prefecture built over 360,000 water conservancy projects with a single burst of energy last winter and spring, drought resistance capabilities remained low due to the poor water conservancy foundation in the past. Of the prefecture's more than 7 million mu of paddy fields, 14.6% had drought resistance capabilities of less than forty days, and many paddy fields still depended on rain. Through this mountain canal digging, which has transformed the irrigation into self-flow, nearly 3 million mu of paddy fields have become free from the need for waterwheels.

    盘山开渠把山塘和水库串连起来
    衡阳专区形成很多灌溉网
    据新华社长沙14日电　湖南南部衡阳专区的农民，打破常规，提早大修水利。6月下旬，全区各农业社利用早稻收割前的空隙，每天出动四十五万多人，苦战十昼夜，盘山开凿十一万多条大小渠，把河水引上山，把山塘水库串连起来，使全区各地以一乡或几个乡为单位，按自然条件形成一个个的“长藤结瓜”式的自流灌溉网。目前全区有84％的稻田已实现灌溉自流化。在最近二十多天的干旱中，全区绝大部分稻田，都是自流灌溉，只有14％的稻田车水抗旱。据计算，全区苦战十昼夜基本上实现灌溉自流化后，在今年抗旱中至少能节省三千四百五十多万个车水工。对解决抢收抢插和车水抗旱中的劳力不足问题起了很大作用。
    这个专区开渠引水，实现灌溉自流化，是根据原有水利设施和灌溉方法远远不能适应农业大跃进的要求提出来的。去冬今春，全区虽然一鼓作气修了三十六万多处水利工程，但是由于过去水利基础差，抗旱能力仍然很低。全区七百多万亩稻田中，抗旱能力在四十天以下的占14.6％，还有不少稻田仍然是依靠天。通过这次盘山开渠变成自流灌溉，全区有近三百万亩车水田。
