The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, which crosses the Yellow River three times and traverses the desert several times, has been completed five months ahead of schedule.

The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway runs south from Baotou City, the new steel base of the motherland, along the Yellow River, passing through the "Granary of Southern Mongolia," the Hetao Plain. After crossing the Yellow River for the first time at Sanshenggong, it travels through the western desert of the Ordos Plateau and then crosses the Yellow River again. The railway passes through the Zhuozi Mountain-Helan Mountain coalfield centered on Shizuishan, enters the canal-crisscrossed, field-connected, and known as the "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall" Yinchuan Plain, and advances south from Yinchuan City. The railway extends between the Helan Mountains and the Yellow River, passing through the Qingotongxia Water Conservancy Hub and the banks of the Heishan Gorge, both of which are about to be constructed, and through dozens of kilometers of over-saturated soil, entering the Tengger Desert, "where floating sand submerges the ankles and humans and animals fear to tread," south of Zhongwei. The railway crosses the Great Sand Mountain, which is 1,350 meters above sea level and has a relative height of 150 meters, and then winds through the Gobi Desert and the mountains of the Qilian Mountains. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway crosses the Yellow River for the last time at Sangyuan Gorge near Lanzhou, and crosses the Longhai Railway perpendicularly on the south bank of the Yellow River. A three-dimensional overpass was built here, with Baotou-Lanzhou Railway trains passing over the bridge and Longhai Railway trains running under the bridge. Seven kilometers further on, it reaches the terminal station, Lanzhou City. The four major railway lines of Baotou-Lanzhou, Longhai, Lanzhou-Xinjiang, and Lanzhou-Qinghai converge here.

The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway runs across the three provinces (regions) of Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Gansu, with a total length of 1,000 kilometers; more than 500 kilometers are located in sparsely populated areas. The climate varies drastically along the line, and the geology and terrain are complex. The roadbed engineering involves a total of more than 48 million cubic meters of earth and stone excavation and filling, the construction of 1,001 bridges and culverts, and the excavation of 17 tunnels. The total length of the desert traversed by the entire line is 140 kilometers, and millions of cubic meters of sand were excavated. When the line passed through the Dijiatai and Hongtujingzi mountain valleys in the southern section, a large-scale "moving mountains and filling valleys" project was also carried out, with dozens of truckloads of explosives used in a single blast. At the same time, more than ten mountain peaks were leveled and more than ten deep valleys were filled; the sand and gravel used in the largest deep valley could fill 20,000 train cars.

The three Yellow River bridges and the construction of roadbeds in the desert are the key to the entire line project. The largest Sanshenggong Yellow River Bridge is 673 meters long. The main bridge project started in the summer of last year. The railway soldiers of the bridge construction unit fought against floods in 7-8 level winds and persisted in ice construction in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees, conquering the ice floes with explosives and artillery fire. Now, using the technically complex "water jet pile sinking" method, all 408 pipe piles with a total length of 15 kilometers have been driven into the riverbed, and the project is basically completed and will be completed before October 1. While the main bridge was being built, the railway temporary bridge was opened to traffic in April this year.

The Sandaokan Bridge is 340.6 meters long and is located on a riverbank with many reefs and steep water. Within a few meters, the vertical drop is nearly one meter, and the wind and waves are particularly strong, making the project arduous and dangerous. However, the heroic bridge construction unit completed the bridge in just one year, two months ahead of schedule, and opened it to traffic in June this year. The Yellow River arch bridge on Sangyuan Gorge is the arch bridge with the largest span in our country. Standing on the Sangyuan Gorge rock mountain, listening to the Yellow River roaring and watching the bridge arch hanging high above the rapids like a rainbow, the scenery is magnificent.

Building roads in the desert requires overcoming the three major enemies of wind, drought, and heat. From January to September last year, road construction workers in the Tengger Desert encountered 59 sandy areas. If the newly built desert roadbed is slightly neglected in protection, it will be blown away by the wind. When the black wind rises, the wind and sand cover the sky and the sun, turning day into night. In order to overcome the wind and sand, the road construction workers used more than 1,000 camels to transport more than 100,000 cubic meters of pebbles. The roadbed was piled up with sand in the front, and the roadbed was immediately pressed with pebbles in the back. On both sides of the roadbed, the workers built platforms and sand barriers with a total length of dozens of kilometers. In the summer, the desert is as hot as a steamer. Eggs buried in the sand at noon can be cooked in five or six minutes. Construction is carried out in the morning and evening. Water for the desert construction site must be transported from dozens of miles away by water tank trucks or camels.

During the construction process, the staff of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who were responsible for the southern section, and the railway soldiers of the northern section, launched a friendly competition in order to realize the great leap forward in railway construction and to welcome the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, so both sides arrived in Yinchuan five months ahead of schedule.

    三跨黄河数越沙漠
    新华社记者　郭汾祥
    三次跨过黄河、数度越过沙漠的包兰铁路，已经比原计划时间提前五个月建成了。
    包兰铁路从祖国新的钢铁基地——包头市沿黄河南下，通过“漠南粮仓”河套区。它在三盛公首次跨过黄河以后，穿行在鄂尔多斯高原西部沙漠里，然后再跨黄河。铁路经过以石嘴山为中心的桌子山—贺兰山大煤田，进入渠道纵横、阡陌相连、号称“塞上江南”的银川平原，从银川市南进，铁路延伸在贺兰山和黄河之间，经过即将动工的黄河青铜峡水利枢纽和黑山峡岸边，过数十公里的翻浆地带，在中卫以南进入了“浮沙没胫、人兽惮行”的腾格里大沙漠。铁路翻过拔海一千三百五十公尺、相对高度一百五十公尺的大沙山，然后蜿蜒在戈壁滩和祁连山余脉的群山之中。包兰铁路在兰州附近的桑圆峡上最后一次跨过黄河，就在黄河的南岸，同陇海铁路垂直交叉而过。在这里建筑了一座立体跨线桥，包兰铁路的火车在桥上通行，桥下奔驰着陇海铁路的列车。从这里再前进七公里，就到达终点站兰州市。包兰、陇海、兰新、兰青四大铁路干线，就在这里会合。
    包兰铁路横贯内蒙古、宁夏、甘肃三省（区），全长一千公里；有五百多公里处在人烟稀少的地区。沿线气候变化剧烈，地质和地形复杂。路基工程填挖土石方共有四千八百多万方，修筑桥梁、涵洞一千零一座，开凿十七座隧道。全线穿过的沙漠，总长一百四十公里，开挖的沙方有数百万立方。线路通过南段狄家台和红土井子山谷时，还进行了规模浩大的“移山填谷”工程，一次爆破所用的炸药就有几十卡车。同时，还削平了十多座山头，填平了十多个深谷；最大的一条深谷所用的砂石，可以装满两万个火车皮。
    三座黄河大桥和在沙漠上修筑路基，是全线工程的关键所在。最大的三盛公黄河大桥长达六百七十三公尺，正桥工程自从去年夏天开始。铁道兵建桥部队在七、八级大风中和洪水搏斗，在零下三十度的严寒里坚持冰上施工，用炸药和炮火征服了凌汛。现在，已经用技术复杂的“射水沉桩”方法，把总长十五公里的四百零八根管桩打入河底，工程已基本结束，10月1日以前即可竣工。在修建正桥的同时，铁路便桥已在今年4月通车。
    三道坎大桥长三百四十点六公尺，正当礁多水陡的河坎上，数公尺之内，水平落差近一公尺，风浪特大，工程艰险。但是建桥的英雄部队只用一年时间，就提前两个月在今年6月建成通车了。桑圆峡上的黄河大拱桥，是我国跨度最大的拱桥。站在桑圆峡石山上，听黄河怒吼咆哮，看长虹般高挂急流上空的桥拱，景色壮丽。
    在沙漠中筑路，要战胜风、旱、热三大敌人。去年1月至9月，在腾格里沙漠上的筑路工人就碰到了五十九个风沙区。新筑的沙漠路基，只要在防护上稍有疏忽，就会被大风刮得无影无踪。黑风起时，风沙遮天蔽日，白天顿成黑夜。筑路工人为了战胜风沙，用一千多峰骆驼运来十万方以上的卵石。前面刚用沙子把路基堆起，后面马上用卵石把路基压住。在路基的两边，工人们筑起了平台和总长数十公里的防沙栏。到了夏天，沙漠热得像蒸笼，中午把鸡蛋埋在沙里五、六分钟就能烤熟，施工都在早晚。沙漠工地上用水，要从数十里外用水箱车或骆驼运来。
    在施工过程中，担任南段的铁道部第一工程局职工和北段的铁道兵，为了实现铁路建设大跃进和迎接宁夏回族自治区的成立，展开了友谊竞赛，因而双方都比原计划提前五个月到达银川。（附图片）
