    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 16th - The largest water conservancy project in Yunnan Province for developing Erhai Lake has begun construction. The project is scheduled to be completed in two hundred days to ensure irrigation for next year's spring plowing.
    Erhai Lake, located in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture at an altitude of more than 1,900 meters, covers an area of 250 square kilometers and has an average annual storage capacity of 3 billion cubic meters. It is one of the largest plateau lakes in Yunnan. However, the cotton, sugarcane, and rice-producing areas along the lake in Binchuan, Dengchuan, Yongjian, and Weishan counties have suffered from water shortages for irrigation over the years. Now, the four counties along the lake plan to divert 250 million cubic meters of Erhai Lake water to irrigate 470,000 mu of farmland.

    开发洱海
    据新华社昆明16日电　云南省目前规模最大的开发洱海的水利工程已经动工兴建。这个工程计划以二百天的时间全部完成，保证明年春耕灌溉。
    位于大理白族自治州拔海一千九百多公尺的洱海，面积二百五十平方公里，年平均蓄水量三十亿立方公尺，是云南最大的高原湖泊之一。可是沿湖的宾川、邓川、永建、巍山等县棉花、甘蔗和水稻产区，历年却缺水灌溉。现在沿湖四个县计划引用两亿五千万立方公尺洱海的水灌溉四十七万亩农田。
