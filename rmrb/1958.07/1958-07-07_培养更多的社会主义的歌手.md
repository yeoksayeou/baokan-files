Cultivate More Socialist Singers
Yao Di

Good news of the leap forward in industry and agriculture keeps pouring in. Driven by this situation, the vast numbers of amateur artists from the working class and peasantry have responded to the call of the Party Central Committee to dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to create, breaking down superstitions and creating boldly. As a result, tens of thousands of poems, clapper talks, comic dialogues, essays, and scripts from the masses of workers and peasants have emerged across the country. The reports published today about the upsurge of mass literary and artistic creation in Hunan and the large-scale literary and artistic creation by workers in the Tiexi District of Shenyang specifically reflect the thriving atmosphere of literary and artistic creation by the masses of workers and peasants.

Can the working people engage in amateur literary and artistic creation? The answer has been affirmatively confirmed by many facts. However, some people still do not believe that workers and peasants can engage in amateur literary and artistic creation, or, although they have seen the literary and artistic creation of workers and peasants, they hold a "disdainful" attitude, believing that the level is not high. They believe that literary and artistic creation is only for a few people with a certain level of culture and writing ability. Under the control of this thought, they do not care about the amateur literary and artistic creation of workers and peasants, and naturally cannot actively organize and mobilize amateur literary and artistic forces. In this case, amateur literary and artistic creation in some units and departments cannot be well developed. This kind of thinking and situation must be corrected. We have seen that many amateur literary and artistic creations of workers and peasants vividly reflect the heroic spirit of the socialist great leap forward and a high degree of socialist enthusiasm, and many works have a high degree of artistic skill. This shows that workers and peasants are laborers who directly participate in production, and the thoughts and feelings they express when they express their feelings in labor and praise their creations in labor should be the most profound. They created literary and artistic creation, and through their own literary and artistic works, they inspired their labor enthusiasm and promoted the upsurge of production. We need such a mass literary and artistic movement.

In developing the mass amateur literary and artistic creation movement, Party organizations should pay attention to discovering and cultivating amateur literary and artistic writers. We know that amateur literary and artistic writers have a high degree of creative enthusiasm. We should further improve them through specific help, not only culturally, but also politically, to further improve their literary and artistic creation and consolidate their creative enthusiasm. The Party committees of many factories in the Tiexi District of Shenyang City have established central creation guidance groups, and the district has also established amateur literary and artistic creation guidance groups with the participation of the district party secretary. This practice is very good and shows the importance attached to amateur literary and artistic creation. We believe that amateur literary and artistic creation in these places will be further developed.

Cultivating amateur literary and artistic writers is a major task on the current literary and artistic front. We must discover and cultivate more socialist singers in the storm of the cultural revolution.

    培养更多的社会主义的歌手
    姚堤
    工农业跃进的好消息一个接着一个，在这种形势推动下，广大工农文艺爱好者，响应了党中央提出的敢想、敢说、敢作、敢创造的号召，破除迷信，大胆创作。于是，全国各地成千上万的来自工农群众的诗歌、快板、相声、散文、剧本都出现了。今天刊出的湖南出现群众性的文艺创作高潮和沈阳铁西区职工大搞文艺创作的报道，具体地反映了工农群众文艺创作的欣欣向荣气象。
    劳动人民能不能进行业余文艺创作？从许多事实里面已经得到了肯定的答案。可是，有些人仍然不相信工人、农民能进行业余文艺创作，或者虽然看到了工人、农民的文艺创作，却抱着一种“看不起”的态度，认为水平不高。他们认为文艺创作只是具有一定文化水平和写作能力的少数人的事。在这种思想支配下，他们就不关心工人农民的业余文艺创作，自然更不能积极组织和动员业余的文艺创作力量。在这种情况下，在有些单位、有些部门的业余文艺创作，就不能得到很好的发展。这种思想和情况是必须纠正的。我们看到，许多工人、农民的业余文艺创作，生动地反映了社会主义大跃进的豪迈气概，和高度的社会主义热情，而且，许多作品具有高度的艺术技巧。这就说明了，工人、农民是直接参加生产的劳动者，他们发抒自己在劳动中的感受、歌颂自己在劳动中的创造，所表现的思想感情应当是最深刻的。他们创造了文艺创作，又通过自己的文艺作品来鼓舞自己的劳动热情，促进生产的高涨。我们正需要这样的群众性的文艺运动。
    在发展群众性的业余文艺创作运动中，党的组织要注意发现和培养业余文艺作家。我们知道，业余文艺作家具有高度的创作热情。我们应当通过具体帮助，进一步提高他们，不仅是从文化上，而且是从政治上提高他们，来进一步提高他们的文艺创作，巩固他们的创作热情。沈阳市铁西区许多工厂党委成立了中心创作辅导小组，区里也成立了有区委书记参加的业余文艺创作辅导小组。这种做法是很好的，是重视业余文艺创作的表现。我们相信，这些地方的业余文艺创作会得到更进一步的开展。
    培养业余文艺作家，是当前文艺战线上的重大任务。我们要在文化革命的风暴中，发现和培养更多的社会主义的歌手。
