County Party Secretary
By our reporter Zhang Chao

Zhang Runhuai, the Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Yu County, is a man with a motor inside him. He is thirty-nine years old this year, but he is still like a vibrant youth. On the eve of the opening of the county-run railway, we visited him. He had not slept for three full days and nights, but apart from bloodshot eyes, there was no trace of fatigue. Covered in sweat and dust, he would nail the rails one moment and crawl under the train to check and repair it the next. Before we could even speak, he smiled and said, "We originally wanted to try it out, but we didn't expect it to succeed so quickly!"

Zhang Runhuai is a native of Yu County and has loved the mountains since he was a child. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was a militiaman, spending months and years with his comrades in the mountains. The mountains helped them block the enemy's view, allowing them to ambush the enemy cleverly. His feelings for the mountains deepened. He was happy to see the trees growing on the mountains and liked the red and black stones on the mountains. He felt that Yu County was particularly beautiful. A picture of a socialist Yu County often flashed in his mind. He and his comrades said, "Yu County is so good! For socialist construction, we have everything we need." However, some comrades did not share his view. They said, "Even a rabbit looks for a grassy place to poop. These poor mountains are good for blocking bullets, but not for construction!" These discouraging words did not shake Zhang Runhuai's heart. After the liberation of Yu County, Zhang Runhuai was determined to share the joys and sorrows of the people of Yu County and build Yu County well.

In 1953, the first Five-Year Plan began. At this time, Zhang Runhuai had already served as the Secretary of the Yu County Party Committee. The sound of large-scale industrial construction by the state kept him restless. Whenever he had time, he would ride his livestock to survey the mountains; when he went home, he would always bring back stones of various colors and strange brilliance.

Zhang Runhuai always acted with swift and decisive action; he couldn't stand people who walked slowly. However, he did not criticize others, but used his revolutionary courage and pragmatic spirit to influence others. His help in reforming the millennium-old backward iron smelting pots of the Qingcheng Township Iron Industry Cooperative is an example. This backward production method required twenty-eight processes and three days to produce iron. The iron smelting pots were made of dry soil, and the workers had to step on the water and dry soil with their bare feet. In winter, the workers' feet were often bloody, and after many years of stepping, they would become disabled. Zhang Runhuai thought: Although iron can be produced using this method, it is too harmful to people. Every time he thought of the workers stepping on the mud with their feet, he anxiously persuaded the director of the handicraft cooperative to mobilize the workers to reform the old method. However, the director felt that this method had been used for so many years, and he had never heard of any new method that could replace it, so he never discussed it with the workers. Therefore, Zhang Runhuai decided to take the plunge himself. He went to the iron industry cooperative and looked at it from beginning to end, determined to break the old pots. He gathered the technicians and workers together, used the indigenous blast furnace batching method he had just learned, helped the workers to batch the materials, used an old steel pot and a large iron cylinder, set up a round furnace, and used a boiler donkey engine to drive the blower. Immediately, they started smelting. As a result, iron was produced in two hours. The workers admired him and said, "Secretary Zhang is really amazing. He has never smelted iron before, but he has created a new method of smelting iron."

This spring, the central government put forward the call for county-run industries, and the Yu County Party Committee quickly formulated a plan, deciding to build two hundred and thirty-five factories and mines within one year. However, no one in the county knew how to run industries, and there were no ready-made equipment, funds, raw materials, or technical forces. Everyone felt that this was a mysterious and difficult task. At this time, the county party committee decided to send Zhang Runhuai to take charge of running industries. As soon as Zhang Runhuai went there, running industries was no longer mysterious, and the difficulties seemed to disappear. In just over a hundred days, seven hundred and eighty-nine factories and mines were built, all of which were "heavy hitters" such as iron smelting and mining. In early May, the Yuci Prefectural Committee held an experience exchange meeting on running county-run industries. Zhang Runhuai said at the meeting: "There is no trick to running industries, it is just to be bold and not ashamed!" This time we saw the actual situation in Yu County and realized that Zhang Runhuai's boldness and shamelessness are his most valuable experience in running industries. Take the opening of the copper mine as an example. The province started designing and planning it last year, but it had not started construction until March this year. The original plan was to invest 110,000 yuan. Zhang Runhuai said to the masses: "What do we need funds for! Let's start digging with pickaxes first." The masses were afraid to open it randomly because it was a mine to be opened by the province. Zhang Runhuai said: The county party committee is responsible for any problems that arise. When the relevant departments of the province rushed to the news, they had already mined a lot of ore. The comrades in the province felt that they were doing a good job, so they started mining together with them.

The central government proposed: If a county is to be industrialized, it must run six kinds of industries: coal mining, iron smelting, chemical fertilizer, power generation, machinery, and oil refining. Most of the other industries have been established in Yu County, and only the construction of the coal-to-oil plant has encountered difficulties. Some people advocated that industries with difficulties should not be run for the time being, or that the central government and the province should help run them. However, Zhang Runhuai insisted on running it, and advocated that it should be run immediately. He said: "It is better to rely on ourselves than to ask for help. If we push the difficulties upward, where can the higher authorities push them to?" Others said: "But no one knows how to extract oil from coal!" Zhang Runhuai said: "If there is no way, find a way. Ways are all figured out by people!" He visited everywhere with full confidence, wrote letters to old comrades-in-arms who had worked with him in the past, and sent people out to study. Finally, he found out the secret of coal-to-oil. So, he and Song Naicui, the Secretary of the Party Committee of the county coking plant, worked together to study the extraction of oil from indigenous coke ovens. At the beginning, the oil extracted was identified by knowledgeable people as coal tar, which could only be used for paving roads. Zhang Runhuai was not discouraged at all when he heard this judgment. He thought: Coal tar and gasoline are both oil. If we can refine coal tar, we can refine gasoline. He mobilized the workers to build a large indigenous furnace, increased the smelting temperature, and carried out refining. As a result, diesel and gasoline were successfully refined.

This year, because of the large-scale development of industry and water conservancy, the demand for cement is particularly large. Therefore, the county party committee decided to make its own cement and instructed an agricultural cooperative to try it out first. Unexpectedly, the cadres of this agricultural cooperative said that there was no equipment to install cement and asked the county party committee to solve it. Zhang Runhuai was angry when he heard this and said, "Can we still make revolution if we can't overcome these difficulties?" He immediately found a few young men, dug two pools in front of the county party committee, and transported some raw materials for making indigenous cement to try it out himself. Soon, they successfully trial-produced indigenous cement. After many agricultural cooperatives learned about it, they set up their own cement plants.

A year ago, Yu County was still a barren and desolate mountainous area. Now it has become a county full of spring scenery and bustling with activity. As soon as we stepped into Chengguan Town, a suburb of Yu County, we saw the newly built Yu County Iron Factory and Taoyuan Iron Factory facing each other from afar. Not far to the left of the Taoyuan Iron Factory is the first county-run railway in the country that has recently been opened to traffic - the Yu County Railway. Trains pulling coke and wood sped by. We walked through many villages, and new factories and mines were being built in every village. On the roads next to the green farmland, cars, horse-drawn carts, and small handcarts carrying industrial raw materials and various industrial products were lined up in rows. The people of Yu County proudly said, "The speed of our county's industrial development is the best in the world!"

The Yu County Party Committee and Comrade Zhang Runhuai are not satisfied with the existing achievements. In early July, on the day of the opening of the county-run railway, the county party committee held another meeting and formulated a grand plan: to overtake Britain in steel production per capita next year!

How can the people not support such a county party secretary? In Yu County, we heard people talking excitedly about Zhang Runhuai everywhere. People said in unison: "Our Secretary Zhang Runhuai has high ideals and great courage. We are so happy to have such a county party committee to lead us!" (Attached picture)

    县委书记
    本报记者　张超
    中共盂县县委书记张润槐是一个身上带着马达的人。他今年三十九岁了，但还像是朝气勃勃的青年。在县办铁路通车的前夕，我们去访问他，他已经是整整三个昼夜没有睡觉了，但是除了带着血丝的眼睛以外，再看不出有半点倦意。他满头大汗，浑身尘土，一会儿去钉正道轨，一会儿钻到火车底下，检查修整的情况。还没等我们开口，他就笑着说：“我们原先是试试看的，没想到一下试成了！”
    张润槐是盂县本地人，从小就喜爱大山。抗日战争时期，他是民兵，成年累月同伙伴们出没在大山里，大山帮助他们挡住敌人的视线，使他们能够巧妙地伏击敌人，他对山的感情更加深厚了。他见到山上长的树也高兴，见到山上的红石头黑石头也喜欢。他觉得盂县特别美。一个社会主义的盂县的图景经常在他的脑海里闪烁着。他和同伴们说：“盂县多好！建设社会主义，要什么有什么。”但是，有的伙伴的看法却和他不一样。他们说：“兔子拉屎还找个有草的地方呢，这穷山挡枪弹还行，建设可不行！”这些泄气的话一点也没有动摇张润槐的心。盂县解放以后，张润槐决心和盂县人民共甘苦，一定要把盂县建设好。
    1953年，第一个五年计划开始了。这时候，张润槐已经担任中共盂县县委书记。国家大规模工业建设的声音，使他一刻也不能平静。他一有空就骑上牲口，到山里踏看；往家走的时候，总是驮着各色各样奇光异彩的石头回来。
    张润槐办起事来总是雷历风行；他看不惯用缓步走路的人。但是，他并不指责别人，而是用自己的革命胆识和实干精神去影响别人。他帮助清城乡铁业社改革沿用千年的落后的焖铁罐子，就是一个例子。这种落后的生产方法，要经过二十八道工序，焖三天才能出铁。焖铁的罐子是用干土做的，用水和干土的时候，工人要赤着脚踩。冬天里，工人的脚常踩得血淋淋的，踩得年数多了，人就会成残废。张润槐想：用这种方法虽然能生产出铁来，可是太伤人了。他每次想到工人们用脚踩泥的情形，就着急地说服手工业社主任发动工人改革旧办法。但是，这位主任觉得多少年来都是用这种方法生产的，从来没听说过有什么别的新办法可以代替，一直没有和工人们研究。于是，张润槐决定亲自下水。他到铁业社从头到尾看了一遍，决意打破旧罐子。他把技师和工人找到一起，用他刚学到的土高炉配料方法，帮助工人配了料，用一口旧钢锅和一个大铁筒，支起了一个圆炉，用锅驼机带动鼓风机，马上就炼起来。结果，两小时就出了铁。工人们都敬佩地说：“张书记真了不起。他没焖过铁，反倒创造出了新的焖铁方法。”
    今年春天，中央提出了县办工业的号召，盂县县委很快就制定了规划，决定一年内建设二百三十五个厂矿。但是县里没有人懂得怎样办工业，也没有现成的设备、资金、原料和技术力量。大家都觉得这是件神秘莫测、困难重重的事。这时，县委决定派张润槐去挂帅办工业。张润槐一去，办工业不神秘了，困难也好像不见了，仅仅一百多天就建设起了七百八十九个厂矿，而且都是些炼铁、采矿等“重头货”。5月初，榆次地委召开办县工业的经验交流会。张润槐曾在会上说：“办工业没有啥窍门，就是要大胆不怕羞！”我们这次到盂县看见了实际情况，体会到张润槐所说的大胆不怕羞正是他办工业的最宝贵的经验。就拿开铜矿这件事来说吧，省里去年就着手设计、筹划了，但是直到今年3月还没有动工。原来计划要投资十一万元，张润槐对群众说：“要什么资金！我们 先拿镢头去刨起来再说。”群众因为是省里要开的矿，不敢去乱开，张润槐说：开出问题来县委负责。当省里有关部门闻讯赶来的时候，他们已经采出了很多矿石。省里的同志觉得他们开得很好，就和他们一起开采起来。
    中央提出：县里要工业化，就要办采煤、炼铁、化肥、发电、机械、炼油等六种工业。其他工业盂县大部分已经建立起来，只有煤炼油厂的建设发生了困难。有些人主张有困难的工业暂时不办，或者让中央和省来帮助办。但是，张润槐一定要办，而且主张马上就办。他说：“求人不如求己。有困难就往上推，上面又往哪里推呢？”别人说：“可是，煤里怎么能提出油来，谁也不知道呀！”张润槐说：“没办法就找办法，办法都是人想出来的！”他信心十足地到处访问，写信给过去一起工作过的老战友，派人出去学习，终于打听到了煤炼油的秘诀。于是，他就和县炼焦厂党委书记宋乃粹一起动手研究从土焦炉中提油。开始炼出的油，给识货的人一看，说是焦油，只能铺马路用。张润槐听到这个判断，一点也不泄气。他想：焦油，汽油都是油，能炼出焦油就能炼出汽油来。他发动工人砌了一个大土炉子，把冶炼的温度加高，进行炼制。结果，果然把柴油、汽油都炼出来了。
    今年，因为大办工业，大兴水利，水泥的用量特别大。于是，县委决定自己造水泥，并且责成一个农业社先试制。不料，这个农业社的干部说没有安装设备的水泥，要求县委给解决。张润槐听了，生气地说：“这点困难都不能克服，还能革命吗？”他立即找来几个小伙子，在县委会门前挖了两个池子，又运了些制造土水泥的原料来，亲自下手试制。很快，他们就把土水泥试制成功了。很多农业社知道以后，都自己办起了水泥厂。
    一年前，盂县还是个贫瘠而冷落的山区。现在已变得满县春色，热闹非凡。我们一踏进盂县郊区城关镇，就看见新建的盂县铁厂和桃园铁厂遥遥相对。桃园铁厂的左边不远，就是最近刚通车的全国第一条县办铁路——盂县铁路。拉着焦炭、木料的火车飞快地奔驰着。我们走过很多乡村，村村都建设着新的工厂和矿山。傍着绿油油的农田的道路上，装运工业原料和各种工业产品的汽车、马车、小手车，成排成行。盂县人民自豪地说：“我们县发展工业的速度，是世界上第一流的！”
    盂县县委会和张润槐同志，并不满足现有的成绩。7月初，在县办铁路通车的这一天，县委又开会订出了一个宏伟的规划：按人口计算，钢产量明年压倒英国！
    这样的县委书记，人民怎么能不拥护呢？我们在盂县，到处都听到群众在兴奋地谈论着张润槐。人们异口同声地说：“我们的张润槐书记理想高，气魄大。我们有这样的县委来领导，真是太幸福啦！”（附图片）
