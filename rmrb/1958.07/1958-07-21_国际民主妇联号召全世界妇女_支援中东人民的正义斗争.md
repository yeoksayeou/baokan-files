Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 19th: The Secretariat of the Women's International Democratic Federation today issued an open letter here to women's organizations of all countries and women worldwide, calling on them to take immediate action to support the just struggle of the people of Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, and to demand the immediate withdrawal of American and British aggressor troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

    The open letter said that the American and British acts of aggression are interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, an infringement upon the sovereignty and independence of these countries, and a blatant violation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. The serious situation it has created carries the danger of provoking a world war.

    The Women's International Democratic Federation calls on women's organizations of all countries and women worldwide to support the women of Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq who are bravely fighting to defend freedom and national independence, and to take immediate action to jointly urge their respective governments to demand that the United Nations guarantee the right of self-determination of all peoples and take measures to force American and British troops to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, and to strive for the convening of an East-West summit conference to resolve international disputes and halt nuclear weapons testing.

    The Women's International Democratic Federation calls on women of all countries to continue to expand the protest movement against American and British acts of aggression and to persist until the world regains peace and security.

    国际民主妇联号召全世界妇女
    支援中东人民的正义斗争
    新华社柏林19日电  国际民主妇女联合会书记处今天在这里发表了一封写给各国妇女组织和全世界妇女的公开信，号召她们立刻行动起来，支援黎巴嫩、约旦和伊拉克人民的正义斗争，以及要求美英侵略军立刻撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    这封公开信说，美英的侵略行为是对中东各国内政的干涉，是对这些国家主权和独立的侵犯，是对联合国宪章基本原则的悍然破坏。它所造成的严重局势有挑起世界大战的危险。
    国际民主妇女联合会号召各国妇女组织和全世界妇女声援为保卫自由和民族独立而英勇斗争的黎巴嫩、约旦和伊拉克三国妇女，并且立刻行动起来，一致促使她们的本国政府要求联合国保障各国人民的自决权和采取措施迫使美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，争取召开解决国际争端和停止核武器试验的东西方最高级会议。
    国际民主妇女联合会要求各国妇女继续扩大对美英侵略行为的抗议运动，并且坚持下去，直到全世界重新得到和平和安全。
