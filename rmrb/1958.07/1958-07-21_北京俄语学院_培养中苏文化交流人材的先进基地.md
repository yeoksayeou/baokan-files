Beijing Russian Language Institute
—An Advanced Base for Cultivating Sino-Soviet Cultural Exchange Talents

    Beijing Russian Language Institute was founded in 1949 under the direct care of the Party Central Committee. At that time, it was called Beijing Russian Language School. In 1955, it was renamed Beijing Russian Language Institute. Subsequently, the Russian Department of the former Beijing Foreign Languages Institute, the Russian Department of the Renmin University of China, and the Polish and Czech majors of Peking University were incorporated into it. In 1952, a preparatory department for studying in the Soviet Union was added.
    In the early days of its establishment, there were only over a hundred teachers and students, and the facilities were rudimentary. The teaching plans, outlines, textbooks, teaching systems, and even the teachers were all "from scratch." Now it has become a socialist university with more than 300 teachers, more than 2,000 students, and a complete scale. In the past nine years, it has trained more than 2,000 Russian translators and teachers, who are now distributed on various fronts across the country to serve the national construction cause, and has sent a large number of students abroad for further study.
    The Beijing Russian Language Institute now has a Russian Teacher Training and Translation Department, a Polish and Czech Department, and a Preparatory Department for Studying in the Soviet Union. The main courses are political theory and practical language courses such as phonetics, grammar, vocabulary, and translation. In addition, some optional courses necessary for teachers or translators are offered. Teaching has always emphasized the integration of theory with practice, paying attention to cultivating well-rounded talents who can speak, write, listen, and read. Since the "Double-Anti" movement, especially after thoroughly criticizing bourgeois individualism, the enthusiasm of teachers and students in teaching has greatly increased. At the same time, they enthusiastically participated in various work-study programs and voluntary labor, mainly agricultural labor. In addition to establishing a close cooperative relationship with the "Si Ji Qing" Agricultural Cooperative, 60 mu of cultivated land has been reclaimed on campus, which is now full of green and vigorous seedlings, promising a good harvest. In productive labor, the thoughts and feelings of teachers and students are gradually changing. At present, the entire institute is carrying out teaching reforms and formulating leap-forward plans in accordance with the requirements of the general line for socialist construction, preparing to work hard for five years to build the Russian Language Institute into an advanced base for communist foreign language teaching and scientific research.

    北京俄语学院
    ——培养中苏文化交流人材的先进基地
    北京俄语学院是1949年在党中央的直接关怀之下创办起来的。当时称为北京俄文专修学校，1955年改名为北京俄语学院；先后并入了前北京外国语学院俄文部、中国人民大学俄文系和北京大学波兰语、捷克语两个专业，1952年并增设了留苏预备部。
    创办初期，只有师生一百余人，设备简陋，教学计划、大纲、教材、教学制度以至师资等等，都是“从无到有”。而现在已经是一所拥有三百多名教师、二千多名学生、规模完善的社会主义大学了。九年来共培养出俄语翻译、师资二千多人，现分布在全国各个战线上为国家建设事业服务，输送了大批留学生出国深造。
    北京俄语学院现设有俄语师范翻译系、波捷语系和留苏预备部。主要学习政治理论课和语音、语法、词汇、翻译等实际语言课程，另外开设了一些作为师资或翻译所必需的加选课程，教学中一贯强调理论联系实际，注意培养四会（会说、会写、会听、会读）的全面发展的人材。双反以来，尤其是彻底批判了资产阶级个人主义之后，师生们在教学上的积极性大为提高。同时热情地参加了以农业劳动为主的各种勤工俭学活动和义务劳动。除与“四季青”农业社建立起亲密的协作关系外，在院内开垦了耕地六十亩，现在正是满园葱绿、秧苗茁壮，丰收在望。在生产劳动中，师生们的思想感情逐渐在起变化。目前，全院正在根据社会主义建设总路线的要求进行教学改革和制订跃进规划，准备苦战五年，把俄语学院建成为共产主义的外语教学和科学研究的先进基地。
