    A New Contradiction That Needs to Be Resolved

    Qin Xiulan's letter raises a noteworthy new issue: how to break down old family concepts ideologically to facilitate mobilizing the vast female labor force and unleashing their enthusiasm for socialist construction. This issue is increasingly demanding attention not only in cities but also in rural areas.

    The great leap forward in agricultural production urgently requires rural women to participate in production, but they are mostly tied down by household chores such as grinding grain, cooking, and taking care of children, preventing them from going to the fields. This is a contradiction. Furthermore, male laborers go up the mountains or down to the fields at dawn, and breakfast needs to be delivered to them. Each household cooks its own food, with different dishes for each family, resulting in a large pile of pots and pans, making delivery inconvenient. Sending one person from each household is too labor-intensive, while centralized delivery is difficult to carry out. Moreover, some families are earlier, and some are later. Calling out along the village to gather everyone for delivery wastes time. These are all wastes of time and manpower. This is another contradiction. Currently, some single men or families lacking male labor cannot concentrate their efforts on agricultural production like ordinary people because they lack help with household chores, so they have not joined cooperatives and cannot fully unleash their enthusiasm. This is yet another contradiction. All these contradictions are concentrated in the contradiction between the great development of collective production and the small, scattered living units. Expanding the scope of living units and transforming small families into "large families" can resolve this contradiction. For example, replacing family-by-family grinding with centralized grain processing, replacing scattered childcare with collective childcare, and replacing family-by-family cooking with collective canteens can resolve the above three contradictions, enabling more labor to be used in major production areas. Some large agricultural cooperatives have already done this, and it is very popular with the members, which is one example.

    Therefore, I believe Comrade Qin Xiulan's suggestion is very important. The main point is not how to overcome the patriarchal thinking and working style of men, but how to reasonably solve this new problem that has emerged in production relations. To overcome this contradiction, it is necessary to change people's old notions that a small family is the only kind of family. This is an issue that almost everyone has felt (including men), but has not fully recognized. It needs to be discussed and resolved.

### 一个需要解决的新矛盾

    一个需要解决的新矛盾
    秦绣兰的信里提出了一个值得注意的新问题，就是如何从思想上打破旧的家庭观念，以便利把广大的妇女劳动力动员起来，发挥她们建设社会主义的积极作用。这个问题，不仅在城市，即使在农村，也是日渐迫使人们要加以注意的了。
    农业生产的大跃进，迫切需要农村妇女也参加生产，但她们多半被作碾磨，作饭，带孩子等家务事绊住了不能下田，这是一种矛盾；还有，男劳力天刚明就上山或下田了，早饭要送到山上或田里去吃，每户各自作饭，各家饭菜都不一样，盆盆罐罐一大堆，送起饭来很不方便。每户去一人送饭吧，费人力太多，集中起来送又很难携带；而且，你家早些我家晚些，为了送饭，沿村叫喊，很费一些时间才能等齐。这些都是对于时间和人力的浪费。这又是一种矛盾；目前农村中还有一些单身汉，或者缺乏男劳力的家庭，由于没有人帮助家务劳动，不能像一般人一样去集中力量从事农业生产，所以还没有参加合作社，不能充分发挥他们的积极作用，这又是一种矛盾。这种种矛盾又集中表现为集体的生产大发展同小的分散的生活单位的矛盾。如果把生活单位的范围扩大一些，把小家庭变作“大家庭”，就能解决这个矛盾。例如用集中进行米面加工的方法来代替一家一户的作碾磨，用集体的托儿方法，代替家家户户的分散带孩子；用集体食堂，代替一家一户的烧饭，就可以解决上述三种矛盾。能够使很多劳动力用到主要的生产方面去。有些大的农业社里已经这样作了，很受社员欢迎，就是一个例子。
    所以我认为秦绣兰同志的意见很重要，主要还不在于如何克服男子的家长统治的思想作风，而是如何合理的解决生产关系上出现的这个新问题。而要克服这个矛盾，就要改变人们对于小家庭才是家庭的旧有观念。这差不多是人人都已感觉到了（包括男人们在内），而却还没有充分认识了的问题。是需要加以讨论解决的。
