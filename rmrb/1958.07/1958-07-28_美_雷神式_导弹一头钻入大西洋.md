Xinhua News Agency, Cape Canaveral (USA), July 27: Another failure for the U.S. Air Force's "Thor" missile launch. At 6:40 a.m. international standard time on the 26th, a "Thor" intermediate-range missile was launched from Cape Canaveral. Twenty seconds later, the missile suddenly exploded, and a bright orange flash appeared in the sky. The missile body split into two pieces, each with a fiery, smoking tail, and fell into the turbulent waves of the Atlantic Ocean about five miles off the U.S. East Coast.

Fifteen U.S. congressmen were present to observe the launch. The U.S. Air Force initially announced that the launch was "normal," but seventy seconds later, they had to dejectedly say that the missile had exploded, but the cause of the explosion was unknown.

    美“雷神式”导弹一头钻入大西洋
    新华社27日讯 卡纳维拉尔角（美国）消息：美国空军发射的“雷神式”导弹又一次失败。26日国际标准时间六点四十分从卡纳维拉尔角发射台上发出了一枚“雷神式”中程导弹，二十秒钟后，这枚导弹忽然爆炸了，天空出现一阵闪亮的橙色火光，弹身裂成两块，它们各夹着一条火光熊熊、冒着浓烟的尾巴掉到离美国东海岸约五英里的大西洋的惊涛骇浪中去了。
    这次发射时，有十五名美国议员在场参观。美国空军开始时宣布发射情况“正常”，隔了七十秒钟后，他们就不得不丧气地说，这枚导弹爆炸了，但爆炸的原因不明。
