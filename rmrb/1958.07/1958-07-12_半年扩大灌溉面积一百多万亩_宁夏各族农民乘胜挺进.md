Ningxia (by our correspondent) The upsurge in water conservancy construction launched by the Hui and Han farmers in the Ningxia region has expanded the irrigated area by more than 1.12 million mu in the past six months, equivalent to 74% of the area developed for water conservancy in the thousands of years before liberation. Now, farmers of all nationalities are advancing victoriously.

The Ningxia region has sparse rainfall, especially in the arid mountainous areas, where surface water and groundwater are very scarce. Before the upsurge in water conservancy construction this year, many people held the conservative idea of "no water in the mountains," and even in the Yinchuan Plain of the Yellow River irrigation area, there was the argument that "water conservancy has reached its peak." Since the beginning of this year, due to the shattering of this conservative thinking, water conservancy construction has been surging forward.

In the arid mountainous areas, which account for more than half of the region, Hui and Han farmers have been working hard day and night, digging through mountains and cliffs, crossing gullies and ridges, and have transformed more than 530,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land. After two months of hard work, the people of Zhongning County built the "Leap Forward Canal," which can irrigate 100,000 mu of land.

On the Yinchuan Plain along the Yellow River, farmland often could not be guaranteed irrigation in the past during the dry season of the Yellow River. This year, Hui and Han farmers creatively built a "potential rolling dam" on the Yellow River, which can ensure timely and appropriate irrigation of farmland even when the Yellow River is at its driest.

At present, in addition to actively preparing for the construction of the Qingtongxia Yellow River Water Conservancy Project, which is about to begin, the Ningxia region is mainly focusing on diverting water to the mountains in the arid mountainous areas, while comprehensively utilizing the Yellow River tributaries within the territory—Hulu River, Jing River, and Clear Water River—in conjunction with soil and water conservation. More than 20 large and medium-sized reservoirs and dams will be built to form an irrigation network of canals and reservoirs in the mountainous areas, completely changing the arid face of the mountainous areas. In addition to continuing to build drainage and irrigation systems on the plains, a power-lifting irrigation project will also be built in Zhongwei County to accelerate the greening of the Tengger Desert. Many of these projects have already started. (Ma Yuping)

### 半年扩大灌溉面积一百多万亩  宁夏各族农民乘胜挺进

    半年扩大灌溉面积一百多万亩
    宁夏各族农民乘胜挺进
    本报讯　宁夏地区回汉族农民掀起的水利建设高潮，半年来已扩大灌溉面积一百一十二万多亩，相当于解放前几千前来所发展水地面积的74％。现在各族农民正在乘胜挺进。
    宁夏地区雨量稀少，特别是干旱山区地面水和地下水都很缺少。今年水利建设高潮以前，很多人存在着“山区无水论”的保守思想，即是在引黄灌区的银川平原，也有“水利到顶”的论调。从今年以来，由于打破了这种保守思想，水利建设便汹涌澎湃地开展起来了。
    在占全区一半以上的干旱山区，回汉族农民披星戴月，穿山凿壁，跨沟越岭，大干特干，已经使五十三万多亩旱地变成了水地。中宁县人民经过了两个月的苦战，修成了能灌溉十万亩地的“跃进渠”。
    在黄河两岸的银川平原上，过去当黄河枯水时期，农田常常保证不了灌溉；今年回汉族农民创造性的在黄河上修筑了一道“潜力滚水坝”，即是遇到黄河最枯水时，也能保证农田适时适量的灌溉。
    目前，宁夏地区除了积极准备兴修即将开工的青铜峡黄河水利枢纽工程外，在干旱山区主要是引水上山，同时结合水土保持综合利用开发境内的黄河支流——葫芦河、泾河、清水河等。兴修二十多个大、中型水库、水坝，形成山区渠库相连的灌溉网，彻底改变山区干旱面貌。平原上除了继续兴修排灌系统外，还要在中卫县兴修一个电力扬水灌溉工程，加速腾格里沙漠的绿化工作。现在这些工程很多已经动工。　（马玉平）
