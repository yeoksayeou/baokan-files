Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Muslims across the country have been gathering and demonstrating in recent days, angrily condemning the robber-like behavior of US-British imperialism in the Middle East.

The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, home to over four million Muslims, is filled with fervent emotion. Muslims in Urumqi brave the rain to participate in various gatherings, expressing their determination to stand united with Muslims in Arab countries to oppose imperialist aggression and defend world peace. Emin Mahsum, Director of the Islamic Association of the Autonomous Region, said excitedly: We will never allow imperialism to interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries and massacre peaceful people. Islamic figures who have visited Arab countries have also made statements.

Muslims in Lanzhou held a rally on the 18th. In the Ningxia region, where the Hui Autonomous Region is about to be established, thousands of Hui and Han people gathered to denounce the crimes of US-British imperialism. Today, all the Ahongs and Mullas from 21 mosques in Yinchuan City, along with over 10,000 Hui people, participated in the parade and demonstration. Jin Fengshan Ahong, a member of the China Islamic Association in his seventies, also walked spiritedly at the front of the religious contingent. Grand rallies were also held in Xiji County and Yongning County, where Hui people reside in large numbers. Various agricultural cooperatives in Yongning County held discussion meetings overnight on the 18th, and today the entire county held a parade and demonstration of over 10,000 people.

More than 13,000 Muslims in Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, held meetings and demonstrations, strongly protesting the war provocations of US-British imperialism. At a forum held by the City Hui People's Cultural Advancement Association, more than 40 committee members and representatives unanimously supported our government's statement and expressed their full support for the just struggle of the people of Iraq and Lebanon.

One hundred thousand Muslims in Beijing unanimously oppose the US and Britain setting fire in the Middle East. This morning, all the Ahongs and most of the Khalifas in the city participated in the parade. Before this, they had already held two forums and three parades and demonstrations. The Hui residents in the city participated in the all-night demonstration last night in large numbers. The teachers and students of six ethnic groups at the China Islamic Institute were all filled with righteous indignation and took to the streets to demonstrate yesterday without eating dinner.

Forty Muslims from all walks of life in Shanghai held a gathering on the evening of the 18th. Many people said in their speeches: Our more than 30,000 Muslims in Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, love peace and resolutely oppose the war provocations of US-British imperialism. The most excited at the meeting was Jin Quan, a retired veteran employee, who said painfully: Today is July 18, 1958. On July 19, 1949, bullets from US-Chiang airplanes killed my son. Now the US-British imperialists are harming our brothers who believe in Islam in the Middle East. I want to demand this blood debt from the aggressors!

Muslims in Jinan, Shandong Province, gathered in mosques to hold meetings to support the national independence movements of the Arab people. Muslims in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, also gathered until late at night. They angrily stated: The shameless acts of aggression by US-British imperialism are what we Muslims and the people of the whole country resolutely cannot tolerate. (Attached picture)
