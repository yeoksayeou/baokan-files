Backward Areas Can Leap Forward at High Speed
-- Southern Daily Editorial Abstract

During the period of socialist construction, those backward areas that progressed relatively slowly in the past—backward counties, townships, and cooperatives—can completely follow the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, to rapidly change the local natural landscape, catch up with the advanced, and thereby accelerate the cause of socialist construction. The report on Xuwen County proves this point with ironclad facts.

Contrary to the proponents of regional backwardness, the promoters of progress in Xuwen County used the viewpoint and methods of dialectical materialism to make a scientific analysis of the local natural and social conditions, and arrived at correct conclusions. The proponents of regional backwardness in Xuwen County actually used a metaphysical viewpoint to look at the world. They believed that Xuwen County had been dry and prone to disasters since ancient times, with extensive cultivation, low yields, and impoverished people, and asserted that these were all the characteristics of Xuwen County, which were either impossible or very difficult to change. The promoters of progress in this county have a fundamentally different view of objective things compared to the proponents of regional backwardness. Although they also admit that what the proponents of regional backwardness pointed out were facts, they deeply know that the proponents of regional backwardness only see the phenomenon of things, without touching on the essence of things; they only see the negative factors of things, completely obliterating the positive factors that exist simultaneously within things. Therefore, the promoters of progress in this county can emphasize with the revolutionary optimism of communists: the backwardness of Xuwen County is by no means impossible to change, nor can it only be changed slowly, but it is determined that once the key problems are solved, a leap, that is, a qualitative change, can occur. More importantly, the promoters of progress in this county look at the masses of people from the perspective of historical materialism. They understand that the masses of the people are the creators of history and firmly believe that they can liberate themselves. They understand that under the leadership of the Communist Party, after the realization of agricultural cooperativization, the working farmers can exert immense power and create unprecedented miracles. In contrast, the proponents of regional backwardness in this county look at the masses of the people with the eyes of bourgeois overlords—whether they are willing to admit it or not, and whether they are unintentional or not, the fact is exactly so. They repeatedly said that Xuwen farmers are lazy and cannot go all out. Isn't this an insult to the working people? They appear so afraid of difficulties in the face of the great leap forward call put forward by the Party, and they prevent people from leaping forward with fear. This is by no means accidental. However, revolutionary practice is the most ruthless, and it has repeatedly shown that whoever can rely closely on the masses of the people can move forward courageously and be invincible. The promoters of progress in Xuwen County share the fate and breathe the same air as the masses, according to the Party's mass viewpoint and mass line. They consult with the masses when they encounter difficulties, and take deep roots in the masses; therefore, they can complete what the proponents of regional backwardness asserted would never be completed in just half a year. Here, isn't the victorious struggle waged by the promoters of progress and the proponents of regional backwardness in Xuwen County, and the truth revealed in this struggle, of great benefit to the comrades in all backward areas? There are positive factors in any region that can change natural conditions, and the masses of the people in any region are diligent and brave. As long as we, like the promoters of progress in Xuwen County, are good at using materialist dialectics in practical work, find the laws of development of objective things, mobilize all positive factors, overcome negative factors, respect the revolutionary nature and creativity of the masses, and follow the mass line in our work, then why can't other regions do what Xuwen County can do?

We extend warm congratulations to the people of Xuwen, who have created a model for backward areas to strive for advancement, and to the Party organization of Xuwen County that led them forward. We hope that they will guard against arrogance and rashness, hold up the banner of the Great Leap Forward even higher under the guidance of the general line, and strive for even greater victories. We hope that the existing backward areas will learn from Xuwen County and catch up quickly. Now is the season for summer harvesting and planting, and the outcome of this year's national competition is undecided. If the areas with early rice in the middle and lower reaches can achieve a high-speed leap forward like Xuwen County, then what is impossible in leaping to the upper reaches!

    落后地区可以高速度跃进
    ——南方日报社论摘要
    在社会主义建设时期，那些过去进展比较迟缓的落后地区——落后的县、乡和合作社，完全可以按照党所规定的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，迅速地改变当地自然面貌，赶上先进，从而加速社会主义建设事业。徐闻县的报道，用铁的事实证明了这个论点。
    同地区落后论者相反，徐闻县的促进派运用辩证唯物主义的观点和方法，对于当地的自然状况和社会状况作出了科学的分析，得出了正确的结论。徐闻县的地区落后论者们实际上是形而上学的观点去看世界的。他们认为，徐闻县自古以来气候干旱，灾害频繁，耕作粗放，产量很低，人民贫困，并且断言这就是徐闻县的全部特点，而这又是无法改变或者很难改变的。这个县的促进派对于客观事物的看法同地区落后论比较起来，是根本不相同的。虽然，他们也承认地区落后论者所指出的都是事实，但是，他们深知，地区落后论者仅仅看到事物的现象，没有接触到事物的本质，他们仅仅看到事物的消极因素，完全抹煞事物内部同时存在着的积极因素。因此，这个县的促进派就能以共产党人的革命乐观主义精神，强调指出：徐闻县的落后状况，决不是无法改变，也不是只能迟缓地改变，而是断定一旦解决了关键性的问题以后，就可以发生飞跃的也就是质的变化。更加重要的是，这个县的促进派是按照历史唯物论的观点来看待人民群众的。他们懂得人民群众是历史的创造者，深信他们能够自己解放自己。他们懂得在共产党领导下，在实现了农业合作化之后的劳动农民，可以发挥无比巨大的威力，创造前无古人的奇迹。与此相反，这个县的地区落后论者，是用资产阶级老爷的眼光看待人民群众的——不管他们愿意不愿意承认，也不管他们是否出于无意，反正事实正是如此。他们口口声声说徐闻农民是懒惰的，不可能鼓足干劲的，这难道不是对于劳动人民的侮辱吗？他们在党所提出的大跃进的号召的面前，表现得那样害怕困难，并且怀着恐惧的情绪阻止人们跃进，这决不是偶然的。但是，革命的实践是最无情的，它一再表明，谁能够紧紧依靠人民群众，谁就能够一往无前，战无不胜。徐闻县的促进派，根据党的群众观点、群众路线，和群众共命运、同呼吸，他们遇到困难的时候就找群众商量，在群众中扎下深根；因此，他们就能够和群众一起，在短短的半年之内，完成了地区落后论者断言永远无法完成的事情。在这里，徐闻县的促进派和地区落后论者所作的胜利的斗争，和这个斗争中揭示出来的真理，不是可以使一切落后地区的同志们得到重大的教益吗？任何地区都存在着可以改变自然条件的积极因素，任何地区的人民群众都是勤劳勇敢的。只要我们像徐闻县的促进派那样，善于在实际工作中运用唯物辩证法，找到客观事物的发展规律，调动一切积极因素，克服消极因素，尊重群众的革命性和创造性，在工作中走群众路线，那末，徐闻县能够做到的事情，为什么别的地区不能做到呢？
    我们向创造落后地区力争上游的榜样的徐闻人民和带领他们前进的徐闻县的党组织致予热烈的祝贺，希望他们戒骄戒躁，在总路线的指引下更高地举起大跃进的旗帜，争取更伟大的胜利。我们希望现有的落后地区向徐闻县看齐，急起直追。现在正是夏收夏种季节，今年一年的全民竞赛胜负未分，早造处于中游、下游的地区，只要能如徐闻县那样来一个高速度的跃进，那么，一跃而成上游，又有什么不可能呢！
