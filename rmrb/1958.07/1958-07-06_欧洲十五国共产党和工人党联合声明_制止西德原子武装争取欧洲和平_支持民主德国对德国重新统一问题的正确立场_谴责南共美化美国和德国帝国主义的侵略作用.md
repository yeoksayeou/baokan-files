Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 4th. A joint statement by the Communist and Workers' Parties of fifteen European countries on striving for European peace was released here today. At the invitation of the German Communist Party, representatives from the Communist Parties of Belgium, Denmark, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia, as well as representatives from the German Socialist Unity Party, the Polish United Workers' Party, and the Swiss Labour Party, together with representatives from the German Communist Party, held a meeting in Berlin from June 27th to 29th.

The joint statement of the Communist and Workers' Parties of fifteen European countries emphasized that, faced with the new danger in Europe caused by West Germany's atomic armament, it is necessary for the working class and working masses of European countries to further develop activities and engage more effectively in the struggle to safeguard peace. The statement said that if all people of goodwill unite in the struggle or coordinate with each other in action, then they can certainly stop West Germany from becoming a breeding ground for atomic war. The statement said: "Every statement, action, and resistance aimed at opposing German imperialism and militarism is useful and necessary."

The statement then described in detail the re-emergence of West German imperialism and militarism after the war, to the point that today, the Bonn army, under the leadership of former Nazi generals, is engaged in atomic armament, and pointed out that this is precisely the result of the US imperialists' policy of supporting German imperialism. This policy of US imperialism is supported by the ruling groups of Britain, France, and other members of the North Atlantic bloc. US imperialism regards West Germany as its main supporter in implementing its plan to conquer the world, because without West Germany's economic power, territory, and manpower, US imperialism would not be able to provoke war in Europe.

The statement pointed out that the West German ruling group makes no secret of its attempts to invade Democratic Germany and openly raises territorial claims against countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia. Chauvinist agitators are once again advocating the establishment of a "Greater German Reich" that even includes Austria and the French provinces of Alsace-Lorraine. Such a policy of adventurers, given the current balance of world forces, can only be met with complete failure.

The statement then discussed how West German imperialists are increasingly using violence against their own people.

The representatives of the fifteen Communist and Workers' Parties unanimously demanded the restoration of the freedom of the German Communist Party and expressed fraternal solidarity with the Communists who have been severely persecuted in West Germany.

The statement expressed support for the position of the German Democratic Republic, the strong fortress of peace forces in all of Germany, on the question of German reunification: reunification is a matter for the Germans themselves and can only be resolved in the struggle against the policy of war and atomic armament.

The statement said that the Communist and Workers' Parties attending the meeting stated that movements in all countries, regardless of their political tendencies and worldviews, will be welcomed and supported as long as they have the sincerity to guarantee peaceful coexistence, ease international tensions, and eliminate current confrontations through negotiations.

The statement accused the revisionist policies of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia of glorifying the aggressive role of American and German imperialism, thereby acting as an imperialist smokescreen and hindering the awakening of the working class and the masses. Therefore, it is harmful to the struggle for peace. The statement concluded by pointing out that the cooperation of the working class with the broad masses and all those who reject atomic armament and the adventurous policies of US-German imperialism, as well as the peace movement spanning the globe, supported by the peace forces of the great socialist camp, reveals to all the people of Europe the real prospect of defending material and spiritual wealth and guaranteeing peace. The statement said: "Humanity wants peace, and it has all the means and power to defend peace. Peace will surely triumph over war."

    欧洲十五国共产党和工人党联合声明
    制止西德原子武装争取欧洲和平
    支持民主德国对德国重新统一问题的正确立场  谴责南共美化美国和德国帝国主义的侵略作用
    新华社柏林4日电　这里今天公布了欧洲十五国共产党和工人党关于争取欧洲和平的联合声明。应德国共产党的邀请，来自比利时、丹麦、法国、英国、意大利、卢森堡、荷兰、挪威、奥地利、瑞典和捷克斯洛伐克等国的共产党以及德国统一社会党、波兰统一工人党和瑞士劳动党的代表同德国共产党代表一起，在6月27日到29日在柏林举行了会议。
    欧洲十五国共产党和工人党的联合声明强调说，面临着由于西德进行原子武装而在欧洲引起的新危险，欧洲各国工人阶级和劳动群众有必要更进一步开展活动，并且更加有效地从事维护和平的斗争。声明说，如果所有具有善良愿望的人们在斗争中联合起来或者在行动中互相配合，那么他们肯定可以制止把西德变成原子战争的策源地。声明说：“每一个旨在反对德国帝国主义和军国主义的声明、行动和抵抗都是有用的和必要的。”
    声明接着详细叙述了战后西德帝国主义和军国主义重起、以至于今天波恩军队在前纳粹将领领导下从事原子武装的过程，并且指出，这正是美帝国主义者扶植德帝国主义的政策的结果。美帝国主义的这项政策受到英、法两国以及北大西洋集团其他成员国统治集团的支持。美帝国主义把西德看成是它在执行征服世界计划中的主要支持者，因为没有西德的经济力量、领土和人力，美帝国主义就不可能在欧洲挑起战争。
    声明指出，西德统治集团毫不隐瞒它侵略民主德国的企图，并且公开向波、捷等国提出了领土要求。沙文主义煽动家又重新鼓吹成立一个甚至包括奥地利和法国阿尔萨斯—洛林省在内的“大德意志帝国”。这种冒险家的政策在今天这样的世界力量对比下，只能遭到彻底的失败。
    声明接着谈到西德帝国主义者正在越来越多地使用暴力对付本国人民。
    十五国共产党和工人党代表一致要求恢复德国共产党的自由，并且向在西德境内遭到重重迫害的共产党人表示兄弟般的声援。
    声明表示支持全德和平力量的强大堡垒——德意志民主共和国在德国重新统一问题上的立场：重新统一是德国人自己的事情，而且只有在反对战争和原子武装政策的斗争中才能解决。
    声明说，出席会议的共产党和工人党表示，一切国家内的运动，不问它具有怎样的政治倾向和世界观，只要它具有保障和平共处、缓和国际紧张局势和通过谈判来消除当前的对立局面的诚意都会受到欢迎和支持。
    声明指责南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义政策美化了美国和德国帝国主义的侵略作用，从而充当了帝国主义的障眼烟幕，并且妨碍了工人阶级和人民群众觉悟的提高。因此它有害于争取和平的斗争。声明最后指出，工人阶级同广大人民群众和一切拒绝原子武装、拒绝美德帝国主义冒险政策的人们的合作以及在伟大的社会主义阵营的和平力量支持下的遍及全世界范围的和平运动，向全体欧洲人民揭示了保卫物质和精神财富和保障和平的现实远景。声明说：“人类要和平，它拥有一切捍卫和平的手段和力量。和平一定会战胜战争。”
