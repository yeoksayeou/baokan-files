    The Shameful End of Bourgeois Individualist Ambitionists
    Rightists Liu Hongtao and Du Cunxun Expelled from the Party

    This newspaper reports: At the first fifth plenary session of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held from April 7th to 13th, the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Party rightists Liu Hongtao (Standing Committee member of the Provincial Committee, Head of the United Front Department of the Provincial Committee) and Du Cunxun (Alternate Member of the Provincial Committee, Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions) were thoroughly exposed and criticized. As early as the four-level cadre meeting of the Hebei Provincial Committee held from January 18th to February 24th, the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Liu Hongtao and Du Cunxun were centrally exposed. The large number of facts exposed at the meeting showed that Liu Hongtao and Du Cunxun had completely degenerated into agents of the bourgeois rightists within the Party.

    Liu Hongtao was an extremely selfish and self-interested bourgeois individualist. Starting from a despicable pursuit of fame and personal gain, he was long dissatisfied with the Party, eventually embarking on an anti-Party path. In the summer of 1957, when the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, Liu Hongtao and the rightist Wang Baozhen formed a political and ideological alliance, launching a wild offensive against the Party. In March 1957, Wang Baozhen used the water conservancy issue to launch an attack on the Party and the People's Government, denying the tremendous achievements of the Party and the government in water conservancy work over the past few years, and slandering the Party and the government for "wasting" water conservancy funds, causing serious disasters to the people of Hebei. Liu Hongtao even advised Wang Baozhen, attempting to use the water conservancy issue to confuse the public and create chaos in order to achieve his anti-Party and anti-socialist goals. In August 1957, during and after the sixth session of the Hebei Provincial People's Congress, Liu Hongtao, in order to shield Wang Baozhen and cover up his own anti-Party crimes, carried out a series of anti-Party activities: resolutely opposed the thorough criticism of Wang Baozhen at the conference; concealed the materials of Wang Baozhen's anti-Party remarks and actions; used his position as the head of the United Front Department of the Provincial Committee to use threats and play double-dealing tactics to prevent the criticism of Wang Baozhen; and secretly colluded with Wang Baozhen to form an offensive and defensive alliance, attempting to resist to the end.

    The materials exposed at the meeting proved that Du Cunxun was a rightist hidden within the Party and also a sinister bourgeois individualist ambitionist. He viciously opposed the Party's leadership over the workers' movement politically, ideologically, and organizationally. In the summer of 1957, he coordinated with the bourgeois rightists to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, launching a series of malicious attacks on the Party and the government. Du Cunxun, under the guise of safeguarding the interests of the working class, openly fanned the flames, opposed and undermined the Party's leadership over the workers' movement, attacked the principles and guidelines of the socialist workers' movement, and vainfully attempted to split the relationship between the Party and the working class and change the socialist direction. To realize his anti-Party ambitions, Du Cunxun used the unreasonable demands and narrow economic interests of a small number of people to undermine the fundamental interests of the socialist cause of the working class, inciting and deceiving the masses of workers, directing the spearhead of struggle towards the Party, using workers to cause trouble to oppose the Party, in order to realize his personal ambitions and undermine the socialist cause. Du Cunxun also opposed and undermined the people's democratic dictatorship, provoked antagonism between trade unions and the government, obstructed and resisted the implementation of government decrees, attempting to place trade unions above the state power, seriously undermining the pillar role of socialist state trade union organizations in the leadership of the working class. Du Cunxun also distorted the Party's organizational principle of combining collective leadership and individual responsibility. Behind the back of the Provincial Committee, he repeatedly created so-called "anti-sectarian" struggles within the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, attacking those who dared to report problems to the Provincial Committee, and fabricating and spreading rumors, splitting and undermining the Party's democratic centralism.

    At the first fifth plenary session of the Hebei Provincial Committee, a serious struggle was carried out against Liu Hongtao and Du Cunxun. After serious criticism and struggle, Liu Hongtao expressed his willingness to admit his guilt and repent. After criticism and struggle, Du Cunxun remained evasive and resistant, and showed no intention of repentance. The meeting unanimously adopted a decision to expel Liu Hongtao and Du Cunxun from the Party, remove them from all Party positions, and suggested to relevant departments that they be removed from all their administrative positions. The meeting believed that this meeting was another victory for the Hebei Provincial Party organization in the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, and this victory was of extremely important significance for strengthening the Party's unity and unification, maintaining Party discipline, and improving the Party's combat effectiveness.

    资产阶级个人主义野心家的可耻下场
    右派分子刘洪涛杜存训被清除出党
    本报讯　在中共河北省委于4月7日到13日举行的第一届第五次全体会议上，彻底揭发和批判了党内右派分子刘洪涛（省委常委、省委统战部长）、杜存训（省委候补委员、省工会联合会主席）的反党反社会主义罪行。远在1月18日到2月24日河北省委举行的党的四级干部会议上，就集中地揭露了刘洪涛、杜存训的反党反社会主义罪行。会议揭发的大量事实说明，刘洪涛和杜存训已经完全堕落成为资产阶级右派在党内的代理人。
    刘洪涛是一个极端自私自利的资产阶级个人主义者。他从卑鄙的名利观点出发，长期对党不满，以致走上反党的道路。1957年夏季，当资产阶级右派向党发动猖狂进攻的时候，刘洪涛和右派分子王葆真结成政治上、思想上的联盟，向党进行了猖狂的进攻。1957年3月间，王葆真借水利问题向党和人民政府发动了攻击，否认党和政府几年来水利工作的巨大成就，污蔑党和政府“虚掷”水利经费，给河北人民造成了严重的灾害。刘洪涛竟给王葆真出谋划策，企图借水利问题混淆视听，制造混乱，以达到其反党反社会主义的目的。在1957年8月，省人民代表大会第六次会议期间以及会后，刘洪涛为了包庇王葆真，掩盖他自己的反党罪行，进行了一系列的反党活动：坚决反对在大会上对王葆真的彻底批判；隐瞒王葆真的反党言行材料；以省委统战部长身份，使用威胁手段，玩弄两面手法，阻止对王葆真的批判；和王葆真暗中勾结，订立攻守同盟，企图顽抗到底。
    会议揭发的材料证明，杜存训是一个隐藏在党内的右派分子，也是一个阴险的资产阶级个人主义野心家。他从政治上、思想上、组织上恶毒地反对党对工人运动的领导。1957年夏季配合资产阶级右派向党举行猖狂进攻，他对党和政府进行了一系列的恶毒进攻。杜存训打着维护工人阶级利益的招牌，公开煽风点火，反对和破坏党对工人运动的领导，攻击社会主义工人运动的方针路线，妄图分裂党与工人阶级的关系，改变工人运动的社会主义方向。杜存训为了实现他的反党野心，利用少数人的不合理要求和狭隘的经济利益，来破坏工人阶级社会主义事业的根本利益，煽动和欺骗工人群众，把斗争的矛头引向党，利用工人闹事来反对党，以实现其个人野心，破坏社会主义事业。杜存训还反对与破坏人民民主专政，挑拨工会与政府对立，阻挠和抗拒执行政府的法令，企图把工会凌驾于国家政权之上，严重地破坏了社会主义国家工会组织对工人阶级领导的政权的支柱作用。杜存训还歪曲党的集体领导和个人分工负责相结合的组织原则，他背着省委在省工会内部，多次制造所谓“反宗派”斗争，打击敢于向省委反映问题的人，并捏造、散布流言蜚语，分裂和破坏党的民主集中制。
    河北省委第一届第五次全体会议上，对刘洪涛、杜存训进行了严肃的斗争。经过严肃的批判和斗争，刘洪涛表示低头认罪，愿意悔改。杜存训经过批判斗争，仍然狡赖抗拒，始终毫无悔改之意。会议一致通过决定开除刘洪涛、杜存训的党籍，撤销其党内一切职务，并向有关方面建议，撤销他们的一切行政职务。会议认为这次会议是河北省党组织在社会主义道路同资本主义道路斗争中的又一次胜利，这个胜利对于加强党的团结和统一，维护党的纪律，提高党的战斗力，有其极为重要的意义。
