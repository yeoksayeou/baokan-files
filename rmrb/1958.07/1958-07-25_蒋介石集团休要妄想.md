    The Chiang Kai-shek Clique Should Cease Their Wishful Thinking
    While the people of the world are urgently mobilizing to stop the US-British imperialist aggression in the Middle East and save world peace, a group of lackeys fostered by US imperialism are desperately barking, even baring their fangs and claws, striving to cheer for the US imperialist aggression on the one hand, and妄想趁火打劫 taking advantage of the situation to loot on the other. Among these lackeys of US imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is a particularly energetic bunch.
    Since the US invasion of Lebanon, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's President of the Executive Yuan Chen Cheng, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, and even the Chiang gang members who have stolen China's seat in the United Nations have repeatedly come out to express their "full support" for the US aggression against Lebanon, and have openly clamored to "accelerate preparations for a counterattack against the mainland." Some of the Chiang gang's newspapers even bluntly stated that "no matter how the situation develops in the future, this situation cannot but affect our policy, and it is possible that we will take action in the short term." To this end, Chen Cheng specifically emphasized that "attempts will be made to obtain more weapons from the United States," and shamelessly displayed a flattering attitude, saying that unless "Taiwan's military strength is strengthened," "the United States will have to pay a greater price." Chiang Kai-shek convened an emergency meeting on the 17th with Chen Cheng and the deputy head of the puppet Executive Yuan, the foreign minister, and other leaders. On the same day, the puppet Ministry of National Defense ordered the army, navy, and air force to actively prepare for war and cancel officers' and soldiers' vacations. According to a United Press International report, US military officials and diplomats occupying Taiwan are "in constant contact day and night" with the Chiang Kai-shek government, "telling the Kuomintang about the US situation in the Middle East every hour." And the Chiang Kai-shek clique's planes have also stepped up harassment activities over the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong in recent days, airdropping reactionary leaflets and goods. The series of clamorous and harassing activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique mentioned above show that in order to undermine world peace and expand the flames of aggressive war, US imperialism is inciting all its pawns to instigate harassment and carry out provocations from all aspects to cooperate with its aggression in the Middle East.
    Everyone knows that US imperialism has long occupied China's territory of Taiwan in order to use Taiwan as a base for aggressive war to threaten and invade China. And any rash actions of the Chiang Kai-shek clique are inseparable from the instigation and support of the American masters. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's strengthening of harassment activities against the Chinese mainland is precisely the US imperialist attempt to intimidate the Chinese people and distract the Chinese people's strength in supporting the just struggle of the Arab people. However, US imperialism is wrong. The Chinese people have never been intimidated by imperialism! During the Liberation War, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, together with the Chinese people, relied on "millet plus rifles" to defeat the Chiang Kai-shek clique's millions of troops fully supported by US imperialism and drove the Chiang Kai-shek clique and US imperialism out of mainland China. Later, on the Korean battlefield, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean people, defeated the American aggressors. So now, with the Chinese People's Liberation Army unprecedentedly powerful and the Chinese people's consciousness unprecedentedly high, US imperialism's intimidation and provocation will only arouse greater indignation among the Chinese people. The Chinese people will also further realize from this fact that: supporting the Arab people's struggle against US-British imperialism is our own struggle; our victory will also be the victory of the Arab people. The Chinese people will cut off all claws that dare to reach out to our country.
    As for the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is eking out its existence by relying on American guns, it has always dreamed of taking advantage of the chaos in the Third World War and "counterattacking the mainland," and believes that the US imperialist launch of the aggression against Lebanon and the destruction of peace in the Middle East and the world is a good opportunity. This small group of traitors followed behind the American masters, shouting and yelling, wanting to "take action." Going against the Chinese people's desire for peaceful liberation of Taiwan and continuing to engage in traitorous activities is a greater crime against the Chinese people. However, US imperialism, which is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, is facing resolute opposition from the Arab people and the people of the world and is trapped in an extremely isolated predicament, like a clay idol crossing a river, unable to save itself. All the wishful thinking and adventurous rash actions of the Chiang Kai-shek clique can only be completely crushed by the Chinese people, and there can be no other future.
    Taiwan is China's territory, and the Chinese people will never allow US imperialism to continue to use it as a war base for invading our country! The Chiang Kai-shek clique is a criminal who fled from the mainland, and the Chinese people will never allow it to safely act as an accomplice to the tiger! In the struggle against imperialist aggression and supporting the Arab people in their struggle for liberation, the Chinese people are also vigilantly watching the criminal activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique under the wing of US imperialism. All criminals who are obsessed with their errors and are enemies of the motherland and the people will surely not escape the law!

### 蒋介石集团休要妄想

    蒋介石集团休要妄想
    当全世界人民紧急动员起来，制止美英帝国主义侵略中东，挽救世界和平的时候，美帝国主义所豢养的一群走狗，拚命发出吠声，甚至张牙舞爪，一方面竭力为美帝国主义的侵略行为捧场，一方面妄想趁火打劫。这些美帝国主义的走狗之中，蒋介石集团是卖力的一小撮。
    自从美国侵入黎巴嫩以来，蒋介石集团的行政院长陈诚、外交部发言人，以至窃据联合国中我国代表席位的蒋帮人员，都一再出来表白“完全支持”美国侵略黎巴嫩的行动，并且公然叫嚷“加速进行反攻大陆的准备”。蒋帮的有些报纸，甚至露骨地说什么“无论将来的演变如何，这一局势不可能不影响到我们的政策，说不定我们在短期内就要有所行动”。为此，陈诚特别强调了“将设法从美国方面得到更多的武器”，并无耻地摆出一副媚态，说什么除非做到“加强台湾的军事力量”，“否则美国将不能不付出更大的代价”。蒋介石在17日召开了有陈诚和伪行政院副院长、外交部长等少数头目的紧急会议。同日，伪国防部下令陆海空军积极备战，取消官兵休假。据合众国际社消息，美国占领台湾的军事官员和外交人员，同蒋介石集团的政府“整天整夜地保持接触”，“每小时把有关中东形势的美国情况，告诉国民党”。而蒋介石集团的飞机，连日来也加紧向福建、广东等沿海地区上空进行骚扰活动，空投反动传单和物品。上面所举的蒋介石集团一连串的叫嚣和骚扰活动，表明了美帝国主义为了破坏世界和平，扩大侵略战火，正在唆使它的一切爪牙，从各方面策动骚扰，进行挑衅，来配合它在中东的侵略活动。
    谁都知道，美帝国主义长期霸占我国的领土台湾，就是为的把台湾作为侵略战争的基地，据以威胁和进犯我国。而蒋介石集团的任何蠢动，都是离不开美国主子的指使和支持的。蒋介石集团加强对我国大陆的骚扰活动，正是美帝国主义妄想借以恫吓中国人民，分散中国人民支持阿拉伯人民正义斗争的力量。可是，美帝国主义的打算错了。中国人民是从来不曾被帝国主义吓倒过的！在解放战争期间，中国人民解放军同中国人民一起，靠了“小米加步枪”，就打败了美帝国主义全力支持的蒋介石集团几百万军队，把蒋介石集团连同美帝国主义一起赶出了中国大陆。以后，在朝鲜战场上，中国人民派出的志愿军又同朝鲜人民一起，打败了美国侵略者。那么，现在，在中国人民解放军空前强大，中国人民的觉悟空前提高的情况下，美帝国主义的恫吓和挑衅，只会激起中国人民更大的义愤。中国人民并且将从这个事实里进一步认识到：支援阿拉伯人民反对美英帝国主义的斗争，就是我们自己的斗争；我们的胜利，也将是阿拉伯人民的胜利。中国人民将会斩断一切敢于伸向我国的魔爪。
    至于依靠着美国的枪杆而苟延残喘的蒋介石集团，一直就做着在第三次世界大战中趁火打劫、“反攻大陆”的迷梦，对于美帝国主义发动侵略黎巴嫩的战争，破坏中东和全世界和平，以为是良机已到。这一小撮卖国分子跟在美国主子的后面，大叫大嚷，要“有所行动”。逆着中国人民和平解放台湾的愿望，继续干着卖国勾当，这是对中国人民犯下的更大的罪行。但是，外强中干的美帝国主义，正遭到阿拉伯人民和全世界人民的坚决反对而陷于极端孤立的困境，泥菩萨过河，自身难保。蒋介石集团的一切痴心妄想和冒险蠢动，除了被中国人民彻底粉碎以外，不可能有别的前途。
    台湾是我国的领土，中国人民绝不能容许美帝国主义长此据以作为侵犯我国的战争基地！蒋介石集团是从大陆上逃跑的罪犯，中国人民也绝不能容许它安然地为虎作伥！中国人民在反对帝国主义侵略、支援阿拉伯人民争取解放的斗争中，也同时警惕地注视着美帝国主义卵翼下的蒋介石集团的罪恶活动。一切执迷不悟、与祖国和人民为敌的罪犯，一定难逃法网！
