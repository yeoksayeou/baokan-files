    Arab League Defense Treaty
    The "Arab League Defense Treaty," full name "Joint Defense and Economic Cooperation Treaty Between the Arab League States," was signed by the member states of the "Arab League" on April 13, 1950, and came into effect in April 1952. Libya and Sudan are also bound by this treaty after joining the Arab League.
      The "Arab League Defense Treaty" includes thirteen articles (with military annexes). Article 2 of the treaty stipulates that "The Contracting States consider any act of armed aggression against any one or more of them or against their armed forces to be an act against all of them. Therefore, in exercise of the inherent right of self-defense, and in guaranteeing to come without delay to the aid of the State or States so attacked, individually and collectively, and in immediately taking, individually and collectively, all effective steps, including the use of armed force, to repel the aggression and restore peace and security."
