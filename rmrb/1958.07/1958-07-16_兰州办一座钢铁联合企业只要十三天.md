Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Dispatch – The workers of the Lanzhou Petroleum and Chemical Machinery Plant built a small steel and iron complex in thirteen days and started open-air production on the 5th of this month.

This small steel and iron complex has a small blast furnace and cupola for ironmaking, a Bessemer converter for steelmaking, and rolling equipment. According to its design capacity, it can produce three tons of iron and half a ton of steel per hour.

This small steel and iron complex was built by the workers by breaking with convention and adopting a method of simultaneous cross-implementation of design, construction, and installation. The equipment was installed first for open-air production, and then the plant building was constructed. Therefore, it only took thirteen days from design to production. At the same time, most of the equipment they manufactured was made of old and waste materials, plus the support of brother factories, so the investment was half of that of a regular construction of the same steel and iron complex.

The workers of the Lanzhou Petroleum and Chemical Machinery Plant had no experience in building steel and iron complexes, but they had soaring enthusiasm. Technician Zhang Wuting had been a riveter and welder for over twenty years. When he heard that the Xinlong Foundry was building an indigenous blast furnace, he ran to learn about it for a day, and it took him only eight or nine days to build a small blast furnace. The designers of the non-standard equipment design section of the factory only did general designs of mining machinery, machine tools, etc. In designing cupolas, Bessemer converters, and rolling mills this time, they temporarily looked for reference materials and read books, and completed the design task after only two days and nights of hard work. Many difficulties encountered in manufacturing equipment were also overcome by the workers one by one. (Attached picture)

### 兰州办一座钢铁联合企业只要十三天

    兰州办一座钢铁联合企业只要十三天
    据新华社兰州电　兰州石油化工机器厂职工十三天办起一座小型钢铁联合企业，从本月5日起开始露天生产。
    这个小型钢铁联合企业，拥有炼铁的小高炉、冲天炉，炼钢的贝氏转炉，以及轧钢设备。按设计能力，它每小时能出铁三吨、出钢半吨。
    这座小型钢铁联合企业是职工们打破常规采用设计、施工和安装同时交叉进行的办法，先施工安装好设备，在露天生产，然后再建厂房，因而从设计到生产只花了十三天的时间。同时，他们制造的设备大都是利用的旧料和废料，加上兄弟厂的支援，因而投资比一般正规建设的同等钢铁联合企业节省一半。
    兰州石油化工机器厂职工对建设钢铁联合企业毫无经验，但是，他们有冲天的干劲。技术师张午廷是干了二十来年的铆焊工。他听说新陇翻砂厂正在建设土高炉，就跑去学习了一天，回来只用八、九天的时间便建成了一座小高炉。厂里非标准设备设计科的设计人员，过去只搞矿山机械、机床等一般设计；这次在设计冲天炉、贝氏转炉和轧钢机的时候，临时寻找参考材料、翻阅书籍，只苦战了两天两夜便完成了设计任务。在制造设备方面所遇到的很多困难，也都被职工一一克服了。（附图片）
