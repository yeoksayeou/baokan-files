    Everyone Write
    Zhang Yingchuan, Tsinghua University

    The "An Idea" by Comrade Zhou Fang, published in the People's Daily on July 7th, is very good, and I raise both hands in support. But I think it is far from enough to rely solely on poets and writers to write.

    At present, the products created by the masses that exceed international standards are not hundreds, but thousands, tens of thousands, and are constantly increasing at a rate of "one day equals twenty years." How can a few writers and poets complete this task? They have not directly participated in the trial production, and have not fought alongside the heroes who created miracles. Even if they spend a lot of time, it is difficult to understand deeply, and it is difficult to create good poems.

    I think the best way is to mobilize everyone to write, let the heroes who created these miracles write themselves, let the amateur poetry lovers around them who directly participate in production write, of course, poets and writers can also write, and should also write.

    In our school alone, students trial-produced more than 100 kinds of products during the three-month work-study program, of which dozens have reached or exceeded international standards. It is conceivable how many there are nationwide, so it is not enough to rely on the People's Daily supplement to publish these poems. I suggest that national literary publications all open such a column. A better way, I wonder if we can insert these poems in advertising paintings, let them spread throughout the cities and countryside of the motherland, directly inspiring people's enthusiasm for production, and can promote the national people to liberate their minds and better exert their energy.

    大家来写
    清华大学　张应传
    人民日报7月7日刊登的周方同志的“一个想法”很好，我举起双手赞成。但我认为光靠诗人、作家来写是远远不够的。
    目前，群众创造出来的超过国际水平的产品已不是数以百计，而是数以千计、数以万计了，而且还在以“一天等于二十年”的速度不断增加。光靠一些作家、诗人怎能完成这个任务呢？他们没有直接参加试制，没有和创造奇迹的英雄们共同战斗，即使花了不少时间也很难了解得很深入，要创作出好的诗来就困难了。
    我认为最好的办法还是发动大家来写，让创造这些奇迹的英雄们自己来写，让他们周围的直接参加生产的业余诗歌爱好者来写，当然诗人、作家也可以写，也应当写。
    光我们学校在三个月勤工俭学的过程中同学们自己就试制出了一百多种产品，其中有好几十种就达到或超过了国际水平，全国范围内有多少那就可想而知了，因而光靠人民日报副刊来刊登这些诗是不够的。我建议全国文艺刊物都开辟这样一个专栏来。更好的方法，我想是否可以把这些诗插在广告画中，让他遍布祖国的城市和农村，直接鼓舞人们的生产热情，而且能促进全国人民解放思想，更好地发挥干劲。
