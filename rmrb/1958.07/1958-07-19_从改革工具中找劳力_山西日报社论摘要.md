Find Labor from Tool Reform
Abstract of Shanxi Daily Editorial
    Labor shortage is a major problem in the current all-round leap forward of various tasks.
    How to solve this problem? There are different attitudes and different approaches.
    Some people who hold a "tension theory," when faced with the situation of much farm work and little labor, do not take active and effective measures to solve the problem, but instead shout "tension" in vain and ask for outside assistance; they even advocate reducing production tasks and lowering the quality of farm work. Of course, there are not many people like this, but according to their ideas and practices, agricultural production cannot make an all-round great leap forward.
    In many areas, although many specific measures have been taken to solve the problem of labor shortage, such as organizing busy farming season nurseries and busy farming season canteens, and mobilizing women to participate in production; all of these are good ways to solve labor difficulties and should be continued, but they cannot solve the fundamental problem.
    So, what is the fundamental way to solve the problem of labor shortage? The answer is: find labor from tool reform. The news that Xiaoyu Township in Linfen fought hard for five days and nights to realize the mechanization of transportation, inter-tillage, and stem coating vividly illustrates this problem. The contradiction between farm work and labor in Xiaoyu Township can represent the problems of the vast majority of regions; the debate in this township on how to solve the problem of labor shortage is also quite universal. How to solve such a problem? Under the enlightenment of the report of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the party organization of Xiaoyu Township finally found the correct way and achieved great results.
    The reason why the problem of Xiaoyu Township was solved so well is that: the work of tool reform was placed on the shoulders of the broad masses, making tool reform a mass and conscious movement; the tool reform movement was closely combined with the current agricultural activities.
    We know that where there is production, where there is labor, there is a demand for technological innovation. But how to make this demand conscious, the leader's responsibility lies in enlightening and guiding the masses, so that the masses can truly realize the important significance of tool reform from the depths of their minds. The party organization of Xiaoyu Township grasped the contradiction between work tasks and labor, launched a great airing of views and a great debate among the masses, presented the difficulties and various ways to solve the difficulties, and as a result, the masses reached a consensus and unified their thinking, thus making the tool reform movement a truly vigorous mass movement. At the same time, in the tool reform, they also closely combined the current agricultural activities such as inter-tillage and pest control, so that the reformed tools can generate benefits immediately, which further inspires and encourages the masses' enthusiasm for innovating tools. As a result, labor efficiency has increased by twenty-five times, and the problem of labor shortage has been easily solved.
    We hope that all regions with labor shortages that have not yet found effective solutions will use the experience of Xiaoyu Township to check the tool reform and promotion work in their own regions; it is necessary to check whether the local tool reform has truly become a mass movement, whether the created and reformed tools are applicable and have been widely promoted.... As long as the tool reform movement is grasped, the problems of labor shortage and labor tension can be fundamentally solved.

    从改革工具中找劳力
    山西日报社论摘要
    劳力不足，是当前各项工作齐跃进中的一个主要问题。
    这个问题如何解决呢？有不同的态度和不同的做法。
    一部分持“紧张论”的人，他们面对着农活多、劳力少的情况，不是采取积极的有效的措施去解决问题，而是在那里空喊“紧张”，要求外援；甚至主张减缩生产任务，降低农活的质量。这种人，当然不是大量的，但依照他们的想法和做法，农业生产就不可能全面大跃进。
    有不少的地区，在解决劳力不足的问题上，虽然也采取了许多具体措施，如：组织农忙托儿所、农忙食堂，发动妇女参加生产；改善劳动组织、提高劳动效率；所有这些，都是解决劳力困难的好办法，应继续坚持下去，但却不能解决根本问题。
    那末，解决劳力不足问题的根本办法是什么呢？答曰：从改革工具中找劳力。临汾小榆乡苦战五昼夜实现运输、中耕、涂茎土机械化的消息，生动地说明了这个问题。小榆乡在农活和劳力问题上所存在的矛盾，可以代表绝大多数地区的问题；这个乡在如何解决劳力不足问题上的争论，也带有相当的普遍性。面对着这样一个问题如何解决？小榆乡的党组织，在党的八大二次会议的报告启示下，终于找到了正确的途径，并且获得巨大成果。
    小榆乡的这个问题所以解决的好，这是因为：把农具改革工作放在广大群众的身上，使农具改革成为群众性的自觉的运动；把农具改革运动和当前的农事活动紧紧地结合起来。
    我们知道，那里有生产，那里有劳动，那里就有技术革新的要求。但如何使这种要求带有自觉性，领导者的责任，就在于启发、诱导群众，使群众从思想深处真正认识改革工具的重要意义。小榆乡的党组织，抓住了工作任务和劳力的矛盾，在群众中展开大鸣大放大辩论，摆出困难所在和解决困难的种种办法，结果使群众认识取得一致，思想统一，因而使工具改革运动，真正成为轰轰烈烈的群众运动。同时，在工具改革中，他们又紧紧结合了当前的中耕、除虫等等农事活动，使改制的工具，眼下就发生效益，这样，就更加启发和鼓舞了群众革新工具的积极性。结果，劳动效率提高了二十五倍，劳力不足的问题迎刃而解。
    我们希望所有存在劳力不足，而又没有找到有效的解决办法的地区，都应用小榆乡的经验，对照来检查一下自己地区的工具改革和推广工作；要检查当地的工具改革是否真正成为群众运动，所创造、改制的工具是否适用和已经大量推广……。只要把工具改革运动抓起来，什么劳力不足、劳力紧张的问题，就可以得到根本上的解决。
