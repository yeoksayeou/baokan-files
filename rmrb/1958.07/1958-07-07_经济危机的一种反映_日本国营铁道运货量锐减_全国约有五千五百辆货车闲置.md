    A Reflection of the Economic Crisis
    Japan's National Railway Freight Volume Plummets
    Approximately 5,500 Freight Cars Nationwide Lie Idle
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - Japan's National Railway's freight volume has recently decreased significantly. This situation is a reflection of the economic crisis in Japan.
    According to Kyodo News, the freight volume of Japan's National Railway for the three months of April, May, and June this year was 40.49 million tons, a decrease of 4.17 million tons compared to the same period last year. Consequently, the National Railway Company incurred a loss of 3 billion yen during this period.
    The main reason for the substantial decrease in the freight volume of the National Railway is the reduction in the transportation volume of bulk commodities such as timber, ore, and coal. Currently, approximately 5,500 freight cars are parked empty at major freight stations across the country. This situation is expected to continue.

    经济危机的一种反映
    日本国营铁道运货量锐减
    全国约有五千五百辆货车闲置
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本国营铁道的货运量最近以来大大减少。这种情况是日本经济危机的一种反映。
    据共同社报道，日本国营铁道今年4、5、6三个月的货运量是四千零四十九万吨，比去年同期减少了四百一十七万吨，因此国营铁道公司在这一时期亏本达三十亿日元。
    国营铁道的货运量大大减少的原因是大宗的木材、矿石、煤等货物的运输量减少了。目前，在全国的主要货运车站上，约有五千五百辆货车停在那里空着。这种情况估计还将继续下去。
