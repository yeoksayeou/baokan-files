    AP Reporter Reports
    Jordanian Puppet Dynasty Tottering
    Possibility of Revolution Increasing
    (Xinhua News Agency, July 21st) An Associated Press dispatch from Amman, Jordan, on the 19th admitted that the Iraqi revolution "dealt a heavy blow to Jordan." Under the influence of the successful Iraqi revolution, the possibility of revolutionary flames igniting in Jordan is increasing.
    The dispatch said that despite the emergency plans of the United States and Britain to provide military and economic "aid" to Jordan, King Hussein of Jordan "is clearly in deep trouble." His palace and the residence of Prime Minister Rifai are heavily guarded by carefully selected troops and fully armed armored vehicles.
    The dispatch stated that demonstrations have already broken out in cities such as Nablus, Tulkarm, and Ramallah on the West Bank of the Jordan River. The Associated Press acknowledged that this is "just the beginning" and that larger-scale events against the Hussein dynasty are likely to erupt soon.
    The dispatch also reflected the great anger of the people of Amman towards the imperialists. It said that they have begun shooting at British military aircraft flying over Amman from rooftops. The Associated Press reporter believes this is "a shadow of things that may happen."
    The dispatch said that the economy of the Hussein regime, which relies almost entirely on imperialist subsidies, has experienced serious disruptions since the Iraqi revolution. From the evening of the 13th to the 18th, it did not receive a single drop of oil. Due to the lack of fuel, cars were put in garages, taxi fares and gasoline prices soared, and electricity supply was interrupted in some areas. At the same time, oil is the driving force for transporting water from reservoirs several miles away to Amman, Jerusalem, and other cities. Unless oil continues to be supplied, these cities will face water shortages. The Associated Press reporter worriedly said, "Water shortages will ignite the flames of revolution."

    美联社记者报道
    约旦傀儡王朝摇摇欲坠
    爆发革命的可能性在增大
    据新华社21日讯  美联社记者19日从约旦首都安曼发出的一则消息承认，伊拉克的革命“重重地打击了约旦”。在伊拉克革命成功的影响下，在约旦燃起革命的怒火的可能性正在增大中。
    消息说，尽管有美英两国向约旦提供军事和经济“援助”的紧急计划，约旦的侯赛因国王“显然陷入了重重的困难”。他的王宫和首相里法伊的住宅都派了精选部队和枪炮齐全的装甲车森严戒备。
    消息说，在约旦河西岸的纳布鲁斯、图尔卡姆和拉马拉等城市，已经爆发了示威。美联社承认，这还是“刚刚开始”，很可能不久将爆发更大规模的反对侯赛因王朝的事件。
    消息还反映了安曼人民对帝国主义者的极大的愤怒。它说，他们已经开始在屋顶上向飞过安曼的英军飞机开枪射击。美联社记者认为，这是“可能发生的事情的阴影”。
    消息说，差不多完全仰靠帝国主义的津贴金过日子的侯赛因政权的经济，在伊拉克革命以后发生了严重的失调。从13日晚上到18日，它没有得到一滴石油，由于缺乏燃料，汽车都放进车库中去了，出租汽车车费和汽油价格飞涨，有些地区的电力供应也因此中断。同时，石油是把水从好几英里以外的水库运到安曼、耶路撒冷和其他城市的动力来源，除非石油继续供应，这些城市就会发生水荒。美联社记者担心地说，“水荒会引起革命的怒火。”
