    Understanding the Illness, Understanding the Human Touch
    ——Remembering the Revolutionary Creation of "Home Hospital Beds" in Tianjin
    By our reporters Zhu Zemin and Hong Minsheng
    The First "Home Hospital Bed"
    Three months ago, Zhao Cuilan, a female patient with pulmonary tuberculosis, came to the Tangjiakou Clinic in Tianjin. She had been running a high fever for several days, had no appetite, and had been emaciated by the disease, needing daily injections of streptomycin. Of course, it would be best to treat her in the hospital, but the hospital had no empty beds. Her husband had to take leave twice a day to carry her to the clinic for injections. Wearing a cotton-padded coat and covered with a thick quilt, she leaned on her husband, panting for breath as soon as she arrived at the clinic. After the injection, her husband carried her home again, and she couldn't move for hours lying in bed, not even having the strength to drink water. In Zhao Cuilan's own words, "At that time, I was only a breath away from being dead."
    Zhao Cuilan was carried back and forth by her husband every day for half a month, but not only did her condition not improve, but it also worsened.
    The doctors and nurses at the clinic saw the patient's difficulties and pain. At that time, they were discussing opening hospital beds in patients' homes, but many people disagreed. Some said that the Tangjiakou street had more than 20,000 residents, and how could the clinic's four doctors manage it; some were afraid that their skills were low and they couldn't manage the hospital beds well; some were afraid of being tired, going to patients' homes in all kinds of weather; some simply said, "This is simply nonsense." While they were arguing, they saw Zhao Cuilan's specific situation, and a struggle unfolded in their minds, and they felt blamed. As Feng Wugong, the director of the clinic, said: "Relieving the patient's pain is the doctor's duty, can't we find a way to relieve Zhao Cuilan's pain?" After everyone did the calculations, they thought that there was no problem in opening ten "home hospital beds" under the existing manpower conditions, and the clinic could also ask the district-level hospital for assistance and guidance if the technology was low. So many people suggested: "Let's open the first 'home hospital bed' in Zhao Cuilan's home and try it!"
    From then on, Zhao Cuilan no longer had to be carried back and forth by her husband. Every day, doctors and nurses went to her home to take her temperature, give her injections, and check the ward, and sometimes they also helped her buy things and cook. Zhao Cuilan was at ease and able to recuperate at home, and her condition quickly improved, and her appetite gradually increased. She recovered in just over a month. When she was "discharged" from the hospital, she had gained ten *jin* in weight!

    The Many Benefits of "Home Hospital Beds"
    From the different patients we interviewed, we heard about the various benefits that "home hospital beds" bring to patients.
    As soon as we entered the home of Liu Menghai, a patient suffering from tuberculous lymphadenitis and spinal tuberculosis, we felt a sense of cleanliness and beauty. This "ward" may be simpler in terms of equipment than a hospital ward, but this does not hinder the patient's treatment. In the middle of his "ward" is a wooden bed, which is the hospital bed, with a white sheet and a straw mat. The spittoon is covered with a lid, and the room is spotless. Even the medicine bottles on the table are clean. It turns out that under the guidance of doctors and nurses, the patient and family members have learned about hygiene and nursing knowledge, and the "ward" is tidy. Even Liu Menghai's children have had BCG checks, so that the patient's recuperation at home is almost the same as in the hospital.
    Jiang Jiaoqing, a tuberculosis patient, is another case. She has five children. She was originally in the hospital for treatment, but she was always thinking about her five children at home, couldn't sleep, and couldn't eat well, so she had to return home. Now that she is in a "home hospital bed," she can see her children at any time, and she can also cook some delicious dishes according to her own taste, and sometimes she can do some light housework. She said with satisfaction: "Home hospital beds are really great."
    Home hospital beds can not only cure diseases, but also cost very little. It only costs 3 *jiao* a day for "hospitalization," which is two-thirds to four-fifths less than staying in a hospital. At the same time, it can also save the patient from the pain and trouble of going to the hospital. Having relatives to take care of you in a "home hospital bed" is the most needed thing for patients. Patient Li Siqi said: "Even if the hospital is very considerate to patients, the hospital is one nurse taking care of many patients, while at home the whole family takes care of me. With home hospital beds, I would never stay in the hospital."

    The Subject of Remolding Thought
    Doctors taking the initiative to visit patients is a first for most medical staff. When Feng Wugong, director of the Tangjiakou Clinic, first carried his medical bag to knock on the patient's door, he felt very awkward and couldn't put down his airs. But more than two months later, because he often went deep into the masses, understood the thoughts and feelings of the working people and the suffering of the patients, his thoughts and feelings and service attitude gradually changed. He no longer felt that going to the patient's home for treatment and checking the ward was something that made him lose face, but it was something that he had to do. The relationship between doctors and patients was not only a medical relationship, but also established a deep friendship.
    Going deep into the patient's home and understanding the patient's family and living conditions, made the medical staff gradually realize how inhumane the previous rules and regulations were, which only cared about treating the disease and ignored the patient's difficulties and pain, and were formulated purely from the hospital's perspective. Dr. Feng Wugong talked about two completely different examples that happened in his clinic before and after: Last summer, the family members of a patient with severe burns on both legs came to the clinic and asked him to go to the patient's home to perform surgery, but he refused. He said that a doctor should strictly follow the "operating procedures," how can severe burns be treated in the patient's home away from the operating room? As a result, the patient's family members said angrily: "You don't save people in an emergency, you are too rigid in implementing the system." And recently, another incident occurred: Zhai Huilan, a female worker from the Tianjin Knitting Factory, was weak after childbirth and suffered from mastitis. Her left breast had become inflamed and suppurated and had to be operated on. The doctors believed that they should do everything possible to save the patient and could not refuse to treat the patient under the guise of rules and regulations, so they admitted her to the "home hospital bed." Dr. Feng Wugong and his assistant performed a deep breast drainage operation in the patient's small dwelling. Doctors and nurses went to see her every day, and when they saw that Zhai Huilan's family had no one to take care of her, they helped sweep the floor, pour dirty water, and sometimes helped her cook. Zhai Huilan's husband said with emotion: "You not only cured my wife's illness, but also took care of my family, and you always think about the patients. It would be great if all the doctors in the country had your kind of service spirit."
    The creation of "home hospital beds" is also a process of ideological transformation for some medical staff. No wonder some doctors say: "Home hospital beds' have become a subject for remolding our thoughts." In the creation of many "home hospital beds," we see that the communist spirit of everything for the patient is taking root and blossoming in the minds of medical staff.

    懂病情，又懂人情
    ——记天津实行“家庭病床”的革命创举
    本报记者　朱泽民　洪敏生
    第一张“家庭病床”
    三个多月前，天津唐家口门诊部来了个患肺结核的女病人赵翠兰。她连着几天发高烧，不思饮食，已经被疾病折磨得骨瘦如柴，每天需要注射链霉素。这种情况当然最好是住院治疗，但是医院没有空床位了。她的丈夫不得不每天请两次假，背她到门诊部来打针。她穿着棉袄，还蒙着厚棉被，伏在丈夫身上，一到门诊部，就累得喘不过气来。打完针她的丈夫又背着回家，她躺在床上几个钟头都不能动弹，连喝水的力气都没有。用赵翠兰自己的话说：“那时候，我只比死人多一口气。”
    赵翠兰就这样每天由丈夫背来背去，连着半个月，她不但病情毫无起色，还添了病。
    病人的这种困难和痛苦，门诊部的医生和护士都看到了。当时他们正讨论着在病人家里开设病床的事情，可是很多人不同意。有的说，唐家口街有两万多居民，门诊部的四个医生怎么忙得过来；有的怕技术低，管不好病床；有的怕累，风雨无阻地到病人家去，吃不消；有的干脆说：“这简直是胡闹。”正在争论不休的时候，他们看到赵翠兰的具体情况，思想里展开了斗争，内心受到了责备。正像门诊部主任冯武功所说的：“为病人解除痛苦本是医生的应尽职责，难道我们就不能想办法为赵翠兰解除痛苦吗？”经过大家算细账，认为在现有人力条件下，开设十张“家庭病床”没问题，门诊部技术低也可以请区级医院协助指导。于是很多人提议：“就在赵翠兰家开设第一张‘家庭病床’，试一试！”
    从此，赵翠兰再也不用丈夫背来背去，每天医生和护士到她家去试表、打针、查病房，有时候还帮她买东西做饭。赵翠兰在家里又安心，又能养病，病情很快好转，食欲也逐渐增加，一个多月病就好了。当她“出院”的时候，体重竟增加了十市斤！
    “家庭病床”的好处多
    我们从访问的不同的病人口中，听到了“家庭病床”给病人带来的各种好处。
    当我们一走进患淋巴结核、脊椎结核病人刘孟海家的时候，就有一种整洁、美观的感觉。这个“病房”从设备上可能比医院的病房简单些，但是这对病人的治病并没有什么妨碍。在他的“病房”中间放着一张木床，这就是病床，洁白的床单上铺着凉席，痰盂用盖子盖着，屋子里一尘不染，连桌上的药水瓶都是干干净净的。原来这是在医生和护士的指导下，使病人和家属了解了卫生和护理知识，把“病房”收拾得整整齐齐，连刘孟海的孩子都做了卡介苗检查，这样，病人在家养病几乎同在医院里一样。
    结核病人江姣卿又是另外一种情况。她有五个孩子，前些时她本来住在医院里治病，可是心里总是惦记着家里的五个孩子，睡不着觉，也吃不好饭，只好又回到家里。现在她住进“家庭病床”，随时可以看到自己的孩子，又可以随自己口味做点可口的菜，有时还可以做点轻微的家务事，她满意地说：“家庭病床实在太好了。”
    家庭病床既能治好病，又花费很少，每天只花三角钱的“住院”费，比住在医院里要节省三分之二到五分之四，同时也可以免去病人去医院时在路上所受的痛苦和麻烦。住在“家庭病床”里有亲属照顾，这对病人来说是最需要的事情。病人李思琪就说：“即使医院对病人十分体贴，但医院是一个护士照顾许多病人，而在家里是全家照顾我一个人，有了家庭病床，说什么我也不住医院了。”
    改造思想的课题
    医生主动上门来找病人，这对大部分医务人员来说，生平还是第一次。唐家口门诊部主任冯武功第一次提着医包去叩病人的大门的时候，就觉得很蹩扭，放不下架子。可是两个多月后，由于经常深入群众，了解了劳动人民的思想感情和病人的疾苦，在他的思想感情和服务态度上也就渐渐地发生了变化。他不再感觉到病人家去治病、查病房是什么面子上不好看的事情，而是非去不可了，医生和病人也不仅是医患之间的关系，而是建立了深厚的友谊。
    深入病家，了解了病人的家庭情况和生活情况，使医务人员逐渐认识到：以前那种只管治病不顾病人的困难和痛苦、单纯从医院角度出发而制订的一些规章制度是多么不近人情。冯武功大夫谈到了前后发生在他的门诊部的两个完全不同的例子：去年夏天有一个两腿严重烫伤的病人的家属，到门诊部来请他去家里为病人动手术，他拒绝了。他说，一个医生应该严格执行“操作规程”，处理严重烫伤怎么能离开手术室到病人家里去进行呢？结果病人家属气愤地说：“见急不救，你们执行制度太死了。”而最近又发生了一件事：天津针织厂女工翟惠兰产后体弱，又患了乳腺炎，左乳已经发炎化脓，必须动手术。医生们就认为应该千方百计地挽救病人，不能在规章制度的幌子下拒绝给病人治病，就收她住进了“家庭病床”。冯武功大夫和他的助手在病人的一间小住屋里进行了乳房深部排脓手术。医生和护士每天去为她看病，他们见到翟惠兰家里没人照顾她，就帮助扫地、倒脏水，有时还帮她做饭。翟惠兰的丈夫感动地说：“你们不但为我爱人治好了病，还替我管家，处处替病人着想，要是全国的医生都有你们这样的服务精神就太好了。”
    “家庭病床”的创立，也是一些医务人员思想的转变的过程。难怪有的医生说：“‘家庭病床’成了改造我们思想的课题。”在创办许许多多“家庭病床”中，我们看到了一切为了病人的共产主义精神正在医务人员思想里生根开花。
