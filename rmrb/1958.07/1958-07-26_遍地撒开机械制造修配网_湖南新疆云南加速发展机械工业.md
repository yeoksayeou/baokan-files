Spreading Mechanical Manufacturing and Repair Networks Everywhere
Hunan, Xinjiang, and Yunnan Accelerate the Development of the Machinery Industry

    This newspaper Changsha, July 25th - Hunan Province is utilizing existing small factories as a foundation to establish a relatively complete local machinery industry system, in order to rely on its own strength to rapidly produce more machinery and equipment, meeting the needs of the continuous leap forward in industry and agriculture.

    According to the decision of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hunan Province will adopt the principles of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor, and cooperation. In cities such as Changsha, Hengyang, Xiangtan, Shaoyang, and Zhuzhou, it will establish thirteen leading factories and eleven specialized auxiliary factories based on existing scattered small factories, as the foundation of the province's machinery industry. Currently, these units are expanding while also producing. The first batch of 15,000 needed technical workers has already begun training in various state-owned and locally state-owned enterprises within the province. After most of these factories are completed and put into production in the second half of 1959, they can provide various relatively precise and complex machine tools, as well as complete sets of mechanical equipment for internal combustion engines, tractors, electric motors, and textiles, chemicals, and metallurgy.

    Each Special Zone and city will establish central machinery factories and agricultural machinery factories based on existing enterprises, capable of undertaking the manufacture and repair of general machinery and equipment. More than eighty counties and cities throughout the province will establish basic machinery industry factories. These will mainly serve agricultural production. These types of machinery factories will be equipped with three to five mobile engineering vehicles, which will go to the countryside during busy farming seasons to repair tractors and irrigation and drainage machinery. More than three thousand townships throughout the province will establish machinery repair stations, forming a rural repair network and simple farm tool manufacturing network centered on county machinery factories, achieving minor repairs within the township and major and medium repairs within the county.

    The construction of these machinery factories will make full use of existing small factories or metal cooperatives, developing from small to large, and completing construction in phases according to needs and urgency. The required funds will in principle be raised by the localities themselves. In this way, it will be two to three times faster than following a step-by-step approach, and the investment will be less, allowing the machinery industry to catch up with other economic sectors at the fastest speed. By 1962, after all the factories and stations in the special zones, counties, and townships are completed, the entire province will form a machinery industry network combining large, medium, and small enterprises.

    This newspaper Urumqi, July 25th - While vigorously developing the iron and steel industry, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has launched a surge in developing the machinery industry. Before National Day this year, 6,122 large, medium, and small machinery factories throughout the autonomous region will be put into production. After these factories are put into production, they can basically solve the difficulties in developing local industries due to a lack of equipment.

    Xinjiang's method for developing the machinery industry is: start production simply first, then gradually expand and mechanize, in order to "transform guerrilla units into main forces" and "transform small factories into large factories." The thirty-two backbone manufacturing plants that the autonomous region plans to build this year will also be based on existing factories or workshops, or select temporary factory buildings, transfer equipment, and start production simply first, then produce and construct simultaneously. By adopting this method, all of these backbone factories can be put into production before National Day this year.

    The manufacturing and repair factories built by various special zones, counties, and communes also start with manual production first, then gradually mechanize. The Hotan Special Zone has adopted this method and has already built 453 agricultural machinery repair factories.

    The employees of the existing thirty or so repair factories, iron factories, and repair workshops (groups) in various places are currently rushing to manufacture more than 3,500 lathes to equip the machinery industry in special zones and counties. They are also undertaking the manufacture of a large number of urgently needed equipment such as electric motors, generators, and diesel engines. (Wen Hui)

    This newspaper - Yunnan Province is vigorously developing the iron and steel industry on one hand, and actively establishing a machinery industry system on the other.

    The province plans to build more than 4,000 indigenous iron smelting furnaces and more than 200 small blast furnaces with a capacity of three tons or more this year, while also building a batch of steelmaking furnaces. In addition to the output of existing steel plants, the iron production this year can reach 400,000 to 500,000 tons, and the annual steel production can also leap to 80,000 to 100,000 tons. By the end of June, more than 480 iron smelting furnaces have been built in various places. Some places have also produced steel.

    In terms of the machinery industry, Yunnan Province will use Kunming and Gejiu, two industrial cities, as technical centers, and gradually establish special machinery factories in various special zones and autonomous prefectures, and establish general machinery factories in each county. By 1962, the province will have 100,000 machine tools, gradually forming a machinery industry system for the entire province.

    Yunnan Province's development of the machinery industry pays attention to fully utilizing and tapping the potential of the existing machinery industry. They adopt the "atomic fission" method to transform one factory into several factories, and transform small factories into large factories. The heavy machine tool factory and forging and casting factory newly built by utilizing some of the strength of the Kunming Machine Tool Plant have already started construction. Based on Yunnan Machinery Factory, Kunming Drilling Machine Factory, etc., factories such as a mining machinery factory, internal combustion engine factory, and steam turbine factory will be built separately. In the second half of the year, machinery factories in Kunming, Gejiu, Chuxiong, Dali, Zhanyi and other places will increase the production of 3,000 machine tools to equip the machinery industry in various places. Kunming Machine Tool Plant and others will also train thousands of mechanical workers for various places.

    遍地撒开机械制造修配网
    湖南新疆云南加速发展机械工业
    本报长沙25日电　湖南省正在利用现有的一些小厂为基础，建立一套比较完整的地方机械工业体系，以便依靠自己的力量迅速地生产更多的机器设备，满足工农业不断跃进的需要。
    按照中共湖南省委的决定，湖南省将采取集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的方针，在长沙、衡阳、湘潭、邵阳、株洲等城市，以原有一些零散的小厂为基础，办起十三个主导厂和十一个专业辅助厂，作为全省机械工业的基础。现在，这些单位正在一面扩建，一面生产。第一期需要的一万五千个技术工人，已经开始在省内各国营和地方国营企业进行培训。这些工厂到1959年下半年大部分建成投入生产以后，可以提供各种比较精密复杂的机床，以及内燃机、拖拉机、电动机和纺织、化学、冶炼等成套的机械设备。
    各专区、市将以原有企业为基础，建立能担任一般机械设备制造和修配的中心机械厂和农业机械厂。全省八十多个县市都要建立机械工业的基层厂。它主要是为农业生产服务。这类机械厂将配备三、五辆流动工程车，在农忙时下乡修理拖拉机和排灌机械。全省三千多个乡都建立机械修配站，形成以县机械厂为中心的农村修配网和简单农具制造网，做到小修不出乡，大中修不出县。
    这些机械工厂的兴建，都尽量利用原有小厂或金属合作社，由小到大，根据需要缓急分期建成；所需资金原则上都由各地自筹解决。这样，就能比按部就班的做法要快两三倍，而且投资少，使机械工业能够以最快的速度赶到其他经济部门的前面去。到1962年，各专区、县、乡的厂、站全部建成以后，全省就可以构成一个大中小结合的机械工业网。　（罗厚仁）
    本报乌鲁木齐25日电　新疆维吾尔自治区在大力发展钢铁工业的同时，掀起了大办机械工业的浪潮。全自治区在今年国庆节前，将有六千一百二十二个大、中、小型机械厂投入生产。这些工厂投入生产以后，可以基本上解决发展地方工业中缺乏设备的困难。
    新疆发展机械工业的办法是：因陋就简先上马，逐步扩建和机械化，以便“游击队变主力”、“小厂变大厂”。全自治区今年计划兴办的三十二个骨干制造厂，也是以现有的工厂或车间为主，或者选定临时厂房，抽调设备，先因陋就简地上马，然后边生产、边建设。采取这一办法，到今年国庆节前，这些骨干工厂就可以全部投入生产。
    各专区、县和社兴建的制造厂、修配厂，也是以手工生产为主先上马，然后逐步机械化。和阗专区采用这种办法，已经建成四百五十三个农业机具修配厂。
    各地现有的三十多个修配厂、铁工厂和修理车间（组）的职工，目前正在赶制三千五百多台车床，装备专区和县以下的机械工业。他们还承制了大批电动机、发电机、柴油机等当前急需的设备。（文慧）
    本报讯　云南省一面大办钢铁工业，一面积极建立机械工业体系。
    全省今年计划兴建四千多个土炼铁炉、二百多座三吨以上的小高炉，同时要建设一批炼钢炉。加上现有钢铁厂的产量，今年铁的生产量可达四十到五十万吨；钢的年产量也可跃为八万到十万吨。到6月底，各地便建成了四百八十多座炼铁炉。有些地方还炼出了钢。
    在机械工业方面，云南省将以昆明、个旧两个工业城市为技术中心，逐步在各个专区和自治州建立起专用机械厂，在每个县建立起通用机械厂。到1962年，全省将拥有十万台机床，逐步形成全省的机械工业体系。
    云南省发展机械工业，注意了充分利用和挖掘现有机械工业的潜力。他们采取“原子核分裂”的办法，变一厂为数厂，变小厂为大厂。利用昆明机床厂的部分力量新建的重型机床厂和锻铸厂已经动工建设。以云南机械厂、昆明钻机厂等为基础，将分别建成矿山机械厂、内燃机厂、汽轮机厂等工厂。昆明、个旧、楚雄、大理、沾益等地的机械工厂，在下半年要增制三千台机床，装备各地机械工业。昆明机床厂等还将为各地培养上千名机械工人。
