    Unity is Strength
    ——Congratulations on the Signing of the Joint Defense Agreement between the United Arab Republic and Iraq

    The governments of the United Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq signed a joint defense agreement in Damascus on July 19th. The agreement stipulates that the two countries will act as one to resist aggression against either of them or any one of them. United Arab Republic President Nasser also announced that the United Arab Republic will provide Iraq with all the weapons it needs to defend the Republic of Iraq, the United Arab Republic, and the Arab national independence movement. Iraqi Republic Deputy Prime Minister Arif also firmly stated that in order to deal with possible enemy intrusions, the Iraqi people will fight for "every inch of the motherland." The joint defense agreement between the United Arab Republic and Iraq, as well as the firm attitude expressed by the leaders of the two countries, will not only greatly strengthen the Arab people's power to resist the threat of imperialist aggression and defend national independence, but will also be a great encouragement to the entire Arab nation's unity and struggle for national independence.

    U.S. and British imperialism are now continuing to send invading troops to Lebanon and Jordan. British Marines landed on the Libyan coast near Egypt on the 19th. Under the instigation and encouragement of U.S. and British imperialism, the Jordanian puppet King Hussein has been constantly clamoring to invade Iraq. The situation is very clear: U.S. and British imperialism are attempting to gain a foothold in Lebanon and Jordan, then attack Iraq from both sides, strangle this newborn republic, and then coerce the United Arab Republic, in order to revive their colonialist "prestige" in the Middle East and the entire Asian-African region. But this is just a pipe dream of theirs. The end of colonialism is irreversibly approaching. In the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, people have accumulated rich lessons and experience. To deal with imperialist aggressors, one must never retreat or compromise, but only resolutely counterattack in order to force them to withdraw their aggressive claws, recognize the facts, and accept peace. The conclusion of the joint defense agreement between the United Arab Republic and Iraq is the best answer to the imperialist military threat.

    Imperialism has always adopted the method of divide and rule, and defeating them one by one, to maintain its bloody rule over the colonies. Now, this sinister trick is also difficult to work. Not only has the unity of the Arab nation been unprecedentedly strengthened, but the unity of peace-loving people all over the world is stronger than ever. Since U.S. and British imperialism have colluded to threaten and provoke the Arab national independence movement and world peace, then the Arab people and all peace-loving and national independence-upholding countries and people in the world cannot but further unite to repel this threat and provocation and stop their aggression. The conclusion of the joint defense agreement between the United Arab Republic and Iraq is a manifestation of the strong confidence and determination of the two countries.

    An Arab proverb says: "Choose a neighbor before settling down, choose a companion before setting out." The Republic of Iraq has just embarked on the road to national independence and is facing the military threat of imperialism; although the United Arab Republic has long embarked on the road to national independence, U.S. and British imperialism have always been eyeing it covetously. Now that the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic have united to jointly resist the threat of imperialist aggression, this has greatly strengthened the fighting power of the two countries. Of course, in the struggle to defend national sovereignty and national independence, the entire Arab nation, except for a small handful of traitors and national scum who have taken refuge in imperialism, will stand on their side, and the powerful socialist camp will inevitably give them loyal support and assistance. As long as all anti-imperialist forces strengthen unity and consolidate unity, the imperialist threat is not to be feared, imperialist aggression can be completely defeated, and the imperialist conspiracy to expand the war can be stopped. Even if war finally breaks out, the people of all countries will surely be able to defeat the creators of aggressive war in the war and achieve a complete victory. This is a truth proven by a series of historical facts.

    We, the Chinese people, warmly congratulate the signing of the joint defense agreement between the United Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq, and congratulate them on bravely and fearlessly advancing on the road of national independence and national unity!

### 团结就是力量——祝阿联和伊拉克共同防御协定的签订

    团结就是力量
    ——祝阿联和伊拉克共同防御协定的签订
    阿拉伯联合共和国政府和伊拉克共和国政府7月19日在大马士革签订了一项共同防御协定。协定规定两国像一个国家一样采取行动，来抵抗对它们两国或者对它们当中任何一国的侵略。阿联总统纳赛尔并且宣布，阿联将给予伊拉克以一切它所需要的武器，以保卫伊拉克共和国、阿联和阿拉伯民族独立运动。伊拉克共和国副总理阿里夫也坚定地表示，为了对付敌人的可能的进犯，伊拉克人民将为“祖国的每一寸土地而战斗”。阿联和伊拉克两国的共同防御协定，以及两国领导人所表示的坚定态度，不仅将大大加强阿拉伯人民反抗帝国主义的侵略威胁和保卫民族独立的力量，而且对整个阿拉伯民族的团结和争取民族独立的斗争也是一个极大的鼓舞。
    美英帝国主义现在正继续向黎巴嫩和约旦增派侵略军队。英国海军陆战队19日在靠近埃及地区的利比亚海岸登陆。在美英帝国主义的唆使和怂恿下，约旦傀儡国王侯赛因不住地狂叫要向伊拉克进犯。形势很明显：美英帝国主义是企图在黎巴嫩、约旦站稳脚根之后，对伊拉克来一个两面夹击，扼杀这个新生的共和国，进而威逼阿联，在中东以及整个亚非地区重振它们殖民主义的“声威”。但是这不过是它们的一场迷梦罢了。殖民主义的末日是无可挽回地临近了。在反帝国主义、反殖民主义斗争中，人们已经积累了丰富的教训和经验。对付帝国主义侵略者，决不能退让或者妥协，只有坚决地进行反击，才能迫使它们缩回侵略的魔手，承认事实，接受和平。阿联和伊拉克两国的共同防御协定的缔结，就是对于帝国主义武力威胁的最好的回答。
    帝国主义对于殖民地一向是采取分而治之、各个击破的办法来维持其血腥统治的。现在，这种阴险伎俩也是难于行得通了。不仅阿拉伯民族的团结力量空前加强，全世界爱好和平的人民的团结力量也比任何时候更加强大。美英帝国主义既然已经勾结起来，向阿拉伯民族独立运动，向世界和平进行了威胁和挑衅，那末，阿拉伯人民以及世界上一切爱好和平、维护民族独立的国家和人民，也就不能不更进一步团结起来，打退这种威胁和挑衅，制止它们的侵略。阿联和伊拉克两国的共同防御协定的缔结，正是两个国家的这种坚强信心和决心的表现。
    阿拉伯谚语说：“定居先择邻，赶路先择伴”。伊拉克共和国刚刚走上民族独立的道路，就面临了帝国主义的武力威胁；阿联虽然早已走上了民族独立的道路，可是美英帝国主义对它也一直虎视眈眈。现在伊拉克共和国和阿联已经团结起来共同反抗帝国主义的侵略威胁，这就大大加强了两国的斗争力量。当然，在保卫国家主权和民族独立的斗争中，整个阿拉伯民族，除掉一小撮投靠帝国主义的卖国者和民族败类以外，都会站在它们一边，而且强大的社会主义阵营，也必然给它们以忠实的支持和帮助。只要一切反帝国主义的力量加强团结，巩固团结，帝国主义的威胁就毫不足惧，帝国主义的侵略也完全可以打败，帝国主义扩大战争的阴谋也可以制止，就是战争终于发生，各国人民也一定能够在战争中击破侵略战争的制造者而取得彻底的胜利。这是一系列的历史事实所证明了的真理。
    我们中国人民热烈祝贺阿联和伊拉克共和国的共同防御协定的签订，并祝贺它们在民族独立、民族团结的道路上勇敢无畏地前进！
