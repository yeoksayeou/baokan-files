    New System for Soviet Agricultural Product Procurement
    Jun Qiang

    A few days ago, the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session adopted a resolution on implementing a new system for agricultural product procurement. The Soviet Council of Ministers has now passed a corresponding resolution, which came into effect on July 1st. This is another major new measure taken by the Soviet Union after the reorganization of Machine Tractor Stations this spring, which is related to the interests of all Soviet people.
    The issue of state procurement of agricultural products is a matter of ensuring the supply of grain and industrial raw materials to the residents. It involves major fundamental issues such as national economic construction and the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, procurement methods vary according to the different stages of socialist construction and development. The Soviet Union has implemented various methods such as the surplus grain collection system, grain tax, and compulsory sales system. Now, the development status of the Soviet national economy and the advanced level of agricultural production have provided the conditions for implementing a new procurement system. In other words, the new procurement system is a product of the development of Soviet socialist construction.
    Since the CPSU Central Committee's September Plenum in 1953, the Soviet Union has continuously adopted many major innovative measures to break with conventions in developing agricultural production and consolidating the collective farm system. Such as large-scale land reclamation, sending a large number of experienced cadres to support agriculture, implementing a new planning system, and increasing procurement prices. During this period, the state also greatly increased investment in agriculture. For example, the investment in the last four years was 10 billion rubles more than the total investment in the second, third, fourth, and the first three years of the fifth five-year plans. These measures have promoted the leap forward of Soviet agricultural productive forces at an unprecedented speed, bringing the development of collective farms to a new and higher stage. As a result, Soviet agricultural products have greatly increased, with an average annual growth rate of 7.1% in the past four years. The income of collective farms and farmers has also increased sharply. Collective farms have the strength to purchase complex agricultural machinery, and the collective economy of collective farms has become a solid foundation for improving the welfare of farmers. As Khrushchev said in his report, the collective economy of collective farms has now undergone profound qualitative changes.
    This spring, the measures taken by the Soviet Union to further develop the collective farm system and reorganize machine tractor stations were based on the great development of agriculture, the greater consolidation of collective farms, and the unparalleled strength of their collective economy. The basic conditions for changing the procurement system for agricultural products now are the same. The reorganization of machine tractor stations has brought new changes in the economic relations between the state and collective farms, establishing new conditions in agriculture. This has also promoted the change of the agricultural product procurement system.
    It would be incomplete to simply understand the CPSU Central Committee's new regulations on the procurement system as the abolition of the compulsory sales system; it contains many aspects. Specifically, there are the following items:
    Abolish the method of collective farms' compulsory sale of agricultural products to the state, that is, the state no longer purchases agricultural products from collective farms at requisition prices.
    Abolish the system of collective farms paying in-kind remuneration to machine tractor stations, technical repair stations, etc. In the past, the state provided services to collective farms through machine tractor stations, and collective farms supplied the state with agricultural products in the form of in-kind remuneration to machine tractor stations. The amount of agricultural products the state obtained from this method was quite large; for grain alone, it was about one billion poods per year.
    The state adopts a unified acquisition method to purchase agricultural products from collective farms. That is to say, the other two procurement methods in the past besides compulsory sales are also abolished: procurement and advance purchase contracts. So-called procurement is the state purchasing agricultural products from collective farms at a price higher than the requisition price. Advance purchase contracts are the method by which the state purchases agricultural products from collective farms by signing contracts with collective farms, which is mainly the method used by the state when purchasing technical crops.
    The new acquisition method is: the state still purchases a certain amount of major agricultural products from collective farms, such as grains, potatoes, meat, milk, wool, and eggs, according to the area of agricultural land used by the farms. At the same time, taking into account the agricultural production specialization in various regions, the acquisition quotas for various agricultural products also vary from region to region. For example, Central Asia is most suitable for developing technical crops such as cotton. In the future, the state may not purchase grain from these regions.
    The acquisition prices of agricultural products are based on the natural, climatic, and economic conditions of various regions, and unified prices are stipulated separately, that is, in the future, there will be only one price for a certain agricultural product, and there will be no distinction between requisition prices, procurement prices, etc.
    The acquisition prices will be both stable and flexible, and will be appropriately adjusted according to the specific conditions of each year, that is, the acquisition prices will remain unchanged under normal harvest conditions, but will be adjusted in bumper or poor harvest years.
    Cancel all debts owed by collective farms in the past few years in terms of compulsory sales, advance purchase contracts, and in-kind remuneration for the work of tractor stations.
    It can be seen from these measures that the new procurement system pays great attention to the characteristics of agricultural development in various regions and adopts flexible methods appropriate to local conditions. This is a major innovation implemented by the Soviet Union in response to past situations. In the past, the requirement that all collective farms in all regions must sell grain, potatoes, etc. limited the enthusiasm of the masses to fully utilize their potential, and had some adverse effects on the specialization of agricultural production and on the full development of the most favorable agricultural sectors in the region. Now, not only in the acquisition of agricultural products, but also in prices, regional characteristics are taken into account. This will undoubtedly enable collective farms to vigorously develop the most suitable crops in the region, and can more effectively utilize the land. In this way, output will increase, labor productivity will increase accordingly, and the cost of agricultural products will inevitably decrease.
    The new measures fully reflect the Communist Party's concern for the balanced development of collective farms throughout the Soviet Union. For example, the cancellation of all debts owed by collective farms due to poor harvests and other reasons will enable some collective farms that were economically weaker in the past to move forward easily and quickly catch up with the level of advanced ones. This will undoubtedly further encourage the production enthusiasm of collective farms and farmers. The new unified acquisition price can also eliminate unreasonable phenomena such as excessively high prices of individual agricultural products caused by inconsistent prices, so that the vast majority of collective farms can benefit from it. In addition, the new acquisition price is not set in stone and will be adjusted according to the specific circumstances of each year. In this way, even in years of poor harvests, collective farms will not have too little income.
    The new system can also greatly streamline the procurement agencies and save expenses for the state. In the past, because the procurement system was complex and the procurement prices were not uniform, a relatively large procurement agency was formed, increasing non-productive expenditures, which invisibly increased the price of agricultural products purchased by the state.
    In short, the new measures taken by the CPSU Central Committee to procure agricultural products are proposed in response to the needs of objective development. It will have a great impact on further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and developing the national economy, and on improving the welfare of all Soviet people.

    苏联农产品采购的新制度
    君强
    前几天，苏共中央全会通过了实行新的农产品采购制度的决议。苏联部长会议现已通过相应决议，从7月1日起实行。这是继今春改组机器拖拉机站之后，苏联采取的又一项关系到全体苏联人民利益的重大新措施。
    国家采购农产品的问题，是国家保证供给居民粮食和工业原料的问题。它涉及到国家经济建设、工农联盟等重大的根本问题。因此，根据社会主义建设发展的不同阶段，采购方式也有所不同。苏联曾实行过余粮收集制、粮食税、义务交售制等多种方式。现在，苏联国民经济的发展状况和农业生产达到的高度水平，具备了实行新采购制度的条件，换句话说，新采购制度是苏联社会主义建设发展的产物。
    自从1953年苏共中央九月全会以后，苏联在发展农业生产、巩固集体农庄制度方面，连续采取了许多打破陈规的重大革新措施。像大规模开垦荒地、派遣大批有经验的干部支援农业、实行新的计划制度、提高采购价格等。在此期间，国家还大大增加了对农业的投资，例如最近四年来的投资额，比在第二、第三、第四个五年计划和第五个五年计划前三年的投资总和还多一百亿卢布。这些措施促使苏联的农业生产力以空前速度向前跃进，使集体农庄的发展达到了新的更高的阶段。结果，苏联的农产品大大增加，四年来农产品每年的平均增长速度达到了7.1％。集体农庄和庄员的收入也急剧提高了。集体农庄已有力量购买复杂的农业机器，集体农庄的公有经济已成为提高庄员生活福利的牢固基础，正如赫鲁晓夫报告中所说的，现在集体农庄公有经济发生了深刻的质的变化。
    今年春天，苏联所实行的进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的措施，就是在农业大发展、集体农庄更加巩固、它们的公有经济无比强大的基础上采取的。现在改变农产品的采购制度所根据的基本条件，也是一样。而机器拖拉机站的改组，使国家和集体农庄之间的经济关系发生新的变化，在农业中建立了新的条件。这对农产品采购制度的改变，也起了促进作用。
    如果把苏共中央关于采购制度的这项新规定，简单地理解为取消义务交售制，是不全面的，它包含着许多内容。具体说来有以下几项：
    取消集体农庄向国家义务交售农产品的办法，即国家不再以征购价格向集体农庄征购农产品。
    取消集体农庄向机器拖拉机站、技术修理站等支付的实物报酬的制度。以往，国家通过机器拖拉机站为集体农庄服务，而集体农庄则以付给机器拖拉机站实物报酬的形式供给国家农产品。国家从这个方式得到的农产品数额相当大，每年仅谷物一项即约有十亿普特。
    国家采取统一的收购方式向集体农庄购买农产品。这就是说，也取消了过去除义务交售外的其他两种采购方式：采购和预购合同。所谓采购，是国家以比征购价格为高的价格向集体农庄购买农产品。预购合同是国家通过同集体农庄订立合同的办法，向集体农庄购买农产品，这主要是国家在购买技术作物时应用的方式。
    新的收购方法是：国家仍根据集体农庄使用的农业用地面积，向农庄购买一定数量的主要农产品，像谷物、马铃薯、肉类、牛奶、羊毛、鸡蛋等，都将规定收购的定额。同时考虑到各地区农业生产专业化的情况，各种农产品的收购定额也因地区而有所不同。像中亚地区最适宜于发展棉花等技术作物，今后国家可以不向这些地区收购谷物。
    农产品的收购价格，是根据各地区自然、气候和经济条件，分别规定统一的价格，即今后一种农产品将只有一种价格，不再有征购价格、采购价格等等区分。
    收购价格将是既稳定又灵活的，将根据每年的具体条件做适当的调整，即在收成正常的情况下，收购价格不变，但在大丰收或者歉收年份，则加以调整。
    勾销过去几年来集体农庄在义务交售、预购合同以及对拖拉机站的工作支付实物报酬方面，欠下的全部债务。
    从这些措施中可以看出，新的采购制度十分注意各地区农业发展的特点，采取了因地制宜的灵活办法。这是苏联针对过去情况而实行的一项重大革新。过去由于规定各地所有的集体农庄都必须交售谷物、马铃薯等，限制了群众充分发挥潜力的积极性，对农业生产的专业化，对充分发展当地最有利的农业部门，都有某些不利的影响。现在，不仅在收购农产品上，而且在价格上都考虑到了地区特点，这无疑会使集体农庄大力发展当地最适宜的作物，可以更有效地利用土地。这样，产量增加，劳动生产率随之提高，农产品的成本也必然降低。
    新措施充分体现出共产党关怀全苏各地集体农庄的平衡的发展。例如，勾销集体农庄因歉收等原因所欠下的全部债务，将使一些过去经济上较薄弱的集体农庄也能轻装迈进，迅速地赶上先进者的水平。这无疑会更加鼓励集体农庄和庄员的生产积极性。新的统一的收购价格，还可以消除因价格不统一而造成的个别农产品价格过高的不合理现象，使绝大多数集体农庄从中得到好处。此外，新的收购价格，并不是一成不变的，它将根据每年的具体情况调整。这样，即使在歉收年份，集体农庄也不至于收入过少。
    新制度还可以使采购机关大大精简，为国家节省开支。过去因为采购制度复杂，采购价格不统一，所以形成了较庞大的采购机关，增加了非生产性开支，也就无形中使国家采购的农产品价格提高了。
    总之，苏共中央采取的这项采购农产品的新措施，是适应客观发展的需要而提出的，它对进一步巩固工农联盟和发展国民经济，对提高全体苏联人民的福利，都将有很大的影响。
