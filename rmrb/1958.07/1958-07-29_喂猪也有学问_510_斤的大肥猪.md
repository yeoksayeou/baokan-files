There's Skill in Feeding Pigs
    A 510-Jin Fat Pig
    Bu Yongfa, a member of the Meiquan Cooperative of the Tenth Village of Longwang Township, Jintang County, Sichuan, bought a feeder pig in January 1957. When it was sold on June 7th of this year, the pig was four chi six cun long, two chi seven cun high, one chi one cun wide, and weighed 510.8 jin.
    Bu Yongfa did not feed this pig a single grain. He mainly fed broad bean seedlings and sweet potato peels, mixed with a small amount of rice bran and wheat bran. During the feeding process, Bu Yongfa carefully observed and grasped the pig's life patterns, feeding it on time. According to the pig's preferences, he flexibly adjusted the feed. At the same time, he paid attention to the pig's disease prevention, often cleaned the pigsty, so that it ate well, slept soundly, and grew quickly.

    喂猪也有学问
    510斤的大肥猪
    四川金堂县龙王乡十村美泉社社员卜永发，1957年1月份买回一只架子猪饲养，今年6月7日出售时，这只猪有四尺六寸长、二尺七寸高、一尺一寸宽，重达五百一十点八斤。
    卜永发并没有给这只猪喂过一颗粮食，主要喂胡豆苗和红苕皮，掺喂少量的米糠和麦麸。在饲养过程中，卜永发仔细观察，掌握了猪的生活规律，按时喂，根据猪的爱好，灵活调配饲料，同时注意了猪的防疫，经常打扫猪圈，使它吃的好、睡的熟，生长很快。
