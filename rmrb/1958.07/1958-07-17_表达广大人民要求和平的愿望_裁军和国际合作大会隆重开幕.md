Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 16th: The Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference solemnly opened here at 11:00 AM today. Over a thousand representatives and observers attended the opening meeting.

Swedish writer and Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, Artur Lundkvist, delivered the opening speech. He warmly welcomed the participants to his country. He said that the first and most important fact about this conference is that so many representatives from almost every country in the world have gathered here to discuss issues and express the broad masses' desire for peace. We must awaken the broadest strata of the people to the fundamental importance of peace, so as to turn it into a powerful force. He wished the conference success.

Then Swedish Senator Bertil Mogard gave a brief speech.

The conference then elected the presidium. After the election, the conference adjourned until 2:30 PM to resume.

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 15th: The Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference will open here tomorrow at 10:00 AM local time.

Airplanes and other means of transport have successively carried representatives from all corners of the world to Stockholm. So far, about seven hundred representatives attending the conference have registered at the conference secretariat. It is estimated that approximately one thousand two hundred representatives and observers from more than seventy countries and regions will participate in the conference to discuss the extremely important issues of peace and war for the people of the world.

Many foreign guests are now visiting Stockholm. They can be seen in the streets, in grand hotels, and especially in the Hotel Malmen, where the conference secretariat is located. They are talking to each other, exchanging news and opinions about the peace movement in their respective countries.

It has now been three years since the last peace conference was held in Helsinki in 1955. The development of the international situation is greatly in favor of the forces of peace, and unfavorable to the warmongering imperialists. The upsurge of anti-colonialist movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America has increased the difficulties for the imperialist camp that attempts to dominate the world. The imperialists are trying to obstruct disarmament negotiations with all their might, and carry out armed intervention to suppress anti-colonialist movements. However, the development of world events has long proved that their frantic actions are bound to meet with shameful failure. The conference will certainly hear the resounding calls of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America fighting for national liberation.

It is reported that after the official opening of the conference tomorrow morning, a telegram from the Chairman of the World Peace Council, Joliot-Curie, will be read at the meeting. He will not be able to attend the conference due to health reasons. The conference will hold plenary sessions for the first two days, and then the committees will begin their work. The conference will establish five committees: disarmament, political cooperation, economic cooperation, cultural cooperation, and cooperation among peace forces in various countries.

    表达广大人民要求和平的愿望
    裁军和国际合作大会隆重开幕
    新华社斯德哥尔摩16日电　裁军和国际合作大会今天上午十一点在这里开幕。一千多名代表和列席会议的观察员出席了开幕会议。
    瑞典作家、世界和平理事会副主席阿图尔·伦德奎斯特致开幕词。他向与会者来到他的国家表示了热烈的欢迎。他说，关于这次大会首先的和最重要的事实是，来自世界差不多一切国家的这许多代表聚集在这里来讨论问题和表达广大人民要求和平的愿望。我们必须唤醒最广大阶层的人民认识到和平的根本重要意义，以便使之变成一支强大的力量。他预祝大会获得成功。
    接着瑞典参议员伯蒂尔·莫加德发表了简短的讲话。
    大会接着选举了主席团。选举之后，大会休会到下午两点三十分复会。
    据新华社斯德哥尔摩15日电裁军和国际合作大会将于明天本地时间上午十时在这里开幕。
    飞机和其他交通工具先后把代表们从世界各个角落载送到斯德哥尔摩。到现在为止，约有七百名参加大会的代表已经在大会秘书处报到。据估计，来自七十多个国家和地区的大约一千二百名代表和观察员将参加大会，讨论对世界各国人民极为重要的和平和战争问题。
    现在有许多外国客人光临斯德哥尔摩。在街上、在大饭店里、特别是在大会秘书处所在地马耳米饭店，都可以看到他们。他们互相交谈，交换有关本国和平运动的消息和意见。
    自从1955年在赫尔辛基召开上届和平大会以来，现在已有三年了。国际形势的发展大大有利于和平力量，而不利于好战的帝国主义者。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲反殖民主义运动的高涨增加了企图统治世界的帝国主义阵营的困难，帝国主义者企图用一切力量来阻挠裁军谈判，进行武装干涉镇压反殖民主义运动。可是，世界事态的发展早已证明它们这种疯狂的行动必然会遭到可耻的失败。大会一定可以听到为民族解放而斗争的亚非两洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的响亮呼声。
    据悉，在明天上午大会正式开幕后，会上将宣读世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里的来电。他因健康关系将不能来参加大会。大会将在头两天举行全体会议，然后由委员会开始工作。大会将成立裁军、政治合作、经济合作、文化合作以及各国和平力量合作等五个委员会。（附图片）
