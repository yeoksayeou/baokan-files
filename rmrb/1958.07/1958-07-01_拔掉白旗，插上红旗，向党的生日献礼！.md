Pull Down the White Flag, Raise the Red Flag, and Offer a Gift to the Party's Birthday!
    Deng Chumin

    Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China.

    The birth of the Chinese Communist Party marked the rebirth of China, marking that the Chinese people had stood up.

    Thirty-seven years have passed, thirty-seven years of achieving two victories in the bourgeois democratic revolution and the socialist revolution.

    The achievement of the two revolutionary victories is due to the Party and Chairman Mao's creative combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, adhering to the principle of integrating theory with practice, constantly combating dogmatism and empiricism, and leading the Chinese people to find and establish the correct path to defeat powerful enemies and build a new country and a new society.

    At the same time, it is because the Party and Chairman Mao adhered to the mass line, closely linked with the masses, created the people's army and political power, relied on the inexhaustible strength of the people, carried out rectification and anti-rightist struggles, and pushed the all-round socialist leap forward to an endless climax on the economic, political, and ideological fronts.

    In particular, it is because the Party and Chairman Mao grasped the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and creatively used this weapon (for example, launching the rectification movement throughout the Party and the country), enlightening the masses' conscious revolutionary movement, learning lessons from past successes or failures, constantly maintaining and improving ties with the people, and promptly and correctly handling contradictions among the people, maximizing the truth that "besides the leadership of the Party, 600 million people are a decisive factor."

    For thirty-seven years, the Chinese Communist Party has thus planted a communist red flag all over China.

    Recently, The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party formulated the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, guiding the Chinese people like a lighthouse in the correct direction of continuous revolution and continuous advancement. As long as we follow this direction, we will be able to quickly get rid of the backward state of "poor and blank" and leave all capitalist countries far behind.

    However, any road forward is not smooth sailing. We are still in the transition period, and objectively there are still two exploiting classes. The struggle between the two roads and the two methods, although basically victorious, is by no means the end of the struggle.

    Some stubborn bourgeois intellectuals are still "greedily", "recklessly," and "deceptively" "willing to meet God with granite brains..."

    Most of the middle-of-the-roaders, although some say: "Resolved to transform... set up a desperate battle, issued a military order..." Some say: "I am determined to pull down this white flag and surrender." But to truly achieve self-transformation, arduous efforts are still needed in practice.

    Taking my personal experience as an example, I have also rummaged through boxes and searched my brains, determined to dig out all the dirty things of the bourgeoisie from my internal organs, but the shadow of individualism always lingers.

    As for those who are afraid of the ancients and foreigners, who are superstitious about authority and experts, and who do not understand that the source of all knowledge is the practice of production struggle and class struggle, they have not yet been freed from spiritual oppression and cut off their slave tails.

    These are all white flags flying there, these are all blank spots in the communist red flag阵地.

    How to pull down the bourgeois white flag and raise the communist red flag? The first thing is to be determined to transform bourgeois intellectuals into proletarian intellectuals in practical actions under the leadership of the Party.

    "When the Chinese proletariat began to step onto the political stage, it had already raised its own red flag in the Chinese ideological circles" ("Red Flag" inaugural speech). This is because they are laborers of large-scale production, and only labor has completed the qualitative leap from ape to man, and only labor can complete the qualitative leap from bourgeois intellectuals to working-class intellectuals.

    Recently, the leading comrades of various ministries and departments of the central government have resolutely implemented the instructions of the CPC Central Committee on cadres participating in physical labor, and participated in the voluntary labor of the Ming Tombs Reservoir. Premier Zhou Enlai took the lead twice in holding up a bright red labor flag in the scorching sun. He said: There are no leaders here, there is complete equality between superiors and subordinates, and he also said: While we are building socialism, we must create conditions for the great future of communism, so that everyone loves labor and achieves the combination of physical and mental labor.

    Bourgeois intellectuals, to complete the qualitative leap from ape to man, the qualitative leap from bourgeois intellectuals to working-class intellectuals, can only hold a bright red labor flag in their own hands and hearts.

    Labor training is the decisive battle for the transformation of intellectuals.

    We must pull down the bourgeois white flag and raise the communist red flag in this final decisive battle to offer a gift to the Party's birthday!

    拔掉白旗，插上红旗，向党的生日献礼！
    邓初民
    没有共产党，就没有新中国。
    中国共产党的诞生，标志着中国的新生，标志着中国人民已经站了起来。
    三十七年了，这是取得资产阶级民主革命和社会主义革命两次胜利的三十七年。
    两次革命胜利的取得，这是由于党和毛主席创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合，坚持理论联系实际的原则性，不断地打击了教条主义与经验主义，领导中国人民找到了并确立了战胜强大敌人和建设新国家新社会的正确道路。
    同时由于党和毛主席坚持群众路线，紧密地联系群众，创立了人民的军队与政权，依靠人民群众无穷尽的力量，整风反右，在经济、政治、思想各个战线上，把社会主义的全面跃进推向无止境的高潮。
    特别是由于党和毛主席掌握了批评与自我批评这一武器，并创造性地运用这一武器（例如在全党全国展开整风运动），启发群众的自觉革命运动，从历次成功或失败的经验中取得教训，经常保持和改善与人民群众的联系，及时正确处理人民内部矛盾，尽量发挥了“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定因素”的真理。
    中国共产党三十七年来就这样把一面共产主义的红旗插遍了全中国。
    最近党的八大二次会议，制定了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，灯塔般地指引着中国人民不断革命继续前进的正确方向。只要遵循这一方向前进，我们就有可能迅速地摆脱“一穷二白”的落后状态，把所有资本主义国家远远抛在后面。
    不过任何前进的路上，并不是一帆风顺的。我们还处在过渡时期，客观上还存在着两个剥削阶级。两条道路和两种方法的斗争，虽然基本上取得胜利，究竟还不是斗争的结束。
    某些顽固的资产阶级知识分子还在一“贪”二“妄”三“骗”的“愿意带着花岗岩头脑去见上帝……”
    大多数中间派，虽然有的说：“下了改造的决心……摆背水阵、立军令状……”。有的说：“我决心拔掉这面白旗，缴械投降”。但是要真正实现自我改造，还需要在实践中作艰巨的努力。
    就以我的亲身经历来说，也曾翻箱倒箧，搜索枯肠，决心从五脏六腑把资产阶级的肮脏东西都挖出来，但个人主义的阴影，总是随身不散。
    至于既怕古人、又怕洋人，既迷信权威、又迷信专家，不懂得一切知识的源泉都是生产斗争和阶级斗争的实践的人，还远没有解除精神压迫，割掉奴隶尾巴。
    这都是白旗在那里飘扬，这都是共产主义红旗阵地中的空白点。
    怎样拔掉资产阶级的白旗，插上共产主义的红旗？这首先是要在党的领导下，决心从实际行动中把资产阶级知识分子改造成为无产阶级知识分子。
    “中国无产阶级在开始登上政治舞台的时候，就已经在中国思想界举起了自己的红旗”（“红旗”发刊词）这就因为他们是大生产的劳动者，只有劳动才完成了从猿到人的质的大飞跃，也只有劳动才能完成从资产阶级知识分子到工人阶级知识分子的质的大飞跃。
    最近中央机关各部领导同志坚定不移地执行中共中央关于干部参加体力劳动的指示，参加了十三陵水库义务劳动，周恩来总理两次领先在烈日当空中撑起一面鲜艳的劳动红旗。他说：在这里没有首长，在这里上下之间完全平等，他还说：我们在建设社会主义的同时，就要为共产主义的伟大未来创造条件，使所有的人都热爱劳动，做到体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合。
    资产阶级知识分子，要完成从猿到人的质的大飞跃般的从资产阶级知识分子到工人阶级知识分子的质的大飞跃，只有把一面鲜艳的劳动红旗撑在自己的手里、心里。
    劳动锻炼，是知识分子改造的决定性的战役。
    我们必须在这最后一次决定性地战役中，拔掉资产阶级的白旗，插上共产主义的红旗，向党的生日献礼！
