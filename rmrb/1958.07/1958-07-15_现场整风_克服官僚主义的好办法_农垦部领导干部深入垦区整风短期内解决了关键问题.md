On-the-Spot Rectification: A Good Way to Overcome Bureaucracy
Leading Cadres of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation Go Deep into Reclamation Areas for Rectification, Solving Key Problems in a Short Period

(Reported by our newspaper) Minister of State Farms and Land Reclamation Wang Zhen recently led leading cadres from the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, the Mishan Reclamation Bureau, and state farms in conducting on-the-spot rectification for three levels of leading cadres at the Yunshan Reservoir construction site in the Mishan Reclamation Area of Heilongjiang Province.

During this on-the-spot rectification, in just four days, they discovered and resolved key problems in grassroots work that needed to be addressed from the bottom up. These leading cadres witnessed the harm that their own bureaucracy and conservative thinking brought to the construction effort, and experienced the great power of the General Line of Socialist Construction.

Gathered at this on-the-spot rectification were 79 people, including bureau chiefs from the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, bureau chiefs and section chiefs from the Mishan Reclamation Bureau, and farm managers and Party secretaries from various state farms. They participated in physical labor while mobilizing the masses to speak out freely, vividly combining the participation of leading cadres in physical labor, the thorough implementation of the General Line of Socialist Construction, and the promotion of the great leap forward in production. Wang Zhen led these leading cadres and reservoir construction workers in building dams and sleeping in thatched sheds, listening to the workers' opinions on reservoir construction, inspiring them to break superstitions, liberate their thinking, and think boldly and act boldly. They also used on-the-spot worker representative meetings to promote on-the-spot rectification among leading cadres. In the half-hour before the opening of this on-the-spot worker representative meeting, 417 big-character posters were put up, along with more than 1,000 suggestions made orally.

The Yunshan Reservoir is one of the first medium-sized reservoirs to be built in the Mishan Reclamation Area. The construction of this reservoir is mainly carried out by demobilized and retired soldiers, who have a lot of energy, and some have certain construction experience. However, the leadership has not fully utilized their enthusiasm and creativity in the past. The Mishan Reclamation Bureau did not emphasize the overall leadership of the reservoir by the Party committee; the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Reservoir Engineering Office allowed engineers and technicians to decide issues; and these technicians mechanically implemented the construction regulations issued by the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, ignoring the unity of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and one-sidedly pursuing project "quality." As a result, construction efficiency was very low.

The three levels of leading cadres of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, the Reclamation Bureau, and the various state farms, from the opinions raised by the reservoir workers and their own labor inspections, saw that due to the bureaucracy and conservative thinking in construction leadership and engineering design, the construction of the reservoir resulted in being slow, costly, of poor quality and wasteful. They immediately took concrete measures on the spot to correct them. In accordance with the leadership ideology of putting politics in command and following the mass line, they made a resolution at the on-the-spot worker representative meeting: to replace the supervision of technicians with the method of unified leadership by the Party committee, segmented contracting by the construction teams, and completion within a limited time; to abolish all rules and regulations that hinder the great leap forward in construction and to relax the percentage limit of water content in the soil on the dam; and to establish the on-the-spot worker representative meeting as a permanent organization under the leadership of the Party committee, and through this organization mobilize all workers to carry out technical revolution, reform tools, and promote a great leap forward in construction.

These measures greatly increased the enthusiasm of the workers. Construction efficiency jumped from one cubic meter of heavy clay soil, which was difficult to transport, completed by each person per day, to four cubic meters. The workers pledged to continue to increase construction efficiency by one to two times in the shortest possible time, and to complete all 540,000 cubic meters of earthwork for the first phase of the project before the "August 1st" Army Day, blocking the flood at the foot of Yunshan. Everyone offered suggestions and ideas to reform tools and improve operating methods in order to quickly improve construction efficiency. The Mishan Reclamation Bureau, which had not provided convenient conditions for technical revolution and tool reform for construction workers in the past, immediately transported a large number of iron tools and woodworking tools to the construction site and distributed them to various construction teams. The Mishan Farm and the 852 Farm realized the importance of training a large number of technical workers, and decided to send carpenters and blacksmiths to the reservoir construction site to both train apprentices and learn skills. The Party Secretary of the 852 Farm, Li Guilian, saw during the on-the-spot rectification that some demobilized soldiers who had built small reservoirs and airport runways at one time had made very good suggestions. She was reminded that there were many former tank soldiers and car drivers in her farm, and she decided to let these people drive tractors.

Through this on-the-spot rectification, the leading cadres jointly and practically experienced the great power of the General Line of Socialist Construction. Ji Haiqiu, the farm manager of Mishan Farm, said that they had vividly learned here how to thoroughly implement the General Line of Socialist Construction, and as soon as they return to the farm, they will immediately take action, and the enthusiasm of the masses will certainly be more fully utilized. The rest of the leading cadres also expressed their intention to apply the methods and experience of this on-the-spot rectification to their own work, so that the high tide of a comprehensive leap forward in production will follow one after another.

The cadres of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation who have gone deep into the reclamation area are now continuing to carry out on-the-spot rectification. They plan to spend an agricultural production season in the reclamation area, thoroughly solve the problems, propose various fundamental measures to improve the leadership style and improve the leadership work, and then return to the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation.

    现场整风——克服官僚主义的好办法
    农垦部领导干部深入垦区整风短期内解决了关键问题
    本报讯　农垦部部长王震最近带领农垦部、密山农垦局和农场的领导干部，到黑龙江省密山垦区云山水库工地进行了三级领导干部现场整风。
    在这次现场整风中，只用四天时间，就当场发现和解决了基层工作中一些需要自下而上逐级解决的关键问题。这些领导干部在现场整风中看到了自己的官僚主义和保守思想给建设事业带来的危害，体验到了社会主义建设总路线的伟大力量。
    集中在这个现场整风的，有农垦部的局长、密山农垦局的局长和处长、各农场的场长和党委书记七十九人，他们一边参加体力劳动，一边发动群众鸣放，把领导干部参加体力劳动、深入贯彻社会主义建设总路线和推动生产大跃进生动地结合在一起。王震带领这些领导干部和水库工地职工一起修水坝、睡草棚，倾听职工们对水库施工的意见，启发他们破除迷信、解放思想、大胆地想、大胆地作；并且采用现场职工代表会议来推动领导干部进行现场整风。在这个现场职工代表会议开幕前的半小时就贴出了四百一十七张大字报，连同口头提出的意见，共一千多条。
    云山水库是密山垦区首批修建的中型水库之一。修建这个水库的主要是转业、复员军人，干劲很足很猛，有些人还有一定的施工经验。但领导上过去没有充分发挥他们的积极性和创造性。密山农垦局没有强调水库由党委全盘领导；水库工程处的中共党委听任工程师和技术员决定问题；而这些技术人员又机械地执行农垦部发下来的施工规程，忽视了多快好省的一致性，孤立地、片面地追求工程“质量”。因此，施工效率很低。
    农垦部、农垦局和各农场三级领导干部，从水库职工们提出的意见中和亲身劳动考察中，看到由于施工领导和工程设计上的官僚主义和保守思想，对水库的建设造成了少慢差费的后果。他们就当场采取具体措施进行纠正。他们依照政治挂帅、群众路线的领导思想，在现场职工代表会议上作出决议：用党委统一领导、各施工中队分段包干、限期完工的办法代替技术人员监工的办法，取消一切阻碍施工大跃进的清规戒律，放宽大坝上土含水量的百分比限制；把现场职工代表会议作为党委领导下的常设组织，通过这个组织发动全体职工进行技术革命，改革工具，推动施工的大跃进。
    这些措施使职工们的积极性大为高涨。施工效率从每人每日完成两立方很难取运的重粘土土方工程一，跃提高到四立方。职工们提出保证，一定要在最短时间内继续将施工效率提高一倍到两倍，在“八一”建军节前完成第一期工程全部五十四万立方土方工程，把洪水拦在云山脚下。职工们人人献计、个个出主意来改革工具、改进操作方法，以便迅速提高施工效率。密山农垦局过去没有为工地职工进行技术革命、改革工具提供方便条件，现在他们立即运了大批铁工工具和木工工具到工地，分发到各个施工中队。密山农场和八五二农场认识到大量培养技术工人的重要性，就决定抽派木工和铁工到水库工地来，一方面带徒弟，一方面学本事。八五二农场有一个时候因为缺少拖拉机手，使有些拖拉机的利用率不高，这个农场的党委书记李桂莲在现场整风中看到水库工地上有些修过小型水库和机场跑道的转业军人提出了很好的意见，便联想到自己的农场里有不少过去的坦克兵、汽车驾驶员，就下决心让这些人去开拖拉机。
    经过这次现场整风，领导干部共同切实体验到了社会主义建设总路线的伟大力量。密山农场场长计海秋说，他们在这里活生生地学习了怎样深入贯彻社会主义建设总路线，回场马上动手，群众的积极性一定能更充分地发挥出来。其余的领导干部也都表示要把这次现场整风的办法和心得运用到自己的工作中去，使生产全面大跃进的高潮一个紧跟一个。
    农垦部深入垦区的干部现在正继续进行现场整风。他们计划在垦区渡过一个农业生产季节，把问题解决透彻，提出各种改进领导作风、改进领导工作的根本措施，然后再返回农垦部。
