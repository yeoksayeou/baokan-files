Comrades from Lower Levels Write

    We Have Undergone Another Test
    Editor Comrades:
    During this intense summer harvest and planting season, the more than 200 cadres from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry who were sent to Miao Li Township in Zhengzhou, Henan, underwent the most strenuous physical labor battle since they were sent down five months ago. In the vast golden wheat fields, on the various threshing grounds piled high, and on other fronts, they fought tenaciously day and night alongside the veteran commune members.
    Summer harvesting and planting, especially wheat cutting, was a new task that many cadres sent to lower levels had never done before; however, because they mustered their energy, the difficulties were quickly overcome. Some comrades mastered the wheat cutting technique in a day or even a few hours, cutting as fast as the veteran commune members. Comrades such as Fu Yijie, who was sent down to Chenzhai Village, cut wheat until dawn for two nights during the four or five days of wheat cutting, and continued to work the next day. Comrade Wang Guangbin was seriously ill, and the comrades asked him to rest, but when he saw that heavy rain was coming, he did not want the fruits of half a year of hard work to be ruined by the rain. He resolutely joined other comrades in braving the rain to snatch and stack wheat piles, and repeatedly got up at night to patrol and protect the wheat. Wang Xichun, the deputy production captain of the seventh team in Miao Li Village, found on the last day of the summer harvest that there were still seventy mu of wheat that had not been harvested and that the wheat cutting task could not be completed on time. He led everyone to work hard from the morning of the previous day until the morning of the next day, completing the wheat harvesting task half a day ahead of schedule.
    On the threshing grounds, the cadres sent to lower levels did not show weakness either. Every night, cadres sent to lower levels were guarding the wheat on almost every threshing ground. Many comrades worked during the day and guarded the wheat at night. Comrades Li Chunlin and Yang Shaoxiong, who were sent to Shili Tun, moved their bedding to the threshing ground and guarded the threshing ground day and night. They never went home for a night during the month of threshing.
    Comrade Wu Ping, a cadre sent to lower levels who was elected as the deputy director of the Wangzhai Commune and recently named a model branch secretary of the Communist Youth League in Zhengzhou, immediately organized a youth shock brigade of the second production team to rush to plant rice after actively participating in the summer harvest. In order to solve the water problem for the paddy fields, she often went to the fields before dawn to repair canals and divert water, not returning home all day. In order to improve labor efficiency, she also used her brains to come up with a method of transplanting rice in sections, rationally allocating labor, and carrying out labor competitions. She also paid attention to ideological education for the young people. As a result, the eighteen young people under her leadership planted more than three mu of land in one afternoon, from ditching, pulling seedlings, and transplanting, which improved labor efficiency several times over.
    In order to liberate women's labor force and ensure the timely completion of the summer harvest and planting tasks, dozens of cadres sent to lower levels also helped farmers run busy farming canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens in their spare time. Now, almost every production team has busy farming canteens and nurseries set up by cadres sent to lower levels to assist farmers. Many comrades often stay up late to work on the canteen. Comrade Chen Xinfu of Shili Tun also moved his bedding to the canteen. He helped carry water, dig vegetables, and distribute steamed buns and dishes during the day, and got up in the middle of the night to help knead the dough.... Due to the establishment of canteens and nurseries, the attendance rate of women's labor force increased from 40% to 50% to more than 80%, and many villages even reached 100%, which powerfully ensured the completion of the summer harvest and planting tasks.

### 我们又经受了一次考验

专栏：下放干部来信

    我们又经受了一次考验编辑同志：
    在这次紧张的夏收夏种中，冶金工业部下放到河南郑州庙李乡的二百多位干部经受了一场下放五个月以来在体力劳动上最剧烈的战斗。在广阔的黄金色的麦地里，在各个堆得高高满满的打麦场上，以及在其他战线上，他们和老社员一起，夜以继日地顽强战斗着。
    夏收夏种，特别是割麦，对许多下放干部来说，都是从来没有干过的一项新的工作；但是由于他们鼓足了干劲，困难很快就被克服了。有些同志在一天甚至几小时内就掌握了割麦技术，割得和老社员一样快。下放到陈寨村的傅毅杰等同志，在割麦的四、五天当中，有两个晚上一直割到天亮，第二天仍继续劳动。王广滨同志生了重病，同志们让他休息，但他看到大雨快来了，不愿意让辛勤劳动半年的果实被雨糟蹋，坚决和其他同志一起冒雨抢垛麦堆，夜里还一再起来巡逻护麦。王熙春，是庙李村第七队的生产副队长，他在夏收的最后一天，发现还有七十亩小麦没有割完，不能按时完成割麦任务，就带动大家从头天上午一直苦战到第二天上午，提前半天完成了收麦任务。
    在打麦场上，下放干部同样没有示弱。每天夜里，几乎在每一个麦场上都有下放干部在护麦。许多同志是白天劳动、黑夜护麦。下放到十二里屯的李春林、杨绍雄等同志，他们把铺盖搬到打麦场里，昼夜守卫着麦场。他们在打麦的一个月当中，从没有回家住过一宿。
    被选为王寨社副社长、不久前被评为郑州市模范团支部书记的下放干部吴萍同志，在积极参加夏收以后，就立即组织第二生产队的青年突击队抢种水稻。为了解决稻地的用水问题，她经常天刚亮就到地里去修渠引水，整天不回家。为了提高劳动效率，她还开动脑筋想出了分片插秧办法，合理调配劳力，开展劳动竞赛，而且注意对青年进行思想教育，因此在她领导下的十八个青年，从打埂、拔秧、插秧，一个下午就种了三亩多地，使劳动效率提高了好几倍。
    为了解放妇女劳动力，保证及时完成夏收夏种任务，还有几十个下放干部，在劳动余暇，帮助农民办农忙食堂、托儿所、幼儿园。现在，几乎每一个生产队都有下放干部协助农民办起的农忙食堂、托儿所。许多同志为了办好食堂，往往忙到深夜还不休息。十二里屯的陈新福同志，还把铺盖搬到食堂去住，他白天帮忙挑水、挖菜、分馍分菜，半夜里还起来帮助和面……。由于成立了食堂、托儿所，妇女劳力的出勤率由40％到50％提高到80％以上，许多村甚至达到100％，有力地保证了夏收夏种任务的完成。
