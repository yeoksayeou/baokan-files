Munich's "Süddeutsche Zeitung" pointed out in a commentary that the American and British intervention in the Arab East demonstrates the weakness of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The newspaper severely refuted the American excuse that the dispatch of troops was based on Lebanon's request for assistance, recalling that Hitler in the past was also often "requested to provide assistance." The newspaper warned that Washington and London should understand that "President Chamoun and King Hussein, who rely on foreign bayonets for support, cannot maintain power for long. Their existence through violence can only increase the Arab people's hatred of the West and accelerate the Arab people's movement for unification."

The newspaper also expressed dissatisfaction with the use of the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany as a base for American military operations.

    希特勒也曾被别人“请求给予援助”
    但是外国刺刀不能保持反人民政权
    慕尼黑的“南德意志报”在评论中指出，美英对阿拉伯东方的干涉表明北大西洋集团的软弱。报纸严厉驳斥了美国所谓出兵是根据黎巴嫩要求援助的借口，它追述道，过去希特勒也常常被别人“请求给予援助”。报纸警告说，华盛顿和伦敦应该明白，“依靠外国刺刀来支持的夏蒙总统和侯赛因国王是不能长久保持政权的。他们依靠暴力的存在只能更增加阿拉伯人对西方的仇恨和加速阿拉伯人争取统一的运动”。
    这家报纸对于把德意志联邦共和国的领土用作美国军事行动的根据地一事也表示不满。
