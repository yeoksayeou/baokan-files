Cooperation Brings a Great Harvest in Animal Husbandry
Xilin Gol League's Net Livestock Increase is Ten Times Last Year's

According to the Inner Mongolia Daily: Good news of a bumper harvest in animal husbandry has spread throughout the Xilin Gol Grassland, one of China's three major pastures. According to preliminary statistics, the net increase of various livestock in Xilin Gol League this year is 10%, which is ten times the net increase rate of last year; the total number of livestock has jumped from 3.33 million in 1957 to 3.66 million.

During the spring and summer this year, Xilin Gol League organized a production and construction team of more than a thousand people, boldly mobilized the masses, went deep into reality, and launched a league-wide high tide of animal husbandry cooperation in mid-May. In just fifty-five days, the league basically realized animal husbandry cooperation. The vigorous development of cooperation directly promoted the bumper harvest of animal husbandry production. For example, the Aogansil Livestock Farm in Sunit Right Banner, which has suffered from natural disasters for years, has changed from production reduction to bumper production. It has jumped from a serious situation of a 23% decrease in livestock in 1957 to a 21% net increase in livestock this year.

Since liberation, animal husbandry production in Xilin Gol League has achieved unprecedented leaps and bounds. However, the situation in the past three years has been high at both ends and low in the middle, forming a saddle shape. In 1956, with the nationwide high tide of agricultural cooperation, pilot animal husbandry cooperatives and joint state-private animal farms were established, vigorously developing year-round mutual aid groups in animal husbandry, and carrying out a production increase and animal protection campaign centered on mutual assistance and cooperation. Animal husbandry production has greatly developed. By 1957, the situation had changed: At that time, some cadres were Right-leaning and conservative, underestimated the awareness of the herdsmen, advocated that the speed of cooperation should be slower rather than faster, and the development of cooperation should be less rather than more. They emphasized that Xilin Gol League was backward, special, and had poor conditions, so it lacked revolutionary vigor, and specific measures did not keep up with the needs of production development, and the net livestock increase rate suddenly dropped to 0.96%. Last winter and this spring, the CPC Xilin Gol League Committee, in accordance with the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction, more thoroughly criticized Right-leaning conservative ideology, broke the theory of backwardness, the theory of specialness, and the theory of poor conditions, and quickly launched a high tide of cooperation, finally achieving this year's bumper harvest.

Now, the vast number of herdsmen in Xilin Gol League are basically victoriously completing the first five-year plan, and on the basis of firing the first shot of the second five-year plan, they are going all out to develop the league's livestock to ten million head in the next five years.

    合作化带来牧业生产大丰收
    锡盟牲畜纯增率等于去年十倍
    据内蒙古日报讯  我国三大牧场之一的锡林郭勒大草原上，传遍了畜牧业大丰收的喜讯。据初步统计，今年锡林郭勒盟各种牲畜纯增了10％，等于去年纯增率的十倍；牲畜总头数已从1957年的三百三十三万头，跃达三百六十六万头。
    锡林郭勒盟在今年春夏期间，组织了千余人的生产建社大军，放手发动群众，深入实际，从5月中旬掀起了全盟性的牧业合作化高潮，仅仅经过五十五天，全盟就基本上实现了牧业合作化；合作化的蓬勃发展，又直接促进了畜牧业生产的大丰收。例如，连年遭受自然灾害的苏尼特右旗敖干西勒牧业社，就一变减产为丰产，由1957年度牲畜下降23％的严重局面，一跃为今年纯增牲畜21％。
    解放以来，锡林郭勒盟畜牧业生产得到了空前飞跃的发展，但是，近三年的情况是两头高中间低，形成了马鞍形。1956年，随着全国农业合作化高潮，试办了牧业社和公私合营牧场，大力发展了牧业常年互助组，开展了以互助合作为中心的增产保畜运动，畜牧业生产有了很大发展。到了1957年，情况就发生了变化：当时有些干部右倾保守，对牧民的觉悟估计不足，主张合作化的速度慢比快好、合作化的发展少比多好，强调锡林郭勒盟落后、特殊、条件差，因而缺乏革命干劲，具体措施也没赶上生产发展的需要，牲畜纯增率便骤然下降到0.96％。去冬今春，中共锡林郭勒盟委员会，根据党的社会主义建设总路线的精神，比较彻底地批判了右倾保守思想，打破了落后论、特殊论和条件论，迅速地掀起了合作化的高潮，终于获得了今年的大丰收。
    现在，锡林郭勒盟广大牧民，正在基本上胜利完成了第一个五年计划，已经在打响第二个五年计划头一炮的基础上，全力以赴，决心在今后五年内把全盟牲畜发展到一千万头。
