Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 1st: The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory announced that the American small satellite "Explorer III," launched on March 26, apparently burned up on the night of June 27 or the morning of June 28. As of the 29th, however, no reports had been received of anyone witnessing its disintegration.

Prior to this, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory had notified amateur observers to intensify their observations of the small satellite's fall, but no one was able to see this small object, only two hundred and three centimeters long.

    美国小卫星陨灭
    据新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：美国史密森氏天体物理天文台宣布，美国在3月26日发射的小卫星“探险者三号”，显然已经在6月27日夜晚或28日早晨陨灭。虽然，到29日，还没有收到报告说有人看到它陨灭。
    在这以前，史密森氏天体物理天文台曾通报业余观测者加紧观测这个小卫星的陨落，但是没有人能看到这个只有二百零三公分长的小玩意。
