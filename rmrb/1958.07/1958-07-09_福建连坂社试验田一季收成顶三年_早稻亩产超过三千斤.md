Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 8th July: The Lianban Agricultural Commune in Minhou County, Fujian, has set a new record for early rice yield, producing 3,054 jin, 7 liang, and 5 qian of dry grain per mu.

The experimental plot cultivated by Huang Baoluo, the head of the Lianban Commune, along with a group of young commune members and cadres, was originally planned to yield 2,000 jin per mu. Before the harvest, during a field inspection and comparison across the township, it was discovered that this plot of early rice was a scene of "only rice ears and no leaves," with the seedlings growing very robustly. It was estimated that the yield could reach 2,500 jin per mu. As the harvest approached, commune cadres and members conducted a final inspection of the field, picking ears and weighing grains. They found that the rice had large ears, heavy grains, and full kernels, with 14,200 grains weighing one jin. Therefore, the estimated yield was further increased to 3,000 jin per mu. When the harvest began, Wen Fushan, a member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Xu Lijin, the First Secretary of the Minhou County Party Committee, cadres from the Fujian Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Fujian Agricultural College, as well as township and commune cadres and members, all came to jointly measure the land and weigh the grain. The result was that this 1.35 mu of early rice yielded a total of 4,123 jin and 9 liang and 3 qian of dry grain, averaging 3,054 jin, 7 liang and 5 qian per mu, more than double the 915 jin per mu of early rice last year. Liu Shishou, a 71-year-old farmer who originally did not believe that this plot could achieve such a high yield, also came specifically to participate in the weighing and carefully inspected the harvested rice. He happily said: "One season equals three years of harvest, this is something I never imagined, only in the world led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao could this happen!"

Huang Baoluo and others, who led the effort to create the record early rice yield, introduced the process they went through to achieve the high yield to those who came to participate in the inspection. In 1952, the early rice yield of this experimental plot was 909 jin per mu, and last year it was 915 jin. For several years, there was a mindset that increasing production had reached its limit. This spring, encouraged by the situation of the Great Leap Forward, Huang Baoluo led a group of daring young commune members and cadres to break through this conservative barrier and vigorously carry out technical reforms. While others adopted small-sized close planting, they adopted "6×6 double-cluster large-sized close planting," planting more than 330,000 clusters per mu, more than double or triple the past. While others were afraid that applying too much fertilizer would cause lodging and did not dare to apply large amounts of fertilizer, they, in addition to paying attention to the application of human manure, applied large amounts of local miscellaneous fertilizers containing various ingredients, and adopted deep plowing and layered fertilization. In order to prevent lodging, they inserted 1,000 bamboo poles into the field to support all the rice plants, thus achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest. (Attached picture)

### 福建连坂社试验田一季收成顶三年  早稻亩产超过三千斤

    福建连坂社试验田一季收成顶三年
    早稻亩产超过三千斤
    新华社福州8日电  福建闽侯县连坂农业社出现了早稻亩产干谷三千零五十四斤七两五钱的新纪录。
    连坂社社长黄宝洛和一批青年社员和干部等共同种植的一丘试验田，原计划亩产二千斤。收获前，全乡进行田间检查评比时，发现这丘早稻“只见稻穗不见叶”，禾苗长得十分茁壮，估产每亩可达二千五百斤。临到收割的时候，社干部和社员们又最后一次进行田间摘穗和秤谷粒检查，只见稻子穗大、粒重、颗粒饱满，一万四千二百粒就有一斤，因此估产又提高到每亩三千斤。开镰收割时，中共福建省委委员温附山、闽侯县委第一书记许力进和福建省农业科学研究所、福建农学院的干部，乡、社干部，社员等都来共同丈量土地和过秤。结果，这一亩三分五厘早稻，共收获四千一百二十三斤九两三钱干谷，平均每亩三千零五十四斤七两五钱，比去年早稻亩产九百一十五斤增加了两倍多。原来不相信这丘田能得到高额丰产的七十一岁老农刘世寿，也特地前来参加过秤，仔细地检查了收下的稻谷。他高兴地说：“一季等于三年的收成，这是我从来没有想到的事，只有在共产党和毛主席领导的天下，才会有的呵！”
    领导创造早稻丰产纪录的黄宝洛等，向前来参加验收的人介绍了他们争取高额丰产的经过。1952年，这丘试验田早稻亩产是九百零九斤，去年是九百一十五斤。几年来存在着增产到顶的思想。今年春季，在大跃进形势鼓舞下，黄宝洛带领一批敢作敢为的青年社员和干部，决心打破这一保守关，大搞技术改革，别人采用小株密植，他们采用“6×6双丛大株密植”，每亩插秧三十三万多丛，比过去增加一倍到两倍多。别人怕施肥过多会倒伏，不敢大量施肥，他们除注意人粪尿的施用外，大量施用含有各种成分的土杂肥，并采取了深翻土和分层施肥。为了防止倒伏，他们在田里插下一千根竹竿，把稻禾全部架起来，因而获得了空前大丰收。（附图片）
