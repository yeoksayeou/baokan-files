Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 26th: "Al-Ahram" today published a shocking secret cable revealing the U.S. plot to sabotage and isolate the United Arab Republic and to carry out aggression in the Middle East.

The newspaper published a facsimile of the secret cable from the U.S. State Department to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, signed by William Rountree, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, dated Washington, April 18, 1958. According to "Al-Ahram" editor Haikal, the cable was issued by the State Department to all U.S. diplomatic representatives in the Middle East in the form of a circular.

Under the title "Secret Security Situation," "Al-Ahram" published the following summary of this U.S. State Department document:

	“1. The State Department reiterates that the basic goal of U.S. policy toward the United Arab Republic remains unchanged. The State Department re-emphasizes that the expansion of Egyptian sphere of influence is contrary to the joint resolution of the U.S. Congress on the Middle East, strengthens Arab nationalism, encourages anti-Western, especially anti-American, tendencies in the Middle East and Africa, undermines the Baghdad Pact, a vital link in the free world’s strategic network, and harms the position of Israel, whose interests the United States absolutely cannot ignore.

	“2. The fact that actual control of the transport of Middle Eastern oil to Europe via the Suez Canal and through all pipelines leading to the Mediterranean is now concentrated in Cairo seriously jeopardizes U.S. interests in the region. The United Arab Republic is now able to exert pressure on the United States and other Western countries. If President Nasser should side with the Soviet bloc in the future, this possibility could become a formidable weapon in his hands.

	“4. Under the current circumstances, continuing the previous approach to the United Arab Republic will only provoke the Arab countries and push them into the arms of the Soviet Union. Therefore, some changes must be made in the way we implement our policy. The question is to bring about some 'relaxation' in our relations with the United Arab Republic. Of course, this is by no means a fundamental re-evaluation of our policy; it is a temporary tactical change made out of necessity. Therefore, consideration is currently being given to unfreezing Egyptian funds in the United States, relaxing restrictions on trade with the United Arab Republic, and some other measures.

	If we can convince Nasser that the United States has agreed to his rule and is now willing to accept his terms, the inevitable result will be a cooling of the United Arab Republic's relations with the communist bloc. This is possible, as can be seen from many statements made by Egypt (even by Nasser himself), namely that the close relationship between Egypt and Russia stems from the West's refusal to cooperate with Egypt on Egypt's terms. An improvement in U.S. relations with the United Arab Republic will inevitably arouse suspicion in the Kremlin and may eventually weaken or even completely destroy the United Arab Republic's relationship with the Soviet Union.

	“6. It is essential to continue unremitting efforts to discredit the idea of a federation between Syria and Egypt in order to alienate the two countries, as our main goal in the region remains to split Syria and Egypt. It is essential to tirelessly consolidate internal forces with Western ideals and foreign forces that can intervene in possible events within the United Arab Republic at the appropriate time. It must be remembered that the disintegration of the United Arab Republic will not only end the fate of Nasser's Egypt, but will also make it easier for us to repel Arab nationalism, regardless of the form or style it may take in the Middle East.

	“7. Our efforts will obviously be more successful if we can isolate the United Arab Republic from the rest of the Arab world. Therefore, the task of U.S. diplomatic and propaganda personnel in Arab countries is to spread the general belief that the United Arab Republic constitutes a direct threat to the current governments of Arab countries. In monarchical countries, it must be forcefully argued that the strengthening of the United Arab Republic may lead to the downfall of the ruling dynasties; in republican countries, every means must be used to emphasize the fear of being annexed by the Cairo military government. Finally, the Iraq-Jordan Federation will continue to receive U.S. support against the Syria-Egypt Federation.

	“8. This circular provides general guidance to U.S. diplomatic representatives in the Middle East. More detailed instructions will be given to individual representatives separately.”
Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 26th: "Al-Ahram" published today a report from the newspaper's Baghdad correspondent stating that secret documents seized after the Iraqi revolution showed that the Baghdad Pact group had drafted detailed plans to invade the Syrian region in cooperation with the former Iraqi dynasty and Turkey, and had already spent 17 million Egyptian pounds in an attempt to overthrow the regime in the Syrian region.

The correspondent also said that the Iraqi Republican government had only detained 56 people during the revolution. The government detained these people because angry people would kill them. The correspondent denounced the imperialists for spreading malicious propaganda that the Iraqi Republican government had arrested thousands of people and killed hundreds.

### 美国危害阿联的阴谋大暴露  开罗“金字塔报”公布美国务院密电

    美国危害阿联的阴谋大暴露
    开罗“金字塔报”公布美国务院密电
    新华社开罗26日电　“金字塔报”今天公布了美国策划破坏、孤立阿拉伯联合共和国和侵略中东阴谋的一封触目惊心的秘密电报。
    在这家报纸刊登的由美国国务院发给美国驻巴格达大使馆的这封秘密电报的影印副本上，有美国中东事务助理国务卿威廉·朗特里的签名，日期是华盛顿1958年4月18日。据“金字塔报”主编海卡尔指出，这封电报是以通告的形式由国务院发给美国驻中东的所有外交代表的。
    “金字塔报”以“秘密安全情况”为题公布美国国务院的这个文件的摘要如下：
      “一、国务院重申，美国对阿拉伯联合共和国政策的基本目标维持不变。国务院再次强调，埃及势力范围的扩张是同美国国会联席会议关于中东的决议相违背的，是加强阿拉伯民族主义的，是鼓励在中东和非洲的反西方、特别是反美的倾向的，是破坏自由世界战略网中重要一环巴格达条约的，是损害以色列的地位的，而以色列的利益是美国绝对不能忽视的。
    “二，中东石油通过苏伊士运河和通过所有通向地中海的油管输向欧洲的运输的实际控制权现在集中在开罗，这个事实严重地危及了美国在这个地区的利益。阿拉伯联合共和国现在能够对美国和其他西方国家施加压力。如果纳赛尔总统将来投靠苏联集团，那么这种可能性就能够成为他手中的一个可畏的武器。
    “四、在目前情况下，继续采取以前对阿拉伯联合共和国的方针只会激怒阿拉伯各国而把它们推入苏联的怀抱。因此在执行我国政策的方法上必须作某些改变。问题是使我国同阿拉伯联合共和国的关系有一些‘缓和’。当然这绝不是说要对我国政策从根本上进行重新估计；这是出于必要而作的一种策略上的暂时改变。因此目前正在考虑解冻埃及在美国的款项，放宽对阿拉伯联合共和国贸易的限制，以及一些其他措施。
    如果我们能够使纳赛尔相信美国已经同意了他的统治、现在愿意接受他的条件，那么不可避免的结果将是阿拉伯联合共和国同共产党集团的关系冷淡下来。这种情况是可能的，这可以从埃及发表的许多声明（甚至纳赛尔本人发表的声明）中看出来，那就是埃及和俄国的紧密关系是西方拒绝根据埃及的条件同埃及合作的根源。美国同阿拉伯联合共和国关系的改善必然会在克里姆林宫引起猜疑，最后可能削弱或者甚至完全破坏阿拉伯联合共和国同苏联的关系。
    “六、必需继续不懈地努力使叙利亚和埃及建立联邦的思想信誉扫地，以便离间这两个国家，因为我们在这个地区的主要目标仍然是分裂叙利亚和埃及。必须不懈地巩固具有西方理想的内部力量和可以在适当时机干涉阿拉伯联合共和国国内可能发生的事件的国外力量。必须记住，阿拉伯联合共和国的瓦解不仅将结束纳赛尔埃及的命运，而且也将使我们较容易地击退阿拉伯民族主义，不管它在中东可能采取什么形式或式样。
    “七、如果使阿拉伯联合共和国脱离阿拉伯世界其他国家而孤立，我们的努力显然将较容易获得成功。因此，美国驻阿拉伯国家的外交和宣传人员的任务就是散布这样一种总的信念：阿拉伯联合共和国构成对目前阿拉伯各国政府的直接威胁。在君主国家，必须有力地阐述阿拉伯联合共和国的增强可能造成当政王朝的倒台；在共和国家内，必须用一切方法强调被开罗军政府并吞的恐惧。最后，伊拉克—约旦联邦将继续获得美国的支持来反对叙利亚—埃及联邦。
    “八、目前这分通告对美国驻中东的外交代表提供了总的方针。较为详细的指示将分别交给各个代表。”
    新华社开罗26日电　开罗“金字塔报”今天刊载的这家报纸驻巴格达记者的报道说，在伊拉克革命以后缴获的秘密文件表明，巴格达条约集团已经拟就了在前伊拉克王朝和土耳其合作下侵犯叙利亚地区的详细计划，并且已经使用了一千七百万埃镑企图实现推翻叙利亚地区的政权的阴谋。
    这位记者还说，伊拉克共和国政府在革命过程中只拘留了五十六个人。政府拘留这些人是因为愤怒的人民会把他们杀掉。这位记者斥责帝国主义者在他们发动的恶毒的宣传运动中胡说伊拉克共和国政府逮捕了好几千人并且杀掉了好几百人。
