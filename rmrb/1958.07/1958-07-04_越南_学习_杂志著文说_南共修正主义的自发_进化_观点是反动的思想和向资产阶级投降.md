Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 22nd: The Vietnamese Labor Party's official publication, "Study" magazine, recently published an article entitled "On the Possibility of Achieving Socialist Revolution Through Peaceful Means," criticizing the South Communist Program's opportunist views on the issue of how to achieve socialist revolution.

The article stated that the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries made a brilliant and profound analysis of the possibility of achieving socialist revolution through peaceful means in some capitalist countries. This is an important contribution to the treasure house of Marxist-Leninist theory. However, the South Communist Program's view on the issue of achieving socialist revolution through peaceful means is indeed a right-leaning opportunist view, and it poses a great danger to the international socialist cause.

The article stated that in addition to being determined by the attitude and means adopted by the exploiting classes towards the revolution, the peaceful transition of the revolution must also have two other basic conditions: First, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen the leadership of the party as the vanguard of the working class. However, the revisionists of the South Communist Party believe that capitalism can spontaneously transition to socialism. They believe that the working class does not need to overthrow the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, but only needs to so-called "strive for leadership in the existing power institutions." The so-called existing power institutions refer to the state institutions of the bourgeoisie. The South Communist revisionists have not seen, or are unwilling to see, the class nature of the power in capitalist countries. Their so-called theory of "evolution" and the fallacy that the working class can seize state power peacefully are no different in any fundamental way from the views of the revisionists of the Second International who surrendered to the bourgeoisie and betrayed the interests of the working class and the working people.

The article stated that the revolutionary actions of the people are conscious and never spontaneous or blind. Without the leadership of a Marxist-Leninist party, there would be no conscious revolutionary struggle of the masses, and there would be no socialism. Promoting the theory of "evolution" is a denial of the conscious revolutionary action of the masses. The essence of this "theory" is to maintain capitalism and deny socialist revolution and socialism.

The great achievements of the international communist movement in the past fifty years are the result of the correct leadership of Marxist-Leninist parties. Without the leadership of a Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism, the workers and working people of the world cannot achieve any victories. The bourgeoisie sees this most clearly, and therefore they have long tried every possible means to sabotage and eliminate the Communist Parties of all countries. If the fallacies of the South Communist revisionists could deceive people, the international bourgeoisie would applaud.

The article pointed out that another basic condition for achieving a peaceful transition of the revolution is to establish a broad united front of the people on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class, and to launch a vigorous revolutionary upsurge. The socialist revolutionary movement is a broad mass movement carried out by the working class under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party. Without the revolutionary struggle of the masses, socialism cannot be victorious. Therefore, the party must mobilize and organize the masses to strive for the peaceful achievement of the revolution, while at the same time preparing for fierce battles until the final overthrow of the state institutions of the bourgeoisie, and replace the bourgeois dictatorship with the proletarian dictatorship. However, the leading group of the South Communist Party believes that the current state of the bourgeoisie is not a bourgeois dictatorship, but is becoming an ultra-class institution. The working class only needs to gain a "leading" position in the "original power institutions" to achieve socialist revolution. Thus, they oppose the revolutionary struggle methods of the masses to parliamentary struggle methods. However, Marxists believe that a revolutionary movement that is divorced from the broad masses is merely a reformist trick that will not touch a single hair of the bourgeoisie, but will only serve to麻醉 (mázùi - anesthetize, or lull) the masses. The South Communist revisionists' spontaneous "evolution" viewpoint is nothing but a reactionary illusion. While true Marxists are working hard to achieve socialist revolution through peaceful means, they are also always prepared to use violence to counter the violence of the bourgeoisie. Any one-sided view on this issue is extremely wrong.

### 越南“学习”杂志著文说  南共修正主义的自发“进化”观点是反动的思想和向资产阶级投降

    越南“学习”杂志著文说
    南共修正主义的自发“进化”观点是反动的思想和向资产阶级投降
    新华社河内6月22日电　越南劳动党机关刊物“学习”杂志最近一期刊载了一篇题为“论通过和平方式实现社会主义革命的可能性”的文章，批判了南共纲领在实现社会主义革命的方式问题上的机会主义观点。
    文章说，各国共产党、工人党莫斯科会议宣言对一些资本主义国家通过和平方式实现社会主义革命的可能性作了精辟而深刻的分析。这是对马克思列宁主义理论宝库的一个重要贡献。但是，南共纲领对通过和平方式实现社会主义革命这个问题的看法确确实实是右倾机会主义的观点，它对国际社会主义事业具有极大的危害性。
    文章说，革命的和平转变除了决定于剥削阶级对革命采取的态度和手段这个因素之外，还必须具有另外两个基本条件：首先是，必须大力加强作为工人阶级先锋队的政党的领导。但是南共的修正主义分子却认为资本主义可以自发地转入社会主义。他们认为，工人阶级不必推翻资产阶级专政，而只要所谓“争取在现有政权机构中的领导作用”。所谓现有的政权机构就是指的资产阶级的国家机构。南共修正主义分子没有看到，或者不愿意看到资本主义国家的政权的阶级性。他们所谓的“进化”论和工人阶级和平夺取国家政权的谬论同投降资产阶级、背叛工人阶级和劳动人民利益的第二国际的修正主义分子的观点没有任何根本区别。
    文章说，人民群众的革命行动是自觉的，绝不是自发和盲目的。没有马列主义政党的领导，就没有群众的自觉的革命斗争，也就不会有社会主义。宣传“进化”论就是否认了群众自觉的革命行动。这种“理论”的实质是维护资本主义，否认社会主义革命和社会主义。
    国际共产主义运动近五十年来所取得的伟大成就是马列主义政党实行正确的领导的结果。没有以马克思列宁主义武装起来的共产党的领导，世界工人和劳动人民就不能取得任何胜利。资产阶级对这一点看得最清楚，因此他们长期以来总是千方百计、不择手段地企图破坏和消灭各国共产党。如果南共修正主义分子的那套谬论骗得了人的话，国际资产阶级该会拍手称快了。
    文章指出，实现革命的和平转变必须具备的另一个基本条件是，在有工人阶级领导的、工农联盟的基础上建立广泛的人民统一战线，并且掀起一个蓬蓬勃勃的革命高潮。社会主义革命运动是工人阶级在马克思列宁主义政党领导下进行的广泛的群众运动。没有群众的革命斗争，社会主义就不能取得胜利。因此，党要发动和组织群众，争取以和平方式实现革命，同时要准备激烈的战斗，直到最后推翻资产阶级的国家机构，以无产阶级专政来代替资产阶级专政。但是，南共领导集团却认为，目前资产阶级的国家不是资产阶级专政，而是正在成为超阶级的机构。工人阶级只要取得“原有政权机构”中的“领导”地位就算是实现社会主义革命了。于是，他们把群众的革命斗争方式和议会斗争方式对立起来。但是，马克思主义者认为，脱离了广大群众的革命运动，就只是改良主义的把戏，这种把戏连资产阶级的一根毫毛也不会触动，而只会起麻醉群众的作用。南共修正主义分子的自发的“进化”的观点只不过是一种反动的幻想罢了。真正的马克思主义者在努力争取以和平方式实现社会主义革命的同时，也随时准备用暴力来对付资产阶级的暴力。在这个问题上的任何片面看法都是极端错误的。
