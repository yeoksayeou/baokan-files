Characters: Children writing slogans A, B, C, D, E.
　　　Children shouting slogans A, B, C.
　　　A child selling soda, Fu Lü.
Time: Around dawn.
Location: A quiet street corner in Beirut.

(Curtain rises. An American patrolman walks by. After a short pause, children writing slogans A, B, C, D, and E enter.)

A: Look, this is a good spot. Let's write a big slogan here, what do you say?
All: Good!
B: What should we write?
C: Let's write this: We are Lebanese children, we will never allow American devils to invade!
A: No, that's too long and not strong enough. Let's just write: American devils get out!
All: Right! Write it quickly!
A: (To D and E) You keep watch, (to B and C) we'll write.
(D and E stand at the two corners, looking out.)
(A, B, and C prepare to write the slogan. A rides on B's shoulders, C hands A the brush and paint bucket. Just as A is about to write—)
E: Here comes an American patrolman!
D: Quick, get down!
(A jumps down from B's shoulders.)
(American patrolman enters.)
Soldier: What are you doing? What are you doing?
(The children glare at the soldier.)
Soldier: You little bastards, let me tell you, this is American Lebanon, this is American Beirut! Speak, if you don't speak, I'll shoot you! (Aims gun at them.)
(The children glare at the soldier.)
Soldier: What's wrong, are you mute?
(Loud slogans are heard from outside: American devils get out!...)
Soldier: Ah! (Runs towards the source of the slogans) I'll kill you! (Exits)
A: Don't be afraid, let's write again!
(As they prepare to write the slogan again, children shouting slogans A, B, and C enter.)
Slogan-Shouting A: Ha, so it's you!
Slogan-Writing A: Were you the ones shouting slogans just now?
Slogan-Shouting A: Yes, we saw him pointing a gun at a group of children over there, we were furious! Be careful, he's still wandering around over there looking for us.
Slogan-Writing A: That guy is really hateful, we have to teach him a lesson!
Slogan-Shouting A: Have you seen Fu Lü?
Slogan-Writing A: No, what's up?
Slogan-Shouting A: There's something important we need him for, come on, I'll tell you—
(Fu Lü enters.)
Fu: Selling soda! Selling soda, sweet, fragrant, and refreshing!
Slogan-Shouting A: Fu Lü! I was just looking for you!
Fu: Ha, everyone's here.
Slogan-Shouting A: Are you ready?
Fu: Ready. Look, here are nine bottles of soda, one of them is— (whispering) explosive! But there are too many American soldiers over there, it won't work. I want to find a lone one to get him.
Slogan-Writing A: I'll tell you, there's one here.
Fu: Where?
Slogan-Shouting A: Look, he's coming.
Fu: Good, watch me!
Slogan-Shouting A: Everyone hide first!
(Everyone except Fu Lü exits.)
Fu: Selling soda! Selling soda!
(American patrolman enters.)
Fu: Drink soda, sweet, fragrant, and refreshing!
Soldier: Give me two bottles!
Fu: Yes, yes! (Gives the soldier two bottles of soda.)
Soldier: Did you see a group of children just now?
Fu: Well, it seemed like they went that way. (Deliberately points in the wrong direction.)
Soldier: Hmm, good for you! (Walks while drinking soda.)
Fu: Hey, how come you're not paying?
Soldier: Bastard! (Exits)
Fu: Okay, go ahead and drink it, consider it my bad luck!
(The others enter.)
Slogan-Writing A: Hey, how come it didn't explode?
Fu: The one that explodes is another bottle, he hasn't drunk that one yet!
Slogan-Shouting A: Are you sure you didn't make a mistake, you gave it to him?
Fu: No mistake, no mistake! (To outside) Look, he finished the first bottle, now he's going to drink that one! Listen to me count to ten, and it should explode! Damn, why is he sitting down, not drinking it?
Slogan-Writing A: Oh no, this is really frustrating!
Slogan-Shouting A: (Softly to outside) Drink it, American devil, drink it!
All: (Softly to outside) Drink it, American devil, drink it!
Fu: Look, he's going to drink it, he's opening the bottle!
All: He drank it! He drank it!
Fu: Shh! Listen to me count: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten—
(An explosion! The soldier yells "Ouch!" Fu: Looks like he hurt his eyes, he's coming with his eyes covered!
Slogan-Writing A: That's great! (To B) You write the slogan, (to D and E) you keep watch. Hey, let's teach him a lesson!
(The soldier enters, covering his eyes.)
Soldier: Ouch! You little bastards, I'll kill you... (Bumps into a wall.) Ouch! Ouch! These little bastards...
Fu: (Pushes the soldier) You're the bastard!
Soldier: Ah, you're here! I'm going to—
Slogan-Writing A: (Punches the soldier) Get out of here!
Slogan-Shouting A: I'm going to beat you! (Hits the soldier with the large slogan-writing brush.)
Soldier: Ah, you—
Fu: Get out, (kicks the soldier in the butt.)
Go back!
(So everyone punches and kicks the soldier. By this time, the slogan is written: "American devils get out!")
Slogan-Shouting A: American devils get out!
All: American devils get out!
