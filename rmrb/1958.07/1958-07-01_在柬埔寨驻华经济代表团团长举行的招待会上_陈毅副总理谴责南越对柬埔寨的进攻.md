Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Vice Premier Chen Yi condemned the attack on Cambodia by the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem troops at a reception held this evening by Yang Ann, head of the Cambodian Economic Delegation to China, and pointed out that final victory will surely belong to the Cambodian people. Tonight's reception was hosted by head of delegation, Yang Ann, for the Cambodian Buddhist Delegation to China, the Delegation of Journalists to China, and the Parliamentary Delegation passing through Beijing.
After Yang Ann, head of the delegation, spoke at the reception, Vice Premier Chen Yi referred to the incident of South Vietnam attacking Cambodia and said that he, on behalf of the Chinese government, pointed out that in this incident, the aggressor was the Ngo Dinh Diem side. South Vietnam is one of the new hotbeds of war for imperialism, and the occurrence of this incident is not accidental. We firmly believe that justice is on the side of the Cambodian people, and I further believe that the Cambodian people will surely receive the support of peace-loving people and countries all over the world. Final victory belongs to the Cambodian people.
Vice Premier Chen Yi also said that during their visit to China, Cambodian friends will surely see the sincere friendship of the peace-loving Chinese people towards the peace-loving Cambodian people.
Yang Ann, head of the delegation, spoke first at the beginning of the reception. He expressed his great pleasure at the simultaneous arrival of the three delegations to China and firmly believed that it would enhance the friendly relations between Cambodia and China. He then said that just as the three Cambodian delegations came to China for a friendly visit, and just when friendship between the people alone can contribute to maintaining peace, the South Vietnamese troops have been invading the Cambodian border in recent days, which the Cambodian people are very indignant about. His Majesty King Norodom Suramarit recently issued an announcement to the world, pointing out the truth of the matter. In the final analysis, the future will make a conclusion, and peace-loving countries and people will express their opinions.
Also invited to the reception were Vice Chairmen Li Jishen and Shen Junru, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Ding Xilin, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China Zhao Puchu, and diplomatic envoys of various countries to China.

    在柬埔寨驻华经济代表团团长举行的招待会上
    陈毅副总理谴责南越对柬埔寨的进攻
    新华社30日讯　陈毅副总理今晚在柬埔寨驻华经济代表团团长杨安举行的招待会会上谴责南越吴庭艳军队对柬埔寨的进攻，并且指出最后胜利必定属于柬埔寨人民。今晚的招待会是杨安团长为柬埔寨佛教访华代表团、新闻工作者访华代表团访问中国和议会代表团路过北京而举行的。
    陈毅副总理在杨安团长在招待会上的讲话中谈到南越进攻柬埔寨的事件以后说，他代表中国政府指出，在这次事件中，进攻者是吴庭艳方面。南越是帝国主义的新战争策源地之一，发生这个事件并不是偶然的。我们坚信正义是在柬埔寨人民这一边，我更相信柬埔寨人民一定会得到全世界爱好和平的人民和国家的支持。最后胜利是属于柬埔寨人民的。
    陈毅副总理还说，柬埔寨的朋友们在中国访问期间，一定会看到爱好和平的中国人民对爱好和平的柬埔寨人民的真诚友谊。
    杨安团长在招待会开始时首先讲话，他对三个代表团同时来到中国表示十分高兴，并且深信必将增进柬中两国的友好关系。他接着说，正当柬埔寨的三个代表团到中国来进行友好访问的时候，正当只有人民间的友谊增进才能对维护和平作出贡献的时候，南越的军队这几天来正在进犯柬埔寨边境，柬埔寨人民对此十分愤慨，国王诺罗敦·苏拉玛里特陛下最近也已向全世界发出公告，指出了事实的真相。归根到底，未来将作出定论，爱好和平的国家和人民将表示他们的意见。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有副委员长李济深、沈钧儒，外交部副部长罗贵波，对外文化联络委员会副主任丁西林，中国佛教协会副会长赵朴初和各国驻华使节。
