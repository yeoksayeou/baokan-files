Xinhua News Agency, July 30th—Members of the Chinese Muslim Pilgrimage Delegation, who have just returned to Beijing from the Middle East, spoke to reporters today, angrily condemning the US-British imperialist aggression against the Middle East, and expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the Arab people against imperialist aggression.

They said: The strong will of the Arab people to defend national independence left a deep impression on the Chinese Muslim Pilgrimage Delegation. When they were in Egypt, they saw propaganda vehicles constantly appearing on the streets of Cairo, filled with people shouting slogans such as "Celebrating the establishment of the Iraqi Republic" and "Oppose US-British imperialism." On July 18th, the Chinese Muslim Pilgrimage Delegation and Egyptian Muslims jointly performed the Juma prayer at Al-Azhar Mosque. As soon as the prayer ended, elderly people and young people stood up and shouted slogans of "Oppose the atrocities of US-British imperialism." Many people were lifted up, walking and shouting.

    中国穆斯林朝觐团谴责美英侵略暴行
    据新华社30日讯　刚从中东地区回到北京的中国穆斯林朝觐团的人员，今天向本社记者发表谈话，愤怒谴责美英帝国主义对中东的侵略暴行，并表示坚决支持阿拉伯人民反抗帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。
    他们说：阿拉伯人民保卫民族独立的坚强意志，给中国穆斯林朝觐团留下了深刻印象。他们在埃及的时候，看到开罗街道上不断出现宣传车，车上站满了人，都高呼“庆祝伊拉克共和国成立”、“反对美英帝国主义”等口号。7月18日，中国穆斯林朝觐团曾经和埃及穆斯林在艾兹哈尔大寺共同礼主麻。礼拜刚一结束，便有老年人和青年人起来高呼“反对美英帝国主义的暴行”的口号，许多人被抬起来，边走边喊。
