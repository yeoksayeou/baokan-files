Xinhua News Agency, July 19th dispatch: Paris news: A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on the 18th that France currently does not intend to send troops to Lebanon. He said that as long as the lives and interests of French people are not under "direct threat," it has "no intention" of participating in the intervention in Lebanon.

However, the previous day, news reported that France had already sent a batch of warships near Beirut, preparing to land marines, but they were rejected by the commander of the American invading forces.

The above statement by the French Foreign Ministry spokesperson is considered a face-saving move by the French government. Many reports indicate that France is inherently very dissatisfied with the U.S. and Britain preventing it from intervening. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Paris on the 17th said that political figures in Paris "very much hope" to take "unified action" with the U.S. and Britain in the Middle East. These people shamelessly said that as a "standard" Western colonialist country, France should "fulfill its full responsibilities."

    美英不让法国插手
    法政府表示现“无意”参予干涉
    新华社19日讯  巴黎消息：法国外交部发言人18日说，法国目前不打算派兵去黎巴嫩。他说，只要法国人的生命和利益不受到“直接威胁”，它“无意”参加对黎巴嫩的干涉。
    但是前一天有消息说，法国已经派了一批军舰去贝鲁特附近，准备派海军陆战队登陆，他们被美国侵略军司令拒绝了。
    法国外交部发言人的上述声明被认为是法国政府遮盖颜面的一着，许多消息显示，法国对美、英不让它插手干涉的作法骨子里是很不满意的。法新社17日发自巴黎的一条消息说，巴黎的政界人士“十分希望”能够在中东地区同美英采取“一致行动”，这些人无耻地说，作为一个“标准的”西方殖民主义国家，法国应该“尽到它的全部责任”。
