Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang Telegram: The Jiangxi Province held its Second People's Congress, First Session from June 16th to 27th.

    The meeting heard the report on the work of the Provincial People's Committee delivered by Governor Shao Shiping, as well as other reports. In his report, Shao Shiping summarized the work of Jiangxi Province over the past four years, particularly emphasizing the extremely profound changes experienced in all aspects of work over the past year. He also briefly reported on the basic content of Jiangxi Province's Second Five-Year Plan, formulated according to the spirit of the General Line. Shao Shiping thoroughly analyzed the favorable conditions for Jiangxi Province to achieve its Second Five-Year Plan, and pointed out that in order to ensure the realization and early completion of this plan, it is currently necessary to immediately organize the people of the entire province to launch a vigorous mass technical revolution and cultural revolution, further mobilize the broad masses to break superstitions, liberate their minds, and cultivate a strong scientific and technological force and cultural force that is both red and expert from the working people. In the specific circumstances of Jiangxi Province, he said that the current technical revolution should focus on leading and organizing mass movements for tool improvement and technological innovation. Mass creations and inventions, whether large or small, should be valued and encouraged as long as they are beneficial to production.
    The delegates conducted enthusiastic discussions on Shao Shiping's government work report and other reports. They used a large number of facts and experiences from the Great Leap Forward to illustrate that as long as there is revolutionary vigor and the determination to strive for the top, any great difficulty can be overcome. For example, under the slogan of establishing industries in every county and the blooming of local industries everywhere, Ji'an City established more than seventy factories in three days; the suburbs of Jingdezhen City, after extensively tapping potential, established twenty-five factories with only 10,000 yuan. Xiajiang County, lacking engineering and technical personnel, found local experts and local engineers, learning as they went. Some people built a small blast furnace within two days after returning, and now there are more than a dozen blast furnaces in operation throughout the county. In agriculture, many miracles of high early rice yields have already appeared. Some counties can achieve an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu for early rice in one season alone. The delegates unanimously expressed that they will hold even higher the red flag of the General Line of Socialist Construction and advance courageously in the future.
    After full discussion, the meeting adopted six resolutions, including the work report of the Provincial People's Committee, the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, the 1958 national economic plan, the financial budget and final accounts, and the work report of the Provincial Higher People's Court.
    The meeting revoked the qualification of the rightist Luo Longji as a representative to the National People's Congress.
    The meeting elected Shao Shiping as Governor of Jiangxi Province, and Fang Zhichun, Huang Xian, Li Jieyong, Wang Zhuochao, Wang Dongxing, Rao Sicheng, Deng Hong, Peng Mengyu, and Ouyang Wu as Vice Governors of Jiangxi Province by secret ballot. Bai Dongcai, Liu Junxiu, Liu Jianhua, Liu Zhigang, Wei Xiuying, Shao Shiping, Li Youxiu, Wu Youxun, Wu Xuezhou, Chen Shaoxian, Chen Yike, Yi Ruisheng, Ma Tingshi, Guo Qingsi, Guo Qingfen, Xu Deheng, Huang Jiasi, Zhang Shiying, Cheng Xiaogang, Yang Weiyi, and Pan Zhenya were elected as representatives of Jiangxi Province to the Second National People's Congress. The meeting also elected Huang Zhizhen and forty other people as members of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee.

    江西举行二届一次人代会会议
    要求组织群众性的技术革命和文化革命
    新华社南昌电　江西省于6月16日到27日举行了第二届人民代表大会第一次会议。
    这次会议听取了省长邵式平的关于省人民委员会工作报告以及其他报告。邵式平在报告中总结了江西省近四年来的工作，特别着重阐明了在过去一年的工作中各方面所经历的极其深刻的变化。他还扼要地报告了根据总路线的精神制订的江西省第二个五年计划的基本内容。邵式平详尽地分析了江西省实现第二个五年计划的有利条件，并且指出为了保证这个计划的实现和提前实现，目前要立即组织全省人民群众掀起轰轰烈烈的技术革命和文化革命，进一步发动广大群众破除迷信，解放思想，从劳动人民中培养出一支强大的又红又专的科学技术队伍和文化队伍。在江西省具体情况下，他说，目前进行技术革命，应着重于领导和组织群众性的工具改良和技术革新运动，对于群众性的创造和发明，只要有利于生产，不论大小，都应该予以重视和鼓励。
    代表们对邵式平的政府工作报告及其他报告进行了热烈的讨论。他们用大量的事实和在大跃进中的体会来说明，只要有了革命的干劲和力争上游的决心，天大的困难都是可以克服的。例如在县县办工业、地方工业遍地开花的口号下，吉安市三天内就办了七十多个工厂；景德镇市郊区大量挖掘潜力之后，只用了一万元就办了二十五个工厂。峡江县没有工程技术人员，就找土专家、土工程师，现做现学，有的人回去后两天就建成了一个小高炉，现在全县已有十几个高炉投入生产。在农业方面，已经出现许多早稻高产的奇迹，有的县仅早稻一季的平均亩产量就可以达到一千斤。代表们一致表示，今后要更高地举起社会主义建设总路线的红旗奋勇前进。
    会议经过充分讨论后，通过了关于省人民委员会的工作报告、发展国民经济的第二个五年计划、1958年的国民经济计划、财政预决算、省高级人民法院工作报告等六项决议。
    会议撤销右派分子罗隆基全国人民代表大会代表资格。
    会议以无记名投票方式选举邵式平为江西省省长，方志纯、黄先、李杰庸、王卓超、汪东兴、饶思诚、邓洪、彭梦庾、欧阳武为江西省副省长，白栋材、刘俊秀、刘建华、刘之纲、危秀英、邵式平、李友秀、吴有训、吴学周、陈劭先、陈翊科、易瑞生、马廷士、郭清四、郭庆棻、许德珩、黄家驷、张诗英、程孝刚、杨惟义、潘振亚为江西省出席第二届全国人民代表大会代表。会议还选举了黄知真等四十一人为江西省人民委员会委员。
