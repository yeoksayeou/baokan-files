Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 13th: The medium-sized and small-scale water conservancy projects built in Henan Province last winter and this spring have played a significant role in overcoming the first flood since the flood season. The Provincial People's Committee issued a public announcement in this regard on the 12th.

The announcement said: From June 27th to July 7th, heavy rains fell successively in various parts of Henan Province. There were eight counties with rainfall of 300 to 400 millimeters, thirty-three counties and cities with rainfall of 200 to 300 millimeters, seventy-seven counties and cities with rainfall of about 100 millimeters, and four counties with rainfall of about 50 millimeters. Extraordinarily heavy rainstorms of 450 to 550 millimeters occurred in the southern part of Xiayi in eastern Henan and the northern part of Xixia in western Henan.

The characteristics of this heavy rain were: wide rain area, large rainfall, strong rain intensity, and rapid movement of the rainstorm center. Due to the great role played by water conservancy projects, the floods were controlled, and no floods occurred. According to preliminary statistics, the rainfall in the province was 20.448 billion cubic meters, infiltration loss was 11.88 billion cubic meters, accounting for 58.1%; various water conservancy projects intercepted and stored 6.798 billion cubic meters, accounting for 33.3%, of which 4.33 billion cubic meters could be used for irrigation, accounting for more than 21%, and could irrigate more than 100 million mu of crops; only 1.77 billion cubic meters were discharged through river channels, accounting for 8.6%.

The announcement said: Due to the medium-sized and small-scale water conservancy projects intercepting and storing a large amount of floodwater, the river flow has changed significantly compared with previous years. According to rainfall conditions in the upper reaches of the Shahe River, calculated based on the runoff relationship in previous years, the flood flow at the Huzhuang Station in Yexian County of the Shahe River should have been 1,200 cubic meters per second, but the actual measured flow this year was 548 cubic meters per second, reducing the peak flood flow by 53%; the peak flood flow at the Ziluoshan Station of the Beiru River should have been 1,000 cubic meters per second, while the actual measured flow was 250 cubic meters per second, reducing the peak flood flow by 75%. In Jiaxian County, a hilly area, the rainfall this time was more than 200 millimeters, and the 631 medium-sized and small-scale reservoirs in the county stored 82 million cubic meters of water, only utilizing 58% of the reservoirs' water storage capacity. In the Malan Township of Yanling County, a plain area, the rainfall this time was 314.9 millimeters. Of the 589 pits and ponds in the township, 582 were filled with water, seven pits and ponds were half-filled, and two reservoirs had not yet stored water. There were no floods in the township; however, when there was rainfall of 165 millimeters last year, 22,000 mu were flooded. In Yongcheng County, which has suffered from floods for many years, the rainfall this time was 300 to 400 millimeters, and no disaster occurred. According to past rainfall and disaster conditions, such heavy rain would likely cause more than 6.7 million mu of flood and waterlogging disasters in the province, but this year there have been basically no floods in various places. This fully proves that the achievements of water conservancy construction in the province are great, and the natural landscape has begun to undergo significant changes.

The announcement finally called on the people of the province to maintain high vigilance, be ready to overcome potentially greater floods at any time, and ensure a bumper autumn harvest in the province.

### 降雨大　蓄水多　没成灾  河南水利工程经受了考验

    降雨大　蓄水多　没成灾
    河南水利工程经受了考验
    据新华社郑州13日电　河南省去冬今春兴建的中、小型水利工程发挥巨大作用，战胜汛期以来第一次洪水。省人民委员会12日发布了这方面的公报。
    公报说：河南省自6月27日至7月7日，全省各地先后普降大雨。降雨量三百至四百公厘的有八个县，二百至三百公厘的有三十三个县、市，一百公厘左右的有七十七个县、市，五十公厘左右的有四个县。豫东夏邑南部和豫西西峡北部出现四百五十至五百五十公厘特大暴雨。
    这次大雨的特点是：雨区广，雨量大，雨势猛，暴雨中心移动快。由于发挥了水利工程的巨大作用，控制了洪水，没有出现水灾。据初步统计，全省降雨量为二百零四点四八亿公方，渗透损耗一百一十八点八亿公方，占58.1％；各项水利工程拦蓄六十七点九八亿公方，占33.3％，其中可用于灌溉的四十三点三亿公方，占21％多，可灌溉作物一亿多亩次；通过河道排泄的仅有十七点七亿公方，占8.6％。
    公报说：由于中、小型水利工程拦蓄了大量洪水，河道流量与往年比较发生了显著变化。沙河上游根据降雨情况，以往年径流关系计算，沙河叶县胡庄站应该产生一千二百秒公方的洪水流量，但今年实测流量五百四十八秒公方，削减洪峰流量53％；北汝河紫罗山站应该出现洪峰流量一千秒公方，而实测流量为二百五十秒公方，削减洪峰流量75％。丘陵地区的郏县，这次降雨二百多公厘，全县六百三十一座中、小型水库蓄水八千二百万公方，仅发挥水库蓄水能力的58％。平原地区的鄢陵县马拦乡这次降雨三百一十四点九公厘，全乡五百八十九个坑塘，有五百八十二个蓄满水，七个坑塘蓄了一半水，两个水库尚未蓄水，全乡没有水灾；而去年一次降雨一百六十五公厘时，却积水成灾二万二千亩。历年涝灾严重的永城县，这次降雨三百至四百公厘，未发生灾害。根据往年雨情和灾情推算，下这样大雨，全省可能发生六百七十余万亩洪涝灾害，而今年各地基本上没有发生水灾。这充分证明全省水利建设的成绩是伟大的，自然面貌已经开始起着显著变化。
    公报最后号召全省人民必须保持高度警惕，随时准备战胜可能到来的更大洪水，保证全省秋季大丰收。
