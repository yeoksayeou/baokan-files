    Hearing Aid Pre-Orders Begin
    Recently, we have received more than 150 letters from readers requesting to purchase the semiconductor hearing aids successfully trial-produced by the Beijing Physical Therapy Equipment Factory. It is understood that due to the insufficient supply of raw materials, mass production is temporarily impossible, and the price has not yet been determined. The factory is now actively seeking ways to expedite mass production. Those who wish to buy can write to them to register for pre-orders, without paying in advance. The address is No. 6 Langjiayuan, Jianguomenwai, Beijing.

    耳聋助听器开始预购
    最近我们收到一百五十多个读者来信，要购买北京理疗器械厂试制成功的半导体耳聋助听器。据了解，目前因为原材料供应不足，暂时不能大量投入生产，售价也未确定。现在这个厂正积极设法争取早日大批生产，要买的可以给他们写信登记预购，不必先付货款。地址在北京建国门外郎家园六号。　　编者
