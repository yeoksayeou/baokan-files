Under the current situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, new changes have taken place in vegetable production and supply throughout the country. As large-scale capital construction and water conservancy construction are underway in various places, the population of towns, newly built industrial and mining areas, and water conservancy construction sites has rapidly concentrated. Vegetable production in these areas cannot meet the needs for the time being, and therefore the vegetable supply in these areas has been insufficient.

With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, new construction sites continue to increase. It is estimated that the number of people participating in the construction of new construction sites this winter and next spring will increase even more. If calculated according to the supply of six taels of pickles and one catty of fresh vegetables per person per day, at least 4.5 billion catties of pickles and 12 billion catties of fresh vegetables will be needed in five months. At the same time, with the rapid development of industry and the increase of the urban population, the demand for urban vegetables will also increase. Producing and supplying such a large amount of vegetables is a very arduous task. Whether this work is done well or not is not only related to whether the people's daily necessities can be guaranteed, but also to the smooth progress of national economic construction. Therefore, Party committees and people's committees at all levels must pay full attention to vegetable production and supply and strengthen leadership over this work.

In order to do a good job in vegetable production and supply in the future, the CCP Central Committee and the State Council hereby issue the following instructions:

I. The fundamental way to solve the tight vegetable supply is to quickly and actively organize vegetable production. All localities should earnestly do a good job in vegetable production and marketing planning to ensure the timely sowing of autumn vegetables. Except for areas with external transfer tasks, all localities should plan the vegetable planting area according to the actual needs of the local area. In order to prevent possible natural disasters, all localities should increase a certain "safety factor" when planning the vegetable planting area; areas with conditions should also establish vegetable production bases in a planned way to ensure on-site production and on-site supply. In short, it is necessary to achieve: where there is a construction site, there are vegetables to eat. At present, the sowing time for autumn vegetables has arrived. As the saying goes in the north, "Radishes are planted in the first Fu, vegetables in the second Fu", all localities must seize the opportunity to do a good job in sowing autumn vegetables. In order to ensure the timely sowing of autumn vegetables, all localities should guide agricultural production cooperatives to make overall arrangements for labor and help them solve problems in vegetable seeds and production technology. Especially in the northern regions, the autumn vegetable sowing season is earlier. In order not to miss the farming season, methods of planning and production can also be adopted simultaneously.

II. Properly arrange the problem of farmers eating vegetables. Since the great leap forward in agricultural production, the amount of labor required in collective production has greatly increased, and the time for agricultural production cooperative members to carry out vegetable production on private plots has decreased. In order to ensure the farmers' own vegetable needs, agricultural production cooperatives should make proper arrangements. When necessary, professional production teams (groups) can be established to specialize in or mainly plant vegetables.

III. Mobilize and organize the masses to process a large number of dried vegetables and pickles. Dried vegetables and pickles are easy to preserve and carry, and people generally have the habit of eating them. Therefore, all localities should seize the peak season of vegetable production, mobilize and organize urban and rural residents and collective food units such as organs, groups, schools, troops, and factories and mines to dry a large number of vegetables and marinate pickles and pickles. Vegetable business departments must also organize their own processing enterprises and pickle gardens to process, marinate, and store a large number of dried vegetables and pickles to regulate the off-season and support the needs of construction sites.

IV. Business departments must take all measures to support vegetable production; at the same time, they must do a good job in vegetable storage and transportation, improve business management, improve supply methods, and do a good job in regional adjustment.

Please study and implement the above points immediately. July 17, 1958

    中共中央、国务院关于加强蔬菜生产和供应
    工作的领导，适时地做好秋菜播种工作的指示
    在当前工农业生产大跃进的形势下，蔬菜的生产和供应工作在全国范围内发生了新的变化。由于各地正在进行大规模的基本建设和水利建设，城镇、新建工矿区和水利建设工地的人口迅速地集中起来，这些地区的蔬菜生产一时还不能满足需要，因而这些地区的蔬菜供应曾经出现了供应不足的情况。
    随着工农业生产大跃进，新的建设工地仍在继续增加。预计今冬明春参加新工地建设的人数将有更大的增加。如按每人每天供应六两咸菜、一斤鲜菜计算，五个月就至少需要供应咸菜四十五亿斤、鲜菜一百二十亿斤。同时，随着工业的迅速发展和城市人口的增加，城市蔬菜的需要量也将更加增多。生产和供应如此大量的蔬菜，是一件十分艰巨的任务。这一工作做得好坏，不仅关系到人民日常生活必需品能否得到保证，而且关系到国家经济建设的顺利进行。因此，各级党委和人民委员会对蔬菜的生产和供应工作必须予以充分的重视，加强对这一工作的领导。
    为了作好今后的蔬菜生产工作和供应工作，中共中央和国务院特作如下指示：
    一、解决蔬菜供应紧张的根本方法是迅速地积极地组织蔬菜生产。各地应该切实做好蔬菜的产销规划，保证秋菜的适时播种。除了有外调任务的地区以外，各地都应当根据当地的实际需要，规划蔬菜播种面积。为了防止可能发生的自然灾害，各地在规划蔬菜播种面积的时候，应当增加一定的“安全系数”；有条件的地区还应当有计划地建立蔬菜生产基地，以保证做到就地生产、就地供应。总之要做到：那里有工地，那里有菜吃。目前秋菜播种时间已经到来，北方俗话说：“头伏萝卜二伏菜”，“冬春吃菜靠一秋”，各地必须抓紧时机，作好秋菜播种工作。为了保证秋菜适时播种，各地应该指导农业生产合作社统盘安排劳动力，并且帮助他们解决蔬菜种籽和生产技术等方面的问题。特别是北方地区，秋菜播种季节较早，为了不失农时，还可以采取边规划边生产的办法。
    二、妥善地安排农民吃菜问题。农业生产大跃进以来，由于集体生产中的劳动力需要量大大增加，农业生产合作社社员在自留地上进行蔬菜生产的时间减少了。为了保证农民自己的蔬菜需要，农业生产合作社应当作妥善的安排，必要的时候，可以成立专业的生产队（组），专门或者以主要力量种植蔬菜。
    三、发动和组织群众大量加工干菜和咸菜。干菜和咸菜既容易保存，又便于携带，人民普遍有食用习惯。因此，各地应当抓紧蔬菜生产旺季，发动和组织城乡居民和机关、团体、学校、部队、厂矿企业等集体伙食单位，大量晒干菜和腌制酱咸菜。蔬菜经营部门也必须组织自己的加工企业和酱菜园，大量加工腌制和储备干菜、咸菜，以调剂淡旺季和支援建设工地的需要。
    四、业务经营部门必须采取一切措施，支持蔬菜生产；同时必须作好蔬菜储藏调运工作，改善经营管理，改进供应方法，做好地区之间的调剂。
    以上各点，请即研究执行。  1958年7月17日（附图片）
