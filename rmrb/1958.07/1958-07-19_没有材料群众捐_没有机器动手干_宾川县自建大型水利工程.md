Without Materials, the Masses Donate; Without Machines, They Work with Their Hands
Binchuan County Self-Constructs Large-Scale Water Conservancy Project

(Our dispatch) The masses in Binchuan County, Yunnan Province, have broken superstitions and are independently constructing large-scale water conservancy projects capable of irrigating over 200,000 mu of farmland. Currently, the county consistently has over 20,000 laborers working on the construction sites. The Haishao Reservoir, with a dam height of 28 meters and capable of irrigating 160,000 mu, has completed the majority of its earthwork. The Huqiao Reservoir, with a dam height of 42 meters and capable of irrigating 100,000 mu, has completed one-third of its engineering work. Both projects are being constructed and storing water simultaneously.

The irrigation project to divert water from Erhai Lake, planned to include a total of 120 kilometers of tunnels and canals, is underway with drilling and shaft sinking and is expected to be completed by May of next year. After the completion of these projects, Binchuan's irrigated area can be expanded to 500,000 mu, which is three and a half times that of last year and ten times that of before liberation.

Binchuan County is a major cotton-producing area in Yunnan, with excellent soil. However, due to water scarcity, it suffers from varying degrees of drought every year, resulting in extremely low cotton yields, averaging only a little over 10 jin (lint) per mu before liberation. In recent years, although many small-scale water conservancy projects have been built, improving irrigation, the threat of drought has not been eliminated. In 1956, a record yield of 61 jin of cotton per mu was achieved. Due to drought, the yield dropped to 30 jin per mu in 1957. In order to strive for the goal of achieving 100 jin of cotton per mu and doubling grain production in one year, the people of the county have independently started constructing large-scale reservoirs.

The lack of modern technical equipment is a contradiction encountered everywhere during construction. The masses actively come up with ways to overcome this difficulty. When pneumatic drills are insufficient, the masses use hand hammers to drill blasting holes and open tunnels. They say: "If machines come, we will learn the technology. If machines don't come, we will use manual labor. We would rather work diligently than sit and wait." A 70-meter-long tunnel was built in this way.

Initially, some people believed that without national investment, large reservoirs could not be built. They estimated that the construction of two large reservoirs would require an investment of over 10 million yuan. However, during construction, the masses contributed a large amount of wood, straw, bricks, and tiles, cut bamboo themselves, built their own sheds, and manufactured their own carts, tools, and homemade explosives. This year, the construction of a total of 499 large, medium, and small projects has only cost over 800,000 yuan.

### 没有材料群众捐　没有机器动手干  宾川县自建大型水利工程

    没有材料群众捐　没有机器动手干
    宾川县自建大型水利工程
    本报讯　云南省宾川县群众打破迷信，自己建设灌溉水田二十万亩以上的大型水利工程。现在该县经常有两万多民工在工地战斗着。坝高二十八公尺，灌溉十六万亩的海哨水库已完成了大部分土方工程；一个坝高四十二公尺，灌溉十万亩的花桥水库也已完成了工程量的三分之一。这两个工程，一面修建，一面都已蓄水。
    计划开凿隧道及渠道共一百二十公里的引洱海水的灌溉工程已进行打洞、挖竖井，预计到明年5月结束。完成这几项工程以后，宾川的灌溉面积可以扩大到五十万亩，等于去年的三倍半，等于解放前的十倍。
    宾川县是云南的主要产棉区，土质很好，因为缺水，每年都有程度不同的旱灾，棉花产量极低，解放前平均每亩只有十多斤（皮棉）。近几年来，虽修了不少小型水利，使灌溉情况有所改善，但仍不能免除干旱的威胁，1956年出现亩产棉花六十一斤的空前纪录；因为天旱，1957年又降为亩产三十斤。为争取一年实现棉花亩产一百斤，粮食翻一番的目标，全县人民就自己动手干起大型水库来了。
    缺乏现代化的技术设备是在修建中处处遇到的矛盾。群众积极想办法克服这个困难。风钻不够，群众就用手锤打炮眼，开隧道。他们说：“机器来了学技术，机器不来用手工，宁肯勤动手，决不坐着等。”一个七十公尺长的隧道就是这样干出来的。
    开初有人曾认为国家不投资，就修不起大水库，据他们估算，修建两个大水库需投资一千万元以上。但在修建中，群众拿出大量木材、稻草、砖瓦，自砍竹子，自盖工棚，自造车子、工具及土炸药，今年修建大、中、小型共四百九十九件工程总共只花了八十多万元。
