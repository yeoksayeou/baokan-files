Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 5th. The Office of the Central Committee's Nine-Person Leading Group for Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control held a National Schistosomiasis Treatment Work Conference in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, from June 27th to July 3rd. More than 100 people attended the meeting, including heads of schistosomiasis prevention and control offices from the Party committees of twelve provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, including Zhejiang, Hunan, Anhui, Hubei, Guangdong, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, Jiangsu, Guangxi, and Shanghai, as well as advanced medical workers and relevant experts.

The conference exchanged experiences in schistosomiasis treatment work from various regions, criticized the conservative and superstitious thinking in past treatment work, studied and affirmed the short-course therapy, nighttime therapy, and outpatient therapy created by grassroots medical personnel, which are convenient for the people and adapt to production. It encouraged medical personnel in various regions to continue to innovate boldly and carry out treatment work with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, thereby greatly enhancing the confidence of various regions in eliminating schistosomiasis ahead of schedule.

According to the reflections of the attending representatives, the treatment work in the first half of this year has generally shown an unprecedented leap forward in various regions. Representatives from Hunan Province introduced the advanced deeds of their medical personnel in smashing superstition, innovating technology, and improving work efficiency. For example, Huang Weiheng, a medical officer from the Matang Prevention and Treatment Group in Yueyang County, created a complete set of simple and economical medical instruments through bold thinking and painstaking research, which increased the safety of disinfection and improved work efficiency by 20 to 25 times, and drug extraction by five to six times, achieving sterile operation. The number of people treated per month increased from more than 30 in the past to 700. Another example is Liu Jintao and other three medical officers from the Pioneer Treatment Group of the Hunan Institute of Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control, who, with the support of the Party committee, boldly broke with convention and summarized "Twenty Innovations in Antimony Agent Treatment Technology" based on practical experience. In nineteen working days, they treated 2,447 patients, increasing work efficiency by more than ten times compared to the past. Representatives from Zhejiang Province introduced the significant innovations of their medical personnel in treatment methods. For example, Shen Songnian, a physician from Jiashan County, first boldly created nighttime therapy, and then developed it into side-labor, side-injection, and door-to-door injection, which solved the contradiction between production and treatment and was welcomed by the majority of cadres and the masses. The medical personnel in this county also boldly shortened the course of treatment and successfully experimented with two-day therapy. Representatives from other provinces and cities also introduced their treatment work experience at the meeting.

While introducing their experiences, representatives from various regions unanimously believed that smashing superstition and innovating technology are the fundamental ways to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results in treatment work. Many medical workers spoke at the meeting, expressing that only under the leadership of the Party, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, and putting politics in command, can they serve the people well.

The advanced experiences and inventions of various provinces have attracted great attention from the attendees. The representatives also used their rest time to exchange experiences individually and learn advanced treatment methods.

This conference changed the usual treatment conference routine of experts reporting and young medical personnel listening quietly. The speakers at the conference who introduced their experiences were all young medical personnel. The experts were inspired and educated by this conference. Qian Hui, Vice President of Chongqing Medical College, said: "The medical experience of these young comrades does not seem to have any profound theory, but it has solved great problems in practical work. Things that we experts did not dare to think about in the past have now been done by young comrades." He expressed his determination to learn from the youth, fight against conservative ideas, work hard, and strive for the top.

During the conference, the representatives also visited and studied in Puzhuang Township in Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province, and Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, which are advanced areas in eliminating schistosomiasis.

During the conference, seven counties and cities in Jiangsu Province, including Zhenze, Baoying, Jinshan, Jiangyin, Taixian, Liuhe, and Yangzhou, and Qianshan County in Anhui Province, successively reported good news to the conference: these counties and cities have basically eliminated schistosomiasis. The representatives expressed that they are fully confident in striving for a comprehensive victory in eliminating schistosomiasis in the short term.

    新华社南京5日电　中共中央血吸虫病防治九人小组办公室从6月27日至7月3日在江苏省苏州市召开全国血吸虫病治疗工作会议。参加会议的有浙江、湖南、安徽、湖北、广东、四川、江西、福建、云南、江苏、广西、上海等十二个省、市、自治区的党委血吸虫病防治办公室负责人、先进医务工作者和有关专家共一百余人。
    这次会议交流了各地血吸虫病治疗工作的经验，批判了过去治疗工作中的保守、迷信思想，研究和肯定了基层医务人员大胆创造的利民、便民、适应生产的短程疗法、夜间疗法和门诊疗法，鼓励了各地医务人员继续大胆革新，多快好省地开展治疗工作，从而大大增强了各地提前消灭血吸虫病的信心。
    根据到会代表的反映：今年上半年的治疗工作，各地普遍出现了空前跃进的局面。湖南省代表介绍他们医务人员破除迷信、革新技术、提高工作效率的先进事迹。如岳阳县麻塘防治组医士黄维恒，由于大胆设想、苦心钻研，创造了十种简便、经济的整套医疗器具，使安全消毒提高工作效率二十到二十五倍，抽药提高五、六倍，并达到无菌操作，每月治疗人数由过去三十多人增加到七百人。又如湖南血吸虫病防治研究所先锋治疗组医士刘锦桃等三人，在党委支持下，大胆打破常规，根据实际经验总结出“锑剂治疗技术革新二十条”，在十九个工作日中，就治疗了病人二千四百四十七人，比过去的工作效率提高十多倍。浙江省代表介绍了他们医务人员在治疗方法方面的重大创造。如嘉善县医师沈松年首先大胆创造夜间疗法，继而发展到边劳动、边打针和上门打针，解决了生产与治疗的矛盾，受到广大干部和群众的欢迎。这个县的医务人员还大胆缩短疗程，试行二日疗法成功。其他省市代表也都在会上介绍了他们的治疗工作经验。
    各地代表在介绍经验的同时，一致认为破除迷信、革新技术是治疗工作实现多快好省的根本途径。许多医务工作者在会上发言，表示只有在党的领导下，兴无灭资，政治挂帅，才能为人民服务得好。
    各省的先进经验和创造发明，都受到到会者的极大注意，代表们还利用休息时间，个别交流经验，学习先进治疗方法。
    这次会议一改往日专家报告，年青医务人员静听的治疗会议常规，在会上发言介绍经验的都是青年医护人员。专家们通过这次会议受到启发和教育。重庆医学院副院长钱惠说：“这些青年同志的医疗经验看来没有什么高深理论，却解决了实际工作中很大的问题。过去我们专家想都不敢想的事，现在都被青年同志做到了。”他表示决心向青年学习，和保守思想作斗争，鼓足干劲，力争上游。
    会议期间，代表们还在消灭血吸虫病先进地区——江苏省震泽县浦庄乡和浙江省嘉善县，进行了参观学习。
    会议期间，江苏省震泽、宝应、金山、江阴、泰县、六合、扬州等七个县市和安徽省潜山县先后向大会报喜：这些县市已基本消灭了血吸虫病。代表们表示完全有信心争取短期内取得消灭血吸虫病的全面胜利。
