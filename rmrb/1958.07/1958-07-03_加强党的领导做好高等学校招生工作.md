Strengthen Party Leadership and Do a Good Job in College Enrollment

College enrollment is the first step in cultivating both red and expert talent for various construction endeavors. All regions and schools should attach importance to and do a good job in this work. In the past few years, although there have been gradual improvements in college enrollment work in terms of completing the state enrollment plan and gradually improving the quality of new students, there are still serious shortcomings. These shortcomings were exposed very clearly during the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle. The main shortcomings in the past were: in the enrollment work, the enrollment agencies at all levels and colleges and universities did not closely rely on the leadership of the Party, politics was not put in command, and there was a serious tendency to deviate from politics. Instead of taking political quality as the primary condition and selecting the best new students by combining political conditions and academic performance, they simply admitted students in order of their scores on academic exams. The direction of the political courses was also unclear, divorced from real struggles, and lacked strong ideological content, which indeed encouraged young people to bury themselves in books. All of these are wrong. This year's enrollment work must pay attention to overcoming these shortcomings.

Putting politics in command and Party committee leadership are the fundamental issues in doing a good job in college enrollment. Local enrollment agencies and colleges and universities must, under the leadership of the local Party committees and school Party committees, do a good job in the political review, health check, examination work, and admission work for candidates. Enrollment exams should primarily emphasize political quality (referring to the candidate's usual political and ideological character), but also test cultural proficiency. The political exam questions should have a clear political direction, not asking people to recite, but guiding young people to pay attention to participating in real struggles through exams. In short, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the Party's policies and principles and admit new students.

College enrollment should also pay attention to implementing the class line. At present, the proportion of students from worker and peasant backgrounds in colleges and universities accounts for only about one-third of the total number of students. This is incompatible with the nature of a socialist country and the fact that workers and peasants account for more than 80% of the country's population. This unreasonable situation must be gradually changed. In order to increase the proportion of students from worker and peasant backgrounds in colleges and universities and improve the political quality of new students, the Ministry of Education has stipulated that workers, peasants, graduates of worker-peasant rapid courses, worker-peasant cadres, and veteran cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for a long time, who have good political and professional qualifications, should be admitted without examination or given priority admission. This regulation is necessary and reasonable. It must be pointed out that worker and peasant students or worker and peasant cadres may be slightly inferior to young students in terms of book knowledge, which is caused by historical conditions. However, their knowledge of class struggle and production struggle is undoubtedly much higher than that of ordinary students. Admitting a group of worker and peasant students and worker and peasant cadres without examination and giving them priority admission will not only not reduce the quality of new college students, but will also improve the quality of new students. Those bourgeois viewpoints that despise working people and discriminate against worker and peasant students are wrong and should be criticized. However, it should also be pointed out that emphasizing the priority admission of worker and peasant students does not mean that their admission qualifications are not examined at all. The worker and peasant students admitted must meet the prescribed standards for political and health conditions, and their academic conditions are also required to be at a level that allows them to keep up with classes.

In the past few years, colleges and universities have adopted the method of national unified enrollment, which has been beneficial to ensuring the comprehensive completion of enrollment tasks and ensuring the quality of new students. However, due to excessive uniformity and over-concentration, it has affected the full play of the enthusiasm and initiative of local governments and colleges and universities. Especially in the current situation of improving the leadership system, decentralizing central power, and making a great leap forward in socialist construction, the national unified enrollment method can no longer meet the requirements of the new situation. In order to facilitate the strengthening of the leadership of local Party committees over college enrollment work, better implement the principle of adapting to local conditions and adapting to school conditions, and give full play to the enthusiasm of local governments and colleges and universities in running schools, it has been decided this year to change the unified enrollment system and implement the method of independent or joint enrollment by schools. Implementing independent or joint enrollment by schools still requires absorbing the basic experience of past unified enrollment. Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should still establish enrollment agencies, which, under the leadership of the local Party committees and people's committees, will uniformly organize and lead the enrollment work of local colleges and universities, and should set up examination areas widely to facilitate candidates' applications.

In order to actively realize the Party's general line for socialist construction and meet the needs of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and other undertakings in our country in the future, the national colleges and universities plan to enroll 148,000 students this year. In addition to this plan, central departments and various regions will also increase the enrollment of a certain number of new students. However, the source of students is not very sufficient, and there is a large imbalance in the regional distribution of students and the enrollment tasks of colleges and universities in various regions. In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of the national enrollment plan (both ensuring quantity and ensuring quality), it is completely necessary to take appropriate measures and make overall arrangements. All localities should actively expand the source of students, mobilize high school graduates and graduates of worker-peasant rapid courses to actively apply for colleges and universities, and not divert them to other uses; after completing the enrollment tasks, students who are not admitted will be arranged by the local governments for other purposes. Regarding the regional scope of enrollment for various types of colleges and universities and the number of students enrolled in various regions, the Ministry of Education has consulted with provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and schools to formulate a transfer plan based on the nature and tasks of the schools. All localities and colleges and universities should give full play to the communist spirit of mutual cooperation and mutual support, and carry out enrollment work according to the transfer plan. When admitting new students, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should first ensure the enrollment of colleges and universities directly under the central ministries, second, ensure the enrollment of major colleges and universities in other provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions) that have been determined through agreements in their own provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions); third, ensure the enrollment of important colleges and universities in their own provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions); and then, as far as possible, meet the enrollment needs of other colleges and universities in their own provinces and other needs in their own provinces. In order to better ensure the completion of this year's college enrollment tasks, all regions should conscientiously do a good job in ideological education for candidates, and comprehensively and realistically introduce the professional situation of colleges and universities to candidates, so that candidates can choose their application preferences realistically based on a comprehensive understanding of national needs and in combination with their specific conditions.

Currently, there are only three weeks left before the enrollment exam. Time is very tight. Local education administrative departments, enrollment agencies at all levels, and colleges and universities should, under the leadership of the local Party committees and people's committees, quickly carry out enrollment work in accordance with the "Regulations on the Enrollment of New Students in Colleges and Universities in 1958" issued by the Ministry of Education today, and strive to comprehensively complete this year's enrollment tasks.

### 加强党的领导做好高等学校招生工作

    加强党的领导做好高等学校招生工作
    高等学校招生，是培养又红又专的各项专门建设人材的第一步工作。各地区、各学校都应该重视和做好这项工作。过去几年，高等学校的招生工作，在完成国家招生计划和逐步提高新生的质量方面，虽然逐年有所改进，但仍然存在着严重的缺点。这些缺点，在整风运动和反右派斗争中，暴露的十分明显。过去的主要缺点是：在招生工作中，各级招生机构和高等学校，没有紧密依靠党的领导，政治没有挂帅，有严重脱离政治的错误倾向。不是以政治质量为首要条件，结合政治条件和学业成绩择优录取新生，而是单纯按照学科考试成绩高低依次录取。政治课考试的方向也不明确，脱离了现实斗争，思想性不强，确有鼓励青年死啃书本的现象。这些都是错误的。今年的招生工作，必须注意克服这些缺点。
    政治挂帅，党委领导，是做好高等学校招生工作的根本问题。各地招生机构和高等学校必须在当地党委和学校党委的领导下，做好对考生的政治审查工作、健康检查工作、考试工作和录取工作。招生考试，主要应重视政治质量（指考生平时的政治思想品质），同时也考文化程度。政治课的考题，应该有明确的政治方向，不是叫人去背书，而是通过考试，引导青年注意参加现实的斗争。总之，要认真贯彻党的方针政策，录取新生。
    高等学校招生，还要注意贯彻阶级路线。目前，高等学校在校学生中的工农成份学生的比重，只占在校学生总人数的三分之一左右。这和社会主义国家的性质以及我国工农群众在全国人口中占80％以上的情况是不相适应的。这种不合理的状况，必须逐步地加以改变。为了增加高等学校中工农成份学生的比重，提高新生的政治质量，教育部规定了对于政治、业务条件都好的工人、农民、工农速成中学毕业生、工农干部和参加革命工作时间较久的老干部等，采取免试保送入学和优先录取的办法。这个规定是必要的、合理的。必须提出：工农学生或工农干部，在书本知识方面，可能比青年学生稍差一些，这是历史条件所造成的。但是他们的阶级斗争知识和生产斗争知识，无疑的比一般学生要高的多。免试保送和优先录取一批工农学生、工农干部等，不仅不会降低高等学校新生的质量，还将会提高新生质量。那些轻视劳动人民，歧视工农学生的资产阶级观点是错误的，应该进行批判。但是也应当提出，强调优先吸收工农学生入学，并不是完全不考查他们的入学条件。被吸收入学的工农学生，政治、健康条件都必须合乎规定的标准，学业条件也要求能达到跟班上课的水平。
    以往几年，高等学校是采取全国统一招生的办法，这对保证全面完成招生任务和保证新生质量方面，有一定的好处。但是由于统的过多和过分集中，就影响了地方和高等学校充分发挥积极性和主动性。特别是在目前改进领导体制、中央权力下放和社会主义建设大跃进的情况下，全国统一招生的办法，已经不能适应新形势的要求。为了便于加强地方党委对高等学校招生工作的领导，更好地贯彻因地制宜、因校制宜的原则，充分发挥地方和高等学校办学的积极性，今年决定改变统一招生制度，实行学校单独或者联合招生的办法。实行学校单独或者联合招生，仍须吸收过去统一招生的基本经验。各省、市、自治区仍要建立招生机构，在当地党委和人民委员会的领导下，统一地组织领导当地高等学校的招生工作，并且要广设考区，便利考生报考。
    为了积极实现党的社会主义建设的总路线，适应今后我国工农业生产和其他事业大跃进的需要，今年全国高等学校计划招生十四万八千人。在这个计划以外，中央各部门和各地区还将增加招收一定数量的新生。但是学生来源却不甚充足，学生的地区分布和各地区高等学校招生任务也有较大的不平衡。为了保证国家招生计划的全面完成（既要保证数量，也要保证质量），采取适当措施，进行统筹安排是完全必要的。各地应该积极扩大学生来源，动员高中毕业生和工农速成中学毕业生踊跃报考高等学校，不抽作他用；在完成招生任务以后，未录取的学生，再由地方作其他安排。对于各类高等学校招生的地区范围，和在各地招生的人数，教育部根据学校的性质和任务，已与各省、市、自治区、各学校协商拟订了调剂方案。各地、各高等学校要充分发挥共同协作，相互支援的共产主义精神，根据调剂方案进行招生工作。各省、市、自治区在录取新生的时候，首先应当保证中央各部直接管辖的高等学校的招生，其次保证经过协议确定的外省（市、自治区）主要高等学校在本省（市、自治区）的招生；第三，保证本省（市、自治区）重要高等学校的招生；然后，尽可能满足本省其他高等学校的招生，和本省其他方面的需要。为了保证更好地完成今年高等学校的招生任务，各地区应该认真做好对考生的升学思想教育工作，要全面地、实事求是地向考生介绍高等学校的专业情况，使考生在全面了解国家需要的基础上，结合个人的具体条件，实事求是地选择升学志愿。
    目前，离招生考试时间只有三个星期了。时间已很紧迫，各地教育行政部门、各级招生机构和高等学校，应该在当地党委和人民委员会的领导下，按照教育部今天发布的“关于高等学校1958年招考新生的规定”，迅速开展招生工作，争取全面完成今年的招生任务。
