Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd dispatch from Washington: The United States and Britain, during lengthy talks held in Washington from the 17th to the 20th specifically on the Middle East situation, plotted further conspiracies to expand interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd already left for home via New York on the same day the talks concluded.

During these four days of talks, the US side was represented by President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, CIA Director Allen Dulles, Defense Secretary McElroy, chief State Department Middle East expert William Rountree, and Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Burke Elbrick, among others. The British side was represented by Lloyd and Michael Denny, head of the British Joint Services Mission in Washington.

Reports from Western news agencies indicate that representatives of the ruling groups of both countries decided during the talks not only to occupy Lebanon and Jordan for the long term, refusing to immediately withdraw their aggressive troops from these two countries, but also to turn their aggression against Lebanon and Jordan into a fait accompli and "legitimize" it, and after consolidating their aggressive positions in these two countries, to further launch aggression against other Middle Eastern countries, particularly the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic.

An editorial in the "New York Times" on the 18th revealed the ambition of the United States and Britain to collude in expanding aggression. The newspaper said, "Since the Americans believe that this (referring to armed intervention in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries) is deeply related to their own vital interests, they must now also realize that Britain's interests are even greater by comparison." The newspaper said, "The stakes involved are even greater than the Suez Canal, and this time Britain is defending interests that are greatly related to whether it can continue to exist as a major power..." Therefore, "it is right to carry out the necessary work by showing as much strength as possible." This statement by the "New York Times" renders all the excuses spread by the United States and Britain when launching this aggression worthless.

One of their political conspiracies is to put the flag of the United Nations on their aggressive troops in the Middle East, making the United Nations their tool of aggression as in the Korean War, in order to brazenly launch a war of aggression. News indicates that the issue of sending so-called United Nations Emergency Forces to the Middle East was discussed during the talks between Dulles and Lloyd. To this end, Lloyd held talks with the President of the current United Nations General Assembly, New Zealand Ambassador to the United States Munro, during his stay in Washington, and held two hours of talks with United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld in New York.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Beirut: The United States continues to send troops to occupy Lebanon and is engaging in atomic war intimidation.

A spokesman for the US invading forces declared at a press conference held in Beirut on the 21st that the invading forces' naval, land, and air forces "all have the capability to wage atomic war." He said that the US Marine Corps has eight-inch howitzers that can fire atomic shells up to eleven miles away.

The second batch of 1,400 US invading army troops, which began to be airlifted to Beirut from the Neubiberg Air Force Base in West Germany on the 20th, have now all arrived in Beirut.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Amman: Recently, the United States has been urgently transporting weapons and oil to Jordan to help the Hussein puppet dynasty and the British troops invading Jordan to suppress the Jordanian people and to prepare for further expansion of aggressive activities.

Recently, some American ships unloaded medium tanks and tracked vehicles at the port of Aqaba in Jordan. Activity at this port is very intense.

The US invading forces in Lebanon are also desperately airlifting oil to Amman, the capital of Jordan. According to the US Embassy in Jordan, this airlift will be carried out day and night until oil tankers arrive at Aqaba in Jordan.

Jordan has no oil wells or refineries. According to Western news agencies, even the US-British invading forces' general staff doubt whether the oil supply to Jordan can be resolved by air transport.

### 美英策划扩大侵略  美国增兵黎巴嫩，赶运武器到约旦

    美英策划扩大侵略
    美国增兵黎巴嫩，赶运武器到约旦
    据新华社22日讯  华盛顿消息：美英两国在17日到20日专门就中东局势问题在华盛顿进行的长时期会谈中，策划了进一步扩大干涉中东国家人民内政的阴谋。英国外交大臣劳埃德已经在会谈结束后的当天取道纽约回国。
    在这四天的会谈中，美国方面参加的有总统艾森豪威尔、国务卿杜勒斯、中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯、国防部长麦克耳罗伊、国务院首席中东问题专家威廉·朗特里以及负责欧洲问题的助理国务卿伯克·埃尔布里克等。英国方面参加的有劳埃德、驻华盛顿英国三军联合使团团长迈克尔·丹尼等。
    西方通讯社的报道表明，两国统治集团的代表在会谈中决定不仅要长期侵占黎巴嫩和约旦，拒绝立即从这两个国家撤退它们的侵略军队，而且决定要使它们对黎、约两国的侵略变成既成事实和“合法化”，并且在巩固它们在这两个国家中的侵略阵地之后，进一步发动对中东其他国家、特别是伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国的侵略。
    “纽约时报”18日的社论透露了美英两国互相勾结扩大侵略的野心。这家报纸说，“美国人既然认为这（指武装干涉中东国家人民内政）深切地关系着他们自己的切身利益，因此他们现在也必须认识到，英国的利益比较起来甚至比他们的利益更大。”报纸说，“（这次干涉）所涉及的利害关系甚至比苏伊士运河还要大得多，这一次英国要保卫的是同它是否能够作为一个大国继续存在下去有极大关系的利益……”因此，“用尽量显示力量的方法来进行必须做的工作是正确的。”“纽约时报”的这番话，使得美英两国在发动这次侵略时所散布的一切借口，都变得一钱不值了。
    它们的一个政治阴谋是给它们的在中东的侵略军队安上联合国的旗帜，像在朝鲜战争中那样使联合国变成它们的侵略工具，以便放肆地发动侵略战争。消息表明，在杜勒斯和劳埃德的会谈中，曾经讨论了派遣所谓联合国紧急部队去中东的问题。劳埃德为此在逗留华盛顿期间同本届联合国大会主席、新西兰驻美大使孟罗举行了会谈，并且在纽约同联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德举行了两小时的会谈。
    据新华社讯  贝鲁特消息：美国继续派遣军队侵占黎巴嫩，并且进行原子战争恫吓。
    美国侵略军的发言人21日在贝鲁特举行的记者招待会上叫嚣说，侵略军的海陆空部队“都有进行原子战争的能力”。他说，美国海军陆战队有口径八英寸的榴弹炮，这种大炮能够把原子炮弹发射到十一英里以外去。
    20日从西德的诺伊比贝格空军基地开始空运到贝鲁特的第二批美国侵略军陆军部队一千四百人今天已经全部到达贝鲁特。
    据新华社22日讯  安曼消息：最近美国正在紧张地把武器和石油运到约旦去帮助侯赛因傀儡王朝和侵略约旦的英国军队去镇压约旦人民，并且为进一步扩大侵略活动进行准备。
    最近有一些美国船只在约旦的亚喀巴港卸下了中型坦克和有履带的车辆。这个港口的活动很紧张。
    在黎巴嫩的美国侵略军也在拚命把石油空运到约旦首都安曼，据美国驻约旦大使馆宣布，这项空运工作将要夜以继日地进行，直到油船开到约旦的亚喀巴为止。
    约旦没有石油井和炼油厂。据西方通讯社透露，目前用空运办法能否解决对约旦的石油供应问题，连美英侵略军参谋部也表示怀疑。
