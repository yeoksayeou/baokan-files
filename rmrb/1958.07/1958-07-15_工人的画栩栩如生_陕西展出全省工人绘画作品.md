Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 14th: The Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Xi'an Branch of the Chinese Artists Association recently jointly held the Shaanxi Provincial Workers' Painting Exhibition. This is the first province-wide workers' painting exhibition, featuring more than 300 amateur works by workers, including cartoons, propaganda posters, watercolor paintings, and sketches, selected from the tens of thousands of works by workers since the Great Leap Forward.

These works vividly reflect the rich content of the Great Leap Forward, the advance towards technology and culture, and other aspects. For example, "After an Intense Labor," painted by Wang Dajun, an 18-year-old coal miner from Tongchuan Coal Mine, vividly depicts the joyous mood of the miners resting in the coal mine. In the picture, each miner has a distinct personality, talking and laughing, some holding up water bottles for a hearty drink, and some playing around. "Jiangcheng Fort Under Construction," painted by Zheng Shuhua, a 19-year-old worker from a factory in Baoji, shows a busy scene with vehicles, crowds, and red flags flying, with people operating various machines in intense construction. The composition of the picture is balanced, and the colors are bright. Zhang Changsong, a member of a handicraft cooperative, used traditional painting techniques in his traditional Chinese painting "Study Hard." In the picture, an old worker wearing glasses is teaching a female apprentice as diligently as if he were teaching his own daughter. The female apprentice looks happy and is learning humbly from the master. Li Shouye, a worker from the Yellow River Cotton Textile Factory, satirized those who blindly believe that the path taken by their predecessors is infallible and stick to conventions in his cartoon "Footprints of Predecessors." The picture shows a person cautiously following the path of his predecessors with a bundle of books on his back, not daring to cross the line. In addition, many works such as "Great Leap Forward in State-owned Cotton Factory No. 3" and "Every Household Has a Lamp, the Sound of Reading Can Be Heard Everywhere" are closely integrated with the current reality and profoundly reflect the workers' bold thinking, daring to act, and firm determination to advance towards culture.

    工人的画栩栩如生
    陕西展出全省工人绘画作品
    新华社西安14日电　陕西省工会联合会和中国美术家协会西安分会最近联合举办了陕西省工人画展。这是第一次全省范围的工人画展，共展出工人业余创作的漫画、宣传画、水彩画和素描等共三百多幅，是从大跃进以来千万幅工人作品中挑选出来的。
    这些作品生动的反映了生产大跃进、向技术、文化进军等各个方面的丰富内容。如铜川煤矿十八岁的采煤工王大钧画的“一场紧张的劳动后”，栩栩如生地描画了矿工在煤井休息时的欢乐情绪。在画面上，每个矿工都有鲜明的性格，他们谈笑着，有的手举水瓶豪饮，有的在嬉乐。宝鸡一个工厂十九岁的工人郑树华画的“建设中的姜城堡”，画上车水马龙，人头钻动，红旗飘扬，人们操纵着各种机械在紧张施工。画面构图均匀，色彩鲜明。手工业合作社社员张长松的国画“好好学”，运用传统的绘画技巧，画面上的老工人戴着眼镜，像教自己女儿一样辛苦的在教一个女徒工，女徒工喜形于色，虚心的向师傅学习。黄河棉织厂工人李守叶的漫画“前人足迹”，辛辣的讽刺了那种迷信前人走过的路是不会错的而墨守成规的人，画面上画着一个人背上背着一捆子书本谨小慎微的沿着前人的路子走，不敢越雷池一步。此外像“国棉三厂跃进图”、“家家户户一盏灯，处处都有读书声”等许多作品，都紧密结合当前现实，深刻的反映了工人敢想敢干和坚决向文化进军的豪迈气概。
