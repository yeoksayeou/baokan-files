Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 15th. Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, delivered concluding remarks this afternoon regarding the five-day discussion at the Fifth Party Congress.

Ulbricht first pointed out that the congress thoroughly discussed the party's general line. The outcome of the discussion indicated complete unity and clarity in understanding the prospect of socialism's inevitable victory in the German Democratic Republic and the path to achieve that victory. The congress proposed the task of eloquently proving the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system in West Germany through three years of diligent work. He expressed confidence that the party's general line would gain full support from all democratic parties and mass organizations united within the National Front.

Ulbricht further stated that the presence of delegations from over forty fraternal parties and congratulatory messages from many other communist and workers' parties underscored the fact that this congress further confirmed and consolidated the unity of socialist countries with all other communist and workers' parties on the basis of the Moscow Declaration. He emphasized, "This is a very significant achievement, because this unity contains the strength for the peace movement and the inevitable victory of socialism."

Ulbricht then said that even the enemy cannot ignore the significance of the tasks proposed by this congress. He said: If the enemy doubts the practicality of our new plan, then it is enough for us to point out that such remarks were already heard when we formulated the Two-Year Plan and the First Five-Year Plan. Just as those plans were completed and overfulfilled in the past, we are also confident in completing the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Because all these plans are based on the suggestions and strength of the working people.

Ulbricht pointed out that further proving the superiority of the socialist system will make the most significant contribution to resolving the German national question. He suggested that a committee composed of representatives from the two Germanies be formed in Berlin to resolve the German question. He emphasized that the German people must control their own destiny and make West Germany a region of peace. Ulbricht pointed out that solving the main economic tasks of the German Democratic Republic means strengthening the republic as a bastion of peace. All Germans will see which side offers peace, democracy, and increasing prosperity. Ulbricht, amidst enthusiastic applause, exclaimed: The speed of economic development in the German Democratic Republic must be accelerated so that "the east wind blows even more strongly in West Germany."

Ulbricht went on to say that the speed of economic development in the German Democratic Republic is of particular importance because West German militarists are doing everything possible to essentially complete the atomic armament of the West German army by 1961-1962.

Ulbricht pointed out that the further development of science and technology and the close integration of science and practice are of decisive significance in solving the main economic tasks.

Ulbricht expressed agreement with the suggestions of some democratic parties regarding holding report meetings for individual farmers, handicraftsmen, and private capitalists concerning their future and conducting open discussions with them. When discussing the socialist transformation of agriculture, Ulbricht pointed out that the rapid development of the agricultural collectivization movement must be valued.

Ulbricht then mentioned the issue of party and state organ staff participating in productive labor for a certain period. He said that the forms of labor can vary according to conditions. For example, some people can go to the countryside to help with the harvest and solve some of their job-related tasks on the spot; while responsible cadres from the departments of the State Planning Commission can go to a certain enterprise to participate in labor until the work of that enterprise is thoroughly improved.

In the final part of his two-hour concluding speech, Ulbricht discussed culture, art, and national education. He pointed out that the main tasks in these fields are to develop a socialist national culture, leading to a great cultural and artistic upsurge. In the national education sector, the required speed must be implemented, especially in the implementation of comprehensive technical education.

Ulbricht finally said that the task of strengthening the Socialist Unity Party of Germany as a fighting Marxist-Leninist party, as put forward by the Thirtieth Central Plenary Session, has been largely achieved. He pointed out that as long as the whole party makes every effort to implement the resolutions of the Fifth Congress, the complete victory of socialism in the German Democratic Republic is certain.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 15th. The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany unanimously adopted today the written summary report on the work of the party since the Fourth Congress, presented to the Congress by the Central Committee, and the speech by First Secretary Walter Ulbricht on the first day of the Congress on "Struggling for the Victory of Peace and Socialism" as the party's policy and fighting program.

The Congress also unanimously adopted the reports of the Central Inspection Committee, the Credentials Committee, the Drafting Committee, and the Proposals Committee. The Congress unanimously decided to entrust the new Central Committee to form a program committee to draft a draft of the party's program before the next Congress is convened.

Amidst warm applause, Ulbricht awarded the newly established "Red Banner of Glory" of the Central Committee to the party committees of the Karl-Marx-Stadt, Magdeburg, and Frankfurt districts, as well as the Weis-Muth mining area party committee, which had won the socialist production competition in greeting the Party Congress.

The Secretary-General of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party, Baghdadsh, was warmly welcomed when he addressed the Congress this afternoon. In his speech, Baghdadsh emphasized that Arab communists and all Arab progressives hope that the German people will achieve great success in the struggle to unify Germany in the spirit of peace and democracy.

When Baghdadsh spoke of the heroic struggle of the Lebanese people, which has lasted for two months, for freedom and independence, a long and sustained applause erupted in the hall. Baghdadsh said with confidence that the Arab countries will certainly repel the landed US troops, and the American tanks cannot destroy the people's fighting will. "The Arab East will erupt like a volcano and repel the barbaric invaders." He expressed his belief that more people will follow the example of the Iraqi people and break free from imperialist rule.

In addition to Wenzel, those who spoke at the morning meeting today included Paul Werner, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Glaser, First Secretary of the Gera District Party Committee, Namokel, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Free German Youth League, the writer and State Prize winner Chesno-Heil, and alternate Central Committee member Florin.

In his speech, Florin focused on proletarian internationalism. He condemned the revisionism of the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, saying that although the LCY leadership verbally claimed to follow proletarian internationalism, in reality, they colluded with the governments of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and supported the dirty slanders of imperialism against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. He expressed indignation at the slander of the LCY leaders who equated the People's Republic of China with the instigators of imperialist war. He pointed out that the Chinese comrades clearly stated that they do not want war, but they are not afraid of war. They fought for decades and drove imperialism out of their land. He emphasized that the Chinese people, who provided active assistance to the Korean people fighting for independence, are outstanding representatives of proletarian internationalism. They are respected by socialists all over the world.

    乌布利希在德国统一社会党代表大会作总结发言
    社会主义在民主德国必获全胜
    大会通过中央委员会总结报告和乌布利希的发言
    新华社柏林15日电　德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希今天下午就第五次党代表大会五天来的讨论作了总结发言。
    乌布利希首先指出，这次大会透彻地讨论了党的总路线。讨论结果表明，大家对于社会主义在民主德国必胜的远景和争取胜利的道路问题，在认识上是完全一致和明确的。大会提出了经过三年辛勤劳动来雄辩地证明社会主义制度比西德资本主义制度的优越性的任务。他表示确信党的总路线将获得所有团结在全国阵线内的各民主党派和群众团体的完全赞同。
    乌布利希又说，四十几个兄弟党代表团出席大会和另外许多其他共产党和工人党来电向大会致贺的事实强调说明，这次大会进一步证实和巩固了社会主义国家同所有其他国家共产党和工人党在莫斯科宣言基础上的团结。他强调说：“这是一个非常巨大的成就。因为这种团结中包含着和平运动和社会主义必将获得胜利的力量。”
    乌布利希接着说，甚至敌人也无法忽视这次大会所提出的任务的重要意义。他说：如果敌人怀疑我们新计划的现实性，那末我们只需指出这一点就够了：这样的话早在我们制订二年计划和第一个五年计划的时候就听到过了。正像过去完成和超额完成那些计划一样，我们也有把握提前完成第二个五年计划。因为所有这些计划都是以劳动人民的建议和力量为基础的。
    乌布利希指出，进一步证明社会主义制度的优越性，将为解决德国民族问题作出最重大的贡献。他建议，由两个德国的代表在柏林组成一个委员会来解决德国问题。他强调说，德国人民必须掌握自己的命运，使西德成为和平的地区。乌布利希指出，解决了民主德国的主要经济任务，也就是加强了作为和平堡垒的共和国。全体德国人都将看到：和平、民主和日益增长的繁荣究竟在哪一边。乌布利希在热烈的掌声中高呼：必须加快民主德国经济发展的速度，以便“让东风在西德吹得更猛烈”。
    乌布利希接着谈到，民主德国经济发展的速度问题所以具有特殊重要性，是因为西德军国主义者正在尽一切力量企图到1961—1962年基本上完成西德军队的原子武装。
    乌布利希指出，科学和技术的进一步发展以及科学和实践的紧密结合，对于解决主要经济任务有着决定性的意义。
    乌布利希表示赞同有些民主党派关于给个体农民、手工业者和私人资本家举办有关他们前途的报告会以及同他们进行公开讨论的建议。在谈到农业的社会主义改造问题时，乌布利希指出，必须重视农业合作化运动的飞快发展。
    乌布利希接着提到党和国家机关的工作人员在一定时期内参加生产劳动的问题，他说，劳动的形式可以按条件各有不同。比方说，有的人可以到农村帮助收获，并且就地解决同职务有关的一部分任务；而国家计划委员会主管部门的负责干部则可以到某个企业里去参加劳动，直到那个企业的工作获得彻底改进为止。
    乌布利希在历时两小时的总结发言的最后一部分谈到了文化、艺术和国民教育问题。他指出，在这些领域里的主要任务是：发展社会主义的民族文化，导致一个巨大的文化和艺术高潮。在国民教育部门中，特别是在实施综合技术教育方面，必须执行所要求的速度。
    乌布利希最后说，第三十次中央全会所提出的加强德国统一社会党作为一个马克思列宁主义的战斗的党的任务，已经在很大程度上实现了。他指出，只要全党尽一切努力贯彻第五次代表大会的决议，社会主义在民主德国的全胜是一定有把握的。
    据新华社柏林15日电　德国统一社会党第五次代表大会今天下午一致通过以中央委员会向大会提出的关于第四次代表大会以来党的工作的书面总结报告和中央第一书记乌布利希在大会第一天关于“为保障和平和社会主义的胜利而斗争”的发言作为党的政策和战斗纲领。
    大会还一致通过了中央检查委员会、资格审查委员会、编纂委员会和提案委员会的报告。大会一致决定委托新的中央委员会组成一个纲领委员会在下次代表大会召开以前起草党的纲领草案。
    在热烈掌声中，乌布利希把中央委员会新设置的“光荣红旗”授给了在迎接党代表大会的社会主义生产竞赛中获得优胜的卡尔·马克思斯塔特、马格德堡和法兰克福三个专区的党委会以及韦斯穆特矿区党委会。
    叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党总书记巴格达什今天下午向大会致词时受到了极为热烈的欢迎。巴格达什在发言中强调说，阿拉伯共产党人和全体阿拉伯进步人士都希望德国人民在争取根据和平民主精神统一德国的斗争中获得巨大成就。
    当巴格达什谈到黎巴嫩人民已经坚持达两月之久的争取自由独立的英勇斗争时，会场上响起了一片经久不息的掌声。巴格达什充满信心地说，阿拉伯国家一定会击退登陆的美军、美国的坦克不能摧毁人民的战斗意志。“阿拉伯东方会像火山爆发一样，击退野蛮的侵略者。”他表示相信还有更多的人会效法伊拉克人民的榜样，从帝国主义统治下挣脱出来。
    在今天上午会议上发言的除文策尔外，还有德国统一社会党中央委员会书记保罗·维尔纳，该拉专区党委第一书记格拉塞，自由德国青年联盟中央第一书记纳莫克尔，作家、国家奖金得奖人切斯诺—海尔和候补中央委员弗洛林。
    弗洛林在发言中着重谈到了无产阶级国际主义。他谴责南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团的修正主义说，尽管南共领导集团口头上说他们自己是遵循无产阶级国际主义的，然而实际上他们却同北大西洋集团国家的政府结成一伙，并且支持帝国主义对苏联和人民民主国家的肮脏污蔑。他对南共领导人把中华人民共和国同帝国主义战争挑拨者相提并论的诬蔑表示愤慨。他指出，中国同志清楚表明，他们不要战争，但是也不害怕战争。他们经过了几十年的斗争，从自己的土地上赶走了帝国主义。他强调说，曾经向为独立而战斗的朝鲜人民提供过积极援助的中国人民是无产阶级国际主义的杰出代表。他们受到全世界社会主义者的尊敬。
