    Singing Through a Thousand Years, Ten Thousand Years, Unending
    Worker, Han Tongliang
    They all say Yu the Great could control the floods,
    They all say the Foolish Old Man could move mountains,
    The heroic spirit is passed down to future generations,
    Hymns have been sung for thousands of years.
    Modern heroes number in the thousands,
    Doing more than just controlling floods and moving mountains,
    When we put our energy to work,
    We can transform the entire Earth!
    [Harbin "Street Poem"]

    千年万年唱不完
    工人  韩统良
    都说大禹能治水，
    都说愚公能搬山，
    英雄志气传后代，
    颂歌唱了几千年。
    现代英雄千千万，
    何止治水与搬山，
    我们干劲使起来，
    能把地球换一换！
    〔哈尔滨“街头诗”〕
