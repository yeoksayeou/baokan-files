Fujian Masses Work Together to Vigorously Reform Farm Tools
    Setting the Task: Focused Goals, Clear Direction  Writing the Article: Each Contributing Their Ability, Each Displaying Their Strengths

    (Our dispatch) The Fujian Provincial Party Committee, in the farm tool reform movement, instructed local leading organs to regularly sort and compare the masses' inventions and creations to see which problems had been solved and which remained unresolved. It then mobilized the masses to propose topics and ideas, organized them to innovate and create, and relied on them to evaluate and promote new farm tools. As a result, the farm tool reform movement throughout the province experienced a surge of clearly defined goals and a torrent of mass wisdom. By the end of May, statistics showed that the masses throughout the province had improved and created a total of 484 new types of farm tools, and promoted more than 370,000 pieces, averaging more than a dozen improvements and creations and more than 7,000 promotions every day.

    Fujian's "Setting the Task, Writing the Article" method in the farm tool reform movement mainly includes three types:

    The first is to organize the masses to "set the task" and the masses to "write the article" through the local Party newspaper. For example, the Fujian Daily successively published open letters from agricultural labor models Huang Baoluo, Xu Zechuan, and Wang Maoyu requesting the creation of rice transplanters, grass cutters, and harvesters, and published short commentaries calling for "the tasks to be set by everyone, the articles to be written by everyone," guiding the wisdom of the masses to several main farm tools and concentrating efforts to break through them. Subsequently, it reported on "essay responses" such as the wooden rice transplanter made in Changting County, the development of a cattle-drawn automatic seedling divider and transplanter in Yong'an County, the creation of a hand-pushed harvester in Luoyuan County, and the re-creation of a rapid harvester by the Provincial Farm Tool Experimental Factory, promoting the imitation and promotion by the masses throughout the province.

    The second is to organize the masses to "set the task" face-to-face and "write the article" upon returning through exhibitions and observation meetings. At the New Industrial Products Exhibition held in Fuzhou City on May 1, national labor model Zheng Yimu asked workers to help him find a way to dry rice with machines. Workers from the Fuzhou Farm Tool Factory immediately took on this "task" and mobilized the masses to "write a great article," finally with the factory engineer Cai Zhen designed an artificial foot-operated dryer based on the principle of a blower fan. With just two people operating it, it can dry 360 catties of wheat per hour. After the factory workers made this dryer, they introduced the drawings and explained the principles through newspapers to promote it to the masses.

    The third is for the leaders of grassroots production units such as agricultural cooperatives and factories to "set the task" to the masses of their units according to the main requirements of the masses in each period, and at the same time organize the masses of their units to "write the article" together. For example, during early rice transplanting, agricultural cooperatives everywhere universally proposed imitating rice transplanting boats and dense planting markers; after transplanting, they proposed improving old-style harrows and creating new-style cultivators; before the summer harvest, they proposed reforming threshing barrels and promoting fine threshing tools and other "tasks," requiring members to "those who can write articles should write articles, those who cannot write articles should copy articles," combining the key and the general, creation and imitation, and improvement and popularization, forming a mass farm tool reform movement. Fujian Province's adoption of the "Setting the Task, Writing the Article" method not only organized and led the masses to solve the urgently needed farm tool problems of the moment, but also vividly and specifically conducted a "everyone for me, me for everyone" socialist education for the people of the province. Whenever the newspaper published a new "task" from the masses, the editorial department would receive a batch of letters from readers, reflecting how many sleepless nights they had spent to write this "article," and sending various sketches. Zhou Bingjian, from the Yong'an County Cadre Spare-Time Cultural School, wrote a letter to the editorial department, saying that he did not understand mechanical principles and had no drafting tools, but he drew more than 20 sketches of various parts of the rice transplanter and sent them to the editorial department, hoping that he could make a small contribution to the great leap in agriculture. Whenever the newspaper published the news that a new farm tool had been successfully trial-produced, many people would send letters of congratulations and send their own unique opinions to the creators for reference and improvement. In the "Setting the Task, Writing the Article" farm tool reform movement, a communist style of great selflessness and concerted cooperation was radiating everywhere among the people.

### 福建群众通力协作大改农具  出题目——目标集中，方向明确  做文章——各尽所能，各展所长

    福建群众通力协作大改农具
    出题目——目标集中，方向明确  做文章——各尽所能，各展所长
    本报讯  中共福建省委在农具改革运动中指示各地领导机关经常地把群众的创造发明，进行排队、对照，看哪些问题解决了，哪些问题还未解决，然后发动群众出题目、出主意，组织群众创造发明，做文章，并依靠群众鉴定、推广新式农具后，全省的农具改革运动，顿时出现了主攻方向明确、群众智慧汹涌澎湃的局面。至5月底统计，全省群众改良、创造成功的新式农具共达四百八十四种，同时推广了三十七万多件，平均每天改良、创造十几件，推广七千多件。
    福建在农具改革运动中的“出题目、做文章”办法主要有三种：
    第一种是通过当地党报，组织群众“出题目”，群众“做文章”。如福建日报连续刊登了农业劳动模范黄宝洛、徐泽川、王茂玉要求创造插秧机、切草机、收割机的公开信，并发表了短评，号召“题目要大家来出，文章要大家来做”，把群众的智慧，引导到几件主要农具上，集中精力攻破它。随后报道长汀县制成木质插秧机、永安县发展为牛拉自动分秧插秧机，罗源县创造手推收割机、省农具试验厂再创快速收割器等“应征文章”，推动全省群众仿制、推广。
    第二种是通过展览会、观摩会，组织群众当面“出题目”，回去“做文章”。5月1日在福州市举办工业新产品展览会上，全国劳动模范郑依牳要求工人帮助他想办法用机器晒谷子。福州农具厂工人当场把这一“题目”包下来，回去发动群众“大作文章”，终于由该厂工程师蔡镇根据鼓风机的原理，设计一架人工踏动的烘干机，只要两人操作，每小时可烘干麦子三百六十斤。该厂工人把这种烘干机制成后，又通过报纸介绍图样，说明原理，向群众推广。
    第三种是由农业社、工厂等基层生产单位的领导，按照各个时期的群众主要要求，向本单位群众“出题目”，同时组织本单位群众人人动手“做文章”。如早稻插秧时，各地农业社普遍提出仿制插秧船、密植划行器；插秧以后，提出改良旧式耙，创造新式中耕器；夏收前又提出改造打谷桶和推广精打细收工具等“题目”，要求社员“会做文章的做文章，不会做文章的抄文章”，把重点和一般、创造和仿制、提高和普及结合起来，形成群众性的农具改革运动。福建省采用“出题目、做文章”的办法，不但组织领导群众重点解决了当前迫切需要的农具问题，而且生动具体地向全省人民进行了一次“人人为我、我为人人”的社会主义教育。每当报上登出群众新出的“题目”后，编辑部就收到一批读者来信，反映他们为了作此“文章”，熬过多少不眠之夜，并寄各种草图。永安县机关干部业余文化学校的周炳鉴给编辑部写信，说他不懂机械原理，又无制图工具，但他却画了插秧机各部件草图二十多幅寄给编辑部，希望自己能对农业大跃进有点微薄贡献。每当报上发表了新农具试制成功的消息后，很多人就去信祝贺并把自己研究的独到意见，寄给创造者参考、改进。在“出题目、做文章”的农具改革运动中，人们之间，到处焕发着大公无私、通力协作的共产主义风格。  （福建日报编辑部）
