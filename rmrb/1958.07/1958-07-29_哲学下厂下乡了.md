　　Philosophy Goes to Factories and the Countryside
　　Dake

　　Today, this newspaper published a report on the upsurge of workers and peasants studying philosophy in various parts of Heilongjiang Province, which once again illustrates that philosophy has broken through the small circle of a few people in academia and is increasingly penetrating the broad masses of workers and peasants. This marks the deepening development of the cultural revolution and also marks that the universal truth of Marxism is increasingly being grasped by the broad masses of workers and peasants. This will not only promote a further surge in production, but also create a great leap forward in philosophy itself.

　　In practice, workers and peasants originally had simple materialist ideas and acted in accordance with objective laws. Now, their consciousness has been further improved, and they demand to be able to consciously grasp the basic laws of dialectical materialism and become conscious dialectical materialists. Therefore, they urgently demand to learn philosophy. The fact that workers and peasants in various parts of Heilongjiang Province have proposed to consciously apply the principles of dialectical materialism to solve practical problems is a clear example.

　　However, not all comrades can correctly understand this demand of the workers and peasants. For example, when the workers of Mudanjiang Cement Plant requested to learn philosophy, some comrades initially adopted a skeptical attitude, not only failing to support them but even restricting them. They held a mysterious view of philosophy. They did not understand that the theory of dialectical materialism is the summary and generalization of the laws of the class struggle and production struggle of the working masses, and they did not understand that the workers and peasants have rich experience in class struggle and production struggle and are most likely to grasp the theory of dialectical materialism. The workers of Mudanjiang Cement Plant shattered this mysterious view of philosophy with practical actions. They broke through various restrictions, automatically organized study groups of Mao Zedong's works, and achieved great results. This demonstrates the great spirit of the working class. Their actions were encouraged and supported by the Provincial Party Committee, which called for handing philosophy and theory over to the workers and peasants, and thus a wave of workers and peasants learning philosophy was formed throughout the province.

　　Workers and peasants in various parts of Heilongjiang Province are learning philosophy in close connection with reality. They have greatly broken with dogmatism and are learning and applying at the same time. They have implemented the spirit of "learn what is needed, study while doing, debate while learning, and act while debating" in their study of philosophy, which has brought infinite vitality and combat effectiveness to philosophy itself. In the process of learning philosophy, workers and peasants will also promote the close combination of physical labor and mental labor, and gradually create a new type of working-class intellectuals and working-class philosophers and theorists.

　　Of course, workers and peasants will encounter certain difficulties in learning philosophy. Therefore, it is also necessary for philosophical workers to go deep into the masses to provide specific assistance, acting as both students and teachers, so that philosophy can be widely brought to factories and the countryside, and the upsurge of workers and peasants learning philosophy can be further promoted.

    哲学下厂下乡了
    大可
    今天本报发表的黑龙江省各地掀起工农群众学哲学热潮的报道，再一次地说明哲学已冲破了学术界少数人的小圈子，越来越广泛地深入到广大工农群众中去。这标志着文化革命的深入发展，也标志着马克思主义的普遍真理越来越多地为广大工农群众所掌握。这就不仅将推动生产的进一步高涨，而且将造成哲学本身的大跃进。
    工农群众在实践中原来大都有着朴素的唯物主义思想，并符合客观规律地办事。现在，他们的觉悟更加提高了，要求能够自觉地掌握辩证唯物主义的基本规律，成为自觉的辩证唯物主义者。因此，他们迫切地要求学哲学。黑龙江省各地工农群众提出要自觉地运用辩证唯物论的原理解决实际问题，就是一个明显的例子。
    但是，对于工农群众的这种要求，不是所有同志都能正确认识的。例如，在牡丹江水泥厂的工人提出要求学哲学时，起初有的同志就采取了怀疑的态度，不仅不予支持，甚至加以限制。他们对哲学抱着神秘的观点。他们不懂得辩证唯物主义的理论就是劳动群众的阶级斗争和生产斗争的规律的总结和概括，不懂得工农群众具有丰富的阶级斗争和生产斗争的经验，最容易掌握辩证唯物主义的理论。牡丹江水泥厂的工人以实际的行动粉碎了这种对哲学的神秘观点。他们打破了各种限制，自动组织起了学习毛泽东著作的小组，并且取得了很大成绩。这正表现了工人阶级的伟大气魄。他们的这种行动得到了省委的鼓励和支持，号召把哲学、把理论交给工农群众，于是，在全省范围内形成了一个工农群众学哲学的热潮。
    黑龙江省各地工农群众都是紧密联系实际来学哲学的。他们大破教条主义，做到边学边用。他们在学哲学中贯彻了“需要啥，学习啥，边学习，边辩论，边行动”的精神，这就给哲学本身带来了无限的生命力和战斗力。工农群众在学哲学的过程中，也必将促进体力劳动同脑力劳动的密切结合，逐步造就新型的工人阶级知识分子和工人阶级的哲学家及理论家。
    当然，工农群众在学哲学中会遇到一定的困难，因此，哲学工作者也有必要深入群众给以具体帮助，边做学生，边做先生，做到哲学广泛下厂下乡，促使工农群众学哲学的热潮进一步高涨。
