    Middle School Literature Textbooks Need to Compile New Folk Songs
    I think middle school literature textbooks should include some new folk songs and ballads. Because these folk songs and ballads are the magnificent songs of the Great Leap Forward sung from the hearts of workers and peasants, they are the sound of the times. These "new national airs" and "new Chu poems" are often powerful in wording, magnificent in momentum, easy to read and speak, vivid and simple in language, and very rich in imagination. Reading them can not only cultivate students' thoughts and feelings for the working people, but also improve their writing ability. It is suggested that some new folk songs and ballads be compiled into middle school literature textbooks. Chen Zhen

    中学文学课本需要编选新民歌
    我认为中学文学课本中应该编选些新民歌、民谣。因为这些民歌、民谣都是从工人、农民心坎中唱出的大跃进的雄壮歌声，它是时代的声音。这些“新国风”、“新楚辞”往往字句铿锵有力、气势磅礴，读起来朗朗上口、语言生动、淳朴，想像力非常丰富。读了它不但能培养学生的劳动人民思想感情，而且能提高写作能力。建议中学文学课本中编选一些新民歌、民谣。  陈震
