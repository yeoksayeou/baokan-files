Xinhua News Agency, London, July 27th: A British newspaper reporter reported from Baghdad that Baghdad is calm and the entire country is under the complete control of the Iraqi Republic government. The reporter said that everyone he spoke to, including people in the countryside, told him that the new regime was "very good."

According to the reporter, the palace of the Iraqi Faisal dynasty and the residence of Nuri al-Said, a running dog of imperialism, have become places for public sightseeing. The reporter said that crowds of people are flocking from afar to visit the relics of the overthrown old dynasty.

He said that the gold bars, gems, and diamonds in the palace have been handed over to the Ministry of Defense for safekeeping. According to government officials, these treasures will be returned to the plundered people through investments in the construction of housing and water conservancy projects.

    新华社27日讯　伦敦消息：据英国报纸的一个记者从巴格达报道，巴格达是平静的，全国都在伊拉克共和国政府的完全控制之下。记者说，他所交谈过的人，包括乡村里的人，都对他说新政权“非常好”。
    据记者报道，伊拉克费萨尔王朝的王宫和帝国主义走狗努里·赛义德的官邸已经成为供公众参观游览的地方。这个记者说，群众都从很远的地方络绎不绝地前往参观这个已被推翻的旧王朝的遗物。
    他说，王宫中的金条、宝石和钻石已经交由国防部负责保管。据政府官员宣布，这些财宝将以投资建筑住宅和水利工程的方式来归还给被掠夺的人民。
