    Undeliverable Letter Delivered

    On May 19th, the Zhangjiakou City Post and Telecommunications Bureau received a letter addressed to "Comrade Ma Shan, Zhangjiakou City transfer." According to postal regulations, since the recipient's address was incomplete, the letter should have been returned to the sender. However, when the letter was given to Comrade Dong Shuzheng, the clerk responsible for sorting returned mail, she noticed that the sender's address was the Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce. She then thought that the recipient might work at the Municipal Bureau of Commerce. During her lunch break, she inquired at the Bureau of Commerce and indeed found that there was a Comrade Ma Shan. This is how an undeliverable letter was finally delivered.

    I am not suggesting that the post office must deliver all letters with incomplete addresses, but the fact that Comrade Dong Shuzheng was able to find a way to deliver a letter that could not be delivered shows a dedication to serving the people that is truly worth emulating.

    无法投递的信送到了
    5月19日，张家口市邮电局收到一封信，信封上写着“张家口市转马山同志”，根据邮章规定，没有受信人地址，应该把原信退回寄信人。当这封信转给整理退信的业务员董淑征同志时，她看到寄信人的地址写的是河北省商业厅，于是想到受信人可能在市商业局工作。在中午休息时间，她就到商业局打听，果然打听到商业局有一个马山同志。这样使一封无法投递的信终于投到了。
    我并不强调邮局一定要把地址不详的信件都送到，但董淑征同志能想法把一件不能送到的信送到了，这种热心为群众服务的工作态度确实值得学习。
