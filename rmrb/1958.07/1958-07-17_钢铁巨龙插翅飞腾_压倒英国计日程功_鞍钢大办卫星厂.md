Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 16th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Minghui reports): Anshan Iron and Steel has decided to work hard for half a year to build more than 50 small and medium-sized converters with a steelmaking capacity of 3.5 million tons and more than 200 small and medium-sized blast furnaces with an ironmaking capacity of 4.5 million tons by the end of this year. This will ensure that the steel production of this large steel base will have an unprecedented leap forward in the next two years.

　　A large enterprise fully utilizes its human and material potential, implements the policy of combining large, medium, and small, and massively builds small and medium-sized blast furnaces and converters while building large blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces. This is a significant innovation.

　　Currently, more than 20 small blast furnaces have broken ground in and around the factory area of this large steel enterprise, six of which have already produced iron. It is expected that most of the small and medium-sized blast furnaces and converters to be built this year will be basically completed in the third quarter.

　　The effective volume of the medium-sized blast furnaces under construction, about to be constructed, and already in production ranges from 3 cubic meters, 13 cubic meters, 33 cubic meters, 55 cubic meters to 100 cubic meters. The converters range from one ton, three tons, six tons to twelve tons. After they are put into production, together with the new and rebuilt large blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces being put into production and the existing blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces tapping their production potential, this year's steel output of Anshan Iron and Steel will be far from just a 19% increase over last year as planned by the state at the beginning of the year, nor just a 48% increase as in the recently revised leap forward plan, but an increase of 62% to 72%. Next year's steel output will increase even more than this year. This kind of leap-forward development speed is an unprecedented miracle not only in our country, but also in all industrially developed capitalist countries.

　　The more than 200 small and medium-sized blast furnaces and more than 50 converters to be built this year will all be contracted by various mines and related factories in collaboration, without state investment. According to preliminary investigations, most of the materials and equipment needed for these more than 200 small and medium-sized blast furnaces and more than 50 converters can be solved by using old materials and old equipment; the insufficient part will tap the potential of Anshan Iron and Steel's machinery repair departments and manufacture them simply. Many small blast furnaces will be built with stones and red bricks, using very limited steel.

　　Due to the full utilization of old materials and old equipment, the investment in each blast furnace and converter is very small. A small blast furnace of 3 cubic meters only costs a few hundred yuan, and a blast furnace of 55 cubic meters only requires an investment of about 100,000 yuan, including the depreciated cost of old materials and old equipment.

　　The technical workers needed for the production and construction of small and medium-sized blast furnaces and converters are mainly drawn from within the factories and mines, and the needs of production and construction are guaranteed through short-term training and the method of apprenticeship.

　　According to the construction time of the small blast furnaces and small converters that have been put into production, the construction speed is very fast due to simplification and full utilization of old materials, as well as the high enthusiasm of the workers. A small blast furnace of 3 cubic meters only takes six days from construction to iron production, and the construction time of a small blast furnace of 55 cubic meters only takes about ten days.

　　The construction of this batch of small and medium-sized blast furnaces and converters is of great benefit to the full utilization of underground resources.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 16th. Anshan Iron and Steel's large blast furnace and two large open-hearth furnaces, which started construction not long ago, are running side by side like racing horses. The builders of the open-hearth furnaces told reporters that they would complete these two largest open-hearth furnaces in our country about a quarter ahead of schedule, to ensure the production of more steel to support the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production.

    钢铁巨龙插翅飞腾　压倒英国计日程功
    鞍钢大办卫星厂
    据新华社鞍山16日电　新华社记者孙铭惠报道：鞍钢决定大干、苦干半年，在今年年底前建成拥有三百五十万吨炼钢能力的中小型转炉五十多座，拥有四百五十万吨炼铁能力的中小型高炉二百多座，保证这个大钢铁基地的钢铁产量在今明两年能有一个空前的大跃进。
    一个大企业充分运用它的人力物力的潜力，实行大中小结合的方针，在建设大高炉大平炉同时，大量建设中小型高炉和转炉，是一个有重大意义的创举。
  目前，这个大钢铁企业的厂区和厂区周围，已有二十多座小高炉破土动工，其中有六座已经出铁。预计在第三季度，今年要建设的大部分中小型高炉和转炉，都可以基本完工。
    正在动工、即将施工和已经投入生产的中型高炉的有效容积，从三立方公尺、十三立方公尺、三十三立方公尺、五十五立方公尺到一百立方公尺不等，转炉从一吨、三吨、六吨到十二吨。它们投入生产以后，加上新建改建的大高炉大平炉投入生产和原有高炉平炉发挥生产潜力，今年鞍钢钢产量将远不是像年初国家计划的只比去年增长19％，也不是像不久前重新修订的跃进计划只增长48％，而是增长62％到72％；明年的钢产量，将比今年增加得更多。这种飞跃的发展速度，不仅在我国，就是在一切工业发达的资本主义国家，也是史无前例的奇迹。
    今年要建成的这二百多座中小型高炉和五十多座转炉，都由各矿和有关厂协作包建，不要国家投资。据初步调查，这二百多座中小型高炉和五十多座转炉所需要的材料和设备，绝大部分都可以利用旧材料、旧设备解决；不足的部分，将发挥鞍钢机修部门的潜力，因陋就简地制造。许多小高炉都将采用石头、红砖砌起来，用的钢材极有限。
    由于充分利用旧材料旧设备，每座高炉转炉的投资很少，一座三立方公尺的小高炉只要几百元，五十五立方公尺的高炉，包括旧材料旧设备折价费用在内，也只要十万元左右的投资。
    中小型高炉和转炉生产建设所需要的技术工人，主要由各厂矿从内部抽调，通过短期训练和带徒弟的办法，保证生产建设的需要。
    根据已经投入生产的小高炉小转炉的建设时间计算，由于因陋就简和充分利用旧材料，以及职工群众的高度积极性，建设速度都十分快。一个三立方公尺的小高炉从施工到出铁只要六天的时间，一个五十五立方公尺小高炉的建设时间，也只要十天左右。
    这批中小型高炉和转炉的建设，对于充分利用地下资源有很大好处。
    据新华社鞍山16日电　鞍钢不久前开始施工的一座大高炉和两座大平炉，如同赛跑着的骏马一样，正在并肩飞驰。平炉的建设者们告诉记者说，他们要提前一个季度左右建成这两座我国最大的平炉，保证生产更多的钢支援全国工农业生产大跃进。（附图片）
