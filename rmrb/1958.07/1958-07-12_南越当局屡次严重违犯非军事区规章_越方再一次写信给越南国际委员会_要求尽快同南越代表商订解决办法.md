Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 11th: It is announced here that Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army, wrote to the International Commission on July 3, expressing regret over the South Vietnamese authorities' repeated refusal to contact the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to discuss and resolve issues related to the regulations of the Demilitarized Zone.

Due to the South Vietnamese authorities' repeated and serious violations of the Demilitarized Zone regulations, and following accusations from the Vietnam People's Army side, the International Commission suggested on April 12th of this year that representatives from both North and South Vietnam make contact in the Demilitarized Zone on May 14th to discuss the aforementioned issues. After receiving the International Commission's suggestion, the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the International Commission twice, expressing its willingness to meet with representatives of the South Vietnamese authorities at any time, according to the International Commission's suggestion. However, the South Vietnamese authorities wrote to the International Commission twice refusing to make such contact, using the excuse that "such contact is neither necessary nor beneficial."

At the same time, the South Vietnamese authorities put forward some measures violating the Demilitarized Zone regulations as preconditions for the meeting, such as demanding that the Ben Hai River be divided into two parts by an "imaginary boundary line"; demanding that the number of armed police on the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone be doubled; and demanding changes to the Demilitarized Zone Joint Commission's method of issuing permits, etc.

In his letter, Ha Van Lau pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities' increasingly serious violations of the Demilitarized Zone regulations have exacerbated the tense situation in the Demilitarized Zone. The letter said: Since November 1955, the South Vietnamese authorities have refused to issue permits to people needing to travel across the Provisional Military Demarcation Line; they have strengthened armed forces on the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone, and have allowed their administrative and military personnel, and even American advisors, to enter and exit the southern section of the Demilitarized Zone without obtaining permits from the Joint Commission. The International Commission has reflected some of these situations in its Sixth and Seventh Reports to the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference. The International Commission has also expressed concern several times about the situation in the Demilitarized Zone because the Joint Commission could not resume its activities. In his letter, Ha Van Lau requested the International Commission to take appropriate measures to ensure that the South Vietnamese authorities fully implement the Demilitarized Zone regulations.

Ha Van Lau once again stated that the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army is willing to meet with representatives of the South Vietnamese authorities as soon as possible, according to the International Commission's suggestion of April 12th, in order to jointly seek solutions to the problems related to the Demilitarized Zone.

    南越当局屡次严重违犯非军事区规章
    越方再一次写信给越南国际委员会
    要求尽快同南越代表商订解决办法
    新华社河内11日电　这里公布，越南人民军联络代表团团长何文楼上校在7月3日写信给国际委员会，对南越当局一再拒绝同越南民主共和国方面进行接触来讨论解决有关非军事区的一些规章问题表示遗憾。
    由于南越当局屡次严重地违犯非军事区的规章，在越南人民军方面的控诉之下，今年4月12日，国际委员会曾经建议越南北、南双方各派代表于5月14日在非军事区进行接触，并且讨论上述问题。在接到国际委员会的建议之后，越南人民军总司令部方面曾经两次写信给国际委员会，表示愿意根据国际委员会的建议，随时同南越当局的代表会晤。但是，南越当局却两次写信给国际委员会拒绝进行这种接触，它的借口是：“这种接触没有什么必要和益处”。
    同时，南越当局却提出了一些违犯非军事区规章的办法作为会晤的先决条件，例如。要求用一个“想像的界线”来把边海河划成两个部分；要求把非军事区南边的武装警察人数增加一倍；要求改变非军事区联合委员会发通行证的办法等。
    何文楼在信中指出，南越当局这种越来越严重的侵犯非军事区规章的行为，加剧了非军事区的紧张局势。信中说：从1955年11月起，南越当局不肯给需要在临时军事分界线来往的人民签发通行证，他们在非军事区南边加强武装力量，并且在没有取得联合委员会的许可证的情况下，就让他们的行政和军事人员，甚至美国顾问进出非军事区南段。国际委员会在给日内瓦会议两位主席的第六号和第七号报告中曾经反映了一部分这类情况。国际委员会也曾经几次因为联合委员会不能恢复活动而对非军事区的局势表示忧虑。何文楼在信中要求国际委员会采取适当的措施来使南越当局彻底执行非军事区的规章。
    何文楼再一次表示，越南人民军总司令部方面愿意根据国际委员会4月12日的建议，尽快同南越当局的代表会晤，以便共同寻求解决有关非军事区问题的办法。
