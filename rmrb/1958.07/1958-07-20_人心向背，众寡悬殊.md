I don't want to describe yesterday's magnificent parade again. Whether it be the ocean-like ranks, the forest-like fists and flags, or the earth-shaking cries of anger, all of this needs no further description. Because this is not only known throughout our country, but also throughout the world, and even those invaders who are frightened but pretend to be calm cannot block it. American and British journalists have diluted this grand parade again and again, but they still cannot help but reveal this grand occasion in their writings. Although they say we are close to "madness," we know what color to show the warmongers, what sounds to make them hear.

I want to record some of the discussions of the paraders. These discussions from the mouths of the masses, like the earth-shaking cries of anger, are also the voices of the just, great, glorious, and brave people.

— The people of Iraq have done a good job! Look at how they turned the world upside down overnight, completely destroying the cornerstone of the Baghdad Pact organized by the American invaders. How small are those vicious tyrants! They were pinched to death by the people's fingers like ants. Look at how decisively the Iraqi people's revolution was carried out, without hesitation to kill those traitors; withdraw from the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation; close the Baghdad Pact office; withdraw troops stationed in Jordan; designate troops in Lebanon to join the insurgents; establish contacts with all peace-loving countries—a series of revolutionary measures. Use ruthless hands to heavily strike the invaders, without any procrastination.

— The people of Lebanon and Jordan are also such people. They will surely gain this glory for their courageous actions and become great people admired by the world.

— The people all over the world who are warmly supporting Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan, and opposing aggression, are all such people. They will eventually use their actions to gain new glory again.

However, how despicable, shameless, and insignificant are the invaders!

— The British are just bullies who rely on their master's power, following the Americans to their deaths.

— I heard that after the news of the victory of the Iraqi people's revolution was first transmitted to Britain, a Western journalist described that Britain was filled with an atmosphere of pessimism and worry. Yes, the British had suffered in Egypt and were not as bold as before, so they were pessimistic and worried. However, when the big boss of imperialism, the United States, took the lead in sending troops, they began to stir again. They were confident that this backer was very reliable, and this time they might avoid suffering greatly. In fact, even the United States itself is a paper tiger. In Korea, the United States, leading the so-called sixteen-nation coalition, was beaten bloody and battered by us. There are warriors from the Korean battlefield in our ranks, and there must be veterans among the American invaders who knelt down and begged for mercy in front of us. They went to Lebanon, not with pleasure, and of course, they will return disappointed.

— The United States and Britain are a pair of brothers in misfortune. They really seem to be "unwilling to be born on the same day of the same month of the same year, but willing to die on the same day of the same month of the same year." This is an alliance of two walking corpses, who will die without a burial place and leave a stench for ten thousand years.

There is no need to add any more comparisons. Justice and injustice, glory and shamelessness, greatness and insignificance, unity and isolation, like the dragon-like parade and the British who bowed their heads to listen to the reading of the protest, the disparity between the many and the few is so clear at a glance. The popular sentiment has long predetermined the outcome of this war. Glory is waiting for the great people, as long as we show courage.

    人心向背，众寡悬殊
    葛德
    我不想再描述昨天游行的盛况。无论那海洋般的行列也好，那森林般的拳头和旗帜也好，那震撼人心的愤怒喊声也好，这一切都无需再加描述。因为，这不仅是我们举国皆知，而且是举世皆知，而且是那些吓得心惊肉跳而又故作镇静的侵略者们也都无法封锁的了，美国的和英国的新闻记者，对这声势浩大的游行，冲淡了再冲淡，但是仍然不能不从他们的笔下，把这盛况透露出去。尽管它们说我们这是近于“疯狂”，但我们知道应该给战争狂人什么颜色看，什么声音听。
    我要记下游行人们的一点议论，这些来自群众口中的议论，同那震撼天地的愤怒喊声一样，同样是正义、伟大、光荣而又勇敢的人民的心声。
    ——伊拉克人民干得好！你看他们一夜之间就使天翻地复，彻底毁掉了美国侵略者组织的巴格达条约的基石，那凶恶的暴君们是何等的渺小，他们像些蚂蚁一样的被人民的指头抿死。你看，伊拉克人民革命多干脆，决不迟疑地杀死那些卖国贼；退出伊约联邦；封闭巴格达条约的办公处；撤回在约旦的驻军；指定在黎巴嫩的军队参加起义军；同一切爱好和平的国家建立联系，一连串的革命措施。用无情的手，重重的打击侵略者，毫不拖泥带水。
    ——黎巴嫩和约旦的人民也是这样的人民，他们也必将因自己的勇敢行动而获得这种光荣，成为举世景仰的伟大人民。
    ——全世界正在热烈声援伊拉克、黎巴嫩、约旦，反对侵略的人民，都是这样的人民，他们终将用自己的行动再次获得新的光荣。
    然而，侵略者又是何等的卑鄙无耻、和渺小啊！
    ——英国人嘛，那是狐假虎威，跟在美国屁股后边找死的。
    ——听说在伊拉克人民革命胜利消息刚刚传到英国以后，有一个西方的新闻记者描述说，在英国，整个充满了悲观和忧虑的气氛。是的，英国人在埃及吃过了苦头，不像以前那样大胆了，所以悲观、忧虑。可是，当帝国主义的大首领美国带头出兵以后，他又开始蠢动了，他满以为这靠山是很可靠的，这次也许免于大吃苦头。其实，就连美国自己也是纸老虎。在朝鲜以美国为首号称十六国联军的，也被我们打得头破血流、落花流水。我们这行列里就有朝鲜战场上的勇士，在美国侵略者的行列中，难免没有曾在我们面前下跪求饶的老手。他们去黎巴嫩，既不是乘兴而去，当然更会败兴而归。
    ——美国、英国，难兄难弟两个。真像是有些“不愿同年同月同日生，但愿同年同月同日死”的样子，这是两具行尸的结盟，将死无葬地，遗臭万年。
    无需再加什么比较了。正义和无道，光荣和无耻，伟大和渺小，团结和孤立，如同巨龙般的游行队伍和那垂头倾听宣读抗议书的英国人对比一样，众寡悬殊，是如此的一目了然。人心的向背，是早已预决了这场战争的胜负的。光荣正在等待着伟大的人们，只要我们表现了勇敢。
