    Establishing Models, Using Facts, Pointing Out Paths
    Nanchong Prefecture's Technical Revolution Movement Centered on Agricultural Tool Reform is Developing Well; Neijiang Prefectural Committee Points Out That Agricultural Tool Reform Should be Targeted
    (This newspaper report by reporters Yu Jingqi and Wang Huandou): The Communist Party committees at all levels in Nanchong Prefecture, Sichuan Province, have achieved great success in the technical revolution movement centered on agricultural tool reform by adopting the method of establishing red flags to mobilize and educate the masses. This leadership method provides some experience on how to implement the mass line through key points in the technical revolution.
    The so-called red flag refers to an agricultural cooperative at the forefront of the technical revolution (now it seems that it can also be used in a township, a district, or even a larger area). This agricultural cooperative is cultivated under the personal guidance of the leadership. Since March of this year, Nanchong Prefecture has adopted this method, and the technical revolution movement centered on agricultural tool reform has greatly accelerated. Agricultural cooperatives throughout the region have established 5,800 tool manufacturing plants, and promoted more than one million pieces of various new agricultural tools, accounting for about two-thirds of all new tools. More than 54,000 li of cart roads have been built, and more than 2,000 cooperatives (including an entire county) have switched entirely to cart transportation. The construction of hydropower stations is far ahead of other prefectures in Sichuan Province, with newly completed and under-construction projects accounting for more than one-half of the province's total. Currently, 13,000 peasant households have electric lights.
    At the beginning of the agricultural tool reform in Nanchong Prefecture this spring, most farmers were unfamiliar with the new tools, had various doubts, and lacked experience and technology on how to reform. In order to accelerate the development of the movement, according to the Party's long-term experience in mass work, the Nanchong Prefectural Committee instructed all localities to adopt the leadership method of establishing red flags. Subsequently, this experience was extended to hydropower station construction, farming system reform, and farming technology reform. The basic approach to establishing red flags is: Party committees at all levels personally take action, select representative agricultural cooperatives, and dispatch more technical cadres to help them. Various inventions and advanced technologies are first concentrated here for promotion, and a flag is established. Then, visits are organized, on-site meetings are held to promote mass learning, and everyone is encouraged to catch up with this example.
    The benefits of this method are manifested in:
    (1) Because it uses facts made by the masses themselves to speak, it has unparalleled persuasiveness in educating the masses. Through these examples, Nanchong Prefecture has made rapid progress in the past few months in raising the masses' understanding of the principles and policies of the technical revolution and breaking conservative ideas. For example, when Xichong County carried out cart transportation, some people proposed: "We are mountainous areas, and cart transportation cannot be too fast," and "Agricultural work is too busy, and there is no time." While these people were hesitating and watching, the "Red Flag Cooperative" - Heming No. 1 Cooperative, led by the County Party Committee, opened the entire cooperative's road network in six days and realized cart transportation. Therefore, the county's cart transportation was achieved in ten days of hard work.
    (2) In disseminating experience and technology, because the masses themselves are giving examples and explaining on-site, it is specific, vivid, and easy to understand, so that experience and technology can be promoted more, faster, better, and more economically. Most of the ten technical training classes held in Nanbu County were held on the site of these cooperatives. The masses learned and worked at the same time, and quickly trained more than 10,000 people. In April, the entire region trained more than 10,000 iron and wood craftsmen who could manufacture various improved agricultural tools through these agricultural cooperatives.
    (3) Because various new technologies are first concentrated and comprehensively promoted through the "Red Flag Cooperative," the effect is outstanding, far exceeding the practice of spreading out sparsely in all directions.
    (4) Through the establishment of red flags, it is also possible to better promote appraisal and competition. In this way, on the one hand, the red flag promotes the backward, and on the other hand, it promotes the "Red Flag Cooperative" itself to leap forward even more, thus forming a situation of "the backward catching up with the advanced, and the advanced becoming more advanced."
    (This newspaper report by reporter Liu Zongtang): The Neijiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions, requiring all counties to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the agricultural tool innovation movement, and guide the masses' enthusiasm for creation and improvement to the tools urgently needed for current production; the practice of not adapting to local conditions and not starting from existing conditions in some areas must be changed quickly.
    After the agricultural tool innovation movement in Neijiang Prefecture was fully launched in April, it quickly formed a mass movement. Some new agricultural tools can increase work efficiency by several times to dozens of times, directly promoting production. According to a recent inspection, because the direction of agricultural tool reform work in various places is not clear enough, and political and ideological leadership lags behind the actions of the masses, the result is such a situation: Various new agricultural tools have been created and reformed in various places, but progress in water-carrying tools and seeding tools has been slow, and some have even remained unchanged. These two are precisely the tools that currently occupy the most labor and have the greatest relationship with increasing production this year. Some areas even abandoned the foundation of existing tools, greedy for new and big things, and unrealistically attempted to achieve mechanization and automation all at once. For example, some places have not yet solved the problem of electricity, but now they have spent a lot of manpower trying to manufacture electric water pumps, electric crushers, etc. Each county has manufactured some large and complex agricultural tools that cannot be used at present.
    The Prefectural Committee inspection team also found another noteworthy problem: There are more serious disconnections between the trial production and promotion, production and distribution, technical guidance and mass creation in the agricultural tool innovation movement in various places. Some tools have been successfully trial-produced and are needed by farmers, but no department is responsible for production and have to be displayed at exhibitions for a long time; some tools are still in the trial production process, but are produced in batches. Prices, quality, and specifications are also more chaotic. The masses urgently need technical guidance in the creation process, but cannot get strong help. The reform of some tools has already been solved in other areas, but many places are still buried in research, wasting a lot of labor.
    The Neijiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that if the above situation is not changed in time, it will dampen the enthusiasm of the masses and affect the healthy development of the agricultural tool innovation movement. The Prefectural Committee requires all localities to quickly strengthen political and ideological leadership, both to cherish and actively support the masses' enthusiasm for technical innovation, and to be good at guiding it to the main aspects, so as to be targeted. All localities may adopt the method of "raising questions and writing articles," closely combining current production within a certain period of time, and making a concentrated attack on one or two main tools. This can achieve the purpose of short time, quick results, low cost, and great effectiveness. The instructions emphasized that agricultural tool innovation should progress from low-level to high-level, from simple to complex, and transition from improving existing agricultural tools to using advanced mechanical agricultural tools entirely.
    In order to speed up the progress of agricultural tool innovation work, the Neijiang Prefectural Committee also put forward the following specific measures: 1. Counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives should immediately establish organizations to be responsible for the unified leadership of the trial production, promotion, production, and distribution of improved agricultural tools. 2. Adjust, replenish, and develop the manufacturing and repair organizations of improved agricultural tools, and gradually form the region's agricultural tool network. 3. All localities should set up a technical research group to patrol the site for technical guidance. 4. Carry out communist cooperation, and all localities should actively exchange experiences and information, support each other, visit, and access. In case of major problems, they can cooperate fully to break through, so that the agricultural tool innovation movement can be carried out more deeply and widely. (Attached picture)
    The Henan Province's improved tool movement has been universally launched throughout the province. Changge County alone has manufactured and improved more than 160,000 pieces of transportation, harvesting, plowing, water lifting, and small agricultural tools. The picture shows the hand-cranked wheat threshing machine created by Zengfumiao Township, Changge County. One person cranks, and four people continue to feed wheat. It can thresh twenty mu of wheat per day.

    树立典型  运用事实  指明途径
    南充专区以农具改革为中心的技术革命运动开展得好
    内江地委指出改革农具要有的放矢
    本报讯　记者于竟祁、王焕斗报道：四川省南充专区各地中共党委，在以农具改革为中心的技术革命运动中，采取树立红旗的办法发动和教育群众，获得很大成绩。这种领导方法对在技术革命中怎样通过重点贯彻群众路线，提供了一些经验。
    所谓红旗，是指在技术革命中走在最前面的一个农业社（现在看来，也可用在一乡，一区，或者更大些的范围）。这种农业社是在领导亲自动手下培养成长的。今年3月份以来，南充专区采取这种方法，以农具改革为中心的技术革命运动大大加快。全区各农业社建立了五千八百个工具制造厂，推广各种新农具、新工具达一百万件以上，约占全部新工具的三分之二。车子路修了五万四千多里，有两千多个社（包括一个整县）全部用车子运输。水电站建设已在四川省各专区遥遥领先，新建竣工的和正在修建的约占全省二分之一以上。现在，已有一万三千户农民点上电灯。
    今年春天南充专区实行农具改革之初，大多数农民对新工具不熟悉，有各种疑虑，同时如何改革也缺乏经验和技术。为了加快运动的发展，根据党的长期群众工作经验，南充地委指示各地采取树立红旗的领导方法。随后这一经验又推广到水电站建设、耕作制度和耕作技术的改革等方面。树立红旗的基本作法是：各级党委亲自动手，选择有代表性的农业社，抽调较多的技术干部去帮助，各种创造发明和先进技术首先集中在这里推广，树立起旗帜。然后，再组织参观、召开现场会议，推动群众学习，鼓舞大家向这个榜样追赶。
    这种方法的好处表现在：
    （一）由于是用群众自己做出来的事实说话，因而在教育群众方面就具有无比的说服力。通过这些榜样，南充专区几个月来在提高群众对技术革命的方针政策的认识，打破保守思想方面取得了迅速的进展。例如，西充县开展车子化时有些人提出：“我们是山区，车子化不能太快”、“农活太忙，没有时间”。就是在这些人犹豫观望中，县委领导的“红旗社”——鹤鸣一社六天就修通了全社道路网，实现了车子化。因此，全县车子化苦战十天就实现了。
    （二）在传播经验、传播技术中，由于是群众自己现身说法，现场讲解，因而具体、生动、易懂，也就能使经验、技术推广得又多、又快、又好、又省。南部县举办的十种技术训练班大都是在这些社的现场举办，群众边学边作，很快就训练了一万多人。4月份，全区通过这些农业社就培养出一万多能制造各种改良农具的铁、木工匠。
    （三）由于各种新技术是首先通过“红旗社”集中、全面地推广，因而效果突出，远远超过全面开花零星分散的作法。
    （四）通过树立红旗，还可以更好地推动评比竞赛。这样，一方面通过红旗促进后进，一方面又推动了“红旗社”本身更加跃进，从而形成了一个“后进追先进，先进更先进”的局面。
    本报讯　记者刘宗棠报道：中共四川省内江地委最近发出指示，要求各县加强对农具革新运动的政治思想领导，把群众的创造改良热情引导到解决当前生产急需的工具上来；部分地区不因地制宜，不从现有条件出发的作法，必须迅速改变。
    内江专区农具革新运动在4月份全面展开后，很快就形成了一个全民性的运动。有些新农具能提高工效几倍到几十倍，直接推动了生产。据最近检查，由于各地对农具改革工作的方向不够明确，政治思想领导落后于群众的行动，结果出现了这样一个情况：各地创造和改革了不少新农具，但在担水工具和播种工具两方面进展却很迟缓，有的甚至原封未动，而这两项正是当前占用劳力最多和今年增产关系最大的工具。部分地区甚至撇开了现有工具的基础，贪新求大，不切实际地企图一下就实现机械化、自动化。如有的地方连电力问题都还没有解决，现在却花了很多人力去试制电动抽水机、电动粉碎机等。各县几乎都制造了一些目前无法使用的庞大复杂的农具。
    地委检查团还发现另一个值得注意的问题：各地在农具革新运动中试制和推广、生产与分配、技术指导和群众创造等方面，存在有比较严重的脱节现象。有些工具已经试制成功，农民需要，却没有部门负责生产，不得不长期摆在展览会上；有的工具还在试制过程，反而成批生产。在价格、质量和规格上也较混乱。群众在创造过程中迫切需要技术指导，得不到有力的帮助。有些工具的改革早已为其他地区解决，不少地方还在埋头钻研，浪费许多劳动力。
    中共内江地委认为上述情况如不及时改变，将会挫伤群众的积极性，影响农具革新运动的健康发展。地委在指示中要求各地迅速加强政治思想领导，既要爱护和积极支持群众的技术革新热情，又要善于把它引导到主要方面上来，做到有的放矢，各地不妨采用“出题目，做文章”的办法，在一定的时间内紧密结合当前生产，突击一两项主要工具，这样做能够达到时间短、收效快、成本低、功效大的目的。指示强调指出农具革新应该由低级到高级，由简单到复杂，由改良现有农具出发，过渡到全部使用高级的机械农具。
    为加快农具革新工作的进行，内江地委还提出下列几项具体措施：一、县、区、乡、社都要立即成立组织，负责统一领导改良农具的试制、推广、生产、分配等。二、调整、充实和发展改良农具的制造修配组织，逐步形成全区的农具网。三、各地应当设置一个技术研究小组，巡回到现场进行技术指导。四、开展共产主义大协作，各地要主动交流经验和情况，相互支援、参观、访问，遇有重大问题可以全面合作去突破，使农具革新运动更加深入和广泛地开展起来。（附图片）
