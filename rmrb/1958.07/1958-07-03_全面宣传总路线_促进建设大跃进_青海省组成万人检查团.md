To thoroughly and comprehensively publicize the Party's General Line for socialist construction, to inspect and evaluate this year's work and the preparations for next year's work, and to promote the sustained Great Leap Forward in various construction undertakings, a ten-thousand-person inspection group headed by Comrade Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, set off on June 20 to conduct comprehensive inspections in industrial and mining areas and rural areas.

In addition to the responsible persons of Party organizations and relevant departments at the provincial, municipal, county, and township levels, the inspection group also included directors and branch secretaries of agricultural cooperatives. During the inspection, a systematic inspection will be carried out on current agricultural production issues, the production achievements of last winter and this spring, and the preparation work for next year's production. At the same time, the progress of local industrial construction, the mass technical revolution, the relationship between leaders and those being led in enterprises, and the various problems existing in rules and regulations will be inspected. In addition, inspections will also be carried out on financial and trade work, cultural and educational work, political and legal work, and the rectification movement.

The inspection method adopted is to dissect a sparrow—focusing on key inspections, grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, comprehensive analysis, universal evaluation, on-site inspection, on-site problem solving, and on-site summarization of experience.

At the inaugural meeting of the inspection group, Comrade Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, emphasized that the purpose of the inspection is to promote the development of various undertakings and to explore the positive factors in various tasks, so as to comprehensively implement the General Line for socialist construction, not specifically to find faults in the work. Through large-scale and comprehensive inspections, the General Line will be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, known to every household, raising awareness, and inspiring the two million people of the province to greater revolutionary zeal, and striving to build a prosperous Qinghai.

    全面宣传总路线　促进建设大跃进
    青海省组成万人检查团
    本报西宁电　为了深入地全面地宣传党的社会主义建设总路线，检查评比今年的各项工作和为明年工作的准备情况，促进各项建设事业持续地大跃进，以中共青海省委第一书记高峰同志为首的万人检查团已于6月20日出发，分别到工矿区、农村进行全面检查。
    检查团除省、市、县、乡的各级党组织和有关部门的负责人参加外，还吸收农业社的主任、支部书记参加。在检查中，对当前农业生产问题，去冬今春的生产成就以及明年生产的准备工作，都将进行系统检查。同时检查地方工业建设进展情况，群众性的技术革命情况，企业中的领导与被领导的关系，以及解决规章制度上存在的各种问题等。此外，对财经贸易工作、文化教育工作、政法工作，以及整风运动等也进行检查。
    检查的方法采取解剖一个麻雀——重点检查，抓两头带中间，全面分析，普遍评比，就地检查，就地解决问题，就地总结经验。
    在检查团成立大会上，省委第一书记高峰同志强调指出：检查的目的是促进各项事业的发展，发掘各项工作中的积极因素，以便全面地贯彻社会主义建设总路线，不是专找工作中的毛病。通过大规模地全面地检查，使总路线深入人心，家喻户晓，提高觉悟，鼓足全省二百万人民更大的革命干劲，为建设繁荣的青海而奋斗。
