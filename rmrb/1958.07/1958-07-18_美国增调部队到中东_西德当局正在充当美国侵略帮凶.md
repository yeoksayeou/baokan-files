Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: Washington dispatch: The United States is increasing troop deployment from Western Europe and its own country to Lebanon and the Middle East region.

The US Department of Defense announced on the 16th that the United States had airlifted 1,600 combat troops to Adana in southern Turkey, near the Syrian border, on the 16th. These troops were airlifted from West Germany to Turkey, most of them paratroopers, belonging to the 1st Airborne Battle Group of the 187th Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Division. It has now been placed under the command of newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of US Aggression Forces in Lebanon, Admiral James Holloway. The rest of the 24th Division is also in a state of readiness for action. According to US news agencies, the United States intends to transport a total of 11,000 troops from Western Europe to the Middle East, increasing the total strength of the US invasion force to 16,000.

At present, the US invasion force in Lebanon has a total strength of three battalions, 5,400 men. These three battalions are: the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the US Marine Corps, the 3rd Battalion of the 6th Regiment (which has already landed near Beirut) and the 1st Battalion of the 8th Regiment (preparing to land).

In addition to these three battalions, another unit of the 2nd Infantry Division of the Marine Corps took off from North Carolina, USA, on the 16th to reinforce the above three battalions in the Mediterranean region. The US Department of Defense declined to disclose the number of troops, but US news agencies estimate that the number is approximately equivalent to one battalion. At the same time, the US Department of Defense also announced late today that other units of the 2nd Infantry Division of the Marine Corps have also entered a so-called "pre-combat preparation exercise state."

According to Beirut news: After occupying the airport south of Beirut, the US intervention troops occupied the port of Beirut and the northern urban area on the morning of the 17th.

Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur Bonn dispatch on the 16th: The West German authorities are acting as accomplices to US imperialism's aggression against Lebanon and are attempting to find excuses for West Germany's participation in the imperialist aggression against the Middle East. The Bonn government already handed over the largest civilian airport in West Germany—the Rhine Airport near Frankfurt am Main—to the US occupation authorities on the evening of the 15th for use as a springboard for the US military's aggression against the Middle East.

Bonn political figures revealed that the West German government instructed its representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Permanent Council, Blankenhagen, on the 15th to provide "all possible assistance" to the US military.

The Bonn government's press office is trying hard to prove that the interests of so-called West German expatriates in the Middle East are being harmed, attempting to create an excuse for West Germany's participation in the crime of imperialist aggression against the Middle East.

    美国增调部队到中东
    西德当局正在充当美国侵略帮凶
    据新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：美国正在从西欧和本国增调军队到黎巴嫩和中东地区去。
    美国国防部16日宣布，美国在16日空运了一千六百人的作战部队到土耳其南部靠近叙利亚边境的亚达那。这些军队是从西德空运到土耳其的，其中大部分是伞兵，这支部队的番号是美军第二十四师一百八十七步兵团第一空运作战部队。它现在已拨归新任命的美国侵略黎巴嫩部队总司令、海军将军詹姆斯·霍洛威指挥。第二十四师的其余部分现在也已处于准备行动状态。据美国通讯社估计，美国一共打算从西欧运送一万一千人到中东而使美国侵略军的总兵力增加到一万六千人。
    目前美国在黎巴嫩的侵略军兵力共有三个营、五千四百人，这三个营是：美国海军陆战队第二步兵师的第二团第二营、第六团第三营
  （已经在贝鲁特附近登陆）和第八团第一营（正在准备登陆）。
    除了这三个营以外，海军陆战队第二步兵师的另一支部队已经在16日从美国北卡罗来纳州起飞，前往地中海地区增援上述三个营。美国国防部拒绝透露这支部队的人数，但是，据美国通讯社估计，这支部队的人数大约相等于一个营。同时，美国国防部今天晚间还宣布，海军陆战队第二步兵师的另一些部队也已进入所谓“战斗前准备演习状态”。
    另据贝鲁特消息：美国干涉军在占领了贝鲁特南面的机场以后，17日上午又占领了贝鲁特港口和北部城区。
    据新华社17日讯　据德意志通讯社波恩16日讯：西德当局充作美帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩的帮凶，并企图为西德参与帝国主义对中东的侵略寻找借口。波恩政府已经在15日晚间把西德最大的民用机场——美因河畔法兰克福市附近的莱因机场——拨给美国占领军当局使用，作为美军侵略中东的跳板。
    波恩政界人士透露，西德政府在15日曾指示它驻北大西洋集团常设理事会的代表布兰肯豪恩，要他向美国军队提供“一切可能的帮助”。
    波恩政府的新闻处极力想证明中东地区所谓西德侨民的利益受到了危害，企图为西德参加帝国主义侵略中东的罪行制造借口。
