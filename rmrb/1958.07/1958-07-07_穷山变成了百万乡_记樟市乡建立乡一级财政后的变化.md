Poor Mountain Becomes a Millionaire Township
——A Record of Changes in Zhangshi Township After Establishing Township-Level Finances
By Our Correspondent Chen Xiaojiang

	In the past two months, Zhangshi Township has undergone earth-shaking changes: forty-six factories for power generation, ironware, sawmills, oil pressing, flour milling, brick and tile making, fertilizer production, and processing and manufacturing are scattered throughout Zhangshi. Zhangshi Township has shaken off the backward and poor image of the mountain area that has existed for thousands of years.

	At the beginning of this year, Zhangshi Township, like many other villages across the country, planned to vigorously develop agricultural production, striving to achieve an average grain yield of 1,200 jin per mu throughout the township. The need to set up a set of factories to promote the development of agricultural production became apparent, but the source of funds became a serious problem.

	At that time, many cadres in the township requested the county to add to the budget, allocate technical personnel and construction materials. The Qujiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the principle of unified leadership and decentralized management and the spirit of the central government's implementation of the new financial system, clearly defined the scope of financial revenue and management between the county and the township, and devolved some financial power to the township, so that the township could be the master of its own finances, in order to better serve industrial and agricultural production. Zhangshi Township quickly established a township-level financial system. From then on, the six local taxes (slaughter tax, transaction tax, vehicle and vessel license tax, stamp tax, cultural and entertainment tax, and interest income tax) and various local incomes ("public property rent, market rent, deed tax, regulatory fees, tuition fees, self-raised funds for forestry, miscellaneous income, etc.) all became the township's fixed income. Subsequently, the county also allocated a portion of public bonds to the township, implementing profit-sharing with the township, and all self-raised grain in the township was used independently by the township. In terms of expenditure, all expenditures belonging to the township (including special funds allocated by the county) were included in the township-level budget. Once the township's budget was determined, it was subject to a contract responsibility system for revenue and expenditure, with all surplus revenue being arranged and used independently by the township, and any shortfall being resolved by the township through self-financing. This greatly increased the township's enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for managing finances. And it was determined that starting from production and increasing income on the basis of developing production was the only correct direction for the township's financial revenue.

	The establishment of township-level finance closely linked the township's financial revenue and expenditure with the interests of the local people. Therefore, it quickly gained the concern and support of the broad masses. After the township's three-year leap forward plan was discussed and debated among the masses, it quickly gained the support of the masses, and everyone put forward many guarantees and methods for achieving the plan. Immediately, the township formed a unified "joint cooperative" to arrange production, allocate labor, and technical forces to carry out diversified operations to organize fund income. The township's financial revenue and expenditure budget plan was also discussed and approved by the township People's Congress. After discussion, it was determined that this year's ways to increase income included developing mountain forests, burning bricks, tiles, and lime, distilling camphor oil, breeding fish fry, and other twenty-three items, increasing the township's total income by more than 6.6 million yuan. As a result, the township's financial revenue also jumped from more than 20,000 yuan last year (collected by the county) to more than 1.1 million yuan. In addition to production costs, expenses, dividends to agricultural cooperatives, and wage payments, most of these revenues are used for construction investments to realize the township's industrialization, mechanization, electrification, and transportation, cultural, educational, and health undertakings. Among them, industrial investment increased from the original 500,000 yuan to 1.25 million yuan. This year, the township will establish six power stations, two iron smelting plants, as well as fourteen factories urgently needed for the township's current production and construction, such as cement, joint processing, and agricultural tool repair. In addition, the township's more than 5,000 mu of fish ponds, 10,000 head cattle farms, pig farms, and chicken farms are all important aspects of financial revenue. In this way, in just over two months, the township's income has reached more than 360,000 yuan. Township finance is close to the masses, and the masses automatically build roads and theaters. For waste, they take the initiative to supervise, which is more conducive to doing financial work well. In the past, the ten lime kilns run by Zhangshi Township burned 600,000 jin of firewood every month. The masses quickly raised their opinions, believing that the waste was too great. The township took timely measures to merge the lime kilns into four and switch to burning coal, saving a large amount of expenses. All twenty-seven township cadres and seventy-five cooperative cadres are responsible for township financial work by department and region. In the past, tax collection work that could not be completed every month can now be cleared in two or three days. Zhangshi Township's local financial revenue from April to June this year increased by more than two times compared with the previous quarter. Among them, miscellaneous income was only 90.49 yuan for the whole year last year, while the income from April to June this year has reached more than 4,760 yuan. The situation where the state had to subsidize administrative expenses every year, and even the salaries of cadres could not be paid because the funds could not be transferred in time, will never happen again.

    穷山变成了百万乡
    ——记樟市乡建立乡一级财政后的变化
    本报记者  陈小江
    近两个月来，樟市乡掀起了翻天复地的变化：发电、铁器、锯木、榨油、磨面、砖瓦、肥料和加工制造等四十六个工厂，星罗棋布的摆满了樟市。樟市乡已经摆脱了数千年来山区落后和穷困的面貌。
    今年年初，樟市乡也和全国其他的许多乡村一样计划大搞农业生产，争取全乡粮食平均每亩达到一千二百斤；需要办一套工厂，促进农业生产的发展，但是资金来源就成为严重的困难问题。
    当时乡里不少干部要求县里给追加预算、调给技术人员和建设材料。中共曲江县委根据统一领导、分级管理的原则和中央实行新财政体制的精神，明确确定了县与乡的财政收入范围，管理范围，把财权下放一部分给乡，使乡在财政上实行当家作主，达到更好地为工农业生产服务的目的。樟市乡很快就建立了乡一级财政体制，从此，地方六税（屠宰税、交易税、车船牌照税、印花税、文化娱乐税、利息所得税）及地方各项收入（“公产租、市场租、契税、规费、学费、林木自筹、杂项收入等）全部成了乡的固定收入。接着，县又把一部分公债划给乡，实行与乡分成，乡的自筹粮也全部由乡自主使用。在支出方面，凡是属乡的支出（包括县拨的专款）全部由乡编入乡级预算内。乡的预算一经确定，实行收支包干，超收部分全部归乡自行安排使用，不超部分也由乡自筹解决。这样，就大大提高了乡管理财政的积极性和责任感。并且确定从生产入手，在发展生产的基础上增加收入，作为乡的财政收入唯一正确的方向。
    乡一级财政的建立，就使乡的财政收支和当地群众的利益发生了密切关系。因而也就很快地取得广大群众的关心和支持。该乡三年跃进规划拿到群众中讨论辩论后，很快就得到群众的支持，大家提出了许多实现规划的保证和办法。立即由乡组成一个统一安排生产、调配劳动、技术力量进行多种经营的“联社”来组织资金收入。乡的财政收支预算规划也经过乡人民代表大会的讨论和通过。经过讨论确定今年增加收入的门路，就有开发山林、烧砖瓦石灰、蒸樟油、繁殖鱼苗等二十三项，增加乡的总收入共达六百六十多万元，因而乡的财政收入也由去年（县收的）二万多元一跃达到一百一十多万元。这些收入除生产成本、费用、给农业社分红、支付工资外，绝大部分都用作实现乡工业化、机械化、电气化和交通运输、文教卫生事业等建设投资。其中工业投资就由原来的五十多万元增加到一百二十五万元。全乡今年内要建立六个发电站、两个炼铁厂以及水泥、联合加工、农具修配等为当前乡的生产建设迫切需要的十四个工厂。另外，全乡五千多亩鱼塘、万头牛场、猪场和鸡场都是财政收入的重要方面。这样，他们在短短两个多月的时间内，全乡的收入就已达到三十六万余元。乡财政接近群众，群众自动地兴修公路、剧院，对于浪费现象，就主动出来监督，更利于做好财政工作。樟市乡办的十个石灰窑过去每月就要烧去六十万斤木柴，群众很快就提出意见，认为浪费太大。乡及时采取措施，把石灰窑并成四个，改烧煤炭，节省了一大笔费用开支。全乡二十七个乡干部和七十五个社干部都分部门分地区包干乡财政工作。过去月月完不成计划的税收征收工作。现在两三天内就可以收清了。樟市乡今年4至6月的地方财政收入即比前一季度增多两倍以上，其中杂项收入去年全年只有九十元四角九分，而今年4至6月收入已达到四千七百六十多元。年年都要国家补贴行政费用，款项一时调不到，就连干部工资也无法发给的情况也再不会出现了。
