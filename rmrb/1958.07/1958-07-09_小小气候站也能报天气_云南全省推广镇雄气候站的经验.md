Small Climate Stations Can Also Report the Weather
Yunnan Province Promotes the Experience of the Zhenxiong Climate Station

(Our report) The Zhenxiong County Climate Station in Yunnan Province issues weather forecasts for the county that are both accurate and timely, playing a significant role in local agricultural production and receiving enthusiastic welcome from the masses.

In the past, meteorological observatories could generally only forecast weather for the area of the special district, and it was not very accurate when applied to specific counties and townships. However, the Zhenxiong County Climate Station's weather forecasts for the county from July to December last year achieved an average accuracy rate of 90% for rainfall predictions. During the rice transplanting season in July last year, there was a persistent drought with no rain. Just as a heavy rain was about to fall, the climate station promptly predicted the heavy rain and its amount. As a result, the masses dug wells and cleared ponds overnight to intercept and store rainwater, ensuring the transplanting of many paddy fields. The farmers in this county have come to regard listening to weather forecasts as an indispensable part of their daily lives.

This climate station has only two young staff members with secondary school education and short-term meteorological training, and very little equipment. They combine the large-scale weather patterns with local climatic rules. On one hand, they listen to the Kunming Meteorological Observatory's broadcasts, comparing and analyzing the predicted weather conditions for the special district and neighboring areas; on the other hand, they fully study the local weather patterns and carefully study the observation records before and after weather changes. They also attach great importance to the experience from the masses, collecting a large number of weather proverbs and verifying them. In this way, they quickly accumulated a set of data and initially grasped the rules of weather changes in Zhenxiong. Now, the experience of the Zhenxiong County Climate Station is being promoted throughout Yunnan Province.

    小小气候站也能报天气
    云南全省推广镇雄气候站的经验
    本报讯  云南省镇雄县气候站发布本县的天气预报，既准确又及时，对当地农业生产起很大作用，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。
    过去，气象台一般只能预报到专区范围的天气，具体应用到县、乡就不大准确。可是，镇雄县气候站从去年7月到12月发布的本县的天气预报，雨量预告的准确率平均达到90％。去年7月插秧时节，一直天旱无雨。这时正好要降一阵大雨，气候站及时预报了大雨和雨量，因此群众连夜挖井、清塘，拦蓄雨水，保证了许多水田插秧。这个县的农民已经把听天气预报当作日常不可缺少的生活内容。
    这个气候站只有两个中学程度、受过短期气象训练的青年工作人员，设备很少。他们把大范围的天气形势和地方的气候规律相结合，一面收听昆明气象台的广播，把预报本专区和邻近的天气情况加以比较分析；同时充分研究本地天气的规律，细心研究天气变化前后的观测记录。他们也非常重视来自群众的经验，搜集了大量天气谚语，加以验证。这样他们就很快积累了一套资料，初步掌握了镇雄天气变化的规律。现在，镇雄县气候站的经验已在云南全省推广。
