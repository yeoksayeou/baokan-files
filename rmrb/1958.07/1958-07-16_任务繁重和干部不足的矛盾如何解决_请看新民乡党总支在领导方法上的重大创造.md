How to Resolve the Contradiction Between Heavy Tasks and Insufficient Cadres
See the Major Innovation in Leadership Methods of the Xinmin Township Party General Branch

Editor's Note: The major innovation in leadership methods of the Xinmin Township Party General Branch in Pi County, introduced here, deserves the attention of all grassroots Party organizations. In order to solve the contradiction between heavy tasks and insufficient cadres in the Great Leap Forward, this township drew a batch of cadres from the whole township to form working groups and assign them to work in various cooperatives. In this way, the cooperatives did not lose a single cadre, but the township Party General Branch was equivalent to increasing a large number of cadres; the township Party General Branch did not send out a single one of its own cadres, but all cooperatives in the township were simultaneously directly supervised and helped by the township Party General Branch. The use of this leadership method also incidentally solved a series of other problems in practical work. This creation of Xinmin Township fully demonstrates that leadership is an art. It is hoped that grassroots Party organizations in various places can learn from the bold and original spirit of the Xinmin Township Party General Branch in Pi County, adapt to their own conditions, and further improve leadership methods and working methods.

(Our dispatch) This reporter, Ma Peiwen, reports: The Xinmin Township Party General Branch of Pi County, Sichuan Province, carrying forward the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, boldly created a new leadership method, solved the contradiction between heavy work tasks and insufficient cadres in the Great Leap Forward, and greatly strengthened the specific leadership of grassroots Party organizations over cooperatives.

How to solve the contradiction between heavy tasks and insufficient cadres? This has long been a source of distress for Xinmin Township, Pi County.

The all-round leap forward in rural work has made cooperatives increasingly in need of grassroots Party organizations to strengthen specific leadership and specific assistance, and therefore grassroots Party organizations have increasingly felt that their strength is insufficient. This is a fairly common contradiction. The Xinmin Township Party General Branch in Pi County has been troubled by this contradiction for a long time.

In June, this contradiction became even more acute. Township local industries were about to be established, and the county's financial and commercial work was decided to be decentralized. The township Party General Branch had to assign full-time personnel to manage these tasks, and the leadership force felt even more inadequate. The serious problem was still agricultural production. At that time, after the county party committee inspection team inspected, there were many problems in agricultural production that urgently needed to be solved: such as the problem of accumulating and making fertilizer, the problem of topdressing middle rice, the problem of eliminating third-class seedlings, the problem of sparse seedlings and dense replanting, the problem of rushing to plant sweet potatoes, the problem of strengthening field management, etc. These farm works were also extremely seasonal, and if they could not be grasped immediately, the target of double thousand catties per mu would be in danger of failing. Moreover, the more serious problem was that many commune members and even some team cadres had conservative or relaxed thoughts, and the production of some communes was particularly backward, and there was a great imbalance in production throughout the township. This situation required the township Party General Branch to adopt new leadership methods to comprehensively grasp the production of all cooperatives and to provide specific guidance and specific assistance to more cooperatives.

Drawing a batch of cadres from each cooperative to form working groups and send them to other cooperatives.

Where did the cadres come from? Rely on the superior to solve it? Impossible. Rely on your own cadres to solve it? Also impossible. What to do? The Xinmin Township Party General Branch finally boldly created a working method and brilliantly solved the contradiction that had long troubled them.

This working method is to draw twenty-two cooperative directors or deputy directors from the twenty-two cooperatives in the township, and draw one hundred and seven team leaders or deputy team leaders from the one hundred and seven production teams in the township, to form twenty-two working groups representing the township Party General Branch. Roughly following the principle of advanced helping backward and backward learning from advanced, they were sent to cooperatives other than their own. Each team had to have members of the working group participating in labor, and the number of cadres drawn from each commune was equal to the number of cadres sent to the working group. The policy was to inspect each other, help each other, learn from each other, and promote each other. The specific tasks were: 1. Accumulate, make, and apply fertilizer; 2. Replenish seedlings to make all seedlings strong; 3. Strengthen field management; 4. Control rice stem borers; 5. Rush to plant sweet potatoes. The working time was ten days. On June 21, each working group started working in each cooperative simultaneously. Although the time was only ten days, the effect was very significant. A total of more than 3,100 mu of topdressing, 251 mu of replanting, 78 mu of missing seedlings, 1,100 mu of third-class seedlings were eliminated, and more than 1,100 mu of sweet potatoes were planted in a rush. The main weak links in the township's production were all strengthened, and they completely caught up with the season. The production outlook of each commune has changed, especially the five communes with particularly backward production, and the changes are even more significant.

This is a working method that is more, faster, better, and more economical. Township cadres do not increase, but their enthusiasm greatly increases.

Perhaps some people do not understand: The number of cadres in the cooperative has not increased, but only some people have been transferred. Why does it produce such a big effect? The key to the problem lies in this "transfer." This is no small "transfer." It further "mobilized" the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. First, look at the working group. Its members are no longer cadres of the cooperative, but cadres sent by the township Party General Branch to inspect and help another cooperative. Their working policy is very clear, and their working tasks are very specific, which greatly strengthens the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of the working group cadres. Some cadres who were relatively passive and slack in their own work have become particularly conscientious and responsible as soon as they joined the working group, which is a good proof. Then look at the cadres of the cooperative. With the working group, it is a great spur to them. The cadres who were already enthusiastic will be even more enthusiastic, and the cadres who were not enthusiastic enough will have to cheer up. Especially those cadres who are bound by the backward and conservative habitual forces from relatives, neighbors, friends, etc., and cannot handle things according to principles, dare to break the affection and resolutely carry out the task under the supervision, help, and support of the working group. All the cadres of the Xinmin Township Cooperative have a particularly deep understanding of this point. Finally, look at the members of the cooperative. As soon as the working group arrives at the cooperative, the positive factors in the members increase. Under the encouragement and support of the working group, most members want to run the commune well or run the commune better. The negative factors are reduced. The members who used to like to spread conservative and backward air have restrained themselves. The members who used to not work or not work much also often work. Many cooperatives have appeared with the scene of weeding rice seedlings in the rain and accumulating fertilizer by lighting. The attendance rate of all cooperatives has generally increased on the basis of the original 90%.

The three forces of the working group, cooperative cadres, and cooperative members converge to become a huge torrent to promote production and improve work. All of these are the result of "transferring."

Let the advanced help the backward and the backward learn from the advanced. This working method is the most practical and effective.

The promoting role of the working group on work is not only reflected in the outstanding production achievements, but also in helping those relatively backward communes to improve their leadership methods and leadership style. For example, after the Third Commune Working Group arrived at the Fifteenth Commune, they found that the commune lacked sweet potato vines and could not complete the sweet potato planting task. They also found that some members were planting sweet potatoes in their private plots and even selling the sweet potato vines that they could not use to other communes at high prices. The working group helped the team cadres organize a great debate on the collective interests of the team and the individual interests of the members. After the debate, the members immediately stopped selling to the outside and planting sweet potatoes in their private plots, and sold the sweet potato vines to the team at a reasonable price, completely solving the needs of the team for sweet potato vines. This matter greatly educated the team cadres, making them understand how to resolutely and correctly handle the relationship between the collective and the individual, and how to conduct ideological education for the members using the mass line method.

The working group not only has the task of inspecting work and helping work, but also has the task of learning. Especially for those working groups from communes with relatively backward work, it is an excellent learning opportunity. For example, the Nineteenth Commune is a relatively backward commune. In the process of working in the Eleventh Commune, the director of the commune, Wu Shiming, felt that the biggest characteristic of this commune was that the leading cadres were good at doing ideological work and good at following the mass line. One thing impressed him particularly deeply: On the second day of his work, the commune began to plant late rice. On the same day, the commune cadres carefully measured the planted seedlings with a ruler, and held a commune member meeting in the evening for evaluation. The commune management committee praised the members who planted completely according to the specifications and criticized the individual members who did not meet the specifications. At the same time, everyone should calculate an account: If everyone is careless, and plants one or two nests less in each row, how much grain will be harvested less per mu? How much grain will the whole team harvest less? Is it better to plant strictly according to the standard? Or does it not matter if you are careless? Let the members start a debate.

After ten days of work and study, Wu Shiming deeply realized the importance of doing ideological work and following the mass line, and learned some methods of doing ideological work and following the mass line.

The experience of Xinmin Township tells us that this method of letting advanced communes lead backward communes and letting backward communes learn from advanced communes is the most practical and effective method. Of course, organizing visits and evaluations and participating in on-site meetings can also promote and learn advanced experiences. But the latter is only watching, while the former not only watches, but also does, which will greatly increase the effect of watching and increase the talent of applying advanced experience. The cadres of the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Communes have not heard others introduce methods of doing ideological work and following the mass line, but they have not learned as deeply and practically as they have learned in these ten days. It can be believed that as long as these cadres go through such practical learning and training several times, their leadership level will be greatly improved.

Backward communes also have advanced experiences that can be learned. Advanced communes also have serious shortcomings that can be checked.

So, does it mean that the cadres of advanced communes can only help with work when they go to backward communes, and there is nothing to learn? The experience of Xinmin Township proves that this is not the case. For example, the Third Commune is an advanced commune in this township. After the director of the commune, Yang Huixuan, went to the relatively backward Fifteenth Commune to work, on the one hand, he helped the commune discover and solve many problems, and felt that the work of the commune was far behind his own commune in many aspects; on the other hand, he also found that the work of developing pigs in the Fifteenth Commune was far ahead of his own commune. The commune has a deputy director who specializes in developing pigs and implements a system of public ownership and private feeding. As soon as the members' sows give birth to piglets, the deputy director will arrange which members will raise these piglets in the future, so the development of pigs is faster. Yang Huixuan said that the Third Commune must learn from the Fifteenth Commune and establish a system for the responsible management of pig development. This shows that any cooperative, as long as it is not in the hands of anti-socialist elements, even if its work is relatively backward, there will always be some advanced factors. It is not in line with the actual situation to regard backward units as all bad, but a one-sided view.

One of the meanings of "mutual learning" between various cooperatives lies here. So, does it mean that the cadres of backward communes go to advanced communes, mainly to learn, and cannot help advanced communes in any way? The experience of Xinmin Township proves that this is not the case.

For example, the Thirteenth Commune is a commune with relatively poor work. The director of this commune, Huang Guoan, led the working group to work in the relatively advanced Third Commune. On the one hand, they did learn a lot of advanced experience; on the other hand, they also discovered and helped the commune solve a major problem. When Huang Guoan inspected the early rice seedlings, he carefully calculated the area of the early rice planting, and carefully measured the early rice seedbeds. As a result, he found that the seedlings were short of fourteen mu according to the dense planting specifications. He immediately investigated and found that the production team leader in charge of raising seedlings had a resistance to dense planting and deliberately raised fewer seedlings. The commune management committee had inspected the early rice seedling raising, but only believed the false report below and did not have an in-depth understanding. Huang Guoan criticized the wrong behavior of opposing dense planting and making false reports on the one hand, and actively transferred seedlings from other communes on the other hand, so that production was not affected. This shows that any advanced unit will have some backward factors. It is not in line with the actual situation to regard advanced units as all good. It is also a one-sided view. One of the meanings of "mutual help" between various cooperatives lies here.

Rotating inspections of cooperatives in the intermediate state can also help and learn from each other.

Under normal circumstances, cooperatives in the intermediate state always account for a relatively large majority. Can rotating inspections between these cooperatives also help and learn from each other? The experience of Xinmin Township gave a positive answer. Because differences are the common characteristics of the development of all things. The same type of cooperatives in the intermediate type cannot have the same advantages and the same disadvantages. Always in some problems, one cooperative handles it well, another cooperative handles it poorly, one cooperative is advanced in this work, and another cooperative is leading in that work. For example, the Twenty-eighth and Fifth Communes in Xinmin Township are two intermediate-type cooperatives. The Twenty-eighth Commune grasped the season early, and the middle rice has been hoeed for the first time. When the working group of this commune arrived at the Fifth Commune, they found that the 80 mu of middle rice in the Fifth Commune had not been hoeed yet. They immediately mobilized the members to hoe the middle rice once, ensuring the faster growth of the middle rice. The work of opening graveyards to expand arable land in the Fifth Commune was done well. When the Fifth Commune working group came to the Twenty-eighth Commune, they found that the graveyard in the Twenty-eighth Commune had not been moved yet. They immediately mobilized the members to open the graveyard and expanded the arable land by five mu.

Breaking the superstition that only superiors can inspect the work of subordinates. Mutual inspection between cooperatives also has its advantages.

Perhaps some people think: Only superiors can inspect the work of subordinates. How can one cooperative inspect the work of another cooperative? The experience of Xinmin Township proves that this "thought" is also a superstition and has broken this superstition with its own inspection results. In fact, as long as this inspection is organized and led, then not only can it be inspected, but also this inspection has greater advantages than the inspection of superiors in some aspects. Because: First, the members of the working group are either the director of the commune or the production team leader. They are all "experts" in the operation and management and production technology of the commune. They will find some problems in these aspects more easily than their superiors; second, the members of the working group work and live with the members, and have a very close relationship with the members. They also know the situation in the commune better. Some problems that superiors find very difficult or even impossible to find, they may find. They found twelve such problems in ten days. Third, the working group is not only to inspect the work, but also to help the work. As long as they find any problems, they will immediately lead the members and solve them with the members. It is more efficient than relying on cooperatives to solve problems found in the inspection by superiors. Therefore, this inspection can never be completely replaced by the inspection of superiors, just as this inspection cannot replace the inspection of superiors. The praise of the working group by the masses of all cooperatives: "The local working team is really fierce!" is a very good explanation of the great advantages of this inspection.

After preliminary summary, the Xinmin Township Party General Branch has included this working method into the leadership strengthening system. The second batch of working groups, which lasted for ten days, started working again on the 5th of this month.

The Pi County Party Committee has also begun to promote this working method in all townships throughout the county.

    任务繁重和干部不足的矛盾如何解决
    请看新民乡党总支在领导方法上的重大创造
    编者按：这里介绍的中共郫县新民乡总支委员会领导方法的重大创造，值得引起一切基层党组织的注意。这个乡为了解决大跃进中任务繁重和干部不足的矛盾，从全乡抽调一批干部组成工作组分到各合作社工作。这样，合作社没有减少一个干部，乡总支却等于增加了大批干部；乡总支没有派出自己的一个干部，全乡所有合作社却等于同时直接受到了乡总支的监督和帮助。运用这种领导方法还附带解决了实际工作中的其他一系列问题。新民乡的这一创造，充分显示了领导是一种艺术。希望各地基层党组织都能学习中共郫县新民乡总支委员会这种大胆独创的精神，适应自己的情况，进一步改进领导方法和工作方法。
    本报讯　记者马沛文报道：中共四川省郫县新民乡总支委员会，发扬敢想敢干的精神，大胆创造了一种新的领导方法，解决了大跃进中工作任务繁重和干部不足的矛盾，大大加强了党的基层组织对合作社的具体领导。
    如何解决任务繁重和干部不足的矛盾这是郫县新民乡长期以来存在的苦恼
    农村工作的全面跃进，使合作社愈来愈需要党的基层组织加强具体领导和具体帮助，因此党的基层组织也就愈来愈感到力量不够。这是一个带有相当普遍性的矛盾。中共郫县新民乡总支委员会一直被这个矛盾苦恼着。
    6月间，这个矛盾更加尖锐起来。乡的地方工业要着手兴办，县的财政工作和商业工作决定下放，这些工作乡总支必须抽出专人来管理，领导力量就更感不足了。严重的问题还是农业生产，当时，县委检查团检查以后，农业生产中有很多问题亟待解决：如积肥造肥问题，中稻追肥问题，消灭三类苗问题，稀秧补密问题，抢栽红苕问题，加强田间管理问题等等，这些农活又带着极大的季节性，要是不能马上抓起来，争取亩产双千斤的指标就有落空的危险。而且，更严重的问题还在于不少社员甚至部分社干部有保守思想或松劲思想，还有一些社的生产特别落后，全乡在生产上存在着很大的不平衡状况。这种情况要求乡总支必须采取新的领导方法，把所有的合作社的生产全面地抓起来，而且要对更多的合作社作具体指导和具体帮助。
    从每个合作社抽调一批干部组成工作组派到别的合作社去
    干部哪里来呢？靠上级解决吗？不可能。靠自己的干部解决吗？也不可能。怎么办呢？新民乡总支终于大胆地创造了一种工作方法，出色地解决了长期苦恼着他们的矛盾。
    这种工作方法就是从全乡二十二个合作社中抽调二十二个社长或副社长，从全乡一百零七个生产队中，抽调一百零七个队长或副队长，组成二十二个代表乡总支的工作组，大体上按照先进帮助落后，落后学习先进的原则，分别派到本社以外的合作社中去，每个队都要有工作组的成员参加劳动，每个社抽调出来的干部同派去的工作组的干部数量相等。方针是互相检查、互相帮助、互相学习、互相促进。具体任务是：一积肥造肥下肥；二补苗全苗壮苗；三加强田间管理；四治稻螟虫；五抢栽红苕。工作时间是十天。6月21日，各个工作组到各个合作社同时开始工作。时间虽仅仅十天，效果却十分显著。总计全乡追肥三千一百多亩，补秧二百五十一亩，解决缺秧七十八亩，消灭三类苗一千一百多亩，抢栽红苕一千一百多亩。使全乡生产上主要的薄弱环节全部加强起来，完全赶上了季节。每个社的生产面貌都有了改变，尤其是五个生产上特别落后的社，变化更加显著。
    这是一种多快好省的工作方法乡干部不增加　干劲大增加
    也许有人不明白：合作社的干部一个也没有增加，只不过把一些人调动了一下，为何就会产生这样大的作用呢？问题的关键就在于这个“调动了一下”。这是一种非同小可的“调动”，它把干部和群众的积极性进一步“调动”起来了。先看工作组，它的成员已经不是合作社的干部，而是由乡总支派来检查和帮助另一个合作社工作的干部了。他们的工作方针非常明确，工作任务非常具体，这就大大加强了工作组干部的责任心和积极性，一些在本社工作中比较消极疲沓的干部，一参加工作组就格外认真负责起来，便是很好的证明。再看合作社的干部，有了工作组，对他们是一个很大的鞭策，原来干劲就足的干部，干劲会更足，原来干劲不足的干部，也得鼓足起来。特别是那些受到来自亲属、邻舍、朋友等等方面落后保守的习惯势力的束缚，不能按照原则办事的干部，在工作组的监督、帮助和支持之下敢于破除情面，坚决执行任务了。新民乡合作社的全体干部对这一点体会得特别深。最后看合作社社员，工作组一到合作社，社员中积极的因素就增长了，多数社员在工作组的鼓励和支持之下，要把社办好或者把社办得更好。而消极的因素减少了，过去喜欢散布保守落后空气的社员收敛起来了，过去不出工或者不大出工的社员也经常出工了。很多合作社出现了冒雨薅秧、挑灯积肥的景象，所有合作社的出勤率在原来的90％的基础上普遍又有增加。
    工作组、合作社干部、合作社社员这三股力量汇合在一起，就成了促进生产、改进工作的一条巨流，而这些都是因为“调动了一下”的结果。
    让先进帮落后落后学先进这种工作方法最切实最有效
    工作组对工作的促进作用，不仅表现在突出的生产成就上，也表现在帮助那些比较落后的社改进领导方法和领导作风上。例如三社工作组到十五社以后，发现社里缺红苕藤，不能完成红苕栽种任务，又发现有些社员却在自留地里栽种红苕，甚至把用不了的红苕藤高价向社外出售。工作组就帮助这个社的社干部组织了社的集体利益和社员的个体利益的大辩论，经过辩论，社员立即停止了向外出售和在自留地里栽种红苕，把红苕藤按合理的价格卖给社里，全部解决了社里红苕藤的需要问题。这件事对社干部的教育很大，使他们懂得了应该如何坚决地、正确地处理集体和个体的关系，如何用群众路线的方法对社员进行思想教育。
    工作组不但有检查工作和帮助工作的任务，也有学习的任务。特别是那些来自工作比较落后的社的工作组，更是一个极好的学习机会。例如十九社是个比较落后的社，社长吴世明到十一社工作的过程中，感到这个社的最大特点是领导干部善于作思想工作和善于走群众路线。有一件事对他的印象特别深刻：他参加工作的第二天，社里开始栽晚稻。当天，社干部用尺把栽好的秧苗作了仔细丈量，晚上就开社员大会进行评比。社管委会对那些栽的完全合乎规格的社员作了表扬，对个别不合规格的社员作了批评。同时，要大家算一笔账：如果大家都马虎一点，每排少栽一窝到两窝，每亩要少收多少粮食？全社要少收多少粮食？究竟是严格按标准栽好呢？还是马虎一点没关系呢？让社员展开辩论。
    经过十天的工作和学习，吴世明深刻地体会到作思想工作和走群众路线的重要，并学习到作思想工作和走群众路线的一些方法。
    新民乡的经验告诉我们：用这种方法让先进社带动落后社，让落后社学习先进社，是最实际也最有效的方法。当然，组织参观评比、参加现场会议，同样可以推广和学习先进经验。但是后者仅仅是看，前者不仅看，还要干，这就会大大增加看的效果和增长运用先进经验的才干。十五社和十九社的干部，并不是没有听过别人介绍作思想工作和走群众路线的方法，但却远远没有在这十天中学到的这样深刻和切实。可以相信，只要经过这样几次实际的学习和锻炼，这些干部的领导水平是会大大提高的。
    落后社也有可学习的先进经验  先进社也有可检查的严重缺点
    那么，是不是说先进社的干部到后进社去只能是帮助工作，就无可学习的呢？新民乡的经验证明，并非如此。例如三社是这个乡的先进社，社长杨惠轩到工作比较落后的第十五社以后，一方面帮助这个社发现和解决了很多问题，感到这个社的工作在很多方面都落在自己社的后面；但是，另一方面，也发现了十五社发展生猪的工作却远远地跑在自己社的前面了。这个社有一个副社长专管发展生猪，并且实行公有私喂的制度。社员的母猪一生猪仔，副社长就把这些猪仔将来由哪些社员喂养作了安排，因此生猪发展较快。杨惠轩表示，三社一定要学习十五社，建立专责管理生猪发展的制度。这说明任何合作社，只要不是掌握在反社会主义分子的手里，即使它的工作比较落后，总会有些先进的因素。把落后单位看得一切都糟，绝不符合实际情况，而是一种片面观点。
    所谓各个合作社之间“互相学习”的意义之一就在这里。那么，是不是后进社的干部到先进社去，主要是学习，就不可能对帮助先进社有所作为呢？新民乡的经验证明，也并非如此。
    例如十三社是个工作比较差的社，这个社的社长黄国安带领的工作组到比较先进的三社去工作。一方面，他们的确学到了不少的先进经验，另一方面，他们也发现并且帮助这个社解决了一个重大问题。黄国安在检查早稻秧苗的时候，仔细地计算了早稻栽秧面积，又仔细地丈量了早稻秧母田，结果发现按照密植规格秧苗要缺十四亩之多。他就立即加以追究，原来是负责育秧的生产组长对密植有抵触情绪，故意少育了秧。社管委会曾对早稻育秧作过检查，但只相信了下面的虚假报告并未深入了解。黄国安一方面批评了这种反对密植和作假报告的错误行为，一方面就积极向别的社调剂秧苗，使生产没有受到影响。这说明任何先进的单位，都会有一些落后因素，把先进单位看得一切都好，也不符合实际情况，同样是一种片面观点。所谓各个合作社“互相帮助”的意义之一就在这里。
    中间状态的合作社轮换检查也可以互相帮助互相学习
    在通常情况下，处于中间状态的合作社，总是占比较的多数。在这些合作社之间轮换检查，是否也可以互相帮助，互相学习呢？新民乡的经验作了肯定的答复。因为千差万别是一切事物发展的共同特点。同样是中间类型的合作社，也不可能优点相同缺点也相同。总会在某些问题上，一个合作社处理得好，另一个合作社处理得差，一个合作社在这一项工作上先进，另一个合作社在那一项工作上领先。例如新民乡的二十八社和五社是两个中间类型的合作社。二十八社季节抓得早，中稻已薅过第一次，当这个社的工作组到了五社时，发现五社的八十亩中稻还未薅过，马上就发动社员把中稻薅了一遍，保证了中稻的更快生长。而五社开辟坟园扩大耕地的工作作得好，当五社工作组来到二十八社时，发现二十八社的坟园仍然未动，就立即发动社员把坟园开了，扩大了五亩耕地面积。
    打破只有上级才能检查下级工作的迷信  合作社之间互相检查也有它的优越性
    也许有人认为：只有上级才能检查下级的工作，一个合作社如何能够检查另一个合作社的工作呢？新民乡的经验证明这种“认为”也是一种迷信，并且用自己检查的效果打破了这种迷信。实际上，只要这种检查是有组织有领导的，那么，不仅能够检查，而且这种检查在某些方面比上级的检查还要具有更大的优越性。因为：第一、工作组的成员不是社长就是生产队长，他们都是社的经营管理和生产技术上的“里手”，这些方面存在的某些问题，他们会比上级更容易发现；第二、工作组的成员同社员一起劳动，一起生活，同社员的关系非常密切，对社里的情况也比较了解。有些上级很难发现甚至不能发现的问题，他们就可能发现。这样的问题，他们在十天内就发现了十二个。三、工作组不仅是检查工作，同时还要帮助工作，只要发现什么问题，他们就马上领导社员并同社员一起加以解决，雷厉风行，立见成效，这就比上级在检查中发现了问题依靠合作社去解决的效率要高得多。因此，这种检查绝不是上级的检查所能完全代替，正同这种检查也不能代替上级的检查一样。所有合作社的群众对工作组的一片赞扬之声：“土工作队真凶！”就是这种检查具有很大优越性的很好说明。
    新民乡总支经过初步总结，已把这种工作方法列入加强领导的制度之中。为期十天的第二批工作组在本月5日又开始工作。
    郫县县委会也已经开始在全县所有的乡普遍推行这种工作方法了。
