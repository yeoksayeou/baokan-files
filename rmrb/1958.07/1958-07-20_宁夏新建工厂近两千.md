    Nearly Two Thousand New Factories in Ningxia

    Yinchuan Dispatch from our newspaper, July 19th. Under the glorious illumination of the general line of socialist construction, local industries in the Ningxia region are rapidly advancing. From March of this year to the present, nearly two thousand factories have been established throughout the autonomous region, with over one thousand four hundred already officially in production.

    These factories encompass nine categories, including electricity, coal, non-ferrous metal smelting, chemical industry, metal manufacturing, fuel processing, food, textiles, and building materials; factories producing means of production account for approximately 50%. Among these factories, over six hundred and sixty are operated by special districts and counties, with the remainder operated by townships and agricultural cooperatives. Small-scale coal mines are being constructed in all nineteen counties (cities) of the region. Most townships now have agricultural implement repair factories. Eight counties have established indigenous iron smelting plants. The indigenous iron smelting plants built in Zhongning and Pingluo counties have already smelted over ten thousand catties of iron.

    The backbone industries operated by the autonomous region are developing by leaps and bounds. There are thirteen factories that have already begun construction or are about to begin construction. These include: a joint iron and steel plant with an annual output of 95,000 tons of iron, 50,000 to 100,000 tons of steel, and 43,000 tons of steel materials; a nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 2,000 tons of synthetic ammonia; a 10,000-spindle flax textile factory; and a sugar factory with a daily processing capacity of 1,000 tons of sugar beets, etc. The existing Yinchuan Power Plant, Wool Textile Factory, Automobile Repair Factory, Shizuishan Porcelain Factory, Ruqigou Coal Mine, etc., are also being expanded or renovated.

    The industrial foundation of the Ningxia region is very weak. As of 1957, there were only thirty-one factories and mines in the entire autonomous region, and they were small in scale, with limited accumulation, outdated equipment, and mostly manual operations. The total industrial output value of the region accounted for only 9.6% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. There were only eight engineers in the entire region, most of whom were promoted in 1956. When the large-scale development of local industries began, many cadres had feelings of inferiority, believing that the Ningxia region was backward and unable to develop local industries on a large scale. The Working Committee of the CPC Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region criticized these views, demanding the liberation of thought and the bold development of industry. Party committees at all levels took personal command, with the First Secretary taking charge and grasping the development of industry. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry of Light Industry also sent working groups to provide support for the planning and design of many important factories.

    In the process of developing industries, various localities mobilized people of all ethnic groups, solved the current problems of technical strength and funding, and discovered more than 1,000 mineral deposits, leading to a popular upsurge in the development of industry by the whole people. Recently, the CPC Ningxia Working Committee has put forward a plan to further develop local industries on a large scale and is actively preparing for an even larger-scale leap forward next year. It is estimated that by 1962, the total industrial output value of the Ningxia region will greatly exceed the total agricultural output value.

### 宁夏新建工厂近两千

    宁夏新建工厂近两千
    本报银川19日电　宁夏地区的地方工业在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，正在快马加鞭，突飞猛进。从今年3月到目前，全自治区已经办起将近两千个工厂，其中有一千四百多个已经正式投入生产。
    这些工厂包括电力、煤炭、有色金属冶炼、化学工业、金属制造、燃料加工、食品、纺织、建筑材料等九类；生产生产资料的工厂约占50％。这些工厂中，专区和县办的有六百六十多个，其余是乡和农业社办的。小型煤矿也在全区十九个县（市）兴建起来。大多数乡都有了农具修配厂。八个县办起了土法炼铁厂。中宁、平罗两个县建成的土法炼铁厂，已经炼铁一万多斤。
    自治区办的骨干工业在飞跃发展。现在已经开始建设和即将开始建设的工厂有十三个。其中包括：年产九万五千吨铁、五到十万吨钢、四万三千吨钢材的联合钢铁厂，年产两千吨合成氨的氮肥厂，一万绽的亚麻纺织厂，日处理甜菜一千吨的糖厂等。原有的银川电厂、毛纺织厂、汽车修配厂、石嘴山瓷厂、汝箕沟煤矿等，也在扩建或改建。
    宁夏地区的工业基础非常薄弱。截至1957年，全自治区只有三十一个厂矿，而且规模小，积累少，设备陈旧，多半是手工操作。全区工业总产值仅占工农业总产值的9.6％。全区只有八个工程师，大部分是1956年提拔起来的。开始大办地方工业的时候，不少干部思想上存在着自卑心理，认为宁夏地区落后，无法大规模举办地方工业。中共宁夏回族自治区工作委员会批判了这些看法，要求解放思想，大胆发展工业。各级党委都由第一书记亲自挂帅，把办工业抓了起来。冶金工业部、建筑工程部、化学工业部、轻工业部，也派来工作组，对许多重要工厂的规划设计进行了支援。
    各地在办工业的过程中，发动各族人民，解决了当前技术力量、资金等方面的问题，并且发现矿点一千多处，普遍出现了全民办工业的热潮。最近，中共宁夏工委又提出了进一步大办地方工业的计划，并在为明年更大规模的跃进积极进行准备。预计到1962年，宁夏地区的工业总产值将大大超过农业总产值。
