    Don't Let Them Block the Way
    A Group of Students Returned from the Soviet Union

    After reading the article "Who Dares to Block the Way" published in the People's Daily on June 19th, we were very indignant. At a time when communist spirit is flourishing everywhere in the motherland, there are still people hiding in corners whispering, and these whispers can even temporarily block the path of a talented scientific researcher from entering a research institution. This is intolerable. The reason why it is intolerable is because it is probably blocking the path of more than one person. Comrade Li Shimei is precisely our vanguard. In the era when the motherland is entering the Great Cultural Revolution, who knows how many more Li Shimeis will appear. If these advanced workers cannot be justifiably absorbed by scientific research institutions, what kind of Cultural Revolution is this? Scientific research institutions are one of our positions for advancing towards science and technology. If anyone wants to turn them into temples or palaces, this is something we cannot agree to. Anyone who has recognized the direction and mastered the weapons must stand on the position. This is the need of the people and the trend of the times. Any whispering or blind discrimination is of no avail. What should be reminded to these people is: We have the right to disregard anyone who unreasonably discriminates against the inventions and creations of the working people. Because regardless of the size of these people's achievements, at least they have reversed the position of the working people and themselves. If people who call themselves scientists cannot even understand this kind of reasoning, and instead repeatedly say that this cannot be considered scientific work and that cannot be considered scientific research, then what kind of people's scientific workers are they?
    One of the main tasks of the Cultural Revolution is to cultivate new intellectuals, transform old intellectuals, and build a contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals. To cultivate such a magnificent contingent, it is necessary to create conditions in all aspects: both cultivate them in practical work, and also cultivate them in universities, and also study abroad to absorb other people's strengths, and also enable these people to play a role in scientific research institutions and continue to study in depth. Now is the time when a large number of advanced scientific workers are emerging from the working masses. If there really is anyone who dares to unreasonably block the way, we must shout loudly at them: "Don't block the way!" So that he can wake up and turn around to advance with us.
    We were just about to send our opinions to the motherland when we received new newspapers saying that Comrade Li Shimei has been hired as a professor by Sun Yat-sen University. We cheer for Sun Yat-sen University: "You did the right thing!"

    不许他们挡道
    一班留苏同学
    看到了6月19日人民日报刊载的“谁敢挡道”这篇文章以后，我们很愤慨。在祖国正是共产主义精神到处蓬勃发展的时候，竟然还有人躲在角落里窃窃私议，而且这私议居然还能够暂时地塞住一个有才能的科学研究者进入研究机关的道路，这是令人不能容忍的。其所以不能令人容忍，是因为它塞住的恐怕并不止一个人的道路。李始美同志正是我们的先锋，在祖国进入文化大革命的时代，说不定还要出现多少个李始美。如果这些先进工作者不能够理直气壮地被科学研究机关吸收，那还叫什么文化大革命？科学研究机关是我们向科学技术大进军的阵地之一，如果有人想把它变成庙堂或宫殿一类的东西，这是我们所不能答应的。凡是认清了方向、掌握了武器的人就必须站到阵地上，这是人民的需要，大势之所趋。任何窃窃私议或盲目歧视都无济于事。值得提醒这些人的倒是：任何毫无道理歧视劳动人民的发明创造的人，我们都有权利不把他放在眼里。因为姑不论这些人的成就大小如何，起码他是把劳动人民和他自己的位置放颠倒了。如果自命为科学家的人连这样的道理都弄不清，反而口口声声说这也不能算科学工作者，那也不能算为科学研究，那还算什么人民的科学工作者？
    文化革命的主要任务之一就是要培养新知识分子，改造旧知识分子，建立一支成千万人的工人阶级的知识分子队伍。要培养这样一支气势磅礴的队伍就需要从各方面创造条件：既在实际工作中培养，也在高等学校培养，也要留学以吸取别人的长处，也要使这些人能在科学研究机关发挥作用和继续深造。现在是劳动群众中间涌现出来的大批先进科学工作者的时候，如果当真有谁敢于不讲道理挡住去路，我们就要向他们大喝一声说：“不许挡道！”以使他清醒过来回身和我们一道前进。
    我们刚要把我们的意见寄向祖国，就接到了新报纸说：李始美同志已被中山大学聘为教授。我们向中山大学欢呼：“你们作得对！”
