    How to Prevent Gas Stove Explosions?
    Our First Automobile Works has manufactured a large number of gas engines to support rural areas. However, it has been discovered that the CA4 gas generator's filter lacks safety devices. Careless use can lead to filter explosions, causing minor damage to the machinery or serious accidents. To avoid accidents, I propose the following preventive measures:
    One, when cleaning the furnace after using the gas engine, first open the filter caps of the three furnaces and wait for the gas inside to dissipate before opening the upper furnace cover and ash outlet for cleaning. Failure to do so may cause an explosion.
    Two, when testing the quality of the gas for ignition, the test should be conducted at the ignition port next to the gas stove, not at the mixing carburetor port of the engine's intake pipe. When starting the engine after the flame is lit, the flame must be smothered by hand before starting, otherwise an explosion may occur.
    Three, ignition should not be too early or too late. Because the engine is either too hot or too cold, filter explosions may occur.
    Four, the combustion zone of the furnace should always maintain a certain height. After the machine is started, the furnace should be cleared frequently through the flue (approximately every 20 to 30 minutes). If the furnace is not cleared in time, the combustion zone will rise, which may damage the intake manifold in minor cases, or cause an explosion in severe cases.
    Five, if possible, slightly modifying the filter can also prevent explosions. The method is to remove the caps from the drain outlets of the three filters and attach a section of rubber hose, the length of which is determined by need. Insert the other end of the rubber hose into a bucket of water, so that even if an explosion occurs, the high-pressure gas inside the filter will escape through the hose, preventing the filter from being damaged.

    怎样防止煤气炉爆炸？
    我们第一汽车制造厂制造了大批煤气发动机支援各地农村使用。但是发现CA4型煤气发生炉的滤清器没有安全装置，使用时稍不注意，就会发生滤清器爆炸，轻的会损坏机器，重的会造成事故。为了避免发生事故，我提出以下几种防止方法：
    一、煤气机使用后清炉时，先把三个炉子的滤清器盖打开，等器内的瓦斯排出后，再打开上炉盖和出灰口进行清炉。否则就会引起爆炸。
    二、点火试验瓦斯质量好坏时，应该在煤气炉旁边的点火口点试，不要在发动机进气管口的混合壶口点火。火点着后要起动时，还必须把点着的火用手闷熄才能起动，否则也有可能引起爆炸。
    三、点火不宜过早或过晚。因为发动机过热或过冷，都有可能引起滤清器的爆炸。
    四、炉子的燃烧区应经常保持一定的高度，机器发动后要经常在通炉口通炉（约二十分钟至三十分钟一次）。若不及时通炉，燃烧区上升，轻则把吸气的莲蓬头烧坏，重则也会造成爆炸。
    五、如果有条件的话，把滤清器稍为改装一下，也能避免爆炸。方法是在三个滤清器的放水口把盖拆掉，套上一节胶皮管，长度按需要决定。胶管的另一端插入水桶内，这样就是发生爆炸，因为滤清器内的高压气体从此管内冲出，也不致将滤清器炸坏。
