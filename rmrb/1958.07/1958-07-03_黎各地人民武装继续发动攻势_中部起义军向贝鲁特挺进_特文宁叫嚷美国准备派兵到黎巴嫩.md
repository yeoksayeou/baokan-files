Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 2nd - According to reports, on July 1st, the Lebanese uprising people's forces continued to launch offensives against the pro-Western government forces in many areas. The fighting in the central Shouf mountains was particularly fierce, with the uprising army, under the command of Jumblatt, continuing to advance victoriously towards Beirut. The government army deployed tanks, aircraft, and artillery against Jumblatt's attacking forces.

In Tripoli, the second largest city, fierce fighting continues. In many areas of the city, the uprising army is approaching the government forces' positions and throwing grenades. The uprising army repelled the tanks attacking them.

The uprising army in southern Lebanon also launched an offensive against the government forces' positions in the city of Tyre. The road from the capital Beirut to the important southern city of Sidon has been cut off.

The uprising people's forces also blew up many bridges in the eastern Bekaa region on July 1st to prevent the Chamoun forces from advancing north.

Meanwhile, according to Damascus's "Al-Nour" newspaper today, the Lebanese government army, supported by American and British pilots in their planes, launched a counter-offensive against the people's forces in Ainab on July 1st. The newspaper also said that the government army also launched attacks on the residents of Ain Kinia and Shuba villages north of Marjayoun in southern Lebanon, but suffered a disastrous defeat. The residents of the aforementioned villages began to purge the members of the National Socialist Party and the Phalange Party from their villages. The residents also launched an attack on the government forces in the nearby village of Kfar, and occupied the village after a battle lasting an hour and a half. During the battle, the government forces attempted to escape, and many of them were captured.

According to the Voice of Free Lebanon radio broadcast on the evening of the 1st, Lebanese opposition leader and former Prime Minister Salam reiterated on the 1st that the opposition would resolutely oppose the dispatch of any police force to Lebanon, and that any solution to the current crisis must be based on Chamoun's immediate resignation. Salam said that as long as Chamoun remains in power, he is unwilling to seek any compromise solution to the crisis.

According to Damascus Radio, Jumblatt, the leader of the uprising forces in the Shouf mountains, said on July 1st that the Lebanese people would not recognize any new president elected by the current pseudo-parliament. Damascus Radio quoted Jumblatt's statement as saying, "If a solution to the crisis cannot be achieved, he will launch a general offensive to isolate Beirut." He also said that the United States and Britain are prepared to support a compromise solution to the crisis, but he did not disclose the details of the compromise.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd - Detroit Dispatch: Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Twining, openly clamored at a press conference in Detroit on the 1st that "the United States is ready to send troops to Lebanon if the situation requires such action."

Twining said that he "does not think (sending troops to Lebanon) would be any problem." He said, "We are now prepared to deal with anything that might happen - a full-scale war or a limited war."
