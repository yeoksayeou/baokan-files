Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 3rd. While focusing on the development of the steel industry, Shanghai's industrial leadership is also firmly grasping the machinery industry, striving to expand its production in every possible way. Currently, in addition to rushing to produce a large number of smelting equipment for the development of the East China steel industry, the machinery industry is also trying every means to increase the production of a large number of machine tools and power equipment. On the basis of this year's Great Leap Forward plan, Shanghai will increase the production of more than 5,000 machine tools and 200,000 kilowatts of generators in the second half of the year. The newly added machine tool production is equivalent to more than 50% of the original Great Leap Forward plan and can supply the establishment of 170 small and medium-sized general machinery factories in various places.

    Shanghai's industrial leadership recently analyzed the new situation that has emerged in the entire national economy after the great development of the national and East China steel industries. The great development of the steel industry has driven the great development of various industries such as machinery and electric power. According to the use of steel in various sectors of the national economy, almost 80% of the steel needs to be processed by machine tools before it can be used, and only about 20% is used directly. Therefore, after establishing a large number of steel factories, various places will inevitably establish a large number of machinery factories to digest steel. Therefore, organizing the existing machinery force as soon as possible to produce various equipment for the development of the machinery industry has become an urgent task for Shanghai's machinery industry.

    Since the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, Shanghai's machinery manufacturing force has tapped considerable potential and produced a large number of smelting equipment needed for the great development of the steel industry. Now, it is also trying every possible way to continue to tap potential, and is rushing to produce power equipment and machine tools. The existing electromechanical factories are the main force, including the repair departments of textile and light industries, the repair workshops of grain processing plants, the elevator repair departments of real estate management systems, the machine repair forces in printing and publishing, and the hardware production cooperatives, the experimental workshops of universities and technical schools, and other machinery manufacturing forces from various aspects are also urgently mobilized. They re-arrange production according to priorities. If one factory cannot produce a complete machine tool, several factories will cooperate.

    Shanghai's industrial leadership has especially focused on the weakest link in machinery industrial production—the casting and forging industry—and has taken emergency measures to ensure that the output of castings can catch up with the needs of machining. In June, the Shanghai Municipal Electromechanical Industry Bureau rushed to build thirteen sand casting factories, completing a project in twenty days that would have taken several months in the past, rapidly doubling the sand casting capacity. Many textile factories and light industrial factories have also built cupola furnaces and added sand casting rooms in order to manufacture machine tools.

    The theory of everything depending on equipment conditions and the inferiority complex of not believing in one's own strength have been shattered in the face of the masses' overwhelming creative enthusiasm. Many large parts that were originally considered impossible to process without large machine tools can now be processed on small machine tools, which has led to important developments in machine tool processing methods. If the steel from one open-hearth furnace is not enough to pour a large casting, the workers come up with ways to tap steel from two open-hearth furnaces at the same time. Small factories have no experience in casting large parts, so the workers learn and do it at the same time; if there is no twelve-foot planer, they try to process it on a six-foot planer, and the uneven places are then repaired by fitters. The original set of mechanical manufacturing processes has been broken through, and the level of mechanical manufacturing has been greatly improved. Some hardware production cooperatives that could only produce pliers and iron beds a month ago are now producing shapers and are undertaking the task of manufacturing hundreds of machine tools.

    Developing towards large, precise, and high-grade products is a very important link in Shanghai's current machinery industry and also the future development direction of Shanghai's machinery industry. This will enable Shanghai's machinery industry to better play its role as a base and support the development of machinery industries in various places. Some important construction projects, such as heavy machinery manufacturing plants and heavy machine tool manufacturing plants, will begin construction in the second half of this year. In order to further solve the difficulty of insufficient supply of castings and forgings, casting and forging centers will be established in several new electromechanical industrial zones.

    抓住钢铁又抓机械
    上海千方百计增产机床和电力设备
    新华社上海3日电　上海市工业领导部门在一手抓钢铁工业发展的同时，一手紧紧地抓住了机械工业，从各个方面来努力扩大机械工业的生产。目前，机械工业部门除了在为发展华东钢铁工业赶制大量冶炼设备以外，还正在千方百计地增产大批的机床和电力设备。在今年跃进计划的基础上，下半年上海要再增产五千台以上的机床和二十万瓩的发电机。新增加的机床产量，等于原来跃进计划的50％以上，可供各地建立一百七十个中小型的通用机械厂。
    上海市工业领导部门最近分析了全国和华东钢铁工业大发展以后，整个国民经济所出现的新形势。钢铁工业的大发展，已经带动了机械、电力等各项工业的大发展。按照国民经济各部门对钢铁的使用情况来看，几乎有80％的钢铁，都需经过机床加工以后才能使用，只有20％左右是直接使用的。因此，各地在建立了大批钢铁工厂以后，必然要建立大批机械工厂来消化钢铁。因此，及早组织现有机械力量，生产发展机械工业用的各项设备，已成为上海机械工业的当务之急。
    党的八大二次会议以后，上海市的机械制造力量已挖掘了相当大的潜力，生产钢铁工业大发展所需要的大量冶炼设备。现在，又千方百计地继续挖潜力，突击赶制电力设备和工作母机，以现有的机电工厂为主，包括纺织、轻工业的修理部门、粮食加工厂的修理车间、房地产管理系统的电梯机修部门、印刷出版方面的机修力量以及五金生产合作社、大专技术学校的实验工场等各个方面的机械制造力量，也都紧急动员起来，他们分别轻重缓急，重新安排生产。一个工厂不能生产一台完整的机床，便由几个工厂共同协作。
    上海市工业领导部门特别抓住了机械工业生产中最薄弱的环节——铸锻工业，采取紧急措施，使铸件的产量能赶上机械加工的需要。6月份，上海市机电工业局突击兴建了十三个翻砂工厂，用二十天时间完成了过去需要几个月才能完成的工程，使翻砂能力迅速提高了一倍。很多纺织工厂和轻工业工厂，为了制造机床，也盖起了冲天炉，新添了翻砂间。
    一切设备条件论、不相信自己力量的自卑心理，在群众排山倒海的创造干劲面前被粉碎了。许多原来认为没有大机床不能加工的大部件，现在在小机床上同样可以加工，使机床加工方法有了重要的发展。一座平炉的钢水，不够浇一个大铸件，职工们就想办法使两座平炉同时出钢。小工厂没有铸造大件的经验，工人便边学边做；没有十二尺的龙门刨床，就想办法在六尺的小刨床上加工，刨不平的地方再由钳工修整。原先一套机械制造的工艺被冲破了，机械制造水平有了很大提高。一些在一个月以前还只能制造老虎钳、铁床的五金生产合作社，现在却生产出了牛头刨床，担负了成百台机床的制造任务。
    向大型的、精密的、高级的产品发展，是上海当前机械工业的极重要一环，也是上海机械工业今后的发展方向。这将使上海机械工业更好地发挥基地作用，支援各地机械工业的发展。一些重要的建设工程，如重型机器制造厂和重型机床制造厂，将在今年下半年动工。为了进一步解决铸锻件供应不足的困难，全市将在几个新的机电工业区，分别建立铸锻中心。
