Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 22nd - On the evening of the 22nd, half a million people gathered in Cairo's Republic Square to express the Arab Union people's support for the newly established Republic of Iraq and to oppose the armed aggression of the United States and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan.

As the Cairo Radio broadcaster said, the celebration of the sixth anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution turned into "Support Baghdad Day."

President Nasser rode in an open car to attend the conference, with Iraqi Minister of Justice Mustafa Ali sitting with him.

As their car drove through the streets, people threw flowers at them. Mustafa Ali was invited to lead an Iraqi delegation including three other ministers to Cairo.

From the afternoon onwards, people flocked to the square. About 20,000 citizens of Port Said came specially to attend the conference.

When Nasser and the Iraqi dignitaries ascended the podium hung with the flags of the Arab Union, Yemen, and Iraq, the crowd cheered them warmly. The Iraqi dignitaries stood up four times to thank the masses for their welcome. Before the conference began, doves of peace were released.

Iraqi Minister of Justice Mustafa Ali spoke first, followed by Minister of Education Omar. Both of them brought congratulations from the Iraqi people who had freed themselves from the rule of imperialist agents and assured that they would cooperate with the Arab Union to liberate the Arab people.

Nasser delivered a long speech at the conference, which was warmly cheered by the attendees.

President Nasser announced that he fully supported the proposal of Soviet Chairman Khrushchev to convene a five-nation government summit to discuss the Middle East issue.

Nasser said that his recent talks with Khrushchev in Moscow discussed the development of the world situation and measures to stop aggression against the Arab world, as well as to safeguard the independence of Arab countries. He said he received deep sympathy.

Nasser said that the Arab United Republic, while mobilizing its forces in the face of the clouds of war, is willing to reiterate its desire for peace. We hope to live in peace, and we do not want our country to become a base for aggression against other countries. We are all armed to defend our independence and resist any aggression against any part of the Arab world.

Nasser reiterated that an attack on Iraq or any Arab country would be regarded as an attack on all Arab countries.

Nasser said that the imperialists who caused the current crisis in the Middle East did not realize that the people were advancing and had not learned their lesson. He said, "This crisis was imposed on us from the outside by the imperialists, who want to put us within their sphere of influence, want to order us around, and want us to obey them."

He pointed out that the pretext currently raised by the imperialists to the Republic of Iraq on the oil issue is the same as the pretext they raised to Egypt on the Suez Canal issue two years ago.

Nasser also said that the American aggression against Lebanon will be defeated, and the people will win in Beirut. He said that we have seen what fate awaits the imperialist agents, who cannot survive without the protection of imperialist cannons, but these cannons cannot protect imperialism itself. Nasser condemned King Hussein of Jordan for selling out the Arabs and opening the doors of Jordan to the imperialists. He pointed out that the British aggression against Jordan will also be defeated.

Nasser said that the people will win in Beirut, Amman, and Algiers, just as they won in Iraq.

He also said, "All countries in the Persian Gulf will achieve their national status, and every country that wants freedom will achieve victory. There is no place for imperialism among us."

The applause and cheers of the crowd frequently interrupted Nasser's speech.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 22nd - Thousands of people in Damascus held a demonstration on the 21st, demanding that the aggressive troops of American and British imperialism immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

The marching队伍 included farmers, workers, youth and intellectuals, who walked through the main streets of Damascus, expressing their burning anger at the occupation of Lebanon and Jordan by American and British imperialists. The demonstrators held up slogans such as: "Oppose interference in Lebanon and Jordan!" "Long live the friendship between the Arabs and the Soviet Union!" "Long live the unity of the Arab United Republic and the Republic of Iraq in defending independence and peace!". The demonstrators also shouted slogans against American and British imperialism and the traitors Chamoun and Hussein.

Some Iraqi and Jordanian youths here also held up the slogan "Iraqi youth and Jordanian youth support Iraq with blood."

On the same day, Ahmed Samman, chairman of the mass organization conference here, sent a telegram to Hammarskjöld, firmly demanding that the American and British troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. This newly formed conference represents thirty-five cultural and educational groups. The conference decided to appeal to all international organizations, demanding that they condemn the armed interference of the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan and oppose this act of aggression that violates the UN Charter and international conventions.

    尼罗河畔发出抗议美英海盗的怒吼
    开罗五十万人集会反侵略
    纳赛尔说阿拉伯各国不能分割，决心武装保卫独立
    据新华社开罗22日电　22日晚上有五十万人在开罗的共和国广场举行集会，表示阿联人民声援新成立的伊拉克共和国，并且反对美国和英国对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装侵略。
    正如开罗电台广播员所说的，这次举行的庆祝埃及革命六周年的纪念日变成了“支援巴格达日”。
    纳赛尔总统乘敞篷车前往参加大会，伊拉克司法部长穆斯塔法·阿里同他坐在一起。
    他们的汽车驶过街道时，人们纷纷投以鲜花。穆斯塔法·阿里是应邀率领一个包括其他三位部长的伊拉克代表团到开罗的。
    从下午起，人们就拥到了广场。约有二万名塞得港的公民专程前来参加大会。
    当纳赛尔和伊拉克的贵宾们登上悬挂着阿联、也门、伊拉克的国旗的主席台时，人群向他们热烈欢呼。伊拉克贵宾们起立了四次来答谢群众的欢迎。大会开始前放出了和平鸽。
    伊拉克司法部长穆斯塔法·阿里首先讲话，接着由教育部长奥马尔讲话。他们两位都带来了摆脱了帝国主义代理人统治的伊拉克人民的祝贺，并且保证要同阿联合作解放阿拉伯人民。
    纳赛尔在大会上发表了长篇讲话，受到了到会群众的热烈欢呼。
    纳赛尔总统宣布，他完全支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫提出的召开五国政府首脑会议来讨论中东问题的建议。
    纳赛尔说，他最近在莫斯科同赫鲁晓夫的会谈讨论了世界局势的发展和制止对阿拉伯世界的侵略，以及维护阿拉伯国家的独立的措施。他说，他得到了深切的同情。
    纳赛尔说，阿拉伯联合共和国在战争的阴云面前正在动员它的力量的时候，愿意再次表明它的和平愿望。我们希望生活在和平中，我们不要我们的国家变成一个作为侵略其它国家使用的基地。我们全都武装起来保卫我们的独立，抗击对阿拉伯世界任何一部分的任何侵略。
    纳赛尔再一次声明，对伊拉克或任何阿拉伯国家的攻击将被看作是对所有阿拉伯国家的攻击。
    纳赛尔说，造成中东目前危机的帝国主义者并没有认识到人民在迈进，而且也没有接受教训。他说，“这种危机是帝国主义者从外部施加在我们身上的，他们想把我们放在他们的势力范围之内，想向我们发号施令，让我们服从他们。”
    他指出，帝国主义者目前就石油问题向伊拉克共和国提出的借口同他们在两年前就苏伊士运河问题向埃及提出的借口一样。
    纳赛尔还说，美国对黎巴嫩的侵略将要被击败，人民将在贝鲁特获得胜利。他说，我们已经看到过帝国主义的代理人所要遭受的命运是怎样的，这些人要不是在帝国主义的大炮保护下就不能生存，但是，这些大炮也不能保卫帝国主义自己。纳赛尔谴责约旦国王侯赛因出卖阿拉伯人，为帝国主义者大开约旦的门户。他指出，英国对约旦的侵略也将被击败。
    纳赛尔说，人民将在贝鲁特、安曼和阿尔及尔获得胜利，正如他们在伊拉克获得了胜利一样。
    他还说，“波斯湾所有国家都将取得它们的国家地位，而每一个要自由的国家都会取得胜利。在我们中间是没有帝国主义的立足之地的。”
    群众的鼓掌和欢呼声频频打断了纳赛尔的讲话。
    据新华社大马士革22日电　大马士革的数千名群众在21日举行了示威游行，要求美英帝国主义的侵略军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    游行队伍包括农民、工人、青年和知识分子，他们走过了大马士革的主要街道，表示了他们对美英帝国主义者占领黎巴嫩和约旦的如火如炽的愤怒。游行群众高举着这样一些标语：“反对干涉黎巴嫩和约旦！”“阿拉伯和苏联的友谊万岁！”“阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克共和国保卫独立和和平的团结万岁！”。游行队伍并且高呼口号反对美英帝国主义和卖国贼夏蒙和侯赛因。
    这里的一些伊拉克青年和约旦青年手里还举着“伊拉克青年和约旦青年用鲜血支持伊拉克”的标语。
    同一天，这里的群众组织会议主席艾哈迈德·萨曼打电报给哈马舍尔德，坚决要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。这个刚组成的会议代表了三十五个文化团体和教育团体。会议决定向一切国际组织呼吁，要求他们谴责美英对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉，反对这种违反联合国宪章和国际公约的侵略行动。
