    The people of Lomé, the capital of Togo, held a grand parade on the "May Day" festival in 1958. The picture shows the parade.
    The struggle of the people of the Union of South Africa for democratic freedom is on the rise. The picture shows the people of Johannesburg holding up a sign reading "We want freedom" and holding a mass rally in the park to oppose the policy of racial discrimination.
    The people of Kenya are brutally exploited by the British colonialists and live in great suffering. The picture shows stone miners in Mombasa, Kenya, engaged in heavy labor under the scorching sun.
    The British colonialists are carrying out a bloody reign of terror against the people of Kenya. Tens of thousands of Kenyans have been imprisoned in concentration camps and subjected to severe torture. This is the scene of a concentration camp blocked by British guns.
