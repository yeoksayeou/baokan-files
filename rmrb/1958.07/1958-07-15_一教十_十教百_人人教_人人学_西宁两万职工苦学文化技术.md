One Teaches Ten, Ten Teach a Hundred, Everyone Teaches, Everyone Learns
20,000 Workers in Xining Diligently Study Culture and Technology

(By our newspaper) The more than 20,000 workers in the industrial and transportation systems of the Xining area, Qinghai Province, are making a great advance towards culture and technology.

Since April of this year, the vast number of workers in the industrial and transportation systems of the Xining area have begun cultural and technical studies. After studying the General Line, the workers' enthusiasm for learning has become even greater. At present, more than 70% of the workers are participating in the study, and some units have reached 100%.

Many leading cadres in the industrial and transportation systems of the Xining area are taking the lead in participating in cultural and technical studies. Amateur cultural schools and technical schools have been generally established in various units. Some units have established technical research associations (groups), and new and old workers, cadres, and workers have signed apprenticeship contracts. In order to accelerate cultural and technical learning, various units have adopted a variety of methods. Some units have adopted the "hen laying eggs" method of one teaching ten, and ten teaching a hundred; after the students learn, they become teachers. Veteran workers and advanced producers serve as instructors, and technical problems are explained and resolved in a timely manner, thus combining technical learning with solving key production issues. Some units have adopted methods such as everyone being a teacher, everyone being a student, and delivering textbooks to the door, resulting in situations where couples teach and learn from each other, and fathers and sons and apprentices learn from each other.

Due to the adoption of various methods to study culture and technology, some units have now achieved great results. In the past, the steel grinders in the flour milling workshop of the Xining Flour Mill had low production efficiency, and the workers had been unable to find the cause. After technical study, they found that the grinding rollers were not installed in a balanced manner. They jointly studied and added eccentricity to the small shaft of the steel grinder, which greatly increased the flour yield. In the past, the papermaking workshop of the Qinghai Chemical Plant used to produce eight knives of paper a day, and the paper drying workers could not dry them all. After technical study, the paper making workers reduced the damage rate of the paper, and the paper drying workers mastered the changes in the weather. Therefore, they can now make and dry twelve knives of paper every day. (Li Ying)

    一教十　十教百　人人教　人人学
    西宁两万职工苦学文化技术
    本报讯　青海省西宁地区工业交通系统两万多名职工向文化、技术大进军。
    今年4月以来，西宁地区工业交通系统的广大职工开始了文化、技术学习。经过总路线学习以后，职工们的学习劲头更大了。目前参加学习的职工已占职工总数的70％以上，有些单位达到百分之百。
    西宁地区工业交通系统许多领导干部都带头参加文化、技术学习。各单位普遍地成立了业余文化学校和技术学校。有的单位成立了技术研究会（组），新老工人、干部和工人之间订立了师徒合同。各单位为了加快文化、技术学习，采取了多种多样的办法。有的单位采取“母鸡生蛋”一教十、十教百的办法，学生学会后，就当先生。并由老工人、先进生产者担任教员，有了技术问题及时讲解，及时研究解决，因而使学习技术和解决生产关键结合起来。有的单位采取人人当教员，个个是学生，课本送上门等办法，出现了夫妻互教互学，父子、师徒互学的情况。
    由于采取了各种办法学习文化、技术，现在有些单位已收到很大效果。西宁面粉厂制粉车间的钢磨过去生产效率不高，工人们一直找不出原因，经过技术学习后，发现磨棍安装得不平衡。他们共同研究把钢磨小轴加上偏心，使出粉率大大提高。青海化工厂造纸车间过去每天捞八刀纸，晒纸工人晒不出来，经过技术学习，捞纸工人降低了纸的破损率，晒纸工人掌握了天气的变化，因此，现在每天已能捞、晒十二刀纸。　（李瑛）
