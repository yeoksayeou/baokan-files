Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 1st: Hiranuma Kiichirō, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, published an article in "Akahata" today, calling on the Japanese people to carry forward the spirit of the Japan Peace Congress held in mid-June and expand the peace movement.

Hiranuma said that representatives from all over the country discussed the current situation with unusual enthusiasm and sincerity at the Japan Peace Congress, and determined the future direction of the peace movement: to prevent Japan from implementing nuclear armament and to safeguard democracy. Hiranuma said that this is the correct policy that suits the current situation, and it is of great significance for the combination of the peace movement and the workers' movement.

The article pointed out that opposing the transportation of nuclear weapons into Japan and demanding the immediate conclusion of an agreement banning nuclear weapons testing are not two different things. At the same time, this is also closely related to the conspiracy to establish a so-called "Northeast Asia Alliance" military group composed of Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Therefore, crushing the San Francisco Treaty system that subordinates Japan to the United States has become an urgent issue at present.

Hiranuma pointed out in the article that since the relations between Japan and China have become tense, the movement to promote Japan-China friendship and restore diplomatic relations between the two countries has become the main task of the current Japanese peace movement. Hiranuma called on the Japanese people to concentrate all their efforts on solving the tense issue of Japan-China relations.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 1st: People from all walks of life in western Japan held a National Assembly in Fukuoka City on June 28 to break the tense situation in Japan-China relations. The meeting passed a resolution demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government change its policy of hostility towards China and immediately take measures in a friendly manner to solve the various unresolved issues between the two countries.

The resolution demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government take various effective measures to restore normal diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

The resolution also demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government give full support and assistance to the implementation of the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement, and be responsible for resolving the issue of conniving at thugs insulting the Chinese national flag.

More than two thousand representatives from major cities in western Japan attended the National Assembly. They were representatives and citizens from industrial, commercial, trade, aquatic product trade unions, and women from Fukuoka, Kumamoto, Shimonoseki, Moji, Yawata, and neighboring urban and rural areas of Fukuoka City.

Governor of Fukuoka Prefecture, Toyoshika Tsuchiya, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Matsumoto Jiichiro, Director-General Uchiyama Kanzo, and Managing Director Yoshida Noriharu all delivered speeches at the meeting.

    平野义太郎号召日本人民扩展和平运动
    促进日中友好已成为当前主要课题
    日本西部地方各界人士集会要政府恢复日中邦交
    据新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎今天在“赤旗报”上著文，号召日本人民发扬6月中旬举行的日本和平大会的精神，扩展和平运动。
    平野说，来自全国各地的代表在日本和平大会上以少见的热心、诚恳的态度讨论了目前的形势，确定了今后和平运动的方针：阻止日本实行核武装和维护民主。平野说，这是适合当前形势的正确方针。并且对于和平运动同工人运动的结合具有重大意义。
    文章指出，反对把核武器运进日本境内和要求立即缔结禁止试验核武器的协定不是两回事情，同时这同建立由日本、南朝鲜、台湾组成的所谓“东北亚同盟”军事集团阴谋也有分不开的密切关系。因此，粉碎使日本从属于美国的旧金山和约体制已经成为目前的紧要问题。
    平野在文章里指出，自从日中两国关系趋于紧张以后，促进日中友好和恢复日中两国邦交的运动已经成为当前日本和平运动的主要课题。平野号召日本人民集中全力解决日中关系紧张的问题。
    据新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本西部地方各界人民6月28日在福冈市举行打开日中关系紧张局面国民大会，会上通过决议要求岸信介政府改变敌视中国的政策，并且以友好的态度立即采取措施解决两国间悬而未决的各项问题。
    决议要求岸信介政府采取各种有效措施来恢复中日两国的正常邦交。
    决议还要求岸信介政府对第四次日中贸易协定的实施给予完全支持和协助，并且负责解决纵容暴徒侮辱中国国旗的问题。
    出席这个国民大会的有日本西部主要城市的代表二千多人，他们是福冈、熊本、下关、门司、八幡以及福冈市邻近城乡的工业、商业、贸易、水产工会和妇女等各界代表和市民。
    福冈县知事土屋香鹿，日中友好协会会长松本治一郎、理事长内山完造、常务理事吉田法晴等都在会上致词。
