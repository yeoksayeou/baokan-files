    Peasant Ballad Poet – Li Zhengtang
    Zhao Hexiang

    Li Zhengtang has been writing ballad poems for five or six years. He is the vice director and Party branch propaganda committee member of the Flag Agriculture Cooperative in Huwang Village, Dongwangzhuang Township, Pingyuan County, Shandong. People in nearby villages say he can "speak like a book." Last year, he participated in the Pingyuan County Farmers' Amateur Arts Performance, gave a wonderful performance, won praise, and the County People's Committee awarded him a first-class outstanding creation award certificate.

    Recently, I visited this ballad poet. He took me to tour their agricultural cooperative's wheat field. Ha! The wheat was chest-high, and the wind blew, creating a vast expanse of waves. The scene of abundance completely captivated us. When we sat down to rest, Li Zhengtang squinted his eyes and said to me: I'll recite a ballad, you listen. Wow! I really didn't expect him to "come" so quickly, truly living up to his reputation. As he sang, I wrote it down:

    "The sun shines and the earth is bright,
    Seeing the wheat, I'm so delighted;
    So delighted, my heart blooms,
    I compose a song to sing its praises;
    A field of wheat, green and yellow,
    Growing so vigorously…
    The height reaches three feet,
    The head is three inches and some change;
    Victory flowers will bear fruit,
    Wheat ears are golden orange;
    Everyone smiles with joy,
    Devoting patriotic grain to be top of the list."

    In previous years, Li Zhengtang's ballads were not valued, and his creative enthusiasm was not high. The Party and the government have always valued amateur creation. When they discovered his creative talent, they recruited him to participate in the county's performance. Some responsible comrades also encouraged him to work hard on his creations. So Li Zhengtang's enthusiasm was boosted, and he wrote many ballad poems. Because he could use ballads to promptly publicize the Party's policies, he was also named a model propaganda worker of the Party.

    Due to Li Zhengtang's influence, Huwang Village has simply become a village of ballad poems. If you walk into this village, look, all one hundred and eight blackboards are filled with ballad poems. Whether it's setting production plans, small plans, or summarizing work, it's always inseparable from ballad poems. Primary school students can sing ballad poems, and even kindergarten children, only three to five years old, know three to five ballad poems; they started learning to talk with the language of poetry. These poems are catchy, clear, and lively. Here's a ballad that the children sang, which I wrote down:

      "White clouds, drifting with the wind,
    Please Uncle to take a letter;
    When you see Chairman Mao,
    Please say hello for me."

    Li Zhengtang is moved by the rapidly changing reality. He sings about the Party's wise leadership, the tremendous changes in the countryside, and the heroic deeds of the people in the Great Leap Forward anytime and anywhere.

    He feels deeply about the tremendous changes that have taken place in his village. He sings:

      "Think, look, and think again,
    Let's talk about the changes in our village;
    A wide road in the center of the street,
    Newly planted trees on both sides;
    A telephone is installed at the crossroads,
    Wa la wa la, the sound rings out;
    A newly built bathhouse north of the road,
    Leap Forward slogans plastered on the walls."

    Li Zhengtang's ballad poems have played a significant role among the masses. After the production team saw his poem about small plans, they arranged their work based on this ballad poem. After the ballad poem "Recycling Waste" was written on the blackboard, many commune members took out gold, silver, and bronze utensils that they had treasured for many years and sold them to the state to support industrial construction.

    农民快板诗人——李祯堂
    赵鹤翔
    李祯堂写快板诗已经有五、六年的历史了。他是山东平原县董王庄乡户王村旗帜农业社的副主任，党的支部宣传委员。附近几个村子的人们，都说他能“出口成章”。去年他参加了平原县农民业余文艺会演，作了精彩的演唱，博得了好评，县人民委员会奖给他一等优秀创作奖奖状。
    最近，我访问了这位快板诗人，他带着我在他们农业社的小麦地里逛。哈！齐胸高的麦子，风吹过，掀起了万顷波浪。丰收的景象完全把我们迷住了。当我们坐下来休息时，李祯堂的眼睛眯?着，对我说：我说段快板你听吧。啊呀呀！我真没想到他“来”的这么快，真是名不虚传。他一边唱，我一边记：
    “阳光一照大地亮，
    见小麦，喜的慌；
    喜的我，心花放，
    编出歌儿把它唱；
    一片小麦青又黄，
    长得实在太兴旺……
    身高足有三尺整，
    头大三寸有余零；
    胜利开花要结果，
    小麦穗头黄橙橙；
    人人见了笑盈盈，
    爱国粮上报头名。”
    在前几年，李祯堂的快板没有被人重视，他的创作劲头也不大。党和政府是一贯重视业余创作的，当发现他有创作才能时，就吸收他参加县的会演。一些负责同志并鼓励他努力创作。于是李祯堂的劲鼓起来了，他写了很多快板诗。因为能及时用快板对党的政策等进行宣传，他还被评为党的模范宣传员。
    由于李祯堂的影响，户王村简直成了一个快板诗的村庄。你走进这个村，看吧，一百零八块黑板上全部写着快板诗。订生产计划，小段计划，总结工作，总离不开快板诗。小学生能唱快板诗，托儿所的孩子，只不过是三、五岁，就会三至五首快板诗，他们开始是用诗的语言学话的。这些诗朗朗上口，明快生动。下面是孩子们唱，我记下来的一首快板：
      “白云彩，随风飘，
    请求伯伯把信捎；
    你们见了毛主席，
    千万替我问声好。”
    李祯堂被日新月异的现实生活感动着，他随时随地都在歌唱党的英明领导和农村的巨大变化，以及人民群众在大跃进中的英雄事迹。
    他对自己村庄发生的巨大的变化感受很深，他唱道：
      “想想看，看看想，
    咱村的变化讲一讲；
    大马路在街中央，
    新栽的树木在两旁；
    十字街上安电话，
    哇啦哇啦连声响；
    道北新建洗澡塘，
    跃进标语贴满墙。”
    李祯堂的快板诗，在群众中起到了很大的作用。当生产队看到他的关于小段计划的诗以后，便根据这个快板诗去安排工作。当“收购废品”的快板诗写到黑板上后，很多社员把多少年珍藏的金、银、铜器拿出来，卖给了国家，支援工业建设。
