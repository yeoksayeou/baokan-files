    Natural Latex Directly Made into Tires
    Cordless Tires Perform Well

    Two new creations with significant technological and economic value have emerged in China's tire industry: the direct manufacturing of automobile tires using natural latex and the successful creation of cordless tires.

    Manufacturing a tire requires many steps, including coagulation, smoking, rubber mixing, calendaring, extrusion, forming, shaping, and vulcanization. Now, by using natural latex directly from rubber trees, adding reinforcing agents, and directly injecting it into molds, only three steps are needed: forming, shaping, and vulcanization.

    Cord is used in manufacturing various tires for cars, airplanes, etc. Its role in the tire is like the bones in the human body, used to enhance the tensile and compressive properties of the rubber. However, its manufacturing process is complex and requires a lot of manual labor. Manufacturing cordless tires can eliminate many steps, directly forming from the ingredients, greatly reducing manual labor. The first cordless tire made in China has been tested and performs as well as the corded tire of the same specification.

    There is no systematic theory or mature experience in the world for directly manufacturing tires with natural latex; cordless tires are also a research topic for some developed rubber industries, and have not yet been successful. The technicians and workers of the Rubber Industry Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry in China bravely experimented, creating theoretical basis in the experiments, and after fighting hard for twenty days, finally succeeded in the trial production.

### 天然胶乳直接制成轮胎  无帘线轮胎性能良好

    天然胶乳直接制成轮胎
    无帘线轮胎性能良好
    我国轮胎工业又出现了两项有重大技术和经济价值的新创造：用天然胶乳直接制造汽车轮胎和无帘线轮胎成功。
    制造一条轮胎需要经过凝固、烟熏、炼胶、压延、压出、成型、定型和硫化等许多工序。现在，利用橡胶树流出来的天然胶乳加上增强剂直接灌注到模型上，只要成型、定型和硫化三个工序就行了。
    帘线是制造汽车、飞机等各种轮胎用的。它在轮胎里的作用就像人体里的骨胳一样，用来增强橡胶的拉力、压力等性能。但是它的制造过程复杂，需要很多手工辅助劳动。制造无帘线轮胎可以省去很多工序，由配料直接成型，手工劳动大大减少。我国制成的第一条无帘线轮胎，经过试验，性能跟同规格的有帘线轮胎一样。
    用天然胶乳直接制造轮胎在世界上还没有系统的理论和成熟的经验；无帘线轮胎也是一些橡胶工业发达的国家研究的课题，尚未成功。我国化学工业部橡胶工业研究所的技术人员和工人们勇敢试验，在试验中创造理论根据，先后奋战二十天，终于试制成功。（新华社）
