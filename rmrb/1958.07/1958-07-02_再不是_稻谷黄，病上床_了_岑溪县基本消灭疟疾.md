No Longer "Rice Turns Yellow, Sickness Hits the Bed"
Cenxi County Basically Eliminates Malaria

Cenxi County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has eliminated malaria ahead of schedule, becoming a basically malaria-free county.

Cenxi County used to be plagued by malaria. In 1953, the number of cases reached over 100,000. After several years of treatment, the number of cases decreased to more than 3,800, and the incidence rate dropped from 350 per thousand to 11.56 per thousand, completely eliminating high-malaria areas. In March of this year, the county mobilized more than 400 doctors of traditional Chinese and Western medicine to complete anti-relapse treatment for more than 3,800 people within seven days. In particular, since January of this year, the county's patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene has achieved a decisive victory, mosquitoes have been greatly reduced, and the incidence of malaria has decreased significantly. In March, the number of cases in the county was 97, in April it dropped to 33, and in May it dropped to 24, with an incidence rate of only 0.08 per ten thousand of the total population. This has fundamentally changed the historical situation of "rice turns yellow, sickness hits the bed."

The county has always attached importance to epidemic prevention work. It not only mobilized and organized doctors of traditional Chinese and Western medicine to go to the countryside to fight malaria, but also held anti-malaria training courses to train key personnel. It adopted methods of assigning areas of responsibility, delivering medicines to homes, and supervising medication, basically controlling the spread of malaria.

    再不是“稻谷黄，病上床”了
    岑溪县基本消灭疟疾
    广西僮族自治区岑溪县提前消灭了疟疾，成为基本无疟疾县。
    岑溪县过去疟疾流行。1953年发病人数达十万之多。经过几年来的治疗，发病人数降低到三千八百多人，发病率由千分之三百五十降到千分之十一点五六，完全消灭了高疟区。今年3月，这个县又动员了四百余名中西医，七天内完成了三千八百多人抗复发治疗。特别是今年1月以来，全县除四害、讲卫生运动取得决定性胜利，蚊子大大减少，疟疾发病率显著下降。3月份全县发病人数九十七人，4月份下降到三十三人，5月份又降到二十四人，发病率只占总人数的万分之零点八。根本改变了历史上“稻谷黄，病上床”的状况。
    这个县一向重视防疫工作，不仅动员组织中西医下乡抗疟，还举办了抗疟训练班，培养了骨干，采取分片包干，送药上门，监督服药的办法，基本上控制了疟疾的蔓延。
