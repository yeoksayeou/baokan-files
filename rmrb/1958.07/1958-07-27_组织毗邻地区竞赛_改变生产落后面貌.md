    Organize Competition Between Adjacent Regions
    Change Backward Production Outlook
    (Reported by our newspaper) The way Huangpi County, Hubei Province, organizes red flag competitions between remote townships and cooperatives with inconvenient transportation and townships and cooperatives bordering neighboring counties has been very effective in reversing the backwardness of these regions and striving for balanced production increases.
    The Jianshe Township in Huangpi County is located in the northernmost mountainous area of the county, and it is only separated from the Mier Township in Hong'an County by a mountain. The agricultural cooperatives under these two townships were known as backward cooperatives in the townships in the past. This spring, the Hongchun No. 1 Cooperative of Mier Township in Hong'an County issued a challenge to the Central Cooperative and the Xinfa Cooperative of Jianshe Township in Huangpi County, launching an inter-county joint cooperative competition. In the past half year, these three cooperatives have visited and evaluated each other in a timely manner according to each production season, greatly promoting production. Now they have all changed from the original third-class cooperatives to first-class cooperatives. The Xinfa Cooperative's wheat yield per mu last year was only 130 jin, but this year it is 252 jin per mu. Last year, the Central Cooperative's 260 mu of early rice yielded 310 jin per mu, and this year's 310 mu of early rice is estimated to yield about 700 jin per mu. Before the competition, the Xinfa Cooperative had three "many": many arguments, many strange remarks and complaints about the government, and many cooperative members leaving. Now there are also three "many", which are: many people catching up with the advanced, many big-character posters, and many exchanges of experience and visits. Last year, the average attendance rate of cooperative members in this cooperative was only 70%, but this year it has reached more than 95%. The original five backward cooperatives in Jianshe Township have now become first-class cooperatives, and this township has also changed from the original third-class township to a first-class township.
    According to the experience of Jianshe Township, this kind of competition between adjacent townships and cooperatives in two counties can promote districts and townships to strengthen their leadership over remote cooperatives with inconvenient transportation. The masses of the Central Cooperative once described the situation there as: "The heavens are high and the emperor is far away, no one cares about major events; cadres do not come to govern, and production is done at will." After the competition started, the township party branch criticized the township cadres for their simple fear of trouble and neglect of the idea of ​​transforming backward townships and cooperatives, and appointed the first secretary of the township branch to reside in the Central Cooperative and the township head to reside in the Xinfa Cooperative. They adopted the method of large-scale airing of views, large-scale debates, and large-scale discussions to solve some long-standing problems, thereby making the production enthusiasm of cooperative members unprecedentedly high.
    In remote areas with inconvenient transportation, there are often some townships and cooperatives with backward work. According to a survey of eight townships in Huangpi County bordering neighboring counties, the grain yield per unit area is generally 30% lower than the average yield per mu in the county. Since Huangpi County promoted the method of Jianshe Township, it has initially changed the backwardness of these areas. Now the adjacent townships and cooperatives of Hong'an, Xinzhou, Dawu, Xiaogan and other counties near this county have launched open or secret competitions, which have powerfully promoted production.

    组织毗邻地区竞赛
    改变生产落后面貌
    本报讯　湖北省黄陂县组织交通不便的边远乡、社和邻县交界的乡、社开展红旗竞赛的办法，对扭转这些地区的落后面貌，争取平衡增产，很有成效。
    黄陂县的建设乡在这个县的极北部山区，它和红安县的觅儿乡只隔一个山头。这两个乡所属的几个农业社过去都是乡里著名的落后社。今年春天，红安县觅儿乡红春一社向黄陂县建设乡中心社和新发社发出挑战书，开展了邻县的联社竞赛。近半年来，这三个社在竞赛中，根据每个生产季节及时参观、评比，大大促进了生产。现在都由原来的三类社成为一类社了。新发社去年小麦亩产只一百三十斤，今年亩产二百五十二斤。去年中心社二百六十亩早稻亩产三百一十斤，今年三百一十亩早稻估产每亩可达七百斤左右。新发社在竞赛前有三多：闹意见的多，讲怪话和埋怨政府的多，社员外流的多。现在也有三多，这就是：赶先进的人多，大字报出的多，交流经验访问的多。去年这个社的社员出勤率平均只70％，今年达95％以上。建设乡原来有五个落后社现在都变成一类社了，这个乡也由原来的三类乡成为一类乡。
    根据建设乡的经验，这种两县相邻的乡、社竞赛，可以促使区、乡加强对交通不便的边远社的领导。中心社的群众曾经形容他们那里的状况是：“天高皇帝远，大事无人管；干部不来治，生产任意玩。”竞赛开始后，乡党支部批判了乡干部单纯怕麻烦、忽视改造落后乡、社的思想，指派了乡支部第一书记常驻中心社，乡长驻新发社，采取大鸣大放大辩论的方法，解决长期存在的一些问题，从而使社员的生产积极性空前高涨。
    在交通不便的边远地带，往往有些工作落后的乡社。据黄陂县的与邻县交界处八个乡的调查，粮食单位面积产量一般低于全县平均单产30％。黄陂县自从推广建设乡的办法后，已经初步改变这些地区的落后面貌。现在这个县邻近的红安、新洲、大悟、孝感等县毗联的乡、社，都开展了或明或暗的竞赛，有力地推动了生产。（附图片）
