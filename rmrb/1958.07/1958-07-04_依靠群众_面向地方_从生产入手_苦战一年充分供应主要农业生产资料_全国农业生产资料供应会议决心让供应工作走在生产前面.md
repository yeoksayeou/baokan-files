    Rely on the Masses  Orient Towards Localities  Start with Production
    Strive for a Year to Fully Supply Major Agricultural Production Materials
    National Agricultural Production Materials Supply Conference Resolves to Ensure Supply Work Precedes Production
    According to Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: The National Agricultural Production Materials Supply Conference, recently convened in Beijing by the Second Ministry of Commerce, resolved to rely on the masses, orient towards localities, start with production, and strive for a year to fully satisfy the needs of the agricultural sector for new-style farm tools, fertilizers, and pesticides.

    The conference decided that, in a short period, new-style and improved farm tools should be universally promoted and used to meet the rural areas' needs for complete mechanization or semi-mechanization of production, grain and feed processing, and transportation. Therefore, within a year, the national commercial departments will supply 33,870,000 units of various deep plows, rice transplanters, threshers, rice hullers, pesticide machinery, and various simple water-lifting tools, as well as over 20,000,000 units of various human-powered and animal-powered transportation tools. In order to meet the needs of agricultural cooperatives for large-scale fertilization, commercial departments, in cooperation with all parties, will vigorously organize the masses to develop various fertilizer sources. Within a year, it is planned to organize the masses to excavate and utilize nearly 200 million tons of various fertilizers, mainly developing the resource-rich sea fertilizer, phosphate rock powder, peat, locally produced chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, etc. The fertilizer effect of these fertilizers is approximately equivalent to 30 to 40 million tons of chemical fertilizers (ammonium sulfate, superphosphate). In order to cooperate with the agricultural departments in striving to basically eliminate various diseases and insect pests that harm crops within two to three years, commercial departments will also fully supply various pesticides. Under the current situation of insufficient supply of chemical pesticides, an important way is to mobilize the masses to vigorously produce indigenous pesticides, achieving self-production of pesticides in every township and cooperative. Within a year, the nation plans to supply various indigenous pesticides equivalent to nearly half of the amount of pesticides needed for comprehensive and thorough prevention and control next year. Coupled with the vigorous development of chemical pesticides, the needs can be largely met.

    This one-year hard-struggle plan was formulated after the commercial cadres attending the conference analyzed the future situation and characteristics of agricultural production materials supply work, criticized the right-leaning conservative ideology in past work, and exchanged advanced experiences. The conference believes that the agricultural production and construction upsurge this autumn and winter and next spring will be larger in scale, wider in scope, earlier in time, and more intense than last winter and this spring. In addition to continuing to build large-scale water conservancy projects, accumulate large amounts of fertilizer, and develop sideline production, it is also necessary to universally deep-plow the land, promote close planting, level the land, improve the soil, and deeply carry out the farm tool reform movement. All of these will inevitably require a large quantity, variety, high efficiency, and early timing of agricultural production materials. Therefore, the supply of production materials must precede agricultural production. Commercial departments at all levels should list the supply of production materials as the current central task, strengthen leadership, and comprehensively plan. Seize the autumn and winter, and seize this year for next year, and quickly prepare all materials in advance. The conference emphasized that to do a good job in the supply of agricultural production materials, it is necessary to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking and the dependent thinking of "looking upwards with both eyes and reaching outwards with both hands." In order to realize the plan to meet the needs of agricultural production in a short period, the conference requested that commercial departments in various places immediately assist agricultural cooperatives in manufacturing improved farm tools and indigenous chemical fertilizers and indigenous pesticides in large quantities. Commercial departments should frequently conduct technical exchanges with them, summarize and promote advanced experiences, provide samples and drawings, supply raw materials, tools, and provide necessary financial support. At the same time, commercial departments themselves should also run a number of small factories for manufacturing production materials, so as to obtain materials locally, produce locally, and ensure supply. The conference preliminarily determined that within a year, commercial departments nationwide will run independently or jointly with relevant departments more than 47,000 small factories and mines for fertilizers, pesticides, and farm tool repair.

    依靠群众  面向地方  从生产入手
    苦战一年充分供应主要农业生产资料
    全国农业生产资料供应会议决心让供应工作走在生产前面
    据新华社3日讯　第二商业部最近在北京召开的全国农业生产资料供应会议，决定依靠群众、面向地方、从生产入手，苦战一年，充分满足农业部门对新式农具、肥料、农药的需要。
    会议决定，在短期内要普遍推广、使用新式农具和改良农具，满足农村对生产、粮食饲料加工和运输等环节完全实行机械操作或半机械操作的需要。因此一年内全国商业部门将供应各种深耕犁、插秧机、脱粒机、打稻机、农药器械和各种简易提水工具三千三百八十七万部，各种人、畜力运输工具二千多万部。为满足农业社大量施肥的需要，商业部门与各方协作将大力组织群众开发各种肥源，一年内计划组织群众挖掘、利用各种肥料近二亿吨，其中主要是开发资源丰富的海肥、磷矿粉、草炭、土制化肥，细菌肥料等等，这些肥料的肥效约可抵化学肥料（硫酸铵、过磷酸钙）三千至四千万吨。为协同农业部门争取二、三年内基本消灭危害农作物的各种病虫害，商业部门还将充分供应各种农药，在当前化学农药供应不足的情况下，重要途径是发动群众大搞土农药，做到乡乡社社自制农药，一年内全国计划供应各种土农药相当于明年全面彻底防治需要农药量的将近一半，再加上大力发展化学农药，就可以大体上满足需要。
    这个苦战一年的规划是出席这次会议的商业工作干部分析了今后农业生产资料供应工作的形势和特点，批判了过去工作中的右倾保守思想，交流了先进经验以后制订出来的。会议认为今年秋冬和明春农业生产和建设高潮将比去冬今春规模更大、范围更广、时间更早、来势更猛，除了继续大兴水利、大量积肥和发展副业生产以外，还要普遍深翻土地、推广密植、平整土地、改良土壤、和深入开展农具改革运动，所有这些，对农业生产资料的需要，必然是数量大、品种多、效能高、时间早，因此生产资料供应工作必须走在农业生产的前面，各级商业部门应当把生产资料供应工作列为当前的中心任务，加强领导，全面规划。现在抓秋冬、今年抓明年，迅速提前做好一切物资准备工作。会议强调指出，要做好农业生产资料供应工作必须克服右倾保守思想和“两眼向上看、两手向外伸”的依赖思想。为实现短期内满足农业生产需要的规划，会议要求各地商业部门立即着手协助农业社大量制造改良农具和土化肥、土农药，商业部门要经常对他们进行技术交流、总结推广先进经验，提供样品、图纸，供应原料、工具和给予必要的资金支持；同时商业部门本身也要举办一批制造生产资料的小型工厂，以便就地取材、就地生产、保证供应。会议初步确定一年内全国商业部门将自行举办或与有关部门合办小型肥料、农药、农具修配等厂矿四万七千多个。
