    Smoke and Mirrors
    Currently, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the United States to build new military bases in other countries. An American colonel named Edwin Black recently pointed out in a book called "The Negotiator's Guide to the American Base Problem" that the reasons for this situation are: first, relevant countries are more sensitive to sovereignty issues than before; second, countries that provide bases bear significant risks. Therefore, he advocates proposing the slogan of "joint use" of bases with relevant countries to eliminate their concerns about sovereignty and risk issues.
    Since the base is on the territory of another country, "joint use" is actually just for the United States to use. Edwin Black is just playing a trick of smoke and mirrors here. However, the eyes of the people of all countries are discerning, and they have long seen from their own experience that American bases are the root cause of harming their national sovereignty and threatening their security. Therefore, Edwin Black's smoke and mirrors cannot deceive anyone at all, nor can it save the inevitable failure of the American base policy.

    障眼法
    目前，美国要在别的国家建筑新的军事基地一事已经越来越困难了。一个名叫埃德温·布莱克的美国上校最近在一本叫做“美国基地问题谈判者入门必读”的书中指出，造成这种情况的原因有：一，有关国家对主权问题都较前敏感；二，提供基地的国家要承担重大的风险。因此，他主张应该提出和有关国家“共同使用”基地的口号，来消除它们对主权和风险问题的担心。
    基地既然是在别国领土之上，那么“共同使用”实际上不过就是由美国使用罢了。埃德温·布莱克在这里不过是玩了一个障眼法。但是，各国人民的眼睛是雪亮的，他们从切身的经验中早已看出美国基地是损害他们国家主权和威胁他们的安全的根源。因而埃德温·布莱克的障眼法根本骗不了人，也不能挽救美国基地政策的必然失败。
