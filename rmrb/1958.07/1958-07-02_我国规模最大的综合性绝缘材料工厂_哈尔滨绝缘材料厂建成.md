Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 30th - On the eve of the Party's birthday "July 1st," China's first largest-scale modern comprehensive insulation material manufacturing factory, the Harbin Insulation Material Factory, has been completed and officially put into production.

Insulation material is an indispensable and important component of the electrical industry. In the past, China could only manufacture low-grade insulation materials, and the majority of high-grade insulation materials had to be imported, which could not meet the needs of the increasingly developing electrical industry. After the Harbin Insulation Material Factory is put into production, it can produce high-grade insulation materials for motors, electrical appliances, switches, instruments, and the aviation industry. It provides conditions for the future development of China's electrical industry.

The Harbin Insulation Material Factory officially started construction on July 1, 1956. Over the past two years, it has adopted the measure of simultaneous construction and production. It has not only completed the construction task as scheduled but also successfully trial-produced ninety-five varieties and one thousand seven hundred specifications of insulation materials. Some of the insulation materials produced by this factory are also sold to countries such as the Soviet Union, North Korea, Vietnam, Burma, and the United Kingdom.

This factory was designed by Chinese engineering and technical personnel themselves and assembled with modern equipment from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany. The vast majority of the equipment is highly mechanized and automated. The factory requires that in 1962, under existing equipment conditions, the annual output will reach 12,000 tons, exceeding the original design level by about two times.

    我国规模最大的综合性绝缘材料工厂
    哈尔滨绝缘材料厂建成
    据新华社哈尔滨30日电　在党的生日“七一”前夕，我国第一座规模最大的现代化综合性绝缘材料制造工厂——哈尔滨绝缘材料厂，已经建成并正式开工生产。
    绝缘材料是电气工业不可缺少的重要组成部分。过去，我国只能制造低级的绝缘材料，高级绝缘材料绝大部分要靠进口，满足不了电气工业日益发展的需要。哈尔滨绝缘材料厂投入生产后，可以生产电机、电器、开关、仪表和航空工业用的高级绝缘材料。它为我国今后电气工业的发展提供了条件。
    哈尔滨绝缘材料厂从1956年7月1日正式开工兴建，两年来采取边建设边生产的措施，不仅如期完成了建设任务，而且试制成功了九十五个品种、一千七百种规格的绝缘材料。这个厂生产的绝缘材料，有一部分还销到苏联、朝鲜、越南、缅甸、英国等国家。
    这个厂是我国工程技术人员自己设计，用苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国的现代化的设备装配起来的，绝大多数设备都是高度机械化、自动化的。这个厂要求在1962年在现有设备条件下，年产量达到一万二千吨，超过原设计水平的两倍左右。
