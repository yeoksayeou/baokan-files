    Deformed Art
    With the decline of the monopoly capitalist system, the bourgeois art of the United States is also becoming increasingly rotten, degenerate, and deformed.

    The New York "Museum of Modern Art," chaired by monopoly capitalist Nelson Rockefeller, recently selected eighty "masterpieces" of modern American painting to be sent to Europe for a year-long traveling exhibition. These paintings were so unsightly that even the art editor of the "New York Herald Tribune," after visiting its preview, couldn't help but publish the following comment in the newspaper:

    "A mess of paint, poured out of paint tubes or paint cans, spasmodically, monotonously, vaguely, and unpleasantly smeared on the canvas. The few 'moderate' works are just large pictures with two or three vertical lines painted on them, with the background almost blank..."

    According to the American "Time" magazine, these eighty paintings were exhibited in Milan, Italy, in June.

    At the World's Fair in Brussels, Belgium, the artworks in the American pavilion also aroused the indignation and ridicule of the vast audience.

    One day in mid-June, the situation at the Expo reached the White House. Republican Senator Bridges read a letter from Chicago lawyer Hayes Robertson to Eisenhower. The American president immediately flushed red and ordered the director of the United States Information Agency to leave for Brussels immediately to investigate the American art exhibition at the World's Fair. It turned out that Robertson had visited the Brussels Expo during a trip to Europe in May, and he described in his letter the embarrassment of the American art exhibits in front of the audience. The "New York Times" published an abstract of this letter on June 18:

    "At the front of the hall, there is a huge glass panel. On the panel is an etching, four feet high. The picture shows a man talking to a woman on the beach who is bare-chested and has an Indian headdress. Behind her, her tribesmen are roasting a person's thigh next to a rack.

    Walking along the right side of the hall, we saw a statue of Washington made of plastic, which was very poorly carved. There was also a carved eagle and a woodcut of an Indian. That's all the sculptures we found.

    "Then, we saw a set of oil paintings in the style of the Old Testament of Moses. The paintings made by ancient cave dwellers on the walls of caves are much better than these oil paintings.

    "Perhaps the intention of the art exhibition is to show our rapid progress in art. Because the next exhibit is a folding screen forty feet long and ten feet high. The screen depicts such beautiful girls: some have two eyes on one side of their foreheads...

    "Throughout Brussels, I have not heard any good reviews about the American exhibition. The twenty-four people who visited with me, including a Swiss guide, all felt disgusted and indignant." (Attached picture)

    畸形的艺术
    随着垄断资本主义制度的没落，美国的资产阶级艺术也日益腐烂、堕落和畸形化。
    以垄断资本家纳尔逊·洛克菲勒为董事长的纽约“现代艺术博物馆”，不久以前选择了八十幅美国现代绘画“杰作”，运往欧洲作为期一年的巡回展览。这些绘画是如此不堪令人入目，以致“纽约先驱论坛报”的艺术编辑在参观了它的预展以后，也忍不住在该报发表了这样的评论：
    “乱七八糟的颜料，从颜料管或颜料罐里倾倒出来，痉挛地、单调地、模糊地、令人难受地涂在画布上。少数‘有节制的’作品，不过是大的画面上，画着两三根垂直的线条，背景几乎是空白……。”
    据美国“时代”周刊报道，这八十幅绘画6月间已在意大利米兰展出。
    在比利时布鲁塞尔举行的世界博览会上，美国展览馆中的艺术作品也引起了广大观众的愤慨与嘲笑。
    6月中旬的一天，博览会上的情况传到了白宫。共和党参议员布里奇斯向艾森豪威尔宣读了芝加哥律师海斯·劳伯森的一封信。这位美国总统立刻脸红耳赤，命令美国新闻总署署长即日启程前往布鲁塞尔，调查世界博览会上的美国艺术展览。原来，劳伯森曾于5月间在欧洲旅行时参观过布鲁塞尔的博览会，他在信中描述了美国艺术展品在观众面前出丑的情况。6月18日的“纽约时报”发表了这封信件的摘要：
    “大厅的正面，有一块巨大的玻璃板。板上是一幅高达四呎的蚀刻画。画面上，有一个人在海滩与一个上身赤裸、头上有着印第安人发饰的妇女交谈。在后面，她的同部落的人，正在架子旁边烧烤着一个人的大腿。
    沿着大厅右边走去，我们看见用塑料制成的华盛顿雕像，雕刻得十分恶劣。还有一只雕刻的鹰和一个木刻的印第安人。这就是我们发现的全部雕刻品。
    “接着，我们看见了一套摩西老祖宗时代式的油画。古代穴居人在洞穴墙壁上所作的画，比这些油画还要高明得多了。
    “也许画展的意图是表现我们在艺术上的突飞猛进。因为下一个展品是一个四十呎长、十呎高的活动屏风。屏风上描绘着这样的一些美丽的姑娘：有的两只眼睛长在额头的一边……
    “在整个布鲁塞尔，我没有听见有关美国展览的好评。与我一同进行参观的二十四个人，其中包括一位瑞士籍的讲解员，大家都感到恶心与愤慨。”（附图片）
