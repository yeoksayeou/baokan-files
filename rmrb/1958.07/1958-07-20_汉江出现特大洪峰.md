Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 19th. Due to continuous rain in the upper reaches of the Han River in southern Shaanxi, the Han River has experienced its second extraordinary flood peak since the beginning of summer. On July 18th, this flood peak reached Xiangyang, Hubei Province, with the water level surging to 69.39 meters, 9 centimeters higher than the previous flood peak, and more than 1 meter higher than the highest water level since 1936. Because the previous flood had just receded, and the Han River's bottom water level was still high, this flood peak poses a greater threat to the middle and lower reaches. This morning, the flood peak just passed Xiangyang, but the water level in Xiantao and Hanchuan downstream is already close to the warning level. It is expected that when the flood peak arrives, the flood will be much higher than the previous water level.

Currently, hundreds of thousands of flood control forces in various parts of the Han River have been urgently deployed into the flood control battle. A large number of flood control materials have been rushed to the dikes overnight, and a number of critical dike sections are being reinforced.

    汉江出现特大洪峰
    据新华社武汉19日电　汉水上游陕西南部一带连日下雨，汉江出现入夏以来第二次特大洪峰。18日这股洪峰到达湖北省襄阳，水位猛涨到六九点三九公尺，比上次洪峰还高九公分，超过1936年以来最高水位一公尺多。由于上次洪水刚过不久，汉水底水位尚高，因此，这次洪峰出现对中、下游威胁较大。今天早上洪峰刚过襄阳，但下游仙桃、汉川一带已接近警戒水位。预计洪峰到达时，洪水将大大高出上次水位。
    现在沿汉江各地已有数十万防汛大军紧张投入防汛战斗。大批防汛器材已连夜赶运上堤，一批险要堤段正在加固。
