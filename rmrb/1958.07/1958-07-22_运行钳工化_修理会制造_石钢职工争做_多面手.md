Running Workers Learn Fitter Skills, Repair Workers Learn Manufacturing
Shijingshan Iron and Steel Workers Strive to Become "Multi-Talented"

(Our dispatch) This reporter Zhao Shenying reports: The "Multi-Talented" movement is rapidly unfolding in the production departments of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, following the direction of "Running Workers Learning Fitter Skills, Repair Workers Learning Manufacturing."

"Running Workers Learning Fitter Skills, Repair Workers Learning Manufacturing" means that running workers should learn to repair, and repair workers should learn to manufacture. Under this overall goal, each department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has put forward its own specific slogans for the current period. The Railway Transportation Department proposed: in terms of running, drivers should learn fitter skills (drivers learn to repair), shunting workers should learn driver skills (shunters, flagmen, and coupling workers learn to be stoker drivers), and switchmen should learn engineering (porters learn to maintain switches); in terms of repair, lathe operators should learn fitter skills, and merge occupations such as locomotive and freight car, electric welding and gas welding, forging and riveting, wood and tile, learning from each other. In addition to being responsible for medium and major repairs, repair workers should also manufacture electric locomotives. The Heating Workshop proposed: running workers handle minor repairs, participate in medium and major repairs; repair workers provide guidance, handling medium and major repairs as well as manufacturing, and trial-produce large boilers and steam engines.

The train crew groups of the Railway Transportation Department use their spare time and rest days (Sundays on which workers rotate shifts) to study repair theory and learn actual repair under the guidance of veteran repair workers, using a dead locomotive. They guarantee that they will take over the repair work of all thirteen locomotives before National Day ("Double Ten"). The "505" locomotive train crew group also proposed: working hard for seven rest days, they will take over the repair work of the locomotive by "August 1st." Each work section of the Heating Workshop organizes fitter groups according to working conditions, with running workers taking turns to work as fitters. Stokers in the steam section have already taken on the daily maintenance of the boilers, and the fitter groups have taken on all the minor repairs of the boilers during shutdowns. Many running workers in the Transportation Department and the Heating Workshop have now learned to use tools such as rivet heads, shovels, files, pliers, and wrenches.

"Running workers learning fitter skills" has first of all eliminated the phenomenon of idle work. In the past, minor machine problems had to wait for repair workers to come and fix them, but now the running workers can repair them themselves at any time. "Running workers learning fitter skills" can also save a large number of repair workers to manufacture machines. For example, after the train crew groups in the Transportation Department took over the locomotive repair work, forty-nine repair workers could be freed up to manufacture electric locomotives. "Running workers learning fitter skills" has also improved the relationship between running and repair. For example, repair workers in the Heating Workshop used to say that running workers were like mothers-in-law and repair workers were like daughters-in-law. The running workers could call at any time, and the repair workers had to come at any time. The running workers could pick on the repair workers' faults, and the repair workers could only put up with it; while the running workers often felt that the repair workers ignored them, which affected production. Now the contradictions have been unified, and there is no longer a distinction between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law.

Since the "Multi-Talented" movement started, the workers' morale has been high, and their thinking has been greatly liberated. Xu Dayong, who has been a stoker in the Heating Workshop for twelve years, used to think that he would spend his whole life guarding the boiler and ensuring safe production. Now he believes that on the basis of ensuring safe production, he can learn many other skills. Li Wenxiu, a locomotive driver in the Transportation Department, said: In the past, he thought that being a driver was the end of his career. If his eyes failed when he was fifty years old, he would find a place to stay, guarding the vehicles or looking after the tea stove. Now that he has learned repair, he feels that he can become a technician in the future, and even if he can't drive a train when he gets old, he can still become an engineer.

### 运行钳工化  修理会制造  石钢职工争做“多面手”

    运行钳工化  修理会制造
    石钢职工争做“多面手”
    本报讯  记者赵慎应报道：“多面手”运动在石景山钢铁厂生产部门沿着“运行钳工化、修理会制造”的方向，迅速开展起来。
      “运行钳工化、修理会制造”，就是运行工人要学会修理，修理工人要学会制造。在这个总目标下，石景山钢铁厂各部门都提出了自己当前的具体口号。铁道运输部提出：运行方面要司机钳工化（司机学会修理）、调车司机化（调车员、打旗工、挂钩工学会司炉司机）、转折工务化（搬运工学会维护道岔）；修理方面要车工钳工化，机车与货车、电焊与汽焊、锻与铆、木与瓦等工种合并，互相学习，修理工负责架修、中修、大修以外，还要制造电气机车。热力车间提出：运行包小修，参加中修、大修；修理做指导，中修大修兼制造，试制大型锅炉和蒸汽机。
    铁道运输部的包乘组利用每天业余时间和轮休日（工人轮换的星期日），一面学习检修理论，一面利用一台死机车，在老修理工人的指导下，学习实际检修。他们保证在“十一”前全部包下十三台机车的检修工作；“五○五”号机车包乘组还提出：苦战七个轮休，“八一”包下机车的检修工作。热力车间各工段根据工作条件组织钳工小组，由运行工人轮流换班当钳工。蒸汽工段的司炉已经担负起锅炉的日常维护工作，钳工小组全部包下了锅炉的停炉小修。运输部和热力车间的许多运行工人，现在都已学会使用铆头、铲子、锉刀、钳子、搬子等工具。
      “运行钳工化”首先消除了窝工现象，过去机器出了小毛病要等待修理工来修理，现在都由运行工自己随时修理了。“运行钳工化”还可以节省出大批修理工人去制造机器，仅运输部的包乘组包下机车检修后，就可以抽出四十九个检修工去制造电气机车。“运行钳工化”也改善了运行与修理之间的关系，如热力车间修理工人过去说运行工是婆婆，修理工是媳妇，运行工随时叫，修理工就得随时到，运行工可以挑剔修理工的毛病，修理工只有受气；而运行工也常常认为修理工不理他们，影响了生产。现在矛盾统一起来了，也没婆婆与媳妇的分别了。
    开展“多面手”以后，职工情绪很高，思想大为解放。在热力车间当了十二年司炉工的徐大用，过去认为一生就是守着锅炉，搞好安全生产算了，现在他认为在搞好安全生产的基础上，还可以学很多其他本领。运输部机车司机李文秀说：他过去想，当个司机，前途已经到头了。如果到五十岁时，眼睛不行了，就找个地方一呆，看守看守车辆，或者看看茶炉就完了。现在他学习了检修，感到将来还可以成为技术员，年老不能开火车了，也可当个工程师。
