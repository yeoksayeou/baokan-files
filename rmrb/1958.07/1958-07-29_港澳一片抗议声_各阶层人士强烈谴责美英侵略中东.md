Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 28th July. Protests by compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao against the US and British imperialist armed aggression in the Middle East have penetrated all levels of society.

　　Since the American and British invading forces entered Lebanon and Jordan, more than fifty labor unions in Hong Kong and Macao have held mass rallies, current affairs report meetings, and symposiums to strongly condemn the crimes of US and British imperialist armed aggression in the Middle East. Many workers at the gatherings combined their own experiences of the scourge of war to condemn the war provocations of US and British imperialism. Teachers, students, and staff in many schools in Hong Kong and Macao have gathered to protest against the US and British imperialist armed aggression in the Middle East. On July 23rd, the principals and academic affairs directors of thirty schools in Hong Kong issued a written statement after a gathering, saying: In order to protect the younger generation from the scourge of war, we firmly advocate that US and British troops immediately withdraw from the Middle East, and the flames of war in the Middle East should be extinguished immediately.

　　Nearly twenty chambers of commerce and various industry associations in Hong Kong and Macao have held gatherings to oppose the US and British aggression against the Middle East. Fifty-two well-known figures in the business community published talks in newspapers, all of whom demanded that the US and British aggressor troops immediately withdraw from the Middle East.

　　People from the cultural publishing and film circles in Hong Kong have also held gatherings for days. One hundred and twenty film workers wrote articles and published talks in newspapers, lodging serious protests against the crimes of US and British imperialism in invading the Middle East.
