Cui Xiyan returned to the Yingju Cooperative from Beijing, laden with honors.

The first question that the men and women, old and young, of the Yingju Cooperative asked Cui Xiyan after meeting him was always:

"Cooperative Chairman, did you see our Chairman Mao? Is he in good health?"

"Yes, I saw him! Chairman Mao talked to us and even invited us to dinner. He is in very good health!" Cui Xiyan became excited whenever he mentioned meeting Chairman Mao.

This news flowed through the people's hearts like a warm current, and their faces radiated glory and happiness. They eagerly demanded, "Chairman, tell us quickly, what instructions did Chairman Mao give us? Don't leave out a single detail."

		Going to Meet Chairman Mao

It was almost six o'clock in the afternoon of June 14th when Cui Xiyan received the news that he was going to meet Chairman Mao. He was so happy that he didn't know what to do. He thought, under the leadership and care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our cooperative has changed its appearance after two years of hard work and is advancing towards the happy socialist road. Not long ago, Chairman Mao introduced our cooperative to the people of the whole country, and now he is going to personally receive us. What a great encouragement this is to us! I must carefully remember every word of Chairman Mao and tell all the members when I return, and always follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao.

Cui Xiyan, with a feeling of joy and a little nervousness, got into the car with Xiong Tianjing, Director of the Rural Relief Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Shi Desheng, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Henan Province, and Zhang Jiannan, County Head of Fengqiu County, to go to Zhongnanhai to meet Chairman Mao.

The car entered the vermilion gate of Zhongnanhai and drove slowly along the lakeside. Soon, it stopped in front of a gate. Cui Xiyan got out of the car and looked up. The paint on this gate had peeled off after years of wind and rain, making it look very old. At that moment, the heart of this farmer from the disaster area was indescribable. He thought, our great leader spends his energy day and night, year after year, for the happiness of 600 million people, yet he himself lives a frugal life in such an old and simple courtyard.

Stepping through this peeling paint gate, past a pool, a white cloth awning appeared in front. Here, a person was buried in his desk looking at something. As soon as Cui Xiyan saw that familiar face, he couldn't help but shout "Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao heard the shout, looked up, and saw that his guests had arrived. He immediately stood up, shook hands with everyone with a smile, asked everyone's names one by one, and then invited everyone to sit down, poured tea and offered cigarettes.

Cui Xiyan, sitting tightly next to Chairman Mao, had never been so excited and agitated.

In those years when floods swallowed all the crops, in those days when difficulties were overwhelming, Cui Xiyan felt strength all over his body whenever he thought of the Party and Chairman Mao. So, he led the members again and again to bravely fight against disasters and difficulties. After several years of effort, they finally overcame the disasters and changed the past. How much he wanted to see Chairman Mao in person and report the situation of their cooperative to Chairman Mao! However, today he became a guest in Chairman Mao's home.

Sitting in front of Chairman Mao, Cui Xiyan's thoughts and feelings churned like the sea. He stared at Chairman Mao. A burly body, black oily hair, kind eyes, rosy complexion, and excellent health.

	Chairman Praises the Report Introducing Yingju Cooperative

Chairman Mao first asked Zhang Jiannan, the County Head of Fengqiu County:

"Who wrote the report on Yingju Cooperative?"

As soon as Zhang Jiannan heard this, he knew that Chairman Mao was referring to the report "A Cooperative That Changed Its Appearance After Two Years of Hard Work" published in the "Red Flag" magazine. He immediately told Chairman Mao: "It was written by Comrade Han Hongxu, the First Secretary of the Fengqiu County Party Committee."

"That report was written very well." Chairman Mao also asked: "How much schooling did Comrade Han Hongxu receive?"

"He graduated from high primary school before the war."

Chairman Mao praised, "Not easy, not easy, it's really not easy to write such a good report with a high primary school education!"

Chairman Mao also asked about Han Hongxu's work situation, and Zhang Jiannan gave Chairman Mao a detailed introduction.

"Why is your cooperative called Yingju Cooperative?" Chairman Mao began an interesting conversation with Cui Xiyan.

"Our village produced a literary scholar in the past. This scholar was different from ordinary scholars. He did not exploit people and maintained his life by self-reliance. Our cooperative also relies on self-reliance to carry out production and overcome famine, so it is called Yingju Cooperative."

Chairman Mao laughed when he heard this, "Very interesting!" He said, "You used to be a poor cooperative, but after several years of effort, you have changed your appearance. In a few more years, you will be even better!"

"These achievements are due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Everyone in our cooperative is very grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" Cui Xiyan said.

Chairman Mao shook his head and said, "No, no, this is due to the efforts of all the members of your cooperative that you have achieved such great achievements. To do a good job in the country, we must rely on the efforts of the 600 million people of the country."

	Reporting to the Chairman on Favorable Conditions for Increased Production

Chairman Mao also asked: "How many catties of wheat did Yingju Cooperative harvest per mu?"

"The estimated yield is 150 catties per mu."

After Chairman Mao calculated for a moment, he said, "Your plan is to produce 800 catties per mu, but wheat can only be harvested at 150 catties per mu. There are still more than 600 catties to go. Are you confident in achieving a yield of 800 catties per mu this year?"

"I am completely confident, and I will strive to exceed it." Cui Xiyan replied with confidence.

"What are the favorable conditions that guarantee increased production?" Chairman Mao asked further.

"First, our cooperative has realized water conservancy. From last winter to this spring, we completed 80,000 cubic meters of water conservancy projects, built 110 irrigation canals, and can draw water from the Yellow River to irrigate all the land in the cooperative."

"Yes, that counts as one condition." Chairman Mao wrote it down.

"Second, fertilizer accumulation has greatly increased this year. In the past, we only applied 2,000 catties of fertilizer per mu, but this year we will apply 40,000 catties of fertilizer per mu."

"Another one." Chairman Mao wrote it down again.

"Third, we have changed low-yield crops to high-yield crops. This year, our cooperative replanted 2,830 mu of rice, 800 mu of sweet potatoes, 200 mu of cotton, 186 mu of miscellaneous grains, and 50 mu of peanuts."

Chairman Mao said: "Sweet potatoes are delicious, I love to eat them. It is best to allocate some sweet potatoes to everyone in the grain ration in the future."

Cui Xiyan continued:

"Fourth, everyone in our cooperative has a lot of energy. Although our life is not yet prosperous, everyone realizes that to change the poor face, we must work harder."

"This is a very important condition." Chairman Mao praised.

"There is also a fifth condition, which is also the most important condition," Cui Xiyan said excitedly, "Chairman Mao recently introduced our cooperative to the people of the whole country in the 'Red Flag' magazine. Today, Chairman Mao personally received us and gave us valuable instructions. Once I convey it back, Chairman Mao's instructions will become our strength to increase production, and the energy of all members will be greater, and the yield per mu will be higher!"

Chairman Mao smiled happily and said to Cui Xiyan, "Good! Your five conditions are very correct!"

Cui Xiyan's nervousness when he first arrived had disappeared unconsciously. He felt that being with Chairman Mao was like being at home. The approachable demeanor of our great leader made him feel as warm and close as if he had met relatives who had been separated for many years.

"We will definitely guarantee a yield of 800 catties per mu, and strive to exceed it." Cui Xiyan once again made a guarantee to Chairman Mao.

At this time, Zhang Jiannan, the County Head of Fengqiu County, interjected and said, "Now the masses of Yingju Cooperative have raised the target of yield per mu to guarantee 1,000 catties and strive to reach 1,200 catties!"

Chairman Mao said with a smile, "Even 800 catties is a fourfold increase!" "Be modest and prudent, let the red flag fly higher and higher!"

Chairman Mao, with a cigarette lit, said kindly to Cui Xiyan: "We must be modest and prudent, cadres and the masses must unite closely, and the red flag must always be planted in your cooperative, so that the red flag flies higher and higher."

Cui Xiyan was so moved by Chairman Mao's teachings that he couldn't speak for a moment. He just said, "We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

"Is the transportation of your cooperative convenient?" Chairman Mao asked Cui Xiyan again.

"The transportation is very convenient. After getting off the train in Xinxiang, there is a direct bus to our cooperative, and the surrounding roads are also accessible in all directions."

At this time, Chairman Mao talked with Xiong Tianjing, Director of the Rural Relief Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Shi Desheng, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Henan Province, about civil affairs work. Xiong Tianjing and Shi Desheng told Chairman Mao about the content of civil affairs work one by one, totaling more than 20 kinds.

"So many, can you finish them?"

"In the province, in addition to these tasks, we also complete other tasks assigned to us by the Party." Shi Desheng said.

"In the past, some people raised objections, saying that civil affairs work has too many threads and is not easy to do. Minister Xie Juezai criticized this view, saying that civil affairs work is doing people's work. We must take care of things that other departments do not care about." Xiong Tianjing said.

"What is your opinion?" Chairman Mao asked Xiong Tianjing.

"I agree with Minister Xie's opinion. As long as the Party assigns us a task, we should strive to complete it."

"That's right, civil affairs work is doing people's work, don't be afraid of trouble." Chairman Mao laughed happily.

While Chairman Mao was talking with Xiong Tianjing and Shi Desheng, Cui Xiyan carefully looked at the furnishings in this white cloth awning. Here, there were six somewhat old rattan chairs, a table covered with a layer of white cloth, with a stack of books and newspapers on it, and a bed placed on one side. Everything was so simple. The simple life of our great leader once again left a deep impression on this hardworking farmer. What moved Cui Xiyan even more was Chairman Mao's serious working style. During the conversation, Chairman Mao always held a pencil and wrote down everyone's words word by word. "The total output of summer harvest crops in Henan Province this year is more than 20 billion catties, more than double the increase compared to last year. This is a very remarkable thing." A pleasant smile appeared on Chairman Mao's kind face.

"These are the achievements made by Chairman Mao leading the people of the whole country in the great leap forward in production." Shi Desheng, Zhang Jiannan, and Cui Xiyan said in unison.

However, Chairman Mao was so modest that he said repeatedly: "No, no, from the national perspective, it is the power of 600 million people. From the perspective of a cooperative, it is the result of the hard work of all the members."

Chairman Mao also described a bright future of happy life for the people present: Before long, the average annual grain output per person in the country will be 1,000 catties (600 catties for human consumption, and the rest for reserve grain, seeds, and pig feed), 100 catties of pork, 20 catties of oil, and 20 catties of cotton. After another period of time, the average annual grain output per person will be 1,500 catties. In this way, the living standards of the people of the whole country will be greatly improved.

"Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the whole country will surely achieve such a life!" After listening to Chairman Mao's words, Cui Xiyan said excitedly.

	Eating with Chairman Mao

At this time, a comrade came in and said to Chairman Mao: "Dinner is ready!"

Two hours had already passed. As soon as they heard that dinner was ready, Xiong Tianjing, Shi Desheng, Zhang Jiannan, and Cui Xiyan stood up to say goodbye.

Chairman Mao quickly said: "Don't go! I'm inviting you to have dinner together!"

Everyone was overjoyed to hear that Chairman Mao was inviting them to dinner. Chairman Mao led everyone into a small dining room. At this time, the food had already been moved to the table.

There were four people waiting in the dining room. Chairman Mao introduced the guests one by one. Chairman Mao pointed to two young girls and said: "These are my daughters, they are both studying." Then he pointed to the young man and said: "This is my nephew, the child of my younger brother Mao Zemin. Two of our three brothers were killed by the Kuomintang!" Finally, introducing the female comrade, Chairman Mao said with a smile: "She is my lover."

Next, Chairman Mao introduced the guests one by one. When introducing Cui Xiyan, Chairman Mao said with particular pleasure: "He is Comrade Cui Xiyan, the chairman of the Yingju Cooperative that I introduced in the 'Red Flag' magazine."

During the meal, Cui Xiyan seemed a little cramped again. Chairman Mao and his lover Comrade Jiang Qing quickly noticed this. They would put dishes into Cui Xiyan's bowl from time to time, and add rice and soup for Cui Xiyan. Cui Xiyan was so moved that he didn't know what to do. He ate very well at this meal.

Cui Xiyan especially noticed that Chairman Mao rarely ate vegetables. He ate a kind of chili that was smaller than green beans and a plate of bitter melon, and the rice was also made of ordinary coarse rice. Chairman Mao's frugal life once again moved Cui Xiyan.

After eating, Chairman Mao asked people to bring out a plate of apples and asked the guests to eat them. But no one ate them. Cui Xiyan wanted to take an apple back to Yingju Cooperative as a souvenir, but he was embarrassed to do so.

Chairman Mao seemed to see through the farmer's thoughts. He smiled and said, "If you don't eat it, you can take it away!"

Cui Xiyan was extremely happy, he reached out and took a big apple and put it in his bag.

Two and a half hours later, the guests said goodbye. Chairman Mao and his family all came out to see the guests off. They sent them off for a long way, but Chairman Mao and his family were still reluctant to go back. The guests said, "If Chairman Mao doesn't go back, we won't leave either!" Chairman Mao then stopped. When the guests looked back after walking a long way, they found that Chairman Mao and his family were still standing there watching them. So, the guests stopped again and were reluctant to leave. Only then did Chairman Mao slowly go home.

After returning to the hotel, Cui Xiyan didn't sleep well all night. What was this farmer who came from the old society thinking? He thought a lot. He thought: He, an ordinary farmer, could be a guest in Chairman Mao's home. This is not only his personal glory, but also the glory of all the members of Yingju Cooperative, and also the glory of the 500 million peasant brothers in the country! He wished he could grow two wings and immediately fly to Yingju Cooperative, fly to every corner of the countryside in the country, and tell this happy experience to all the members of Yingju Cooperative and the 500 million peasant brothers in the country.

Cui Xiyan recounted endlessly, and he became happier as he spoke. People listened, listened, and became more and more excited. It was as if Chairman Mao had not only received Cui Xiyan, but had received everyone in Yingju Cooperative. Now, more than 2,000 mu of the 2,830 mu of rice that the entire cooperative replanted have been transplanted. After two days and nights of hard work by all the members, they will have to work hard for another three days and nights to finally complete the rice transplanting work for all the paddy fields. At the same time, 500 mu of sweet potatoes have also begun to be planted. Cui Xiyan, Cui Ruogu, all the cooperative cadres, and all the cooperative members are working hard to realize their common wish, which is: to never disappoint Chairman Mao's teachings, to work hard, and strive to report the good news to Chairman Mao at the National Agricultural Socialist Construction Advanced Unit Representative Conference!

    幸福的会见  巨大的鼓舞
    ——记毛主席接见河南封丘县应举农业社社长崔希彦
    新华社记者　于民生
    崔希彦满载盛誉从北京回到了应举社。
    应举社的男女老少，同崔希彦见面后的第一句话总是先问：
    “社长，你看到咱们的毛主席没有？他老人家的身体可好？”
    “见到啦，见到啦！毛主席同我们谈了话，还请我们吃了饭。他老人家的身体可好啦！”一提见到毛主席，崔希彦就兴奋起来。
    这消息就像一股暖流一样通过人们的心，人们的脸上放射出光荣和幸福的光彩。他们迫不及待地要求说：“社长，快说说，毛主席是怎样指示我们的？别漏掉一个细节。”
             ×××
          去会见毛主席
    那是6月14日下午快六点钟的时候，崔希彦得到了要去会见毛主席的消息。他高兴得不知道怎样作才好。他想，我们的合作社在党中央和毛主席的领导和关怀下，经过两年的苦战改变了面貌，正在向着幸福的社会主义大道前进。不久前毛主席向全国人民介绍了我们的合作社，现在又要亲自接见我们了，这对我们是多么大的鼓舞啊！我一定要好好记下毛主席的每一句话，回去告诉全体社员，永远照着毛主席所指的方向走。
    崔希彦就是怀着既高兴又有点紧张的心情，同内务部农村救济司司长熊天荆，河南省民政厅厅长施德生，封丘县县长张剑南一起，坐上汽车去中南海会见毛主席的。
    汽车进了中南海的朱漆大门，沿着湖畔缓缓地向前行驶着，不久就在一座大门前停了下来。崔希彦走下汽车抬头一看，这座大门经过历年风雨吹打，上面的油漆已经斑剥脱落，显得很陈旧了。在这一霎那，这个来自灾区的农民的心情是难以形容的。他想，我们的伟大领袖，为了六亿人民的幸福，成年累月，日日夜夜地耗费着心血，然而他自己，却在这样一个陈旧、朴素的门庭里过着俭朴的生活。
    迈进这座油漆剥落的大门，绕过一个水池，前面出现了一个白布篷，这里有一个人埋头案上看东西。崔希彦一看到那熟悉的面孔，就禁不住喊起“毛主席”来。
    毛主席听见这喊声抬头一看，发现是他的客人来了，马上站起来，微笑着同大家握手，一一问了大家的名字，然后请大家坐下，给大家倒茶递烟。
    紧坐在毛主席旁边的崔希彦，从来也没有像现在这样兴奋和激动。
    在那些洪水吞没了一切庄稼的年月里，在那些困难压得喘不过气来的日子里，崔希彦一想起了党和毛主席，就浑身都是力量，于是他一次又一次地领导社员们勇敢地同灾害和困难作着顽强的斗争。经过几年的努力，终于战胜了灾害，改变了过去的面貌。他是多么想亲自看一看毛主席，把他们合作社的情况报告给毛主席啊！然而，他今天在毛主席家里作起客来了。
    坐在毛主席的面前，崔希彦的思想感情像海水一样地翻滚着。他目不转睛地打量着毛主席。魁梧的身体，黑油油的头发，和悦的眼光，红润的脸色，身体健康极了。
    主席称赞介绍应举社的报告
    毛主席首先问封丘县县长张剑南：
    “应举社的那篇报告是谁写的？”
    张剑南一听就知道毛主席指的是“红旗”杂志上发表的那篇“一个苦战二年改变了面貌的合作社”的报告。他马上告诉毛主席：“是中共封丘县委第一书记韩洪绪同志写的。”
    “那篇报告写得很好。”毛主席还问：“韩洪绪同志读了多少书？”
    “战前在高小毕业。”
    毛主席就称赞说：“不容易，不容易，高小程度就能写出这样好的报告，真不容易！”
    毛主席又问了韩洪绪工作的情况，张剑南都一一向毛主席作了介绍。
    “你们的合作社，为什么叫应举社？”毛主席同崔希彦开始了有趣的谈话。
    “我们村里过去出了一名文举，这个举人，同一般的举人不一样，他不剥削人，靠自力更生维持生活。我们的合作社也是依靠自力更生进行生产渡荒的，所以就叫应举社。”
    毛主席听得笑了起来，“很有意思！”他说：“你们过去是一个穷社，经过几年的努力就改变了面貌，再过几年你们还会更好！”
    “这些成绩都是由于有党中央和毛主席的正确领导才取得的。我们合作社的每一个人都非常感谢共产党，感谢毛主席！”崔希彦说。
    毛主席摇摇手说：“不，不，这是由于你们合作社全体社员的努力，才取得了这样大的成绩。全国的事情要办好，就要依靠全国六亿人民的努力。”
    向主席报告增产的有利条件
    毛主席又问：“应举社的小麦每亩收了多少斤？”
    “估产是每亩一百五十斤。”
    毛主席算了一下以后说：“你们计划每亩产八百斤，小麦每亩只能收一百五十斤，还有六百多斤，今年是不是有把握实现亩产八百斤？”
    “完全有把握，而且争取超过。”崔希彦满怀信心地回答。
    “都有那些保证增产的有利条件？”毛主席又进一步问。
    “第一，我们合作社已经实现了水利化。从去年冬天到今年春天，我们完成了八万土方的水利工程，修了一百一十条灌溉渠道，能引黄河的水，浇全社所有的土地。”
    “对，算一个条件。”毛主席用笔记下来。
    “第二，今年积肥大量增加，过去每亩地只施肥两千斤，今年每亩地要施肥四万斤。”
    “又是一条。”毛主席又记下来。
    “第三，把低产作物，改为高产作物。今年我们社改种二千八百三十亩水稻，种八百亩红薯，二百亩棉花，一百八十六亩杂粮，五十亩花生。”
    毛主席说：“红薯很好吃，我很爱吃，最好以后每人在粮食中配给一部分红薯。”
    崔希彦接着说：
    “第四，我们合作社的每一个人干劲都很大。我们的生活现在虽然还不富裕，但每个人都认识到，要改变穷面貌，就要加油干。”
    “这是很重要的一个条件。”毛主席称赞说。
    “还有第五个条件，也是最重要的一个条件”，崔希彦激动地说：“毛主席不久前在
  ‘红旗’杂志上向全国人民介绍了我们的社，今天毛主席又亲自接见我们，给了我们宝贵的指示，我回去一传达，毛主席的指示就会变成我们增产的力量，全体社员的干劲就会更大，亩产就会更提高！”
    毛主席很高兴地笑着对崔希彦说：“好哇！你们这五个条件很对呀！”
    崔希彦刚来时那种紧张的心情，已经不知不觉地消除了。他感到在毛主席这里，就跟在自己家里一样。我们伟大的领袖平易近人的风度，使他感到就好像会见了离别多年的亲人那样的温暖和亲近。
    “一定保证亩产八百斤，并且争取超过。”崔希彦又一次向毛主席提出了保证。
    这时封丘县县长张剑南插进来说：“现在应举社的群众已经把亩产指标提高到保证一千斤，争取达到一千二百斤了！”
    毛主席笑着说：“就是八百斤，也翻了四番了！”“戒骄戒躁，让红旗越插越高！”
    燃着一支香烟，毛主席亲切地对崔希彦说：“要戒骄戒躁，干部和群众要紧密地团结，要把红旗永远插在你们社里，让红旗越插越高”。
    崔希彦听着毛主席的教导，激动得一时说不出话来。他只是说：“我们一定要牢牢记住毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示去作。”
    “你们合作社的交通方便不方便？”毛主席又问崔希彦。
    “交通很方便，在新乡下火车以后，有汽车直通我们的合作社，周围的公路也四通八达。”
    这时，毛主席和内务部农村救济司司长熊天荆、河南省民政厅厅长施德生谈起了民政工作，熊天荆和施德生把民政工作的内容一一讲给毛主席听，共有二十多种。
    “这么多，能作完吗？”
    “在省里，除这些工作外，党交给我们的其他工作，我们同样是完成的。”施德生说。
    “过去有人提意见，说民政工作头绪多不好作。谢觉哉部长批判了这种意见，他说，民政工作就是作人的工作，别的部门不管的事情，我们都要管起来。”熊天荆说。
    “你的意见呢？”毛主席问熊天荆。
    “我同意谢部长的意见，只要是党交给我们的任务，我们就应该努力去完成。”
    “对了，民政工作就是作人的工作，不要怕麻烦。”毛主席乐得笑开了。
    趁毛主席和熊天荆、施德生谈话的时候，崔希彦仔细地打量了一下这个白布篷里的摆设。这里，有六把已经有些旧的藤椅子，一张桌子罩着一层白布，上面放着一叠书报，一张床安放在一边，一切都是那样俭朴。我们伟大领袖那种朴素的生活再一次给这位勤劳的农民留下了深刻的印象。更使崔希彦感动的，是毛主席那认真的工作作风，在谈话的过程中，毛主席一直拿着铅笔，一个字一个字地把大家的话都记下来。“河南省今年夏收作物总产量二百多亿斤，比去年增产一倍多，这是一件很了不起的事情。”毛主席的慈祥的脸上呈现出愉快的笑容。
    “这都是毛主席领导全国人民生产大跃进取得的成绩。”施德生、张剑南和崔希彦三人异口同声地说。
    然而，毛主席却是那样地虚怀若谷，他连声说：“不，不，从全国来说，是六亿人民的力量，从一个合作社来说，是全体社员大干苦战取得的。”
    毛主席又向在座的人描绘了一幅幸福的生活远景：不要很久，全国每人每年就可以平均有粮食一千斤（其中人吃六百斤，其他留作储备粮、种籽和喂猪），一百斤猪肉，二十斤油，二十斤棉花。再过一个时间，每人每年要平均有一千五百斤粮食。这样全国人民的生活水平就会大大提高了。
    “在党和毛主席的领导下，全国一定会达到这样的生活！”听了毛主席的话以后，崔希彦兴奋而又激动地说。
        和毛主席一起吃饭
    这时候，有一位同志走进来，对毛主席说：“吃饭了！”
    时间已经过了两个小时。一听说吃饭了，熊天荆、施德生、张剑南和崔希彦，就站起来准备告辞。
    毛主席连忙说：“别走啊！就是请你们一起来吃晚饭的！”
    大家一听毛主席要请吃饭，就乐开了，真是高兴上更加高兴。毛主席领着大家一起走进了一个小餐厅。这时，饭菜已经搬到桌上放好了。
    在餐厅里有四个人在那等候着，毛主席向客人们一一作了介绍。毛主席指着两个年青的姑娘说：“这是我的女儿，她们都在读书。”又指着那个青年说：“这是我的侄子，是我弟弟毛泽民的孩子，我们弟兄三个，有两个被国民党杀害了！”最后介绍到那位女同志，毛主席笑着说：“她就是我的爱人。”
    接着，毛主席又把客人一一作了介绍。介绍崔希彦的时候，毛主席特别高兴地说：“他就是我在‘红旗’杂志上介绍的那个合作社——应举社的社长崔希彦同志。”
    吃饭的时候，崔希彦又显得有些侷促了。毛主席和他的爱人江青同志很快就发现了这一点，他们不时地把菜挟到崔希彦的碗里，并且为崔希彦添饭添汤。崔希彦感动得简直不知道怎样作才好，这一顿饭他吃得特别饱。
    崔希彦特别注意到，毛主席很少吃菜，他吃的是一种比青豆角还小的辣椒和一盘苦瓜，饭也是普通粗米做的。毛主席这种节俭的生活，再一次感动了崔希彦。
    吃了饭以后，毛主席又叫人拿出了一盘苹果请客人吃。可是谁也没有吃。崔希彦很想拿一个苹果带回应举社作纪念，但是又不好意思这样做。
    毛主席好像看透了这位农民的心思，他笑笑说：“不吃，带走也可以！”
    崔希彦高兴极了，他伸手就拿了一个大苹果装到袋子里。
    两个半小时以后，客人们告辞了。毛主席一家人都出来为客人们送行。送了很远，毛主席和他的一家人还不肯回去。客人们说：“毛主席不回去，我们也不走了！”毛主席这才停住了脚步。当客人们走了很远回头一看时，发现毛主席和他的一家人还在那里望着他们。于是，客人们又停下来不肯走了。毛主席这才缓步回家了。
    回到旅馆以后，崔希彦一夜也没有好好睡觉。这位从旧社会走过来的农民在想些什么呢？他想得很多很多。他想：他，一个普通的农民能在毛主席家里作客，这不仅是他个人的光荣，而且是应举社全体社员的光荣，同时也是全国五亿农民兄弟的光荣！他恨不得生出两只翅膀，立刻飞到应举社，飞到全国农村的每一个角落，把这幸福的经历告诉应举社全体社员们，告诉全国的五亿农民兄弟。
            ×××
    崔希彦滔滔不绝地回述着，他越说越高兴。人们听着，听着，越听越兴奋。就像毛主席不只是接见崔希彦，而是接见了应举社的每一个人。现在，全社改种的二千八百三十亩水稻，已完成了两千多亩的插秧工作。社员在全体大动员苦战了两昼夜之后，还要再苦战三昼夜，最后完成全部稻田的插秧工作。同时，五百亩红薯也已经开始栽种，崔希彦、崔若谷和全体社干部、全体社员，正在为实现他们的共同心愿而奋斗，这就是：决不辜负毛主席的教导，一定努力干，争取到全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议上向毛主席报喜！
