Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The friendly weightlifting match between the Chinese and the United Arab Republic teams, which began in the Beijing Gymnasium on the evening of the 22nd, concluded at 2:15 AM on the 23rd. In the intense competition across seven weight classes lasting over six and a half hours, Chinese athletes secured first place in the flyweight, lightweight, middleweight, light-heavyweight, and light-heavyweight categories. Furthermore, they broke four national records (one total score, three individual lifts) in the light-heavyweight class.

In the competition of the last four weight classes, which continued at 10 PM on the 22nd, Chinese middleweight athlete Zhu Hongquan and his opponent Mohamed Goushed engaged in fierce competition. Zhu Hongquan pressed 112.5 kg and snatched 105 kg, while Goushed pressed 107.5 kg and snatched 112.5 kg. In the clean and jerk, which determined the winner, Goushed successfully jerked 135 kg on his first attempt, while Zhu Hongquan jerked 140 kg, exceeding his opponent by 2.5 kg. On his second attempt, Goushed jerked 140 kg, putting him 2.5 kg ahead again. On his third attempt, Goushed failed to jerk 142.5 kg, and Zhu Hongquan tenaciously jerked 145 kg, winning a hard-fought tug-of-war.

Zhao Qingkui achieved excellent results in the light-heavyweight competition. His press of 130 kg exceeded the national record by 2.5 kg, and his snatch of 132.5 kg exceeded the national record by 10 kg. On his third snatch attempt, he requested 138 kg, exceeding the world record of American athlete Jim George by 0.5 kg. Zhao Qingkui completed the snatch, but unfortunately failed to hold the lifted barbell for more than one second, resulting in a failed attempt, which caused a great deal of regret among the six thousand spectators.

Zhao Qingkui's clean and jerk result was 170 kg, and his total score was 432.5 kg, both breaking national records. After Zhao Qingkui successfully jerked 170 kg on his second attempt, he then attempted 176.5 kg on his third attempt, aiming for the world record of 176 kg. It seemed Zhao Qingkui effortlessly lifted the barbell and had already raised it above his forehead, but due to a loss of balance, the barbell fell. His fourth attempt at 176.5 kg was also unsuccessful.

Zhao Qingkui's opponent, Abdul Karim, achieved a press of 120 kg, but failed all three snatch attempts, resulting in no total score.

Li Baiyu won first place in the light-heavyweight competition with a total score of 407.5 kg. His opponent, Hamid El Masri, achieved a score of 387.5 kg. Li Baiyu's snatch tied the national record (122.5 kg).

Hassan Bayleram won the heavyweight championship with a total score of 375 kg. Chang Guanqun pressed 130 kg and snatched 100 kg, but failed all three clean and jerk attempts.

After the competition, Ma Yuehan, Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation, presented the awards. (See attached picture)

    我举重队五比二胜阿联队
    赵庆奎创轻重量级四项全国新纪录
    据新华社23日讯　22日傍晚开始在北京体育馆举行的中国、阿拉伯联合共和国举重队友谊比赛，进行到23日晨两点一刻全部结束。在历时六个半多小时的七个等级的紧张比赛中，中国运动员分别获得了最轻量级、轻量级、中量级、轻重量级、次重量级的第一名。并且打破了轻重量级四个项目（一个总成绩、三个单项）的全国纪录。
    在22日二十三时继续进行的后四个等级的比赛中，我国中量级选手朱鸿全和他的对手穆罕默德·高谢德展开了激烈的竞争。朱鸿全推举了一百一十二点五，抓举了一百零五公斤，高谢德推一百零七点五，抓一百一十二点五公斤。在决定胜负的挺举中，高谢德第一次挺起了一百三十五公斤，朱鸿全举起一百四十公斤，超出他的对手二点五公斤，第二次高谢德举起了一百四十公斤，朱鸿全第二次一百四十五公斤失败，这样高谢德又领先了二点五公斤。第三次高谢德举一百四十二点五公斤失败，朱鸿全顽强地举起一百四十五公斤，赢得了一场艰巨的拉锯战。
    赵庆奎在轻重量级比赛中，创造了优异的成绩。他的推举一百三十公斤超出了全国纪录二点五公斤，抓举一百三十二点五公斤超出了全国纪录十公斤。他在第三次试举时要求抓一百三十八公斤，超出了美国选手吉姆·乔治的世界纪录零点五公斤。赵庆奎已经完成了抓举动作，可惜没有能把举起的杠铃保持一秒钟以上，被判失败，引起六千观众大声惋惜。
    赵庆奎的挺举成绩是一百七十公斤，总成绩四百三十二点五公斤，都打破了全国纪录。在赵庆奎第二次试举时挺举起一百七十公斤以后，接着第三次试举一百七十六点五公斤，冲击一百七十六公斤的世界纪录。眼看赵庆奎轻松地拉起了杠铃，并且将杠铃已经挺上了额前上方，但由于重心不稳，杠铃掉了下来。以后第四次试举一百七十六点五公斤又未成。
    赵庆奎的对手阿卜杜勒·卡里姆的推举成绩是一百二十公斤，抓举三次失败，没有总成绩。
    李白玉以四百零七点五公斤的总成绩赢得了次重量级比赛的第一名。他的对手哈密德·爱尔·马斯利的成绩是三百八十七点五公斤。李白玉的抓举平全国纪录（一百二十二点五公斤）。
    哈森·贝勒姆赢得重量级冠军的总成绩是三百七十五公斤。常冠群推了一百三十公斤，抓一百公斤，但挺举三次都失败了。
