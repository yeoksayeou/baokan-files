Xinhua News Agency, July 28th -- General Xu Guangda, Commander of the Armored Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said today at the report of victory and comparison meeting on the overall Great Leap Forward in combat training and various tasks of the Armored Corps that the aggression of the United States and British imperialism in the Middle East has thoroughly exposed the true face of its imperialist robbers. We do not want war, but we are not afraid if imperialism wants to launch a war. All comrades in the army must be fully ideologically prepared and maintain high vigilance.
    The Armored Corps' report of victory and comparison meeting lasted six days and closed today. Attending the meeting were 387 leading cadres of tank and mechanized divisions and regiments, as well as representatives of advanced units and advanced individuals.
    This was a review of the combat power of the Armored Corps. It showed that with the development of national industrial construction and the hard work and study of all officers and soldiers, the combat power of the Armored Corps has been greatly enhanced. Among the representatives attending the meeting, Xie Degui, a tank driving technician from a shepherd background, skipped four grades in two years, leaping from a third-grade driver to second-grade, first-grade, and finally passing the exam to become a tank driving technician. In "one soldier, many uses," Zhang Dianqiang, a tank gun loader, has been promoted to a first-grade tank driver after a short period of hard work and study.
    The conference especially commended Ding Younian, the regimental commander of a certain mechanized regiment who had only three years of schooling but dared to write books. Based on China's geographical and climatic conditions, he compiled a textbook of more than 100,000 words on the tactical training of mechanized regiments. The conference also commended Shi Xinke, a tank disassembler who created a five-in-one small cart for refueling and watering, increasing work efficiency by three to fifty-nine times.
    At the meeting, representatives of thirteen major units made comprehensive reports on the Great Leap Forward in various tasks centered on combat training; representatives of twenty-eight advanced units and advanced individuals made reports on typical deeds.
    During the conference, dozens of units sent officer and soldier representatives to the meeting to report victories.
    Simultaneous with the report of victory and comparison meeting, the Armored Corps also held a Great Leap Forward exhibition and a literary and artistic performance. The exhibition displayed more than 2,000 inventions and creations, some of which reached the most advanced international levels. The literary and artistic performance featured a total of 130 literary and artistic programs created by soldiers.

    许光达大将号召全军保持高度警惕
    新华社28日讯　中国人民解放军装甲兵司令员许光达大将今天在装甲兵战斗训练和各项工作全面大跃进的报捷评比大会上说，美英帝国主义在中东的侵略，彻底暴露了它的帝国主义强盗的真面目。我们不希望战争，但是帝国主义要发动战争，我们也不怕。全军同志必须有充分的思想准备，保持高度的警惕。
    装甲兵报捷评比大会历时六天，今天闭幕。出席会议的有坦克和机械化师、团的领导干部以及先进单位的代表和先进人物等三百八十七人。
    这是一次检阅装甲兵战斗力量的大会。它表明了随着国家工业建设的发展和全体官兵的勤学苦练，装甲兵的战斗威力已有极大的增强。在参加会议的代表中，牧童出身的坦克驾驶技师谢德贵两年连跳四级，从三级驾驶员跃进到二级、一级，最后考上坦克驾驶技师。在“一兵多用”中，坦克炮的装填手张殿强，经过短期的苦练勤学已升为坦克一级驾驶员。
    大会特别表扬了只读过三年书、敢于著书立说的某机械化团团长丁有年，他根据我国地理气候条件，编写了一部十多万字的机械化团战术训练讲授提纲。大会还表扬了创造加油加水五用小车、提高工作效率三至五十九倍的坦克拆装工史新科。
    会上，有十三个大单位的代表，作了以战斗训练为中心的各项工作大跃进的综合报告；有二十八个先进单位和先进人物代表，作了典型事迹报告。
    大会期间，有几十个单位派官兵代表到会上报捷。
    与报捷评比大会进行的同时，装甲兵还举行了大跃进展览会和文艺会演。展览会展出了二千多件发明创造，其中有的达到了最先进的国际水平。文艺会演共演出了一百三十个由战士创作的文艺节目。
