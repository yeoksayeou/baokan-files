The state is using manpower and materials to help develop fish farming in remote areas such as the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest.

In order to solve the problem of people in remote areas with water but lacking fish, and no fish farming base, the state has recently allocated several million yuan to provinces such as Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Guizhou, Shanxi, Yunnan, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This money will be mainly used as fish farming funds and to establish fish breeding farms in these areas. At the same time, the state has also transferred sixty to seventy experienced and skilled fish farming technicians from provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong to the above-mentioned areas to conduct typical fish farming demonstrations and impart technology. In order to develop fish farming, remote provinces such as Gansu and Shaanxi have also sent agricultural cooperative members to provinces such as Hubei, which have a foundation in fish farming, to learn fish farming techniques.

    帮助边远地区养鱼
    国家以人力和物力帮助东北、西北、西南等边远地区发展养鱼事业。
    为了解决有水缺鱼、没有养鱼基础的边远地区的人民吃鱼问题，国家最近先后拿出几百万元给黑龙江、陕西、贵州、山西、云南等省和内蒙古自治区。这些钱将主要做为这些地区的养鱼基金和建立鱼种场等用。与此同时，国家还从江苏、浙江、广东等省调出六、七十名有经验、有技术的养鱼技工，到上述地区进行养鱼典型示范和传授技术。为了发展养鱼，甘肃、陕西等边远省份也派出农业社社员到养鱼有基础的湖北等省学习养鱼技术。
