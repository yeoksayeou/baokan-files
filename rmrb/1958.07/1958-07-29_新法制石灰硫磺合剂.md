    New Method for Preparing Lime Sulfur Mixture

    Lime sulfur mixture can prevent and control wheat stem rust, cotton red spider mites, and diseases and insect pests of fruit trees. In the past, the methods used in various places to prepare this pesticide were: two catties of sulfur powder, one catty of quicklime, and ten catties of water. The lime and sulfur were mixed separately into a paste with cold water. Then, in an iron pot, the clear water was brought to a boil. First, the lime slurry was poured into the pot and brought to a boil again, then the sulfur slurry was poured in, stirring constantly. Boiling water was added to replenish the water lost due to evaporation. Generally, it had to be boiled for more than an hour until it turned reddish-brown, resulting in lime sulfur mixture stock solution of 25-27 degrees. This method of preparation is not foolproof, and often due to improper preparation and firing, the finished product has a very low degree and cannot meet the standard.

    This year, the Jiangsu Commercial Department's experimental fields and the Gongdao Town Production Materials Store in Hanjiang County used one catty of sulfur powder, one catty of quicklime, and ten catties of water to prepare a 25-degree lime sulfur mixture. The differences in the preparation method compared to the above are: 1. Add enough cold water at once to boil, and no longer add boiling water in the middle; 2. Put the quicklime into the pot when the clear water is half-boiled; 3. Use the boiled lime water in the pot to mix the sulfur slurry; 4. From the time the water in the pot boils, keep the heat high to maintain the boiling point, and it will be ready in about forty minutes.

    According to calculations, the new method saves 50% of sulfur powder and reduces costs by 37% compared to the old method. Moreover, the finished product has a good color, a high degree, a short boiling time, and simple procedures.

### 新法制石灰硫磺合剂

    新法制石灰硫磺合剂
    石灰硫磺合剂，能防治麦类秆锈病、棉红蜘蛛和果树等病虫害。以往各地熬制这种药剂的方法：用硫磺粉二斤，生石灰一斤，水十斤，用冷水把石灰和硫磺分别调成糊状，另用铁锅把清水煮沸，先把石灰浆倒入锅内再煮沸，后倒入硫磺浆，不断搅拌。中间要加开水补足因蒸发所失去的水量，一般要熬一个多小时，煮到赤褐色时，即成25—27度的石硫合剂原液。这种熬制方法不保险，往往因为熬法和烧火不当，成品度数很低，不能达到标准。
    今年江苏商业厅试验田和邗江县公道镇生产资料商店改用一斤硫磺粉、一斤生石灰和十斤水熬成了25度的石硫合剂。熬制方法与上面的不同点是：1、一次加足冷水烧开，中间不再补加开水；2、锅内清水半开时用生石灰下锅；3、用锅内煮开的石灰水，调制硫磺浆；4、从锅内水开起，一直用急火保持沸点，煮四十分钟左右即成。
    根据计算结果，新法比老法节约硫磺粉50％，降低成本37％。并且成品色泽好、度数高，熬煮时间短，工序简便。
