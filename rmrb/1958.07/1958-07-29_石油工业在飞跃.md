	Petroleum Industry Soars
	By our reporter Yao Bingjian
	
	The Ministry of Petroleum Industry, at a recent on-site meeting in the Yumen Oil Mine, set a magnificent goal: to make China's crude oil production rank among the world's advanced levels in the shortest possible time.
	
	Before liberation, China's petroleum industry was practically a "blank sheet of paper." In 1949, when the country was liberated, there were only twenty or so geological personnel and a few dilapidated drilling rigs. From 1907 to 1948, the total drilling footage over forty years was only a little more than 30,000 meters. Crude oil production was even more meager. With the red flag of liberation planted all over the country, we have built a large petroleum army equipped with modern technology, mastering many advanced petroleum exploration technologies such as geophysical prospecting, atomic energy radioactive logging, and bacterial exploration. Drilling speed has also been unprecedentedly improved, and the average monthly drilling speed of a few drilling teams has even exceeded the level of the United States in 1957. Before liberation, a drilling team could drill only about 1,000 meters a year, but now many drilling teams can drill 1,000 to more than 2,000 meters a month. In 1956, the Yumen Oil Mine 3203 drilling team created a national record of drilling more than 10,000 meters in a year, but this year, the Yumen Oil Mine 1202 drilling team has drilled more than 9,000 meters in half a year. Currently, this team is advancing towards the goal of drilling 20,000 meters per year.
	
	Thanks to the efforts of the petroleum heroes, China's petroleum industry has undergone rapid changes. According to the statistics of the First Five-Year Plan, geological exploration has been carried out in more than 290,000 square kilometers of the country, and drilling operations have been carried out on fifty-one structures, with a total of more than 840,000 meters drilled, which is equivalent to twenty-eight times the total drilling footage in the forty years before liberation. Many new oil fields have been found. In the past eight years, oil production has also increased by leaps and bounds. In 1957, the national crude oil production increased more than tenfold compared with 1949. The United States, the most developed country in the petroleum industry, took thirty-three years to increase its annual oil production by more than two times. These ironclad facts prove the unparalleled superiority of China's socialist system and that China's petroleum industry's technical strength is growing stronger.
	
	The absurd theory of "China being oil-poor" has been thoroughly bankrupt. According to existing data, China is a country rich in natural petroleum resources. In the vast land of the country, the sedimentary rock area suitable for oil storage is about 2.6 million square kilometers. The thickness of sedimentary rocks in the Sichuan Basin reaches more than 10,000 meters, and the shallowest is also several thousand meters. We have developed the Yumen Laojunmiao Oilfield and built China's first natural petroleum base. Then, we found the Petroleum Gully, Baiyang River, Malianquan Oilfield, and Ya'erxia Oilfield around it. We have also found the three major oil areas of Qaidam, Central Sichuan, and Karamay. Now these oil areas are under intense construction and development. Oil has also been discovered in the Songliao Plain, Ordos, Subei Plain, North China Plain, and Guizhou. Recently, the reporter had the opportunity to visit the responsible comrades of the petroleum industry departments in Xinjiang, Sichuan, North China, and other places, and they told many exciting news. Xinjiang not only has oil, but it is simply an oil sea. Oil seeps found in southern Xinjiang are everywhere, and the Turpan Basin and Junggar Basin contain even richer oil. Many areas of the country have also found abundant oil shale mines; as for the rich coal reserves that can be refined into oil, they are spread all over the country.
	
	All these concentrate on illustrating one issue. Under the illumination of the Party's General Line, and implementing the policy of developing large, medium, and small-sized projects simultaneously, we have sufficient conditions to develop the petroleum industry at high speed and reach the peak of world oil production!

    石油工业在飞跃
    本报记者　姚秉鉴
    石油工业部最近在玉门油矿召开的现场会议上提出了一个宏伟的奋斗目标，即在最短时间内，使我国的原油产量跃居世界先进行列。
    解放以前，我国的石油工业几乎等于是“一张白纸”。1949年全国解放时只有二十多名地质人员和几部破旧的钻机。1907年到1948年四十多年来的钻井总进尺才是三万多公尺。原油生产更是少得可怜。随着解放的红旗插遍全国之后，我们已经建设起一支庞大的拥有现代化技术装备的石油大军，掌握了地球物理探矿、原子能放射性测井、细菌勘探等许多种先进的石油勘探技术。钻井速度也空前提高，有少数钻井队的平均钻机月速度并且已经超过美国1957年的水平，解放前，一个钻井队一年也不过钻一千公尺左右，现在许多钻井队一月就能钻一千到两千多公尺。1956年玉门油矿3203钻井队曾创造了全年钻一万多公尺的全国最高纪录，但今年玉门油矿1202钻井队在半年的时间内就钻进了九千多公尺，目前，这个队正向年钻两万公尺的目标前进。
    由于石油英雄们的努力，我国的石油工业才起了日新月异的变化。根据第一个五年计划的统计，全国已在二十九万多平方公里的地区进行了地质勘查，并在五十一个构造上展开了钻探工作，共钻井八十四万多公尺，等于解放前四十多年内钻井进尺总和的二十八倍。找到许多新的油田。八年来，石油产量也是跃进式地增长。1957年全国原油产量比1949年增长了十多倍。而美国，这个石油工业最发达的国家，为了使石油的年产量提高两倍多，却用了三十三年的时间。这些铁一般的事实证明了我国社会主义制度的无比优越性，证明了我国的石油工业技术力量正在日益成长壮大。
      “中国贫油论”的荒谬理论，已经彻底破产了。根据现有资料表明，我国是一个天然石油资源丰富的国家。在全国广阔的土地上适宜于储藏石油的沉积岩面积约有二百六十多万平方公里。四川盆地的沉积岩厚度达一万多公尺，浅者也在几千公尺。我们开发了玉门老君庙油田，并且建成了我国第一个天然石油基地，接着，又在它的周围找到了石油沟、白杨河、马莲泉油田和鸭儿峡大油田。我们还找到了柴达木、川中、克拉玛依三大油区，现在这些油区正在紧张地进行建设和开发。在松辽平原、鄂尔多斯、苏北平原、华北平原和贵州等地区都发现了石油。最近记者有机会又访问了新疆、四川、华北等地石油工业部门的负责同志，他们又告诉了许多令人兴奋的消息。新疆不但有油，简直是一片油海。在南疆发现的油苗遍地皆是，在吐鲁番盆地、准噶尔盆地更藏有丰富的石油。全国许多地区还找到了储量丰富的油页岩矿；至于能够炼油的丰富煤藏更是遍布全国。
    所有这些，都集中地说明了一个问题。我们在党的总路线照耀下，贯彻大中小并举的方针，有足够的条件高速度地发展石油工业，登上世界石油产量的最高峰！
