Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 29th. The mobile medical team organized by Zhongshan Medical College of Guangzhou City has gone deep into the countryside and small cities to serve the masses, and is welcomed by the masses.

This mobile medical team, consisting of ten people including associate professors, lecturers, and doctors, has been diagnosing illnesses and publicizing health knowledge to the masses in Gujing, Meige, Muzhou, Xinsha, Hengfen and other townships in Xinhui County, and Jiangmen City for more than two months. Every time the medical staff arrived in a township, patients from far and near came to them for treatment. Because the doctors' diagnosis was accurate, the medicine used was simple, and they considered the patients, the patients spent less money and recovered quickly. Some medical staff also went to farmers' homes to treat farmers, care for patients, carry out health propaganda and conduct investigations. The masses called them good doctors sent by Chairman Mao.

The mobile medical team held a short-term training class for midwifery personnel in Xinhui, training dozens of midwives, and cultivated an ophthalmologist for Xinhui County, helping Liangmin Hospital in this county to establish an ophthalmology department and an operating room; they also worked with local doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine to study ways to prevent and treat encephalitis, and formulated a plan for Western medicine to treat encephalitis.

This mobile medical team also plans to continue working in Panyu County.
