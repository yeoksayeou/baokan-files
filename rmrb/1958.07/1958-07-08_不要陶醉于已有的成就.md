Some leading organs in Shanghai are inspecting the rectification situation. During the inspection, it was found that the leading comrades of some units have relaxed their efforts in rectification. There was a Party branch secretary of a factory who, when asked by comrades inspecting the rectification what the main content of the big-character posters put up by cadres was, replied, "I haven't analyzed them carefully!" When asked what the branch's plans for rectification were, he replied, "There are no plans yet." It turned out that this branch secretary had locked all these big-character posters in a drawer. Some leading cadres of other factories no longer practiced working alongside the workers, but sat in the office all day as they used to. When the leading organs criticized this practice, some comrades even used "achievements are fundamental, shortcomings are secondary" as a shield. In the report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Party Central Committee to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, he reminded us: "The rectification movement that started in May of last year has now achieved great success. But if we are intoxicated with existing achievements, thinking that everything is fine, then that is completely wrong." It seems that some comrades have not paid attention to this instruction, and before the rectification movement has ended, they have become intoxicated, thinking that everything is fine.

Needless to say, for a region or a system, even for these units that have relaxed their rectification efforts, the achievements of rectification are indeed the main thing, and the ratio of shortcomings to achievements is only one finger to nine fingers. If anyone sees us criticizing these places for relaxing their efforts and becoming arrogant, and then doubts the achievements of the rectification, or only sees the great achievements and ignores the shortcomings and existing problems, then he does not understand our Party's serious attitude towards that considerable one-finger of shortcomings and errors.

With great achievements in rectification and a great leap forward in various tasks, can it be said that the rectification movement is all done and dusted? The question is very clear. Since the rectification stage has not yet ended, the problems that need to be solved and can be solved have not been completely resolved, and the fourth stage of the rectification movement has not ended, how can everything be fine? With the thought that everything is fine, it is impossible to do as the Party Central Committee requires: to carry out the rectification to the end and strive for a complete victory in the rectification movement.

Even if the rectification movement is over, is everything fine? No, it is not. As long as you understand materialist dialectics, as long as you are a believer in continuous revolution, you will not hope for a day when everything is fine. Things are constantly developing and changing, and new problems and new difficulties will inevitably arise and need to be solved. This is true for work, and it is also true for people's thinking and work style. Especially in this era of the Great Leap Forward, if we want to make our own thinking, work style, and methods keep up with the needs of objective situation, this is not a simple matter. It requires us to invigorate our spirits and, without relaxing for a moment, discover new problems and solve new problems.

Any cadre who is intoxicated with existing achievements and lets the idea of hoping for everything to be fine quietly creep into his mind, his mental state will retreat from striving to move upward to settling for the middle or even being content with the lower reaches, and he will fall out of the ranks of the promoters and join the ranks of the regressives!

    不要陶醉于已有的成就
    易槐
    上海市的一些领导机关正在对整改的情况进行检查。在检查中发现，有些单位的领导同志对整改工作已经放松了。就有这么一位工厂的党支部书记，当检查整风的同志问他给干部贴的大字报的主要内容是什么。他回答说：“没有仔细分析！”再问支部对整改的打算如何，答曰“还没有打算。”原来这位支部书记已经把这些大字报都锁到抽屉里去了。另有些工厂的领导干部不再实行跟班劳动，像过去一样整天坐在办公室里。当领导机关对这种作法提出批评时，有些同志竟以“成绩是基本的，缺点是次要的”作为挡箭牌。刘少奇同志代表党中央向八大二次会议所作的报告中已经提醒我们：“从去年5月开始的整风运动，现在已经取得了巨大的成就。但是我们如果陶醉于已有的成就，以为已经万事大吉，那就是完全错误的了。”看来有些同志偏偏没有注意这个指示，在整风运动还没有结束的时候，就陶醉起来，以为已经万事大吉了。
    不必说一个地区或一个系统，就是这些对整改松了劲的单位，一般说整改的成绩也的确是主要的，缺点和成绩的比例，不过是一个指头对九个指头。如果谁看到我们批评这些地方松了劲，又滋长了骄气，就怀疑起整风的成就，或者是只看到成绩很大而忽视了缺点和存在的问题；那他就不懂得我们党对待那相当一个指头的缺点和错误的严肃态度。
    整改有了很大成绩，各种工作都在大跃进，这能不能说是整风运动已经万事大吉了呢？问题很清楚，整改阶段既然还没有结束，需要解决而又可能解决的问题还没有完全解决，整风运动第四阶段还没有结束，这怎能万事大吉呢？有了已经万事大吉的思想，就不可能像党中央所要求的：把整风进行到底，争取整风运动的全胜。
    就是整风运动结束了，是不是万事大吉了呢？也不是。只要懂得唯物辩证法，只要是一个不断革命论者，就不会希望有万事大吉的那一天。事物就是在不断地发展变化着的，新的问题新的困难也就必然不断地发生，需要解决。工作如此，人的思想作风也如此。特别在这大跃进的时代，要想使自己的思想自己的工作作风和方法能赶上客观形势发展的需要，这并不是一件简单的事，需要我们振奋精神，一刻也不放松地去发现新问题和解决新问题。
    任何一个干部陶醉于已有的成就，让希望万事大吉的念头悄悄地钻到自己的脑子里，他的精神状态就会从力争上游退到安居中游甚至甘居下游，就会从促进派的队伍中掉队而走到促退派的行列中去！
