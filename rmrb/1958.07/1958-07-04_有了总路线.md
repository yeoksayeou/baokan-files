Singing the General Line

    With the General Line, our eyes look thousands of miles afar,
    From spring we gaze to autumn, seeing ten years in a glance.
    With the General Line, our legs are swift as arrows,
    This step crosses the Yellow River, the next south of the Yangtze.
    With the General Line, our hands are quick as lightning,
    What used to take ten years of work, is now completed in half a day.
    With the General Line, our minds surpass immortals,
    Ten thousand ways exist, all difficulties roll away.
    With the General Line, our enthusiasm bursts through the sky,
    Strong enough to lift a thousand-pound stone, to push over a ten-thousand-zhang mountain.
    With the General Line, our hearts are wider than the sky,
    Red flag smiles in our hearts, joyous songs never cease.

    有了总路线
    张志民
    有了总路线，眼望千里远，
    从春瞧到秋，一眼看十年。
    有了总路线，两腿赛如箭。
    这步过黄河，下步长江南。
    有了总路线，手快如闪电，
    往日十年工，今日半天完。
    有了总路线，头脑胜神仙。
    办法千万条，困难都滚蛋。
    有了总路线，干劲冲破天，
    力拔千斤石，手推万丈山。
    有了总路线，心比天还宽，
    红旗心中笑，喜歌唱不完。
