Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: Beijing Islamic figures who have visited Middle Eastern countries have successively issued statements, angrily denouncing the armed aggression of US-British imperialism in the Middle East, and expressing their firm stance with the Arab people.

An Shiwei, the Ahong of the Niujie Mosque in Beijing, who visited Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan with the Chinese Islamic Hajj Delegation in 1956, used his personal experiences to illustrate the friendly feelings of the people of Middle Eastern countries towards the Chinese people. During a visit to Tripoli, crowds of people surrounded the car they were riding in, shouting slogans such as "Long live People's China." An Shiwei said: We firmly stand with the people of the Middle East and oppose US-British imperialist aggression in the Middle East.

Chen Guangyuan, the Ahong of the Changping District Mosque, who participated in the Chinese student delegation's visit to Syria last year, saw armed men, women, and children marching and demonstrating in the streets of Damascus. The students attended classes in the morning and conducted military exercises in the afternoon. Both sides of the street were plastered with inspiring slogans and cartoons such as "Dig the trenches deep and bury the invaders!" and "Brothers, the era of enslavement is over!" Chen Guangyuan said: "When people saw the Chinese student delegation, they often rushed to cheer: 'The Chinese people are our brothers.' Many people exchanged gifts with us, and some held our hands and said: 'Thank you to the 600 million people of China for standing with us.'" Chen Guangyuan said: These scenes moved me deeply, and we must fully support the struggle of the Arab people.

Yang Pinsan, the Ahong of the Tongzhou District Mosque, who participated in the Chinese youth delegation's visit to Egypt this March, saw that the Arab people hated imperialism like they hated the plague. He said, "The play 'Beating the British Soldiers' performed for the Chinese youth delegation by Egyptian elementary school students vividly demonstrated the Arab people's contempt and hatred for the imperialists." Yang Pinsan also described to reporters the moving scenes of the Egyptian people welcoming the Chinese youth delegation. He said: I will never forget the lofty friendship that the Arab people showed to the Chinese people. Now that US-British imperialism has openly launched armed aggression against them, we must fully support the struggle of the Arab people.

Li Deshou, Director of the Democratic Management Committee of the Niujie Mosque, who visited Lebanon and Jordan in 1956, said: The friendship of the people of Lebanon and Jordan towards the Chinese people often makes me think of them. After the Chinese Islamic Hajj Delegation entered Jordanian territory, it was often welcomed by the Jordanian people along the way. In the shopping malls, shop assistants would stop doing business when they saw us and clap and greet us enthusiastically. We also received the warmest reception from the Lebanese people in Beirut. Li Deshou said: This unity and friendship between the Arab and Chinese people cannot be undermined by anyone. Now that US-British imperialism dares to send troops to invade the Middle East, we must resolutely fight the invaders to the end together with the Arab people.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 25th: People from all walks of life in Tianjin who have visited the Middle East held a gathering on the 24th to protest against the US-British imperialist aggression in the Middle East, pointing out that the Arab people's struggle against colonialism will surely win victory.

Everyone recalled the brotherly friendship of the Arab people towards the Chinese people. Wang Jinfeng, the vice-captain of the Tianjin football team who visited the United Arab Republic in the spring of 1958, said: "The people of the Middle East are very enthusiastic towards the Chinese people. In the United Arab Republic, once we passed through a rural village late at night, many local farmers invited us to be guests and inquired in detail about China's construction. The Lebanese people also sent representatives to invite us to Lebanon. At that time, due to the obstruction of the Shamun government, we could not go, but the sincerity of the Lebanese people moved us very much." Han Zhiren Halunai Gan, a Muslim who visited Egypt and other places in 1956, said: "During our visit to the Middle East, the Arab people warmly welcomed us and shouted slogans such as 'Long live China' and 'Long live peace,' expressing their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people for supporting the Middle Eastern people's anti-colonial struggle." The speakers unanimously pointed out: The common aspirations of opposing colonialism and loving peace connect the hearts of the Arab and Chinese people, who are thousands of miles apart. The victory of the Arab people is our victory, and the Chinese people will never allow imperialism to bully our brothers.

Ji Peifang, the leader of the Tianjin football team, said: "During our visit to the United Arab Republic, we could see many relics of the Arab people's anti-colonial struggle in the streets and museums, and hear stories of the Arab people bravely and wisely resisting the invaders. This made us deeply realize that the Arab people, who have long been oppressed by imperialism, have a strong will to oppose imperialist aggression. Now, the US and Britain want to occupy the Middle East by force again. In the face of the awakened Arab people, the invaders will surely be defeated!" Liu Shiheng, the Ahong of the Xiaohuo Lane Mosque, who went to Mecca on pilgrimage the year before last, said: "The Lebanese people's desire for national independence is very strong. Last September, two Lebanese friends came to Tianjin to visit and told me about the suffering lives of the Lebanese people, expressing the Lebanese people's determination to fight for independence. Now, just as the Lebanese people are holding high the banner of justice, imperialism is carrying out armed intervention. I firmly demand that the American troops get out of Lebanon!"

Li Jinsheng, a worker at the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Shao Xiankai, the coach of the Tianjin football team, and players Li Yuankui and Li Hengyi, who have also visited the Middle East, also unanimously angrily condemned the US-British imperialist aggression in the Middle East. They paid tribute to the Arab people who bravely resisted US-British aggression, and pointed out that the peace-loving people of the world stand with the Arab people, and the wolfish ambitions of US-British imperialism will surely be completely shattered.

    阿拉伯人民的斗争一定胜利
    北京天津访问过中东的人士集会抗议美英侵略
    新华社26日讯　曾经访问过中东国家的北京伊斯兰教界人士，纷纷发表谈话，愤怒斥责美英帝国主义在中东地区的武装侵略，他们表示坚决和阿拉伯人民站在一起。
    1956年随中国伊斯兰教朝觐团访问叙利亚、黎巴嫩和约旦的北京市牛街清真寺阿訇安士伟，用他亲身感受的事实，说明中东各国人民对中国人民的友好感情。在访问的黎波里时，成群的人围住了他们乘坐的汽车，高呼“人民中国万岁”等口号。安士伟说：我们坚决站在中东人民一边，反对美英帝国主义侵略中东。
    昌平区清真寺阿訇陈广元去年参加中国学生代表团到叙利亚访问时，看到武装起来的男女老少在大马士革街道上游行示威，学生们上午上课，下午进行军事演习。街道两旁贴满“把战壕挖得深深的，埋葬侵略者！”“兄弟们，被奴役的时代已经过去了！”等激动人心的标语漫画。陈广元说：“当人们看到中国学生代表团的时候，常常涌来欢呼：‘中国人民是我们的兄弟’，许多人和我们交换礼物，有的人拉着我们的手说：‘感谢中国的六亿人民和我们站在一起。’”陈广元说：这些景象使我十分感动，我们要全力支援阿拉伯人民的斗争。
    通州区清真寺阿訇杨品三在今年3月曾参加中国青年代表团访问过埃及，看到阿拉伯人民像憎恨瘟疫一样地憎恨帝国主义。他说：“埃及的小学生给中国青年代表团演出的‘打英国兵’话剧，就形象地表现了阿拉伯人民对帝国主义者的藐视和仇恨。”杨品三还向记者描述了埃及人民欢迎中国青年代表团的动人情景，他说：我忘不了阿拉伯人民对中国人民所表示的崇高友谊，现在美英帝国主义公然向他们发动武装侵略，我们要全力支持阿拉伯人民的斗争。
    1956年访问过黎巴嫩和约旦的牛街清真寺民主管理委员会主任李德寿说：黎巴嫩和约旦人民对中国人民的友谊，时常使我怀念。中国伊斯兰教朝觐团进入约旦国境以后，经常受到约旦人民的夹道欢迎。在商场内，店员看到我们便停止做生意，热情地鼓掌和问候。我们在贝鲁特也同样受到黎巴嫩人民最热情的接待。李德寿说：阿拉伯人民和中国人民的这种团结和友谊是任何人破坏不了的，现在美英帝国主义竟敢出兵侵略中东人民，我们要和阿拉伯人民一同向侵略者坚决斗争到底。
    新华社天津25日电　天津市曾经访问过中东的各界人士24日举行集会，抗议美英帝国主义侵略中东，指出阿拉伯人民的反对殖民主义斗争必将赢得胜利。
    大家回忆了阿拉伯人民对中国人民的兄弟般的情谊。1958年春天去阿拉伯联合共和国访问的天津市足球代表队副队长王金丰说：“中东人民对中国人民非常热情，在阿拉伯联合共和国，有一次我们深夜路过农村，当地很多农民邀请我们去作客，并详细询问中国的建设情况。黎巴嫩人民也派代表邀请我们去黎巴嫩，当时由于夏蒙政府的阻挠，没有去成，但是黎巴嫩人民的热诚，使我们非常感动。”1956年访问过埃及等地的穆斯林罕志·哈鲁乃·干一说：“在中东访问时，阿拉伯人民热情欢迎我们，还高呼‘中国万岁’、‘和平万岁’的口号，表示对中国人民支持中东人民反殖民主义斗争的衷心感谢。”发言的人一致指出：反对殖民主义、热爱和平的共同愿望，把相隔几千里的阿拉伯人民和中国人民的心联系在一起，阿拉伯人民的胜利就是我们的胜利，中国人民决不容许帝国主义欺侮我们的兄弟。
    天津市足球代表队领队纪裴芳说：“在我们访问阿拉伯联合共和国时，无论在街道、在博物馆，都可以看到许多关于阿拉伯人民反殖民主义斗争的遗迹，听到阿拉伯人民勇敢而智慧地反抗侵略者的故事。这使我们深深体会到，长期受帝国主义压迫的阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义侵略的意志是坚强的。现在，美英又想凭武力侵占中东，在觉悟了的阿拉伯人民面前，侵略者一定遭到失败！”前年曾去麦加朝觐的小伙巷清真寺的阿訇刘世衡说：“黎巴嫩人民要求民族独立的心情非常强烈，去年9月，黎巴嫩的两位朋友来天津参观时，对我倾诉了黎巴嫩人民的苦难生活，表示了黎巴嫩人民一定要争取独立的愿望。现在，正当黎巴嫩人民高举正义大旗的时候，帝国主义竟进行武装干涉，我坚决要求美国军队滚出黎巴嫩！”
    曾经访问过中东的国营天津第一棉纺织厂工人李金生、天津市足球代表队指导邵先凯、队员李元魁、李恒益等，也一致愤怒地谴责美英帝国主义侵略中东的罪行。他们向英勇反抗美英侵略的阿拉伯人民致敬，并且指出全世界爱好和平的人民和阿拉伯人民站在一起，美英帝国主义的狼子野心一定能被彻底粉碎。
