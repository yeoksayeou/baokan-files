    Isolated Aggressors
    A dispatch from the Middle East by a reporter for the "Times," an old-line British bourgeois newspaper, proves that the British aggressors, facing the increasingly strong resistance and anger of the Jordanian people, have fallen into a state of extreme nervousness and unease. The reporter admits that even among those dwindling numbers who still support Hussein, it "does not mean they welcome the presence of British troops in Jordan."
    This report illustrates an irrefutable fact: aggressors are always unpopular. They are bound to be isolated in the just public opinion of the world, and they cannot but encounter increasingly strong resistance in the occupied land. Although the British aggressors appear powerful, the people of the small country of Jordan have shown extraordinary heroism: they will never bow to the aggressors!
    There is only one path before the British aggressors: withdraw troops from Jordan, just as British Labour MP Crossman said, "The British paratroopers should be withdrawn (from Jordan) – and bring Hussein back with them."

    孤立的侵略者
    英国老牌资产阶级报纸“泰晤士报”记者从中东发出的通讯证明，英国侵略军面对着约旦人民越来越强烈的反抗怒火，已陷入风声鹤唳、惊慌不安的处境中；这位记者承认，甚至在那些越来越少的支持侯赛因的人们中间，也“并不意味着他们欢迎英国军队驻扎在约旦”。
    这篇报道说明了一个颠扑不破的事实：侵略者总是不得人心的，它在全世界公正舆论中必然陷于孤立，在被侵占的国土上也不能不碰到日益强烈的反抗。英国侵略者虽然貌似强大，小小的约旦国家的人民却已显示了非凡的英雄气概：决不向侵略者低头！
    英国侵略者面前只有一条路，从约旦撤军，正像英国工党议员克罗斯曼说的，应当把“英国伞兵（从约旦）撤回国来——而且带着侯赛因回来”。
