The International Commission for Laos Must Be Retained
Commentator of this newspaper

The chairmen of the Geneva Conference, Britain and the Soviet Union, are consulting on the question of whether the International Commission for Laos should continue to carry out its mission, at the request of the International Commission for Laos. This has aroused serious concern among all countries and people concerned about peace in Indochina. Because, in the nearly four years since the ceasefire, the International Commission for Laos has made positive contributions to the implementation of the Geneva Accords; in the future, the continued existence of the International Commission for Laos will be a positive factor in ensuring the security and sovereignty of Laos and peace in Indochina.

China, as a participant in the Geneva Conference and as a friendly neighbor of the Indochinese countries, cannot agree with the proposition of unilaterally terminating the activities of the International Commission for Laos. We have made it clear long ago that such a proposition violates both the interests of peace in Indochina and the letter and spirit of the Geneva Accords.

The only "reason" given by those who advocate stopping the activities of the International Commission for Laos is that the supplementary elections held in Laos on May 4 have resolved "all the issues" stipulated in the Geneva Accords. "All the tasks" entrusted to the commission have been completed. However, from an internal perspective, the actual situation in Laos shows that the supplementary elections have not resolved all the issues stipulated in the Geneva Accords. The situation in Laos is not completely normal. Until now, acts of retaliation and discrimination in violation of Article 15 of the Lao Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities continue to occur. The political settlement stipulated in Article 14 of the agreement has not been fully realized. From an external perspective, peace in Laos has not been consolidated. U.S. imperialism is exerting various pressures and methods to intensify its interference in Laos, plotting to undermine the peaceful neutrality of Laos. All these circumstances show that the task of the International Commission stipulated in the Geneva Accords has not been completed; both internal and external considerations require the International Commission for Laos to continue to exist and work diligently.

In addition, peace in Indochina is indivisible. The existence or non-existence of the International Commission for Laos cannot be handled solely based on the situation in Laos, but should be linked to the development of the entire Indochinese situation. To this end, Article 39 of the Geneva Agreement on the Question of Laos, Article 46 of the Agreement on the Question of Vietnam, and Article 25 of the Agreement on the Question of Cambodia stipulate that the three International Commissions should continue their activities until the political issues of the three countries have been fully resolved. As everyone knows, due to the conspiracies and sabotage of U.S. imperialism, the political settlement in Vietnam has not been realized, and the situation remains very complex. The peaceful neutrality of Cambodia is also constantly threatened by provocations and pressures from the United States. At such a time, the proposition of unilaterally terminating the activities of the International Commission for Laos not only violates the provisions and spirit of the Geneva Accords, but also will make the situation in Indochina and Southeast Asia more complicated and acute.

Therefore, whether based on the Geneva Accords themselves or the current actual situation in Indochina, we believe that the International Commission for Laos must continue to work. Naturally, appropriate adjustments to its activities and institutions themselves can be made as long as they do not affect the execution of its mission. But stopping the commission's activities is not permissible, because this will inevitably hinder the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords in the entire Indochina and will help the destructive activities of U.S. imperialism.

We hope that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and all relevant countries can reach a correct conclusion on the issue of the International Commission for Laos continuing to carry out its mission in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords and the interests of peace in Indochina.

    老挝国际委员会必须保留
    本报评论员
    关于老挝国际委员会应否继续执行任务的问题，日内瓦会议的两位主席、英国和苏联，已应老挝国际委员会的要求，正在进行商谈。这已引起了所有关心印度支那和平的国家和人民的严重关切。因为，老挝国际委员会在停战后将近四年的时间里，曾经为日内瓦协议的实施，作出了积极的贡献；今后，老挝国际委员会的继续存在，对于保证老挝的安全和主权，以及印度支那和平都将是一个积极的因素。
    中国，作为日内瓦会议的参加者，作为印度支那国家的友好邻邦，不能赞同那种单独停止老挝国际委员会活动的主张。我们早已明白表示过：以上这种主张是既违背印度支那和平的利益，也违反日内瓦协议的文字和精神的。
    主张停止老挝国际委员会活动的人们，所持的唯一“理由”是：老挝5月4日举行的补充选举已经解决了日内瓦协议中规定的“一切问题”。协定委托给委员会的“一切任务”已经执行完毕。然而，从内部看，老挝的实际情况说明，补充选举并没有解决日内瓦协议中规定的所有问题。老挝的局势还不是完全正常。直到目前为止，违反老挝停止敌对行动协定第十五条的报复和歧视行为还在继续发生。协定第十四条规定的政治解决还没有完全实现。从外部看，老挝的和平还没有得到巩固。美帝国主义正在施用各种压力和手段，加紧对老挝的干涉，阴谋破坏老挝的和平中立。所有这些情况表明，日内瓦协议所规定的国际委员会的任务还没有完成；内部和外部的考虑都要求老挝国际委员会继续存在和认真地工作下去。
    此外，印度支那和平是不可分割的，老挝国际委员会的存在与否，不能单纯根据老挝的情况处理，而应联系到整个印度支那局势的发展。为此，日内瓦会议关于老挝问题协定的第三十九条、关于越南问题协定的第四十六条和关于柬埔寨问题协定的二十五条规定，在三个国家的政治问题还没有得到完全解决以前，三个国际委员会应当继续进行活动。大家知道，由于美帝国主义的阴谋破坏，越南的政治解决一直不能实现，局势至今仍然是很复杂的。柬埔寨的和平中立，也不时受到来自美国方面的挑衅和压力的威胁。在这样的时候，单独停止老挝国际委员会活动的主张，不但违反了日内瓦协议的条文和精神，而且将使印度支那和东南亚局势更趋复杂化和尖锐化。
    因此，不论根据日内瓦协议本身或是印度支那当前的实际情况考虑，我们都认为，老挝国际委员会必须继续工作。自然，只要不影响任务的执行，对它的活动和机构本身作适当的调整是可以的。但停止委员会的活动是不能允许的，因为这必然会妨碍日内瓦协议在整个印度支那的彻底实施，有助于美帝国主义的破坏活动。
    我们希望日内瓦会议的两位主席和一切有关国家，能够根据日内瓦协议的精神和印度支那和平的利益，对老挝国际委员会继续执行任务的问题作出正确的结论。
