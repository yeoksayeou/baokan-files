    New Reclamation Area for Sugar Beet Production on the Altai Steppe
    The mystery of the ancient Altai Mountain wilderness has been unveiled. Recently, a survey team from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps surveyed a new reclamation area with 13 million mu of arable land and found abundant water sources to irrigate these lands. Survey data proves that the soil conditions here are very good. Although the winters are relatively harsh, the summer temperatures are suitable for the growth of crops such as sugar beets and wheat. The foothills are rich in water and grass, which can be used to develop animal husbandry. In the Second Five-Year Plan, the Production Corps will reclaim three million mu of land here, cultivate a large amount of sugar beets, and develop animal husbandry, transforming the ancient Altai Steppe into a large reclamation area mainly producing sugar beets.

    阿尔泰草原生产甜菜的新垦区
    古老的阿尔泰山荒原之谜已被揭破。最近新疆生产建设兵团一支勘测队在那里勘查出一个拥有一千三百万亩可耕土地的新垦区，并且找到了灌溉这些土地的丰富水源。勘测资料证明，这里的土壤条件很好。冬季虽较严寒，夏季气温却适宜甜菜、小麦等作物的生长。靠近山麓地带水草丰美，可供发展畜牧业。在第二个五年计划中，生产兵团将在这里开垦出三百万亩土地，大量种植甜菜和发展畜牧业，把古老的阿尔泰草原开垦成为以生产甜菜为主的大垦区。  （新华社）
