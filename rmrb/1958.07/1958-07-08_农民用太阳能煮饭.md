Farmers in Chongde County, Zhejiang Province, have successfully experimented with using solar energy for cooking. After the Party Central Committee issued the call to realize technological revolution, farmers of the Sixth Cooperative of Wancun Township, Chongde County, based on the principle that convex lenses and the silver bowl of a flashlight can focus light, first used wooden buckets and mud to make models for experimentation. When the models were placed in the sun, they could find a focus that felt scalding, so they boldly carried out experiments in boiling water and cooking rice.

    农民用太阳能煮饭
    浙江省崇德县农民利用太阳能烧饭试验成功。当党中央发出实现技术革命的号召后，崇德县晚村乡六社农民根据凸透镜、手电筒的银碗能使光形成一个焦点的原理，首先用木桶和泥做成模型进行试验；当模型放到太阳底下，就能找到像烫手的焦点，这样他们就大胆进行了烧水，煮饭的试验。
