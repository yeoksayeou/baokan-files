Grain Harvested and Stored is a True Bumper Harvest
Jiangxi Seizes Pre-Harvest Management of Early Rice

(This newspaper reports) Jiangxi Province has 24 million mu of early rice, with first-class and second-class seedlings accounting for over 90%. Many farmers say that this year's early rice is so tall it goes over people’s heads, and so dense that even frogs can't find their way out. Some even use the phrase "you could throw an egg on it, and it wouldn't shake or fall" to describe the robustness of the early rice. Faced with a scene of bumper harvest, the vast majority of cadres and the masses are clear-headed. They are determined that "it doesn't count as a bumper harvest until the grain is in the granary". They are actively engaged in disaster relief if there is a disaster and disaster prevention if there isn't, to ensure an even greater harvest.

After successfully combating the floods in May in the Nanchang and Jiujiang Special Districts, many places experienced drought in June. Therefore, the people in these areas mobilized urgently to engage in the fight against drought. In Pengze, Ruichang, and Hukou counties of the Jiujiang Special District, more than 70,000 people and more than 20,000 waterwheels were working day and night to combat the drought, and most of the drought-affected seedlings have been rescued. While fighting the drought, some unaffected areas have also mobilized to prepare for drought prevention. In some areas of the Ji'an Special District and the Gan Nan Administrative Region, more than 300,000 mu of early rice has been affected by insect pests. These areas seized the opportunity and mobilized urgently, and basically eliminated the insect pests within a few days. In Suichuan County, more than 10,000 mu of early rice was infested with insect pests. The whole county immediately dispatched more than 20,000 people to inspect and eliminate the pests, paddy by paddy, wiping out the pests in three days. In order to prevent possible diseases and insect pests, more than 20 counties including Xingguo, Xinfeng, and Nanchang have established pest control command organizations at all levels, and have prepared sufficient medicines and equipment, proposing to eliminate the pests wherever they are found. In the Shangrao Special District, Leping, Guixi, Boyang and other counties have recently conducted serious investigations and estimates of this year's early rice yield, and believe that this year's early rice is an unprecedented bumper harvest. However, they are not satisfied with this. These counties have already mobilized and decided to launch a blitz in the 20-plus days before the harvest: to eliminate third-class seedlings, strengthen field management, and do a good job in the four preventions of insect control, drought prevention, flood prevention, and lodging prevention, in order to strive for a greater harvest. Some counties, in view of the fact that rice in previous years had suffered from wind, rain, and hail after being harvested and placed on the threshing ground, have now started to build temporary field rain shelters and temporary rainproof warehouses.

    粮食收到囤里才算丰收
    江西抓紧早稻收割前的管理工作
    本报讯　江西省二千四百万亩早稻一类禾和二类禾占90％以上。许多农民说，今年早稻高得盖过人头，密得连青蛙想出来都找不到路。有人更以“投蛋其上，不摇不坠”来形容早稻的茁壮。面对一片丰收景象，绝大部分干部和群众头脑清醒，他们抱定“不打到囤里不算丰收”的决心，有灾救灾，无灾防灾，使丰收更有保证。
    南昌专区和九江专区在5月份全力战胜了洪水灾害后，6月份许多地方出现旱象，于是这些地区的人民又紧张动员起来投入抗旱斗争。九江专区的彭泽、瑞昌、湖口等县，每天有七万多人、二万多架水车日夜抗旱，大部分受旱禾苗已经抢救出来。与抗旱的同时，一些未受旱的地区也动员起来做好了防旱准备。吉安专区和赣南行政区部分早稻发生了虫灾，受灾面积达三十万亩以上。这些地区抓紧时机、紧急动员，在几天内就基本消灭了虫灾。遂川县有一万多亩早稻遭到虫灾，全县马上出动了两万多人，逐丘检查，逐丘捕灭，三天内将虫害一扫而光。为了防治可能发生的病虫害，兴国、信丰、南昌等二十几个县已经层层建立了防虫指挥机构，并准备了充足的药械，提出哪里发现有虫就把虫消灭在哪里。上饶专区的乐平、贵溪、波阳等县，最近乡乡社社认真地调查和估算了今年早稻的产量，认为今年早稻是空前大丰收。但他们并不满足于此，这几个县已经动员起来，决定在收割前的二十多天中再搞一个突击运动：全力消灭三类禾，加强田间管理，做好防虫、防旱、防汛、防倒伏的四防工作，以争取更大的丰收。有些县鉴于往年稻子收到禾场里还遭受了风雨雹灾，现在已动手搭盖田间临时防雨棚和临时防雨仓库。
