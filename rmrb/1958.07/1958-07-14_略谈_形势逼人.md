    A Brief Discussion on "The Situation Forces People"
    Ren Junmo

    Today, almost everyone living in our society feels the power of the times, the so-called "situation forces people." Especially since the Great Leap Forward, the rapid development and changes in the situation, and the turbulent social trends have impacted every corner. However, it is said that some people believe that this is entirely people creating tension themselves, which is disrupting the order of life and violating the laws of social development. This is the same line of argument as those who ridicule us for "being fond of great achievements and anticipating future events," except that it has an extra tail of "order" and "law," disguising itself as more of a "scholar."

    For those accustomed to taking leisurely strolls and content with conventional life, the current situation has indeed disrupted their "order" and violated their "routine," making them feel as if they are sitting on pins and needles. The order of life has been disrupted; they have to move, whether they want to or not. They are constantly moving, constantly changing, and cannot stop for a moment, which is really quite tense.

    However, we say that this is precisely a new normal, a new order, just as Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his work report to the Eighth National Congress, "This is a revolutionary routine that we should welcome with both hands."

    There is no need to be surprised. Have we not learned a little about dialectical materialism? Doesn't dialectics tell us that "objective existence determines ideological consciousness"? What is our "objective" situation today? It is that "over 600 million people have long been in a state of poverty and lack of culture, and can only barely maintain a very low standard of living with great effort, unable to effectively resist natural disasters and unable to quickly stop possible foreign aggression" (Liu Shaoqi's report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress). How can such an objective situation not force people to abandon outdated customs and establish revolutionary routines, exert full effort, strive for the upstream, and build our socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results? This is entirely the inevitable result of objective development, and no one can or can possibly create it out of thin air.

    As early as 1949, Chairman Mao warned us: "Some things that we are familiar with are about to become idle, and things that we are not familiar with are forcing us to do." Chairman Mao's words truly revealed the laws of social development. The beauty lies in the phrase "forcing us to do," the objective situation is to "force" people.

    Now the objective situation in our country is that the people have taken their destiny into their own hands, and under the leadership of the Party, they are transforming life, transforming society, and transforming the world in accordance with objective laws and their own wishes. This is the general trend, the will of the people. In this turbulent torrent, either forge ahead bravely and strive for the upstream, or go with the flow and be washed away to the muddy bottom downstream. It is impossible to go slowly, neither good nor bad, and be content in the middle stream.

    略谈“形势逼人”
    任君默
    今天，生活在我们这个社会里的人，几乎没有一个人不感到时代的力量，所谓形势逼人。特别是大跃进以来，形势发展之快，变化之速，社会潮流之激宕，任何角落都逃不脱它的冲击。但据说，有的人认为这完全是人们自己在制造紧张，这是破坏生活秩序，违反社会发展规律云云。这和那些讥讽我们“好大喜功，现在办将来的事”的论调，可以说是一路货色，只不过多了一条“秩序”“规律”的尾巴，把自己装扮得更像一个“学者”而已。
    对于那些习惯于迈四方步的人，安于常规生活的人，眼前的形势，的确是破坏了他们的“秩序”，违反了他们的“常规”；使他们大有形势之紧，如“芒刺在背”之感。生活的秩序被打乱了，动也得动，不动也得动，天天动，时时变，一刻也停不下来，实在紧张得够呛的。
    然而我们说，这正是一种新的常规，新的秩序，正如刘少奇同志在“八大”工作报告中说的“这是我们应当双手欢迎的一种革命的常规”。
    这完全用不着奇怪，我们不是学过一点唯物主义辩证法吗？辩证法不是告诉我们：“客观存在决定思想意识”吗？今天，我们的“客观”是怎样的呢？那就是“六亿多人长期处在贫穷和缺少文化的状况下，用很大的努力才能勉强维持很低的生活水平，不能有效地抵抗自然灾害，不能迅速地制止可能的外来侵略”（刘少奇同志在“八大”二次会议上的报告）。这样的客观形势又怎能不逼人抛弃陈规陋习，建立革命的常规，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设我们的社会主义呢？这完全是客观发展的必然结果，任何人不会也不可能凭空制造得出来的。
    毛主席早在1949年就警告过我们：“我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西，正在强迫我们去做。”毛主席这几句话，真是一语道破社会发展规律的。妙在“强迫我们去做”这句话，客观形势就是要“强迫”人的。
    现在我们国家的客观形势，是人民自己掌握了自己的命运，人民在党的领导之下，按照客观的规律同时又是自己的愿望去改造生活、改造社会、改造世界。这是大势所趋，人心所向。在这个激宕的洪流里，要么就是急流勇进，力争上游；要么就是顺流而下，被冲没到下游泥底。想慢慢来，不好不坏，安于中游，那是不可能的。
