    The Disintegrating Baghdad Pact Organization
    The Baghdad Pact Organization is an aggressive military bloc cobbled together by Britain and the United States in the Middle East, aimed at splitting the unity of Arab countries and suppressing national independence movements in the Middle East. After World War II, American and British imperialism began planning to organize an aggressive military bloc in the strategically important Middle East. In October 1951, the United States colluded with Britain, France, and Turkey to jointly initiate the organization of a "Middle East Command." This plan was frustrated due to widespread opposition from countries in the Near and Middle East. In April 1954, under the planning of the United States, Turkey and Pakistan signed a military and economic cooperation agreement, which was a prelude to the Baghdad Pact Organization. In February 1955, Turkey and Iraq signed the "Mutual Cooperation Treaty" in Baghdad. In April of the same year, Britain joined the Baghdad Pact, and Pakistan and Iran also joined in September and October of the same year, respectively. In November 1955, the five member countries of the Baghdad Pact held their first council meeting in Baghdad, officially establishing the Baghdad Pact Organization.
    The highest body of the Baghdad Pact Organization is the Standing Ministerial Council of the treaty participants. The Council has a Secretariat, a Military Committee, an Economic Committee, and a so-called "Counter-Subversion Committee" for subversive activities. The Council has held four meetings since 1955.
    The United States is not nominally a member of the Baghdad Pact, but in practice, the United States has always been the planner and instigator of the conspiracy activities of this treaty organization. When the Baghdad Pact Organization held its first council meeting in November 1955, the United States sent observers to attend and decided to send permanent representatives. At the second meeting held in April 1956, the United States decided to join the organization's Economic Committee and Counter-Subversion Committee, and established a military liaison group at the treaty headquarters. In 1957, after the United States put forward the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to fill the "vacuum" left by Britain and France and dominate the Middle East, it further announced its participation in the Military Committee. On January 27 this year, when the Baghdad Pact Organization held its fourth council meeting, the United States sent an "observation group" headed by Dulles to participate in the meeting. Dulles announced that the United States "will wholeheartedly undertake the obligations of the Baghdad Pact."
    Since American and British imperialism cobbled together the Baghdad Pact Organization, they have been using this military bloc to expand its member states, force member states to expand their armaments and prepare for war, and carry out conspiracy activities to interfere in the internal affairs of Arab national independent countries and other Asian and African countries. The Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council held in January this year plotted to link the Baghdad Pact with the North Atlantic Treaty and the Southeast Asia Treaty, prepare to establish American rocket bases on the territory of the member states of this treaty, and attempt to drag Lebanon and Jordan into the Baghdad Pact Organization. This military bloc is a serious threat to the independence and freedom of the Arab people and to peace in the Middle East. President Nasser once accused that: "The Baghdad Pact is a large prison for the Arab people."
    However, after the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, the announcement of its withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact, meant that there were no longer any Arab countries among the members of the Baghdad Pact, giving a fatal blow to the imperialist conspiracy to use the Baghdad Pact to split and invade Arab countries.

    瓦解中的巴格达条约组织
    巴格达条约组织是英美在中东拼凑的侵略性军事集团，其目的是企图分裂阿拉伯国家的团结，镇压中东民族独立运动。美英帝国主义在第二次世界大战后就开始策划在具有战略地位的中东地区组织侵略性的军事集团。1951年10月，美国纠合英、法、土耳其三国共同发起组织“中东司令部”，由于受到中近东国家的普遍反对，这个计划受到了挫折。1954年4月，在美国的策划下土耳其和巴基斯坦签订了军事和经济合作协定，这是巴格达条约组织的前奏。1955年2月，土耳其和伊拉克在巴格达签订了“互助合作条约”。同年4月，英国参加了巴格达条约，巴基斯坦和伊朗也分别在同年9月和10月加入。1955年11月，巴格达条约的五个成员国在巴格达举行了第一次理事会，正式成立了巴格达条约组织。
    巴格达条约组织的最高机构是条约参加国常设部长级理事会。理事会下设秘书处、军事委员会、经济委员会和进行颠复活动的所谓
  “反颠复委员会”。理事会会议自1955年以来已举行过四次。
    美国在名义上不是巴格达条约的成员国，但在实际上美国却一直是这个条约组织的阴谋活动的策划者和主使者。1955年11月，巴格达条约组织举行第一次理事会时，美国派了观察员出席，并决定派遣常驻代表。在1956年4月举行的第二次会议时，美国又决定参加这个组织的经济委员会和反颠复委员会，并在条约总部设立了一个军事联络组。1957年美国提出填补英法“真空”、独霸中东的“艾森豪威尔主义”后，进一步宣布参加军事委员会。今年1月27日，巴格达条约组织举行第四次理事会时，美国派遣了以杜勒斯为首的“观察团”参加会议。杜勒斯宣布：美国“将全心全意地承担巴格达条约的义务”。
    美英帝国主义拼凑巴格达条约组织以来，一直利用这个军事集团进行扩大成员国，强迫各成员国扩军备战，和干涉阿拉伯民族独立国家和其他亚非国家内政的阴谋活动。今年1月举行的巴格达条约理事会安卡拉会议，就阴谋策划把巴格达条约同北大西洋公约和东南亚条约联系起来，准备在这个条约的成员国领土上建立美国火箭基地，并企图把黎巴嫩和约旦拖进巴格达条约组织。这个军事集团对阿拉伯各国人民的独立自由和中东和平是一个严重的威胁。纳赛尔总统曾指责说：“巴格达条约是阿拉伯各国人民的大监狱”。
    但是，伊拉克共和国成立后，宣布退出巴格达条约，使巴格达条约成员国再没有任何一个阿拉伯国家，给了帝国主义利用巴格达条约分裂和侵略阿拉伯国家的阴谋以致命的打击。    （汝厚）
