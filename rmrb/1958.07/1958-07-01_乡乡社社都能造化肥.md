Communes Everywhere Can Produce Fertilizer
Commentator of this newspaper

"Laborers are the most intelligent" – this simple truth has once again been vividly and powerfully proven: ordinary laborers – ordinary workers and ordinary farmers – in Shanxi, Henan, Qinghai, Sichuan, Jilin, Shandong, and many other places have manufactured chemical fertilizers themselves.

That ordinary laborers can manufacture chemical fertilizers themselves is a major event in China's socialist construction. It not only opens up ample sources of fertilizer for China's great leap forward in agriculture and provides an important condition for a greater leap forward in agricultural production, but also fundamentally shatters the mysterious view of the fertilizer industry and opens the door to a large increase in chemical fertilizer production. When the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "the whole Party and the whole people running industry," many people held a skeptical attitude. They believed: "Industry is science. If the whole people run industry, can farmers also run industry!" Ordinary laborers themselves, due to centuries of feudal rule and enslaving education, also lacked confidence in implementing the Party's policy. Many of them said, "We haven't drunk as much ink as they have. I'm afraid it won't work to run industry."

Laborers are, after all, laborers. When they have been educated by the general line, when they understand the principle that "things are done by people, and the subjective initiative of the people is a great driving force," they quickly abandon the sense of inferiority imposed on them by the rulers and imperialist powers, and stand tall in the face of life with the magnificent posture of "opening roads through mountains and rivers, here I come!" Countless agricultural product processing industries have been established, countless agricultural tool repair and manufacturing plants have been established, and thousands upon thousands of coal kilns, iron smelting plants, and small steel plants have appeared in the vast countryside and the most remote mountains. Young people with "no hair on their lips" have become experts in eradicating termites, and "illiterate" peasants, even "housewives" who were once thought to only be able to wash clothes, cook, and give birth to children, have become special researchers at the Academy of Sciences. Not long ago, chemical industries such as reactive dyes and chemical fertilizers, which were considered synonymous with "magic" and "incomprehensible," have also been invented and created by ordinary laborers – workers and farmers.

The question of construction speed is the most important and primary issue facing the people of the whole country after the victory of the socialist revolution. China is a large agricultural country, and the development speed of agricultural production occupies a particularly important position in all of China's socialist construction. Many facts in recent years have repeatedly proved that a bumper harvest in agriculture can promote a leap forward in industry, while a poor harvest will affect industrial development. What does accelerating agricultural development rely on? It relies on selecting superior varieties, deep plowing and close planting, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and strengthening field management, and so on. But more importantly, it is water and fertilizer. People cannot maintain life and health without food, and crops cannot grow vigorously without water and fertilizer. Chinese farmers have always attached great importance to water and fertilizer. The great leap forward in agriculture that was launched last winter and this spring, centered first on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns, was not without reason. Judging from the achievements already obtained, the solution to China's water conservancy problem will not be too difficult. A high tide of water conservancy construction last winter and this spring expanded the irrigated area by more than 350 million mu. With one, two, or three more high tides of water conservancy, the water conservancy problems of farmland will be solved. But whether the fertilizer problem can be fundamentally solved in the same short period of time is something that many people are not confident about. Indeed, our fertilizer accumulation campaign has also achieved great results. A high tide of fertilizer accumulation last winter and this spring accumulated 310 billion dan of various fertilizers. Such an achievement is unprecedented in Chinese history. However, in order to strive for greater development of China's agricultural production, we need more fertilizer, and we need a more reliable source of fertilizer other than natural fertilizer. Organic fertilizer, soil fertilizer, and miscellaneous fertilizer are a very important type of fertilizer and a very important source of fertilizer in our country. Although the quantity of this fertilizer has grown rapidly in recent years, it is ultimately limited. Only chemical fertilizer has this advantage. It is not only many times more effective than natural fertilizer, but also not as restricted by so many conditions as natural fertilizer. It can be manufactured and produced all year round.

The Party and the government attach great importance to establishing China's chemical fertilizer industry. However, China's past chemical fertilizer industrial base was too poor, and the current demand for fertilizer is very large. Newly built modern fertilizer factories cannot meet the needs of farmland across the country all at once. What should we do? The only path is still to rely on the masses, from small to large, from simple to complex, and run the fertilizer industry on a large scale. The experience of many places in Shanxi, Sichuan, and other provinces is like this. As long as these experiences are widely promoted, China's chemical fertilizer problem can and will be solved in a short time.

The success of local self-made chemical fertilizer is a very huge achievement in China's agricultural technology revolution. It has opened up a path for China to fundamentally solve the fertilizer problem and provided an important material guarantee for the high-speed development of China's agriculture. In Qingxu County, Shanxi Province, every township and commune runs fertilizer factories, and the fertilizer problem has been fundamentally solved. The fertilizer they produce can increase grain production by 150 million jin a year, enough for 400,000 people to eat all year round. China has a total of more than 1.69 billion mu of arable land. If all of them can increase production like Qingxu County, how many billions of jin of grain can be increased? If one season of crops can increase so much grain, then how much can two or three seasons increase? The raw materials for manufacturing chemical fertilizer are very abundant in various parts of China. There are a large number of saline-alkali lands in North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China, which produce a large amount of saltpeter soil. As long as the experience of Qingxu County in using saltpeter soil to make chemical fertilizer is promoted, a large amount of chemical fertilizer can be obtained. China has a very long coastline, and the coastal provinces have inexhaustible seawater. As long as the method of using seawater to make chemical fertilizer in Shandong is promoted, a great deal of chemical fertilizer can also be obtained. Other raw materials such as peat, sulfur, animal bones, wood ash, horse manure, and many other materials that can be used to manufacture chemical fertilizer are available almost everywhere in the country. As long as the experience of Qinghai, Sichuan, and other provinces is promoted, a large amount of chemical fertilizer can be manufactured everywhere in the country.

The significance of the success of local self-made chemical fertilizer also lies in the fact that it has completely shattered the mysterious view of the chemical fertilizer industry. No technology? The places that are now able to make fertilizer themselves originally had no technology either. Those who have mastered the technology of manufacturing fertilizer are also ordinary laborers, ordinary workers and farmers. Their facts have proved that it is not difficult to learn and master the technology of manufacturing chemical fertilizer. An ordinary farmer can completely learn it in just three or two days or even a few hours. No equipment, no funds? This does not require any special equipment. Just a few ordinary water vats and a few ordinary iron pots for cooking are enough. It only costs 300 yuan to build a factory in Qingxu County that produces 6,000 to 10,000 jin of fertilizer per day.

Raw materials are available everywhere, and it can be made everywhere; the technology is not mysterious, and everyone can learn it; no additional equipment is needed, and not much money is needed – this is the experience created by the pioneers of local self-made chemical fertilizer for the people of the whole country. Promoting these experiences, turning these experiences into the wealth of the people of the whole country, can make China's chemical fertilizer a great leap forward, can fundamentally solve China's fertilizer problem, and can promote China's agricultural production to move forward at a higher speed.

    乡乡社社都能造化肥

    “劳动者最聪明”这条简单的真理，又一次被生动有力的证明了：山西、河南、青海、四川、吉林、山东以及其他很多地方的普通劳动者——普通工人和普通农民，自己制造出了化学肥料。
    普通劳动者能够自己制造化学肥料，是我国社会主义建设事业中一件大事。它不仅为我国农业大跃进开辟了充足的肥源，为农业生产的更大跃进提供了一个重要的条件，并且从根本上破灭了化肥工业的神秘观点，打开了化学肥料大增产的大门。党中央提出“全党全民办工业”的方针时，有不少人抱怀疑态度，他们认为：“工业是科学，全民办工业，农民也能办工业么！”劳动者自己，由于千百年来的封建统治和奴化教育，对执行党的这个方针也有不少人信心不足，他们说：“咱喝的水还不如人家喝的墨水多，办工业恐怕不行吧。”
    劳动者毕竟是劳动者，当他们受到了总路线的教育以后，当他们懂得了“事在人为，人民群众的主观能动性是一个伟大的动力”的道理以后，很快便抛弃了统治者和帝国主义强加在自己头上的自卑感，以“三山五岳开道，我来了！”的雄伟姿态，顶天立地地站在生活面前了。数不清的农产品加工工业建立起来了，数不清的农具修配厂和制造厂建立起来了，成千上万的煤窑、炼铁厂、小型钢厂出现在广大农村和最偏僻的山野。“嘴上没毛”的青年成了根治白蚁的专家，“目不识丁”的农民甚至被认为只会洗衣、作饭、生孩子的“家庭妇女”成了科学院的特约研究员。不久以前还被人们认为“神奇”、“不可理解”的同义语的化学工业如活性染料、化学肥料等等，也被普通的劳动者——工人农民发明和创造出来了。
    建设速度的问题，是社会主义革命胜利后摆在全国人民面前最重要最主要的问题。我国是一个农业大国，农业生产的发展速度又在我国全部的社会主义建设事业中占着特别重要的地位。几年来许多的事实已经在在证明：农业丰收就能促进工业跃进，农业歉收又会影响工业发展。加快农业发展速度依靠什么呢？依靠选用优良品种、深耕密植、防除病虫害和加强田间管理等等。但是更重要的还是水和肥。人不吃饭便不能维持生命和健康，庄稼缺水少肥也不能茁壮生长。我国农民从来就非常重视水和肥的。去冬今春掀起的农业大跃进，首先以水利建设和积肥运动为中心开展起来，不是没有道理的。从已经获得的成就看来，我国水利问题的解决不会是太大的困难问题，去冬今春一个水利建设高潮，就扩大了灌溉面积三亿五千多万亩，再来它一、两个，三、两个水利高潮，农田的水利问题也就解决了。但在同样短的时间内能不能根本解决肥料问题，很多人心里就不托底了。的确，我们的积肥运动也收到了极大的效果，去冬今春一个积肥高潮，就积集了各种肥料三千一百亿担。这样的成绩在我国历史上是空前的。但是，为了争取我国农业生产的更大发展，我们还需要更多的肥料，需要除自然肥料以外的更可靠的肥源。有机肥料和土肥、杂肥，是我国一种很重要的肥料，很重要的肥源，这种肥料的数量在最近几年中虽然增长很快，但是它毕竟是有限度的。只有化学肥料具备着这种优点，它不仅肥效比自然肥料大许多倍，也不像自然肥料那样受着那么多的条件限制，一年到头都能制造都能生产。
    党和政府是十分重视建立我国的化学肥料工业的。但是，我国过去的化学肥料工业基础太差，而目前对化肥的需要量又很大，新建的现代化肥工厂不能一下子满足全国农田的需要。怎么办呢？唯一的道路仍然是依靠群众，从小到大、从简单到复杂，大办化肥工业。山西、四川等省很多地方的经验就是这样的，只要把这些经验普遍推广，我国化学肥料的问题也可以而且一定能够短时间内获得解决的。
    各地自制化学肥料的成功，是我国农业技术革命中一个十分巨大的成就，它为我国从根本上解决肥料问题开拓了道路，为我国农业的高速度发展提供了重要的物质保证。山西清徐县乡乡社社办化肥厂，肥料问题便根本解决了。他们生产的化肥，一年就可增产一亿五千万斤粮食，够四十万人全年食用。我国共有十六亿九千多万亩耕地，如果都能像清徐县那样增产，共可增产多少亿斤粮食呢？一季作物就能增这么多粮食，那么两季、三季又能增产多少呢？制造化学肥料的原料在我国各地都很丰富，华北、东北和西北各地有大量的盐碱地，出产大量的硝土，只要推广清徐县用硝土制化肥的经验，就能获得大量的化学肥料；我国海岸线很长，沿海各省有取之不尽、用之不竭的海水，只要推广山东用海水造化肥的办法，也能得到极多的化学肥料；其他如泥炭、硫磺、兽骨、草木灰、马粪以及其他许多能够制造化肥的原料，几乎全国到处都有，只要推广青海、四川等省的经验，全国到处就都能制造出大量的化学肥料。
    各地自制化学肥料成功的意义，还在于它彻底地打破了对化学肥料工业的神秘观点。没有技术么？现在已经能够自制化肥的地方原来也没有技术，那些已经掌握了制造化肥技术的人，也都是普通的劳动者普通的工人农民。他们的事实已经证明，学会和掌握制造化学肥料的技术并不难，一个普通的农民，只需三、两天甚至几个钟头就可以完全学会了。没有设备、没有资金么？这也用不着什么特殊的设备，只要几个盛水的普通水缸，几口平常作饭的铁锅就行了。清徐县建一个日产六千斤到一万斤化肥的厂子，统共才需要三百元。
    到处有原料，处处都能造；技术不神秘，人人都能学；不用添设备，不用多少钱——这就是各地自制化学肥料的先行者们为全国人民创造的经验。推广这些经验，使这些经验变成全国人民的财富，就能使我国的化学肥料大跃进，就能从根本上解决我国的肥料问题，就能够促进我国农业生产以更高的速度向前猛进。
