    Simple Telephone Conference Device

    The Jingchuan County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau has successfully trial-produced a simple telephone conference amplifier. After long-distance and intra-county township and commune testing, the volume was proven to be good. This equipment is very simple, made with only one choke coil, one electron tube, a potentiometer made of five carbon resistors, one capacitor, and one loudspeaker. The cost per set is about fifteen yuan, while general telephone conference equipment costs four hundred yuan.
