Khrushchev's Reply to Mr. Macmillan

Prime Minister,

I have received your reply to my letter of July 19th. I have also received replies from Mr. Nehru, Mr. Eisenhower, and Mr. de Gaulle.

I do not wish to argue now about what caused the tension and threatened peace in the Middle East. The Soviet government's view on these matters has already been stated in my letter of July 19th.

The Soviet government believes that the threat to world peace is now extremely serious and that all possible urgent measures must be taken to prevent a world conflict. We cannot diminish the danger of such a conflict, as some are now advocating expanding the zone of aggression in the Middle East and are primarily planning a military offensive against Iraq.

It is precisely to prevent such a conflict that the Soviet Union has proposed the immediate convening of a summit conference of the Soviet, British, American, French, and Indian governments, with the participation of the UN Secretary-General.

We are gratified to learn that the Soviet government's proposal for a summit conference has been met with a positive response from you. It is clear from your letter that the British government advocates that the heads of government meet within the framework of the UN Security Council to discuss the current situation in the Middle East. The Soviet government has already pointed out in its letter of July 19 that it believes that the Security Council should not be bypassed. It is clear from the replies of the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of France that they also wish to hold such a meeting.

In view of the urgent need to take decisions to maintain peace, the Soviet government believes that the form of a summit conference cannot be of decisive significance in this situation. What is important is to hold such a meeting as soon as possible in order to find the right solutions as quickly as possible to maintain and consolidate peace, stabilize the situation in the Middle East, and ease international tensions.

We agree with your view on the method of discussing this issue at a special meeting of the Security Council with the participation of heads of government. We agree that no resolutions should be put forward that have not been agreed upon in advance, and that the purpose of our joint work is to reach fruitful agreements, not to determine differences by means of voting.

The Soviet government's starting point is that, in order to achieve the most rapid and constructive solutions conducive to maintaining and consolidating peace, the heads of government will, as your letter states, be able to conduct joint consultations that are not limited to formal procedures.

Since the Security Council is currently discussing issues that are not general routine matters, but issues of particular importance from the perspective of maintaining peace and ensuring security, we believe it would be beneficial to include India in the Security Council's meetings, as India is a major Asian country and is a country recognized as advocating the consolidation of peace. Unlike the participation of a so-called permanent member of the Security Council who actually represents no one, India's participation would be truly beneficial. We believe it is necessary for Indian Prime Minister Nehru to attend the Security Council meeting as the representative of India. We thank him for having already agreed to attend the summit conference.

We are gratified to learn that you, Prime Minister, are prepared to travel to New York to attend the special meeting of the Security Council with the participation of heads of government. As for the Soviet Union, given that you have agreed, and that French Prime Minister de Gaulle, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, and US President Eisenhower have agreed (according to his letter of July 22), the Soviet Union will be represented at this meeting by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

It goes without saying that the Security Council, when discussing issues with the participation of the heads of government of the aforementioned five countries, should include the participation of the governments of the relevant Arab countries.

The Soviet government hopes to learn as soon as possible the British government's views on the date for convening the Security Council meeting with the participation of heads of government. We propose that the Security Council meeting be held in New York on July 28.

With respect,

N. Khrushchev

### 赫鲁晓夫给麦克米伦的回信

专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫给麦克米伦的回信首相先生：
    我收到你对我7月19日的信的回信。我还收到了尼赫鲁先生、艾森豪威尔先生和戴高乐先生的回信。
    现在我不想争辩是什么原因引起了紧张局势和给中近东地区和平造成了威胁。苏联政府对这些问题的看法已经在我7月19日的信中讲过了。
    苏联政府认为，现在世界和平受到的威胁极其严重，必须采取最紧急的一切可能的措施来防止世界冲突。我们不能缩小这种冲突的危险性，因为现在有人主张扩大在中近东的侵略区，而且首先在策划对伊拉克的军事进攻。
    正因为要防止发生这种冲突，苏联才建议立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、英、美、法和印度政府首脑会议。
    我们满意地得悉，苏联政府关于各国政府首脑会议的建议得到了您的积极响应。从您的信中可以看出，英国政府主张各国政府首脑在联合国安理会的范围内举行会议来讨论目前中近东的局势。苏联政府在它7月19日的信中已经指出，它认为，不应该不通过安理会。从美国总统和法国总理的复信可以看出，他们也希望举行这种会议。
    鉴于必须采取紧急决定来维护和平，苏联政府认为，政府首脑会议的形式在这种情况下，不可能有决定性意义。重要的是尽可能早地举行这种会议，以便尽快地找出正确的解决办法来维护和巩固和平，安定中近东地区的局面，缓和国际紧张局势。
    我们同意您关于在有政府首脑参加的安理会特别会议讨论这个问题的办法的意见。我们同意，不应提出任何未经事先商妥的决议，我们共同工作的目的是达成会有成效的协议，而不是用表决的方式确定分歧。
    苏联政府的出发点是，各国政府首脑为了取得有利于维护和巩固和平的最迅速的建设性的解决办法，将如同您的信中所说的，将有可能进行不只是通过正式程序的共同磋商。
    既然当前安全理事会要讨论的不是一般的日常问题，而是从维护和平和保障安全的角度看来特别重要的问题，因此我们认为，吸收印度参加安全理事会的会议是有好处的，因为印度是一个亚洲大国，是一个被公认为主张巩固和平的国家。与实际上不代表任何人的一个所谓安全理事会常任理事国的参加不同，印度的参加是会真正有好处的。我们认为有必要让印度总理尼赫鲁作为印度代表来参加安全理事会的会议。尼赫鲁已经同意参加各国政府首脑会议，我们对这点向他表示感谢。
    我们满意地获悉，您，首相先生，准备前往纽约参加有各国政府首脑参加的安全理事会特别会议。至于苏联，鉴于您已经同意，法国总理戴高乐、印度总理尼赫鲁和美国总统艾森豪威尔已经同意（根据他的7月22日的信件），苏联将由部长会议主席作为代表出席这次会议。
    不言而喻，安理会在上述五国政府首脑参加下讨论问题时应当吸收有关阿拉伯国家政府参加。
    苏联政府希望尽快得知英国政府对于召开有各国政府首脑参加的安理会会议日期的意见。我们建议7月28日在纽约举行安理会会议。
                    此致敬意　　　　尼·赫鲁晓夫
      1958年7月23日　莫斯科
