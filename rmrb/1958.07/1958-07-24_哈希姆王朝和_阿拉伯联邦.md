The Iraqi people, after overthrowing the Faisal dynasty, declared their withdrawal from the "Arab Federation," which is a heavy blow to the US-British imperialist conspiracy to use Iraq to invade the Middle East.

The Faisal dynasty, overthrown by the Iraqi people, and the now-shaky Hussein dynasty of Jordan, both belong to the descendants of the Hashemite dynasty. The "Arab Federation" was established by Iraq and Jordan in February of this year.

The Hashemite dynasty was originally a family in the Arab nation, claiming to be direct descendants of Muhammad, the founder of Islam. The founder of this dynasty was Sharif Hussein, the leader of the Hashemite family and the Grand Sharif of Islam in Hejaz (now part of Saudi Arabia). From the 11th century, this family ruled the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Sharif Hussein always attempted to establish an Arab empire. During World War I, under British instigation, Sharif Hussein declared war on Turkey in 1916 and sent his third son, Faisal, to lead troops into Damascus (now the capital of the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic).

After World War I, the Ottoman Empire disintegrated. Britain supported Sharif Hussein as the King of Hejaz. But at the same time, Britain colluded with Ibn Saud, the chief of Nejd (also part of present-day Saudi Arabia), to provoke the relationship between Hussein and Saud. In order to control the entire Arabian Peninsula, Britain instigated Hussein to annex territory, causing armed conflicts between Hussein and Saud. In 1924, Saud occupied Hejaz, drove Hussein out of the Arabian Peninsula, and unified Saudi Arabia. In 1926, Saud proclaimed himself king. In 1932, the country was renamed the "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."

After Sharif Hussein was driven out of the Arabian Peninsula, Britain supported his third son, Faisal, as the King of Iraq in 1921. Faisal died in Switzerland in 1933 and was succeeded by his son, Faisal II. At that time, Faisal II was only four years old and was represented by his uncle, Prince Regent Abdul Ilah, until he officially ascended the throne in May 1953. Ilah was also killed by the people in this Iraqi revolution.

While supporting Faisal as the King of Iraq, Britain also supported Sharif Hussein's second son, Abdullah, as the Emir of Transjordan. In 1946, Britain granted Jordan nominal independence according to the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty of London, with Abdullah as the first king. In 1948, Jordan participated in the Palestine War. After the war, Jordan officially annexed the Arab region of eastern Palestine and changed its name to the "Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan." Abdullah was loyal to Britain and opposed American infiltration into Jordan, resulting in his assassination by a pro-American terrorist group in 1951. The throne was passed to his son, Talal. But the Americans' victory was temporary. In 1952, the Jordanian cabinet, under the direction of British General Glubb (the Chief of General Staff of the Jordanian Army and Commander of the Arab Legion, who was expelled in 1956), announced that Talal's health was very poor and that he could not continue to rule the country. The Jordanian Parliament then announced the appointment of his son, Hussein, to succeed to the throne.

The descendants of these two Hashemite dynasties, manipulated by imperialism, have become tools for US and British imperialism to enslave Iraq and Jordan, invade the Middle East, and divide the unity of Arab countries. On February 14th of this year, US and British imperialism planned the formation of the so-called "Arab Federation" by Iraq and Jordan. Nominally, this federation was built on the foundation of the Hashemite dynasty, but in reality, it is a product of the Baghdad Pact and the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and is a thorough tool for imperialist aggression in the Middle East.

When the "Arab Federation" was established, Iraq was a pillar of the Baghdad Pact organization, while Jordan, since the overthrow of its nationalist regime by the United States last April, had accepted the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The United States, under the black banner of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," actually controlled the Baghdad Pact, using Iraq and Jordan as invasion positions to carry out a rampant offensive against the independence and freedom of the Arab people.

The US ruling clique openly stated that the "Arab Federation" is a "unified banner" for its aggression against Arab countries. The "Arab Federation" was used to oppose the United Arab Republic, undermine the unity of the people of Arab countries, and weaken Arab nationalist forces. According to the agreement and constitution of the "Arab Federation," not only Iraq and Jordan could form a federation, but other Arab countries could also participate. US and British imperialism clearly attempted to use this federation to annex other Arab countries and expand the imperialist invasion positions in Arab countries.

The establishment of the Arab Federation signified the imperialist attempt to strengthen its control over these two countries, especially Jordan. After the Jordanian nationalist regime was overthrown, the rule of the Jordanian Hussein dynasty, loyal to imperialism, remained very unstable. After the federation was established, they could use Iraq to consolidate the imperialist position in Jordan. The constitution stipulated that the King of Iraq, Faisal, would be the head of the federation. The armies of the two countries would be unified, with the head of the federation serving as the supreme commander. In May, Iraqi troops entered Jordan to help the Jordanian Hussein dynasty suppress domestic nationalist forces.

From the outset, the "Arab Federation" became a tool for imperialist aggression in the Middle East. After the outbreak of the armed uprising by nationalist forces against the Shamoun reactionary government in Lebanon, the imperialists, led by the United States, planned direct military intervention on the one hand, and instructed the "Arab Federation" to send troops to Lebanon to help the reactionary government of Lebanon suppress the people's uprising on the other. Now that the Iraqi people have overthrown the Faisal dynasty, the United States has sent armed forces to invade Lebanon and instigated the Jordanian Hussein dynasty, under the guise of the "Arab Federation," to attack the Republic of Iraq. Britain has also sent armed forces into Jordan, attempting to use Jordan as a springboard for armed intervention in Iraq. At the same time, the US Navy's "Middle East Force" and British troops are also gathering in the Persian Gulf, attempting to coordinate the attack on the Republic of Iraq from the east.

All this shows that the US and British imperialists, sitting on the Middle East volcano, are attempting to use direct armed aggression to stifle the Republic of Iraq, save the collapse of the Hashemite dynasty and the "Arab Federation," and maintain the imperialist colonial system in the Middle East. However, the revolutionary victory of the Iraqi people has forever buried the corrupt and reactionary Faisal dynasty, and the "Arab Federation" has also been sent to the museum of history.

### 哈希姆王朝和“阿拉伯联邦”

    哈希姆王朝和“阿拉伯联邦”
  伊拉克人民推翻了费萨尔王朝后，宣布退出“阿拉伯联邦”，这是对美英帝国主义利用伊拉克侵略中东的阴谋的沉重打击。
    被伊拉克人民推翻了的费萨尔王朝，与现在摇摇欲坠的约旦侯赛因王朝，同属于哈希姆王朝的后裔。“阿拉伯联邦”是伊拉克和约旦在今年2月建立的。
    哈希姆王朝原是阿拉伯民族中的一个家族，自称是伊斯兰教创始人穆罕默德的直系后裔。这个王朝的始祖，是哈希姆家族的首领、汉志（现在是沙特阿拉伯的一部分领土）伊斯兰教大教主沙里夫·侯赛因。从十一世纪起，这个家族就是圣地麦加和麦地那的统治者。沙里夫·侯赛因一直企图建立阿拉伯帝国。第一次世界大战时期，在英国策动下，沙里夫·侯赛因于1916年向土耳其宣战，并派三子费萨尔率领军队攻入大马士革（现在阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区的首府）。
    第一次世界大战后，奥斯曼帝国瓦解。英国扶植沙里夫·侯赛因为汉志王。但同时英国又勾结内志
  （与汉志同属现沙特阿拉伯的领土）酋长伊本·沙特，挑拨侯赛因与沙特的关系。英国为了控制整个阿拉伯半岛，唆使侯赛因向外兼并，引起侯赛因与沙特的武装冲突。1924年，沙特攻占汉志，把侯赛因逐出阿拉伯半岛，统一了沙特阿拉伯。1926年，沙特称王。1932年改国名为“沙特阿拉伯王国”。
    沙里夫·侯赛因被逐出阿拉伯半岛后，英国于1921年扶植他的三子费萨尔为伊拉克国王。费萨尔于1933年死于瑞士，传位给他的儿子费萨尔二世。当时，费萨尔二世只有四岁，由他的叔父同时又是皇太子的阿卜杜勒·伊拉摄政，直到1953年5月，才正式即位。伊拉在这次伊拉克革命中也被人民打死了。
    英国在扶植费萨尔为伊拉克国王的同时，也扶植沙里夫·侯赛因的次子阿卜杜勒为外约旦酋长。1946年，英国根据英—约伦敦条约，给予约旦形式上的独立，由阿卜杜勒任第一位国王。1948年约旦参加了巴勒斯坦战争，战后约旦正式吞并了巴勒斯坦东部阿拉伯地区，并改国名为“哈希姆约旦王国”。阿卜杜勒忠于英国而反对美国渗入约旦，结果于1951年遭到亲美恐怖集团的毒手。王位传给他的儿子泰拉尔。但是美国人的胜利是暂时的。1952年，约旦内阁在英国将军格拉布（1956年被赶走的约旦陆军总参谋长兼阿拉伯军团司令）的指使下，宣布泰拉尔健康情况很坏，不能继续统治国家，约旦议会随即宣布任命他的儿子侯赛因接王位。
    玩弄在帝国主义手掌中的这两个哈希姆王朝的后裔，成为美英帝国主义奴役伊拉克和约旦，侵略中东，并分裂阿拉伯国家的团结的工具。今年2月14日，美英帝国主义策划伊拉克和约旦结成所谓“阿拉伯联邦”。名义上，这个联邦是建立在哈希姆王朝的基础上，实际上它是巴格达条约和“艾森豪威尔主义”的产物，是彻头彻尾的帝国主义侵略中东的工具。
    在“阿拉伯联邦”成立时，伊拉克是巴格达条约组织的一个支柱，而约旦自去年4月民族主义政权被美国颠复后接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”。美国打着“艾森豪威尔主义”的一面黑旗，实际控制着巴格达条约，把伊拉克和约旦作为侵略阵地，向阿拉伯人民的独立自由实行猖狂的进攻。
    美国统治集团公开说，“阿拉伯联邦”是它侵略阿拉伯国家的一面“统一的旗帜”。“阿拉伯联邦”被利用来同阿拉伯联合共和国唱对台戏，破坏阿拉伯各国人民的团结，削弱阿拉伯民族主义力量。根据“阿拉伯联邦”的协定和宪法，不仅由伊拉克和约旦结成联邦，其他阿拉伯国家也可以参加。美英帝国主义显然是企图利用这个联邦来对其他阿拉伯国家实行兼并，扩大帝国主义在阿拉伯国家中的侵略阵地。
    阿拉伯联邦的建立，意味着帝国主义企图加强对这两个国家，特别是对约旦的控制。约旦民族主义政权被颠复后，效忠于帝国主义的约旦侯赛因王朝的统治，仍然很不稳固。联邦成立后，它们就可以由伊拉克来巩固帝国主义在约旦的阵地。宪法规定，伊拉克国王费萨尔为这个联邦的元首。两国军队将统一起来，由联邦元首担任最高司令。5月间，伊拉克军队便进入了约旦，帮助约旦侯赛因王朝镇压国内民族主义力量。
    “阿拉伯联邦”一开始就成为帝国主义侵略中东的工具。黎巴嫩爆发了民族主义力量反对夏蒙反动政府的武装起义后，以美国为首的帝国主义一面策划直接的军事干涉，一面指使“阿拉伯联邦”派遣军队前往黎巴嫩，帮助黎巴嫩的反动政府镇压人民起义。现在，当伊拉克人民推翻了费萨尔王朝后，美国就派遣武装部队侵入黎巴嫩，并策动约旦侯赛因王朝打着“阿拉伯联邦”的幌子，进攻伊拉克共和国。英国也已经派遣武装部队进入约旦，企图把约旦作为武装干涉伊拉克的跳板。与此同时，美国海军“中东部队”和英国部队还向波斯湾集结，企图从东部配合进攻伊拉克共和国。
    这一切说明，坐在中东火山口上的美英帝国主义，正在企图用直接的武装侵略来扼杀伊拉克共和国，挽救哈希姆王朝和“阿拉伯联邦”的崩溃，维护帝国主义在中东的殖民制度。但是，伊拉克人民的革命的胜利，已永远埋葬了腐朽反动的费萨尔王朝，“阿拉伯联邦”也被送进历史博物馆了。

    1957年4月，在约旦首都安曼，人民冲破了警察的包围，坚持了反对侯赛因王朝反动统治的示威游行。
