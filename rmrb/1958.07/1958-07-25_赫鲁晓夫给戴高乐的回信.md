Khrushchev's Reply to De Gaulle

Mr. Prime Minister:

I have received your reply to my letter of July 19th. I have also received replies from Mr. Nehru, Mr. Macmillan, and Mr. Eisenhower. We are pleased to learn from your reply that you agree to direct contact between the heads of government of the major powers on the Middle East issue.

Regarding the causes of the tensions and the threats to peace in the Near and Middle East, the Soviet government's views were stated in my letter of July 19th, and we do not wish to argue about this issue now.

The Soviet government believes that the threat to universal peace is extremely serious and that the most urgent measures must be taken to prevent a world conflict. We cannot diminish the danger of such a conflict, as some are now advocating expanding the area of aggression in the Near and Middle East, and are primarily planning a military offensive against Iraq.

It is precisely to prevent a world conflict that the Soviet Union proposes the immediate convening of a summit conference of the governments of the Soviet Union, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and India, with the participation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. British Prime Minister Macmillan and Indian Prime Minister Nehru both advocate a summit conference within the framework of the Security Council. The President of the United States has also expressed his willingness to hold such a conference. Mr. Prime Minister, it can be concluded from your letter that you are in favor of holding a summit conference to discuss the current situation in the Near and Middle East, and we are pleased with this.

We can accept the British Prime Minister Macmillan's proposal to hold a summit conference within the framework of the Security Council. The Soviet Union pointed out in its letter of July 19 that the Security Council should not be avoided.

In view of the need to take urgent measures to maintain peace, we believe that the form of the summit conference is not of decisive significance in this situation. What is important is to hold this conference as soon as possible in order to find the right solutions as quickly as possible to maintain and consolidate peace, stabilize the situation in the Near and Middle East, and ease international tensions.

We also agree with Mr. Macmillan's proposed approach to the work of this special meeting of the Security Council. We agree with Mr. Macmillan's view that no resolutions should be put forward at this special meeting of the Security Council without prior negotiation. The purpose of the meeting is to reach agreement, not to determine differences by voting.

The Soviet government here proceeds from the fact that the heads of government will be able to conduct joint consultations not only through formal procedures in order to achieve the most rapid and constructive solutions conducive to maintaining and consolidating peace.

Since the current Security Council is not discussing general day-to-day issues, but issues that are particularly important from the point of view of maintaining peace and ensuring security, we believe that it would be beneficial to include India in the meetings of the Security Council. India is a universally recognized major Asian country and a country that advocates the consolidation of peace. Unlike the participation of a so-called permanent member of the Security Council that does not actually represent anyone, India's participation would be truly beneficial. We believe it is necessary for Indian Prime Minister Nehru to attend the Security Council meeting as India's representative. Prime Minister Nehru has agreed to attend the summit, for which we express our gratitude to him.

As for the Soviet Union, since British Prime Minister Macmillan, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, US President Eisenhower, and you, Mr. Prime Minister, have all agreed to personally attend the special meeting of the Security Council (as seen from your letters), the Soviet Union will be represented by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union at this meeting.

It goes without saying that when the Security Council discusses issues with the participation of the heads of government of the above five countries, the governments of the relevant Arab countries should be included.

The Soviet government hopes to hear from the Government of the French Republic as soon as possible regarding the date of the Security Council meeting with the participation of heads of government. We propose that the meeting be held in the Security Council in New York on July 28.

Respectfully,

N. Khrushchev

### 赫鲁晓夫给戴高乐的回信

专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫给戴高乐的回信总理先生：
    我收到了你对我7月19日的信的回信。我还收到了尼赫鲁先生、麦克米伦先生和艾森豪威尔先生的回信。我们满意地从您的复信中获悉，您同意大国政府首脑就中东问题进行直接接触。
    谈到引起紧张局势和给中近东地区和平造成威胁的原因，苏联政府的看法已经在我7月19日的信中说明了，现在我们不想就这个问题进行争论。
    苏联政府认为，现在普遍和平受到的威胁极其严重，必须采取最紧急的一切可能的措施来防止世界冲突。我们不能缩小这种冲突的危险性，因为现在有人主张扩大中近东侵略区，而且首先在策划对伊拉克实行军事进攻。
    正因为要防止发生世界冲突，苏联才建议立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、法、美、英和印度政府首脑会议。英国首相麦克米伦和印度总理尼赫鲁都主张在安全理事会范围内举行政府首脑会议。美国总统也表示愿意举行这种会议。总理先生，从您的信中可以得出结论：您赞成举行政府首脑会议来讨论目前中近东的局势问题，我们对此感到满意。
    英国首相麦克米伦先生提出的在安全理事会范围内召开政府首脑会议的主张，我们是可以接受的。苏联在7月19日的信中已经指出不应当避开安全理事会。
    鉴于必须采取紧急措施来维护和平，我们认为，政府首脑会议的形式在这种情况下没有决定性的意义。重要的是尽可能早地举行这次会议，以便尽快找出正确的解决办法来维护和巩固和平，安定中近东地区的局面，缓和国际紧张局势。
    我们也同意麦克米伦先生提出的对待安全理事会这次特别会议的工作的办法。我们同意麦克米伦先生的意见：在这次特别会议上不应当提出事先未经商妥的任何决议案。会议的目的在于达成协议，而不是用表决的方式确定分歧。
    苏联政府这里的出发点是，各国政府首脑为了取得有利于维护和巩固和平的最迅速的建设性的解决办法，将有可能进行不仅仅通过正式程序的共同磋商。
    既然当前安全理事会要讨论的不是一般的日常问题，而是从维护和平和保障安全的角度看来特别重要的问题，因此我们认为，吸收印度参加安全理事会的会议会有好处的。印度是一个众所公认的亚洲大国，是一个主张巩固和平的国家。与实际上不代表任何人的一个所谓安全理事会常任理事国的参加不同，印度的参加是真正会有好处的。我们认为有必要让印度总理尼赫鲁作为印度代表参加安理会会议。尼赫鲁总理已经同意参加政府首脑会议，为此我们向他表示谢意。
    至于苏联，既然英国首相麦克米伦，印度总理尼赫鲁，美国总统艾森豪威尔和您，总理先生，都同意亲自参加安理会的特别会议，（这从你们的信中看出），苏联将由苏联部长会议主席作为代表出席这次会议。
    不言而喻，安理会在上述五国政府首脑参加下讨论问题时，应当吸收有关阿拉伯国家政府参加。
    苏联政府希望尽快地得知法兰西共和国政府关于举行有政府首脑参加的安理会会议的日期的意见。我们建议7月28日在纽约安理会举行会议。此致敬意　　　　尼·赫鲁晓夫
