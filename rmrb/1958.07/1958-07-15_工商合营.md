    The relationship between industrial and commercial sectors used to be merely a relationship of production and sales, or a relationship of processing orders. The Chengde Special District and two trade units in Tianjin jointly established 200 small blast furnaces, creating a relationship of running "joint state-private industry and commerce" factories between industrial and commercial sectors. This is a good thing for both industrial and commercial sectors. It goes without saying that the industrial sector benefits from the assistance of the commercial sector, accelerating the speed of industrial development. The commercial sector's assistance to the industrial sector in developing industry provides it with a fixed source of goods and many conveniences. It seems that the form of "joint state-private industry and commerce" is well worth promoting.

    “工商合营”
    工业部门和商业部门的关系过去只是产销关系，或者加工订货的关系。承德专区和天津的两个贸易单位合办二百座小高炉，使工业部门和商业部门之间又有了一种办“工商合营”工厂的关系。这对工业部门和商业部门说来，都是件好事。工业部门得到商业部门的帮助，加快了发展工业的速度，好处自不待言。商业部门帮助工业部门发展工业，使得自己有固定的货源，也有不少方便。看来，“工商合营”这种形式，是很值得提倡的。
