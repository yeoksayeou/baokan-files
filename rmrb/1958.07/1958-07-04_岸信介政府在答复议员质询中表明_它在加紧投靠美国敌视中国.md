Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd dispatch: The Kishi Nobusuke government recently stated in response to inquiries from committee members at a meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors that they would adopt a policy of intensifying reliance on the United States and antagonizing China.

    At the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors held on June 30th and July 1st, members of the Japan Socialist Party and independent committee members questioned the Kishi Nobusuke government on the Japanese economic crisis and Sino-Japanese relations.

    Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tatsunosuke Takasaki, admitted in response to questioning that "Judging from the economic situation in April and May, it is very difficult to achieve this year's import and export trade targets, and therefore Japan's industrial and mining production index will also decline accordingly." Socialist Party members Kaneto Matsuzawa, Noriharu Yoshida, and others pointed out at the meeting that the US economic crisis would tend to be protracted. They demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government change its trade structure relying on the United States and balance the trade deficit between Japan and the United States. They also questioned what measures the Kishi Nobusuke government would take to overcome the economic crisis. Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tatsunosuke Takasaki, believed that the US economy would have some "improvement" by this autumn. Based on this estimate, Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency, Takeo Miki, stated that the trade structure relying on the United States could not be changed. Nobusuke Kishi said: A consultation system between Japanese and American financial and business circles is gradually forming, and he expressed that he would carefully study the plan to establish a higher-level Economic Cooperation Committee. Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama stated that the Japanese government would make its best efforts to prevent the United States from excluding Japanese goods. He said, "The government is taking various measures to increase Japanese exports to the United States." Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tatsunosuke Takasaki, also stated that the development of the Japanese economy is not only driven by the US economy. Japan's adoption of credit to develop export trade with Southeast Asian countries can improve Japan's current economic situation to some extent. Socialist Party member Yoshio Nakata pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's adoption of this method shows that the government has no other way. He also pointed out that this method is risky.

    Socialist Party member Noriharu Yoshida raised a series of questions on Sino-Japanese relations. In his inquiry, he pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's strengthening of the "Self-Defense Forces" and actively organizing military groups such as the "Northeast Asia Alliance" all regard China as a strategic target. He accused the Kishi Nobusuke government of spreading the fallacy of "two Chinas" through State Minister Hayato Ikeda and others to antagonize the Chinese government. He also accused the Liberal Democratic Party of planning to dissolve the Japan Diet Members' League for Promotion of Japan-China Trade, which participated in the signing of the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement, and to reorganize the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the Japan-China Import and Export Association, attempting to completely destroy the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement. Nobusuke Kishi could not answer the above questions and had to flatly deny his attitude of antagonizing China, attempting to shirk his responsibility for destroying the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

    岸信介政府在答复议员质询中表明
    它在加紧投靠美国敌视中国
    据新华社2日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府近日在参议院预算委员会的会议上答复委员们的质询中表明，它们要采取加紧投靠美国和敌视中国的政策。
    日本社会党和无党派委员在6月30日和7月1日举行的参议院预算委员会上就日本经济危机和中日关系问题向岸信介政府提出了质询。
    日本通商产业相高碕达之助在答复质询时承认，“从4月和5月的经济情况看来，要达到今年度进出口贸易的目标是非常困难的，因而日本工矿业生产指数也将随着下降”。社会党委员松泽兼人、吉田法晴等人在会上指出，美国经济危机将趋向长期化。他们要求岸信介政府改变依赖美国的贸易结构、平衡日美之间的贸易差额。他们还追问岸信介政府究竟采取什么办法来克服经济危机。通商产业相高碕达之助认为美国经济到了今年秋天多少会有一些“好转”。根据这个估计，经济企划厅长官三木武夫表明不能改变依赖美国的贸易结构。岸信介说：日美金融、实业界人士之间的协商体制正在逐步形成，他表示要好好地研究成立高一级经济合作委员会的计划。日本外相藤山爱一郎表示日本政府将作最大的努力阻止美国排斥日货。他说“政府正在采取各种措施来增加日本对美国的出口”。通商产业相高碕达之助还表示日本经济的发展并不是只受美国经济的推动，日本采取赊账的方式来发展对东南亚各国的出口贸易多少可以改进日本目前的经济状况。社会党议员中田吉雄指出，岸信介政府采取这种办法，表明政府已经没有办法了。他还指出，这种办法是冒险的。
    社会党委员吉田法晴就日中关系问题提出了一系列的质问。他在质询中指出，岸信介政府加强“自卫队”，积极组织“东北亚同盟”这样的军事集团都是把中国当作战略目标。他指责岸信介政府通过国务相池田勇人等人散布“两个中国”的谬论来敌视中国政府的行为。他还指责自由民主党打算解散参加签订第四次日中贸易协定的日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟和改组日本国际贸易促进协会和日中输出入协会，企图彻底破坏第四次日中贸易协定的行为。岸信介对于上述这些问题，无法作出答复，只好矢口抵赖他敌视中国的态度，企图推卸他破坏第四次中日贸易协定的责任。
