    There Should Be a Great Leap Forward in Oil Production
    The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party called on the whole country to vigorously develop oil production and elevate oil crops to the same important position as grain and cotton. This decision correctly reflects the growing objective needs. In the great leap forward of socialist construction, industrial production needs more vegetable oil as raw materials, people's daily life needs more edible oil, and at the same time, with the large increase in oil production, farmers can get more oil cake for feed and fertilizer, and the country can also appropriately increase the export of oil. In the years since liberation, China's vegetable oil production has been increasing continuously, but the growth rate is much slower than that of grain and cotton. In today's great leap forward in grain and cotton production, oil production should not continue to lag behind. Let grain, cotton, and oil production leap forward together—this is a glorious task in current agricultural production.
    In the first half of this year, thanks to the efforts of the vast number of farmers, oil production had a good start, namely, rapeseed achieved a bumper harvest everywhere. The total national summer harvest of rapeseed is expected to increase by about 60% compared with last year. This is a leap forward. However, a leap forward in rapeseed production alone does not equal a leap forward in all oil production. Because the national rapeseed planting area only accounts for 30% of the total area of oil crops (excluding soybeans). The proportion of autumn oil production is much larger than that of rapeseed, such as peanut production, which has always accounted for more than 60% of the total national oil production (excluding soybeans). Therefore, whether the annual oil production can achieve a great leap forward depends on the harvest of autumn oil crops such as peanuts, soybeans, sesame, flax, castor beans, sunflowers, and woody oil crops. Therefore, at present, in terms of oil production, it is still necessary to seize the season, work hard, and strive for a bumper harvest of autumn oil crops.
    Some people do not fully recognize the favorable conditions that can promote the great leap forward in oil production. They exaggerate the contradiction between oil production and grain and cotton production, thinking that if they focus on grain and cotton, they can no longer focus on oil, so they have not actively and comprehensively taken effective measures to ensure the leap forward in oil production, which creates the danger of the oil production leap forward target failing. So, can oil production really leap forward together with grain and cotton production at present? The answer is yes. First, inspired by the General Line, the enthusiasm of farmers across the country for comprehensively accelerating the development of agricultural production is growing. In the second revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, positive unit area yield targets have been set for peanuts, rapeseed, and soybeans, which is a direct encouragement to farmers across the country to accelerate the development of oil production. Second, the state economic departments have taken a series of measures to promote oil production, such as the state's implementation of a differential allocation management method for edible oil to provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, requiring the importing areas to achieve self-sufficiency in oil crops within one to three years; stipulating reasonable parity prices for oil crops and oil cake, changing the unreasonable phenomenon that the price of oil cake is higher than that of oil crops; allowing agricultural cooperatives to operate local oil mills, so that farmers can get oil cake for use in a timely manner, and so on. All of these have also powerfully encouraged the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers to develop oil production. Third, thanks to the strengthening of the leadership of party and government organizations at all levels over oil production, and thanks to the efforts of the vast number of farmers in oil production, not only did they achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest of rapeseed in the first half of this year, but also from the perspective of the sowing work of autumn oil crops, the sowing quality this year is better than in previous years, and many areas have promoted dense planting technology; the amount of fertilizer applied is also greater than in previous years. All of these have laid a good foundation for the increase in autumn oil production. Fourth, many facts have proved that the potential for oil production increase is great, waiting for everyone to vigorously tap it. In the first half of this year, due to the active efforts of various localities to promote rapeseed production increase measures, many cases of large-scale bumper harvests of rapeseed have emerged. If we vigorously grasp the production increase measures of autumn oil crops in the second half of the year and universally promote advanced experience, autumn oil crops will not only increase significantly, but also many typical experiences of high-yield bumper harvests will emerge.
    From the above explanation, it can be seen that the conditions for accelerating the development of oil production are very favorable. As long as we strengthen leadership in accordance with the spirit of comprehensively and rapidly developing agricultural production, we can ensure that oil production leaps forward shoulder to shoulder with grain and cotton production. Hongan County, Hubei Province, last year, in accordance with the specific conditions of the county, implemented the policy of "taking grain and oil production as the mainstay" for the comprehensive development of production, and achieved a double bumper harvest of grain and oil under arid natural conditions. The peanut yield per mu was as high as more than 600 jin, equivalent to four times the average peanut yield per mu in the country, creating an unprecedented high-yield record in China. The experience of Hongan County's comprehensive leap forward in grain and oil is being promoted in many areas. Puyang County, Henan Province, has made tremendous efforts in comprehensively developing grain, cotton, and peanut production this year, and has achieved outstanding results. The slogan of the vast number of farmers in this county is: "Grain rides a satellite, cotton drives a rocket, peanut production increases like lightning!" Puyang County planted more than 168,000 mu of peanuts this year. Since spring, the county leadership organs have mobilized farmers throughout the county to launch a large-scale debate on the leap forward in peanut production, criticizing conservative thinking, tapping production increase potential, learning advanced experience, and adopting a series of measures in production such as deep plowing, leveling the land, applying sufficient base fertilizer, topdressing in stages, popularizing improved varieties, sowing at the right time, and reasonable dense planting. The county party committee also established a peanut production office, which moved to the key peanut production cooperative—Hongxia Agricultural Cooperative—to direct peanut production on the spot. Now the peanuts throughout the county are growing very well. According to the understanding of the staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, Puyang County has a great hope of realizing the "peanut thousand-jin county" this year. The enthusiasm of the leading organs and farmers of Puyang County in developing oil production is worth learning from all over the country.
    From the perspective of the production season, autumn oil crops are currently flowering or about to bear fruit. The most urgent task at present is to thoroughly do a good job in the field management of crops such as peanuts and soybeans. This includes timely mid-cultivation and soil consolidation, topdressing, drought and flood resistance, pest and disease control, and so on. Laiyang Prefecture, a concentrated peanut production area in Shandong Province, and Penglai County and other counties, proposed that the planned yield per mu of peanuts is 500 jin, and it is necessary to strengthen field management "with measures to strive to achieve 700 jin." In order to realize the "peanut thousand-jin cooperative," the Tuanjie Agricultural Cooperative in Penglai County has recently spent a lot of effort in peanut field management. The peanuts are growing very vigorously, and there is no shortage of seedlings. The experience of veteran farmers in Laiyang Prefecture is: one grass in a peanut hill will at least affect the maturity of one fruit. The Laiyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to the entire region to "thoroughly remove weeds." Even if weeding cannot be done after the peanuts have flowered and the ridges have been sealed, attention should still be paid to pulling out the weeds. Puyang County, Henan Province, has cultivated and weeded the peanut fields throughout the county three to four times, ensuring that there are no weeds in the fields. By the beginning of July, more than half of the peanuts had been topdressed. The peanuts are flowering and fruiting. The most outstanding are the ten mu of peanut fields planted by staff in Puyang County. In early July, each peanut plant had about forty fruits. The planned yield per mu of this experimental field is 5,000 jin. The masses said after seeing it: "There is great hope!" These are all new developments in this year's oil crop field management. All areas where autumn oil crops are growing unevenly or poorly should catch up quickly and truly grasp field management. Some people develop a negative mentality when the crops reach the later stages of growth: if they have relaxed in the past, it is too late to catch up now, so they might as well let them grow as they please! Wrong! The current season is indeed not early, but there is still much that can be done in field management. If you put in one point of effort now, you will get one point of harvest in the autumn. In this year's wheat production, farmers in many places put forward an active and enterprising slogan: "Field management will not stop until the wheat is harvested!" This spirit should also be learned in autumn oil crop production. Let us seize the season, make urgent efforts, and fight another great victory in oil production, so that this year's oil production leaps forward together with grain and cotton!

### 油料生产应该有一个跃进

    油料生产应该有一个跃进
    党的“八大”第二次会议号召全国要大力发展油料生产，把油料提高到粮食、棉花一样重要的地位。这个决定正确地反映了日益增长着的客观需要。在社会主义建设大跃进中，工业生产需要更多的植物油做原材料，人民日常生活需要更多的食油，同时油料大量增产以后，农民可以得到更多的油饼做饲料和肥料，国家也可以适当增加油料的出口。解放后这些年来，我国植物油料在不断地增产，但是增产的速度比粮食、棉花慢得多。在粮食、棉花生产正在大跃进的今天，不应该让油料生产继续落后下去了。让粮棉油生产一起跃进，——这是当前农业生产上的光荣任务。
    今年上半年，经过广大农民的努力，油料生产有了一个良好的开端，就是油菜普遍丰收了。全国夏收菜籽总产量预计可比去年增加60％左右。这是一个跃进。但是，单是油菜产量的跃进，并不等于全部油料产量的跃进。因为全国油菜种植面积只占油料作物总面积（不包括大豆）的30％。而秋季油料生产比重却比油菜大得多，如花生的产量历来占全国油料总产量（不包括大豆）的60％以上。所以，全年油料生产能不能实现大跃进，就看花生、大豆、芝麻、胡麻、蓖麻、向日葵等秋季油料作物和木本油料作物的收成如何了。因此，目前在油料生产方面还需要抓紧季节，大干苦干一番，争取秋季油料作物大丰收。
    有些人对于可以促进油料生产跃进的有利条件认识不足，他们夸大了油料生产同粮食、棉花生产之间的矛盾，以为抓了粮食、棉花，就不能再抓油料，因此在油料生产方面没有积极地多方面地采取保证油料跃进的有效措施，这就有使油料生产跃进指标落空的危险。那末，目前油料生产到底能不能和粮食、棉花生产一起跃进呢？答复是肯定的。第一、在总路线的鼓舞下，全国农民对于全面加速发展农业生产的干劲越来越大。在全国农业发展纲要的第二次的修正草案中，又为花生、油菜、大豆规定了积极的单位面积产量指标，这对于全国农民加速发展油料生产更是一个直接的鼓励。第二、国家经济部门已经采取了一系列的促进油料生产的措施，如国家对各省、自治区、直辖市实行食油差额调拨管理办法，对于调入区要求今后在一年至三年内达到油料自给；规定了油料和油饼的合理比价，改变了油饼价格高于油料的不合理现象；允许农业社经营土榨油坊，使农民能及时得到油饼使用等等。所有这些，也都有力地鼓励了广大农民发展油料生产的积极性。第三、由于各级党政组织对于油料生产领导的加强，由于广大农民在油料生产上的努力，不但今年上半年取得了油菜空前大丰收，而且从秋季油料作物的播种工作来看，今年的播种质量比往年好，很多地区推广了密植技术；施肥量也比往年多。这些都为秋季油料增产打下了良好的基础。第四、许多事实证明，油料的增产潜力很大，正等待大家去大力挖掘。今年上半年由于各地积极抓油菜增产措施，便出现了很多油菜大面积丰产的事例。如果下半年大力抓秋季油料作物的增产措施，普遍推广先进经验，秋季油料作物不但一定会大幅度地增产，而且也会出现许多高额丰产典型经验。
    从上面的说明中可以看出，加速发展油料生产的条件是十分有利的，只要根据全面迅速发展农业生产的精神来加强领导，就可以保证油料生产跟粮食、棉花生产一起齐头并肩跃进。湖北省红安县去年根据本县的具体条件，实行了“以粮、油生产为主”的全面发展生产的方针，在干旱的自然条件下，获得粮油双丰收，花生亩产量高达六百多斤，相当于全国花生平均亩产量的四倍，创造了我国前所未有的高产纪录。红安县粮油全面跃进的经验正在不少地区推广。河南省濮阳县今年在全面发展粮食、棉花、花生生产上作了巨大的努力，成绩突出。这个县广大农民的口号是：“粮食乘卫星，棉花驾火箭，花生增产赛闪电”！濮阳县今年种了十六万八千多亩花生。从春天开始，县领导机关就发动全县农民就花生生产跃进的问题展开大辩论，批判保守思想，挖掘增产潜力，学习先进经验，并且在生产中采取了深耕、平整土地、施足底肥、分期追肥、普及良种、适期播种、合理密植等一系列的措施。县委并成立了花生生产办公室，这个办公室搬到花生生产重点社——红霞农业社办公，就地指挥花生生产。现在全县花生生长得非常好，据农业部工作人员的了解，濮阳县今年实现“花生千斤县”大有希望。濮阳县领导机关和全县农民在发展油料生产上的干劲，值得各地学习。
    从生产季节上看，目前秋季油料作物正在或者即将开花结实，当前最紧要的事情，就是彻底把花生、大豆等作物的田间管理做好。这里包括适时中耕培土、追肥、抗旱防涝、防治病虫害等等。山东省花生集中产区莱阳专区蓬莱等县提出，花生计划亩产五百斤，要以“争取实现七百斤的措施”，加强田间管理。蓬莱县团结农业社为了实现“花生千斤社”，最近时期在花生田间管理上花了很大的功夫，花生长得十分旺盛，不缺一棵苗。莱阳专区老农的经验是：一墩花生有一棵草，至少要影响一个果子的成熟。中共莱阳地委向全区提出了“除草务净”的号召，在花生开花封垅以后不能锄草了，也要注意拔草。河南省濮阳县全县花生田已中耕除草三至四遍，做到田间无杂草，到7月上旬，已有一半以上的花生都已施了追肥。花生正在开花结果。最出色的是濮阳县工作人员种的十亩花生田，7月上旬每株花生已结果四十个上下。这块试验田计划亩产五千斤，群众看了说：“很有希望！”这些都是今年油料作物田间管理上的新进展。所有秋季油料作物生长不齐或生长不好的地区，都应当急起直追，把田间管理真正抓起来。有些人一到了庄稼生长的后期就产生了一种消极思想：过去放松了，现在抓也迟了，索性任它随便生长去吧！不对！目前季节的确是不早了，但是在田间管理上还大有可为，现在下一分功夫，秋后还会有一分收获。在今年的小麦生产中，好些地方农民提出了一个积极进取的口号：“麦子不收到手，田间管理就不停！”在秋季油料作物生产上也应当学习这种精神。让我们抓紧季节，紧急努力，在油料生产上再打一个大胜仗，使今年油料生产跟粮食、棉花一起跃进！
