    Chongde County in Zhejiang Province is a famous breeding ground for Lake Sheep. Sheep farming occupies a significant proportion of rural sideline production in Chongde County. Currently, the county has 149,273 sheep (including 1,254 goats), averaging three sheep per household, a 60% increase compared to before the autumn harvest last year. Among the county's seventeen townships, four have already become "Ten-Thousand Sheep Townships". Chongde County plans to have another major development after this autumn harvest, reaching 250,000 sheep by the end of the year, averaging five sheep per household, basically achieving "one sheep per mu of land."

    The large-scale development of Lake Sheep in this county has not only vigorously promoted the great leap forward in agricultural production, but also supported national industrial construction and increased farmers' income. Last year, the county supplied the state with over 80,000 small Lake Sheep skins, over 20,000 sheepskins, over 6,000 lamb skins, and nearly 2,000 dan of wool. These are all valuable industrial raw materials and export goods, increasing a considerable amount of foreign exchange for the country.

    Raising sheep has low costs, high returns, easy management, and rapid development. These are direct benefits to farmers. Buying a small ewe costs only eight to ten yuan, and it can produce two lambs in the second half of the year (some have four or five in one litter). In spring and autumn, each sheep can produce two or three jin of wool, plus fertilizer, generating a total annual income of 30 to 35 yuan.

    Another benefit of increasing Lake Sheep farming is the availability of large amounts of fertilizer. Sheep manure has always been one of the main sources of fertilizer for farm families in Chongde County. Sheep manure has a strong and lasting fertilizing effect and can loosen the soil, which is very popular among the masses. Last year, the county produced more than 2 million dan of sheep manure, averaging about ten dan per mu of land.

    四个“万羊乡”的县——崇德
    浙江省崇德县是有名的湖羊产地。养羊在崇德县农村副业生产中占很大比重。现在全县有羊十四万九千二百七十三头（其中山羊一千二百五十四头），平均每户三头，比去年秋收前增加六成。全县十七个乡，已有四个乡实现了“万羊乡”。崇德县计划在今年秋后再来一次大发展，年终达到二十五万头，平均每户五头，基本上达到“每亩田一头羊”。
    这个县湖羊的大发展，不仅有力地促进了农业生产大跃进，而且支援了国家工业建设和增加了农民收入。去年全县供给国家八万多张小湖羊皮、二万多张绵羊皮、六千多张袍羔皮和近二千担羊毛。这些都是贵重的工业原料和出口物资，为国家增加了相当数量的外汇。
    养羊成本轻，收益大，管理容易，发展快，这是对农民的直接好处。买进一头小母羊，成本只要八元到十元，当年下半年就能产二只羔羊（多的一胎有四、五只）。春秋二季每头可剪羊毛二、三斤，加上肥料，每年共可收入三十至三十五元。
    增养湖羊的另一好处是可以得到大量的肥料。羊肥向来是崇德县农家的主要肥源之一。羊肥肥效大、肥性长，能松土，群众很欢迎。去年全县共产羊肥二百多万担，平均每亩田达十担左右。
