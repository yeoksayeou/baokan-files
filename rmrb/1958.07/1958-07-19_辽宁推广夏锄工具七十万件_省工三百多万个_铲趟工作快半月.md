Xinhua News Agency report:  Liaoning Province has promoted more than fifty kinds of improved summer weeding agricultural implements in rural areas, totaling 783,000 pieces. According to calculations, this can save more than 3.13 million labor days and 1.21 million animal labor days during summer weeding production.

These improved agricultural implements include various weeding hoes, shovel tillers, sprayers, fertilizer application vehicles, etc. Their common characteristics are that they are small, diverse, simple, lightweight, easy to manufacture, easy to operate, and highly efficient.

This year, the progress of summer weeding production in rural Liaoning is generally half a month to twenty days faster than in previous years.  The promotion and use of improved agricultural implements has played a significant role in this. In Jianchang, Lingyuan, Yixian, Fuxin, Gaiping, Kaiyuan, and other ten counties, after basically achieving the improvement of agricultural implements in this year's summer weeding production, the number of shovel and tillage operations has generally increased by one to two times compared with last year. Kaiyuan County, which has historically had a shortage of labor, has not only overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor in summer weeding production this year due to the promotion of more than 14,000 highly efficient summer weeding agricultural implements, but has also been able to allocate more than 10,000 laborers to carry out year-round water conservancy infrastructure construction.

    辽宁推广夏锄工具七十万件
    省工三百多万个　铲趟工作快半月
    据新华社讯　辽宁省各地农村已经推广各种夏锄改良农具五十多种，共七十八万三千多件。据计算，可以在夏锄生产中节省三百一十三万多个劳动日和一百二十一万个畜工。
    这些改良农具有各种耘锄、铲趟机、喷雾器、追肥车等，它们的共同特点是小型多样，简单轻便，容易制造，易于操纵，使用效率高。
    今年辽宁农村的夏锄生产进度普遍比往年快半个月到二十天，改良农具的推广和使用在这当中起了很大的作用。建昌、凌源、义县、阜新、盖平、开原等十个县，今年夏锄生产中基本上实现农具改良化以后，铲趟普遍比去年增加一遍到两遍。劳动力历来不足的开原县，今年由于推广了一万四千多件工效很高的夏锄农具，不仅克服了夏锄生产劳力不足的困难，而且还能抽出一万多个劳动力进行常年水利基本建设。
