    The Minjiang River Bridge in Yibin City, Sichuan Province, is the largest railway bridge on the Neijiang-Kunming Railway, with a length of 351 meters. This bridge began beam assembly on June 11th, and was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of October. Under the brilliant light of the General Line, the bridge builders are exerting their utmost efforts, striving to complete the entire project by mid-September ahead of schedule. This is a scene of the bridge construction site using the advanced Soviet cantilever beam erection method to erect steel beams.
