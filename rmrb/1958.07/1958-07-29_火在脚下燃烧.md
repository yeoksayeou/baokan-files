    Fire Burning Beneath Their Feet
    Liu Feng
    A raging fire is beginning to burn beneath the feet of the American and British imperialists. Righteous American people oppose the aggressive actions of their own government and Britain in interfering in the Arab Middle East; the British "Stop the War" movement committee has been established in the House of Commons, demanding the complete withdrawal of British troops from Jordan, and the British Independent Party has also issued a statement condemning the invasion of Jordan by British troops and the invasion of Lebanon by American troops; Latin American countries such as Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay have launched movements against the American and British aggression in the Middle East, and the scale is expanding day by day. All this shows how unpopular the American and British invasion is, even in their own countries and within their own spheres of influence, and that it has met with widespread opposition. This fully demonstrates that the actions of the aggressors cannot represent the will of the people of their countries.
    Evil acts of aggression that cannot gain the support of the people have never lasted long and are bound to fail. The oil of the Middle East will not only burn the American and British imperialist invading forces to death, but the flames of opposition from their own people are also burning from beneath their feet. Victory will surely belong to the people of all countries who oppose aggression and defend peace, including the broad masses of the people in Britain, the United States, and Latin America.
    The fire is burning beneath the feet of the American and British imperialists, and they are besieged on all sides, unable to gain a firm foothold no matter what. To use a Chinese proverb, it would be "He who plays with fire gets burned!"

    火在脚下燃烧
    刘丰
    熊熊的烈火正开始在美英帝国主义者的脚下燃烧起来。正直的美国人民反对他们本国政府和英国干涉阿拉伯中东的侵略行为；英国“制止战争”运动委员会已经下院成立，要求英军全部撤出约旦，英国独立党也发表声明，谴责英国军队侵略约旦和美国军队侵略黎巴嫩；拉丁美洲的阿根廷、智利、乌拉圭等国已经开展了反对美英侵略中东的运动，并且规模一天比一天广泛。这一切说明了美英这次的罪恶的侵略行为，是多末不得人心，即使在它们的本国，即使在它们自己的势力范围内，也是受到了普遍的反对，这充分说明了侵略者的行为是完全不能代表它们国家人民的意志的。
    不能得到人民支持的罪恶的侵略行为，从来就是不能支持长久的，也是必然要失败的。中东的石油不仅仅会把美英帝国主义侵略军活活烧死，它们本国的人民的反对的火焰也从脚下燃烧起来。胜利必然是属于反对侵略、维护和平的各国人民，包括英国和美国以及拉丁美洲的广大的人民。
    火在美英帝国主义的脚下燃烧，它们是腹背受敌，无论如何也是不能站得稳脚跟的。如果用一句中国俗语来说的话，那就是“玩火者必自焚”吧！
