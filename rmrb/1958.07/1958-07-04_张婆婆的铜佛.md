    Grandma Zhang's Bronze Buddha
    Grandma Zhang Yinhua had a bronze Buddha passed down from her ancestors. She cherished it very much and regarded it as a treasure.
    This time, the county was vigorously developing local industries. The residents' committee held a meeting and also organized the masses to visit the town's fish meal factory, shipyard, and machinery repair factory. The old lady also went. After returning from the visit, she held a family meeting at her home. Her sons and grandsons all made investment plans. Grandma Zhang also took out her bronze Buddha and said, "Let this be my investment!" Zhong Fang
