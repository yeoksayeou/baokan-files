    The Crystallization of Revolutionary Zeal and Technological Innovation
    Anguo County's Wheat Yield Reaches 440 Jin Per Mu
    (Our Correspondent Wen Ying reports) The 183,000 mu of wheat in Anguo County, Hebei Province, achieved an average yield of 440 jin per mu, a leap of 2.7 times compared to last year's unit area yield. Among them, more than 5,000 mu of high-yield fields exceeded 1,000 jin.

    The combination of an indomitable revolutionary spirit and widespread mass-based technological revolution is the most fundamental condition and the most important experience for Anguo County to realize its wheat leap forward plan. From wheat sowing to harvesting, they launched ten management high tides. They developed water conservancy and vigorously accumulated fertilizer. Under the severe drought, the wheat had water when it needed water and fertilizer when it needed fertilizer during the wheat growth process. Missing seedlings were transplanted and replenished, and weak seedlings were given extra water and fertilizer. This ensured that the vast majority of wheat fields received 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, 6 or 7 top dressings, and 8 or 9 irrigations. Tens of thousands of mu of Class III wheat were quickly transformed into Class I wheat.

    In order to overcome the drought and ensure water for wheat and irrigation for all farmland, Anguo County dug 466 machine wells in one winter and spring. Together with the original machine wells, the county reached a total of 784 wells. At the same time, 25 socialist large wells were dug, and 807 boiler-powered machines were purchased, totaling more than 6,900 horsepower, making all irrigation work mechanized. At the same time, all wheat fields adopted superior seeds, and communes carried out experimental fields, popularized the experience of wheat watering and topdressing, as well as wheat management for various different soil types, making wheat management scientific. This series of technical measures ensured that the wheat had many tillers, long ears, full grains, and did not lodge or lodged less, thus achieving universal bumper harvests.

    革命干劲和技术革新的结晶
    安国县小麦亩产440斤
    本报讯　记者文英报道：河北省安国县十八万三千多亩小麦，平均亩产四百四十斤。比去年的单位面积产量跃进了二点七倍。其中，千斤以上的高额丰产田有五千余亩。
    勇往直前的十足的革命干劲和广泛的群众性的技术革命相结合，是安国县实现小麦跃进计划的最根本的条件和最重要的经验。从小麦播种到收割，他们搞了十次管理高潮。开水利，闹积肥，在严重的干旱袭击下，小麦要水有水，在小麦生长过程中需肥有肥，缺苗地移栽补齐，弱苗偏水偏肥。保证了绝大多数麦田达到亩施底肥二万斤，追肥六、七次，灌水八、九回，数万亩三类麦很快变成了一类麦。
    为战胜干旱，保证小麦用水和全部农田的灌溉，安国县在一个冬春凿了四百六十六眼机井，连同原有机井全县达到了七百八十四眼，同时挖了二十五个社会主义大井，购置了八百零七台锅驼机，总计六千九百多马力，使全部灌溉工作机械化。同时，麦田全部采用优种，社社搞了试验田，推广小麦浇水和追肥以及各种不同土质的小麦管理的经验，使小麦管理科学化。这一系列的技术措施，保证了小麦分蘖多，穗子长，籽粒满，不倒伏和少倒伏，从而普遍丰收。
