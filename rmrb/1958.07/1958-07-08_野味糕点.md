    Wild Game Pastries
    Various regions of Yunnan are using potatoes and wild starch plants to produce more than a thousand kinds of pastries, sweets, and fragrant wines. In areas such as the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture and the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, local subtropical wild plants such as canna, kudzu root, wild yam, bitter cardamine, and lalang grass roots are being used to make cream biscuits, filled cakes, yellow-skinned bread, mung bean cakes, and transparent fruit candies. Various regions have also successively used cactus and thirty-six other kinds of wild plants to brew fragrant wines. These foods and wines taste as good as those made from grains, and they are sold at low prices and are very popular in the market.

    野味糕点
    云南各地利用薯类和野生淀粉植物，制作出一千多种糕饼、糖果和香酒。德宏傣族景颇族自治州、红河哈尼族彝族自治州等地区，利用当地出产的芭蕉芋、葛根、野山药、苦卡拉、芨芨根等亚热带野生植物，做出了奶油饼干、夹心蛋糕、黄皮面包、绿豆糕和透明的水果糖。各地还陆续用仙人掌等三十六种野生植物酿成香酒。这些食品和酒，味道和粮食做的一样好，而且售价低廉，在市场上很受欢迎。
