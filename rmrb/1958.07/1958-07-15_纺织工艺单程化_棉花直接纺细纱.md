    Single-Process Textile Technology
    Cotton Directly Spun into Fine Yarn
    The "Combined Scutcher, Carding, Drawing, Roving, and Spinning Machine" was successfully tested on July 10th at the Qingfeng Textile Factory in Wuxi. This innovation allows cotton to be directly spun into fine yarn, reducing the spinning process from five steps to one, and shortening the time it takes to spin cotton into fine yarn from twenty-four hours to five minutes. The quality of the spun yarn has been inspected and found to be of first-class quality. This thoroughly realizes the single-process textile technology and opens up broad prospects for achieving high-speed and automation. On July 4th, the factory's employees successfully used a multi-roller cotton shredder to replace the complex scutching process. Subsequently, on July 10th, they connected the multi-roller cotton shredder and the carding machine through a carding tube and a cotton storage box, and installed four pairs of "rollers" in front of the "doffer" of the carding machine. In this way, cotton combined five processes into one, fifteen machines into two, and directly spun fine yarn from cotton. Because four processes are reduced, the consumption of raw materials, materials, and supplies can be greatly reduced, and a large amount of labor can be saved (estimated to be at least 40%). In addition, after reducing thirteen kinds of mechanical equipment, factory area and electricity can also be greatly saved. The heavy labor in the original processes, such as pushing flower laps and carrying roving, can also be completely eliminated.

    纺织工艺单程化
    棉花直接纺细纱
    “清花、梳棉、并条、粗纱、细纱联合机”7月10日在无锡市庆丰纺织厂试验成功。这一创造，可以使棉花直接纺成细纱，使纺纱工序从五道并成一道，使棉花纺成细纱的时间从二十四小时缩短到五分钟，纺出的细纱经过检验质量达到上等一级。这就彻底实现了纺织工艺的单程化，并为实现高速化自动化开辟了广阔的道路。7月4日，这个厂的职工试验用多滚筒碎棉机代替复杂的清花工序成功；接着，又在7月10日通过梳棉管和储棉箱，把多滚筒碎棉机和梳棉机连结在一起，同时在梳棉机的“道夫”前面装置了四对“罗拉”。这样，棉花就把五道工序并成了一道，十五种机器并成了两种，直接用棉花纺出了细纱。由于减少了四道工序，可以大大减少原料、材料、物料的消耗、节省大量劳动力（估计至少可以节省40％）。此外，减少了十三种机械设备以后，又可以大大节省厂房面积和电力。原来各道工序上的笨重劳动，如推花卷、掮粗纱等也可以全部取消。
