    (By our correspondent in Heilongjiang) After the elimination of illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in Heilongjiang Province, the entire social landscape has undergone new changes. Currently, the number of workers and peasants participating in the study of political theory and philosophy in all cities and towns, as well as remote rural areas, has rapidly increased from one million to three million.
    Tens of thousands of workers and peasants who have just shed their illiteracy caps have broken the mysterious view of studying theory and philosophy. In Harbin alone, workers have established 3,000 philosophy study groups, with 70,000 workers participating in the study. Guan Wenchang, the Party Branch Secretary of the Tuanshanzi Collective Farm in Ning'an County, one of the first to become literate, has completed the study of the three volumes of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. These workers and peasants with rich production knowledge and class struggle knowledge have achieved good results after studying theory. At the Mudanjiang Cement Plant, four workers have already reported to the workers at the conference, criticizing the revisionist ideas of the Yugoslav communists, which was welcomed by the masses.
    Among the workers and peasants who have eliminated illiteracy, writers and artists are emerging in large numbers. They use simple writing to profoundly describe the pace of the times. Fan Lianbao, a young worker at the Hualin Rubber Factory in Mudanjiang, wrote more than 2,000 works of various genres after leaving illiteracy. One of them, called "Three Years of Wishes Realized," describes the process of factory workers creating automatic grinding machines. This article was selected as a textbook for the factory night school. The workers said that studying this article improved their thinking, learned technology, and learned culture. A climax of poetry creation has appeared in the vast urban and rural areas. Abao Agricultural Cooperative in Ning'an County has become a "poetic" village. Old people, children, and women can all write poetry. They recite poems when they meet and write poems when they cook. Young men and women also use poetry to express love. At the beginning of summer hoeing this year, Lin Deliang, the deputy director, and Lu Yongliang and Yan Shiliang, the production team leaders, of the cooperative were somewhat complacent because they had done a good job in spring plowing. Yan Tingzhang, a farmer in this cooperative who had just gotten rid of illiteracy, wrote a poem to criticize them: "They can talk well at the Leap Forward meeting, but sleep at the head of the field. This kind of cadre is really not self-conscious." These cadres immediately accepted the criticism, overcame their complacency, and their work style greatly changed. Yan Tingzhang then wrote a poem to praise them: "Lin Deliang, Lu Yongliang, and also Yan Shiliang, are now working really beautifully, going to the fields before dawn, and working at night with the moon above. If you ask why they are doing so well, it is because the General Line shines brightly in their hearts."
    After many workers and peasants got rid of illiteracy, reading newspapers and periodicals has become an indispensable part of their daily life. Farmers reading newspapers can be seen everywhere in the fields. Farmers in Ning'an County subscribed to more than 50,000 copies of various newspapers and periodicals in June this year. In Tailai County, 80% of young and middle-aged farmers subscribed to a newspaper. At the same time, clubs and libraries have been established in all townships and communes throughout the province, becoming places for them to gather in the evening and gain knowledge. In Zhaoyuan County, in just a few months, more than 70 communes have used semiconductor mother-child radios to set up commune-level broadcasting stations. This cultural upsurge has further promoted the production upsurge. Various schools serving production have been established in various places. Zhaoyuan County has already established ten specialized schools. These schools are based on the needs of production. Whatever needs to be done, that is the kind of school that is established. Among them are the water conservancy school for realizing water conservancy in the county this year and next year, the kiln industry school established to convert all rural houses into brick and tile houses within three years, the civil engineering and construction school established to build 5,600 factory buildings in the county, and the Women's Red and Expert University to facilitate women's participation in production. These schools are almost all run by workers and peasants who have gotten rid of illiteracy, and they teach themselves. The most outstanding one is the animal husbandry school. The principal is a farmer who has just graduated from a literacy school, and 30% of the students are graduates of literacy schools and experienced animal husbandry workers. This kind of vivid and touching example appears everywhere in the province.

### 黑龙江文化浪潮越来越高  千百万工农学理论、学哲学、搞创作、读书报

    黑龙江文化浪潮越来越高
    千百万工农学理论、学哲学、搞创作、读书报
    本报讯　本报驻黑龙江记者报道：黑龙江省扫除了青壮年文盲后，整个社会面貌发生了新的变化。目前全省所有城镇以至偏远的农村参加学习政治理论、学习哲学的工人农民已经由一百万人很快地发展到三百万人。
    成千上万刚摘掉文盲帽子的工人和农民，打破了学习理论、学习哲学的神秘观点，仅哈尔滨的工人就成立了三千个哲学学习小组，参加学习的工人已达七万人。宁安县第一批脱盲的团山子集体农庄的党支部书记关文昌，已学完了毛泽东选集三卷。这些有着丰富生产知识、阶级斗争知识的工人农民，学习理论后收到很好的效果。牡丹江水泥厂已经有四个工人在大会上向工人作报告，批判南共的修正主义思想，受到广大群众欢迎。
    在扫除了文盲的工农群众中，作家和艺术家正在大批出现，他们以朴素的笔法，深刻地描写出时代的脚步。牡丹江桦林橡胶厂青年工人范连保在脱离文盲状态以后，写了二千多篇各种体裁的作品。其中一篇叫做“三年的心愿实现了”，描写工厂工人创造自动磨牙机的经过。这篇文章被选入工厂夜校做教材，工人们说，学习这篇文章提高了思想，学习了技术，又学了文化。广大城乡已经出现诗歌创作的高潮。宁安县的阿堡农业社已经成为“诗歌化”的农村，老年人、小孩、妇女都会作诗，他们开会时吟诗，煮饭时作诗。青年男女还用诗歌来表达爱情。今年夏锄开始时，这个社因为春耕生产搞得好，副主任林德亮和生产队长卢永亮、颜世亮有些自满情绪。这个社刚摆脱文盲状态的农民颜廷章就作诗来批评他们：“跃进会上能说会道，到田里领头睡觉，这种干部真不自觉。”这些干部马上就接受批评，克服了自满情绪，作风有了很大转变。颜廷章又写了一首诗表扬他们：“林德亮、卢永亮，另外还有个颜世亮，如今干起活来真漂亮，早晨下地天不亮，晚上干活月顶亮。要问为啥干得好，总路线照得他们心头亮。”
    许多工农群众脱离文盲状态后，阅读书报已成为他们日常生活不可缺少的事情。在田间地头到处可以看到读报的农民，宁安县农民今年6月份就订阅了各种报刊五万多份，泰来县80％的青壮年农民，每人都订了一份报纸，同时，在全省已经乡乡社社建立了俱乐部和图书室，成为他们晚间集会和长知识的地方。肇源县在短短几个月内，已有七十多个社利用半导体母子收音机，办起了社内广播站。这种文化高潮，又进一步推动了生产高潮。各地兴办了各种为生产服务的学校，肇源县已经办起了十处专业学校，这些学校都是根据生产发展的需要，做什么，就办什么学校。其中有为今年和明年全县实现水利化的水利学校，为在三年内农村全部改成砖瓦房而成立的窑业学校，为全县修建五千六百个工厂厂房而成立的土木建筑学校，和为便利妇女参加生产的妇女红专大学。这些学校差不多都是脱离文盲状态的工人农民自办的，而且是自己教自己。其中最突出的是畜牧学校，校长是一个刚从扫盲学校毕业的农民，学员30％是扫盲学校的毕业生和有经验的畜牧员。这种生动感人的事例在全省到处出现。
