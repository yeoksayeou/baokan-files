    Semi-Monthly Agricultural Situation
    “Minor Heat” (July 7) – “Major Heat” (July 23)
    During this period, most areas continued to be threatened by drought, while a few areas experienced floods or waterlogging. Provinces and regions such as Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Guizhou all experienced varying degrees of drought, with more severe drought conditions in Anhui, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces.

    All drought-stricken areas have made drought resistance and ensuring harvests the main task during this period. These areas have constructed a large number of water conservancy projects and added a large number of water-lifting tools in the fight against drought. In the Huainan eight counties of Anhui's Bengbu Special District, and the three special districts of Lu'an, Wuhu, and Anqing, a total of 2.66 million wells and springs were dug by July 16. By July 17, over 710,000 new-style waterwheels of various types had been promoted throughout Anhui province.

    Summer is the season when weeds and shrubs grow vigorously. Many areas continued to carry out the work of fermenting green manure during this stage. Many northern provinces have made pressing green manure an important part of summer production. Some areas with tight schedules for summer hoeing have put forward the slogan: "Summer hoeing and green manure pressing are not delayed." Making fertilizer on the spot on mountains, field edges, and headlands to reduce round-trip transportation is a feature of summer fertilizer accumulation in many areas this year. In Jinzhou Special District, Liaoning, twelve counties including Kazuo, Fuxin, Beizhen, and Jinxi, dug more than 255,400 fertilizer pits on mountains and headlands, achieving: taking materials locally, fermenting locally, and using locally.
                                    ★
    These two weeks are the busiest time for harvesting and transplanting early rice in early rice producing areas. Before "Major Heat", the early rice in Sichuan, Hunan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces had been harvested more than half in some areas, and about one-third in others. The yield per unit area of ​​most of the early rice in these provinces is more than double that of last year. Many areas combined the harvesting of early rice to summarize the experience of high-yield early rice and select and retain early rice seeds. While rushing to harvest early rice, they are also rushing to transplant late rice.
                                      ★
    The harvesting of spring wheat has already begun before "Major Heat". Some areas in the Northwest with earlier seasons are nearing completion. The full harvesting of spring wheat in Heilongjiang and other places will be in early August. According to various estimates, this year's spring wheat can generally increase production by about 60% compared to last year.

    In order to achieve careful and timely harvesting and threshing, many production units promoted improved harvesting tools before the opening of the harvest. Heilongjiang Province promoted a large sickle in state-owned farms, which is twice as efficient as a small sickle. The Mishan Reclamation Bureau successfully reformed a chain-wheel automatic combine harvester that can harvest normally in rainy and muddy conditions.
                                    ★
    In mid- and late-July, cotton in most areas entered the reproductive stage of abundant flowering and boll formation. Many areas have launched campaigns to strengthen the mid-season bolls and protect the late-season bolls. After discovering the potential for increased production in some areas where cotton is growing well, they promptly put forward new requirements for increased production and used new targets for increased production to promote late-stage field management. This is a new phenomenon in cotton production this year.

    半月农情
    “小暑”（7月7日）——“大暑”（7月23日）
    大部地区在这个阶段继续受到干旱威胁，少数地区发生水害或雨涝。吉林、辽宁、黑龙江、山东、安徽、江苏、广西、江西、贵州等省区，都有轻重不同的干旱，安徽、吉林、辽宁等省旱象较重。
    各干旱地区都把抗旱保收列为这一时期的主要任务。这些地区在抗旱中兴修了大量的水利工程，添置了大批提水工具。安徽蚌埠专区的淮南八县，六安、芜湖、安庆三个专区，到7月16日共打井、下泉二百六十六万眼。到7月17日，安徽全省推广各种新式水车七十一万多部。
                                      ★
    夏季是杂草、灌木生长茂盛季节，许多地区在这个阶段继续开展沤制绿肥工作。北方许多省都把压绿肥列为夏季生产的一个重要内容。一些夏锄紧张的地区，提出了：“夏锄、压肥两不误”口号。在山上、田边、地头就地沤制，以减少往返运输，是今年许多地区夏季积肥的一个特点。辽宁锦州专区的喀左、阜新、北镇、锦西等十二个县，就在山上、地头挖了二十五万五千四百多个积肥坑，作到了：就地取材、就地沤制、就地使用。
                                    ★
    这半个月正是早稻产区抢收抢插的大忙时期。在“大暑”以前，四川、湖南、福建、浙江、安徽等省的早稻，有些已收获一半以上，有些已收了三分之一左右。这些省的绝大部分早稻的单位产量比去年高出一倍以上。不少地区结合收获早稻，总结了早稻丰产经验和选留了早稻种子。在抢收早稻的同时，紧张地抢插晚稻。
                                      ★
    春小麦的收割已在“大暑”前开始。西北一些季节较早地区，已经接近收完。黑龙江等地的春麦，全面收割要在8月上旬。据各方面估计，今年春麦一般可比去年增产60％左右。
    为了作到收打精细及时，不少生产单位在开镰以前推广了改良的收割工具。黑龙江省在国营农场范围推广一种大镰刀，比小镰刀效率高一倍。密山农垦局改革成功一种能在雨大泥泞情况下正常收割的链轮式自动联合收割机。
                                    ★
    7月中、下旬，大部地区的棉花进入大量开花结桃的生育阶段。不少地区都开展了壮伏桃、保秋桃运动。有些棉花生长良好地区，在发现这项生产的增产潜力以后，及时提出新的增产要求，用新的增产指标来推动后期田间管理。这是今年棉花生产中一种新气象。
