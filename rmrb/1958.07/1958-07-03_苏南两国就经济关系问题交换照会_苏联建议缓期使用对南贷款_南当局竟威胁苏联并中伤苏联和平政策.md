Xinhua News Agency, July 1st dispatch from Moscow: The newspapers here published on June 30th the notes recently exchanged between the Soviet and Yugoslav governments on certain issues concerning economic relations between the two countries. These documents are being published because of the Yugoslav newspapers' incorrect and biased explanation of Soviet-Yugoslav relations.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry's note of May 27 to the Yugoslav Embassy in the Soviet Union stated that the Soviet government found it necessary to suggest a postponement of the use of loans provided to Yugoslavia under the economic agreements of January and August 1956. This necessity arose because the Soviet Union had recently adopted a resolution to accelerate the development of the chemical industry, especially the development of synthetic materials and their products, to meet the needs of the residents and the national economy, as the implementation of this resolution required the Soviet Union to make large new investments in the chemical industry in the near future. Therefore, the Soviet Union revised its original financial plan to ensure the most economically efficient use of financial resources.

The note pointed out that, due to this situation, the Soviet government suggested: with regard to the portion of the 1956 January agreement concerning the subsequent use of the loan, that the use of this loan be postponed to 1962-1969, and with regard to the August 1956 agreement, that the loan be postponed to 1963-1969.

The deadlines for providing equipment and completing the design work and other work stipulated in the agreement should also be adjusted to reflect the above-mentioned changes in the loan usage period.

However, if the Yugoslav government so wishes, the Soviet foreign trade organizations can provide equipment to Yugoslav organizations and complete design work and other work, but not by means of loans, but by means of payment through normal trade.

The note said that during the postponement of the start-up of the enterprises stipulated in the agreement, including fertilizer plants, if the Yugoslav side wishes, the Soviet side can provide Yugoslavia with a certain amount of mineral fertilizers and other industrial products based on mutual agreement through barter trade.

The Soviet government believes that the above-mentioned proposal is in line with the principles of economic cooperation between countries that are beneficial to both sides.

In its reply note of June 3, the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs rejected the Soviet government's proposal, stating that the Yugoslav government could not consider the reasons listed in the Soviet government's note. In the note, the Yugoslav government also threatened the Soviet government, stating that if the Soviet government insisted on its position, the Yugoslav government would reserve the right to demand compensation.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued another note on June 28 in response to the Yugoslav note of June 3. This note pointed out that the Yugoslav government had taken an attitude that could not but be surprising, even without expressing agreement to a substantive discussion of the Soviet note of May 27. The content and tone of the Yugoslav note of June 3, as well as the Yugoslav side's consistent attitude on this issue, and in particular the unfounded claim that the Soviet government had violated these agreements, all demonstrated an attempt to misrepresent the Soviet attitude towards Soviet-Yugoslav economic relations, and an attempt to raise doubts about the Soviet Union's fulfillment of its international treaty obligations.

The note said that, needless to say, the Soviet Union, by pursuing a policy aimed at consolidating peace and developing cooperation between countries, has consistently strictly fulfilled its international obligations. It is also well known that modifying individual clauses in an agreement after negotiations between the two parties does not go beyond the normal international treaty practices recognized by all countries, and that neither party can be deprived of the right to raise the issue of amending individual clauses in the agreement because of the agreement itself.

The note mentioned that the Soviet government also took into account the interests of the Yugoslav side when making the above-mentioned proposals. The note said that this can be seen from the following: While proposing to modify the loan usage period and correspondingly modify the deadlines for supplying equipment and completing the design work and other work stipulated in the agreement, the Soviet Union also expressed its willingness to provide Yugoslavia with the industrial products that these factories should produce during the postponement of the start-up of the factories by means of payment through normal trade. This of course refers to the supply of goods at mutually beneficial international prices. At the same time, the Soviet government had stated that if Yugoslavia considered it more appropriate, it would be willing to continue supplying equipment and completing the design work and other work stipulated in the agreement within the previously stipulated time frame, also on the basis of payment through normal trade. This situation alone is enough to prove the Soviet government's good faith attitude towards the issue.

At the same time, the Soviet government also took into account that the Yugoslav side had repeatedly stated that Soviet-Yugoslav relations should be built on the principle of mutual benefit. The Soviet side believes that these statements express the Yugoslav government's carefully considered attitude and its desire to build our two countries' economic ties on the above-mentioned principles. It can be seen that the issue is how to bring the terms of the Soviet-Yugoslav economic agreements closer to the principles that usually form the basis for signing mutually beneficial agreements between countries.

The Soviet note concluded by saying that the Soviet government's proposal to postpone the use of loans, to some extent, balanced the benefits obtained by both parties signing the agreement, rather than just benefiting the Yugoslav side, but the Soviet government did not propose to amend other conditions of the agreement, even though these conditions were also particularly favorable to Yugoslavia, and would not be adopted if the two sides were to proceed solely from purely mutually beneficial commercial relations. This also needs to be taken into account when discussing the Soviet proposal. Based on the above, the Soviet government believes that it would be correct for representatives of the two governments to hold a meeting in the near future to discuss the issues raised in the Soviet note of May 27 in a practical and realistic manner, and to reach an agreement on the Soviet government's proposal to amend the agreements of January 1 and August 1, 1956.

### 苏南两国就经济关系问题交换照会  苏联建议缓期使用对南贷款  南当局竟威胁苏联并中伤苏联和平政策

    苏南两国就经济关系问题交换照会
    苏联建议缓期使用对南贷款
    南当局竟威胁苏联并中伤苏联和平政策
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：这里的报纸6月30日刊载了苏联政府和南斯拉夫政府最近就两国间某些经济关系问题所交换的照会。发表这些文件是由于南斯拉夫报纸对苏南关系问题作了不正确的、偏颇的说明。
    苏联外交部5月27日给南斯拉夫驻苏联大使馆的照会表示，苏联政府有必要建议缓期使用根据1956年1月和8月的经济协定供给南斯拉夫的贷款。这个必要性之所以产生是由于不久以前苏联通过了加速发展化学工业、特别是发展合成物质及其制品以满足居民和国民经济需要的决议，因为实现这个决议要求苏联在最近期间对化学工业进行大量的新的投资。因此苏联修改了原来的财政计划，以保证经济上最有效地利用财政资源。
    照会指出，由于这种情况，苏联政府建议：在1956年1月协定中有关此后利用贷款的部分方面，确定把这笔贷款延期到1962年至1969年使用，在1956年8月的协定方面，确定把贷款延到1963年至1969年使用。
    提供装备和完成协定规定的设计工作以及其他工作的期限，也应该适应上述贷款使用期限的修改。
    但是，如果南斯拉夫政府希望，那么苏联对外贸易机构可以给南斯拉夫机构提供设备以及完成设计工作和其他工作，但是不用贷款的办法，而是用日常贸易支付的办法。
    照会说，在协议中所规定的企业、其中包括肥料企业延期开工期间，如果南斯拉夫方面希望，苏联方面可以换货的方式根据双方协议提供南斯拉夫一定数量矿物肥料和其他工业产品。
    苏联政府认为，上述建议符合有利于双方的国家之间的经济合作原则。
    南斯拉夫对外国务秘书处在6月3日的复照中，拒绝了苏联政府的建议，表示南斯拉夫政府不能考虑苏联政府照会中所列举的理由。南斯拉夫政府在照会中还威胁苏联政府，如果苏联政府坚持它的立场，南斯拉夫政府就要保留要求赔偿的权利。
    苏联外交部6月28日就南斯拉夫6月3日的照会又发出了一份照会。这份照会指出，南斯拉夫政府甚至没有表示同意对苏联5月27日照会的建议进行实质的讨论，便采取了不能不令人惊讶的态度。南斯拉夫6月3日的照会的内容和口吻以及南斯拉夫方面对这个问题的一贯态度，特别是认为苏联政府破坏了这些协定这种毫无根据的说法，都证明企图不正确地阐述苏联对苏南经济关系的态度，并且企图引起人们对苏联在履行国际条约义务方面的怀疑。
    照会说，毋庸赘言，苏联由于奉行旨在巩固和平和发展各国之间的合作的政策，因而是一贯严格履行自己的国际义务的。大家也还知道，经双方谈判后而修改协议中的个别条款，并不越出各国公认的正常的国际条约惯例，而且双方不能够因为协议本身而被剥夺提出修改协定中的个别条款的问题的权利。
    照会谈到苏联政府在提出上述建议时也考虑到了南斯拉夫方面的利益。照会说，这从下面一点可以看出：苏联一方面提出修改贷款使用期限，并相应修改供应设备以及完成协定所规定的设计工作和其他工作的期限，同时表示愿意在工厂延期开工期间以日常贸易支付方法向南斯拉夫提供这些工厂应当生产的工业品。这里指的当然是按照相互有利的国际价格供货。同时，苏联政府曾经表示，如果南斯拉夫认为更合适的话，它愿意也在日常贸易支付的基础上在先前规定的期限内继续供应设备以及完成协定所规定的设计工作和其他工作。只是这一情况就足以证明苏联政府方面对问题的善意态度。
    同时苏联政府还考虑到：南斯拉夫方面曾一再表示苏南关系应当建筑在互利的原则上。苏联方面认为，这些声明表达了南斯拉夫政府经过慎重考虑的态度和它要把我们两国的经济联系建筑在上述原则上的愿望。由此可见，问题在于如何使苏南两国的经济协定的条件接近作为国与国之间通常签定互惠协定的基础的原则。
    苏联的照会最后说，苏联政府提出延期使用贷款的建议，在某种程度上使签定协定的双方得到的好处得以平衡，而不只是南斯拉夫一方受惠，但是苏联政府没有建议修改协定的其他条件，尽管这些条件也是对南斯拉夫特别优惠，而且在双方只从纯粹的互惠的商业关系出发时是不采用的。在讨论苏联建议的时候也不能不考虑到这一点。基于上述情况，苏联政府认为，两国政府的代表们在最近期间举行会议来实事求是地讨论5月27日的苏联照会中所提出的问题、并就苏联政府提出的关于修改1956年1月1日和8月1日的协定的问题达成协议是正确的。
