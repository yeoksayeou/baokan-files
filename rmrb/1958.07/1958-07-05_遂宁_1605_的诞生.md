    The Birth of Suining "1605"
    Luo Yunjun
    A chicken flapped erratically, running around the room. It struggled for only seven minutes before collapsing. This was the result of injecting 0.2CC of Suining's trial-produced "1605" insecticide. This fact illustrates that "1605," which previously relied mainly on imports, can now be produced by us with simple equipment!

    Who are the experts and scientists who successfully trial-produced "1605"?

    No, they are ordinary people!

    They are Yu Kainan, a cadre from the Suining Special District Industrial and Transportation Bureau, Wang Sen, a teacher from Suining Middle School, Liu Bolu, a technician from the Qun Kang Dyeing Factory, and Tan, a pharmacist from the Suining Special District People's Hospital.

    In the book "Chemical World," a description of less than five hundred words and a simple chemical equation were all the information they had.

    According to the Hamilton method of making "1605," the synthetic raw materials for "1605" are: one is p-nitrophenol, and the other is diethyl thiophosphoryl chloride.

    The trial production work began. In the laboratory filled with test tubes and flasks, Wang Sen and pharmacist Tan began to produce p-nitrophenol—the first step in making "1605"—using sulfuric acid, copper nitrate, and carbolic acid. Without cooling equipment, the produced phenol would gel. What to do? With the help of the hospital's Party committee, they used ice for tissue therapy to create simple cooling equipment. P-nitrophenol was successfully produced, obtaining the first raw material for manufacturing "1605."

    The second step was to produce diethyl thiophosphoryl chloride. This is the main raw material for "1605" and also the most difficult task. In the absence of sufficient instruments and equipment, without a stirring instrument "mercury seal," they used glass tubes instead. If the boiling point could not be reached by distilling with an alcohol lamp, they adopted the method of directly increasing the heat... finally, they obtained the first raw material of diethyl thiophosphoryl chloride, diethyl thiophosphate.

    The final process of making diethyl thiophosphoryl chloride is to pass chlorine into diethyl thiophosphate.

    It was already late at night. Yu Kainan and Wang Sen seemed to be diagnosing a critically ill patient, performing the work of passing chlorine into diethyl thiophosphate with utmost caution and seriousness. When chlorination was completed and hydrolysis was performed, an unexpected event occurred. With a "boom," the flask exploded, and the laboratory was filled with a garlic gas with strong toxicity. The two were like deflated balloons, as if the trial production work was about to disappear with this poisonous gas.

    "Old Yu, why don't you report to the leadership! This is not a joke, should we just forget about it!" Wang Sen was a little discouraged.

    "Is '1605' really only to be imported? No, absolutely not!" Yu Kainan cleared his head, dealt with the poisonous gas, and the experimental work started again from scratch.

    The next day, the trial production team summarized the cause of the explosion and continued the chlorination hydrolysis work. When adding water, they dripped it in like eye drops, drop by drop, while cooling it with ice on the outside. Colorless oily diethyl thiophosphoryl chloride was distilled out. Like all laborers seeing the fruitful results of their labor, their eyes shone with joy.

    After the final synthesis, "1605" was born. These ordinary people, who did not have profound knowledge, finally succeeded in the experiment.

    What is the insecticidal effect of Suining-made "1605"? Look, from animal toxicity experiments: when 1CC of West German-made "1605" is injected into a chicken, the chicken dies after ten minutes; when 1CC of Danish-made "1605" is injected into a chicken, the chicken dies after ten minutes. And in our country, when 0.2CC of Suining-made "1605" is injected into a chicken, the chicken dies in seven minutes. If we look at the field application experiments: a one in ten thousand solution of West German-made "1605" has an insecticidal rate of over 95%, a one in ten thousand solution of Danish-made "1605" has an insecticidal rate of over 90%, while a one in ten thousand solution of Suining-made "1605" also has an insecticidal rate of over 95%. This means that it surpassed West Germany and Denmark in animal toxicity experiments; in field application experiments, it surpassed Denmark and is on par with West Germany.

    People who have liberated their minds, people who dare to think, dare to act, and dare to create, be proud!

    遂宁“1605”的诞生
    罗运钧
    一只鸡打着偏偏，在房里四处奔窜，它只挣扎了七分钟光景，倒下去了。这是注射了0.2CC遂宁试制的“1605”杀虫药剂的结果。这一事实说明过去主要依靠国外进口的“1605”，现在我们用简单的设备也能生产了！
    试制成功“1605”的是哪些专家、科学家？
    不，是一些普通人！
    他们是遂宁专区工业交通局的干部余凯南，遂宁中学教师王森，群康染厂技术员刘伯禄，遂宁专区人民医院的谭药剂师。
    “化学世界”一书中，一个不到五百字的说明和一个简单的化学方程式，这就是他们仅有的资料。
    按照汉密尔登制作“1605”的方法，“1605”的合成原料：一是对硝基酚，一是硫代氯磷酸二乙脂。
    试制工作开始了。在满布试管、烧瓶的实验室里，王森和谭药剂师开始用硫酸、硝酸铜和石碳酸制取对硝基酚——制“1605”的第一步。没有降温设备，制出来的酚要被胶化。怎么办？他们在医院党委的帮助下，用做组织疗法的冰，做成了简单的降温设备。对硝基酚制成功了，取得了制造“1605”的第一个原料。
    第二步是制取硫代氯磷酸二乙脂。这是组成“1605”的主要原料，也是最棘手的工作。他们在仪器设备不足的情况下，没有绞拌的仪器“水银封”，便用玻璃管代替。用酒精灯蒸馏达不到沸点，便采取直接加高热代替……终于取得了硫代氯磷酸二乙脂的第一道原料硫代磷酸二乙脂。
    制硫代氯磷酸二乙脂的最后一道工序，就是向硫代磷酸二乙脂通氯。
    已经是夜深人静的时候，余凯南和王森好像给临危的病人诊断，以万分的慎重和严肃态度，进行向硫代磷酸二乙脂通氯的工作。当完成氯化、进行水解时，出乎意料之外的事发生了。“轰”一声，烧瓶爆炸了，实验室里弥漫着带有强烈毒性的大蒜气，两人都像放了气的皮球，好像试制工作就要随着这股毒气烟消云散。
    “老余，你还是去给领导上汇报一下吧！这不是好玩的，是不是算了吧！”王森有些泄气了。
    “难道1605硬是只能用进口货？不，决不！”余凯南清醒了一下头脑，处理了毒气，实验工作又从新开始了。
    第二天，试制小组总结了爆炸的原因，继续进行氯化水解工作。在加水时，像滴眼药一样，一滴一滴的滴进去，同时外面用冰降温。无色油状液体的硫代氯磷酸二乙脂分馏出来了。像一切劳动者看见自己劳动后的丰硕果实一样，他们眼里放出愉快的光芒。
    经过最后的合成，“1605”诞生了。这几位并没有高深学问的普通人，终于试验成功了。
    遂宁制的“1605”的杀虫效果怎样呢？看吧，从动物毒性实验看：西德制“1605” 1CC注射在鸡体内，鸡在十分钟后死亡；丹麦制“1605”1CC注射在鸡体内，鸡十分钟后死亡。而我国，遂宁制的“1605”0.2CC注射在鸡体内，鸡在七分钟后就死亡了。如果从田间施用实验看：西德制十万分之一“1605”溶液，杀虫率在95％以上，丹麦制十万分之一“1605”溶液，杀虫率在90％以上，而遂宁制十万分之一“1605”溶液，杀虫率也在95％以上。这就是说：它在动物毒性实验上超过了西德和丹麦；在田间施用实验上，超过了丹麦，正和西德并驾齐驱。
    解放了思想的人们，敢想敢干敢创造的人们，自豪吧！
