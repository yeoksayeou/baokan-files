Also Talking About Indigenous and Foreign
Zhang Ke

    During the Great Leap Forward, new inventions and creations continue to emerge, mostly from the hands of the working people. To indicate this origin, these inventions and creations are often prefixed with the word "indigenous," called indigenous machines, indigenous fertilizers, indigenous pesticides, indigenous methods, and so on. In the old days, people often had a slightly contemptuous and disparaging attitude towards the word "indigenous." Nowadays, this word "indigenous" is full of pride and appreciation—workers can create machines, fertilizers, etc., themselves, without necessarily relying on "foreign" ones.

    In fact, indigenous things and indigenous methods are often more suitable for specific situations at the present stage. Taking the materials on several indigenous pesticides published in today's newspaper, these pesticides cost little or no money, the raw materials are easy to find, the method is simple, and they can be manufactured in large quantities, and the insecticidal efficiency is very high. This means that insect pests can be eliminated quickly and economically. This is, of course, more applicable to the vast rural areas that have not yet completely escaped poverty.

    However, some people have not changed their old ideas about "indigenous" and "foreign," so they are always lacking in confidence in indigenous things. For example, they are always skeptical about indigenous pesticides. When others are actively trying to produce and promote them, they not only stand by and watch, but also say discouraging things or nitpick in every possible way. The main reason for these people is that the spirit of slavery and inferiority complex are still at play, the superstition of "foreign" things has not been broken, and they believe that everything indigenous is inferior to foreign; or they believe that only scientists can study pesticides, and only large factories can manufacture pesticides. Peasants! Without scientific knowledge or machinery and equipment, how can they do this stuff! Even if they manage to make it, it will be crude and useless.

    These people are wrong. They have not figured out where science comes from. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Practice": "Man's knowledge depends mainly on his activity in material production, gradually understanding the phenomena, properties, and laws of nature… All this knowledge cannot be obtained without productive activity." This means that productive practice is the source of all scientific knowledge. The working people have been engaged in productive activities for many years, and of course they have accumulated rich scientific knowledge. It's just that they are busy with production and limited by their literacy, so they cannot summarize and improve it.

    Recently, many places have relied on the masses to not only discover many pesticide raw materials, but also produce large quantities of finished products. Santai County in Sichuan is a place where rice and cotton diseases and insect pests are relatively serious. This year, the county plans to control insects ten times, not allowing pests to damage a single seedling. However, although the chemical pesticides supplied by the commercial departments have increased five times compared with last year, they can only meet the needs of insect control twice. In order to solve the contradiction of insufficient pesticides, the Santai County Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the method of using indigenous pesticides to control insects. More than 2,000 agricultural cooperatives in the county have universally established indigenous pesticide processing plants, and have now produced more than 800,000 catties of indigenous pesticides, which basically solves the needs of pest control. Chen Dadui, deputy director of the Xingguang Cooperative in Nankang County, Jiangxi Province, developed an indigenous pesticide with an insecticidal efficiency stronger than "666." It can kill more than ten kinds of rice pests at a time, and even the difficult-to-treat paddy field mosquitoes are killed (it is said that some scientists are planning to study drugs to kill paddy field mosquitoes several years later). These facts show that the working masses are fully capable of manufacturing very good pesticides.

    Does relying on the masses mean that scientists are not needed? No. In this era of scientific bloom everywhere, it is also an era in which scientists can make great achievements. As long as scientists can go deep into reality, closely contact the masses, and improve on the basis of the existing creations of the masses, they can achieve twice the result with half the effort. The broad masses of working people very much hope that scientific workers will do this. Some scientific workers have already done this, and the masses are very grateful to them and love them.

    Relying on indigenous pesticides does not mean that pesticides manufactured by large factories are not needed. It's just that indigenous pesticides can now be manufactured in large quantities and can solve the current needs of insect control, so they should be the main focus. At present, some indigenous pesticides are not as good as "foreign" pesticides in terms of quality and efficiency, but in large-scale manufacturing and repeated practice, the quality will gradually improve and the efficiency will gradually stabilize. This is called improving from popularization.

    也谈土和洋
    张克
    大跃进中，新的创造发明不断出现，大部出自劳动人民之手。为了指明这个出处，这些发明创造常常加上“土”字头，叫做土机器、土化肥、土农药、土办法，等等。在旧时代，人们提到“土”字多少总有些轻蔑和鄙薄的成分，如今这个“土”字却充满了自豪和赞赏的意味——劳动者自己也会创造机器、化肥等，并不一定要用“洋”的。
    事实上，土东西、土办法在现阶段常常是更加适合具体情况的。就以今天本报发表的几个土农药的材料来看，这些农药花钱少或不花钱，原料易找，做法简单，可以大量制造，而且杀虫效率很高。这就是说，可以又快又省地扑灭虫害。这对于尚未完全摆脱贫困的广大农村，当然是更适用的。
    然而，有一些人因为对“土”和“洋”的老观念没有改变，所以对土东西总是信心不足。比如对土农药，就总是抱着怀疑的态度。在别人积极地试制推广时，他们不仅是袖手旁观，还说泄气话，或者百般挑剔。这些人主要是奴隶精神和自卑心理还在作怪，对“洋”东西的迷信没有破除，认为一切都是土的不如洋的好；或者是认为只有科学家才能研究农药，只有大工厂才能制造农药。农民呢！既无科学知识，又无机器设备，怎能搞这玩艺！即使勉强搞出来了，也是粗制滥造，无济于事。
    这些人错了。他们没有弄清楚科学是从哪儿来的。毛泽东同志在“实践论”中说：“人的认识，主要地依赖于物质的生产活动，逐渐地了解自然的现象、自然的性质、自然的规律性……。一切这些知识，离开生产活动是不能得到的。”这就是说生产实践是一切科学知识的根源。劳动人民长年进行生产活动，当然就会积累起丰富的科学知识。只不过因为忙于生产，限于文字能力，不能总结提高罢了。
    最近不少地方依靠群众，不仅发现很多农药原料，而且制出大宗成品。四川三台县是一个水稻棉花病虫害比较严重的地方，今年这个县准备治虫十次，不让害虫损害一株苗。可是商业部门供应的化学农药虽然比去年增加了五倍，但也只能供治虫两次的需要。中共三台县委为了解决农药不足的矛盾，提出了土药治虫的办法，全县二千多个农业社普遍建立土农药加工厂，现已制出八十多万斤土农药，基本上解决了防治虫害的需要。江西南康县星光社副社长陈大兑试制的土农药，杀虫效率比“六六六”还强，一次可以杀死十多种水稻害虫，就连那难治的稻田蚊子也被杀死了（据说有的科学家正在订规划，准备在几年以后才能研究出灭杀稻田蚊子的药）。这些事实都说明，劳动群众是完全可以制造很好的农药的。
    依靠群众，是不是就不需要科学家了呢？不是的。在这科学遍地开花的时代，也正是科学家大有可为的时代。科学家们只要能够深入实际，密切联系群众，在群众已有的创造的基础上再来提高，那就能够事半功倍。广大劳动群众是十分希望科学工作者这样做的。有一些科学工作者已经这样做了，群众非常感谢他们，爱戴他们。
    依靠土农药也不等于就不要大工厂制造的农药。只是因为土农药现在就可以大量制造，能解决目前治虫的需要，所以应当以它为主。目前有一些土农药在质量和效率上还不及“洋”农药，但在大量制造和反复实践中，质量一定会逐步提高，效率也会逐步稳定。这叫做从普及中提高。
