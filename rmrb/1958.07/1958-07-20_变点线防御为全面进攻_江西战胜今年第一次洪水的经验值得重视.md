Turning point and line defense into a comprehensive offensive
Jiangxi's experience in overcoming this year's first flood is worth paying attention to
Jiangxi Province has adopted the method of large-scale cooperation between mountainous areas, plains, hills, and upper, middle, and lower reaches, and has achieved a great victory in the first flood prevention and rescue.
In early and mid-May, torrential rains fell continuously in various parts of Jiangxi Province. The average rainfall in the Shangrao area reached more than 500 millimeters, and individual places even exceeded 600 millimeters, accounting for about one-third of the annual rainfall. The water levels of various rivers rose sharply. Due to the simultaneous rise of floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Fu River and the Gan River, coupled with the outbreak of mountain floods in the Luoxiao Mountains, the waterlogging situation in the Ganfu Plain area far exceeded that of the extraordinary flood in 1954.
Faced with the serious threat of flood disasters, the Provincial Party Committee proposed that all areas, regardless of flood season or non-flood season, must fully mobilize the masses to go all out; the upper and lower reaches should work together to implement large-scale water storage and flood prevention in the upper reaches and non-flood season areas, and the lower reaches and flood season areas should step up flood prevention and rescue work, so as to change from passive, simple point and line defense to active and comprehensive offense against floods.
In order to implement the above principles and requirements, party organizations at all levels immediately mobilized all cadres and the vast masses of the province. In addition to filling all the province's ponds, reservoirs, lakes and other projects with water, they also made full use of the province's 36 million mu of paddy fields to store water and prevent floods, which had a significant effect on lowering flood levels. For example, in early May last year, the rainfall in the upper reaches of the Xin River was 154 millimeters, and the water level in the lower reaches reached 25 meters. During the same period this year, the rainfall exceeded more than double that of last year, while the water level was only equal to that of last year.
In this flood prevention and rescue struggle, all cadres and the broad masses of the people, under the leadership of party and government at all levels, demonstrated a high degree of socialist enthusiasm and a high degree of responsibility. According to incomplete statistics, more than 12,000 cadres at or above the township level in the province personally led the masses to participate in flood prevention and rescue. A total of 1.8 million people were involved in flood prevention and rescue in the flood-stricken areas, more than twice the number of people involved in the 1954 extraordinary flood. In a very short period of time, a massive and magnificent upsurge of flood prevention and rescue was formed throughout the province. The flood prevention armies in various places were full of vigor and high morale, and successively put forward heroic and bold slogans such as "For the Great Leap Forward, protect the dikes as if protecting our lives, and we will never stop fighting until we conquer the floods," "Only allow the water to run away, not allow the dikes to collapse," and "No matter how fierce the floods are, we must have a bumper harvest." Thanks to the timely emergency measures taken by the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee and the concerted efforts of the party, government, army and people throughout the province, and their brave and arduous struggles, they finally overcame the floods, ensured the safety of the main dikes of major rivers, and rescued more than 3.2 million mu of farmland that had been flooded, achieving a great victory in the first flood prevention and rescue this year.
The main basic experiences of this flood prevention and rescue in achieving a great victory are as follows:
1. Making early and full preparations for flood prevention and rescue in terms of ideology, organization and materials before the arrival of the flood is an important prerequisite for overcoming the flood.
2. Vigorously implementing the communist large-scale cooperation of upstream water storage, downstream flood prevention and drainage; non-flood season water storage and flood season flood prevention has a significant effect on overcoming flood disasters. Experience has proved that as long as we emancipate our minds, break with conventions, jump out of the old circle of passive point and line defense, and actively adopt large-scale cooperation between mountainous hills, plains, upper reaches and lower reaches, and launch an overall war with the flood, we can take the initiative and comprehensively control the flood. This measure is a new and strategically important measure for overcoming floods. In the past, the struggle for flood prevention and rescue was limited to raising and strengthening the dikes in the lower reaches of each river, and strictly defending dangerous sections. Although these measures were necessary and played a great role in overcoming floods, they should continue to be done well in the future, but these measures alone cannot completely overcome floods.
3. Strong support from all directions is also an important guarantee for overcoming floods. The victory of the first flood prevention and rescue this year was not only due to the close cooperation between the upper and lower reaches, but also to the strong support from various departments and aspects. For example, the transportation department allocated more than 30 steamers to participate in the flood prevention and rescue struggle. In addition to temporarily allocating 6,400 cubic meters of urgently needed timber and 80,000 mao bamboo, the commercial and forestry departments specially went to Tianjin and Shanghai to transfer lead wire, and purchased grass bags from Jiangsu. These neighboring provinces gave us enthusiastic help and strong support. Local authorities, troops, factories, schools, and residents have also been fully mobilized and enthusiastically participated in the flood prevention and rescue struggle.
4. Relying on the masses to obtain materials locally is an important measure to solve the shortage of flood control materials and overcome floods. Nanchang, Poyang, and Qingjiang counties have implemented this spirit, not only mobilizing the masses to quickly clean up the original large number of flood control materials, but also relying on the masses to rush to make 670,000 grass bags in a week; Fengcheng County launched a "donate materials" campaign overnight, mobilizing more than 60,000 urban residents, workers, farmers, cadres, and students, and donated more than 74,000 grass bags, 28,000 kilograms of rice straw, and a large amount of bamboo, wood, door panels, and other materials within 15 hours, ensuring the needs of flood prevention and rescue.
5. Close integration of flood prevention and rescue with the restoration of production is an important link in overcoming floods and reducing disaster losses. When the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee began to arrange for flood prevention and rescue, they also emphasized the follow-up work after the flood receded and deployed measures to restore production.

    变点线防御为全面进攻
    江西战胜今年第一次洪水的经验值得重视
    江西省采取山区、平原、丘陵，上、中、下游大协作的办法，取得了第一次防洪抢险的大胜利。
    5月上、中旬，江西省各地连降暴雨，上饶地区平均达到五百公厘以上，个别地方竟超过了六百公厘，约占全年降雨量的三分之一，各河水位急剧上涨。由于抚河和赣江中、下游洪水同时上涨，加上罗山山脉山洪暴发，使赣抚平原地区远远超过了1954年特大洪水时期的渍水情况。
    面对着洪水灾害的严重威胁，省委提出：不论汛区和非汛区，都必须充分发动广大群众全力以赴；上、下游通力协作，实行上游和非汛区大量蓄水防洪，下游和汛区加紧做好防洪抢险工作，以便由被动的单纯的点线防御，转变为积极的、主动的、全面的向洪水进攻。
    为了贯彻上述方针和要求，各级党的组织立即动员全体干部和全省广大群众，除将全省所有的平塘、水库、湖泊等工程全部蓄满水以外，还充分利用全省三千六百万亩水稻田蓄水防洪，对于降低洪水水位收到了显著效果。如去年5月上旬信江上游降雨一百五十四公厘，下游水位达到二十五公尺，今年同期降雨量超过去年一倍以上，而水位只与去年相等。
    在这次防洪抢险斗争中，全体干部和广大群众在各级党政的领导下，发挥了高度的社会主义积极性和高度的责任心。据不完全统计：全省亲自率领群众投入防洪抢险的乡以上干部共达一万二千多人。在汛区投入防洪抢险的群众共达一百八十万人，超过1954年特大洪水时期抢险人数的两倍以上。在很短的时间内，在全省形成了一个声势浩大、规模壮阔的防洪抢险高潮。各地防汛大军气势磅礴，斗志昂扬，纷纷提出：“为了大跃进，保堤如保命，不战胜洪水，决不收兵”、“只准水跑，不准堤倒”、“任凭洪水凶猛，我们也要丰收”等英勇豪迈的口号。这一次的防洪抢险斗争，由于省委、省人民委员会及时采取了紧急措施，在全省范围内贯彻了上、下游、山区、平原共产主义大协作和全省党政军民同心协力，奋勇苦战，终于战胜了洪水，确保了各大河流的干堤安全，抢救了被洪水淹没的农田三百二十多万亩，取得了今年第一次防洪抢险的巨大胜利。
    这次防洪抢险之所以取得巨大胜利，主要有以下几条基本经验：
    1、在洪水到来之前，及早地、充分地从思想上、组织上和物资上作好防洪抢险的准备工作是战胜洪水的一个重要前提。
    2、大力贯彻执行上游蓄水，下游防洪排泄；非汛区蓄水，汛区防洪的共产主义大协作，这对于战胜洪水灾害具有重大的作用。经验证明，只要解放思想，打破陈规，跳出被动的点线防御的旧圈子，积极采取山区丘陵、平原、上游、下游大协作，与洪水展开总体战，就可以掌握主动，全面地控制洪水。这一措施，对于战胜洪水是一项新的具有战略意义的重要措施。过去把防洪抢险斗争，仅限于各河道下游加高加固圩堤，严密防守险段，这些措施虽然是必要的，对于战胜洪水也起了很大作用，今后还应当继续做好，但是只有这些措施是不能彻底战胜洪水的。
    3、四面八方，大力支援，也是战胜洪水的一项重要保证。今年第一次防洪抢险取得胜利，不仅上下游密切配合，协同作战，而且各个部门、各个方面都进行了大力支援。如交通部门调拨了三十余艘汽轮参加防汛抢险斗争，商业部门和林业部门除临时调拨急需的木材六千四百多立方公尺，茅竹八万根以外，特前往天津、上海调进了铅丝，到江苏购进了草袋，这些邻省都给我们以热情帮助和大力支援。各地机关、部队、工厂、学校、居民也都作了充分的动员，踊跃地投入防洪抢险斗争。
    4、依靠群众就地取材，是解决防汛器材不足和战胜洪水的重要措施。南昌、波阳、清江三县，贯彻了这个精神，不仅发动群众迅速清理出原有的大批防汛器材，而且在一个星期内依靠群众赶制了六十七万条草袋；丰城县连夜发动城镇居民、工人、农民、干部、学生六万余人，展开了“献器材”运动，在十五小时内即献出草袋七万四千多条，稻草两万八千斤，和大量的竹子、木材、门板等器材，保证了防洪抢险的需要。
    5、防洪抢险与恢复生产密切结合是战胜洪水、减少灾害损失的一个重要环节。省委、省人民委员会在开始布置防洪抢险的时候，就同时强调了洪水退落后的善后工作，部署了恢复生产的措施。
