    Suzhou Manufactures 1500x Microscope
    Matching UK Counterpart
    Young assistant teachers from Suzhou Medical College and workers from the Suzhou Optical Instrument and Spectacle Production Cooperative collaborated to successfully trial-produce a stylish, easy-to-use, 1500x oblique-view microscope on June 25th, named the "Red Flag Brand" microscope. After inspection, its quality has matched that of similar microscopes in the UK; the magnification has reached the highest level in our country.

    Those responsible for manufacturing the microscope were Zhu Yonglin, Chen Tong, Wu Bingwen, Qin Zhenhua, and Yu Rongli, a lathe operator from the medical college's physics experiment workshop, all ordinary workers from the Optical Instrument and Spectacle Cooperative. The equipment they used consisted of only two old-fashioned small lathes, a small drilling machine, and some simple, locally-made tools.

    The Red Flag Brand microscope is designed to be quite beautiful and practical. Qin Cheng, an assistant teacher from the physics teaching and research group of Suzhou Medical College, who was responsible for the design and drafting, was also attempting this for the first time. During the design process, he absorbed and concentrated the advantages of microscopes from Switzerland, East Germany, and the UK, and made significant innovations. For example, the coarse and fine adjustments of the Swiss Wild travelling microscope are installed on the upper and lower axes, but are now modified to be on the same axis, making it easier to use. The outer casing of the microscope is made of organic glass, and the main parts of the microscope are made of aluminum alloy, which reduces weight and makes it easier to carry. (Xinhua Daily)

### 苏州制成1500倍显微镜  赶上了英国同类型的显微镜

    苏州制成1500倍显微镜
    赶上了英国同类型的显微镜
    苏州医学院青年助教和苏州市光学仪器眼镜生产合作社工人合作，于6月25日试制成功了一架式样美观，使用方便，能放大一千五百倍的斜视式显微镜，命名为“红旗牌”显微镜。经检验，其质量已赶上英国同类型的显微镜；放大倍数已达我国最高水平。
    担任显微镜制造工作的是光学仪器眼镜合作社社员朱永霖、陈彤、吴炳文、秦振华和医学院物理实验工场的车工余融丽等普通工人。他们所用的设备只有两部老式小车床、一部小钻床和一些简陋的土制工具。
    红旗牌显微镜设计得相当美观、适用。担任设计、绘图工作的苏州医学院物理教研组助教秦诚，也是第一次试作。在设计过程中，他吸取和集中了瑞士、民主德国及英国的显微镜的优点，再作了重要革新。比方：粗细调节，瑞士Wild的旅行式显微镜是装置在上下两轴上的，现在改装在同一轴上，这样使用方便。显微镜的外罩用有机玻璃制成，显微镜的主要部分都采用了铝合金，这样可减轻分量，携带方便。　（新华日报）
