Xinhua News Agency, Sofia Electric Dispatch. An article published by the editorial department of the Bulgarian "Workers' Cause Newspaper" on June 22nd listed specific facts proving that the Yugoslav revisionists are agents and servants of imperialism in the international workers' movement.

The article said that today, in the struggle waged by modern revisionists against the international communist and workers' movement and the socialist camp, Yugoslav revisionism stands at the forefront. This is the most vicious, the most insidious, and also the most brazen revisionism. In terms of ideological struggle, the imperialist propaganda machine is enthusiastically using it to oppose the communist parties of various countries and the socialist countries. The reactionary forces of imperialism have found the best agents in the Yugoslav Communist leadership group and are placing their main hopes on these agents.

The article pointed out that in the past, Yugoslav revisionists have served international imperialism more than once. Recalling their actions during the 1956 Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots is enough to prove this. At that time, Yugoslav revisionism was the direct instigator of this riot and its leaders and organizers – the Hungarian revisionists headed by Nagy and Losonczy. After the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots were quelled, when the whole world condemned the robber invasion of the peace-loving Egyptian people by the British and French imperialists, and imperialism was in a serious and difficult moment, the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist Party launched a reckless slanderous campaign against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. This was nothing but helping imperialism. Of course, this kind of help was generously rewarded – a large number of American loans. The United States provides the Yugoslav revisionists with such or other loans, all based on "repaying kindness with kindness."

The article then pointed out that the program adopted by the Seventh Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party and the speeches made by the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist Party at this meeting were the culmination of this line of directly serving imperialism. The program and speeches beautified imperialism, especially American imperialism. At the same time, the program and speeches made the most despicable slanders against the Soviet Communist Party and other fraternal parties, against the Soviet Union and other countries in the world socialist camp. As is well known, the communist parties and workers' parties of the world unanimously condemned this anti-communist line pursued by the Yugoslav Communist leadership group. Now the Yugoslav revisionists continue to implement this line. For example, at present, the issue of convening a summit meeting to maintain peace has matured. The people of the world are resolutely demanding that this meeting be held in the shortest possible time. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries are striving to convene this meeting. However, the United States and other imperialist countries are trying to make this meeting fail at any cost, and are trying to attribute the failure to the Soviet Union. At this moment, which is so important to all mankind, the Yugoslav "Combat Daily" slandered the Soviet government in an editorial article responding to the "Pravda" comment on the Seventh Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party, saying that the Soviet government's policy of maintaining world peace is insincere and hypocritical! A few days ago, Tito expressed similar doubts about the peace-loving policy of the People's Republic of China in his speech in Labin! Now, when imperialism is in a difficult situation, is there any better help for imperialism than this? This is the duty of the servants of imperialism, the modern revisionists.

The article finally said that just as it has defeated all hostile factions up to now, Marxism-Leninism will victoriously overcome modern revisionism. The wheel of world history is advancing non-stop towards socialism and communism, and the humble servants of imperialism, the modern revisionists, will surely be crushed by the wheel of history along with imperialism.

    保加利亚“工人事业报”发表文章指出
    南修正主义分子是帝国主义的代理人
    他们定将同帝国主义一起被历史车轮压碎
    新华社索非亚电  保加利亚“工人事业报”编辑部6月22日发表的文章中列举具体事实，证明南斯拉夫修正主义分子是帝国主义在国际工人运动中的代理人和佣仆。
    文章说，今天在现代修正主义分子进行的反对国际共产主义和工人运动以及社会主义阵营的斗争中，站在最前面的是南斯拉夫的修正主义。这是最恶毒、最隐蔽、同时也是最厚颜无耻的修正主义。在思想斗争方面，帝国主义宣传机器正热心地利用它来反对各国共产党和各个社会主义国家。帝国主义反动势力从南共领导集团那里找到了最好的代理人，并且把他们的主要希望寄托在这些代理人身上。
    文章指出，过去南斯拉夫的修正主义分子就曾经不止一次地为国际帝国主义效劳。回忆一下他们在1956年匈牙利反革命暴乱期间的作为就足以证明这一点。当时，南斯拉夫的修正主义是这一暴乱及其领导者和组织者——以纳吉和洛松齐为首的匈牙利修正主义分子——的直接鼓舞者。匈牙利反革命暴乱被扑灭后，当全世界痛斥英法帝国主义分子对爱好和平的埃及人民的强盗侵略、帝国主义处于严重而困难的时刻，南共领导人却开始了肆无忌惮的反对苏联和其他社会主义国家的造谣诽谤运动。这不是别的，乃是帮助帝国主义。当然这种帮助曾经得到慷慨的报酬——大量的美国贷款。美国提供给南斯拉夫修正主义分子的无论这种或是其他的贷款。都是以“以德报德”为基础的。
    文章接着指出，南共第七次代表大会通过的纲领和南共领导人在这次会议上的讲话是这种直接为帝国主义效劳的路线的登峰造极。纲领和讲话美化帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义。同时，纲领和讲话对苏共和其他兄弟党、对苏联和世界社会主义阵营的其他国家，进行了最卑劣的诽谤。如所周知，世界各国共产党和工人党一致谴责南共领导集团执行的这种反共产主义的路线。现在南斯拉夫修正主义分子仍然继续执行着这种路线。例如，目前，召开最高级会议以维护和平的问题已经成熟了。世界各国人民都坚决主张在最短期间内举行这种会议。苏联和其他社会主义国家政府正尽力争取召开这一会议。但是美国和其他帝国主义国家政府却正在企图不惜任何代价来使这一会议的召开归于失败，并企图把失败归咎于苏联。在这对全人类都是这样重要的时刻，南斯拉夫“战斗报”却在一篇回答“真理报”评论南共七大的文章的编辑部文章里，诽谤苏联政府说，苏联政府维护世界和平的政策是不真诚的、伪善的！前几天，铁托在拉宾演说时同样地表示怀疑中华人民共和国的爱好和平的政策！现在当帝国主义正处于一种困难局面的时候，还有比这种帮助对帝国主义更好的吗？这就是帝国主义的佣仆，现代修正主义分子的职务。
  文章最后说，正像到现在为止战胜所有的敌对派别一样，马克思列宁主义定将胜利地克服现代修正主义。世界历史的车轮正在不停地向社会主义和共产主义前进，帝国主义的卑贱的佣仆现代修正主义分子定将同帝国主义一起被历史的车轮压碎。
