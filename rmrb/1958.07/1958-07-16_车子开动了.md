    The Car Has Started Moving...
    Yan Ling
    One morning in May, I ran into the County Party Secretary and carpenter Zhang Shanxian on the streets of Yanchang County. They were walking shoulder to shoulder, talking as they went. When I asked them where they were going, they said they were going to the Guangming Wood Industry Production Cooperative. I followed them there.
    In the woodworking shop of the cooperative, Zhang Tan and Zhang Shanxian were discussing the manufacture of tampers with the people of the cooperative. I was drawn to a strange mill that was turning. A donkey stood in the middle of a hollow wooden gear, pulling it around. The large gear drove a small gear, and the mill spun rapidly. At the same time, crushed wheat that had been ground once could automatically flow into a large cabinet; inside the cabinet was a cylindrical copper wire sieve, which was also working automatically – also driven by gears. The comrades from the cooperative said that this mill could produce more than 600 jin of flour a day, increasing efficiency fivefold compared to ordinary mills.
    It is the crystallization of collective wisdom. Zhu Yongchang, the deputy director of the cooperative, and technician Zhao Zhenyou designed the drawings and explained them to the members; the members came together to study this new thing, adding their improved suggestions. Everyone worked together, using both their hands and their brains; after five days, it was turning in front of us. Soon, it would go to the Second Commercial Bureau's flour mill to serve the people.
    In the past, the farmers here did not use seed drills for planting; they all used rough broadcasting. To help promote strip planting for increased production, this cooperative manufactured hillside seed drills for the farmers of Yanchang, and also went to the masses of farmers to solicit opinions, making them even better to use.
    When they heard that the water conservancy construction sites urgently needed tool reforms, and that the completed water conservancy projects urgently needed water lifting tools, they immediately sent people to the water conservancy construction sites. Starting from the "May Day" holiday, one new tool after another was designed. Soon, self-tipping dump carts and foot-operated tampers were made, and two sets of high-line earth and water transport equipment were also designed, as well as a purely wooden manpower water lifting machine, a light hand-cranked waterwheel, and a one-well four-pipe animal-powered waterwheel, which were being test-produced.
    When I arrived at the office of the Guangming Wood Industry Cooperative, I saw Deputy Director Zhu Yongchang drawing a new design. He said that this was a foot-operated saw, which they were preparing for the cooperative's own use; they had test-produced one in the past, but it was not very labor-saving; now they were going to redesign it. As he spoke, he took out a thick stack of design drawings for various water lifting tools and transportation tools – all of which were their new works. We passed them around, looking at them one by one. The more I looked, the more interested I became, and the more excited I became. In front of me, these design drawings, drawn on thin pink copy paper rather than on expensive drafting paper, were like a large flock of wise spring swallows, flying back and forth busily; I loved them, but I also felt a little dizzy.
    They wanted to make so many new things. But their total number of members was only a little more than thirty people. Their main products in the past were just tables, chairs, benches, cabinets, coffins...
    Cooperative Director Cao Shengan took us to their spare-time school classroom. It was a fairly formalized classroom. It was to be expected that the desks were made by the members themselves. But I didn't expect that they were made entirely in their spare time; the wood was also earned through overtime work. The members had a great enthusiasm for learning culture and technology. All the members attended two hours of classes every night, most of the time was spent learning culture, some time was spent learning politics, and some time was spent learning technology. The enthusiasm for improving technology stimulated the enthusiasm for learning culture. The cultural teacher was Deputy Director Zhu Yongchang, and the technical teacher was the cooperative's technician Zhao Zhenyou; learning politics mainly involved reading the newspaper. Cooperative Director Cao Shengan said that after the rectification campaign, everyone's political awareness had been raised; all walks of life were in the midst of a great leap forward, and the members' enthusiasm was even greater; in the past, they read the newspaper once a week, but now they read the newspaper every day. As soon as the newspaper arrives, everyone rushes to read it.
    The seven members with relatively strong technical skills formed a technical research group. This was the technical core of the entire cooperative; it taught technology to all the members, attracted the members to study new technologies, and at the same time, these few people constantly studied newer and higher technologies.
    The technical and cultural level of the entire cooperative has rapidly improved. All the members have shed their illiteracy, they can all read design drawings, their work efficiency and the qualified rate of products have greatly improved, and they are also saving more labor and materials than in the past.
    Their courage has also grown.
    "Aren't you afraid of wasting labor and losing money by making so many new products?" After hearing their reply, I regretted that I had asked this foolish question, which was so out of tune with the spirit of our times.
    "We haven't considered whether we'll lose money or not. Every new thing, we discuss it again and again before we make it, and we only consider it a success if it doesn't fail. Even if we do lose money, it's no big deal! We're collectivized! Our strength is great, we're not afraid of anything! After collectivization, our 'research ability' has increased; the better the cooperative develops, the greater our courage becomes, and we're no longer afraid of not having a secure life. When we formed the cooperative team in the spring of 1954, we had just embarked on a new path, and everyone still felt uncomfortable, and they often argued. Later, when it was transformed into a cooperative, it became sweeter and sweeter; now, when we think back to the disharmony of the single-household and team periods, everyone finds it laughable."
    "This spring, there's a great leap forward, and the whole country is developing greatly, so we're also following the great leap forward and the great development. We want to catch up with Britain! Who isn't energized? Who doesn't want to create? Who doesn't want to learn skills here? The training we've received in this half-month of the great leap forward is much more than we've received in the past; in the future, there will be even more opportunities to learn and show off our skills. In another year, things will be very different! We're too busy welcoming new tasks, how could we be afraid of anything!"
    In the evening, on the banks of the Yan River, I saw a group of people crowding around some object, wading across the Yan River to the opposite river flat. When I got closer, I realized that it was a two-wheeled double-furrow plow that had been modified. It had just been modified by the Yanchang Agricultural Implement Repair Station, the Heping Iron Industry Production Cooperative, and a small iron industry group, which had merged and transformed into the Yanchang Agricultural Machinery Repair and Assembly Plant. It is said that the pulling force can be reduced by dozens of jin compared to the original.
    Last year, fifty hillside plows were shipped from Xi'an. Everyone said they were good to use, and they quickly sold out. The agricultural cooperatives asked the iron industry cooperative to make their own hillside plows. The iron industry cooperative could only repair new-style plows before; making them themselves, they had never even thought about it. But the agricultural cooperatives "challenged" them: "Since you can assemble parts, why can't you make them yourselves?" Well then, let's try it. The iron industry cooperative began to try making them. First, they made the plowshares. The first time they cast them, they couldn't be used; the second time, they still couldn't be used; the third time, they finally succeeded. They assembled one and tried it in the field, but the plowshare kept jumping. The members of the agricultural cooperative studied it together and found out where the problem was. They modified it, and carried it out to try it again, but it still didn't turn the soil very neatly. After repeated study, they found the problem again. They modified it again and tried it again, and it could be used. However, the farmers' comment was: "It can be used, but it's not as good as the ones made in Xi'an, and the price is too expensive." This spring, they studied it again and modified it again. The weight of the plow was reduced from 32.5 jin to 28.5 jin, and the price was reduced from 26 yuan to 20 yuan and a few jiao. They sent it to the Liming Agricultural Cooperative for trial use, and this time the mass appraisal comment was: "It's even better than the ones made in Xi'an!"
    They successfully trial-produced a manpower double-pipe water pump, and also successfully trial-produced a new-style hunting rifle. In the struggle to conquer nature and eliminate sparrows and harmful animals, the sounds of machinery and shooting brought people so much excitement and pleasure!
    The Yanchang Oil Mine recently allocated an eight-foot lathe to them. When the electric motor drives its wheels to spin rapidly, look at the facial expressions of the workers who have just switched from manual operation to learning how to operate the machine – how nervous, how joyful, and how proud they are!
    At night, in the County Party Committee conference room, there is another tense atmosphere. The comrades of the County Party Committee and the secretaries of the District Party Committees and Township Party Branches are together with the comrades of the Provincial Party Committee inspection team, and they are studying a topic that is very new to them: running industry.
    In the past, most of the oil produced in Yanchang had to be transported to Yan'an for processing; every year, more than 70,000 jin of clear oil had to be transported back from Yan'an. They are determined to run their own oil pressing plant.
    In the past, cotton stalks, *Ruru* strips, sheep's head shavings... were all burned for fuel, which was the same as burning a lot of cotton and hemp. Now they know that these things can be made into man-made fibers and paper. Alas, burned! What a pity! They decided to build a paper mill and a man-made fiber factory.
    How many treasures are lying idle in the mountains! They want to open coal mines, gypsum mines, and fire ceramics and cement...
    The water in the Yan River and the mountain gullies flows into the Yellow River for nothing. They decided to build six hydroelectric power stations to use electricity for irrigation, oil pressing, cotton ginning, lighting...
    The unfamiliar will become familiar if we do it.
    What we don't know will become known if we do it.
    The clouds of doubt gradually dissipated in the meeting; confidence rose from the crowd like the morning sun.
    The most important thing is to move quickly, and not fall behind the mass movement. Looking at the water conservancy construction sites, the wood industry cooperatives, and the iron industry cooperatives, and looking at the masses, haven't the seedlings of the technological revolution already grown vigorously?
    On the way back to Yan'an from Yanchang, even now, this voice still rings in my mind again and again: "This kind of technical innovation movement, like a car, has started moving, and will never stop, not for a day, not for ten thousand years." (Note)

    车子开动了………
    燕凌
    5月里的一个早晨，在延长县街上碰到县委书记和木匠张善贤。他们肩并着肩，边走边谈。问他们到哪里去，说是到光明木业生产合作社去。我随后也就到那里去了。
    在木业社的木工场里，张檀、张善贤同木业社的人们在商量制造打夯机的事情。我却被一盘正在转动的奇怪的磨子吸引着。一头驴子站在一个木制的空心大齿轮中间拉着它转，大齿轮带着小齿轮，磨子急速地旋转着。同时，磨过一遍的碎麦子可以自动流到一个大柜子里去；大柜子里有圆筒形的铜丝箩，在自动地工作着——也是齿轮带动了它。木业社的同志们说，这磨子一天能出六百多斤面粉，比一般的磨子提高效率五倍。
    它是集体智慧的结晶。木业社副主任朱永长和技术员赵振酉设计了图样，讲给社员们听；社员们一同来研究这个新鲜东西，把改进的意见加上去。大家一齐动手动脑；过了五天，它就在我们面前转动起来了。不久，它就要到第二商业局的面粉厂里去为人民服务。
    这里的农民过去种地不用耧，都是粗糙的撒播。为了帮助推行条播增产，这个木业社为延长农民制造了山地耧，还到农民群众中去听取意见，把它改造得更好使。
    他们听说水利工地迫切需要改革工具，修好的水利也迫切需要提水工具，就马上派人到水利工地去。从“五·一”节开始，一种又一种新工具设计出来了。很快就做成了自动倒土的架子车和脚踏打夯机，还设计了两套高线运土、运水的器械，一个纯用木料做的人力扬水机，一个轻便的手摇水车，一个一井四管畜力水车，正在试制。
    到了光明木业社的办公室，看到副主任朱永长正在画一个新的设计图。他说，这是一个脚踏锯，准备社里自己用的；过去试制了一个，不怎么省力；现在要重新设计一个。他说着拿出厚厚的一搭子各种提水工具、运输工具的设计图——都是他们的新作。我们一张一张传看着。我越看越感兴趣，越看越激动。在我面前，这些在薄薄的粉连纸上而不是在高贵的绘图纸上画着的设计图，像一大群智慧的春燕，穿梭般地飞来飞去；我喜爱它们，但也有些眼花缭乱了。
    他们要做这么多新鲜的东西。可是，他们的全部社员不过是三十多个人。他们过去的主要产品不过是些桌椅板凳、柜子、棺材……
    社主任曹升安把我们带到他们的业余学校教室里去。是一个相当正规化的教室。可以料想到，课桌是社员们自己做的。可是，我却没想到，完全是用业余时间做的；木料也是加班做活赚来的。社员们学文化、学技术的劲头很大。全体社员每天晚上都要上两小时课，大部分时间是学文化，一部分时间是学政治，一部分时间是学技术。提高技术的积极性又刺激了学文化的积极性。文化教员就是副主任朱永长，技术教员是社里的技术员赵振酉；学政治主要是读报。社主任曹升安说，整风以后，大家的政治觉悟提高了；各行各业都在大跃进，社员们的干劲也更大了；过去每星期读一次报，现在每天都要读报。报纸一来，大家抢着看。
    社里技术比较强的七个人，组成了技术研究组。这是全社的技术核心，它把技术教给全部社员，吸引社员们研究新技术，同时几个人又不断地研究更新更高的技术。
    全社的技术水平和文化水平迅速地提高了。全体社员都摘下了文盲帽子，都已经会看设计图，工作效率和产品的合格率大大提高了，也比过去更省工省料了。
    他们的胆子也就大起来了。
    “要造这么多新产品，不怕费工、赔本？”听了他们的回答，我才懊悔不该提出这个同我们的时代气息很不谐调的愚蠢的问题。
    “没考虑赔不赔。每一件新东西，要做的时候都经大家一次又一次讨论，总要叫它不落空才算。就是万一赔了，也没啥！合作化了么！力量就是大，啥也不怕！合作了以后，‘研究性’就大了；合作社越发展越好，胆量也越来越大了，再也不怕生活没保障了。1954年春天成立合作小组的时候，刚走新道路，大家还嫌不随便呢，时常乱吵吵。后来转成合作社，越来越甜；现在再回想单干的时候和小组的时候那不和气劲，谁也觉得可笑。”
    “今年春天大跃进，全国大发展，咱们也就跟着大跃进，大发展。要赶过英国呢！谁不带劲？谁不愿意创造？谁不愿意在这里头学本领？这半个月大跃进，我们受的锻炼就比过去多得多了；以后学本领、显本领的机会就更多了。再过一年，就会大不相同了！光怕欢迎新任务还来不及呢，还怕什么！”
    傍晚，在延河边，看到一群人簇拥着一个什么物件，踄过延河水，到对面的川地里去。走近去才知道是一部经过改装的双轮双铧犁。这是刚由延长农具修配站、和平铁业生产合作社和一个铁业小组合并转成的延长农业机械修配厂改装的。据说拉力可以比原先减轻好几十斤。
    去年，由西安运来了五十部山地犁。都说好使，很快就脱销了。农业社要求铁业社自己造山地犁。铁业社以前只能修理新式犁；自己造，可从来想也没想到过。可是，农业社“将”了他们一军：“你们既然能配零件，为什么不能自己造呢？”那末，就试试看吧。铁业社开始试制起来。先造犁头。第一次翻砂，不能用；第二次，还是不能用；第三次，终于成功了。装好一个，到地里一试，犁头爱跳。农业社社员一起研究，发现了毛病在哪里。改了，又扛出去试，翻土还是不大利索。反复研究，又找出了毛病。再改，再试，能用了。可是，农民的评语是：“用是能用了，可是没人家西安造的好，价钱也太贵，”今年春天，又研究，再改造。犁的重量由三十二斤半减少到二十八斤半，价钱由二十六元降低到二十元零几角。送到黎明农业社去试用，这一次群众鉴定的评语是：“比西安造的还好！”
    他们试制成功了人力双管抽水机，还试制成功了新式猎枪。在征服自然、消灭麻雀和害兽的斗争中，机械的声音和射击的声音带给人们多少兴奋和愉快！
    延长油矿最近拨给他们一部八尺车床。当电动机带动着它的轮子急速地转动的时候，你看，那刚由手工操作转而学会操纵机器的工人的面部表情吧——多么紧张，多么喜悦，又多么自豪！
    夜晚，在县委会议室里，又是一团紧张的气氛。县委的同志们和区委书记、乡支部书记们同省委检查团的同志们在一起，又在研究一个对他们来说是十分新颖的课题：办工业。
    过去，延长生产的油料大部分要运到延安加工；每年，又要从延安运回七万多斤清油。他们决心自办榨油厂。
    过去，棉花秆、茹茹条、羊头梢……都烧火了，等于把许多棉花和麻烧了。现在才知道，这些东西，能做成人造纤维、能造纸。唉呀，烧了！多可惜！他们决定办造纸厂、人造纤维厂。
    山里，有多少宝藏闲放在那里啊！要开煤矿、石膏矿，要烧瓷器、水泥……
    延河和山沟里的水，白白地流进黄河去了。他们决定建设六个水电站，用电力浇地、榨油、轧花、照明……
    生疏的，做，就能熟。
    不会的，做，就能会。
    疑云在会上渐渐地消散了；信心像朝阳一样从人群中升起。
    最要紧的是赶快动起来，不要落在群众运动的后面。看水利工地上，看木业社、铁业社里，看群众中间，技术革命的幼芽不是早已茁壮地生长起来了吗？
    从延长回延安的路上，直到现在，我的脑子里仍然一次又一次地响着这个声音：“这样的技术革新运动，像一部车子，已经开动了，永远不会停止，一天不停，一万年不停。”（注）
