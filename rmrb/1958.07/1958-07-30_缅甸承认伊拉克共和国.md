    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, July 29th: The government of the Union of Burma announced this evening that it has decided to recognize the government of the Republic of Iraq, and has notified the government of the Republic of Iraq of this decision through diplomatic channels.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Kuwait news: The government of Kuwait sent a telegram to the government of the Republic of Iraq on the 27th, congratulating Iraq on its prosperity and progress.
    Since the foreign relations of the Sheikhdom of Kuwait are controlled by Britain, and it does not have its own ambassadors stationed abroad, this congratulatory telegram from the Kuwaiti government to the government of the Republic of Iraq is equivalent to formal recognition.

    缅甸承认伊拉克共和国
    新华社仰光29日电　缅甸联邦政府今天晚上宣布，缅甸联邦政府决定承认伊拉克共和国政府，并且已经把这项决定经由外交途径通知了伊拉克共和国政府。
    新华社28日讯　科威特消息：科威特政府27日致电伊拉克共和国政府，祝贺伊拉克的繁荣和进步。
    由于科威特酋长国的对外关系受着英国的控制，它本身没有派驻外国的使节，因此，科威特政府给伊拉克共和国政府这个贺电就等于给予正式承认。
