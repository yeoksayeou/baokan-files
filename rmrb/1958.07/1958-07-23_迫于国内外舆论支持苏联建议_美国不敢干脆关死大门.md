Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch from Washington: After receiving the Soviet Union's Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's proposal to immediately convene a five-nation summit conference to discuss the Middle East issue, U.S. President Eisenhower held an unusual Sunday emergency meeting on the 20th with Secretary of State Dulles and other senior advisors to discuss countermeasures.

The White House subsequently issued a statement saying that the U.S. government is "carefully studying" the Soviet note and intends to make a "calm and constructive response" after "appropriate consultations." The statement also said that this response will "not harm" the work that the United Nations has already "begun."

The U.S. government's attitude of prevarication while not daring to completely close the door is due to pressure from broad public opinion at home and abroad. As can be seen from Western news agency reports, the U.S. government has no intention of accepting the Soviet proposal to negotiate a halt to its aggression in the Middle East. The real American reaction is "lukewarm," considering it "virtually impossible" to accept. The Associated Press pointed out that the White House is taking a "cautious" attitude only because it considers that the Soviet proposal will "win widespread public support."

On the other hand, the White House statement reveals that the United States' primary consideration at present is to exert every effort to use the United Nations as a cover for its acts of aggression, and it is completely unprepared to seriously discuss the immediate withdrawal of troops from the Middle East and the cessation of its aggression in a summit conference.

    迫于国内外舆论支持苏联建议
    美国不敢干脆关死大门
    新华社22日讯  华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在收到苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫关于立即召开五国首脑会议讨论中近东问题的建议以后，在20日同国务卿杜勒斯和其他高级顾问举行了不平常的星期日紧急会议，商量采取对策的问题。
    白宫随后发表声明说，美国政府正在“仔细研究”苏联照会，并且打算在“进行适当磋商以后”作出“冷静的和建设性的回答”。声明又说，这种回答将“不会损害”联合国已经“开始的工作”。
    美国政府采取这种支吾其词而又不敢干脆关死大门的态度是迫于国内外广大舆论的压力。从西方通讯社消息中可以看出，美国政府根本无意于接受苏联建议来谈判停止它在中东的侵略，美国的真实反应是“冷淡的”，认为“实际上不可能”接受。美联社指出，白宫所以要采取“小心翼翼的”态度，只是由于考虑到苏联的建议会“赢得广泛的公众的支持”。
    另一方面，白宫的声明透露了美国目前的主要考虑是要竭尽一切力量来利用联合国为它的侵略行为作掩护，而完全不准备在政府首脑会议中认真讨论立即从中东撤军和停止它的侵略行动。
