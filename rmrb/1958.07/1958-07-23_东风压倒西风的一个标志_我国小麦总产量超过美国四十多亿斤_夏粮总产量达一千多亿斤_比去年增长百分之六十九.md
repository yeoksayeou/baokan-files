Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: The Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China's 1958 Summer Harvest Grain Crop Production Communiqué

This year's summer grain crops have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The sown area was over 53.9 million mu, with a total output of 101 billion jin, an increase of 41.3 billion jin over the 1957 summer harvest grain crops, representing a 69% increase. The average yield per mu was 187 jin, a 70% increase over 1957. Among the summer grain crops, the sown area of winter wheat was over 35.6 million mu, with a total output of 68.9 billion jin, an increase of 27.9 billion jin over 1957, representing a 68% increase. The average yield per mu was 193 jin, a 71% increase over 1957.

In addition, approximately 45 million mu of spring wheat nationwide have not yet been harvested, with an estimated total output of around 9 billion jin.

The speed of this year's summer harvest and output growth is unprecedented. The increase in output this season alone exceeds the total grain increase in 1956 and 1957 combined by more than 20 billion jin. The increase in winter wheat output this summer harvest is more than double the total wheat increase in the past five years. In 1949, China's total wheat output was only 44% of the United States' total wheat output. This year, China's total wheat output has surpassed the United States. According to the latest figures, China's total winter and spring wheat output is 77.9 billion jin (assuming 9 billion jin for unharvested spring wheat). According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's estimate on July 10th, the United States' wheat output this year is 1.34349 billion bushels (each bushel of wheat is 27.22 kilograms), equivalent to 73.13 billion jin. Among them, winter wheat is 1.1297277 billion bushels, equivalent to 61.5 billion jin, and spring wheat is 213.763 million bushels, equivalent to 11.63 billion jin. This year, China's wheat output exceeds the United States' wheat output by at least 4.4 billion jin.

Counties and cities with high wheat yields:

Counties with yields exceeding 600 jin per mu include Gucheng County in Hubei and Meng County in Henan.

Counties and cities with yields exceeding 500 jin per mu include Yanshi, Bo'ai, Xiayi, Xiping, Xiangcheng, Lushan, Shangqiu City, Xichuan, and ? County in Henan; Gaocheng in Hebei; and Xiangfan City in Hubei (eleven counties and cities).

Counties and cities with yields exceeding 400 jin per mu include Luoyang City, Tongxu, Shenqiu, Changge, Wen County, Xixia, Anyang, Wuzhi, Suiping, and Anyang City in Henan; Xi'an, Hanzhong, and Xianyang City, Chang'an, Zhouzhi, Gaoling, and Hu County in Shaanxi (seven cities and counties); Zhengding, Shijiazhuang City, Xingtai City, Funing, and Anguo in Hebei (five cities and counties); Xiangyang and Yicheng in Hubei; and Pi County in Sichuan.

Special regions with yields exceeding 300 jin per mu include five regions: Xiangyang Special Region in Hubei; Shangqiu, Nanyang, and Xuchang Special Regions in Henan; and Tangshan Special Region in Hebei.

According to incomplete statistics from Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei provinces, the area with wheat yields exceeding 500 jin per mu is more than 9.24 million mu. Among them: over 754,300 mu yielded above 1,000 jin but less than 2,000 jin per mu; 4,236 mu yielded above 2,000 jin but less than 3,000 jin per mu; 267.47 mu yielded above 3,000 jin but less than 4,000 jin per mu; 34 mu yielded above 4,000 jin but less than 5,000 jin per mu. Chen Yanli, head of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative, and Feng Fuyao, captain of the fourth team, in Xiping County, Henan, achieved an average yield of 7,320 jin per mu on their two experimental mu, setting the national high-yield record for winter wheat in 1958. Liu Dazhen, head of the Mengjin Agricultural Cooperative, Li Zhenhua, vice-head, and Liu Lingqi, captain of the ninth team, in Xiping County, achieved a yield of 7,201 jin per mu on their 1.7 mu experimental plot. Gucheng County in Hubei had 8.7 mu with yields exceeding 5,000 jin per mu, with the 1.5 mu experimental plot of the Xinqixiang Fifth Cooperative reaching 5,467 jin per mu. The Lianfu Cooperative in Jiexiu County, Shanxi, achieved 5,702 jin per mu on their 1.04 mu of barley, setting the national high-yield record for barley in 1958. The Jianshe Cooperative in Chun'an County, Zhejiang, had 5.2 mu of peas yielding 2,074 jin per mu and 6 mu of broad beans yielding 1,700 jin per mu.

This year's summer harvest was not due to favorable weather conditions. From plowing to sowing, from sowing to greening, from greening to yellowing, from yellowing to threshing, from threshing to storage, a series of arduous struggles were undertaken. Before and after wheat sowing last year, there was a prolonged drought of 80-100 days, and over 100 million mu of wheat fields were sown after fighting the drought. In most areas, there was no thorough rain from sowing to harvest. Since the beginning of spring, there have been two or three instances of frost damage. Wheat rust, scab, and wheat midges were also relatively serious. Some places suffered from hail, wind, and rain damage (various places suffered a loss of about 10 billion jin due to disasters). Before wheat sowing last year, the high tide of agricultural production had not yet arrived. In addition to vigorously leading the masses to fight drought and rush sowing, only some areas focused on deep plowing, more fertilizer, good seeds, and close planting. Most areas were poorly prepared for production, with shallow plowing, insufficient base fertilizer, and rough sowing quality. The main reason for achieving a bumper harvest is that all localities, through the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, constantly overcame right-leaning conservative thinking, implemented the general line of building socialism, fully mobilized the masses, overcame natural disasters, and strengthened the later-stage management of wheat fields.

On the basis of vigorously developing water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation last winter and this spring, launching the "Three Flags Movement" (planting red, yellow, and blue flags according to the growth of wheat seedlings) and cultivating large areas of high-yield fields, resolutely eliminating third-class seedlings, was a crucial key to striving for a bumper wheat harvest this year. During the major stages of wheat overwintering, returning to green, jointing, and heading, irrigation, topdressing, frost prevention, seedling protection, and ditching and drainage were carried out relatively universally. In Hubei Province, 80% of the wheat fields were topdressed two to three times, and 10% of the wheat fields were topdressed more than three times, with fertilization reaching 20,000 to 30,000 jin per mu. Henan Province universally promoted the experience of "three fertilizers and five waters" (i.e., applying fertilizer three times and irrigating five times, and so on below). This year, many places adopted "five fertilizers and six waters," "six fertilizers and eight waters," or "seven fertilizers and seven waters." The two high-yield experimental mu of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Xiping County used six fertilizers and eight waters, with a fertilization amount of more than 150,000 jin per mu, 50 jin of ammonium sulfate, and 20 jin of superphosphate. In the past, people generally believed that there was no way to deal with wheat rust, scab, and lodging. This year, relying on the masses and adopting both indigenous and modern methods, large-scale prevention and control work was carried out, achieving remarkable results.

This year's wheat bumper harvest facts show that bumper harvests can be achieved regardless of plains, mountains, depressions, sandy land, saline-alkali land, regular cropping, or returning cropping.先天不足，后天加工仍大有可为.(This sentence is hard to directly translate while retaining the flavor of the original. Something like "Even with congenital deficiencies, much can still be achieved through postnatal processing." fits the context). If we start from scratch and do four things well (prepare well, sow well, manage well, and harvest well), the output will be much higher than it is now.

A dozen or so wheat high-yield "marshals have been promoted," hundreds of wheat high-yield "satellites have been launched," and the people of the whole country have been greatly liberated in their thinking. The "wait-and-see faction" and the "wait-until-after-the-autumn-harvest faction" have been rendered speechless. Conservative ideas such as "the theory of habit (skepticism)" and "the theory of conditions only" (output can only increase slowly) have also had to admit defeat in the face of the facts. Facts have proven that as long as we put forth the same effort in creating high wheat yields, any so-called "low-yield areas" and "low-yield crops" in the past can achieve high yields.

This year's summer harvest facts prove that there is great potential for increasing the yield of summer crops such as wheat. Developing wheat production and increasing the proportion of summer crops is a strategic measure for increasing agricultural production in the future. From now on, all localities should start formulating sowing plans and high-yield plans for next year's summer crops, complete autumn sowing in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of expanding irrigation, applying more base fertilizer, deep plowing, close planting, and popularizing good seeds, reform wheat field production tools, strengthen field management, irrigate, topdress, weed, and cultivate the soil in a timely manner according to the requirements of the crops, strive to overcome various disasters, and ensure a greater bumper harvest next summer.

    东风压倒西风的一个标志
    我国小麦总产量超过美国四十多亿斤
    夏粮总产量达一千多亿斤
    比去年增长百分之六十九
    新华社22日讯  中华人民共和国农业部1958年夏收粮食作物生产公报
    今年夏收粮食作物空前丰收。播种面积五万三千九百余万亩，总产量达到一千零一十亿斤，比1957年夏收粮食作物增产四百一十三亿斤，即增长69％，平均亩产一百八十七斤，比1957年增长70％。在夏收粮食作物中，冬小麦的播种面积三万五千六百余万亩，总产量达到六百八十九亿斤，比1957年增产二百七十九亿斤，增长68％。平均亩产一百九十三斤，比1957年增长71％。
    此外，全国四千五百万亩左右春小麦尚未收获，估计总产量约在九十亿斤左右。
    今年夏季丰收和产量增长的速度，是史无前例的。今年一季增产的数字，比1956年和1957年两年粮食增产总数还多二百多亿斤。今年夏收作物中的冬小麦增产数字比过去五年小麦增产总量多一倍还多。1949年我国小麦总产量仅及美国小麦总产量的44％，今年我国小麦总产量已经超过美国。按最近数字，我国冬小麦、春小麦合计总产量为七百七十九亿斤（未收春小麦以九十亿计），而据美国农业部7月10日的估计：美国今年的小麦产量为十三亿四千三百四十九万蒲式耳（每蒲式耳小麦为二十七点二二公斤），相当于七百三十一亿三千多万斤。其中冬小麦为十一亿二千九百七十二万七千蒲式耳，相当于六百一十五亿斤，春小麦二亿一千三百七十六万三千蒲式耳，相当于一百一十六亿三千多万斤。今年我国小麦产量至少超过美国小麦产量四十多亿斤。
    小麦高额丰产的县市：
    亩产达六百斤以上的有湖北的谷城县，河南的孟县。
    亩产五百斤以上的有河南的偃师、博爱、夏邑、西平、襄城、鲁山、商丘市、淅川、?县，河北的藁城，湖北的襄樊市等十一个县市。
    亩产达四百斤以上的有河南的洛阳市、通许、沈丘、长葛、温县、西峡、安阳、武陟、遂平、安阳市等县市，陕西的西安、汉中、咸阳市、长安、盩厔、高陵、鄠县等七个县市，河北的正定、石家庄市、邢台市、抚宁、安国等五个县市，湖北的襄阳、宜城二县，四川的郫县。
    亩产在三百斤以上的专区有五个：湖北的襄阳专区，河南的商丘、南阳、许昌等三个专区，河北的唐山专区。
      据山西、河北、山东、河南、陕西、江苏、安徽、湖北等省不完全统计，麦田亩产五百斤以上的面积有九百二十四万多亩。其中：亩产一千斤以上不足二千斤的有七十五万四千三百多亩。亩产二千斤以上不足三千斤的有四千二百三十六亩。亩产三千斤以上不足四千斤的有二百六十七点四七亩。亩产四千斤以上不足五千斤的有三十四亩。河南省西平县和平农业社社长陈颜理、第四队队长冯富耀二亩试验田平均亩产达七千三百二十斤，创1958年全国冬小麦最高丰产纪录。西平县猛进农业社社长刘大振、副社长李振华、九队队长刘令起为主的一亩七分多试验田亩产七千二百零一斤。湖北谷城县亩产五千斤以上的有八点七亩，其中新气象五社一点五亩试验田，亩产达五千四百六十七斤。山西解休县联福社一点零四亩大麦亩产五千七百零二斤，创造了1958年全国大麦最高丰产纪录。浙江淳安县建设社有五点二亩豌豆亩产二千零七十四斤，有六亩蚕豆亩产一千七百斤。
    今年夏季丰收，不是由于风调雨顺。从耕到播，从播到青，从青到黄，从黄到场，从场到仓，经过了一系列的艰苦斗争。去年小麦播种前后，遭受了八十——一百天长期干旱，有一亿多亩麦田是抗旱播种的。大部分地区，从播种到收获，一直没有下过透雨。入春以来，又遭受了两、三次霜冻灾害。小麦锈病赤霉病、吸浆虫也比较严重。有些地方遭受了雹灾、风灾、雨害（各地因灾少收粮食一百亿斤左右），去年小麦播种前，农业生产高潮还没有到来。各地除大力领导群众抗旱抢种外，只有部分地区抓了一下深耕、多肥、良种、密植，大部分地区生产准备较差，耕地不深，底肥不足，播种质量粗糙。获得丰收的主要原因，是各地经过全民整风和反右派斗争，不断的克服右倾保守思想，贯彻了建设社会主义的总路线，充分地发动了群众，战胜了自然灾害，加强了麦田的后期管理。
    在去冬今春大搞水利、积肥的基础上，展开三旗运动（按照麦苗生长情况分别插红旗、黄旗、蓝旗），培养大面积丰产田，坚决消灭三类苗，是争取今年小麦丰收的重要关键。在小麦越冬、返青、拔节、孕穗各个主要阶段，比较普遍地进行了灌溉、追肥、防冻、保苗及开沟排水等工作。湖北省有80％的麦田追肥二次到三次，有10％的麦田追肥三次以上，施肥每亩达二万至三万斤。河南省普遍地推广了“三肥五水”（即施三次肥、灌五次水，下仿此）的经验，今年不少地方采用“五肥六水”，“六肥八水”或“七肥七水”。西平县和平农业社二亩丰产试验田就是六肥八水，施肥量达每亩十五万多斤、硫酸铵五十斤、过磷酸钙二十斤。过去一般人认为对小麦锈病、赤霉病以及倒伏是没有办法的，今年依靠群众“土洋并举”，开展大规模防治工作，收到显著效果。
    今年小麦丰产事实说明：不论平原、山区、洼地、沙地、碱地、正茬、回茬都可获得丰收。先天不足，后天加工仍大有可为。如果从头干起，做到四好（准备好、播得好、管理好、收得好），产量比现在还要高得多。
    十几个小麦丰产“元帅升帐”，几百个小麦丰产“卫星上天”，全国人民思想大解放，“观潮派”“秋后算账派”哑口无言。“习惯论（怀疑论）”“唯条件论”（增产只能慢慢的来）等保守思想也在事实面前，不得不认输。事实证明，只要拿出创造小麦高额丰产的干劲，任何过去所谓“低产的地区”和“低产的作物”都可以获得高额丰产。
    今年夏季丰收事实证明，小麦等夏收作物增产潜力很大，发展麦类生产，提高夏收作物比重，是今后农业增产一项具有战略性的措施。各地从现在起，即应着手制订明年夏收作物的播种计划和丰产规划，按照扩大灌溉、多施底肥、深耕、密植、普及良种等项要求，及时完成秋播，改革麦田生产工具，加强田间管理，按照作物要求及时浇水、追肥、锄草、培土，努力战胜各种灾害，保证明年夏季获得更大丰收。
