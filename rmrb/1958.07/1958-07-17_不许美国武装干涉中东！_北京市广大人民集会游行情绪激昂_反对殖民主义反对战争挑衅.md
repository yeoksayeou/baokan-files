The outrageous invasion of Lebanon by U.S. imperialism has aroused the anger of the broad masses of people in Beijing. Tonight, tens of thousands of workers, peasants, professors, students, government cadres, and street residents gathered overnight to express their firm support for the Lebanese people's uprising and the establishment of the Iraqi revolutionary government, and to resolutely demand that U.S. troops get out of Lebanon and not interfere in the Middle East!

The employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held separate gatherings tonight to denounce U.S. imperialist armed intervention in Lebanon and support Iraq's struggle for national independence. The steelworkers, having just finished smelting a furnace of iron, held a meeting in front of the blast furnace, where they angrily condemned the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism. Li Guochen, a furnace worker, said that the Iraqi people's overthrow of the heinous reactionary dynasty was not only a victory for the Iraqi people but also a victory for peace-loving people all over the world. We Chinese steelworkers resolutely oppose the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism, and we firmly support the struggle of the Lebanese and Iraqi people against imperialism. Yang Xuefang, another furnace worker, pointed out indignantly that the Chinese people, who had suffered from imperialist oppression in the past, have now stood up, and we will never allow U.S. imperialism to run rampant. Imperialist aggression will surely be met with a bloody nose in the face of the just struggle of the people of the world.

More than 3,000 workers from the Beijing Cotton Textile United Factory held a mass meeting after getting off the night shift and marched on the streets in demonstration overnight. At the mass meeting, Zhao Quanlin, deputy secretary of the factory's Party committee, told the workers, "The American aggressors cannot scare the Lebanese and Iraqi people who are striving for independence; peace-loving people all over the world are their backing!" As soon as he finished speaking, the workers, with incomparable anger, scrambled to speak at the meeting. Tian Linsheng, a worker in the electrical workshop, said, "As a member of the Chinese working class, I resolutely oppose this jackal behavior of U.S. imperialism." He shouted, "U.S. troops get out of Lebanon!"

The workers of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, who were on the night shift, gathered next to the machines in the workshop during their break to hold a meeting. Worker Wang Weisheng warned U.S. imperialism, "The struggle of the Lebanese and Iraqi people is not isolated; they will receive the support of 600 million Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world. If U.S. imperialists do not abandon their aggressive ambitions, they will surely suffer a shameful defeat in the face of the just struggle of the world's people, just as they did on the Korean battlefield."

University students and professors were in high spirits tonight. At a rally held tonight at Peking University by more than 10,000 faculty and students to protest U.S. imperialist interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries, they constantly raised their angry fists and shouted in Chinese and Arabic: "Oppose U.S. armed aggression against Lebanon!" "We support the Lebanese people's uprising!" "Support the Iraqi revolutionary government!" Li Jin, vice chairman of the Peking University Trade Union, Jian Bozan, director of the History Department, Shen Mengren, an Arabic major student, Ma Jian, director of the Arabic Language Teaching and Research Section of the Department of Eastern Languages, Wang Jiajun, vice chairman of the Student Union, and Lu Ping, first secretary of the Peking University Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting one after another. They unanimously pointed out that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, a setting sun, and in today's situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the people will not allow imperialism to run wild. Imperialism is bound to fail. Ma Jian said, "The 600 million Chinese people, including China's 10 million Muslims, express their heartfelt congratulations to the Iraqi people and all the Arab people!" Shen Mengren said, "We want to solemnly warn the U.S. imperialists that those who play with fire will get burned! We will never tolerate the U.S. imperialists' blatant interference in the Lebanese people's affairs; the aggressors will surely suffer the consequences." More than 10,000 faculty and students from Tsinghua University also held a gathering. Jiang Nanxiang, the president of the university, said at the meeting that the victory of the Iraqi people is another glorious confirmation that the East wind prevails over the West wind. This is an event of great international significance. Jiang Nanxiang said that the U.S. invasion of Lebanon is completely unreasonable. UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld has already confirmed that there is no so-called "large-scale infiltration" in Lebanon, and the Lebanese issue is an internal affair. Jiang Nanxiang pointed out that the U.S. excuse of protecting expatriates and so-called stopping "foreign indirect aggression" is completely fabricated. This act of aggression shows that the United States is a blatant violator of the UN Charter. After Student Union Chairman Tan Haoqiang and Trade Union Vice Chairman Professor Zhong Shimo spoke at the meeting, the faculty and students shouted, "Oppose colonialism!" "Long live national liberation!" After learning the news that the U.S. aggressors had armed intervention in Lebanon, all the faculty and students of Beijing Normal University called and wrote letters to the school authorities, demanding a gathering to protest the barbaric behavior of U.S. imperialism. At tonight's meeting, people crowded the venue, and the streets were also full of people. The sound of their slogans resounded through the clouds. More than ten people, including the chairman of the Student Union, the secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee, and student representatives, spoke at the meeting. Guan Jiaren, a student in the Department of Mathematics who lost his right arm in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, said angrily at the meeting that peace was bought with blood. I personally witnessed the failure of U.S. imperialism on the Korean battlefield. If U.S. imperialism does not quickly roll back from Lebanon this time, it will also be defeated in the face of peaceful people. Finally, he raised his only arm and shouted, "Long live peace." His words made the people present even more excited, and many people jumped up and shouted slogans such as "Defend peace" and "Long live peace." Tonight, faculty and students from more than 30 universities in Beijing held rallies to support Iraq and Lebanon and oppose U.S. aggression.

In the auditorium of the Heping Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs, more than 160 members gathered tonight, unanimously expressing their support for the establishment of the Iraqi revolutionary government and the just struggle of the Lebanese people, and expressing their firm opposition to the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialists. The members immediately wrote a congratulatory letter to the Iraqi people, congratulating them on their independence. More than 1,000 members of the Jinxing Agricultural Production Cooperative also held gatherings in more than 20 places. More than 1,000 street residents of Chunshu Hutong held gatherings in four places. The residents unanimously supported the Lebanese and Iraqi people who are striving for and defending national independence, and demanded that the armed forces of U.S. imperialism withdraw from Lebanon immediately.

The people of Beijing could not calm down for a long time tonight. Many people rushed to write propaganda slogans and protest letters overnight. They proposed that we must resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism, and peace can only be achieved through struggle. (Photos attached)

    北京市广大人民集会游行情绪激昂
    反对殖民主义反对战争挑衅
    新华社16日讯　美国帝国主义悍然侵略黎巴嫩，激起了北京市广大人民的愤怒。今天晚间，有十几万工人、农民、教授、学生、机关干部和街道居民连夜集会表示坚决声援黎巴嫩人民的起义和伊拉克革命政府的成立，坚决要求美国军队滚出黎巴嫩，不准干涉中东！
    石景山钢铁厂的职工，今天晚上，分别集会，声讨美帝国主义对黎巴嫩的武装干涉，支持伊拉克的民族独立斗争。炼铁工人们刚炼完一炉铁，他们就在高炉前面举行了集会，工人们愤怒地谴责美帝国主义的侵略行为。炉前工李国臣说，伊拉克人民把万恶的反动王朝推翻了，这不仅是伊拉克人民的胜利，也是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利。我们中国钢铁工人坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略行为，我们坚决支援黎巴嫩和伊拉克人民反对帝国主义的斗争。炉前工杨学芳愤慨地指出，过去受过帝国主义压迫的中国人民，现在站起来了，我们决不容许美帝国主义横行霸道，帝国主义的侵略行为一定会在全世界人民的正义斗争面前碰得头破血流。
    北京棉纺织联合厂有三千多工人，刚下了晚班便举行大会，并连夜结队到街上游行示威。在群众大会上，这个厂的党委副书记赵全林对工人们说：“美国侵略者是吓不倒争取独立的黎巴嫩和伊拉克人民的，全世界爱好和平的人民都是他们的后盾！”他的话刚刚讲完，工人们以无比愤怒的心情争先在大会上发言。电气车间工人田林生说：“我作为中国工人阶级的成员，坚决反对美帝国主义这种豺狼行为。”他高呼“美国军队滚出黎巴嫩！”
    北京电子管厂上夜班的工人们，在休息的时间内聚集在车间的机器旁举行了集会。工人汪伟生警告美帝国主义说：“黎巴嫩和伊拉克人民的斗争不是孤立的，他们会得到六亿中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持，美帝国主义者如不放弃他的侵略野心，必会像在朝鲜战场一样，最后遭到可耻的失败。”
    大学生和教授们今晚情绪非常激昂。北京大学一万多名师生在今夜举行的抗议美帝国主义干涉阿拉伯各国人民内政大会上，不断举起愤怒的拳头，用汉语和阿拉伯语振臂高呼：“反对美国武装侵略黎巴嫩！”“我们声援黎巴嫩人民的起义！”“声援伊拉克革命政府！”北京大学工会副主席李今、历史系主任翦伯赞、阿拉伯语专业学生沈孟仁、东语系阿拉伯语教研室主任马坚、学生会副主席王家俊、中共北京大学委员会第一书记陆平，先后在会上讲了话。他们一致指出，美帝国主义是纸老虎，是傍晚的落日，在今天全世界东风压倒西风的形势下，人民是不容许帝国主义逞凶的。帝国主义一定遭到失败。马坚说：“中国六亿人民，包括中国的一千万穆斯林，对伊拉克人民和所有的阿拉伯人民，表示衷心祝贺！”沈孟仁说：“我们要严正地警告美帝国主义者，玩火者自焚！我们决不能容忍美帝国主义者对黎巴嫩人民的粗暴干涉，侵略者必将自食其果。”清华大学也有一万多名师生举行了集会，这个学校的校长蒋南翔在会上说，伊拉克人民的胜利，是东风压倒西风又一次光辉的证实。这是具有重大的国际意义的事件。蒋南翔说，美国侵略黎巴嫩是毫无道理的，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德已经证实，黎巴嫩并不存在所谓“大规模渗透”的情况，黎巴嫩的问题是内政问题。蒋南翔指出，美国借口保护侨民和所谓制止“外来间接侵略”完全是捏造。这种侵略行为表明美国是联合国宪章公然的破坏者。在学生会主席谭浩强、工会副主席锺士模教授在会上发言以后，全场师生高呼：“反对殖民主义！”“民族解放万岁！”北京师范大学全体师生得悉美国侵略者武装干涉黎巴嫩的消息后，纷纷打电话和写信给校方要求集会抗议美帝国主义的野蛮行为。在今晚的大会上，人们挤满了会场，马路上也站满了人。他们高呼的口号声响彻云霄。在会上发言的有学生会主席、共青团委书记、学生代表等十多人。数学系学生管甲仁在抗美援朝战争中失去右臂，他在会上愤怒地说，和平是用鲜血换来的，我在朝鲜战场上亲眼看到了美帝国主义的失败，美帝国主义这一次的野蛮行动，如果不从黎巴嫩迅速滚回去，也会在和平人民的面前遭到失败。最后他举起独臂高呼“和平万岁”。他的话使到会的人更加激动，许多人都跳起来高呼“保卫和平”、“和平万岁”的口号。今晚北京三十多个高等学校的师生都分别举行了声援伊拉克、黎巴嫩反对美国侵略的集会。
