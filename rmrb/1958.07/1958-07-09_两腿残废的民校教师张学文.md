    Zhang Xuewen is a comrade who is paralyzed in both legs. He is from Liuhao Township, Haimen County, Jiangsu Province. After graduating from senior primary school in 1952, he participated in literacy work and has now eliminated illiteracy for twenty-three people and semi-illiteracy for seventeen.

    For five years, Zhang Xuewen has overcome the difficulties of his physical disabilities with strong perseverance and insisted on working. His home is more than two *li* from the community-run school. When classes are held, the students or community-run school teachers pick him up and drop him off by cart. One night, he fell into a ditch and was covered in mud. When he went home to change clothes, his mother advised him not to go. Thinking of the dozens of students waiting for him to teach, he still insisted on going to class. Another time, it rained heavily after class, and he couldn't get home, so he stayed at the school overnight. He is also very responsible in teaching, often exchanging teaching experiences with other community-run school teachers, checking teaching quality, and improving teaching methods. He also mobilized thirty-five educated youth to participate in literacy work.

    Because Zhang Xuewen can actively serve the masses, he is loved by the broad masses. The masses often push him in a cart to see movies or visit relatives and friends. In the past five years, he has been named a model community-run school teacher and an activist in the district's literacy campaign eight times and has been praised by the District Communist Youth League Committee.

    两腿残废的民校教师张学文
    有一个两腿残废的同志，他是江苏省海门县刘浩乡人，名叫张学文。他于1952年高小毕业后就参加了扫盲工作，现在已扫除了二十三个文盲和十七个半文盲。
    五年来，张学文以坚强的毅力，克服了生理缺陷的困难，坚持工作。他家离民校二里多路，上课时，都是学员或民校教师用车子接送。一天晚上，他跌在沟里，浑身沾满泥水，回家换衣服时，他母亲劝他不要去了，他想到几十个学员在等着他教课，仍坚持去上了课。还有一次，下课时天下大雨，他无法回家，就在校里呆了一夜。在教学上，他也是非常负责的，经常和民校教师一起交流教学经验，检查教学质量，改进教学方法。他还动员了三十五个知识青年参加扫盲工作。
    由于张学文能积极为群众服务，得到广大群众的热爱。群众经常用车子推着他去看电影或拜亲访友。五年多来，他先后八次被评为模范民校教师、区扫盲积极分子，并得到团区委的表扬。
