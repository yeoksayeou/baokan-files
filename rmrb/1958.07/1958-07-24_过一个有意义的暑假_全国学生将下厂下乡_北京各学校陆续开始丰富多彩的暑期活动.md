Have a Meaningful Summer Vacation
Students Across the Country Will Go to Factories and the Countryside
Beijing Schools Launch Diverse Summer Activities

    (Reported by this newspaper) This year, students across the country will have a meaningful and diverse summer vacation. A vacation activity centered on going to factories and the countryside for labor and promoting the General Line has already begun or is about to begin.

    Before the summer vacation, educational administrative organs and Communist Youth League organizations in various regions have already made plans and arrangements. In order to implement the policy of combining education with politics and education with productive labor, various regions will organize and lead students to actively participate in socialist construction and the mass struggle during the summer vacation. At the same time, there will be other meaningful activities.

    This summer, various regions are organizing large numbers of students to go to factories and the countryside, to eat, live, and work alongside workers and peasants, to transform their thinking, support industrial and agricultural production, and promote the technological revolution and cultural revolution. In Shandong Province, many students from major universities and middle schools will participate in production labor or farming in the factories within the schools during the summer vacation, and some students will participate in industrial and agricultural production outside the schools. More than 5,000 students in Jinan City are participating in activities to support factory construction; students in rural areas are mainly participating in agricultural labor. Many students have already participated in local General Line propaganda, literacy campaigns, popularizing Mandarin Chinese, and helping to run agricultural middle schools. University and middle school students in Shaanxi Province will also participate in productive labor and public welfare labor during the vacation. Beijing, Liaoning, Wuhan and other regions will organize large numbers of university students to help newly built small factories install machines and solve technical problems. In the Shangrao area of Jiangxi Province, 200,000 primary and secondary school students will participate in the rush to harvest and plant crops, promote the General Line, and conduct literacy campaigns. In Guangning County, Guangdong Province, more than 40,000 primary and secondary school students and teachers have already gone to the countryside to participate in the summer harvest and planting, and they will work for a month. University and middle school students in Tianjin are preparing to participate in the project to thoroughly harness the Hai River.

    Under the call of "Everyone studies the General Line, everyone promotes the General Line," many schools, under the leadership of the local Party and government, will adopt diverse forms such as folk songs, clapper talks, poems, paintings, and small performances to conduct propaganda in factories, mines, rural areas, and streets. Currently, many schools have already begun studying documents related to the General Line and rehearsing programs.

    While participating in productive labor in factories and the countryside, students in schools across the country will also actively participate in the literacy movement and help carry out cultural and recreational activities.

    (Reported by this newspaper) The unusual summer vacation life of university, middle, and primary school students in the capital has gradually begun. This summer vacation, students in various schools will carry out various work-study activities and voluntary labor; participate in military camping and cultural and sports activities.

    Some university students in the capital are still taking exams, while others have already begun their summer life, which is mainly focused on running factories in a big way and participating in physical labor. The campus of the Renmin University of China is like a bustling construction site, with many teachers and students working day and night to build an artificial lake of 5,800 square meters. Most students are working hard in more than 100 factories that have just been built, such as paper mills, fertilizer plants, printing plants, and air battery plants. Some students at the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology are digging earth and laying foundations for newly built dormitories and libraries. Some students are smelting iron and manufacturing firebricks. After all first- and second-year students have completed their exams, the entire institute will invest in the construction of a metallurgical joint enterprise with an annual output of 100,000 tons of steel. More than 1,000 second-year students from the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, together with senior students, have gone to Xinjiang, Sichuan, and Hubei to conduct geological surveys and exploration work. Most students at Tsinghua University will participate in work-study factory construction labor, and some students are preparing to go to Dengfeng and other counties in Henan to help local areas build small power stations, or to travel and visit the Northeast.

    More than 650,000 middle and primary school students began their happy summer vacation life on the 17th and 13th, respectively. On the 22nd, 1,200 middle school students went to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to participate in the voluntary labor for the plant's expansion project. The labor army of more than 40,000 people in the Dongcheng District participated in the lake-digging labor. The Xicheng District organized a greening army of 2,400 people to plant trees in Xiangshan, where they will plant 200,000 saplings on 500 mu of land. In the first few days of the vacation, some teachers and students from Beijing No. 2 Middle School and No. 22 Middle School started industries from scratch. The iron-melting furnace of No. 2 Middle School has already melted iron, and No. 22 Middle School successfully trial-produced hydrochloric acid on the evening of the 21st, and began production on the 22nd. In addition, some students have gone to agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs to participate in agricultural production labor. Starting on the 21st, some middle school students have begun a one- to seven-day military camping life, where they will go to the驻地 [zhù dì - military base] of artillery, infantry, tank, and air force units to learn military knowledge. Some students will also participate in training in sampans, parachuting, model airplane making, and radio technology. Middle school students in Haidian District held a literary and art performance on the 20th.

    This year's summer life for primary school students is also rich and colorful. Primary school students will visit factories and agricultural production cooperatives during the vacation. Recently, some primary school students visited the Beijing Automobile Factory, listened to the worker uncles introduce the situation of the Great Leap Forward, and also participated in the factory's brick-carrying labor. Chongwen District established a children's joint enterprise, where primary school students make chalk and ink themselves. Summer camps located in the scenic hot springs and Xiangshan have already begun. Currently, 27 children's parks in urban and suburban areas have begun activities.
