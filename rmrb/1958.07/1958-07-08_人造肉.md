    Artificial Meat
    The Beijing Bacterial Fertilizer Factory has recently successfully trial-produced "artificial meat."

    “Artificial meat” looks like “chocolate” candy. It can be used in soup and has a meat-like fragrance. “Artificial meat” contains 3% fat and 50% protein, and also contains vitamin B. It is made by cultivating an edible yeast from the pentose contained in straw and discarded vegetable leaves, and then processing it. "Artificial meat" can compensate for nutritional deficiencies and is also very beneficial for the treatment of beriberi and chondropathy.

    人造肉
    北京市细菌肥料厂最近试制成功了“人造肉”。
    人造肉”好像“巧克力”糖。可以冲汤食用，有一股肉的香味。“人造肉”含有3％的脂肪和50％的蛋白质，还含有维生素乙。它是把稻草中所含的五碳糖和废弃的菜叶培植成一种食用酵母，然后经过一番处理而制成的。“人造肉”可以弥补身体营养不足，并且对治疗脚气病和软骨病也有很大好处。
