Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 7th: "Mobilize a million athletes to participate in the selection process and strive for the top two positions in total scores at next year's National Games." This is the action slogan put forward by Guangdong Province in sports.

Since the National Sports Conference, mass sports activities in Guangdong Province, especially rural sports activities, have greatly developed. Puning, Zhongshan, Guangning and other counties have basically achieved that every agricultural cooperative has a sports association and carried out various activities. Counties and cities throughout the province are rapidly building sports venues and establishing various sports teams.

Guangdong Province is preparing to develop the number of team members above the county and city level to 5,000 before the first National Games; to develop youth and juvenile sports schools to 3,000; and to mobilize 10 million people, mainly in rural areas, to participate in sports activities. On this basis, a wide selection process involving more than one million people will be carried out from rural areas, factories, mines, schools, government offices, and enterprises up to the province level, to form a provincial team to participate in the National Games. At present, the Preparatory Committee for the First National Games of Guangdong Province has been established. Chen Yu, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Guangdong Province, serves as the chairman of the committee.

    广东群众性体育活动蓬勃展开
    据新华社广州7日电  “发动百万健儿参加选拔，力争明年全运总分前两名”。这是广东省在体育运动方面提出的行动口号。
    自从全国体育运动会议之后，广东省群众性体育活动，特别是农村体育活动已有很大发展。普宁、中山、广宁等县基本上已经做到每个农业社都有体育协会，展开了多种活动。全省各县、市正在迅速地兴建体育场地和建立各种运动队。
    广东省准备在明年第一届中国人民体育运动大会以前，把县、市以上代表队队员发展到五千名；青、少年体育学校发展到三千所；以农村为主，发动一千万人参加体育活动。在这个基础上，农村、厂矿、学校、机关、企业直到省，开展一次有一百万人以上参加的广泛选拔，组成省代表队参加全运。现在，广东省参加第一届中国人民体育运动大会筹委会已经成立。中共广东省委书记、广东省省长陈郁担任主任委员。
