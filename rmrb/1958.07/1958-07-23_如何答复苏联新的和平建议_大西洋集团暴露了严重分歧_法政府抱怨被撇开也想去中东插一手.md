Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd, Paris Dispatch: Yesterday, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Permanent Council met to discuss how to respond to the Soviet Union's proposal for a five-nation summit to discuss the Middle East situation. The meeting once again exposed the serious divisions within this group.

According to Western news agencies, during the three-hour discussion, the representatives spoke out of turn, each promoting their own country's position. Some urged that the West should give a positive reply to the Soviet proposal; some believed that the Soviet proposal should be accepted "perhaps under certain conditions"; and some argued that a summit should not be held now, but should be "postponed for a while."

It is said that Norway and Sweden, which are not members of the group, are inclined to accept the Soviet proposal. The United States and Britain, however, stubbornly insisted that the Middle East issue is currently being handled by the United Nations and insisted on resolving the issue within the so-called United Nations framework. They also emphasized that the meeting should have so-called "full preparation," attempting to play delaying tactics. Although Denmark agreed to resolve the Middle East issue through the United Nations, it also believed that a solution to the Middle East issue should not be ruled out outside the United Nations framework. Even France was not as insistent as the United States and Britain.

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st, London Dispatch: According to the "Sunday Times" on July 20th, the French government is deeply dissatisfied with the US and British practice of bypassing France and carrying out armed intervention in the Middle East. It has instructed its ambassadors in London and Washington to raise "opinions" on this matter to the United States and Britain, pointing out France's "status" in the region and reminding them of the necessity of joint action with France in the current situation.

The newspaper said that France complained that the United States did not "consult" with France before taking armed intervention actions in Lebanon. The French side emphasized that "Lebanon has close economic and cultural ties with France; Lebanon's currency is guaranteed by the Bank of France."

A statement by a French government spokesperson quoted by the newspaper proves that France is eager to intervene in the Middle East. The spokesperson said that France insists that the three countries should jointly study the issues related to the Middle East situation and exchange opinions with each other.

    如何答复苏联新的和平建议
    大西洋集团暴露了严重分歧
    法政府抱怨被撇开也想去中东插一手
    新华社22日讯  巴黎消息：昨天北大西洋集团常任理事会开会讨论如何答复苏联关于举行五国政府首脑会议讨论中东局势的建议。会上再一次暴露了这个集团的严重分歧。
    据西方通讯社透露在长达三小时的讨论中，代表们七嘴八舌地各人说一套自己国家的主张。有的人敦促说，西方应该给苏联的建议以肯定的答复；有的人认为，“也许应该在某种条件下”接受苏联的建议；还有一些人主张，现在不要举行政府首脑会议，而应该“过些时候再说”。
    据说，挪威和不属于这个集团的瑞典都倾向于接受苏联的建议。美国和英国却硬说中东问题目前正在由联合国处理中，坚持要在所谓联合国范围内解决这个问题。它们还强调会议要有所谓“充分准备”，企图玩弄拖延策略。丹麦虽然赞成通过联合国解决中东问题，但是又认为不应该排斥在联合国范围以外寻求中东问题的解决方法。就是法国，也不像美英两国那样坚持非这样那样不可。
    新华社21日讯  伦敦消息：据“星期日泰晤士”报20日报道，法国政府对于美英撇开法国在中东进行武装干涉的做法深为不满。它已经训令它驻伦敦和华盛顿的大使就这件事向美英两国提出“意见”，并且指明法国在这一地区的“地位”以及提醒它们注意在目前情况下同法国联合行动的必要性。
    报纸说，法国抱怨美国在黎巴嫩采取武装干涉行动之前不曾同法国“商量”。法国方面强调指出“黎巴嫩在经济和文化上同法国有密切联系；黎巴嫩的通货就是由法兰西银行来担保的。”
    报纸引的法国政府一个发言人的谈话，证明法国极想插手对中东的干涉。这个发言人说，法国坚持认为，三国应该共同研究有关中东局势的问题，并且互相交换意见。
