    Thanks to Our Mongolian Brothers
    On the afternoon of June 21st, another comrade and I went to Chifeng County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, on official business. We departed from Errentun, Yuanbaoshan, Chifeng County, heading towards Taiping Township. En route, we were stopped by the "Xilu Gaya River." This river was more than half a kilometer wide with a very rapid current. Unable to find any means to cross, and due to the urgency of our task, I decided to scout the way first. When I reached the center of the river, I was suddenly knocked down by the current and swept more than a kilometer downstream. The comrade on the shore was frantic and shouted for help. Not far from the riverbank, two Mongolian farmers were tilling the land. Hearing the shouts, they immediately dropped their hoes and rescued me from the river. Seeing that I was unconscious and bleeding profusely, they quickly carried me across the river to the production cooperative's brigade headquarters. The brigade leader, seeing my serious condition, immediately sent for a doctor, boiled water to wash off the mud, and provided bedding. After a night's rest, I recovered and we were able to begin our work. When we were about to return after completing our task, the brigade leader sent two farmers to help us cross the river. They ferried us back and forth across the river seven or eight times. Thanks to their help, we completed the task assigned to us by the Party on time. We are truly grateful to these Mongolian brothers.

    感谢蒙族兄弟
    6月21日下午，我和另外一位同志，因公去内蒙古自治区赤峰县。我们从赤峰县元宝山二人屯出发，前往太平乡。中途被“西路嘎牙河”拦住去路，这条河有一里多宽，水流很急，当时找不到过河的工具，因工作任务紧急，不能耽搁，由我先去探路。当走到河中心，忽然被水冲倒，一下冲出两里多远，岸上那位同志急得到处喊人搭救。河边不远的地方正有两个蒙族农民铲地，他们听到喊声，马上扔下锄头，把我打捞上岸。他们看我失去知觉，全身鲜血直流，急忙背我过河，送到生产合作社大队部。队长看我情况严重，一面派人去找医生，一面烧水给我洗身上的污泥，还借来被子和褥子。睡了一夜，第二天恢复正常，就开始工作。当我们完成工作任务要回去时，队长同志又派两位农民把我们送过河，他们为我们来来回回过了七、八次河。由于他们的帮助，使我们按时完成了党交给的任务。我们真感谢这些蒙族兄弟。
