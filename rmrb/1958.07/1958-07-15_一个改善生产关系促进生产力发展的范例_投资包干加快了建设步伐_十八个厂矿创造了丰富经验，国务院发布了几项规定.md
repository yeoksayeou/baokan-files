    Xinhua News Agency, July 14th Report: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Shen reported: The on-site meeting on delegating basic construction investment jointly convened by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Finance at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant pointed out that the method of delegating basic construction investment to construction units for contract use is the direction of the basic construction management system. It can enable the Party's mass line to be fully implemented in basic construction, enable basic construction to better implement the general line of building socialism, and also implement and consolidate the economic accounting system on the broadest mass base.

    This meeting was held from the 6th to the 10th. Representatives from twenty-six factories and mining enterprises in the metallurgical industry system and representatives from more than two hundred branches, sub-branches, and offices of the People's Construction Bank of China participated in the meeting. Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian and Vice Minister of Finance Jin Ming spoke at the meeting.

    Over the past four months, the investment contract system has been implemented in eighteen factories and mines across the country. These construction units have brought their initiative into play, fully tapped their potential, and actively responded to the call of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to "double investment, double output, and double speed." Various units have universally adopted measures to cut (cut unnecessary facilities), postpone (postpone construction that is not urgently needed), reduce (reduce standards for non-productive facilities), increase (tap and increase production capacity), and build (manufacture equipment themselves as much as possible) to increase production and save resources. Alternatively, they have implemented a combination of large, medium, and small methods within the enterprise, using the remaining materials and waste from the construction of large blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces to build small blast furnaces and small converters on a large scale. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel plan to build a number of small and medium-sized blast furnaces and converters this year, and Wuhan Iron and Steel will build small mines using the method of "laying eggs from large mines." So far, six of the eighteen units under the investment contract of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have met the requirements of "doubling investment," and some have reached "one doubling to three."

    The units implementing the investment contract system have universally broken the past situation of "multiple masters for one thing" in basic construction and the "separation of four powers" among construction, construction, design, and appropriation units, and changed to a method of unified leadership by one institution, thus transforming the past state of mutual wrangling into a unified whole of mutual collaboration. The construction period of each unit has been repeatedly shortened. For example, the completion time of the expansion projects of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant will be greatly advanced.

    When implementing the investment contract system, each construction unit implemented a layer-by-layer contract system within the enterprise, further combining the investment contract with the production activities of the broad masses of workers. Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant implemented a four-stage contract from the plant to the engineering department, section, and team, contracting the investment, progress, quotas, and quality of the project to the team. Workers participated in production management and launched a "multi-faceted" movement of mixed work types. In this way, the complicated basic construction undertaking was handed over to the workers in a led and planned manner, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses and further promoted leaders to consult with the masses to solve problems.

    The implementation of investment contracts is a fundamental change in the basic construction financial management system. Many units of the People's Construction Bank of China have broken down old conventions and established new ones, changing their past relationship of simply emphasizing supervision of construction units to a relationship of supporting and collaborating, and working together to serve production and construction. After research by the Beijing Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the three sets of books were changed to one set of books, greatly simplifying appropriation procedures, reducing reports, and improving efficiency. Relevant units of the Construction Bank also moved to the plant to work, delivering funds to the door and providing on-site services. In the past, "money for cooking oil was not allowed to buy vinegar," but now, as long as it is within the investment limit, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant unifies its use. This approach has been warmly welcomed by the plant's employees.

    Vice Premier Li Xiannian spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the investment contract system is a direction for China's basic construction management system and a bright red flag. It is fully in line with the general policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. He said: Investment contracting is the most led and the most widely mass-based economic accounting system, which is both a political and an economic accounting system, and is both a controlled and a flexible accounting system. It is wrong for some people to think that the implementation of investment contracts will affect the economic accounting system.

    Vice Premier Li also pointed out that the investment contract system is also a change in the relations of production, which changes the relationship between superiors and subordinates, between enterprises, and between people. The essence of investment contracting is to rely on the Party committee, mobilize the masses, and delegate power and responsibility. Such a change in the relations of production is conducive to promoting the development of productive forces and greatly accelerating the speed of construction.

    Finally, Vice Premier Li said: The new system of investment contracting combines the wishes of the state with the wishes of the masses, and combines the leadership of the Party with the enthusiasm of the masses. If the masses give full play to their enthusiasm, they will create miracles.

    Xinhua News Agency, July 14th News: The "Several Provisions of the State Council on Improving the Financial Management System of Basic Construction," which was adopted at the 78th plenary meeting of the State Council held on July 5, has been issued to various places for implementation. This regulation passed by the State Council is a new direction for the financial management of basic construction and a revolutionary measure taken to carry out basic construction with greater, faster, better and more economical results. The main spirit of this regulation is to give full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of various economic departments and construction units, and encourage them to improve management, be careful in calculations, and do more with the same amount of money within the established investment amount. And it is necessary to rely on the Party and the masses to supervise the rational use of funds, so as to promote the high-speed development of construction undertakings.

    The main points of this regulation are: (1) The basic construction investment (including basic construction workload and reserve funds) determined by the annual national economic plan and the state budget shall be handed over to the relevant construction departments and units, unified control, self-arrangement, and contracted use on the condition that the production capacity is not reduced, the completion date is not postponed, the total investment amount is not exceeded, and the proportion of non-productive construction is not increased. (2) Construction departments and construction units have the right to modify design quotas and adjust construction projects according to local conditions and specific circumstances within the scope of the determined total investment amount, and to adjust and use funds among various projects. After the original construction project is completed, if there is a surplus of funds, it can still be retained by the construction department and the construction unit for other uses (mainly used for production and construction). The more reasonable the use of funds by the construction department and the construction unit, and the more savings, the larger the scale of basic construction can be carried out. (3) For basic construction in various departments and units, at the end of the year, when the project is not completed and there is a surplus of investment, these funds will be carried over to the next year for continued use, and the method of recovering them at the end of the year will no longer be adopted. In addition, this regulation also makes new provisions on the work of financial departments in allocating basic construction funds in the future and the establishment of basic construction appropriation agencies.

    一个改善生产关系促进生产力发展的范例
    投资包干加快了建设步伐
    十八个厂矿创造了丰富经验，国务院发布了几项规定
    据新华社14日讯　新华社记者赵慎应报道：由冶金工业部和财政部在石景山钢铁厂联合召开的基本建设投资下放的现场会议指出，把基本建设投资下放到建设单位包干使用的办法，是基本建设管理制度的方向，它能够使党的群众路线在基本建设中得到全面贯彻，能够使基本建设更好地贯彻建设社会主义的总路线，还能够在最广泛的群众基础上贯彻和巩固经济核算制度。
    这个会议是6日到10日举行的。冶金工业系统的二十六个厂矿企业的代表和中国人民建设银行的二百多个分行、支行、办事处的代表，参加了这个会议。国务院副总理李先念和财政部副部长金明在会上讲了话。
    四个月来，投资包干制已经在全国十八个厂矿中推行，这些建设单位发挥了积极性，充分挖掘潜力，积极响应冶金部提出的“投资一顶二、产量翻一番、速度快一倍”的号召。各单位普遍采取了砍（砍掉不太必要的设施）、缓（不急需的缓建）、降（降低非生产性设施标准）、增（挖掘和增加生产能力）、造（自己尽可能地制造设备）等增产节约措施，或者在企业内部实行大、中、小相结合的办法，利用建设大型高炉平炉剩下的材料和废料，大建小高炉小转炉。如鞍钢和包钢就计划今年要建设一批中小型高炉和转炉，武钢将用大矿山下蛋的办法建设小矿山。到目前为止，冶金部投资包干的十八个单位，已有六个单位达到了“投资一顶二”的要求，有的达到了“一顶三”。
    执行投资包干的各单位，普遍地打破了过去基本建设上“一事多主”和建设、施工、设计、拨款单位“四权分立”的局面，改为由一个机构实行统一领导的办法，从而变过去多方扯皮的状态为互相协作的统一整体。各单位的建设工期一再提前。如石景山钢铁厂和太原钢铁厂的扩建工程，完工时间都将大大地提前。
    各建设单位在执行投资包干制度时，都在企业内部实行了层层包干制，进一步把投资包干和广大工人群众的生产活动结合起来。石景山钢铁厂实行了从厂到工程处、工段、小组的四段包干，把工程的投资、进度、定额、质量全包给小组，工人参加生产管理，开展混合工种的“多面手”运动。这样就把复杂的基本建设事业，有领导、有计划地交给工人群众，从而大大地激发了群众的积极性，也更加促使领导上有事就和群众商量解决。
    实行投资包干，是基本建设财务管理制度上的一个根本性的变革。中国人民建设银行的许多单位，大破大立，改变过去对建设单位单纯强调监督的关系，成为支援协作的关系，双方共同努力为生产建设服务。中国人民建设银行北京分行和石景山钢铁厂研究后，把三本账改为一本账，大大简化了拨款手续，减少了报表，提高了效率。建设银行的有关单位也搬到厂内办公，送款上门，就地服务。过去“打油的钱不准买醋”，现在只要在投资限额以内，由石景山钢铁厂统一运用。这种做法受到了这个厂职工的热烈欢迎。
    李先念副总理在会上讲了话。他指出：投资包干制是我国基本建设管理制度的一个方向，是一面鲜明的红旗，它完全符合多快好省建设社会主义的方针。他说：投资包干是最有领导、最有广泛群众基础的经济核算制，是既有政治又有经济的一种核算制，是既有控制又有灵活的核算制。有些人认为实行投资包干会影响经济核算制是不对的。
    李副总理还指出：投资包干制也是一种生产关系的改变，它改变了上下级之间、企业与企业之间、人与人之间的关系。投资包干的本质是依靠党委，发动群众，权力下放，责任下放。这样一种生产关系的改变，有利于促进生产力的发展，大大加快建设速度。
    李副总理最后说：投资包干这种新制度，把国家的愿望和群众的愿望结合起来，把党的领导和群众的积极性结合起来。群众充分发挥了积极性，就会创造出奇迹。
    新华社14日讯　7月5日举行的国务院全体会议第七十八次会议通过的“国务院关于改进基本建设财务管理制度的几项规定”，已经下达各地开始实行。国务院通过的这个规定，是基本建设财务管理工作的新方向，是为了多快好省地进行基本建设所采取的一项革命性的措施。这个规定的主要精神是充分发挥各经济部门和各建设单位的主动性和积极性，鼓励他们在既定的投资数额的范围内，改善管理，精打细算，用同样的钱，办更多的事，并且要依靠党，依靠群众来监督资金的合理使用，以促进建设事业的高速度的发展。
    这个规定的要点是：（一）年度国民经济计划和国家预算确定的基本建设投资（包括基本建设工作量和储备资金），在保证不降低生产能力、不推迟交工日期、不突破投资总额和不增加非生产建设比重的条件下，交由各有关建设部门和单位，统一掌握，自行安排，包干使用。（二）建设部门和建设单位在确定的投资总额的范围以内，有权因地、因事制宜，修改设计定额，调整建设项目，并且在各个项目之间调剂使用资金。原定的建设工程竣工以后，资金如有结余，可以仍然留给建设部门和建设单位另行使用（主要使用在生产建设上）。建设部门和建设单位资金使用得越合理，节约越多，基本建设规模可以搞得越大。（三）各部门各单位的基本建设，到年度终了，工程未完，投资有余的时候，这些资金结转到下年继续使用，不再采取年终收回的办法。此外，这个规定对今后财政部门在基本建设拨款方面的工作和基本建设拨款机构的设置等问题也作了新的规定。
