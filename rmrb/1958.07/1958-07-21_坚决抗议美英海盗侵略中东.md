If the US and British imperialists do not stop their acts of aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, they will bear all the serious consequences.

The Chinese people and writers and artists are always the most loyal friends of the Arab people, and we will, together with peace-loving countries and people all over the world, fully support the just struggle of the Arab people and defeat all the aggressive conspiracies of the imperialists.

The written statement warns the US imperialists, "Must immediately stop its acts of aggression and immediately withdraw its invading troops from Lebanon!

The statement said: The Chinese people and the nation's science and technology workers express their full support for the just struggle of the Iraqi and Lebanese people, and resolutely protest against the armed interference of the US imperialists, who have the true nature of wolves and are extremely ferocious.

We protest and condemn with extreme anger this aggressive act of US imperialism that suppresses the Arab national independence movement and seriously threatens peace in West Asia and the world.

"The Red Cross Society of China has always advocated that opposing war and defending peace is the greatest humanitarianism. Stopping US imperialism's aggression against the Lebanese people is the sacred duty of every Red Cross member. We call on all members of the Red Cross Society of China and appeal to the Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Lion and Sun societies of all countries to take concerted and active action, together with the peace-loving people of the world, to promote the immediate withdrawal of US troops invading Lebanon and to wage a resolute struggle to safeguard the Middle East and world peace."
