Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 22nd: Hong Kong and Macao compatriots are furiously condemning the armed intervention in the Middle East by US and British imperialism. People from all walks of life have held symposiums or jointly written letters of protest in recent days, and published statements in newspapers, severely condemning the aggressive actions of US and British imperialism.

    The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions and the Macao Federation of Trade Unions held board meetings on the evening of the 19th respectively. Their speeches at the meetings expressed the strong resentment of workers in Hong Kong and Macao against US and British imperialist aggression. Workers in various industries in Hong Kong and Macao, suburban farmers, employees of commercial firms, teachers, students, and many social organizations have held report meetings and symposiums in recent days to discuss the situation in the Middle East. Speakers have expressed their firm opposition to the new military adventures of US and British imperialism. Macao workers also held a mass rally of thousands of people on the 20th to lodge a serious protest against US and British imperialism.

    Many industrialists and businessmen, women, cultural circles, film circles, well-known social figures, as well as principals of some schools and heads of social organizations in Hong Kong and Macao have issued statements in the past four days, expressing their firm support for the statements and protests of our government, and demanding that the US and Britain get out of the Middle East quickly. Li Sheng, chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, said that the aggressive actions of US and British imperialism have seriously undermined international law and the "United Nations Charter." Therefore, all peace-loving people cannot help but feel angry. US and British invading troops must immediately get out of the Middle East, and US invading troops must get out of Taiwan. Liu Youxin, Director of the Hong Kong Chinese Islamic Philanthropic Society, said that the just struggle of the people of Arab countries will surely receive the support of all righteous Muslims. Liu Fang, chairman of the Hong Kong South China Film Workers Union, pointed out that the war-mongering actions of US and British imperialism seriously threaten world peace. Li Guohua, a family member of the Hong Kong "Flying Goose" sailors killed by US planes in Indonesian waters in April this year, demanded, as a person who has suffered from imperialism, that all peace-loving people unite and resolutely stop the US-British aggression against the Middle East. Gao Zhuoxiong, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Tang Bingda, vice chairman of the Hong Kong North and South Trade Association, and Ma Wanhua, vice chairman of the Macao Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, also issued statements condemning the aggression of US and British imperialism.

    On the 21st, the Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" and "Ta Kung Pao" used a full three pages, but still did not finish publishing the talks of people from all walks of life and the letters of protest against US and British imperialism.
