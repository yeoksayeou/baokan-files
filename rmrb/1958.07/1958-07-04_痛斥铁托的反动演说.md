A Striking Contrast

Tito's fabrication that "in almost all these countries, the vast majority of the people no longer believe in this" (referring to our criticism of revisionism) is completely in tune with the tone of the "New York Times." We want to ask Tito what is the basis for saying this? Our Party is a long-tested Party, our people are a people who have gone through arduous struggles, and we all clearly understand the enormous harm of revisionists in Marxist clothing to the proletarian cause. Therefore, our people nationwide are ideologically and practically united closely around the Party.

Tito slanders our serious struggle against revisionism as a means of attacking them to solve our own difficulties. This is an insult to the heroic Chinese people. We are today in an era where one day equals twenty years, and our country is like the morning sun. A large number of experts and inventors are emerging from among the workers and peasants. The people of the whole country are promoting the great leap forward of our motherland at an unprecedented pace. Our steel will soon catch up with and surpass Britain, and our coal will catch up next year. Large, medium, and small enterprises are springing up like mushrooms after rain. The countryside is realizing water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification... This year's summer grain harvest increased by 35 billion catties compared to last year, and the total wheat output exceeded that of the United States, ranking second in the world. Yet Tito is there praising American wheat and dollars! Isn't the contrast between the truly beautiful and good versus the falsely ugly and evil very stark here?

The Traitor's Ugly Face Fully Exposed

Tito said that the Chinese Communist Party is "opposed to easing world tensions" and is "in the same position as the most reactionary warmongers in the West." This is truly despicable and shameless to the extreme. The Chinese people have long suffered from the pain of imperialist aggression and have defended peace at the cost of blood and sacrifice. The great contributions we have made to the cause of peace together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are universally recognized. Only imperialists and their partners deliberately deny this glorious fact. Tito follows behind Dulles, making such shameless slanders against socialist countries, and yet he calls himself a "socialist," which is a great irony to himself.

Tito said that in order to defend "peace," there should be no socialist camp, but "cooperative relations should be established with all countries." The socialist camp is the mainstay of defending world peace. Imperialism has tried every possible means in the past and present to dismantle the unity of socialist countries, and the result has been shameful failures time and time again. Tito is blindly advocating the absurd proposition of not having a socialist camp, while boasting about being "Marxist-Leninist." Isn't this a "Trojan horse strategy"? Isn't this helping imperialism to undermine socialism from within?

Tito's fabrication that the Chinese Communist Party criticizes them because they "have internal difficulties" is an even more shameless slander. The Chinese people never hide their difficulties in building socialism. However, we have the Marxist-Leninist leadership of the Communist Party, the soaring enthusiasm of 600 million people, the mutual support of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union, and the support of the people of the world. We have overcome and will overcome all difficulties, and have achieved and will achieve earth-shaking victories. The bones of the Chinese people are hard. We will forever despise, scorn, and hate all imperialists. Tito's use of a petty person's mind to speculate about the great Chinese people can only reveal Tito's own shamelessness even more.

### 痛斥铁托的反动演说

    痛斥铁托的反动演说
    鲜明的对比
    铁托造谣说：“几乎在所有这些国家中，巨大多数的人民不再相信这一套了”（指我们对修正主义的批判），这完全和“纽约时报”的口吻一模一样。我们要问铁托说这话的根据是什么？我们的党是久经考验的党，我们的人民是经过艰苦斗争的人民，我们都清楚，披着马克思主义外衣的修正主义者对无产阶级事业的巨大危害。因此，我们全国人民从思想上到行动上都是紧紧的团结在党的周围。
    铁托把我们对修正主义的严肃斗争，污蔑为用攻击他们的手段以解决自己的困难。这是对英雄的中国人民的侮辱。我们今天正处在一天等于二十年的时代，我们的国家正像早晨的太阳。工农中涌现出大批的专家、发明家。全国人民以空前的干劲推动我们祖国一日千里的跃进。我们的钢很快就要赶上并超过英国，煤明年就赶上。大、中、小企业像雨后春笋。农村正在实现水利化、机械化、电气化……。今年夏收粮食比去年增产三百五十亿斤，小麦总产量超过美国，跃居世界第二位。而铁托却在那里为美国的小麦和金元唱赞美诗！这里，真美善和假丑恶的对比不是十分鲜明吗？

    叛徒的丑态毕露
    铁托说中国共产党是“反对缓和世界紧张局势的”。“同西方最反动的战争贩子处于同样的地位”。这真是卑鄙无耻到了极点。中国人民长期身受帝国主义侵略的痛苦，不惜流血牺牲地保卫和平。我们和苏联及其他社会主义国家一道为和平事业建立的伟大功勋，是举世共见的。只有帝国主义者和它的伙伴才故意否认这个光辉的事实。铁托跟在杜勒斯的后头，对社会主义国家进行这种厚颜无耻的诽谤，而他还自命为“社会主义”者，这真是对自己的极大讽刺。
    铁托说为了保卫“和平”，应该不要社会主义阵营，而“同一切国家建立合作的关系”。社会主义阵营是保卫世界和平的中坚，帝国主义过去和现在都千方百计地妄图拆散社会主义各国的团结，结果一次又一次地可耻地失败了。铁托一味鼓吹不要社会主义阵营的荒谬主张，而又自吹自擂为“马列主义”。这不是“特洛依木马计”是什么？这不是帮忙帝国主义从内部来破坏社会主义是什么？
    铁托造谣说，中国共产党之所以批判他们，是因为“有内部困难”，这更是无耻的污蔑。中国人民从不隐瞒自己在建设社会主义中的困难。但是，我们有共产党的马列主义的领导、有六亿人民的冲天干劲，有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的相互支援，有世界人民的支持。我们已经克服了并且还要克服一切困难，取得了并且还要取得翻天复地的胜利。中国人民的骨头是硬的。我们永远鄙视、藐视、仇视一切帝国主义者。铁托用小人之心去猜度伟大的中国人民，却只能更加显露了铁托自己的无耻。
