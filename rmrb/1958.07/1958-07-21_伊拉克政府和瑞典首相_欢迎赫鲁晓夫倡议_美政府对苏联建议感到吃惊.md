Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: Cairo Dispatch: An official in Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim's office stated today that they support Khrushchev's proposal for a five-nation summit to discuss halting the U.S. and British military aggression in the Near East.

The official told a United Press International reporter in Cairo by telephone: "Any summit held by world leaders would be in the best interests of everyone, and we are in favor of holding such a meeting."

He also said that whether Prime Minister Qasim would attend such a meeting—if he were invited—would depend on "the international and local situations."

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: TASS, Stockholm, July 20th: Swedish Prime Minister Erlander told reporters from the Swedish newspaper "News Morning Post" that the Soviet proposal for an immediate high-level meeting should not be rejected.

Erlander said, "I have read Khrushchev's initiative with great interest, and I believe that in the current very serious situation, his initiative is a proposal that should not be rejected." Erlander continued, "An important factor in the proposal is that the Soviet Union believes it is necessary to maintain very close contact with the United Nations, as it suggests that UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld participate in the meeting."

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: New York Dispatch: According to Western news agencies, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's proposal to convene a summit of major powers to halt U.S. and British military intervention in the Middle East has aroused "widespread interest" in the United Nations. Observers believe that holding a summit of major powers as suggested by the Soviet Union would be "beneficial."

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: Washington Dispatch: After the news of Khrushchev's proposal to convene a summit of major powers to halt U.S. and British military intervention in the Middle East reached Washington, U.S. President Eisenhower immediately telephoned Secretary of State Dulles to discuss the Soviet proposal. Dulles also studied the proposal with British Foreign Secretary Lloyd during their meeting. It is reported that although Washington officials are trying to downplay the significance of the proposal, dismissing it as "propaganda" of "the Soviet Union intensifying psychological warfare," they have to admit that the proposal is so "specific and clear" that they are "surprised."

The State Department hastily issued a statement on the Soviet proposal. The statement stubbornly defended the U.S.'s actions of armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries.

    伊拉克政府和瑞典首相
    欢迎赫鲁晓夫倡议
    美政府对苏联建议感到吃惊
    新华社20日讯  开罗消息：伊拉克总理卡塞姆的办公室的一个发言人今天表示赞成赫鲁晓夫关于召开五国政府首脑会议来讨论制止美英在中近东的军事侵略行动的建议。
    这个发言人通过电话对在开罗的合众国际社记者说：“世界各国首脑举行的任何会议都将是符合大家的最高利益的，我们赞成举行这种会议。”
    他还说，卡塞姆总理是否会出席这样一个会议——如果他受到邀请的话——将取决于“国际局势和当地的局势”。
    据新华社20日讯  据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩20日讯：瑞典首相埃兰德对瑞典“新闻晨报”的记者发表谈话说：苏联关于立即召开高级会议的建议不应被拒绝。
    埃兰德说，“我极感兴趣地拜读了赫鲁晓夫的倡议，我认为，在当前十分严重的局势下，他的倡议是不应被拒绝的主张。”埃兰德接着说，“建议中的一个重要因素，是苏联认为必须同联合国保持十分密切的接触，因为它建议联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德参加会议。”
    新华社20日讯  纽约消息：据西方通讯社报道，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫关于召开大国政府首脑会议来制止美英在中近东的军事干涉行动的建议在联合国中引起“广泛的兴趣”。观察家认为，召开苏联建议的大国政府首脑会议是有“好处”的。
    据新华社20日讯  华盛顿消息：赫鲁晓夫建议召开大国首脑会议来制止美英在中东军事干涉的消息到达华盛顿后，美国总统艾森豪威尔立即同国务卿杜勒斯通电话，商讨苏联的建议。杜勒斯在同英国外交大臣劳埃德会谈时也研究了这个建议。据报道，华盛顿官员虽然在竭力贬低这个建议的意义，把它说成是“苏联加紧神经战”的“宣传”，但是他们不得不承认，这个建议是这样“具体和明确”，使得他们感到“吃惊”。
    国务院匆忙就苏联的建议发表了一个声明。这个声明顽固地为美国武装干涉阿拉伯国家内政的行动辩护。
