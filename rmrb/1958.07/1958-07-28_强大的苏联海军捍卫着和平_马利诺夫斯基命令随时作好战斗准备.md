    Powerful Soviet Navy Defends Peace
    Malinovsky Orders Readiness for Combat at Any Time
    (Dispatch from our Moscow correspondent, July 27) The Soviet people celebrated the annual Navy Day on July 27. The Soviet Ministry of Defense, together with people from all walks of life in Moscow, held a grand celebration on the evening of the 26th. For forty years since Lenin issued the order to establish the Soviet Navy on February 4, 1918, the Soviet Navy has withstood various severe tests in history. Today, it has become a powerful navy and a great force defending world peace.
    Marshal Malinovsky, the Soviet Minister of Defense, issued an order commemorating Soviet Navy Day, stating that the sharp aggravation of the international situation caused by the American and British imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan requires Soviet naval fighters and all Soviet soldiers to further enhance their vigilance, "demanding that all warships and units be ready for combat."
    The Soviet "Pravda" said in an editorial commemorating Navy Day that the Soviet Navy, equipped with modern naval combat equipment, can not only defend our coastline, but also, in coordination with the air force, destroy the enemy's military forces at sea. In addition, it can also deliver powerful blows to targets located on other continents. The Soviet Black Sea Fleet, Pacific Fleet, Baltic Fleet, Barents Sea Fleet, and Northern Fleet all have the most modern types of warships equipped with sophisticated modern weapons.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 27th. Naval personnel throughout the Soviet Union, while commemorating Soviet Navy Day, have expressed their determination to further strengthen the fleet's strength, defend the motherland, and strike at aggressors.
    Admiral Gorshkov wrote in "Pravda" that the Soviet people angrily protested the American and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East and, together with the people of the world, condemned the colonialists' attempts to enslave the people of the East.
    Gorshkov pointed out that the imperialist rulers, headed by the United States, are increasing military spending year after year, strengthening aggressive blocs, and establishing military bases around the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, actively preparing for a new war. In this situation, the Soviet people should always pay attention to strengthening their national defense capabilities and improving the combat capabilities of the sea, land, and air forces.
    Admiral Zozulya wrote in "Red Star" that the current international situation requires more persistent study to prepare for fighting against enemies equipped with modern technology. All soldiers should master combat techniques and weapons perfectly. Commanders should improve their strategic knowledge and demonstrate originality in organizing naval military operations.
    Admiral Basissti wrote in "Labor News" that the whole world is angrily condemning the American and British robbers who interfered in Arab countries. This new crime of the colonialists once again reminds us that we must further strengthen the national defense capabilities of socialist countries and protect the security of the motherland with modern science and technology.

    强大的苏联海军捍卫着和平
    马利诺夫斯基命令随时作好战斗准备
    本报莫斯科27日电　7月27日苏联全国人民庆祝了一年一度的海军节。苏联国防部同莫斯科各界一起在26日晚上举行了隆重的庆祝会。自从1918年2月4日列宁发布建立苏联海军的命令后四十年来，苏联海军经受住了历史上各种严重的考验。在今天，它已经成为一支强大的海军和捍卫世界和平的伟大力量。
    苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅发布了纪念苏联海军节的命令，命令说，由于美英帝国主义者侵略黎巴嫩和约旦而引起的国际局势的尖锐化，要求苏联海军战士和全体苏军战士进一步提高警惕性，“要求所有的军舰和部队都作好战斗准备。”
    苏联“真理报”在纪念海军节的社论中说，拥有现代化海上作战装备的苏联海军，不仅能够捍卫我国的海岸线，并且在空军的配合下可以消灭敌人在海上的军事力量。此外，对设在其他大陆上的目标也能给以强有力的打击。苏联的黑海舰队、太平洋舰队、波罗的海舰队、巴仑支海舰队和北方舰队，都具有最现代化的各种类型的军舰，这些军舰上装备有完善的现代化的武器。
    新华社莫斯科27日电　苏联各地的海军人员在纪念苏联海军节的时候，纷纷表示将进一步加强舰队力量，保卫祖国，打击侵略者。
    戈尔什科夫海军上将在“真理报”上写道，苏联人民愤怒抗议美英帝国主义在中近东的侵略，并且和全世界人民一道，谴责殖民主义者企图奴役东方人民的行动。
    戈尔什科夫指出，以美国为首的帝国主义统治者年年在增加军费开支，加强侵略集团，并且在苏联及其他社会主义国家周围建立军事基地，积极准备新战争。在这种局势下，苏联人民应该经常注意加强国防力量，提高海、陆、空军的战斗能力。
    佐祖利亚海军上将在“红星报”上写道，现代国际局势要求更顽强地学习，准备同具有现代技术装备的敌人作斗争。全体战士应该完善地掌握战斗技术和武器。指挥官应该提高战略知识，在组织海上军事行动方面表现出独创精神。
    巴西斯蒂海军上将在“劳动报”上写道，全世界都在愤怒谴责干涉阿拉伯国家的美国和英国强盗。殖民主义者的这一新罪行，再一次提醒我们，必须进一步加强社会主义国家的国防力量，以现代化的科学技术来保卫祖国安全。
