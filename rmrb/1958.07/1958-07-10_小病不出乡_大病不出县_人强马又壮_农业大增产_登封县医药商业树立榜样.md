Minor Illnesses Treated in the Township, Major Illnesses Treated in the County; People Strong and Horses Robust, Great Increase in Agricultural Production
Dengfeng County's Medical and Commercial Sector Sets an Example

(By our reporter) Dengfeng County, Henan Province, the medical and commercial departments have broken out of the circle of commercial work and, together with the health departments, have changed the backward medical and health conditions in the countryside, enabling the county to achieve "Minor illnesses treated in the township, major illnesses treated in the county, people strong and horses robust, great increase in agricultural production". The First Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Health recently jointly held an on-site meeting in Dengfeng County, unanimously considering this a model advanced example in medical and commercial work.

Anyone who has visited Dengfeng has been attracted by the area's health work. A sound four-level health care network has been established: the county seat has a modern specialized hospital and a medical wholesale department that handles more than 1,200 kinds of medical supplies; the districts have health centers and medical wholesale and retail supply points; below the districts, every township has clinics and every cooperative has maternity hospitals; and each production team is equipped with health workers, sanitation workers, epidemic prevention workers, and veterinarians. Farmers have made hygiene a habit, every household has a "peace" water tank and a garbage can at the door, the rooms are tidy and clean, and the clothes and bedding are washed snow-white; bowls have cupboards, chopsticks have chopstick bags; toilets have sheds, and manure tanks have lids, truly achieving no flies, no maggots, and no odor; every township has bath ponds, young adults have generally brushed their teeth, and maternal and child health care is particularly outstanding. The county has fully implemented new-method deliveries. Thanks to the well-developed medical and health work, diseases have been reduced, ensuring that all 140,000 laborers in the county can participate in production normally.

The medical and commercial departments of Dengfeng County have played a great role in promoting the development of medical and health work. They closely combined the supply of medicine with health work, and their own business developed in the development of the people's health cause. When the county established a four-level medical and health care network, agricultural cooperatives wanted to establish "four staff members". With the support of the First Ministry of Commerce, the medical and commercial departments sent pharmacists to actively cooperate with the health departments, adopting a method of combining medicine and pharmacy, combining textbooks and physical objects, to help the agricultural cooperatives train more than 230 health workers. These health workers both produced and treated diseases, ensuring that members were not delayed from production due to minor illnesses or injuries. The county wanted to build a modern specialized hospital, but it lacked large-scale medical equipment. The county commercial departments actively helped the county hospital equip itself with 39 kinds of large-scale equipment, such as X-ray machines and universal operating tables, worth about 80,000 yuan; and with the approval of the First Ministry of Commerce, they adopted an installment payment method to solve the urgent need for the hospital to add medical equipment.

After the establishment of the county's four-level medical and health care network, they actively strengthened the cooperation between medicine and pharmacy, and signed a "three-in-one" agreement for supply, sales, and use. Whatever the medical departments needed, the supply and sales departments would supply, and they would supply as much as was needed. In order to ensure timely supply, they also extended commercial institutions downwards, carried out wholesale and retail business and implemented delivery to the countryside, so that the health workers of each cooperative and team could obtain the necessary drug supplies. Medical units at all levels also frequently reflected the development of local rural health undertakings and the incidence and medication of diseases in different seasons to the medical and commercial departments as a reference for the commercial departments to organize sources of goods. This further enabled the purchasing and sales work of the commercial departments to adapt to the needs of the countryside.

    小病不出乡  大病不出县  人强马又壮  农业大增产
    登封县医药商业树立榜样
    本报讯  河南省登封县医药商业部门跳出商业工作的圈子，和卫生部门一道改变了农村落后的医药卫生面貌，使这个县做到了“小病不出乡、大病不出县、人强马又壮、农业大增产”。第一商业部和卫生部最近在登封县联合召开了现场会议，一致认为这是医药商业工作中的一面先进旗帜。
    凡是到登封参观过的人，都为这里的卫生工作面貌吸引住了。一个健全的四级卫生医疗网已经建立起来；县城里设有一个现代化的分科医院和一个经营一千二百多种医药用品的医药批发部；区里有卫生院和医药批零供应点；区以下乡乡有诊疗所、社社有妇产院；每个生产队还设有保健员、卫生员、防疫员、兽医员。农民讲卫生已成了习惯，家家户户的门口都有太平缸、垃圾箱，屋里整齐清洁，衣服被褥洗得雪白干净；碗有碗柜，筷有筷袋；厕所有棚，粪缸有盖，真正做到无蝇、无蛆、无臭味；乡乡设有洗澡塘，青壮年已普遍刷牙，妇幼保健工作更是突出，全县已全部实行新法接生，由于医疗卫生工作开展得好，疾病减少，保证了全县十四万劳动力都能够正常地参加生产。
    登封县的医药商业部门在发展医药卫生工作中起了很大的促进作用。他们把医药供应和卫生工作紧密地结合起来，在人民卫生事业的发展中，本身业务也得到了发展。当全县建立四级医疗保健网时，农业社要设立“四员”，医药商业部门在第一商业部的支援下，派出药剂师，主动配合卫生部门，采用医与药结合、课本与实物结合的办法，帮助农业社训练了二百三十多名保健员，这些保健员一面生产、一面治病，保证社员不因小病或外伤而耽误生产。县里要建立一个现代化的分科医院，但缺乏大型医疗器械，县商业部门就积极帮助县医院装备了X光机、万能手术床等三十九种约值八万元的大型器械；并经第一商业部批准，采用分期付款的办法，解决了医院增添医疗设备的迫切需要。
    在全县四级医疗保健网建立以后，他们又积极加强医药双方的协作，订立了供、销、用“三合一”的协议，医药部门需要什么，供销部门就供应什么，要多少就供应多少。为了保证及时供应，他们还把商业机构下伸，开展批发零售业务并实行送货下乡，使每个社、队的保健员都得到必需的药品供应。各级医疗单位也经常把当地农村卫生事业的发展以及不同季节发病及用药情况反映给医药商业部门，作为商业部门组织货源的参考。这样就更进一步使商业部门的购销工作能适应农村需要。
