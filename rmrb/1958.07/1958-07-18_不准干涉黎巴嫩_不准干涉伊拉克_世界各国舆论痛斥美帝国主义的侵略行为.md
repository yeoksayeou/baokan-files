(Comprehensive report by our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency reports: The United States' bandit-like act of aggression against Lebanon has aroused strong condemnation from world public opinion. The Soviet Union's "Pravda," North Korea's "Rodong Sinmun," Vietnam's "Nhan Dan," Mongolia's "Unen," Czechoslovakia's "Rude Pravo," Bulgaria's "Rabotnichesko Delo" and "Otechestven Front," Romania's "Scînteia," and Albania's "Zëri i Popullit," all published editorials on the 16th and 17th, condemning the US invading forces for their aggression against Lebanon, and condemning the US imperialism's new conspiracy against the Arab national independence movement.

    Soviet "Pravda" said: The United States attempts to maintain its colonial rule over Middle Eastern countries.

    The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on the 17th entitled "Hands Off!" saying that all Soviet people warmly support the Soviet government's statement on the Middle East situation issued on the 16th. Soviet people, along with billions of people in all countries, protest in unison and with anger demand that US imperialists: do not interfere in Lebanon! Do not interfere in Iraq! Do not interfere in all Arab countries that uphold freedom and independence! The United States, in front of the whole world, has blatantly carried out the most brutal military intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs, embarking on the path of openly aggressing against the peace-loving Arab people. This makes it particularly clear why the US government did not accept the Soviet government's proposal of February 11, 1957, regarding non-interference by major powers in the internal affairs of countries in this region. The US government refused to assume obligations that could guarantee the maintenance of peace in the world and the easing of tensions in this region. It wants to carry out aggressive actions at will in the Arab East, which poses a serious threat to peace and has far-reaching consequences.

    The editorial said that the US government has taken aggressive actions behind the back of the United Nations, violating all norms of international law and the UN Charter. The clumsy attempts by the US ruling clique to deceive the public and their crude pressure on the United Nations to endorse US aggression can only arouse the deepest indignation.

    The real reason for the US military intervention in Lebanon is that the oil monopoly capital attempts to maintain its colonial rule in the Middle East countries. After learning that the Baghdad Pact and the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine" had completely gone bankrupt, the US ruling clique trotted out the Rockefeller Doctrine. This doctrine requires stepping up the expansion of armaments, making the entire US strategy subservient to preparing for "total war" and "small wars," and establishing special forces to suppress the national liberation movements in Eastern countries. Now, the whole world sees that this sinister doctrine of aggression and war has been put into action.

    The editorial said that Washington's official statement leaves no doubt that the US military intervention in Lebanon is only the first step in launching a colonial war against the people of various Arab countries. The next step is expected to be US and British military intervention in Iraq's internal affairs.

    The editorial said that the actions of US imperialists pose a serious threat to world peace and security. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world were deeply indignant when they heard that US troops had brazenly invaded Lebanon.

    Cairo newspapers pointed out: The United States is an open challenge to the entire Arab nation.

    Cairo newspapers published editorials on the 16th, denouncing the US military's armed intervention in Lebanon as a violation of the UN Charter and Lebanon's independence.

    "Al-Gomhouria" pointed out that the US action is a blatant aggression, an open challenge to the Lebanese people, the entire Arab nation, and all peace-loving people. The real motive of the US government is to destroy Arab nationalism. However, this action will only strengthen the Lebanese people's determination to eliminate imperialism and its agents.

    The newspaper said that the fate suffered by the British and French aggressors in Port Said is awaiting the US troops landing in Beirut.

    "Al-Shaab" said that the US intervention in Lebanon is an open challenge to the decisions made by the United Nations, because the UN observer group has already announced that there is no interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.

    "Al-Ahram" pointed out that the Lebanese people will continue to resist and will achieve complete liberation.

    Indian newspapers said: All US intervention excuses are untenable.

    Indian newspapers condemned the US for pushing the world to the brink of war in editorials, columns, and cartoons. On the 17th, all newspapers wrote in large headlines across the page: "Russia and China recognize the newly established Republic of Iraq" and "Russia demands that the United States withdraw from Lebanon." The "Hindustan Times" editorial refuted all US President Eisenhower's arguments for intervening in Lebanon. The editorial said: It is attacking not only Arab nationalism, but also the United Nations itself.

    The Hindi daily "Nava Bharat Times" said: "The principles and rhetoric followed by the United States are thoroughly hypocritical."

    "Free Press" said that due to the US military intervention, "the true face of the US and British diplomatic activities to regain control of West Asia has been completely exposed." The editorial pointed out the US's aggressive actions taken in Korea under similar conditions. It believes that the Soviet representative's demand at the United Nations for US troops to withdraw from Lebanon is justified.

    Indonesian newspapers said: The United States stands with the traitors of Lebanon.

    All Jakarta evening newspapers unanimously condemned the US armed intervention in Lebanon on the 16th.

    "Waspada" said that the US action must be condemned. It said that the US action proves that it stands with the traitors of Lebanon, openly defying the will of the people.

    "Republik" pointed out that the US military intervention of aggression against Lebanon has violated the UN Charter. Peace-loving people and supporters of the UN Charter should unanimously condemn the US action.

    The newspaper also pointed out that the United States used the pretext of "protecting the lives of Americans" when sending troops to land in Lebanon, which gives many lessons to countries with Americans living there and American monopoly capital. The United States may use the same pretext to send troops to many other Asian and African countries.

    Pakistani newspapers said: The Arab national independence movement is unstoppable.

    "The Pakistan Times" pointed out that the Iraqi revolution is a clear manifestation of Arab opposition to Western hegemony and its agents. It added, "It can be said with greater confidence than before that now, even if the people of Iraq or any other Arab country are suppressed, they will rise up again and again until they defeat foreign imperialism and its agents and achieve final victory." Karachi's "Today's News" said, "It is imperative that the United States and Britain and other signatories of the Baghdad Pact learn a lesson from the Iraqi revolution." "No matter how the Western countries organize the Baghdad Pact or proclaim the Eisenhower Doctrine a thousand times, they can never make friends with the Arabs."

    The editorial said, "The facts show that instead of learning a lesson, the Western countries are even more desperately creating excuses to launch a planned offensive against Iraq and Lebanon."

    The editorial said that the people of the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa, have a responsibility, and they should not allow this attempt to launch a war to succeed.

    "Jang" published an editorial saying, "The Iraqi revolution is a manifestation of Arab nationalism." The newspaper said that the Pakistani authorities imposed the Baghdad Pact on Pakistan without consulting the people of the country. The newspaper said, "If the Pakistani authorities had not obeyed the United States and Britain, it would not have joined the Baghdad Pact, and we would not have lost the friendship of Arab countries." "Karachi Times" said in an editorial, "Even the sun of the United States is about to set. We need decision-makers who keep up with the times. Our rulers are undergoing a severe test," they either maintain the independence of the country or abandon independence.

    Japanese Communist Party "Akahata" editorial said: The US aggression plan will inevitably fail in the end.

    The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" published an editorial on the 17th, strongly protesting the US imperialist armed interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries.

    The editorial first expressed support for the newly established revolutionary government of Iraq and congratulated the victory of the Iraqi people's struggle.

    The editorial then strongly condemned the United States for sending troops to land in Lebanon, brazenly starting the aggressive action of forcibly interfering in the internal affairs of the Arab people. The editorial said that this action by the United States has no legal basis, let alone moral justification. The purpose of the United States is to rebuild by force the control over the Middle Eastern countries that collapsed due to the struggle of the Lebanese people and the successful Iraqi revolution. The United States blatantly carried out armed intervention in Lebanon, and its purpose is also to destroy the Iraqi revolutionary regime and control Iraq by force.

    The editorial pointed out that in order to maintain its oil interests in the Middle East and ensure its military control over the Middle East, US monopoly capital brazenly sent troops to invade Lebanon, which exposed the true face of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

    "Akahata" demanded that the United Nations Security Council immediately take effective measures to stop the US aggression, and demanded that the Japanese representative in the United Nations launch active action for this purpose. "Akahata" pointed out that the world's peaceful forces once stopped the armed aggression of Britain and France against Egypt, causing their aggression to fail. Now, the United States and other imperialist forces dare to forcibly implement its aggression plan, and will inevitably be opposed by the people of Lebanon, Iraq and other Arab countries as well as the people of the world and will eventually fail.

### 不准干涉黎巴嫩　不准干涉伊拉克  世界各国舆论痛斥美帝国主义的侵略行为

专栏：

    不准干涉黎巴嫩　不准干涉伊拉克
    世界各国舆论痛斥美帝国主义的侵略行为
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：美国侵略黎巴嫩的强盗行为，激起了世界各国舆论的严正谴责。苏联“真理报”、朝鲜“劳动新闻”、越南“人民报”、蒙古“真理报”、捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”、保加利亚“劳动报”和“祖国阵线报”、罗马尼亚“火花报”、阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”，都分别在16日和17日发表了社论，谴责美国侵略军侵略黎巴嫩，谴责美帝国主义反对阿拉伯民族独立运动的新阴谋。
    苏联“真理报”说：美国企图保持对中东国家的殖民统治
    苏联“真理报”17日以“不准动手”为题的社论说，全体苏联人民热烈支持苏联政府16日就中近东事件发表的声明，苏联人民同各国亿万人民同声抗议并且怀着愤怒的心情要求美国帝国主义者：不得干涉黎巴嫩！不得干涉伊拉克！不得干涉维护自由和独立的一切阿拉伯国家！美国在全世界面前竟然对黎巴嫩内政进行最粗暴的军事干涉，走上了公开侵略爱好和平的阿拉伯人民的道路。这一来，就可以特别清楚地看出，美国政府为什么不接受1957年2月11日苏联政府关于大国不干涉这个地区各国内政的建议。美国政府拒绝承担可以保证维持世界这个地区的和平和缓和这个地区紧张局势的义务。它想随心所欲地在阿拉伯东方采取侵略行动，这对和平造成了严重的威胁，并且包藏着影响深远的后果。
    社论说，美国政府背着联合国组织采取了侵略行动，破坏了一切国际法的准则，破坏了联合国宪章。美国统治集团笨拙地企图欺骗公众，他们对联合国施加粗暴的压力、企图使它赞同美国的侵略行为，这种做法只会引起最深刻的愤慨。
    美国对黎巴嫩进行军事干涉的真正原因就是石油垄断资本企图保持它在中近东国家的殖民主义统治。美国统治集团在知道巴格达条约和“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”彻底破产之后，搬出了洛克菲勒主义。这个主义要求加紧扩充军备，使美国的整个战略服从于准备进行“总体战争”和“小规模战争”，建立专门的军队来镇压东方国家的民族解放运动。现在，全世界都看到这个阴险的侵略和战争的主义已经付诸行动。
    社论说，华盛顿的官方声明使人已经不再怀疑，美国军队在黎巴嫩进行的干涉，只是对阿拉伯东方各国人民发动殖民主义战争的第一步。下一步估计就是美国和英国对伊拉克内政进行军事干涉。
    社论说，美国帝国主义者的行动对世界和平和安全造成了严重的威胁。因此，全世界爱好和平的人民听到美国军队悍然侵入黎巴嫩时，十分愤慨。
    开罗报纸指出：美国是对整个阿拉伯民族公开挑战
    开罗各报在16日发表社论斥责美国军队武装干涉黎巴嫩的行动侵犯了联合国宪章和黎巴嫩的独立。
    “共和国报”指出，美国的行动是明目张胆的侵略，是对黎巴嫩人民、对整个阿拉伯民族和对一切爱好和平的人民的公开挑战。美国政府的真实动机是想摧毁阿拉伯民族主义。但是，这种行动只会加强黎巴嫩人民清除帝国主义和它的代理人的决心。
    这家报纸说，英法侵略者在塞得港所遭到的命运正等待着在贝鲁特登陆的美国军队。
    “人民报”说，美国对黎巴嫩的干涉是对联合国所作出的决定的公开挑战，因为，联合国观察团已经宣布不存在任何干涉黎巴嫩内政的事情。
    “金字塔报”指出，黎巴嫩人民将继续进行抵抗，并且将得到完全的解放。
    印度报纸说：美国所有干涉借口都站不住脚
    印度各报在社论、专栏和漫画中谴责美国把世界推向战争的边缘。17日各报都以横贯全页的大标题写道：“俄国和中国承认新成立的伊拉克共和国”和“俄国要求美国撤出黎巴嫩”。“印度斯坦时报”的社论驳斥了美国总统艾森豪威尔的所有关于干涉黎巴嫩的论点。社论说：它攻击的不仅是阿拉伯民族主义，而且是联合国本身。
    印地文日报“新印度时报”说：“美国所遵循的原则和言论都是彻头彻尾虚伪的”。
    “自由新闻”说，由于美国进行军事干涉，“美英为了重新控制西亚而进行的外交活动的面目完全暴露出来了”。社论指出了美国在类似的条件下在朝鲜采取的侵略行动。它认为，苏联代表在联合国要求美国军队撤出黎巴嫩是正当的。
    印度尼西亚报纸说：美国是同黎巴嫩的卖国贼站在一起
    雅加达所有晚报16日一致谴责美国武装干涉黎巴嫩。
    “警惕报”说，美国的行动必须加以谴责。它说，美国的行动证明它同黎巴嫩的卖国贼站在一起，公然违抗人民的意志。
    “共和国报”指出，美国对黎巴嫩进行侵略的军事干涉行动破坏了联合国宪章。爱好和平的人民以及联合国宪章的支持者应当一致谴责美国的行动。
    这家报纸还指出，美国派遣军队在黎巴嫩登陆使用了所谓“保护美国人的生命”的借口，这使得有着美国人居住和有美国垄断资本的国家得到许多教训。美国可能利用同样的借口派兵前往其他许多亚非国家。
    巴基斯坦报纸说：阿拉伯民族独立运动不可遏止
    “巴基斯坦时报”指出，伊拉克革命是阿拉伯反对西方霸权及其代理人的明显的表现。它又说，“可以怀着比以前更大的信心说，现在即使伊拉克人民或任何其他阿拉伯国家人民遭到镇压，他们也将一次又一次起来，直到战胜外国帝国主义及其代理人，取得最后胜利”。卡拉奇“今天报”说，“美国和英国以及巴格达条约其他缔约国极有必要从伊拉克的革命中吸取教训”。“西方国家不论怎样组织巴格达条约，宣告艾森豪威尔主义一千遍，它们也决不可能同阿拉伯人交上朋友。”
    社论说，“事实表明，西方国家不但不吸取教训，反而更竭力制造借口以便对伊拉克和黎巴嫩展开有计划的进攻”。
    社论说，全世界人民，尤其是亚非人民都有责任，他们应当不让这种企图发动战争的行动得逞。
    “战斗报”发表社论说，“伊拉克的革命是阿拉伯民族主义的表现”。这家报纸说，巴基斯坦当局没有和全国人民商量就把巴格达条约强加在巴基斯坦身上。这家报纸说，“如果巴基斯坦当局不对英美百依百顺的话，它就不会参加巴格达条约，我们也就不会失去阿拉伯国家的友谊”。“卡拉奇时报”在社论中说，“甚至美国的太阳也快要落山了。我们需要跟得上时代的决策人。我们的统治者正经历着严重的考验”，他们或者是维护国家的独立或者放弃独立。
    日共“赤旗报”社论说：美国侵略计划最后必遭到失败
    日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”17日发表社论，强烈抗议美帝国主义武装干涉中东各国人民的内政。
    社论首先表示支持新成立的伊拉克革命政府，并且庆贺伊拉克人民斗争的胜利。
    社论接着强烈谴责美国派遣军队在黎巴嫩登陆，悍然开始用武力干涉阿拉伯人民内政的侵略行动。社论说，美国的这种行动没有任何法律根据，更没有道义上的理由。美国的目的是想用武力重建由于黎巴嫩人民的斗争和伊拉克革命成功而崩溃的对中东国家的控制。美国悍然对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉，其目的还在于借以破坏伊拉克革命政权和以武力控制伊拉克。
    社论指出，美国垄断资本为了保持它在中东的石油利益和确保它对中东的军事控制，悍然出兵侵略黎巴嫩，这就暴露了“艾森豪威尔主义”的真正面目。
    “赤旗报”要求联合国安全理事会立即采取有效措施，阻止美国的侵略行动，并且要求联合国中的日本代表为此展开积极行动。“赤旗报”指出，全世界的和平力量曾经阻止了英、法两国对埃及的武装侵略，使它们的侵略归于失败。现在，美国和其它帝国主义势力胆敢强行执行它的侵略计划，也必定会遭到黎巴嫩、伊拉克等阿拉伯国家人民以及世界人民的反对而最后遭到失败。
