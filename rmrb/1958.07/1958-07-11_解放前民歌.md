    Pre-Liberation Folk Songs
    Mountain girls go down to the plains,
    Plains girls don't go up the mountains,
    If you don't want to be a bachelor,
    Pack your bags and go to Taiyuan.
    The Yama's Nose at Zhaigou Cliff,
    Once you've been there, you won't go again,
    Daxiong went to cut firewood,
    His wife at home making white shoes.

    解放前民歌
    山里姑娘下了川，
    川里姑娘不上山，
    如要不把光棍当，
    卷起铺盖到太原。
    阎王鼻子寨沟崖，
    走过一回再不来，
    大凶堑去割柴，
    老婆在家做白鞋。
