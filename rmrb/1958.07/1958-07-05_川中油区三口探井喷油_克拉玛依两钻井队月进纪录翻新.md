Xinhua News Agency, Nanchong, July 4th. Three medium-depth oil exploration wells in the Nanchong and Longnusi structures of the central Sichuan oil region have recently struck oil.

Longnusi Well No. 13 reached a depth of 1,191 meters on June 28th. During the process of extracting clear water from the well to reduce pressure at the bottom, natural gas and oil suddenly erupted from the wellhead, with the oil peak reaching 25 meters. The oil testing workers immediately closed the blowout preventer and directed the oil to discharge into the storage pool. On July 1st, Longnusi Well No. 12 reached a depth of 1,176 meters and, upon entering the oil layer, brought up a large amount of oil from the mud.

Nanchong Structure Well No. 10 gushed a large amount of oil on June 24th when it reached a depth of 1,450 meters. The oil layer encountered in this well is the same as those encountered in two other oil-producing wells on the same structure, forming a triangle.

In order to quickly determine the oil-bearing area of structures such as Nanchong and Longnusi, the Central Sichuan Mining Bureau of the Sichuan Petroleum Administration has started drilling all twenty key wells planned since April of this year, and most of the drilling progress is approaching the target layers. Currently, the staff of each drilling team are accelerating their progress, striving to complete all key wells by mid-July.

Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, July 4th. The Zhang Yunqing drilling team and the Lü Yunshan drilling team of the Karamay mining area created new records for actual monthly progress in production wells and deep exploration wells in June. The Zhang Yunqing team completed three production wells in June, with an actual progress of 1,938 meters. The Lü Yunshan team drilled 1,800 meters in one 3,000-meter deep exploration well for the entire month, breaking the recent record of 1,769.7 meters of monthly progress in exploration wells at the Yumen Oilfield.

The new records created by these two drilling teams have set an example for Karamay drilling workers to further improve drilling speed. Under their leadership, the monthly progress of twelve drilling teams in the mining area reached over 1,000 meters in May, and the monthly progress of eighteen drilling teams reached over 1,000 meters in June.

    川中油区三口探井喷油
    克拉玛依两钻井队月进纪录翻新
    据新华社南充4日电　川中油区南充和龙女寺两个构造上的三口中深石油探井，最近先后喷油。
    龙女十三井6月28日钻到了一千一百九十一公尺，在提捞井内清水，减轻井底压力的过程中，天然气和石油突然从井口喷出，油峰高达二十五公尺。试油工人们立即关好防喷器，引导石油向储油池内放喷。龙女十二井在7月1日钻到一千一百七十六公尺、刚刚进入油层的时候，从泥浆里带出了大量石油。
    南充构造上的第十号井，6月24日钻到一千四百五十公尺时喷出大量石油。这口井所遇到的油层，跟同一构造上另外两口喷油井所遇到的油层相同，它们形成了一个三角形。
    四川石油管理局川中矿务局为了迅速查明南充和龙女寺等构造的储油面积，从今年4月份起所布置的二十口关键井已经全部开钻，而且大部分钻井的进尺接近了目的层。现在，各钻井队的职工们正在加快进尺速度，争取在7月中旬钻完全部关键井。
    据新华社克拉玛依4日电  克拉玛依矿区张云清钻井队和吕云山钻井队，6月份创造了生产井和深探井实际月进尺的新纪录。张云清井队在6月份共钻完了三口生产井，实际进尺达到一千九百三十八公尺；吕云山井队在一口深三千公尺的探井上，全月钻进一千八百公尺，刷新了最近玉门油矿探井月进尺一千七百六十九点七公尺的纪录。
    这两个钻井队创造的新纪录，给克拉玛依钻井职工进一步提高钻井速度树立了榜样。在他们的带动下，矿区5月份有十二个井队的月进尺达到了一千公尺以上，6月份有十八个井队月进尺达到了一千公尺以上。（附图片）
