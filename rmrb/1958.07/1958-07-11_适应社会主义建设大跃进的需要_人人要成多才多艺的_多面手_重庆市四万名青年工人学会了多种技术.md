To Adapt to the Needs of the Socialist Construction Great Leap Forward
Everyone Must Become a Versatile "All-Rounder"
40,000 Young Workers in Chongqing Learn Multiple Skills

(Our newspaper's Chongqing dispatch on the 10th, by reporter Ping Lan) Since Chongqing launched the "Specialize in One, Seek Many, Develop Multi-Trade Technical Learning" campaign in May, it has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of young workers to become "all-rounders."

At present, 40,000 young workers in the steel, machinery, and construction systems have participated in this activity, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of young workers in these departments. After a short period of hard work and study, these young people have generally mastered two or three skills, and some have learned as many as nine or ten skills. Their learning methods mostly involve signing teaching contracts with master craftsmen, or young workers teaching each other, or parents and children, husbands and wives teaching each other. They also use a variety of learning methods such as on-site lectures and training classes to learn as many skills as possible as quickly as possible.

Many units believe that carrying out multi-trade technical learning has the following three main benefits:

First, this is an important method for rapidly cultivating our own technical workforce of the working class. Young workers in Chongqing account for more than 30% of the total number of employees. If the multi-trade technical learning activity is carried out persistently, a large number of technical backbones can be cultivated. For example, Huang Rongchang, a nationally renowned advanced producer, was originally just an ordinary young carpenter. After he learned skills such as turning, fitting, planing, and milling, he has become the most popular technician in the factory.

Second, it has rapidly promoted the development of the technical revolution movement. Most of the current emerging technical innovation experts possess multi-faceted technical knowledge. While mastering one technology, they also learn and master multiple technologies. The "specialization" and "multiplicity" influence each other, opening up their minds and enabling them to exert endless creativity. For example, Wei Gaohou, a young inspection worker at Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, could not master a single technology originally. Since March of this year, because he has been apprenticed to four masters at the same time and learned multiple technologies, learning technology while improving technology, he has now basically mastered seven technologies and put forward more than 200 technical innovation suggestions. Recently, he changed the method of processing milling machine washers from the original fitter processing method to rolling machine processing, which increased work efficiency by more than 30,000 times, and was praised by all the factory employees as a "wise man." The Su Bingcheng Youth Assault Team of the Chongqing Shizitan Power Station was originally just an overhead line assault team. Now they can do nine types of work such as rebar, concrete, earthwork, and operation. Each type of work can exceed the quota. It has now been officially named the "Omnipotent Assault Team" by the Communist Youth League Committee of this unit.

Third, it can solve the new contradictions of machine equipment, raw material supply, and technical strength that have emerged in the Great Leap Forward in production. After the young workers in the second workshop of Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory participated in multi-trade technical learning, they were originally short of 176 technical workers. Now, not only are they not short, but they have also transferred 14 workers to support other units. Young employees in the Chongqing construction industry recently launched a movement to manufacture 100 items of equipment, proposing the slogan of turning "construction sites into manufacturing plants, and turning users of machines and raw materials into manufacturers." They have all initially been able to manufacture many important equipment needed for construction, such as wind drills, motors, and electric welding machines.

Under the conditions that employees have mastered multi-trade skills and are learning multi-trade skills, many construction units are running satellite factories on a large scale. Chongqing Zhongliangshan Coal Mine Construction Engineering Company, Southwest Fourth Construction Company, and Chongqing Second Construction Company are currently operating and preparing to operate 35 satellite factories, which are expected to produce 258 machines and self-made explosives and other products within the year.

    适应社会主义建设大跃进的需要
    人人要成多才多艺的“多面手”
    重庆市四万名青年工人学会了多种技术
    本报重庆10日电　记者平兰报道：重庆市5月份提出“精一求多，开展多工种技术学习”的活动后，大大激发了青年工人成为“多面手”的热情。
    目前，钢铁、机械、建筑三个系统就有四万个青年工人参加了这项活动，占这些部门青工总人数的80％以上。这些青年经过短时期的苦钻苦学，一般都掌握了两、三种技术，有的学会技术九、十种之多。他们学习的方法多采用与老师傅订教学合同，也有青工之间互教互学，父子之间、夫妻之间互教互学的；他们还采用现场讲授、开训练班等多种学习方式，尽快地多学几门手艺。
    许多单位认为开展多工种技术学习主要有以下三个好处：
    第一、这是迅速培养工人阶级自己的技术队伍的重要方法。重庆市青年工人占职工总人数的30％以上，把多工种技术学习活动持久地开展下去，就能培养出大批技术骨干。如全国著名先进生产者黄荣昌，原来也不过是一个普通青年木工，当他学会了车、钳、刨、铣等技术以后，已成为全厂职工最欢迎的技师。
    第二、迅速推动了技术革命运动的开展。目前风起云涌的技术革新能手，大多是具备多方面的技术知识的。他们在精通一项技术的同时，还学习和掌握多种技术，“精”与“多”互相影响，思想窍门大开，便能发挥无穷无尽的创造性。例如重庆长安机器厂青年检验工人魏高厚，原来一项技术也不能掌握。今年3月以来，由于他同时拜四个师傅，学习多种技术，边学技术，边改进技术，现在基本上已能掌握七种技术，提出了两百多条技术革新建议。最近，他将铣床的垫圈原用钳工加工办法改成滚光机加工，提高了工效三万多倍，被全厂职工称赞为“智多星”。重庆狮子滩发电站的苏并诚青年突击队，原来只是架线突击队，现在可以做钢筋、混凝土、土石方、运转等九个工种，每个工种都能突破定额。目前已被这个单位的共青团委正式命名为“万能突击队”。
    第三、可以解决生产大跃进中出现的机器设备、原材料供应及技术力量等新的不平衡的矛盾。重庆长安机器厂第二车间的青年工人参加了多工种技术学习以后，原来差一百七十六个技术工人，现在不仅不差，还抽调了十四个工人支援别的单位。重庆市建筑业青年职工，最近发起了一个制造一百项器材运动，提出把“建筑工地变成制造厂，把机器和原料的使用者变为制造者”的口号。许多建筑上需要的重要器材如风钻、电动机、电焊机等，他们已都初步能够自己制造。
    在职工掌握了多工种技术和学习多工种技术的条件下，不少建筑业单位大办卫星工厂。重庆中梁山煤矿建筑工程公司、西南第四建筑公司、重庆市第二建筑公司等三个单位，目前便已办和正在办三十五个卫星工厂，预计在年内生产二百五十八部机器和自制炸药等产品。
