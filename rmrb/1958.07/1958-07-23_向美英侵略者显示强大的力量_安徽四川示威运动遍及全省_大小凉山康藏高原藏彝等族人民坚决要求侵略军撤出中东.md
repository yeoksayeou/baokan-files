Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 22nd: In recent days, people from all walks of life in Anhui Province have held various gatherings to strongly protest the crimes of US-British imperialism in armed aggression against the Middle East. This powerful demonstration movement has rapidly spread from cities to the vast rural areas of the province.

On the evening of the 17th, Hefei City first held a rally attended by more than 200,000 people, followed by a demonstration. The demonstrators carried various placards, angrily shouting slogans such as "Oppose the US armed aggression against Lebanon!" and "American troops get out of our Taiwan!". Zhang Kaifan, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and Vice Governor of Anhui Province, said in his speech at the meeting that the people of Anhui Province, together with the people of the whole country and peace-loving people all over the world, resolutely oppose the US-British imperialist aggression and war provocations in the Middle East. He pointed out that the just struggle of the Arab people will surely be victorious. Representatives from all walks of life in Anhui Province, Du Bingnan, Yu Yanong, Zheng Zhongyi, Zhou Zhijun, Yang Zhelun, and others spoke at the meeting, severely condemning the aggression of US-British imperialism. After the meeting, 200,000 people held a large-scale demonstration.

Wuhu, Anqing, Bengbu, Ma'anshan, Huainan, Tongguanshan City, Fuyang, Lu'an and other places have also held protest rallies in recent days. Workers, farmers, students, government cadres, and street residents who participated in the meetings all expressed their resolute demand that the US-British aggressor troops immediately withdraw from the Middle East with unparalleled anger. There were large-scale rallies in various places. More than 200,000 people participated in the protest rally in Bengbu City, more than 60,000 in Anqing and Huainan City respectively, more than 40,000 in Wuhu City, and more than 70,000 in Ma'anshan City. Subsequently, the demonstration movement rapidly developed to various county towns and vast rural areas throughout the province. On the 19th and 20th alone, in Bengbu Prefecture, twelve counties and fifty-nine larger market towns, including Su County, Xiao County, Chu County, Jiashan, Lai'an, Fengyang, Suixi, Dingyuan, Si County, Dangshan, Wuhe, and Huaiyuan, held protest rallies. More than 300,000 people attended the rallies, and more than one million people listened to the live broadcast of the protest rallies. Now, this demonstration movement against US-British imperialist aggression is continuing to develop in depth throughout the province.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 21st: In recent days, people in various small and medium-sized cities and remote areas of Sichuan have held many gatherings to protest the armed aggression of US and British imperialism against the Middle East.

Many counties and cities in Nanchong, Neijiang, Yibin, Ya'an, Xichang, Wenjiang and other regions have held mass rallies or forums. The broad masses of workers in the Sichuan oil area, which is under construction, immediately launched various protest activities after hearing the news of US and British imperialist armed aggression against the Middle East. Workers of the Dacheng Petroleum Drilling Team of the Central Sichuan Mining Bureau held a protest rally in the rain, and drilling workers who were several miles away from the team also rushed to participate. After the meeting, many people flocked to the rostrum to submit protest letters and rushed to sign their names on the rostrum, expressing their firm opposition to the aggressive actions of US and British imperialism. When more than 1,700 workers from the Nanchong Drilling Brigade held a protest rally, the workers warned the imperialists not to play with fire and burn themselves. They said that they would complete the drilling of twenty key exploratory wells by the end of July so that the central Sichuan oil area could produce more oil as soon as possible to increase the country's strength to defend peace.

All the revolutionary disabled veterans living in the Sichuan Veterans School Sanatorium in Xinfan County said in their protest letter against the US-British imperialist aggression: We still wear the medals for defeating the US military in the war against US aggression and aid Korea. The embarrassed appearance of the US aggressor army after being severely hit in Heartbreak Ridge and Shangganling in Korea is still vivid in our minds. If imperialism does not get out of Lebanon and Jordan, they will suffer the same disastrous defeat as on the Korean battlefield.

The broad masses of farmers in various places also expressed their firm protests against US and British imperialism. The Yi and Tibetan people in remote areas such as Xichang, Liangshan, and Aba also held many protest rallies. Xichang held a demonstration of 17,000 people on the 20th. The masses shouted slogans such as "US and British imperialism get out of Lebanon and Jordan!" and "Get out of our Taiwan!".

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 22nd: From the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains to the Kangzang Plateau, the anger against US-British imperialist aggression against the Middle East has spread like wildfire; the Tibetan, Yi and other ethnic groups in Sichuan Province have launched a powerful demonstration movement in recent days to protest the war provocations of US-British imperialism in the Middle East.

In Zhaojue, the capital of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, on the 20th, more than 3,000 people excitedly shouted the Yi people's unique "haozi" to demonstrate to the enemy, pouring into the square from all directions to participate in rallies and parades. Governor Wazhamuji of the Autonomous Prefecture sternly condemned the aggressive actions of US-British imperialism at the protest rally, calling on the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture to heighten their vigilance and strengthen the country's strength to defend peace a hundredfold. The masses in Meigu, Puxiong, Yuexi and other counties in the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains held protest rallies, and Yi farmers in various places expressed their full support for the just struggle of the Arab people.

In Kangding, the capital of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, a mass rally of more than 6,000 people was held today. Workers and farmers of all ethnic groups demanded at the meeting that the US-British aggressor troops immediately get out of the Middle East and expressed their readiness to contribute to the defense of peace. The drivers of the First Team of the Autonomous Prefecture Transportation Bureau, who regularly drive in the Erlang Mountain and Que'er Mountain areas, stated that they would strive to complete the production targets for 1959 ahead of schedule during this year's National Day, transport more and faster, and increase the country's strength to defend peace. Prior to this, people from all walks of life in Kangding had held many forums to condemn the aggressive crimes of US-British imperialism.
