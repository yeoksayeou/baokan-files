Xinhua News Agency, 11th — Ambassador Lubusang of the People's Republic of Mongolia held a grand reception this evening to mark the 37th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution.

Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi and Ambassador Lubusang spoke at the reception, hailing the victory of great Marxism-Leninism in Mongolia and the ever-strengthening unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China, extended warm fraternal congratulations to the Government and people of the People's Republic of Mongolia.

Chen Yi said that the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, holding high the red banner of proletarian internationalism, have continuously striven to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and have waged a resolute struggle against modern revisionism in order to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism. In recent years, the foreign relations of the People's Republic of Mongolia have seen new development, and the People's Republic of Mongolia has made contributions to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

Chen Yi said that the people of China and Mongolia have a traditional friendship, and the economic and cultural cooperation between China and Mongolia is constantly expanding. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the Chinese government and people for the donation of 15,000 saddle-horses by the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Government of the People's Republic of Mongolia this March to support China's agricultural construction.

Ambassador Lubusang said at the beginning of the reception that Mongolia, which was backward not long ago, is now advancing confidently along the socialist road. In the years since the revolution, the total number of livestock in the People's Republic of Mongolia has increased several times. Young industry is also developing rapidly, with industrial output accounting for 41% of the country's total agricultural, pastoral, and industrial output. Today, Mongolia's industry produces in one day what it produced in the entire year of 1930.

Ambassador Lubusang said that all these achievements are the result of the wise policy of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, guided by the great Marxist-Leninist theory, the result of the selfless fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union, and the result of the tenacious and creative labor of the people of the People's Republic of Mongolia.

Ambassador Lubusang also spoke of Mongolia's peaceful foreign policy and the close friendship between the brotherly Mongolian and Chinese peoples. He said that our country attaches great importance to further consolidating the unity of socialist countries, and will further consolidate and strengthen political, economic, and cultural cooperation with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all people's democratic countries.

Vice Premier Chen Yi and Ambassador Lubusang repeatedly toasted the prosperity and strength of China and Mongolia, the unbreakable friendship between the two peoples, and the health of Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Sambu of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia, as well as other leaders of the two countries.

Among the more than 700 guests of Ambassador Lubusang today were Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman Zhang Zhizhong of the National Defense Council, Vice Foreign Minister Zeng Yongquan, people from all walks of life in the capital, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.
