Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26th. Harbin Industrial Goods School, implementing the correct policy of "education serving politics, combining teaching with labor," has created a "one-stop" teaching experience that combines factory production, warehouse management, and store sales. This fundamentally changed the past closed-door schooling and established a red banner for commercial schools to practice diligence and thrift in study. The First and Second Commercial Ministries recently held an on-site meeting at this school to promote its experience.

The school offers two specialties: general merchandise and cultural goods. Students are all employees of commercial departments. The basic content of its "one-stop" teaching experience is: running its own factories, establishing experimental warehouses, and practice stores; going to the factory to learn about the commodity production process and inviting technicians to lecture; going to the warehouse to learn about transportation, storage, and quality appraisal and inviting warehouse managers to be teachers; going to the store to learn about varieties and patterns and taking salespersons as teachers.

Currently, this commercial school has opened a bacterial fertilizer factory and a rayon factory, and has established eight processing and repair groups for photography, clocks and watches, musical instruments, radios, stationery and paper, and daily-use chemicals. At the same time, it has established cooperative relationships with more than 20 related factories and enterprises, such as Harbin Department Store, Cultural Wholesale Station, Harbin Golden Pen Factory, Battery Factory, and Aluminum Products Production Cooperative. Technicians, engineers, and skilled workers from factories and enterprises set aside time to lecture students and provide learning materials. The school identifies commodity quality for factories and makes suggestions for improving product quality. This not only enriches the teaching content, links theory with practice, and exercises and improves the skills of teachers and students in commodity inspection, repair, and installation, but also helps the production departments improve product quality. According to preliminary statistics, this term's students have generally mastered the sensory appraisal skills of 70 kinds of commodities and the physical and chemical appraisal skills of 82 kinds of commodities. Students generally reflect: "This kind of learning truly solves practical problems."

The school has built an experimental warehouse, and teachers and students take turns going to the warehouse to work, moving relevant commodity maintenance and quality appraisal courses to the warehouse for lectures. Warehouse keepers also pass on their years of accumulated experience to the students. The students listen to lectures and operate at the same time, understanding thoroughly. They not only learn the theory, but also become familiar with the procedures for commodities entering and leaving the warehouse, and master the methods of increasing warehouse capacity and stacking techniques. Teachers and students going to the warehouse also solved many problems for the warehouse. Commodity science teachers provided methods for the "scientific management of commodity maintenance," such as proposing the use of para-nitrophenol to prevent mold growth on leather shoes, solving a problem that the warehouse had not solved for a long time. Physical and chemical teachers, in order to "realize semi-mechanization of the warehouse," created various machines to reduce heavy manual labor, such as "two-layer stacking racks" and "cargo transport belts" together with warehouse workers, changing the appearance of warehouse transportation. Policy theory teachers also compiled a study manual for warehouse keepers and came up with various ways to simplify procedures. Warehouse personnel believe that the school has brought them science and culture.

With the consent of the Provincial Department of Commerce, the school also uses Hexing Road Department Store as a practice store. Teachers and students use their spare time to participate in business at the store, taking salespersons as teachers, and becoming familiar with commodity varieties and patterns in the process of commodity sales. This not only reviews and consolidates theoretical knowledge, but also helps to discover problems existing in teaching. Students reflect that this practice is "seeing the book, seeing the object, and seeing the people," so the teaching quality has been greatly improved. Teachers and students going to the store also played a role in promoting the improvement of the store's business management and service quality, making the system of no full-time managers, open sales, and group amount nuclear standard more perfect. Teachers and students often explain commodity performance and help customers choose commodities through sales, which is very popular with customers. In order to help the store train all-round salespersons, the school also opened a commodity refresher school for the store. Salespersons use the time when teachers and students go to the store for practice to go to the school to learn commodity knowledge. Salespersons reflect that this is "an old ox entering a vegetable field, truly quenching thirst."

Harbin Industrial Goods School, in the past, due to insufficient clarity in the school-running policy, weak political and ideological leadership, and relatively chaotic thinking among teachers and students, generally existed the idea of ​​despising manual labor, emphasizing ostentation, and seeking extravagance, and the educational ideology of the bourgeoisie was also very strong. After the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the ideological awareness of teachers and students in the school has generally improved. In the Double-Anti Movement, the school's Party organization mobilized the masses to concentrate on criticizing bourgeois school-running ideas and teaching methods that were divorced from reality, such as not formulating teaching plans based on the characteristics of cadres, "managing teaching but not managing skills," "teaching books but not teaching people," and "seeing books but not seeing objects." After the Central Committee put forward the "Three Diligences" policy, the school leadership further examined conservative thinking and organized teachers to launch a major debate on teaching ideas, letting them go deep into the classes to listen to students' opinions on teaching. Students used concrete facts to criticize the views of teaching that was divorced from politics, divorced from production, and teaching for the sake of teaching. This enabled the "Three Diligences" policy to be implemented.

Practice has proven that the practice of Harbin Industrial Goods School shows that diligence and thrift in study is the correct path to linking theory with practice. Only by implementing the policy of diligence and thrift in study can commercial schools make a great leap forward. Diligence and thrift in study can further consolidate and develop the cooperative relationship between schools and enterprises, so as to help each other and promote each other. Their experience also shows that through diligence and thrift in study, a lot of material wealth can be produced, which is in line with the principle of "spending less money and doing more things, doing things without spending money," and it also helps to cultivate cadres in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

    勤工俭学的一面红旗
    哈尔滨工业商品学校创“一条龙”教学经验
    新华社哈尔滨26日电　哈尔滨工业商品学校贯彻“教育为政治服务，教学与劳动结合”的正确方针，创造了与工厂生产、仓库保管、商店销售三结合的“一条龙”的教学经验，根本上改变了过去关门办学的面貌，为商业学校实行勤工俭学树立了一面红旗。第一、第二商业部最近在这个学校召开现场会议，推广它的经验。
    这个学校设有百货商品和文化用品商品两个专业，学员都是商业部门的职工。它的“一条龙”教学经验的基本内容是：自己开办工厂，建立试验仓库和实习商店；要学习商品生产过程就去工厂，请技术员讲课；要学习运输、保管、品质鉴定就去仓库，请保管员当老师；要学习花色品种就去商店，拜营业员为师。
    现在，这个商业学校开办了细菌肥料厂、人造纤维厂，成立了照相、钟表、乐器、收音机、文具纸张、日用化学等八个加工修理小组，同时和哈尔滨百货、文化批发站、哈尔滨金笔厂、电池厂、铝制品生产合作社等二十多个有关工厂、企业建立协作关系。工厂、企业的技术员、技师、熟练工人抽出时间给学员讲课，供给学习资料。学校为工厂鉴定商品质量，提出提高产品质量的建议。这不仅丰富了教学内容，使理论联系实际，锻炼和提高了师生对于商品检验、修配、安装的技能，而且对生产部门改进产品质量也有帮助。据初步统计，本期学员一般已掌握了七十种商品的感官鉴定技能和八十二种商品的理化鉴定技能。学员普遍反映：“这样学习才真正解决实际问题”。
    学校搞了试验仓库，师生们分批轮流下仓库劳动，并将有关商品养护、质量鉴定课程搬到仓库去讲。保管员也把多年积累下来的经验传授给学员。学员们边听讲边操作，理解深透，既学得了理论，也熟悉了商品出入库手续制度，掌握了提高仓容办法和堆码技术等。师生下仓库，也给仓库解决了许多问题。商品学教师为“商品养护科学化”提供了方法，如提出用对位硝基酚防止皮鞋长毛，解决了仓库长期没有解决的问题。理化教师们为“仓库实现半机械化”，同仓库职工一道创造“二层垛架”、“运货拖拉带”等多种减轻重体力劳动的器械，改变了仓库运输面貌。政策理论教师也为仓库编写保管员学习手册，想出各种办法简化了手续制度。仓库人员认为，学校给他们带来了科学和文化。
    学校经过省商业厅同意，又以和兴路百货商店作为实习商店。师生们利用业余时间到商店参加营业，拜营业员为师，在商品销售过程中熟悉商品花色品种。这样，不但复习和巩固了理论知识，还有助于发现教学中存在的问题。学员们反映，这种做法是“见书、见物又见人”，教学质量因而大大提高。师生下商店，对商店的经营管理的改善和服务质量的提高也起了促进作用，使商店推行的无专职管理人员、敞开售货、小组金额核标等制度更加完善。师生通过售货经常向顾客解释商品性能和帮助挑选商品，深受顾客欢迎。为了帮助商店培养全能售货员，学校还为商店开办了商品进修学校，营业员利用师生去商店实习的时间，到学校学习商品知识。营业员反映这是“老牛进菜地，真解渴”。
    哈尔滨工业商品学校，过去由于对办学的方针不够明确，政治思想领导薄弱，师生思想比较混乱，普遍存在着轻视体力劳动、讲排场、图阔气的思想，资产阶级的教育思想也很浓厚，经过整风和反右派斗争，学校师生的思想觉悟普遍提高了。在双反运动中，学校党组织发动群众集中地批判了不根据干部特点制定教学计划，“管教不管会”，“教书不教人”，“见书不见物”等资产阶级办学思想和理论脱离实际的教学方法。在中央“三勤”方针提出后，学校领导上进一步检查了保守思想，并组织教师展开教学思想上的大辩论，让他们深入到班级中去听取学员对教学的意见。学员用具体事实批判了教学脱离政治、脱离生产、为教学而教学的观点。这样就使“三勤”方针得到贯彻。
    实践已经证明：哈尔滨工业商品学校的做法，说明了勤工俭学是理论联系实际的正确道路。只有贯彻勤工俭学的方针，商业学校才能够大跃进，勤工俭学可以把学校与企业之间的协作关系进一步巩固与发展起来，做到互相帮助，互相促进。他们的经验还说明，通过勤工俭学，可以生产不少物质财富，符合“少花钱多办事，不花钱也办事”的原则，而且也有助于多、快、好、省地培养干部。
