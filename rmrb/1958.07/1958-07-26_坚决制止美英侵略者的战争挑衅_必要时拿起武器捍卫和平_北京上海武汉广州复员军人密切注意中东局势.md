Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: More than 100,000 demobilized soldiers in the capital who are engaged in peaceful construction have held rallies in recent days to strongly protest the armed interference of American and British imperialism in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. They stated that they would never stand idly by in the face of the aggressors' war provocations.

The demobilized soldiers are all very indignant at the aggressive actions of American and British imperialism. They all used their personal experiences on the Korean battlefield to expose American and British imperialism as nothing more than two paper tigers that appear strong but are weak inside. Yu Yinghuan, a demobilized soldier who defended the Shangganling position and inflicted heavy casualties on the invading army and now a student at Beijing Industrial School, said: The U.S. Marine Corps First Division, which was utterly defeated by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, has invaded Lebanon again. If this so-called "ace" unit of the United States hadn't escaped quickly at Changjin Lake, it would have been completely wiped out long ago. Li Laixiang, who now works at the Jiaodaokou Hospital in Beijing, served as a political instructor of a company in the Volunteer Army during the fourth campaign in Korea. He said: The American army is a pushover that collapses as soon as it is hit. Luo Wuchang, a seventeen-year-old messenger in our company, captured three fully armed American soldiers in a mountain gully near Hengcheng without firing a single bullet. Na Guangduo, a driver for the Capital Automobile Company, said: Once, on a hill near the Han River, our brave and resourceful cooks, Peng Guoqing and Hu Tongfu, forced four American soldiers to surrender obediently.

The demobilized soldiers also used facts they witnessed to accuse the American invading army of being the most brutal and savage robbers in the world. Yan Zejun, a worker at the Beijing Wire Factory who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, said angrily: The American invading army killed countless children and women in Korea. The invaders' planes dropped many toy explosives. The ignorant Korean children thought they were real toys and were blown to death. Feng Ruizhi, a female student at Beijing Industrial School, said that the American invading army destroyed many cities and villages in Korea with bombs and shells, killing countless peaceful residents. Now it is trying to impose the disaster of war on the people of the Middle East, which we will never allow. They stated that they would be a hundred times more vigilant, and if American and British imperialism does not stop its aggression, they will return to the front lines.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 25th: Demobilized soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Shanghai, who once battered the American invading army on the Korean battlefield, have recently held rallies to angrily condemn the American and British aggressors for continuing to send troops to the Middle East and frantically preparing to expand their aggression. They also seriously warned the aggressors: If they do not immediately lay down their butcher knives and get out of the Middle East, these soldiers who defend peace will take up arms again when necessary.

The demobilized Volunteer Army officers and soldiers greatly despise the paper tigers of the American and British invading armies, which were once defeated by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies in Korea. Wang Renkun, now a fitter at the Dalong Machinery Factory, said that during the so-called "Autumn Offensive" clamored by Van Fleet in 1951, their company defended its position for fourteen days, repelling countless frantic attacks by the enemy under the cover of powerful air force and artillery fire, and finally beat the enemy until they abandoned a large number of corpses and fled in panic. Wang Renkun said: The American invading army is very afraid of death. Every time they went into battle, they were like ducks being herded, timid and shrinking back. If someone wasn't supervising them from behind, no one would dare to move forward. How could such an army not be defeated?

Xue Renyi, a former Volunteer Army Air Force soldier who now works for the fishing fleet of the Shanghai Aquatic Products Company, used his personal experience to describe how the American aggressors' air force was also a paper tiger that bullied the weak and feared the strong. He said that at the beginning, these aerial bandits were very rampant, often flying low to bomb and strafe peaceful Korean residents. However, when our air force quickly grew stronger in combat and killed its "ace pilot," Davis, it no longer dared to be rampant and constantly issued cries that its "air superiority" was over. Wang Renkun said: Imperialism will not admit defeat unless it suffers a heavy blow. The Korean armistice negotiations dragged on for several years. After we broke through the enemy's heavily defended positions in one day and night during the summer counterattack in July 1953, expanding the area of ​​the position by 170 square kilometers and annihilating more than 26,000 enemies, the American aggressors were forced to obediently sign the armistice agreement.

Now, former Volunteer Army officers and soldiers in Shanghai are closely watching the development of the situation in the Middle East. They said that we are always prepared and never complacent. Although we are now building our motherland with peaceful labor in different positions, if necessary, we will not hesitate to take up arms again and fight bravely against aggression and to defend peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 25th: In Wuhan, tens of thousands of demobilized and transferred soldiers have held rallies in recent days, angrily protesting the aggression of American and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan. In their speeches, they unanimously stated that they would never stand idly by in the face of the aggressors' war provocations.

These demobilized and transferred soldiers all participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. They used their personal experiences on the Korean battlefield to point out that the American and British aggressors are nothing more than two paper tigers struggling in their death throes. Xiao Shaowu, who now works at the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Housing Rental Station, was a heavy machine gunner in the Volunteer Army. Recalling their fight against the American aggressors, he said that the U.S. 7th Division was the U.S.'s "ace" army in World War II and also the "ace" army in the U.S. aggression against Korea, but our Volunteer Army defeated them in just a few rounds in Yunshan, Korea, annihilating more than 10,000 of them. On October 6, 1952, when we were defending position 394.8, the U.S. military sent two regiments, the British military sent one battalion, plus a division of Syngman Rhee, and they were all defeated by us. Once, we captured an American lieutenant colonel who said in alarm: "Your Volunteer Army's shells are like they have eyes, they chase us wherever we run, even if we have two more legs, we can't outrun you."

The demobilized and transferred soldiers also pointed out that we must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the heinous crimes of American and British aggression in the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 25th: Demobilized and transferred soldiers, families of revolutionary martyrs, and military dependents in Guangzhou have held rallies in recent days to condemn the crimes of American and British imperialism in the Middle East. As of yesterday, more than 10,000 families of martyrs, military dependents, and demobilized and transferred soldiers from three districts, including the Central District, Northern District, and Western District, and more than fifty factories, enterprises, and institutions, including the Xinghua Battery Factory, have held rallies and demonstrations.

Xu Qionghe, the wife of the revolutionary martyr and former member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party before the Great Revolution and director of the second session of the Guangzhou Peasant Movement Training Institute, Ruan Xiaoxian, who is already over sixty years old, was helped by others to participate in the Central District conference. She said at the meeting: The American and British imperialists are invading the Middle East and destroying human peace, which cannot be tolerated. She angrily shouted: American devils get out of the Middle East immediately!

At a rally held by more than 400 demobilized and transferred soldiers in the Western District, Chen Jiahui, a transferred soldier who won the title of first-class combat hero in the War of Liberation, said angrily: Our people have annihilated 8 million Chiang Kai-shek troops and defeated American imperialism in Korea. American and British imperialism's aggression in the Middle East will surely suffer a shameful defeat.

At rallies held in factories and enterprises, many demobilized and transferred soldiers also expressed their great anger at the American and British aggressors. Zhang Defang, a demobilized soldier who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, said: American imperialism was our defeated enemy in Korea. Now it is invading the Middle East, and we must not stand idly by. The 41 demobilized and transferred soldiers of the Xinghua Battery Factory wrote in a protest letter: We firmly stand with the Arab people and are always ready to give the enemy a serious blow.

    坚决制止美英侵略者的战争挑衅
    必要时拿起武器捍卫和平
    北京上海武汉广州复员军人密切注意中东局势
    新华社25日讯　在首都从事和平建设的十万多复员军人，连日来纷纷集会，强烈抗议美英帝国主义武装干涉中东各国人民的内政。他们表示，对侵略者的战争挑衅决不袖手旁观。
    复员军人们对美英帝国主义的侵略行为都非常愤慨。他们都用自己在朝鲜战场上的亲身经历，揭穿美英帝国主义不过是两只外强中干的纸老虎。曾经坚守上甘岭阵地给侵略军重大杀伤的复员军人、北京工业学校学生于英寰说：被中朝人民军队打得落花流水的美国海军陆战队第一师又侵略黎巴嫩去了。这支美国的所谓“王牌”部队在长津湖畔如果不是逃得快，早就被全部消灭了。现在北京市交道口医院工作的李来祥，在朝鲜的四次战役中担任过志愿军的连政治指导员。他说：美国军队是个脓包，一打就垮。我们连里一个十七岁的通讯员罗五昌，在横城附近的山沟里，没有费一颗子弹就活捉了三个全副武装的美国兵。首都汽车公司司机那广铎说：有一次，在汉江附近的山头上，我们英勇机智的炊事员彭国庆、胡同福，逼使四个美国兵乖乖地作了俘虏。
    复员军人们还以他们目睹的事实，控诉美国侵略军是世界上最残暴的最野蛮的强盗。曾经参加抗美援朝战争的北京有线电厂工人颜泽钧愤怒地说：美国侵略军在朝鲜杀害了无数的儿童和妇女，侵略者的飞机空投下许多玩具爆炸物，不懂事的朝鲜儿童以为是真的玩具，结果被活活炸死。北京工业学校女学生冯瑞芝说，美国侵略军在朝鲜用炸弹、炮弹破坏了许多城市、乡村，杀死了无数和平居民。现在它又企图把战争的灾难强加给中东人民，我们绝不允许。他们表示：要百倍地提高警惕，如果美英帝国主义不停止侵略，他们将重返前线。
    新华社上海25日电　当年在朝鲜战场上把美国侵略军打得头破血流的中国人民志愿军在上海的复员军人最近纷纷集会，愤怒谴责美英侵略者继续增兵中东，狂热准备扩大侵略的罪恶活动，并且严重警告侵略者：如不立即放下屠刀，滚出中东，在必要时，他们这些保卫和平的战士将重新拿起武器。
    复员的志愿军官兵们十分蔑视当年在朝鲜被朝中人民军队打得狼狈不堪的美英侵略军这些纸老虎。现在大隆机器厂做钳工的王仁坤说，在1951年范佛里特叫嚣的所谓
  “秋季攻势”中，他们一个连坚守阵地十四天，打垮了在强大空军和炮火掩护下的敌人的无数次疯狂进攻，最后打得敌人丢下大批尸体狼狈溃逃。王仁坤说：美国侵略军非常贪生怕死，每次上阵都像赶鸭子一样，畏畏缩缩，要不是有人在后面督战，谁也不敢向前，这样的军队，怎能不打败仗呢？
    原志愿军空军战士、现在上海水产公司渔轮队工作的薛仁义用亲身经历叙述了美国侵略者的空军也是欺软怕硬的纸老虎，他说，开始，这些空中强盗很猖狂，经常低飞轰炸扫射朝鲜和平居民。但是，当我们的空军飞快地在战斗中壮大起来，并且把它的“王牌驾驶员”戴维斯也打死了的时候，它就再也不敢猖狂，而且不断发出“空中优势”完蛋的哀鸣了。王仁坤说：帝国主义不遭到沉重打击是不会认输的。朝鲜停战谈判拖了几年，等到我们在1953年7月夏季反击战中，一昼夜间突破了敌军坚固设防的阵地，扩展阵地面积一百七十平方公里，歼灭敌人二万六千多名之后，美国侵略者就被迫乖乖地在停战协定上签字了。
    现在，在上海的原志愿军官兵正严密地注视着中东局势的发展。他们说，我们时刻准备着，丝毫也不麻痹。现在，我们虽然在不同的岗位上以和平的劳动建设我们的祖国，但是，如果有需要，我们将毫不迟疑地重新拿起武器，为反对侵略、保卫和平而英勇战斗。
    新华社武汉25日电　在武汉的上万名复员转业军人连日来纷纷集会，愤怒抗议美英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩和约旦。他们在发言中一致表示，对侵略者的战争挑衅决不袖手旁观。
    这些复员转业军人都参加过抗美援朝战争。他们用自己在朝鲜战场上的亲身经历，指出美英侵略者不过是进行垂死挣扎的两只纸老虎。现在在武汉长江大桥经租站工作的萧少武，原是志愿军的一名重机枪射手。他回忆他们打击美国侵略者的情景说，美军第七师是美国在第二次世界大战中的“王牌”军队，也是美国侵略朝鲜的“王牌”军队，但是我们志愿军在朝鲜云山只几个回合就打垮了他们，消灭了他们一万多人。1952年10月6日，我们在保卫三九四点八阵地时，美军出动了两个团，英军出动了一个营，外加李承晚一个师，结果都被我们打垮了。有一次，我们捉到一个美军中校，他惊惶地说：“你们志愿军的炮弹像长了眼睛似的，我们逃到那里它就追到那里，再长两条腿也跑不过你们。”
    复员转业军人们同时指出，对美英侵略中东的滔天罪行，一定要保持高度警惕。
    新华社广州25日电　广州市复员转业军人和烈、军属连日举行集会，声讨美、英帝国主义侵略中东的罪行。到昨日止，已有中区、北区、西区等三个区和兴华电池厂等五十多个工厂、企业、机关单位的一万多烈、军属和复员转业军人分别举行了集会和示威游行。
    革命先烈的家属、大革命前的中共中央委员兼广州第二期农民讲习所所长阮啸仙的夫人徐琼荷，已经六十多岁了，她叫别人扶着参加了中区的大会。她在会上说：美、英帝国主义侵略中东，破坏人类的和平，这决不能容忍。她愤怒地高呼：美国鬼立即从中东滚出去！
    在西区四百多复员转业军人举行的集会上，曾在解放战争中得过一等战斗英雄称号的转业军人陈家辉愤怒地说：我国人民消灭过八百万蒋军，在朝鲜打败过美帝国主义，美英帝国主义侵略中东必定遭到可耻的失败。
    在工厂、企业单位举行的集会上，许多复员转业军人也都对美英侵略者表示无比愤怒。曾经参加过抗美援朝战争的复员军人张德芳说：美帝国主义在朝鲜是我们的手下败将。现在它侵略中东，我们决不能袖手旁观。兴华电池厂四十一名复员转业军人在抗议书中写道：我们坚决和阿拉伯人民站在一起，时刻准备着给敌人以严重的打击。
