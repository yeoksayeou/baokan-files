Indigenous Methods Yield More Oil
Rapid Development of Sichuan's Petroleum Industry
(Our dispatch from Chongqing) Party committees at all levels in Sichuan are implementing the policy of "the whole people running the petroleum industry," relying on the masses to refine oil using indigenous methods, and promoting the rapid development of the petroleum industry. Sichuan is rich in petroleum resources. In addition to the central Sichuan oil region, oil has also been discovered in Yongchuan, Jiangyou, Yuechi, Luxian, Daxian, Baxian, Qionglai, and other places. However, in the past, some people believed that the oil production in these places was small and not worth exploiting. Therefore, two months ago, there was only one oil refinery in Sichuan, located in Chongqing, that used coal tar as raw material.

In March of this year, after criticizing the idea of "only running large-scale operations and not small-scale ones," the engineering, technical, and management personnel of the Sichuan Petroleum Administration Bureau eliminated the mystified view of building a petroleum industry. First, a refining pot capable of processing 1,000 tons of crude oil per year was built next to an oil well in Nanchong. There were no factory buildings or new equipment, and the operation was simple. Workers carried the crude oil and poured it into the pot, using residual oil residue as fuel. As long as attention was paid to the refining temperature and time, various types of oil could be produced. This indigenous oil refining technique quickly attracted attention from various places, and people were sent to learn it. Now, various forms of indigenous oil refineries have emerged in the province. The Nanchong Prefectural Industrial and Transportation Bureau obtained discarded boilers from factories and made two refining pots with annual processing capacities of 1,500 tons and 300 tons, respectively. They were set up next to the oil wells in Longnüsi and Nanchong to refine oil. Recently, this bureau also used three oil drums connected in series to refine oil. The upper oil drum produced gasoline, the middle one kerosene, and the lower one diesel. Initial trials have been successful. Even more frugal was Drilling Team 1209, which, after drilling for crude oil in Daxing Township, Guang'an County, dug an earthen stove, borrowed two iron pots from farmers used for cooking pig feed, and a large wooden bucket, and refined oil without spending a penny. Now, many prefectures are adopting indigenous oil refining methods to accelerate the pace of petroleum construction.

In accordance with the spirit of combining large, medium, and small-scale operations and the whole people running the petroleum industry, the Sichuan Petroleum Administration Bureau actively supports the construction of local petroleum industries. It has decided to hand over the shallow oil wells in Longnüsi and Jiangyou to local production and supply some of the crude oil from the central Sichuan oil region to local small oil refineries for processing. This year, it is designing an oil refinery with an annual processing capacity of 9,000 tons for the Suining Prefecture. At the same time, it has printed a batch of blueprints for small oil refineries that agricultural cooperatives have the capacity to build. This year, the bureau will help nine counties and cities develop local petroleum industries.

    土法炼油出油多
    四川石油工业发展快
    本报重庆电　四川各级党委贯彻全民办石油的方针，依靠群众用土法炼油，促进石油工业的迅速发展。四川石油资源丰富，除了川中油区外，在永川、江油、岳池、泸县、达县、巴县、邛崃等地都发现了石油。但是过去有些人认为这些地方的石油产量小，不值得开采。因此两个月以前四川境内只有重庆市有一座以煤焦油为原料的炼油厂。
    今年3月，四川石油管理局工程技术和管理人员批判了“办大不办小”的思想后，破除了建设石油工业的神秘观点。首先在南充喷油井旁边建立了一座年处理原油一千吨的炼油锅，没有厂房，也没有什么新式设备，而且操作简单，工人们把原油挑来倒在锅里，用残余油渣作燃料，只要注意炼油的温度和时间，就能炼出各种油来。这种土法炼油的技术很快就引起了各地的重视，纷纷派人来学习。现在省内出现了各种形式的土法炼油厂。南充专署工业交通局向工厂要来废旧锅炉，做了年处理一千五百吨、三百吨的炼油锅两台。分别设在龙女寺和南充的喷油井旁炼油。这个局最近又用了三只油桶串连起来炼油，上边的油桶出汽油，中间的出煤油，下边的出柴油，并已初步试制成功。更节约的是1209钻井队，在广安县大兴乡钻出原油以后，挖个土灶，借了农民两口煮猪食的铁锅和一只大木桶，没花一分钱也炼出了油。现在不少专区纷纷采取土法炼油来加快石油建设的速度。
    四川石油管理局根据大中小结合、全民办石油的精神，积极支援地方石油工业建设，已决定将龙女寺和江油两个地区的浅油井交给地方生产，并将川中油区部分原油供给当地小油厂炼制。今年给遂宁专区设计一座年处理九千吨的炼油厂。同时晒印了一批一个农业社就有力量兴办的小油厂的图纸，这个局今年将帮助九个县、市发展地方石油工业。
