The Hu'er Cooperative in Yicheng County, Hubei Province, had four mu of broad beans, with an average yield of 1,333 jin per mu.

The broad beans of this cooperative, which achieved high yields, including these four mu, totaled fifty mu, with an average yield of 1,005 jin per mu, nearly double that of last year.

According to preliminary summaries, the reason why these fifty mu of broad beans achieved high yields was mainly due to the implementation of advanced deep plowing and close planting techniques, and sufficient fertilization.

    胡耳社蚕豆高产
    湖北省宜城县胡耳社有四亩蚕豆，平均亩产量达一千三百三十三斤。
    这个社获高额丰产的蚕豆，连同这四亩在内共有五十亩，平均亩产达一千零五斤，比去年提高近二倍。
    据初步总结，这五十亩蚕豆获得高额丰产的原因，主要是贯彻了深耕密植的先进技术，而且施肥充足。
