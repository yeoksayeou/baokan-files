Xinhua News Agency, 24th - At a meeting held today by more than 700 demobilized and transferred soldiers at the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, speakers used their own combat experiences to illustrate that Anglo-American imperialism is a paper tiger. They expressed that they will heighten their vigilance, be prepared at all times, defend the motherland, and defend world peace.

Many of the seven hundred demobilized and transferred soldiers in this factory participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. They are very concerned about the development of the Middle East situation and have held many meetings to protest the aggressive acts of Anglo-American imperialism.

At today's meeting, seven demobilized and transferred soldiers spoke. Cui Zhengyu, who fought against the US aggressors on the Korean battlefield for three years, said that in 1951, when negotiations with the US aggressors began in Panmunjom, the enemy's attitude was very arrogant. Later, we severely beat them and drove them south of the 38th parallel, and they obediently signed the armistice agreement. Technician Xu Qiqin said that in 1951, we shot down an American plane in Korea and captured a prisoner. The prisoner said that every time they set off, they had to pray to God, hoping that nothing would happen, and if the plane was hit, it was best not to be killed, and they would rather be taken prisoner. This is the air superiority that the United States boasts about. Test worker Su Shide said: "Why do the enemies always lose battles? In the words of the American prisoners themselves, they themselves don't know who they are fighting for. The prisoners all said that they were deceived by the American authorities into going to Korea. How can such a war not fail?"

The demobilized and transferred soldiers at the meeting also expressed that they would work hard to increase production in order to enhance the country's strength to defend peace. Mao Dongchang, a worker in the 12th workshop, said that their workshop recently proposed a slogan: "Make a big fuss about technical revolution, everyone suggests striving for a hundred suggestions," and their workshop of one hundred people put forward 945 rationalization proposals in one day, which greatly promoted production.

The protest letter passed at the meeting read: "We love peace and love the peaceful construction of the motherland, but we are never afraid of war, and we understand that peace is won through struggle. We firmly support the just struggle of the people of the Middle East, and we are always ready to fight!"

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 24th - More than 13,000 voluntary laborers and migrant workers at the Haihe River renovation site near the estuary of the Haihe River in Bohai Bay strongly protested against the armed aggression of Anglo-American imperialism in the Middle East and firmly supported the just struggle of the people of the Middle East.

The "Dongfeng Company" of migrant workers, entirely composed of demobilized soldiers, transferred soldiers, disabled soldiers, and backbone militia, were extremely angry after hearing the news of Anglo-American imperialist aggression in the Middle East. They held a meeting after their tense labor and strongly demanded that the Anglo-American imperialists immediately get out of the Middle East. Disabled soldier Guo Dexin said indignantly: We will never allow Anglo-American imperialism to destroy the peaceful life we ​​have earned with our blood. Peace-loving people have enough power to strike at all aggressors. In the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, we defeated Japanese militarism with millet and rifles. In the War of Liberation, the millions of troops of the Kuomintang reactionaries armed by American imperialism were also completely annihilated by us. Now that the world's peace forces are so strong, if Anglo-American imperialism does not turn back, those who play with fire will burn themselves.

Zhang Jianxi, a demobilized soldier who cooperated with the Volunteer Air Force Zhang Jiuhui to shoot down the American "ace" air force pilot Davis, said: I was particularly happy to hear that the Lebanese people shot down and injured several American planes! These facts show that US imperialism is nothing more than a paper tiger that looks strong but is actually weak. If they do not immediately get out of the Middle East, they will be beaten to death without a burial place by the Arab people.

    过去小米加步枪打败了日本
    今天更有力量维护世界和平
    北京天津部分复员军人用亲身经历证明美帝是纸老虎
    新华社24日讯　在北京电子管厂七百多名复员转业军人今天举行的集会上，发言的人都用自己亲身经历过的战斗，说明美英帝国主义是纸老虎。他们表示要提高警惕，时刻准备着，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平。
    这个厂的七百多复员转业军人中，有不少人参加过抗美援朝战争。他们非常关心中东局势的发展，曾多次集会抗议美英帝国主义的侵略行为。
    在今天的集会上，有七位复员转业军人讲了话。曾经在朝鲜战场上和美国侵略军打过三年仗的崔正余说，1951年在板门店开始和美国侵略军谈判时，敌人态度很蛮横。后来我们狠狠地打了它们，把敌人赶到三八线以南，它们就乖乖地在停战协定上签字了。技术员许圻钦说，1951年我们在朝鲜打下一架美国飞机，捉到了一个俘虏。那个俘虏说，他们每次出发都要向上帝祷告，希望不出事，一旦飞机被击中，也最好不被打死，情愿当俘虏。这就是美国吹嘘的空中优势。试验工苏世德说：“敌人为什么老打败仗呢？用美国俘虏自己的话说，就是他们自己也不知道为谁而战。俘虏们都说自己是被美国当局骗到朝鲜的。这样的战争怎么能不失败呢？”
    复员转业军人们在会上并表示要努力增加生产，以增强祖国保卫和平的力量，十二车间的工人茅东昌说，他们车间最近提出一个口号：“大闹技术革命，人人建议争百条”，他们车间一百人一天就提出了九百四十五条合理化建议，对生产起了很大推动作用。
    会上，通过的抗议书中写道：“我们热爱和平，热爱祖国的和平建设，但是我们从不畏惧战争，我们懂得和平是用斗争取来的。我们坚决支持中东人民的正义斗争，我们时刻准备着战斗！”
    新华社天津24日电　在渤海湾海河入口处附近，改造海河工地上的一万三千多名义务劳动大军和民工，强烈抗议美英帝国主义对中东的武装侵略，坚决支持中东人民正义斗争。
    全部由复员军人和转业军人、残废军人、基干民兵组成的“东风连”的民工队伍，听到美英帝国主义侵略中东的消息以后，十分愤怒。他们在紧张的劳动之后举行了集会，强硬要求美英帝国主义者立即从中东滚出去。残废军人郭德信激愤地说：决不允许美英帝国主义破坏我们用鲜血换来的和平生活。爱好和平的人民有足够的力量打击一切侵略者。在抗日战争中，我们用小米加步枪打败了日本军国主义者。解放战争中，由美帝国主义武装起来的国民党反动派几百万军队也被我们全部消灭。现在世界和平力量这样强大，美英帝国主义如死不回头，玩火者必将自焚。
    曾经配合志愿军空军张积慧打落美国“王牌”空军驾驶员戴维斯的志愿军复员军人张见喜说：听说黎巴嫩人民打落打伤好几架美国飞机，我感到特别高兴！这些事实说明美帝国主义不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎。如果不立即从中东滚出去，必将被阿拉伯人民打得死无葬身之地。
