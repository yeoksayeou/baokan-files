    A Major Technological Revolution in the Rubber Industry:
    Tires Made Without Water Bladders

    The Mudanjiang First Rubber Factory successfully trial-produced the world's first water bladder-free vulcanized automobile tire on July 2nd.

    Water bladders are an indispensable component for factories worldwide that use vulcanization tanks for production. When a tire is placed in a mold and heated for vulcanization, the bladder relies on water and steam to generate internal pressure within the tire casing. In the past, it was universally believed that without it, the tire would not have the desired tread pattern, and its physical properties would not meet standards. The factory's workers broke this long-standing method followed by countries around the world. They used rubber rings to seal the tire opening and directly injected water and air into the inside of the tire casing, allowing it to directly generate internal pressure. The first experiment was conducted on July 1st using scrap tires. The results, except for some air bubbles appearing where water and air penetrated the rubber holes, were completely up to standard. The Party Secretary, Factory Director, and engineers personally participated in the experiment and encouraged the workers to continue experimenting boldly. The workers summarized the experience and lessons learned from the first experiment. The next day, they eliminated the air bubbles, and the experiment was a success. After adopting water bladder-free vulcanization, the entire process of manufacturing, repairing, inspecting, installing, and removing water bladders in Workshop Three can be eliminated, saving more than forty workers. Based on an annual production of one million sets, approximately 800,000 yuan can be saved annually.

    They are now conducting experiments to eliminate inner tubes and rim tapes, and are preparing to conduct experiments to eliminate tire cords.

    橡胶工业一项重大的技术革命
    不用水胎制出了轮胎
    牡丹江第一橡胶厂在7月2日试制成功了世界上第一支无水胎硫化的汽车轮胎。
    水胎，是现在世界上用硫化罐生产的工厂所不可缺少的东西。当轮胎装进模子里加温硫化的时候，它靠着水和蒸汽，在外胎里产生内压作用。过去人们一向认为，离了它，轮胎就不会印出花纹，物理性能就不会合乎标准。这个厂的工人们打破了这个世界各国长期遵循的老办法。用胶圈堵住胎口，把水和气直接打进了外胎内部，使它直接发生内压作用。7月1日利用废胎进行第一次试验。结果，除了水、气钻进胶孔鼓起一些气泡以外，其他方面完全合乎标准。党委书记、厂长、工程师都亲自参加了试验，并鼓励工人大胆地继续进行试验。工人们总结了第一次试验的经验和教训。第二天就消灭了气泡，试验成功了。无水胎硫化采用以后，三车间的水胎制造、修理、检查、装进、扒出等工艺过程可全部取消，节约劳动力四十多名。按年产百万套计算，一年可节约八十万元左右。
  现在他们正在进行取消内胎、垫带的试验，并准备进行取消帘子线的试验。
