Introduction to Duck Raising Experience

Editor's Note: After Comrade Feng Xin's letter "Hope to Introduce Duck Raising Experience" was published in this newspaper on June 25, many readers sent letters introducing their own duck raising experiences. We have only selected a portion of them to publish here. At the same time, it should be pointed out that the experience in one area may not be entirely suitable for another area, and most of them are direct experiences and methods derived from actual feeding. Some experiences still need to be further enriched and developed in practice. We hope that when adopting these experiences, do not "copy mechanically." Be sure to combine them with your own experience and proceed from the local situation. As for general feeding experience and methods, it is best to refer to relevant professional books in this regard. Books such as "Experience in Raising Groups of Ducks" published by the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Publishing House, and "Beijing Duck Raising Method" published by Zhonghua Book Company, are all valuable for reference.

I used to raise ducks to make a living. Last year, I was a temporary incubation technician at the Changsha Wildlife Breeding Farm. In actual work, I realized some common knowledge about raising ducks, which I have written below for your reference.

To make ducks have a high reproduction rate and grow fast, and truly meet the requirements of developing production with more, faster, better, and more economical results, the first thing is to select good breeds. The selection criteria are: eyes bright and large, feathers oily and soft, close to the body, weight, tibia length, and full of energy.

The following types are not up to feeding standards: big belly, lame, small toes, blind eyes, and short beaks.

Twenty-four hours after the ducklings hatch, start feeding them rice. Wash the white rice until it's cool, chew it finely, and feed it to the ducklings to train them to eat. About four hours after the first feeding, feed them a second time, and then check each one by hand to see if they have eaten, to avoid starving the ducklings to death. Once they are taught to eat, feeding them three meals a day is enough. The feed should be adjusted: feed them duckweed once every other day, and after a full meal, feed them some chopped green aquatic grass. Every five or ten days, each duck can be fed some fresh chopped loach.

The duck shed should face south, be cool, and well-ventilated. The inside of the shed should be separated by bamboo strips every twenty to thirty ducks to prevent them from being crushed to death when it is cold and from getting feverish when it is hot. Pay attention to avoiding the heat when the weather is hot and the water temperature rises from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. every day.

The following points should be noted when ducklings go into the water for the first time: Find a place with a shallow flowing water no more than three inches deep. Before entering the water, arrange the roads and flagpoles back and forth to cultivate their ability to obey the guidance of the flagpoles and be familiar with the path of going out and returning.

The first time to go to the field, choose a large field with muddy and shallow water, and the one containing aquatic worms and fish is the most suitable.

    养鸭经验介绍
    编者按：6月25日，本报发表了冯新同志“希望介绍养鸭经验”的来信之后，很多读者来信介绍他们自己的养鸭经验。我们只选择了其中一部分在这里刊出。同时应该指出：这一地区的经验，不一定完全适合另一个地区的情况，而且其中大都是直接从实际饲养中得出的经验和办法，有些经验还待进一步在实践中去丰富它发展它，希望各地在采用这些经验时不要“死搬硬套”，一定要结合自己的经验，一定要从本地的情况出发。至于一般的饲养经验和方法，最好请参阅有关这方面的专业书籍。如畜牧兽医图书出版社出版的“饲养群鸭的经验”、中华书局出版的“北京鸭饲养法”等书，都有参考的价值。
    我过去曾养鸭维持生活。去年在长沙野牲饲养场任临时孵化技工。在实际劳动中体会到一些养鸭常识，写在下面供大家参考。
    要使鸭繁殖率高，生长期快，真正合乎发展生产的多、快、好、省，第一要选种。选种标准是：眼珠光大明朗，羽毛油软，紧贴体上的，体重，胫长，精神饱满的。
    不合乎饲养标准的有以下几种：大肚子，跛足，指脚小，瞎眼，短嘴。
    小鸭出壳二十四小时后，开始喂饭，用白饭洗凉，净口嚼碎喂养，锻练小鸭吃食。在喂完第一次约四小时后，再喂二次，然后用手一只只检查看吃了饭没有，免得饿死小鸭。教齐了口，每天可喂饱三餐就够了。饲料应有调剂：隔天喂青萍一次，饱食后可喂点切碎的青水细丝草。五天或十天，每支鸭可喂些新鲜的切碎的黄鳝。
    鸭棚宜坐北朝南阴凉通风。棚内宜每二十——三十只用篾围隔开，以免天冷成堆压死，天热聚拢发烧。每当白天十一时至下午二时，天气炎热，水温上涨时，要注意避暑。
    小鸭初次下水，应注意下列几点：要找水不超三寸深的活流地方。在未下水之前，安排好来回的道路和旗竹，培养它们能听从旗竹指导和熟悉出归路径。
    初下田宜大丘田，泥宜烂水宜浅，田中含水丝虫鱼的为最适合。
