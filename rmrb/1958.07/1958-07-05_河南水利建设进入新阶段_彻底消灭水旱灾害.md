Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 3rd: Henan Province's water conservancy construction has entered a new stage. This means, with technological revolution as the center, on the basis of improving quality and expanding benefits, it is moving from solving ordinary flood and drought disasters to fundamentally eliminating flood and drought disasters, and from serving agriculture to comprehensive development and utilization.

The guiding principles and tasks for Henan's water conservancy construction in the future, as proposed at the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Engineering Technology Innovation Conference which closed here on July 1st, are: continue to implement the water management policy of "emphasizing storage, emphasizing small-scale projects, and emphasizing community management"; actively build medium-sized projects and necessary large-scale projects on the basis of vigorously building small-scale projects, so as to combine large, medium, and small sizes to achieve a situation where there are no disasters in the event of 300 to 500 millimeters of rainfall in a day, and a guaranteed harvest in the event of no rain for a year, so as to completely eliminate flood and drought disasters. It is required that before 1962, or in a shorter period of time, on the basis of water conservancy, achieve mechanization of water lifting, rural electrification, and river network navigation.

According to this guiding principle and task, the conference pointed out that the scale of the water conservancy construction movement in Henan Province this coming winter and next spring will be larger, the quality higher, and the progress faster than last winter and this spring. For this reason, before September, it is necessary to do a good job in surveying, designing, and preparing construction machinery, materials, and other work for medium-sized projects.

The conference introduced various advanced experiences in water conservancy construction from all over the province. In terms of planning, Lushi County, in the upper reaches of the Nanluo River, made a plan to vigorously develop hydropower and electrify the entire county based on the characteristics of many rivers and large drops; Xi County made a plan for connecting rivers and canals and navigating the river network; Nanyang Prefecture made a plan to fully utilize the Baihe River to develop irrigation. The above plans are all being implemented, and some can be fully realized soon. In terms of design, there have been many bold creations: Shangu Reservoir in Xinxiang Prefecture has made various types of stone dams; in areas with poor plain foundations, when constructing canal structures, various wood structures and wattle bridge methods are used to reduce pressure and save expenses. In the project of diverting water up the mountains and across streams in Luoyang and Nanyang Prefectures, the mountain tunnels excavated are up to 1,400 meters long, and the aqueducts erected and the inverted siphons built are as high as 90 meters; the river dams built by Xihua and Fugou Counties on the Jialu River can pass flows of several hundred to more than a thousand cubic meters per second.

The conference emphasized that in water conservancy construction, it is necessary to establish a style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to create, and criticized the idea of not believing in the wisdom, strength, and experience of the masses, and thinking that one is remarkable, or the sense of inferiority of not believing in oneself; criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of being satisfied with the existing technical level; and criticized the saying that engineering technical experience that has not reached a conclusion and has not been tested by floods cannot be promoted. The conference lasted for eight days.

    河南水利建设进入新阶段
    彻底消灭水旱灾害
    据新华社郑州3日电　河南省的水利建设已经进入一个新的阶段。这就是以技术革命为中心，在提高质量和扩大效益的基础上，由解决普通水旱灾害进入从根本上消除水旱灾害的新阶段，由为农业服务进入全面开发、综合利用的新阶段。
    7月1日在此间闭幕的河南省水利工程技术革新会议上提出的今后河南省水利建设方针任务是：继续贯彻执行“以蓄为主，以小型为主，以社办为主”的治水方针；在大力兴修小型工程的基础上，积极兴修中型工程和必要的大型工程，做到大、中、小型相结合，以达到在一天降雨三百到五百公厘情况下不成灾，一年不下雨保丰收，彻底消灭水旱灾害。要求在1962年以前，或者更短一点的时间内，在水利化的基础上，实现提水机械化，农村电气化，河网航运化。
    会议根据这一方针任务，指出河南省今冬明春的水利建设运动规模将会比去冬今春的规模更大，质量更高，进度更快。为此，在9月以前，就必须做好中型工程的勘测设计和施工机械、料物等准备工作。
    这次会议介绍了全省各地各种各样的水利建设先进经验。在规划方面，南洛河上游的卢氏县根据河道多、落差大的特点，做了大力发展水电，全县电气化的规划；息县做了河渠相联，河网航运化的规划；南阳专区做了充分利用白河水发展灌溉的规划。上述规划都在贯彻执行中，有的不久就可以全部实现。在设计方面，有许多大胆创造：新乡专区的山谷水库做了各种类型的石坝；在平原基础较差的地区，做渠道建筑物时，采用各种木结构、荆篓桥办法，既减轻了压力，也节省了开支。洛阳、南阳专区在引水上山、过涧工程中，开凿的山洞最长的达一千四百公尺，架设的渡槽和兴建的倒虹吸高达九十公尺；西华、扶沟县在贾鲁河上建筑的拦河闸能通过几百到一千多秒公方流量。
    会议强调在水利建设中要树立敢想、敢说、敢创造的风格，批判了那种不相信群众的智慧、力量和经验，自以为了不起的思想，或不相信自己的自卑感；批判了满足于已有技术水平的右倾保守思想；批判了没有得出结论，没有经过洪水考验的工程技术经验，就不能推广的说法。这次会议共开了八天。
