    Protest Rally in the Hometown of Martyr Yang Liandi
    By Our Correspondent Yu Xigui
    These days, in Beicang, Tianjin, the hometown of the famous hero Yang Liandi, people enraged by the US-British aggression in the Middle East have been continuously holding various rallies and demonstrations in the streets and in the green fields. People are angrily warning US and British imperialism not to occupy the Middle East, otherwise the people of the hero's hometown will not spare the invaders.

    On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement—on the evening of the 26th, a massive protest rally was held in the hero's hometown. As soon as the sun set, Yang Yupu, the 72-year-old father of Martyr Yang Liandi, and the martyr's mother, wife, son, and younger brother arrived, each with an excited expression. White-haired old men, women holding babies, and elementary school students wearing red scarves arrived one after another. Some adults and young people, their clothes covered in mud, arrived. These agricultural cooperative members had just returned from the fields, some without even having eaten, and rushed to the meeting place.

    The meeting began. Yang Yupu excitedly stepped onto the podium and, looking at the crowd filled with anger, said: My son Yang Liandi gloriously sacrificed himself in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Our entire family has a blood feud with the American devils. Now the American devils and British robbers are invading the Middle East, and we will never agree to it! Before he could finish speaking, Yang Liandi's mother also excitedly stepped onto the podium and said: "I have never spoken in front of so many people, but today I cannot contain the anger in my heart and must say a few words. There are many of us, and we are powerful. We are not afraid of the American devils. If they still want to act recklessly, we must not stand by and watch the sisters in the Middle East lose their husbands and children, and their families broken. My eldest son Yang Liandi sacrificed himself to defend the country and protect our homes. Now I am determined to have my four sons and grandsons contribute everything to defend peace." These two elderly people's words aroused the anger of the masses. Countless fists were raised high, emitting steel-like shouts: "US and British aggressors get out of the Middle East!" "Resolutely defend world peace!"

    Then, a man wearing a faded military cap appeared in the crowd. People recognized him as the demobilized soldier Suo Baocai. He stepped onto the podium with firm steps and said loudly: "American devils are paper tigers, easily punctured, not scary at all. In mid-July 1953, I participated in the Jin Cheng counterattack launched by the Korean and Chinese troops, defeating the South Korean elite "White Tiger" regiment personally commanded by the American devils. In six days and nights, we wiped out more than 26,000 enemies. Enemy corpses were all over the mountains and plains. The American devils were driven to the end of their rope, forcing the American aggressors to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. Imperialism has always bullied the weak and feared the strong. We must wage a resolute struggle against them!" At this time, the mood at the meeting became even more excited, and people immediately launched a signature campaign to protest the US-British aggression. Yang Liandi's father was the first to write his name on the protest letter, and Yang Liandi's son, Yang Changlin, also solemnly wrote his name, expressing his determination to inherit his father's legacy at any time to defend peace and strike at the invaders. The masses also picked up pens and signed the protest letter, saying angrily: "Let the US-British robber dogs hear the roar of our hero's hometown! If they dare to invade, they are heading for their doom!"

    杨连弟烈士家乡的抗议集会
    本报记者　虞锡珪
    这些天，在著名登高英雄杨连弟烈士的家乡——天津北仓，被美英侵略中东的行为激怒了的人们，在大街上，在禾苗墨绿的田野里，不断地举行各种集会和示威游行。人们愤怒地警告美英帝国主义不许霸占中东，不然英雄家乡的人们饶不了侵略者。
    在朝鲜停战五周年前夕——26日晚上，在英雄家乡举行了声势浩大的抗议集会。太阳刚刚落山，杨连弟烈士的父亲、七十二岁的老人杨玉璞和烈士的母亲、妻子、儿子、弟弟等赶来了，他们每个人的脸上是那样的激动，白发苍苍的老人、怀抱婴儿的妇女、系带红领巾的小学生陆续赶来了。一些衣服上沾满了泥土的壮年人、青年人赶来了。这些农业社社员，刚刚从田里回来，有的还没来得及吃饭，就赶到大会会场。
    大会开始了，杨玉璞激动地走上了讲台，他看着会场上充满着怒火的人们说：我的儿子杨连弟在抗美援朝中光荣牺牲了，我们全家老少同美国鬼子有着血海深仇。现在美国鬼子和英国强盗侵略中东，我们坚决不答应！他的话音还未落，杨连弟的母亲也激动地走上讲台，她说：“我从来没在人多的地方讲过话，可是今天我忍不住心中的愤怒，也要说两句。我们人多力量大，不怕美国鬼子，如果他们还想胡作非为，我们绝不能看着中东的姐妹们夫离子散，家破人亡。我的大儿子杨连弟为了卫国保家牺牲了，现在我决心让我的四个儿子、孙子都为了保卫和平贡献一切。”这两位老年人的话引起了群众的愤怒，无数的拳头高高举起，发出钢铁般的呼声：“美英侵略者滚出中东去”“坚决保卫世界和平”。
    接着，人群中出现了一位头戴褪色军帽的男人，人们认出他是复员军人索宝才。他踏着刚毅的步子走上讲台大声地说：“美国鬼子是纸老虎，一碰就破，一点不可怕，1953年7月中旬我参加了朝中部队发起的金城反击战，打败了由美国鬼子亲自指挥的南朝鲜最精锐部队“白老虎”团，六昼夜就消灭两万六千多名敌人，敌人死尸满山遍野，打得美国鬼子走头无路，迫使美国侵略者在朝鲜停战协定上签了字。帝国主义一向是欺软怕硬，我们必须和他们进行坚决斗争！”这时，会场上的情绪更加激昂，人们立即展开了一个抗议美英侵略行为的签名运动。杨连弟的父亲首先在抗议书上写下了自己的名字，杨连弟的儿子杨长林也庄重地写下了自己的名子，表示了他为了保卫和平随时准备继承父亲的遗志，打击侵略者的决心。群众也纷纷拿起笔在抗议书上签了名，他们激愤地说：“让美英狗强盗听听我们英雄家乡的吼声吧！他们胆敢侵略就是死路一条！”
