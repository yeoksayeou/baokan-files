Maowen Qiang Autonomous County is located on both banks of the Min River in the eastern part of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The county has a population of over 110,000, including more than 33,000 Qiang people, over 70,000 Han people, over 7,000 Tibetan people, and over 1,200 Hui people.

Maowen is a rich and beautiful place. On both banks of the Min River, there are green terraced fields and fertile land everywhere. The overlapping mountains are covered with forests and contain various mineral resources such as iron, coal, copper, and gold. It produces many valuable furs and native medicinal materials. The original Wenchuan area within the county is also the habitat of the famous rare animal – the panda.

The Qiang people are one of the oldest ethnic groups recorded in Chinese history. The people are diligent and brave, skilled in farming and hunting, and excel in singing and dancing. The women's embroidery is very exquisite.

In the past, due to the dual oppression of reactionary rulers and the ruling class of their own ethnic group, the Qiang people had always been in a state of economic and cultural backwardness. In particular, the disharmony between and within ethnic groups, and the long-term armed conflicts, aggravated the disaster of the Qiang people, and the population gradually declined.

The Qiang people have a rich revolutionary tradition. They have continuously struggled against reactionary rulers. In 1935, when the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army passed through this area, the Qiang people, with the help of the Red Army, established a Soviet regime, and many young people joined the Red Army and went north to fight against Japan. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution ushered the Qiang people into a new era. Between 1955 and 1956, the county completed democratic reform through peaceful consultation and abolished the feudal land ownership system. Now, the number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounts for 82% of the total number of peasant households. By last year, the total grain output of the county had increased by 1.7 times compared with 1949. The lives of all ethnic groups have been greatly improved. Last year, the agricultural and sideline income of farmers of all ethnic groups increased fourfold compared with the eve of liberation. The county is not only self-sufficient in grain but also exported surplus grain for the first time. In the past, there was no industry in this area, but now there are ten factories and mines such as iron smelting and coal mining. Half of the county's townships are accessible by roads, and every township has telephones. The county has three middle schools and more than 100 primary schools, and the number of children enrolled in schools has increased fivefold compared with before liberation. There are cultural and health institutions in counties and districts.

A large number of cadres from all ethnic groups have also grown up. At present, there are more than 300 cadres from ethnic minorities such as Qiang, Tibetan, and Hui, accounting for 42% of the total number of cadres, of which 80% are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. In rural areas, a large number of farmers from all ethnic groups have joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League.

The establishment of the autonomous county has greatly encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people throughout the county. They put forward the heroic slogan of "one year of preparation, three years of hard work, and five years to change the face of the county," requiring that within five years, the average grain per person reach 1,500 to 2,000 catties, and the total output value of local industry be 6.8 times the total output value of agriculture.

    茂汶羌族自治县介绍
    茂汶羌族自治县位于阿坝藏族自治州东部的岷江两岸。全县人口十一万多人，其中羌族三万三千多人，汉族七万多人，藏族七千多人，回族一千二百多人。
    茂汶是个富饶美丽的地方。岷江两岸，到处是一块块绿色的梯田和肥沃的土地，重叠的山峦中森林遍布，蕴藏着铁、煤、铜、金等多种矿产，出产许多名贵的兽皮、土产药材。境内原汶川地区还是著名的稀有动物——熊猫的产地。
    羌族是在我国历史记载上最古老的民族之一。人民勤劳勇敢，能耕善猎，长于歌舞，妇女们的挑花刺绣十分精致。
    过去由于反动统治者和本民族统治阶级的双重压迫，羌族人民一直处于经济上、文化上十分落后的状态。特别是民族间和民族内部的不和，长期的械斗，更加重了羌族人民的灾难，人口日渐下降。
    羌族人民是富有革命传统的。他们曾不断地向反动统治者作斗争。1935年，中国工农红军经过这一带时，羌族人民在红军的帮助下建立了苏维埃政权，许多青年参加了红军北上抗日。中国人民革命的胜利，使羌族人民进入了新的时代。1955年和1956年间，全县通过和平协商的方式完成了民主改革，废除了封建土地所有制。现在，全县参加农业生产合作社的农户已占农户总数的82％。到去年，全县粮食总产量已比1949年增长一点七倍。各族人民生活有了很大改善。去年各族农民的农、副业收入比解放前夕增加四倍，全县粮食不但自给，而且第一次有余粮输出。过去，这个地区没有一点工业，现在已经有了炼铁、采煤等十个厂矿，全县一半的乡都通公路，乡乡有电话。全县有三所中学和一百多所小学，入学儿童比解放前增加了五倍。县、区普遍有文化和卫生机构。
    各民族的干部也大批成长起来。目前羌、藏、回等少数民族干部达三百多人，占干部总数的42％，其中80％是共产党员和共青团员。在农村中，大批各族农民加入了共产党和青年团。
    自治县的成立更大地鼓舞了全县人民的革命干劲。他们提出：“一年准备、三年苦战、五年改变面貌”的英雄口号，要求在五年内达到每人平均粮食一千五百斤——二千斤，地方工业总产值为农业总产值的六点八倍。（新华社成都9日电）（附图片）
