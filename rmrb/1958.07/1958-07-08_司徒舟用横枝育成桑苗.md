    Situ Zhou Uses Lateral Branches to Cultivate Mulberry Seedlings
    Situ Zhou, a technician at the Mulberry and Silkworm Breeding Station in Hua County, Guangdong, has successfully cultivated mulberry seedlings using mulberry lateral branches and seedling branches, which were previously considered waste. After testing, one mu of nursery land can cultivate 160,000 to 200,000 seedlings, with a survival rate of over 95%. On June 11th, the Zhanjiang Special District Subtropical Resource Development Committee convened silkworm technicians from various counties in Hua County, along with deputy directors and professional team leaders from key agricultural cooperatives developing silkworms, to conduct seedling cultivation training and promote this seedling cultivation method. The comrades present unanimously agreed that this method of seedling cultivation produces a large number of seedlings, has a high survival rate, grows quickly, and is labor-saving. Experiments have shown that lateral branches sprout in about five days after being inserted, grow leaves and roots in eight to fifteen days, and can be transplanted in three months.
    Zhanjiang Special District is a new base for the silkworm industry, and in the past, it had to rely on old silkworm areas to import seedlings. After the full-scale promotion of the lateral branch cultivation method, it will basically solve the needs of the district's major development of silkworm cultivation. According to the existing mulberry land area and the number of mulberry lateral branches, repeated seedling cultivation throughout the year until next autumn can cultivate more than 230 mu of expanded mulberry seedlings. This significant creation solves the long-standing contradiction between seedling supply and the speed and quantity of silkworm development, and greatly saves the cost of purchasing seedlings from other regions. Zhanjiang Special District is now fully promoting this seedling cultivation method.

    司徒舟用横枝育成桑苗
    广东化县桑蚕育种站技术员司徒舟，利用过去一向被认为是废物的桑条横枝和苗枝培育成了桑苗。经过试验，一亩苗地可育十六到二十万株苗，成活率达到95％以上。6月11日，湛江专区亚热带资源开发委员会在化县召集各县蚕桑技术员，发展蚕桑重点农业社的副主任，专业队长等进行育苗训练，推广了这一育苗方法。到会同志一致认为：用这种方法育苗数量多，成活率高，成长快，而且省工。实验证明：横枝插下后，五天左右出芽，八天至十五天长叶生根，三个月即可移植。
    湛江专区是蚕业的新基地，过去都要依靠老蚕区调进种苗。全面推广横枝育法后，将可基本解决全区蚕桑大发展的需要。该区现有桑地面积桑条横枝枝数计算，全年反复育苗到明秋共可培育出扩植桑苗二百三十多亩。这一重大创造解决了长期未能解决的种苗供应与蚕桑发展速度，数量之间的矛盾，并且大大节约了从外区购置种苗的费用。湛江专区现正在全面推广这一育苗方法。
