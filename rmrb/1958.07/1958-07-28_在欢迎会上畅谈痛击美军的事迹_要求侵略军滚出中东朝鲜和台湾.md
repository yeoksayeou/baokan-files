Xinhua News Agency, Andong, July 27th: The people of Andong City have been warmly welcoming the returning follow-up troops of the second batch of the Chinese People's Volunteers in recent days. At the welcome meetings and symposiums, the returning heroes talked to their relatives in the motherland about their heroic deeds of severely attacking the American invading army. They also expressed their support for the just struggle of the people of the Middle East and angrily demanded that the U.S. and British aggressor troops get out of the Middle East, and that the American aggressor troops get out of South Korea and out of Taiwan.

Second-Class Merit recipient, Platoon Leader Lieutenant Wu Zhenfang once led a platoon of soldiers in the Battle of Kimcheng to defend their position for a whole day and night, repelling seven enemy assaults and eliminating more than two hundred enemies. Today, this hero, who was awarded the Second Class National Flag Medal by the Korean government, and his comrades have returned with a statement condemning the crimes of U.S. and British imperialism in invading the Middle East and a letter of determination to support the struggle of the people of the Middle East. In the statement, they warned the aggressors not to forget the disastrous lesson of being beaten to a pulp on the Kimcheng front five years ago.

Combat Hero Captain Fang Peiying reported to the welcoming masses about their heroic deeds in a battle near Yuyin Mountain on the eve of the ceasefire, where they continuously captured enemy hilltop positions under the cover of powerful artillery fire in just ten minutes, completely wiping out more than two hundred American devils from the U.S. Army's "Ace" 7th Division. Fang Peiying said, "Now, these paper tigers who appear strong but are actually weak have gone to the Middle East to stir up trouble again. They will not have a good end!"

Second-Class Merit recipient Lieutenant Yu Changkui, who participated in the Battle of Shangganling, told the Young Pioneers of Andong City stories about the embarrassing appearance of the American invading army. He said that one day, after we repelled the enemy's eighth counterattack and eliminated more than a battalion of enemies, one remaining American soldier and one Turkish soldier hid in the cracks of rocks for three days, afraid to show their faces. It was not until they were so hungry that they could not bear it any longer that they obediently ran to our position with their hands raised and their heads covered. Their first words were to ask for something to eat. Lieutenant Yu Changkui said with great contempt: "You see, these are the kind of good-for-nothings that Eisenhower is sending to the Middle East to die." He expressed: We must, together with the people of the motherland and all peace-loving people in the world, fully support the just struggle of the people of the Middle East.

    在欢迎会上畅谈痛击美军的事迹
    要求侵略军滚出中东朝鲜和台湾
    新华社安东27日电 安东市人民连日来热烈欢迎中国人民志愿军第二批归国部队的后续部队。在欢迎会和座谈会上，凯旋归国的英雄们向祖国亲人畅谈了痛击美国侵略军的英雄事迹，并且纷纷表示支援中东人民的正义斗争，愤怒要求美英侵略军滚出中东，美国侵略军滚出南朝鲜、滚出台湾去。
    二等功臣、排长吴振芳少尉在金城反击战中曾经率领一个排的战士坚守阵地一昼夜，打垮敌人七次冲锋，消灭二百多敌人。今天，这位荣获朝鲜政府授予二级国旗勋章的英雄和他的战友们带着谴责美英帝国主义侵略中东罪行的声讨书和支援中东人民斗争的决心书归来了。声讨书上，他们警告侵略者不要忘了五年前在金城前线被打得头破血流的惨败教训。
    战斗英雄方培英大尉向欢迎群众报告了他们在停战前夕，鱼隐山附近的一次战斗中，仅十分钟就在强大炮火掩护下连续攻克敌人山头阵地，把美军“王牌”第七师的二百多美国鬼子全部消灭干净的英雄事迹。方培英说：“现在，就是这些外强中干的纸老虎又跑到中东去点火啦，他们不会有好下场！”
    参加过上甘岭战役的二等功臣郁长奎少尉向安东市少先队员们讲述了美国侵略军的狼狈像的故事。他说，有一天，当我们打退了敌人第八次反扑、消灭了一个多营的敌人之后，剩下一个美国兵和土耳其兵在石头缝里躲藏了三天不敢露头，一直到肚子饿得实在不行了才一个举着双手一个捂着脑袋乖乖地跑到我们阵地上投降。他们第一句话就是要东西吃。郁长奎少尉十分蔑视地说：“你们看，就是这样一些草包货，又被艾森豪威尔送到中东去送死了。”他表示：一定要和祖国人民和全世界爱好和平人民一道，全力支援中东人民的正义斗争。
