    Shanxi·Anhui
    High-Yield Records of Over 3,000 Jin of Wheat Constantly Appear
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Sixth Team of the Lianfu Agricultural Cooperative in Lianfu Township, Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, harvested 5,427 jin of spring barley from 1.405 mu after actual measurement, averaging 3,863 jin per mu.
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Liuzhuang Production Team of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Zhaoji Township, Funan County, Anhui Province, had 4.091 mu of high-yield wheat land. After careful harvesting, threshing, and winnowing, the average actual yield was 3,578 jin of wheat per mu, creating the highest wheat yield record in Anhui Province.
    The reasons this cooperative achieved such a high yield, in addition to the leadership and attention of the Party and the hard work of all cooperative members in overcoming various difficulties and natural disasters, especially after overcoming conservative thinking and actively adopting new technical measures, are as follows: (1) Deep plowing and multiple harrowing: This high-yield wheat land was originally a vegetable garden, with relatively fertile soil. Land preparation began in late September, with plowing to a depth of one foot with a shovel. In mid-October, shallow cultivation and multiple harrowings were carried out to make the soil fine, loose, and level, followed by sowing; (2) Applying sufficient fertilizer: At the time of sowing, 1,200 jin of dried manure and 15 jin of ammonium sulfate were used as base fertilizer per mu, and topdressing was applied in five installments during the growth period; (3) Selecting the superior variety "Nanda 2419" with a seeding rate of 32 jin per mu; (4) Strengthening field management.
    (Reported by our newspaper) Song Qingyun, a Communist Party member of the Hanzhuang Production Team of the Shengfu Agricultural Cooperative in Santasi Township, Funan County, Anhui Province, cultivated seven mu of high-yield wheat, averaging 3,168 jin per mu, including 0.5 mu that yielded 2,550 jin. Their main experiences in achieving a bumper harvest are: timely sowing, close planting, rational fertilization, and strengthened field management.

    山西·安徽
    小麦三千多斤高产纪录不断出现
    本报讯　山西介休县连福乡连福农业社第六队，一亩四分零五春大麦实打五千四百二十七斤，平均亩产三千八百六十三斤。
    本报讯　安徽阜南县赵集乡红光农业社刘庄生产队有四亩零九厘一小麦高额丰产田，经过细收细打、风干扬净，平均每亩实收小麦三千五百七十八斤，创造了安徽省小麦亩产量的最高纪录。
    这个社之所以获得这样的高额丰产，除了党的领导与重视以及全体社员们的辛勤苦干，克服了种种困难和自然灾害，尤其是克服了保守思想之后积极采用新的技术措施以外，还有如下经验：（1）深刨多耙：这块小麦高额丰产地原来是菜园地，土壤较肥沃，9月下旬即开始整地，用锹深刨一尺，10月中旬又进行浅耕和多耙，使土壤细碎平整，随即播种；（2）施足肥料：播种时每亩又用粪干一千二百斤和硫酸铵十五斤作基肥，生长期间又分期追肥五次；（3）选用南大2419良种，每亩播种量三十二斤；（4）加强了田间管理。
    本报讯　安徽省阜南县许堂区三塔乡胜阜农业社韩庄生产队共产党员宋庆云，培养了七亩丰产小麦，平均亩产三千一百六十八斤，其中有五分地实收二千五百五十斤。他们获得丰收的主要经验是：适时下种，密植，合理施肥，加强田间管理。
