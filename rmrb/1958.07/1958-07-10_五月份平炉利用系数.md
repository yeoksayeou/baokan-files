    Open Hearth Utilization Rate in May

    In May, the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant had the most advanced open hearth utilization rate. The open hearth utilization rates of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant also significantly improved compared to April. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's May production level of open hearth steelmaking has met the requirements of the assured completion plan, showing progress compared to last year and each month of the first quarter of this year.

    The units whose utilization coefficients decreased in May compared to April include Tianjin Steel Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel No. 2 Steel Plant, and No. 1 Steel Plant. The reason for the decline in Tianjin Steel Plant's utilization coefficient is that after implementing double-tap holes on No. 2 open hearth furnace in May, they discovered a problem with the furnace head angle, so they had to carry out a medium repair. Anshan Iron and Steel No. 2 Steel Plant's smelting time in May was thirty minutes longer than planned, and there were also many unplanned repairs. At the beginning of the month, due to improper handling of the uptakes and water jackets of the plant's No. 11 open hearth furnace, an accident occurred in which molten steel froze in the furnace, resulting in a reduction of more than 15,000 tons of steel compared to the plan in May.

    (Note: The open hearth utilization coefficient is the amount of iron produced by each cubic meter of open hearth volume in 24 hours.) (Attached table)

### 五月份平炉利用系数

    五月份平炉利用系数
    5月份平炉利用系数最先进的单位是上海第三钢铁厂，上海第一钢铁厂、重庆第三钢铁厂和太原钢铁厂的平炉利用系数也比4月份有了显著提高。冶金部5月份平炉炼钢的生产水平已经达到必成计划的要求，较去年和今年一季度各月的生产水平都有进步。
    5月份的利用系数较4月份下降的有天津钢厂、鞍钢第二炼钢厂和第一炼钢厂等单位。天津钢厂利用系数下降的原因是他们5月份在二号平炉上实现双槽出钢后发现这个炉子的炉头角度存在问题，因此不得不进行了中修。鞍钢第二炼钢厂5月份的冶炼时间比计划延长了三十分钟，而且非计划检修的时间也很多。这个厂的11号平炉在月初由于对上升道和水套的处理不当，出现了钢水冻结在炉内的事故，结果5月份比计划少产一万五千多吨钢。
   （注：平炉利用系数就是每一立方公尺的平炉容积在二十四小时所炼出的铁的数量）（附图表）
