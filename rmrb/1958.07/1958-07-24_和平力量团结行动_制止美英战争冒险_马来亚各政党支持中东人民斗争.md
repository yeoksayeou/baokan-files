Comprehensive report by our newspaper. According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Leaders of most political parties in Malaya have successively issued statements expressing support for the national independence movements in the Middle East and opposing the US-UK armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries.

Ismail, Secretary-General of the United Malays National Organisation, a member party of the ruling Alliance Party of Malaya, said on the 21st that in principle, his party supports the national independence movements of Middle Eastern countries.

Sambanthan, Chairman of the Malayan Indian Congress, another member party of the ruling party, said that all countries that have gained freedom should give moral support to the Arab nationalist movement.

Osman Abdullah, Secretary-General of the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party, said that his party believes that the United States and Britain should not interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, as this constitutes a threat to world peace.  Sydney Washa Gam, Secretary-General of the People's Progressive Party, said that the government should instruct Malaya's representative to the United Nations to condemn the armed aggression of the United States and Britain in the Middle East in the United Nations.

Ramanathan, Chairman of the Malayan Labour Party, issued a statement on the 21st condemning the US and UK for sending troops to invade Middle Eastern countries. The statement expressed opposition to the United States and Britain supporting reactionary and feudal groups in countries that are engaged in national independence struggles. Ramanathan also said that the deployment of US and British troops in the Middle East undoubtedly aggravated the tense situation. The Malayan People's Party issued a statement as early as the 19th condemning the US and UK for interfering in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern Arab countries.

The statement demanded that the United States and Britain immediately withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

The statement said that the US-UK armed intervention in the Middle East violated the United Nations Charter and was a blatant attempt to provoke a world war.

Naseer Lang, Secretary-General of the Malayan People's Party, told newspaper reporters on the same day that the US and British troops must immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. He pointed out that US and British armed intervention in the Middle East would lead to a world war and would also violate the United Nations Charter. He said that the People's Party calls on the people of Malaya and the world who love peace to unite closely to oppose any measures taken by imperialism to launch a world war in order to realize their ambitions.

Chua Choon Kui, Chairman of the Selangor State Branch of the Labour Party, said in a statement on the same day that the Iraqi events are a concrete manifestation of the tide of the Middle Eastern nationalist movement, which can never be suppressed by any military action. He said that the United States and Britain's dispatch of troops to land in Lebanon and Jordan this time is not only a direct interference in the internal affairs of the two countries and a violation of the United Nations Charter, but may also become the fuse of another world war, which is unanimously condemned by peace-loving people all over the world.

    马来亚各政党支持中东人民斗争
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：马来亚大多数政党领导人先后发表谈话，表示支持中东的民族独立运动，反对美英武装干涉阿拉伯国家的内政。
    马来亚联合邦执政党马华印联盟成员党派之一马来民族联合机构的总书记伊斯梅尔21日说，在原则上，他的党支持中东国家的民族独立运动。
    执政党的另一个成员党派马来亚印度人大会党主席桑班坦说，所有已经获得自由的国家都应该给予阿拉伯民族主义运动以道义上的支持。
    泛马来亚伊斯兰党总书记奥斯曼·阿卜杜拉说，他的党认为美国和英国不应该干涉中东国家的内政，因为这构成对世界和平的威胁。人民进步党总书记薛尼华沙甘说，政府应该训令马来亚驻联合国的代表在联合国中谴责美、英在中东的武装侵略行为。
    马来亚劳工党主席拉马纳坦在21日发表一项声明，谴责美英出兵侵略中东国家。声明表示反对美国和英国在那些正在进行民族独立斗争的国家中支持反动集团和封建集团的做法。拉马纳坦还说，美英派兵在中东登陆无疑地加剧了紧张局势。马来亚人民党早在19日就发表一项声明，谴责美英干涉中东阿拉伯国家的内政。
    声明要求美国和英国立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出它们的侵略军。
    声明说，美英在中东的武装干涉行动违反了联合国宪章，并且是公然企图挑起世界大战的行动。
    马来亚人民党总书记那塞朗同日对报纸记者说，美、英两国军队必须立即自黎巴嫩和约旦撤退。他指出，美、英武装干涉中东将会招致世界大战，同时，也违反联合国宪章。他说，人民党呼吁马来亚和全世界热爱和平的人民紧紧地团结在一起，反对帝国主义为实现它们的野心而发动世界大战的任何措施。
    劳工党雪兰峨州分部主席蔡春贵在同一天发表谈话说，伊拉克事件是中东民族主义运动浪潮的具体表现，这绝不是任何武力行动所能压制的。他说，美国和英国这次派兵登陆黎巴嫩和约旦不仅是直接干涉两国的内政和违反联合国的宪章，并且可能成为另一次世界大战的导火线，这是全世界热爱和平的人民所一致谴责的。
