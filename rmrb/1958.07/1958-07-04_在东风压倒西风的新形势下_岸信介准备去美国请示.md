In the New Situation Where the East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind
Nobusuke Kishi Prepares to Go to the United States for Instructions
Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd – Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi stated on July 1st that he would visit the United States in the autumn of this year. Nobusuke Kishi will discuss with the US government a series of major issues facing Japan in the new situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind. His main purpose is to exchange further reliance on the United States for American aid in order to solve Japan's economic crisis.

According to Kyodo News, Nobusuke Kishi will ask the U.S. government what position and role Japan should occupy in the U.S. atomic strategy system under the new situation. Nobusuke Kishi attempts to secretly discuss with the US government turning Japan into a US atomic war base in the Far East, and re-examining Japan's rearmament issue and the close cooperation and strengthening of cooperation between Japan and the United States in "common defense" according to this policy, so as to make Japan further follow the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war, creating international tension. According to Kyodo News, at the same time, Nobusuke Kishi also wants to hear the United States' intentions towards China, and ask the United States about the "new policy" on Sino-Japanese relations proposed by Japan from the standpoint of a member of the "free countries". Recently, the United States has been stepping up the creation of a "two Chinas" conspiracy. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' legal adviser, Seligman, has already proposed a plan to create "two Chinas" by demanding international guarantees of the "independence and security" of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group under the guise of "recognizing China." Japanese government State Minister Hayato Ikeda publicly stated his agreement with the American plan to create "two Chinas" after a cabinet meeting on July 1st. According to Kyodo News, one of the important purposes of Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States is to discuss strengthening Japan-U.S. economic cooperation with the U.S. authorities. This includes begging for US dollars, requesting US assistance in implementing Japan's so-called "Southeast Asia Development Fund Plan" for economic expansion in Southeast Asia, and requesting the United States to ease the anti-Japanese goods movement.

However, just as the United States is experiencing an economic crisis and is unable to take care of itself, the US authorities are quite indifferent to Nobusuke Kishi's plan to visit the United States.

    在东风压倒西风的新形势下
    岸信介准备去美国请示
    据新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介7月1日表示，他要在今年秋天访问美国。岸信介将同美国政府商讨在东风压倒西风的新形势下日本所面临的一系列重大问题。他的主要目的是想用更进一步投靠美国的办法来换取美国的援助，以解救日本的经济危机。
    据共同社透露，岸信介将向美国政府请示，在新形势下，日本在美国的原子战略体系中应该占有怎样的地位和起着什么作用。岸信介企图同美国政府秘密商量把日本变为美国在远东的原子战争基地，并且根据这个方针重新研究日本的重新武装问题和日美两国在“共同防御”方面的密切配合和加强合作，以便使日本进一步追随美国扩军备战，制造国际紧张局势。据共同社透露，同时，岸信介还要听取美国对中国的意图，并且向美国请示日本从“自由国家”的一员的立场出发提出的关于中日关系问题的“新方针”。最近美国正在加紧制造“两个中国”的阴谋。美国国务卿杜勒斯的法律顾问塞利格曼已经提出一个在“承认中国”的烟幕下要求在国际上保证台湾蒋介石集团的“独立和安全”制造“两个中国”的方案。岸信介政府国务相池田勇人1日在一次内阁会议后已经公开出面表示同意美国这个制造“两个中国”的方案。据共同社透露，岸信介访问美国的重要目的之一是：同美国当局讨论加强日美经济合作。其中包括乞求美元，要求在美国协助下，执行日本向东南亚实行经济扩张的所谓“东南亚开发基金计划”，要求美国缓和排斥日货运动。
    但是，正当美国发生经济危机而自顾不暇的时候，美国当局对岸信介访问美国的计划是颇冷漠的。
