Auntie Visits Relatives (Shandong KuaiShu)
Tian Li

It was March 21st this year, with a drizzle falling from the sky, the roads were muddy and difficult to walk on, each step making a "guji" sound. At this time, the road was deserted, and vehicles were scarce everywhere. Hey, two people came along the road, one in front and one behind, walking hurriedly. I hurried forward to take a closer look, and it turned out to be Uncle and Auntie. Uncle was not very strong to begin with, but he was carrying a bag of rice, and Auntie was carrying a bamboo basket, filled with a plate of sticky rice cakes, four apples, and an old hen. Without anyone telling me, I knew they were going to visit relatives.
(White: Hey, why are they visiting relatives at our position?) Their relatives should live in the village, not in the trenches. Oh, I understand now, they are coming to our Third Company. They are the old landlords of our company, and we have a very close relationship with them. When we arrived in their village, it was just after the war, and it was a desolate scene, with children crying for their parents, and old people calling for their sons and daughters! This scene touched our volunteer soldiers, and everyone stamped their feet and cursed American imperialism: You guys invaded Korea to make a fortune, but you have harmed the Korean people and made them suffer. One day if we catch you, we will tear your tendons and skin you alive. At this time, the superiors mobilized us to actively help North Korea restore its construction. We built dozens of houses and took the Korean people back. The third squad leader carried Little Jinzi, the fifth squad deputy helped Auntie, Liu Jinde led the old yellow cow, and also held the old hen in his hand, Wang Shouyi carried the luggage roll, and also led Uncle. In this way, they entered the village bustling with noise and excitement, and they all lived in the main rooms. From then on, we became a family, working and producing together, cultivating wasteland and planting golden millet, and harvesting white rice. People are not plants and have feelings, and Auntie was deeply moved. The old woman said three times a day that she had met a group of good Chinese sons and daughters. When our comrades were slightly uncomfortable, Auntie would be very anxious, serving diligently all day long, asking about warmth and taking care of you. Last year, we had a major transfer and came to this new position. Auntie was really reluctant to leave, and her eyelids were red from crying. Last year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, the old woman also came here. Bringing rice cakes and rice, to visit her Chinese sons and daughters, at that time she searched all over this mountain valley, which exhausted her. Fortunately, she had the political instructor's small photo, and finally found our company. We also held a welcome party to entertain dear Auntie. Auntie, smiling, carefully looked at each of our bodies, looking at him, looking at you, touching the little devil Wang Shouyi, (White: Is your body strong? Do you eat a lot or a little?) Auntie washed dirty socks for the third squad, and mended torn military uniforms for the fifth squad. We kept her for three days, and then sent her home happily. Today they came to our Third Company again, also leading her old partner, the white-haired Uncle. Seeing everyone, tears dripped, first joy and then sigh:
"You are withdrawing your troops and returning to your country, and Auntie is going to be very sad. In those years, we were suffering, thanks to you for coming to kill the enemy. Shedding blood and sacrificing to aid North Korea, the mountains and waters are deep with friendship. After the war, you helped us build our homes and actively restore production. Now we are organized and use machines for collective production. Our lives have been greatly improved, even more than before the war. Thanks to the Party and Kim Il-sung, it's all thanks to their leadership! We also thank the Chinese People's Volunteers and the wise leader Chairman Mao. Today we come to see you off, the gifts are meager and express our feelings. May you return to your motherland safely and all your work goes smoothly. When you see your parents, relatives and friends, please say hello, and don't forget Auntie from North Korea. Maybe one day I will go to China to visit my Chinese sons and daughters and visit relatives."

    阿妈妮走亲戚（山东快书）
    田里说的是今年3月21，天上下着牛毛雨，道路泥泞不好走，走一步脚下一咕唧。这时候路上断了人，四处冷落车马稀。哎，大路上过来人两个，一前一后走得急，赶忙上前仔细看，原来是阿爸基和阿妈妮。阿爸基身体本来不结实，可还背了一袋子米，阿妈妮手提竹篮子，装的是一盘粘糕、四个苹果、
  还有一只老母鸡。不用人说俺知道，他们准是去走亲戚。
  （白：哎，走亲戚为啥来到俺阵地？）他亲戚也该住村庄，不可能住在坑道里。噢，说到这里俺明白了，他们是到俺三连的。他们是俺连的老房东，关系搞得挺亲密。俺到他们村正好刚停战，满眼凄凉一片废墟，小孩子哭叫找父母，老人家呼唤叫儿女！这景象触动了咱志愿军，个个跺脚骂美帝国主义：你小子侵略朝鲜发大财，可害了朝鲜人民受委屈，有朝一日抓住你，抽你的筋来扒你的皮。这时候上级作动员，帮助朝鲜恢复建设要积极，俺们大伙修了房子几十间，把朝鲜人民接回去。三班长背着小金子，五班副扶着阿妈妮，刘进德牵着老黄牛，手里还抱着老母鸡，王守义扛着行李卷，一边还领着阿爸基。就这样热热闹闹进了村，他们都住进了正房里。从此我们成了一家人，生产劳动在一起，开荒种下黄金谷，收割打出雪白米。人非草木都有情，深深感动了阿妈妮，她老人家一天说三遍，说是她碰到了一群中国好儿
  女。我们的同志稍有不舒服，可就急坏了阿妈妮，一天到晚勤伺候，问寒问暖照顾你。去年我们大调防，来到这个新阵地，阿妈妮可真舍不得，眼皮都哭得红红的。去年8月中秋节，老人家也曾来这里。拿着糕，带着米，来看望他的中国儿女，那时她找遍了这山沟，可把她累得了不得。幸亏拿着指导员的小相片，最后才找到俺连里。我们还开了个欢迎会儿，招待亲爱的阿妈妮。阿妈妮，笑嘻嘻，挨个端详我们身体，看看他，望望你，摸摸小鬼王守义，（白：你的身体壮不壮？吃饭多多的还是少少的？）阿妈妮给三班洗了脏袜子，替五班补了破军衣，我们留她三天正，又送她高高兴兴回家去。今天他们又来咱三连，还领着她的老伴白发苍苍的阿
  爸基。见了大伙泪珠滴，先是欢喜后叹气：
  “你们撤军要回国，可要想坏了阿妈妮，当年我们正遭难，多亏你们来杀敌。流血牺牲援朝鲜，山高水深有情谊，战后帮我们建家园，恢复生产更积极。如今我们组织起，集体生产用机器，生活已经大改善，超过战前还有余。感谢党和金日成，这都亏他们领导的！也要感谢中国志愿军，和英明的领袖毛主席。今天我们来欢送，礼物微薄表心意。愿你们平安回祖国，样样工作都顺利。见到了父母亲友多问好，可别忘了朝鲜的阿妈妮。说不定哪天俺到中国去，要看望中国儿女走亲戚。”
