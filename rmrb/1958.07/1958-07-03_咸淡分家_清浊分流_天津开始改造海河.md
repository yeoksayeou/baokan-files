Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 1st: The transformation project to "separate salt and fresh water, and divert clear and polluted flows" of the Haihe River, which is of great significance to the economic development of Tianjin's urban and rural areas and the lives of its residents, began in full swing today. The first batch of 9,000 laborers composed of government cadres, enterprise employees, People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tianjin, students, suburban farmers, and street residents, who are participating in voluntary labor, began constructing the key project for separating salt and fresh water at the mouth of the Haihe River - the tide gate today.

The project to thoroughly transform the Haihe River includes two major parts: building a gate at the mouth of the Haihe River and renovating the sewer system. Through these projects, sewage will not enter the river, saltwater will not go upstream, good water will not be lost, and sewage will be utilized.

After the completion of the two major projects to transform the Haihe River, Tianjin's appearance will undergo tremendous changes. The main functions of these two projects are: First, after the construction of the gate and dam at the mouth of the Haihe River, the Haihe River will become a reservoir of clear and fresh water, with the water level maintained at 2.5 meters above the Dagukou sea level. The river will regularly store nearly 80 million cubic meters of water, which can regulate the peak water consumption of Tianjin's industry. Second, about 1.55 billion cubic meters of fresh water used for "flushing sewage" and "suppressing salinity" in the Haihe River every year in the past can be saved for irrigation. It is estimated that 3.1 million mu of rice can be irrigated, and the annual rice production can be increased by about 1.2 billion jin. In addition, the nitrogen content of the sewage in the sewer system is about 2%. If all the sewage is utilized, it can replace 15 million jin of chemical fertilizer and 1.8 billion jin of base fertilizer every year. Third, it will facilitate shipping and develop trade. At present, 3,000-ton seagoing vessels can only enter Tianjin half-loaded by taking advantage of the tide. After the gate is built, 3,000 to 5,000-ton seagoing vessels can sail fully loaded directly into Tianjin. Fourth, it can beautify the city.

The scale of the project to transform the Haihe River is huge. The Haihe River gate and sewer project alone requires excavating and filling more than 5 million cubic meters of earth, which is equivalent to three times the amount of earthwork for the Ming Tombs Reservoir dam. The total length of the renovated sewer pipes is 202 kilometers, of which 30 kilometers of pipes have a diameter of 3 meters, and jeeps can pass through them. This quantity is close to the total length of sewers built in the 80 to 90 years before liberation. These two projects were originally planned to be completed in three years. According to the spirit of the General Line, in order to quickly and thoroughly solve the water source problem in Tianjin, it was decided that all the projects will be basically completed by the end of March next year.

At present, Tianjin's various enterprise departments have rushed to manufacture and transport a large number of construction machinery and equipment, and all sectors of the city have signed up to participate in voluntary labor, determined to make this ancient river serve the cause of socialist construction more obediently.

### 咸淡分家　清浊分流  天津开始改造海河

    咸淡分家　清浊分流
    天津开始改造海河
    据新华社天津1日电　对天津市城乡经济发展和居民生活具有重大意义的使海河河水“咸淡分家、清浊分流”的改造工程，今天全面动工。首批参加义务劳动的机关干部、企业职工、解放军驻津部队、学生、郊区农民和街道居民组成的九千名劳动大军，今天开始在海河河口建设咸淡分家的枢纽工程——防潮闸。
    彻底改造海河的工程，包括在海河口建闸和下水道改建两大部分。通过这些工程，将使污水不入河，咸水不上溯，好水不流失，污水被利用起来。
    改造海河的两大工程完工后，天津市的面貌将发生巨大的变化。这两项工程主要的作用是：一，海河口建闸打坝以后，海河成为一个清水和淡水的蓄水库，水位可维持在大沽海平零上二点五公尺，河身经常蓄水近八千万公方，天津工业高峰用水可以得到调节。二，过去海河每年用于“冲污”、“压咸”的约十五点五亿公方淡水，可以节约下来灌溉。预计可灌水稻三百一十万亩，每年可增产稻谷约十二亿斤。另外下水道污水含氮量约2％，如果全部污水都利用起来，每年可代替化肥一千五百万斤，底肥十八亿斤。三，便利航运和发展贸易。现在三千吨的海轮只能半载趁潮进入天津。建闸以后，三千至五千吨的海轮可以满载直驶天津市内。四，可以美化城市。
    改造海河的工程规模巨大，仅海河闸及下水道工程就需要挖填土五百多万公方，相当于十三陵水库拦河坝土方量的三倍。改造下水道管道的总长为二百零二公里，其中有三十公里管子的口径达三公尺，吉普车可以在里边通行。这个数量接近于解放前八、九十年来所修下水道的总长度。这两项工程原计划三年完成，根据总路线的精神，为迅速彻底地解决天津市的水源问题，决定在明年3月底全部工程基本完成。
    目前天津市各企业部门已赶制和赶运了大批施工机械和器材，全市各界纷纷报名参加义务劳动，决心使这条古老的河流更驯服地为社会主义建设事业服务。（附图片）
