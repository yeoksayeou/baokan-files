    "The Nanny"
    The Soviet feature film "The Nanny," dubbed and reproduced by the Shanghai Film Studio, is adapted from Stanyukovich's novel of the same name. Through the life fragments of a Russian sailor, Chek, it exposes the ugly and cruel nature of the exploiting classes in the Tsarist era, and reflects the urgent desire of the working people to pursue truth and yearn for freedom.
    After being injured, the kind and upright Chek was transferred to work as a servant in the home of a lieutenant colonel naval captain, becoming the nanny of the lieutenant colonel's son, Sula. His sincere love infected the pure-hearted child Sula, enabling him to understand love and hate; he helped the maid Anyutka, who had suffered humiliation and lost confidence in life, see the future; and he exposed the bad deeds of the cook Ivan, who took advantage of his position to bully the weak and harm the good, bringing him punishment. Chek not only fulfilled his responsibility as Sula's nanny, but also acted as a "nanny" for the people around him.
    In the end, just as Chek said to Sula, "Birds don't like cages, not even golden ones," Chek finally left, heading towards the vast and free world... (Yuan Xin)

    “保姆”
    上海电影制片厂配音复制的苏联故事片“保姆”，是根据斯塔纽科维奇的同名小说改编摄制。它通过俄罗斯一个水兵——契克的生活片断，揭发了帝俄时代剥削阶级的丑恶、残酷的本性，反映了劳动人民追求真理、向往自由的迫切心情。
    善良正直的契克受伤后调作中校舰长家里的勤务兵，当了中校儿子苏拉的保姆。他的真挚的爱，感染了心灵纯洁的儿童苏拉，使他懂得爱憎；帮助了受尽凌辱、对生活失去信心的女仆安尤特卡，使她看到了未来；揭露了厨子伊凡狐假虎威、欺弱陷良的坏蛋行为，使他得到惩罚。契克不仅对苏拉尽到了保姆的责任，对于他周围的人也都起了保姆的作用。
    最后，正如契克对苏拉说的“鸟儿是不喜欢笼子的，哪怕是一只金丝笼”，契克终于走了，走向了广阔自由的天地……。　（袁心）
