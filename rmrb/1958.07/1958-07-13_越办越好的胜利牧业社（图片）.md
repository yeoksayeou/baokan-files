The Increasingly Well-Managed Victory Animal Husbandry Cooperative

Under the leadership and with the help of the League Committee, the Victory Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has basically achieved settled nomadism and is now working on electrification. The herdsmen have all turned on electric lights. They will also use electricity for production, such as milk processing and wool shearing.

    越办越好的胜利牧业社
    内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟胜利牧业社在盟党委的领导和帮助下，已基本上实现了定居游牧，现在正搞电气化。牧民们已全部点上了电灯。他们还将利用电气搞生产，如牛奶加工和剪羊毛等。

    胜利牧业社的定居地，已有了两台锅驼机，利用它抽水灌溉饲料基地和供牲畜饮水。
