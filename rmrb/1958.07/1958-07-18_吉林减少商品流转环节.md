Finance and Trade System Carries Out Technical Innovation

    Changchun, July 16th (from our newspaper) – The commercial system in Jilin Province has carried out a series of reforms. The primary reform is to cut out redundant commodity circulation links. In recent years, Jilin Province has gradually established a strong socialist commercial network from cities to villages, but the number of commodity circulation links has increased. For example, agricultural and sideline products from rural areas to cities have to go through five links from specialized companies to wholesale departments to retail stores. This slows down the circulation speed and increases costs. For example, Taipingchuan in Changling County is only one hundred and twenty *li* away from Changchun City. According to the natural circulation pattern of commodities, it should take no more than seven days for eggs purchased from here to reach retail outlets. However, in the past, it took at least twenty days, which not only increased transportation costs but also easily caused the eggs to become moldy and deteriorated. Commodities from cities to rural areas also had to go through three to four links. Now, commodity circulation is organized according to economic zones. Wherever it is possible to directly allocate and transport goods from production units or grassroots purchasing units directly to retail units, this is being implemented.

    This has many benefits: first, it accelerates the circulation of commodities, generally shortening the circulation time by two-thirds; second, it reduces losses during the circulation process, creating conditions for the year-round purchase of certain perishable non-staple foods; third, it greatly reduces commodity circulation costs, saving the provincial commercial system 30 million yuan per year; and fourth, direct supply of agricultural products to cities and timely supply of industrial products to rural areas further invigorate the urban and rural economy.

    吉林减少商品流转环节
    本报长春16日电　吉林省商业系统进行了一系列的改革。这些改革中首要的一项是：砍掉多余的商品流转环节。几年来，吉林省从城市到乡村，逐步建立起强大的社会主义商业网，但商品流转环节增多了。如从农村到城市的农副产品，由专业公司到批发部到达零售商店，要经过五道环节。这样流转速度慢，费用高。如长岭县太平川离长春市只有一百二十华里，按照商品的自然流转规律，由这里收购鸡蛋到零售点流转时间不超过七天。但是过去最少也需要二十天，不但增加了运输费用，而且容易使鸡蛋霉臭变质。从城市到农村的商品，也要经过三至四道环节。现在，按经济区划组织商品流转，凡是能够产销直接调拨运输的，都实行从生产单位或基层采购单位直接运到零售单位。
    这样做有许多好处：一、加速了商品的流转，一般的能缩短流转时间三分之二；二、减少了流转过程的损失，为某些不易保管的副食品的常年收购创造了条件。三、大大降低了商品流转费用，全省商业系统一年可节省流转费用三千万元。四、农产品直线供应城市，工业品及时供应农村，进一步活跃了城乡经济。
