Khrushchev's Letter to Nehru

Respected Prime Minister,

In view of the situation developing in the Near and Middle East, I am sending you the following appeal:

Due to the American aggression against Lebanon and the British aggression against Jordan, we are currently at one of the most critical junctures in human history, characterized by the fact that we are on the brink of the greatest disaster imaginable if we are not careful.

The United States and Britain, after taking aggressive actions against Lebanon and Jordan, insist that their actions are only of a local nature. However, history proves that any local war can easily turn into a world war. In estimating the current aggressive activities of the United States and Britain in the Near and Middle East, we have no right to forget the lessons of history.

The Soviet government believes that in the current situation where military conflicts have already occurred, the governments of countries that bear the primary responsibility for maintaining peace should demonstrate the greatest calm and rationality, so that their actions do not lead to a world war. We believe that these governments, in seeking solutions to problems, should not seek ways to provoke war and cause disaster to the world, but should seek solutions through negotiation. Reason and calm should be employed to eliminate war and ensure peaceful coexistence among nations and world peace.

The armed intervention of the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan is a continuation of the old policies of colonialism. Your country has also been a victim of this policy. This policy always ends with the downfall of its executors.

The Soviet government believes that the wisest solution would be for the United States and British troops to withdraw immediately from the territories of Lebanon and Jordan, allowing the people of these two countries to arrange their own destiny according to their own wishes.

The Soviet government believes that at this dangerous moment in human history, when the question of war or peace is to be resolved, the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India must meet immediately with the participation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to take measures to stop the military conflicts that have already occurred.

The Soviet government proposes that the heads of government of the aforementioned countries meet on July 22 in Geneva or any other location.

While proposing a summit meeting of heads of government, the Soviet government believes that after this meeting has formulated specific recommendations on ending the conflict in the Near and Middle East, it should submit these recommendations to the Security Council, which should discuss them with the participation of Arab countries.

The Soviet government believes that holding a summit meeting of major powers for this noble purpose would be a great contribution to the cause of peace and the security of all nations. This action would be welcomed by people of all colors, creeds, and races.

I think you will agree with my view that the current situation is such that every hour of delay poses a serious danger to the cause of peace, and all peace-loving forces should be mobilized to stop the terrible threat looming over the world. In this situation, inaction and a wait-and-see attitude may lead to disaster. We cannot and should not allow the forces of aggression and the warlike forces of colonialism to threaten peace and the security of all nations.

In the Soviet Union, it is known that India is one of the major powers, and not only Asian countries but also countries all over the world listen to its voice. The Soviet government hopes that you will do everything possible and make every effort to promote the success of the collective efforts of peace-loving countries to stop the looming disaster as early as possible, while it is still possible.

We have no doubt that peace-loving India will speak weighty words to uphold the cause for which the heroic Indian people have been tirelessly striving.

If India supports the proposal for an immediate conference and actively participates in it, it would be an immeasurable contribution to the cause of maintaining peace.

Simultaneously with this letter, we are also sending corresponding letters to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France.

                                    Sincerely yours,
                                               N. Khrushchev

### 赫鲁晓夫给尼赫鲁的信

1958-07-21
第4版()
专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫给尼赫鲁的信尊敬的总理先生，
    鉴于在中近东形成的局势，我特向您发出下列呼吁：
    由于美国侵略黎巴嫩和英国侵略约旦，我们目前正处在人类历史上的一个最严重的关头，其特点是：我们正濒临着只要一不谨慎就可能造成世界上最大的灾难的边缘。
    美国和英国对黎巴嫩和约旦采取了侵略行动后硬说，他们这种行动只带有地方性质。但是，历史证明，任何地方性战争都可能很容易变成世界大战。在估计美国和英国目前在中近东的侵略活动时，我们没有权利忘记历史的教训。
    苏联政府认为，在目前已发生了军事冲突的时候，对于维护和平负有主要责任的各国政府应当表现最大的冷静和理智，使自己的行动不致于引起世界战争。我们认为，这些政府在谋求解决问题的办法时，不应当通过寻找挑起战争狂和使世界遭到灾难的办法，而应当通过谈判的解决办法。应当要理智和冷静，以便消除战争，保证各国和平共处和世界和平。
    美国和英国武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦，是殖民主义者的老政策的继续。你们国家也曾经是这种政策的牺牲者。这种政策总是以其执行者的复灭而告终的。
    苏联政府认为，最明智的解决办法将是美国和英国的军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦领土，使这两个国家的人民有可能按照自己的愿望安排自己的命运。
    苏联政府认为，在人类历史的这个危险时刻，当要解决打不打仗这个问题的时候，必须这样做：苏联、美国、英国、法国和印度政府首脑在联合国秘书长参加下立即会晤，以采取措施停止已经发生的军事冲突。
    苏联政府建议上述国家的政府首脑7月22日在日内瓦和任何其他地方举行会晤。
    苏联政府在提议召开政府首脑会议的同时，认为这个会议在制定了关于停止中近东的冲突的具体建议之后，应把这种建议提交安理会，而安理会应当在有阿拉伯国家参加的情况下讨论这种建议。
    苏联政府认为，为了这一崇高目的而举行大国政府首脑会议，将是对和平和各国安全的事业的伟大贡献。这个行动会受到不同肤色、不同信仰和不同种族的各国人民的欢迎。
    我想您会同意我的看法的，即现在的局势是：每一小时的拖延都对和平事业孕育着严重危险，一切爱好和平的力量都应当动员起来去制止笼罩着世界的可怕威胁，在这种局势下，无所作为和观望态度可能导致灾难。我们不能、也不应当允许侵略势力、好战的殖民主义势力把和平与各国的安全置于威胁之下。
    在苏联，人们都知道印度是大国之一，不仅亚洲国家，而且全世界的国家都听取它的呼声。苏联政府希望，您能尽一切可能，全力促进爱好和平国家为了在还有可能的时候及早制止逼近的灾难而作的集体努力获得成功。
    我们不怀疑，爱好和平的印度将会讲出有份量的话，来维护英勇的印度人民一直为之不懈奋斗的事业。
    如果印度支持立即召开会议的建议并积极参加这次会议，那将是对维护和平事业的不可估量的贡献。
    与这封信的同时，我们还分别给美、英、法政府首脑发出相应的信。
                      谨致
    真诚的敬意
              尼·赫鲁晓夫
          于1958年7月19日
