    Broken Stones Can Be Glued Together
    The Chemical Engineering Group of the Physical and Chemical Laboratory of the Jiangling Machine Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a Julang (Giant Wave) brand universal glue.
    The quality of this glue is very good, and its viscosity exceeds that of various domestic brands of glue. This glue can even glue together a broken stone, and after it dries, it will be as stable as if it has taken root.

    石头断了也能粘住
    江陵机器厂理化室化工组，最近试制成功一种巨浪牌万能胶水。
    这种胶水的质量很好，粘度超过国内各牌胶水。这种胶水甚至能够把一块断了的石头粘拢来，干燥后，就像生了根一样不动摇。
