Police arrested Bonazzi and several leaders of the local Communist Party organization, as well as five participants in the rally.

India
    In the past four days, the Indian public's movement against US and British armed intervention in Middle Eastern countries has spread to more cities and towns in India, and the masses participating in the movement have become increasingly widespread.
    On the 20th, a mass rally called "Lebanon Day" was held in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala State. The Indian Communist Party leader, B. T.

Burma
    The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace held a mass rally in Yangon on the afternoon of the 22nd to support the just struggle of the people of the Middle Eastern Arab countries against US and British armed interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. The meeting passed a resolution firmly demanding that the US and British aggressor troops must immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.
    Du Ma Ma Li, Vice-Chairman of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace and a well-known female writer, said at the meeting that the Burmese people cannot stand idly by in the current struggle against imperialist interference in Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan.
