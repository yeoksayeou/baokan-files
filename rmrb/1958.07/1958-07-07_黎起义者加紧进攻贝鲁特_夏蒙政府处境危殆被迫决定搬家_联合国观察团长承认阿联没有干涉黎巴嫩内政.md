Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 6th. Damascus Radio broadcast today that the pro-Western Lebanese Chamoun government, "due to the severe situation in Beirut," has decided to move from Beirut to Dhour El Choueir. Dhour El Choueir is a small mountain town more than ten miles north of Beirut, and is the highest mountain town in Lebanon.

The radio said that this decision was made at an emergency meeting of the Lebanese cabinet held in Beirut yesterday.

It is reported that insurgents inside Beirut are increasingly approaching President Chamoun's palace and the government's location, placing the Chamoun group in a dangerous situation. Chamoun's son, Aniel Chamoun, and his daughter-in-law, already left Beirut by plane for Rome yesterday.

Beirut is also under attack from external insurgents. Damascus newspapers said that the insurgent forces advancing on the Lebanese capital from the east occupied most of the village of Shaman near Beirut International Airport yesterday.

"Al Ra'i al-'Amm" said that the Beirut insurgent forces seized many American-made bombs from the Chamoun army in the Zabadaanis district and the Aishabakara district yesterday, and these bombs will be handed over to the United Nations observers.

In addition, in Tripoli, Lebanon's second largest city in the north, insurgents engaged in sporadic battles with Chamoun's army.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 5th. According to Damascus Radio broadcasts, the head of the United Nations Observer Group, Mr. Prasada, said at a press conference held in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, on the 5th, that there is no evidence that the United Arab Republic is interfering in Lebanese internal affairs. He said that if there were any interference, it would be easy to detect.

He added, "We have investigated all the evidence provided by the Lebanese government, but none of the evidence can prove the interference of the United Arab Republic."

He said that the second report of the United Nations Observer Group will be published within ten days.

Xinhua News Agency, July 6th. Baghdad News: The Director of the Iraqi News Agency said on the 5th that the Baghdad Pact Council meeting to be held in London at the end of July will discuss the Lebanese issue and other issues in the Middle East.

It is reported that in preparation for this London meeting, the four Muslim member states of the Baghdad Pact Organization decided to hold a four-nation summit in Istanbul on July 14 first. The Muslim countries participating in the Baghdad Military Group are Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan.

Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu had consulted with the Crown Prince of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation, Abdullah, Prime Minister Nuri al-Said, and the US and British ambassadors to Turkey on the 5th respectively regarding the issue of holding the Istanbul meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 6th. The local "Al-Nour" newspaper today quoted news from the Lebanese "Al Binaa" newspaper reporting that Chamoun will sign a "defense treaty" with the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation, and the two sides will negotiate the signing of the treaty within the next forty-eight hours.

The newspaper also said that Lebanese authorities and Iraqi and Jordanian diplomatic representatives in Beirut had begun contacting each other on this issue two days ago.

Damascus' "Al Ra'i al-'Amm" commented on this news today, saying that the hidden dealings behind this treaty conspiracy are not only that imperialism is going to interfere in Lebanon, but also a threat to the United Arab Republic.

    夏蒙政府处境危殆被迫决定搬家
    联合国观察团长承认阿联没有干涉黎巴嫩内政
    新华社大马士革6日电　据大马士革电台今天广播说，黎巴嫩的亲西方夏蒙政府“由于贝鲁特局势严重”，已经决定从贝鲁特迁往杜霍雷什韦尔。杜霍雷什韦尔在贝鲁特北面十多英里，是黎巴嫩海拔最高的山上小镇。
    电台说，这个决定是昨天在贝鲁特举行的一次黎巴嫩内阁紧急会议上作出的。
    据报道，贝鲁特市内的起义者日益逼近夏蒙总统府和政府的所在地，使夏蒙集团处于危险境地。夏蒙的儿子阿尼埃勒·夏蒙和儿媳，已经在昨天乘飞机离开贝鲁特前往罗马。
    贝鲁特也遭到外部起义者的夹攻。大马士革报纸说，从东面进逼黎巴嫩首都的起义部队在昨天占领了贝鲁特国际机场附近沙曼村的大部分地区。
    “舆论报”说，贝鲁特起义部队昨天在扎巴达尼斯区和埃沙巴卡拉区缴获了夏蒙军队的许多美制炸弹，这些炸弹将交给联合国观察员。
    另外，在黎巴嫩北部第二大城的黎波里，起义者同夏蒙军队发生了零星战斗。
    新华社大马士革5日电　据大马士革电台广播，联合国观察团团长普拉萨5日在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特举行的记者招待会上说，没有任何证据表明阿拉伯联合共和国正在干涉黎巴嫩内政。他说，如果有任何干涉的话，那是容易发现的。
    他又说，我们调查了黎巴嫩政府提供的所有证据，但是没有一个证据能够证明阿拉伯联合共和国的干涉。
    他说，联合国观察团的第二个报告将在十天内公布。
    新华社6日讯　巴格达消息：伊拉克新闻局长5日说，7月底在伦敦举行的巴格达条约理事会会议将讨论黎巴嫩问题和中东的其他问题。
    据报道，为了准备这次伦敦会议，巴格达条约组织的四个穆斯林成员国决定于7月14日在伊斯坦布尔先举行四国首脑会议。参加巴格达军事集团的穆斯林国家是土耳其、伊拉克、伊朗和巴基斯坦。
    土耳其外长佐鲁5日曾就举行伊斯坦布尔会议问题，分别同伊约联邦王储阿卜杜拉、首相努里·赛义德和美英驻土耳其的大使商谈。
    据新华社大马士革6日电　此间“光明报”今天援引黎巴嫩“建设报”的消息报道，夏蒙将同伊拉克—约旦联邦签订一项“防御条约”，双方将在未来四十八小时内商谈签订条约问题。
    这家报纸又说，黎巴嫩当局与伊拉克和约旦驻贝鲁特的外交代表，已经在两天前开始就这个问题进行接触。
    大马士革“舆论报”今天在评论这个消息时说，隐藏在这个条约阴谋的背后的勾当，不仅仅是帝国主义要对黎巴嫩进行干涉，而且还有对阿拉伯联合共和国的威胁。
