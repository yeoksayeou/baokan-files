A Song of the Great Leap Forward

    The Origin of a Report
    Ye You Tang, Minfeng Paper Mill, Jiaxing, Zhejiang

    I was sitting in the factory newspaper editorial office, busy editing the manuscripts for tomorrow's published letterpress newspaper. There have been so many submissions these past few days, and almost every one of them reports good news about the factory's technological innovations. I really wish I could publish every single one, but where would I get so much space? To be honest, it's really difficult being an editor at times like these!

    I was pondering this problem when the phone rang.

    "Is that Old Ye?" the person on the other end asked as soon as I picked up the phone.

    "Yes, who is this?"

    "Come quickly, come quickly, we want to consult you about placing an advertisement."

    "Oh my, the factory newspaper doesn't run advertisements. Who are you?"

    "It's us, it's us, the entire electrical repair section. It's hard to explain over the phone, come and we'll discuss it."

    As soon as I entered the electrical repair section, I saw more than ten people gathered around a workbench, as if they were having a meeting. As soon as Section Chief Cao Dehai saw me, he couldn't wait to say to me:

    "Old Ye, the leadership has officially agreed for us to set up a 'satellite factory.' We're setting up an 'Electrical Motor Repair Factory.' Now, labor arrangements and material supplies are all ready, but no one is sending electrical equipment for us to repair, so we're asking you to discuss placing an advertisement."

    So it was about setting up a "satellite factory"!

    A few days earlier, on the first day of the workers' representative conference, the Party Secretary gave a situation report, conveying the Provincial Party Committee's report on industrial development. As soon as the report was finished, the representatives rushed back to their groups to convey it. This conveyance was like a roaring fire boiling oil, instantly causing a commotion.

    The people in the electrical repair section started discussing right after the representatives conveyed the message: set up factories, set up factories! Every additional factory adds one more point of strength to socialism! Every additional factory makes the motherland's industry bloom with one more flower!

    "But what kind of factory should we set up?" young man Yu Shun asked.

    "What kind of factory? What are we? We are electrical workers, so we should set up an 'Electrical Motor Repair Factory'!" Teacher Yu Baofu, who didn't speak much, said confidently.

    "Can we set it up? There are only sixteen of us in total. Besides normal production tasks, we also have the task of installing electrical equipment for two new papermaking machines in the fourth quarter of this year. Manpower, time, these practical problems need to be seriously considered," Cao Dehai said.

    "People, sixteen of them, time, we have 'spare time,' is that still a problem?" replied the young man Shou Xindao. He spoke simply and concisely, cleanly and neatly; Teacher Cao Dehai liked to listen to him.

    "But what about materials?" Master Cao asked with concern.

    "That's easy, the factory has plenty of stagnant materials and waste materials, just pick them up!" Yu Shun said.

    Everyone discussed like this, saying a word or two, for a long time. Finally, they unanimously agreed: the conditions are met, it can be set up.

    Just as everyone was in high spirits, technician Chen Akai suddenly raised a question: "What will our 'Electrical Motor Repair Factory' repair?" This question was really sudden and seemed kind of funny. What to repair? Lu Da quickly replied: "Hey, you're still a technician, and you're asking what an 'Electrical Motor Repair Factory' repairs! According to me, we'll repair all electrical equipment: cold, as cold as refrigerators, hot, as hot as electric heaters; high, as high as high frequency, low, as low as low voltage; big, as big as the biggest motors, small, as small as light switches; ...in short, in general, our repair factory will repair everything!"

    His statement couldn't help but make people laugh. In the end, it was still Teacher Yu Baofu who said: "Don't be unserious, Technician Chen's question is quite important. In my opinion, our main service target should be the countryside. We should repair all the electrical equipment of agricultural cooperatives. For the electrical equipment of factories in towns and cities, we should provide technical guidance if we have the conditions."

    "So, we won't be doing business with electric bellows and electric irons anymore?" someone asked jokingly in a low voice.

    Now, the preparation for the electrical repair section's "Electrical Motor Repair Factory" is definitely set, and it looks like they are about to start business. I am really happy for them. However, the matter of placing an advertisement is really making me embarrassed: advertising in the factory newspaper can only be seen by our own people, and agricultural cooperatives don't subscribe to our factory newspaper, so they won't be able to see it no matter what.

    "How about this, write down your business scope and place an advertisement in the provincial newspaper and the special zone newspaper, wouldn't that do it!" I finally came up with an idea.

    Everyone was amused by what I said. But the old man Yu Baofu didn't agree. He said: "What kind of idea is that! You are really a spendthrift! We haven't even done anything yet, and you already want to spend money, do you know how much it costs to advertise in the newspaper!"

    What he said really made me a little ashamed, how could I have come up with this crazy idea!

    Everyone was silent for a moment, thinking for a long time, without any ideas.

    Finally, it was Teacher Yu Baofu who said: "Forget it, forget it, let's not place an advertisement! Let's still write a few 'posters' like those for basketball games, and stick them in the streets and alleys of the city. There are many farmers entering the city from the east gate and the west gate, so stick a few more. Yu Shun, go write them!"

    "I have an idea, I have an idea," Shou Xindao suddenly said: "Old Ye, aren't you a correspondent for the provincial newspaper? Write a news piece, saying that our factory has set up a 'satellite factory' to repair electrical equipment for agricultural cooperatives. Once it's published in the newspaper, won't all the villages know about it! What do you think? Honestly, this matter is worth reporting..."

    Before he could finish speaking, people immediately surrounded me, scrambling to say the contents of the manuscript, and I wrote excitedly, almost forgetting the matter of getting the manuscript ready at home.

### 一篇报道的由来

    一篇报道的由来
    浙江嘉兴民丰造纸厂  叶友堂
    我坐在厂报编辑室里，忙着编发明天出版的铅印报稿子。这几天的来稿真是多，而且几乎每篇都报道厂里在技术革新上的好消息，我真恨不得能把每篇稿子都登上去，可是，哪来这么多版面呢？说实话，这个时候，做编辑的可真为难啊！
    我正踌躇在这个问题上时，电话铃响了。
    “是老叶吗？”我一拿起话筒，对方就问。
    “是，你是谁？”
    “快来，快来，我们想请教你关于登广告的事。”
    “哎哟哟，厂报又不登广告。你是谁？”
    “我，我，我们是电修工段全体。电话里说不清，你来了再商量。”
    一进电修工段，只见十多个人围着一张工作台，像是在开会。工段长曹德海一见我，就迫不及待地对我说：
    “老叶，领导上已经正式同意我们办‘卫星厂’。我们办的是‘电机修配厂’。现在，劳动力安排和材料供应都已筹备就绪，可就是没有人送电气设备来修，所以请你来商量，登一个广告。”
    原来是办“卫星厂”的事！
    在早几天，开职工代表大会的第一天，党委书记在会上作了形势报告，传达了省委关于工业发展的报告。报告一完，代表们就赶忙回小组传达。这一传达，就像猛火烧滚油，一下子沸腾了起来。
    电修工段的人就在代表们传达后接着讨论开了：办工厂，办工厂，多办一个工厂，社会主义多增一分力量！多办一个工厂，祖国的工业多开一朵鲜花！
    “可办什么厂呢？”小伙子于顺问。
    “办什么厂？我们是什么人？我们是电气工人，就办‘电机修配厂’！”不多讲话的郁宝富老师傅胸有成竹地说。
    “办得起来吗？我们一共只有十六个人，除正常生产任务外，今年四季度还有两台新造纸机的电气设备安装任务，人力，时间，这些实际问题要郑重考虑。”曹德海说。
    “人，十六个，时间，有‘业余’，这还成问题？”寿信道这小伙子回话了。他说话，简单扼要，干净利落；曹德海老师傅就愿听他的。
    “可是材料呢？”曹师傅为难地说。
    “这省事，厂里多的是呆滞材料和废料，捡去嘛！”于顺说。
    大家就这样，你一言我一语地议论了好久，最后，一致同意：条件具备，可以办起来。
    正在大家兴高采烈的时候，技术员陈阿楷突然提出了个问题：“咱们这个‘电机修配厂’修配什么呢？”这个问题提得真是又突然又似乎令人好笑。修什么？吕达赶忙回答：“嘿，还是技术员呢，‘电机修配厂’修什么也会问！依我说，凡是电气设备，咱们统统修理：冷，冷到电冰箱，热，热到电热；高，高到高频，低，低到低压；大，大到最大的马达，小，小到电灯开关；……总而言之，统而言之，咱们这个修配厂，什么都修！”
    他这一说，人们都禁不住笑了起来。最后，还是郁宝富老师傅说：“别不真不假，陈技术员这问题提得挺重要。我看，咱们的服务主要对象应该是农村，凡农业社的电气设备，一应修理。城镇的工厂电气设备，咱们有条件，就来个技术上指导。”
    “那么说，电风箱，电熨斗的生意是不做的了？”有人风趣地轻声问。
    现在，电修工段的“电机修配厂”筹备定当了，看样子他们是要开始营业，我真替他们高兴。可是，这登广告的事，倒真有些使我为难：厂报上登广告只能给自己人看，农业社又不订咱们厂报，他们无论如何是看不见的。
    “这样吧，把你们的业务范围写一写，在省报和专区报纸上登一个广告，不就得了吗！”我总算想出办法了。
    我这一说，大伙可乐了。但郁宝富这老头却不赞成。他说：“你这算是什么主意！真是败家子！咱们事情还没做，你就想破钞啦，你知道报上登广告要花多少钱！”
    他这一说，我真有些惭愧了，怎么会想出这个鬼办法来呢！
    大伙也刹时沉寂下来，想了半天，没有主意。
    末了，还是郁宝富老师傅说：“算啦，算啦，不登广告啦！还是写几张同篮球比赛一样的‘海报’，城内大街小弄去贴一贴，东门和西门农民进城的多，多贴几张。于顺，去写吧！”
    “有了，有了，”寿信道突然说：“老叶，你不是省报通讯员吗？写一个消息，说咱们厂办了一个‘卫星厂’，为农业社修理电气设备。报纸一登，各乡各村不就都知道了吗！你看怎么样？老实说，这个事也值得报道一下吧……”
    他话还没说完，人们立时簇拥着我，你一句我一句地抢着说稿子的内容，我兴奋地写着，差点儿把家里等着发稿的事都忘了。
