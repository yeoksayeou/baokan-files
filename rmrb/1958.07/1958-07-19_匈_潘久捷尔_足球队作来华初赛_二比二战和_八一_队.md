　　Hungarian "Pécsi Dózsa" Football Team Makes Debut in China
　　2-2 Draw with "August 1st" Team
　　(Our newspaper correspondent Guo Jia reports) The Hungarian "Pécsi Dózsa" football team, which arrived in Beijing on the 16th, played a friendly match against China’s "August 1st" football team yesterday in Beijing. The result was a 2-2 draw.
　　Vice Premiers He Long and Nie Rongzhen watched yesterday’s match.
　　After the match started, the "August 1st" team quickly launched an offensive, with three fierce shots on goal in the first two minutes, posing a great threat to the visiting team. However, the "Pécsi Dózsa" team, with its versatile tactics, quickly broke free from the passive situation. The five forwards advanced in unison, besieging the goal of the "August 1st" team, creating many dangerous situations in front of the home team's goal. "August 1st" goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen was quick-eyed and quick-handed, saving many dangerous shots. Around the twentieth minute of the match, the "August 1st" team launched another offensive, with the forwards and midfielders pushing past the halfway line, penetrating deep into the opponent's penalty area. In the melee, the visiting team's right back, Molnar, inadvertently touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty kick. Wang Xiwu, the right midfielder of the "August 1st" team, took the penalty kick and scored, opening the scoring.
　　The "August 1st" team took advantage of the momentum to attack. Left winger Cui Hengxie and right winger Pan Peigen frequently switched positions, taking several powerful shots near the opponent's penalty area, but they were all saved by the visiting team's experienced goalkeeper, Szabadkai.
　　At the start of the second half, the "Pécsi Dózsa" team tried to reverse the defeat. They adjusted their lineup to strengthen their attack, with the original left inside forward, Bálpály, being reassigned as center forward. In the sixth minute, the visiting team's right inside forward, Molnar, received the ball near the "August 1st" team's penalty area and shot. Huang Zhaowen pounced outwards with the ball, but the ball slipped out of his hands and was swept into the net by the visiting team's center forward, Bálpály. The score became 1-1.
　　The "Pécsi Dózsa" team became more and more courageous, with one attack after another. After ten minutes, the visiting team had the opportunity to take a corner kick. They lightly lobbed the ball in front of the net, and center forward Bálpály judged the incoming ball and headed it into the net. The score on the field became 2-1, with the visiting team leading.
　　After that, the match became even more tense. In order to reverse the defeat, the "August 1st" team brought on Ha Zengguang as center forward, and the original center forward, Gao Junshi, was reassigned as defender, which immediately changed the situation. In the last fifteen minutes of the match, the entire offensive was almost entirely controlled by the "August 1st" team.
　　As the end of the match approached, the atmosphere on the field became even more tense. The "Pécsi Dózsa" team began to "defend to the death", adopting a dense defensive tactic to deal with the "August 1st" team's sharp offensive. Goalkeeper Szabadkai repeatedly made meritorious contributions, saving more than ten dangerous shots in total. In the last minute, "August 1st" team's left winger Cui Hengxie received the ball and shot it powerfully into the net. This goal saved the "August 1st" team from defeat.
　　In the entire match, the "August 1st" team had a total of 24 shots on goal, and the "Pécsi Dózsa" team had a total of 13 shots on goal. The visiting team's excellent skills and sportsmanship during the match were warmly applauded by the audience.
　　On the 20th, the "Pécsi Dózsa" football team will play a friendly match against the Beijing football team.

    匈“潘久捷尔”足球队作来华初赛
    二比二战和“八一”队
    本报讯　记者郭家报道：十六日到达北京的匈牙利“潘久捷尔”足球队昨天在北京同我国“八一”足球队举行了一场友谊比赛。结果二比二握手言和。
    贺龙和聂荣臻副总理观看了昨天的比赛。
    比赛开始后，“八一”队迅速展开攻势，两分钟内，就连续三次急劲射门，给客队威胁很大。但是战术变化多端的“潘久捷尔”队很快地摆脱了被动局面，五前锋齐头并进，围攻“八一”队的大门，主队门前险象环生。“八一”守门员黄肇文眼快手快，救出不少险球。比赛进行到二十多分钟时，“八一”队攻势又起，前锋和前卫全压过半场，深入对方禁区。混战中，客队右后卫莫尔纳尔不慎手触球，被判罚球点球。“八一”队右前卫王锡文主罚，一蹴中的，首开纪录。
    “八一”队乘胜进攻，左翼崔亨燮和右翼潘培根经常交叉换位，在对方禁区附近多次劲射，但都被客队有经验的守门员萨巴德卡依救出。
    下半场比赛开始，“潘久捷尔”队力图扭转败局。他们调整阵容加强进攻力量，原来的左内锋鲍尔波里改任中锋。六分钟时，客队右内锋莫拉尔在“八一”队禁区附近得球射门，黄肇文连人带球向外扑出，不料球又脱手，被客队中锋鲍尔波里赶上猛扫一脚进网。比数成一比一。
    “潘久捷尔”队越战越勇，攻势一个接着一个。过了十分钟，客队得发角球的机会，将球轻吊网前，中锋鲍尔波里看准来球顶入网。场上比数成二比一，客队领先。
    以后，比赛就更趋紧张，“八一”队为了要挽回败局，调上哈增光担任中锋，原中锋高筠时调任后卫，局势顿时改观。在最后十五分钟比赛中，整个攻势几乎全被“八一”队掌握。
    快终场了，场上气氛更形紧张，“潘久捷尔”队开始“死守阵地”，采用密集防守战术，对付“八一”队的锐利攻势。守门员萨巴德卡依屡屡建功，前后共救出了十多个险球。最后一分钟时，“八一”队左边锋崔亨燮接得来球后，举足劲射入网。这一球挽回了“八一”队的败局。
    在全场比赛中，“八一”队共射门二十四次，“潘久捷尔”队共射门十三次。客队在比赛过程中表现出的优良技术和道德作风，获得了观众们的热烈掌声。
    20日，“潘久捷尔”足球队将同北京足球队举行友谊比赛。
