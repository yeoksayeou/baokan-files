    A New Atmosphere on the Theoretical Front
    Currently, our country's Marxist-Leninist theoretical front is showing an unprecedentedly vibrant new atmosphere. This new atmosphere has emerged on the basis of the great victory achieved in the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, and the subsequent great leap forward in industry and agriculture.
    The most significant feature of the current new atmosphere in theoretical work is the close integration of theoretical work with practical work, and the mass-based upsurge in studying Marxist theory and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. At present, people are striving to implement the principle of combining the universal truth of Marxism with China's specific practice in their theoretical study or research, and believe that the primary purpose of studying theory is to study the theoretical problems raised by the current socialist construction practice. Many theoretical publications and articles resolutely criticize various bourgeois ideologies and wage an irreconcilable struggle against Yugoslavian modern revisionism. People's understanding of the harm of dogmatism has been greatly improved, and thorough criticism has been carried out against dogmatic thinking in various departments and in theoretical work. Empty and abstract rhetoric has been greatly reduced, and the dull and superstitious atmosphere of dogmatism has been fundamentally changed. The principle put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong in "Reform Our Study" in 1941, that cadre education "should establish a policy of taking the study of practical problems of the Chinese revolution as the center, and the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism as the guide, and abolish the method of studying Marxism-Leninism statically and in isolation," has been implemented in the theoretical courses of Party schools, cadre schools, and universities. In short, what is now presented to us is that theoretical work is truly full of revolutionary creative spirit and critical spirit, and full of the vigorous combat effectiveness and infinite vitality inherent in Marxism. It is particularly worth noting that Party committees at all levels have greatly strengthened their leadership over theoretical work, with many secretaries taking personal command, and theoretical publications are springing up like mushrooms after a rain. In addition, not only leading cadres are required to study and learn theory, but also grassroots cadres and the broad masses of workers and peasants are eager to learn theory. The workers of Mudanjiang Cement Plant put forward such a heroic slogan: "We must turn the cement plant into not only a factory, but also a university, and also a Marxist-Leninist college." After cadres in Sanguanmiao Township, Dengfeng, Henan Province, studied philosophy, "there was more investigation and research, less subjectivism, and the mass viewpoint was strengthened." The fact that workers and peasants can study theory well completely overturns the mystical view of studying theory. This upsurge in studying theory will not only enlighten the wisdom of the masses and rapidly improve the level of awareness of cadres and the masses, but also bring great impetus to theoretical work.
    The emergence of this unprecedentedly active situation in China's theoretical work is not accidental. The Party-wide and nationwide rectification movement that began last year was another great ideological revolution and ideological liberation movement after the 1942 rectification movement. The rectification and anti-Rightist struggle are also socialist revolutions on the political and ideological fronts after the basic solution of the problem of ownership of the means of production in our country. This revolution has given a decisive blow to bourgeois ideology and greatly raised the political consciousness of cadres and the masses. In these movements, people have realized the importance of putting politics in command, that in order to win the complete victory of the socialist cause, it is necessary to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology, and that it is necessary to strive to eliminate all remnants of the influence of the exploiting system in people's minds. It must be pointed out here that the dogmatic thinking in past theoretical work was partly due to the "left" one-sidedness in the way of thinking, and partly due to the influence of bourgeois ideology. That kind of dogmatism that sticks to conventions and is divorced from reality cannot answer the new questions raised by the advancing situation, so without criticizing dogmatism, it is impossible to conduct an effective struggle against bourgeois ideology. In the rectification movement, people restudied Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on what is theory and what is a theorist, criticized the erroneous mentality of "fearing professors" and "fearing old experts," which gave theoretical work a correct direction. At the same time, the great leap forward in socialist construction has raised a large number of theoretical issues, such as the theoretical basis for the great leap forward and construction speed of industry and agriculture in our country, the integration of industry and agriculture, the integration of education and productive labor, how to implement the mass line in the technological revolution and cultural revolution, how to deeply carry out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, how to continuously improve socialist relations of production to adapt to the development of productive forces, and how to rapidly create the conditions for the transition from socialist society to communist society in our country, all of which require theoretical work to provide answers. At the same time, in the face of the unprecedented great leap forward in the development of social productive forces and the lessons of the past "saddle-shaped" development, people have further realized that not only must we win victory in the struggle between the two roads, but we must also win victory in the struggle between the two methods, and in the struggle between advanced and backward ideas. People realize that if we cannot completely eliminate all the outdated concepts that hinder the development of social productive forces, and cannot completely break all the erroneous ideas that bind the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people, we will not be able to keep up with the rapidly changing situation, and we will fall behind the masses, and not only will we not be able to be promoters, but we will also be in danger of becoming regressives. In this way, it is completely understandable that people are eager to learn Marxist-Leninist theory in order to summarize the experience of the mass struggle, grasp objective laws, promote the faster advancement of the socialist construction cause, and strive to reduce mistakes on the road forward.
    This new atmosphere is extremely valuable. It portends that Marxist theoretical research and publicity work will be further greatly developed in our country. Those who have any doubts about this are just short-sighted people who are ignorant of new things. The tremendous development of theoretical work in our country is inevitable, and there are sufficient objective grounds for it. First of all, the Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, is good at combining the universal truth of Marxism with specific practice, and constantly makes many extremely important contributions to the development of Marxist-Leninist theory. Comrade Mao Zedong's prefaces and notes to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and other works, are the ideological and theoretical basis of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and are the ideological and theoretical basis of the great leap forward in our country. These great theoretical works have raised and solved theoretical problems of fundamental significance under new historical conditions. Comrade Mao Zedong's entire works are a unity of high revolutionary spirit and high scientific spirit, so it can point out the correct direction for the proletarian cause, bring people infinite encouragement and inspiration, and thus bring immeasurable huge impetus to the actual struggle. The contributions of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee to Marxist-Leninist theory are the most important favorable conditions for the theoretical research work and theoretical propaganda work in our country to achieve continuous creative development. Secondly, the current situation of the great leap forward in our country, with ten thousand horses galloping and soaring spirit, is in full swing. The creative enthusiasm of the people of our country is erupting like the splitting of atomic nuclei. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, 600 million Chinese people will surely create countless miracles. Theoretical work must undertake its due task in the construction struggle of the people of our country to catch up with Britain in fifteen years or less at a high speed. "Practice produces theory." The current great construction upsurge in our country has provided the most fertile soil for the great leap forward in theoretical work, and the problem depends on our subjective efforts. Theoretical work, like other work of the Party, will surely achieve great development as long as we adhere to the Party's mass line. The movement to write ten thousand pieces of experience or articles proposed by Hebei Province, the movement to write "ten thousand articles and a thousand books" proposed by the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, the plan of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee to organize a team of ten thousand theoretical course instructors, and the plan of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee to organize a team of fifteen thousand theoretical course instructors, are a manifestation of full confidence in the "blooming of a hundred flowers" in theoretical work. Third, the current theoretical team has been greatly strengthened. A large number of responsible Party cadres care about and personally engage in theoretical work, write articles, and give lectures in universities or other schools, and they form the strongest core force of the theoretical team. Party cadres in charge at all levels have the most advantageous conditions for doing a good job in theoretical work in terms of practical struggle and understanding of the actual situation. Their involvement in theoretical work can completely overcome the dogmatic habits in theoretical work and greatly strengthen the combat power of the theoretical front. At the same time, the full-time theoretical work team and teaching team have also received profound education in the rectification and anti-Rightist movement, criticized the past dogmatic errors and the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, and many people have been sent down to rural factories to receive labor training and practical work training, and are working hard towards the direction of being both red and expert. Finally, Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over theoretical work, which is the most important guarantee for the rapid development and achievement of theoretical work.
    The situation is unprecedentedly good, and the favorable conditions are also sufficient. The theoretical work team must go all out and aim high so as to play its due role in the struggle of the whole Party and the entire people to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. That is to say, theoretical work must continue to advance and must never become a lame, backward. We have full confidence in this. Because the Party's general line is guiding us forward, as long as we adhere to the correct direction, theoretical work will surely achieve remarkable results. Comrade Liu Shaoqi made important instructions on the direction of efforts in theoretical work in the political report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress. He said: "We should completely liberate ourselves from the shackles of dogmatism and empiricism, so that our thinking and work can achieve lively and vigorous development. We should respect the practice of the masses, respect the revolutionary spirit and creativity of the masses, and this is respecting materialism and respecting dialectics. We should learn from Comrade Mao Zedong and many other comrades who are connected with the masses (including a large number of leading figures of the Party and the masses at all levels, central, provincial, regional, county, and township), learn from their example of applying Marxism-Leninism and applying dialectics and materialism in their actual work at all times, learn from their example of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, combining the serious spirit of principle with the lively spirit of originality, and learn from their example of being with hundreds of millions of people, seeing the right direction, grasping the truth, and fighting for the truth, being as unstoppable as a broken bamboo, and being invincible." All theoretical workers should conscientiously study and practice these instructions, improve their understanding, and take various measures to strive for the continuous advancement of theoretical work.

    理论战线上的新气象
    目前我国马克思列宁主义理论战线上，出现了空前活跃的新气象。这种新气象，是在整风运动和反右派斗争取得伟大胜利，和随之而来的工农业大跃进的基础上出现的。
    当前理论工作新气象最显著的特征，就是理论工作和实际工作紧密结合，就是学习马克思主义理论，学习毛泽东同志的著作，成为群众性的热潮。目前，人们在学习理论或理论研究工作中，都努力实现着把马克思主义的普遍真理和我国具体实践相结合的原则，并且认为学习理论的首要目的就是为了研究当前社会主义建设实践中所提出的理论问题。许多理论刊物和文章，坚决地批判各式各样的资产阶级思想，并且对于南斯拉夫现代修正主义展开了不调和的斗争。人们对教条主义危害性的认识已经大为提高，对各部门工作中和理论工作中的教条主义思想，都开展了彻底的批判。空洞抽象的调头已经大为减少，教条主义的沉闷空气和迷信空气已经根本得到改变。毛泽东同志1941年在“改造我们的学习”中说的，干部教育“应确立以研究中国革命实际问题为中心，以马克思列宁主义基本原则为指导的方针，废除静止地孤立地研究马克思列宁主义的方法”，已经在党校、干校和高等学校的理论课程中贯彻下去。总之，现在呈现在我们面前的，是理论工作真正充满了革命的创造精神和批判精神，充满了马克思主义所固有的旺盛的战斗力和无穷的生命力。特别值得注意的，就是各级党委都大大加强了对理论工作的领导，许多书记亲自挂帅，理论刊物像雨后春笋似地涌现。另外，现在不仅领导干部要求研究和学习理论，基层干部和广大的工农群众，也迫切要求学习理论。牡丹江水泥厂的工人提出这样豪迈的口号：“要把水泥厂变成既是工厂，也是大学，也是马列学院”。河南登封三官庙乡干部学了哲学之后，“调查研究多了，主观主义少了，群众观点加强了”。工农能够很好地学习理论，这一事实就把对学习理论的神秘观点完全推翻了。这个学习理论的热潮不仅会启发群众的智慧，迅速提高干部和群众的觉悟水平，还会给理论工作带来极大的推动力。
    我国理论工作这种空前活跃局面的出现，并不是偶然的。去年开始的全党全民的整风运动，是继1942年整风运动之后的又一次伟大的思想革命和思想解放运动。整风和反右派斗争，又是我国在生产资料所有制问题基本解决之后在政治战线思想战线上的社会主义革命。这个革命给了资产阶级思想以决定性的打击，大大提高了干部和群众的政治觉悟。人们在这些运动中认识到政治挂帅的重要性，认识到要争取社会主义事业的彻底胜利，就必须灭资产阶级思想，兴无产阶级思想，认识到必须努力在人们心理上消灭剥削制度影响的一切残余。这里必须指出，过去理论工作中的教条主义思想，有的是由于思想方法上的“左”的片面性，有的却是资产阶级思想影响的表现。那种墨守成规、脱离实际的教条主义，不能回答形势向前推移所提出的新问题，所以，不批判教条主义，就不能和资产阶级思想进行有效的斗争。人们在整风运动中重新学习毛泽东同志关于什么是理论、什么是理论家的指示，批判了“怕教授”
  “怕老专家”的错误心理，这就使理论工作获得了正确的方向。同时，社会主义建设事业的大跃进，提出了大量的理论问题，例如，关于我国工农业大跃进和建设速度的理论根据问题，关于工业和农业结合问题，关于教育和生产劳动结合问题，关于在技术革命和文化革命中如何贯彻群众路线、如何深入展开兴无灭资斗争的问题，关于如何使社会主义的生产关系不断完善以适应生产力的发展问题，关于如何在我国迅速地创立从社会主义社会向共产主义社会过渡的条件等问题，都要求理论工作作出答案来。同时，人们在社会生产力的发展空前大跃进和过去“马鞍形”发展的教训面前，进一步认识到不仅要在两条道路的斗争中取得胜利，还必须在两种方法的斗争中、在先进思想和落后思想的斗争中取得胜利。人们认识到：如果我们不能把一切妨碍社会生产力发展的陈腐观念都彻底破除，不能把一切束缚人民群众革命积极性的错误思想都彻底打破，我们就会赶不上一日千里的形势，就会落在群众的后面，不仅不能当促进派，还有变成促退派的危险。这样，人们迫切要求学习马克思列宁主义的理论，以便总结群众斗争的经验，掌握客观规律，推动社会主义建设事业更快地前进，并且力求减少前进道路上的失误，这是完全可以理解的。
    这个新气象极为可贵。它预示马克思主义理论研究工作和宣传工作将在我国进一步得到巨大的发展。对这抱有任何怀疑态度的，只是一些目光短浅对新事物懵然无知的人。我国理论工作必然会获得巨大的发展，是有着充分的客观根据的。首先，以毛泽东同志为首的党中央，善于把马克思主义的普遍真理和具体实践结合起来，对马克思列宁主义理论的发展，不断作出许多极为重大的贡献。毛泽东同志的“中国农村的社会主义高潮”的序言和按语，“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”等著作，是鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的思想理论基础，是我国大跃进的思想理论基础。这些伟大的理论著作，提出了并且解决了新的历史条件下具有根本意义的理论问题。毛泽东同志的全部著作，是高度革命性和高度科学性的统一，所以，它能为无产阶级事业指出正确的方向，带给人们以无限的鼓舞和启示，从而带给实际斗争以不可估计的巨大推动力量。毛泽东同志和党中央对马克思列宁主义理论的贡献，是我国理论研究工作、理论宣传工作能够取得不断的创造性发展的最重要的有利条件。其次，我国目前万马奔腾，气概冲天的大跃进形势，正在方兴未艾。我国人民的创造热情正像原子核破裂时那样迸发出来了。六亿中国人民在中国共产党领导下，必将创造出无数的奇迹。理论工作在我国人民完成在十五年或更短时间内赶上英国的高速度的建设斗争中，必须担负起自己应该担当的任务。“实践出理论”，我国当前伟大的建设高潮，已经给理论工作的大跃进提供了最肥沃的土壤，问题就决定于我们的主观努力了。理论工作和党的其它工作一样，只要我们坚持党的群众路线，就一定会得到巨大的发展。河北省所提出的写万篇经验或文章的运动，山西省委提出写作“万篇文章、千本书”运动，江西省委提出组织一万人的理论课程教员队伍，湖南省委提出组织一万五千人的理论课程教员队伍的规划，就是对于理论工作必然出现“万花齐放”的繁荣局面，具有充分信心的表现。第三，当前的理论队伍，已经极大地加强了。大批的党的负责干部关心并且亲自动手搞理论工作，写文章，到高等学校或其它学校去讲课，他们形成了理论队伍最坚强的核心力量。党的各级负责干部，在实际斗争的锻炼方面，在对于实际情况的了解方面，具有搞好理论工作的最优越的条件。他们动手抓理论工作，就能够彻底克服理论工作中的教条主义习气，大大加强理论战线的战斗力量。同时，专职理论工作队伍和教学队伍，也在整风反右运动当中，受到了深刻的教育，批判了过去教条主义的错误和资产阶级的思想影响，并且许多人已经下放到农村工厂中接受劳动锻炼和实际工作的锻炼，正在向着又红又专的方向努力。最后，各级党委都加强了对于理论工作的领导，这是理论工作能够迅速开展和取得成绩的最重要的一项保证。
    形势是空前的好，有利条件也是充分的，理论工作队伍，必须鼓足干劲，力争上游，以便在全党和全体人民群众多快好省地建设社会主义的斗争中发挥自己应起的作用。这就是说，理论工作要不断地前进，决不应该成为跛脚的，落后的。我们对于这一点是具有充分信心的。因为，党的总路线在引导着我们前进，只要我们坚持正确的方向，理论工作必将获得显著成果。关于理论工作努力的方向，刘少奇同志在八大第二次会议政治报告中作了重要的指示。他说：“我们应当从教条主义和经验主义的束缚下彻底解放出来，使我们的思想和工作获得生动活泼的发展。我们应当尊重群众的实践，尊重群众的革命性和创造性，这才是尊重唯物论，尊重辩证法。我们应当向毛泽东同志和其他联系群众的许多同志（其中包括中央，省、地、县、乡各级党的和群众的大批领袖人物）学习，学习他们在实际工作中时时刻刻应用马克思列宁主义、应用辩证法和唯物论的榜样，学习他们把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合、把严肃的原则精神同生动的独创精神相结合的榜样，学习他们同亿万群众在一起、看到了正确方向、抓住了真理、就为真理而奋斗、势如破竹、所向披靡的榜样。”一切理论工作者都应该认真学习和实践这些指示，提高认识，采取各种措施，争取理论工作不断地前进。
