Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 15th. The CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee held a New and Improved Agricultural Implement Technical Innovation Conference from the 8th to the 13th, focusing on solving the problem of creating more than promoting, paying attention only to improvement and neglecting popularization.

The meeting believes that promotion is the key issue in the current agricultural implement improvement movement. According to calculations by relevant departments in Zhejiang Province, all kinds of agricultural work throughout the province require a total of 3.8 billion workdays, with each agricultural laborer averaging 380.9 days of work per year. The vast number of farmers in the province have tried every means to solve the problem of labor shortage, especially by finding ways and offering suggestions for improving agricultural implements. In the past six months, they have achieved great results. Farmers, handicraftsmen, and workers have created, imitated, and improved more than 4,000 kinds of agricultural implements, and promoted more than 10 million pieces. During the summer harvest and planting, a new upsurge of agricultural implement reform has been launched. However, due to the ideology of waiting for mechanization among some cadres, pursuing large-scale and novel designs, and believing that mechanization is imminent and that improved agricultural implements will not be useful for long, they are not active in improving agricultural implements. In addition, some people look down on the role of improved agricultural implements, are unwilling to replace the old with the new, and find it troublesome. Still others seek large-scale and comprehensive solutions, demanding perfection in the inventions and creations of the masses. They do not promote them if they see even slight shortcomings, which affects the enthusiasm of the masses. There are also some people who turn a blind eye to the creations of the masses and turn a deaf ear to the urgent demands of the masses, so that some good improved agricultural implements have not been promoted in a timely manner. Ruian County successfully created a bamboo-splitting machine as early as 1953, and Hubei Province learned from it and vigorously promoted it, but some areas in Zhejiang did not even know about it and were still exploring and creating, wasting time and manpower. The meeting specifically pointed out that the above-mentioned ideas are the main obstacles to the current vigorous promotion of new and improved agricultural implements. This link must be broken through before the inventions and creations of the masses can blossom all over the province.

This meeting greatly promoted the importance attached to the reform and promotion of agricultural implements by cadres from the handicraft, agricultural, and commercial systems attending the meeting. Representatives from various places immediately set their own creation and promotion targets and measures, and expressed their intention to continue mobilizing the masses to carry out the "Three Contributions" (contributing ideas, materials, and labor), "Three Selfs" (self-financing, self-building, self-use), and "Three-izations" (diversification, popularization, and simplification) movement.

In order to better lead this mass agricultural implement reform movement, Zhejiang Province established an Agricultural Implement Reform and Promotion Committee, with Li Fengping, Secretary of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee Secretariat, as the director; the CPC committees of various cities, prefectures, and counties have also successively established similar institutions.

People's Daily, Changsha, 15th. Hunan is closely integrating with the urgent needs of current production, vigorously creating and promoting various new agricultural implements and processing tools, and a new upsurge has emerged in the province's agricultural technology innovation movement.

In the past short three or four months, Hunan Province has created and improved more than 7,000 kinds of production tools, irrigation and drainage tools, transportation tools, and agricultural and sideline product processing tools, and promoted more than 4 million pieces. More than 20 counties in the province have basically achieved transportation "vehicularization" and "shipping." Due to the improvement of tools, the improvement of operating methods, and the improvement of labor efficiency, the province has saved about 680 million labor days, ensuring the implementation of various yield-increasing technical measures.

At present, the province has entered a tense season of rushing to harvest early rice and rushing to transplant late rice. Many places, based on current needs, have deeply mobilized the masses to carry out tool reform, and vigorously and rapidly promote various effective new agricultural implements and processing tools. The Shaoyang Prefecture proposed to eliminate old-fashioned rice bins in the entire area, and universally promote rice threshers, animal-powered universal rotary machines, and reed rolling rakes. It is required that during the early rice harvest period, 50,000 rice threshers, 11,000 universal rotary machines, and 35,000 reed rolling rakes be promoted.

    推广——当前农具改革的关键
    浙江省委批判坐等机械化、忽视普及的思想
    湖南省推广大量新农具节省了大量劳动力
    新华社杭州15日电　中共浙江省委员会在8日到13日召开了新式和改良农具技术革新会议，着重解决创造多推广少，只注意提高而忽视普及的问题。
    会议认为，推广是当前农具改良运动中的关键问题。据浙江省有关部门计算，全省全年各种农活合计需要三十八亿工，平均每个农业劳动力一年要做三百八十点九天的活。全省广大农民曾千方百计来解决劳力不足的问题，特别是在改良农具上想办法出主意，半年来已取得巨大成绩，广大农民、手工业者和工人共创制、仿制和改良了四千多种农具，推广了一千多万件：夏收夏种中，又掀起了农具改革的新高潮。但是，由于在一部分干部中存在着坐等机械化思想，贪大求新，认为马上要机械化了，改良农具没有几天好用，因而对改良农具不积极；另外一部分人看不起改良农具的作用，不肯去旧换新，认为麻烦；再有一部分人求大求全，要求群众的发明创造完美无瑕，看到稍有缺点，就不推广，影响了群众的积极性；还有一些人对群众的创造熟视无睹，对群众的迫切要求不闻不问，以致有些好的改良农具没有得到及时推广。瑞安县早在1953年就创造成功劈篾机，湖北省学去大加推广，可是浙江有的地区反而不知道，还在摸索创造，浪费了时间和人力。会议特别提出：上述思想是当前大力推广新式和改良农具的主要障碍，必须突破这一环节，群众的发明创造才会在全省各地开花。
    这次会议大大促进了到会的手工业、农业、商业等系统的干部对农具改革和推广工作的重视，各地代表当场就订出自己的创造、推广的指标和措施，表示继续发动群众，开展三献（献计、献料、献力）、三自（自筹、自建、自用）、三化（多样化、普通化、简单化）运动。
    为了更好地领导这一群众性的农具改革运动，浙江省成立了农具改革推广委员会，由中共浙江省委书记处书记李丰平任主任委员；各市、地、县委也已陆续设立了同样的机构。
    本报长沙15日电　湖南各地正在紧密结合当前生产的迫切需要，大力创造与推广各种新式农具和加工工具，全省农业技术革新运动出现了新的高潮。
    在过去短短的三、四个月内，湖南省即创造和改良生产工具、排灌工具、运输工具和农副产品加工工具等达七千多种，推广了四百多万件。全省已有二十多个县基本上实现了运输“车子化”和“船运化”。由于改良工具，改进操作方法，提高了劳动效率，全省约节省六亿八千多万个劳动日，保证了各项增产技术措施的贯彻执行。
    目前全省已进入抢收早稻、抢插晚稻的紧张季节。许多地方根据当前需要，都深入发动群众，进行工具改革，并用大力迅速推广各种行之有效的新式农具和加工工具。邵阳专区提出在全区消灭旧式扮桶，普遍推广打稻机、畜力万能转盘机和蒲滚踩耙。要求在早稻收割时期，推广打稻机五万部，万能转盘机一万一千部，蒲滚踩耙三万五千部。
