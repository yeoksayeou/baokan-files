Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Grain production experts who have created world-shaking high yield records from all over the country met with agricultural scientists in Beijing to exchange experiences. Agricultural science units and bioscience research institutions have stated that they will seize the red flag of highest yield records from agricultural cooperatives. Chen Fengtong, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, issued an urgent appeal to agricultural science workers: the current situation of agricultural scientific research lagging behind agricultural production cannot continue. The "local" experts from the fields also refused to show weakness, confidently stating that they must maintain the red flag and not allow scientific units to surpass them. During the exchange of experiences, they learned from each other's strengths and made up for their weaknesses, and the measures became more and more numerous and better. Therefore, the targets for grain and cotton yields per mu proposed by everyone continued to increase.

More than 6,700 mu of rice in the Xicheng Agricultural Cooperative in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, and 68 mu of rice in the Agricultural Science Department of the People's Committee of Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, have large-area yield targets of up to 20,000 jin per mu next year. 1,000 mu of wheat in the Lemin Agricultural Cooperative in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, 1,000 mu of wheat in the New Atmosphere No. 5 Cooperative, 1,000 mu of wheat in the Victory Agricultural Cooperative in Nanhe County, Hebei Province, 240 mu of wheat in the Dongniujiaomiao Village Agricultural Cooperative in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, 60 mu of wheat in the Hanjiawa Cooperative in Ding County, Hebei, and 25 mu of wheat in the Agricultural Science Department of the People's Committee of Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, will all achieve an average yield of 10,000 to 12,000 jin per mu on a large area next year. More than 1,000 mu of cotton in the New Atmosphere No. 5 Cooperative in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, 800 mu of cotton in the Lemin Agricultural Cooperative, 500 mu of cotton in the Pidong No. 1 Cooperative in Liu'an County, Anhui Province, more than 4,000 mu of cotton in the May 1st Agricultural Cooperative in Yongnian County, Hebei Province, and 100 mu of cotton in the Yongfeng Cooperative in Beijing will all have a large-area yield of 2,000 jin (lint) per mu next year. The annual yield targets of the experimental fields of the above units even exceed the large-area yield targets.

The high yield test group jointly formed by eight units of the Department of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences have both put forward very high yield targets for experimental fields. The large-area yield targets for grain and cotton in the 1,800 mu of fields in the Beijing and Shijiazhuang experimental farms of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences next year are 10,000 jin and 1,000 jin (lint) respectively. The target for 1,000 mu of wheat in the Beijing Agricultural University Farm next year is an average yield of 10,000 jin per mu.

Both local and foreign experts believe that as long as they closely rely on the leadership of the Party, learn from the advanced experience of the broad masses of production models, and apply the latest scientific achievements, these amazing targets are achievable.

Peasant production experts and scientists have designed detailed technical measures to ensure the completion of these advanced targets. Some agricultural cooperatives are preparing to apply 1.2 million jin of fertilizer per mu and plow deeply to a depth of five or six chi. The director of the New Atmosphere No. 5 Cooperative in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, proposed sowing 150 jin of wheat per mu in the wheat experimental field (in the past, only 10 to 20 jin of wheat were sown), because of the high-density planting, there will be no "standing room for an awl" on the land. He boldly envisioned conducting field aerial management operations, setting up cables on the field, and having people operate and dispatch in hanging baskets. Scientists have proposed using new scientific achievements such as carbon dioxide fertilization, antibiotics and growth hormones, and nighttime lighting. Regardless of "foreign" experts or "local" experts, they have all come to the realization that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with politics in command, minds liberated, superstitions broken, and full effort exerted, the power of man over nature is infinite. The unprecedented high-yield records that have already appeared and the even greater high-yield records that will appear have made many of the original knowledge and methods of agricultural scientists no longer applicable. After listening to the introduction of the high-yield experience of the "local" experts, an agricultural expert decided to cancel some research projects, because these projects have been solved by production experts in practice. The "local" experts have also put forward many new topics to the scientific workers, and they very much hope that agricultural experts will use scientific theory to solve the technical problems in production. Due to the leap forward in agricultural technology, producers' demands for scientific theory have reached an urgent stage.

"Local" experts and "foreign" experts are not only full of revolutionary competitive spirit, but also hope to support each other, learn from each other's strengths, and make up for each other's weaknesses. Everyone feels that foreign and local must be combined in order to make high-yield records continue to leapfrog.

Yu Guangyuan, Director of the Science Department of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, proposed at the meeting that scientific workers should put forward more specific high-yield measures; all research results related to crop high yields should be taken out, such as excellent varieties, which are one of the most urgent problems to be solved at present. Yu Guangyuan believes that the purpose of carrying out high-yield experimental fields is not only for the product itself, but more importantly to establish a direction for advancement, so that the people of the whole country can break superstitions and gain a harvest in their thinking; the second is to find various specific technical measures; and the third is to promote the agricultural science revolution.

This meeting was convened by the All-China Federation of Scientific Societies and the Beijing Federation of Scientific Societies. The participants included high-yield experts from more than 20 agricultural cooperatives in various provinces and scientific workers from more than a dozen scientific and educational institutions. It started on July 5th and closed on July 9th. Fan Changjiang, Secretary-General of the State Council Science Planning Commission, was invited to make a concluding speech at the end of the meeting. He said: This meeting is completely in line with the spirit of the general line, and everyone's enthusiasm is getting higher and higher; due to the exchange of experiences, there are more and more methods, and the confidence is getting stronger and stronger. The current level of agricultural high yield in our country is already the highest level in the world in many aspects, which fully reflects the communist spirit of Chinese farmers. This meeting also reflects the call of the Party Central Committee for the technical revolution to follow the mass line. Fan Changjiang said that we should firmly believe in the courage and wisdom of workers, peasants, youth and other broad masses of people. In the technical revolution, theory is not unnecessary, but more necessary and more welcomed by the masses; the high-yield experts from all over the country who attended the meeting are all red flags in the country and new experts. They have practical experience and also attach great importance to scientific theory issues. They have great expectations for the old experts; the old experts should strive to transform their thinking, serve socialist construction wholeheartedly, and strive to improve their professional level; the combination of new experts and old experts, and the combination of experts and the masses will surely lead to a greater leap forward in production. Fan Changjiang encouraged everyone to let go and work hard with full confidence.

On the evening of the 11th, Vice Premier Deng Zihui received the high-yield experts from all over the country who attended the meeting, listened to their reports on high-yield measures, and gave them important instructions.

    让粮帅展开土洋两翅大飞跃
    粮食丰产能手和农业科学工作者们会师北京交流经验
    双方比干劲争取明年棉粮亩产分别达到二千和二万斤
    新华社11日讯　全国各地创造震惊世界的粮食丰产纪录的生产能手同农业科学工作者在北京举行了交流经验的会议。农业科学单位和生物科学研究机关表示要把丰产最高纪录的红旗从农业社里夺过来。中国农业科学院副院长陈凤桐向农业科学工作者发出了紧急呼吁：农业科学研究工作落后于农业生产的现状，不能再继续下去。来自田间的“土”专家们也决不示弱，信心百倍地表示一定要保住红旗，不让科学单位超过。在交流经验过程中，互相取长补短，措施越来越多，越来越好，因此大家提出的明年粮食和棉花丰产指标不断提高。
    江苏省句容县西城农业社六千七百多亩水稻和江苏常熟县人民委员会农业科的六十八亩水稻，明年大面积丰产指标都高达亩产二万斤，湖北谷城县乐民农业社一千亩小麦、新气象五社一千亩小麦、河北省南和县胜利农业社一千亩小麦、邢台县东牛角庙村农业社二百四十亩小麦、河北定县韩家洼社六十亩小麦、江苏常熟县人民委员会农业科二十五亩小麦，明年都要达到大面积丰产平均每亩一万斤到一万二千斤。湖北谷城县新气象五社一千多亩棉花、乐民农业社八百亩棉花、安徽六安县淠东一社五百亩棉花、河北永年县五一农业社四千多亩棉花、北京永丰社一百亩棉花，明年大面积丰产都将为每亩二千斤（皮棉）。上述各单位试验田的年丰产指标，还超过了大面积丰产指标。
    中国科学院生物学部在北京的八个单位联合组成的丰产试验组和中国农业科学院都提出了很高的试验田丰产指标。农业科学院北京、石家庄试验场明年一千八百亩田的粮食和棉花大面积丰产指标分别为一万斤和一千斤（皮棉）。北京农业大学农场一千亩小麦明年指标平均亩产一万斤。
    土专家和洋专家们都认为只要紧紧依靠党的领导，学习广大生产模范的先进经验，应用最新科学成就，这些惊人的指标是有把握达到的。
    农民丰产能手和科学工作者都设计了周密的技术措施来保证这些先进指标的完成。有的农业社准备每亩施肥一百二十万斤，深耕五、六尺。湖北谷城县新气象五社主任提出小麦试验田每亩下种一百五十斤（过去一般小麦只下种一、二十斤），因为高度密植，田地上将无“立椎之地”。他大胆设想进行田间空中管理操作，在田上架起缆索，人坐在吊篮中操作调度。科学家们提出要采用二氧化炭施肥、用抗生素生长素、夜间照明等新科学成果。不论“洋”专家和“土”专家，都得到了这样一个认识：在英明的共产党和毛主席的领导下，政治挂帅，解放了思想，破除了迷信，鼓足了干劲，人力对于自然的作用是无穷尽的。已经出现的旷古未闻的丰产纪录以及将要出现的更大的丰产纪录，使农业科学工作者原有的许多知识和办法已经不适用。一个农学专家听了“土”专家的丰产经验介绍后，决定取消一些研究课题，因为这些课题已经被生产能手在实践中解决了。而“土”专家们也向科学工作者提出了许多新课题，他们很希望农学专家们用科学理论来解决生产中的技术问题，由于农业技术的跃进，生产者对科学理论的要求已经到了迫切的地步。
    “土”专家和“洋”专家不但充满了革命竞赛的干劲，同时也都希望互相支援，取长补短，大家感到洋土必须结合，才能使丰产纪录不断跳跃式地上升。
    中共中央宣传部科学处处长于光远在会上提出，要求科学工作者提出更多的具体丰产措施；要把一切有关作物丰产的研究成果拿出来，例如优良品种便是目前迫切需要解决的问题之一。于光远认为搞丰产试验田，目的不仅仅是为了产品本身，更重要的是为了树立前进方向，使全国人民破除迷信，在思想上获得丰收；第二是找出各种具体的技术措施；第三是推动农业科学革命。
    这次会议是全国科联和北京科联召集的。参加的有各省二十多个农业社的丰产能手和十几个科学、教育机关的科学工作者等。从7月5日开始到7月9日闭幕。国务院科学规划委员会秘书长范长江应邀在会议最后作了总结性发言。他说：这个会完全合乎总路线的精神，大家干劲越来越大；由于交流了经验，办法越来越多，信心越来越足。我国现在的农业丰产水平在不少方面已经是世界上最高的水平，这充分体现了中国农民的共产主义气概。这次会也体现了党中央的技术革命必须走群众路线的号召，范长江说，我们应坚决相信工人、农民、青年和其他广大群众的勇敢和智慧，在技术革命中，理论不是不需要而是更加需要、更加受到群众欢迎了；到会的来自各地的丰产能手都是全国的红旗，是新的专家，他们有实际经验，同时也很重视科学理论问题，他们对老专家们期望很大；老专家们应努力改造思想，全心全意为社会主义建设服务，并努力提高自己的业务水平；新专家和老专家结合起来，专家和群众结合起来，生产必定会有更大的飞跃。范长江勉励大家放手地去干，信心百倍地去干。
    11日晚上，邓子恢副总理接见了参加会议的各地丰产能手，听取他们汇报了丰产措施，并且对他们作了重要指示。
