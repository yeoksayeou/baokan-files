Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 21st. Last night, 20,000 people from all walks of life in Hangzhou held a grand torchlight parade. Slogans such as "American troops get out of Lebanon!" and "British troops get out of Jordan!" resounded throughout the West Lake area.

Prior to the demonstration parade, a protest rally was held. Many people came to the meeting early without eating dinner. Many members of the Nanshan Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs came to the meeting from the fields, putting down their hoes and sickles. Wang Zida, Secretary of the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on the people of the city to turn anger into strength, resolutely oppose the war provocations of American and British imperialism with practical actions, and fully support the just struggle of the Arab people.

In recent days, more than 300,000 people in Hangzhou have gathered and marched separately. Cartoons and slogans have been posted everywhere in shop windows throughout the city. Propaganda teams performed ditties and living newspapers on the streets. Many residents wrote big-character posters, expressing their determination to support the Arab people with practical actions.

    愤怒的声音响彻西子湖畔
    杭州两万人举行火炬游行
    新华社杭州21日电  杭州市各界人民两万人昨晚举行盛大火炬游行，“美国军队滚出黎巴嫩！”“英国军队滚出约旦！”等口号声响彻了整个西子湖畔。
    在示威游行以前，举行了抗议大会。许多人晚饭未吃就提前赶来开会。郊区南山农业社许多社员从田里回家，放下锄头镰刀就到会场。中共杭州市委书记王子达在会上号召全市人民化愤怒为力量，坚决以实际行动反对美英帝国主义的战争挑衅，全力支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。
    连日来，杭州市已有三十多万人分别集会和游行。全市街道橱窗到处都贴上了漫画和标语。宣传队伍在街头上演出小调、活报剧等节目。许多居民写了大字报，表示坚决以实际行动声援阿拉伯人民。
