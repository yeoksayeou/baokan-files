Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 9th: In Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, a contingent of worker-writers has taken shape and is constantly growing. Tens of thousands of workers throughout the city participate in literary creation, with over a thousand regularly publishing their works in newspapers and magazines at a relatively high level. In addition to the city-level publications "Worker's Works" and "Mass Art," many districts, industrial unions, and factories have also published their own literary journals. According to incomplete statistics, Shanghai workers have created over one million literary works of various forms in the first half of this year.

Since this spring, amateur literary activities among Shanghai workers have developed to an unprecedented scale, with hundreds of thousands of people participating. Some factories have nearly everyone involved, with performances every day and evening parties every week. Workers are clear about the direction of their creative popularization: writing about labor, writing about workers, writing about the advanced, writing about struggle, serving the current political and production tasks. Now, in many factories, creative activities follow wherever advanced deeds are, and creative activities follow wherever problems in production are. Some factories create miracles in the morning, have works recited on the radio at noon, and have performances in the evening, playing the role of literary mobilization. Some expose problems in production, and workers immediately create and perform, playing the combat role of literature.

While popularizing, Shanghai also pays attention to improving the work of cultivating worker-writer teams. The first is to promote collective creation, absorb mass opinions through publication and "performance" for reprocessing, so that the work reaches a certain level in the process of mass modification and processing. The second is to focus on performances and competitions. Whenever a movement comes to an end, performances and competitions are carried out level by level from the factory to the district and city, and amateur authors and professional authors combine to carry out processing and improvement. Recently, the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace held a city-wide worker drama, skit, and recitation performance, and selected sixteen excellent works from seventy-seven works for another performance, and finally processed a batch of relatively mature scripts. In addition, the literary and art circles have also strengthened guidance on worker creation in various aspects. "Literary Monthly" also published a "Special Issue on Shanghai Worker Creation." This "Special Issue" has 180,000 words and a total of 41 novels, features, and scripts written by workers. Many of these works vividly depict the spiritual outlook of Shanghai workers, shape many typical workers in the Great Leap Forward, and each has its own style and a fairly high artistic level.

In cultivating the worker-writer team, Shanghai especially emphasizes the leadership of the Party committee, putting politics in command, strengthening the political education of workers who love creation, emphasizing that the first priority is to be good in politics and good in production, and then good in creation, emphasizing the need to write about people with communist style, and that one must first have a communist style. It opposes the viewpoints of being divorced from politics, divorced from reality, and divorced from the masses, as well as the idea of pursuing fame and profit, so that the worker-writer team can grow healthily along the socialist literary and art line.

    写劳动  写工人  写先进  写斗争
    上海培养工人文艺创作队伍
    据新华社上海9日电  在我国最大的工业城市上海，一支工人文艺创作队伍已经形成并在不断发展壮大。全市参加文艺创作的工人数以万计，水平较高经常在报刊上发表作品的有一千多人。全市除出版了市一级的“工人习作”和“群众文艺”外，许多区、产业工会和工厂也出版了自己的文艺刊物。据不完全的统计，上海工人在今年上半年创作的各种形式的文艺作品，已有一百万篇以上。
    今春以来，上海工人中的业余文艺活动，发展到了空前未有的规模，参加的人数达到数十万人，有的工厂几乎人人参加，天天有演出，周周有晚会。工人们在创作普及中方向明确：写劳动，写工人，写先进，写斗争，为当前的政治任务和生产任务服务。现在许多工厂内都是：先进事迹在哪儿，创作活动便跟到哪儿，生产中的问题在哪儿，创作活动也跟到哪儿。有的工厂上午创造了奇迹，中午就有作品在广播台上朗诵，晚上就有演出，发挥了文艺的鼓动作用。有的揭发了生产中的问题，工人也马上创作和演出，发挥了文艺的战斗作用。
    在普及的同时，上海在培养工人文艺创作队伍中，还注意提高工作。首先是提倡集体创作，通过发表“演出”吸收群众意见再加工，使作品在群众性的修改、加工过程中达到一定水平。其次是抓会演、抓评比。每当运动告一段落，从工厂到区和市，逐级进行会演评比，业余作者和专业作者相结合，进行加工提高。最近上海工人文化宫举行全市工人话剧、活报、朗诵会演，从七十七个作品中选出十六个优秀作品，再一次举行会演，最后加工出一批相当成熟的剧本。另外文艺界也从各个方面加强对工人创作的辅导。“文艺月报”还出版了“上海工人创作专号”，这个“专号”有十八万字，共有四十一篇工人们写的小说、特写和剧本，其中有许多作品都生动地刻划出上海工人的精神面貌，塑造了许多大跃进中工人的典型，而且各有风格，具有相当高的艺术水平。
    上海在培养工人文艺创作队伍中，特别强调党委领导，政治挂帅，加强对爱好创作的工人的政治教育，强调首先要政治好，生产好，然后是创作好，强调要写共产主义风格的人，自己先要有共产主义风格。反对脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众的观点和追求名利的思想，使工人文艺创作队伍沿着社会主义文艺路线健康地成长。
