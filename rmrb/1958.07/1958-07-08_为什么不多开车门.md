    Why Not Open More Doors?
    On the evening of May 24th, when Train No. 262 from Taiyuan to Datong was approaching Huangzhai Station, twenty or thirty passengers in our carriage were preparing to get off. Huangzhai Station is a small station with a very short stop time. Therefore, when the passengers saw that only one door was open, they were worried about the crowd and not being able to get off the train, so they requested the conductor to open the other door as well. However, the conductor ignored the passengers' requests. When the train entered the station, the passengers crowded to get off the train, which was very inconvenient because it was dark and the door was high off the ground. At this time, the conductor only shouted loudly that the train would only stop for one minute and urged people to get off quickly, but he did not open the other door. As a result, less than half of the people had gotten off the train when it started moving. It is very inappropriate for such a thing to happen on Train No. 262 in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward.

    为什么不多开车门
    5月24日晚上，由太原开往大同的第二六二次列车快到黄寨车站时，我们车厢里有二、三十位旅客准备下车。黄寨车站是个小站，停车时间很短。因此，当旅客们看到只开了一个车门时，担心人多拥挤，下不去车，于是要求列车员把另一个车门也打开。但是，列车员对旅客的意见置之不理。列车进了站，下车旅客都挤着下车，因为天黑，车门离地面又高，下车很不方便。这时，列车员光大声喊只停车一分钟，快下车，却不把另一个车门打开。结果还没有下完一半，火车就开动了。有一位妇女带着小孩下了车，孩子的外婆却没下来。在大跃进的高潮中，二六二次列车还发生这种事是很不应该的。
