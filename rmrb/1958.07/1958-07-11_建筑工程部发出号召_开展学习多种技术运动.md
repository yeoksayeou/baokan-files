Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Electric Dispatch The Ministry of Construction Engineering recently convened a national exchange meeting in Taiyuan on construction workers learning "multi-skilled" experiences. The meeting systematically summarized and exchanged the experiences of "multi-skilled workers" and believed that construction workers across the country should take the movement of "everyone learning to be multi-skilled, machines capable of doing multiple jobs" as an important part of the current technological innovation.

Representatives of construction workers from twenty-four provinces and autonomous regions across the country listened to Shen Zhong, acting director of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Construction, about the situation of carrying out "multi-skilled" work in the Shanxi region, as well as the typical experiences introduced by units such as Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and Taiyuan Engineering Bureau. They unanimously agreed that "multi-skilled workers" are an important way to solve the shortage of construction forces and the insufficient application of mechanical capabilities in the Great Leap Forward. At present, a mass movement to learn "multi-skilled" has formed in the Taiyuan area. According to statistics from eight units, including Taiyuan Water Supply and Drainage Engineering Company, the number of employees who have mastered two to six or more skills currently accounts for 72% of the total number of employees.

Many regional representatives accepted the experience of the Taiyuan area and found a good way to solve the problem of insufficient manpower and the poor connection between types of work within construction enterprises. Representatives from Xi'an and Qinghai said at the discussion that they originally planned to solve the problem of labor shortage by "recruiting soldiers and buying horses," but now they believe that promoting "multi-skilled workers" is a quick and effective method.

The representatives attending the meeting also believed that promoting "multi-skilled workers" can not only maximize the subjective initiative of workers in production, but also adjust the relationship between people within the enterprise with the cooperation between types of work. In the past, due to the detailed division of labor, dozens of types of work were carried out simultaneously in the same space, often forming a phenomenon of mutual disturbance and disputes between upper and lower procedures and between types of work. The implementation of "multi-skilled workers" can eliminate these phenomena.

Some regional representatives originally worried that after workers learned multiple skills, it would affect their mastery of professional skills and lead to the phenomenon of "biting off more than one can chew," but after listening to the introduction of "multi-skilled workers" and visiting the site, they felt that "multi-skilled workers" have rich vitality among the masses, which has powerfully promoted the technological innovation movement. Employees who have learned to be "multi-skilled" have expanded their knowledge fields and become more open-minded, thus enabling them to use professional skills more creatively.

Song Yuhe, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, analyzed the great significance of "multi-skilled workers" at the closing ceremony of the conference. He called on construction workers across the country to launch a upsurge in learning the "multi-skilled" movement, and required all regions to make plans for promotion based on specific circumstances, and cultivate a team of construction workers who are both red and expert with good political qualities and high technical levels.

At the meeting, representatives of employees from nineteen construction units, including North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau and Hongzhao County Engineering Team, jointly launched a proposal to construction units across the country to promote "multi-skilled workers" and make a big splash in technological innovation. The guarantee they put forward is: strive to have all workers learn five or more new technologies by the end of this year on the basis of mastering the "three-skilled" technology of existing workers, and reach an average technical level of grade three to grade five workers. This proposal received enthusiastic support from the representatives attending the meeting.

### 建筑工程部发出号召  开展学习多种技术运动

    建筑工程部发出号召
    开展学习多种技术运动
    据新华社太原电　建筑工程部最近在太原召开了全国建筑工人学习“多面手”经验交流会。会议系统地总结交流了“多面手”的经验，并且认为全国建筑业职工应该把开展“人人学多面手、机器能干多种活”的运动作为当前技术革新的重要内容。
    来自全国二十四个省、自治区的建筑业职工代表，听取了山西省建设厅代厅长沈重关于山西地区开展“多面手”的情况报告，以及太原钢铁厂、太原工程局等单位的典型经验介绍以后，一致认为“多面手”是解决大跃进当中建筑力量不足和机械能力不敷应用的重要办法。目前太原地区已经形成一个学习“多面手”的群众性的运动。据太原给水排水工程公司等八个单位统计，掌握了两种到六种以上技术的职工，目前已经占职工总数72％。
    许多地区代表接受了太原地区的这个经验，找到了解决人力不足和建筑企业内部工种之间不能很好衔接的好办法。西安、青海地区代表在讨论会上说，他们原打算以“招兵买马”的办法解决劳力不足的问题，现在认为推行“多面手”是立竿见影的办法。
    到会代表们还认为，推行“多面手”，不仅在生产上能更大限度地发挥工人的主观能动作用，而且随着工种之间的协作，还调整了企业内部人与人之间的关系。过去由于工种分工很细，几十个工种在同一空间同时施工，常常形成上下工序之间、工种之间互相打扰、互相争执的现象；实行“多面手”以后，就可以消除这些现象。
    有些地区代表原来还疑虑工人学会了多种技术以后，会影响精通专业技术和产生“贪多嚼不烂”的现象，但是听了“多面手”的介绍和现场参观以后，感到“多面手”在群众中有丰富的生命力，它有力地推动了技术革新运动；学会“多面手”的职工扩大了知识领域，思想更加开阔了，因而更能创造性地运用专业技术。
    建筑工程部副部长宋裕和在大会闭幕式上分析了“多面手”的重大意义以后，号召全国建筑业职工掀起一个学习“多面手”运动的热潮，并且要求各地区根据具体情况，作出推行的规划，培养出一批有良好政治素养和高度技术水平的又红又专的建筑队伍。
    在会上，华北太原工程局、洪赵县工程队等十九个建筑单位的职工代表，联名向全国各地建筑单位发起了推广“多面手”、大闹技术革新的倡议。他们提出的保证是：争取在现有工人掌握“三面手”技术基础上，到今年年底全部工人学会五种以上新技术，并且平均达到三级到五级工的技术水平。这个倡议受到到会代表的热烈支持。
