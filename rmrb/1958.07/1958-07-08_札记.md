    Jottings
    Be Sensible
    The French weekly "L'Observateur" recently published an article stating that after the Algerian people solemnly rejected De Gaulle's annexation policy, the French government attempted to salvage its colonial rule in Algeria by intensifying military operations. Officers of the French colonial army have requested reinforcements of 150,000 to 200,000 troops to fight the Algerian insurgents.
    Can the deployment of reinforcements reverse the French colonial army's defeats on the Algerian battlefield? "L'Observateur" answered this question with historical facts in its article: "It should not be forgotten that despite the continuous increase of French troops in Algeria over the past four years, we have only been able to hold our own. Adding more reinforcements will not be decisive."
    However, this article did not mention what increasing the army means for France's finances. Currently, the cost of maintaining the French colonial army in Algeria has brought France's finances to the brink of bankruptcy. If another 150,000 to 200,000 troops are added, the massive military expenditure will be beyond the capacity of France's finances to bear.
    Therefore, those colonialists who blindly believe in force should be sensible. Increasing the army will not intimidate the Algerian people, but will only bring greater disaster to France.
    Hateful Thing
    According to news reported in American newspapers, Dulles plans to visit Brazil in August this year. American newspapers also revealed that Brazilian workers, in order to protest the United States' policy of aggression against Latin American countries, are preparing to launch a large-scale anti-American demonstration and plan to launch a 24-hour general strike to "welcome" Dulles. Given this situation, Dulles's future trip to Brazil may not be smooth sailing.
    Ever since U.S. Vice President Nixon tasted the bitterness of rotten eggs, spit, and stones in South America, any U.S. official thinking of visiting Latin America cannot help but be alarmed by the rising tide of anti-American sentiment among the people of these countries. Not long ago, U.S. President Eisenhower's brother postponed his visit to Central American countries for this very reason. Now, as soon as Dulles opens his mouth to say he is preparing to go, he is met with strong opposition from the Brazilian people. This shows how hateful the American imperialists have become in the eyes of the people of Latin American countries.

    札记
    识相些吧
    “法兰西观察家”周刊最近发表了一篇文章说，在阿尔及利亚人民严正地拒绝了戴高乐的并吞政策以后，法国政府就企图用加强军事行动来挽救它在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治。法国殖民军队的军官们已经要求增派十五万到二十万人的援军来和阿尔及利亚的起义者作战。
    增派援军是不是能够扭转法国殖民军队在阿尔及利亚战场上的败局呢？“法兰西观察家”在这篇文章里用历史事实作了答复：“不应该忘记，尽管四年来阿尔及利亚法国军队不断增加，可是我们也仅仅有招架之力。再增加援军并不具有决定性意义。”
    可是，这篇文章还没有提到，增加军队对法国的财政意味着什么。目前，在阿尔及利亚法国殖民军队的维持费用，已经使得法国财政濒于破产。如果再增加十五万到二十万军队，庞大的军费开支更是法国财政所无力负担的了。
    因此，那些迷信武力的殖民主义者还是识相些吧。增加军队决吓不倒阿尔及利亚人民，而只会给法国带来更大的灾难。
    可恨的东西
    据美国报刊所载的消息说，杜勒斯打算在今年8月间去巴西进行访问。美国报刊还透露，巴西的工人为了抗议美国对拉丁美洲国家的侵略政策，准备掀起一个声势浩大的反美示威游行，并打算发动一次二十四小时的总罢工来“欢迎”杜勒斯。照这种情形看来，杜勒斯未来的巴西之行未必一帆风顺了。
    自从美国副总统尼克松在南美饱尝了臭鸡子、唾沫和碎石块的滋味以后，任何一个想到拉丁美洲去访问的美国当权人物，都不能不对这些国家人民反对美帝国主义的高涨情绪感到胆战心惊。前不久，美国总统艾森豪威尔的弟弟推迟访问中美国家，就是由于这个缘故。现在杜勒斯刚一启齿说准备去，就遭到巴西人民的强烈反对。这说明美帝国主义者在拉丁美洲各国人民的心目中已成为多么可恨的东西了。
