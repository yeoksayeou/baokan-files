    Looking at Two Worlds from Two "Showcases"
    Tan Wenrui
    Since the Brussels World's Fair opened in April, tens of thousands of people from all over the world have come to visit every day. Among the pavilions at this expo, two are the most eye-catching: the Soviet Pavilion and the American Pavilion. These two pavilions attract the most visitors not only because of their grand scale, but also because they are "showcases" of the two major countries in different worlds. People can see a microcosm of the peaceful competition between two social systems within them.
    The exteriors of the Soviet Pavilion and the American Pavilion are very different. The Soviet Pavilion covers an area of more than 270,000 square feet and is over 70 feet high. The entire building is constructed of glass and aluminum, displaying a majestic and powerful beauty. The American Pavilion is also quite large and the architecture is quite elaborate, but its structuralist architectural style gives a feeling of superficiality. Some say it looks like a birthday cake covered in cream.
    As for the content of these two pavilions, it is even more different.
    The Soviet Pavilion is divided into eighteen sections, which orderly present a beautiful picture of the vigorous development of the Soviet economy and the rapid progress of science, technology, and culture. When a visitor enters the Soviet Pavilion, he is first attracted by two golden statues more than ten feet tall. On the left is a steelworker holding a shovel, and on the right is a peasant woman holding a wheat sheaf. These two huge statues seem to remind visitors: you are visiting the achievements of a socialist country where workers and peasants are the masters. In this front hall, people can see vivid information about the Soviet Union's geography, population, natural resources, social structure, and other aspects. This information shows that the Soviet Union has all the resources that may exist in the world, that all wealth in this country belongs to all the workers who create them, that there is no racial discrimination in this country, and that every Armenian and every Russian enjoys the same rights... And especially important are the documents showing the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy, which convincingly show how the Soviet Union is making unremitting efforts to strive for lasting world peace.
    The central hall is the exhibition hall of industry and agriculture, where various new achievements in Soviet industrial and agricultural production are displayed. People can see the latest machines for various production purposes, see models of the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydropower Station and other large-scale industries, and see many of the latest industrial products, which show the Soviet Union's strong industrial production capacity and high degree of automation. In agriculture, people can not only see how collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations have ensured the leap-forward development of Soviet agricultural production, but also see how 90 million acres of wasteland have been reclaimed into fertile land within a few years. The area of these lands is equivalent to the total cultivated land area of France, Italy, West Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain combined. These exhibits show the amazing creativity of people living in a socialist country where productive forces have been liberated.
    There are two particularly attractive exhibits in the central hall, which are the models of the two artificial satellites that marked the beginning of mankind's conquest of outer space. These two models are exactly the same size and structure as the two red moons launched by the Soviet Union into space to orbit the earth. The radio transmitter, various scientific instruments, and the "bedroom" of the dog "Laika" installed in the second artificial satellite can be clearly seen. These crystallizations of the Soviet Union's advanced scientific and technological achievements are admired and praised by tens of thousands of visitors every day.
    But it is not only these two things that show the great power of Soviet science and technology. In another science pavilion and an atomic energy exhibition hall, people can also see many of the latest scientific and technological inventions, such as the model of the world's largest nuclear fission synchronous phase-stable accelerator, the model of the world's first atomic power station, the model of the world's first atomic icebreaker, various electronic computers, meteorological rockets for detecting the upper atmosphere, and a full set of equipment for scientific research stations in the Arctic... Seeing these things, people will naturally come to the conclusion that Soviet science and technology have climbed to the highest peak in the world.
    Other parts of the Soviet Pavilion show that all production labor in the Soviet Union is completely devoted to continuously improving the people's lives. From the exhibits of the construction industry, the transportation industry, the light industry, and the food industry, people can see that the Soviet people are living a better life day by day. What interests visitors is not only the colorful fabrics, the dazzling array of food, the very comfortable workers' residences, the latest-style cars, the models of magnificent underground train stations, etc., but also the most convincing statistics: In 1956, the Soviet people consumed twice as much meat, nine times as much milk, twenty-two times as much silk, eight times as much wool, and ten times as much knitwear than in 1932. In 1956 alone, the Soviet people received 1.1 million new homes from the state...
    The Soviet people not only have a material living standard that is improving year by year, but also their ever-growing cultural needs are constantly being met. In the exhibition sections on literature, art, education, sports, and medical health, people can see how every Soviet person in this socialist country is being cultivated into a cultured socialist citizen, how literature and art are thriving along the path of socialist realism, how the people's health is being taken care of by the state with meticulous care, how children are being loved, and how women are being truly liberated... All of this is so enviable for some people living in capitalist countries under the threat of unemployment and poverty!
    A visitor from Argentina wrote down his impressions: "After seeing the Soviet Pavilion, I am deeply convinced that the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system." This view is obviously not just the impression of this one visitor. However, after they visit the American Pavilion, this belief will definitely be strengthened.
    The American Pavilion is more like a curio cabinet of a quirky collector and a small department store than an exhibition hall of a country. The exhibits inside are so empty and mediocre! Upon entering, people see some inexplicable things: car license plates from various places in the United States, trademarks of various alcoholic beverages, or menus from many restaurants... These exhibits may be to show that the United States is the country with the most severe alcoholism and the most car accidents in the world, then what do the statue of the god of death carved from rotten wood, or the three shriveled corns placed in a glass cabinet, and some strangely shaped glasses mean? It is really confusing. Then the visitors will be guided into a gallery, where the four walls are covered with some modern paintings, here is a pile of colors, there is a bunch of intersecting lines, if you don't look at the author's name, people will definitely think they are all masterpieces of the chimpanzee painter "Betsy," who was once famous in the American art world. This is the art of America today! When a visitor thinks he is still touring the gallery, he has actually entered the American Geophysical Year exhibition room. There is neither the wreckage of the "Vanguard" rocket nor the model of the "Explorer" artificial satellite, only some bizarre wall decorations that are as bizarre as modern works. Someone is using a commercial advertising-like tone from the loudspeaker to promote the achievements of the United States in the Geophysical Year, and there are few audiences.
    Of course, there is not nothing serious in the American Pavilion. For example, people can also see a model of an atomic power station, a model of an atomic-powered ship that has not yet been built, some electronic computers, and scientific instruments that apply isotopes. However, all these things combined can only show that the level of American science and technology has fallen far behind the Soviet Union.
    As for the second floor of the exhibition hall, it seems even more poor and vulgar. The exhibits on this floor are divided into two parts. One part is arranged as a typical American street, with a store selling women's fashion, a pharmacy selling sleeping pills and aspirin, a coffee shop selling Coca-Cola and other beverages, and a book stall selling detective novels and yellow magazines... Since a typical American street is like this, then it is not difficult for people to imagine what a typical American lifestyle is like. The other part on the second floor is a chaotic display of some electrical refrigerators, plastic utensils, children's toys, and other daily necessities, and the goods are not as complete as those in a second-rate department store in Brussels.
    However, all of this is what a visitor can see in the American Pavilion. Some people who admire the United States may be disappointed. But it is actually not surprising at all. The American Pavilion accurately reflects the current situation of economic depression, cultural and educational decline, and backward science and technology in the United States.
    From these two "showcases," people can see the two different paths and different prospects that the two worlds are taking. Socialist countries are moving forward vigorously, and capitalist countries are declining day by day. No force can change this reality and trend. (Attached pictures)

### 从两个“橱窗”看两个世界

    从两个“橱窗”看两个世界
    谭文瑞
    布鲁塞尔世界博览会自4月开幕以来，每天有着数以万计的来自各国的人们前来参观。在这博览会中有两个展览馆最引人注目，这就是苏联展览馆和美国展览馆。这两个展览馆所以最吸引观众，不仅因为它们的规模最宏大，而且因为它们是两个不同世界中最主要国家的“橱窗”，人们在这里面可以看到两种社会制度和平竞赛的缩影。
    苏联展览馆和美国展览馆的外貌就是很不一样的。苏联展览馆占地面积二十七万多平方英尺，高七十多英尺，整座建筑用玻璃和铝建成，显示出一种庄严而富有力量的美。美国展览馆的规模也不算小，建筑也相当讲究，但是它那结构主义的建筑风格，给人一种虚浮的感觉。有人说它活像一块浇上奶油的生日蛋糕。
    至于这两个展览馆的内容，那就更是迥然不同了。
    苏联展览馆一共分成十八个部分，它有序地呈现出一幅关于苏联经济蓬勃发展和科学、技术、文化飞速进步的美丽图景。当一个参观者走进苏联展览馆的大门，他就会首先被两座三丈多高的金黄色的雕像所吸引住，左面的是一个手握铁铲的炼钢工人，右面的是一个抱着麦束的农妇，这两座巨大的雕像仿佛提醒参观者：你正在参观一个由工人和农民当家作主的社会主义国家的成就。就在这个前厅里，人们可以看到有关苏联地理、人口、自然资源、社会结构等各方面的生动资料，这些资料说明了苏联有着世界上可能有的一切资源，说明了在这个国家里全部财富属于创造它们的全体劳动者，说明了在这个国家中没有任何种族歧视，每一个亚美尼亚人和每一个俄罗斯人享有着同样的权利……而特别重要的是那些表明苏联和平外交政策的文件，它们使人信服：苏联是如何为了争取世界的持久和平进行着不懈的努力。
    中央大厅是工业和农业的展览馆，这里面陈列着苏联工业和农业生产的各种新成就。人们可以看到各种不同生产用途的最新式的机器，看到世界最大的古比雪夫水电站和其他大型工业的模型，看到许多最新的工业产品，它们显示出苏联强大的工业生产能力和生产的高度自动化。在农业方面，人们不但看到集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站怎样保证了苏联农业生产的飞跃发展，还可以看到九千万公亩荒地怎样在几年之内被开垦成为良田，这些土地的面积相当于法国、意大利、西德、奥地利、比利时、荷兰、西班牙的全部耕地面积的总和。这些展览品说明，在生产力获得了解放的社会主义国家中生活的人们有着何等惊人的创造力。
    在中央大厅里有着两件特别吸引人的展品，这就是标志着人类征服宇宙空间的开端的两个人造卫星的模型。这两个模型是和苏联发射到宇宙空间围绕着地球运行的两个红月亮的大小、构造完全一样的，第二个人造卫星中所安置的无线电发报机、各种科学仪器和小狗“莱伊卡”的“卧室”都可以清清楚楚地看到。这两颗苏联先进科学技术成就的结晶，每天受到成千上万参观者瞻仰和赞叹。
    但是显示出苏联科学技术的巨大力量的不仅是这两件东西。在另外一个科学馆和一个原子能展览馆中，人们还能看到许多最新的科学和技术发明，例如世界最大的核子分裂同步稳相加速器的模型、世界最早建成的原子发电站的模型、世界第一艘原子破冰船的模型、各种各样的电子计算机、探测大气高层的气象火箭、以及在北极进行科学研究的观测站的全付设备等……看到了这些东西，人们自然而然会得出这样的结论：苏联的科学技术已攀登世界的最高峰。
    苏联展览馆中的其他部分，表明了在苏联进行的全部生产劳动完全服务于不断改善人民生活的目的。从建筑工业、运输工业、轻工业、食品工业等的展览品中，人们可以看得出苏联人民在过着一天比一天好的生活。引起参观者兴趣的，不仅是那些五色缤纷的衣料、琳琅满目的食品、十分舒适的工人住宅、最新式样的汽车、富丽堂皇的地下电车站的模型等等，而且是那些最具有说服力的统计数字：苏联人民1956年比1932年消费了多两倍的肉类、九倍的牛奶、二十二倍的丝织品、八倍的毛织品、十倍的针织品，在1956年一年之内，苏联人民从国家那里得到了一百一十万套新住宅……
    苏联人民不仅物质生活水平逐年提高，而且他们日益增长的文化需求也得到不断的满足。在关于文学、艺术、教育、体育、医药卫生等事业的展览部分，人们可以看到在这个社会主义国家中，每一个苏维埃人怎样被培养成为一个有教养的社会主义公民，文学艺术怎样沿着社会主义现实主义的道路而欣欣向荣，人民的健康怎样受到国家无微不至的照顾，儿童怎样受到爱护，妇女怎样得到真正的解放……所有这一切，对于一些生活在失业和贫穷的威胁下的资本主义国家人民来说，是多么值得羡慕的呵！
    有一位来自阿根廷的参观者曾这样写下他的观感：“看了苏联展览馆以后，我深深相信社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越得多。”这种看法显然不只是这一位参观者的观感。不过当他们参观了美国展览馆之后，他们的这种信念就一定会更加加强。
    美国展览馆如其说是像一个国家的展览馆，倒不如说像一个有怪癖的收藏家的陈列室和一家规模不大的百货商店。里面的展览品是多么空虚而平庸呵！一进门，人们看到的都是一些莫名其妙的东西：美国各个地方的汽车牌照啦、各种酒类的商标啦，再不然就是许多饭馆的菜单啦……这些展览品可能是要表明美国是全世界酗酒最厉害和车祸最多的国家吧，那末那个用朽木雕成的死神的雕像，或者放在一个玻璃橱中的三颗干瘪了的玉米，还有几付奇形怪装的眼镜等等又说明什么呢？真是使人摸不着头脑。然后参观者就会被引导进一个画廊了，在那里面四壁挂满了一些现代派的油画，这边是一堆颜色，那边是一束纵横交错的线条，如果不看作者的名字，人们一定会以为都是曾经名震美国艺坛的猩猩画家“别西卡”的杰作。这就是美国今天的艺术！当一个参观者以为还是在画廊里巡礼的时候，他其实已经进入了美国地球物理年的展览室了。那里面既没有“先锋号”火箭的残骸，也没有“探险者”人造卫星的模型，只有一些和现代派作品一样离奇古怪的墙饰，有人从播音器中用做商业广告似的口吻在宣传美国在地球物理年的成就，观众寥寥可数。
    当然在美国展览馆中也并不是没有一点正经的东西，例如，人们也可以看到一个原子发电站的模型、一艘还没有建成的原子动力船的模型、一些电子计算机和应用同位素的科学仪器等，但是所有这些东西加在一起，也只能说明，美国的科学技术水平已远远落在苏联的后面。
    至于在展览馆的二层楼上，那就显得更加贫乏和庸俗了。这层楼的展览品分成两部分。一部分是布置成一条典型的美国街道，里面有一家出售妇女时装的商店、一家卖安眠药和阿斯匹灵等药物的药房。一家卖可口可乐一类饮料的咖啡店、一个卖侦探小说和黄色杂志的书摊……既然美国典型的街道是这个样子的，那么人们就不难想像出典型的美国生活方式是怎么样的了。在二层楼上的另外一部分，则杂乱无章地陈列着一些电气冰箱、塑胶器皿、儿童玩具等日用品，货色还没有布鲁塞尔一家二流的百货商店齐全哩。
    然而所有这些就是一个参观者在美国展览馆中所能看到的了。一些对美国崇拜的人恐怕是会感到失望的。但是其实一点也不奇怪。美国展览馆正是如实地反映了美国经济萧条、文化教育衰退、科学技术落后的现状。
    从这两个“橱窗”，人们可以看出两个世界所走着的两条不同的道路以及不同的前景。社会主义国家正在蒸蒸日上地向前迈进，资本主义国家正在日益衰落。任何力量也改变不了这种现实和趋势。（附图片）
