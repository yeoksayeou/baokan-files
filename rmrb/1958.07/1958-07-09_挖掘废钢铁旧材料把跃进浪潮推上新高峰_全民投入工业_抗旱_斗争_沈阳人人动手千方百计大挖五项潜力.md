Shenyang, July 8th (reporter Lu Munong) - Shenyang has begun a massive, widespread, and in-depth "five digging" movement led by the secretary, with everyone participating, to tap the potential of materials, equipment, funds, labor, and housing in every possible way. The city will dig out 5,000 sets of machinery and equipment, 50,000 tons of steel, 150,000 square meters of housing, 50 million yuan of funds, and 20,000 laborers in the shortest possible time to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production.

The movement has just begun, and it has already proved that Shenyang has a very strong material potential.

According to a preliminary survey by the Municipal Statistics Bureau and other units in 63 state-owned enterprises and capital construction units, these units have 2,732 sets of idle metal cutting and other equipment. The warehouses of many large enterprises and the Shenyang offices of various industrial ministries of the central government also have tens of thousands of tons of steel materials in storage. According to the statistics of the Shenyang offices of the Ministry of Coal Industry and Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant and other eight units, which launched the "five digging" movement the earliest, they have dug out more than 5,000 tons of steel, more than 320 sets of machinery and equipment, 10,000 sets of ball bearings and more than 10,000 meters of cables that have been idle for a long time. Even the agencies and banks that were once considered to have no steel or machinery and equipment have dug out a lot of materials and equipment after thoroughly cleaning the warehouses this time.

It was originally thought that the potential of housing and labor was difficult to tap, but after mobilizing the masses, more than 100,000 square meters of vacant housing were quickly discovered. The city plans to dig out 20,000 laborers. Now it seems that there is confidence to realize this plan. According to a survey of 32 factories, due to the development of technological innovation, a large number of inventions and improvements in operating methods, and the rational adjustment of labor organization, production efficiency is improving at an alarming rate. The number of factories with insufficient labor is gradually decreasing. Among these factories, only four are short of 219,000 work hours for lathe, milling, and planing, etc., in the second half of the year. The remaining factories have a total surplus of 1,300,800 work hours in these types of work, most of which can be used to supplement factories lacking work hours. Many units are working hard to tap the potential of funds. At present, more than 30 factories, including Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, have found many ways to raise funds themselves, creating a new way to expand and renovate factories without state investment. Among them, the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant reduced the original planned investment of 72 million yuan for expanding the factory to 20 million yuan, and increased the original designed annual output of 6,000 machine tools to 10,000. The 20 million yuan of investment can be solved by tapping the internal potential of the enterprise.

In all factories throughout the city, efforts are also being made to accelerate the turnover of enterprise working capital and save the use of working capital. They will accelerate the turnover of enterprise working capital by 10%, saving 170 million yuan of funds, which will be used for production and construction. Many agencies, schools, and factories have also begun to tap the potential of funds outside the budget. (Attached picture)

### 挖掘废钢铁旧材料把跃进浪潮推上新高峰  全民投入工业“抗旱”斗争  沈阳人人动手千方百计大挖五项潜力

    挖掘废钢铁旧材料把跃进浪潮推上新高峰
    全民投入工业“抗旱”斗争
    沈阳人人动手千方百计大挖五项潜力
    本报沈阳8日电  记者鲁牧农报道：沈阳开始了一个声势浩大、广泛深入的由书记负责，人人动手，千方百计地挖掘材料、设备、资金、劳动力和房屋潜力的全民性“五挖”运动。全市在最短期内从各个角落挖出五千台机器设备，五万吨钢铁，十五万平方公尺房屋，五千万元资金和两万名劳动力，以适应生产大跃进的需要。
    这个运动刚开始，便证实沈阳市的物资潜力很雄厚。
    这次据市统计局等单位在六十三个国营企业和基本建设单位初步调查，这些单位所闲置的金属切削等设备就有二千七百三十二台；许多大企业和中央各工业部驻沈阳办事处的仓库，也都存有成千成万吨钢铁材料。仅据开展“五挖”运动最早的煤炭工业部驻沈阳办事处和沈阳第三机床厂等八个单位的统计，一次就挖出长期闲置的钢材五千多吨，三百二十多台机器设备，一万套滚珠和一万多公尺电缆。一贯被认为不会有钢铁、机器设备的机关和银行，这次经彻底打扫仓库，也挖出不少材料和设备。
    原来认为房屋和劳动力的潜力不好挖掘，当发动群众以后，很快发掘出十万多平方公尺空闲房屋。全市计划挖掘二万名劳动力。现在看来，已经有把握实现这个计划。据三十二个工厂的调查，由于开展技术革新，出现大量的创造发明和改进操作方法，以及合理调整劳动组织，生产效率都在惊人的提高中。劳动力不足的工厂在逐渐减少着，在这些工厂中只有四家下半年缺车、铣、刨等工种二十一万九千工时，其余工厂在这些工种中共多余一百三十万零八千个工时，大多可以拿出补充缺乏工时的工厂。很多单位挖资金潜力的劲头很大，目前，已有沈阳风动工具厂等三十多个工厂找出许多种自筹资金的方法，创造了不用国家投资，也能扩建和改建工厂的新途径。其中沈阳第二机床厂由原计划扩建工厂的投资七千二百万元减少到二千万元，并且由原设计年产六千台机床增加到一万台，两千万元的投资，都可由挖掘企业内部潜力来解决。
    在全市的各个工厂里，还都在努力加速企业流动资金的周转和节省流动资金的使用，都要把企业流动资金周转加速10％，从中节省出一亿七千万元资金，用于生产建设。很多机关、学校和工厂还开始挖掘预算以外资金的潜力。（附图片）
