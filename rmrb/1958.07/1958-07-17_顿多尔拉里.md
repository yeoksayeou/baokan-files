"Tondollari" is a popular mass dance among the working people of Korea today. It is no accident that the heroic Korean people love this dance.

Two or thirty years ago, during the high tide of the Korean people's resistance against Japan, women in the Sinchang area of ​​Hamgyongnam-do created the "Tondollari" dance to express their resistance to Japanese imperialism and the oppression of the feudal system. At that time, every year around the "March 8th" Women's Day, they would go to the sandy mountains to "enjoy the flowers" under the guise of digging wild garlic, carrying baskets and singing "Tondollari." "Enjoying the flowers" was their secret gathering to resist Japanese imperialism. They danced and sang on the white sand and grass in the pine forest:

　　Tondollari, Rirari, Rariyo,
　　We have beautiful rivers and mountains in front of our village,
　　We are holding a red conference in a small thatched cottage!
　　Tondollari, Rirari, Rariyo,
　　Treasure-filled green mountains, Tondollari yo!
　　Dawn will surely come, we are holding a red conference in a small thatched cottage!
　　We must drive the Japanese devils out of our rich and beautiful land!
　　Bright days will surely come!

The suppression by Japanese imperialism became increasingly fierce, but the women's gatherings on the sandy mountains under the guise of enjoying flowers never stopped.

After liberation, the farmers in the hometown of "Tondollari" have lived in the warm big family of agricultural cooperatives. Every day after happily working, at sunset, they often gather together to sing about new life and dance to their heart's content. The girls in the amateur dance group in the cooperative have reached the level of skilled dancers, and their performance of "Tondollari" won the first prize at the National Art Festival.

    顿多尔拉里
    “顿多尔拉里”是今天朝鲜劳动人民中间流行最广的一种群众性舞蹈。英雄的朝鲜人民之所以喜欢这个舞蹈，并不是偶然的。
    二三十年前，当朝鲜人民抗日高潮时期，咸镜南道新昌地区的妇女们创造了“顿多尔拉里”舞，来表示对日本帝国主义和封建制度压迫的反抗。那时，每年在“三八”妇女节前后，她们便以挖野蒜为名，提着筐唱着“顿多尔拉里”到沙山上去“赏花”。“赏花”就是她们反抗日本帝国主义的秘密集会。她们在松林里的白沙地和草地上边跳边唱：
    顿多尔拉里，里拉里，拉里哟，
    我们村前有美丽的江山，
    我们在小草屋里开红色大会啊！
    顿多尔拉里，里拉里，拉里哟，
    宝藏青山，顿多尔拉里哟！
    黎明必将到来，我们在小草屋里开红色大会啊！
    我们一定要把日本鬼子赶出我们富饶美丽的疆土！
    光明的日子必将来临！
    日本帝国主义的镇压越来越凶，但是此地妇女们以赏花为名的沙山上的大会，却从来没有中断过。
    解放后，“顿多尔拉里”故乡的农民们已生活在农业社的温暖大家庭里。他们每当日落黄昏愉快地劳动一天以后，经常聚集在一起歌唱新生活和尽情地跳舞。社里业余舞蹈小组的姑娘们的舞蹈已达到了熟练舞蹈家的水平，她们表演的“顿多尔拉里”曾在全国艺术观摩大会上荣获头等奖。（附图片）
