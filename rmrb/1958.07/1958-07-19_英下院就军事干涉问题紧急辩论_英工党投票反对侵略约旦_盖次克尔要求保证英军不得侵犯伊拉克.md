Xinhua News Agency, London, July 18th: The British House of Commons held an emergency debate last night on the issue of British military intervention in the Middle East situation. This debate was held at the request of the Labour Party. That afternoon, Prime Minister Macmillan had announced to the House of Commons that Britain had sent troops to Jordan. This caused anxiety among opposition party members, who firmly demanded a debate on the issue of military intervention.

Macmillan spoke first. He admitted that Britain's military actions were aimed at the nationalist "revolutionary movement" of the Middle Eastern people. He said that he believed that he could not "sit idly by" and "let this revolutionary movement happen one after another in Jordan and Iraq, and perhaps elsewhere."

Macmillan revealed that before British troops landed, the United States had sent an air force detachment to scout over Jordan for the British army. Currently, Foreign Secretary Lloyd is discussing with the Washington authorities what actions the United States will take in Jordan. He also revealed that Britain's dispatch of troops to Jordan had been approved by Turkey, Pakistan, Iran and other members of the Baghdad Pact.

Labour Party foreign affairs spokesman Bevan warned: "The government may have taken a big step in throwing this country into war."

He said that the Labour Party could not agree with Britain carrying out unnecessary interventions in many parts of the world. He also pointed out: "If King Hussein's request to send troops into Jordan is justified, then the Iraqi (Republic) government in Baghdad is also fully entitled to ask Russia for help."

Labour leader Gaitskell, who had indicated that he was not prepared to "make things difficult" for the government, also opposed sending troops to Jordan in this debate. He also mentioned the Soviet government's statement, pointing out that the Soviet attitude could not be ignored.

Gaitskell was worried that the Jordanian army, standing with Western troops, might clash with the Iraqi army, and demanded that the government try to negotiate with the Soviet Union on the Middle East situation, especially to hold "some kind of summit meeting." It was reported that Gaitskell had met with Macmillan that day, demanding that he guarantee: 1. British troops will not enter Iraq; 2. Once Jordanian troops cross the Iraqi border, British troops will immediately withdraw from Jordan. However, Macmillan refused to provide this guarantee. The Labour Party leadership then decided to demand a vote.

As a result of the vote, 314 votes supported the government's military intervention, and 251 votes opposed it. The six Liberal Party members voted against it along with the Labour Party members.

    英下院就军事干涉问题紧急辩论
    英工党投票反对侵略约旦
    盖次克尔要求保证英军不得侵犯伊拉克
    据新华社18日电　伦敦消息：英国下院昨天晚上就英国军事干涉中东局势的问题举行紧急辩论。这次辩论是应工党的要求而举行的。当天下午，首相麦克米伦曾经向下院宣布：英国已经出兵约旦。这引起了反对党议员的焦虑不安，他们坚决要求就军事干涉问题举行辩论。
    麦克米伦首先发言。他承认，英国的军事行动是针对着中东人民的民族主义“革命运动”的。他说，他认为不能“袖手旁观”，“让这种革命运动一个接着一个地发生在约旦和伊拉克，或许还在其他地方”。
    麦克米伦透露，在英国部队着陆前，美国曾经派一个空军小队在约旦上空为英军侦察。目前，外交大臣劳埃德正在同华盛顿当局讨论美国在约旦将采取什么行动的问题。他还透露，英国出兵约旦曾经得到土耳其、巴基斯坦和伊朗等巴格达条约成员国的同意。
    工党外交事务发言人比万警告说：“政府在把这个国家投入战争方面，可能已经走了一大步。”
    他说，工党不能同意英国在世界上的许多地区进行不必要的干涉。他并且指出：“如果（约旦）侯赛因国王希望派兵进入约旦的要求是正当的，那么，巴格达的伊拉克（共和国）政府也完全有权要求俄国给予帮助。”
    曾经表示不准备同政府“为难”的工党领袖盖次克尔在这次辩论中也反对出兵约旦。他还提到苏联政府的声明，指出不能忽视苏联的态度。
    盖次克尔担心同西方的军队站在一起的约旦军队可能同伊拉克军队冲突，要求政府设法同苏联就中东局势进行谈判，特别要求举行
  “某种最高级会议”。有消息说，盖次克尔当天曾经同麦克米伦会谈，要求他保证：一、英国军队不进入伊拉克；二、一旦约旦军队越过伊拉克边境，英国军队就立即撤出约旦。但是麦克米伦不肯提供这种保证。工党领导机构于是决定要求举行投票。
    投票结果，支持政府军事干涉的有三百一十四票，反对的有二百五十一票。自由党的六个议员同工党议员一起投反对票。
