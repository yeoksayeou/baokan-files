Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 18th. The Ministry of Agriculture recently convened a wheat production conference in Zhengzhou with ten provinces and cities. Based on a careful summary of the 1958 wheat yield increase experience, the conference researched and deployed preparatory work for striving for an even greater bumper harvest in the summer of 1959.

The ten provinces and cities are Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Gansu, and Beijing. According to reports, this year's summer harvest crops in these ten provinces and cities have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. Among them, wheat covers more than 300 million mu, with a total output of 59.9 billion jin, an increase of over 73% compared to last year. Many high-yield "red flags" and "satellites" have emerged in various places. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 740,000 mu of wheat fields with yields of 1,000 to 2,000 jin per mu, 4,236 mu with 2,000 to 3,000 jin, 264.47 mu with 3,000 to 4,000 jin, and 34 mu with 4,000 to 5,000 jin. In Gucheng County, Hubei Province, 8.7 mu of wheat fields yielded more than 5,000 jin per mu. In Heping and Mengjin agricultural cooperatives in Xiping County, Henan Province, 3.7 mu of wheat fields achieved yields of over 7,000 jin per mu. The Heping agricultural cooperative created a wheat yield of 7,320 jin per mu. The barley yield in Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, was 5,702 jin per mu, which is the highest national record for these two crops to date. Hubei, Henan, and Hebei provinces have also produced twelve wheat "Marshal" counties (cities) with an average wheat yield of over 500 jin per mu. In addition, 24 counties with yields of over 400 jin per mu have emerged in Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, and Hebei provinces. The average yield per mu in Xiangyang in Hubei Province, Tangshan in Hebei Province, and Xuchang, Shangqiu, and Nanyang in Henan Province has reached over 300 jin.

The reports from various places also indicate that this year's summer grain bumper harvest in these ten provinces and cities was achieved under frequent natural disasters. Before sowing last year, these ten provinces and cities suffered from severe drought. Most areas did not experience thorough rainfall from sowing to harvest. In the spring, they were continuously attacked by frost, wind, hail, and various pests and diseases. During sowing, due to the concentration of efforts on drought resistance in various places, some measures such as deep plowing, improved seeds, and close planting were implemented relatively well, but the preparation work in most areas was poor, and sowing was relatively rough. However, in the field management work, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, leaders at all levels and the broad masses continuously overcame right-leaning conservative thinking, put forward the heroic slogan of "competing with the sky for grain, with strength higher than the sky," and fully mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, waged a tenacious struggle against the constantly attacking various natural disasters, and conscientiously strengthened the later stage field management, thus powerfully guaranteeing the summer bumper harvest.

The conference believes that this year's unprecedented summer grain harvest not only clearly illustrates that wheat is not only not a low-yielding crop but also has great potential for increased production, but also clearly illustrates that fully mobilizing the masses and overcoming various difficulties in agricultural production have an immeasurable and enormous role in ensuring agricultural production increases. The so-called "low-yield crop theory," the "condition theory" that land is barren and people are poor, farming is extensive, and agricultural output cannot be increased, as well as "pessimism," etc., are all extremely wrong. As long as we guard against arrogance and rashness, overcome any complacency and numbness, and fully prepare for the sowing of next year's summer harvest grain crops, striving for an even greater summer grain bumper harvest next year is fully within our grasp.

After carefully analyzing the enormous potential for increasing wheat production, the conference proposed that vigorously expanding the sowing area of summer grain crops and increasing the proportion of summer harvest crops is a strategic measure to ensure greater agricultural production increases next year. At the meeting, each province and city put forward preliminary plans for the sowing area of summer harvest crops next year.

The conference believes that starting from now, making all preparations for next year's summer harvest crop production in advance and ensuring timely sowing of wheat, planting sufficiently and well, is the first hurdle in striving for a greater bumper harvest of summer grain crops next year. All localities must attach great importance to this. From now on, specific personnel must be designated to be responsible, strengthen leadership, and step up preparations in all aspects. Currently, all localities must universally combine the summary of the summer bumper harvest, conduct extensive exhibitions and evaluations, exchange advanced experiences in large-area high-yield wheat production, and universally launch a great debate on striving for another leap forward in wheat production next year, thoroughly liberate thinking, and specifically formulate leap forward plans for wheat production next year. While strengthening field management of autumn crops to strive for a full-year bumper harvest, we must universally launch a mass upsurge in preparatory work for autumn sowing, conscientiously select and retain sufficient improved seeds, ensure that all wheat fields will be planted with improved seeds next year, and universally increase the sowing amount to meet the requirements of close planting; combined with deep plowing and leveling the land, do a good job in wheat field drainage and irrigation projects, so that it can both prevent drought and prevent flooding, and ensure normal wheat growth; extensively carry out summer fertilizer accumulation to ensure that wheat fields have sufficient fertilizer; universally deep plow the land before sowing, and apply basal fertilizer in layers; comprehensively reform wheat production tools to adapt to the requirements of deep plowing and close planting and improve labor efficiency; adopt "native and foreign combined" methods to prepare sufficient pesticides, and strive to ensure that all wheat fields prevent underground pests from overwintering and prevent seed-borne diseases from entering the soil.

In order to ensure an even greater bumper harvest next summer, the conference emphasized that all localities should fully utilize the successful leadership experience of "grasping both ends and bringing along the middle" in this summer's harvest, and from now on, firmly grasp the leadership of the sowing preparation work for high-yield wheat fields. The conference also put forward requirements for the proportion of high-yield fields next year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 18th, eight counties and cities in Henan Province have emerged with average yields exceeding 500 jin per mu in the wheat bumper harvest. These eight counties and cities are: Meng County, Bo'ai, Yanshi, Xiping, Lushan, Xiangcheng, Xiayi, and Shangqiu City, among which Meng County and Bo'ai County have the highest yields. Meng County's more than 258,000 mu of wheat achieved an average yield of 603 jin per mu. Bo'ai County's more than 273,900 mu of wheat achieved an average yield of 585 jin per mu, an increase of more than two times compared to last year. The wheat harvest area of the remaining five counties ranges from over 320,000 mu to over 970,000 mu. The average yield per mu in the whole county is: Yanshi 571 jin, Xiayi 518 jin, Xiping 544 jin, Xiangcheng 520 jin, Lushan 526 jin. Shangqiu City's more than 18,600 mu of wheat yielded 550 jin per mu.

The miracle of large-area bumper harvests of wheat in these eight counties and cities powerfully refuted the skepticism of those "condition theorists" and "favorable weather theorists," and set an example for the people of Henan Province to strive for a greater wheat harvest next year. Except for the three counties of Meng County and Bo'ai north of the Yellow River and Yanshi south of the Yellow River, where the land is relatively fertile and wheat yields are relatively high, the remaining four counties and Shangqiu City are all barren mountainous areas, hilly areas, and areas that have suffered from water and drought disasters for many years. Xiayi is still one of the famous low-yielding counties in Henan Province. In 1949, the yield per mu was only 68 jin, and last year the wheat yield per mu in the whole county was only 103 jin.

    十个省市丰产经验证明
    小麦增产潜力很大
    河南八个县市小麦亩产量超过五百斤
    新华社郑州18日电　农业部最近在郑州召开的十省、市小麦生产会议，在认真总结1958年小麦增产经验的基础上，研究和部署了争取1959年夏季更大丰收的准备工作。
    这十个省市是河北、山东、山西、河南、陕西、江苏、安徽、湖北、甘肃等省和北京市。根据汇报，今年这十个省市的夏收作物都空前大丰收。其中小麦三亿多亩，总产量五百九十九亿斤，比去年增长73％强。各地都涌现出了许多高额丰产的“红旗”和“卫星”。据不完全统计，亩产一千斤到二千斤的麦田共有七十四万多亩，二千斤到三千斤的有四千二百三十六亩，三千斤到四千斤的有二百六十四点四七亩，四千斤到五千斤的有三十四亩。湖北省谷城县有八点七亩麦田亩产五千斤以上。河南省西平县和平、猛进两个农业社有三点七亩麦田亩产达到七千斤以上。和平农业社创造的小麦亩产七千三百二十斤。山西省介休县的大麦亩产五千七百零二斤，是截至目前为止的这两项作物的全国最高纪录。湖北、河南、河北三省并且出现了十二个小麦平均亩产五百斤以上的小麦“元帅”县（市）。另外，在甘肃、陕西、河南、湖北、河北等省还出现了二十四个亩产四百斤以上的县；湖北省的襄阳、河北省的唐山和河南省的许昌、商丘、南阳等五个专区的平均亩产量达到三百斤以上。
    各地汇报的情况还表明：今年，这十个省、市的夏粮丰收是在自然灾害频繁的情况下获得的。去年播种前，这十个省、市都遭到了严重干旱，大部地区在播种后到收获前都没有下过透雨，春季又连续遭到霜冻、风、雹和各种病虫害的袭击。播种时由于各地集中力量抗旱，除部分地区深耕、良种和密植等项措施贯彻较好外，大部分地区准备工作较差，播种比较粗糙。但是在麦田管理工作中，由于总路线光辉照耀，各级领导和广大群众不断克服右倾保守思想，提出“与天争粮，劲比天高”的英雄口号，充分发挥广大群众的积极性和创造性，同不断袭来的各种自然灾害展开顽强斗争，认真地加强了后期田间管理，因而有力地保证了夏季的大丰收。
    会议认为，今年夏季粮食作物的空前大丰收，不只清楚地说明了小麦不仅不是低产作物，而且具有很大的增产潜力，同时也清楚地说明了充分发动群众，战胜农业生产上的种种困难，对于保证农业增产有着不可估量的巨大作用。过去那些所谓“低产作物论”，地瘠民贫、耕作粗放、农业产量不能提高的“唯条件论”，以及“悲观论”等，都是十分错误的。只要我们戒骄戒躁，克服任何自满麻痹情绪，充分做好明年夏收粮食作物的播种准备工作，力争明年出现一个更大的夏粮大丰收，是具有充分把握的。
    会议在认真分析了小麦增产的巨大潜力之后提出：大力扩大夏季粮食作物播种面积，提高夏收作物的比重，是保证明年农业获得更大增产的一项具有战略性的措施。会上，各省、市都提出了明年夏收作物播种面积的初步规划。
    会议认为，从现在起，提前为明年夏收作物生产做好一切准备，保证小麦播种适时，种足种好，是争取明年夏粮作物获得更大丰收的第一关。各地必须引起高度重视。从现在起就要确定专人负责，加强领导，从各方面加紧进行准备。当前各地要普遍结合总结夏季大丰收，广泛进行展览评比，交流小麦大面积高额丰产的先进经验等活动，并且要普遍展开争取明年小麦生产再跃进的大辩论，彻底解放思想，具体制定明年小麦生产的跃进规划。在加强秋季作物田间管理力争全年大丰收的同时，要普遍掀起一个群众性的秋种准备工作高潮，认真选留足够的良种，保证明年麦田全部实现良种化，并且普遍加大播种量，实现密植要求；结合深翻地和平整土地，做好麦田排灌工程，做到既能防旱，又能防涝，保证小麦正常生长；广泛开展夏季积肥，保证麦田有充足的肥料；播种前普遍深翻土地，分层施底肥；全面改革小麦生产工具，以适应深耕密植要求，提高劳动效率；采用“土洋结合”方法，准备足够的农药，力争全部麦田作到不让地下虫害越冬，不使种子病害入土。
    为了确保明年夏季更大丰收，会议强调提出：各地要充分运用今年夏季丰收中“抓两头，带中间”的成功的领导经验，从现在起就要抓紧领导高额丰产麦田的播种准备工作。会议并且对明年高额丰产田的比重提出了要求。
    据新华社郑州18日电　河南省在小麦大丰收中，出现了八个平均亩产量超过五百斤的县市。这八个县市是：孟县、博爱、偃师、西平、鲁山、襄城、夏邑和商丘市，其中孟县、博爱两县产量最高。孟县二十五万八千多亩小麦，平均亩产达到六百零三斤。博爱县二十七万三千九百多亩小麦，平均亩产达到五百八十五斤，比去年增产两倍多。其余五县的小麦收获面积从三十二万多亩到九十七万多亩不等，全县平均亩产量是：偃师五百七十一斤，夏邑五百一十八斤，西平五百四十四斤，襄城五百二十斤，鲁山五百二十六斤。商丘市一万八千六百多亩小麦，亩产五百五十斤。
    这八个县、市出现小麦大面积丰收的奇迹，有力地驳斥了那些“条件论”者和“风调雨顺论”者的怀疑论调，给河南省人民争取明年小麦更大丰收树立了榜样。这八个县、市除黄河以北的孟县、博爱和黄河南岸的偃师等三县土地比较肥沃，小麦产量较高外，其余四县和商丘市，都是贫瘠的山区、丘陵区和连年遭受水旱灾害的地区。夏邑还是河南省有名的低产县之一，1949年亩产量只有六十八斤，去年全县小麦亩产量也只有一百零三斤。
