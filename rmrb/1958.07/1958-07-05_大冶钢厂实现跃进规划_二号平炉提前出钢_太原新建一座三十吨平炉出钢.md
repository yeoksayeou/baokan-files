    Daye Steel Plant Achieves Leap Forward Plan
    No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Taps Steel Ahead of Schedule
    New 30-Ton Open Hearth Furnace Taps Steel in Taiyuan
    According to Xinhua News Agency, another newly built large open hearth furnace—No. 2 open hearth furnace—at Daye Steel Plant officially tapped steel on "July 1st," a month ahead of schedule. The workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Daye Branch, who undertook the expansion project of this plant, accelerated the construction speed in order to support the Daye Steel Plant in achieving its Leap Forward plan. This allowed No. 1 open hearth furnace to be put into production on June 1st, ahead of schedule. No. 2 open hearth furnace, which was originally scheduled to be put into production on August 1st, was also put into production a month ahead of schedule. No. 3 open hearth furnace will also be put into production half a month ahead of schedule.
    The 30-ton open hearth furnace in the newly built steel casting workshop of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant has been put into production on "July 1st." As early as the end of March this year, Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant built a 3-ton electric furnace, changing the situation in the plant where steel could not be smelted and casted in the past. After the 30-ton open hearth furnace is put into production, it can produce 31,900 tons of steel per year, and can be used together with another 30-ton open hearth furnace that is about to be put into production to cast large steel castings and steel ingots of 50 to 60 tons. In the second half of this year, Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant will produce heavy equipment such as rolling mills, hydraulic presses, and high-pressure gas compressors needed by nitrogen fertilizer plants for fraternal factories and mines in various places. The 30-ton open hearth furnace was built to ensure the completion of the above tasks.

    大冶钢厂实现跃进规划
    二号平炉提前出钢
    太原新建一座三十吨平炉出钢
    据新华社讯　大冶钢厂又一座新建的大平炉——二号平炉，提前一个月在“七一”正式出钢。承担这个厂的扩建工程的武钢大冶分公司的职工，为了支援大冶钢厂实现跃进规划，加快了建设速度，使一号平炉在6月1日提前投入了生产，原计划要在8月1日投入生产的二号平炉，也提前一个月投入生产，三号平炉也将提前半个月投入生产。
    太原重型机器厂新建铸钢车间的三十吨平炉已在“七一”投入生产。太原重型机器厂早在今年3月底就建成了一座三吨电炉，改变了厂内过去不能炼钢浇铸的局面。三十吨平炉投入生产以后，一年能出钢三万一千九百吨，可以跟即将投入生产的另一座三十吨平炉共同浇铸五十吨到六十吨的大型铸钢件和钢锭。太原重型机器厂今年下半年将为各地兄弟厂矿生产轧钢机、水压机和氮肥厂需要的高压压气机等重型设备，三十吨平炉就是为保证完成以上的任务而兴建的。
