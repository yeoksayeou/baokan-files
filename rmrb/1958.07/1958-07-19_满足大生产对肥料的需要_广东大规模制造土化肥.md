To Meet the Needs of Large-Scale Production for Fertilizer
Guangdong Massively Manufactures Indigenous Fertilizer

(Reported by this newspaper) A mass movement to manufacture indigenous fertilizer on a large scale has emerged in Guangdong. According to statistics from the Hepu Special District, by the end of June, more than 2,500 indigenous fertilizer plants had been built. The indigenous fertilizer produced and being produced can provide 20 jin of fertilizer per mu for 3.5 million mu of intermediate and late rice in the district. This is a nine-fold increase compared to the previous application of 2 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu. In Xuwen County, Zhanjiang Special District, 1,500 production teams recently built more than 1,700 indigenous fertilizer plants in just two or three days.

The types of indigenous fertilizers manufactured by the masses in Guangdong are diverse and rich. According to statistics, there are over a thousand types of indigenous fertilizers manufactured throughout the province. Among the 565 types of indigenous fertilizers that have been tested and identified by higher-level authorities and technical departments, 176 types, including various indigenous ammonia fertilizers, potash fertilizers, potassium silicate fertilizers, bittern fertilizers, and nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium mixed fertilizers, have been proven to be suitable for promotion. Some of these varieties are of very good quality. For example, the potassium chloride made by the masses in Taishan County using indigenous methods contains 47% to 51% potassium oxide. The work of manufacturing indigenous fertilizer in these areas of Guangdong Province began by relying on the masses, starting with indigenous methods, focusing on small-scale operations, and using locally available materials.

Currently, an early rice harvest in Guangdong is already assured, and a more magnificent upsurge in late rice production is imminent. Many places have put forward the slogan of dense planting, even denser planting, requiring the number of rice seedlings transplanted per mu to increase from 10,000 to 20,000 in the early rice season to 40,000 to 70,000. In early July, the leading organs of Guangdong Province decided that in the second half of this year, the province will produce 1 million tons of indigenous fertilizer, 750,000 tons of phosphate rock powder, and 15 million tons of seaweed fertilizer. It is required that at least half of the above tasks be completed before the end of September. At the same time, it is required that the fertilizer efficiency of indigenous fertilizer be at least 25% or more of that of chemical fertilizer.

In order to complete the above task of producing indigenous fertilizer, Guangdong Province convened a conference on indigenous fertilizer in early July, requiring the province to vigorously develop indigenous fertilizer. The methods are: (1) Further eliminate superstitious ideas and continue to struggle against right-leaning conservative thoughts such as "technological determinism," "regional conditions determinism," and "difficulty determinism." (2) Under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, all departments should closely cooperate to establish and improve specialized institutions for fertilizer production. (3) Strengthen technical guidance. Special districts should establish indigenous fertilizer research institutes, and counties should also establish relatively large-scale laboratories. (4) Actively seek sources of fertilizer, understand resource conditions, especially mineral resources, for long-term planning. (5) Reform fertilizer production tools to accelerate fertilizer production. (6) Strengthen supervision and inspection, conduct regular evaluations, and promote the mass movement of indigenous fertilizer production in various places.

    满足大生产对肥料的需要
    广东大规模制造土化肥
    本报讯　广东地区出现大规模制造土化肥的群众性运动。据合浦专区的统计，到6月底止即建成二千五百多座土化肥厂，已生产和正在生产的土化肥，可供该区三百五十万亩中稻、晚稻每亩下肥二十斤之用。比往年每亩施化肥二斤增加九倍。湛江专区徐闻县一千五百个生产队，最近仅仅用两三天时间，即建成土化肥厂一千七百多个。
    广东省各地群众制造的土化肥多种多样，丰富多采。据统计全省各地制造的土化肥上千种之多，经过上级和技术部门化验、鉴定的五百六十五种土化肥中，证明能够推广的有各种土制氨肥、钾肥、硅酸钾肥、苦卤肥、氮磷钾混合肥等共一百七十六种。其中有些品种的质量很好，例如台山县群众用土法制成的氯化钾，其中含的氧化钾达到47％　51％。广东省这些地方制造土化肥的工作，一开始就依据依靠群众、土办法先上马、以小型为主、就地取材的方针办事。
    现在，广东省早造丰收已成定局，正面临一次波涛更加壮阔的晚造生产高潮。许多地方提出密植、再密植的口号，要求每亩插秧从早造一两万科，增加到四万至七万科。广东省领导机关7月初决定：今年下半年全省生产土化肥一百万吨，磷矿石粉七十五万吨，海肥一千五百万吨。要求9月底以前至少完成上述任务的一半，同时，要求土化肥的肥效至少要等于洋化肥的25％以上。
    为完成上述生产土化肥的任务，广东省7月初召开了土化肥会议，要求全省大办土化肥，办法是：（1）进一步破除迷信思想，继续针对“唯技术论”、“地区条件论”、“困难论”等等右倾保守思想进行斗争。（2）在各级党委统一领导下，各部门密切配合，建立和健全生产肥料的专业机构。（3）加强技术指导，专区要建立土化肥研究所，县也要建立略具规模的化验室。（4）积极找寻肥源，摸清资源情况，特别是矿质资源，以作长期打算。（5）进行制肥工具的改革，加速肥料生产。（6）加强督促检查，定期评比，推动各地群众性生产土化肥的运动。
