    High-Yield List of Early Rice Exceeding 4,000 Jin Per Mu
    Chunguang Cooperative

    This newspaper reports that the 28th production team of the Chunguang Agricultural Cooperative in Baihu Township, Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, harvested a total of 11,152 jin of net grain from a 1.7 mu experimental early rice field. The harvest concluded on the afternoon of July 24, 1958, averaging 6,487 jin per mu.

    The high-yield field experiment was conducted by Deng Bizhen, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Yingcheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the work team stationed in the cooperative. The previous crop on this early rice field was wheat. The main reasons for the high yield were the implementation of the "seedling-raising" method, deep plowing to a depth of 1.5 chi [approximately 1.5 feet], the implementation of mixed fertilization, and the widespread implementation of relatively high-density planting. At the same time, various disasters were overcome in a timely manner.

    More than 20 comrades, including Liu Renshou, leader of the High-Yield Acceptance Team of the Xiaogan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, the county committee acceptance team, and comrades from the county committee office, participated in the acceptance of this field.

        Tongxu Cooperative

    This newspaper reports that Zhang Desheng (a member of the Communist Youth League), leader of the Youth Team of the Tongxu Cooperative in Xuhe Township, Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, cultivated a 1.4 mu experimental double-cropping early rice field, which was harvested on the afternoon of July 18. Wu Xiangui, Deputy Secretary of the Township Party Committee, He Jiacai, Secretary of the Party Branch, and the cooperative accountant, along with eight other people, supervised the threshing and harvesting. The total harvest was more than 6,200 jin of rice, averaging a high-yield of 4,450 jin per mu.
      Pioneer Cooperative

    This newspaper reports that Ge Aibao, Party Branch Secretary of the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative in Yueyang, Hunan, accountant Zhu Zhengshan, and seven other team cadres planted a 1.88 mu high-yield demonstration plot in the Fifth Production Team. On July 9, the Rural Work Department of the Prefectural Committee, the County Agricultural Bureau work team, and more than ten cooperative cadres and members inspected the plot. The actual yield of dry grain was 8,015 jin, averaging 4,263 jin per mu.

      Chengxin Farm

    This newspaper reports that a 1.2 mu early rice experimental field in Chengxin Farm, Jiangxi Province, set a high-yield record of 4,425 jin per mu. The harvest took place on the 17th. The farm's Party Committee and Farm Committee jointly organized the acceptance. The 1.2 mu field yielded a total of 5,310 jin of grain, equivalent to 4,425 jin per mu. Due to the cadres' liberated thinking and bold technical experiments, they adopted "four-row complex dense planting" (3 cun [approx. 3 inches] between rows and plants) and used the excellent variety "Nante No. 1". A total of 71,880 seedlings were transplanted, equivalent to more than 65,000 seedlings per mu. Each seedling averaged 14 tillers, and each tiller averaged 106 grains of rice. The farm is now summarizing its experience and believes that complex dense planting is the most basic experience.
        Toupo Cooperative

    This newspaper reports that Yang Ziming, Secretary of the Toupo Cooperative in Shankou Township, Huaining, Anhui, cultivated a 1.1 mu experimental field in the Second Team. On the morning of the 16th, the harvest was more than 4,800 jin, averaging 4,375 jin per mu. This is an increase of eleven times over last year's yield of 418 jin per mu. The acceptance was carried out by Huang Shile, Deputy Secretary of the Township Party Committee, Yang Ziming, Secretary of the Cooperative Branch, and thirteen team leaders and thirty-five cooperative members.

        Xinluo Cooperative

    This newspaper reports that a 1.51 mu high-yield experimental field in the Xinluo Agricultural Cooperative in Xinfeng Township, Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, yielded 6,161 jin and 12 liang [1 liang = 50 grams] of net grain, averaging 4,080 jin and 10 liang of net dry grain per mu.

    This 1.51 mu high-yield early rice field was the experimental field of the Xinluo Cooperative's Party branch and Communist Youth League branch. Those who cultivated this field included Chen Ruanjiang, Secretary of the Xinluo Cooperative's Party Branch and Director of the Cooperative, and Luo Haichao, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Branch, as well as four Party members and seventeen League members. Among them, the oldest was 27 years old, the youngest was only 18 years old, and there were four women.

    早稻亩产四千斤以上的丰产榜
    春光社
    本报讯　湖北应城县白湖乡春光农业社二十八生产队有一丘一亩七分早稻试验田，于1958年7月24日下午打场结束，共收净谷一万一千一百五十二斤，平均亩产六千四百八十七斤。
    这块高额丰产田的试验人是中共应城县委书记处书记邓必祯和驻该社工作组伙办的。这块早稻田的前作物是小麦，丰产的主要原因是推行了寄秧法；深耕到一尺五寸；实行了混合施肥；普遍进行了较高度的密植。同时，也及时战胜了各种灾害。
    参加这块田验收的人，有中共孝感地委高额丰产验收组组长刘仁寿和县委验收组以及县委办公室等同志二十余人。
