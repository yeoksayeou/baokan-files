Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 20th. The Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference passed an appeal to the United Nations at its plenary session this afternoon, demanding the immediate withdrawal of US and British intervention troops from the Middle East.

The appeal stated: Faced with the threat of world war, the people of the Middle East, whose sovereignty and security are under attack and threat, and the people of the world, are appealing to the United Nations, because the responsibility of the United Nations and the basis for its existence is to maintain peace.

The appeal reminded that neither the United Nations observers nor the United Nations Secretary-General had been able to find evidence of foreign interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon. The appeal said that the governments of the United States and Britain are precisely invoking this as a reason to resort to force, and their actions undermine the authority of the United Nations. They disregard the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries. They violate the provisions of international law, attempting to impose their will on Middle Eastern countries, while international law condemns interference in the internal affairs of other countries, threats or the use of force, and armed intervention. The appeal stated that, faced with this situation, the United Nations has a responsibility to ensure that the Charter is respected.

The appeal stated that in these urgent days, the Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference held in Stockholm, with the participation of representatives from various countries, expressed the feelings that the threat of aggression and world war has aroused in the hearts of people around the world. It solemnly appeals to the United Nations. It demands the immediate withdrawal of intervention troops from the Middle East, demands the convening of the United Nations General Assembly, and demands the re-adoption of the peaceful procedures stipulated in the United Nations Charter.

    裁军和国际合作大会呼吁联合国
    迫使美英侵略军撤出中东
    新华社斯德哥尔摩20日电  裁军和国际合作大会在今天下午举行的全体会议上通过了致联合国呼吁书，要求美、英干涉军立即撤出中东。
    呼吁书说：在面临世界大战威胁的情况下，主权和安全遭到进攻和威胁的中东人民和全世界人民都向联合国发出呼吁，因为联合国的责任和它存在的基础就是维护和平。
    呼吁书提醒说，联合国观察员和联合国秘书长都没有能发现外国对黎巴嫩内政的干涉的证据。呼吁书说，美英两国政府正是在这一点上诉诸武力的，它们的这种做法破坏了联合国的权威。它们不顾各国人民的和平愿望。它们违反了国际法的规定，企图把自己的意志强加在中东国家身上，而国际法是斥责干涉其他国家内政、以武力进行威胁或使用武力和进行武装干涉的。呼吁书说，面临这种情况，联合国有责任保证宪章得到尊重。
    呼吁书说，在这些紧急的日子里，在斯德哥尔摩举行的有各国人民代表参加的裁军和国际合作大会表达了侵略和世界大战的威胁在全世界的人心中激起的感情。它郑重地向联合国发出呼吁。它要求干涉军立即撤出中东，要求召开联合国大会，并且要求重新采用联合国宪章中规定的和平程序。
