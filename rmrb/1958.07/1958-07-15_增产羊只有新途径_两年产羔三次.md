A New Way to Increase Sheep Production
Three Lambing Seasons in Two Years

According to Xinhua News Agency, the experimental herds of XinGuang and JinGuang pastoral cooperatives in Xinjiang, whose first litters were bred in early August last year, have already given birth in December and January of this year. Five hundred and one ewes in the two cooperatives gave birth to five hundred and one lambs. These lambs survived the severe winter, with four hundred and ninety-one surviving, a survival rate of 98%. The lambs are growing very strong, with an average weight twice that of lambs born two months later in the once-a-year birthing cycle. The ewes that gave birth to their first litter, after resting and fattening for two months, were bred in early March. They are currently fat and strong and will give birth to their second litter in August, and their third litter in February or March of next year. One litter every eight months, exactly three litters in two years.

The advancement of sheep lambing from once a year to three times in two years is of great significance for the development of animal husbandry production. If calculated using the same survival rate as once a year, three litters in two years can increase production by 50% each year, and the eight million ewes in the entire autonomous region can produce more than three million additional sheep each year.

    增产羊只有新途径
    两年产羔三次
    据新华社讯　新疆新光、金光等牧业社的试验畜群在去年8月初配种的第一胎已在12月和今年1月产羔。两个社五百零一只母绵羊生了五百零一只羊羔。这些羊羔度过了严寒的冬季，成活四百九十一只，成活率达到百分之九十八。羊羔生长得很健壮，比晚两个月生产的一年一胎的羊羔体重平均高一倍。生了第一胎的母羊，休息养膘两个月以后，已在3月初配种，目前膘肥体壮，8月间将生第二胎，明年2、3月将生第三胎。每八个月一胎，正好二年三胎。
    羊只产羔由一年一胎进为两年三胎，对畜牧业生产的发展有重大意义。如果以一年一胎同样的成活率计算，两年三胎后每年可增产百分之五十，全自治区八百万只母羊每年就可以多生产三百多万羊。
