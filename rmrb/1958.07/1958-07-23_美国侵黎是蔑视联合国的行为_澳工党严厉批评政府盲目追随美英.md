Perth dispatch: The Australian Labor Party and the Trades and Labor Council on the 21st condemned the American and British intervention in the Middle East.

In a joint statement, the Labor Party and the Trades and Labor Council severely criticized Australia for "blindly following the foreign policies of the United States and the United Kingdom."

Xinhua News Agency, Sydney dispatch: Australian Federal Parliament Opposition Leader Evatt accused the United States of sending troops to land in Lebanon as an act of contempt for the United Nations.

The Labor leader pointed out that United Nations observers in their report had denied the claim of outside interference in Lebanon, and that Chamoun's appeal to Eisenhower was not authorized by any parliament. He said that the U.S. sending troops to land was in no way approved by the United Nations, and that the situation was tantamount to contempt for the United Nations' report on Lebanon. Evatt said that even worse was Dulles' attempt to justify the American action under the guise of the United Nations Charter.

    澳工党严厉批评政府盲目追随美英
    本报讯  佩思消息：澳大利亚工党和工会理事会在21日谴责美国和英国干涉中东。
    工党和工会理事会在一个联合声明里严厉批评澳大利亚“盲目追随美国和联合王国的外交政策。”
    据新华社讯  悉尼消息：澳大利亚联邦议会反对党领袖伊瓦特指责美国派兵登陆黎巴嫩是蔑视联合国的行为。
    这位工党领袖指出，联合国观察员在报告中已经否定了外界干涉黎巴嫩的说法，夏蒙向艾森豪威尔发出的呼吁是没有得到任何议会的授权的。他说，美国派兵登陆丝毫没有经过联合国的认可，而且，那种情况等于蔑视联合国关于黎巴嫩的报告。伊瓦特说，更坏的是杜勒斯企图假借联合国的宪章的名义来为美国的行动辩解。
