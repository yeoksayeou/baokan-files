Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 9th (via correspondent): This correspondent reports: Today marks the full two months of the Lebanese people’s uprising against imperialism and its agents. During this period, the insurgent people’s forces have grown stronger in battle, and they have already controlled most of the country's territory. On the other hand, the pro-Western Chamoun regime is increasingly isolated, and the Lebanese public universally demands Chamoun's immediate resignation. The actions of US and British imperialists in interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs have been opposed by socialist countries and the people of the world. While continuing to prepare for armed intervention, they are intensifying political conspiracies, attempting to maintain control over Lebanon by changing the soup but not the ingredients.

On May 9th, the people of Tripoli, Lebanon's second largest city, held a general strike and market strike under the call of various opposition parties and nationalist groups to protest the assassination of nationalist leader Matni, shouting resounding slogans such as "Down with imperialism," "Down with the Eisenhower Doctrine," and "Down with Chamoun." Subsequently, the people of other cities and regions also held general strikes and market strikes, which then rapidly developed into armed uprisings. The flames of the uprising spread throughout the country.

The main areas currently controlled by the insurgents are: the Muslim residential areas such as Basta in the capital Beirut, where the leader of the insurgent forces is the leader of the National Front and former Prime Minister Salam; most of Tripoli, the main city in the north, where the leader of the insurgent forces is the leader of the Arab Liberation Party and former Prime Minister Karami; the Hermel region in the northeast and the northern Bekaa Valley, where the leader of the insurgent forces is former Speaker of Parliament Hamad; the Druze-populated Shouf Mountains in the central region, where the leader of the insurgent forces is the leader of the Socialist Progressive Party, Jumblatt; a part of Sidon, an important city in the south, where the leader of the insurgent forces is parliamentarian Saad; and an area east of the two major southern cities of Sidon and Tyre, where the leader of the insurgent forces is former Speaker of Parliament Assad. These insurgent forces do not yet have a unified command.

In politics, Chamoun, who pursues a pro-Western policy, has become increasingly isolated. Opposition to him includes the vast majority of domestic parties, all former presidents, former prime ministers, and most former ministers. Several ministers in his government have also resigned one after another. One of his supporters, parliamentarian Hus, announced that his entire family had joined the insurgent forces. Chamoun, a Christian Maronite, is trying to portray this struggle as a struggle between different religions in order to deceive all Maronite Christians into supporting him, but Maronite Archbishop Maouchi and all the bishops have also expressed their demand for his immediate resignation. Chamoun relies on police and gendarmes to suppress the insurgent forces, but many of them have also joined the insurgent forces.

However, although the leaders of the various insurgent forces opposing Chamoun are united in opposing Chamoun and demanding his immediate resignation, they differ in their attitudes towards foreign policy. Some political parties demand a change in the policy of relying on the United States, which harms national interests, while others are limited to demanding the resignation of the notorious Chamoun and his replacement by someone else as president.

The armed intervention conspiracy of US and British imperialists has suffered an initial setback under the opposition of socialist countries and the people of the world. While continuing to ship weapons to support Chamoun and continuing to actively prepare for armed intervention, they are intensifying behind-the-scenes conspiracies in an attempt to induce opposition parties to compromise on terms favorable to imperialism and reactionaries. According to Western news agencies, seeing that Chamoun has become too notorious, US and British imperialists are also prepared to agree to replace Chamoun under certain conditions in order to control Lebanon in a new way. There are reports that imperialists and the Chamoun group are plotting to convene a parliamentary meeting on July 24 to elect a new president. Arab public opinion points out that the purpose of doing so is to "elect" an agent who continues to serve the interests of imperialism. It is reported that the opposition parties have expressed their refusal to hold elections by the old parliament controlled by the Chamoun group and advocate re-electing the parliament.

At the same time, imperialists have not abandoned the attempt to use the banner of the United Nations and instigate Baghdad Pact countries to intervene in Lebanon. It has been revealed that the meeting scheduled to be held by the four Muslim member states of the Baghdad Pact in Istanbul, Turkey, on July 14 is to discuss the issue of intervention in Lebanon.

Lebanese patriots are vigilantly watching the conspiracies of US and British imperialists and their agents. They believe that as long as they do not harbor illusions about imperialism, adhere to the goal of safeguarding national independence, and insist on strengthening unity, all these conspiracies will surely be shattered.

    黎起义者越战越强  夏蒙政权日益孤立
    美英继续准备武装干涉同时加紧玩弄政治阴谋
    据新华社大马士革9日电  本社记者报道：到今天，黎巴嫩起义人民反对帝国主义和它的代理人的斗争已经进行了整整两个月。在这期间，起义人民部队越战越强，他们已经控制了全国大部分领土。另一方面，亲西方的夏蒙政权越来越孤立，黎巴嫩国内公众普遍要求夏蒙立即下台。美英帝国主义者干涉黎巴嫩内政的行动遭到社会主义国家和全世界人民的反对。他们在继续准备武装干涉的同时，正在加紧玩弄政治阴谋，企图换汤不换药地继续保持对黎巴嫩的控制。
    5月9日，黎巴嫩第二大城的黎波里人民，为抗议民族主义领袖马特尼被暗杀，在各反对党和民族主义团体号召下，举行总罢工罢市，喊出“打倒帝国主义”、“打倒艾森豪威尔主义”、“打倒夏蒙”等响亮口号。接着，其他城市和地区的人民，也举行总罢工罢市，随后并迅速发展为武装起义。起义烽火遍及全国各地。
    起义者现在控制的主要地区有：首都贝鲁特的巴斯塔等穆斯林居住区，起义部队领袖为民族阵线领袖、前总理萨拉姆；北部主要城市的黎波里的大部分，起义部队领袖为阿拉伯解放党领袖、前总理卡拉米；东北部的赫迈尔地区和贝卡盆地北部，起义部队领袖为前议会议长哈马德；中部德鲁兹人聚居的舒弗山区，起义部队领袖为社会主义进步党领导人琼卜拉特；南方重要城市赛伊达的一部分，起义部队领袖为议员萨德；在南方两大城市赛伊达和特尔以东的一片地区，起义部队领袖是前议会议长阿萨德。这些起义部队还没有统一的司令部。
    在政治方面，执行亲西方政策的夏蒙已经越来越孤立，反对他的包括国内绝大多数党派，所有的前总统、前总理和多数前部长。他的政府中也已有几个部长先后辞职。他的一个支持者、议会议员胡斯宣布全家参加起义部队，夏蒙是基督教马龙派教徒，他力图把这一次斗争说成为不同宗教之间的斗争，以骗取所有马龙派教徒支持他，但是马龙派的大主教迈乌什和所有主教也都表示要求他立即下台。夏蒙倚靠警察宪兵镇压起义部队，但是他们之中也有许多参加了起义部队。
    不过，反对夏蒙的各起义部队领袖虽然在反对夏蒙并要求他立即辞职一点是一致的，但是在对外政策的态度方面不尽相同，有的政党要求改变损害民族利益的投靠美国的政策，有的却只限于要求臭名昭彰的夏蒙下台，由别人接替他担任总统。
    美英帝国主义者的武装干涉阴谋在社会主义国家和全世界人民的反对下已经遭到初步挫折。他们在继续源源运送武器支持夏蒙并继续积极准备武装干涉的同时，正加紧进行幕后阴谋活动，以图诱使反对党派在有利于帝国主义和反动派的条件下妥协。据西方通讯社透露，由于看到夏蒙已经太臭，美英帝国主义者也已经准备在一定条件下同意撤换夏蒙，以便通过新的方式来控制黎巴嫩。有消息说，帝国主义者和夏蒙集团正在策划在7月24日召开议会会议选举新总统。阿拉伯舆论指出，这样做的目的是为了“选出”一个继续为帝国主义利益服务的代理人。据报道，反对党派已经表示拒绝由夏蒙集团控制的旧议会进行选举，而主张重新选举议会。
    同时，帝国主义者也没有放弃利用联合国旗号和唆使巴格达条约国家来干涉黎巴嫩的企图。据揭露，巴格达条约四个穆斯林成员国预定7月14日在土耳其伊斯坦布尔举行的会议，就是为了讨论干涉黎巴嫩问题。
    黎巴嫩爱国者正警惕地注视着美英帝国主义者及其代理人的阴谋。他们认为，只要对帝国主义不抱幻想，坚持维护民族独立的目标，坚持加强团结，所有这些阴谋都一定会被粉碎。
