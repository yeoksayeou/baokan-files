Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: The Soviet Photographic Art Exhibition opened this morning at the Beijing Art Exhibition Hall. The exhibition features a total of 116 outstanding works, many of which are natural color photographs. This exhibition is jointly organized by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Chinese Photographic Society, and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. After being exhibited in Beijing, these exhibits will continue to tour major cities across the country.

This morning, the opening ceremony of the exhibition was held at the Beijing Art Exhibition Hall. Wu Yuzhang, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said at the opening ceremony: The works exhibited not only reflect the magnificent natural scenery and interesting customs of the Soviet Union with vivid photographic art, but also fully reflect the rich and colorful life of the various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, and truthfully reflect the labor style of the Soviet people in communist construction; this exhibition will enable the Chinese people to further understand the life of the Soviet Union, and provide Chinese photographers with the opportunity to directly learn from the advanced Soviet photographic art. Therefore, it will play a great role in developing cultural exchanges between the two countries and strengthening the fraternal friendship between the two peoples.

Shi Shaohua, Chairman of the Chinese Photographic Society, said: The Soviet Union is the first country to elevate photographic art creation to the path of socialist realism; truthfully reflecting the great communist construction of the Soviet Union, and vividly reflecting the life and labor of the Soviet people, are the main features of Soviet photographic art. In the works of this exhibition, these features can be strongly felt. The exhibition of Soviet art works in China this time will be a good opportunity for the Chinese photographic art community to learn from the Soviet Union.

Soviet Embassy in China Counselor V.S. Lizichev then spoke. He expressed his gratitude to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Chinese Photographic Society for organizing this exhibition. He also hoped that this exhibition could make a certain contribution to further strengthening the cultural ties between the two countries.
