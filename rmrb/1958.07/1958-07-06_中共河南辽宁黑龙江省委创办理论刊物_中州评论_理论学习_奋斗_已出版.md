The CCP Henan, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang Provincial Committees Launch Theoretical Publications
"Zhongzhou Review," "Theoretical Study," and "Struggle" Now Published

(By our report) The "Zhongzhou Review," a bimonthly publication sponsored by the Henan Provincial Committee of the CCP, the theoretical publication "Struggle" sponsored by the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the CCP, and "Theoretical Study" sponsored by the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the CCP, were published on July 1.

"Zhongzhou Review" is the name of the theoretical publication of the Henan Party organization in 1925. This publication will now raise even higher than in 1925 a red flag guiding the people of the province to carry out the struggle on the ideological front. The inaugural issue published an article by Wu Zhipu, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CCP, entitled "Right-Opportunism is the Main Danger Within the Party at Present." The article sternly exposed and criticized the thoroughgoing right-opportunist thinking of the former First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Pan Fusheng, on a series of major issues such as class struggle, cooperativization, and the unified purchase and sale of grain.

In the "Struggle" publication, Ouyang Qin, First Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the CCP, wrote an article focusing on criticizing the non-Marxist theoretical viewpoints that mystify theory. It also published several articles by grassroots cadres summarizing their experiences in the Great Leap Forward in production.

The inaugural issue of "Theoretical Study" published eight articles reflecting practical work, including "Resolutely Rely on the Working Class, Break Down Superstition, and Promote the Great Leap Forward in Production" by Xiao Chun, First Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the CCP.

    中共河南辽宁黑龙江省委创办理论刊物
    “中州评论”“理论学习”“奋斗”已出版
    本报讯　中共河南省委主办的“中州评论”双月刊，中共黑龙江省委主办的理论刊物“奋斗”，中共辽宁省委主办的“理论学习”，于7月1日出版。
    “中州评论”是1925年河南党组织理论刊物的名称。这个刊物现在要比1925年更高地举起一面指引全省人民开展思想战线斗争的红旗。创刊号上刊登了中共河南省委第一书记吴芝圃的文章“右倾机会主义是当前党内主要危险”。文章严肃揭露和批判了前省委第一书记潘复生在阶级斗争、合作化和粮食统购统销等一系列重大问题上的彻头彻尾的右倾机会主义思想。
    在“奋斗”刊物上，中共黑龙江省委第一书记欧阳钦写的一篇文章中，着重对于那种把理论神秘化的非马克思理论观点作了批判。同时还刊载了几篇基层干部在生产大跃进中总结出的经验性的文章。
    “理论学习”创刊号刊登了中共辽宁省委第一书记萧纯的“坚决依靠工人阶级，打破迷信，促进生产大跃进”等八篇反映实际工作的文章。
