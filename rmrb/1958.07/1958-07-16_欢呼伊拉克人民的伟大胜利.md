Editorial:

    The good news has arrived that the Iraqi patriotic soldiers, led by General Kassem, launched a revolution on July 13th, overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Faisal dynasty, the lackeys of U.S. and British imperialism, and establishing an anti-imperialist republic. Upon its establishment, the Republic's government immediately announced its adherence to the Bandung Conference principles and its withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact, which was manipulated by U.S. and British imperialism. From this point on, Asia has gained another country that has broken free from colonial shackles and achieved national independence, and another country that opposes aggression and loves peace. The spine of imperialism's aggression in West Asia has been broken, imperialism's line of aggression and war plans have been disrupted, and the Arab people's struggle for independence, the national liberation struggles of the entire Asia-Africa region, the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations worldwide, and the struggles of all people worldwide to strive for peace and oppose a new war, will all be greatly encouraged and enter a new period of upsurge as a result.
    We, the Chinese people, warmly congratulate the birth of the Iraqi Republic and warmly congratulate the great victory of the Iraqi people. Like the Iraqi people, the Chinese people have long suffered from the aggression and plunder of the imperialist powers and the oppression of the feudal rulers who were the agents of imperialism. Therefore, we feel brotherly sympathy for the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people. Although there are thousands of kilometers between our two peoples, we feel from the bottom of our hearts that the struggle of the Iraqi people is our own struggle; the victory of the Iraqi people is our own victory!
    The victory of the Iraqi people is a new development in a series of great victories achieved by the people of Asia and Africa, especially the Arab people, in recent years. The Egyptian people's struggle to defend the Suez Canal, the Syrian people's struggle to resist American aggressors, the Omani and Yemeni people's struggles to resist British aggressors, and the Lebanese people's ongoing struggle against the imperialist lackey Chamoun government are all preludes to the Iraqi people's struggle. The establishment of the Iraqi Republic is of particularly great significance to the people of Asia and Africa because Iraq's Faisal dynasty was the initiator of the Baghdad Pact and a cornerstone of U.S. and British imperialist aggressors in the Middle East. But now, with a thunderclap, this cornerstone has collapsed and has become an anti-imperialist outpost. The establishment of the Iraqi Republic not only directly aids the struggle of the Lebanese people, but also fundamentally changes the entire situation in the Middle East, greatly accelerating the process of the complete demise of colonialist forces in the Middle East and even the entire world. The imperialists have always been like this: they think they are sitting on a solid throne, but in the blink of an eye, the throne becomes a volcano.
    The imperialists will obviously not relax their interference in the people's struggle for independence. The troops of the American aggressors have already landed in Lebanon. All the jackals' masks have been dropped, and they are threatening to carry out armed intervention not only against the Lebanese people but also against the Iraqi people. But armed intervention cannot intimidate the people who are striving for independence. The liberation of Asian and African countries has never been without the threat of armed intervention, but what has been the result? The result is the shameful failure of imperialist forces and the glorious victory of the people of various countries striving for independence. U.S. and British imperialist intervention in Lebanon and the entire Middle East can only arouse a more widespread and resolute resistance from the people of the Middle East, and will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat like the Suez Canal incident. The strength of the Arab people is now greater than it was then, their struggles are converging into one, and the strength of the socialist camp countries, the loyal friends of all national liberation movements, is also greater than it was then. The interveners will be burned to a frazzle in the raging fire of national liberation throughout the Middle East, which they cannot control.
    Iraqi Republic Deputy Prime Minister Arif was right in his speech to the people: "You must know that to achieve complete victory, you must further oppose the conspiracies of imperialism and the agents of imperialism." We believe that the awakened Arab people, with the sympathy and support of the people of the world, will certainly be able to defeat any conspiracy and trick and direct intervention by imperialism. We, the Chinese people, like the vast people of Asian and African countries, like the vast people of socialist countries, firmly stand with the Iraqi people and the Lebanese people who are striving for independence and freedom.
    Long live the victory of the national independence movements in the Middle Eastern countries! Down with imperialist intervention!

### 欢呼伊拉克人民的伟大胜利

    欢呼伊拉克人民的伟大胜利
    喜讯传来，以卡塞姆将军为首的伊拉克爱国军人在7月13日发动了革命，推翻了美英帝国主义走狗费萨尔王朝的反动统治，建立了反帝国主义的共和国。共和国政府一成立，立即宣布奉行万隆会议原则，退出美英帝国主义所操纵的巴格达条约。从此，亚洲又多了一个挣脱殖民枷锁取得民族独立的国家，又多了一个反对侵略、爱好和平的国家。帝国主义在西部亚洲的侵略脊骨被打断了，帝国主义的侵略阵线和战争计划被打乱了，阿拉伯人民的独立斗争、整个亚非两洲的民族解放斗争、全世界被压迫民族的解放斗争和全世界人民争取和平而反对新战争的斗争，都将因此而受到巨大的鼓舞，进到新的高涨时期。
    我们中国人民热烈祝贺伊拉克共和国的诞生，热烈祝贺伊拉克人民的伟大胜利。中国人民同伊拉克人民一样，曾经长久受着帝国主义列强的侵略和掠夺，长久受着帝国主义代理人封建统治者的压迫，因而对于伊拉克人民的英勇斗争，格外感到兄弟般的同情。虽然在我们两国人民之间还隔着几千公里的距离，但是我们从内心觉得，伊拉克人民的斗争，就是我们自己的斗争；伊拉克人民的胜利就是我们自己的胜利！
    伊拉克人民的胜利是亚非人民特别是阿拉伯人民近年来一系列巨大胜利的新发展。埃及人民保卫苏伊士运河的斗争，叙利亚人民反抗美国侵略者的斗争，阿曼和也门反抗英国侵略者的斗争，黎巴嫩人民现在还在进行着的反抗帝国主义走狗夏蒙政府的斗争，都是伊拉克人民斗争的前奏。伊拉克共和国的成立对于亚非人民有特别重大的意义，因为伊拉克的费萨尔王朝是巴格达条约的倡议者，是美英帝国主义侵略者在中东的基石。但是现在霹雳一声，这块基石陷落了，而且变成了反帝国主义的前哨阵地。伊拉克共和国的成立不但直接援助了黎巴嫩人民的斗争，而且根本改变了整个中东的形势，大大加速了殖民主义势力在中东以至在全世界彻底覆灭的过程。帝国主义者从来就是这样的：他们自以为坐在稳固的宝座上，但是一转眼之间，宝座就变成了火山。
    帝国主义者显然不会放松对于争取独立的人民的干涉。美国侵略者的军队已经在黎巴嫩登陆。一切豺狼的假面具都放下了，他们威胁着不但要对黎巴嫩人民而且要对伊拉克人民进行武装干涉。但是武装干涉吓不倒争取独立的人民。亚非各国的解放没有不受过武装干涉的威胁，但是结果如何呢？结果是帝国主义势力的可耻的失败，是争取独立的各国人民的光荣的胜利。美英帝国主义者对于黎巴嫩和整个中东的干涉，只能引起中东人民更加广泛和坚决的反抗，最后必然要遭到像苏伊士运河事件一样的可耻失败。阿拉伯人民现在的力量比那时更强大了，他们的斗争正在汇合成一片，而一切民族解放运动的忠实友人——社会主义阵营各国的力量也比那时更强大了。干涉者将在他们所无法控制的整个中东的民族解放的熊熊怒火之中烧得焦头烂额。
    伊拉克共和国政府副总理阿里夫对人民的演说说得对：“你们必须知道，要取得完全胜利必须进一步反对帝国主义的阴谋和帝国主义的代理人。”我们相信，觉醒了的阿拉伯人民在全世界人民的同情和支援下一定能够战胜帝国主义的任何阴谋诡计和直接干涉。我们中国人民同亚非各国广大的人民一样，同社会主义各国广大的人民一样，坚决地同争取独立自由的伊拉克人民、黎巴嫩人民站在一起。
    中东各国的民族独立运动的胜利万岁！打倒帝国主义干涉！
