    Get Rid of the Illusion About “Tails”
    Liu Jia
    I would like to say a few more words about the matter of "tails."

    Many people know that the kind of "tail" that "juts" out from the masses is foolish and harmful, so not only should it not "jut out," but it should be cut off at the root. However, some people love this "tail," saying it is useful. Others have even composed two lines of lyrics to praise the "tail": "Coercive orders are a good method; persuasion and education are too troublesome." There is yet another type of person who, while not loving this "tail," loves the people who grow these "tails," considering them proactive, daring, and vanguards. Associating the person with the thing, while praising their proactive spirit, they are often unwilling to cut off their "tails" at the same time. It is said that they are afraid of deflating their spirit and dampening their enthusiasm.

    The "tail" and the person must be seen in connection, but also distinguished. In terms of the enthusiasm for building socialism, this person is good, willing to work and daring to do so, and can even be seen as a vanguard; the "tail" on them is merely a "tail," and comparatively, it is only one of ten fingers. However, this "tail" is indeed foolish and harmful, and must be cut off; moreover, once the tail "juts" higher than the head, even the person's original value is worth re-evaluating. Therefore, as long as this "tail" exists, one must fight against it.

    As for those who favor "tails," I believe this is due to an excessive reliance on the effect of their own "tails." These people have an illusion that their "tails" are more effective than the Party's correct policies. They seem to think that the masses do not value whether the Party's policies are correct or not, but only look at how high their tails are jutting. Unlike Comrade Shen Changlin, who sees the actions of the masses as the masses' trust in the Party, and as the masses seeing "great prospects" from the Party's policies, and therefore actively responding, they actually believe that it is their "tails" that "drive" them. Therefore, instead of working to consolidate the Party's connection with the masses, they insert their tails between the Party and the masses, severing this connection.

    These people have not even comparatively considered why the tails of the former Kuomintang rulers were thicker and harder than their tails, but the result was that they still could not drive the masses, but instead were driven away and eliminated by the masses led by the Party, tails and all. Could it be that the masses just happen to be superstitious about their little tails and dare not move them even a bit? No, as far as the masses are concerned, although they see that they are not good, they still recognize them as their own people, so "a leperous son is still one's own good son," and they are unwilling to treat them like the Kuomintang.

    The harm of the "tail" lies in the fact that it severs the connection between the Party and the masses, it hinders the masses from deeply understanding the Party's policies, it undermines the enhancement of the masses' sense of responsibility as masters and the exertion of their enthusiasm for construction, and it undermines the implementation of the Party's mass line. From this it can be said that cadres with tails are not good cadres, and those who are superstitious and favor tails are not good cadres either; they are even less worthy of being called leaders of the masses.

    If we were to distinguish between good and bad cadres in this aspect, I believe that both are the same in terms of supporting socialism and supporting the leadership of the Party; therefore, in the final analysis, we are one family. However, there is also a fundamental difference between the two. The former believes that only the masses are the most reliable force for realizing the Party's policies and lines; the latter believes that only he himself is the most reliable force, and the masses are only there for him to drive; the former stands in front of the masses and takes the lead in everything, while the latter stands behind the masses to supervise; the former uses the method of mobilizing and leading, while the latter uses the method of coercion and driving. From this it seems that this opposition is not just an opposition of two methods, but also an opposition of two fundamental viewpoints and stances. People should naturally be won over through education, but principles cannot be compromised; tails must be cut off.

    Some of our comrades must also see clearly that their tails were passed down from the Kuomintang rulers, and are an ominous thing that cannot be blindly trusted. Just like smoking opium, it not only does not cure diseases, but will destroy oneself. Those with backbone should cut it off themselves.

### 要去掉对“尾巴”的错觉

    要去掉对“尾巴”的错觉
    刘甲
    关于“尾巴”的事想再说几句。
    许多人都知道，那种对群众“乍”起来的“尾巴”是愚蠢的，有害的，所以不仅不“乍”，而且要连根割掉它。但有人却爱这“尾巴”，说它顶事。还有人编了两句唱词歌颂“尾巴”：“强迫命令好办法，说服教育太麻烦。”另有一种人，虽不爱这“尾巴”，却爱这长“尾巴”的人，认为他们积极，敢干，是急先锋，因人及物，在表扬他们的积极精神的时候，往往却不肯同时去割他们的“尾巴”。据说是怕泄了他们的气，挫伤了他们的积极性。
    “尾巴”和人是既要联系起来看，又要加以区别的。就建设社会主义的积极性来说，这人是好的，肯干、敢干，也可以看作是急先锋；这“尾巴”在他们身上仅仅是一条“尾巴”，比较起来，不过是十个指头中的一个。但是这“尾巴”又确是愚蠢而有害的，非割掉不可；而且，一旦当尾巴“乍”得高过头顶的时候，连人的原有价值，也就值得重新估价了。所以只要还存在这条“尾巴”，便非同这条“尾巴”斗争不可。
    至于偏爱“尾巴”的，我以为这是过于信赖了自己“尾巴”的作用的缘故。这种人有一种错觉，以为他们的“尾巴”要比党的正确政策更有作用，他们似乎认为，群众并不重视党的政策正确与否，而只看他们尾巴乍的高低。他们不像申长林同志那样，把群众的行动，看作是群众对党的信任，是群众从党的政策中看到了“大奔头”，所以积极起来响应。相反，他们居然认为这是他们的“尾巴”“赶”起来的。因此，他们不是从工作中致力于巩固党同群众的联系，而是在党同群众之间横进了他们的尾巴，隔断这种联系。
    这种人完全没有比较着想一想，为什么以前国民党统治者的尾巴，要比他们的尾巴，粗得多，硬得多，但结果也还不能把群众赶起来，反而是连尾巴带人都被党所领导的群众赶走了，消灭了，难道群众就偏偏迷信他们的这条小尾巴，反而不敢动它一动吗？不是的，在群众来说，虽然看到他们不好，但还认得他们是自己人，所以“癞痢头儿子是自己的好”，不肯像对待国民党那样去对待他们罢了。
    “尾巴”的害处就在于，它隔断着党同群众的联系，它阻碍着群众去深入的理解党的政策，它破坏着群众主人翁责任感的增强和建设积极性的发挥，破坏着党的群众路线的贯彻。由此可以说，长了尾巴的干部不能算是好干部，迷信和偏爱尾巴的也不是好干部，他们更不配称作群众的领袖。
    倘要在这个方面区分一下好的和不好的干部的同异，我以为，两者在拥护社会主义，拥护党的领导方面是相同的；因此归根到底我们是一家人。但是两者又有根本的不同，前者认为只有群众才是实现党的政策、路线的最可靠的力量；后者则认为只有他自己才是最可靠的力量，而群众只不过供他驱使而已；前者是站在群众的前面处处带头，后者是站在群众的后面监督，前者用的方法是发动和领，而后者用的方法是逼迫和赶。由此看来，这对立不只是两种方法的对立，而且是两种根本观点和立场的对立。对人自然要争取教育，对原则却不能让步；尾巴一定要割。
    我们的一些同志也必须看明白，他们的尾巴，还是从国民党统治者那里传来的，是不祥之物，迷信不得的。就如同吸食鸦片，不仅治不得病，而且会毁灭自己的。有骨气的人，还是自己把它割掉的好。
