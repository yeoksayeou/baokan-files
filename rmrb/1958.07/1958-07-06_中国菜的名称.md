    Names of Chinese Dishes

    Chinese dishes are not only diverse in their preparation, possessing a high level of skill and artistry in cooking techniques, but the names of the dishes are also quite refined. The origins of dish names are roughly as follows:

    Named according to the main cooking processes such as frying, deep-frying, braising, and roasting, such as fried shrimp, smoked fish.

    Named according to the main seasonings and ingredients used, such as spicy diced meat, pigeon egg abalone.

    Named according to the taste of the dish, such as "strange flavor" chicken, sweet and sour pork ribs.

    Named according to the origin of the dish, such as Beijing roast duck, Shandong braised chicken, and other local flavors.

    Named after the color of the dish, such as jade winter melon, jade soup, jade dumplings, jade meatballs. Their color is emerald green, like jade.

    Named after the shape of the dish, such as yuanbao (ingot) meat, braised pork served with a half of a fried egg, the shape of the egg resembling a yuanbao.

    Many are symbolic, such as "ancient meat," the shape of the fried meat resembling the moon, implying eternal youth. "Imperial Concubine Chicken" is chicken wings soaked in wine and then braised, referencing the story of the Drunken Concubine.

    Many are named after people, such as Taibai duck, said to be a favorite dish of the Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai to enjoy with wine. Dongpo pork is a dish that the Song Dynasty scholar Su Dongpo often used to entertain guests (there are two theories about this dish, one saying that it was created by Su Dongpo, and the other saying that it was created by a monk who was close to him). There is also the famous Sichuan dish, Gong Bao chicken. Gong Bao was originally an official title in the Qing Dynasty. It is said that a Gong Bao with the surname Ding liked to eat this dish, so it was called Gong Bao chicken.

    There are also many beautiful and melodious dish names, such as "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix," "Hundred Birds Returning to the Nest," "Phoenix Lying on the Eastern Bed," and "Peacock Spreading its Tail." These dishes are not only delicious but also beautifully arranged, and their names are also very vivid and imaginative.

    中国菜的名称
    中国菜不但作法花样繁多，在烹饪技术和艺术性方面具有很高的水平，菜的名称也是相当考究的。菜的命名来由，大致如下：
    根据煎、炸、烧、烤等主要烹饪工序命名，如炸虾、熏鱼。
    根据所用主要调料和配料命名，如辣子肉丁、鸽蛋鲍鱼。
    根据菜的口味命名，如怪味鸡、糖醋排骨。
    根据菜的产地命名，如北京烤鸭、山东扒鸡等地方风味。
    因菜的颜色命名，如翡翠冬瓜、翡翠汤、翡翠饺子、翡翠丸子。以其色泽碧绿，如同翡翠一般。
    因菜的形状命名，如元宝肉，烧肉配成半个的炸鸡蛋，蛋的形状像元宝。
    有许多是象义的，如古老肉、煎肉的形状像月亮，取万古常青之意。贵妃鸡是鸡翅用葡萄酒浸过再烧，这里引用贵妃醉酒一个典故。
    有许多是因人而名的，如太白鸭子，相传唐代诗人李白最喜用这个菜来饮酒。东坡肉是宋时文人苏东坡经常用来招待宾友的菜（关于此菜有两种说法，一说是苏东坡创造的，一说是与他相好的一个和尚创造的）。还有四川名菜宫保鸡，宫保本是清朝的官名，据说当时有个姓丁的宫保喜欢吃这个菜，所以就叫宫保鸡了。
    还有很多美妙动听的菜名，如百鸟朝凤、百鸟归巢、凤卧东床、孔雀开屏。这些菜不但作的口味好，布置美观漂亮，而且取名也非常生动形象。
