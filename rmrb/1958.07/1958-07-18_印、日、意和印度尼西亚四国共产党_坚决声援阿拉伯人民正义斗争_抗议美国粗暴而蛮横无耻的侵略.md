Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th: The Secretariat of the Communist Party of India issued a statement this afternoon, strongly condemning the landing of American troops in Lebanon. The statement said, "This action by the United States is a blatant aggression and an unreasonable interference in the internal affairs of other countries." The statement also said, "The American monopoly capitalists who rule the United States are facing a growing economic crisis at home, and they are trying to solve it by gambling abroad."

The statement pointed out that the US government "not only disregards and insults the United Nations, but also violates the UN Charter. The purpose of the United States is clearly to present the United Nations with a fait accompli."

The statement said, "The collapse of the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine has made India more secure. Our own national interests are directly related to the victory of Arab nationalism."

The statement called on Prime Minister Nehru to come out against the US aggression against Lebanon, and demanded the immediate withdrawal of US troops and the adoption of emergency measures to consult with Bandung nations to save Asian peace and prevent the outbreak of a world war.

The statement finally called for rallies and demonstrations throughout India to condemn US aggression and express support for the Arab struggle for freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today, strongly protesting the US armed intervention in Lebanon and demanding the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon.

The statement condemned the United States for completely trampling on the UN Charter and for brazenly carrying out armed intervention in Lebanon, despite the UN Secretary-General's statement that the integrity and independence of Lebanon were not threatened by anyone. The statement pointed out that the methods used by the United States are exactly the same as those it used at the beginning of the Korean War, that is, to create a fait accompli of aggression before the UN Security Council has made a decision, and then to legalize its aggression.

In its statement, the Japanese Communist Party expressed its firm support for the just struggle of the people of Lebanon, Iraq, and other Arab countries for independence and peace.

The Japanese Communist Party also protested against the reactionary behavior of the Japanese government's representative to the United Nations in supporting the US proposal to the UN Security Council, which attempts to legalize its aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 16th (TASS): The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, in an appeal to the Italian people, resolutely condemned the "crude, arrogant, and shameless aggression" of the US imperialists against the independence and freedom of Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and other Arab countries.

The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party believes that Italian ports must not be allowed to be used as bases for Anglo-American imperialist adventures.

The Italian Communist Party Central Committee finally called on the people to hold demonstrations throughout the country to protest imperialist aggression and support the peoples of the countries that have been invaded.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 17th: Today's "People's Daily" reported that Lukman, Deputy Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Indonesia, sent a telegram to the US Ambassador to Indonesia, Howard Jones, on the evening of the 16th, strongly protesting the US military's aggression against Lebanon.

In the telegram, Lukman said, I represent one million Indonesian communists and eight million voters who support the Indonesian Communist Party in expressing our strong protest against the landing of US troops in Lebanon. If the US government does not stop its aggression against Lebanon in the short term, then its enterprises in Indonesia will suffer the same fate as the British and French enterprises in Indonesia suffered when Britain and France invaded Egypt.

When Britain and France invaded Egypt, Indonesian dockworkers, oil workers, and aviation workers boycotted British and French enterprises in support of the Egyptian people's just struggle against aggression.

In a telegram to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio, the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union demanded that the Indonesian government take diplomatic measures to stop the US aggression against Lebanon. The All-Indonesia Central Trade Union strongly condemned the US armed interference in the internal affairs of the Lebanese people, and demanded that US troops withdraw from Lebanon immediately.

The telegram also said that the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union will join workers from other organizations and all the Indonesian people in launching a movement to support Lebanon.

    印、日、意和印度尼西亚四国共产党
    坚决声援阿拉伯人民正义斗争
    抗议美国粗暴而蛮横无耻的侵略
    新华社新德里16日电　印度共产党书记处今天下午发表声明，严厉谴责美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆的行为。声明说，“美国这种行动是一种露骨的侵略和对他国内政的无理干涉。”声明又说，“统治美国的美国垄断资本家在国内面临着日益增长的经济危机，他们企图用在国外进行赌博的办法来加以解决”。
    声明指出，美国政府“不仅无视和侮辱了联合国，而且也违反了联合国的宪章。美国的目的显然是要使联合国面临一个既成事实”。
    声明说，“巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义的垮台使印度国家更安全了。我们自己的国家利益是和阿拉伯民族主义的胜利直接有关的。”
    声明呼吁尼赫鲁总理出来反对美国对黎巴嫩的侵略，并且要求立即撤退美国军队和采取紧急步骤来和万隆国家商量，以挽救亚洲的和平和防止爆发世界大战。
    声明最后号召在全印度举行集会和示威游行，以谴责美国的侵略和表示声援阿拉伯争取自由的斗争。
    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会常任干部会今天发表声明，强烈抗议美国武装干涉黎巴嫩，并且要求美军立即撤出黎巴嫩。
    声明谴责美国完全蹂躏了联合国宪章，并且不顾联合国秘书长关于证实黎巴嫩的完整和独立并没有受到任何人的威胁的声明，悍然对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉。声明指出，美国玩弄的手法同它在朝鲜战争开始的时候所玩弄的手法完全一样，即在联合国安全理事会还没有作出决定以前，先造成侵略的事实，然后再把它的侵略行动合法化。
    日本共产党在声明中表示坚决支持黎巴嫩、伊拉克人民以及其它阿拉伯国家人民争取独立与和平的正义斗争。
    日本共产党同时抗议日本政府驻联合国的代表支持美国向联合国安全理事会提出的企图使它的侵略行动合法化的提案的反动行为。
    据新华社17日讯　塔斯社罗马16日讯：意大利共产党中央委员会在给意大利人民的呼吁书中坚决谴责美帝国主义者对黎巴嫩、约旦、伊拉克和其他阿拉伯国家的独立和自由的“粗暴而蛮横无耻的侵略。”
    意大利共产党中央委员会认为，决不能允许意大利的港口被用来作为美英帝国主义冒险的基地。
    意共中央最后号召人民在全国范围内举行示威游行，抗议帝国主义侵略，声援遭到侵略的各国人民。
    新华社雅加达17日电　今天“人民日报”报道，印度尼西亚共产党副总书记鲁克曼在16日晚上打电报给美国驻印度尼西亚大使霍华德·琼斯，强烈抗议美国军队侵略黎巴嫩的行为。
    鲁克曼在电报中说，我代表一百万印度尼西亚共产党员和支持印度尼西亚共产党的八百万选民对美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆一事表示强烈的抗议。如果美国政府不在短期内停止对黎巴嫩的侵略行为，那末它在印度尼西亚的企业将会遭到和英法在印度尼西亚的企业在英法侵略埃及时所遭到的同样的命运。
    在英法侵略埃及时，印度尼西亚码头工人、石油工人和航空企业工人都曾经对英法的企业实行抵制，以支援埃及人民反抗侵略的正义斗争。
    全印度尼西亚中央职工会在打给印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约的电报中，要求印度尼西亚政府采取外交措施来制止美国对黎巴嫩的侵略行动。全印度尼西亚中央职工会强烈谴责美国武装干涉黎巴嫩人民内政的行动，并且要求美国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩。
    电报还说，全印度尼西亚中央职工会将同其他团体的工人以及全体印度尼西亚人民一道发起支援黎巴嫩的运动。
