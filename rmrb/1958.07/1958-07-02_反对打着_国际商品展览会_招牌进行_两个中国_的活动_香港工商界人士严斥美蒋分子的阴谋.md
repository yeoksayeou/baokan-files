Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 30th - Xinhua News Agency reporter reports: US-Chiang elements in Hong Kong are currently planning a so-called "International Commodity Exhibition," attempting to use this to prop up the stinking signboard of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and cooperate with the United States in its political conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

This "International Commodity Exhibition," which aims to carry out political conspiracy activities against China, is being hosted by the "Kowloon General Chamber of Commerce," which is controlled by elements of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The "exhibition" is scheduled to open on August 8 this year, at the "Kowloon General Chamber of Commerce" premises, which are remote and small. The "exhibition" is expected to set up more than one hundred small stalls, of which the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique will turn the sixty-four stalls they occupy into a so-called "China Pavilion." At the same time, in addition to inviting Japan to participate, the US-Chiang also tried hard to pull in several commercial firms in Hong Kong from countries like Britain, Sweden, and Switzerland, attempting to add a touch of so-called "internationalism" to this exhibition. However, many foreign firms have expressed indifference to this so-called "international exhibition," and many Chinese-owned firms in Hong Kong have also refused to participate. The Chiang gang elements who are preparing this "exhibition" are feeling uneasy about the sluggish registration of foreign firms. At a meeting, they shamelessly stated that even if only two countries participate, it could still be considered an "international exhibition."

At the same time, the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique is paying unusual attention to this event. In May, a group of dirty fellows from Taiwan formed a so-called "Committee of Industrial and Commercial Circles of the Republic of China to Participate in the Hong Kong and Kowloon International Commodity Exhibition" to come to Hong Kong to prepare for this political transaction. Subsequently, they formed a so-called "Delegation of Industrial and Commercial Circles of the Republic of China to Participate in the Hong Kong and Kowloon International Commodity Exhibition," controlled by a group of CC Clique special agents, preparing to come to Hong Kong for activities in the near future. Yu Hung-chun, the Chiang gang's "Premier of the Executive Yuan," has repeatedly summoned the personnel of this "delegation," giving them instructions regarding the political conspiracy activities they will carry out in Hong Kong. All of this is to prop up the stinking signboard of the "Republic of China."

The political conspiracy activities carried out by US-Chiang agents in Hong Kong under the guise of the "International Commodity Exhibition" have aroused the anger of the Hong Kong industrial and commercial circles and compatriots from all walks of life. Many people in the industrial and commercial sectors have written letters to newspapers or made public statements exposing and condemning this despicable activity carried out by US-Chiang agents. They are also closely watching the attitude that the British authorities in Hong Kong will take towards the despicable political conspiracy activities carried out by US-Chiang agents in Hong Kong.
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong, July 1st - Hong Kong industrial and commercial figures are exposing and condemning the conspiracy of US-Chiang elements in Hong Kong to create "two Chinas" by using the preparation of the so-called "International Commodity Exhibition" as a pretext.

Kao Cho-hung, President of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, solemnly pointed out when he met with a Xinhua News Agency reporter on June 30, that there is only one People's Republic of China, and there cannot be two Chinas.

Tang Bingda, Treasurer of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, revealed to reporters that the so-called "International Commodity Exhibition" organized by the host of the "Kowloon General Chamber of Commerce" is a political conspiracy by the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique to cooperate with US imperialism in creating "two Chinas." He said: Taiwan is a part of our country's territory, and it will return to the embrace of our motherland sooner or later. We cannot tolerate anyone creating the conspiracy of "two Chinas." He hopes that the British authorities in Hong Kong will face up to this issue and stop the activities of the Chiang gang, because this is not beneficial to the relations between China and Britain.

Yeh Jo-lin, Deputy Treasurer of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Five Trades Joint Chamber of Commerce, also pointed out to reporters that the "International Commodity Exhibition" should be international in nature, while Taiwan is only a province of China. This is clearly a conspiracy to create "two Chinas" under a false pretense.

Liang Canhui, Chairman of the North and South Firms Association, believes that China and Britain have established diplomatic relations. If the British authorities in Hong Kong allow US-Chiang elements to engage in the conspiracy of "two Chinas" in Hong Kong, this is not in the interests of the people of China and Britain. He asked the British authorities in Hong Kong to express a clear attitude.

In addition, more than ten well-known figures in Hong Kong's industrial and commercial circles, including Huang Xinyan, Deng Dianchu, Huang Yanqing, Li Jingxi, and Wang Zhaofeng, have also successively published statements to newspaper reporters, accusing the Chiang gang elements of the "Kowloon General Chamber of Commerce" of creating the political conspiracy of "two Chinas." They all believe that the British authorities in Hong Kong have a responsibility to stop this international political conspiracy activity.

    反对打着“国际商品展览会”招牌进行“两个中国”的活动
    香港工商界人士严斥美蒋分子的阴谋
    新华社香港30日电　新华社记者报道：香港的美蒋分子最近正在筹办一个所谓“国际商品展览会”，企图借此抬出蒋介石集团的臭招牌，配合美国制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋进行活动。
    这个以进行反对中国的政治阴谋活动为目的的“国际商品展览会”，是通过一个由蒋介石集团分子把持的“九龙总商会”主办的，这个“展览会”将于今年8月8日开幕，地点就在偏僻而狭小的“九龙总商会”会所里，“展览会”预计要设立一百多个小摊位，台湾蒋介石集团把他们所占有的六十四个小摊位，搞成一个所谓“中国馆”。同时，美蒋除邀得日本参加外，还极力拉了英国、瑞典、瑞士等国家在香港的几个商行，企图为这个展览会的所谓“国际性”点缀点缀。但是，许多外国商行对这个所谓“国际展览会”都表示冷淡，香港许多中国人资本的商行也拒绝参加。筹办这个“展览会”的蒋帮分子，对外国商行报名冷落的情况感到心虚，他们在一个会议上无耻地表示：即使只有两个国家参加，也算是“国际展览会”。
    与此同时，台湾蒋介石集团却异常重视。5月份，台湾有一批肮脏的家伙组成了一个所谓“中华民国工商界参加港九国际商品展览会委员会”，来香港筹备这宗政治买卖，随后又组成了一个由一批CC系特务分子控制的所谓“中华民国工商界参加港九国际商品展览会代表团”，准备在短期内前来香港活动。蒋帮的“行政院长”俞鸿钧也一再召见这个“代表团”人员，对他们到香港进行的政治阴谋活动给予指示。而这一切，都是为了抬出一个“中华民国”的臭招牌。
    美蒋特务在香港以“国际商品展览会”为名进行政治阴谋活动，已经引起香港工商界和各界同胞的愤怒，许多工商界人士写信给报纸或公开发表谈话，揭发和斥责美蒋特务所进行的这个卑劣活动。他们并密切地注视着香港英国当局对美蒋特务在香港进行的卑鄙的政治阴谋活动，究竟采取什么态度。
    新华社香港1日电　香港工商界人士纷纷揭露和指责香港美蒋分子借筹办所谓“国际商品展览会”名义，来制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动。
    香港中华总商会会长高卓雄在6月30日接见新华社记者时，严正指出：中国只有中华人民共和国，不能有两个中国。
    中华总商会司库汤秉达向记者揭露，“九龙总商会”主持人筹办的所谓“国际商品展览会”，是台湾蒋介石集团配合美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋。他说：台湾是我国领土的一部分，它迟早都要回到我们祖国的怀抱，我们不能容忍任何人制造“两个中国”的阴谋。希望香港英国当局正视这个问题，制止蒋帮分子这种活动，因为这对中英两国关系是没有好处的。
    中华总商会副司库、港九五行联合总商会理事长叶若林也向记者指出，“国际商品展览会”应该是国际性质，而台湾只是中国的一个省，这分明是巧立名目来制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动。
    南北行公所理事长梁灿辉认为，中英两国已建立外交关系，如香港英国当局让美蒋分子在香港搞“两个中国”的阴谋活动，这是不符合中英两国人民利益的。他要求香港英国当局表示明确的态度。
    此外，香港工商界知名人士黄新彦、邓典初、黄燕清、李景熙、王兆丰等十多人，也先后向报纸记者发表谈话，指责“九龙总商会”蒋帮分子制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋。他们都认为香港英国当局有责任制止这种国际政治阴谋活动。
