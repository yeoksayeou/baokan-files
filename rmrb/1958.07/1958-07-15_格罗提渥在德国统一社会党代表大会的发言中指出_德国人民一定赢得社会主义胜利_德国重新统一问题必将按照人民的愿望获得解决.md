Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 13th: Otto Grotewohl, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, made an important speech today at the Fifth Congress of the SED. He said: Socialist construction cannot be accomplished spontaneously; it is the result of the conscious action of millions of working people. He emphasized that socialist consciousness is the solid foundation that determines and promotes the speed of socialist construction. He said: Recognizing the leading role of the Party in our country must become a constant element of the socialist consciousness of the working people. The great task of socialist construction can only be realized under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party of the working class. Whoever rejects the leadership of our Party in all aspects of national and social life is against socialist construction.

Grotewohl said that thanks to the socialist production competition, the total production value in the first half of this year increased by 11% compared to the same period in 1957, which is the result of the extensive application of dialectical materialism. It shows that applying dialectical materialism in socialist life will bring new and greater achievements. He then pointed out that applying dialectical materialism is not only a matter for workers and peasants, but also for researchers and technicians.

Referring to the issue of intellectuals in Germany, Grotewohl said: Today there are still a large number of intellectuals standing between the past they are familiar with and the present they do not yet understand in some cases. He called on scientists to participate wholeheartedly in the work of building the future.

Speaking about the reunification of Germany and the policy of the SED on this issue, Grotewohl said: The German working class has already taken the issue of reunification into its own hands and will solve it victoriously according to the wishes of the people. The victory of socialism has made the German Democratic Republic a center attracting the people of West Germany and tells the people of West Germany the truth: that the united working class is powerful. Grotewohl reiterated that the only path to reunification is the formation of a confederation of two German states. He also pointed out that without the unity of the German working class and all patriotic forces among the people, without struggle, the confederation of Germany cannot be realized. The imperialists' adventurous plan to retake the East and annex the whole of Germany into the aggressive North Atlantic bloc will not end well. This plan is simply not feasible.

Grotewohl mocked U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' statement that a "prosperous Western Europe" must continue to maintain an "irresistible attraction to Eastern Europe." Amidst warm applause from the audience, he said: "We do not feel any attraction whatsoever to this economic crisis and adventurous policy that will lead us to the end of an atomic war."

Grotewohl also condemned the recent proposal by the West German Federal Parliament to form a four-nation committee to solve the German problem as a deception of the West German residents. He expressed his complete agreement with Khrushchev's rebuttal of this "proposal" in his speech and pointed out that the West German Social Democratic newspapers' slander that Khrushchev was "obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany" was complete nonsense. He emphasized that "a peace treaty can only be concluded with a peaceful, democratic Germany, and never with a militarist, fascist Germany."

Grotewohl concluded by saying: "Our flag flies proudly and bravely above us. Its flag bearer—the German working class—is powerful, and the millions of German people united and following their flag bearer are invincible. They are full of confidence: 'Socialism must triumph!'"

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 13th: The Fifth Congress of the SED continued this morning. Park Jung-ae, head of the delegation of the Korean Workers' Party and Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Hoang Van Hoan, head of the delegation of the Vietnamese Workers' Party and member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Workers' Party, and Ti Ado Li, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Argentina, delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress successively.

Speakers at this morning's meeting included Hermann Matern, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the SED, Karl Moltmann, representative of the agricultural cooperative in Schmierin, Albert Stief, First Secretary of the Cottbus District Party Committee, Wolfgang Langhoff, manager of the German Theater, Hilde Benjamin (female), Minister of Justice of the German Democratic Republic, Werner Edner, First Secretary of the Zittau County Party Committee, and Otto Grotewohl, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the SED.

The congress will continue on the morning of the 14th. (Attached photo)

    格罗提渥在德国统一社会党代表大会的发言中指出
    德国人民一定赢得社会主义胜利
    德国重新统一问题必将按照人民的愿望获得解决
    新华社柏林13日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员、德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥今天在德国统一社会党第五次代表大会上作了重要发言。他说：社会主义建设不可能自发地完成，它是千百万劳动人民自觉行动的结果。他强调指出，社会主义觉悟是决定和促进社会主义建设速度的牢固基础。他说：承认党在我们国家的领导作用必须成为劳动人民社会主义觉悟的恒常的要素。伟大的社会主义建设任务只有在工人阶级的马克思列宁主义政党的领导下才能实现。谁拒绝我们党在国家和社会生活各个方面的领导，谁就是反对社会主义建设。
    格罗提渥说，由于社会主义的生产竞赛，今年上半年的生产总值比1957年同一期间提高了11％，这是广泛地运用辩证唯物论所产生的结果。它表明，在社会主义生活中运用辩证唯物论就会带来新的更大的成就。他接着指出，运用辩证唯物论不仅是工人和农民的事，而且也是研究人员和技术人员的事。
    在谈到德国的知识分子问题时，格罗提渥说：今天还有大批知识分子站在他们所熟悉的过去和在某些场合他们还不太了解的现在这两者之间。他要求科学家们全心全意地参加到建设未来的工作中来。
    在谈到德国的重新统一问题和德国统一社会党在这个问题上的政策时，格罗提渥说：德国工人阶级已经把重新统一的问题掌握在自己的手里了，并且将按照人民的愿望来胜利地解决这个问题。社会主义的胜利使得德意志民主共和国成了吸引西德人民的中心，并且告诉了西德人民这一真理：统一了的工人阶级是强大的。格罗提渥重申，重新统一的唯一道路是组成两个德国国家的邦联。他同时指出，没有德国工人阶级和人民中一切爱国力量的联合，没有斗争，德国的邦联就不可能实现。帝国主义者企图夺回东部和把整个德国并吞到侵略性的北大西洋集团中去的冒险计划是不会有好下场的。这个计划根本实现不了。
    格罗提渥嘲笑美国国务卿杜勒斯所说“繁荣的西欧”必须继续保持“对东欧的不可抗拒的吸引力”，他在全场的热烈掌声中说：“我们根本没有感到这种将把我们引向原子战争的末日的经济危机和冒险政策对我们有任何吸引力。”
    格罗提渥还谴责西德联邦议院最近提出的关于组成四国解决德国问题委员会的建议是对西德居民的欺骗，他表示完全同意赫鲁晓夫在发言中对这个“建议”的驳斥，并且指出，西德社会民主党报纸诬蔑赫鲁晓夫“阻挠缔结对德和约”的话完全是胡说，他强调指出，“和约只能同一个和平、民主的德国缔结，而绝不能同一个军国主义的法西斯德国缔结。”
    格罗提渥最后说：“我们的旗帜骄傲地、勇敢地在我们的上空飘扬。它的旗手——德国工人阶级是强大的，团结一致地追随着他们的旗手的德国千百万人民是不可战胜的，他们满怀着信心：‘社会主义一定要胜利’。”
    据新华社柏林13日电　德国统一社会党第五次代表大会今天上午继续举行。朝鲜劳动党代表团团长、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱，越南劳动党代表团团长、越南劳动党中央政治局委员黄文欢，阿根廷共产党政治局委员蒂阿多利先后向大会致祝词。
