Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd, Ankara Dispatch: Amidst the US and UK plotting to expand their aggression in the Middle East, the United States government evacuated the first batch of American citizens from Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, on the 21st. These ninety-two American citizens arrived in Ankara that afternoon.

In its statement ordering the evacuation, the U.S. State Department mendaciously claimed that the U.S. was evacuating its citizens from Iraq due to the "unstable situation" in Baghdad.

Arab opinion has pointed out that the United States and Britain are conspiring to further armed intervention in Iraq.

According to a report by United Press International, one woman among the American citizens evacuated from Iraq said that the situation in Baghdad was "completely calm." Prior to this, U.S. State Department Press Officer White had admitted on the 17th that all American citizens in Baghdad had been safe since the establishment of the Iraqi Republic. Their lives and property were being protected by the armed forces of the Iraqi Republic. The U.S. Ambassador to Iraq also expressed "admiration for the efforts made by the Iraqi Republic to maintain peace and order, and for their concern for American citizens."

The government of the Iraqi Republic decided on the 21st to open the border to allow American citizens to evacuate. Iraqi Republic Development Minister Rikabi wrote a letter on the same day to the embassies of various countries whose citizens were working on Iraqi development projects in various parts of Iraq, stating that all foreign staff were safe and working under normal circumstances. These foreign workers include many Americans.

    在美英策划扩大侵略中东声中
    美国开始从伊拉克撤侨
    新华社22日讯  安卡拉消息：美国政府在21日从伊拉克首都巴格达撤出第一批美国侨民。这九十二名美侨已经在当天下午到达安卡拉。
    美国国务院在它下令撤侨的声明中别有用心地扬言，美国从伊拉克撤出侨民是由于巴格达“局势不稳”。
    阿拉伯舆论曾经指出，美国和英国正在阴谋进一步武装干涉伊拉克。
    据合众国际社报道，在这批已经撤出伊拉克的美国侨民中的一位妇女说，巴格达的局势“完全平静”。在此以前，美国国务院新闻发布官怀特曾经在17日承认，自从伊拉克共和国成立以来，在巴格达的全部美国侨民都很安全。他们的生命和财产正受到伊拉克共和国武装部队的保护。美国驻伊拉克大使也曾经“对伊拉克共和国为了维护和平和秩序所作的努力，以及他们对美国公民的关心表示钦佩”。
    伊拉克共和国政府在21日决定开放边境，让美国侨民撤退。伊拉克共和国开发部长里卡比在同一天写信给有侨民在伊拉克各地为伊拉克发展工程工作的各国大使馆说，所有外籍工作人员都安全无恙，在正常情况下工作。这些侨民中包括许多美国人。
