Qinghai, Hebei, and Anhui Provincial Party Committees Convene Meetings to Implement the Spirit of the General Line
    Striving for High-Speed Advancement and Re-igniting the High Tide of the Great Leap Forward
    Sweeping Away the "Backwardness Theory" and Cutting Off Feelings of Inferiority
    The People of Qinghai Advance by Leaps and Bounds
    (Reported from Xining) At the recent Second Session of the Second Congress of the Chinese Communist Party of Qinghai Province, in accordance with the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and the General Line, the "Qinghai Backwardness Theory" and inferiority complex that had existed among cadres inside and outside the Party for many years were thoroughly examined and criticized, enabling various tasks to develop vigorously.
    Judging from the examination and criticism, conservative ideas and pessimistic views of various types, such as "Qinghai is backward" and feelings of inferiority, are quite common. They exist to varying degrees not only among cadres in the industrial sector, but also among cadres in the agricultural, pastoral, cultural, and educational sectors. In the industrial sphere, the main erroneous views are: Qinghai Province has a weak industrial base, a small population, no equipment, no technology, no funds, and no geological data, making it impossible to develop industry. They have insufficient understanding of the favorable conditions for developing industry - Qinghai Province's rich natural resources and the urgent demands of the broad masses of people for developing industry - and think too much about the difficulties. Whenever industry is mentioned, they think of how complex and difficult large factories and mines are in Tianjin, Shanghai, and Northeast China. Even if industry is developed, cities can do it, but rural and pastoral areas cannot; the eastern part of Qinghai Province, with a larger population, can do it, but the sparsely populated Qaidam Basin, with its long transportation lines, cannot. There is a lack of clear understanding of the route of relying on the masses to develop local industry, and the determination to be self-reliant is not strong. Whenever industry is mentioned, it is simply a matter of relying on the state and on foreign aid. Developing industry is seen as very mysterious, seemingly profound and unpredictable, and it is believed that developing industry is a matter for a few experts and professionals, and that "white hats" (laymen) cannot do it, let alone farmers wielding hoes. The policy of simultaneously developing large-scale industries and small and medium-sized industries has not been fully understood. Whenever industry is mentioned, it is about building large-scale, mechanized industries, and small and indigenous methods are looked down upon. Although the mysterious view of running small factories has been basically broken among the majority of cadres, the mysterious view of running large factories still exists. The same is true for geological work. In addition, many cadres, due to conservative ideas and individualism, are afraid of being criticized for saying the wrong thing, afraid of being criticized for doing the wrong thing, afraid of being labelled as "rash advances" if they do too much too quickly, with many concerns, hesitations, and anxieties. Therefore, they dare not think boldly, speak boldly, or act boldly.
    In terms of agricultural production increases, the representatives examined the conservative view that in the past it was always believed that production could only increase by a few percent each year, not by several tens of percent, let alone several hundred percent. It was believed that Qinghai is located on a plateau, with many mountains, little rain, drought, and a small population and abundant land, with backward cultivation, and cannot be compared with other provinces and regions, not striving for the upper reaches, and content with being in the middle. There are also superstitious views on the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. At the Fifth Enlarged Session of the Provincial Party Committee held this spring, only a high tide of animal husbandry production was mentioned, and there was no dare to mention a high tide of socialist transformation, for fear of causing chaos and disrupting production. The representatives also made a profound criticism of the conservative ideas and inferiority complex that exist in the cultural and educational fields, where they dare not think boldly and act boldly.
    After analyzing the above-mentioned erroneous views, the representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed that the common point of these views is that they only see the negative factors and not the favorable conditions; they only see things and not people, not the dynamism of people, not the power of the masses; they only see the static state of things and not the development and changes of things, lacking a dialectical viewpoint. Therefore, they dare not think, dare not act, dare not think independently, dare not create independently, and are sticking to old ways. All this is the main root cause of the emergence of "backwardness theory", "condition theory", inferiority complex, and so on.
    After liberating their minds and dispelling superstitions, various indicators leapt again and again during and after the meeting. For example, the Provincial Party Committee originally planned to produce 2 million tons of iron and 1 million tons of steel by 1962, but after discussion by the representatives, it was increased by more than double. In terms of agricultural production increase, the plan during the meeting was to exceed 1,000 jin per mu on average by 1962, but based on the production increase targets and measures proposed by various localities in the days after the meeting, it is possible to achieve a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin by 1959 and realize a thousand-jin province. Based on this situation, the Provincial Party Committee issued a call to achieve an average of 1,500 jin of grain per person this year and an average of 3,300 jin of grain per person next year.
    At present, in accordance with the spirit of this meeting and the call of the Provincial Party Committee, the people of all ethnic groups in the province are ushering in an unprecedented high tide of vigorously developing local industry, building reservoirs, accumulating and producing fertilizers, weeding, and topdressing.
    Hebei Puts Forward Fighting Slogans
    Strive to be Upstream, Strive to be First
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th) Since the summer harvest, a new situation of greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in Hebei Province has been formed. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened an enlarged meeting of secretaries of local and municipal party committees, and decided that party committee secretaries at all levels should grasp every step and not relax any link, and accelerate the development of agriculture, smelting industry, and mechanical industry.
    This year, Hebei Province increased its summer harvest by 66% under the drought conditions of three hundred days without rain, and the high-yield record of 5,103 jin per mu of wheat in Nanloudi Zhuotou Village, Anguo County, greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses, who put forward even higher harvest targets for autumn and next summer. The high tide of the leap forward in industry is continuing to develop. In the three months of April, May, and June, the province has built 500,000 factories and mines. A small factory in Dingxing County can manufacture 25 gas generators a day, and workers have made hundreds of thousands of inventions. Many new products have reached international standards.
    According to this new situation, the meeting unanimously believed that it is necessary to keep the spirit of continuous revolution, leap forward again and again, strive to be upstream, and strive to be first. In agriculture, we must strive for a bumper harvest in autumn and an even greater bumper harvest next summer. The main measures are: To realize water conservancy ahead of schedule. The water conservancy construction movement in the province, after nine months of hard work, has expanded the irrigated area by 65.91 million mu, which is more than four times the area developed in the province in the eight years since the founding of the country. Including the original water conservancy foundation, the total irrigated area in the province has reached 90.91 million mu, accounting for 71% of the province's cultivated land. However, under the severe drought this year, these water conservancy facilities cannot fully guarantee exemption from drought and flood disasters. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to build machine wells, small wells, large wells, and ponds, and all wells should be deeply drilled into machine wells. It is necessary to universally build machine wells this year, basically realize mechanical irrigation universally next spring, and basically eradicate the Haihe River after a winter and a spring of hard work. This huge river management project, second only to the Huai River management project, can be basically completed in just one winter and one spring. This will be a very spectacular miracle and a very arduous task. By fundamentally controlling the Haihe River, it is necessary to achieve a network of rivers and machine wells in the plains, terraced fields on slopes, water conservancy for terraced fields, and mechanization of water conservancy, so as to achieve double insurance against drought and flood. Secondly, carry out a movement to accumulate and produce fertilizers, requiring the accumulation of 3 trillion jin of fertilizer from now until before autumn to ensure that each mu of autumn crops is topdressed with 10,000 jin of fertilizer, and the average base fertilizer for wheat planting reaches more than 30,000 jin, and other autumn cultivated land is applied with 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. It is also necessary to carry out deep plowing, requiring a depth of more than 1.5 feet, and strive to deeply plow all wheat fields this year, and basically complete the deep plowing of all cultivated land this winter and next spring. It is also necessary to carefully select good seeds, densely plant all seeds, eliminate diseases and insect pests, and vigorously reform tools.
    In industry, the meeting believed that the most important issues in the next two years are steel, mechanical equipment, motor manufacturing, and railway construction, which must be solved by concentrating efforts. First of all, it is necessary to vigorously develop the steel industry in accordance with the policy of "attacking small ones, grasping medium ones, and actively preparing for large ones." This year, we must build 1,000 small iron-smelting furnaces and 50 small steel-making converters. The construction of the steel industry must hold high the red flag and strive for high-speed development. Indigenous methods and foreign methods must be combined, with indigenous methods as the main focus, and foreign methods should be learned from indigenous methods. We must first attack the small ones in order to support the large ones with the small ones, and supplement the foreign ones with the indigenous ones. It is also necessary to emphasize self-reliance to solve the supply of materials and equipment, and not wait for foreign aid. Secondly, it is necessary to vigorously develop the machinery industry. The main products are irrigation and drainage equipment, smelting equipment, power equipment, and machine tools. All localities must ensure the needs of the countryside for basically realizing the mechanization of irrigation this winter and next spring. It is necessary to grasp the construction of the electromechanical industry, and build mining machinery factories, general machinery factories, machine tool factories, farm tool factories, motor factories, and coking plants. In addition to engaging in some light industries based on local resources, county and township industries must build backbone factories in the second half of this year, such as small-scale mining sites, small blast furnaces, small converters, machinery factories, motor repair factories, small cement plants, and coal-to-oil plants. Counties should establish larger-scale and comprehensive utilization factories, and general factories, such as grain processing, can be built in districts and townships. County and township industries should have a complete system. The motor manufacturing industry must also keep up closely, and each prefecture must build a motor factory this year. Small silicon steel sheets must also be solved by themselves, and all localities must produce their own wires. Railway transportation construction must be carried out first, with both broad-gauge and narrow-gauge railways being built at the same time.
    The meeting emphasized that in order to better and faster complete the above tasks, all units, all regions, factories, and agricultural cooperatives must pay attention to cooperation. The meeting also put forward plans and opinions for vigorously developing education and carrying out technological and cultural revolutions, as well as carrying out scientific research work.
    Anhui Establishes the Status of the "Three Marshals"
    Striving to Become a Grain and Steel Base
    (Reported from Hefei) Reporter Yu Ming reported: The Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a meeting of cadres at the provincial, prefectural (municipal), and county levels. At the meeting, more than 1,400 responsible party cadres in the province conscientiously studied the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, further understood the essence of the spirit of the General Line, studied the lessons of the "saddle shape," and resolved to use greater revolutionary energy to vigorously develop grain production and the iron and steel and machinery industries, and take these three as the "three marshals" to drive the province's socialist construction to develop more comprehensively and by leaps and bounds. Not only will Anhui be turned into a rich granary, but it will also be built into a heavy industrial province and one of the national iron and steel bases.
    When studying and discussing the General Line, the meeting unanimously believed that the broad masses of cadres and people in the province are already actively implementing the General Line in their actual work with soaring energy. For example, since the winter of last year and the spring of this year, they have built 6 billion cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy, which is four times the amount of work done in the eight years since liberation; the people of the province have waged a tenacious struggle against drought, pests, and diseases, and have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of 3.3 billion jin of grain this summer. In industrial construction, it has blossomed everywhere in a few months, and there are already more than 24,000 projects that have been put into production and are under construction by the end of May. In addition, agricultural cooperatives have also set up more than 70,000 granular fertilizer plants, more than 1,000 biogas digesters, and more than 700 small hydroelectric power stations and hydraulic power stations. Construction in other areas is also advancing at an unprecedented speed.
    Those who participated in the meeting used the achievements they have made as described above to point out that the waiting of the "tide watchers" and "account book keepers" has failed, and will fail even more in the future. They also criticized the arguments of those with right-leaning conservative ideas, such as "condition theory," "gradualism," "empiricism," and "contradiction between more, faster, better, and more economical." They deeply realized the importance of putting politics in command and universally inserting red flags.
    Regarding the issue of the "saddle shape," the meeting believed that when the adverse current of anti-"rash advance" came, the Provincial Party Committee not only did not mention anti-"rash advance," but also insisted on criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, and withstood the adverse current. However, the loopholes were not completely plugged, and the wind of anti-"rash advance" still had some impact on some areas of Anhui, resulting in some losses in production in 1957. Many comrades, in connection with the work they led, examined this issue from the perspectives of ideology and position, and realized that they must further transform their ideology and position.
    After affirming the achievements made in the first half of the year and criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, the people who participated in the meeting were encouraged with greater energy, and unanimously expressed their determination to promote the "three marshals" of grain, steel, and machinery to develop at a higher speed, and create conditions for the comprehensive leap forward of socialist construction. In terms of grain production, on the basis of last year's 24 billion jin, we will strive to far exceed the plan of 40 billion jin of grain this year. We must overcome all difficulties and fight against drought, complete the summer planting plan, do a good job in field management, and strive for a bumper harvest in autumn.
    In industry, we will strive to double the total industrial output value this year compared with last year, and strive to exceed the total agricultural output value as soon as possible. Anhui has abundant mineral resources, and the meeting believes that it is entirely possible to build Anhui into a heavy industrial province and one of the national iron and steel bases. In order to achieve this goal, several municipalities directly under the province and Lu'an will be built into heavy industrial cities, and the masses will be relied on to vigorously develop the production of steel, coal, etc. using indigenous methods. In the machinery industry, it is required that each municipality expand and build some specialized machinery factories and general machinery factories in the next two years, each prefecture build a central machinery factory, each county build a comprehensive machinery factory, and each township and commune establish repair and assembly stations, forming a province-wide electromechanical industrial network, and strive for provincial self-sufficiency in machinery, laying the foundation for the realization of agricultural mechanization, rural electrification, and transportation modernization throughout the province.
    Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report at the meeting, which further strengthened everyone's confidence in changing the face of Anhui.

    青海河北安徽省委召开会议贯彻总路线精神
    力争高速度前进  再次掀起大跃进高潮
    扫除“落后论”砍掉自卑感
    青海人民大踏步前进
    本报西宁电  在最近召开的中共青海省第二届代表大会第二次会议上，根据“八大”二次会议和总路线的精神，彻底检查和批判了党内外干部中多年以来存在的“青海落后论”和自卑心理，使各项工作得以蓬勃发展。
    从检查批判中看，“青海落后”、自卑感等各种类型的保守思想、悲观论调是相当普遍的，不仅工业部门的干部中有，农业、牧业以及文教等部门的干部中都程度不同地存在着。工业方面主要的错误观点是：青海省工业基础薄弱，人口少，一无设备，二无技术，三无资金，四无地质资料，无法办工业。他们对办工业的有利条件——青海省天然的丰富资源和广大人民群众对于办工业的迫切要求认识不足，而对困难想的过多，一提到办工业，就想到天津、上海、东北等地区的大厂矿是如何复杂难办。即便办工业，城市可以办，而农村、牧区不行；人口较多的青海省东部地区可以，而人烟稀少、交通线长的柴达木盆地不行。对于依靠群众发展地方工业的路线认识不清，自力更生的决心不大，一提到办工业，就是单纯依靠国家，依靠外援。把办工业看得十分神秘，似乎高深莫测，认为办工业是少数内行和专家的事，“白帽子”（外行）办不了，拿锄头的农民更不行。对于大型工业和中小型工业并举的方针没有完全领会，一提到办工业，就是办大的，机械化的，而看不起小的和土法的。当前在大部分干部中对于办小型工厂的神秘观点虽已基本打破了，而对办大工厂的神秘观点仍然存在。对办工业如此，对地质工作也是如此。此外，还有不少干部由于保守思想和个人主义作祟，怕说错了批评，怕作错了检讨，怕搞得多快了反“冒进”，顾虑重重，畏首畏尾，前怕龙，后怕虎。因此，也就不敢大胆地想，大胆地说，大胆地作。
    在农业增产方面，代表们检查了过去总认为每年只能增产百分之几，不能百分之几十，更不能百分之几百的保守观点。认为青海地处高原，山多，雨少，干旱，人少地多，耕作落后，不能同其他省区比，不争上游，甘居中游。在牧业社会主义改造上同样有迷信观点。今年春季召开的省委第五次扩大会议上，只提出来个牧业生产高潮，而没有敢提社会主义改造也来个高潮，怕出乱子，怕破坏生产。代表们对文化教育方面存在的不敢大胆想、大胆作的保守思想、自卑感也做了深刻的批判。
    参加会议的代表在分析了上述错误观点以后，一致认为这些观点的共同点是，只看到消极的因素，而看不到有利的条件；只看到物，而看不到人，看不到人的能动性，看不到群众的力量；只看到事物的静止状态，而看不到事物的发展变化，缺乏辩证观点。因而也就不敢想，不敢作，不敢独立思考，不敢独立创造，因循守旧。这一切是“落后论”、“条件论”、自卑感等等产生的主要根源。
    在解放了思想和破除了迷信以后，在会议期间和会后各项指标一跃再跃。如省委原计划1962年生产铁二百万吨，钢一百万吨，经代表们讨论后，增加了一倍还多。农业增产方面，会议期间计划到1962年平均亩产超过千斤，但在会后的几天内根据各地提出的增产指标和措施看，到1959年达到亩产千斤，实现千斤省便有可能。根据这一情况，省委发出了今年每人平均粮食达到一千五百斤，明年每人平均粮食达到三千三百斤的号召。
    目前全省各族人民正按照此次会议的精神和省委的号召，一个大办地方工业、大搞水库、积肥造肥、除草、追肥的空前未有的高潮已经掀起。
    河北提出战斗口号
    力争上游  力争第一
    新华社天津8日电  夏收以来，河北省工农业生产更大跃进的新形势已经形成，中共河北省委最近召开各地、市委书记扩大会议，决定各级党委书记要步步抓紧，环环不放松，加快速度发展农业、冶炼工业和机械工业。
    河北省今年在三百天无透雨的干旱情况下，夏收增产66％，出现了安国县南楼底卓头村小麦亩产五千一百零三斤的高产纪录，因而大大地鼓舞了广大群众的积极性，他们对秋季和明年夏季提出了更加高的丰收指标。工业上的跃进高潮正在继续发展，四、五、六三个月来全省已建厂矿五十万个，定兴县一个小工厂一天能制造二十五台煤气机，工人们的发明创造达数十万件之多。许多新产品达到了国际水平。
    根据这种新的形势，会议一致认为：必须本着不断革命的精神，跃进再跃进，力争上游，力争第一。在农业上要力争秋季大丰收和明年夏季更大的丰收。主要的措施有：提前实现水利化。全省水利建设运动，经过九个月的苦战，已扩大灌溉面积六千五百九十一万亩，相当建国八年来全省发展灌溉面积的四倍多，连原有水利基础，全省水浇地已达九千零九十一万亩，占全省耕地71％。但是，在今年大旱的情况下，这些水利设施还不能充分保证免除旱涝灾害。因此，要继续大打机井、小井、大井、坑塘都要深锥成机井。要在今年普遍建成机井，明春基本上普遍实现机械灌溉，并且要苦战一冬一春基本根治海河。这一项仅次于治淮工程的巨大治河工程只要一冬一春就能基本完成，这将是一个十分壮观的奇迹，也是一个十分艰巨的任务。通过根治海河，要做到平原河网化，机井化，坡地梯田化，梯田水利化，水利机械化，达到旱涝双保险。其次，开展积肥造肥运动，要求从现在到秋前积肥三万亿斤，保证秋收作物每亩追肥一万斤，种麦底肥平均达到三万斤以上，其他秋耕地亩施底肥一万斤。还要大搞深翻地，要求深翻一尺五寸以上，今年麦田争取全部深翻，今冬明春基本上完成全部耕地深翻。还要精选良种、全部密植、消灭病虫害、大搞工具改革。
    在工业上，会议认为，今明两年内最重要的是钢铁、机械设备、电机制造和铁路修建问题，必须集中力量解决。首先是要本着“突击小型，抓紧中型，积极准备大型”的方针，大搞钢铁工业。今年一定要建成一千个炼铁小高炉和五十座炼钢小转炉，钢铁工业建设必须高举红旗力争高速度发展，要土法和洋法结合，以土为主，土中出洋，先要突击小型的，以便以小养大，以土补洋。还必须强调自力更生地解决材料和设备的供应问题，不要等待外援。其次，必须大搞机械工业。主要生产排灌设备、冶炼设备、电力设备和机床。各地要保证农村今冬明春基本实现灌溉机械化的需要。要抓紧机电工业的建设，把矿山机械厂、通用机械厂、机床厂、农具厂、电机厂、焦化厂都建设起来。县、乡工业除根据当地资源搞些轻工业外，今年下半年必须把骨干厂建设起来，如小型采矿场、小高炉、小转炉、机械厂、电机修造厂、小水泥厂、煤炼油厂等。县里要建立较大型的和综合利用的工厂，一般如粮食加工等，可建在区、乡。县、乡工业大体上要有一个完整的体系。电机制造工业也必须紧紧跟上，各专区今年都要建成电机厂。小型矽钢片也要自己解决，各地并且要自己生产电线。铁路交通建设必须先行，要宽轨、窄轨并举。
    会议强调提出，为了更好更快地完成上述任务，各单位、各地区，工厂、农业社都要注意协作。会议还提出了大办教育和开展技术革命、文化革命，以及开展科学研究工作的规划和意见。
    安徽确立“三大元帅”地位
    争取成为粮食钢铁基地
    本报合肥8日电  记者于明报道：中共安徽省委于最近召开了省、地（市）、县三级干部会议。会上，全省一千四百多党员负责干部，认真学习了“八大”二次会议的文件，进一步领会了总路线的精神实质，研究了“马鞍形”的教训，决心以更大的革命干劲，大力发展粮食生产和钢铁、机械工业，并以这三项为“三大元帅”，带动全省的社会主义建设更加全面飞跃发展。不仅要把安徽变成一个丰富的粮仓，而且还要建设成为重工业省，成为全国钢铁基地之一。
    会议在学习和讨论总路线时，一致认为全省广大干部和群众在实际工作中，已经在用冲天干劲，积极贯彻实现总路线。如从去冬今春以来兴修水利六十亿土方，为解放八年来所做工程的四倍；全省人民和干旱、病虫害作了顽强斗争，获得了今年夏季增产三十三亿斤粮食的空前大丰收。在工业建设上，几个月内，已经遍地开花，到5月底投入生产和正在施工的项目即有二万四千多个。此外，农业社还办起了七万多个颗粒肥料厂，一千多个沼气池，七百多个小型水电站和水力站。其他方面的建设也以空前未有的速度跃进着。
    参加会议的人，用上述所取得的成绩，指出“观潮派”、“算账派”的等待已经落空，以后更会落空。并批判了有右倾保守思想的人所持的“条件论”、“渐进论”、“经验论”、“多快好省矛盾论”等论调。深刻认识到了政治挂帅，和普遍插红旗的重要性。
    关于“马鞍形”的问题，会议认为，在反“冒进”逆流到来时，省委不但未提反“冒进”，而且还坚持批判右倾保守思想，对逆流是顶住了。但是漏洞未能完全堵塞，反“冒进”之风对安徽有些地方还发生了一些影响，以致在1957年的生产上受到了一定损失。不少同志联系自己所领导的工作，对这一问题从思想、立场上进行了检查，认识到必须进一步改造自己的思想和立场。
    经过肯定上半年所取得的成绩和批判右倾保守思想以后，参加会议的人鼓起了更大的干劲，一致表示决心，要推动粮食、钢铁、机械“三大元帅”以更高的速度发展，为社会主义建设全面跃进创造条件。在粮食生产方面，要在去年二百四十亿斤的基础上，力争今年远远超过四百亿斤粮食的计划。要克服一切困难和干旱斗争，完成夏种计划，作好田间管理工作，争取秋季的大丰收。
    在工业方面，力争今年的工业总产值比去年翻一番，争取尽快把工业总产值超过农业总产值。安徽有丰富的矿产资源，会议认为要把安徽建成重工业省，建成全国钢铁基地之一，是完全有条件的。为了实现这一目标，全省几个省直属市和六安都将要建成重工业市，要依靠群众用土法大力发展钢铁、煤等的生产。在机械工业方面，要求在今明两年内各市都要扩建和新建一些专业机械厂和通用机械厂，各专区建一个中心机械厂，各县建一个综合性机械厂，各乡、社建立修配站，结成全省的机电工业网，争取省内机械自给，为全省农业机械化、农村电气化和交通运输现代化的实现打下基础。
    中共中央书记处书记谭震林同志，在会议期间到会做了报告，更加坚定了大家改变安徽面貌的信心。
