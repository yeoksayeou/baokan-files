Jiangxi Five Hundred Plus Worker-Peasant Students
Admitted to Universities Without Examination

(Report from this newspaper) This year in Jiangxi Province, another 280 graduating senior high school students from worker and peasant families, and 224 graduates from worker-peasant rapid course middle schools, have been admitted to 33 universities and colleges across the country without examination.

These students are not only healthy and have relatively excellent academic performance, but also possess particularly good ideological character. A considerable number of them have repeatedly won the titles of "Three Goods" students and model Communist Youth League members. In various major political movements and central tasks led by the Party, they have been loyal supporters, propagandists, and organizers.

Among the 224 students from worker-peasant rapid course middle schools who were admitted to universities without examination, more than half were originally industrial workers. In the old society, they couldn't even afford to eat, and attending university was simply a dream for them, but today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, their dreams have become a reality.

Many of those admitted to universities without examination this time are skilled in labor production, including Yuan Feng'e, a special-grade model teacher of the province. After liberation, thanks to the Party's cultivation, she has now completed middle school and has been honorably recommended to Peking Normal University, Renmin University of China, and other schools.

    江西五百多名工农学生
    免试升入高等学校
    本报讯　今年江西省又有二百八十名工农家庭出身的应届高中毕业生，和二百二十四名工农速成中学毕业生，免试升入了全国三十三所高等学校。
    这些学生不仅身体健康、学习成绩比较优异，特别是思想品行优良。其中有相当一部分曾经多次荣获过“三好”学生和模范共青团员的称号。在党所领导的各项重大政治运动和中心工作中，他们都是忠实的支持者、宣传者和组织者。
    工农速成中学免试升入高等学校的二百二十四名学生中，有一半以上原来是产业工人。在旧社会他们连吃饭都顾不上，读大学对他们来说简直是一种梦想，而今天在共产党领导下却把梦想变成了现实。
    这次免试升入高等学校的很多是劳动生产中的能手，其中有全省特等模范教师袁凤娥等。解放后，由于党的培养，今年已经读完了中学，并光荣的分别被保送入北京师范大学、中国人民大学等学校。
