Xinhua News Agency, Leningrad, July 5th: The working masses of Leningrad held a rally in the Winter Palace Square on the 4th to welcome Antonín Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of Czechoslovakia. Khrushchev and Novotný spoke at the meeting.

    In his speech, Khrushchev pointed out that the people's democratic countries are not far from completing socialist construction and beginning the transition to communism. Czechoslovakia will build socialism in the next few years. He said that the basis of the genuine brotherly friendship between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia is the thought of Lenin. The Czechoslovak people have achieved great success because the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia follows Lenin's teachings in its work.

    Referring to the attempts of revisionists to split the international communist movement, Khrushchev stressed that communist and workers' parties are resolutely striking at the splitters. Khrushchev continued, the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia played an inglorious role and embarked on the path of revising the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism. They tried to prove that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries were carrying out a movement against Yugoslavia. Khrushchev said that we have said more than once that we have not and do not intend to carry out a movement against the Yugoslav people, but we will fight against all who revise Marxism.

    Novotný said that the friendship between the Soviet and Czechoslovak people is being consolidated and developed. He said that Czechoslovakia's achievements are due to the hard work of the Czechoslovak people and the fraternal cooperation with the Soviet Union.

    列宁格勒群众欢迎诺沃提尼
    赫鲁晓夫说南共领导人扮演了不光彩的角色
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社列宁格勒讯：列宁格勒劳动群众4日在冬宫广场举行大会，欢迎捷共中央第一书记、捷克斯洛伐克总统诺沃提尼。赫鲁晓夫和诺沃提尼在会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中指出，人民民主国家完成社会主义建设并开始向共产主义过渡已经为期不远了。捷克斯洛伐克将在最近一些年内建成社会主义。他说，苏联和捷克斯洛伐克之间的真正的兄弟友谊关系的基础是列宁的思想。捷克斯洛伐克人民之所以取得了巨大的成就，是由于捷克斯洛伐克共产党在工作中遵循着列宁的学说。
    在谈到修正主义者企图分裂国际共产主义运动的问题时，赫鲁晓夫强调指出，共产党和工人党正在给分裂分子以坚决的打击。赫鲁晓夫继续说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导人扮演了不光彩的角色，走上了修正马克思列宁主义基本原则的道路。他们力图证明苏联和其他社会主义国家在进行反对南斯拉夫的运动。赫鲁晓夫说，我们曾经讲过不止一次，我们没有、也不打算进行反对南斯拉夫人民的运动，但是我们要进行反对一切修正马克思主义的分子的斗争。
    诺沃提尼讲话说，苏捷两国人民的友谊正在日益巩固和发展。他说，捷克斯洛伐克所取得的成就是由于捷克斯洛伐克人民的顽强劳动以及同苏联的兄弟合作。
