Xinhua News Agency dispatch:
    The Arab public welcomes the Soviet Union's new initiative aimed at restoring peace and ensuring the security of the Near and Middle East. Cairo newspapers all published news about Khrushchev's letters in prominent positions, using large headlines to emphasize that the Soviet Union is demanding an immediate high-level conference to eliminate the crisis. In this regard, convening a high-level conference is an urgent matter and can be held anywhere.
    "Al-Shaab" wrote: "Khrushchev has requested that the heads of government of the United States, Britain, France, and India immediately hold talks, with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General, to stop the armed conflicts taking place in the Middle East. Under the current circumstances, holding such a conference is the most sensible action."
    "Al-Ahram" pointed out, "The current situation in the Middle East requires the urgent convening of a high-level conference to discuss the Middle East crisis." The occupation of Lebanon and Jordan may create dangerous consequences for the cause of peace.
    Lebanese newspapers summarized and published the letter from Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Council of Ministers to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, France, and India, and to the United Nations Secretary-General, which proposed holding a conference to resolve the military conflict that had already begun in the Near and Middle East. Beirut Radio broadcast excerpts of Khrushchev's letter.

    阿拉伯公众欢迎苏联制止中东战火的建议
    据新华社讯  阿拉伯公众欢迎苏联的目的在恢复和平和保障中近东安全的新倡议。开罗各报都以头栏地位刊载关于赫鲁晓夫信件的消息，并且用大字标题着重指出，苏联要求立刻举行高级会议来消除危机。在这方面，召开高级会议是刻不容缓的事情，它可以在任何地方举行。
    “人民报”写道：“赫鲁晓夫要求美国、英国、法国和印度政府首脑在联合国秘书长参加下立即举行会谈，来制止中东所发生的武装冲突。在当前情况下，举行这种会议是最明智的行动。”
    “金字塔报”指出，“中东当前的局势要求刻不容缓地召开高级会议来讨论中东危机”。黎巴嫩和约旦的占领可能给和平事业造成危险的后果。
    黎巴嫩各报摘要刊载了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫致美国、英国、法国和印度各国政府首脑以及联合国秘书长的信，这封信建议召开会议来解决已经在中近东开始了的军事冲突。贝鲁特电台摘要广播了赫鲁晓夫的信。
