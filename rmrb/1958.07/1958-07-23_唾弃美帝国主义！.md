    Spit on American Imperialism!
    Yang Shuo

    One day in mid-July, at cockcrow before dawn, I boarded a plane in Cairo to attend the Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference in Stockholm, Sweden. Looking down, the eastern shore of the Mediterranean was shrouded in smoke, filled with the flames of the Lebanese people fighting for freedom. The Mediterranean, however, was a deep blue, as clear as the sky. Suddenly, I spotted some small white dots on the sea. Were these the waves stirred up by the tide? No. This was the U.S. imperialist Sixth Fleet, lurking like sharks, spying on something.
    Arriving in Stockholm and entering the conference hall, I immediately had the feeling of stepping onto a large ship. The hall was made of wood, and the ceiling was arched, somewhat resembling a ship's hold, naturally giving one the feeling of being on a ship. I told this feeling to an Arab representative, and he smiled and said, "It's a bit like a ship, but not the Sixth Fleet, but a great ship of peace."
    Just as this great ship was sailing forward, the American pirates saw the Iraqi people emerge from the flames like a colorful phoenix and, disregarding everything, landed in Lebanon, attempting to hang the Arab people, who had already won their freedom, upside down again. The Arab representative said with excitement and anger, "Isn't this like setting fire to an oil depot?"
    I don't know if Eisenhower has thought about the even greater fire of justice he personally ignited in the hearts of mankind, a fire that will burn him to ashes.
    Let's take a look at the situation on the sailing ship of peace. More than a thousand people are gathered here, a microcosm of all mankind on the entire Earth. No matter how great the distance between their faces and thoughts, they shout out the same voice: Hail the victory of the Iraqi people! Denounce the crimes of imperialism! Representatives of the British people accused their government of armed intervention in Jordan. Representatives of the American people, with heavy and firm faces, stepped onto the podium and vehemently demanded that their government immediately withdraw its troops from Lebanon. Representatives of the people of Asia and Africa protested against the American aggression, and the entire conference unanimously passed a resolution condemning the United States.
    Dr. Hanna, the representative of Lebanon, stepped onto the stage, coming from war-torn Beirut. His hair was as white as snow, and he wore a fiery red tie. He shouted in a vibrant voice, "Imperialism is dancing on graves! The Lebanese people must decide their own destiny; we oppose any interference! Whether men, women, or children, we must fight to the end! All friendly friends around the world, extend your helping hands!"
    Yes, the helping hands have long been extended to the heroic Lebanese people. This is a white night in Northern Europe. Although it is actually midnight, the sky is as bright as dawn, with a few pale little stars sparsely shining. The Chinese delegation was sitting in a room, quietly listening to the broadcast from Beijing. From the radio came the sound of the Chinese people's mass rally against the American aggression in Lebanon. Five hundred thousand people in Beijing shouted in unison: "American troops get out of Lebanon!..." This powerful support from the Chinese people is connecting with the people of the world, doing everything possible to extinguish the flames ignited by the American pirates on the Middle Eastern oil depot.
  After Dr. Hanna spoke, amidst the applause of the entire audience, he extended his right arm, making the victory sign with two fingers, pointing straight ahead. The people of the entire Earth are pointing at the nose of U.S. imperialism with such confidence in victory. There is a Chinese saying: "One person's spit can drown you!" Spit on American imperialism! If you don't believe it, just try the power of the people of the world!

    唾弃美帝国主义！
    杨朔
    7月中旬的一天，黎明鸡唱，我从开罗坐上飞机，飞往瑞典的斯德哥尔摩参加裁军和国际合作大会。往下一望，地中海的东岸烟雾腾腾，弥漫着黎巴嫩人民争取自由的烽火。地中海却是一片深蓝，蓝得像天空一样透亮。忽然间，我在海上发现一些小白点。这是海潮卷起的浪花吗？不是。这是美帝国主义的第六舰队，它像鲨鱼似的正在窥视着什么。
    来到斯德哥尔摩，走进大会的会场，立刻给我一种感觉，好像跨上一条大船。会场是木头造的，顶棚又是弓形，有点类似船棚，自然令人有船的感觉。我把这种感觉告诉一位阿拉伯代表，他笑笑说：“是有点像船，不过不是第六舰队，而是一条和平的大船。”
    就在这条大船破浪前进的当儿，美国海盗看见伊拉克人民像只五色斑烂的凤凰从火中飞出来，便不顾一切地在黎巴嫩登陆，企图把已经争得自由的阿拉伯人民重新倒吊起来。那位阿拉伯代表激昂气愤地说：“这不是往油库上点火吗？”
    我不知道艾森豪威尔想没想到他亲手在人类心灵上点起的一把更大的正义的烈火，这烈火会把他烧成死灰的。
    且看看正在航行的和平大船上的情形吧。这里聚集着一千多人，这里却是整个地球的人类的缩影。不管他们的面貌思想有着多么大的距离，他们的嘴里却喊出完全一致的声音：欢呼伊拉克人民的胜利！痛斥帝国主义的罪行！英国人民的代表指责他们的政府对约旦的武装干涉。美国人民的代表带着沉重和坚强的脸色走上讲台去，大声疾呼地要求他们的政府立刻从黎巴嫩撤出军队。亚非各国人民的代表发出对美国侵略行动的抗议，整个大会更一致通过谴责美国的决议。
    黎巴嫩的代表汗纳博士，走上台去，他是从满地烽烟的贝鲁特来的。他的头发像雪一样白，系着一条火红的领带。他用富有生命力的声音喊道：“帝国主义是在坟墓上跳舞！黎巴嫩人民要自己决定自己的命运，我们反对任何干涉！无论男人、女人或小孩，我们一定要战斗到底！全世界一切友好的朋友，伸出你们援助的手吧！”
    是的，援助的手早已伸向英勇的黎巴嫩人民。这是北欧的一个白夜，虽说实际上已经半夜，天空却像黎明一样发亮，疏疏落落闪着几颗苍白的小星星。中国代表团正坐在一间屋里，静听着北京的广播，从无线电里传来中国人民反对美国侵略黎巴嫩的群众大会的声音，北京五十万人齐声高喊：“美军滚出黎巴嫩去！……”中国人民这种强有力的声援，正跟全世界人民连接一起，全力在扑灭美国海盗在中东油库上点起的火苗。
  汗纳博士讲话以后，在全场的掌声里，曾经伸出右胳臂，两根指头做出表示胜利的记号，直指着前方。整个地球上的人民就是这样满怀胜利信心地指着美帝国主义的鼻子。中国有句话说：“一人一口唾沫，也能把你淹死！”唾弃美帝国主义！不信你就试试全世界人民的力量吧！
