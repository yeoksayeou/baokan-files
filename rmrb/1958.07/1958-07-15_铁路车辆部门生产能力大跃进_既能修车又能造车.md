Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: A completely new atmosphere has emerged in the nationwide railway vehicle departments during the Great Leap Forward in production: they are not only capable of repairing vehicles but also of manufacturing them; and not only of manufacturing vehicles but also of making machines.

On July 12th, the vehicle department workers from the Beijing, Shenyang, Taiyuan, and Jinan Railway Administrations reported their successes to the Ministry of Railways with newly manufactured freight cars and many significant technical achievements.

Various reports of success indicate that workers have broken away from the old notion that vehicle depots can only perform general repairs and not advanced repairs (major and intermediate repairs of passenger cars, major repairs of freight cars), which had persisted for decades. The vehicle departments of the Beijing Railway Administration completed the major repair of two passenger cars, the intermediate repair of three passenger cars, and the major repair of twenty-three freight cars from June 9th to July 10th. The Shenyang, Taiyuan, Jinan, and other Railway Administrations also successfully completed major and intermediate repairs of passenger and freight cars.

In addition, they boldly experimented with manufacturing new vehicles. The Tianjin, Taiyuan, Changchun, and Jinan vehicle depots have all successfully trial-produced one new freight car each. The Shenyang, Beijing, Taiyuan, and other Railway Administrations are also trial-producing new types of passenger cars, preparing to present them as gifts for this year's National Day.

In order to manufacture new vehicles, they have put forward guarantees that, without requiring state investment, they will manufacture their own machinery, equipment, and tools. For example, the Jinan Vehicle Depot has begun to make its own steel and iron to manufacture vehicle parts. The Beijing Railway Administration has successfully trial-produced a 50-ton automatic pile driver.

In their reports of success, they also proposed to build cast iron wheel workshops, oxygen production workshops, rubber parts manufacturing workshops, plastic parts manufacturing workshops, glass plate manufacturing workshops, and storage battery manufacturing workshops in the shortest possible time to solve their own parts problems.

### 铁路车辆部门生产能力大跃进  既能修车又能造车

    铁路车辆部门生产能力大跃进
    既能修车又能造车
    据新华社14日讯　全国铁路车辆部门在生产大跃进中出现一个崭新的气象：不仅能修车，而且能造车；不仅能造车，而且能造机器。
    7月12日，北京、沈阳、太原、济南四个铁路管理局的车辆部门职工，以新造货车和许多重大的技术成就向铁道部报捷。
    各种捷报表明：职工们已经破除了几十年来车辆段只能作一般修理，不能作高级修理（客车大中修、货车大修）的陈旧观念。北京铁路管理局车辆部门从6月9日到7月10日完成了客车大修两辆、中修三辆、货车大修二十三辆。沈阳、太原、济南等铁路管理局也都大中修客货车成功。
    此外，他们还大胆试制新车。天津、太原、长春、济南等车辆段都先后试制成功新造货车各一辆。沈阳、北京、太原等铁路管理局还在试制新型客车，准备给今年国庆节献礼。
    为了制造新车，他们纷纷提出保证，在不要国家投资的原则下，自己制造机械、设备和工具。如济南车辆段开始自己炼钢、炼铁来制造车辆配件。北京铁路管理局试制五十吨自动镐已经成功。
    在报捷中，他们还提出要在最短期间建成生铁轮铸造车间、氧气制造车间，橡胶配件制造车间、塑料配件制造车间、玻璃板制造车间、蓄电池制造车间等，为自己解决配件问题。
