The US and Britain Launched Aggression Without Consulting West Germany
West Germany Should Not Provide Bases But Should Recognize Iraq
The widely circulated Hamburg "Bild-Zeitung" strongly opposed providing any supply bases or allowing airplanes to take off and land freely for the US and British interventionist actions in the Near East in its editorial.

The pro-government Bonn "General-Anzeiger" argued in its editorial on the 18th that the West German government should recognize the Iraqi revolutionary government as soon as possible. The newspaper said that perhaps West Germany's doing so would annoy the US and Britain, but "the Americans and British did not consult us when they took their dangerous actions."

    美英发动侵略并未征求西德的意见
    西德不应提供基地而应承认伊拉克
    销路很广的汉堡“图片报”在社论中强烈反对替美英在中近东的干涉行动提供任何供应基地或允许飞机自由起落。
    亲政府的波恩“总通告报”在18日的社论里主张西德政府应该及早承认伊拉克革命政府。这家报纸说，也许西德这样做会引起美英的恼怒，但是“当美国人和英国人采取他们的危险行动时却也并未征询我们的意见”。
