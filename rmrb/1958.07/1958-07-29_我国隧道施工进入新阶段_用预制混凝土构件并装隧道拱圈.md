Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th: China's tunnel construction has entered a new stage – the successful trial of using precast concrete components to install tunnel arches.

Recently, in the No. 29 Tunnel of the Baoji-Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway, the staff of the Engineering Department of the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways successfully used a large-scale "Tunnel Erection Machine" designed and manufactured by themselves to erect prefabricated semi-circular concrete arches on the side walls of the tunnel, with good results.

The old method of building tunnels in railway construction involved erecting model boards in the tunnel, transporting large amounts of concrete, and pouring cement in the narrow cave to line the tunnel arch. This method was not only complex and difficult to construct, but also could cause quality problems such as "honeycombing" and "pockmarking." The new construction method using precast components and mechanical installation can avoid these shortcomings and is also more efficient. This tunnel arch erection method can be widely used in tunnels with relatively good rock quality.

    我国隧道施工进入新阶段
    用预制混凝土构件并装隧道拱圈
    据新华社西安28日电　我国隧道施工进入一个新的阶段——用预制混凝土构件并装隧道拱圈试验成功。
    最近，在陇海铁路宝兰段二十九号隧道里，铁道部第六工程局工程处的职工，用他们自行设计和制造的大型“隧道并装机”，把预制成的半圆形混凝土拱圈，并装在隧道两旁的边墙上，效果良好。
    铁路修筑史上建筑隧道的老办法，都是在山洞里架起模型板，运进大量的混凝土，在狭窄的洞内灌注水泥，衬砌隧道的拱圈。这样作，不但工序复杂、施工条件困难，而且还可能造成“蜂窝”、“麻面”等质量事故。用预制构件和机械安装的新施工法，就可避免这些缺点，而且效率也高。这种隧道拱圈并装施工法，可在石质较好的隧道中广泛采用。
