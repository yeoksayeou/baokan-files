Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 29th: A TASS observer comments on the American reaction to Khrushchev's letter of July 28th to Eisenhower.

    The White House stated on July 28th that it would not comment on Khrushchev's letter to President Eisenhower, written on the same day, until the American President had received it. Of course, this is reasonable and natural. To respond to the letter, it must first be carefully studied. However, there are some "commentators" who are not "commenting" on what is written in the letter, but "commenting" on what is not in the letter. For example, according to Associated Press Washington correspondent Scali, "authoritative official sources" said that Khrushchev apparently rejected Eisenhower's insistence on holding a high-level meeting within the framework of the Security Council.

    United Press International reporter Bruce Mann also presented the matter in this way. He cited so-called "United Nations diplomats" as saying that in Prime Minister Khrushchev's recent letter, "the idea of holding a high-level meeting within the framework of the Security Council was apparently rejected."

    These "commentators" have put the cart before the horse, confusing a clear issue. To illustrate this point, let us look at the facts: As early as July 19th, the Soviet government, considering the serious situation at the time, and considering that the issue to be resolved was war or peace, proposed that a meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General, be convened immediately to take immediate measures to stop the military conflict that had already begun.

    Three days later, on July 22nd, the United States and Britain expressed their agreement to hold a meeting of heads of government within the framework of the Security Council.

    This was a positive attitude towards paving the way for a summit meeting. The Soviet Union immediately agreed to the proposal for a rapid convening of a special meeting of the Security Council with the participation of heads of government, because Mr. Macmillan clearly pointed out that no resolutions would be put forward during this meeting, so as to avoid the outcome of the Security Council's work being to affirm differences by voting, rather than reaching an agreement.

    The correspondence between the heads of government of the Western countries and the Soviet government has been fully published in the Soviet Union and the West, and all literate people can clearly see the truth of the matter. The situation is as follows: As soon as the Soviet Union agreed to the American proposal, Eisenhower and Macmillan hastily abandoned the position they had taken on July 22nd, and suggested that the issue of the Near East situation be discussed by an ordinary meeting of the Security Council, attempting to rely on a mechanical majority to obstruct the adoption of any positive resolutions aimed at ending the military conflict. The views of many far-sighted Western observers were confirmed; they had warned that the positive stance taken by the United States and Britain on July 22nd was merely a tactic aimed at making the Soviet Union reject the proposal for a summit meeting within the framework of the Security Council. Sure enough, when the Soviet Union accepted this proposal, the United States and Britain made a 180-degree turn, exposing their true colors: they were opposed to a summit meeting and opposed to taking immediate measures to extinguish the flames ignited in the Middle East.

    That is the fact of the matter. According to Associated Press reporter Hallettsson, when "a Western diplomat" insisted that the Soviet letter of July 28th "slammed the door shut," then this was clearly the biggest lie in all the Western attempts to distort the Soviet position. To such "responsible Western diplomats," we can only advise them to carefully read what is clearly written in Khrushchev's letter of July 28th. The letter reads: "In view of the current extremely tense situation in the Middle and Near East, the Soviet government still believes that it is necessary to immediately convene a meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States

    时光不待人，必须行动起来
    ——塔斯社观察家评论摘要
    新华社29日讯　塔斯社莫斯科29日讯：塔斯社观察家评论美国对赫鲁晓夫28日致艾森豪威尔信件的反应。
      7月28日白宫声称，在美国总统没有收到赫鲁晓夫在同一天写给艾森豪威尔总统的信件之前，它对这封信暂不作评论。当然这是入情入理和理所当然的。为了对信件作出答复必须事先仔细加以研究。但是有一些“评论员”，他们不是“评论”信件中所写的东西，而是“评论”信件中所没有的东西。例如，据美联社华盛顿记者斯卡利报道，“权威官方人士”说，赫鲁晓夫显然拒绝艾森豪威尔坚持主张在安全理事会范围内举行高级会议的主张。
    合众国际社记者布留斯·曼也把事情说成这样。他援引所谓“联合国外交家”的话说，在赫鲁晓夫总理最近的信中，“显然拒绝在安全理事会范围内举行高级会议的主张”。
    这些“评论员”本末倒置，把一个明白的问题弄得混乱起来。为了说明这一点，我们且来看看事实：还在7月19日，苏联政府考虑到当时的严重局势，考虑到当时要解决战争还是和平的问题，就建议立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏联、美国、英国、法国和印度政府首脑会议，以便立即采取措施来停止已经开始的军事冲突。
    三天之后，即7月22日，美国和英国表示同意在安全理事会范围内召开政府首脑会议。
    这是一种为政府首脑会议开辟道路的积极的态度。苏联立刻同意关于急速召开有政府首脑参加的安全理事会特别会议的建议，因为麦克米伦先生明白指出，在这个会议的过程中将不提出任何决议案，以免使得安全理事会的工作结果是用表决方式把分歧肯定下来，而不是达成协议。
    西方国家政府首脑同苏联政府的来往信件已经全部在苏联和西方公布，所有认得字的人都可以清楚地看到事情的真相。情况是这样的：苏联一同意美国的建议，艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦便匆匆忙忙放弃了他们在7月22日所采取的立场，而建议把近东局势问题交由安全理事会普通会议讨论，他们企图依靠机械多数，阻挠通过旨在结束军事冲突的任何积极决议。许多有远见的西方观察家的看法被证实了，他们曾经提醒说，美英7月22日所采取的积极立场只不过是一种手腕，其目的在于使苏联拒绝在安全理事会范围内召开政府首脑会议的建议。果然，当苏联接受了这个建议的时候，美国和英国便转了一个一百八十度的弯，暴露了他们的真面目，原来他们是反对政府首脑会议的，反对立即采取措施来扑灭在中东燃起的火苗。
    事实就是这样。据美联社记者哈莱尔逊说，当“一个西方外交家”硬说苏联7月28日的信件“砰然关闭了大门”时，那末这显然是西方歪曲苏联立场的一切作法中最大的一次谎言。对这种“负责的西方外交官”，我们只能奉劝他们仔细读一读7月28日赫鲁晓夫信件中明明白白写的内容。信里是这样写的：“苏联政府鉴于中近东地区当前极端紧张的局势，仍旧认为必须立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、美、英、法、印五国政府首脑会议。”
    法国政府首脑主张在欧洲举行这个会议，苏联政府支持这个建议。苏联政府一方面像从前一样不反对在纽约举行会议，另一方面也同意在日内瓦、维也纳、巴黎或全体与会者所同意的任何其它地点举行会议。有一点是很明显的：时光不待人，必须行动起来。全世界现在期待于美国和英国的不是玩弄新的花招和手法，而是明确地回答：它们准备在什么时候参加政府首脑会议。
