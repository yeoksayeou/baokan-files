	Rice Waves Several Zhang Higher (and Another Poem)	Ke Yuan
	Rice paddies planted by the sea,
	South wind blows the rice to gold.
	Only the sound of sickles harvesting,
	No sound of rushing sea waves;
	Everyone says the sea waves are high,
	The rice waves are several zhang higher!
	Reflecting the sea in golden glitter,
	The Dragon Palace jewels dim their light,
	Shrimp soldiers and crab generals flee everywhere,
	Enraging the Old Dragon King to death.
	Clouds in the sky, cluster upon cluster
	Clouds in the sky, cluster upon cluster,
	Rice crops on the ground, slope upon slope,
	Each cloud cluster piled into a mountain,
	Not as much as our commune's rice.

    稻浪比它高几丈（外一首）	柯原
    大海边上种稻田，
    南风吹过稻谷黄。
    只闻收割镰刀声，
    不闻哗哗海水响；
    人人都说海浪高，
    稻浪比它高几丈！
    映得海水金闪闪，
    龙宫珠宝黯无光，
    虾兵蟹将四处逃，
    活活气死老龙王。
    天上云彩朵连朵
    天上云彩朵连朵，
    地上稻禾坡连坡，
    朵朵云彩堆成山，
    没有咱社稻谷多。
