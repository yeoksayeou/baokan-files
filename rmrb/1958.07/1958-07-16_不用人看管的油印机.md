    A welcome piece of news comes from the Wuhan No. 1 Typewriter Repair and Production Cooperative: they have converted a hand-operated stencil duplicator into an electric speed duplicator. From now on, stencil operators can greatly reduce physical labor and improve work efficiency.

    Using the electric speed duplicator is fast, efficient, economical and high-quality. Trial results show that it can stencil about one hundred sheets of paper per minute, increasing efficiency more than five times compared to a general hand-pushed stencil duplicator. The stencil operator only needs to press the button beside the machine, and the roller immediately carries the paper, rotating quickly, and the printed paper is passed out one by one, with good quality. What's even more amazing is that this type of stencil duplicator does not need to be watched. The machine is equipped with an automatic stop device and a bell. The stencil operator dials the pointer to the number of sheets to be stenciled in advance, and when the time comes, the bell will automatically notify. This electric speed duplicator also has an automatic oil supply pipe, and it can print 1,500 sheets of paper continuously without adding ink, while a general hand-pushed stencil duplicator needs to add ink after only a few sheets.

    不用人看管的油印机
    武汉市第一打字机修配生产社传出了一个可喜的消息：他们把手摇油印机改装成电动速印机。从此，油印员可以大大减轻体力劳动，提高工作效率。
    使用电动速印机操作，多快好省。试用结果证明，它每分钟能够油印一百张纸左右，比一般手推油印机提高效率五倍多。油印员只要按动机子旁的电钮，滚筒立刻夹带纸片，飞快地转动，印好的纸在后面一张张地传递出来，质量也很好。更奇妙的是，这种油印机不用人看管。机子上设有自动停止装置和响铃，油印员事先把指针拨到需要油印张数的数字上，到时响铃就自动发出通知。这种电动速印机还有自动上油管，连续印一千五百张纸不用添加油墨，而一般手推油印机只印几张纸就需要加一次油墨。
