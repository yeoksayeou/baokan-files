    Chongqing 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory
    Manufactures Fertilizer and Hollow Bricks
    (By our reporter) The Chongqing 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory saw the emergence of sixteen "satellite" factories in June. These factories completely utilize the waste products left over from the 610 factory's production process as raw materials, and use old machinery and materials to modify equipment. The workers are also transferred from various workshops. In this way, without increasing any capital, equipment, or manpower, they can create wealth worth several million yuan for the country every year.
    These factories were established by the staff of various departments and workshops of the 610 factory. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory, run by the staff of the Power Department, uses coal smoke as raw material. The Power Department's steam boilers burn more than 100 tons of coal every day, and in the past, the coal smoke escaped from the chimneys. Now, the staff have installed water spraying equipment in the flue to spray water, turning the coal smoke and water into ammonium sulfate solution. The solution is then distilled in a closed tower to become white solid nitrogen fertilizer. According to preliminary calculations, this nitrogen fertilizer factory can produce 60,000 kilograms of nitrogen fertilizer per month, creating wealth worth more than 400,000 yuan a year.
    The more than 100 tons of coal slag produced daily by the 610 factory were previously dumped into the river. Now, the staff of the Public Utilities Office have set up a concrete processing factory to utilize all of this coal slag to make coal cinder concrete, which is then pressed into hollow bricks. Using this kind of brick to build houses is not only strong and durable but also provides heat and sound insulation.
    The staff of the spinning mill, weaving mill, and printing and dyeing mill have also respectively established cotton wadding processing factories, absorbent cotton processing factories, oil pressing factories, towel factories, and soap factories.
    In addition, the staff of various workshops and departments have also established wild fiber factories, thread twisting factories, machinery manufacturing factories, wood parts factories, and waste product processing factories, producing many products needed by the factory and the market.

    重庆六一零纺织染厂
    制造肥料和空心砖
    本报讯　重庆610纺织染厂，6月份出现了十六个“卫星”工厂。这些工厂完全利用610厂生产过程中剩下的废物做原料，用废旧机器材料改装设备，生产工人也是由各车间调剂的。这样，他们不用增加什么资金、设备和人力，每年就可以为国家创造几百万元的财富。
    这些工厂是610厂各科室、车间的职工兴办的。原动部职工办的氮肥厂，用煤烟做原料。原动部的蒸汽锅炉每天要烧一百多吨煤，过去煤烟都从烟囱跑掉。现在，职工们在烟道内安上喷水设备喷水，使煤烟和水变成硫酸铵溶液；再将溶液用密闭塔蒸馏，就成了白色固体氮肥。据初步计算，这个氮肥厂每月可以生产六万公斤氮肥，一年可以创造四十多万元财富。
    610厂每天烧一百多吨煤的煤渣，过去都抛到江中。现在公共事业办公室的职工办了一个混凝土加工厂，把这些煤渣全部利用起来做成煤屑混凝土，再压成空心砖。用这种砖修造房屋不但牢固耐用，还能隔热隔音。
    纺纱场、织布场、印染场的职工，也分别兴办棉絮加工厂、药棉加工厂、榨油厂、毛巾厂和肥皂厂等工厂。
    另外，各车间、科室的职工还兴办野生纤维厂、拈线厂、机械制造厂、木件厂、废品加工厂等，生产本厂和市场需要的许多产品。
