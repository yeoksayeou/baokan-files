The Robber's "Lessons of History"
    Xie Fan

    In his reply to Soviet Premier Khrushchev on July 25, U.S. President Eisenhower spoke at length about "guaranteeing" the "peace and security" of the Middle East. It is already a very ludicrous thing for a robber who has committed murder and robbery to talk about peace, but this robber president's citation of a "lesson of history" is even more "meaningful." He said: "The Second World War was caused by a series of direct and indirect acts of aggression against small countries. In March 1939, the then leader of the Soviet Communist Party pointed out that the non-aggressive countries—he mentioned Britain and France—had failed to prevent direct or indirect aggression against small countries, which meant 'condoning war, thereby turning the war into a world war.' This prediction, unfortunately, proved to be correct."

    Eisenhower wants to use this "lesson of history" to whitewash the crimes of the US-British aggression against the Middle East, as if the occupation of Lebanon and Jordan by the US-British imperialists was to "stop" aggression. This is a complete reversal of black and white. In fact, the Soviet Union's accusation was the fact at the time—Hitler's Germany was conspiring to invade small countries in Northeast Europe, while now there is simply no fact of aggression other than the United States and Britain invading Lebanon and Jordan. To stop aggression is to drive the US-British occupation forces out of the Middle East. This "lesson of history" proves exactly that Eisenhower is repeating Hitler's path. The British and French imperialists (including the American imperialists) wanted to condone Hitler's aggression against the small countries of Northeast Europe in an attempt to direct Hitler's spearhead at the Soviet Union and use Hitler's knife to strangle socialist Soviet Union. And Hitler's Germany was also occupying the small countries of Northeast Europe under this banner. There is only one "lesson of history" here, that is, those who occupy the territory of other countries under various banners are the culprits of launching world wars, and those who condone and connive with them are also accomplices.

    Eisenhower's use of this "lesson of history" to cover up the crimes of US-British aggression against the Middle East is like a thief crying "stop thief." It reminds peace-loving people that Eisenhower must not be allowed to repeat Hitler's path, and that he must be resolutely defeated from the moment he lights the torch of war.

    In fact, what Eisenhower should really remember are the end of the robber and the lessons of the robber. Hitler did use various excuses to occupy the territory of many countries, but few of his invading troops were able to return to their own country, and in the end, he himself died in a place that could not see the light of day.

    强盗的“历史的教训”
    谢凡
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在7月25日给苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的复信里，大谈“保障”中东地区的“和平安全”问题。做了杀人越货的强盗，而又侈谈和平，这本身就是一件非常滑稽的事情，但是，这位强盗总统还举出一个“历史的教训”，却更加有“意味”。他说：“第二次世界大战是对小国的一系列直接和间接侵略行为造成的。在1939年3月，当时的苏联共产党领袖指出，非侵略国家——他提到有英国和法国——没有能够制止对小国的直接或间接侵略，意味着‘纵容战争，因此，把这场战争变成一场世界大战。’这种预测不幸证明是正确的。”
    艾森豪威尔想用这个“历史的教训”，来粉饰美英侵略中东的罪行，仿佛美英帝国主义者的占领黎巴嫩和约旦，是为了“制止”侵略。这完全是颠倒黑白，实际上苏联的指责，是当时的事实——希特勒德国在阴谋侵略东北欧小国，而现在除了美国和英国在侵略黎巴嫩和约旦以外，就根本不再存在侵略的事实。要制止侵略，就是把美英占领军驱逐出中东。这个“历史的教训”，恰恰反证了正是艾森豪威尔在重复希特勒的道路。英法帝国主义者（连美帝也在内），所以要纵容希特勒侵略东北欧的小国，是企图把希特勒的矛头指向苏联，借希特勒之刀来扼杀社会主义苏联。而希特勒德国也正是打着这种旗号占领东北欧小国的。这里的“历史的教训”只有一个，就是那些打着各种旗号占领别国国土的人，是发动世界战争的罪魁恶首，而包庇纵容他的人，也是同谋者。
    艾森豪威尔拿这个“历史的教训”，来掩饰美英侵略中东的罪行，正像贼喊捉贼一样，倒是提醒了爱好和平的人民，不能再使艾森豪威尔再重复希特勒的道路，要在他一开始点燃战争火把的时候，就坚决地击败他。
    其实，艾森豪威尔应该真正记取的，是强盗的下场和强盗的教训。希特勒确实是利用各种借口占领了不少国家的国土，但是，他的侵略军却很少能回到自己的国家去，最后连他自己也死在见不得天日的地方。
