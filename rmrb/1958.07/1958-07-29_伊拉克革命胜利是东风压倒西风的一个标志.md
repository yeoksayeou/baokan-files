    The Victory of the Iraqi Revolution is a Sign of the East Wind Prevailing Over the West Wind
    Gong Dafei
    On July 14 this year, the Iraqi people launched a revolution, overthrew imperialism and feudal ruling forces, established their own regime, and achieved a great victory in the national democratic revolution. This victory marks a new upsurge in the Arab national independence movement. It disrupted the imperialist line of aggression and war deployment, and shattered the strongest link in the imperialist colonial rule in the Middle East. This is a matter of great significance in the current international situation, and it is a clear sign of the "East wind prevailing over the West wind."
    Just as the people of the world were cheering the victory of the Iraqi people, the US and British imperialists were panic-stricken and furious at this victory, and brazenly launched armed intervention, attempting to strangle the newly born Iraqi revolutionary regime in its cradle and suppress the rising national independence movement in various Middle Eastern countries. The US and British imperialist military adventures in the Middle East have seriously threatened world peace. Now the people of the world are fighting to stop the war provocations of US and British imperialism and safeguard world peace. This struggle has become the focus of the current international situation.
    The Iraqi revolution is the inevitable result of long-term oppression by imperialism and feudal rule. Although the Iraqi people suffered countless sacrifices and failures in the course of the revolution, when they learned lessons from their failures and organized an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal national united front, they finally achieved victory.
    Iraq is a country with fertile land and rich mineral resources; but it is also one of the countries where people live the hardest. Iraq has as many as 12 million hectares of arable land, but due to feudal rule, only 1.75 million hectares are cultivated. Of the 1.75 million hectares of cultivated land, feudal landlords occupy almost 80 to 90 percent, while an average of thirty out of four million farmers cannot even get one hectare of land. Therefore, the vast majority of farmers are forced to live a medieval slave life. 90% of them are illiterate, and their average life expectancy is only twenty-eight years. In order to rule the peasants, the big landlords can set up private courts, force the peasants to do unpaid labor and pay head tax. A large number of farmers had to flee to cities and foreign countries in order to make a living. From 1945 to 1954, as many as 130,000 people fled to countries along the Persian Gulf. Iraq is a country rich in oil, with reserves of up to 3.35 billion tons, accounting for more than 10% of the total oil reserves in the capitalist world. However, these wealth are all controlled by the Anglo-American imperialist oil companies, who can extract huge profits of 400 to 500 million US dollars every year. However, more than 100,000 Iraqi oil workers have to work as cheap labor for imperialism like cattle and horses. They live in hunger and cold like the peasants. Tariq Muhammad, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party, once said: "The thin and tired faces of Iraqi children and their hungry and cold brothers, sisters and wives are proof of colonialism. We have seen with our own eyes how imperialism has turned Iraq's rich land into a large prison for the people of the whole country."
    The lives of workers and peasants are like this, and the careers of a small number of national industrialists and businessmen have also been severely devastated and hit by the monopoly of foreign companies and banks. They also suffer from the heavy oppression of imperialism and feudal forces, and have no future and way out.
    The Iraqi people are heroic and have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Before the First World War, they waged a long and heroic struggle against the Turkish rulers. After the British imperialist rule in the 1920s, the Iraqi revolution entered a new stage. Workers' strikes and peasants' resistance to taxes rose one after another. However, they were defeated under the joint attack of feudal forces and imperialism. In the 1930s, the Iraqi working class organized its own political party, the Communist Party, and since then the working class has played a stronger role in the national independence movement. In the uprising of 1935-1936, the revolutionaries organized the "Central Committee of the Anti-Imperialist Front", and put forward clear struggle slogans: oppose British imperialism, abolish British military bases, implement free elections, and distribute land to peasants. Under the encouragement of these slogans, the Iraqi people's revolutionary fighting spirit was unprecedentedly high. In October 1936, a group of nationalists and soldiers launched a coup, overthrew the then Yasin al-Hashimi dynasty, and established a nationalist government, which existed until August 1937. Although this government was overthrown, it was also a blow to British colonial rule.
    After the outbreak of the Second World War, in order to further consolidate its rule over Iraq, British imperialism colluded with the feudal dynasty and signed the "Portsmouth Treaty of Alliance." Under the instructions of British imperialism, the feudal dynasty imprisoned a large number of patriots, closed all social organizations, and prohibited all patriotic activities. In order to oppose the Hashemite dynasty's further submission to the treasonous acts of British imperialism, workers and peasants launched a large-scale uprising in 1948 and overthrew the then Nuri al-Said government. In this struggle, the working class fought on the front line and showed unparalleled heroism. However, also due to the lack of strong unified leadership and other reasons, this uprising also failed.
    In the post-war years, the colonial rule of US imperialism rapidly extended to Iraq, and thus the Iraqi people faced new and more arduous struggle tasks. From 1951 to 1954, workers' strikes and peasant armed uprisings followed one after another throughout the country, but none of them succeeded. The revolutionary forces suffered great losses. For example, in the armed uprising in 1952, nearly two thousand patriots were arrested and killed.
    In countless bloody and sacrificial failures, the revolutionary forces gradually gained experience and lessons. From 1954, workers' and peasants' organizations began to strengthen. At the end of 1956, various bourgeois parties, the Communist Party, and non-partisan patriotic democratic people formed a national united front and announced a program of struggle: withdraw from the Baghdad Pact, oppose the Eisenhower Doctrine, unite with Arab nationalism, and adopt an independent foreign policy that is not influenced by imperialism and is based on defending peace and friendly exchanges between countries; internally, realize democratic freedom, release all political prisoners, protect national resources, and develop the national economy. After the formation of the national united front, the organizations of workers and peasants were further developed, and all patriotic people and intellectuals were gradually organized, so the Iraqi national revolution entered a new situation. After careful planning and organization, they finally achieved revolutionary victory on July 14 this year.
    The experience of the Iraqi revolution fully proves that in the national democratic revolution of all colonial or semi-colonial countries, the formation of a national united front by all parties, fully mobilizing the masses, and mastering armed forces are important guarantees for achieving victory.
    The Iraqi people's revolution has won victory in the country where imperialist rule is the most rigorous, and the imperialist consolidated fortress has turned into the front line against imperialism in the blink of an eye. This fact once again proves to the people of the world that the end of colonialism is near. For decades, imperialism has penetrated Iraq not only economically, but also politically and militarily. British imperialism signed the British-Iraqi "Treaty of Alliance," "Special Agreement," "Baghdad Pact," "Common Security Agreement," and so on with the Hashemite dynasty. US imperialism also signed "Military Assistance," "Point Four Program," "Special Agreement," and so on with Iraq. According to these "treaties" and "agreements," imperialism can station troops in Iraq, use Iraqi military bases, Iraqi troops are ruled by British and American officers, and British and American agents can conduct surveillance in various departments. The group of rulers of the Hashemite dynasty, who sought glory by betraying the country under the long-term training of foreign masters, were completely obedient and carried out brutal suppression of the people, playing an ugly role in opposing communism, opposing the people, opposing Arab unity, and opposing national independence. However, the more brutal the imperialist rule is, the more prominent and acute the concentrated contradictions are. Imperialism and feudal forces oppress the people and make it impossible for them to live, so the people have to rise up to fight for survival and freedom; imperialism forces the Iraqi people to split Arab unity, and the people have to rise up to strive for and defend Arab unity; imperialism builds Iraq into a war base and drives the Iraqi people to serve as cannon fodder, and the people have to rise up to oppose war, defend peace, oppose the Baghdad Pact, and oppose the Eisenhower Doctrine. The greater the imperialist pressure, the stronger the people's resistance. Once the balance of power changes, the imperialist feudal forces will be destroyed like sitting on a volcano. The Iraqi revolution proves this truth. Other colonial and semi-colonial countries that are still under imperialist rule today will be no exception. For imperialist countries, the places they consider to be the most "consolidated" and "reliable" under colonial rule are likely to turn into volcanoes in an instant.
    The victory of the Iraqi revolution is a great victory in a series of victories in the Arab people's struggle for independence. In recent years, the national independence struggles of the Middle Eastern people have been surging forward, one wave higher than the other. After the Egyptian people's victory in resisting Anglo-French aggression, the Syrian people's opposition to the armed provocations of US and British imperialism in collusion with Turkey was also victorious. Lebanon, which imperialism considered to be a "reliable friend," is also currently engaged in a heroic armed struggle against the traitorous government and the invading troops of US imperialism. The armed anti-British struggles in Yemen and Oman and the revolutionary struggles of the Jordanian people have never stopped. All these national independence struggles and victories support each other, cooperate with each other, and are closely linked to each other. The great revolutionary victory of the Iraqi people was achieved on the basis of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle, and in the future it will inevitably in turn affect the national movements of other countries towards a new upsurge. National revolutionary forces are launching offensives everywhere, and imperialism is forced to defend everywhere. Today, in the Middle East, the powerful force is the national revolutionary force, not the imperialist force. Today is the era of national liberation, no longer the era of colonialism. "The East wind prevails over the West wind" is the general trend of the world, and the Middle East is of course no exception. The revolutionary victory of the Iraqi people is a clear sign of the East wind prevailing over the West wind.
    The Iraqi revolution is a national democratic revolution led by the bourgeoisie. In the revolutionary uprising, they dealt with the feudal traitors very bravely and resolutely. After the establishment of the new regime, it immediately announced the implementation of an independent foreign policy, implemented the Bandung Conference principles, withdrew from the Baghdad Pact, and united with the Arab national movement. These principles are completely consistent with the positions of Asian and African countries, and it has received warm support from socialist countries and Asian and African countries.
    The first round of the Iraqi people's revolution has achieved a brilliant victory. However, US and British imperialism are still plotting direct armed intervention, the remaining reactionary and traitorous forces still need to be further thoroughly purged, and in the future imperialism will change various tricks, such as threats, inducements, disintegration, subversion, etc., in an attempt to make a comeback. The Iraqi revolutionary regime and people are very clear about these complex struggle tasks.
    We, the Chinese people, feel particularly elated and encouraged by the revolutionary victory of the Iraqi people. Because for nearly a hundred years, the Chinese people and the Iraqi people have both suffered the cruel oppression of imperialism and its agents. Therefore, the Chinese people regard the revolutionary struggle of the Iraqi people as their own struggle, and the victory of the Iraqi people as their own victory.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in his opening speech at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "We must give active support to the national independence and liberation movements of Asian, African and Latin American countries, and to the peace movements and just struggles of all countries in the world." This is the loud voice of the 600 million liberated Chinese people. In the 1950s, the revolutionary movements in any region were not isolated, but were linked to each other. The Iraqi revolution is an integral part of the world's struggle against imperialism. If imperialism dares to launch a military offensive against Iraq, we cannot ignore it. Peace-loving countries all over the world cannot ignore it.
    We believe that the Iraqi people will surely be able to unite more closely in the future, consolidate the national united front, fully mobilize the masses, strengthen unity with Arab countries, strengthen friendly relations with all peace-loving countries in the world, and continue to struggle, moving from victory to new victory.

    伊拉克革命胜利是东风压倒西风的一个标志
    宫达非
    今年7月14日，伊拉克人民发动了革命，推翻了帝国主义和封建统治势力，建立了自己的政权，取得了民族民主革命的伟大胜利。这一胜利标志着阿拉伯民族独立运动达到了一个新的高涨。它打乱了帝国主义的侵略阵线和战争部署，粉碎了帝国主义在中东殖民统治最坚强的环节。这是当前国际形势中一件具有重大意义的事情，这是“东风压倒西风”的一个明显标志。
    正当全世界人民为伊拉克人民的胜利欢呼的时候，美英帝国主义却在这一胜利面前惊慌、恼怒，悍然发动了武装干涉，妄图把刚诞生的伊拉克革命政权扼死在摇篮里，镇压中东各国日益高涨的民族独立运动。美英帝国主义在中东的军事冒险行动，使世界和平受到了严重的威胁。现在全世界人民正在为制止美英帝国主义的战争挑衅，保卫世界和平而进行斗争。这一斗争已成为当前国际局势的焦点。
    伊拉克革命是帝国主义和封建统治长期压迫的必然结果。伊拉克人民在革命过程中虽然遭受了无数次牺牲和失败，但是当他们从失败中吸取了教训、组织了反帝反封建的民族统一战线以后，就终于得到了胜利。
    伊拉克是一个土地肥沃、矿产丰富的国家；但是也是人民生活最苦的一个国家。伊拉克全国可耕地达一千二百万公顷之多，由于封建统治，已耕地只有一百七十五万公顷。在一百七十五万公顷已耕地中，封建地主差不多占去了百分之八、九十，而四百万农民平均三十人还得不到一公顷土地。因此广大农民不得不被迫过着中世纪奴隶的生活。他们90％是文盲，平均寿命仅达二十八岁。大地主们为了对农民进行统治，可以私设公堂，强迫农民作无偿的劳动和缴纳人头税，大批农民为了谋求生路，不得不向城市和国外逃亡。从1945年到1954年逃亡到波斯湾沿岸国家的达十三万人之多。伊拉克是富产石油的国家，蕴藏量高达三十三亿五千万吨，占资本主义世界石油总藏量的10％以上。但是这些财富全部被英美帝国主义的石油公司所控制，他们每年可以榨去四亿到五亿美元的巨额利润。而伊拉克十多万石油工人却不得不像牛马一样给帝国主义作廉价的劳动。他们也和农民一样过着饥寒交迫的生活。伊拉克共产党中央政治局委员塔里克·穆罕默德曾这样说：“伊拉克孩子们和饥寒交迫的兄弟、姊妹及妻子的瘦弱和疲惫的面孔，就是殖民主义的罪证。我们亲眼看到帝国主义把伊拉克富饶的土地变成囚禁全国人民的一座大监狱。”
    工人农民的生活是如此，而少数的民族工商业者由于外国公司银行的垄断，他们的事业也受到严重的摧残和打击。他们同样遭受着帝国主义和封建势力的重重压迫，没有前途和出路。
    伊拉克人民是英勇的，他们具有光荣的革命传统。在第一次世界大战前，他们曾对土耳其统治者进行了长期英勇的斗争。二十年代，英帝国主义统治以后，伊拉克革命进入了一个新的阶段。工人罢工、农民抗税彼伏此起。但是在封建势力和帝国主义联合夹击下，都遭到了失败。三十年代伊拉克工人阶级组织了自己的政党——共产党，从此工人阶级在民族独立运动中起着更坚强的作用。在1935—1936年起义中，革命者组织了“反帝战线中央委员会”，提出了明确的斗争口号：反对英帝国主义，取消英国军事基地，实行自由选举，把土地分给农民。在这些口号鼓舞下，伊拉克人民的革命斗志空前高涨。1936年10月一批民族主义者和军人发动政变，推翻了当时的亚辛·阿里·哈希姆王朝，并建立了民族主义政府，一直存在到1937年8月间。虽然这个政府被推翻了，但对于英国的殖民统治也是一个打击。
    第二次世界大战爆发后，英帝国主义为进一步巩固对伊拉克的统治，串同封建王朝签订了“朴茨茅斯同盟条约”。在英帝国主义指使下，封建王朝把大批爱国人士关进了监牢，封闭了一切社团，禁止一切爱国活动。为反对哈希姆王朝进一步投靠英帝国主义的卖国行为，1948年工人农民又发动了大规模起义，推翻了当时的努里·赛义德政府。在这次斗争中，工人阶级战斗在最前线，表现了无比的英勇。但是同样由于缺乏坚强的统一领导等原因，这次起义也失败了。
    在战后的年代里，美帝国主义的殖民统治迅速地伸向了伊拉克，因而伊拉克人民面前又增加了新的更艰巨的斗争任务。从1951年到1954年之间，工人罢工、农民武装起义在全国各地前仆后继，但都未能得到成功。革命力量遭受了很大的损失。例如1952年的武装起义中，差不多有两千名爱国人士被逮捕和遭到杀害。
    在无数次流血牺牲的失败中，革命力量逐渐得到了经验教训。从1954年起，工人和农民的组织开始加强起来。1956年底各资产阶级党派、共产党及无党派爱国民主人士组成了民族统一战线，宣布了斗争纲领：退出巴格达条约，反对艾森豪威尔主义，与阿拉伯民族主义团结一致，采取不受帝国主义影响的、以保卫和平和各国友好来往为基础的独立的外交政策；对内实现民主自由，释放一切政治犯，保卫国家资源，发展国民经济。民族统一战线形成后，工人农民的组织有了进一步的发展，一切爱国人士和知识分子也逐渐地组织起来，因而伊拉克的民族革命就进入了一个新的局面。他们经过周密计划和组织后，终于在今年7月14日，取得革命胜利。
    伊拉克革命的经验充分证明了：在一切殖民地或半殖民地的民族民主革命中，各党派组成民族统一战线，充分发动群众，掌握武装力量，对取得胜利是一个多么重要的保证。
    伊拉克人民的革命在帝国主义统治最严密的国家里取得了胜利，帝国主义的巩固堡垒转眼之间就变成了反对帝国主义的前线，这一事实在全世界人民面前又一次证明殖民主义的末日已经临近。几十年来帝国主义不仅在经济上，而且在政治、军事各方面无孔不入地严密地统治着伊拉克。英帝国主义同哈希姆王朝签订了英伊“同盟条约”、“特别协定”、“巴格达条约”、“共同安全协定”等等。美帝国主义也同伊拉克签订了“军事援助”、“第四点计划”、“特别协定”等等。根据这些“条约”“协定”，帝国主义可以在伊拉克驻扎军队，可以使用伊拉克军事基地，伊拉克的军队由英、美军官来统治，英美的特务可以在各部门中进行监视。而哈希姆王朝一伙卖国求荣的统治者，在外国主子的长期驯养下，也完全唯命是从，对人民施行残暴的镇压，充当着反共反人民、反阿拉伯团结、反民族独立的丑恶角色。但是帝国主义统治愈凶残，那里集中的矛盾就愈突出、愈尖锐。帝国主义和封建势力压迫人民不能生活，人民就不得不起来争生存，争自由；帝国主义强迫伊拉克人民分裂阿拉伯的团结，人民就要起来争取和保卫阿拉伯的团结；帝国主义把伊拉克建成战争基地，驱使伊拉克人民充当炮灰，人民就不得不起来反对战争、保卫和平、反对巴格达条约、反对艾森豪威尔主义。帝国主义的压力愈大，人民的反抗就愈强。一旦力量对比发生变化，帝国主义封建势力就像坐在火山上一样遭到毁灭。伊拉克革命所证明的就是这样一条真理。其他现在仍处于帝国主义统治之下的殖民地、半殖民地国家也不会例外。对于帝国主义国家来说，它们认为殖民统治最“巩固”、最“可靠”的地方，都有可能顷刻之间变成火山。
    伊拉克革命的胜利是阿拉伯人民独立斗争一系列胜利中的一个伟大胜利。近几年来中东人民的民族独立斗争是前浪推后浪，一个高一个。埃及人民反抗英法侵略胜利后，叙利亚人民反对美英帝国主义勾结土耳其的武装挑衅又得到了胜利，帝国主义认为是“可靠朋友”的黎巴嫩，那里的人民目前也正在和卖国政府以及美帝国主义的侵略军队进行着英勇的武装斗争，也门和阿曼的武装反英斗争和约旦人民的革命斗争也一直未曾停止。所有这些民族独立斗争和胜利，彼此都是互相支援、互相策应、互相密切联结着的。伊拉克人民的伟大革命胜利，是在阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的基础上获得的，今后它必然也会反过来影响其他国家民族运动走向新的高涨。民族革命力量处处展开进攻，帝国主义就被迫到处防守。今天，在中东地区，强大的是民族革命力量，而不是帝国主义的力量。今天是民族解放的时代，不再是殖民主义的时代了。“东风压倒西风”是全世界的大势，中东地区当然也是如此。伊拉克人民的革命胜利，就是东风压倒西风的一个显明标志。
    伊拉克革命，是资产阶级领导的民族民主革命。在革命起义中他们对封建卖国贼们处理得非常勇敢和坚决。新政权成立后，立即宣布实行独立的外交政策，执行万隆会议原则，退出巴格达条约，同阿拉伯民族运动团结一致。这些原则和亚非国家的立场完全一致，它得到社会主义国家和亚非国家热烈的支持。
    伊拉克人民革命第一个回合已经取得了光辉的胜利。但是美英帝国主义还在阴谋进行直接武装干涉，残存的反动卖国势力还需进一步彻底肃清，而且今后帝国主义还会改换各种花样，威胁、利诱、分化、颠覆等等，企图卷土重来。对于这些复杂的斗争任务，伊拉克革命政权和人民是看得很清楚的。
    我们中国人民，对伊拉克人民的革命胜利，特别感到欢欣鼓舞。因为近百年来中国人民和伊拉克人民同样都受着帝国主义和其代理人的残酷压迫。所以中国人民把伊拉克人民的革命斗争，看成是自己的斗争，把伊拉克人民的胜利也看成是自己的胜利。
    毛泽东同志在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会开幕词中这样说过：“亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族独立解放运动，以及世界上一切国家的和平运动和正义斗争，我们都必须给以积极的支持。”这是解放了的六亿中国人民的宏亮声音。二十世纪五十年代，任何地区的革命运动都不是孤立的，而是互相连结着的。伊拉克的革命，是全世界反对帝国主义斗争中的一个组成部分，如果帝国主义敢于向伊拉克实行军事进攻，我们是不能置之不理的。全世界爱好和平的国家是不能置之不理的。
    我们相信，伊拉克人民今后必然能够更加团结，巩固民族统一战线，充分发动群众，加强同阿拉伯国家的团结，加强同世界一切爱好和平国家的友好关系，继续奋斗，从胜利走向新的胜利。
