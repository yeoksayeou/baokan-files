    Kunming Manufactures China's First Most Precise Machine Tool
    Following the successful manufacture of a high-precision gear grinding machine by the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant at the beginning of this year, the Kunming Machine Tool Plant successfully trial-produced China's first and most precise machine tool – the Model 2430 inductive coordinate boring machine – on the 21st. The birth of these two types of machine tools marks that China's machine tool manufacturing technology has entered the world's most advanced ranks.
    The coordinate boring machine manufactured by the Kunming Machine Tool Plant is one of the indispensable and important equipment in the tool workshops of modern machine manufacturing plants and precision machine manufacturing plants. It can process precision drilling molds, fixtures, and holes on parts, etc., and the accuracy of the processed objects can reach five microns (one micron equals one-thousandth of a millimeter).
    On the 21st, the persons in charge of the Party committee, administration, and technical departments of the Kunming Machine Tool Plant, entrusted by the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, conducted the final inspection and appraisal of this boring machine, proving that the accuracy of all components met the standards.

    昆明制成我国第一台最精密的机床
    继上海机床厂在今年年初制造成功高精度齿轮磨床之后，昆明机床厂在21日又试制成功我国第一台最精密的机床——二四三○型电感应座标镗床。这两种机床的诞生，标志着我国机床制造的技术已进入世界最先进的行列。
    昆明机床厂制造的这台座标镗床，是现代化机器制造厂的工具车间和精密机器制造厂所不可缺少的重要设备之一。它可以加工机器上的精密钻模、夹具、零件上的孔等等，加工物的精度可以达到五个公微（一个公微等于千分之一公厘）。
    21日，昆明机床厂的党委、行政和技术部门的负责人，受第一机械工业部的委托，对这台镗床进行了最后的检验和鉴定，证明所有各个部件的精度都合标准。　（据新华社讯）
