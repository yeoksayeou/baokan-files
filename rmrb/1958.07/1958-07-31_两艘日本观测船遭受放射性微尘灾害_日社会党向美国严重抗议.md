Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: The International Bureau of the Japanese Socialist Party, at a meeting held today, decided to lodge a strong protest with the United States regarding the radioactive fallout disaster suffered by the Japanese observation ships "Takuyo" and "Satsuma" in the Pacific Ocean due to American hydrogen bomb tests.

The meeting decided to once again demand that the United States government immediately cease nuclear testing and compensate the victims for their losses. The meeting also decided to investigate the extent of the damage suffered by the "Takuyo" and "Satsuma," and prepare to present this incident to the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, scheduled to be held in Tokyo in August.

Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama stated on the 28th during a session of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, in response to questioning from a Socialist Party member, that after clarifying the extent of the damage suffered by the two ships, he would lodge a strong protest with the United States and be prepared to demand corresponding compensation from the United States based on the extent of the damage.

As previously reported, the Japanese ships "Takuyo" and "Satsuma," engaged in oceanographic observations in the sea near the equator on July 14th, suffered radioactive fallout, and it has been determined that thirty-seven crew members are suffering from leukopenia, a life-threatening condition.
