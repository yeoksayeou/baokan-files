Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 23rd. Workers and peasants in Anhui Province, while angrily protesting the US-British imperialist armed aggression, are actively increasing production to support the Middle Eastern people in their fight against the aggressors.

On the construction site of the new blast furnace at the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, workers are determined to complete more than ten large, medium, and small blast furnaces ahead of schedule and produce iron as soon as possible. The workers proposed: "Time is iron, sweat is steel. Produce more steel and iron to strike the aggressive wolves!" Workers of the cork brick production team at the Hefei Cork Factory have decided to rapidly improve the quality of cork bricks and surpass the level of similar British products ahead of schedule to denounce the crimes of US-British imperialism in the Middle East. After a rally to protest the crimes of US-British imperialism in the Middle East, all the employees of the Quanjiao County Machinery Factory immediately posted many big-character posters, expressing their support for the just struggle of the Middle Eastern people with practical actions. The steel ball bearing workshop of this factory has been put into production overnight.

Many agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have held rallies and demonstrations to protest the aggression of US-British imperialism. Wang Yunting, head of the Jinbu No. 2 Cooperative in Maozhuang Township, Xiao County, said: "The US imperialism was badly beaten by us in Korea, but it is still not reconciled. We must take practical actions to strike these aggressors!" He is leading the cooperative members in field management and fertilizer accumulation to strive for a bumper harvest. More than 1,000 agricultural cooperative members in Gupei Township, Jiashan County, held a demonstration in the scorching sun on the 20th, lasting until 3:00 PM. After the parade, they immediately rushed to the fields to produce, expressing their determination to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule and strike the aggressors with practical actions.

Currently, factories and agricultural cooperatives throughout Anhui Province are continuing to hold rallies to support the just struggle of the Middle Eastern people against aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd. In more than eighty small and medium-sized cities and towns in Shaanxi Province, including Yulin, Yan'an, Xianyang, Baoji, Hanzhong, and Ankang, more than five million people have held rallies and demonstrations in recent days to support the just struggle of the Arab people.

After hearing the news of the armed intervention of the Arab countries by the US-British aggressors, cadres and the masses in the Shangluo Special District and Shang County were filled with righteous indignation, and in one night wrote more than 10,000 protest letters, leaflets, and cartoons, which were plastered on the walls of various streets. On the 18th, Lantian County held a broadcast rally attended by 120,000 people, and more than 1,600 protest letters were received at the meeting. At a protest rally held by more than 20,000 people in Tongchuan City, coal miners and drilling workers unanimously stated that Chinese workers vowed to be the backing of Arab workers.

In the Guanzhong area, more than 10,000 agricultural cooperatives held protest rallies. More than 5,000 farmers in Mizi Township, Fuping County, held a rally in the rain and launched a signature campaign against war and for the defense of peace. That night, 5,024 people signed their names, demanding that the US-British aggressor troops immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan. More than 7,800 migrant workers who are working hard to build canals in Wugong County on the Weibei Plateau also unanimously expressed that they would use greater efforts to build canals and write protest letters to protest the aggression of the US and Britain.

After hearing the news of the US-British imperialist aggression in the Middle East, the coal miners of the first small team of Tongchuan No. 1 Coal Mine unanimously expressed their efforts to increase production and strengthen the power to defend peace. On the 19th, they created the highest record in the entire mine of producing 53 tons of coal in eight hours. After holding a meeting to condemn the crimes of US imperialism, the peasants of Yincun Township in Weinan County deep-plowed more than 100 mu of land that night. Jianzhong Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Xi'an, which has achieved a thousand catties per mu of grain for two consecutive years, proposed a plan of 1 million catties of vegetables per mu on the 17th to protest the US imperialist aggression in Lebanon; on the 19th, when the British aggressors sent troops to Jordan, they immediately raised the target to 1.2 million catties. All the cooperative members launched a crash fertilizer accumulation of more than 100,000 catties in three days. Their slogan is: "Fight hard for a hundred days, pile up fertilizer like a mountain, everyone's enthusiasm breaks through the sky, scaring the imperialists to death!"

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd. The crimes of US-British imperialism in brazenly invading Lebanon and Jordan have angered the vast number of peasants in Liaoning Province who are doing everything possible to fight drought. Since the 18th, millions of peasants in various counties have held rallies and demonstrations, protesting in unison the armed aggression of US-British imperialism in the Middle East and expressing their efforts to increase production and strengthen the power to defend world peace.

More than a dozen counties, including Liaoyang, Yixian, Haicheng, Xinmin, and Kaiyuan, held broadcast rallies. When Liaoyang County held a conference on the 20th, 320,000 people in the county listened to the live broadcast of the conference in 46 branch venues. More than 120,000 people in Yixian held a broadcast conference on the night of July 20, and people used various forms to express their determination to oppose war and defend peace. Some called in long-distance calls, some wrote joint protest letters, and some traveled from afar, one or twenty li away, under the stars and moon to reach the conference venue, determined to speak about their determination at the meeting. Other counties held protest rallies at the township and commune levels. Four hundred and fifty thousand peasants in Zhuanghe County, who are fighting drought day and night, held rallies in the fields from the 18th to the 21st.

After the conference in Xinmin County on the 18th, more than 3,000 commune members in various townships worked hard overnight to fight the drought. They adopted the method of overnight assault and camping on the spot in the fields to fight the drought. In the past two days, farmers in Xiangtang Township, Haicheng County, watered 1,100 mu of drought-stricken land again to ensure the realization of the target of 25,000 catties per mu (equivalent to fifteen 市亩), to strengthen the country's power to defend world peace and support the just struggle of the Arab people.

The veterans of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who had defeated the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield and have now returned to the countryside, still have fresh memories of their hatred for the American aggressors. They all spoke at various gatherings with angry hearts. Ren Yongcheng, a retired soldier who returned to Qingtouzi Township, Zhuanghe County, said at the meeting: "We have defeated the US imperialism, this seemingly strong but essentially weak paper tiger, on the Korean battlefield. The unjust aggressor cannot withstand a single blow from the righteous people. This time it invaded the Middle East again, and the heroic Middle Eastern people will surely beat it black and blue."
