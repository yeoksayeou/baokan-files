East China Institute of Chemical Technology's Young Teachers and Students Determined to Compete with World Experts
Over Eight Hundred Scientific Problems Solved

(Our Dispatch) The East China Institute of Chemical Technology completed the research of 804 scientific topics and the trial production of new products in the second half of June, of which 67 reached or exceeded the most advanced international levels.

Among these more than 800 scientific research achievements are several rare elements and more than 40 of their compounds that are listed on the American imperialist "embargo" list. The anti-oil printing ink, whose formula is strictly kept secret by American imperialism, has been successfully trial-produced by the East China Institute of Chemical Technology. The "Nylon 66" and more than 160 kinds of reactive dyes, phthalocyanine dyes, and cyanine dyes they produced have surpassed those of the United Kingdom. They have also broken the fixed design specifications and made a new design for sulfuric acid workshops that saves 480 tons of steel and more than 1 million yuan in investment.

In these battles to create miracles, young teachers and students took the lead. They said, "What the world has, we can also have; what the world doesn't have, we must also have." Therefore, no difficulties can stop them from advancing in the process of creation and invention. Selenium is one of the valuable rare elements. According to foreign literature, refining it requires special high-quality quartz instruments, which are currently difficult to buy in China. Young lecturer Zhou Zhihao and teaching assistant Gu Naihan used ordinary laboratory instruments for trial production, working day and night for two consecutive weeks. First-year students from the Organic Chemistry Department and second-year students from the Inorganic Chemistry Department also worked in three shifts, distilling pure water day and night to supply it. Finally, selenium, which had never been trial-produced in China before, was extracted, and its yield and purity exceeded those of the United Kingdom. Two years ago, the Dye Intermediates Teaching and Research Group emphasized difficulties under the leadership's thought, and as a result, achieved nothing. This time, under the inspiration of the general line of socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward, young teaching assistant Chen Rongqi and Shi Junying made corresponding modifications to the temperature and raw materials based on their own experience and calculations. In a very short period of time, China's photosensitive film sensitizer was successfully trial-produced for the first time.

In these days, the Party organization is not only the organizer and leader of scientific research in the entire school, but also the inspirer of combat. The person in charge of the Party organization often goes deep into the laboratory to conduct political mobilization and help solve practical problems in work. All administrative units are also mobilized under the slogan of "closely serving scientific research" and plunged into battle. The Teaching Equipment Section works day and night to ensure the supply of research materials. The library extends reading hours and sends urgently needed reference books to the laboratory. The Health Section goes to workshops and laboratories to provide medical treatment and dispense medicines on the spot to save researchers' time for seeing doctors. In this way, all the teachers, students, and staff of the Chemical Engineering Institute have formed an organic whole and created miracles in scientific research.

### 华东化工学院青年师生决心和世界能人比高低  八百多项科学难题迎刃而解

    华东化工学院青年师生决心和世界能人比高低
    八百多项科学难题迎刃而解
    本报讯  华东化工学院在6月下半月完成了八百零四项科学题目的研究和新产品的试制，其中有六十七项达到或者超过了国际上最先进的水平。
    在这八百多项科学研究成果中，有被列在美帝国主义“禁运”单上的稀有元素若干种及其化合物四十多种，美帝国主义对配方严守秘密的抗油印刷药水，华东化工学院试制成功了。他们制成的“尼龙六六”和一百六十多种活性染料、酞青染料和菁染料，已经超过了英国。他们还打破定型设计规范，做出了节省钢铁四百八十吨和投资一百多万元的硫酸车间的新设计。
    在这些创造奇迹的战斗中，年青教师和学生们一马当先。他们说：“世界有的我们也能有，世界上没有的，我们也要有”。因此，在创造发明过程中，什么困难也阻挡不了他们前进。硒是贵重的稀有原素之一，按照外国文献，提炼它必须有特殊的高质石英仪器，这种仪器目前国内很难买到。青年讲师周志浩和助教顾乃汉，就用实验室的普通仪器试制，一连两周，夜以继日地干，有机系一年级和无机系二年级的学生也分三班，日夜蒸馏，供应纯水；终于，我国从未试制过的硒，被提炼出来了，它的产率和纯度都超过了英国。染料中间体教研组，在两年前由于领导思想强调困难，结果毫无成就。这次在社会主义建设总路线和大跃进的鼓舞下，青年助教陈荣圻和石俊英，根据自己的经验和计算，将温度和原料都作了相应的修改，在很短的时间里，我国感光片敏化剂首次试制成功。
    在这些日子里，党的组织不仅是全校科学研究的组织者和领导者，而且是战斗的鼓舞者。党组织的负责人经常深入实验室，进行政治鼓动，帮助解决工作中的实际问题。各行政单位也在“密切为科学研究服务”的口号下，动员起来，投入战斗；教学设备科日夜办公，保证研究物品的供应；图书馆延长阅览时间，并把急需的参考书送到实验室去；保健科下车间和实验室进行医疗，并就地给药，以节省研究人员的看病时间。化工学院的全体师生员工，就是这样结成了一个有机的整体，创造出科学研究上的奇迹。
