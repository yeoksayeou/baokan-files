Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 22nd: Sudanese newspapers on the 22nd demanded that the Sudanese government condemn the US-British armed intervention in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries.

	"Today's News" wrote that the government's recognition of the Republic of Iraq is in line with the common demands of the entire country. However, this step is not complete because it has not yet expressed the government's views on the US-British occupation of Lebanon and Jordan.
	"Al Telegraph" also demanded that the Sudanese government condemn the US-British interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries.

    苏丹报纸要求政府斥责美英侵略
    新华社开罗22日电　苏丹报纸在22日要求苏丹政府斥责美英武装干涉中东国家的内政。
    “今天报”写道，政府承认伊拉克共和国是符合全国的共同要求的。但是，这个步骤不够完全，因为它还没有表明政府对美英占领黎巴嫩和约旦的看法。
      “电讯报”也要求苏丹政府斥责美英干涉中东国家的内政。
