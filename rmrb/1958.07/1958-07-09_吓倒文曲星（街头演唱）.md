    Scaring Away the God of Literature (Street Performance)
    Hu Jiangzi, Shanghai Yanchang Road No. 1 Elementary School
    (Spoken) In the heavens, there is "a" God of Literature; on earth, there are thousands upon thousands of working people. The working people fiercely attack the cultural barrier, scaring away the God of Literature in the heavens. How was the God of Literature scared away? Listen as I sing it clearly from beginning to end.
    (Singing) One day, the God of Literature paid respects to the Heavenly Queen Mother and returned to his Number One Scholar's mansion. He picked up his vermilion brush to review essays, wondering who would be the number one scholar in the mortal realm. Before the brush moved, his head felt dizzy, his eyes blurred and he couldn't distinguish anything. He heard the sound of reading resounding through the lower realm, so different from the sparse sound of reading in previous years. He quickly summoned a servant to ask what was happening. The servant, without waiting for the God of Literature to ask, reported in a sweat: "Oh, God! Don't blame you for finding it difficult to make a decision, even I find it daunting. In the past, there were only a few essays, but today the essays are like a mountain. I mobilized thousands of heavenly soldiers and generals for a crash transport operation, working non-stop. The heavenly library cannot hold them all; the essays have already crowded the entrance to your mansion. The lower realm is united in striving to become scholars, with the same drive as tigers. God, you must make a quick decision, or else your throne as God of Literature will be unstable."
    (Spoken) The God of Literature was furious upon hearing this, and slammed his desk: "Hmph! Bold slave, how dare you report false facts! Back when I, this God, was aiming for high office and wanted to monopolize the top spot, I exhausted every ounce of effort, endured ten years of hardship, underwent three examinations and four trials, suffered all kinds of hardships, and did everything I could to ingratiate myself, enduring all kinds of grievances, before I could ascend to the throne of the God of Literature. It's like a camel passing through the eye of a needle, how easy can it be! How dare these lowly mortals have such wild ideas! You must be exaggerating, reporting false facts. Guards! Take him to the heavenly prison for questioning." The servant, seeing the God of Literature's anger, quickly knelt down and reported: "Please let the God know, I wouldn't dare to exaggerate in the slightest. It's just that the cultural tide of the working people in the lower realm is surging upwards. I saw with my own eyes how the workers, peasants, experts, students, and millions of men and women, from seven-year-old children to the elderly, are all catching up rapidly, determined to start a cultural revolution. Everyone has a book in hand, and the sound of reading is loud and clear. Everyone can read, and every family has the sound of books. There is a county that, within three months, removed the label of illiteracy and became a cultural county. The speed is so fast, and the momentum is so great. In my opinion, it's very different from your ten years of hard study."
    (Singing) The old calendar is not worth looking at, the lower realm is very different now. Everyone is a God of Literature, wanting to compete with the God and see who wins.
    (Spoken) The God of Literature was even more furious upon hearing this: "Hmph! Bold slave, speaking nonsense! Since ancient times, literature has its style, and books have their structure. Reading is like climbing a ladder, one step at a time. How can you disrupt the rules! You slave, you are boosting the morale of others and diminishing my prestige. Guards! Seize him now!" The servant, hearing this, said to himself, "This God of Literature is truly subjective. He must see the facts for himself!" So he kowtowed again and reported: "God, please don't be angry. Whether it is true or false, please go to the mortal realm yourself to see. If there is any falsehood, I am willing to be punished." The God of Literature thought this made sense. Whether it was true or false, he would know once he went to the mortal realm himself. He slammed his desk: "Guards! Prepare to go to the mortal realm!"
    (Singing) The God of Literature descended to the mortal realm, with countless questions in his heart. Thinking back to those years, when I studied hard for ten years, how could I ascend to the heavens in one step! What abilities do the working people have, that they dare to break the millennia-old rules. Could it be that the mortal realm has changed, making the God puzzled. Riding on a cloud as fast as lightning, in the blink of an eye, the mortal realm was before him. He suddenly saw a place with millions of people, the sound of reading resounding through the heavens.
    (Spoken) "What is that place ahead?" The servant reported: "It is a steel factory in the mortal realm." The God of Literature was shocked upon hearing this. He parted the clouds to take a look and was so frightened that he shrank back and trembled all over.
    (Singing) He saw thousands upon thousands of workers, each with a book in hand, reading and writing, the sound of reading soaring to the sky. Everyone's enthusiasm was greater than heaven, and the Number One Scholar's mansion was about to collapse. The colorful clouds floated non-stop, and suddenly bumped into a mountain. A hundred flowers bloomed on the mountain, and millions of people smiled. They were beating drums and gongs, talking, singing, and busy non-stop. The God was so dizzy that he almost fell off the cloud. He quickly turned the cloud around and saw a farm village in front of him. He opened his eyes and was terrified. The hard study of those years had been overturned. He saw from one end of the field to the other, millions of farmers reading books. In the past, schools were like morning stars, but now, schools are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, countless. He turned the cloud to the side and arrived among the city people in the blink of an eye. In the living room, bedroom, and beside the stove, they were reading while working. Reading in the east, writing in the west, being able to read and write was not unusual. He quickly told the servant to turn the cloud around, and returned to the heavenly palace, convinced. He picked up his brush to write a memorial, saying that he, the God of Literature, should abdicate. The cultural revolution in the mortal realm meant that his position was unstable anyway, so he might as well go back to the mortal realm and study.

    吓倒文曲星（街头演唱）
    上海烟厂路第一小学  胡绛子
    （白）天上“有”一个文曲星，地上有千万个劳动人民，劳动人民猛 攻文化大关，吓倒了天上的文曲星。文曲星怎会被吓倒，且听我从头至尾唱分明。
    （唱）那一日，文曲星君朝天后，回到自己状元府门。提起朱笔批文章，谁是下界状元第一名？笔未动，头先昏，眼花撩乱无分寸，只听到，下界书声震天响，和往年，书声寥寥大不同。忙传侍者问分明，到底为了何原因？侍者不待星君传，满头大汗禀分明：星君啊！莫怪你批示难下手，我小的看了也寒心。往常文章三两篇，今天文章如山峰。我动员了天兵天将千百员，突击运输忙不停。天上书库堆不下，文章已挤到状元府门。下界齐心争状元，劲头就像打猛虎。星君火速作主张，再不然，文曲星宝座坐不稳。
    （白）文曲星一听勃然大怒，把公  案一拍：“嘟！大胆奴才，胆敢谎报事实！想当初，本星君为了高登科甲，独占鳌头，费尽九牛二虎之力，十年寒窗，经过三考四试，吃尽千辛万苦，竭尽奉迎，受尽委屈，方能登上文曲星的宝座。真似骆驼穿针孔，谈何容易！何物下界小辈，如此妄想，定是你奴才以小夸大，谎报事实。来呀！拿下去天牢问罪。”侍者见文曲星发怒，连忙跪下回禀：“好叫星君得知，小的哪有这大胆子，胆敢以小夸大，实是下界劳动人民文化浪潮翻腾冲天，小的亲眼看见，下界的工人、农民、专家、学生以及千千万万男男女女，从七岁孩童，到花甲老人，都是猛起直追，要决心闹起文化革命，人手一册，书声朗朗，真是人人都识字，家家有书声。有一个县，三月之内，就摘掉了文盲帽子，成为文化县，速度之快，声势之大，依小的看来，比星君当年寒窗十年之情况大不相同。”
    （唱）过去皇历看不得，如今下界大不同，人人都是文曲星，要和星君比输赢。
    （白）文曲星不听犹可，一听更加冒火：“嘟！大胆奴才，满口胡说，自古文有文风，书有书格，读书犹如登梯，一步一格，岂可打乱规章！你这奴才，长他人志气，灭我的威风。来呀！还不与我拿下！”侍者一听，在一旁说道：“这个文曲星真真 主观，非叫他看看事实不可！”  于是又叩头回禀：“星君不必动怒，是虚是实，请星君亲自下人间一看，若有虚假，小的情愿服罪。”文曲星听禀，觉着也有道理，是虚是实，还是亲自下人间一看，便知分晓。公案一拍：“来呀！打道人间！”
    （唱）文曲星君下人间，心里疑问万万千。想当年，本君寒窗十年，哪能一步登上天！劳动人民有何能，竟敢打破千年常规。难道人间变了样，叫我星君费猜疑。驾起云头快如飞，转眼人间在面前，猛见一处千万人，书声朗朗震动天。
    （白）“前面是什么所在？”侍者回报：“乃是人间一所钢铁厂。”文曲星听说心里大吃一惊，拨开云头一看，吓得将头一缩，满身发抖。
    （唱）只见工人千千万，个个手中把书翻，又是读来又是写，朗朗书声冲霄汉，人人劲头大过天，眼看状元府要冲坍。彩云飘飘飞不停，猛然碰到一座山，山上百花齐怒放，千万人面上开笑颜。敲锣打鼓闹翻天，说说唱唱忙不停。星君看得昏了头，险些翻下云头来。急忙驾云转个弯，一个农庄在眼前。睁眼看，吓破胆，当年的寒窗已推翻，田头看到田那边，千万个农民把书念。往年学府如晨星，如今是，学校如恒河沙数数不完。驾云头，往一边，转眼来到市民间。客堂、内房灶头边，边做边读把书念。东读书，西写字，会读会写不稀奇。忙叫侍者拨云头，死心塌地把天府回，提起笔来写奏本，我这文曲星君该退位，人间文化大革命，反正位置坐不稳，倒不如，再到人间把书读。
