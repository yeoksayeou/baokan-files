Xinhua News Agency, London, 24th. A final decision was made here tonight that the remaining member states of the already collapsed "Baghdad Pact" will hold a meeting in London on the 28th as originally planned. The United States and Britain are planning to take emergency measures in an attempt to salvage the remnants of this so-called "Baghdad Pact" group, without a Baghdad representative, at the meeting.

Macmillan will attend the meeting as the head of the British delegation, and Dulles will attend as the chief observer of the United States. Both Britain and the United States have promised to provide the treaty member states with "millions of pounds."

Iranian Prime Minister Eghbal, Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, and Pakistani Prime Minister Noon will attend the meeting.

The United States, which is still not a formal member of the treaty, is trying its best to transform the treaty into a so-called "Northern Tier Organization" entirely under US control, composed of Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom.

    妄图挽救断了脊骨的巴格达集团
    美英决定召集土、巴和伊朗开会
    据新华社伦敦24日电　今晚这里作出最后决定，已经垮了台的“巴格达条约”的残余成员国将按照原定计划在28日在伦敦举行会议。美国和英国正在打算采取紧急措施，企图在这个会上挽救这个没有巴格达代表参加的所谓“巴格达条约”集团的残余部分。
    麦克米伦将以英国代表团团长的身份参加会议，杜勒斯将以美国首席观察员的身份参加。英美两国都答应要给条约成员国提供“千百万英镑”的款子。
    伊朗首相埃格巴尔、土耳其总理曼德列斯和巴基斯坦总理努恩等将参加这个会议。
    到现在为止仍然不是这个条约正式成员的美国正在极力设法使这个条约改头换面后成为全部在美国控制之下的所谓“北层组织”，由土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦和英国四国组成。
