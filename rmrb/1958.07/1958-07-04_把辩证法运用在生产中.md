(Editor's Note)

    The experiences of Quxi County Committee in Yunnan and Xuanhua County Committee in Hebei in adopting the method of rotating inspections of Category III seedlings embody the spirit of continuous revolution and are a concrete application of materialist dialectics in daily work.

    In the view of Marxists: First, the advanced and the backward always exist. Second, we must actively transform the backward and make it advanced. Third, at a new level, there are new contradictions between the advanced and the backward. Only by constantly overcoming the backward and constantly resolving contradictions can we promote the continuous development and advancement of things, reaching new climaxes from one climax to another.

    The situation of Quxi and Xuanhua counties eliminating Category III seedlings is precisely like this. When Category III seedlings are eliminated, new Category III seedlings are bound to appear under new conditions (with higher quality than before). Continuously organizing the masses to inspect and eliminate Category III seedlings under different conditions effectively promotes current production. Seeing that Category III seedlings are constantly being eliminated, the peasant masses become more and more enthusiastic in production, with more and more people going to work and the progress of weeding and topdressing accelerating. They have greatly increased their confidence in increasing production through this struggle. The experiences of Quxi and Xuanhua prove that dialectics is invincible when applied to all aspects of production practice. It is hoped that comrades in all regions will learn and promote their experiences well.

    把辩证法运用在生产中
    云南曲溪县委和河北宣化县委采用轮番检查三类苗的经验，贯彻了不断革命的精神，是唯物辩证法在日常工作中的具体运用。
    在马克思主义者看来，一，先进和落后是永远存在的。二，必须积极改变落后，使它成为先进。三，在新的水平上，又有新的先进和落后的矛盾，只有不断克服落后，不断解决矛盾，才能推动事物不断发展前进，从一个高潮达到新的高潮。
    曲溪和宣化两县消灭三类苗的情况正是这样。三类苗消灭了，但是，新的条件下（比以前质量较高）的三类苗又必然出现。不断地组织群众来检查和消灭不同条件下的三类苗，就极其有效地推动了当前的生产。农民群众看到三类苗不断被消灭，因而生产劲头越来越大，出工人数越来越多，锄苗追肥进度越来越快。他们从这个斗争中大大增长了增产信心。曲溪和宣化的经验证明，辩证法运用于生产实践各方面是无往而不利的。希望各地同志很好地学习和推广他们的经验。
