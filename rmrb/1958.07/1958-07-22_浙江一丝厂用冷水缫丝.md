Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 20th: It was generally believed in the past that only hot water could relax silkworm cocoons, making them easier to reel. However, a silk reeling factory in Zhejiang recently succeeded in reeling silk with cold water after bold experimentation.

The advantages of cold water silk reeling are: the silk has better cleanliness, with its grade improved by more than one level compared to general hot water silk reeling; reeling waste can be reduced by two jin of dried cocoons per hundred jin of silk; coal consumption can also be greatly reduced. Cold water silk reeling is particularly beneficial to labor protection because the temperature in silk reeling factories is higher than in general textile factories. Cold water silk reeling can lower the workshop temperature by three degrees, and hands are less prone to rot when operating in cold water.

    浙江一丝厂用冷水缫丝
    据新华社杭州20日电  过去一般人认为只有高温热水才能使茧丝舒解，便于抽缫。但是最近被浙江的一个缫丝厂经过大胆试验，用冷水缫丝成功。
    冷水缫丝的好处是：丝质的清洁度好，比一般高温缫丝的品位提高一级以上；缫折每百斤丝可以减少二斤干茧；煤耗也可大大降低。用冷水缫丝对劳动保护特别有益，因为缫丝厂的温度比一般纺织厂高。冷水缫丝可以使车间温度降低三度，双手在冷水中操作也不易腐烂。
