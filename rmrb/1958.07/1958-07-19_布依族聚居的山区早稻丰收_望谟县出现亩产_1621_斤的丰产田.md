Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 18th. The three Bouyei ethnic minority counties in southern Guizhou – Wangmo, Luodian, and Ceheng – traditionally known as backward mountainous areas, are reporting frequent good news about their early rice harvests. This breaks the old notion that rice cannot achieve high yields in ethnic minority areas and impoverished mountainous regions.

As of the 14th, Wangmo County had harvested 64.5 mu, with a total output of 47,607 jin, an average yield of 738 jin per mu. Among them, 1.1 mu of early rice in the Lamo Cooperative achieved an average yield of 1621 jin of dry grain per mu. Luodian County has already harvested over 100 mu of early rice, with most yields exceeding 700 jin per mu. The Shengli Cooperative in Zelou Township, Ceheng County, has harvested early rice yielding 900 jin per mu.

In the past, these three counties were quite backward in production. Generally, no fertilizer was applied to the land, and there was little weeding or topdressing after planting, resulting in extremely low yields. This year's early rice harvest is the result of farmers of all ethnic groups engaging in vigorous technical revolution under the inspiration of the General Line.

    布依族聚居的山区早稻丰收
    望谟县出现亩产1621斤的丰产田
    新华社贵阳18日电　一向被称为落后山区的贵州南部望谟、罗甸、册亨等三个布依族聚居县，早稻丰产捷报频传。打破了那种认为少数民族地区、贫瘠山区水稻不能高产的陈腐观念。
    望谟县到14日止已收割六十四点五亩，总产四万七千六百零七斤，平均亩产七百三十八斤，其中拉磨社一点一亩早稻平均亩产干谷一千六百二十一斤。罗甸县现已收的一百多亩早稻，亩产大部分都在七百斤以上。册亨县者楼乡胜利社已收的早稻亩产九百斤。
    这三个县过去生产相当落后，种地一般不施肥，种后也很少锄草、追肥，产量极低。今年早稻丰收是各族农民在总路线鼓舞下，大搞技术革命的结果。
