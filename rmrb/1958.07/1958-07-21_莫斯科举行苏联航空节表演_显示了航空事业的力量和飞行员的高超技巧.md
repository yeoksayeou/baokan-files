Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th - Today, hundreds of thousands of Muscovites celebrated Aviation Day at Tushino Airport, watching the power of Soviet aviation. Aviation pilots from the Soviet Union and many brotherly countries demonstrated their superb and superior flying skills.

Unlike previous years, this year's performances demonstrating flight techniques and achievements in civil aviation technology and sports aviation technology involved representatives from Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, in addition to Soviet athletes. The flight performance program was very rich, divided into four parts with a total of thirty-eight items, each of which aroused the interest of the audience. The audience saw all types of modern sports aircraft and all civil aviation aircraft here today.

Early in the morning, people walked towards the airport from all directions. The audience formed a large semicircle on the airport. At twelve noon, the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government walked onto the stand, and at this moment, salutes were heard from the opposite side. Helicopters slowly flew up from the airport, adorned with large banners bearing images of Marx and Lenin, "Glory to the Soviet Communist Party," and "Glory to the Soviet People." More than a dozen aircraft flew over the airport, bearing the flags of the Soviet Union and its various republics.

At the start of the performance, gliders performed stunts. Glider athletes from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania constantly somersaulted and rolled at an altitude of more than a thousand meters. Their performances were varied and very exciting. The glider formation performance was particularly captivating. These gliders appeared at an altitude of one thousand meters, forming neat formations, like a flock of silver swallows, continuously rolling, making one hundred and eighty-degree turns, and descending steeply from high altitude. The planes almost approached the ground, but suddenly rose into the air again. In that instant, the audience couldn't help but marvel at the pilots' long training and high flying skills.

The second part was a helicopter performance. Various types of helicopters appeared on the airfield. These aircraft, which normally seemed clumsy and slow, under the highly skilled manipulation of the pilots, suddenly rose and fell like ordinary aircraft, performing various angled skill flights. Their performance was amazing. Next, a special flying machine rose up. At this time, the reporter announced that this flying "table" was a square thing, square on top, with a jet tube below. People had seen this kind of device in some science fiction articles about interstellar flight. This special machine flew twenty-five meters high and stayed there for five or six minutes.

The third part was a jet aircraft performance. Particularly fascinating was the mid-air soccer game. When two "Yak-18" aircraft flew from afar to an altitude of three hundred meters above the airport, eight colored balloons with a diameter of half a meter were released from the ground. The two aircraft circled back and forth over the airport, using their propellers to break the balloons. People saw that these two aircraft were searching for their prey like eagles. When a balloon was found, the aircraft rushed towards it, and each balloon seemed to be swallowed by the aircraft and disappeared.

Three aircraft were piloted by Romanian pilots. After performing many thrilling, dive, sharp turn, and other stunts, suddenly, the engine sound disappeared. The plane slowly descended. It turned out that the driver had turned off the engine, and the plane landed on the grass using its gliding ability. Following this, the latest Soviet civil aviation aircraft appeared. They were the world's largest passenger aircraft "Tu-114," "Tu-104A," "Il-18," "An-10," and "Little Bee" aircraft, which flew in a long line over the airport.

The colorful parachute performance was the final part of the Aviation Day performance. One of the programs was three pilots jumping from the plane at an altitude of two thousand meters. When the athletes left the plane, the audience at the airport only saw three black dots falling, with smoke screens like red silk trailing behind. When they were six hundred meters from the ground, the parachutes opened like three blooming flowers. In another parachute program, Czechoslovak athletes demonstrated superb skills by performing aerial ring gymnastics under a parachute.

The whole program was about to end, and at this time thirty-six aircraft appeared in the distance, lined up in a long queue. When they flew over the airport, hundreds of parachutists appeared in the air, the parachutes were colorful, and the sky was lined with blue skies and white clouds, forming a beautiful picture.

The performance ended, and people left the airport with infinite confidence and with admiration for the great progress of the Soviet aviation industry and for the boldness, dexterity, alertness, and fearless spirit of the Soviet and brotherly countries' flight personnel.

    莫斯科举行苏联航空节表演
    显示了航空事业的力量和飞行员的高超技巧
    新华社莫斯科20日电  今天，数十万莫斯科人在土希诺机场庆祝航空节，观看苏联航空事业的力量。苏联和许多兄弟国家航空飞行员表现了他们的高超优越的飞行技巧。
    和以往几年不同，今年参加表演飞行技术和显示在民航技术方面和体育飞行技术发展方面的成就的，除了苏联运动员之外，还有保加利亚、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克的代表。飞行表演的节目非常丰富，分为四大部分，共有三十八项，每一项都引起观众的兴趣。观众今天在这里看到了一切类型的现代化的体育飞机和一切民航飞机。
    清晨，人们从四面八方走向机场。观众在机场上围成一个大的半圆形。中午十二时，苏联共产党和政府领导人走上看台，这时，对面传来了礼炮声。直升飞机从机场上插着马克思列宁的画像、光荣属于苏联共产党和光荣属于苏联人民等大幅标语冉冉飞了上去。十几架飞机插着苏联和各加盟共和国的国旗在机场上空飞行。
    表演开始时，滑翔机作了特技表演。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚的滑翔机运动员在一千多公尺的高空不断翻筋斗与打滚。他们的表演花样繁多，十分精采。滑翔机编队表演特别引人入胜，这些滑翔机出现在一千公尺的高空，编队整齐，像一队银燕一样，接连翻滚，作一百八十度的回旋，从高空陡然下降。飞机几乎接近地面了，但突然又凌空而起。在这一刹那间，观众不得不惊叹飞行员的久经锻炼和高度的飞行技巧。
    第二部分是直升飞机表演。各式各样的直升飞机出现在飞机场上，这些平常似乎笨拙、缓慢的飞机在飞行员高度技巧的操纵下，像普通飞机一样，突升突降，做着各种角度的技巧飞行。它们的表演令人赞叹不已。接着，一架特殊的飞行机器升起了，这时报告员报告说，这架飞行“桌子”是一种正方形的东西，上面呈正方形，下面是喷气筒。这种装置人们在一些讲星际飞行的科学幻想文章中曾经看到过。这种特殊的机器飞了二十五公尺高，停留了五、六分钟之久。
    第三部分是喷气式飞机表演。其中特别引人入胜的是空中踢足球。当两架“雅克—十八”飞机从远方飞到离机场三百公尺高空时，地面上放出八个直径为半公尺的彩色气球。两架飞机在机场上空来回盘旋，用螺旋桨来击破气球。人们看到，这两架飞机像雄鹰一样寻找猎取对象。当发现气球时，飞机就向气球冲过去，一个个的气球好像被飞机吞进去了，看不见了。
    有三架飞机是罗马尼亚飞行员驾驶的。它们在表演了许多惊险、俯冲、急转等绝技之后，突然，马达声消失了。飞机徐徐下降，原来是驾驶员把发动机关住了，飞机用滑翔的能力降落在草地上。随后出现的是苏联最新式的民航机。它们是世界上最大的客机“图—一一四”，“图—一○四A”、“伊尔—十八”、“安—一○”和“小蜜蜂式”飞机，它们排成一长队飞过机场上空。
    五光十色的跳伞表演是航空节表演的最后一部分。其中一个节目是三个飞行员在二千公尺高处从飞机上跳下，当运动员离开飞机时，机场上的观众只看到三个黑点下坠，后面拖着像红绸一样的烟幕，到距地面六百公尺时，降落伞像三朵鲜花一样开放了。在另一个跳伞节目中，捷克斯洛伐克运动员显示了高超的技术，在空中降落伞下面作了吊环体操表演。
    全部节目快要结束了，这时远方出现了三十六架飞机，它们排成一列长队。当它们飞到机场上空的时候，数百名跳伞员出现在空中，降落伞五彩缤纷，伞后衬着蓝天白云，组成了一幅美丽的图景。
    表演结束了，人们怀着无限信心，带着对苏联航空事业的长足进展、对苏联和兄弟国家的飞行人员的大胆、灵巧、机警、勇敢无畏的精神敬佩的心情，离开了机场。
