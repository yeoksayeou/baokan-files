    Peasants Learning Mandarin
    (This report) Our newspaper reports that members of the 15th team of the Shanlong Cooperative in Daitou Township, Liyang, Jiangsu Province have started a wave of learning Mandarin. This team has a total of 45 households, with 37 young and middle-aged people. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated, and graduates of literacy classes have already entered cultural and technical schools to study. People from other places often come to visit this cooperative, but communication is hindered by language barriers, which hinders the exchange of experiences. Once, when a visiting group from Jiangxi Province came to visit, they had to find someone to "translate," which everyone found very inconvenient. The visiting group made suggestions to the cooperative members, hoping that they could learn Mandarin. The cooperative members accepted this suggestion, as they also deeply felt the need for it. Therefore, they invited an elementary school teacher from Yangxiang Township, Yixing, to teach Hanyu Pinyin and provide guidance. They plan to study for one month to meet the requirements of being able to read, write, and use Hanyu Pinyin letters, and to learn commonly used Mandarin.

    农民学习普通话
    本报讯　江苏省溧阳埭头乡山龙社第十五队社员掀起了学习普通话的热潮。这个队共有四十五户，青壮年三十七人，已基本扫除文盲，扫盲毕业学员并已进入文化技术学校学习。这个社时常有外地去参观的人因为彼此语言不通，妨碍了经验交流。有一次，江西省的参观团前去参观时，还要找人“翻译”，大家感到非常不方便。参观团就向社员提出意见，希望社员能学习普通话。社员接受了这个意见，他们也深感有这种需要，于是就去请宜兴杨巷乡的小学教师来教汉语拼音和进行辅导。他们计划学习一个月达到会念、会写、会用汉语拼音字母的要求，并学会常用的普通话。
