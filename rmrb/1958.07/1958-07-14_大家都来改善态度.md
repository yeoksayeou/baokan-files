    Let's All Improve Our Attitudes
    Wu Zhaoren, Bengbu City Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, Anhui

    Currently, commercial departments, postal and telecommunications departments, buses, hospitals, restaurants... all units that come into contact with the people are carrying out good service campaigns, and the working outlook has been completely renewed, which has been praised by the masses.

    Among us, who are affectionately called "customers," "users," and "patients"... there are still some people who do not respect the labor of others. For example, I personally witnessed someone in a department store picking and choosing and questioning for fifteen minutes, while cursing disrespectfully, and in the end, he left without buying anything, keeping the salesperson busy cleaning up for a long time. A train attendant, fearing that a passenger would miss their stop, kindly woke up a sleeping passenger and politely asked where they were getting off, but the passenger cursed, "Don't you know I'm sleeping? When I get to the place, don't I know to get off the train? Do I need you to ask!"

    Respecting the labor of others is a virtue of socialist new people. I hope that we, who are called "customers, users, patients..." can also, like the employees of commercial, public utility, and service industries, all improve our own attitudes.

    大家都来改善态度
    安徽蚌埠市邮电局　吴昭仁
    目前，全国的商业部门、邮电部门、公共汽车、医院、饭馆子……一切凡是与人民群众接触的单位，都在开展着服务良好运动，工作面貌焕然一新，颇受群众的赞扬。
    在我们这些被亲切称呼为“顾客”“用户”“病员”……的人当中，至今还有一些人不太尊重别人的劳动。比如，我曾亲眼看见有一个人在百货公司里挑这样看那样地盘问了十五分钟，嘴里还不干不净的骂着，结果什么也没买就扬长而去，忙得营业员收拾了半天。一个列车员，怕乘客坐过站，好心好意地推醒一位睡着的旅客，客客气气地问他在哪儿下车，而那位旅客却骂道，“你不知道我在睡觉吗？到了地方我不知道下车？还要你来问！”
    尊重别人的劳动，是社会主义新人的美德。我希望我们这些被称作“顾客、用户、病员……”的人，也与商业、公用事业、服务性行业的职工们一样，大家都来改善一下自己的态度。
