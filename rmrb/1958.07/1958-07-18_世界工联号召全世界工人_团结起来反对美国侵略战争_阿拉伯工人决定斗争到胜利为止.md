Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th - The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) said today in a message to workers of the world that the landing of US armed forces in Lebanon is a crime against peace and a shameless act of violating the right to self-determination of all peoples.

The message to workers of the world stressed that this new offensive by the imperialists is an open threat to the newly established Republic of Iraq. The WFTU calls on workers all over the world to unite, condemn the new crimes of the US monopoly capitalists and government, and actively support the peoples of Arab countries.

The WFTU also called on all workers to effectively defend the cause of peace and actively participate in the struggle against imperialism.

The message to workers of the world was adopted at the first World Conference of Young Workers Representatives convened by the WFTU here.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 16th - The Arab people consider the entry of US troops into certain areas of the Arab world to be an act of aggression and a threat to peace in the Middle East. This was stated in a telegram sent by the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions to trade unions around the world on the 16th, urging workers to pay attention to the latest developments in the Middle East situation.

The telegram said that this event occurred when the Arab people and workers won victories in Lebanon and Iraq in their struggle against imperialism and its agents, and for independence and freedom. The telegram assured that Arab workers are determined to continue the struggle, even stronger than during the Suez aggression, and at the same time demand that workers all over the world stand with them until world peace is maintained.

    电报说，这件事是阿拉伯人民和工人反对帝国主义及其代理人、进行争取独立和自由的斗争在黎巴嫩和伊拉克取得胜利的时候发生的。电报保证阿拉伯工人决心继续进行比苏伊士遭到侵略期间更加坚强的斗争，同时要求全世界工人同他们站在一边，直到维护住世界的和平。
