Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 6th: Prince Sihanouk told a British "Daily Telegraph" reporter that we maintain our independence and freedom by following the Pancha Shila (Five Principles). He said that our neutral policy is to maintain a balance between the two blocs and to maintain friendly relations with countries belonging to these blocs.

The "Cambodia Current Situation" weekly published this conversation with Prince Sihanouk on the 5th.

The "Daily Telegraph" reporter once asked Sihanouk, saying, "Today, with an increasingly powerful China occupying a major position in Asia, what are the prospects for an independent Cambodia?"

Sihanouk said, "The prospects for Cambodia in the current Asia, in our opinion, are just as good as the prospects for neutral countries in Europe, where the power of the Soviet Union is growing. The prospects are even better if we consider the closer connection between Cambodian and Chinese civilizations."

Sihanouk said, "I do not believe that China will be hostile to Cambodia in the future." He said, "We are convinced that we must live in harmony with China and conduct friendly cooperation with it. Geographical and historical conditions require us to do so." He pointed out that our relationship with China is based on the joint statement of Premier Zhou Enlai and Prince Sihanouk. Sihanouk believes that Cambodia is evolving towards "national socialism," which has nothing in common with Chinese socialism. He said that we draw from China what is beneficial to the progress of the Cambodian people, while adapting it to our own system.

When talking about the issue of the United States maintaining economic and political influence on the Asian continent, Sihanouk said that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization cannot eliminate the suspicions that many Asian countries have about the United States. He believes that the United States should modify the existing policy of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which is still purely military in nature. He said that if the United States changes its attitude towards countries that have not participated in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and provides more economic assistance, then the United States will build a "more effective barrier against communism." He also advocated that the United States provide more assistance to the armies of non-communist countries that have not participated in a "supranational organization" so that the "anti-communist defense" that the United States hopes to establish can be more effectively guaranteed.

Finally, Sihanouk said when talking about the large amount of aid the United States gives to South Vietnam and Thailand, in the eyes of Cambodians, this aid is used to threaten us, not to defend against communism.

### 西哈努克对英“每日电讯报”记者说  柬埔寨遵循五项原则

    西哈努克对英“每日电讯报”记者说
    柬埔寨遵循五项原则
    新华社金边6日电　西哈努克亲王对英国“每日电讯报”记者说，我们遵循潘查希拉（五项原则）维护了我们的独立和自由。他说，我们的中立政策是在两个集团之间保持均衡，并且同属于这些集团的国家保持友好关系。
    “柬埔寨现状”周刊5日刊载了西哈努克亲王的这次谈话。
    “每日电讯报”记者曾经问西哈努克说，今天，日益强大的中国在亚洲占主要地位，独立的柬埔寨的前景如何？
    西哈努克说，处于目前的亚洲的柬埔寨的前景，在我们看来，同处于苏联力量日益增长的欧洲的中立国家的前景同样良好。如果考虑到柬埔寨和中国两国文明之间的联系更为密切，前景就更好了。
    西哈努克说，我并不认为中国在将来会对柬埔寨抱敌视态度。他说，我们深信必须同中国和睦相处，并且同它进行友好的合作。地理和历史条件要求我们这样作。他指出，我们同中国的关系是建立在周恩来总理和西哈努克亲王的联合声明的基础之上的。西哈努克认为，柬埔寨是在向“国家社会主义”演变，这和中国的社会主义没有共同之处。他说我们从中国吸取对柬埔寨人民进步有益的东西，同时使它同我们自己的制度相适应。
    西哈努克在谈到美国在亚洲大陆保持经济和政治影响的问题时说，东南亚条约组织是不能消除许多亚洲国家人民对美国的某些怀疑的。他认为，美国极其应该修改目前仍然纯粹是军事性的东南亚条约组织的现有方针。他说，美国如果改变它对没有参加东南亚条约组织的国家的态度，并且更多地给予经济援助，那么美国就会建立起一道“针对共产主义的更为有效的屏障”。他还主张美国向没有参加一个“超国家组织”的非共产主义国家的军队提供更多的援助，以便使美国所希望建立的“反共防务”能够更有效地得到保证。
    西哈努克最后谈到美国给予南越和泰国等大量援助时说，在柬埔寨人看来，这种援助是用来威胁我们的，而不是用来针对共产主义进行防御的。
