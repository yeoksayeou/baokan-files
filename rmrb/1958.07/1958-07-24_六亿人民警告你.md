　　Six Hundred Million People Warn You
　　Cao Yu
　　Twenty-one million people throughout China are holding unprecedented and magnificent parades and demonstrations day and night. Our six hundred million people have decided to support our Arab brothers, who have stood up, with all our strength. All Chinese men, women, and children are closely watching the development of the Middle East situation. Foreign Minister Chen Yi solemnly warned the day before yesterday: "The Chinese people once again warn the U.S. and British aggressors that if they do not stop their acts of aggression, the six hundred million Chinese people and the peace-loving countries and people of the world will never stand idly by." This is the powerful voice of six hundred million people, and it is our unwavering will.
　　For many years, the Chinese people have risen up, attacked, and defeated imperialism on their own land, and finally stood up strong. On this arduous and complex road, there are two most effective ways to fight imperialism: one is to unite, and the other is to fight to the end. No matter how ferocious imperialism appears on the surface, we have thoroughly understood their little tricks. As long as you keep hitting them with an iron fist, they will tuck their tails and run away. This is especially true of U.S. imperialism. This has become a law, without exception.
　　Recently, among the thousands of anti-U.S. and British aggression posters, there was a picture showing a fist like Mount Tai suddenly emerging from the black soil of Arabia. In front of it, two tiny U.S. and British aggressor soldiers, scared out of their wits, were fleeing with their heads in their hands. This painting attracted me because it spoke the truth about the Arab national movement.
　　Today, U.S. and British imperialists are in an unprecedentedly isolated position, which their weak minds could not have foreseen. After this pair of cronies invaded the Middle East, even the ruling classes of the capitalist world felt that the situation was not good and that they were in imminent danger. The American congressmen representing monopoly capital generally showed a "heavy and panicked" look, and they all felt "an atmosphere of unpredictable future." Even among the British rulers, there were talks of Britain "embarking on an endless road of destruction" in following the United States.
　　A Chinese story tells of a rich man who was so obsessed with money that when he walked down the street, he stared straight at a bright piece of gold in a shop and reached out to grab it, and was immediately caught by everyone. People asked him, "How dare you rob in broad daylight?" He replied, "I only saw the gold, I didn't see anything else."
　　In the eyes of U.S. and British imperialists, there is only their monopoly class's oil hegemony in the Middle East. Like ostriches, they ignore the mighty armed forces of the Soviet Union and the people of the world, and still want to use the outdated and ridiculous "gunboat policy" to conquer the Middle East and the Arab people who have already stood up. This is truly being blinded by greed and not knowing how to advance or retreat. No wonder even the mouthpiece of the reactionary class, the British "Daily Mirror," shouted "blind, blind, blind" about the British troops landing in Jordan. And the reactionary American "New York Post" also said with a mournful face that the American intervention in Lebanon was a bottomless "tragedy."
　　The "tragedy" is going to continue. U.S. and British aggressors are baring their fangs and claws in Turkey, Libya, and the Arab region, gathering troops, preparing to expand their aggression, and insisting on their plan of robbing in broad daylight.
　　But the people's "comedy" has also begun. Can there still be a shred of retreat or compromise towards this group of despicable, cowardly, and insatiable pirates? We will use force to deal with force and force the U.S. and British robbers to get out of the Middle East. The volcano of the Middle East will erupt under the feet of U.S. and British aggressors, and the people's sharp knives will pierce the hearts of the pirates. The torch of the Arab national independence movement will ignite the flames of resistance and uprising of the oppressed people in colonies around the world against the imperialists. This is truly a just fire that is unstoppable and cannot be extinguished.
　　The Chinese people have always loved peace, but we have never been afraid of war. The imperialists, especially the American warmongers, should remember this clearly. Today, world peace has been severely threatened by the arsonists of war. Our six hundred million people are ready at all times, ready to pay everything to eliminate the imperialist aggressors and defend world peace!

　　六亿人民警告你
    曹禺
    全中国两千一百万人夜以继日地举行着历史未有的气壮山河的游行示威。我们六亿人民决定以一切力量支持站起来了的阿拉伯兄弟们。全中国的男女老少密切的注视着中东局势的发展，陈毅外长前天严正的警告：“中国人民再一次警告美英侵略者，如果再不停止侵略行为，六亿中国人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民绝不会袖手旁观。”这就是六亿人民强大的声音，是我们不可动摇的意志。
    多少年来，中国人民在自己的土地上起义、扑击、打跨帝国主义，终于坚强的站起来。在这条艰苦复杂的道路上，对帝国主义的斗争，有两条最有效的办法，一个是团结起来，另一个是战斗到底。无论帝国主义表面上摆出多么凶恶的姿态，他们的那点看家本领，我们是彻底摸透了的。只要你用铁一般的拳头一再打下去，他们就会夹起尾巴逃跑，美帝国主义尤其是如此。这已经成了规律，决无例外。
    在最近，千万幅反美英侵略的招贴画中，有一幅画着：在阿拉伯黑色的土地里，突然涌出一支泰山一般的拳头，前面，两个渺小如苍蝇的美英侵略兵，吓得丧魂失魄，抱头鼠窜。这幅画吸引了我，因为它说出阿拉伯民族运动的真实面貌。
    今天美英帝国主义者处在空前孤立的地位，这是他们的贫弱的头脑料想不到的。这一对狐朋狗友侵略中东以后，连资本主义世界的统治阶级，也感到大势不妙，岌岌可危。代表垄断资本的美国议员们，普遍显出“沉重而恐慌”的神色，他们都感到“一种前途莫测的气氛”。连英国的统治者中，也在讲着为了追随着美国，英国也“踏上没有尽头的毁灭的道路”。
    中国故事里讲一个爱财欲狂的富人，走到街上，直瞪瞪地望着店铺里一块亮晃晃的黄金，伸手就抢，立刻被大家捉住了。人们问他“怎敢这样白昼抢劫呢？”他答道：“我只看见金子，别的甚么也没有看见”。
    在美英帝国主义的眼睛里，只有他们垄断阶级在中东的石油霸权。他们鸵鸟似地不看苏联和世界人民雄壮的武装力量，还想沿用陈腐可笑的“炮舰政策”来征服中东和已经站起来的阿拉伯人民。这真是利令智昏，不知进退。无怪连反动阶级的喉舌英国“每日镜报”，对英军登陆约旦，大嚷着“盲目、盲目、盲目”。而反动的美国“纽约邮报”也哭丧着脸说，美国干涉黎巴嫩真是一场无底的“悲剧”了。
    “悲剧”是要演下去的，美英侵略者正在张牙舞爪在土耳其、利比亚与阿拉伯地带，集结兵力，准备扩大侵略，坚持他们白昼抢劫的计划。
    但人民的“喜剧”却也开始了。对这群卑鄙、怯弱、贪得无厌的海盗们，还能有一丝一毫退让、妥协的道路吗？我们将以强力来对付强力，迫使美英强盗滚出中东去。中东的火山，将在美英侵略者的脚下爆发，人民的尖刀将穿透海盗们的心脏。阿拉伯的民族独立运动的火把，将点起全世界殖民地被压迫的人民对帝国主义者的反抗和起义的怒火，这才真正是一场势不可挡，不可扑灭的正义的大火。
    中国人民从来是热爱和平的，但是我们从来也不怕战争。这一点，帝国主义者特别是美国的战争贩子们应该记得清楚。今天，世界和平已经遭受到战争放火者的严重威胁，我们六亿人民都在时刻准备着，准备为消灭帝国主义侵略者、保卫世界和平付出一切！
