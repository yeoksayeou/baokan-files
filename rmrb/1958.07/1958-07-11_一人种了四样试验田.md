One Person Plants Four Experimental Plots

When you come to the Nongjian (Agricultural Construction) Cooperative in Chengxiang Township, Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, and mention Comrade Wang Qinghan, a cadre sent down from the province, people will say in unison that he is a person with great drive, willing to study, and unafraid of any difficulties.

In his room, agricultural technology books are piled up left and right. He is busy with work during the day, so he takes advantage of rainy days or evenings to read. At the same time, he also visits Deputy Director Zhang Xue of the county farm to learn about the experience of increasing production of ten-thousand-jin sweet potatoes and one-hundred-jin ginned cotton. When he has the opportunity, he often researches with agricultural technicians from the province, county, and township. In particular, he has become close friends with the old farmer Wang Hai. With so much reading, consulting others, and taking old farmers as teachers, although he has only been in the countryside for more than half a year, he has not only learned general farm work, but also understood a lot of agricultural knowledge.

Now, he has planted four experimental plots himself: two mu of cotton, one mu of corn, one fen of peanuts, and two fen of sweet potatoes. In late April, he dug the two fen of sweet potato land about three feet deep with a shovel and applied a total of seven layers of fertilizer. In early May, he planted all the sweet potatoes. The corn experimental field even broke the local old habits. Originally, the cooperative only planted more than 2,000 plants per mu, and there had never been intercropping of late corn in the rows of early corn. However, he planted more than 3,000 early corn plants in this field and intercropped more than 2,000 late corn plants, for a total of more than 6,000 plants. After his diligent weeding and multiple top dressings, the corn seedlings have now grown to more than one person tall (more than five feet), and a bumper harvest is in sight. (Du Zhong)

    一人种了四样试验田
    当你来到江苏省泗阳县城厢乡农建社里，一提起省里下放干部王庆汉同志时，人们都会异口同声地说，他是个干劲大、肯钻研、不怕任何困难的人。
    在他的屋子里，左一本右一本的堆放着农业技术书籍。他白天工作忙，就利用雨天或晚上看。同时他还到县农场去访问副场长张学同志，了解有关万斤山芋、百斤皮棉的增产经验。有机会，他还经常和省里、县里、乡里的农业技术员研究，特别是他和老农王海成了亲密的朋友。在这样多读书、多请教别人、多拜老农为师的情况下，他虽在农村只有半年多时间，不但学会了一般农活，而且懂的了不少农业知识。
    现在，他自己种了四样试验田：二亩棉花，一亩玉米、一分花生、二分山芋。4月下旬，他就把二分山芋地用锹挖了三尺深左右，共施七层肥，在5月上旬就把山芋全部栽下去了。玉米试验田更打破了当地老习惯，原来社里每亩只种二千多棵，从来也没有过在早玉米行子里间作晚玉米。但他却在这块田里种了三千多棵早玉米，又间作二千多棵晚玉米，共六千多棵。经过他勤除草、多追肥，现在玉米苗已长到一人多高（五尺多），丰收在望了。　（杜中）
