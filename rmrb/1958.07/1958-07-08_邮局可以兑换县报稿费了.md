Criticism Response

    After the People's Daily published a suggestion on April 14 regarding the resumption of fee exchange services, local county newspapers and radio stations have also successively written letters reflecting this issue. Our ministry notified all provinces on May 19 that if local county newspapers and radio stations indeed have such a need, the county newspaper, etc., can negotiate with the local Postal and Telecommunications Administration to issue small-denomination fee coupons themselves, entrusting the county's postal and telecommunications institutions to exchange them on their behalf, with the post office charging a certain handling fee. This method has now been implemented in Jiangsu, Hubei, and other provinces. The Zhanyi County newspaper can also negotiate with the county post office to resolve the issue.

    邮局可以兑换县报稿费了
    4月14日人民日报发表关于恢复稿费兑换业务的建议后，最近地县报社和广播站也相继来信反映这一问题。我部已在5月19日通知各省，如当地县报社及广播站确有此项需要，可由县报社等与当地邮电管理局协商，由县报社等部门自行发行小额稿费券，委托县内邮电机构代兑，邮电局收取一定的手续费。现在江苏、湖北等省已实行这种办法，沾益县报社亦可和县邮电局洽商解决。    邮电部邮政总局
