Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The following is an abstract of the letters sent by Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to British Prime Minister Macmillan and French Premier De Gaulle on July 19:

Khrushchev's letter to Macmillan begins: Currently, British and American forces have invaded the territories of the small Arab countries of Jordan and Lebanon. The threat of armed intervention looms over Iraq and other countries in the Arab East that are defending their freedom and independence. At such a moment, I would like to appeal to you—the head of the British government.

The letter condemns Britain's attack on Jordan, stating: You claim that the reason for your military intervention in Jordan is due to the Jordanian King's request to support him in resisting aggression. In fact, you know very well that Jordan is not threatened by anyone, and there is no evidence of any threat.

Britain's military intervention in Jordan is based on the request of a king who is unsupported by the people, violates the will of the people, and is irresponsible. So, the only sufficient reason for British troops to enter Jordan is this, and all of this was done avoiding the United Nations, which only learned of this act of aggression after the fact.

You must be very clear that the painful lessons learned by Britain during its unprovoked attack on Egypt about two years ago have left an extremely deep impression in the heart of every Briton, enough to make them realize the grave consequences for the British people of participating in new military adventures.

The letter states: The Soviet government proposes immediately convening a summit meeting of the Soviet, American, British, French, and Indian governments, with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General, to take all necessary measures to halt the military conflict that has already begun. We also propose convening the meeting on any day and at any time, the sooner the better.

The Soviet government believes that the summit meeting of the Soviet, American, British, French, and Indian governments could also study the issue of halting arms supplies to countries in the Near and Middle East, as the Soviet government has suggested in the past.

We believe that after the summit meeting of the Soviet, American, British, French, and Indian governments has formulated specific proposals for halting the military conflict in the Near and Middle East, these proposals must be submitted to the Security Council, so that this body of the United Nations can study these proposals with the participation of representatives of Arab countries.

Finally, the letter particularly emphasizes that the solution to the conflict in the Near and Middle East—war or peace—now depends on your government, on the British Prime Minister, and on the American President.

The Soviet government hopes that the British government will correctly understand this letter from the Soviet government, hopes that this letter will receive a positive response, and hopes that Britain is prepared to resolutely shift the direction of events from the path of war to the path of peace.

Khrushchev's letter to De Gaulle states: Currently, American and British warships, aircraft, and tanks have invaded the territories of two small Arab countries—Lebanon and Jordan. The threat of armed intervention looms over Iraq and all countries in the Arab East.

The planners of the armed intervention, attempting to paralyze the anxious world opinion, hastily declared that their actions are limited to the borders of Lebanon and Jordan. You are certainly very familiar with certain historical lessons. When Hitler attacked Poland, he also said that his military operations were of a limited nature. But what was the result? He first conquered Poland, then Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and then France. After this, he attacked the Soviet Union, and the war expanded to the whole world. This war ended with the tragic annihilation of the aggressors, but in the course of the war, the countries subjected to Hitler's aggression suffered enormous sacrifices.

These historical lessons should not be forgotten, and we have no right to forget them.

The letter points out: What particularly surprised us is that French officials hastily supported the aggressors and even attempted to conduct military demonstrations along the Lebanese coast.

Finally, the letter states: I believe that the painful experiences gained by France in Algeria and during the unprovoked attack by British, French, and Israeli forces on Egypt have left a very deep impression in the heart of every Frenchman, who understands how serious the consequences of participating in new military adventures are for the French people. Therefore, I express the hope that the French government will actively support the prompt convening of a summit meeting of the Soviet, American, British, French, and Indian governments.

    赫鲁晓夫给麦克米伦和戴高乐的信（摘要）
    据新华社讯  苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫7月19日给英国首相麦克米伦和法国总理戴高乐的信，摘要如下：
    赫鲁晓夫给麦克米伦的信开头说：目前，英国和美国军队已经侵入约旦和黎巴嫩这两个阿拉伯小国的国境，武装干涉的威胁笼罩着伊拉克和保卫自由和独立的阿拉伯东方其他国家，在这样的时刻，我想向您——英国政府的首脑发出呼吁。
    信中谴责英国对约旦的进攻道：你们把对约旦进行军事干涉的原因说成是由于约旦国王的请求以支持他抵抗侵略。其实你们清楚知道，约旦没有受到任何人的威胁，没有任何事实说明有威胁存在。
    英国对约旦的军事干涉所根据的是一个不受人民支持的、违反人民意志的、不负责任的国王的请求。原来英国军队开进约旦的足够的理由只是这样，而这一切又是避开了联合国进行的，联合国只是在事后才得知这种侵略行为。
    您一定非常清楚，约在两年以前，在约旦人民的压力之下，就是在这个国王那里服务的英国军人被赶出了约旦，而现在这位国王又把英国军队请回约旦。可以想像，英国官兵重新在约旦出现会引起居民多大的愤慨。
    我想，英国在无端进攻埃及期间取得的惨痛教训已在每一个英国人的心中留下了极其深刻的印象，足以使他们了解到，参加新的军事冒险勾当对英国人民孕育着何等惨重的后果。
    信中说：苏联政府建议立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏联、美国、英国、法国和印度政府首脑会议，以便立即采取一切措施停止已经开始的军事冲突。我们并建议在任何日子和任何时刻召开会议，越快越好。
    苏联政府认为，苏联、美国、英国、法国和印度政府首脑会议也可以研究停止供应中近东国家武器的问题，像苏联政府过去所建议的那样。
    我们认为，苏联、美国、英国、法国和印度政府首脑会议在拟定停止中近东军事冲突的具体建议后，必须把这种建议提交安全理事会，以便让联合国的这个机构在有阿拉伯国家代表的参加下研究这种建议。
    最后信中特别强调指出，怎样解决中近东地区所发生的冲突——战争还是和平，这一问题的解决现在取决于贵国政府，取决于英国首相以及取决于美国总统。
    苏联政府希望，英国政府正确地理解苏联政府的这封信，希望这封信得到肯定的反应，希望英国准备坚决地把事件的发展方向从战争的道路上转到和平的道路上来。
    赫鲁晓夫给戴高乐信中说：当前美国和英国的军舰、飞机、坦克已经侵入了两个阿拉伯小国——黎巴嫩和约旦的国境。武装干涉的威胁笼罩着伊拉克和所有阿拉伯东方国家。
    武装干涉的策划者企图麻痹惊惶不安的世界舆论，急忙声明说，他们的行动只限于黎巴嫩和约旦的国境。您对某些历史教训当然是非常了解的。希特勒进攻波兰时也说，他的军事行动只限于局部性质。但结果是怎样呢？他首先征服了波兰，然后是丹麦、挪威、荷兰、比利时，然后是法国，在这以后就进攻苏联，于是战争扩大到了全世界。这次战争以侵略者的悲惨复灭而告终，但在战争的过程中，受到希特勒侵略的国家却遭受了巨大的牺牲。
    这些历史教训不应当忘记，我们没有权利忘记这些教训。
    信中指出：尤其使我们惊愕的是法国负责人士匆匆忙忙地支持侵略者，甚至企图在黎巴嫩沿岸进行军事示威。
    最后信中说：我认为，法国在阿尔及利亚和英国、法国和以色列部队对埃及发动无端进攻的时期内所取得的惨痛经验在每一个法国人的心中留下了十分深刻的痕迹，他们懂得，参与新的军事冒险对法国人民包藏着多么严重的后果。因此，我表示希望在迅速召开苏联、美国、英国、法国和印度政府首脑会议上能得到法国政府的积极支持。
