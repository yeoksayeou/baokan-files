Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, July 21st: The "Burma New Light of Rangoon" said in an editorial today that under the current Middle East situation, the proposal made by Soviet Chairman Khrushchev to hold a five-nation summit to discuss measures to prevent the spread of the Middle East war should be implemented immediately. The editorial said that anyone who sincerely hopes to hold a summit should say that now is the most appropriate time to hold such a meeting.

The "Burmese People's Daily" of Rangoon said in an editorial today that the military intervention by the United States and Britain in the Middle East "is doomed to meet the same shameful defeat as it suffered in the Suez Canal issue two years ago." The rise of Arab nationalism against Western interference and conspiracies in Iraq is the primary evidence of the Western world's failure.

The editorial emphasized that the people of Asia and Africa are waging a struggle against colonialism, which is extending its tentacles from Washington, London, and Paris. Facing this enormous danger, the time has come for the people of Asia, Africa, and the Arab world to "either act or sit still and wait for death."

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, July 22nd: The Rangoon "Mirror" newspaper today called on the Burmese government to recognize the Republic of Iraq, as many Bandung Conference countries have already recognized this newly established republic. The newspaper said that Burma, as an independent Asian and African country, should not lag behind on this matter.

The "Mirror" said that the Burmese government should clarify its attitude towards the military actions taken by the United States and Britain in West Asia. Burma should issue a strong protest against military interference in the internal affairs of small Middle Eastern countries.

    军事干涉必遭可耻失败
    缅报呼吁亚非人民以行动制止侵略
    据新华社仰光21日电　“缅甸新光报”今天在社论中说，在目前的中近东形势下，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫所提出的举行五国最高级会议讨论阻止中东战火蔓延的措施的建议应该立即予以实现。社论说，凡是真诚地希望举行最高级会议的人，他就应该说目前是举行这种会议最合适的时刻。
    仰光的“缅甸人报”今天在社论中说，美国和英国对中近东的军事干涉“注定会遭到和两年以前在苏伊士运河问题上所遭到的一样可耻的失败”。阿拉伯民族主义已经起来反对西方对伊拉克的干涉和阴谋，这是西方世界失败的头等证据。
    这篇社论着重指出亚非人民正在进行反对殖民主义的斗争，这种殖民主义正从华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎伸出它的触须。面对着这个巨大的危险，亚洲、非洲和阿拉伯人民“不行动就将坐以待毙”的时候来到了。
    新华社仰光22日电　仰光“镜报”今天要求缅甸政府承认伊拉克共和国，因为许多万隆会议国家已经承认了这个新建立的共和国。这家报纸说，缅甸作为一个独立的亚非国家，不应当在这件事情上落后。
    “镜报”说，缅甸政府应当澄清它对美国和英国在西亚所采取的军事行动的态度。缅甸应当就对中东各小国内政的军事干涉行动提出强硬抗议。
