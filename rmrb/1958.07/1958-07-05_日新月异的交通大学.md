    The Rapidly Changing Jiaotong University
    Jiaotong University is a multi-disciplinary industrial university, and one of the oldest universities in China. In the sixty-two years since its founding, it has trained a total of more than 13,000 industrial construction talents, including more than 5,000 before liberation and more than 7,900 after liberation.
    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, Jiaotong University has carried out a series of reforms, giving the old Jiaotong University a new life, and showing an unprecedented and vigorous development and rapid changes in thought, teaching, and scale. First of all, it has undergone a fundamental change in nature, becoming a socialist multi-disciplinary industrial university. A series of fundamental reforms have been carried out in teaching content, methods, and systems. The number of laboratories has increased five to six times compared to before liberation.
    While continuously carrying out teaching innovation, in order to promote the great development of industrial construction, science and technology, and cultural and educational undertakings in the Northwest, Jiaotong University has been divided into two locations, Xi'an and Shanghai, since the summer of 1957. After the division of Jiaotong University into two locations, there has been great development in terms of professional settings and experimental equipment. At present, the Shanghai part of Jiaotong University has 705 teachers and nearly 5,000 students. There are five departments, one college, and twenty-four majors. In order to meet the needs of the current great leap forward in the steel industry, the Shanghai part of Jiaotong University has newly established a metallurgical college this summer, with majors in iron and steel metallurgy, rare metal smelting, iron and steel pressure processing, mechanical equipment for metallurgical plants, and metallography and heat treatment workshop equipment.
    The Xi'an part of Jiaotong University currently has 1,156 teachers and 6,396 students. There are ten departments and twenty-six majors.
    Since liberation, the development of experimental equipment at Jiaotong University has also been enormous. At present, there are two factories and thirty-two laboratories on campus, and four more laboratories are under active construction. Many of the experimental equipment in these laboratories are relatively advanced and complete, and can undertake various experiments in their respective majors. For example, the ship principle laboratory of the shipbuilding department is currently installing a complete set of equipment from making ship samples to performing various ship performance tests, and will be able to formally conduct various tests from September this year. The Shanghai part of Jiaotong University also has several affiliated factories, which, in addition to completing the design and manufacture of various new products for teaching and scientific research in the school, can also accommodate about 5,000 teachers, students, and staff for work-study programs and labor training. The Xi'an part of Jiaotong University has more than 40 laboratories, with more and newer equipment than the Shanghai part, and a power plant with a generating capacity of about 280 kilowatts, as well as a textile factory, for the experimental, practical, and labor training of all students.
    Under the current situation where the people of the whole country are implementing the general line of socialist construction and all aspects of work are making a great leap forward, Jiaotong University is moving towards the goal of a communist industrial university. (Fang Ke)

    日新月异的交通大学
    交通大学是一所多科性的工业大学，也是我国历史悠久的大学之一，创立六十二年以来，总计培养了一万三千多名工业建设人材，其中解放前五千多人，解放后七千九百多人。
    解放后，交大在党的领导下，进行了一系列的改革，使古老的交通大学获得了新生，在思想上、教学上和规模上出现了前所未有的蓬勃发展日新月异的景象。首先从性质上起了根本的变化，成为社会主义的多科性的工业大学。在教学内容、方法、制度上进行了一系列根本改革。实验室较解放前增加了五、六倍。
    在不断进行教学革新的同时，为了促进西北工业建设及科学技术、文化教育事业的大发展，交通大学自1957年暑假起分设西安上海两地。交通大学分设两地后，在专业设置、实验设备等规模方面均有很大发展。目前交通大学上海部分共有教师七百零五人，学生近五千人。设有五个系、一个学院、二十四个专业。为了适应当前钢铁工业大跃进的需要，今年暑假起交通大学上海部分已新成立了冶金学院，设有钢铁冶金、稀有金属冶炼、钢铁压力加工、冶金厂机械设备、金属学及热处理车间设备专业。
    交通大学的西安部分现有教师一千一百五十六人，学生六千三百九十六人。设有十个系二十六个专业。
    解放以来，交通大学的实验设备方面的发展也是巨大的。目前校内设有两个工厂和三十二个实验室，还有四个实验室正在积极建设中。在这些实验室中有很多实验设备是比较先进和齐全的，可以担负本专业的各种实验。如船舶制造系的船舶原理试验室，目前正在安装从做船样直到做好各种船样性能实验的全套设备，今年9月份起即可正式进行各种试验。交通大学上海部分，还有好几个附属工厂，它们除了完成学校教学和科学研究上各种新产品的设计制造外，还可容纳全校师生员工约五千人进行勤工俭学和劳动锻炼。交通大学西安部分有实验室四十多个，设备比上海部分多而且新，并有一个发电量二百八十瓩左右的发电厂，还有一座纺织厂，供全校同学进行实验、实习和劳动锻炼之用。
    在当前全国人民贯彻社会主义建设总路线，各方面工作大跃进的形势下，交通大学正在向共产主义工业大学的目标迈进。（芳可）
