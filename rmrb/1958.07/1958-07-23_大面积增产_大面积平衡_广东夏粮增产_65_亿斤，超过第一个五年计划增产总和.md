    Large-Area Production Increase, Large-Area Balance
    Guangdong's Summer Grain Production Increased by 6.5 Billion Jin, Exceeding the Total Increase of the First Five-Year Plan

    (Our Correspondent Lin Li reports) With the exception of a few mountainous areas in northern Guangdong, the early rice harvest in Guangdong Province has been completed. According to statistics from the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the 19th, the increase in early-season rice production in Guangdong Province this year is 3.9 billion jin, the increase in miscellaneous grains is 600 million jin, and the increase in spring-harvested crops is 2 billion jin, totaling 6.5 billion jin, an increase of 60% compared to the same period last year, and 1 billion jin more than the total increase in grain production during the First Five-Year Plan period.

    Among these, the grain output of some counties in one season has caught up with the total output of the past two seasons, and some have increased by more than double compared to the same period last year. In particular, the increase in production in the formerly so-called low-yield areas is even greater. To date, there are six counties with more than double the early-season production compared to last year: Xuwen, Huaxian, Sihui, Shixing, Ruyuan, and Nanxiong. There are more than 64,000 mu of high-yield fields with yields exceeding 1,000 jin, distributed throughout the province.

    A major difference between this year's early rice harvest in Guangdong Province and previous years is the large-area balance and large-area increase in production. The grain output in Guangdong has traditionally been high in the eastern half and low in the western half, with a two- to threefold difference between the Chao-Shan Plain and the Leizhou Peninsula, and a large disparity between the Pearl River Delta and the mountainous areas of northern Guangdong. The excessive disparity in regional production was once considered impossible to change. However, the results of this year's Great Leap Forward have proven that this imbalance can be changed and has already been changed. In this year's early-season production, many backward areas have caught up with advanced areas, and many low-yield counties have become high-yield counties. For example, Xuwen County on the Leizhou Peninsula had an average early rice yield of only 218 jin last year, a historically low-yield area. This year, the average yield of the more than 104,000 mu of harvested rice has reached 473 jin, an increase of more than double.

    The large-area balance and large-area increase in production in Guangdong Province this year have played a decisive role in ensuring the province's high production increase; it also has special significance for dispelling superstitions and eliminating the inferiority complexes of some people. In the past, whenever it came to increasing production, some people always emphasized "regional peculiarities" and "regional backwardness," especially in historically low-yield areas, where "special theory" and "backward theory" were particularly active. However, now, all these pessimistic and self-deprecating arguments have been swept away. The unprecedented situation of a bumper harvest has encouraged people to compete for advancement, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced with courage and confidence. Even Hainan Island, which currently has an average annual yield of less than 300 jin, intends to compete with high-yield areas.

    Before the Great Leap Forward, when we gave new technologies and new specifications to the farmers, a considerable number of "old farmers," especially those headed by wealthy middle peasants, did not believe that our new technologies could increase production, and even refused to follow our specifications. The most debated issue was close planting. For example, we advocated 3x3x5, while they advocated 8x7. In cases where disagreements could not be resolved, various localities consciously retained some "opposites," resulting in different specifications. Now, after witnessing the fact of large-scale bumper harvests and increased production, they have begun to change. They say, "The Communist Party can lead production. From now on, I will do whatever the Communist Party says."

    This year's early rice harvest in Guangdong Province has also presented new challenges for rice experts and rice science. Previously, many rice experts believed that if the yield of early rice in Guangdong exceeded 500 jin per mu, it would inevitably lead to lodging. However, the facts in Panyu and other counties have proven that as long as fertilization is reasonable, irrigation and drainage are appropriate, and deep plowing and meticulous cultivation techniques are adopted, lodging can be completely avoided. Many rice experts also have a one-sided understanding of the role of ventilation and sunlight in rice growth. They say that rice without more than eight hours of sunshine will not yield a harvest. However, this year, many areas in Lianshan and other places have seen rice with only three hours of sunshine per day, and it has all grown well with high yields. On the issue of fertilization, they only emphasized the role of nitrogen and did not pay attention to the reasonable proportion of fertilization. A large amount of evidence proves that the current fertilizer is not excessive, but how to use it reasonably.

    The fact that Guangdong Province has had a large-scale bumper harvest of early rice also provides a set of experiences in leading production, and also strengthens people's belief in conquering nature. The struggle to eliminate third-class seedlings and transform backward fields typically demonstrates the power of people and the role of people. Under the battle cry to eliminate third-class seedlings, from members of the prefectural committee to the masses of farmers, worked hard for several days and nights, turning many third-class seedlings into first-class and second-class seedlings. This fact shows that the quality of seedlings and basic construction before sowing are important, but even after the seedlings have grown, it is still possible to turn bad seedlings into good seedlings. The problem is to put in the effort.

    This year's early-season production in Guangdong Province was carried out on the basis of the victory in the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, which began in August of last year; it was also carried out simultaneously with the rectification campaign and the opposition to right-leaning conservatism and localism. Facts have proven that the more thoroughly the struggle is in these issues, the higher the increase in production; the more big-character posters there are, the more active the political atmosphere. Xuwen County's struggle against localism and right-leaning conservatism provides an example in this regard. Conversely, this year's large-scale bumper harvest has further consolidated and developed the victory in the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, the victory in the rectification campaign, and the victory in opposing localism and right-leaning conservatism. Therefore, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China estimates that this year's early-season bumper harvest is a double victory on the ideological front and the grain front, and two major bumper harvests. These two major bumper harvests have created a lively and cheerful new situation in the rural areas of Guangdong Province; they have created a new situation of more vigorous efforts and a larger-scale late-season production.

### 大面积增产  大面积平衡  广东夏粮增产65亿斤，超过第一个五年计划增产总和

    大面积增产  大面积平衡
    广东夏粮增产65亿斤，超过第一个五年计划增产总和
    本报讯  记者林里报道：广东省的早稻除粤北少数山区外，已经收割完了。据中共广东省委19日统计，今年广东省早造的水稻增产量是三十九亿斤，杂粮增产六亿斤，加上春收作物增产的二十亿斤，合计为六十五亿斤，比去年同期增产60％，比第一个五年计划期间粮食增产的总数还多十亿斤。
    在这当中，有些县份的粮食产量，一造赶上了往年两造的总数，有的比去年同一时期增长了一倍以上，特别是过去所说的低产区增产幅度更大。到目前为止，比去年早造增产一倍以上的，有徐闻、花县、四会、始兴、乳源和南雄等六个县，千斤以上的丰产田有六万四千多亩，已遍布全省各地。
    广东省今年早稻丰收和往年大不相同的一点是大面积的平衡和大面积的增产。广东地区的粮食产量，一向是东半部高，西半部低，潮汕平原和雷州半岛的产量相差两三倍，珠江三角洲和粤北山地的悬殊也很大。地区产量的过份悬殊，曾被人们认为是不可能改变的。然而今年大跃进的结果证明，这种不平衡的局面是可以改变的，而且已经改变了。在今年早造生产中，有许许多多的落后区赶上了先进区，有许许多多的低产县成了高产县。像雷州半岛的徐闻县，去年早稻只有二百十八斤的平均产量，是历史性的低产地区。今年已收割的十万四千多亩水稻，平均产量已达四百七十三斤，增产一倍以上。
    广东省今年早造出现的大面积平衡大面积增产，对于保证全省高额增产起了决定性的作用；对于破除迷信，消除某些人的自卑感也具有特殊意义。过去每逢说到增加生产，就总有一些人强调“地区特殊”和“地区落后”，特别是在历来的低产区，“特殊论”和“落后论”尤其活跃。然而现在，所有这些悲观、自卑的论调，全都一扫而光了。空前未有的丰收局面，鼓起了人们争先进、赶先进和超先进的勇气和信心，连现今一年平均产量不到三百斤的海南岛，也打算跟高产地区比个高低。
    大跃进以前，当我们把新技术和新规格交给农民的时候，还有相当一部分“老农”，特别是以富裕中农为首的“老农”，不大相信我们的新技术能够增产，甚而不按照我们的规格办事。争论最多的是密植。比如，我们提倡三乘三乘五，他们主张八乘七。在争执不下的情况下，各地都有意识地保留了一些“对立面”，出现了不同规格的局面。现在，当他们亲眼看到大面积丰收增产的事实以后，开始转变了。他们说“共产党能领导生产，今后共产党怎么说，我就怎么干”。
    广东省今年的早稻丰收，也给水稻专家和水稻科学提出了新的课题。这以前，不少水稻专家认为广东早稻亩产量超过五百斤，就非倒伏不可。然而番禺等县的事实证明，只要施肥合理，排灌适宜，再加上深耕细作等技术措施，倒伏现象是完全可以避免的。不少水稻专家，对于通风和日照在水稻生长中的作用的认识也是片面的。他们说水稻没有八小时以上的日照，就没有收获。可是今年连山等地，出现了不少每天只有三小时日照时间的稻谷，而且全都长得好，产量高。在施肥问题上，他们只强调了氮的作用，而没有注意施肥的合理比例。大量材料证明，当前的肥料不是过多，而是如何合理使用。
    广东省早造大丰收的事实还提供了一套领导生产的经验，也加强了人们对于征服自然的信念。消灭三类禾和改造落后田的斗争，典型地显示了人的力量和人的作用。在消灭三类禾的战斗号召下，从地委委员到农民群众，一连几天几夜的苦战，把许多三类禾变成了一类禾和二类禾。这一事实说明，禾苗好坏，播种前的基本建设是重要的，但在禾苗长成以后，同样可以把坏禾变成好禾，问题是要人的努力。
    广东省今年的早造生产，是在去年8月以来，农村开始两条道路斗争的胜利的基础上进行的；又是同整风整社和反对右倾保守、反对地方主义的斗争同时进行的。事实证明，那里在这些问题上斗争得彻底，那里的增产量就高；那里的大字报多，那里的政治空气就特别活跃。徐闻县反对地方主义，反对右倾保守的斗争，提供了这方面的范例。反过来，今年早造大丰收，又进一步巩固和发展了农村两条道路斗争的胜利，整风整社的胜利和反对地方主义、反对右倾保守的胜利。因此中共广东省委估计，今年早造大丰收的时候，都认为是思想战线和粮食战线上的双重胜利和两大丰收。这两大丰收，就使广东省农村出现了生动活泼、心情舒畅的新局面；就出现了干劲更猛、声势更大的晚造生产的新形势。（附图片）
