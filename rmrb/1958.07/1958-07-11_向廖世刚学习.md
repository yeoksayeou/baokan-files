    Learn from Liao Shigang
    Jiang Zhishui
    Liao Shigang, a young milling machine operator and Communist Party member from the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, is one of the many heroic figures who caught people's attention during the Great Leap Forward. In just forty days, his plan was revised five times, and he completed the Second Five-Year Plan in two months, seven days, and a half. He has become a bright banner among young workers.

    People learn from him, chase after him, and sure enough, some have surpassed him. But how could a true hero be content to stay behind? He created another technological innovation, increasing production efficiency by more than 1,600 times, and once again he caught up to those who had surpassed him! This banner of his has been flying in front of people, encouraging them to move forward. Liao Shigang truly deserves to be called a Communist Party member!

    When I read these news reports, I was deeply moved by his spirit of riding the waves and forging ahead. And when I recently read the news about his illness (June 29, China Youth Daily), it stirred up even greater excitement and deep thought in me. I thought, man, a real man, what a lofty term! How should we treat life so as not to fail this most precious title?

    Not long ago, Liao Shigang was hospitalized due to illness. In the hospital, he saw doctors using hand drills to drill bone marrow for patients, which was time-consuming, laborious, and painful for the patients. He discussed with the doctors the possibility of using electric drills instead, and the results were very good. The doctors even exceptionally invited him to observe an abdominal surgery, and as a result, he proposed manufacturing a semi-mechanized "universal retractor." In fact, he himself had just undergone surgery, but his bedside was already piled high with various science and technology books, drawings, parts, and notebooks... Who would believe that he proposed more than twenty technological improvements while ill, and discussed and implemented more than ten rationalization proposals with his visiting workmates! He is truly a man obsessed with technological revolution, with such vigorous vitality!

    In the torrent of life, he never remains a silent bystander. No matter where, no matter when, and regardless of others' attitudes, he always acts as a Communist Party member, planting red flags everywhere. As long as the Party points it out to him, he fights for the truth fearlessly, with an owner's mentality. This is why he can't find peace even lying in a hospital bed, stirring up a technological revolution in the hospital.

    It would be perfectly normal for a sick person in the hospital not to do these things, but Liao Shigang did. Only those who have completely abandoned selfish and self-interested thoughts and do not care about personal gains and losses can do this. His actions show that only work and the Party's call can occupy his heart in his life. His thoughts are so pure that one cannot see any impurities. He always wants to contribute his strength to the Party's cause, and he simply has no time to consider personal gains or losses, or worry about his health.

    From this, I am reminded that some people are still expressing the view that work is too intense, and there is simply no time for personal activities. People who say this actually resent that the masses are running too fast and the revolutionary situation is pressing, and they are eager to "take it slow." This is the voice of an individualist. Liao Shigang's deeds of engaging in technological revolution while ill are a good remedy for people with this kind of thinking.

    Let us learn from Comrade Liao Shigang!

    向廖世刚学习
    江之水
    重庆建设机床厂青年铣工共产党员廖世刚，是大跃进中为人们所注目的许多英雄人物当中的一个。在短短的四十天里，他的规划改了五次，两个月零七天半就完成了第二个五年计划。他已经成为青年工人当中一面鲜明的旗帜。
    人们学习他，追赶他，果然就有人把他赶过了，然而一个真正的英雄哪里会甘居下游呢，他又创造了一项技术革新，又把生产效率提高了一千六百多倍，于是他又赶到了曾经赶过他的人们的前面去了！他这面旗帜就这样一直在人们面前飘扬着，鼓舞着人们前进。廖世刚真不愧是一个共产党员！
    我在报上读到这些消息的时候，深深地被他这种乘风破浪、奋翼前进的精神所感动，而当我最近读到他病中的消息的时候（6月29日中国青年报）又引起了我更大的激动和深思。我想到，人，真正的人，这是一个多么崇高的字眼！我们该怎样地对待生活才不辜负这最最珍贵的称呼呢？
    不久以前，廖世刚因病住了医院。他在医院里看到医生用手摇钻给病人钻夹骨眼，既费时又费力，病人也痛苦不堪。他就和医生研究试制用电钻来代替，应用起来效果很好。医生又曾破例地请他看了一次给病人作腹部开刀的手术，结果他又提出制造了半机械化的“万能牵开刀”。其实，他自己也刚刚动过手术，但是枕边已经堆满了各种科技书、图纸、零件、练习本……谁相信，他在病中居然提出了二十多项技术改进，并和来探病的工友们研究和实现了十多项合理化建议！真是一个闹技术革命着了迷的人，他有着多么旺盛的生命力啊！
    在生活的激流里，他永远不做一个默默无声的旁观者。无论在什么地方，什么时候，也不管别人的态度如何，他总是以一个共产党员的本分，到处插上红旗，只要是党指点给他的，他就无所顾虑，以主人翁的态度为真理奋斗。这就是他为什么即使躺在病床上也一点儿不能宁静，搅得医院里也闹起技术革命来的原因了。
    人有病住了医院，不做这些事情是无足怪的，然而廖世刚做了。这只有那些完全抛弃了自私自利的思想，不为个人得失计较的人，才能够做出来。他的行动向人说明了，在他的生活里，只有工作和党的号召才能占据他的心。他的思想纯洁得让人看不到一点杂质，他无时无刻不想把力量贡献给党的事业，他根本无暇去考虑个人的得失，或是为自己的身体担忧。
    由此我联想到，目前有些人还透露出这样的论调，他们认为工作太紧张了，简直没有了个人活动的时间。说这样的话的人，实际上是嫌群众跑得太快，革命形势逼人，一心想“慢慢来”，这是个人主义者的心声。廖世刚在病中还闹技术革命的事迹对具有这种思想的人，是一服对症的良药。
    让我们向廖世刚同志学习吧！
