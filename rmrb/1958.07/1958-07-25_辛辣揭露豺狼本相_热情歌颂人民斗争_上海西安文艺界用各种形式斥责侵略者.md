Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 24th: More and more writers, artists, and musicians in Shanghai are participating in demonstrations against the US and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East every day.

A few days ago, more than one hundred writers in Shanghai held a protest meeting against the war provocations of US and British imperialism. The famous writer Ba Jin called on everyone at the meeting to take up their pens and attack the aggressors. These days, writers have published a large number of works in newspapers and periodicals supporting the Arab people's resistance to aggression. Poets have written many poems protesting against US and British aggression, printed them into "poetry leaflets," and personally posted them on the streets and in streetcar and bus carriages.

Shanghai's painters, in the passion of angrily protesting against US and British aggression in the Middle East, have painted more than fifty cartoons and propaganda posters in recent days, some of which have already been posted on the streets. Many traditional Chinese painters have also exceptionally used the techniques of traditional Chinese painting to create huge propaganda posters.

Musicians are using songs to express their anger at US and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East. They have created more than one hundred new songs, taken to the streets to sing them, and also taught the masses to sing out loudly together. Many marching demonstrators sang these songs as they passed the entrance of the Shanghai office of the British Chargé d'Affaires to China. During a street performance, the famous soprano Zhou Bizhen sang "American Wolves Get Out!" The surrounding crowd was excited, and many people raised their arms and shouted: "American Wolves Get Out of the Middle East!"

Playwrights of various opera genres have created many street plays. In People's Square, in the green areas along the Huangpu River, and in the Cao Yang New Village workers' residential area, actors can be seen everywhere braving the scorching sun to perform Peking Opera "Victory Belongs to the Arab People," Yue Opera "Severing the Devil's Claws," and living newspaper plays "Head-on Blow." The emotions of actors and the masses are intertwined, and whenever the performance ends, the masses shout slogans, denouncing the aggressive crimes of US and British imperialism.

The publishing industry is also very active in the demonstration movement against US and British imperialist aggression. Shanghai Culture Publishing House has published a large number of "ballad books," and the editors of New Literature and Art Publishing House translated 70,000 words of poems by Lebanese peace warriors in four days.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 24th: Everyone in Xi'an's literary and art circles is using various literary and artistic forms to attack US and British aggressors and support the just struggle of the people of the Middle East.

Many newly created poems and cartoons are posted on the streets of Xi'an, and many theater troupes are taking to the streets and squares to perform. The old poet Ke Zhongping, who is nearly sixty years old, wrote poems while ill to denounce US and British aggressors. The blind artist Han Qixiang wrote several poems in Braille, issuing the call to "break the legs of the invaders." The painter Shi Lu, who visited Egypt more than a year ago, created several cartoons overnight to support the struggle of the Arab people. More than 130 teachers and students of the Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts have created more than 450 cartoons in recent days, which are scattered on the streets. The street poetry and painting window jointly organized by the Xi'an Branch of the Writers Association and other three literary and art groups has sharp and lively text and strong combativeness, and is warmly welcomed by the audience.

Actors from ten theater troupes, including the Xi'an People's Drama Troupe, Yi Su She, and San Yi She, have created nearly one hundred living newspaper plays and other opera programs in recent days. In addition to performing in theaters, they also perform on the streets. The play "Madman's Ugly State" performed by the Xi'an People's Drama Troupe bitterly exposes and mocks the wolfish nature of the war-mongers in the Pentagon. When this play was performed on the street, the audience repeatedly shouted, "American troops get out of Lebanon!"

    上海西安文艺界用各种形式斥责侵略者
    新华社上海24日电　上海市每天都有更多的作家、艺术家、音乐家们参加反对美、英帝国主义侵略中东的示威运动。
    前几天，上海市的一百多位作家举行了反对美英帝国主义战争挑衅的抗议集会。著名作家巴金在会上号召大家拿起笔来打击侵略者。这几天，作家们在报刊上发表了大量支援阿拉伯人民反抗侵略的作品。诗人们写了许多抗议美英侵略的诗歌，印成“诗传单”，亲自贴到马路上和电车、公共汽车的车厢里。
    上海的画家们在愤怒抗议美英侵略中东的激情下，连日来画了五十多幅漫画和宣传画，有的已经张贴在街头。许多国画家也破例用国画的手法，画了巨幅的宣传画。
    音乐家们用歌唱表达他们对美英帝国主义侵略中东的愤怒。他们创作了一百多首新歌，走上街头演唱，还教给群众一起放声高歌。许多游行示威的群众唱着这些歌走过英国驻中国代办处上海参赞办事处的门口。著名女高音歌唱家周碧珍在一次街头演唱中唱完“美国狼滚出去”时，周围的群众情绪激昂，许多人都举臂高呼：“美国狼滚出中东去！”
    各个剧种的剧作家都创作了许多街头剧。在人民广场、在黄浦江边的绿化地带，在曹杨新村工人住宅区，到处可以看到演员们冒着灼热的阳光，演着京剧“胜利属于阿拉伯人民”，越剧“斩断魔爪”，活报剧“迎头痛击”。演员和群众的情绪交织成一片，每当演出结束时，群众都高呼口号，声讨美英帝国主义的侵略罪行。
    出版界在反对美英帝国主义侵略的示威运动中也非常活跃。上海文化出版社出版了大量的“说唱本”，新文艺出版社的编辑四天内译出了七万字的黎巴嫩和平战士们的诗歌。
    新华社西安24日电　西安文艺界人人动手动口，用多种多样的文艺形式打击美英侵略者，声援中东人民的正义斗争。
    新近创作的许多诗歌漫画张贴在西安街头，许多剧团走向街头和广场演出。年近花甲的老诗人柯仲平，抱病写诗声讨美英侵略者。盲艺人韩起祥用盲文写了几首诗，发出了“打断侵略者的狗腿”的呼声。一年多以前曾到埃及访问过的画家石鲁，连夜创作了几幅漫画，声援阿拉伯人民的斗争。西安美术专科学校一百三十多名师生连日来创作漫画四百五十多幅，散贴在街头。作协西安分会等三个文艺团体合办的街头诗画窗，文字犀利生动，战斗性很强，受到观众的热烈欢迎。
    西安市人民话剧团、易俗社、三意社等十个剧团的演员们，连日来创作了近一百个活报剧等戏曲节目。他们除在剧场表演外，还到街头演出。西安市人民话剧团演出的“狂人丑态”一剧，辛辣地揭露和嘲讽了五角大楼的战争贩子们的豺狼本性。当这个戏在街头演出时，观众连连喊出“美军滚出黎巴嫩！”
