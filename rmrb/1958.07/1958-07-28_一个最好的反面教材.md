    A Best Negative Example
    By The People's Daily Commentator

    The Cairo "Al-Ahram" recently revealed a "classified security situation report" issued by the U.S. State Department to its embassy in Baghdad and published a photocopy of the intelligence. Another unsavory, underhanded trick of the United States has been dragged into the light of day. From the U.S. dispatch of troops to invade Lebanon, it is not difficult for people to see the face of the United States as the most ferocious colonial aggressor. Now that this "classified" document has been revealed, people can see even more clearly the cunning and insidious nature of the United States as an imperialist country. For all those who respect national independence and oppose colonial aggression, this "classified" document is a best negative example.

    The purpose of this "classified" document from the U.S. State Department is to disintegrate the union of Egypt and Syria, to "discredit" the "ideological credibility" of the United Arab Republic, and to "isolate the UAR from other countries in the Arab world." At the same time, it also attempts to sow discord between the UAR and the Soviet Union. To achieve this "main goal," the document explains certain changes in U.S. policy some time ago, such as unfreezing some of the Egyptian funds frozen by the United States, relaxing trade restrictions on the UAR, etc. The document states: If the United States continues to pursue its previous policy toward the UAR, it "can only infuriate the Arabs and drive them into the arms of the Soviets." Therefore, the U.S. policy toward the UAR must be "liberalized to some extent." The U.S. State Department, fearing that its gang of diplomatic officials who are used to stirring up discord would misunderstand, also instructed in the document: "This does not mean a fundamental re-evaluation of our policy. It is a temporary change in tactics made out of necessity."

    What does the United States "need"? What the United States "needs" is the strategic location of the Middle East, its military bases, its oil, and the large profits it reaps from oil, as well as the people there listening obediently to its control, so that they can be enslaved and, when necessary, provide cannon fodder. In a word, what the United States "needs" is unadulterated colonial interests. However, the UAR and Arab nationalism have given the entire Arab nation, yearning to get rid of imperialist shackles and striving for national independence, an example and a hope. Therefore, the UAR and Arab nationalism have become thorns in the side and daggers in the eyes of the United States. In order to disintegrate the UAR, the United States has changed its "tactics" on the surface, while secretly instructing its diplomatic personnel to do their utmost to provoke relations between the UAR and other Arab countries, to "use every opportunity to establish an Iraqi-Jordanian federation," to support this federation to "oppose" the UAR, and to instruct its diplomatic personnel to "relentlessly consolidate" pro-Western forces within the UAR. What does this mean? Isn't this the most despicable and shameless subversive activity?

    However, all of this has failed. Like a thunderclap, the Iraqi-Jordanian federation, which the United States fully supported, collapsed, and the main cornerstone of the imperialist aggression front in the Middle East fell. The United States was so frightened that it did not even have time to dress up and ordered its troops to climb onto the coast of Lebanon. All of a sudden, the faces of robbers and swindlers were exposed.

    Friends cannot be disguised. From the Suez Canal War, the Syrian struggle to safeguard sovereignty and independence, and the current Middle East crisis, the Arab people will easily distinguish who are the real friends and who are the real enemies.

    The U.S. State Department's "classified security situation report" will make all Arab people, as well as the oppressed people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are striving for national independence, further recognize the face of U.S. imperialism, abandon illusions, and actively engage in struggle. This is the only result that imperialists can possibly get from playing with conspiracies and tricks that they think are clever.

    一个最好的反面教材
    本报评论员
    开罗“金字塔报”最近揭露了美国国务院发给驻巴格达大使馆的一份“机密安全情况”，而且刊印了这份情报的影印副本。美国又一件见不得人的鬼蜮勾当被拖到光天化日之下来了。从美国派兵侵占黎巴嫩的行动中，人们已经不难看出美国作为最凶恶的殖民主义侵略者的面目，现在这份“机密”文件又被揭露出来，人们更可以清楚地看到美国作为帝国主义国家的狡诈阴险。对于一切尊重民族独立、反对殖民侵略的人们，这份“机密”文件都是一个最好的反面教材。
    美国国务院的这份“机密”文件，目的是瓦解埃及和叙利亚的联合，使阿拉伯联合共和国的“思想信誉扫地”，“使阿联脱离阿拉伯世界其他国家而孤立”，同时，还企图离间阿联和苏联的关系。为达到这个“主要目标”，这份文件解释了前些时候美国政策的某些改变，如把美国冻结的埃及资金解冻一部分，放宽对阿联的贸易限制等等。文件说：美国继续奉行以往对阿联的政策，“只能使阿拉伯人忿懑，驱使他们投入苏联人的怀抱”。因此，美国对阿联的政策必须“在某种程度上开明化”。美国国务院还生怕它那帮惯作挑拨离间勾当的外交官员发生误解，又在文件里叮咛道：“这并不意味着对我们的政策从根本上重新估价。这是出于必要而作的一种策略上的暂时改变。
    美国所“需要”的是什么呢？美国所“需要”的是中东地区的战略位置，是那里的军事基地，那里的石油和从石油中捞取的大批利润，以及要那里的人民服服贴贴听从它的控制，以便既可供它奴役，必要时又可为它提供炮灰。一句话，美国所“需要”的就是不折不扣的殖民主义利益。而阿联和阿拉伯民族主义，却使热望摆脱帝国主义羁绊、争取民族独立的整个阿拉伯民族有了一个榜样，一个希望。因此阿联和阿拉伯民族主义就成了美国的眼中钉，肉中刺。为了瓦解阿联，美国在表面上改变了“策略”，而背地里却指使它的外交人员极力挑拨阿联和其他阿拉伯国家的关系，“利用每一机会来建立一个伊拉克—约旦联邦”，支持这个联邦来“反对”阿联，并且指使它的外交人员“必须不懈地巩固”阿联国内的亲西方势力。这是什么意思呢？难道这不是最为卑鄙无耻的颠复活动吗？
    然而这一切也都统统失败了。霹雳一声，美国所全力支持的伊拉克—约旦联邦垮台了，帝国主义在中东的侵略阵线的主要基石陷落了。美国被吓得如此惊慌，甚至来不及打扮一下，就叫它的军队爬上了黎巴嫩海岸。一下子，强盗和骗子的面孔就都暴露出来了。
    朋友是不能伪装的。阿拉伯人民从苏伊士运河战争、叙利亚维护主权和独立的斗争，以及目前的中东危机中，会很容易分辨出谁是真正的朋友，谁是真正的敌人。
    美国国务院的“机密安全情况”，将使所有的阿拉伯人民以及亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲一切争取民族独立的被压迫的人民更加认清美帝国主义的面貌，丢掉幻想，积极投入斗争。这就是帝国主义者玩弄自以为得计的阴谋诡计所可能得到的唯一结果。
