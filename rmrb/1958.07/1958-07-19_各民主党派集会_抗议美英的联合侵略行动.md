Various democratic parties' central committees have held meetings to discuss the Middle East situation and firmly protest the joint aggression by U.S. and British imperialism in the Middle East. They pointed out that if U.S. and British imperialism insist on expanding their aggression, they will inevitably face complete annihilation throughout the world.

    At the meeting of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), presided over by Li Jishen, Shao Lizi, Chen Shaoxian, Mei Gongbin, Wang Kunlun, Weng Wenhao and others spoke, demanding that the U.S. invading troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and the British invading troops immediately withdraw from Jordan. They seriously warned these madmen to stop playing with fire immediately! Speakers believed that the struggle of the people in the Middle East marked a new upsurge in the national independence movement. The meeting passed a resolution calling on RCCK members and the masses they contact to strengthen their work in all aspects, and together with the people of the whole country, fully support the just struggle of the Arab people.

    On the 17th, the Central Committee of the China Democratic League held a forum with more than 100 people, and the speakers resolutely condemned the aggressive crimes of imperialism.
    
    The China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly convened a forum in Beijing on the 18th with their central committee members and executive committee members. Afterwards, the heads of the two organizations issued statements, pointing out that to save peace and to deal with imperialist aggression, the best way is to resolutely take practical actions to defend peace and give imperialism a double blow.

    They warned the U.S. and British imperialists that they must immediately withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan, otherwise they would be doomed to their own destruction, and the anger of hundreds of millions of people would bury the imperialists like an erupting volcano.

    On the evening of the 18th, the Central Committee members, Beijing Municipal Committee members, and all cadres of the China Association for Promoting Democracy held a protest rally, expressing anger at the aggressive crimes of U.S. and British imperialism, and demanding immediate action to support the Arab people with all their strength. The meeting passed a letter of protest to U.S. and British imperialism, and Ma Xulun, chairman of the CAPD, who is currently ill, also signed the letter of protest.

    The Central Committee and Beijing Municipal Organization of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party jointly held a forum, and the speakers expressed their desire to immediately take practical actions to support the just struggle of the people of Iraq, Lebanon, and the Arab people. They said that if the U.S. and British invading troops do not withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, their final destruction awaits them.

    The China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiusan Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League also held meetings separately. The central leaders of these parties paid close attention to the development of the Middle East situation and expressed their firm support for the Chinese government's statement on the 16th and their full support for the just struggle of the Middle East people. Members of the Jiusan Society also expressed their willingness to work with the people of the whole country to make more achievements in the Great Leap Forward and promote the leap forward of the national independence movement throughout the world. They also stated that as scientific, cultural, and educational workers, they are willing to devote all their efforts to the cause of peace and, when the struggle requires it, listen to the call of the Party and the government and assume the responsibilities they should bear.
