Xinhua News Agency, Amman, 18th. According to the Associated Press on the 18th, quoting sources from the U.S. Embassy in Jordan, Saudi Arabian authorities have refused to allow American planes transporting oil from Bahrain to Jordan to fly over Saudi Arabian airspace.

It is reported that the urgently needed oil was originally scheduled to be transported to Jordan by American planes on the 17th; however, only one plane had arrived by noon on the 18th.

Saudi Arabia is an essential transit point for the direct air route between Bahrain and Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 18th. The Austrian Ministry of Defense announced on the evening of the 17th that, in order to safeguard the security of Austrian airspace, it has dispatched air force units to the provinces of Tyrol and Vorarlberg in western Austria to prevent transport planes carrying U.S. troops from transiting Austrian airspace en route to the Middle East. These planes are taking off from U.S. military airfields in southern West Germany.

The official communique pointed out that the Austrian government had lodged a protest with the United States the previous night, arguing that this troop movement violated Austrian sovereignty and neutrality. However, as of the evening of the 17th, U.S. military aircraft continued to fly over western Austria.

In its protest on the evening of the 16th, the Austrian government emphasized that the U.S. military aircraft's “unauthorized flights over Austria constitute a violation of Austrian airspace. The Austrian government cannot tolerate such actions under any circumstances.”

    沙特阿拉伯不准美机过境
    奥地利派遣空军阻拦侵犯领空美机
    新华社18日讯　安曼消息：据美联社18日援引美国驻约旦大使馆人士的话说，沙特阿拉伯当局已经拒绝让从巴林岛把石油运往约旦的美国飞机飞过沙特阿拉伯的领空。
    据报道，原来预定在17日由美国飞机把急需的石油运到约旦；但是，直到18日中午，只有一架飞机到达。
    沙特阿拉伯是巴林岛和约旦之间直达航线的必经之地。
    据新华社18日讯　维也纳消息：奥地利国防部17日晚上宣布，为了保卫奥地利领空的安全，它已经派遣空军部队前往奥地利西部的蒂罗尔和伏拉尔堡两省，以便阻止载运美国军队的运输机假道奥地利领空飞往中东。这些飞机是从西德南部美军机场起飞的。
    官方公报指出，奥地利政府在前一天晚上已经向美国提出抗议，认为这种军队调动侵犯了奥地利的主权和中立。但是直到17日傍晚为止，仍不断有美国军用飞机飞越奥地利西部上空。
    奥地利政府在16日晚间的抗议中强调说，美国军用飞机“未经允许就在奥地利上空飞行是对奥地利领空的侵犯。奥地利政府无论在何种情况下都绝不能容忍这种行动。”
