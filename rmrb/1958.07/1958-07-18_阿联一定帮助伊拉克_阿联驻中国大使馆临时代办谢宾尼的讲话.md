Dear brothers, ladies and gentlemen:

　　In just two years, history has repeated itself, and the Middle East has again suffered a shameless aggression from a Western country that has always boasted of its love of peace and freedom. After Egypt announced the nationalization of the canal, Britain, France, and Israel jointly attacked Egypt in October 1956, and signs of betrayal emerged internationally. The imperialists sought various excuses for aggression, but due to the heroic resistance of the Egyptian people and the fact that peace-loving countries around the world stood by Egypt's side and supported Egypt, and announced their intention to send volunteer troops to defend Egypt's freedom and independence, these countries were led by the Soviet Union, followed by People's China and other socialist countries.

　　Today, history has repeated itself. The criminal aggressive troops of U.S. imperialism landed in Lebanon without any legal basis, with the aim of consolidating imperialist rule in the Middle East and extinguishing Arab nationalism, which has become a formidable enemy of imperialism, preventing imperialism from carrying out exploitation and oppression.

　　When Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt in 1956, the United States condemned it. How long has it been since the United States engaged in aggressive acts, committing the same mistakes it condemned in others. The United States will suffer the same fate as its allies, because the people of Arab countries and the people of Asian and African countries are united, and they are supported by all peace-loving socialist countries, led by People's China and the Soviet Union.

　　Dear brothers, ladies and gentlemen!

　　In this vast ocean of events, the heroic army of our brotherly country of Iraq, with the assistance of the heroic Iraqi people, launched a revolution, overthrew the dictatorial dynasty, eliminated corruption and imperialist lackeys, declared the Republic of Iraq, and began to study Iraq's foreign policy, deciding to withdraw from the Baghdad Pact and the Arab Union, and to cooperate closely with the liberated Arab countries. After Iraq got rid of autocracy and humiliation, these Arab countries immediately recognized it.

　　The Soviet Union and People's China have announced their recognition of the Republic of Iraq and condemned the U.S. imperialist occupation of Lebanon. The Soviet Union and China have always been loyal Arab friends in times of trouble.

　　Today, the Republic of Iraq is in danger of being invaded by Britain and the United States. Our beloved President Nasser has declared that the United Arab Republic will help Iraq in accordance with the Arab Collective Security Pact, and that aggression against Iraq is aggression against the United Arab Republic.

　　The great Chinese people have expressed the same sentiment. The leaders of the Chinese people believe that aggression against Iraq is aggression against China.

　　May Allah bless the great Chinese people and their loyal leaders! May Allah enable them to always support the cause of justice, freedom, and independence in all countries of the world. Finally, let me cheer long live the great Chinese people! Long live the loyal Chinese leaders!

### 阿联一定帮助伊拉克  阿联驻中国大使馆临时代办谢宾尼的讲话

    阿联一定帮助伊拉克
    阿联驻中国大使馆临时代办谢宾尼的讲话亲爱的弟兄们，女士们，先生们：
    在两年之内，历史又重演了，中东又遭到一个西方国家的无耻侵略，这个西方国家一向吹嘘它爱好和平和自由。埃及宣布把运河收归国有后，英、法、以三国在1956年10月向埃及联合进攻，在国际上出现了背信弃义的征象，帝国主义者寻找侵略的种种借口，但是由于埃及人民的英勇反抗，由于全世界爱好和平的国家都站在埃及一边，支持埃及，而且宣布要派遣志愿军去保卫埃及的自由和独立，这些国家以苏联为首，其次是人民中国和其他的社会主义国家。
    今天历史又重演了，美帝国主义犯罪的侵略军，没有什么法律根据，就在黎巴嫩登陆，其目的是要在中东巩固帝国主义的统治，要扑灭阿拉伯民族主义，因为阿拉伯民族主义已经成为帝国主义的劲敌，不许帝国主义进行剥削压迫。
    1956年英法以三国侵略埃及的时候美国还提出谴责，曾几何时，美国干起侵略的勾当来了，它犯了自己谴责别人的那种错误。美国将要遭它的同盟国家所遭到的同样命运，因为阿拉伯各国人民和亚非各国人民是团结一致的，此外还有以人民中国和苏联为首的一切爱好和平的社会主义国家的支援。
    亲爱的兄弟们，女士们，先生们！
    在这些事件的汪洋大海中，我们的兄弟国家伊拉克英勇的军队，在英勇的伊拉克人民的协助下，发动革命，推翻了独裁的王朝，消灭了贪污腐化和帝国主义走狗，宣布了伊拉克共和国，而且开始研究伊拉克的外交政策，决定退出巴格达条约和伊约联邦，与解放了的阿拉伯各国亲密合作，在伊拉克摆脱了专制和屈辱之后，这些阿拉伯国家立刻予以承认。
    苏联和人民中国已宣布承认伊拉克共和国，而且谴责美帝国主义对黎巴嫩的占领，苏中两国一向是支持在患难中的、忠实的阿拉伯朋友的。
    今天，伊拉克共和国有遭受英美侵略的危险。我们敬爱的纳赛尔总统已经宣言，阿拉伯联合共和国将依照阿拉伯各国集体安全公约帮助伊拉克，对伊拉克的侵略就是对阿拉伯联合共和国的侵略。
    伟大的中国人民也表示了同样的感觉，中国人民的领导者认为对伊拉克的侵略就是对中国的侵略。
    愿真主降福于伟大的中国人民和他们忠诚的领导者！愿真主使他们经常支援世界各国正义、自由、独立的事业。最后，让我欢呼伟大的中国人民万岁！忠诚的中国领袖们万岁！
