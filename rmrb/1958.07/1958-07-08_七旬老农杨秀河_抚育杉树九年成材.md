    Septuagenarian Farmer Yang Xiuhe
    Cultivates Fir Trees to Maturity in Nine Years
    Recently, over 500 fir trees that matured in nine years were discovered in Tianzhu County, Guizhou Province.

    These fir trees were planted in the winter of 1949 by Yang Xiuhe, a member of the Qinxiang Agricultural Cooperative in the county. According to this 70-year-old farmer, the seeds for his fir trees were collected three to five days around the Frost's Descent solar term from thirty-year-old mother trees with lush foliage, large, round cones, and straight trunks, making them better than ordinary seeds. The soil used for seedling cultivation was sun-facing yellow sandy soil, which is most suitable for the growth of fir trees. The forest land was yellow bubble soil and yellow sandy soil with very little alkali content. Before afforestation, the entire area was dug to a depth of five to eight inches. For the first three years, intercropping of grains and trees was carried out, which not only yielded grain but also reclaimed the forest land, promoting the growth of the fir trees.

    In early June, the county's Forestry Bureau conducted an assessment of Yang Xiuhe's fir trees. The fir trees had nine growth rings, confirming that the trees had indeed been cultivated for nine years, with a diameter at breast height of six to six and three inches and a tree height of four zhang, meeting the requirements for felling. His cultivation experience was also preliminarily summarized. A responsible comrade from the Provincial Party Committee inspection team here believed that this is a new discovery in Guizhou Province's forestry production.

    七旬老农杨秀河
    抚育杉树九年成材
    贵州天柱县最近发现了一片五百余株九年成材的杉木。
    这片杉木是该县芹香农业社社员杨秀河在1949年冬季种植的。据这位年已七十的老人谈，他这片杉木的种子是在霜降前后三、五天，从树叶茂盛、球果圆大、树干通直的三十年的母树上采集的，比一般种子好；育苗的土壤是朝阳的黄沙土，这种土壤最宜杉木生长；林地是含碱很少的黄泡土和黄沙土，在造林前全面挖土五至八寸，开始三年还进行林粮混作，不但收了粮食，还垦复了林地，促使杉木的成长。
    6月上旬，该县林业局对杨秀河这片杉树进行了鉴定，杉木的年轮有九道，证实树木的培植确系九年，胸高直径六寸至六寸三，树高四丈，合乎砍伐，并初步总结了他的栽培经验。在这里的省委检查团的一位负责同志认为，这是贵州省林业生产中的一项新发现。
