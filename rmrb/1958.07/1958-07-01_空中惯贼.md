A military aircraft of the United States brutally violated the border of the Soviet Union in the area south of Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Republic, on June 27th. It was forced to land and destroyed by Soviet fighter planes, and nine active-duty U.S. Air Force personnel were detained. The Soviet government sent a note to the U.S. government to lodge a strong protest.

Faced with such irrefutable evidence, the U.S. government not only did not admit its mistake, apologize, and guarantee that similar incidents would not happen again, but shamelessly announced that "the Soviet Union's accusations... are unfounded," claiming the reason was that "it may have strayed off course due to bad weather." This is clearly an attempt to quibble, but the method is too clumsy. Firstly, the American military aircraft intruded into Soviet airspace as far as 170 kilometers, and the forced landing site was 240 kilometers from the point of border violation. How could the route possibly have been "wrong" by such a great distance? Secondly, when Soviet fighter planes took off to order the American aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace to land, the American aircraft continued to intrude until it was forced to land 240 kilometers from the point of border violation. Isn't this ironclad proof of a deliberate violation of Soviet airspace?

After being caught with both human and material evidence, the U.S. government shamelessly quibbled. This not only cannot cover up its ugliness but also exposes the tricks of America, the "aerial habitual thief."

    空中惯贼
    6月27日，一架美国军用飞机粗暴地侵犯苏联亚美尼亚共和国首都埃里温以南地区的边境，被苏联歼击机强迫着陆并焚毁，九名美国空军现役人员被扣留。苏联政府为此照会美国政府提出坚决的抗议。
    在这种人证物证俱在的事实面前，美国政府不但不认错道歉，保证今后不再发生类似事件，反而无耻地宣布说，“苏联的指责……是没有根据的”，理由是“可能因为天气不好而走错航路了”。这显然是企图狡赖，但是，手法未免太拙劣了。因为第一，美国的军用飞机侵入苏联领空远达一百七十公里，而被迫着陆地点在距侵犯边境地点二百四十公里，航路怎可能“走错”这么远呢？第二，当苏联歼击机起飞，要这架侵入苏联领空的美国飞机着陆时，这架美国飞机却继续入侵，直到距侵犯边境地点二百四十公里处才被迫着陆，这不正是蓄意侵犯苏联领空的铁证吗？
    在人证物证俱获之后美国政府还无耻地进行狡赖，这不但不能遮丑，反而暴露了美国的“空中惯贼”的伎俩。
