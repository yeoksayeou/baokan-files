    Big-Character Posters Blossom and Bear Fruit in Rural Guangxi
    Sweeping Away Right-Leaning Conservatism and Capitalist Ideologies, Thoroughly Smashing the "Wait-and-See" Faction
    Everyone Strives to Be Advanced, Every Commune Plants Red Flags, Constantly Revolving, Forever Forging Ahead
    (Our Nanning Dispatch) The rectification and commune consolidation movement, centered on implementing the general line for socialist construction, is unfolding comprehensively in the rural areas of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Now, whether in the mountains or on the plains, big-character posters are being put up, debate meetings are being held, and major production inspections and evaluations are being organized. A socialist democratic movement in which everyone strives to be advanced, every commune plants red flags, and right-leaning conservatism and capitalist ideologies are thoroughly smashed has begun to take shape.
    This rectification and commune consolidation movement in the autonomous region's rural areas is being conducted in close conjunction with current production on the basis of vigorously publicizing the general line. The specific methods are: organizing democratic inspections and evaluations, establishing opposing viewpoints, carrying out rectification while airing views, and combining substance with form. As of June 28, a total of 24,152,993 big-character posters had been put up throughout the region, an average of approximately 2.99 posters per adult. In the Yishan Special District, where the Zhuang people are concentrated, and the Rong County Special District, where the Han people are concentrated, many rural areas are like gardens in full bloom. Trees, walls, doors, windows, and courtyards are all covered with big-character posters. Cadres and farmers inspecting production come and go in the fields, and red, green, or white flags bearing commendations and criticisms are planted everywhere. Of the more than 100,000 big-character posters already put up in Rong'an County, 40% commend good people and good deeds, 40% criticize the "three winds" and "five airs" and capitalist ideologies, and 20% offer various suggestions. In the Da Ming and Da Fang, and major production inspection in Shilong County, the evaluation of "three backward households" and "three backward communes" (the "three" are advanced, intermediate, and backward) has been universally carried out. Villages and communes are bustling with activity, and everyone is catching up with the advanced and every commune is striving to be advanced. When the summer manure accumulation campaign began, the county party committee required the completion of 400 million dan within half a month. As a result, people of all nationalities fought hard for four days and nights, exceeding the plan by 100 million dan. Later, the county's fertilizer accumulation plan was revised and raised to 1 billion dan. On June 15, this figure was once again surpassed by the masses, with the total amount of fertilizer accumulated reaching more than 1.3 billion dan. In order to strive to participate in the National Agricultural Socialist Construction Advanced Units Representative Conference in Beijing this autumn and report production achievements to Chairman Mao, more than 200 agricultural communes in the county are now launching a "Beijing mu" (each mu yielding 2,000 jin of grain) campaign. Driven by the "Beijing mu" campaign, people of all nationalities have reclaimed 240,000 mu of wasteland and expanded the planting area of tubers in a short period of time.
    In the process of Da Ming and Da Fang and major production inspections, it has also been found that some cadres and farmers still have fairly serious right-leaning conservative and capitalist spontaneous thoughts. The "wait-and-see faction," the "middle-of-the-road faction," the "excessive tension theory," the "regional backwardness theory," and the "regional exceptionalism" still have a certain market and influence in some places. After a long period of struggle against drought in some areas, varying degrees of fatigue and aversion have slowly emerged. These various erroneous thoughts and arguments that do not conform to the spirit of the general line are one of the central contents of big-character posters and debate meetings in various places. In the past, the Nahua Agricultural Cooperative in Tiandeng County mostly followed the principle of "sacrificing the collective for the individual" when dealing with the contradiction between collective interests and individual interests, which led to the growth of capitalist spontaneous thoughts among many members. The cooperative planned to plant 600 mu of early rice, but only completed 125 mu. Transplanting middle rice and sowing late rice were not timely, and the progress of many tasks was slow. In this commune consolidation, the members studied the general line, and the 61 households in the cooperative put up a total of 746 big-character posters, launching a major debate on the relationship between the collective and the individual, and fiercely attacking selfish and afraid-of-suffering thoughts. Subsequently, all production teams established new labor discipline, formulated new production measures and leap forward plans, and every household signed a love-the-commune pledge. The attendance rate has recently reached 100%. In the rural areas of Rong County, some cadres and members began to mistakenly believe that "the Communist Party is never satisfied, always wanting more" during the airing of views. Later, after repeated debates, people with this view gradually realized that daring to think and act, never being satisfied, and constantly making revolution are precisely the style of communism, and they should learn from this style. Many agricultural cooperatives in Liujiang, Laibin, and Pingle counties, after learning the lessons of the "saddle shape," automatically returned all the private plots and feed plots that had been left over in the past to the cooperative in order to completely eradicate the roots of capitalist spontaneous thoughts and avoid becoming "promoters of retreat." They invested the extra meat pigs raised in the cooperative to run factories, and wholeheartedly focused on collective production.
    There are also a small number of backward townships and backward communes in various places. In these backward townships and backward communes, the composition of cadres is impure, and capitalist thoughts prevail. There is a contradiction between the advanced and the backward here, but the main issue is still the struggle between two roads. In order to help these backward townships and backward communes pull out the white flags and plant red flags, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee is about to transfer a large number of leading cadres from the directly affiliated organs of the autonomous region's party and government to go deep into the rural areas to assist these areas in rectification and commune consolidation, and completely change the face of the backward townships and backward communes.

    大字报在广西农村开花结果
    横扫右倾保守和资本主义思想　大破观潮派
    人人争上游社社插红旗　不断革命永远前进
    本报南宁电　以贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线为中心的整风整社运动，正在广西僮族自治区农村全面展开。现在，无论山区和平原，都在出大字报，开辩论会，组织生产大检查、大评比，一个人人争上游、社社插红旗、大破右倾保守和资本主义思想的社会主义民主运动，已经开始形成。
    自治区农村这次整风整社运动，是在大张旗鼓宣传总路线的基础上，紧密结合当前生产进行的。具体做法是：组织民主检查和评比，树立对立面，边鸣放边整改，虚实并举。到6月28日为止，全区共贴出大字报二千四百一十五万二千九百九十三张，平均每个成年人约二点九九张。在僮族聚居的宜山专区和汉族聚居的容县专区，许多农村像百花盛开的花园一样。树上、墙上、门窗上和院落里，都贴满了大字报；田野上检查生产的干部和农民来来往往，到处都插着写有表扬和批评意见的红旗、绿旗或白旗。融安县已贴出的十几万张大字报中，表扬好人好事的占40％，批判三风、五气和资本主义思想的占40％，各种建议占20％。石龙县在大鸣大放、生产大检查中，普遍开展评“三游户”和“三游社”（三游是上游、中游、下游），村村社社热火朝天，人人赶先进，社社争上游。夏季积肥运动开始，县委要求在半月内完成四亿担，结果各族农民苦战四昼夜，超额一亿担突破了计划；后来，全县积肥计划修改提高到十亿担，6月15日，这个数字又被群众突破，积肥总量达到十三亿多担。为了争取在今年秋季到北京参加全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议，向毛主席汇报生产成绩，全县二百多个农业社现又开展起“北京亩”（每亩产粮两千斤）运动。在“北京亩”运动推动下，各族农民在短期内开荒二十四万亩，扩大薯类种植面积。
    各地在大鸣大放和生产大检查中，也发现一部分干部和农民仍存在着相当严重的右倾保守和资本主义自发思想。“观潮派”、“中游派”、“过于紧张论”、“地区落后论”和“地区特殊论”，在一些地方还有一定的市场和影响。若干地区经过长期抗旱斗争，慢慢产生了不同程度的疲沓厌倦思想。这些不符合总路线精神的各种错误思想和论调，都是各地大字报和辩论会的中心内容之一。天等县那花农业社过去在处理集体利益和个人利益矛盾时，多以“亏众不亏一”为原则，使不少社员的资本主义自发思想增长起来。全社早稻计划种植六百亩，只完成一百二十五亩，中稻插秧和晚稻播种都不及时，很多工作进度缓慢。这次整社中，社员们学习了总路线，全社六十一户共贴出七百四十六张大字报，开展集体和个人关系的大辩论，猛攻自私自利和怕吃亏等思想。接着，各生产队都建立了新的劳动纪律，制定新的生产措施和跃进规划，户户订立了爱社公约，出工率最近已达到100％。容县农村在鸣放中，开始有少数干部和社员错误地认为“共产党办事不知足，得寸进尺”，后来经过多次辩论，有这种看法的人逐步认识到敢想敢作，永不满足和不断革命正是共产主义的风格，应当好好地向这种风格学习。柳江、来宾、平乐等县有许多农业社社员在接受了“马鞍形”教训后，为了彻底挖掉资本主义自发思想的根子，不当“促退派”，自动把过去多留下来的自留地和饲料地，全部交回社里；把多养的肉猪投资到社里办工厂，一心一意搞好集体生产。
    各地还有一少部分落后乡和落后社。在这些落后乡和落后社里，干部成分不纯，资本主义思想占上风，这里有先进与落后的矛盾，但主要的还是两条道路斗争的问题。为了帮助这些落后乡落后社拔掉白旗插上红旗，中共广西僮族自治区党委即将从自治区党政直属机关，抽调大批领导干部，深入农村协助这些地区整风整社，彻底改变落后乡和落后社的面貌。（附图片）
