Severing the Aggressors' Black Hands (Contemporary Peking Opera)
Ma Shaobo
        First Scene
    (“Rapid Wind” following prelude)
    (At the opening, a black banner with the words "Iraqi Feudal Dynasty" is erected on the stage)
    (Iraqi people, holding a light green flag with the words "Republic of Iraq", enter with "Four Drum Beats", wave the flag, and the chorus sings the tune of "Yellow Dragon Rolling" offstage:
    The Mediterranean sky is clear,
    The Mediterranean sky is clear,
    The people of Iraq have turned themselves over!
    The tyrant is on the execution ground!
    Drive away the pirates to protect our homes, protect our homes!
    After waving the flag, take an axe from their waists, ascend to a high place, and chop down the feudal banner with three strikes, planting the victory flag of the "Republic of Iraq". Follow the "Four Drum Beats" to perform "Facing the Sky with Stirrups".)
        Second Scene
  Characters: American and British Aggressors.
  American: (Enters reciting a rhythmic monologue)
    Everyone says I am a devil,
    I am Eisenhower;
    Everyone curses me as an owl,
    I am the President of the United States;
    Everyone scolds me as a jackal,
    I want to dominate the world;
    Everyone laughs at me as a paper tiger,
    I want to be the master of the globe.
    Alas! Being the master is wishful thinking,
    The whole world is changing greatly:
    The Soviet Union and China are rich and strong,
    The socialist camp shines brightly!
    The Soviet Union's three satellites fly into the sky,
    Each one bigger than the last!
    Hey,
    Their satellites weigh thousands of tons,
    Clumsy and heavy, taking up space;
    Our satellites are so exquisite,
    Like a ping-pong ball,
    Or like an egg yolk,
    Easy to carry,
    Pocket-sized for good keeping.
    America's skilled craftsmen,
    Globally unique, unmatched,
    Who doesn't admire!
    Who doesn't admire!
    Alas, it's heartbreaking to talk about!
    Hateful Chinese Communist Party,
    They liberated China,
    Ever since the Korean War,
    They beat me so badly I cried for my parents!
    This year they formulated the General Line,
    Saying the East Wind is stronger than the West Wind!
    Hahahaha,
    Truly a snake trying to swallow an elephant, overestimating itself, overestimating itself!
    But even though I say this,
    My heart is restless and anxious!
    Let's not mention socialism;
    The anti-colonialist movement is like a tide,
    Impossible to stop,
    Impossible to block,
    The United States and Britain can't get anywhere in Asia and Africa,
    Everywhere they tell us to get the hell out!
    How absurd! How absurd!
    On July thirteenth,
    A thunderclap!
    The people of Iraq overthrew King Faisal,
    And established a republic,
    Not putting the United States and Britain in their hearts!
    This suddenly changed the situation in the Middle East,
    Breaking the spine of my invasion of Western Asia!
    How angry! How frightened!
    Colonialism is about to perish!
    When things come to a head, I have no plan,
    I'll risk my life and make a dash, make a dash!
  British: (Enters reciting a rhythmic monologue)
    Calling out to Old Man America, wait for me,
    The great British Empire has arrived,
    Iraq, dethroned,
    Suffered a great loss in Egypt,
    Now I'm really out of ideas,
    Alas, so unlucky, so annoyed!
    Like autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves!
    Old Man America, Old Man America, tell me quickly,
    What to do when disaster strikes?
  American: (Answers)
    Call me brother, don't shiver,
    Let's have great cooperation between our two countries!
  British: (Answers)
    Aux petits!
    We are brothers in adversity!
    If we die, we die together,
    If we live, we live together!
  American: (Answers) Tigers and wolves want to eat people,
  British: (Answers) First put on a fox's guise,
  American: (Answers) Too little time,
  British: (Answers) No time to put on full disguise;
  American: (Answers) I will send troops to Lebanon!
  British: (Answers) I will reveal my true colors in Jordan,
  American: (Answers) Strangle Iraq!
  British: (Answers) Let's do it with brute force!
  American: (Answers) Heaven will collapse and the earth will crack!
  British: (Answers) No liberation allowed!
  American: (Answers) Let's go, quick as a flash,
  American (White): Okay! (OK)
      (Answers) I will follow, waving flags and shouting slogans.
  American: Attention! Forward march! (Both exit)
        Third Scene
  Time: The morning of July 17th.
  Characters:
  Chinese woman Huang Jie
  Worker Li Yuncheng
  Li's father
  Li's mother
  Li Xiaoling
  Marching and demonstrating masses
  (Worker's family, a radio on the table)
  Huang Jie (Enters singing Xipi Yaoban)
    I just got a message on the street,
    American troops have invaded Lebanon;
    I can't hold back the fire in my heart and rush home...
          (Walks around the stage, enters the door)
  (White) Xiaoling! Xiaoling! Get up! Get up! -- I'm so angry!
  Li's father (Enters from the inner room, continues singing)
    Why has my daughter-in-law returned home?
  (White) Xiaoling's mother, didn't you go to work?
  Huang Jie: Dad, I just heard on the radio on the street: The American devils have landed in Lebanon!
  Li's father: Hey! These robbers! Don't they want to live! Has the newspaper arrived yet?
  Huang Jie: Not yet, I guess.
      (Li's mother and Xiaoling enter)
  Xiaoling: Mom, what's all the fuss about?
  Li's mother: Why have you come back?
      (Huang Jie answers)
  Radio: According to the overall plan of the United States and Britain, British troops began invading Jordan this morning.
      (Huang Jie and others interject: "Hmph! This British devil is making a move too!")
  Radio: "...European proverbs say: 'Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad!' The cooperation between American and British aggressors is nothing but this kind of cooperation in seeking their own graves! The heroic people of the Middle East and all the freedom-loving people of Asia and Africa are preparing a large grave for the Western aggressors. Since the aggressors are determined to enter this grave, let us unite and send them into it!"
  Huang Jie and others: These devils are asking for death!
  Li Yuncheng (Enters angrily: "It's infuriating!" Hands the newspaper to Li's father) Dad, take a look. Xiaoling, this is a telegram from a Lebanese friend to you!
    (Xiaoling excitedly takes the telegram)
  Huang Jie and others: Read it quickly!
  Xiaoling: "Dear Chinese friend Li Ling: American soldiers have landed in my country! Just like the Chinese legend, it is an owl, bringing us misfortune and disaster; but, dear Chinese friend, you must believe that we are Arabs, and no demon can scare us, we will definitely drive them back! Your Lebanese friend Kassem."
  Huang Jie: Right, drive them back!
  Xiaoling: Mom, I have to write back to Kassem quickly.
  Huang Jie: Good, write quickly.
  Li Yuncheng: No hurry to write back, everyone in the factory is preparing to go to the street for a large-scale demonstration, I have my program, I want to quickly write a poem, you help me think!
  Li's father: (Reading the newspaper, sees Eisenhower's ugly face in the newspaper, slams the table and shouts)
    Eisenhower! This kid! Look at this ugly face!
      (Everyone gathers around to look with extreme contempt)
  Li Yuncheng: Right, I've got it: "Eisenhower's hideous jackal face," how's that?
  Huang Jie: … jackal face, "This face, we are not unfamiliar with!" Xiaoling, remember! (Xiaoling responds)
  Li Yuncheng: "The sound of American invading troops killing in Lebanon…"
  Li's father: I, I'll add: "How can we turn a deaf ear to this fierce sound!" Good! Xiaoling, write it down for me!
    (Li's mother turns on the radio)
  Radio: American soldiers get out of Lebanon!
    British soldiers get out of Jordan!
    Oppose imperialist aggression!
    Defend world peace!
  Li's father: Defend world peace!
  Li Yuncheng: Xiaoling, write quickly, I have to go!
  Xiaoling: Got it.
  All: Read it quickly!
  Xiaoling: (Reads the poem) "Eisenhower's hideous jackal face, this face, we are not unfamiliar with; The sound of American and British invading troops killing in the Mediterranean, how can we turn a deaf ear to it!"
  Li's father: Ah, turn a deaf ear.
  Xiaoling: Grandpa, turning a deaf ear sounds more colloquial.
  Li's father: Good, good, colloquial.
  Xiaoling: Below is mine: (The following is recited with music) "Today, tomorrow, day and night, the entire new China, the entire city of Beijing, everyone takes to the streets, everyone raises their iron fists, like the surging waves of the sea, like the thunderous shock of the sky!"
  Huang Jie: I've figured out the following: (The following recitation with music) "The wounds left by American and British aggression in Korea and Egypt have not yet been uncovered, we shouldn't forget the pain so quickly! If you don't immediately withdraw your black hands, we will resolutely cut them off! Make you suffer pain upon pain! The giant wheels of the era will smash your head! The iron hooves of humanity will flatten your old nest! The East Wind prevails over the West Wind! No demons allowed to make trouble!"
  Li's father and others: Right! No demons allowed to make trouble!
    (The sound of the masses demonstrating roars from backstage)
  Li Yuncheng (Takes the poem) Quickly, quickly, I have to go!
  Huang Jie: I'm going too!
  Xiaoling: Grandma, let's go too, let Grandpa watch the house.
  Li's father: Let me watch the house? No way! Grandpa has to demonstrate too!
    (The family exits first, Li's father exits, sweeping his head, locks the door, and runs to the upper stage entrance, meets the marching crowd rushing up, the old man snatches a small flag from his son's hand, rushes to the front and shouts slogans with everyone, "Rapid Wind" exits)
    Fourth Scene
    Characters:
    Lebanese old man, old woman, their daughter Kassem, younger daughter Karen, son Gene, American and British aggressors, the people of Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq, the people of the Soviet Union and China. Except for the Kassem family, the rest are marked with the name of a certain country on a shoulder strap across their chests.
    Lebanese Old Man: (Sings Xipi Daoban from within) Waves are churning on the Mediterranean!
    (The family, armed, struts on with "Fast Long Hammer")
      (Continues singing Yaoban) From now on, no more being sheep!
    Lebanese Old Woman: (Continues singing) The pirates' aggression is wishful thinking!
    Lebanese Old Man: (Continues singing) Colonialism won't last long!
    Kassem: (Continues singing Kuai Ban)
    Hateful Americans and British like tigers and wolves,
    Interfering in internal affairs is unreasonable!
    For freedom, even if we die,
    It's better than stealing life under their iron hooves!
    Karen: (Continues singing Sanban)
    Righteous people will surely be liberated,
    Egypt is a good example for us!
    Lebanese Old Woman: The whole family valiantly heads to the front!
      (Half circle around the stage)
    Gene: (Enters singing) The people of China and the Soviet Union are warmhearted!
      (White) Dad, Mom! Kassem,
    Chinese friends have sent you a letter!
      (Kassem excitedly takes the letter)
    Lebanese Old Woman and others: Who sent it?
    Lebanese Old Man: Where is it from?
    Kassem: Chinese friend Li Xiaoling!
    Lebanese Old Man: Oh! China! China! I, I, I, I'll see, I'll see, (Takes the letter) I'll see!
  (Sings Liushui)
    Written above, greetings and many greetings,
    Greetings to my young friend Kassem,
    Hearing that robbers are bullying the good,
    It's like a blazing fire in my chest!
    The suffering nation must be liberated,
    Only by fighting bravely to resist,
    The forces of peace are great and vast,
    Surely bury the demons in the ocean,
    People's Daily sent a copy,
    Please look at these six hundred million people as a shield!
    Kassem: Oh! There's also a People's Daily!
    Lebanese Old Man and others: Open it quickly! Open it quickly!
    All read: "Arab brothers, six hundred million Chinese people fully support you!"
    Ah, that's great!
    (War drums rumble backstage, owls hoot, and there are sounds of gunfire)
    Lebanese Old Man and others (Shout angrily) Go!
      (Sing) Defend the motherland on the battlefield!
      (American Emperor flies on wearing an owl shape)
    American: Where are the Lebanese people hiding!
    (Pushes half a circle, pushing and squeezing, all over, Lebanese people resist, small fight, the American Emperor escapes, colliding with British Emperor entering wearing a crow shape, American and British escape to the upper stage entrance, Jordanian people intercept, turn back, pass over, exit the lower stage entrance, Iraqi people intercept, surround the stage and shoot. The American and British aggressors are surrounded, the Chinese and Soviet people and the people of all countries (the people of all countries are represented by one person) each hold a large red flag, and split out from the front stage; the formation is two dragons emerging from the water, the American and British go to the inside of the front stage, the Chinese and Soviet people charge outward, the people of all countries circle around the stage, the Chinese and Soviet people expose the eagle and crow shapes of the American and British, throw the "shapes" high, force the American and British to show their true colors, kneel to the front of the stage, the people of all countries perform four drum beats, pose, chorus:
    American and British aggressors, get out quickly! Get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get out of Jordan! Get out of Lebanon! The Arab people are not isolated, the people of the world are our backing! Our backing!
    (The people of all countries sing and make gestures, when the first sentence is finished, the American and British aggressors lie straight on their stomachs, rolling forward with heavy steps to the rhythm of "Get, get, get...". Red flags fly, songs shake the sky, and the curtain closes in an atmosphere of victory.)

          第二场
  人物：美、英侵略者。美：（上说数板）
    人人说我是魔鬼，
    我是艾森豪威尔；
    人人咒我是猫头鹰，
    我是美国大总统；
    人人骂我是豺狼，
    我想世界称霸强；
    人人笑我是纸老虎，
    我想全球我为主。
    哎！我为主，是痴想，
    整个世界大变样：
    苏联、中国富又强，
    社会主义阵营放光芒！
    苏联三颗卫星飞天上，
    一个更比一个壮！
    嘿，
    他们的卫星几千吨，
    又笨又重占地方；
    我们的卫星多玲珑，
    像个乒乓球儿，
    又像个鸡蛋黄儿，
    随身能携带，
    袖珍好保藏。
    美国的能工巧匠，
    全球独份儿，举世无双，
    谁不仰望！
    谁不仰望！
    哎，说起来好心伤！
    可恨中国共产党，
    他把中国大解放，
    自从朝鲜见一仗，
    打得我屁滚尿流叫爹娘！
    今年制定了总路线，
    说什么东风硬比西风强！
    哈哈哈哈哈哈哈，
    真是蛇欲吞象不自量，不自量！
    可是话虽这么讲，
    我心里七上八下直扑趟！
    社会主义且不表；
    反殖民主义运动像浪潮，
    拦也拦不住，
    挡也没法挡，
    美英在亚非吃不开，
    到处都叫我们滚他娘！
    真荒唐！真荒唐！
    七月十三号，
    霹雳一声响！
    伊拉克人民推翻费萨尔王，
    成立了共和国，
    哪把美英放心上！
    这一下子中东局势大变样，
    打断了我侵略西部亚洲的脊椎
      梁！
    好恼怒！好惊慌！
    殖民主义要消亡！
    事到临头无计想，
    拚上性命闯一闯，闯一闯！英：（上接说数板）
    叫声老美等着我，
    来了大英老帝国，
    伊拉克，撤宝座，
    在埃及吃过大窝脖，
    这下子我可要没辙，
    唉，真倒霉，真恼火！
    好像秋风扫叶落！
    老美老美你快说，
    大祸临头当如何？美：（接）
    叫老弟，别哆嗦，
    咱们两国大合作！英：（接）奥瑞提！
    你我难兄又难弟！
    要死一同死，
    要活一块儿活！美：（接）虎狼要吃人，英：（接）先装狐狸样，美：（接）时间太匆忙，英：（接）来不及化好装；美：（接）我出兵黎巴嫩！英：（接）我到约旦露本相，美：（接）扼杀伊拉克！英：（接）蛮干他一场！美：（接）天崩地要裂！英：（接）不准闹解放！美：（接）说走就走奎可雷，英：（白）奥开！（OK）

    美英侵略军，快快给我滚！滚、滚、滚、滚、滚、滚、滚、滚出约旦国！滚出黎巴嫩！阿拉伯人民不孤立，世界人民作后盾！作后盾！
