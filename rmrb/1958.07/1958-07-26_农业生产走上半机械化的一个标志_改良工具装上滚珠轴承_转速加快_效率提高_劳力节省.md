    A Sign of Agricultural Production Moving Towards Semi-Mechanization
    Improved Tools Fitted with Ball Bearings
    Increased Speed, Improved Efficiency, Labor Saving
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Bengbu Special District of Anhui Province is rapidly developing a ball bearing industry to meet the needs of rural tool reform. As of July 6th, in just eight days, 66 ball bearing factories in the district had started production, producing 2,283 sample products. They also sent 20 ball bearing samples to Chairman Mao to report the good news.
    The characteristics of Bengbu Special District's all-out effort to develop the ball bearing industry are that politics takes command, secretaries take action, the masses are deeply mobilized, superstitions are quickly eliminated, the spirit of technical research is strong, there are many types and models of ball bearings, and the product quality is generally good. According to the provincial Party committee's instructions on developing ball bearing production, the Bengbu District Party Committee held a telephone conference on June 28th to make arrangements. Many county party secretaries and county heads personally worked with the workers overnight to study the trial manufacture of ball bearing samples. After two days and nights of hard work, 20 small factories with general power equipment (such as lathes, diesel engines, etc.) and 31 handicraft cooperatives without lathes or power in the district manufactured ball bearings. Xiao Fengyan, the party branch secretary of the Huaiguang Ironware Cooperative in Huaiyuan County, led the cooperative members to work hard and study hard. As a result, the cooperative, without lathes, power, engineering technicians, or steel, not only made ball bearings but also produced ball bearings. Their method was: to take down the ball bearings installed on the small steel grinders, disassemble them, and imitate them. Whenever there was a problem, they would hold a "Zhuge Liang meeting" to study solutions. For example, if there was no lathe to cut grooves, they used digging knives and taps; if there was no steel, they used iron instead; if there was no polishing machine, they modified a hand drill, with an iron box clamped on the bottom layer, using soil sand for the first step, fine sand for the second step, and cowhide for the third step, each time polishing more than 200 ball bearings. Various places also used pliers to replace milling cutters and lathe tools to overcome the difficulty of lacking equipment.
    In order to improve product quality, the Bengbu District Party Committee held a ball bearing professional evaluation meeting in Bengbu from July 5th to 6th. After the initial identification of the trial-produced samples, everyone believed that the heat treatment of ball bearings in Wuhe, the hand-made ball bearings in Fengyang, the flower stand in Dingyuan, and the cylindrical and conical ball bearings in Chuxian all had their good characteristics; in particular, the double-sided 1213 ball bearing created by the Fengyang Ball Bearing Factory was highly praised. Through the evaluation, the comrades present further liberated their minds and broke down superstitions. At present, various places are actively rushing to make and reform special tools, preparing to put them into mass production. The Bengbu District Party Committee requires that all ironware cooperatives and other repair and assembly factories and cooperatives, teams, and agricultural cooperatives with ironware groups all manufacture ball bearings, and set off a climax of vigorously running the ball bearing industry. This year, the district plans to produce 5 million to 10 million pairs of various types of ball bearings. It is expected that by the end of September, more than 300,000 wooden waterwheels and more than 600,000 various vehicles in the district can be equipped with ball bearings.
    (Reported by our newspaper) In Fuyang Special District of Anhui Province, due to the large-scale tool reform movement and the vigorous promotion of ball bearing application to tools, the efficiency of labor has been greatly improved, and the tense and heavy summer planting task has been completed on time without increasing labor intensity.
    In the tool reform movement, Fuyang Special District vigorously promoted the ball bearing application to tools. In the entire district, 33 townships, 175 cooperatives, and more than 2,000 production teams have implemented the ball bearing application of new-style tools, and more than 64,000 new-style tools have been equipped with ball bearings. At present, there are 793 cooperatives and factories that can manufacture ball bearings, of which 622 cooperatives are self-made and self-used by agricultural cooperatives. By the end of July, the reformed carts, water lifting tools, and processing mills will all realize the ball bearing application. The reformed deep plowing double-furrow plows and harvesters, threshers, and other tools that need to be equipped with ball bearings can all be realized by the end of August.
    Due to the vigorous promotion of the tool reform movement and the ball bearing application of tools, the efficiency of tools has been greatly improved, thus greatly alleviating the tension of labor. Preliminary calculations show that the total summer planting area of ​​17 million mu and spring plowing area of ​​5 million mu in the district require a total of 17.6 million workdays, an average of 8 workdays per mu. Each labor force needs to bear 66 workdays during the summer planting period to complete the task of resisting drought and sowing seeds. However, due to the vigorous tool reform, the task was basically completed in about 20 days. According to statistics on July 10th, the entire district has completed 98% of the summer planting task, saving a total of 11,748,000 workdays, reducing the burden on each labor force by 49 workdays.

    农业生产走上半机械化的一个标志
    改良工具装上滚珠轴承
    转速加快　效率提高　劳力节省
    本报讯　安徽省蚌埠专区正迅速发展轴承工业，以适应农村工具改革的需要。截至7月6日止，全区仅八天时间就有六十六个轴承厂投入生产，制出了样品两千二百八十三个。他们并送了二十个轴承样品向毛主席报喜。
    蚌埠专区大干特干轴承工业的特点，是政治挂帅，书记动手，群众发动得深透，迷信破除得快，钻研技术的锐气盛，轴承种类型号多，产品质量一般较好。根据省委关于发展轴承生产的指示，蚌埠地委于6月28日召开电话会议作了部署。不少县委书记和县长亲自连夜和工人一道，研究轴承样品的试制。经过两昼夜的苦战，全区即有二十处有一般动力设备（如车床、柴油机等）的小厂和三十一个无车床、无动力的手工业社制造出轴承来。怀远县怀光铁业社支部书记萧凤雁领导社员苦钻苦研，结果该社在一无车床、二无动力、三无工程技术人员、四缺钢材的情况下，不仅制成了轴承，而且造成了滚珠。他们的办法是：把安装在小钢磨上的轴承拿下来拆开仿制，一有问题就开“诸葛亮会”研究解决办法。例如没有车床车槽子，用挖刀挖，绞刀绞；没有钢，用铁来代替；没有磨滑机，他们把手摇钻改制，底层夹上铁盒子，头道用土砂、二道用细砂、三道用牛皮的办法，每次能磨光滚珠二百多粒。各地还运用了老虎钳子代替铣刀、车刀等办法，克服了没有设备的困难。
    为了提高产品质量，中共蚌埠地委于7月5日至6日在蚌埠召开了轴承专业评比会议，经过对试制样品的初步鉴定，大家认为五河的轴承热处理，凤阳用手工制造的滚珠，定远的花架子，滁县的柱形及椎形的轴承，均有其较好的特点；特别是对凤阳轴承厂创制的双面1213轴承尤为赞扬。经过评比，到会的同志进一步解放了思想，破除了迷信。目前各地正在积极赶制和改制专用工具，准备投入大批生产。蚌埠地委要求各地铁业社和其他修配厂社，队、以及有铁业组的农业社，都来造轴承，掀起一个大办轴承工业的高潮，在今年内全区计划生产各种型号的轴承五百万到一千万副，预计9月底全区三十多万部木制水车、六十多万辆各种车辆，都可安装上轴承。
    本报讯　安徽省阜阳专区由于掀起大规模的工具改革运动，大力推行工具滚珠轴承化，大大提高了劳动功效，紧张繁重的夏种任务已在不增加劳动强度的情况下适时完成。
    在工具改革运动中，阜阳专区大力推行了工具滚珠轴承化。全专区实现新式工具滚珠轴承化的已有三十三个乡，一百七十五个社，二千多个生产队，并有六万四千多件新式工具安上了轴承。现在已会制造滚珠轴承的社、厂有七百九十三个，其中农业社自制自用的有六百二十二个社。到7月底，已改革的大车、提水工具、加工磨三项工具，将全部实现滚珠轴承化。改制的深耕双铧犁和收割机、脱粒机以及其他需要安上滚珠轴承的工具，在8月底即可全部实现滚珠轴承化。
    由于大力推行工具改革运动和工具滚珠轴承化，使工具效率大为提高，因而大大缓和了劳力的紧张情况。初步计算，全区夏种面积一千七百万亩和春耕五百万亩的田间管理，共需工一万七千六百万个，平均每亩合工八个，每个劳动力在夏种期间需负担六十六个工才能完成抗旱下种任务。但由于进行了热火朝天的工具改革，一般都在二十天左右基本完成任务。据7月10日统计，全专区已完成夏种任务98％，共节省工一万一千七百四十八万个，使每个劳动力减轻了四十九个工的负担。
