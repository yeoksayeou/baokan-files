Baoding, July 27th (Reporter): The commercial departments in Hebei Province are vigorously carrying out mass technical innovation movements, marking a significant leap forward in commercial work. In recent months, commercial departments in various regions have implemented over 72,000 inventions and innovations.

Vigorously assisting agricultural cooperatives in reforming backward tools is a primary focus of technical innovation among grassroots commercial department employees in rural areas. They have modified and created thousands of types of agricultural implements, water-lifting tools, transportation tools, and processing tools. These tools generally possess advantages such as locally sourced materials, simple manufacturing, low cost, and high work efficiency, making them very popular among farmers. For example, a wooden automatic water-lifting machine capable of irrigating thirty mu of land per day and requiring no manual labor or animal power costs only 350 yuan per unit. A wooden, animal-powered automatic rice transplanter requires only one animal to pull it, and four people can transplant rice on thirty mu of land in a single day.

Employees in urban retail departments are carrying out technical innovation activities centered on reducing physical labor, improving work efficiency, and facilitating customers. Employees in the coal and timber systems of the Shijiazhuang, Handan, and Xingtai districts have worked diligently for over a month to create more than twenty types of tools, increasing efficiency by two to ten times compared to manual labor. This has enabled the complete mechanization of handling, loading, and unloading of the two most cumbersome commodities, coal and timber, using wooden machinery. Employees in industries such as cotton cloth and non-staple foods have created methods like overhead cloth dispensing, automatic oil dispensers, and automatic measuring devices for transferring liquid commodities. Employees of the Julu County Textile Company formed a creative team and developed six types of sales tools, including automatic cloth-rolling spindles, dimension printing boards, and rapid pricing boxes, creating the miracle of "three no's" in cloth sales—no counters, no rulers, and no abacuses—significantly reducing the time it takes for customers to buy cloth.

The goal of technical innovation for warehouse department employees is to reform handling tools, gradually achieve mechanization, and simultaneously find ways to increase warehouse storage capacity. Warehouse employees in various regions have already created more than ten types of loading and unloading cranes, as well as automatic timber stackers, semi-automatic transfer stackers, and hand-cranked hoists. With automatic timber stackers, workers no longer need to carry timber on their shoulders or climb planks. This not only makes operations safer and increases work efficiency by twenty times, but also allows for higher stacking, increasing warehouse capacity by 20% to 50%.

    商业部门也能革新技术
    河北创造发明七万多件
    本报保定27日电　河北省商业部门蓬勃开展群众性的技术革新运动，使商业工作向前跃进了一大步。最近几个月，各地商业部门已实现的创造发明有七万二千多件。
    大力帮助农业社改革落后工具，是农村基层商业部门职工技术革新的主要内容。他们改制和创造的农具、提水工具、运输工具、加工工具有好几千种。这些工具，一般都具有就地取材，制造简单，成本低、工作效率高等优点，很受农民欢迎。像每昼夜能浇地三十亩的木制自动提水机，不要人工和畜力，每台成本三百五十多元。木制马拉水稻自动插秧机，只需一头牲畜拉，四个人一天能插秧三十亩。
    城镇零售部门的职工开展技术革新活动，以减轻体力劳动，提高工作效率，便利顾客为中心。石家庄、邯郸、邢台三个专区的煤业、木材系统的职工，苦战一个多月，创造出二十多种工具，效率比人工高两倍到十倍，使煤炭、木材两种最笨重的商品的搬运、装卸等，全部实现了木制机械化。棉布、副食品等行业的职工，创造了悬空售布法、自动售油器、搬点液体商品自动衡量器等等。巨鹿县纺织品公司职工成立创造小组，研究出自动卷布轴、尺寸印刷板、速成计价箱等六种售货工具，创造了售布不用柜台、尺子、算盘“三不用”的奇迹，大大缩短了顾客买布时间。
    仓储部门职工技术革新的目标是：改革搬运工具，逐步实现机械化，同时设法提高仓库储存量。各地仓库职工已经创造出装卸起重机十多种，还有木材自动码垛机、半自动转送码垛机、手摇升降机等。有了木材自动码垛机，搬运工人不必再用肩扛和爬跳板了，不仅操作安全，工作效率提高二十倍，而且可以码得高，使仓库容量提高20％到50％。
