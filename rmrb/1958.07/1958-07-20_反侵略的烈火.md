The Flames of Anti-Aggression
By Our Correspondent

"The red tide of anti-aggression is surging, the angry shouts terrify the enemy! This is an endless torrent that will surely drown the war criminals!" Yesterday, the poet Sha Ou, with passion, marched out of the over ten thousand-strong demonstration of the literary and art circles. Facing the British Chargé d'Affaires Office, he roared out righteous verses through a loudspeaker with his resolute voice. These verses express the will of millions of people in the capital and the will of 600 million Chinese people.

These past few days, the entire city of Beijing has been seething. The demonstrators, enraged by the American and British aggressors, are surging like a tidal wave; the angry shouts are as earth-shattering as thunder. The Chinese people, who have grown stronger and stronger in the long struggle against imperialism, understand best the suffering of oppressed nations and how to help them fight for freedom, so that colonialism will eventually disappear from the world.

The Anger of Farmers in Lugouqiao and Workers in Changxindian

The farmers of Lugouqiao Township, who were first invaded by Japanese imperialism twenty-one years ago, and the veteran workers of Changxindian, who have a glorious tradition of opposing imperialism, their yesterday and today are the epitome of the Chinese people's liberation from the enslavement and oppression of imperialism. These days, the farmers of Lugouqiao and the veteran workers of Changxindian have also indignantly joined the unprecedentedly large-scale anti-imperialist demonstration movement of the people in the capital.

More than 1,500 farmers from Lugouqiao Township held a demonstration rally on the 19th. The farmers sweated profusely under the scorching sun, raising their arms and shouting the magnificent slogan "Victory Belongs to the Arab People" based on their personal experience. Here, apart from the ancient Lugouqiao Bridge being preserved as a historical site, the entire appearance of the township has changed beyond recognition. The farmers converted 3,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields in a few months this year, doubling grain production. This year, the income of farmers throughout the township will also increase by 150% compared to last year. They now have their own schools, hospitals, canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens. This is historical evidence: oppressed nations will never succumb to the enslavement and oppression of imperialism; they will only become stronger in struggle. Qi Wenzhou, a fifty-year-old farmer whose leg was broken by a Japanese invading army shell during the "July 7th Incident," never yielded to the might of imperialism. Even after being disabled, he transported shells for the anti-Japanese army and actively participated in anti-Japanese activities. Today, Qi Wenzhou said excitedly at the demonstration rally: "We won in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, and imperialism failed. If American and British imperialism dare to launch a war, they will surely be completely finished!"

The veteran workers of Changxindian, who experienced the "February 7th" storm, have been standing at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle for more than 30 years. After participating in the 500,000-strong demonstration in Tiananmen Square on the 17th, they held a rally in the factory today to oppose the American and British aggression in the Middle East. The 69-year-old veteran worker Zuo Shijun told people that the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory had only been repairing and not manufacturing for 58 years. This year, the workers have not only manufactured the first steam locomotive but are also manufacturing internal combustion locomotives and will soon manufacture electric locomotives. This veteran worker, who has witnessed the Chinese working class grow stronger and stronger in struggle, firmly said: "More than 30 years ago, the strength of our country's working class was still small, but we dared to fight against imperialism, and we finally achieved victory. Today, the strength of the Chinese workers has increased ten thousand-fold. We will not only quickly leave imperialism behind in the Great Leap Forward but will also win a victory in supporting our oppressed brothers in their struggle against aggression." All the veteran "February 7th" workers of this factory immediately wrote a letter of protest, expressing their determination to fight together with the people of the whole country for a peaceful, free, and happy life, and to contribute their strength in the common struggle of oppressed nations against imperialism.

Oppose Aggression and Strive for the Great Leap Forward

In recent days, the broad masses of workers and peasants have been bravely standing at the forefront of opposing wars of aggression while showing their unparalleled strength to imperialism in the Great Leap Forward in production. The workers said that we have two strong shoulders: one shoulder must bear the international responsibility of supporting oppressed nations in their anti-imperialist struggle, and the other shoulder must bear the sacred task of leaving imperialism far behind in the peaceful competition. On both the international and domestic fronts, imperialism must tremble before us.

Anger is burning like a raging fire in the hearts of the employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Shijingshan Power Plant. The employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant are making various preparations to build a power station ten times larger than their own, and the employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant are also vigorously expanding towards becoming a large-scale iron and steel complex. The employees of these two factories originally had soaring enthusiasm. In the past two days, they have held a series of rallies and demonstrations opposing American and British aggression in the Middle East while working intensely in production. After hearing the news of the armed aggression of the Middle East by American and British imperialism, the employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant decided to go to the British Chargé d'Affaires Office to protest. Yesterday, they finally divided into two groups, one group traveling a long distance to the city to demonstrate at the British Chargé d'Affaires Office, and the other group participating in the demonstration with the farmers near the factory. They promised to build a small oil refinery before this year's "August 1st" to strengthen their support for the Arab people. The iron smelting workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held meetings to support the national liberation struggle of the Middle Eastern countries as soon as they walked out of the workshop each day, before the sweat on their heads had even dried. On the 18th, the workers of the No. 2 blast furnace of this factory produced twelve tons of pig iron more than planned, encouraged by their support for the national liberation struggle of the Middle Eastern countries.

On the 17th, the very day that 500,000 people in the capital held a powerful demonstration, the employees of the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant launched a rationalization proposal campaign. In the past three days, people have turned their anger into greater enthusiasm. In just one workshop, 11,851 rationalization proposals were submitted. Li Guodong, a worker in the assembly section of the parts workshop, submitted 172 proposals in one day on the 18th. The youth commando team to which Li Guodong belongs is studying the creation of a new machine that can process more than 30 kinds of parts and increase work efficiency by 45 times. Li Guodong said that now the Arab people are suffering from the aggression of American and British imperialism, and we must exert greater enthusiasm in our production posts to support the struggle of the Arab people.

The Claws of Aggression Extend One Foot, the Power of Justice Rises Ten Thousand Zhang

The peasants used allegro verses to express their hatred for imperialism: "The U.S. imperialists invaded Lebanon, and people all over the world are indignant. Raise high your iron fists and warn the U.S. imperialists to get out quickly!" They are determined to support their Arab brothers with practical actions to strive for a bumper autumn harvest. Wang Falin, the deputy captain of the Rocket Production Team of the China-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative, led his team to participate in the demonstration against American and British aggression in the Middle East at noon on the 17th, and then immediately led the team to launch an attack on the production front. In the past few days, they have won two battles in production: they completed the corn topdressing work originally scheduled to take five days and the weeding task for peanuts and sweet potatoes originally scheduled to take one day in two and a half days. The team members talked while working: our enthusiasm can make nature bow its head and imperialism tremble. Wang Falin recalled his tragic experiences when American imperialism enslaved China through Chiang Kai-shek: he was forced to flee by Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries, which made him hate American imperialism. Therefore, he volunteered to participate in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and performed meritorious service on the Korean battlefield. He said: "We will never allow the crimes of imperialism in Korea to be repeated in the Middle East. I have personally seen how much disaster American imperialism brought to the Korean people. We cannot let our Arab brothers suffer such disasters. If the aggressive claws of American and British imperialism extend one foot, our power of justice will rise ten thousand zhang." The members of the Heita Brigade of the Xishan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Haidian District have seen a sharp increase in the number of people working in the fields these days, from the original 250 to 303, with all the members participating in work. On the 17th and 18th, they completed the weeding and replanting of 93 mu of autumn crops, which is twice as efficient as in the past.

The victorious Chinese people have never taken imperialism and a handful of warmongers seriously. In the past few days, costumed demonstrations showing contempt for the enemy and believing that the Arab people will surely win can be seen everywhere on the streets of the capital: the sound of "war drums" is deafening, and the heroic workers, peasants, and soldiers of Lebanon and Iraq have appeared, pointing their guns at the traitors Chamoun, Said, and the pirates Eisenhower and Macmillan. A young Lebanese "mother" is holding her killed child, seeking justice from the traitors and aggressors together with the angry people. An Iraqi warrior tore the "Baghdad Pact" to pieces, and the pirates were finally trampled under the feet of the righteous Arab people. At this time, the demonstrators warned the war maniacs: "Billions of peace-loving people all over the world will drown you with a single spit! If you dare to strike a stone with an egg and continue to play with fire, you will have no place to be buried!"

British Personnel Dare to Discard Protest Letters; The Masses Order Them to Pick Them Up Themselves

On the morning of the 19th, the demonstration team of more than 3,500 teachers and students from Tsinghua University arrived in front of the British Chargé d'Affaires Office. The angry people handed over a large number of protest letters to the staff of the British Chargé d'Affaires Office standing in the doorway. This Englishman unreasonably threw these protest letters on the ground. The protesters indignantly asked him to pick them up immediately. Not only did he not pick them up, but he said rascally: "It is easy for you hundreds of thousands of people to threaten a few of us." These words were immediately severely refuted by the protesters. Li Hengde, an associate professor of the Department of Engineering Physics at Tsinghua University, sternly reprimanded him: "It is not that we are threatening you, but that you are threatening peace. We peace-loving people are protesting against your aggression! Since you know that there are few of you and many of us, you should immediately get out of Jordan. We also want to tell you frankly: not only are there many of us in China, but there are also many of us all over the world, there are very few of you, and there will be fewer and fewer of you, and there will be more and more of us, do you understand?" Under Li Hengde's righteous words, the Englishman had to ask a staff member of the Chargé d'Affaires Office to pick up the protest letters and letters scattered on the ground one by one.

The verses recited by the poet Wang Yafan in the demonstration crowd more concentratedly expressed people's majestic spirit of despising the enemy: "Fire is not a toy, now the wind has changed. The fire that wants to burn other people's houses will burn your own eyebrows, will burn your own warship. If you don't get out of the Middle East quickly, we will crush you to pieces and you won't be able to go home!"

The Bold Words of the Heroic Mothers

In the surging demonstration crowd, people can also see many heroic mothers, on whom shines the brilliance of the Chinese people's quality of "loving peace, but not fearing war." Jia Zhiwen, a military dependent, personally sent her son to the front line of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Today, all seven members of her family participated in the powerful demonstration against imperialism's aggression in the Middle East or various gatherings. Sun Suchun's mother, who sent six children to the front lines in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, is already 62 years old this year. Today, this heroic mother said at the demonstration rally of more than 10,000 people in Haidian District: "No matter what kind of imperialism, we are not afraid of it! We were not afraid of it when our strength was small in the past, and now that our strength is greater, we are even less afraid of it! We want them to get out of all the places they have invaded!" Mother Sun also passionately warned those war maniacs: "If they want to fight, then we will fight. I will let my six children go to the front line again, and all the Chinese people will go to fight! We won in the past, and we will win even more in the future!"

In all of China, in the Middle East, and in the world, who knows how many such heroic mothers there will be? Their will to resolutely oppose war and safeguard peace is a huge force that no war maniac can understand. (Attached pictures)

    反侵略的烈火
    本报记者
    “反侵略红浪滔天，愤怒的喊声吓破敌人的胆！这是永无止境的洪流，一定要淹死战争罪犯！”昨天，诗人沙鸥激昂地走出文艺界一万多人的示威大军，面对英国代办处，用他那斩钢截铁般的声音，在扩音器前吼出了正义的诗句。这诗句表达了几百万首都人民的意志，表达了六亿中国人民的意志。
    这几天来，整个北京城都沸腾起来了。被美英侵略者激怒了的示威人群，像海涛般澎湃汹涌；愤怒的口号声，像迅雷一样惊天动地。在同帝国主义的长期斗争中成长壮大起来的中国人民，他们最懂得被压迫民族的痛苦，也最懂得应该如何帮助被压迫民族争取自由的斗争，让殖民主义在全世界最终地绝迹。芦沟桥农民长辛店工人的愤怒
    二十一年前首先遭到日本帝国主义的侵略的芦沟桥乡的农民，有着反对帝国主义的光荣传统的长辛店老工人，他们的昨天和今天，就是中国人民从帝国主义的奴役和压迫下获得解放的缩影。这几天，芦沟桥农民和长辛店老工人，也义愤填膺地涌进首都人民空前规模的反对帝国主义侵略的强大示威运动。
    芦沟桥乡的一千五百多农民，在19日举行了示威游行大会。农民们在炎热的阳光下挥汗如雨，他们根据切身经验振臂高呼“胜利一定属于阿拉伯人民”的雄壮口号。在这里，除了古老的芦沟桥被当作历史遗迹还保留着原来的样子以外，整个乡的面貌已经改变得越来越不能辨识了。农民们在今年几个月内把三千亩旱田改成水田，粮食产量翻了一翻，今年全乡农民的收入还将比去年提高一倍半，他们现在已经有了自己的学校、医院、食堂、托儿所和幼儿园。这是历史的见证：被压迫的民族决不会永远屈服于帝国主义的奴役和压迫，他们只会在斗争中越战越强。在“七七”事变那一年被日本侵略军的炮弹打断了一条腿的五十多岁的农民祁文周，从来也没有屈服于帝国主义的淫威，他即使残废以后还给抗日军队运送炮弹，积极参加抗日活动。今天，祁文周在示威大会上激动地说：“在抗日战争中胜利的是咱们，失败的是帝国主义。美英帝国主义胆敢发动战争，他们就一定彻底完蛋！”
    经历过“二七”风暴的长辛店老工人，三十多年来一直站在反帝斗争的最前线。他们17日到天安门参加了首都五十万人的示威游行以后，今天又在厂里举行了反对美英侵略中东的集会。六十九岁的老工人左士俊告诉人们，长辛店机车车辆修理工厂五十八年来光修理不制造，今年工人们不但已经制造出第一台蒸汽机车，并且正在制造内燃机车，不久还要制造电气机车。这位眼看着中国工人阶级越战越壮大的老工人坚定地说：“三十多年前，我国工人阶级的力量还很小，但我们敢于同帝国主义斗争，我们终于取得了胜利。今天，中国工人的力量已强大千万倍，我们不但在大跃进中将要很快把帝国主义抛在后头，并且一定在支援被压迫兄弟反对侵略的斗争中打个胜仗。”这个厂的全体“二七”老工人当场写下一封抗议书，表示要同全国人民一起，为和平、自由、幸福的生活而斗争，在被压迫民族反对帝国主义的共同斗争中贡献自己的力量。
    一面反侵略　一面大跃进
    广大工人农民这几天来一面英勇地站在反对侵略战争的最前列，一面在生产大跃进中向帝国主义显示自己的无比力量。工人们说，我们有两个坚强的肩膀，一个肩膀要肩负起支援被压迫民族反帝斗争的国际责任，一个肩膀肩负起在和平竞赛中把帝国主义远远抛在后面的神圣任务。在国际和国内的两条战线上，都要让帝国主义在我们的面前发抖。
    愤怒像烈火一样燃烧在石景山钢铁厂和石景山发电厂职工的心里。石景山发电厂的职工正为包建一个比本厂大十倍的发电站而做着各种准备工作，石景山钢铁厂职工也正在大力扩建向着大型钢铁联合企业迈进，这两个厂的职工本来都有着冲天的干劲，这两天，他们一面紧张生产，一面又都召开了一连串的反对美英侵略中东的集会和示威游行。石景山发电厂的职工在听到美、英帝国主义武装侵略中东的消息后，就决心进城到英国代办处门前游行，昨天，他们终于分成两路，一路远道进城来向英国代办处示威，一路在工厂附近和农民一起参加了游行。他们保证要在今年“八一”以前建成一座小炼油厂，以增强支援阿拉伯人民的力量。石景山钢铁厂的炼铁工人每天刚刚走出车间，头上的汗珠还未落，就开会声援中东各国人民。18日，这个厂的二号高炉工人，在支援中东各国人民民族解放斗争的鼓舞下，多生产了十二吨生铁。
    17日，就在首都五十万人举行强大示威游行的那一天，北京汽车制造厂职工掀起了合理化建议运动。三天来，人们把怒气变成了更大的干劲，仅一个车间就出现了合理化建议一万一千八百五十一件。附件车间装配工段工人李国栋，18日一天就提出建议一百七十二件。李国栋所在的青年突击队，正在研究创造一种能加工三十多种零件、可以提高工作效率四十五倍的新机器。李国栋说，现在阿拉伯人民正遭受美英帝国主义的侵略，我们就要在生产岗位上发挥更大的干劲，支持阿拉伯人民的斗争。
    侵略魔爪伸一尺  正义力量高万丈
    农民们用快板诗表明他们对帝国主义的痛恨：“美帝侵略黎巴嫩，全世界人民都愤恨，高高举起钢铁拳，警告美帝赶快滚！”他们决心以争取秋季大丰收的实际行动，支援阿拉伯弟兄。中苏友好农业社火箭生产队副队长王法林，17日中午率领他的队员参加反对美英侵略中东的示威游行以后，又立刻带队在生产战线上展开进攻。这几天，他们在生产上打了两个胜仗：用了两个半天的时间，完成了原定五天完成的玉米追肥工作和预定一天完成的花生、白薯锄草任务。队员们一边劳动一边谈论：我们的干劲能使大自然低头，叫帝国主义发抖。王法林回忆起他在美帝国主义通过蒋介石奴役中国时的悲惨遭遇：他曾被蒋介石反动派抓兵逼得外逃，这使他恨透了美帝国主义，因此，他曾志愿参加抗美援朝的斗争，并且在朝鲜战场上立了功。他说：“我们绝不允许帝国主义在朝鲜的罪恶又在中东重演，我亲眼看到美帝国主义给朝鲜人民带来了多大的灾难，我们不能让阿拉伯兄弟遭到这样的灾难。美英帝国主义的侵略魔爪伸出一尺，我们的正义力量就高升万丈。海淀区西山农业生产合作社黑塔大队的社员，这几天的出勤人数由原二百五十人猛增到三百零三人，所有的社员都出了勤。十七、十八两天，他们就完成了九十三亩秋作物的除草、补苗工作，比过去效率提高了两倍。
    胜利了的中国人民，从来也不把帝国主义和一小撮战争贩子放在话下。几天来，首都街头到处都可以看到藐视敌人和相信阿拉伯人民一定胜利的化装示威：“战鼓”声如雷震耳，英雄的黎巴嫩和伊拉克的工人、农民和士兵们出现了，他们把枪口对向卖国贼夏蒙、赛义德和海盗艾森豪威尔、麦克米伦。年轻的黎巴嫩“母亲”抱着被杀死的孩子，正在同愤怒的人民一起向卖国贼和侵略者讨还血债。一位伊拉克勇士把“巴格达条约”撕得粉碎，海盗们终于被正义的阿拉伯人民踩在脚下。这时，示威的人群警告战争狂人：“全世界几十亿爱好和平的人民每个人吐一口唾沫也会把你们淹死！如果你们胆敢以卵击石，继续玩火，管叫你们死无葬身之地！”
    英国人员胆敢丢弃抗议信  群众喝令他们自己拾起来
    19日清晨，清华大学三千五百多师生的示威队伍来到了英国代办处门前。愤怒的人们把大批抗议书交给站在门洞里的英国代办处工作人员，这个英国人无理地把这些抗议书丢在地上，抗议的人们愤慨地要他马上拾起来，他不但不拾，并无赖地说：“你们几十万人，威胁我们几个人是很容易的事情。”这些话立刻遭到抗议的人们的严厉驳斥。清华大学工程物理系副教授李恒德，严正地斥责他说：“不是我们威胁你们，而是你们威胁了和平，我们爱好和平的人民抗议你们的侵略行为！你既然知道你们的人少，我们的人多，你们就应该立刻从约旦滚出去。我们还要正告你们：不仅在中国是我们的人多，在全世界还是我们的人多，你们的人很少，而且你们的人要越来越少，我们的人将越来越多，你明白没有？”在李恒德的正义言词驳斥下，这个英国人不得不叫代办处一位工作人员把散落在地上的抗议书、信一一拾起来。
    诗人王亚凡在示威人群中高声朗诵的诗句，更集中地表达了人们藐视敌人的雄伟气魄：“火不是好玩的，如今风向变了，想烧人家房屋的烈火，会燃烧你自己的眉毛，会烧毁你自己乘坐的战船，要不赶快从中东滚蛋，就叫你粉身碎骨回不了家！”
    英雄的母亲们的豪语
    在汹涌不断的示威人群中，人们还可以看到许多英雄的母亲，在她们的身上，闪耀着中国人民“酷爱和平，但也不怕战争”的这种气质的光辉。军属贾芝文曾经亲自把她的儿子送上抗美援朝战争的前线，今天她们全家七个人都参加了反对帝国主义侵略中东的强大示威或者各种集会。曾经在抗日战争、解放战争和抗美援朝战争中把六个孩子先后送上前线的孙素椿妈妈，她今年已经六十二岁了。今天这位英雄的母亲在海淀区一万多人的示威大会上说：“不管什么帝国主义，我们都不怕它！过去咱们力量小不怕它，现在我们力量大了，更是不怕它！我们要它们从它们侵略的一切地方滚出去！”孙妈妈还激昂地警告那些战争狂人：“如果他们要打，咱们就打，我让六个孩子重上前线，咱们全中国人民都去打！过去咱们胜利了，将来咱们更要胜利！”
    在全中国，在中东，在全世界，不知道将有多少这样的英雄母亲，她们坚决反对战争维护和平的意志，是任何战争狂人都不可理解的巨大的力量。（附图片）
