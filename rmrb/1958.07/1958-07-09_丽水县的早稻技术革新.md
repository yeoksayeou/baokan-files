	Great Certainty

In the corridor of the Lishui County Party Committee office, there stood a clump of tall, deep-green early rice in a water basin. It startled me. I walked closer and compared it to my body. The tip of the ears touched my neck. Counting them, one ear had more than 120 grains, almost all of them plump. A comrade from the County Party Committee office explained to me that it had just been pulled from an experimental field in Shuangxi Township, Yaxi District. He added, "There is more than just one or two fields like this. There are some in Bihu District and other districts as well.”

I followed the visiting delegation from Jiande and other counties to visit these two districts—the mountainous Yaxi and the plains of Bihu, and took the opportunity to see the County Party Committee’s base point—Lidong Township in the county seat—and the County Party Committee’s experimental fields.

The next day, we took a twenty-mile car ride and walked twenty miles of mountain trails, crossing two mountain ridges, before arriving at Shuangxi Township in Yaxi District. In the small Ao of Huang Village, I saw the early rice I had seen in the County Party Committee. Here, three sides are high mountains, and the distance between the foothills on both sides is no more than two hundred meters. We estimated that even in summer, the time the sunlight could shine on this entire rice field was only five or six hours. In this narrow, long mountain field, such extraordinary early rice was growing.

The third day, I accompanied several county party secretaries to Bihu District, forty miles from the county seat. From one end of the town to the other, on a large field of rice stretching for several miles, we saw the same outstanding scene. Most of the rice fields were marked with red flags, indicating the name of the commune, the variety, the density of planting, the number of clumps, the number of stalks, the number of grains, the yield, etc., indicating that these were all high-yield fields. We happened to see a white flag on a small plot of rice, indicating that it was a backward seedling.

Of the county's more than 150,000 mu of early rice, more than 17,000 mu had been backward seedlings. And now, there were only a little over a thousand mu of backward seedlings left. One visitor looked at the backward seedlings in Bihu Town and said humorously: “In previous years, this field wouldn’t have qualified as a first-class seedling, but it would have qualified as a second-class seedling.”

After visiting the early rice in the mountains and the plains, I no longer doubted a sentence from Pan Shencun, the Party Secretary of Shuangxi Township in Yaxi District: "Early rice harvest is not just promising, it is greatly certain."

The belief of "great certainty" was certainly not obtained by luck; it came from a period of arduous agricultural technology innovation.

	Early Planting and Dense Planting

The water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation movement of the past winter and spring first created very favorable conditions for a bumper harvest of early rice. The more than four million cubic meters of earth and stone completed in water conservancy construction was equal to four times the total amount of earth and stone completed during the First Five-Year Plan period, increasing the drought resistance capacity from forty-three days to sixty-three days, changing the past natural landscape of "five days of sun, the fields run out of water; two days of heavy rain, the fields become oceans." More than 300 million dan of fertilizer were accumulated, an average of more than 1,600 dan per mu, which was 33 times more than the same period last year. The county's farmers made full use of these two favorable conditions, increasing the early rice area from more than 40,000 mu last year to more than 150,000 mu all at once, and most of the rice fields changed from single-season to double-season, from intermittent cropping to continuous cropping. At the same time, an agricultural technology innovation movement centered on dense planting was launched.

Transplanting was advanced by half a month (plains) to a month (mountains) compared to previous years, and dense planting was also greatly increased compared to previous years. Last year, 6×8 (6-inch plant spacing, 8-inch row spacing), 7×9, and 4×8 accounted for 99% of the total early rice area, while this year it was generally changed to within 4×6, reaching more than 25,000 clumps per mu.

In order to achieve early planting and dense planting, several obstacles had to be overcome.

One obstacle was increasing the amount of seeds sown. In previous years, the amount of seeds sown per mu was only eight jin, but this year it had to be increased to eighteen to twenty jin. The leadership calculated the accounts for the masses: This year, the degree of dense planting has been increased, and each mu must have 25,000 to 40,000 clumps, which is three to seven times more than in previous years, in order to guarantee a bumper harvest. After debate, cadres and the masses accepted this innovative measure. Then, the contradiction of insufficient rice paddies had to be resolved. This year, a total of 15,000 mu of rice paddies were needed, accounting for 10% of the total early rice area; last year, aquatic rice seedlings accounted for 47% of the rice paddies. If the rice paddies were not reformed, it would inevitably affect early planting. To this end, the county universally utilized vacant land and idle land in front of houses and villages to sow dry rice seedlings and semi-dry rice seedlings, basically eliminating aquatic rice seedlings.

Another obstacle was raising the standards for dense planting. Some people had five fears about dense planting: fear of trouble, fear of high labor costs, fear of dragging out the season, fear of reduced production, and fear of difficulty in weeding. Some people said: "So dense, even three-inch golden lotuses can't step in." Some people said: "Sparse fields yield more grain, dense fields yield more weeds; dense planting cannot increase production." Various localities also organized on-site meetings and mobilized the masses to speak out freely to address this conservative thinking. An experienced transplanting worker in Shuidong Township calculated an account for everyone: Using the old specifications of 8×12 from previous years, only more than 6,000 clumps could be planted per mu. Based on twenty ears per clump, seventy grains per ear, and twelve hundred grains per liang, only about four hundred jin could be harvested per mu; this year, using the 4×6 specifications, 25,000 clumps could be planted per mu, harvesting 1,400 jin of grain. This calculation convinced those commune members. The county thoroughly eliminated the old specifications of 4×8, 6×8, and 7×9.

Yet another obstacle was improving transplanting efficiency. In previous years, the county averaged only a third of a mu transplanted per person per day. At this rate, it would be impossible to guarantee the completion of early rice transplanting before the Beginning of Summer. Thus, a high-record transplanting movement was launched. Many places held field debates, and the county party committee convened an on-site meeting where cadres personally took action, leading the masses to learn transplanting together. One high record after another appeared, increasing the transplanting efficiency by an average of more than one time, and cultivating more than four hundred transplanting experts who averaged more than one mu transplanted per day, guaranteeing the timely completion of early rice transplanting.

	Four Guarantees and Five Determinations

With the advancement of the transplanting season, the increase in dense planting standards, and the increase in fertilizer application, the growth process of early rice this year would inevitably be a new journey, and a series of new technologies must be used to constantly resolve new contradictions.

These contradictions were: 1. The backward weeding methods were no longer applicable. In the past, the first weeding was generally done about twenty days after transplanting; however, this year, all were 3×5 and 4×6 dense plantings, and the rice seedlings were sealing rows early, and most of the early rice was Nantex-16, Nantex, and 503 improved varieties, which only needed seventy-five to eighty days to mature. According to the old methods, it would inevitably affect the growth of the rice seedlings. At the same time, the old-style field harrows could no longer fit into the densely planted rows and furrows, and this contradiction was also very acute. 2. This year, the amount of base fertilizer increased greatly, but the fertilizer effect was mostly slow-acting. Thus, the early stage of early rice growth would inevitably have insufficient fertility and poor development, while the later stage would have a rapid fertilizer effect, leading to lodging. Rational irrigation and pest control were also not keeping up. 3. The original, relatively simple field management system was also not adapted to this year's production characteristics. In particular, some cadres and the masses, after achieving victories in water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, early planting, and dense planting, saw that the rice seedlings were growing well and developed a complacent and relaxed attitude, waiting for a bumper harvest. Some commune cadres said: "This year, the season is early and the base fertilizer is sufficient. Carelessly planting rice is guaranteed to be good." Some commune members said: "We transplanted the seedlings early, let's take our time, it won't be too late."

Based on the experience gained in the base-point township—Lidong Township—the county party committee formulated a new field management system of Four Guarantees and Five Determinations, convened a meeting of key personnel in the county, and criticized the complacent and relaxed attitude of waiting for a bumper harvest. After the meeting, the masses were mobilized to speak out freely, and based on many rationalization proposals put forward by the masses, specific operating procedures and technical requirements were further formulated.

The Four Guarantees were to guarantee the number of plants (stalks), the number of ears, the number of grains, and the yield per mu, so that the high-yield targets were established on a reliable basis.

The Five Determinations were to determine the weeding time, determine rational fertilization, determine rational irrigation, determine pest control, and determine the management system.

From the end of April, the Four Guarantees and Five Determinations movement was launched throughout the county. Every day, a force of 60,000 laborers worked hard in the valleys and basins. In two months, they nurtured every clump and every stalk of rice seedlings like loving mothers, so that they could grow and strengthen faster.

In the Four Guarantees and Five Determinations movement, Lishui County created and developed many good experiences. The production teams of various agricultural communes established a system of agronomic management based on the original field chief system. Each team selected five to seven active, reliable, and experienced old farmers and young people who were willing to study to serve as agronomists. Agronomists had three main responsibilities: (1) to be responsible for checking and improving technical measures such as weeding, fertilization, irrigation, and pest control; (2) to be responsible for acceptance and scoring. If the agricultural work did not meet the standards, the agronomists had the right to supervise the commune members to rework or deduct points; (3) to be responsible for publicity, commending good people and good deeds, and promoting management experience. In short, the agronomist was both a technician, an inspector, and a propagandist, so they were also called "three-in-one." In the implementation of the technical measures of Four Guarantees and Five Determinations, the county strengthened labor management, improved labor organization, mobilized commune members to self-report for labor and democratically assign tasks, and improved labor efficiency. Methods such as implementing equal pay for equal work were used to organize women to participate in production, and various temporary groups were organized to adjust agricultural work. Party secretaries at all levels personally took action to vigorously grasp the reform of weeding tools. Under the three-way combination of leaders, industrial workers, and old farmers, more than twenty types of weeding tools, totaling more than 40,000 pieces, were created and improved, increasing efficiency by three to four times and greatly accelerating the progress of weeding.

	Field Diagnosis

In late May, the county party committee discovered that the growth of early rice was uneven, and 17,000 mu of backward seedlings had appeared in the county. Therefore, the county party committee again made the elimination of backward seedlings a major part of the Four Guarantees and Five Determinations movement at that time, and once again mobilized the masses to speak out freely and debate. The county posted 50,000 large-character posters and put forward many good suggestions.

At this time, Shiniu Commune, Pingyuan Township, Bihu District, created a new experience of field diagnosis. The method was for agronomists and old farmers to diagnose backward seedlings in the rice fields, prescribing prescriptions, dispensing medicines, and treating them while watching. Zhang Jieqing, the county party secretary, was inspecting the growth of early rice in Bihu District at the time. He immediately summarized and promoted the experience of Shiniu Commune and established an agronomist's follow-up system, checking once a day until the disease of the backward seedlings was cured. After field diagnosis and follow-up, the 17,000 mu of backward seedlings quickly decreased to a little over 1,000 mu, and many townships' backward seedlings rose to first-class seedlings.

Here's an introduction to how one production team carried out field diagnosis.

The Fifth Production Team of Houpu Commune, Lidong Township, diagnosed backward seedlings in late May and diagnosed four symptoms: 1. Nutrient deficiency, yellowing, short seedlings, and thin leaves; 2. Pests, not serious, but relatively common; 3. Substandard weeding, with many weeds remaining; 4. Irrational irrigation, water interruption, and dry soil. Among these four symptoms, the first was the most serious and covered the largest area. At the team's debate meeting, everyone expressed their determination to eliminate backward seedlings. One commune member said well: "If people are sick, they should ask a doctor and get some medicine to take; if rice is sick, it should also be diagnosed, given medicine, and cured." In the end, the agronomists, together with the commune members, wrote a prescription for the backward seedlings: 270 dan of human manure, 830 dan of mud ash, 650 jin of alum, and 56 jin of "666" insecticide powder. Then, they treated the rice seedlings with different symptoms separately.

    丽水县的早稻技术革新
    本报记者  张潮
        大有把握
    在中共丽水县委办公室的走廊上，摆着一丛盛在水盆里的高大深绿的早稻。它使我吃了一惊，走近去用身子一比，穗尖触到了我的头颈。数一数，一个穗头有一百二十多粒，几乎粒粒饱满。县委办公室的同志向我解释说，这是刚从雅溪区双溪乡的一丘试验田里拔来的；他又补充了一句：这样的早稻，不止一丘两丘，在碧湖区和其他区里也有。
    我跟随建德等县的参观团，访问了这两个区——山区的雅溪和平原的碧湖，趁便看了看县委的基点——城关丽东乡和县委的试验田。
    第二天，我们坐了一段二十里路的汽车，走了一段二十里路的山间小道，翻过两个山岭，才到了雅溪区的双溪乡。在小小的黄村的岙里，看到了我在县委会看到过的早稻。这里三面是高山，两边山脚相距不过两百多公尺。我们估算了一下，即使在夏天，阳光能照到这整片稻田的时间，不过五、六小时。就在这片狭长的山垅田里，生长着这样出奇的早稻。
    第三天，我又随同几个县的县委书记到离县城四十里的碧湖区。从镇子的一端绕到另一端，在几里长的一大片稻田上，我们看到了同样出色的景象。大部分稻田插上了红旗，旗上注明什么社、什么品种、密植规格、丛数、秆数、粒数、产量等等，说明这些都是丰产田。我们偶然在一小丘稻田上看到一面白旗，说明这是落后苗。
    在全县十五万多亩早稻中，曾经出现过一万七千多亩落后苗。而现在，落后苗只剩下一千多亩了。有一位参观者看了碧湖镇的那丘落后苗，幽默地说：要是在往年，这丘田够不上一类苗，也够得上二类苗呢。
    参观过山区和平原的早稻后，我再也不怀疑雅溪区双溪乡的乡党委书记潘深村的一句话：“早稻丰收不是大有希望，而是大有把握。”
    “大有把握”，这个信念当然不是侥幸得来的，它来自一段艰苦的农业技术革新的历程。
      早插密植
    去冬今春的兴修水利和积肥运动，首先给早稻丰产创造了十分有利的条件。兴修水利中所完成的土石方四百多万公方，等于第一个五年计划期内完成的土石方总数的四倍，把抗旱能力从四十三天提高到六十三天，改变了过去“五天见太阳，田里断水源；大雨下两天，田里成海洋”的自然面貌。积肥三亿多担，每亩平均一千六百多担，等于去年同期的三十三倍。全县农民充分利用了这两个有利条件，把早稻面积从去年的四万多亩一下子扩增到十五万多亩，并且大部分稻田改单季为双季，改间作为连作，同时开展了以密植为中心的农业技术革新运动。
    插秧比往年提早了半月（平原）至一个月（山区），密植也比往年大大提高，去年6×8（株距六寸，行距八寸）、7×9、4×8的占早稻总面积的99％，今年一般改为4×6以内，每亩达到两万五千丛以上。
    为了做到早插密植，必须冲破几道关口。
    一道关是增加播种量。往年每亩播种量只有八斤，今年要增加到十八——二十斤。领导上给群众算了账：今年提高了密植程度，每亩必须有二万五千到四万丛，比往年增加三至七倍，丰产才有保证。经过辩论，干部和群众接受了这个革新措施，跟着还要解决秧田不足的矛盾。今年秧田共需一万五千亩，即占全部早稻面积10％；去年水秧又占秧田面积的47％。如果不改革秧田，必然影响早插。为此，全县普遍利用屋前村旁的空地闲地，播种旱秧和半旱秧，基本上消灭了水秧。
    再一道关是提高密植标准。一部分人对密植有五怕：怕麻烦、怕花工大、怕拖长季节、怕减产、怕不好耘田。有的人说：“这样密，就是三寸金莲也踏不进去。”有的人说：“朗田多谷，密田多草，密植不能增产。”各地又针对这种保守思想，组织了现场会议，发动群众大鸣大放。水东乡有一个插秧手给大伙算了一笔账：用往年8×12的老规格，每亩只能插六千多丛，每丛按二十个穗头、每个穗头按七十粒、每一千二百粒谷为一两计算，每亩只能收四百斤左右；今年用4×6的规格，每亩就能插二万五千丛，收一千四百斤谷。这一算，把那些社员算得心服口服了。全县彻底消灭了4×8、6×8、7×9等老规格。
    又一道关是提高插秧效率。往年，全县每人每天平均只能插三分，照这个速度，就无法保证立夏前插完早稻。于是开展了一个插秧高纪录运动，许多地方进行了田头辩论，县委又召开了一次现场会议，干部亲自动手，带领群众一起学插秧，高纪录一个接一个出现了，把插秧效率平均提高了一倍以上，并且培养了四百多名平均每天插一亩以上的插秧能手，保证了早稻按时插完。
        四保五定
    插秧季节的提早，密植标准的提高和用肥数量的增加，今年早稻生长过程必然是一个新的历程，必须用一系列的新的技术来不断解决新的矛盾。
    这些矛盾是：一、落后的耘田方法已经不适用了。过去一般是在插秧后二十天左右才耘第一次田；可是今年全部是3×5、4×6密植，稻苗提早封行，而且早稻大部分是南特十六号、南特号和503良种，成熟期只需七十五到八十天，按照老办法，势必影响稻苗生长。同时，旧式田耙已经放不进密植的行垅，这个矛盾也很尖锐。二、今年基肥数量大增，但肥效是慢性的多，这样，早稻生长前期必然肥力不足，发育不良，而后期则肥效猛发，发生倒伏；合理灌溉、防治病虫害等工作也还跟不上去。三、原有的比较简单的田间管理制度也不适应今年的生产特点了。特别是有一部分干部和群众，在水利、积肥、早插、密植取得胜利之后，看到稻苗生长良好，就产生了自满松气、坐等丰收的情绪。有的社干部说：“今年季节早，基肥足，随便种种水稻保证好。”有的社员说：“我们提早插下秧，慢慢来吧，晚不了。”
    县委根据在基点乡——丽东乡取得的经验，制定了四保五定的新的田间管理制度，召开了全县骨干分子会议，批判了自满松气、坐等丰收的情绪。会后又发动群众大放大鸣，并且根据群众提出的许多合理化建议，进一步制定了具体的操作规程和技术要求。
    四保就是保每亩的棵数（秆数）、穗数、粒数和产量，使丰产指标建立在可靠的基础上。
    五定就是定耘田时间、定合理施肥、定合理灌溉、定治虫害、定管理制度。
    从4月下旬起，四保五定运动在全县范围内开展起来。每天有六万劳动大军，苦战在山谷盆地，在两个月时间里，他们像慈母一样，时时刻刻地抚育着每一丛、每一棵稻秧，使它更快地成长壮大。
    在四保五定运动中，丽水县创造和发展了许多好经验。各农业社的生产队，在原有的田长制基础上，建立了农艺师管理制。每个队在社员中选出五至七名积极可靠、有一定生产经验的老农和肯钻肯学的青年来担任农艺师。农艺师有三项主要职责：（一）负责检查和改进耘田、施肥、灌溉、除虫等技术措施；（二）负责验收评分，不合标准的农活，农艺师有权督促社员返工或扣分；（三）负责宣传工作，表扬好人好事和推广管理经验。概括地说，农艺师既是技术员，也是验收员和宣传员，所以又叫“三员合一”。在实施四保五定的技术措施中，全县加强了劳动管理，改善了劳动组织，发动社员劳动自报、民主派活，提高了劳动效率。用贯彻同工同酬等办法组织妇女投入生产，组织各种临时小组来调整农活。各级党委书记亲自动手，大抓耘田工具的改革，在领导、手工业工人和老农的三结合下，创制和改良了二十多种、四万多件耘田工具，提高效率三、四倍，大大加速了耘田进度。
      田头会诊
    5月下旬，县委发现早稻生长不平衡，全县出现了一万七千亩落后苗。因此，县委又把消灭落后苗作为当时四保五定运动的一个主要环节，再次发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，全县贴出了五万张大字报，提出了很多好建议。
    这时候，碧湖区平原乡石牛社创造了田头会诊的新经验。办法就是农艺师和老农在稻田里会诊落后苗，边看病、边处方、边配药、边治疗。县委书记张介青当时在碧湖区检查早稻生长情况，他立即总结和推广了石牛社的经验，并且确立了农艺师的复诊制度，每天检查一次，直到把落后苗的病治好为止。经过田头会诊和复诊，一万七千亩落后苗很快就减少到一千多亩了，而且有许多乡的落后苗上升为一类苗。
    这里介绍一个生产队怎样进行田头会诊。
    丽东乡后铺社第五生产队，在5月下旬会诊落后苗，诊断病症有四：一、脱肥发黄，苗短叶细；二、虫害，虽不严重，但较普遍；三、耘田不合标准，仍有很多杂草；四、灌溉不合理，水断土燥。这四种病症中，最严重的面积最大的是第一种。在全队的辩论会上，大家表示要坚决消灭落后苗。有一个社员说得好：“人有病要请医生，配点药吃；稻有病也要诊断，给它药吃，把病治好。”最后，农艺师会同社员们给落后苗开了一张处方：人粪二百七十担，泥灰八百三十担，明矾六百五十斤，“六六六”杀虫粉五十六斤。接着，他们对不同病症的稻苗分别进行了治疗。
