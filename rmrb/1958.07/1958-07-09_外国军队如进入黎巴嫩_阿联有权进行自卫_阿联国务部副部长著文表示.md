Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 7th - Rifaat, the Deputy Minister of State for Presidential Affairs of the United Arab Republic, said in an issue of "Rose al-Yusuf" weekly published today that if any foreign troops enter Lebanon, whether their purpose is to stop the Lebanese revolution or to protect the Chamoun regime without participating in the fighting, it will be considered a direct threat to the United Arab Republic, and the United Arab Republic has the right to self-defense.

He said that the threat of the US Sixth Fleet to the Middle East no longer scares the United Arab Republic, because the conspiracy of British and American imperialists is so obvious that the United Arab Republic is no longer afraid of the "brink of war" policy. He pointed out that the British and Americans themselves are frightened by the Soviet Union's deployment of its fleet in the Baltic Sea.

He also pointed out that Iraq and Jordan have been used by imperialists to destroy the Lebanese revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 7th - "Al-Ahram" pointed out that the recent meeting of the Baghdad Pact Organization representatives in Istanbul was to study the details of the conspiracy to drag Lebanon into the Baghdad Pact. Imperialism is trying to interfere in Lebanon through this organization.

"Al-Shaab" said that imperialism is playing its last card, trying to make Lebanon join the Baghdad Pact Organization in order to crack down on Arab nationalism.

    外国军队如进入黎巴嫩
    阿联有权进行自卫
    阿联国务部副部长著文表示
    据新华社开罗7日电  阿拉伯联合共和国负责总统事务的国务部副部长里法特在今天出版的一期“鲁兹·优素福”周刊中说，任何外国军队如果进入黎巴嫩，不论他们的目的是要制止黎巴嫩的革命还是在不参加战斗的情况下保护夏蒙政权，都将被认为是对阿拉伯联合共和国的直接威胁，阿拉伯联合共和国有权进行自卫。
    他说，美国第六舰队对中东的威胁再也吓不倒阿拉伯联合共和国，因为英美帝国主义者的阴谋已经如此明显，阿拉伯联合共和国再也不怕“战争边缘”政策了。他指出，英美自己已经由于苏联调动在波罗的海的舰队而感到害怕。
    他还指出，伊拉克和约旦已经被帝国主义者利用来摧毁黎巴嫩的革命。
    据新华社开罗7日电  “金字塔报”指出，巴格达条约组织代表最近在伊斯坦布尔举行的会议，是为了研究把黎巴嫩拉进巴格达条约的阴谋细节。帝国主义企图通过这个组织来干涉黎巴嫩。
    “人民报”说，帝国主义正在玩它的最后一张牌，力图使黎巴嫩加入巴格达条约组织，以便打击阿拉伯的民族主义。
