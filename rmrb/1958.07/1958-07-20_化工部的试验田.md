    The Ministry of Chemical Industry's Experimental Field
    This newspaper reports that the Ministry of Chemical Industry's experimental field - a modern phosphate fertilizer plant - has begun construction in Jiliao District, Linru County, Luoyang Prefecture.

    The plant is divided into three workshops and will be completed by early September. Once the plant is fully operational, it will produce 11,300 tons of superphosphate per year. The Ministry of Chemical Industry will summarize the experiences here and promote them throughout the country.
