    Eight Thousand Teachers and Students in Capital Universities and Colleges Conduct In-Depth Discussions on the Middle East Situation
    Recognizing the Essence of Imperialism Strengthening Internationalist Education

    (Our Newspaper News) Over the past few days, eighty thousand teachers and students in the capital's universities and colleges have conducted extensive and in-depth discussions on the Middle East situation. Through these discussions, the broad masses of teachers and students have enhanced their understanding of the Middle East situation, strengthened their internationalist spirit of supporting the independence movements of oppressed nations, and ideologically strengthened their combat readiness against imperialist aggression.

    During the discussions, people criticized the performance of some teachers and students who were simply burying themselves in their professional work and not paying enough attention to the international political situation. Students at Peking University pointed out in their discussions: "Our socialist construction and the Middle East situation are inseparable. The situation in our country is a part of the international situation. Every achievement we make in construction is a blow to imperialism. At the same time, imperialist aggression in the Middle East is a serious threat to our construction. If we do not rise up to stop the imperialist plot of aggression, our construction and learning will not be guaranteed." Song Yufen, a student at Tsinghua University, said: "We are fighting to build a communist Tsinghua University. Although we have to prepare for exams, prepare for production internships, and have a tense factory construction task, a communist should first and foremost be an internationalist and should be concerned about and fully support the struggle of the Middle Eastern people."

    Through the discussions, everyone further recognized the essence of imperialism and deepened their hatred for imperialism. Students in Class 1 of the History Department of Peking University analyzed in detail the specific factors that led imperialism to instigate war. They believe that: the economic crisis of imperialism is forcing imperialism to seek a way out through war, and at the same time, the oil of the Middle East is the lifeblood of imperialism, and the struggle of the Middle Eastern people has severely hit imperialism. Although imperialism's war preparations are not yet complete, it is also possible for it to go mad and make a desperate struggle. The danger of war exists. We have the confidence to defend peace, and at the same time, we must be prepared for battle, and once imperialism launches an aggression, we will send them to their graves. They also proposed to strengthen national defense education and sports activities among students.

    Teachers and students from various schools also discussed the nature of the Iraqi revolution. Everyone believes that the Iraqi revolution is a great victory for the anti-imperialist national independence movement in colonies and semi-colonies. It further proves the international situation of the East wind prevailing over the West wind, and it has set an example for the people of colonies and semi-colonies around the world. Students from the Department of Power Engineering at Tsinghua University pointed out in their discussions: the unity of national independence movements and socialist movements in colonies and semi-colonies against imperialist aggression is an important feature of the current world situation. The people of Iraq are a banner for the people of colonies and semi-colonies around the world.

    The discussions in various schools took various forms such as seminars, debates, and report meetings. All the students of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology are currently expressing their opinions freely on the Middle East issue. Every day when the newspaper comes, they read the newspaper in groups to discuss the development of the situation and how to estimate it. The Political Education Department of Beijing Normal University has established a special group to compile propaganda outlines and materials. Students at the Beijing Foreign Affairs College combined their professional work and each wrote an article on their understanding of the Middle East situation, and organized many groups to study the history of the Middle Eastern people's struggle and the political and economic situation of the Middle Eastern countries, which specifically embodies the policy of education serving politics. The teachers also organized reporters to go to various units to give reports on the Middle East situation. The Communist Youth League organization of Peking University, at the League Congress that began on the 20th, listed the discussion of the Middle East situation as the main topic of the Congress. The Congress passed a telegram to the young students of Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan. The telegram stated: "Friends, your struggle is not isolated, we and more than 100 million young people in China support you. We hold hands and our hearts are connected. Your struggle is our struggle, your victory is our victory! The end of imperialism is coming, and if they dare to provoke, they will surely be battered and bruised. Victory will surely belong to the just and heroic Arab people!"

    首都高等学校八万师生深入讨论中东形势
    认识帝国主义本质  加强国际主义教育
    本报讯  首都高等学校八万师生连日对中东形势进行了广泛和深入的讨论。通过讨论，广大师生提高了对中东形势的认识，加强了支援被压迫民族独立运动的国际主义精神，并从思想上加强了反对帝国主义侵略的战斗准备。
    讨论中大家批判了一部分师生单纯埋头业务对国际政治形势关心不够的表现。北京大学学生在讨论中指出：“我们的社会主义建设和中东形势不可分割，我国的形势就是国际形势的一个部分。我们建设的每一个成就就是对帝国主义的打击，同时，帝国主义对中东的侵略就是对我们建设的严重威胁。如果不起来制止帝国主义的侵略阴谋，我们的建设和学习就得不到保障”。清华大学学生宋玉芬说：“我们正在为建设共产主义的清华大学而斗争，尽管我们要准备考试，准备生产实习，又有紧张的建厂任务，但是做一个共产主义者，首先应当是国际主义者，应当关切和全力支持中东人民的斗争”。
    通过讨论，大家进一步认识到了帝国主义的本质，加深了对帝国主义的仇恨。北京大学历史系二一班学生在讨论中详细分析了帝国主义为什么要策动战争的具体因素。他们认为：帝国主义的经济危机迫使帝国主义从战争寻找出路，同时中东的石油又是帝国主义的命根子，中东人民的斗争狠狠打击了帝国主义。虽然帝国主义的战争准备还没有完成，但是他也有可能发疯、可能作垂死挣扎。战争的危险是存在的，我们有信心保卫和平，同时也要作好战斗准备，一旦帝国主义发动侵略，就把他们送到坟墓里去。他们还提出了要在同学中加强国防教育和体育活动。
    各校师生还讨论了伊拉克革命的性质问题。大家认为伊拉克革命是殖民地半殖民地反帝民族独立运动的巨大胜利。它进一步证明了东风压倒西风的国际形势，并且为全世界殖民地半殖民地人民树立了榜样。清华大学动力系学生在讨论中指出：殖民地半殖民地的民族独立运动和社会主义运动联合起来反对帝国主义侵略，是目前世界形势的一个重要的特点。伊拉克人民是全世界殖民地半殖民地人民的一面旗帜。
    各校讨论采取了座谈会、辩论会、报告会等多种形式。北京钢铁工业学院全校学生正围绕中东问题大鸣大放，每天报纸一来，就分组读报，讨论形势有什么发展，应当如何估计等。北京师范大学政治教育系成立专门小组，编写宣传提纲和资料。北京外交学院学生结合业务每人写一篇对中东形势认识的文章，并组织许多小组研究中东人民斗争的历史、中东国家的政治经济情况，具体体现了教育为政治服务的方针。教师们还组织了报告员到各单位去作有关中东形势的报告。北京大学的共青团组织在20日开始举行的团代表大会上，把讨论中东形势列为大会的主要议题。大会通过了致伊拉克、黎巴嫩、约旦青年学生的通电。电文中说：“朋友们，你们的斗争不是孤立的，我们和全中国一亿多青年都支持你们，我们手牵着手，心连着心。你们的斗争就是我们的斗争，你们的胜利就是我们的胜利！帝国主义的末日就要来了，他们敢于挑衅必定碰得头破血流，胜利一定属于正义的、英勇的阿拉伯人民！”
