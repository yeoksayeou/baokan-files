Consciously Establishing the Opposite

Wu Chuanqi

"Where Does Unanimity of Understanding Come From?" This is the title of a commentary on page 4 of the People's Daily on June 24th. The question is well raised. For example, we are all revolutionary cadres and all want to do things well. This is where we are unified. However, in daily concrete work, in every specific action, and on some specific policies, disagreements are frequently present. Yet, in every specific task, without a unity of understanding, there can be no unified action, resulting in disunity and weakness, and of course, the work cannot be done well. Therefore, we need to constantly achieve temporary unity from frequent disagreements. This raises the question of "Where Does Unanimity of Understanding Come From?"

The reason this question is raised is because there are two different attitudes towards this kind of disagreement: one is to regard this disagreement as an abnormal phenomenon, adopting an attitude of avoidance and reconciliation, not daring to face the opposite, and not letting the opposite unfold its struggle; the other is to regard it as a normal phenomenon, consciously establish the opposite, and let the struggle of the opposite unfold freely. Not daring to face the opposite, hesitating in the face of contradictions, and being in a passive position will of course not resolve contradictions, nor seek a unity of understanding under certain conditions, and will certainly not enhance unity. Conversely, consciously establishing the opposite, thoroughly unfolding the opposite through the methods of big airing, big blooming, and big debate, distinguishing right from wrong, distinguishing correctness from error in the debate, making the correct opinions appear more correct, and the wrong opinions appear more wrong, thereby transforming the original disagreement into a unity of understanding under certain conditions; this will strengthen unity and promote work.

Consciously establishing the opposite is consciously applying materialist dialectics in practical work. The opposite exists objectively, and cannot be established if it does not exist objectively. The opposite is constantly being overcome and constantly being produced. Once the old problem is unified, new problems and disagreements will arise; if there is unity on this issue, disagreements will arise on that issue. Therefore, consciously establishing the opposite is to promote the transformation of contradictions, from the original disagreement to a new unity. The re-emergence and transformation of new disagreements, and so on, is a frequent occurrence in all practical work, which is one reason why we must consciously establish the opposite.

At present, various bourgeois ideologies and idealist ideologies still exist in society. Since they exist objectively, they must be expressed. This creates the opposition between bourgeois ideology and proletarian ideology, between idealism and materialism. If we adopt a method of reconciliation or suppression to prevent bourgeois ideology and idealist ideology from being expressed, then we cannot effectively and truly overcome them, and we cannot achieve the goal of pulling up the white flag and planting the red flag.

For example, the contradiction between the bourgeois rightists and the masses of the people, which is an antagonistic contradiction, is also a social opposite. Since the rightists exist objectively, we consciously established the opposite last summer, allowing them to release their poisonous weeds, and then debated them, refuted them, and completely isolated them, thereby drawing a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, educating 600 million people, and consolidating the socialist system and the unity of the people.

In all our practical work, in all aspects of our production and construction, the opposite between the advanced and the backward universally exists. This opposite also exists objectively. During this year's summer harvest, Xinqixiang Fifth Cooperative in Miaotan Township, Gucheng County, Hubei Province, achieved a high yield record of 5,467 jin of wheat per mu, while at the opposite extreme, there were also low yield records of less than 100 jin per mu. Therefore, in order to further universally increase the yield per unit area, we need not only to summarize and promote the successful experiences of high yields, but also to summarize the failed lessons of low yields, thereby promoting the backward to catch up with the advanced, and transforming low yields into high yields. This is the method of "grasping both ends to bring along the middle." When the backward catches up with the advanced, the old contradiction is overcome; however, if the advanced stagnates there, and more advanced things appear in front of it, the original advanced may be transformed into backward. So we must "grasp" and "bring along" again. Repeating this cycle will surely do the job well.

The methods of socialist emulation and comparison are also a way of establishing the opposite. The Secretary of the Zhaoyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hubei Province put forward the slogan "Cover Sui County" at a meeting convened by the prefectural committee, so Sui County held a broadcast conference of hundreds of thousands of people, determined not to let Zhaoyang "cover" them. One wants to "cover," and the other does not want to be "covered." When the opposite is established, this generates a force that mobilizes the masses, boosts their energy, strives for the top, and launches organized socialist emulation. This kind of consciously establishing the opposite is also a way to mobilize the masses to strive for the top.

The significance of consciously establishing the opposite also lies in: when we recognize what to develop and the direction to develop towards, this sets up a goal for ourselves - the opposite, which can encourage and urge us to boost our energy and strive to achieve it. For example, the goals, leap forward plans, and red-expert plans that people set for themselves are setting up an advanced opposite for themselves. The Changfeng Cooperative in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, put forward the great goal of striving for 10,000 jin of rice per mu, setting up a leap forward opposite for themselves. Of course, this kind of opposite is established on the basis of actual possibilities, and is by no means a fantasy. Recently, many provinces and cities have established theoretical publications. With this opposite established, people are urged to write articles, to summarize practical work experience, and to read and study theory. Thus, the level of theory can be universally improved. Therefore, consciously establishing the opposite is to consciously establish a goal for progress. A revolutionary should always pay attention to continuous revolution wave after wave. When a revolutionary goal is achieved and the original opposite is overcome, a new goal and a new opposite should be immediately established. This is the only way to maintain a vigorous revolutionary will, high spirits, and lofty aspirations; only then can we achieve one victory after another. Without this new opposite, people's thinking is prone to stagnation, and the revolutionary cause will also stagnate. That is to say, being good at consciously establishing the opposite can enable people to always be promoters in the revolutionary cause, and can enable the revolution to proceed victoriously one after another.

There is also an opposite that has not yet appeared, but is consciously set up by people according to the laws of objective development. In the struggle between man and nature, this kind of opposite is constantly being set up. The establishment of this kind of opposite must have corresponding material conditions, otherwise it is impossible. Launching man-made satellites into space is a kind of artificially set up opposite. Building dams, raising water levels to create a drop, in order to irrigate, generate electricity, store water, and navigate, is also an artificially set up opposite. The establishment of this kind of opposite lies in seeking welfare for mankind, turning the useless into the useful, turning water hazards into water conservancy, and promoting the transformation of contradictions.

Therefore, consciously establishing the opposite is the conscious and concrete application of materialist dialectics in practical work, which is to correctly understand objective contradictions and correctly deal with contradictions. Contradictions are universally present and run through the entire development process of every specific thing. Chairman Mao said, "The contradictory opposites are both united and struggling, thereby promoting the movement and change of things." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") The opposite sides are interdependent and transform into each other under certain conditions. We must consciously establish the opposite, which is to correctly understand contradictions, expose contradictions, and unfold the struggle between the opposite sides; that is, to be good at using and creating certain specific conditions to promote the transformation of contradictions.

    有意识地树立对立面
    吴传启
   “一致的认识从哪里来？”这是人民日报6月24日四版一篇评论的标题。这个问题提得很好。比如说，我们都是革命干部，都想把事情办好，这一点是一致的。但是，在日常的具体工作中，在每一项具体行动中，以及在一些具体的方针政策上，则意见的不一致又是经常存在的。可是在每一项具体工作上，没有认识上的一致，就不能产生一致的行动，就会涣散无力，当然就不能把工作做好。所以我们又需要从经常的不一致中不断取得暂时的一致。由此就提出了“一致的认识从哪里来”的问题。
    为什么提出了这样的问题，就因为对待这种不一致的认识，有两种不同的态度：一种是把这种不一致看作反常现象，采取回避和调和的态度，不敢正视对立面，不放手让对立面展开斗争；另一种则是把它看作正常的现象，有意识地树立对立面，放手展开对立面的斗争。不敢正视对立面，在矛盾面前缩手缩脚，处于消极被动地位，当然就不能解决矛盾，不能求得在一定条件下的认识一致，也就决不能增进团结。反之，有意识地树立对立面，通过大鸣、大放、大辩论的方式把对立面彻底展开，在辩论中分清是非，分清正确与错误，让正确的意见更加显得正确，让错误的意见更加显得错误，从而使原来的不一致转化为在一定条件下的认识一致；这样就会使团结得到加强，工作得到推进。
    有意识地树立对立面，也就是在实际工作中自觉地运用唯物主义辩证法。对立面是客观存在的，客观上不存在是树立不起来的。对立面又是不断被克服而又不断产生的。旧的问题一致了，新的问题又会出现不一致；在这个问题上一致了，在那个问题上又会出现不一致。因此有意识地树立对立面，乃是为了促进矛盾的转化，从原来的不一致转化为新的一致。新的不一致再发生，再转化，如此循环往复，是一切实际工作中经常发生的事情，这就是我们为什么要有意识地树立对立面的一个原因。
    目前，在社会上还存在着各种资产阶级思想和唯心主义思想，既然它们是客观存在的，就一定要表现出来。由此便存在着资产阶级思想和无产阶级思想，唯心主义和唯物主义之间的对立。如果采取调和或者用压制的办法不让资产阶级思想和唯心主义思想表现出来，那末就不能有效地和真正地克服它，就不能达到拔白旗插红旗的目的。
    例如资产阶级右派同人民大众之间的敌我矛盾，也是一种社会的对立面。右派是客观存在的，所以我们在去年夏季以来，有意识地树立起对立面，让他们把毒草放出来，然后同他们辩论，把他们驳倒，使他们彻底孤立起来，从而划清了敌我界线，教育了六亿人民，巩固了社会主义制度和人民内部的团结。
    在我们的一切实际工作中，在我们的生产和建设的各方面，还普遍存在着先进与落后之间的对立面。这种对立面也是客观存在的。今年的夏收中，湖北谷城县庙滩乡新气象五社出现了小麦亩产五千四百六十七斤的高产纪录，与此相对立的另一极，还有亩产百斤以下的低产纪录。因此如要进一步普遍提高单位面积产量，就不仅需要总结和推广高产的成功经验，而且也要总结低产的失败教训，从而促使落后赶上先进，使低产变高产。这就是“抓两头带中间”的方法。落后赶上了先进，旧的矛盾就克服了；但是，先进的如若就此停滞不前，在它面前出现了更先进的以后，原来先进的又可能转化为落后。于是就要再“抓”再“带”。如此循环往复，就一定能把工作做好。
    社会主义竞赛和评比的方法，同样是一种树立对立面的方法。中共湖北枣阳县委书记在地委召开的会议上提出了“盖随县”的口号，于是随县就开了几十万人的广播大会，决心不叫枣阳“盖”。一个要“盖”，一个不叫“盖”，对立面树起来了，这就产生了一种力量，动员群众，鼓足干劲，力争上游，展开了组织社会主义竞赛。这样有意识地树立对立面，也是一种动员群众力争上游的方法。
    有意识地树立对立面的意义，还在于：当我们认识到要发展什么以及向哪里发展的方向后，这就给自己树立了前进的目标——对立面，这也就能够鼓励、督促我们鼓足干劲，努力去实现它。比如人们为自己制定的奋斗目标，跃进计划，红专规划等等，就是为自己树立了先进的对立面。湖北孝感县长风社，提出了力争水稻亩产万斤的伟大目标，他们就给自己树立起来一个跃进的对立面。当然这种对立面是在实际可能的基础上树立的，决不是空想。最近许多省市都创办了理论刊物，这个对立面树立起来了，就促使人们要写文章，要去总结实际工作经验，要读书和研究理论。于是理论水平就可以普遍提高了。因此，有意识地设立对立面，也就是要自觉地设立前进的目标。一个革命者，应当经常注意到一浪接一浪地不断革命。一个革命的目标达到了，原来的对立面克服了，就应当马上设立一个新的目标，新的对立面。如此才能保持革命意志旺盛，精神奋发，志气昂扬；才能一个胜利接着一个胜利。而没有这种新的对立面，人们的思想就容易僵化，革命事业也会停滞不前。这就是说，善于有意识地树立对立面，可以使人们在革命事业中永远做促进派，可以使革命一个接一个胜利地进行下去。
    也有一种对立面是原来还没有出现，而是人们根据客观发展的规律自觉地设置的。在人同自然界的斗争中，就不断设置着这种对立面。设立这种对立面，必须具备相应的物质条件，否则也是不可能的。把人造卫星发射上天，就是一种人工设置的对立面。我们修拦河坝，抬高水位造成落差，借以灌溉、发电、蓄水和行船，也是一种人工设置的对立面。这种对立面的设立，在于为人类谋福利，变无用为有用，变水患为水利，促使矛盾转化。
    所以说，有意识地树立对立面，就是唯物主义辩证法在实际工作中的自觉地具体的运用，就是要正确地认识客观矛盾并正确地对待矛盾。矛盾是普遍存在的，并贯穿于每一具体事物发展过程的始终。毛主席说，“矛盾着的对立面又统一，又斗争，由此推动事物的运动和变化。”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）对立面之间互相依存，而又在一定条件下互相转化。我们要有意识地树立对立面，就是要正确地认识矛盾，揭露矛盾，展开对立面之间的斗争；也就是要善于利用和创造一定的具体条件，来促使矛盾的转化。
