    Steel Bridge

    I
    The Highway Bureau Chief and the engineer stood together on a precipitous rock, below them the foaming spray of the stream, and opposite them a jutting cliff.
    "Look, when can the bridge be built?" the Bureau Chief asked.
    "Three months," the engineer bit his lip and said with determination.
    "Can't it be faster?" the Bureau Chief asked, staring intently.
    "This is a steel bridge! It's not a pontoon bridge," the engineer felt that this leading comrade was taking everything too simply.
    "I've built pontoon bridges. When I was a sapper, I built a half-li long pontoon bridge in just three minutes!"
      "But a steel bridge is, after all, a steel bridge!"
    "Precisely because it's a steel bridge, I'm giving you three days."
    "Three days?!" If he weren't standing on this dangerous rock, the engineer would have jumped up.
    "Three days," the Bureau Chief's words were like a knife cut, as if he couldn't give even a second more.
    "But there are no rivets! It'll take at least three weeks to transport the rivets from the interior."
    The engineer squeezed his brows tightly, raising an insurmountable problem.
    The Bureau Chief pondered for a moment—his thought process was always very fast: a tangled mess, in his mind, would be untangled into a rope in just a few seconds. He replied, "Tomorrow, tomorrow I'll give you the rivets!"
    Tomorrow?! The engineer was stunned. Heavens! This was even more magical than borrowing arrows with straw boats.
    II
    The Bureau Chief returned to his old unit. He could name almost all the officers in this engineering regiment. He could even remember who joined the army in which year; who fought a beautiful battle in which year; who was emotional in which year. ...He used to be their political commissar. Now, wearing a dark and light blue cloth uniform, he stood among them.
    The officers' emotions were boiling—the old leader had suddenly arrived.
    The Bureau Chief sat on the bellows by the tent, saying with great interest: "No visit without a reason. I'm not here to issue orders, I'm here to make a request, to see if it can be done?"
      "Yes!" The regimental commander standing beside him replied loudly.
    When the Bureau Chief was the regimental commander, this regimental commander was an outstanding sharp knife company commander. No matter what difficult task he was given, he always answered with this "Yes" first, and then thought about it—unlike some people, who thought it through first and then answered.
    This familiar answer made the Bureau Chief even happier: "Who among you knows how to blacksmith?"
      "I!" The officers shouted loudly, as if answering a command.
    "Who has worked in the cooling department?"
    "I!" Several more company and platoon leaders answered enthusiastically.
    "Who has been a riveter?"
    "I!" Only one high-pitched voice remained—it was a robust political instructor.
    In fact, the Bureau Chief's words were somewhat knowingly asked, he was very clear about the background, composition, and origins of these old subordinates.
    "Good, I now hire you as our technical advisor."
    After the Bureau Chief finished speaking to the political instructor, he stood in front of the regimental commander again, the regimental commander almost held his breath—he knew the old leader's habit, when assigning a difficult task, he always liked to approach you, to stand in front of you.
      "Thank you, let's fight another surprise attack! Please assemble the troops immediately, and repeat what I just said to you to the soldiers—tell the comrades who have been riveters to stand forward: Take one step forward!" …
    III
    That night, the entire valley was brightly lit, and the entire sky was red. Everywhere there was the sound of pulling bellows, the clanging of blacksmithing. In short, this ancient, uninhabited deep mountain wilderness was truly extraordinarily lively tonight.
    The next day, just as a few thin clouds in the sky were dyed red by the sun, the Bureau Chief came to knock on the engineer's tent. The engineer rubbed his eyes and saw rivet after rivet, just out of the furnace, pile after pile of sparkling rivets, placed at his bedside, making the engineer tongue-tied, not knowing what to say.
    Communist Youth League members climbed up and down the steel beams, Communist Party members sprayed electric welding sparks in mid-air, all the officers, soldiers, and Highway Bureau technicians, did not take a second of leisure, did not take an hour of sleep, and worked in one breath for three days and three nights. Finally, on the morning of the fourth day, a steel bridge spanned the rushing stream, lying flat between the jagged rocks and the cliff. The convoy that had been stranded here for a long time steadily drove past, one after another.
    The Highway Bureau Chief stood on that dangerous rock again, staring intently at the endless stream of vehicles at his feet. After a moment, he turned his face to the engineer and said:
    "I think building such steel bridges in the future can be brought forward another twelve hours!"
    This time, although there were still many question marks and exclamation points in the engineer's mind, he couldn't explain any reason verbally.

    钢桥
    顾工
    一
    公路局长和工程师一起站在一块险峻的石岩上，脚下是白沫喷溅的涧水，对面是一块突兀的悬崖。
    “你看，桥什么时候能够搭起来？”局长问。
    “三个月”，工程师咬着嘴唇，狠了狠心说。
    “不能再快点吗？”局长逼视着问。
    “这是钢桥啊！这不是浮桥，”工程师总觉得这位领导同志把一切问题看得太简单。
    “我搭过浮桥，我当工兵的时候，搭一道半华里长的浮桥，只用了三分钟！”
      “可是钢桥究竟是钢桥啊！”
    “正因为是钢桥，所以我才给你三天的时间。”
    “三天？！”若不是站在这块险峻的石岩上，工程师真会跳起脚来的。
    “三天”，局长的话，像刀切似地，似乎一秒钟也不能再多给。
    “可是没有铆钉啊！铆钉从内地运到这里，起码就得三个星期。”
    工程师紧挤着眉头，提出了不可克服的难题。
    局长沉吟了一下——他的思考过程总是很快的：一堆乱麻，在他的脑子里，只要几秒钟的时间就缕成了绳子。他回答：“明天，明天我就把铆钉交给你！”
    明天？！工程师呆住了。咳！这简直比草船借箭还神奇。
    二
    局长回到他的老部队来了。这个工兵团里的军官，他差不多都能叫出名字来。他还能记住谁是在那年参军的；谁在那年打过一个漂亮仗；谁在那年闹过情绪。……他当过他们的政委。现在，他穿着一身深一块、浅一块的蓝布衣服，站在他们中间。
    军官们的情绪都沸腾起来——老首长突然来到了。
    局长坐在帐篷边的风箱上，意趣横生地说：“无事不登三宝殿，我现在不是来下达命令，我是来提出一点请求，看看能不能办到？”
      “能！”站在他边上的团长响亮地回答。
    在局长当团长的时候，这位团长是出色的尖刀连连长。无论交代他一个什么艰险的任务，他总是先回答了这个“能”字，然后再去考虑——他不同于有些人，先考虑好了，再来回答。
    这个熟悉的回答，使局长更加高兴：“你们谁会打铁？”
      “我！”军官们就像回答口令一样，大声地喊着。
    “谁在冷却部工作过？”
    “我！”又有几个连、排长振奋地答应。
    “谁当过铆工？”
    “我！”只剩下一个高亢的声音了——是一位精精壮壮的指导员。
    其实，局长这些话都有些明知故问，他对这些老部下的出身、成份、来龙去脉是很清楚的。
    “好，我现在就聘请你作我们的技术顾问。”
    局长对指导员说完这句话，又站到团长的面前，团长几乎屏住了气息——他知道这位老首长的习惯，在交代一个艰巨的任务的时候，他总是喜欢靠近你，站到你的面前。
      “谢谢你，再来打个突击战吧！请你马上集合部队，照我刚才对你们说过的话，再对战士们说一遍——叫当过铆工的同志站出来：向前一步走！”……
    三
    这天夜里，整个山谷都是明晃晃的，整个天空都是红艳艳的。到处都是拉风箱的声音，叮叮当当的打铁的声音。总之，这个旷古无人的深山野岭，今夜真是热闹非凡。
    第二天，天上一两片薄云刚刚被阳光染红，局长就来拍打工程师住的帐篷了。工程师揉开眼睛，就见一颗一颗才出炉的铆钉，一堆一堆晶晶亮亮的铆钉，放到他的床头了，弄得这位工程师张口结舌，实在不知说些什么才好。
    共青团员在钢梁上爬上爬下，共产党员在半空中喷着电焊的火花，所有的军官、战士和公路局的技工，没有一秒钟的偷闲，没有一小时的睡眠，一口气干了三天三夜。终于，在第四天的早晨，一座钢桥，就横跨在湍急的涧水上面，就平卧在巉岩和悬崖的中间。在这里滞留已久的车队，一辆接着一辆平稳地行驶过去了。
    公路局长又站到那块险峻的岩石上，出神地望着在脚跟前川流不息的车队。片刻，他又斜过脸来对工程师说：
    “我看以后架这样的钢桥，还可以再提前十二个小时！”
    这回，工程师的心里虽然还有不少的问号和惊叹号，可是在口头上却什么道理都讲不出来了。
