Xinhua News Agency, London, July 15th. Paul Robeson tonight in London's Aldephi Theater praised the performance of the Chinese Drama and Song and Dance Troupe.

Paul Robeson and his wife, after watching the performance, went on stage to pay tribute to the Chinese artists. The great singer said, "This is one of the most rewarding nights of artistic appreciation in my life. From the bottom of my heart, I express my deepest gratitude for your extremely outstanding performance."

Robeson said this was the first time he had seen a Chinese theatrical performance. He said, "I have heard many discussions about Chinese theatrical art and have read many articles on the subject, but I never expected them to be so beautiful and moving."

Robeson said that he was deeply impressed by "the entire artistic design of the performance from beginning to end, and the wonderful unity of music, dance, and performance." He said, "It's truly unbelievable."

He said that he liked Chinese singing and music, especially the pentatonic Erhu melody, which is similar to Hebridean music or to African music with which he is particularly familiar.

Robeson spoke to all the members of the Drama and Song and Dance Troupe with great excitement. He said, "I hope that one day soon I will see you again in your China, which is also my beloved China."

Robeson sang an old Chinese folk song with a distinctly Chinese flavor in his deep and sonorous voice.

Qu Wu, the head of the Chinese Drama and Song and Dance Troupe, introduced Robeson to the troupe members, saying that he was a great artist and singer in the world, and also a banner of the peace movement. Qu Wu said amidst cheers and applause, "He is a great and loyal friend of the 600 million Chinese people."

The entire backstage area presented a moving scene filled with the friendship of Chinese and American artists. They shook hands, embraced, cheered, applauded, sang, and presented bouquets. Paul Robeson and the Chinese artists had to communicate through interpreters. But in such a great moment, when conveying mutual understanding and friendship, spoken language often becomes unimportant.

    美国歌手向中国歌手致意
    罗伯逊在伦敦同我歌舞团亲切会见
    新华社伦敦15日电　保罗·罗伯逊今晚在伦敦中区阿尔德菲剧院极力赞扬中国戏剧歌舞团的表演。
    保罗·罗伯逊和他的夫人在看过表演后登上舞台，向中国艺术家们致意。这位伟大的歌手说：“这是我一生中最难得的欣赏艺术的夜晚之一。我从心底对你们极其卓越的表演表示最深刻的感谢。”
    罗伯逊说，这是他第一次看到中国戏剧表演。他说，“我曾经听到过许多有关中国戏剧艺术的谈论，并且读过许多这方面的文章，但是我却不曾料到它们竟然会这样美妙动人。”
    罗伯逊说，“表演自始至终的整个艺术设计以及音乐、舞蹈和表演的绝妙的统一”给了他以极为深刻的印象。他说，“这真是难以置信”。
    他说，他喜欢中国歌唱和音乐，特别是五音阶的二胡旋律，这种旋律同赫布里底音乐或者同他所特别熟悉的非洲音乐很相似。
    罗伯逊非常兴奋地对戏剧歌舞团全体团员讲了话。他说：“我希望不久有一天会在你们的中国、同时也是我的可爱的中国再看到你们。”
    罗伯逊用他深沉而雄浑的歌声唱了一支十足中国味的古老中国民歌。
    中国戏剧歌舞团团长屈武向歌舞团团员介绍了罗伯逊，说他是世界上伟大的艺术家和歌唱家，又是和平运动的旗帜。屈武在欢呼声和掌声中说：“他是六亿中国人民的伟大的、忠实的朋友。”
    整个后台呈现出一幅中国和美国的艺术家友情洋溢的动人场面。他们握手，拥抱，欢呼，鼓掌，唱歌和赠送花束。保罗·罗伯逊和中国艺术家们不得不通过译员进行谈话。但是在像这样的伟大时刻，当传达彼此的了解和友情的时候，口头语言往往变得很不重要了。
