    The Iron Facts
    These days, it feels like I've lost something precious if I don't read the newspaper for a day. Isn't that right? When I saw the news that the Satellite Cooperative achieved a wheat yield of 3,530 jin per mu, I was so happy that I told everyone I met. But just two days later, the good news of the Xingguang Cooperative's yield of 4,353 jin per mu came. However, my excited mood had not yet calmed down, and the good news of the Henan Shuanglou Cooperative's yield of 4,412 jin per mu arrived. Who dares to say that this is the highest record? There are also the active dyes that have already surpassed England and become the world's number one; there is also the vigorously developing local industry; and there is the constant emergence of native experts who break superstitions and fear nothing... Who can not be ecstatic about all this?
    I wonder what those right-wingers who say "socialism has no superiority" and "agricultural cooperation has messed things up," as well as those "wait-and-see" types who currently do not believe that China's agriculture can develop at high speed, think after seeing these mythical miracles? These are iron facts, beyond doubt!

    A Good Newsletter
    I was deeply moved after reading the report "One Day of Wheat Harvest" on the second page of the People's Daily on June 8th. This article vividly and timely reflected the scene of the first harvest after the great leap forward in the countryside; it depicted the joyful mood of the peasants, as well as the meticulous care and leadership of the Party and the government for agricultural production. The title and illustrations of this article are also very lively, which can further deepen the reader's impression. I hope to be able to read such newsletters often.

    Publish More Good Experiences in Propaganda Work
    The People's Daily introduced the experience of the Socialist Education Network in Wuting Village, Wanrong County, Shanxi Province on June 10th. The Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China dispatched a visiting delegation (led by Deputy Minister Shi Xizhi, composed of thirty cadres responsible for propaganda work at all levels of the Party and the Communist Youth League) to Wuting Village in mid-June to visit and learn from the experience of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee in carrying out propaganda and education work.
    In order to consolidate the achievements of the rectification campaign in the countryside and to do a thorough and meticulous job in publicizing and educating about the general line of socialist construction, I hope that newspapers will introduce more experiences in this area in the future.

    An Incorrect Statement
    In the news "Central State Organs Carry Out Red and Expert Debate" on the fourth page of the People's Daily on June 17th, the fourth subheading and the paragraph below both contain the sentence "'Middle-of-the-road stance' is the ideological source of bourgeois individualism." I think this statement is flawed. It can be seen from that paragraph that all kinds of "content to be in the middle" arguments, that is, a "middle-of-the-road stance," are manifestations of bourgeois individualism, but by no means the ideological source of bourgeois individualism. The above statement obviously reverses the ideological source with its manifestation.

    Everyone Should Eliminate Errors
    We welcome the People's Daily's acceptance of readers' criticisms and the launching of an error elimination campaign in the entire editorial department. In fact, other newspapers have also made many mistakes. For example, the Hebei Daily published Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on May 27th, and there were two errors on the second page alone: "socialism" was mistaken for "socilism production," and "drainage and irrigation machinery" was mistaken for "irrigation machinery." I think this is an extremely unserious work attitude. Therefore, I suggest that all newspapers take measures to eliminate errors.

    铁的事实
    这些天来，如有一天不看报纸，那简直就像丢了什么宝贝似的。不是吗？当我看到卫星社小麦亩产三千五百三十斤的消息，高兴得到处对别人说的时候，刚过了两天，星光社亩产四千三百五十三斤的喜讯就传来了。可是我的激动的心情还没有平静下去，河南双楼社亩产四千四百一十二斤的捷报又传来了。谁又敢肯定这是最高的纪录呢？还有那已经赶过英国、跃居世界第一位的活性染料；还有那蓬蓬勃勃发展着的地方工业；还有那打破迷信、天不怕地不怕的土专家的不断出现……这一切，谁能不为之欢欣若狂呢？
    不知那些说“社会主义没有优越性”、“农业合作化搞糟了”的右派分子，以及目前那些不相信中国农业能够高速度发展的“观潮派”，在看了这些神话般的奇迹后作何感想？这是铁的事实，不容怀疑！

    一篇好通讯
    我读了6月8日人民日报第二版“麦收一日”的报道，深受感动。这篇文章生动地及时地反映了农村大跃进后第一次丰收的景象；描绘了农民们的喜悦情绪，以及党和政府对农业生产的无微不至的关怀和领导。这篇文章的标题和插图也很生动活泼，因此更能加深读者的印象。希望能够经常读到这样的通讯。

    多登宣传工作的好经验
    6月10日人民日报介绍了山西省万荣县乌停村社会主义教育网的经验。中共河北省委宣传部已于6月中旬派出访问团（由副部长时习之率领，由各级党、团宣传工作负责干部三十人组成）去乌停村进行访问参观，并学习山西省委开展宣传教育工作的经验。
    为了巩固农村整风成果，并深入细致地做好社会主义建设总路线的宣传教育工作，希望报纸今后多介绍这方面的经验。

    一个错误的提法
    6月17日人民日报第四版“中央国家机关开展红专大辩论”这条新闻中，第四个插题和下面一段文字中，均有“‘中间立场’是资产阶级个人主义的思想根源”的句子。我认为这个提法是有毛病的。从那一段文字中可以看出，种种“甘居中游”的论调，也即“中间立场”，都是资产阶级个人主义的表现，而绝不是资产阶级个人主义的思想根源。上面的提法，显然是把思想根源同它的表现颠倒过来了。

    大家都来消灭错误
    人民日报接受读者批评，在全编辑部开展一个消灭错误的运动，这样做我们表示欢迎。事实上，其他报纸也曾出现过不少差错。如5月27日河北日报登载刘少奇同志所作的报告，仅在第二版上，即有两处错误：“社会主义”错成“社主义产”，“排灌机械”错成“排溉机械”。我觉得这是一种极不严肃的工作态度。因此，我建议各报都能够采取措施消灭错误。
