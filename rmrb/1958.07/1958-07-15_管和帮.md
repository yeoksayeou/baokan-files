    Control and Help
    Yu Yan, Director of the Handan City Urban Construction Bureau

    Urban construction management is an important task to realize urban planning and guide urban construction according to urban plans. Handan City has done a lot of work in this area since 1953, such as allocating construction land, reviewing the density, layout, structure, number of floors of civil buildings, and the location, direction, and elevation of various pipeline networks. It has basically achieved the goal of planned urban construction and mastered the principle of inward-outward, filling-in, and compact development. However, in the past few years, there have been many shortcomings in urban construction management, the most prominent of which is the long-term unresolved phenomenon of disputes between urban construction management units and construction units. This kind of dispute is manifested in all aspects such as land allocation location, land use indicators, building floors, building density, and layout. Construction units often emphasize their own requirements and difficulties, regardless of the requirements of urban planning and the rules and regulations of urban construction management; while urban construction management departments often ignore the requirements and difficulties of construction units, disregard the current economic conditions of the country, and regardless of whether the plan is realistic or not, emphasize that the plan is the overall interest and must be unconditionally obeyed. Therefore, the two sides often argue endlessly, affecting the progress of construction. In 1956, when the construction task was extremely tight, we were entangled in this kind of dispute with several construction units, wasting valuable time, and some problems even developed to the point where the secretary of the municipal party committee had to personally intervene to solve them.

    The municipal party committee has repeatedly made severe criticisms of this dispute phenomenon. On the one hand, the municipal party committee criticized some construction units for not obeying government management and unilaterally emphasizing unit interests regardless of the overall situation, thereby facilitating the management work. On the other hand, it also criticized the management units for purely managing and restricting, for their unclear understanding of serving production and construction, and for not considering the specific circumstances of the construction units, thereby raising our ideological awareness. In the rectification movement, we further examined the urban construction management work and realized that we must not only clarify our service to production and construction ideologically, but also make corresponding improvements in work content, work methods, and work style. Therefore, we proposed to implement the principle of "both control and help, combining control and help" in urban construction management, in order to fundamentally improve the relationship between management departments and construction units and accelerate the development of construction. The great leap forward in industrial construction has made this principle even more imperative. Handan is a region with rich coal and iron ore resources and abundant agricultural products, and has extremely favorable conditions for industrial development. It is now estimated that the investment in industrial construction during the Second Five-Year Plan period will be several times greater than during the First Five-Year Plan period, and Handan City will become an important steel, coal, textile, and building materials industrial base in Hebei Province in a very short period of time. According to this plan, many important industrial projects will begin construction in the city in 1958. This rapidly developing situation of industrial construction requires urban construction management to keep up closely. The management department and the construction unit can no longer argue, but should cooperate with each other and work together to implement the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism." Therefore, we organized a great leap forward in urban construction management work by implementing the principle of "both control and help, combining control and help."

    How to implement the principle of "both control and help, combining control and help"? We focused on the following three aspects of work:

    First, actively provide design data and help construction units accelerate the speed of construction. In order to determine urban planning, urban construction management departments collect data on the current status of the city, topography, geology, regional resources, water supply and drainage, and public utilities. This data is also an indispensable basis for construction units to carry out engineering design. However, because we only considered the needs of planning when collecting data in the past, and did not consider the needs of design at the same time, the data was not comprehensive and systematic enough. Moreover, because the data management personnel often regarded providing design data to construction units as a burden, our data was not effectively used to promote the development of construction. Construction units still need to carry out their own surveys and explorations, and re-collect data. This is both time-consuming and costly. If the urban construction management department enriches and provides the existing data to the construction unit, it will save both time and money. Therefore, we actively listed this work as a task of the urban construction management department and provided data to various construction units and design units. As a result, good results have been achieved, which has not only strengthened the relationship between management departments and construction units, but also promoted the progress of capital construction. For example, the factory design of Handan Iron and Steel United Plant, after we actively provided data, they believed that it could be advanced by more than half a year compared with the usual factory construction speed. During the Great Leap Forward this year, more than a dozen other projects with fixed factory sites were also designed and constructed based on the data provided by the urban construction management department, which unprecedentedly accelerated the speed of factory construction and design. At the same time, we also actively provide planning data such as the quota requirements for planning management, so that the design unit can design according to the planning requirements, avoiding the rework and waste of design that must be modified due to the discrepancy between design and planning.

    Second, organize collaboration in construction. There are many problems that need to be solved collaboratively in capital construction. Taking the problems related to urban construction management as an example, there are land requisition, demolition and compensation for ground objects, sharing and co-construction of facilities, use and storage of earthwork, simplification of various management procedures, and so on. In this regard, we have carried out some collaborative organizational work, and have also achieved good results. For example, the hotel building project constructed by the city service company failed to solve the problem of demolishing twenty dilapidated houses last year, and the address was changed three times, and the construction period was delayed by more than two months. This year, this building was transferred to another unit due to unsuitable location, and it was rebuilt near the railway station, which also required the demolition of more than twenty dilapidated houses. This time, with our active help in organizing the demolition of residents, it was not only carried out smoothly, but also greatly reduced the demolition compensation costs. The service company originally had many opinions on us during several site selection changes, but because we finally helped them solve the problem, their dissatisfaction turned into satisfaction. The thermal power plant wanted to erect eight pairs of dedicated communication lines, so we organized the city telephone bureau to cooperate with them, and added eight pairs of city telephone line positions on the same line, which not only saved investment, but also avoided the situation of multiple lines interfering with each other. The Iron and Steel United Plant needs to store a large amount of earthwork, which is estimated to occupy 100 mu of farmland. Coincidentally, the railway engineering office needs a similar amount of earthwork, so we organized both parties to cooperate and reached an agreement, each of which can save half of the investment, and can reduce or not occupy farmland. In the past, construction units also had a headache, that is, there were many leaders, and a construction project often needed to contact many leading agencies to finalize the plan, which delayed the time. For example, the health department has to manage environmental sanitation, the public security department has to manage the air defense distance, and the cultural department has to manage the preservation of historical sites. We actively contacted various units, organized meetings, and used the method of signing the minutes to solve these problems. In short, there are many problems that need to be solved collaboratively in capital construction. We actively do things for which the responsibility is unclear, or the construction unit has difficulties, and the government department needs to come forward to solve.

    Third, take the initiative to visit and participate in site selection and planning and design work. In the past, the site selection work for large construction projects was organized jointly. However, the site selection work for smaller factories and civil buildings was mostly carried out by the units themselves, and they applied for land allocation after finding a suitable location. In this way, the choice of address often does not meet the requirements of the plan, forming a dispute phenomenon. Now we have changed this approach, actively assisting in site selection, and some even visit the door, according to the planning requirements, propose locations, introduce conditions, and jointly conduct on-site inspections to determine. In this way, not only the requirements of the plan are implemented, but also the time for construction units to blindly find locations is reduced, and the construction site is selected quickly. This method is also used for the design of large neighborhoods. The site selection work for the living area of the Iron and Steel United Plant was done jointly by the construction unit and the management department, and the result was satisfactory to both parties. For small-scale construction projects that do not require design or use standard drawings, if the construction unit cannot do the layout by itself, we will help them do it so that the problem can be solved quickly.

    The work in these three aspects has achieved three effects: accelerating the progress of capital construction, realizing the requirements of urban planning, and strengthening the relationship between management and construction units. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary and correct to implement the principle of "both control and help, combining control and help" in urban construction management. It is an important measure to further implement the principle of urban construction serving industrial production, overcome subjectivism and bureaucracy in urban construction management, and improve the work methods and work style of management personnel.

    To implement the principle of "both control and help, combining control and help," it is necessary to pay attention to solving ideological problems. We encountered many ideological obstacles when implementing this principle. For example, some comrades believe that the Urban Construction Bureau is a state agency and an administrative management institution, and implementing the principle of "both control and help, combining control and help" will change the nature of the management department. Some comrades believe that since the contradiction between management and being managed objectively exists, the dispute phenomenon is inevitable, and therefore propose "Don't be afraid of disputes, but learn to argue." Some comrades also believe that control and help belong to two different types of work, which cannot be combined. If you want to control, you cannot help, and helping will not strengthen management work. For these ideological obstacles, we must not only use facts to criticize, but also solve them from the perspective of theoretical understanding. In the discussion, we guided everyone to recognize that state organs are superstructures, and superstructures must serve the economic base. Of course, the Urban Construction Bureau is no exception. The Urban Construction Bureau manages urban construction in order to promote production and construction and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results; helping construction units in the process of management not only does not contradict the purpose of management, but also can better achieve the purpose of management. At the same time, we also guided everyone to recognize that the contradiction between management and being managed is also a kind of internal contradiction among the people, which can be completely resolved, and disputes should be avoided and can be completely avoided. The solution of these ideological problems is the idea of ​​implementing "both control and help, combining control and help," so that urban construction management work can better serve industrial construction.

    管和帮
    邯郸市城市建设局局长　于岩
    城市建设的管理工作，是实现城市规划，根据城市规划来指导城市建设的一项重要工作，邯郸市从1953年开始在这方面做了不少工作，如划拨建筑用地，对民用建筑的密度、平面布置、结构、层数和各种管网线路的位置、走向、标高进行审查，基本上实现了有计划地建设城市的目的，掌握了由内向外、填空补白、紧凑发展的方针。但几年来，在城市建设管理工作中也存在不少缺点，其中最突出的，是城市建设管理单位同建设单位的扯皮现象长期没有解决。这种扯皮，表现在拨地位置、用地指标、建筑层数、建筑密度，平面布置等各个方面。建设单位往往强调本身的要求，强调自己的困难，而不顾城市规划的要求，不遵守城市建设管理的规章制度；而城市建设管理部门又常常忽视建设单位的要求和困难，不考虑国家当前的经济条件，不管规划是否切合实际，强调规划就是整体利益，必须无条件服从。因而，双方常常争执不休，影响到建设的进度。1956年正当建设任务极其紧张的时候，我们就曾同几个建设单位纠缠在这种扯皮现象里，浪费了宝贵的时间，有些问题甚至发展到非市委书记亲自出马不能解决。
    对于这种扯皮现象，市委曾多次提出严厉的批评。市委一方面批判了某些建设单位不服从政府管理，片面强调单位利益不管整体的现象，从而便利了管理工作的进行。另一方面也批判了管理单位单纯的管理、限制，对服务于生产建设的思想不明确，不考虑建设单位的具体情况等现象，从而提高了我们的思想认识。在整风运动中，我们进一步检查了城市建设管理工作，认识到不仅要在思想上明确为生产建设服务，而且在工作内容，工作方法和工作作风上也要有相应的改进，于是便提出在城市建设管理工作中实行又管又帮、管和帮相结合的方针，以便从根本上来改善管理部门和建设单位的关系，加快建设事业的发展。工业建设的大跃进，更使这个方针势在必行。邯郸是一个拥有丰富的煤、铁矿资源和富饶的农产品的地区，有着发展工业的极其有利的条件。现在估计，第二个五年计划期间工业建设的投资将比第一个五年计划期间增长几倍，邯郸市在很短的时间内就会成为河北省一个重要的钢铁、煤炭、纺织和建筑材料工业基地。根据这个计划，1958年全市将有许多重要的工业项目开始建设。这种工业建设迅速发展的形势，要求城市建设管理工作紧紧地跟上去。管理部门和建设单位再也不能扯皮，而应彼此协作，共同努力，实行鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。于是，我们以实行又管又帮、管和帮相结合的方针，组织了城市建设管理工作的大跃进。
    怎样贯彻又管又帮、管和帮相结合的方针呢？我们着重进行了以下三个方面的工作：
    第一、积极主动地提供设计资料，帮助建设单位加快建设速度。城市建设管理部门为了确定城市规划，搜集有城市现状、地形地质、地区资源、给水排水和公用事业情况等资料。这些资料也是建设单位进行工程设计不可缺少的根据。可是，由于我们过去搜集资料时只考虑到编制规划的需要，而没有同时考虑到设计的需要，因而资料还不够全面，不够系统，又由于资料管理人员常把向建设单位提供设计资料当成负担，我们的这些资料并没有能有效地运用来促进建设事业的发展，建设单位还需要自己动手勘测钻探，重新搜集资料。这样，既费时，又费钱。如果由城市建设管理部门根据已有的资料，再加以必要的充实，提供给建设单位，既节省时间，又节省费用。因此，我们就主动把这项工作列为城市建设管理部门的任务，向各个建设单位和设计单位提供资料。结果，收效良好，既密切了管理部门和建设单位的关系，更推动了基本建设工作的进行。例如邯郸钢铁联合厂的造厂设计，经我们主动提供资料后，他们认为可比通常建厂速度提前半年以上。今年大跃进中，其他十几个已定厂址的项目，也都是根据城市建设管理部门提供的资料进行造厂和设计的，使建厂设计的速度空前加快。同时，我们还主动提供规划管理的定额要求等规划资料，使设计单位能根据规划要求进行设计，避免了设计和规划不符而必须修改设计的返工浪费。
    第二、组织建设中的协作。基本建设中需要协作解决的问题很多，拿同城市建设管理有关的问题来看，就有土地征购，地上物拆迁赔偿、设施共用共建、土方的使用堆放、各方面管理手续的精简等等。在这方面，我们进行了一些协作组织工作，也收到很好的效果。如市服务公司建设的旅馆大楼工程，去年因拆迁二十间破房的问题得不到解决，地址变更三次，工期推迟两个多月。今年，这座大楼因地点不合适转让给别的单位，重建于火车站附近，也需要拆迁二十多间破房。这一次，经我们主动帮助组织住户拆迁，不仅进行得很顺利，而且大大减少了拆迁赔偿费。服务公司在几次选址变迁中，本来对我们有不少意见，但因为我们最后帮助他们解决了问题，也由不满转为满意。热电厂要架设八对专用通讯线，我们就组织市电话局同他们协作，在同一线路上增加八对市话线位置，既节省了投资，又避免了线路多互相干扰的情况。钢铁联合厂有大批土方需要堆置，估计要占农田一百亩，恰巧铁路工程处需用类似数量的土方，我们就组织双方协作，达成协议，各可节约投资一半，并可少占或不占农田。过去，建设单位还有一件伤脑筋的事情，就是领导多头，一项建设往往需同许多领导机关联系才能定案，延误时日。例如卫生部门要管环境卫生，公安部门要管防空距离，文化部门要管保存古迹。我们就主动联系各个单位，组织会议，用会签的办法来解决这些问题。总之，基本建设中需要各方面协作解决的问题是很多的。凡是责任不明，或者建设单位工作有困难，需要政府部门出头解决的事情，我们都主动去做。
    第三、主动上门，参加选址和规划设计工作。过去，对大的建设的选址工作，曾组织力量联合进行。但比较小的厂和民用建筑方面的选址工作，大都是由本单位自己进行，待找到合适的地点后再申请拨地。这样，地址的选择往往不符合规划的要求，形成扯皮现象。现在我们改变这种作法，主动协助选址，有的还找上门去，根据规划要求，提出地点，介绍条件，并共同到现场踏勘确定。这样，既贯彻了规划的要求，又减少了建设单位盲目找地点的时间，选定建设地点就快了。对于大的街坊的设计，也采用了这个办法。钢铁联合厂生活区的选址工作，就是建设单位和管理部门共同来做的，结果双方都很满意。对于不作设计，或使用标准图的小型建设，如果建设单位自己不会做平面布置，我们就帮助他们做，使问题能很快地得到解决。
    这三个方面的工作，都达到三个效果：加速了基本建设的进度，实现了城市规划的要求，密切了管理和建设单位的关系。因此，我们认为在城市建设管理工作中执行又管又帮，管和帮相结合的方针是必要的、正确的。它是进一步贯彻城市建设为工业生产服务的方针，克服城市建设管理上的主观主义、官僚主义，改进管理人员的工作方法和工作作风的一项重要措施。
    要执行又管又帮、管和帮相结合的方针，必须注意解决思想问题。我们在贯彻这个方针时，是曾遇到许多思想障碍的。例如，有些同志认为城市建设局是个国家机关，是个行政管理机构，实行又管又帮，管和帮相结合的方针会变更管理部门的性质。有些同志认为管理和被管理的矛盾既然是客观存在的，扯皮现象就不可避免，因而提出“不要怕扯皮，而要会扯皮”。还有些同志认为管和帮属于两个不同性质的工作范畴，无法结合，要管就不能帮，帮了就不能加强管理工作。对于这些思想障碍，不仅要用事实去批判，而且要从理论认识上加以解决。我们在讨论中引导大家认识国家机关是上层建筑，上层建筑要为经济基础服务，城市建设局当然也不例外。城市建设局管理城市的建设，是为了促进生产建设，多快好省地建设社会主义；在管理的过程中给建设单位以帮助，不但同管理的目的毫无矛盾，而且能更好地达到管理的目的。同时，我们又引导大家认识管理和被管理的矛盾，也是一种人民内部矛盾，是完全可以解决的，扯皮是应该避免，也完全可以避免的。这些思想认识问题的解决，是贯彻又管又帮、管和帮相结合，使城市建设管理工作更好地服务于工业建设的思想。
