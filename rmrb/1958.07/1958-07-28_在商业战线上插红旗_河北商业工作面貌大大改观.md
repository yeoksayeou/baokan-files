Planting Red Flags on the Commercial Front
A Greatly Improved Outlook for Commercial Work in Hebei

(Our newspaper, Baoding, 27th dispatch) The fourteen red flags that have emerged in Hebei Province's commercial sector during the Great Leap Forward have been planted all over the province. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized a large-scale inspection by ten thousand people in June, proving that these experiences have been comprehensively promoted in more than 90% of commercial units. In this way, the outlook of the province's commercial work has been fundamentally changed, becoming a new type of socialist commerce. The province has overfulfilled its plans for commodity circulation and profit delivery in the first half of the year. Compared with the same period last year, the supply of agricultural production materials has increased by 1.5 times, the purchase of agricultural and sideline products and local specialties and industrial products has increased by 1.2 times, and the profit delivery has completed more than 50% of the annual plan, exceeding the level of previous corresponding periods.

The fourteen banners of Hebei Province's commercial work are: Commercial work in Xushui County closely revolves around the central work of the Party committee and fully supports the Great Leap Forward in agriculture; Liangjiatai Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Qinglong County "explores treasures in the deep mountains" to help agricultural cooperatives develop mountain treasures; Koutou Cooperative in Xingtang County helps agricultural cooperatives develop diversified economies; Tianjin Hardware Production Materials Purchasing and Supply Station and Shijiazhuang Department Store Wholesale Station organize socialist large-scale collaboration to support the Great Leap Forward in industrial production; Tianjin Pharmaceutical Company holds regular "four-in-one" (production, supply, sales, and use) meetings to promote close integration of production and sales; Commercial departments in Pinggu County organize the masses to mine manually and refine copper with local methods; Service industries in Shijiazhuang City and Yuhua East Road Department Store in Baoding City improve their operating style and improve service quality, wholeheartedly serving customers; Zhangsanying Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Longhua County carries out "one hundred items of savings"; Wuji County Supply and Marketing Cooperative vigorously engages in waste product processing; Tangshan Prefecture reduces intermediate links, comprehensively decentralizes business, and implements direct transportation of live pigs and fresh eggs; Tangshan Department Store Wholesale Station implements "reservation, pre-allocation, transfer at the station, and integration of four personnel" to accelerate commodity circulation; Tangjiakou Warehouse in Tianjin City achieves "eight withouts" (no mold, no defective products, etc.) and "one fast" (fast commodity circulation).

After the great rectification movement and under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the staff and workers of the commercial departments in Hebei Province overcame capitalist ideology and conservative thinking, firmly established a political viewpoint, production viewpoint, and mass viewpoint, placed commercial work under the absolute leadership and supervision of the Party, resolutely listened to the Party, and made commercial work closely serve the Party's central work. At the same time, they vigorously promoted the communist spirit of mutual support and mutual promotion, and established close cooperative relations with industrial and agricultural production departments. Since the spring of this year, a situation has emerged in which the commercial sector fully supports industrial and agricultural production.

When a high tide of water conservancy construction and drought resistance movement was launched in the province's rural areas in the spring, commercial departments, on the one hand, sent tens of thousands of purchasing personnel to travel across mountains and rivers to purchase a large number of materials such as cement, steel brazers, electric motors, waterwheels, and water pumps to supply the rural areas; on the other hand, and more importantly, they organized local production and assisted agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives in running small factories that produce agricultural tools, cement, chemical fertilizers, and other products, powerfully supporting water conservancy construction and the struggle against drought and sowing. In order to assist agricultural cooperatives in solving the problem of labor shortage, commercial departments in various places vigorously carried out technical innovation movements, creating new tools that are efficient, lightweight, and labor-saving. The Cang County Commercial Bureau established a "Tool Reform Experiment Factory" and successfully trial-produced ninety-nine new tools such as horse-drawn manual rice transplanters, horse-drawn harvesters, deep plows, and wooden automatic water suction machines.

In supporting industrial production, commercial departments fully purchased all industrial and handicraft products within their business scope, helping industrial departments overcome the difficulties caused by poor sales of products and lack of funds. Starting in April, commercial departments throughout the province launched a vigorous campaign to purchase waste products, and by June, they had overfulfilled the annual waste product purchase plan. This not only provided local industries with relatively sufficient raw materials, but also increased the income of farmers throughout the province by more than 70 million yuan due to the sale of waste products.

During the rectification period, commercial departments at all levels vigorously reformed all rules and regulations that were unfavorable to production and inconvenient to the masses. Many areas implemented the "two participations and one reform" system of cadres participating in labor and staff and workers participating in management, which fully mobilized the enthusiasm of staff and workers and greatly improved work efficiency. Therefore, commercial departments throughout the province were able to draw out about 30% of their manpower to support the industrial and agricultural production front.

    在商业战线上插红旗
    河北商业工作面貌大大改观
    本报保定27日电　河北省商业部门在大跃进中出现的十四面红旗，已经插遍全省。中共河北省委在6月份组织了万人大检查，证明这些经验已在90％以上的商业单位全面推广。这样，全省商业工作的面貌就基本改观，成了新型的社会主义商业。全省上半年的商品流转与上缴利润等计划已经超额完成，和去年同期相比，供应的农业生产资料增长了一点五倍，收购的农副土特产品、工业品增长了一点二倍，上缴利润完成全年计划的50％以上，超过了历年同期的水平。
    河北省商业工作的十四面旗帜是：徐水县商业工作紧紧围绕党委中心工作，全力支持农业大跃进；青龙县亮甲台供销社“深山探宝”，帮助农业社开发山区宝藏；行唐县口头社帮助农业社发展多种经济；天津五金生产资料采购供应站和石家庄百货批发站组织社会主义大协作，支持工业生产大跃进；天津市医药公司定期举办“四合一”（产、供、销、用）会议，促进产销密切结合；平谷县商业部门组织群众用手工采矿和土法炼铜；石家庄市服务性行业和保定市裕华东路百货商店，改善经营作风，提高服务质量，全心全意为顾客服务；隆化县张三营供销社开展“百项节约”；无极县供销社大搞废品加工；唐山专区减少中间环节，把业务全面下放，生猪鲜蛋实行直线运输；唐山百货批发站实行“预定、预拨、就站中转、四员合一”，加速商品流转；天津市唐家口仓库实现“八无”（无霉变、无残品等）“一快”（商品流转快）。
    经过伟大的整风运动，并在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，河北省商业部门的职工克服了资本主义思想和保守思想，牢固地确立了政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，把商业工作放在党的绝对领导和监督之下，坚决听党的话，使商业工作紧紧地为党的中心工作服务，同时大力发扬互相支援互相促进的共产主义协作精神，同工农业生产部门建立了密切的协作关系。从今年春季起，就出现了一个商业部门全力支持工农业生产的局面。
    当春季全省农村掀起水利建设高潮和抗旱运动的时候，商业部门一方面派出上万个采购人员，跋山涉水，在全国各地采购了大批水泥、钢钎、电动机和水车、水泵等器材供应农村；另一方面，更主要的是组织当地生产，协助农业社和手工业社兴办生产农具、水泥、化肥等产品的小型工厂，有力地支援了水利建设和抗旱播种斗争。为了协助农业社解决劳动力缺乏的问题，各地商业部门大搞技术革新运动，创造效率高又轻便省力的新工具。沧县商业局建立“工具改革试验厂”，试制成功马拉手摇插秧机、马拉收割机、深耕犁、木制自动吸水机等九十九种新工具。
    在支援工业生产方面，商业部门对经营范围以内的工业、手工业产品全部包销下来，帮助工业部门克服了因产品不好销售而造成资金缺乏的困难。4月份起，全省商业部门掀起了一个大力收购废品的运动，到6月份就超额完成了全年废品收购计划，不仅使地方工业有了较充足的原料，还使全省农民因出售废品增加了七千多万元的收入。
    各级商业部门在整风期间大力改革了一切不利于生产、不便利群众的规章制度，很多地区实行了干部参加劳动、职工参加管理的“两参一改”的制度，使职工的积极性充分发挥，工作效率大大提高。因此全省商业部门能够抽出30％左右的人力支援工农业生产战线。
