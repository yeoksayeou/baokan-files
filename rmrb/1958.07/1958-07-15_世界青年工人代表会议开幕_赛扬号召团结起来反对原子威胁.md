Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 14th: The first World Youth Workers' Conference, convened by the World Federation of Trade Unions, opened here today. Representatives of young workers from the Soviet Union, China, and more than fifty other countries from around the world are participating in the conference. Many trade union organizations that are not affiliated with the WFTU have also sent representatives to the conference.

The agenda of the conference is: (1) The economic and social demands of young workers; (2) The struggle for peace; (3) Organizational issues.

Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, delivered the opening speech. He said that we are now facing two paths: to unite in order to avoid the atomic threat, or to allow the imperialists to launch a third world war.

Saillant criticized the notion that trade union organizations with different organizational systems, different political and religious beliefs, and belonging to different races cannot cooperate with the World Federation of Trade Unions. He reiterated that there is absolutely no discrimination within the WFTU.

France's Sardou made a report on the first item on the agenda. He pointed out that as a result of the economic crisis in capitalist countries, the number of unemployed people is increasing, which particularly affects young workers because they lack qualifications and experience. The working people of colonial and underdeveloped countries, especially young workers, are combining the anti-colonialist struggle with a powerful movement for industrialization and agricultural reform.

In his report, Sardou demanded that young workers be given the right to education and vocational training. He pointed out that under the capitalist system, the working and living conditions of young workers are deteriorating, while under the socialist system, the working and living conditions of young workers have improved greatly.

Sardou's report also called for improving young workers' health protection and safety conditions. He emphasized that young male and female workers have the right to equal pay for equal work with adults. He also condemned the appalling exploitation of young people and children in capitalist countries. Sardou finally called on all young people to take concerted action to continuously defend and expand the rights of young workers.

The conference then discussed the report.

    世界青年工人代表会议开幕
    赛扬号召团结起来反对原子威胁
    新华社布拉格14日电　由世界工会联合会决定召开的第一次世界青年工人代表会议今天在这里开幕。参加会议的有苏联、中国和来自世界各地的五十多个国家的青年工人代表。许多不属于世界工联的工会组织也派遣代表出席了会议。
    会议的议程是：（一）青年工人的经济和社会要求；（二）争取和平的斗争；（三）组织问题。
    世界工联总书记赛扬致开幕词。他说，现在我们面临着两条道路，那就是团结起来以便避免原子威胁，或者是让帝国主义分子发动第三次世界大战。
    赛扬指责那种认为有着不同的组织系统、不同的政治和宗教信仰以及属于不同的种族的工会组织不可能同世界工联进行合作的说法。他重申，在世界工联内部根本不存在任何歧视。
    法国的萨耳杜契在会上就第一项议程作了报告。他指出，资本主义国家由于经济危机的结果，失业人数越来越多，这尤其影响到了青年工人，因为他们缺乏资历和条件。殖民地和不发达的国家的劳动人民，特别是青年工人正在结合反殖民主义斗争进行着争取工业化和农业改革的强大运动。
    萨耳杜契在报告中要求给青年工人以受教育和业务训练的权利。他指出在资本主义制度下，青年工人的工作和生活条件日趋恶化，而在社会主义制度下青年工人的工作和生活条件则是有了很大改善。
    萨耳杜契在报告中还要求改善青年工人的健康保护和生命安全条件。他强调，男女青年工人有权利同成年人同工同酬。他还谴责在资本主义国家内对青年和儿童的惊人的剥削。萨耳杜契最后要求所有青年人采取一致行动不断进行保卫和扩大青年工人的权利的斗争。
    会议接着讨论了这个报告。
