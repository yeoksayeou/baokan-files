Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 10th: The Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party solemnly opened at 9:00 AM (Central European Time) today in Berlin's famous Seelenbinder Hall.

	Thirty-six enormous red flags were erected at the entrance to the venue, and the heroic slogan of the congress, "Advance in the Struggle to Safeguard Peace and the Victory of Socialism!" was hung at the front of the hall.

	Two thousand two hundred and sixty delegates, delegations from forty-six fraternal parties, and two thousand guests attended the opening ceremony.

	At 9:00 AM sharp, Ulbricht and Grotewohl, supporting the ailing Wilhelm Pieck, walked onto the stage with members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party. The entire hall rose to its feet, erupting in prolonged, enthusiastic cheers and applause.

	The opening ceremony was presided over by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party. After formally announcing the opening of the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party, Ulbricht first extended a warm welcome to the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Khrushchev, the delegation of the Communist Party of China headed by Dong Biwu, and the delegations of the other forty-four fraternal parties. He then, on behalf of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, thanked all the workers, farmers, engineers, and cultural workers of the German Democratic Republic for the brilliant achievements they had made in socialist construction and production, especially the tremendous leaps in industry, agriculture, and culture brought about by the socialist production competition launched in recent months in preparation for the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party. Ulbricht pointed out that the active participation of the broad masses of the people in the preparations for the congress reflected the changes in the German Democratic Republic, particularly the changes that had taken place in the new situation over the past year. He also pointed out that the National Front of Democratic Germany had also put forward many important suggestions to the German Socialist Unity Party.

	At Ulbricht's proposal, the entire hall stood in silent tribute to outstanding representatives of the international workers' movement, such as Zapotocky and Cachin, who had passed away since the Third Party Conference of the German Socialist Unity Party in 1956. After Ulbricht delivered his opening speech, all the delegates unanimously elected the presidium of the congress and unanimously adopted the proposal to invite the delegations of the fraternal parties attending the congress to take seats on the presidium.

	Subsequently, the elected presidium and delegations of the fraternal parties walked onto the stage amidst prolonged and enthusiastic applause. When the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Khrushchev and the delegation of the Communist Party of China headed by Dong Biwu shook hands tightly with Pieck, Ulbricht, and Grotewohl, the enthusiastic atmosphere in the hall reached its peak.

	All the delegates then unanimously elected the secretariat, credentials committee, drafting committee, proposals committee, and election committee of the congress, and subsequently unanimously approved the rules of procedure and agenda of the congress.

	The main agenda of the congress is:

	Composition of the congress institutions.

	Report on "Struggling to Safeguard Peace and the Victory of Socialism" (Reporter: Ulbricht).

	Report of the Central Auditing Committee.

	Discussion on the Central Committee's written report and Ulbricht's oral report.

	Reports from the various committees of the congress.

	Election of central organs.

	After the adoption of the congress agenda, Ulbricht asked the delegates and guests to understand that Comrade Wilhelm Pieck could not fully participate in the meeting due to health reasons, at which point Ulbricht shouted "Long live the working President of the German Democratic Republic, our Comrade Pieck!" All the participants also rose and shouted: Long live! The hall once again resounded with prolonged applause. The eighty-two-year-old Comrade Pieck waved frequently to all the delegates and guests in the thunderous applause before leaving the hall.

	Subsequently, Grotewohl, who was presiding over the first meeting, invited Ulbricht to deliver the report on "Struggling to Safeguard Peace and the Victory of Socialism."

    在为保障和平和社会主义胜利的斗争中前进！
    德国统一社会党代表大会开幕
    四十六个兄弟党代表团应邀参加大会
    新华社柏林10日电　德国统一社会党第五次代表大会今天上午九时（中欧时间）在柏林著名的塞棱宾德体育馆隆重开幕。
    在会场大门口树立着三十六面巨幅的红旗，大厅正面悬挂着充满英雄气概的大会口号：“在为保障和平和社会主义胜利的斗争中前进！”
    参加大会开幕式的有二千二百六十位代表和四十六个兄弟党的代表团及来宾二千人。
    九点正，乌布利希和格罗提渥搀扶着正在病中的威廉·皮克同统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员们走上主席台，这时全场起立，长时间地热烈欢呼和鼓掌。
    开幕式是由德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记瓦尔特·乌布利希主持的。乌布利希在正式宣布德国统一社会党第五次代表大会开幕后，首先对以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联共产党代表团、以董必武为首的中国共产党代表团和其他四十四个兄弟党代表团表示热烈的欢迎。接着，他代表德国统一社会党中央委员会感谢德意志民主共和国的全体工人、农民、工程师和文化工作者在社会主义建设和生产中所取得的辉煌成就，特别是在最近几个月中为迎接德国统一社会党第五次代表大会而展开的社会主义生产竞赛运动中为工农业和文化部门带来的巨大跃进。乌布利希指出，全国广大劳动人民积极参加大会的筹备工作，反映了德意志民主共和国的变化，特别是在最近一年内的新形势下所发生的变化。他并且指出，民主德国全国阵线也对德国统一社会党提出了许多重要的建议。
    在乌布利希的提议下，全场起立为在1956年德国统一社会党第三次代表会议以后逝世的国际工人运动的卓越代表加香和萨波托斯基等默哀。在乌布利希致开幕词以后，全体代表一致选出了大会的主席团，并且一致通过了请前来参加代表大会的各兄弟党代表团在主席台上就座的建议。
    随后，当选的主席团和兄弟党代表团在经久不息的热烈掌声中走上了主席台。当以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联共产党代表团和以董必武为首的中国共产党代表团同皮克、乌布利希和格罗提渥紧紧地握手时，会场的热烈气氛达到了顶点。
    全体代表接着一致选出了大会的秘书处、资格审查委员会、编纂委员会、提案委员会和选举委员会，随后还一致通过了大会的议事规则和议程。
    大会的主要议程是：
    代表大会机构的组成。
    关于“为保障和平和社会主义的胜利而斗争”的报告（报告人：乌布利希）。
    中央检查委员会的报告。
    就中央委员会的书面报告和乌布利希的口头报告进行讨论。
    代表大会的各委员会的报告。
    选举中央机构。
    在通过大会议程以后，乌布利希要求代表们和来宾们谅解威廉·皮克同志由于健康原因不能全部参加会议，这时乌布利希高呼“德意志民主共和国的工人总统，我们的皮克同志万岁！”全体与会者也起立高呼：万岁！会场里又一次响起了长时间的掌声。八十二岁的皮克同志在雷动的掌声中频频地向全体代表和来宾招手后离开了会场。
    接着主持第一次会议的格罗提渥请乌布利希作关于“为保障和平和社会主义的胜利而斗争”的报告。
