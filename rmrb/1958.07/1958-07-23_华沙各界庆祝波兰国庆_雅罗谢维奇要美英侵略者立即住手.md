Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 22nd. People from all walks of life in Warsaw held a celebration meeting at the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw at 6 p.m. on the 21st to celebrate the 14th anniversary of the founding of Poland. About 4,000 people attended the celebration meeting, including representatives of the working people, famous social activists, and envoys from various countries.

Polish party and government leaders Gomulka, Cyrankiewicz, Loga-Sowinski, Rapacki, Samborski and others also attended the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Vicek, Speaker of the Polish Parliament.

Polish Deputy Prime Minister Jaroszewicz delivered a report on the 14th anniversary of the founding of Poland at the meeting. He first expressed his gratitude to the Soviet people. He said that fourteen years ago, our Soviet friends brought us not only freedom but also sincerity and friendship. They helped us restore and build our country. The blood of Soviet soldiers and our people did not shed in vain, and the programmatic July Manifesto of 1944 is being successfully realized. Then Jaroszewicz cited examples in detail to describe the great achievements of Poland's industry, agriculture, culture, and education in the past fourteen years. He emphasized that these achievements need to be evaluated fairly.

When talking about the international situation, Jaroszewicz said that the unity of the socialist camp is the guarantee of Poland's independence and world peace, especially now that the imperialist ruling groups are pursuing a policy of strength and a policy of aggression. The United States and Britain's blatant armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan is a concrete manifestation of this policy. They want to support anti-people regimes with bayonets. We sympathize with the struggle of the Arab people for freedom. The voice of our people's protest has converged with the voices of people all over the world against the U.S. and British aggression in the Middle East. On behalf of the Polish people, he demanded that the U.S. and British aggressor troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, and announced that the entire Polish people support the Polish government's statement and support the Soviet Premier Khrushchev's proposal to convene a summit conference of major powers.

    华沙各界庆祝波兰国庆
    雅罗谢维奇要美英侵略者立即住手
    据新华社华沙22日电  华沙各界人民21日晚六时在华沙文化科学宫会议大厅举行庆祝大会，庆祝波兰建国十四周年。出席庆祝大会的有劳动人民的代表，著名的社会活动家，各国使节等约四千人。
    波兰党和政府领导人哥穆尔卡、西伦凯维兹、洛加—索文斯基、腊帕茨基、萨姆布罗夫斯基等也参加了大会。
    大会由波兰议会议长维策赫主持。
    波兰部长会议副主席雅罗谢维奇在会上作了关于波兰建国十四周年的报告。他首先向苏联人民表示感谢。他说，十四年前苏联朋友带给我们的不仅是自由而且是真心和友谊。他们帮助我们恢复和建设我们的国家。苏联战士和我国人民的血没有白流，1944年纲领性的七月宣言，正在成功地实现。接着雅罗谢维奇举例详尽地叙述了波兰工农业和文化教育方面十四年来的伟大成就。他强调说，需要公正地评价这些成就。
    雅罗谢维奇在谈到国际情势时说，社会主义阵营的团结是波兰独立和世界和平的保证。特别在现在，帝国主义统治集团奉行实力政策、侵略政策。美国和英国粗暴地武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦就是这一政策的具体表现。它们是想用刺刀支持反人民的政权。我们同情争取自由的阿拉伯人民的斗争。我国人民抗议的声音已经同全世界人民反对美英在中近东进行侵略的呼声汇合在一起。他代表波兰人民要求美英侵略军立刻撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，宣布波兰全体人民支持波兰政府的声明，支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫关于召开大国首脑会议的建议。
