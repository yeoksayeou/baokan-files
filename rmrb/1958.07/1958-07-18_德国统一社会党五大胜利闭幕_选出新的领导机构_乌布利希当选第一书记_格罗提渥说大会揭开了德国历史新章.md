Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 16th: The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which opened on the 10th, victoriously concluded today after holding seven days of meetings, passing resolutions, and electing a new Central Committee.

    In a closed meeting held this morning, the Congress elected the Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission of the current Congress by secret ballot.

    At the subsequent open meeting, the chairman of the election committee, Max Opitz, announced the election results of the new Central Committee. The entire audience congratulated Pieck, Ulbricht, and Grotewohl on their re-election with prolonged and enthusiastic applause.

    Opitz reported to the Congress that almost 100 percent of the candidates were elected with full votes (1,648 votes). Opitz pointed out that this showed the unity and solidarity of the Party. He also announced the list of the new Central Auditing Commission.

    At today's Congress, Enrique Lister, member of the Political Bureau of the Spanish Communist Party, Yrjö Räntilä, member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party, Apostolos Grozos, Chairman of the Greek Communist Party, Haken, member of the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party (representing the delegation of fraternal parties from the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland), a representative of the Central Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party, Bourguia, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Moroccan Communist Party, and Hamel, Secretary of the Tunisian Communist Party, delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting.

    The executive chairman of the Congress also read out congratulatory telegrams sent by the Communist Parties of Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Ceylon, Uruguay, and San Marino.

    After Grotewohl delivered the closing speech, the Congress victoriously concluded amidst the solemn singing of The Internationale.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 16th: At the final meeting of the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany this afternoon, Grotewohl delivered the closing speech. On behalf of the Congress, he expressed his sincerest gratitude to the delegations of fraternal parties from various countries, saying, "Your participation has made our Congress an unforgettable demonstration of proletarian internationalism. This spirit of proletarian internationalism fills us with confidence that socialism will be victorious throughout the world." Grotewohl asked the delegations of fraternal parties to take the following message back to their countries: "Your people can rely on the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the first German state of workers and peasants at any time."

    Grotewohl then emphasized that the Party's Fifth Congress had opened a new chapter in German history. He said that the best way to consolidate peace is "to achieve it through our leap towards socialism. Because only socialism can guarantee peace." He also said that the Party Congress proved that the reunification of Germany, under the current conditions, can only be achieved through the establishment of a confederation of two German states.

    Grotewohl said, "We can immediately state the preconditions we demand for reunification, namely: the elimination of militarism and fascists in West Germany and the immediate cessation of Bonn's adventurous war policy." He said, "We will continue to make this demand to the Federal Government until this demand is realized through the efforts of the people."

    Grotewohl emphasized that this Party Congress once again confirmed the historical importance of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. All revisionists and opportunists who try to hinder our progress have been clearly defeated. He said, "There is no place for them here." However, he pointed out that the ideological education work carried out by the Party to enhance the socialist consciousness of the working people is far from over and must be strengthened in accordance with the basic principles determined by the Party Congress.

    Grotewohl finally asked the representatives to "spread the optimism, enthusiasm, and revolutionary drive that fills our hearts to the working people"; after returning to their posts, they should maintain closer ties with all the people and bravely complete the Party's tasks. He said with confidence: "As long as we further strengthen the Socialist Unity Party of Germany as a fighting Marxist-Leninist party, as long as we stand firmly and loyally on the side of the Soviet Union and all Communist and Workers' Parties, we will certainly be able to accomplish our historical mission."

    After Grotewohl delivered the closing speech, the entire audience stood up and burst into prolonged cheers and applause. The Congress victoriously concluded amidst the solemn singing of The Internationale.

    新华社柏林16日电　10日开幕的德国统一社会党第五次代表大会在举行了七天会议、通过了决议和选出新的中央委员会以后，在今天胜利闭幕。
    在今天早晨举行的秘密会议上，大会以秘密投票方式选出了本届大会的中央委员会和中央检查委员会。
    在随后举行的公开会议上，选举委员会主席马克斯·奥皮茨宣布了新的中央委员会选举结果。全场以长时间的热烈鼓掌祝贺皮克、乌布利希、格罗提渥重新当选。
    奥皮茨向大会报告说，投票结果，几乎百分之百的候选人是以全票（一千六百四十八票）当选的。奥皮茨指出，这显示了党的统一和团结。他还宣布了新的中央检查委员会的名单。
    在今天的大会上，西班牙共产党政治局委员恩里克·利斯特、芬兰共产党中央书记处委员荣蒂拉、希腊共产党主席阿波斯托洛斯·格罗佐斯、荷兰共产党中央委员哈肯（代表荷、比、卢、瑞士四国兄弟党代表团）、巴西共产党中央委员会的一位代表、摩洛哥共产党政治局委员兼中央书记布尔吉亚、突尼斯共产党书记哈梅尔先后在会上致了祝词。
    大会执行主席还在会上宣读了日本、新西兰、澳大利亚、锡兰、乌拉圭和圣马力诺等国共产党拍来的贺电。

    新华社柏林16日电　今天下午在德国统一社会党第五次代表大会的末次会议上，格罗提渥致闭幕词。他以代表大会的名义向各国兄弟党代表团表示最诚挚的感谢说，“由于你们的参加，使我们的大会成了无产阶级国际主义的一次令人难忘的示威。这种无产阶级国际主义精神使我们充满了社会主义将在全世界获得胜利的信心。”格罗提渥请各兄弟党代表团把下面的话带回国去：“你们的人民在任何时候都可以信赖德国统一社会党和第一个德意志工农国家。”
    格罗提渥接着强调指出，党的第五次代表大会揭开了德国历史的新的一章。他说，巩固和平的最好途径是“通过我们向社会主义的跃进来实现。因为只有社会主义才能保障和平。”他又说，党代表大会证明，德国的重新统一在目前的条件下，只能通过建立两个德国的邦联来实现。
    格罗提渥说，“我们可以马上说出我们要求作为重新统一的前提条件，这就是：肃清西德的军国主义和法西斯分子以及立即停止波恩的冒险的战争政策。”他说，“我们将向联邦政府不断提出这个要求，直到这个要求通过人民的努力获得实现为止。”
    格罗提渥强调指出，这次党代表大会再一次证实了德国统一社会党的历史重要性。所有力图阻挠我们前进的修正主义分子和机会主义分子都遭到了明显的挫败。他说，“在我们这里没有他们的位置。”但是他指出，党为提高劳动人民的社会主义觉悟而展开的思想教育工作还远没有结束，必须遵照党代表大会所确定的基本方针继续予以加强。
    格罗提渥最后要求代表们“把充满我们心中的乐观主义、热情和革命干劲传播到劳动人民心里去”；在回到自己的工作岗位上以后，要更紧密地联系全体人民，勇敢地完成党的任务。他满怀信心地说：“只要我们进一步加强作为一个战斗的马克思列宁主义政党的德国统一社会党，只要我们坚定而忠诚地站在苏联以及一切共产党和工人党这一边，我们就一定能够完成我们的历史任务。
