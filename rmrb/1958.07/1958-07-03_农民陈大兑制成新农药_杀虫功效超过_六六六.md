    Farmer Chen Dadui Develops New Pesticide
    Insecticidal Effect Surpasses "666"
    Chen Dadui, deputy director of the Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative in Shangyuan Township, Nankang County, Jiangxi Province, recently used tobacco stalks and prickly ash leaves to make a pesticide that is more effective than "223" emulsion and "666" pesticide powder. It can kill more than ten kinds of rice pests such as rice planthoppers, rice stem borers, grasshoppers, and rice locusts all at once.

    Chen Dadui is 41 years old, a Communist Party member, and did not graduate from elementary school. Based on his experience of using tobacco stalks to prevent insect pests in glutinous rice fields and using prickly ash leaves water to wipe the bodies of cattle to drive away mosquitoes and flies, he decided to put these two raw materials together for testing. In early May, he put 126.3 jin of tobacco stalks and 483.8 jin of prickly ash leaves in a clean manure cellar and poured 40 loads of clean water to soak them. He turned it over once every afternoon. After ten days, the water gave off a strong stench. After a few more days, white foam appeared on the top, and the water turned into a thick yellow like tung oil.

    On May 14, the Nankang County People's Committee sent technician Li Chenglin to the Xingguang Cooperative to select a 1.6-mu field with various insects for testing. At 6:30 p.m. that day, Chen Dadui and Li Chenglin mixed 100 jin of tobacco and prickly ash liquid with 30 jin of clean water and 3 liang of "666" powder, drained the water from the rice field to the "soil surface water" level, and sprinkled the medicine into the field with a manure spoon. Although there was a heavy rain that night at 1 a.m., when they checked the next morning, except for a few planthoppers that had not been completely killed, rice planthoppers, rice stem borers, grasshoppers, and rice locusts were all killed. Because the medicinal properties were too strong, the loaches, frogs, and mosquitoes in the field were also poisoned to death. At the same time, because the tobacco and prickly ash pesticide is synthesized from the juice of two plants with extremely high fertilizer content, it not only has a unique insecticidal effect, but also has great benefits for the growth of rice seedlings. It is estimated that every 100 jin of tobacco and prickly ash medicine is equivalent to 100 jin of small fertilizer.

    Many agricultural cooperatives in Nankang County are imitating the production according to Chen Dadui's experiments. Relevant departments are further studying the effect of tobacco and prickly ash liquid on preventing rice blast and eliminating heartworms.

### 农民陈大兑制成新农药  杀虫功效超过“六六六”

    农民陈大兑制成新农药
    杀虫功效超过“六六六”
    江西南康县上芫乡星光农业社副社长陈大兑最近用烟茎、山椒树叶制成了一种功效赛过“二二三”乳剂及“六六六”药粉的杀虫农药，一次可使稻飞虱、螟蛾、桀叶虫、稻蝗等十多种水稻害虫全部丧生。
    陈大兑今年四十一岁，共产党员，小学未毕业。他根据用烟茎防止糯子田发生虫害和用山椒子树叶水擦牛身驱逐蚊子苍蝇的经验，决定将这两种原料放在一起，进行试验。5月初，他将一百二十六斤三两烟茎、四百八十三斤八两山椒树叶，放在洁净的粪窖里，倒了四十担清水沤上。每天下午翻一次，到十天后，水就发出了浓臭味。又过几天，顶上冒出白沫，水就变成了桐油一样浓黄。
    5月14日，南康县人民委员会派技术员李成林到星光社，选了一丘一分六厘各种虫子都有的田，进行了试验。当日晚上六时三十分，陈大兑和李成林将一百斤烟椒药水掺入三十斤清水和三两“六六六”粉，把稻田水放到“地皮水”后，把药用粪勺子扬到田里。当夜一时，虽落了一场大暴雨，但到第二天早晨检查时，除少数浮尘子还未全杀死外，稻飞虱、螟蛾、桀叶虫、稻蝗等都被杀死了。由于药性过烈，田里的泥鳅、青蛙、蚊子也都被毒死了。同时，由于烟椒农药是由两种含肥极高的植物汁合成，所以它不仅有奇特的杀虫效果，而且对于禾苗生长有极大好处。估计每百斤烟椒药可抵一百斤小肥。
    南康县不少农业社正按照陈大兑的试验进行仿制。有关部门正在进一步研究烟椒药水对防止稻热病和消灭钻心虫的效果。
