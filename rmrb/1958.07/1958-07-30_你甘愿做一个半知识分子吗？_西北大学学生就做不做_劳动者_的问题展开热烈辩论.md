Are You Willing to Be a Semi-Intellectual?
Northwest University Students Engage in Heated Debate on Whether to Be "Laborers"

(Our dispatch) This newspaper reporters Qi Yuanzhen and Sun Chuanhao reported: Two thousand six hundred students at Northwest University are currently engaged in a heated debate on the educational policy proposed by Chairman Mao of cultivating "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." The majority of students felt excited and proud that they could become laborers after graduation. However, a small number of people still have incorrect views about "laborers." Some believe that training college students to be laborers is a waste of talent, because physical labor that creates material wealth is "simple labor," while the spiritual wealth created by intellectuals is "complex labor," a "waste of talent". Some in the Biology Department suggested that local experts like termite expert Li Shimei should not be professors or researchers because the knowledge he possesses is partial and unsystematic; it is only perceptual knowledge, without theoretical knowledge. They claimed that college students could learn these technical skills in three months, while Li Shimei could not learn the theoretical knowledge in three years. Many students introduced Li Shimei's systematic knowledge of the life history, distribution, and harmfulness of termites, as well as the significant impact of his successful research, effectively refuting the fallacy that local experts only possess fragmented knowledge. Some students asked: What constitutes "great talent"? They cited some professors in the department who were considered "great talents" but could not even control pests on fruit trees. Some professors had also studied methods of termite control but never succeeded. During this period, students visited the nearby Shafutuo Agricultural Cooperative. They were deeply impressed by the wisdom of the farmers who grafted cotton onto ailanthus trees, which not only transformed herbaceous plants into woody plants but also increased yields. Inspired by the farmers, they are now experimenting with grafting cotton onto rose bushes, hoping to produce colored and fragrant cotton. Students went to the agricultural cooperative and saw that the rabbits raised by the farmers were fat and strong, and a few rabbits with coccidiosis were cured by the farmers using local methods like feeding them onions and giving them enemas. However, eighty rabbits raised in the school's biology garden all contracted coccidiosis, and the teachers and students could not find a cure even after consulting many documents. The teachers fed them some "foreign medicine," but it didn't work, and seventy-nine rabbits died. Comparing these facts, the students said: "We can get a score of five for textbook knowledge, but if we are tested on the real ability to solve practical problems, we can only get a score of two." "The knowledge of local experts is not something we can learn in three months, but something we can't finish learning in three years." Jiang Bingzheng, a student in the Law Department, said that history proves that not only is material wealth created by the working people, but spiritual wealth is also created by the working people. Without class struggle and the struggle for production, writers and poets cannot create works. Knowledge gained from books is only half-knowledge, it is walking on one leg, and this is the biggest waste.

Zhou Junqian, a third-year student in the History Department, raised the "theory of social division of labor," which sparked widespread debate. Zhou Junqian said, "According to the social division of labor, intellectuals should mainly engage in mental labor" and "even private agricultural middle schools should train indoor workers." In recent days, the Northwest University's school newspaper has published dozens of articles criticizing this erroneous viewpoint. They believe that Zhou Junqian's "theory of social division of labor" is peddling bourgeois goods, wanting to take the old road of bourgeois intellectuals who "do not use their four limbs and cannot distinguish the five grains," opposing intellectuals' participation in physical labor. He wants intellectuals to only sit indoors, make plans, design, and point fingers. He also portrays the relationship between intellectuals and the working people as a naked commodity exchange relationship. Intellectuals can use knowledge as a commodity to exchange for clothes and food from workers and peasants. Some intellectuals in the past were aloof, only studying books and not integrating with labor, accomplishing nothing. Integrating with labor has achieved great success. Peng Shijiang, a technician in the inspection department of the Xi'an Machine Manufacturing Plant, successfully tested and produced electronic cutting machine blanking in combination with old workers, which increased efficiency by four times and saved a lot of steel. After the cadres and engineering technicians of this factory participated in labor and jointly studied with the workers, they abolished more than 100 unreasonable rules and regulations and revised 75, accounting for 76% of all rules and regulations. Nearly 300 forms were abolished and revised.

Some students in the Geology Department believe that the goal of cultivating "laborers" today is because the previous goal of cultivating "scholars" and "experts" was too high, and most people could not reach it. This argument has been opposed by many people. They said that the past educational policy and the educational policy proposed today are essentially the same, both being the policy of both morality and talent, being both red and expert. The idea that the goal of cultivating "scholars" and "experts" was too high, so the policy of cultivating "laborers" was proposed, actually means that cultivating "laborers" is lowering the standard and is a reflection of the thought of underestimating the working people.

Currently, this meaningful debate is proceeding step by step in depth. In the process of discussion, more and more students are supporting and agreeing with this educational policy. The small number of students who originally adhered to the wrong viewpoints have begun to admit that their original views were wrong in the face of a large number of facts and are determined to transform themselves in labor.

    你甘愿做一个半知识分子吗？
    西北大学学生就做不做“劳动者”的问题展开热烈辩论
    本报讯　记者戚元珍、孙传镐报道：西北大学二千六百名学生正在对毛主席提出的培养“有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者”的教育方针，展开了热烈的辩论。大多数学生看到这个方针以后，感到自己毕业后能够成为一个劳动者感到兴奋和骄傲。但是，有少数人对“劳动者”还存在着错误看法。有的认为把大学生培养成劳动者是大材小用，是浪费，原因是创造物质财富的体力劳动是“简单劳动”，而知识分子创造的精神财富是“复杂劳动”，是“大材”。生物系有的人提出白蚁专家李始美等土专家不能当教授和研究员，因为他掌握的知识是局部的，不是系统的，只有感性知识，没有理论知识。这些技术知识，大学生三个月就能学会，理论知识，李始美三年也学不会。很多学生把李始美对白蚁的生活史、分布情况、危害性的系统情况以及研究成功后的重大意义等作了介绍，有力地批驳了土专家掌握的知识是片断的谬论。有些学生提出：什么是“大材”呢？他们举出系里一些被认为是“大材”的教授们，连果树的虫害也防治不了。有的教授也曾经研究过防治白蚁的方法，始终也没有成功。在这个期间，学生们到附近沙泘沱农业社访问，学生看到农民们把棉花嫁接到椿树上，非常钦佩农民的智慧，这样嫁接后不仅把草本植物变成木本植物，而且产量高。在农民的启发下，他们正在作棉花嫁接在玫瑰花上的试验，希望能够结出有色有香的棉花。学生们到农业社去看农民饲养的兔子又肥又壮，少数得了球虫病的兔子，农民用土方法给喂些洋葱、灌灌肠就好了；而学校生物园中养的八十只兔子，都得了球虫病，师生们翻了很多文献也找不出治疗的方法，教师给喂了些“洋药”也没治好，结果死了七十九只。这许多事实一对比，学生们说：“考书本上的知识咱能得五分，要考真正能够解决实际问题的本领，咱只能得二分。”“土专家的知识我们不是三个月就能学会，而是三年也学不完。”法律系学生姜秉正说，历史证明，不仅物质财富是劳动人民创造的，精神财富也是劳动人民创造的。没有阶级斗争和生产斗争，作家诗人就写不出作品来。从书本上得到的知识只是半知识分子，是一条腿走路，这是最大的浪费。
    历史系三年级学生周钧钱提出的“社会分工论”引起了广泛的争论。周钧钱说，“按照社会分工，知识分子应该主要搞脑力劳动”、“连民办农业中学也应培养室内工作者”。连日来，西北大学的校刊发表了数十篇文章批驳这个错误论点，他们认为周钧钱提出的“社会分工论”是贩卖资产阶级货色，是想走“四体不勤，五谷不分”的资产阶级知识分子的老路，把知识分子与劳动人民对立起来，反对知识分子参加体力劳动。他要知识分子只坐在室内，订计划，搞设计，指手划脚。他把知识分子与劳动人民的关系，也描绘成赤裸裸的商品交换关系。知识分子可以把知识当作商品向工人农民交换衣服、粮食。有些知识分子过去高高在上，只啃书本，不和劳动相结合，一事无成。和劳动相结合，就取得了很大成绩。西安机器制造厂检验科技术员彭世江参加劳动后与老工人结合试验成功电子切割机下料，效率提高了四倍，节省了很多钢材。这个厂的干部和工程技术人员参加劳动后，和工人共同研究，废除了不合理的规章制度一百多种，修改了七十五种，占全部规章制度76％。废除和修改的表格近三百种。
    地质系有的学生认为，今天提出培养“劳动者”是因为过去提的培养“学者”“专家”的目标太高了，一般人达不到。这个论点受到了很多人的反对。他们说，过去的教育方针和今天提出的教育方针本质上是一致的，都是德才兼备、又红又专的方针。认为培养“学者”
  “专家”的目标太高，才提出培养“劳动者”的方针的说法，实际上就是说培养“劳动者”是降低了标准，是轻视劳动人民的思想反映。
    目前，这场有意义的争论正在步步深入地进行着。在讨论过程中，拥护和同意这种教育方针的学生越来越多了，原来坚持错误论点的少数学生在大量事实面前，开始承认原来看法是错误的。决心在劳动中改造自己。（附图片）
