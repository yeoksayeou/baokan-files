    The First Pair of New Shafts at Jiaozuo Coal Mine
    The first and largest pair of shafts built after liberation in China's famous Jiaozuo Coal Mine—the Zhucun shafts—were put into production two months ahead of schedule on "July 1st." The large Zhucun mine shafts currently have an annual output of 600,000 tons, and by 1960, the output will increase to 900,000 tons. This pair of shafts is one of the more mechanized in the current Jiaozuo mining area. Except for the main and auxiliary shaft hoists, all equipment is manufactured in China. This is a corner of the Zhucun shafts.

    焦作煤矿第一对新竖井
    我国著名的焦作煤矿解放后第一对最大的矿井——朱村竖井提前两个月于“七一”投入生产。朱村矿大型竖井目前年产六十万吨，到1960年产量即提高到九十万吨。这对竖井是当前焦作矿区机械化程度较高的一对，除主、副井绞车外，全部设备都是我国自己制造的。这是朱村竖井的一角。
