Xinhua News Agency, July 1st. Various branches of the People's Liberation Army have held dedication and victory celebration conferences to commemorate "July 1st" (the anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party).

    At the dedication conference held by the Beijing Military Region's leading organs tonight, various units presented their leap forward achievements in military training, cultural learning, inventions, and other fields to the Party. A certain communications regiment presented more than 260 inventions and over 600 leap forward proposals. At the General Logistics Department's "Treasure Presentation" conference, eleven units dedicated 32 inventions to the Party. Communist Party member Second Lieutenant Zeng Jigan, after creating a "vegetable cutting machine," also created seven valuable new products such as "solid alcohol," and was commended by the Party committee. This morning, three units, including the Naval Engineering Department, paraded with drums and gongs, carrying the recently created "concrete oil pipe," which exceeds international advanced standards, to report the good news to the naval leaders.

    Under the slogan "Welcome 'July 1st,' Dedicate to the Party," many moving stories of leaps forward have emerged in various units in recent days. A certain unit guarding an island, despite its heavy defense tasks, overfulfilled its training tasks for the first half of the year. A certain regiment of the Zhejiang Military Region basically eliminated illiteracy after three months of cultural learning. On June 26th, the affiliated hospital of a certain military medical university successfully performed open-heart surgery using an artificial heart.

    Many military organs and units today launched commemorative activities focusing on studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong.
