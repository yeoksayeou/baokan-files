Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st: The ten major coarse grain producing provinces and regions in northern China recently held an on-site promotion conference in Gaoping County, Shanxi, on increasing the production of millet, sorghum, and corn. The conference decided to make every effort to strengthen the field management of these crops in the later stages so that they can surpass wheat, catch up with rice, and keep pace with potatoes, ensuring an all-round bumper harvest of grain crops.

This conference was convened by the Ministry of Agriculture. The nine provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Gansu, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have a coarse grain planting area that accounts for more than 80% of the country's total. Currently, these regions' coarse grain crops are growing very well, showing signs of a bumper harvest. However, various localities have reported that many areas favor high-yield crops, believing that sorghum and millet yields are not high, leading to a relaxation of field management. In response to this situation, the conference first analyzed and studied the significance of increasing the production of these crops. From a national perspective, corn, sorghum, and millet account for 45% of the autumn crop planting area, while the planting ratio in the Northeast, North China, and Northwest regions averages over 60%-70%. Therefore, ensuring a bumper harvest of these crops will play a significant role in achieving a great leap forward in agricultural production in various regions or the country. From an economic value perspective, these crops are not only one of China's main grains but also an indispensable raw material in industrial construction. These crops also have a strong ability to resist disasters. Various regions have rich experience in planting these crops. After discussion, everyone believed that the potential for increasing the production of millet and sorghum is great. Last year, the average per-mu yield of millet and sorghum in the country was higher than that of wheat, and there was a high-yield record of more than 1,400 jin per mu. Therefore, it is incorrect to regard millet and sorghum as low-yield crops. The conference proposed to remove the label of low yield for millet and sorghum and to thoroughly change the old concepts from people's thinking and practical work, striving to turn low yield into high yield and achieve an all-round great leap forward.

In order to promote millet and sorghum to advance side by side with high-yield crops such as corn and achieve a bumper harvest for everything, the conference, through on-site visits, exchanged the experience of Gaoping County in ensuring bumper harvests of crops such as millet and sorghum. Gaoping County's conditions are not considered good in Shanxi, but because it attaches importance to the comprehensive increase in production of various crops, the per-mu yield of grain has increased year after year during the first five-year plan period. Last year, the county's average per-mu yield reached 300 jin, and this year there will be a great leap forward. The conference also introduced the experience of other regions in increasing coarse grain production.

The conference believes that the period from now to the autumn harvest is a decisive key to ensuring that low yield turns into high yield and an all-round bumper harvest. The representatives of various regions studied and decided to work hard and specially from six aspects until the bumper harvest. First, add water and fertilizer to ensure that autumn crops are well-fed and watered. Second, cultivate and till the soil in a timely manner to achieve loose soil and strong seedlings, with no weeds in the fields. Third, prevent all natural disasters, prevent insects without insects, and treat insects if there are insects, remove diseased plants in a timely manner, strengthen flood and waterlogging prevention, and fully mobilize hunting to protect fields in mountainous areas. Fourth, fully carry out artificial assisted pollination of corn. Fifth, carefully harvest and thresh, returning every grain to the home, to achieve a bumper harvest. Sixth, secretaries take the lead, mobilize the whole people, assign responsibilities at all levels, and contract tasks, to carry out a great assault, great collaboration, great inspection, and great evaluation movement in later-stage field management, to ensure that every plot is upgraded and every mu increases production.

The conference also studied the issue of preparing for an even greater leap forward in the production of millet, sorghum, and corn next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st: More than 500 million mu of coarse grain crops such as millet, sorghum, and corn in northern China are currently growing very vigorously, greatly exceeding previous years. Most of these crops in the three northeastern provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have already formed ears, and most of the North China region and the Huanghuai River basin have begun to tassel and bloom. In order to welcome the autumn bumper harvest, the peasants in various regions are becoming more and more vigorous, strengthening later-stage field management, and striving for an all-round leap forward and a bumper harvest for everything.

This year, these crops were generally sown early, deeply cultivated, and densely planted, and basically popularized with improved varieties. The area of improved varieties in most provinces has reached 80%-90%. Applying 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu has become a common phenomenon. In the past, many areas in the Northeast did not apply fertilizer when planting millet, sorghum, and corn, but this year most of them have achieved "full fertilization." Due to the adoption of crop ranking and classification and the implementation of a field management responsibility system, the management work is timely and meticulous, exceeding any previous year. According to surveys in Shanxi, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia, first-class fields generally account for 70% of millet, sorghum, and corn crops, second-class fields account for 20%, and third-class fields account for about 10%.

This year's unprecedented bumper harvest of wheat in various regions has broken the traditional saying that wheat is a low-yield crop, giving people great enlightenment. Recently, various regions have generally proposed to work hard for dozens of days and double the implementation of production increase measures, striving for millet, sorghum, and corn to advance side by side with other crops.

### 摘掉杂粮低产的帽子  加强田间后期管理是保证作物样样丰收的关键

    摘掉杂粮低产的帽子
    加强田间后期管理是保证作物样样丰收的关键
    新华社太原21日电  我国杂粮主要产区北方十省区最近在山西高平县举行谷子、高粱、玉米增产现场促进会议，决定千方百计加强这些作物的田间后期管理，让它们超小麦，赶水稻，追薯类，确保粮食作物全面大丰收。
    这次会议由农业部召开。参加会议的河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西、吉林、辽宁、黑龙江、甘肃九省和内蒙古自治区，杂粮种植面积占全国杂粮种植面积的80％以上。目前这些地方的杂粮作物长得很好，已呈现出丰收景象。但是各地反映许多地区喜爱高产作物，认为高粱、谷子的产量不高，有放松田间管理现象。会议针对这种情况，首先分析研究了这些作物的增产意义。从全国来看，玉米、高粱、谷子占秋季作物种植面积45％，而东北、华北、西北地区的种植比例平均达到60％—70％以上。因此，保证这些作物丰产对各地或全国实现农业生产大跃进会起很大作用。从经济价值讲，这些作物不仅是我国的主要粮食之一，而且是工业建设中不可缺少的原料。这些作物的抗灾能力也很强。各地对种植这些作物都有着丰富的经验。经过讨论，大家认为谷子、高粱的增产潜力是很大的。去年全国谷子、高粱的平均亩产量比小麦高，并且出现过亩产一千四百多斤的高产纪录。因此把谷子、高粱看作低产作物是不正确的。会议提出要为谷子、高粱摘掉低产帽子，要从人们的思想和实际工作中彻底改变旧观念，力争低产变高产，实现全面大跃进。
    为了促使谷子、高梁与玉米等高产作物齐头并进，样样丰收，会议通过现场参观，交流了高平县保证谷子、高粱等作物丰收的经验。高平县在山西来说条件不算好，但是由于重视各项作物全面增产，在第一个五年计划时期，粮食亩产量连年上升，去年全县平均亩产量已达到三百斤，今年将有很大跃进。会议还介绍了其他地区的杂粮增产经验。
    会议认为，从现在到秋收，是保证低产变高产、全面大丰收的决定关键。各地代表研究决定要大干特干，从六个方面苦战，直到大丰收。第一，加水加肥，保证秋作物吃饱喝足。第二，及时中耕培土，达到土松苗壮，地无杂草。第三，防止一切自然灾害，无虫防虫，有虫必治，及时拔除病株，加强防洪防涝，山区要全面发动打猎保田。第四，全面开展玉米人工辅助授粉。第五，精收细打，颗粒还家，达到丰产丰收。第六，书记挂帅，全民动员，层层负责，分工包干，开展后期田间管理大突击、大协作、大检查、大评比运动，保证块块升级、亩亩增产。
    会议对及早准备明年谷子、高粱、玉米生产更大跃进的问题也作了研究。
    新华社太原21日电  北方五亿多亩谷子、高粱、玉米等杂粮作物目前生长非常茂盛，大大超过往年。东北三省和内蒙古自治区的这些作物大部分已孕穗，华北地区和黄淮流域一带大部开始吐穗扬花。各地农民为了迎接秋季大丰收，干劲越来越旺盛，正加强后期田间管理，力争全面跃进，样样丰收。
    今年这些作物普遍播种早、耕的深、种的密，基本上普及了良种，大部分省良种面积已达到80％—90％。亩施万斤肥料已成普遍现象。东北很多地区过去种谷子、高粱和玉米不施肥料，今年大部分实现了“满粪化”。各地由于采取作物排队分类，贯彻田间管理责任制度，管理工作及时细致，超过了任何一年。据山西、吉林、内蒙古调查，谷子、高粱、玉米作物一类田一般占70％，二类田占20％，三类田约占10％。
    今年各地小麦空前大丰收，打破了小麦是低产作物的传统说法，给予人们很大启示。最近各地普遍提出苦战几十天，加倍地贯彻增产措施，力争谷子、高粱、玉米与其他作物齐头并进。
