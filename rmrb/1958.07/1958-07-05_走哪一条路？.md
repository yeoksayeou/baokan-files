Which Road to Take?
Huang Changlu

Whether scientific research should serve production or not is a question that has been debated fiercely in China's scientific community during the rectification campaign. Those with bourgeois individualistic ideas often put forward this or that reason to oppose the principle that scientific undertakings must directly or indirectly serve production. They say that if scientific research goes to serve production, it will affect the prosperity and development of scientific undertakings. This argument cannot stand scrutiny. The news about the Jingdong Lac Insect Work Station of the Yunnan Biological Expedition Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences published in this newspaper today once again shatters this argument with facts.

When this work station deviated from the principle of serving production and engaged in research based on personal interests, although they possessed superior working conditions and the latest instruments and equipment, the research work was always lifeless, the researchers felt empty and depressed, and the future looked bleak. After the Party led them back from the wrong path to the correct road of serving production, the research work immediately showed a vibrant scene. In fact, the reason is very simple: all science directly or indirectly serves the struggle for production or class struggle, especially those industrial and agricultural technical sciences that come directly from production and serve production. The relationship between technical sciences and production practice is even closer. Once technical science is separated from production practice, the masses will inevitably have no interest in their research, nor will the masses have data and experience to supply. The researchers themselves will also feel isolated, feel cold and lonely, and see no significance in their work, like trees without roots, water without a source, gradually withering and decaying. Conversely, if technical science is closely integrated with production and serves production, it can draw sufficient nourishment from practice and obtain great impetus. When researchers go deep into the reality of production, the masses are extremely concerned and will inevitably receive strong support from the masses; at the same time, the masses possess rich production experience, which can provide researchers with a basis and reference for research; therefore, once their research work is combined with production practice, it immediately becomes vibrant and achieves twice the result with half the effort. Their research will also prosper and grow with the development of production, and in turn promote production to move forward.

Whether scientific research can embark on the road of serving production depends on the leadership of the Party. Because the Party is guiding the entire people forward and struggling for the interests of the entire people. What are the most fundamental interests of the people at present? It is the great development of production. Therefore, the Party always guides people to put collective interests and long-term interests first, and guides people to serve production more effectively. At the same time, the Marxist-Leninist party understands the dialectical relationship between production and science, and adheres to the correct direction of science serving production. When bourgeois intellectuals are blinded by personal fame and gain, the Party must point out the direction to them and guide them to the correct path.

In the past three years, the Jingdong Lac Insect Work Station spent 500,000 yuan of national funds, wasted a lot of manpower and material resources, and brought a lot of losses to the research work. What they bought was an important lesson: once scientific research deviates from the leadership of the Party and deviates from the road of serving production, it enters a dead end. Scientific research accepts the leadership of the Party, clarifies the purpose of research, and serves production directly or indirectly, only then can it have a broad future and flourish.

    走哪一条路？

    科学研究要不要为生产服务？是我国科学界在整风中争论得颇为热烈的问题。抱有资产阶级个人主义思想的人，往往抬出这种或那种理由来反对科学事业必须直接或间接为生产服务的方针。他们说，科学研究如果去为生产服务，就会影响科学事业的繁荣发展。这个论点是经不住一驳的。今天本报发表的中国科学院云南生物考察队景东紫胶虫工作站的新闻，再一次用事实粉碎了这种论点。
    当这个工作站脱离了为生产服务的方针而根据个人兴趣去从事研究的时候，尽管他们拥有优越的工作条件，最新的仪器设备，但研究工作一直死气沉沉，研究人员感到空虚苦闷，前途暗淡无光；当党把他们从迷途中引回到为生产服务的正确道路以后，研究工作立即出现了生气勃勃的局面。其实道理也很简单，任何科学都是直接或间接地为生产斗争或阶级斗争服务的，特别是那些大量的直接来自于生产和服务于生产的工业技术科学和农业技术科学，它们与生产实践的关系更紧密。技术科学一旦离开了生产实践，群众对他们的研究就必然没有兴趣，群众也没有资料经验可供给，研究者本身也就感觉到孤立，感觉到冷冷清清，看不到工作的意义，犹如无根之木，无源之水，逐渐枯竭萎落；反之，如果技术科学紧密与生产结合，为生产服务，就能从实践中吸取充分的养料，得到巨大的动力。当研究人员深入生产实际的时候，群众极为关怀，必然受到群众的大力支持；同时群众中蕴藏着丰富的生产经验，可以供给研究人员作研究的根据和参考；因此他们的研究工作一经和生产实践结合，马上生气勃勃，事半功倍。他们的研究也就会随着生产的发展而繁荣壮大，反过来又推动生产向前发展。
    科学研究能不能走上为生产服务的道路？关键在于党的领导。因为党是引导着全体人民前进，为全体人民的利益而奋斗的。当前人民的最根本的利益是什么？是生产的大发展。因此党总是引导人们把集体利益长远利益放在第一位，引导着人们更有效地为生产服务。同时，马克思列宁主义的政党，通晓生产与科学之间的辩证关系，坚持科学为生产服务的正确方向。在资产阶级知识分子被个人名利迷了心时，党就要向他们指明方向，引导他们走向正确的道路。
    景东紫胶虫工作站三年来花了国家五十万元经费，浪费了许多人力、物力，给研究工作带来了不少的损失，买来的是一条重要的教训：科学研究一旦脱离了党的领导，离开了为生产服务的道路，就走进了死胡同，科学研究接受党的领导，明确研究的目的，直接地或间接地为生产服务，才能海阔天空，欣欣向荣。
