See Who's Powerful, See Who's Arrogant!
    Méi Bìhuá

The U.S. imperialist aggressor troops landed on the southern coast of Lebanon on July 15th. This is an act of aggression against the people of Lebanon, against the Arab people. At the same time, the U.S. Strategic Air Command announced that air forces at various operational bases had entered a so-called "state of alert"; the U.S. Fleet Headquarters announced that all fleets stationed in the Atlantic and Pacific had entered a "state of readiness to take action within four hours"; all ships of the U.S. Pacific Fleet stationed in Pearl Harbor were "prepared for the expansion of war"; all air, land, and logistical forces stationed in Japan and Europe were also in a "pre-alert status" or "alert status"...

Look at the face of the aggressor, so "powerful," so "arrogant," quite the posture of fanning flames everywhere, setting fires everywhere, determined to fight to the end against all peace-loving people of the world.

However, we must also look at the other side: on the southern coast of Lebanon, a Lebanese boy of about ten years old, facing the landing American troops, swore: "We are Arabs, we will definitely drive them back."

This child's bold words are truly awe-inspiring and truly arrogant!

This child has seen through a truth: you American troops, don't put on airs, don't stand on various military bases from the Pacific to the Atlantic looking arrogant, don't all enter "states of alert" from Tokyo to Bonn, you are just paper tigers!

This paper tiger has long been disgraced. In the late stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan and before 1949, it ran rampant in China; but now, alas, where is it now! In the autumn and winter of 1950, this paper tiger once again "strutted" all the way from central Korea to the Yalu River; but wasn't it exposed?

In the past year or two, the United States has been peddling the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East, on the one hand, excluding the influence of British and French imperialism, and on the other hand, supporting political garbage like Chamoun, Said, and Hussein everywhere, and the overall aggressive goal is to make the United States ride on the heads of the Arab people and dominate. The Lebanese people's uprising and the Iraqi revolution are two resounding slaps in the face to the "Eisenhower Doctrine." So, the United States couldn't hold back, so, the United States sent aggressive troops. Does this ultimately prove who is strong and who is weak? The United States possesses some aggressive bases, while Lebanon possesses the justice and support of the people of the world, and the anti-imperialist fighting spirit and determination.

Please, Lebanese friends, listen to the statements of our government and the Soviet government, please listen to the angry shouts of the masses on Tiananmen Square.... You and we, together, hold a magnificent moral force, and the American paper tiger will once again reveal its true colors.

    看谁威风，看谁神气！
    梅碧华
    美帝国主义的侵略军队在7月15日爬上黎巴嫩南部海岸。这是和黎巴嫩人民、和阿拉伯人民为敌的侵略行动。与此同时，美国战略空军司令部宣布，各个作战基地上的空军进入所谓“警戒状态”；美国舰队总部宣布，驻在大西洋和太平洋的全部舰队进入“四小时以内可以采取行动的戒备状态”；驻在珍珠港的美国太平洋舰队的全部舰只“已经为战事的扩大作好了准备”；驻在日本和欧洲的全部空军、陆军、后勤部队也都处于“戒备前的状态”或“警戒状态”……
    看这侵略者的嘴脸，好“威风”，好“神气”，颇有到处煽风、到处点火，决心和全世界爱好和平的人民斗争到底的姿态。
    但是，我们还得看看另外一面：在黎巴嫩南部海岸，有一个十多岁的黎巴嫩小孩子，面对登陆的美军发誓道：“我们是阿拉伯人，我们一定把他们打回去。”
    这个孩子的豪言壮语才是真正威风凛凛，真正神气十足！
    这个孩子看透了一个真理：你们美军不要装模作样，你们不要从太平洋到大西洋站在各个军事基地上神气活现，你们不要从东京到波恩全部进入“警戒状态”，你们不过是纸老虎！
    这只纸老虎早就丢过丑。在抗日战争末期到1949年以前，它曾在中国横行霸道；而今，唉，而今安在哉！在1950年秋冬，这只纸老虎又曾从朝鲜中部一直“威风”到鸭绿江边；然而，它还不是被戳穿了吗？
    一两年来，美国在中东贩卖“艾森豪威尔主义”，一方面排斥英法帝国主义的势力，一方面到处扶植像夏蒙、赛义德、侯赛因一类的政治垃圾，而总的侵略目标是要使美国骑在阿拉伯人民的头上称王称霸。黎巴嫩人民的起义和伊拉克的革命，正是对“艾森豪威尔主义”的两记响亮耳光。于是，美国按捺不住了，于是，美国出动侵略军队了。这到底是在证明谁强呢，谁弱呢？美国拥有一些侵略基地，而黎巴嫩拥有的是全世界人民的正义和支持，反帝国主义的斗志和决心。
    请黎巴嫩的朋友们听听我国政府和苏联政府的声明，请你们听听天安门广场上群众愤怒的呼声……。你们和我们，一同掌握着雄伟无比的道义力量，美国纸老虎是会再一次地现出原形的。
