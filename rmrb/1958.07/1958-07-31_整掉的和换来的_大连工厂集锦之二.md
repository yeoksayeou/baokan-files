What Was Discarded and What Was Gained
—A Collection of Dalian Factories, Part Two
Zheng Zhong

Since the rectification campaign, the forging workshop of the Dalian Shipyard has undergone significant transformations in the thinking and work style of its cadres, and a marked improvement in the political awareness of its workers and masses, through big contending, big blooming, big-character posters, big debates, big comparisons, and the Great Leap Forward. Currently, the workshop's morale is exceptionally high, the mood is buoyant, and the spirit is vigorous. Technological innovations are springing up like mushrooms after rain, and production quotas are being revised daily.

      Experienced a Revolution of Thought
In the past, workers in this workshop often argued. There were several times a week when workers would argue over the use of tools and the large furnace. Previously, when using tools, no one was willing to lend them to others, and they would lock them in their own "small warehouse" after work. Sometimes, when someone urgently needed them, they would have to break open the box and steal them, and workers often argued over these matters. It was the same with the use of the large furnace; no one was allowed to encroach on anyone else's space, and sometimes, if someone used a little too much space, the two sides would argue endlessly. Why? The problem was simple: because it would affect individual income. Now, things are very different. For a long time, workers in this workshop have not been heard arguing over the use of tools and the large furnace. Now, workers' "small warehouses" are not locked, and some people even voluntarily take out their tools to lend to those who need them. For example, in early June, when Li Daowen went to Zhang Yujin, who was previously most unwilling to lend tools, to borrow a swage for iron forging, Zhang Yujin thought that using a "swage" required the use of a "groove" and a "kenzi," so he voluntarily found these two tools and lent them to Li Daowen.

Those who waste materials are seen as the most despicable people. In the past, wasting materials was seen as commonplace. Many people in the past did not consider how to save materials when using them, but rather how to make it convenient, effortless, and smooth, thus causing waste of raw materials. Worker Sun Shaokun said: "In the past, we determined the work based on the material, now we determine the material based on the work," so there used to be a lot of material scraps, but now there are fewer. Anyone who produces work that shouldn't have material scraps is seen as the most despicable person. Worker Liang Zuoxiang said: Now, if there are material scraps, even without others saying anything, I feel my face burning.

This change was not easy; everyone experienced a revolution of thought in the rectification campaign. The ideological transformation of the old worker Yan Tongda is a typical example. On the evening of June 13, when the inspection team sought to understand the rectification situation in the workshop from the old worker Yan Tongda, he painfully recounted his transformation process to the comrades of the inspection team. He began by saying: "I am sorry to the Party, if it were not for the rectification campaign, I might have turned into something else." He said: "I used to be very backward, often arguing about wages, fighting over quotas, complaining, and saying strange things. Whenever I encountered something I was not satisfied with, I would curse in the streets. As a result, I worked sloppily. In the past, I worked as if 'buying fish without caring about selling shrimp,' 'stoking the fire without caring about hammering,' just getting through the day." He said: "At that time, I was 'standing in the flowers without knowing their fragrance,' forgetting the hardships of the old society. Since the 'Double Anti' movement began, through the debate of 'for whom do we labor,' and seeing the ungrateful exhibition of Yang Chengxin in the shipbuilding turbine workshop, I realized that I was wrong in the past, and I was truly sorry to the Party. During the rectification campaign, the leaders also voluntarily examined their three styles and five airs, which moved me greatly. 'Now, my heart is blooming like a flower, I don't know where such great energy comes from.'" When people's thinking is resolved, their enthusiasm also comes. On the first night when the forging workshop mobilized workers to conduct mass inspection, rectification, and production, after the meeting, Yan Tongda found Comrade Che Ruqi, the secretary of the workshop's Party branch, and said: "Comrade Che, I feel really happy now. I used to make anchor chain hearts, and now I can make two thousand a day. Tomorrow, I want to find a way to make three thousand." At that time, Comrade Che said: "Good, if you can make three thousand, I will send you a commendation." The next day, Yan Tongda indeed made three thousand and said that he could still improve, requesting the workshop leaders to reduce his quota. Although there was only one Yan Tongda in the forging workshop, there were more than just one person like Yan Tongda in the past. Through the rectification campaign, these people have all undergone transformations. From a few specific events in the forging workshop, it can be seen that the thinking of the workers has undergone tremendous changes through the rectification campaign.

What changes have taken place in the leadership?

Leadership Style and Mass Assessment
The following doggerel poem is the assessment made by the masses of the forging workshop for the workshop's leading cadres through the rectification campaign.

The rectification movement has achieved results,
The three styles and five airs have vanished.
The work style of the cadres has greatly changed,
And the workers and masses are all satisfied.
            ×　×　×　×
In the past, one-chief system was implemented,
Cadres' eyes became swollen.
The power of the masses was not seen,
And they sat in their offices being bureaucratic.
The work style was not thorough,
And orders and official documents became the trend.
Their butts were dedicated to swivel chairs,
And they came up with ideas behind closed doors.
Some work was not done well,
And they listened to rumors and acted accordingly.
They helped little in solving difficulties,
And they were as thunderous in their tempers.
            ×　×　×　×
The rectification movement is a thunderbolt,
And the three styles and five airs hit the wall.
Everyone comes up with ideas for problems,
And workers and cadres are united as one.
The power of the masses is unparalleled,
And the mass line is number one.
They put down their airs and become students,
And learn from the masses.
They walk out of their small offices,
And leave their soft swivel chairs.
They go to be apprentices to the workers,
And delve into the details of production.
Cadres cultivate experimental plots,
And the workers are even more enthusiastic when they see it.
Cadres visit workers' homes,
And cadres and the masses become one family.
They have a truly comprehensive grasp of the situation,
And everyone discusses the problems together.
The work style of the cadres has greatly changed,
And the workers are all smiling.
Cadres take the lead and run ahead,
And the workers follow closely behind.
Ten thousand horses gallop in the Great Leap Forward,
And production dares to compare with rockets.

During this rectification and production inspection, the workers and masses of this workshop expressed great satisfaction with the improvement of leadership style and the reform of rules and regulations. There are three satisfactions with the leadership style: discussing matters with the masses; taking the lead in setting examples; and dropping airs and mingling with the masses. The workers said that now, no matter what happens, the leaders consult with us beforehand and then do it, which is truly letting the workers be the masters of their own affairs! Sun Shaokun said: "In the past, the distribution of bonuses was decided by the leaders. They decided who would get how much, and every time the bonuses were distributed, the workers were not satisfied, because some who should not have been given were given, and those who should have been given were not given. Now it's not like that, the workers have to discuss it themselves. This way of distribution, the workers have no objections."

In the past, the workshop leaders would first propose a compression coefficient for revising the work-hour quotas, then uniformly reduce the quotas according to the compression coefficient, and then hand them over to the masses for discussion. This time, the work tickets and blueprints were all handed over to the workers, asking the workers to discuss item by item how much should be compressed. At the beginning, some people in the workshop were worried that this approach would not be able to complete the task. However, the result of the workers' discussion was not only to complete the task, but also to compress the work hours by more than 30%.

The workshop's leading cadres played a model role in participating in labor. When they went down, they listened to the assignment of the work sections and groups, and when they were working, they took on the tasks that the workers were unwilling to do themselves. For example, one day when the Party branch secretary went to Wang Defu's group to participate in labor, this group was making flange disks, and there were two kinds of materials used, one large (more than a hundred catties) and one small. The secretary went to carry the large one, and the workers asked him to carry the small one. He insisted on carrying the large one. The workers were first worried and then moved. Many workers generally praised that the cadres now have no airs. Some workers said: "In the past, you couldn't find them even if something happened. Even if you found them, the cadres still had three magic weapons - pushing, delaying, and suppressing." The old worker Song Dianqing said: "In the past, there was feed in the trough, but the donkey would starve to death. Now, the transformation of the leaders is like a timely rain." Dropping airs is also reflected in the fact that cadres and the masses entertain together. In the past, cadres were together during entertainment, and workers were together. Now, there is no distinction between them.

Giving enthusiastic support to new things is also something that the workers in this workshop are very satisfied with. During the rectification process, they gave great support to various new things. For example, the old worker Zhang Fucai proposed that if the octagonal heating furnace was changed to a double-layer one, it could save a lot of fuel for the country. Based on this suggestion, the workshop changed the octagonal furnace to a double-layer one, with good results.

During the rectification movement, this workshop also reformed some unreasonable old rules and regulations, and the masses expressed great satisfaction. Initial Economic Achievements

People's moods are cheerful, and enthusiasm comes. Since the rectification movement, new people and new things have continued to emerge in this workshop. The ball bearing sleeves made for Wafangdian initially could only produce one hundred and eighty pieces per day. After repeated research by the workers, they can now produce two thousand five hundred pieces per day, but they are still studying how to improve. The crankshaft is the main product of this workshop. Before liberation, it took twenty-five days to forge one. In the early days of liberation, it still took fifteen days to make one. Until before the rectification, it could only make one a day. However, during the rectification process, this key was handed over to the masses. The workers repeatedly researched and changed from ten heats in the past to seven heats, and then to five heats. Currently, it only takes two heats to forge a crankshaft, and the daily output reaches four and a half. The completion of various indicators in this workshop is very good. The production targets have been overfulfilled every month this year. The attendance rate averaged 88.5% last year, and reached 95% from January to May this year. The scrap rate was 0.368% last year, and averaged 0.08% from January to May this year, and no scrap was produced in May. The above situation is only the initial achievement of the forging workshop. Recently, this workshop is revising their Leap Forward plan, and they are full of confidence in striving for greater achievements.

    整掉的和换来的
    ——大连工厂集锦之二
    郑重
    大连造船厂的锻工车间，自整风以来，通过大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大评比和大跃进，干部思想作风有了大转变，职工群众的政治觉悟有了显著的提高。目前，这个车间的群众情绪异常高涨，心情舒畅，朝气勃勃，干劲十足，技术革新像雨后春笋，生产定额日新月异。
      经历了一番思想革命
    这个车间的工人过去经常吵架，一个星期总有几次工人在为争着使用工具和大炉而吵架。过去在使用工具的时候，谁都不愿借给别人，下班后就把它锁在自己的
  “小仓库”里，有时有人急着用，就得砸开箱子偷用，工人之间常常为这些事吵架。使用大炉也是这样，谁也不准侵占谁的一点地方，有时候谁要多用了一点地方，双方就会吵个不休。为什么呢？问题很简单，因为这样会影响个人的收入。现在可大不相同了，好久以来听不到这个车间的工人在为使用工具和大炉而吵架。现在工人的“小仓库”不锁了，有的人还主动把工具拿出来借给有关的人使用。如6月初李道文去向过去最不愿出借工具的张玉金借打铁用的摔子，张玉金想，用“摔子”，必须用“槽”和“肯子”，于是他就主动又把这两种工具找出来借给了李道文。
    浪费材料的人被人看为最可耻的人。过去把浪费材料看做是习以为常的事，许多人过去在使用材料时不是考虑如何节约材料，而是考虑如何方便、省劲、顺手，所以，就造成原材料的浪费。工人孙少坤说：“过去是就料下活，现在是按活下料”，所以过去料头多，现在料头少。谁要出了不该出料头的活，就被人看做是最可耻的事。工人梁祚祥说：现在要出了料头不用别人说，自己也觉得脸上热乎乎的。
    这种改变，也并不是很容易的，每个人在整风中都经历了一番思想革命的过程。老工人阎通达的思想转变过程就是一个典型的例子。6月13日晚上，当检查组找老工人阎通达了解这个车间整风情况时，他沉痛地向检查组的同志叙说了他的转变过程。他开头就说：“我对不起党，要不是整风我不一定变成一个什么样的人。他说：我过去很落后，经常吵工资，争定额，发牢骚，说怪话，一遇到不满的事情，就骂大街，这样一来，我干活也吊儿郎当。我过去干活是‘买鱼不管卖虾的’，‘烧火不管打锤的’，干一天凑付一天。”他说：那时候我是“站在花中不知香”，忘记了旧社会的苦处，自从“双反”运动开始，通过“为谁劳动”的辩论，又看到造船轮机车间杨成信的忘本展览会，这时我才知道我过去错了，真对不起党。整风中，领导上又主动地检查自己的三风五气，使我很感动。“我现在心里像开了花似的，不知那来的这么大的劲”。当人的思想解决了，干劲也就来了。锻工车间第一天晚上发动工人进行群众性的检查整风和生产时，会后阎通达找到车间党支部书记车汝琦同志说：“车同志，我现在心里真痛快，我干的锚链心，现在一天干二千，明天我想法干三千”。当时车同志说：“好啊，你要干到三千个，我给你送喜报。”第二天，阎通达果然干了三千。并且说还能提高，要求车间领导上给他压缩定额。锻工车间虽然只有一个阎通达，可是过去像阎通达这样的人物还不只是一个。通过整风，这些人都有了转变。从锻工车间几件具体事看出，通过整风职工思想是起了极大的变化。
    领导上有些什么变化呢？
    领导作风和群众鉴定
    下边这首快板诗，是锻工车间群众给这个车间领导干部通过整风作的鉴定。
    整风运动有成绩，三风五气绝了迹。
    干部作风大转变，工人群众都满意。
            ×　×　×　×
    过去执行一长制，干部肿了下眼皮。
    群众力量看不到，坐在屋里发官气。
    工作作风不深入，命令、公文成风气。
    屁股专坐转圈椅，关在屋里出主意。
    有些工作作不好，听了风来就是雨。
    困难帮助解决少，有如雷霆发脾气。
            ×　×　×　×
    整风运动是霹雳，三风五气碰了壁。
    问题大家出主意，工人干部连一气。
    群众力量大无比，群众路线数第一。
    放下架子当学生，群众当中去学习。
    走出小小办公室，离开软软转圈椅。
    去给工人做徒弟，深入生产摸底细。
    干部种了试验田，工人看了更起劲。
    干部挨家访工人，干群变成一家人。
    情况掌握真全面，问题大家来合计。
    干部作风大转变，工人个个笑嘻嘻。
  干部带头前头跑，工人后面不松气。
    万马奔腾大跃进，生产敢跟火箭比。
    这个车间的职工群众在这次整风生产大检查中，对领导作风的改进和规章制度的改革表示非常满意。对领导作风有三满意：遇事和群众商量；带头做样板；打掉架子和群众打成一片。工人说，现在不管什么事，领导上都是事先和我们商量而后再做，这才真正叫工人当家做主人呢！孙少坤说：“过去分奖金是领导上说了算，他们说给谁多少就给谁多少，每次分完奖金工人不满意，因为有的不该分的分了，该分的没分。现在就不那样了，要工人自己讨论。这样分法工人就没有意见了”。
    这个车间过去修改工时定额是领导上先提出压缩系数，再按照压缩系数一律往下割，而后交给群众讨论。这次把工票和图纸全交给了工人，要工人一件一件讨论应该压缩多少，开始时车间有些人耽心用这种作法完不成任务。但是，工人讨论的结果，不仅完成，而且能压缩工时30％以上。
    车间领导干部，在参加劳动中起了模范作用，在下去时听从工段和小组的分配，在劳动时挑工人不愿干的活自己干。如有一次党支部书记到王德福小组参加劳动这天，这个组干法蓝盘，用的料有两种，一种大的（一百多斤），一种小的，支书去搬大的，工人叫他搬小的，他一定要大的，工人先是担心，后是感动，许多工人普遍称赞现在干部没有架子了。有的工人说：过去有了事你找都找不到，就是找到了干部还有三个法宝——推、拖、压。老工人宋殿卿说：过去是槽里有料饿不死驴，现在是领导转变好比及时雨。打掉架子表现在另一个方面是干部和群众同娱乐，过去娱乐时干部在一起，工人在一起，现在是不分彼此。
    对新事物给予热情的支持，这也是这个车间工人很满意的一件事。他们在整风过程中，对各种新事物给予极大的支持。如老工人张富财提出八角加热炉如果改为双层的，可为国家节约大量燃料，这个车间就根据这一建议，把八角炉改成了双层的，效果良好。
    在整风运动过程中，这个车间对一些不合理的陈规旧制也进行　改革，群众表示极大的满意。初获经济战果
    人们的心情舒畅了，干劲就来了。这个车间自整风运动以来，新人新事不断出现。给瓦房店承制的滚珠套，开始时每天只能生产一百八十个，经过工人反复研究，现在可达到日产二千五百个，但他们还在研究提高。曲拐轴是这个车间的主要产品，解放前是二十五天锻一个，解放初期也还要十五天干一个，直到整风前还只能一天干一个。但在整风过程中，把这个关键交给了群众，工人反复研究，由过去十火改为七火，进而改为五火，目前只要二火就可锻成一根曲拐轴，日产达到四根半。这个车间各项指标的完成得很好。生产指标今年月月超额完成。出勤率去年平均达88.5％，今年1至5月达95％，废品率去年是0.368％，今年1至5月平均是0.08％，而5月份一件废品也没出。上述情况仅是锻工车间初获的战果。最近，这个车间又在修改他们的跃进计划，他们信心百倍的要争取更大的成绩。
