Chongqing Strengthens Collaborative Education in Rectification

(Our newspaper, Chongqing, July 22nd) Chongqing recently, in light of the new situation after the central government devolved the management of a large number of factories and mines to local authorities and the establishment of inter-regional cooperation, vigorously strengthened the education of cadres and workers in the spirit of communist cooperation during the fourth stage of the rectification campaign.

Chongqing is an important industrial base in the Southwest region. At present, most of the factories and mines in the city that were originally managed by the central government have been devolved. After the establishment of inter-regional cooperation, Chongqing bears a heavy responsibility for supporting the industrial and agricultural construction of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces. The city is rushing to manufacture steelmaking and rolling equipment, including twenty-six sets of rolling equipment ranging from 10,000 to 50,000 tons, several seamless steel pipe machines, and a batch of machine tools, steelmaking electric furnaces, generators, and other equipment necessary for steel plants. This task was added on top of the repeated leaps forward in the production plans of various factories this year. In addition, factories and mines have to draw a considerable number of technical personnel to support various regions.

In mid-June, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) convened a meeting of the party secretaries and factory directors of key factories manufacturing this equipment to first conduct education on communist cooperation among responsible cadres. After fully recognizing the new situation and new tasks, many units stated that no matter how difficult or arduous the task, they would gloriously undertake the task of helping Yunnan, Guizhou, and other parts of the province develop industry as soon as possible. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC then convened an enlarged meeting of the Municipal Committee, which unanimously passed the "Oppose Localism, Vigorously Support the Industrial and Agricultural Construction of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan Province" resolution. The Municipal Committee decided to make the greatest determination, do everything possible, and selflessly support the development of industry in fraternal regions. This support includes the supply of equipment, the transfer and training of technical personnel, and other aspects. To avoid duplicating efforts with other regions and to better undertake various support tasks, Chongqing's factories will develop production of advanced, specialized, cutting-edge, and precision products, and vigorously improve their technical level and ability to manufacture new equipment. Based on this requirement, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC has made preliminary arrangements for the future development goals of relevant factories and mines throughout the city. For example, Chongqing Air Compressor Factory and other units have begun to expand into heavy machinery factories, capable of producing large machine parts weighing fifty to sixty tons. Facts have proven that supporting fraternal regions not only does not hinder the development of the city's industry, but also greatly promotes the development and improvement of industry throughout the city.

The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC determined that all units throughout the city should take opposing localism and promoting communist cooperation as an important part of the fourth stage of the rectification campaign, so that every cadre and worker can recognize their responsibilities. The Secretary of the Municipal Committee personally delivered reports to more than 4,000 section-level and above party member cadres throughout the city and workers from Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and other units. Several steel plants that undertook heavier support tasks held special meetings to seriously arrange and discuss current tasks and how to cultivate new technical forces after transferring technical personnel. Wangjiang Machinery Factory launched a major debate on how to ensure the completion of the support tasks, eliminating some people's fear of difficulties. The factory's technical personnel formed four shock brigades to speed up the drafting of drawings and the design of technological processes. All forgings and castings for the first rolling mill have been manufactured and will soon be shipped.

Many units regard doing a good job in small-scale cooperation between factories as a prerequisite for doing a good job in large-scale cooperation with Yunnan and Guizhou. Chongqing Third Steel Plant had difficulties in manufacturing a set of equipment, and Chongqing Machine Tool Plant and other units drew technical personnel and equipment to actively assist. If one factory is unable to manufacture large equipment, the relevant factories will undertake a part of it according to their own characteristics, using collective strength to overcome difficulties together.

Inspired by the spirit of communist cooperation, workers in various factories are actively overcoming difficulties and striving to complete the task of supporting other regions. Chongqing Machine Tool Plant used to only produce gear machine tools with small tonnage and high precision, and most of its production equipment was medium and small-sized. This time, it suddenly increased the task of manufacturing twenty sets of rolling mills, with large parts and urgent deadlines, which presented many difficulties. After the workers understood the significance of this task, they were full of energy. It was originally expected that the first rolling mill would not be shipped until the end of August, but after discussion, the workers unanimously decided to regard supporting fraternal regions as the top priority and rush to manufacture it in July. After the tasks of many factories increased, they did not have time to expand their workshops, so the workers set up temporary sheds for production. When there was a shortage of large equipment, the workers used the method of "ants gnawing on bones" to concentrate small machine tools to do big jobs. In order to solve the difficulty of lacking raw materials such as copper and steel, all units carefully cleaned up their warehouses. Some people even donated copper basins and various copper utensils. Now, supporting Yunnan and Guizhou, and supporting the development of the iron and steel industry in various parts of the province has become the action slogan of the vast number of workers in the city.

### 全力支援云南贵州和四川各地发展工业  重庆在整风中加强协作教育

    全力支援云南贵州和四川各地发展工业
    重庆在整风中加强协作教育
    本报重庆22日电  重庆市最近针对中央大批厂矿下放地方管理和大区协作建立起来以后的新形势，在整风第四阶段对干部、职工大力加强了共产主义协作精神的教育。
    重庆是西南地区一个重要工业基地，目前全市原来由中央管理的大部分厂矿已经下放。重庆在大区协作建立以后，担负支援云南、贵州和本省工农业建设的任务很大。单是正在赶制的炼钢和轧钢设备，就有一万吨到五万吨的轧钢设备二十六套，无缝钢管机几套，以及一批机床、炼钢电炉、发电机等钢铁厂必需的设备。这批任务是在各厂今年生产计划一再跃进的情况下增加的。另外，各厂矿还要抽出相当一部分技术力量支援各地。
    6月中旬，中共重庆市委召集制造这批设备的各重点厂的党委书记、厂长开会，首先在负责干部中进行了共产主义大协作的教育。在充分认识了新的形势和新的任务以后，许多单位都表示：再困难，再艰苦，也要光荣地担负起帮助云南、贵州和省内各地尽快发展工业的任务。中共重庆市委紧接着又召开了市委扩大会议，一致通过了“反对本位主义，大力支援云南、贵州和本省工农业建设”的决定。市委决定，下最大决心，尽一切可能，无私地支援兄弟地区发展工业。这种支援包括供应设备、调给和训练技术力量等方面。为了避免同外地重复力量，更好地担负起各项支援任务，重庆的工厂将从生产高级、缺门、尖端性的、精密的产品方面发展，大力提高技术水平和制造新设备的能力。根据这一要求，中共重庆市委已经对全市有关厂矿今后的发展目标初步作了安排。例如，重庆空气压缩机厂等单位已开始扩建为重型机器厂，可以生产五十吨到六十吨重的大型机件。事实证明：支援各兄弟地区不仅不妨碍本市工业的发展，而且可以大大推动全市工业的发展和提高。
    中共重庆市委确定，全市各单位都要把反对本位主义，提倡共产主义大协作，作为第四阶段整风的重要内容，使每个干部、职工都认识自己的责任。市委书记亲自出马，分别向全市四千多科长级以上党员干部和重庆钢铁公司等单位的职工作了报告。担负支援任务较重的几个钢铁厂召开了专门的会议，对当前的任务和抽调技术人员以后如何培养新的技术力量，认真进行了安排和讨论。望江机器厂以如何保证完成支援任务为内容，展开大辩论，消除了一些人思想上的畏难情绪。全厂技术人员组成四个突击队，加紧赶绘图纸和进行工艺过程的设计。第一台轧钢机全部锻件和铸件都已制成，很快就可出厂了。
    许多单位把搞好各厂之间的小协作，作为搞好同云南、贵州大协作的前提。重庆第三钢铁厂承制一套设备有困难，重庆机床厂等单位就抽出技术力量和设备，积极援助。有些大设备一个厂无力制造，有关的厂就按照自己的特点，分别承担一部分，以集体力量，共同克服困难。
    在共产主义协作思想的鼓舞下，各厂职工都在积极克服困难，努力完成支援外地的任务。重庆机床厂过去只生产吨位小、精度高的齿轮机床，生产设备大部分是中、小型的，这次突然增加了制造二十套轧钢机的任务，部件大、时间急，有很多困难。职工们了解了这项任务的重大意义以后，个个干劲十足。原来预计到8月底第一套轧钢机才能出厂，经职工讨论，一致决定要把支援兄弟地区作为头等重要的任务，在7月份就要赶制出来。许多工厂任务加大后，来不及扩建厂房，工人们便搭起席棚生产。大的设备缺，工人们以“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，把小机床集中起来干大活。为了解决缺乏铜和钢材等原材料的困难，各单位都认真清理仓库。有些人还把铜盆、各种铜器献了出来。现在，支援云南、贵州，支援省内各地发展钢铁工业，已经成了全市广大职工的行动口号。
