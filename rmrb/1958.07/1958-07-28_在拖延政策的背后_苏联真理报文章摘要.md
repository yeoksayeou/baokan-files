Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 27th: The Soviet "Pravda" today, in an observer's article titled "Those Opposed to High-Level Talks Exposed," pointed out that the U.S. government is sparing no effort and resorting to all kinds of tricks and intrigues to delay the convening of a summit meeting.

The article said that although some American newspapers are trying to create the impression that the United States does not refuse to talk, but only intends to "buy time for preparation," the facts prove that other motives are hidden behind the policy of delay.

The "Pravda" article said that the United States has not proposed any date, not even an approximate date, for a meeting of heads of government within the framework of the Security Council. On the other hand, the U.S. and British forces have stepped up their concentration in the Middle East. The observer pointed out that it would be too naive to think that the entry of a large number of armed forces into a state of combat readiness is merely for the amusement of American and British generals. It is very clear that the issue lies in expanding the American and British aggression against Arab countries, first and foremost, an attack on the Republic of Iraq.

The article said that the fact of American aggression against Lebanon is undeniable. No matter what rhetoric the U.S. leaders use, they cannot hide this fact.

The observer pointed out that it is not surprising that the U.S. ruling clique is afraid of discussing their aggression against Arab countries at a high-level meeting as if they were afraid of fire. American newspapers do not conceal the fact that the United States will have to be in the position of the accused at this meeting and will find it difficult to find a defender for itself. Because the U.S. ruling clique is afraid of taking responsibility for aggression and preparing further attacks on Arab countries, it is trying to evade discussion of this issue and is trying to delay it with a lot of procedural issues so that the substance of the issue is not discussed. This is not a new trick. Everyone knows that seven months ago, when the Soviet Union suggested holding a summit meeting to ease international tensions, this was exactly the tactic the United States used at the time.

American newspapers do not hide the fact that Dulles very much wants to drown the main issue of the US-British aggression against Arab countries, which threatens world peace, in a whirlpool of existing and non-existent "problems." However, this issue is the most urgent and important one. The significance of convening a high-level meeting within the framework of the Security Council lies in peacefully resolving the problems of the Middle East and withdrawing American and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

The observer concluded that certain groups in the United States have adopted a policy of procrastination and sabotage with regard to holding a summit meeting within the framework of the Security Council. This policy is irreconcilable with the will of the people of all countries. Those who are engaged in sabotaging high-level meetings are provoking millions of well-meaning people in all countries. They expose themselves as enemies of peace and international security. They alone must bear full responsibility for the aforementioned actions.

    在拖延政策的背后
    苏联真理报文章摘要
    据新华社莫斯科27日电　苏联“真理报”今天在一篇题为“反对高级会谈的人原形毕露”的观察家的文章中指出，美国政府正在不惜采用一切手段和阴谋诡计来竭力拖延召开最高级会议。
    文章说，尽管有些美国报纸企图造成这样一种印象：仿佛美国并不拒绝会谈，而只是打算“争取时间进行准备”。但是事实证明，在拖延政策的背后隐藏着其他动机。
    “真理报”这篇文章说，美国没有提出在安理会范围内召开政府首脑会议的任何日期，甚至连大概日期也没有提出来，而另一方面，美国和英国军队却加紧在中近东集结。观察家指出，认为大批武装部队进入战斗准备状态仅仅是为了给美国和英国将军们消遣，那就太天真了。非常明显，问题在于扩大美国和英国对阿拉伯国家的侵略，首先是进攻伊拉克共和国。
    文章说，美国对黎巴嫩的侵略事实是无可争辩的。美国首脑们无论用怎样的花言巧语也掩饰不了这个事实。
    观察家指出，美国统治集团像怕火一样，害怕在高级会议上讨论他们侵略阿拉伯国家的问题，这并不奇怪。美国报纸毫不隐讳，美国在这个会议上将不得不处于被告的地位并且很难给自己找到辩护人。美国统治集团由于害怕承担侵略和准备进一步进攻阿拉伯国家的责任，企图规避讨论这个问题，并且企图用一大堆程序问题来拖延，使问题的实质得不到讨论。这并不是什么新花样。大家都知道，七个月以前，当苏联建议召开政府首脑会议以缓和国际紧张局势的时候，美国当时所使用的策略就正是这样。
    美国报纸毫不隐瞒地说，杜勒斯很想把威胁世界和平的美英侵略阿拉伯国家这一主要问题，淹没在这一大堆存在的和不存在的“问题”的漩涡之中。然而这个问题是最迫切最重要的问题。在安全理事会范围内召开高级会议的意义就在于要和平解决中近东的问题，并从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出美国和英国的军队。
    观察家最后说，美国某些集团对于在安全理事会范围内举行政府首脑会议采取了拖延和破坏的方针。这种方针同各国人民的意志是不相调和的。那些干着破坏高级会议勾当的人是在向各国千百万善良人士挑衅。他们暴露出自己是和平和国际安全的敌人。上述行动的全部责任只能由他们来担负。
