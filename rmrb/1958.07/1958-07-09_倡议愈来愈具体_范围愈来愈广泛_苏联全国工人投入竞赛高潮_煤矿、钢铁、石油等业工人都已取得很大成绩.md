Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 8th. A reporter from this agency reports: Workers and staff in various industrial sectors of the Soviet Union are enthusiastically launching a nationwide, mass socialist competition movement. The central content of this movement is to increase industrial labor productivity and reduce production costs. It is unfolding amidst a new situation of comprehensive and rapid development of Soviet industrial production and unprecedentedly high labor creativity among workers and staff.

    The characteristic of this socialist competition movement is that the content of the competition is more specific and has a more extensive mass character. This movement was initially launched by the mining team led by the famous miner Mamayev of the "Northern" No. 2 Mine in Voroshilovgrad Oblast, Donbas, in January this year. They proposed that each coal miner should overproduce one and a half tons of coal per shift. This new initiative is not only more specific in content than past general initiatives, making it easier to continuously check and promote its implementation, but also, as long as attention is paid to fully and rationally arranging working hours and improving production technology, any miner can overfulfill the daily production quota. Relying on this widespread mass competition movement can quickly increase output and labor productivity, which is more effective than relying solely on a portion of advanced producers to create new production records.

    The initiative of the Mamayev mining team quickly received enthusiastic responses from workers and staff in various regions and industrial sectors of the Soviet Union. The Korchik mining team of the Lutuqin Mine in Donbas, participating in the competition, further developed the initiative of the Mamayev team in March, proposing to guarantee that each miner would over-extract at least two tons of coal per shift, while also reducing the cost of each ton of coal by one ruble. In this way, the new initiative took the socialist production competition pioneered by the Mamayev team a step further.

    The socialist competition movement with new characteristics, initiated by the Mamayev and Korchik mining teams, has received great attention from Communist Party organizations at all levels and local party and government leaders in the Soviet Union. The Central Committees of the Communist Parties of Ukraine and Kazakhstan, as well as party organizations in Latvia, Leningrad, and other places, have made decisions requiring such competition to be carried out in all local industrial sectors. Comrade Khrushchev recently spoke highly of the Korchik team's initiative at the All-Union Industrial Exhibition. He pointed out that if all coal miners in the country implement this team's initiative, the funds saved for the country this year alone from reducing coal mining costs would be enough to build seven new mines with a total annual output of more than 4 million tons of coal.

    Due to the high production enthusiasm of the masses and the support of party and government leaders, the new socialist competition movement has quickly and enthusiastically unfolded throughout the Soviet Union. In addition to coal miners, workers and staff in steel, oil, machine manufacturing, textile, and other industrial sectors have also followed the example of the Mamayev and Korchik mining teams under the initiative of advanced enterprises in their respective industrial sectors and have generally launched competitions. Oil drilling workers across the Soviet Union responded to the initiative of the thirteen rapid drilling teams in the Tatar oil fields and launched a competition to increase drilling workload without increasing additional investment. Steel workers across the Soviet Union, pioneered by steel workers in Kuznetsk and Dneprodzerzhinsk, launched a competition to strive for early and overfulfillment of this year's production plan and greatly increase labor productivity.

    While enterprises within each industrial sector launched competitions with each other, heated competitions also unfolded between states and between economic regions. For example, the competition between the Azerbaijan economic region and the Georgian economic region, between Moldavia and Dagestan, between Estonia and Latvia, between Armenia and Tajikistan, and so on, were all very heated, which made the current stage of the Soviet socialist competition no longer limited to individual enterprises, but had a broader and more profound national character. In this competition, workers and staff in many enterprises across the Soviet Union put forward specific indicators for improving labor productivity and reducing production costs in each work shift. For example, many miners in various coal mines in the Rostov economic region guaranteed to produce one and a half tons of coal per shift above plan, and miners in a coal mine in the Urals even strived to overproduce five tons of coal per person per day. In the Soviet Union's largest iron ore mining enterprise—the Sokolov-Sarbay Mining Combine—many electric shovel operators guaranteed to over-excavate five or six hundred tons of iron ore per work shift above plan. Machine manufacturing workers in Leningrad proposed to save a certain amount of metal raw materials for the country for each machine and component produced. In realizing the competition guarantees, a large number of technical innovations and rationalization proposals emerged every month in various industrial sectors and economic regions of the Soviet Union.

    Judging from the news coming from various places, the nationwide socialist competition initiated by the Mamayev and Korchik mining teams has already achieved great results. For example, coal miners in the Ukrainian Republic had produced nearly one million tons of coal above plan for the country by the beginning of May. In the first two months after launching the competition, industrial enterprises in the Stalinino economic region saved the country 59 million rubles, several thousand tons of coal, metal, and tens of thousands of kilowatt-hours of electricity from reducing product costs. The Mamayev mining team also overfulfilled the original competition target by 200%. In the first five months of this year, they over-extracted 5,000 tons of coal. The Korchik team's competition conditions were also overfulfilled. In the first three months after the start of the competition, they each overproduced an average of two to three tons of coal per shift and reduced the cost of each ton of coal by more than two rubles.

    In the transportation industry, as well as in the steel, oil, and other industrial sectors, many enterprises have also achieved great results in improving productivity and reducing production costs in recent months. Railway workers in Donetsk also increased the average freight volume of many trains by more than 400 tons in February compared to January.

### 倡议愈来愈具体  范围愈来愈广泛  苏联全国工人投入竞赛高潮  煤矿、钢铁、石油等业工人都已取得很大成绩

    倡议愈来愈具体  范围愈来愈广泛
    苏联全国工人投入竞赛高潮
    煤矿、钢铁、石油等业工人都已取得很大成绩
    新华社莫斯科8日电  本社记者报道：苏联各工业部门的职工热烈展开了全国规模的、群众性的社会主义竞赛运动。这个运动的中心内容是提高工业劳动生产率和降低生产成本。它是在苏联工业生产全面飞速发展、职工群众的劳动创造积极性空前高涨的新局面下展开的。
    这次社会主义竞赛运动的特点是竞赛的内容更加具体，更加具有广泛的群众性。这一运动最初是由顿巴斯伏罗希洛夫格勒州“北方”二号矿井著名矿工马麦耶所领导的矿工工作队在今年1月间发起的，他们倡议每个采煤工人在每个工作班内都超额采煤一吨半。这一新倡议不但内容比过去一般的倡议更加具体，便于不断进行检查和推动其实现，而且只要注意充分合理地安排工作时间和改进生产技术，任何一个矿工都可能作到超额完成每天的生产定额；依靠这种广泛群众性的竞赛运动，可以迅速提高产量和劳动生产率，比单靠一部分先进生产者创造新的生产纪录更加有效。
    马麦耶矿工工作队的倡议很快就获得了苏联各地、各工业部门职工的热烈响应。参加竞赛的顿巴斯卢图金矿井的科尔契克矿工工作队在3月间又发展了马麦耶工作队的倡议，提出保证要使每个矿工在一个工作班内最少要超额开采两吨煤，同时要把每吨煤的成本降低一个卢布。这样一来，新倡议就把马麦耶队首倡的社会主义生产竞赛提高了一步。
    由马麦耶和科尔契克两个矿工工作队挑起的具有新特点的社会主义竞赛运动，受到了苏联共产党各级组织和各地党政领导的极端重视。乌克兰和哈萨克共和国的共产党中央委员会以及拉脱维亚、列宁格勒等地的党组织都作出决定，要求在当地一切工业部门中开展这样的竞赛。赫鲁晓夫同志不久以前在全苏工业展览会上讲话时曾经对科尔契克工作队的倡议给予极高的评价。他指出，如果全国煤矿工人都实现这个工作队的倡议，今年单是从降低采煤成本方面为国家节约的资金就足够建设总年产量达四百多万吨煤的七个新矿井。
    由于群众的高度生产积极性和党政领导的支持，新的社会主义竞赛运动很快就在苏联各地热火朝天地开展起来了。除煤矿工人以外，钢铁、石油、机器制造、纺织等工业部门的职工也在本工业部门先进企业单位的倡议下，纷纷效法马麦耶和科尔契克矿工工作队的榜样，普遍展开了竞赛。全苏联石油钻探工人响应鞑靼油田的十三个快速钻探队的倡议，展开了不增加额外投资而提高钻进工作量的竞赛。全苏联的钢铁工人在库兹涅茨克和第聂伯罗捷尔任斯基的钢铁工人首创下展开竞赛，争取提前和超额完成今年的生产计划并大大提高劳动生产率。
    在各工业部门内企业与企业之间展开竞赛的同时，州与州、经济区与经济区之间也展开了热烈的竞赛。例如，阿塞拜疆经济区和格鲁吉亚经济区之间、摩尔达维亚和达吉斯坦之间、爱沙尼亚和拉脱维亚之间、亚美尼亚和塔吉克之间等等，竞赛得都十分热烈，这就使得现阶段苏联的社会主义竞赛不再局限于个别企业之间，而具有了更广泛、更深刻的全民性质。在这个竞赛当中，苏联各地许许多多企业的职工都提出了要在每个工作班内提高劳动生产率和降低生产成本的具体指标。例如，罗斯托夫经济区各煤矿的许多矿工保证每个工作班要超计划生产一吨半煤，乌拉尔一个煤矿的矿工甚至要争取每人每天超额生产五吨煤。在苏联最大的铁矿企业——索科洛夫—萨尔巴伊采矿联合企业，有许多电铲机手保证要在每个工作班内超计划开采五、六百吨铁矿石。列宁格勒的机器制造工人提出每生产一部机器和部件都要为国家节省一定数量的金属原料。在实现竞赛保证当中，苏联各工业部门、各经济区每月都有大量的技术革新和合理化建议涌现出来。
    从各地传来的消息看来，由马麦耶和科尔契克矿工工作队挑起的全国规模的社会主义竞赛已经获得了很大的成绩。例如，乌克兰共和国的煤矿工人到5月初已经超计划为国家生产了将近一百万吨煤。斯大林诺经济区的工业企业在开展竞赛后的头两个月里，就从降低产品成本中为国家节约了五千九百万卢布、几千吨煤、金属和几万度电。马麦耶矿工工作队也以200％超额完成原来的竞赛指标，他们在今年头五个月中超额开采了五千吨煤。科尔契克工作队的竞赛条件也超额实现了。在竞赛开始后头三个月中，他们每个人每个工作班平均超额生产两、三吨煤，并且把每吨煤的成本降低两个卢布以上。
    在运输业以及钢铁、石油等工业部门中，许多企业最近几个月在提高生产率和降低生产成本方面也取得了很大成绩。顿涅茨铁路工人还在2月份就使许多列车的运货量平均比1月份增加四百吨以上。
