    Scientific Departments Collaborate
    Beijing Holds Scientific Research Supplies Exchange Fair
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Beijing recently held a scientific research supplies exchange fair embodying the spirit of great collaboration. Participating in the exchange fair were representatives from various scientific research institutions, universities, colleges, factories, mines, enterprises, and national defense scientific research departments in Beijing, as well as representatives from scientific research institutions in Tianjin, Harbin, Inner Mongolia, and other places. These units applied to supply a total of 1,678 items of materials. Through the exchange fair, 1,195 items were resolved, accounting for over 71% of the requested items. The problems solved by the three-day exchange fair were equivalent to twice the number of problems solved by the Beijing Scientific Research Supplies Supply Office in three months.
    During the exchange process, many units obtained urgently needed supplies. For example, the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences urgently needed nickel-chromium-tin steel rods for an important research project. Before the meeting, they had entrusted the Scientific Research Supplies Supply Service Department to handle it, but it could not be resolved. At the exchange fair, representatives from Peking University saw the institute's large-character poster requesting purchase and proactively provided support, solving the institute's problem.
    Another gain from the exchange fair was that it improved the relationships between various scientific research departments, laying the foundation for future mutual adjustment of surpluses and shortages.

    科学部门大协作
    北京举行科学研究用品交流会
    本报讯  北京最近举行了一次体现大协作精神的科学研究用品交流会。参加交流会的是在北京的各科学研究机关、高等学校、厂矿企业和国防科学研究部门的代表，以及来自天津、哈尔滨、内蒙古等地的科学研究机关的代表。这些单位申请供应的物资共计一千六百七十八件，通过交流会解决了一千一百九十五件，占申请数的71％多。三天的交流会所解决的问题等于北京市科学研究用品供应处三个月所解决的两倍。
    在交流过程中，许多单位得到了急需供应的物资。如中国科学院力学研究所的某项重要研究急需镍铬锡钢棒，会前曾经委托科学研究用品供应服务处办理，但是没法解决。在交流会上，北京大学代表看到该所的征购大字报以后，就主动予以支援，解决了该所的问题。
    交流会的另一个收获是沟通了各科学研究部门之间的关系，为今后的互相调剂有无打下了基础。
