“Songs on the Reservoir,” an artistic film produced by Changchun Film Studio, is a film worthy of attention. It timely reflects the scene of the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir and reflects the new people and new things in the construction.

This film possesses the spirit of our socialist era. This spirit is the spirit of our working people forging ahead dauntlessly and like a landslide. It moves us, and it has a kind of suction that attracts us. It makes people feel that the people and things here are so beautiful and full of endless power.

Isn’t that right? The story of the film "Songs on the Reservoir" may sound simple: Old farmer Grandpa Gu expects his son to return home for the Spring Festival to get married, but his son and his comrades in the army went to the Ming Tombs to build a reservoir. Grandpa Gu and his daughter-in-law Gao Lanxiang came to the construction site, and they both made achievements in their labor; Lanxiang and Gu Zhiqiang finally got married on the construction site. Such a story may not have much artistry, but such a story is precisely the true color of our socialist era and the concrete manifestation of the rising communist consciousness. This point is worth emphasizing. Just look at the young daughter-in-law Gao Lanxiang: how could there be any personal plans in her mind? Construction is a big deal, and personal matters are small. For her, this has long been a matter of course. Therefore, when the cooperative director told her to go to Beijing to get married, she immediately got angry and shouted: "What is this? The whole community is not resting during the Spring Festival. For the sake of the thousand-jin fields and the Great Leap Forward, our women's production team is working hard to dig a well on its own. At this juncture, I, the head of the women's production team and the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, am going to Beijing to get married. Don’t you think that is strange?" When she asked the reason, she was happy again when she learned that the community wanted her to go to the Ming Tombs construction site to learn technology and become a "student." This kind of spirit and the ideological feelings of the working people are common and typical things in our era. For Gao Lanxiang, what is the most beautiful and meaningful thing? That is labor! That is to devote herself to socialist construction!

From beginning to end, the film "Songs on the Reservoir" is showing such a soaring spirit of our working people! The film never deliberately complicates the characters' personalities, and Gao Lanxiang's personality shines in her simplicity. We see that as soon as she arrives at the construction site, Grandpa Gu asks her to rest, but as soon as Grandpa Gu turns around, she immediately can't help but run to the construction site to participate in labor. Grandpa Gu and Gu Zhiqiang are exactly the same as Lanxiang in this respect. Grandpa Gu wanted to see his son wholeheartedly and was initially somewhat dissatisfied that his son did not return home to get married, but as soon as he entered the construction site, he immediately started working, and he couldn't even bother to find his son. He is truly better than the old Huang Zhong back then! Gu Zhiqiang, this young man, agreed to leave the construction site to pick up his father and lover only after repeated persuasion from his leaders, but when he encountered a challenge with the migrant worker team, he had long forgotten about his personal affairs. Such dramatic plots constitute a picture of praising labor. This is simply incomparable to some of our films that add some vulgar love plots to create drama. It can be seen that the hearts of the filmmakers are in tune with the pulse of our socialist era. Therefore, it is possible for them to grasp the common characteristics of our working people and make the central idea very clear, reflecting the spirit of our times to a certain extent.

The Ming Tombs Reservoir has not yet been completed, but the film has already been made. This in itself is a new thing, indicating that film creation is also leaping forward. One of the reasons for the fast filming is that the film uses almost half of its length to record real-life scenes and characters. We can imagine that if the construction project is over and then re-arranged for filming, it will not only be time-consuming and costly; but how could it be possible to realistically reproduce these magnificent labor scenes like in the film? It is precisely the real labor scenes recorded in the film that give the film a strong atmosphere of life. Scenes such as Gu Zhiqiang and his comrades working on the construction site, and Gao Lanxiang's activities after going to the construction site, are arranged in the real and vast background of the construction site at that time. Even some famous figures, such as the "Jiulan Group," directly appear in the film. These would be very difficult or even impossible to reshoot later. This approach of directly throwing oneself into the torrent of construction will also inevitably powerfully infect and promote our creative workers. Take the actors in the film, such as Pu Ke and Zhang Guilan, who are indeed much better than some of the films they have recently acted in. The reason is also that the actors felt the atmosphere of this intense labor. We can also detect in the film that their performance in this film has an uncontrollable passion for life and labor. This change in creation is also worthy of attention.

### 值得重视的“水库上的歌声”

    值得重视的“水库上的歌声”
    王云缦
    长春电影制片厂摄制的艺术片“水库上的歌声”，是一部值得重视的影片。它及时地反映了十三陵水库建设的景象，反映了建设中的新人新事。
    这部影片具有我们社会主义时代的气派。这气派，就是我们劳动人民的一往直前、势如破竹的气派。它使我们感动，它有那么一股吸力吸引着我们。使人觉得这里的人和事，都那么美，都洋溢着无穷无尽的力量。
    不正是这样吗？影片“水库上的歌声”的故事听起来也许很简单：老农民谷大爷期望儿子能在春节回乡来结婚，儿子却和部队同志一起上十三陵修水库去了。谷大爷和儿媳妇高兰香一起来到了建设工地，他们在劳动上都作出了成绩；兰香和谷志强也终于在工地上结了婚。这样的故事，也许没有多大的艺术性，但是，这样的故事，却正是我们社会主义时代的本色，正是共产主义觉悟高涨的具体表现。这一点就是值得大书特书的。就看那年轻的媳妇高兰香吧：她头脑里哪有一点个人打算？建设事大，个人事小，在她来说，早就是天经地义的事了。所以，当合作社主任对她说，让她上北京去结婚时，她一下子就冒了火，嚷起来：“这叫干啥？全社春节都不休息，为了千斤田，大跃进，我们妇女生产队正干的来劲，要自己负责打一口井，在这个节骨眼上，我这个妇女生产队长，团支书，上北京去结婚，你说新鲜不新鲜？”等到问明情由，原来是社里要她上十三陵工地去学技术，当“留学生”，才转怒为喜。这种气概，这种劳动人民的思想感情，正是我们时代普遍而又典型的事情。对于高兰香来说，什么东西是最美、最有意义的呢？那就是劳动！那就是投身到社会主义建设中去！
    影片“水库上的歌声”从头到尾，都在表现我们劳动人民的这样一股冲天干劲！影片决不故意将人物性格复杂化，高兰香的性格正是在单纯中显出了光彩。我们看到：她一到工地，谷大爷招呼她休息，等谷大爷一转身，她立刻就忍不住地跑到工地参加劳动去了。谷大爷和谷志强，在这点上和兰香也完全一样。谷大爷一心想见到儿子，对儿子没回乡结婚，开始是有些不满，但一跨入工地，却立刻干起活来，儿子也顾不上找了。真是赛过当年老黄忠！谷志强这个年青小伙子，经过领导再三说服，才答应离开工地去接父亲和爱人，可是一碰上要和民工队挑战，个人的事又早就看在脑后了。这样的戏剧情节，构成了一幅歌颂劳动的图景。这和我们有的影片，为了制造戏剧性，乱添一些庸俗的恋爱情节等等，简直无法相比。可以看到，影片创作者们的心，是和我们的社会主义时代的脉搏合拍着的，因此，它才可能将我们劳动人民的这种共同的特点紧紧抓住，中心思想十分鲜明，在一定程度上反映了我们时代的精神面貌。
    十三陵水库尚未最后完工，影片就已经拍成了，这本身就是一件新事，说明了电影创作工作也在跃进。拍得快的原因之一，我看与影片几乎用了一半的篇幅来纪录真实生活的场景、人物有关。我们可以设想，要是建设工程结束了，再重新来布置拍摄，不仅费时费钱；而且，又如何可能像影片那样真实的再现这些宏伟壮观的劳动场景呢？正是影片中那些真实纪录下来的劳动场景，给了影片以浓厚的生活气息。像谷志强和战友们在工地劳动的场景，像高兰香去工地后的活动，都被安排在当时工地建设真实、辽阔的后景中，甚至一些著名人物如“九兰组”等，也直接出现在影片里。这些，要是后来补拍是有很大困难，甚至无法做到的。这种直接投身到建设洪流中去的做法，也必然会有力地感染和推动我们的创作工作者。就以影片的演员来说，如浦克、张桂兰等，确实要比他们最近演过的一些影片好得多。原因也在于演员们感受了这种紧张劳动的气氛。我们在影片中也可以觉察到：他们在这部影片中的表演，是有一种抑制不住的对生活、对劳动的激情，这个创作上的变化，也是值得重视的。
