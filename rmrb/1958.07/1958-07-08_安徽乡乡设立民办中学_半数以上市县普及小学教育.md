According to a report in the Anhui Daily, the movement to universalize primary education and for the masses to establish schools is flourishing throughout Anhui Province. To date, over half of the municipalities and counties in the province have basically achieved universal primary education. Thanks to the extensive and rapid development of civil-run middle schools, the province has basically achieved the goal of having a middle school in every township.

From the beginning of spring to June, Anhui Province has newly developed 31,760 civil-run primary schools, enrolling 1,224,096 students. Of the province's 76 municipalities and counties, 46 have basically universalized primary education. In these areas, the school enrollment rate of school-age children has reached over 90%. Currently, regions that have already universalized primary education are actively taking measures to consolidate and improve the newly established schools. In regions that have not yet achieved universal primary education, the mass school establishment movement continues to develop.

To adapt to the needs of production and the requirements for universalizing primary education, various teaching forms have been adopted in different regions, such as full-day, half-day, morning classes, evening classes, noon classes, literacy classes, itinerant primary schools, and crash-course primary schools. The teachers for civil-run primary schools in various regions are mostly recruited locally, employing local junior high and higher primary school graduates.

Since mid-March, the province has established 6,655 various forms of civil-run agricultural middle schools and various vocational middle schools, with an enrollment of 286,217 students. The number of civil-run middle schools is equivalent to 30 times the number of existing public middle schools in the province, and the number of students exceeds the number of students in existing regular middle schools by 133,626. Now, on average, there are 2.6 civil-run agricultural middle schools in each township (镇). The province has basically achieved the goal of having a middle school in every township. Bo County has established more than 170 civil-run middle schools, and 93% of the higher primary school graduates in the townships have been enrolled.

Civil-run agricultural middle schools and various vocational middle schools in various regions are established based on the needs of production and in accordance with local conditions. For example, the Liu'an Special District has established civil-run agricultural middle schools specializing in farming and animal husbandry, horticulture, forestry, water conservancy, fisheries, tea cultivation, and electricity. Xiao County has established agricultural middle schools specializing in grapes, cotton, and rice improvement. Students engage in labor production while studying, based on the principle of not affecting production. Generally, they enroll higher primary school graduates aged 14 to 20.

    安徽乡乡设立民办中学
    半数以上市县普及小学教育
    据安徽日报消息  安徽省普及小学教育和群众办学的运动，正在全省各地蓬勃开展，到目前为止，全省已有半数以上市、县，做到基本普及小学教育，由于民办中学的大量的迅速的发展，全省已基本实现了乡乡有中学。
    安徽省从入春以来到6月份的统计，全省新发展民办小学三万一千七百六十所，招收学生一百二十二万四千零九十六人。全省七十六个市县已有四十六个市县基本上普及了小学教育。这些地区的学龄儿童入学率达到90％以上，目前，已经普及小学教育的地区，正在积极采取措施巩固提高新办的学校。尚未实现普及小学教育的地区，群众办学运动还在继续发展。
    为了适应生产需要和普及小学教育的要求，各地采用了多种多样的教学形式，如全日制，半日制，早班，晚班，午班，识字班，巡回小学和速成小学等。各地民办小学的师资大都是就地取材，聘请当地初中和高小毕业生担任的。
    这个省自3月中旬以来，已经办起各种形式的民办农业中学和各种职业中学六千六百五十五所，入学人数达二十八万六千二百一十七人。民办中学的学校数相当于这个省现有公立中学数目的三十倍，学生比现有普通中学在校学生多十三万三千六百二十六人。现在平均每乡（镇）有民办农业中学二点六所。已经基本上做到了乡乡有中学。亳县办起民办中学一百七十多所，在乡的历届高小毕业生有93％已入学。
    各地民办农业中学和各种职业中学是根据生产需要、因地制宜的原则设立的。如六安专区举办的有农牧、园艺、林业、水利、渔业、茶业、电力等民办农业中学；肖县举办的有葡萄、棉花、稻改等农业中学，学生一面劳动生产，一面读书，以不影响生产为原则，一般的招收十四到二十岁的高小毕业生。
