Xinhua News Agency, July 29th -- The Chiang Kai-shek clique, in order to cooperate with the U.S. imperialist policy of armed aggression against the Middle East and threatening world peace, has intensified its provocative activities in our southeast coastal areas. This morning, it dispatched four U.S.-made Chiang aircraft to intrude into the airspace over Shantou and Nan'ao Island, which were immediately met with a head-on blow by our Air Force aircraft, shooting down or damaging three of them.

At 11:05 AM, four U.S.-made Chiang F-84 jet fighters intruded into the airspace over Shantou City and Nan'ao Island in Guangdong Province. Our aircraft immediately took off to intercept them. At 11:14 AM, our aircraft encountered the Chiang aircraft. After two minutes of fierce fighting, one Chiang aircraft was hit and caught fire, immediately crashing into the sea near Gongkou; another two Chiang aircraft were wounded and fled to Taiwan in a panic, one of which crashed into the sea midway. Among the downed aircraft, one pilot parachuted and landed on the sea 15 kilometers northeast of Nan'ao.

In recent days, Chiang's aircraft have continuously intruded into the airspace over our southeast coastal areas to carry out harassment and sabotage activities. At 10:34 AM on the 28th, two Chiang RF-84 reconnaissance aircraft intruded into the airspace over Putian, Xianyou, Dehua, Liancheng, and Changting in Fujian, conducting reconnaissance and harassment.
