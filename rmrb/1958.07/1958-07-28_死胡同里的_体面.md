    “Dignity” in a Dead End
    Ruan Yanshun
    The American bourgeois columnist Walter Lippmann makes his living by helping the American big bourgeoisie. Whenever the foolish imperialists are in trouble, he comes out to offer them plans. Now he believes that his masters have entered a "dead end" and are in a "dilemma," so he published an article in the New York "Herald Tribune" on July 24 to offer advice to his masters so that the American invading army can "withdraw with dignity" from the dead end.
    Lippmann's so-called "withdrawal with dignity" means that American imperialism should go to the "high-level conference," put forward more blackmailing conditions, and withdraw from Lebanon after gaining something.
    He deeply sympathizes with the plight of his masters. He said to them: The upcoming "high-level conference" is indeed like "a nightmare," "a very terrible thing," "In this nightmare, people feel a kind of oppression, forcing them to do things they are very unwilling to do." However, he advised those arrogant and foolish war-mongers (in Lippmann's words, those who believe that only "the restoration of Iraq and the elimination of Nasser" are acceptable) to be calm. Because "Mr. Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles are now between the devil and the deep blue sea," "agreeing to hold a meeting is dangerous now, and refusing to hold a meeting is also dangerous." He believes that "they are trying to do now what Eden and Mollet tried to do in the Suez incident about two years ago." He said to them, "There is some truth in this view. But those who hold this view are born in the wrong era." Because first, "the Soviet Union is now a power that is incomparably stronger than Tsarist Russia in the nineteenth century." Second, "the Arab revolution... simply did not exist in the imperial era of the last century." Thirdly, he believes that some countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will not wholeheartedly support the American aggression. He said, "Once there is a military showdown due to an Arab country in the Middle East, it cannot be expected that those democratic countries will always follow along." And he pointed out, "The fact is that the president has already... reluctantly accepted the proposal to hold a summit meeting to discuss the Middle East issue under the pressure of widespread public opinion in various parts of the (world)." He sees this as an "unfortunate" event.
    Why is it so "unfortunate"? It is because the United States and Britain acted too hastily and rashly in the invasion of the Middle East. "The United States and Britain intervened in Lebanon and Jordan to prevent their collapse (Lippmann discounted this here; in fact, the purpose of the United States' intervention in the Middle East was even more to make "the restoration of Iraq and the elimination of Nasser"). But this was a hasty reaction after unexpected news came from Iraq, and it was not a well-thought-out policy action." In this way, this group of crazy war criminals broke into the "dead end" that Lippmann said. Now, the American invading army is trapped in the quagmire, unable to advance or retreat, and is subject to the angry opposition of the people of the world. This is truly self-inflicted. On this point, Lippmann is right:
  "Unless the Lebanese issue is resolved considerably and the Marines are withdrawn, their long-term presence in Lebanon will make us embarrassed everywhere in the world." He persuaded his masters: Refusing to negotiate is not a correct and effective method. The correct and effective method is to put forward "conditions" at the meeting in order to obtain what cannot be obtained by military force. Therefore, he believes that "it is in the very great interest of the United States, and it can be said without exaggeration that it is of vital interest, to enable this batch of Marines to withdraw with dignity through negotiations."
    Lippmann is very worried that "this may not be possible." First, he does feel that this invasion has made the United States too isolated politically and strategically to be able to put forward any reason for "withdrawing with dignity." He believes that if a meeting is really held, "we will fail, because it is always easier to condemn intervention than to defend intervention." Therefore, "we cannot put forward any conditions that can be negotiated and resolved." Second, he is worried that the revolutionary will of the Arabs in the Middle East is too firm, and the attitude of the people of the world against aggression is too firm, and they will not agree to them obtaining what they cannot obtain by war. In Lippmann's words, this is "given the revolutionary nature of the Nasser movement, this may not be possible." He sees this as an even greater misfortune for the American invaders.
    However, Lippmann still has a fluke illusion. He said: "However, given the military weakness of the Arab countries on the one hand, and the great need for the West in terms of oil trade and economic development on the other hand, this may not be impossible if a serious and thorough effort is made."
    Lippmann's remarks are also of great significance to the people of the world who oppose imperialist aggression. First, although his purpose is to make plans for the American aggressors, what he pointed out about the isolated situation of the American aggressors, the political and military fragility of the American paper tiger, their helplessness in front of the anti-aggression people, and their entry into a dead end, are still true; second, it exposes the American aggressors' conspiracy to carry out blackmail at the high-level conference, and this conspiracy is intended to be built on the "military weakness" and "economic poverty" of the "Arab countries." That is to say, he still wants to use the fear of America to blackmail some people, and at the same time, he also wants to buy off some other people.
    As long as we see through the conspiracy of the American aggressors, and are not moved by intimidation and enticement, and carry out persistent struggle, American imperialism will never be able to obtain the conditions for "withdrawing with dignity" from the Arab people, and the result will only be "losing face and preserving life." People trapped in a dead end will never get and should never get "dignity." Dr. Soper of England pointed out many days before Lippmann that "it is better to lose face and save life than to save face and lose life." If the enemy does not withdraw, resolutely eliminate it, and nothing else should be given to them.

### 死胡同里的“体面”

    死胡同里的“体面”
    阮延顺
    美国的资产阶级专栏作者李普曼，是靠替美国大资产阶级帮闲吃饭的。每当愚蠢的帝国主义者陷入灾难的时候，他便要出来为它献计划策。现在他又认为自己的主子已经走进了“死胡同”，处在了“进退两难”的境地，所以他在7月24日的纽约“先驱论坛报”上发表文章向主子献策，以便使美国侵略军能够从死胡同里“体面地退出”。
    李普曼的所谓“体面地退出”，就是要美帝国主义去到“高级会议”上，多提一些要挟的条件，在捞得一些东西以后，再从黎巴嫩退出来。
    他十分同情他的主子的苦衷。向他们说：将要举行的“高级会议”的确像是“一场恶梦”，“是一个非常可怕的事情”，“在这场恶梦里，人们感到一种压迫，迫使他们去作他们非常不愿去作的事情。”但是，他劝告那些狂妄而又愚蠢的战争贩子（用李普曼的话说，这些人认为只有“伊拉克复辟和消灭纳赛尔”的办法才能接受。）要冷静些。因为“艾森豪威尔先生和杜勒斯先生现在处在恶魔和大海之间”，“同意举行会议现在来说是危险的，而拒绝举行会议也是危险的”。他认为“他们是想在现在办到艾登和摩勒两年左右以前在苏伊士事件中想办到的事情。”他对他们说“这种看法中有一点道理。但是持有这种看法的人生错了时代。”因为第一，“苏联现在是一个比十九世纪的沙俄强大得无法比较的大国”。第二，“阿拉伯的革命……在上一世纪的帝国时代是根本不存在的。”还有第三，他认为北大西洋公约组织中的一些国家，并不会死心塌地地支持美国的侵略。他说“一旦由于中东的一个阿拉伯国家而在军事上摊牌，不能指望那些民主国家一直跟着走。”而且他指出，“事实是：总统已经在……（世界）各地的广泛的舆论的前推后拥之下，勉强接受举行最高级会议讨论中东问题的主张”。他把这看作是一种“不幸”。
    为什么会这样“不幸”呢？是因为美国和英国，在侵略中东事件上作得太仓促，太冒失。“美英两国所以干涉黎巴嫩和约旦是为了防止它们的崩溃（李普曼在这里打了折扣，其实，美国干涉中东的目的，更是为了使“伊拉克复辟和消灭纳赛尔”）。但是这是伊拉克传来出乎意料的消息以后匆匆忙忙作出的反应，并不是深思熟虑的政策行动。”这样，这群疯狂的战争罪犯就闯进了李普曼所说的“死胡同”里。到如今，美国侵略军陷入泥坑，进退维谷，遭受到全世界人民的愤怒的反对。这真是自作自受。在这一点上，李普曼倒说对了：
  “除非相当地解决黎巴嫩问题，撤出海军陆战队，否则，他们在黎巴嫩的长期驻扎将使我们在全世界到处难堪。”他劝说他的主子们：拒绝会谈不是一个正确和有效的办法。而正确和有效的办法是到会议上去大提“条件”，借以取得用军队取不到的东西。因此他认为，“通过谈判使这批海军陆战队能够体面地退出，这对美国有非常大的利害关系的，也可以毫不夸大地说具有切身利害的关系。”
    李普曼非常担心，“这也许是办不到的”。第一，他的确感到这次的侵略行动使得美国在政治上和战略上太孤立，以致根本提不出什么“体面地退出”的理由来。他认为如果真正开起会来，“我们将失败，因为谴责干涉总是比为干涉辩护要容易。”因此，“我们提不出什么可以谈判解决的条件来。”第二，他担心中东的阿拉伯人革命意志太坚决，世界人民反对侵略的态度太坚决，不会答应他们取得他们用战争取不到手的东西。用李普曼的话说，这就是“鉴于纳赛尔运动的革命性质、这也许是办不到的”。他把这看作是美国侵略者更大的不幸。
    然而，李普曼是还有着侥幸的幻想的。他说：“但是，鉴于阿拉伯国家一方面在军事上脆弱，另方面在石油贸易和经济发展上又非常需要西方，如果进行认真和彻底的努力的话，这也许并不是办不到的事情。”
    李普曼的这番话，对于反对帝国主义侵略的世界人民也很有意义。第一，尽管他的目的是在替美国侵略者划策。但他所指出的美国侵略者的孤立处境，美国纸老虎在政治和军事上的脆弱，他们在反侵略人民面前的无可奈何，他们走进了死胡同，这些仍还是真实的；第二，它暴露了美国侵略者企图在高级会议上进行讹诈的阴谋，而这个阴谋是想建立在“阿拉伯国家军事力量的脆弱”和“经济贫困”上的。也就是说，他还想利用一部分人的恐美心理来进行讹诈，同时也还想对另一部分人进行一些收买。
    只要识破美国侵略者的阴谋，毫不为恐吓和利诱所动，进行坚持不挠的斗争，美帝国主义就决不能从阿拉伯人民手里取得“体面地退出”的条件，而结果只好落得“失掉面子保全生命”的。陷在死胡同里的人是永远得不到也永远不应该得到“体面”的。英国的索佩尔博士早在李普曼之前许多天就指出了“失掉面子而保全生命，要比保全面子而失掉生命好得多。”敌人倘不退出，就坚决消灭它，此外再不应该给他们什么别的东西。
