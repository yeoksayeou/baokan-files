Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 19th: The North China region, which used to have the lowest grain yield, will rapidly move to the forefront of the country in grain production. Due to the great leap forward in agriculture, this region will not only be self-sufficient in grain this year, but also have a large reserve. This is the conclusion reached at the North China Six Provinces and Cities Agricultural Collaboration Conference recently held in Zhengzhou, after carefully studying the current situation of the great leap forward in agriculture.

The conference was presided over by Comrade Tan Zhenlin, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Secretariat. The conference was attended by the secretaries of the provincial committees and relevant responsible persons from the five provinces and one city of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, and Beijing. The conference lasted eight days and ended on the 14th. Finally, Comrade Tan Zhenlin made a concluding speech at the meeting.

According to the reports from the provinces and cities, the six provinces and cities harvested a total of 243 million mu of summer grain crops this year, with a total output of 49.6 billion jin, an increase of 88% over last year, which is equivalent to more than the total grain increase in the country in 1956 and 1957 combined. The unprecedented bumper summer harvest has become a material force for promoting the emancipation of people's minds. The soaring enthusiasm, coupled with the rich experience accumulated by various places since last winter in implementing the basic measures of water conservancy, fertilizer, seeds, close planting, prevention and eradication of crop diseases and insect pests, strengthening field management, and tool reform, means that the wave of the great leap forward in agriculture next year will inevitably be greater and higher than this year.

The meeting pointed out that to achieve a comprehensive bumper autumn harvest, it is necessary to continue fighting hard for three months; to ensure a bumper harvest next year, it is necessary to continue fighting hard this winter and next spring; to realize the wish of the people in the whole region to have adequate food and clothing, it is necessary to fight hard for three to five years. Therefore, there must be absolutely no complacency or satisfaction at present. Currently, in addition to doing a good job in flood control and autumn field management, special attention should be paid to grasping tool reform, which is the basic way to solve the problem of labor shortage. This is not only a technical measure, but also a political one. Party committees at all levels must pay close attention to it. Efforts should be made to universally use improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools to replace backward farm tools and increase labor efficiency by more than two times this year.

The meeting also proposed that active preparations should be made from now on for a greater leap forward next year. In addition to grasping the preparations for water conservancy, fertilizer, and seeds, a large-scale movement of deep plowing and soil improvement should be universally carried out, requiring a general deep plowing of all arable land in the autumn and winter/spring.

The meeting focused on discussing the policies and measures to be taken in the situation of the great leap forward in agriculture. The meeting believed that with the high tide of agricultural production and the movement of socialist construction in rural areas, a team of socialist construction activists who are both red and expert has emerged in the countryside. They not only play a backbone role in ensuring the construction of socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, but also play a backbone role in guiding farmers from simple physical labor to the communist road of combining physical and mental labor. Therefore, party committees at all levels must earnestly strengthen the leadership of this team and continuously develop and strengthen it.

The meeting emphasized that political and ideological work is the soul of the high tide of production. "Politics takes command before the army moves," and all work must put politics in command. In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, discovering contradictions and resolving contradictions; constantly encouraging the advanced and overcoming the backward; and constantly improving the socialist consciousness and communist style of cadres and the masses and struggling against capitalist ideas are the main tasks of political and ideological work in the situation of the great leap forward in agriculture.

The meeting also discussed in detail the new changes in rural areas caused by the great agricultural harvest - a more advanced form of communal nature has appeared in some places, although these are not yet large-scale today, we must foresee this point and start investigating, researching, and preparing as soon as possible.

The meeting also discussed how to strengthen the education and management of a very small number of individual farmers in the situation of the great leap forward in agriculture, as well as the socialist education movement in rural areas this winter and next spring, and the consumption and accumulation of agricultural cooperatives. The meeting also conducted a detailed study of issues such as soil and water conservation and the standards of water conservancy.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 19th: The Southern Rice Production Promotion Conference, which lasted nine days, closed in Chengdu on the 16th. Developing rice production at a higher speed was the central topic of the conference.

At the meeting, the heads of agricultural departments, scientific and technical personnel, and representatives of high-yield areas from twelve provinces and autonomous regions in the south believed that the Party's general line for socialist construction is the driving force of the great historical period, which has mobilized the immeasurable subjective initiative of hundreds of millions of people. Even low-yielding wheat can release "satellites" with yields of more than 7,000 jin per mu and increase unit yield by 68%, which foretells people that rice, which enjoys a high reputation for high yield and has always had a higher yield per unit area than wheat, can leap forward at a higher speed.

According to preliminary statistics based on the actual harvest and yield measurement reported by the twelve provinces, the average yield per mu of early rice, which accounts for 28% of the country's summer harvest crops, will increase from 323 jin last year to 490 jin, an increase of more than 52%. As long as we grasp the eight key factors for increasing production—deep plowing, early sowing, close planting, increasing fertilizer application, selecting good varieties, pest control, disaster prevention, and strengthening field management—during the current three-month critical period, we are confident that we can achieve the task of increasing the production of middle and late rice.

Therefore, the meeting focused on summarizing the many new experiences of various places in using these eight links in the past six months. Many representatives introduced the practices of fully using these experiences at the meeting.

The meeting believed that putting politics in command and further strengthening the leadership method of the mass line are the fundamental guarantees for realizing various production increase measures. The meeting also discussed and studied how to organize the production leap forward next year in accordance with the spirit of "the previous season is for the next season, this year is for next year."

    继续苦战三月实现秋季全面大丰收
    华北区粮食今年有大量储备
    南方水稻会议总结出水稻增产的八项有效措施
    据新华社郑州19日电　过去粮食产量最低的华北地区，粮食生产将迅速走向全国的前列。由于农业大跃进，今年这个地区的粮食不仅可以自给，并且还能有大量的储备。这是最近在郑州举行的华北六省、市农业协作会议上，在认真研究了当前农业大跃进的形势以后，得出的结论。
    这次会议由中共中央政治局委员、书记处书记谭震林同志主持召开的。参加会议的有山西、河北、山东、河南、陕西和北京五省、一市的省委书记和有关方面的负责人。会议历时八天，在14日结束。最后由谭震林同志在会议上作了总结性发言。
    各省、市汇报，六省、市今年夏收粮食作物共二万四千三百万亩，总产量达四百九十六亿斤，比去年增产88％，等于1956、1957两年全国粮食增产的总和还要多。夏季空前大丰收，已成为推动人们解放思想的物质力量。冲天的干劲，加上自去冬以来各地在贯彻执行水利、肥料、种籽、密植、防治和根除作物病虫害、加强田间管理与工具改革等基本措施中积累的丰富经验，明年农业大跃进的浪潮将必然要比今年更大、更高。
    会议指出：要实现秋季全面大丰收，还要经过三个月的苦战；要保证明年的大丰收，还要经过今冬明春的苦战；实现全区人民丰衣足食的愿望，那就要苦战三、五年。因此，现在绝对不能有任何的麻痹自满。当前，除了做好防汛和秋田管理外，要特别注意抓紧工具改革，这是目前解决劳动力不足问题的基本道路。这不仅是一项技术性措施，而且是一项政治性的措施。各级党委必须引起高度重视。力争在今年内，普遍使用改良农具和半机械化农具，来代替落后农具，提高劳动效率两倍以上。
    会议还提出：必须要从现在起就要积极为明年的更大跃进进行准备。现在除抓紧水利、肥料、种籽等项准备之外，还要普遍开展一个大规模的深翻土地、改良土壤的运动，要求在大干一秋，加一个冬、春，把全部耕地都普遍深翻一遍。
    会议着重讨论了在农业大跃进的形势下，应采取的政策措施。会议认为，随着农业生产高潮和农村社会主义建设运动，农村中已经出现了一支又红又专的社会主义建设积极分子的队伍。他们不仅在保证多、快、好、省建设社会主义上起着骨干作用，而且在引导农民从单纯的体力劳动，走上体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的共产主义道路，也将起着骨干作用。因此各级党委必须认真加强对于这支队伍的领导，使之不断发展壮大。
    会议强调指出，政治思想工作是生产高潮的灵魂。“兵马未动，政治先行”，所有工作必须政治挂帅。按照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，发现矛盾，解决矛盾；不断的鼓励先进，克服落后；不断提高干部和群众的社会主义觉悟和共产主义风格，和资本主义思想进行斗争，是在农业大跃进形势下政治思想工作的主要任务。
    会议还详细讨论了由于农业大丰收，引起农村新变革——个别地方已出现了一种比较高级的公社性的形式，这些在今天虽然还不是大量的，但我们必须预见到这点，及早着手调查研究和准备。
    会议还讨论了在农业大跃进形势下，如何加强对极少数单干农民的教育和管理问题，以及今冬明春农村的社会主义教育运动和农业社的消费和积累等问题。会议对于水土保持和水利化的标准等问题，也都进行了详细的研究。
    据新华社成都19日电　南方水稻增产促进会议历时九天，16日在成都闭幕。以更高的速度发展水稻生产，是这次会议的中心议题。
    会上，南方十二个省、自治区农业部门负责人、科学技术人员、丰产区代表认为，党的社会主义建设总路线是伟大历史时期的动力，调动了亿万人民不可估量的主观能动作用。一向低产的小麦尚能放出亩产七千多斤的“卫星”，并使单位产量增加68％，这就预告人们，享有高产盛誉、单产历来高过小麦的水稻，能以更高的速度向前跃进。
    根据十二省汇报的实收和测产情况初步统计，面积占全国夏收作物28％的早稻，平均亩产量将由去年的三百二十三斤增加到四百九十斤，提高52％以上。只要在当前三个月的关键时期，抓住深耕、早播、密植、增施肥料、选用良种、除虫、防灾、加强田间管理这八个增产的关键，实现中晚稻的增产任务也是有把握的。
    因此，会议着重地总结了近半年来各地运用这八个环节的许多新经验。不少代表在会上介绍了充分运用这些经验的做法。
    会议认为，政治挂帅，进一步加强群众路线的领导方法，是实现各项增产措施的根本保证。会议还按照“上季为下季、今年为明年”的精神，讨论研究了如何组织明年生产跃进的问题。
