Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, July 27th: Veteran American conspirator Murphy is intensifying his behind-the-scenes political activities, attempting to coerce the Lebanese opposition into participating in the parliamentary session scheduled for July 31st to elect a new president.

On the 26th, Murphy met with Chamoun again. According to Murphy on the same day, he had attempted to hold talks with various people, especially Muslim and Christian leaders. He also expects to hold talks with opposition leader Salam in the coming days.

Reportedly, discussions are currently centered around several presidential candidates: Nakash, who served as president from 1941 to 1943; former President Huli; and Army Commander-in-Chief Shehab. "Al-Shark" believes that supporters of the government favor Nakash as a candidate.

Beirut newspapers point out that the main factor creating difficulties for this election is the U.S. military occupation of Lebanon.

"Al-Shark" pointed out that opposition leader and leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, Jumblatt, said: "Our crisis was originally being resolved by our own internal forces, but the American aggression has made everything problematic. The Lebanese problem should be solved by the Lebanese themselves. If the Americans do not withdraw from Lebanon on their own, we will drive them out."

According to the newspaper, another opposition leader, Salam, emphasized that "the opposition does not agree to hold presidential elections because such elections will be conducted under the threat of foreign troops."

According to the Indian Press Trust, Murphy has also held a series of meetings with members of the United Nations Observation Group to discuss expanding the UN observation mission. The news says that the number of observers is expected to increase to one thousand soon.

    黎巴嫩反对派领袖表示
    不在美军威胁下选举总统
    美国阴谋家墨菲仍在幕后布设骗局
    新华社27日讯　贝鲁特消息：老牌美国阴谋家墨菲正在加紧进行幕后的政治活动，企图诱迫黎巴嫩反对派参加预定在7月31日举行的选举新总统的议会会议。
    26日，墨菲又同夏蒙会谈。据墨菲在当天说，他曾经试图和各种各样的人举行会谈，特别是穆斯林和基督教领袖们会谈。他还期望在今后几天内同反对派领袖萨拉姆举行会谈。
    据报道，这几天正在围绕这样几个总统候选人进行会谈：一个是曾在1941年到1943年担任总统的纳卡希，一个是前总统扈利，另一个是陆军总司令谢哈布。“东方报”认为，支持政府的人赞成纳卡希为候选人。
    据贝鲁特报纸指出，给这次选举造成困难的主要因素是美国军队侵占黎巴嫩。
    “东方报”指出，反对派领袖之一、社会进步党领袖琼卜拉特说：“我们的危机本来正在以自己内部力量解决，但由于美国的侵犯使一切都成问题了。黎巴嫩的问题应当由黎巴嫩人自己解决。如果美国人不自行撤出黎巴嫩，我们将赶走他们”。
    据这家报纸说，另一个反对派领袖萨拉姆强调指出，“反对派不同意进行总统选举，因为这种选举将在外国军队的威胁下进行”。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，墨菲还同联合国观察团的人员举行了一系列的会议，讨论关于扩大联合国观察团的问题。消息说，观察团的人数不久可望增加到一千人。
