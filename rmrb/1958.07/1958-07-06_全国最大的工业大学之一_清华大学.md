One of the Largest Industrial Universities in the Country—Tsinghua University

Tsinghua University is one of the largest multi-disciplinary industrial universities in the country, with more than 10,000 undergraduate and various training course students. The university has eleven departments and more than thirty specialties, of which nearly twenty are basic specialties essential for heavy industrial construction, and more than a dozen are cutting-edge science and technology.

Among the earlier established departments, the Department of Mechanical Engineering is currently the largest department in the university, including various specialties in mechanical manufacturing, cultivating specialized talents in casting, pressure processing, welding, mechanical manufacturing, precision machinery, and metallographic heat treatment. Students in various specialties of the Department of Power Machinery will study the design and manufacturing technologies of thermal power plants, automobiles and tractors, gas turbines, and steam turbines. The Department of Electrical Engineering is one of the oldest departments in Tsinghua University, and its four specialties all serve the national electrification cause, cultivating engineers in electrical machinery, appliances, power plant transmission and distribution, and high voltage. The Department of Hydraulic Engineering directly serves water conservancy and hydropower generation, cultivating specialized talents in surveying, designing, and constructing hydraulic structures such as reservoirs, dams, weirs, and embankments, as well as hydropower stations. The tasks of students in various specialties of the Department of Civil Engineering and the Department of Architecture are to design and construct industrial buildings such as factories, civil buildings, urban planning, and water supply, gas, and heating engineering required by modern industry and cities. All these specialized cadres are important technical forces in building a strong socialist industrial country.

Before the National Science Plan of 1956, a batch of the latest cutting-edge science and technology specialties were established at Tsinghua University, and the Departments of Engineering Physics, Engineering Physical Chemistry, Engineering Mechanics and Mathematics, Automatic Control, and Radio Electronics were successively established. The three departments of Engineering Physics, Engineering Physical Chemistry, and Engineering Mechanics and Mathematics bear the glorious task of training cadres for the peaceful utilization of atomic energy. The Department of Automatic Control has specialties such as automatic control, remote control, and electronic computers. Radio Electronics has specialties such as radio technology and physics, electronic devices and physics, and semiconductors. These new technologies have broad applications in the national economy, defense, and scientific research, such as fully automated factories, the automation of atomic energy production processes, and the automatic aiming of anti-aircraft guns and searchlights, which are inseparable from them. This batch of new cutting-edge science and technology specialties has been established in Tsinghua for several years. Because they have made full use of the original foundation of related departments in Tsinghua University and the experience of teaching reform in the past few years, they have grown particularly rapidly. Some specialties have already had their first graduates, and some young teachers have for the first time in China produced multi-channel communication equipment for artificial satellites to transmit signals, non-linear electronic analog computers and other new products.

On this basis, a new upsurge of work-study programs has been set off throughout the university. Teachers, students, and staff work hard day and night. After midnight, Tsinghua Garden is brightly lit, and the sound of iron plates being struck and machines roaring rises and falls. The once deserted laboratories and practice factories have become bustling production bases. Under the leadership of the Party, teachers, students, and workers cooperate closely, go all out, and give full play to the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and have produced more than 200 kinds of products in four months. Among them, more than 60 items have reached the advanced level in China, and some have caught up with or surpassed the advanced level in the world.

In the Great Leap Forward, the slogans of "Launch a new education revolution!" and "Build a new communist Tsinghua!" are now inspiring the teachers, students, and staff of Tsinghua University. Everyone is striving to become a worker with communist consciousness, communist style, and culture, learning and working at the same time, organically combining the two, and moving towards the goal of being "both red and expert!"

    全国最大的工业大学之一——清华大学
    清华大学是全国最大的多科性工业大学之一，现有本科和各种进修班的学生一万余人。全校设有十一个系三十多个专业，其中接近二十个专业是重工业建设所必须的基本专业，十几个专业是尖端科学技术。
    在设立较早的一些系中，机械制造系是目前全校最大的系，包括机械制造的各专业，培养着铸工、压力加工、焊接、机械制造、精密机械及金属学热处理等专门人才。动力机械系各专业的学生，将学习热力发电厂、汽车拖拉机、燃气轮机及汽轮机的设计和制造技术。电机系是清华大学最老的系之一，它的四个专业都是为全国电气化事业服务的，培养电机、电器、发电厂输配电和高压的工程师。水利系是直接为水利化和水力发电服务的，培养勘察、设计和修建水库、闸、坝、堤等水工建筑物和水电站的专门人才。土木系和建筑系各专业学生的任务，则是设计和建造厂房等工业建筑、民用建筑、城市规划以及近代工业和城市所需要的供水、燃气和暖气工程。所有这些专业干部，都是建设社会主义工业强国中的重要技术力量。
    1956年全国科学规划以前，在清华大学设立了一批最新的尖端科学技术方面的专业，陆续成立了工程物理、工程物理化学、工程力学数学、自动控制、无线电电子学等系。工程物理、工程物理化学、工程力学数学三个系担负着培养和平利用原子能干部的光荣任务。自动控制系有自动控制远程控制、电子计算机等专业，无线电电子学有无线电技术和物理、电子器件和物理、半导体等专业，这些方面的新技术在国民经济、国防事业和科学研究上有着广泛的运用，如完全自动化的工厂、原子能生产过程的自动化、高射炮和探照灯的自动瞄准等，就离不开它们。这一批新的尖端科学技术方面的专业，在清华已经建立了几年，由于它们充分利用了清华大学相近系的原有基础和前几年教学改革的经验，成长特别迅速。有的专业已有了第一批毕业生，有些青年教师已在国内第一次制出可供人造卫星传递讯号的多路通讯设备，非线性电子模拟计算机等新产品。
    在这个基础上，全校掀起了勤工俭学的新高潮。师生员工夜以继日地“苦战”，半夜过后，清华园内灯火通明，铁板敲击声、机器轰鸣声此起彼应。往日冷冷清清的实验室、实习工厂，已变成了轰轰烈烈的生产基地。在党的领导下，师生工人密切合作，鼓足干劲，发挥了敢想敢干的精神，四个月制成了二百多种产品。其中有六十多项达到了国内先进水平，还有一部分赶上或超过了世界先进水平。
    在大跃进中，“掀起新的教育革命！”“建设共产主义新清华！”的口号，现在正鼓舞着清华大学的师生员工，人人争着成为有共产主义觉悟、有共产主义风格、有文化的劳动者，一边学习、一边劳动，使两者有机地结合起来，向着“又红又专”的目标迈进！（附图片）
