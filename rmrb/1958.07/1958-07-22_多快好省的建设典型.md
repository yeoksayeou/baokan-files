A typical example of construction: More, Faster, Better, and More Economical
	Cheng Pu

Following the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the Huairou Reservoir was completed with astonishing speed. This is another communist flower in water conservancy construction. From now on, there will be a pair of beautiful sister reservoirs near the capital, adding new color to the rivers and mountains and delivering new blood to the farmland. The people of the capital and the people of the whole country are rejoicing at the birth of this pair of sister reservoirs.

This pair of reservoirs are both products of the Great Leap Forward and the crystallization of the communist spirit. If the Ming Tombs Reservoir was mainly built by the voluntary labor of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, farmers in the suburbs of the capital, and employees of enterprises and institutions, then the Huairou Reservoir was built almost entirely by the voluntary labor of farmers themselves. The 60,000 farmers who participated in the construction of the Huairou Reservoir came from more than 3,400 agricultural cooperatives in twelve counties and districts. They brought their own tools and sheds, their own rations and cooking utensils. Not only did the farmers in the directly and indirectly benefited areas come, but also the farmers in the non-benefited areas traveled hundreds of miles to come here. In this communist cooperation, no one would regret doing their best without enjoying the rights, and no one would haggle over "you take advantage and I suffer." People's horizons have been infinitely broadened. Here, selfish interests were abandoned, and the small interests of small areas and small scopes were also put aside; what people pursued was the great benefit of vast areas and vast people. Zhang He, a poor peasant in Sanhe County, disassembled his beloved bicycle and converted it into a soil-transporting vehicle. When he arrived at the construction site, he joined the Huang Jiguang Commando Team, breaking the soil-transporting quota by more than four times and being named a model worker six times. There are more than thousands of heroes like this on the construction site. With such a communist spirit, what else can't be done? As long as we widely promote such a communist spirit, we will surely be invincible in the great struggle to build socialism!

The Huairou Reservoir controls a larger drainage area, water storage capacity, and irrigation area than the Ming Tombs Reservoir. In the past, it was unimaginable for the masses to build such a large reservoir on their own, and it would not be easy for the state to build it. However, in this era of rising communist thought, it was built in 130 days and nights with the method of public-private partnership, mainly by the people, and the state only subsidized 3.5 million yuan. This is a brilliant example of more, faster, better, and more economical construction. This fact vividly illustrates that the construction capabilities of the peasant masses are rapidly growing, and the superiority of the agricultural cooperative system is rapidly increasing! The idea that farmers can only build small-scale water conservancy projects is outdated. Today, the peasant masses are fully capable of building large-scale water conservancy projects, and can do it in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical.

The birth of the Huairou Reservoir is showing a new development trend for water conservancy construction this winter and next spring: not only will small-scale water conservancy projects bloom everywhere, but also medium-sized and large-scale water conservancy projects will emerge in large numbers on the basis of being mainly run by the people. There is not only quantitative development here, but also qualitative improvement. Let us welcome this new situation in water conservancy construction with full confidence!

    多快好省的建设典型
    程浦
    继十三陵水库之后，怀柔水库又以惊人的速度建成了。这是水利建设上的又一枝共产主义的花朵。从此，首都附近有了一对美丽的姊妹水库，它们正在为河山增添新的姿色，为农田输送新的血液。首都人民和全国人民都在为这一对姊妹水库的诞生而欢喜。
    这一对水库同是大跃进时期的产物，同是共产主义精神的结晶。如果说十三陵水库主要是靠解放军官兵、首都郊区农民和企业的职工及机关工作人员的义务劳动建成的，那么怀柔水库则几乎全是靠农民自己的义务劳动建成的。参加怀柔水库建设的六万农民，来自十二个县区的三千四百多个农业合作社。他们自带工具和工棚，自带口粮和炊事用具。不仅直接受益和间接受益地区的农民来了，非受益地区的农民也跋涉数百里来到这里。在这种共产主义大协作中，谁也不会因为自己的干尽义务、不享权利而感到遗憾，谁也不去斤斤计较“你占便宜我吃亏”的事。人们的眼光无限地放大了。在这里，一己的私利被抛弃了，狭小地区、狭小范围的小利，也被搁在了一边；人们所追求的是广大地区广大人民的大利。三河县一个贫农张贺，把自己心爱的自行车拆卸了，改装成运土车，来到工地他就加入了黄继光突击队，突破运土定额四倍多，六次被评为民工模范。工地上像这样的英雄人物何止千百。有了这样的共产主义精神，还有什么事情做不成？只要把这样的共产主义精神广泛地发扬起来，我们在建设社会主义的伟大斗争中，就一定会无往而不胜！
    怀柔水库控制流域面积、蓄水量、灌溉面积都比十三陵水库大。这样的大水库，在过去，不要说群众自建是人们不敢想像的，就是国家来建也是很不容易的。可是，在这共产主义思想高涨的时代，却用民办公助，以民办为主的办法，用一百三十个昼夜就建成了，国家只补助了三百五十万元。这是建设上的多快好省的光辉典型。这个事实生动地说明了：农民群众的建设能力在迅速壮大，农业合作制度的优越性在迅速增长！那种认为农民只能建设小型水利工程的观念，已经过时了。今天，农民群众完全能建设大水利工程，而且能做到多快好省。
    怀柔水库的诞生正在为今冬明春的水利建设昭示出一种新的发展趋势：不但小型水利工程将遍地开花，中型的和大型的水利工程也将在民办为主的基础上大量地涌现。这里不但有量的发展，而且有质的提高。让我们满怀信心地迎接这个水利建设的新形势！
