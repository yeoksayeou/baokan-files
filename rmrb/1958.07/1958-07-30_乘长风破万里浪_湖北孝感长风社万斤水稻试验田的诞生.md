Riding the Wind and Breaking the Waves
    ——The Birth of the 10,000-Jin Rice Experimental Field in Changfeng Commune, Xiaogan, Hubei
    By Our Correspondent Fang Ji

    This year’s high wheat yield greatly stimulated people's imagination, especially for those on the agricultural front. Guan Musheng, the director of the Changfeng Commune in Xiaogan, Hubei, is a national model agricultural laborer who first achieved a thousand-jin rice yield. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the prevailing spirit of going all out, aiming high, he thought, "What shall I do for the Leap Forward? In the past, rice yielded at most three hundred jin, but now it yields three thousand, a nine-fold increase; how about achieving a per-mu yield of ten thousand jin?"

    He thought about it, but didn't dare to speak up. He felt that if he failed, what kind of model would he be! He decided to conduct an experiment, but only on five fen of land. He dug two chi deep and applied a lot of fertilizer. People looked at him strangely and asked, "Director Guan, are you experimenting? How much?"

    At first, he was reluctant to say, because he remembered that when he was working on the thousand-jin rice, many people made strange remarks about him. At that time, some people even made up a song for him: "Through the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, no one has ever seen rice yielding a thousand jin; our commune has a 'blowing' director who wants to harvest eleven hundred jin." Now, if he tried for ten thousand jin and failed, he would become even more of a "blowing" director. As more and more people asked him, he had no choice but to put up a sign:

    "Guan Musheng Rice Experimental Field, five fen, yield of 10,060 jin per mu."

    This startled people. Everyone came to see this sign—a small sign, but not simple. No one dared to speak up.

    There were complex reasons why people didn’t speak up. Those who had made strange remarks didn’t dare anymore, because it was the Great Leap Forward! To respond with a yield of ten thousand jin wasn't easy; they needed to consider it.

    Unexpectedly, one morning, a sign was also put up next to Director Guan's field, with the number 10,100 jin, 40 jin more. Challenging him were eight rice-growing girls, led by Zhao Cuiyun and Yu Xiaoying. The sign also had four lines of poetry:

    The sound of ten thousand jin per mu is like thunder,
    Lightning flashes, so astonishing!
    Sisters, let's give it our all,
    And surely surpass Director Guan.

    The two signs stood face to face, and the two fields were side by side. This caused a sensation in the entire commune. Young people, women, old people, and even children came to work on the ten-thousand-jin fields and compete with Director Guan.

    This gave old Guan confidence. He didn't expect that five fen of land could mobilize the masses.

    Let's leave the others aside for now and just talk about the story of a group of children.

    In the Sixth Production Team of the Changfeng Commune, there was a child named Hu Chunlin, twelve years old. After the commune started working on ten-thousand-jin rice, he felt that life was a bit different; he couldn't find anyone to play with him because everyone in the commune was in the fields day and night. So he found nine children and discussed it with them, and they went to the production team leader to ask for land to grow ten-thousand-jin rice. The team leader's thinking was not yet completely liberated at that time, and he looked down on the children a bit. He said, "You're not even as tall as the rice stalks, what ten-thousand-jin rice are you going to grow!" These words annoyed the children, who said, "What adults can do, children can also do; adults grow big fields, and children grow small fields!" They left in a huff. They were not discouraged or intimidated, but their determination grew even stronger, and they were determined to do it.

    So they searched everywhere for land. All the land was planted, even the small patches of wasteland by the roadside and fields—where would there be idle land in the countryside now? Unable to think of a solution, they decided to dig up old graves. They were afraid of being scolded by adults during the day, and all the tools were occupied, so they couldn't get them, so they had to dig at night.

    The first night, they dug until midnight, and one fen of land was only dug five cun deep. They couldn't dig the next day because it was an old, barren grave, and the ground was really hard because of the drought. At the same time, they were discovered by adults, who scolded them for "digging up even their ancestors for the sake of ten-thousand-jin rice!" They were forcibly pulled back from the fields.

    On the third night, they got up a little later and carried one hundred and twenty buckets of water to soak the dry and hard old barren graves. This made the digging easier, and they dug until it was one and a half chi deep before stopping.

    The commune learned about their actions. Director Guan and the District Party Secretary took out three mao and bought candy to invite them to a meeting. They each got two pieces of candy, and the District Party Secretary joked, "One piece of candy is worth five thousand jin, and two pieces of candy mean you have to harvest ten thousand jin, okay?"

    The children were very surprised and laughed together happily.

    At this time, the District Party Secretary asked:
      “Where will you get fertilizer for your ten-thousand-jin field?”
      “We’ll pick it up ourselves!” one child replied.
      “What about chemical fertilizer? Your field isn’t that good…” the District Party Secretary said, clearly wanting to help them but not saying it directly.

    The children looked at each other, and Hu Chunlin shyly opened his mouth:
    “Please help us a little, Commune…”

    Guan Musheng patted his shoulder and immediately issued a slip for thirty jin of chemical fertilizer.

    This gave the children even more energy.

    The District Party Secretary asked:
    “What about technique? Growing ten-thousand-jin rice isn’t just about enthusiasm, you need technique, and you don’t understand…”
    “We’ll learn!” the children interrupted him. “We’ll learn from Director Guan!”

    This made Guan Musheng laugh and say, “Teach, teach, teach.”

    This made the children's story spread. But some people were still unconvinced and asked them for slogans, “What are your slogans?” They hadn't thought about it beforehand and had to say, “We won’t tell you now!” That night, they held a meeting, and the next day, they also put up a sign in the field. It read:

    Not wanting fertile fields, not wanting (bean) cakes
    Each mu must harvest ten thousand jin of rice
    Young heroes compete with Luo Cheng
    Surely surpass Director Guan

    Soon, the County Party Committee also learned about this and thought it was extraordinary. After discussing it with Guan Musheng, they decided to convene a commune members' meeting to have Hu Chunlin give a report about their story of growing ten-thousand-jin rice, both to encourage the children and to encourage everyone. But when the meeting opened and Hu Chunlin went up to speak—it was incredible, many people said: “Are we living worse than children!” More than a hundred people signed up on the spot, deciding to dig five mu of land and conduct a ten-thousand-jin experiment. They dug one and a half chi deep in three days, and people couldn’t walk in it, cows would sink to their bellies, and even double-wheeled, double-shared plows were useless, so they had to pull the plows themselves. They worked desperately, plowing for two days and one night, and then the seedlings were planted.

    Thus, under the leadership and encouragement of the Party, Changfeng Commune truly seemed to be riding the wind and breaking the waves, vigorously pursuing ten-thousand-jin rice. The experimental fields developed from five fen to five mu, and from five mu to one hundred and fifty mu; and that's not all, they also developed from harvesting ten thousand jin in double-cropping to harvesting ten thousand jin in single-cropping.

    All the commune members were filled with soaring enthusiasm, and teams competed with teams, people with people, fathers and sons, husbands and wives, and brothers, in a large-scale labor competition.

    Harvesting ten thousand jin of rice per mu is no simple matter; it's something that has never been seen "through the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties." Everyone understood that with enthusiasm, they also needed to have a spirit of inquiry, learn technology, master the growth laws of rice, and allow the rice to grow according to people's will.

    At the initiative of the County Party Committee, the commune cooperated with the technology promotion station to establish a "Ten-Thousand-Jin University," with Guan Musheng as the principal. There are already 236 students studying, and many more are applying. The method of learning is a combination of theory and practice, listening to lectures on one hand and going down to the fields on the other. The conditions for graduation are: being able to grow ten-thousand-jin rice and being able to explain the ten-thousand-jin rationale.

    At the entrance of Ten-Thousand-Jin University, there is a poem inscribed, as well as a large satirical cartoon series—

        Ten-Thousand-Jin University has opened,
        Conservative thinking is scared away,
        Foreign PhDs are jumping in fright,
        Peasants are laughing with joy.
        As long as we add a spirit of inquiry to our enthusiasm,
        A yield of double ten thousand per mu is also achievable.

    乘长风破万里浪
    ——湖北孝感长风社万斤水稻试验田的诞生
    本报特约记者　方纪
    今年的小麦高产，大大刺激了人们的想像。尤其对于农业战线上的人们。湖北孝感长风社主任官木生，是首创水稻千斤丰产的全国农业劳动模范。大跃进以来，到处是鼓足干劲、力争上游，他就想：“我拿?事跃进？过去水稻最多只收得三百几，现在收到三千，增加了九倍；再来搞个亩产万斤怎么样？”
    他想了，但不敢讲。觉得要搞不成，还算得个啥模范哩！他决心搞试验，但只搞了五分田。挖得尺二深，施了不少肥。旁人看他有些怪，就问：“官主任，搞试验哩？多少？”
    起初他还是不肯讲，因为他记得当初搞千斤稻时，就有不少人讲他的怪话。当时还有人给他编了歌：“唐宋元明清，没见过水稻产千斤；我们社出了吹主任，要收一千一百斤。”现在搞万斤，搞不成，更成“吹”主任了。问他的人越来越多，不讲不行了，他就索性把牌子打出去：
    “官木生水稻试验田，五分，亩产一万零六十斤。”
    这可把人们吓了一跳，大家都来看这块牌子——牌子虽小，可不简单。敢讲话的，一个没有。
    人们不讲话，原因也复杂。讲怪话的，不敢了，大跃进嘛！响应，一万斤，不那么容易，要考虑考虑。
    那知正在这时候，一天早上，官主任的田旁边，也插了一块牌子，数目是一万零一百斤，又多出四十斤。挑战的是八个水稻姑娘，为首的是赵翠云、余小英。牌子上还写了四句诗：
    亩产万斤声如雷，
    电光闪闪好惊人！
    姐妹们来加把劲，
    一定赛过官主任。
    两块牌子面对面站着，两块田边挨边连着。这一来，全社轰动了。青年、妇女、老人、连小孩子，都来搞万斤田，都来赛官主任。
    这一下老官心里有了底，没想到五分田发动了群众。
    这里别的人先不讲，单讲一群孩子的故事。
    长风社第六生产队有一个小孩叫胡春林，十二岁。社里搞起万斤稻以后，他感觉生活有些两样，到处找不到一个同他耍的，全社的人白天黑夜都长在田里。他便找了九个孩子商量好，一道去找生产队长要田，要搞万斤稻。这位队长的思想那时还没有彻底解放，还有点瞧小孩子不起。便说：“你还没有谷子高，搞的什么万斤稻！”一句话把小孩子气恼了，说：“大人干得，小孩子也干得；大人搞大田，小人搞小田嘛！”他们一赌气走了。他们不但没有泄气，没有吓倒，反倒决心更大了，非搞不可。
    于是他们到处找地。地都种满了，连道旁田边的小块荒地也种上了——现在的农村，哪里会有闲地？他们没得办法想，便决定去挖老坟。白天怕大人骂，而且工具都占着，拿不到，只好晚上挖。
    第一晚挖到半夜十二点，一分地，只挖得五寸深。第二天便挖不动了，因为是老荒坟，天又旱，地板着实硬。同时，又被大人发觉了，骂他们“搞万斤田连祖宗也不要了！”硬从田里拉他们回来。
    第三天晚上，他们搞到下一点，抬了一百二十桶水，把又干又硬的老荒坟，硬是泼松了。这一来，挖得就顺利了，一直挖到尺半深，方才住手。
    社里知道了他们的事。官主任和区委书记拿出三毛钱，买了糖，找他们来开会。糖嘛，每人分得两块，区委书记开玩笑说：“一块糖五千斤，两块糖就得搞到一万斤，行不行？”
    孩子们很是出乎意外，高兴得一齐笑起来。
    这时，区委书记才问：
      “你们搞万斤田肥料哪里来？”
      “我们自己捡嘛！”一个孩子回答。
      “化肥呢？你们的田可不算好……”区委书记又说，他明明是想帮助他们，却又不直接讲。
    孩子们互相望了望，胡春林不好意思地开口道：
    “请社里帮一点子……”
    官木生拍拍他的肩膀，立刻给开了一张三十斤化肥的条子。
    这一下，孩子们劲头更足了。
    区委书记又问：
    “技术呢？搞万斤田光凭干劲还不行，要技术，你们不懂……”
    “不懂学嘛！”孩子们不等他说完，一齐接上去。“我们向官主任学！”
    说得官木生好笑起来，连说：“教，教，教。”
    这一来，孩子们的事传开了。可是还有人不服，有人问他们要口号，“你们的口号哩？”他们事先没想到，只得说：“现在不告诉你！”到晚上，他们开了个会，第二天，也在田里插起一块牌子。上写道：
    不要良田不要（豆）饼
    每亩要收稻万斤
    少年英雄赛罗成
    一定压倒官主任
    很快，县委也知道了这件事，觉得不简单。和官木生一商量，决定召集一次社员大会，让胡春林出来作个报告，讲讲他们搞万斤田的故事，一来鼓励孩子们，二来也鼓励大家。那知这个大会一开，胡春林跑上去一讲——可不得了，许多人说：“难道活得不如个孩子了！”当场一百多人签名，决定挖五亩田，搞万斤试验。三天挖了尺半深，人下去走不动，牛下去兜肚皮，双轮双铧犁也没有办法，只好人拉了犁耕。拼命干，耕了两天一晚上，秧子栽下去。
    这样，在党的领导和鼓舞下，长风社真像是乘长风破万里浪，大搞起万斤水稻来了。试验田从五分发展到五亩，从五亩发展到一百五十亩；这还不算，又从双季收万斤，发展到单季万斤。
    全体社员干劲冲天，队与队，人与人，父子、夫妻、兄弟，展开了大规模的劳动竞赛。
    一亩田收一万斤稻子，好不简单，也是“唐宋元明清”从来没有过的事。大家明白，有了干劲，还要有钻劲，学技术，掌握水稻的生长规律，让稻子按人的意志长才行。
    经县委倡议，社里和技术推广站合作，办了一所“万斤大学”，官木生当校长，已经有学员二百三十六人在学习，报名的还很多。学习的方法是理论和实践相结合，一面听讲，一面下田。毕业的条件是：种得出万斤稻，讲得出万斤道理。
    在万斤大学门口，题了一首诗，还有一大幅讽刺性的连环画——
        万斤大学开学了，
        保守思想吓得跑，
        洋博士他吓得跳，
        农民喜得哈哈笑。
        只要干劲加钻劲，
        亩产双万也做得到。
