    Having read the letter from Qin Xiulan to her husband, published on the fourth page of the People's Daily on July 6th, I read it over and over again. Her words struck a chord in my heart, and I couldn't help but recall my own experiences. I am an educated housewife. When I was still in school, I made vows with my female classmates: to participate in social work, to strive for women's independence, not to be parasites, not to be household slaves. At the age of eighteen, I graduated from high school with excellent grades, and full of enthusiasm, I went everywhere to look for work, but I ran into walls everywhere. In the old society, where there were more people than jobs, unemployment upon graduation was common, and women were even more likely to be unemployed. Helpless, I had to listen to my family's advice: "Just marry someone, and you'll be set for life." Since then, bearing children, cooking and washing clothes, sewing and mending, ten years have passed in the blink of an eye. The ten years have passed easily, but the mood in those ten years was like a pot of boiling oil, indescribably painful.

    After liberation, my mood gradually became more cheerful, because I participated in street work, and devoted half of my body and mind to serving the people. During this period, there were several opportunities for employment, but I did not actively strive for them. Firstly, because my household chores were heavy, and I couldn’t completely free myself. Secondly, my understanding had improved. I thought, "The country is still in a period of recovery. Many unemployed young and middle-aged people left over from the old society have not yet been fully employed. I should first be diligent and thrifty in managing my household, and doing a good job in housework is also indirectly contributing to the country. Housework in the new society is also glorious." It wasn't until this time, adapting to the needs of the rapidly advancing socialist construction, that nurseries, canteens, and sewing groups were set up on the streets, that I was able to completely leave the family, dedicate myself to society, and directly participate in the ranks of building socialist mansions. My excitement is indescribable. I believe that thousands upon thousands of sisters feel the same way as I do. We are not willing to be buried at home forever, just spinning around the "three stoves". We have endless potential to offer to the new society. We long to participate in work like our male comrades, to live in a large family, so that we can contribute more strength and get more exercise. This enthusiasm and strength of us women in building socialism should be supported and sponsored by our male comrades.

    These days, the neighborhood is especially lively, with people going in and out, all with smiles on their faces. Just recently, more than 16,000 people here have been put into more than 70 kinds of processing and service labor. Women mobilized and could accomplish so many things in a short time, even I didn't expect it before. Now we come out in the morning, send our children to nurseries and kindergartens, and then go to work. When we get off work in the evening, we pick up our children and go home together. We eat in the canteen, bathe in the bathroom, and wash and mend clothes. If we have time, we do it ourselves, and if we don't have time, we send it out. During the day in the big family, we work together, live together, and at night in the small family, we rest together and talk about family affairs. The direction of the two families is consistent, the feelings are harmonious, and our spiritual and material life is richer. I can't help but cheer. I deeply feel that only in a society where the working class is in power can women be completely liberated, can they fully发挥 their enthusiasm and creativity, and can there be true equality between men and women.

### 支持妇女社会主义的热情

    支持妇女社会主义的热情
    7月6日人民日报第四版上发表的秦绣兰给她丈夫的信，我是读了一遍又一遍。她的话几乎句句都说到了我的心坎上，我不由得回想起了自己的经历。我是个有文化的家庭妇女，还在学校的时候，就曾经和女同学们一起立过誓愿：要参加社会工作，要争取妇女独立，不做寄生虫，不做家庭奴隶。十八岁那年，我以优异的成绩在高中毕了业，抱着满腔热情，到处去找工作，却到处碰壁。在那人浮于事的旧社会里，毕业即失业，妇女当然更加难以幸免。没奈何，我只得听从家中劝告：“嫁个人算了，终身有靠。”从此，生养孩子，做饭洗衣，缝缝补补，转眼就是十年。十年的岁月好过，十年中的心情却似一锅熬油，说不出的难过。
    解放了，我的心情才渐渐舒畅起来，因为我参加了街道工作，把身心分了一半去为人民服务了。这期间，也曾有过几次可以就业的机会，但是我没有积极争取，一则因为我家务繁重，还不能够完全拔出身来，二则我的认识已有提高，我想：“国家还处在恢复时期，旧社会遗下的许多失业的青壮年也还没有全部就业，我首先应该勤俭持家，把家务搞好，也就间接为国家出了力，新社会的家务劳动也是光荣的。”直到这次，适应着飞速前进的社会主义建设的需要，街道上办起了托儿所、食堂、缝纫组，我才能够完全走出家庭，献身社会，直接参加到建设社会主义大厦的行列中来。我的兴奋是难以形容的，我相信千千万万个姐妹们都和我有同感。我们并不愿意一辈子无休无止地只是埋在家里围着“三台”转，我们有无穷的潜力，要献给新社会。我们想望着同男同志一样，参加工作，过大家庭生活，好让我们贡献出更多的力量，也得到更多的锻炼。我们妇女们建设社会主义的这种热情和力量，是应该得到男同志们的支持和赞助的。
    这几天胡同里分外热闹，人们进进出出，个个面带笑容。才不久，我们这里已经有一万六千多人投入了七十多种加工性和服务性的劳动。妇女们发动起来，一时就能办出这么多的事情来，就连我以前也没有意料到。现在我们早晨出来，把孩子送到托儿所、幼儿园，然后上工去，晚上下工，接孩子一同回家。吃饭上食堂，洗澡有浴室，衣服洗补，有空自己动手，没空就送出去。白天在大家庭里，同劳动，同生活，晚上在小家庭里，同休息，同话家常。两种家庭的方向是一致的，感情是合拍的，我们的精神和物质生活更加丰富了。我忍不住要欢呼起来。我深深感到，只有工人阶级掌政的社会，妇女才能完全解放，才能充分发挥积极性创造性，才能真正男女平等。
