	Using Poetry, Art, and Drama to Vigorously Attack the Ambition Wolves
	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing Branch Reporter
	Every painting is a bomb striking the aggressors, and every poem is a vow to defend peace. On the evening of July 25th, more than 20,000 people in Beijing, carrying their own poems, cartoons, and living newspaper plays, gathered in sixteen locations at the Working People's Cultural Palace to condemn and protest the armed aggression of the Middle East by American and British imperialism and their interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries.
	The Cultural Palace was filled with stirring songs: "We support you, Arab brothers!" "American aggressors get out of Lebanon!" "British aggressors get out of Jordan!" In the ancient cypress groves, people expressed their sense of justice and anger, and cheered the national independence movement of the Middle Eastern people through cartoons, poems, and dramas.
	In the west of the Cultural Garden, workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant performed the Peking Opera "The Fate of the Aggressors." Amidst the sounds of gongs and drums, American and British imperialism frantically invaded Middle Eastern countries. Actors playing peace-loving people from around the world held up signs reading "American and British robbers get out of the Middle East" and staged demonstrations. At this time, more than twenty steelworkers and railway workers watching the play couldn't contain their anger and jumped onto the stage to join the demonstration, scaring the "Eisenhower" and "Macmillan" actors on stage into running away. The audience then shouted in unison, "Get out!" "Get out!"
	On the stage of the stadium, the White House president's office appeared, with Eisenhower frantically clamoring about the news of the establishment of the Republic by the Iraqi people. This was the living newspaper play "Night at the White House," written and performed by workers from the North China Radio Equipment Factory. The seven actors participating in the performance were all on stage for the first time. With a heart full of hatred for imperialism and a desire to expose its ugly face, they automatically rehearsed this play.
	A large crowd surrounded the grandstand in the West Tree Forest. People were watching a play performed by students from Beijing Normal University. On stage, a hideous American devil was chasing a Lebanese woman. When she refused to submit, the American devil stabbed her to death with a bayonet. At this point, the audience could no longer bear it and shouted slogans: "Down with American imperialism!" Suddenly, an old woman stood up from the crowd and ran to the stage, saying incoherently, "One of my daughters-in-law was killed by the devils like this..." She couldn't continue speaking because of her crying. The masses were enraged, and the slogans of "American imperialism get out of Lebanon!" were shouted even louder.
	On the stage of the Cultural Garden, more than ten students from Peking University loudly recited "Get Out! Get Out! Get Out!" They used roaring voices to tell the American and British imperialist elements: "Our hands drive the leaping Great Leap Forward's steed, with a speed a thousand times faster than John Bull; with a wave of our hands, rivers change course, and mountains make way; today these hands give you a fiery protest, ordering you to obediently get out of the Middle East! If the claws invading the Middle East are not withdrawn, we will send you to the grave." Then, a heroic song was sung on stage, and the audience repeatedly shouted, "Arab brothers, we support you!"
	Around the grandstand behind the honor roll, people were attracted by the living newspaper play "Setting Fire to Oneself," performed by workers from the Xinhua Printing Factory. The workers vividly portrayed the ugliness of the American and British aggressors. The play was hastily written by four typesetting workers from the factory overnight. They wrote, typeset, and performed it themselves. Worker Wang Minghua usually doesn't like to talk and has never participated in literary or artistic performances, but this time he took the initiative to participate. He said: "I hate imperialism to the core and must express my angry feelings."
	Around each stage, hundreds of poems and paintings were posted and hung, depicting the heroic spirit of the Arab people and also revealing the black hearts of the American and British pirates. Arab brothers! This is not just a worker's poem, it is the voice of 600 million people: "What sound is this so loud? It is the call of our 600 million people! What is blocking the sun? It is the banner of peace, the fist of anger! Get out! You American and British robbers, the coffin is your real mansion..."
	Before the start of the mass literary and artistic creation performance meeting, Yang Shu, the Minister of Propaganda of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, gave a speech. After analyzing the situation in the Middle East, he pointed out: American and British imperialism are mad dogs, and we should hold our sticks firmly and not allow the mad dogs to bite people.
	This mass literary and artistic creation performance meeting continued until 11 p.m.

    用诗画戏剧痛击野心狼
    新华社北京分社记者
    每一张画都是打击侵略者的炸弹，每一首诗都是保卫和平的誓言。北京市二万多群众带着自己创作的诗歌、漫画、活报剧，25日晚在劳动人民文化宫分十六处举行集会，谴责和抗议美英帝国主义武装侵略中东，干涉阿拉伯各国人民内政。
    文化宫里到处是激昂的歌声：“我们支持你，阿拉伯兄弟！”“美国侵略军从黎巴嫩滚出去！”“英国侵略军从约旦滚出去！”在古柏丛中，人们用漫画、诗歌和戏剧，表达自己的正义感和愤怒，欢呼中东人民的民族独立运动。
    在文化园的西面，石景山钢铁厂的职工演出京剧“侵略者的下场”。在锣鼓声中，美英帝国主义疯狂地对中东国家进兵侵略，扮演全世界爱好和平人民的演员，高举“美英强盗滚出中东”的标语牌，举行示威游行。这时，在台下看戏的二十多个钢铁工人和铁路工人，抑制不住心头的愤怒，纷纷跳到台上自动加入了游行示威的行列，吓得台上的“艾森豪威尔”和“麦克米伦”跳到台下逃走。这时观众们齐声急呼：“滚出去！”“滚出去！”
    体育场的舞台上，出现了白宫总统的办公室，艾森豪威尔对着伊拉克人民建立了共和国的消息在疯狂地叫嚣。这是华北无线电器材厂工人们自编自演的活报剧“白宫之夜”。参加演出的有七个演员，都是第一次登台。他们怀着一颗仇恨帝国主义、揭露帝国主义丑恶面貌的心，自动排演了这出戏。
    西树林的看台前围着一大群人。人们正在看北京师范学院的学生演戏。台上，一个面目狰狞的美国鬼子正在追赶一个黎巴嫩妇女，这个妇女不从，美国鬼子就用刺刀把她杀死了。这时，台下的观众实在忍受不住了，大声喊起口号来：“打倒美帝国主义！”忽然间，从人群中站起一个老太太，她跑到台上，上句不接下句地说：“我的一个儿媳妇就是这样被鬼子杀死的……”她哭得说不下去。台下的群众激怒了，“美帝国主义滚出黎巴嫩！”的口号声喊得更响了。
    在文化园的舞台上，北京大学十多个学生大声地在朗诵着“滚！滚！滚！”他们用怒吼的声音向着美英帝国主义分子说：“我们这双手，驾起跃进的千里马，有比约翰牛快千百倍的速度；我们这双手一挥，河水改道，高山让路；今天这双手，投给你们的是火的抗议，命令你们，乖乖地从中东滚出去！如果侵略中东的魔爪不收回，我们就把你们送进坟墓去”。接着台上高唱起豪迈的歌曲，台下一再高呼“阿拉伯兄弟，我们支持你！”
    在光荣榜后面的看台周围，人们被新华印刷厂工人演出的活报剧“引火自焚”吸引住了。工人们把美英侵略者的丑态演得维妙维肖。这个剧是这个工厂四个排字工人用一夜功夫赶写成的。他们自写、自排、自演。工人王明华平日不爱说话，从没参加过文艺演出，这次他主动要求参加。他说：“我恨透了帝国主义，一定要把我的愤怒心情表一表。”
    在每个舞台的周围，张贴和悬挂着上百幅的诗和画，人们画出了阿拉伯人民的英勇气概，也画透美英海盗的黑心肠。阿拉伯兄弟！这不只是一首工人的诗，这是六亿人民的声音：“是什么声音这样响？是我们六亿人民的呼声！是什么遮住了天日？是和平的旗帜，是愤怒的拳头！滚吧！你们这些美英强盗，棺材才是你们真正的大厦……”
    在群众文艺创作演出大会开始前，中共北京市委员会宣传部长杨述讲了话。他在分析中东局势以后指出：美英帝国主义是疯狗，我们应该拿好棍子，不准疯狗咬人。
    这个群众文艺创作演出大会一直表演到晚十一时。
