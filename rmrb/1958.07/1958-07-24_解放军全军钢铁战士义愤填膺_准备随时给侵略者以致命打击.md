Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force throughout the country have been angrily denouncing the U.S. and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East in recent days. They expressed their determination to heighten vigilance, intensify training, and be ready at any time to liberate Taiwan and give the aggressors a fatal blow to defend world peace.

　　In recent days, from Changbai Mountain to Hainan Island, from the coastal defense front to Xinjiang and the Tibetan Plateau, all units have held various forms of gatherings to condemn the U.S. and British imperialist crimes of aggression in the Middle East. An armored unit of the Beijing area launched a massive "Week of Opposition to U.S. and British Aggression in the Middle East" starting today. Slogans, cartoons, letters of determination, and protest letters were plastered all around the barracks, and the soldiers were all impassioned and eager to sign the protest letters. In the Jinan area, many companies held gatherings, some of which lasted from afternoon until late at night. The "Daigu Company," a famous heroic company in the Liberation War, each soldier expressed their determination to fight against aggression with excitement. The naval fleet stationed in the Guangzhou area held gatherings next to the cannons on warships for several days, and the officers and soldiers expressed their support for the just struggle of the Middle Eastern people. The cultural troupes and amateur performance teams of various units have also compiled many literary and artistic programs such as "Exposing the Wolfish Nature of Imperialism" and performed them in the companies.

　　In the various units, veteran volunteers who had participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea were angered by the crimes of U.S. and British aggression these days. They seriously warned the aggressors: "You should remember the tragic historical lessons of your defeat on the Korean battlefield, and don't play with fire and burn yourselves." Many people also used their own combat experiences to illustrate that U.S. imperialism is just a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak, and a defeated general under the hands of the Chinese and Korean people. Liu Yuti, an air force pilot who volunteered to participate in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and shot down or damaged eight U.S. aircraft on the Korean battlefield, and was awarded the title of first-class hero, told about how he beat the U.S. air bandits into a panic at the meeting. Many former volunteer soldiers believe that imperialism bullies the weak and fears the strong. In the early days of the Korean War, their planes flew low and indiscriminately bombed, massacring Korean residents. However, when our air force and anti-aircraft artillery units, along with the Korean People's Army, came out and gave them a heavy blow, their "air superiority" immediately went bankrupt, and they dared not be so rampant anymore.

　　These angered warriors, loyal to the motherland and the cause of peace, are unanimously determined to grip the guns in their hands and be ready at any time to cut off the claws of imperialism. Recently, the training results of many troops have been advancing by leaps and bounds. The officers and soldiers of the "Yang Lian Di Company" of a railway engineering unit that is building the Min-Dian Railway in the five southern provinces unanimously expressed their determination to speed up the project and complete it ahead of schedule to respond to the imperialist war provocations. The railway engineering troops in the northern section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway have recently created a new record of laying ten kilometers of track per day. The officers and soldiers who are building the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway are also determined to build the railway to Fuzhou ahead of schedule, consolidate national defense, and liberate Taiwan as soon as possible.

    解放军全军钢铁战士义愤填膺
    准备随时给侵略者以致命打击
    新华社23日讯　全国各地中国人民解放军陆、海、空三军官兵连日来愤怒斥责美英帝国主义在中东的侵略行为，他们表示：提高警惕，加紧训练，随时准备解放台湾，给侵略者以致命的打击，以保卫世界和平。
    连日来，从长白山到海南岛，从海防前线到新疆和康藏高原，所有的部队都分别举行了各种形式的集会，声讨美英帝国主义侵略中东的罪行。北京地区装甲兵某部，从今天起开展了一个声势浩大的“反对美英侵略中东运动周”，各部队营房周围贴遍了标语、漫画、决心书和抗议书，战士们个个激昂慷慨，争相在抗议书上签名。济南地区部队许多连队的班、排都举行集会，有些集会从下午直开到深夜。解放战争中著名的英雄连队“岱崮连”，每一个战士都激动地表示了反侵略斗争的决心。驻广州地区的海军舰队，连日在军舰上的大炮旁集会，官兵们纷纷表示声援中东人民的正义斗争。各部队的文工团和战士业余演出队，也编排出“揭穿帝国主义豺狼本性”等许多文艺节目，深入到连队演出。
    在各部队里，曾经志愿参加过抗美援朝战争的志愿军老战士，这几天被美英侵略罪行激怒了。他们严重警告侵略者：“应该记取你们在朝鲜战场上惨败的历史教训，不要玩火自焚。”许多人并且十分豪迈地用自己切身的战斗经历说明美帝国主义不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎，是中朝人民手下的败将。曾志愿参加抗美援朝，在朝鲜战场上击落击伤美国飞机八架，获得一级英雄称号的空军飞行员刘玉堤，在集会上讲述当年把美国空中强盗打得抱头鼠窜的情形。许多原志愿军战士都认为帝国主义是欺软怕硬的，朝鲜战争初期，它们的飞机曾到处低飞滥炸，残杀朝鲜居民，但是当我们和朝鲜人民军的空军、高射炮部队一出动，给了它狠狠的打击以后，它的“空中优势”就立即破产，再也不敢那么猖狂了。
    这些被激怒了的忠于祖国、忠于和平事业的战士们，一致决心握紧手中枪，随时准备斩断帝国主义的魔爪。最近，许多部队的训练成绩都在突飞猛进。正在修建南方五省闽滇大铁路的铁道兵某部“杨连第连”的官兵们一致表示要加快工程速度，提前完工，回答帝国主义的战争挑衅。包（头）兰（州）铁路北段的铁道兵部队，最近两天创造了铺轨日进十公里的新纪录。正在修建南（平）福（州）铁路的官兵，也决心提前把铁路修到福州，巩固国防，早日解放台湾。
