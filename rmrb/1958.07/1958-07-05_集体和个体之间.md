    Between the Collective and the Individual
    Agricultural cooperatives are collective production organizations, but they are also formed by countless individual farmers.
    The collective and the individual are contradictory yet unified. The unity lies in the fact that collective interests include individual interests, and individual interests can only depend on collective interests. Therefore, when dealing with the relationship between the collective and the individual, we must appropriately consider individual interests under the principle of individual interests being subordinate to collective interests, and we cannot "benefit the individual at the expense of the collective." Because, if we only take care of the individual without taking care of the collective, the collective cannot be consolidated and developed, and may even disintegrate into individuals. Conversely, if the individual submits to the collective and wholeheartedly seeks the consolidation and development of the collective, the individual's interests will also be satisfied with the development of the collective.
    The members of Nahua Agricultural Cooperative in Tiandeng County, Guangxi, have already understood this principle from this rectification and consolidation of the commune, and corrected the practice of "benefiting the individual at the expense of the collective." It is hoped that all those who have problems in balancing the collective and the individual can correct the idea and practice of "benefiting the individual at the expense of the collective."

    集体和个体之间
    农业合作社是集体生产组织，但又是由无数个体农户结合成的。
    集体和个体，是矛盾的而又是统一的。统一，就是集体利益包括了个体利益，个体利益只能依存于集体利益。因此，对待集体和个体的关系，必须是在个体利益服从集体利益的原则下，适当照顾个体利益，而不能是“亏众不亏一”。因为，如果只照顾个体而不照顾集体，集体就不能巩固、发展，甚至有瓦解成为个体的危险。相反，如果个体服从集体，一心一意求得集体的巩固、发展，个体的利益也就会随着集体的发展而得到满足。
    广西天等县那花农业社的社员，已经从这次整风整社中悟出了这个道理，纠正了“亏众不亏一”的做法。但愿所有在集体和个体的摆法上有问题的人，都能纠正“亏众不亏一”的想法和做法。
