    Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 16th: The construction project of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex has entered a full-scale construction high tide. Since the beginning of the third quarter, more than eighty projects in the Baiyun鄂博 Iron Ore Mine, iron smelting, steelmaking, coking, refractory materials, water source, and other systems have started construction simultaneously. Li Chao, Deputy General Manager of Baogang, told reporters: The construction progress of Baogang has accelerated again, and the production scale has increased again. It will not only guarantee the iron tapping of No. 1 blast furnace on National Day next year but also guarantee the steel production of a large open hearth furnace next year.
    This is another leap forward by Baogang employees under the inspiration of the General Line, after implementing investment contracting and decentralization of power. This leap forward requires an advance increase in the supply of mechanical and electrical equipment and building materials, which is a new problem in the context of the nationwide leap forward in capital construction. However, Baogang employees, on the basis of emancipating their minds and breaking superstitions, have found a way to solve this problem, which is the two guiding measures proposed by the Baogang Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, concentrating the opinions of the masses.
    The first measure is to self-manufacture equipment and building materials and strive for self-reliance. In terms of equipment, the Mechanical General Plant and the Electrical Repair Plant are the main forces, organizing the machine repair workshops and work sections of various units to self-manufacture mechanical and electrical equipment; first manufacture small and medium-sized and relatively simple ones, and gradually achieve the ability to completely self-manufacture rolling mills of more than 650 mm, cranes of 350 tons, as well as medium-pressure blowers and motors of more than 1,000 horsepower within one or two years. In terms of building materials, the Production Enterprise Company is the main force, organizing material supply and processing units to gradually achieve an annual output of more than 50,000 tons of cement, more than 50,000 tons of steel bars, steel pipes, steel wire ropes, etc., and 100,000 square meters of asbestos products.
    The second measure is to implement the policy of large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously within Baogang enterprises. On the premise of ensuring the advancement of the construction progress of Baogang's major factories and mines, the iron smelting, steelmaking, and rolling mills will respectively open iron smelting plants with an annual output of 300,000 to 400,000 tons, steelmaking plants with 200,000 to 300,000 tons, and medium plate plants with 100,000 to 150,000 tons, forming a "small Baogang" in a concentrated manner. At the same time, the ore dressing plant will open an ore dressing plant with an annual output of 3 million tons in advance, and the iron mine will open a small iron and steel plant with an annual output of more than 100,000 tons. The investment in these small and medium-sized enterprises opened by large factories and mines is borrowed from the contracting fees of the large factories and mines and repaid with the recovered profits.
    These two measures have further mobilized the positive factors of the entire company. In the past few days, the construction of "Small Baogang" has started. The Mechanical General Plant is manufacturing equipment for "Small Baogang," and various production and construction units have already established a number of small blast furnaces, small converters, small coke ovens, small cement kilns, etc.

    在企业内部实行大中小并举
    大包钢小包钢齐头并进
    据新华社包头16日电　包头钢铁联合企业的建设工程全面施工高潮到来了。进入第三季度以来，白云鄂博铁矿山、炼铁、炼钢、焦化、耐火材料、水源等系统，八十多项工程同时兴工。包钢副总经理李超对记者说：包钢的建设进度又加快了，生产规模又加大了，不仅要保证一号高炉明年国庆出铁，还要保证一座大型平炉明年出钢。
    这是包钢在实行投资包干、权力下放以后，职工们在总路线鼓舞下又一次跃进。这次跃进，要求机电设备和建筑材料提前增加供应，这在全国基本建设大跃进的形势下，是一个新的难题。但是包钢职工在解放思想、打破迷信的基础上，找到了解决这个难题的途径，这就是中共包钢委员会集中群众意见提出的两项方针性措施。
    第一个措施是自制设备、自制建筑材料、力争自力更生。设备方面，以机械总厂和电修厂为主，组织各单位机修车间和工段，自制机械和电气设备；首先制造中小型的和比较简单的，一两年内逐步达到能完全自制六百五十米厘以上的轧钢机，三百五十吨的吊车，以及中压鼓风机和一千马力以上的马达等。建筑材料方面，以生产企业公司为主，组织材料供应和加工单位，逐步达到年产水泥五万吨以上，钢筋、钢管、钢丝绳等五万多吨，石棉制品十万平方公尺。
    第二项措施是在包钢企业内部实行大、中、小并举的方针。在保证包钢各大厂矿建设进度提前的条件下，由炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等厂，分别开办年产三十到四十万吨的炼铁厂，二十到三十万吨的炼钢厂，十到十五万吨的中板厂，集中组成一个“小包钢”。同时，由选矿厂提前开办一个年产三百万吨的选矿厂，铁矿山开办一个年产十多万吨的小型钢铁厂。这些由大厂矿开办的中小型企业，投资由大厂矿包干费内借用，用收回的利润归还。
    这两项措施，进一步动员起了全公司的积极因素。这几天，“小包钢”的建设开工了。机械总厂正为“小包钢”制造设备，各生产建设单位，已办起了一批小高炉、小转炉、小焦炉、小水泥窑等。
