Taking Steel as the Key Link, Geology Keeps Up
Jiangsu Mobilizes the Masses to Find "Treasures"

(Our Nanjing dispatch, July 11) A mass movement of the entire people to find treasures is about to take shape in Jiangsu. The original target of prospecting for six million tons of iron ore this year has jumped to 135 million tons.

In recent years, geological work in Jiangsu has lagged far behind the development of the situation. Some people mistakenly believed that "Jiangsu has no minerals." Many geological workers believed that geological work could only be done by a small number of people from the Geological Bureau. In exploration work, they have long followed old rules and regulations. It takes one or two months to complete just the design.

In the past few months, Jiangsu has rapidly established geological teams in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Xuzhou and other places, conducting in-depth general surveys and explorations in various special districts. They also utilized the strength of 250 students from Nanjing Geological School in Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Huaiyin and other special districts, cooperating with the masses in reporting mines, conducting general surveys while filling in maps, and mining while exploring to meet the needs of counties and townships to develop industrial resources in a timely manner.

Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Geological Bureau held a geological work conference for cadres above the team leader level. The conference criticized the "Jiangsu has no minerals" theory and put forward the slogan of action "Taking steel as the key link, geology keeps up." It demanded that iron be taken as the center, minerals be sought based on the minerals, indigenous and foreign methods be combined, mining and exploration be carried out simultaneously, key points be grasped and universal blossoming be achieved, and the backward situation of geological work be basically reversed in two years of hard work to fully guarantee the needs of industrial mineral resources. Specific measures were put forward to speed up the progress of geological work: (1) Strengthen the leadership of the Party and expand the geological team, decentralizing the existing large teams to the leadership of the special districts. The entire province, from special districts and counties to townships, will form a mass geological work network. (2) The whole Party should grasp the work, the whole people should dig, and the mass line should be followed. Give full play to the enthusiasm of old miners and farmers with experience in finding minerals. On the basis of the general survey and visits by students of geological schools, a group of students from Nanjing University has recently been organized into five large teams to carry out large-scale general surveys and mineral prospecting in several key special districts in southern and northern Jiangsu. (3) Break all outdated rules and regulations, stipulating that small mines do not need to be designed, the terrain can be simply measured, exploration reports can be approved by special districts and counties, and urgently needed minerals can be designed and explored simultaneously.

Now, the general survey teams organized by various special districts and students are cooperating with the masses to report mines, and new mineral deposits are constantly appearing. According to reports from the masses and proven explorations, there are many mineral deposits in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangning, Xuzhou, Suzhou, Lishui, Liyang, Ganyu, Suqian and other places. There are sporadically distributed areas that stretch for more than twenty miles, and there are ore veins that extend for four kilometers.

### 以钢为纲  地质跟上  江苏发动群众找“宝”

    以钢为纲  地质跟上
    江苏发动群众找“宝”
    本报南京11日电　一个群众性的全民找宝运动即将在江苏形成。原订今年探出六百万吨铁矿石的指标，一跃而为一亿三千五百万吨。
    几年来，江苏的地质工作远远落后于形势的发展。有些人错误地认为“江苏无矿”。不少地质工作人员以为地质工作只能由地质局少数人干。在勘探工作上，长期因袭着旧的规章制度。仅编设计就得一两月才能完成。
    最近几个月内，江苏迅速地建立了南京、镇江、苏州、徐州等地质大队，深入各专区普查勘探。他们还运用了南京地质学校的二百五十个学生的力量，在扬州、徐州、淮阴等专区，配合群众报矿，一边普查、一边填图，边采边探及时满足县乡发展工业资源的需要。
    最近，江苏省地质局召开了分队长以上干部的地质工作会议。批判了“江苏无矿论”，提出了“以钢为纲，地质跟上”的行动口号。要求以铁为中心，就矿找矿，土洋结合，边采边探，抓住重点普遍开花，苦战两年基本上扭转地质工作落后局面，充分保证工业上矿产资源的需要。对迅速加快地质工作的进度，提出具体措施：（1）加强党的领导，扩大地质队伍，将现有的各大队下放专区领导。全省从专区、县、到乡组成一个群众性的地质工作网。（2）全党抓、全民挖，大走群众路线。充分发挥老矿工和有找矿经验的农民的积极性。在地质学校学生普查遍访的基础上，最近又组织南京大学一批学生，组成五个大队，在苏南苏北几个重点专区开展大面积的普查找矿工作。（3）打破一切陈规陋矩，规定小矿不作设计，地形可以简测，勘探报告可由专区、县审批，急需的矿种可以边设计边勘探。
    现在，各专区和学生组织的普查大队配合群众报矿，新矿点不断出现。根据群众报矿和探明，南京、镇江、江宁、徐州、苏州、溧水、溧阳、赣榆、宿迁等地，都有很多矿点。有连续长达二十几里的星罗棋布地带，有延伸四公里长的矿脉。
