    Rapid Harvester
    Two Yuan a Piece, Harvests Ten Mu a Day
    The Fujian Provincial Farm Implement Experimental Factory has created a rapid harvester. One person operating it can harvest eight to ten mu of rice per day, increasing efficiency more than tenfold compared to using a sickle. Various regions are preparing to vigorously promote it.
    On the evening of June 20th, the Farm Implement Experimental Factory brought this newly created rapid harvester to the fields of the Huada Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Fuzhou for a demonstration, operated by female cooperative member Zhang Fengying. As she aimed the blade at the rice row and quickly pushed forward, bundles of rice neatly lay in the harvesting bag, immediately winning praise from the vast number of onlookers.
    The rapid harvester comes in single-row and double-row versions. The harvesting part consists of two semi-circular arc-shaped serrated thin iron pieces assembled into a horn-shaped angle. The bottom and sides are made of wooden boat-shaped skids and dividers. Above, a harvesting bag and a bamboo handle are attached with lead wire and linen. General scissor shops, sickle shops, and carpenters can all imitate it, with a cost of only two yuan. (Attached pictures)

    快速收割器
    一把两块钱　一天收十亩
    福建省农具试验厂创造一种快速收割器，一人操作一天，能割稻子八亩至十亩，比镰刀割稻效率提高十倍以上。各地准备大力推广。
    6月20日傍晚，农具试验厂把这种新创造的快速收割器拿到福州市郊华大农业社田里表演，由该社女社员张凤英操作。当她把刀口对准稻行迅速往前推行时，一束束稻子就安卧在盛禾袋里，当场博得广大参观者的赞扬。
    快速收割器分单行和双行两种。收割部分系由两片半圆弧形的锯齿薄铁片装成喇叭形的夹角，底部和两边均系木制的船形滑板和分禾器，上面用铅线和麻布装一盛禾袋和一把竹柄。一般剪刀铺、镰刀店和木匠都会仿造，成本只有两元。（附图片）
