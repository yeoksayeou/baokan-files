Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch. From the 9th to 8:00 AM on the 11th, widespread soaking rain fell in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Northern Shaanxi received 30 to 40 mm of rain, while southern Shaanxi received 10 to 18 mm; Northern Shanxi received 28 to 58 mm of rain, while southern Shanxi received 5 to 24 mm; Northern Hebei received 30 to 90 mm of rain, while southern Hebei received 10 to 30 mm; Western Inner Mongolia received 5 to 15 mm of rain, while central Inner Mongolia received 10 to 33 mm.

The area of this rainfall was further north than the rainfall from the 6th to the 7th, with a larger range and more even distribution, and the rainfall lasted longer. This has eliminated the drought in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which still had drought conditions after the previous rainfall. At present, cotton and corn in the above-mentioned areas are in the flowering season and require more water. Therefore, this rainfall is very beneficial to crops.

    山西陕西内蒙古等地
    普降透雨　旱象解除
    新华社11日讯　从9日到11日上午八时止，陕西、山西、河北、内蒙古自治区等地普降透雨。陕西北部降雨三十到四十公厘，南部降十到十八公厘；山西北部降二十八到五十八公厘，南部降五到二十四公厘；河北北部降三十到九十公厘，南部降十到三十公厘；内蒙古西部降五到十五公厘，中部降十到三十三公厘。
    这次降雨的地区，比6日到7日降雨地区较偏北，范围大，分布比较均匀，降雨的时间也长，使上次下雨后还有旱象的山西、陕西和内蒙古自治区，也解除了旱象。目前上述地区的棉花、玉米正处在开花季节，需要的水分较多。所以这次降雨对农作物很有好处。
