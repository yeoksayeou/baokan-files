    Stepping from the Carding Machine Directly Onto the Spinning Frame
    A Reform at the Dachen No. 1 Factory Shortens the Cotton Yarn Production Process by Two-Thirds
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th – A major technological reform has emerged in the cotton textile industry. The Dachen No. 1 Factory in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, has managed to have cotton go directly from the carding machine to the spinning frame, bypassing four processes: drawing, slubbing, and intermediate slubbing, shortening the cotton yarn production process by two-thirds. On the morning of June 28th, the factory used this method to spin high-quality grade one yarn. In the afternoon, the workers beat drums and gongs to report the good news to the Changzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, presenting this significant creation as a gift to celebrate the Party's birthday.
    This major innovation was proposed by Jin Depei, the Party Secretary of the Dachen No. 1 Factory, Xu Xiaotang, the Party Secretary of the Pre-Spinning Branch, Bao Quanzhi, workers Huang Alin, and technician Ju Linzhang, who then experimented and succeeded along with the workers. They installed a small auxiliary device with four pairs of rollers on the head of the carding machine, replacing the large number of drawing frames and roving frames in the workshop. This allowed cotton to be directly spun on the spinning frame after passing through the carding machine, shortening the flow speed from cotton to cotton yarn from twenty-four hours to eight hours. The success of this reform can save the country a significant amount of manpower, materials, and financial resources. Taking the Dachen No. 1 Factory as an example, this factory has less than 20,000 spindles. After eliminating the four processes of drawing and roving, it can save a total of 302,400 yuan per year in wages, electricity, machine materials, and repair costs; and save 144 laborers.

    从梳棉机一步跨上细纱车
    大成一厂的改革使棉纱生产过程缩短三分之二
    新华社南京30日电　棉纺工业出现了一项重大的技术改革。江苏省常州市大成一厂将棉花从梳棉机一步跨上了细纱车，越过并条、头粗、二粗等四道工序，使棉纱生产过程缩短了三分之二。6月28日上午，这个厂用这种方法纺出了上等一级好纱。下午，工人们敲锣打鼓地向中共常州市委报喜。把这个重大的创造作为向党的生日的献礼。
    这项重大创举，是大成一厂党委书记金德培、前纺支部书记须笑棠、保全志、工人黄阿林、技术人员鞠麟章等人提议，并同工人们一道试验成功的。他们在梳棉机龙头装上一个小小的附属装置，加四对罗拉，代替了排列在车间的一大片并条机和粗纱机，使棉花经过梳棉机就能直接上细纱机纺纱，从棉花到棉纱的流转速度，从二十四小时缩短到八小时。这项改革的成功，可以为国家节约大量人力、物力和财力。以大成一厂计算，这个厂纱锭不足二万枚，取消并条和粗纱四道工序后，一年可以节约工资、电费、机物料、修理费用等共三十万二千四百多元；节约劳动力一百四十四个。
