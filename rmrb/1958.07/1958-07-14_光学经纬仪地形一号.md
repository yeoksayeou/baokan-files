    Optical Theodolite Topographic Model One
    The Changchun Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, entrusted by the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, has successfully trial-produced the first domestic optical theodolite, Topographic Model One. The Appraisal Committee, composed of the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping and related units, conducted more than 20 indoor and outdoor appraisals of this instrument, including component inspection, angle measurement, correction checks, and vibration tests, proving that its accuracy has reached the international level.
    This theodolite has a wide range of applications and can be used for fourth-order triangulation, topographic surveying, and various surveying work in mining areas, exploration, farmland water conservancy, urban construction, national defense construction, etc. Its re-measurement mechanism is improved compared with foreign theodolites. The horizontal and vertical circles read directly to one minute, and the estimated reading is six seconds. The scribed lines on the glass reading reticle are only one-seventeenth the thickness of ordinary hair. Its characteristics are convenient operation, flexible rotation, and stable performance. During field observation, it encountered a level six gale, and its maximum zeroing error did not exceed 0.2 minutes.
    The successful trial production of Topographic Model One has laid a good foundation for my country to manufacture various automatic high-precision measuring instruments. Topographic Model One will soon be mass-produced by Xi'an Optical Instrument Factory, which will soon meet domestic needs and can also be exported to foreign countries.

    光学经纬仪地形一号
    长春中国科学院光学精密机械仪器研究所接受国家测绘总局的委托，试制成功了国产第一台光学经纬仪地形一号。测绘总局和有关单位组成鉴定委员会对这台仪器进行了室内和野外的二十多个项目的鉴定，其中包括部件检验、测角、校正检查和振动等试验，证明它的精度已经达到了国际水平。
    这种经纬仪应用范围很广，可以适用于四等三角测量、地形测量和矿区、勘探、农田水利、城市建设、国防建设等各种测量工作。它的复测机构比外国经纬仪都有改进，水平及垂直度盘直接读数一分，估计读数六秒，玻璃的读数分划板上的刻划线只有普通头发的十七分之一。它的特点是操作方便，转动灵活，性能稳定，在野外观测中曾遇六级大风，其归零误差最大未超过○·二分。
    地形一号的试制成功，为我国自制各种自动高精度测量仪器打下了良好的基础。地形一号即将由西安光学厂大批生产，不久即可满足国内需要，还可以向外国出口。　　（新华社）（附图片）
