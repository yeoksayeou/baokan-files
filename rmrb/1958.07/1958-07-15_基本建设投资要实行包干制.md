Basic Construction Investment Should Implement the Contract System

Under the situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward in production, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has piloted the investment contract system in some construction units. Three months of practice have yielded good results, initially realizing the battle cry of "Investment equals two, output doubles, speed doubles." It can be seen that the implementation of investment contracts is a major revolutionary measure to reform the basic construction management system, and it is also a red flag for further improving the production relations of basic construction and promoting the leap forward development of productive forces. Recently, the State Council summarized the experience of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and other aspects in implementing investment contracts, and issued the "Several Provisions on Improving the Financial Management System of Basic Construction." The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Finance also held an on-site meeting at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to promote this experience to the whole country. In this way, the red flag of investment contract is raised even higher.

The investment contract system is to ensure that under the conditions of not reducing production capacity, not delaying the completion date, not exceeding the total investment amount, and not increasing the proportion of non-productive construction, the basic construction investment is handed over to the construction departments and units for unified control, independent arrangement, and contracted use. That is, a certain amount of investment is given to a construction unit, requiring them to build a factory or mine of a certain production scale within a certain period of time, with the construction unit "taking care of everything." If the contract is well managed and less investment is spent, the state will not recover it, and the construction unit will use the saved investment to expand the production scale. Whoever has more ways to save money, the larger the construction scale can be, and whoever makes more contributions to the cause of socialist construction. This method is very popular among the masses. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry contracted 240 million yuan of construction investment to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. With the assistance of the design department and relying on the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, the construction scale of the plant was expanded from the planned original production of 600,000 tons of steel to 1.3 million tons, and the construction time was advanced from ten years to three years. This proves that investment contract is indeed a good way to increase production and save money.

It can be seen that the implementation of investment contracts can not only achieve the purpose of spending less money, but its advantages are multifaceted. From the experience of the metallurgical system that has already implemented investment contracts, they are implementing a "four-package" system, which requires contracting for "more work," contracting for "faster work," contracting for "good quality," and contracting for "less spending." This means that through investment contracts, the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is embodied in the basic construction management system. Therefore, the investment contract system is a system for basic construction units to contract and implement the general line.

Why can investment contracts produce such huge results? The most fundamental problem is that through the implementation of this new system, the production relations of basic construction are further improved, making it more adaptable to the needs of the development of productive forces. What are the main contents of this change in production relations? First of all, under the principle of unified leadership and planned economy, power is decentralized and responsibilities are decentralized. Power and responsibility should have been unified, but in the past, power was concentrated more on the top, so it often could not be adapted to local conditions or adapted to specific matters. After the decentralization of power, the responsibilities of the construction unit are increased, and the enthusiasm can also be brought into play. Investment contract is an economic accounting that has both the leadership of the Party and a broad mass base. There is both control - control of total investment, output, quality, and time - and flexible accounting, which fully conforms to the spirit of the general line and the working method of the mass line. Secondly, it unifies the leadership of the four aspects of construction, construction, design, and appropriation in construction work. From then on, the phenomenon of "one thing with multiple masters" and "four powers standing side by side" no longer exists, and the market for artificial disputes is greatly reduced or completely eliminated. In addition to the abolition of some other unreasonable rules and regulations, it clears the obstacles for the further development of productive forces. Thirdly, it creates conditions for thoroughly taking the mass line in basic construction management work. After the construction unit contracts, it implements layer-by-layer contracting, from the factory all the way to the workers in the work team, achieving "everyone has a task, everyone has measures." Undoubtedly, these practices have greatly improved the production relations within the construction unit and between the top and bottom and left and right, so the productive forces have developed rapidly. "Why is everyone so enthusiastic about investment contracts?" The reason is that the investment contract system is a concrete manifestation of the mass line in the basic construction management system. The implementation of this system makes it easy to mobilize all positive factors and provide the most wisdom and the greatest strength for socialist construction.

The investment contract system is fully adapted to the current situation of the Great Leap Forward, and it further closely combines the leadership of the Party with the enthusiasm of the masses. To do a good job in investment contracts, construction units must strengthen the leadership of the Party and thoroughly follow the mass line. Whether the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company can contract the second phase of the project together with the investment in the first phase of the project was not without doubts among many comrades at the beginning, and even individual comrades raised objections. However, under the leadership of the Party Committee, they mobilized the masses and carried out two months of great debate on investment contracts, broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and the masses put forward more than 2,000 saving items, reducing the investment per ton of steel by more than 60%. With the investment in the first phase of the project, not only can the first and second phases of the project be fully contracted, but also the steel output can be increased by more than 15% on the basis of doubling. Before the contract, the technical equipment level of many construction units had a tendency to deviate from the current reality of our country. After the contract, with the help of the masses, these abnormal phenomena began to be overcome.

The investment contract system was born not long ago, and there are not many units that implement this system. It is necessary for all regions, departments, and units to proceed from their own specific conditions, adapt to specific matters, adapt to local conditions, and gradually promote this system in combination with the technical innovation movement, so that the management work of basic construction in all aspects can be further improved, so that it can better serve the high-speed development of socialist construction. This is the purpose of implementing investment contracts. Obviously, investment contract is a bright red flag on the basic construction front. Wherever it is planted, the productive forces there will develop by leaps and bounds. All basic construction departments and units should plant this red flag.

### 基本建设投资要实行包干制

    基本建设投资要实行包干制
    在全国生产大跃进的形势下，冶金部在一部分建设单位中试行了投资包干制度。三个月的实践，成绩很好。开始实现了“投资一顶二，产量翻一番，速度快一倍”的战斗口号。由此可见，实行投资包干是革新基本建设管理制度的一项重大革命措施，也是进一步改进基本建设生产关系，促进生产力飞跃发展的一面红旗。最近，国务院总结了冶金部和其他方面实行投资包干的经验，发布了“关于改进基本建设财务管理制度的几项规定”，冶金部和财政部又在石景山钢铁厂召开了现场会议，要把这个经验推行到全国去。这样，就把投资包干这一面红旗更高地举起来了。
    投资包干制度就是保证在不降低生产能力、不推迟交工日期、不突破投资总额和不增加非生产建设比重的条件下，把基本建设投资交由建设部门和单位，统一掌握，自行安排，包干使用。也就是把一定数量的投资交给一个建设单位，要求他们在一定时间内，建成一定生产规模的厂矿，由建设单位“包打天下”。包得好的，投资少花了，国家不收回，由建设单位把节约下来的投资使用到扩大生产规模上去，谁的节约办法多，谁的建设规模就可以搞得越大，谁就在社会主义建设事业中作了更多贡献，这办法很受群众欢迎。冶金部把二点四亿元的建设投资包干给石景山钢铁厂使用，这个厂在设计部门的协助下，依靠群众的冲天干劲，建设规模由计划原产钢六十万吨扩大到一百三十万吨，建设时间由十年提前到三年就能建成。证明投资包干确是一个增产节约的好办法。
    由此可见，实行投资包干不仅仅能达到少花钱的目的，它的优越性是多方面的。从冶金系统已经实行投资包干的经验中看，他们实行的是“四包”制度，要包“多干”、包“快干”、包“质量好”、包“花钱少”。这就是说通过投资包干，把鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，在基本建设管理制度上具体化了。所以，投资包干制度，是基本建设单位包干贯彻总路线的制度。
    为什么投资包干能产生这样巨大的效果？最根本的问题是通过实行这种新制度，进一步改进了基本建设的生产关系，使它更适应于生产力发展的需要。这种生产关系改变的主要内容是什么？首先是在统一领导和计划经济的原则下，权力下放、责任下放。权力和责任本来应当统一，过去权力集中在上面多些，因而常常不能因地制宜，因事制宜。权力下放以后，建设单位的责任加重了，积极性也能发挥了。投资包干，是既有党的领导，又有广泛群众基础的经济核算。既有控制——投资总额、产量、质量、时间的控制，又有灵活的核算，这就完全符合总路线的精神和群众路线的工作方法。其次，统一了建设工作中建设、施工、设计、拨款等四个方面的领导，从此，“一事多主”、“四权并立”的现象不再存在了，人为纠纷的市场大大减少或者完全没有了。加上其它的一些不合理的规章制度的废除，就为进一步发展生产力扫除了障碍。再次，为在基本建设管理工作中彻底走群众路线创造了条件，建设单位包干后，实行层层包干，从厂一直包到作业小组中的工人，做到“个个有任务，人人有措施”。无疑的，这些做法都使建设单位内部和上下左右的生产关系得到大大改善，于是生产力就猛烈地向前发展起来了。“为什么大家对投资包干有这么大的积极性？”原因就在于：投资包干制度是群众路线在基建管理制度上的具体表现形式，实行这种制度就便于把一切积极因素都调动起来，为社会主义建设提供最多的智慧和最大的力量。
    投资包干制度是完全适应当前大跃进的形势的，它把党的领导和群众的积极性进一步密切结合起来。搞好投资包干，建设单位一定要加强党的领导，彻底地走群众路线。武汉钢铁公司能否以第一期工程的投资，把第二期工程也一起包下来，开始时在许多同志中不是没有疑问的，甚至个别同志曾提出反对的意见。但是，他们在党委领导下发动了群众，进行了两个月的投资包干的大争大辩，破除了迷信，解放了思想，群众提出了二千多个节约项目，使每吨钢的投资降低了60％多，用第一期工程的投资，不但能把一期二期工程全部包干，还可使钢产量在增加一倍的基础上，再增加15％以上。不少建设单位的技术装备水平，在包干前有脱离我国当前实际的倾向。包干后，在群众的帮助下，这些不正常现象开始得到克服。
    投资包干制度诞生不久，实行这种制度的单位还不多，需要各地区、各部门、各单位从自己的具体情况出发，因事、因地制宜，结合技术革新运动，逐步推广这种制度，使各个方面的基本建设的管理工作得到进一步改进，使它能更好地为高速度地发展社会主义建设事业服务，这就是实行投资包干的目的。很显然，投资包干是基本建设战线上的一面鲜明红旗，它插到那里，那里的生产力就会飞跃发展，各个基本建设部门和单位都应该插上这面红旗。
