Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 8th — The broad masses of workers in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are, with a spirit of fearless revolutionary heroism, actively overcoming the difficulties of insufficient supply of primary raw materials that have emerged since the great surge in industry by the whole Party and the entire people.

Guangxi has planned to build more than 340,000 large and small industrial projects this year, and as of June 24, more than 118,000 have been put into production. With the accelerated construction of a large number of factories and their gradual completion and commissioning, the demand for raw materials such as pig iron, steel, cement, and timber has greatly increased, and a state of tight supply has begun to appear. This is a normal situation in the rapid development of industry. Faced with this situation, the broad masses of workers are not passively waiting, retreating in the face of difficulties; but are instead, going all out, actively experimenting, boldly using substitutes, and practicing strict economy. Many difficulties have already been resolved, or reliable solutions have been found.

Currently, many places in the Autonomous Region are using indigenous methods to manufacture cement. Nanning, Yulin, Luzhai, Beiliu, Binyang, Baise, Yishan, and other places have successfully produced cement using indigenous methods, and some have already produced it on a large scale. The silicate cement and gypsum Roman cement recently successfully trial-produced by the Nanning Manufacturing Plant have been judged to have good performance after physical testing. Both types of cement can reach the 400-grade cement standard. This plant is actively preparing to build a cement plant with an annual output of 15,000 tons. The masses have great enthusiasm for manufacturing cement. Recently, various places sent more than 1,000 pieces of indigenous cement to the Materials Testing Institute of the Autonomous Region Basic Construction Engineering Bureau for physical performance testing.

The barrier of mystifying steelmaking has also been broken through. Now, seven factories in various places in the Autonomous Region have produced steel. The factories that have successfully produced steel can soon produce relatively large quantities. Indigenous iron smelting is also booming in various places. Du'an Yao Autonomous County alone has decided to build 15 indigenous iron smelting furnaces in the near future, with an annual output of 2,100 tons of iron, which can solve the county's shortage of iron for developing the new agricultural tool industry in the short term, and can also support some other counties.

Doing everything possible to boldly use substitutes is also one of the ways to solve the raw material difficulties. After hard work by the broad masses of workers, Guangxi has now successfully trial-produced many products that use wood to replace steel. Due to the increased use of wood, the Autonomous Region Basic Construction Bureau has also raised the issue of conserving wood, and decided to save 14,000 cubic meters of wood this year to support national industrial construction.

    用土办法  找代用品  节约材料
    广西工业困难迎刃而解
    据新华社南宁8日电  广西僮族自治区的广大职工群众正以无所畏惧的革命英雄气慨，积极战胜在全党全民大办工业以后开始出现的主要原材料供应不足的困难。
    广西今年规划兴办的大小工业项目共有三十四万多个，到6月24日止已投入生产的有一十一万八千多个。随着大批工厂加紧建设和逐渐建成投入生产，生铁、钢材、水泥和木材等原材料需要量大增，开始出现供应紧张状态。这是工业飞跃发展中出现的一种正常情况。广大职工群众在这种情势面前，不是消极等待，知难而退；而是鼓足干劲，积极试制，大胆利用代用品，厉行节约，许多困难已迎刃而解，或者已经找到解决的可靠途径。
    现在在自治区的许多地方，都在用土法制造水泥。南宁、玉林、鹿寨、北流、宾阳、百色、宜山等地都用土法自制水泥成功，有的已经大量生产了。南宁制造厂最近试制成功的矽酸盐水泥和石膏罗马水泥，经过物理试验，判明性能良好，两种水泥都可以达到四百号水泥标准。这个厂正在积极筹建一个年产一万五千吨的水泥厂。广大群众制造水泥的热情很高，最近各地送给自治区基本建设工程局材料试验所要求进行物理性能试验的土水泥，就有一千多件。
    炼钢神秘化这一关也被突破了。现在自治区各地已有七个工厂炼出了钢。目前已经炼钢成功的工厂，不久就可以比较大量地生产了。土法炼铁也在各地蓬勃展开。仅都安瑶族自治县就决定在最近兴建土炼铁炉十五座，年产二千一百吨铁，短期内就可以解决本县发展新式农具工业缺铁的困难，还可以支援外县一部分。
    尽一切可能大胆地利用代用品，也是解决原材料困难的途径之一。经过广大职工的刻苦钻研，现在广西已经试制成功许多用木材代替钢材的产品。由于木材用量增加，自治区基本建设局还提出了节约木材的问题，决定在今年节约一万四千立方公尺木材，来支援国家工业建设。
