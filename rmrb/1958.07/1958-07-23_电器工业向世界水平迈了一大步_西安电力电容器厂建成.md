Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 20th: China's first power capacitor factory, the Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory, officially began production yesterday.

The Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory is one of the key projects designed with the assistance of the Soviet Union. Its design incorporates the most advanced technological achievements in the Soviet capacitor manufacturing industry. The completion of this factory marks a major step forward for China's electrical industry towards the world's most advanced levels. In the past, China relied on imports to supply power capacitors, but from now on, they can be entirely produced domestically.

The Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory was built using a method of simultaneous construction, trial production, and production. With the assistance of Soviet experts, nineteen types of capacitors have already been successfully trial-produced before the official start of production. Among them are cosine capacitors used to improve the power factor of electrical equipment, impulse capacitors used for impulse high-voltage generators, communication capacitors used for high-frequency communication equipment in power transmission lines, and compensation capacitors used to reduce line power consumption.

    电器工业向世界水平迈了一大步
    西安电力电容器厂建成
    据新华社西安20日电  我国第一座电力电容器厂——西安电力电容器厂昨天正式投入生产。
    西安电力电容器厂是苏联帮助我国设计的重点工程之一。它的设计集中了苏联电容器制造工业上最先进的技术成就。这个工厂的建成，标志着我国电器工业向世界最先进水平迈进了一大步。我国过去依靠进口供应的电力电容器，今后完全可以由国内自己生产了。
    西安电力电容器厂是采取边施工、边试制、边生产的办法建设起来的。在苏联专家的帮助下，正式投入生产前已经试制成功十九种电容器。其中有用于提高电器设备功率因数的余弦电容器，有用于冲击高压发生器的冲击电容器，有用于电力输送线高频通讯设备的通讯电容器，也有减少线路电能消耗的补偿电容器等。
