Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 20th: U.S. President Eisenhower delivered a "morale-boosting" speech yesterday to the American troops invading Lebanon.

From White House Press Secretary Hagerty's explanation, it can be seen that Eisenhower hoped to answer, "in his own words and voice," the soldiers' questions: Why were they sent to this distant Middle Eastern country? The president appeared greatly disturbed after seeing news reports about the question raised by the U.S. Marines in Lebanon.

In his speech, Eisenhower tried to deceive the American soldiers with beautiful platitudes, saying that they went to Lebanon to "help Lebanon maintain its independence"; that they went "as friends" to "help the Lebanese people maintain their freedom"; that going to Lebanon to "fulfill their duty" was the "greatest contribution to world peace," and so on, attempting to conceal the criminal acts of trampling Lebanese territory, ravaging the Lebanese people, thereby threatening the independence and freedom of the people of other Middle Eastern countries, and undermining world peace.

Eisenhower said that the United States is "striving for greater efforts by the United Nations" in order to cover up the ferocious face of the United States with the signboard of the United Nations. But he admitted that this attempt has "not yet succeeded," and "we will persist in our efforts."

In his speech, the American president could not help but worry about his unfortunate soldiers: "While fulfilling your duties, you may encounter attacks from propaganda incited by cunning and ambitious people." He said: "This will be a difficult time for all of you. I know that." However, the problem is not what "propaganda attacks," the problem lies in the facts, and the facts are absolutely merciless for the American invaders.

The American president's "own voice" certainly cannot dispel the terrible fear and doubt in the minds of the invading soldiers. After giving a deceptive sermon, he could only offer them a cheap "God bless you!"

    美国士兵不知为什么侵黎
    美总统花言巧语唱迷魂曲
    据新华社20日讯  华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔昨天对侵略黎巴嫩的美国军队发表了一篇“振作士气”的讲话。
    从白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂的解释里可以看出，艾森豪威尔希望“用他自己的话和声音”来回答士兵们的问题：他们被派到这个遥远的中东的国家，究竟是为了什么？这位总统从新闻报道看到了在黎巴嫩的美国海军陆战队士兵们提出的这个问题后显得大为不安。
    艾森豪威尔在讲话中力图用一些美丽的滥调来欺骗美国士兵，说什么他们去黎巴嫩是为了“帮助黎巴嫩维持独立”啦；是“作为朋友”去“援助黎巴嫩人民保持自由”啦；到黎巴嫩“履行职责”是“对世界和平的最大贡献”啦，等等，企图借以掩盖践踏黎巴嫩国土、蹂躏黎巴嫩人民进而威胁其他中东国家人民的独立自由、破坏世界和平的罪恶行动。
    艾森豪威尔说，美国正在“争取联合国作更大的努力”，以便用联合国的招牌来遮盖美国的狰狞面目。但是他承认这种尝试到现在“还没有成功”，“我们将坚持努力”。
    这位美国总统在讲话里也禁不住替他的倒霉的士兵们担心：“在履行职责的时候，可能会遇到狡诈的和野心勃勃的人们煽动起来的宣传的攻击”。他说：“对你们大家来说这将是一段困难的时候。我是知道的。”但是，问题不在于什么“宣传攻击”，问题在于事实，而事实对于美国侵略者是绝对无情的。
    这位美国总统“自己的声音”当然也并不能驱走侵略士卒们头脑里可怕的恐惧和怀疑。他在作了一番欺骗的说教之后，只能奉送给他们一个廉价的“上帝保佑你们！”
