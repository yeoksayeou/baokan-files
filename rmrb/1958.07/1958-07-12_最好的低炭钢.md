    The Best Low Carbon Steel
    Based on the initial success of adopting the oxygen blowing rapid steelmaking method, the casting workshop of the Wuchang Shipyard consecutively conducted a fourth trial smelting, producing low carbon steel with a carbon content of 0.181%, catching up with the minimum carbon content of 0.2% for British carbon steel (steel grade EN2).

    The casting workshop began formal production of nineteen types of castings for new products on July 7th, including cup-shaped pipe sections, brackets, and levers. In the future, it will cast large-scale steel castings in large quantities, with an annual steel production of 7,000 tons. (Changjiang Daily)

    最好的低炭钢
    武昌造船厂铸工车间，在采用吹氧快速炼钢法初获成功的基础上，接连又进行了第四次试炼，炼出了低炭钢，含炭量0.181％，赶上了英国炭素钢（钢号EN2）最低含炭量0.2％。
    铸工车间在7月7日已开始正式生产新产品上的杯形管节、支架、杠杆等十九种铸件。今后将大量地浇铸大型的铸钢件，炼钢生产量每年达到七千吨。　（长江日报）
