My Suggestion

    Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone?
    Most of the employees participating in border construction are transferred from the interior, and their workplaces are far away from their hometowns. After a long time, they want to go home and see their families, but the road is too far and the travel expenses are high, and if this continues, there will be financial difficulties. I suggest moving their families to the border areas and having them participate in labor production in nearby rural areas as much as possible. This would not only reclaim wasteland but also take care of the family life of the employees. Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone? Mumin

    岂不一举两得
    参加边疆建设的职工，大多数是从内地调去的，工作地点与家乡距离很远。日子久了，想回家看看，可是路太远，花的路费多，要长此下去，生活上也会有困难。建议把他们的家属也迁到边疆去，尽可能到附近农村参加劳动生产。这样既开垦了荒地，又照顾了职工的家庭生活，岂不一举两得。　穆民
