"Sacred Fish" Caught

Huang Jiao Yuan, production team leader of the Qianfeng Fishery Production Cooperative in Aojiao Village, Huilai County, Guangdong Province, using his high-yield experimental boat, caught four pilot whales (also called "Wuji Baiji" or "sea pigs") on June 27th with a monofilament gillnet, weighing over 570 pounds in total.

This type of fish has high economic value. It tastes delicious, contains rich oils, and can be refined into high-quality lubricating oil, aircraft oil, etc. However, this fish has historically been considered a "sacred fish" in fishermen's legends. It was believed that if one of these fish got caught in the net, a large group would gather and capsize the boat. Therefore, fishermen used to avoid "sacred fish" upon sight. If they accidentally caught one, they dared not eat it. This time, the Qianfeng Cooperative caught the "sacred fish," but the fishing boat returned safely.

    “神鱼”落网
    广东惠来县澳角村前锋渔业生产合作社生产队长黄角元的高产试验船，在6月27日用胶丝浮莲网（流刺网）捕获乌鹅白鹅鱼（或称“乌忌白忌”或“海猪”）四条，共重五百七十多斤。
    这种鱼经济价值很高，味美可口，含有丰富油脂，可以提炼高贵的滑机油、飞机用油等。但是，这种鱼在渔民传说中历来认为是“神鱼”。如果一条鱼上了网它们就会集结一大群来把你的船翻沉。因此，渔民们过去一见“神鱼”就避开。偶然捕到，也不敢食。这次前锋社捕到“神鱼”，渔船却安全回航。
