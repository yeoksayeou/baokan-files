Xinhua News Agency dispatch: 200,000 working people of Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, including tens of thousands from West Berlin, held a grand rally on the afternoon of the 16th in Marx-Engels Square in the city center to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

When party leaders such as Ulbricht and Grotewohl, as well as delegations from fraternal parties, ascended the rostrum, they were warmly welcomed with thunderous applause and cheers. After the meeting was announced, Kusinen, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Dong Biwu, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of China, Faron, head of the delegation of the French Communist Party, and Ulbricht spoke at the meeting successively.

Kusinen said, "The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany proclaimed the truth of our era: 'Socialism will win. Socialism will triumph throughout Germany. Socialism is the future of all mankind.'" He said, "The Socialist Unity Party of Germany has proven that it has inherited the glorious tradition of the German working class and resolutely combated all attempts at revisionism. Such a party can be trusted forever."

In his speech, Dong Biwu said that the successfully concluded Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany was not only a major event for the German people, but also made new contributions to defending world peace and safeguarding the solidarity of the international communist movement. He expressed his firm belief that under the leadership of the glorious Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the German people will surely be able to smoothly achieve the goals set by this Party Congress. Dong Biwu said that the deep fraternal friendship established between the Chinese and German people in the just cause of accelerating socialist construction and safeguarding world peace will be further developed in the future, and cooperation between the two countries in various fields will be even closer. He emphasized that in the just struggle of the German people, they will continue to receive the full support of the 600 million Chinese people.

Dong Biwu spoke about the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, saying that it has severely struck the imperialist camp's colonial rule and war preparations plans in the Middle East, and is greatly beneficial to the anti-colonialist struggle of the people of the Middle East. He said that the imperialists will continue to use the threat of war to blackmail the people of the world, but the people are fully capable of defeating the imperialists' belligerent policies.

Dong Biwu continued, the imperialists also vainly attempt to undermine and weaken socialist countries from within and to split the world communist movement. The thoroughly revisionist program adopted by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is precisely the product of this policy of imperialism, especially American imperialism. In order to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and to consolidate the solidarity of the international communist movement and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, we must wage a thorough struggle against Yugoslav modern revisionism. He said that the Marxist-Leninist parties will inevitably achieve brilliant development after crushing modern revisionism, as evidenced by the successful conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

In his speech, Faron emphasized that today the winds of socialism and freedom have swept across the globe, and we will lead our struggle for national happiness, democracy, and peace to victory, stop fascism, and let peace triumph in France.

In his speech, Ulbricht briefly elaborated on the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to the people of Berlin. He said that the Congress decided that in 1,002 days, and in the shortest period in history, to increase production and make the consumption of residents of the German Democratic Republic per capita catch up with and surpass that of West Germany. He said that we will prove to the world the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over West German militarism—clerical rule.

    庆祝德国党代表大会胜利闭幕
    柏林二十万群众盛大集会
    董必武说：中国人民坚决支持德国人民正义斗争
    据新华社讯　民主德国首都柏林市二十万劳动人民、其中包括上万来自西柏林的人16日下午在市中心的马克思—恩格斯广场举行盛大集会，庆祝德国统一社会党第五次代表大会胜利闭幕。
    当乌布利希、格罗提渥等党的领导人和各兄弟党代表团登上主席台时，人们以雷动的鼓掌和欢呼热烈欢迎他们。在宣布开会后，苏联共产党代表团团长库西宁、中国共产党代表团团长董必武、法国共产党代表团团长法戎和乌布利希先后在大会上讲了话。
    库西宁说，“在德国统一社会党第五次代表大会上宣告了我们时代的真理：‘社会主义必胜。社会主义将在全德国取得胜利。社会主义是全人类的未来。’”他说，“德国统一社会党已证明它自己继承了德国工人阶级的光荣传统，并坚决地打击了一切修正主义的企图。这样的一个党是可以永远信赖的。”
    董必武在讲话中说，已胜利闭幕的德国统一社会党第五次代表大会不仅是德国人民的一件大事，而且对于保卫世界和平、保卫国际共产主义运动的团结都作出了新的贡献。他表示深信德国人民在光荣的德国统一社会党的领导下一定能够顺利地实现这次党代表大会所规定的目标。董必武说，中德两国人民在加速建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的正义事业中所建立起来的深厚的兄弟友谊今后将会得到进一步的发展，两国在各方面的合作将会更加紧密。他强调说，在德国人民的正义斗争中定会继续得到六亿中国人民的全力支援。
    董必武谈到了伊拉克共和国政府的成立，他说，这严重地打击了帝国主义阵营在中近东的殖民统治和备战计划，大大有利于中近东人民反殖民主义的斗争。他说，帝国主义者还会用战争威胁来讹诈世界人民，但是人民完全有力量打败帝国主义的好战政策。
    董必武接着说，帝国主义者还妄想从内部来破坏和削弱社会主义国家，来分化世界共产主义运动。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会所通过的彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领正是帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义这种政策的产物。为了保卫马列主义的纯洁性、为了巩固国际共产主义运动和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，我们必须同南斯拉夫现代修正主义进行彻底的斗争。他说，马列主义的党在粉碎现代修正主义后必然获得光辉的发展，这从德国统一社会党第五次代表大会的圆满成功得到了证明。
    法戎在讲话中强调说，今天社会主义和自由的风已经吹遍了地球，我们将把我们的争取民族幸福、民主和和平的斗争导向胜利，制止法西斯主义并且让和平在法国取得胜利。
    乌布利希在讲话中向柏林市人民扼要地阐述了德国统一社会党第五次代表大会的决议。他说，代表大会决定在一千零两天之后，而在历史上最短的期间提高生产、使德意志民主共和国居民按人口计算的消费量赶上和超过西德。他说，我们将向全世界证明社会主义制度对西德军国主义——教会统治的无比优越性。
