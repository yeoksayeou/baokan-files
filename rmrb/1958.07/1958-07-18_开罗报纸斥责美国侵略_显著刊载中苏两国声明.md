Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 17th. All Arabic newspapers today carried the Soviet Union's warning to the United States to withdraw its troops from Lebanon with cross-page headlines, as well as Nasser's statement announcing that the United Arab Republic would treat any attack on Iraq as an attack on itself.

All newspapers also carried news about the Chinese government's warning to the United States and the recognition of the Republic of Iraq by China and the Soviet Union.

Newspapers continue to publish editorials condemning the United States for sending troops to Lebanon and carrying out armed intervention.

The "People's News" said that the United States is the "number one enemy of the people." The newspaper pointed out that by sending troops to Lebanon, "the United States today exposed itself as the chief culprit of imperialism in the world."

The "People's News" said that Lebanese Speaker of Parliament Oseiran had protested against the US dispatch of troops to Lebanon. The newspaper questioned how the United States could continue to shamelessly occupy Lebanon against the wishes of the Lebanese people. The newspaper pointed out that the saying "to protect a country by occupying its territory" does not make sense.

The "Al-Ahram" warned the United States that it should know: the awakened Middle East "will not succumb to its rule; even if it launches an atomic war, the Middle East will not accept its views or doctrines. No matter whether the United States sends the Sixth Fleet or its entire air force, it will never make it comply with the Eisenhower Doctrine again."

The "Republic News" said that the United States will eventually suffer a shameful defeat. The newspaper said that the United Nations Charter stipulates that sanctions should be imposed on those who launch aggression, and the United States' occupation of Lebanon is definitely a crime of aggression.

The "Al-Akhbar" pointed out that world public opinion is condemning US aggression. The newspaper said that the situation is developing rapidly, and all peaceful forces are mobilizing. With each passing hour, the United States' guilt is increasing, and its ugly face is being exposed to the world.

The "Evening News" on the 16th revealed that the United States' armed intervention in Lebanon was to suppress Arab nationalism. The newspaper said that the US dispatch of troops to Lebanon was "a blatant and unreasonable aggression against an independent country." The newspaper said that the United Nations should stop the United States' aggression against Lebanon and other Arab countries.

    开罗报纸斥责美国侵略
    显著刊载中苏两国声明
    新华社开罗17日电　所有阿拉伯文报纸今天都以横贯全页的大标题刊载了苏联警告美国要把军队撤出黎巴嫩的声明，以及纳赛尔宣布阿拉伯联合共和国将把对伊拉克的进攻作为对它本国的进攻的声明。
    所有报纸也都刊载了关于中国政府警告美国的消息以及中国和苏联承认伊拉克共和国的消息。
    各报继续发表社论斥责美国出兵黎巴嫩进行武装干涉。
    “人民报”说，美国是“人民的头号敌人”。这家报纸指出，由于出兵黎巴嫩，“美国今天暴露出它是全世界的帝国主义国家的首恶”。
    “人民报”说，黎巴嫩议长奥塞兰已经对美国出兵黎巴嫩提出了抗议。报纸质问说，美国怎么能够继续无耻地违反黎巴嫩人民的愿望占领黎巴嫩？报纸指出，“为了保护一个国家而去占领它的领土”这种说法是讲不通的。
    “金字塔报”警告美国说，它应该知道：觉醒了的中东“不会屈服于它的统治；即使它发动原子战争，中东也不会接受它的观点或主义。不管美国出动第六舰队或者它的全部空军都再也不会使得它遵从艾森豪威尔主义”。
    “共和国报”说，美国最终必定遭到可耻的失败。这家报纸说，联合国宪章规定要制裁发动侵略的，而美国侵占黎巴嫩，肯定地犯了侵略的罪行。
    “消息报”指出，世界舆论都在谴责美国侵略。这家报纸说，事态正在迅速发展，所有和平力量正在动员起来，随着每一个小时过去，美国的罪责都在加重，美国的丑恶面目正在暴露在全世界的面前。
    “晚报”16日揭露，美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的行动是为了打击阿拉伯民族主义。报纸说，美国出兵黎巴嫩是“对一个独立国家悍然进行无理的侵略”。报纸说，联合国应该制止美国对黎巴嫩和其他阿拉伯国家的侵略。
