The ingenious "Crystals"
    Not long ago, Ma Jilin, Li Xinglan, and three other young people at the Shanghai Institute of Silicate, Ministry of Light Industry, jointly succeeded in trial-producing a special material called "Crystalline Glass." This glass is harder than steel, lighter than aluminum, and can be widely used to replace steel in the manufacture of various cutting tools, bearings, and other products. They conducted two interesting experiments: once they heated the crystalline glass to over 800 degrees Celsius and then suddenly put it in cold water, the glass did not break or crack; once they used it to scratch the surface of a steel knife, and a scratch mark appeared on the knife surface, while using a steel knife to scratch the glass did no damage whatsoever.
    These five young people consist of two technicians, two assistant technicians, and one skilled worker. The oldest is only twenty-four years old, and the longest time they have been working is only three and a half years. Last year, they saw several American professional technical magazines boasting that the crystalline glass successfully researched and developed in the United States was "unique and unparalleled" in the world. At that time, these young people were eager to try, but the American magazines were silent on how to manufacture it. Some senior engineers in the institute also believed that it would be difficult to trial-produce it without any physical data or equipment conditions. With this said, it had to be temporarily abandoned. Recently, under the brilliant light of the General Line, their daring and capable thinking greatly increased, and they were determined to conquer this fortress. They saw that the people in the United States who made crystalline glass specialized in the study of photosensitive glass, and they guessed that the two types of glass must have an internal connection, and their institute had already successfully researched and developed photosensitive glass, which provided the conditions for further exploration. Later, they also received help from some Soviet materials, and as a result, they preliminarily succeeded in only thirty-six hours. After inspection by the institute and Tongji University, it was proved that its hardness reached level 7 on the Mohs scale (high carbon steel is level 6.5 to 7).
    Now, they are further improving the performance of this glass and studying its actual range of use.
    "Let the Americans catch up with us!"
    In the past, only Switzerland and the United States could make sintered aluminum. In May of this year, Jin Dakang, an assistant researcher at the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, successfully trial-produced a new aircraft structural material with good performance – sintered aluminum.
    Sintered aluminum retains the outstanding advantage of aluminum's light weight, and because it has an extremely thin layer of aluminum oxide on its surface that cannot be seen even with a high-powered microscope, it has higher mechanical strength and heat resistance than ordinary aluminum.
    At first, these young researchers could not believe their achievements and even suspected that there was something wrong with the material testing machine. Later, they used three standard metal materials to calibrate the machine and found that the machine was completely accurate. In fact, the problem lay in their own thinking that had not broken free from blindly believing in foreign countries. In the recent Great Leap Forward, the young researchers further eliminated the thinking of blindly believing in foreign countries and belittling themselves, and re-trial-produced sintered aluminum. After four days and nights of hard work, they achieved good results.
    At the Youth Great Leap Forward Conference of the Shanghai District Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Jin Dakang put forward passionate bold words: We can certainly do what foreigners can do, and we must surpass them. We must leave the United States behind and let the United States catch up with us!

    青年人的大胆创造
    聪明的“结晶”
    不久以前，轻工业部上海矽酸盐研究所的马继麟、李兴兰等五个青年人，合力试制成功了一种特殊材料——“结晶玻璃”。这种玻璃比钢还硬，比铝还轻，可以广泛用来代替钢铁制造各种切削工具、轴承等产品。他们做了两次有趣的试验：一次把结晶玻璃加热到摄氏八百多度，再一下子放在冷水里，玻璃竟不破不裂；一次用它划钢刀的表面，刀面上就被划出条痕，而用钢刀划玻璃，玻璃表面丝毫不损。
    这五个青年人，两个是技术员，两个是助理技术员，一个是技工，年纪最大的只有二十四岁，参加工作时间最长的也只有三年半。去年，他们看到美国几本专业技术杂志上大吹大擂，说美国研究成功的结晶玻璃是世界上“独创无二”的。当时，这几个青年人就跃跃欲试，可是怎样制造，美国杂志却缄口不谈。所里一些高级工程师也认为，一无实物资料，二无设备条件，要试制有困难。这一说，也只得暂作罢论。最近，他们在总路线的光辉照耀下，敢想敢做的思想大大抬头，决心攻下这个堡垒。他们看到美国制成结晶玻璃的人是专门研究感光玻璃的，就猜想这两种玻璃一定有内在联系，而感光玻璃他们研究所已研究成功，有条件作进一步探讨。后来，他们又得到苏联一些资料的帮助，结果只花了三十六个小时就初步研究成功。经研究所和同济大学的检定，证明它的硬度达到了摩氏七级（高炭钢为六点五级到七级）。
    现在，他们又在进一步提高这种玻璃的性能，并且研究它的实际使用范围。
    “要让美国来赶我们！”
    过去只有瑞士和美国会做烧结铝。今年5月，中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所助理研究员金大康等，试制成功一种新的性能良好的飞机结构材料——烧结铝。
    烧结铝保持了铝的分量轻这个突出的优点，而且，由于它表面上有一层极薄的用高倍显微镜也看不出的氧化铝，所以具有比普通铝更高的机械强度和耐热性能。
    开始，这几位青年研究人员不敢相信自己的成绩，甚至怀疑材料试验机是否有毛病。后来，他们用三种标准金属材料来校正机器，发现机器完全正确。其实，毛病是出在他们自己迷信外国的思想还没有打破。在最近的大跃进中，青年研究人员们进一步破除了迷信外国和妄自菲薄的思想，重新试制烧结铝，经过四昼夜的苦干，获得了良好的结果。
    在中国科学院上海区研究所青年跃进大会上，金大康提出了热情的豪语：外国人能做的我们一定也能做，而且要超过他们，我们一定要把美国抛在后面，让美国来赶我们！
