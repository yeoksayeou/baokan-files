Neighborhood Residents Running Commission Shops
— A New Form of Commercial Organization
Lin Yi

    Not long ago, I had the opportunity to visit several commission shops run by neighborhood residents in the Hebei District of Tianjin. These shops generally have only one storefront, located in a relatively central place in the neighborhood. They carry about a hundred types of goods, divided into the following categories: small, scattered non-staple foods for residents' daily needs, such as oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, cigarettes, alcohol, seasonings, and eggs; small daily necessities for residents' daily needs, such as needles, thread, soap, toothbrushes, and toothpaste; school supplies for elementary school students, and household medicines like Rendan, Ten Drops Water, and headache powder. These shops don't require much capital for goods; the small ones only need a little over a hundred yuan, and the large ones only two or three hundred yuan. These commission shops are very convenient for nearby residents. They don't have to travel far to buy things worth a few cents or a dime, and they can buy things without leaving the neighborhood. Most of the people who come here to buy things are elderly women, housewives, and children. These commission shops mainly serve them.
    The commission shops are led by the neighborhood committees. The staff of the commission shops are also selected by the neighborhood committees and approved by the residents' representatives after discussion. The Shanlinli commission shop that I visited, including the agency for People's Bank savings business, had a total of four staff members. Both the commission shop and the bank agency were located in the home of the director of the neighborhood committee. The director of the neighborhood committee is a 62-year-old retired cadre. He is the person in charge of the commission shop and the bank agency. There are only three people in his family. Besides him, his eldest son works in the Finance and Trade Department of the District Committee, and his youngest son studies at Tianjin University. The other three staff members are a 67-year-old elderly person, a recuperating cadre suffering from arthritis, who both work in the store all day, and a staff member's family member in their forties with a small family who can spare most of their time to help in the store. The goods for the commission shop are supplied by nearby state-owned retail stores. The selling price is the same as that of the state-owned stores. The daily proceeds are returned to the state-owned stores. After the goods are sold out, they can be picked up from the state-owned stores at any time. The goods are inventoried once a month and reconciled with the state-owned stores. The commission shop does not need to establish account books at all, and the procedure for picking up goods is also very simple. The method of living treatment for the staff of the commission shop has not yet been determined. According to the opinions of individual comrades from the District Committee and the Municipal Committee, they do not intend to adopt the commission fee method, but tend to pay a living allowance of approximately ten yuan per person per month, which will be paid by the state-owned stores and the People's Bank and handed over to the neighborhood committee for appropriate distribution according to the labor situation and family living conditions of the store staff. In conversations with the staff, they all emphasized running the commission shop well and serving the nearby residents, completely disregarding remuneration. In this era of the Great Leap Forward, everyone considers it an honor to be able to contribute their share of strength to the country's socialist construction.
    Based on what we have seen, we believe that neighborhood residents running commission shops is a socialist form of commercial organization worth promoting. This kind of commission shop is entirely socialist in nature. The goods are state-owned, the selling price is stipulated by the state, and the commercial profit belongs to the state. At the same time, this kind of commission shop is also one of the forms of "relying on the masses to run commerce well." The shop is under the leadership of the neighborhood committee, serves the local residents, and is supervised by the local residents. The staff of the shop are elected by the local residents. This form of commercial organization can be adopted more widely in the small stores at the grassroots level that are closest to the masses. It can replace small merchants' family shops and fixed and mobile stalls in a fairly large range. It has the advantage of small merchants in facilitating the masses and has close ties with the masses, but unlike small merchants, it does not have the characteristics of small private owners and the spontaneous tendency to develop capitalism. The operating purpose of small merchants is to make money, while the operating purpose of this kind of commission shop is to facilitate the masses and serve the masses. It is completely different in nature from small merchants. Some comrades suspect whether this kind of commission shop will become a new small merchant? We believe that as long as we adhere to the complete socialist ownership of this type of commission shop, as long as we follow the mass line in organization, strengthen leadership, and carefully select staff, it is generally impossible to degenerate into a small merchant. Of course, individual acts of corruption and theft may still occur, but this is a matter of relying on the Party and relying on the masses to strengthen management and carry out education, just as individual acts of corruption and theft still exist in state-owned stores. After this kind of commission shop is universally established, the original small merchants engaged in these industries can switch to production labor. At that time, residents will not feel inconvenienced because small merchants have changed careers. On the contrary, because there are many commission shops and the staff's political awareness is generally higher than that of small merchants, residents will feel more convenient. Developing commission shops for neighborhood residents will help us further solve the problem of the socialist transformation of self-financing small merchants. In addition, from the perspective of the use of urban labor, taking this approach can use a considerable number of semi-laborers in commercial operations and free up a considerable portion of small merchants (most of whom are full laborers) to engage in production labor; from the perspective of commercial operations, the operating costs of commission shops may be more economical than those of small merchants, which is both economical and reasonable.
    Neighborhood residents running commission shops is a direction that should be developed. However, according to Tianjin's preliminary experience, this form of commercial organization itself also has certain limitations. First of all, in terms of industry, some commodities that are too bulky (such as coal), some commodities that have too much choice and are not needed by residents every day (such as most knitwear and large department stores), and some fresh and perishable commodities (such as meat and fish) are not suitable for this method of operation. Secondly, in terms of store scale, it is generally more suitable for becoming a small store that is closest to the residents and can more widely replace small merchants' family stores and peddlers, but generally cannot replace state-owned stores that operate a wider variety of goods and have more complex business situations. Of course, because this form of commercial organization is only just beginning to be piloted and there is not much experience yet, the above opinions are only preliminary ideas and need to be further summarized and studied.

    里弄居民办代销商店
    ——一种新的商业组织形式
    林义
    不久以前，我在天津市河北区有机会参观了几家里弄居民办的代销商店。这种商店一般只有一间门面，设置在里弄比较适中的地方，经营的商品大约有一百多种，分成以下几类：居民日常需要的零星副食品，如油、盐、酱、醋、烟、酒、调料、鸡蛋等；居民日常需要的小百货，如针、线、肥皂、牙刷、牙膏等；小学生用的文化用品和人丹、十滴水、头痛粉一类的家用药品。商店占用的商品资金不多，小的只有一百多元，大的也只有两、三百元。这类代销商店对附近居民十分方便，他们可以不必为购买几分钱、一两角钱的东西走远路，不出里弄就可以买到东西。到这里来买东西的，多半是老太太、家庭主妇和小孩子，这类代销店主要是为他们服务的。
    代销店是由居民委员会领导的，代销店的工作人员，也是由居民委员会挑选并经过居民代表讨论同意的。我参观过的善邻里代销店，连同代办人民银行储蓄业务在内，一共有四个工作人员。代销店和银行代办所都设在居民委员会主任家里。居民委员会主任是一位六十二岁的退休干部，他是代销店和银行代办所的负责人，他家里一共只有三口人，除了他以外，大儿子在区委财贸部工作，小儿子在天津大学读书。其他三个工作人员，一个是六十七岁的老年人，一个是患关节炎的休养干部，他们都整天在店内工作，一个是家庭人口简单的四十多岁的职工家属，可以抽出大部分时间到店内来帮忙。代销店的商品是由附近的国营零售商店供给的，销售价格同国营商店相同，每天收回的货款交回国营商店，商品销完了以后，随时到国营商店取货，每月盘点一次商品，和国营商店对账，代销店完全不必建立账簿，取货的手续也很简便。代销店工作人员的生活待遇办法，现在还没有确定，据区委和市委个别同志的意见，他们不打算采取代销手续费的办法，倾向于大体上按照每人每月十元的标准，由国营商店和人民银行付给生活补助费，交给居民委员会按照商店工作人员的劳动情况和家庭生活状况，适当分配。在同工作人员谈话时，他们都强调办好代销店，为附近的居民服务，完全不计较报酬，在这个大跃进的时代里，每个人都以能够为国家的社会主义建设事业贡献自己的一分力量为光荣。
    根据看到的情况，我们认为里弄居民办代销商店是一种值得提倡的社会主义的商业组织形式。这种代销商店完全是社会主义性质的商业，商品是国有的，售价是由国家规定的，商业利润是归于国家的。同时，这种代销商店又是“依靠群众办好商业”的形式之一，商店归居民委员会领导，为当地居民服务，受当地居民监督，商店的工作人员由当地居民推选。这种商业组织形式可以在和群众最接近的基层小商店中较为普遍地采用。它可以在相当大的范围内代替小商人的夫妻店和固定、流动摊贩，他具有小商贩便利群众的优点，与群众有密切联系，但是不像小商贩那样具有小私有者的特性和发展资本主义的自发倾向，小商贩的经营目的是为了赚钱，而这种代销店的经营目的则是为了便利群众，服务群众，它和小商贩在性质上是完全不同的。有的同志怀疑，这种代销店会不会变成新的小商贩？我们认为：只要坚持这类代销店的完全的社会主义所有制，只要在组织上走群众路线，加强领导，慎重地挑选工作人员，一般地不可能蜕化成为小商贩。当然，个别的贪污盗窃行为还是可能发生的，但这是一个依靠党、依靠群众来加强管理和进行教育的问题，正如目前在国营商店中也还存在着个别的贪污、盗窃行为一样。在这种代销店普遍地建立起来以后，从事这些行业的原有的小商贩就可以转业，从事生产劳动，那时居民将不会因为小商贩转业而感到不便，相反地，由于代销店的点很多，工作人员的政治觉悟一般比小商贩高，居民会感到更加方便。发展里弄居民的代销商店，将有助于我们进一步解决自负盈亏的小商贩的社会主义改造问题。此外，从城市的劳动力使用方面来看，采取这种办法，可以把相当数量的半劳动力用于商业经营方面，腾出相当大一部分的小商贩（其中大部分是全劳动力）从事生产劳动；从商业经营方面来看，代销店的经营费用，可能比小商贩更加节省，这都是经济而合理的。
    里弄居民办代销商店是一个应当发展的方向。但是，根据天津的初步经验，这种商业组织形式本身也具有一定的局限性。首先，在行业方面，有些过于笨重的商品（如煤炭），有些选择性过大而又不为居民每天所需要的商品（如多数针织品、大百货），有些易于腐烂的鲜活商品（如肉、鱼），都不大适合于采取这种方式经营。其次，在商店规模方面，它一般比较适合于成为与居民接近最多的小商店，可以较广泛地代替小商人的夫妻店和小贩，而一般地不能代替经营商品品种较多，业务情况比较复杂的国营商店。当然，由于这种商业组织形式还只在开始试办，经验还不多，以上这些意见都还只是初步的设想，还有待于进一步总结经验，加以研究。
