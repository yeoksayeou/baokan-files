    Accumulate More Natural Green Manure During the Rainy Season
    Every rainy season, the fields, barren hills, farmlands, roadsides, riverbanks, pond edges, and cemetery grounds are full of natural green manure such as weeds and shrubs. Some areas have a habit of extensively utilizing natural green manure, but many other areas do not pay enough attention to this source of fertilizer. This is a problem that deserves everyone's attention.
    Although natural green manure is not as effective as cultivated leguminous green manure, weeds and shrubs generally contain the three major elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers. At the same time, natural green manure also has the same effects of increasing soil microbial activity, increasing soil humus, improving soil structure, and improving soil alkalinity.
    In terms of quantity, there is also a lot of natural green manure. Weeds and shrubs grow vigorously during the rainy season, and if attention is paid to regeneration during harvesting, they can be harvested several times a month. In areas with the most growth, each able-bodied person can harvest more than 10,000 catties a day, which, when mixed with soil and water, can be composted into 20,000 to 30,000 catties of high-quality compost.
    In the Great Leap Forward of agricultural production, fertilizer is a major asset for us to strive for a bumper harvest of grain, cotton, and oil crops. Why don't we make good use of these abundant natural green manure resources? Zhang Jiajun

### 要在雨季多积天然绿肥

    要在雨季多积天然绿肥
    每逢雨季，原野、荒山、田间、道旁、河岸、塘边、坟园等地，到处是杂草、灌木等天然绿肥。有些地区有大量利用天然绿肥的习惯，但是还有不少地区不重视这项肥源。这是一个值得引起大家注意的问题。
    天然绿肥，虽然不及栽培豆科等绿肥的肥效高，但杂草、灌木一般都含有氮、磷、钾肥料的三大要素。同时天然绿肥也同样具有增加土壤微生物活动、增加土壤腐植质、改良土壤结构、改良土壤碱性等功效。
    从数量上说，天然绿肥也是很多的。杂草、灌木在雨季生长旺盛，如果收割时注意再生长，一个月便可收割数次。在生长最多地区，每个全劳力一天可收割一万多斤，加土加水，就可沤成两三万斤质量较高的堆肥。
    在农业生产大跃进中，肥料是我们争取粮、棉、油料丰收的一大本钱。这些丰富的天然绿肥，我们为什么不很好利用呢？　　张家俊
