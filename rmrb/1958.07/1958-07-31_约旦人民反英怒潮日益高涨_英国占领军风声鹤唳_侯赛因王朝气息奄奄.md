Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 30th: A group of diplomatic officials from the United Arab Republic stationed in Jordan, who arrived in Alexandria on the 29th, said that since the British invading forces landed in Jordan, the entire country has been filled with indignation. They left Jordan after the United Arab Republic and Jordan severed diplomatic relations.

These diplomatic officials said that British troops are everywhere on the streets of Amman. Jordanian King Hussein, although living under the protection of the occupying forces, is still under the shadow of anxiety and fear.

They said that the Jordanian people were overjoyed when they heard the news of the Iraqi revolution.

These diplomatic officials included the former chargé d'affaires of the United Arab Republic Embassy in Amman. They said that Jordan's economic situation has deteriorated severely, and the country is suffering from a severe shortage of oil.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th: London News: The British "Times" published a dispatch from its Middle East correspondent on the 25th entitled "Jordan's Suppressed Discontent; Current Regime Lacks Public Support." This dispatch acknowledged that the Jordanian Hussein dynasty, supported by the bayonets of the British invading forces, and the British invading forces themselves, are facing increasingly strong opposition from the Jordanian people, especially among the Palestinians who constitute two-thirds of the population. Their political argument begins and often ends with the view that the British are responsible for the division of their homeland through the establishment of the hated Israel."

The reporter admitted that even among those who he believes are increasingly fewer in number who support Hussein, it "does not mean they welcome the presence of British troops in Jordan." Especially "among the lower-ranking officers, the enthusiasm seems to be much less." The reporter said that although "so many potential opposition leaders are now imprisoned," the Jordanian people's discontent can still be expressed. He said, "Amman heard five explosions earlier this week, ... more than in the entire first half of this year. There was an attempt to organize a strike last week to oppose the arrival of British troops. ... In Nablus on the West Bank, more than twenty people were arrested last week after a small demonstration in support of the Iraqi coup, and a series of arrests have also been carried out in Amman this week, including some army officers and two former government officials."

The reporter admitted that facing the increasingly strong opposition from the Jordanian people, the British invading forces are in a state of panic and unease. He said that British soldiers in Amman now dare to go out only in groups of four and carrying weapons. However, despite this, it cannot be guaranteed for long that "conspiracies" will not occur.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th: London News: British Labor Party MP Crossman published an article in his column in the "Daily Mirror" on the 29th, advocating the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan.

He wrote: "Twelve days after the (British) paratroopers made a sensational landing, they are still staying in tents around the airport, with nothing to do except dig deeper trenches and complain about the unbearable heat.

"In fact, the only reason to continue to keep them in Jordan is that they are a symbol of British support for King Hussein.

"If this symbol is removed, Hussein is likely to suffer the same fate as his cousin, Faisal of Iraq, within twenty-four hours."

Crossman concluded sarcastically that the "British paratroopers should be withdrawn (from Jordan) and brought back home - along with Hussein."

    约旦人民反英怒潮日益高涨
    英国占领军风声鹤唳　侯赛因王朝气息奄奄
    新华社开罗30日电　29日到达亚历山大港的一批阿拉伯联合共和国驻约旦的外交官员说，英国侵略军在约旦登陆以后，约旦全国充满了愤慨的情绪。他们是在阿拉伯联合共和国和约旦断绝外交关系后离开约旦的。
    这些外交官员说，安曼街道上到处都是英国军队。约旦国王侯赛因虽然在占领军的保护下过日子，但是仍然处在忧惧的阴影下。
    他们说，约旦人民在听到伊拉克革命的消息的时候简直欢喜若狂。
    这些外交官员中包括前阿拉伯联合共和国驻安曼大使馆代办。他们说，约旦的经济情况已经严重恶化，这个国家严重缺乏石油。
    据新华社30日讯　伦敦消息：英国“泰晤士报”25日以“约旦被压制下去的不满情绪，目前的政权缺乏公众的支持”为题，刊载该报驻中东记者的一篇电讯。这篇电讯承认，靠英国侵略军刺刀尖支持的约旦侯赛因王朝以及英国侵略军本身，正在受到约旦全国人民越来越强烈的反对。特别是在构成人口三分之二的那些巴勒斯坦人中间。他们的政治论点始于并且往往也是终于这种看法：英国人要对通过建立令人痛恨的以色列而使他们的祖国分治的这种情况负责。”
    这个记者承认，即使在他认为的越来越少的支持侯赛因的人中间，也“并不意味着他们欢迎英国军队驻扎在约旦”。特别是“在下级军官之间，看来热情要少得多”。这个记者说，尽管“现在有这么多可能的反对派领袖被监禁”，约旦人民的不满情绪仍然还能表现出来。他说，“本星期初安曼听到了五次爆炸，……次数比今年整个上半年还多。有人曾经企图在上星期组织一次罢工来反对英国军队的来临。……在约旦河西岸的纳布鲁斯，上星期有二十多人在一次为支持伊拉克政变而举行的小规模示威以后被捕，而本星期在安曼也进行了一连串的逮捕，被捕的人中包括一些陆军军官和两名前政府官员。”
    记者承认，面对着约旦人民越来越强烈的反对，英国侵略军正处在风声鹤唳，惊惶不安的状态。他说，现在安曼的英国士兵要四个人一组并且携带武器才敢外出。但是，尽管如此，也不能很长久地保证不会发生“阴谋”。
    据新华社30日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党议员克罗斯曼29日在“每日镜报”的专栏中发表文章，主张把英国军队从约旦撤出来。
    他写道：“在（英国）伞兵轰动一时地降临十二天之后，他们仍呆在机场四周的帐篷里，除了挖深战壕和抱怨天气炎热不能忍受之外，没有什么事情可作。
    “事实上，继续要他们驻在约旦的唯一理由是：他们是英国支持侯赛因国王的象征。
      “如果这个象征取消了，侯赛因很可能在二十四小时以内遭到他的堂兄、伊拉克的费萨尔同样的命运。”
    克罗斯曼最后用讽刺的口吻说，应当把“英国伞兵（从约旦）撤回国来——而且带着侯赛因回来”。
