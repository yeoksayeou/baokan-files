    The Growing Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    In order to inherit and promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and cultivate a large number of senior TCM practitioners who master the basic theories and medical techniques of TCM and possess basic knowledge of modern medicine, four colleges of traditional Chinese medicine were established simultaneously across the country in the autumn of 1956. Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine is one of them.
    Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine currently has a medical specialty, focusing on the study of traditional Chinese medicine, supplemented by basic courses in modern medicine. In terms of TCM theory courses, students will study the four classic works, *Medical Canon Selections*, *Materia Medica*, *Treatise on Cold Damage*, and *Synopsis of the Golden Chamber*, as well as fourteen TCM courses including internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, acupuncture, and prescriptions. Basic Western medicine courses include eleven courses such as physiology, anatomy, histology, biochemistry, pharmacology, microbiology, and pathology. In addition, there are general basic courses such as politics, language, biology, physics, chemistry, Russian, and Japanese. After completing the above thirty courses in the first five years, students will go to affiliated hospitals for graduation internships in the final year. After the above six years of systematic training, students will have TCM academic theory, master TCM medical techniques, and be able to independently undertake the medical treatment of general diseases.
    Currently, this TCM college has more than eighty teachers. Well-known TCM doctors such as Yu Daoji, Ren Yingqiu, Chen Shenwu, Shan Yutang, and Fang Mingqian are working at the school as teaching instructors or conducting scientific research. Most of the teachers for basic Western medicine courses are supported by Shenyang Medical College. Over the past two years, teachers have made great achievements in collective lesson preparation and self-compilation of teaching materials, and the quality of teaching has improved significantly. The scientific research work of the teachers is also gradually unfolding. For example, the research on meridians and the compilation of TCM literature are tasks in the national scientific research plan. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the school established a Red and Expert School for faculty and staff. Leading cadres of the TCM college, all Western medicine teachers, and some Party and government cadres participated in the study of TCM professional knowledge. The Red and Expert School will also organize the study of basic natural science knowledge for TCM.
    The Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine is located in Haiyuncang, Dongzhimen, covering an area of ​​more than 90,000 square meters. There are well-equipped physics, biology, chemistry and other laboratories, libraries, sports fields, etc., and a batch of new laboratories such as anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry are being prepared. In September, an affiliated hospital with more than 200 beds, as well as a medicinal herb garden for students' internships and productive labor, will be established successively. These will create good conditions for teachers and students to combine theory with practice and carry out scientific research work.
    At present, Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine has more than 160 students in two grades (female students account for about one-third). Some of them are high school graduates, some are government cadres, and some are demobilized soldiers. These young people participate in various political movements with enthusiasm and have a rich and colorful cultural and sports life. Scientific research groups composed of students, such as those focusing on *Treatise on Cold Damage*, meridians, drugs, acupuncture, and medical classics, have launched various research activities. Some students are working with faculty and staff to create electric models of acupuncture points, some are studying how to reformulate decoctions into pills, powders, and ointments with high efficacy, and some are going to the Western Hills to collect drug specimens. In addition, the school also has a TCM teacher training class, which specializes in training young TCM doctors sent from various places. There is also a Western Medicine Studying TCM research class, which specializes in absorbing senior Western medicine doctors to systematically study basic TCM knowledge in order to further sort out and improve the medical heritage of the motherland.

    成长中的北京中医学院
    为继承、发扬祖国医学遗产，培养大批掌握中医基础理论、中医医疗技术和具有现代医学基本知识的高级中医，1956年秋，全国同时成立了四所中医学院。北京中医学院是其中的一所。
    北京中医学院目前暂设一个医疗专业，以学习中医为主，辅以近代医学基础课程。中医理论课方面将学习医经选、本草学、伤寒论、金匮要略等四部经典著作，同时有内、外、妇、儿、眼、喉、针灸、方剂等共十四门中医课程。西医基础课包括生理学、解剖学、组织学、生物化学、药理学、微生物学、病理学等十一门课程。此外有政治、语文、生物、物理、化学、俄文和日文等普通基础课。学生在前五年学完上述三十多门课程以后，最后一年就到附属医院去进行毕业实习。经过以上六年的系统培养后，学生就具备中医学术理论，掌握中医医疗技术，能够独立担负一般疾病的医疗工作。
    现在，这个中医学院有八十多名教师。知名的中医于道济、任应秋、陈慎吾、单玉堂、方鸣谦等人，在这个学校担任教学指导或科学研究工作。西医基础课的师资大部分是由沈阳医学院支援的。两年多以来，教师们在集体备课、自编教材方面取得了很大的成绩，教学质量有了显著的提高。教师们的科学研究工作也正在逐渐展开，例如关于经络的研究、中医文献的整理即是国家科学研究规划中的任务。在大跃进的形势下，学校为教职工们创办了一所红专学校，中医学院的领导干部、全体西医教师和部分党政干部都参加了中医专业知识的学习。红专学校并将组织中医学习自然科学的基本知识。
    北京中医学院的校址设在东直门海运仓，占地九万多平方公尺。这里有设备齐全的物理、生物、化学等实验室、图书馆、运动场等等，并准备建立一批解剖、生理、生物化学等新的实验室。9月份，拥有两百多张病床的附属医院，以及为学生实习及生产劳动用的药圃将先后建立，这些为师生们理论联系实际、开展科学研究工作开创了良好的条件。
    目前，北京中医学院有两个年级的学生一百六十多人（女学生约占三分之一），他们有的是高中毕业生，有的是机关干部，也有转业军人。这些青年们热情饱满地参加各种政治运动；有着丰富多采的文娱体育生活。由学生们组成的伤寒、经络、药物、针灸、医经等科学研究小组，展开了各种研究活动。有的学生正同职工一起创制针灸穴位电动模型，有的研究如何把汤剂改制成疗效高的丸散膏丹，有的还到西山去采集药物标本。此外，学校还附设了中医师资班，专门培养由各地保送来的青年中医。另设西医学习中医研究班，专门吸收高级西医，系统学习中医基本知识，以便进一步整理提高祖国的医学遗产。  （朱继功）
