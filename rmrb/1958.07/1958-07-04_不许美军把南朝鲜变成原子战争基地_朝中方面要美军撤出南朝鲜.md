Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd. According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong: At the suggestion of the U.S. side, the Military Armistice Commission held its 84th meeting in Kaesong on the 2nd.

    At the meeting, Major General Jiang Shanghao, chief member of the Korean and Chinese side, exposed the behavior of the U.S. and Lee group in disregard of the Armistice Agreement and carrying out provocations for a new war in South Korea. He condemned the crimes of the U.S. aggressor group in consistently opposing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue in the past five years since the armistice.

    Jiang Shanghao said that the conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement played a significant role in easing international tensions and opened the way for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Since the armistice, the Korean and Chinese side have strictly abided by the Armistice Agreement and made all sincere efforts to maintain the Armistice Agreement and prevent it from being undermined by the U.S. side.

    Jiang Shanghao said that in order to realize the peaceful reunification of Korea, the Korean and Chinese side have put forward a series of practical plans and specific measures. The Korean People's Army reduced its forces by 80,000 troops and related military equipment in 1956, and the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew 19 divisions of troops and related military equipment from Korea from 1954 to 1955. Not only that, the Chinese People's Volunteers decided to completely withdraw from Korea by the end of December 1958. They have completed the first batch of withdrawals and are about to begin the second batch. However, on the contrary, the U.S. imperialist aggressor group, which does not desire peace, has been opposing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue ever since it invaded and occupied South Korea, and has been implementing a colonial enslavement policy in South Korea.

    Jiang Shanghao pointed out that at the same time, U.S. imperialism is also plotting to turn South Korea into its atomic missile base for aggression in the Far East, making it part of the U.S. imperialists' overall atomic war plan. The U.S. side has announced that it will begin setting up missile bases in areas close to the demilitarized zone from July 4, and will also hold "test firings" of "Honest John" rockets on July 4. This provocative act by the U.S. side is a blatant violation of the Armistice Agreement and a serious provocation to peace.

    Major General Jiang Shanghao pointed out that the U.S. aggressor army has no reason or basis to continue to remain in South Korea. The U.S. side must imitate the positive measures of the Korean and Chinese side and immediately withdraw its troops from South Korea. All the Korean people and peace-loving people around the world are closely watching the U.S. side's plot to undermine the Armistice Agreement and create provocative wars, and will never allow the U.S. side to turn South Korea into an atomic war base.

    In his speech, Major General Jiang Shanghao finally pointed out that if the U.S. side disregards the solemn warnings of the Korean and Chinese side and continues to adhere to its war policy, then it will bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    This meeting was convened at the suggestion of the U.S. side. At the beginning of the meeting, the U.S. side once again shamelessly demanded that the Korean and Chinese side "return" the South Korean civil aviation aircraft that defected to northern Korea on February 16 this year. As everyone knows, on this issue, the Korean and Chinese side has already stated its position in previous meetings of the Military Armistice Commission and the Secretary-General. The Korean and Chinese side believes that the issue of the defection of South Korean civil aviation aircraft has nothing to do with the Armistice Agreement, and therefore has nothing to do with the tasks of the Military Armistice Commission.

    Major General Jiang Shanghao, chief member of the Korean and Chinese side, thoroughly exposed the inside story of the U.S. and Lee group's clamor on this issue at the meeting, and firmly refused to discuss the U.S. side's absurd demands.

### 不许美军把南朝鲜变成原子战争基地  朝中方面要美军撤出南朝鲜

    不许美军把南朝鲜变成原子战争基地
    朝中方面要美军撤出南朝鲜
    新华社平壤3日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：在美方建议下，军事停战委员会2日在开城举行第八十四次会议。
    会上朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将揭露了美李集团无视停战协定，在南朝鲜进行挑拨新战争的行为。他对停战五年来美国侵略集团一贯反对和平解决朝鲜问题的罪行加以谴责。
    姜尚昊说，朝鲜停战协定的缔结，对缓和国际紧张局势起了不小的作用，它并为朝鲜问题的和平解决打开了道路。朝中方面自从停战以来一直严格遵守停战协定，并为维护停战协定、不让它遭到美方的破坏，作了一切有诚意的努力。
    姜尚昊说，为了实现朝鲜的和平统一，朝中方面提出了一系列的实践性的方案和具体措施，朝鲜人民军在1956年裁减八万名兵力和有关的军事装备，中国人民志愿军在1954年到1955年从朝鲜撤出了十九个师的兵力和有关的军事装备。不仅如此，中国人民志愿军决定在1958年12月底以前完全撤出朝鲜，他们已经完成了第一批撤军，即将开始第二批撤军。但是，与此相反，不希望和平的美国帝国主义侵略集团自从侵占南朝鲜以来直到今天，一直反对朝鲜问题的和平解决，并在南朝鲜实行殖民地奴役政策。
    姜尚昊指出，与此同时，美帝国主义还阴谋策划把南朝鲜变为它的侵略远东的原子导弹基地，使它成为美帝国主义全盘的原子战争计划的一部分。美方已经公布，将从7月4日开始在接近非军事区的地区设立导弹基地，并且还将在7月4日这一天举行“诚实的约翰”火箭的“试验射击”。美方的这种挑衅行为是对停战协定的粗暴破坏行为，也是对和平的严重的挑衅行为。
    姜尚昊少将指出美国侵略军没有任何理由和根据继续留在南朝鲜。美方必须仿效朝中方面的积极措施，立即从南朝鲜撤出军队。全体朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民严密注视美方破坏停战协定并制造挑衅性战争的阴谋活动，决不容许美方把南朝鲜变成原子战争基地。
    姜尚昊少将在发言中最后指出，如果美方不顾朝中方面的严正警告，仍继续坚持自己的战争政策，那么它将对由此而产生的一切后果负全部责任。
    这次的会议是美方建议召开的，在会议开始，美方曾再一次厚颜无耻地要求朝中方面“送还”今年2月16日起义到朝鲜北部来的南朝鲜民航机。大家知道，关于这个问题，朝中方面早已在过去几次的军事停战委员会和秘书长会议上申明过自己的立场。朝中方面认为，南朝鲜民航机起义的问题同停战协定没有任何关系，因而同军事停战委员会的任务没有任何关系。
    朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将在会上彻底揭露了美李集团借此叫嚣的内幕，并且坚决拒绝讨论美方的荒谬要求。
