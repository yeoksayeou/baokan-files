Four Housewives Run a Primary School

    According to the Shenyang Daily, four housewives from Yanfen Street in Tiexi District, Shenyang City, with the support of various parties, have established a private primary school without spending a penny of state funds.

    The four women who founded this private primary school are: Cheng Ruixin, Chen Lujie, Jin Jing, and Yang Suqing. In the past, they were all housewives managing household affairs and active participants in street literacy campaigns. During the Great Leap Forward, they bravely stepped out of their homes, determined to establish a primary school for the children in their street. To realize this ideal, for three months, their footsteps traversed the entire district, visiting more than forty units, including factories, government offices, and schools. They traveled over five thousand li and received enough building materials from these units to construct 210 square meters of housing. More than 700 construction workers and transport workers also came to support their school establishment. They also participated in the school's housing design and construction labor. For more than three months, they carried bricks, transported earth, and moved wood and tens of thousands of bricks and tiles, finally establishing a primary school.

    四名家庭妇女办小学
    据沈阳日报消息　沈阳市铁西区艳粉街的四名家庭妇女，在各方面的支援下，没有花国家一文钱，办起了一所民办小学。
    创办这所民办小学的四名妇女是：程蕊新、陈露洁、金静和杨素清。过去，她们都是主持家务的家庭主妇，街道扫盲的积极分子。在全民大跃进中，她们勇敢地走出家庭，决心为本街的儿童创办一所小学。为了实现这个理想，三个月来，她们的足迹踏遍全区，先后到工厂、机关和学校等四十多个单位，所走过的路程有五千多里，得到这些单位支援够修建二百一十平方公尺房屋所用的全部建筑材料。有七百多名建筑工人和运输工人也来支援她们办学。她们还参加了学校的房舍设计工作和建校劳动。三个多月来，她们挑砖、运土，搬运了木材和几万块砖瓦，终于办成了一所小学校。
