Shanxi Agricultural Scientists Predict
    Wheat Yield of 20,000 Jin Per Mu

    (Our Newspaper)  Wu Zao, Director of the Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Science Institute, published an article in the Shanxi Daily with photos of two large wheat ears. His article stated:  Take a look, everyone, these are two king wheat ears.  They grew on the dry land of the mountain gully in Shangyang Village, Tiaoshan Second Cooperative, Yongji County.  The ear of wheat on the right has a total of one hundred and sixty-four grains, and the ear on the left has a total of one hundred and twenty-two grains. These king wheat ears tell us that one mu of wheat can produce not only several thousand jin, but also tens of thousands of jin.  This year, many new high-yield records of wheat production of 3,000 jin, 4,000 jin, and more than 5,000 jin per mu have appeared across the country. The wheat produced by Shuanglou Cooperative in Shangqiu County, Henan Province, with a yield of 4,412 jin per mu, is characterized by a total of 1,639,600 ears per mu, with each ear containing 39 to 100 grains.  From this, we can conclude that if each mu grows to 1.63 million ears, and each ear has more than 160 grains, then each mu can produce more than 22,000 jin of wheat.

    Therefore, we plan to create a new record of 20,000 jin of wheat per mu next year based on a comprehensive combination of water, soil, fertilizer, seeds, and density. We must dare to think about things that people have never thought of before, and dare to create miracles that have never existed in ancient or modern times, either in China or abroad.

    山西农业科学家预计
    一亩小麦可产两万斤
    本报讯  山西省农业科学研究所所长武藻在山西日报上发表了一篇关于小麦产量的文章和有两个大麦穗的照片。他的文章这样说：大家看看，这是两个麦穗王。她生长在永济县七里乡上阳村条山二社的山沟旱地上。右边的一穗小麦共一百六十四粒，左边的一穗共一百二十二粒。这些麦穗王告诉我们：一亩小麦不仅可以产几千斤，而且可以产几万斤。今年全国各地出现了许多小麦亩产三千斤、四千斤、五千多斤的高产新纪录，河南商丘县双楼社亩产四千四百一十二斤的小麦，其特点是，每亩共达一百六十三万九千六百穗，每穗麦颗达三十九至一百粒。由此可以得出结论：每亩长到一百六十三万穗，每穗麦粒达到一百六十多粒，每亩即可产麦二万二千多斤。
    因此，我们计划明年在水、土、肥、种、密综合配好的基础上，创造小麦亩产二万斤的新纪录。我们要敢想人从来没有想过的事，要敢创造古今中外从来没有的奇迹。
