    Not Afraid of the Cold Wind
    Qian Yin
    It seems this has become a pattern: those who are determined to make inventions, creations, and technological innovations will, to varying degrees, encounter criticism and obstruction on their path forward; rarely is it smooth sailing. Historical materials from both ancient and modern times, from China and abroad, also illustrate this point. Why?
    The reason is simple: in the old society, due to class contradictions, because inventions and creations directly harmed the interests of the ruling class, inventors and innovators were subjected to oppression by the rulers. Under the socialist system, this type of obstruction naturally no longer exists with the change in production relations. This is because, in our society, the relationships between people are equal, mutually supportive, and comradely; there is no conflict of interest between people. However, there are still differences in people's understanding between the advanced and the backward; moreover, people's understanding often lags behind reality. This contradiction between advanced and backward, where understanding lags behind reality, often becomes a resistance hindering the rapid growth of new things.
    Inventions, creations, and technological innovations are effective methods for developing productive forces; they are a nascent and progressive force that no one can stop. In today's vigorously developing technological innovation movement, should enterprise staff, especially enterprise leaders, adopt an enthusiastic and supportive attitude, creating conditions for technological innovators? Or should they be critical and nitpicking, blowing cold winds and pouring cold water on the masses? This is a matter of principle.
    Of course, there will be situations where some innovation content and projects are unheard of and unseen, making it difficult to make a decision to approve or deny them immediately. Even in such cases, one should maintain an enthusiastic and supportive attitude, avoiding cynicism and ridicule, and not labeling them as fantasies or impractical.
    On the other hand, for those who propose technological innovations, it is crucial to be bold in creating, daring to think and act, and not being afraid of cold winds or cold water. To achieve this, one must eliminate feelings of inferiority. One must possess an unwavering spirit that cannot be intimidated, stumped, crushed, or destroyed. It is better if others support you, but if they don't, persuade them and strive for their support. If persuasion fails and support cannot be gained, persuade and strive again, while influencing others with practical actions. In the end, when success is achieved, others will certainly be convinced in the face of the facts. At the same time, only with firm conviction can one achieve the following in practice: seize every opportunity, think of every method, do what one thinks of, do it and then observe, observe and then revise.
    The report on the Andong Machinery Factory manufacturing tractors is a very persuasive piece of material. Initially, they were afraid of being ridiculed, so they didn't even dare to raise the banner of manufacturing tractors, instead calling it a "diesel traction machine." They were afraid of being laughed at. In fact, some people were laughing at them, saying they were fantasizing and being impractical. However, they were not afraid of cold water or cold winds, and they withstood external ridicule and sarcasm, finally succeeding. This kind of fact tells people: only those who eliminate feelings of inferiority and are not afraid of the cold wind are the ones who achieve the final victory.

    似乎这已经成为一种规律：凡是有志于发明创造、技术革新的人，在他们前进的道路上，都或多或少会受到一些责难和阻挠，很少是一帆风顺的。古今中外的史料也说明了这一点。为什么？
    道理很简单，在旧社会里，由于阶级的矛盾，由于发明创造直接危害了统治阶级的利益，因此，发明家、革新者，就要受到统治者的压迫。在社会主义制度下，这种性质的阻挠随着生产关系的改变当然不存在了，因为在我们的社会里，人与人之间的关系，是平等互助同志式的关系，人与人之间并没有什么利害冲突。但是，在人们的认识上还有先进与落后的差别；而且人们的认识往往是落后于实际的，这种先进与落后的差别，认识落后于实际的矛盾，往往就成为阻碍新事物迅速成长的阻力。
    发明创造，技术革新，这是发展生产力的有效方法，是一种新生的、前进的力量，是任何人想阻拦也阻拦不住的。在技术革新运动蓬勃开展的今天，企业工作人员特别是企业领导人员，是采取热情支持的态度，为技术革新者创造条件呢？还是这也指责那也挑剔的给群众吹冷风泼冷水呢？这就是一个原则性的问题了。
    当然，也会碰到这样的情况，有些革新的内容和项目，不少是闻所未闻见所未见的，一时还下不了赞同或否定的决心。即使在这样的情况下，也应抱热情支持的态度，切忌冷嘲热讽，说这是空想，那是不切实际。
    在另一方面，对技术革新的建议者来说，大胆创造，敢想敢干，不怕吹冷风，不怕泼冷水，这一点又是十分重要的。要做到这一点，就必须扫掉自卑感。要有一种吓不倒、难不倒、冲不垮、打不烂的气派。别人支持更好，别人不支持，就说服争取他，说服不了，争取不来，再说服再争取，同时用实际行动来影响别人。到最后，成功了，在事实面前，别人一定会信服的。同时，也只有有了坚定的信念，在实践中才能做到：有门就钻、是法就想、想到就做、做了再看、看了再改。
    安东机械厂制造拖拉机的报道，是一个很有说服力的材料。开始，他们怕别人讥讽，连制造拖拉机这个旗帜都不敢扛出去，只是叫“柴油牵引机”。他们怕人家笑话。事实也有人在笑话他们，说他们是空想，不切实际。然而他们不怕泼冷水，不怕吹冷风，顶住了外来的冷嘲热讽，最后成功了。这样的事实告诉了人们：只有扫除自卑感不怕冷风吹的人，才是取得最后胜利的人。
