Xinhua News Agency, Dandong, July 14th. Today, a powerful anti-aircraft artillery unit, part of the second group of returning Chinese People's Volunteers, entered the triumphal arch laden with victory and honor, and was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Dandong.

　　During the Korean War, this anti-aircraft artillery unit participated in more than two thousand air battles, creating a brilliant record of shooting down one hundred and nineteen enemy aircraft and damaging two hundred and seventy-two. Together with fraternal air defense units and Korean People's Army comrades, they thoroughly shattered the "air superiority" boasted by the American aggressors.

　　The citizens of Dandong, who had suffered from the harm of American aerial bandits in the early stages of the Korean War, greeted their heroic air hunters today with unparalleled excitement. As the steel torrent rumbled across the Yalu River Railway Bridge, seen off by the Korean people in Sinuiju, thousands of Dandong citizens who had been waiting at the north end of the bridge set off firecrackers, beat gongs and drums, and rushed forward to shake hands with the returning heroes, adorning the magnificent cannons with honorary flowers and red scarves. Then, the welcoming people lined the streets to welcome the heroes to the lawn by the Yalu River, braving the scorching sun and river breeze, and held a warm and jubilant gathering. The Dandong Municipal Cultural Troupe and many amateur art teams from factories and schools gave wonderful performances, reporting the achievements of the Great Leap Forward to the most beloved people of the motherland and the people of Dandong.

　　When the leading organs of this heroic anti-aircraft artillery unit arrived, leading Party and government officials, headed by Duan Yongjie, Secretary of the Dandong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor, also went to the station with the masses to welcome them.

    满载胜利和荣誉凯旋归国
    新华社安东14日电　今天，中国人民志愿军第二批归国部队的一支强大的高射炮部队，满载胜利和荣誉进入凯旋门，受到安东市各界人民的热烈欢迎。
    这支高射炮部队在朝鲜战争中，参加了两千多次对空作战，创建了击落一百一十九架、击伤二百七十二架敌机的光辉战绩，和兄弟防空部队及朝鲜人民军战友一道，彻底粉碎了美国侵略军所吹嘘的“空中优势”。
    在朝鲜战争初期曾遭到美国空中强盗危害的安东市民，今天怀着无比激奋的心情迎接自己英雄的对空猎手。当钢铁巨流在新义州市朝鲜人民的欢送下隆隆滚过鸭绿江铁桥的时候，久候在大桥北头的成千名安东市民，燃起鞭炮，敲起锣鼓，纷纷涌向前去和凯旋英雄们握手，给雄伟的大炮戴上光荣花、红领巾。接着，欢迎的人们又把英雄们夹道迎接到鸭绿江边的草坪上，冒着烈日和江风，进行了热情洋溢的大联欢。安东市文工团和许多工厂、学校的业余文艺队都作了精彩演出，向最可爱的人报告祖国和安东市人民大跃进的成就。
    在这支英雄的高射炮部队的领导机关到达时，以中共安东市委书记、市长段永杰为首的党政负责人，也和广大群众一道前往车站欢迎。
