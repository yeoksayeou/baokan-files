Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, July 23rd: Many Danish newspapers have condemned the US-UK aggression against the Middle East and expressed concern about the possible consequences of this war adventure.

Although the "Social-Demokraten," the organ of the ruling Social Democratic Party, on the one hand, is concerned about the consequences of US-UK aggression, and on the other hand, defends this aggression, some local newspapers of the party have sternly condemned the US-UK aggression. For example, "Demokraten" pointed out on the 19th that the method of suppressing the Arab people with warships is no longer feasible. Prior to this, "Ny Tid" also pointed out that US President Eisenhower's insistence that the US invading forces in Lebanon "are the forerunners of the United Nations is unconvincing"; the US attempt to use the UN Charter to defend its aggressive behavior is "also unacceptable." This newspaper praised the British Labour Party's opposition to the Conservative government's sending troops to Jordan, thus implying its dissatisfaction with the official policy of the Social Democratic Party.

The Radical Party's "Politiken" expressed obvious unease about the US-UK armed intervention. This newspaper said: "The landing of (US troops) on foreign shores has caused a lot of concern." When talking about the British sending troops to Jordan, the newspaper added: "Any expansion of this action will make the withdrawal of (US-UK troops) doubly difficult and increase people's anxiety and danger." The party's "Holbæk Venstreblad" even advocated that the Nordic countries take joint action to stop the aggression and defend peace.

Now, even the Conservative Party's "Berlingske Tidende," which defends US-UK aggression, admits that "nationalism is now a factor of great influence in Arab countries." The "Social-Demokraten," which takes the same reactionary stance, also realizes that the military power of the United States and Britain cannot "solve any political problems" in the Middle East.

### 丹麦报纸谴责美英干涉中东  呼吁北欧各国联合行动保卫和平

    丹麦报纸谴责美英干涉中东
    呼吁北欧各国联合行动保卫和平
    据新华社23日讯　哥本哈根消息：丹麦许多报纸都谴责美英对中东的侵略，并对这种战争冒险可能引起的后果表示担忧。
    尽管执政党社会民主党机关报“社会民主党人报”一方面担心美英侵略的后果，另一方面又为这种侵略辩护，这个党的一些地方报纸却严正地谴责美英侵略。例如，“民主报”在19日指出，用军舰来镇压阿拉伯人民的办法现在已经行不通了。在这以前，“新时代报”也指出，美国总统艾森豪威尔硬说美国在黎巴嫩的侵略军“是联合国的先驱，这是不能令人信服的”；美国企图用联合国宪章来为它的侵略行为辩护，这“也是令人难以接受的”。这家报纸赞扬英国工党反对保守党政府出兵约旦，这样来暗示它对社会民主党官方政策的不满。
    激进党的“政治报”对美英的武装干涉表示了明显的不安。这家报纸说：“（美国军队）在外国海岸登陆事件引起人们很多的忧虑。”在谈到英国出兵约旦的时候，报纸又说：“这种行动的任何扩大都会使（美英军队）撤退加倍地困难，并且使人们的焦虑和危险增加。”这个党的“贺尔拜克左翼报”甚至主张北欧各国采取联合行动去制止侵略，保卫和平。
    现在，甚至是袒护美英侵略的保守党“贝林新闻”也承认：“民族主义现在已经是在阿拉伯国家中发生巨大影响的因素。”采取同样反动立场的“社会民主党人报”也认识到，美国和英国的军事力量在中东“解决不了任何政治问题”。
