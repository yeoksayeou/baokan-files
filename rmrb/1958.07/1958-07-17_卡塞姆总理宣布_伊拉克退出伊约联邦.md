Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 16th - According to Baghdad Radio, Iraqi Premier Qasim issued a statement on the evening of the 15th, announcing Iraq's withdrawal from the Iraq-Jordan Federation.

The statement announced that the government of the Iraqi Republic considers all laws related to this federation to be invalid, and that Iraq's financial and military obligations incurred by forming this federation with Jordan no longer have any connection with Iraq.

The statement said that this so-called federation "is neither a genuine federation nor in the interests of the people of both countries." The statement said: "The purpose of establishing this federation was to consolidate the imperial regimes that have been eliminated by history and to protect the interests of the rulers, whose positions were contrary to the will of the people, and they never worked for the welfare of the people."

Baghdad Radio also reported after broadcasting the statement that the flags of the Iraq-Jordan Federation had been taken down throughout Iraq, and the Iraqi national flag was hoisted instead.

The so-called "Arab Federation" formed by Iraq and Jordan was formally announced on May 15 this year by King Faisal, who has been overthrown, and King Hussein of Jordan. The people of Iraq and Jordan have opposed the establishment of this federation.

    卡塞姆总理宣布
    伊拉克退出伊约联邦
    新华社开罗16日电　据巴格达电台报道，伊拉克总理卡塞姆在15日晚上发表声明，宣布伊拉克退出伊拉克—约旦联邦。
    声明宣布，伊拉克共和国政府认为，所有的和这个联邦有关的法律都一律无效，伊拉克由于同约旦结成这个联邦所承担的财政和军事义务都不再和伊拉克发生任何关系。
    声明说，这个所谓联邦“既不是真正的联邦，也不符合两国人民的利益。”声明说：“建立这个联邦的目的是为了巩固已为历史所淘汰的帝王政权和保护统治者的利益，而这些统治者所占据的地位是违背人民意志的，他们从来没有为人民的福利工作过。”
    巴格达电台在广播了这篇声明之后还报道，伊拉克全国各地都扯下了伊拉克—约旦联邦的旗帜，而挂上了伊拉克国旗。
    伊拉克和约旦结成的所谓“阿拉伯联邦”，是在今年5月15日由已被推翻的费萨尔国王和约旦国王侯赛因正式宣告成立的。伊拉克和约旦两国各地人民曾纷纷反对成立这个联邦。
