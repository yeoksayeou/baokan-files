    Xinhua News Agency, London, July 27th: The British "Daily Mail" published a dispatch from Washington by Wilson Broadbent on July 21st, stating that since launching the armed invasion of Lebanon, US President Eisenhower has been restless about the consequences of this American adventure.
    According to White House officials, he now paces back and forth in his office day after day, hoping to know the outcome of the Middle East situation.
    He insists on being told the smallest details. Almost every hour he fires off instructions to the Department of Defense.
    Broadbent said: "It is said that after the landing in Lebanon, the President (Eisenhower) was considering the final attitude towards Nasser. But he did not know at the time, and no one else here knew, that Nasser was on his way to Moscow."

    艾森豪威尔坐立不安
    据新华社27日讯　伦敦消息：英国“每日邮报”7月21日刊载威尔逊·布劳德本特发自华盛顿的一篇电讯说，美国总统艾森豪威尔自从发动对黎巴嫩的武装侵略后，一直对美国这次冒险行动的后果如何感到坐立不安。
    据白宫官员们说，他现在一天又一天地在他的办公室里踱来踱去，希望知道中东局势的结局。
    他坚持要人告诉他最微小的细节。几乎每小时他都像开炮似的向国防部发出指示。
    布劳德本特说：“据说，在黎巴嫩登陆以后，总统（艾森豪威尔）在考虑最后对待纳赛尔的态度。可是他当时不知道，在这里其他人谁也不知道，纳赛尔正在赴莫斯科的途中。”
