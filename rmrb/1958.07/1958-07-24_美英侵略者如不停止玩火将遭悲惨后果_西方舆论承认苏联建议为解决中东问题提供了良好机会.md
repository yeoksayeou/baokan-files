Xinhua News Agency report: The Soviet Union's proposal to immediately convene a five-power summit to resolve the Middle East crisis caused by U.S.-British armed intervention has been warmly welcomed by world public opinion. Under popular pressure, many Western politicians and newspapers have had to agree with the Soviet proposal and express dissatisfaction with the attitude of the U.S. and British governments.

	Many British Labour Party Members of Parliament
	Demand Macmillan Accept the Soviet Proposal

In the meeting held in the British House of Lords on the 21st, many Labour and Conservative members of Parliament demanded that the government accept the Soviet proposal to hold a summit meeting in the near future.

Labour leader Lord Alexander demanded that the government issue a clear and affirmative statement on the Soviet proposal. He said, "It would be a tragic thing if this matter were to be delayed."

Conservative member of Parliament Lord Tweedsmuir said that Khrushchev's letter "provides an unprecedented opportunity." He said, "I hope the government understands that we should seize this opportunity immediately."

Liberal leader Lord Rea requested the Leader of the House, Lord Home, to give a clear answer: Has the British government rejected or accepted Khrushchev's proposal? Home replied that Britain "is studying this proposal with its allies."

Former Labour Prime Minister Attlee also advocated holding a summit meeting.

On the same day, Labour leader Gaitskell said in the House of Commons that, considering the need to study ways to ease the "dangerous situation in the Middle East," he requested Prime Minister Macmillan to give an affirmative answer to Khrushchev's proposal. Gaitskell said, "Regardless of the Americans' views, the people of our country generally hope that such a meeting will be held as soon as possible."

	British Newspapers Also Believe
	U.S. and Britain's Rejection of Soviet Proposal Will Not Be Forgiven by the People

The British "News Chronicle" published an editorial on July 21 stating that hesitation by the U.S. and Britain on the Soviet proposal "would be incomprehensible to public opinion in most parts of the world. If refused, it will not be forgiven by the overwhelming majority of people who yearn for peace..." The newspaper also pointed out: "Western policy has proven to be bankrupt, and we must seek a new policy. It is possible that East and West can agree not to engage in any political interference, so that the Arabs can handle their own problems. Although this possibility may be small, it is certainly worth striving for."

	"The Daily Herald" pointed out in an editorial: "The British public unanimously advocates a rapid high-level meeting with Mr. Khrushchev in order to try to eliminate the dangers in the Middle East. We say to Prime Minister Macmillan: Britain hopes that you will no longer hesitate and should announce a decision to hold talks."

Labour MP Crossman wrote in "The Daily Mirror": "We should accept Khrushchev's proposal to hold high-level talks on the Middle East issue."

	West German Newspapers Also Say
	Rejecting the Soviet Proposal Would Leave No Words to Explain to Public Opinion

The Soviet Union's proposal to immediately convene a summit meeting to resolve the serious situation in the Middle East caused by U.S.-British armed intervention is the focus of attention for West German newspapers. Although pro-Adenauer newspapers have tried their best to downplay the significance of this proposal, most West German bourgeois newspapers have expressed support for the proposal.

The "Neue Rhein Zeitung" believes that the Soviet proposal is extremely important. The newspaper wrote that if Eisenhower and Macmillan reject this proposal, they will find it difficult to find reasons to explain it to world public opinion. The newspaper then talked about rumors that the United States was preparing to use "leave everything to the United Nations for discussion" as an excuse to reject the Soviet proposal. The newspaper wrote in a mocking tone, "Strange argument! The U.S. and Britain did not even think of the United Nations when taking military action against Lebanon and Jordan."

The Social Democratic "Badische Neueste Nachrichten" wrote that the situation is very serious; it does not allow people to easily reject Khrushchev's proposal on the pretext of a "propaganda campaign."

Even the Bonn "General-Anzeiger," which has been trying to defend the U.S.-British armed intervention, had to express support for the Soviet proposal. The newspaper wrote that there is no time more in need of a meeting of heads of state than these cloudy days. It would be unwise for the West to simply reject this proposal. The whole world wants to hear news of negotiations, not the sound of gunfire.

	Swedish and Swiss Newspapers Point Out
	U.S. and British Aggressors Are Under Tremendous Pressure from World Public Opinion

The Swedish "Dagens Nyheter" published a commentary on the 21st saying that Khrushchev's proposal "will undoubtedly mobilize broad public opinion that is eager to seize every opportunity to ease (tensions), and it will put tremendous pressure on the United States and Britain." The newspaper said that Western public opinion views the events in Iraq as "a typical example of Arab nationalism rising."

The newspaper believes that "there is no doubt that intervention in Lebanon and Jordan has exacerbated the contradiction between the West and people of color." The newspaper said that the problem now is the withdrawal of American and British troops.

The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" wrote in an editorial on the 21st that rejecting the Soviet proposal would be a mistake. The newspaper believes that only through another Geneva conference and an agreement reached by the major powers can the further development of the Middle East crisis be prevented.

    美英侵略者如不停止玩火将遭悲惨后果
    西方舆论承认苏联建议为解决中东问题提供了良好机会
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：苏联关于立即召开五国首脑会议解决由于美英武装干涉而引起的中东危机的建议，已经受到世界舆论的热烈欢迎。在人民的压力下，西方许多政界人士和报纸也不得不赞成苏联建议，并对美英两国政府的态度表示不满。
            英国工党许多议员
        要求麦克米伦接受苏联建议
    在英国上院21日举行的会议上，许多工党议员和保守党议员要求政府接受苏联提出的关于在最近举行政府首脑会议的建议。
    工党领袖亚历山大勋爵要求政府就苏联建议发表明确的和肯定的声明。他说：“如果把这件事拖延下去，将是一件很悲惨的事”。
    保守党议员特维奥特勋爵说，赫鲁晓夫的信“提供了前所未有的机会”。他说：“我希望政府明白，我们应该立即抓住这个机会。”
    自由党领袖雷伊勋爵请求上院领袖休姆勋爵作出明确的答复：英国政府拒绝了，还是接受了赫鲁晓夫的建议？休姆回答说，英国“正在同盟国一道研究这个建议”。
    前工党首相艾德礼也主张举行最高级会议。
    同一天，工党领袖盖次克尔在下院说，考虑到必须研究缓和“中东危险局势”的途径，他要求首相麦克米伦对赫鲁晓夫的建议作出肯定的回答。盖次克尔说，“不管美国人的观点怎样，我国人民普遍希望尽快召开这种会议”。
              英国报纸也认为
    美英拒绝苏联建议将得不到人民宽恕
    英国“新闻纪事报”7月21日发表社论说，美英如果对苏联建议“迟疑不决将是世界大部分地区的舆论所不能理解的。如果拒绝，那将是人类当中渴望和平……的压倒大多数人所不能宽恕的。”这家报纸又指出：“西方的政策已经证明是破产了，我们必须寻求一个新的政策。可能东西方可以商定不进行任何政治干涉，以便让阿拉伯人去处理他们自己的问题。虽然这种可能性也许很少，但是这肯定是值得争取的。”
      “每日先驱报”在社论中指出：“英国公众一致主张迅速同赫鲁晓夫先生举行高级会议，以便设法消除中东的危险。我们向麦克米伦首相说：英国希望，您现在不要再犹豫不定，应当宣布决定进行会谈。”
    工党议员克罗斯曼在“每日镜报”上发表文章说：“我们应当接受赫鲁晓夫就中东问题举行高级会谈的建议。”
                  西德报纸也说
      拒绝苏联建议就无词向舆论交代
    苏联关于立即召开最高级会议解决由于美英武装干涉而引起的中东严重局势的建议是西德报纸注意的中心。尽管亲阿登纳的报纸极力想贬低这一建议的意义，但是西德大多数资产阶级报纸表示赞成这个建议。
    “新莱因报”认为苏联的建议极为重要。这家报纸写道，艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦如果拒绝这个建议，他们将很难找到理由向世界舆论交代。报纸接着谈到关于美国方面准备用“一切交给联合国讨论”作为借口来拒绝苏联建议的传闻，报纸用嘲笑的口吻写道，“奇怪的论点！美英对黎巴嫩和约旦采取军事行动时却根本不曾想到联合国。”
    社会民主党的“巴登汇报”写道，局势十分严重；它不容许人们仅仅用“宣传行动”为借口就轻易地拒绝赫鲁晓夫的建议。
    连一直企图替美英武装干涉行动进行辩护的波恩“总通告报”也不得不对苏联的建议表示赞同。这家报纸写道，再没有比目前这种乌云密布的日子更需要由各国政府首脑来举行会议的了。西方如果干脆拒绝这个建议将是不智的。全世界希望听到谈判的消息，而不希望听到枪炮声。
            瑞典和瑞士报纸指出
    美英侵略者受到世界舆论巨大的压力
    瑞典的“斯德哥尔摩日报”21日发表评论说，赫鲁晓夫的建议“无疑地将把渴望抓住一切缓和（紧张局势）的机会的广泛舆论动员起来，它将使得英美遭到巨大的压力。”报纸说，西方的舆论都把伊拉克的事件看作“阿拉伯民族主义起义的一个典型”。
    报纸认为，“毫无疑问，在黎巴嫩和约旦的干涉加剧了西方和有色人民的矛盾”。报纸说，现在的问题是撤出美国和英国军队。
    “瑞士报”在21日的社论中写道，拒绝苏联的建议将是一个错误。这家报纸认为，只有通过另一次日内瓦会议和由各大国达成协议才能阻止中东危机的进一步发展。
