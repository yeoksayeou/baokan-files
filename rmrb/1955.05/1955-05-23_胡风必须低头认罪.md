　　Hu Feng Must Lower His Head and Confess His Crimes
　　Lu Yudao
　　I am a natural science worker. As natural science workers, we are united around the Party, engaged in scientific research or science education, with one goal: to serve the socialist construction of the motherland. This goal is consistent with that of the literary and art circles, with the entire academic and cultural circles, and with the will and actions of the people of the whole country.
　　Just as we were advancing under the leadership of the Party towards this common goal, we read Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" and the materials revealed by Shu Wu exposing Hu Feng's twenty years of anti-Party and anti-people crimes of plotting to undermine the people's revolutionary cause in the "People's Daily", and felt immense indignation.
　　In the past few months, a criticism of Hu Feng's idealist literary and artistic thought has been launched domestically. At that time, we regarded the Hu Feng issue as an ideological issue. After reading Shu Wu's revealed materials of Hu Feng's anti-Party behavior, I felt that this was no longer an ideological issue, but a political issue.
　　For twenty years, the Party and progressive literary and art circles have often shown concern for Hu Feng, criticized his consistent anti-Marxist literary and artistic thought, and helped him recognize his mistakes. Hu Feng not only did not accept it, but instead spewed blood, slandering Party and non-Party progressive literary and art workers as "mandarin gowns," "philistines," "masters," "imperial envoys," and "nobility." What does this mean? This is clearly being hostile to the Party and progressive literary and art circles.
　　Hu Feng not only opposed the Party and progressive literary and art circles himself, but also organized factions and colluded with groups. For twenty years, he directed the spearhead of "struggle" at the Party and the people. He used various conspiracies and tricks to resolutely oppose to the end, such as what he called "strengthening strength," "making persistent efforts," and "coexisting and dying with the position," using "cluster grenade" tactics, and using the vicious means of "a whip wrapped in rubber and steel wire to beat prisoners, causing injuries that are not visible on the surface," and through written publications, he frantically attacked the Party and the people, and attacked the Party's literary and artistic line. What he attacked was not only the Party's literary and artistic line, but actually the revolution led by the Party.
　　After liberation, until today, Hu Feng and his group still have been organized to attack the Party and the people, attacking the socialist revolution line led by the Party. This is not only the enemy of the literary and artistic circles, but also the enemy of the people of the whole country.
　　Under such frantic anti-Party and anti-people conspiracies, Hu Feng made such a disguised self-criticism. This self-criticism is completely deceptive nonsense. We will never be deceived by this.
　　We are determined to make Hu Feng lower his head and thoroughly confess his crimes. We also have the confidence to thoroughly crush the conspiracies of Hu Feng and his group.
　　Any conspiracy of Hu Feng will never escape the giant palm of the people.

　　胡风必须低头认罪
　　卢于道
    我是一个自然科学工作者。作为自然科学工作者，我们团结在党的周围，从事科学研究或科学教育工作，目标就是一个：为祖国的社会主义建设服务。这个目标是和文艺界一致的，是和整个学术文化界一致的，也是和全国人民的意志和行动一致的。
    正当我们在这个一致的目标之下，在党的领导下前进的时候，我们读到“人民日报”上胡风的
  “我的自我批判”和舒芜揭露的胡风二十年来反党反人民、阴谋破坏人民革命事业的罪恶行为的材料，感到无比的愤恨。
    这几个月来，国内已展开了对胡风唯心主义文艺思想的批判，那时，我们是把胡风问题作为思想问题来看待的。看了舒芜所揭发的胡风反党行为的材料之后，我感到这已经不是思想问题，而是政治问题了。
    二十年来，党及进步文艺界对胡风经常予以关心，对他的一贯反马克思主义文艺思想予以批评，帮他认清自己的错误；胡风非但不接受，反而含血喷人，把党的和非党的进步文艺工作者污蔑为“马褂”“市侩”“老爷”“钦差”“权贵”，这是什么意思？这分明是和党及进步文艺界为敌。
    胡风不仅是自己同党及进步文艺界为敌，并且组织宗派，纠合集团，二十年来，把“斗争”的矛头指向党，指向人民。他用各种阴谋诡计，坚决反动到底，如他所谓“加强实力”，“再接再厉”，“与阵地共存亡”，用“集束手榴弹”战术，用“橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”的凶恶手段，通过文字刊物，向党和人民猖狂进攻，向党的文艺路线进攻。他所进攻的不只是党的文艺路线，实际上是党所领导的革命。
    胡风在解放以后，直至今天为止，他和他的集团，仍然有组织地向党向人民进攻，进攻党所领导的社会主义革命路线。这就不只是文艺界的敌人，而且是全国人民的敌人。
    胡风在这样猖狂反党反人民的阴谋行动之下，作出了那样伪装的自我批判，这种自我批判完全是骗人的鬼话。我们决不受这种欺骗。
    我们坚决要胡风低下头来，彻底交代罪行。我们也有信心，能够将胡风及其集团的阴谋诡计彻底粉碎。
    胡风的任何阴谋，决逃不过人民的巨掌。
