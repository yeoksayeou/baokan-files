　　Listening to Criticism Should Not Be Divided into "Superior" and "Inferior"
　　Zeng Fu
    Suppose someone raises the question: Is it permissible to apply to a school without meeting the qualifications—for example, applying directly to a university without having graduated from primary school? Under normal circumstances, it can be stated with certainty that this is not permissible.

    Suppose someone else raises the question: Is it permissible to criticize others without qualification—for example, subordinates criticizing superiors, or those with weak abilities criticizing those with strong abilities? Under normal circumstances, it can be stated with certainty that this is permissible.

    Unfortunately, in real life, some of those being criticized, like school admissions, first "examine" the qualifications of the critics and then decide whether to "admit" their opinions. Such examples are not uncommon.

    For example, there is a department that has implemented a new measure in its work. This new measure has a loophole. After discovering it, a cadre enthusiastically proposed to the person in charge an opinion to remedy this loophole. After listening, the person in charge not only refused to consider his opinion, but also fundamentally denied that it was a loophole. Not long after, the superior of this person in charge also discovered this loophole and put forward an opinion almost identical to that of the cadre. This time, the person in charge naturally accepted this criticism that he had originally refused to accept.

    This example is not prominent or serious, but it typically illustrates the different attitudes of some of those being criticized towards the same criticism. If there is a cow, no one would point to it and say: This is a horse. Because a cow is a cow and definitely not a horse, the same in everyone's eyes. Of course, problems in work are different from objects and are not so simply and easily seen at a glance. However, as long as one studies carefully and analyzes diligently, anyone can discover some problems, more or less.

    Therefore, one must never say that only superiors can see problems and only accept criticism from superiors, while subordinates cannot see problems and criticism from subordinates should not be accepted. It should be acknowledged that criticism from superiors can point out the shortcomings and errors in work from a leadership perspective; similarly, criticism from subordinates can point out the shortcomings and errors in work from the perspective of the led. Whoever can calmly listen to criticism from different perspectives will comprehensively discover the problems existing in their work, and whoever will do the work better.

    Currently, the key to carrying out criticism in many departments is not that superiors criticizing subordinates is ineffective, but that subordinates criticizing superiors is ineffective. Therefore, it is hoped that those who only ask whether the critic's position is high, and do not ask whether the critic's opinion is correct, should humbly listen to the criticism of the masses and earnestly absorb valuable experiences and lessons from the criticism of the masses.

### 听取批评不应有“上”“下”之分

　　听取批评不应有“上”“下”之分
　　曾孚
    假定有谁提出这样一个问题：投考学校不限资格——例如小学还没有毕业就直接投考大学之类——是不是可以呢？在通常情况下，可以肯定说，这是不可以的。
    再假定有谁又提出这样一个问题：批评别人不限资格——例如被领导者批评领导者、能力弱的人批评能力强的人之类——是不是可以呢？在通常情况下，可以肯定说，这是可以的。
    可惜，在实际生活中，有些被批评者却像学校招生一样，首先对批评者的资格加以“考查”，然后再决定是否“录取”他的意见。这样的事例并不算少。
    比如有一个部门，在工作上实行了一个新的措施。这个新措施中有个漏洞，一个干部发现以后，热心地向负责人提出了弥补这个漏洞的意见。负责人听了以后，不但拒绝考虑他的意见，而且根本不承认这是漏洞。过了不久，这位负责人的上级也发现了这个漏洞，并且提出和那个干部近乎相同的意见。这次，这位负责人很自然地接受了这个原来拒绝接受的批评。
    这个例证，并不是突出的、严重的，但是，它却典型地说明了有些被批评者对待同一批评的不同态度。如果有一头牛，谁也不会指着它说：这是一匹马。因为，牛就是牛，决不是马，在谁看来都是一样。自然，工作中的问题和实物有所不同，不是那么简单容易地可以一眼看出来。不过，只要仔细研究、认真分析，谁也可以或多或少地发现一些问题。
    因此，决不能说，只有上级才能看出问题，而且只能接受上级的批评，凡是下级就不能看出问题，下级的批评就不应接受。应当承认，上级的批评，可以从领导的角度上指出工作中的缺点和错误；同样，下级的批评，可以从被领导者的角度上指出工作中的缺点和错误。谁能冷静地听取来自不同方面的批评，谁就会全面地发现自己工作中存在的问题，谁就会把工作做得更好。
    现在，在很多部门开展批评的关键，不在于上级批评下级不发生作用，而在于下级批评上级不发生作用。因此，希望那些只问批评者职位高不高、不问批评者意见对不对的人，应该虚心听取群众的批评，认真从群众的批评中去吸收宝贵的经验教训。
