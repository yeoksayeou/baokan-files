Xinhua News Agency, 14th. Regarding the British Hong Kong Authorities' seizure of the property of our airline, Wang Fengwu, Acting Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, issued the following statement on May 14, 1955:
    On the morning of May 9, 1955, at 10:00 AM (Hong Kong time), the British Hong Kong authorities dispatched over 400 armed police officers to forcibly invade the China National Aviation Corporation's warehouse located at Ma Tau Wai Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong (formerly known as Bailey Shipyard), which belongs to our China National Aviation Corporation, assaulting our employees. On the afternoon of the same day, at 2:00 PM, they used force to coerce all employees to withdraw from the premises, and subsequently handed over the aforementioned warehouse building and its affiliated assets to the American Sibler Hegner Company, "taking over" under the direction of American imperialist element Chennault. This is another serious violation and unreasonable seizure of the two companies' assets in Hong Kong by the British Hong Kong authorities, following their collusion with American imperialist elements in 1952 to illegally seize 71 aircraft and their affiliated assets left in Hong Kong by our China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation.
    The aforementioned warehouse building and its affiliated assets are the property of our China National Aviation Corporation. As early as December 3, 1949, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of our Central People's Government solemnly declared: "China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation belong to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and are under the direct jurisdiction of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Central People's Government. The assets of the two airlines remaining in Hong Kong can only be disposed of by our Central People's Government and the personnel entrusted by our Central People's Government. No one is allowed to infringe, move, or damage them by any means. This sacred property right of our Central People's Government should be respected by the Hong Kong government."
    In March 1955, the American Sibler Hegner Company, under the direction of American imperialist element Chennault, filed a lawsuit with the Hong Kong High Court, attempting to further seize the aforementioned warehouse property of our China National Aviation Corporation through the Hong Kong High Court. On March 25, our China National Aviation Corporation sent a letter to the British Hong Kong authorities, reiterating Premier Zhou Enlai's statement of December 3, 1949, and requesting the British Hong Kong authorities to immediately take measures to stop this act of infringing upon the property of China National Aviation Corporation.
    However, disregarding the repeated statements of our government and China National Aviation Corporation, the British Hong Kong authorities, through the Hong Kong High Court, illegally ruled that the aforementioned property belonged to the American Sibler Hegner Company. On May 9, they dispatched a large number of armed police officers to forcibly occupy our aforementioned warehouse and its affiliated assets, collaborating with American imperialist element Chennault to once again seize the property of our China National Aviation Corporation in Hong Kong, and assaulted employees, resulting in four injuries. This action by the British Hong Kong authorities is clearly another unreasonable infringement upon our national property in Hong Kong and an unfriendly act towards our country. The Civil Aviation Administration of the People's Republic of China hereby lodges a serious protest with the British Hong Kong authorities and reiterates that the aforementioned warehouse building and its affiliated assets belong to our China National Aviation Corporation and must not be arbitrarily seized by anyone. The British Hong Kong authorities must immediately be responsible for returning the aforementioned warehouse building and its affiliated assets to the personnel of China National Aviation Corporation in Hong Kong for safekeeping and disposal. They must be responsible for compensating for all losses to the company's property and to the injured personnel caused by this unreasonable seizure, and should immediately cease all acts of persecution against our employees of China National Aviation Corporation remaining in Hong Kong. Otherwise, the British Hong Kong authorities must bear all responsibility and all consequences arising therefrom.

　　就香港英当局劫夺我航空公司财产事
　　我国民用航空局代局长发表声明
    新华社十四日讯　中华人民共和国民用航空局王凤梧代局长于一九五五年五月十四日就香港英国当局劫夺我中国航空公司留港财产事，发表声明如下：
    一九五五年五月九日上午十时（香港时间）香港英国当局派遣武装警察四百余人强行侵入属于我中国航空公司所有的香港九龙马头围道中国航空公司仓库（原名庇利船厂），殴打我员工，并于当日下午二时以武力威迫全体员工自该处退出，随后并将上述仓库房屋及其附属资财交与受美帝国主义分子陈纳德指使的美商西伯勒公司“接管”。这是香港英国当局继一九五二年勾结美帝国主义分子非法劫夺我中国航空公司和中央航空公司留在香港的七十一架飞机及其附属资财后，又一次对该两公司在港财产的严重侵犯和无理劫夺的行为。
    查上述仓库房屋及其附属资财系我中国航空公司所有。早在一九四九年十二月三日我中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理即已郑重声明：“中国航空公司和中央航空公司为我中华人民共和国中央人民政府所有，受中央人民政府民航局直接管辖。两航空公司留在香港的资财，只有我中央人民政府和我中央人民政府委托的人员，才有权处置，决不容许任何人以任何手段侵犯、移动或损坏。我中央人民政府的此项神圣的产权，应受到香港政府的尊重。”
    一九五五年三月，受美帝国主义分子陈纳德指使的美商西伯勒公司向香港高等法院提出诉讼，企图假手香港高等法院进一步劫夺我中国航空公司上述仓库房屋财产。三月二十五日我中国航空公司特致函香港英国当局重申周恩来总理一九四九年十二月三日声明，并要求香港英国当局立即采取措施，停止此种侵犯中国航空公司财产的行为。
    但是香港英国当局不顾我国政府和中国航空公司的一再声明，竟由香港高等法院将我上述财产非法判归美商西伯勒公司所有，并于五月九日派出大批武装警察强行侵占我上述仓库及其附属资财，协同美帝国主义分子陈纳德再一次劫夺我中国航空公司在港财产，并殴打员工，致有四人受伤。香港英国当局这一行为显然是又一次对我在港国家财产的无理侵犯和对我国的不友好的行为。中华人民共和国民用航空局兹特向香港英国当局提出严重抗议，并再声明上述仓库房屋及其附属资财系属我中国航空公司所有，不得由任何人随意侵夺。香港英国当局必须立即负责将上述仓库房屋及其附属资财交还中国航空公司在港人员保管和处置，对此次无理侵夺所造成的公司财产和被殴受伤人员的一切损失必须负责赔偿，并应立即停止对我中国航空公司留港员工的一切迫害行为。否则，香港英国当局必须承担由此产生的全部责任和一切后果。
