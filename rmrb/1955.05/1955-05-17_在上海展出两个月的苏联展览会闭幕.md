The Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition, which was held in Shanghai, successfully closed on the 15th after being open for two months.

During the two months of the exhibition, a total of 3,828,000 people visited and learned from it. Regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy, morning or evening, the visitors came and went like a tide. Among the visitors were workers from various factories in Shanghai, government staff, students, suburban farmers, and neighborhood residents, as well as soldiers from the coastal defense front lines. Major cities near Shanghai also organized more than 5,300 professionals in industry, agriculture, transportation, forestry, water conservancy, culture, education, and health to visit and study the exhibition in batches.

During the exhibition, Soviet experts sent by the Soviet government to work at the exhibition widely introduced advanced experience and science and technology to the audience. They held nearly 200 symposiums, reports, and professional lectures with more than 30,000 staff members from industry, agriculture, culture, and science in Shanghai. Soviet experts satisfactorily solved many production technology problems raised by professionals from various places to the exhibition by means of on-site talks, written announcements, and on-site guidance in factories. The exhibition office received several letters of thanks to the experts every day. The exhibition also distributed approximately 400,000 copies of various exhibit sample instructions to relevant production units.

After visiting this large-scale exhibition, people from all walks of life left more than 12,000 comments, expressing their willingness to diligently, humbly, and practically learn from the advanced Soviet experience, implement what they have learned in production, work, and study, and build our motherland like the Soviet Union.

　　在上海展出两个月的苏联展览会闭幕
    在上海展出的苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会已于十五日胜利闭幕。
    这个展览会在展出的整整两个月中，共有三百八十二万八千多人前往参观和学习。不论晴雨，不论早晚，参观的人总是像潮水一样地进进出出。在观众中，有上海各工厂的工人、机关工作人员、学生、市郊农民和里弄居民，也有来自海防前线的战士。上海附近各主要城市还组织了工业、农业、交通运输、森林、水利、文教和卫生等方面的五千三百多名专业人员分批到展览会进行参观和学习。
    在展出期间，苏联政府派来展览会工作的专家们广泛地向观众介绍了先进经验和科学技术。他们和上海市的工业、农业、文化和科学等方面三万多名工作人员举行了近两百次座谈、报告会和专业讲座。苏联专家对各地专业人员向展览会提出的许多生产技术上的问题，都采取现场谈话、书面发布和下厂实地指导等方式给予圆满解决。展览会办公室每天收到好几封给专家的感谢信。展览会还将约四十万份各种展品样本说明书分送给有关的生产单位。
    各界人民在参观这座规模宏大的展览会以后，留下了一万二千多份感想书，他们表示要勤勤恳恳、虚心踏实地学习苏联先进经验，把学到的东西，贯彻到生产、工作和学习中去，把我们的祖国建设得像苏联一样。　（新华社）
