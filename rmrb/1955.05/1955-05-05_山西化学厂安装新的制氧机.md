　　Shanxi Chemical Plant Installs New Oxygen Generator
　　A brand new Hungarian oxygen generator began installation on April 18 in the workshop of the Shanxi Chemical Plant. This machine is designed according to Hungary's most advanced technical standards. It is simple to operate, has a long start-up time, and low material consumption. It is expected to be officially put into production in mid-June. After being put into production, the plant's oxygen production will increase by 50% compared to the present.
　　Oxygen is an important fuel for cutting and welding steel frames and iron plates. With the development of national economic construction, the oxygen produced by the plant is currently in short supply. Orders from various factories, mines, and basic construction departments far exceed the maximum output of existing equipment. For this reason, preparations for installing the new oxygen generator began in February of this year, and workers were organized to learn the technology for operating the new machine. Currently, workers are actively carrying out the installation under the guidance of Hungarian experts.

　  山西化学厂安装新的制氧机
    一部崭新的匈牙利制氧机，四月十八日，在山西化学厂的厂房里开始安装。这部机器是按匈牙利最先进的技术标准设计的，操作简单，开车时间长，材料消耗低，预计六月中旬可正式投入生产。投入生产后，这个厂氧气的产量将比现在增加百分之五十。
    氧气是用来切断和熔接钢架、铁板的重要燃料。随着国家经济建设的发展，目前这个厂所生产的氧气已经供不应求了，各厂矿和基本建设部门的定货，远远超过了现有设备的最高产量。为此，从今年二月份就开始了安装新氧气机的准备工作，并组织职工学习操作新机器的技术。现在，职工们正在匈牙利专家的指导下积极进行安装。
