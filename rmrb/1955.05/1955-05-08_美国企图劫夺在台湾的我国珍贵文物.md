Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The United States is attempting to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to transport our precious cultural relics that were stolen by the Chiang bandits to Taiwan to the United States. According to an Associated Press report, Horace Jayne, the Deputy Director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, published an article in the American magazine "Art News" on the 3rd, "suggesting" that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique "lend" a large portion of our precious cultural relics that were stolen by the Chiang bandits to Taiwan to the United States for a "long period of time." These cultural relics include 6,425 paintings and some extremely valuable bronzes, porcelains, jade articles, lacquerware, goldware, and other items, totaling 70,000 pieces.
