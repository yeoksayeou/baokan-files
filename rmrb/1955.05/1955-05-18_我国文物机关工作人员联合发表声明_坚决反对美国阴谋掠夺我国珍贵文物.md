　　This Newspaper reports: Staff members of the Palace Museum, the Nanjing Museum, and all museums across the country; staff members of the Beijing Library, the Nanjing Library, and all libraries across the country; staff members of the Archaeological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and all archaeological workers across the country; staff members of the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Research Institute and all cultural relics preservation committees across the country; and all archival workers across the country, jointly issued a statement on May 14, firmly opposing the American conspiracy to plunder China's precious cultural relics. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　The American aggressive bloc has long coveted the large number of precious cultural relics and books of our country that were stolen and transported to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Recently, Horace Jayne, the shameless rogue and Deputy Director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the United States, brazenly wrote an article clamoring for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to send these important cultural relics and books to the United States in the form of "long-term loans." He even shamelessly said that this is America's "inescapable international obligation." We unanimously believe that this blatant attempt to plunder the cultural relics and books of another country is an extremely shameless conspiracy, which is not only deeply hated by the 600 million Chinese people, but will also be condemned by the people of the world.

　　Before the liberation of mainland China, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique stole and transported over 5,000 boxes of cultural relics, books, and archives from the former Peiping Palace Museum, the former Preparatory Office of the Central Museum, the former Peiping Library, the former Central Library, the former Academia Sinica, and the former Peiping Research Institute to Taiwan. Taking the museums alone, the former Palace Museum had 2,972 boxes stolen, and the former Central Museum had 852 boxes stolen. These included calligraphy and paintings passed down through generations, porcelain (including all the exhibits that participated in the 1936 London Art Exhibition), Song, Yuan, and Ming rare books, and the Siku Quanshu from the Wenyuan Pavilion; it also included most of the excavations before the Anti-Japanese War, the most important of which were bronzes, jades, pottery, and stone carvings excavated from Anyang, Junxian, Huixian and other places, as well as 25,000 pieces of oracle bone inscriptions unearthed in Anyang.

　　These more than 5,000 boxes of precious cultural relics and books were all preserved in our country's museums, libraries, and research institutes in the past. Every cultural relic has its long history and is loved by the people. Although they were stolen and transported to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the Chinese people must recover them all when liberating Taiwan. In addition, there are still 102 boxes (2,755 kinds) of rare Chinese books and more than 10,000 pieces of Juyan Han bamboo slips in the Library of Congress in the United States. These are all the property of the Chinese people and must be returned.

　　While the American aggressive bloc is occupying our territory of Taiwan, it is wantonly attempting to plunder our cultural relics and books in the form of "long-term loans," which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. We solemnly declare that this conspiracy is extremely despicable and is doomed to failure. The Chinese people's precious cultural relics and books must not be plundered by the American aggressive bloc. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. No matter where these precious cultural relics and books are robbed to, we must recover them all. This is the sacred right and obligation of the Chinese people. We solemnly declare that the American aggressive bloc must bear full responsibility for any damage, shortage, removal, or concealment of all the precious cultural relics and books in our territory of Taiwan.

　　我国文物机关工作人员联合发表声明
　　坚决反对美国阴谋掠夺我国珍贵文物
    本报讯　故宫博物院、南京博物院和全国各博物馆全体工作人员，北京图书馆、南京图书馆和全国各图书馆全体工作人员，中国科学院考古研究所和全国考古工作人员，敦煌文物研究所和全国各地文物保管委员会全体工作人员，以及全国档案工作人员，五月十四日联合发表声明，坚决反对美国掠夺我国珍贵文物的阴谋。声明全文如下：
    美国侵略集团久已垂涎被蒋介石卖国集团盗运到台湾去的我国大批宝贵文物图书，最近居然由无耻流氓美国费城艺术博物馆副馆长霍雷斯·杰尼出面，公开撰文叫嚣，建议蒋介石卖国集团以“长期出借”方式把这些重要文物图书送到美国去。还恬不知耻地说这是美国“不可逃避的国际义务”。我们一致认为，这种公然掠夺别一国家文物图书的罪恶企图，是一种极端无耻的阴谋，不但为中国六亿人民所深恶痛绝，并且一定要受到全世界人民的谴责。
    在中国大陆解放前夕，蒋介石卖国集团就把前北平故宫博物院、前中央博物院筹备处、前北平图书馆、前中央图书馆、前中央研究院和前北平研究院的文物和图书以及档案共五千箱以上盗运到台湾。仅以博物院来说，前故宫博物院就被盗去二千九百七十二箱，前中央博物院就被盗去八百五十二箱。其中包括历代相传的书画、瓷器（其中包括曾参加一九三六年伦敦艺术展览会的全部展品），宋、元、明善本书籍和文渊阁四库全书；也包括了抗日战争前大部分的发掘品，最重要的是全部安阳、浚县、辉县等地发掘出来的铜器、玉器、陶器、石刻等，以及安阳出土的二万五千片刻辞甲骨。
    这五千箱以上的珍贵文物图书，过去都保藏在我国的博物院、图书馆和研究所里。每一件文物都有它悠久的历史，并为人民大众所热爱。它们尽管被蒋介石卖国集团盗运到台湾，但中国人民在解放台湾时一定要全部收回。除此以外，还有至今尚在美国国会图书馆的我国善本书一百零二箱（二千七百五十五种）和居延汉简一万余片，这些都是属于中国人民的财产，必须交回。
    美国侵略集团在侵占我国领土台湾的同时，竟肆无忌惮地企图以“长期出借”的形式来掠夺我们的文物图书，这是我国人民所绝对不能容忍的。我们郑重宣告：这种阴谋是极端卑鄙的，是注定要失败的。中国人民的宝贵文物图书，绝对不许美国侵略集团掠夺。中国人民一定要解放台湾。这批宝贵的文物图书，不论被劫夺到天涯海角，我们一定要全数把它追回来。这是我国人民的神圣权利和义务。我们严正声明，现在我们领土台湾的全部珍贵文物图书倘有丝毫损伤短少、挪移及隐匿，必须由美国侵略集团负全部责任。
