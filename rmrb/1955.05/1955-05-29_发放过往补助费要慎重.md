To the Editor:

　　Regarding the issuance of past subsidies:

　　On March 25th, Zheng Fengliang, a young farmer from Caolaihaigou Village, Tenth District, Ningcheng County, Rehe Province, arrived in Mulan County under the pretext of seeking relatives and finding work. After our detailed investigation, we learned that he had actually run away from home because he was unwilling to engage in agricultural labor in the countryside. Along the way, he requested subsidies for travel expenses from government departments in Jinzhou, Shenyang, Harbin, Bayan, and other places, amounting to about 15 yuan. According to statistics, from March 12th to 25th, a total of 23 people passed through Mulan from Bayan to Tonghe requesting travel subsidies. Most of them were young farmers from Rehe and Shandong provinces. This situation shows that the local governments have not earnestly implemented the policy of dissuading farmers from blindly going out, and some government agencies along the transportation routes have not earnestly educated them, but simply issued them some travel expenses. This not only wastes the wealth of the country but also encourages some people who are unwilling to work to blindly drift. Therefore, I suggest that the civil affairs departments in various places should be very cautious when issuing travel subsidies to avoid increasing unnecessary expenditures for the country.

### 发放过往补助费要慎重

　  发放过往补助费要慎重编辑同志：
    热河省宁城县第十区曹来海沟屯青年农民郑凤良于三月二十五日到木兰县境内，借寻亲为名找工作。经我们详细考察，才知道他原来是因为不愿在农村里从事农业劳动，从家里溜出来的。一路上他向锦州、沈阳、哈尔滨、巴彦等地人民政府部门要求补助了过路费十五元左右。据统计，从三月十二日到二十五日十四天当中，从巴彦去通河路过木兰要求补助过路费的共有二十三人，他们多数是从热河、山东两省来的青年农民。这种情况，说明了当地政府没有认真执行劝止农民盲目外出的政策，而交通沿线的某些政府机关也没有认真地向他们进行教育，只是简单地发给他们一些路费了事。这样，不但浪费了国家的财富，而且助长了某些不愿劳动的人盲目外流。因此，我建议各地民政部门发放补助路费时要十分慎重，不要给国家增加不必要的开支。
