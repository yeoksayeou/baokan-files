Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th: Dozens of capital construction units in Zhengzhou City, after revising their construction plans for this year, have saved funds equivalent to 17% of the original national planned investment for this year. In terms of industrial construction, following the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory's revision of its plan, which saved the state more than 5.3 million yuan, the Zhengzhou Waterworks also adjusted its basic construction plan, which can save 3.5 million yuan in investment. The Zhengzhou Flour Mill removed all the so-called national-style patterns on the outside of the main factory building and auxiliary buildings, which also saved a lot of money. The state originally requested that the Yellow River Conservancy Commission's office building project reduce its investment by 10% to 20% from the original plan, but after careful research by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the reduction in investment accounted for more than half of the original plan. The originally planned construction of primary schools and nurseries for employees' children was decided not to be built, considering that there were nearby primary schools and nurseries that could be utilized. After the Henan Hotel reduced all of this year's newly added projects and high-ranking cadre guesthouses, a total of 1.03 million yuan was saved. The Henan Provincial People's Committee canceled the originally planned construction of a large auditorium and allocated the money to Zhengzhou's directly affiliated agencies for construction, which also reduced the state's investment in Zhengzhou's agency buildings.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, Despatch: The newly built Collection (Ning) - Erlian (Line) project modified some extravagant and unreasonable designs, saving the state investment of more than 2.7 million yuan. The originally designed Jining North Station building was a building that pursued form and neglected economic principles. The floor and the reinforced concrete columns of the station hall were all finished with high-grade terrazzo and marble. There were also three large colored spines on the top of the building, and many places were to be inlaid with gold. The new design reduced investment by more than 1.5 million yuan because it eliminated these extravagant projects. A cargo warehouse at Jining North Station reduced the capacity of the original design according to actual needs, and the cost can be reduced from 1.2 million yuan to 270,000 yuan. The Erlian Station changed the original Temple of Heaven-style roof to a one-story building with a round arch, which not only does not affect the appearance but also reduces investment and increases the usable area by more than 1,000 square meters.

The construction department of the Collection-Erlian Line actively participated in the improvement of the original design. From January to now, they have put forward a total of 530 suggestions for improving the design. Among them, the suggestion to change the riveted steel roof truss of the Jining Locomotive Depot garage in the original design to a foam concrete electric welded roof truss can save 30% of steel after implementation.

　　郑州建设单位修订计划节约资金
　  集二线修改不合理设计节省二百多万元
    新华社郑州四日电　在郑州市进行建设的几十个基本建设单位，修订今年建设计划后节省出的资金，相当于今年原国家计划投资总数的百分之十七。在工业建设方面，继国营郑州第四棉纺织厂修订计划为国家节省五百三十多万元的资金后，郑州市自来水厂也把基本建设计划作了调整，可以节省投资三百五十万元。郑州面粉厂把主厂房和附属建筑物外边的所谓民族形式的花纹全部去掉，省出的钱也不少。本来国家要求黄河水利委员会机关建筑工程在原计划上削减百分之十到二十的投资，后来经过黄河水利委员会认真研究，削减的投资占原计划数的一半以上。原计划准备建设的职工子弟小学和托儿所，由于考虑到附近有小学校和托儿站可以利用，就决定不再建设了。河南饭店把今年增建的工程和高级干部招待所全部削减了以后，共节省一百零三万元。河南省人民委员会取消了原计划建设的大礼堂，并把这笔钱拨给郑州市直属机关进行建设，也减少了国家对郑州市机关建筑的投资。
    据新华社呼和浩特电　集（宁）二（连）线新建工程中修改了某些奢华和不合理的设计，节省国家投资二百七十多万元。原来设计的集宁北站大楼是一座追求形式忽视经济原则的建筑物。它的地坪和车站大厅的钢筋混凝土柱子，都是用高级水磨石和大理石抹面，大楼上面并有三个很大的彩色垂脊，许多地方要用金子镶面。新的设计因为取消了这些奢华的项目，投资就减少了一百五十多万元。集宁北站的一个货物仓库，根据实际需要缩小了原设计的容量，造价可由一百二十万元减少到二十七万元。二连车站把原来天坛式的大顶改为一层楼房的圆拱，不但不影响美观，还减少了投资，并且增加了一千多平方公尺的使用面积。
    集二线的施工部门，积极参加了原设计的改善工作。从一月份到现在，他们提出改进设计的建议共有五百三十件，其中关于原设计的集宁机务段车库铆接钢屋架改为泡沫混凝土电焊屋架的建议，实行后就可节省百分之三十的钢材。
