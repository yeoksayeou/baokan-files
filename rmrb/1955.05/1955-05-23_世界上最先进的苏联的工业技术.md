The World's Most Advanced Soviet Industrial Technology
    New Hydraulic Coal Mining Method Being Promoted in Coal Mining Industry

    The Soviet coal mining industry is promoting a new hydraulic coal mining method. Using this method can reduce coal mining costs by one-half to one-third. This method mainly uses hydraulic machinery to spray strong water jets to wash down the coal seam, and then uses water pumps to send the coal-water mixture to the mineral processing plant for dehydration, drying and other processing work.
    According to the results of applying the hydraulic coal mining method in the "Tilgansky Ukon" and "North Polysaevsky" mines in the Kuznetsk coal region of Siberia, labor productivity is one and a half to two times higher than that of the most highly mechanized mines currently. The quality of coal mined by this method is very high, and the consumption of materials, especially wood, is greatly reduced during mining. Generally, three to four tons of water can be used to mine one ton of coal, and the water can be continuously recycled. At the same time, due to the simplification of the technological process, the production capacity of the mine has been greatly improved.
    Currently, many coal mining areas across the Soviet Union have decided to adopt this advanced coal mining method. More than 20 mines and open-pit coal mines that use the hydraulic coal mining method completely are now under construction in the Donets Basin, Karaganda, Moscow Coal Region, and Central Asia. Several of them will be put into production in the near future. It is estimated that by 1956, the amount of coal mined by hydraulic coal mining method in the Soviet Union will almost double that of 1955.

    Mechanized Construction Using Large Blocks

    On the newly built Stalin Avenue in Leningrad, thirteen buildings have quickly sprung up. These buildings rise one story every five to eight days on average, while no more than ten people participate in the construction project of each building. This is one of the many construction sites in Leningrad that use large blocks for mechanized construction.
    This year, Leningrad's projects using large blocks are one-third more than last year. More than 500 houses are under construction in the city, and 95 percent of them will be built with prefabricated concrete components. After using large blocks, the construction speed will be three to four times faster than in 1950 on average, and the cost will be 10 percent cheaper than using general construction methods.
    In terms of developing mechanized construction, Leningrad's construction workers have also made great progress. The number of machines on construction sites here has increased by about one-fifth in the past year. Construction workers have adopted more than 1,500 newly created machines and equipment in one year. As a result of using these machines and equipment, about 20 million rubles in construction costs can be saved this year.

    New "Volga" Cars Being Tested

    Recently, a new type of "Volga" car is being tested on the journey from Gorky City to Moscow and other cities in the Soviet Union.
    This new car is manufactured by the Molotov Automobile Factory in Gorky City. It has five seats and is equipped with a 70-horsepower engine. The highest driving speed per hour can reach 130 kilometers. This car is also equipped with excellent hydraulic automatic transmission and hydraulic brakes, which can switch to the appropriate speed at any time and place and ensure driving safety.
    The body of this car is more beautiful and more economical than the "Victory" car originally manufactured by the Molotov Automobile Factory. The Molotov Automobile Factory will produce this new car in large quantities to replace the original "Victory" car.
    During the test, this car will run more than 8,000 kilometers on roads and mountains together with "Victory," "Zim," the latest Ford and Chevrolet cars to compare their advantages and disadvantages.

    世界上最先进的苏联的工业技术
    煤矿工业正在推广新的水力采煤法
    苏联煤矿工业正在推广新的水力采煤法。使用这种方法，可使采煤的成本降低二分之一到三分之一。这种方法主要是利用水力机喷射强力的水流冲下煤层，再用水泵把这种煤水混合物送进选矿工厂，进行脱水、干燥等加工工作。
    根据西伯利亚库兹涅茨克煤区的“蒂尔干斯基乌科尼”和“北波利萨耶夫斯基”两个矿场应用水力采煤法的结果，劳动生产率比目前最高度机械化的矿场还要高一倍半到两倍。用这种方法所采的煤的质量很高，采煤时材料的耗费，特别是木材的耗费也大大地减少。一般用三四吨水就可以采一吨煤，而且水还可以循环不断地利用。同时，由于技术过程的简化，矿场的生产能力提高了许多。
    目前，苏联全国许多煤矿区都决定采用这种先进的采煤方法。顿尼兹煤区、卡拉干达、莫斯科煤区和中亚细亚现在正在建设二十多个完全使用水力采煤法的矿井和露天采煤场。其中有几个将在最近期内投入生产。预计到一九五六年，全苏联用水力采煤法开采的煤将比一九五五年几乎增加一倍。
    利用大型砌块进行机械化施工
    在列宁格勒新建的斯大林大道上，有十三座大楼很快地耸立起来。这些大楼平均五天到八天的时间就升高一层，而参加每座大楼建筑工程的却不出十个人。这就是列宁格勒许多利用大型砌块进行机械化施工的建筑工地之一。
    今年列宁格勒利用大型砌块的工程比去年多三分之一。全市有五百多幢房屋正在兴建，其中有百分之九十五的房屋都将用装配式混凝土构件建筑。利用大型砌块后，建筑速度平均将比一九五零年快三、四倍，造价比用一般建筑方法便宜百分之十。
    在发展机械化施工方面，列宁格勒的建筑工作者也获得了很大进展。这里建筑工地上的机器最近一年增加了约五分之一。建筑工作者在一年中采用了一千五百多种新创造的机器和设备。使用这些机械和设备的结果，今年可以节省建筑费约两千万卢布。
    新式的“伏尔加牌”汽车正进行试验
    最近，一种新式的“伏尔加”牌汽车，正在苏联高尔基城到莫斯科和其他城市的旅途上进行试验。
    这种新式汽车是高尔基城莫洛托夫汽车工厂制造的。它共有五个座位，装着七十匹马力的发动机，每小时最高的行驶速率可以达到一百三十公里。这种汽车还装有优良的液压自动变速器和液压制动器，可以随时随地转换适当的速度和保证行车安全。
    这种汽车的车身比莫洛托夫汽车工厂原来制造的“胜利”牌汽车更加美观，更加经济，莫洛托夫汽车工厂将大量生产这种新式的汽车，以代替原来的“胜利”牌汽车。
    在进行试验时，将把这种汽车同“胜利”牌、
  “齐姆”式、最新式的福特汽车和雪佛莱汽车一起，在公路和山路上跑八千多公里，以比较优劣。
