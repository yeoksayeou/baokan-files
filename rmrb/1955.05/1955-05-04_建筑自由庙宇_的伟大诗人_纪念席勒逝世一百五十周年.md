　　The Great Poet Who "Built the Temple of Freedom"
　　——Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of Schiller's Death
　　Feng Zhi
　　May 9th of this year marks the 150th anniversary of the death of the German poet Schiller. The World Peace Council has called on peace-loving people around the world to commemorate this great poet. The German Democratic Republic has named the entire year of 1955 after Schiller, calling it "Schiller Year." In his short life of less than forty-six years, Schiller created more than a dozen brilliant plays and some immortal poems, enriching the German and world literary treasuries. Through these works, we recognize Schiller as a poet who opposed tyranny, opposed war, loved his country, and held lofty ideals for the future of mankind.
　　Schiller was born on November 10, 1759, in a small town called Marbach within the Duchy of Württemberg. His father was a surgeon, later a junior officer in the Duke's army, and his mother was the daughter of a baker. At that time, Germany was divided into three hundred feudal states. Economic backwardness and political division hindered the development of productive forces, making it impossible to form a unified national state. The rulers of these feudal states were all tyrants, who internally sucked the blood and sweat of the people without limit, and externally sold out national interests without scruple. Regarding this situation, Engels gave a very vivid description: "Commerce, industry, and agriculture were all in decline; peasants, merchants, and factory owners felt the double oppression of bloodsucking government and commercial depression; nobles and dukes felt that their income, though squeezing their subjects dry, was still endlessly insufficient for their ever-increasing expenses; everything was upside down; the whole country was full of complaints. There was no education, no means of influencing the masses' thinking, no freedom of the press, no civic consciousness, no extensive foreign trade—only triviality and selfishness—a trivial, servile, and pathetic petty business operation dominated the entire people..." In such a state, Engels continued, "domestic literature offered the only hope of improvement. This politically and economically miserable century was also the great century of German literature. ... Every outstanding work of this era breathed the spirit of challenge and resistance to the entire German society that existed at that time. Goethe wrote his 'Götz von Berlichingen,' a drama respecting the rebels. Schiller wrote his 'The Robbers,' a praise for a frank and open young man who openly declared war on the whole society..."
　　"The Robbers" was Schiller's first successful work. Schiller began writing this play when he was only eighteen years old, while being forced to study in a military academy. This school was an institution for the Duke of Württemberg to manufacture slaves. Students had no freedom and were subjected to cruel and inhumane training and supervision. Young Schiller was imprisoned there for eight years from 1773 to 1780. However, the school's strict rules could not stop the young man's demand and desire for freedom, and the school's iron gates could not prevent the spread of the works of Rousseau, Shakespeare, Goethe, and some "Storm and Stress" poets. Schiller enthusiastically read them and devoted himself to writing poetry and plays. After graduating, he worked as a military doctor in the Duke's army. The following year, 1781, "The Robbers" was published. The first page of the play clearly states the famous words of the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates:
　　"What medicine does not cure, iron cures; what iron does not cure, fire cures." When it was republished, the author added the inscription "Against the Tyrants" in Latin on the cover. The protagonist Karl Moor is a pure and excellent young man, and the corruption of the society around him prompts him to become a robber; he comprehensively attacks the feudal society, unreasonable laws, and hypocritical religion of the time. This kind of resistance is spontaneous, without a clear goal, and cannot see the way out in the future, because a broader prospect cannot yet be presented in the eyes of the young Schiller and the "Storm and Stress" poets who were generally dissatisfied with the status quo at that time. But this play fully expresses what some people at the time wanted to say in their hearts.
　　Soon, "The Robbers" was staged at the Mannheim Theater, which did not belong to the Duchy of Württemberg, and was warmly welcomed by the masses. Because Schiller participated in the performance without obtaining his permission, the Duke detained him for two weeks and forbade him from writing. Schiller could no longer tolerate the Duke's various oppressions, and secretly left the capital of Württemberg in September 1782, and fled to "foreign countries." Since then, he traveled between Mannheim and Frankfurt on the Rhine, working as a playwright for the theater. During this period, he completed two plays: "Fiesco" and "Intrigue and Love." "Fiesco" narrates the contradictions between the feudal forces and the emerging bourgeoisie in Italy in the 16th century; "Intrigue and Love," however, is based on modern times, clearly exposing the conspiracy and shamelessness of the feudal ruling class, and creating simple, upright figures with lofty ideals in an ordinary musician and his daughter. Engels said in a letter to Minna Kautsky that the "main value" of this play "lies in the fact that it is the first German drama with political tendencies." The situation in Württemberg at that time was exactly the same as that described by Engels in Germany. The rulers lived licentious lives, and resorted to various shameless conspiracies to satisfy their personal desires, while being weak and incompetent politically. The Duke often sold tens of thousands of young people to France and the Netherlands to serve as soldiers, in exchange for money to entertain his court and buy jewels for his mistresses. He sent his henchmen everywhere to forcibly conscript soldiers, and those who were caught were massacred if they resisted slightly. Schiller exposed this crime in "Intrigue and Love" and presented it to a wide audience. The author lets the musician's daughter Louise cry out loudly, accuse the people, and express her wishes for the future of mankind: the restrictions of rank must collapse, the hateful shells of class must be broken, and people are all people!
　　When the French Revolution broke out in 1789, Schiller had already been introduced by Goethe to serve as an unpaid professor of history at the University of Jena. His main work was then concentrated on historical research. "History of the Netherlands' Secession from Spanish Rule" and "History of the Thirty Years' War in Germany" were completed at this time. The objects of his research were all periods of national critical moments in history; he saw that no matter how chaotic and dark the era, there was always a bright side, and the people who fought for justice were invincible.
　　Here we must point out that at the same time as the French Revolution was rising, Schiller had a period (1791-1795) to hide in the idealist world of Kant. When the revolution broke out, many German thinkers and poets felt excited and expressed their welcome, but the rapid development of the revolution and the rule of the Jacobins made them lose their understanding of the revolution, and turned from welcome to fear. This was determined by the incompetence of the German bourgeoisie and the backwardness of politics and economy. The fire-like and enthusiastic Schiller at this time "escaped to Kant's ideal" (Engels), detached himself from reality, and believed that if human freedom was to be realized, it should not be done by revolutionary means, but through the "kingdom of beautiful illusion." At this time, he wrote a series of idealist aesthetic papers, which presented a sharp contradiction compared with his realism in literary practice. Goethe once talked about Schiller, saying very pertinently: "It is very sad to see how a man of such great talent torments himself with philosophical thinking that does not help him. As soon as Schiller stops philosophy, his style works very brilliantly." The "philosophy" mentioned here is the idealism that is divorced from reality.
　　But the suffering of reality and his specific tasks as a poet did not allow him to stay in the "kingdom of beautiful illusion" for a long time. The state of division in Germany had not improved, and the development of British industry and the expansion of people's power after the French Revolution had strengthened the German people's desire for unity. Napoleon's gradual rise to power and the occupation of the left bank of the Rhine River by France in 1797 further stimulated the awakening of the German people's national consciousness. All of this was enough to enable Schiller to overcome his idealistic aesthetic views, "stop philosophy," draw materials from vivid history, and write his great historical plays in the final stage: "Wallenstein" (1799), which was taken from the Thirty Years' War and embodied the requirements for national unity, "The Maid of Orleans" (1801), which resisted the British army during the Hundred Years' War between England and France, and "William Tell" (1804), a national hero in the 14th-century Swiss legend who resisted the rule of the Habsburg dynasty. In these historical plays, he not only expressed the current German people's desire for unity and resistance to aggression, but also inspired the German people with vivid images and passionate language.
　　Striving for national unity and resisting foreign aggression and rule are inseparable from opposing war and striving for peace. In "Wallenstein," especially in the first part, "Wallenstein's Camp," Schiller profoundly depicts the tragic scenes of war. Joan of Arc, the Maid of Orleans, also issued a stern reprimand to the British invaders: "You remind me how many mothers in this country have lost their children, how many weak children have lost their fathers, and how many fiancées have become widows, all because of you! Now English mothers must also taste this desperate pain and recognize the tears cried out by the sad wives of France." This is an accusation of war.
　　Schiller also spoke out the greatness of the people's power in these plays. During the Hundred Years' War, the British invaders penetrated deep into the French mainland, and the French rulers and their armies were unable to resist. Half of the country was lost. When a shepherdess, Joan of Arc, put down her shepherd's staff, picked up her weapon, united the people, and launched a counterattack against the invaders, the enemy retreated steadily and collapsed at the mere sight of them. In "William Tell," we read more about the praise of the people. What appears here are the working people, who tell how they have opened up the mountains and forests and worked diligently in farming, but the fruits of their labor have been plundered by foreign rulers, and their lives and property have been arbitrarily slaughtered. At the same time, they realize that as long as they unite, "the ground under the tyrant's feet will be empty."
　　Schiller died in Weimar on May 9, 1805, the year after this play was completed. Not long after his death, Napoleon launched a large-scale offensive against the German nation. Schiller's works immediately played a great inspirational role for German youth, arousing their patriotism and actively participating in the anti-Napoleon wars of liberation. His slogan of "resistance to tyrants," as the German Marxist Mehring pointed out in "German History," has permanently resonated in the German labor movement, and German workers have taken this slogan as their own. Now, in Schiller's homeland, there is already a part of the region—the German Democratic Republic—which, under the leadership of the working-class party, has realized Schiller's dream and permanently eliminated tyrannical rule and unreasonable social systems. But the situation in West Germany is completely different. It is still similar to Schiller's time. Under the rule of the Adenauer reactionary government, everything is under the direction of US imperialism. Militarism is being restored, fascism is being revived, young people are being forced to serve as cannon fodder, German unification is being hindered, and international peace is being undermined. What Schiller attacked and accused in those years has not only not disappeared, but has become even more vicious. The German people are commemorating Schiller on a large scale now precisely because Schiller's works have extremely rich practical significance and educational significance for the current Germany.
　　Heine once said, "Schiller wrote for the great ideals of the revolution; he destroyed the Bastille prison of the spirit, he built the temple of freedom, he built the great temple that unites all nations into a single brotherhood." Now peace-loving and progressive people all over the world are jointly commemorating Schiller precisely because what he loved is what we love, and what he hated is what we hate. His construction of this great "temple of freedom" is consistent with our current struggle to defend international peace and develop the cause of human progress. (Attached picture)

　　“建筑自由庙宇”的伟大诗人
　　——纪念席勒逝世一百五十周年
　　冯至
    今年五月九日，是德国诗人席勒逝世一百五十周年的纪念日。世界和平理事会号召全世界爱好和平的人民纪念这个伟大的诗人，德意志民主共和国把一九五五年全年都冠上席勒的名字，叫作“席勒年”。席勒在他不满四十六岁短短的一生内创作了十几部辉煌的剧本和一些不朽的诗篇，丰富了德国的和世界的文学宝库。通过这些作品，我们认识席勒是一个反抗暴政、反对战争、热爱祖国、对于人类将来抱有崇高理想的诗人。
    席勒于一七五九年十一月十日生在威登堡公爵领域内叫作马尔巴赫的小城里。父亲是个外科医生，后来在公爵军队里做小军官，母亲是一个面包师的女儿。当时德国分裂为三百个封建小邦，经济的落后和政治的分割阻碍着生产力的发展，不可能组成一个民族统一的国家。这些封建小邦的统治者每个人都是一个暴君，对内无限制地吸饮人民的血汗，对外则毫无顾忌地出卖民族利益。关于这个情况，恩格斯有过一段极生动的叙述：“商业、工业和农业都凋零殆尽；农民、商人和工厂主都感到吸血政府和商业凋蔽的双重压迫；贵族和公侯们觉得他们的收入虽然榨尽他们的臣民还是随着日见增长的支出永无止境；一切都是颠倒的；全国怨声载道。没有教育，没有影响群众思想的工具，没有出版自由，没有市民意识，没有较为广大的对外贸易——只有琐屑和自私——一种琐屑的、卑屈的、可怜的小利经营支配着全体人民。……”在这样状态里，恩格斯继续写道，“国内的文学提供出唯一的改善希望。这个政治上、经济上可悲的世纪同时是德国文学的伟大的世纪。……这时代每个杰出的作品都呼吸着向当时存在的整个德国社会的挑战和反抗的精神。歌德写他的‘葛慈·封·白利星根’，是一部尊敬反抗者的戏剧。席勒写他的‘强盗’，是对于一个向全社会公开宣战的、胸怀磊落的青年的赞颂。……”
      “强盗”是席勒第一部成功的作品，席勒起始写这剧本时，才十八岁，正被迫在一个士官学校里读书。这学校是威登堡公爵制造奴仆的机关，学生没有自由，受着残酷的、非人道的训练和监督，年轻的席勒从一七七三到一七八○年在里边禁锢了八年之久。可是学校严格的规条遏止不住年轻人自由的要求和愿望，学校的铁门阻挡不住卢骚、莎士比亚、歌德和一些“狂飙突击”诗人的作品的传播，席勒热情地阅读它们，自己也从事于诗和剧本的写作。他毕业后，在公爵的军队里做军医，第二年，一七八一年，“强盗”出版了。这剧本的第一页很明显地写着希腊古代名医希波克拉特斯的名言：
  “药不治者，铁治之；铁不治者，火治之。”它再版时作者又在封面上添上用拉丁文写的“反抗暴君们”的铭语。剧本里的主角卡尔·摩尔是一个纯洁、优良的青年，他周围社会的腐朽促使他成为强盗；他对于当时的封建社会，不合理的法律和虚伪的宗教进行了全面的攻击。这种反抗是自发的，没有明确的目标，看不清将来的出路，因为在青年席勒的、以及当时一般不满现状的“狂飙突击”诗人的眼界前还不能呈现出更为广大的远景。但是这剧本却充分地发泄出当时一些人心里要说的话。
    不久，“强盗”在不属于威登堡公爵领域的曼海木的剧院上演，受到群众热烈的欢迎。公爵因为席勒没有得到他的允许便参加了演出，把他拘禁了两个星期，并且禁止他从事写作；席勒再也不能忍受公爵的种种压迫，在一七八二年九月偷偷地离开威登堡首都，逃亡到“外国”。从此他就往来于曼海木和莱茵河畔的佛朗克府一带，充作剧院的剧本作者。在这期间内他完成了两个剧本：“费斯科”和“阴谋与爱情”。“费斯科”叙述十六世纪意大利封建势力和新兴资产阶级的矛盾；“阴谋与爱情”却是取材现代，明确地揭露封建统治阶级的阴谋无耻，并且在一个普通的音乐师和他的女儿身上创造出朴素、梗直、具有崇高理想的人物形象。恩格斯在给明娜·考斯基的信里说，这个剧本的“主要价值就是在于它是第一部德国的有政治倾向的戏剧”。当时的威登堡和恩格斯所写的德国情况完全一样，统治者过着淫乱的生活，为了满足个人的私欲不惜采用种种无耻的阴谋，而在政治上则懦弱无能。公爵常常把成千上万的青年卖给法国和荷兰充当兵役，换回来钱做为他宫廷取乐、给情妇买宝石的费用。他派遣他的爪牙到处抓壮丁，被抓的人略有违抗，就遭到屠杀。这种罪行，席勒在“阴谋与爱情”里给以揭露，提供在广大观众的面前。作者让音乐师的女儿绿意斯大声疾呼，替人民控诉，并且说出对于人类将来的愿望：等级的限制都要倒塌，阶级的可恨的皮壳都要破裂，人都是人！
    一七八九年法国革命爆发时，席勒已由歌德介绍在耶那大学担任没有工资的历史教授。他的主要工作于是集中在历史研究上边。“尼德兰脱离西班牙统治的历史”、“德国三十年战争史”都是在这时完成的。他研究的对象，都是历史上民族紧要关头的时期；他看出无论多么紊乱黑暗的时代，总有光明的一面，而且为正义斗争的人民是不可战胜的。
    这里我们必须指出，在法国大革命高涨的同时，席勒却有一个时期（一七九一——一七九五）躲入康德的唯心主义的世界。革命爆发时，许多德国的思想家和诗人都感到兴奋，表示欢迎，但是革命的急剧发展，雅各宾党人的执政，却使他们对于革命失却了理解力，从欢迎转为畏惧，这是德国资产阶级的无能和政治经济的落后决定的。火一般热情的席勒到这时却“逃向康德的理想”（恩格斯语），脱离现实，认为若是实现人类的自由，不应用革命手段，却要通过“美的假象的王国”。这时他写出一系列唯心主义美学的论文，这些论文和他在文学实践中的现实主义相对照，呈现出尖锐的矛盾。歌德有一次谈到席勒，说得非常中肯：“这是非常使人感到可悲的，当我们看到一个这样非常有才能的人怎样在那些无助于他的哲学思维上自寻苦恼。席勒一停止了哲学，他的风格就非常辉煌地起着作用”。这里所说的“哲学”，就是那脱离现实的唯心主义。
    但现实的苦难和他作为一个诗人的具体任务不容许他长期逗留在“美的假象的王国”里。德国的分裂状态没有改善，而英国工业的发展和法国革命后人民力量的膨胀都加强德国人民对于统一的渴望，拿破仑的逐渐得势和一七九七年莱茵河左岸被法国的占领更刺激德国人民民族意识的觉醒。这都足以使席勒克服他唯心主义的美学观点，“停止了哲学”，从生动的历史里取材，写出他最后阶段的伟大的历史剧本：取材于三十年战争体现民族统一要求的“华伦斯太”（一七九九年）、英法百年战争时期抵抗英军的“奥里昂女郎”（一八○一年）、十四世纪瑞士传说中反抗哈布斯堡王朝统治的民族英雄“威廉·退尔”（一八○四年）。他在这些历史剧本里不只是表达了当前德国人民要求统一、抵制侵略的愿望，而且也用生动的形象和热情的语言鼓舞了德国的人民。
    争取民族统一，反抗异族的侵略与统治是和反对战争，争取和平分不开的。席勒在“华伦斯太”里，尤其是在它的第一部“华伦斯太之阵营”里，深刻地描画出战争凄惨的景象。奥里昂的女郎约翰娜也向英国的侵略者发出辞严义正的申斥：“你使我想起，这国土有多少母亲失却儿童，多少幼弱的儿童失却父亲，多少未婚妻成为孀妇，这都是由于你们！如今英国的母亲也要尝一尝这绝望的痛苦，认识法国悲凉的妻子们哭出的眼泪。”这是对于战争的控诉。
    席勒在这些剧本里也说出来人民力量的伟大。百年战争时英国侵略者深入法国内地，法国的统治者和他们的军队无法抵御，国土失却一半，等到一个牧羊女约翰娜放下了牧杖，拿起武器，团结人民，向侵略者反攻时，敌人就节节后退，望风披靡。在“威廉·退尔”里我们在更多的地方读到对于人民的歌颂，这里出现的都是劳动人民，他们诉说他们是怎样开辟山林，勤于耕种，而他们劳动的果实却被外来的统治者掠去，他们的生命财产，被人任意宰割，同时他们认识到，只要团结起来，“暴君脚底下的地便空了”。
    这剧本完成后的次年，一八○五年五月九日，席勒便在魏玛逝世了。他死后不久，拿破仑便向德国民族展开大规模的进攻，席勒的作品立即对于德国青年起了极大的鼓舞作用，唤起他们爱国主义精神，去积极地参加反拿破仑的自由战争。他的“反抗暴君”的口号，正像德国的马克思主义者梅林在
  “德国历史”里所指出来的，在德国的工人运动中永久得到回响，德国工人把这口号当作自己的口号。现在，在席勒的祖国，已经有一部分地域——德意志民主共和国——在工人阶级政党的领导下，实现了席勒的梦想，永久削除了暴君统治和不合理的社会制度。但是在西德却完全是两样，还和席勒的时代相似，在阿登纳反动政府的统治下，一切都听从美帝国主义的指使，恢复军国主义，使法西斯主义复活，迫令青年充当炮灰，阻碍德国统一，破坏国际和平，当年席勒所攻击，所控诉的，不但还没消逝，而且面貌更为狞恶了。现在德国人民大规模地纪念席勒，正因为席勒的著作对于当前的德国有极丰富的现实意义和教育意义。
    海涅曾经说过，“席勒为革命的伟大理想而写作；他摧毁精神的巴士梯尔监狱，他建筑自由庙宇，他建筑那个把各民族团结为一个唯一的兄弟集体的伟大的庙宇”。现在全世界爱好和平的进步人类共同纪念席勒，正是因为他所爱的正是我们所爱的，他憎恨的也是我们所憎恨的，他对于这伟大的
  “自由庙宇”的建筑和我们现在为保卫国际和平和发展人类进步事业所进行的斗争是一致的。（附图片）
