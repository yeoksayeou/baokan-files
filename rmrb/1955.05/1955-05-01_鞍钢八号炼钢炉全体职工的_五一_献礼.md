The workers of No. 8 Open Hearth Furnace in the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant, used the method of rapid steelmaking to produce 40 heats of steel in the first three months of this year. The average time for smelting one heat of steel was shortened by 16 minutes compared with the state plan, thus completing the first quarter's production plan four days ahead of schedule. In April, they strived to complete the entire month's production task three days ahead of schedule, guaranteeing more than 1,000 tons of steel production than originally planned, as their gift to this year's "May Day" festival.

No. 8 Open Hearth Furnace was named as Anshan Iron and Steel's model open hearth furnace for 1954. In 1954, the workers of No. 8 Open Hearth Furnace comprehensively overfulfilled the state production plan. The output increased by 1.45 percent compared with 1953, the quality increased by 1.05 percent compared with 1953, the furnace breakdown rate reached 6.1 percent, a decrease of 2.3 percent compared with the plan, and costs were reduced by 75,800 yuan. In 1954, the workers of No. 8 furnace used the method of rapid steelmaking to produce 94 heats of steel, creating a new record of 7.55 minutes to smelt one heat of steel, producing an additional 8,500 tons of steel for the country.

The workers of No. 8 furnace were able to achieve the above results mainly because they actively and diligently improved their technology with the help of the Party and Soviet experts. In their practical work, they deeply experienced that rapid steelmaking is the best way to complete and overfulfill production tasks. Because the smelting time is shortened, the amount of steel produced each month, each quarter, and each year will increase. According to regulations, the time for them to produce a heat of steel is 11 hours and 5 minutes, and the time for rapid steelmaking to produce a heat of steel is 10 hours. If more than one hour can be reduced for each heat of steel, more than five heats of steel can be produced in a month, and more than sixty heats of steel can be produced in a year.

Rapid steelmaking is a collective and creative labor, requiring the unity of workers in three shifts and close coordination between various sections. Without this condition, rapid steelmaking is impossible. There are more than 20 workers in the three shifts of No. 8 furnace. Often, one shift loads and smelts, and the next shift taps the steel. Poor operation in the previous shift will affect the steel tapping in the next shift. At the same time, the cooperation of raw material workers and ingot workers, and the coordination of furnace and furnace tapping times are also very important. At the end of 1954, there were only 27 hours left before New Year's Day of 1955, but their December production task was still short of three heats of steel. If calculated according to 10 hours to smelt one heat of steel, there would still be a difference of three hours, but due to the unity of the workers in the three shifts and the close cooperation of the various sections, Class B created conditions for Class C, enabling Class C to create a new record of 7.55 minutes to produce a heat of steel. They finally successfully completed the task of producing three heats of steel in 27 hours.

Although the workers of No. 8 furnace have achieved the above results, they are not proud and complacent. They feel that the Party and the country have high demands on them, especially that they cannot yet produce steel according to steel grades. This year, the steelmaking plant stipulates that producing steel according to steel grades should account for 85 percent of the total number of steel ladles, but they only achieved 82 percent in the first quarter. They decided to consolidate their existing achievements, continue to vigorously carry out rapid steelmaking, protect the furnace body, reduce the time for cold and hot repairs, extend the life of the furnace roof and front wall, reduce the furnace breakdown rate, and ensure steel production according to planned steel grades, striving to complete the state plan ahead of schedule and produce more and better high-quality steel for the country.

    鞍钢八号炼钢炉全体职工的“五一”献礼
　　张世英
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂八号炼钢炉的职工，在今年头三个月里用快速炼钢的办法生产了四十炉钢，平均每炼一炉钢的时间比国家计划缩短了十六分钟，因而提前四天完成了今年第一季度的生产计划。四月份，他们争取提前三天完成全月的生产任务，保证较原计划多生产一千多吨钢，作为他们对今年“五一”节的献礼。
    八号炼钢炉被评为鞍钢一九五四年的模范炼钢炉。一九五四年，八号炼钢炉的职工们全面超额完成了国家生产计划，产量比一九五三年提高了百分之一点四五，质量比一九五三年提高了百分之一点零五，炼炉率达到百分之六点一，比计划降低了百分之二点三，降低成本七万五千八百元。一九五四年，八号炉的职工用快速炼钢的办法生产了九十四炉钢，创造了七点五十五分钟炼出一炉钢的新纪录，为国家多生产了八千五百吨钢。
    八号炉的职工们能取得上述这些成绩，主要是由于在党和苏联专家的帮助下，他们积极地、努力地提高了技术的结果。他们在实际工作中，深深地体验到快速炼钢是完成和超额完成生产任务的最好的办法。因为熔炼时间缩短、每月、每季和每年出的钢就会增多。按规定，他们出一炉钢的时间是十一点零五分，快速炼钢出一炉钢的时间是十点钟。如果每出一炉钢能减少一个多钟头，一个月就可以多出五炉多钢，一年就能多出六十多炉钢。
    快速炼钢是一种集体的、创造性的劳动，需要三个班工人的团结和各个工段之间的紧密配合，如果没有这个条件就不可能进行快速炼钢。八号炉三个班有二十多个工人，常常是上一班装料熔炼，下一班才出钢；上一班操作不好就要影响下一班出钢。同时，原料工人、铸锭工人的配合、炉和炉出钢时间的配合，也是很重要的。一九五四年年底，离一九五五年元旦只有二十七个钟头，但是他们十二月份的生产任务还差三炉钢。如果按照十个钟头炼一炉钢来计算，也还相差三个钟头，但是由于三个班工人的团结和各工段密切配合的结果，乙班为丙班创造了条件，使丙班创造了七点五十五分钟出一炉钢的新纪录，他们终于在二十七个钟头内胜利地完成了生产三炉钢的任务。
    八号炉的职工们虽然获得了上述这些成绩，他们并没有骄傲自满，他们感到党和国家对他们的要求很高，特别是他们还不能按钢种出钢。今年炼钢厂规定按钢种出钢应占出钢总罐数的百分之八十五，但是他们在第一季度只达到了百分之八十二。他们决定要巩固已有的成绩，继续努力开展快速炼钢，保护好炉体，减少冷热修的时间，延长炉顶和前墙的寿命，降低炼炉率，并且保证按计划钢种出钢，争取提前完成国家计划，为国家生产更多更好的优质钢。
