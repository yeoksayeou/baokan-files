Observer's Commentary

    Eight U.S. Air Force planes intruded into our Northeast airspace on the morning of May 10. Our air force immediately took off to intercept them, shooting down and damaging three invading U.S. planes. This is another military provocation by the United States against the Chinese people, and the U.S. government must bear full responsibility for the consequences arising therefrom.

    The U.S. Air Force Headquarters in Tokyo, in an attempt to shirk its guilt and confuse the public, issued a statement that turned black into white, claiming that U.S. Air Force planes were "attacked" by our air force "on the high seas west of the 38th parallel in Korea," and fabricated battle reports stating that the U.S. Air Force shot down two of our planes. Such deceptive tricks by the U.S. military authorities can only prove that the U.S. Air Force's invasion of our airspace on May 10 was a planned act of aggression.

    In order to support the war activities of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the U.S. government has continuously dispatched U.S. military aircraft to intrude into our airspace for demonstrations and provocations for several years. In the period of less than a year since the end of the Geneva Conference, U.S. military aircraft have intruded into our airspace a total of 316 batches and 883 sorties. The U.S. authorities either quibble or pretend to be deaf and dumb about these acts of aggression that we have accused them of. But the facts cannot be denied. The U.S. aircraft provocation incident that occurred this time adds new evidence to the U.S. aggressive acts.

    The Chinese people have repeatedly warned that China's territory and airspace are inviolable. The Chinese People's Liberation Army must resolutely counterattack provocateurs and aggressors in order to safeguard national sovereignty and security. However, the Chinese People's Liberation Army never threatens the security of others and never invades others outside of Chinese territory. The U.S. Air Force aircraft intruded into the airspace over places such as Dagushan, southwest of Andong City, Liaoning Province, on May 10. This area is thousands of miles away from the United States and hundreds of miles away from U.S.-occupied South Korea. What is the U.S. Air Force doing here? There can be no other explanation than deliberate provocation. However, this new U.S. provocation has failed once again.

    It is very clear that the recent U.S. provocations against our country are part of the U.S. aggressive clique's evil plan to threaten the Chinese people and attempt to prevent our liberation of Taiwan, and not, as U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson said, "an isolated and accidental event." The recent series of war activities carried out by the United States in Baguio, Bangkok, and Taiwan all show that the U.S. aggressive clique is doing everything possible to intensify the tense situation in the Far East and planning further armed intervention in our country. Our people must be doubly vigilant and resolutely smash any provocative conspiracy by the United States.

### 美国的挑衅必须受到惩罚

    美国的挑衅必须受到惩罚
    美国空军飞机八架五月十日上午侵入我国东北领空，我空军飞机当即起飞迎击，击落、击伤入侵的美国飞机三架。这是美国对中国人民的又一次军事挑衅，美国政府必须对于因此而引起的后果承担全部责任。
    东京美国空军总部为了推脱罪责，混淆视听，竟发表一项颠倒是非的声明，把事情说成是美国空军的飞机“在朝鲜三八线以西的公海上”受到我国空军的“袭击”，并捏造战报说，美国空军击落了我国飞机两架。美国军事当局的这种谎骗伎俩，显然只能证明美国空军五月十日侵犯我国领空是一桩有计划的侵犯行为。
    美国政府为了支持蒋介石卖国集团的战争活动，几年以来曾不断派遣美国的军用飞机侵犯我国领空，进行示威和挑衅。自从日内瓦会议结束以后不到一年的期间，侵犯我国领空的美国军用飞机共达三百一十六批、八百八十三架次。美国当局对于我方所指控的这些侵略罪行，不是强词狡辩就是装聋扮哑。但是事实是不容抵赖的。这一次发生的美国飞机挑衅事件，给美国的侵略行径增加了新的罪证。
    中国人民曾经一再警告，中国的领土和领空不容侵犯。中国人民解放军为了维护国家的主权和安全，对于挑衅者和侵略者必须予以坚决的回击。但中国人民解放军决不威胁别人的安全，从来不在中国领土以外侵犯别人。美国空军的飞机五月十日侵入我国辽宁省安东市西南大孤山等地上空，这一地区离美国数千英里，离美国占领的南朝鲜也有数百英里，美国空军到此何为？除了蓄意寻衅，是不可能有别的解释的。但是，美国的这个新的挑衅又一次失败了。
    事情很明白，美国最近继续对我国进行挑衅，是美国侵略集团向中国人民进行威胁、企图阻止我国解放台湾的罪恶计划的一部分，而不是如美国国防部长威尔逊所说的，“是一件孤立的偶然事件。”美国最近在碧瑶、曼谷和台湾进行的一连串战争活动，都表明了美国侵略集团千方百计要加剧远东的紧张局势，并策划进一步对我国进行武装干涉。我国人民一定要加倍警惕，坚决粉碎美国的任何挑衅阴谋。
