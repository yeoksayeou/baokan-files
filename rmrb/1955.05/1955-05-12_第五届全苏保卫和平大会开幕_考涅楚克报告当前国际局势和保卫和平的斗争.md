　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th Dispatch from TASS: The Fifth All-Soviet Peace Conference opened on the 10th in the Hall of Columns of the Trade Union Building in Moscow. Representatives from various Soviet republics, regions, and districts attended the conference.

　　Invited to participate in the conference were numerous foreign peace delegations, prominent peace activists, and a delegation from the France-USSR Association.

　　The meeting was presided over by Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee.

　　The conference adopted the following agenda:

　　1. Current international situation and the struggle of the peoples of all countries to defend peace.

　　2. Election of the Soviet delegation to attend the Helsinki World Peace Conference.

　　3. Election of the Soviet Peace Committee.

　　Korneichuk, a member of the Presidium of the Soviet Peace Committee, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Current International Situation and the Struggle of the Peoples of All Countries to Defend Peace."

　　In his report, Korneichuk discussed the current international situation and the tasks of peace defenders, as well as the Soviet people's struggle for peace. He said that we, the Soviet people, believe that there is no nobler happiness in the world than establishing a lasting world peace. Although the ratification of the Paris Agreements has complicated the international situation, the Soviet Union and the Soviet government will consistently seek ways to peacefully resolve various international issues. The Soviet government has always believed that all international disputes must be resolved through negotiation. The Soviet people and the Soviet government are united in their desire for peace, and they resolutely demand the prohibition of nuclear weapons. We believe that the unity of the powerful forces of peace will be able to once again repel the warmongers of atomic warfare. The forces of peace are inexhaustible, and truth is on the side of the forces of peace, which will lead to their victory.
