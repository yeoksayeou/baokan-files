Oil press workers in various parts of Sichuan Province are actively increasing oil yield, utilizing existing oilseeds to strive for an increase of 20 million catties of vegetable oil in 1955. The potential for oil yield in oil pressing factories throughout Sichuan is significant. In 1954, the average oil yield per 100 catties of oilseeds in the province was: rapeseed, over 35 catties; cottonseed, 11 catties; peanuts, over 27 catties; tung seeds, over 26 catties. The oil yield of various oilseeds did not reach the appropriate level. However, in areas where advanced oil pressing experience was promoted, oil yield significantly increased. In Xindu County, the average rapeseed oil yield reached 41 to 42 catties per 100 catties. In the Lanjiang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Suining County, the cottonseed oil yield increased to 17 catties per 100 catties. In the Jiqing District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhongjiang County, the peanut oil yield reached 34 catties. In many places, tung seed oil yield increased to around 30 catties. To promote advanced oil pressing experiences, in the first quarter of 1955, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry, Department of Commerce, and Supply and Marketing Cooperative successively convened experience exchange meetings on tung oil and edible oilseed processing. The province also established an office for promoting advanced oil pressing methods, and supply and marketing cooperatives, handicraft management departments, and oil companies in various counties and cities jointly organized oilseed processing management offices to be responsible for processing management and promoting advanced experience. According to calculations, if the oil yield of edible vegetable oil is increased by 1.5 catties per 100 catties of oilseeds based on the 1954 oil yield, the province can increase oil production by 12 million catties; if the oil yield of industrial oil is increased by 2.2 catties per 100 catties of oilseeds, the province can increase production by 8 million catties.

　　四川各地榨油工人积极争取提高产油率
    四川省各地榨油工人积极提高产油率，利用现有油料，争取一九五五年增产两千万斤植物油。四川各地榨油工厂的产油率潜力很大。一九五四年全省每百斤油料平均产油率是：菜籽三十五斤多，棉籽十一斤，花生果二十七斤多，桐籽二十六斤多。各种油料产油都没有达到应有水平。但是推广先进榨油经验的地方，产油率都有显著提高。新都县菜籽榨油每百斤产油率平均达到四十一、四十二斤。遂宁县栏江区供销合作社油坊每百斤棉籽产油率提高到十七斤。中江县辑庆区供销合作社花生果产油达到三十四斤。许多地方桐籽产油提高到三十斤左右。为推广先进榨油经验，一九五五年第一季度四川省工业厅、商业厅和供销合作社先后召开了桐油和食用油料加工经验交流会，全省并成立了推广先进榨油法办公室，各县市的供销合作社、手工业管理部门和油脂公司也共同组织了油料加工管理办公室，负责加工管理和推广先进经验。据计算，食用植物油如在一九五四年产油率基础上每百斤油料提高一斤五两，全省就可以增产食油一千二百万斤；工业用油的产油率如每百斤油料提高二斤二两，全省可以增产八百万斤。
