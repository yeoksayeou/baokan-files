　　Hu Feng Must Not Be Allowed to Muddle Through
　　Wu Xiaoru
Seeing the "Some Materials Regarding the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" exposed by Shu Wu, I was truly shocked and horrified. These materials aroused boundless indignation in me, and my mood was disturbed for a long time. Now we have finally seen through this two-faced fellow hiding within our united cultural front, secretly engaging in anti-Party activities. This is a great victory on the cultural front. From this, I have a clearer understanding that the Party's timely launching of a resolute struggle against Hu Feng's anti-Marxist, bourgeois idealist literary thought in recent months was completely correct and absolutely necessary. Without the keen and insightful theoretical weapon of Marxism-Leninism, we could not have seen through the true anti-Party, anti-people face of Hu Feng and his clique so quickly, and we would not have today's victory!
Hu Feng has always touted himself as a revolutionary hero, posing as a disciple of Lu Xun. This "smokescreen" of his, wearing the mask of a progressive writer and donning the cloak of Marxism, has confused the vision of many. Today, seeing the materials exposed by Shu Wu, we recognize that Hu Feng consistently opposed and resisted the Party's ideological and organizational leadership of the literary and art circles from the time of the Anti-Japanese War. He wantonly slandered and insulted comrades who implemented the Party's literary and art policies, and regarded progressive writers outside the Party as philistines and opportunists. May I ask Hu Feng, is this how intellectuals who found a "foothold" under the leadership of the Party should treat comrades and friends? Is this hostile and hateful attitude towards the Party the behavior expected of a successor to Lu Xun? In fact, Hu Feng has not only been hostile to the Party and the people for a long time, but he also used Lu Xun as a smokescreen to achieve his own fraudulent purposes. Would someone loyal to Lu Xun say "as usual, it's a disaster for me" and "commemorating the dead with those gentlemen is extremely boring" when the ninth anniversary of Lu Xun's death was to be commemorated?
I deeply feel that the Party's attitude towards Hu Feng has always been benevolent and righteous. In 1948, in Shanghai under reactionary rule, the Party, concerned about Hu Feng's safety, once advised him to go to the liberated areas; after the national liberation, the help given to Hu Feng by comrades Lin Mohan and He Qifang was also serious and sincere. But how did Hu Feng treat the Party? He regarded the advice to escape danger as trying to "force" him and wanting to "invite" him away immediately; he regarded comrades who advised him and criticized his erroneous ideas as "masters" and "judges"; and recently, as the Party and the people launched a resolute struggle against his reactionary literary and artistic thoughts, he retreated in order to advance, using grandstanding "self-criticism" to deceive the Party and the people, attempting to put a dubious label of "petty bourgeoisie" on himself and then make a clean getaway! You should know that the masses have discerning eyes, the Party's leadership always proceeds from the interests of the masses, and Marxism-Leninism is invincible. Hu Feng's tricks of feigned self-criticism can only be used to deceive himself!
As an intellectual of petty-bourgeois origin who is willing to follow the Party, I have every right to warn Hu Feng: the Party and the people will absolutely not allow you to wear a mask and muddle through with a disguise!

　　不能让胡风鬼混过去
　　吴小如
    看到舒芜所揭发的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”，我真是感到怵目惊心。这些材料引起我无比的愤慨，使我的心情好久不能平静。现在我们终于看清了这个混在我们文化统一战线中暗中进行反党活动的口是心非的家伙，这是文化战线上的一个大胜利。从这里我更加清楚地认识到，最近几个月来，党对胡风的反马克思主义的资产阶级唯心主义的文艺思想，及时地展开了坚决的斗争，是完全正确、完全必要的。没有洞若观火、烛隐抉微的马克思列宁主义的理论武器，我们就不能一下子看穿胡风及其集团的反党、反人民的真面目，我们就没有今天的胜利！
    胡风素以革命功臣的身份自吹自擂，俨然以鲁迅的信徒自居，他这种戴了进步作家的假面具、披了马克思主义外衣的“障眼法”，曾混淆了许多人的视线。今天看到舒芜所揭发的材料，我们认清了胡风从抗日战争时期，就一贯反对、抵制党对文艺界的思想领导和组织领导。他对执行党的文艺政策的同志肆意加以诋毁和辱骂，把党外的进步作家看成了市侩和投机分子。请问胡风，在党的领导下才找到“安身立命之地”的知识分子，就是这样的对待同志和朋友么？这种对党敌对、仇视的态度，就是鲁迅的继承者应有的表现么？事实上，胡风不但同党和人民久已敌对，就是对于鲁迅，也不过是打着幌子以达到他招摇撞骗的目的而已。一个忠实于鲁迅的人会在要纪念鲁迅逝世九周年的时候说出“照例对我是灾难”和“与那些诸公合伙纪念死人，无聊之至”的话来吗？
    我深切地体会到，党对待胡风的态度始终是仁至义尽的。在一九四八年，在反动统治下的上海，党担心胡风的安全，曾经劝他到解放区去；全国解放以后，林默涵和何其芳两位同志对胡风的帮助，也是严肃而诚恳的。可是胡风对党是怎样的呢？他把劝他脱离险境看成是尽力“逼”他，想把他“马上‘请’走”；把规劝过他，批评过他的错误思想的同志们看成是“老爷们”“法官”；而在最近，由于党和人民对他的反动文艺思想展开了坚决的斗争，他就以退为进，用夸夸其谈的“自我批判”来欺骗党和人民，企图给自己扣上一顶似是而非的“小资产阶级”的帽子，然后溜之大吉！要知道，群众的眼睛是雪亮的，党的领导永远是从群众的利益出发的，马克思列宁主义是攻无不克、战无不胜的，胡风这种假检讨的鬼蜮伎俩，只好用来欺骗自己！
    作为一个小资产阶级出身、愿意跟着党走的知识分子，我完全有权利向胡风提出警告：党和人民绝对不能让你戴着面具、披着伪装鬼混过去！
