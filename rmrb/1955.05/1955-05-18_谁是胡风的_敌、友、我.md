Who are Hu Feng's "Enemies, Friends, and Us"?
Cao Yu

After reading Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" and Mr. Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" published afterwards, I feel that there is nothing more to talk about regarding Hu Feng, because the facts are so clear, the contrast between the "surface" and the "reality" is so obvious that it can be said that it does not need any annotation and has already vividly depicted Hu Feng's face. But I can't suppress my anger, I want to denounce this hypocrite, I want to speak.

As everyone knows, the evaluation of a person depends on what he actually sells, not on his flowery words.

If I had not read the secret letters of Hu Feng revealed by Shu Wu, Hu Feng's "self-criticism" would have appeared so sincere, honest and upright! At one moment he says that he advocates having a "standpoint of sharing destiny with the people," at another moment he says that he must have "an attitude of love and hate towards enemies, friends, and ourselves," at another moment he insists on having "the spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism," and at another moment he emphasizes his consistently promoted "benevolent mind" and "sincere ideological demands." Hu Feng, who switched from offense to retreat, was covered in the dazzling "petty-bourgeois revolutionary nature and standpoint." His mistake was said to be merely confusing the distinction between the petty-bourgeois revolutionary nature and standpoint and the working-class revolutionary nature and standpoint. And look, how grateful he is to the leadership of the Party! How deeply he regrets his mistakes! Saying things like "If it weren't for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I personally would not have found a place to live in the past twenty years," saying things like "some sacrificed martyrs and comrades who have been fighting loyally have guided me, taught me, and some comrades have long persuaded me and expected me," saying things like "my personal small work comes from the great revolutionary cause," saying things like "I deeply feel that I have failed the people, failed the Party and the cause of the class, and failed the great era." In his self-criticism, everything shows that he is a noble and upright fighter who has been pursuing the truth. Although he has some errors in his understanding, this is nothing more than the inevitable frustration of a revolutionary from a petty-bourgeois origin. From the motivation and original intention, he has always been loyal and sincere to the Party and the people.

However, the facts were revealed, and the mask was torn off. In the "dark" corner of Hu Feng's heart, what position does the Chinese Communist Party hold? It turns out that the Party he mentions with gratitude is the "officialdom," and he "cannot compromise" with it, but "perfunctoriness must always be perfunctory." The responsible comrades in the Party's literary and art work who had "taught" him, "guided" him, "persuaded" him for a long time, and "expected" him, are in his secret letters, originally "masters," "the powerful," "officials," "mandarin jackets," and "young masters." In 1948 (when the people's war of liberation against the American and Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries was developing towards its climax), when the Party's writers criticized his literary and art ideas, he believed that it was "launching various despicable means" against him, "resisting and counterattacking" him, and was a "particularly bad" "opponent," warning his followers "not to underestimate the enemy" because "we" (that is, the Hu Feng clique) were going to "shake the twenty-year rule of mechanism."

Hu Feng's writing has always been obscure and difficult to understand, with many things seemingly wanting to be said but unwilling to be said, making readers guess in the direction of Marxism-Leninism. I always thought that his articles were inevitably ungrammatical from the start. Now I understand that only when he is unable to write to his heart's content about his hatred and resentment towards the Party, does his tongue seem to be tied with a rope, bumpy and unable to say any smooth words of truth. But once he feels that he has found someone he trusts, someone he can speak freely to, his articles are like wild horses released from their cages, unrestrained and fluent, pouring out his full of hatred uncontrollably. Not only are the Party and the Party's literary and art workers objects of his ridicule and hostility, even progressive literary and art workers who lean towards the Party and are close to the Party cannot escape his vicious sarcasm. They are "local tyrants," "philistines," and "maggots." And these comrades, during the Kuomintang rule, together with the Party's literary and art workers, were brutally persecuted by the Kuomintang secret agents, lived and died together, and have been struggling for the people's revolutionary cause in a poor and hostile environment. But how does Hu Feng treat them? He advised Shu Wu to "be wary of them, affirm them, wrap insults in smiles and shake hands with them, but if you have a trace of hope for them, you are insulting yourself." There is not a trace of comradeship here, no feeling of fighting for a common cause! He "affirms" us, originally to "be wary" of us, he "shakes hands" with us, originally his "smile" hides vicious "insults," and he warns his followers that if they "have a trace of hope for us, they are insulting themselves." Can a person, if he can still be considered a real person, treat friends and comrades like this?

But in fact, there is something even more terrible. When comrades criticized the articles of his small group, look at what attitude he took. He advised Mr. Shu Wu: "The response to the masters is too cockfighting. Not grand enough. There is a whip wrapped in rubber with steel wire to beat prisoners, injuring them but not showing the scars on the surface, I think it is a good method." Hu Feng, you certainly know that only Kuomintang secret agents treat revolutionaries with such vicious means, and only fascist reactionary rulers can think of such methods!

However, Hu Feng has always professed to be "sincere" and "benevolent," and capable of "loving and hating."

I remember at the Second Congress of Chinese Literary Workers, Hu Feng talked very sentimentally about the issue of fighting friendship in the historical literary world. He talked about how the great critic Belinsky loved Gogol; how the talented and broad-minded Nemirovich-Danchenko sincerely loved Stanislavsky. The implication was that only he—Hu Feng—understood such great feelings, and as he spoke慷慨陳詞, his eyes were actually full of tears. Today, I shudder to think of his "whip wrapped in rubber with steel wire." I find it hard to believe that the person who fervently worshiped Belinsky and praised the great fighting friendship is precisely the person who raises the rubber whip, wanting to "injure" friends and also make sure that "scars are not visible"!

In those gloomy and murderous secret letters, Hu Feng's "enemies" and Hu Feng's "us" are already very clear. But who are his "friends"? Could it still be the Party he hates? Could it still be the people he hates?

It is said that there is a nine-tailed fox, and because it has nine tails, it is the most cunning of foxes. Today, this nine-tailed fox seems to have only revealed one tail. But it is better to reveal it than not to reveal it, and it is better to reveal all of them than to reveal only one. Because when the fox's tail is completely revealed, everyone will know that this is a real "fox spirit" and must be "beaten." Furthermore, when the fox knows that it is a fox in front of the masses, it will begin to plan and want to transform into a human.

Naturally, who are Hu Feng's substantive "friends"? Anyone can say this for him. Therefore, the only way out for Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique is to honestly reveal all the truth.

　　谁是胡风的“敌、友、我”
　　曹禺
    读了胡风的“我的自我批判”和刊载在后面的舒芜先生的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”之后，我觉得对胡风，已经没有什么话可谈了，因为事实摆得这样清楚，“表”和“里”对照得这样明白，可以说用不着任何注解，已经活脱脱地画出胡风的面貌。但是我又按捺不住自己的愤怒，我要斥责这个伪善者，我要说话。
    谁都知道，对一个人的评价，是要看他实际卖的是什么货色，而不看他嘴上是怎么样地花言巧语。
    如果没有读舒芜揭露的胡风的密信的话，胡风的“自我批判”显得是多么诚恳老实，光明磊落！一会儿说他主张要有“和人民共命运的立场”，一会儿又是要有“对于敌、友、我的爱爱仇仇的态度”，一会儿又坚持要有“革命的人道主义精神”，一会儿又强调他一直宣传着的“仁爱的胸怀”“真诚的思想要求”。从进攻转变为退却的胡风混身披挂着金光耀眼的“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”。他的错误据说仅仅是混淆了小资产阶级的革命性和立场同工人阶级的革命性和立场的区别。而且你看，对党的领导，他是多么感激涕零！对他所犯的错误，又感到多么沉痛悔恨！什么“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的”，什么“一些牺牲了的先烈们和一直忠贞战斗着的同志们引导过我，教导过我，有些同志长期以来规劝过我，期待着我”，什么“我个人的一点微小的工作是从伟大的革命事业而来”，什么“我沉痛地感到辜负了人民，辜负了党和阶级事业，辜负了伟大的时代”。在他的自我批判里，一切都说明了他是一个一直在追求着真理的高尚而正直的斗士。尽管他在认识上有些错误，然而这不过是出身在小资产阶级的革命家难以避免的挫折，从动机和本意来讲，他对党和人民一直是忠实而真诚的。
    然而事实被揭露了，假面具被揭穿了。在胡风
  “阴暗”的心的角落里，中国共产党是站在什么一个地位呢？原来他提起来就感激涕零的党是“官方”，对它“妥协不来”的，但“敷衍总是要敷衍的”。“教导”过他，“引导”过他，“长期以来规劝”过他、
  “期待”过他的党的文艺工作中负责同志，在他的密信里，原来是“老爷”，“权贵”，“官们”，“马褂”，“公子们”。在一九四八年（正是人民反美蒋反动派的解放战争向高潮发展的时候），当党的作家批评了他的文艺思想，他认为那是对他“发动各种卑鄙的手段”，向他“抵抗、反攻”，是“特别恶劣”的“对手”，警告他的追随者“不能轻敌”，因为“我们”（即胡风小集团）是要“动摇二十年的机械论的统治势力”的。
    胡风写文章一向是晦涩难懂的，里面仿佛有许多话要谈又不愿意谈出来，使得读者可以向马克思列宁主义方面猜想。我一直以为他的文章落笔就必然是不通顺的。现在我才明白，只有当他不能够称心如意地写出他对党的仇视和痛恨的时候，他的舌头就仿佛拴上了一根绳子，疙疙瘩瘩，说不出什么通顺的真心话来。但一旦他觉得找到了他所信任的，可以畅所欲言的对象的时候，他的文章就如野马脱笼，奔放而流畅，不可抑止地倾出他那满腔的仇恨。不只是党和党的文艺工作者是他所嘲笑和敌视的对象，连倾向党、靠近党的进步文艺工作者也免不了遭受他的恶毒的讽刺。那是“豪绅”，是“市侩”，是
  “蛆虫”。而这些同志们，在国民党统治时期，和党的文艺工作者一同受到国民党特务残酷的迫害，出生入死，一直在贫穷、敌对的环境中，为着人民的革命事业奋斗的。但是胡风怎么样对待他们呢？他劝舒芜说：要“警戒他们，肯定他们，用微笑包着侮蔑和他们握手言欢都可以，但如果对他们发生了一丝的希望，那就是自己污辱了自己”。这里何曾有一点点同志间的感情，为共同事业奋斗的感情！他“肯定”我们，原来为的是“警戒”我们，他跟我们“握手言欢”，原来他“微笑”里藏着恶毒的“侮蔑”，而且他警告了他的追随者们，如果对我们“发生了一丝的希望，那就是自己污辱了自己”。难道一个人，若果他还可以算一个真正的人的话，可以这样对待朋友和同志么？
    但事实上还有厉害的，当着同志们批评了他的小集团的文章的时候，你看他采取的是什么样的态度。他劝舒芜先生说：“对于大师们的回敬，太斗鸡式的了。气派不大。有一种用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕，我以为是好方法。”胡风，你当然知道，只有国民党特务对待革命者才会用这样的毒手，只有法西斯反动统治者才会想出这样的办法！
    然而，胡风一向以“真诚”“仁爱”自命，并且是能够“爱爱仇仇”的。
    我想起在中国文学工作者第二次代表大会上，胡风曾十分多情地谈起历史的文坛上战斗的友情的问题。他说起伟大的批评家别林斯基如何爱护果戈
  理；多才多艺的、胸襟阔大的聂米罗维奇—丹钦科如何赤诚地爱护斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基。言下之意，只有他——胡风，明白这样伟大的感情，而慷慨陈词的他，说着说着，居然满眶泪水了。今天我不寒而栗地想到他那根“橡皮包着钢丝”的“鞭子”，我很难相信那个热烈地崇拜着别林斯基、歌颂伟大的战斗友谊的人，恰恰就是那个举起橡皮鞭子，要“打伤了”朋友，还要“看不出伤痕”的人！
    在那阴气森森，而又杀气腾腾的密信中，胡风的“敌”和胡风的“我”已经很清楚了。但谁又是他的“友”呢？难道还可能是他所仇视的党么？难道还可能是他所仇视的人民么？
    据说有一种九尾狐，因为有九条尾巴的缘故，才是狐狸中最狡猾的。今天这个九条尾巴的狐狸，似乎才露出一条。但，露出来总比不露出来好，而都露出来又比仅仅露出一条好。因为尾巴完全露出来的狐狸，大家才知道这是个真“狐狸精”，必须“打”。再则，狐狸知道自己在群众面前是个狐狸，才开始打算，想转变为人。
    自然，胡风实质上的“友人”可能是谁呢？这是任何人都可以替他说出来的。因此，胡风及其反党小集团只有老老实实地把全部真相揭露出来，才是他们每一个人唯一的出路。
