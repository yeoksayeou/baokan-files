The temporary engineering standards of the Jilin Thermal Power Plant are too high.

Chen Shengze

Due to the construction unit and relevant leading bodies' lack of attention to saving state funds and their mechanical application of Soviet design standards without considering China's current socio-economic conditions, the temporary engineering work at the Jilin Thermal Power Plant is excessively costly, resulting in serious waste.

For example, the cement concrete mixing plant, with an area of only 245 square meters, used as much as 267 cubic meters of timber, of which 75% was mature red and white pine timber and logs. This timber alone cost 23,310 yuan. Including other materials, labor, and unnecessary decorations, the cost per square meter reached over 247 yuan, exceeding the temporary engineering cost index issued by the General Bureau of Power Industry this year by a factor of ten. The cement concrete prefabrication yard, built entirely of timber, cost more than 122 yuan per square meter, exceeding the index stipulated by the General Bureau of Power Industry by six times. Two temporary garages cost 61 yuan per square meter for one and 52 yuan for the other. The cement warehouse used compacted earth and wooden floors, costing about 73 yuan per square meter. An ordinary material warehouse also used a brick and wood structure, with a unit cost of more than 41 yuan.

The temporary offices and dormitories are even more extravagant. The offices and toilets on the construction site all adopted Soviet-style roof trusses and brick-wood structures, costing more than 42 yuan per square meter. The general office used both wooden and cement floors, and some departments were equipped with cold-proof and fire-proof sheds. The interior walls were whitewashed, the doors and windows were repeatedly painted, the ceilings had chandeliers, and all were equipped with formal heating equipment, costing as much as 72.3 yuan per square meter.

The temporary dormitories and other temporary welfare buildings are also very lavish. The 24 temporary single dormitories and 62 temporary family dormitories all had tiled roofs, clean water red brick walls with white ash pointing, paper-pasted or plastered ceilings, double-layered, three-pane glass windows, and every household had a kang (heated brick bed). Four single workers lived in a small room. The clinic had pebble foundations and cement floors, the roof was equipped with a cold-proof shed, and for the sake of beautiful interior walls, it was painted with the high-grade whitewashing material "Cosaine," and was also equipped with gooseneck lamps. The nurseries, in addition to single-layer doors and double-layer windows, also had ceiling lights and spherical lights, and all plumbing equipment was repeatedly painted, costing more than 98 yuan per square meter. Bathhouses and barber shops cost as much as 156 yuan per square meter, and even the 19 temporary toilets cost more than 70 yuan per square meter.

According to the various indicators stipulated in the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Temporary Buildings" issued by the General Bureau of Power Industry in 1955, the maximum cost of temporary dormitories in the Northeast region should not exceed 35 yuan per square meter. Warehouses for dangerous goods and dangerous processing or repair factories should be reduced to between 35 yuan and 25 yuan. Offices, canteens, and other welfare buildings should not exceed 20 yuan per square meter. However, the cost of the temporary engineering work at the Jilin Thermal Power Plant has exceeded the indicators by five to twelve times in some cases, and at least more than one time in the lowest cases.

This is an intolerable waste. What difference is there between such temporary engineering and permanent engineering? Some people think: "For construction tasks with long construction periods, temporary engineering must be done better." This statement is wrong. Because although some projects have long construction periods, the period during which the largest amount of work and the highest utilization rate of temporary engineering is not long. After this period, various completed permanent buildings can be used, and some temporary engineering is only needed in the early stage and not in the later stage. For example, the barbed wire fence built by the Jilin Thermal Power Plant at a cost of 27,266 yuan immediately lost its function after the formal fence was built. If bamboo fences were used instead, it would only cost more than 6,000 yuan.

Every year and every month, many projects start construction in our country, and every construction site has temporary engineering. If these temporary projects with very short service lives and that will be demolished after the formal project is completed are too expensive, a large amount of funds will be wasted.

### 吉林热电站的临时工程标准太高了

　　吉林热电站的临时工程标准太高了
　　陈圣泽
    吉林热电站的临时工程，由于施工单位和有关领导机关不重视节约国家资金，不根据我国目前社会经济条件，机械地套用苏联设计标准，因此造价过高，造成了严重的浪费。
    例如，面积不过二百四十五平方公尺的水泥混凝土搅拌厂，光木材就用了二百六十七立方公尺，其中红白松成材和圆木占百分之七十五。这些木材一共花了二万三千三百一十元。加上其他材料、人工和一些不必要的装饰，每平方公尺的造价达二百四十七元多。同今年电业管理总局所颁布的临时工程造价指标相比，超过了十倍。全部用木材搭起来的水泥混凝土预制场，每平方公尺的造价也在一百二十二元以上，超过了电业管理总局规定的指标六倍。两个临时汽车库，一个每平方公尺造价为六十一元，另一个为五十二元。水泥仓库采用的是三合土地面和地板，每平方公尺造价约七十三元。一个普通的材料仓库，也使用砖木结构，单位造价达四十一元多。
    临时办公室和临时宿舍气派更大。工地上的办公室和厕所，都采用了苏联式屋架和砖木结构，每平方公尺造价为四十二元多。总办公室室内则是地板和水泥地面并用，部分科室还设有防寒棚和防火棚，内墙粉刷白灰，门窗反复油漆，天棚有吊灯，全部安装的是正式取暖设备，每平方公尺造价高达七十二元三角。
    临时宿舍和其他临时福利建筑物也是非常阔气。二十四栋临时单身宿舍和六十二栋临时家属宿舍全都是粘瓦屋面，一面清水红色砖墙，白灰拘缝，内壁是纸糊天棚，抹灰天棚，双层三扇玻璃窗，而且家家都有火坑。单身职工四人住一个小房间。医务所内全部是卵石地基、水泥地面，屋顶设有防寒棚，为了内壁美观，涂的是高级粉刷材料“可赛银”，另外还装有歪脖灯。托儿所内除了单层门、双层窗，还有天棚灯、球形灯，全部水暖设备是反复油漆过的，每平方公尺的造价是九十八元多。浴池和理发室每平方公尺的造价高达一百五十六元，甚至连十九幢临时厕所每平方公尺的造价都要七十多元。
    根据电业管理总局颁布的一九五五年临时建筑暂行管理办法中规定的各项指标，东北地区临时宿舍每平方公尺最高造价不得超过三十五元。危险品仓库和危险性加工厂或修配厂要降至三十五元到二十五元之间。办公室、食堂和其他福利建筑每平方公尺不得超过二十元。而吉林热电站临时工程的造价有的已超过指标五倍到十二倍，最低也超过一倍以上。
    这是一种不能容忍的浪费。像这样的临时工程，同永久工程又有什么区别呢？有人认为：“工期长的建设任务，临时工程就得搞好一些。”这种说法是错误的。因为有些工程虽然工期较长，但工程量最大、临时工程利用率最高的时期是不长的，过了这一时期，各种已建成的永久性建筑就可以利用，而且有些临时工程只有前期需要，后期并不需要。如吉林热电站花了二万七千二百六十六元建筑起来的刺丝围墙，在正式围墙建成后马上就失去了作用，如果改用竹笆代替，只需要六千多元就够了。
    我国每年每月都有许多工程开工，每个工地都有临时工程，如果这些使用年限很短，正式工程建成后就要拆除的临时工程造价过于昂贵，就会浪费掉大量的资金。
