　  In the past two months, the State Bank of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has provided loans totaling 154 million Vietnamese dong to residents of North Vietnam to help them overcome the difficulties caused by natural disasters and enemy destruction, and to restore and increase production.

    The State Bank used these loans to provide nearly 24,000 households with sufficient funds and grain to plant nearly 10,000 Vietnamese acres (one Vietnamese acre is approximately equal to five Chinese mu) of summer rice and subsidiary crops, and to cultivate more than 5,000 Vietnamese acres of long-term fallow land. These loans also helped farmers in the north to build a medium-sized water conservancy project, guaranteeing irrigation for 4,500 Vietnamese acres of rice paddies, and enabling farmers to purchase more than 120,000 kilograms of fertilizer.

　  越南政府贷款帮助人民恢复生产
    越南民主共和国国家银行在过去两个月中已给予北越居民总数达一亿五千四百万越币的贷款，来帮助他们克服由于天灾和敌人的破坏所造成的困难，恢复和提高生产。
    国家银行用这些贷款使将近二万四千户有了足够的款项和粮食，来种植近一万越亩（一越亩约等于五华亩）夏稻和副作物，以及开垦五千越亩以上的长期休耕地。这些贷款还帮助了北部的农民修建一座中型水利工程，保证了四千五百越亩稻田的灌溉，并使农民能够购买十二万公斤以上的肥料。
