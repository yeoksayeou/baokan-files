　　The National Characteristics of Chinese Puppet Shows and Shadow Plays
　　Zhu Dan
　　Puppet shows (also known as marionette shows) and shadow plays are twin sisters in Chinese folk art, with relatively close connections in terms of origin and artistic form. They have a fairly long history in the history of Chinese opera, with many preserved genres and a wide distribution area. They are also among the most traditional and distinctive arts in China.

　　As early as the Tang and Song Dynasties, there were so-called "shadow plays," and Song Dynasty notes recorded many; at that time, the production methods and performance techniques were almost the same as today's shadow plays. The origin of puppet shows is even earlier, and this relatively primitive form of drama had already appeared in the Han Dynasty, two thousand years ago. According to historical records, most of the puppet shows and shadow plays across the country began in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties; some are even earlier, such as the puppet shows in Shanghang, Fujian, which began to become popular in the early Ming Dynasty.

　　However, in the old society, these two folk arts were never valued. After the liberation of the whole country, under the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," the artists of various genres were emancipated, and puppet shows and shadow plays also gained some rectification and development under the support and leadership of the Party and government in various places. In the past five years, puppet shows and shadow plays have formed a considerable force throughout the country; according to the existing incomplete statistics from twenty-two provinces and cities, there are 2,054 puppet and shadow play troupes with 11,147 artists.

　　In order to review the combat strength of this force, exchange work experience, and further study the future direction of improvement and development, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China held the first National Puppet Show and Shadow Play Performance and Observation Meeting in Beijing in April of this year. Representatives from twelve key provinces attended the meeting and performed many traditional and new plays. Due to the inherent advantages of these two art forms and the foundation they have established among the masses for a long time, they have not only become arts familiar and loved by the broad masses of people, especially farmers, but also arts that can be mastered by the masses themselves; currently, most of the puppet show and shadow play troupes across the country are amateur and semi-professional art groups organized by the farmers themselves.

　　The Puppet Show and Shadow Play Performance and Observation Meeting performed a total of fifty-three plays, most of which were the original traditional plays from various places. In terms of content, first, they used historical stories and myths and legends as themes, such as "Jiang Gan Stealing the Book," "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats," and "Broken Bridge," "Flaming Mountain," "Nezha Stirring up the Sea," etc.; some used fairy tales and fables as themes, such as "Mr. Dong Guo and the Wolf" and "The Crane and the Turtle"; and there were also programs specializing in performing puppet and shadow play stunts, such as "Hua Zhenfang's Street Performance." Secondly, some were programs with new content written based on modern life, such as the shadow play "Workers and Peasants Celebrate Together" from Heilongjiang and the Guangdong string puppet "Fan Shoushan" reflecting the land reform policy. Among the new programs specifically for children, there was the Hunan improved shadow play "Two Friends," "Greedy Monkey Brother," adapted from animal stories. Although these newly written programs reflecting modern life were not many in this performance, and there were still some shortcomings in the themes and expression methods, this new attempt and the spirit of daring to improve are worthy of attention and encouragement.

　　Due to the progress of the entire society and the improvement of the people's awareness, puppet shows and shadow plays must carry out some necessary reforms in the content of traditional plays and actively create new plays that can reflect the modern life of the people in order to adapt to the urgent needs of the objective situation. Under such requirements, in the few years since liberation, some traditional plays with feudal superstitions and obscene toxins have been banned and revised by the cultural authorities in various places in conjunction with the artists; such toxic plays as "The Realm of Yin and Yang," "The Soul-Returning Silk," "Capturing the Third Son Alive," and "Petty Jealousy" are no longer appearing on the stage of puppet shows and shadow plays.

　　In the work of creating new plays, although it has not been carried out in a planned way nationwide in recent years, puppet and shadow play troupes in various places have automatically staged a batch of new programs in the past, especially the shadow play artists who performed "The White-Haired Girl" and "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" as early as 1949. Coordinating with the large-scale political movements since the founding of the country, they performed plays such as "Yiguan's Harmful Ways," "The Two Elders' Donation," "Everyone Is Satisfied," "People Strive to Go Higher," and many programs performed at this meeting, to promote the path of socialist transformation during the transition period to farmers and to raise and encourage their enthusiasm for production.

　　Since China's puppet shows and shadow plays come from the folk and are closely related to the lives and production struggles of the masses, they have a very strong sense of life and local color, both in content and form. In form, China's puppet shows and shadow plays are closely combined with local operas in various places, which is a major feature of China's puppet shows and shadow plays. Therefore, it has rich stage movements, especially dance movements, and beautiful musical language, which is consistent with the tradition of Chinese national opera. Therefore, many traditional plays are expressed in the form of song and dance drama, such as "Little Cowherd" and "Stealing Immortal Herbs." The themes are simple and vivid, the language and movements are rich and lively, and full of rhythmic beauty. Many scenes are sung and danced, and the audience even feels that the characters in these plays are most suitable for being performed by puppets. This proves that China's puppet shows and shadow plays will be able to cooperate with the development of new song and dance dramas to create programs with their own unique style. In terms of portraying characters, China's puppet shows and shadow plays have achieved great success. In the past, some countries believed that puppet shows could only perform comedies and not tragedies; the roles of puppet shows were only suitable for expressing satirical themes with exaggerated forms and humorous movements, but in the lyrical plays such as "Huating Meeting," "The Second Hall Abandons His Son," "Xi Peng Strikes the Palm," "Cosmic Frontier," and "Broken Bridge" performed this time, they were all able to convey the inner feelings of the characters with delicate movements and create realistic character personalities, making the puppet roles and shadow figures become living people with flesh and blood on the stage.

　　Secondly, China's puppet shows and shadow plays are also good at performing comedies, good at performing humorous and satirical themes, and very bold in using exaggeration. For example, in the play "Flaming Mountain," the scene of Sun Wukong drilling into the belly of the Bull Demon King is shown; in "Happy Forest," it describes Wu Song putting Jiang Menshen's woman into a vat, and later the shop assistant broke the vat, and then rescued the woman from the gap. In addition, in the plays "Water Flooding Jinshan" and "Receiving Three Disciples," the plots of gods and demons are used to bring many unique images and movements to the stage, increasing the romantic atmosphere and comedic effect of the play. In addition, because the stage of puppet shows has fewer restrictions, it can use many performance methods that are difficult to achieve on general drama stages; such as the wolf in "Mr. Dong Guo and the Wolf" can speak, and Zhao Jianzi can ride a horse across the stage, which not only does not detract from the overall stage beauty, but also increases the authenticity of the play.

　　Finally, some tense and fierce martial arts scenes and the unique techniques of puppets and shadows often appear on the stage of Chinese puppet shows and shadow plays; such as the martial arts in "Centipede Ridge" and "Happy Forest," the soaring clouds and driving mists in "Havoc in Heaven," and the water fight in "Water Flooding Jinshan" are all performed very wonderfully. The juggling gourds, playing snakes, and lion dances in "Daming Prefecture"; the dragon battle in "Havoc in the Dragon Palace," as well as the underwater battle in "Water Capturing Pang De," and the fireworks in "Burning Puyang" are not possible on ordinary stages. In some plays, puppets and shadow figures can dress, tie belts, untie buttons, somersault, and spin, overcoming the innate defects that puppets and shadow figures are not easy to move flexibly. These all demonstrate the high skills and outstanding ingenuity of Chinese puppet and shadow artists.

　　In terms of production and modeling, Chinese puppets and shadows have always focused on simplicity, flexibility, and decorative interest. For example, the eyes of Guangdong puppets can not only open and close up and down, but also look left and right to help express inner emotions; the limbs and hands of Hunan and Sichuan puppets are very flexible and can receive objects; the shadows of Heilongjiang can walk and speak. These are the results of the hard work of artists over the years. In terms of modeling, Chinese puppets and shadow figures have their own characteristics. The puppet heads carved by Jiang Jiazou, an old artist from Fujian, each have a prominent personality and his own original artistic style. The shadows in Qinghai and other places also show a special pattern beauty.

　　Now, the production technology of puppets and shadows has been greatly improved in various places. For example, the improved shadows in Hunan have added a push stage, eliminated shadow sticks on the screen, and added a pull-line device to the operation of the shadows. These technical improvements make our art production more scientific, which should be advocated.

　　The music and singing of puppet shows and shadow plays are also extraordinarily rich. From this performance and observation meeting, we heard more than thirty kinds of tunes. Most of these music and singing are influenced by local operas, but they also have their own characteristics. For example, the tune of the Heyang string opera in puppet shows is created based on Qinqiang and Shanxi Bangzi. This tune is called "String Howl Tune" and has a special tragic and passionate mood. In shadow plays, the singing style is richer, such as the famous Luanzhou shadow tune and Leting shadow tune. The singing style is very detailed, and different tunes are selected according to emotional changes, adding beauty to the performance. Shaanxi's "Wan Wan Tune" is a unique tune in shadow tunes, using various different tones to help portray the character of the characters; these music with strong local characteristics and unique style form an important part of puppet shows and shadow plays.

　　Judging from the content, acting skills, and music of the programs in this performance and observation meeting, we can see that Chinese puppet and shadow art has great achievements and characteristics. However, from this performance, we also discovered many shortcomings that currently exist in puppet shows and shadow plays, which urgently need to be improved. For example, in terms of stage image, some programs still retain the forms and performances of small feet and beheading blood; some character shapes are incomplete, most puppets do not have chest cavities, shoulders, and hand shapes; some shapes are sloppy, colors are randomly applied to the face, and the heads and bodies of the main and secondary roles are disproportionate; these greatly reduce the beauty and authenticity of the stage image. In addition, in terms of portraying character personalities, there are also incorrect exaggerations or even distorted descriptions. For example, some plays depict historical heroes as fierce and brutal people, and some plays adopt old stage movements and tunes in the actions and singing of modern characters, producing a ridiculous feeling. In terms of performance, some simply pursue special acting skills, such as using silk, using fireworks, and martial arts that deviate from the plot; some, when carrying out technical improvements in stage image and scenery, one-sidedly pursue realism, making the costumes and props all become gray and old colors, losing the bright colors, decorative beauty, national tradition, and optimistic sentiment. These must be carefully studied and actively improved. The reform of traditional plays must be planned and carried out step by step based on the experience of opera reform in recent years.

　　Puppet shows and shadow plays are comprehensive arts. When carrying out reforms and creations, we must rely on all aspects to consider together. All aspects such as script content, performance form, character modeling and production, performance technology, stage arrangement, lighting effects, and musical effects should be closely coordinated to seek common development and improvement.

　　It is hoped that the cultural authorities of various provinces and cities will provide specific guidance and assistance to the key leadership troupes in sorting out programs and carrying out artistic reforms, so as to create experience and assist general troupes in carrying out reform work. Puppet shows and shadow plays should focus on amateur or semi-professional development, and should not be easily developed into professional and state-owned ones, so as to avoid leaving the original local foundation and forming a tendency of unrealistic advancement. The current work should focus on continuing to explore and sort out the excellent genres and programs of national traditions, exchange the performance and production experience of various places across the country, and require poets, playwrights, opera artists, artists, and musicians to participate in this meaningful work together. Actively create new programs, especially new programs that reflect modern life and are aimed at children, so that puppet shows and shadow plays can become an effective force in educating the people, inspiring the people, and cultivating the next generation in the great era of the motherland's economic construction.

　　我国木偶戏皮影戏的民族特色
　　朱丹
    木偶戏（又称傀儡戏）和皮影戏是我国民间艺术中的一对孪生姊妹，在来源和艺术形式上都有比较接近的地方。它们在我国戏曲史上有着相当悠久的历史，保存的剧种非常多，流传的地域也很广，同是我国最有传统和特色的艺术。
    早在唐宋两代，就有所谓“影子戏”，宋人的笔记中记述很多；当时在制作方法和表演技术上已和今天的皮影戏差不多。木偶戏的起源则更早，在距今两千年前的汉代就已经出现了这种比较原始的戏剧形式。目前全国各地的木偶戏皮影戏，据有史可查的，多半开始于明末清初；其中也有更早的，如福建上杭的木偶戏，在明朝初年就已经开始流行了。
    可是在旧社会这两种民间艺术从来不被重视。全国解放后，在“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针下，各个剧种的艺人都翻了身，木偶戏皮影戏也在各地党和政府的扶植与领导下，获得了某些整顿和发展。五年以来，木偶戏皮影戏在全国各地已结成了一支相当大的队伍；根据现有的二十二个省市的极不完全的统计，即有木偶、皮影班社两千零五十四个，艺人一万一千一百四十七人。
    为了检阅这一支队伍的战斗力量，交流工作经验，并进一步研究今后改进和发展的方针，中华人民共和国文化部今年四月在北京举办了第一届木偶戏皮影戏观摩演出会。到会的有十二个重点省份的代表，演出了很多传统剧目和新剧目。由于这两种艺术形式本身所具备的优点和它们长时期在群众中建立的基础，使它们不仅成为广大人民特别是农民所熟悉和热爱的艺术，而且成为能够被群众自己所掌握的艺术；目前全国各地的木偶戏皮影戏班社，多半是农民自己组织起来的业余的和半职业的艺术团体。
    木偶戏皮影戏观摩演出会一共演出了五十三个剧目，其中以各地原有的传统剧目为多，在内容上，首先是采用历史故事和神话传说为题材，如“蒋干盗书”、“草船借箭”和“断桥”、“火焰山”、“哪吒闹海”等；也有以童话寓言为题材的，如“中山狼”、“鹤与龟”等；还有专门表演木偶皮影特技的“花振芳卖艺”等节目。其次，也有一部分是根据现代生活编写的新内容的节目，如黑龙江的皮影戏“工农联欢”和反映土地改革政策的广东提线木偶“范寿山”等。在专门为儿童看的新节目当中，则有根据动物故事编写的湖南的改良皮影
  “两朋友”、“贪心的猴弟弟”。这些反映现代生活的新编节目，虽然在这次会演中还不够多，在主题上和表现方法上也还存在一些缺点；但这种新的尝试和勇于改进的精神是值得重视和鼓励的。
    由于整个社会的进步和人民觉悟程度的提高，木偶戏皮影戏必须在传统剧目的内容上进行一些必要的改革，并积极创造能够反映现代人民生活的新剧目，才能适应客观的迫切需要。在这样的要求下面，解放后几年来，一部分带有封建迷信和色情毒素的传统剧目已经由各地文化主管部门协同艺人加以取缔和修改；如“阴阳界”、“还魂帕”、“活捉三郎”、“大小争风”等有毒素的剧目，已经不再出现在木偶戏皮影戏的舞台上了。
    在创作新剧目的工作上，这些年来在全国范围内虽然还没有有计划地进行，但各地木偶皮影班社在过去一个时期内已经自动地上演了一批新的节目，特别是皮影戏艺人在一九四九年就演出过“白毛女”和“小二黑结婚”。他们配合着开国以来的大规模政治运动，演出了“一贯害人道”、“二老捐献”、“大家都满意”、“人往高处走”等戏，以及这次在会上演出的许多节目，向农民宣传了过渡时期社会主义改造的道路，并提高和鼓舞了他们的生产热情。
    由于我国的木偶戏皮影戏是来自民间，同时又是和群众的生活和生产斗争息息相关的，所以不管在内容和形式上，都带有极浓厚的生活色彩和地方色彩。在形式上，我国的木偶戏皮影戏是和各地的地方戏曲紧密地结合着的，这是我国木偶戏皮影戏的一个很大的特点。因此，它具有丰富的舞台动作，特别是舞蹈动作，和优美的音乐语言，这是和我国的民族戏曲的传统相一致的。所以很多的传统剧目是用歌舞剧的形式表现出来的，如“小放牛”、“盗仙草”，主题简明生动，语言和动作丰富活泼，富于韵律美，许多场面载歌载舞，甚至使观众觉得这类剧目的剧中人物是最适合于用木偶来演出的。由此证明我国木偶戏皮影戏将能配合着新歌舞剧的发展，创造出自己独有风格的节目来。在刻划人物方面，我国木偶戏皮影戏有着极大的成就。过去有些国家曾有人认为木偶戏只能演喜剧，不能演悲剧；木偶戏的角色只适合于用夸张的形态和幽默的动作来表现讽刺的主题，可是在这次演出的“花亭会”、“二堂舍子”、“西蓬击掌”、“宇宙锋”以及“断桥”等抒情风格的剧目当中，它们都能用细致的动作传达出人物的内心感情，创造了真实的人物性格，使木偶角色和皮影人在舞台上都变成有血有肉的活人。
    其次，我国的木偶戏皮影戏也是表现喜剧的能手，善于演幽默讽刺的主题，使用起夸张的手法来是十分大胆的。如在“火焰山”一剧中，表现了孙悟空钻进牛魔王肚子里面的画面；在“快活林”里面，描写武松把蒋门神的女人纳入缸中，后来由店伙把缸打破，才从缺口里面救出这个女人。此外在
  “水漫金山”、“收三徒”等戏中，借用神魔变化的情节，把许多特异的形象和动作搬上舞台，增加了戏的浪漫气氛和喜剧效果。另外，由于木偶戏的舞台限制较少，可以利用许多在一般戏剧舞台上难以作到的表现方法；如“中山狼”中的狼可以说话，赵简子可以骑在马上穿场而过，这些不仅无损于整个舞台美，而且增加戏的真实效果。
    最后，在我国木偶戏皮影戏舞台上经常出现一些紧张激烈的武打场面，和木偶、皮影特有的技术；如“蜈蚣岭”、“快活林”中的武术、“闹天宫”中的腾云驾雾、“水漫金山”中的水斗，都表现得非常精采。“大名府”中的耍葫芦、玩蛇、舞狮；“闹龙宫”中的龙战，以及“水擒庞德”中的水中大战，“火烧濮阳”中的烟火都不是在平常的舞台上可以做到的。在有些戏中，木偶和皮影人可以穿衣、结带、解钮口、翻根斗、打旋子，克服了木偶和皮影人动作不容易灵活的先天缺陷，这些都表现了中国木偶皮影艺人的高度技巧和卓越的匠心。
    中国木偶皮影在制作和造型上，一贯着重于单纯灵活并富于装饰趣味，如广东木偶的眼睛，不仅能上下开阖，而且能左顾右盼，帮助内心表情；湖南、四川木偶四肢及手部都很灵活，能接取物件；黑龙江的皮影则能迈步走路，开口说话。这些都是多少年来艺人苦心创造的结果。在造型上，中国木偶及皮影人都有自己的特点，福建老艺人江加走雕刻出来的木偶头部，个个有突出的性格，并且具有他自己独创的艺术风格。青海等地的皮影也表现了特殊的图案美。
    现在在木偶皮影的制作技术上各地都已经大加改进，如湖南改良皮影的增加推台，在银幕上消灭影签子，在影人的操作上添用拉线的设备，这些技术性的改良工作，使我们的艺术制作更加科学化，这是应该提倡的。
    木偶戏皮影戏的音乐和歌唱也是异常丰富的，从这次会演中，我们听到三十种以上的曲调。这些音乐和歌唱大部分受地方戏曲的影响，但也各有自己的特点，如木偶戏中的郃阳线戏的曲调，就是根据秦腔和山西梆子创造出来的，这种曲调称为“线吼调”，具有一种悲壮激昂的特殊情调。在皮影戏中，唱腔更加丰富，如有名的滦州影调和乐亭影调，唱腔分工极细密，并根据情感变化，选用不同曲牌，给演出增加美感。陕西“碗碗腔”是影调中一种独有的曲调，用各种不同的音调分门别类地帮助刻划人物的性格；这些具有浓厚的地方色彩和独特风格的音乐，形成了木偶戏皮影戏中的一个重要的组成部分。
    从这一次观摩演出各剧目的内容、演技、音乐等方面来检阅我国木偶皮影艺术，可看出它们是有很大的成就和特点的。但是从这一次演出中，我们也发现了目前在木偶戏皮影戏中存在着的不少缺点，迫切地须要加以改进。如在舞台形象方面，有些剧目至今还保留着小脚、及杀头流血的形态和表演；有的人物形体不完整，大部分木偶没有胸腔、肩部和手形；有的造型潦草，在面部乱涂色彩，并显出主要角色和次要角色头部和身躯大小的不相称；这些都大大地减低了舞台形象的美观和真实性。另外在刻划人物性格方面，也有作了不正确的夸张甚至歪曲的描写的，如有的戏把历史上的英雄描绘成凶恶残暴的人，有的戏在现代人物的动作和歌唱方面，采取旧的舞台动作和腔调，产生滑稽可笑的感觉。在表演方面，有的单纯追求特殊的演技，如使彩、用烟火、脱离剧情的武打等；有的在进行舞台形象和布景的技术改进时，片面地追求写实，使服装道具都变成灰暗陈旧的颜色，丧失了色彩鲜明装饰艳丽的民族传统和乐观情调。这些都是必须加以周密地研究和积极地改进的。对于传统剧目的改革，必须是有计划的，根据几年来戏曲改革的经验，有步骤地稳步进行。
    木偶戏皮影戏是综合性的艺术，在进行改革和创造时必须依靠各方面协同考虑，如剧本内容、演出形式、人物造型和制作、表演技术、舞台布置、灯光作用、音乐效果等各方面都应该紧密地取得配合，求得共同的发展和提高。
    希望各省市文化主管部门对重点领导的班社，在整理剧目和进行艺术改革上加以具体的指导和帮助，以便创造经验，协助一般的班社进行改革工作。木偶戏皮影戏应注重业余的或半职业化的发展，不要轻易发展为职业化的和国营的，以免离开原有的地方基础，形成脱离实际的冒进倾向。目前的工作应该着重于继续发掘和整理民族传统的优秀剧种和剧目，交流全国各地的表演和制作的经验，要求诗人、剧作家、戏曲家、美术家、音乐家一齐参加这一项有意义的工作。积极创造新的剧目，尤其是反映现代生活以及以儿童为对象的新剧目，使木偶戏皮影戏在祖国进行经济建设的伟大年代中成为教育人民、鼓舞人民和培养下一代的有效的力量。
