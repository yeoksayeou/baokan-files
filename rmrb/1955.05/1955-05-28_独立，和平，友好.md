　　Independence, Peace, Friendship
　　Zhao Puchu, Secretary-General of the Chinese Buddhist Delegation to Burma
    As the Chinese Buddhist Delegation to Burma was about to depart from Beijing, a friend cited the story of Sudhana's pilgrimage south in search of friends from the Avatamsaka Sutra to wish us success. In the story, Sudhana was a sage who traveled south to make good connections, visiting many virtuous friends, hearing many beautiful words, and increasing his wisdom and strength. We had no doubts about our friend's wishes, because we fully understood the sincere desire for friendship that the Chinese Buddhists and the Chinese people wanted to convey, and we fully believed that there were many, many virtuous friends waiting for us at our destination. And so, we set off southward.

    A month's worth of observations should not be considered little. In Yangon, we watched the "Water Splashing Festival," where citizens, both men and women, dressed in finery, sang and danced with great joy, and splashed water on each other to their hearts' content. We climbed Mandalay Hill and paid our respects to King Mindon's Tripitaka stone inscriptions. We sailed for four days on the beautiful Irrawaddy River, and we paid homage to dozens of pagodas. The Shwezigon Pagoda and the Ananda Temple, built by King Anawrahta and his son, who unified Burma nine hundred years ago, still retain their solemn and magnificent structure and decorations after recent renovations, fully expressing the wisdom and vigor of the ancient Burmese people. In Bagan, there are still thousands of pagodas standing, one of the treasures of ancient Eastern art. There, various pagodas stand tall, competing in splendor and uniqueness. You can not only appreciate the unique artistic forms and styles of the Burmese nation, see Indian-style architecture and sculpture, but also see Chinese-style pagodas. When we saw the appearance of the Upali Ordination Hall and the statues and murals inside, we felt as if we were admiring the works of the Tang and Song dynasties of China. Here, we saw valuable physical evidence of the cultural exchange between China and Burma nine hundred years ago.

    I will not talk much about Burma's glorious culture and art here, because my responsibility should be to first report to our people the thoughts and feelings of Burmese Buddhists and the Burmese people.

    The thoughts and feelings of the Burmese people are easy to understand, that is: national independence, peace, and international friendship.

    In the central district of Yangon, there is a wide street called U Wisara Road, and in the center of the street is a tall monument with a bronze statue, which is the statue of U Wisara. U Wisara was arrested and imprisoned in 1930 for advocating against colonialism. In prison, he refused to wear prison clothes, insisted on keeping his monastic robes, and died after a 156-day hunger strike in protest. His death aroused the indignation of the people of the whole country and promoted the movement of the Burmese monks and laypeople to fight for national independence. We went to the Martyrs' Mausoleum in Mandalay to lay flowers and pay our respects. There lie the remains of seventeen martyrs, all of whom sacrificed their lives in an anti-colonial demonstration in 1938, seven of whom were monks.

    These are just two examples of the many moving historical facts of the heroic struggle of thousands upon thousands of Burmese Buddhists and Burmese people for national independence in the past few decades. Our activities in Burma this time were all in religious settings, but we can easily see their national feelings, their spirit of loving the motherland, and their will to oppose colonialism from the religious feelings of the Burmese people. All of this is very sympathetic and moving to a Chinese person who has been oppressed by foreign powers.

    The Burmese people love their motherland, and the Burmese people also love peace. I will not forget the traces of the destroyed Buddha statues and the bullet marks on the Shwemawdaw Pagoda left by Japanese bombardment during the Japanese occupation, which my companion Tekin Lwin showed me. These past events constantly remind Burmese Buddhists and the Burmese people to devote themselves to the cause of maintaining peace. When we spoke at gatherings in various parts of Burma, hundreds and thousands of gentle smiling faces greeted us. Whenever we asked everyone to work together for the cause of peace and to wish the Burmese people and the people of the world peace and happiness, hundreds and thousands of people said in unison: "Sadhu, Sadhu, Sadhu" (meaning "Excellent, Excellent, Excellent"). After each of our speeches, we would always hear the deep and sincere songs of the masses, wishing for the friendship between the two peoples, wishing for world peace, and wishing for the complete fulfillment of all the good wishes of the delegation.

    At the welcome meeting of the All-Burma Young Monks Association, the honorary chairman and secretary-general of the association delivered enthusiastic and sincere speeches advocating peace and friendship, which moved the entire audience. Before leaving, they also presented our delegation with a Pali Tripitaka, each volume of which was affixed with the inscription "Consolidate World Peace."

    We personally experienced that due to the common desire of the two peoples to maintain peace, the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples has been further enhanced. China and Burma are not only close neighbors, but the peoples of the two countries also have a long history of friendly exchanges. Among the Buddhists of China and Burma, there has long been a relationship of Dharma transmission. In the middle of the fifth century AD, the Venerable Buddhaghosa, who went from Ceylon to Burma to propagate Buddhism, sent his disciple Sanghabhara to China at the same time to propagate Buddhism, which shows that the Buddhists of our two countries had a relationship in the transmission of the Dharma even when they had no direct contact. As for among the people, the compatriots in various places told us that they get along very well with the Burmese people. When Prime Minister U Nu went to the airport to see us off, he said to us: "There are many foreign nationals in Burma, but the Burmese people get along best with the Chinese nationals." This is indeed the case. Since the prime ministers of China and Burma visited each other last year, a new element has been added to our friendship. The statement of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between the two countries, the joint efforts between the two countries to promote peace in Asia and the world and the achievements they have already made, especially the achievements of the recent Asian-African Conference, have greatly encouraged the desire of the two peoples to seek friendly cooperation. All our observations in Burma prove that the Burmese people's desire to strengthen the friendship between the two countries is as sincere as ours.

    The delegation was warmly welcomed by Burmese Buddhists and people from all walks of life everywhere in Burma, and received the cordial hospitality and assistance of the Burmese government. Prime Minister U Nu and Minister U Win of the Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Union of Burma personally greeted and saw off the delegation as Buddhists. The veneration received by the various masters in the delegation was even more grand.

    On the day of the Burmese New Year (April 17), we offered a meal to the monks at the Mahamuni Temple in Yangon. The 83-year-old Mahamuni Elder voluntarily invited the elders of eight other large temples to meet us, and these eight elders were all nationally renowned leaders in the monastic community. The followers of the Mahamuni Elder presented Master Xirao Gyatso, the head of our delegation, with a golden umbrella, which is used by the great masters of Burma. The elder requested that Master Xirao use this umbrella wherever he goes after returning to China, to express the sincere respect and love of the Burmese people. He also held the rosary we presented and said: "I use this rosary every day, and I remember you every day." These were friendly words from a sincere heart.

    The delegation brought a gift to present to the Burmese Buddhist community, and the ceremony for accepting the gift was very grand. The grand ceremony expressed a grand intention, expressing the deep friendship between the Buddhist communities of China and Burma and the peoples of the two countries.

    However, the friendship between the Buddhist communities of China and Burma and between the peoples of China and Burma is not something that no one wants to undermine. Our Burmese friends told us that there are some foreign elements in Burma who pretend to sympathize with Buddhism and come to the Buddhists to spread rumors, saying that China "no longer has" Buddhism, and that monks have been "expelled" and "killed." In this way, they create rumors, attempting to use religious sentiments to create estrangement and division between the Chinese and Burmese peoples. Even while we were in Burma, foreign provocateurs were publishing news in the newspapers they hired, saying that the lamas in Tibet "cannot live in peace" and are "fleeing one after another," and even posting photos. However, some members of our delegation recognized that one of the people in the photos wearing lama clothing was actually a Mongolian lama who had left his homeland decades ago and had now gone to the United States. The United States is using his photo to create rumors and slander our country's policy of protecting freedom of religious belief. In fact, Master Xirao Gyatso, the head of our delegation, is a Tibetan lama, and the Living Buddha Galazang, one of the members, is a Mongolian lama. The Burmese people have told us one after another that the various news they have heard about this kind of thing in the past few years has now been proven to be completely rumors by the facts. However, the Buddhists of our two countries still have to be vigilant and not allow anyone to undermine the friendly unity between the Buddhists of our two countries and the peoples of our two countries.

　　独立，和平，友好
　　中国佛教访缅代表团秘书长　赵朴初
    当中国佛教访缅代表团将要由北京动身到缅甸去的时候，有一位朋友举出华严经上善财童子南行求友的故事来祝愿我们成功。原来故事中的善财童子是一位圣者，为了广结善缘，他向南方旅行，参访了许多善友，听到了许多美妙的语言，增加了许多智慧和力量。我们对这位朋友的祝愿是没有怀疑的。因为我们完全了解我们所要带去的中国佛教徒和中国人民殷勤求友的心情，我们也完全相信我们所要去的地方，有许多许多善友在等待着。我们就这样向南方出发了。
    一个月的见闻，不应该说少。我们在仰光观赏了“泼水节”，盛装的男女市民们兴高采烈地唱歌跳舞，淋漓尽致地互相泼水。我们登临了曼德勒山，瞻仰了明顿王的三藏石碑；我们在美丽的伊洛瓦底江上航行了四天；我们朝拜了几十处宝塔。九百年前统一全缅的安诺罗佗王父子所建造的瑞喜宫塔和阿难陀塔，经过最近修缮后，依然保持其庄严华丽的结构和雕饰，充分表达出古代缅甸人民的智慧和魄力。在蒲甘，现在还存留数千座宝塔，这是古代东方艺术的宝藏之一。在那里，各式各样的宝塔争奇斗异地到处耸立着。你不仅可以欣赏缅甸民族特有的艺术形式和作风，看到印度形式的建筑和雕塑，而且还可以看到中国形式的塔像。当我们看到优波离戒坛的外貌和内部的塑像和壁画时，我们仿佛是在欣赏我国唐宋人的作品。我们在这里看到了九百年前中缅两国文化交流的宝贵的物证。
    我在这里不多谈缅甸的光辉的文化艺术，因为我的责任应当是首先向我国人民报道缅甸佛教徒和缅甸人民的思想和感情。
    缅甸人民的思想感情是容易知道的，那就是：民族独立、和平和国际友好。
    仰光市中区有一条广阔的街道叫做宇维萨耶路，街心有一座很高的纪念碑，碑上立着一尊铜像，那便是宇维萨耶法师的像。宇维萨耶法师在一九三○年因宣传反对殖民主义被捕下狱，在狱中他拒绝穿着囚衣，坚持不改僧服，绝食抗议一百五十六天而死。他的死引起了全国人民的激愤，推进了缅甸僧俗人民争取民族独立的运动。我们曾前往曼德勒的烈士岗献花致敬。那里埋葬着十七位烈士的忠骨，这十七位都是在一九三八年的一次反殖民主义示威中牺牲了生命的，其中有七位是僧人。
    这不过是千千万万缅甸佛教徒和缅甸人民过去数十年为民族独立而英勇斗争的许多可歌可泣的史实中的两个例子。我们这次在缅甸的活动，都是在宗教的场合，但我们很容易从缅甸人民的宗教感情中看出他们的民族感情，他们的热爱祖国的精神，他们的反对殖民主义的意志。这一切，对于一个曾经受过外国压迫的中国人来说，是非常令人同情而感动的。
    缅甸人民爱祖国，缅甸人民也同样地爱和平。我不会忘记我的同伴德钦卢敏指给我看的在日本占领期间被炮火毁坏的佛像和高慕道塔上累累的机关枪弹的痕迹。这些往事，时时刻刻在提醒缅甸的佛教徒和缅甸人民致力于维护和平的事业。我们在缅甸各地的集会中讲话时，成百成千的温和的笑脸迎着我们；每当我们要求大家为和平事业共同努力，和祝愿缅甸人民、全世界人民和平幸福时，成百成千的人同声说着：“萨度、萨度、萨度”（意思是“善哉、善哉、善哉”）。每当我们讲完之后，我们总会听到群众的深沉恳挚的歌声，祝愿着两国人民的友好，祝愿着世界的和平，祝愿着代表团的一切善愿悉皆成就。
    在全缅青年僧伽协会欢迎我们的会议上，协会的名誉主席和秘书长发表了主张和平、友好的热情恳切、感动全场的讲话。临走他们并赠送我们代表团一部巴利文藏经，每一本上面都贴着“巩固世界和平”的赠词。
    我们亲身体会到，由于两国人民这种维护和平的共同愿望，中缅人民传统的友谊更加增进了。中缅两国不仅是紧密的邻邦，而且两国人民还有历史悠久的友好交往的关系。在中缅两国的佛教徒中间，很早就有了佛法传承的关系。公元五世纪中，从锡兰到缅甸去弘法的佛音尊者，就曾派遣他的弟子僧伽跋罗同时到中国来弘法，这说明我们两国佛教徒甚至在没有直接接触的时候便已经在佛法传承上有了关系。至于在人民中间，各地的侨胞向我们说，他们和缅甸人民相处得很好。吴努总理去机场送别的时候，向我们说：“在缅甸有许多国家的侨民，可是缅甸人民和中国侨民相处得最好。”这是确实的。自从去年中缅两国总理互相访问之后，我们间的友好加上了新的因素。两国间和平共处的五项原则的声明，两国间为促进亚洲和世界和平的共同努力及其已经取得的成就，尤其最近亚非会议的成就，大大鼓舞了两国人民要求友好合作的愿望。我们在缅甸的一切见闻，证明缅甸人民对加强两国友好的心情，是和我们同样地殷切的。
    代表团在缅甸各地，到处受到缅甸佛教徒和各界人民热情洋溢的欢迎，得到缅甸政府的殷勤招待和协助。吴努总理和缅甸联邦政府宗教事务部吴温部长以佛教徒身分亲自迎送代表团。代表团中的各位法师，所受到的敬礼更是隆重。
    缅历元旦那天（四月十七日），我们在仰光的摩宁寺斋僧，八十三岁的摩宁长老自动地代我们邀请了其他八个大寺的长老来和我们相见，这八位长老都是全国知名的僧界领袖。摩宁长老的信徒们赠献我们代表团团长喜饶嘉错大师一把金色的伞，这是缅甸的大法师所用的伞。长老要求喜饶大师回国后，随处往来都用这把伞，以表达缅甸人民敬爱的诚意。他又拿着我们赠送的念珠说：“我每天用这串念珠，我每天忆念你们。”这是出自真诚的心的友好的语言。 
    代表团带了一份礼物赠献给缅甸佛教界，他们接受礼物的仪式是十分隆重的。隆重的仪式，表示着隆重的心意，表示着中缅两国的佛教界和两国人民深厚的友好关系。
    但是，中缅两国佛教界之间和中缅两国人民之间的友谊，并不是没有人想要破坏的。缅甸的朋友们告诉我们，有一些在缅甸的外国分子，装着同情佛教的面孔，来到佛教徒的面前散播谣言，说什么中国已经“没有”佛教了，和尚被“驱逐”、被
  “杀光”了，他们就这样地制造流言，企图利用宗教感情来在中缅人民之间制造隔阂和分裂。甚至当我们在缅甸期间，外国挑拨分子还在他们所雇用的报纸上发表消息，说什么西藏的喇嘛“不能安身”，“纷纷逃亡”，并且还登着照片。可是，我们代表团中有人认出来，照片当中一个穿喇嘛服装的人，原来是一个蒙古的喇嘛，他离开他的故国已有几十年，现在到美国去了。美国就拿着他的照片造谣，诬蔑我国保障宗教信仰自由的政策。事实上，我们代表团团长喜饶嘉错大师就是藏族的喇嘛，团员之一的噶喇藏活佛是蒙族的喇嘛。缅甸人民纷纷告诉我们，这几年来他们所听到的关于这一类的种种消息，现在被事实证明完全是谣言。可是，我们两国佛教徒还得要保持警惕，不让任何人破坏我们两国佛教徒和两国人民间的友好团结。
