　　Hubei Province's largest reservoir, the Shilong Guo Jiang Reservoir, has been successfully completed at the end of April this year, after a year and six months of intensive construction. From now on, the lower reaches of the Sima River will be free from flooding disasters, and the flood burden of the Han River during the flood season can also be partially reduced. The 250,000 mu of farmland of the state-owned 53rd Mechanical Farm and the two counties of Jingshan and Tianmen will be gradually guaranteed irrigation.
　　Shilong Guo Jiang is a gorge where two mountains meet, winding through the southern part of Jingshan County and the upper reaches of the Sima River. Outside the canyon is an endless expanse of hills and plains. Since the remote dike of the Han River collapsed in 1935, floods have engulfed this land. In 1952, the People's Government established the state-owned 53rd Mechanical Farm here. From November 1953, it began to build this large-scale valley reservoir in Shilong Guo Jiang. (Zhang Dabai)

　  湖北省石龙过江水库完工
    湖北省一座最大的水库——石龙过江水库，经过一年零六个月的紧张施工，已在今年四月底胜利竣工。从此司马河下游免除了泛滥灾害，汉江汛期的洪水负担也可以减轻一部分，使国营五三机械农场和京山、天门两县的二十五万亩农田，将逐步得到灌溉保证。
    石龙过江是个两山会合的峡口，蜿蜒于京山县南部、司马河上游，峡谷外面则是一片无际的丘陵和平畈。自一九三五年汉江遥堤倒口，洪水便吞没了这块土地。一九五二年，人民政府在这里创办了国营五三机械农场，一九五三年十一月起，又在石龙过江建筑这座大型的山谷水库。　（张达柏）
