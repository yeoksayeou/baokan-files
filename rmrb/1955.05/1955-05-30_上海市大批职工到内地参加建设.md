　　Shanghai Large Numbers of Workers Go to the Interior to Participate in Construction
    On the evening of the 25th, a special train carrying more than 1,600 workers left Shanghai to participate in construction work in the Northwest region.
    That morning, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee held a grand farewell meeting for them. Song Richang, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, called on the workers at the meeting to carry forward the fine traditions of the Shanghai working class of hard struggle and overcoming difficulties, to go to where socialist construction needs them, and to build new cities, factories, and railways with their labor. He said: Following the departure of the first batch, tens of thousands more Shanghai workers will go to support the construction of the Northwest region. Shanghai's manpower support to the interior is not only necessary for the country's construction cause, but also in line with the policy of Shanghai's own construction and transformation.
    In the past four months of this year, Shanghai has systematically sent talents from various fields to the interior to participate in construction. Among them: more than 3,200 technicians and technical personnel above the fourth grade; more than 300 automobile drivers, automobile repair technicians and skilled workers; and a total of more than 13,000 managers, deputy managers, economic staff, engineering and technical personnel, and skilled workers above the third grade from state-owned construction enterprises. From the end of 1953 to now, nearly 40,000 people from the four construction engineering companies and one construction machinery supply station directly under the East China Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering have been moved to Changchun, Xi'an, Luoyang and other places in complete sets. The personnel of another construction engineering company directly under this bureau are also gradually being transferred outwards. Along with these workers going to the interior, there are also many employees in industries such as hairdressing and bathhouses.

　　上海市大批职工到内地参加建设
    二十五日晚上，一列专车载着一千六百多名工人离开上海去参加西北地区的建设工作。
    当天上午，上海市人民委员会为他们举行了盛大的欢送会。上海市副市长宋日昌在会上号召工人们发扬上海工人阶级艰苦奋斗、克服困难的优良传统，到社会主义建设所需要的地方去，用自己的劳动建设起新的城市、工厂和铁路。他说：在第一批出发之后，紧接着还将有成千上万的上海工人前去支援西北地区的建设。上海从人力上支援内地，不仅为国家建设事业所必需，同时也是符合于上海本身建设改造的方针的。
    在今年的四个多月中，上海曾有计划地输送了各方面的人材到内地去参加建设。其中有：四级以上技术工人和技术人员三千二百多人；汽车驾驶员、汽车修理技术人员和技术工人三百多人；国营建筑企业的经理、副经理、经济工作人员、工程技术人员和三级以上技术工人共一万三千多人。从一九五三年年底到现在，建筑工程部华东工程管理总局直属的四个建筑工程公司和一个建筑机械供应总站近四万人，已分别整套地搬到长春、西安、洛阳等地。这个局直属的另一个建筑工程公司的人员也在逐步向外输送中。随着这些工人前往内地的，还有很多理发、澡堂等行业的职工。
