In This "Kingdom"
　　Xu Yi

　　Outside the West Gate of Heze, a small city in Shandong Province, lies a large expanse of red-tiled houses. This is the Heze No. 1 Normal School.

　　Principal Wang Guanyi of this school certainly has some airs about him. He doesn't readily meet with people; even those within the school must first have the secretary petition him, and only after approval can they see him. This system of not being able to see the principal without authorization was personally announced by the principal at a general meeting of more than 800 teachers and students. As a result, some teachers at the school haven't spoken to the principal for more than half a year, even though they live in the same courtyard. Heze No. 1 Normal School and Heze No. 2 Middle School are only across the street from each other, but if the principal of the No. 2 Middle School wants to see Principal Wang at the No. 1 Normal School, he must also abide by this system personally established by Principal Wang.

　　The school buildings of Heze No. 1 Normal School are not very spacious. Principal Wang even wrote in a report to higher authorities that 200 students had become ill because the school had too few houses. But Principal Wang, in addition to his office and reception room, also had a temporary rest room; and in order to easily issue orders, he also established a broadcasting room. Regardless of summer or winter, whenever Principal Wang felt it necessary to lecture the teachers and students of the school, he would gather the teachers and students in the courtyard, while he himself sat comfortably in the broadcasting room, leisurely lecturing. One day, the north wind was blowing fiercely, and the students were listening to Principal Wang's "lecture" in the courtyard. As he was talking, the broadcast equipment suddenly broke down. Principal Wang, sitting in the room, of course couldn't see how cold the students were: some were covering their ears, and some were stamping their feet. He also couldn't hear the students' reactions: "Oh, Principal, please speak less!" "It's not cold sitting in the room!" Naturally, he didn't know that the broadcast equipment had broken down and no sound was coming out. He was still slowly reciting the speech.

　　"Stop, Principal Wang, the broadcast equipment is broken," said the comrade in charge of the broadcast equipment.

　　"Okay," Principal Wang finally stopped. After a while, the broadcast equipment was repaired. But Principal Wang forgot where he had left off. After asking the students, he lazily continued to speak.

　　Principal Wang is very good at cultivating his own "prestige" among those simple young students. Take "alumni day" for example. This is something that many schools have: at an appropriate time, inviting graduated students back to the school to talk about their work situation after leaving the school, as a reference for improving teaching and strengthening the connection between teachers and students, graduates and current students. This was originally a very good thing. But how did Principal Wang preside over this school's "alumni day"? It turned out to be inviting them to a meal, saying a few words before the banquet such as I cultivated you for three years, you forgot about me as soon as you left the school, I really miss you, and so on. Some students would praise him a bit, and he would happily chuckle, and the "alumni day" would be over. Principal Wang also liked to have students write so-called "letters to the principal." Some students wrote some imprudent words, such as "great principal," "Long live Principal Wang," and so on. In principle, the principal should feel a bit uncomfortable after reading this, but he was full of joy, saying: "Good student, good student!"

　　Principal Wang Guanyi really has many ways to enhance his own "reputation." The school is plastered with many famous sayings of leaders, including Principal Wang's own "famous sayings": "Scientific allocation of time," with Wang Guanyi's name written below. Sometimes when students were standing there reading these famous sayings, he would often smile behind them.

　　Principal Wang also has a set of "skills" for dealing with the school's cadres. In 1953, comrades from the Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Education came to their school to inspect financial work and discovered that a certain entertainment expense should not have been reimbursed. Principal Wang said nonchalantly on the spot:

　　"Wastefulness, I should also be responsible, it's my bureaucracy. The general affairs department should be stricter in the future."

　　"These unreasonable expenses were all personally approved by you!" said Xu Qingfeng, the head of the general affairs section.

　　Principal Wang saw that this meeting seemed to be criticizing him, so he turned his face and said:

　　"Okay, this meeting is a bit off! Xu Qingfeng, you also have problems! You purchased grain through illegal means during the unified purchase and sale. This is not the attitude towards leadership. Today's meeting ends here."

　　The meeting broke up unhappily. Problems also arose. Zhou Lei, deputy section chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the Heze Prefectural Commissioner's Office, did not seriously examine Wang Guanyi's work, but instead chimed in after the meeting, saying:

　　"Comrade Xu Qingfeng, regardless of whether what you said at the meeting was right or wrong, your attitude towards Principal Wang was incorrect, and therefore you should be suspended from your duties to conduct a self-criticism."

　　Xu Qingfeng did not purchase grain through illegal means. Merely because he expressed his opinion on Principal Wang's incorrect explanation at the work inspection meeting, "hurting" the leader's "face," he was suspended from his duties to conduct a self-criticism. Xu Qingfeng wrote a self-criticism for three or four months. How was it finally handled? Principal Wang came up with more ideas, saying, let's give him a work transfer as a punishment: the Commissioner's Office approved it, and Xu Qingfeng left the No. 1 Normal School.

　　Sun Rixin, the director of teaching affairs, was more willing to offer opinions, so Wang Guanyi felt that this person was "too thorny" and "difficult to lead" and was determined to have him leave the school. He ran to the Propaganda Department of the Heze Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and said: "This comrade is very capable and should be promoted..." The Propaganda Department agreed with Wang Guanyi's opinion. The Commissioner's Office really transferred Sun Rixin, and Wang Guanyi went to the Heze Prefectural Commissioner's Office and said: "Heze No. 1 Normal School is a key school in the province, why only transfer my strong cadres!" Wang Guanyi went to all the agencies he should go to, and came back and said to Sun Rixin: "Oh, comrade! I couldn't keep you even though I tried to! You being here saves me so much worry!" Teaching Director Sun Rixin was thus "promoted" away.

　　The students of Heze No. 1 Normal School gradually recognized the true face of their principal, and so accusations and denunciations of Wang Guanyi were sent out from the school in droves. From last spring to this spring, the secretary of the Heze Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the leading comrades of the Heze Prefectural Commissioner's Office did not know how many times they talked to Wang Guanyi and pointed out the seriousness of his mistakes. Seeing that things were not good, Wang Guanyi expressed to the leaders that he would "humbly" examine himself, especially in front of the secretary of the local committee. Principal Wang's self-criticism report was only recently sent to the directly affiliated organs committee of the Heze Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The content of the self-criticism report was to explain "several misunderstandings." The directly affiliated organs committee of the Heze Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specifically convened a meeting to criticize him. But Wang Guanyi began to take credit at this meeting:

　　"Heze No. 1 Normal School is a key school in the province and has been praised by the province several times. Because of this, my work is very busy, and I have not considered personal issues at all. I rarely even go to the streets, and I am so busy that I rarely wash my feet..." He took off his hat and touched his not-so-long hair, and then said: "I didn't even bother to get a haircut, and my communication officer repeatedly urged me, saying: Principal Wang, you should get a haircut. Oh, only then did I think of getting a haircut." Look, what kind of self-criticism is this? The comrades were not satisfied, but he took on an aggressive tone and said:

　　"I have discussed these misunderstandings with the secretary of the local committee and the commissioner."

　　Just talking is not enough. What is important is to correct oneself, to honestly wash one's brain and get rid of that rusty thinking!

　　在这个“王国”里
　　许义
    在山东省菏泽这个小城市西关外，有一大片红色的瓦房。这就是菏泽第一师范学校。
    这个学校的王贯一校长可真有些气派哩。他不轻易见人，即使是校内的人，也得先由秘书向他请示，经批准后才能见到他。这个不能擅自见校长的制度，是校长亲自在八百多人的师生大会上宣布过的，因此学校的教员有半年多没有和校长说过话的，虽然他们都住在一个院子里。菏泽第一师范学校和菏泽第二中学只有一路之隔，第二中学的校长如果到第一师范学校见王校长，也要遵照王校长亲手订下的这个制度。
    菏泽第一师范学校的校舍不很宽敞，王校长在给上级机关的报告书上也曾写过，因学校房子太少，曾有二百名学生得病。可是王校长呢，除了办公室、会客室之外，还有一间临时休息室；为了便于发号施令，他还建立了一个广播室。不管夏天或冬天，王校长认为需要向学校的师生训话的时候，就把师生集合在院子里，他自己却舒服地坐在广播室里，把腿一跷，就慢声细语地“训”起来了。有一天，北风刮得很紧，学生们在院子里听王校长“训话”，讲着讲着，广播器忽然坏了。王校长坐在屋子里，当然看不见学生冷得什么样子：有的捂着耳朵，有的跺脚。他也听不见学生的反映：“唉呀，校长少讲会吧！”“坐在屋子里可不冷呢！”自然，他也不知道广播器出了毛病，外面听不到声音了。他还在慢声细语地念着讲演稿。
    “停停吧，王校长，广播器坏了。”管理广播器的同志说。
      “好。”王校长这才停下来了。隔了一会儿，广播器修理好了。可是王校长却忘记讲到了什么地方。问过学生之后，他才又懒洋洋地接着讲起来了。
    王校长很会在那些纯朴的青年学生中培养自己的“威信”。就拿“返校节”来说吧，这本来是许多学校都有的：在适当的时候，邀请毕业的学生回到学校来，谈谈出校后的工作情况，作为改进教学的参考，加强师生之间、毕业生和在校生之间的联系，这原是很好的事情。可是王校长是怎样主持这个学校的“返校节”的呢？原来是请一顿客，在筵席前说一阵什么我培养你们三年了，你们一出学校就把我忘了，我真想念你们呀，等等。有的学生歌颂他一番，他就得意地呵呵一乐，“返校节”就算完了。王校长还很喜欢要学生写什么“上校长书”。有的学生写了一些不知轻重的话，什么“伟大的校长”啦、“王校长万岁”啦，等等。按理说，校长看了应该感到有点不自在的，但他却满心地高兴，说：“好学生，好学生！”
    王贯一校长提高自己“声誉”的办法可真是多。学校里贴着不少领袖的名言，其中也有王校长的“名言”：“科学的支配时间”，下面写着王贯一题。有时学生们站在那里念这些名言的时候，他常在后面抿着嘴笑。
    王校长对付学校的干部也很有一套“本事”。一九五三年，山东省文教厅的同志到他们学校来检查财务工作，发现有一笔招待费不应报销。王校长当场满不在意地说：
    “浪费，我也要负责任，是我官僚主义，总务部门以后要严格一些。”
      “咱们这些不合理的开支，都是你亲手批准的呀！”总务科长徐清峰说。
    王校长看到这个会议好像在批评他了，于是就翻脸说：
    “好，这个会议有点不对头呀！徐清峰你还有问题哩！统购统销时你套购粮食。你这不是对领导的态度，今天会议就开到这里。”
    会议不欢而散了。问题也随着发生了。菏泽专员公署的民政科副科长周磊，不去认真检查王贯一的工作，会后却帮腔说：
      “徐清峰同志，不管你在会上说的对不对，你对王校长的态度是不正确的，因此应当停职检讨。”
    徐清峰并没有套购粮食的行为，仅仅是因为在这次检查工作的会议上对王校长的不正确解释提出了意见，“伤”了领导人的“面子”，而被停职检讨了。徐清峰检讨了三四个月，到底怎样处理呢？还是王校长出的点儿多，他说，给他个调动工作的处分吧：专员公署批准了，徐清峰离开了第一师范学校。
    教导主任孙日新比较敢于提意见，王贯一就觉得这个人“太扎手”“不好领导”，一心想让他离开这个学校。他跑到中共菏泽地方委员会宣传部说：“这个同志能力很强，应当提拔……”宣传部同意了王贯一的意见。专员公署真的调孙日新了，王贯一又到菏泽专员公署里说：“菏泽第一师范学校是省里的重点学校，为啥光调我的强干部呀！”王贯一应走的机关都走到了，回来又对孙日新说：“哎呀，同志！我挽留你可留不下呀！你在这里我省多少心事呀！”教导主任孙日新就这样被“提拔”走了。
    菏泽第一师范学校的学生们，慢慢地认识了他们这位校长的真面貌，于是对王贯一的控告信、检举信，纷纷从学校发出来了。从去年的春天到今年的春天，中共菏泽地方委员会的书记和菏泽专员公署的领导同志，不知找王贯一谈了多少次，并指出了他的错误的严重性。王贯一看事儿不妙，曾向领导人表示要“虚心”检查，特别是在地委书记的面前。王校长的检查报告，最近才送到中共菏泽地方委员会的直属机关委员会。检查报告的内容是解释
  “几个误会问题”。中共菏泽地方委员会直属机关委员会又专门召开会议对他进行了批评。而王贯一却在这个会议上表起功来了：
      “菏泽第一师范学校是省里的重点学校，曾为省里数度表扬，由于这样我的工作是十分繁忙的，我毫没有考虑过个人的问题。我连大街都很少去，忙得脚也很少洗……”他摘下帽子摸着并不长的头发，接着说：“连发也顾不得理，我的通讯员再三催我说：王校长，你该理发了。嗷，这我才想起理发来了。”瞧，这叫什么检讨呢？同志们不满意，可是他却拿出咄咄逼人的口气说：
      “关于这些误会问题，我和地委书记、专员都谈过了。”
    光谈过是不行的。重要的是要改正，要老老实实地洗洗脑筋，把那种生了锈的思想丢掉！
