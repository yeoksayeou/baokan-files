Reject the Dishonest Self-Criticism
    Yu Mengxian
      The comrades at our Shandong Provincial Middle School Teacher Training School were extremely angered after reading Hu Feng's lengthy and evasive "My Self-Criticism." Hu Feng has repeatedly rewritten his self-criticism, embellishing and glossing over it, but he cannot deceive the people's eyes. His self-criticism is hypocritical; he has not spoken from the heart.
    He said, "The root of my mistake is that I regarded the revolutionary nature and stance of the petty bourgeoisie as the revolutionary nature and stance of the working class, confusing the fundamental differences between them." Why did he reduce the seriousness of his mistake to this extent? Did he merely regard the revolutionary nature and stance of the petty bourgeoisie as the revolutionary nature and stance of the working class? Hu Feng can be said to have been a "powerful figure" who has been "galloping" in the literary world for many years. Poet, writer, critic, self-proclaimed "organizer of literary work," etc. He has worn many "home" titles. Could it be that he cannot even distinguish between the thoughts of the working class and the petty bourgeoisie? Obviously, he is playing tricks on us, attempting to confuse our vision, avoid the essence, and talk about the surface. What is this if not deception?
    Hu Feng also said: "If it were not for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I personally would not have found a place to settle down in the past twenty years." From here, how much like he pretends to be, really looking like he is repaying the favor! But we want to ask: Since the Party cares about you so much, why don't you tell the Party the truth? Why don't you talk about your anti-Party nature? We will not believe this pitiful, fake confession that you are putting on. We hope that Hu Feng and those who have been deceived by Hu Feng will quickly honestly confess to the people. The people have different attitudes towards those who can recognize their mistakes and those who stubbornly resist to the end.

　  把不老实的检讨打回去
    于孟贤
      我们山东省中学教师进修学校的同志们读了胡风的洋洋万余言的、避重就轻的“我的自我批判”，真是气愤极了。胡风一再地改写他的检讨，装璜涂抹，都蒙蔽不了人民的眼睛。他的检查，是虚伪的，他没有谈出真心话来。
    他说：“我的错误底根源是，把小资产阶级的革命性和立场当作了工人阶级的革命性和立场，混淆了它们中间的原则的区别”。他为什么把自己的错误的严重性降低到这样程度呢？他仅仅是把小资产阶级革命性和立场当作了工人阶级革命性和立场吗？胡风可以说是一个多年来在文艺界“驰骋”的
  “猛人”了。诗人啦，作家啦，批评家啦，自封的
  “文学工作的组织者”啦，等等“家”的称号，他是戴了不少的，难道他连工人阶级和小资产阶级的思想都分不清楚吗？显然，他是在向我们玩花招，是企图混乱我们的视线，避开本质，谈表面。这不是欺骗是什么？
    胡风又说：“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的。”从这里看，胡风装得多么像呀，真是感恩图报的样子！但是我们要问：既然党对你这样关怀，为什么你还不向党说实话呢？你反党的本质为什么不谈呢？我们对你装出来的这种可怜相的假忏悔，是不会相信的。我们希望胡风和受胡风欺骗的人赶快老老实实地向人民交代吧，人民对能够认识自己错误的人和对顽抗到底的人，是有不同态度的。
