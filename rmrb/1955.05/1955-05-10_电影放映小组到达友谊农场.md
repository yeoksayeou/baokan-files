　　Film Screening Team Arrives at Friendship Farm
    The film screening team dispatched by the Propaganda Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture has arrived at the state-owned Friendship Farm. They screened the Soviet film "The First Spring" and the Chinese films "Reconnaissance Across the River," "Taking Huashan Mountain by Strategy," and "On the Wasteland" for the young tractor drivers who are reclaiming land on the grassland in various divisions of the farm. They will also screen films such as "The Caravan Rings in the Mountains" and "Iron Transport Line" for the farm's employees.

    The film "The First Spring," which records the heroic and selfless labor of young Soviet land reclaimers, greatly inspired the enthusiasm for labor among the employees of the state-owned Friendship Farm. Korean youth tractor driver Jin Guozhong said: We must learn from the example of the Soviet youth and do a better job of completing our land reclamation task this year. On the night of May 3rd, their group completed the land reclamation task with excellent results of 4.68 hectares (quota of 3.5 hectares) and a saving of 9.66 kilograms of fuel.

　　电影放映小组到达友谊农场
    由中央农业部宣传总局派出的电影放映小组到达了国营友谊农场。他们在农场的各个分场为正在草原上进行垦荒工作的青年拖拉机手们放映了苏联影片“第一个春天”和我国影片“渡江侦察记”、“智取华山”、“在荒地上”。他们还将为农场职工们映出“山间铃响马帮来”和“钢铁运输线”等影片。
    记录苏联青年垦荒者们英勇忘我劳动的影片“第一个春天”，大大鼓舞了国营友谊农场职工们的劳动热情。朝鲜族青年拖拉机手金国钟说：我们一定要学习苏联青年的榜样，更好地来完成我们今年的开荒任务。五月三日夜间，他们的小组以开荒四点六八公顷（定额三点五公顷）和节约油料九点六六公斤的优异成绩完成了开荒任务。
