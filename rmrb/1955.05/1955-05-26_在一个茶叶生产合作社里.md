　　In a Tea Production Cooperative
　　By Our Correspondent Yu Ming

    During the spring tea picking season, I visited a tea production cooperative in Qimen County, Anhui Province. This cooperative is called "Shuguang" (Dawn), and it is located in Laowuyang Village.

    Before the sky is fully light and the orioles in the mountains have yet to sing, this mountain village becomes active. Smoke curls from every household, and people hurry back and forth by the stream as tea-picking women get up early to fetch water and cook. Soon, carrying bamboo baskets and wearing straw sandals made of bamboo leaves, they gather from all directions, and bursts of laughter break the silence of the mountain valley. At this time, the mountains and fields are full of people, and the tea-picking women happily take up their positions.

    The men in the mountain village who make tea are also working intensely. In a three-story building, people work in an orderly manner as if in a factory. The tea-rolling machines start up, and the tender green buds taken down from upstairs after withering are rolled into strands of fine tea. After several people sift the rolled tea strands carefully through sieves, they are moved upstairs for fermentation. The tea-baking people light the ovens and place the fermented tea strands, basket by basket, onto the ovens to bake... In this way, the famous Qimen black tea is initially produced. The tea farmers sell it to the state, and after processing in a refining factory, it becomes an important material for exchanging for industrial equipment.

    There is a saying in the tea region: "Hemp cannot be completely peeled, tea cannot be completely picked." This means that if the tea gardens are well managed, tea production will continuously increase, and the tea farmers' lives will be good. However, there was also a saying here in the past: "Laowuyang's tea has no good quality, it's either 'hua qing' (mottled green) or 'wu tiao' (black strips)." For decades, the tea farmers of Laowuyang Village suffered the humiliation of being ridiculed and could not change this situation. What could they do? Before liberation, reactionary government officials and tea merchants colluded to exploit their blood and sweat. The tea picked in a year was barely enough to maintain their lives, let alone have the strength to improve tea production.

    After liberation, the state purchased their tea at reasonable prices, enabling them to gradually have the strength to improve tea production. The bad reputation of Laowuyang tea, known for its inferior quality, has finally been changed. Last year, when they were still two mutual aid teams, they learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, picking the large and leaving the small, and picking in batches, and produced the best tea in the whole region. This year, after the establishment of the tea production cooperative, the quality of tea production has become even better. The tea picked in the first ten days or so was all above first-grade tea, and even when the spring tea was about to finish picking, the average price per catty of tea was still more than one yuan and three jiao, which is higher than the quality of ordinary tea.

    Organizing themselves has enabled them to implement various reforms. Labor model Wang Linmao, when working individually, had to hire seven people to help with tea picking during the tea picking season. Last year, the mutual aid team of nine households only needed to hire eight people; after the tea picking season, the mutual aid team also drew people and animal power to help others plant twenty mu of rice. This year, in the cooperative, there are more tea plants, but the number of hired workers during the tea season has not increased. This year, they also plan to help others plant thirty mu of rice. The farmers here rarely reclaimed wasteland in the past, but because they are organized and save labor, they have reclaimed more than forty mu of wasteland in the past two years, and this year they have planted corn. Wang Linmao said excitedly: "Although we are a tea production cooperative, we must also grow more crops and not always rely on the state for supplies. This year, the state still supplies us with several thousand catties of grain, and we must strive not to need state supplies in one or two years."

    The lives of the tea farmers in the mountain village have greatly improved. Every member of the cooperative knows how their good life has come about, and they are all full of love and hope for their cooperative. This spring, everyone used their own wood to build a three-story tea-making room. Now, they have new plans. One clear morning, labor model Wang Linmao led me to the rapids of a small river opposite the mountain village, where he stopped:

    "After we finish picking the spring tea, we will install a water-powered rolling machine here. When we pick the summer tea, we will be able to save more than a dozen laborers compared to using the current hand-cranked rolling machine."

    "This place will all be planted with tea trees, and in a few years we will be able to harvest tea; over there, we will build a withering room, so that the rolling and withering work can be closely coordinated." He pointed to a piece of flat land of more than twenty mu around the rapids of the small river, and the place where the withering room was to be built.

    He led me along the small river to the bank of a large river south of the mountain village, and said: "We planted more than 20,000 fir trees here last winter and this spring, and we will continue to plant a large number of trees every year. We plant crops and plant trees, and when tea production is relatively idle, we have something to do, and we will not be idle all year round."

### 在一个茶叶生产合作社里

　　在一个茶叶生产合作社里
　　本报记者　于明
    在采摘春茶的季节里，我访问了安徽省祁门县的一个茶叶生产合作社。这个社的名字叫“曙光”，它所在的地方叫做老屋杨村。
    天曚曚亮，山里的黄莺还没有叫起来的时候，这个山村里就活跃起来了。家家炊烟缭绕，小溪边有人来往匆匆，采茶的妇女们早起打水做饭了。一会儿，她们背着萝筐，脚上缚着竹叶草鞋，从四面八方聚集起来，一阵欢笑声，打破了山沟里的寂静。这时，满山遍野都是人群，采茶女愉快地踏上自己的岗位。
    山村里制茶的男人们，也在紧张地劳动。在一座三层楼房里，人们像是在工厂里一样有秩序地工作着，揉茶机响动起来，从楼上取下来的经过萎凋的嫩绿幼芽，被揉成一缕缕的青丝。几个人把揉好的茶丝在筛子里细细筛拣以后，就移到楼上发酵了。烘茶的人们燃起了烘炉，把已经发酵的茶丝，一筐筐放在烘炉上烘烤……。就这样，著名的祁门红茶便初制出来了。茶农们把它卖给国家，再经过精制厂加工，它们就变成换取工业设备的重要物资。
    茶区有句俗话说：“剥不尽的麻，摘不尽的茶”。这是说，茶园管理得好，茶叶的生产就会不断提高。茶农的生活会过得很好。可是，这里在过去又有这样一句话：“老屋杨的茶叶没有好货，不是花青就是乌条。”几十年来，老屋杨村的茶农却受着被人嘲讽的屈辱，一直改变不过来。他们有什么办法呢？解放前，反动政府的官僚和茶商结合起来榨取他们的血汗，一年采摘的茶叶，连生活都难维持，哪能有力量改进茶叶生产。
    解放后，国家用合理的茶价收购了他们的茶叶，使得他们逐渐有力量改进了茶叶的生产。老屋杨茶叶低劣的坏名声，也终于改变过来了。去年，当他们还是两个互助组的时候，便学习苏联先进经验，采大留小，分批采摘，就生产出全区最好的茶叶。今年，成立茶叶生产合作社以后，茶叶生产的质量更好了，最初十几天采摘的茶叶都在一级茶以上，直到春茶快要采摘结束时，每斤茶的平均价格仍有一元三角多，比一般的茶叶质量都高。
    组织起来，使他们有条件实行各种改革。劳动模范王林茂，在单干时，他一家在采茶季节中，要雇请七个人帮助采摘。去年九户的互助组却只雇八个人就够了；在采茶季节过后，互助组还抽人、畜力帮助别人种了二十亩水稻。今年，在合作社里，茶棵更多了，可是茶季雇工却没有增加，今年还计划帮助别人种三十亩水稻。这里的农民过去很少开垦荒地，由于组织起来，节省劳动力，他们这两年却开垦了荒地四十多亩，今年都种了玉米。王林茂兴奋地说：“我们虽然是个茶叶生产合作社，可是我们也得多种些庄稼，不能老要国家供应。今年国家还供应我们几千斤粮食，我们要争取在一、二年后不要国家供应。”
    山村里茶农的生活大大改善了，每个社员，都知道美好的生活是怎样得来的，都对自己的合作社充满了热爱和希望。今年春天大家用自己的木头盖起了三层楼的制茶室。现在，他们又有了新的打算。一个晴朗的早晨，劳动模范王林茂带领我走到山村对面一条小河的急流处，在这里他停下来了：
    “这个地方，我们在春茶采过后，就要安水力揉捻机了。到采摘夏茶时，我们就能比用现在的手摇揉捻机节省十几个劳动力。”
    “这里要都种上茶树，几年以后就能收茶叶；那边要建立萎凋室，这样就使揉捻和萎凋的工作就近配合起来。”他指着小河急流四周的一片二十多亩的平地，和准备建立萎凋室的地方说。
    他带我沿着小河走到了山村南边的一条大河的河岸上，他说：“我们去年冬天和今年春天已经在这里栽杉树二万多棵，以后每年还要大量栽树。我们种了庄稼又栽了树，在茶叶生产比较空闲的时候，就有事可做，一年四季都不会闲着了。”
