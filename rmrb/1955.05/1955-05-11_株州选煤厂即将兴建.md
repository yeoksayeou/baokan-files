Zhuzhou Coal Washing Plant to be Built Soon

　　A large-scale, fully automated coal washing plant will be built in Zhuzhou, Hunan this year. After the plant is completed, the coal produced in Doushan, Zixing in Hunan, and Pingxiang in Jiangxi will be refined and supplied to Hubei Steel Company and other units for production and use. At present, the construction preparation work for the first phase of the project is underway. Relevant departments such as the Zhuzhou Municipal People's Government have sent cadres to assist in the process. (Our correspondent in Changsha)
