　　The Tibet Region and Changdu Region now have 27 primary schools with more than 2,000 Tibetan students, nearly double the number in the spring of last year.

　　The number of students at Lhasa Primary School has increased from nearly 300 in 1952 to more than 1,020. The school recently built six spacious classrooms and a slide projector room, and purchased more than 2,000 Tibetan and Chinese books and comic books. Since its establishment more than two years ago, Lhasa Primary School has had more than 300 students who have learned to write compositions and read Tibetan books and newspapers in Tibetan, and more than 60 students have been admitted to the Central and Southwest Nationalities Colleges.

　　The ten primary schools in various Zong and Xi-ka of the Xigaze area have more than 460 students. Primary schools have been established in Angren Zong, located in the area where agriculture and animal husbandry meet in the upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, and in Kangba Zong in the Himalayan mountains. Primary schools in four other Zong and Xi-ka are also being planned.

　　The ten primary schools in the Qamdo area have more than 400 children studying.

　　There are more than 100 teachers in primary schools in various places. More than half of them are local Tibetan intellectuals. They work closely with Han teachers and are familiar with and have mastered teaching skills.

　　The State Council of the People's Republic of China has allocated a total of more than 1.42 million yuan in the past three years to develop primary school education in the Tibet Region and the Changdu Region. In addition to providing students with books and stationery free of charge, the schools also provide scholarships and living expenses to poor students.
