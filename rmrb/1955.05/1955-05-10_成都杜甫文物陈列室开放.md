　　Chengdu Du Fu Relics Exhibition Hall Opens

　　The relics exhibition hall of the great patriotic poet Du Fu officially opened on May 4th in Du Fu Thatched Cottage, outside the west gate of Chengdu. The newly built relics exhibition hall displays a total of more than 440 copies and 3,770 volumes of Du Fu's poetry collections and other related materials collected from all over the country; among them, there are 161 different versions of Du Fu's poems, with more than 1,300 volumes. There are also more than 500 pieces of Du Fu's relics, ancestral halls, inscriptions, photos, rubbings, and cultural relics. Among the relics are more than 20 kinds of Du Fu portraits from the Yuan Dynasty onwards, and materials related to Du Fu's life, such as the Du family genealogy from the poet's hometown—Yaowan Village, Gong County, Henan Province, as well as photos of places where the poet traveled and his tomb. In the exhibition hall, in glass cabinets and on the walls, are stored or hung calligraphy and paintings written by famous ancient and modern Chinese writers, painters, and calligraphers. The old painter Qi Baishi also specially painted four Du Fu poetic paintings for the Thatched Cottage, such as "Sick Orange" and "Withered Palm." On the wall opposite the entrance of the exhibition hall hangs a couplet recently written by Guo Moruo for Du Fu Thatched Cottage: "World of sores, a sage in poetry; People's suffering, waves under the pen."

　　Du Fu Thatched Cottage was a small thatched house built more than 1,190 years ago, in 759 AD, when the poet Du Fu migrated from Shaanxi to Sichuan via Gansu, on the bank of Huanhua Creek, west of Wanli Bridge and north of Baihua Pond in Chengdu, and later built scattered pavilions and terraces. The poet lived in the Thatched Cottage for more than five years, writing many excellent poems such as "The Song of the Thatched Roof Being Torn by the Autumn Wind," "Year's End," "Old Man in the Country," and "Parting Sorrows." Du Fu Thatched Cottage underwent ten renovations from the Tang Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty. In recent years, the People's Government has not only vigorously renovated it but also sorted out a large number of cultural relics. Every year, thousands upon thousands of people come here to visit.

　　成都杜甫文物陈列室开放
    伟大爱国诗人——杜甫的文物陈列室，五月四日在成都西门外杜甫草堂内正式开放。新建的文物陈列室里，陈列着从全国各地搜集来的杜甫的诗集和其他有关资料共有四百四十多部，三千七百七十多册；其中各种不同版本的杜诗就有一百六十一部，一千三百多册。还有杜甫的遗迹、祠宇、碑铭的照片、拓片和文物五百多件。文物中有元代以来的二十多种的杜甫像，和有关杜甫生平的材料，如有来自诗人家乡——河南省巩县瑶湾村的杜家族谱，以及诗人游踪的地方和墓地的照片。陈列室内的玻璃柜和墙壁上，存放着或悬挂着我国古代和近代著名文学家、画家和书法家所写的字和画的画。老画家齐白石还特为草堂画了“病橘”“枯棕”等四幅杜甫诗意画。陈列室内正对面门口的墙壁上，挂着郭沫若最近为杜甫草堂写的“世上疮痍诗中圣哲；民间疾苦笔底波澜”的对联。
    杜甫草堂是一千一百九十余年前，公元七百五十九年，诗人杜甫由陕西经甘肃流徙到四川，在成都万里桥以西和百花潭以北的浣花溪畔，营建起的一座不大的茅屋，和后来建起疏疏落落的亭台。诗人在草堂住了五年多，写有“茅屋为秋风所破歌”、“岁暮”、“野老”、“别恨”等许多优秀的诗篇。杜甫草堂从唐代到清代，先后经过十次整修。近几年来，人民政府除大力培修外，并整理了大批文物。每年都有成千上万的人到这里参观。（本报驻成都记者）
