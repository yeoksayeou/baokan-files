　　Great Achievements in Northwest Railway Construction
　　——On the Northwest New Railway Technology Exhibition
　　By our reporter Kang Weizhong
    The Northwest New Railway Technology Exhibition opened on May 3rd at the Lanzhou Cultural Center. This is a grand review of the achievements in Northwest railway construction over the past two years.

    In the first exhibition room, a three-dimensional map model of the four Northwest provinces is displayed, showcasing the long-term vision of Northwest railway construction. Along the railway lines, there are abundant oil fields, metal mineral resources, livestock products, cash crops, agricultural crops, and other special products, fully illustrating how important building railways in these areas is to the country and the people of the Northwest.

    Currently, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is under intense construction. Another Lanzhou-Baotou Railway, stretching 700 kilometers, has been surveyed to Dijitai, 80 kilometers from Lanzhou. The Qinling project of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is also under intense progress.

    Railways have brought many benefits to the people of the Northwest. Since the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, the volume of freight transported has reached more than 4 million tons, equivalent to 500 trucks running on the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway for fifteen years, 1,000 horse-drawn carts pulling for forty years, or 5,000 camels transporting for eighty years. Over the past two years, 400,000 tons of industrial construction materials such as drilling machines, cranes, generators, large transformers, and heavy-duty trucks have been transported from other regions to the Northwest. The quantity of daily-use industrial products and non-staple foods transported is also considerable. The people of the Northwest have already tasted southern bananas, Guanggan oranges, tangerines, sea fish, and kelp.

    Before 1952, when there was no railway, Gansu Province did not organize the export of local specialties. In the past two years, the province has organized the export of twenty-three types of hemp, angelica, and licorice. Hemp alone could earn the country more than 13,000 tons of steel in 1954. Due to the low railway freight rates, generally seven-eighths of the truck freight rates, the prices of 640 commodities in Lanzhou City have generally decreased by 7.3%. Before 1952, the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway could only transport more than 200,000 passengers annually; in the past two years, trains have transported 2.84 million passengers. All of these have brought unprecedented prosperity to the Northwest.

    In the second exhibition room, the most striking displays are two models of dangerous engineering projects: the route selection project of the Wushaoling Mountain and the large blasting at the Falling Cliff.

    Wushaoling Mountain is over 3,000 meters above sea level. Engineers Zheng Hengxing and Yang Shoupeng utilized collective wisdom to select the most economical and ideal route, saving the country 6.6 million yuan. A year and a half ago, heroic workers, braving blizzards, conquered Wushaoling Mountain, excavated a large tunnel, and opened up a road for trains on the steep mountain pass.

    The models of Gulang Gorge and the Falling Cliff are shocking to see. The height from the road surface to the top of the cliff is as high as 180 meters, with protruding dangerous rocks at the top and cracks more than one meter wide. Every time there is an earthquake, there is a danger of collapse. It seriously threatened the safety of traffic and hindered the westward progress of the train. The heroic railway workers adopted the Soviet method of large-scale blasting to open mountains. From July 29th to September 3rd, 1954, they excavated a guide tunnel 46 meters long that directly hit the "heart" of the Falling Cliff, and loaded it with four and a half tons of yellow explosives. On the afternoon of September 5th, a deafening roar blasted away half of the mountain. According to measurements, this blast removed a total of 38,324 cubic meters of stone, which would require 3,421 freight cars to transport. After this obstacle was removed, the railway continued to extend westward.

    The rolling Yellow River flows and roars day and night. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang and Baotou-Lanzhou Railways need to cross the Yellow River to extend forward. Two giant bridges will be built in this turbulent river. In the third exhibition room, you can see the construction of these two Yellow River bridges. During the construction of these two bridges, most of the work was done using machinery and small machinery. The workers also proposed many technical improvements, including the turntable pile driving rig collectively created by the technical personnel and workers of the Bridge Team of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. It is suitable for the construction of circular steel sheet pile cofferdams, can reduce the time for moving the frame in the old method, and ensures construction quality and safety. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge used this method, which accelerated the progress of the project and saved the country 150,000 yuan. It has now been modified and utilized on the construction site of the Lanzhou-Baotou Railway Yellow River Bridge.

    In the fourth and fifth exhibition rooms, various types of small construction machinery are exhibited. There are bulldozers and trailer cars and power winches, towing trains, and double-track automatic landslide cars that can drive more than 30 cars. These machines have played a significant role in reducing the physical labor of workers and improving work efficiency. The fifth exhibition room also showcases many mechanical maintenance equipment, such as the small preheating boiler created by workers, which overcomes the difficulty of starting mechanical engines in winter and eliminates the phenomenon of damaging machines by baking with fire.

    In the seventh, eighth, and ninth exhibition rooms, the most eye-catching is a complete model of a pier and platform finished product factory and a bridge factory. This is one of the great achievements of our country in learning from the Soviet Union's factory-style construction experience. In the sparsely populated Gobi Desert, a strange, mechanically produced factory appeared: the collected sand and gravel are screened through a conveying cylinder and fed into a concrete mixer. After mixing, it is sent to the finished product factory. After only three days of curing, it can be transported to the construction site by large trucks for pier and platform assembly. This is a major reform that turns the individual production of handicrafts in the field into mechanized specialized production. Especially in the Northwest, in sparsely populated construction sites lacking water and sand, the adoption of this method is of particular significance.

    The materials at the exhibition tell us that in the past two years, 3,675 rationalization proposals made by employees on the new railways in the Northwest have been implemented, saving the country more than 25.8 million yuan. We believe that all employees on the new railways in the Northwest will further develop their wisdom, better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and will surely achieve greater success.

　　西北铁路建设的伟大成就
　　——记西北新建铁路技术展览会
　　本报记者　康伟中
    五月三日，西北新建铁路技术展览会在兰州市文化馆开幕。这是两年来西北铁路建设成就的大检阅。
    第一展览室里，陈列着一幅西北四省的立体地图模型，展示了西北铁路建设的远景。在铁路沿线，遍布丰富的油田、金属矿产、畜产、经济作物、农作物以及其他特产，充分说明了在这些地区修建铁路对国家和西北人民是多么重要。
    目前，兰新铁路正在紧张施工。另一条长达七百公里的兰（州）包（头）铁路，已定测到离兰州八十公里的狄家台。宝成铁路的秦岭工程也正在紧张进行中。
    铁路给西北人民带来了很多好处。天兰路通车后，运送货物已达四百多万吨，相当于五百辆汽车在西（安）兰（州）公路上跑十五年，相当于一千辆马车拉四十年，相当于五千头骆驼运八十年。两年来，从外地运到西北的工业建设器材如钻探机、起重机、发电机、大型变压器和大型载重汽车等达四十万吨。运进的日用工业品和副食品的数量也很可观。西北人民已经吃到了南方的香蕉、广柑、橘子、海鱼和海带等。
    一九五二年没有通车以前，甘肃省的土特产不组织出口。这两年，全省组织出口的大麻、当归、甘草等共有二十三种，仅大麻一项，在一九五四年就可给国家换回一万三千多吨钢材。由于火车运费低廉，一般货物比汽车运费八分之七，使兰州市的六百四十种商品价格普遍降低了百分之七点三。一九五二年以前，西兰公路上每年仅能运送旅客二十多万人次，两年来火车运送的旅客已达二百八十四万人次。这些都使西北出现了从来未有的繁荣。
    在第二展览室里，给人们印象最突出的是两幅险峻的工程模型：乌鞘岭的选线工程和跌落崖大爆破。
    乌鞘岭海拔三千公尺以上，工程师郑恒兴和杨寿彭两同志发挥集体智慧，选出了最经济最理想的路线，为国家节省了六百六十万元。一年半以前，英勇无比的工人，冒着暴风雪，征服了乌鞘岭，开凿出大隧道，在险峻的盘山道上给火车打通了道路。
    古浪峡和跌落崖的模型，使人看了触目惊心。从路面到崖顶高达一百八十公尺，上部危岩突出，裂缝宽有一公尺多。每逢地震，就有塌落的危险。它严重地威胁着行车的安全，阻碍着火车西行的去路。英勇的铁路职工们采用了苏联大爆破开山法，从一九五四年七月二十九日到九月三日，挖成了一条长达四十六公尺的直捣跌落崖“心脏”的炮眼导坑，装进去四公吨半黄色炸药。九月五日下午，一声震天轰鸣，炸掉了半壁山头。经过测量，这一炮炸掉的石头共有三万八千三百二十四公方，要用火车载运，需要三千四百二十一个车皮。这个障碍扫除了之后，铁路又继续向西延伸了。
    滚滚的黄河日夜不停地奔腾咆啸。兰新路、包兰路要跨过黄河向前延修，从这波涛汹涌的河水中要建立起两座巨型的大桥。在第三展览室里，就可以看到这两座黄河大桥的施工情况。这两座大桥在施工过程中，绝大部分都采用了机械和小型机械，职工们还提出了许多技术改进办法。其中有铁道部第一工程局桥梁队的技术人员和工人集体创造的转盘打桩架。它适用于圆型钢板椿围堰的修建，可以减少旧法移动装架的时间，并保证了施工质量和安全。兰新铁路黄河大桥采用这个方法，加速了工程进度，还给国家节省了十五万元。现在它已被改装利用到兰包铁路黄河大桥的工地上。
    第四和第五展览室里，展出了各种各样的小型施工机械。里面有能带动三十多节车的推土机拖拉车和动力绞车、牵引列车、双轨自动滑坡车等。这些机械对减轻职工们体力劳动、提高工作效率都起了很大作用。第五展览室里还展出了许多机械维修装备。如工人创造的小型预热锅炉，克服了冬季发动机械引擎的困难，免除了用火烤损坏机器的现象。
    在七、八、九三个展览室里，最引人注意的是一套完整的墩台成品工厂和桥梁工厂模型。这是我国学习苏联工厂化施工经验的伟大成就之一。在人迹罕到的大戈壁滩上，出现了一座陌生的、用机械生产的工厂：采集好的砂碴，通过输送圆筒过筛，喂到混凝土搅拌机里，搅拌好以后送到成品工厂，只需养生三天，就可用大卡车运送到工地进行墩台的拼装了。这是一个把野外的手工业个体生产，变为机械化专业生产的重大改革。特别是西北，在人烟稀少，缺水、缺砂的施工地段，采用这种方法，更具有特殊重要的意义。
    展览会上的材料告诉我们，两年来在西北各条新建铁路上，职工所提的合理化建议共实现了三千六百七十五件，为国家节省了二千五百八十多万元。我们相信，西北新建铁路线上的全体职工，进一步发挥他们的智慧，更好地学习苏联先进经验，
  一定会获得更大的成就。
