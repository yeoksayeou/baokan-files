Beijing Successfully Trials Production of Refrigerators

    After successfully trial-producing refrigerators, the state-owned Beijing Medical Equipment Factory has begun small-scale production.

    This refrigerator is mainly composed of six parts, including a compressor, controller, and cooler. It can hold 0.252 cubic meters of goods. The machine has a precise structure and is equipped with automatic temperature adjustment equipment, with the lowest temperature adjustable to minus two degrees Celsius.

    In the past, the refrigerators used domestically were all imported. The Beijing Medical Equipment Factory began designing and trial-producing in early 1954, based on the needs of hospitals, scientific research departments, and other units. During the trial production process, the technical personnel overcame difficulties such as simple equipment and insufficient technical strength, and finally achieved success. (Xinhua News Agency)

　  北京试制电冰箱成功
    地方国营北京市医疗器械厂试制电冰箱成功后已开始小批生产。
    这种电冰箱主要是由压缩机、控制器、冷却器等六部分组成。它能容藏零点二五二立方公尺的物品。机器结构精密，有自动调节温度设备，最低温度可调节到摄氏零下二度。
    过去，国内使用的电冰箱都是进口货。北京市医疗器械厂根据医院、科学研究部门等单位的需要，从一九五四年初开始设计、试制。在试制过程中，技术人员克服了设备简陋、技术力量不足的困难，终于获得成功。　（新华社）
