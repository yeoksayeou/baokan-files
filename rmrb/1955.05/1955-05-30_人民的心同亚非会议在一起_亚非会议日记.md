    From Independence Building to Gedung Merdeka

    April 20th, Wednesday

    Bandung's focus shifted today from Independence Building to Gedung Merdeka.

    The plenary session has ended. The three subcommittees – the Political Committee composed of heads of delegations, the Economic Committee which began yesterday, and the Cultural Committee – will convene separately here.

    After yesterday afternoon's meeting, the atmosphere in Bandung is optimistic.

    The speech by the head of the Chinese delegation is almost the headline and central theme of all newspapers and editorials today. People mentioned this speech with praise and hope.

    More than one newspaper emphasized Zhou Enlai's statement that "the Chinese delegation has come to seek unity and not to quarrel." The "Torch" newspaper even pointed out: if the conference proceeds in this spirit, "it can be believed that the Political Subcommittee will certainly have satisfactory results."

    The ever-present crowd still stood in front of Independence Building in the city center, while at the same time, the entrance of Gedung Merdeka in the suburbs was suddenly bustling.

    It is six kilometers from the city center to here, but people began to gather here at dawn. The people are watching the Asian-African Conference with unwavering enthusiasm.

    This white two-story building is at the end of the city. It is surrounded by towering trees and green grass. The meadow behind the house can be connected to the verdant slopes of Mount Tangkuban Perahu. Compared with Independence Building, it provides a quieter and cooler environment.

    Thanks to the efforts of the hosts, the house has been furnished with complete conference rooms. Journalists also have all the conveniences here, and every major news agency has a dedicated office. However, they are worried about how to get news.

    At nine o'clock, the delegates walked into the meeting place one after another, but the reporters had to stand outside the door. The subcommittees are holding closed meetings.

    Bandung was not without other important news this morning. There are still people busy working in the press room.

    Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister and head of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, who had been stranded in Yangon due to illness, arrived today and immediately participated in the meeting of heads of delegations. He also submitted a lengthy written statement to the conference. In the statement, he "congratulated the irresistible rise of hundreds of millions of Asian and African people" and "congratulated the great unity of the Asian and African people." He told everyone that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are "contributing to the struggle for peace and security in Asia, Africa and the world, and for peaceful coexistence and cooperation among countries."

    At 8:30 this morning, students from various schools in Bandung held a chorus at the Deklarasi Square to pay tribute to the Asian-African Conference. More than 10,000 young people, all dressed in snow-white uniforms, lined up in neat squares and sang in unison to Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, the chairman of the Asian-African Conference, and the members of the national delegations.

    This is a touching scene, and reporters have a responsibility to tell people who care about the Asian-African Conference.

    Throughout the morning, reporters crowded at the door of the second conference room where the heads of delegations were meeting, hoping to get something. Looking in through the door that opened from time to time, one could see two rows of curved long tables, with Chairman Ali Sastroamidjojo sitting in the center of the left row, and the heads of delegations of various countries sitting around according to the alphabetical order of the first English letter of their country names.

    The most important of the three committees is meeting here. In addition to economic and cultural cooperation, which already have special committees to discuss, the other three items on the agenda of the Asian-African Conference adopted by the plenary session – human rights and self-determination, the issue of dependent peoples, and the promotion of peace and cooperation – will all be discussed here. The results of the discussions of the Economic and Cultural Committees will also be approved here.

    It was not until long after noon that the morning meeting of the Political Committee ended. The reporters who had been waiting for a long time were not without gain. From the smiling faces of the representatives who came out of the meeting place, they knew that the progress of today's meeting was smooth.

    Not only that, many delegations openly announced the situation of the meeting to the press. Before long, the news spread in the press room: the Political Committee discussed the issue of human rights and self-determination this morning, and after little debate, an agreement was reached: the Asian-African Conference should declare its support for the basic principles of human rights and the principles of self-determination of peoples and nations as set forth in the United Nations Charter.

    The meeting of the Political Committee from 3:30 pm to 7:00 pm was also fruitful. It has reached an agreement on the Palestine issue and has appointed a seven-nation group to formulate a resolution expressing support for the rights of the Arab people in Palestine and calling for a peaceful settlement of the Palestine issue. Many representatives of Arab countries expressed particular satisfaction with the discussion of this issue after the meeting.

    The Economic and Cultural Committees, which started working yesterday, have made even faster progress. The Economic Committee has appointed a seven-nation subcommittee to draft a report on economic cooperation. The Cultural Committee has also appointed a twelve-nation subcommittee to further review the proposals for cultural cooperation put forward by various countries.

    Tonight, the atmosphere in Bandung is as optimistic as it was in the morning. People have reason to hope that the meeting of heads of delegations can proceed smoothly.

    However, people have not failed to notice that there is another side to the matter. Today, the following news came from Washington:

    U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower has submitted a message to Congress requesting an appropriation of $3.53 billion to implement its so-called "Mutual Security Program." Eisenhower openly stated in the message: "The immediate threat to world security and stability is now concentrated in Asia... Now is the time to accelerate the development of the vast arc of free Asian countries extending from Korea and Japan to the Middle East... The United States has the ability and the desire and the concern to take a leading role in providing friendly assistance to free Asia."

    According to a Reuters report from Washington yesterday, Washington does not conceal the fact that the U.S. President chose to submit this message on this day in order to influence the Bandung Conference.

    From afternoon to evening, many American "reporters" ran around with Eisenhower's message to visit delegations from various countries, allegedly to "solicit" their "reactions" to the message.

    Hearing the clanging sound of dollars in Bandung is not an auspicious sign.

    As people look forward to tomorrow, they hold hope, but also vigilance.

　　人民的心同亚非会议在一起
　　——亚非会议日记

      （续昨）
    从独立大厦到红白旗大厦
    四月二十日　星期三
    万隆的视线今天从独立大厦转到了红白旗大厦。
    全体会议已经结束了。三个小组委员会：由代表团团长组成的政治委员会，昨天就已经开始的经济委员会和文化委员会，要分别在这里举行。
    在昨天下午会议以后，万隆的空气是乐观的。
    中国代表团团长的发言几乎是今天一切报纸的头条和社论的中心。人们以赞扬和希望提到这个发言。
    不止一家报纸强调周恩来所说的“中国代表团是来求团结而不是来吵架的”这句话。“火炬报”还特别指出：如果会议本着这样的精神进行，“就可以相信政治小组委员会一定会有令人满意的收获。”
    市中心的独立大厦前面还是站着永远不断的人群，同时，远处在郊区的红白旗大厦门口也突然热闹了起来。
    从市中心到这里要走六公里，但是，晨曦初上，就开始有人在这里聚集了。人民以始终如一的热情注视着亚非会议。
    这座白色的两层大楼是在这个城市的尽头。四围大树参天，碧草如茵，屋后的草地一直可以连到覆舟山浓绿的山坡。同独立大厦对比，它提供了一个更加幽静，更加清凉的环境。
    感谢主人的努力，房子里面已经布置好了一套一套设备完善的会议室。记者们在这里也得到一切便利，每一个主要的通讯社都有专用的办公室。不过，他们却都在担心：如何获得新闻？
    九点钟到了，代表们陆续走进会场，但是记者们只好站在门外。小组委员会开的是秘密会议。
    今天早晨，万隆并不是没有别的重要的消息。记者室里仍然有人在忙着工作。
    因病滞留在仰光的越南民主共和国代表团团长范文同副总理今天到了，而且立即参加了代表团团长会议。他还向大会提出了长篇的书面声明。在声明中，他“祝贺亿万亚非人民不可抗拒的兴起”，
  “祝贺亚非人民的大团结”。他告诉大家越南人民和越南民主共和国政府正在“为争取亚洲、非洲和全世界的和平和安全，为争取各国间的和平共处和合作的斗争作出贡献。”
    今天早晨八点半钟，万隆各学校的学生在德卡勒加广场举行合唱，向亚非会议致敬。一万多个青年人，一律穿着雪白的制服，排成整齐的方阵，向亚非会议的主席沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理和各国代表团的团员们齐声欢唱。
    这是一个感人的场面，记者们有责任把它告诉关心亚非会议的人们。
    整个上午，记者们挤在代表团团长在开会的第二个会议室门口，希望得到一点什么。从不时打开的门口看进去，能够看到里面摆着两排弧形的长桌，主席阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约坐在左排正中，各国代表团长顺着国名第一个英文字母的次序坐在周围。
    在这里开会的是三个委员会里最重要的一个。全体会议所通过的亚非会议的议程，除经济合作和文化合作已有专门委员会去讨论外，其他的三项：人权和自决问题，附属地人民的问题，促进和平和合作的问题都将在这里讨论。就是经济和文化两个委员会讨论的结果也将在这里批准。
    直到中午过了很久，政治委员会的上午的会议才告结束。等候了半天的记者们不算完全没有收获，他们从会场里出来的代表们带着笑容的脸上知道今天会议的进展是顺利的。
    不但如此，许多代表团公开地向报界发表了会议的情况。不多久，消息就在记者室中传开了：政治委员会今天上午讨论了人权和自决问题，而且在经过不多的争论以后已经取得了协议：亚非会议要宣布支持联合国宪章中所提出的人权的基本原则以及人民和民族自决的原则。
    政治委员会从下午三点半钟到七点钟开的会议，也是有结果的。它已经就巴勒斯坦问题达成了协议，并且指定了一个七国小组来制定一项决议，表示支持在巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人民的权利，并且要求实现巴勒斯坦问题的和平解决。许多阿拉伯国家的代表在会后都特别对这个问题的讨论表示满意。
    昨天就开始工作的经济和文化两个委员会进展得还要更快些。经济委员会已经指定了一个七国小组委员会来起草关于经济合作的报告。文化委员会也已经指定了一个十二国小组委员会来进一步审议各国对文化合作提出的建议。
    今天晚上，万隆的空气和早晨一样，是乐观的。人们有理由希望代表团团长会议能顺利开下去。
    不过，人们也并不是没有注意到事情还有另外的一面。今天，从华盛顿发出了这样的消息：
    美国总统艾森豪威尔已经向国会提出了咨文，要求拨款三十五亿三千万美元来执行它所谓“共同安全计划”。艾森豪威尔在咨文中公然说：“对世界安全和稳定的眼前的威胁现在集中在亚洲。……现在是加速发展从韩国和日本延伸到中东的自由亚洲的广大弧形地带各国的时候了……美国有能力而且希望和关心在对自由亚洲进行友好的援助方面起带头作用。”
    据路透社昨天从华盛顿发出的消息说，华盛顿方面并不讳言美国总统之所以选择在这个日子提出这个咨文，是为了要影响万隆会议。
    从下午到晚上，许多美国“记者”拿着艾森豪威尔的咨文跑来跑去访问各国代表团，据说是要“征求”他们对这个咨文的“反应”。
    在万隆听见叮叮噹噹敲美元的声音，这不是吉兆。
    当人们瞻望明天的时候，抱着希望，也抱着警惕。
                              （待续）
