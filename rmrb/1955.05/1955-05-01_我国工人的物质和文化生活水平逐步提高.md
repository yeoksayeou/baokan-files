The material and cultural living standards of Chinese workers are gradually improving
Hai Quan

Before liberation, Chinese workers suffered the cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, with extremely low wages and rapidly rising prices, living in extreme poverty. Workers had no access to education, and illiteracy and semi-illiteracy accounted for 60% to 80% of all workers. After liberation, the political and social status of the Chinese working class has undergone fundamental changes, transforming from an oppressed and exploited class into the leading class of the country. Today, they work to create their own happiness and labor to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people of the whole country. Therefore, workers have a very high level of enthusiasm for production. China rapidly completed its industrial recovery task from 1949 to 1952, with an average annual increase of 36.9% in total industrial output value during the recovery period. During the construction period, the speed of industrial development was naturally lower, but the total industrial output value in 1953 still increased by 33% compared to 1952. It is estimated that the total output value of modern industry in 1954 will be 4.2 times that of 1949. On the basis of production development, the material and cultural lives of workers and staff have also been gradually improved.

In recent years, with the development of production, the actual wage level of workers and staff has been continuously increasing. According to statistics from five central industrial departments, the average wage calculated in monetary terms in 1953 increased by 84% compared to 1950. There was a further increase in 1954. In addition to directly paying workers and staff wages, the state also annually increases expenditures on labor insurance, medical and health care, cultural education, and welfare, expands the number of labor employment, and builds a large number of worker and staff housing. At the same time, due to the long-term stability of prices, this has increased the actual income of workers and staff and improved their material lives.

With the rapid development of production, labor insurance undertakings have also developed. The number of workers and staff covered by labor insurance nationwide was only 600,000 in 1949, 1.4 million in 1950, 2.6 million in 1951, 3.3 million in 1952, 4.83 million in 1953, and reached more than 5.3 million by the end of 1954. According to statistics at the end of 1954, a total of 126 large worker sanatoriums, hot spring sanatoriums, tuberculosis sanatoriums, and recuperation centers have been built nationwide, with more than 13,400 beds. There are also 72 amateur recuperation centers. There are more than 1,400 amateur sanatoriums and recuperation centers at the grassroots level of factories and mines, with a total of more than 35,000 beds. In addition, according to statistics at the end of June 1954, there were more than 1,000 nutrition canteens, 15 homes for the elderly and disabled, and 6 orphanages. From 1951 to 1953, a total of more than 800,000 workers and staff stayed in sanatoriums and recuperation centers. In the regular work of labor insurance, attention has also been paid to the prevention of disease and injury, thus playing a significant role in improving the lives and health of workers and staff.

In order to overcome the difficulties of female workers raising children, factories and mines in various places have continuously increased and expanded factory and mine nurseries. According to incomplete statistics at the end of 1954, there were already 4,003 nurseries in the national trade union system, accommodating more than 127,540 children annually, 2,670 breastfeeding rooms, breastfeeding 37,168 children, and 563 women's health rooms. In addition, simple childcare organizations such as joint nurseries, street childcare stations, workshop kindergartens, children's activity centers, and family mutual aid childcare stations have also been established.

In addition, the state also pays a large amount of funds every year to systematically improve the working conditions of workers and staff. According to incomplete statistics, in 1954 alone, the seven central industrial departments allocated more than 39 million yuan for safety technology and labor protection. Newly built and expanded enterprises not only have highly productive equipment but also meet safety and hygiene requirements. In enterprises, workers can receive work clothes, work shoes, and personal protective equipment free of charge. Workers working at heights and with electricity are provided with safety equipment free of charge. In some work departments that damage workers' health, workers can receive health food free of charge and undergo regular physical examinations.

Before liberation, the working hours of workers were very unreasonable, generally around 12 hours, and some even had to work 16 to 18 hours a day. After liberation, the People's Government stipulated reasonable working hours. The right of workers and staff to rest is also clearly stipulated in the Constitution. Article 92 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "Workers in the People's Republic of China have the right to rest. The State prescribes working hours and vacation systems for workers and staff, and gradually expands the material conditions for workers to rest and recuperate in order to guarantee workers' enjoyment of this right."

The Party and the government also attach great importance to improving the cultural level of workers and staff. By the end of 1954, there were more than 11,000 vocational and spare-time cultural schools, with more than 2.9 million workers and staff participating in learning, and more than 300,000 graduating during the year. Illiteracy has also been greatly reduced over the past year. Units such as the Beijing People's Printing Plant and the Shijingshan Power Plant have basically eliminated illiteracy. Vocational and spare-time secondary education has also made great progress. After improving their cultural level, many workers can read drawings, make plans, and write production diaries, which has laid a solid foundation for them to further study production technology, scientific knowledge, and advanced Soviet experience.

At present, almost all factories, mining areas, docks, and stations along railway lines with more than 100 people have established clubs or small club rooms. By the end of 1954, trade union organizations at all levels above the grassroots level had established a total of 1,261 cultural palaces (clubs), 9,206 clubs established in trade union grassroots organizations, and 2,723 workshop club rooms, totaling more than 16 times the number in 1950. The number of trade union film projection teams has increased from only 150 in 1951 to more than 1,400 now. Among them, 827 teams have 16mm film projectors. In 1954 alone, they screened more than 114,000 films, with an audience of 110 million. Trade union libraries number approximately 15,952, with more than 18.82 million books. There are approximately 8,670 radio stations. The activities of these clubs and film teams have organized workers' proper cultural activities, enriched workers' cultural lives, and especially educated workers with the spirit of communism and raised workers' class consciousness.

Workers' various literary and artistic creation and performance abilities are also developing vigorously. According to statistics in 1954, there were 7,046 amateur theater troupes in grassroots organizations nationwide, with more than 183,600 actors and staff. There were a total of 17,680 music, dance, literature, and art organizations, with more than 199,730 participants. Trade union organizations at all levels above the grassroots level have 24 professional theater troupes and more than 670 amateur theater troupes. The performances of the National Mass Amateur Music and Dance Observation Conference in February this year fully illustrate that the liberated new Chinese workers not only continuously exert creativity in production but also contain infinite wisdom and strength in cultural and artistic activities.

After liberation, workers' sports activities have also developed greatly. According to statistics from only 16 cities such as Beijing, Shenyang, and Shanghai, and the railway system, more than 1,169,000 people regularly participate in sports activities such as radio calisthenics, and more than 34,000 organized basketball, volleyball, and football teams. The number of participants is also increasing year by year. In the railway system, there were only 100,000 people in 1950, 200,000 in 1951, 380,000 in 1953, and 520,000 in 1954, an increase of more than four times in four years. Workers' sports associations have been established in industrial systems such as railways, coal mines, and power industries to specifically lead workers' sports activities. According to incomplete statistics in 1954, 4,709 grassroots organizations held sports meetings in one year, with a total of more than 541,000 athletes participating in the competitions. The widespread development of sports activities has enriched workers' cultural lives, enhanced workers' physical fitness, and reduced absenteeism due to illness. At the same time, the activities have cultivated workers' new sports ethics and strengthened workers' collectivist spirit.

There is no doubt that on the basis of continuous improvement in production, the material and cultural living standards of workers and staff in our country are gradually improving. However, the industrial and agricultural production of our country is still very backward, and the living standards of the people of the whole country and all workers and staff are still relatively low. The workers and staff of the whole country are working hard to continuously improve labor productivity, to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the national plan, to realize the socialist industrialization of the country, and to strive for a happier life.

　　我国工人的物质和文化生活水平逐步提高
　　海泉
    解放前，中国工人受着帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的残酷压迫和剥削，工资极低，物价一日数涨，过着非常穷困的生活。工人没有受教育的机会，文盲和半文盲占全体工人的百分之六十到八十。解放后，中国工人阶级的政治地位和社会地位已经起了根本的变化，从被压迫、被剥削的阶级变成了国家的领导阶级，他们今天是为缔造自己的幸福而做工，是为满足全国人民日益增长的物质和文化的需要而劳动。因此，工人们的生产情绪十分高涨。我国在一九四九年至一九五二年迅速地完成了工业恢复任务，在恢复期间工业总产值平均每年递增百分之三十六点九。在建设期间，工业发展的速度当然要低些，但是一九五三年工业总产值仍然比一九五二年增加了百分之三十三。一九五四年预计现代工业的总产值将等于一九四九年的四点二倍。在生产发展的基础上，职工的物质生活和文化生活也逐步地得到改善。
    几年来，随着生产的发展，职工实际的工资水平不断提高。据中央五个工业部门的统计，一九五三年按货币计算的平均工资比一九五○年增加了百分之八十四。一九五四年又有增加。国家除了直接支付职工工资外，并逐年增加劳动保险、医药卫生、文化教育和福利费的开支，扩大了劳动就业人数，大量地修建职工住宅。同时由于物价的长期稳定，这就提高了职工的实际收入，改善了职工的物质生活。
    随着生产的迅速发展，劳动保险事业也有了发展。全国实行劳动保险的职工人数，在一九四九年仅有六十万人，一九五○年则有一百四十万人，一九五一年则有二百六十万人，一九五二年则有三百三十万人，一九五三年则有四百八十三万人，到一九五四年底，已达五百三十余万人。根据一九五四年底的统计，全国已建成较大的工人疗养院、温泉疗养院、结核病疗养院、休养所共一百二十六处，计有一万三千四百余个床位。另有业余休养所七十二处。各厂矿企业基层的业余疗养所和疗养所共一千四百余处，共三万五千余个床位。此外，据一九五四年六月底的统计，还有营养食堂一千余处，养老、残废院十五所，孤儿保育院六所。住过疗养院、休养所的职工，一九五一年到一九五三年共约八十余万人。在劳动保险的经常工作中，又注意了预防病、伤，因而在改善职工生活和增进职工健康方面，起了重大的作用。
    为了克服女工抚养孩子的困难，各地厂矿又不断地增加和扩大厂矿企业托儿所。据一九五四年底不完全的统计，全国工会系统的托儿所已有四千零                  三处，一年中受托儿童达十二万七千五百四十余人，哺乳室二千六百七十个，哺乳儿童三万七千一百六十八人，妇女卫生室五百六十三个。此外还举办了联合托儿所、街道托儿站、工房幼儿园、儿童生活乐园、家属互助托儿站等简便的托儿组织。
    此外，国家每年还支付大量的资金来有计划地改善职工的劳动条件，据不完全的统计，一九五四年仅中央七个工业部门即拨出安全技术劳动保护经费三千九百多万元。新建和扩建的企业，不仅有高度生产效能的设备，而且都符合于安全卫生方面的要求。在企业中，工人可以免费得到工作服、工作鞋和个人防护用具。高空与带电工作的工人，都免费发给安全用具。在一些损害工人健康的工作部门中，工人可以免费得到保健食品，并定期为这些工人进行身体检查。
      解放前，工人的工作时间是很不合理的，一般都在十二小时左右，有的甚至一天要工作十六到十八小时。解放以后，人民政府规定了合理的工作时间。职工的休息权利在宪法上也有明文规定。中华人民共和国宪法第九十二条规定：“中华人民共和国劳动者有休息的权利。国家规定工人和职员的工作时间和休假制度，逐步扩充劳动者休息和休养的物质条件，以保证劳动者享受这种权利。”
    党和政府对提高职工文化水平的工作也是非常重视，到一九五四年底，职工业余文化学校有一万一千多所，参加学习的职工有二百九十余万人，年中毕业的有三十万余人。一年来，文盲也大大减少了。像北京人民印刷厂、石景山发电厂等单位，已基本上没有文盲了。职工业余中等教育也有很大的发展。很多工人在提高文化水平以后，就能看图纸、订计划、写生产日记，这就给他们进一步学习生产技术、科学知识和苏联先进经验打下了稳固的基础。
      现在全国百人以上的工厂、矿区、码头和铁路沿线的各站段，差不多都建立了俱乐部或小型俱乐室。到一九五四年底，基层以上各级工会组织举办的文化宫（俱乐部）共一千二百六十一个，工会基层组织中设立的俱乐部有九千二百零六个，车间俱乐室二千七百二十三个，总计约比一九五○年增加了十六倍以上。工会电影放映队在一九五一年只有一百五十队，现在已增加到一千四百多队。其中有八百二十七队有十六粍的电影放映机。他们在一九五四年一年中，就放映了电影十一万四千多场，观众有一亿一千万人次。工会的图书馆约有一万五千九百五十二个，藏书在一千八百八十二万册以上。广播站约有八千六百七十个。这些俱乐部和电影队的活动，组织了职工的正当文化活动，充实了职工文化生活，特别是用共产主义的精神教育了职工，提高了职工的阶级觉悟。
   工人的各种文艺创作和表演能力也在蓬勃地发展着。据一九五四年的统计，在全国各基层组织中，有业余剧团七千零四十六个，有演员及工作人员十八万三千六百余人。音乐、舞蹈、文艺、美术组织共一万七千六百八十余组，参加人员有十九万九千七百三十余人。基层以上的各级工会组织有专业剧团二十四个，业余剧团六百七十余个。今年二月间全国群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩大会的演出，充分地说明了：解放了的新中国职工，不但在生产上不断发挥着创造性，而且在文化艺术活动方面，也蕴藏着无限的智慧和力量。
      解放后职工体育活动也有很大的发展。仅据北京、沈阳、上海等十六个城市和铁路系统的统计，经常参加体育活动、像广播体操等项目的就有一百十六万九千多人，已经组织起来的篮、排、足球队就有三万四千多队。参加活动的人数也在年年增加着。在铁路系统，一九五○年只有十万人，一九五一年就有二十万人，一九五三年就有三十八万人，到一九五四年就有五十二万人，四年内共发展了四倍以上。在铁路、煤矿、电业等产业系统，都建立了专门领导职工体育活动的职工体育协会。据一九五四年不完全的统计，一年中有四千七百零九个基层组织举行了运动会，参加比赛的运动员共计有五十四万一千余人。体育运动的广泛开展，丰富了职工的文化生活，增强了职工的体质，减少了因病缺勤的现象。同时，在活动中，培养了职工的新体育道德，加强了职工的集体主义精神。
    毫无疑问，在生产不断提高的基础上，我国职工的物质生活和文化生活水平也在逐步提高。但是，我国的工农业生产还是很落后的，全国劳动人民和全国职工的生活水平都还是较低的。全国职工正在为不断地提高劳动生产率，为全面完成和超额完成国家计划，为实现国家的社会主义工业化，为争取更幸福的生活而努力。
