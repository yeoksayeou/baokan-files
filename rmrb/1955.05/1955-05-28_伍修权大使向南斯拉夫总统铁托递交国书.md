Present at the ceremony were Yugoslav Federal Secretary of Foreign Affairs Popovic, Secretary-General of the President's Office Wilfan, and Director of the Protocol Department Dr. Smudlaka.
　　Ambassador Wu Xiuquan delivered a eulogy to President Tito when presenting his credentials, and President Tito delivered a reply.
　　In his eulogy, Ambassador Wu Xiuquan first expressed the respect of the Chairman of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people to President Tito and the Yugoslav people. Ambassador Wu Xiuquan said: The Yugoslav people have a heroic history of struggle, and waged a heroic and unyielding struggle against the war of aggression launched by German fascist militarism. The Yugoslav people, who fought for the independence and freedom of their motherland, are peace-loving, and their efforts in this regard contribute to the promotion of peace in Europe and the world. Ambassador Wu Xiuquan also said that based on the common desire of the people of our two countries to enhance friendship, our two countries have established diplomatic relations, which provides good conditions for promoting friendship between the people of the two countries and developing economic and cultural ties with each other. I believe that this not only conforms to the interests of the Chinese and Yugoslav peoples, but also helps to safeguard the cause of world peace.
　　In his reply, President Tito said: I am very pleased to accept the credentials from the leadership of the People's Republic of China appointing you as representative to our country. I am deeply convinced that your mission to our country will be of great significance for the development and consolidation of relations between the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and the People's Republic of China, and at the same time, I believe that this is also of great significance for our common cause of consolidating peace and international cooperation.
