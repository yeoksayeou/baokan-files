A "Free-Mining" "Open-Pit Coal Mine"
　　Wang Dewen Shi Guanglai
    Next to the gangue yard outside the south gate of the Tangjiazhuang Mine in the eastern mining area of Tangshan City, there has appeared an "open-pit coal mine" with a daily output of over one hundred tons. This "mine" was originally "freely mined" by some poor people on the streets. By September 1954, the district people's committee organized them into two large teams and one large group, with a total of more than 540 people "participating in production." Recently, an internal adjustment was made, probably to facilitate "unified leadership." The two large teams and one large group were merged into one large team, under which various "production" groups were established, as well as a finance department and an accounting department. The "mined" coal is sold to the outside world through the local coal construction company. This "mine" is doing quite well. In less than half a year, its fixed assets include: seventeen coal washing pools, five rubber-wheeled carts, four mules, and some simple houses; in addition, there are unloading, screening, washing, and transporting equipment, as well as protective equipment. The monthly wage expenditure is more than 15,000 yuan, and there are some deposits in the bank.

    Entering this new "mining area," the first thing you encounter is several coal piles like small mountains. Among them, there are more than 3,000 tons of fine coal, and the pile of washed coal is even larger than the pile of fine coal. There are also some small piles, which contain iron sulfide, wood, steel bricks, etc. Although these are by-products, the income is not small. Take iron sulfide, for example, which sells for more than ten yuan per ton. Users who have burned the coal from this "mine," especially users of washed coal, say: it is much better than the No. 2 slack coal from the Tangjiazhuang Mine.

    Every day, brand new rubber-wheeled carts constantly transport the fine coal, washed coal, lump coal… produced here, and the scene is even more lively with the addition of horse-drawn carts hired by some users to transport the coal themselves! People say: the "open-pit mine" is even more bustling than the old mine (referring to the Tangjiazhuang Mine).

    So, how was this "open-pit coal mine" formed? It turned out to be formed by the "gangue" from the Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Mine being dumped here. Since it is "gangue," why is there so much coal? An old man in his fifties said it well: "Kailuan Mine is big, this little bit is nothing." Then he added: "Just this little bit of ‘gangue’ that is dumped out can support this big group of people!"

    The reason why such a large amount of coal flows out of the Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Mine is because: the thin coal seams in this mine are increasing, and the operating methods of separate mining and separate transportation are not strictly implemented; in addition, the workers guarding the coal chutes lack a strong sense of responsibility, and often transport coal out as gangue; another reason is a simple task-oriented view, only focusing on tunneling footage, and blasting the coal and gangue mixed together in one cut, and without properly separating the coal and gangue, they are pulled out and discarded.

    So, since this "open-pit coal mine" is outside the south gate of the Tangjiazhuang Mine, why was it not discovered and solved earlier? There are two reasons: one is that the leadership of the Tangjiazhuang Mine has bureaucracy and does not cherish national resources; the other is that the Tangshan Municipal leadership consciously used this "mine" to carry out relief work. Before liberation, some poor people in Tangshan City relied on picking coal from the gangue to make a living. Because they were unorganized, they often fought. After liberation, it was still the same. Therefore, the district people's committee wanted to organize them, which is of course good; but the problem is that when it was discovered that the gangue contained a lot of coal and that 500 people relied on this "gangue" to make a living, they did not actively make suggestions to the coal mine. On the contrary, they organized the "mining" work even better.

    Some time ago, the Tangjiazhuang Mine was already trying to solve this problem, and issued an instruction on April 12, which stated: "First of all, we must conduct constant education among all employees on cherishing national resources, simplifying, economizing, and not wasting a single plant or tree… Wasting coal is a shameful act." It also proposed to criticize the simple task-oriented view, strictly implement the operating methods of separate mining and separate transportation, and strictly prohibit the mixing of gangue and coal. However, after this instruction was issued, until late April, the mine still threw coal and gangue together, and the "open-pit coal mine" was still so lively.

    What is even more serious is that not only the Tangjiazhuang Mine has this phenomenon, but other mines in Kailuan also have similar situations. For example, the Kailuan Linxi Coal Washing Plant lost a large amount of fine coal the year before last, and this year in February and March, the dry fine coal was blown all over the sky by the wind, wasting more than 1,000 tons of coal. Now, the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration is absolutely necessary to take effective measures to correct this phenomenon, and the municipal leadership should also take the most active measures to solve the livelihood problems of the poor, in order to reduce the open-pit "mine" to the smallest possible scale or close it down.

### 一个“自由开采”的“露天煤矿”

　　一个“自由开采”的“露天煤矿”
　　汪德文　史广来
    在唐山市东矿区、开滦唐家庄矿南门外的矸子场旁边，出现了一个日产量在一百吨以上的“露天煤矿”。这个“矿”原来是由街道上一些贫苦的群众“自由开采”的。到一九五四年九月，区人民委员会把他们组织起来，分两个大队和一个大组，共有五百四十多个人“参加生产”。最近，内部进行了一番调整，大概是为了便于“统一领导”罢，将两个大队一个大组，合并为一个大队，下设各种
  “生产”组，另设财务处和会计处等。“采”出的煤通过当地煤建公司向外推销。这个“矿”经营得并不坏，不到半年的时间，在固定资金方面有：十七个洗煤池、五辆胶皮大车、四头骡子，并有一些简单的房屋；另外还有卸煤、筛煤、洗煤、运煤等生产工具和护体设备；每月支出的工资约在一万五千元以上，在银行里还有部分存款。
    走进这个新的“矿区”，首先接触到的是几座像小山似的煤堆。其中烟子煤堆有三千多吨，洗煤的堆比烟煤堆还要大些。另外还有一些小堆，堆中有硫化铁、木头、钢砖等。这虽是副产品，但收入并不算少。就拿硫化铁来说，每吨就是十几元。烧过这个“矿”的煤的用户，特别是洗煤的用户说：这比唐家庄矿的二号末煤要好得多。
    每天，崭新的胶皮车，来回不断地将这里所产的烟煤，洗煤、块煤……向外发运，再加上一些用户自己雇来运煤的马车，就更加热闹了！人们说：
  “露天矿”比老矿（指唐家庄矿）还热闹。
    那么，这个“露天煤矿”到底是怎样形成的呢？原来它是由开滦唐家庄矿拉出来的“矸子”倒在这里形成的。既然是“矸子”，为什么会有这样多的煤呢？一位五十多岁的老大爷说得好：“开滦矿大，这一点算不了啥。”接着他又说：“倒出这点‘矸子’来，就能养活这一大帮人！”
    开滦唐家庄矿流出这样大量的煤，是因为：这矿薄煤层增多，对掘进分采分运的操作方法执行得不严格；另外就是溜煤眼看守工人的责任心不强，经常以煤当矸子运出去；还有一个就是单纯的任务观点，只顾掘进进尺，一次掏槽将煤和矸子混合崩出，煤和矸子混合不清，便拉出去丢了。
    那么，这个“露天煤矿”既然是在唐家庄矿南门外，为什么不能及早发现，设法解决呢？这有两个原因：一个是唐家庄矿领导上存在官僚主义、不爱惜国家资源；另一个是唐山市政领导机关有意识利用这个“矿”进行救济工作。解放以前，唐山市就有一部分贫民依靠拣矸子里的煤生活，因为无组织，时常打架，解放以后还是如此。于是，区人民委员会便想把他们组织起来，这当然是好的；但问题在于当发现矸子里带煤的现象很严重、有五百人依靠这种“矸子”过活时，并未积极向煤矿提出意见，相反地却把“开矿”的工作组织得更好了。
    前些时，唐家庄矿已经在设法解决这一问题，并于四月十二日发出指示，指示中说：“首先在全体职工中进行经常不断的爱护国家资源，精简节约、不浪费一草一木的教育……浪费煤炭是可耻的行为。”并提出批判单纯任务观点，严格执行分采分运的操作方法，严禁矸子和煤混合的情况。但这个指示发出后，直到四月下旬，矿里仍把煤和矸子掺在一起扔掉，“露天煤矿”还是那样热闹。
    更严重的是不仅唐家庄矿有这样现象，开滦其它矿也有类似的情况。像开滦林西洗煤厂前年大量跑烟子，今年二三月干烟子被风刮得满天飞就浪费了一千多吨煤。现在，开滦煤矿总管理处完全有必要采取有效的措施纠正这种现象了，而市政领导机关也应采取最积极的办法解决贫民的生计问题，以求把露天“矿”缩到最小的规模或者封闭。
