　　In recent years, China's machinery manufacturing industry has developed greatly. The total output value of the national machinery manufacturing industry in 1954 increased by about thirteen times compared with 1949, and the proportion it occupies in the total industrial output value has also greatly increased. China's machinery manufacturing industry has gradually changed from its past extremely backward state and has begun to manufacture several thousand different types of mechanical equipment, ensuring part of the needs of national construction. This is a huge step forward. However, the current situation of China's machinery manufacturing industry is that, on the one hand, it cannot meet the needs of national construction, and on the other hand, its potential strength cannot be fully utilized. This must be actively and gradually changed.
　　The main reasons for the current contradictory situation are the backward technical level and the low organizational level of China's machinery manufacturing industry. Due to the backward technical level, some products, such as automobiles, tractors, large generators, and steel rolling equipment, cannot be manufactured yet. Some products, such as general complete or supporting industrial and mining machinery, can be manufactured with existing equipment, but there are no drawings or other technical data, and there is a lack of product design capabilities and formal manufacturing experience, so they cannot be produced in complete sets. Some products, such as higher-grade metal cutting machine tools and electrical equipment, have drawings and other technical data, but because of low technical capabilities and insufficient technical management, the quality of the manufactured products is very poor. The low organizational level is mainly manifested in the low level of variety planning and insufficient production collaboration, in addition to the weak organizational work within enterprises. Irrational phenomena such as "product duplication," "product relocation," and "product travel" constantly appear between various production factories; reasonable utilization of equipment conditions, technical conditions, and manufacturing experience is not possible, often forming individual efforts, resulting in manufacturing difficulties and wasting technical strength. Many machinery factories often compete to produce familiar old varieties and are unwilling to or dare not produce new varieties that have not been made before, resulting in overproduction and underutilization of old varieties, leading to stockpiles; there is a need for new varieties, but no one makes them, so they cannot meet the needs. Therefore, improving technical level and strengthening organizational work have become important tasks for China's machinery manufacturing industry today.
　　An important way to improve the technical level of the machinery manufacturing industry is to actively increase new product varieties. Only by rapidly and continuously increasing new varieties can we supply more new machinery to newly built enterprises and better play a role in the technological transformation of the national economy. Only through the trial production and production of new products can we better exercise the technical capabilities of the machinery industry, improve the level of technical management, and thus comprehensively enhance technical strength.
　　Under the current conditions, to improve technology and increase new varieties, we must start from two aspects: on the one hand, we must build new factories, renovate existing factories, and equip these factories with modern technology; on the other hand, we must make full use of existing factories, enhance product design capabilities, learn from the advanced technology of the Soviet Union, summarize our successful experiences, adopt advanced operating methods, and continuously improve the level of manufacturing technology, increase new varieties, and improve product quality. Without building new factories, we cannot manufacture important products such as automobiles, tractors, and steel rolling equipment. Therefore, during the first five-year plan period, we will concentrate our efforts on building a number of modern new factories. However, we must never neglect the importance of exploring the potential of existing factories and ignore the significant role of existing factories in meeting the needs of national construction. In the foreseeable future, especially during the first five-year plan period, existing factories are still the main force for increasing new varieties. Those who believe that increasing varieties requires investment in renovating old factories or building new factories, while ignoring the utilization of existing factories or unwilling to carry out inter-factory production collaboration, are incorrect and must be corrected.
　　In the past, our main shortcomings in increasing new varieties were: the lack of an overall long-term plan, which often made it impossible to find the direction for the design and trial production of new products, or repeated trial production, wasting technical strength. The trial production work of some factories often becomes laissez-faire, dragging on and on, or neglecting the main ones and completing the secondary ones. Therefore, first of all, we should formulate a long-term new product production plan, summarize the patterns of various equipment needed for national construction, especially the 156 important construction projects, and select those varieties that are needed more or are needed for a long time and can be produced domestically through efforts, and include them in the annual or five-year new product production plan, and organize relevant personnel, especially design and trial production engineers and technicians, to complete and strive to overfulfill this plan with a creative spirit and the greatest perseverance. Secondly, a strict system of inspection at each level should be established, and the quality of the completion of the new product plan should be taken as one of the important indicators for assessing whether an enterprise has completed the national plan. The management departments of mechanical manufacturing industries at all levels should strengthen the leadership of new product production, help the undertaking factories solve various difficulties, and give appropriate rewards to those factories that have achieved success in completing the new product plan.
　　In order to strengthen organizational work, one of the main links at present is to further properly divide the production scope of each factory according to the principle of overall planning and comprehensive arrangements, based on needs and classified by product system, so that they can all play their due role. In recent years, we have done a lot of work in this area and have gained certain results. However, the shortcomings in the past were the lack of planned comprehensive arrangements for local state-owned general small factories and private factories; when arranging state-owned factories, it was not enough to take into account all types of factories in the country. Although some arrangements have been made for central state-owned factories and some local state-owned factories, there are still shortcomings, resulting in unreasonable phenomena such as "not eating enough" on the one hand and blindly expanding on the other, idle equipment that cannot be used on the one hand and unnecessary equipment being added on the other, very low labor productivity on the one hand and increasing workers on the other, and some products that have already been stockpiled on the one hand and processing orders on the other.
　　In order to further arrange the national machinery manufacturing industry, it is necessary to clearly define the boundaries between machinery manufacturing factories and repair and fitting factories; establish a division of labor in planned management, processing orders, and business management according to the variety series of products, based on different characteristics and requirements, thereby determining the methods for applying for distribution, ordering, manufacturing, and supplying mechanical products; and actively ascertain and propose the required quantity of various equipment.
　　Strengthening inter-factory production collaboration has particularly significant significance. Because there are many varieties and specifications of mechanical products, and manufacturing factories have different sizes, in order to concentrate efforts to ensure the needs of national construction, it is necessary to establish inter-factory cooperative relationships. Inter-factory cooperative relationships can be roughly divided into the following types: one is "supporting collaboration," in order to supply complete sets of equipment, the machinery manufacturing industry should take a certain factory as the main body and organize other related factories to cooperate with it to complete the complete set of equipment. For example, complete sets of power generation equipment are like this. Another is "assembly collaboration," in order to complete the manufacture of a complex machine, it is often necessary to organize many other factories to serve a main factory. For example, automobile factories and shipyards are like this. Another is "processing collaboration," which is the mutual assistance between factories in the general production and processing process. For example, heavy machinery manufacturing plants supply general machinery plants with large castings, forgings, or processing large machine parts, and require general machinery plants to supply them with general parts, and so on. There is also a repair and fitting cooperative. Through these, using large factories to drive small factories, central state-owned factories to drive local state-owned factories, and state-owned factories to drive private factories to establish cooperative relationships, and gradually fix this cooperative relationship with contact contracts. Only in this way can we avoid or reduce the phenomenon of blind investment and renovation and construction of unnecessary factories and other wasteful phenomena, can we rapidly improve technically, and can we better organize the machinery manufacturing industry comprehensively through planning.

### 努力提高机械制造业的水平

　　努力提高机械制造业的水平
    几年来，我国机械制造业有很大发展。全国机械制造工业的总产值一九五四年比一九四九年增加了约十三倍，在全部工业总产值中所占的比重也有很大提高。我国机械制造工业已经逐步改变了过去极端落后的状态，开始能够自己制造了几千种不同类型的机械设备，保证了国家建设的部分需要。这是一个巨大的进步。但是我国机械制造工业目前的状况是一方面还不能满足国家建设的需要，另一方面潜在力量又不能充分发挥。这是必须积极地逐步地加以改变的。
    产生目前的矛盾状况的主要原因是我国机械制造工业的技术水平落后和组织水平不高。由于技术水平落后，目前有一些产品，例如汽车、拖拉机、大型发电机和轧钢设备还不能制造；有的产品，如一般的成套或配套工矿机械，利用现有设备是可以制造的，但又没有图纸等技术资料，缺乏产品设计能力和正规的制造经验，也还不能成套地生产；有些产品，如较高级的金属切削机床和电器设备等，虽已有图纸等技术资料，但因为技术能力低和技术管理水平不够，制造出来的产品质量很差。组织水平不高，除了表现在企业内部的组织工作薄弱以外，主要表现在品种计划水平低和生产协作不够。各个生产工厂之间不断地出现“产品重复”、“产品搬家”、“产品旅行”等不合理的现象；不能合理地利用设备条件、技术条件和制造经验，往往形成单干，结果既造成制造上的困难，也浪费了技术力量。许多机械厂往往争着做共同做熟了的老品种，不愿做或不敢做没有做过的新品种，以致老的品种产得多、用得少，形成积压；新的品种有需要、没人做，不能满足需要。因此，提高技术水平和加强组织工作，就成为我国机械制造工业当前的重要任务。
    提高机械制造工业技术水平的重要途径，就是要积极增加新的产品品种。只有迅速不断地增加新的品种，才能给国家新建企业输送更多的新的机械，才能在国民经济技术改造过程中更好地发挥作用。只有通过新产品的试制和生产才能更好地锻炼机械工业的技术能力，提高技术管理水平，从而全面地增强技术力量。
    在目前的条件下，要提高技术，增加新的品种，必须从两方面着手：一方面要建设新工厂，改建现有工厂，并用近代化的技术装备这些工厂；另一方面要充分利用现有工厂，增强产品设计能力，学习苏联的先进技术，总结自己的成功经验，采用先进的操作方法，不断地提高制造技术的水平，增加新的品种和提高产品质量。不建设新的工厂，我们就不可能制造汽车、拖拉机、轧钢设备等重要产品。因此，在第一个五年计划期内，我们将集中力量建设一批近代化的新厂。但是我们绝不能因此忽视发掘现有工厂潜力的重要性，忽略现有工厂在解决国家建设需要方面的重大作用。在今后相当长的时期内，特别是在第一个五年计划期内，现有工厂仍是增加新品种的主要力量。那些认为要增加品种就要投资改建旧厂或建设新厂，而忽视利用现有工厂或不愿进行厂际生产协作的看法和做法都是不对的，必须注意纠正。
    过去我们在增加新品种方面的主要缺点是：缺乏通盘的较长远的计划，因而往往找不到新产品的设计和试制的方向，或者重复试制，浪费了技术力量。有些工厂的试制工作往往形成自流，一拖再拖，或是放松了主要的而完成了次要的。因此，今后首先应编制长远的新产品生产计划，总结国家建设特别是一百五十六个重要建设项目所需要的各种设备的规律，从中选出那些需要较多或是长期需要而国内经过努力可能生产的品种，列入年度的或五年的新产品生产计划中，并组织有关人员特别是设计和试制的工程技术人员，以创造性的精神和最大的毅力来完成和争取超额完成这一计划。其次，应建立严格的逐级检查制度，把新产品计划完成的好坏作为考核一个企业是否完成国家计划的重要标志之一。各级机械制造工业的管理部门应加强对新产品生产的领导，帮助承制工厂解决各种困难，对那些完成新产品计划有成绩的工厂应给以适当奖励。
    为了加强组织工作，当前的主要环节之一，是根据统筹兼顾，全面安排的方针，根据需要，按产品系统分门别类地对每个工厂的生产范围进一步妥善地划分，使它们都能发挥其应有的作用。几年来，我们在这方面曾做了不少的工作，并有一定的收获。但过去的缺点是对地方国营的一般小厂和私营工厂缺少有计划地进行全面安排；在安排国营工厂的时候，全面照顾全国各种经济类型工厂也是不够的。对于中央国营工厂和某些地方国营工厂虽作了一些安排，但也还有缺点，以致发生了一方面“吃不饱”、另一方面还在盲目扩建，一方面设备闲置不能发挥、另一方面还在增添不必要的设备，一方面劳动生产率很低、另一方面还在增加工人，一方面有些产品已经积压、另一方面还在加工订货等等不合理的现象。
    为了进一步对全国机械制造工业进行安排，必须明确划定机械制造工厂和修配工厂的界限；按产品的品种系列，根据不同的特点和要求，建立计划管理、加工订货和经营管理的分工，从而确定机械产品申请分配、订货、制造和供应的办法；并积极摸清和提出各种设备需要量。
    加强厂际间的生产协作具有特殊重大的意义。因为机械产品的品种规格繁多，而制造工厂又有大小规模的不同，为了集中力量保证国家建设的需要，就必须建立厂际间的协作关系。厂际间的协作关系大致可以分为以下几种：一种是“配套协作”，为了供应成套设备，机械制造工业应以某一工厂为主体，组织其他有关工厂同它配合，协作完成成套的设备。例如成套发电设备就是这样。另一种是“总装协作”，为了完成一种复杂机器的制造，往往需要组织很多其他工厂为一个主要工厂服务。例如汽车厂和造船厂就是这样。又一种是“加工协作”，也就是厂和厂之间在一般生产加工过程中的相互帮助。例如重型机器制造厂供应一般机器厂以大型铸件、锻件或加工大型机件，以及要求一般机器厂供应它一般部件等等。还有一种是修配性的协作。通过这些，用大厂带动小厂，中央国营工厂带动地方国营工厂，国营工厂带动私营工厂的办法来建立协作关系，并逐步用联系合同把这种协作关系固定下来。只有这样，我们才可以避免或减少盲目投资以及改建和新建不必要的工厂等浪费资金的现象，才能在技术上迅速提高，才能更好地通过计划把机械制造业全面地组织起来。
