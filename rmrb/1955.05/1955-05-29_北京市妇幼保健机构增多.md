The number of maternal and child health institutions in Beijing is steadily increasing. Currently, the city has three maternal and child health experimental institutes and maternity hospitals. The suburban districts have maternal and child health clinics and maternal and child health groups in health clinics, with over 1,000 trained midwives. In addition, there are four children's hospitals, children's clinics, and children's health centers in the city. Each municipal general hospital also has obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics departments.

These maternal and child health institutions conduct prenatal examinations and postpartum visits for pregnant women and new mothers, greatly reducing the mortality rate of mothers and infants. According to statistics from the urban area, the infant mortality rate in 1954 decreased by two-thirds compared to 1949. The neonatal tetanus mortality rate also decreased by 93% compared to 1949. The number of babies delivered using modern methods has reached 98% of all births in the city. From January to May 20, 1955, the No. 2 Maternal and Child Health Station in Qianmen District delivered a total of 581 babies, with both mothers and children doing well. The maternal and child health clinics and groups in each district also assist the nurseries and daycare centers in the entire district in conducting health work for children and childcare workers. Many maternal and child health organizations also assist factories in reorganizing nurseries and infant rooms, reducing absenteeism among female workers and improving the health of children.

　　北京市妇幼保健机构增多
    北京市的妇幼保健机构正日渐增多。现在，全市已有三所妇幼保健实验院和产院。市郊各区都设有妇幼保健所和卫生所的妇幼保健组，其中有一千多名经过训练的接生员。此外，全市还有儿童医院、儿童门诊部和儿童保健所等四所。各市立综合性医院也设有妇产科和小儿科。
    这些妇幼保健机构对孕妇、产妇进行了产前检查和产后访视，使产妇和婴儿的死亡率大大降低。据城区统计一九五四年婴儿的死亡率比一九四九年降低三分之二。新生婴儿破伤风死亡率也比一九四九年降低了百分之九十三。新法接生的婴儿已达全市婴儿出生数的百分之九十八。前门区第二妇幼保健站从一九五五年一月到五月二十日，共接生了五百八十一个婴儿，母子都很平安。各区妇幼保健所和妇幼保健组还协助全区的托儿所、托儿站对儿童和保育人员进行保健工作。许多妇幼保健机关还协助工厂整顿了托儿所和乳儿室，减少了女工的缺勤，使儿童的健康情况也有了改善。（新华社）
