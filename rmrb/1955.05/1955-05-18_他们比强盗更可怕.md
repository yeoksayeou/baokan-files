　  They are More Terrible Than Robbers
    Ling Han

    Reading Shu Wu’s exposé of "Some Materials Regarding the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" filled me with utter shock and indignation! Although I am a student in the Hydraulic Engineering Department of Tsinghua University, I have been paying attention to Hu Feng’s anti-Party literary and artistic thought. For more than a decade, under the guise of Marxist-Leninist terminology, Hu Feng has been frantically opposing the Party and the literary and artistic movement led by the Party, determined to "coexist with the position to the death." If Hu Feng had openly confessed his reactionary stance and his reactionary literary and artistic thought, people would have easily seen the true face of the Hu Feng clique and swept them away long ago. But a swindler is more terrible than a robber precisely because a swindler lacks even the sincerity of a robber. For more than a decade, Hu Feng has been playing the role of a swindler, lacking even a shred of honest sincerity. He disguised himself as a left-wing literary theorist, concealing his ugly face; he swaggered about, established his own banner, and gathered followers to attack the people's literary and artistic cause and progressive writers. Hu Feng has mastered the tricks of a swindler to the extreme; indeed, he is a cunning and excellent henchman of the reactionary forces.

    Before this, we regarded his set of tricks to change the concept of things: replacing the world outlook of the working class with "subjective fighting spirit" "sincere ideological demands" "artistic conscience"... etc., from which class content was removed, replacing the standpoint of the working class with the petty-bourgeois standpoint, replacing the ideological transformation of writers with creative practice; his erroneous theories were seen as arising from his misinterpretation of Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic theory. After Comrades Lin Mohan and He Qifang published two articles criticizing Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought, Hu Feng remained silent for several years, refusing to truly examine himself. We merely thought that it was due to Hu Feng's boastful, self-important emotions, as well as the progressive baggage of the struggle between the Hu Feng clique and Zhu Guangqian's aesthetic thought.

    For a long time, we were deceived by Hu Feng's beautiful facade, never doubting his so-called "petty-bourgeois revolutionary nature and standpoint." However, the facts tell us that Hu Feng has his reactionary stance, his "subjective fighting spirit" "struggle demands" are not supra-class concepts, Hu Feng's "subjective fighting spirit" is bourgeois, he "fights" for the "demands" of the bourgeoisie; his "enthusiasm" for hating progressive writers and being hostile to the literary and artistic movement led by the Party has "burned" to such a climax that he scolded the comrades in charge of the Party's literary and artistic leadership work as "powerful figures" "judges" "young masters" "mandarin gowns"; he slandered the realist writer Mr. Mao Dun as a "rising philistine," and even more slanderously accused Mr. Wen Yiduo, a poet and warrior who died under the guns of secret agents for democracy and freedom, as a "speculator." Hu Feng, you have more eloquence, but it is in vain. Your reactionary stance is clearly revealed, undeniable, and has reached the point of madness.

    The seemingly splendid "My Self-Criticism" can no longer deceive, and hypocritical tears are useless. The Hu Feng faction must quickly shed all disguises.

　  他们比强盗更可怕
    凌寒
    读到了舒芜所揭发的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”，使我万分地震骇和愤慨！我虽然是清华大学水利系的学生，但是对胡风的反党的文艺思想一直是注意的。十多年来胡风在马克思列宁主义词句的外衣下，竟抱着“与阵地共存亡”的决心疯狂地反对党和党所领导的文艺运动。假如胡风赤裸裸地供出他的反动立场，他的反动文艺思想，人们就容易看清楚胡风小集团的真面目，早就用扫帚把它们清除净尽了。可是骗子手比强盗更可怕，就在于骗子手比强盗还缺乏真诚。胡风十多年来演着骗子手的角色，连一点坦白的真诚也没有。他把自己装扮成为左翼文艺理论家，掩藏着他的丑恶面目；招摇撞骗，自树一帜，聚众向人民的文艺事业、向进步作家行凶。胡风对于骗子手的伎俩已精通到极点了，的确，他不愧是反动势力中一名狡猾而出色的打手。
    在这以前，胡风那一套掉包的办法：以抽掉了阶级内容的“主观战斗精神”“真诚的思想要求”
  “艺术良心”……等等代替工人阶级的世界观，以小资产阶级的立场代替工人阶级的立场，以创作实践代替作家的思想改造；他的错误的理论我们只看作是由于他对马克思列宁主义文艺理论的错误理解而来的。在林默涵、何其芳二同志发表了两篇批判胡风的文艺思想的文章以后，数年来胡风默默无声，拒不真正检讨，我们也仅仅认为是胡风那种夸夸其谈、自命不凡的情绪，以及背着胡风小集团曾与朱光潜的美学思想作过斗争的进步包袱所使然。
    长期以来，我们被胡风的漂亮外衣迷惑了，从没有怀疑过他自己所谓的“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”。可是，事实告诉我们，胡风有他的反动立场，他的“主观战斗精神”“斗争要求”不是超阶级的概念，胡风的“主观战斗精神”是资产阶级的，他为了资产者的“要求”而“战斗”；他仇视进步作家，敌视党所领导的文艺运动的“热情”竟“燃烧”到了如此的顶点，他责骂党的负责文艺领导工作的同志为“权贵”“法官”“公子”“马褂”；他诬蔑现实主义的作家茅盾先生是“抬头的市侩”，他更诬蔑为民主自由而死在特务手枪下的诗人和战士的闻一多先生为“投机”。胡风，你有更多的辩才也是徒然的，你的反动立场昭然若揭，不容抵赖，而且已经达到丧心病狂的程度了。
    伪装得堂皇的“我的自我批判”不能起欺骗的作用了，伪善的眼泪也是没有用的。胡风派必须赶快脱下一切伪装。
