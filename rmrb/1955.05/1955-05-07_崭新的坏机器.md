　　Brand New, Broken Machines
　　Huang Kejun
    Key projects are the lifeblood of socialist construction. They relate to the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country. Therefore, the state strives to save money and invest in purchasing the machines needed for the construction of these projects to replace heavy manual labor and ensure the progress and quality of the projects. Factories producing machines should regard these machine orders as the most glorious task and complete them conscientiously and on time. However, the state-owned Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has taken the opposite attitude towards this work, using deceptive means of passing off inferior products as good ones to deal with key project orders.
    In February of this year, the Luoyang Engineering Bureau transported ten electric winches produced by the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant from the distant northeast. At the same time, there were ten machine inspection certificates, stamped with the seals of Jia Zonggui, the head of the plant's technical inspection section, and the inspector. These ten machines looked good on the surface, but in reality, they were all unusable, brand new, broken machines. One of them had as many as ten faults, and these faults were not caused by insufficient manufacturing technology. Now let's take a look at where these faults are! First of all, machines should be test-run and inspected before leaving the factory, but the plant simply did not do this, because some of the machines could not turn on at all. Secondly, they were crudely made: the butter in the grease cups on the winch should have been injected into the bearings to prevent overheating, but the grease cup eyes in the machines produced by the plant were not straight, and the butter leaked out. The winch was originally intended to lift building materials, etc., but the plant forgot the device on the winch for the steel wire rope used when lifting building materials. Therefore, the steel wire rope could not be installed, and as a result, the machine was completely unusable. Thirdly, materials were cut: the oil pipe should have been screwed into the screw hole to prevent it from falling off, but in order to facilitate assembly, the plant did not hesitate to knock the oil pipe small and insert it into the hole. In short, these ten machines were plagued with problems.
    This kind of deceptive, irresponsible practice of passing off inferior products as good ones makes us wonder whether the plant is supporting key projects or sabotaging them? Is it creating property for the country or wasting state property? I hope the leaders of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant will answer this question.

　　崭新的坏机器
　　黄克俊
    重点工程是社会主义建设的命根子，它关系到全国人民的根本利益，所以国家努力节约，投资购买这些工程施工中所需用的机器，以代替繁重的体力劳动，以保证工程进度和质量。生产机器的工厂都应该把这些机器订货当作最光荣的任务，并且认真地按期地完成。但是国营沈阳第一机床厂对待这个工作却采取了相反的态度，用以坏充好的欺骗手段来对待重点工程订货。
    今年二月，洛阳工程局从遥远的东北运到沈阳第一机床厂出产的电动卷扬机十台。同时带有机器检查合格证十份，并盖有该厂技术检查科科长贾宗贵和检查员的图章。这十部机器从外表看来好像还不错，但实际上全部是不能使用的崭新的坏机器。其中一台，毛病竟达十处之多，而这些毛病并不是由于制造技术水平不够而造成的。现在让我们来看看这些毛病在哪里吧！首先，一般机器出厂前应该试车检验，但该厂根本没有这样做，因为有几台机器根本不能转动。其次是粗制滥造：卷扬机上的牛油杯中的牛油本来应该注入轴承内以防止发热，但是该厂出产的机器中的牛油杯眼子不正，牛油都漏到外面去了。卷扬机本来是吊建筑材料等用的，该厂竟忘记了吊建筑材料时所用的钢丝绳需搭在绞车上的装置，因此钢丝绳不能装上去，结果这部机器根本无法使用。第三是偷工减料：灌油管本来应该旋入螺丝孔内，防止脱落，该厂为了便于装配，不惜用油管敲小后插入孔内。总之，这十台机器是百病丛生。
    这种掩人耳目，不负责任，以坏充好的做法，使我们怀疑该厂究竟是支援重点工程呢？还是破坏重点工程呢？究竟在为国家创造财产呢？还是浪费国家财产呢？希望沈阳第一机床厂的领导上答复这个问题。
