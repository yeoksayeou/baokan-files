　　Workers' Cartoons
　　Tong Heng
    The "First Workers' Amateur Art Creation Exhibition," which opened in the capital on the eve of the "May 1st" International Labor Day, exhibited 324 works from seventeen provinces and cities and three industrial units. Many works aroused great interest among the audience. In particular, the cartoon section had many excellent works, showing that workers have a high talent for cartoon creation.
    There were a total of 119 cartoons on display, accounting for more than one-third of all the works in the exhibition. Workers are more inclined to cartoons when they study fine arts and create in their spare time, which is a feature of current workers' art activities.
    In many factories, mines, construction sites, and enterprises, cartoons vividly publicize the Party's policies, promote production, encourage labor enthusiasm, and conduct self-criticism and self-education, generating a great effect. Some factories and units also publish cartoon wall newspapers regularly, such as the "Iron and Steel Pictorial" of Chongqing No. 101 Steel Plant, which has been published weekly since its inception in June last year; and the "Everyone Draws" of Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Mill, which is published three times a month and has been published 24 times by March this year, with a total of more than 520 paintings published. Because cartoons reflect problems quickly, sharply, and humorously, the masses are very welcome and the effect is often very good. It is said that there was such a thing: Last July, Chongqing No. 101 Steel Plant did not complete the production task of steel, and the "Iron and Steel Pictorial" published such a cartoon, depicting a large bridge that had not yet been built, with construction workers sitting idle under the bridge, and a person next to them asking: "Why are you sitting and resting instead of working?" The construction workers replied: "We are waiting for the steel from the No. 101 plant!" The title of the painting was a sentence that everyone in the factory often said at the time: "Strongly support the Wuhan Bridge." The workers in the factory were very moved after seeing this painting. Some steel rolling workers said: "We have to work harder, and if we don't complete the task, it will affect the national construction." There was also such a thing: In the family dormitory of Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Mill, several water pipes were broken, and the water was running day and night, causing a considerable waste. Some people suggested repairs several times, but they were always delayed. After the cartoon titled "Let the Water Flow Freely" appeared in "Everyone Draws", the general affairs section immediately sent someone to repair the water pipes. In units where cartoon work is done well, cartoons have a certain prestige among the masses. The masses like cartoons, support cartoons, and are also willing to provide cartoon themes. For example, on the flood control construction site in Wuhan last year (where the cartoon propaganda work was quite active at that time), one day, a worker ran to several other workers who could draw cartoons and said:
  "It's really annoying, ××× is strong and young, but he pulls the rope crooked when pulling the cart..." (meaning he doesn't use force to pull the cart), and asked to draw it into a cartoon to criticize this kind of person.
    In this way, cartoons have taken root among the workers and masses, laid a broad mass foundation, and developed vigorously. Only by closely linking cartoons with the lives of the masses can they penetrate into the masses, be cared for and accepted by the masses, and only by always standing on the advanced, just, and correct position to speak for the masses can they win the support and love of the masses and generate the power of propaganda and education.
    In this exhibition, there are many excellent cartoon works, many of which have played a great role at that time and place. Just to give a few examples: Cheng Yuanzhong's "Comrade, Please Stand Up!" from the Anshan Iron and Steel Design Institute is a very good cartoon. This was created by the author in response to the conservative thinking of some designers in his unit who believed that the design quota was set too high. He drew a high jump frame with the crossbar placed very low at the bottom of the frame, and a person was squatting under the crossbar, raising his arms and shouting: "The quota is too high!" Obviously, if this person is willing to stand up, he can jump over that height without much effort. This cartoon helped those designers overcome their conservative ideas because it was appropriately satirical, powerful, and interesting. Wang Longsheng's "Leave of Absence" is very interesting. The author is a worker from Wuhan Shenxin Yarn Factory, who started learning cartoons in 1953, and "Leave of Absence" was his first creation. At that time, their factory was rectifying labor discipline, and some young workers feigned illness to ask for leave to go to the theater, restaurants, and fall in love. In order to criticize this bad habit, he drew this cartoon, which depicts: In the field, a pair of young men and women are talking in a tent made of "leave slips", and the factory is smoking in the distance, which can be imagined that many workers are working hard there. In this way, the erroneous behavior of using sick leave as a guise, deceiving the organization, and disregarding production is clearly exposed on the screen. After this cartoon was posted in the unit, it was warmly welcomed by the masses, and the situation of pretending to be sick and asking for leave was greatly reduced. A cartoon by Liu Jiaji of Beijing Zhenhua Oil Factory has also been well received. He drew many leaking oil drums, with oil leaking all over the ground. It happened that a person walked by, but he did not feel any heartache for such a large loss of state property. He was only worried about getting his shoes dirty. He took off his shoes, held them in his hands, and walked proudly barefoot on the oily ground, muttering: "Don't oil my shoes!" This painting is not only of great educational significance to those who love private interests and do not love public interests, but also alerts the bureaucracy in leadership. -- It is said that a responsible comrade of the Oil and Grease Company immediately notified the warehouse managers under his command after seeing this painting, and carefully inspected the oil drums. If any leaks were found, they must be welded quickly to avoid leakage after the weather turned warm and the oil and grease melted. There are many such works in the cartoons on display.
    Zheng Tongxiao, a shop worker at Shanghai Marilyn Woolen Company, created a cartoon called "'Criticism' and 'Self-Criticism'" which is a creative and quite successful work in its expression. In the upper half, he drew a person smiling and gently dusting himself with a feather duster, saying that this is called "self-criticism"; in the lower half, he drew the same person violently hitting people with the handle of the same feather duster, saying that this is called "criticizing others." This is so wonderful. The two ends of the same feather duster, the two faces of the same person, so profoundly satirize the wrong attitude of being lenient to oneself and strict to others in this "criticism and self-criticism". Workers understand humor very well. In many of their works, whether it is the depiction of images, the arrangement of plots, or the use of idioms and metaphors, they can give the audience a sense of humor. The titles and descriptions are also very meaningful. Hu Fuqing, a porter from Dinghai, Zhejiang, drew a very interesting cartoon. The picture is also divided into two parts, the upper part shows: A guest walks into the manager's office of a glass factory, as if to visit or inspect the work. He said to the manager: "The masses reflect that the quality of the glass cups produced by your factory is not good." The lower part shows: The manager listened to the guest's words, revealing a very dissatisfied expression, and said: "It's a joke, the finished products have all been inspected...," and poured a cup of boiling water to entertain the guest: "Please sit down... have some tea..." Unexpectedly, this annoying glass cup could not withstand the hot water and shattered. The title is: "Facts Speak for Themselves." Look, what a powerful and humorous satire! Li Dingwu, a printing worker from the Beijing People's Bank of China Printing Factory, drew "Listening to Reports and Watching Plays," depicting a certain comrade always rushing to sit in the front seats when watching plays, and proudly bragging to others: "I'm sure to sit in the first row!" But this comrade hid in the last row of seats when listening to the report. Everyone else listened attentively and took notes carefully. As for him, he slept soundly. The plot of such a painting is interesting, and the image is vivid. Anyone who reads it will laugh. This kind of laughter is the ridicule of uprightness towards unhealthy tendencies, and it is a force that destroys all old ideas and bad habits.
    A major feature of workers' cartoon creation is that the themes of their works are mostly closely related to their production, struggle, and daily life. They rarely create out of thin air, shoot aimlessly, or find a basis from other people's existing works to carry out "creation." The forms of expression are often full of fighting spirit and a kind of everydayness, vivid images and humorous tastes. Although some works still have shortcomings in painting skills, the simple, authentic, and unpretentious style makes people feel lovely. Most of these amateur painters among workers are activists with a high degree of awareness and close ties with the masses. In the organized collective life, they not only have rich life experience, but also are good at judging the advanced and backward things in life fairly and selflessly. They observe life and analyze problems responsibly and sensitively at any time and place with the spirit of patriotism and the attitude of masters, with the standpoint and viewpoint of the proletariat, and resolutely struggle against all non-proletarian thoughts. This is the main reason why the themes of workers' cartoon creation are clear, their love and hatred are distinct, their expressions are sharp and powerful, and they are full of the breath of life. This is worthy of attention and learning by professional painters, especially cartoon workers.
    The role played by workers' cartoon creation in recent years should be valued by the leaders of factories, mines, construction sites, enterprises and trade unions at all levels. At present, the literary and artistic activities of some units focus on drama, song and dance, and do not pay attention to art at all; some units only limit the content of art activities to writing slogans, decorating gates, and arranging meeting places for festivals; some units are even afraid of the sharp criticism of cartoons, and even more afraid that cartoons will satirize bureaucracy and "damage the prestige of leaders." This attitude is wrong and divorced from the masses. We should pay attention to discovering the cartoon talents and cartoon enthusiasts among the workers in our units, give them cultivation, encouragement, and support, and provide them with the conditions and convenience needed for amateur study and creation. Cartoons should not be a temporary embellishment of shock, but should be a regular mass education tool and a powerful weapon on the ideological front in socialist construction and socialist transformation!

　　工人的漫画
　　同衡
    “五一”国际劳动节前夕在首都开幕的“第一届工人业余美术创作展览会”，展出了包括十七个省、市和三个产业单位的出品三百二十四件，许多作品使观众感到极大的兴趣，特别是漫画部分，有不少优秀的作品，显示了工人们在漫画创作上有很高的才能。
    展出的漫画共有一百十九幅，占展览会全部作品的三分之一以上。工人们业余学习美术、进行创作，比较偏好于漫画，这是目前工人美术活动中的一个特点。
    漫画在许多工厂、矿场、工地和企业中，形象化地宣传党的政策，推动生产，鼓舞劳动热情，进行自我批评和自我教育，产生了很大的作用。有些工厂单位还定期地出版漫画墙报，例如：重庆一○一钢铁厂的“钢铁画报”，从去年六月创刊以来，每周出刊一次；天津棉纺六厂的“大家画”，每月出刊三次，到今年三月已出二十四期，共刊登了五百二十多幅画。由于漫画反映问题迅速而且尖锐、幽默，群众非常欢迎，效果也多很好。据说有这么一回事：去年七月份，重庆一○一钢铁厂没有完成钢材的生产任务，“钢铁画报”便发表了这样一幅漫画，画着一座尚未建成的大桥，建筑工人在桥下闲坐着，旁边一人问道：“为什么不工作却坐着休息呢？”建筑工人的回答是：“我们正在等一○一厂的钢材呀！”画的题目是厂里当时大家口头上常说的一句话：“大力支持武汉大桥。”厂里的工人们看了这幅画，很受感动，有的轧钢工人说：“要加劲干啦，我们完不成任务就要影响国家建设哩。”还有这么一回事：天津棉纺六厂的家属宿舍，有好几个自来水管都坏了，整天整夜地流水，浪费的现象是相当严重的。有人几次建议修理，但总是拖延不决，等到“大家画”上出现了题为“任水自流”的那幅漫画以后，总务科立刻就派人检修了自来水管。在漫画工作做得较好的单位，漫画在群众中都有一定的威信，群众喜爱漫画，支持漫画，还乐意提供漫画的题材。例如去年武汉的防汛工地上（那里的漫画宣传工作当时曾是相当活跃的），有一天，一个工人跑来对另几个能画漫画的工人说：
  “真气人，×××膀大腰圆、年青力壮，拉车子却把绳子都给拉弯了……”（意思是不用劲拉车），要求画成漫画给这种人好好批评一下。
    漫画，就是这样在工人群众中扎下根，打下广大的群众基础，并蓬勃地发展起来。漫画，只有密切地跟群众生活联系起来，才能深入到群众中去，为群众所关心和接受，也只有永远站在先进的正义的正确立场为群众说话，才能获得群众的拥护和热爱，产生宣传教育的力量。
    这次展览会中，优秀的漫画作品是很多的，其中有不少都曾在当时当地起过很大的作用。随便举几个例子来说：鞍钢黑色金属设计院程远忠的“同志，请您站起来吧！”就是一幅很好的漫画。这是作者针对着当时本单位部分设计人员认为设计定额定得太高的保守思想而作的。他画着一个跳高架子，横竿搁在架子下端很低的地方，有一个人正蹲在横竿底下高举着手臂嚷叫：“定额太高了！”很显然，这个人如果肯站起来，他是能够不怎么费力地跳过那个高度的。这幅漫画，由于讽刺得恰当，有力而且有趣，曾帮助了那些设计人员克服了保守思想。汪龙生的“请假单”，画得很有意思。作者是武汉申新纱厂的工人，一九五三年才开始学习漫画，“请假单”是他第一次的创作。当时他们厂里正整顿劳动纪律，有些青工装病请了假去看戏、上馆子、闹恋爱，为了批评这种坏作风，他画了这一幅漫画，画的是：野外，用“请假单”搭成的一顶帐篷里，一对男女青工正在谈情，远处的工厂冒着烟，可以想像，那里有许多工人是在紧张地工作着。这样，以病假为幌子、欺骗组织、不顾生产的那种错误行为，在画面上被清楚地揭露了。这幅漫画在本单位贴出后，受到群众热烈的欢迎，装病请假的情况大大减少。北京振华油厂刘家骥作的一幅漫画，也颇得好评。他画着许多漏了的油桶，漏了满地的油，正巧有一个人走过，但他对于国家资财的如此大量耗损，竟毫不感到心痛，只是很担心搞脏了自己的鞋，他就把鞋脱下，提在手里，光着脚在油地上昂然走了过去，嘴里还咕哝着：“别油了我的鞋！”这幅画不但对于那些爱私不爱公的人有很大的教育意义，并且也警惕了领导上的官僚主义。——据说油脂公司有一位负责同志，当时看了这幅画，曾马上通知所属的仓库管理员，认真检查油桶，如发现漏洞，必须赶紧焊好，免得天气转暖后油脂化了要渗漏出来。展出的漫画中，像这样的作品是很多的。
    上海玛琍呢绒号的店员工人郑通校的漫画“‘批评’和‘自我批评’”是在表现方法上富有创造性和相当成功的作品。他在上半幅画着一个人正微笑着用鸡毛帚轻轻拂拭自己，说这叫做“自我批评”；在下半幅画着同一个人正粗暴地用同一把鸡毛帚的柄在打人，说这叫做“批评别人”。这真是太妙了，同一把鸡毛帚的两端，同一个人的两副面孔，多么深刻地讽刺了对自己宽恕、对别人严厉的这种错误的“批评和自我批评”的态度。工人们是很懂得幽默的，在他们的不少作品中，不论是形象的刻划、情节的安排，或是成语、比喻的运用，都能给观众以幽默感。题目和说明，也有很多是意味深长的。浙江定海一位搬运工人胡福青的一幅漫画，画得很有趣。画面也分上下两部分，上边画的是：一位客人走进了一家玻璃厂的经理室，像是来访问或是来检查工作的，他对经理说：“群众反映，你厂出品的玻璃杯质量不好。”下边画的是：经理听了客人的话，流露出很不满意的神情，一面说：“笑话，成品都是检验过的……，”一面倒杯开水招待客人：“请坐……喝茶……。”不料，这个讨厌的玻璃杯却经不起开水一烫，炸碎了。题目就叫：“事实说话了。”瞧，这是多么有力和幽默的讽刺！北京中国人民银行印刷厂的印刷工人李定武的“听报告和看戏”，画着某同志在看戏时，总是抢坐最前面的座位，还很得意地向别人夸耀：“我准坐第一排！”但是这位同志在听报告时，却躲在最后一排的座位上，别人都静心地听，专心地记，他呢，呼呼地睡了。这样的画，情节既有趣，形象也生动，读者看了，谁都会发笑，这种笑，就是正气对于歪风的嘲笑，是摧毁一切旧思想和坏作风的一种力量。
    工人的漫画创作，有一个很大的特点：他们作品的题材，绝大部分都是同他们的生产、斗争和日常的生活密切联系着的，很少凭空臆造、无的放矢，或从别人现成的作品中去找根据来进行“创作”；在表现形式上也往往充满了战斗精神和亲切的生活气息、生动的形象和幽默的趣味。虽然有些作品在绘画技术上还存在着缺点，但是那种朴素、真实、毫不做作的作风，令人感到可爱。这些工人中的业余画家，大部分是觉悟程度较高、联系群众较密切的积极分子，他们在有组织地劳动的集体生活中，不仅有丰富的生活经验，而且善于公正无私地判别生活中先进和落后的东西，随时随地以爱国主义的精神和主人翁的态度、以无产阶级的立场和观点，负责地敏感地观察生活、分析问题，同一切非无产阶级的思想进行坚决的斗争。这就是工人的漫画创作所以主题明确、爱憎分明、表现得尖锐有力，充满了生活气息的主要原因。这是专业画家们特别是漫画工作者值得注意学习的。
    工人漫画创作近年来所起的作用，应引起各地工厂、矿场、工地、企业和各级工会领导的重视。现在有些单位的文艺活动偏重于戏剧、歌舞，而根本不注意美术；有些单位也仅仅把美术活动的内容限制在写标语、装饰大门、布置会场等节日的突击工作上；有些单位甚至还害怕漫画的尖锐批评，更害怕漫画讽刺官僚主义“损害领导威信”，这种态度是错误的，是脱离群众的。我们应该注意发现本单位工人中的漫画天才和漫画爱好者，给予培养、鼓励、支持，给予业余学习和创作上所需要的条件以及工作上的便利。漫画不能是突击性的临时点缀，应该是经常性的群众教育的工具，是社会主义建设和社会主义改造中思想战线上的有力的武器！
