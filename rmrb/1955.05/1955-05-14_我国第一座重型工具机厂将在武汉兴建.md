　　China's First Heavy Machinery Plant to be Built in Wuhan

　　China's first heavy machinery plant will be built in Wuhan. Currently, construction preparations are being stepped up, and some preparatory engineering work has already begun.

　　The Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant will be a highly automated factory with powerful production capabilities. It will utilize the latest technological achievements in Soviet heavy machine tool manufacturing and will be constructed with the help of Soviet experts. The future factory will produce many kinds of high-performance, versatile heavy machine tools, including vertical lathes, gantry planers, spiral milling machines, horizontal boring machines, and gantry milling machines. These heavy machine tools have never been manufactured in China before. Once completed, this factory will greatly improve the manufacturing level of China's machinery industry and supply the growing needs of national economic construction for heavy machinery.

　　Preparations for the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant began as early as the second quarter of 1953. By the first quarter of this year, work such as surveying the factory site, collecting design materials, and compiling the overall construction plan had been completed successively, and large-scale cultivation and training of construction and production personnel had begun. The vast majority of the management cadres and technical personnel gathered by the factory have been sent to relevant domestic factories and the Soviet Union for study in 1954. More than 500 people are studying in machine tool factories in Shenyang, Qiqihar, Jinan, Shanghai, and Chongqing. These cadres and technical personnel have made rapid progress in their studies, and they will gradually return to the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant to work this year and next year. In order to meet the needs of large-scale factory construction and production in the future, the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant has decided to further strengthen the cultivation and training of personnel. A new cultivation and training plan has recently been prepared and has already begun to be implemented. (Reported by Xinhua News Agency)

　　在社会主义的道路上前进
　　我国第一座重型工具机厂将在武汉兴建
    我国第一座重型工具机厂将在武汉兴建。现在，施工准备工作正在加紧进行，一部分准备性质的工程已经开始施工。
    武汉重型工具机厂将是一个高度自动化的生产力强大的工厂。它将利用苏联重型工具机制造业方面的最新技术成就，并将在苏联专家帮助下进行建设。未来的这座工厂将出产许多种性能优良、用途广泛的重型机床，其中包括有立式车床、龙门刨床、螺旋铣床、卧式镗床、龙门铣床等。这些重型机床是我国从来没有制造过的。这个工厂建成以后，将大大提高我国机械工业的制造水平，并供应国家经济建设对重型机器愈来愈多的需要。
    武汉重型工具机厂的筹建工作早在一九五三年第二季度就开始了。到今年第一季度，勘测厂址、搜集设计资料、编制建厂总体计划等工作都已先后完成，并已经着手大量培养训练建设和生产人材。这个工厂已经集结起来的管理干部和技术人员，绝大多数已经在一九五四年先后派到国内有关工厂和苏联去学习。仅在沈阳、齐齐哈尔、济南、上海和重庆等地机床厂学习的就有五百多人。这些干部和技术人员在学习中进步都比较快，他们将在今年和明年内陆续回到武汉重型工具机厂担任工作。为适应今后大规模建厂和生产的需要，武汉重型工具机厂已经决定进一步加强培养和训练人材的工作。新的培养训练计划已经在最近编制就绪，并已开始施行。　（据新华社讯）
