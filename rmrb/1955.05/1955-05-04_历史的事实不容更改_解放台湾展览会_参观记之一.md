Historical Facts Cannot Be Changed
　　——A Visit to the "Liberate Taiwan Exhibition" (Part 1)
　　By Our Correspondent Lin Gang
The "Liberate Taiwan Exhibition" uses irrefutable historical facts to eloquently demonstrate that Taiwan has been an integral part of our country since ancient times.

The exhibition presents the rich and beautiful Taiwan to us. It is one of the granaries of the motherland, where rice can be harvested twice a year. The fertile fields produce sugarcane, tea, and sweet potatoes, and tropical fruits grow all year round. Taiwan is a famous orchard of our country. Traversing the island are high mountains and lush primeval forests, which produce many excellent timbers. Taiwan supplies 40 percent of the world's camphor, and its quality is also the best in the world. The countless streams and waterfalls cascading down from the high mountains provide inexhaustible potential for hydropower generation. The waters around Taiwan offer inexhaustible resources of fish and salt, and the underground is rich in gold, silver, copper, coal, and oil and other treasures.

This precious island of the motherland has been developed and built by the hard work of Taiwan compatriots for thousands of years, and every inch of its land is soaked with the blood and sweat of the Chinese people.

But today, the armed forces of the United States have occupied Taiwan. After sending an invading fleet to Taiwan, American diplomats proclaimed that if the Chinese people liberate Taiwan, it will seriously threaten the security of the United States! They also say that the status of Taiwan has not yet been determined! What absurd and shameless sophistry this is!

Taiwan is a land island. From a geographical point of view, it is a continuation of our mainland. The depth of the Taiwan Strait generally does not exceed eighty meters. For the entire ocean, a strait of eighty meters is very shallow. Only beyond the east coast of Taiwan is the abyss of more than three thousand meters. That is the border of our motherland.

The geographical situation of the Pacific region, reduced to a few millionths of its size, is made into a model and displayed here. People see that Taiwan is close to the mainland, with the closest point being only two hundred kilometers. The Taiwan Strait is docked with a fleet flying the Stars and Stripes. Where is the United States? We look east from Taiwan, to the vast ocean, boundless and limitless. The United States is 11,000 kilometers away from Taiwan, separated by an entire Pacific Ocean! Is it China that "threatens" the security of the United States? Or is it the United States that has occupied Chinese territory? Anyone can get the answer from here.

The exhibits in the historical section illustrate that as early as the beginning of the third century AD, that is, more than a thousand years before foreigners "discovered" Taiwan, the people of the coastal areas of our mainland had crossed the sea in large numbers, settled in Taiwan, and established their homes. During the Southern Song Dynasty (twelfth century), Taiwan was already included in our territory and belonged to Jinjiang County, Quanzhou Prefecture, Fujian Road (the "Road" of the Song Dynasty was equivalent to the current province). At that time, mankind did not yet know that there was a new continent of America in the world, and the founding of the United States was six hundred years later. The Yuan Dynasty set up the local government "Patrol Office" in Penghu to govern Taiwan and Penghu. At that time, trade between the mainland and Taiwan was quite developed, with sails connecting Fujian and Taiwan. In the Qing Dynasty, Taiwan Prefecture was established, under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province; later it was changed to a province, directly under the central government. During the half-century of Japanese occupation of Taiwan, all countries in the world recognized that Taiwan was Chinese.

The island has eight million residents, 97 percent of whom are Han Chinese, most of whom are descendants of our ancestors who crossed the sea from Fujian and Guangdong, and still speak "Southern Fujian dialect" and "Hakka dialect"; about 3 percent are Gaoshan (aboriginal) compatriots. In the photos, the tiled houses of the courtyard houses have flat and sloping roofs; on the threshing floor, a water buffalo is resting. The scene is like summer in Jiangnan. The Gaoshan compatriots' cloth wraps, buttoned clothes, bamboo water tubes, wooden pestles, pottery bowls, double-eared cups, rattan baskets, long-handled wooden shovels... are displayed here. Taiwan's culture is purely Chinese culture.

Western countries knew about Taiwan only 360 years ago. Colonial countries such as Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands, starting from the discovery of this "beautiful island" (the Portuguese called Taiwan "Formosa," the Italianate translation), have been constantly attempting to occupy it.

Zheng Chenggong, a national hero of the late Ming Dynasty, is a familiar heroic figure to the Chinese people. The contemporary artist's "Zheng Chenggong Recovers Chihkan" attracts a large audience. In the early 17th century (during the Tianqi period of the Ming Dynasty), the Dutch occupied Taiwan for thirty-eight years. Taiwan compatriots have always adhered to the struggle against foreign enslavement. In 1661, Zheng Chenggong led 25,000 naval forces, starting from Kinmen and Xiamen, to recover Taiwan. Wherever Zheng's army went, "pots of pulp welcomed them and filled the road." With the full support of Taiwan compatriots, Zheng Chenggong fought fiercely with the Dutch army for seven months. The final result was the complete annihilation of the Dutch invading army, which surrendered unconditionally. A magnified ancient Western copperplate engraving exhibited here depicts the scene of the Dutch army surrendering at that time. The surrender ceremony was held in the square near the military camp. Zheng Chenggong sat upright in the military tent, with flags fluttering on the tent and soldiers with spears guarding both sides. Two surrender envoys bowed and entered. Zheng Chenggong adopted a lenient policy at that time. After delivering the letter of surrender, the Dutch Governor of Taiwan, Kui Yi, led his remnants, defeated generals, officials and merchants, and fled back in disgrace. The first conquerors to arrive here were thus ignominiously expelled from Taiwan. This is the common end of all aggressors.

The historical materials displayed at the exhibition show that the American plot to invade Taiwan began in the 1850s. From the initial merchants and missionaries to the armed occupation today, it was originally a consistent policy of the United States to turn Taiwan into its own colony.

After the defeat of the Sino-Japanese War, the traitorous and humiliating Qing government ceded Taiwan. Upon hearing the news, the people of the whole country unanimously expressed their opposition. Taiwan compatriots cried out in pain. The "Taiwan Gentry's Proclamation to China and Foreign Countries" was full of blood and tears, and it was unbearable to read. The people of Taiwan declared sadly and indignantly: Rather fight to the death, we will never allow the cession of Taiwan. During the fifty years of Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945, the anti-aggression struggle of Taiwan compatriots was even more heroic and壮烈, advancing wave upon wave, and never ceasing. More than 500,000 compatriots heroically sacrificed their lives in the struggle. Here is the statue of Ke Tie, the leader of the peasant uprising, whose anti-Japanese army persisted in fighting against the Japanese in Pingding for five years. Luo Fuxing, an anti-Japanese soldier's, death poem before his heroic sacrifice is generous and tragic. More than 500 Gaoshan compatriots, led by Chief Mona Rudao, launched an uprising in Wushe. The Japanese invaders used airplanes, cannons and poison gas to suppress them. They used spears, daggers, bows and arrows as weapons, united as one, and persisted in the struggle for several months, until all men, women and children were gloriously sacrificed.

After Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, "requisitioned" Taiwan, Taiwan compatriots launched an island-wide armed struggle in February and March 1947. The arduous struggle of Taiwan compatriots against the bloody rule of the U.S. and Chiang is still ongoing.

History shows that Taiwan compatriots not only developed Taiwan, but also defended it with their lives and blood. These admirable and moving revolutionary historical facts also fully demonstrate the deep desire of Taiwan compatriots for the motherland and a free and happy life.

Because the world recognizes the undeniable historical fact that Taiwan is our country's territory, the Cairo Declaration also clearly stipulated that "the territories Japan has stolen from China, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, shall be returned to China." On October 25, 1945, the then Chinese government accepted the surrender of the Japanese army in Taiwan and declared that "Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are officially re-incorporated into the territory of China." From that time on, China resumed its sovereignty over Taiwan. Taiwan has become an inseparable part of Chinese territory not only in law but also in fact.

In order to cover up the U.S. aggression, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles insisted that Taiwan and Penghu have a so-called "special legal status" and "special international status"; British Foreign Secretary Eden also attempted to prove that Taiwan "has never been a part of China" in this century. What an ugly disregard for international credibility! However, the facts of history cannot be obliterated by any madman. Several important international documents are displayed in the exhibition. Here is the "United States Foreign Relations Documents" compiled and printed by Princeton University, which publishes the "Cairo Declaration," "Potsdam Proclamation," and "Japanese Surrender Terms." These international documents signed by the heads of state of the United States and the United Kingdom clearly stipulated that Taiwan belongs to China and should be returned to China. Here is the White Paper on "Sino-US Relations," which states that according to the Cairo Declaration, "the United States and China declared that Taiwan should be returned to China." Here is a photo of the then Chinese government accepting the surrender and the Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, Ando Riki, signing the surrender document. Black and white, witnesses and material evidence are all present, cannot be denied or tampered with!

History is solemn! Lies cannot cover up the facts! Solemn international agreements must not be violated! Taiwan was, is, and will always be Chinese territory! The eight million Taiwan compatriots are sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. In order to defend the integrity of the motherland's territory and sovereignty, and to defend world peace, the Chinese people must complete the sacred cause of liberating Taiwan!

　　历史的事实不容更改
　　——“解放台湾展览会”参观记之一
　　本报记者　林钢
    “解放台湾展览会”以确凿的历史事实，雄辩地说明了台湾自古以来就是我国的领土。
    展览会把富饶而美丽的台湾呈现在我们面前。这儿是祖国的谷仓之一，稻米年可两熟。沃野上盛产甘蔗、茶叶和甘薯，还终年生长着热带水果。台湾是我国著名的大果园。纵贯全岛的是高峻的山脉和葱郁茂密的原始森林，这里出产许多优良的木材。台湾供给世界以百分之四十的樟脑，它的质量也是世界第一的。从高山上倾泻下来的无数溪流和瀑布，给水力发电提供了无穷的潜力。台湾的海面有取之不尽的渔盐，地底埋藏着丰富的金、银、铜、煤和石油等宝藏。
    祖国的这座宝岛，是台湾同胞千百年来用辛勤的劳动开发和建设起来的，它的每一寸土地都浸透着中国人民的血汗。
    但是，今天，美国的武装力量侵占了台湾。在派遣侵略的舰队来到台湾以后，美国的外交家们宣传说：如果中国人民解放台湾，将会严重威胁美国的安全！又说：台湾的地位尚未决定！这是何等荒谬无耻的诡辩！
    台湾是一个陆岛。从地理环境上说，它是我们祖国大陆的延续部分。台湾海峡的深度，一般不超过八十公尺。对于整个海洋说来，八十公尺的海峡是很浅的。台湾东海岸以外，才是三千公尺以上的深渊。那儿是我们祖国的边界。
    太平洋地区的地理形势，被缩小为几百万分之一，作成模型，陈列在这里。人们看见，台湾紧挨着大陆，最近处不过二百公里。台湾海峡停泊着扯着星条旗的舰队。美国在那里呢？我们从台湾朝东望，辽阔的海洋，无边无际。美国远离台湾一万一千公里，隔着整整一个太平洋！究竟是中国“威胁”着美国的安全呢？还是美国侵占了中国的领土呢？任何人都可以从这里得到答案。
    历史部分的展品说明：远在公元三世纪初叶，也就是在外国“发现”台湾的一千多年以前，我国内地沿海地区的人民，就已大批渡海，移居台湾，建立起自己的家园。南宋时候（十二世纪），台湾已列入我国版图，属福建路（宋代的“路”，相当于现在的省）泉州晋江县。那个时候，人类还不知道世界上有个美洲新大陆，美国立国更是六百年以后的事。元朝在澎湖设置地方政府“巡检司”，管辖台湾和澎湖。那时大陆和台湾的贸易往来已相当发达了，闽台之间，帆樯相接。清朝，设台湾府，属福建省管；后改行省，直属中央。在日本侵占台湾的半个世纪里，世界各国公认台湾是中国的。
    岛上现有八百万居民，百分之九十七是汉族，他们大都是从福建、广东渡海过来的我们先民的后裔，至今说的是“闽南话”和“客家话”；约有百分之三是高山族同胞。照片上，四合院的瓦房，屋脊平斜；打谷场上，一条水牛在歇晌。那情景宛如江南之夏。高山族同胞的布围、钮扣衣、竹水筒、木杵、陶碗、双耳杯、藤篮、长柄木?……陈列在这里。台湾的文化纯粹是中国文化。
    西方国家知道台湾，不过是三百六十年以前的事。葡萄牙、西班牙、荷兰等殖民国家从发现这个“美丽之岛”（葡人称台湾为“福摩萨”的意译）起，就不断企图侵占它。
    明末民族英雄郑成功是我国人民所熟悉的英雄人物。当代艺术家创作的“郑成功收复赤嵌图”吸引了众多的观众。十七世纪初（明朝天启年间），荷兰人侵占台湾三十八年。台湾同胞始终坚持着反抗外国奴役的斗争。一六六一年，郑成功率领两万五千水军，从金门、厦门出发，去收复台湾。郑师到处，“壶浆迎者塞道”郑成功在台湾同胞全力支援下，和荷军激战七月，终局是荷兰侵略军全军覆没，无条件投降。这里展出的一张放大了的西洋古代铜版画，描绘了荷军当时求降的情景。受降仪式在军营近旁的广场举行。郑成功端坐军帐，帐篷上旗幡飘扬，手持长矛的兵士护卫两旁。两名投降使节，鞠躬而进。郑成功当时采取了宽大政策。在这里递进了降书，荷兰台湾总督揆一带着他的残兵败将、官吏商贾，狼狈地逃回去了。最先来到这里的征服者，就这样不名誉地被驱逐出了台湾。这是一切侵略者的共同的下场。
    展览会上陈列的史料说明，美国侵略台湾的阴谋，开始于十九世纪五十年代。从最初的商人、传教士，到今天实行武装侵占，原是美国奉行的变台湾为自己的殖民地的一贯政策。
    甲午战败，丧权辱国的满清政府拱手割让了台湾。全国人民闻讯，一致表示反对。台湾同胞更是痛哭呼号。“台湾绅民布告中外檄文”，字字血泪，不忍卒读。台湾人民悲愤地宣告：宁人人战死，决不许割让台湾。在一八九五年到一九四五年日本统治的五十年间，台湾同胞的反侵略斗争更是英勇壮烈，前仆后继，从来没有休止。五十万以上的同胞在斗争中英勇牺牲了生命。这里有农民起义领袖柯铁的塑像，他领导的抗日军队，在坪顶和日寇坚持斗争五年之久。抗日志士罗福星英勇牺牲前的绝命书，慷慨悲壮。高山族同胞五百多人，在酋长摩那·罗达奥领导下，在雾社地方起义。日寇使用飞机大炮和毒气来镇压，他们用标枪、短刀、弓箭作武器，万众一心，坚持斗争几个月，直至男女老幼全部壮烈牺牲。
    在美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石卖国集团“劫收”了台湾之后，台湾同胞在一九四七年二月至三月，发动了全省规模的武装斗争。台湾同胞反对美蒋血腥统治的严酷斗争目前仍在进行中。
    历史表明，台湾同胞不仅开发了台湾，而且用生命和鲜血保卫了它。这些可歌可泣的革命史实，也充分表现了台湾同胞向往祖国和自由幸福生活的深切愿望。
    由于举世公认台湾是我国领土这一不可动摇的历史事实，所以开罗宣言也明白规定要“使日本所窃取于中国的领土，例如满洲、台湾、澎湖群岛等，归还中国”。一九四五年十月二十五日，当时的中国政府接受了台湾日军的投降，并且宣布“台湾及澎湖列岛正式重入中国版图”。从那时起，中国恢复了对台湾的主权。台湾不仅在法律上，而且在事实上已成为中国领土不可分割的一部分。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯为了掩盖美国的侵略行为，硬说台湾和澎湖有一种所谓“特殊的法律地位”和
  “特殊的国际地位”；英国外交大臣艾登也企图证明，台湾在本世纪内“从来也不是中国的一部分”。这是多么丑恶的不顾国际信义的谎言！但是，历史的事实是任何狂人也抹煞不了的。展览会里陈列着若干重要的国际文件。这儿是美国普林斯敦大学编印的“美国对外关系文献”，上面刊载着“开罗宣言”“波茨坦公告”和“日本投降条款”。美国和英国的元首们在上面签了字的这些国际文件，都明白规定了，台湾属于中国，应当归还中国。这儿是“中美关系”白皮书，上面写着，根据开罗宣言，“美国和中国宣布台湾应归还中国”。这儿是当时中国政府受降和日本驻台湾总督安藤利吉在投降书上签字的照片。白纸黑字，人证物证俱在，抵赖不了，篡改不得！
    历史是严正的！谎言掩盖不了事实！庄严的国际协议不容许破坏！台湾过去是、现在是、将来仍然是中国的领土！八百万台湾同胞是中国民族的儿女。为了保卫祖国领土和主权的完整，为了保卫世界和平，中国人民一定要完成解放台湾的神圣事业！
