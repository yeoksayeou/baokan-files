    Machine Equipment Must Be Actively Maintained
    Kong Sang
    Shenyang Third Machine Tool Factory recently inspected 106 imported new machine tools. Among them, more than 35% were so severely damaged that they could not be restored, or there was no certainty of restoring, to their original precision. 25% were damaged quite severely and could only be restored to their original state after major repairs. As a result of the damage, the average service life of these hundred-plus machine tools has been reduced by half. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, and Dalian Hoisting Machinery Factory also have this phenomenon. More than 30 pieces of new equipment put into production by these three factories from 1950 to 1953 already require major repairs. In similar factories in the Soviet Union, the overhaul cycle for equipment is 15 years, while ours is 2 to 3 years. Theoretically, a machine tool should be scrapped after four major repairs. At this rate, many of the pieces of equipment we put into production during the first Five-Year Plan will become waste, or have reduced precision and efficiency, during the third Five-Year Plan. Just imagining this "prospect" is shocking.
    Some say that the reason for this situation is that a considerable number of workers have low technical skills and cannot skillfully master new machines. Of course, this is a fact. However, the problem also lies in the fact that the leaders of many enterprises only shout empty slogans about the low level of workers, but do not take measures to improve their skills. The situation of damage to new equipment in Nanjing Machine Tool Factory was once very serious. But when the factory leaders paid attention to this problem, they went deep into the workshops to understand the situation and discovered several advanced workers who cherished machine tools and never damaged machines. They summarized the experience of these people and promoted it throughout the factory, which quickly reduced the phenomenon of machine damage. This shows that low technical skills of workers cannot be the reason for the widespread, serious, and long-term failure to overcome the current phenomenon of equipment damage.
    The crux of the problem lies in the fact that in these enterprises, the system of maintaining and preserving equipment has not been established or implemented. In order to complete the immediate production tasks, the leaders of the enterprises often do not hesitate to adopt rush tactics. Machines that should be inspected and repaired are not inspected and repaired, and when they are damaged, they do not promptly find ways to remedy them. In their view, shortening the lifespan of equipment is never as "urgent" or as directly related to their own "reputation" as failing to complete the immediate task. With such leadership thinking, those workers who damage the equipment naturally receive "lenient" treatment. On the other hand, those who take good care of the equipment are less likely to be known and sometimes cannot help but feel that it is better to rush for output and create a new record for "both fame and fortune."
    This situation is very abnormal. Our long-term interests are consistent with our immediate interests, and cherishing machine equipment is consistent with completing production tasks. The two should not be opposed to each other, and one should not be sacrificed to obtain the other. Failure to complete the current production tasks will certainly affect the cause of industrialization; but destroying the foundation built up with hard work over the course of a hundred years in just a few years will be a greater damage to the cause of industrialization. In order to satisfactorily complete the combat missions entrusted to him, a soldier must first cherish his weapons as he cherishes his own eyes. Every enterprise must establish and resolutely implement a system of maintaining equipment, and those few who seriously damage equipment should be seriously dealt with according to labor discipline.

    必须积极维护机器设备
    孔桑
    沈阳第三机床厂最近检查了一百零六台进口的新机床，其中破损很厉害，已经没办法或没把握恢复原来精密度的有百分之三十五以上；破损相当厉害，经过大修才能恢复原状的占百分之二十五。破损的结果，这一百多台机床平均的使用期限已经减少了一半。沈阳重型机器厂、沈阳矿山机器厂和大连起重机器厂也有这种现象。这三个工厂一九五○年到一九五三年投入生产的新设备，已有三十多台需要大修。苏联类似工厂中设备的大修周期是十五年，而我们是二至三年。从理论上说，一台机床经过四次大修就要报废。这样算下来，我们在第一个五年计划中投入生产的设备，在第三个五年计划中就要有很多变成废物，或降低使用精度和效率。设想一下这幅“远景”，不能不令人震惊。
    有人说，所以造成这种状况，是因为相当多的工人技术水平低，不能熟练掌握新机器。当然，这是事实。可是，问题还在于许多企业的领导人员只是空喊工人水平低，却不采取措施去提高他们的水平。南京机床厂新设备损坏的情况曾经是很严重的。但当厂的领导人员重视了这个问题之后，便深入车间去了解，发现了好几个爱护机床、从来没有损坏过机器的先进工人。他们总结了这些人的经验，并在全厂推广之后，使机器损坏现象迅速减少了。这说明，工人技术水平低，不能成为目前设备损坏现象普遍、严重、而且长期未能克服的理由。
    问题的症结在于：在这些企业里，没有树立或没有贯彻维护和保养设备的制度。企业的领导人员为了完成眼前的生产任务，常常不惜采取突击的手段，机器该检修了不检修，损坏了也不及时设法补救。在他们看来，设备寿命缩短了，总没有完不成眼前的任务那样“紧要”，那样直接关系到自己的“声誉”。领导思想如此，那些损坏了设备的工人也就自然得到了“宽大”的待遇。而好好保养设备的人，反而不易为人所知，有时就不免觉得还不如突击产量、创造个新纪录，
  “名利双收”。
    这种状况是很不正常的。我们的长远利益同眼前利益是一致的，爱护机器设备同完成生产任务也是一致的，不能把二者对立起来，用牺牲这一个为代价来换取那一个。完不成当前的生产任务固然会影响工业化的事业；但把辛勤建设起来的百年的基础，在短短的几年中毁掉，对工业化事业将是更大的损害。一个兵士要完满地完成所肩负的战斗任务，首先就要像爱护自己的眼睛
  一般地爱护自己的武器。每个企业均必须树立和坚决贯彻维护设备的制度，对于少数严重损坏设备的人，应按劳动纪律严肃处理。
