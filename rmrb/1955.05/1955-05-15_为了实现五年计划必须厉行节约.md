To realize the Five-Year Plan, we must practice strict economy.

　　All kinds of economy in society ultimately aim to save working time, that is, to save living labor and materialized labor. Saving living labor means reducing the labor consumption of staff in each work and unit product. Saving materialized labor means reducing the consumption of material resources in each work and unit product. Therefore, the economy system requires the most rational utilization of human, material, and financial resources to achieve the best results with the least labor and material consumption.

　　The necessity of establishing a strict economy system is determined by the objective requirements of the socialist economic system itself and the basic socialist economic laws. The socialist system eliminates all forms of exploitation of man by man, and maximizing the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole society becomes the purpose of socialist production. Therefore, the development of the national economy can never accumulate funds by exploiting the domestic people and plundering the people of other countries, as is often used in capitalism, but can only rely on internal accumulation. In this way, economy is an extremely important means of increasing internal accumulation and correctly utilizing accumulation in the socialist economy. Only by establishing a strict economy system in all sectors of the national economy, meticulously reducing labor and material consumption in each work and unit product, can we accumulate the huge amount of funds necessary for the rapid development of the national economy while lowering prices and raising wages, and ensure that these accumulations are used most rationally, so that socialist production continues to grow and improve on a highly technical basis.

　　Relying on the internal accumulation of the socialist economy and the economy system to develop the national economy, the Soviet Union has provided a brilliant example. Based on Lenin and Stalin's theory of economy, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union formulated an economic accounting system to ensure the implementation of the principle of economy, and mobilized the broad masses to fight for economy, so that the labor productivity of various departments of the national economy continued to increase and the cost of products continued to decrease. The Soviet Union's construction experience over the past 30 years has fully proved that the economy system is a powerful lever for developing socialist production.

　　Our country is currently striving to realize socialist industrialization. In order to guarantee the victorious realization of our country's socialist industrialization, the Party and the government have repeatedly called on us to practice strict economy and oppose waste. Therefore, studying Lenin and Stalin's theory of economy and the Soviet Union's experience in economy, and implementing the principle of economy in all sectors of our country's national economy, is of extremely great significance. Economy is also the fundamental way for our country's industrialization to accumulate funds.

　　In order to accumulate funds for our country's industrialization, the economy system should be implemented in many aspects of social life, but the most important thing is to rely on the internal economy of socialist enterprises. The internal accumulation of socialist enterprises is the main source of state centralized construction funds. The proportion of taxes and profits paid by state-owned enterprises and cooperatives in my country's total budget revenue accounted for 34.08% in 1950, and rose to 66.14% in 1954. Moreover, as we move forward, with the growth of socialist economic components and the socialist transformation of the national economy, this proportion will continue to increase.

　　Socialist enterprises rely on economy to increase capital accumulation, mainly starting from two aspects. On the one hand, it uses technological equipment reform, improves the labor skill level of employees, improves labor organization, consolidates labor discipline, and reduces non-production personnel to improve labor productivity and reduce the consumption of living labor in unit products. On the other hand, it uses methods such as increasing equipment utilization rate and eliminating any waste in the use of raw materials, fuels, and auxiliary materials to reduce the consumption of materialized labor in unit products. These two aspects of economy can lead to the reduction of product costs in industrial, mining, construction, transportation, and other production enterprises, and the reduction of circulation costs in commercial enterprises, increase enterprise profits, and accumulate more funds for the country. For example, according to the planned indicators for 1954, if the six central industrial ministries plus the six ministries of geology, construction engineering, railways, transportation, post and telecommunications, and forestry reduce the construction and installation cost of basic construction by only 1%, they can save the country 28 million yuan per year; if the production cost of central and local state-owned industries is reduced by only 1%, they can save the country 84 million yuan per year.

　　In recent years, the product costs of state-owned enterprises in our country have been continuously reduced. However, compared with the advanced indicators of the Soviet Union, the labor organization in our state-owned industrial, mining, transportation, and construction enterprises is still not rational enough. For example, the consumption rate of raw materials and fuels is still relatively high, the equipment utilization rate is still very low, and the commodity circulation cost in commercial enterprises is also very high. Therefore, the potential possibility for socialist enterprises in our country to accumulate funds for industrialization through the economy path is still very huge. Leading staff of state-owned enterprises must pay attention to this huge potential power within socialist enterprises in our country.

　　It must be pointed out that the reduction of product costs by socialist enterprises in our country through the economy system is fundamentally different from the reduction of production costs under the capitalist system. Under the capitalist system, reducing production costs is to accumulate profits for capitalists, and it is achieved by increasing labor intensity, lowering workers' wages, deteriorating labor conditions, and other methods that sacrifice the interests of workers, which will inevitably cause opposition from workers. In socialist enterprises in our country, not only are the methods of reducing costs completely different from those under the capitalist system, but also the purpose of economy is to increase the interests of the entire society, that is, to increase the interests of the workers themselves. Therefore, the economy system will inevitably receive enthusiastic support from all employees. As long as the leading staff of the enterprise can mobilize the masses of employees, they can rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees to achieve great results in saving expenses and reducing costs. For example, in 1953, Anshan Iron and Steel Company mobilized all employees to improve labor organization and revised the labor plan. As a result, the new plan reduced 5,889 people compared with the original plan, and labor productivity increased by 5.35%, which can save the country 5.24 million yuan in wage expenses and more than 45,000 square meters of dormitory construction investment. For another example, all employees of the Third Engineering Company of the Heilongjiang Provincial Construction Department, under correct leadership, attached importance to the work of reducing costs and established various responsibility systems. In the construction of 1954, they were able to overfulfill the cost reduction plan on the premise of ensuring quality. The funds saved accounted for 13.93% of the total project cost. Among them, saving material costs, labor costs, administrative management fees, and engineering business fees saved the country more than 1.34 million yuan.

　　Since the founding of New China, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and with the support of the broad masses of employees, our country has made great achievements in practicing economy for the development of industry. The development of socialist enterprises and the increase of internal accumulation of enterprises have made the state's financial revenue grow rapidly year by year. For example, if the total budget revenue in 1950 is taken as 100, then it was 198.91 in 1951, 269.36 in 1952, 333.82 in 1953, and 355.69 in 1954. The vast majority of these rapidly growing capital accumulations are invested in economic construction, national defense construction, and social, cultural, and educational construction according to the national plan. With the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, we have not only used these funds to build new types of heavy industrial enterprises such as seamless steel pipe plants and large rolling mills, but also hundreds of large enterprises belonging to the power industry, coal mining industry, petroleum industry, modern iron and steel industry, non-ferrous metal industry, basic chemical industry, and machinery manufacturing industry are under construction and expansion. The completion of these newly built heavy industrial enterprises and the development of my country's original industries are rapidly increasing the proportion of modern industrial output value in my country's total industrial and agricultural output value, rapidly increasing the proportion of means of production output value in the total industrial output value, and rapidly increasing the proportion of state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private industrial output value in the total industrial output value. That is to say, the preliminary foundation of my country's socialist industrialization is being rapidly established by relying on internal accumulation. This proves that the road formulated by the Party to realize my country's industrialization by relying on economy and socialist accumulation is completely correct.

　　Economy is not only an extremely important means for us to create socialist accumulation, but also an extremely important means for us to correctly use the accumulated funds. When Lenin and Stalin demonstrated the relationship between economy and socialist industrialization, they pointed out that the problem is not only to accumulate funds for industrialization from all aspects with extremely strict and economical methods, but also to use the accumulated funds reasonably with extremely strict and economical methods, so that the people's property will not be wasted, and the accumulated funds will not be dispersed, stolen, or misappropriated for unnecessary purposes, but will ensure that the funds are used to meet the most basic needs of industrial development.

　　In recent years, the Communist Party of China and the People's Government have strictly followed the principle of economy to allocate state funds, and have used the state's accumulation for the most urgently needed economic construction, national defense construction, and social, cultural, and educational construction. In order to implement the principle of strictly and economically using state construction funds, the Party has repeatedly pointed out that it is necessary to practice strict economy and oppose waste in all work, especially in production departments and basic construction work. In order to protect state funds from being stolen and wasted, the Party and the government launched the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in 1952, educating cadres and the people across the country that they must wage an irreconcilable struggle against the criminal acts of stealing state funds and wasting state funds, and against the bureaucracy that is indifferent to theft and waste.

　　Under the guidance of the Party, a new moral atmosphere of cherishing state funds and protecting socialist public property has begun to be established in our country. In the work of various departments of the national economy and all state organs, a large number of advanced figures and model examples have emerged who actively practice economy and oppose waste in the attitude of masters of the country. However, it should be pointed out that we still have serious shortcomings in both accumulating funds and using funds. In particular, in the operation and management of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and in basic construction projects, the phenomenon of not paying attention to economy and wasting funds is still extremely serious.

　　Premier Zhou pointed out in his government work report at the First Session of the First National People's Congress that one of the important problems in my country's industrial construction "is the huge waste caused by the fact that many departments and enterprises do not pay attention to saving funds and do not pay attention to managing financial costs." In the management work of our state-owned industry, the remnants of the supply system have not been completely eliminated, and some leading cadres of enterprises still lack the view of practicing strict economy to accumulate funds for national industrialization. They do not pay attention to economic accounting and neglect labor, cost, and financial work. Many enterprises have unreasonable labor organizations, bloated institutions, too many non-production personnel, a large waste of labor, a very low equipment utilization rate, conservatively set raw material consumption quotas, too many miscellaneous expenses, and cannot fully complete the four plans of total output value, labor productivity, cost, and profit stipulated by the state, so that the huge possibility of relying on economy to accumulate industrialization funds within our socialist enterprises has not been fully utilized. For example, among the enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, only 63% of the enterprises fully completed the four plans stipulated by the state in 1954, and 37% of the enterprises did not fully complete the plans.

　　The investment in basic construction is the main expenditure of the state's centralized accumulation of funds. In our national budget, the vast majority of total expenditure is used for basic construction projects in the national economy, culture, and education. However, it is precisely in this important aspect of state investment that there is a serious waste phenomenon. Some productive basic constructions, such as newly built and expanded factories, mines, and railways, often experience phenomena such as work stoppages waiting for drawings, waiting for materials, rework in the middle, abandoned work, and poor engineering quality due to blind construction without following the planned procedures, forming a huge waste of state funds. In non-productive basic construction, such as the construction of office buildings, dormitories, and schools, there is a serious erroneous tendency to not pay attention to the economic principles of construction. Many units do not abide by the construction principles of "applicability, economy, and attention to aesthetics when possible" instructed by the Party and the government, but are greedy for size, greedy for quantity, disregarding economic effects, and blindly pursuing luxury, wasting a lot of funds that could have been used to expand industrial construction. In this regard, newspapers have already exposed many shocking examples. For example, the former Southwest Military and Political Committee imitated the classical architectural forms of the "Temple of Heaven" and "Tiananmen Square" in Beijing, and completed a luxurious auditorium with a capacity of 4,500 people and several ancillary buildings in March 1954. The entire construction took two years and six months, with continuous rework in the middle and seven additional budgets, but the use after completion was not great, and the attached guest house averaged less than five guests per day. In addition, the cost of only the three buildings of Changchun "Geological Palace", Harbin Medical University, and Anshan Design Building exceeded the national standard by more than 7 million yuan. With this money, more than 90,000 square meters of dormitories with a cost of 80 yuan per square meter could be built.

　　In addition to industry and basic construction projects, the waste phenomenon in other departments of the national economy is also serious.

　　This phenomenon of not paying attention to economy, not paying attention to accumulating funds, and "generously" wasting industrialization funds is intolerable and should be corrected. It must be remembered that the economy within enterprises, whether it is the economy of living labor or materialized labor, is to improve social labor productivity, and the improvement of labor productivity, according to Lenin, is ultimately the most important condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system. It can be seen that economy is an important condition for the socialist economic system to defeat the capitalist economic system. We must use whether we earnestly practice economy and oppose waste as a criterion for assessing whether our national economic workers are loyal to our country's socialist construction cause.

　　Our country's planned economic construction has entered its third year. The recently held National Congress of the Communist Party of China has discussed and approved the draft of my country's first Five-Year Plan. This plan is a major step in realizing the Party's general line during the transition period. The resolution of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the draft of the first Five-Year Plan called on: "All comrades of the Party must, under the leadership of the Central Committee, unite the masses of people of all ethnic groups across the country, work diligently, overcome difficulties, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to complete and overfulfill this plan." Yes, all economic workers in state-owned enterprises and construction units must sincerely implement this great call of the Party in their actual work, must consolidate the economic accounting system, launch an economy movement among all employees, establish a strict economy system, strive to reduce costs, increase the accumulation of state funds, eliminate waste, and strive to comprehensively complete and strive to overfulfill the state's plan.

    为了实现五年计划必须厉行节约
　　蒋学模
    社会上各种各样的节约，归根到底是为了节省工作时间，即节省活劳动和物化劳动。节省活劳动，这就是要求减少每项工作和单位产品中工作人员的劳动耗费。节省物化劳动，就是要求减少每项工作和单位产品中物质资料的耗费。所以，节约制度就是要求最合理地利用人力、物力和财力，以最少的劳动耗费和物质耗费取得最好的效果。
    建立严格的节约制度的必要，是由社会主义经济制度本身和社会主义基本经济规律的客观要求决定的。社会主义制度消灭了人对人的剥削的一切形式，最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要便成为社会主义生产的目的。因而，国民经济的发展，决不能用资本主义经常使用的那种剥削国内人民和掠夺其它国家人民的方法来积累资金，而只能依靠内部积累的方法来积累资金，这样，节约便是增加社会主义经济的内部积累和正确利用积累极重要的手段。只有在国民经济的一切部门建立起严格的节约制度，精打细算地减少每项工作和单位产品中的劳动耗费和物质耗费，才能在降低物价、提高工资的同时，积累起迅速发展国民经济所必需的巨额资金，并保证这些积累得到最合理的使用，使社会主义生产在高度技术基础上不断增长和不断完善。
    依靠社会主义经济的内部积累，依靠节约制度来发展国民经济，苏联已提供了光辉的范例。苏联共产党根据列宁和斯大林关于节约的理论，制定出保证贯彻节约原则的经济核算制，动员广大群众为节约而斗争，使国民经济各部门的劳动生产率不断提高，产品成本不断降低。苏联三十多年来的建设经验，完全证明了节约制度是发展社会主义生产的强大杠杆。
    我国目前正在为实现社会主义工业化而奋斗。为了保证我国社会主义工业化的胜利实现，党和政府一再号召我们必须厉行节约、反对浪费。因此，学习列宁、斯大林关于节约的理论和苏联的节约经验，在我国国民经济的一切部门贯彻节约原则，是有着极其重大意义的。节约，同样是我国工业化积累资金的根本道路。
    为了积累我国工业化的资金，节约的制度应该贯彻到社会生活的许多方面，但最主要的是要依靠社会主义企业内部的节约。社会主义企业内部的积累，是国家集中建设资金的主要来源。国营企业和合作社缴纳的税款和利润在我国预算总收入中所占的比重，一九五○年占百分之三十四点零八，一九五四年已上升到占百分之六十六点一四。而且愈往前去，随着我国社会主义经济成分的增长和国民经济的社会主义改造，这一比重还将不断增加。
    社会主义企业依靠节约来增加资金积累，主要从两方面着手。一方面，是用革新技术装备、提高职工的劳动熟练程度、改善劳动组织、巩固劳动纪律和减少非生产人员等办法来提高劳动生产率，减少单位产品中活劳动的耗费。另一方面，是用提高设备利用率、消灭原料、燃料、辅助材料使用上的任何浪费等办法，来减少单位产品中物化劳动的耗费。这两方面的节约，就能导致工矿、建筑、运输等生产企业中产品成本的降低和商业企业中流通费用的减少，增加企业的赢利，为国家积累更多的资金。例如，按一九五四年的计划指标计算，单是中央的六个工业部加上地质、建筑工程、铁道、交通、邮电、林业六个部，只要降低基本建设的建筑安装成本的百分之一，就可以每年为国家节约二千八百万元；中央和地方的国营工业的生产成本只要降低百分之一，就可以每年为国家节约八千四百万元。
    几年来，我国国营企业的产品成本是不断降低的。但是同苏联的先进指标比较起来，我们国营工、矿、运输、建筑企业中的劳动组织还是不够合理的。例如，原材料和燃料的耗费率还比较高，设备利用率还很低，商业企业中的商品流通费用也很高。因此，我国社会主义企业通过节约的道路来为工业化积累资金的潜在可能性仍是非常巨大的。国营企业的领导工作人员，必须重视我国社会主义企业内部这种巨大的潜在力量。
    必须指出，我国社会主义企业通过节约制度来降低产品成本，同资本主义制度下降低生产成本是根本不同的。资本主义制度下降低生产成本，是为资本家积累利润，是依靠提高劳动强度、降低工人工资、恶化劳动条件等等牺牲劳动者利益的办法来达到的，因此必然会引起劳动者的反对。在我国的社会主义企业里，不仅降低成本的方法同资本主义制度下完全不同，而且节约的目的是为了增进全社会的利益，也就是增进劳动者自己的利益，因此节约制度必然会得到全体职工的热烈支持。只要企业领导工作人员能把职工群众发动起来，就能够依靠着广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，在节省开支、降低成本方面取得巨大的成绩。例如：鞍山钢铁公司一九五三年发动全体职工改善劳动组织，修订了劳动计划，结果就使新计划比原计划减少了五千八百八十九人，劳动生产率提高了百分之五点三五，可为国家节省工资开支五百二十四万元和四万五千多平方公尺的宿舍建设投资。又如，黑龙江省建设厅第三工程公司全体职工，在正确领导下，重视了降低成本的工作，建立了各项责任制度，在一九五四年度的施工中就能在保证质量的前提下，超额完成了降低成本计划，节约的资金占工程总造价的百分之一三点九三。其中节约材料费、人工费、行政管理费和工程业务费方面为国家节省了一百三十四万多元。
    新中国成立以来，在党和政府的正确领导下，依靠广大职工群众的支持，我国在为发展工业而厉行节约这方面已取得很大的成就。社会主义企业的发展和企业内部积累的增加，使国家的财政收入逐年迅速增长。如以一九五○年的预算总收入作为一百，则一九五一年为一九八点九一，一九五二年为二六九点三六，一九五三年为三三三点八二，一九五四年为三五五点六九。这样逐年迅速增长的资金积累，绝大部分是按照国家计划投到经济建设、国防建设和社会文化教育建设方面去的。在苏联的无私援助下，我们不仅用这些资金建成了像无缝钢管厂和大型轧钢厂等这一类新型的重工业企业，而且，正在新建扩建过程中的，还有几百个属于电力工业、煤矿工业、石油工业、现代化钢铁工业、有色金属工业、基本化学工业和机械制造工业的大企业。这些新建的重工业企业的建成和我国原有工业的发展，正使现代工业的产值在我国工农业总产值中的比重迅速上升，使生产资料的产值在工业总产值中的比重迅速上升，使国营、合作社营和公私合营工业的产值在工业总产值中的比重迅速上升。这就是说，我国社会主义工业化的初步基础，正在依靠内部积累而迅速建立起来。这就证明，党所制定的依靠节约、依靠社会主义积累来实现我国工业化的道路，是完全正确的。
    节约不仅是我们创造社会主义积累的极重要的手段，而且也是我们正确地利用积累起来的资金的极重要的手段。列宁和斯大林在论证节约和社会主义工业化的关系时曾经指出，问题不仅在于要用极严格节省的办法从各方面来积累工业化的资金，而且必须以极严格节省的办法来合理地使用积累起来的资金，使人民的财产一个钱也不白白浪费，使积累起来的资金不被分散，不被盗窃，不被挪用于不必要的用途，而保证将资金用来满足发展工业的最基本的需要。
    几年来，中国共产党和人民政府严格按照节约原则来支配国家的资金，将国家的积累用于最迫切需要的经济建设、国防建设和社会文化教育建设各方面。为了贯彻严格地节省使用国家建设资金的原则，党一再指出，必须在一切工作中，特别是在生产部门中和基本建设工作中厉行节约，反对浪费。为了保障国家资金不被窃盗和浪费，党和政府在一九五二年发动了“三反”和“五反”运动，教育全国干部和人民群众必须同窃盗国家资金、浪费国家资金的罪恶行为和对窃盗行为及浪费现象漠不关心的官僚主义展开不调和的斗争。
    在党的教导下，珍惜国家资金、爱护社会主义公共财产的新的道德风气已开始在我国树立起来。在国民经济各部门和一切国家机关工作中，都涌现了大量以国家主人翁的态度来积极厉行节约、反对浪费的先进人物和模范事例。但是，应该指出，我们不论是在积累资金或使用资金方面，都还存在着严重的缺点。特别是在国营工矿企业的经营管理方面和基本建设工程方面，不重视节约、浪费资金的现象还是极其严重的。
    周总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的政府工作报告中指出，我国工业建设的重要问题之一，“是由于许多部门和企业不重视节约资金、不重视管理财务成本而形成的巨大的浪费。”在我们国营工业的管理工作中，供给制的思想残余还没有被完全肃清，企业的一部分领导干部还缺乏厉行节约为国家工业化积累资金的观点，他们不重视经济核算，忽视劳动、成本和财务工作。许多企业的劳动组织不合理，机构臃肿，非生产人员过多，劳动力大量浪费，设备利用率很低，原材料消耗定额订得保守，杂费太多，不能全面完成国家规定的总产值、劳动生产率、成本和利润四项计划，以致我们社会主义企业内部依靠节约来积累工业化资金的巨大可能性还没有被充分发挥出来。例如，在重工业部所属的企业中，一九五四年全面完成国家所规定的四项计划的企业只有百分之六十三，还有百分之三十七的企业没有全面完成计划。
    基本建设方面的投资，是国家集中积累的资金的主要支出。在我们的国家预算中，总支出的极大部分是用于国民经济和文化教育的基本建设工程方面的。但恰巧在国家投资的这一个重要方面，却有严重的浪费现象。某些生产性的基本建设，如工厂、矿山、铁路等新建扩建工程，由于不按照计划程序盲目施工，经常发生停工待图、待料、中途返工、废工、工程质量低劣等现象，形成国家资金的巨大浪费。在非生产性的基本建设方面，如修建办公楼、宿舍、学校等工程中，则严重地发生不重视建筑的经济原则的错误倾向。许多单位不遵守党和政府所指示的“适用、经济并在可能条件下注意美观”的建筑原则，而是贪大、贪多、不顾经济效果、一味讲究富丽堂皇，浪费了许多本来可以用于扩大工业建设的资金。在这方面，报纸上已经揭发了许多惊人的例子。例如，原西南军政委员会仿照北京“天坛”、“天安门”古典的建筑形式，在一九五四年三月修成了一座可容纳四千五百人的豪华的大礼堂以及若干附属建筑。整个建筑经历了两年六个月的时间，中途不断返工，七次追加预算，但建成后的用处却不大，其附设的招待所平均每日住不到五个客人。此外，仅长春“地质宫”、哈尔滨医科大学、鞍山设计大楼三个建筑物的造价，就超过国家标准七百多万元，用这笔钱可以盖八十元一平方公尺的宿舍九万多平方公尺。
    除了工业和基本建设工程以外，国民经济其它部门中的浪费现象也是严重的。
    这种不重视节约，不重视积累资金和“慷慨”地浪费工业化资金的现象，是不能容忍的，是应该纠正的。必须记住，企业内部的节约，不论是活劳动和物化劳动的节约，都是为了提高社会劳动生产率，而劳动生产率的提高，按照列宁的说法，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最主要的条件。由此可见，节约是社会主义经济制度战胜资本主义经济制度的重要条件，我们必须以是否切实厉行节约、反对浪费，作为考核我们国家经济工作人员是否忠心于我国的社会主义建设事业的一个标准。
    我国有计划的经济建设已经进到了第三个年头。最近举行的中国共产党全国代表会议已讨论和通过了我国的第一个五年计划草案。这个计划是实现党在过渡时期总路线的一个重大步骤。中国共产党全国代表会议关于第一个五年计划草案的决议中号召：“全党同志必须在中央的领导下，团结全国各族人民群众，兢兢业业，克服困难，努力增产，厉行节约，为完成和超额完成这个计划而奋斗。”是的，一切国营企业和建设单位中的经济工作人员，必须诚诚恳恳地在实际工作中来贯彻党的这一伟大号召，必须巩固经济核算制，发动全体职工开展节约运动，建立严格的节约制度，力求降低成本，增加国家资金的积累，消灭浪费，为全面地完成和争取超额完成国家的计划而斗争。
