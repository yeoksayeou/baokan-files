Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 9th: According to TASS, Soviet Marshal Konev delivered a report on May 8th at the Moscow celebration meeting for the Victory Day over Germany.

　　Konev said: Ten years ago, the armed forces of the Soviet state and the troops of the anti-Hitler alliance—France, Britain, and the United States—fought side by side, defeated the fascist aggressors, and achieved a victory of epoch-making significance. This victory is of great significance to all progressive humanity. For the Soviet people, defeating fascist Germany meant that our country was freed from the threat of fascist aggression, that the great achievements of the October Socialist Revolution were preserved, and that the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system was once again shown to the world.

　　From a military point of view, this victory convincingly proved the superiority of our armed forces, the combat effectiveness of our personnel, our armaments, and our strategies and tactics over the then most powerful capitalist army—the army of fascist Germany.

　　Konev recounted in detail the great feats of the Soviet people and army in the Second World War. Konev said: The achievements of the Soviet army and the victory of the Soviet Union are primarily explained by the superiority of our socialist social system and state system.

　　The unbreakable alliance of the working class and the collective farmers, the friendship of the peoples of our multi-ethnic country, the spiritual and political unity of Soviet men and women, their irreconcilable hatred for the enemy and their love for their motherland, this is the inexhaustible source of strength of the Soviet state.

　　Our Party and government established a highly developed heavy industry during several Five-Year Plans, which is the economic foundation of our country's national defense strength, and it played a brilliant role in winning victory over the enemy in the Patriotic War. The war proved that heavy industry was, is, and will be the cornerstone of the indestructible strength of our country and its armed forces.

　　Konev emphasized that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was the organizer and inspirer of the Soviet people's struggle against the fascist aggressors. In the Patriotic War, under the leadership of their own Communist Party, the Soviet people did not waver in the face of the most severe tests and demonstrated a steel-like will, shouldered the entire burden of the war and brought the war to a victorious conclusion.

　　Konev then spoke about the post-war international situation. He said that the main result of the Second World War has been the fundamental change in the international situation in favor of democracy and socialism. The world has been divided into two camps. Parallel to the world capitalist camp, a powerful world socialist and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, uniting twelve countries with a population of 900 million, has emerged.

　　However, the desire to strive for peace, cooperation and the establishment of normal relations among all countries is hindered by the policies of the imperialist countries aimed at preparing for another world war. Regrettably, ten years after the end of the war, Germany is still divided and a peace treaty has not yet been concluded. The North Atlantic Group has aggravated international tensions and caused unease among all progressive humanity. The Paris Accords are a serious threat to the peace and security of European countries.

　　Konev said: The Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have always consistently and unswervingly pursued a policy of striving for peace and friendship among nations, but at the same time they must heighten their vigilance and take the necessary measures to unite their efforts in order to avoid any emergencies and provocations, and prevent the possibility of sudden aggression from any direction.

　　Konev said: In the post-war years, the Soviet army, organized in accordance with the principles of modernization, has become an even more powerful force. It has been educated on the basis of advanced military science and the experience of the Great Patriotic War, and it conducts its combat and tactical training in accordance with the nature of modern warfare, taking due account of new means of combat.

　　The lofty moral and combat qualities of the Soviet Army and Navy, their selfless loyalty to the Motherland, the Communist Party, and the Soviet government, guarantee that any task the Party and government may set in the future to defend the national interests of the Soviet Motherland will be gloriously completed.

　　科涅夫元帅在莫斯科庆祝大会上作报告
    新华社九日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联元帅科涅夫八日在莫斯科举行的对德胜利日庆祝大会上作了报告。
    科涅夫说：十年前，苏维埃国家的武装部队和反希特勒同盟——法国、英国和美国——的部队并肩作战，击溃了法西斯侵略者，取得了划时代的胜利。这个胜利对所有进步人类来说都是具有重大意义的。对苏联人民来说，战胜法西斯德国意味着我们的国家摆脱了法西斯侵略的威胁，意味着保住十月社会主义革命的伟大成果，并且意味着再一次向全世界显示了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性。
    从军事上来说，这个胜利令人信服地证明了我们的武装部队、人员的战斗力、军备以及我们的战略战术对当时最强大的资本主义军队——法西斯德国的军队的优越性。
    科涅夫详细地追述了苏联人民和军队在第二次世界大战中的伟大功勋。科涅夫说：苏联军队的成就和苏联的胜利首先要由我们社会主义的社会制度和国家制度的优越性来解释。
    工人阶级和集体农民的牢不可破的联盟，我们的多民族国家的各族人民的友谊，苏维埃男女的精神上和政治上的团结一致，他们对于敌人的不共戴天的仇恨和对于他们的祖国的热爱，这就是苏维埃国家的力量的取之不尽的源泉。
    我们的党和政府在几个五年计划期间建立了高度发展的重工业，这是我们国家国防力量的经济基础，它在卫国战争的在赢得对敌人的胜利方面起了光辉的作用。战争证明，重工业过去是，现在是，将来还是我们国家的和它的武装部队的不可摧毁的力量的基石。
    科涅夫强调指出：苏联共产党是苏联人民对法西斯侵略者的斗争中的组织者和鼓舞者。在卫国战争中，苏联人民在他们自己的共产党的领导下，在最严重的考验面前没有动摇而且表现了钢铁般的意志，担当了战争的全部重担并使战争胜利结束。
    科涅夫接着谈到了战后的国际局势。他说，第二次世界大战的主要结果就是国际局势发生了有利于民主和社会主义的根本变化。世界已经分裂为两个阵营。同世界资本主义阵营平行，已经出现了一个以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的、团结着拥有九亿人口的十二个国家的强大的世界社会主义和民主阵营。
    但是，争取一切国家之间的和平、合作和建立正常关系的愿望，受到帝国主义国家的目的在于准备另一次世界战争的政策的阻挠。令人遗憾的是，战争结束十年以后的今天，德国仍然是分裂的，而且还没有缔结和约。北大西洋集团加剧了国际紧张局势，并引起了全体进步人类的不安。巴黎协定是对欧洲国家的和平和安全的严重威胁。
    科涅夫说：苏联和人民民主国家始终一贯地和坚持不渝地奉行着争取和平和各国间的友好的政策，但是它们同时必须提高警惕，并采取联合它们的努力的必要措施，以便避免任何的紧急事件和挑衅，防止遭受来自任何方面的突然侵略的可能。
    科涅夫说：在战后的年代中，按照现代化的方针组织起来的苏联军队已变成一支更强大的力量。它是在先进的军事科学和伟大的卫国战争中的经验的基础上受教育的，它是在适当考虑到新的斗争手段的情况下，按照现代战争的性质进行它的战斗和战术训练的。
    苏联陆军和海军的崇高道德和战斗品质，他们对祖国、共产党和苏联政府的忘我的忠诚，保证党和政府将来在保卫苏维埃祖国的国家利益方面的任何任务将会光荣地完成。
