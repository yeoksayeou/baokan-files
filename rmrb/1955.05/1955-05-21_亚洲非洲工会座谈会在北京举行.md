Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: The Asian-African Trade Union Conference was held in Beijing on May 18th and 19th, with the participation of 213 delegates from 71 trade union organizations in fifteen countries.

The Asian-African Trade Union Conference was held upon the joint suggestion of the Japanese Workers' Delegation to China, the Indian Trade Unions' May Day Celebration Delegation to China, and the Indonesian Trade Unions' May Day Celebration Delegation to China, with the unanimous agreement of the heads of delegations of Asian and African countries. The Sudanese trade union representative, who had returned home due to prior commitments, entrusted other representatives to read his speech at the symposium on his behalf. Representatives from the Japanese civil engineering and construction, steel, and public employees' unions, who arrived in Beijing after the heads of delegations meeting, also attended the symposium.

This symposium, held in an atmosphere of friendship, harmony, and freedom, was attended by more than 200 representatives from 71 influential trade union organizations in 15 Asian and African countries. It vividly demonstrated the growing friendship and unity of the working classes of Asian and African countries and greatly promoted this unity. Delegates pointed out in their speeches that this symposium was an unprecedented grand gathering of Asian and African trade union representatives.

B.K. Mukherjee, the Indian trade union representative, delivered the opening speech at the meeting. Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a welcome speech. Eighteen trade union representatives spoke at the meeting, representing the 68 trade union organizations present. These speeches expressed the common aspirations of the working classes of Asia and Africa: to defend peace and oppose wars of aggression; to advocate for and defend national independence, and oppose colonialism; to demand the prohibition of the manufacture, stockpiling, and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and to advocate the peaceful use of atomic energy for the benefit of mankind; and to demand the strengthening of international friendship and solidarity among the working classes of Asian and African countries. Minoru Takano, the Japanese trade union representative, delivered the closing speech, expressing his firm belief that these common aspirations would become the goals of mass movements carried out by trade union organizations in various countries.

In their speeches, the various trade union representatives particularly emphasized the need to defend peace and oppose wars of aggression. They unanimously pointed out that peace is the only path to a happy life, and peace is the fundamental condition for carrying out the struggle to improve the lives of the working class. Anyone who disrupts peace and provokes war is a common enemy of mankind. Trade union representatives from Iran, Syria, and Lebanon particularly condemned imperialism for forcing these countries to join military blocs and establish military bases in these countries. The representatives unanimously supported the Asian-African Conference and the resolutions and declarations it adopted, believing that the Asian-African Conference reflected the profound historical changes taking place in Asia and Africa and was a symbol of the demand for peace and unity among Asian and African countries. The representatives supported peaceful coexistence among all countries, pointing out that the unity of the international working class is a guarantee for maintaining peace. They all expressed their willingness to strengthen the friendly unity of the people and working classes of Asian and African countries in the struggle to defend peace.

The representatives believed that atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs have increased the threat of war, and the use of such weapons is cruel and inhumane. The appeal from the Japanese trade union representative from Hiroshima regarding the tenth anniversary commemoration of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1955, received the deep sympathy and support of trade union representatives from various countries. The Indian trade union representative advocated that countries should destroy existing atomic and hydrogen weapons through the enactment of international law and prohibit their use and continued manufacture. Trade union representatives from various countries unanimously advocated the prohibition of the manufacture, stockpiling, and use of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and advocated the peaceful use of atomic energy for the benefit of mankind.

In their speeches, the representatives pointed out that Asia and Africa are the cradles of ancient civilization, the cradles of human thought and various religious beliefs. Asia and Africa have abundant resources, and the people of Asia and Africa have suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, and are therefore economically and culturally backward. Trade union representatives from the Middle East and Africa cited specific facts to condemn the plunder of imperialism, condemning imperialism for causing these countries to be backward, causing the collapse of national industry and commerce, mass unemployment, and serious poverty, and depriving citizens and trade unions of their rights. The representatives reiterated their support for the Asian-African Conference's resolution against colonialism, advocating the right to national self-determination, and believing that ending colonialism is an important condition for establishing lasting peace.

Trade union representatives from various countries welcomed the holding of the Asian-African Trade Union Conference, believing that the Asian-African Trade Union Friendship Gathering held in Beijing on May 2 and this symposium have enhanced the friendship, solidarity, and mutual understanding of the working classes of Asian and African countries, and put forward suggestions for further enhancing this friendship, solidarity, and understanding. These suggestions included: Asian and African trade unions exchanging trade union information, introducing each other's workers' lives and work conditions, exchanging trade union work experience, and exchanging trade union delegations for friendly visits. The suggestion put forward jointly by the Indonesian trade union delegations to consider holding an Asian-African trade union conference was supported by trade union representatives from many countries. Some trade union representatives suggested that trade union representatives from various countries take this suggestion back and have it considered by their respective trade union organizations.

Chinese trade union representatives made two speeches at the meeting, pointing out that although trade unions in Asian and African countries represent different countries, have different histories, different religious beliefs, and political views, workers in Asian and African countries have more in common. The Chinese trade union has always advocated mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual consultation, to achieve unity by seeking common ground while reserving differences. Although the representatives at the meeting spoke with different "bass, alto, and treble" tones, as long as the "bass, alto, and treble" sing together in unison, they form a harmonious and loud sound wave. Although this symposium does not write resolutions, there is indeed a common and consistent desire among the representatives of various countries, and it is firmly believed that everyone will work hard to achieve these common desires.

The Asian-African Trade Union Conference held four meetings in two days and concluded successfully on the evening of the 19th.

　　亚洲非洲工会座谈会在北京举行
    新华社二十日讯　亚洲非洲工会座谈会在十五个国家七十一个工会组织的二百一十三名代表的参加下，于五月十八日和十九日在北京举行。
    亚洲非洲工会座谈会是在日本工人访华代表团、印度各工会五一节来华观礼代表团和印度尼西亚各工会五一节来华观礼代表团的共同建议下，经亚洲非洲各国工会代表团团长会议一致同意举行的。先期因事返国的苏丹工会代表委托其他代表代为在座谈会上宣读了他的发言。在团长会议举行后到达北京的日本土木建筑、钢铁和公务员等工会的代表也出席了这次座谈会。
    这次在友好、融洽和毫无约束的空气中举行的座谈会，有亚非十五国七十一个有影响的工会组织的二百多位代表参加，生动地表现了亚非各国工人阶级日益增强的友好团结，并大大地促进了这种团结。代表们在发言中指出，这次座谈会是从来没有过的亚非工会代表盛大的集会。
    印度工会代表比·库·慕克吉在会上致开会词。中华全国总工会主席赖若愚致欢迎词。十八个工会代表在会上发言，他们代表了出席会议的六十八个工会组织。这些发言表达了亚非工人阶级的共同愿望，这就是：要求保卫和平、反对侵略战争；主张争取和保卫民族独立，反对殖民主义；要求禁止制造、储存和使用原子武器和氢武器，主张和平利用原子能以造福于人类；要求加强亚非各国工人阶级的国际友好团结。日本工会代表高野实致闭幕词，表示深信这些共同愿望将成为各国工会组织开展群众性运动的目标。
    各个工会代表在发言中都特别强调必须保卫和平、反对侵略战争。他们一致指出和平是走向幸福生活的唯一道路，和平是进行争取改善工人阶级生活的斗争的基本条件，任何扰乱和平挑起战争的都是人类的公敌。伊朗、叙利亚和黎巴嫩的工会代表特别谴责帝国主义迫使这些国家参加军事集团和在这些国家建立军事基地。代表们一致拥护亚非会议及其通过的决议和宣言，认为亚非会议反映了亚非两洲发生的深刻历史变化，它是亚非各国要求和平和团结的象征。代表们支持一切国家的和平共处，指出国际工人阶级的团结是维护和平的保障。他们都表示愿加强亚非各国人民和工人阶级在保卫和平斗争中的友好团结。
    代表们认为原子弹和氢弹增加了战争威胁，使用这一类武器是残忍和不人道的。来自广岛的日本工会代表关于在一九五五年八月六日举行广岛遭受原子弹轰炸十周年纪念的呼吁，获得各国工会代表的深切同情和支持。印度工会代表主张各国应通过颁布国际法，来销毁现有的原子武器和氢武器，禁止其使用和继续制造。各国工会代表一致主张禁止制造、储存和使用原子弹和氢弹，主张和平利用原子能以造福于人类。
    代表们在发言中指出，亚非两洲是古老文明的摇篮，是人类思潮和各种宗教信仰的摇篮，亚非两洲有富饶的资源，亚非人民曾同受帝国主义的压迫和剥削，因而在经济上和文化上处于落后状态。中近东和非洲国家的工会代表引述具体事实，谴责帝国主义的掠夺，谴责帝国主义造成这些国家的落后，造成民族工商业的倒闭、大量失业和严重贫困，使公民权利和工会权利被剥夺。代表们重申支持亚非会议反对殖民主义的决议，主张民族自决权利，认为结束殖民主义是建立持久和平的重要条件。
    各国工会代表们欢迎亚洲非洲工会座谈会的举行，认为通过五月二日在北京举行的亚非工会代表联欢会和这次座谈，已使亚非各国工人阶级的友好团结和相互了解有了增进，并提出进一步增进这种友好团结和了解的建议。这些建议中包括：亚非各国工会交换工会资料，相互介绍工人生活和劳动情况，交流工会工作经验，互派工会代表团作友谊访问。印度尼西亚各工会代表团联合提出的考虑举行亚非工会代表会议的建议，得到了许多国家的工会代表的支持。有的工会代表主张各国工会代表把这一建议带回去，由各个工会组织加以考虑。
    中国工会代表在会上作了两次发言，指出亚非各国工会虽然代表不同的国家，有不同的历史、不同的宗教信仰和政治主张，但是亚非国家的工人有着更多的相同点。中国工会一向主张相互尊重、相互了解、相互协商，以求同存异的方法取得团结。代表们在会上发言虽有低音、中音和高音的不同，但“低音、中音和高音”只要齐声同唱，就组成了和谐的宏亮的声浪。这次座谈会虽然不写决议，可是各国代表之间确实有共同一致的愿望，深信大家都会为实现这些共同愿望而努力。
