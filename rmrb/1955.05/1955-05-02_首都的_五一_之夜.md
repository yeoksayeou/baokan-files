Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch – The "May Day" night in the capital is becoming more beautiful and joyous year by year. As dusk had not yet fallen, people poured out of the streets and alleys, all heading towards East and West Chang'an Avenue. Tiananmen Square, decorated with lights, and the tall buildings surrounding the square, were as crystal clear and magnificent as palaces, attracting hundreds of thousands of revelers.

　　Workers from many factories formed dance circles in the center of Tiananmen Square. Workers from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory played dance music like "Carnival Dance" and "Hungarian Three-Person Dance," singing to their hearts' content, celebrating their successful completion of the assembly task of trial-producing China's first "Stalin No. 6 Combine Harvester." When they danced the "Invitation Dance," soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, workers from the North China Directly Subordinate Metal Structure Factory, and Young Pioneers from Beijing No. 14 Middle School came to dance with them.

　　Builders from the frontier of the motherland also came to the capital today to celebrate the festival with the people of Beijing. Li Wenyan, Zhang Tianxiang, Lu Chao, and other road-building heroes who participated in the Kangzang Highway construction were pulled into the dance circles by students from the Central Institute for Nationalities. Tibetan students were particularly grateful for their selfless labor in building the Kangzang Highway, repeatedly embracing these heroes who had experienced countless hardships. Tibetan students Xiao Yangqing and Ciren Cuomu expressed their sincere gratitude to them for bringing a happy life to the Tibetan people.

　　Several Taiwanese youths who recently returned to the motherland to study and students from the "Pick Class" of Beijing No. 25 Middle School were dancing with great interest. A burst of applause suddenly rang out from the crowd inside and outside the dance circle. Six People's Liberation Army soldiers who participated in the liberation of Yijiangshan Island and the reconnaissance of Jinmen Island by sea came to them. The Taiwanese youths shook hands with them warmly, hoping that they would liberate their hometown—Taiwan, the territory of the motherland—as soon as possible. At the invitation of the students, Lan Honggui, who had crossed the sea eight times to reconnoiter the enemy-occupied islands along the coast, and Kong Xiangyi, who had destroyed the last bunker on Yijiangshan Island, vividly recounted their combat exploits. The students of the "Pick Class" also pinned their class badges on the chests of the soldiers.

　　People reveled to their heart's content. The loudspeakers on the tree-lined avenues continuously broadcast various beautiful and melodious dance music. At 8:40, thousands of colorful sparks flew into the vast night sky, interwoven with countless searchlights. At this time, the revelers on Tiananmen Square sang and danced even more joyously under the beautiful night sky. Until late at night, people were still immersed in the ocean of revelry.

　　首都的“五一”之夜
    新华社一日讯　首都的“五一”之夜，一年比一年更加美丽和欢腾。当夜幕还没有降临时，从大街小巷里走出来的人们，一齐向东西长安街涌来。装饰着灯光的天安门和广场周围的高大建筑物，像宫殿般地晶莹而壮丽，吸引着十几万狂欢的人们。
    许多工厂的工人在天安门广场中心组成一个个的舞圈。北京农业机械厂的工人们奏着“狂欢舞”、“匈牙利三人舞”的舞曲尽情地歌唱，庆贺他们胜利地完成了试制我国第一部“斯大林六号联合收割机”的装配任务。当他们跳起“邀请舞”时，解放军战士、华北直属金属结构工厂的工人和北京市第十四中学的少年先锋队员都前来和他们一起舞蹈。
    祖国边疆的建设者，今天也来到首都和北京人们一起欢度佳节。参加康藏公路的筑路英雄李文炎、张天翔、路超等被中央民族学院的学生卷入到他们的舞圈里。藏族学生特别感激他们在修筑康藏公路中的忘我劳动，一再拥抱这些经历过无数艰辛的英雄，藏族学生小央青、此仁错姆亲切地感谢他们为藏族人民带来了幸福生活。
    最近才回到祖国学习的几个台湾青年和北京市第二十五中学的“皮克班”的学生们正在兴致勃勃地舞蹈，舞圈内外的人群中顿时响起了一阵掌声，参加解放一江山岛和渡海侦察金门岛的六个人民解放军战士来到了他们的面前，台湾青年和他们热烈地握手，希望他们早日解放自己的家乡——祖国的领土台湾。在学生们的邀请下，曾经八次渡海侦察沿海敌占岛屿的蓝洪贵和炸毁一江山岛最后一个碉堡的孔祥意生动地讲述了他们的战斗事迹。“皮克班”的学生还把他们的班徽佩戴在战士们的胸前。
    人们尽情地狂欢着。林荫大道上的扩音器，不断地放送着各种优美悦耳的舞曲。八时四十分，千万个彩色的火花，一齐飞向辽阔的夜空，同数不清的探照灯光交织在一起。这时，天安门广场上狂欢的人群，在美丽的夜幕下更加欢腾地歌舞着。一直到夜深，人们还沉浸在狂欢的海洋里。
