The Great Chinese People's Gift
Albania, A. Grasi

　　It was ten o'clock on a Monday night. On the distant sea off Durrës, a faint glimmer of lights appeared. A message came from the port office – a ship was heading towards the harbor. "Here it comes!" It was Jeman Kloss, the comrade in charge of the port, calling out. In a moment, he ordered everyone to start working as usual.

　　Before long, the Polish freighter "Pudong," carrying the first batch of gifts from the Chinese people to our people on the 10th anniversary of our liberation, arrived in Albania.

　　The port workers had been eagerly awaiting this exciting news. Their expression of love and friendship for the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, the government of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong was boundless. Our port workers were even more delighted because it was the first time since they started working in Durrës that they had seen goods from China, and the first time they had unloaded these goods with their own hands. When people thought about how these gifts had traveled tens of thousands of miles, they couldn't help but say what was in their hearts: "Thank you, free China, heroic Chinese people...!"

　　...The night gradually passed, and dawn arrived. The citizens of Durrës, on this clear spring morning, watched with envy a large freighter far from the shore. No one knew that this was the ship carrying gifts from the Chinese people, because it was still anchored in the deep sea, motionless.

　　The stevedores and transport workers convened a special but short meeting, explaining that the ship was too large to enter the port, and it would be easier to unload the cargo by barge, so a field test was necessary. This work was naturally difficult, but as long as it was clearly understood and quickly explained, the workers unanimously pledged to overcome all difficulties and strive to deliver the cargo ashore before the scheduled time. This was the vow of all the workers. ...At five o'clock this morning, three barges set off towards the Polish freighter. These three ships were the "Mostafin Madohding," the "Jeman Stafi," and the "July 10th."

　　The clear, mild harbor morning was filled with a light mist, and the fragrance of flowers was mixed in the fresh air. Colorful flags surrounded the three sea vessels, as if it were a festival. In the soaring songs of the workers, their excitement at unloading Chinese goods for the first time was revealed.

　　In this short moment from the coast to the ship, everyone's heart seemed to fly to China. "Who knows how many miles this ship has traveled to get here!" "How long did this ship's journey take?" A series of questions were exchanged among the workers, everyone wanted to know, and soon they got answers. A worker from the port office told everyone: "Comrades, listen, I'll only say two sentences, very short. This ship departed from a Chinese port more than a month ago. Understand? Please note, now I will say: It has passed through many places and oceans, such as the Indian coast, the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, the Mediterranean Sea, and came to our coast of the Adriatic Sea. Everyone thinks about how far China and our country are apart on the earth! From one continent to another, from the Far East to Albania. But, mountains and rivers cannot hinder the friendship between our two nations, two sincere friends. Our friendship has no boundaries or space."

　　"What's on the ship?" Another interesting question was raised. "This is the first batch of gifts, this ship has more than 6,500 tons of wheat and 40 tons of tin, and some other things. In a while, perhaps very soon, the rest of the gifts will also come from China. There are also two large Polish freighters that will carry sugar, rice, silk, wheat, and other things. ...Close to the "Pudong" freighter, the rushing waves shook the three barges from side to side. The leading stevedores, Lu Laiding Luo Jie and Ye Sha Wan Yisi, were the first to step onto the freighter. They embraced the Polish sailors warmly. They exchanged heartfelt words. In a moment, work began. In order to unload faster, the workers on the freighter and our workers started a competition.

　　In the afternoon, a large crowd gathered on the docks of Durrës. The sea vessel "Mostafin Madohding," fully loaded with goods, was parked in front of the people. The workers used large sacks to pack the wheat bag by bag, and the huge crane raised its head, the first bag was lifted into the air and placed on a truck.

　　Everyone was thinking when they saw this wheat: Where was it sown, where did it grow, where was it harvested? The Chinese people, liberated from the tyranny of the twentieth century, are building their own free life and extending a helping hand to help our people. So much wheat and other goods, these things were all produced by the Chinese people with their own hands on their fertile land. The Chinese people work selflessly for a new life and build socialism. Their help to our people will inevitably lead our people to a happy and prosperous path. Therefore, every working people in our country says this sentence from their hearts: "Thank you, great China."

### 伟大的中国人民的礼物

　　伟大的中国人民的礼物
　　阿尔巴尼亚　阿·格拉西
    星期一夜晚，时间已经是十点钟了。离都拉斯的遥远的海面上，出现了一片隐隐约约的灯光。在海港的办公室里传出了一个消息——一艘轮船向着海港的方向驶来了。“来啦！”这是海港负责同志介曼·克洛斯的召唤声。片刻间，他就命令大家马上按照惯例进行工作。
    不一会儿，那艘载货的波兰轮船“普东”号把中国人民在我国解放十周年时赠给我国人民的礼物的第一批运到阿尔巴尼亚来了。
    海港工人们老早就在等待着这个振奋人心的消息了。他们对于中国人民、中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和毛泽东主席的热爱和友谊的表现是无限的。我们的海港工人们更加高兴的是，因为他们从在都拉斯工作的那天起到现在，这还是第一次看到来自中国的物品，还是第一次地用他们的手来卸运这些物品。当人们想到这些礼物是经过了几万里路程才来到的时候，不可抑止地高兴地说出了他们的心里话：“谢谢你们，自由的中国，英雄的中国人民……！”
    ……夜，渐渐地过去，黎明来到了，轮船停泊在三浬以外的地方。都拉斯的市民们，在这个春天的明朗的早晨用羡慕的眼光注视着一艘远离海岸的大轮船。谁也不知道这是载运中国人民礼物的轮船，因为它还停泊在海心里，一动也不动。
    搬运工人们和运输工人们召集了一个特别的但是很短的会议，说明这个船因为船身很大而不能进港，如果用驳船来卸运东西会容易些，因此必须实地试验一下。这件工作自然是困难的，但只要清楚地懂得并经过了很快地解释以后，工人们都一致保证克服所有困难，争取在预定时间以前把船上的东西运到岸上来。这是所有工人们的誓言。……今天清晨五点钟，三艘驳船向着那艘波兰轮船的方向开去了。这三艘船是“摩斯达芬·马道赫定”号，“介曼·斯达菲”号和“七月十日”号。
    晴朗的、温和的海港早晨，飘浮着淡淡的薄雾，鲜花的芳香掺和在清新的空气里。各色彩旗圈绕在这三艘海船上，像过节一样。在昂扬的工人们的歌声里，表露出他们第一次卸运中国物品的兴奋。
    从海岸到轮船上的这片刻时间里，每一个人的心都像飞也似地飞到中国去了。“谁知道这个轮船经过了多少路程才来到这里啊！”“这个船的行程花了多少时间？”一系列的问题在工人们中间交谈着，每一个人都想知道这些，不一会就得到解答了。一个海港办公室的工人是这样告诉大家的：“同志们听着，我只说两句，话很短。这个船是一个多月以前从中国港口出发的。懂得吗？请注意，现在我要说：它经过了很多的地方和海洋，比如印度海岸，印度洋，红海，苏彝士运河，地中海而来到亚得里亚海我们的海岸。大家想一下，在地球上，中国和我们的国家相隔的多么远啊！从一个洲到另一个洲，从远东到阿尔巴尼亚。但是，千山万水不能阻碍我们这两个民族、这两个真诚的朋友的友谊。我们的友谊是没有边界和空间的。”
    “船上装的什么呀？”又是一个有趣的问题提出来了。“这是礼物的第一批，这艘轮船里有六千五百多吨小麦和四十吨锡，还有其他的一些东西，再过一些时候，也许会很快的，其余的礼物也要从中国来了。还有两艘波兰的大轮船将要载来糖、大米、丝绸、小麦和其他东西。……靠近“普东”号轮船了，奔腾的海浪把三艘驳船掀动得左右摇晃。领头的搬运工人卢来定·洛杰和叶沙·万一斯首先跨上了轮船。他们和波兰的海员们亲切地拥抱在一起了。他们之间交换了内心里的话。片刻间，开始工作了，为了卸运得更快，轮船上的工人们和我们的工人开展了竞赛。
      午后，在都拉斯港的码头上集中了大批的人群，满载着物品的海船“摩斯达芬·马道赫定”号停泊在人们面前，工人们用大麻袋一袋一袋地装着小麦，巨大的起重机抬起头来，第一袋被提到空中再放到卡车上。
    每一个人在看到这些小麦时都在想：它们是在何处播种，何处生长，何处收割的？从二十世纪的暴政里解放了的中国人民正在建设自己的自由生活，并且伸出了援助之手来帮助我国人民。这么多的小麦和其他物品，这些东西都是中国人民用他们的双手在他们丰饶的土地上生产出来的。中国人民为了新生活而忘我地工作，建设社会主义。他们给我国人民的帮助将必然地使我国人民走上幸福、富裕的道路。所以，我国每一个劳动人民都从他们的内心里说出这句话：“感谢伟大的中国。”（译自三月三十日阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”）
