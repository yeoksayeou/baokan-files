　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 13th: Hegedüs, the head of the government delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic, spoke at the Warsaw Conference on the afternoon of the 11th.

　　Hegedüs said that the government delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic fully agreed with the assessment of the current international situation made by Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and accepted and welcomed with great pleasure the proposals put forward by the Soviet government to ease international tensions and safeguard the peace and security of all nations.

　　Hegedüs continued that the Hungarian people saw with extreme indignation that, contrary to the desire of the countries of the peace camp to ease international tensions, the imperialist countries, headed by the ruling circles of the United States, had intensified war preparations in recent months, threatening the peace and security of the countries of the peace camp, including Hungary. Among the aggressive measures of the Western countries, the measures to revive German militarism pose the greatest danger to the peace and security of all countries. The Hungarian people, who have suffered from the scourge of German militarism for hundreds of years in history, know deeply what the remilitarization of West Germany will lead to. They know that the revival of German militarism threatens their freedom and independence, and they will take all necessary measures to prevent this danger.

　　Hegedüs continued that, according to the unanimous will of the entire Hungarian people, the Hungarian government delegation believed that the draft Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance and the draft Treaty on the Establishment of a Joint Military Command that we are discussing are completely correct, because these two draft treaties fully meet the requirements of the current international situation. The Hungarian government delegation will accept and sign these two treaties. Since this treaty is a regional agreement aimed at maintaining peace and security in Europe, and since this treaty is of a purely defensive nature, it fully complies with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. It also conforms to the principles of cooperation, independence, autonomy, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Therefore, this treaty will greatly promote the rapprochement of all peoples and deepen their cooperation. This treaty contributes to the greatest extent to the establishment of a European collective security system, which is extremely necessary in the current international situation.

　　Hegedüs emphasized that today we face the threat of aggressors with a confidence, calmness, and unity that has never been seen in Hungary's past history. If we form an alliance with the countries participating in this conference, we can and will indeed defend the freedom of our people and the independence of our motherland, which we have long failed to obtain and which are as precious to us as treasures.

　　Hegedüs concluded by saying that he could assure the countries participating in this treaty that the Hungarian people and the government of the Hungarian People's Republic would do their utmost in all respects to fully fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance.

　　匈牙利代表团团长赫格居斯讲话
    新华社华沙十三日电　匈牙利人民共和国政府代表团团长赫格居斯，十一日下午在华沙会议上讲了话。
    赫格居斯说，匈牙利人民共和国政府代表团完全同意苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁对目前国际局势所作的估计，并且以非常愉快的心情接受和欢迎苏联政府为了缓和国际紧张局势、保卫和平和各国人民的安全而提出的建议。
    赫格居斯接着说，匈牙利人民极其愤慨地看到，同和平阵营各国力图缓和国际紧张局势的意愿相反，以美国统治集团为首的帝国主义国家最近几个月来加紧了战争准备，威胁着和平和包括匈牙利在内的和平阵营各国的安全。在西方国家的侵略措施中，复活德国军国主义的措施对于各国和平和安全的危险性最大。匈牙利人民历史上几百年曾遭受到德国军国主义的灾难，因而深深知道，西德的重新军国主义化将导致什么结果。他们知道，德国军国主义的复活威胁着他们的自由和独立，他们要采取一切必要的措施来防止这种危险。
    赫格居斯接着说，根据匈牙利全体人民的一致意志，匈牙利政府代表团认为我们所讨论的友好、合作和互助条约草案，以及关于建立联合军事司令部条约草案是完全正确的，因为这两个条约草案完全符合目前国际局势的要求。匈牙利政府代表团将接受和签署这两个条约。由于这一条约是一个以维护欧洲和平和安全为目的的区域性的协定，由于这一条约是专门防御性质的，因此它完全符合联合国宪章的原则和宗旨。它也符合各国合作、独立、自主和不干涉他国内政的原则。因此，这一条约会大大促进各国人民的接近和加深他们的合作。这个条约在最大程度上有助于建立在目前国际形势中极其必要的欧洲集体安全体系。
    赫格居斯强调说，今天我们怀着匈牙利过去历史上所从来没有过的信心，镇静和团结一致地来对付侵略者的威胁。如果同参加这一会议的国家结成同盟，我们就能够而实际上也一定会保卫住我们过去长期得不到的、对我们来说犹如至宝的我国人民的自由和我们祖国的独立。
    赫格居斯最后说，我可以向参加这一条约的各国保证：匈牙利人民和匈牙利人民共和国政府一定会尽一切努力，在各方面尽力充分履行友好、合作和互助条约中所规定的义务。
