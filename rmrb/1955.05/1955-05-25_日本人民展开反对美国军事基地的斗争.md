Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 24th: People from all walks of life in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, formed the Alliance for the Return of the North Fuji Training Area. They held a meeting on the 21st and decided to go to Tokyo and other places to appeal and launch a broad national movement to demand the return of the Mount Fuji training area to Japan by the US military.

The meeting decided to hold a Peace Festival in the Mount Fuji area in early June to oppose US military bases, and to send representatives to the World Peace Conference to be held in Helsinki to appeal to representatives from all countries about the US military's occupation of the Mount Fuji training area.

At the same time, news said that the US military authorities, who had been forced to suspend target practice exercises since the 14th, were planning to continue target practice at Mount Fuji from May 25th.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese people oppose the United States' expansion of six US Air Force bases, including Kisarazu and Komaki, in the name of reducing disguised occupation fees.

Approximately 400 citizen representatives from Kisarazu City, Chiba Prefecture, went to Tokyo on the 17th to petition Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama and Labor Minister Takao Nishida, expressing their firm opposition to filling in 150,000 tsubo (one tsubo equals 3.3 square meters) of sea to extend the runway of the Kisarazu US Air Force base for use by large US military jets, and opposed demolishing houses to create military areas. Not long before this, Kisarazu residents had also petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Procurement Agency.

Residents of two cities and three villages near the Komaki US Air Force Base in Aichi Prefecture are also opposing the US military's expansion of Komaki Airport. Residents near the four US Air Force bases in Itami, Niigata, Tachikawa, and Yokota have also voiced their opposition to the expansion of the bases. Kyodo News Agency said that if the Japanese government wants to fulfill its promise to expand US military bases in the future, "then the local residents' fierce opposition to the expansion of the airport will inevitably become more and more intense," and may even "develop into a serious political problem."

Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd, Tokyo dispatch: The Left-wing Socialist Party's Diet Policy Committee decided at a meeting held on the 21st to launch a movement in the near future to oppose the United States maintaining and expanding military bases in Japan.

The meeting also decided to send investigation teams to Tachikawa, Yokota, Kisarazu, Niigata, and Komaki, where the United States plans to expand its air force bases, to conduct investigations.

The United States recently forced Japan to undertake the obligation of expanding military airfields throughout the country in the name of reducing Japan's "defense burden sharing," which has aroused the concern of the Japanese public. Japanese newspapers pointed out that the expansion of the airport is related to the United States' plan to turn Japan into a base for atomic warfare.

　　日本人民展开反对美国军事基地的斗争
    新华社二十四日讯　东京消息：日本山梨县各界人士组成的要求归还北富士演习场同盟，二十一日举行会议，决定要到东京等地进行呼吁，以展开广泛的国民运动，要求美军把富士山演习场归还日本。
    会议决定六月上旬在富士山地区举行反对美军基地的和平节，并派遣代表出席将在赫尔辛基举行的世界和平大会，向世界各国代表申诉美军占用富士山演习场的情况。
    同时，有消息说，曾从十四日起被迫暂停打靶演习的美军当局，又在打算从五月二十五日起继续在富士山打靶。
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本人民反对美国在削减变相占领费的名义下要日本扩充木更津、小牧等六个美国空军基地。
    千叶县木更津市市民代表共约四百人，十七日到东京向首相鸠山一郎和劳动相西田隆男请愿，表示坚决反对填平十五万坪（一坪等于三点三平方公尺）的海面，来延长木更津美国空军基地的跑道，供美军大型喷气机使用，并反对拆毁民房，辟作军用地区。在这以前不久，木更津市居民还曾到外务省和调达厅请愿。
    爱知县小牧美国空军基地附近的两个市和三个村庄的居民，也正在反对美军扩大小牧机场。伊丹、新潟、立川和横田四个美国空军基地附近的居民，也都发出了反对扩大基地的呼声。共同社说，如果日本政府今后想要履行扩大美军基地的保证，
  “那末当地居民猛烈反对扩大机场的呼声必然要越来越激烈”，甚至“会发展为严重的政治问题”。
    新华社二十二日讯　东京消息：左派社会党国会对策委员会在二十一日举行的会议上决定要在最近发动一个运动，反对美国在日本保持和扩大军事基地。
    会议还决定要派遣调查团到美国计划扩大空军基地的立川、横田、木更津、新潟和小牧去进行调查。
    美国最近在减少日本的“防卫分担费”的名义下迫使日本承担了扩大全国各地的军用飞机场的义务，这件事情引起了日本公众的忧虑。日本报纸指出：扩大飞机场和美国变日本为进行原子战争基地的计划有关。
