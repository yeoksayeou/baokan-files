To the Editor:

　　The Lao Shan Forest Farm in Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province, covers an area of over 100,000 mu. This forest area produces more than a hundred kinds of medicinal herbs, including Polygonum multiflorum, mountain flowers, and kudzu vines, many of which grow at the roots of trees. Their roots are two to five feet deep. Excavating these medicinal herbs will inevitably affect the growth of young trees. Therefore, the conflict between digging for herbs and protecting trees has not been resolved here. In the past, the forestry department suggested to the supply and marketing cooperatives in Quanjiao and other counties that they should not purchase Polygonum multiflorum and two other types of medicinal herbs, but because no feasible solutions were studied from the fundamental problem, the supply and marketing departments did not accept this suggestion.

　　The Lao Shan Forest Farm is under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. However, the issue of medicinal herb production in this forest farm involves three special districts in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces: Yang Zhou, Chu County, and Wu Hu. Because farmers from over twenty villages in six districts, including Wuyi, Xiangquan, and Xingdian, between Jiangpu in Jiangsu and Chu County, He County, and Quanjiao in Anhui, come here to dig for medicinal herbs, simply restricting farmers from entering the forest to dig for herbs by the forestry department will not only affect the production of medicinal herbs but is also unfeasible. In recent years, the damage to the forest farm has been severe due to the unresolved issue. For example, during the ten days from April 15th to 25th, 1953, more than a thousand people came to the Lao Shan Forest Farm to dig for medicinal herbs every day, and over 80,000 trees were damaged. The losses caused by this in 1954 and this year are similarly large.

　　In order to protect the state-owned forest farm from losses and also take into account the production of medicinal herbs, we request that relevant departments earnestly study the conflict between tree production and medicinal herb production in the Lao Shan Forest Farm and come up with feasible solutions to resolve this conflict.

Editor's Note: The conflict between forest protection and herb collection in the Lao Shan Forest Farm can be resolved. It is hoped that the three special districts of Yang Zhou, Chu County, and Wu Hu will educate local farmers to dig medicinal herbs on the premise of protecting young trees; the forest farm should, in a guided manner, organize the excavation of kudzu vines, mountain flowers, and other medicinal herbs that grow at the roots of trees, so as not to hinder the growth of young trees.

### 扬州、滁县、芜湖三专区　必须解决护林和采药的矛盾

　　扬州、滁县、芜湖三专区 　 必须解决护林和采药的矛盾编辑同志：
    江苏省江浦县的老山林场，面积有十万多亩。这个林区出产百多种药材，其中何首乌、山花、葛藤等药材，多生长在林木根部，根深有二尺到五尺左右，要挖掘这些药材，必然会影响到幼林的生长，因此在我们这里挖药材和保护林木的矛盾一直没有解决。过去林业部门曾向全椒等县供销合作社提出不要收购何首乌等三种药材，但由于没有从根本问题上来研究切实可行的办法，供销部门并没有接受这一建议。
    老山林场是属江苏管辖的，但是，这个林场的药材生产问题，又涉及到江苏、安徽两省的扬州、滁县、芜湖三个专区。因为在江苏的江浦和安徽的滁县、和县、全椒等县之间，有乌衣、香泉、星甸等六个区二十多个乡的农民，都要到这里来挖药材，如果只是林业部门严加限制，不允许农民入场挖取药材，这不仅会影响药材的生产，而且也是行不通的。近几年来，由于问题得不到解决，林场遭受破坏的情况是严重的。如在一九五三年四月十五日到二十五日的十天间，每天到老山林场来挖药材的有一千多人，被破坏的林木就有八万多株。一九五四年和今年因此造成的损失，同样也很大。
    为了保护国营林场不受损失，同时又要照顾到药材的生产，我们要求有关部门切实研究一下老山林场树木生产与药材生产的矛盾，并想出可行的办法解决这个矛盾。　陈　干　戴德清
    编者按：老山林场的护林和采药的矛盾是可以解决的。希望扬州、滁县、芜湖三个专区教育当地农民在爱护幼林的前提下挖掘药材；林场方面对于生长在林木根部的葛藤、山花等药材应该有领导地组织挖掘，以免妨碍幼林的成长。
