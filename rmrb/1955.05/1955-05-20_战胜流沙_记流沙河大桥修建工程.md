　　Conquering the Quicksand
　　——A Record of the Liusha River Bridge Construction Project
　　Zhang Xueyu
　　Traveling by car from Ya'an along the Kang-Dian Highway, passing over range after range of hills and mountains, and speeding across vast and fertile plains, one arrives at the famous Liusha (Quicksand) River.

　　This is a dry riverbed, over 370 meters wide, that bisects the Kang-Dian Highway. During the dry season, only a small stream of water flows, and a simple bridge can be built for pedestrians and vehicles to cross. However, in the summer and autumn seasons, when mountain floods erupt, the river’s water roars like a ferocious beast, carrying away the river sand and stones. The floodwaters submerge the entire riverbed, making it impossible for pedestrians and vehicles to cross, and even ferries dare not operate.

　　For many years, this river has severely hindered transportation in Xikang Province. Travelers on the Kang-Dian Highway and the people of Hanyuan County have needed a bridge here. After liberation, the construction of this bridge was included in the province's transportation construction plan. After repeated investigations and studies by the Provincial Department of Transportation, it was decided to build a reinforced concrete bridge using advanced Soviet technical standards, based on the shape of the river.

　　Construction of the bridge began last October, and by this April, the project had entered a tense stage. From far away from the construction site, one could hear a constant roar of motors and the heavy sound of pile drivers. On a road leading to the construction site, cars, flatbed carts, and pushcarts, loaded with steel, cement, and various materials needed for bridge construction, were constantly heading to the site. At the construction site, countless workers, each with a heroic and high-spirited demeanor, shouted slogans and worked enthusiastically. Their slogan was: "Race against time, fight against the floods, and never stop until the task is completed!"

　　Time is indeed precious for the people building the Liusha River Bridge; not even a minute or a second can be wasted. Recently, the leadership gave Wu Guoxi's work team of ordinary laborers an urgent task: to complete the tamping of the foundation for the eighth pier support within thirty-six hours. After accepting the task, Wu Guoxi's team successfully completed it within thirty-five hours. Because they knew that if they didn't seize the time, the floods would come and all work would be impossible.

　　Currently, three of the five concrete bridge surfaces over the main stream of the Liusha River Bridge have been completed. If the concrete formwork is removed, the prototype of the bridge can be seen. The workers building the bridge have formulated a plan to complete the remaining two concrete bridge surfaces over the main stream before the floods arrive, and all the foundation work, whether for the main bridge or the auxiliary bridges, must be completed.

　　But completing this task requires overcoming many difficulties, the first of which is to conquer the quicksand.

　　Last winter, when digging the foundation pits for piers four, five, six, and seven, water constantly seeped into the pits from all directions after only digging one meter deep. The river sand and pebbles around the pits also collapsed into the pits due to the impact of the water. The workers dug a little in the pit, and the river sand and pebbles above would collapse a little. The deeper the pit was dug, the greater the amount of water seepage and the more quicksand there was. When the pit was dug to about two meters deep, it could no longer be dug deeper. The workers changed the method of digging, concentrating all the water pumps in this pit, using a drainage capacity of several thousand gallons per minute to concentrate on pumping water, but they still couldn't pump the water dry, and the river sand and stones continued to collapse downward. So they decided to build a wooden frame in the pit to block the quicksand. The result was still a failure. However, failure did not shake their determination to conquer the quicksand. They summed up their experiences and lessons each time and improved their work each time, determined to fight the quicksand to the end, and finally conquered the river water and quicksand, ensuring the smooth progress of the excavation project.

　　People are always concerned about the construction of the Liusha River Bridge. During the construction, local farmers, students, and cadres often came to the construction site to visit, some even coming from dozens of miles away. After visiting, many people wrote letters of appreciation and gave red scarves to the workers building the Liusha River Bridge. Nearby farmers washed and mended clothes for the workers and sent the vegetables they grew to the construction site to meet the workers' needs. Some farmers also directly participated in the construction of the Liusha River Bridge. All this enthusiastic support has encouraged the people building the Liusha River Bridge.

　　战胜流沙
　　——记流沙河大桥修建工程
　　张学愚
    从雅安乘汽车，沿康滇公路行驶，翻过一重一重的丘陵和高山，驰过广阔肥沃的平原，便到了著名的流沙河。
    这是一条宽达三百七十多公尺的干涸河滩，它把康滇公路拦腰截断。在枯水季节，河滩上只有一小股流水，搭一座便桥便可供行人和车辆过往。可是，一到夏秋两季，山洪暴发，这条河的水便像一只凶暴的猛兽咆哮起来，河里的河沙和石头也要被它卷走。洪水淹没了整个河滩，不说是行人和车辆不能过往，就连渡船也不敢开渡。
    多少年来，这条河对于西康交通的阻碍是非常严重的，康滇公路的旅客和汉源县的人民都需要在这里修建一座桥。解放以后，这座桥的修建便列入了全省交通建设计划。经过省交通厅多次的反复调查研究，决定根据这条河流的形状，采用苏联先进的技术标准，修建一座钢筋混凝土的大桥。
    这座大桥从去年十月开工，到今年四月，工程已进入紧张阶段。离工地很远的地方就听见一片轰轰扎扎的马达声和沉重的椿锤声。在一条通向施工现场的公路上，汽车、板板车和架架车，满载着钢材、水泥和建桥所需的各种物资，源源不断地开往工地。工地上，密麻无数的工人，一个个雄赳赳气昂昂地喊着号子，干得火热。他们的口号是：“与时间赛跑，和洪水斗争，不完成任务，决不收兵”。
    时间，对于修建流沙河大桥的人们来说，的确是太可贵了，那怕是一分一秒，也不能让它轻易过去。最近，领导上给了普工班吴国熹小组一个紧急任务，要他们在三十六小时内完成第八孔撑架基础的填夯任务；吴国熹小组在接受任务后，提前在三十五小时内就胜利地完成了。因为他们知道：如果不抓紧时间，洪水一来，一切工作都不能进行。
    现在，流沙河大桥主流上的五孔混凝土桥面工程已经打好三孔了，如果把混凝土的模型板拆开，便可以看见这座大桥的雏型。修筑大桥的职工已订出计划，决定赶洪水到来之前，要把主流上剩下的两孔混凝土桥面打好外，所有的，无论是正桥和辅助桥的基础工程，都要全部完成。
    但是要完成这个任务是要克服很多困难的，首先是要战胜流沙。
    去年冬天，在挖四、五、六、七号桥墩的基坑时，才挖到一公尺深，河水就不断地从四面八方渗透到基坑里面来，基坑周围的河沙和卵石也随着河水的冲击不断地向基坑里面垮塌。工人们在基坑里面挖一点，上面的河沙卵石便垮一点；基坑挖得越深，水的渗透量就越大，流沙也就越多。基坑挖到两公尺左右深的时候，就不能再向下挖了。工人们改变了挖的方法，把所有的抽水机都集中到这个基坑里来，以每分钟数千加仑的排水量，集中力量抽水，可是仍然不能把水抽干，河沙和石子仍旧不断地向下垮塌。于是他们又决定在基坑里做上一个木框架来挡住流沙。结果还是失败了。可是，失败丝毫也没有动摇他们战胜流沙的意志。他们总结一次经验教训，便改进一次工作，坚决和流沙斗争到底，终于战胜了河水和流沙，保证了挖基工程的顺利进行。
    人们时时刻刻都关心着流沙河大桥的建设。在施工中间，经常有当地的农民、学生同机关干部来到工地上参观，有的甚至从数十里以外的地方赶来。许多人在参观以后，纷纷给建设流沙河大桥的职工写慰问信和赠送红领巾。附近的农民给工人们补洗衣服，把自己种出来的蔬菜送到工地上去，供应工人的需要。有的农民还直接参加了流沙河大桥的建设。所有这些热情的支援，都鼓舞着建设流沙河大桥的人们。　（摘编自西康日报）
