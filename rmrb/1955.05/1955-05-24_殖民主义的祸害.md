　　The Scourge of Colonialism
　　Feng Binfu
    The unanimous adoption of a resolution by the Asian-African Conference declaring colonialism a scourge that should be eradicated rapidly is no accident. Having suffered from the cruel colonial rule of Western colonial countries for hundreds of years, the people of Asia and Africa are particularly familiar with the essence of colonialism and feel the urgent need to eradicate this scourge rapidly.
    Foreign trade is one of the important weapons used by imperialism to cruelly exploit and plunder backward countries through colonialism. Imperialist trade with colonies and dependencies is not conducted on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and adaptation to the economic development needs of both sides, but on the basis of unequal exchange, focusing on obtaining cheap raw materials and markets for dumping goods.
    Imperialism forces backward countries to specialize in the production or mining of a single or several raw materials and grains, thus giving the economies of backward countries a deformed and one-sided character, making these countries extremely dependent on the world capitalist market for foreign trade. Imperialism uses this dependence to manipulate international raw material prices to intensify economic exploitation of colonies and dependencies. A recent example is the way American monopoly organizations have lowered the prices of rubber and tin, enabling American monopoly capitalists to obtain new profits while severely impacting the economies of tin- and rubber-producing countries in Southeast Asia.
    The colonial nature of this trade is clearly reflected in the composition of import and export commodities. The goods that colonial countries import from colonies and dependencies are mostly raw materials and grains, while the goods that colonial countries export to colonies and dependencies are mostly consumer goods. For example, in 1951, American monopoly organizations sold about 70 percent of the total U.S. cigarette exports and more than 82 percent of inferior cloth exports on the markets of colonies and dependencies. Also, in the same period, the United States imported 95 million U.S. dollars of cloth and 19 million U.S. dollars of dairy products into the Philippines, while only 1.4 million U.S. dollars of industrial and agricultural machinery.
    Imperialism sells its products at very high monopoly prices in the markets of backward countries, while buying raw materials and grains at very low monopoly prices. This unequal exchange allows monopoly capital to obtain huge profits. They also continue to expand this price difference to strengthen the exploitation of the people of backward countries. According to statistics, in 1950, the average value of 100 pounds of Malayan rubber was 35.4 U.S. dollars, but by July 1954, it was only worth 22.8 U.S. dollars. In the same period, the price of 100 pounds of Egyptian cotton fell from 59.8 U.S. dollars to 38.7 U.S. dollars. During this period, the price of imported goods rose sharply. For example, compared to 1950, the import price index in Ceylon rose by 23 percent in 1953, and in Egypt by 31 percent.
    Another feature of imperialism's plunder and exploitation of the people of colonies and dependencies is capital export. Seventy-five percent of British foreign investment, both before and now, is concentrated in countries belonging to the British Empire, other colonies, and dependencies. In 1950, the total amount of direct U.S. investment in colonies and dependencies was almost twice that before World War II. The rate of profit on U.S. investment in colonies and dependencies is much higher than at home. For example, in 1951, the rate of profit on U.S. investment in Latin America was 66 percent higher than at home, and more than 114 percent higher in other colonies and dependencies. According to the analysis of the American economist V. Panlo, the average profit of American capital invested abroad is the highest in Asia and Africa. The profit obtained by the United States in the Middle East is 31.3 percent. The profit obtained by American oil companies in Saudi Arabia reached 700 percent of the production cost. This fully illustrates the cruel exploitation of the people of Asia and Africa by American imperialism.
    The facts clearly show that the profits that American monopoly organizations obtain by enslaving and consistently plundering colonies and backward countries are many times greater than the expenses the U.S. government uses for so-called "aid." In the eight years from 1946 to 1953, the United States gave a total of 189 million U.S. dollars in economic and technical "aid" to Latin American countries, while in the same period, American monopoly capitalists exploited 5.843 billion U.S. dollars in profits from Latin America. Moreover, this so-called "aid" itself is just an export of surplus commodities. Moreover, the ensuing “embargo” has severely devastated the industry and agriculture of some Asian countries. From 1952 to 1953, U.S. "aid" to Indonesia was 3.5 million U.S. dollars, while Indonesia suffered losses of 138 million U.S. dollars due to the U.S. embargo policy.
    From 1949 to the end of 1954, the United States had signed enslaving bilateral agreements in the name of "technical cooperation" with 68 countries and territories in Latin America, Asia, the Near East, and Africa under the so-called "Point Four Program." These agreements stipulate the establishment of military strategic bases and increase the production of raw materials for the U.S. military industry, making the United States further intensify its control over these countries.

    The cruel exploitation and plunder of colonialism have prevented the development of productive forces in backward countries, leaving backward countries in a state of stagnation, extreme poverty, and bankruptcy for a long time. According to United Nations statistics, in colonies and dependencies, which account for two-thirds of the world's capitalist population, industrial output accounts for about one-twentieth, and national income is less than one-sixth. The average per capita consumption of textiles in Asian and African colonies and dependencies is one-fifth to one-sixth of that in Europe. During World War II and the post-war period, the industry of backward countries has developed slightly, but it is neither sufficient to guarantee the people's need for industrial products, nor can it guarantee the need for the development of agriculture. Imperialism always tries every means to hinder backward countries from establishing and developing independent industries. The United States' constant claim to give backward countries "industrial aid" is completely shameless deception. The "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development" controlled by the United States once said: "Generally speaking, capital should be applied to areas that can recover the greatest profits." Monopoly capital only focuses on maximizing profits, and of course, will not think about the interests of the people of backward countries. According to United Nations statistics, Africa's share in world power resource consumption has been stagnating at the level of one percent. Cruz, the Chilean representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, reported in 1948: "The industrialization of Latin America has not made any progress for more than ten years." Under the rule of American imperialism, the Philippines has not established any industry except for the enterprises necessary to turn exported raw materials into semi-finished products. Before World War II, "not even a pin or nail could be manufactured."
    Agriculture in colonies and dependencies is declining. Many of these countries were exporting grain before the war, but now they are importing grain, even though the consumption level of residents in these countries has declined.
    The people of colonies and dependencies possess rich natural resources and vast lands. But none of this wealth belongs to them. Hundreds of millions of people are deprived of the most basic human rights. Increasing unemployment, low wages, unbearable hunger and poverty, lack of medical care and sanitation, and short lifespans, these are the scourges that colonialism has inflicted on them.

    No matter how European colonialists struggle, no matter how rampant the most ferocious and ambitious American colonialists become, the era in which colonialists can do whatever they want in colonies is gone forever. Premier Zhou Enlai said: "Colonialism is bound to be completely eliminated in Asian and African countries and in all countries of the world."

　　殖民主义的祸害
　　冯宾符
    亚非会议一致通过决议，宣布殖民主义是一种应当迅速予以根除的祸害，决不是偶然的。亚非人民身受西方殖民国家几百年来残酷的殖民统治，特别清楚地熟悉殖民主义的实质，而痛切感到有迅速根除这种祸害的必要。
    对外贸易，是帝国主义对落后国家残酷地进行殖民剥削和掠夺的重要武器之一。帝国主义对殖民地、附属地的贸易，不是根据平等互利、适应双方经济发展的需要的原则来进行，而是在不等价交换的基础上进行，着眼于取得廉价的原料和倾销商品的市场。
    帝国主义强迫落后国家专门从事生产或开采单一或几种原料和粮食，这样就使得落后国家经济具有畸形的片面性质，从而使这些国家在对外贸易上处于极端倚赖世界资本主义市场的地位。帝国主义利用这种倚赖，操纵国际原料价格，来加紧对于殖民地、附属地的经济压榨。最近二年来，美国垄断组织压低橡胶和锡的价格，使美国垄断资本家获得新的利润，而使东南亚产锡、产橡胶各国的经济，受到了严重的打击，便是一个例证。
    这种贸易的殖民性质，在进出口商品的构成上表现得很清楚。殖民国家从殖民地、附属地进口的商品大部分是原料和粮食，而殖民国家向殖民地、附属地出口的却大部分是消费品。例如在一九五一年，美国垄断组织在殖民地、附属地市场上销售了美国香烟输出总额的百分之七十左右，劣等布匹占输出总额的百分之八十二以上。又如在同期，美国输入到菲律宾的布匹为九千五百万美元，乳品一千九百万美元，而工农机器只有一百四十万美元。
    帝国主义在落后国家市场上按照很高的垄断价格出卖自己的产品，同时却按照很低的垄断价格收购原料和粮食。这种不等价的交换，使垄断资本获得巨大的利润。它们还不断扩大这种价格上的差别，来加强对落后国家人民的剥削。据统计，一九五○年每百磅马来亚橡胶平均值三十五点四美元，而到了一九五四年七月，却只值二十二点八美元。在同一时期，每一百磅埃及棉花价格从五十九点八美元跌到三十八点七美元。这时期，进口货却大大涨了价。例如同一九五○年比较，锡兰在一九五三年的进口价格指数上涨了百分之二十三，埃及百分之三十一。
    帝国主义掠夺和剥削殖民地、附属地人民的另一特征就是资本输出。英国有百分之七十五的国外投资，无论在战前和现在都集中在不列颠帝国所属各国、其他殖民地和附属地。一九五○年美国对殖民地、附属地直接投资总额，几乎为第二次大战前的两倍。美国在殖民地、附属地的投资利润率远比国内为高。例如在一九五一年，美国在拉丁美洲的投资利润率要比国内高百分之六十六，在其他殖民地、附属地要超过百分之一百十四。据美国经济学者维·潘洛的分析，美国资本在国外投资的平均利润以亚非地区为最多。美国在中东所获的利润为百分之三十一点三。美国石油公司在沙特阿拉伯所获利润达到生产成本的百分之七百。这充分地说明美帝国主义对亚非人民的残酷剥削。
    事实判然：美国垄断组织靠奴役和一贯掠夺殖民地和落后国家而捞得的利润，比美国政府用于所谓“援助”的费用多许多倍。从一九四六——一九五三年这八年中，美国给拉丁美洲各国的经济和技术的“援助”共一亿八千九百万美元，而同一时期，美国垄断资本家从拉丁美洲剥削来的利润则是五十八亿四千三百万美元。何况这种所谓“援助”本身不过是一种剩余商品的输出。而且随之而来的
  “禁运”，使得一些亚洲国家的工业和农业受到严重的摧残。从一九五二年到一九五三年，美国给印度尼西亚的“援助”为三百五十万美元，而印度尼西亚由于美国禁运政策而遭受的损失则为一亿三千八百万美元。
    从一九四九年到一九五四年底，美国已根据所谓“第四点计划”同六十八个拉丁美洲、亚洲、近东和非洲的国家和领土签订了以“技术合作”为名的奴役性的双边协定。这些协定规定建立军事战略基地，并为美国军事工业增加原料生产，使得美国进一步加紧了对这些国家的控制。

    殖民主义的残酷剥削和掠夺，阻止了落后国家的生产力的发展，使得落后国家长期处于停滞、极端贫困和破产的状态。据联合国统计，在占有资本主义世界人口三分之二的殖民地和附属地，工业产量大约只占二十分之一，国民收入还不足六分之一。亚洲和非洲殖民地、附属地平均每人纺织品的消费量为欧洲的五—六分之一。在第二次大战期间和战后时期，落后国家的工业虽有稍许发展，但既不足保证人民对工业品的需要，也谈不到保证发展农业的需要。帝国主义总是千方百计阻碍落后国家建立和发展独立自主的工业。美国口口声声要给落后国家以“工业援助”，完全是无耻的欺骗。美国控制的“国际复兴开发银行”曾经说：“总的说来，资本应用于那些能收回最大的盈利的地区。”垄断资本着眼的只是最大限度的利润，当然不会想到落后国家人民的利益。据联合国统计，非洲在世界动力资源消费中所占比重，一直停滞在百分之一的水平上。智利驻联合国经济暨社会理事会代表克鲁兹在一九四八年报告称：“拉丁美洲的工业化十年多来没有丝毫进展。”菲律宾在美帝国主义统治下，除了把出口原料变成半制品所必需的企业外，就没有建立过任何工业。在第二次世界大战前，“甚至连一根别针或钉子都不能制造。”
    殖民地和附属地的农业正在衰落。许多这些国家在战前是输出粮食的，现在却输入粮食了，虽然这些国家居民的消费水平反而低落了。
    殖民地和附属地的人民拥有着富饶的天然资源和辽阔的土地。但所有这些财富却没有他们的份。亿万人民被剥夺了人类最基本的权利。不断增长的失业，低微的工资，不能忍受的饥饿和贫穷，缺乏医药卫生，短促的寿命，这些便是殖民主义加给他们的祸害。

    不管欧洲的殖民主义者怎样挣扎，不管最凶恶，野心最大的美国殖民主义者怎样的更加猖狂，可是殖民主义者对殖民地可以为所欲为的时代是一去不返了。周恩来总理说：“殖民主义在亚非各国以及在世界各国是一定要彻底消灭的。”
