　　From Two Hundred and Thirty-Nine People Reduced to One Hundred and Eighteen People
　　——Before and After the Organizational Restructuring of the Zhejiang Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau
　　Liu Fan
　　In the current work of streamlining organizations and reducing staff, there are still many people who doubt: Won't this affect the work of the organization? Can it improve work efficiency? Can it improve leadership style? The drastically different situations before and after the organizational restructuring of the Zhejiang Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau in 1954 definitively answer this question.
　　Before the restructuring, the Zhejiang Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau had a bloated organization, overlapping layers, and a staggering amount of overstaffing, which led to serious bureaucracy, preoccupation with routine matters, and a bureaucratic style. Here are a few examples: When the bureau's leadership assigned work, they often started with a bureau affairs meeting attended by section chiefs, followed by a group leader meeting, then a group member meeting, and finally a full section meeting. Work that could have been assigned in half a day often took two or three days due to these three layers and four meetings. The bureau's office had a general affairs group consisting of fourteen people. Although the division of labor within the group was already very detailed, there were still two cadres who could not be assigned specific tasks. As a result, they were called "helping cadres," and the help they provided was limited to distributing office supplies once a month. The office itself had a total of thirty-six staff members, in addition to a five-person document transit station. Although the bureau had a large volume of documents, it was not enough to keep these five young and strong young men busy. What to do? So the office made a rule: all documents and letters, including the exchange of documents and letters between the various departments within the bureau, must be handed over to the document transit station for transit! As a result, an incident occurred in 1954: When the business section needed to process documents related to the production and sales contract of the Taizhou Saltworks, they had to consult with the storage and transportation section, which was only a wall away. Due to the office's regulations, the business section not only sent a document to the storage and transportation section, but also handed it over to the document transit station. As a result, this document traveled through twelve departments and twenty-four checkpoints of section chiefs and staff members, bearing twenty-four stamps, and took thirty-eight days to travel in a courtyard of less than one hundred meters in diameter. In this bureau, not only did sections correspond with each other, but even groups that were not at the same organizational level corresponded with each other. As a result, documents and forms greatly increased. According to statistics for the third quarter of 1953, the number of documents issued alone was 2,375, and there were 73 types of statistical forms. This large number of documents and forms became a breeding ground for the preoccupation with routine matters and bureaucratic style of the responsible comrades in the organization. The leading staff of the bureau originally wanted to go deep into the grassroots and overcome their bureaucratic shortcomings of being high above and not understanding the situation below, but how could they leave? They were entangled all day long by documents and forms piled up more than a foot high on their desks.
　　Enough, these examples are enough to illustrate the need for this organization to streamline its structure and reduce staff. However, when the higher authorities instructed them to restructure and streamline, the bureau's leadership, while feeling that there was a need for reform, also worried whether reducing organizations and personnel would have good results. Of course, the countless facts after the restructuring completely dispelled these concerns. After two consecutive restructurings in the first half of 1954, the entire bureau was reduced from fourteen sections and two hundred and thirty-nine people to eight sections and one hundred and eighteen people. This not only greatly reduced the state's administrative expenditures, saving more than 60,500 yuan per year in staff salaries alone, but more importantly, it improved the organization's leadership style and work methods, and improved work efficiency. Because the number of personnel was reduced by nearly half, and the workload increased significantly, the leadership first studied how to reduce documents and forms, and save manpower and resources. As a result, the number of forms in the entire bureau gradually decreased from the original 73 to 26, and the number of documents issued in the third quarter of last year also decreased from 2,375 in the same quarter of the previous year to 1,293. Secondly, due to the reduction of documents and forms and the reduction of organizational affairs, the leading staff of the bureau gradually freed themselves from the shackles of bureaucracy and preoccupation with routine matters, and began to go deep into the grassroots, help with work, and discover and solve problems on the spot. According to statistics for the third quarter of last year, a total of 46 staff members of the bureau went to the saltworks on 67 occasions, which is almost double the number of visits in the same quarter of 1953. Among them, 12 staff members above the section chief level went to the saltworks. In August last year, when Bureau Chief Wang Jianqun went to the Yuhuan Saltworks in Wenzhou, he encountered a serious situation where the small tide could not enter the saltworks, the brine source was reduced, and salt production might be greatly reduced. Bureau Chief Wang went deep to understand the situation and conducted research with staff and salt farmers, and finally found a way to use waterwheels to bring the tide water to the saltworks, which resulted in an increase of 100,000 piculs in saltworks production. For example, the saltworks in Gongmen and Qiaotou townships in Daishan County are located in low-lying areas and are easily flooded by the tide, making it difficult for the saltworks to dry and affecting brine production. In August last year, Deputy Bureau Chief He Zhibin led a working group to the site, mobilized the staff and salt farmers of these two townships to build a 2,185-meter-long embankment, which blocked the half-October high tide and typhoon, benefiting 548 mu of land and producing 5,280 dan of salt, which further encouraged the enthusiasm of local salt farmers for production. In the third quarter of 1953, the bureau chief had not visited the saltworks even once.
　　After the restructuring, the work of the organization itself has also taken on a new look. The reduction of organizations and personnel has not only not affected the work of the organization, but has greatly improved it. After the restructuring, the eleven people in the administrative section not only completed the work originally undertaken by eighteen people, but also carried out the mass warehouse protection work that had not been done for a long time. They went to saltworks such as Andong and Yuhuan to mobilize salt farmers, established warehouse protection groups, and eliminated salt warehouse losses. The office was reduced from the original thirty-six people to sixteen people, but it not only completed all tasks, but also started the publication "Salt Affairs Work Communication" to guide salt affairs work. The general affairs group was reduced from fourteen people to five people, and took on the entire general affairs work of the organization, and it was done in a more orderly manner. The comrades in the general affairs group reflected: "I really didn't expect that the number of people was reduced by almost two-thirds, but the work was done better."
　　Although many organizations and half of the personnel have been streamlined through two restructurings last year, and the leadership style and work methods have also been improved, the leadership of the Zhejiang Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau is not satisfied with this, and does not believe that their establishment no longer needs to be reorganized, and that personnel can no longer be reduced. Li Zhongyong, chief of the personnel section, said: According to their recent understanding, a part of the cadres in the bureau can still be transferred to enrich the grassroots organizations. Now, the leadership of the bureau is formulating a third restructuring plan in accordance with the spirit of the instructions from the higher authorities and the People's Daily editorial "Seriously Carry Out the Work of Reorganizing the Establishment and Streamlining the Organization," in order to use human resources more rationally and further improve the work efficiency of the organization!

    从二百三十九人减到一百一十八人
　　——浙江省盐务管理局机关整编前后
　　刘凡
    在目前整顿编制精简机构的工作中，还有不少的人在怀疑：这样不会影响机关工作吗？能够提高工作效率吗？可以改进领导作风吗？浙江省盐务管理局一九五四年整编前后截然不同的情况，就肯定地回答了这个问题。
    整编以前，浙江省盐务管理局的机构臃肿，层次重叠，人浮于事的现象是惊人的，因而文牍主义、事务主义、官僚主义的作风也是严重的。请看几个例子：局的领导上布置工作，常常是先开由科长参加的局务会，再开组长会，再开组员会，以后又开全科大会。本来半天的时间即可布置下去的工作，经过这样三层四个会，往往就要拖上两三天。局的办公室里就有十四个人组成的总务组，尽管组里分工已经很细，但还有两个干部无法安排具体工作，于是就被称为“帮忙干部”，而所帮的忙，只不过是每月帮着发一次办公用品而已。办公室本身共有三十六个工作人员，另外还附了一个五个人组成的公文转运站，虽然这个局的公文已经很多，但也无法使这五个年青力壮的小伙子忙起来。怎么办呢？于是办公室作了一个规定：一切公文、信件的往来，包括局内各个科室之间公文信件的往来，全部要交公文转运站转运！结果一九五四年竟发生了这样一件事：业务科要处理台州盐场产销联系合同的公文时，必须同仅仅一壁之隔的储运科商量，由于办公室的规定，业务科不但对储运科行了文，还照样也交公文转运站转运，于是这件公文竟在方圆不到一百公尺的院子里，周转了十二个科室，经过了科长、科员的二十四道关口，盖了二十四个图章，旅行了三十八天之久。这个局里不但科与科之间行文，甚至不是一级组织的组与组之间也在行文。于是公文、表格就大大增加，据一九五三年第三季度统计，单是发文一项，就有二千三百七十五件，统计表格达七十三种。而这样多的公文和表格，就成了机关负责同志事务主义和官僚主义滋长的温床：局的领导工作人员，本来也很想深入下层，克服自己高高在上，不了解下情的官僚主义毛病，但是，他们怎么能离得开呢？整天都被案头堆得一尺多高的公文和表格纠缠着。
    够了，这些例子，已经足够说明这个机关必须整顿编制精简机构的情况了。但是，当上级指示要整编和精简时，局的领导上虽然一方面也痛感这种情况有改革的必要，但另一方面又顾虑减少机构和人员会不会就有好的收效。当然，整编以后的无数事实完全扫除了这些顾虑。经过一九五四年前半年连续两次整编，全局由十四个科室二百三十九人精减为八个科室和一百一十八人了。这样，不但大量节减了国家的行政支出，仅仅工作人员的薪金一项，每年即可节约六万零五百多元，更重要的是改进了机关的领导作风和工作方法，提高了工作效率。由于人员减少将近一半，工作任务相对的大大增加，于是领导上就首先研究减少公文和表格，节约人力和物力。结果全局的表格从原来的七十三种逐步减少到二十六种，去年第三季度的发文数字，也从前年同一季度的二千三百七十五件减少到一千二百九十三件了。其次，局的领导工作人员由于公文、表格的减少，机关事务的减少，也逐步摆脱了文牍主义和事务主义的羁绊，开始深入下层，帮助工作，就地发现问题和解决问题了。据去年第三季度统计，局里的工作人员先后下盐场的就有四十六人，共六十七次，这较一九五三年同一季度下场的次数增加将近一倍，其中科长以上工作人员下盐场的也有十二人。去年八月，局长汪健群去温州玉环盐场时，正碰到小潮水不能进入盐场，卤源减少，盐产量可能大减的严重情况。汪局长就深入了解情况，同工作人员、盐民进行研究，终于找出水车接水车把潮水车到盐场的办法，结果使盐场产量提高了十万石。又如岱山县宫门、桥头两乡盐场地势低，潮水一来即被淹没，以致盐场不易干燥，影响出卤。去年八月间，副局长何志斌带领工作组亲到现场，动员这两个乡的工作人员和盐民筑了一条二千一百八十五公尺的浦塘，挡住了十月半的大潮和台风，受益地五百四十八亩，成盐五千二百八十担，这就更加鼓舞了当地盐民生产的积极性。而一九五三年的第三季度，局长连一次盐场都没去过。
    整编以后，机关本身的工作也有了新的气象，机构和人员的减少，不但没有影响了机关工作，反而大大改进了机关工作。整编后，行政科的十一人，除完成了原来十八个人所担负的工作，过去长期未作的群众护仓工作也开展起来了。他们曾到庵东、玉环等盐场动员盐民，建立了护仓小组，杜绝了盐仓的损耗。办公室由原来的三十六人减少到十六人，不但完成了全部任务，还创办了指导盐务工作的刊物“盐务工作通讯”。总务组由十四人减到五人，就把整个机关的总务工作担负起来了，而且作得比较有条理。总务组的同志反映：“真想不到，人减少了差不多三分之二，工作反而作得好了。”
    虽然，经过去年两次整编精减了不少机构和一半的人员，领导作风和工作方法也有了改进，但是，浙江省盐务管理局的领导上并不以此为满足，并不认为他们的编制再不需要整顿，人员再不可能减少了。人事科科长李忠勇就说：根据他们最近了解的情况，局里还可以抽出一部分干部去充实下层机构。现在，该局领导上正在根据上级指示和人民日报社论“认真进行整顿编制精简机构的工作”的精神，制定第三次整编方案，为更加合理地使用人力，进一步提高机关的工作效率而努力！
