Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 14th: The Vietnamese People's Army units taking over Haiphong held a grand entry ceremony on the 14th.

Early in the morning, Haiphong residents gathered on both sides of Le Thanh Ton Road and Tran Hung Dao Road. Yesterday, they had already built an exquisite archway, adorned with various colored light bulbs. Today, they were dressed in festive attire to welcome the People's Army into the city. Overseas Chinese residing in Haiphong also lined up along the road, holding banners that read "Long Live President Ho" and "Long Live Chairman Mao," to welcome the troops.

At 6:00 AM, the infantry, led by the "Determined to Fight, Determined to Win" red flag, began to enter the city with neat military bearing. Women, the elderly, and children rushed forward to offer flowers, and colored confetti fluttered in the wind.

With the rumbling of military vehicles, powerful howitzer units, anti-aircraft artillery units, and anti-aircraft machine gun units entered the city one after another. At this moment, thunderous cheers and applause erupted from the jubilant crowd.

At 10:00 AM, the entering troops held a celebration ceremony in the central square of Haiphong. Tens of thousands of Haiphong citizens participated in this ceremony. At the celebration ceremony, Du Mai, Chairman of the Haiphong Military and Administrative Committee, and Major General Huang Sen, Commander of the People's Army units taking over Haiphong, respectively read President Ho Chi Minh's message to the people of Haiphong, General Commander Vo Nguyen Giap's order to the takeover troops, and the Haiphong Military and Administrative Committee's announcement. The masses of Haiphong citizens participating in the ceremony expressed their support for these documents with enthusiastic applause.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th: The Vietnamese People's Army took over the ninth section of the Haiphong area—Do Son—on the 15th. So far, the area north of the 17th parallel, with the exception of the coastal islands in the Haiphong area that remain to be taken over, has been completely liberated.

At 6:10 AM on the 15th, the People's Army began to advance towards the ninth district, and French troops' trucks, tanks, and troops gradually retreated towards the port. By about 10:00 AM, the People's Army had taken over Do Son Airport, the French stronghold that was originally located in Do Son Township, and part of the French barracks. From 2:00 PM, the French troops continued to withdraw from the barracks and ports in other areas, and all withdrew on more than a dozen warships anchored on the sea surface before 4:00 PM.

Do Son originally belonged to Kien An Province and had a township and eight communes. It is a beautiful seaside resort. In early 1954, the French army drove away all the residents, and it completely became a French military base. Today, when the People's Army took over, pillboxes, barbed wire, and minefields with the word "Danger" written on them could be seen almost everywhere. There were no residents, and the original fields were completely barren.

　　接管海防的越南人民军举行入城式
　　越南人民军接管海防地区的涂山
    新华社河内十四日电  十四日，接管海防的越南人民军部队举行了盛大的入城式。
    清早，海防居民就聚集在黎圣遵路和陈兴道路两旁。昨天一夜，他们已经搭好一个精致的牌楼，在上面缀满各色灯泡，今天他们都穿上节日的服装，来欢迎人民军的入城。旅居海防的华侨也高举着“胡主席万岁”、“毛主席万岁”的标语，在路旁列队欢迎部队。
    六时，以“决战决胜”红旗为前导的步兵队伍，以整齐的军容开始进入市区。妇女、老人和少年儿童都奔上来献花，彩色纸屑随风飘舞。
    随着军车的隆隆轰鸣，强大的榴弹炮部队、高射炮部队、高射机关枪部队相继进入市内。这时腾欢的群众中爆发了春雷般的欢呼声和掌声。
    十时，入城部队在海防市内的中心广场举行庆祝典礼。海防市数万市民参加了这一典礼。在庆祝典礼上，海防市军政委员会主席杜梅、接管海防的人民军部队指挥官黄森少将等分别宣读了胡志明主席给海防人民的文告、武元甲总司令给接管部队的命令和海防市军政委员会的通告。参加典礼的海防市市民群众以热烈鼓掌表示拥护这些文告。
    新华社河内十五日电  越南人民军在十五日接管了海防地区的第九段——涂山。至此，十七线以北的地区除尚待接管的海防区沿海岛屿以外，已经完全解放了。
    十五日清晨六时十分，人民军开始向第九区前进，法军的卡车、坦克和部队逐步向港口收缩。到十时许，人民军便接管了涂山机场、原为涂山市镇所在地的法军据点和一部分法军兵营。法军在下午二时起继续撤离其他地区的兵营和港口，在下午四时以前全部乘停泊在海面的十多艘兵舰撤走。
    涂山原属建安省，有一个市镇和八个社，是风景优美的海滨避暑地。一九五四年初，法军把全部居民赶走后，这里便完全变成法军的驻地。今天人民军接管时，几乎到处可以看到碉堡、铁丝网和写着危险字样的地雷区，没有一个居民，原来的田地已全部荒废。
