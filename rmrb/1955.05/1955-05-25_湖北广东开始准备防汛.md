Hubei and Guangdong Begin Flood Prevention Preparations

The water levels of the Yangtze and Han Rivers have begun to rise steadily, and various places along the river in Hubei Province have begun flood prevention preparations. Shishou, Jianli, and Honghu counties along the Yangtze River, and Tianmen, Hanchuan, and Hanyang counties along the Han River, organized forces in early May to conduct preliminary surveys and inspections of the dikes after repairs. They identified dangerous sections and took measures to cultivate and reinforce some sections of the dikes that did not meet standards or had poor dike quality. The counties in the Xiaogan area conducted a comprehensive inventory of the flood prevention materials scattered in various places last year and began to order new materials. Hanchuan County has already ordered 150,000 grass bags. The culvert gates on the dikes are undergoing pre-flood inspections and repairs. The flood prevention telephone lines destroyed by floods last year are being erected intensively. The telephone lines from Shashi through Jianli to Honghu have been erected for 146 kilometers, and another 90 kilometers are under construction. The flood prevention telephone lines along the middle reaches of the Han River have been fully restored. In order to make full preparations for flood prevention and ensure a safe passage through the flood season, the Hubei Provincial People's Committee held a provincial flood prevention meeting in mid-May, implemented the instructions of the Ministry of Water Resources on flood prevention, and deployed this year's flood prevention tasks.

    Guangdong Province has now entered the rainy flood season, and the water levels of the rivers are gradually rising. The Water Conservancy Department has issued instructions, requiring all localities to do a good job in dismantling dams, restoring dikes, preventing floods, and storing and conserving water.
    The flood prevention headquarters along the rivers have prepared flood prevention materials and mobilized the masses to guard the dangerous sections. Some areas have successively repaired the breaches in the dikes that were created during the drought resistance period and dismantled the dams blocking the river.

　  湖北广东开始准备防汛
    长江、汉水的水位开始稳步上升，湖北省沿江各地已进行防汛准备工作。沿长江的石首、监利、洪湖和沿汉水的天门、汉川、汉阳等县，五月初即组织力量，对检修后的堤防，进行了初步的普测和检查，鉴定了险工险段，对部分堤段堤身不合标准或堤质不良的，随即进行了培修和加固措施。孝感专区各县对去年散存各地的防汛器材，进行了全面的清点，并开始预订新的器材，汉川县已经订购了十五万草包。各地堤上的剅闸，正在进行汛前检查和整修。去年被洪水摧毁的防汛电线，正在紧张架设，从沙市经监利到洪湖境内的电线已经架好了一百四十六公里，尚有九十公里正在架设，沿汉水中游的防汛电线，均已全面恢复。为全面作好防汛准备工作，保证安全渡过汛期，湖北省人民委员会已在五月中旬召开全省防汛会议，贯彻了中央水利部对防汛的指示，布置了今年的防汛任务。（胡九皋）
    广东省目前已进入雨季汛期，各江河水位逐渐上涨，水利厅已发出指示；要求各地做好拆坝、复堤、防汛和蓄水保水工作。
    现沿江河各地防汛指挥部都准备了防汛器材和动员群众守护险段。有的地区纷纷将抗旱期间破堤的缺口修补和将堵塞河水的拦河坝拆除。
