　　Record of the Yunnan Minority Nationalities Cultural Relics Exhibition
　　By our reporter Liu Shiping
　　The Yuangtong Temple in Kunming is now blooming with vibrant roses. Every day, groups of people flock there to visit the Minority Nationalities Cultural Relics Exhibition. This exhibition is organized by the Yunnan Provincial Museum. From its official opening on March 19th to April 17th, in less than a month, the number of visitors has reached over 44,000.

　　The exhibition is divided into three parts. The first part mainly introduces the distribution of minority nationalities in Yunnan and their natural environment. In front of a map set up with glass frames and electric lights, when the button is pressed, various colors appear on the map, allowing you to clearly see that the Dai people live in the plains along the Lancang River in southern Yunnan; the Kawa people live on the Kawa Mountains adjacent to Burma, as well as the Lahu people in Lancang and other places. Looking east from the Lancang River, the Hani people live along the Ailao Mountains of the Hong River; further east to Hekou, which is the lowest altitude area in Yunnan, only about 100 meters, connected to our neighboring country Vietnam, where the Yao people also live. Looking north again, on the west bank of the Nujiang River, which runs through Yunnan from north to south, the Dai and Jingpo people live. The top of Gaoligong Mountain, a section of the Hengduan Mountains parallel to the Nujiang River, extends into the northwest corner of Xikang, and there is also a Tibetan residential area. Along the Xikang border to the banks of the Nujiang and Jinsha Rivers, live the Lisu and Naxi people. From Lijiang on the south bank of the Jinsha River, along the highway to Dali, the Hui and Bai people live there. From Dali to the east, all the way to Kunming; and from Kunming, south to Lunan, Mile, Eshan, east to Qujing and other places, northeast to Zhaotong, southeast to Wenshan area, the Yi and Miao people live together or intermingle. There are also other nationalities mixed with the Han nationality. Here are also displayed specimens of the endless mineral resources and abundant flora and fauna specimens of the minority nationality areas.

　　From charts to specimens, after viewing the exhibits in the first part, we realize that the minority nationality population in Yunnan accounts for about one-third of the total population of the province. They live together or intermingle in the inland and border areas, plains and mountains, where there are magnificent mountains and rivers, beautiful scenery, fertile fields, abundant resources and huge hydropower reserves. The climate and soil are also suitable for the breeding of various plants and animals. These superior conditions will play a significant role in the future development of all nationalities and the great socialist construction of the motherland.

　　The second part introduces the languages, clothing and jewelry, embroidery and brocade weaving, music and dance, painting and sculpture, revolutionary cultural relics, daily necessities and production tools of eighteen nationalities. This is not all, but only what the comrades of the museum collected in the three months from August to early November last year, divided into three groups, going deep into Guishan and Xishan, one of the guerrilla war base areas in Yunnan during the Liberation War, as well as the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region, and the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region. Some are also cultural relics collected by the Yunnan Nationalities Institute and private collectors.

　　From this part of the exhibition, people see the exquisite handicrafts of all nationalities. Whether it is the "scriptures" written by the Dai people on palm leaves, or the intricately patterned brocade quilt covers and clothing materials woven from bamboo hand looms, as well as complex pattern paper-cuts and gold and silver jewelry, they all demonstrate their excellent culture and art. There are also the Hani people's wood-carved "chicken feather charcoal letters", which they use to convey orders in emergencies through this simple form of correspondence. The Yi people's drawnwork embroidery, in various styles and dazzling arrays, highly demonstrates the intelligence of the Yi people. Among the exhibits of the Jingpo people, there is a fire starter made of cow horn, which many people praise. The Tibetan carvings and paintings are vivid and lifelike. The Arhat statues painted on Bodhi leaves with mineral pigments, as well as the colored mandala, are still bright and dazzling even after many years. Other items include ivory bracelets, copper toad wine bottles, bone carvings and clay Buddha statues, painted lacquer boxes; as well as the long narrative poem "Ashima" sung by the Sani people about love, the large three-stringed instrument used in Ashi dances, the Miao people's lusheng, etc., all of which show the rich and colorful culture and art of the minority nationalities.

　　Not only in culture and art, but also in revolutionary cultural relics, the history of the struggles of the minority nationalities can be seen. For example, the heroic struggle of Bi Hengguang, a patriotic Sani youth and Communist Party member from Pucao Village in the Guishan area, who participated in the guerrilla struggle before liberation and was arrested and imprisoned in 1948, remaining unyielding until his death; and the historical events of Du Wenxiu leading the Hui people and farmers of various nationalities in Dali to revolt and resist the oppression of the Qing Dynasty's feudal rule, all make people see that the fraternal nationalities are not only hardworking nationalities, but also brave nationalities.

　　All those who have visited this exhibition have praised the excellent art and brave spirit of the fraternal nationalities in the comment book. In the past, during the reactionary rule, their excellent culture was severely damaged and could not be developed. Only in the new China can their culture have the opportunity to develop and meet the broad masses. Many representatives of the minority nationalities, after visiting, excitedly and gratefully said, "Chairman Mao is the sun in winter and the rain in summer," caring for their culture and art, and valuing their history of struggle; at the same time, they repeatedly said that their national cultural relics are still numerous, and only a small part is exhibited here. They all want to go back and collect more cultural relics of their own nationality and send them to the museum.

　　The third part introduces the achievements of the people of all nationalities in politics, economy, and culture under the brilliant light of the Chinese Communist Party's policy on nationalities after liberation. First of all, all nationalities have achieved equality in politics and implemented national regional autonomy. Now there are already four prefectural-level and six county-level autonomous regions in the province. The minority nationalities have been freed from thousands of years of oppression and exploitation, enjoying freedom and equality, and managing their own affairs.

　　Here are also exhibited materials from two typical villages, which are praised as model villages.

　　Xinfacun in Yiliang County, Qujing Prefecture, is a village inhabited by the Sani people. After they were allocated land in 1952, they organized to develop production and were awarded the honorary title of "High-Yield Model Village". In 1953, under the threat of serious natural disasters, the whole village again achieved a bumper harvest and established two permanent mutual aid teams. Last year, all the farmers in the village had organized agricultural production cooperatives. They changed the old habits of "slash-and-burn agriculture" and "extensive planting with meager harvest", fixed cultivated land, dug ditches and built dams, built water conservancy projects, accumulated fertilizer, weeded, and learned deep plowing and careful cultivation. Production has increased year by year, and life has improved. The whole village has 38 households with 92 laborers. In 1951, they only harvested 98,000 jin of rice, but last year they harvested 169,150 jin. In the past, there were only 20-odd cattle, but now there are more than 170 cattle.

　　Another is Hongha Village in Laozhai Township, Xichou County, Wenshan Prefecture, a health model village inhabited by the Nong and Han nationalities. Before liberation, half of the village was often sick. After liberation, the patriotic health campaign was launched, diseases were reduced, the mortality rate was lowered, and the birth rate was significantly increased. In terms of production, it increased by 120% in 1954 compared to 1952, and by 55% compared to 1953 (including sideline production). In 1954, 28 out of the 31 households in the village sold a total of 16,400 jin of surplus grain.

　　With the development of production, cultural education has also developed accordingly. More than 1,000 primary and secondary schools have been established in minority nationality areas throughout the province, and textbooks and publications in national languages have been compiled and printed.

　　Here are also exhibited the rich native products of the minority nationality areas. In those overlapping mountains, there are countless non-ferrous metals and other mineral deposits. In the dense primeval forests, there are various trees that you have never seen or heard of. There are also many tropical plants, such as rubber, coffee, cinchona, tea, camphor, ramie, tung oil, as well as various tropical fruits such as coconuts, pineapples, and bananas. The famous Yunnan-Guizhou medicinal materials, such as notoginseng, cordyceps, fritillaria, coptis, musk, etc., are countless. In addition, there are many things to eat, such as Xuanwei ham, Lunan milk cake, and the famous chicken fir mushrooms. Around the exhibits of abundant plants, medicinal materials, and mineral deposits, there are also various animal skins such as tigers, leopards, deer, and muntjacs hanging on the walls.

　　All those who have visited the exhibition feel as if they have taken a vivid class in national education. Some people were deceived by reactionary propaganda in the past and mistakenly believed that minority nationality areas were "barren lands" and "malaria zones," and that minority nationalities were extremely "backward." However, from the materials and objects exhibited at the exhibition, they saw the rich and colorful culture and art of the minority nationalities, saw the intelligence of the working people of all nationalities, and learned that the minority nationality areas contain abundant mineral resources and primeval forests; these places also produce various delicious fruits and a wide variety of local products. Of course, due to the long-term oppression and destruction by reactionary rulers in the past, the minority nationalities are still relatively backward. But the materials exhibited tell us that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the economic and cultural undertakings of the minority nationalities have made great progress in the past few years. Their future is infinitely bright and splendid.

　　记云南少数民族文物展览
　　本报记者  刘时平
    昆明圆通寺现正盛开着鲜艳的玫瑰花。每天都有成群结队的人流，拥向那里参观少数民族文物展览。这个展览是云南省博物馆举办的。从三月十九日正式开放，到四月十七日，不到一个月，参观的人数已有四万四千多人。
    展览的内容分成三部分。第一部分主要是介绍云南少数民族分布情况及自然环境。在一个用玻璃镜框和电灯装设的地图前面，电钮一开，图上现出了各种颜色，让你一目了然地看到在云南的南部，沿着澜沧江两岸的平坝子里，聚居着傣族；同缅甸相邻的佧瓦山上住着佧瓦族，还有澜沧等地的拉祜族。从澜沧江向东看，沿红河的哀牢山边聚居着哈尼族；再往东到了河口，那是云南海拔最低的地方，只有百公尺左右，它同我们的邻邦越南相连，那里又是瑶族。再向北看，在纵贯云南南北的怒江西岸，聚居着傣族和景颇族。同怒江平行的横断山脉的高黎贡山的顶端，伸入西康的西北角，还有藏族聚居区。沿西康边境来到怒江和金沙江沿岸，住着傈僳族和纳西族。从金沙江南岸的丽江，沿公路到了大理，那里住着回族和民家族。从大理向东，直到昆明；再从昆明，南到路南、弥勒、峨山，东到曲靖等地，东北到昭通，东南到文山一带，聚居或杂居着彝族和苗族。还有其它民族同汉族杂居在一起。这里还陈列着少数民族地区蕴藏的无尽矿藏的标本和丰富的动植物标本。
    从图表到标本，看完了第一部分的展览品，使我们认识到：在云南少数民族人口约占全省总人口三分之一，他们聚居或杂居在内地和边疆的坝区和山区，那里有壮丽的山川，优美的风景，肥沃的田野，丰富的资源和巨大的水力蕴藏。气候，土壤也适于各种动植物的繁殖。这些优越的条件，对于各民族的发展前途和祖国伟大的社会主义建设，都将起着很大的作用。
    第二部分介绍了十八个民族的语言、衣服首饰、刺绣织锦、音乐舞蹈、绘画雕刻、革命文物、生活用具和生产工具等。这还不是全部，只是博物馆的同志们，在去年八月到十一月初的三个月里，分成三个组，深入到解放战争时云南的游击战争根据地之一——圭山、西山，以及德宏傣族、景颇族自治区、红河哈尼族自治区搜集来的，还有一部分是云南民族学院和私人收藏的文物。
    从这一部分展览品中，人们看到了各民族的精致工艺品。不管是傣族用贝叶写的“经书”，或用竹制的手工织布机织出来的花纹精细的锦绣被面和服装料，以及复杂的图案剪花、金银首饰，都表现了他们的优秀的文化和艺术。还有哈尼族用木刻的“鸡毛火炭信”，他们用这种简单的书信方式，在紧急时传达命令。彝族的挑花刺绣，各式各样，琳琅满目，高度地表现了彝族人民的聪明智慧。在景颇族的展览品中，有一个用牛角做的取火器，许多人看了都很称赞。藏族的雕刻绘画，生动活现，他们用矿物质颜料在菩提树叶上画的罗汉像，以及彩绘的坛城，虽然经过多少年了，还是鲜艳夺目。其它用象牙做的手镯，铜铸的虾蟆酒瓶，骨雕和泥塑的佛像，画花的漆盒；还有撒尼歌唱爱情的长篇叙事诗“阿诗玛”，阿西舞蹈时的大三弦，苗族的葫芦笙等等，这些都显示了少数民族丰富多采的文化艺术。
    不仅在文化艺术方面，在革命文物中也可以看出少数民族的斗争历史。如圭山区蒲草村的撒尼爱国青年、共产党员毕恒光，在解放前参加游击斗争，一九四八年被捕入狱，至死不屈的英勇斗争，还有历史上杜文秀在大理领导回民和各族农民起义，反抗清朝封建统治压迫的斗争事迹，都使人们看出兄弟民族不仅是勤劳的民族，而且是勇敢的民族。
    所有参观过这个展览的人，在意见簿上都绝口称赞兄弟民族的优秀艺术和勇敢精神。过去，在反动统治时期，他们的优秀文化横遭摧残，得不到发展。只有在新中国，他们的文化才获得发展的机会，才能和广大的群众见面。许多少数民族的代表参观后，一面兴奋地感激地说：“毛主席是冬天的太阳、夏天的雨”，关怀他们的文化艺术，重视他们的斗争历史；一面口口声声说他们民族的文物还有的是，放在这里展览的只是一小部分，他们都想回去把本民族的文物，多搜集一点，送到博物馆来。
    第三部分是介绍解放后在中国共产党民族政策的光辉照耀下，各族人民在政治、经济、文化各方面的成就。首先是各民族在政治上得到了平等，实行了民族区域自治。现在全省已有四个专区级、六个县级的自治区。少数民族摆脱了千百年来的压迫、剥削，享受着自由、平等的权利，自己管理着自己的事。
    这里还展出了两个典型的村庄的材料，这是人们称赞的模范村。
    在曲靖专区宜良县的新发村，是撒尼人聚居的
  一个村庄。他们从一九五二年分得土地后，组织起来发展生产，得到了“丰产模范村”的光荣称号。一九五三年在严重的自然灾害威胁下，全村又获得丰收，并建立了两个常年固定的互助组。去年全村的农户已经组织起农业生产合作社。他们改变了过去“刀耕火种”、“广种薄收”的旧习惯，固定了耕地，开沟打坝，兴修水利、积肥、除草，学会了深耕细作，历年增产，生活得到改善。全村三十八户人家，有九十二个劳动力，在一九五一年时，只收稻谷九万八千斤，去年收获了十六万九千一百五十斤。过去只有二十几条牛，现在已有一百七十多条牛。
    另一个是文山专区西畴县老寨乡，侬族和汉族居住的卫生模范村——哄哈村。解放前，全村有一半人经常害病，解放后开展了爱国卫生运动，疾病减少，死亡率降低，出生率显著提高；在生产方面，一九五四年比一九五二年增加十二成，比一九五三年增加五成半（包括副业）。全村三十一家人，一九五四年有二十八家人共卖了余粮一万六千四百斤。
    随着生产的发展，文化教育也相适应地发展了。全省少数民族地区已建立中小学校一千多所，还编印了民族文字课本和书刊。
    这里还展出了少数民族地区的富饶的土特产。在那万山重叠的山岭间，蕴藏着无数的有色金属和其它矿藏。在那密密层层的原始森林，有你从来没有见过或者听过的各种树木。还有许多热带植物，如橡胶、咖啡、金鸡纳霜、茶叶、樟脑、紫梗、桐麻，以及椰子、菠萝、香蕉等各种热带水果。闻名全国的云贵药材，如三七、虫草、贝母、黄连、麝香等等更是数不胜数。除此而外，吃的东西也很多，如宣威火腿，路南乳饼和驰名的鸡棕等等。就在那些丰富的植物、药材和矿藏的展览品周围的墙上，还挂着虎、豹、鹿、麂子等等各种兽皮。
    所有参观过展览的人，都感觉到如同上了一次生动的民族教育课。有些人过去受反动宣传的欺骗，误认为少数民族地区是“不毛之地”，是“瘴气区”，少数民族极端“落后”。但是，从展览会展出的材料和实物中，他们看到了少数民族丰富多采的文化艺术，看到了各族劳动人民的聪明和智慧，知道了少数民族地区蕴藏着丰富的矿产和原始森林；在这些地方还出产各种美味的水果和多种多样的土特产。当然，由于过去反动统治者的长期压迫和摧残，少数民族还是比较落后的。但是展出的材料告诉我们：在共产党的领导下，几年来少数民族的经济、文化事业已经有了长足的发展。他们的前途是无限光辉灿烂的。
