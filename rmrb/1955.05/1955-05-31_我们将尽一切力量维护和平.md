We Chinese women always link our struggle for our own rights and for the independence of our motherland with the struggle of women all over the world. We are elated by the achievements of women around the world. We are filled with fervent hope for the upcoming World Mothers' Congress. We want to do our best to make our relationship with women from all over the world closer, to deepen our mutual understanding, and to make our mutual understanding and respect more solid. Because friendly relations are an important contribution to the cause of world peace.

We women demand a peaceful and tranquil world, because in any war, women are always the first and most severely affected victims. Therefore, we stand at the forefront of the struggle, striving to improve the living conditions of mankind and to raise all of us, without exception, in terms of social status to a level commensurate with the level of human scientific knowledge.

Needless to say, the progress of mankind and all peoples, the defense of peace, and the defense of the rights of women and children are closely linked together. If there is no progress in defending the rights of women and children, then the progress of mankind and the nation is impossible, and the defense of peace is also impossible. But we are clearly aware that the success of the struggle to demand that the rights of women and children be recognized and implemented will not come by itself. This means that we women must be particularly united against the heinous plans for atomic war that some people are clamoring for almost every day. We are at the forefront of the struggle to stop atomic war. We must constantly educate and struggle for all that is rightfully ours. Only by carrying out this kind of activity can we be more likely to move forward continuously, ensuring that we play an increasingly expanded role in the struggle for the progress of our respective countries and for world peace.

On behalf of Chinese women, I wish women all over the world—mothers of all nations—great achievements in the struggle for their own rights and the rights of their children. We will work with you to do everything possible to maintain peace in Asia and the world.

Strive for the continuous progress of all women in life and work!
Strive for the continuous growth of the forces of world peace!

    我们将尽一切力量维护和平
    宋庆龄
    中国妇女总是把她们争取自己的权利，争取祖国独立的斗争和全世界妇女的斗争联系起来的。我们为世界妇女的成就而欢欣鼓舞。我们为即将召开的世界母亲大会而充满着热烈的希望。我们要尽力使我们和世界各国妇女的关系更加密切，使我们相知更深，使我们相互间的了解和尊重更加牢固。因为友好关系对于世界和平事业是一个重要的贡献。
    我们妇女要求一个和平宁静的世界，因为在任何战争中，妇女总是最先和最沉重的受害者。因此，我们是站在斗争的最前线，为改善人类生活条件，为把我们自己全体毫无例外地在社会地位方面提高到与人类科学知识水平相称的高度而奋斗。
    不用说，人类和各国人民的进步，保卫和平和保卫妇女儿童的权利都是紧密相连结成一体的。如果在保卫妇女儿童的权利方面没有进展，那么，人类和国家的进步是不可能的，保卫和平也是不可能的。但是我们清楚地知道，要求妇女儿童权利获得承认并付之于实施的斗争的成功是不会自己来的。这就是说我们妇女格外必须团结一致反对某些人几乎每天叫嚣的原子战争的罪恶计划。我们是在阻止原子战争斗争的最前线。我们必须为理当属于我们的一切而不断地进行教育工作和斗争。只有进行这种活动，我们才更有可能不断前进，保证我们在争取我们各个国家的进步和争取世界和平的斗争中发挥日益扩大的作用。
    我代表中国妇女祝全世界的妇女——各国的母亲们在争取她们自己的和她们儿童的权利的斗争中获得伟大的成就。我们将和你们一起尽一切力量维护亚洲和世界的和平。
    为全体妇女在生活和工作中不断前进而奋斗！
    为世界和平力量的不断增长而奋斗！
