Severely Punish the Counter-Revolutionary Hu Feng
　　Zhu Xuefan
After reading the "People's Daily" reports of "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group" and the second batch of materials, one can no longer suppress the anger in one's heart!

A criminal anti-Party and anti-people group actually disguised itself and hid in the revolutionary ranks for a long time to engage in anti-Party and counter-revolutionary activities, using covert methods in an attempt to destroy the revolutionary achievements obtained by the Chinese people through years of struggle. Hu Feng, this criminal counter-revolutionary, must be severely punished by the people!

Look at what Hu Feng said in his secret letters to the members of his criminal group! He cursed the Party's leadership as "zombie rule," viciously slandered the CCP Central Committee, which leads the people of the whole country, as a "board of directors," called revolutionary literary writers "robbers and swindlers," "flies and mosquitoes," and wantonly vilified and insulted the Party's care and help for him before and after liberation. Is there any behavior more egregious than this? He vilified Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as a "booklet treated as a 'totem'." In Hu Feng's heart, everything revolutionary and progressive is what he hates. A wolf in sheep's clothing! How insidious and vicious! With Marxism-Leninism on his lips, he was secretly launching a frenzied attack on the Party and the people.

Anyone who reads the materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party group can understand that Hu Feng is by no means an intellectual with "petty-bourgeois revolutionary nature and position" as he said in his "My Self-Criticism"; nor are his mistakes merely "narrow sectarian sentiments." He is a thorough anti-Party, anti-people counter-revolutionary. He wants to "seek rebirth in suffering, everything is for the cause, for a greater future." May I ask what "cause" he is referring to? What is the "greater future"? Isn't it Chiang Kai-shek's restoration? Isn't it imperialism returning to China to slaughter the Chinese people again? We only need to look at how he sent these secret letters to understand what he was doing. He used many false names and surnames, falsely used the name of the newspaper to send letters, and used various codes and hidden languages in the letters. What is the difference between these sneaky practices and those of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents? Without citing many examples, the facts are very obvious: Hu Feng's group is an organized, planned, and concretely acting counter-revolutionary group.

After his criminal activities were first exposed, he even妄想唆使 his group members to retreat on the surface, cover himself, and attempt to continue to lie dormant, waiting for an opportunity to act. If such a person is not punished, how can the anger of the people across the country be appeased!

Hu Feng is in no way qualified to be a people's representative. All his positions must be revoked immediately, and his political background and all the conspiracies of his counter-revolutionary activities must be thoroughly clarified!

The Hu Feng anti-Party and anti-people group has been exposed. Everyone who has colluded with Hu Feng should turn back as soon as possible, stand up to fight against Hu Feng's reactionary behavior, and settle accounts with Hu Feng's crimes against the Party and the people.

At the same time, the Hu Feng anti-Party incident has given us a very profound lesson. Counter-revolutionaries will use all kinds of different despicable means to undermine the people's revolutionary cause. They will pretend to be progressive, put on the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, sneak into the revolutionary ranks, steal documents, inquire about information, and conspire to expand their criminal group in order to achieve the goal of conspiratorial sabotage. This lesson not only educates the fighters on the literary and art front, but also requires all state organs, enterprises, and organizations to face this incident squarely, raise revolutionary vigilance, and always beware of the enemy's tricks.

    严厉制裁反革命分子胡风
　　朱学范
    读了“人民日报”揭载的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”和第二批材料之后，使人再也抑压不住内心的愤怒！
    一个反党反人民的罪恶集团，竟然伪装地长期隐藏在革命队伍里进行反党反革命的勾当，用隐蔽的方法，企图破坏中国人民多年来斗争获得的革命成果。胡风，这个罪恶的反革命分子，必须受到人民的严厉制裁！
    看胡风在给他的罪恶集团分子的密信中说些什么吧！把党的领导咒骂为“僵尸统治”，把领导着全国人民的中共中央恶毒地污蔑为“董事会”，指革命的文艺作家是“强盗和骗子”、“苍蝇蚊子”，把解放前后党对他的关心和帮助，肆意地诋毁、辱骂，还有比这种行为更恶劣的吗？把毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”污蔑为“被当作了‘图腾’的小册子”。在胡风的心里，一切革命和进步都是他所仇恨的。一个披着羊皮的豺狼！多么阴险恶毒！嘴里念着马克思列宁主义，暗地里却在向党向人民猖狂进攻。
    任何人读了关于胡风反党集团的材料，都可以明白胡风决不是像他在“我的自我批判”中所说的什么具有“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”的知识分子；他的错误也决不是什么“狭隘的宗派情绪”。他是一个道道地地的反党、反人民的反革命分子。他要“在忍受中求得重生，一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来”，试问他所指的“事业”是什么呢？“更远大的未来”是什么呢？难道不是蒋介石的复辟吗？不是帝国主义重新回到中国来屠杀中国人民吗？我们只要看一看他是用什么方式寄发这些密信就可以明白他是在干什么了。他用很多假名假姓，假用报社的名义寄发信件，在信里使用各种各样的代号和隐语，这些鬼祟的做法，同蒋介石特务分子有什么两样？不用多举例子，事实很明显地放着：胡风的集团，是有组织的、有计划的、有具体行动的反革命集团。
    当他的罪恶勾当刚被揭露之后，他还妄想唆使他的集团分子表面退却，掩护自己，企图继续潜伏，伺机而动。这样的人，如不制裁，怎能平服全国人民的愤怒！
    胡风丝毫没有资格再当人民代表，他所担任的一切职务必须立即撤销，他的政治背景，反革命活动的全部阴谋，必须彻底搞清！
    胡风反党反人民集团被揭发了。一切同胡风有勾搭的人都应该及早回头，站出来对胡风的反动行为作斗争，清算胡风的反党反人民的罪恶。
    同时，在胡风这一反党事件中，给了我们很深刻的教训。反革命分子是会用各种各样不同的卑鄙手段来破坏人民革命事业的，他们会伪装进步，披起马克思列宁主义的外衣，钻进革命的队伍，盗窃文件，探听情报，阴谋扩大他们的罪恶集团，以达到阴谋破坏的目的。这一教训，不仅教育了文艺战线上的战士们，在一切国家机关、企业、团体里，都必须正视这一事件，提高革命警惕，时刻提防敌人的诡计。　（原载“工人日报”）
