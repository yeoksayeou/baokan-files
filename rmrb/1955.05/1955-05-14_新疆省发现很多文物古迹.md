Xinjiang Province Gazetteer Museum Preparatory Office and Xinjiang Province Cultural Relics Group were officially established on May 11.

Since the establishment of the preparatory bodies of these two units in March 1954, they have conducted a series of investigations and research in the Tarim Basin and both north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, discovering twenty-two ancient city ruins and fourteen "Mazars" (ancient tombs), and investigated 840 stone caves in the Kizil Thousand Buddha Caves. They also focused on Kashgar in southern Xinjiang to carry out cultural relics surveys, discovering various historical books in Uyghur, Persian, and Arabic, as well as the "Silk Road" used to transport silk westward during the Han and Tang dynasties in China. They also discovered twenty-four kinds of ancient mechanical models and maps, and more than sixty kinds of minerals. In order to mobilize people of all ethnic groups to assist in collecting and preserving the motherland's cultural and historical heritage, cultural relics and ancient sites exhibitions were held in Yili, Kashgar, Turpan, Aksu and other places, with an audience of 150,000 people.
