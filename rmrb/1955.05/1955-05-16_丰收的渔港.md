　　A Bountiful Fishing Port
　　Sansha Town, in Xiapu County, the main fishing port in northeastern Fujian Province, is now immersed in the joy of a bountiful spring catch. At night, looking out from Lion Ball Mountain on the harbor, the fishing lights flicker in the waves, and the cuttlefish temporary processing sheds of the state-owned aquatic products company and the supply and marketing cooperative, as well as the streets, are very lively.

　　Since the beginning of the spring fishing season in early April, the fishing boats of the "Dongfanghong" and "Heping" fishing production cooperatives, as well as some fishing mutual aid groups, in Sansha Town have been chasing shark schools day and night in the outer sea. In one month, they have caught more than 40 large sharks, each weighing around 5,000 jin, and extracted more than 46,000 jin of shark liver, which was sold to the local state-owned Xiamen Fish Liver Oil Factory. The shark output this month has exceeded the total shark catch for the entire last year by one time. Accompanying the shark season is the cuttlefish season. In one month, the town caught 1.28 million jin of cuttlefish, equivalent to eight times the total cuttlefish production of the entire last year. Thousands of fishermen's families are working day and night in the cuttlefish processing sheds to make fresh cuttlefish into dried cuttlefish, ready to be sold to various places at home and abroad.

　　Sansha Town's fish production has been increasing year by year. Last year, the total output was already double that of 1950, and this year it will greatly exceed last year. According to statistics: since the spring fishing season, the average income of fishermen in Sansha Town has reached more than 350 yuan per household, and their living standards have been greatly improved.

　　丰收的渔港
    福建省东北部的主要渔港——霞浦县三沙镇，现在正沉浸在春汛大丰收的欢乐中。夜晚从港畔狮球山上了望，港湾里点点渔火随波荡动，国营水产公司和供销合作社的收购站的墨鱼临时加工寮和市街都很热闹。
    从四月初春汛开始以来，三沙镇“东方红”和“和平”两个渔业生产合作社以及一些渔业互助组的渔船，日夜在外海追捕鲨鱼群，一个月中他们已捕获四十多条重量都在五千斤上下的大鲨鱼，剖出了四万六千多斤鱼肝，卖给地方国营厦门鱼肝油厂。这个月的鲨鱼产量超过去年全年捕鲨量的一倍。和鲨鱼汛并来的是墨鱼汛。一个月中，全镇捕到的墨鱼达一百二十八万斤，等于去年全年墨鱼总产量的八倍。上千个渔民家属在墨鱼加工寮中夜以继日地把鲜墨鱼制成墨鱼干，准备销到国内外各地。
    三沙镇的鱼产量逐年上升，去年总产量已相当于一九五零年的一倍，今年又将大大超过去年。据统计：自春汛以来，三沙镇渔民平均每户收入达三百五十多元，生活大大改善了。  （新华社）
