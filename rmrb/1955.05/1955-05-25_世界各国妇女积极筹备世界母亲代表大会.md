Many women's organizations and women's departments of trade unions in Japan recently held a meeting in Tokyo, deciding to convene the Japanese Mothers' Congress in Tokyo from June 7th to 9th, and decided to widely mobilize women from all walks of life to combine the opposition to atomic war with preparatory activities.

Women all over Italy are sending representatives to participate in a national demonstration to protect children to be held in Cassino on June 1st. Four hundred representatives of women's organizations in the districts of Calcutta, India, recently held a march, and the representatives held a meeting and passed a resolution against the use of atomic weapons and for world peace. Women in the United States are actively supporting the signature campaign against atomic war launched by the American Peace Crusade.
