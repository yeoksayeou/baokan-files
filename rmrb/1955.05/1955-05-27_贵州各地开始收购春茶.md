　  Guizhou Begins Purchasing Spring Tea in Various Regions

    Guizhou Province has begun purchasing spring tea. Before the new tea came on the market, the purchasing departments dispatched twenty-six cadres to inspect and assist in the purchasing work. More than eighty tea grading personnel were trained in the main tea producing areas. In tea producing areas such as Anshun, Zhenyuan, and Renhuai, more than 1,900 dan of export tea from farmers were pre-purchased, with advance payments of more than 24,000 yuan, which solved the difficulties of tea farmers in spring plowing and production. From the beginning of April to May 5th, according to incomplete statistics: the province has purchased more than 4,000 dan of tea, an increase of 75.8% compared with the same period last year.

　  贵州各地开始收购春茶
    贵州省开始收购春茶。在新茶上市以前，收购部门先后派出了二十六个干部，检查和协助收购工作。并在主要茶区训练了八十多名茶叶评级人员。在安顺、镇远、仁怀等茶区预购了农民的外销茶叶一千九百多担、预付人民币二万四千多元，解决了茶农春耕生产中的困难。从四月初开始收购到五月五日止，据不完全统计：全省已收购茶叶四千多担，比去年同时期增加了百分之七十五点八。
