      The Asian-African Conference Opens
    Monday, April 18th
    This is an extraordinary day. The Asian-African Conference, which so many people in the world have been anticipating for so long, is about to open today.
    Every household has hung the red and white Indonesian flag, and the five-star red flag is also hung in front of the houses where overseas Chinese live. It seems that the people of Bandung have all come to the streets, and there are crowds of people everywhere.
    Asia-Africa Street has been closed to traffic since early morning. Indonesian soldiers in green uniforms and white helmets are stationed on both sides, and outside them, layers of people stand shoulder to shoulder. As cars passed through them one after another, heading towards the Independence Building, it seemed that everyone was holding their breath, as people often feel when waiting for the most important events.
    The meeting was scheduled to begin at nine o'clock, but by eight o'clock, the guest and press seats in the conference hall were already full.
    The people in the venue, like the people outside the venue, waited impatiently for the arrival of the delegations from various countries.
    At almost nine o'clock, applause and cheers came from outside the door, and delegations from various countries entered the conference hall one after another.
    All kinds of costumes were displayed before your eyes.
    Wearing embroidered caps and wrapped in colorful silk were Liberians or Gold Coasters. Wearing gauze caps and mandarin jackets were Burmese. Wearing white gauze headscarves held by gold hoops and black gauze robes were Saudi Arabians. Wearing thin gauze embroidered shirts and small bow ties were Filipinos. Wrapped in thick purple woolen robes and wearing waist knives were Yemenis. The Turks' hats were red, the Indonesians' hats were black, and the Egyptians' hats were white-edged and red-centered, even though they were all Muslims. Similarly, the Chinese wore high-collared uniforms with fewer and shorter buttons, while the Indians wore uniforms with more buttons that reached their knees. …
    In people's memory, has there ever been an international conference that brought together so many representatives of different nationalities, races, colors, languages, cultures... and at the same time had not even one representative from a colonial country?
    No, this is the first conference of its kind in history. May everyone bless its success.
    At about 9:15, the Indonesian national anthem was played outside the door, and Indonesian President Sukarno and Vice President Hatta, guided by the Prime Ministers of the five initiating countries of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan, entered the venue.
    President Sukarno was invited to deliver the opening speech to the conference. In his 50-minute speech, he evoked many common emotions throughout the audience.
    He said: "As I look around this hall and at the distinguished guests gathered here, I am deeply moved. This is the first intercontinental conference of colored people in human history."
    He said: "Great changes have taken place in the past few years. Many nations and countries have awakened from centuries of slumber. … Irresistible forces have swept across two continents."
    He said: "We are all united by things that are more important than what superficially divides us. For example, we are united by a common hatred of colonialism in whatever form it appears. We are united by a common hatred of racism. We are united by a common determination to uphold and stabilize world peace."
    He said: "I hope that the conference will prove the fact that we, the leaders of Asia and Africa, realize that Asia and Africa can only prosper if they unite. … I hope that it will prove that Asia and Africa have been reborn, and a new Asia and a new Africa have been born. Our task is first to achieve understanding with each other, from which will arise greater respect for each other, and from respect will arise collective action. Brothers and sisters, let us remember that for all this, we Asians and Africans must unite."
    President Sukarno ended his speech in warm applause from the audience. The five Prime Ministers escorted him and Vice President Hatta out of the venue. The meeting then adjourned temporarily.
    After the meeting resumed at 11:45, Ali Sastroamidjojo was unanimously elected as the Chairman of the Asian-African Conference. He then began his speech amidst applause.
    Sastroamidjojo quoted the Bogor Conference communiqué to explain the purpose of the Asian-African Conference: (A) to promote goodwill and cooperation among Asian and African countries; (B) to discuss social, economic and cultural issues and relations; (C) to consider problems of national sovereignty, racism and colonialism; (D) to view the position of Asia and Africa and their peoples in the world today and the contribution they can make to the promotion of world peace and cooperation. He said, "Let these purposes be the guide in our discussions." He particularly emphasized the responsibility of the conference to make a solid contribution to the promotion of world peace and cooperation. He concluded by saying: "If we can express in no uncertain terms our desire and determination to strive for peace..., then this conference will have accomplished its historic task."
    The opening ceremony of the Asian-African Conference thus ended after Sastroamidjojo's speech. Afterwards, the heads of delegations held a closed meeting. It was not until 1:30 that the delegations left the Independence Building.
    The Asian-African Conference, which Western newspapers had speculated would not be able to open, finally opened victoriously. Representatives from twenty-nine countries have sat down together to discuss common problems.
    As the delegates walked down the marble steps of the Independence Building one after another, the people who had been standing on Asia-Africa Street all morning jumped up and shouted madly.
    They learned everything about the meeting from the loudspeakers installed on the street. Their hearts were closely linked to the venue. The people were non-attending participants in the Asian-African Conference.
    Harmony and unity were the overriding themes of the morning meeting, but everyone knew that the future was not without twists and turns. The test will come in the afternoon meeting, where delegations from various countries will begin to speak. Only from these speeches can it be known to what extent the common goals of the conference just announced will be accepted.
    The speakers at today's afternoon meeting were: Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia, John Kotelawala of Ceylon, Nasser of Egypt, Kojo Botsio of the Gold Coast, Jalal Abdoh of Iran, and Fadhil Jamali of Iraq.
    Everyone expressed his wishes for the conference, which, of course, were not entirely the same as each other, but, generally speaking, the vast majority of speakers pointed out that the conference should help promote world peace and help eliminate colonialism.
    A notable exception was the last speaker, Jamali. In his speech, he devoted a long passage to slandering communism. Jamali groundlessly described communism as a "new type of colonialism." When the vast majority of other speakers pointed out that colonialism had not died and that the people of Asia and Africa should continue to fight to eradicate colonialism, Jamali openly declared that colonialism was already declining and that what should be opposed was communism. When the vast majority of other speakers emphasized that the conference should make the most important contribution to seeking peaceful coexistence among countries, Jamali openly demanded the adoption of what he called "defensive measures" until he envisioned a day when communism would be "ideologically disarmed."
    There had been many reports that "Voice of America" would appear at the Asian-African Conference. Now it seems that the unfortunate prediction has come true.
    Most interestingly, in the press room, someone was holding the "New York Times" editorial that the United States Information Service had just broadcast and comparing it with Jamali's speech. This American newspaper demanded that the Asian-African Conference focus its attention not on opposing "colonialism" and "racism," but on opposing "communism." The newspaper felt "anxious" that the conference would be busy hitting what it called the "dead horse" of colonialism, rather than what it called the "live tiger" of communism.
    Hearing the same voice at the Asian-African Conference cannot but make people feel that a shadow has fallen over the conference that only began this morning.
    The delegates walked out of the Independence Building in the vast twilight, and the applause and cheers on Asia-Africa Street grew louder and louder. The people demanded the success of the conference, and the people would not allow the conference to fail because of a few discordant voices.
    At 7:00 p.m., President Sukarno held a reception at the West Java Governor's Residence in Bandung to entertain the delegations, observers, and journalists attending the Asian-African Conference.
    As outside the venue, the walls of the huge garden of the Governor's Residence were surrounded by cheering crowds. Some Western journalists who had covered the Manila Conference and the Bangkok Conference expressed surprise at this situation, wondering why no one in Manila and Bangkok showed interest in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's meetings, while the people of Bandung showed such endless enthusiasm for the Asian-African Conference, even though the promoters of the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization had repeatedly claimed that their "purpose" was to "defend freedom and peace."
    What Western journalists do not understand is that the people do understand: who really wants to maintain peace and who is just preparing for war. The people understand truth and falsehood, and the people understand love and hate. (To be continued)

　　人民的心同亚非会议在一起

      亚非会议开幕了
    四月十八日星期一
    这是一个不平凡的日子。世界上这么多人期待了这么久的亚非会议要在今天开幕了。
    家家户户都挂起了红白两色的印度尼西亚国旗，在华侨住的房子面前还挂起了五星红旗。似乎万隆的人民都到街上来了，到处都是一簇簇的人群。
    亚非大街从清早起就断绝了交通，穿着绿军服，戴着白钢盔的印度尼西亚士兵们在两边布岗，再外面，一层一层的人站得水泄不透。当汽车一辆接着一辆打他们中间穿过奔向独立大厦的时候，似乎可以感到每一个人都屏住了呼吸，就像人们在等候最重大的事件时所经常感到的那样。
    会议预定在九点钟开始，但是八点钟左右，会议厅的来宾席和记者席上已经坐满了人。
    会场里的人们和会场外的人们一样以迫切的心情等候各国代表团的到来。
    差不多到近九点钟的时候，门外传来了一阵一阵的鼓掌和欢呼，各国代表团陆续进入会议厅了。
    各种各样的服色在你眼前展现。
    戴着绣花小帽，用整幅彩色绸缎裹在身上的是利比里亚人或者黄金海岸人。戴着纱帽，穿着马褂的是缅甸人。用金箍罩住白纱头巾，穿着黑纱长袍的是沙特阿拉伯人。穿着薄纱绣花衬衣，结着小领结的是菲律宾人。裹着厚厚的紫色毛布长袍，插着腰刀的是也门人。一样是穆斯林，土耳其人的帽子是红的，印度尼西亚人的帽子是黑的，埃及人的帽子是白边红心的。一样是带着高领的制服，扣子少而比较短的是中国人，扣子多而长到膝盖的是印度人。……
    在人们的记忆里，可曾有一个集中过这么许多不同民族，种族，肤色，语言，文化……的国家的代表，而同时又连一个殖民国家的代表也没有的国际会议呢？
    没有，这是历史上第一个这样的会议，愿人人祝福它成功。
    大约九点十五分钟左右，门外奏起了印度尼西亚国歌，印度尼西亚总统苏加诺和副总统哈达和他们的夫人在缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦五个发起国家总理的引导下进入会场。
    苏加诺总统是应邀向会议致开幕辞来的。他在长达五十分钟的演说中唤起了全场许多共同的感情。
    他说：“在我环顾这个大厅和在此聚会的贵宾的时候，我内心十分感动。这是人类有史以来第一次的有色人种的洲际会议。”
    他说：“在过去几年中发生了巨大的变化。许多民族和国家从许多世纪的沉睡状态中苏醒过来了。……不可抗拒的力量横扫了两个大陆。”
    他说：“我们大家是由比表面上使我们分裂的东西更为重要的东西联合起来的。例如，我们是由对不论以什么形式出现的殖民主义的共同厌恶联合起来的。我们是由对种族主义的共同厌恶联合起来的。我们是由维护和稳定世界和平的共同决心而联合起来的。”
    他说：“我希望，会议将证明这样的事实：我们，亚洲和非洲的领袖们都了解到，亚洲和非洲只有在团结起来以后才能得到繁荣，……我希望，它将证明，亚洲和非洲已经再生了，新亚洲和新非洲已经诞生了。我们的任务首先是彼此取得谅解，从谅解中将产生彼此间的更大的尊重，从尊重中将产生集体的行动。兄弟姊妹们，让我们记住，为了这一切，我们亚洲人和非洲人必须团结起来。”
    苏加诺总统在全场热烈的掌声中结束了他的演说。五国总理把他和哈达副总统送出了会场。会议接着暂时休会。
    会议在十一点四十五分复会以后，首先一致选举了阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约为亚非会议主席。他接着在掌声中开始了他的演说。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约引述茂物会议的公报说明亚非会议的目的是：（甲）促进亚非各国间的亲善和合作；（乙）讨论社会、经济与文化问题和关系；
  （丙）讨论有关民族主权的问题、种族主义和殖民主义的问题；（丁）讨论亚洲和非洲以及它们的人民今天在世界上的地位，以及他们对于促进世界和平和合作所能作出的贡献。他说：“让这些目的成为我们讨论中的指南吧。”他特别强调会议的责任是对促进世界和平和合作作出坚实的贡献。他最后说：“如果我们能够用毫不含糊的言词表明我们争取和平的愿望和决心……，那末，这次会议就完成了它的历史性的任务。”
    亚非会议的开幕式就这样在沙斯特罗阿米佐约演说以后结束了。以后，代表团团长又举行了秘密会议。一直到一点三十分，各国代表团才离开独立大厦。
    曾经被西方报纸推测是开不起来的亚非会议终于胜利开幕了。二十九个国家的代表已经在一起坐下来，开始讨论共同的问题了。
    当代表们一个接一个走下独立大厦的大理石台阶的时候，亚非大街上站了整整一上午的人们发狂似地跳起来，叫起来。
    他们从装在大街上的扩音器中知道了会议上的一切。他们的心是同会场里紧紧地连系在一起的。人民是亚非会议不在场的参加者。
    和谐一致是上午会议上压倒一切的东西，但是，大家知道前途并不是没有曲折的。考验将在下午会议上来临，各国代表团将在下午会议上开始发言。只有从这些发言中才可以知道刚才宣布的会议的共同目的会被接受到什么程度。
    在今天下午会议上发言的有：柬埔寨的诺罗东姆·西哈努克，锡兰的约翰·科特拉瓦拉，埃及的纳赛尔，黄金海岸的科佐·博齐约，伊朗的贾拉尔·阿布杜和伊拉克的法迪尔·贾马利。
    每一个人都表示了他对会议的愿望，当然，并不彼此完全相同，但是，总的说来，绝大部分的发言者都指出会议应当有助于促进世界和平，有助于消除殖民主义。
    特出的例外是最后一个发言的贾马利。他在发言中以很长的篇幅来诬蔑共产主义。贾马利毫无根据地把共产主义说成是一种“新式的殖民主义”。当其他绝大部分发言者，指出殖民主义还没有死亡，亚非人民还应该为铲除殖民主义而奋斗的时候，贾马利却公然宣称殖民主义已经日益衰亡而应该反对的倒是共产主义。当其他绝大部分发言者强调会议应该对寻求各国间的和平共处作出最重要的贡献的时候，贾马利却公然要求采取他所谓的“防御措施”，一直到他设想有一天共产主义会“在思想上解除武装”为止。
    原来就有许多消息说，在亚非会议上将要出现“美国之音”。现在似乎不幸而言中了。
    最有趣的是，在记者室里，有人拿着美国新闻处刚广播的“纽约时报”今天的社论来和贾马利的发言对比。这家美国报纸要求亚非会议把它的注意力不是放在反对“殖民主义”和“种族主义”上，而是放在反对“共产主义”上。这家报纸感到“忧虑”，它害怕会议会忙于去打它所谓的殖民主义的“死马”，而不是它所谓的共产主义的“活老虎”。
    同样的声音在亚非会议上听见，不能不令人感到已经有一层阴影笼罩上了从今天早晨才开始的会议。
    代表们在苍茫的暮色中走出独立大厦，亚非大街上的掌声和欢呼声一阵高似一阵。人民要求会议成功，人民是不会容许会议因为少数不和谐的声音而得不到结果的。
    晚上七点钟，苏加诺总统在万隆的西爪哇省长官邸举行酒会，招待参加亚非会议的各国代表团，观察员和新闻记者。
    和在会场外面一样，偌大的省长官邸花园的围墙外面团团围住了欢腾着的人群。有一些曾经采访过马尼拉会议和曼谷会议的西方记者对这种情况表示奇怪，奇怪为什么在马尼拉和曼谷没有人对东南亚条约组织的会议表示兴趣，而万隆人民对于亚非会议却表现出这样无穷无尽的热情，虽然所谓东南亚条约组织的策动者也曾反复宣称他们的“目的”是为了“保卫自由和和平”。
    西方记者所不懂得的，人民是懂得的：谁是真正要维护和平，谁不过是在准备战争。人民懂得真假，人民懂得爱憎。　（待续）
