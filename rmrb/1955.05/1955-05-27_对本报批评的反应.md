Reactions to the Newspaper's Criticism

　　After this newspaper criticized the phenomenon of some units wasting talent, various units sent letters stating that the newspaper's criticism was correct. The units have also conducted inspections and made adjustments. The Ministry of Fuel Industry convened a meeting on April 2nd with comrades in charge of allocation from the Coal Mine Management Bureau, the Electricity Management Bureau, and the Petroleum Management Bureau to conduct inspections. The Ministry of Construction Engineering instructed personnel engaged in cadre allocation to strengthen their professional studies and to conscientiously do a good job in the allocation of this year's college graduates. The Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry re-examined last year's allocation plan. Recently, personnel were dispatched to the Northeast to conduct another inspection, and it was stated that unreasonable usage would be resolutely corrected. In addition to organizing forces to focus on checking the use of existing college graduates, the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry revised this year's demand plan for college graduates based on the actual situation. The Broadcasting Affairs Bureau is conducting a comprehensive inspection.
　　The article "Preferential Treatment Funds Should Not Be Held Up or Misappropriated," published by this newspaper on April 26th, criticized the phenomenon of Tangshan Special District, Hebei Province, holding up preferential treatment funds. Now, the Civil Affairs Section of the Tangshan Special Commissioner's Office wrote to say that due to insufficient in-depth work in the past, insufficient attention was paid to the use of preferential treatment funds, resulting in a sum of money being squeezed until the end of the year before being distributed. This year, this lesson has been learned, and instructions have been issued early, requiring all counties to distribute more than half of the annual in-kind subsidies for revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families in the first quarter, combined with spring plowing and production. Now the counties have basically completed the distribution. For example, by April 13th, Changli County had distributed 19,330 yuan, accounting for 48.8 percent of the annual subsidy budget, subsidizing a total of 714 households of revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families, accounting for 10 percent of the total number of revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families. The distribution of this subsidy has played a significant role in supporting spring plowing and production.
　　In the editorial "Glorious Work of Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Soldiers" published by this newspaper on January 24th and the article "Correctly Using the Funds for Preferential Treatment" published on January 14th, criticisms were made against the inappropriate use of preferential treatment funds in Lin County, Henan Province. The Civil Affairs Section of the Lin County People's Committee believes that this criticism is completely correct and very helpful for improving future work. They organized cadres to study, combined with work to conduct inspections, and especially checked the main problems in the use of preferential treatment funds and the reasons for the backlog. The Civil Affairs Section of the Lin County People's Committee said in the letter that the inspection team of the Ministry of Internal Affairs went to Lin County for inspection last winter and put forward many suggestions for improving the work, especially pointing out the direction on the issue of the use of preferential treatment funds, so that the problems such as the backlog of preferential treatment funds were resolved. At the end of last year, the preferential treatment funds were used more reasonably, helping poor revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families solve problems in life and production, such as buying livestock, digging wells, buying farm tools, buying sheep, and buying pigs, thus promoting more than 1,200 poor revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families to participate in agricultural production cooperatives. This year, we have formulated a plan for the use of preferential treatment funds, and in the first quarter, we have used 59 percent of the annual target.

专栏：对本报批评的反应

　　对本报批评的反应
    本报在批评了某些单位浪费人材的现象以后，各单位都来信表示：本报对他们的批评是正确的。各单位并已作了检查和处理。燃料工业部在四月二日即召集了煤矿管理总局、电业管理总局、石油管理总局的负责调配工作的同志进行了检查。建筑工程部并责成做干部调配工作的人员加强业务学习，要求切实做好今年高等学校毕业生的分配工作。重工业部有色金属工业管理局重新审核了去年的分配计划。最近并派人到东北去再进行一次检查，对使用不合理的情况表示要坚决进行纠正。重工业部建筑局除了已组织力量重点检查现有高等学校毕业生的使用情况外，并根据实际情况修订了今年关于高等学校毕业生的需要计划。广播事业局正在作全面检查。
    四月二十六日本报发表的“优抚事业费不应积压和挪用”一文，批评了河北省唐山专区积压优抚事业费的现象。现在唐山专署民政科来信说：由于过去工作不深入，对优抚事业费的使用重视不够，以致去年有一笔款子挤到年底才进行发放。今年已记取了这个教训，并已及早发出指示，要求各县在第
  一季度结合春耕生产发放全年烈、军属实物补助费的半数以上。现在各县已基本发完。如昌黎县到四月十三日止，已发放了一万九千三百三十元，占全年补助费预算的百分之四十八点八，共补助七百十四户烈、军属，占烈、军属总户数的百分之十。这笔补助费发放后，对支持春耕生产起了不小作用。
    本报在一月二十四日发表的“光荣的拥军优属工作”社论和一月十四日发表的“正确运用优抚事业的经费”一文中，对河南省林县使用优抚事业费不当提出了批评。林县人民委员会民政科来信认为，这一批评完全正确，对今后工作的改进很有帮助。他们组织干部进行了学习，结合工作进行了检查，特别检查了对优抚事业费使用中的主要问题和积压的原因。林县人民委员会民政科在来信中说，去冬内务部检查组到林县检查工作，提出了不少改进工作的意见，特别是在优抚事业费的使用问题上指出了方向，使优抚事业费的积压等问题得到解决。去年年终把优抚事业费进行了较合理的使用，帮助贫苦烈、军属解决了生活生产上的问题，如买牲畜、打井、购买农具、买羊、买猪等，因此促进了一千二百多户贫苦烈、军属参加了农业生产合作社。今年我们制定了优抚事业费的使用方案，第一季度已经使用了全年指标的百分之五十九。
