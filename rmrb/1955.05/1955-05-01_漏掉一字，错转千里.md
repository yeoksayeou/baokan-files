　　A Missed Character Leads to a Wild Goose Chase
To the Editor:
　　On April 5th, we received a letter from the Propaganda Department of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. This was the first time the Hunan Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department had written to us, so I couldn't wait to open it and read it. Unexpectedly, the salutation, "Propaganda Department of the CPC Huarong County Committee," shocked me. How could they add a "容" [rong - meaning "容"] character to our county name? Continuing to read, the letter said: "We have received your report, and in response to the issues raised in the report, we now provide the following answers:" Strange, our Hua County Party Committee Propaganda Department has never sent any reports or requests for instructions to the Hunan Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department. Why does the letter say that we have requested instructions from them? Just as I was pondering this, a comrade reminded me: "It seems that there is a Huarong County in Hunan." Yes, the "容" [rong] character in "CPC Huarong County Committee" must have been dropped on the envelope, resulting in "CPC Hua County Committee." The post office couldn't find Hua County in Hunan, so they had to add "Shaanxi" and send it here.
    Because of the missing "容" [rong] character, this "instruction" letter traveled from Changsha, Hunan, to Hua County, Shaanxi. The Huarong County Party Committee Propaganda Department in Hunan must be anxiously awaiting instructions from above, so we will "return the original." But whether this back-and-forth trip, from Hunan to Shaanxi and then back to Hunan, will cause any loss to the work of Huarong County remains unknown!

　  漏掉一字，错转千里编辑同志：
    四月五日，我们接到了一封来自中国共产党湖南省委员会宣传部的信。湖南省委宣传部给我们写信还是第一次，因此我迫不及待地把信件抽出来阅读。不料第一句“中共华容县委宣传部”的称呼就使我大吃一惊。怎么可以把我们县名上加个“容”字呢？接着看下去，信上说：“你们的报告我们收到了，根据报告中所提出的问题，现分别答复于后：”真奇怪，我们华县县委宣传部从来没有向湖南省委宣传部送过什么报告和请示，信上为什么说我们向他们请示过什么问题呢？正在捉摸不定的时候，一个同志提醒了我：“好像湖南有个华容县”。是的，一定是在信封上把“中共华容县委会”的“容”字写丢了，结果成了“中共华县县委会”，邮局在湖南找不到华县，就只好加上“陕西”两个字送来了。
    因为丢了一个“容”字，就使得这封“指示”信由湖南长沙跑到了陕西华县。湖南华容县委宣传部一定迫切地等着上级的指示，我们就把“原件寄回”。但是从湖南到陕西，再从陕西回到湖南，这样一来一往，会不会给华容县的工作造成损失，那就不得而知了！
