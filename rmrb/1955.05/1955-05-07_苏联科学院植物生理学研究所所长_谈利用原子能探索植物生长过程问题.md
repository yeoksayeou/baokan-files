Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 5th: According to TASS, Moscow, May 4th, the director of the Institute of Plant Physiology of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Kursanov, made a statement to TASS reporters on the question of using atomic energy to deeply explore the processes of plant growth and rapidly solve specific agricultural tasks. He said: We use tracer atoms to directly and accurately observe how plants absorb nutrients from the soil, the movement of nutrient solutions in plant tissues, and the metabolic reactions of substances that penetrate plant cells. This has greatly changed our understanding of plant growth and the relationship between plants and their surrounding environment. Our research using tracer atoms shows that plant physiological processes proceed at great speed. For example, in beets, pumpkins, and some other plants, the rate of nutrient movement from the leaves to the roots reaches seventy to one hundred centimeters per hour. Undoubtedly, agricultural workers should take this into account in order to make the methods of caring for plants precise.

Based on experiments using radioactive phosphorus, calcium, sulfur, heavy nitrogen, and organic matter, as well as tracer radioactive carbon, our understanding of plant absorption of nutrients through the roots has been greatly enriched. According to experiments with oats, if tracer granular phosphate fertilizer is placed in the soil at a depth of three to four centimeters, then the small roots can "meet" the fertilizer within two to three days after seed germination. If the fertilizer is moved to a place five to six centimeters deep from the seed, then this meeting will be delayed to three to four weeks.

Kursanov pointed out: Until now, everyone believed that the sugar in beets was formed in the roots. After using tracer atoms, researchers obtained the completely opposite conclusion: sugar is initially formed in the leaves of beets, and then moves to the roots. The research on the synthesis process of economically valuable substances in crops is of great significance for their selection and cultivation.

Kursanov concluded by saying that we are happy to introduce our experience to scientists in other countries. True science can only develop towards the goals of progress and human happiness. Therefore, as upright people from all countries are widely united under the banner of peace today, we Soviet scientists call on all scientific workers to strive to ensure that the great achievements of human wisdom—atomic energy—are used only for peaceful purposes.

　　苏联科学院植物生理学研究所所长
　　谈利用原子能探索植物生长过程问题
    新华社五日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：苏联科学院植物生理学研究所所长库尔萨诺夫就利用原子能深入地探索植物生长的过程和迅速地解决农业上的具体任务的问题向塔斯社记者发表谈话说：我们利用示踪原子，可以直接而精确地观察植物如何从土壤中吸收营养物质，养液在植物组织中的运动和渗入植物细胞中去的物质的新陈代谢的反应，因而使我们大大改变了对植物的生长以及植物同它周围环境的关系的认识。我们研究所利用示踪原子进行的研究工作表明，植物的生理过程是以很大的速度进行的。譬如说，在甜菜、南瓜和其他一些植物中，营养物质从叶部到根部的运动速度达到每小时七十至一百公分。毫无疑问，农业工作者要使照顾植物的方法精确，是应该估计到这一点的。
    根据利用放射性的磷、钙、硫、重氮和有机物质以及示踪放射性碳的试验结果，大大丰富了我们对植物通过根部来吸收营养物质的认识。根据用燕麦试验的结果证明：如果把示踪颗状磷酸肥料放在三、四公分深的土壤中，那末在种子发芽后的两、三天内，小根就可以和肥料“相会”了。如果把那肥料移到离种子五、六公分深的地方，那末这种相会就要推迟到三、四周。
    库尔萨诺夫指出：一直到现在大家都认为甜菜中的糖分是在根部形成的。研究人员在利用了示踪原子之后，得到了完全相反的结论：糖分是最初在甜菜的叶部形成，然后再向根部运动。对农作物中有经济价值的物质的合成过程的研究工作，对它们的选种和培植都有很大的意义。
    库尔萨诺夫最后说，我们乐于把我们的经验介绍给其他国家的科学家。真正的科学只有向着进步和人类幸福的目标才能得到发展。因此，当各国正直的人们广泛地团结在和平的旗帜下的今天，我们苏联科学家号召全体科学工作者为争取使人类智慧的伟大成果——原子能只用于和平目的而奋斗。
