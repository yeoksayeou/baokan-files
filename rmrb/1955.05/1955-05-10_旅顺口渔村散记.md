Random Notes from Lüshunkou Fishing Village
By our reporter Lin Gang

　　Along the coast of the Lüshunkou area are continuous rolling mountains. The mountains are ochre-yellow and not very high, and the road meanders effortlessly along their sides. The calm, azure sea is enticingly beautiful. Scattered fishing villages are nestled at the foot of the mountains and along the coast. The houses, courtyard walls, and pigsties are all made of stone, a scene very similar to the fishing villages of the Shandong Peninsula across the Bohai Sea. Sampans newly painted with oil cover the beaches and courtyards, and fishermen weave and mend their nets in the sun.

　　I walked from one village to another. Compared to the old liberated area of Jiaodong, liberation came much later here, but the lives of the fishermen here are also relatively prosperous, and the people are highly conscious. The fishermen attribute all the happiness, joy, and progress of today to the liberation by the Soviet army and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　Our compatriots living on this land spent forty years of slave life in the past half-century. Who can count how many fishermen died tragically in "labor camps"? More than half of the fish caught by the fishermen had to be handed over to the Japanese "fisheries association." The cruel exploitation of ship owners and fish merchants squeezed the lifeblood out of the fishermen. In the early spring of 1945, when the weather was cold and the water was freezing, the fisherman Song Chengjian took his twelve-year-old child out to sea. At dusk, there was not a single boat at sea—it was not the fishing season. If it hadn't been for the children who had been hungry for days crying so miserably, which tore at his heart; if there had been even a mouthful of food at home, Song Chengjian would not have come to the sea. In the middle of the night, a strong northerly wind rose. His wife rushed out of the house and stood blankly on the shore, waiting. The father and son never returned. A few days later, villagers found the bodies on a desolate beach. The boat was floating on the water, not overturned. Song Chengjian was sitting curled up, holding the oar in his hand, his head drooping on his chest; his son lay stiff in the cabin. With no food in their stomachs and wearing only thin clothes, they had lost the strength to fight the wind and waves and had frozen to death at sea. Song Chengjian, a sixth-generation fisherman, had fished all his life but never saved a penny, and died of hunger in the end, dying in the wind and waves. This is the true historical picture of the lives of fishermen in Lüshunkou under Japanese rule.

　　Today, all the fish caught by the fishermen belong to them. The Soviet army liberated Lüshunkou, removing all the shackles and exploitation imposed on the fishermen. They organized agricultural and fishery production cooperatives (most of the fishing villages here are a combination of agriculture and fishing). They no longer use the broken fishing nets left by their fathers; they build new sampans and purchase new sails, motorboats, and various new fishing nets that they had never had before. There are bumper harvests at sea, and the granaries are full at home. Going to sea with a bowl of thin porridge has long become a distant memory; now fishermen take fine grains and apples to sea. In winter, which fisherman doesn't have a big cotton-padded coat? In spring and autumn, neatly dressed in green and blue, fishermen only wrap themselves in ragged clothes when they go to sea—these are "work clothes." The fishermen in the Lüshunkou area understand the meaning of the word "liberation" the most. Liberation means first and foremost "being able to survive!" Being human, no longer a slave! Liberation means building a happy new life with one's own labor under the leadership of the Communist Party!

　　Living together for ten years, the fishermen and the Soviet army have formed a close friendship. Many friendship stories circulate in the fishing villages, and each story is permeated with the great spirit of internationalism.

　　Encountering a big storm at sea is the greatest disaster for those who make their living from the sea. Fishermen call it "zhao bao" (招暴 - inviting violence). The sea howls, swallowing several victims every year. In the village where Song Chengjian, mentioned earlier, lived, I also visited another old fisherman, Song Chenghong. In the tenth month of the lunar calendar in the second year after liberation, he and his eldest son went out to sea to catch yellow croaker and encountered a storm. The father and son struggled against the raging wind and waves. Something terrible happened: the oar broke. The old man had also exhausted his strength. He looked at the sky, which was so dark, with wind and snow growing stronger. He looked at the sea, which was churning with waves, opening its greedy mouth. The old man thought, "There is no escape," and slumped into the cabin. His son dropped anchor and looked around the bow of the boat with a sense of despair. Suddenly, a beam of light swept across their small boat. After a while, a warship slowly approached, lowered a rope, and rescued the father and son onto the warship. The people on the ship gave them dry clothes to change into, led them to the boiler room to warm themselves, and gave them soup and bread. The old man asked his son, "Are we dreaming?" The son said, "This is the ship of the Soviet elder brother." After telling the story, Song Chenghong said to me, "The Soviet elder brother saved the lives of our father and son twice (I understand that the first time refers to liberation), and we will never forget this kindness!" Looking at his face covered with the wrinkles of fishing nets, and at his moist eyes, I thought of the fate of another pair of fisherman father and son. I thought about what is enslavement and what is friendship.

　　In recent years, with weather forecasts, there have been no more incidents of "zhao bao." But the story of Soviet warships rescuing fishermen in storms (there are dozens, hundreds of such stories) will be passed down among fishermen for generations.

　　During the period of Japanese rule, when fishermen encountered warships, it was like encountering a disaster star. They often caused trouble for no reason, receiving a beating and having a cabin full of fish taken away; otherwise, their fishing line would be broken, or their fishing boat would be overturned. Now, when the fishing season arrives, go to the sea and see, day and night, thousands of fishing boats shuttle between warships, freely catching fish. The Soviet soldiers also like to joke with the fishermen with gestures, as close as family. The fishermen said, "In the past, the sea was a bitter sea. Now, when the sea makes a wave, we feel happy in our hearts."

　　Soviet soldiers patrol the coast day and night. They protect peace in the Far East and also protect the peaceful lives of the fishermen. The village militia and self-defense forces are also organized, standing guard, and assisting the Soviet army in defending the naval base. During the most tense years of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, women participated in the self-defense forces, checking flags and boat tickets at sea. The fishermen work hard at sea for a day and then sleep peacefully when they return. Fishing boats are docked on the shore, and fishing nets and fishing lines are left on the boats. They no longer have to worry about bad elements burning fishing boats, cutting fishing nets, and stealing fishing gear. One night, the fisherman Ding Xinzuo was sound asleep when someone knocked on the door. He got up and opened the door, and two Soviet soldiers came in, each holding a fish. They had come off guard and were going back to rest, and they discovered a school of fish in the sea, so they came to tell their friend Old Ding. Ding Xinzuo immediately came to the sea, and the two Soviet soldiers helped him pull the net. That night, they pulled four nets and got about four hundred catties of fish.

　　Soviet military doctors and health workers have become our "country doctors." If fishermen have illnesses, as long as they go to the Soviet army, they will always get help. This happened four years ago: The fisherman Kong Xiancai encountered a storm at sea and his boat capsized. When the villagers rescued him, Kong Xiancai's whole body was stiff, his eyes were staring straight ahead, and he was on the verge of death. If he were sent to Lüshun Hospital, he would die halfway. His whole family of eight depended on him for a living, and his wife and children were crying. The Soviet army lieutenant military doctor stationed in the village rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and performed artificial respiration, gave him a cardiac stimulant, and administered medicine. From 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. the next morning, the lieutenant guarded the patient until the patient woke up and began to speak his first words. Kong Xiancai's wife said to me, "The Soviet elder brother saved the lives of our family of eight."

　　Almost every fishing village has a cultural station. The prettier ones were built with the help of the Soviet army. I once visited a cultural station designed and built with building materials supplied by the Soviet army. The external architectural style is quite like a "theater," simple but not crude. There are platforms, stone steps, rain eaves, and two brick columns at the entrance. The interior can accommodate four or five hundred people and has a stage. There are many windows on both walls, and the light is very bright. Fishermen hold meetings here, listen to reports, hold parties, and watch movies. During the day, women's literacy classes are held, and at night, high school graduates take remedial classes, all of which are also held here.

　　On ordinary days, the Soviet army does not enter the village to visit unless they go to the cooperative to buy things, or borrow water scoops, chaff cutters, etc.; the fishermen do not go to the barracks to play either. On Sundays or holidays, the village's cultural station and the Soviet army's soldiers' club become places for cultural exchange. Soviet soldiers teach young people to dance Russian folk dances, and they themselves also learn to do the Yangko dance and sing "The East is Red." The militia and elementary school teachers often hold basketball games with the Soviet army. Children gather around the playful Soviet soldiers to have fun.

　　When I arrived at a village on the east coast, it was already past dusk. I stayed overnight at the village chief's house. As soon as I entered the door, I felt something was different. After a moment, I realized that the stove, water tank, heated kang, boxes, cabinets, and corn bins were all still in their original positions, but there were a few more electric lights in the house. Seeing electric lights in a remote mountain village was a first for me, so naturally, I was surprised. The village chief's son knew that I was from Beijing and immediately turned on the radio and asked me to listen to programs from the Central People's Broadcasting Station. Only then did I realize that there was also a radio on the high red-lacquered table. The electric lights were also installed with the help of the Soviet army. With electric lights, fishermen no longer have to go to the beach for tasks such as threading lines and hanging weizi (a type of fish trap) at night, and it is much easier to hold meetings and study. I asked the village chief how many villages had electric lights. The village chief said, "I only know that there are seven or eight villages with electric lights in our district. Thanks to the Soviet elder brother, we are living a socialist life ahead of time."

　　This sincere and moving friendship between the Soviet army and the fishermen warmed the hearts of the fishermen and educated them. In the days when the Soviet army was about to return home, everyone could feel that the corners of the fishing village were filled with an atmosphere of reluctance to part. During these days, when district cadres went to the countryside, the fishermen always asked, "Can't the Soviet elder brother not leave?" So, the district cadres explained to them the great significance of the Soviet army's withdrawal from the Lüshunkou area for safeguarding world peace. But when another cadre went to the countryside, they would still ask this question. From the west coast to the east coast, farewell parties were held everywhere. At the meeting, Soviet soldiers said goodbye calling "Mama" and "Papa," and I saw the same feeling of reluctance to part in the eyes of these Soviet youths. Women tearfully presented their most beloved things as gifts to their liberators and relatives. An old woman hung a sachet on the chest of a Soviet soldier, and she asked the translator to tell him: "This sachet is woven from a single thread to the end. Sending this means that our friendship with the Soviet elder brother is also connected to the end and will never be broken." Such meetings are not easy to disperse, and the fishermen cannot express their gratitude in their hearts enough.

### 旅顺口渔村散记

　　旅顺口渔村散记
　　本报记者　林钢
    沿着旅顺口地区的海岸，是连绵起伏的群山。山是赭黄色的，不很高，公路不费力气的蜿蜒在它的腹背。平静的碧蓝色的海，美丽得诱人。疏疏落落的渔村，座落在山麓和海岸上。房屋、院墙、猪栏都是石砌的，那景物，同隔渤海相望的山东半岛的渔村十分相似。海滩上、场院里覆盖着新油好的舢板，渔民们在太阳下织补鱼网。
    我从一个村庄走到另一个村庄。比起老解放区的胶东，这里解放得晚的多，但这里渔民的生活也是比较富裕的，老百姓的觉悟程度很高。渔民们把今天的一切幸福、欢乐和进步，都归之于苏军的解放，归之于中国共产党的领导。
    生活在这块土地上的我们的同胞，在最近半个世纪里，四十年过的是奴隶生活。谁能数得清，有多少渔民惨死在“劳工营”里？渔民们打来的鱼，半数以上要交给日本人的“渔业组合”。船主和渔客的残酷剥削，榨尽了渔民的膏血。一九四五年初春，天寒水冷，渔民宋成俭带了十二岁的孩子出海去。黄昏，海上没有一条船——这不是捕鱼的季节。要不是饿了几天的孩子们哭的那样惨，绞痛了他的心；要是他家里还有一口粮，宋成俭也不会到海上来的。半夜里，刮起了大北风。他的妻子狂奔出屋子，呆呆地站在岸边盼望。父子俩从此就没有回来。过了几天，村里人在一个荒滩发现了死者。船漂在水上，没有翻。宋成俭卷曲身子坐着，手里握着橹，头栽在胸前；儿子僵卧在舱里。肚里没有食，身上穿的单薄，他们是失却了和风浪搏斗的力气，冻毙在海上的。宋成俭，六世的渔民，自己也打了一辈子鱼，没攒下一个钱，临终死于饥饿，死在风浪里。这就是在日寇统治下旅顺口渔民生活的真实历史。
    今天，渔民打来的鱼全部是自己的了。苏军解放旅顺口，解除了加在渔民身上的一切枷锁和剥削。他们组织了农渔业生产合作社（这里的渔村，多半是农渔结合的）。他们不再用父亲留下来的破鱼网，他们添造新的舢板，购置从来没有过的风帆、汽船和各种新的鱼网。海上大丰收，屋里粮满囤。喝一碗稀粥出海的事，早已成为久远的回忆；如今渔民们都带着细粮和苹果到海上去。冬天，那一个渔民没有个大棉袄？春秋两季，青的蓝的，整整齐齐，渔民只在出海的时候还裹着破衣裳，这是
  “工作服”。旅顺口地区的渔民是最懂得“解放”两字的意义的。解放，这首先是“能活下去了！”是人，不再是奴隶了！解放，这就是在共产党的领导下，用自己的劳动建设幸福的新生活！
    十年相处，渔民和苏军结成了亲密的友谊。渔村流传着许多友谊故事，每个故事都浸透着伟大的国际主义精神。
    出海遇着大风浪，是闯海的人们最大的灾难。渔民称为“招暴”。海呼啸着，每年都要吞噬几个牺牲者。在前面写过的宋成俭居住的村子里，我还访问了另一位老渔民宋成鸿。解放后第二年阴历十月间，他和大儿子出海吊黄花鱼，招了风暴。父子俩和狂风巨浪搏斗着。可怕的事情发生了：橹断了。老人也已用尽了力气。他望望天，夜那末黑，连风加雪，越刮越紧。他望望海，海翻腾着浪，张着贪婪的大口。老人心里想：“在劫难逃”，颓然倒在舱里。儿子下了锚，怀着绝望的心情，在船头张望。突然，一道灯光掠过他们的小船。过了一回，一艘军舰缓缓靠近来，放下了一根绳子，把父子俩救上了军舰。舰上的人给他们干衣服换，领他们到锅炉房烤火，还给他们汤和面包。老人问儿子：“我们不是在做梦？”儿子说：“这是苏联老大哥的船。”讲完故事，宋成鸿对我说：“苏联老大哥两次（我懂得，第一次指的是解放）救了咱爷儿俩的命，这恩情咱永世也忘不了！”我望着他那布满渔网皱的脸，望着他的湿润的眼睛，想起了另一对渔民父子的命运。我想着，什么是奴役，什么是友谊。
    这几年，有了气象预报，再也没有“招暴”的事了。但苏军军舰在狂风巨浪中拯救渔民的故事
  （这样的故事有数十个，数百个），将世世代代在渔民中间流传着。
    日寇统治时期，渔民们遇见了军舰，犹如遇着灾星。经常无端惹祸，遭一顿打，被夺去一舱鱼；要不然，或被撞断渔线，或被撞翻渔船。如今，到了捕鱼的季节，你到海上去看看，白天黑夜，千条万条渔船穿梭在军舰之间，自由地捕着鱼。苏军战士们还爱和捕鱼的人们比划着手势开个玩笑，亲如家人。渔民们说：“过去的海是苦海，现在海翻个浪花，看着心里也高兴。”
    在海岸上，日夜有苏军战士在巡逻。他们保卫着远东和平，也保卫着渔民的和平生活。渔村的民兵和自卫队也组织起来，站岗放哨，协助苏军保卫海军根据地。在抗美援朝战争最紧张的那些年月，妇女都参加了自卫队，在海上查旗查船票。渔民们辛苦地出海一天，回来就安稳地睡觉了。渔船泊在岸边，渔网、渔线都撂在船上。他们再也不用担心坏分子来烧渔船，割渔网，偷去渔具。有一夜，渔民丁新作正在酣睡，有人敲门。他起来开门，进来两位苏军战士，各人手里拿着一尾鱼。他们是下了岗哨，要回去休息的，发现海里来了鱼群，便来告诉他们的朋友老丁。丁新作立即来到海上，两位苏军战士帮他拉网。这一晚上拉了四网，得到四百来斤鱼。
    苏军的军医和卫生员，成了我们的“乡村医生”。渔民们有疾病，只要去找苏军，无不有求必应。这是四年前的事：渔民孔宪财，出海招暴，翻了船。村里人把他救回来时，孔宪财全身僵挺，两眼直瞪，已奄奄一息。如果送到旅顺医院，半路上就要咽气。全家八口指着他一个人养活，老婆孩子哭成一片。驻在本村的苏军中尉军医闻声赶了来，给孔宪财施行人工呼吸法、打强心针、服药。从下午四点到第二天清晨七点，中尉一直守护着病人，直到病人苏醒过来，开始讲第一句话。孔宪财的老婆对我说：“苏联老大哥救活了咱家八条命。”
    几乎每个渔村都有文化站。凡是漂亮一些的，都是苏军帮助盖的。我曾参观过一个由苏军设计并供给建筑材料建成的文化站，外部建筑型式颇似一
  “剧院”，简而不陋。门口有平台、阶石、雨檐，还有二根砖砌圆柱。室内能容四、五百人，有一舞台。两壁窗户很多，光线很亮。渔民们在这里开大会，听报告，举行联欢会，看电影。白天妇女文化班上课，夜间高小毕业生补习功课，也都在这里。
    平常日子，苏军除了到合作社买东西，或借水梢、铡刀之类，是不进村串门的；渔民也不到营房去玩。一到星期天，或遇假日，村里的文化站和苏军的士兵俱乐部就成了文化交流的场所。苏军战士教青年们跳俄罗斯民间舞，他们自己也学扭秧歌，学唱“东方红”。民兵、小学教师常和苏军举行篮球比赛。孩子们围着爱闹玩的苏军士兵逗乐。
    我到东海岸某村时，黄昏已过。夜宿村长家。一进门，感到有些异样。稍一定神，才发觉锅台、水缸、暖炕、箱柜、苞米囤，都仍在原来的位置，只是屋里多了几盏电灯。在偏僻的山村看见电灯，平生尚是第一次，自然要吃惊了。村长的儿子知道我是北京来的，立即打开收音机，请我听中央人民广播电台的节目。我这才发觉红漆的高桌上还有收音机。电灯也是苏军帮助安装的。有了电灯，渔民们捣线、挂味子等夜间作业都不再跑到海滩上去了，开会学习都方便不少。我问村长，能有多少村庄有电灯？村长说：“我光知咱区就有七、八个村子有电灯。托苏联老大哥的福，咱提前过社会主义生活了。”
    苏军和渔民之间这种真诚感人的友谊，温暖了渔民的心，教育了渔民。在苏军行将回国的日子里，谁都能感觉到，渔村的各个角落弥漫着无限惜别的情绪。这些日子，区里干部下乡，渔民们总要问：“苏联老大哥不能不走吗？”于是区干部向他们解释苏军自旅顺口地区撤退对保卫世界和平的伟大意义。但另一个干部下乡时，他们还是要这样问。从西海岸到东海岸，到处都在举行欢送会。会上，苏军战士叫着“妈妈”“爸爸”道别，我在这些苏维埃青年的眼里看到了同样的惜别的感情。妇女们含泪把她们最心爱的东西当作礼物赠献给自己的解放者、亲人。有一位老太太把一个香荷包挂在苏军战士的胸前，她要翻译告诉他：“这荷包，是一根线编到底的。送这个，表示我们和苏联老大哥的友情也一连到底，永远不断。”这样的会是不容易散的，渔民们讲不尽心里的感谢话。
