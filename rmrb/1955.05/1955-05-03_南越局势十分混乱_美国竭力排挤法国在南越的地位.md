Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 2nd: Saigon Dispatch: The situation in South Vietnam is very chaotic. The United States is exerting efforts to stabilize the Ngo Dinh Diem regime.

On the 2nd, the U.S. Special Envoy to South Vietnam, Collins, rushed back to Saigon from Washington. He will soon meet with Ngo Dinh Diem to discuss the latest developments.

Under the manipulation of Ngo Dinh Diem, the so-called "Democratic Revolutionary Forces Congress" held in Saigon on April 30th resolved to "depose" Bao Dai's position as "Head of State." The congress also announced the dissolution of the current government appointed by Bao Dai and demanded that Ngo Dinh Diem organize a new interim government.

News reports say that important members of the U.S. Congress have welcomed the "deposition" of Bao Dai by the Ngo Dinh Diem faction, and the State Department has even repeatedly publicly expressed support for Ngo Dinh Diem. Sources say that the United States, through its embassies in Paris and Saigon, has told France and Bao Dai not to interfere in the situation in South Vietnam. The United States has also asked French leaders in Paris and Saigon to change their attitude and fully support Ngo Dinh Diem.

According to United Press International, France has responded to the U.S. protest. France pointed out that the chaos in South Vietnam is the result of the U.S. policy of supporting Ngo Dinh Diem. Meanwhile, on April 30th, a spokesperson for the French Ministry of Relations with Associated States of Indochina said that France still considers Bao Dai to be the "Head of State of Vietnam."

Bao Dai once again telegraphed Ngo Dinh Diem on the 1st, summoning him to Cannes, France, to "consult" on the situation in South Vietnam. However, news reports say that Ngo Dinh Diem has decided not to go to France. At the same time, Nguyen Van Vy, the Inspector General of the South Vietnamese Army, who was entrusted by Bao Dai to take over military power, returned to Da Lat from Saigon on the 1st after a period of unsuccessful activity.

　　南越局势十分混乱
　　美国竭力排挤法国在南越的地位
    新华社河内二日电　西贡消息：南越的局势十分混乱。美国正竭力稳定吴庭艳政权。
    二日，美国驻南越特使柯林斯从华盛顿赶回西贡。他即将同吴庭艳会谈最近局势的发展。
    在吴庭艳的操纵下，四月三十日在西贡举行的所谓“民主革命力量大会”，决议“废黜”保大的
  “国家元首”的地位。大会还宣布解散由保大任命的现政府，并且要求吴庭艳组织一个新的临时政府。
    消息说，美国国会重要议员对吴庭艳分子“废黜”保大表示欢迎，国务院甚至接连公开表示支持吴庭艳。有消息说，美国通过它驻巴黎和西贡的大使馆告诉法国和保大，要他们不要去干涉南越局势。美国并且要求在巴黎和西贡的法国领袖改变态度，去全力支持吴庭艳。
    据合众社报道，法国已经答复了美国的抗议。法国指出，南越陷入混乱是美国支持吴庭艳的政策导致的。同时，法国的印度支那联邦成员国关系部的发言人四月三十日说，法国认为保大仍旧是“越南的国家元首”。
    保大已在一日再次电召吴庭艳到法国戛纳去
  “磋商”南越局势。但是，有消息说，吴庭艳决定不去法国。同时，被保大委托去接管军权的南越陆军总监阮文维，一度活动失败后，在一日又从西贡回到大叻。
