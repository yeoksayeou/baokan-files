Launch a Comprehensive Conservation Campaign

Our motherland is advancing rapidly along the road of socialist industrialization. By 1954, the total output value of China's modern industry was more than four times that of 1949, and the total output value of industry and agriculture was more than twice that of 1949. When China's first Five-Year Plan is completed, it is estimated that the total industrial output value of the country will increase by about 100 percent compared with 1952, and the total industrial and agricultural output value will increase by about 50 percent. After several five-year plans, we will be able to build a strong, modern socialist industrial country. By that time, our country will be stronger and more prosperous, and the material and cultural living standards of our people will be greatly improved, and our descendants for generations to come will live a happy and joyful life. To realize China's socialist construction is the great and glorious task of the Chinese people.

However, realizing China's socialist industrialization is by no means an easy task. China's socialist industrialization plan is a plan centered on vigorously developing heavy industry. As everyone knows, building heavy industry requires a large amount of long-term investment. However, China's industrial and agricultural production is backward, the small-scale peasant economy dominates the agricultural economy, and capitalist industry and commerce account for a large proportion of industry and commerce, so the accumulation of national funds is slow, which is a difficulty for us to concentrate our efforts on building heavy industry. Overcoming this difficulty is particularly important to ensure the completion of the tasks of the last three years of the First Five-Year Plan. According to the provisions of the draft Five-Year Plan, the state's basic construction investment allocated to the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, and the Ministry of Machinery Industry during the five years accounts for about 80 percent of the total industrial basic construction investment, of which more than two-thirds is concentrated in the last three years. Most of the new and renovated enterprises with huge production capacity during the five years will not be completed and put into production until 1956, 1957, or even the Second Five-Year Plan period. On the one hand, the amount of investment is increasing year by year, and on the other hand, new enterprises cannot quickly realize the investment effect. How should this contradiction be overcome? The only way is to mobilize the strength of the whole country to increase the accumulation of funds on the basis of further developing production and to practice thrift while ensuring key construction. At present, launching a comprehensive conservation campaign is of more realistic and serious significance, because it can most effectively save funds and increase accumulation. For example, state-owned and local state-owned textile industries recently re-studied the five-year investment plan according to the instructions of the central government. Without affecting the progress of the five-year plan, they stopped or delayed the construction of more than 800,000 spindles and several all-round weaving workshops and dyeing factories, and reduced some reserve funds, immediately saving the country more than 700 million yuan. This fund can be used to build a factory with an annual output of 15,000 tractors and a refinery with an annual output of 1 million tons. If all departments that use money can resolutely stop unnecessary, non-urgent, and expendable expenditures, and practice thrift in very necessary expenditures, we will definitely be able to accumulate more construction funds and ensure the smooth progress of key construction.

In order to launch a comprehensive conservation campaign, we must resolutely oppose the current waste phenomenon in all aspects. We should establish a regular conservation system, establish a diligent and simple style, and carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle. All socialist enterprises, whether in basic construction, production, or material and commodity circulation, and all work organs, whether they are party organs, government organs, or military organs, should resolutely implement the principle of conservation, and use their exemplary role to lead the people of the whole country to establish a thrifty style. This is the long-term and regular task of the Chinese people in building a socialist society and even a communist society. Any work organ, any enterprise department, or any staff member who does not take a serious, earnest, and responsible attitude on the issue of conservation and wastes state property at will is committing a crime against the country and the people.

It should be admitted that the current waste phenomenon is quite common, especially in the industrial, transportation, and commercial sectors, and even more serious in the basic construction projects of these sectors. For example, in 1954, the idling expenses of various units of the Ministry of Heavy Industry amounted to about 6.7 million yuan; by the end of November 1954, the First Automobile Factory had accumulated 10 million yuan in materials alone. Of course, some of this type of waste is also due to objective reasons. Basic construction investment is large and expenditure is large. Any slight error will cause huge waste; however, the level of our current planning work, design work, and management work is very low, and it is impossible to completely avoid these errors. However, as long as we pay serious attention to conservation in our ideological understanding and practical work, a lot of waste can be avoided or reduced. For example, some departments and local state organs blindly carry out construction regardless of priorities, which causes avoidable waste. Some departments or construction units do not strictly follow the basic construction procedures, and blindly design and construct before the resources and engineering and hydrogeological conditions have been clarified, resulting in a lot of waste. The Jiaohe Zhonggang Shaft, Beipiao Taiji Shaft, Jixi Xiaohengshan Shaft, Xinqiu No. 2 Mine, and Guangyi Shaft of the Ministry of Fuel Industry were abandoned halfway after drilling hundreds of meters because no coal was found, or were forced to stop work due to quicksand and water inflow during excavation, or geological reports could not be submitted even after tens of thousands of meters of drilling. Is this type of waste completely unavoidable? Can this phenomenon still be allowed to continue?

In addition to the basic construction departments, the waste in the production departments, transportation departments, and commodity circulation departments is also not small. They mainly manifest themselves in relaxing the management of financial costs, slow capital turnover, excessive consumption of raw materials and fuel, poor labor organization, high product costs, low quality, many defective and substandard products, and poor warehouse management. Taking the management expenses of enterprises as an example, there is a very large disparity in the current situation. For example, the state-owned Qingdao No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and the state-owned Shanghai No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory have similar equipment scale, but in 1954, the expenditure of the latter's workshop expenses was more than twice that of the former. Comparing Shixian Paper Mill and Jilin Paper Mill, the management fee allocated per ton of newsprint is 38.3 yuan for the former and 15.64 yuan for the latter. If we work hard to reduce the consumption of raw materials and lower product costs, we can save a lot. For example, in 1954, the highest amount of tobacco leaves used per case of cigarettes was 130 jin, and the lowest was 120.5 jin; in January of this year, the amount of cotton used per piece of cotton yarn in Shanghai's local state-private joint cotton spinning mills was 394 jin at the highest and 386 jin at the lowest. If all cigarette factories and cotton mills across the country can reach or approach the lowest level, a lot of tobacco leaves and cotton can be saved. For another example, in 1954, railway freight trains were short of more than 10 million tons according to the prescribed indicators, and single locomotives traveled more than 3 million kilometers beyond the plan, which wasted 3.37 million yuan; the Ministry of Commerce alone had dead pigs and rotten eggs worth 8 million yuan in 1954. Obviously, these wastes can also be reduced or completely avoided.

In party organs, government organs, military organs, and cultural and educational institutions at all levels, the waste of funds, materials, and manpower is also very serious. Some organs, divorced from the living standards of the masses and the country's economic conditions, arbitrarily build luxurious office buildings, staff dormitories, sanatoriums, and auditoriums. Some organs unlimitedly increase the number of automobiles and various furniture, and place many sofas and carpets in conference rooms, offices, and dormitories. Some organs blindly store office supplies, some of which have enough stationery and paper for several years. In fact, all office expenses of higher-level organs can and must be reduced, and this reduction is of great significance to the national conservation campaign. The grain consumption of various organs must also be reduced. Recent key inspections by agencies in various provinces and cities have proven that the grain rations in various cities, especially in various agencies, are generally too high. After careful calculation, the supply standard can generally save about 6 to 10 percent. Another huge task of agency savings is streamlining the organization. The staffing of management departments of our state organs, institutions, and enterprises is generally too large. For example, among the ministries at the central level, there are five ministries with more than 5,000 people, one with more than 4,000 people, four with more than 3,000 people, and even more ministries with 2,000 and 1,000 people. According to preliminary calculations, generally 20 to 50 percent can be transferred. This shows that the staffing of agencies can be completely reduced. The result of the increase in agency personnel not only seriously wastes the country's financial resources, but also seriously wastes the country's manpower. Some people say: More people can do things better. In fact, this is not the case at all. With the increase in agency personnel, service undertakings and service personnel will inevitably increase, and the administrative work in the agency will become more and more, and the phenomena of bureaucracy and red tape will become more and more serious. The increase in the number of leaders not only reduces the manpower engaged in productive labor, but also weakens the manpower directly engaged in organizational work among the masses, and many people in higher-level agencies are uneasy because they have no or little work to do. How can this get things done?

Conservation is the fundamental method of socialist accumulation. In order to build our motherland, the leading organs of all departments and regions must rationally and economically allocate and use state funds; must make full use of existing production, transportation, and commodity circulation equipment; must minimize construction and production costs and reduce various circulation costs; must immediately start streamlining organizations, determine staffing quotas, and rationally use manpower; and must try to improve work efficiency and labor productivity in all aspects. This is a major task that all organizations across the country must resolutely implement without exception. All ideas and behaviors that violate the principle of conservation must be thoroughly opposed so that they have no place to stand.

In order to implement the principle of conservation, it is necessary to earnestly stipulate and improve various quotas, strictly examine budgets and final accounts, and gradually stipulate and promote strict financial systems and financial supervision systems. All state workers must strictly abide by financial discipline, and wage a struggle against those who lack economic viewpoints, violate financial discipline, and waste state funds, and give various due punishments up to criminal punishments.

In order to oppose waste, practice thrift, and implement financial supervision and strict financial discipline, we must rely on the broad masses of the people. It is impossible to achieve the goal without the masses. Every organization, every production unit, and every work unit in the country should mobilize all the masses to treat public property and state funds with the attitude of masters, conduct a thorough inspection of the unit's income and expenditure plans and the results of their implementation, expose shortcomings and errors in all aspects, put forward various suggestions for improvement, and supervise their implementation. Each unit should formulate various methods for implementing mass supervision on a monthly basis based on specific conditions, so that they become universal and permanent systems. The party and state supervisory organs, the party and state newspapers and periodicals should encourage the masses to accuse and expose all waste phenomena, so as to form the most powerful supervisory force and public opinion force against waste. As long as the whole country is mobilized to launch a comprehensive conservation campaign, we will definitely be able to gradually eliminate waste and accumulate more and more funds for the great socialist construction.

### 展开全面节约运动

　　展开全面节约运动
    我们祖国正沿着社会主义工业化的道路迅速前进。到一九五四年，我国现代工业的总产值已等于一九四九年的四倍多，工农业总产值等于一九四九年的两倍多。而我国第一个五年计划完成的时候，预计全国工业总产值将比一九五二年增长约一倍，工农业总产值将增长百分之五十左右。经过几个五年计划，我们就能够建成一个强大的现代化的社会主义的工业国家。到那个时候，我们的国家将更加强大而繁荣，我国人民的物质和文化生活水平也将大为提高，我们世世代代的子孙将过着幸福愉快的生活。实现我国社会主义建设事业，是我国人民的伟大和光荣的任务。
    但是，实现我国的社会主义工业化，决不是一件轻而易举的事。我国社会主义工业化的计划，是以大力发展重工业为中心的计划。谁都知道，建设重工业是需要大量的长期的投资的。而我国工农业生产落后，小农经济在农业经济中占优势，资本主义工商业在工商业中占很大比重，因而国家资金的积累是缓慢的，这对于我们集中力量建设重工业是一个困难。克服这个困难对于保障第一个五年计划的后三年的任务的完成特别重要。根据五年计划草案的规定，五年中国家拨给重工业部、燃料工业部和机械工业各部的基本建设投资，约占工业基本建设投资总数的百分之八十左右，其中三分之二以上是集中在后三年支出。而五年中新建、改建的有巨大生产能力的企业，大部分要到一九五六年、一九五七年甚至到第二个五年计划期内才能完工投入生产。一方面投资数量一年比一年增多，一方面新的企业又不能很快地发挥投资效果，这一矛盾应当怎样克服呢？唯一的办法就是要动员全国的力量，在进一步发展生产的基础上增加资金的积累和在保证重点建设的条件下厉行节约。在目前，开展全面的节约运动更具有现实的严重的意义。因为它能最有效的节省资金，增加积累。例如，国营和地方国营纺织工业，最近根据中央的指示，重新研究了五年投资计划，在不影响五年计划进度的原则下停建、缓建了八十余万枚纺锭和几个全能织布车间和印染厂，并减少一部分预备费，立即就为国家节约了七亿元以上的资金。这笔资金可以建设一座年产一万五千辆拖拉机的工厂和一座年产一百万吨的炼油厂。如果所有用钱的部门，都能坚决停止不必用、不急用和可用可不用的开支，并在十分必要的开支中也厉行节约，我们就一定能够积累更多的建设资金，保证重点建设的顺利进行。
    为了展开全面的节约运动，就应该坚决反对目前在各方面的浪费现象。我们应该建立起经常的节约制度，树立勤俭朴素的作风，发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。一切社会主义企业，不论是在基本建设方面、生产方面、物资和商品流通方面，一切工作机关，不论是党的机关、政府机关或军事机关，都应该坚决贯彻节约的原则，并以自己的模范作用，带动全国人民树立起克勤克俭的风气。这是我国人民在建设社会主义社会以至建设共产主义社会的长时期的经常任务。任何工作机关，任何企业部门，任何工作人员，如果在节约问题上不采取认真的严肃的负责态度，随便浪费国家资财，那就是对国家对人民的犯罪行为。
    应该承认，目前的浪费现象是相当普遍的，特别是在工业、交通运输业和商业部门中，又特别是在这些部门的基本建设工程中，浪费更是严重。例如一九五四年重工业部各单位开支的窝工费约六百七十万元；第一汽车厂到一九五四年十一月底，只器材一项就积压了一千万元。当然，这类的浪费中也有一部分由于客观原因。基本建设的投资多，开支大，任何一项微小的差错，都会造成巨大的浪费；而我们目前的计划工作、设计工作和管理工作的水平很低，还不可能完全避免这些差错。但是，只要我们在思想认识上和实际工作中认真注意节约，很多浪费是可以避免或减少的。例如有些部门和地方国家机关，不分轻重缓急地盲目建设，这样造成的浪费就是可以避免的。有些部门或建设单位，不严格遵照基本建设程序办事，资源和工程、水文地质情况还没弄清就盲目设计和施工，结果造成大量的浪费。燃料工业部的蛟河中岗竖井、北票台吉竖井、鸡西小恒山竖井、新邱二号矿和光义竖井，就是因为这些原因，以致钻进数百公尺后发现无煤而中途作废，或者开凿中发现流沙和涌水被迫停工，或者钻探了数万公尺仍提不出地质报告。这类的浪费难道也是完全不可避免的吗？这种现象难道还能够让它继续存在下去吗？
    除了基本建设部门以外，生产部门、交通运输部门、商品流转部门的浪费也不小。它们主要表现了放松财务成本的管理，资金周转缓慢，原材料、燃料消耗过多，劳动组织很差，产品成本高、质量低、废品次品多，以及仓库保管不好等等方面。以企业的管理经费来看，目前就存在很悬殊的现象。例如国营青岛第一棉纺织厂和国营上海第九棉纺织厂，设备规模都相似，但一九五四年车间经费的开支，后者比前者高一倍多。又如以石岘纸厂和吉林纸厂做比较，每吨新闻纸分摊的管理费用，前者是三十八点三元，后者是十五点六四元。假如我们努力减少原材料的消耗，降低产品成本，就可以节约很多。比如，一九五四年每箱纸烟用的烟叶最高为一百三十斤，最低的是一百二十点五斤；今年一月份上海地方公私合营棉纺厂每件棉纱的用棉量，最高为三百九十四斤，最低为三百八十六斤。如果全国制烟厂和棉纺厂都能达到或接近最低水平，就可以节约很多烟叶和棉花。再如一九五四年铁路货物列车按规定指标欠重一千多万吨，单机行走超过计划三百多万公里，这就浪费了三百三十七万元；商业部单是一九五四年死猪、臭蛋就值八百万元。显然的，这些浪费也是可以减少或者可以完全避免的。
    在各级党的机关、政府机关、军事机关和文化教育事业机关中，经费开支和物力、人力的浪费现象也很严重。有些机关脱离群众的生活水平和国家的经济条件，任意建筑豪华的办公大楼、职工宿舍、疗养院和礼堂。有些机关无限制地增加汽车和各种家具，会议室、办公室、宿舍里摆了很多沙发和地毯。有些机关盲目地储备办公用品，其中有的部门购存的文具、纸张可供几年之用。事实上，所有高级机关的办公用费都还可以而且必须加以节减，这种节减对于全国的节约运动是有重要意义的。各个机关的粮食消费也必须节减。最近根据各省市机关重点检查证明，各城市特别是各机关的粮食定量普遍偏高，经过精打细算，按供应标准一般都可节约百分之六至百分之十左右。机关节约的另
  一项巨大任务是精简机构。我们的国家机关、事业机关、企业单位的管理部门的人员编制普遍地是过于庞大。例如中央一级的各部中，五千人以上的部就有五个，四千人以上的有一个，三千人以上的有四个，其它两千和一千人的部就更多了。根据初步计算，一般都可以抽调出百分之二十至五十。这说明机关人员编制是完全可以紧缩的。机关人员增多的结果不但严重地浪费了国家的财力，而且也严重地浪费了国家的人力。有人说：人多好办事。其实完全不是这样。机关人员增加了，服务事业和服务人员就势必也要增加，机关中的事务工作就越来越多，官僚主义和文牍主义的现象就越来越严重。领导机关人员增加了，不但从事生产性劳动的人力要减少，直接在群众中进行组织工作的人力也要削弱，而且高级机关中还有不少人员因为没有或很少工作而不安心。这又怎能把事情办好呢？
    节约是社会主义积累的根本方法。为了建设我们的祖国，各部门和各地方的领导机关必须合理地节约地分配和使用国家的资金；必须充分地利用原有的生产、运输和商品流转的设备；必须最大限度地降低建设和生产成本，降低各种流通费用；必须立即着手精简机构，确定定员定额制度，合理地使用人力；必须从各方面设法提高工作效率和劳动生产率。这是全国一切组织必须毫无例外地坚决执行的重大任务。一切违反节约原则的思想和行为都必须彻底加以反对，使它们没有容身之地。
    为了贯彻节约原则，必须认真地规定和健全各项定额，必须严格地审查预算和决算，必须逐步规定和推广严密的财政制度和财政监督制度。全体国家工作人员都必须严格地遵守财政纪律，并且向那些缺乏经济观点、破坏财政纪律、浪费国家资金的人展开斗争，给予各种应得的处分直至刑事的处分。
    为了反对浪费，厉行节约，为了实行财政监督，严格财政纪律，必须依靠广大的人民群众，离开群众是不可能达到目的的。全国每一个组织，每一个生产单位和工作单位，都应当发动全体群众用主人翁的态度来对待公共的财产和国家的资金，对本单位的收入支出的计划和执行结果进行彻底的检查，揭发各方面的缺点和错误，提出各种改进的建议，并且监督它们的实现。各个单位都应当根据具体情况，定出按月实行群众监督的各种办法，使它们成为普遍性的和永久性的制度。党和国家的监察机关，党和国家的报刊，都要鼓励群众对于一切浪费现象的控告和揭露，以便形成反对浪费的最强大的监督力量和舆论力量。只要全国上下一致动员起来，展开全面的节约运动，那么，我们就一定能够逐步地扑灭浪费，为伟大的社会主义建设积累愈来愈多的资金。
