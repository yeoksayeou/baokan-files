　　In a New Position
　　Lan Ping
    One winter night, drill number 512 had penetrated 68 meters into the earth when suddenly the mud circulation fluid in the borehole began to leak. The mud pump was working hard, but the circulation fluid still couldn't be pumped up to the wellhead. Under these circumstances, drilling couldn't continue. The squad leader ordered the engine to be shut down, and the recorder quickly took a wooden marker to measure the water level, measuring several times and finding the water surface at 44 meters. He reported this situation to the old machine chief, Fang Luhe. After considering it for a while, the chief decided to plug the leak at 44 meters. People busied themselves changing drill bits, mixing mud balls... At one o'clock in the morning, the incoming shift arrived, including a burly man who silently took the rock cores collected by the shift and examined them carefully. He took out a small notebook from his pocket, checked it, and walked up to the chief, saying, "The leak isn't at 44 meters; it's at the bottom of the hole!"
    The chief said in surprise, "People have measured it several times!" The man who offered the opinion replied that, according to his records, the borehole had leaked several times before, but never at 44 meters; moreover, the rock strata at all previous leak locations were the same as the rock cores just taken from the bottom of the hole. The workers surrounded them, and some confirmed what he said. The chief, Fang Luhe, had just returned from convalescing in Lintong and wasn't very familiar with the new borehole's situation. After hearing this, he changed his decision and adopted the suggestion to plug the leak at the bottom of the hole. Sure enough, the mud ball plugged the leak as soon as it was thrown to the bottom, and the engine roared back to life, the drilling rig returning to normal operation.
    This person who made the suggestion to the chief is Zhang Zhengxiang, a worker on drill number 512, whom people affectionately and respectfully call "Old Scholar." Not long ago, he was a soldier in the People's Volunteer Army. In July 1954, he transferred to the Northwest Geological Bureau's 641st team based on the needs of the motherland's construction. The squad leader in his team was only nineteen years old, the deputy squad leader was twenty, and all the technicians and apprentices were young people of similar age, while he was already thirty-three years old, which is why he seemed "old."
    On the Korean battlefield, this "Old Scholar" led more than twice as many soldiers as his current squad, independently performing the duties of an air defense sentry. During the Battle of Shangganling, his post was on a transportation route in the enemy's "key blockade zone." One night, the enemy planes strafed and bombed fiercely for a long time, and all the air defense signal flares were used up. Zhang Zhengxiang led several soldiers, braving the rain of bullets, to stand at the crossroads and direct the large numbers of vehicles and personnel passing through by shouting. Bombs exploded nearby, bullets whizzed overhead, and even the air currents from the enemy planes' dives moved their cotton uniforms, but they didn't care and persisted in directing traffic. Enemy planes dived and dropped bombs more than ninety times in one night, but thanks to their heroic and skilled direction, the passing vehicles and personnel suffered no losses. This was just one of his many heroic deeds. It was he who had now come to the motherland's interior and joined the ranks of the drilling team, the vanguard of industrial construction.
    The change of position brought him many difficulties. On his first day at the mining area, he saw the drill rods spinning quickly and the machine roaring, but who knew what the situation was hundreds of meters below, out of sight? The hole was so deep, how could he work? The chief saw his mood and said gently, "You're new here and don't understand the situation yet. Take a look first, and start working in a few days!" He was relieved and watched from the sidelines. But just watching wasn't satisfying, so he learned to pick up the slip fork, and when the drill rod was lifted, he would fork it. However, he was clumsy, unable to quickly fork the right place. Putting down the slip fork, he climbed the drill tower. The drill tower, more than sixteen meters high, shook violently in the wind, and before he reached the top, he felt dizzy and unable to stand. He tried to help others tighten the drill rods, but one type had a reverse thread, which he didn't know, and he strained with all his might, sweating profusely, but couldn't tighten it. He was distressed.
      "How will I work in the future! Should I request to return to the army? This kind of thing isn't for people who carry guns." This thought, along with the increasing difficulties in his work, increasingly troubled Zhang Zhengxiang. At this time, he couldn't help but think of what the political commissar had said to them when they were about to leave: "In the past, you stood on the front line of defending the motherland; in the future, you will still stand on the front line of building the motherland." His ideological struggle continued for a long time, and he concluded: "In the past, I went in and out of the rain of bullets to defend the motherland. Now, in a peaceful environment, I'm handling machines, I must not retreat. If I don't know how, I'll learn. I must master this skill!" So he made a study plan. He asked questions whenever he didn't understand something at work, or looked up books when he encountered problems. He had a souvenir booklet given by a comfort delegation to Korea, filled with detailed notes on his daily work, study心得, good experiences, etc., never missing a day. Usually, he would always ask others to give him a "situation" to test him, and if he answered incorrectly, he would have the person who gave him the question explain it to him again. One day after work, comrades were talking about how quickly the footage had progressed this time, and he quickly asked: "I was giving feed today, and I heard the bottom of the hole making a sound like a donkey eating peas,咯迸咯迸. If normal drilling is like this, right?" Everyone laughed, thinking that his learning spirit was really good. When he served as the squad recorder, because he didn't know how to use an abacus, he couldn't even fill out the squad's production report, stubbornly counting one by one on his fingers. If the numbers were too complicated, he would draw lines on paper and add them together. This took too much time, so he decided that he must learn to use an abacus. With the help of his comrades, he finally learned addition and subtraction. In this way, his technical level improved day by day.
    Because of Zhang Zhengxiang's high political consciousness and leadership experience, during Chief Fang's convalescence, the leadership appointed him to act as the chief. Although he knew that his technical level was not high enough and that being responsible for a drilling rig would be difficult, he still happily accepted the task and was determined to do the work well. He insisted on studying with everyone and leveraging the wisdom of the masses to solve problems. He himself devoted all his energy to his work. Once, during an accident, he didn't leave the site for five days and five nights. As soon as the accident was dealt with, he sat on the ground, still eating a bun, and fell asleep. At this time, the leadership sent a chief to help him, give him ideas, teach him methods, and give technical lessons, allowing him to complete the task smoothly.
    After this borehole was completed, he went to the engineering section to urge them to quickly level the ground for the new borehole. A technician in the engineering section said confidently to him, "There's still time!" Then he asked in reply, "How much time do you plan to use to remove the casing?"
    "Three small shifts!" he replied confidently.
    "Three small shifts?" The technician raised his eyebrows, seeming surprised, and then determined, "You won't finish in twenty days!"
    Indeed, removing the casing from this borehole was generally more difficult. The rock in this hole was soft, and three sets of casings were lowered, with a total length of more than 280 meters. Based on previous experience, sometimes a shift couldn't even remove more than a dozen meters. Therefore, this technician had his "basis." However, this time he miscalculated. When Zhang Zhengxiang first came to the mining area, he had seen other drilling rigs removing casing, which was both laborious and time-consuming. He thought to himself: Could it not be faster and more efficient? So he looked up books and consulted with old workers, learning that this was caused by carelessness when lowering the casing and that this situation could be changed as long as the technical measures were strictly followed. During his time as acting chief, he personally supervised the implementation of these measures, and as a result, it was completed in less than three small shifts. When the machine was moved to the new borehole, the ground was still not leveled. The technician who had determined that the casing couldn't be removed in twenty days came to the site, took a look, and quietly turned around and left.
    After only a few months of painstaking study, Zhang Zhengxiang's technology has now reached the level of a skilled technician. On the drilling site, you can see him holding the feed handle high, driving the sharp drill bit into the heart of the deep mountains. At this time, it is difficult to imagine the difficult situation when he started working. But he was not satisfied, and was constantly thinking about how to better master this weapon and quickly explore more treasures for the motherland.

　　在新的岗位上
　　蓝坪
    在冬天的一个夜晚，五一二号钻探机已经向地底钻进了六十八公尺，突然钻孔里的泥浆循环液开始漏失了，泥浆泵吃力地响着，孔口还是排不上循环液来。在这种情况下是不能再钻进的，班长指挥关了车，记录员迅速拿着木标测水位，测了几次都感到水面是在四十四公尺处。他把这情况向老机长方陆和汇报后，机长考虑了一会就决定在四十四公尺处堵漏。人们忙着换钻具，合泥球……。早晨一点钟，接班工人来了，其中有一个身躯魁梧的人，他一声不响地拿了这一班采上的岩芯仔细瞧了瞧，又从身上掏出来一个小笔记本查了一下，就走到机长面前说：“这不是四十四公尺处漏水，是孔底漏水！”
    机长惊讶地说：“人家都测了几次了嘛！”提意见的那个人回答说：根据自己的记录，以前钻孔漏过好几次水，都不是在四十四公尺处；而且以前所有漏水地方的岩层，都同刚从孔底采出的岩芯一个样。工人们把他们围住了，有人证实了他说的话。机长方陆和是刚从临潼休养后回来的，这个新钻孔的情况还不大了解，经这么一说，他就改变了决定，采纳在孔底堵漏的意见。果然，泥球一投到孔底就堵住了，发动机又以巨大的声音吼起来，钻机恢复了正常的工作。
    这个向机长提意见的人，就是人们带着喜爱和尊敬的心情，称呼为“老学工”的五一二号钻机工人张正祥。不久以前，他还是一名人民志愿军战士。一九五四年七月，他才根据祖国内地建设的需要转业到西北地质局六四一队来。他所在的班班长才十九岁，副班长二十岁，全班的技工和学工都是年龄相仿的年轻人，而他却已经三十三岁了，这就是他所以显得“老”的原因。
    这位“老学工”在朝鲜战场上带领着比现在全班还多一倍的战士，独立地执行防空哨兵的任务。上甘岭战斗时，他的岗位是在敌机的“重点封锁区”的交通要道。有一个夜晚，敌机疯狂扫射轰炸的时间很长，防空用的信号弹都用光了，张正祥就带着几个战士冒着弹雨站在十字路口，用喊话来指挥通过的大批车辆人员。炸弹在附近爆炸，子弹在头上呼啸，甚至敌机俯冲时的气浪把他们的棉军装都刮动了，他们都不顾，一直坚持指挥。一夜之间敌机俯冲投弹九十多次，但由于他们英勇熟练的指挥，通过的车辆人员未受到丝毫损失。这不过是他所有的英雄事迹中的一次而已。就是他，如今来到了祖国的内地，参加了工业建设的尖兵——钻探队的队伍。
    岗位的改变给他带来许许多多困难。刚来到矿区的第一天，他看见钻杆在飞快地转，机器轰轰地响，谁知道眼睛看不见的几百公尺的下面是什么情况？孔这么深，怎么能工作？机长看出了他的心情，就温和地对他说：“你刚来还不了解情况，先看看，过几天再开始工作吧！”他才放下了心，在旁边看着。可是，尽看也不是滋味，就学人家拿起垫叉，等钻杆一提上来就叉住，可是手脚显得很笨拙，老不能很快地叉到要叉的地方；搁下垫叉他又向钻塔上爬去，十六公尺多高的钻塔，被风吹的乱颤，还没到顶就觉得头昏眼花站不住脚；帮别人拧钻杆吧，有一种是反丝扣的，他也不知道，用了很大的劲挣的满头大汗也拧不动。他苦恼了。
      “今后怎么工作哩！还是请求回部队吧，这种事情可不是拿枪杆子的人干的。”这个思想随着工作中困难的增加，越来越烦恼着张正祥。这个时候，他又情不自禁地想到政委在他们临出发时所讲的话：“过去你们站在保卫祖国的最前线，今后仍然要站在建设祖国的最前线。”他的思想斗争延续了很久，得出的结论是：“过去为了保卫祖国出入于枪林弹雨之中，现在在和平环境里搬弄机器，绝不能退缩，不会就学习，一定要掌握这门技术！”于是他制定了学习计划。他在工作中不懂就问，或者碰到问题就查书本。他有一个赴朝慰问团赠送的慰问手册，上面密密麻麻地记满了每天的工作情况、学习心得、好的经验等等，从来没有一天间断过。平时，他老是拉着别人给他出个“情况”来考他，他回答错了就让出问题的人再给他讲。有一天下班以后，同志们谈论着这回进尺很快，他连忙问：“我今天扶给进把，听见孔底跟驴吃豌豆一样咯迸咯迸响，要是正常钻进怕就是这个样吧！”大家都笑了，认为他的学习精神真不错。在他担任班记录员时，因为不会打算盘，连班生产报表也不会填，硬是扳着指头一个一个地算，数目太复杂了，他就在纸上画一根一根的线往一块加。这样太花费时间了，他下决心一定要学会打算盘才行。在同志们的帮助下，他终于学会了加减法。就这样，他的技术水平一天天地提高了。
    由于张正祥的政治觉悟高，有领导经验，在方机长休养期间，领导上委派他代理机长的职务。虽然他知道自己技术水平还不高，负责一个钻机有困难，他仍然愉快地接受了这一任务，并且决心要把工作作好。他坚持和大家共同研究，发挥群众的智慧来解决问题。而他自己则把全副精力投在工作中，有一次出事故，他五天五夜没离开现场，事故一处理完，他坐在地下嘴里还吃着馒头就睡着了。就在这时候领导上派了一个机长来帮助他，给他出主意教办法，讲技术课，使他顺利完成了任务。
    这一个钻孔打完以后，他去工务科催促赶快平好新孔的地基。工务科的一位技术员胸有成竹地对他说：“来得及！”接着又反问：“你打算用多少时间取套管？”
    “三个小班！”他肯定地回答。
    “三个小班？”那位技术员扬了一下眉毛，好像很惊奇似的，接着断定说：“你二十天也取不完！”
    确实，他们这个钻孔取套管一般是比较困难的。这个孔岩石松软，下了三套套管，总长二百八十多公尺，根据以前情况有时一个班连十几公尺都取不上来，因此，这位技术员是有他的“根据”的。可是，这回却估计错了。张正祥刚来矿区的时候，曾经看见别的钻机取套管的情形，既吃力还费时间，他脑子就转念头：难道不能更快更省力吗？于是他就查书本并且请教老工人，知道这是下套管时粗心所致，只要严格按照技术措施执行，是能够改变这种情况的。在代理机长期间，他就亲自监督这样执行，结果不到三个小班就取完了。等机器搬到新钻孔时，地基仍然没有平好，那位断定二十天都取不完套管的技术员，来现场看了一下，就悄悄地转身走了。
    经过短短几个月的苦心学习，现在张正祥的技术已经达到了熟练技工的水平。在钻探机场上，你可以看到他双手高高地扶着给进把，驾驭着锋利的钻头，向深山的心脏刺去，这时，你很难想像到他开始工作时的困难情形了。但他并没有满足，经常在想怎么样更好地掌握这一武器，为祖国迅速探明更多的宝藏。
