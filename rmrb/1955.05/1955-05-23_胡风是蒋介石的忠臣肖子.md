　　Hu Feng is Chiang Kai-shek's Loyal Subject and Filial Son
　　Min Shui
　　I am a young man who grew up in the Southwest. After reading "Some Materials Concerning the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" and Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism," I am filled with boundless indignation. I have once again come to understand that this reckoning of accounts with Hu Feng is by no means merely a debate over ideological issues, but a sharp class struggle.

　　When I saw these secret letters, filled with the flavor of Chiang's news, bearing the dates "1945" and "1946," I couldn't help but recall Chongqing at that time. Just when Hu Feng was calling the Party "official," and cursing Party workers and progressive writers as "officials," "philistines," "local bullies," and "enemies," in the "Sino-American Special Technical Cooperative Organization" beneath Gele Mountain in Chongqing, the real officials were using whips "wrapped in steel wire," tiger benches, electric shocks, and chili water to torture comrades who were fighting for truth and revolution. However, the real officials, local bullies, and philistines were not whom Hu Feng sought to oppose. In the "Sino-American Special Technical Cooperative Organization," the flesh of revolutionary comrades was being torn apart, while the spy bosses Meiles and Mao Renfeng were laughing wildly... All this did not cause Hu Feng to have the slightest antipathy towards the real officials, local bullies, and philistines. Chiang Kai-shek's killing, arson, dictatorship, anti-democracy, etc., Hu Feng did not oppose. What he was enthusiastic about was how to use "whips wrapped in steel wire" and "smiles wrapped in insults" to deal with Party workers and progressive writers outside the Party; the cause to which he devoted unremitting efforts was how to seize leadership from the revolutionary forces! The only adversary in his eyes was five big characters: The Chinese Communist Party! Isn't this precisely Chiang Kai-shek's loyal subject and filial son? To what kind of "petty-bourgeois revolutionary nature and standpoint" does this belong?

　　Even today, Hu Feng is still continuing to "fight," attempting to preserve his "strength" by retreating, "While the green hills last, there'll be wood to burn." But, Hu Feng has miscalculated again after all! Hu Feng should be warned: On our land, in "such an era," there is not an inch of land for you to "retreat" to! Retreat and deception are all of no avail. Your false signboard of "petty-bourgeois revolutionary nature and standpoint" cannot cause people to have illusions or sympathy. People have long seen through you! People understand very well: If Hu Feng still had half a shred of petty-bourgeois revolutionary conscience, no, as long as he had half a shred of true Chinese conscience, he would not have regarded the Chinese Communist Party, which shed its blood and laid down its lives one after another in heroic struggle for the survival and happiness of the Chinese people, as "official"; he would not have slandered Mr. Wen Yiduo, a democratic figure who was killed in Kunming by bullets marked U.S.A., as "speculating"! It is not difficult to imagine that the officials now entrenched in Taiwan, after seeing these secret letters from Hu Feng, would greatly regret the exposure of his true colors!

　　Hu Feng's so-called "not only a simple writer, but also an organizer of literary work standing around the Party" should be read as an organizer of anti-communist and counter-revolutionary activities; Hu Feng's so-called "If it were not for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I would not have been able to find a place to settle down and make a living in the past twenty years" should be read as "Oh! That accursed Marxism and the army it armed! If you were destroyed, then I would have long ago 'operated' 'subjectively' and 'integrated a great will into China'; then I would have long ago 'taken the world as my responsibility,' 'everything is ready in me,' I will be above everything..." However, Marxism and the army it armed have not been destroyed, but are strong and invincible, so Hu Feng had no choice but to "bleed and walk"... Saying all the nice things, doing all the bad things! What a sheep in wolf's clothing, a swindler who deceives and swindles!

　　Whether attacking, retreating, or deceiving, the Party has seen all of this. The Party has defeated enemies more insidious and vicious than Hu Feng more than once. There is no weapon in the world more powerful than Marxism-Leninism. Every member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has only one way out: surrender to the Party and lay down your arms!

　　胡风是蒋介石的忠臣肖子
　　岷水
    我是一个在西南长大的青年。读了“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”及胡风的“我的自我批判”后，我是无比愤慨的。我再一次理解到这次对胡风的清算决不仅仅是思想问题的争论，而是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。
    当看到这些充满蒋记新闻气味的，署着“一九四五年”、“一九四六年”日期的密信的时候，我不禁回忆到那时候的重庆。就在胡风指党为“官方”，骂党的工作者及进步作家们为“官们”、“市侩”、“豪绅”和“敌人”的时候，在重庆歌乐山下的“中美特种技术合作所”里，真正的官方和官们正在用“橡皮包着钢丝”的鞭子，用老虎凳，用电刑，用辣椒水拷问着为真理、为革命而斗争的同志。然而，真正的官方、官们、豪绅、市侩不是胡风所要去反对的。在“中美特种技术合作所”里，革命同志们的皮肉被撕裂了，而特务头子梅乐斯和毛人凤在狂笑……这一切并不使胡风对真正的官方、官们、豪绅、市侩有半点反感。蒋介石的杀人、放火、独裁、反民主等等，胡风不去反对，他所热心的是如何用“橡皮包着钢丝”的“鞭子”、“用微笑包着侮蔑”，来对付党的工作人员和党外进步作家；他所致力不懈的事业是如何向革命势力夺取领导权！他眼里的对头只是五个大字：中国共产党！这难道不正是蒋介石的忠臣肖子吗？这到底属于哪一种“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”呢？
    直到今天，胡风仍然在继续“战斗”，企图以退却来保存“实力”，“留得青山在，何愁没柴烧”。但是，胡风毕竟又打错了算盘！应该警告胡风：在我们的土地上，在“这样的时代”里，是没有半寸可供你“退却”之地的！退却、欺骗，都是无济于事的。你的“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”的假招牌，并不能引起人们的错觉和同情，人们早就看穿了你！人们非常明白：如果胡风尚具有半点小资产阶级的革命良心的话，不，只要还有半点真正中国人的良心的话，那是不至于把为了中国人民的生存和幸福而抛头颅、洒热血，前仆后继，英勇斗争的中国共产党看成“官方”的；那是不会把被有U·S·A标记的子弹杀害在昆明的民主人士闻一多先生诬为“投机”的！不难想像，今天盘踞在台湾的官方和官们在看到胡风的这些密信之后，是会大大地惋惜他的真相的被揭发的！
    胡风的所谓“不仅是一个单纯的作家，而且是一个站在党底周围的文学工作的组织者”，应该读作是一个反共、反革命的组织者；胡风的所谓“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的”，应该读作是“呵！该咀咒的马克思主义及其所武装的队伍呀！要是你毁灭了，那我早就‘运行’着‘主观’，把‘一个大的意志贯穿了中国’；那我早已‘以天下为己任’，‘万物皆备于我’了，我，将在一切的一切之上了……”。然而，马克思主义及其所武装的队伍并没有毁灭，而是强大的，战无不胜的，所以使胡风不得不“一面流血一面走”……好话说尽，坏事做完！好一个挂羊头卖狗肉的，招摇撞骗的骗子手！
    进攻也好，退却也好，欺骗也好，这一切，党都是看见过的。党已经不止一次战胜了比胡风更阴险恶毒的敌人。世界上没有一种比马克思列宁主义更强大的武器。胡风反党集团的每一个人只有一条唯一的出路：向党缴械投降！
