The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways recently held an advanced workers conference in Lanzhou. The conference exchanged experiences in surveying, design, and construction, and awarded certificates to one hundred and seventy-four advanced workers and representatives of forty-three advanced collective units. Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Ministry of Railways, and others spoke at the meeting. The advanced workers present unanimously stated that after returning to the construction sites, they would work with all employees to strive to complete the surveying, design, and construction tasks of the new railway ahead of schedule, and to practice strict economy to reduce project costs for the country.

Many advanced collective units and advanced workers who participated in this conference have made outstanding contributions to the arduous work of building railways in the Northwest. For example, workers in the large blasting team on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway persisted in construction in the face of thin air and smoke when blasting on cliffs, ensuring the completion of the task. Jiang Yueshu, a fifty-year-old engineer, went deep into the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway site several times, climbed mountains two thousand meters above sea level, and often studied with employees and learned about the situation from farmers. Finally, he surveyed a shorter and better line, which, according to preliminary calculations, can save the country 30 million yuan in construction costs. Workers Liu Jingxia and Yang Yuguang created the bottom-pull and top-pull blasting methods to ensure the smooth progress of the project.

　　铁道部第一工程区在兰州举行先进工作者大会
    铁道部第一工程区最近在兰州举行了先进工作者大会。大会交流了勘测设计、施工等方面的经验，奖励了一百七十四个先进工作者和四十三个集体先进单位的代表。铁道部部长滕代远等在会上讲了话。到会的先进工作者一致表示，回到工地以后，一定要同全体职工一起争取提前完成新建铁路的勘测设计和施工任务，并要厉行节约，为国家降低工程造价。
    参加这次大会的许多集体先进单位和先进工作者在建设西北铁路的艰巨工作中有杰出的贡献。如兰新铁路上大爆破组的工人爆破跌落崖时，在空气稀薄、炮烟熏人的情况下坚持施工，保证了任务的完成。五十多岁的工程师蒋曰庶曾经几次深入包兰铁路现场，攀越拔海二千公尺的高山，并经常同职工研究，向农民了解情况，终于勘测出一条又短又好的线路，据初步计算可为国家节省工程费三千万元。工人刘景霞和杨玉光创造了底部拉火和顶部拉火爆炸法，保证工程能顺利进行。
