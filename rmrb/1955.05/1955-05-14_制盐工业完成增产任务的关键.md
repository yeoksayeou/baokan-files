The Key to the Salt Industry Completing Its Production Increase Task
Guan Yijian, Deputy Director of the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry

    In 1955, the production plan for salt fields under the Ministry of Light Industry is to increase by 30 percent compared to the actual production in 1954. This task is proposed based on the development of the national economy and the balance of production and sales. We must ensure its completion and strive to exceed it.

    Are there conditions for striving to overfulfill the state plan? Yes, there are. First, according to the forecast of the Central Meteorological Observatory, the weather conditions this year, especially during the peak production season for sea salt in April, May, and June, are normal. Second, the production preparation work done last winter and this spring was relatively good. Generally, the salt fields and pond beds have been repaired. In particular, the four major sea salt areas have widely promoted the advanced experience of "extracting brine under ice" (i.e., using ice to extract brine) created by Comrade Liu Guoxi, producing brine with a concentration of over 10 degrees, accounting for more than 25 percent of the annual brine demand for salt production. With a certain amount of brine, by April 20th this year, the salt produced in the four major sea salt areas alone increased by 43.53 percent compared to the same period last year. Third, last winter and this spring, the Salt Affairs Bureau and salt affairs departments at all levels ran production training classes, and more than 1,000 technical team leaders and more than 120 field managers, workshop directors, and union chairmen in the four major sea salt areas have been trained, and their production technical levels have been improved to a certain extent. Fourth, since the Sixth National Salt Affairs Conference last year, all localities have initially established and improved functional organizations for production technology based on the conference decisions, strengthened the grassroots level, and strengthened leadership over production. Fifth, with the development of mutual aid and cooperation in salt production, many individual salt farmers have gradually shifted to the track of collective production. The production volume after being organized is more than 15 percent higher than that of general individual households. Sixth, last year and this year, the state has allocated a lot of basic construction investment and technical organizational measures funds to the salt industry department. As long as we make full use of the existing equipment and strive to put this year's basic construction projects into production as soon as possible, it will play a significant role in this year's production. However, we must also see the arduousness of completing this year's salt industry production increase task and the existing difficulties. Because salt production is an open-air operation, it is currently difficult for us to accurately grasp natural laws, fully utilize favorable natural factors, and completely avoid the impact of unfavorable factors. Moreover, our management level is still very low, our technical strength is very weak, our organizational structure is unreasonable and unsound, and conservative thinking and bureaucratic work styles among cadres are also quite serious. We must wage a resolute struggle against these difficulties and shortcomings in order to achieve this year's salt industry production increase task.

    In order to complete the production increase plan, we must continue to ensure a sufficient source of brine. In the past, the lack of brine during the peak season was the main reason for the low salt production. This year, advanced brine-making methods have been adopted, and although the amount of brine has increased by more than 18 percent compared to the same period in 1954, it is still not in line with the proportion of planned production increase in the four major sea salt production areas this year. By the end of March, about 75 percent of the brine required by the four major sea salt areas still needs to be completed by producing salt and making brine at the same time. At present, some units are satisfied with the amount of brine they have and have relaxed brine-making work, which is completely unfounded. Years of experience tell us that to have a sufficient source of brine, we must strengthen the work of collecting tides and storing water, and strive to collect seawater with a higher concentration. Because the higher the seawater concentration, the more salt content, the shorter the salt formation time, and the smaller the evaporation area occupied. However, many salt fields do not manage the tide collection work well. In particular, many salt fields do not close the embankments, pool openings, and sluice gates tightly, neglect inspection, and even let the tide water that has already been collected run away for nothing. In order to correct these shortcomings, each salt field should designate a special person to manage this work and formulate necessary responsibility systems. In terms of water storage, we should overcome the two biases of storing too little or too much water, and promote the flow and evaporation of brine to shorten the brine formation time. According to past experiments, doing a good job in "protecting brine on rainy days, draining diluted brine after rain, and nurturing brine on cloudy days" can increase production by about 10 percent. Therefore, we should improve the meteorological research group, do a good job in timely weather forecasts, effectively prevent unfavorable factors, and earnestly implement the technical measures for operations on rainy days.

    In order to complete the production increase plan, we must also improve the utilization rate of production equipment. The current salt fields generally have a small evaporation area, so some salt fields still have difficulty in obtaining brine sources even though they collect a lot of seawater. Last year, 30,000 crystallization ponds in the four major sea salt areas were not utilized. Therefore, on the one hand, we must gradually balance the area of salt fields, and on the other hand, we must make full use of abandoned ditches, depressions, and wasteland within the fields to expand the evaporation area. Since the start of salting this year, salt fields in Northeast China and other regions have used the existing labor force to expand the utilization of more than 4.1 million square meters of wasteland as evaporation area. This is worth learning by other salt fields. In terms of the utilization of power equipment, neither electric horsepower machines nor windmills are currently being fully utilized. For example, the horsepower water pump in the No. 3 Workshop of Dagu Salt Field was only operated for 118 days in 1954; the windmills that stopped working and were damaged in Huaibei Salt Field in mid-December last year averaged 23.1 percent of the total number of windmills every day. In addition, strengthening the maintenance and repair of equipment to reduce accidents is also an important aspect of tapping production potential.

    Salt production is highly dispersed and mostly manual, while the current management institutions and organizational forms are very unreasonable. The specific leadership of production and the labor education of workers are not done well enough, and equipment maintenance is also very poor, so absenteeism is serious and work-related injuries are numerous. In order to change this situation, three issues need to be resolved in this regard this year. Namely: First, strengthen the leadership of production teams. Each salt area should designate a special person to lead the production teams. This year, Huaibei Salt Field carried out institutional reforms, drew out cadres from the upper level, and added 280 foremen, which played a role in improving the grassroots production work. More importantly, the leadership should help the backward production teams and raise them to the level of advanced teams. For example, if the output of the backward teams in the Piziwo Salt Field in Northeast China is raised to the average advanced level, more than 20,000 tons of salt can be produced annually. Second, increase the labor attendance rate. Last year, state-owned and joint state-private salt industry enterprises across the country had a total of more than 13,000 workdays of absenteeism. This year, we should strengthen labor education and rectify labor discipline to reduce absenteeism. Third, due to the seasonality of salt production, a large number of seasonal workers participate in production every year, so special personnel should be designated to conduct operational technical education for them to improve their technical operational level.

    To achieve the increase in crude salt production, in the final analysis, it is a question of improving labor productivity on the basis of improving technology and rationally organizing labor. And launching labor competitions is an important method to improve labor productivity. At present, various regions have launched labor competitions and guided the masses to put forward rationalization proposals to solve key issues related to production. This is a good start, and it must be persisted in and expanded in a guided manner.

    Now is the peak season for salt production, and the national salt production plan for the second quarter accounts for more than 60 percent of the annual task. We should seize the time to do the above-mentioned tasks well, and earnestly solve some of the difficulties in the workers' labor and life, to ensure the completion of the second quarter production task and lay the foundation for completing and overfulfilling the annual production increase plan.

　　制盐工业完成增产任务的关键
　　轻工业部盐务总局副局长　关一键
    一九五五年轻工业部所属各盐场的产量计划要比一九五四年实际产量增长百分之三十。这个任务是根据国民经济的发展和产销平衡情况提出的，我们必须保证完成，并大力争取超过。
    争取超额完成国家计划，是不是有条件呢？有的。第一，据中央气象台预报，今年的气象条件，特别是四、五、六月海盐旺产季节的气象条件是正常的。第二，去冬今春生产准备工作做得较好，一般都对滩田、池板进行了修整，特别是四大海盐地区，普遍推广了柳国喜同志创造的“冰下抽卤”（即利用冰冻提制卤水）的先进经验，制出十度以上的卤水约占全年产盐需卤量的百分之二十五还多。由于有了一定的卤水，今年到四月二十日止，仅四大海盐地区所产的盐就比去年同期增加了百分之四十三点五三。第三，去冬今春盐务总局和各级盐务部门开办了生产训练班，四大海盐地区的一千多个技术组长和一百二十多个场长、车间主任、工会主席经过了训练，生产技术水平都有了一定的提高。第四，从去年第六次全国盐务会议以后，各地都根据会议决定，初步建立和健全了生产技术的职能机构，充实了基层，加强了对生产的领导。第五，随着盐业生产互助合作的发展，许多个体盐民逐渐转到了集体生产的轨道上来。组织起来以后的生产量，比一般单干户要高百分之十五以上。第六，去年和今年国家给盐业部门拨付了不少的基本建设投资和技术组织措施费用，只要我们充分地利用已有的设备，并争取今年的基本建设工程早日投入生产，就会在今年生产中发挥重大作用。但是，我们也必须看到完成今年盐业增产任务的艰巨性和存在的困难。因为盐业生产是露天作业，目前我们还难确切地掌握自然规律，充分利用自然的有利因素，完全避免不利因素的影响。而且，我们的经营管理水平还很低，技术力量很弱，组织机构不合理也不健全，干部中的保守思想和官僚主义作风也相当严重。我们必须和这些困难和缺点作坚决的斗争，才能实现今年盐业的增产任务。
    为了完成增产计划，必须继续保证充裕的卤源。历年来，旺季时期缺卤，是盐产量不多的主要原因。今年采取了先进制卤方法，卤量虽较一九五四年同期增加了百分之十八以上，但和今年四大海盐产区计划产量提高的比例相较，还是不相适应的。到三月末，四大海盐区所需的卤量还约有百分之七十五要靠以后一面产盐、一面制卤来完成。目前有些单位满足于现存卤水的数量，放松了制卤工作，是完全没有根据的。几年来的经验告诉我们，要充裕卤源，必须加强纳潮储水工作，争取纳足较高浓度的海水。因为海水浓度越高，含盐量就越多，成盐时间就越短，占用蒸发面积就越小。但是，很多盐场对纳潮工作管理不善，特别是有不少盐场对圈坝、池口、水门关闭不严密，疏于检查，甚至把已经纳进的潮水给白白地放跑了。为了纠正这些缺点，各盐场应指定专人管理这一工作，并制定必要的责任制度。在储水工作方面，应克服储水过少或过深的两种偏向，并促进卤水流动蒸发，缩短成卤时间。根据过去的实验，“雨天保卤、雨后排淡，阴天养卤”的工作做得好，可以增产百分之十左右。因此，应健全气象研究小组，及时做好气象预报，有效地防止不利因素，认真贯彻执行雨天作业的技术措施。
    为了完成增产计划，还必须提高生产设备利用率。现在的盐田一般都是蒸发面积较小，所以有的盐场纳入海水虽多，卤源仍很困难。去年四大海盐区就有三万个结晶池没有被利用。所以一方面要逐步平衡滩田结构面积，一方面要充分利用滩内废沟洼地，荒滩荒地，以扩大蒸发面积。从今年开晒以来，东北等各盐场利用现有劳动力，已经扩大利用了四百一十余万平方公尺的荒地作蒸发面积。这是值得其他盐场学习的。在动力设备的利用方面，无论是电动马力机和风车，现在都没有充分利用。如大沽盐场三车间马力扬水机，一九五四年只开动了一百一十八天；淮北盐场去年十二月中旬停用和损坏的风车，每日平均达全部风车总数的百分之二十三点一。此外，加强设备的维护检修，以减少事故，也是挖掘增产潜力的一个重要方面。
    盐业生产分散性很大，又多是手工操作，而当前的管理机构和组织形式又很不合理，对生产的具体领导和工人的劳动教育都做得很不够，设备检修工作也很差，因此缺勤现象严重，工伤事故很多。为了改变这一状况，今年在这方面要解决三个问题。即：一，加强对生产小组的领导，各盐区应指定专人领导生产小组。淮北盐场今年由于进行了机构改革，把上层的干部抽出来，增加了二百八十个工长，对改善基层的生产工作起了很大的作用。更重要的是领导上要帮助落后的生产小组，把他们提高到先进小组的水平。例如东北貔子窝盐场，如果将落后小组的产量提高到平均先进的水平，全年即可多产两万余吨盐。二，提高劳动出勤率。去年全国国营及公私合营盐业企业共旷工一万三千多个工日。今年应加强劳动教育和整顿劳动纪律，减少旷工现象。三，由于盐业生产的季节性，每年都有大批的季节工人参加生产，因此应指定专人对他们进行操作技术教育，以提高他们的技术操作水平。
    实现原盐增产计划，归根结底是在改进技术和合理组织劳动的基础上来提高劳动生产率的问题。而开展劳动竞赛又是提高劳动生产率的重要方法。目前各地区已在开展劳动竞赛，并引导群众提合理化建议，解决有关生产的关键问题，这是很好的开端，必须有领导地把它坚持下去和扩展开来。
    现在正是产盐的旺季，全国第二季度产盐计划占全年任务的百分之六十以上。我们应该抓紧做好上述各项工作，并认真地解决工人劳动生活中的某些困难，以保证完成第二季度生产任务，为完成和超额完成全年的增产计划打下基础。
