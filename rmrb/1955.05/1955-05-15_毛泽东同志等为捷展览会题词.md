Xinhua News Agency, 14th. The inscriptions of Comrade Mao Zedong and other leaders of the Chinese Communist Party for the Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia. The full text is as follows:

　　The Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia has given us a profound impression. The economy and culture of socialist Czechoslovakia have developed rapidly in the past ten years. This is the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the Government of Czechoslovakia, and the result of the hard work of all the working people of Czechoslovakia for their happy life. The rapid development of Czechoslovakia in industry, especially in the machinery manufacturing industry, has greatly strengthened the confidence of our people in the industrialization that is beginning, and foreshadows the ever-broadening prospects for the development of trade and scientific and technological cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia. We wish Czechoslovakia growing prosperity and strength, and we wish the friendship between the people of Czechoslovakia and the people of the People's Republic of China to be continuously enhanced and consolidated.
