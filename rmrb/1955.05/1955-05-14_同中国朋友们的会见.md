    Meeting with Chinese Friends
	Keluobowa, Head of the Soviet Trade Union Delegation and Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions
    The Soviet Trade Union Delegation, at the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, came to the People's Republic of China to attend the "May Day" celebrations. All members of our delegation were eager to become acquainted with the changes that have taken place in your country since the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    Friends from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have been very warm and attentive in their reception, giving us ample opportunities to become acquainted with the work of various factories, to talk with workers and trade union activists, and to visit museums, the National Art Exhibition, and parks.
    We have personally witnessed the truly magnificent construction achievements of the new China, which are the result of the great labor enthusiasm and creativity of the entire Chinese people. Everyone can clearly see that the Chinese working people have, in a very short period, restored the national economy that was destroyed by long-term wars and are implementing the Five-Year Economic Construction Plan, the task of which is to industrialize the country and carry out a massive socialist transformation of agriculture.
    In all the places we have visited—factories and institutions—we have felt the tremendous vitality, enthusiasm, and strong desire of the Chinese people to learn and work better, as well as their strong desire to successfully complete the tasks of developing the economy, culture, and science under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government.
    We have visited two cotton textile factories. These are new factories equipped with excellent domestically produced machines that were put into operation not long ago. All the young workers in the factories are working very well. There are already many advanced workers and model workers here. Particularly pleasing was seeing Comrade Yang Huijie, the director of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, a middle-aged woman who is serious and conscientious in her work, and a happy mother of four children when talking about her children.
    In the factory, she spoke to us knowledgeably about the work and her own studies, and she led us to visit the kindergarten and workers' housing.
    It should be pointed out that the factory's trade union organization has carried out a lot of cultural and educational work, organizing various amateur art groups, which are attended by about 40 percent of all workers.
    During a visit to a handicraft cooperative in Beijing, we saw unique Chinese handicrafts. What is most striking here is the willingness of people to contribute their labor to the common cause of the people. This willingness is not only manifested in the cities but also in the countryside.
    Our delegation visited Gaobeidian. Now, this village has an agricultural production cooperative, a credit cooperative, two schools, a cultural center, and a store. In the past, only 5 percent of the people in the village were literate, but now illiteracy has been completely eliminated. The village has a people's school, with 1,300 young people studying at the school. The middle school has chemistry, physics, and other laboratories, a music room, a sports field, and a garden. All the young teachers are carrying out tremendous cultural work in the village and have left a very good impression. People, whether young or old farmers, or their children, showed such joy and enthusiasm, and we received such heartwarming and kind hospitality that we could not bear to leave them for a long time. This extremely deep sympathy for the courage and love of labor of the Chinese people accompanied us everywhere.
    We participated as guests in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations. The great and solemn parade showed the tremendous political and labor upsurge of the Chinese people. The parade was beautiful and rich and colorful. Countless colorful bouquets, wreaths, float vehicles, and banners formed a garden of competing beauty. Here were the factory's work targets, finished products and models, and portraits of the leaders of the Party and the government. All of this made people feel the infinite love of the Chinese people for the Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Mao Zedong.
    Night fell. Tens of thousands of people poured into Tiananmen Square. When countless searchlights and fireworks filled the sky, the whole scene came alive. People were joyous, singing, and dancing. Their movements and expressions showed their determination towards great labor and more victories. It was truly unforgettable!
    Our delegation extends its heartfelt and sincere gratitude to our Chinese friends and wishes them great achievements in the cause of building a new China.

    同中国朋友们的会见
　　苏联工会代表团团长
　　全苏工会中央理事会书记　柯罗鲍娃
    苏联工会代表团应中华全国总工会的邀请，来到中华人民共和国参加“五一”节观礼。我们代表团的全体团员都很想熟识一下贵国在中华人民共和国成立后所发生的变化。
    中华全国总工会的朋友们非常热情和殷勤地招待我们，给我们充分的机会来熟识各个工厂的工作，同工人和工会积极分子谈话，参观博物馆、全国美术展览会和游览公园。
    我们亲眼看到了新中国的建设成就真是宏伟壮丽，并且是全中国人民的巨大劳动热情和创造的成果。人人都清清楚楚地看到，中国劳动人民在极短的时期中恢复了被长期战争破坏的国民经济，并且实施了五年经济建设计划，这个计划的任务是使国家工业化和对农业进行巨大的社会主义改造。
    在我们所到过的各个地方——工厂和机关里，我们都感到中国人民那种巨大的生命力、热情和更好地学习、工作的强烈愿望，以及在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下成功地完成发展经济、文化和科学事业中的任务的强烈愿望。
    我们曾经访问过两个棉纺织厂。这是两座不久以前才投入生产的、用优良的国产机器装备的新工厂。工厂的全体青年工人工作得很好。这里已经有很多的先进工作者和劳动模范。特别令人愉快的，就是看见了国营北京第一棉纺织厂厂长杨慧洁同志，她是一位在工作中严肃认真的中年妇女，而当谈到孩子们的时候，她是一个教养四个孩子的幸福的母亲。
    在工厂中她深谙事理地向我们谈了有关工作和她自己的学习的情况，她领着我们参观了幼儿园和工人住宅。
    应当指出，工厂的工会组织进行了很多的文化教育工作，组织各种业余艺术小组，参加这些小组的约占全体工人的百分之四十。
    在访问北京市的一个工艺合作社的时候，我们看到了中国特有的工艺品。在这里首先引人注意的是人们把自己的劳动贡献于人民共同事业的意愿。人们的这种意愿不仅表现在城市中，也表现在农村中。
    我们代表团曾访问过高碑店。现在，这个村子有一个农业生产合作社、一个信用合作社、两所学校、一所文化馆和一家商店。从前村中只有百分之五的人识字，而现在文盲全部被扫除了，村里设有民校，有一千三百个少年在学校学习。中学里设有化学、物理和其他实验室，有音乐室，有运动场和花园。全体青年教师在村里进行巨大的文化工作，并且留下了极好的影响。人们，不论是年轻的农民和年老的农民，也不论是他们的孩子都表现了这样的高兴和热情，我们受到他们的感人心灵的亲切招待，使我们很久不能离开他们。这种对中国人民的勇敢和热爱劳动的极其深切的同情，无论在什么地方都伴随着我们。
    我们以客人的资格参加了庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的观礼。伟大庄严的游行表明了中国人民的政治和劳动的巨大高涨。游行队伍是美丽和丰富多采的。无数五光十色的花束、花环、图表车和标语牌形成一个百花争艳的花园。这里有工厂的工作指标、成品和模型、党和政府领导人员的画像。所有的这一切都使人感觉到中国人民对中国共产党和它的伟大领袖毛泽东的无限热爱。
    夜幕降临了。成千上万的人涌向天安门广场。当无数探照灯光和焰火布满天空的时候，全场都动起来了。人们在欢乐、歌唱和跳舞。他们的动作和他们的表情表明了对巨大的劳动、对更多的胜利的决心。这真是令人难以忘怀的！
    我们代表团向中国朋友们致以衷心的、真诚的谢意，并祝在建设新中国的事业中获得巨大成就。
