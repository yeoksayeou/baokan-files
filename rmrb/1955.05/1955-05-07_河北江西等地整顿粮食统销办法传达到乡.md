Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 6th. Hebei Province had universally conveyed the measures for rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work to the county level by May 5th, and some counties are holding meetings to deploy the work to districts and townships. After the Hebei Provincial People's Committee and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an emergency instruction on continuing to rectify rural grain unified purchase and sales work on April 28th, Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Second Secretary Ma Guorui, Deputy Secretary Zhang Chengxian, Gu Yunting and others went to various districts to hold county party secretary meetings to deploy the rectification work. At the meeting, Handan, Xingtai, and Shijiazhuang districts analyzed the problems in grain supply work on a county-by-county basis, criticized the erroneous understanding of some county cadres who believed that "unified purchase and sales make-up lessons are almost over" and "make-up lessons are just making up grain," and redeployed forces and arranged rectification work according to the conditions of each county. During the communication and discussion in Tianjin District, the Secretary of the CPC District Committee helped the counties to carefully calculate accounts. After the calculation, the entire district not only would not break the supply standard, but could also save 10 million to 20 million catties of grain. Now, the counties in Baoding and Shijiazhuang districts are holding county and district cadre meetings to further specifically deploy the unified purchase and sales rectification work.

This newspaper reports that Jiangxi Province is carrying out the rectification of grain unified purchase and sales work around spring plowing production, correcting unreasonable phenomena in grain supply and boosting the production enthusiasm of farmers. According to statistics from seven townships in Jinxian County, a total of more than 254,000 catties of grain that were under-supplied and over-supplied, and should not have been supplied, were adjusted through rectification, and more than 54,000 catties of grain that were over-supplied and under-supplied, and should have been supplied but were not, were additionally supplied. Qishan Township, the fifth district of Leping County, originally requested more than 100,000 catties of grain, but after careful research, it was reduced to 45,000 catties. The Communist Party branch and the People's Congress of Longwo Township in the sixth district of Xingan County held a meeting to study grain unified purchase and sales work and learn grain unified purchase and sales policies. At the meeting, 24 households voluntarily reported that they had under-supplied 2,400 catties of grain. The whole township re-verified the supply quantity according to the actual situation. The supply of rice for 478 households was reduced by more than 67,000 catties, and more than 48,000 catties were supplied to 348 households whose original supply was insufficient. This not only guaranteed the needs of the masses, but also saved more than 19,000 catties of grain for the state.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th. Hubei Province has deployed the rectification of grain unified purchase and sales work to all townships before May 5th. Most of the cadres from six districts and more than 70 counties and cities in the province have gone to the countryside to participate in the rectification of grain unified purchase and sales work. The work of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives and leading rural production is also closely integrated with the work of rectifying unified purchase and sales. Secretaries and members of the local party committees, county party committees, and district committees of the Chinese Communist Party have gone to various places to convey, deploy, supervise and inspect the progress of work.

At present, the grain unified purchase and sales rectification work groups in various places are assisting the CPC township branches and township people's committees to convene township people's representative congresses or village mass meetings to comprehensively publicize the state's grain supply policies to the masses. Blackboards, big-character posters, and broadcasting tubes scattered in every village are spreading a large amount of news about the rectification work these past two days.

After a week of hard work, the daily sales volume of grain in many counties has turned from an unreasonable upward trend to a downward or stable one. According to the information learned by the Hubei Provincial Grain Department on May 4th and 5th, among the 23 counties in Xiangyang, Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Yichang districts, the grain sales volume in 13 counties began to decline, 7 counties turned stable, and only 3 counties had rising sales due to slow progress in work.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 5th. The work of rectifying grain unified purchase and sales in Hebei Province has been fully launched. In early April, the counties and banners of Hebei Province deployed the work of rectifying unified purchase and sales at the three-level cadre meetings for grain "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales." At present, some counties have completed the rectification, and some counties have also completed this work in about half of the rural areas. After rectification, the original grain sales targets can generally meet the actual needs of grain-deficient farmers.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd. The rectification of grain unified purchase and sales work in more than 1,100 townships in Suzhou District, Jiangsu Province, has basically ended. The newly formulated grain supply plans in most townships are generally 20% to 30% lower than the original plans, and some townships are more than 70% lower. The average daily grain sales volume in the district in April decreased by about 5% compared with March, and there is still a continuing downward trend. The transaction volume of more than 230 restored state-owned grain markets has also greatly increased. The transaction volume in the market in 20 days of April increased by more than double compared with the first quarter, and the average daily market volume in late April in some markets was about six times higher than the average daily number in early April.

　　河北江西等地整顿粮食统销办法传达到乡
    新华社保定六日电　河北省在五月五日前已把整顿粮食统销工作的措施普遍传达到县，部分县正召开会议向区、乡布置。四月二十八日河北省人民委员会和中共河北省委发出继续整顿农村粮食统销工作的紧急指示后，中共河北省委书记林铁、第二书记马国瑞、副书记张承先、谷云亭等人，分别到各专区召开县委书记会议布置整顿工作。会议上，邯郸、邢台、石家庄专区，以县为单位按粮食供应工作中的问题进行了分析，对部分县的干部认为“统销补课已差不多了”和“补课就是补粮”的错误认识进行了批判，并根据各县情况重新部署力量，安排了整顿工作。天津专区在传达讨论时，中共地委书记帮助各县仔细算账，经算账后，全专区不仅供应标准不会被突破，反而可节约粮食一千到二千万斤。现在保定、石家庄专区各县正召开县、区干部会议进一步具体布置统销整顿工作。
    本报讯　江西省围绕春耕生产展开整顿粮食统销工作，纠正了粮食供应中的不合理的现象，鼓舞了农民的生产积极性。进贤县据七个乡的统计，经过整顿共调剂出缺少供多和不应供应的粮食二十五万四千多斤，补供应了缺多供少和该供应未供应的粮食五万四千多斤。乐平县第五区岐山乡原来要求供应十多万斤粮食，经过切实研究减少到四万五千斤。新淦县第六区龙窝乡中共支部和乡人民代表大会开会研究粮食统销工作，学习粮食统销政策，会上有二十四户自报少供应粮食二千四百多斤。全乡根据实际情况复核供应数量，有四百七十八户核减大米六万七千多斤，对原来供应不足的三百四十八户多供应四万八千多斤。这样既保证了群众的需要，又为国家节余粮食一万九千多斤。
    新华社武汉六日电　湖北省整顿粮食统销工作在五月五日以前已全部布置到乡。全省六个专区和七十多个县、市的大部分干部都已到乡村去参加整顿粮食统销工作。整顿农业生产合作社和领导农村生产的工作也和整顿统销工作紧密结合进行。中共各地委、县委、区委会的书记和委员，都到各地传达布置和督促检查工作的进行。
    目前，各地的整顿粮食统销工作组正在协助中共乡支部和乡人民委员会，召开乡人民代表大会会议或片村群众大会，向群众全面地宣传国家粮食供应政策。散布在每个乡村的黑板报、大字报和广播筒，这两天都大量传播了关于整顿工作的消息。
    经过一周来的艰苦工作，许多县的粮食日销量已由不合理的上升状况转于下降或平稳。据湖北省粮食厅在五月四日和五日所了解的情况，襄阳、黄冈、孝感、宜昌四个专区二十三个县中，有十三个县的粮食销售量开始下降，有七个县转趋平稳，只有三个县由于工作进行迟缓销量仍有上升现象。
    新华社承德五日电　热河省整顿粮食统销的工作，已经全面展开。四月上旬，热河省各县、旗在召开粮食“定产、定购、定销”的三级干部会议上，就布置了整顿统销的工作。目前有些县已经整顿完毕，有些县也在一半左右的农村中结束了这一工作。经过整顿的地区，原定的粮食销售指标一般都能供应缺粮农民的实际需要。
    新华社南京三日电　江苏省苏州专区一千一百多个乡整顿粮食统销工作已基本结束。大多数乡新制定的粮食供应计划一般比原来计划降低了百分之二十到三十，有的乡低了百分之七十以上。全专区粮食平均日销量四月份比三月份减少了百分之五左右，目前还有继续下降趋势。已恢复的二百三十多个国家粮食市场的成交量也大大增加。四月份二十天内上市成交量比第一季度增加了一倍多，有的市场四月下旬每天上市量高出上旬每天平均数六倍左右。
