To the Editor:

　　I am writing to you to reflect some of the chaotic situations in the ticket sales system at Shenyang Railway Station.

　　At Shenyang Railway Station, it is generally very difficult for ordinary people to buy sleeper tickets to major stations. Shenyang Railway Station stipulates that sleeper tickets are not sold in advance, and all sleeper tickets for the day are sold at 1:00 AM. Many people have to queue up early in order to buy sleeper tickets, usually having to queue up around breakfast time today to buy tickets for tomorrow. Even so, only those at the very front of the line have some hope, and sometimes even those in the front cannot buy a ticket. However, there are also some people who find it particularly easy to buy tickets, getting them almost whenever they want. This is truly a strange phenomenon.

　　Here's an example: Huang Wenxian, a full-time sports cadre in our organization's trade union, met many ballplayers while playing sports. One of the players from the "Locomotive Team" is a ticket seller at the Shenyang Railway Station City Business Office. At the end of January this year, the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Commerce organized Li Shangping, the head of the Technology Section, and Geng Renzhe, the deputy head of the Finance and Accounting Section, to transfer to work in Beijing, accompanied by family members, a nanny, and others, totaling eleven people, who needed to buy eleven sleeper tickets. They queued up at the station for two or three days before their departure and made requests to the station, all to no avail. Later, they turned to this Comrade Huang, who, through his ballplayer connections, effortlessly arranged for eleven tickets on the twelfth train the next day. The next morning, a person from the Bureau of Commerce was sent to pick up the tickets at around 6:00 AM. At this time, the line of people buying sleeper tickets at the entrance of the business office was already very long. The door of the ticket office was still closed. The person from the Bureau of Commerce who came to pick up the tickets knocked on the door and casually handed in a letter. The comrade at the business office immediately said:
  “Ah! You've come to pick up the delivery note?! Please come in.” The person picking up the tickets vaguely agreed and went inside. Not long after, the comrade at the business office told the people in line: "All the sleeper tickets for the twelfth train have been sold out."

　　It is worth noting that this situation is not an isolated incident at Shenyang Railway Station, but rather a widespread and long-standing issue. In February this year, our organization wanted to buy group tickets to Beijing, and because there were some family members and children, we requested the station to give us a few more sleeper tickets, but we only received four. However, Comrade Cheng Guige, the section chief of our organization, bought several tickets for himself alone through personal connections in the Railway Public Security Section. Wang Tian, the manager of the former Northeast Coal Industry Construction Equipment Company, waited six or seven days to buy sleeper tickets to Beijing due to a job transfer and was unable to buy them. Later, through an acquaintance who was connected to the Political Department of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, the tickets were obtained smoothly.

　　The chaotic ticket sales system at Shenyang Railway Station has affected the work and lives of many people. I urge the relevant leadership to pay attention to plugging the loopholes in ticket sales at Shenyang Railway Station.

### 沈阳车站售票中的一种奇怪现象

　　沈阳车站售票中的一种奇怪现象编辑同志：
    我向你们反映一些关于沈阳车站售票制度混乱的情况。
    在沈阳车站，一般的人要买通往各主要车站的睡铺票是非常困难的。沈阳车站规定不预售睡铺票，当天的睡铺票一律在子夜一时出售。许多人为了买睡铺票不得不早去排队，通常情况下买明天的票在今天早饭前后就要去排队。就这样，往往排在前头的几个人还有点希望，甚至有时就连前面的人也买不到一张票。可是，另外也有一部分人买票特别容易，几乎什么时候要就什么时候有。这真是一种奇怪的现象。
    有这样的事情：我们机关工会的专职体育干部黄文宪同志在打球中结识了不少球友，其中有“火车头队”的某队员是沈阳车站城里营业所的售票员。今年一月底，沈阳市商业局组织技术处处长李尚平和财会处副处长耿仁泽调到北京工作，随行有家属、媬姆等共十一人，要买十一张睡铺票。临走前的两三天就在车站排队，并且向车站要求都无效，后来求到这位黄同志，通过他们球友的关系一点也不费劲，马上答应在明天十二次列车中留给十一张票。第二天晨六时多，商业局派人去取票时，营业所门口买睡铺票的人已经排成一条“龙”了。这时售票处的门还在关着。商业局来的取票的人敲了敲门，随手递进去一封信，营业所的同志马上说：
  “啊！你是来取货单的？！请进来。”取票的人含糊地答应了一声就进去了。不多一会，营业所的同志告诉排队的人说：“十二次列车的睡铺票已全部售完。”
    值得注意的是，这种情况发生在沈阳车站决不是偶然的一次，而是长期以来普遍存在的。今年二月间，我们机关要买去北京的团体票，因为有些家属、小孩，请求车站多给几张睡铺票，结果只给了四张。但是我们机关的程桂阁科长通过铁路公安段的私人关系一人就买了好几张。前东北煤业建筑器材公司王田经理因调动工作买去北京的睡铺票等了六、七天没有买到，后来通过熟人托沈阳铁路分局政治部的人代买，很顺利地解决了。
    沈阳车站混乱的售票制度已经影响到很多人的工作和生活，我要求有关领导方面注意堵塞沈阳车站售票中的漏洞。　　　赵文钧
