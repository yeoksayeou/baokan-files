　　Reactions to Criticisms in This Newspaper
    On March 17th, this newspaper published an article entitled "Those Who Take Advantage of Public Property," criticizing the lack of strict systems in the financial management work of the Heilongjiang Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China, where some staff members, under the pretext of financial difficulties, had long borrowed state funds for extravagant spending. Cao Genquan, the branch president, Song Xiying and Chen Tiezhi, the vice presidents, and Wang Zhenwu and Wu Chun潔, the heads of the Rural Finance Section who had attempted to borrow money without repayment, have all sent letters of self-criticism. The Party and Youth League organizations of the branch have held Party and Youth League member meetings respectively to review and criticize this matter. A general meeting of all staff members was also held, at which the president made a self-criticism, and the masses were mobilized to further expose and examine problems in financial management. Those who owed money have all made repayment plans. More than 5,700 yuan has now been recovered, and efforts are being made to recover all outstanding debts in the near future. In addition, the organization of mutual aid societies has been strengthened. In the future, individual employees who urgently need funds due to financial difficulties will resolve this through mutual aid, and the administration will no longer lend money in any case.
