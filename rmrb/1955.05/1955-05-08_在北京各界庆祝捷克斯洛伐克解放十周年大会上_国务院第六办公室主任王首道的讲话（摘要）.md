Comrade Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

Today is the eve of the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia. We are gathered in Beijing to celebrate this glorious festival of the Czechoslovak people. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China, to extend our heartfelt and warm congratulations to the Czechoslovak people and the government of the Czechoslovak Republic.

Under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Czechoslovak people have traversed a glorious and combative path. The greatest achievement of the Czechoslovak people is that, with the help of the great Soviet people and their army, they liberated their motherland from the enslavement of Hitler's fascism and established a free and independent people's democratic state.

This great victory of the Czechoslovak people is the result of the long-term national liberation struggle waged by the Czech and Slovak nations. Under the influence of the great October Socialist Revolution, the people of all ethnic groups in Czechoslovakia strengthened their struggle for national freedom and independence. The Czechoslovak Republic, established in 1918, emerged as the Czechoslovak bourgeoisie seized the fruits of the national liberation struggle; the history of this bourgeois republic proves that under the conditions of the bourgeoisie holding state power, true freedom and independence cannot be achieved. The Czechoslovak people will never forget that this bourgeois republic, by succumbing to the will of imperialism in its domestic and foreign policies, led to the Munich betrayal and brought unprecedented national disasters in Czechoslovak history. Only under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and with the assistance of the great Soviet people and their army, did the Czechoslovak people win the victory of establishing a truly free and independent people's republic through their own heroic struggle.

The people's Czechoslovak Republic has embarked on the bright road of socialist construction with firm steps. On this road, the Czechoslovak people overcame serious difficulties, repelled the resistance of the enemy, and smashed the sabotage conspiracies of the imperialist agents. In the February events of 1948, the Czechoslovak people, with the united strength around the Communist Party, shattered the bourgeoisie's conspiracy to restore capitalism and defended the people's democratic regime. The Constitution of the Czechoslovak Republic, promulgated in May of the same year, further consolidated the people's democratic regime, providing a strong guarantee for the socialist construction cause of the Czechoslovak people. The various ethnic groups of Czechoslovakia have united in a truly free and independent people's republic, realizing national equality and freedom, and establishing genuine friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation among the various ethnic groups.

The election campaigns for the People's Committees and the National Assembly held in 1954 vividly demonstrated the political and spiritual unity of the Czechoslovak people, proved the high prestige enjoyed by the Czechoslovak Communist Party and government among the people, and proved that the people's democratic political and social system is the source of the ever-growing strength of the Czechoslovak people.

The Czechoslovak people have already achieved brilliant successes in socialist construction. The two-year plan for the restoration of the national economy and the first five-year plan for the development of the republic's economy and culture have been successfully completed. Socialist components have gained an absolute advantage in all sectors of the national economy except agriculture, and an unshakable foundation has been laid for the socialist transformation of agriculture. This means that the enormous task of building and transforming the entire national economy according to socialist principles, as stipulated in the first five-year plan, has been realized. During the first five-year plan period, Czechoslovakia's industrial production has more than doubled the level of 1937. According to the general line formulated by the Czechoslovak Communist Party, heavy industry has gained particularly rapid and strong development. Czechoslovakia has emerged in the world as a powerful socialist industrialized country.

On the basis of socialist industrialization, Czechoslovakia's agriculture has also embarked on the path of socialist development. During the first five-year plan period, socialist unified agricultural cooperatives have been established in almost 47 percent of rural areas, and a network of state-owned machine tractor stations, densely distributed throughout the countryside, has created a material and technical foundation for the development of socialist agriculture. The Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, held last June, adopted a resolution aimed at further increasing agricultural production. Since then, the Party and government have taken effective measures to create all necessary conditions for vigorously developing agriculture. The working farmers of Czechoslovakia are advancing along the road of agricultural collectivization with the full care and assistance of the Party and government.

The purpose of socialist production is to satisfy the material and cultural needs of the people. During the five-year plan period, the material and cultural living standards of the Czechoslovak people have also improved accordingly, with national income increasing by 59 percent. This year, the fourth price reduction was implemented, and the people in urban and rural areas have benefited particularly from the price reductions. At present, in Czechoslovakia, 97 percent of cities and villages have been electrified, there is one doctor for every 760 people, the annual population increase is 3.3 times that of the capitalist era, and national education, science, literature, and art have all greatly developed and achieved tremendous success.

All these achievements of the Czechoslovak people have aroused satisfactory praise in the socialist camp and among progressive people throughout the world. As the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China said in its congratulatory message to the Tenth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia last June: "These achievements have laid a solid foundation for the Czechoslovak people to build socialism, guaranteed the economic prosperity and further high tide of culture of the Czechoslovak people, and strengthened the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union."

All these achievements of the Czechoslovak people are inseparable from the assistance of the great Soviet Union. During the years of World War II, the Czechoslovak people forged a particularly solid friendship with the Soviet people. In the post-war period, the fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the Czechoslovak and Soviet people have developed more solidly. The great Soviet Union is the most loyal friend to each of us who were liberated in the 1940s, is our model for building socialism, and is the strong pillar of our peaceful democratic socialist camp. The friendly cooperation between each of our countries and the Soviet Union is the invincible guarantee of our strength. It goes without saying that we all unanimously cherish and cherish the friendship with the Soviet people.

We Chinese people also cherish and cherish the friendship with the Czechoslovak people. Over the years, in addition to receiving comprehensive and enormous assistance from the Soviet Union, we have also received significant assistance from Czechoslovakia and other people's democratic countries. We have received complete sets of equipment for power stations, chemical fertilizer plants, sugar factories, and film processing plants from Czechoslovakia. We have also received steel, petroleum, transportation equipment, and machinery and equipment needed by mining, metallurgy, and construction industries. Czechoslovak experts hired by our government have worked tirelessly to help our workers and technicians learn and master new technologies. This economic and technological assistance from Czechoslovakia is a strong support for our country's ongoing first five-year plan for developing the national economy. Trade between China and Czechoslovakia is growing rapidly, and cultural cooperation between the two countries is also developing more and more extensively. Currently, the "Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia," being held in Beijing, has been warmly welcomed by our people and has greatly inspired them. Recently, the delegation of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Jankovcova, visited our country, the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ulanhu, went to Czechoslovakia to participate in the tenth anniversary of the liberation, and the performances and competitions of the Czechoslovak National Song and Dance Troupe, the Liperetz Puppet Theater, and the National Volleyball Team during their visit to China, all fully expressed the deep brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples.

It is no exaggeration to say that the basis of our pride and confidence is the unbreakable friendship between the countries of our peaceful democratic camp.

Although the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples are separated by thousands of miles, the hearts of the two peoples are linked together. We Chinese people regard the achievements of the Czechoslovak people as our own achievements. Our two peoples will, together with the Soviet people, together with the entire peaceful democratic socialist camp, and together with all peace-loving people in the world, unremittingly strive against war and for peace.

Long live the glorious Czechoslovak people!
Long live the Czechoslovak Republic!
Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples!
Long live the friendship and unity of the peaceful democratic socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    在北京各界庆祝捷克斯洛伐克解放十周年大会上
　　国务院第六办公室主任王首道的讲话（摘要）亲爱的大使同志，同志们，朋友们：
    今天是捷克斯洛伐克解放十周年纪念的前夕。我们在北京集会来庆祝捷克斯洛伐克人民的这个光荣的节日，请允许我代表中国人民和中华人民共和国政府向捷克斯洛伐克人民和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府致以衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，走过了光荣的战斗的道路。捷克斯洛伐克人民的最伟大的成果，就是在伟大的苏联人民及其军队的帮助下，把自己的祖国从希特勒法西斯的奴役下解放了出来，建立了自由和独立的人民民主国家。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民的这个伟大的胜利，是捷克民族和斯洛伐克民族进行了长期的民族解放斗争的结果。在伟大的十月社会主义革命的影响下，捷克斯洛伐克各族人民加强了争取民族自由和独立的斗争。一九一八年建立的捷克斯洛伐克共和国，是作为捷克斯洛伐克资产阶级窃取了民族解放斗争的果实而出现的；这个资产阶级共和国的历史证明，在资产阶级掌握国家政权的条件下，不可能实现真正的自由和独立。捷克斯洛伐克人民永远不会忘记，这个资产阶级共和国以在对内对外政策上屈从帝国主义的意旨而招致了慕尼黑的出卖，带来了捷克斯洛伐克历史上空前的民族灾难。只是在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，在伟大的苏联人民及其军队的援助下，捷克斯洛伐克人民才以自己的英勇斗争取得了建立真正自由和独立的人民的共和国的胜利。
    人民的捷克斯洛伐克共和国以坚定的步伐走上了光明的社会主义建设的大道。在这条道路上，捷克斯洛伐克人民克服了严重的困难，打退了敌人的反抗，粉碎了帝国主义代理人的破坏阴谋。在一九四八年的二月事件中，捷克斯洛伐克人民以在共产党周围的团结的力量，击破了资产阶级复辟的阴谋，保卫了人民民主政权。同年五月颁布的捷克斯洛伐克共和国宪法，进一步巩固了人民民主政权，而使捷克斯洛伐克人民的社会主义建设事业获得有力的保障。捷克斯洛伐克各民族在一个真正自由和独立的人民的共和国内联合了起来，实现了民族的平等和自由，建立了各民族之间的真正的友爱、互助和合作。
    一九五四年举行的人民委员会和国民议会的选举运动，生动地证明了捷克斯洛伐克人民在政治上和精神上的团结一致，证明了捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府在全国人民中享有崇高的威信，证明了人民民主的政治和社会制度是捷克斯洛伐克人民的力量日益强大的源泉。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民在社会主义建设事业上已经取得辉煌的成就。恢复国民经济的两年计划和发展共和国的经济和文化的第一个五年计划都已胜利地完成。社会主义成分已在除农业而外的国民经济各部门占绝对的优势，对农业的社会主义改造也已奠定不可动摇的基础，这就是说，第一个五年计划规定的按照社会主义原则建设和改造整个国民经济的巨大任务已经实现。在第一个五年计划时期，捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产量已经超过了一九三七年水平的一倍以上。根据捷克斯洛伐克共产党制定的总路线，重工业获得了特别迅速而强大的发展。捷克斯洛伐克已以一个强大的社会主义工业化的国家出现于世界。
    在社会主义工业化的基础上，捷克斯洛伐克的农业也走上社会主义发展的轨道。第一个五年计划期间，已在几乎百分之四十七的农村建立了社会主义化的统一农业合作社，密布全国农村的国营机器拖拉机站网已为社会主义农业的发展造成物质的和技术的基础。去年六月捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会通过了旨在进一步提高农业生产的决议，此后党和政府更采取了有效的措施来为大力发展农业创造一切必要的条件。捷克斯洛伐克的劳动农民正在党和政府的充分关怀和帮助下沿着农业合作化的道路前进。
    社会主义生产的目的是为着满足人民的物质和文化的需要。在五年计划期间，捷克斯洛伐克人民的物质和文化生活的水平也有了相应的提高，国民收入增加了百分之五十九。今年，实行了第四次减低物价，城乡人民从减低物价中得到了特别的好处。目前，在捷克斯洛伐克，百分之九十七的城市和乡村都已实现电气化，每七六○个人就有一个医生，每年人口的增加数目等于资本主义时代的三点三倍，此外国民教育、科学、文学和艺术事业都有了很大的发展并获得了巨大的成就。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民的这一切成就，在社会主义阵营和全世界进步人类中引起了满意的赞扬。正如中国共产党中央委员会在去年六月祝贺捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会的贺词中所说：“这些成就，奠定了捷克斯洛伐克人民建设社会主义的稳固基础，保证了捷克斯洛伐克人民经济的繁荣和文化的进一步高涨，增强了以苏联为首的世界和平阵营。”
    捷克斯洛伐克人民的这一切成就是同伟大苏联的援助分不开的。在第二次世界大战的年代，捷克斯洛伐克人民同苏联人民就结成了特别巩固的友谊。在战后时期内，捷克斯洛伐克人民同苏联人民之间兄弟友谊和亲密合作有了更加巩固的发展。伟大的苏联，对于我们每个在二十世纪四十年代获得解放的国家来说，是最忠实的朋友，是我们建设社会主义的榜样，是我们和平民主社会主义阵营的强大的支柱。我们每个国家和苏联的友好合作，是我们的力量的不可战胜的保证。不言而喻，我们大家都一致地特别珍视和爱护同苏联人民的友谊。
    我们中国人民同样珍视和爱护同捷克斯洛伐克人民的友谊。这些年来，我们除了从苏联得到全面的巨大的援助外，还从捷克斯洛伐克和其它人民民主国家得到重大的援助。我们从捷克斯洛伐克得到发电站、化学肥料工厂、制糖工厂和影片洗印厂的成套设备。我们还得到钢材、石油、交通器材和采矿、冶金、建筑工业等部门需要的机器设备。受我国政府聘请的捷克斯洛伐克专家不辞劳苦地帮助我国工人和技术人员学习和掌握新的技术。捷克斯洛伐克这种经济上和技术上的援助是我国正在进行的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的有力支持。中捷两国的贸易正在迅速增长，两国的文化合作也得到日益广泛的发展。目前，正在北京举行的“捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会”受到我国人民的热烈欢迎，并使我国人民受到极大的鼓舞。最近，以扬科夫卓娃副总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团到我国来访问，以乌兰夫副总理为首的中华人民共和国政府代表团到捷克斯洛伐克去参加解放十周年纪念，以及捷克斯洛伐克国家歌舞团、利培勒兹木偶剧团、国家排球队在访问中国期间的演出和比赛，无不充分表达了中捷两国人民的深厚的兄弟般的友谊。
    可以毫不夸张地说，我们大家引以自豪并充满信心的根据就是我们和平民主阵营各国之间的牢不可破的友谊。
      我们中捷两国人民虽然远隔万里，但是两国人民的心却是联结在一起的。我们中国人民把捷克斯洛伐克人民的成就看成是我们自己的成就。我们两国人民将同苏联人民一起，同整个和平民主社会主义阵营一起，同全世界一切爱好和平的人民一起，为反对战争、争取和平而坚持不懈地奋斗。
      光荣的捷克斯洛伐克人民万岁！
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国万岁！
    中捷两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的友谊和团结万岁！
