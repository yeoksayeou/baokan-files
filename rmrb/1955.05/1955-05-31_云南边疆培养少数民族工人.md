Xinhua News Agency:

　　A group of local minority workers has emerged in the border regions of Yunnan. These workers are distributed in areas such as Xishuangbanna, Dehong, Honghe, and Nujiang. They serve in construction, wiring, tea production, and other work departments. Yang Kaidang, a Hani worker at the Xishuangbanna Tea Factory, only joined the factory in March of last year and has already mastered all the operating techniques for machine-made black tea. In Zhiziluo, where the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Region government is located, dozens of workers capable of bricklaying and brick and tile making have already been trained. In the iron factory recently opened in Fugong County within the Autonomous Region, there are already eight skilled hammersmiths and fitters who can independently manufacture iron farm tools.

　  云南边疆培养少数民族工人
    云南边疆地区已有一批当地少数民族工人。这些工人分布在西双版纳、德宏、红河、怒江等地区。他们服务在建筑、架线、制茶等工作部门。西双版纳制茶厂哈尼族工人杨开当，去年三月才进厂，现在已经掌握了机制红茶的全部操作技术。在怒江傈僳族自治区政府所在地的知子罗，已经培养了几十个能够砌墙和制砖瓦的工人。自治区内福贡县开办不久的铁工厂里，已经有八个熟练的锤手和钳手，能够独立制造铁质农具。　（新华社）
