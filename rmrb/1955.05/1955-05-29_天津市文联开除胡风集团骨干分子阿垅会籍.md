　　Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles Expels A'long, a Key Member of the Hu Feng Group, from Membership

　　(Our Newspaper) The people of Tianjin express unparalleled anger at the activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. They have written letters to the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Tianjin Daily, denouncing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and resolutely demanding that A'long, a key member of the Hu Feng group, be purged from the revolutionary ranks. On the 27th of this month, the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles Committee held an enlarged meeting. At the meeting, Li Jiye, Wen Gongyi, Zhu Xing, Wang Dajin, Wang Lin, Fang Ji, and others spoke. They unanimously pointed out that A'long, along with Hu Feng, had long been hiding in the revolutionary literary and art ranks, spreading reactionary remarks, using "cluster grenade" tactics and various insidious and vicious methods to carry out criminal activities against the Party and the people. Such counter-revolutionary elements must be purged and dealt with by the people's procuratorial organs in accordance with the law. The meeting finally unanimously passed the following resolution:

　　"Based on the materials published in the 'People's Daily' exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and the materials already obtained by this Federation, it is proven that A'long (Chen Yimen), a key member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, has long been engaging in anti-Party and anti-people conspiracy activities with Hu Feng, carrying out various slanders and defamations against Party and non-Party writers, and using various insidious means to undermine the literary and art movement and revolutionary cause led by the Party, especially causing serious harm to our Tianjin literary and art movement. We must not allow counter-revolutionary elements such as Hu Feng and A'long to continue to mix in the revolutionary literary and art ranks and undermine the revolution. Therefore, it is hereby resolved: 1. In accordance with Article 9 of the 'Constitution of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles,' A'long is expelled from membership of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and his position as a member of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles Committee is revoked. 2. It is recommended that the Chinese Writers Association expel A'long from membership of the Writers Association. 3. It is recommended to the Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate that necessary action be taken against A'long's counter-revolutionary crimes. 4. We warn the members of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles who are members of the Hu Feng group that they must thoroughly expose Hu Feng, criticize themselves, and turn over a new leaf. Whether or not their membership will be retained in the future will be considered based on their actual actions."

　　天津市文联开除胡风集团骨干分子阿垅会籍
    本报讯　天津市各界人民对胡风反革命集团的活动，表示无比的愤怒。他们纷纷写信给天津市文学艺术界联合会和天津日报，声讨胡风反革命集团，坚决要求把胡风集团主要骨干分子阿垅从革命队伍中清洗出去。本月二十七日天津市文学艺术界联合会委员会召开扩大会议。会上，李霁野、温公颐、朱星、王达津、王林、方纪等人作了发言。他们一致指出：阿垅长期和胡风一起，隐藏在革命文艺队伍中散布反动言论，使用“集束手榴弹”的战术和种种阴险毒辣手段，进行反党反人民的罪恶活动。对这种反革命分子必须加以清洗，并由人民检察机关依法处理。会议最后一致通过以下决议：
      “根据‘人民日报’发表的揭露胡风反革命集团的材料与本会已获得的材料证明，胡风反革命集团主要骨干分子阿垅（陈亦门）长期以来和胡风一起进行着反党、反人民的阴谋活动，对党与非党作家进行了各种诬蔑和诽谤，并以种种阴险手段破坏党所领导的文艺运动和革命事业，特别是给我们天津市文艺运动造成严重的危害。我们决不能容许胡风、阿垅等反革命分子继续混在革命的文艺队伍里破坏革命。为此特决议：一、根据‘天津市文学艺术界联合会章程’第九条，开除阿垅的天津市文联会籍，并撤销其天津市文联委员会委员职务。二、建议中国作家协会开除阿垅作家协会会籍。三、向天津市人民检察院建议：对阿垅的反革命罪行进行必要的处理。四、我们警告天津市文联会员中的胡风集团分子，他们必须彻底的揭露胡风，批判自己，重新做人。今后是否保留他们的会籍，将根据他们的实际行动予以考虑。”
