　　Giovanni Gronchi Elected New President of Italy
　　Togliatti Speaks on the New President's Inauguration
    Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 1st dispatch: According to TASS, the seven-year term of the current Italian President Luigi Einaudi will expire in May, and the Italian Republic recently held presidential elections. As a result of the election, Giovanni Gronchi, Speaker of the Italian Chamber of Deputies and member of the National Committee of the Christian Democratic Party, was elected as the new president.
    According to Rome political observers, there was fierce struggle among the ruling parties of Italy in this presidential election. Gronchi was elected president only on April 29th in the fourth round of voting. The three consecutive elections held on April 28th were declared invalid because no candidate received the necessary majority. The leadership of the Christian Democratic Party originally nominated Cesare Merzagora, the current Speaker of the Senate, as a presidential candidate, but only when Gronchi's chances of being elected were greatest and several other candidates withdrew from the election did Merzagora abandon his candidacy, and the Christian Democratic Party recognized Gronchi as the party's candidate.
    Most Italian newspapers gave a positive assessment of Gronchi's election as president.
    Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti made a statement to "Unità" reporters on the presidential election, saying that the Communist members of parliament had supported Gronchi's candidacy. He said, "It is important to point out the failure suffered by the Sherpa-Fanfani-Saragat leadership group, who attempted to turn the presidential election into a small factional activity, without considering the opinions within the Christian Democratic Party, especially the opinions of the three hundred left-wing representatives in parliament who represent the will of ten million citizens. Despite the reactionary group's use of intolerable and shameless means to exert pressure on members of parliament in order to please foreign countries, this group's plan was crushed by parliament." Togliatti expressed the hope that "during the new president's term, the Constitution of the Republic can be thoroughly and strictly observed."

　　乔瓦尼·格隆基当选为意大利新总统
　　陶里亚蒂就新总统的就任发表谈话
    新华社一日讯　据塔斯社罗马消息：由于意大利现任总统路易吉·伊诺第的七年任期将在五月满期，意大利共和国最近举行了总统选举。选举结果，意大利下议院议长、天主教民主党全国委员会委员乔瓦尼·格隆基当选为新总统。
    据罗马政治观察家指出，在这次总统选举中，意大利各执政党之间进行了激烈的斗争。格隆基是在四月二十九日第四次选举中才当选为总统的，四月二十八日连续举行了三次选举，都因为没有一个候选人得到必需的多数票而宣布无效。天主教民主党领导方面本来提出现任上议院议长契萨雷·梅查戈拉为总统候选人，只是在格隆基当选希望最大、另外几个候选人放弃竞选的时候，梅查戈拉才放弃了自己的竞选资格，天主教民主党才承认格隆基是这个党的候选人。
    大多数意大利报纸对格隆基当选总统作了积极的估价。
    意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂就总统选举向
  “团结报”记者发表谈话说：议会中的共产党议员曾经支持格隆基的竞选。他说，“要着重指出谢尔巴—范范尼—萨拉盖特领导集团所遭到的失败，他们企图把总统选举变成一种小派别活动，不考虑天主教民主党中的意见，特别是不考虑在议会中代表着一千万公民的意志的三百个左翼代表的意见。尽管反动集团使用不可容忍的无耻的手段，企图对议员施加压力，以讨好外国，但是这个集团的计划被议会粉碎了。”陶里亚蒂表示希望，“在新总统任内，共和国宪法能得到彻底的严格的遵守”。
