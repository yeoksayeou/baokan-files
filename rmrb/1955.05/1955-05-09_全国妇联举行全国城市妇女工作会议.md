Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation held a National Urban Women's Work Conference in Beijing from April 19th to 30th. The conference focused on discussing the fundamental tasks of urban women's work during the national transition period and several key current tasks. Zhang Yun, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, delivered a report and summary on these aspects at the meeting.

The meeting considered that the fundamental task of urban women's work is to further educate and organize working women of all ethnic groups and women of all social strata in urban areas, based on the overall task of the country during the transition period, to unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party, actively support and strive to participate in socialist construction and socialist transformation, and to struggle for the gradual realization of the overall task of the country during the transition period, for the further realization of the complete liberation of women, for the liberation of Taiwan, and for the defense of Far Eastern and world peace. Accordingly, the main work of urban democratic women's federations at present is to educate women to continuously raise their socialist and patriotic consciousness, cultivate lofty socialist moral qualities, and advocate the use of socialist ideological principles to correctly handle the relationship between individuals and collectives, and to correctly treat labor, marriage, family, mothers, and children. Gradually mobilize women to participate in production and work they can participate in, and educate housewives to do their housework well and serve family members engaged in social labor.

The meeting proposed that it is necessary to continue to overcome the feudal residual ideas and bourgeois ideological influences in society that discriminate against and undermine women and children. The meeting considered that the feudal residual ideas of arranged and restricted freedom of marriage still have a widespread influence, and capitalist ideas are corroding the working people and revolutionary cadres in all aspects. Some people have corrupt, degenerate, illegal, and undisciplined phenomena in marriage issues. Therefore, it is necessary to seriously and resolutely fight against such thoughts and behaviors, and it is necessary to strive to cultivate socialist moral qualities in love and married life. In addition, it is also necessary to regularly advocate that parents actively undertake the responsibility of educating their children. At the same time, it is also necessary to rely on the masses to actively develop children's childcare and maternal and child health work.

The meeting discussed that the current urban women's federation organizations should focus on the family members of workers and staff, family members of handicraft workers, female handicraft workers, rural women in suburban areas, and other working women as their main working targets, while also paying attention to carrying out work among the family members of private industrialists and businessmen, patriotic democratic women, and family members of patriotic democratic figures.

The meeting believed that strengthening the leadership of urban grassroots women's representative conferences and doing a good job in grassroots women's work is an important guarantee for implementing the above-mentioned tasks. At the meeting, the regular work content, organization, education, and close cooperation in work with street offices, neighborhood committees, and other relevant parties of the grassroots women's representative conferences were discussed.

　　全国妇联举行全国城市妇女工作会议
    据新华社七日讯　中华全国民主妇女联合会四月十九日到三十日在北京举行全国城市妇女工作会议。这次会议着重讨论了国家过渡时期城市妇女工作的根本任务以及当前几项主要工作问题。中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席章蕴在会上作了有关这方面的报告和总结。
    会议认为，城市妇女工作的根本任务，就是根据国家过渡时期的总任务进一步教育和组织城市各族劳动妇女和各阶层妇女，紧紧地团结在中国共产党的周围，积极支持和努力参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，为逐步实现国家过渡时期总任务，为进一步实现妇女的彻底解放，为解放台湾和保卫远东及世界和平而奋斗。据此，目前城市民主妇女联合会的主要工作是教育妇女群众不断地提高社会主义和爱国主义觉悟，培养崇高的社会主义道德品质，提倡用社会主义思想原则，正确处理个人和集体的关系，正确对待劳动、对待婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童。逐步发动妇女参加可能参加的生产和工作，并教育家庭妇女做好家务，为从事社会劳动的家庭成员服务。
    会议提出，必须继续克服社会上歧视和摧残妇女、儿童的封建残余思想和资产阶级思想影响。会议认为，目前包办和限制男女婚姻自由的封建残余思想还有广泛的影响，资本主义思想正从各方面腐蚀劳动人民和革命干部，有些人在婚姻问题上发生腐化堕落违法乱纪的现象。因此必须严肃地、坚决地同这种思想行为作斗争，必须努力培植在爱情和婚姻生活中的社会主义道德品质。另外，还必须要经常提倡父母积极担负教育子女的责任。同时，并应依靠群众，积极开展儿童保育和妇幼卫生工作。
    会议讨论了目前城市妇联组织应以职工家属、手工业者家属、女手工业者、郊区农村妇女以及其他劳动妇女为主要工作对象，同时注意在私营工商业者家属、爱国民主妇女和爱国民主人士家属中进行工作。
    会议认为加强对城市基层妇女代表会议的领导，做好基层妇女工作，是贯彻上述各项任务的重要保证。会议上，讨论了基层妇女代表会议的经常工作内容、组织、教育以及同街道办事处、居民委员会等有关方面在工作上密切配合等问题。
