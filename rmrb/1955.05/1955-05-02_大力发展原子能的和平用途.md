　　To practically promote and extend the peaceful uses of atomic energy, the Soviet Union has signed agreements with China, the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, and the German Democratic Republic regarding assistance in the peaceful use of atomic energy. This is the result of discussions in Moscow by delegations of scientists and engineers from the five countries, based on the statement made by the Soviet Council of Ministers in January of this year. This is a brilliant achievement of Soviet peaceful diplomacy. This is a new development in the great friendship between the Soviet Union and China and other People's Democratic countries.
    According to the provisions of the agreements, during 1955-1956, the Soviet Union will complete the design work for experimental atomic piles and elementary particle accelerators for the five countries of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Germany, will supply these countries with industrially produced experimental atomic piles and elementary particle accelerators and necessary materials, and will provide these countries with the necessary scientific and technological data on atomic piles and particle accelerators free of charge. The agreements also stipulate that these countries will receive guidance and technical assistance from Soviet experts, and the Soviet Union will also undertake the training of experts needed by these countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy. Due to this agreement, the five countries of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Germany will be able to establish their own modern scientific experimental centers in a short period of time and carry out their own research work on the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Chinese people warmly welcome this agreement. We express our sincere gratitude for the Soviet Union's assistance to our country in the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    This agreement vividly embodies the Soviet Union's consistent position of attaching importance to the peaceful uses of atomic energy; it specifically illustrates that the Soviet Union is taking measures in all aspects to seek the benefit of peace. Because the Soviet Union has extensively researched and implemented the peaceful use of atomic energy domestically, it has a foundation to sign such an agreement and comprehensively help other countries. In 1954, the Soviet Union established the world's first atomic energy power station. It is also building a power station with a capacity of approximately 100,000 kilowatts. In addition, the peaceful use of atomic energy has made great achievements in steelmaking, metallurgy, agriculture, medicine, and geological research, etc. For the benefit of mankind, the Soviet Union has never kept these experiences conservative and secret, but is willing to contribute these achievements to benefit all mankind. The Soviet Union's preparation to present a report on atomic energy power stations at the international conference on the peaceful use of atomic energy to be held in August this year is the best proof. Now, the Soviet Union is not only signing agreements with the five countries of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Germany to help them establish scientific experimental centers for researching atomic energy; it has also stated several times that it will expand the scope of countries it can help. Hungary and Bulgaria have already received such proposals and will soon hold talks to sign such agreements. It is conceivable that under the close cooperation of the countries in the peaceful democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, the achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy will truly become one of the most valuable treasures of all mankind, which cannot be monopolized by the atomic madmen in the United States.
    We have long pointed out that the different positions of the Soviet Union and the United States on the issue of atomic energy represent two sharply opposed lines on this issue: the line represented by the Soviet Union's position is to fully develop the peaceful use of atomic energy, resolutely advocate the prohibition of atomic weapons, and oppose atomic war. The line represented by the US position is to actively promote and prepare for atomic war, and to try its best to obstruct the peaceful use of atomic energy. The sharp opposition between these two lines is now even more clearly placed before the people.
    Anxious to use atomic energy for the slaughter of mankind, the United States has taken many practical actions to legalize atomic weapons. The US government has publicly declared atomic weapons as conventional armaments, in order to provoke an atomic arms race. It carries out atomic war clamoring from all aspects, and openly regards the threat of atomic war as the foundation of its so-called "position of strength" policy. In order to deceive the people, the United States also occasionally talks about the peaceful use of atomic energy. It even wants to use advertising techniques to play with what atomic ship to tour the world, trying to show that the United States also thinks of the peaceful use of atomic energy. However, the facts are very clear that since the United States began using atomic bombs to slaughter hundreds of thousands of Japanese people in 1945, people have only seen it constantly publicizing how many atomic and hydrogen bombs it has, resolutely opposing the prohibition of atomic weapons, and have never seen it use atomic energy in any peaceful undertaking. From this fact, we know that the United States' announcement to carry out so-called "cooperation" with Asian countries on the peaceful use of atomic energy will not have any real peaceful significance other than to plunder atomic raw materials from Asian countries.
    To truly use atomic energy for peaceful purposes, it is necessary to stop using it for the purposes of war and slaughter. The use and production of atomic and hydrogen bombs must be prohibited, and the efforts of all countries to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes can be fully effective. Based on its consistent peace policy, the Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed banning the use of atomic weapons and advocated the establishment of strict international supervision. The Soviet Union's proposals have continuously aroused enthusiastic responses from the public in various countries. The recent declaration of the Asian-African Conference also put forward the proposal to eliminate nuclear weapons. Human conscience and reason resolutely demand this. No matter how the war groups plan, in the face of their own happiness and disasters, the people know how to use their own judgment and strength to make decisions and choices.
    It is the sacred duty of scientists to ensure that atomic energy and all scientific achievements are used not for war and destruction, but for peace and construction. The agreement signed by the Soviet Union and the five countries of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Germany has created broad prospects for our country to establish modern scientific experimental centers, research and develop the peaceful use of atomic energy. We are deeply convinced that the people and scientists of our country who have mastered their own destiny will definitely be able to struggle resolutely under the help of the Soviet Union to vigorously develop the peaceful use of atomic energy, accelerate the socialist construction of our country, and oppose the conspiracy of atomic war.

### 大力发展原子能的和平用途

　　大力发展原子能的和平用途
    为了在实际上促进和推广和平使用原子能，苏联同我国、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国和德意志民主共和国分别签订了关于帮助和平使用原子能的协定。这是根据今年一月间苏联部长会议的声明，由五国科学家和工程师组成的代表团在莫斯科会谈所得的结果。这是苏联的和平外交政策的光辉成就。这是苏联同我国和其他人民民主国家的伟大友谊的一个新的发展。
    根据协定的规定，在一九五五——一九五六年间，苏联要为中、波、捷、罗、德五国完成实验性原子堆和基本粒子加速器的设计工作，将工业生产的实验性原子堆和基本粒子加速器和必要的物质供应给这些国家，并无偿地向这些国家提供关于原子堆和粒子加速器的必要的科学技术资料。协定还规定，这些国家将得到苏联专家的指导和技术的帮助，苏联还担负这些国家在和平使用原子能方面所需专家的培养工作。由于这个协定，中、波、捷、罗、德五国将有可能在短期内建立它们自己的现代化的科学实验中心，开展自己的和平使用原子能研究工作。中国人民热烈欢迎这个协定。对于苏联在和平使用原子能方面给予我国的帮助，我们表示真诚的感谢。
    这个协定生动地体现了苏联一贯重视原子能和平用途的立场；它具体地说明苏联正在从一切方面采取措施来谋求和平的利益。由于苏联在国内广泛研究而且从各方面实施和平利用原子能，因此就有了基础来签订这样的协定，全面地帮助其他国家。一九五四年苏联就建立了世界第一个原子能电力站。它还正在建造一座约十万瓩电力的发电站。除此之外，在炼钢、冶金、农业、医学和地质研究等等方面，原子能的和平使用都有了很大的成绩。为了人类的利益，苏联从来不把这些经验保守和密藏起来，而愿意把这些成就贡献出来，为全人类造福。苏联准备在今年八月召开的讨论和平利用原子能的国际会议上提出原子能电力站的报告，就是一个最好的证明。现在，苏联不只是同中、波、捷、罗、德五国签订协定，帮助它们建立研究原子能的科学实验中心；而且它几次声明，还将扩大它所能够帮助的国家的范围。匈牙利和保加利亚就已经接到了这种建议，并且很快就要进行会谈来签订这种协定。可以想见，在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国的密切合作之下，和平利用原子能的成就，真正成为全人类最宝贵的财富之一，它决不是美国的原子狂人们所能够垄断的。
    我们早就指出，苏联和美国关于原子能问题的不同立场，分别代表着在这个问题上的两条尖锐对立的路线：以苏联的立场为代表的路线是全力发展和平使用原子能，坚决主张禁止原子武器，反对原子战争。以美国的立场为代表的路线是积极宣传和准备原子战争，极力阻挠和平使用原子能。这两条路线的尖锐对立现在已经更加明显地摆在人们的眼前了。
    为了急于把原子能用于屠杀人类，美国采取了许多实际行动来使原子武器合法化。美国政府已经公开宣布原子武器为常规军备，来挑起原子军备竞赛。它从各方面进行原子战争叫嚣，公然把原子战争威胁作为它的所谓“实力地位”政策的基础。为了欺骗人民，美国偶然也讲到和平利用原子能。它甚至还想用广告术，玩弄什么原子船来巡游世界，企图表明美国也想到原子能的和平用途。但是，事实很清楚，从一九四五年美国开始用原子弹屠杀了成千上万的日本人民以来，人们只看到它经常宣扬它有了多少原子弹和氢弹，坚决反对禁止原子武器，从来没有见到它把原子能用在任何和平事业方面。从这种事实看，就知道美国宣扬要同亚洲国家关于和平使用原子能进行所谓“合作”，其目的除了要想搜括亚洲国家的原子原料之外，不会有任何真正的和平意义。
    要使原子能真正用于和平目的，就必须停止将它使用于战争和屠杀的目的。必须禁止使用和生产原子弹和氢弹，各国为和平利用原子能而作的努力才能充分有效。苏联基于它一贯的和平政策，曾经多次提出禁止使用原子武器，并主张建立严格的国际监督。苏联的主张不断地引起了各国公众的热烈响应。最近亚非会议的宣言也提出了消除核子武器的主张。人类的良知和理性坚决要这样做。不管战争集团怎样打算，在自己的幸福和灾难面前，人民是知道用自己的判断和力量来作出决定的选择的。
    科学家的神圣职责，就是使原子能以及所有的科学成就不是用于战争和破坏，而是用于和平和建设。苏联同中、波、捷、罗、德五国签订的协定，使我国建立现代化科学实验中心、研究和发展和平使用原子能有了广阔的前途。我们深信，掌握了自己命运的我国人民和科学家们，将一定能够在苏联的帮助下，为大力发展和平使用原子能，加速我国的社会主义建设，反对原子战争阴谋而坚决奋斗。
