　　Tear Off the Two-Faced Mask
　　Shen Kai

　　In his "My Self-Criticism," Hu Feng tried his best to disguise himself as an innocent person, putting on a pitiful appearance like a child who accidentally broke a bowl. He attributed his anti-Party errors solely to "narrow practical viewpoints," "subjective and one-sided understanding," and therefore "treated the revolutionary nature and stance of the petty bourgeoisie as the revolutionary nature and stance of the working class, confusing the principled distinctions between them"... The entire "self-criticism" was to explain: Look, I only made some mistakes on "specific issues, and in general I am still loyal to the Party," "If it were not for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I would not have found a place to settle down in the past twenty years." Look, "When examining these contents, I felt even more deeply ashamed and pained." As if weeping bitterly, he said: Comrades! I have "deeply" repented.

　　Enough, Hu Feng!

　　Was it not you who called the Party "the officialdom" and slandered the Party's literary and artistic thought as "twenty years of mechanical materialism domination?" Was it not you who regarded the Party's literary and artistic writers and non-Party progressive literary and artistic writers as "enemies," slandering them as "local tyrants," "philistines," and "maggots?" Was it not you who threw "cluster grenades" at the people's cultural front and vowed never to "compromise" and to "coexist with the position" when the Party led the people of the whole country in a desperate battle against the Kuomintang reactionaries? Was it not you who "perfunctorily" dealt with the Party on the one hand, and "poured your heart and soul" into planning conspiracies to "meet the challenge" of the Party on the other? What is the similarity between this "hero" who is irreconcilable with the cause of the Party and the pitiful appearance of the "deeply" repentant in "My Self-Criticism"? Why don't you mention these things that relate to the essence of your soul?

　　Mr. Hu Feng! You are good at setting up "smokescreens" and talking about "tactics," which we have already seen in your letters to Shu Wu. We would like to tell you that merely taking off the guise of Marxism without tearing off your two-faced mask will not deceive anyone.

　　Tear off your two-faced mask!

　  剥下两面派的假面吧
    沈凯
    胡风在“我的自我批判”中，尽量地把自己装扮成无辜者，装出一副偶尔不慎打破一个碗的小孩儿似的可怜相。他把他反党的错误只归结为“狭隘的实践观点”啦，“主观片面的理解”啦，因而
  “把小资产阶级的革命性和立场当作了工人阶级的革命性和立场，混淆了它们中间的原则的区别”啦……整篇“自我批判”是在说明：你们看，我只是在“具体问题上犯了些错误，在总的方面我还是忠实于党的”，“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的”。你们看，“在检查到这些内容的时候，我更是深深地感到了惭愧和痛苦的”。好像是在痛哭流涕地说道：同志们！我已经“沉痛”地改悔了。
    算了吧，胡风！
    难道把党称作“官方”，把党的文艺思想诬蔑为“二十年的机械论的统治势力”的，不是你吗？难道把党的文艺作家和非党的进步的文艺作家当作
  “敌人”，诬蔑为“豪绅”、“市侩”、“蛆虫”的，不是你吗？难道在党领导全国人民同国民党反动派作殊死战的时候，向人民的文化阵地投“集束手榴弹”，并发出决不“妥协”“与阵地共存亡”的誓言的、不是你吗？难道一方面向党“敷衍”，一方面“呕心镂骨”地策划阴谋，向党“迎战”的，不是你吗？这种同党的事业势不两立的“英雄”，和在“我的自我批判”中的“沉痛”改悔者的可怜相，有什么相同之处呢？为什么这些涉及到你灵魂本质的东西，你绝口不提呢？
    胡风先生！你是善于布“疑阵”，讲“战术”的，这我们已经在你给舒芜的信上见识到了。我们愿意告诉你，仅仅脱下马克思主义的伪装，不剥下你的两面派假面，还是骗不过人的。
    剥下你的两面派假面吧！
