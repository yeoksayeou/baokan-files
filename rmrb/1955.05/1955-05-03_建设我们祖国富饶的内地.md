　　Building Our Motherland's Rich Interior
　　Qiao Yuzhou
    The vast interior of our motherland, with its abundant material resources and favorable geographical conditions, is an extremely ideal region for large-scale economic construction.

    Everyone knows that the interior of our country is a region extremely rich in various mineral deposits. In the northwest of the motherland, from both sides of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, all the way to the Hexi Corridor north of the Qilian Mountains, and then past the Liupan Mountains to northern Shaanxi, oil fields stretch for thousands of miles. Currently, all of China's natural petroleum is produced here. The Yumen Oil Mine has become China's largest petroleum base. According to earlier estimates, Shanxi Province's coal reserves account for more than 47 percent of the country's total. Among them, Datong has a particularly large amount of coal reserves; even if 40 to 50 million tons of coal are mined annually, it would take hundreds of years to exhaust them. Abundant iron ore deposits have been discovered around Daye in Hubei and Baotou in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the state is currently preparing to build new and large-scale steel bases in these areas. The southwest and northwest regions also have more than 70 percent of the country's water resources, which can be used as a powerful source of energy. The interior also contains large reserves of non-ferrous metals and non-metallic minerals. After several years of large-scale exploration, copper mines in the northwest have been confirmed to be the best type of ore deposit in the world, with extremely rich reserves. It is said that a foreigner who obtained some asbestos only 108 centimeters long considered it a "rare treasure" and was called the "Asbestos King." However, asbestos of better quality and up to 120 centimeters long is produced in Xikang, China.

    The increasingly growing agriculture and animal husbandry in the interior provide us with large quantities of commercial grain and meat, and also provide favorable conditions for the development of light industry in the interior. The wheat production in Henan, Shanxi, Hebei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces accounts for 50 percent of the country's total wheat production. Sichuan, the "Land of Abundance," produces more grain than any other province in the country. In the past, when people talked about Xinjiang, they easily associated it with barren Gobi deserts, but in fact, Xinjiang is a rich place. The large and sweet watermelons and grapes are famous throughout the country, and the yield of cotton per unit area is several times higher than the highest yields in other regions.

    As early as two thousand years ago, our ancestors began irrigation projects on the Hetao Plain along the Yellow River, and large-scale irrigation in the Wei River valley began even earlier. The verses in the Book of Songs, "Zhouyuan wuwu" and "Shuji yiyi," both describe the fertility of the fields and the flourishing of crops in this area in the early years.

    As for animal husbandry in the interior, it is even more developed than in other regions. In particular, in the Northwest Region, the number of sheep accounts for 54 percent of the country's total, goats account for more than a quarter, and wool production accounts for more than half of the country's total. Other livestock such as cattle, horses, mules, and camels also account for a considerable proportion of the country's total. Every year, animal husbandry in the Northwest Region can produce more than 8 million hides of various kinds, more than 5 million sausage casings, more than 400,000 catties of bristles, and more than 1 million catties of camel hair. These precious animal products are important raw materials for the wool textile industry, the leather industry, and the food industry, and are also one of China's main export commodities.

    In old China, the rich resources of the motherland's interior were not valued, let alone developed. Only after the victory of the people's revolution did a new page appear in the history of these regions. The power of the people is changing the face of these regions. As a cartoon depicts: young students, while studying geography, are adding railways and cities to the map and constantly saying, "It's changed again!" Yes, in these places, new factories and mines are being built, sandstorms will be conquered, and rivers will be utilized to benefit the people...

    In recent years, the textile industry in the interior, especially in the cotton-producing areas of Hebei, Henan, and Shaanxi, has developed significantly. Due to the construction of new power plants and the expansion of existing ones, cities such as Taiyuan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Urumqi, and Chongqing, which previously lacked electricity, have now received a more adequate supply of power; towns such as Xilinhot in Inner Mongolia and Bayanhot in Gansu, located on the grasslands, have also begun to shine brightly. Following in the footsteps of geologists, in these places, huge coal mines are being mined, and the number of oil derricks is increasing day by day...

    Railways and highways are also being extended. On early maps, there was not even a single railway on China's vast western territory. Many places did not even have a single highway. The Kuomintang government marked a Sichuan-Kangding-Qinghai highway with a red line on the map, but that line never saw a single car pass. The people of Sichuan struggled for forty years to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and this wish was not realized until after the liberation of the country. Since 1950, most of the more than 4,000 kilometers of newly built railway trunk lines in the country have been in the southwest and northwest regions. The railways from Chongqing to Chengdu and from Tianshui to Lanzhou were completed in 1952; the railway from Baoji to Chengdu has fully started construction and will be open to traffic in 1957. The railway from Lanzhou via Urumqi to Almaty in the Soviet Union can also be laid to Zhangye in the Hexi Corridor this year. The Jining-Erenhot railway connecting China and Mongolia has also been completed. The planned Baotou-Lanzhou railway will also be a key construction project this year.

    Another exciting construction project in the various construction projects in the interior of the motherland is the comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River's water resources. The Yellow River, which has been the most serious disaster for thousands of years, will be tamed. According to the plan formulated based on the results of investigations and research conducted since 1950, in the future, many hydroelectric hubs will appear in the Yellow River basin. At these hydroelectric hubs, China's largest hydroelectric power stations will be built, the cities and villages on both banks will be illuminated brightly, and the machines in many factories and mines will be powered by electricity. The Yellow River will also become a clear blue stream, bringing green grasslands to the still barren loess areas on both banks. The farmland in the Yellow River basin will be well irrigated, and strong crops will grow year after year. At that time, the shipping industry on the Yellow River will also be greatly developed: 3,000-ton ships can go up the river directly to Zhengzhou, and 500-ton ships can also sail to Lanzhou. The "Green Great Wall," which is being built in the Northwest Region along the 3,000-mile-long Great Wall from Yulin in northern Shaanxi to Jiuquan in Gansu, will also grow up. In this way, the invasion of sandstorms can be fundamentally prevented, millions of acres of farmland will be protected, and many farmlands destroyed by wind and sand will be restored.

    The vast wasteland in the interior of the motherland will also be developed in large quantities. According to the plan recently formulated by the agricultural department, the state will survey 111.5 million mu of wasteland in fourteen provinces and regions in the next three years. In a few years, huge state-owned mechanized farms will be established in Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Gansu, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Yunnan and other places.

    The rich interior and beautiful prospects of the motherland are calling for young builders. Not long ago, at the State-owned Friendship Farm, I saw a comrade named Liu Ying. Many young students who have read the article "Visit to Tongbei Farm" in junior high school textbooks will know that she was a sixteen-year-old female student from Beijing No. 3 Girls' Middle School who went to Tongbei Farm five years ago to participate in the farm's construction. In 1953, she returned to Beijing due to illness. Her kind-hearted mother advised her: there is no need to go to that far-off frontier, it would be better to drive a tractor at a state-owned farm nearby. But she did not listen to her mother's advice. The great construction on the grassland attracted her. She returned to the farm again. Now, on the grounds of the Friendship Farm, people have seen her again working with everyone on new construction projects. What is it that has attracted her alone to the great construction cause of the motherland? When Kou Yonghua, a female exploration team member who was carrying out petroleum exploration in the Jiuquan Basin, wrote to her friend Zhu Xiuqin in Nanjing about the construction life in the Jiuquan Basin, didn't Zhu Xiuqin, this nineteen-year-old girl who grew up in the city, travel more than 3,000 kilometers to the Jiuquan Basin to participate in the geological exploration work there?

    At the Friendship Farm, I also saw hundreds of enthusiastic letters from young people, who sent deep care and encouragement to the people there, and expressed their hope that one day they could also participate in the construction of the interior. A medical worker in Shanghai wrote to the farm, telling them that, according to his understanding, the local people of the farm have a habit of eating mole crickets, and eating uncooked mole crickets can easily cause lung fluke disease. He urged the leaders of the farm that it is best not to let the comrades eat mole crickets, or be sure to cook them thoroughly before eating them. The members of the Third Squadron of the Young Pioneers of Beijing No. 9 Middle School, who are studying, sent a small package of fine seeds that they had specially collected for the farm. It is precisely this kind of concern for the people who are building the interior that allows the petroleum exploration team members far away in the Qaidam Basin to eat Hunan bacon, Guangdong sausage, Shanghai smoked fish, Dalian canned food, Dunhuang mooncakes and fruits. People regard the construction of the interior as their own personal undertaking, and every achievement of the people in the interior will arouse people's infinite encouragement and joy...

    The Chinese people's love for the construction of the motherland is understandable. In the past, some young friends often talked with regret about not being able to catch up with the great People's Liberation War and contribute their own strength to it. And now, in the cause of building our great motherland's interior, China's youth have every opportunity, and will certainly take on this cause with the same heroic spirit, dedicating their youth to the great construction cause of the motherland!

　　建设我们祖国富饶的内地
　　乔雨舟
    有丰富物质资源和良好地理条件的祖国广大的内地，是进行大规模经济建设的极为理想的地区。
    谁都知道，我国内地是各种矿藏极为丰富的地区。在祖国的西北，从新疆的天山两侧，一直到祁连山北面的河西走廊，再过六盘山到陕北，油田绵延千里。目前，我国的天然石油都出产自这里。玉门油矿已成为我国最大的石油基地。据早前的估计，山西省煤的储藏量，占全国的百分之四十七以上。其中大同一地煤的储量特别多，以年采煤四、五千万吨计，几百年也开采不完。在湖北大冶周围和内蒙古自治区的包头，已发现大量的铁矿，国家正在这些地区进行着新的巨大的钢铁基地的筹建工作。在西南、西北两区也有占全国的百分之七十以上的可以作为强大动力资源的水利。内地也储藏着大量有色金属和非金属矿藏。西北的铜矿，经过几年来大规模的勘探，已被证实是世界上最好类型的矿床，而且储量极为丰富。据说，外国有一个人弄到了一些只有一百零八公分长的石棉，就认为是“稀世之珍”并被人喻为“石棉大王”。而比这种石棉质地更好、长达一百二十公分的石棉就出产于我国的西康。
    内地日益发展壮大的农业和畜牧业，给我们提供了大量的商品粮食和肉类食品，也给在内地发展轻工业提供了便利的条件。河南、山西、河北、四川、陕西、甘肃等省小麦的产量，占全国小麦总产量的百分之五十。“天府之国”的四川，粮食产量比全国任何一个省份都多。过去，当人们一谈到新疆时，很容易地就和荒凉的戈壁沙漠连在一起，其实新疆是一个富饶的地方。那儿又大又甜的西瓜和葡萄闻名全国，棉花的单位面积产量，比其它地区最高产量还高数倍。
    远在两千年前，我们的祖先就在黄河上的河套平原开始了灌溉事业，而渭河流域的大规模灌溉还要早些。诗经“周原膴膴”“黍稷翼翼”都是形容早年这一带田地肥沃庄稼茂盛的诗句。
    至于内地的畜牧业，更比其他地区发达。特别是西北区，绵羊头数占全国的百分之五十四，山羊占四分之一以上，羊毛产量占全国的一半以上。其他牲畜如牛、马、骡、骆驼等，在全国也都占有相当比重。每年，西北区的畜牧业可以出产各种皮子八百多万张，肠衣五百多万根、猪鬃四十多万斤、驼毛一百多万斤。这些珍贵的畜产品，是毛纺织工业、皮革工业和食品工业的重要原料，也是我国主要出口物资之一。
    在旧中国，祖国内地丰富的资源没有被重视，更说不上进行开发了。只有在人民革命胜利之后，这些地区的历史才出现了新的一页。人民的力量正在改变这些地区的面貌。正如一张漫画所表现的那样：年青的学生们在学习地理课时，一方面在地图上添画着铁路和城市，一方面又不住嘴的说：“又变了！”是的，在这些地方，一座座新的工厂和矿山正在建设，大风沙将被征服，河流将被利用起来为人民造福……。
    几年来内地特别是河北、河南、陕西等产棉区的纺织工业，有了显著的发展。由于新建和扩建旧有的电厂，在以前缺少电力的太原、西安、兰州、乌鲁木齐、重庆等城市中已得到了较充足的电力；位于草原上的内蒙古锡林浩特和甘肃巴音浩特等城镇，也已开始大放光明了。随着地质人员们的脚迹，在这些地方，巨大的煤矿正在被开采，石油的井架也一天天多了起来……。
    铁路和公路也在伸延着。在早年的地图上，我国辽阔的西部版图上，连一条铁路也没有。很多地方连一条公路也没有。国民党政府在地图上用红线标示着一条川康青公路，可是那根线上从来没有通过汽车。四川人民为修建一条成渝铁路斗争了四十年，直到全国解放以后，这个愿望才实现了。从一九五○年以来全国新建的四千多公里铁路干线，其中绝大部分都在西南和西北地区。从重庆到成都和从天水到兰州的铁路都已在一九五二年建成了；从宝鸡到成都的铁路已全面开工，将在一九五七年通车。由兰州经乌鲁木齐到苏联阿拉木图的铁路，今年也可以铺轨到河西走廊的张掖。连接中蒙两国的集宁到二连的铁路也已建成。计划中修筑的包头到兰州的铁路，今年也要重点进行施工。
    祖国内地各项建设中的另一件振奋人心的建设工程，就是综合利用黄河水利的工作。数千年来为患最烈的黄河将被治服。根据一九五○年以来所进行的调查研究结果而拟订的计划，在未来的日子里，将有许多水力枢纽出现在黄河流域。在这些水力枢纽处，将建设中国最大的水力发电站，两岸的城市和村庄将被照耀得雪亮，许多工厂和矿山里的机器将用电力开动起来。黄河也将变成一条清澈的碧流，把绿色的草原带给现在还是一片光秃秃的两岸的黄土地带。黄河流域的农田将得到很好的灌溉，年年生长出茁壮的庄稼来。那时候，黄河的航运事业也将大大发展：三千吨的轮船可以沿河而上直达郑州，五百吨的轮船也可以驶到兰州。正在西北地区从陕北榆林到甘肃酒泉长达三千里的长城沿线上营造的“绿色长城”，也将成长起来。这样，沙患的内侵便可根本制止，数百万亩农田将受到保护，许多被风沙毁壤的农田将恢复起来。
    祖国内地的广大荒地也将大量开发，根据不久前农业部门制定的计划，在今后三年内，国家将在十四个省区内勘测荒地一亿一千一百五十万亩。几年后，在黑龙江、新疆、甘肃、内蒙古自治区和云南等地，巨大的国营机械农场将被建立起来。
    祖国的富饶的内地和美丽的远景正在召唤着青年建设者。不久前，在国营友谊农场里，我曾看到了一个叫刘瑛的女同志。许多在初中课本上读过
  “通北农场访问记”一文的青年学生们都会知道，她就是五年前由北京第三女子中学到通北农场去参加农场建设的一个十六岁的女学生。一九五三年，她曾因病回到了北京。好心肠的妈妈劝告她：不必到那老远的边疆去了，在近处的国营农场开拖拉机好了。可是她没有听妈妈的劝告。草原上的伟大建设吸引着她。她又回到农场里去了。现在，在友谊农场的场地上，人们又看到了她和大家一起在从事着新的建设工作。为祖国的伟大建设事业而吸引的何止她一人呢？当在酒泉盆地上进行石油勘探的女勘探队员寇永华把酒泉盆地的建设生活写信告诉了她在南京的朋友朱秀琴以后，朱秀琴，这个十九岁的在城市里长大的姑娘，不也是旅行了三千多公里到酒泉盆地参加了那里的地质勘探工作吗？
    在友谊农场里，我还看到数百封青年们热情的来信，他们寄给那里的人们深切的关怀和鼓励，并表示希望着有一天他们自己也能去参加内地的建设。一个在上海的医务工作者写信告诉农场：据他了解农场当地人民有一种吃蝼蛄的习惯，吃了不熟的蝼蛄，容易染肺吸血虫病。他叮嘱农场的领导上，最好不让同志们吃蝼蛄，或者一定煮熟再吃。正在学习的北京第九中学少先队第三中队的队员们给农场寄去了一小包他们自己特为农场搜集的优良的种子。也正是人们对建设内地的人们的这种关心，使远在柴达木盆地的石油探勘队员们能吃上湖南的腊肉、广东的香肠、上海的薰鱼、大连的罐头，敦煌的月饼和水果。人们把内地的建设当成了自己的切身事业，而内地人们的每一成就都又会引起人们的无限鼓舞和欢欣……。
    我国人民这种热爱祖国建设的心情是可以了解的。过去，一些青年朋友们常常以遗憾的心情，谈论着自己没有能赶上参加伟大的人民解放战争，并在其中贡献出自己的一份力量。而现在，在建设我们伟大祖国的内地的事业中，我国的青年们，完全有机会，也一定会以同样的英雄气概把这一事业担当起来，把自己的青春献给伟大祖国的建设事业！
