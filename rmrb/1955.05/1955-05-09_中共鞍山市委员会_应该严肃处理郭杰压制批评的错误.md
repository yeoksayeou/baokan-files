The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
Should Seriously Handle Guo Jie's Mistake of Suppressing Criticism

Editor:
After reading the People's Daily editorial on March 4, "The Evil Consequences of Pride and Complacency," and the handling of the serious suppression of criticism by Wang Zisheng and others at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant by the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, we were encouraged to fight. We also want to expose to the Party newspaper the bad behavior of Guo Jie, the deputy manager and Party branch secretary of the Anshan Timber Company, who is arrogant, complacent, and suppresses criticism.

In November 1954, Jiang Shuheng, a cadre of the Anshan Timber Company, wrote an article criticizing Guo Jie for suppressing criticism, violating financial regulations, and arbitrarily using working capital, intending to submit it to the Anshan Workers' Life Newspaper. However, before the manuscript was mailed, it fell into Guo Jie's hands. Immediately, Guo Jie aggressively summoned Jiang Shuheng to question him about whether he wrote the manuscript. Seeing his bad expression, Jiang Shuheng dared not admit it. Two or three days later, Guo Jie summoned Jiang Shuheng again to report on his work situation in the past three months and to "solicit" Jiang's opinions on the organization. Before Jiang Shuheng could answer these questions, Guo Jie rebuked him in a series of loud voices: "You can admit in front of others that you wrote this material, why are you so dishonest in front of me?" "You are a backward fellow, destroying Party unity, you should be removed from your position and made a salesperson; if you don't change, you will be sent to the People's Court." "Are you writing this material to fix me, Guo Jie? Even if I, Guo Jie, go to court, you, Jiang, won't be able to become the manager of the Anshan Timber Company!" "Jiang Shuheng, I'm telling you, if you want to work, you have to work hard, if you don't want to work, then forget it. The Anshan Municipal People's Committee has the People's Supervision Committee, and Anshan also has the Workers' Life Newspaper, do whatever you want." "No matter where you take this issue, it will have to be resolved by me, the Party branch secretary. What exactly can you do!" Guo Jie's shouting and scolding shocked the staff working in the front and back buildings and the residents around.

The Anshan Workers' Life Newspaper exposed this matter on November 17. Not only did Guo Jie not review his mistakes based on the newspaper's criticism, but he was furious. He picked up the phone and complained to Su Dongfa, the Party branch secretary of the Commercial Bureau, saying that the criticism in the newspaper was an insult to him and demanded that he be sent to the Central Committee; otherwise, he would rather be expelled from the Party and go home. From then on, he held even more resentment towards Jiang Shuheng. As soon as he saw Jiang Shuheng, he glared at him and often found fault with Jiang.

Guo Jie not only cannot accept public criticism in the newspaper, but it is also impossible to offer him criticism within the company. He often preemptively questions others about their shortcomings; or labels those who offer opinions as "backward fellows." His style is very improper. He always suppresses and hates cadres who offer opinions; he is biased and believes in those who flatter him. He only reports achievements and not shortcomings to superiors. He is amiable to his colleagues in person, but complains behind their backs. Within the Party, Guo Jie does not follow the principle of collective leadership, but acts arbitrarily on his own. If the other four Party branch committee members request a meeting to resolve a certain issue, he disagrees, and the meeting cannot be held.

Why does Guo Jie dislike criticism and like flattery so much? Mainly because he has a serious bourgeois, arrogant, complacent, and individualistic ideology. He often says: I have been a Party member for so long, whether I study or not, I still work the same way. I have been working the same way for so many years without studying. He never studies the policies and instructions of his superiors, and thinks he knows everything (in fact, he doesn't know anything, such as in every current affairs test, he only gets about ten points), and rarely asks for instructions or reports on his work to the higher leading organs.

Guo Jie's serious mistakes of arrogance, complacency, and suppression of criticism are known to the Party and administrative leaders of the Commercial Bureau, but they have adopted a bureaucratic and liberal attitude towards Guo Jie, which has fueled the development of Guo Jie's mistakes.

### 中共鞍山市委员会　应该严肃处理郭杰压制批评的错误

　　中共鞍山市委员会
　　应该严肃处理郭杰压制批评的错误编辑同志：
    看了三月四日人民日报社论“骄傲自满的恶果”和中共太原市委处理太原钢铁厂王自生等严重压制批评的事件后，鼓舞了我们斗争的勇气，我们也要向党报揭发鞍山木材公司副经理兼党支部书记郭杰骄傲自满、压制批评的恶劣行为。
    一九五四年十一月份，鞍山木材公司干部姜树珩写了一篇批评郭杰压制批评，违反财政制度，擅自动用流动资金的稿子，准备投到鞍山工人生活报去。谁知稿件还未寄出就已落到郭杰的手中了，顿时，郭杰气势汹汹地把姜树珩叫去质问稿件是不是他写的，姜树珩看见他颜色不好，不敢承认。过了两三天，郭杰又把姜树珩找去让他汇报三个月来的工作情况，并“征求”姜对组织上有哪些意见。姜树珩还没有来得及答复这些问题，郭杰就一连串地厉声斥责：“你在别人面前能承认这份材料是你写的，当我面为什么就这样不老实呢？”“你这个落后家伙，破坏党的团结，应该撤你的职，叫你当营业员去；再不改，就送你到人民法院。”“你写材料不是整我郭杰吗？就是我郭杰上法院，你姓姜的也当不上鞍山木材公司的经理呀！”“姜树珩，我告诉你，愿意工作就得好好工作，不愿工作就拉倒，市人民委员会有人民监察委员会，鞍山市还有工人生活报社，随你的便。”“这个问题你弄到哪里还得转回我党支部书记这儿解决，你到底能怎样！”郭杰的吵闹谩骂声，使得正在前后楼工作的工作人员和左右居民都大吃一惊。
    鞍山工人生活报于十一月十七日揭发了这件事情，郭杰不但没有根据报纸的批评来检讨自己的错误，反而大发雷霆，抓起电话就向中共商业局总支书记苏东发牢骚，说报纸上的批评对他是侮辱，要求把他送到中央去，否则，宁可开除党籍回家。从此以后，他对姜树珩就更加怀恨，他一看见姜树珩，就怒目横视，并且还经常找姜的岔子。
    郭杰不但不能接受报纸上的公开批评，就是在公司内部向他提出批评也是不行的。他常用先发制人的办法质问别人有没有缺点；或者给提意见的人扣上个“落后家伙”的帽子。他的作风很不正派。他对待提意见的干部，一向是打击、仇视；对于奉承他的人，则是偏听偏信。对上级是只报成绩，不报缺点。对同级干部是当面买好，背后发牢骚。在党内郭杰也不是按照集体领导的原则来办事，而是一人独断专行，如果其他四个党支部委员要求开会解决某一个问题，他不同意，会就开不成。
    郭杰为什么这样不喜欢批评光喜欢奉承呢？主要是他有着严重的资产阶级骄傲自满的个人主义思想。他常常说：党龄都这样长了，学不学还不是一样工作，我这些年来没学习也一样工作。他对上级的方针、政策、指示从来不研究，自以为什么都懂
  （实际上什么也不懂，如每次时事测验，他都是十分左右），也很少向上级领导机关请示、报告工作。
    郭杰骄傲自满、压制批评的严重错误，商业局的党和行政领导同志都是知道的，他们却采取了官僚主义和自由主义的态度对待郭杰，这就助长了郭杰错误的发展。　　鞍山木材公司　晓明　白皑
