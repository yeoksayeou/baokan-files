Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant
　　Achieves Results in Conserving Scrap Metal

To the Editor:
　　Our Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant has achieved preliminary results in conserving metal materials. From April to the first half of May, we have extracted more than 3,200 kilograms of copper slag and more than 1,100 kilograms of copper blocks from the ash of the copper smelting plant. Smelting this scrap copper into pure copper for the copper workshop to cast locomotive and passenger car copper parts can save the country more than 8,000 yuan. In the work area of the riveting workshop that manufactures galvanized iron sheets, more than 3,100 kilograms of zinc slag have also been collected. Re-smelting this zinc slag can also save more than 2,000 yuan. In addition, some aluminum sheet scraps have also been picked out of the scrap iron pile, which can be reused.
　　The work of recycling scrap metal is the responsibility of the Material Utilization Workshop. Because the workers attach great importance to this work, the scope of recycling is expanding day by day. In late March, Li Ruiyou, a young worker from the Carpentry Workshop, suggested extracting copper slag from the furnace ash. After successful experimentation, the leadership immediately transferred Li Ruiyou to the Material Utilization Workshop to be responsible for copper extraction, and transferred some workers from other workshops to participate in copper extraction. In the past, some fine zinc powder splashed out when galvanizing iron sheets and fell on the ground, and no one paid attention to it; now the workers have also begun to recycle it. The workers of the Material Utilization Workshop are also preparing to collect hardware ash from the locomotive workshop where "axle瓦 [wǎ -tile]" hardware is cast, and to thoroughly recycle scrap metal in various workshops.
　　The achievements in metal conservation have encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers to collect scrap metal. Someone said: Our factory is really full of gold everywhere, and everyone must collect all kinds of metals buried and unnoticed and put them into national construction.

　　青岛四方机车车辆制造工厂
　  节约废金属获得成绩编辑同志：
    我们青岛四方机车车辆制造工厂金属材料节约工作获得初步成绩。从四月份到五月上半月，已从化铜厂的炉灰中淘出了三千二百多公斤铜渣和一千一百多公斤的铜块。用这些废铜炼出纯铜供给铜场浇铸机车、客车的铜配件，可以为国家节约八千多元。在压铆车间制造镀锌铁皮的作业场里，也拣出了三千一百多公斤的锌渣。把这些锌渣重新回炉炼锌，也能节约二千多元。此外在废铁堆里也拣出了一部分铝板的碎屑，可以重新利用。
    废旧金属的回收工作，是由利材车间职工负责的。由于职工们都很重视这项工作，回收的范围正在日益扩大。三月下旬制材车间青工李瑞友建议从炉灰中淘取铜渣，经试验成功后，领导方面立即调李瑞友到利材车间去担任淘铜工作，并从其他车间调出一些工人参加淘铜。过去在铁皮上镀锌时溅出一些锌的细末，落在地上，就没有人注意；现在职工们也已经开始回收。利材车间职工还准备再从机车车间铸五金“轴瓦”的地方收集五金灰和在各车间彻底回收废金属。
    节约金属工作获得的成绩，鼓舞了职工们收集废金属的热情。有人说：咱们厂里真是遍地黄金，大家一定要把埋藏着无人注意的各种金属收集起来，投入国家建设中去。李鸿起
