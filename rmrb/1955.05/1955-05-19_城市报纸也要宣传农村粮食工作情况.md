　　City Newspapers Should Also Publicize Rural Grain Work
    The work of rectifying the unified purchase and sale of grain currently underway in rural areas is not only of concern to the broad masses of farmers, but also to urban residents, especially the working class. The workers in our country have a close relationship with the farmers; many workers' families are farmers, and they cannot but care about the situation in the countryside, and cannot but care about all the major measures of the Party and the government in the countryside. City newspapers and workers' newspapers have a responsibility to inform readers about the situation and problems of grain work in rural areas, to publicize and explain to readers the Party and government's principles and policies on grain work, and to reflect the achievements of rectifying the unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas. In carrying out such publicity, special attention should be paid to linking it with the ideological reality of the working masses. In this way, the newspaper will not only be able to eliminate some workers' misunderstandings about the rural grain supply work, but also be able to mobilize the working masses to help implement the Party's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas by writing letters to their families, etc., and play the due role of the working class in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.
    The Shanghai Liberation Daily is doing just that. Starting from May 7th, this newspaper has continuously published three articles in the column "Talking about the Countryside with Workers," using the actual examples that Shanghai workers come into contact with, analyzing the real reasons for the artificial tension in rural grain supply, answering some workers' questions about whether there is a general shortage of grain in rural areas, explaining the benefits of implementing the "three fix" policy for grain to the country, to farmers, and to workers, and pointing out how workers should correctly treat family members who have come to Shanghai in the midst of artificial tension, or family members who write letters to "complain." The Liberation Daily not only cited rich factual material in the above-mentioned articles, but also published some reports reflecting the real situation in rural areas. For example, a report published on May 6th, based on what Zhao Defeng, a staff member of the Shanghai Medical College Model Manufacturing Factory, saw and heard in his hometown, explained that many people calling for a shortage of grain is not a real shortage of grain. The "Two Family Letters" published on May 9th reflected how the state guarantees the grain supply to farmers who are genuinely short of grain. These reports are convincing. In addition, the Liberation Daily also published articles commending some employees for how, after investigation and study and learning the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, they used the advanced thinking of the working class to persuade their family members to return to their hometown to produce, or wrote letters home to educate their family members to settle down and produce. The Liberation Daily's publicity on this issue has achieved good results in raising the working masses' understanding of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and promoting their active assistance to the government in rectifying the unified sale of grain in rural areas.
    The practice of the Liberation Daily not only shows that newspapers should be good at publicizing the Party and government's policies in light of the ideological conditions of the masses; it also shows that city newspapers and workers' newspapers should be good at grasping the major issues in rural work and farmers' lives, and conducting ideological education on the worker-peasant alliance to the working masses in a purposeful and systematic manner. All city newspapers and workers' newspapers should learn this method of publicizing the idea of the worker-peasant alliance.　(Zhong Huai)

### 城市报纸也要宣传农村粮食工作情况

　　城市报纸也要宣传农村粮食工作情况
    目前正在农村中进行的粮食统销的整顿工作，不仅为广大农民所关心，而且也为城市居民特别是工人群众所关心。我国工人同农民有着骨肉的关系，许多工人的家属就是农民，他们是不能不关心农村的情况，不能不关心党和政府在农村中的一切重大措施的。城市报纸和工人报纸都有责任将农村粮食工作的情况和问题告诉读者，向读者宣传解释党和政府关于粮食工作的方针、政策，并反映整顿农村粮食统销工作的成就。在进行这种宣传时，尤其要注意联系工人群众的思想实际。这样，报纸就不只是能够消除部分工人对农村粮食供应工作的误解，而且能够动员工人群众用给家属写信等方式，帮助贯彻党在农村的粮食统购统销政策，发挥工人阶级在巩固工农联盟方面的应有作用。
    上海解放日报正是这样做的。这个报纸从五月七日起，在“和工人谈农村”的专栏里连续发表了三篇文章，运用上海工人所接触到的实际事例，分析了不少农村粮食供应的人为紧张情况的真实原因，回答了有些工人对农村里是不是普遍缺粮的疑问，解释了实行粮食“三定”政策对国家、对农民、对工人的好处，指出了工人应当怎样正确地对待在人为的紧张空气中跑到上海来的家属，或写信来“诉苦”的家属。解放日报不仅在上述这些文章中引用了丰富的事实材料，而且发表了一些反映农村真实情况的报道。像五月六日发表的一篇报道，就以国营上海医学院模型制造厂工作人员赵德风在家乡的耳闻目睹，说明了许多人叫喊缺粮并不是真正缺粮。五月九日发表的“两封家信”，则反映了国家如何保证对真正缺粮农民的粮食供应。这些报道是有说服力的。此外，解放日报还发表文章，表扬一些职工在经过调查研究和学习了粮食统购统销的政策后，怎样以工人阶级的先进思想，说服自己的家属回乡生产，或者写信回家，教育自己的家属安心生产。解放日报关于这个问题的宣传，已经收到提高工人群众对粮食统购统销政策的认识、推动他们积极协助政府整顿农村粮食统销工作的良好效果。
    解放日报的做法不仅说明了报纸应当善于针对群众的思想状况来宣传党和政府的政策；而且说明了，城市报纸和工人报纸要善于抓住农村工作和农民生活中的重大问题，向工人群众有目的地、有系统地进行工农联盟的思想教育。所有城市报纸和工人报纸都应当学会这种宣传工农联盟思想的方法。　（钟怀）
