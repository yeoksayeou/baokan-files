　　Wheat-Producing Area in the Gobi Desert
　　Chen Jun
　　In 1954, farmers in Anxi County, Gansu Province, sold 11.28 million jin of surplus grain to the state, an increase of 1.48 million jin compared to 1953; moreover, more than 80% of this grain was wheat. If we look at this figure in isolation, it may not seem worth mentioning. However, what is noteworthy is that this happened in Anxi County. Anxi County is located in the Gobi Desert; the county extends 200 kilometers from east to west and 160 kilometers from north to south; the entire county has only over 5,200 peasant households, a rural population of 27,000, and a cultivated area of just over 140,000 mu. Before liberation, this county suffered from famine every year. After liberation, in 1950 and 1951, it still relied on state relief; but by 1952, this situation began to turn around. By 1954, the entire county was able to sell more than 10 million jin of surplus grain, with an average of more than 2,100 jin of grain sold per peasant household. Isn't this change a tremendous change?!

　　Anxi County is located outside Jiayuguan, 1,000 kilometers from Lanzhou. In the old society, people described the area outside Jiayuguan as a barren and terrifying region, and some even used the following tragic words to describe the despair of those leaving the pass: "Once you leave Jiayuguan, your eyes are never dry from tears. Looking ahead, it's the Gobi Desert; looking back, it's the gate to hell. You can never return to Jiayuguan!" The natural environment of Anxi was exaggerated to be even more terrible. People called Anxi a "one-gale-a-year" area, meaning that the area was windy all year round. After liberation, some individual reporters exaggerated that the wind there could blow away large pumpkins, live sheep, and even donkeys. In the early days of liberation, some ideologically unhealthy Communist Party members felt that being sent there to work was a form of punishment. Indeed, for those who have never been to that area, some questions may seem difficult to understand: how can people survive there if it's windy all year round and doesn't even rain all year round?

　　After liberation, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was overthrown. The Communist Party led the peasants in carrying out land reform and launching production movements. Comrade Chang Kun, Secretary of the Anxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China, spent a year investigating and studying the production situation, land, and water sources of the county's peasants. He grasped the natural conditions of Anxi County and, together with the masses, used favorable conditions to overcome various difficulties, thus making great achievements in agricultural production and construction. In the struggle against nature, it was confirmed that Anxi County has vast fertile land and is suitable for large-scale mechanized farming, making it a good reclamation area for the country; it was also confirmed that the poverty of Anxi County in the past was caused by the reactionary Kuomintang; most of the terrible stories about Anxi County were unfounded and unreliable legends.

　　Anxi County is indeed windy, but it is not "one-gale-a-year," nor is it windy every day, and there is no truth to the claim that it blows away large pumpkins, live sheep, or live donkeys. In addition to frequent winds in spring and winter, there is relatively little wind between May and October. In late April, the reporter passed through Anxi County twice in four days and stayed in the city for a day, without encountering any wind.

　　The climate here is a continental climate, with large temperature variations. However, the frost-free period here is between 150 and 170 days, which is suitable for crop growth.

　　It does rain very little here, but growing crops here does not rely on rainfall, but on irrigation. The snowmelt and spring water flowing from the Qilian Mountains form large and small rivers that can be used to irrigate fields. Here, there are crisscrossing large and small canals, and in general, fields only need to be watered twice a year to ensure a good harvest. In the old society, landlords and despots occupied the canals, and many peasants' fields could not be watered; and the crude and simple canals caused a large amount of mountain water to be lost, which could not be fully utilized. How could many peasants not flee famine every year? After initial repairs in recent years, the existing canals are already sufficient to supply water for the existing cultivated land.

　　There is indeed sand here, even sand mountains; but there is also fertile land and millions of mu of arable wasteland. In the past, sand was a threat to good fields, and shifting sand had swallowed up many good fields. Now, under the leadership of the Party, the people have adopted various effective methods to prevent and control sand, restricting the movement of sand and restoring some of the good fields. At the same time, sand is not only detrimental. Due to the stickiness and alkalinity of the soil here, according to the experience of the peasants, adding just over twenty cartloads of sand to one mu of land can turn it into fertile land.

　　Before liberation, Sigung Village in Anxi County suffered from famine every year, and by the time of liberation, the residents of this village had almost all fled. In the past five years, the people who had fled have slowly returned, and now it has recovered to more than 120 households. In 1954, the entire village sold 360,000 jin of surplus grain.

　　Before liberation, a middle peasant in Tougong Village had 40 mu of land and five laborers, but could only harvest six or seven dan of grain each year, which was not enough to live on and had to rely on borrowing high-interest loans to survive. As a result, two of his laborers had to work as long-term laborers for the landlord who lent money. In addition, a young man was forced to flee to the outside world to avoid being drafted into the army. This was the fate that the old society gave to middle peasants. After liberation, this household still has 40 mu of land, but the yield has increased year by year, and last year it harvested more than 20 dan of grain.

　　With the development of agricultural production, the people's living standards have also improved. In 1954, the purchasing power of the people in the county had increased to 2 million yuan. In 1953, the average peasant in the county bought 3.5 zhang of cloth. How could the people not be encouraged by the new life! They warmly support the Communist Party and the People's Government. In the most recent promotion of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds, it was estimated that 31,000 yuan would be sold, but in less than 20 days, the people bought 42,000 yuan and paid in cash.

　　Agricultural production in the Anxi area has great prospects for development. In 1955, the cultivated area of Anxi County will be expanded to 148,500 mu, the yield per unit area of wheat will be increased to 282 jin, and the trial planting of cotton has begun as a priority. If, in the future, under the overall planning of the state, a large reservoir can be built in Anxi to save the 60% to 70% of the Qilian Mountain water that is currently lost, and the irrigated area can be expanded in a planned manner, then Anxi County can accommodate a large number of immigrants, operate large-scale state-owned farms, and reclaim millions of mu of wasteland. This is an area that is so worthy of our active construction.

　　戈壁滩里的产麦区
　　陈浚
    一九五四年，甘肃省安西县农民卖给国家余粮一千一百二十八万斤，比一九五三年增加了一百四十八万斤；而且这些粮食百分之八十以上是麦子。如果孤立地来看这个数字，也许不值得一提。但是值得注意的，是这件事情出在安西县。安西县是在戈壁滩中的一个县份；县境东西长二百公里，南北宽一百六十公里；全县只有五千二百多户农民，两万七千多农业人口，耕地面积才十四万亩多一些。解放以前，这个县年年闹灾荒。解放以后，一九五○年和一九五一年，还要靠国家救济；可是到了一九五二年，就开始扭转了这种情况。到一九五四年，全县竟能卖出一千多万斤余粮，每户农民平均卖粮两千一百多斤。这个变化，难道还不是一个翻天覆地的大变化吗？！
    安西县在嘉峪关外，距离兰州一千公里。在旧社会里，人们把嘉峪关外的地区，说成是荒芜可怕的地区，曾有人用过下面凄惨的字句，来形容出关的人的绝望心情：“出了嘉峪关，两眼泪不干。往前看，戈壁滩；往后看，鬼门关。永远回不了嘉峪关！”安西的自然环境被夸张得更加可怕。人们把安西称为“一年一场风”的地区，就是说这个地区整年刮大风。解放以后，曾有个别记者渲染那里的风能刮起大南瓜，活羊子，甚至还有大毛驴。解放初期，有些思想不健康的共产党员，认为派他到那里去工作，是一种处分。的确，对于没有去过那个地区的人来说，有些问题似乎是不容易理解的：成年刮大风，甚至还成年不下雨，人怎能在那里生存呢？
    解放以后，国民党反动派的统治被推翻了。共产党领导农民进行了土地改革，开展了生产运动。中共安西县委书记常昆同志，曾花了一年的工夫，调查和研究了全县农民的生产情况，土地和水源等等的情况。他掌握了安西县的自然条件，并同群众一起，利用有利的条件，克服种种困难，因而在农业生产建设方面作出了很大的成绩。在同自然的斗争中，证实了安西县有着广大肥沃的土地，并且宜于大规模机械耕种，是国家的良好垦区；也证实了过去安西县地瘠民贫，是国民党反动派造成的；种种关于安西县的可怕的说法，大部分都是无稽的不可靠的传说。
    安西县的确多风，但是，并不是“一年一场风”，天天刮风，更没有刮起大南瓜、活羊、活驴的事实。那里除了春季和冬季经常刮风之外，在五月到十月之间，风是比较少的。四月下旬，记者在四天中，两次经过安西县境，并在城里逗留了一天，都没有碰上过风。
    这里的气候是大陆性气候，冷热变化很大。但是，这里的无霜期，在一百五十天到一百七十天之间，宜于作物生长。
    这里的确很少下雨，但是，这里种庄稼却不靠天下雨，而是靠灌溉。祁连山上源源不绝地流下来的雪水和泉水汇成的大小河流，都可以利用来灌溉田地。这里，有纵横交错的大小渠道，一般的田地，一年只要浇上两次水，就可以保收。在旧社会里，地主恶霸霸占了渠道，许多农民的田地，浇不上水；而粗糙简单的渠道，又使山水大量流失，不能充分利用。这样，许多农民怎能不年年逃荒呢？几年来，经过初步整修后，现有渠道已经足够供应现有耕地的用水了。
    这里，的确有沙，甚至有成座的沙山；但是，还有肥沃的土地，成百万亩可开垦的荒地。沙，过去是良田的威胁，流沙也曾吞没了不少良田。现在，人民在党的领导下，采用了多种防沙压沙的有效办法，限制了沙的流动，恢复了部分良田。同时，沙并不只是有弊无利的。由于这里土质的粘性和碱性，根据农民的经验，开一亩地，只要上二十几车沙，就能变成良田。
    安西县的四工村，解放以前，年年闹灾荒，到刚刚解放那年，这个村的住户已经几乎跑光了。五年来，跑出去的人又慢慢都回来了，现在已经恢复到一百二十多户人家了。一九五四年，全村卖出余粮三十六万斤。
    头工村一户中农，解放前，有地四十亩，五个劳动力，每年只能打粮食六、七石，不够生活，只得靠借高利贷来维持。这样，他家就有两个劳动力，不得不到放债的地主家去当长工。另外，还有一个青年，为了逃避抓壮丁，也被迫逃到外面去了。这就是旧社会里所给予中农的命运。解放以后，这户还是四十亩地，可是产量已逐年提高，去年已打到二十多石粮食。
    随着农业生产的发展，人民的生活也提高了。一九五四年，全县人民的购买力已提高到二百万元。一九五三年，全县农民每人平均买布三丈五尺。人民怎么能不为新的生活所鼓舞呢！他们热烈拥护共产党和人民政府。在最近一次推销一九五五年国家经济建设公债中，预计推销三万一千元，结果不到二十天，人民买了四万二千元，并且交齐了现款。
    安西地区的农业生产是有很大的发展前途的。一九五五年，安西县的耕地面积将扩大到十四万八千五百亩，单位面积产量，麦子要提高到二百八十二斤，并且开始了重点试种棉花。如果，将来在国家整体规划之下，能够在安西修起大型水库，把现在流失的百分之六十到七十的祁连山的山水都保存起来，有计划地扩大灌溉面积，那么，在安西县可以容纳大量移民，经营大型国营农场，开垦出成百万亩的荒地。这是一个多么值得我们去积极建设的地区。
