　　Promoting Interior Scaffolding
　　Huo Xueguang
    There are two types of scaffolding used in construction: one is erected outside the building, called exterior scaffolding. This is the type of scaffolding that has always been used in China's construction industry. The other is a tool-type scaffolding erected inside the building, called interior scaffolding. Interior scaffolding is an advanced construction method that has been widely adopted in the Soviet Union for nearly twenty years.
    Interior scaffolding has many advantages: First, its turnover rate is high, which can save a lot of wood. Second, the structure is simple and easy to erect, which can save a large number of scaffolders. Third, the structure is stable and the operation is safe. Fourth, the area is wide, which is convenient for transporting materials. Fifth, it is easy to implement mechanized construction.
    In the past year, the promotion of interior scaffolding in Beijing, Northeast China, Xi'an and other regions has fully proved the superiority of interior scaffolding. For example, the first work area of the Beijing Fourth Construction Engineering Company used bamboo to make bamboo stool-type interior scaffolding, which reduced the scaffolding material cost by 82.2 percent, and the labor productivity exceeded the 1954 national quota by an average of 35 to 40 percent, with the highest exceeding 70 percent. Construction workers in Xi'an City used local hardwood small round wood to make ladder-type scaffolding, which is simple in form, cheap in cost, and easy to load and unload. Some construction units have also adopted the Skaus interior scaffolding, which is particularly suitable for small factories and warehouses.
    Since interior scaffolding has these advantages, why hasn't it been promoted nationwide in the past? This is mainly due to the influence of certain conservative ideas. For example, some technical cadres believe that standing inside to build the outer skin of clear water wall cannot guarantee the quality and the work efficiency is not high, fearing that it will affect the completion of the task. Some foremen and old workers are afraid that young apprentices' skills are not high and lack experience, so they cannot reach the quota and complete the task. Some people used to working on exterior scaffolding, and after changing the method, they were afraid that they would not reach the quota and affect their income. In April this year, the Technical Department of the Ministry of Construction Engineering held a symposium on interior scaffolding. At the meeting, these incorrect ideas were criticized. Everyone agreed that the implementation of interior scaffolding is an important method to ensure that construction achieves "good, economical, fast, and safe," and it should be vigorously and comprehensively promoted.

### 推广里脚手架

　　推广里脚手架
　　霍学光
    建筑施工时使用的脚手架有两种：一种是搭设在建筑物外面的，叫做外脚手架。这是我国建筑界一直使用的一种脚手架。另外一种是搭设在建筑物里面的工具式脚手架，叫做里脚手架。里脚手架是苏联近二十年来普遍采用的先进施工方法。
    里脚手架的优点很多：第一，它的周转率大，能节约大量的木材。第二，结构简单，架设方便，可以节约大批的架子工。第三，结构稳固，操作安全。第四，面积宽阔，便于运输材料。第五，便于实行机械化施工。
    一年来，在北京、东北、西安等地区推广里脚手架过程中，充分证明了里脚手架的优越性。例如北京市第四建筑工程公司一工区用竹料做成竹凳式里脚手架，降低了脚手架料费百分之八十二·二，劳动生产率平均超过一九五四年国家定额百分之三十五到四十，最多的超过百分之七十。西安市建筑工人利用当地的硬质小圆木制成梯式脚手架，形式简单，造价便宜，便于装卸。还有的施工单位采用了斯考式里脚手架，对于小型厂和仓库特别适用。
    里脚手架既然有这些好处，为什么过去没有在全国范围内推广呢？这主要是受某些保守思想的影响。如有的技术干部认为站在里面砌外皮清水墙，不能保证质量，工效不高，怕影响任务的完成。有的工长和老工人怕青年徒工手艺不高，缺乏经验，达不到定额，完不成任务。也有些人过去习惯了在外脚手架上做活，改变方法后，怕达不到定额，影响收入。今年四月，建筑工程部技术司召开了里脚手架座谈会，在会上批判了这些不正确的思想，大家一致认为推行里脚手架是保证施工达到“好、省、快、安全”的重要方法，要大力地全面地推广。（附图片）
