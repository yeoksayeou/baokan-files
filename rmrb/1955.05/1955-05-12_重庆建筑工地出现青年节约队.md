Youth Thrift Teams Appear on Chongqing Construction Sites

　　Twenty youth amateur thrift teams have emerged on various construction sites in Chongqing, playing a significant role in the anti-waste struggle. According to statistics from only four construction sites, including the Southwest Textile Administration Bureau Engineering Company, the materials collected by the youth amateur thrift teams are worth more than 11,430 yuan. At the Shizitan Hydropower Station construction site, the thrift team of which Lin Qirong and other youths are members, often collects discarded materials on the ground and repairs unusable tools for use in construction. They have now repaired three flatbed carts and six leaky air ducts. In addition to emphasizing thrift themselves, the youth amateur thrift team at the No. 4 Construction Site of the Chongqing Engineering Office of the Ministry of Construction mobilized more than 400 workers to collect discarded materials on the construction site, setting off a wave of opposition to waste and promotion of thrift. The thrift team at the No. 206 Construction Site of the Chongqing No. 2 Construction Engineering Company also records the items picked up each day, as well as the time and place of collection, and promptly hands them over to the construction personnel, who use broadcasts to publicize them, promoting thrift among everyone.

　　重庆建筑工地出现青年节约队
    重庆市各建筑工地出现了二十个青年业余节约队，他们在反浪费斗争中发挥了很大的作用。仅据西南纺织管理局工程公司等四个工地的统计，青年业余节约队从工地上搜集的材料就值一万一千四百三十多元。狮子滩水电站工地的林其荣等青年所在的节约队经常把遗弃在地上的材料收集起来，并把拣到的不能用的工具修理好，供建设中使用。现在，他们已经修好三辆平车和六根漏风管。建筑工程部重庆工程处第四工地青年业余节约队除自己重视节约外，还动员四百多名工人到工地上收集被遗弃的材料，在工地上掀起了反对浪费、厉行节约的热潮。重庆市第二建筑工程公司二○六工地节约队还把每天拣到的东西和拣东西的时间、地点记下来，及时交给施工员，由他们通过广播进行宣传，推动大家厉行节约。（本报驻重庆记者）
