　　The Friendship of Youth

    Han Chinese young workers in various production and construction departments in Lhasa teach scientific production knowledge and technology to Tibetan young workers. Caitan Zhuma, a 23-year-old Tibetan female fitter at the Tie Mu Factory in the Tibet Military Region, said of Wan Boliang, a Han Chinese young fitter: "Wan Boliang is as good as my own brother!" They worked face-to-face in the same factory building for three years. When Caitan Zhuma first arrived at the factory, she knew nothing. Wan Boliang would come in early and leave late, teaching her how to operate the manual lathe. Each time he taught her, he would demonstrate it to her. Now, Caitan Zhuma has learned to manufacture more than a dozen kinds of precision parts, increasing her production from 70 bridge-building screws a day to more than 420 a day. She has also been promoted to be the leader of the Tibetan female workers' team.
    Han Chinese young teachers in the social education class of the Cadre School of the Tibet Military Region often introduce the geography, history, and economic construction of the motherland to Tibetan students. Young Communist Party members Yan Jia-yi and Gu Yun-juan also go to the homes of Tibetan students on Sundays to give supplementary lessons, or talk to their Tibetan friends about the heroic and exemplary deeds of young people of all ethnic groups in the motherland in production, construction and defense of the motherland. The students also tell them Tibetan folk tales and introduce them to Tibetan customs. Some female students regard them as their own relatives, and even consult them about their marriage problems. Once, the mother of Tibetan female student Suona Zhuga fell ill, and Yan Jia-yi went to visit her, caring for the sick old woman as if she were her own mother. Suona Zhuga said gratefully: "You are my own sister!"
    Tibetan youths from the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association and members of the Tibet Military Region Art Troupe of the People's Liberation Army have established close friendships. Tibetan youths teach Tibetan drama, songs, and dances to members of the art troupe, while members of the art troupe teach them to play the violin and accordion, and help them rehearse entertainment programs. At social gatherings, they dance together and sing together. Many members of the art troupe have good Tibetan friends. Tibetan girl Gezhen was a girl who rarely went out, but since becoming acquainted with Liu Jingling, a young member of the art troupe, she has developed a strong interest in all new things. She and Liu Jingling teach each other their languages. Last year, she joined the Tibetan Song and Dance Troupe to go to Beijing, and before leaving, she invited Liu Jingling to her home to talk. In a recent letter to her mother from the mainland, Gezhen also asked her mother to greet her friend and to tell Liu Jingling that she must learn her skills well and come back to build a new Tibet. Many members of the art troupe have also made friends with rural youths during their tours and study in the countryside. Dawa Zhima and Cairong Zhuoma, two Tibetan girls from Zhebu Village on the opposite bank of the Lhasa River who are good at singing and dancing, often come to the art troupe to visit their friends. Tibetan youths from the rural areas near Qamdo and Yadong also often send messages to greet the members of the art troupe. Whenever these rural youths meet the members of the art troupe, they immediately start talking cordially. When parting, the Tibetan youths hold their hands tightly and say: "Don't forget me!"

　　青春的友谊
　　新华社记者　格来
    拉萨各生产、建设部门的汉族青年工人，把科学的生产知识和技术教给藏族青年工人。西藏军区铁木工厂二十三岁的藏族女钳工彩丹珠玛提起汉族青年钳工万柏梁时说：“万柏梁像我的亲哥哥一样好！”他们在一个厂房里面对面工作了三年。彩丹珠玛刚到工厂时什么都不会。万柏梁就早上班晚下班，教她掌握手摇车床。每教一次，他就作个样子给她看。现在彩丹珠玛已学会了制造十多种精细的零件，从开始每天生产七十个架桥用的螺丝钉，提高到每天生产四百二十多个。并被提升作藏族女工班的班长。
    西藏军区干部学校社会教育班的汉族青年教员经常向藏族学员介绍祖国地理、历史情况和祖国的经济建设。年轻的共产党员阎家懿和顾云娟，星期日还到藏族学员家里去补课，或是和她们的藏族朋友谈祖国各族青年在生产建设和保卫祖国中的英雄模范事迹。学员们也给她们讲述藏族的民间故事，向她们介绍藏族的风俗习惯。有的女学员把她们当成自己的亲人，把自己的婚姻问题都来找她们商量。有一次藏族女学员索娜珠噶的母亲病了，阎家懿就去看望，像关怀自己的妈妈一样的关怀生病的老人。索娜珠噶感激地说：“你就是我的亲姐姐！”
    拉萨市爱国青年文化联谊会的藏族青年和人民解放军西藏军区文工团团员建立了亲密的友谊。藏族青年把西藏的戏剧、歌舞教给文工团团员，文工团团员也教他们演奏提琴、手风琴，帮助他们排练文娱节目。在联欢晚会上，他们互相结伴跳舞，联合演唱。许多文工团员都有他们的藏族好朋友。藏族姑娘格珍原是个不大出门的女孩子，自从和文工团的青年团员刘静菱结织以后，对一切新事物都有了浓厚的兴趣。她和刘静菱互相教话。去年，她参加了西藏歌舞团到北京去，临出发前把刘静菱请到自己家里谈心。格珍最近从内地寄给母亲的信里，还叫妈妈问候她的朋友，并要妈妈告诉刘静菱，她一定要学好本领回来建设新西藏。许多文工团员在巡回演出和下乡学习时，还和农村青年们结成了朋友。拉萨河对岸哲布村能歌善舞的藏族姑娘达娃芝玛和才蓉卓玛常到文工团来看望她们的朋友。昌都附近农村和亚东的藏族青年也常常捎来口信问候文工团员们。每当这些农村青年和文工团员碰到一起的时候，他们马上就亲热地谈起来。临别时，藏族青年紧紧握着他们的手说：“不要忘记我哟！”
