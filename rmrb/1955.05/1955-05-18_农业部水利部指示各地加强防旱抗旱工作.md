Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China jointly issued instructions on the 14th regarding vigorously developing farmland irrigation and further strengthening drought prevention and combat.

The instructions stated that this spring, most parts of the country, except for the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, have generally experienced dry weather. Many provinces in the south have had prolonged periods with no or little rain, affecting the growth of minor spring crops and the planting of early rice. Although Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Guizhou provinces have received successive rainfall since May, and the drought situation has gradually eased, the drought situation in some areas of provinces such as Shandong and Shanxi continues to develop.

At present, most areas in the south have entered the rice transplanting season, and the north is in the period of wheat jointing and the sowing of cotton and early autumn crops. Further improving drought prevention and combat work to ensure timely sowing, transplanting, and irrigation water is a crucial key to completing this year's agricultural production increase. Therefore, all regions must educate cadres and the masses of farmers to overcome the negative sentiment of relying on the sky for rain and make early preparations for drought prevention and combat.

The instructions require that all regions vigorously develop farmland irrigation, and unfinished projects should be completed as soon as possible. In areas in the north suitable for wells, leadership over waterwheels and wells should be strengthened, and the current slow development should be quickly corrected. All regions should strengthen the leadership of existing irrigation facilities, improve irrigation management, promote day and night rotational irrigation, and coordinate with advanced agricultural techniques to implement unified water distribution and shallow irrigation, furrow irrigation, and ditch irrigation methods to save water and expand the irrigated area as much as possible. Areas currently experiencing drought should summarize and promote the masses' experience in drought prevention and combat, adopt various temporary measures, and make full use of all possible water sources to strive to complete the planned planting area. Drought prevention and combat work in disaster-stricken areas last year should be combined with disaster relief to solve the specific difficulties of the masses in their lives and production, and various measures should be taken to replant and supplement seedlings.

The instructions point out that drought prevention and combat should be combined with flood prevention and drainage. All irrigation projects should be strictly managed to ensure both irrigation water and safety during the flood season. Attention should be paid to promoting ditch-ridge fields and terraced fields in sloping and low-lying areas to disperse water storage and prevent both drought and flood.

　　农业部水利部指示各地加强防旱抗旱工作
    新华社十六日讯　中华人民共和国农业部和水利部在十四日联合发出关于大力开展农田水利进一步加强防旱抗旱工作的指示。
    指示说，今春全国各地除长江中、下游外，一般气候干旱，南方许多省份长期无雨或少雨，影响小春作物生长及早稻播种插秧。虽然五月份以来，广东、广西、福建和贵州四省陆续降雨，旱象逐渐缓和，但山东、山西等省部分地区旱象仍在继续发展。
    目前南方大部地区已到插秧季节，北方正是小麦拔节、棉花和早秋作物播种用水时期，进一步做好防旱抗旱工作，保证及时播种、插秧和灌溉用水是完成本年农业增产的重要关键。因此，各地必须教育干部及农民群众克服靠天等雨的消极情绪，及早作好防旱抗旱准备工作。
    指示要求各地必须大力开展农田水利，对未完成工程应抓紧时间及早完成。北方宜井地区应加强对水车、水井工作的领导，迅速纠正目前发展迟缓的情况。各地应加强领导现有灌溉设施，改善灌溉管理，提倡日夜轮灌，配合先进的农业技术，实行统一配水及浅灌、畦灌和沟灌等方法，以节省用水，尽可能扩大灌溉面积。目前已发生旱象的地区，要总结推广群众的防旱抗旱经验，采取各式各样的临时措施，尽量利用一切可能利用的水源，以争取完成计划播种面积。去年受灾地区的防旱抗旱工作，应结合救灾解决群众生活与生产中的具体困难，并采用各种措施进行抢种补种。
    指示指出，防旱抗旱应与防洪防涝相结合，各项灌溉工程应严加管理，既要保证灌溉用水，又要保证汛期安全，坡地洼地应注意推广沟洫畦田，分散蓄水，兼防旱涝。
