　　The First Day
　　——A Dispatch from the State-Run Friendship Farm
　　By Our Correspondent Li Wen
    On May 2nd, after the groundbreaking ceremony, I rode a motorcycle to the field station with Gao Zuolai, a tractor driver from the Fifth Sub-Farm, Tenth Production Team, who had attended the ceremony. We arrived at the station at dusk.
    The station consisted of a green camper van, two tents, and three outhouses, surrounded by a seemingly endless wilderness. The area had been cleared by burning a few days prior, and the ashes of the wild grass had laid a layer of dark grey carpet upon the prairie, and the newly plowed virgin land was emitting a moist, inviting smell of earth. This reminded me of a scene described by a tractor driver named Liu Huangao in his poem:
	
		Wildfire burns off ten thousand years of wild grass,
		The black, oily soil smiles at the sun.
    Those who haven't come to the prairie to participate in land reclamation find it hard to grasp the bold emotions revealed in these lines, it is a joyful feeling of pride when one sees the wilderness turn into fertile land in one's own hands.
    The station was quiet, no one was home, only the roar of tractors could be heard all around.
    Getting off the motorcycle, Gao Zuolai went into the kitchen and took three sesame cakes, and then went into the tent to get a cotton coat to put on. As he walked, he told me, "Comrade Yao, please wait a moment, Captain Yan and the comrades on the day shift will be back soon, and I have to go on the night shift!" "You worked all night yesterday, didn't you rest during the day today? Don't you need to sleep?" I asked worriedly. He pointed and laughed, "Listen (he was referring to the tractors that were operating), our march into the wilderness has already begun, every moment is precious. If I were to sleep, I wouldn't be able to anyway!" As he spoke, he went to the field like a gust of wind.
    I went into the camper van alone, which served as the production team's headquarters. It was a green house on four iron wheels that could be moved at any time. It was about the size of three rooms, with fourteen beds, as well as desks, cabinets for supplies and documents, and a self-contained battery for electric lighting at night. This vehicle even had a bathroom with boiler equipment, where the tractor drivers could take a shower after a hard day's work. Seeing all this, it naturally occurred to me that the Soviet people were being so thoughtful for us!
    At that moment, a man of medium height walked into the camper van, his face covered in black dirt, which made his large eyes appear particularly bright. This was Yan Shiliang, the captain of the Tenth Production Team, who had just returned from the field.
    After I explained my purpose, he said very simply, "Good! Let's talk now, even if it's just for a few minutes, the tractor drivers will eat, and then I have to get busy!" He went on to tell me about the situation in his team on the eve of the land reclamation and on the first day of it:
    "For a long time, the young fellows have been brimming with energy. They say, 'From the first day I set foot in the Great Northern Wilderness, I've been looking forward to this day coming soon. This time we must reclaim land with all our might.'
      "Today, as soon as it was light, the tractor drivers got up. Some went to check the machines, some fetched water, and some carried stakes and ran to the fields to mark lines (a straight line must be marked out before plowing). By six o'clock, all of our tractors were on time to their designated sections, plowing the first furrow.
    "On the first day of land reclamation, we received strong assistance from Soviet experts. The Soviet experts inspected the plowing of each vehicle in turn, and found that there were more 'standing rafts' in the ground. He immediately looked for the reason, and found that the extension plate behind the plowshare was not installed properly. He suggested modifying the extension plate, and in less than half an hour, each vehicle was corrected, and the quality of plowing was improved in time.
    "Today, of the five vehicles we dispatched for plowing, three exceeded the quota. Hao Huanwen, the driver of the Det-54 Type 79 tractor, plowed well and in high quantities. He completed 140 percent of the quota, and fuel consumption was 22 percent lower than the quota.
    "Speaking of Hao Huanwen, he hasn't been driving tractors for very long. In the past, he worked at the State-Run Shuangqiao Farm, and was only promoted from farm worker to tractor assistant last spring. Although he had only participated in autumn plowing work, he improved his professional skills very quickly because he studied hard. When he came to the Friendship Farm, he was appointed as a shift driver. He also enthusiastically helped the farm implement workers learn technology, and repeatedly encouraged them: 'There must be no carelessness in the quality of land reclamation, the quality is largely dependent on the farm implement workers.' When reclaiming land, he paid attention to maintaining close contact with the farm implement workers, stipulated contact signals, and would jump out of the car at any time to check the quality of plowing, and tell the farm implement workers what kind of soil and terrain required them to master the depth of plowing."
    His words were interrupted by the production deputy team leader, Lao Deng, who had just returned from the field. They were studying how to hold brief meetings using the gaps in work, which was proceeding day and night, so that everyone could promptly study the problems in their work and exchange experiences.
    Shortly after they had discussed it, the tractor drivers began to walk into the camper van one after another. A small symposium was held as planned. At the meeting, everyone talked about their feelings on the first day of "attack," about the difficulties of the work, and some also talked about their work experience. After the meeting, Captain Yan urged everyone again and again like an older brother: "Comrades, go to sleep quickly! Only by resting well can you do a good job, tomorrow's work is waiting for you!"
    The camper van gradually quieted down, and I asked Captain Yan to continue the conversation that had been interrupted earlier. Old Yan was about to open his mouth when another person walked in from outside. This person was around twenty years old, wearing a tattered military cap and a faded cotton coat. He said slowly, "Captain Yan, didn't you want to talk to me about something?"
    Old Yan didn't immediately open his mouth, he glanced at me embarrassedly, and from this look, I felt like he was saying: "Look, I have something else to do!"
      "We want to transfer you from the farm worker group and ask you to manage a section of the meals. This is a very important job, it is related to the health of everyone in the team, and it is related to whether we can successfully complete the land reclamation task. Naturally, we are starting from scratch in the wilderness, the conditions in all aspects are not good, and there will be many difficulties." Captain Yan began his words.
      "I haven't done this kind of work before, I'm afraid I can't do it!" the young man said hesitantly.
      "All skills are developed from doing them. I haven't been to a production team leader training class, and I haven't worked on a farm, but I'm still learning how to do the work of a captain."
    The young man in the faded cotton coat smiled slightly and silently accepted the new job.
    Captain Yan continued:
      "Tractor drivers and farm implement workers are working in the wilderness, enduring wind and sun, all day long, and the most urgent thing at the moment is to solve the drinking water problem. Yesterday we delivered water by cart, and when the cart reached the ground, the water was almost spilled..."
    "Then, it would be good if we delivered water with water tanks!" the young man blurted out.
    "It's good, but where do we get the water tanks? If we make a budget and ask the higher authorities to do it, it will take more than ten days to go back and forth, which is not urgent. We have to think of a way ourselves. I saw empty pickle jars in the kitchen, this thing has a big belly, holds a lot of water, but the mouth is very small, and it is not easy to spill water, we might as well search for a few; we can also go to the kitchen to find some beer bottles, if there are dozens of them, each tractor driver can bring a bottle of water when they go to work, which can also solve a lot of problems!"
    "Okay! Just let me do it! I have no experience, I'll consult with the cooks more!" The young man walked away happily.
    The night was deep, but the prairie did not become silent. The roar of the tractors working the night shift in each production team resounded throughout the prairie, and looking out from the window of the camper van, silver, brilliant lights shone in the near and far reaches of the prairie. This sound and this light aroused people's excitement. I couldn't help but think of a scene from a month ago:
    That was when the tractor test run (combined with harrowing) was being carried out. On the evening of April 6, Comrade Jing of the Writers Association and I were both in the residence of Comrade Kruikov, a Soviet expert and agricultural chief engineer consultant. We and the experts talked like old friends, talking about the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, about the present and future of the farm, and also about the large-scale land reclamation undertaking that the Soviet people were carrying out. Comrade Kruikov said: "Although our languages are different, our cause is common. The people of our two countries are so close. At this moment in my hometown, in our Siberia, it is just like here, on the eve of land reclamation. How vibrant our life is here, and how wonderful the prairie night is! The vast prairie is like a clear blue sea, and everywhere here and there are tractor lights flashing like silver flowers..." He became more and more excited as he spoke, and pulled us and several Soviet experts who lived in the same room to go outside together. At this time, dark clouds rose up, covering the moon, and a thick fog enveloped the prairie. The tractor lights shone silver light through the fog layer, and the prairie was immersed in the roar of the tractors—a moving performance.
    Comrade Kruikov said with great emotion: "Comrades, please listen, this sounds a bit like artillery fire, but it is not the artillery fire of the Japanese imperialists attacking Northeast China twenty years ago; this is also an attack, this is the Soviet people helping their brothers—the Chinese people—launch an attack on the wilderness, on nature. It can be said to be a great attack!"
    The cold wind ruffled the old expert's hair, we couldn't see his excited and agitated face clearly, but we felt the heartfelt love and brotherly affection of the Soviet people for the Chinese people. This feeling surged in my heart once again on the first day of land reclamation at the Friendship Farm.

　　第一天
　　——国营友谊农场通讯
　　本报记者　力文
    五月二日，开荒典礼结束后，我随着参加典礼的五分场代表、第十生产队的拖拉机手高作来，乘摩托车去田间作业站。我们到达作业站的时候，已是黄昏了。
    这个作业站由一辆绿色的宿营车，两个帐篷，三座茅房组成，四周是一眼看不见边的原野。几天前，这里已进行过烧荒，野草的灰烬给草原铺上了一层深灰色的地毡，新犁起的处女地，正散发湿润的诱人的泥土气味。这使我想起一个名叫刘换高的拖拉机手在自己的诗句里所写的场面：
        野火烧尽万年野草，
        黑油油的土地望着太阳微笑。
    没有来草原参加开荒的人，是很难体会到这诗句中流露的豪放的情感的，这是人们看到荒原在自己手中变成肥田而感到自豪的一种喜悦心情。
    作业站静悄悄地，没有人在家，只听到四周传来拖拉机的轰鸣。
    走下摩托车，高作来到伙房里拿了三张油饼，又到帐篷里取了一件棉袄披在身上，一面走一面告诉我：“老姚同志，你稍等一下，颜队长和日班的同志们就要回来了，我就要去值夜班了！”“你昨天干了一整夜，今天白天没有休息，不需要睡会觉吗？”我耽心地问。他用手一指，笑道：“你听（他指的是正在开动的拖拉机）我们向荒地的进军已经开始了，一时一刻都是宝贵的。这样让我睡，我也睡不着！”他一面说着，一阵风似地下地去了。
    我独自一人走进宿营车，生产队的指挥部设在这里。这是一幢带有四个铁轮的绿色房屋，可随时流动，有三间房子那样大，设有十四个床铺，还设有办公桌、放零用品和文件的立柜、自带电瓶，夜间还有电灯照明。这辆车上带有锅炉设备的盥洗室，紧张劳动一天的拖拉机手还可以在这里来一个淋浴呢。看到这些，很自然地想到，苏联人民为我们打算得实在周到啊！
    这时，一个中等身材的人走进宿营车，他满脸黑土，两只大眼睛显得分外亮。这就是第十生产队队长颜世良同志，他刚从田间归来。
    我向他说清来意后，他很干脆地说：“好！现在我们就谈谈吧，能谈几分钟，就是几分钟，拖拉机手们吃过饭，我又要忙活起来！”他接着向我介绍他们队在开荒前夕和开荒第一天的情况：
    “好久以来，小伙子们都鼓着一股劲。他们说：‘从我动身到北大荒的第一天起，就盼着这一天快些来到。这次开荒定要痛痛快快地干一场。’
      “今天，刚亮天，拖拉机手都起身了，有的去检查机器，有的取水，有的扛起标杆，跑向地里划线（耕地前要划出一条笔直的线）。六点多钟，我们的各台拖拉机都按时开到指定地段，犁起第一道犁沟。
    “开荒的第一天，我们就得到了苏联专家的有力帮助。苏联专家挨次检查了每台机车翻地的情况，发现地里的“立筏”比较多，他立即寻找原因，原来是犁铧后面的延长板安装得不适当，他提出改装延长板的建议，不到半个小时，每台机车都纠正过来了，耕地质量及时得到了改进。
    “今天，我们出动的五台翻耕地的机车中，有三个机车突破了定额。德特五四式七十九号机车驾驶员郝焕文耕的地质量好，数量也高，他完成了定额的百分之一百四十，耗油量比定额降低了百分之二十二。
    “说起郝焕文，他开拖拉机的时间并不长。过去他在国营双桥农场工作，去年春天才由农工提升为拖拉机助手。他虽然只参加过秋翻地工作，但是因为他认真钻研，业务能力提高得很快。来到友谊农场，他就被任命为换班驾驶员。他还热情帮助农具手学习技术，一再鼓励他们：‘开荒的质量不能有丝毫马虎，质量的好坏，农具手起着重要的作用。’开荒时，他注意同农具手密切联系，规定了联系信号，还随时跳下车来，检查耕地质量，告诉农具手什么样的土壤、地形，该怎样掌握下犁的深度。”
    他的话被刚从地里回来的生产副队长老邓打断了，他们在研究在工作昼夜不停的情况下，如何利用空隙召开简短的会，以便大家及时研究工作中的问题和交流经验。
    在他们商量过不多一会儿，拖拉机手们便陆续走进宿营车来。一个小型座谈会照计划召开了。会上每个人都谈到了“进攻”第一天的感受，谈到了工作的困难，也有人谈了些工作经验。散会了，颜队长像一个老大哥似的一再督促大家：“同志们，赶快睡觉去吧！休息好，才能干好工作，明天的工作还等着你们呢？”
    宿营车里渐渐安静下来，我请颜队长把先前被打断了的谈话继续下去。老颜正要开口的时候。可是这时从门外又走进一人，这人二十岁上下，带一顶破军帽，披着件褪了色的棉袄。他慢声慢语地说：“颜队长，你不是要给我谈些什么吗？”
    老颜没立即开口，他不好意思地望了我一眼，从这眼光里，我觉得他好像在说：“你看，我又有事了！”
      “我们想把你从农工组调出来，请你管理一段伙食。这是一个很重要的工作，他关系着全队每个人的健康，关系着我们能不能胜利完成开荒任务。自然，我们是在荒地上起家，各方面条件都不好，困难也会很多。”颜队长开始了他的话。
      “我没有干过这样工作，怕干不了！”小伙子犹豫地说。
      “什么本领也都是从做中锻炼出来的。我也没进过生产队长训练班，没在农场工作过，我还不是学着做队长的工作。”
    这个穿褪色棉袄的小伙子微微一笑，默默地接受了新的工作。
    颜队长接着讲下去：
      “拖拉机手、农具手们在荒地上，风吹日晒，一整天一整天地干着活，目前最迫切的是解决饮水问题。昨天我们用大车送水，车到地头，水差不多也泼光了……”
    “那末，我们用水箱送水，就好了！”小伙子脱口而出地说。
    “好是好！我们哪里去弄水箱呢？造预算，让上级去做，往返也要十几天，不顶急用。我们要自己想办法。我曾看见伙房里有空着的咸菜坛子，这东西，肚子大，装水多，口却很小，不易向外泼水，不妨搜索几个；还可以到伙房找些啤酒瓶，如果能有几十个，每个拖拉机手上班时，带上一瓶水，也能解决不少问题啊！”
    “好吧！就让我干了吧！我没经验，多找炊事员商量！”这个小伙子高高兴兴地走了。
    夜深了，草原并没有寂静下来。各个生产队的夜班作业的拖拉机的轰鸣声响彻草原，从宿营车的窗户向外望去，在草原的近处远处都闪耀着银色的灿烂的灯光。这声音，这灯光惹起人们心情的激动。我不禁想起了一个月以前的一幅情景来：
    那正是进行拖拉机试运转（并结合进行耙地）的时候，四月六日的晚上，我和作家协会的井同志都在苏联专家、农业总技师顾问克鲁基科夫同志的住室里，我们和专家像老朋友似地交谈着，谈到中苏人民的友谊，谈到农场的现在和未来，也谈到苏联人民正在进行的大规模开荒事业。克鲁基科夫同志说：“虽然我们的语言不同，我们的事业是共同的。我们两国人民是这样的相近。此刻在我的家乡，在我们的西伯利亚也和这里一样，正处在开荒的前夜。我们这里的生活是多么有生气，草原的夜晚又是多么美妙呵！辽阔的草原像一个蓝澄澄的海，这儿那儿到处闪耀着拖拉机的银花般的灯光……”他越讲越兴奋，拉着我们和同室住的几位苏联专家一同步出室外。这时，乌云升起了，遮住了月亮，浓雾笼罩着草原，拖拉机灯光穿过雾层发出银色光芒，草原沉醉在拖拉机的轰鸣——动人心弦的演奏里。
    克鲁基科夫同志大有感触地说：“同志们，请听，这有些像炮声，但这不是二十几年前日本帝国主义进攻中国东北的炮声；这也是一种进攻，这是苏联人民帮助自己的兄弟——中国人民向荒地、向大自然展开进攻，可以说是个伟大的进攻！”
    寒风吹乱老专家的头发，我们看不清他那兴奋而激动的面孔，我们却感觉到苏维埃人对中国人民由衷的爱和兄弟之情。这感情在友谊农场开荒的第一天，又一次在我的心头汹涌。
