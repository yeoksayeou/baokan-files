Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: Indian Chief Representative to the United Nations, Menon, left Beijing by plane at 7:30 AM on the 21st to return home.

Those who saw him off at the airport included Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China; Qiao Guanhua, Assistant Minister; Chen Jiakang, Assistant Minister and Director of the First Asian Department; Dong Yueqian, Director of the General Office; and Wang Zhuoru, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department.

Also present at the airport to see him off were Indian Ambassador to China, R.K. Nehru, Indonesian Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to China, Wiyo Wirjodojo, and others.

Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: Indian Chief Representative to the United Nations, Menon, made a statement to reporters at the airport this morning before leaving Beijing to return home. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    As I leave Beijing this morning after a ten-day stay in China on my first visit, the first thing I want to say to you is to express my pleasure in meeting the representatives of the Chinese press. You will forgive me for not being able to meet you until now, because you probably know that I have indeed been very busy. I would like to say that I will leave with pleasant memories of my stay in China, and I am deeply grateful to your Premier and your government for their care and attention, deep friendship and hospitality, and in such a short time when I was able to find time to walk around and see things, I was also very happy to see the happiness, efforts and enthusiasm of the Chinese people.

    Needless to say, the friendship and relations between our two countries not only have a long history, but at present, are an enduring factor in the rising solidarity and growing awakening of a rising Asia, and in the peace and prosperity of the people of all countries in the world. It is impossible for me to detail the many hours of talks I had with your Premier, and the talks I had with your senior leaders and politicians. But I think I have the right, or rather I have reason, to repeat what your Premier said to a journalist from my country yesterday morning. If I quote him correctly, he said: "These talks were very beneficial, and we can look forward to the future with hope." In these days, to think that political and social efforts are beneficial is a remarkable thing. This means that the rights before you are not useless, and you look forward to the future with hope. The results of our efforts do not depend on us. We can only make efforts in the right direction. India and China, I have no doubt, and the people of the whole world, have a common interest, and that is peace. We are not treating this issue as a new one, but as a continuation of the ties and relationships that already exist between our two countries, and as far as my visit is concerned, more particularly as a result of the private talks at the final stage of the Bandung Conference, when your Premier very earnestly expressed to my Premier the request that I come here to continue the talks, and my Premier accepted this request.

    Our governments and countries are in a fortunate position, or rather in a useful position, in that we have relations with both the Western world and with China. They have different characteristics, and we hope that no matter how different people are, no matter how much their opinions may differ, we hope and we believe that there is no question of motive. No matter how difficult this work may be, no matter how serious the crisis may be to lead to even more serious crises, the efforts made by our two countries will certainly achieve something. The obstacles we have to overcome are enormous. As far as we are concerned, we must entrust our destiny to the important goals we are seeking and to our desire to see a unified, prosperous and happy China, a friendly neighbor that is strong because of the prosperity and happiness of its people.

Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: Indian Chief Representative to the United Nations, Menon, who visited our country, left Beijing on May 21st to return to his country. During his stay in Beijing, Menon held talks with Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, on the 12th, 15th, 18th, 19th and 20th; held talks with Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council, on the 18th; and held talks with Qiao Guanhua, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, on the 13th, 14th and 17th.

In Beijing, Menon also visited the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill, the construction site of the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill, Peking University, the Central Institute for Nationalities, the Exhibition of Achievements of Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia, and toured Beihai Park, the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven and the Temple of Azure Clouds. He also watched Peking Opera and Chinese films. In addition, he attended banquets hosted by Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, and R.K. Nehru, Indian Ambassador to our country.

　　印度驻联合国首席代表梅农回国并发表谈话
    新华社二十一日讯　印度驻联合国首席代表梅农在二十一日上午七时三十分乘飞机离开北京回国。
    到机场欢送的有中华人民共和国外交部副部长章汉夫，部长助理乔冠华，部长助理兼第一亚洲司司长陈家康，办公厅主任董越千，礼宾司副司长王倬如。
    到机场欢送的还有印度驻我国大使赖嘉文，印度尼西亚驻我国大使馆临时代办维约维尔多约等。
    新华社二十一日讯　印度驻联合国首席代表梅农今晨在离京回国前在机场向记者发表谈话。谈话全文如下：
    在我初次访问中国逗留了十天后而将在今天上午离开北京的时候，我想要向诸位说的第一件事，就是表示我对会见中国新闻界的代表们感到的愉快。你们会原谅我在此以前一直没能会见你们，因为你们大概知道我的确是忙得脱不开身。我愿意说，我将怀着我在逗留中国期间的愉快记忆而离开，我深深感谢你们的总理和你们的政府的关怀和照料，深厚的友谊和款待，而且在我能够找出时间出来走走和看看的这样短暂的时机中，我也非常高兴看到中国人民的幸福、努力和热情。
    不用说，我们两国的友谊和关系不仅有悠久的历史，而且在目前，是在崛起的亚洲的日益加强的团结和日益提高的觉醒中以及在世界各国人民的和平和繁荣中的一个持久的因素。要我详细说明我同你们的总理进行的许多小时的会谈，以及我和你们的高级领袖和政治家进行的会谈，是不可能的。但是，我认为我有权利，或者说我有理由重复你们的总理昨天上午对我的国家一个记者说的话。如果我援引他的话引得正确的话，他是这样说的：“这次会谈是非常有益的，我们能够怀着希望瞻望将来”。在这些日子里，要认为政治和社会的努力是有益的，这就是了不起的事情。这就是说，不使摆在你面前的权利没有用处，并且怀着希望瞻望将来。我们的努力的结果不决定于我们。我们只能向着正确的方向作努力，印度和中国，我毫不怀疑，也是全世界人民，有着一个共同的利益，那就是和平。我们并没有把这个问题当作一个新问题来对待，而是把它当作我们两国之间已经存在的联系和关系的继续，而就我这次的访问来说，更特别是由于万隆会议最后阶段私下会谈的结果，当时你们的总理非常恳切地向我的总理表示，要求我到这里来继续会谈，我的总理接受了这个要求。
    我们的政府和国家处在幸运的地位，或者说是颇有用处的地位，就是我们同西方世界和同中国都有关系。它们有着不同的特性，我们希望不管人们怎样不同，他们的意见怎样不一致，我们希望并且我们相信并不存在动机问题。不论这种工作可能是多么困难，不论危机可能是严重到能够导向更严重的危机，我们两国作的努力一定会取得某种成就。我们将要克服的障碍是巨大的，就我们来说，我们必须把我们的命运寄托在我们正在寻求的重要的目标和我们希望看到一个统一、繁荣和幸福的中国，一个由于人民的繁荣和幸福而强大的友好邻国的愿望上面。
    新华社二十一日讯　来我国访问的印度驻联合国首席代表梅农已在五月二十一日离北京返国。梅农在北京期间，曾在十二日、十五日、十八日、十九日和二十日同中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来进行了会谈，在十八日同国务院副总理陈毅进行了会谈，在十三日、十四日和十七日同外交部部长助理乔冠华进行了会谈。
    梅农在北京还先后参观了国营北京第一棉纺织厂、国营北京第二棉纺织厂工地、北京大学、中央民族学院、捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会，游览了北海公园、颐和园、天坛和碧云寺，观看了京剧和中国电影。此外，他并曾分别出席了我国外交部副部长章汉夫和印度驻我国大使赖嘉文招待他的宴会。
