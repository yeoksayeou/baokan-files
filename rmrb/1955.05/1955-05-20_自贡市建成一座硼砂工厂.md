　　Zigong Salt Field in Sichuan Province has completed the construction of the state-owned Xinhua No. 1 Salt Factory’s borax and potassium co-production factory, which began in 1954. This is a mechanized borax factory. It will use the salt field's black brine and yellow brine to extract large quantities of borax. Borax is a raw material for welding flux used in metal welding, and it is also an indispensable raw material for industries such as glass, enamel, and medicine. After starting operation, it will first supply a large quantity of welding rods needed by the basic construction departments. According to its design capacity, the annual output of borax is equivalent to more than three and a half times the total current borax production of the Zigong Salt Field, which will save the country a large amount of foreign exchange each year.

　　This factory is the first mechanized borax and potassium co-production factory designed and manufactured by our country. It has five main factory buildings, including a condensing water tower, a cooking room, and an ice-making room. With the active efforts of construction workers and installation workers, the factory construction project only took more than four months from start to finish.

　  自贡市建成一座硼砂工厂
    四川自贡盐场从一九五四年动工兴建的国营新华第一制盐厂硼钾联产工厂，目前已经建成。这是一座机械化的硼砂工厂。它将利用盐场的黑卤和黄卤水提炼大量的硼砂。硼砂是焊接金属所用的焊药原料，也是玻璃、搪瓷和医药等工业不可少的原料。开工后它将首先大量供应基本建设部门焊接钢条的需要。根据它的设计能力，每年出产的硼砂相当于自贡盐场现有硼砂产量总和的三倍半以上，将可以每年为国家节省大笔外汇。
    这座工厂是我国自己设计、制造的第一座机械化硼钾联产工厂。它有冷凝水塔、蒸煮房、制冰房等五个主要厂房。在建筑工人、安装工人的积极努力下，建厂工程从动工起，只经过了四个多月的时间。
