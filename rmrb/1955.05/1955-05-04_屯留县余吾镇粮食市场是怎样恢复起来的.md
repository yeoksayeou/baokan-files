How the Grain Market in Yuwu Town, Tunliu County, Was Restored
	Wang Zhidao

Since the state implemented unified purchase and sale of grain, cotton, and oilseeds last winter, no grain had been listed on the primary market in Yuwu Town, Tunliu County, Shanxi Province. Township cadres and supply and marketing cooperative cadres generally had the illusion that the grain unified purchase task was large, and the peasants had sold all their surplus grain, so there would be no more grain transactions on the market. Therefore, the organization and leadership of the market was once relaxed, causing the market to gradually become depressed. Not only had grain transactions not recovered, but even small stalls selling sticky cakes and non-staple foods had closed down.

Did the peasants really have no surplus grain? Was the grain market really not needed? Absolutely not. Some peasants still had surplus grain, and the average peasants also needed to adjust grain varieties and temporarily sell grain for turnover. However, they had many concerns in their minds: fearing to reveal their wealth, fearing that others would say that the surplus grain was not sold thoroughly and the unified purchase task would be increased, fearing that they would not be able to buy it back after selling it, etc. Therefore, they dared not sell even if they should, and dared not exchange even if they wanted to. For example, the peasant Zhang Fuzhen was asked to sell 2,000 catties of grain during the unified purchase. At that time, he only sold 1,800 catties. Now he still has surplus grain and wants to sell it, but he dares not.

Since the peasants still have the demand to buy and sell surplus grain and exchange grain varieties, the market problem must be solved. On the thirteenth day of the twelfth lunar month last year, the peasant Li Baidan wanted to exchange some beans for soft rice because he did not have soft rice to steam New Year cakes for the New Year. He quietly went to the supply and marketing cooperative to ask if he could exchange it, but was simply rejected by the salesman of the supply and marketing cooperative. Li Baidan was not the only household without soft rice. They came to the supply and marketing cooperative again and again. Only then did Liu Xianlu, the director of the supply and marketing cooperative, feel that this was a problem. He thought: Could it be that the masses cannot eat New Year cakes for the New Year? The more he thought about it, the more he felt it was wrong, so he discussed it with Township Head Cui Changqing. Finally, both of them believed that this problem must be solved; therefore, they decided to divide the work and go deep into each household to mobilize them, so that the masses could mutually adjust with other grains and exchange for soft rice. Cui Changqing was in Yuwu, and Liu Xianlu went to Shanglian Township. As a result of their in-depth mobilization, they learned that seven households had soft rice, and everyone had the need to exchange other grains. They were afraid that others would say that they were "surplus grain households," so they did not dare to do so; after hearing the township head and the director of the supply and marketing cooperative say that they could take it to the market to exchange other grains, they were all prepared to exchange some. On the seventeenth day of the twelfth lunar month, Zhao Xiaosan first carried seventy catties of soft rice to the supply and marketing cooperative to exchange for beans and millet. The supply and marketing cooperative satisfied his request, and he automatically sold thirty catties of soft rice to the supply and marketing cooperative. Then Zhang Laibao also carried soft rice to exchange for corn, and others also brought soft rice to exchange for other grains they needed. The facts educated the cadres and corrected their illusions. The cadres began to realize the fact that the peasants who lacked grain were calling for a lack of grain, and those who did not lack grain were also calling for a lack of grain, and those who had surplus grain were still calling for a lack of grain, and the true lack of grain and the false lack of grain were mixed up; because their own minds were unclear, they believed the call that "there is no surplus grain," and gave up the leadership of the grain market. Therefore, the cadres began to pay attention to the leadership of the grain market, and the views of the salesmen of the supply and marketing cooperative also began to change.

As soon as the soft rice was on the market, the number of households requesting grain adjustment gradually increased, and they were all satisfactorily resolved. The agricultural cooperative led by Zhang Baoshan opened a flour mill and raised thirteen pigs. Because of the lack of raw materials, the flour mill was about to close down, and there was a lack of feed for raising pigs. The supply and marketing cooperative took the initiative to contact Zhang Baoshan and let the peasants exchange grain for vermicelli and flour. In this way, the flour mill continued to operate, and the pigs were also fattened. This cooperative also sold 1,300 catties of mung beans and 600 catties of sorghum exchanged to the supply and marketing cooperative. With the solution of one problem after another, the market became more lively day by day, and the peasants' many concerns were also dispelled. When Li Baidan first sold corn, he also asked the supply and marketing cooperative to give him a note, preparing to buy it again later; later, seeing that grain could be bought on the market, he did not even want a note when he sold grain again. Then many people did not want notes and sold grain to the supply and marketing cooperative happily. After the peasant Zhang Fushi exchanged two dou of millet for wheat, he immediately returned the New Year's wheat purchase certificate to the supply and marketing cooperative and said, "If I can adjust grain from the market, I don't need the state to supply it." According to incomplete statistics in January and February this year, the peasants exchanged 531 catties of soft rice with each other; exchanged 2,821 catties of other grains; and the supply and marketing cooperative purchased 6,479 catties of surplus grain on the market. With the support of the supply and marketing cooperative, the four stalls selling sticky cakes and other snacks also resumed business.

With the gradual listing of grain, Liu Xianlu, the director of the supply and marketing cooperative, and Cui Changqing, the township head, and others had confidence in the work of restoring the market. They convened a joint meeting of cadres of relevant departments through the Party branch, and studied the specific methods and steps for further restoring the market work. The supply and marketing cooperative also specially convened a meeting of cooperative affairs cadres to study relevant documents on how to activate and lead the primary market, and further criticized the idea of ​​ignoring the organization and leadership of the primary market. At the same time, township cadres and supply and marketing cooperative cadres also began to solve the problem that peasants had oilseeds but could not eat oil. They asked the higher authorities for instructions and decided to allow three agricultural production cooperatives to open oil mills to squeeze oil, allowing peasants to exchange raw materials for finished products. The peasants could exchange oilseeds for the edible oil they needed, and they sold the remaining oilseeds to the supply and marketing cooperative. The supply and marketing cooperative could not purchase oilseeds at first, but now the oilseeds they bought are increasing day by day. They purchased 13,789 catties of oilseeds in January and February.

After more than two months of restoration work, the Yuwu market has shown a prosperous and active new atmosphere. Peasants from surrounding townships are taking grain, oilseeds, etc. to Yuwu for exchange, interchanging what they have for what they lack.

　　屯留县余吾镇粮食市场是怎样恢复起来的
　　王志道
    自去年冬季国家对粮食、棉花、油料实行统购统销以后，山西省屯留县余吾镇初级市场就没有粮食上市了。乡干部和供销社干部，普遍产生了一种错觉，认为粮食统购任务大，农民已把余粮卖完，市场上再不会有粮食交易了。因此对市场的组织领导曾一度放松，致使市场逐渐萧条，不仅粮食交易没有恢复，连卖粘饼和副食品的小摊也停业了。
    农民真的没有余粮了吗？粮食市场真的不需要吗？完全不是的。一部分农民还是有余粮的，一般农民也是需要调剂粮食品种和暂时出卖粮食作周转的。但他们思想上存在着许多顾虑：怕露富，怕别人说余粮卖的不彻底要加重统购任务，怕卖了买不回来等等，所以该卖也不敢卖，想换也不敢换。如农民张富珍，统购时要他卖二千斤粮，当时他只卖了一千八百斤，现在还有余粮想卖，却又不敢卖。
    农民既然还有买卖余粮和调换粮食品种的要求，市场问题就必须解决。去年阴历腊月十三日，农民李白旦因过年没有软米蒸年糕，想拿些豆子调换软米，悄悄跑到供销社去问能不能换，被供销社的营业员简单地拒绝了。没软米的不只李白旦一户，他们三番两次地来找供销社，供销社主任刘先禄才觉得这是问题。他想：难道能让群众过年吃不上年糕吗？他越想越觉得不对，便同乡长崔长青商议。最后两人都认为这问题一定得解决；便决定分工深入各户去动员，让群众用其他粮食互相调剂，兑换软米。崔长青在余吾，刘先禄到上连乡。两人深入动员的结果，了解到七户有软米，而且大家都有调换其他粮食的要求。他们怕别人说自己是“余粮户”，所以不敢那样办；听乡长和供销社主任说可以拿到市场调换其他粮食，就都准备兑换一些。腊月十七日，赵小三首先背了七十斤软米到供销社换豆子和小米，供销社满足了他的要求，他又自动卖给了供销社三十斤软米。接着张来宝也背软米来换玉米，其他人也拿软米来换自己需要的别种粮食。事实教育了干部，纠正了他们的错觉。干部们开始认识到这样一个事实：现在缺粮的农民叫喊缺粮，不缺的也叫喊缺粮，余粮的还叫喊缺粮，真缺粮的和假缺粮的混淆起来；自己头脑不清，便把“都没余粮了”的叫喊信以为真，放弃了对粮食市场的领导。于是，干部对粮食市场的领导重视起来了，供销社营业员的观点也开始有了转变。
    软米一上市，要求调剂粮食的户数逐渐增多，并且都得到了圆满的解决。张保山领导的农业社开了一座粉房，喂猪十三口，因为原料不足，粉房快要停业，喂猪缺乏饲料；供销社主动同张保山接洽，让农民用粮食来换粉条、粉面。这样，粉房继续经营下来了，猪也喂肥了。这个社还把换来的绿豆一千三百斤、高粱六百斤卖给了供销社。随着一个个问题的解决，市场一天比一天热闹起来，农民的许多顾虑也打消了。李白旦最初卖玉米时，还让供销社给他打个条子，准备以后再买；后来看到市场上能够买到粮食，再卖粮时，连条子也不要了。接着有好多人都不要条子，爽爽快快地把粮食卖给了供销社。农民张福史以二斗小米换到小麦后，马上把年关购麦证退给了供销社，并说：“能从市场上调剂粮食，我就不用国家供应了。”据今年一、二月份不完全统计，农民互相调换了软米五百三十一斤；调换了其他粮食二千八百二十一斤；供销社在市场上收购了余粮六千四百七十九斤。四个卖粘饼等零食的小摊，经过供销社的支持，也恢复了营业。
    随着粮食的逐渐上市，供销社主任刘先禄和乡长崔长青等，对恢复市场工作有了信心。他们通过党支部召开了有关部门的干部联席会议，研究了进一步恢复市场工作的具体办法和步骤。供销社又专门召开了社务干部会，学习了如何活跃和领导初级市场的有关文件，进一步批判了忽视组织领导初级市场的思想。同时，乡干部和供销社干部又着手解决农民存有油料但吃不上油的问题。他们请示了上级，决定准许三个农业生产合作社开设油房榨油，让农民用原料来换成品。农民既能拿油料换到自己所需的食油，他们就把余下的油料卖给了供销社。供销社起初收购不到油料，现在买到的油料一天比一天多起来了，一、二两月即收购了油料一万三千七百八十九斤。
    经过两个多月的恢复工作，余吾市场已呈现出繁荣活跃的新气象。周围各个乡的农民，都拿粮食、油料等来余吾进行交换，互通有无。
