　　PLA Literary and Art Workers Chen Qitong and Thirty-Two Others
　　Angrily Denounce the Criminal Activities of the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique

　　(Dispatch) This newspaper reports that People's Liberation Army literary and art workers Chen Qitong, Chen Yading, Ma Hanbing, Lu Le, Yu Ji, Zhang Liyun, Na Di, Jiang Muliang, Hu Qi, Bai Ai, Tang Yu, Ye Yifeng, Li Wei, Liu Zhaojiang, Guo Guang, Xiao Ye, Ding Yi, Huang Cao, Lin Liuqi, Zhang Gui, Bai Hua, Xiao He, Gong Liu, Peng Jingfeng, Yao Leng, Lin Yu, Hu Guogang, Shi Lemeng, Du Feng, Zhang Zhimin, Feng Jiannan, Xu Hanru, and Gao Yubao, along with thirty-three others, have jointly written a letter to the Chinese Writers Association, expressing their anger at the criminal activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique.

　　The letter states: After reading the materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party clique revealed by Shu Wu, we feel extreme anger towards Hu Feng's consistent anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. Writers are engineers of the human soul, but we believe that a person like Hu Feng, who has consistently been anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary, disgraces the glorious title of "engineer of the human soul." Our revolutionary literary and art front must never allow such anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary elements to exist.

　　The letter puts forward two suggestions: 1. It is suggested to revoke Hu Feng's status as a deputy to the National People's Congress, expel him from membership in the Writers Association, his position as a council member of the Writers Association, and his position as an editorial board member of "People's Literature"; 2. It is suggested that the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association thoroughly investigate the counter-revolutionary criminal acts of the Hu Feng clique and urge Hu Feng and the core members of his clique to make a thorough confession.

　　解放军文艺工作者陈其通等三十三人
　　愤怒斥责胡风反党集团的罪恶活动
    本报讯　中国人民解放军文艺工作者陈其通、陈亚丁、马寒冰、鲁勒、虞棘、张立云、那狄、蒋牧良、胡奇、白艾、唐瑜、叶一峰、李伟、刘兆江、郭光、萧野、丁毅、荒草、蔺柳杞、张桂、白桦、晓河、公刘、彭荆风、姚冷、林予、胡果刚、时乐濛、杜烽、张志民、冯健男、许翰如和高玉宝等三十三人联名写信给中国作家协会，对胡风反党集团的罪恶活动表示愤怒。
    信上说：读了舒芜揭露的胡风反党集团的材料，对于胡风的一贯反党、反人民、反革命的活动，我们感到极大的愤怒。作家是人类灵魂的工程师，但是，像胡风这种一贯反党、反人民、反革命的分子，我们觉得他是有辱“人类灵魂的工程师”这一光荣称号的。我们革命的文艺阵营，绝不能允许这种反党、反人民、反革命的分子存在。
    信上提出两点建议：一、建议撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表，开除他作家协会的会籍、作家协会理事、“人民文学”编辑委员等职务；二、建议中国作家协会主席团，彻底追究胡风小集团的反革命罪恶行为，督促胡风及其小集团中的骨干分子彻底作出交代。
