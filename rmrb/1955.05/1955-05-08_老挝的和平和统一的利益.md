The representative of the Laotian Fighting Forces, Prince Souphanouvong, issued a statement expressing complete agreement with the joint statement of Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Katay Don Sasorith, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos. Prince Souphanouvong also pointed out that it was in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords, which stipulate that the Kingdom of Laos government and the Laotian Fighting Forces should directly seek a political solution, that the Laotian Fighting Forces held political meetings with the Kingdom of Laos government in order to find solutions conducive to peace, unity, and the completion of Laos' democracy and independence. Souphanouvong's statement also stated that for the sake of peace and the interests of the motherland, political meetings should be quickly resumed, and negotiations should continue based on the principles of equal consultation and mutual respect.

Now, all those who wish to see lasting peace and democratic unification in Laos are hoping that the joint statement of Pham Van Dong and Katay Don Sasorith can produce positive results in the current situation in Laos.

However, one cannot fail to notice the current situation arising from the actions of the Kingdom of Laos government in violating certain important provisions of the Geneva Accords and the spirit of the Pham Van Dong-Katay Don Sasorith joint statement. The Laotian Fighting Forces, who had assembled in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly in accordance with the Geneva Accords, have been subjected to incessant attacks. Although an agreement was reached on March 9 on the cessation of all hostilities, incidents of attacking the Laotian Fighting Forces and plundering the peaceful residents of the Laotian Fighting Forces' assembly areas continue to occur. At the same time, due to repeated difficulties created by the Kingdom side, the political conference has been intermittent, holding only eighteen days of meetings in three months and ten days, and the conference was interrupted again on April 21. On the second day after the Pham Van Dong-Katay Don Sasorith joint statement was issued, the Kingdom government also created excuses, insisting that the suggestions of the Laotian Fighting Forces delegation were unconstitutional, and unilaterally delayed the political conference. At the same time, the United States is using the situation in Laos to direct remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to invade Laos in separate groups, attack the Laotian Fighting Forces, and gather near the Chinese-Burmese border region, which not only harms Laos' sovereignty and undermines the ceasefire, but also threatens the security of China and Burma.

Clearly, the current situation in Laos will only benefit the US interventionists' conspiracy to further undermine peace and unity in Laos. After the Bangkok Conference, US Secretary of State Dulles openly incited the "suppression" of the Laotian Fighting Forces and claimed that such "suppression" would receive the "protection" of the Southeast Asia Treaty. Recently, military experts from the eight Southeast Asia Treaty countries held a military conference in Baguio, which reportedly made "urgent considerations" for the so-called "defense needs" of Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam. It is very clear that the United States is eager to step up its intervention in the situation in Indochina. Part of its plan is to expand the military conflict in Laos, obstruct democratic general elections, and undermine the Geneva Accords. This is incompatible with the interests of peace, unity, and independence in Laos.

The reason for the recent interruption of the Laotian political conference is that the Kingdom of Laos government insists on first resolving the issue of establishing Kingdom administrative management in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly and the issue of isolating the Laotian Fighting Forces and the "Kingdom Army" in this region; before these issues are resolved, there will be no discussion of general elections and other political issues. It is clear that the Kingdom's position is one-sided and unreasonable.

As everyone knows, the Laotian Fighting Forces have repeatedly expressed their respect for the Kingdom government and announced that in principle, the Laotian administrative organs in Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces are under the highest supervision of the Kingdom government. Therefore, the administrative management issue in these two provinces can be resolved fairly and reasonably in a way that is conducive to Laos' democratic unification during consultations between the two sides on the issues of general elections and democratic rights. Isolating this issue as a prerequisite for continuing negotiations actually means unwillingness to reach a fair and reasonable solution based on respect for democratic rights.

As for the so-called "isolation" issue, it is even more of a fabrication. Article 14 of the Geneva Conference's agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Laos stipulates that Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces are assembly areas for the Laotian Fighting Forces. Article 19 stipulates that the armed forces of each party shall respect the territory under the military control of other party. Before the cessation of hostilities, the Laotian Fighting Forces had liberated half of Laos' territory and nearly half of the country's population. Among them, Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces had been completely liberated as early as April 1953 and early 1954, respectively, and Laotian administrative organs and troops existed in all other provinces throughout the country. However, based on the desire to seek peace and national independence and democracy, the Laotian Fighting Forces, in accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement, withdrew from large liberated areas in ten provinces and assembled in Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces. This is a patriotic manifestation of the Laotian Fighting Forces' loyalty to the motherland's peace and democratic unification, and no one can deny it.

In the assembly areas of the Laotian Fighting Forces in Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces, the Laotian Kingdom forces no longer existed. However, after the cessation of hostilities, the Kingdom government, in accordance with the intentions of US imperialism, attempted to resolve the issue of these two provinces by military means, airlifting or sending officers and troops by land into the two provinces, gathering bandits scattered in this area, and adding the symbol of the "Kingdom Army" to them. This is how the Kingdom forces and its "resident areas" were created. This kind of practice makes people suspect that it is intended to completely squeeze the Laotian Fighting Forces out of their assembly areas. The Laotian Fighting Forces have repeatedly requested the Laotian Kingdom forces to withdraw from the two provinces. The International Control Commission in Laos has also conducted dozens of investigations. In its recently published first report, the committee affirmed that the French-Laotian side had airdropped personnel and supplies in areas such as Ounua and Outhai in the two provinces after the armistice, and that the armed forces commanded or controlled by the French-Laotian side had attacked strongholds of the Laotian Fighting Forces and looted the peaceful residents of the two provinces. Therefore, according to the armistice agreement, the Laotian Kingdom government should withdraw its troops from the two provinces, and should not violate the Geneva Accords by invading the assembly areas of the Laotian Fighting Forces and then demanding "isolation" of the two sides' troops. This is a clear and obvious matter. The Kingdom government's demand, which violates the Geneva Armistice Agreement, as a prerequisite for resolving the political problems of Laos is tantamount to trying to resolve the problem by military means. And this method has already proven to be unworkable and dangerous to the peace of Laos. For the sake of peace and democratic unification in Laos, the Laotian political conference should be resumed immediately, and these issues should be resolved through sincere consultation.

### 老挝的和平和统一的利益

　　老挝的和平和统一的利益
　　胡今
    寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯亲王发表了声明，表示完全同意越南民主共和国副总理范文同和老挝王国首相克特的联合声明，苏发努冯亲王并且指出，正是根据应由老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方按照日内瓦协议直接谋求政治解决的精神，寮国战斗部队同老挝王国政府举行了政治会议，以便找出有利于和平、统一并完成老挝的民主和独立的解决办法。苏发努冯的声明还表示，为了和平和祖国的利益，应该迅速恢复政治会议，根据平等协商和互相尊重的原则继续谈判。
    现在，所有愿意看到老挝的持久和平和民主统一的人们，都在期望范文同和克特的联合声明，能够在目前的老挝局势中产生积极的结果。
    但是人们却不能不注意到目前由于老挝王国政府方面违背日内瓦协定某些重要条款和范文同—克特联合声明的精神的行动而产生的局势。按照日内瓦协定而集结在桑怒和丰沙里两省的寮国战斗部队，遭到没有休止的进攻。虽然在三月九日双方已就停止一切敌对行动问题达成了协议，但是，进攻寮国战斗部队、抢掠寮国战斗部队集结地区和平居民的事情仍不断发生。同时，由于王国方面一再制造困难，政治会议时断时续，在三个月零十天中只举行了十八天会议，到四月二十一日会议又遭到中断。就在范文同—克特联合声明发表的第二天，王国政府还制造借口，硬说寮国战斗部队代表团方面的建议违宪，片面延搁政治会议。同时美国还在利用老挝的局势，指使蒋贼集团残匪分股侵入老挝，袭击寮国战斗部队，并在接近中、缅边境地区集结，这不仅有损老挝的主权，破坏停战，而且威胁中、缅的安全。
    显然，老挝目前的这种情况，只会有利于美国干涉者进一步破坏老挝和平和统一的阴谋计划。美国国务卿杜勒斯曾在曼谷会议以后，公开煽动对寮国战斗部队的“镇压”，并且声言这种“镇压”行动会得到东南亚条约的“保护”。最近，东南亚条约八国军事专家在碧瑶举行了军事会议，据透露已对泰国、老挝、柬埔寨和南越的所谓“防御需要”作了“紧急考虑”。这就十分清楚，美国正急于要加紧干涉印度支那局势。作为它的计划的一部分的，就是扩大在老挝的军事冲突，阻挠民主普选，破坏日内瓦协定。这是同老挝的和平、统一和独立的利益不能相容的。
    最近老挝政治会议又陷中断的原因，是老挝王国政府坚持要先解决在桑怒和丰沙里两省建立王国行政管理问题和在这个地区隔离寮国战斗部队和
  “王国军队”的问题；在这些问题未解决之前，根本不谈普选和其他政治问题。很显然，王国方面这个立场是片面的不合理的。
    大家知道，寮国战斗部队早已一再表示他们尊重王国政府，并宣布在原则上丰沙里和桑怒两省的寮国行政机构在王国政府的最高监督之下。因此，这两省的行政管理问题，完全能够在双方解决普选和民主权利问题的协商中，得到有利于老挝民主统一的公平合理的解决。把这个问题孤立开来作为继续谈判的先决条件，实际上就是不愿意在尊重民主权利的基础上取得公平合理的解决。
    至于所谓“隔离”问题，更是无中生有地制造出来的。日内瓦会议关于老挝停止敌对行动协定第十四条规定，丰沙里和桑怒两省是寮国战斗部队的集结地区。第十九条规定，每一方的武装力量应尊重另一方军事控制下的领土。在敌对行动停止以前，寮国战斗部队已解放了老挝的一半领土，解放了全国人口的将近一半。其中桑怒、丰沙里二省早在一九五三年四月及一九五四年初即已先后全部解放，在全国其他所有省份中都存在寮国的行政机构和军队。但寮国战斗部队本着谋求和平和国家独立和民主的愿望，遵照停战协定的规定，从十个省的大片已解放地区撤出，集结到丰沙里和桑怒两省。这是寮国战斗部队忠于祖国的和平和民主统一的爱国表现，这是谁也不能否认的。
    在丰沙里和桑怒两省的寮国战斗部队集结地区，本已不存在老挝王国部队。但是在敌对行动停止后，王国政府方面按照美帝国主义的意图，企图用军事办法来解决这两省的问题，就空投或从陆路派遣军官和部队侵入两省地区，并聚集分散在这个地区的匪徒，强征当地青年，加以“王国军队”符号。这样才制造了王国部队和它的“驻区”。这种作法使人怀疑是要把寮国战斗部队完全排挤出它们的集结地区。寮国战斗部队曾一再要求老挝王国部队从两省地区撤出。老挝国际委员会也曾进行了数十次的调查。在最近发表的第一次报告中，委员会肯定了法国—老挝方曾在停战后在两省的乌怒、乌西等地空投人员和物资，而法国—老挝方所指挥或控制的武装力量曾进攻寮国战斗部队的据点，劫掠两省的和平居民。因此，根据停战协定，老挝王国政府理应从两省撤出部队，而不应违反日内瓦协议，侵入寮国战斗部队集结地区，然后又要求“隔离”双方部队，这是明明白白的事。王国政府以这一违反日内瓦停战协定的要求作为解决老挝政治问题的先决条件，无异是想用军事的办法来解决问题。而这种办法已经证明是行不通的，而且对老挝的和平是危险的。为了老挝的和平和民主统一的利益，老挝政治会议应该立即恢复，并以真诚的协商来解决这些问题。
