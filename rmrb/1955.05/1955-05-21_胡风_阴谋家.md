　　Hu Feng - Conspirator
　　Tian Jian
    Before Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" was published, people somewhat felt that Hu Feng and his clique were ambitiously stepping on the heads of the people, being enemies of the people, and attacking the Party. However, Hu Feng's anti-Party activities have been going on for so long, so resolutely, like a vicious wolf, mixed in the revolutionary ranks, and only recently has his true face been completely exposed.
    This is such a dangerous thing!
    This reminds me of when I was in Shanghai twenty years ago. Due to my own naiveté and ignorance, I made friends with a vicious wolf, taking his "encouragement" as a good intention, without realizing that it was ulterior motives. The attack orders he issued against me at several meetings in recent years can explain this. Because I did not treat his "encouragement" as a yoke to be worn forever, and opposed him, it aroused his anger. Looking at it now, if I had not joined the Party earlier and worked under the leadership of the Party, I might have been pulled away by this vicious wolf.
    One of the conspirator's methods is to treat his "encouragement" to others as capital and a special means for carrying out conspiratorial activities.
    Now, I must state that before Hu Feng commented on my early works, I had already received a lot of encouragement from other comrades, and I had already joined the "Left League." What truly guided me onto the path of revolutionary literature was always our Party, the Communist Party.
    For a long time, I regarded Hu Feng as a friend. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, because he was in the Great Rear Area and I was behind enemy lines, I knew very little about his activities in the rear area during that period. I always thought that he had done some progressive work; therefore, after the national liberation, I repeatedly advised him, hoping that he would get close to the Party and be able to serve the people. In 1949, when I was in Zhangjiakou, I wrote him a letter, advising him to pay attention to strengthening the unity between literary and art comrades and to remove the historical barriers in literary and art disputes. At that time, he wrote to me saying that this "historical barrier" "I am afraid it will have to be carried forever."
    In the past few years in Beijing, I know that many other comrades have also patiently advised him and persuaded him, but all of these, in his heart, are completely pressures on him, always holding a hostile attitude. On the surface, he always claimed that no one paid attention to him. Could it be that adopting his views to transform us and transform the Party is considered paying attention to him?
    For a period of time, he pretended to be silent. In reality, he was actively preparing to launch a major attack on the people's literary and art movement, an attack on the Party. Some people also thought that he was really silent. Now, this conspirator's mask has been exposed.
    We once regarded him as a friend, as a human being, but he used smiles to cover up contempt to deal with us. We have been insulted, we have been humiliated.
    From this, we know that no amount of advice is useful for conspirators. It is useless for those who use "cluster hand grenades." Let us be careful, in front of the hand grenades, there are also smoke bombs; behind the smoke bombs, the conspirator's hand is still holding weapons.
    Now is the time for the conspirator and his clique to lay down their weapons. We must make them lay down their weapons!

　　胡风——阴谋家
　　田间
    在舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”发表以前，人们多少感觉到，胡风和他的集团是野心勃勃地把脚踏在人民的头上，和人民为敌，向党进攻。但是，胡风的反党活动已经是这么久，是这么坚决，像一条恶狼似的，混在革命阵营里，直到最近，他的面目才彻底暴露了。
    这是多么危险的事！
    这使我回忆到，二十年前在上海的时候，由于自己的幼稚无知，和一条恶狼交了朋友，把他的“鼓励”当作是好意，而不知道这是别有用心。这几年来，他在几次会议上对我所下的攻击令，就可以说明。由于我没有把他的“鼓励”当成一个枷锁，永远套在身上，并且反对了他，因而引起他的愤怒。现在看来如果不是我较早地参加了党，在党的领导下工作，我就有可能被这条恶狼拉走的。
    阴谋家的手法之一，就是把自己对别人的“鼓励”当作进行阴谋活动的资本和一种特殊的手段。
    现在，我必须说明，在胡风评论我的早期创作以前，我已经得到其他同志很多的鼓励，我已经参加了“左联”。真正引导我走上革命文学的道路的，始终是我们的党，共产党。
    在一个很长的时间以内，我是把胡风当做朋友看待的。抗日战争中，由于他在大后方，我在敌后，这一个期间，他在后方的活动，我知道得很少，总以为他是做了一些进步的工作；因此，在全国解放以后，我才几次地劝告他，希望他靠近党，能为人民服务。一九四九年，我在张家口的时候，给他写了一封信，劝告他注意加强文艺战友之间的团结，去掉那些在文艺论争中历史的隔膜。当时他给我来信说，这个“历史的隔膜”“恐怕要永远背下去的”。
    在北京的这几年中，我知道，还有许多同志，都曾经耐心地劝告过他，说服过他，但是这一些，在他的内心看来，完全是对他的压力，始终抱着敌对的态度。在表面上，他总是扬言没有什么人理他。难道是采用他的主张，来改造我们，来改造党，才算是理了他？
    有一个时期，他假装沉默，实际上，是在积极准备大举向人民文艺运动进攻，向党进攻。有的人也以为他真的是在沉默，现在，这个阴谋家的假面具是被揭穿了。
    我们曾经把他当朋友看，当人看，然而他倒是以微笑包着侮蔑，来对付我们。我们是被侮蔑了，我们是被污辱了。
    从此我们知道，什么劝告，对于阴谋家是无用的。对于使用“集束手榴弹”的人是无用的。我们当心吧，在手榴弹的前面，还有烟幕弹；在烟幕弹的后面，阴谋家的手上，还握着武器。
    现在是阴谋家及其集团放下武器的时候了，我们一定要他们放下武器！
