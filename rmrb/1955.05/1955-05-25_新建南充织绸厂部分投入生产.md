　　Partial Production Begins at Newly Built Nanchong Silk Weaving Factory
    The Nanchong Silk Weaving Factory, the largest motorized silk weaving factory in Southwest China, officially began partial production on May 13th. Thirty-eight of the newly installed forty wide silk weaving machines have already started producing silk jacquard quilt covers.
    Since its establishment in November 1954, the factory has received assistance from a large number of machines and skilled workers from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places. The construction and installation tasks of the warp and weft workshop and the silk weaving workshop were completed on schedule at the end of March this year. After trial operation in early April, production began. It has now woven 800 silk jacquard quilt covers. At present, all the factory workers are full of confidence and preparing to meet new production tasks. By the fourth quarter, the factory will have ninety-four narrow silk weaving machines put into production. At that time, it will produce more than 150,000 silk jacquard quilt covers and more than 930,000 meters of special grade silk satin for the country annually to supply international trade and domestic needs.

　　新建南充织绸厂部分投入生产
    西南最大的电机织绸厂——南充织绸厂从五月十三日起部分正式投入生产。新安装的四十部宽织绸机已经有三十八部开始生产真丝提花被面。
    这个厂从一九五四年十一月开始筹建以后，得到了上海、杭州等地的大批机器和技术工人的援助。今年三月底按期完成了经纬车间和织绸车间的修建安装任务，于四月初试车后开始生产，现在已经织出真丝提花被面八百床。目前全厂职工正满怀信心地准备迎接新的生产任务。到第四季度这个厂将有九十四部窄织绸机投入生产。那时每年将为国家生产十五万多床真丝提花被面，九十三万多公尺特号绸缎，供应国际贸易和国内的需要。
