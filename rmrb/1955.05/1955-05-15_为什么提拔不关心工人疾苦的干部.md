To the Editor:

　　He Wusheng, the chairman of the trade union of the No. 2 Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau, has been promoted to the vice-chairman of the mining area trade union. This news has caused great surprise and dissatisfaction among the people.

　　Everyone remembers that in the incident of the death of old worker Niu Dashun from poverty and illness at the No. 2 Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau (revealed on the "Reader's Letters" page on February 20), He Wusheng showed a serious and bad work style of not caring about the suffering of workers: After Niu Dashun was unreasonably suspended from his job for introspection, his life was extremely difficult, and He Wusheng knew about this situation but did not care about it; after Niu Dashun died of illness, the CPC Yangquan Municipal Committee and the Yangquan Municipal Trade Union jointly inspected the incident, He Wusheng also took a resistant attitude and never made a profound self-criticism. The Yangquan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has decided to remove him from his position as a member of the executive committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for such a trade union cadre; however, the Yangquan Mining Area Trade Union promoted him from the chairman of the No. 2 Mine Trade Union to the vice-chairman of the Mining Area Trade Union. This practice is really difficult for people to understand.

　　It is said that the decision to promote He Wusheng was made before the Niu Dashun incident was revealed. This means that when making this decision, the superiors did not know about He Wusheng's situation. However, this statement cannot cover up the error of this decision. After the Niu Dashun incident occurred, He Wusheng's erroneous ideological style was revealed, and they should have changed this erroneous decision. Otherwise, a trade union cadre who does not care about the suffering of workers is promoted after the error is revealed, which has a very bad impact on the masses.

　　I request the leaders of the Yangquan Mining Bureau to promptly and seriously deal with He Wusheng's mistakes and correct this wrong promotion.

### 为什么提拔不关心工人疾苦的干部

　　为什么提拔不关心工人疾苦的干部编辑同志：
    阳泉矿务局二矿工会主席贺戊生被提拔为矿区工会的副主席了。这个消息引起人们极大的惊异和不满。
    大家记得，在阳泉矿务局二矿老工人牛大顺贫病致死事件（已在二月二十日“读者来信专页”上揭露）中，贺戊生表现了严重的不关心工人疾苦的恶劣作风：牛大顺被无理停职反省后，生活极端困苦，贺戊生知道了这个情况而不加过问；在牛大顺病死后，中共阳泉市委和阳泉市工会联合对这个事件进行检查，贺戊生还采取抗拒态度，并且始终没有作出深刻的检讨。对这样的一个工会干部，阳泉市工会联合会已决定撤销他市工会联合会执行委员的职务；但是阳泉矿区工会却把他从二矿工会主席提拔为矿区工会副主席，这种做法实在叫人很难理解。
    据说，提拔贺戊生的决定是在牛大顺事件被揭露以前就作出的。这就是说，在作出这个决定时，上级还不知道贺戊生的情况。但是，这种说法并不能掩盖这一决定的错误。在牛大顺事件发生后，贺戊生的错误思想作风被揭露了，他们应该改变这个错误的决定。否则，一个不关心工人疾苦的工会干部在错误被揭露以后反而提升了，这在群众中造成的影响是很坏的。
    我要求阳泉矿务局领导方面迅速严肃处理贺戊生的错误，并纠正这种错误的提拔。
