　　Macmillan Discusses Top-Level Negotiations

　　Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Reuters reported that British Foreign Secretary Macmillan said in the House of Commons on the 5th that Britain and its allies are currently working together to seek early discussions with the Soviet Union on many of the outstanding issues facing the world.
　　With the British parliamentary elections approaching, the Conservative Party will take advantage of the voters' strong desire for a swift convening of a four-power summit to ease international tensions. Considering this, Macmillan also spoke about this issue, saying: "There is no doubt that we will redouble our efforts in the future to seek four-power negotiations, and if possible, meetings between the heads of the four governments, so that in any case, a foundation for further progress can be reached."
　　Xinhua News Agency Dispatch on the 7th, TASS Washington Dispatch on the 6th: The US State Department announced on the 5th that the US attitude towards holding a four-power summit remains unchanged. When State Department spokesman White was asked whether the US had previously advocated holding a foreign ministers' conference before holding a four-power summit, White replied: "As far as I know, it has not changed." He also said that the US attitude towards holding top-level talks had "not changed in the slightest."

　　麦克米伦谈最高级谈判问题
    据新华社讯　路透社报道，英国外交大臣麦克米伦五日在下院说，目前英国和它的盟国在一起，将设法早日同苏联讨论许多摆在世界面前的悬而未决的问题。
    英国议会选举即将来临，保守党将利用选民坚决要求迅速召开四国政府领袖会议以缓和国际局势的愿望，麦克米伦考虑到这点，又谈到这个问题说：“没有疑问，我们今后将加倍努力求得举行四国谈判，如果可能，则在四国政府首脑之间举行会谈，以便无论如何要达成一个可以进一步作出进展的基础。”
    新华社七日讯　塔斯社华盛顿六日讯：美国国务院五日宣布，美国对举行四国首脑会议的问题的态度没有改变。有人向国务院发言人怀特提出问题：美国曾经主张在举行四国首脑会议之前应先举行外长会议，美国这个主张是不是没有改变。怀特回答说：“据我所知，没有改变”。他并且说美国对举行最高级会谈的问题的态度“没有丝毫改变”。
