Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 21st. Approximately two thousand civilians who were forcibly relocated to the South returned to the North by ship on the afternoon of the 20th, and were welcomed by people from all walks of life in Haiphong.

Many of those returning were ill and dressed in rags. Among them, more than a dozen were seriously injured in the armed conflicts between Ngo Dinh Diem's army and the sectarian armies. Many of those who returned this time had been coerced into going to the South in the months following the ceasefire, and many were Catholics. There were also some whose hometowns were in North Vietnam. They had lived in the South for more than ten years and, knowing that their hometowns had been liberated and that social order was good, returned to their hometowns with the old and the young.

Those who returned said that the French and Ngo Dinh Diem authorities in South Vietnam unreasonably prevented those who had moved south from returning to their hometowns. They were able to return to the North only after many struggles, which finally forced the southern authorities to send them back by ship. However, many more people who wanted to return to the North could not obtain travel permits and were unable to return.

The Haiphong authorities have set up temporary resting places for the compatriots returning to the North, and prepared tea, glutinous rice, as well as ambulances and aid stations to treat the sick and injured. Those whose homes were far away were sent by train that night to Hai Duong, and then transferred back to their hometowns.

　　又有两千名被迫南迁的北越居民返回海防
    他们受到海防市人民的欢迎和政府的妥善照顾
    新华社河内二十一日电　海防市各界人民二十日下午欢迎被迫南迁的平民约二千人乘船返回北部。
    许多回来的人都患病，而且衣服褴褛。在回来的人中还有十几个人在吴庭艳军队和教派军队的武装冲突中受重伤。这次回来的人有许多是在停战后这几个月内被胁迫到南部去的，有不少是天主教徒。还有一部分人家乡在北越，他们在南部已居住了十多年，知道家乡已经解放，社会秩序良好，就扶老携幼的回故乡来。
    回来的人说，南越法国和吴庭艳当局无理阻拦南迁的人返回家乡，他们所以能返回北部是经过多次斗争，终于迫使南部当局派船送回来。但更多的要求北来的人领不到通行证，不能回来。
    海防市当局为返回北部的同胞设立了暂时休息的地方，并且准备了茶水、糯米饭，还设有救护车、救护站，为患病和受伤的人治疗。家在远处的人，即有列车当夜送到海阳，再转送返乡。
