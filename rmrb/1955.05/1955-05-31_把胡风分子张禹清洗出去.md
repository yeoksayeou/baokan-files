　　Clean Out Hu Feng Element Zhang Yu
　　Zhang Yu (alias Wang Sixiang), who actively participated in Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary conspiracy, was a Hu Feng element lurking in Anhui and one of the key members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. During the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" in 1950, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique attempted to use this opportunity to attack the Party, disrupt and alienate the relationship between the Party and literary workers, in order to achieve their counter-revolutionary goals. The "vanguard" of that attack on the Party was this Zhang Yu we are talking about. He repeatedly wrote articles to "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette), launching personal attacks on the Party's responsible comrades in literary work, plotting to turn this historically significant and serious struggle against bourgeois reactionary ideology into an anti-Party and counter-revolutionary struggle.
　　After the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique were exposed, the ringleader Hu Feng immediately instructed his henchmen to retreat, and Zhang Yu was a faithful executor of this instruction. He took advantage of the Anhui Daily's lack of knowledge of his reactionary background and tricked them into publishing his "Brief Discussion on Hu Feng's 'Philosophical Basis'" in the Anhui Daily, attempting to muddle through and hide himself in order to continue engaging in anti-Party and anti-people criminal activities. But he is still a member of the Anhui Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and a member of the Federation's Provincial Committee. Thinking about it, it sends chills down our spines.
　　As members of the Anhui Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, according to Article 8 of the charter, we request the Standing Committee of the Anhui Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles to take immediate measures to remove this key member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique who has infiltrated, in order to purify our revolutionary literary and art ranks. At the same time, we also solemnly warn Zhang Yu and other Hu Feng elements lurking in the Anhui area: they must thoroughly confess all their reactionary activities with the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and they are not allowed to play any tricks to deceive the people!

　　把胡风分子张禹清洗出去 　 谢竟成　夏永安　曹玉模　陆路　徐文静
    积极参与胡风反革命阴谋活动的张禹（即王思翔），是潜伏在安徽的胡风分子，也是胡风反革命集团的骨干之一。在一九五○年批判“武训传”的时候，胡风反革命集团就曾企图利用这个机会，向党进攻，破坏和离间党和文艺工作者的关系，以达到他们的反革命的目的。那一次向党进攻的“急先锋”，便是我们所说的这个张禹。他一而再的写文章到“文艺报”，对文艺工作方面党的负责同志进行人身攻击，阴谋把这个富有历史意义的、反对资产阶级反动思想的严肃斗争，变为一个反党反革命的斗争。
    胡风反革命集团的罪恶被揭发以后，元凶胡风立即指示他的爪牙退却，而张禹又是这个指示的忠实执行者。他利用安徽日报不了解他的反动底细，骗得在安徽日报上发表了他的“略论胡风的‘哲学根据’”，企图借此蒙混过关，把自己隐藏起来，以便继续从事反党、反人民的罪恶活动。可是他现在还是安徽省文学艺术工作者联合会的会员、和文联全省委员会的委员，想起来，真叫人出了一身冷汗。
    作为安徽省文学艺术工作者联合会的会员，根据会章第八条的规定，我们请求安徽省文学艺术工作者联合会常务委员会，立即采取措施，把这个混进来的胡风反革命集团的骨干分子清除出去，以纯洁我们革命的文艺队伍。同时我们也严正地警告张禹和其他潜藏在安徽地区的胡风分子：他们必须彻底交代自己和胡风反革命集团的一切反动活动，决不容许他们玩弄任何手段，对人民进行欺骗蒙混！
