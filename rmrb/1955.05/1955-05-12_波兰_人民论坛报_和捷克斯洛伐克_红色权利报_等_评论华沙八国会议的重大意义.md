Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 11th -- According to a report by the Polish News Agency, Warsaw, on the 10th: The Polish "People's Tribune" published an article commenting on the second meeting of the European countries' conference to guarantee European peace and security, scheduled to be held in Warsaw on the 11th.

The article said that the goal of the Warsaw Conference is to conclude a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between the European countries of the socialist camp, and to establish a joint command of the eight treaty participating countries. This is our united response to the threat to peace posed by West German remilitarization.

The article continued: The struggle against launching a new world war and against the revival of aggressive German militarism is still ongoing. These countries of ours must clearly and unambiguously express their attitude towards the Paris Agreements. The countries of the socialist camp must closely unite their ranks and warn the aggressors that an attack on any country in the socialist camp will be met with a devastating counterattack from all of us.

The article concluded: Poland, in particular, has reason to be vigilant when our murderers of yesterday are acquiring weapons, and therefore it is particularly concerned about this alliance of socialist camp countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 11th -- "Red Right" published an editorial on the 11th, welcoming the convening of the Warsaw Conference of European countries to guarantee European peace and security.

The editorial said that the countries of the peace camp, in view of the increasing danger of war, cannot leave themselves unprepared for the development of events.

The editorial emphasized that our strength is the strength of peace. Although we must take further measures to guarantee our freedom and independence, we do not cease to struggle for the establishment of a European collective security system.

The "Red Right" editorial expressed that the Czechoslovak people will firmly support their representatives attending the Warsaw Conference. The editorial said that we will implement in all aspects all the decisions to be adopted at the Warsaw Conference that will help strengthen our security.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th -- The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 11th regarding the Warsaw Conference of European countries to guarantee European peace and security, saying that the Warsaw Conference is part of the peace-defending policy of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and China. The convening of this conference in the current situation is fully in line with the wishes and interests of millions of people in the world. It will certainly strengthen the iron-like unity between peace-loving European countries, and strengthen the defense forces of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The strengthening of the defense forces of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is a solid backing for mankind and a strong fortress to stop aggressive wars.

The commentary continued, the people of the world firmly support the convening of the Warsaw Conference, and will more actively and bravely grasp their own destiny and resolutely smash the provocative policies of American imperialism and its accomplices.

　　评论华沙八国会议的重大意义
    新华社华沙十一日电　据波兰通讯社华沙十日讯：波兰“人民论坛报”发表文章，评论定于十一日在华沙召开的欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议的第二次会议。
    文章说，华沙会议以缔结社会主义阵营欧洲各国间的友好、合作和互助条约、设立八个条约参加国的联合司令部为目标。这是我们对于西德重新军国主义化对和平所造成的威胁而作的联合答复。
    文章接着说：反对发动新世界战争、反对复活侵略性的德国军国主义的斗争，仍在继续进行中。我们这些国家必须清楚地和毫不含糊地表明它们对巴黎协定的态度。社会主义阵营的各个国家必须紧密团结自己的队伍，向侵略者发出警告：对社会主义阵营中任何一国的进攻，都将遭到我们全体的摧毁性的反击。
    文章最后说：波兰特别有理由在我们昨天的谋杀者正在获得武器的时候保持警惕，因此，它对社会主义阵营国家的这种联合是特别关切的。
    新华社布拉格十一日电　“红色权利报”十一日发表社论，欢迎欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全的华沙会议的召开。
    社论说，和平阵营的国家鉴于战争危险的增加，不能使自己对事件的发展无所准备。
    社论强调说，我们的力量是和平的力量。虽然我们必须采取进一步的措施来保障我们的自由和独立，但是，我们并不停止为建立欧洲集体安全体系而斗争。
  “红色权利报”的社论表示捷克斯洛伐克人民将坚决支持他们出席华沙会议的代表，社论说，我们将在各个方面执行华沙会议上将要通过的有助于加强我们的安全的一切决定。
    新华社河内十一日电　越南“人民报”十一日就欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议的华沙会议发表评论说，华沙会议是以苏联和中国为首的和平民主阵营保卫和平的政策的一部分。这个会议在目前情势下召开，是完全符合于世界千百万人民的愿望和利益的。它一定将加强爱好和平的欧洲各国间的钢铁般的团结，加强苏联和各人民民主国家的国防力量。苏联和各人民民主国家国防力量的加强，是人类稳固的靠山，是制止侵略战争的坚强的堡垒。
    评论接着说，全世界人民坚决拥护华沙会议的召开，并将更加积极勇敢地掌握自己的命运，坚决粉碎美帝国主义和它的帮凶的挑衅政策。
