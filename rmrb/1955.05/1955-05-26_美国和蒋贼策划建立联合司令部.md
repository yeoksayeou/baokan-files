Xinhua News Agency, May 25th Dispatch from Washington: According to a report by the Washington "Star's" Taipei correspondent on the 24th, the establishment of the Taiwan Liaison Center under the guidance of U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Pride has laid the foundation for the establishment of a U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek joint command. Once a war breaks out, this liaison center will become the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek joint command. The proposed U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek joint command, in addition to commanding the Seventh Fleet, will also command U.S. air force units and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, navy, and air force.

The "Star" said that when the United States initially wanted to establish a U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek joint command, it found that Taiwan's communication equipment was extremely inadequate and could not meet the needs of any U.S. commander. Therefore, the United States shipped a large number of radios and other telecommunications equipment to Taiwan and some outlying islands. The United States also sent technicians there to teach the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops how to use these devices.

　  美国和蒋贼策划建立联合司令部
    新华社二十五日讯　华盛顿消息：据华盛顿“明星报”二十四日刊载它的驻台北记者的报道，在美国第七舰队司令普赖德指导下的台湾联络中心的建立，已经为成立美蒋联合司令部打下了基础。一旦发生战争，这个联络中心就将成为美蒋联合司令部。拟议中的美蒋联合司令部，除了统率第七舰队以外，还将统率美国的空军单位和蒋贼陆海空军部队。
    “明星报”说，当美国最初想成立美蒋联合司令部的时候，它发现台湾的通讯设备极其不足，不能满足任何美国司令官的需要。因此，美国就把大量的无线电和其他电讯设备运往台湾和某些外围岛屿去。美国还派遣技术人员到那边去教蒋贼军如何使用这些设备。
