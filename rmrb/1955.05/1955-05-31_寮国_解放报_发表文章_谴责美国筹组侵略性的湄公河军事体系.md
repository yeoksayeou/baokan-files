　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 30th: According to a Vietnam News Agency report on the 29th, "Liberation News," the organ of the Laotian Free National United Front, recently published an article condemning the United States for intensifying its activities in an attempt to establish a military system along the Mekong River on the borders of Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos.
　　The article stated that the Thai government has already indicated its willingness to send troops to Laos at any time in the event of an emergency. Furthermore, it is hastily planning to build a railway line connecting the interior with Long Nge (a city on the banks of the Mekong River opposite Vientiane).
　　In Cambodia, the United States and the Royal Cambodian Government have signed a military treaty.
　　As for Laos, under pressure from the United States, the Royal Laotian Government is provoking the assembly areas of the Laotian fighting forces, disrupting political conferences, and plotting to obstruct free general elections in Laos. The Royal Laotian Government has also allowed senior Thai military officers to enter Laos to investigate and photograph Laotian military strongholds in Luang Prabang, Xieng Khouang, and Champasak.
　　The newspaper emphasized that the military system planned to be established on the borders of Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos would in practice be used as a springboard for invading Laos. "Liberation News" believes that once American imperialism realizes its plan, they will establish military bases on Laotian soil, directly threatening Vietnam and China. In this situation, Laos will become a hotbed of war.
　　The newspaper concluded by saying that the Laotian people resolutely oppose the American imperialists and their lackeys who are attempting to establish an aggressive military system on the borders of Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos.
　　The Laotian people demand that the Royal Laotian Government resolutely avoid the American trap and reopen negotiations with the Laotian side based on the principles of sincerity, equality, mutual reconciliation, and mutual respect, in order to achieve free general elections, guarantee national peace and independence, and bring happiness to the people.

　　寮国“解放报”发表文章
　  谴责美国筹组侵略性的湄公河军事体系
    新华社河内三十日电　据越南通讯社二十九日讯：寮国自由民族统一战线机关报“解放报”最近发表了一篇文章，谴责美国最近加紧活动，企图沿湄公河在泰国、柬埔寨和老挝边界建立一个军事体系。
    文章说，泰国政府已经表示它准备在发生万一的时候随时派军队到老挝去。此外，它正在赶忙筹划修筑一条联接内地和龙盖（万象对面湄公河岸上的一个城市）的铁路线。
    在柬埔寨，美国和柬埔寨王国政府已经签订了一项军事条约。
    至于在老挝，老挝王国政府在美国的压力下对寮国战斗部队的集结区进行挑衅，破坏政治会议，并阴谋阻挠老挝的自由普选。老挝王国政府还让泰国的高级军官进入老挝来调查和拍摄在琅勃剌邦、川圹和詹巴萨克的老挝军事据点的情况。
    报纸着重指出：计划在泰国、柬埔寨和老挝边境建立的军事体系将实际上用来作为侵入老挝的跳板。“解放报”认为，一旦美帝国主义实现它的计划，他们将在老挝的土地上建立军事基地，直接威胁越南和中国。在这种情况下，老挝将成为战争的温床。
    报纸最后说：老挝人民坚决反对企图在泰国、柬埔寨、老挝边境建立侵略性军事体系的美帝国主义者和他们的仆从们。
    老挝人民要求老挝王国政府坚决地避开美国的圈套，并根据诚恳、平等、相互和解和互相尊重的原则同寮国方面重开谈判，从而来实现自由普选，保证国家的和平和独立并给人民带来幸福。
