    The West Liao River basin is the granary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Corn, soybeans, and sorghum are planted on ten million mu of fertile black soil. The autonomous region's first tractor station—the Qianjiadian Agricultural Machine Tractor Station—was established here.
    I visited this tractor station in April. This was the first spring plowing and sowing since the station was established. This year, the tractor station will sow more than 2,000 mu of crops for the nearby four agricultural producers' cooperatives, including the "Red Star" cooperative. The entire process from sowing to harvest will be mechanized continuous operation. In addition, it will also help a Korean farmers' production cooperative in the Left Wing Rear Banner of Horqin to do spring plowing.
    The machine耕team leader, Bagenna, led me to visit the agricultural machines parked in the square. Now the station has six tractors of various types, as well as various farm implements such as seeders, threshers, five-铧plows, and rollers, and cultivators have recently been shipped in. A new self-propelled combine harvester has been sent to Harbin to be picked up.
    There are Mongolian station chiefs, machine耕team leaders, and tractor drivers here. The station chief, Gang Garmuren, used to be a banner chief, banner party secretary, and worked in the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the Autonomous Region People's Government. When he accepted the task of establishing a tractor station, he began to study this business. Now he has learned a lot of specialized knowledge about tractor stations and handles the work in the station smoothly every day. Sometimes he also receives representatives of nearby farmers, and often goes to the agricultural production cooperatives he serves. The machine耕team leader is a Mongolian youth who learned to drive a tractor very early. Sarin, Inner Mongolia's first female tractor driver, also works in the machine耕team of this station. At the tractor station, I also met two Mongolian college students—Ulan Bala and Bairi Qing. In the past, they were classmates at Northeast Agricultural College, and now they are jointly responsible for training drivers. The first batch of trained tractor drivers has already taken up their posts, and preparations are now underway to start the second phase. Ulan Bala told me that more than 100 young people have applied to take the entrance examination for the second phase.
    The tractor station has signed cultivation contracts with nearby agricultural production cooperatives. The tractor station helps agricultural production cooperatives improve farming techniques and increase crop yields. Agricultural technicians from the station are also often stationed in cooperatives to provide technical guidance. The station has also trained a group of farm implement operators for the four cooperatives.
    The deputy station chief and I talked about the station's development prospects: by 1957, the tractor station will cultivate and sow for more agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the area served by machine cultivation will reach more than 45,000 mu.

### 西辽河畔的农业机器站

　　西辽河畔的农业机器站
　　新华社记者　本复
    西辽河畔是内蒙古自治区的谷仓。在一千万亩肥沃的黑色土地上种着玉米、大豆和高粱。自治区的第一个拖拉机站——钱家店农业机器拖拉机站就建立在这里。
    四月间，我访问了这个拖拉机站。这时正是拖拉机站建站后第一次春耕播种的日子。今年，拖拉机站要替附近的“红星”等四个农业生产合作社播种两千多亩作物。从播种到收获，将全部进行机械连续作业。此外，还要帮助科尔沁左翼后旗的一个朝鲜族农民的生产合作社进行春翻。
    机耕队长巴根那领着我参观了停在广场上的农业机器。现在站里已有各式拖拉机六台，还有播种机、脱谷机、五铧犁、镇压器等各种农具，最近又运来了中耕机。一台新的自动推进联合收割机已去哈尔滨接运。
    这里有蒙族的站长、机耕队长和拖拉机手。站长钢嘎木仁曾经做过旗长、旗委书记，并在自治区人民政府农牧部工作过。当他接受了建立拖拉机站的任务时，就开始钻研这门业务。现在他已懂得了许多拖拉机站的专门知识，每天顺利地处理着站里的工作。有时还要接待附近的农民代表，常常到他们服务的农业生产合作社去。机耕队长是一个蒙族青年，他很早就学开拖拉机了。内蒙古第一个女拖拉机手萨仁也在这个站的机耕队里工作。在拖拉机站里，我还遇见了两个蒙族大学生——乌兰巴拉和白日清，过去，他们是东北农学院的同学，现在一起担负训练驾驶员的任务。第一批训练出来的拖拉机手，已走上工作岗位，现在正筹备开办第二期。乌兰巴拉告诉我，已有一百多名青年申请参加第二期的入学考试。
    拖拉机站和附近的农业生产合作社签订了耕作合同。拖拉机站帮助农业生产合作社改进耕作技术，提高作物产量。站里的农业技术员还经常驻在合作社里，进行技术指导。站里还替四个合作社训练了一批农具手。
    副站长和我谈到这个站的发展远景：到一九五七年拖拉机站将为更多的农业生产合作社代耕播种，服务的机耕面积将达到四万五千多亩。
