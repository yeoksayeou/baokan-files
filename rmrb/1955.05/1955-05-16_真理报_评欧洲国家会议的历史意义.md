Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on the 15th, commenting on the achievements of the Warsaw Conference of European States on Ensuring Peace and Security in Europe.

The "Pravda" editorial emphasized that the historical significance of this conference lies in: it further strengthened the forces of free nations united in the struggle for peace, and took a major step forward in the cause of consolidating European security. The achievements of the Warsaw Conference are of extremely important significance because the adoption of new measures to ensure peace and security in Europe is taking place at a time of heightened danger, a danger arising from the revival of German militarism after the ratification of the Paris Accords.

Referring to the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed by the participating countries of the Warsaw Conference, the editorial pointed out the treaty's peaceful nature. The editorial said that the principle of peaceful coexistence among countries, announced by the great Lenin, is the unshakable foundation of the peaceful foreign policy of the democratic camp. Unlike the exclusive military blocs established by imperialist countries, the Eight-Nation Treaty is open to the accession of other countries (regardless of their social and state systems). This characteristic of the Eight-Nation Treaty also proves its defensive nature and the defensive nature of the organization established according to it. The editorial also pointed out the important significance of the speech made by Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China at the Warsaw Conference. The editorial said that the Government of the People's Republic of China and the 600 million Chinese people are in complete agreement with the eight contracting countries and fully support the treaty. Peace and security in Asia are inseparable from peace and security in Europe. The interests of the great People's Republic of China are inseparable from the interests of peace-loving countries in Europe.

　　“真理报”评欧洲国家会议的历史意义
    据新华社讯  苏联“真理报”十五日发表社论，评论欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全的华沙会议的成就。
    “真理报”的社论着重指出，这次会议的历史意义在于：它更加紧密地团结了自由国家的力量为争取和平而斗争，在巩固欧洲安全的事业上前进了一大步。华沙会议的成就所以具有极其重要的意义，是因为保障欧洲和平和安全的新措施的采取正是在危险加剧的时候，这种危险是由于巴黎协定批准后德国军国主义的复活而产生的。
    社论在谈到华沙会议参加国所签订的友好合作互助条约时，指出了条约的和平性质。社论说，伟大的列宁所宣布的各国和平共处的原则，是民主阵营各国和平外交政策的不可动摇的基础。和帝国主义国家建立的排他性军事集团不同，八国条约对其他国家（不问它们的社会和国家制度如何）的加入是开着大门的。八国条约的这一特征也证明了它的防御性质以及根据它而建立的那个组织的防御性质。社论同时指出了中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀在华沙会议上代表中华人民共和国政府所作的发言的重要意义。社论说，中华人民共和国政府和六亿中国人民跟八个缔约国是完全一致的，并且完全支持这个条约。亚洲的和平和安全同欧洲的和平和安全是分不开的。伟大的中华人民共和国的利益同欧洲爱好和平的国家的利益是不可分的。
