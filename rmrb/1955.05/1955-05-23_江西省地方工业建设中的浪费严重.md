Uphold Thrift, Oppose Waste in Capital Construction!
Serious Waste in Local Industrial Construction in Jiangxi Province
Hou Bingheng, Chief of the Capital Construction Section of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry

    Waste is a serious problem in the capital construction work of state-owned local industries in Jiangxi Province.

    The newly built Huagushan Coal Mine, due to a lack of serious investigation of geological conditions beforehand, was staffed with cadres and construction began. Drilling and construction proceeded simultaneously. Ultimately, due to the disordered coal seams, construction was forced to stop in 1953, resulting in the accumulation and waste of 462,000 yuan.

    The Tianhe Iron Smelting Plant was also shut down due to a failure to fully grasp various economic and technical data. The excessive sulfur content of the coke could not be processed, resulting in the accumulation and waste of 420,200 yuan.

    A complete set of spinning machines for the Jiangxi Gunny Sack Factory has been purchased from abroad. However, due to the national balance of supply and demand for gunny sacks, there is no current need for new construction, so the construction date has been postponed, resulting in the accumulation of over 1.4 million yuan.

    Economic leadership organs blindly formulate plans on the one hand, and on the other hand, are not strict in reviewing the designs of construction units. The Jiangxi Paper Mill originally planned to develop into a paper mill with a daily output of 20 tons by 1955, and many of the equipment and buildings were planned according to this scale. However, according to national needs, this factory should not be developed to such a large size. Due to the leadership organs hastily approving this design, a set of ten-ton paper machines worth 400,000 yuan has been sitting in the warehouse for several years without being used. Another example is the preliminary design and technical design of the Zhongjiashan Coal Mine's auxiliary power plant. Because the Department of Industry did not fully understand the power consumption of the mine, and the designers were unsure of their work, the design was changed four times, and the budget was repeatedly increased. As a result, an additional set of 120-kilowatt generating equipment was installed, wasting 185,100 yuan.

    Some construction units, lacking organization and discipline, arbitrarily modify state plans and expand non-productive buildings, also causing significant waste. Last year, when the Jiangxi Machinery Factory carried out expansion work, the originally estimated unit prices of labor and materials were, in many cases, too high. However, the factory's leading staff and engineers believed that the remaining money during construction was "savings." They repeatedly violated discipline, increasing the non-productive building area by 1,853 square meters, reducing the factory building area by 687 square meters, and increasing the unplanned civil engineering works by 11 percent. Originally, the office building, auditorium, and gate could have been avoided, but they were built very luxuriously. Conversely, the forging and foundry workshops were built very small, and the equipment could not be installed, wasting nearly 100,000 yuan.

    Some technical personnel lack a sense of responsibility for design and construction and cannot work with the attitude of masters, which also leads to serious waste. For example, the construction of the Tianhe Coal Mine's auxiliary power plant failed due to the dereliction of duty by technical personnel, resulting in two generating sets with a total capacity of 820 kVA being only able to output 200 kW, and frequent power outages. Less than two years after completion, it is now necessary to invest another 197,000 yuan for renovation. Another example is the cooling project carried out by the Xinsheng Textile Factory in 1953. Because the designers neither designed nor made a budget, they blindly started construction. After completion, it had no effect at all, wasting 19,000 yuan of state funds. Some technical personnel also have the erroneous idea of ​​greed and ambition in their work, "more is always better than less." The Zhangshu Power Plant has only two users nearby, the rice processing factory and the station, but the designers casually ordered ten transformers and more than ten kilometers of line materials. As a result, seven transformers of various specifications, ten tons of copper wire, five hundred poles, and seven tons of iron parts were stockpiled. These four items alone are worth more than 160,000 yuan, accounting for 23 percent of the plant's total investment.

    Because many staff members of basic construction units have extravagant and wasteful ideas that disregard the country's economic conditions, they increase the cost of non-productive buildings such as dormitories. Some units' living facilities are divorced from the masses. For example, the office building of the Jiangxi Textile Factory has a layer of wooden flooring added on top of the cement floor, and the cost per square meter is as high as more than 140 yuan, which is half more expensive than the current average office building construction cost in Jiangxi Province.

    The relevant leading organs of Jiangxi Province should quickly strengthen the leadership of capital construction work and attach importance to the work of thrift in capital construction, and mobilize all employees to launch a struggle against waste. Only in this way can we rationally and economically use national construction investment and concentrate our efforts on building heavy industry.

### 江西省地方工业建设中的浪费严重

　　厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！
　　江西省地方工业建设中的浪费严重
　　江西省工业厅基本建设科科长　侯秉衡
    在江西省地方国营工业的基本建设工作中，浪费现象是严重的。
    新建的花鼓山煤矿，因为事前没有认真调查地质情况，就配齐干部，破土开工，一边钻探，一边建筑，终因煤层凌乱，在一九五三年被迫停建，积压和浪费了四十六万二千元。
    天河炼铁厂也因为没有充分掌握各种经济技术资料，终因焦炭含硫过多，没法处理而停建，积压和浪费了四十二万零二百元。
    江西麻袋厂的整套纺机已由国外购来，但因全国麻袋供销平衡，目前不需要新建，只好推迟建设日期，积压了一百四十余万元。
    经济领导机关一方面盲目制定计划，另方面对建设单位的设计审查也很不严格。江西造纸厂原拟到一九五五年时发展成为日产二十吨的纸厂，很多设备和建筑都是按照这样的规模计划的。但是，根据国家需要，这个厂不应该发展得这样大。由于领导机关草率地批准了这个设计，以致一套价值四十万元的十吨抄纸机在仓库里放了几年不能使用。再如钟家山煤矿附属电厂的初步设计和技术设计，由于工业厅不十分了解矿山用电情况和设计人员心中无数，前后变更四次，一再追加预算，结果多装了一套一百二十瓩的发电设备，浪费了十八万五千一百元。
    某些建设单位无组织、无纪律，擅自修改国家计划，随意扩大非生产建筑，也造成很大的浪费。去年，江西机械厂进行扩建工程时，原估计的工料单价有很多是过高的。但是，厂的领导工作人员和工程师反认为施工中余下的钱是“节约”的，一而再地违犯纪律，增加非生产建筑面积一千八百五十三平方公尺、减少厂房面积六百八十七平方公尺，共增加了计划外的土建工程百分之十一。本来，办公楼、礼堂、大门是可以不建的，结果建筑得非常华丽。相反地，却把锻工间、翻砂间建筑得很矮小，设备安装不下，浪费了近十万元。
    有些技术人员对设计和施工缺乏责任感，不能以主人翁的态度进行工作，也造成了严重的浪费。例如天河煤矿附属发电厂的建设，就是因为技术人员失职，使两部共八百二十千伏安的发电设备只能输出电力二百瓩，而且经常停电。建成后不到两年，现在又不得不再投资十九万七千元进行改造。又如新甡纺织厂在一九五三年施工的降温工程，由于设计人员既不设计又不造预算，便盲目开工，建成后一点不起作用，浪费了国家资金一万九千元。有些技术人员在工作中还有贪多贪大、“多了总比少了强”的错误思想。樟树电厂的用户只有附近的加工米厂和车站两家，但设计人员却随便订购了十只变压器和十几公里的线路器材，因此，积压了七只各种规格的变压器、十吨铜线、五百根电杆和七吨铁件，仅这四项物资就价值十六万余元，占该厂总投资额的百分之二十三。
    由于很多基本建设单位的工作人员存在不顾国家经济条件的铺张浪费思想，把宿舍等非生产建筑的造价提高，有的单位建筑的生活设施，脱离群众。例如江西纺织厂的办公大楼，在水泥地面上再加一层木地板，每平方公尺造价高达一百四十余元，比江西省目前中等的办公楼建筑费贵一半。
    江西省有关领导机关，应该迅速加强对基本建设工作的领导和重视基本建设中的节约工作，动员全体职工向浪费现象展开斗争。只有这样，才能合理地、节约地使用国家建设投资，集中力量建设重工业。
