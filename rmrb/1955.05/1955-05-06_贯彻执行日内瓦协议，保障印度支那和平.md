Implement the Geneva Accords and Guarantee Peace in Indochina
　　Yan Jihong
    The first and second reports of the Vietnam International Commission, the first report of the Laos International Commission, and the first report of the Cambodia International Commission were published on May 3rd. These reports show that during the period from July 1954 to the end of 1954 or the beginning of 1955, some provisions of the Geneva Accords have been implemented. These reports basically reflect the consistent and faithful implementation of the Geneva Accords by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Army, the Lao fighting forces, and the Khmer resistance forces. They also point out the acts of France and the Ngo Dinh Diem government in violating the Geneva Accords, as well as the Lao Kingdom Government and the Cambodian Kingdom Government's violations or lack of effective implementation of certain provisions of the Geneva Accords.

    From these reports and the recent developments in the Indochina situation, it can be seen that there are still many problems in implementing the Geneva Accords. The main ones are: in Vietnam, the US aggressive bloc, under the direction of the Ngo Dinh Diem government, is conspiring to obstruct and undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords regarding the provisions for holding democratic general elections in Vietnam. The Ngo Dinh Diem government is also carrying out political persecution against the people of South Vietnam and coercing and enticing civilians from North Vietnam to move south on a large scale; in Laos, the Lao fighting forces in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly are constantly under attack, and a political solution has not yet been reached; in Cambodia, the Kingdom Government has not effectively implemented the relevant political provisions of the Geneva Accords, so that former Khmer resistance personnel have not been able to obtain the guarantees of their due rights and freedoms, and all Cambodian citizens cannot unite in common life. In addition, the US aggressive bloc is also trying in every possible way to undermine the Geneva Accords, drag South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into military alliances, and establish military bases in these three countries.

    According to the Geneva Accords, Vietnam should conduct democratic general elections under the supervision of the Vietnam International Commission within July 1956, and from July 20, 1955, the representative responsible authorities of both regions of Vietnam should consult on this issue. However, the US aggressive bloc and the Ngo Dinh Diem government fear this election and do not want Vietnam to be democratically unified, because they know very well that the democratic general elections of the Vietnamese people will never choose any government that obeys foreign forces to persecute and enslave the people. They want to divide Vietnam for a long time and maintain their rule in South Vietnam, so as to turn South Vietnam into a military base for the US aggressive bloc to wage war and to create and maintain tension in Indochina. In recent months, this conspiracy of the US aggressive bloc and the Ngo Dinh Diem government has become very obvious.

    Collins, the US special envoy to South Vietnam, openly clamored in a press conference held in Saigon after taking office last November, falsely accusing that "holding free elections in the area controlled by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is inconceivable." On March 8 this year, US Secretary of State Dulles also clamored in a speech, falsely accusing that "it would be difficult to create conditions in the north that would allow people to have real elections." Collins also proposed in February this year the so-called UN-supervised election argument, which is inconsistent with the Geneva Accords. Ngo Dinh Diem then chimed in, insisting that the Vietnam International Commission could not supervise the general election, but should be supervised by the United Nations. The way the US aggressive bloc and Ngo Dinh Diem sing the same tune is entirely to find various excuses to oppose holding general elections in Vietnam and to obstruct the realization of democratic unification.

    Everyone knows that the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are living a life of true democracy and freedom, and the so-called difficulty in having freedom of election in North Vietnam is completely inconsistent with the facts. On the contrary, as pointed out in the report of the Vietnam International Commission, the Vietnam International Commission has come to the same conclusion in several investigations: it is the Ngo Dinh Diem government that is violating the Geneva Accords, carrying out political persecution, and trampling on the people's democratic freedom. Moreover, because the Vietnamese people have not yet been able to live freely under a unified and democratic government today, it is even more necessary to hold democratic and free elections throughout Vietnam as scheduled in accordance with the Geneva Accords. As for the supervision of the election, the Geneva Accords clearly stipulate that the Vietnam International Commission, which supervises the ceasefire, is responsible for it. Any argument that attempts to overthrow this provision is just to create excuses for undermining the agreement and obstructing the election, and is completely untenable.

    Regarding the freedom of movement of Vietnamese civilians, Article 14(d) of the Vietnam Cessation of Hostilities Agreement stipulates that civilians in the area controlled by one party who move to the area controlled by the other party should be entirely voluntary, but the period for relocation must end before May 18, 1955. After the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced to the people that anyone who voluntarily went to South Vietnam could freely move there. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam also tried its best to provide them with transportation facilities for relocation under extremely difficult conditions. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem government and the French military authorities in North Vietnam at that time have been inducing on a large scale and even using violence to force civilians from North Vietnam to move south since the ceasefire. The Vietnam International Commission mentioned in its report that it had received many accusations from North Vietnamese residents against the Ngo Dinh Diem government and the French military authorities for such violations of the agreement. The Vietnam International Commission has conducted investigations into such facts and requested explanations from the French side. This is the actual situation in North Vietnam. In South Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem government itself is using various coercive means to prevent South Vietnamese residents who voluntarily move north from moving freely. A team from the Vietnam International Commission has exposed this situation. All these facts show that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is faithfully implementing the provisions of the Geneva Accords, while the Ngo Dinh Diem government and the French military authorities in Vietnam are openly violating Article 14(d) of the Vietnam Ceasefire Agreement. Recently, the Ngo Dinh Diem government even requested to change the provisions of the Vietnam Ceasefire Agreement and extend the deadline for civilian relocation, so that they can continue to induce North Vietnamese civilians to move south after May 18. The Ngo Dinh Diem government even openly threatened that if the deadline for civilian relocation is not extended, it will refuse to hold a democratic general election in all of Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Accords. This fully exposes the vicious conspiracy of the US aggressive bloc and its followers to further undermine the Geneva Accords.

    In Laos, the violation of the Geneva Accords by armed attacks on the Lao fighting forces in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly has not stopped, and these two provinces are clearly designated as assembly areas for the Lao fighting forces in the ceasefire agreement. The report of the Laos International Commission also pointed out that France and the Lao Kingdom Government air-dropped personnel and materials in the area, attacked the Lao fighting forces, and plundered the peaceful residents of the two provinces in violation of the agreement. On the other hand, the political conference between the two parties in Laos to discuss a political solution has been intermittent and has recently been shelved again. The serious situation that the Laos International Commission is very concerned about in its report has not eased so far. Obviously, the United States is most pleased with this tension. When the relevant parties were consulting in the political conference, Dulles made a speech on March 8, attempting to incite this conflict and trying to intervene. He said that due to the protection of the "Southeast Asia Defense Group," the Lao Kingdom Government could let go of "suppressing" the Lao fighting forces. A high degree of vigilance must be maintained against this argument of the war-mongering conspirator Dulles.

    The US aggressive bloc's conspiracy against Laos is not limited to this. The remnants of the Kuomintang, supported logistically by the US aggressive bloc and directed militarily by it, infiltrated Laos in multiple groups after the ceasefire, attacked the Lao fighting forces, created conflicts, gathered on the border between China, Burma, and Laos, established bases, and roamed around to attack. This not only infringed upon the sovereignty of Laos and undermined the ceasefire in Laos, but also threatened the security of China and Burma at the same time. This is an extremely serious aspect that we must pay special attention to when understanding the Indochina situation.

    In Cambodia, as pointed out in the report of the Cambodia International Commission, the Kingdom Government has not taken effective measures to unite all Cambodian citizens in a common life in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, and former Khmer resistance personnel are still subjected to discrimination and arrest. The Kingdom Government issued an amnesty decree under the urging of the International Commission, but the scope is still not wide enough. The International Commission also expressed dissatisfaction with this and raised objections. In February this year, the Kingdom Government also proposed a so-called draft election law reform, attempting to deprive some Cambodian people, including former Khmer resistance personnel, of their right to vote. This is clearly not in line with the Geneva Accords. It should be pointed out that the provisions on political issues in Cambodia are an integral and important part of the Geneva Accords. As pointed out by the International Commission, the Kingdom Government's failure to seriously implement this main provision is a top priority and serious problem in Cambodia today, which must be resolved satisfactorily.

    In order to implement Dulles's aggressive war plan to encircle and attack the People's Republic of China from the three fronts of Korea, Taiwan, and Indochina, the US aggressive bloc not only directed the remnants of the Kuomintang to invade Laos and establish bases on the Sino-Burmese border, but also attempted to drag South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into the Southeast Asia military group. Last September, the US aggressive bloc arbitrarily included South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into the so-called protection area of ​​the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty." In South Vietnam, the US aggressive bloc has begun to openly violate the provisions of the Geneva Accords prohibiting foreign military assistance and is arming the troops of the Ngo Dinh Diem government. Recently, Dulles also personally went to Laos and Cambodia to plan the signing of bilateral military assistance agreements between the United States and these two countries, attempting to seize the right to train the troops of these two countries. There are various signs that the US aggressive bloc, which has always been hostile to the Geneva Accords and deliberately undermined peace in Indochina, is still carrying out conspiracies in many ways to organize South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into its war preparation plan. It is the most ferocious enemy of implementing the Geneva Accords and guaranteeing peace in Indochina.

    The above-mentioned problems that exist in Indochina today reflect the serious situation in Indochina. It is very clear that the only way to solve this serious situation is to resolutely implement all aspects of the Geneva Accords. Specifically: The democratic general elections in Laos and Cambodia stipulated in the Geneva Accords for 1955 must be held as scheduled. The democratic general elections throughout Vietnam stipulated in the Geneva Accords for July 1956 must be held as scheduled under the supervision of the Vietnam International Commission in accordance with the agreement. The representative responsible authorities of both regions of Vietnam must start consultations on the issue of the general election throughout Vietnam from July 20 this year. The Ngo Dinh Diem government in South Vietnam must stop the illegal acts of inducing and coercing civilians from North Vietnam to move south, and stop the political persecution of the people of South Vietnam and other violations of democratic rights. The armed attacks on the Lao fighting forces in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly in Laos must be stopped. Political consultations in Laos should be resumed as soon as possible, and an agreement should be reached on the current main issues. The Cambodian Kingdom Government must take effective measures to protect the rights and freedoms of all Cambodian citizens. Only when the countries of Indochina strictly abide by and implement the Geneva Accords, and the countries of the Geneva Conference abide by the agreement, implement the agreement, and maintain the implementation of the agreement with a serious and responsible attitude, can lasting peace be achieved in Indochina.

    On February 14 this year, the King of Laos announced in a speech to the parliament that the Lao Kingdom Government "now intends to clearly and completely fulfill" the Geneva Accords, and expressed support for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. On April 23 this year, Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Kat Sasorith agreed with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong in Vientiane to handle relations between the two countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In the joint communiqué issued after the meeting between the head of the Cambodian delegation visiting India, Sihanouk, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru on March 18 this year, the Cambodian and Indian governments "unanimously believe that the Geneva Accords should be fully implemented" and jointly support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. These expressions are good, welcome, and fully in line with the interests of the Geneva Accords and peace in Indochina. We hope that words and actions are consistent, and we hope that the Lao Kingdom Government and the Cambodian Kingdom Government will earnestly and faithfully implement all the agreements of the Geneva Conference that they signed and promised, so that those problems related to the implementation of the Geneva Accords that currently exist in Laos and Cambodia will be resolved in a timely manner.

    The three international committees in Indochina have played an active role in supervising the implementation of the ceasefire in Indochina. We hope that the Vietnam International Commission, the Laos International Commission, and the Cambodia International Commission will recognize that they are facing the current serious and complex Indochina situation, fairly and resolutely complete their tasks, and supervise the implementation of the Geneva Accords.

    For the sake of peace in Indochina, we must be highly vigilant and carry out a resolute struggle against those US aggressive blocs and their followers who pursue war and deliberately undermine the Geneva Accords, and never allow their conspiracy to succeed. Today, the conspiracy of the US aggressive bloc and its followers to undermine the Geneva Accords is an attempt to turn the countries of Indochina into battlefields, and to have the people of Indochina serve as cannon fodder in the imperialist aggressive war of "Asians fighting Asians." This directly endangers the security and interests of every Indochinese person. This vicious conspiracy of the US aggressive bloc is being met with angry condemnation and resolute resistance from the people of Indochina and Asia. In fact, the US aggressive bloc's conspiracy activities in Indochina today not only harm the interests of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, infringe on their sovereignty, and attempt to destroy the independence of their countries, but also seize territory for the US's world hegemony and squeeze out France. The recent developments in the situation in South Vietnam have further exposed the conspiracy and tricks of the US aggressive bloc against Indochina.

    In order to implement the Geneva Accords to ensure peace in Indochina, it is necessary to be vigilant against the US's aggressive actions to undermine the Geneva Accords and launch a resolute struggle.

　　贯彻执行日内瓦协议，保障印度支那和平
　　严季洪
    越南国际委员会第一、二次报告，老挝国际委员会第一次报告和柬埔寨国际委员会第一次报告，在五月三日公布了。这些报告表明：在一九五四年七月到一九五四年底或一九五五年初的期间，日内瓦协议的一部分条款已经见诸实施。这些报告基本上反映了越南民主共和国政府和人民军、寮国战斗部队和高棉抗战部队对于日内瓦协议的一贯忠实执行，同时也指出了法国和吴庭艳政府的违反日内瓦协议的行为，以及老挝王国政府和柬埔寨王国政府对于日内瓦协议某些规定的违反或没有切实执行。
    从这些报告和最近印度支那局势的发展中可以看出：当前贯彻执行日内瓦协议还存在着不少的问题。其中主要的是：在越南，美国侵略集团指使吴庭艳政府阴谋阻挠破坏日内瓦协议关于举行越南民主普选规定的实施，以及吴庭艳政府对南越人民实行政治迫害并大规模胁迫和诱骗北越平民南迁；在老挝，桑怒和丰沙里两省的寮国战斗部队不断遭到进攻，政治解决迄未达成；在柬埔寨，王国政府没有切实执行日内瓦协议中的有关的政治性条款，以致前高棉抗战人员尚未能获得其应有的权利和自由的保障，全体柬埔寨公民尚不能团结在共同生活中。此外，美国侵略集团还在千方百计地企图破坏日内瓦协议，把南越、老挝和柬埔寨拉进军事联盟，并在这三个国家建立军事基地。
    按照日内瓦协议，越南应在一九五六年七月内在越南国际委员会的监督下进行民主普选，而自一九五五年七月二十日起，越南双方地区有代表性的负责当局即应就此项问题进行协商。但是，美国侵略集团和吴庭艳政府却害怕这个选举，不愿越南民主统一，因为他们知道得很清楚，越南人民的民主普选是决不会选择任何听从外国势力指挥来迫害人民、奴役人民的政府的。他们想长期分裂越南，维持在南越的统治，以便把南越变成美国侵略集团进行战争的军事基地，并在印度支那制造和维持紧张局势。最近几个月来，美国侵略集团和吴庭艳政府的这种阴谋已经十分明显。
    美国驻南越特使柯林斯在去年十一月上任后在西贡举行的一次记者招待会上，就公开叫嚷诬蔑：在越南民主共和国控制地区内“举行自由选举是不可思议的”。今年三月八日，美国国务卿杜勒斯在演说中也叫嚣诬蔑：“要在北部创造可以让人们有真正选举的条件会是困难的”。柯林斯又在今年二月提出与日内瓦协议不符的所谓由联合国监督选举的论调。吴庭艳就接着帮腔，硬说越南国际委员会不能监督普选，而应该由联合国来监督。美国侵略集团和吴庭艳这样一吹一唱的做法，完全是为了要找寻各种借口来反对在越南举行普选，阻碍民主统一的实现。
    人人都知道越南民主共和国人民在过着真正的民主自由的生活，所谓在北越很难有选举自由的说法是完全与事实不符的。恰恰相反，正如越南国际委员会的报告所指出，越南国际委员会曾在好几次调查中得出同样的结论：违反日内瓦协议实行政治迫害、蹂躏人民民主自由的正是吴庭艳政府。而且，因为越南人民今天还没有能够在一个统一民主的政府下自由生活，按照日内瓦协议如期举行全越南民主自由的选举就更加有其必要。至于选举的监督，日内瓦协议明确规定由监督停战的越南国际委员会负责，任何企图推翻这项规定的论调，不过是为破坏协议，阻挠选举制造借口，是完全站不住的。
    关于越南平民迁居的自由，越南停止敌对行动协定第十四条丁款规定，一方控制地区的平民迁往另一方控制地区，应该完全根据自愿，但迁居的期限必须在一九五五年五月十八日以前结束。越南民主共和国在停战协定签订后就公告人民，凡是自愿到南越去的人都可以自由迁去。越南民主共和国并在极其困难的条件下尽力设法为他们提供迁居的交通便利。但是，吴庭艳政府和当时在北越的法军当局却自停战以来就在大规模地诱骗甚至使用暴力强迫北越平民南迁。越南国际委员会在报告中提到它曾经收到许多北越居民对于吴庭艳政府和法军当局这类违反协议行为的控告。对于这类事实，越南国际委员会曾进行过调查，并要求法方解释。这是在北越的实际情况。在南越，吴庭艳政府却自己在用种种强制手段阻挠自愿北迁的南越居民自由迁居。越南国际委员会的小组曾经揭露了这一情况。所有这些事实都表明：越南民主共和国是在忠实执行日内瓦协议的规定，而吴庭艳政府和越南法军当局则公然违反越南停战协定第十四条丁款。最近吴庭艳政府竟要求改变越南停战协定的规定，延长平民迁居期限，以便他们在五月十八日以后仍然能够继续诱骗北越平民南迁。吴庭艳政府甚至公开恐吓说：如果不延长平民迁居的期限，它就将拒绝按照日内瓦协议举行全越南的民主普选。这更充分地暴露了美国侵略集团及其追随者企图更进一步破坏日内瓦协议的恶毒阴谋。
    在老挝，在桑怒和丰沙里两省武装进攻寮国战斗部队的违反日内瓦协议的行为迄未停止，而该两省是停战协定明文规定划作寮国战斗部队的集结区的。老挝国际委员会的报告也指出了法国和老挝王国政府在该地区空投人员物资，进攻寮国战斗部队，抢掠两省和平居民的违反协议行为。另一方面，商谈政治解决的老挝双方政治会议则时断时续，最近又告搁浅。老挝国际委员会在报告中所十分关心的这个严重局势，至今还没有缓和下来。显然，美国对于这种紧张局势是最高兴的。当有关双方正在政治会议中进行磋商的时候，杜勒斯却在三月八日发表演说，企图煽动这种冲突，并企图插足进来。他说：由于有“东南亚防御集团”的保护，老挝王国政府可以放手“镇压”寮国战斗部队。对于战争贩子阴谋家杜勒斯的这种论调必须予以高度的警惕。
    美国侵略集团对老挝的阴谋还不止于此。由美国侵略集团提供后勤支援并在军事上受它指挥的国民党残匪在停战后分成多股侵入老挝，袭击寮国战斗部队，制造冲突，在中国、缅甸和老挝边境集结，建立基地，并到处流窜进攻。这不仅侵犯了老挝的主权，破坏老挝的停战，而且同时还威胁着中、缅两国的安全。这是我们在了解印度支那局势时必须特别注意的极其严重的一面。
    在柬埔寨，正如柬埔寨国际委员会报告中所指出的，王国政府并未依照日内瓦协议的规定，采取有效措施来把全体柬埔寨公民团结在共同生活中，前高棉抗战人员仍遭受歧视并被逮捕。王国政府在国际委员会的督促下才发布了大赦令，但是范围仍不够广泛。国际委员会对此也表示不满，提出异议。今年二月，王国政府还提出所谓选举法改革草案，企图剥夺包括前高棉抗战人员在内的一部分柬埔寨人民的选举权。这显然是不符合于日内瓦协议的。应该指出：关于柬埔寨的政治性条款的规定，是日内瓦协议不可分割的重要部分。正如国际委员会所指出，王国政府对于这项主要规定不能认真执行，是柬埔寨当前的一个头等严重的问题，必须求得一个满意的解决。
    美国侵略集团为了执行杜勒斯所叫嚣的从朝鲜、台湾、印度支那三条战线包围和进攻中华人民共和国的侵略战争计划，不但指使国民党残匪侵入老挝，在中缅边境建立基地，而且还企图把南越、老挝和柬埔寨一起拉进东南亚军事集团。去年九月，美国侵略集团竟擅自把南越、老挝和柬埔寨划进了“东南亚集体防务条约”的所谓保护地区。在南越，美国侵略集团并已开始公然违反日内瓦协议禁止外国军事援助的规定，进行武装吴庭艳政府的军队。最近，杜勒斯还亲自前往老挝和柬埔寨，策划签订美国同这两个国家的双边军事援助协定，企图攫取这两个国家的军队训练权。有种种的迹象可以看出：一贯敌视日内瓦协议，蓄意破坏印度支那和平的美国侵略集团力图把南越、老挝和柬埔寨一起组织进它的准备战争计划里去的阴谋仍在多方面进行。它是贯彻日内瓦协议、保障印度支那和平的最凶恶的敌人。
    今天存在于印度支那的上述问题所反映出的印度支那的局势是严重的。很清楚，要解决这个严重的局势只有坚决贯彻日内瓦协议的全部实施。具体来说：日内瓦协议所规定的一九五五年内老挝和柬埔寨的民主普选必须如期举行。日内瓦协议所规定的一九五六年七月内的全越南民主普选，必须依照协议如期在越南国际委员会监督下举行。越南双方地区有代表性的负责当局必须自今年七月二十日起就全越南普选问题开始进行协商。南越吴庭艳政府必须停止诱骗和胁迫北越平民南迁的非法行为，并停止对南越人民的政治迫害和其它民主权利的侵犯。在老挝的桑怒和丰沙里两省对于寮国战斗部队的武装进攻必须停止。老挝的政治协商应该早日恢复，并就当前的主要问题达成协议。柬埔寨王国政府必须采取有效措施来保障柬埔寨全体公民的权利和自由。只有印度支那各国严格遵守和执行日内瓦协议，日内瓦会议各国以严肃负责的态度遵守协议、贯彻协议并维护协议的贯彻，才能实现在印度支那的持久和平。
    今年二月十四日，老挝国王在议会的演说中宣布：老挝王国政府“现在打算明确地、完全地履行”日内瓦协议，并表示对于和平共处五项原则的支持。今年四月二十三日，老挝王国首相克特·萨索里斯在万隆同越南民主共和国副总理兼外交部长范文同协议根据和平共处五项原则来处理两国之间的关系。在今年三月十八日柬埔寨访问印度的代表团团长西哈努克同印度总理尼赫鲁会谈后的联合公报中，柬埔寨和印度两国政府“一致认为：日内瓦协议应该充分执行”，并共同支持和平共处五项原则。这些表示是好的，值得欢迎的，是完全符合于日内瓦协议和印度支那和平的利益的。我们希望，言论与行动一致，我们希望，老挝王国政府和柬埔寨王国政府将认真地、忠实地实施它们所签署承诺的日内瓦会议的全部协议，从而使目前存在于老挝和柬埔寨两国的有关贯彻日内瓦协议的那些问题，会及时得到解决。
    印度支那三个国际委员会在监督印度支那停战实施方面曾经起了积极的作用。我们希望，越南国际委员会、老挝国际委员会和柬埔寨国际委员会将认识到它们正面对着当前严重而复杂的印度支那局势，公正地、坚决地完成它们的任务，监督日内瓦协议的贯彻执行。
    为了印度支那的和平，对于那些追求战争，蓄意破坏日内瓦协议的美国侵略集团及其追随者，我们必须提高警惕，进行坚决的斗争，决不容许他们的阴谋得逞。今天美国侵略集团及其追随者破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋是企图把印度支那各国变成战场，要印度支那各国人民在帝国主义的“以亚洲人打亚洲人”的侵略战争中充当炮灰。这是直接危害每一个印度支那人民的安全和利益的。美国侵略集团的这种恶毒的阴谋正遭到印度支那和亚洲人民的愤怒的谴责和坚决的反抗。事实上，美国侵略集团今天在印度支那的阴谋活动不仅在危害越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民的利益，侵犯他们的主权，并企图摧毁他们国家的独立，而且也在为美国的世界霸权抢夺地盘，排挤法国。最近南越局势的发展更加暴露了美国侵略集团对印度支那的阴谋诡计。
    为贯彻实施日内瓦协议以保障印度支那的和平，必须对于美国破坏日内瓦协议的侵略行为提高警惕，并展开坚决的斗争。
