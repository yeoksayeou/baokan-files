　　Surveying the Wasteland of the Junggar Basin
　　By our reporter Shen Shi
    The boundless Junggar Basin has vast stretches of wasteland waiting for people to reclaim them. This wasteland is overgrown with red willows, reeds, and drought-resistant plants, and can be turned into fertile fields with irrigation.
    Members of the Northwest Wasteland Survey and Design Team are currently surveying 150,000 mu of wasteland on the west bank of the Manas River in the basin. This piece of wasteland is planned to be reclaimed this year by a certain production and construction corps. The newly built large canal will transport water from the Daquangou Reservoir and the Manas River to irrigate the farm that is about to appear here.
    In 1954, members of the Wasteland Survey and Design Team surveyed 900,000 mu of wasteland on both banks of the Yellow River at the foot of the Helan Mountains. In March of this year, they came to Xinjiang again, and entered the construction site on the west bank of the Manas River in early April. In this water-scarce area, the cooks drive horse-drawn carts to transport water back from a long distance. Just as the sky begins to brighten, the team members leave the camp and do not finish work until dark. In this way, they can measure more than 3,000 mu of wasteland every day. In the dry, low-lying areas overgrown with reeds, they can only measure more than 1,000 mu per day while cutting reeds. Many team members' hands have been cut by the reeds. Female surveyors Da Fengqin, Zhang Zhifang, Jiang Huilan and others are carrying out arduous work like their male comrades. Also working with them in this area are the Xinjiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and the Xinjiang Military Region's survey team, who are engaged in the layout of farm channels.
    By the end of May, they will have completed the survey here and move to a new construction site. This autumn, tractor fleets will plow this virgin land that has never been reclaimed before, and tractors pulling seeders will sow winter wheat seeds. At this time next year, a green wheat sea will set off beautiful rolling wheat waves.

　　准噶尔盆地的荒地在勘测中
　　本报记者　沈石
    一望无边的准噶尔盆地，有着大片的荒地等待人们前往开垦。这些荒地丛生着红柳、芦苇和耐旱的植物，只要有水灌溉，都可以变成良田。
    西北荒地勘测设计队的队员们，现正在盆地的玛纳斯河西岸勘测十五万亩荒地。这片荒地是生产建设部队某部今年计划开垦的。新修的大渠将输送大泉沟水库和玛纳斯河的水，灌溉这里行将出现的农场。
    一九五四年，荒地勘测设计队的队员，在贺兰山麓黄河两岸勘测了荒地九十万亩，今年三月，他们又来到新疆，四月初便进入玛纳斯河西岸的工地。在这缺水的地区，炊事员赶着马车，跑很远的路，把水运回来。天刚刚发白，队员们便离开了宿营地，一直到天黑才收工，这样每天可以测量荒地三千多亩。在干涸的长满了芦苇的低洼地，他们边割芦苇边测量，每天只能测一千多亩。很多队员的手都被芦苇划破了，女测工答凤琴、张志芳、江惠兰等和男同志一样，进行着艰苦的工作。和他们在这一地区工作的还有新疆省水利局和新疆军区的测量队，他们在从事农场渠道的布置。
    到五月底，他们将在这儿勘测完毕，转移到新的工地。今年秋季，拖拉机群将翻耕这片从来没有开垦过的处女地，拖拉机牵引着播种机撒下冬麦的种子，明年这个时候，绿油油的麦海，便将掀起美丽的一起一伏的麦浪。
