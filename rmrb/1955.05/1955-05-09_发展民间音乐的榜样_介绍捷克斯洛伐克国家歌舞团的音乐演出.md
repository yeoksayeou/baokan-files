A Model for Developing Folk Music
　　——Introducing the Musical Performances of the Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble
　　Deputy Director of the Central Song and Dance Ensemble　Li Ling
    "In the countryside of Czechoslovakia, the roof of every house is very pointed, because after each family has a child, they have to throw it onto the roof to test it. If it doesn't fall off, that child will not become a musician in the future. Everyone doesn't want their children to dislike music, so they try to build the roofs as pointed as possible, so no child ever rolls off the roof." This folk tale told to us by a Czechoslovak musician fully illustrates the Czechoslovak people's love of music.

    The great Czechoslovak composers Smetana, Dvořák, and Fibich grew up in such a music-loving country. Although in the period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influenced by the so-called "fin-de-siècle weariness," the decadent and backward subjective idealism and formalism in music of the bourgeoisie almost dominated the entire music scene at that time, "only the most determined people were not tempted by the bourgeoisie," but thanks to the efforts of the Czechoslovak people and their progressive musicians, during this period of turbulent currents, the musical tradition of the Czechoslovak Revival was not interrupted. Especially after the liberation of Czechoslovakia, people's music has been given more importance and development.

    From the performances of the Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble, which came to our country for a visit and performance this time, we can clearly see that they are doing everything possible to develop national music. The Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble brought a total of sixty-nine vocal programs and some folk instrumental pieces. Among the vocal programs, in addition to a few Soviet and Chinese songs, fifty-five are Czechoslovak folk songs, and there are also several new works with a particularly strong national style.

    This song and dance ensemble is not named "Folk Song and Dance Ensemble." Their singing method is similar to that of Western choirs and orchestras in terms of orchestral performance (they only have a few folk singers and a folk instrumental band composed of a small number of people), and there are many excellent soloists and choir members, and the orchestra is also of a high standard; but why do they so prominently introduce folk music? This is because they deeply realize that promoting the national musical tradition and creating new national music are inseparable. They said: "The task of our song and dance ensemble is to artistically process the music and dance of the people of all nationalities in our country, to introduce the vast treasures of folk art in our country to the broad masses of working people, and to further develop the creative power of our people. Our goal is very clear, so our programs are all working towards this direction."

    For example, the song "Dance! Dance!" (Slovak folk song, adapted by A. Košťál) which they sang is also very popular in various parts of China; but what they performed this time was a reorganized version. The song itself is very simple, with distinct rhythm and a strong sense of life. The melody is full of cheerful and enthusiastic emotions. In the choral adaptation, the author deeply grasped the characteristics of Slovak folk songs; adopting a simple harmony with Slovak folk musical traditions, not seeking excessive intensity, retaining the harmonious yet independent and beautiful melodies between the various parts, making its style very distinctive. The singers' emotions were full, deeply singing the people's mood of enjoying themselves, making the audience couldn't help but repeatedly request an encore.

    There is also "Don't Knock on the Window! Don't Knock on the Window!" (Czech folk song, adapted by A. Košťál). This song describes a girl reminding her lover not to knock loudly on her window, because her family has not yet gone to sleep, hoping that he will come again after everyone is asleep. The tune is very beautiful and playful, and the choral adaptation grasps this characteristic, expressing the girl's love and concern for her lover through a one-to-one answer sung in turn by the various parts. Although the choir's performance does not exaggerate the dramatic effect, the girl's worry about her lover causing trouble is reflected. I think this song's adaptation and performance is particularly successful. Not only does it preserve the charm of folk music very well, but the characteristics of the language are also extremely prominent; hearing it makes one feel like a Czech girl is speaking.

    "Song of the Mountain Forest Hero" (Central Slovak folk song, adapted by V. Krušak) is also an outstanding song. The song tells the story of a mountain forest hero named Jánošík, who leads his men to rob the rich and help the poor. While camping in the mountains, he misses his lover; the ruler's secret agents come, but Jánošík is not afraid, because he has loyal comrades, and even if only one person is left to fight, he will fight the enemy to the end. This song is sung in the form of a song performance. On the stage are a group of majestic warriors wearing large black round hats and draped in Chinese jackets. The song tune is simple and powerful, and the arrangement of the parts is not complicated. The lyrical part is played by only one kind of folk instrument, similar to a carrying pole, playing extremely simple tunes, expressing the hero's longing for his lover; the final chorus part is also very simple, only in key places is the harmony slightly more complex, but the heroes' spirit and demeanor of working together, being brave and resolute, are fully expressed.

    The song and dance ensemble especially emphasizes creation. They said: "We only use the old artistic finished products to a very small extent, and most of the programs must be created by ourselves; because the development of art not only depends on the ever-improving level of reproduction, but also on the artistic growth of every creator." We can see their efforts in this regard from "Peace," "How Good! How Good!" and several dance music pieces. In particular, the music for "Farmer's Dance" (composed by A. Košťál) is created very beautifully and movingly; only through the performance of a few distinctive folk instruments does it highlight the youthful and lively atmosphere of the dance. Some people say that this dance music is very moving even if it is played independently without the dance. This is not an exaggeration at all.

    We know that the music and dance workers of Czechoslovakia only began to conduct extensive and large-scale collection of folk music and folk dances in 1951; the Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble was only expanded and established in August 1952. In just two or three years, they have already sorted out and adapted so many folk art songs, and have processed them to a relatively high level; they have also entered the stage of developing new creations. The path they follow of collecting, sorting, adapting, and creating is relatively stable; they improve step by step without impatience, according to the themes of folk music, the characteristics of folk songs, the harmonic features of folk traditions, and the rules of the stage; they learn and practice from the foundation of folk music and dance, and the experience of establishing a solid foundation of socialist realism in national music and dance has great reference significance for us to create Chinese national music and dance.

    The performance characteristics of the Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble are also slightly different from those of general song and dance ensembles; their singing and playing are relatively delicate, beautiful, subtle and lively, and the pronunciation is clear and definite. They said: "The first principle of our singing is to make the audience hear every word clearly, and this requirement will not be changed even in the most difficult parts of the tune." They do not only seek a majestic sound and ignore the power hidden in the music. Their solos do not have many particularly tortuous parts, nor are there any special tunes designed to show off the voice, but are simple and approachable. This characteristic is particularly evident in the female chorus's singing of our country's "Long Live! Mao Zedong." Although they use not very strong but delicate singing voices to sing this song, they fully express that kind of youthful, enthusiastic and joyful emotion.

    The folk instrumental performance of the song and dance ensemble is also clear, delicate, rigorous and coordinated. Listening to their folk music is like seeing the delicate and lively young men of Czechoslovakia; that kind of spirit and demeanor is so unrestrained and cheerful, and has infinite youthful vitality.

    We firmly believe that the performances of the Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble in our country will greatly deepen the friendship between the people of our two countries; and will also enable our country's musicians and dancers to learn many valuable experiences.

　　发展民间音乐的榜样
　　——介绍捷克斯洛伐克国家歌舞团的音乐演出
　　中央歌舞团副团长　李凌
    “捷克斯洛伐克的乡村里，每一家的屋顶都是很尖的，因为每一家生了孩子以后，都要抛到屋顶上去试一试，如果掉不下来，那个小孩将来就不能成为音乐家。大家都不愿意自己的孩子不喜欢音乐，于是尽量地把屋顶修得尖一些，所以从来也没有一个孩子从屋顶上滚不下来。”捷克斯洛伐克音乐家告诉我们的这个民间传说，充分地说明了捷克斯洛伐克人民对音乐的热爱。
    捷克斯洛伐克的大作曲家斯麦坦纳、德沃夏克、培拉等，就是在这样一个爱好音乐的国家里生长起来的。虽然在十九世纪二十世纪交替时期，受到所谓“世纪末的疲倦”浪潮的影响，资产阶级的腐朽、落后的主观主义、形式主义的音乐，几乎支配着当时整个乐坛，“只有意志最坚强的人才没有受到资产阶级的诱惑”，但是由于捷克斯洛伐克的人民和他们进步的音乐家的努力，在这一段浊流汹涌的期间，捷克斯洛伐克复兴时期的音乐传统并未中断。特别是在捷克斯洛伐克解放以后，人民的音乐更得到了重视和发展。
    从这次来我国访问演出的捷克斯洛伐克国家歌舞团的表演节目中，我们可以明显地看出他们是在竭尽一切力量发展着民族音乐的。捷克斯洛伐克国家歌舞团，一共带来了六十九个演唱节目和一些民间器乐曲。演唱节目中除了几首苏联和中国歌曲外，有五十五首是捷克斯洛伐克的民歌，还有几个节目是民族风格特别浓厚的新作品。
    这个歌舞团并不是以“民间歌舞团”命名的，他们的演唱方法同乐队的演奏方法和西洋一般的合唱队、乐队差不多（他们只有少数民间歌唱者和一个由少数人组成的民间器乐队），其中有着不少优秀的独唱家和合唱队员，管弦乐队也有很高的水平；但是，为什么他们这样突出地介绍民间音乐呢？这是由于他们深刻地认识了：发扬民族的音乐传统和创造新的民族音乐是分不开的。他们说：“我们这个歌舞团的任务是对我国各民族人民的音乐和舞蹈作艺术上的加工，向广大的劳动人民介绍我国民间艺术的丰富宝藏，使我们人民的创作力量得到进一步发展。我们的目标很明确，因此我们的节目都是朝着这个方向来努力的。”
    比如他们唱的“跳吧！跳吧！”（斯洛伐克民歌，阿·科什塔尔改编）这首歌曲在中国各地也很流行；但他们这次所表演的，却是经过整理的。歌曲本身很纯朴，节奏鲜明，生活气息浓厚，旋律充满欢快、热烈的情感。在合唱改编上，作者深深地抓住了斯洛伐克民歌的特点；采取简朴而带有斯洛伐克民间音乐传统的和声，不求过度的浓重，保留着各个声部间的调协而又独立的优美的旋律，使它的风貌很有特色。演唱者的感情充沛，深刻地唱出了人民尽情玩乐的情绪，使得观众禁不住再三地要求重唱一次。
    还有“别敲窗！别敲窗！”（捷克民歌，阿·科什塔尔改编）这首歌是描写一个少女提醒她的情人不要大声地敲她的窗子，因为她家里的人还没有睡觉，希望他等大家睡着了再来。曲调非常健美、俏皮，合唱的改编掌握了这个特点，通过各个声部轮流歌唱的一对一答，来表现少女对情人的爱恋和关切。合唱队的演唱虽然没有夸张那种戏剧效果，但是少女耽心爱人搞出乱子的心情却是体现出来了。我觉得这首歌曲的改编和表演特别成功，不但很好地保存了民间音乐的韵味，语言的特色也极突出；一听就使人感到是一位捷克少女在说话似的。
    “山林英雄之歌”（斯洛伐克中部民歌，符·克鲁沙克改编）也是一首特出的歌曲。歌曲内容述说一个率领部下劫富济贫的山林英雄雅诺希卡在山上宿营时，想念起自己的爱人；统治者的密探来了，但雅诺希卡并不害怕，因为他有忠实的战友，即使战斗到只剩下一个人，也要和敌人拼到底。这首歌曲是采用歌表演的形式歌唱的，舞台上出现的是一群带着大黑圆帽、披着中褂的雄赳赳的勇士，歌调纯朴而有劲，声部的编配也不复杂；其中的抒情部分，只由一种像担杆一样的民间乐器吹奏出极简单的音调，便表现出英雄对爱人思念的心境；最后的合唱部分也很简朴，只在关键的地方，和声才稍为复杂一些，但英雄们那种同心协力，英勇果敢的精神和风貌，却充分地表现出来了。
    歌舞团特别强调创作，他们说：“我们只在很小的程度上利用旧有的艺术成品，大部分节目必须由我们自己创作；因为艺术的发展不仅是依靠日益发展的复制水平，而且还依靠每一位创作工作者艺术上的成长。”他们在这方面的努力，我们可以从
  “和平”“多好呀！多好呀！”和几曲舞蹈音乐中看出来。特别是“农作舞”（阿·科什塔尔作曲）的音乐，创作得非常优美动人；只通过少数富有特色的民间乐器的演奏，便把舞蹈的青春、活泼的气氛突现出来。有人说，这首舞曲即使离开舞蹈独立演奏，也是非常动人的。这是一点也不夸张的。
    我们知道，捷克斯洛伐克的音乐舞蹈工作者在一九五一年才开始进行广泛的、大量的搜集民间音乐和民间舞蹈的工作；捷克斯洛伐克国家歌舞团，也只是在一九五二年八月才扩大成立。在短短的两三年中，他们已经整理、改编了这么多的民间艺术歌曲，并有了相当高的水平的加工；创作上也进入到发展新创作的时期。他们遵循的这条比较稳当的搜集、整理、改编、创作的道路；他们根据民间音乐的主题，按照民歌特点、民间传统的和声特色及舞台法则，一步一步毫不急躁地认真加以改进的作法；他们从民间音乐舞蹈的基础上学习、实践，建立根基稳固的社会主义现实主义的民族音乐舞蹈的经验，对我们创造中国民族音乐舞蹈来说都是很有借鉴意义的。
    捷克斯洛伐克国家歌舞团的演奏特点，和一般歌舞团也稍有不同；他们的演唱和演奏，比较细致、优美、含蓄而活泼，语音清晰、明确。他们说：“我们歌唱的第一要义是要使观众听清楚每一个字，虽然在曲调最困难的地方，也不让这个要求有所改变。”他们并不只求声音雄壮而忽略音乐深藏的力量。他们的独唱没有很多特别曲折的地方，也没有专为表现嗓子的特殊曲调，而是纯朴近人的。这种特点在女声合唱我国的“万岁！毛泽东”中表现得特别明显。她们虽用不十分强烈而清秀的歌声来演唱这首歌曲，却充分地表现了那种充满青春活力、热情欢乐的情绪。
    歌舞团的民间器乐表演，也是清晰细致，严整而协调的。听了他们的民乐，正如看到捷克斯洛伐克清秀、活泼的小伙子一样；那种精神和风貌是如此潇洒、爽朗，又带有无限的青春活力。
    我们深信，捷克斯洛伐克国家歌舞团在我国的演出，将使我们两国人民的情谊大大加深；也会使我国的音乐工作者和舞蹈工作者学习到许多宝贵经验。
