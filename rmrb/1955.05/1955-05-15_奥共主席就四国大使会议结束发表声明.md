Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, May 13th: According to TASS, Johann Koplenig, Chairman of the Austrian Communist Party and Member of Parliament, issued a statement on the successful conclusion of the Four-Power Ambassadorial Conference and the imminent signing of the Austrian State Treaty.

The statement said that the successful conclusion of the Ambassadorial Conference is a very pleasant thing for every Austrian. In the future, the Austrian people will control their own destiny. There will be no foreign troops or military bases in Austria, and Austria will not be involved in any military treaties.

The statement said that the task of the Austrian people now is to ensure that the neutrality they demand is guaranteed, so that Austria can develop its own economy, improve the living standards of the working people, and meet their just demands. The Austrian people should thank the Soviet Union, because despite all difficulties and obstacles, the Soviet Union made it possible to sign the Austrian State Treaty and effectively protected Austria's interests at the Ambassadorial Conference.

The statement pointed out that the Austrian Communist Party, from the time of Austria's re-establishment, has fought, regardless of all persecution, for a policy of peace and mutual understanding, which has now finally brought Austria the long-awaited independence, unity, and freedom.

The statement concluded by saying that we believe that this will not only promote the cause of peace in Austria, but also the cause of peace in Europe and the world.
