Gansu Agan Town and Other Coal Mines Begin Expansion
    The reconstruction projects of the Agan Town Coal Mine and the Shimengou Coal Mine, the largest coal-producing areas in Gansu Province, have mostly started. Hundreds of pneumatic drill operators, support workers, slag haulers, blasters, and arch builders are working intensively on arch construction and tunneling of the main roadways. More than a thousand laborers are building river dams and leveling the ground for buildings such as screening towers and coal storage yards. The construction of the Lan (Zhou) A (gan Town) Railway is also being actively prepared.
    The various reconstruction projects of these two coal mines will be handed over for production in May and September 1956, respectively. At that time, the coal output of the Agan Town Coal Mine and the Shimengou Coal Mine will reach ten times that of 1953, which can supply a large amount of industrial coal needed by Lanzhou City. At the same time, a series of production processes from coal mining and hoisting to transportation will be fully mechanized. (Our correspondent in Lanzhou)

　  甘肃阿干镇等煤矿开始扩建
    甘肃省最大产煤区阿干镇煤矿和石门沟煤矿的改建工程大部分已经开工。数百名风钻工、支柱工、运碴工、放炮工、砌碹工正在紧张地进行大巷的砌碹和掘进工作。一千多名壮工正在修建河坝，为筛选楼、贮煤仓等建筑平整地面。兰（州）阿（干镇）铁路的修建工程也在积极准备中。
    这两个煤矿的各项改建工程将分别在一九五六年五月和九月移交生产。那时候，阿干镇煤矿和石门沟煤矿的煤产量，将达到一九五三年的十倍，可以大量供应兰州市需要的工业用煤。同时，从采煤、提升一直到运输等一系列的生产过程，都将完全机械化。　（本报驻兰州记者）
