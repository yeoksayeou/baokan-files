An Interview with Mr. Takano Minoru, Head of the Japanese Workers' Delegation to China
　　By our reporter Feng Zhidan

　　On May Day, Beijing, bathed in sunshine, was immersed in joyous celebrations. The Japanese Workers' Delegation to China, composed of representatives from thirty-one Japanese trade unions, who were invited to visit our country, joyfully spent this glorious holiday with the people of Beijing. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, hundreds of thousands of workers, under a continuous downpour, held a celebration rally with umbrellas. Despite the many obstacles on the road from Beijing to Tokyo, the working people of the two places understand each other, and they jointly held aloft the banner of peace and freedom as they celebrated May Day in their respective locations.

　　The day after the May Day celebrations in the capital, I had the opportunity to interview Mr. Takano Minoru, the head of the Japanese Workers' Delegation to China. Mr. Takano is a famous Japanese trade union activist and the Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the largest trade union organization in Japan.

　　Our conversation naturally began with the May Day celebration. Mr. Takano talked about his impressions. He said: "I was deeply moved by the May Day celebrations. My first outstanding impression was the heartfelt joy of the Chinese people. On our way to Beijing, we saw bright, hopeful people everywhere, and we were warmly welcomed everywhere."

　　Mr. Takano continued: "I was also moved by the Chinese people's strong desire for peace. In the May Day parade, people shouted that they would use all their strength to build their country. I found that in China, striving for peace is not an empty slogan, but a concrete action. People put forward vivid slogans such as good health, good work, and good study to encourage socialist peaceful construction. I also found that the Chinese people have a strong will to hate and oppose imperialist aggression. I saw slogans on May Day opposing the revival of Japanese militarism by the United States and the determination to liberate Taiwan. These show that the Chinese people are full of hope for the peaceful construction of their country on the one hand, and full of confidence in defeating imperialist aggression on the other. I think that is why the Chinese people are so joyful and optimistic."

　　Mr. Takano praised the Chinese people's love for their great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, praised the magnificence of the parade, and also praised the beautiful fireworks on May Day night, like "a brilliant stage"... He said: "For our Japanese workers' delegation, all this is unforgettable."

　　Mr. Takano is a Japanese trade union leader, so the reporter asked him to talk about the Japanese workers' movement. He told the reporter about the tasks of the Japanese workers' movement and the workers' aspirations. Mr. Takano said: "Striving for peace is our primary task. Opposing the preparation for atomic war and demanding that Japan restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China are the central issues for the Japanese working class to contribute to world peace." At the same time, Mr. Takano repeatedly emphasized that opposing the revival of Japanese militarism has also become an important slogan in the Japanese workers' movement and the international workers' movement.

　　"Opposing the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons," Mr. Takano pointed out, "is not only related to the lives of the Japanese people, but also to the fate of the entire Japanese nation. Therefore, the Japanese working class has the potential to unite the vast majority of the Japanese people in this movement."

　　Talking about the extensive struggle of the Japanese working class to restore Japanese-Soviet and Japanese-Chinese diplomatic relations, Mr. Takano said: "Japanese workers have widely participated in the movement demanding the restoration of Japanese-Soviet and Japanese-Chinese diplomatic relations and demanding free and mutually beneficial trade with any foreign country. Despite many obstacles, negotiations for the restoration of Japanese-Soviet diplomatic relations are about to begin on June 1. Improving relations between Japan and China and developing Japanese-Chinese trade are even more urgent demands of Japanese workers and the vast majority of people. Last autumn, Ms. Li Dequan visited Japan and conveyed the Chinese people's desire for friendship with the Japanese people and their desire for peace, which left a deep impression in the hearts of the Japanese people. Subsequently, the Chinese trade delegation to Japan also arrived in Japan. These were all promoted by the rising aspirations of the Japanese people."

　　However, Mr. Takano emphasized: "Improving Japanese-Chinese relations and developing Japanese-Chinese trade are not without difficulties. Today, from important figures in the Japanese government to the families of workers, everyone understands that the obstacles in this regard come from Washington. In fact, I know that the Chinese trade delegation to Japan has already encountered such obstacles in Japan. Japanese workers and the Japanese people will fight to overcome these obstacles."

　　Speaking of this, Mr. Takano pointed out that Japanese workers and the Japanese people firmly support international friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence. He said: "The recent Asian Countries Conference and the Asian-African Conference provided examples in this regard. Both conferences achieved brilliant successes. The Asian Countries Conference was attended by social figures from different strata and with different ideas from various countries, and the Bandung Conference was attended by government representatives from countries with different social systems and political systems in Asia and Africa. However, they all found a common ground in their differences and reached a unanimous agreement. These two international conferences well elaborated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and proved the growth of the strength of the world's people in demanding peace and prosperity."

　　Finally, Mr. Takano focused on the struggle of Japanese workers for their own rights. He said, "It is very important to emphasize this point." The profound meaning of this sentence is completely understandable. Today, Japan is in a state of semi-occupation by the American army. The workers are suffering from the increasingly heavy exploitation of the "Hurry Up" system. The intensity of labor has been shockingly increased. The ranks of the unemployed are constantly expanding. The living standards of the working masses are facing increasingly serious attacks. It is enough to imagine such a number: Even according to official statistics, the total number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in Japan had reached the huge number of 12 million by the end of October 1953. The top ten textile companies in Japan laid off about half of their workers between April 1952 and April 1953. The real wages of those still employed are also nearly half less than before the war. Therefore, Mr. Takano said with emotion: "Today, the families of Japanese workers are asking: 'What will happen to our lives if our children's fathers are laid off?' This is tantamount to the truth that two plus two equals four, and it can only be a dead end. Therefore, protecting the jobs of the children's fathers and opposing layoffs has become a widespread movement involving the families of workers."

　　Mr. Takano paused for a moment, took a book entitled "Mothers and Children of the Japan Steel Works" from the shelf, and handed it to the reporter. This book contains the true records of the wives and children of workers at the Muroran Factory of the Japan Steel Works calling for the right to survive. Thousands of workers at this factory persisted in a strike against layoffs for more than 190 days from June of last year, and finally won. In this struggle, the families of the workers also participated. Mr. Takano pointed to two poems written by elementary school students in the book and said to me: "Look, the children all know how to fight, and life is educating them. When I recited these two poems at a workers' meeting, the workers all shed tears."

　　An elementary school student wrote a poem entitled "Don't Worry, Your Child Will Persevere to the End":

　　"Today,
　　Mom and Dad are not home again;
　　The summer vacation I wanted to play with Mom,
　　Only I am left alone again.
　　Mom said:
　　'If the union wins,
　　I'll take you to play happily;
　　Sneakers, a sports cap,
　　I'll buy them all for you.
　　Wait, child,
　　Now you can play with this headband!'"
　　I said:
　　"This headband has Mom's sweat on it!"
　　Mom said:
　　"Is that so? Is that so?"
　　Tie it tightly on my head."

　　Mr. Takano put down the book and continued: "In the Tokugawa shogunate era in Japan, the ruling class implemented a policy of 'not letting you live, nor letting you die.' Now the United States is also adopting this policy towards the Japanese people. The United States uses all kinds of means to extract the blood and sweat of Japanese workers. Especially after the signing of the US-Japan 'Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement,' I said long ago that Japanese workers have been tightly bound..."

　　Mr. Takano summarized his conversation with a decisive gesture, saying: "The struggle of Japanese workers for their own rights is inseparable from the struggle for peace, demanding the restoration of Japanese-Chinese and Japanese-Soviet diplomatic relations, and striving for national independence. They are one and the same thing, not two separate things."

　　[Note] The headband is a symbol and ancient tradition of the Japanese people in carrying out resistance struggles. Japanese workers wear headbands when they strike.

　　访日本工人访华代表团团长高野实
　　本报记者  冯之丹
    五一节那天，阳光普照下的北京浸沉在欢乐的庆祝里，应邀来我国访问的、由日本三十一个工会代表混合组成的日本工人访华代表团，同北京市民一起，愉快地度过了这个光辉的节日。同时，在东京，数十万劳动者也在连绵的大雨下，撑着雨伞，举行了庆祝集会。从北京到东京的道路上，尽管有着许多障碍物，但是两地的劳动人民是相互了解的，他们在各自庆祝五一节的时候，共同高举着和平和自由的大旗。
    在首都五一节庆典以后的一天，我有机会访问了日本工人访华代表团团长高野实先生。高野先生是日本著名的工会活动家、日本最大的工会组织——日本工会总评议会的事务局长。
    我们的谈话很自然地是从“五一”盛典开始。高野先生谈到他的观感。他说：“五一观礼使我深深地感动了。我的第一个突出的印象是中国人民发自内心的喜悦。我们在来北京的途中，到处都看到明朗的、满怀希望的人们，到处都受到热情的欢迎。”
    高野先生接着说：“我也为中国人民要求和平的强烈愿望所感动。在五一节的游行行列中，人们高呼要用一切力量来建设自己的祖国。我发现，在中国，争取和平不是空洞的口号，而是具体的行动。人们提出身体好、工作好、学习好等生动的口号来鼓舞社会主义的和平建设。我也发现，中国人民憎恨和反对帝国主义侵略的坚强的意志。我看到在“五一”口号中有反对美国复活日本军国主义和一定要解放台湾的口号。这些表明，中国人民一方面对自己国家的和平建设满怀希望；另一方面对击败帝国主义的侵略充满着信心。我认为，这就是为什么中国人是这样的欢欣和乐观。”
    高野先生赞赏中国人民对他们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的热爱，赞赏游行队伍的壮观，也赞赏“五一”之夜，像“一座灿烂的舞台”那样美丽的焰火……。他说：“对于我们日本工人代表团来说，这一切都是令人难忘的。”
    高野先生是日本的工会领袖，记者就请他谈谈日本的工人运动。他向记者谈到日本工人运动的任务和工人的愿望。高野先生说：“争取和平是我们首要的任务。反对准备原子战争，要求日本同苏联、中国恢复邦交，都是日本工人阶级对世界和平有所贡献的中心课题。”同时，高野先生一再强调，反对复活日本军国主义也已经成为日本工人运动和国际工人运动中的一个重要口号。
    “反对使用原子武器和氢武器，”高野先生指出，“这不仅关乎日本人民的生命，也关乎整个日本的民族命运。因此，日本工人阶级有可能在这个运动中团结日本广大人民进行斗争。”
    谈到日本工人阶级为恢复日苏、日中邦交而进行的广泛的斗争，高野先生说：“日本工人广泛地参加了要求恢复日苏、日中邦交和要求同任何外国进行自由和互惠贸易的运动。尽管有重重障碍，日苏恢复邦交的谈判就要在六月一日开始举行了。改善日中两国的关系和发展日中贸易更是日本工人和广大人民的迫切要求。去年秋季，李德全女士访问日本，传达了中国人民要求同日本人民友好，要求和平的心情，这在日本人民心中留下了深刻的记忆。随后中国访问日本贸易代表团也到了日本。这些都是日本人民高涨的愿望所促成的。”
    但是，高野先生强调说：“改善日中关系，发展日中贸易，并不是没有困难的。今天上至日本政府的要人，下至工人家属都了解，这方面的障碍来自华盛顿。事实上我知道，中国访问日本贸易代表团在日本已经遇到了这种障碍。日本工人和日本人民将要为克服这些障碍而进行斗争。”
    谈到这里，高野先生指出，日本工人和日本人民坚决拥护国际间的友好合作，和平共处。他说：“最近召开的亚洲国家会议和亚非会议就提供了这方面的范例。两个会议都取得了辉煌的成就。亚洲国家会议有各国阶层不同、思想不同的社会人士参加，万隆会议有亚非两洲各个社会制度和政治制度不同的国家的政府代表参加，然而他们都在不同中找到了共同的基础，取得了一致的协议。这两个国际会议很好地阐明了和平共处的五项原则，证明了世界人民要求和平和繁荣的力量的壮大。”
    最后，高野先生着重谈到了日本工人为切身权利而进行的斗争。他说，“强调这一点是太重要了。”这句话的深沉含意是完全可以理解的，今天的日本处在美国军队半占领的状态之下，工人们受着“赶快”制度的加重压榨，劳动强度惊人地加强了，失业者的队伍不断地扩大，劳动群众的生活水平遭到了越来越严重的进攻。只要设想一下这样的数字就够了：即使根据官方的统计，全日本失业和半失业人口在一九五三年十月底就已达到一千二百万人的巨大数目。日本十大纺织公司在一九五二年四月和一九五三年四月解雇了大约一半工人。那些在业的工人，实际工资较战前也少了将近一半。因此，高野先生感慨地说：“今天日本的工人家属们都在问：‘孩子们的爸爸被裁掉了的话，生活怎么办呢？’这无异是二加二等于四的真理一样，只可能是走投无路。所以保卫孩子们的爸爸的职业，反对解雇，已成为包括有职工家属参加的广泛的运动。”
    高野先生停顿了一会，从架子上抽出一本名为“日本制钢所的母亲和孩子们”的书来，递给记者。在这本书中有着日本制钢所室兰工厂的工人妻子和孩子们呼吁争取生存权利的真实纪录。这个工厂的数千名工人从去年六月开始坚持了一百九十多天的反解雇罢工斗争，终于获得了胜利。在这个斗争中，工人们的家属也参加了。高野先生指着书中两首小学生所写的诗向我说：“你看，孩子们都懂得斗争了，生活教育着他们。当我在工人集会中朗诵这两首诗时，工人们都掉下了热泪。”
    一个小学生以“放心吧，你的孩子会坚持到底”为题写道：
      “今天，
    爸爸妈妈又不在家；
    想跟妈妈一起玩的暑假，
    又只剩下了我一个人。
    妈妈说：
    ‘团结组要是得到胜利，
    带你痛痛快快地去玩；
    球鞋、运动帽，
    都给你买。
    等着吧，孩子，
    现在你就拿这条头巾〔注〕去玩吧！’
    我说：
    ‘这条头巾上有妈妈的汗味呀！’
    妈妈说：
    ‘是么？是么？’
    把它紧紧地扎在我的头上。”
    高野先生放下了书，继续说道：“在日本的德川幕府时代，统治阶级执行一种‘不让你活，也不让你死’的政策，现在美国对于日本人民也采取这种政策。美国人用形形色色的手段来榨取日本工人的血汗。特别是美日‘共同防御援助协定’签订后，我早就说过，日本工人已被紧紧地捆起来了。……”
    高野先生以果断的手势总结了他的谈话，他说：“日本工人争取切身权利的斗争是同争取和平、要求恢复日中、日苏邦交和争取民族独立的斗争分不开的。它们是一回事，并不是两回事。”
        〔注〕头巾是日本人民进行反抗斗争的标志和古
    老的传统，日本工人在罢工时都扎上头巾。
