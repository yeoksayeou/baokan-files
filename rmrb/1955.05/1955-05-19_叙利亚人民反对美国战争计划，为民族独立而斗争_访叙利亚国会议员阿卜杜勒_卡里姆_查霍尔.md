　　Syrian People Oppose U.S. War Plans and Fight for National Independence
　　——An Interview with Syrian Member of Parliament Abdul Karim Chahur
　　By Jin Feng, our correspondent
    When we were little, almost as soon as we started our first lessons, the teacher wrote strange symbols on the blackboard – Arabic numerals. The words "Arabic" were intertwined with our memories of our first lessons and our initial understanding of numbers. When we grew a little older, the famous "Arabian Nights" took us to a strange world. We saw the beautiful brocades of Damascus, the fantastic and picturesque plains by the Euphrates River, the majestic and exquisite mosques of Mecca, and the colorful and gorgeous costumes of Baghdad and Egypt...
    But how do the Arab people live now?
    Syrian Member of Parliament Abdul Karim Chahur, who recently visited New China, told us – several reporters who interviewed him – with heavy emotion: "The lives of the Arab people today are like the lives of the Chinese people before liberation."
    Just one sentence is enough for us to understand the full weight of his words.
    After a pause, Mr. Chahur said thoughtfully: "Coming to New China, I am often haunted by two very different emotions. The Chinese people have found their path, and 600 million people have begun to take control of their own destiny, working with humility, optimism, and confidence. The destinies of the people of all countries cannot be separated. Six hundred million people have found the path to freedom and socialism, which is closer to the light of all mankind. This is what makes us deeply happy. At the same time, I painfully ask myself: Why can't we freely build our country? Why can't we start breathing the air of freedom? Why can't we explore our country's rich resources? Why can't we move towards the road of freedom, independence, prosperity, and strength?..." "This series of 'whys' is heartbreaking," Mr. Chahur said slowly, "The fundamental answer to all these 'whys' is that imperialism has invaded, oppressed, and plundered us, and recently attempted to tie us to the criminal wheels of its plans to launch a new war."
    In condemning the imperialist aggression against Arab countries, Mr. Chahur focused on the colonialist plunder and sinister subversive activities of the United States in Syria, as well as the Syrian people's struggle against U.S. war plans and for national independence.
    As in other regions, the United States' activities in Syria began with economic infiltration. After World War II, the pipelines of U.S. oil companies established in Saudi Arabia and Iraq traversed Syria, and the tentacles of U.S. oil companies' branches in Syria extended into various Syrian enterprises. U.S. capital penetrated the Syria-Lebanon Bank, the only bank in Syria and Lebanon that issued banknotes. It is not difficult to imagine that U.S. capital thereby controlled many industrial and agricultural production enterprises in Syria and Lebanon. The economic infiltration led to political activities. The U.S. Embassy in Damascus repeatedly participated in launching coups in Syria. In 1951, the United States supported the pro-American dictatorship of Shishakli. However, under the pressure of the strong anti-imperialist movement of the Syrian people in recent years, this dictatorial pro-American regime finally collapsed in February 1954. But when Syria held elections in October 1954, U.S. imperialism openly intervened. The U.S. Ambassador to Syria protested against the Syrian government's acceptance of the Communist Party's participation in the election, and also protested against New China's participation in the international exposition held in Damascus. Syrian public opinion severely condemned the U.S. Ambassador's activities, considering them to be interference in Syria's internal affairs. The Syrian parliamentary elections were conducted under the slogan of anti-imperialism, and voters entrusted their trust to those who rejected imperialist war plans. At a mass rally of tens of thousands of people in Damascus, the masses shouted: "We want independence, not orders from Washington!" When Dulles came to the Lebanese capital, the Syrian people widely demonstrated, demanding that Dulles take his war plan back. When U.S. diplomats in the Middle East held a meeting in Damascus, the Syrian trade unions decided to hold a general strike, and students held large-scale demonstrations, shouting: "The Syrian and other Arab peoples today hate U.S. policy." The Syrian newspaper "Al-Sout" drew a cartoon depicting U.S. diplomats sitting around a table, holding knives and dividing the corpses of Arabs. "Alef Ba" said: "If you really want to discuss problems... you yourselves are the problem, the source of all problems... The Arab people have experienced the terrible era of British rule, and they do not want to experience the terrible era of American rule again!"
    Under the influence of such a magnificent movement of the Syrian people against U.S. imperialism, the Syrian government rejected the notorious U.S. "Point Four Program," refused to participate in the Turco-Pakistani and Turco-Iraqi pacts, and did not want U.S. military aid. The first thing the new Syrian government announced after taking office recently was: "Reject military treaties and military aid." Syrian women, workers, students, and legal professionals wrote letters to the parliament, supporting the government's position against the Turco-Iraqi pact. When the U.S. government formally sent a note suggesting that Syria participate in the Turco-Iraqi pact, the Syrian workers' delegation angrily denounced "the U.S. government's note... brutally interfering in Syria's internal affairs and attempting to forcibly drag us into the Western imperialist aggressive treaty." When the Turkish army demonstrated and exercised 20 kilometers away from the Syrian border, 20,000 Syrian workers demonstrated, condemning Turkey and the United States for exerting pressure and provocation on Syria.
      "The Syrian and other Arab peoples are engaged in a sharp struggle against imperialist war plans and for national independence," Mr. Chahur emphatically concluded, "We urgently need the support of the free people of the world." He spoke with great satisfaction of the Asian countries conference he had personally attended not long ago, as well as the Asian-African conference held in Bandung with Syrian representatives participating. He said that in Delhi and at the Bandung Conference, the Chinese delegation supported the struggle of the Arab people with a noble attitude. He believed that Premier Zhou's speech on the Arab world at the Asian-African Conference would have a good impact among the Arab people and would further strengthen the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Arab people. He said: "What we need now is a united struggle. As long as we are united, we can dig the grave of the common enemy of mankind – imperialism." He was very pleased to talk about the news published in the newspaper that Egypt had suggested to the Arab League countries that they recognize New China, saying: "Our Syrian Foreign Affairs Committee representatives also have the same suggestion, which proves that China and the Arab world have further approached and understood each other."
      He spoke vividly and interestingly about his impressions of coming to New China. "A true spirit of democracy," he raised his first finger and said: "Free discussion and free criticism to correct shortcomings, the purpose of which is to help build." "A strong sense of responsibility," Mr. Chahur raised his second finger: "A humble attitude and confidence in strength."
  "The third point is," he smiled, shaking his three fingers: "The grand scale of urban and rural construction. We have visited many factories, cooperatives, and state-owned farms, and when we studied the production figures before and after liberation, we saw how big a step New China has taken in construction. All construction is for the people. From the comparison of the past and present lives of workers and farmers, it is particularly clear that the purpose of their current production is for their own benefit. We also visited the dormitories of employees in various places and studied the prices of various commodities, and came to the conclusion that the Chinese people are now truly living a decent life. Not long ago, they were still mired in slave-like labor like us. Of course, this is just the beginning, and the future is infinitely bright."
    Mr. Chahur visited the mosque in Guangzhou and the Hui Nationality College in Beijing. He said: "I am very happy to see that ethnic minorities in China have such complete freedom of belief and legal status." He was very interested in the Arabic Koran given to him by the China Islamic Association, which was published after liberation. He said he would take it back to Syria as a precious souvenir.
    Finally, he hoped that the Chinese people would complete the unification of their sacred territory and that the friendship with the Arab people would be strengthened day by day.

　　叙利亚人民反对美国战争计划，为民族独立而斗争
　　——访叙利亚国会议员阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·查霍尔
　　本报记者　金凤
    当我们小的时候，差不多是上第一课的时候，老师在黑板上写出了奇怪的符号——阿拉伯数目字，这“阿拉伯”三个字就和我们第一课的回忆，最初数目字的认识交织在一起了。等到我们长大一点，著名的“天方夜谭”又带我们到了一个奇异的世界。我们看到大马士革美丽的锦织物、幼发拉底河边奇幻如画的平原、麦加的庄严精妙的清真寺院，巴格达和埃及的彩色艳丽的服饰……
    但是，现在的阿拉伯人民怎样生活着了？
    最近来新中国访问的叙利亚国会议员阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·查霍尔先生带着沉重的感情告诉我们——几个对他进行访问的记者：“阿拉伯人民今天的生活就像没有解放以前的中国人民一样。”
    只一句话，就足够使我们了解他的话的全部重量了。
    停了一回，查霍尔先生深思地说：“来到新中国，常常有两种极不相同的感情萦绕着我。中国人民已经找到了她的道路，六亿人民已经开始掌握自己的命运，在谦虚、乐观、有信心地工作着。各国人民的命运是不能分开的。六亿人民已经找到自由和社会主义的道路，就更接近于全人类的光明。这就是使我们深深欣喜的。同时，我痛切地问自己：为什么我们不能自由建设我们的国家？为什么我们不能开始呼吸自由的空气？为什么我们不能发掘我们国家丰富的资源？为什么我们不能走向自由、独立、富强的道路？……”“这一连串的‘为什么’是令人痛心的”，查霍尔先生缓缓地说：“这一切
  ‘为什么’的根本回答是：帝国主义侵略、压迫、掠夺了我们，最近还企图把我们绑到它准备发动新战争的罪恶的车轮上去。”
    查霍尔先生在谴责帝国主义对阿拉伯国家的侵略时，着重谈到了美国在叙利亚的殖民主义掠夺和罪恶的颠覆活动以及叙利亚人民反对美国战争计划、争取民族独立的斗争。
    和在其他地区一样，美国在叙利亚的活动是从经济渗透开始的。第二次世界大战以后，美国在沙特阿拉伯和伊拉克设立的石油公司的油管都横穿过叙利亚，美国石油公司在叙利亚的分公司的触须就伸展到叙利亚的各种企业中去。美国资本打入了叙利亚—黎巴嫩银行，这个银行是叙利亚和黎巴嫩两国唯一的发行钞票的银行。不难想见，美国资本由此操纵着叙利亚和黎巴嫩的许多工业和农业生产企业。由经济的渗透进到政治上的活动。美国通过驻大马士革的大使馆一次次参预发动了叙利亚的政变。一九五一年美国扶植了亲美的施舍克里独裁政权登台。但在几年来叙利亚人民强大的反对帝国主义运动的压力下，这个独裁的亲美政权终于在一九五四年二月倒台了。但在一九五四年十月叙利亚进行选举时，美帝国主义公开出面干涉。美国驻叙利亚大使抗议叙利亚政府接纳共产党参加竞选，又抗议新中国参加在大马士革举办的国际博览会。叙利亚的舆论严厉谴责美国大使这种活动，认为这是对叙利亚内政的干涉。叙利亚的议会选举在反对帝国主义的口号下进行，选民把信任交给那些拒绝帝国主义战争计划的人。在大马士革举行的万人群众大会上，群众喊出：“我们要独立，不要华盛顿的命令！”杜勒斯来到黎巴嫩首都的时候，叙利亚的人民广泛地游行示威，要杜勒斯带着他的战争计划滚回去。美国驻中东的外交官在大马士革举行会议时，叙利亚的工会决定总罢工，学生举行大规模的示威游行，他们喊出：“叙利亚和其他国家的阿拉伯人民今天都仇恨美国的政策。”叙利亚的“呼声报”画了一幅漫画，画着美国外交人员坐在一张桌子周围，手里拿着刀在分割阿拉伯人的尸体。“阿勒弗·巴报”说：“如果你们真正想讨论问题的话……你们自己就是问题，就是所有问题的来源……阿拉伯人民经历过英国统治的可怕时代，他们不愿意再经历美国统治的可怕时代！”
    就在叙利亚人民这样波澜壮阔的反对美帝国主义的运动影响之下，叙利亚政府拒绝了美国臭名昭彰的“第四点计划”，拒绝参加土巴、土伊协定，不要美国的军事援助。叙利亚最近的新政府上台以后宣布的第一条就是：“拒绝军事条约和军事援助。”叙利亚的妇女、工人、学生、法律工作者纷纷写信给议会，支持政府反对土伊条约的立场。当美国政府正式致送照会，建议叙利亚参加土伊条约时，叙利亚的工人代表团愤怒地斥责“美国政府的照会……粗暴地干涉叙利亚的内政并企图硬拉我们参加西方帝国主义的侵略条约”。土耳其军队在离叙利亚边境二十公里地方示威演习时，叙利亚两万名工人示威游行，谴责土耳其和美国对叙利亚施加压力和挑衅。
      “叙利亚和阿拉伯其他国家的人民正在进行尖锐的反对帝国主义战争计划、争取民族独立的斗争”，查霍尔先生着重地归结说，“我们迫切需要全世界自由的人民的支持”。他以十分满意的口吻谈到不久以前他亲身参加的亚洲国家会议以及在万隆召开的有叙利亚代表参加的亚非会议。他说在德里以及在万隆会议上，中国代表团都以崇高的态度支持阿拉伯人民的斗争。他相信周总理在亚非会议上关于阿拉伯的发言将在阿拉伯人民中产生良好的影响，将进一步加强中国和阿拉伯人民的友好和团结。他说：“目前我们所需要的就是团结一致的斗争。我们只要一致，就可以挖掘人类共同的敌人——帝国主义的坟墓。”他十分高兴地谈到报纸所登载的埃及向阿拉伯联盟各国建议承认新中国的消息说：“我们叙利亚外交委员会代表也有相同的建议，这就是中国和阿拉伯已进一步互相接近、了解的证明。”
      他生动有趣地谈到他来新中国的印象。“真正的民主精神”，他举起了第一个手指说：“自由讨论和自由的批评来纠正缺点，这样的目的是为了帮助建设。”“坚强的责任感”，查霍尔先生举起了他的二个手指：“谦虚的态度和对于力量的信心。”
  “第三点是”，他笑着，摇晃着他的三个手指： “城市和农村建设规模的宏大。我们走过许多工厂、合作社和国营农场，在对于解放前后生产的数字作了研究的时候，我们看到新中国在建设方面走了多大的一步。一切的建设为了人民。从工人和农民过去、现在生活的对比上特别可以清楚地看到他们现在生产的目的是为了他们自己的利益。我们还参观了各地的职工宿舍，研究了各种商品的价格，得出的结论是：中国人民现在真正过着像样的生活。而不久以前，他们还和我们一样是沉在奴隶般劳动的泥潭里。自然，这还仅仅是开始，前途是无限美好的。”
    查霍尔先生在广州参观了清真寺，在北京参观了回民学院。他说：“看到中国少数民族有着这样完全的信仰自由和法律地位真高兴。”他非常感到兴趣的是中国伊斯兰教协会送他的阿拉伯文可兰经，这是在解放以后出版的。他说他将带回叙利亚作为珍贵的纪念。
    最后他希望中国人民完成自己神圣领土的统一，同阿拉伯人民的友谊日益加强。
