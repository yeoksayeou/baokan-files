Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 21st: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, at its sixth plenary session held on the 20th, heard the government statement made by Prime Minister Grotewohl and unanimously approved the Eight-Nation Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance.

In his government statement, Prime Minister Grotewohl explained the content of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, and pointed out that the Warsaw Treaty is a tool for easing international tensions, safeguarding the peace and security of the peoples of all countries, and also a step towards restoring German unity on the basis of peace and democracy. This treaty is a new source of strength for the German Democratic Republic. The government of the German Democratic Republic will spare no effort to continue to fight for the peace, democracy, and unity of Germany.

Grotewohl said: "The Warsaw Treaty has a direct and positive impact on the security and peace of Europe and Germany. Only by abolishing the Paris Agreements can Germany become a unified, peaceful, and democratic country. If the German people and the German nation are to survive, they must defend the right to peacefully and democratically reunite and achieve this unity." Grotewohl emphasized that the patriotic forces of the German people themselves must play a decisive role in the struggle for German reunification.

Referring to the security measures in the Warsaw Treaty, Grotewohl mentioned that the other countries participating in the Warsaw Conference all have well-equipped armed forces, while the German Democratic Republic, apart from the People's Police, does not yet have armed forces. Organizing the national armed forces will create the necessary conditions for the German Democratic Republic to participate in the joint command.

Grotewohl finally mentioned the statement made by the representative of the People's Republic of China at the Warsaw Conference, saying that this statement will undoubtedly make a deep impression on the imperialist aggressors and the revanchists in West Germany.

    民主德国议院批准八国友好合作互助条约
    新华社柏林二十一日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院在二十日举行的第六次全体会议上，听取了格罗提渥总理所作的政府声明，并且一致批准了八国友好合作互助条约。
    格罗提渥总理在政府声明中说明友好合作互助条约的内容，并且指出：华沙条约是缓和国际紧张局势、保卫各国人民的和平和安全的工具，也是在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国统一的一个步骤。这个条约对于德意志民主共和国是一个新的力量的泉源。德意志民主共和国政府将不遗余力地继续为德国的和平、民主、统一而斗争。
    格罗提渥说：“华沙条约对欧洲以及德国的安全与和平有着直接的、积极的影响。只有废除了巴黎协定，德国才能够成为一个统一、和平和民主的国家。如果德国人民和德国民族要生存，它就必须保卫和平而民主地重新统一的权利，并且获致这种统一。”格罗提渥着重指出：德国人民的爱国力量本身必须在争取德国重新统一的斗争中，起决定性的作用。
    格罗提渥在谈到华沙条约中关于保障安全的措施时提到，参加华沙会议的其他国家都拥有装备良好的武装部队，只有德意志民主共和国除了有人民警察外，还没有武装部队。组织国家的武装部队将为德意志民主共和国参加联合司令部创造必需条件。
    格罗提渥最后提到中华人民共和国的代表在华沙会议上的声明，他说，这个声明将毫无疑问地给帝国主义侵略者以及西德的复仇主义者以极深的印象。
