　　No "Hats" Allowed to be Placed Randomly on Peasants
　　Zhong Xia
    Regardless of when, where, or what kind of work is being carried out, the method of coercion and command must not be used on the people. This is a principle that every revolutionary worker must adhere to. However, this bad work style of coercion and command is still very prevalent among many cadres. Arbitrarily "putting hats" on peasants is a disguised form of coercion and command.
    Here are a few prominent examples: The peasants in Zhangshui District, Yin County, Zhejiang Province, originally had the custom of renting out their draft cattle, but this year very few are renting them out. The main reason is that some cadres said that renting out cattle is "exploitation." The cattle owners felt that this "hat" was too unpleasant, and they would rather let the cattle idle at home than rent them out, which greatly affected the spring plowing production of peasants who lacked cattle. In Ding County, Hebei Province, some peasants requested to withdraw from the agricultural cooperatives. The village cadres said, "Do you want to take the capitalist road?" "Still want to stand out!" Some cadres even said that the peasants who requested to withdraw from the cooperative were "violating the Constitution," supposedly because the Constitution states that peasants should take the path of collectivization. As a result, some peasants who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative did not dare to request it. Similar incidents have occurred in Rongfeng County, Yunnan, and Xunyi County, Shaanxi: Some members of agricultural cooperatives, due to financial difficulties, wanted to engage in some sporadic sideline production in their spare time, but the cadres said that this was "spontaneous capitalist tendencies." With this "hat" placed on them, the impoverished peasants, despite their difficult lives, did not dare to engage in sideline production.
    "Spontaneous capitalist tendencies," "capitalism," "exploitation," "standing out"… These various "hats" have a great controlling effect on peasants. Peasants with high levels of awareness and an understanding of national policies are, of course, not afraid of these "hats." But peasants with low levels of awareness and a lack of understanding of policies are often intimidated by these "hats."
    Cadres who commit this kind of mistake, with the exception of a few who have particularly bad work styles, mostly do so because they are not familiar with the policies, do not know how to do mass work, and want to use this method of coercion and command to control the masses whenever they encounter difficulties in their work. In fact, they often do not understand the implications of the "hats" they are using.
    Effective measures must be taken to stop the spread of this bad work style. Policy education should be provided to grassroots cadres, so that they understand the spirit of the current policies, clarify the boundaries of the policies, and distinguish between what is permitted by the policies and what is not, what can be done and what cannot be done. At the same time, they must also be educated on the mass line, so that they understand the correct relationship between revolutionary cadres and the people, and understand that we can only persuade and educate the masses, and never coerce and command them. Of course, when educating grassroots cadres, it must also be made clear that it is also wrong not to criticize and educate peasants who violate state plans. This would foster the development of backward thinking among peasants and would also lead to alienation from the broad masses.
    Of course, sometimes higher-level authorities assign tasks that are too numerous and too heavy, with deadlines that are too tight and too urgent, leaving grassroots cadres at a loss and forcing them to adopt coercive methods. Higher-level authorities bear a major responsibility for the creation of this phenomenon. The correction of this phenomenon must also begin with higher-level authorities.

　　不许给农民乱“扣帽子”
　　仲夏
    不论在何时何地进行何种工作，都不能对人民群众采取强迫命令的办法，这是每一个革命工作者都必须遵守的原则。但是，强迫命令这种恶劣作风，在许多干部中还很流行。随便给农民“扣帽子”，就是强迫命令的一种变相的方式。
    这里举几个突出的例子：浙江鄞县樟水区的农民本来有出租耕牛的习惯，今年出租耕牛的却很少了。主要的原因是有些干部说出租耕牛是“剥削”，牛主觉得这个“帽子”太难听，宁愿让牛在家里闲着，也不愿出租，缺牛的农民的春耕生产因此受到很大影响。河北定县有些农民要求退出农业社，村干部说：“你想走资本主义道路？”“还想出去冒尖哩！”有些干部甚至说要求退社的农民“违反宪法”，据说是因为宪法上写着农民应走合作化的道路。这样，有些想退社的农民就不敢要求退社了。云南榕峰县、陕西栒邑县都发生过这样的事：有些农业社的社员因为生活困难，想抽空进行些零星的副业生产，干部就说这是“自发势力”，用这“帽子”一压，贫困的农民虽然生活困难，也不敢去进行副业生产了。
    “自发势力”、“资本主义”、“剥削”、
  “冒尖”………这些形形色色的“帽子”，对农民有很大的控制作用。觉悟高的、了解国家政策的农民，当然不怕这些“帽子”；但觉悟低的、不了解政策的农民，常常被这些“帽子”吓唬住。
    犯了这种毛病的干部，除少数作风特别恶劣的以外，大多数还是由于不熟悉政策，不会作群众工作，每当工作遇到困难，就想用这种强迫命令的办法来控制群众。其实，他们拿出这些“帽子”的含意究竟是什么，他们自己常常都不大懂得的。
    必须采取有效的措施，制止这种恶劣作风的流行。应该对基层干部进行政策教育，使他们懂得当前各种政策的精神，划清政策的界限，分清那些是政策允许的，那些是政策不允许的，那些可以做，那些不能做。同时，还必须对他们进行群众路线的教育，使他们懂得革命干部同人民群众之间的正确关系，懂得我们只能说服教育群众，绝不能强迫命令群众的道理。当然，在对基层干部进行教育的时候，同样要说清楚，对于农民违反国家计划的思想、行为，放弃批评教育也是不对的；这样就会助长农民落后思想的发展，同样会脱离广大群众。
    当然，有时上级机关分配任务过多过重，限期过苛过急，使基层干部无所适从，采取强迫命令的方法。这种现象的造成，上级机关要负重大的责任。这种现象的纠正，也要从上级机关开始。
