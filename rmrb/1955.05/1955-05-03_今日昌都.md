　　Qamdo is one of the fastest-growing cities on the Kham-Tibet Plateau. As soon as people pass the Yunnan Bridge on the outskirts of the city, they can see the newly built meteorological station. In the eastern part of the city, there are buildings for the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee Guest House and the Veterinary Hospital, as well as the new site for the People's Hospital. These buildings, along with the houses of the Kham-Tibet Highway Maintenance Engineering Office, the office building of the rear organs of the Tibet Military Region, and the houses of the United Stores, which were built one or two years ago, almost fill the triangular area between the Za Qu and Ang Qu rivers. Since the opening of the highway, the citizens have also built and renovated two or three hundred houses. The building foundation in the old city area is feeling more and more insufficient.

　　East of the Za Qu River, on the open Sichuan Dam, the auto repair shop and tall warehouses were built two years ago. The area of these houses and yards has exceeded the total area of the old city. Now, some offices and dormitories have been added, and the newly planted saplings have grown green leaves. West of the Ang Qu River, on the Yunnan Dam, there used to be only a lonely courtyard. Now, a row of frames has been erected here, and more than 500 Tibetan and Han workers are under construction. The total area of these buildings is more than 7,000 square meters, and they are the new sites for state-owned enterprises such as the People's Bank, the Trade Company, the Grain Company, and the Post and Telecommunications Bureau. A technician at the construction site pointed to the construction drawings and told us that the first row of houses in the new site of the Trade Company has twelve storefronts. Counters and cargo cabinets are located in the middle, which can accommodate more than 100 customers at the same time. According to the preliminary plan, opposite these state-owned enterprises will be a small park and square, followed by a residential area. After these buildings are completed, a new city area will be formed here.

　　At present, the most lively place is still the old city. Since the opening of the highway for more than two years, more than 200 stores have been added. The state-owned trade company's all-in-one department, which was only one store in 1954, has been divided into four this year. Since the beginning of spring, the shops selling tea and farm tools and purchasing local and special products have been crowded with farmers and herdsmen every day. According to the statistics of the Trade Company, more than 220,000 catties of tea have been wholesaled and retailed in the first quarter of this year, and more than 9,000 pieces of iron agricultural tools have been supplied to farmers. The purchased wool, fox fur, cordyceps, etc., are worth more than 30,000 yuan. Before the opening of the highway, one hundred catties of wool could only be exchanged for ten "zeng" of tea, and one catty of cordyceps could only be exchanged for four "fang" of khaki cloth; now one hundred catties of wool can be exchanged for nineteen "zeng" of tea, and one catty of cordyceps can be exchanged for ten "fang" of khaki cloth. Xinhua Bookstore has also recently added Tibetan books and periodicals and children's books department.

　　Since late March, the weather in Qamdo has become warmer and warmer. Before the rainy season arrives, construction workers are stepping up construction. Trucks loaded with bricks, tiles, and lime are driving to the construction site, and loggers are taking advantage of the good season when the ice and snow have melted and the floods have not yet arrived to float a large amount of wood from the upper reaches of the river. Before dawn or after dark, cars rumble through the suburbs. The tense season of transportation on the Kham-Tibet Highway has begun.

　　今日昌都
　　新华社记者　陈家璡　赵家烈
    昌都是康藏高原发展最快的城市之一。当人们一过了市郊的云南桥，就可以看到新修的气象站。市区东部，出现了昌都人民解放委员会招待所和兽医院的楼房、人民医院的新院址。这批建筑和一、两年以前建成的康藏公路养护工程处的房屋、西藏军区后方机关的办公楼、联合商店的房舍，几乎布满了杂曲、昂曲两河之间的三角地带。公路通车以后，市民们也新建和改修了二、三百间房屋。旧市区能建筑房屋的地基已感到越来越不够了。
      在杂曲河以东，空旷的四川坝上，两年以前就修起了汽车修理场场房和高大的仓库，这些房院的面积已超过了旧市区的总面积，如今又添了一些办公室和宿舍，新植的小树已长出了绿叶。昂曲河以西的云南坝上，过去只有一处孤独的院落，现在这里搭起了一片房架，五百多名藏、汉族工人正在施工。这批建筑物的总面积有七千多平方公尺，是人民银行、贸易公司、粮食公司、邮电局等国营企业的新址。工地上一个技术员指着施工图纸告诉我们说：贸易公司新址的第一排房子是十二间门市部，柜台和货橱设在中间，可以同时容纳一百多名顾客。按着初步制定的规划，这些国营企业的对面，是一个小型公园和广场，接着就是居民区。这些建筑完成后，这里就将形成一个新市区。
    目前，最热闹的地方还是旧市区。公路通车两年多来，商店增加了二百多家。一九五四年国营贸易公司一揽子的门市部，今年分成了四个门市部。从开春以来，出售茶叶、农具和收购土产特产的门市部，每天都挤满了农牧民。据贸易公司统计，今年第一季度批发和零售出去的茶叶有二十二万多斤，供应农民的铁质农具九千多件。收购的羊毛、狐皮、虫草等价值三万多元。公路通车前一百斤羊毛只换十甑茶叶，一斤虫草只换四方卡叽布；现在一百斤羊毛能换十九甑茶叶，一斤虫草能换十方卡叽布。新华书店最近也增设了藏文书刊和儿童读物门市部。
    三月下旬以来，昌都天气越来越暖，在雨季还没到来以前，建筑工人们正加紧施工。汽车满载着砖瓦、石灰驶向工地，伐木工人也趁着冰雪已消、洪水没到的好季节，把大量木料从河上游流送下来。黎明前或天黑后，汽车隆隆开过市郊。康藏公路运输紧张的季节开始了。
