Farmers in the paddy field areas of southern provinces are transplanting rice seedlings in a timely manner.

This newspaper reports that farmers in the paddy field areas of Yunnan, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces are beginning to transplant rice seedlings in a timely manner.

According to statistics from nine special districts including Simao and Yuxi in Yunnan Province, more than 560,000 mu of rice seedlings had been transplanted by May 10. In the Simao Special District, where the season is earlier, 76% of the paddy fields have been planted with rice seedlings. To ensure timely transplanting, the farmers of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province have increased the water storage capacity of the entire province by approximately 15% compared to the same period last year.

In Guangdong Province, after rainfall began on May 7, farmers in various locations seized the time to transplant rice seedlings intensively. The province has basically completed the transplanting of early rice on more than 30 million mu of land. During the transplanting process, various localities have rationally allocated labor resources nearby, organizing farmers who have completed transplanting and urban workers and residents to support the transplanting areas. In Xingning and Meixian, an average of 50,000 urban residents go to the countryside every day to support farmers in transplanting rice seedlings.

In Sichuan Province, farmers in the Luzhou and Yibin special districts along the Yangtze River, where the season is earlier, and in the Neijiang and Leshan special districts downstream of the Tuojiang and Minjiang Rivers, generally began transplanting rice seedlings from mid to late April. Farmers in the urban area of ​​Luzhou City, after transplanting more than 10,000 mu of early rice seedlings, are now fully engaged in transplanting mid-season rice.

Farmers in Xishui, Huangmei, Wuchang, Xiaogan, Yidu and other places in Hubei Province all began transplanting rice seedlings in early May. In Echeng County, the 7th and 8th districts, which started transplanting earlier, have basically completed. In the Xiangyang and Yichang special districts, counties such as Gucheng and Changyang, where the season is earlier, also began transplanting in early May. Around the 20th, farmers in most areas of Hubei Province will generally be transplanting rice seedlings.

In the lake areas of Hunan Province, continuous overcast and rainy weather in the second half of April generally delayed the transplanting period. Since the beginning of May, various localities have been plowing paddy fields to prevent rotten seedlings. Currently, transplanting has begun in some areas. In Yizhang, Lingxian, Hengshan, Jianghua and other places in southern Hunan, transplanting began in late April and early May, and some places have already completed transplanting.

As of May 12, Jiangxi Province had transplanted rice seedlings on 16 million mu of early rice fields, accounting for approximately 90% of the province's early rice transplanting plan. Among them, more than 1 million mu are single-season mid-season rice fields, late-season rice fields, and dry land that did not produce early rice in previous years. This year, farmers have responded to the call to change the cropping system and converted them into early rice fields.

Transplanting work has also begun in some areas of Anhui. In the Anqing Special District, seven counties including Susong and Tongcheng had transplanted more than 2 million mu of rice seedlings by the first ten days of May.

In Zhejiang Province, the transplanting of early rice and early-mid rice has basically ended in the coastal plains, eastern and southern hilly areas, and along the upper reaches of the Qiantang River. Early transplanted seedlings have begun to turn green. Local farmers are carrying out seedling field management work. The area of double-season early rice and single-season early rice in these areas accounts for more than half of the province's paddy fields. The coastal plain is the main area in Zhejiang Province this year for promoting intercropping rice to continuous cropping rice and single-season rice to double-season rice. In the Wenzhou and Ningbo special districts, approximately 800,000 mu of intercropping rice have been converted to continuous cropping rice. In order to strive for a bumper harvest in both seasons, the early rice transplanting time for these areas converting to continuous cropping rice and double-season rice has been advanced by about four to seven days compared to previous years.

　　南方水田地区农民及时插秧
    本报讯　云南、广东、四川、湖北、湖南、江西等省水田地区农民及时开始插秧。
    云南省据思茅、玉溪等九个专区统计，到五月十日止，共已插秧五十六万多亩，季节较早的思茅专区已有百分之七十六的水田插好了秧。云南省各族农民为保证按时插秧，今年全省蓄水量约比去年同期增加百分之十五以上。
    广东省从五月七日开始降雨后，各地农民抓紧时间紧张插秧。全省三千多万亩早稻田现已基本完成插秧工作。在插秧中，各地都就近合理地调配了劳动力，组织已插完秧的农民和城镇工人、居民支援插秧地区。兴宁、梅县城镇平均每天有五万居民下乡支援农民插秧。
    四川省沿长江两岸季节较早的泸州、宜宾等专区，沱江、岷江下游的内江、乐山专区的农民，从四月中、下旬起就普遍开始插秧。泸州市区农民插完一万多亩早秧后，现已全力转入栽插中稻。
    湖北省浠水、黄梅、武昌、孝感、宜都等地农民，都在五月初开始插秧。鄂城县插秧较早的七、八两区已基本结束。襄阳、宜昌两专区季节较早的谷城、长阳等县也在上旬开始插秧。二十日左右，湖北省大部地区农民将普遍插秧。
    湖南省滨湖地区，四月份下半月连续阴雨，插秧期一般都推迟了些。五月份开始以来，各地都在翻耕水田、防止烂秧。目前部分地区已开始栽插。湖南南部宜章、酃县、衡山、江华等地在四月底五月初就已开始插秧，有些地方已经插完。
    江西省到五月十二日止，已有一千六百万亩早稻田插上秧苗，占全省早稻插秧计划百分之九十左右。这里面有一百多万亩是往年不产早稻的一季中稻田、晚稻田和旱地，今年农民响应改变耕作制度的号召，把它们改成了早稻田。
    安徽部分地区插秧工作也已开始。安庆专区宿松、桐城等七县，五月上旬已插秧二百多万亩。
    浙江省沿海平原、东部和南部丘陵地带以及钱塘江上游两岸的早稻、早中稻插秧基本结束，早插秧苗已开始转青。当地农民正在进行秧田管理工作。这些地区的双季早稻和单季早稻的面积，占全省水稻田面积的一半以上；沿海平原，是今年浙江省推行间作稻改为连作稻和单季稻改为双季稻的主要地区。温州、宁波两个专区已有八十万亩左右的间作稻改为连作稻。为了争取两季都获得丰收，这些地区改连作稻和双季稻的早稻插秧时间，都比往年提前四天到七天左右。
