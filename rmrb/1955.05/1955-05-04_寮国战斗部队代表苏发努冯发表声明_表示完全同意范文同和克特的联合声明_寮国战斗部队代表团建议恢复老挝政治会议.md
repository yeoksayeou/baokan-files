Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 2nd -- Lao News: Prince Souphanouvong, representative of the Lao Fighting Units, issued a statement expressing full agreement with the joint statement issued by Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Katay, Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, in Bandung on April 23rd, and demanded that the political conference be resumed quickly.

Souphanouvong said that the Lao Fighting Units fully agreed that the political issues that the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units should seek to resolve in strictly and thoroughly implementing the Geneva Accords were internal to Laos and must be resolved directly by both parties. It was precisely in this spirit that the political delegations of the Lao Fighting Units and the Royal Lao Government held political conferences to find all solutions conducive to consolidating peace, realizing freedom and democracy, striving for the unification of Laos, and completing the independence and democracy of Laos. Souphanouvong pointed out that due to the difficulties and obstacles created by the Kingdom side, and the Royal Government delegation's lack of concern for discussing the sincere and reasonable proposals of the Lao Fighting Units delegation, the political conference was held for only eighteen days in three months and ten days, and was interrupted again on April 21st. On the contrary, the Lao Fighting Units delegation, during the past period, placed the interests of the motherland above all else, and expressed great patience and concessions, issued a joint statement with the Royal Government delegation on March 9th, concluded an agreement to guarantee the cessation of hostilities, and agreed to form a political consultative committee with an equal number of representatives from both sides to resolve the issue of national unification.

Souphanouvong further pointed out that after Prime Minister Katay and Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong issued a joint statement, the Lao Fighting Units delegation received a letter from the Royal Government stating that the Royal Government did not accept the suggestions of the Lao Fighting Units delegation and arbitrarily delayed the meeting. The letter also stated that the Lao Fighting Units delegation could either return to Sam Neua immediately or stay in Vientiane and wait for Prime Minister Katay to return before returning. The Lao Fighting Units believed that the Royal Government's attitude was not in accordance with the spirit of the Bandung joint statement.

Souphanouvong finally said that the Lao Fighting Units believed that for the sake of peace, for the supreme interests of the motherland and the Lao people, and in accordance with the Katay-Pham Van Dong joint statement, the Lao political conference must be convened quickly and negotiations must continue based on the principles of sincere and equal consultation and mutual respect between the two sides. If both sides show their sincerity and are based on mutual concessions, the political conference will definitely achieve a satisfactory result.

Xinhua News Agency report: The political delegation of the Lao Fighting Units wrote to the political delegation of the Royal Lao Government on April 28th, in reply to the letter from the Royal Lao Government on April 25th. The Royal Lao Government insisted in the letter that the suggestions put forward by the Lao Fighting Units delegation at the Lao political conference were illegal and unconstitutional and rejected them, thus interrupting the negotiations.

The Lao delegation suggested to the Royal Lao Government that negotiations be resumed. The letter said: We believe that if both sides demonstrate sincerity, equality, mutual respect and a spirit of reconciliation, our negotiations will achieve good results in accordance with the wishes of all the Lao people.

　　寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯发表声明
　　表示完全同意范文同和克特的联合声明
　　寮国战斗部队代表团建议恢复老挝政治会议
    新华社河内二日电　老挝消息：寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯亲王发表声明，表示完全同意越南民主共和国副总理兼外交部长范文同和老挝王国政府首相克特四月二十三日在万隆发表的联合声明，并要求迅速继续举行政治会议。
    苏发努冯说，寮国战斗部队完全同意，老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队在严格和彻底执行日内瓦协定时应当谋求解决的政治问题，是老挝内部的、而且须由双方直接解决的问题。正是根据这一精神，寮国战斗部队政治代表团和老挝王国政府政治代表团举行了政治会议，以便找出有利于巩固和平、实现自由民主、争取老挝的统一、完成老挝的独立和民主的一切解决办法。苏发努冯指出，由于王国方面所制造的困难和阻碍，以及王国政府代表团不关心讨论寮国战斗部队代表团的真诚合理的建议，从而使政治会议在三个月零十天中只举行了十八天会议，到四月二十一日会议又遭到中断。相反地，寮国战斗部队代表团在过去的期间，将祖国的利益放在一切之上，曾表示了十分的忍耐和让步，在三月九日同王国政府代表团发表了联合声明，缔结了保证停止敌对行动协议，并且同意组成双方代表人数相等的政治协商委员会来解决国家统一的问题。
    苏发努冯又指出，当克特首相和范文同副总理发表联合声明后，寮国战斗部队代表团又接到了王国政府方面的信，说王国政府不接受寮国战斗部队代表团的建议，并且擅自延搁了会议。信中还说，随便寮国战斗部队代表团马上回到桑怒去，或留在万象等到克特首相回来后再回去。寮国战斗部队认为王国政府这种态度是不符合万隆的联合声明的精神的。
    苏发努冯最后说，寮国战斗部队认为，为了和平，为了祖国和老挝人民的最高利益和符合克特—范文同的联合声明，老挝政治会议必须迅速召开，根据双方真诚平等协商和互相尊重的原则，继续谈判。如果双方都表示自己的诚意，以双方互相让步为基础，政治会议一定能获得圆满的结果。
    据新华社讯　寮国战斗部队政治代表团四月二十八日写信给老挝王国政府政治代表团，答复四月二十五日老挝王国政府的来信，老挝王国政府在信中硬说寮国战斗部队代表团在老挝政治会议上提出的建议是非法和违宪的而加以拒绝，因而中断了谈判。
    寮国代表团向老挝王国政府建议恢复谈判。并在信中说：我们相信，如果双方表现出真诚、平等、互相尊重和和解的精神，我们的谈判将能符合全体老挝人民的愿望而取得良好的成就。
