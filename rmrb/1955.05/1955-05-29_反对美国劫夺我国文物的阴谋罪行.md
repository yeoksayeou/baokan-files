　　After this newspaper exposed the American conspiracy to plunder our precious cultural relics in Taiwan on May 8th, many readers sent letters denouncing this thieving conspiracy and continuing to reveal the facts of the past when American imperialism plundered precious cultural relics in our country.
　　Han Wanshou, who has worked at the Beijing Library for forty years, recalled sadly in his letter: "American aggressors stole as many as 2,900 kinds of rare books from the Beijing Library (now stored in the Library of Congress in the United States) in one instance in 1941 alone." He Heren (of the Naxi ethnic group), a cadre at the Central Institute for Nationalities, wrote: "As early as thirty years ago, American aggressors sent a special agent named Rock (also known as Joseph Rock, an American) under the guise of biological research, successively stealing more than 4,000 volumes of our Mosuo classics, as well as Buddhist statues, ritual instruments, and other precious ethnic cultural relics from our hometown—Lijiang, Yunnan." Ren Xingjian, Ouyang Daoda, Li Hongqing, Wang Chao, Zhang Jinghua, Chen Jichang, Shan Shiyuan, Dan Yuan Kui, Zhang Deze and other staff members of the Palace Museum jointly wrote: "There are 2,972 boxes of cultural relics from the Palace Museum now in Taiwan. Among them, the calligraphy and painting section includes the works of famous artists from the Tang, Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties, totaling more than 4,000 pieces. The bronzes are all treasures from the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties, such as the San Shi Pan, the Zong Zhou Zhong, and the Xin Jia Liang, which are indispensable objects for studying the institutions of that era. Most of the porcelains are famous kiln products from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, as well as thousands of famous porcelains collected in the Jingyang Palace and Jingqi Pavilion. In addition, there are no less than 300 pieces of enamel porcelains from the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong periods (commonly known as Guyuexuan). In terms of books, there are the Siku Quanshu of Wenyuan Pavilion, the Siku Huiyao of Chizao Hall, and carved and copied books from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, totaling more than 140,000 volumes. Among them, the Tianlu Linlang series are mostly printed editions from the Northern Song Dynasty; and the 1,500 types of local chronicles are mostly compiled in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. The old Manchu archives and the national letters of Kangxi and Roman envoys are important historical materials related to the politics and diplomacy of the Qing Dynasty; the historical materials of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution and the documentary evidence of Puyi's restoration are rare materials for studying modern Chinese history. In addition, there are 20 boxes of jewelry, the value of which is inestimable.

　　Zhou Qinjie of the Ministry of Foreign Trade wrote: "The so-called 'long-term loan' by American imperialist elements is actually an attempt to use the name of 'loan' to plunder this batch of historical relics to the United States and seize them forever." Wa Qierzhabu (Mongolian) and other twelve graduating students from Beijing University of Political Science and Law jointly pointed out: "The American aggressors want to plunder the brilliant cultural treasures left by our ancestors to the United States to decorate their facade and flaunt civilization. This is the most uncivilized and barbarous act." Li Chengsheng of the Ministry of Fuel Industry and Kang Ling, a student of the Affiliated Girls' Middle School of Beijing Normal University, wrote: The American's shameless act fully exposes its extreme fear of the Chinese people's just action to liberate Taiwan, and also shows that it is unwilling to return this treasure of the Chinese people to the hands of the people themselves.

　　Many readers emphasized in their letters that the precious cultural relics in Taiwan that the United States is trying to plunder are the crystallization of the labor and wisdom of our working people for thousands of years, and are the precious property of our 600 million people. The Chinese people must recover these treasures that were stolen to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and will never allow American imperialism to plunder them. Bo Songnian and other twenty-four students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts said excitedly in their letter: "We are art workers who are about to graduate from school, and we deeply know the great artistic value of the hard work of artists of the past generations. These precious cultural relics are connected to our great motherland and 600 million Chinese people by flesh and blood. We will never allow American imperialists to touch it." All postgraduate students of the painting department of the school said: "We love these cultural relics as much as we love our motherland, and it and Taiwan are inseparable from the motherland." Teachers and all second- and third-year students of the archeology major of the history department of Peking University said: "American imperialists must stop all conspiracy activities attempting to plunder these precious cultural relics." Chen Enhui and others from the Beijing Library said: "We are library workers and have a major responsibility for protecting national cultural relics and books. We must recover all the cultural relics of the motherland! Even if we chase them to the ends of the earth!" Many library and archeological workers and archeology students in schools have written to express their firm support for the joint statement issued by the staff of our cultural relics agencies on May 14, and resolutely oppose the American conspiracy to plunder our precious cultural relics in Taiwan.

　　Many readers pointed out in their letters that Taiwan is our territory and we must liberate it. As long as Taiwan is not liberated, the safety and property of the people of the motherland will be threatened. They firmly stated that they will take practical actions of actively working and studying hard to support the struggle of the people of the motherland to liberate Taiwan, strive for the early liberation of Taiwan, and completely smash the conspiracy of the American imperialists!

　　反对美国劫夺我国文物的阴谋罪行
    五月八日本报揭露美国企图劫夺在台湾的我国珍贵文物的罪行后，不少读者纷纷来信，痛斥美国这种盗窃阴谋，并继续揭发美帝国主义过去在我国劫掠珍贵文物的事实。
    在北京图书馆工作了四十年的韩万寿，在来信中沉痛地回忆说：“美国侵略者单在一九四一年曾一次盗走北京图书馆所保藏的善本书达两千九百多种（现存美国国会图书馆）。”中央民族学院干部和即仁（纳西族）来信说：“美国侵略者远在三十年前就派遣了特务分子罗克（又名罗约瑟，美国人）以研究生物为名，先后在我们的家乡——云南丽江盗走我麽些经典四千余部，以及佛像法器等珍贵的民族文物多种。”故宫博物院工作人员任行建、欧阳道达、李鸿庆、王超、张景华、陈吉昌、单士元、单元奎、张德则等联名来信说：“故宫的文物现在台湾的共有二千九百七十二箱。其中书画部分，自唐宋以迄明清的名家作品，应有尽有，计四千余件。铜器都是三代珍品，如散氏盘、宗周钟、新嘉量等，更是研究一代制度所不可缺少的实物。瓷器大部分是宋、元、明历代的名窑产品以及景阳宫、景祺阁两处旧藏历代名瓷数千件之多，此外还有康（熙）雍（正）乾（隆）的珐琅彩瓷（通称古月轩），不下三百余件。图书方面，有文渊阁四库全书、摛藻堂四库荟要和宋元明历朝刻本、钞本等，共十四万余册。其中天禄琳琅丛书，且多北宋刊本；而方志一千五百余种，则多为明末清初所修纂。档案中的老满文档和康熙与罗马使节国书等，是有关清代政治、外交的重要史料；太平天国革命史料和溥仪复辟的文证，更是研究我国近代史的稀有资料。此外，还有珠宝二十箱，其价值是无法可以估计的。
    对外贸易部周勤杰来信说：“美帝国主义分子的所谓‘长期出借’的说法，实际上就是想假用 ‘出借’的名义把这批历史文物劫运到美国去，永远攫为己有。”北京政法学院应届毕业学生瓦琪尔扎布（蒙族）等十二人联名来信指出：“美国侵略者想把我国祖先遗留下来的光辉灿烂的文化宝藏劫运到美国去为自己装饰门面，标榜文明，这是最不文明、最野蛮的暴行。”燃料工业部李澄生和北京师范大学附属女子中学学生康玲来信指出：美国这一无耻勾当充分暴露它对中国人民解放台湾的正义行动是极端害怕的，同时也说明了它不愿意这批中国人民的宝藏返回人民自己的手里。
    许多读者在来信中强调指出，美国企图劫夺的我国在台湾的这些珍贵文物是我国劳动人民几千年来劳动和智慧的结晶，是我国六亿人民的珍贵财产，中国人民一定要收回这些被蒋介石卖国集团盗运到台湾去的宝藏，绝不容许美帝国主义掠夺。中央美术学院薄松年等二十四位学生在来信中激动地说：“我们是即将从学校毕业的美术工作者，我们深深知道历代艺术家们辛勤劳动成果的伟大艺术价值。这些珍贵文物是同我们伟大祖国和六亿中国人民血肉相连的，绝不容许美帝国主义者动它一下。”该校绘画系全体研究生说：“我们深爱这些文物，正像我们深爱祖国一样，它和台湾同样是同祖国不可分割的。”北京大学历史系考古专业教师和二、三年级全体学生表示说：“美帝国主义者必须停止企图劫掠这些珍贵文物的一切阴谋活动。”北京图书馆陈恩惠等说：“我们是图书馆工作者，对于保护国家文物图书，是负有重大责任的。我们一定要追回祖国的一切文物！那怕是追到天涯海角！”许多图书馆和考古工作人员、学校里考古专业的学生纷纷来信表示他们坚决拥护和支持我国文物机关工作人员五月十四日联合发表的声明，坚决反对美国阴谋劫夺我国在台湾的珍贵文物。
    许多读者在来信中指出，台湾是我国的领土，我们一定要解放。台湾一天不解放，祖国人民的安全和财产就一天受到威胁。他们坚决表示，要以积极工作、努力学习的实际行动来支援祖国人民解放台湾的斗争，争取早日解放台湾，彻底粉碎美帝国主义者的阴谋！
