Implementing the Policy of Focusing on Key Construction

　　Industrial capital construction, especially the industrial construction centered on the 156 enterprises designed with the help of the Soviet Union, is the core and focus of my country's first Five-Year Plan. We must concentrate our efforts to ensure the completion of these projects as scheduled. These enterprises are enterprises that produce means of production, are large-scale enterprises equipped with modern technology, and some of them are new industrial sectors that my country has never had before, or industries that existed in the past but whose production capacity is far from meeting the needs. When we build these enterprises, we will be able to rely on our own strength to manufacture various means of production needed to develop the national economy, to technically transform and further develop agriculture, light industry, and transportation, and to strengthen national defense capabilities. These enterprises will become the material foundation of a socialist society and a source of continuous improvement in the people's material and cultural life.
    However, building these enterprises is not an easy task. It requires a lot of funds, equipment, and technical forces. For example, to build a steel complex with an annual output of 1.5 million tons, it requires an investment of 1.8 billion to 2 billion yuan, 150,000 tons of equipment, 3,000 to 4,000 people to design for six or seven years, and 18,000 to 20,000 people to construct for six years. The manpower required for resource exploration is not included. However, my country's original economic foundation is weak, technology is backward, and although there is strong assistance from the Soviet Union and the people of the whole country are working hard to increase production and practice economy, the accumulated funds are limited, the technical force is insufficient, and the manufacturing capacity of equipment is far from meeting the needs. Therefore, on the one hand, we must actively further tap potential, overcome difficulties, and strive to accumulate more funds on the existing basis, train more talents, and ensure the materials and equipment needed for these projects; on the other hand, we must also correctly use existing forces, especially rationally and economically use the accumulated funds.
    There are two ways to use existing forces and accumulated funds. One is to use them in a scattered manner, regardless of priorities, in order to meet current needs, build more textile factories, import more cotton, build more roads, buy more cars and gasoline, build more cinemas, theaters, and parks, and so on. If this approach is adopted, the strength of key construction will be weakened, and the number of key projects will have to be reduced or postponed. Without these enterprises, it would mean a reduction in the scale of social expanded reproduction, a slowdown in the speed of development, a failure to rapidly strengthen national defense, and a prolonged socialist construction process. This approach is obviously contrary to the long-term and fundamental interests of the people of the whole country. The other method is to concentrate the main forces on building key projects first, and to develop other economic and cultural constructions that are indispensable to ensure heavy industrial construction in proportion. Other constructions other than these will be temporarily put aside. If we adopt this approach, we will be able to guarantee the completion of these key projects according to the established plan, and lay a preliminary foundation for my country's socialist industrialization during the first Five-Year Plan period.
    Starting from the long-term interests of the people of the whole country, the road we choose is of course the latter rather than the former. Although choosing this path may encounter many difficulties, we are willing to endure temporary hardships and can overcome the various difficulties we encounter.
    We have been following this path for the past two years. In the past two years of industrial investment, investment in the means of production sector accounted for 82.2 percent, and investment in the consumer goods sector accounted for only 17.8 percent. The allocation of technical forces and the production and supply of materials and equipment are also prioritized for key projects. Therefore, we have built enterprises such as the Anshan Large Steel Rolling Mill, the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, and the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant, which are of great significance to the national economy, and have started the construction of important projects such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Tractor Manufacturing Plant. These facts prove that it is correct, necessary, and possible to practice economy and implement the policy of focusing on key construction. At the same time, the practice of the past two years has also proved that this policy is supported by the broad masses of the people.
    However, can we say that we have a deep understanding of the basic policy of implementing key construction and practicing economy to realize socialist industrialization? We cannot say that. Although we have repeatedly opposed the erroneous ideas of blind advancement and decentralized funds in capital construction that hinder key construction in the past two years, these erroneous ideas have not been completely overcome. Too many non-key projects are still being built, the phenomenon of decentralized use and waste of state funds is still very serious, and the idea of economic accounting has not been seriously established among various economic workers.
    On the key issues of industrial construction, some comrades believe that since socialist industrialization is to be implemented, there is no need to distinguish between priorities, regardless of specific conditions, and regardless of whether it is in line with the national construction policy, as long as factories are built, "industrialization" can be realized. These comrades do not understand that the construction of light industrial factories alone cannot achieve industrialization, because light industrial products can only be consumed, cannot be used to expand production, cannot produce new factories, and cannot transform agriculture and transportation. Secondly, the random establishment of some heavy industrial enterprises cannot achieve industrialization either. Because industry is a whole, including various departments built according to a certain proportion to cooperate with each other, so that social productive forces can develop comprehensively and balancedly. If we do not comply with the laws of the planned and proportionate development of the national economy and blindly build some isolated enterprises, the result will not be able to play a role, but will form a waste. For example, the construction of the Huangtankou Hydropower Station in Zhejiang Province initially only saw that local water resources could be utilized, but did not carefully consider who would use the electricity generated after the project was completed. As a result, it cost more than 20 million yuan, and it has not yet been completed, and it was forced to stop construction, and it will cost a lot of money to maintain it. Such blind construction is of course not the same as the policy of focusing on key construction.
    At the same time, on the relationship between newly built and utilized existing enterprises, some comrades only pay attention to new industrial construction and neglect the possibility of utilizing existing small and medium-sized enterprises; or they believe that since the state needs new products, new factories must be built, without studying whether existing factories can be used, and how to use existing factories to produce new products needed by the state, so there have been some unreasonable phenomena in which some new ones are built and the old ones are squeezed, and the big ones are built and the small ones are squeezed. For example, the production of wires and cables in Shanghai, Tianjin and other places already has a certain foundation, but the Shenyang Cable Factory has carried out a very large expansion project. After it is completed, either the equipment capacity of the newly built cable factory cannot be fully utilized, or the national wire and cable products will be overstocked, and other old factories will have to reduce production. This approach not only disperses the accumulated funds, but also reduces the original source of accumulation, which is contrary to the policy of focusing on key construction.
    Also, on the issue of non-productive construction, some comrades believe that since modern industrial enterprises are to be built, other non-productive construction and welfare facilities must also be "modernized", otherwise it seems "incompatible", so there has been a phenomenon of excessive and excessively high standards of non-productive construction that deviates from my country's current economic level and the people's living standards. Taking the six central industrial ministries as an example, the non-productive investment in 1953 and 1954 was as high as 24.9 percent. In the Soviet Union, during the first Five-Year Plan period, non-productive investment in the industrial sector accounted for only 14.5 percent. According to statistics from 23 provinces and cities, productive investment accounted for 52.4 percent of our local capital construction investment in 1954, while non-productive investment accounted for 47.6 percent. Those who advocate that non-productive facilities should also be "modernized" have forgotten that the purpose of our construction of key projects is to increase production capacity and produce new products that cannot be manufactured with existing equipment. The so-called key point also refers to the productive construction part. This part of the construction requires a large amount of capital investment, but this is only limited to the technical necessity of large-scale production. That is to say, first, these modern and technically extremely complex production enterprises must be built with a large amount of capital; second, the large amount of capital used in the construction of these enterprises will be repaid to the state soon after the enterprises are put into production, and will also accumulate new and larger amounts of capital for the state; third, even so, any waste, any unnecessary, unreasonable, and deliberately spending more money is not allowed in the construction process of these enterprises. As for non-productive construction, such as offices, dormitories, public welfare facilities, etc., are built to ensure production, serve production, and are subordinate to production. It does not produce value itself, let alone "large-scale" production of value, so there is no special reason to pay attention to "modernization" technology, so this part must be simplified and must spend as little money as possible. Of course, we are different from the bourgeoisie, and we fully take care of the lives and welfare of the workers. But this kind of care should conform to the current economic level of the country and the living standards of the people, and should be subject to long-term interests. If we do not clarify these principles, or hold one-sided "mass viewpoints", or get stained with the extravagant and wasteful style of rich young masters, the result will also seriously disperse the strength of constructing key projects, and the buildings constructed in this way are often unaffordable and uncomfortable for the workers, and do not conform to the interests of the workers.
    All of the above facts show that the question of what is socialist industrialization and how to realize socialist industrialization has not been clearly resolved in the past. This situation puts forward a task for us: we must repeatedly and deeply further publicize and explain to all staff members and all the people, explain the great relationship between key projects and the destiny of the country and the happiness of the people, and explain the necessity of adopting the policy of focusing on key construction and practicing economy, so that everyone can support this policy from the overall perspective and long-term interests, and is willing to fight for the implementation of this policy. On this basis, launching a struggle against all departmentalism, decentralization, extravagance and waste, and the ideological style of liking the new and disliking the old will be more powerful; the inspection and supervision of the use of funds and technical forces will be more extensive and in-depth. In this way, with the support and supervision of the masses, coupled with the strict review and control of the construction plan by the leading organs at all levels, the policy of concentrating the main forces on the construction of heavy industry will be able to be implemented smoothly, and the success of the core of the first Five-Year Plan - the construction of heavy industry will have the most important guarantee.

### 贯彻重点建设的方针

　　贯彻重点建设的方针
    工业的基本建设，特别是以苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六个企业为中心的工业建设，是我国第一个五年计划的中心和重点。我们必须集中力量，保证如期完成这些工程。这些企业是生产生产资料的企业，是规模巨大的、用现代技术装备的企业，其中有些是我国过去从来没有过的新工业部门，或者是过去虽有但生产能力远远赶不上需要的工业。我们把这些企业建设起来，就能够依靠自己的力量制造发展国民经济所需要的各种生产资料，就能够从技术上改造和进一步发展农业、轻工业和交通运输业，也就能够增强国防力量。这些企业将成为社会主义社会的物质基础，成为人民物质文化生活不断高涨的泉源。
    但是，建设这些企业，并不是一件容易的事。它需要大量的资金、设备和技术力量。例如建设一个年产一百五十万吨规模的钢铁联合企业，就需要十八亿到二十亿元的投资，十五万吨重的设备，需要三千到四千人设计六七年，一万八千到两万人施工六年。资源勘探所需的人力还不在内。而我国原有的经济基础薄弱，技术落后，虽然有苏联的大力援助和全国人民努力增产节约，但积累起来的资金是有限度的，技术力量是不足的，设备的制造能力也远远赶不上需要。因此，我们一方面要积极地进一步挖掘潜力，克服困难，力求在现有基础上积累更多的资金，培养更多的人材，保证这些工程所需要的材料设备；一方面还必须正确地使用现有的力量，特别是合理地节约地使用积累起来的资金。
    现有的力量，已经积累起来的资金，有两种使用方法。一种是不分轻重缓急，分散使用，为了满足目前的需要，多盖一些纺织厂、多进口一些棉花，多修些公路、多买些汽车、汽油，多修些电影院、剧场和公园等等。采取这种做法，重点建设的力量就要削弱，重点工程的项目就得减少或推迟。而没有这些企业，就意味着社会扩大再生产的规模缩小，速度降低，国防力量不能迅速加强，社会主义建设过程延长。这种做法显然是同全国人民的长远利益和根本利益相违背的。另一种方法是集中主要力量首先建设重点工程，并按照比例地发展为保证重工业建设所不可缺少的其他经济的和文化的建设，除此以外的建设则暂时放下不办。采取这种做法，我们就能够保证按照既定计划建成这些重点工程，在第一个五年计划期间为我国的社会主义工业化奠定初步的基础。
    从全国人民的长远利益出发，我们选择的道路当然是后者而不是前者。虽然选择这条道路可能碰到很多困难，但是我们愿意忍受暂时的艰苦，并且能够克服所要碰到的各种困难。
    两年来，我们就是沿着这条道路走过来的。在过去两年的工业投资当中，生产资料部门的投资占百分之八十二点二，消费资料部门的投资只占百分之十七点八。技术力量的分配，材料设备的生产供应，也都是重点工程占优先地位。因此我们就建成了像鞍山大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、沈阳风动工具厂等对国民经济有重大意义的企业，开始进行了第一汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂等重要工程的建设。这些事实证明，厉行节约，贯彻重点建设的方针是正确的，是必要的和可能的。同时，两年来的实践也证明，这个方针是得到广大人民的支持的。
    但是，能不能说我们对于贯彻重点建设和厉行节约这个实现社会主义工业化的基本方针已经体会得很深刻了呢？不能这么说。虽然过去两年我们一再地反对了基本建设当中的盲目冒进，分散资金等妨碍重点建设的错误思想，但这种错误思想并没有被彻底克服。非重点的工程仍然建设得过多，分散使用和浪费国家资金的现象仍然十分严重，经济核算的思想还没有在各种经济工作人员中认真地树立起来。
    在工业建设的重点问题上，有的同志认为既要实行社会主义工业化，就可以不分轻重缓急，不问具体条件，也不问是否符合于国家建设方针，只要把工厂建设起来，就可以实现“工业化”。这些同志不了解只建设轻工业工厂是不能实现工业化的，因为轻工业的产品只能消费，不能用来扩大生产，不能产生新的工厂，更不能改造农业和交通运输业。其次，随便建立一些重工业企业，也是不能实现工业化的。因为工业是一个整体，其中包括按照一定比例建设起来的互相配合的各个部门，这样，社会生产力才能全面地平衡地向前发展。如果不遵守国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律，盲目地建设一些孤立的企业，结果也不能发挥作用，反而形成浪费。例如，浙江黄坛口水电站的建设，开始只看到当地的水利资源可以利用，但没有很好地考虑工程建成后发出电力给谁使用，结果花了二千多万元，还没有修完，不得不被迫停止修建，而且还要用很多钱来维护它。类似这种盲目建设的做法，当然和重点建设的方针是没有相同之处的。
    同时，在新建和利用原有企业的关系问题上，有的同志只注意新工业建设而忽视尽可能地利用旧有的中小企业；或者认为国家既然需要新的产品，就必须建设新的工厂，而不去研究是否可以利用原有的工厂，以及如何利用原有的工厂来生产国家所需要的新产品，因而就发生了某些建了新的、挤了旧的，建了大的、挤了小的的不合理现象。例如上海和天津等地的电线生产本来已有一定基础，但沈阳电线厂又进行了很大的扩建工程。等到建成之后，不是新建电线厂的设备能力不能充分发挥，就是全国的电线产品要积压，其他旧厂要减产。这种做法既分散了积累起来的资金，又缩小了原有的积累来源，和重点建设的方针也是背道而驰的。
    还有，在非生产性的建设问题上，有的同志认为既要建设现代化的工业企业，那末，其他非生产性的建设和福利设施也就必须“现代化”，否则就似乎
  “不相称”，因此就发生了脱离我国现在的经济水平和人民生活水平的非生产性的建设过多、标准过高的现象。以中央六个工业部来说，一九五三、一九五四两年非生产性的投资高达百分之二十四点九。而苏联在第一个五年计划时期，工业部门的非生产性投资只占百分之十四点五。根据二十三个省市的统计，我们在一九五四年的地方基本建设投资中，生产性的投资占百分之五十二点四，而非生产投资则占百分之四十七点六。这种主张非生产性设施也应该“现代化”的人，忘记了我们建设重点工程的目的是为了增加生产能力和出产依靠现有设备不能制造的新产品。所谓重点也就是指生产性建设这一部分。这部分建设是需要投入大量资金的，但这只是限于大规模生产的技术上的必要。这就是说，第一，这些现代化的技术上极其复杂的生产企业必须用大量资金才能建成；第二，这些企业建设时所用的大量资金在企业投入生产以后不久就会偿还国家，而且还会给国家积累新的更大量的资金；第三，即使这样，这些企业的建设过程中也决不允许有任何浪费，任何不必要地不合理地故意地多花钱的情形。至于非生产性的建设，如办公室、宿舍、公共福利设施等，是为了保证生产而建设的，是服务于生产、从属于生产的，它本身并不生产价值，更谈不到“大规模”地生产价值，因此没有特别讲究“现代化”技术的理由，所以这一部分必须从简，必须尽可能少花钱。当然，我们同资产阶级不同，我们是充分照顾职工的生活福利的。但是这种照顾要符合目前国家的经济水平和人民的生活水平，要服从于长远的利益。如果不弄清这些道理，或者抱着片面的“群众观点”，或者沾染了铺张浪费的阔少爷作风，结果也严重地分散了建设重点工程的力量，而且这样建设起来的建筑物对于职工来说还往往住不起，不好住，并不符合职工的利益。
    所有以上这些事实都说明，什么是社会主义工业化和如何实现社会主义工业化的问题，我们过去并不是都已经明确解决了的。这种状况就给我们提出了一个任务：必须反复地深入地进一步向全体工作人员、全体人民宣传解释，说明重点工程对国家命运、对人民幸福的重大关系，说明采取重点建设、厉行节约的方针的必要性，使大家都能从全局观点和长远利益出发，支持这个方针，愿意为贯彻这个方针而奋斗。在这个基础上，向一切本位主义、分散现象、铺张浪费、喜新厌旧的思想作风展开斗争，就会更加有力；对资金和技术力量等使用情况的检查和监督，就会更加广泛而深入。这样，有了群众的支持和监督，再加上各级领导机关对建设计划的严格审查和控制，集中主要力量建设重工业的方针就一定能够顺利地贯彻，第一个五年计划的核心——重工业建设的成功也就有了最重要的保证。
