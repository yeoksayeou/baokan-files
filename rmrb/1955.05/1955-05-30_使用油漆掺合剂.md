Paint has a wide range of uses; it can be used to coat components, doors, and windows in buildings, as well as everyday items such as tables, chairs, and beds. Saving paint is of universal significance.

According to advanced Soviet experience, using paint extender can save a significant amount of paint. Paint extender is a light yellow or cream-colored emulsion made from five jin of inexpensive quicklime, half a jin of salt, fifty kilograms of water, 0.75 kilograms of white clay powder, and three kilograms of Aleif oil or green oil. After adding pigment, it becomes a cloudy liquid of various colors. Using it to paint daily necessities or buildings instead of paint can reduce costs by 40%, with the same quality as paint. In July 1954, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant used it in a trial on the painting of metal structures, saving about 10,000 yuan. From July to November, it was fully promoted at several construction sites, saving more than 75,000 yuan. The achievements of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant show that if paint extender is promoted nationwide, the amount of funds that can be saved each year will be very large.

    油漆的用途很广，它可以涂刷建筑物中的构件、门窗，也可以涂刷日常用具如桌、椅、床等。节约使用油漆，是具有普遍意义的。
    根据苏联的先进经验，使用油漆掺合剂，可以节约大量的油漆。油漆掺合剂是利用价钱低廉的生石灰五斤，食盐半斤、水五十公斤、白土粉○·七五公斤、阿立夫油或青油三公斤配制成的清黄色乳浊液或奶油色乳浊液。加颜料后，即成为各种颜色的浊液。用以代替油漆涂刷日用品或建筑物，可降低成本百分之四十，质量和油漆涂刷的相同。一九五四年七月第一汽车制造厂在金属结构的油漆工程中试用，节省了一万元左右，七月至十一月份在几个工地全面推广，节省了七万五千余元。第一汽车制造厂的成绩说明，如果在全国范围内推广油漆掺合剂，每年能够节约的资金数目将是很大的。
