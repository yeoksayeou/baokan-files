Cannot Neglect Leadership of Mutual Aid Teams

In the current agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, a situation should attract people's attention. That is, agricultural producers' cooperatives have developed, but mutual aid teams in many regions have been weakened. While rectifying and consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives, earnestly strengthening leadership over mutual aid teams is both extremely urgent and necessary for the healthy development of the current spring plowing production and future mutual aid and cooperation movement.

With the development of the cooperative movement, mutual aid organizations in some areas have also developed to a certain extent. However, in a considerable number of areas, the backbone of the original mutual aid teams joined the cooperatives, and the leadership strength suddenly weakened, generally showing a state of disintegration. Some groups did not implement the principle of equal value exchange and mutual benefit, and the evaluation of work and calculation of value were unreasonable; some groups failed to clear work and settle accounts for a long time, affecting the labor enthusiasm of the members, and some slowly collapsed. In some areas, after large-scale development of cooperatives, the remaining middle peasants and poor peasants formed mutual aid teams separately, and many farmers with production difficulties were excluded from the mutual aid teams. In some areas, Party members and members of the Communist Youth League in mutual aid teams joined the cooperatives, and rich peasant elements and counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to usurp the leadership of the mutual aid teams, distorting the Party's policy of mutual aid and cooperation, causing serious organizational confusion and impure composition. Not long ago, a survey of mutual aid teams in Jianli, Huangpi and other counties in Hubei Province found that groups with organizational disarray and many problems accounted for more than 50 percent; groups with fewer problems, basically consolidated, and groups that had collapsed and disbanded each accounted for more than 20 percent. This situation is general. That is to say, except for a few areas where the movement is developing normally, most of the existing mutual aid teams have various problems to varying degrees. Many individual farmers are urgently demanding to organize mutual aid in the tense season of spring plowing production, but no one is leading them.

Mutual aid teams are an important foundation for agricultural producers' cooperatives. In the process of establishing cooperatives, some mutual aid teams directly transformed into cooperatives, and some members joined the cooperatives separately and successively. This kind of development and change is inevitable and normal, and it is impossible to imagine a mutual aid team that never changes. Some rural workers lack a comprehensive view of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and cannot correctly understand the relationship between mutual aid teams and cooperatives, believing that mutual aid teams are a lower form of mutual aid and cooperation organization, and now that there are cooperatives, they have become an "outdated thing." Therefore, they used the method of "extracting tendons and pulling bones" to concentrate the backbone of several mutual aid teams to run a cooperative, and then the phenomenon of "building a cooperative, dismantling a mutual aid team, and increasing individual households" occurred.

Cooperatives are the direction in which mutual aid teams advance, and mutual aid teams are the foundation for the development of cooperatives. This relationship has been proven by years of experience. Twenty agricultural producers' cooperatives in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, are not doing well, and one of the important reasons is that the mutual aid foundation at the time of establishing the cooperatives was not good, and the leading backbone and mass experience were lacking sufficient preparation. Of course, under certain conditions, individual farmers can also directly establish cooperatives; however, from mutual aid teams to cooperatives is the general law of development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Eighty to ninety percent of the existing cooperatives in our country have been established on the basis of mutual aid teams. In recent years, various localities have created the experience of "preparing throughout the year and developing in batches" of cooperatives. The so-called "preparation," in addition to the planning and arrangement of the leading organs and the training of backbone elements, the most important thing is to run mutual aid teams well. Only by running mutual aid teams well can we prepare the necessary leading backbone and preliminary experience and habits of collective labor for the cooperatives. Otherwise, if there is no foundation for mutual aid teams, developing cooperatives rashly, grabbing them temporarily, and leaping forward, it is inevitable to take a detour. It should be said that truly valuing cooperatives means never neglecting mutual aid teams. Whoever neglects mutual aid teams does not truly value cooperatives.

From the perspective of developing production, mutual aid teams should also be valued. Although cooperatives have now developed greatly, the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounts for only 13 percent of the total number of peasant households in the country; while the peasant households organized in various mutual aid teams account for about 50 percent, many of whom are middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants with greater production potential. Except for a few old liberated areas that have basically been cooperativized, mutual aid teams are still an important organizational form of agricultural production in the country for a considerable period of time. Grasping cooperatives tightly and relaxing mutual aid teams is actually grasping the few (although they are advanced) and losing the majority. How can this guarantee the realization of production plans nationwide? This year's agricultural production tasks are very arduous, and this year's production preparation work is not as good as in previous years in a considerable part of the region. Therefore, it is a very important task to carry out a comprehensive production increase movement centered on cooperatives and driving the vast number of mutual aid teams and individual farmers. If all the leading energy is concentrated on cooperatives and the leadership of mutual aid teams, which account for more than half of the farmers, is abandoned, it will cause irreparable losses in production.

From the perspective of the progress of the cooperative movement, agricultural producers' cooperatives with partial collective ownership have indeed made great progress, and more and more farmers are willing to join the cooperatives. However, a large number of farmers, especially middle peasants who own more means of production, are still wavering and waiting and watching, and there is no trend of joining the cooperatives in large numbers. For these farmers, on the one hand, we must patiently wait for their awareness, and at the same time, we must actively educate and guide them. Countless facts have proved that mutual aid teams, characterized by private ownership of means of production, decentralized management, and collective labor, are a relatively easy form to accept for these farmers who intend to take the road of cooperation but cannot make up their minds immediately. Organizing individual farmers to participate in mutual aid teams and helping to do a good job in mutual aid teams is also to facilitate guiding mutual aid teams to develop into cooperatives. This approach is necessary for small-scale peasant producers. Only in this way can we specifically embody the spirit of "gradual transition" and "step-by-step progress" and naturally lead them onto the road of cooperatives.

Agricultural producers' cooperatives have the responsibility to drive mutual aid teams and individual farmers forward. Whether a cooperative can drive and unite farmers outside the cooperative is one of the important criteria for examining whether the cooperative is run well. In some areas, "cooperative-team linking" is implemented through forms such as mutual aid and cooperation networks. Mutual aid teams learn from cooperatives the experience of democratic management and collective production, and cooperatives help mutual aid teams solve problems such as work recording and scoring. Some cooperatives and mutual aid teams have also carried out necessary economic links according to the needs of developing production. Last year, more than 1,500 cooperatives in southern Shanxi Province fixedly contacted more than 5,200 mutual aid teams, making the necessary preparations for the establishment of cooperatives and also promoting the development of mutual aid teams. However, this form of contact cannot completely solve the problem of specific leadership over mutual aid teams. In the vast majority of areas across the country, where the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives is still a minority or a very small number, in addition to strengthening the cooperation's contact and assistance to mutual aid teams, we should also pay constant attention to the leadership of mutual aid teams in the process of establishing and developing cooperatives. The Party's rural branches should allocate Party members to cooperatives and mutual aid teams in a planned way. It is completely wrong to concentrate all the leadership strength in the cooperatives and leave the majority of farmers aside. In a few villages that have basically been cooperativized, although the number of farmers left outside the cooperatives is only a minority, we must not abandon our leadership over them. Where mutual aid teams can be organized, we should help them organize as much as possible; for those who cannot organize mutual aid teams and have difficulties in production, the cooperative's farming teams can help them overcome difficulties by means of contracting out farming on a piece-by-piece basis, substitute farming, etc. In short, correctly handling the relationship between cooperatives and farmers outside the cooperatives is very important for the healthy development of production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

At present, various localities are combining production to rectify agricultural producers' cooperatives. At this time, the issue of rectifying, improving, and developing mutual aid teams should also be put on the agenda. For those mutual aid teams that were disrupted in the process of establishing cooperatives, we should help them adjust their leadership composition in a democratic way, appropriately allocate backbone forces, and reorganize voluntarily, and strive to stabilize them quickly. For groups with more problems, we should seize the current urgent demands of the members and help them solve problems such as equal value exchange and mutual benefit, and clearing work and settling accounts. Several counties in Weinan Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, strengthened their leadership over mutual aid teams, solved some problems in the mutual aid teams, and have restored more than 5,000 groups, and upgraded more than 2,000 temporary groups to permanent groups, and also developed more than 2,000 new groups. This experience is good. Now production activities are becoming increasingly tense, and many scattered mutual aid teams are waiting for us to help them rectify, and many farmers with production difficulties hope that we will help them organize. Our leadership work should catch up with the demands of the masses, help them quickly, orderly, and organizedly invest in spring plowing production, and effectively solve problems in mutual aid and cooperation.

### 不能忽视对互助组的领导

　　不能忽视对互助组的领导
    在当前的农业互助合作运动中，有一个情况应该引起人们的注意。这就是，农业生产合作社发展了，而许多地区的互助组却削弱了。在整顿和巩固农业生产合作社的同时，认真加强对互助组的领导，这对于当前的春耕生产和今后互助合作运动的健康发展，都是十分迫切和必要的。
    随着合作化运动的发展，部分地区的互助组织也有了一定程度的发展。但是，在相当多的地区，由于原有的互助组的骨干参加了合作社，领导力量骤然减弱，普遍呈现涣散解体状态。有些组没有贯彻等价互利政策，评工计价不合理；有些组长期不清工结账，影响了组员的劳动情绪，有的就慢慢垮台了。有些地区在大规模发展合作社以后，剩下的中农、贫农分别组成互助组，许多生产有困难的农民被排斥在互助组之外。有些地区互助组中的党员和团员参加了合作社，富农分子和反革命分子乘机而入，篡夺互助组的领导权，歪曲党的互助合作政策，造成严重的组织混乱和成分不纯的现象。不久以前，湖北省监利、黄陂等县调查互助组的情况，发现组织涣散、问题较多的组占百分之五十以上；问题较少、基本巩固的组和已经垮台散伙的组各占百分之二十多。这种情况，是有一般性的。这就是说，除少数运动发展正常的地区以外，现有的互助组绝大部分都程度不等地存在着各种问题。许多个体农民在春耕生产的紧张季节，迫切要求组织互助，但却无人去领导他们。
    互助组是农业生产合作社的重要基础。在建立合作社的过程中，有些互助组直接转为合作社，有些组员分别地陆续地参加了合作社。这种发展、变化是必然的、正常的，不可能设想有永不变动的互助组。有些农村工作人员对互助合作运动缺乏全面观点，不能正确理解互助组、合作社的相互关系，认为互助组是互助合作组织的低级形式，现在有了合作社，它就成为“过时之物”了。因此，他们就用
  “抽筋拔骨”的办法，集中几个互助组的骨干办一个合作社，于是“建起合作社，扯垮互助组，增加单干户”的现象就发生了。
    合作社是互助组前进的方向，互助组是合作社发展的基础。这种关系已被几年来的经验所证明。山西省长治专区有二十个农业生产合作社办得很不好，它的重要原因之一就是建社时候的互助基础不好，领导骨干和群众经验都缺乏充分的准备。当然，在一定条件下，个体农民也可以直接建立合作社；但是，由互助组到合作社，却是互助合作运动一般的发展规律。我国现有的合作社百分之八十到九十都是在互助组的基础上建立起来的。近年来各地创造了“全年准备，分批发展”合作社的经验。所谓“准备”，除领导机关的筹划、安排和骨干分子的训练等工作以外，最重要的就是办好互助组。只有办好了互助组，才能为合作社准备必要的领导骨干和初步的集体劳动的经验和习惯。否则，如果没有互助组的基础，仓卒发展合作社，临时现抓，跳跃前进，那是难免要走回头路的。应该说，真正重视合作社，就绝不能轻视互助组。谁要轻视互助组，就不是真正重视合作社。
    从发展生产的意义来说，也应该重视互助组。现在合作社虽然有了很大的发展，但入社的农户仅占全国农户总数的百分之十三；而组织在各种互助组里的农户却占百分之五十左右，其中有许多是生产潜力较大的中农和富裕中农。除老解放区少数已经基本上合作化了的地区以外，在全国范围内，在相当时期中，互助组仍然是农业生产的重要的组织形式。抓紧合作社，放松互助组，实际上是抓住少数（尽管它是先进的），丢掉多数。这怎么能够保证在全国范围内实现生产计划呢？今年的农业生产任务是十分艰巨的，今年的生产准备工作在相当一部分地区却不及往年。因此，开展一个以合作社为中心的带动广大互助组和个体农民的全面增产运动，乃是十分重要的任务。如果把领导精力全部集中在合作社，放弃对占半数以上农户的互助组的领导，在生产上将会造成难以补偿的损失。
    从合作化运动进展的情况来看，部分集体所有制的农业生产合作社诚然已有很大的发展，愿意加入合作社的农民是越来越多了。但是，还有很大一部分农民，特别是占有生产资料较多的中农，至今还在动摇观望，还没有大批加入合作社的趋势。对于这些农民，一方面要耐心地等待他们的觉悟，同时还必须加以积极的教育和引导。无数事实证明，以生产资料私有、分散经营、集体劳动为特点的互助组，对于这些打算走合作化道路而又不能立即下定决心的农民，乃是一种比较容易接受的形式。组织个体农民参加互助组以及帮助搞好互助组的工作，也就是为着便利于再引导互助组发展成为合作社。对于农民小生产者，这种作法是必要的。只有这样，才能具体体现“逐步过渡”、“循序渐进”的精神，把他们自然而然地引上合作社的道路。
    农业生产合作社负有带动互助组和个体农民前进的责任。一个合作社能不能带动和团结社外农民，是考查这个社办得好坏的重要标准之一。有些地区，通过互助合作网等形式实行“社组挂钩”，互助组到合作社学习民主管理和集体生产的经验，合作社帮助互助组解决记工评分等问题。有些合作社和互助组根据发展生产的需要，还进行了必要的经济联系。山西晋南地区一千五百多个合作社，去年固定联系五千二百多个互助组，为建立合作社作了必要的准备工作，同时也促进了互助组的发展。但是，这种联系的形式，并不能全部解决对互助组的具体领导的问题。在全国绝大部分地区，在入社农户还占少数或极少数的情况下，除加强合作社对互助组的联系和帮助以外，还应该在建立和发展合作社的过程中，同时经常注意对互助组的领导。党的农村支部应该把党员有计划地配置在合作社和互助组里。那种把领导力量全部集中在合作社中，而把多数农户丢开的作法是十分错误的。在少数已经基本合作化了的村庄，留在社外的农户虽然只占少数，但是决不能放弃对于他们的领导。凡可以组织互助组的，要尽可能帮助他们组织起来；对于不能组织互助组而在生产上有困难的，可由合作社的耕作队以分片包干代耕等换工形式，帮助他们克服困难。总之，正确处理合作社和社外农民的关系，对生产和互助合作运动的健康发展是十分重要的。
    目前各地正在结合生产整顿农业生产合作社。在这个时候，应该把互助组的整顿、提高和发展问题也列入议事日程。对那些在建立合作社过程中打乱了的互助组，应该帮助他们用民主方式调整领导成分，适当配备骨干力量，重新自愿组合，争取迅速稳定下来。对于存在问题较多的组，应该抓住组员当前的迫切要求，帮助它们解决等价互利、清工结账等问题。陕西渭南专区几个县加强对互助组的领导，解决了互助组中的一些问题，已经恢复了五千多个组，并且把二千多个临时组提高为常年组，还发展了二千多个新组。这个经验是好的。现在生产活动日益紧张，许多涣散了的互助组等待我们帮助整顿，许多生产有困难的农户希望我们帮助他们组织起来。我们的领导工作应该赶上群众的要求，帮助他们迅速地有秩序地有组织地投入春耕生产，并且切实解决互助合作方面的问题。
