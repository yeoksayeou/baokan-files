　　Raise Vigilance, Expose Hu Feng
　　Not a Writer, But a Conspirator
　　Jin Zhonghua
    After reading Hu Feng's so-called "self-criticism" and the materials revealed by Shu Wu regarding the Hu Feng anti-Party clique published in the "People's Daily," I was shocked, I was angered, and I further felt that we must raise our vigilance, strengthen our struggle, and thoroughly smash this long-disguised and hidden anti-Party and anti-people conspiratorial group. The entire cultural and academic circles must resolutely launch this struggle, and we in the press must actively engage in this struggle.

    In the past, we regarded Hu Feng as a writer, as one of the cultural workers. We felt that he was somewhat arrogant and conceited, and his writing was obscure and difficult to read. He wore the cloak of Marxism, thus deceiving many people for a long time. Now that the materials revealed by Shu Wu have been made public, the true face of this double-dealer and conspirator who has been hiding in the ranks of cultural workers for twenty years has been completely exposed. Seeing the Hu Feng clique's vicious hatred for the entire progressive cultural circles led by the Party, its mad opposition to the Party, the people, and the revolution, truly makes one angry! This is no longer a matter of thought, but a political issue.

    We feel infinite anger. This double-dealer and conspirator who has been hiding his head and showing his tail for twenty years has exhausted all the vicious words he could use to slander the Party and the entire progressive cultural circles. Seeing anyone who accepted the Party's influence, who participated in the revolutionary struggle, he secretly gnashed his teeth and cursed them. What does this show about him? This is a despicable and insidious enemy. In his so-called "self-criticism," Hu Feng still pretends to talk about "the revolutionary nature and standpoint of the petty bourgeoisie" – he is using this guise to win over the masses and deceive the masses. We all know that intellectuals from the petty bourgeoisie, under the leadership of the Party, can progress and be transformed by throwing themselves into the revolutionary cause. As the "People's Daily" editor pointed out, a truly intellectual with "the revolutionary nature and standpoint of the petty bourgeoisie" (and there are hundreds of thousands of such people in China) cooperates with the Chinese Communist Party and is willing to be led by the Party. But Hu Feng and his small clique are not. He has consistently carried out anti-Party and anti-people conspiratorial activities in a planned and organized manner. In the most difficult years when the Chinese Communist Party led the people's revolutionary struggle, when the Kuomintang reactionaries persecuted the Party, the people, and the progressive cultural circles most fiercely, it was also when the Hu Feng clique was most rampant in its activities. The Chinese people's revolution was victorious, and his conspiratorial activities also adapted to the new situation and developed: he wanted to open up new areas, expand the group, and establish more strongholds. All this proves that the Hu Feng anti-Party clique is a completely reactionary political conspiracy group, which is completely hostile to our people's revolutionary cause.

    These materials that have already been revealed tell us that we must raise our vigilance and strengthen our struggle. Facts prove that the Hu Feng clique's long-term conspiratorial activities have infiltrated all aspects of the cultural and academic circles and have also penetrated the press to seize positions. Therefore, we must actively participate in the struggle, completely expose all the conspiratorial activities of the Hu Feng clique, thoroughly defeat this reactionary conspiracy group, and ensure the victorious advance of our people's revolution and socialist construction.

　　提高警惕，揭露胡风
　　不是作家，是阴谋家
　　金仲华
    读了“人民日报”刊载的胡风所谓“自我批判”和舒芜揭露的关于胡风反党集团的一些材料，我感到震惊，我感到愤怒，我进而感到我们必须提高警惕，加强战斗，彻底粉碎这个长期伪装隐藏下来的反党反人民的阴谋集团。整个文化学术界都要坚决展开这个斗争，我们新闻界更要积极投入这个斗争。
    过去我们把胡风当做一个作家，当做文化工作者队伍中的一个。我们感到他有些狂妄自大，文字晦涩难读。他披着马克思主义的外衣，因而长期蒙蔽着许多人。现在舒芜所揭露的材料公开了，这个二十年来隐藏在文化工作者队伍里的两面派和阴谋家的真面目，已经完全暴露出来了。看到胡风集团对于党所领导的整个进步文化界的恶毒仇恨，它对党对人民对革命的疯狂敌对，真使人愤怒！这已经不是一个思想问题，而是一个政治问题了。
    我们感到无限的愤怒。这个二十年来藏头露尾的两面派、阴谋家，用尽他所能用的一切恶毒的字眼来污蔑党和整个进步文化界。看到谁接受了党的影响，谁参加了革命斗争，他就暗地里咬牙切齿加以咒骂。这说明他究竟是什么？这是卑劣阴险的敌人。胡风在他的所谓“自我批判”中还要假惺惺地说什么“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”——他是利用这个外衣来争取群众，欺蒙群众的。我们都知道，小资产阶级出身的知识分子，在党的领导下，投身在革命事业中，是可以进步和得到改造的。正如“人民日报”编者所指出的，一个真正有“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”的知识分子（这种人在中国成千成万），他们是和中国共产党合作并愿意受党领导的。而胡风和他的小集团决不是。他一贯有计划有组织地进行反党反人民的阴谋活动。在中国共产党领导人民革命斗争最艰苦的年代，在国民党反动派对党，对人民，对进步文化界迫害得最凶的时候，也是胡风集团活动得最猖獗的时候。中国人民革命胜利了，他的阴谋活动也适应着新的形势而发展了：他要开辟新区，扩大集团，建立更多据点。所有这一切，证明了胡风反党集团是彻底反动的政治阴谋集团，它和我们的人民革命事业是完全敌对的。
    这些已经揭发的材料，告诉我们必须提高警惕，加强战斗。事实证明，胡风集团的长期阴谋活动，曾经渗透到文化学术界的各方面，也曾经打进新闻界来夺取阵地。所以我们必须积极参加战斗，把胡风集团的一切阴谋活动完全揭发出来，把这个反动阴谋集团彻底打垮，来保障我们人民革命和社会主义建设事业的胜利前进。
