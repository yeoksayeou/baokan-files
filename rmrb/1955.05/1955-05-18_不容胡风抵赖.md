I work in the Jinzhou Railway Literary and Art Troupe. I am a young person. After reading Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique," I was extremely indignant.

Since the展开 of the criticism of Hu Feng's bourgeois idealist literary thought, although I recognized that this was a reflection of class struggle, I always felt that it was just an ideological problem, a theoretical problem, and of course, there was also a problem with the standpoint. After reading this article, I felt that my view was incorrect.

Through some of the materials revealed by Shu Wu, which are far from the entire materials of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, I already feel that behind these secret documents, the ghostly shadow of a bourgeois individualist ambitious and class alien in the Party's literary and art front is faintly visible—it is Hu Feng.

From these conclusive materials, we can clearly see how Hu Feng has been arrogantly attacking the Party's leadership over the literary and art movement and the Party's policies in the literary and art movement for more than ten years.

In order to achieve his goal of resisting and抵制 the Party's leadership, in order to "shake" the so-called "twenty years of mechanical rule," he believed that "it is necessary to spend a little more effort." Therefore, as early as ten years ago, he clamored "to strengthen strength, it is necessary to greatly strengthen strength." In a sense, isn't this very similar to today's imperialist elements clamoring to strengthen "strength position" and "strength policy" in order to oppose the peace and democracy camp? Isn't Hu Feng's consistent extremely blatant hostile,仇视, and painful attitude towards the Party most clearly expressed here? Now it seems that for so many years, until after liberation, and even today, Hu Feng continues to adopt that kind of crazy仇视 and憎恨 attitude towards the Party, the socialist literature and art cause, and the criticism of others, which is not accidental at all.

In order to oppose the Party and progressive literary and art writers, Hu Feng tried his best to use all despicable,阴险, and毒辣 means to attack,诬蔑, and咒骂 the Party and progressive literary and art writers.

Hu Feng instructed their small group to treat the Party and non-Party progressive writers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, "It is okay to shake hands with them with a smile wrapped in侮蔑, but if there is a trace of hope for them, it is insulting to oneself." This is such strong仇视!

Hu Feng also taught their small group how to attack the Party and progressive writers, "There is a whip wrapped in rubber with steel wire to beat prisoners. It hurts but does not show any scars on the surface. I think it is a good method." Look! How阴险 and毒辣 he is, he even loves the set of Fascist特务!

Hu Feng's literary thought is a typical bourgeois idealist and bourgeois individualist thought. This is beyond doubt. Hu Feng's own various behaviors also show that he is an ambitious person mixed in the revolutionary literary and art front led by the Party, and a class alien hiding in the revolutionary ranks. Over the years, he has been playing a role in分裂, destroying,瓦解, and weakening the Party's literary and art cause, which is also the "shaking" role he himself said. His crazy anti-Party activities are conclusive and cannot be抵赖. He himself declared that his struggle with the Party is a struggle of "coexisting with the陣地." What exactly is this problem? Isn't it very clear?

Due to "strategic" reasons, Hu Feng has now turned from offense to retreat, using Hu Feng's own words, "changing methods," in an attempt to deceive readers,瞒哄 public opinion, in order to缓和 the situation, wait for the opportunity, and卷土重来. We should clearly recognize that this is part of Hu Feng's entire conspiracy, and we cannot be deceived by him.

    不容胡风抵赖
    张慰
    我在锦州铁路文艺工作团工作，我是一个青年，当我看了舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”之后，使我无比愤慨。
    自从展开对胡风的资产阶级唯心主义的文艺思想批判之后，我虽认识到，这是一种阶级斗争的反映，但总还觉得不过是一个思想问题、理论问题，当然立场也有问题。看了这篇文章之后，我才觉得我的看法不对。
    通过舒芜所揭发出的一些还远不是胡风反党集团的全部材料，我已经觉得，在这些密件的背后，若隐若现地露出了一个在党的文艺战线上的资产阶级个人主义野心家和阶级异己分子的魔影——它就是胡风。
    从这些证据确凿的材料里，我们可以清楚地看到：十几年来胡风是怎样狂妄地攻击党对文艺运动的领导和党在文艺运动方面的政策。
    胡风为了要达到他对抗、抵制党的领导的目的，为了“要动摇”所谓“二十年的机械论的统治势力”，他认为“多花一点力气是必要的”，所以他才早在十年以前就叫嚣着“要加强实力，非大大地加强实力不可”。在某种意义上说，这与今天的帝国主义分子，为了反对和平民主阵营而叫嚣着要加强“实力地位”、“实力政策”不是很相像吗？胡风对党所采取的一贯的极端露骨的敌对、仇视和痛恨的态度，在这儿不是表现得最为明显吗？现在看来，他多少年来，一直到解放后，甚至今天，胡风还要继续对党、对社会主义的文学艺术事业，对别人的批评采取着那种疯狂的仇视和憎恨的态度，是完全不是偶然的了。
    胡风为了反对党、反对进步的文艺作家，他竟千方百计地不惜使用一切卑鄙、阴险、毒辣的手段来攻击、诬蔑、咒骂党和进步的文艺作家。
    胡风指示他们的小集团要对国民党统治区的党和非党的进步作家，“用微笑包着侮蔑和他们握手言欢都可以，但如果对他们发生了一丝的希望，那就是自己污辱了自己。”这是多么强烈的仇视！
    胡风还教给他们的小集团对党和进步作家怎样进行攻击，“有一种用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕，我以为是好方法。”请看！他该有多么阴险、毒辣，他竟喜爱上了法西斯特务的一套！
    胡风的文艺思想是一个典型的资产阶级唯心主义和资产阶级个人主义的思想，这一点已经无庸置疑。胡风本人的种种行为，又表明了他是一个混在党所领导的革命文艺战线中的野心家，是躲在革命队伍中的一个异己分子。多年来，他在党的文艺事业上一直是起着分裂、破坏、瓦解、削弱的作用，也就是他自己所说的“动摇”的作用。他的疯狂的反党活动是证据确凿、无法抵赖的，他自己宣称：他同党的斗争是“与阵地共存亡”的斗争。这究竟是什么问题，难道还不很明显吗？
    由于“战略”的原因，胡风现在已由进攻转变为退却，用胡风自己的话说就是“变换方法”，企图借此欺骗读者，瞒哄舆论，以便缓和局势，等待时机，卷土重来。我们应当清楚认识到这是胡风整个阴谋中的一部分，我们不能被他欺骗。
