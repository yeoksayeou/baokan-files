　　Local Industry Must Serve Agricultural Production
　　Weng Xuwen, Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Industry

　　In the past, we did not deeply understand the policy that local industrial production must be integrated with the agricultural economy and serve agricultural production. Therefore, in 1954, the output value of products serving agricultural production accounted for only 6.48% of the total output value of state-owned local industries at the provincial, county, and municipal levels in Hunan Province. We had merged some small machinery factories, concentrating equipment and technical strength, but only to accept large manufacturing tasks assigned by the central government, rather than to serve local agricultural production. The workers in the machinery factories were also more willing to produce general-purpose machinery and unwilling to produce farm tools, believing that "farm tools are simple, you can't learn technology, and technology isn't needed." Some factories, although they also produced some products to serve agricultural production, had very low quality.
    
    Another situation of Hunan's local industry is that its development in recent years has not been integrated with the agricultural economy. In particular, the one-sided implementation of the principle of "local materials, local production, and local sales" has neglected the unified balance of the whole country, which has further caused a phenomenon of blind development of Hunan's local industry, especially county and city factories and mines. Some enterprises relying on agriculture for raw materials, such as weaving and dyeing, leather making, oil, and food processing, have developed rapidly, causing a shortage of raw materials. The development among various industries also lacks comprehensive and planned arrangement. The sales of glass and machinery industries are not smooth, while ceramics and wrought iron are in short supply.
    
    Last year, according to the instructions of the central government, we seriously checked our work, criticized the shortcomings in our past work, and paid attention to orienting the production of local industry towards the countryside when arranging the tasks of local industry in the province this year. This year, the output value of Hunan's local state-owned industrial enterprises serving agricultural production accounts for about 18% of the total output value, an increase of more than two times compared with last year; in terms of capital construction, judging from the government investment this year alone, the construction funds used to serve agricultural production account for 34%; the output of new farm tools and agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, wrought iron and other products has increased significantly compared with last year. At the same time, according to the development of the agricultural economy and the principle of national balance, a unified arrangement has been made for the production tasks of state-owned enterprises throughout the province. Despite this, there are still some problems in serving agricultural production:
    
    First of all, some factory and mine workers still underestimate the task of serving agricultural production, believing that agricultural machinery manufacturing is simple, blindly optimistic, arrogant and complacent. For example, the Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory, which belongs to the Department of Industry, failed to complete the output and quality plan of one of its main products, the double-wheeled double-shared plow, in the first quarter. The reason is that workers generally did not pay attention to the complexity of agricultural machinery production, believing that "we are a factory that manufactures general-purpose machinery, and the tolerance of past products was calculated in fractions of a centimeter. The double-wheeled double-shared plow is a crude thing, no problem." At the same time, the formulation of the plan also lacked sufficient analysis and research, simply accommodating the output value plan, and not proceeding from actual possibilities. The actual situation of agricultural production in Hunan Province is complex, and various new farm tools must be trial-produced in accordance with the different terrain, geology, climate, and farmers' operating habits in various places. We must not blindly formulate production plans, nor can we have an arrogant and complacent attitude in production.
    
    Secondly, the product quality of many factories and mines is low and the variety is small. On the one hand, the needs of farmers cannot be met, and on the other hand, products are backlogged, and sales channels cannot be opened without establishing credibility. For example, the hoes produced by the Qiyang Farm Tool Factory are of low quality and the cost is 6.6 cents higher than the market price, making sales difficult. Some factories would rather make popsicles than farm tools. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with the increase in output value serving agricultural production. In the future, the more important thing is how to work hard to find ways from all aspects to produce a variety of products that are welcomed by local farmers.
    
    Third, some enterprise cadres still lack an overall view, disregarding the current actual situation and the needs and possibilities of their regions, and blindly developing production. Some products that can be produced in greater quantities are not noticed. For example, Yueyang could have built some lime kilns, but it didn't, and farmers have to spend three yuan per load to buy lime in Xiangtan. The gypsum in Lixian can be produced in greater quantities, but in the past we only purchased it and did not organize production, resulting in a large amount of imports from other provinces.
    
    Fourth, we have not yet paid attention to the economic and use effects of products. For example, what kind of soil is suitable for the performance of green vitriol, which areas need it, how much is needed, etc., we have not yet mastered sufficient information. For another example, if the cost of the new farm tools we have trial-produced cannot be reduced to the minimum, they will not be welcomed by the majority of farmers. We have not conducted in-depth research on these issues.
    
    In short, to better serve agricultural production, we must strengthen ties with farmers, understand their needs, accept their opinions, continuously improve product quality, understand the overall situation, and formulate practical and feasible plans, so as to ensure both the needs of farmers and the completion of industrial production tasks, and to correctly complete the glorious tasks assigned by the state to local industrial departments.

### 地方工业要为农业生产服务

　　地方工业要为农业生产服务
　　湖南省工业厅厅长　翁徐文
    过去，我们对地方工业生产必须和农业经济相结合、并为农业生产服务的方针体会不深刻。因此，一九五四年湖南省省、县、市地方国营工业总产值中，为农业生产服务的产品产值只占百分之六点四八。我们曾合并一些小型机械厂，集中了设备和技术力量，但也只是为了接受中央交给的大的制造任务，而不是为了服务于当地农业生产。机械厂里的职工也是愿意多生产一些通用机械，不愿生产农具，认为“农具简单，学不到技术，也用不上技术。”有些工厂，虽然也生产一些为农业生产服务的产品，但质量很低劣。
    湖南地方工业的另一种情况，就是几年来的发展没有和农业经济相结合。特别是片面地贯彻了
  “就地取材，就地生产，就地销售”的原则，忽视了全国的统一平衡，更使湖南地方工业特别是县、市厂矿产生盲目发展的现象。一些靠农业供应原料的企业，如织染、制革、油脂、食品加工等行业发展较快，引起原料不足现象；各行业间的发展也缺乏全面的有计划的安排，玻璃、机械等行业的销路不畅，而陶瓷、熟铁又供不应求。
    去年，我们根据中央的指示，认真地检查了工作，对过去工作中的缺点作了批判，在布置今年全省地方工业的任务时，就注意了使地方工业的生产面向农村。今年湖南地方国营工业企业为农业生产服务的产值占总产值约百分之十八，较去年实际增长了两倍多；在基本建设方面，单就今年政府投资计算，用在为农业生产服务方面的建设资金占百分之三十四；新式农具和农业机械、化学肥料、农药、熟铁等产品产量都较去年有了很大增长。同时，也根据农业经济发展的情况和全国平衡的方针，对全省地方国营企业的生产任务作了统一安排。尽管如此，但目前在为农业生产服务方面仍然存在着
  一些问题：
    首先是部分厂矿职工仍然轻视为农业生产服务的任务，认为农业机械制造简单，盲目乐观，骄傲自满。比如，工业厅所属的湖南农业机械厂在一季度就未能完成主要产品之一——双轮双铧犁的产量和质量计划。其原因是职工普遍没有重视农业机械生产的复杂性，认为“我们是制造通用机械的厂子，过去的产品公差以百分之几厘米计算，双轮双铧犁是粗糙东西，毫无问题。”同时，在制定计划时也缺乏充分的分析研究，单纯迁就产值计划，不从实际可能出发。湖南省农业生产的实际情况是复杂的，必须深入农村，按照各地不同的地形、地质、气候，以及农民的操作习惯等试制各种新式农具。既不能盲目制定生产计划，在生产中也不能有骄傲自满情绪。
    其次就是很多厂矿的产品质量低、品种少。一方面农民需要不能满足，一方面产品积压，没有树立信誉，销路打不开。比如祁阳农具厂生产的锄头，质量低，成本还高出市价六角六分，销售困难。有的厂子宁愿制冰棒，也不想制农具。因此，我们决不能满足于为农业生产服务的产值的增长，今后更主要的是如何努力从各方面找出办法，生产多种多样的为当地农民所欢迎的产品。
    第三，有些企业干部，仍然缺乏全局观念，不顾目前实际情况和本地区的需要和可能，盲目发展生产。有些可以多生产的产品没人注意。例如岳阳本来可以搞些石灰窑，但没有搞，农民到湘潭买石灰，要花三元一担。澧县的石膏可以多产一点，但我们以往仅是收购，没有组织生产，结果需从外省大量调进。
    第四，我们对产品的经济和使用效果还没有注意。比如青矾的性能适合什么样的土壤、哪些地区农民需要它、需用多少等，我们都还没有掌握充分的资料。又如我们试制的新式农具，如果成本不能降到最低限度，就不会为广大农民所欢迎。对这些问题，我们也没有深入研究。
    总之，想更好地为农业生产服务，必须加强同农民的联系，了解农民的需要，接受农民的意见，不断改进产品质量，摸清全面情况，制定切实可行的计划，才能既保证农民的需要，又保证工业生产任务的完成，才能正确地完成国家交给地方工业部门的光荣任务。
