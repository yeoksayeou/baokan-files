Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 16th: The World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau meeting, which opened in Moscow on May 10th, has closed. The meeting adopted resolutions on Saillant's report on the first item on the agenda, "The Role of Trade Unions in the Common Struggle of Peoples of All Countries for Peace, for Crushing the Plans for Atomic War, and for Meeting the Demands of the Working People," a resolution on Grasi's report on the second item on the agenda, "Organizing an International Conference of Women Workers, and Protecting their Trade Union Rights and Urgent Demands," and other documents.

The resolution on the first item on the agenda points out that recently, the danger threatening peace has greatly increased. At present, the most important and urgent task is to enable the working people to take united action nationally and internationally.

The World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau calls on all trade union organizations to strengthen actions to defend peace, to adopt and support any proposals against the revival of German militarism and the implementation of the Paris Agreements, against the establishment of aggressive military blocs and preparations for atomic war, for collective security and universal disarmament, for easing international tensions and for peace.

The Executive Bureau believes that the Asian-African Conference has made a great contribution to the struggle of the people of colonial countries against imperialism and for peace, and therefore suggests that trade union organizations help the working people of colonial and economically backward countries in the spirit of the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference.

The Executive Bureau believes that only the unity of the working people can achieve victory in the cause of defending social and economic demands and in the cause of defending peace. Therefore, it calls on all trade union organizations to persist in their efforts to establish and restore the unity of trade unions in all countries. The Executive Bureau also decided to take all measures to enhance the links between the working people of all countries and to promote the exchange of trade union delegations between capitalist countries and between them and socialist countries.

The meeting also decided to convene an International Conference of Women Workers in June 1956.

    世界工联执行局会议闭幕
    新华社十七日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：五月十日在莫斯科开幕的世界工会联合会执行局会议已经闭幕。会议通过了关于赛扬就第一项议程“工会在各国人民争取和平、争取粉碎原子战争计划和争取满足劳动人民要求的共同斗争中的作用”所作的报告的决议，关于葛拉西就第二项议程“组织国际劳动妇女代表会议以及保卫她们的工会权利和迫切要求”所作的报告的决议以及其他文件。
    在关于第一项议程的决议中指出，最近，威胁和平的危险大大增加了。目前最重要和最迫切的任务，莫过于使劳动人民在全国范围内和在国际上采取团结一致的行动。
    世界工联执行局号召一切工会组织加强保卫和平的行动，采纳和支持反对复活德国军国主义和实现巴黎协定、反对建立侵略性的军事集团和准备原子战争、争取集体安全和普遍裁军、争取缓和国际紧张局势和争取和平的任何建议。
    执行局认为亚非会议对各殖民地国家人民反对帝国主义和争取和平的斗争作出了巨大的贡献，因此建议各工会组织根据亚非会议决议的精神来帮助殖民地和经济落后国家的劳动人民。
    执行局认为只有劳动人民团结一致才能在维护社会和经济要求的事业中、在保卫和平的事业中取得胜利，因此号召所有的工会组织在一切国家内坚持努力建立和恢复工会的统一。执行局还决定采取一切措施，以增进各国劳动人民之间的联系，促进各资本主义国家之间以及它们同社会主义国家之间互派工会代表团。
    会议还决定在一九五六年六月召开国际劳动妇女会议。
