Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 7th. The "Soviet Army Martyrs Memorial Tower" in Lüda City has recently been fully completed. This memorial tower was built by the people of Lüda City to forever commemorate the Soviet Army soldiers and officers who gloriously sacrificed their lives for the liberation of Northeast China and the liberation of Lüda.

　　The memorial tower stands in Stalin Square in Lüda City. People can see the towering tower body from afar, set against the blue sky and green mountains. The tower is thirty meters and ninety centimeters high, and the surface structure is all black, gray, and pink granite. In front of the tower stands a majestic bronze statue of a Soviet soldier holding a submachine gun, standing guard. The base of the tower is decorated with two bronze reliefs measuring six meters forty centimeters long and one meter sixty-three centimeters wide, with the theme of "Defending Peace" and "Production and Construction." One relief depicts the joyous scene of the people of Lüda welcoming the Soviet Army's liberation of Lüda; the other depicts the people of Lüda carrying out peaceful construction under the protection of the Soviet Army. On a large black stele at the front center of the tower base, the five characters "Eternal Glory" are inscribed in both Chinese and Soviet languages. The two lines of inscription below the large characters are: "The great achievements of the Soviet Army in defending world peace and protecting human freedom will last forever!" "Eternal glory to the Soviet Army martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves to defeat Japanese imperialism!"

　　Construction of the memorial tower began in April 1953. The people of Lüda and other places contributed greatly to the construction of this building. Sculptor Lu Hongji and his seven assistants spent more than a year sculpting the heroic image of Soviet soldiers defending peace. Many students from the sculpture and painting departments of the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts also participated in the design of the bronze statue. In the process of creating the bronze statue and relief, the sculptors went to the countryside of Lüshun and the factories of Lüda City several times to experience the feelings of the people of Lüda towards the Soviet Army. They also befriended Soviet soldiers stationed in the Lüshunkou area and became familiar with their firm will to defend peace. Foundry workers and bronze casters overcame the difficulties encountered in their work with perseverance and completed the casting and installation of the bronze statue day and night within a month. Yu Tianyou, a sixty-five-year-old retired crane worker who had returned home, traveled more than one hundred li to the construction site to participate in the installation of the bronze statue.

　　Before the completion of the memorial tower, local residents had planted more than 10,000 trees and flowers around the tower. Now, the area around the tower is lush green, and hundreds of flowers are blooming in the two newly built flowerbeds next to the tower.

Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 7th. People from all walks of life in Lüda City solemnly held a completion ceremony for the Soviet Army Martyrs Memorial Tower in Stalin Square, Dalian, on the afternoon of the 7th.

　　More than 10,000 people participated in the completion ceremony, including troops of the Soviet Army stationed in the Lüshunkou area, troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Lüshunkou area, cadres from agencies in Lüda City, workers, farmers, students, and residents' representatives.

　　The flags of the Soviet Union and China were planted at the front end of the base of the Soviet Army Martyrs Memorial Tower. Near the square, on the facades of the buildings facing the Soviet Army Martyrs Memorial Tower, hung large portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Bulganin. In the center of the venue were honor guards and military bands composed of both Soviet and Chinese troops.

　　At 2:00 p.m., the completion ceremony of the Soviet Army Martyrs Memorial Tower began in a solemn and respectful atmosphere, and the military band played the Soviet and Chinese national anthems.

　　After the ribbon-cutting and unveiling of the Soviet Army Martyrs bronze statue, Song Li, Second Secretary of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee and Mayor of Lüda City, spoke at the meeting. He first expressed condolences and high respect to the immortal Soviet Army martyrs and extended his warmest condolences to the families of the martyrs on behalf of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee, the Lüda Municipal People's Committee, and the people of Lüda City. He said: The Soviet Army martyrs paid a precious price in blood to defend peace. This is something we must never forget for generations to come. In order to commemorate the martyrs, we must always maintain and improve our vigilance in defending the motherland, and strive to enhance the economic and defense strength of the country. Strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the national plan, and struggle to ensure the successful completion of our country's socialist construction cause.

　　A representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Lüshunkou area spoke at the meeting. He said: In order to help the Chinese people obtain liberation from the rule of Japanese imperialism, the Soviet Army martyrs contributed their lives on Chinese soil. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Army will never forget the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet Army for generations to come. We, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, must continue to advance along the bloodstained path of the martyrs, fight for the liberation of our territory Taiwan, defend our great motherland, smash the conspiracy of US imperialism to launch a new war, and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

　　A representative of the Soviet Army Command stationed in the Lüshunkou area spoke at the meeting. He said: There is no friendship in the world that is more solid and stronger than the friendship between people born in the common struggle against common enemies, in the struggle for the great cause of socialism, and in the common labor of building a new life. He said: The memorial tower erected for the Soviet Army martyrs is a symbol of the unbreakable and great friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples.

　　Soviet Consul General to Dalian, Belyanov, also spoke at the meeting.

　　After the speeches, members of the presidium presented wreaths to the memorial tower amidst mournful music. All attendees observed a moment of silence. The completion ceremony of the Soviet Army Martyrs Memorial Tower was announced to be over.

　　After the ceremony, troops of the Soviet Army stationed in the Lüshunkou area, troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Lüshunkou area, guests, mass teams, honor guards, and the presidium marched past the Soviet Army Martyrs Memorial Tower to pay tribute to the Soviet Army martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves to defeat Japanese imperialism.

　　旅大市各界人民举行纪念塔落成典礼
    新华社旅大七日电　旅大市“苏军烈士纪念塔”已经在最近全部落成。这个纪念塔是旅大市人民为了永远纪念为解放东北、解放旅大而光荣牺牲的苏军将士修建的。
    纪念塔矗立在旅大市斯大林广场。人们远远就可以看到高耸的塔身，映衬着蓝色的天空和绿色的山峦。塔高三十公尺九十公分，表面结构全部是黑色、灰色和粉红色的花岗石。塔前站着一个手持冲锋枪作守卫状的威武的苏军战士铜像。塔的底座上饰有“保卫和平”和“生产建设”为主题的两幅六公尺四十公分长、一公尺六十三公分阔的铜浮雕。一幅浮雕上刻画了旅大人民欢迎苏军解放旅大的欢乐情景；另一幅表现了旅大人民在苏军保卫下进行和平建设的情形。塔基前端中央的一块黑色大碑石上，用中苏两国文字刻着“永恒的光荣”五个大字。大字下面刻的两行碑文是：“苏联军队保卫世界和平、保卫人类自由的丰功伟迹，万古长存！”、“为击败日本帝国主义而英勇牺牲的苏军烈士们永垂不朽！”
    纪念塔是从一九五三年四月开始动工的。旅大人民和其他各地人民为修建这个建筑物贡献了很大的力量。雕塑家卢鸿基和他的七个助手用了一年多的时间塑造了苏军战士保卫和平的英雄形象。中央美术学院华东分院雕塑系和绘画系的许多学生也参加了雕塑铜像的设计工作。雕塑人员在创作铜像和浮雕的过程中，曾几次到旅顺的农村和旅大市工厂中去体验旅大人民感念苏军的心情。他们还结交了驻旅顺口地区的苏军战士，熟悉他们对保卫和平的坚强意志。翻砂工人和铸铜工人们曾以坚韧的毅力克服了工作中所碰到的困难，不分昼夜地在一个月内完成了翻铸和安装铜像的工作。一个已经退休回家的六十五岁的老起重工人于天有，从一百多里外赶到工地参加安装铜像的工作。
    在纪念塔落成以前，当地的居民就在塔的周围栽植了一万多株树木和花卉。现在，塔的周围已经碧绿，塔旁新建的两个花圃里，百花正在盛开。
    新华社旅大七日电旅大市各界人民七日下午在大连斯大林广场庄严地举行了苏军烈士纪念塔落成典礼。
    参加落成典礼的有驻旅顺口地区苏军部队、中国人民解放军驻旅顺口地区部队、旅大市的机关干部、工人、农民、学生和居民代表共一万多人。
    在苏军烈士纪念塔塔座前端，插着苏、中两国国旗。在广场附近，面对苏军烈士纪念塔的大厦门面上，悬挂着毛泽东主席、布尔加宁主席的巨像。会场中央排列着中苏两国部队双方组成的仪仗队和军乐队。
    下午二时，在庄严、肃穆的气氛中苏军烈士纪念塔落成典礼开始，军乐队奏起苏联国歌和中国国歌。
    在为苏军烈士铜像剪彩揭幕后，中共旅大市委员会第二书记、旅大市市长宋黎在会上讲话。他首先代表中共旅大市委员会、旅大市人民委员会和旅大市人民，向永垂不朽的苏军烈士致以悼念和崇高的敬意，向烈士的家属致以最亲切的慰问。他说：苏军烈士为了保卫和平，付出了宝贵的鲜血。这是我们世世代代都不能忘记的。为了纪念烈士，我们必须经常保持并提高保卫祖国的警惕性，努力增强国家的经济力量和国防力量。努力增加生产，厉行节约，争取全面完成和超额完成国家计划，为保证我国社会主义建设事业的胜利完成而奋斗。
    中国人民解放军驻旅顺口地区部队代表在会上讲话。他说：为了帮助中国人民从日本帝国主义的统治下获得解放，苏军烈士们在中国土地上贡献出自己的生命，中国人民和中国人民的军队对于苏军这种伟大的国际主义精神，将子孙万代永念不忘。我们中国人民解放军一定要踏着烈士们的血迹继续前进，为解放我国领土台湾，保卫我们伟大的祖国，为粉碎美帝国主义发动新战争的阴谋，保卫远东和世界和平而奋斗。
    驻旅顺口地区苏军指挥部代表在会上讲话。他说：世界上没有一种友谊能比在反对共同敌人的共同斗争中，在为社会主义伟大事业的斗争中，在建设新生活的共同劳动中产生的人民之间的友谊更巩固和更强大。他说：为苏军烈士们树立的纪念塔，就是苏、中人民之间的牢不可破的伟大友谊的象征。
    苏联驻大连总领事别良诺夫也在会上讲了话。
    讲话毕，主席团人员在哀乐声中向纪念塔敬献花圈。全体到会的人致默哀。苏军烈士纪念塔落成典礼宣布结束。
    典礼结束后，驻旅顺口地区苏军部队、中国人民解放军驻旅顺口地区的部队、来宾、群众队伍、仪仗队和主席团列队走过苏军烈士纪念塔前，向为击败日本帝国主义而英勇牺牲的苏军烈士们致敬。
