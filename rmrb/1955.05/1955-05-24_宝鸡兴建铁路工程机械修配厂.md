　　Baoji Builds Railway Engineering Machinery Repair Plant
    The Ministry of Railways started construction on May 20th in Baoji of China's first regional engineering machinery repair plant. After the completion of this plant, it will repair the large-scale engineering machinery used for the new Baocheng, Chenkun, Lanxin, Baolan, and Baolan railways, and manufacture the main parts of the engineering machinery. Its production capacity is roughly equal to the total production capacity of the repair plants affiliated with the existing new railway engineering bureaus nationwide.
    The machinery used for new railway lines is currently generally repaired by the repair plants set up by the construction units themselves; because the technical equipment is limited, the repair efficiency and quality are difficult to guarantee the needs, so that the utilization rate of the new line road construction machinery cannot be fully utilized. Therefore, according to the experience of the Soviet Union, the Ministry of Railways decided to establish this regional engineering machinery repair plant in a suitable location to undertake the major repair tasks of large machinery.

　　宝鸡兴建铁路工程机械修配厂
    铁道部五月二十日在宝鸡动工兴建我国第一座地区性的工程机械修配厂。这个厂建成后，将修配宝成、成昆、兰新、包兰、宝兰等铁路新线使用的大型工程机械，并制造工程机械的主要配件。它的生产能力约等于全国现有各新建铁路工程局所属修配厂的生产能力的总和。
    铁路新线用的机械，目前一般都是由各施工单位自设的修配厂修配的；因为技术设备有限，修配效率和质量很难保证需要，使新线筑路机械不能充分发挥利用率。因此，铁道部便根据苏联的经验，决定在适中的地点建立这一地区性的工程机械修配厂，担负大型机械的大修任务。　（新华社）
