　　We Cannot Allow Unlawful Capitalists to Sabotage Handicraft Production Cooperatives
　　Li Weihua
　　In recent years, after the general line of the Party was promoted and taught to general handicraft laborers, the majority have raised their class consciousness, recognized their bright future, and actively requested to organize handicraft production cooperatives. Due to the development of cooperative organizations, the scope of exploitation by handicraft capitalists has also been limited to a certain extent. Under this circumstance, some handicraft capitalists see the general trend and the will of the people, and are willing to accept socialist transformation and strive for their bright future. However, there are also quite a few handicraft capitalists who are unwilling to accept socialist transformation, evade transformation, and even use various methods to sabotage the cooperativization of handicrafts. Moreover, this kind of sabotage activity is becoming increasingly acute and complex with the development of cooperative organizations.
　　What kind of sabotage activities are handicraft capitalists carrying out against cooperatives? According to the materials reported from various regions, they can be roughly divided into the following types:
　　During the period when handicraft laborers are brewing to organize cooperatives, some handicraft capitalists often spread various rumors to intimidate small handicraft workers, and strike at their enthusiasm and confidence in joining the cooperative, attempting to make them doubt the cooperative, in order to achieve the purpose of destroying the cooperative. For example, when the Tinghai Iron Industry Production Cooperative in Guangdong was being established, local handicraft capitalists spread rumors saying that many iron industries in Chao'an County lost money and broke up after organizing cooperatives, and some even hanged themselves. Handicraft capitalists in Lufeng spread rumors that handicraft industries are scattered and difficult to tax, so they are calling on everyone to organize.
　　When intimidation, deception, and other tricks are ineffective, and the cooperative is finally successfully organized, some handicraft capitalists create a pessimistic atmosphere, attempting to make the members lose confidence in the future of the cooperative. Or they use high wages and high positions to win over members of the cooperative with good skills, thereby attempting to disintegrate the cooperative. Chen Huiting, a capitalist of the Nanhui Iron Factory in Jiangsu, successively lured away eight group members with better skills with a wage one yuan higher than that of the farm tool group in the urban area every day, leaving only trainees and group members with poor skills in this group. As a result, due to the poor quality of the products, customers were unwilling to come to the door.
　　Some handicraft capitalists take advantage of the early stage of the establishment of handicraft production cooperatives to deliberately lower the selling price of products or raise the price to snap up raw materials. For example, Liu Guilin, a capitalist in Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, colluded with Li Guisheng to compete with the production cooperative by lowering the selling price of products. Each Chinese and Western-style wooden bed was sold at a price more than 10% lower than that of the production cooperative, attempting to crush the cooperative. When the Wuxi Umbrella Production Cooperative was first established, due to the shortage of funds, it could not purchase materials in bulk. The capitalist Zhang Futai purchased all the raw materials such as umbrella caps and umbrella paper on the market with cash, causing the production cooperative to have difficulty in obtaining raw materials, resulting in suspension of work and waiting for materials.
　　Some handicraft capitalists deliberately exaggerate and publicize how bad the product quality of handicraft production cooperatives is, or sell inferior products in the market in the name of the cooperative to damage the reputation of the cooperative.
　　The above facts are mostly the ways in which some handicraft capitalists sabotaged the cooperative in the early stage of cooperativization. At present, the ways in which handicraft capitalists sabotage the cooperative are more insidious and vicious. They often pretend to be active supporters of the cooperative, come up with many ways to sneak into the cooperative, and attempt to sabotage the cooperative from the inside. For example, they seize leadership, organize small cliques, attack activists, and use their powers to engage in corruption, attempting to achieve their own goals of getting rich. For example, Li Guangtong, a capitalist of the privately owned Chengcheng Sewing Factory in Beijing, etc., because his factory's products were of poor quality, sales were poor, debts were high, and it was in a state of shutdown for a long time. In order to escape debts and dismissal fees, he tried every means to sneak into the production cooperative, and colluded with Wang Jinglin and other bad elements in the cooperative to carry out sabotage activities. They on the one hand openly use the cooperative's funds to repay their own debts, and secretly steal the cooperative's property; on the other hand, they use despicable means to provoke the unity between members and staff, and between members, exclude leading staff, destroy the cooperative constitution, and disrupt the production management system, causing chaos in the cooperative. Since the Beijing No. 22 Sewing Cooperative merged with the Chengcheng Sewing Factory, the first batch of work damaged 370 sets of uniforms. The qualification rate of shirts dropped from 95% to 47.5%, and the rework rate of some groups even reached more than 70%.
　　The statistics on the sabotage of cooperatives by some handicraft capitalists revealed by the Zhejiang Handicraft Training Class are enough to illustrate the seriousness of this problem. According to the statistics of 247 handicraft production cooperatives participating in the training class: a total of 155 cooperatives directly suffered one or several types of sabotage from handicraft capitalists. Among them, some were bought up at high prices for raw materials, some were lured away members, some were lured by capitalists with women to sabotage the cooperative, and some were bought and won over by capitalists to use staff or members for their own use, and some funds were misappropriated by capitalists, and so on.
　　From the specific examples and statistics of these handicraft capitalists sabotaging the cooperative mentioned above, it fully shows that in the process of socialist transformation of handicrafts in our country, the struggle is sharp, complex and cannot be ignored. Neglecting class struggle will cause losses to the socialist transformation of handicrafts.
　　However, at present, many staff members of handicraft production cooperative organizations have unclear ideological understanding. Some staff members feel that handicraft laborers are scattered, backward, and have simple tools, and lack funds. There are many difficulties in organizing them. Therefore, sometimes when they see some capitalists who are superficially active and have ulterior motives, they think that they are capable, experienced, can speak and calculate, and have ready-made factories, and have more capital and tools, so it is easier to organize them. Therefore, they not only want to absorb them into the cooperative, but also want to rely on them. These staff members do not understand that the handicraft production cooperative is an economic organization of handicraft laborers. Its main organizational targets are handicraft laborers, handicraft workers, and family handicraft workers. Handicraft capitalists who do not give up exploitation, do not rely on their own labor, and specialize in exploiting others for a living, or even have ulterior motives, are not allowed to mix into the cooperative. The merger of the Beijing No. 22 Sewing Cooperative and the privately owned Chengcheng Sewing Factory mentioned above is a serious lesson.
　　Some staff members also believe that there is no class struggle within the cooperative, and that class struggle is outside the cooperative. People with this idea lose vigilance against the various tricks (conspiracies) of handicraft capitalists who sneak into the cooperative and attempt to sabotage the cooperativization of handicrafts from the inside, and disarm themselves in front of these illegal handicraft capitalists.
　　What should be done about the sabotage activities of illegal handicraft capitalists in the future? I personally have the following two suggestions:
　　First of all, the Party and the Communist Youth League should strengthen their leadership over the cooperative. At present, the strength of the Party and the Communist Youth League in handicraft production cooperatives is relatively weak. Not only is the number of Party and League members small, but also the general political and ideological level of the staff is not high. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the socialist transformation of handicrafts, Party committees at all levels should take necessary measures to strengthen the Party and League organizations and leadership within the cooperative.
　　Secondly, we should strengthen political and policy education, and consolidate and improve the existing cooperative organizations. Before participating in cooperative organizations, general handicraft laborers have long-term and intricate connections with handicraft capitalists. After joining the cooperative, although some of these connections have been cut off or weakened, the influence of the bourgeoisie cannot be completely eradicated in the short term. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the education of socialism and the cooperative constitution for the staff and members of the cooperative, overcome the backward consciousness and capitalist ideas of the staff and members, improve their political understanding and class awareness, clarify various confused ideas, draw a clear line between classes, strengthen production management, and formulate various systems, in order to do a good job in production as the central task to rectify, consolidate and improve the existing cooperative. The key to the problem lies in purifying the leadership components, and it is necessary to make the impartial, selfless, and active staff who are working hard for the development of the cooperative become the backbone of the cooperative, and improve the core leadership strength of the cooperative. Resolutely oppose those bad elements who deceive superiors and oppress subordinates, act in a perfunctory manner, are selfish and self-interested, and even abuse the name of the cooperative and do all kinds of evil to usurp leadership. For those capitalists who have sneaked into the cooperative and have seized leadership to carry out sabotage activities, they should be resolutely removed from their leadership positions, and those with serious problems should be cleaned out.

　　不能让不法资本家破坏手工业生产合作社
　　李维华
    几年来，一般手工业劳动者经过党的总路线的宣传教育后，大多数都提高了阶级觉悟，认清了自己的光明前途而纷纷要求组织手工业生产合作社。由于合作组织的发展，手工业资本家的剥削范围也就受到了一定的限制。在这一情况下，有些手工业资本家看清了大势所趋、人心所向，愿意接受社会主义改造，争取自己光明的前途。但是，不愿接受社会主义改造，逃避改造，甚至用种种方法对手工业合作化进行破坏的手工业资本家也不在少数。而且这种破坏活动随着合作组织的发展是日趋尖锐和复杂化了。
    手工业资本家对于合作社究竟进行哪些破坏活动呢？根据各地区所报道的材料，大致可以分为如下几种：
    在手工业劳动者正酝酿组织合作社的期间，有些手工业资本家往往散布各种流言来恐吓小手工业者，打击他们组社的热情和信心，企图使他们对合作社发生疑虑，以达到破坏合作社的目的。例如广东汀海铁业生产合作社建社时，当地手工业资本家造谣说：潮安县很多铁业组织合作社后亏了本，散了伙，有的还上吊自杀了。陆丰手工业资本家造谣说：手工业散漫不好收税，所以要号召大家组织起来。
    当恐吓、欺骗等伎俩无效，合作社终于组织成功时，有些手工业资本家就制造悲观空气，企图使社员对合作社前途失掉信心。或者以高工资、高职位拉拢合作社技术好的社员，从而企图瓦解合作社。江苏南汇铁工厂资本家陈惠亭，以高过城区农具小组每日一元的工资，先后拉走八个技术较好的组员，使这个组只剩下练习生和技术差的组员，结果因产品质量不好，弄得顾客不愿上门。
    还有些手工业资本家趁手工业生产合作社建立初期，故意降低产品售价或抬高价格抢购原料。如江苏省武进县资本家刘桂林勾结李桂生以压低产品售价同生产合作社拚，每张中西式木床用较生产合作社低百分之十以上的价格出售，企图挤垮合作社。无锡市雨伞生产合作社初建立时，因资金短少不能整批购料，资本家张福泰即将市场伞帽和伞纸等原料用现款全部购进，使生产合作社原料发生困难，造成停工待料。
    还有些手工业资本家故意夸大宣传手工业生产合作社产品质量如何不好，或以低劣产品假借合作社名义在市场出售，以破坏合作社的信誉。
    上面的事实多是合作化的初期一些手工业资本家对合作社的破坏方式，目前手工业资本家破坏合作社的方式是更阴险和毒辣了。他们往往伪装成合作社的积极拥护者，想出许多办法混入合作社，企图从内部来破坏合作社。如窃夺领导权，组织小集团，打击积极分子，利用职权进行贪污，企图达到自己发财的目的。如北京市私营诚成缝纫工厂资本家李广同等，因为自己工厂产品低劣，销路不好，负债很多，长期陷于停工状态。他为了逃避债务和解雇费，就千方百计地设法钻入生产合作社，并和社内坏分子王荆林等勾结起来进行破坏活动。他们
  一面公开利用合作社资金偿还自己的债务，暗中大肆盗窃合作社的财产；一面用卑鄙的手段挑拨社员和工作人员、社员和社员之间的团结，排挤领导工作人员，破坏社章，扰乱生产管理制度，造成合作社的混乱。北京市二十二缝纫社自同诚成缝纫工厂合并后，第一批活计就烫坏制服三百七十套。衬衫合格率由百分之九十五降到百分之四十七点五，退修率有的小组竟达到百分之七十以上。
    浙江手工业训练班所揭发出的一些手工业资本家破坏合作社的统计数字，更足以说明这一问题的严重性。根据参加训练班的二百四十七个手工业生产合作社的统计：共有一百五十五个社直接遭受手工业资本家一种或数种方式的破坏。其中有被抬价抢购原料的，有被拉走社员的，有被资本家用女人引诱社员进行破坏的，还有被资本家收买拉拢社工作人员或社员为其利用的和资金被资本家套用的等等。
    从上面所引的这些手工业资本家破坏合作社的具体事例和统计数字中，充分说明了我国手工业在进行社会主义改造过程中，斗争是尖锐的、复杂的和不容忽视的。轻视阶级斗争，将使手工业社会主义改造遭受损失。
    但是，目前在手工业生产合作组织的工作人员中，还有不少人思想认识不清。有些工作人员感到手工业劳动者分散、落后、工具简陋，又缺乏资金，组织起来有很多困难，因此，有时看到一些表面积极别有企图的资本家，就认为他们有能力，有经验，能说、会算，既有现成的厂房，又有较多的资本和工具，组织起来比较容易，因而不仅想吸收他们入社，并且还想依靠他们。这些工作人员不了解，手工业生产合作社是手工业劳动者的经济组织，它的主要组织对象是手工业劳动者、手工业工人和家庭手工业者。不放弃剥削，不依靠自己的劳动，专以剥削他人为生甚至别有用心的手工业资本家，是不能容许其混入合作社的。上面所说的北京市二十二缝纫社和私营诚成缝纫工厂的合并，就是一个严重的教训。
    还有些工作人员认为在合作社的内部没有什么阶级斗争，而阶级斗争是在合作社之外的。有了这种想法的人，对混入合作社，企图从内部破坏手工业合作化的手工业资本家的种种花样（阴谋诡计）就失去了警惕，就在这些不法手工业资本家的面前解除了自己的武装。
    对不法手工业资本家破坏合作社的活动，今后应该怎么办呢？我个人有以下两点建议：
    首先，应加强党和青年团对合作社的领导。目前，在手工业生产合作社中，党和团的力量是比较薄弱的，不但党、团员人数少，而且工作人员一般的政治思想水平也不高。为了保证手工业社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，各地党委应采取必要的措施，加强合作社内的党、团组织和领导。
    其次，应加强政治和政策的教育，巩固提高现有的合作组织。一般手工业劳动者在参加合作组织之前，同手工业资本家都有着长期的千丝万缕的联系。入社后，这种联系虽然有的已被切断或者削弱了，但资产阶级的影响在短期内是不可能完全根除的。所以必须对社的工作人员和社员加强社会主义和社章的教育，克服工作人员和社员中落后意识和资本主义的思想，提高他们的政治认识和阶级觉悟，澄清各种糊涂思想，划清阶级界线，加强生产管理和制定各项制度，以搞好生产为中心整顿、巩固和提高现有合作社的关键问题，在于纯洁领导成分，必须使为合作社事业的发展而努力的、公正无私、积极负责的工作人员，成为合作社的骨干，健全合作社的领导核心力量。坚决反对欺上压下，阳奉阴违，自私自利，甚至假借合作社名义，无恶不作的坏分子篡夺领导权。对于那些混入合作社已窃取领导权进行破坏活动的资本家，应坚决将他们从领导岗位上撤换下来，问题严重的则把他们清洗出去。
