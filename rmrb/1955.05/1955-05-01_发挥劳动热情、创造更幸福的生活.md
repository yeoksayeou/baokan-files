To contribute to the motherland and for ourselves

Comrades Editors:

Every year on May Day International Labor Day, we bring our labor achievements from the past year to meet our beloved people's leader Chairman Mao, and our hearts are filled with indescribable joy.

In the past year, our production team focused on solving the problem of poor product quality. In the past, the vertical standard of the auxiliary shaft sleeve we produced often did not meet specifications, and the quality of the curved beam was also not good enough, which directly affected the normal progress of the assembly process. After a year of improvement, we have basically overcome these shortcomings, and the scrap rate of products has been reduced from about 40 percent in the past to about 1.5 percent at present. Our team leader, Comrade Zhang Fuquan, improved six kinds of tool dies in 1954, which timely solved some key problems in production and significantly improved the team's work efficiency. Our team was rated as a model lathe team in the entire factory, and Comrade Zhang Fuquan was also elected as a model industrial worker in Beijing.

In order to welcome this year's May Day International Labor Day, our team launched a competition in the entire workshop in early April. Apprentice Lu Yongming's quota for making guide wheel seats is 25 per day, and since the competition started, he has been making 70 per day. Comrade Deng Hongcai's quota for picking lead screws is 18 per day, and now he is making 30 per day. We understand that every harvester and double-wheeled double-share plow we produce is to help our farmer brothers harvest more grain, to support the construction of our socialist motherland. Of course, it is also to better improve our own lives.

Now we live in newly built dormitories, many comrades have bought bicycles and radios, and many people have a happy family. With the development of production, we will create more wealth for the country, and our living standards will improve day by day.

Happy and Harmonious Worker Families

A few days before May Day International Labor Day, comrades from the trade union and the newspaper asked me to talk about my feelings about the holiday. Since I was elected as a model industrial worker in Beijing at the end of 1954, I have had a lot to say, but because of my limited ability, I can't express it, and I am very anxious. I am a blacksmith, and I have been working as an apprentice in the factory since I was thirteen years old, and I have been standing next to the hot furnace for twenty-two years. In these twenty-odd years, I won't talk about the days when I was treated like an animal in the past. Now I will talk about the changes in my family life in the past two or three years! Although these are some issues in family life, they have a great impact on my production.

There are four people in my family: my wife is named Han Eryun, and she is very organized in taking care of housework; my eldest child is nine years old and is now studying in elementary school, and my youngest child is five years old; we can say that we are comfortable with what we eat, live, wear, and cover.

There are also uncomfortable things in a comfortable life. In March and April 1954, our factory accepted a new batch of orders to produce a large number of mining chain links. There are two types of specifications for this type of chain link: one is the middle chain section, and the other is the side chain section. Our factory has never produced this product before, and no one has any experience. The tools designed by the design department are also unusable; if the time is delayed, it will affect the completion of the production plan. At this time, I was very anxious. After get off work, when I returned home, my mind was full of thoughts, making me restless. My wife did not understand me at all, and said that I frowned and scribbled as soon as I came back. I ignored her. After painstaking research, I finally sculpted a model of a side chain section tool and dried it with fire. But it was thrown to the ground by my eldest child, Shuying. I couldn't help but blame the child a few words, and almost had a fight with my wife.

In the winter of 1954, in order to reward me for the successful trial production of the new product I researched, I was elected as a model industrial worker in Beijing. When this news reached my wife's ears, of course she was very happy too. That night, we held a small family meeting, and I introduced to her the process of my election as a model, explaining that the new product I researched saved the country 80,000 yuan. After I finished speaking, she confessed to me, saying: I have given you too little help in the past. If I could support you, your achievements would definitely be even more outstanding.

Now, every time I get off work and go home, no matter how late or early, Han Eryun will always bring out a warm meal. If I want to study any problems, she will take the children to the side so that they don't disturb me. She also proposed to guarantee that I can study quietly at home for two hours.

Now, my family is already a happy family with a cultural life. When celebrating May Day International Labor Day, I want to deeply thank the Party and the government for leading us on the path of a happy and fulfilling life.

To Be a Glorious People's Mail Carrier

Comrades Editors:

I have been participating in mail delivery work for exactly four years. In these four years, I have personally witnessed the changes in our great motherland in socialist construction: new mineral deposits are constantly being developed, and countless factories, schools, and hospitals are being built one by one. Many new highways and railway lines have appeared on the vast land. As for me, I have become a glorious Communist Party member through the training of the People's Postal Service.

The people's mail carrier - what a glorious title! When I started working with a large batch of mail, I thought: what we deliver is not only thousands of letters between the front and the rear, the city and the countryside, the factory and the farm, but also a large number of books, periodicals, and newspapers, as well as instructions and orders from the state leading organs and reports and dispatches from various places. How should I complete the final process of the entire postal work? If there is a mistake in this link, will not the entire work suffer a loss? Therefore, I always remind myself: I must deliver the mail to the recipient in a timely and accurate manner, and complete the top priority task assigned to me by the state and the people.

There will always be difficulties in work. Especially like me, a young girl, I was afraid to go out after dark before I started working. But after participating in the work, I still have to work the night shift because of work needs. I remember one night when I was walking to Yinzha Hutong, a strong wind suddenly blew up, and the power lines were making a lot of noise from the wind, and the street lights and car lights went out. I was scared and anxious, and if I was not careful, the letters would be blown away by the wind. At this time, I remembered what I said when I first started working at the post office: "Never bow to difficulties, be a glorious postal worker." I mustered up my courage and braved the strong wind to deliver the letter to the recipient. Another night, I was walking halfway when a sudden wind and rainstorm came, hitting my head so that I couldn't lift it up. I really couldn't hold on, but our delivery work cannot be interrupted because of the wind and rain. The sender is calculating the time to receive the letter, and the recipient is waiting for a letter from her relatives. There are many important things in their letters, so how can I delay them? I still overcame all difficulties and completed my task. From August 1953 to the present 21 months, I have delivered a total of more than 118,000 letters and more than 358,000 newspapers and periodicals. There has never been a mistake.

In the delivery work, I often receive the gratitude of the recipients. I deeply realize that in our country, as long as our work is beneficial to the people, as long as we work well, the people will welcome us and respect us. I am a young person. In the cause of socialist construction, I will further unleash my labor enthusiasm, do my job well, and fight to eliminate errors in postal work.

### 发挥劳动热情、创造更幸福的生活

　　发挥劳动热情、创造更幸福的生活
    为了祖国也为了自己编辑同志：
    每逢“五一”国际劳动节，我们带着一年来的劳动成绩去见敬爱的人民领袖毛主席，心里真是有说不出的高兴。
    在过去一年中，我们生产小组着重解决了产品质量不高的问题。过去，我们生产的副轴轴套的垂直标准往往不合规格，弯梁质量也不够好，直接影响了装配工序工作的正常进行。经过一年来的改进，我们基本上克服了这些缺点，产品的报废率已由过去的百分之四十，降低到目前的百分之一点五左右。我们的组长张福泉同志，在一九五四年一年中改进了六种工具胎，及时地解决了生产中的一些关键问题，使小组的工作效率显著地提高。我们小组被评为全厂模范的车工小组，张福泉同志也当选为北京市的工业劳动模范。
    为了迎接今年的“五一”国际劳动节，我们小组在四月初向全车间挑起了竞赛运动。组里的学徒工陆永明同志做导轮座每天定额为二十五个，竞赛开展以来已达到每天做七十个。邓泓才同志每天挑丝杠的定额是十八个，现在每天已达到三十个了。我们明白：我们生产的每一部收割机和双轮双铧犁，都是为了帮助农民兄弟打更多的粮食，为了支持社会主义祖国的建设。当然，也是为了更好地改善我们自己的生活。
    现在我们住上了新盖的宿舍，不少同志买了自行车、收音机，很多人都有了一个幸福的家庭。随着生产的发展，我们将替国家创造更多的财富，我们的生活水平将会一天天提高。

    幸福和睦的工人家庭
      “五一”国际劳动节前几天，工会和报社的同志要我谈谈节日的感想；自从一九五四年年底我当选为北京市工业劳动模范以后，我有一肚子的话要说，由于水平不高，说不出来，心里很着急。我是一个锻工，十三岁起就进工厂当学徒，在火热的炉子旁边已经站了二十二年了。在这二十多年中间，过去当牛当马的日子我就不去说它了，现在我就说说近两三年来我的家庭生活的变化吧！虽说这是家庭生活上的一些问题，这对我的生产却有着很大的关系。
    我的家里一共四个人，妻子叫韩二云，在料理家务上很有条理；我的大孩子已经九岁了，现在小学里读书，最小的孩子五岁；吃的住的、穿的盖的，可以说得上是舒舒畅畅。
    在舒畅的生活里也有不舒畅的事情。一九五四年三、四月间，我们厂子里接受了一批新的定货，要生产大批的矿山练条，这种练条有两类规格，一类是中练节，一类是侧练节，这种产品，我们厂里从来没有生产过，大家都没有经验。设计科设计出来的工具又不能用；如果把时间拖延下去，就要影响生产计划的完成。这时我很着急。下班以后，回到家里，满脑子的心思弄得坐立不安。我的妻子丝毫没有体谅我，并说我一回来就皱眉头，画画涂涂。我也没理睬她。经过苦心钻研，好容易塑雕了一个侧练节工具模型，并用火焙干了。却被我的大孩子淑英扔到地下了。我忍不住责怪了孩子几句，差一点和妻子打起架来。
    一九五四年冬天，上级为了奖励我研究的新产品试制成功，我当选了北京市的工业劳动模范。这个消息传到我妻子的耳朵里的时候，当然她也是十分开心的。这天晚上，我们开了个小小的家庭会议，我把我当选模范的经过向她做了介绍；说明我研究出的新产品替国家节省八万元资金。在我讲完以后，她就向我检讨说：过去我对你的帮助太少了，如果我能支持你的话，你的成绩一定会更出色的。
    现在，我每次下班回家，不管是迟是早，韩二云总会拿出一份暖热和和的饭菜来。要是我想研究什么问题，她就把孩子带到一边，不让他们打扰我。她还提出了保证我在家里能安安静静学习两个小时。
    现在，我的家庭已经是一个幸福的有文化生活的家庭了。在庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的时候，我要深深地感谢党和政府带领我们走上美满幸福的道路。　北京市劳动模范　王玉桢
    做一个光荣的人民邮递员编辑同志：
    我参加邮件投递工作已经整整四年了。在这四年当中，我亲眼看到我们伟大的祖国在社会主义建设中的变化：新的矿藏不断地开发着，无数的工厂、学校和医院也一个一个地建设起来了，辽阔的土地上出现了许多新的公路线和铁道线。而我呢，在人民邮政工作的锻炼中变成为一个光荣的共产党员。
    人民的邮递员——这是一个多么光荣的称号啊！当我带着大批邮件开始工作的时候，我就想到：我们所投递的不仅有成千上万封前方和后方、城市和乡村、工厂和农庄间来往的信件，不仅有大量的书刊和报纸，而且有国家领导机关的指示、命令和来自各地的报告和文电。我应该怎样去完成邮局全部工作过程中最后的一道工序呢？如果在这一环节上出了差错，不是使整个工作受到损失吗？因此，我时刻警惕自己：必须及时地、准确地把邮件送到收件人的手里，完成国家和人民交给我的头等重要任务。
    工作中总会碰到困难的。特别像我这样一个年轻的女孩子，在没有参加工作的时候，天一黑就不敢出门了。可是参加了工作以后，因为工作的需要，还得走晚班。记得有一天晚上，我走到银闸胡同，忽然刮起了大风，电线被风刮的直叫，路灯、车灯都灭了，我又害怕又着急，一不小心信件就会给风刮跑了。这时，我记起刚到邮局工作时自己说的一番话：“决不向困难低头，做一个光荣的邮政工作人员。”我鼓足了勇气，冒着狂风把信投送到收信人手里。又一次夜晚，我走到半路上，忽然来了狂风暴雨，打得我头也抬不起来。我实在坚持不下了，可是我们的投递工作是不能因为风雨而间断的。寄信的人在计算着收信时间，收信的人在等待着她亲人的信件。他们的信件里有着很多重要的事情，又怎能由我耽误呢？我还是克服一切困难完成我的任务。从一九五三年八月到现在的二十一个月中，我一共投递了信件十一万八千多份，报刊三十五万八千多份。没有发生过一次差错。
    在投递工作中，我经常受到收件人对我的感谢。我深深地体会到：在我们的国家里，只要我们的工作对人民是有益的，只要我们工作得很好，人民群众就会欢迎我们，尊敬我们。我是一个青年人，在社会主义建设事业中，我要进一步发挥劳动热情，做好工作，为消灭邮递工作中的差错现象而斗争。
