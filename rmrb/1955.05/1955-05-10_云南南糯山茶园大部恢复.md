　　Most of the Tea Gardens on Nannuo Mountain in Yunnan Have Been Restored
　　Nannuo Mountain, in the Gelanghe Hani Autonomous Region of Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Yunnan Province, is a famous Pu'er tea-producing area. Historically, the highest annual yield of spring tea from the entire mountain reached more than 2,000 dan (100 kg). However, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the tea gardens were damaged, and the output gradually declined, eventually producing only more than 300 dan per year. In recent years, with the support of the People's Government, tea production has gradually recovered. In 1954, the entire mountain produced more than 1,550 dan of spring tea. This year, more than 30 households in all 14 villages have restored old tea gardens that had been abandoned for more than ten years. It is estimated that the restored tea gardens this year will increase the production of spring tea by 20 to 30 dan. At present, the tea gardens on Nannuo Mountain have been restored to 85% to 90%, and it is expected that full production will be restored this winter and next spring. (Jin Lisheng)

　  云南南糯山茶园大部恢复
    云南省西双版纳格朗和哈尼族自治区的南糯山，是有名的普洱茶产地。历史上全山春茶最高年产量曾达到两千多担。但在国民党反动派统治期间，茶园遭受破坏，产量日渐低落，最后每年只能产三百多担。近几年在人民政府的扶持下，茶叶生产已逐渐恢复，一九五四年全山共产春茶一千五百五十多担。今年全山十四个寨子又有三十多户恢复了荒芜十多年的旧茶园。今年恢复的茶园，估计将增产二十至三十担春茶。目前南糯山茶园已恢复到百分之八十五至九十，预计今冬明春将可全部恢复生产。　（金丽生）
