Some Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
　　Shu Wu
　　Hu Feng's literary thought is a thoroughgoing bourgeois idealist and bourgeois individualist literary thought disguised under the guise of "Marxism." For many years, Hu Feng's activities in literary circles have been sectarian clique activities proceeding from personal ambition, opposing and resisting the Party's communist ideological leadership of the literary movement, opposing and resisting the revolutionary literary ranks led by the Chinese Communist Party, and vying for leadership for his anti-Marxist literary thought and anti-Party literary clique.
　　Before liberation, I was one of the main members of this clique. In "Hope" and other publications of the Hu Feng literary group edited by Hu Feng, I published a series of anti-Marxist papers such as "On Subjectivity," fanatically propagating bourgeois subjective idealism and bourgeois individualism. It was not until after liberation, under the education of the Party and in participating in actual struggles, that I initially recognized the serious mistakes I had committed. However, after liberation, Hu Feng not only did not recognize his mistakes, but also resisted the criticism of him from literary circles and the general readership, to the point that his erroneous literary thought developed to a more serious degree. Here, I want to provide some relevant materials to help everyone better understand the essence of Hu Feng's thought and his anti-Party sectarian activities.
　　The materials I have are a batch of letters Hu Feng wrote to me before and after liberation. Below, the more important relevant materials in the letters are divided into four categories and excerpted in chronological order, with necessary explanations added.
　　First, from this type of material, it can be seen how Hu Feng consistently opposed and resisted the Party's ideological and organizational leadership of the literary movement for ten years.
　　1. Letter of July 22, 1944 (Chongqing)
　　The best date to come here is after the 16th. Because the two mandarin squares are here, the local bigwigs welcome them like imperial envoys, and I have no choice but to accompany them with bows. Also, they say they want to talk to me in detail, but they have already talked twice, but they still want to talk in detail. It seems they want to elicit my "private thoughts," but they don't specify, so how can I guess? This time, I plan to ask them to give me the topic when we talk, and I'll answer. This is the opportunity they specifically chose. So, if you come at this time, we won't have time for casual conversation, which would be a wasted trip. After the 16th, it'll be free.
　　[Two mandarin squares] refers to Comrades He Qifang and Liu Baiyu. They had just arrived in Chongqing from Yan'an and were sent by the Party to work in the Kuomintang-controlled area at that time. [Local bigwigs] refers to the progressive writers in Chongqing at that time.
　　2. Letter of January 28, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　Entered the city on the 25th, sent a letter that day and received a reply. On the day I got off the bus, I attended the second half of a conversation meeting with several people. The arrogant philistine first opened fire on "Subjectivity," saying that the author was selling savage heads. A writer who was following suit chimed in with nonsense. Cai tried to chime in, but couldn't find the words and stopped. There were also people who defended, but they only said that the intention was good, but the argument was dangerous. Finally, I was hit with a few more dull blows, but the arrogant one had already left, leaving only the follower to suffer. But the issue is developing. They are mobilizing people, and they already know it's that political philosopher of classical social history. I met him today, and he said that someone sent him the publication to read. He read four sections and felt that it had a tendency toward the theory of equilibrium.
　　So, my estimation was completely correct (the follower also complimented the essays on the spot), and the foreshadowing in the postscript was also completely set up correctly. It seems that one intention is to suffocate you to death, and the other is to suffocate the publication to death by suffocating you. The philosophers and officials belong to the former, and the writers belong to the latter. My answer is: let them write articles!
　　Now, you must prepare essays and intensify your research on this issue to prepare for battle. ... Keep up the good work! (The dots are original. The same below. - Shu Wu)
　　Now considering whether to publish "The Doctrine of the Mean" immediately, to give them more openings. What do you think? Please tell me immediately.
　　[A conversation meeting with several people] refers to a symposium held in Chongqing at that time and presided over by Comrade Feng Naichao. At this meeting, Comrade Mao Dun and others criticized Shu Wu's paper "On Subjectivity," published in the first issue of the first collection of the "Hope" magazine edited by Hu Feng. This article promoted bourgeois subjective idealism and bourgeois individualism. [The arrogant philistine] refers to Comrade Mao Dun. [Cai] refers to Comrade Cai Yi.
　　[There were also people who defended] refers to Comrade Feng Xuefeng. [That political philosopher of classical social history] refers to Comrade Hou Wailu. [Officials] refers to some Party member comrades, and of course there would be no Kuomintang officials attending that symposium. ["The Doctrine of the Mean"] refers to Shu Wu's article "On the Doctrine of the Mean," which was later published in the second issue of the first collection of "Hope."
　　3. Letter of November 17, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　There were many paths that could have been taken. However, although we have never hoped to be approved, they always want to examine and approve, and thus there are more troubles. And the times are such times, so we must consider tactics, and only in this sense consider tactics. And secondly, we must strengthen our strength, and greatly strengthen our strength. This is somewhat painful.
　　The next day, I said a few words, meaning that I have never flown any flag. See how they understand it. Also, another Lord He attacked Si Xing for promoting adventurism. There are such ridiculous judges in the world.
　　[They always want to examine and approve] The "they" here refers to the comrades in charge of literature and art in Chongqing at that time. [The next day] refers to the day after a leading Party comrade talked with Hu Feng and Shu Wu and criticized the errors in "On Subjectivity." [Lord He] refers to Comrade He Qifang.
　　[Si Xing] is Lu Ling.
　　4. Letter of December 8, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　Of course, it's a bit boring to end up like this, but the problem is not only with the lords, but the lords are also representatives of a large group of readers. I think that in the future, before writing, I have to become the lords first, and then fight with myself who has become the lords, to prevent them from not understanding and to prevent them from constituting a crime. Of course, this is also boring, but I have to be a great warrior who can fight with boredom.
　　[Lords] refers to leading comrades in the Party's literary and art work. Hu Feng described the responsible positions in the Party's work as "small official positions," so he called the responsible comrades "officials" and "lords." The materials quoted later also refer to them as "the powerful and influential." Later, the Party is also referred to as "the official."
　　5. Letter of December 17, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　Received both letters. I think it's still better to be calm. When I said to change methods, I was just saying to add some defense in strategy. There is nothing illusory or vague. Haven't you already experienced their tactics? But you want to completely reject the manuscript of "Living Materialism," which confuses me. If you feel that you must rewrite it due to your subjective requirements, that is correct. Otherwise, as long as you stand firm, what are you afraid of?
　　Both letters mentioned Qiao and Hu. In fact, Hu left early, and Qiao hasn't met or talked with me alone since that time. I don't know what to tell them. Don't you think they are the powerful and influential? However, Mr. Qiao likes to travel incognito. I think it's better to be calm for the time being.
　　[Haven't you already experienced their tactics?] refers to the fact that a leading Party comrade talked with Hu Feng and Shu Wu and criticized the errors in "On Subjectivity," as mentioned in the letter of November 17, 1945. ["Living Materialism"] A manuscript written by Shu Wu at that time, which systematically promoted idealism and individualism, was never published. [Qiao] refers to Comrade Qiao Guanhua. [Hu] refers to Comrade Hu Qiaomu.
　　6. Letter of February 10, 1946 (Chongqing)
　　As for the official, I don't think we can compromise. They only take the average of what the people around them say, which makes it difficult to communicate. But of course, we always have to deal with them superficially.
　　[Official] refers to the Party, see the explanation after the previously quoted letter of December 8, 1945.
　　7. Letter of September 27, 1948 (Shanghai)
　　Now, it has become a situation of full-scale attack, from those young masters all the way to Yao and Duanmu's ilk. The main target is a few people. ... It seems that it will become even more rampant.
　　... The war has already started. If we do well, we can take it a step further. Otherwise, we can only leave it alone and do our own thing. ...
　　[Full-scale attack] refers to the public criticism and struggle against Hu Feng's literary thought by some Party writers, including Comrade Shao Quanlin, in Hong Kong at that time. The following letter also discusses this matter. [Those young masters] refers to several writers who wrote articles criticizing Hu Feng in Hong Kong at that time. [A few people] refers to several main members of Hu Feng and his literary clique.
　　8. Letter of October 26, 1948
　　Today's struggle can be elevated to a very high significance, and the opponent is particularly bad. ... It seems that they are launching various despicable means (including dogmatic propaganda in writing) to resist and counterattack, while trying their best to force me to "talk" and seek a favorable truce. ... But because of our unfavorable situation, we should be particularly cautious and not underestimate the enemy. ...
　　We want to shake the 20-year rule of mechanism, and it is necessary to spend a little more effort. ...
　　The current weapon is to "invite" me away immediately, which is also the last resort of the young masters. Now we are under a double attack of forcing and inviting.
　　[Today's struggle] refers to the struggle of the Hu Feng clique against the Party writers in Hong Kong who criticized their literary thought. At that time, Party comrades in Hong Kong, fearing that Hu Feng might be in danger living in the harsh environment of Shanghai, advised him to go to Hong Kong and then to the liberated areas, and at the same time, they could further discuss literary and artistic ideas in person. Hu Feng interpreted this goodwill as "forcing me to 'talk'" and "wanting to 'invite' me away immediately."
　　9. Letter of March 15, 1950 (Beijing after liberation)
　　1. Culturally, that place is a new area, where you can get rid of all personal relationships and engage in pioneering work, which is probably better than anywhere else. ...
　　3. The Shanghai literary scene is being dominated by several fierce people, and it is impossible for us to publish books or periodicals. Beijing is too crowded, and Wuhan and Hunan seem to be clueless, so we are using the remnants of Hong Kong as a guide. The Northeast does not have this pressure (or it is very thin) and is close to Tianjin. Tianjin's literary movement is very active and promising, presided over by Lu Li and others.
　　[That place] refers to the Northeast. In the early days of liberation, Hu Feng wanted to introduce Shu Wu to the Northeast to develop his work. [Remnants of Hong Kong] Hu Feng always described the ideological struggle against him by Party writers in Hong Kong as a sectarian thing. "Remnants of Hong Kong" and the so-called "Hong Kong faction" in the letter quoted below, are used in this sense.
　　10. Letter of March 29, 1950 (Beijing after liberation)
　　The literary world is really chaotic, and it's almost impossible not to play dead. The Hong Kong faction won't let go, and Xinhua (presided over by the Hong Kong faction) in Shanghai won't sell "Hanging Sword Collection." Beijing is attacking A Long, and theoretician He is attacking you and me, which is conceivable. ...
　　... After the Hong Kong faction's fuss, bookstores shake their heads when they see your name. ...
　　... The poem, after it was published, aroused a fever among readers, but the literary world wants to obliterate it and suppress it. Many places are reciting and broadcasting it. ... If anyone is willing, they can recite it and see.
　　[Beijing is attacking A Long] refers to the criticism of A Long's literary thought in the "People's Daily" and "Literary Gazette" at that time. [Theoretician He] refers to Comrade He Qifang. [Poem] refers to Hu Feng's own long poem "Time Has Begun!"
　　The above materials clearly show that Hu Feng's activities on the literary front in the past decade have mainly been consciously, consistently, and increasingly stubbornly and cunningly fighting against the Party's ideological and organizational leadership of the literary movement. He called this ideological leadership "the ruling force of mechanism" and called on the people in his clique to "spend some effort" to "shake" it from the root. In a letter he wrote in 1948, he believed that literature and art had been ruled by mechanism for 20 years. That is to say, he included the proposal of the slogan "revolutionary literature" since 1928, the League of Left-Wing Writers' advocacy of the idea of "proletarian revolutionary literature," and even the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942 in the "ruling force of mechanism" and opposed and attacked them.
　　Hu Feng's opposition to and resistance to the Party's ideological leadership of the literary movement inevitably leads to opposition and resistance to the organizational leadership through which this ideological leadership is implemented. Hu Feng maliciously and provocatively described the Party as "the official," and the comrades who worked in literature and art as "officials," "imperial envoys," "the powerful and influential," "lords," and "young masters." This fully demonstrates Hu Feng's antipathy and hatred towards the Party's leadership in literature and art. Hu Feng made it clear that he would deal with the Party (that is, the "official" he spoke of) superficially and would never "compromise" in reality.
　　It can also be seen here that Hu Feng adopted a very stubborn attitude of resistance to the criticism of the erroneous ideas in "On Subjectivity" and other articles by some comrades in the literary and artistic circles at that time. He used the most vicious words to curse those comrades.
　　Second, from this type of material, it can be seen how Hu Feng consistently opposed and resisted the revolutionary literary ranks led by the Party and composed of Party and non-Party progressive writers for ten years.
　　11. Letter of March 27, 1944 (Chongqing)
　　I'm going to the countryside the day after tomorrow, but I have to come back on the 13th or 14th of next month. In the meantime, I have to squeeze out a stereotyped essay. Life is short, and I don't know what kind of joke fate is playing. However, I can only "endure" it. To be a merchant, I have to gamble and whore with my opponents. To stand firm in this circle, I have to accompany them to the celebratory theatrical performance!
　　... For example, in the celebratory theatrical performances of the past few years, I should actually excuse myself, or even dance a dance of demons, but I have been mixing with maggots all along.
　　[Celebratory theatrical performance] refers to participating in the activities of the progressive literary and art circles at that time. The letter of June 21, 1944, calls the activities commemorating Qu Yuan during the Dragon Boat Festival "performing celebratory theatrical performances for the poets," which can be confirmed. Here, Hu Feng even viciously called the people in the progressive literary and art circles "maggots."
　　12. Letter of May 25, 1944 (Chongqing)
　　I wanted to reply to the previous letter a few days ago, but I put it down because my mood was a bit gloomy. I don't want to analyze this gloom anymore. In short, it's like being in a situation where everyone is rejoicing without reason, but I feel the opposite, so not only am I lonely and unhappy, but I am also regarded as a heretic and hated. In short, it's like being separated from the world.
　　... Fortunately, this kind of enjoyment is common, just as the saying goes, a blade of grass is nourished by a drop of dew, but it will absolutely and absolutely not come from those various philistines. I can warn them, affirm them, shake hands and make peace with them with a smile covering contempt, but if I have a trace of hope for them, then I am humiliating myself.
　　[Philistines] refers to the Party and non-Party progressive writers and cultural workers in the Kuomintang-controlled area at that time. The letter of January 28, 1945, cited in the previous section, calls Comrade Mao Dun "the arrogant philistine," and the letter of July 31, 1944, when referring to Comrade Ma Zhemin, says: "Ma is also an acquaintance, a small philistine." This can also be confirmed.
　　13. Letter of November 27, 1944 (Chongqing)
　　Don't you see how despicable those philistines who only regard themselves as treasures and others as worthless dogs or pigs are! ...
　　Wen Yiduo is of course opportunistic, but he has succeeded, so we have to flatter him. There are even uglier characters here.
　　14. Letter of April 13, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　Even the bookstore lords think that the publication is guilty of sectarianism (not widely inviting literary tycoons), and they use the excuse that they can't publish it from the fourth issue onwards. Look, what kind of world is this. But we must continue to publish it, find ways to publish it. And it must be published with more light and more power, to slap them in the face.
　　[Publication] refers to "Hope."
　　15. Letter of May 22, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　Are you concerned about the "scene"? - It's just dogs fighting. Of course, it's not a real fight.
　　Has the second issue of the publication been sent? Difficulties are hard to describe in a word. Some writers are trying to murder it.
　　[Scene] refers to the literary scene.
　　16. Letter of May 29, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　Regarding the reply, I have a few suggestions. (1) The response to the masters is too cockfighting-like. The style is not grand. There is a kind of whip wrapped in rubber and steel wire to beat prisoners, which injures them but does not show any scars on the surface. I think this is a good method. Everything mentioned can be mentioned, but it can be simpler, and the tone can be colder, that is, more contemptuous.
　　(2) If you lightly touch on a few strokes in the front and then enter the reply to the main text, and then turn back to reply at the end, maybe it will be more impressive? (3) In the confession, you should mention dogmatism, emphatically define it as subjectivism, and emphatically point out the truth of its disasters. This is not only to grab the banner in your hands, but also to make it difficult to have the weight of confession or accusation without doing so. ...
　　[Masters] refers to the people who criticized Shu Wu's "On Subjectivity" at that time. This letter discusses how to reply to them.
　　17. Letter of June 13, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　On the literary scene, there is almost no one with humanity. It's really like walking on thorns.
　　[On the literary scene] refers to the literary scene.
　　18. Letter of June 26, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　I told you about old man Du. Later, I heard others attacking subjectivity. Recently, I learned that he may be trying to justify himself, so he is also attacking it everywhere, saying that it will cause bad influences among young people. A few days ago, he came here for something and didn't mention a word about "The Doctrine of the Mean." Instead, he greatly praised my newly published thick magazine. From these, we can infer the rest. ... Treat people like you treat yourself. You can't have illusions, especially about people on the literary scene.
　　You said that we have only been fighting alone in the past. How do you say that? Is it fighting alone to speak to the readers from a subjective standpoint? As for speaking to the literary scene, if we don't fight alone, then we (1) contact people, and (2) win people over. Then, who do you think are the targets?
　　[Old man Du] refers to Comrade Du Guoxiang. [Subjectivity] ["The Doctrine of the Mean"] refers to Shu Wu's two articles, "On Subjectivity" and "On the Doctrine of the Mean," published in the first and second issues of "Hope."
　　19. Letter of October 17, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　There will be a memorial meeting the day after tomorrow, but this is usually a disaster for me. It's extremely boring to commemorate the dead with those gentlemen.
　　[Memorial meeting] refers to the ninth anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death.
　　20. Letter of October 26, 1948 (Shanghai)
　　Now, people who have been tempered and are thinking honestly are very disgusted with them, but countless speculators are protecting them (mostly secretly), and superficial or naive young people are still somewhat confused by them.
　　... My article was given to "Chinese Writers," but a small stick that Brother Long stuck in there is in power here, harboring resentment and instigating Yang Hui, Chen Baichen, and others to sabotage it and not allow it to be published. The secret battle is still going on.
　　[Them] refers to Comrade Shao Quanlin and others who wrote articles criticizing Hu Feng's literary thought in Hong Kong at that time. [My article] refers to Hu Feng's article "On the Road of Realism," which refutes the criticisms of his Hong Kong comrades. [Brother Long] refers to A Long.
　　The above materials clearly show that Hu Feng superficially stood in the revolutionary literary ranks led by the Party, but in reality, he was very hostile and contemptuous of these literary ranks. He indiscriminately cursed all Party and non-Party progressive writers as "maggots," "philistines," and so on. He even insulted Mr. Wen Yiduo and condemned his progress as "opportunism."
　　Third, from this type of material, it can be seen how Hu Feng carried out a series of sectarian clique activities in order to oppose the Party's leadership of the literary movement and to oppose the revolutionary literary ranks led by the Party for ten years.
　　21. Letter of May 25, 1944 (Chongqing)
　　Hope has been realized. ...
　　For more than two years after escaping the disaster, I have been waiting for this hope. Although I know rationally that it is a heavy burden, my mood is high. But once it is realized, I suddenly feel an unexpected heaviness. I suddenly feel that I have to meet countless things and even my own enemies. To borrow an exaggerated metaphor, it's like a soldier who has accepted a major and dangerous mission, but is not prepared, has no weapons, has no confidence, has not recognized the necessary conditions, and the enemy is very powerful. ...
　　... I can only go up to meet them, and I must have the determination to coexist with the position.
　　[Hope has been realized] refers to the fact that "Hope" magazine can be published. [Escaping the disaster] refers to the fall of Hong Kong in the Pacific War and Hu Feng's return to Chongqing from Hong Kong.
　　22. Letter of September 19, 1944 (Chongqing)
　　The essays are very interesting. ... What's even better is to give each article a pseudonym, so that I can set up a suspicious formation, so that they will see flags all over the mountain and dare not easily attack. How fast is that. Please do not mention it to outsiders before the collection.
　　[Essays] refers to some essays that Shu Wu submitted to "Hope."
　　23. Letter of January 18, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　After seeing the publication, please give your opinion. ... In my opinion, it is absolutely isolated in the literary scene. ...
　　... For many years, I have been using the tactic of cluster hand grenades, which I heard from Brother Shoumei (in Wuhan). Various opponents understand it, but some friends don't understand it. After only one or two rounds, they think they are a thousand-pound bomb. As a result, a small flower scatters, and even a gear of the super-heavy tank cannot be broken. So sometimes I think, it's better to give up this set, so as not to suffer myself and cause misunderstandings. I can completely play my own rockets alone and fire one at any toilet or pile of slag at any time. This mood has become stronger recently.
　　[Publication] refers to the first issue of the first collection of "Hope." [Shoumei] is A Long.
　　24. Letter of January 24, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　I have accumulated too much resentment, and I feel that the targets have formed a huge existence, so I want to use the tactic of cluster hand grenades. But when it comes to using this tactic, I can only be a rope without explosive power. So I am most afraid of the depression of my friends. ...
　　Walk while bleeding! You can't be discouraged! ...
　　You can't relax. We must be determined to launch a year-long offensive.
　　25. Letter of July 29, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　The main problem is the publication, which is being tightly blocked. ... I have suffered a lot for this publication, but after thinking about it, scattered fighting is too ineffective and will be submerged. I really don't know what to do. The problem is still one: if I can compromise, the publication can be published. But if I compromise, why publish it?
　　26. Letter of February 10, 1946 (Chongqing)
　　He came just after I finished writing this letter (in the morning). The supplement of the "New Sichuan Daily" has been settled - three days a week. He wants manuscripts and insists that I write them. First, that newspaper is very bad, and second, I don't know what tricks he will play, but I can't refuse, so I have to agree to write a little, but ask him to allow me to change my name. He said, no! Look, how can this be! This is my fault for meddling. Not only can't I get a small base in strategic coordination, but I have created trouble and, if I'm not careful, I will increase the materials of the attackers.
　　[He] refers to Comrade He Jianxun. At that time, Hu Feng introduced him to edit the supplement "Shudao" of the "New Sichuan Daily."
　　27. Letter of November 27, 1946 (Shanghai)
　　A newspaper wants to publish a weekly, which I have agreed to edit using someone else's name (because the newspaper's position is not good). Please continue to send short articles of a few hundred to two or three thousand words.
　　[A newspaper] refers to "Shishi Xinbao." [Weekly] refers to "Qingguang." [Someone else] refers to Jia Zhifang.
　　The above materials clearly show how painstakingly Hu Feng cultivated his clique in the past decade. The "Hope" magazine he edited was the main battlefield for his clique to fight. He repeatedly mobilized the members of his clique, encouraging them to "charge," encouraging them to "coexist with the position," and making a show of force, setting up suspicious formations, with the spearhead pointing at the Party's leadership of the literary movement and the progressive literary ranks led by the Party. He also introduced others to edit supplements in reactionary newspapers to establish "small bases for coordination" for him. Fourth, from this type of material, it can be seen what kind of ideology and worldview was the basis for all these anti-Party sectarian activities carried out by Hu Feng in literary circles for ten years.
　　28. Letter of October 26, 1943 (Chongqing) (This letter was written to Lu Ling. At that time, Lu Ling and I lived together, so this letter from Hu Feng to him and several other letters were mixed with mine and kept here. - Shu Wu)
　　... People always have to "feed themselves with others," but they must "feed" each other. ... Enthusiasm is lovely, and no one wants it to lose its natural state, but in this society, some people have to condense it into ice. The sacredness of enthusiasm that is so hot that it turns cold only illustrates the sadness of this world. ... "Insult" is also human nourishment. Endure it for a while. ... Treat "insult" as milk and complete the work.
　　29. Letter of January 4, 1944 (Chongqing)
　　Although I am not worthy of being called a beast, I am like being locked in a cage. Even if there is an occasional shout, the spectators feel that it has nothing to do with them. Alas! And some other people think that this shout is also annoying and hateful and want to cover it with airtight iron plates.
　　30. Letter of March 27, 1944 (Chongqing)
　　At this time, I think I have to "take the world as my responsibility." This is not that extravagant heroism, but to be responsible for myself, to be stronger, more, and to count even the dirtiest and most bastard things on my own account. In this sense, the sentence "All things are ready in me" may not be unspeakable.
　　31. Letter of October 9, 1944 (Chongqing)
　　I wrote a short essay to match the appearance. I originally wanted to attack objectivism in creation, but later I found that it seemed to echo you. But it is extremely dry and unsatisfactory. I suffer whenever I touch on this theoretical issue.
　　[A short essay] refers to Hu Feng's "Placing Oneself in the Struggle for Democracy," which was published in the first issue of the first collection of "Hope" at that time.
　　32. Letter of November 1, 1944 (Chongqing)
　　Yesterday, I finished reading "The Philosophy of Man" in a hurry. I feel that it is also a not-so-small battle, and it is not without "novelty." ... Regarding individualism, it seems to be said too little, and it must be combined with collectivism to say it. This is not only due to concerns, but also because it is not enough to see its true value and how to critically accept it. ... There should be a chapter on the elevation or sublimation of the spirit, from which to understand the independence of ideology, and from this to see the power of ideals and the spirit of sacrifice. And I think this is the highest peak of the whole book, giving a fatal blow to the philistine materialism.
　　["The Philosophy of Man"] is a manuscript written by Shu Wu at that time, later renamed "Living Materialism," which was not published.
　　33. Letter of May 31, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　I feel that true subjectivity is running, and a great will runs through China. This can only be said that you have turned recognition (?) into a real feeling. Before, didn't you affirm it? So, the articles "Subjectivity" and "The Doctrine of the Mean" were not filled with this real feeling, and I am afraid this is the shortcoming. Not to mention authority, but some honest people always feel a little different, and it is not because of this.
　　34. Letter of June 13, 1945 (Chongqing)
　　... Like "Subjectivity," fighting against abstract ideology is also one kind. Fighting while walking, rolling and fighting, can only be regarded as a way of life or practice.
　　The above materials clearly show that Hu Feng's anti-Party sectarian activities in literary circles are a concrete manifestation of his bourgeois individualism and bourgeois idealist thought.
　　Hu Feng regards individual power so highly, so-called "taking the world as one's responsibility" and "all things are ready in me," that he simply considers himself a savior and creator, thus despising the

　　关于胡风反党集团的一些材料
　　舒芜
    胡风文艺思想是在“马克思主义”外衣掩盖之下的彻头彻尾的资产阶级唯心论和资产阶级个人主义的文艺思想。多年来胡风在文艺界所进行的活动，是从个人野心出发的宗派主义小集团的活动，是反对和抵制党对于文艺运动的共产主义思想的领导、反对和抵制中国共产党所领导的革命文学队伍、为他的反马克思主义的文艺思想和反党文艺小集团争夺领导地位的活动。
    我在解放以前，是这个小集团的主要成员之一，在胡风主编的“希望”以及其他胡风文艺集团的刊物上，发表了“论主观”等一系列反马克思主义的论文，狂热地宣传着资产阶级主观唯心主义和资产阶级个人主义。直到解放后，在党的教育之下，在参加实际斗争当中，我才初步认识到自己所犯的严重错误。但是，胡风在解放后不仅是对于他的错误没有认识，反而对抗着文艺界和广大读者对他的批评，以至使他的错误的文艺思想发展到更加严重的程度。在这里，我要提供一些有关的材料，以帮助大家更好地认识胡风思想和他的反党宗派活动的实质。
    我所掌握的材料，就是胡风在解放前后写给我的一批信。下面就将信中较重要的有关材料分成四类，依写信时间先后摘录出来，附加必要的说明。
    第一、从这一类的材料当中，可以看出十年来胡风怎样一贯反对和抵制党对文艺运动的思想领导和组织领导。
    一、一九四四年七月二十二日信（重庆）
    来此日期，顶好过了十六日。因两位马褂在此，豪绅们如迎钦差，我也只好奉陪鞠躬。还有，他们说是要和我细谈，其实已谈过了两次，但还是要细谈。好像要谈出我底“私房话”，但又不指明，我又怎样猜得着。这一回，我预备谈时请他们出题，我做答案。这是他们特选的机会。所以，你如这时来，我们就得不到偶语的时间，等于空跑。过了十六日，就空了。
    〔两位马褂〕指何其芳、刘白羽两同志。他们当时刚由延安到重庆，是党派遣到当时国民党统治区工作的。〔豪绅们〕指当时重庆的进步作家们。
    二、一九四五年一月二十八日信（重庆）
    二十五日进城，当天发一信后复接一信。当天下车后即参加一个几个人的谈话会后半会。抬头的市侩首先向“主观”开炮，说作者是卖野人头，抬脚的作家接上，胡说几句，蔡某想接上，但语不成声而止。也有辩解的人，但也不过用心是好的，但论点甚危险之类。最后我还了几闷棍，但抬头的已走，只由抬脚的独受而已。但问题正在开展，他们在动员人，已晓得是古典社会史的那个政客哲学家。今天遇见，说是有人送刊物请他看，他看了四节，觉得有均衡论的倾向云。
    那么，我底估计完全对了（抬脚的也当场恭维了杂文），后记里的伏线也完全下对了。看情形，一是想闷死你，一是想借闷死你而闷死刊物。哲学家们和官们属于前者，文学家们属于后者。我底回答是：要他们写出文章来！
    你现在，一要预备杂文，一要加紧对这问题作更进一步的研究，准备迎战。……要再接再厉！（旁点是原有的。下同。——舒芜）
    现在考虑中庸是否即发表，多给他们找缺口。你意见？望即告。
    〔一个几个人的谈话会〕指当时在重庆由冯乃超同志主持的一次座谈会。在这个会上，茅盾同志等对胡风主编的“希望”杂志第一集第一期上发表的舒芜的论文“论主观”提出了批评。这篇文章是宣传资产阶级主观唯心论和资产阶级个人主义的。〔抬头的市侩〕指茅盾同志。〔蔡某〕指蔡仪同志。
    〔也有辩解的人〕指冯雪峰同志。〔古典社会史的那个政客哲学家〕指侯外庐同志。〔官们〕是指一些党员同志，出席那次座谈会的当然不会有国民党官员。〔中庸〕指舒芜的文章“论中庸”，该文后来登在“希望”第一集第二期上面。
    三、一九四五年十一月十七日信（重庆）
    本来可走的路是很多的。不过，我们虽从来没有希望得到批准之心，但无奈他们总要来审定，因而从此多事了。而时代又是这样的时代，所以要考虑作法，而且也只有在这一意义上考虑作法。而其次，要加强实力，非大大地加强实力不可。这一点就有些感到痛苦了。
    那第二天，我说了几句话，用意是，我从来没有打过什么旗号。看他们怎样了解罢。还有，另一位何爷，攻击嗣兴是宣传盲动主义的云。天下就有这样可笑的法官。
    〔他们总要来审定〕这里的“他们”指当时重庆党在文艺方面的负责同志。〔那第二天〕指一位党的负责同志和胡风、舒芜谈话，批评“论主观”的错误之后的第二天。〔何爷〕指何其芳同志。
    〔嗣兴〕即路翎。
    四、一九四五年十二月八日信　（重庆）
    弄到这样，当然有些无聊，但问题不仅在老爷们，而在于老爷们也是一大群读者底代表。我想，以后得在下笔前先变成老爷们，再来和变成了老爷们的自己作战，一面妨（防）止他们不懂，一面妨（防）止他们构成罪案。这当然也无聊，但也只好做做能和无聊作战的大勇者。
    〔老爷们〕指党的文艺工作中的负责同志。胡风把党的工作中的负责岗位说成是“小官地位”，所以把负责同志称为“官们”“老爷们”。后面所引的材料中还有称为“权贵”的。后面还把党称为“官方”。
    五、一九四五年十二月十七日信（重庆）
    两信都收到。我想，还是要沉着一点的好。我说变换方法，只是说的要在战略上加些防卫而已。没有什么飘渺迷茫的。他们底战法不是已经领教过了么？而你却想根本不要生活唯物论的稿子，这却使我糊涂了。如果在你主观的要求上觉得非改写不可，那是应该的，否则，只要站得坚实，又怕什么呢？
    两次信都提到乔胡二位。其实，胡早走了，乔则那次后没有单独见面谈过话。我不知道要告诉他们什么。你还不觉得他们是权贵么？不过，乔君好作微服出行而已。我觉得暂时沉着一点的好。
    〔他们底战法不是已经领教过了么〕指一九四五年十一月十七日信中所涉及的党的一位负责同志和胡风、舒芜谈话，批评“论主观”的错误那件事。〔生活唯物论〕舒芜当时所写的一部稿子，更系统地宣传唯心论和个人主义的，后来没有出版。〔乔〕指乔冠华同志。〔胡〕指胡乔木同志。
    六、一九四六年二月十日信　（重庆）
    对于官方，我想，也妥协不来。他们只就左右人士底说话中取平均数，这就难得说通了。但当然，敷衍总是要敷衍的。
    〔官方〕指党，参看前引一九四五年十二月八日信后的说明。
    七、一九四八年九月二十七日信　（上海）
    现在，已经成了全面攻来之势，由那些公子们一直联到姚、端木之流。主要对象就是几个人。……看情形，还要愈加猖獗下去。
    ……战争已经发动了，做得好，可以推进一步，否则只好丢开不管，做自己的事情。……
    〔全面攻来〕指当时在香港的一部分党的作家邵荃麟同志等对胡风文艺思想进行了公开的批判和斗争。下面的一封信也是谈这件事的。〔那些公子们〕指当时在香港写文章批判胡风的几位作家。〔几个人〕指胡风及其文艺小集团中几个主要成员。
    八、一九四八年十月二十六日信
    今天这一斗争，意义能够提得很高，对手又特别恶劣，……看情形，他们一面在发动各种卑鄙的手段（包括文字上的武断宣传）来抵抗、反攻，一方面尽力想逼我去“谈谈”，谋得一个有利的休战。……但由于我们处境的不利，就应该特别谨慎，不能轻敌的。……
    我们是要动摇二十年的机械论的统治势力，多花一点力气是必要的。……
    现在的武器是想把我马上“请”走，也是公子们底最后一着。现在是在逼与请的双攻之中了。
    〔今天这一斗争〕指胡风小集团反对在香港的党的作家批评他们的文艺思想的斗争。当时在香港的党员同志为了担心胡风住在环境恶劣的上海有危险，劝他到香港转解放区，同时可以进一步面谈文艺思想问题，胡风则把这种好意解释为“逼我去‘谈谈’”、“想把我马上‘请’走”。
    九、一九五○年三月十五日信　（解放后的北京）
    一、那里，在文化上是新区，可以摆脱一切人事关系，从事开辟工作，恐怕比任何地方都好。…………
    三、上海文坛被几个猛人驰骋着，我们出书出刊物都不可能，北京太挤，武汉、湖南似乎茫无头绪，是以香港余风为指针的。东北没有这个压力（或者很薄），且与天津接近。天津文运很活泼，鲁藜等主持，很有前途。
    〔那里〕指东北。解放初期胡风要介绍舒芜到东北去开辟工作。〔香港余风〕胡风始终把在香港的党员作家对他进行的思想斗争，形容成为宗派性的东西，“香港余风”及下面所引信中所谓“港派”，即此意。
    一○、一九五○年三月二十九日信　（解放后的北京）
    大文坛，实在乱得很，几乎非装死不可。港派还不放手，上海新华（港派主持）不卖“挂剑集”，北京在讨伐阿垄，何理论家在打你和我，可想而知。……
    ……经港派一闹，书店看见你的名字就摇头的。
    ……诗，发表了后，在读者里面引起了热潮，但文坛却想抹煞它，压下它。许多地方朗诵，广播。……有人愿意，可以朗诵看看。
    〔北京在讨伐阿垄〕指当时“人民日报”、“文艺报”对阿垄文艺思想的批评。〔何理论家〕指何其芳同志。〔诗〕指胡风自己的长诗“时间开始了！”。
    以上材料清楚地表明，近十年来，胡风在文艺战线上的活动，主要就是有意识地、一贯地、日益顽强和狡猾地向着党对文艺运动的思想领导和组织领导进行斗争。他把这种思想领导称为“机械论的统治势力”，号召他的小集团中的人要“费点力气”把它从根“动摇”。他在一九四八年写的信中，认为文艺方面二十年来都是机械论的统治，这就是说，他把一九二八年以来“革命文学”口号的提出，左翼作家联盟关于“无产阶级革命文学”的思想的宣传，以至一九四二年毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的发表，都包括在“二十年的机械论的统治势力”里面去，对它们加以反对和进攻。
    胡风反对和抵制党对文艺运动的思想领导，必然也就要反对和抵制借以贯彻这个思想领导的组织领导。胡风恶意地、挑拨性地把党说成“官方”，把党在文艺方面的工作同志说成“官们”、“钦差”、“权贵”、“老爷们”、“公子们”，这里充分表现了胡风对于党在文艺方面的领导是如何反感与仇视。胡风明白说出，他对于党（即他所说的“官方”）是表面敷衍，实际上决不“妥协”的。
    这里也可看到，胡风对于当时文艺界的一些同志批评“论主观”等文的错误思想，是采取十分顽强的抗拒态度的。他用了最恶毒的字眼来咒骂那些同志们。
    第二、从这一类的材料当中，可以看出十年来胡风怎样一贯反对和抵制党所领导的由党和非党进步作家所组成的革命文学队伍。
    一一、一九四四年三月二十七日信（重庆）
    我后天下乡，但来月十三、四又得来。这中间，得挤出一篇八股文。人生短促，这不晓得是命运开的什么玩笑。然而，只得“忍受”。要做商人，只得和对手一道嫖赌，要在这圈子里站着不倒下，也就不得不奉陪一道跳加官！
    ……即如这几年的跳加官罢，实际上应该失陪，或者简直跳它一个魔鬼之舞的，但却一直混在蛆虫里面。
    〔跳加官〕指参加当时进步文艺界的活动、一九四四年六月二十一日信把参加农历端午节纪念屈原的活动称作“为诗人们跳加官”，可证。这里，胡风竟恶毒地把进步文艺界的人们称为“蛆虫”。
    一二、一九四四年五月二十五日信（重庆）
    前一信早几天想回的，但因为心绪有些阴暗，搁下了。这阴暗，我也不想去分析它了，总之，好像置身在大家无端得意忘形地欢乐，但自己感受的正是相反，因而不但落莫不欢，反被当作异端仇视的那一种处境下的心绪。总之，好像和世界离开了。
    ……所幸的，这种享受也常有，正如俗话所说的，一根草有一粒露水养，只不过这绝对又绝对地不会从那些各种各样的市侩们得来。警戒他们，肯定他们，用微笑包着侮蔑和他们握手言欢都可以，但如果对他们发生了一丝的希望，那就是自己污辱了自己。
    〔市侩们〕指当时国民党统治区内党和非党的进步作家和文化工作者们。上节所引一九四五年一月二十八日信称茅盾同志为“抬头的市侩”，又一九四四年七月三十一日信中说到马哲民同志时说：“马也是熟人，一个小市侩。”均可证。
    一三、一九四四年十一月二十七日信（重庆）
    君不见那些只把自己当作宝贝，视别人为蒭狗或猪仔的市侩们，是怎样的卑贱！……
    闻一多当然是投机，但他投中了，只好奉承他。这里还有比他更丑的角色。
    一四、一九四五年四月十三日信（重庆）
    连书店老爷都以为刊物犯了宗派主义（没有广约文坛大亨），托词说四期起不能出了。你看，这是什么世界。但一定要出下去，设法出下去。而且要出得更有光，更有力，用这来打他们底耳光子。
    〔刊物〕指“希望”。
    一五、一九四五年五月二十二日信（重庆）
    关心“坛”上么？——狗打架而已。当然，并不真打。
    刊，二期已寄，收到否？困难，一言难尽。一些文人在设法谋杀它。
    〔坛〕指文坛。
    一六、一九四五年五月二十九日信（重庆）
    关于答文，有几点意见。（一）对于大师们的回敬，太斗鸡式的了。气派不大。有一种用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕，我以为是好方法。所提及的都可以提及，但可以简单一点，口气冷一点，也就是更轻蔑一点。
  （二）如果前面轻带几笔就进到回答正文，临了再回转头来回敬一下，也许更神气一点？（三）招供之处，似应提及教条主义，强调地规定它为主观主义，着重地指出它底灾祸的实情，这不但是为了把大旗抓到手里，而且不如此就难得招供或控诉底重量。……
    〔大师们〕指当时批评了舒芜的“论主观”的人们，这封信中所谈的，就是如何回答他们的方法。
    一七、一九四五年六月十三日信（重庆）
    坛上，几乎无一有人气者，真是如履荆棘。
    〔坛上〕指文坛上。
    一八、一九四五年六月二十六日信（重庆）
    我告诉了你杜老头子的事，后来听到别人攻击主观，最近知道他也许为了表白自己罢，也到处攻击，说是在青年中间会引起不好的影响云。前几天因事来此，对中庸一字不提，倒是向我大赞美其新出的厚杂志。由这些可以类推其余。……对人犹如对己，不能存幻想的，更何况是坛上的人。
    你说我们过去只是孤独地作战云。这话怎么说？对读者说，在主观立场上说，是孤独作战么？至于对坛上说，如果不孤独作战，就（一）联络人，（二）争取人。那么，你以为有哪一些对象呢？
    〔杜老头子〕指杜国庠同志。〔主观〕〔中庸〕指发表在“希望”第一、二期的舒芜的两篇文章“论主观”和“论中庸”。
    一九、一九四五年十月十七日信（重庆）
    后天有纪念会，但这照例对我是灾难，与那些诸公合伙纪念死人，无聊之至。
    〔纪念会〕指鲁迅先生逝世九周年纪念会。
    二○、一九四八年十月二十六日信（上海）
    现在，有过锻炼而又诚实思考的人们对他们很反感，但无数投机家们坦（袒）护他们（大半暗地地），浮华的或天真的青年们还对他们多少有迷惑。
    ……我那篇，给“中国作家”，但被龙兄刺过的一小棍子在此当权，怀恨在心，发动杨晦、陈白尘等破坏，不让刊出。还在暗斗中。
    〔他们〕指当时在香港写文章批评胡风文艺思想的邵荃麟同志等。〔我那篇〕指胡风的“论现实主义的路”一文，这篇文章是反驳香港的同志对于他的批评的。〔龙兄〕指阿垄。
    以上材料清楚地表明，胡风表面上虚伪地站在党所领导的革命文学队伍中，实际上，对这个文学队伍却十分仇视和鄙视。他把所有党和非党进步作家，一律骂作“蛆虫”、“市侩”等等，甚至对闻一多先生加以侮蔑，把他的进步也骂为“投机”。
    第三、从这一类的材料当中，可以看出十年来胡风为了反对党对文艺运动的领导，为了反对党所领导的革命文学队伍，怎样进行了一系列的宗派主义小集团活动。
    二一、一九四四年五月二十五日信（重庆）
    希望实现了。……
    脱难后的两年多，我一直在等着这个希望，虽然理智上晓得是一个吃力的重负，但心情却是旺的。但一旦实现了，忽然感到意料外的沉重。忽然感到非和无穷多的东西甚至我自己仇人相见不可了。借用一个夸大点的比方，好像一个军人，接受了重大的危险的任务，但却没有准备，没有武器，没有自信，对于必要的条件没有认清，而敌人却是非常强大的。……
    ……也只有迎上去，而且非抱着与阵地共存亡的决心不可。
    〔希望实现了〕指“希望”杂志能够出版了。〔脱难〕指太平洋战争中香港沦陷，胡风从香港回重庆来。
    二二、一九四四年九月十九日信（重庆）
    杂文，甚有趣。……更好的是每篇一名，使我布得成疑阵，使他们看来遍山旗帜，不敢轻易来犯，快何如之。成集之前，望勿与外人道及。
    〔杂文〕指舒芜投寄“希望”的一些杂文。
    二三、一九四五年一月十八日信（重庆）
    刊，看到后，望给意见。……据我看，在坛上，它是绝对孤立的。……
    ……多年来，我用的是集束手榴弹的战术，这是从守梅兄听来的（在武汉时）。各种对手是懂得的，但有些朋友却不懂，不上一两个回合，就自以为是千磅重弹，结果是小花一散，对超重坦克，连一个齿轮也炸不断。所以有时想，不如放弃这一套，免得自己吃苦，招人误会，完全独个儿玩自己的火箭，向无论什么毛厕或渣滓堆随时放一支去罢。近日来，这心情又强烈起来了。
    〔刊〕指“希望”第一集第一期。〔守梅〕即阿垄。
    二四、一九四五年一月二十四日信（重庆）
    我积了太多的愤恨，而又觉得对象们组成了庞然的存在，所以想用集束手榴弹的战法。但一到使用这战法的时候，自己就只有做一条没有爆炸力的绳子而已。所以顶怕朋友们底消沉。……
    一面流血一面走罢，泄气不得！
    ……松不得劲，我们要决心打一年冲锋。
    二五、一九四五年七月二十九日信（重庆）
    主要问题是刊，给密密地封锁住了。……为这刊，受气受苦不小，但想来想去，打散兵战也效力太小，被淹没。真不知如何是好。问题还是一个：要能妥协，刊就可出。但如果妥协，又何必出它呢！
    二六、一九四六年二月十日信（重庆）
    这信刚写完（早上），他就来了。新蜀报副刊已说妥，——每周三天。要稿子，而且要我非写不可。一来那个报坏得很，二来不知道他会弄出什么花头来，但无法谢绝，只好答应写一点，但请他允许换一个名字。他说，不行！你看，这如何得了！这又怪我多事，不但不能在战略上得一配合的小据点，反而弄出了麻烦，弄得不好就要增加攻击者们底材料。
   〔他〕指何剑薰同志。当时胡风介绍他编“新蜀报”的副刊“蜀道”。
    二七、一九四六年十一月二十七日信（上海）
    有一个报要出一个周刊，我答应了，用别人的名去编（报纸立场不好之故），几百字到二三千字的短文望能继续寄些来。
    〔有一个报〕指“时事新报”。〔周刊〕指“青光”。〔别人〕指贾植芳。
    以上材料清楚地表明，胡风在近十年来如何苦心孤诣地培植他的小集团。他主编的“希望”杂志，是他的小集团作战的主要阵地。他一再向他的小集团的成员进行鼓动，鼓动他们“冲锋”，鼓动他们“与阵地共存亡”，并且虚张声势，故布疑阵，矛头则是指向党对文艺运动的领导，指向党所领导的进步文学队伍。他还介绍别人在反动报纸上编副刊，为他建立“配合的小据点”。第四、从这一类的材料当中，可以看出胡风十年来在文艺界所进行的这一切反党的宗派活动，究竟是以怎样一种思想、怎样一种世界观作基础。
    二八、一九四三年十月二十六日信（重庆）（这封信是写给路翎的。当时路翎和我住在一起，所以胡风给他的这封信和另外几封信混在我这里留存下来。——舒芜）
    ……人是总得“拿别人养活自己的”，不过，须得互“养”而已。……热情是可爱的，谁也不愿它失去天然的状态，但在这社会里，有的人不得不把它凝成冰，热得发冷的热情之所以神圣，那不外说明了这人世的悲哀。……“侮辱”也是人底养料，忍受一时罢。……把“侮辱”也当作乳汁，把作品完成罢。
    二九、一九四四年一月四日信（重庆）
    我虽不配称为猛兽，但却宛如被琐（锁）在栏中，即偶有喊声，看客们也觉得与己无关，哀哉！而另一些人们，却觉得这喊声也可厌可恶，还想镶上不通风的铁板。
    三○、一九四四年三月二十七日信（重庆）
    处此时会，我想，恐怕非得“以天下为己任”不可。这不是那阔气的英雄主义，而是要自己负责，更强一些，更多一些，连那些最脏最混蛋的东西都算在自己的账上。在这意义上说，“万物皆备于我”这句话也许并不是不可以说的。
    三一、一九四四年十月九日信（重庆）
    我写了一则短论，为了配样子。本想打击创作上的客观主义，后来发现了好像和你呼应似的。但枯涩之至，很不满意。一涉及这理论问题，我就吃苦。
    〔一则短论〕指胡风的“置身在为民主的斗争里面”，当时发表在“希望”第一集第一期上面。
    三二、一九四四年十一月一日信（重庆）
    昨天匆匆续读完了“人的哲学”，觉得也算一个不小的仗，并非毫无“新意”的。……关于个人主义，似说得太少，而且，这一定要和集团主义结合起来说，这不仅由于顾虑，而且，非如此不足以见它底真价值和如何批判地接受了。……应有一章论精神底高扬或升华，从这里理解意识形态底独立性，由此以见理想底力量和牺牲精神。而且我觉得这么是全书底最高峰，给市侩底唯物主义一个致命的打击。
    〔“人的哲学”〕是当时舒芜写的一部稿子，后改名为“生活唯物论”，未出版。
     三三、一九四五年五月三十一日信　（重庆）
    感到了真的主观在运行，一个大的意志贯穿了中国，这只能说你把认识（？）化成了实感。以前，何尝不是肯定了它的？所以，主观、中庸二文没有被这实感所充溢，恐怕这才是缺点。权威之类不必说了，而有的老实人也总觉得有点异样者，未非不是由于这一点。
    三四、一九四五年六月十三日信（重庆）
    ……像“主观”，对抽象的意识形态作战也就是一种。且战且走，且打滚且作战，也只好算是一种生活方式或实践罢。
    以上材料清楚地表明，胡风在文艺界所进行的反党的宗派活动，正是他的资产阶级个人主义和资产阶级唯心主义思想的具体表现。
     胡风把个人力量看得那样大，所谓“以天下为己任”和“万物皆备于我”，简直以救世主和造物主自命，因而轻蔑世界，轻蔑人民，轻蔑伟大的工人阶级政党，轻蔑党所领导的文学队伍的集体力量，妄想要党和党所领导的文学队伍服从他个人和他的小集团的意志，按照他个人和他的小集团的面貌来改造它们。他在文艺界所进行的宗派活动，就是为了实现他这种狂妄的个人野心。
    在这些信里，胡风的唯心主义的思想，是比在他的公开的文章中表现得更加露骨的。他认为意识形态是独立存在的，还感到什么“主观在运行”，什么“大的意志贯穿了中国”，他在“唯物主义”上面加上“市侩”两字，以表示他对唯物主义的轻蔑和反感。在这里，也表明了胡风对于我当时所发表的许多宣传唯心主义、个人主义思想的错误文章是全力支持的，决不是像他后来所抵赖，说他是不赞成那些文章的。
    极端疯狂的资产阶级个人主义和极端顽固的资产阶级唯心论，——这就是胡风反党小集团的思想基础。
    ×　×　×
    整理胡风给我的信中这许多材料之后，不禁触目惊心。这些材料，现在摆在面前，反党反马克思主义的气息，卑鄙的个人野心的气味，是这样地强烈。可是当时，却把这些信当作经常指导自己整个生活、工作和思想的宝贵文献，从来没有看出什么不对的地方。这就是一个镜子，可以照见自己当时思想的面貌是何等的丑恶！
    我在这里提供这些材料，主要为了帮助大家进一步认识胡风文艺思想错误的实质，同时也为了促使自己更进一步检查过去的错误。
