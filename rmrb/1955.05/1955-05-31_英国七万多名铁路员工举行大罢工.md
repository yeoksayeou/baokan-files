Xinhua News Agency, London, May 29th: Just as the 19,000 dockworkers in six ports including London continue to persist in their strike, seriously affecting the activities of these ports, at zero hour on the 29th, Britain experienced its first nationwide railway workers' strike since the General Strike of 1926. The strike caused four-fifths of all train services across Britain to be suspended.

Participating in the strike were approximately 70,000 members of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, who are demanding higher wages.

Before the outbreak of the strike, the Conservative government's Minister of Labour and National Service, Monckton, hastily returned to London from his constituency to consult with Prime Minister Eden on the matter, and then, with the help of right-wing leaders of the Trades Union Congress, repeatedly held negotiations with representatives of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. Eden also held emergency meetings with several of his key cabinet members and met with the leaders of the union. However, the Conservative government ultimately failed to prevent the strike.

Xinhua News Agency, London, May 30th: The British railway workers' strike, which began at zero hour on the 29th, has brought 90 percent of British railway transportation to a standstill. According to reports, many drivers who are not members of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, which initiated the strike, have also stopped working.

On the afternoon of the 29th, British Prime Minister Eden delivered a special broadcast speech on the issue. In his speech, Eden expressed his opposition to satisfying the striking workers' demand for wage increases, saying that "the government will not hesitate to seek special powers" to deal with the situation created by the strike. That evening, leaders of the striking workers expressed their determination to carry the struggle through to the end.

　　英国七万多名铁路员工举行大罢工
    新华社二十九日讯　伦敦消息：正当伦敦等六个港口的一万九千码头工人继续坚持罢工而使这些港口的活动受到严重影响的时候，二十九日零时，英国又爆发了一九二六年大罢工以来的第一次全国铁路员工大罢工。罢工使得全英国五分之四的火车班次停驶。
    参加这次罢工的是英国机车司机司炉联合会的约七万会员。他们要求增加工资。
    罢工爆发前，保守党政府的劳工大臣蒙克顿曾从他的选区匆匆赶回伦敦就此事同首相艾登会商，然后又在英国职工大会右翼领袖的帮助下，一再同机车司机司炉联合会的代表举行谈判。艾登也同他的几个主要阁员举行了紧急会议，并且会见了这个工会的领袖。但是保守党政府终于没有能够阻止住这次罢工。
    新华社三十日讯　伦敦消息：从二十九日零时开始的英国铁路员工大罢工，已经使得百分之九十的英国铁路运输陷于停顿。据消息报道，罢工开始后，许多不属于发起这次罢工的英国机车司机司炉联合会的司机工人，也都停止了工作。
    二十九日午后，英国首相艾登特别为这一问题发表了一篇广播演说。艾登在演说中表示反对满足罢工工人提出的关于增加工资的要求，他说，“政府将毫不迟疑地寻求特别权力”以对付这次罢工所造成的局势。当天晚上，罢工工人领袖表示决心要把这一斗争进行到底。
