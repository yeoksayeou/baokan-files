　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 20th. The Shanghai cultural circles held a meeting on May 20th to discuss the issue of further developing the struggle against the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group. More than 1,400 cultural and academic workers from Shanghai participated in the meeting.

　　The meeting was presided over by Ba Jin. Zhang Chunqiao, Chen Wangdao, Jin Zhonghua, Shen Zhiyuan, Xiong Foxi, Lu Yudao, Zhou Gucheng, Lin Fengmian, Ding Shande, Yao Wenyuan, Sun Junqing, Zhang Jin Yi, and Wu Qiang spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they stated that from the materials revealed by Shu Wu, they recognized that the mistakes of Hu Feng and his Anti-Party Group were not only ideological but also political. The speakers unanimously expressed infinite indignation at the criminal activities of the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group. They called on the vast cultural and academic workers and people from all walks of life in Shanghai to respond to the call of the "People's Daily" and resolutely fight the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group to the end. At the same time, they also pointed out that the Hu Feng elements in Shanghai must thoroughly confess to the people, provide materials exposing Hu Feng, and be a real person from now on.

　　Finally, Xu Jie spoke on behalf of more than 20 teachers from East China Normal University: Because Hu Feng has consistently been hostile to the Party and the people, he has become an enemy of the people and must be purged from the revolutionary camp. Therefore, they suggested that the conference propose to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that it advise the original electoral unit to revoke Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress; at the same time, suggest to the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles that it revoke Hu Feng's position as a national committee member, and suggest to the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association that it revoke Hu Feng's position as a director of the Chinese Writers Association and a member of the editorial board of "People's Literature," and expel him from membership. This proposal was unanimously approved by the conference.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 20th. After seeing Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group" and Hu Feng's false self-criticism "My Self-Criticism," the members of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Writers Association expressed their utmost indignation at Hu Feng's consistent anti-Party activities and hypocritical self-criticism, and held a symposium on the evening of the 17th. More than 20 writers, including Chen Can Yun, Zhou Gangming, Han Beiping, and Qin Mu, spoke at the meeting. They unanimously believed that Hu Feng had always been wearing the cloak of Marxism and engaging in anti-Party and anti-people activities in literary and art circles, and was a very vicious enemy. They unanimously expressed that they would continue to deeply criticize and struggle against Hu Feng's thoughts and behaviors. The speakers proposed that relevant departments be asked to consider revoking all the positions held by Hu Feng in the Chinese Writers Association, the editorial board of People's Literature, and his positions in people's political life. Because the facts have clearly shown that Hu Feng, who is anti-Party and anti-people, cannot undertake these important tasks.

　　上海和广州文化界人士声讨胡风反党集团 　 建议撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表等资格
    本报上海二十日电　上海市文化界在五月二十日举行大会，讨论对胡风反党集团进一步展开斗争的问题。参加大会的有上海市文化、学术工作者一千四百多人。
    大会由巴金主持。先后在会上发言的有张春桥、陈望道、金仲华、沈志远、熊佛西、卢于道、周谷城、林风眠、丁善德、姚文元、孙峻青、章靳以、吴强。他们在发言中表示，从舒芜所揭发的材料中，认清了胡风及其反党集团的错误，不仅是思想方面的，而且是政治方面的。对胡风反党集团的罪恶活动，发言者一致表示无限愤慨。他们号召上海广大文化学术工作者及各界人民，响应“人民日报”号召坚决向胡风反党集团斗争到底。同时，也指出上海的胡风分子，必须彻底向人民交代，提供揭露胡风的材料，从此做个真正的人。
    最后，许杰代表华东师范大学二十多位教师发言：由于胡风一贯敌视党和人民，他已经成为人民的敌人，必须把他从革命阵营中清洗出去。因此，他们建议大会向全国人民代表大会常务委员会转向原选举单位建议撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表资格；同时向中国文学艺术界联合会主席团建议撤销胡风的全国委员职务，向中国作家协会主席团建议，撤销胡风的中国作家协会理事和“人民文学”编委职务，并开除他的会籍。这个建议，得到大会的一致同意。
    新华社广州二十日电　中国作家协会广州分会的会员们看到舒芜写的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”和胡风的假检讨“我的自我批判”以后，对胡风的一贯的反党活动和伪善的检讨表示万分愤慨，特在十七日晚举行了座谈会。作家陈残云、周钢鸣、韩北屏、秦牧等二十多人在会上发言，他们一致认为，胡风一向披着马克思主义的外衣，在文艺界进行着反党反人民的勾当，是一个十分恶毒的敌人。他们一致表示，要继续深入一步地对胡风的思想行为进行批判和斗争。发言者提议，请各有关部门考虑撤销胡风在中国作家协会、人民文学编委会和他在人民政治生活中所担任的一切职务。因事实已明白地表明，反党、反人民的胡风不能够担负这些重要的工作。
