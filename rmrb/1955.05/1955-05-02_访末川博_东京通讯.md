　　Visiting Hiroshi Suekawa
　　——Tokyo Correspondence——
　　By Our Correspondent Wang Xi
      "Believe in the future, live for the future, where the life of youth resides. The Poseidon statue symbolizes the pain and anger of the young students who were deprived of their precious future and lives under the guise of 'Holy War'." This is the inscription written by Hiroshi Suekawa, President of Ritsumeikan University in Japan, for the "Poseidon Statue" erected on the campus of Ritsumeikan University.
    The Poseidon statue is a bronze statue of a Japanese youth. Young people all over Japan will tell you about the Poseidon statue. The Japanese youth slaughtered by Japanese militarism, riding the raging waves like the Poseidon rising from the sea, marched towards the land of their motherland, roaring in anger. The Poseidon statue is a symbol of Japanese youth opposing the war of aggression and demanding peace. In 1952, under the leadership of the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association, Japanese youth launched an extensive fundraising campaign to sculpt the Poseidon statue to express their determination to oppose militarism. The Poseidon statue was sculpted. Where should this great symbol, embodying the firm will of millions of people, be erected? The authorities of many national universities ignored the requests of the young people. At this moment, Hiroshi Suekawa bravely stepped forward and extended a hand of righteous support to the young people. Since then, the Poseidon statue has stood majestically on the campus of Ritsumeikan University.
    Hiroshi Suekawa is a well-known figure in Japanese cultural and academic circles, a Doctor of Law, and a member of the Science Council of Japan. Many of his academic works have received high acclaim. At the end of 1953, the Special Committee of the Central Education Council of Japan launched a debate on "Neutrality in Education" in the Japanese education circle, attempting to lead the Japanese education circle astray from reality. In the debate, Hiroshi Suekawa insisted that "taking a critical attitude towards the current political economy is the essence of education." Hiroshi Suekawa advocates freedom of academic thought and cooperates with professors and students for this purpose. The Kyoto students' movement against the city's "Public Safety Ordinance" also received his support.
    On the day the Chinese trade delegation arrived in Kyoto, the ancient capital and cultural center of Japan, I visited President Hiroshi Suekawa at Ritsumeikan University.
    This scholar, who bravely supported the Japanese students' demonstration against militarism, began his conversation by saying: "I express my regret for the disasters that Japanese militarism caused to the Chinese people in the past. The Japanese people also deeply regret this. Today is the day of the opening ceremony of Ritsumeikan University. I also said at the student gathering that Japan has committed a serious crime against China in the past. We should deeply remember this lesson and never let this mistake happen again." "The people of Asia should join hands under the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to jointly defend peace in Asia and the world. The conspiracy to use Asians to fight Asians will not be realized."
    I asked him to talk about his views on cultural exchanges between China and Japan. He said: "More than a thousand years ago, Chinese culture was introduced to Japan. Especially in Kyoto, there are traces of Chinese cultural traditions everywhere." Indeed, this ancient city surrounded by mountains preserves many historical monuments of cultural exchanges between China and Japan. We saw a distant view of an ancient temple on Higashiyama, which was one of the earliest Chinese-style temples built when Buddhism was introduced to Japan from China in the Tang Dynasty. We visited famous historical sites such as Nanzen-ji Temple, Kiyomizu-dera Temple, and Ginkaku-ji Temple. Towering pines and cypresses, secluded gardens, small bridges and winding paths, the architecture of the temples... everywhere made us feel the Chinese but also the Japanese flavor. Hiroshi Suekawa said: "About 600 years ago, cultural exchanges between China and Japan became more prosperous. The Japanese people have been deeply influenced by the Chinese cultural tradition in spirit." He mentioned that the Japanese academic and cultural delegation to China, which visited China last year, told him after returning to China that New China's academic and cultural progress is very rapid, and to understand or study Chinese culture, it is necessary to visit it once a year. He said: Japanese scholars very much hope to travel freely to and from China, and Japanese students also ask to cooperate friendly with neighboring country students. "However, Japan is not yet fully independent. Just as economic exchanges cannot be normal, cultural exchanges are also hindered, which is very regrettable. I think that to allow scholars and young students from China and Japan to travel freely, learn from each other, and learn from each other's strengths as soon as possible, we must restore diplomatic relations between the two countries. Japan should become a peaceful country and must not go to China with guns like it did more than ten years ago."
    He continued: "China's door to cultural cooperation with other countries is open. Today, what hinders cultural exchanges between China and Japan and further development of trade relations between the two countries are political and artificial obstacles, and these obstacles are on the Japanese side. The Japanese people are working hard to break down this barrier. It is precisely because the power of the Japanese people to demand the establishment of friendly relations with the Chinese people is growing, that the Hatoyama government has also proposed to adjust relations with China. However, to make it a reality, the Japanese people still have to make greater efforts."
    During my short visit to Japan, I met many Japanese university presidents, professors, scholars, journalists, and cultural workers, all of whom expressed a strong desire to study and understand New China. Hiroshi Suekawa also introduced to me the situation of Kyoto universities studying and lecturing on Chinese literature, thought, as well as political and economic issues. He said: "The achievements of your country's construction in all aspects are a great encouragement to the Japanese people. In the current era, Japanese cultural and academic figures who want to further their studies should go to China like they go to Germany, France, Britain, and Italy to study." "We not only hope that international students can travel freely, but also hope to establish a relationship of mutual exchange of cultural research materials as soon as possible." He especially hoped that the Chinese Academy of Sciences could establish this relationship with Japanese universities and academic research institutions. He cited the example of "simplified Chinese characters" and said that China is the birthplace of Chinese characters, and Japan is learning from China. Now both China and Japan are carrying out this work, and the Science Council of Japan hopes to receive notification of China's simplified Chinese character plan.
    The scheduled end of the visit arrived. President Hiroshi Suekawa led me to visit the Poseidon statue. The new students of Ritsumeikan University were clustered around the Poseidon statue, looking up at it.

　　访末川博
　　——东京通讯——
　　本报记者　汪溪
      “相信未来，为未来而生活，那里有青年的生命。海神像象征着在‘圣战’的美名下被夺去了珍贵的未来和生命的青年学生的悲痛和愤怒。”这是日本立命馆大学校长末川博为竖立在立命馆大学校园里的“海神像”所写的题词。
    海神像是一座青铜制的日本青年的立像。全日本的青年都会告诉你海神像。被日本军国主义屠杀的日本青年，乘着汹涌的海涛像海神从海里升起似的，走向祖国的土地，发出了怒吼。海神像是日本青年反对侵略战争，要求和平的标志。一九五二年，在全日本学生自治会总联合会的领导下，日本青年为了表示他们反对军国主义的决心，进行了广泛的为塑造海神像募集基金的运动。海神像塑造好了。这个凝结着千百万人们的坚强意志的伟大象征品，竖立在什么地方好呢？许多国立大学校的当局，对青年们的请求置之不理。这时，末川博毅然地挺身而出，向青年们伸出了正义的支援的手。海神像从此就在立命馆大学的校园里巍然屹立着。
    末川博是日本的文化学术界的名人，法学博士，日本学术会议的会员。他在学术上的不少著作得到了很高的评价。一九五三年年底，日本中央教育审议会特别委员会在日本教育界中发动了关于“教育中立论”的论辩，企图将日本教育界引上脱离现实的迷途。末川博在论战中坚持主张“对当前的政治经济采取批判的态度是教育的本质。”末川博主张学术思想自由，并为此同教授和学生合作。京都学生反对该市“治安条例”的运动，也得到了他的支持。
    中国贸易代表团到达日本的故都和文化中心城市——京都的那一天，我到立命馆大学校访问了末川博校长。
    这位勇敢地支持了日本学生向军国主义示威行动的学者，这样开始了他的谈话：“我对于过去日本军国主义给中国人民造成的灾难，表示遗憾。日本人民也是深深以此为憾的。今天是立命馆大学举行开学典礼的日子，我在学生集会上也说，日本过去对中国是有深重的罪过的，我们应该痛切地记取这个教训，决不让这种错误重演。”“亚洲人民应该在和平共处的五项原则下携起手来，共同保卫亚洲和世界的和平。想以亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋是不会实现的。”
    我请他谈谈对中日两国进行文化交流的意见。他说：“一千多年以前，中国文化就输入了日本。尤其是在京都，到处都有中国文化传统的遗迹。”的确，这座为群山环抱的古城，保存了不少中日两国文化交流的历史纪念物。我们远远的看到东山上有一座古庙，那是在我国唐朝时佛教传入日本，最早建造起来的中国式的庙宇之一。我们参观了南禅寺、清水寺、银阁寺等名胜古迹。参天的松柏，幽静的庭园，小桥曲径，庙堂的建筑……处处使我们感到了中国的但又是日本的风味。末川博说：“约六百年前，中日两国文化交流更加繁盛起来。日本人民在精神上深受中国文化传统的影响。”他提到了去年访问过中国的日本学术文化访华代表团回国后，曾向他说，新中国的学术文化进步很快，要了解或研究中国文化，非每年去访问一次不行。他说：日本的学者很希望能同中国自由来往，日本学生也要求同邻国学生友好合作。“但是，日本还没有完全独立，正像经济来往不能正常一样，文化上的交流也受到阻碍，这是很令人痛心的。我想，要及早地让中日两国的学者和青年学生自由地往返，互相学习，取长补短，就要恢复两国的邦交。日本应该成为和平的国家，决不能像十多年前那样带着枪炮到中国去。”
    他继续说道：“中国和各国的文化合作的门户是开放着的。今天阻碍中日文化交流的，阻碍两国的贸易关系进一步发展的，是政治性的人为的障碍，这种障碍是在日本方面。日本人民正在努力打破这个障碍。正是由于日本人民要求同中国人民建立友好关系的力量越来越大了，以致鸠山政府也提出了要调整同中国的关系。但是，要使它实现，日本人民还要作更大的努力。”
    在访问日本短短的期间，我遇到了许多日本的大学校长、教授、学者、新闻工作者和文化工作者，他们都表示了要求研究并了解新中国的强烈的愿望。末川博也向我介绍了京都各大学研究和讲授中国文学、思想、以及政治、经济问题的情形。他说：“你们的国家各方面建设的成就，对日本人民是很大的鼓舞，现在的时代，日本文化学术界人士要想深造，就应该像到德国、法国、英国、意大利去留学一样地到中国去。”“我们不但希望留学生可以自由地来往，更希望能尽早地建立互相交换文化研究资料的关系。”他特别提出希望中国科学院能和日本的大学和学术研究机构建立起这种关系，他举了“汉字简化”的例子说，中国是汉字的发源地，日本是向中国学习的。现在中日两国都在进行这项工作，日本学术会议希望得到中国简化汉字方案的通知。
    预定结束访问的时间到了。末川博校长引领我去参观海神像。立命馆大学的新生成群地围在海神像前仰首瞻望着。
