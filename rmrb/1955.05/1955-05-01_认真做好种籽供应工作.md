Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Seed Supply
　　Jingzhou Prefecture's Seed Distribution Has Too Many Restrictions

Editor:
    Many areas of Jingzhou Prefecture, Hubei Province, suffered from floods in 1954, resulting in a shortage of seeds. Therefore, before this year's spring plowing, the government transferred a large number of seeds from distant provinces and districts such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Xiangyang, and Yichang to support production in the disaster areas. However, after the seeds were transferred, many chaotic situations occurred in the supply work of many counties and districts: (1) Supply was not timely. After Tie Niu Township in the First District of Honghu County conducted a review of seed supply, it organized more than 500 people to buy seeds in Xindi, but because the supply tickets were not issued in time, they made a wasted trip and returned empty-handed. In Cenhe District of Jiangling County, the supply books for thirteen out of fifteen townships had not been made up by early April. (2) Supply procedures were cumbersome. Relevant departments in Jianli County stipulated that people who bought seeds had to fill out cards, seed tickets, and triplicate forms. As a result of this "not afraid of trouble," four cadres in Zhengda Township spent eleven days handling the seed supply for only three electoral districts (already simplified). Songzi County Second District stipulates "three nos" for seed supply: those with loan balances inconsistent on the triplicate forms will not be sold to, those without loan vouchers will not be sold to, those with credit cooperative stamps on the forms but without township government stamps will not be sold to. More than 200 people in Hepingzha Township went to Shadaoguan to buy seeds, but because the loan odd numbers were inconsistent, they did not buy them, and spent twelve yuan on travel expenses in vain. (3) Blindly increasing the supply of seeds or rigidly stipulating supply quotas. In the Twelfth District of Mianyang County, the expansion of supply quotas resulted in two townships not receiving seed tickets. Wenjiachao Township in the Third District of Songzi County rigidly stipulated that 45% of early rice and 50% of mid-season rice should be supplied, causing difficulties for the masses to buy seeds, as well as out-of-stock and mispricing confusion.
    This is not the first time that such a situation has occurred in Jingzhou Prefecture. During the winter planting period last year, some areas had too few supply points, and the masses lined up to buy seeds, which were extremely crowded; while other areas had a large number of seeds piled up in warehouses. However, the relevant departments still did not learn from this, and still regarded seed supply as a purely commercial work, instead of treating it as a arduous political and organizational work at the same time. Therefore, they considered it "all is well" after the seeds were transferred to the county according to the plan. As for whether the masses can buy seeds in a timely and convenient manner, it seems that it is only the masses' own business and not the business of the commercial departments. Wu Ruijie

　　Why Cotton Seeds Have Not Been Distributed to Liaoyang

    In 1954, Liaoyang County suffered from cotton disasters, so cotton seeds were in great shortage in 1955. In order to solve the problem of seed shortage for cotton farmers and ensure the cotton planting area, Liaoning Province decided to allocate 600,000 catties of cotton seeds from Gaiping County, and the Provincial Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, and the Provincial Cooperative issued a joint notice.
    On February 4, the Liaoyang County Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry received the notice and put forward a plan for distributing the cotton seeds, requesting the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company to be responsible for the transfer and distribution of cotton seeds from the station to the grassroots cooperatives, and requesting the County Cooperative to help with consignment sales. At that time, the County Cooperative insisted that it could only transport on behalf of them and could not sell on consignment, and the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company advocated transporting the cotton seeds to Liaoyang County, and in accordance with the regulations of the higher authorities, they would not sell on credit, and would have to pay cash for delivery. It is said that this was also the opinion of the Provincial Department of Commerce.
    Why did the commercial department insist on transporting it to Liaoyang County and refused to distribute it to the small stations? It turned out that the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company believed that they were business units, selling cotton seeds was a business, sitting in Liaoyang County to deliver goods, calling farmers to come from dozens of miles away to transport by carts, one hand for money, one hand for goods, saving worry and trouble. The Cooperative believes that the distribution of cotton seeds is a matter for the agricultural department, and the cooperative is only helping. If it is possible not to go through the cooperative and let the farmers come to collect the goods by themselves, that would be the best thing.
      Obviously, it is very difficult to concentrate the cotton seeds in Liaoyang County and then ask the farmers to come to Liaoyang County to buy them. However, the cadres of the commercial department cannot understand this at all. Because the problem could not be solved, the three departments each sent people to Shenyang to find their superiors on February 19. Who knew that Director Wang of the Department of Agriculture and the Director of the Department of Commerce personally negotiated on the phone, but still there was no result. They had to call everyone back and wait to ask the governor to solve it.
    Speaking of which, it was February 26 again, and Liu, the section chief of the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, told the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry that if the agricultural department could guarantee that the cotton seeds would be taken away within 24 hours after the goods arrived at the small station, the cotton seeds would be transported to the small station, but not on credit. However, the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry did not have the ability to organize hundreds of farmers to bring carts and cash to transport the cotton seeds away within 24 hours. So this clever plan had to be abandoned.
    Cotton planting is seasonal, how can we slowly wait for research? The County Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry had no choice but to raise the issue of responsibility for affecting cotton planting. Thus, after the three departments held nine meetings, sent people to the province to ask for instructions six or seven times, and countless small contacts, the problem was finally agreed upon after forty days. Originally unwilling to sell on credit, now they also agreed to sell on credit. Due to the entanglement of the commercial department, the cotton seeds, which were originally planned to be basically distributed to the villages by March 15, had not been shipped from Gaiping County until March 21.
    What is the reason that made the 600,000 catties of cotton seeds unable to be distributed for so long and entangled for so long? It's just that the relevant commercial departments can only talk about serving the socialist transformation of agriculture and serving agricultural production, but in fact they don't want to do it so seriously!

### 认真做好种籽供应工作

　　认真做好种籽供应工作
　　荆州专区发放种籽限制太多编辑同志：
    湖北荆州专区一九五四年有不少地区遭受了水灾，种籽缺乏，因此今年春耕生产前，政府就从浙江、江苏、襄阳、宜昌等省、区远道调来了大批种籽支援灾区生产。但是种籽调来以后，不少县区的供应工作出现了很多混乱情况：（一）供应不及时。洪湖县一区铁牛乡进行了种籽供应的评议工作后，组织了五百多人到新堤去买种籽，但因供应票没有及时发下去，使他们白跑了一趟又空手回来了。江陵县岑河区十五个乡，有十三个乡的供应册到四月上旬还没有造起来。（二）供应手续繁杂。监利县有关部门规定群众买种籽要填卡片、种籽票和三联单，这样“不惮其繁”的结果，使郑大乡的四个干部忙碌了十一天只办了三个选区的种籽供应（已简化）。松滋县二区供应种籽规定“三不卖”：三联单上贷款尾数不符的不卖，没有贷款凭册的不卖，单册上有信用合作社的图章而没有乡政府的图章的不卖。和平闸乡二百多个群众到沙道观去买种籽，就是因为贷款零数不符，没有买到，白白花去路费十二元。（三）盲目提高供应种籽量或硬性规定供应指标。沔阳县十二区因扩大供应指标，使两个乡没有领到种籽票。松滋县三区温家潮乡硬性规定供应早谷百分之四十五，供应中谷百分之五十，造成群众买种籽的困难而外，还有脱销、错价等混乱情况。
    荆州专区发生这类情况已经不是第一次了，去年冬种时期，有的地区由于供应点少，群众排队买种籽，拥挤不堪；有的地区却有大批种籽积存在仓库里。但是有关部门仍然没有从中吸取教训，仍然把种籽供应工作看作是一个单纯的商业工作，而不把它同时看作是一个艰巨的政治工作和组织工作，因而他们把种籽按计划调运到县以后就“百事大吉”了，至于群众能不能及时地、便利地买到种籽，似乎那只是群众自己的事而不是商业部门的事。伍瑞阶
　　为什么棉籽迟迟发不到辽阳
    一九五四年辽阳县棉花受了灾，因而一九五五年棉种十分缺乏。为了解决棉农缺种的困难，保证植棉面积，辽宁省决定由盖平县拨去棉籽六十万斤，并由省商业厅、农业厅、省合作社发出联合通知。
    二月四日辽阳县农林局接到通知，就提出了分运棉籽的计划，要求花纱布公司负责调运，把棉籽由车站拨给基层社去；要求县合作社帮助代销。当时，县合作社坚持只能代运，不能代销，花纱布公司主张把棉籽运到辽阳县来，并且按上级规定不赊，要发货就得要现钱。据说省商业厅的意见也是这样。
    为什么商业部门一直要坚持运到辽阳县而不肯分运到各小站呢？原来花纱布公司认为他们是企业单位，卖棉籽是买卖，坐在辽阳县发货，叫农民赶大车从几十里外来运，一手钱，一手货，省心省事，不麻烦。合作社认为：发放棉籽是农业部门的事，合作社不过是帮忙而已，如果能够不通过合作社，叫农民自己赶车来领，那是最好的事了。
      很显然，要把棉籽集中到辽阳县来，然后再叫农民到辽阳县来购买是有很多困难的。但是，商业部门的干部根本不能体谅这一点。由于问题不得解决，三个部门就在二月十九日各自派人到沈阳找上级。谁知，农业厅王厅长和商业厅厅长亲自在电话上交涉了一番，也仍然没有结果。只好叫大家回来，等请示省长解决。
    说说又到二月二十六日了，花纱布公司刘股长告诉农林局说：如果农业部门能保证，在货到小站后二十四小时之内拉走，棉籽就往小站运，但不赊账。但是，要组织农民出动上百台大车、带上现钱、在二十四小时内把棉籽运走，农林局可没有这么大的神通。于是这条妙计又只好作罢。
    棉花的栽种是有季节性的，怎能慢慢地等待研究？县农林局没有办法，只好提出影响植棉的责任问题，这样经过三个部门开会九次，派人到省请示六、七次，小接触不计其数，历时四十天，问题总算达成协议了。原来不肯赊账的，现在也同意赊账了。由于商业部门的纠缠，原来打算要在三月十五日基本上发放到村的棉籽，直到三月二十一日还没有从盖平县起运。
    究竟是什么原因使得六十万斤棉籽迟迟不能发下去、纠缠了这么久呢？只不过是有关的商业部门只能口头上讲讲为农业社会主义改造服务，为农业生产服务，而实际上并不想那样认真去做罢了！
