　　West German Militarists About to Begin...
　　Xi Linsheng
    The United States, Britain, and France have announced that the Paris Agreements will come into effect on May 5th. They are about to formally implement plans to rearm West Germany.

    The implementation of the Paris Agreements opens the door to the revival of German militarism. From now on, West German militarists can blatantly carry out the plot of rearmament.

    Since the surrender of Hitler's Germany, West German militarist forces have been conducting re-militarization activities under the protection and support of the United States and other Western occupying powers. More than 450,000 former Nazi officers and soldiers have been placed in police forces and other military units of various names; in addition, another 2 million people are lurking in more than 700 militarist organizations. In terms of military production, the war industry has been preserved almost intact. Not long after the end of the war, West German factories began manufacturing munitions again, and last year's output of West Germany's main military supplies greatly exceeded the level of 1936. At least 400 factories are now producing weapons and equipment such as armor plates, helmets, high-explosive mines, incendiary bombs, hand grenades, military vehicles, and submarine equipment.

    Now, West German militarists can openly rearm on this basis. It is revealed that West Germany will use more than 100 billion marks in military spending over the next three years to rebuild the "Bundeswehr." This military expenditure is more than 25 billion marks more than the cost of Hitler's establishment of the "Bundeswehr" in six years. The Bonn clique has impatiently announced a timetable for rearmament, preparing to establish a core force of 150,000-strong "Bundeswehr" this autumn, and recruit 350,000 new soldiers every year thereafter. To achieve this goal, the Bonn government intends to submit a series of military bills to the parliament in early May, including the recruitment of long-term volunteers and the implementation of universal conscription. At the same time, the West German government is also preparing to establish a "Ministry of Military Affairs" led by former Hitler's Nazi generals Heusinger, Manteuffel, and others before mid-May. In order to cultivate future "Bundeswehr" officers as soon as possible, the Bonn revanchists will formally establish military academies for the army, navy, and air force. According to a recent report by Agence France-Presse, West Germany has stored enough weapons, ammunition, and equipment to supply half of the West German army. At the same time, the United States is also ready to supply West Germany with 3 billion US dollars worth of equipment free of charge. Therefore, from all aspects, the Bonn clique and Washington's aggressive forces are actively trying to turn West Germany back into a heavily armed country in the shortest possible time.

    While rebuilding the West German aggressor army, the Bonn clique is also preparing to restore arms production on a large scale. According to West German news agencies, recent negotiations between the Bonn government and the Western occupying powers on allowing West Germany to start arms production have made progress. The "Federal Aviation Office," responsible for organizing aircraft production, has been formally established in Braunschweig. About 26 aircraft factories are ready for aircraft production, among which famous aircraft manufacturers such as Messerschmitt and Heinkel are planning to resume large-scale aircraft production after June 1st. Krupp factories are ready to start producing diesel engines for submarines. At the same time, preparations have also been made in West Germany for the production of guided missiles. Recently, the Bonn government's Ministry of Economic Affairs and the "Blank Office" are preparing to form a special "Armaments Committee" to comprehensively start up West Germany's arms industry machine.

    In order to deceive the people, Western countries and the Bonn government have constantly publicized that the "restrictions" and "supervision" system of the Paris Agreements "will provide reliable guarantees to prevent militarization." But the facts prove that this "guarantee" is completely false. An official bulletin of the West German government press office revealed at the beginning of this year that the Bonn government is preparing to establish a "second Bundeswehr - militia" plan. The "militia" established according to this plan will be composed of professional soldiers and equipped with the same weapons as the regular army. It can be seen that the Paris Agreements' restrictions on the number of West German troops are worthless. As for the provisions of the Paris Agreements prohibiting West Germany from producing certain heavy weapons and weapons of mass destruction such as atomic weapons and chemical weapons, they are also ineffective. The Bonn government is circumventing the Paris Agreements and has reached an agreement with the Spanish government to establish Spanish-West German joint ventures in Spain, supervised by West German experts, to manufacture atomic weapons. West German arms dealers do not abandon the plan to manufacture heavy weapons and atomic weapons in West Germany because of the provisions of the Paris Agreements. Sixteen major West German companies have organized a "Physics Research Society" with a capital of 1.6 million marks, hoping to establish an "Atomic Research Center" in 1955. Adenauer has publicly announced that West Germany will build its first atomic pile in the near future. This equipment, in the name of research, will prepare all the scientific and technological conditions for the production of atomic weapons. Even before the Paris Agreements came into effect, West Germany was already manufacturing ships that the Paris Agreements did not allow to be manufactured; the Krupp factory also built an atomic cannon, preparing to carry out large-scale production after the Paris Agreements came into effect.

    History proves that German militarists do not take the constraints of agreements or treaties to heart at all. They only use them as a cover and openly abandon them when they deem it favorable. In fact, Heusinger, who is designated as the chief of staff of the West German "Bundeswehr," is now saying without any scruples: "Germany once trained the cadres it needed on the basis of the 100,000 troops stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles. Wouldn't it be much faster to train the cadres it needs on the basis of an army of 500,000 people now?" Blank, the de facto Minister of Defense of West Germany, said even more bluntly: "Once the Federal Republic has twelve divisions and many 'security' forces, nothing and no one in the world can stop it from building more troops." Former Nazi General Zimmermann has been openly advocating the need to use atomic weapons to launch a preemptive war. It can be seen that the implementation of the Paris Agreements can only greatly increase the crisis of German militarism carrying out new aggression and launching a new war, and this war will be an atomic war.

    The implementation of the Paris Agreements has obviously caused a fundamental change in the European situation. Peace-loving people in all countries have made a correct assessment of the new war threat that has increased as a result. They are uniting more closely and mobilizing to stop this threat. The Soviet Union and other European peace-loving countries that participated in the Moscow meeting last November have decided to hold a second meeting in Warsaw on May 11 to discuss the conclusion of a treaty of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance between the eight countries and the organization of the joint command of the treaty participating countries. The actions taken by the Soviet Union and other eight countries to take joint defense measures are of great significance for ensuring the security of these countries and ensuring peace in Europe. Therefore, it is completely in line with the wishes of the European people, and it will be supported and supported by the broad masses of the European people.

    Encouraged and supported by the aggressive forces of the United States and Britain, West German militarists are following Hitler's old path. However, today's Germany is no longer the Germany after the First World War, and today's Europe is not the Europe before the Second World War. The power of peace-loving people is even stronger. The instigators of a new war in Europe will inevitably suffer a fate much more tragic than Hitler's.

### 西德军国主义者要开始了……

　　西德军国主义者要开始了……
　　席林生
    美英法三国已经宣布巴黎协定在五月五日生效。它们正在要把重新武装西德的计划正式付诸实施。
    巴黎协定的实施，为德国军国主义的复活打开了大门。从现在起，西德军国主义者便可以明目张胆地进行重新武装的勾当。
    自从希特勒德国投降以后，西德军国主义势力一直在美国和其他西方占领国的庇护和扶植之下，进行重新军国主义化的活动。有四十五万以上的前纳粹官兵被安置在警察部队和其他各种名目的军事单位里；另外还有二百万人隐伏在七百多个军国主义组织之中。在军事生产方面，战争工业被差不多完整无损地保存下来。战争才结束不久，西德的工厂就又开始制造军火，去年西德主要军用物资的产量已大大超过一九三六年的水平。现在至少有四百家工厂在生产装甲钢板、钢盔、烈性地雷、燃烧弹、手榴弹、军用汽车和潜水艇设备等武器和装备。
    现在，西德军国主义者更可以在这样的基础上，公开地进行重新武装了。据透露，西德在最近三年内将用一千多亿马克的军事费用来重建“国防军”。这笔军费比希特勒在六年内建立“国防军”的费用还要多两百五十多亿马克。波恩集团已经迫不及待地宣布了重新武装的时间表，准备在今年秋天就建立起一支十五万人的“国防军”的骨干部队，并在今后每年征集三十五万名新兵。为了达到这个目的，波恩政府打算在五月初向议会提出一系列包括召募长期志愿兵和实施普遍兵役制的军事法案。同时西德政府还准备在五月中旬前建立由前希特勒的纳粹将军许辛格、曼陀菲尔等人领导的“军事部”。为了尽快培养未来“国防军”的军官，波恩复仇主义者并将正式建立陆、海、空军的军事学院。据法新社最近报道，西德已储存了足以供给西德军队半数的武器、军火和装备。同时美国也准备好三十亿美元的装备无代价供应西德。因此，从各方面看来，波恩集团和华盛顿的侵略势力正积极地要把西德在最短期间重新变成一个武装到牙齿的国家。
    在重建西德侵略军队的同时，波恩集团还准备大规模恢复军火生产。据西德的通讯社报道，最近波恩政府和西方占领国家关于准许西德开始军火生产的谈判已经取得了进展。负责组织飞机生产的
  “联邦空运处”已经在不伦瑞克正式成立。约有二十六个飞机工厂已作好飞机生产的准备，其中如麦塞施米特、亨克尔等著名的飞机制造商正计划在六月一日以后就恢复大规模飞机生产。克虏伯工厂已经准备开始生产潜水艇的柴油发动机。同时，在西德也已经做好了生产定向飞弹的准备工作。最近波恩政府经济部和“布兰克部”正着手组成专门的
  “军备委员会”，准备全面开动西德的军火工业机器。
    西方国家和波恩政府为了欺骗人民，曾不断宣传说巴黎协定的“限制”和“监督”制度“将提供防止军国主义化的可靠保证”。但是事实证明这种“保证”是完全虚假的。西德政府新闻处官方公报今年年初透露，波恩政府正在准备建立“第二国防军——民兵”的计划。根据这个计划建立起来的“民兵”将由职业士兵组成，并装备有和正规军同样的武器。由此可见，巴黎协定关于西德军队数量的限制，是毫无价值的。至于巴黎协定关于禁止西德生产某些重型武器和原子武器、化学武器等大规模毁灭性武器的规定，也是不起任何作用的。波恩政府正在绕过巴黎协定，和西班牙政府取得协议，在西班牙设立受西德专家监督的西班牙—西德合营企业，制造原子武器。西德军火商人也并不因巴黎协定的规定就放弃在西德就地制造重武器和原子武器的计划。西德十六家大公司已组织了一个拥有资本一百六十万马克的“物理学研究社”，以期在一九五五年建立一个“原子研究中心”。阿登纳曾公开宣布，西德在最近期内将建立第一个原子堆。这种以研究为名的设备将为生产原子武器准备好科学和技术的一切条件。甚至还在巴黎协定生效以前，西德就已经在制造巴黎协定所不准制造的舰只；克虏伯工厂并造出了一座原子炮，准备在巴黎协定生效后，大规模进行生产。
    历史证明，德国军国主义分子是根本不把协定或条约的约束放在心里的。它只是利用它们来作掩护，并在它认为有利的时候来公开加以废弃。事实上，内定为西德“国防军”参谋长的许辛格现在就毫无顾忌地在说：“德国曾经在凡尔赛条约所规定的十万军队的基础上训练出它所需要的干部，现在以一支五十万人的军队为基础来训练它所需要的干部，岂不会快得多。”西德实际上的国防部长布兰克说得更为露骨：“一旦联邦共和国有了十二个师和许多‘保安’部队，世界上就没有任何东西和任何人能阻止它建立更多的军队了。”前纳粹将领齐麦尔曼已经在公开鼓吹必须使用原子武器发动先发制人的战争。由此可见，巴黎协定的实施只能使德国军国主义进行新的侵略和发动新战争的危机大大增加起来，这场战争并将是一场原子战争。
    巴黎协定的实施显然要使欧洲局势发生了根本的变化，各国爱好和平人民对于因此而增加的新战争威胁，作了正确的估计。他们正更紧密地团结一致，动员起来制止这个威胁。苏联和参加去年十一月莫斯科会议的其他欧洲爱好和平国家已决定于五月十一日在华沙召开第二次会议，讨论八国间缔结友好、合作和互助条约以及组织条约参加国的联合司令部的问题。苏联等八国采取共同防御措施的行动对于保障这些国家的安全和保障欧洲的和平有着巨大的意义。因此它是完全符合欧洲人民的愿望的，它将获得欧洲广大人民的拥护和支持。
    西德军国主义者得到美英侵略势力的鼓励和扶植，正在走着希特勒的旧路。然而今天的德国已经不是第一次世界大战以后的德国，今天的欧洲也不是第二次世界大战以前的欧洲。和平人民的力量是更加强大了。欧洲新战争的发动者，必然会遭到比希特勒悲惨得多的命运。
