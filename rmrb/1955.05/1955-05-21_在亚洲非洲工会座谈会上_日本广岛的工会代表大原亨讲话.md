　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Mr. Ohara Toru, the trade union representative from Hiroshima, Japan, attending the Asian-African Trade Union Conference, spoke at the conference on the 18th on behalf of the people of Hiroshima who suffered from the atomic bomb disaster, calling for a ban on the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and proposing that the tenth anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima be commemorated on August 6th of this year. This proposal received deep sympathy and support from trade union representatives from various countries.
　　Ohara Toru said: An atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, wiping out many people in Hiroshima, and Nagasaki, Japan, also suffered an atomic bomb disaster on August 9th. Some of the people who did not die when Hiroshima suffered the atomic bomb disaster are still suffering from atomic diseases. We oppose the use of hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs, and we ask the US government and the Japanese government to ban the use of hydrogen and atomic weapons, but the Japanese government has not accepted this. Last March, the United States tested a hydrogen bomb on Bikini Island, causing another disaster for Japanese fishermen.
　　Ohara Toru said that demanding a ban on the use of atomic weapons is now a major issue concerning whether humanity can move towards a happy path, and we all clearly know that atomic bombs will destroy the lives of workers. He also said: I believe that workers in oppressed countries will oppose the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. At the same time, in order to defend peace and peaceful coexistence between countries, it is necessary to further strengthen the friendship and unity of Asian and African workers.
　　On behalf of the Japanese trade union delegation, Ohara Toru suggested holding a worldwide peace-loving anti-atomic bomb conference on August 6th of this year, and holding a conference against atomic and hydrogen weapons in Hiroshima. He called on the trade union forces of all countries to unite and oppose the imperialists who are preparing for atomic and hydrogen weapons wars.

　　在亚洲非洲工会座谈会上
　　日本广岛的工会代表大原亨讲话
    新华社二十日讯　参加亚洲非洲工会座谈会的日本广岛的工会代表大原亨，在十八日的座谈会上代表遭受原子弹灾害的广岛人民呼吁禁止使用原子武器和氢武器，并提议在今年的八月六日纪念广岛遭受原子弹轰炸的十周年。这一建议得到了各国工会代表的深切同情和支持。
    大原亨说：一九四五年八月六日在广岛投下了原子弹，使广岛的许多人民被消灭，日本长崎也相继在八月九日遭到原子弹的灾害。在广岛受到原子弹灾害当时没有死的人们，有些现在仍然患着原子核的病症。我们反对使用氢弹和原子弹，我们要求美国政府和日本政府禁止使用氢武器和原子武器，但日本政府并没有接受。去年三月美国在比基尼岛试验了氢弹，又使日本渔民受到灾害。
    大原亨说，现在要求禁止使用原子武器是有关人类能否走向幸福道路的重大问题，我们大家都清楚地知道原子弹会破坏工人的生活。他又说：我相信被压迫国家的工人都会反对使用原子武器和氢武器。同时为了保卫和平和各国之间的和平共处，要更加加强亚非工人的友好和团结。
    大原亨代表日本工会代表团建议在今年八月六日召开全世界爱好和平反对原子弹会议，在广岛举行反对原子武器和氢武器的会议。他呼吁各国工会力量团结在一起，反对准备原子武器和氢武器战争的帝国主义者。
