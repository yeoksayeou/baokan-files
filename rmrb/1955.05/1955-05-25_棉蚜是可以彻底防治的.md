Cotton Aphids Can Be Completely Controlled
　　Zhang Guangxue

    Liu Dongbao, a farmer from Houbaibi Village, Anyang County, Henan Province, has over three mu of cotton fields. This land is very close to the village, and next to it are two pits full of weeds (covering about half a mu of land in total). As a result, cotton aphids have been a serious problem every year, and many people call this land "Ant Sweat Head."

    In 1949, the cotton planted on this land was plowed and destroyed due to severe aphid infestation. From 1951 to 1953, aphid infestations were very serious. By 1953, after using tobacco water to control the aphids once after the wheat harvest, the yield per mu increased from 30 jin in 1951 to 80 jin of seed cotton. However, due to the low yields in the previous two years, the average yield for the three years was still only 57.7 jin.

    At the end of 1953, Liu Dongbao joined the Hongxia Agricultural Production Cooperative, and his land also became part of the cooperative. In the spring of 1954, when the cooperative members were planning the planting, they did not advocate planting cotton on this land. After the staff introduced comprehensive methods for controlling cotton aphids, everyone decided to try planting.

    Starting in early spring of 1954, the cooperative began a series of measures to control cotton aphids: Before Qingming Festival, the weeds in the two large pits next to the land were cleared twice in conjunction with accumulating fertilizer; after the cotton seedlings emerged completely, the new thinning method was used to pull out and bury some of the cotton seedlings with aphids; in early May, combined with the second thinning, 0.5% "666" powder was used to control the aphid-infested cotton plants once; in mid-May and early June, the same "666" powder was used for a general control application; in mid-June and late June, 6% wettable "666" and "1605" were used for a general control application. By adopting measures such as weeding, thinning, and chemical control, the cotton aphids on this famous "Ant Sweat Head" land were brought under control, and a bumper harvest was achieved. The average yield of seed cotton per mu was 320 jin, an increase of more than 454% compared to the average yield of the past three years. The main reasons for the increased production of this cotton field were two: one was that the agricultural cooperative improved the cultivation of this land, especially in pruning and branching, which was done twice as much as in the past; the other was the active control of cotton aphids.

    Although this was more labor-intensive and costly, the overall benefits were still great. In 1954, the labor cost per mu for aphid control was 2.5 workdays more than in the past. At 8 jiao per workday, this was an additional labor cost of 2 yuan per mu; a total of 9 jin of 0.5% "666" powder was used per mu, totaling 1.71 yuan, 0.5 jin of 6% wettable "666" was used, costing 0.45 yuan, and 3 cubic centimeters of "1605" was used, costing 0.15 yuan. From the above calculations, the additional labor and material costs for controlling cotton aphids were 4.31 yuan per mu. In the past three years, this land averaged only 57.7 jin of seed cotton per mu, which, at 0.28 yuan per jin, had a total value of 16.16 yuan. In 1954, the average yield was 320 jin per mu, with a total value of 89.6 yuan. Deducting the labor and material costs, the profit per mu was 85.29 yuan, which is more than five times the average income of the past three years.

### 棉蚜是可以彻底防治的

　　棉蚜是可以彻底防治的
　　张广学
    河南省安阳县后白壁村农民刘东宝有一块三亩多的棉地。这块地离村很近，地旁又有满生杂草的土坑两个（约共有半亩地），所以年年棉蚜为害严重，许多人把这块地叫做“蚁汗头”。
    一九四九年在这块地上种的棉花因棉蚜为害过分严重而犁毁；从一九五一年到一九五三年三年中，棉蚜为害都很严重。到一九五三年，由于在麦收后，用烟叶水防治一遍，每亩产量就由一九五一年的三十斤增加到八十斤籽棉。但由于前两年产量低，三年的平均产量仍然只有五十七点七斤。
    一九五三年底刘东宝参加了红霞农业生产合作社，他的这块地也随着入了社。一九五四年春这个社的社员们在计划播种时，都不主张在这块地上种棉花，经过工作人员介绍防治棉蚜的综合办法后，大家才决定种上试试看。
    这个社由一九五四年初春开始了一系列的防治棉蚜的工作：清明前结合积肥对这块地旁两个大坑内的杂草清除了两次；棉苗出齐后，用新间苗法把一部分有蚜虫的棉苗拔去埋掉；五月上旬结合二次间苗，用百分之零点五的“六六六”粉，对有蚜虫的棉株防治了一遍；五月中旬和六月上旬又用同样的“六六六”粉各普遍防治一遍；六月中旬和六月下旬又各用百分之六的可湿性“六六六”和“一六○五”各普遍防治一遍。经过采用除草、间苗、药剂等防治措施，结果这块有名的“蚁汗头”地的棉蚜被治下去了，并且获得了丰收，平均每亩棉田收籽棉三百二十斤，比过去三年的平均产量增产百分之四百五十四多。这块棉花地增产的主要原因有两个，一个是农业合作社对这块地的耕作有改进，特别是在整枝打杈上比过去多做了两遍；另一个是积极地防治了棉蚜。
    这样做虽然比较费工、费钱，但是总的说收益还是大的。这块地一九五四年因防治蚜虫所费的人工每亩比过去多两个半工，以每日每工八角计算，每亩多用人工费二元；每亩共用百分之零点五的“六六六”粉九斤，合计是一元七角一分，用百分之六可湿性“六六六”半斤，计四角五分，用“一六○五”三立方公分，计一角五分。从以上的花费计算，因防治棉蚜每亩棉田多用人工和药费四元三角一分。过去三年这块地每亩平均只收籽棉五十七点七斤，以每斤两角八分计算，总值十六元一角六分；一九五四年每亩平均收三百二十斤，总值八十九元六角，扣除人工和药费，每亩收益是八十五元二角九分，等于过去三年平均收入的五倍多。
