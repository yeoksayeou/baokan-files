　　New Towns and Villages on the Kangzang Highway
    Along the Kangzang Highway, many new towns and villages have appeared. In the past, there were very few villages on the desolate Kangzang Road from the Jinsha River to Lhasa, a distance of more than 1,000 kilometers. The section in the middle, which was almost uninhabited, was known as the "Poor Eight Stations." Since the opening of the highway, this situation has changed.

    In the once-isolated Bomi area, a new town, Zhamu, has emerged. Before the spring of 1954, it was still a barren dam overgrown with miscellaneous trees, inhabited by only six Tibetan families near the foot of the mountain. Now, Zhamu has a population of 8,000. New office buildings, auditoriums, hospitals, and residences have been built on the barren dam. The construction area has reached more than 6,000 square meters. The People's Bank of China, Xinhua Bookstore, Post and Telecommunications Bureau, state-owned trading departments, and transportation companies have all established branches here. The First Engineering Bureau of the Highway General Bureau and the Bomi Office of the Changdu Area People's Liberation Committee are also located here. In the past year, more than 120 new households have been added. There are more than 60 shops selling general merchandise, food, tailoring, etc., on Tent Street. In the evening, loudspeakers broadcast news and music from all parts of the motherland, and bright electric lights shine from the new houses. Every Saturday or holiday evening, the staff, soldiers, and local Tibetans living here watch movies together. This new town is still developing according to the construction blueprint, and new commercial districts, residential areas, people's squares, transportation stations, and auto repair shops will be built one after another. The People's Liberation Army engineering corps is building a bridge across the Palong Zangbu River, preparing to connect a grassland on the other side with the current urban area.

    Jiangda, more than 200 kilometers east of Changdu, used to be just a village with more than 20 small adobe houses. Now, its appearance has changed. The Jiangda maintenance section of the Kangzang Highway has built new red-roofed, white-walled houses. In front of the door of the Jiangda Zong trading group of the state-owned Changdu Trading Company, groups of customers often gather. Tibetan farmers and herdsmen bring cordyceps, musk, and other local products to trade. This spring, the trading group supplied a large number of daily necessities and some iron farm tools to the Tibetans. The Post and Telecommunications Bureau has connected Jiangda with the whole country, and people here can read the People's Daily and various publications published a few days ago. A larger-scale inn and dining station is also under construction.

    New settlements have begun to form near many road maintenance team houses and inn and dining stations along the highway. In Jintang, Youxi, and Bangda Grassland in the Nujiang Mountains, inn and dining stations have been built around the highway maintenance departments, and postal business offices have been established. Merchants have set up temporary sheds and tents here. A new bathroom has also been built on a hot spring in Youxi. New buildings have appeared on the shore of Lake Ancuo at the foot of the Bosula Ridge west of the Nujiang River, and some famine refugees from before liberation have also established new homes here.

### 康藏公路上的新村镇

　　康藏公路上的新村镇
    康藏公路沿线，出现了许多新的市镇和村落。过去，从金沙江到拉萨一千多公里的荒凉的康藏道上，村落很少。中间一段几无人烟的地区，被人称为“穷八站”。公路修通以后，这种情况已经改变。
    在过去交通闭塞的波密地区出现了一座新的市镇——扎木。一九五四年春天以前，这里还是一块杂树丛生的荒坝，只在靠山脚处住着六户藏民。现在扎木已有八千人口。荒坝上新建起办公楼、礼堂、医院和住宅。建筑面积已达六千多平方公尺。人民银行、新华书店、邮电局、国营贸易部门和运输公司等都在这里设立了分支机构，公路总局第一工程局、昌都地区人民解放委员会波密办事处也都设在这里。一年来这里新增加的居民有一百二十多户。帐篷街上有六十多家百货、食品、缝纫等商店。傍晚，扩音器播送着祖国各地的消息和音乐，新房屋里发出雪亮的电灯光。每逢星期六或节日晚上，住在这里的职工、战士和当地藏民一起看电影。这个新镇，还正按着建设蓝图在发展，新的商业区、居民住宅区、人民广场、运输站和汽车修理厂将接连不断地建筑起来。人民解放军工兵部队正在架设横跨泊龙藏布江上的大桥，准备把对岸一片草坝和现在的市区联接起来。
    昌都以东二百多公里的江达，以前只是一个有二十多间小土屋的村子。现在这里的面目已改观了。康藏公路江达养护段修起了红顶白墙的新房屋。国营昌都贸易公司江达宗贸易小组的门前，经常拥挤着成群的顾客。藏族农牧民带着虫草、麝香等土产品前来交易。今年春天，这个贸易小组就供应了藏民大批生活用品和部分铁质农具。邮电局把江达和全国联系起来，这里可以看到几天前出版的人民日报和各种刊物。一个规模较大的食宿站也正在修建。
    公路沿线许多道班房和食宿站的附近，开始形成新的居民点。在怒山山脉中的吉塘、酉西和邦达草原上，围绕着公路养护部门，修起了食宿站，设立了邮政营业处。商人在这里搭设了临时棚屋和帐篷。在酉西的一个温泉上还新盖了浴室。在怒江以西伯舒拉岭山下的安错湖边，出现了新的建筑物，有些解放前的逃荒户也在这里建立了新家园。
