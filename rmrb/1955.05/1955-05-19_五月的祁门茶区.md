　　May in the Qimen Tea Region
　　By Our Correspondent, Yu Ming
    The Qimen mountain region in southern Anhui is a well-known "Qihong" tea producing area at home and abroad. Here, mountains overlap, and lush and dense fir trees, pine trees, oil-tea trees, Chinese tallow trees, and tea trees cover ridge after ridge. The first half of May is the busiest time for farmers in the Qimen mountain area to pick spring tea. On many hillsides, red and green headscarves of tea-picking women flutter in the tea bushes, from which loud songs and cheerful conversations are heard; in many small mountain villages at the foot of the mountains, tea rolling machines are clattering, and men are busy making tea.
    During this year's tea picking season, the tea farmers are particularly happy. Further assistance from the state and the development of mutual aid and cooperation have enabled tea farmers to see the beautiful prospects of tea production collectivization and mechanization. The state has supplied even more tea rolling machines this year. Tea farmers in Qimen County already have five hundred tea rolling machines. The use of these machines greatly reduces the heavy labor and increases efficiency several times over. In order to help tea farmers improve tea making technology and improve tea quality, the state sent more than seventy workers from tea factories to only two districts to guide tea farmers in rolling and drying tea day and night, door to door. On the basis of the development of mutual aid and cooperation, tea farmers are not only able to use machines to roll tea, but also, in order to ensure quality, have changed the past practice of grabbing branches and leaves in a handful when picking tea. This year, most tea farmers have implemented the advanced Soviet experience: picking the large and leaving the small, picking in batches; the methods of applying fertilizer and weeding tea trees in spring have also gradually become popular. In previous years, each tea farmer had to pick tea, make tea, and sell tea by themselves, and could not rest day and night. This year, most tea farmers have divided their work in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and the phenomenon of making tea all night long has become rare.
    What makes the tea farmers most happy is that the purchase price of tea this year is more reasonable, truly achieving "good tea at a good price, inferior tea at an inferior price, pricing according to quality". The cumbersome procedures for evaluating tea and pricing have been simplified this year. Thirty purchasing stations have been set up throughout the county, and tea farmers can quickly sell their tea when they arrive at the station. After getting a reasonable price, the tea farmers walked back to their mountain villages with excitement, studying ways to further improve tea production and quality. They also expressed that they would work hard to pick "Qihong" summer tea. Some agricultural cooperatives are also preparing to try picking autumn tea in order to strive to complete this year's tea production increase task.

　　五月的祁门茶区
　　本报记者　于明
    安徽南部的祁门山区，是中外闻名的“祁红”茶产地。这里山峦重叠，葱笼茂密的杉树、松树、油茶树、乌桕树和茶树，覆盖了一座座山岭。五月的上半月，正是祁门山区农民最忙碌的采摘春茶的季节。许多山腰上，茶丛里飘动着采茶妇女们红红绿绿的头巾，从那里发出了响亮的歌声和欢快的谈笑声；山脚的许多小山庄里，揉茶机在轧轧响动，男人们正在紧张地制茶。
    今年的采茶季节里，茶农们特别欢快。国家进一步的帮助和互助合作的发展，使茶农们看到了茶叶生产合作化和机械化的美丽远景。国家今年供应的揉茶机更多了，祁门县茶农已经有了五百多架揉茶机，运用这些机械，就使得繁重的劳动大大减轻，效率提高数倍。国家为了帮助茶农改进制茶技术，提高茶叶质量，只在两个区就派去了七十多个制茶厂的工人，日日夜夜地，挨门挨户地指导茶农揉茶、烘茶。茶农们在互助合作发展的基础上，不但能够使用机器揉茶，而且为了保证质量，在采摘茶叶上，也改变了过去枝叶一把抓的现象。今年一般茶农都实行了苏联先进经验：采大留小，分批采摘；茶树春季施肥和锄茶的办法，也逐渐普遍起来了。往年每户茶农都要自己采茶、制茶、卖茶，白天黑夜都得不到休息，今年大多数茶农都在互助合作组织中分了工，通夜制茶的现象已经很少。
    最使茶农高兴的是，今年茶叶的收购价格更加合理，真正做到“好茶好价，次茶次价，按质论价”。评茶计价的繁琐手续今年简化了，全县设立了三十个收购站，茶农到站很快就能把茶售出。茶农们在得到合理价格后，都兴冲冲地走回自己的山庄，研究着进一步提高茶叶产量和质量的办法。并表示还要努力采摘“祁红”夏茶，有些农业合作社还准备试行采摘秋茶，为完成今年茶叶增产任务而奋斗。
