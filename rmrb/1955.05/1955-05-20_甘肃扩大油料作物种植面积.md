Gansu Expands Oil Crop Planting Area

Gansu Province plans to sow more than 3.59 million mu of oil crops this year, an increase of more than 20% compared to last year; the total output will be more than 230 million jin, an increase of 32% compared to last year. Currently, farmers in various regions are actively sowing. Many agricultural producers' cooperatives have taken a leading role in expanding the planting of oil crops. In Gulang County, four agricultural producers' cooperatives in Three Villages planted 137 mu last year, expanding to 410 mu this year; influenced by them, farmers in the whole village also increased from 480 mu last year to 960 mu this year, doubling the area. The increased planting of oil crops in various regions is being carried out under the principle of not affecting grain production. Of the more than 30,000 mu to be expanded in Dingxi County, 20,000 mu will be planted on fallow land; Weiyuan, Huichuan, Lintao and other counties, each expanding 10,000 mu to 20,000 mu, are also making full use of field ridges, threshing ground edges, intercropping, and reducing fallow land to solve the problem.

　  甘肃扩大油料作物种植面积
    甘肃省今年计划播种油料作物三百五十九万多亩，比去年扩大了百分之二十多；总产量为二亿三千多万斤，比去年增加百分之三十二。目前，各地农民正在积极播种。许多农业生产合作社在扩大播种油料作物中起了带头作用。古浪县三乡四个农业生产合作社，去年播种一百三十七亩，今年扩大到四百一十亩；全乡农民在它们影响下，也由去年的四百八十亩，扩大到今年的九百六十亩，增加了一倍。各地增播油料作物都是在不影响粮食生产的原则下进行的。定西县准备扩大的三万多亩中就有两万亩在轮歇地种植；渭源、会川、临洮等县各扩大一万亩到两万亩，也都充分利用地埂、场边、间种、减少轮歇地来解决。　（康）
