　　Ejin Banner's Supply and Marketing Cooperative
　　Yan Shugui
    The herdsmen of Ejin Banner in Gansu Province all talk about the supply and marketing cooperative with gratitude.
    Ejin Banner is a purely pastoral area, inhabited by more than two thousand Mongolian herdsmen. From Jiuquan to here, one needs to pass through four hundred *li* of the Gobi Desert. The land is vast and sparsely populated; it sometimes takes forty or fifty *li* to travel from one household to another. Before liberation, under the rule of the Kuomintang, traveling merchants only sold goods once a year, and the exchange prices were very unreasonable, leaving the masses living in extreme poverty. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, they were liberated politically and also freed from heavy economic exploitation. In 1952, the former Ningxia Provincial People's Government sent a work team to work here, and at the same time began to organize a supply and marketing cooperative. In 1953, the supply and marketing cooperative was officially established, setting up a store in Jianguoying and sending two mobile delivery teams to supply production and living materials to the more concentrated areas of herdsmen – Qingshantou and Donghe. With the increasing development of business, the scale of the supply and marketing cooperative has also expanded. The staff has grown from only five people to forty-four people now. The number of members has expanded even faster, with the number of herdsmen joining the cooperative accounting for 90% of the total number of herdsmen households. The supply and marketing cooperative has become the center of the economic life of the entire banner. Now, the Qingshantou delivery team has been expanded into a distribution store, and the Jianguoying store has developed into a store with a full range of goods. The seven rooms of the store display various commodities such as fabrics, food, general merchandise, and stationery. Production materials are placed in two other rooms, where herdsmen can buy high-quality saddles produced in Inner Mongolia, colorful horse tethers, and cashmere combs. Behind the store is the purchasing station for buying cattle and sheep hides, camel hair, and wool. In addition to supplying herdsmen with a large number of commodities in the store, the supply and marketing cooperative also sends mobile delivery teams deep into the *yurts*, delivering goods to very remote areas. The staff of the delivery teams often brave strong winds and heavy snow, traveling for several days in the vast Gobi Desert. Sometimes they don't encounter anyone and spend the night in the desolate desert. To meet the needs of the masses, they overcame all difficulties.
    In recent years, the supply and marketing cooperative has supplied herdsmen with a large amount of production and living materials at fair and reasonable prices, and purchased livestock products and other local specialties from herdsmen. Last year alone, the total supply and marketing volume reached more than 343,000 yuan, with an average transaction volume of more than 150 yuan per herdsman. Under the leadership of the Party, the supply and marketing cooperative has promoted the development of animal husbandry through its own economic activities. Many herdsmen have increased their livestock more than in the past, and their lives have improved compared to the past.

　　额济纳旗的供销合作社
　　燕树桂
    甘肃省额济纳旗的牧民们，一提到供销合作社，大家都用感激的心情谈论着它。
    额济纳旗是一个纯牧区，居住着两千多蒙族牧民。从酒泉到这里，需要通过四百华里的戈壁滩。地旷人稀，从这一户到另一户有时要走四五十里的路程。解放前，在国民党统治下，一年当中，边客（商人）只卖一次货，交换的价格很不合理，群众过着非常穷困的日子。解放后，在共产党的领导下，他们在政治上翻了身，同时也解除了经济上的重重剥削。一九五二年，前宁夏省人民政府派一个工作队来这里工作，同时着手组织供销合作社。一九五三年供销合作社正式成立，在建国营设立了一个门市部，并派出两个流动送货组到牧民较集中的地方——青山头和东河一带，供应生产和生活资料。随着业务的日益发展，供销合作社的规模也在扩大。工作人员原来只是五个人，现在有四十四人。社员扩大的更快，入社牧民占牧民户数百分之九十，供销合作社成了全旗人民经济生活的中心。现在，青山头送货组已扩充为一个分销店，建国营门市部发展成为一个货色俱全的商店。门市部的七间房里，分别摆着布匹、食品、百货、文具等方面各种商品。生产资料在另外两间房里放着，牧民可以在这里买到内蒙古出产的质量很好的一点元马鞍子，色彩鲜艳的马?，还可以买到抓羊绒的抓子。门市部的后面，是收购牛羊皮、驼毛、羊毛的收购处。供销合作社除了在门市部大量供应牧民商品以外，还派出流动送货组深入蒙古包，把货物送到很边远的地方。送货组的工作人员们，常常冒着大风大雪，在大戈壁滩上走好几天。有时遇不到人家，露宿在荒野的沙漠上。为了满足群众要求，他们克服了一切困难。
    几年来，供销合作社按照公平合理价钱供应了牧民大量生产资料和生活资料，收购了牧民的畜产品和其他土特产。光去年一年，供销总额就达到三十四万三千多元，平均每个牧民的交易总额是一百五十多元。供销合作社在党的领导下，通过自己的经济活动，促进了畜牧业的发展。许多牧民牲畜都比过去增多了，生活也比过去改善了。
