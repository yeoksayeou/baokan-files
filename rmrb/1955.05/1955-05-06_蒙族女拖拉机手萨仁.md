　　Sa Ren, a Mongolian female tractor driver from Inner Mongolia, has completed her studies at the Liang Jun Female Tractor Team in Northeast China and returned to her hometown. She is now driving a tractor, speeding across the fertile fields of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

　　In the summer of 1950, young Sa Ren was sent from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Heilongjiang Province to learn to drive a tractor. Sa Ren arrived at the Chahayang Farm, the New China's first female tractor team - the Liang Jun Female Tractor Team. For a Mongolian girl who had just left her hometown, learning to drive a tractor was very difficult. She even shed tears because she failed the first exam. But when she thought that she was sent by the people of Inner Mongolia to complete the task assigned by the people; and that she was a Communist Party member and must not bow her head in the face of difficulties, she mustered her courage and studied hard. At that time, Liang Jun and the Han comrades in the team often encouraged and helped her. Sa Ren often got up to study before others were awake, and gradually she learned to drive and repair, and learned about tractors and agricultural technology. Later, she became an excellent tractor driver in the Liang Jun Female Tractor Team. In 1953, Sa Ren was selected as a representative to attend the Second National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of China, and then participated in the Chinese Youth Delegation to attend the Third World Youth Congress and the Fourth World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship.

　　When she started learning, Sa Ren had a beautiful ideal: she wanted to be a very good tractor driver and, in the future, work with many comrades on the land of Inner Mongolia, engaging in modern, mechanized farming.

　　The motherland is advancing, and the various constructions in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are also developing rapidly. Huge state-owned farms have been established, and the first tractor station in the autonomous region has appeared on the banks of the Xiliao River, which is rich in grain. Sa Ren's wish has also come true.

　　Spring is here, and the tractor station has begun spring plowing and sowing for the nearby agricultural producers' cooperatives. Sa Ren and her locomotive team are working hard and happily in the fields, and she patiently helps some new female tractor drivers.

　　Recently, on the day I arrived at the tractor station, Sa Ren's team had overfulfilled their assigned work and saved a lot of fuel.

    内蒙古的蒙族女拖拉机手萨仁，已在东北梁军女拖拉机队学习完毕，回到自己的故乡。现在她正驾驶着拖拉机，驰骋在内蒙古自治区肥沃的原野上。
    一九五○年夏天，年轻的萨仁由内蒙古自治区被派到黑龙江省学开拖拉机，萨仁就到了查哈阳农场新中国第一个女拖拉机队——梁军女拖拉机队里。对于一个刚离开家乡的蒙族姑娘，学开拖拉机困难是很多的。她曾因第一次考试不及格而流过眼泪。但是当她想到自己是内蒙古人民派来的，要完成人民交给的任务；想到自己是一个共产党员，绝不能在困难面前低头的时候，她又鼓起勇气，努力学习。那时，梁军和队里的汉族同志们常常鼓励她、帮助她。萨仁常在人家还睡着的时候就起来学习，慢慢地她学会驾驶和检修，知道了拖拉机和农业技术上的知识。以后，她成为梁军女拖拉机队里的优秀拖拉机手。一九五三年，萨仁被选为出席中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会的代表，随着又参加了中国青年代表团，出席了第三届世界青年代表大会和第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节。
    学习当初，萨仁有一个美好的理想，她想做一个很好的拖拉机手，将来在内蒙古的土地上，和许多同志一道，进行现代化、机械化的耕作。
    祖国在前进，内蒙古自治区的各项建设也在飞跃发展着。巨大的国营农场建立起来了，在盛产粮食的西辽河畔，自治区的第一个拖拉机站出现了。萨仁的愿望也实现了。
    春天来了，拖拉机站开始为附近的农业生产合作社春耕播种。萨仁和她领导的一个机车小组，在田野里紧张和愉快地劳动着，她耐心地帮助一些新的女拖拉机手。
    最近，当我到达拖拉机站的那一天，萨仁的小组已超额完成了他们应担负的工作，并且节省了许多油料。
