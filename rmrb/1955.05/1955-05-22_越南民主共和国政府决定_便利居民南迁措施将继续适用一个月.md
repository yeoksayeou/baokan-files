Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 20th: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam decided on the 18th that measures to facilitate residents' relocation to the South will continue to apply for one month.

The decision states: Because the General Headquarters of the French Union Forces and the South Vietnamese authorities have still not responded to the February 4, 1955, proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the restoration of normal relations between the northern and southern regions of Vietnam—which proposed, among other things, allowing residents to travel freely—in order to enable those who wish to relocate but have delayed their departure due to transportation or other difficulties to settle in the South, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has decided that all measures taken to date to facilitate the relocation to the South of citizens of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam who wish to do so will continue to apply for one month.

This decision was forwarded to the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam on the 19th.

　　越南民主共和国政府决定
　　便利居民南迁措施将继续适用一个月
    新华社河内二十日电　越南民主共和国政府十八日决定，便利居民南迁的措施将继续适用一个月。
    决定说：由于法兰西联邦部队总司令部和南越当局仍然没有答复越南民主共和国政府一九五五年二月四日关于恢复越南南北两地区间的正常关系的建议——建议中提出除其他事项外允许居民自由往来，为了使愿意迁居但由于交通或其他困难而延迟行期的人能到南部定居，越南民主共和国政府决定，为便利愿意南迁的越南民主共和国公民南迁，迄今所采取的一切措施将继续适用一个月。
    这项决定已在十九日转给在越南的国际监督和监察委员会。
