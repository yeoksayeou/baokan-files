    My Self-Criticism
    Hu Feng
    Editor's Note: We are only now publishing Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism," which was written in January of this year, revised in February, and added with a "Postscript" in March, along with Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique," for the following reason: to prevent Hu Feng from continuing to deceive readers by using our newspaper. From the materials revealed in Shu Wu's article, readers can see how early Hu Feng and the anti-Party and anti-people literary group he led became hostile, hateful, and resentful towards the Chinese Communist Party and non-Party progressive writers. From those letters Hu Feng wrote to Shu Wu, can readers detect even a trace of revolutionary spirit? Isn't the atmosphere emanating from these letters exactly the same as what we once smelled in publications like "Social News" and "News World" published by Kuomintang secret service agencies? What "petty-bourgeois revolutionary spirit and standpoint," what "realistic literature with various tendencies of resisting feudal traditions from the perspective of democratic demands," what "standpoint of sharing the destiny with the people," what "revolutionary humanitarian spirit," what "revolutionary ideas of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal people's liberation," what "conforming to the Party's political program," what "if not for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I personally would not have found a place to settle down in the past twenty years," can such words be believed? If not wearing a false signboard, would an intellectual who truly has "petty-bourgeois revolutionary spirit and standpoint" (and there are hundreds of thousands of such people in China, who cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party and are willing to be led by the Party) adopt such a hostile, hateful, and resentful attitude towards the Party and progressive writers? The false is false, and the disguise should be stripped away. Among the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, there may still be people like Shu Wu who were deceived but are unwilling to follow Hu Feng forever; they should provide more materials to the Party to expose Hu Feng. Concealment cannot last long; it will eventually be exposed. The tactic of shifting from offense to retreat (i.e., self-criticism) cannot deceive people either. Self-criticism should be like Shu Wu's; false self-criticism is not acceptable. Lu Ling should have received more secret letters from Hu Feng; we hope he will hand them over. Everyone who was mixed up with Hu Feng and obtained secret letters should also hand them over; handing them over is better than preserving or destroying them. Hu Feng should do the work of stripping away the mask, rather than making deceptive self-criticism. Stripping away the mask, revealing the truth, and helping the Party thoroughly understand the entire situation of Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique, and from then on becoming a true person, is the only way out for Hu Feng and every member of the Hu Feng faction.

    In this movement to criticize bourgeois ideology, I have begun to realize my serious errors. The root cause of my errors is that I regarded the petty-bourgeois revolutionary spirit and standpoint as the revolutionary spirit and standpoint of the working class, and confused the principled differences between them. This error is theoretically manifested in being limited to a narrow practical viewpoint and failing to see problems from political principles, distorting and even obliterating the standpoint of the working class, violating Marxism on several fundamental issues, and violating Chairman Mao's literary and artistic guidelines. In terms of style and attitude, it is manifested in long-term rejection of ideological reform, self-righteous personal heroism, narrow sectarian sentiments, a serious lack of self-criticism, and detachment from the masses, and underestimation of the collective. For a long time, I persisted in errors with a self-righteous attitude, neglected the criticisms and expectations of comrades, so that these errors were not only not corrected, but continued to develop malignantly.

    In "On the Issue of National Form" written in 1940, I made erroneous arguments about the guiding ideology of the May Fourth New Literature Movement:
    "The May Fourth literary revolution movement of the Chinese people, with the urban population as its alliance leader, is precisely a newly expanded tributary of the world's progressive literary tradition that has accumulated for hundreds of years since the rise of the urban society." At that time, I did not recognize that "the May Fourth Movement was a part of the proletarian world revolution at that time," but mistakenly believed that a revolutionary literary movement led by the proletarian worldview was fully established only after 1927. This completely violated Chairman Mao's analysis and conclusion on the May Fourth New Culture Movement: "After the 'May Fourth,' China produced a completely new force in culture, which is the communist cultural thought led by the Chinese Communists, that is, the communist worldview and social revolution theory."
    Although I also stated at the time: "That is not a general 'Western European literature,' but: realistic (and romantic) literature with various tendencies of resisting feudal traditions from the perspective of democratic demands; the literature of weak nations striving for independence and liberation from the perspective of national liberation; the newly emerging literature that wants to break free from the fate of wage slaves from the perspective of affirming the working people." But this explanation was limited to "affirming the viewpoint of the working people." Linking this explanation with the erroneous argument confused the specific content of the proletarian leadership thought and the practice being led at that time, and in effect, obliterated the difference between bourgeois thought and proletarian thought.

    Although it was not possible to study Chairman Mao's works under the rule of the Kuomintang in 1940, the serious thing is that this error has not been examined and corrected ever since. What is more serious is that I checked out this error in 1952, but I still could not recognize the nature of this error and other errors. At that time, until not long before that, I thought this erroneous argument was only an individual one, and that if my other arguments had errors, they were also only individual ones. But the situation was exactly the opposite.

    In fact, this is not simply an individual error in judging the leadership thought of the May Fourth Movement at that time. In my writings, this error has been appearing in different forms ever since.
    This is the question of understanding the nature of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal political program of the Chinese revolution. The anti-imperialist and anti-feudal political program is the specific program of the Chinese working class in the democratic revolution stage, but it is only the minimum program of the working class. I recognized this in theory, but I fell into error when understanding the broad foundation of literary and artistic practice under the political program. Because I only proposed requirements and distinguished the content and development level of various practices from the broad realistic foundation of literary and artistic practice, and tried to pursue advanced things in it, but could not grasp the content of practice from the highest principle guiding this program, I confused things that met the requirements of this program with the standpoint of the working class, confused the content of "the people" with the content of "the working class," and confused the leading with the led. As a result, I inevitably confused the standpoint of the working class with the standpoint of the petty bourgeoisie. This serious error is essentially a reflection of bourgeois thought. This is an error that comes from the lack of a spirit of pursuit for the Party's ideological principles, an error that comes from only looking at problems from a local practical viewpoint and not from politics, but fundamentally, it is an error that comes from my own petty-bourgeois standpoint. This is fundamentally against Marxism. Because of this error, I produced serious biases, merely emphasizing the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal ideological requirements under the leadership of the Communist Party, while neglecting the standpoint of the working class; merely emphasizing that under the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal ideological requirements, one can enter practice everywhere and solve problems through the process of practice, but falling into a narrow practical viewpoint, belittling the guiding role of revolutionary theory for literary and artistic practice; merely emphasizing practical attitude but blurring class viewpoint, and evading the issue of standpoint transformation; sometimes manifested as "left" dogmatism, but in essence, it is right-leaning thought. For many years, I only focused on exploring the practice of literary and artistic creation, therefore, in the relationship between writers and politics, my understanding only stopped at the point that writers should engage in practice under the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, but could not make further pursuit of the political principles that guide this struggle. The fundamental problem lies here. Because I have not regarded this as a fundamental problem for a long time, I have committed serious errors that deviate from or even run counter to the standpoint of the working class on specific issues related to literary and artistic practice.

    My understanding of realism came from Stalin's saying:
    Write the truth! Let the writer study in life! If he can reflect the truth of life in a highly artistic form, he will surely reach Marxism.
    In the more than ten years before liberation, I engaged in writing under the conditions at the time, trying to explore the relationship between writers and life and the practical process of realism, requiring writers to reflect the "truth of life" and serve the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle under the vision of people's liberation and human liberation. I believe that a writer's ideological understanding must become his own flesh and blood requirements, otherwise, the consequence of replacing the real with concepts will occur in creative practice. However, for many years, I have been limited to such a practical viewpoint, resulting in a bias of belittling the guiding role of theory; belittling the guiding role of theory, the "ideological understanding of the writer" and "the vision of people's liberation and human liberation," etc., that I require must be vague. Therefore, the requirement that writers should write the truth of going to the future cannot be guaranteed under the most favorable conditions.

    Stalin's saying should be understood as follows: As a prerequisite requirement, socialist writers should master Marxism, but should not demand it arbitrarily and rudely like the "Lappists", but should help them solve it from practice. At the same time, for writers, if he is still far from mastering Marxism for a while, but through the creative path of learning from life and "writing the truth," and recognizing the truth in practice, he will also reach Marxism.

    At the same time, when understanding the practical viewpoint emphasized by Stalin's saying, it should be linked with Stalin's other principle, that is, "practice without theory is blind practice." That is to say, through the practice of life and creation, writers certainly have the possibility of writing the truth, recognizing the truth, and reaching Marxism in this sense, but Marxism has an important guiding role for literary and artistic practice. As Chairman Mao pointed out in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "It is necessary to have the knowledge of Marxism-Leninism," "It is right for literary and art workers to study literary and art creation, but Marxism-Leninism is a science that all revolutionaries should study, and literary and art workers are no exception." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong", Volume III, page 854)
    However, I used to have a one-sided and simple understanding of Stalin's saying. Although I also mentioned the guiding role of theory, I often abandoned this point and emphasized "learning in life" and reaching the truth in creative practice. As a result of one-sided emphasis, I separated the saying "writing the truth" from the principle of "practice without theory is blind practice," and committed the error of neglecting and even belittling the guiding role of Marxism for creative practice. My attitude towards Marxism and practice is against Marxism.

    When I was young, I felt the harm of vulgar mechanism acutely. Under the influence of the liquidation of the "Lapp" in the Soviet Union, I opposed the simple understanding of literary creation, but because I failed to transform myself well, I was further limited by a narrow practical viewpoint, which fueled this error of belittling the guiding role of theory, and took a serious attitude of contempt for general theoretical propaganda work.

    In my understanding of realistic creative practice, the second key point is that writers must have a standpoint of sharing the destiny with the people, an attitude of love and hate towards enemies, friends, and ourselves in the real struggle, and a spirit of revolutionary humanism. I believe that this spirit should and can be generated from the revolutionary ideological demands of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal people's liberation, which I call "subjective spirit" or "subjective fighting spirit." On this point, my error is that when emphasizing this spirit as a practical attitude, I blurred a fundamental issue, that is, the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal demands of writers at that time carried various non-proletarian things. Generally speaking, writers can gradually overcome their mistakes and transform themselves by relying on a certain positive practical attitude in the process of practice, but at the same time, it must be pointed out that this practical attitude and practical requirements need to strive for the guarantee of a correct standpoint. Regarding the "attitude issue," Chairman Mao said: "Along with the standpoint, there arises our specific attitude towards various specific things." I only required the establishment of a practical attitude, overcoming mistakes and gradually transforming oneself in practice, but did not recognize at the same time that the transformation of standpoint has the nature of determining the attitude and plays a guaranteeing role for practice, so it is bound to produce the error of blurring and even obliterating the class viewpoint. Writers in the Kuomintang-ruled areas at that time generally did not establish the working-class standpoint, but had anti-imperialist and anti-feudal ideological demands of various natures, most of which were anti-imperialist and anti-feudal demands from the petty-bourgeois standpoint. Although that could meet the Party's political program at that time to a certain extent, it was also vacillating and incomplete. I emphasized the aspect that their demands conformed to the Party's political program, and proposed the importance of practical attitude ("subjective fighting spirit"), but because I confused things that met the requirements of the Party's political program with the standpoint of the working class, I blurred and even obliterated the fact that for the practical attitude and practical requirements containing various natures of the petty bourgeoisie, the issue of transforming the standpoint must be raised in principle at the same time. This is contrary to Chairman Mao's instructions on ideological reform. On the surface, I thought it was impossible to raise and solve this problem in that kind of environment, but in reality, it was because I did not recognize the principled significance of this problem that must be implemented in specific practice. In addition, in my articles, the meaning of the term "subjective spirit" is often different, mainly referring to the practical attitude mentioned above, but sometimes it refers to the subjective role of writers reflecting reality, sometimes it refers to the worldview, and sometimes it refers to the patriotic romantic enthusiasm. This reflects the confusion in my thinking. Moreover, some sayings, such as "benevolent mind," etc., are detached from class content and become idealistic abstract things. I one-sidedly emphasized practical attitude, obliterated class viewpoint, and even fell into idealistic errors.

    Because I mostly looked at problems from the scope of creative practice process and creative methods, I also did not clearly understand the difference between past realism and socialist realism. Past realism and socialist realism certainly both reflect reality, but the class difference of writers and the reflection of this difference (worldview, standpoint) in works cannot be ignored, and what produced socialist realism is the reality of the proletarian revolutionary era, and the party spirit standpoint of writers is different from all past eras, which produces its powerful strength in method. Although I pointed out the limitations of the class standpoint suffered by past realists, I mostly combined with my own practical requirements at the time, praised that attitude and creative method of being loyal to reality as our reference, and did not make a clear comparison and distinction between the arrival point of their realism and the requirements of socialist realism.

    Although I also generally mentioned the tradition of socialist realism (the path of Gorky and Lu Xun) and the content of practice (representing "advanced people," etc.), and knew that its difference from past realism lies in describing reality "from the revolutionary development of reality" and "educating and transforming the working people ideologically with the socialist spirit," my understanding of these two tasks was not clear. Until after liberation, I still only emphasized that writers can absorb the socialist spirit by starting from the creative practice of supporting the Party's political program, describe reality "in the revolutionary development," and can "reach" Marxism in the sense of writing the truth, and seriously underestimated that writers can deeply and fully reach describing reality "in the revolutionary development" only under the guidance of Marxism, and fully stand on the standpoint of party spirit and have the socialist spirit. In my writings, the role of realistic creative methods has always been emphasized while the role of the worldview has been neglected.

    At that time, the understanding of Marxism of writers in the Kuomintang-ruled areas was generally not clear, and some had no understanding at all. Starting from practice, in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle led by the Party, they were able to reflect the realistic struggle at that time to a certain extent, and it was also possible to strive to overcome the errors in their thinking from the attitude and creative methods of being loyal to reality under the influence of revolutionary ideas, and reach socialist realism in the process of learning from life and "writing the truth." As analyzed above, my error still lies in that I only emphasized the role of realistic creative methods, and seriously neglected the dialectical relationship between starting from practice and striving for Marxist guidance. In the reality at that time, it was certainly possible to strive for the achievement of realism by starting from practice, but at the same time, if writers could not accept Marxist guidance to a certain extent, relying only on the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal ideological understanding, the process of creative practice (understanding reality) would be more difficult, and the wrong thoughts and feelings of writers subjectively would be more difficult to overcome. As for the reality today, Marxism plays a fundamental role in leading national construction, therefore, merely emphasizing learning from life and creative practice to solve problems, and belittling the important role of Marxism in guiding writers, will make it impossible for writers to clearly recognize the transformation and development of real life, and there is a danger of getting lost.

    The biases and errors of my other arguments are similar when analyzed.

    Regarding the issue of "discovering and reflecting spontaneity" and the argument that "where there is life, there is struggle." In the Kuomintang-ruled areas at that time, reflecting the spontaneous resistance demands of the working people in literary and artistic works should have practical significance, and ideologically and politically, it served the general demand of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. Writers who were under dark rule at that time, under their practical conditions, have already had to pay considerable efforts to describe this with a certain degree of authenticity, and need a certain revolutionary standpoint. My error lies in that when affirming these efforts, I did not emphatically point out the limitations of these works, and, although I repeatedly talked about writers exercising in life, because I confused the general anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle demands with the working-class standpoint, I actually obliterated the issue of transforming the standpoint. And when I later debated with comrades in Hong Kong, I instead said that the limitations of these works seemed absolutely insurmountable, and therefore, in reality, I did not think they had limitations. The direction of efforts of petty-bourgeois writers who tend to revolution lies in constantly overcoming their limitations, transforming the standpoint, striving to write the truth historically and concretely in the development of the revolution, and educating the people ideologically with the socialist spirit. The general writers in the Kuomintang-ruled areas at that time were certainly restricted by objective conditions and subjective conditions, and it was difficult to do this. However, due to my erroneous standpoint and with serious erroneous emotions, when I debated the issue, although in recognition I generally touched upon the various thematic contents of writers writing the truth in the development of the revolution, and thought that depicting the positive characters and victories of the revolutionary struggle was a primary task, in emotions, I used the limitations at that time to defend myself, and avoided the issue of transforming the standpoint. Therefore, in the requirements for literary and artistic creation, I focused more on the general content of realism, and did not highlight the primary content of depicting the positive characters and victories in the revolutionary struggle to educate the people with the socialist spirit. This attitude and viewpoint of mine brought harmful effects to the goal of ideological transformation and the in-depth, organized, and led mass struggle proposed by the revolutionary realistic struggle to progressive writers at that time. This seriously contradicts Chairman Mao's literary and artistic guidelines.

    "Where there is life, there is struggle" is, similarly, a one-sided, politically detached view from a narrow practical perspective at that time. The argument itself, generally speaking, is not wrong. However, at that time, the revolutionary struggle was developing, and my statement directly violated the Party's political demand at that time to call on progressive youths to enter the liberated areas and engage in the actual struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers to obtain ideological transformation, and prepare forces for further revolutionary needs. Moreover, from the perspective of literary and artistic practice itself, if this argument is not proposed under the premise of transforming the standpoint, it will also lead to a non-political tendency towards life and struggle, blurring the leading role of politics for literature and art. What is more serious is that when I debated with comrades in Hong Kong, in order to defend my point of view, with serious confrontational emotions, I even described the Kuomintang-ruled areas as "this shore" and ridiculed the Party's political demands represented by the comrades in Hong Kong as "the other shore," producing extremely harmful political effects. Comrades blamed me, saying that some young people refused to go to actual struggle under the protection of my views, and I have a serious responsibility for this. In my writings, I also mentioned going to actual struggle, but due to my erroneous standpoint, the content was unclear, and the long-term heavy reactionary rule prevented my feelings from developing into something more positive than resisting the oppression of the specific environment. This kind of ideological emotion appeared in the guise of loyalty to the practice of this time and this place, so that I could not recognize myself for a long time, violated Chairman Mao's literary and artistic guidelines for a long time, but instead used Chairman Mao's instruction of "the difference between environment and task" to defend myself, which fully exposed my standpoint error.

    Regarding the issue of selecting themes for literary creation, my error is also similar. In order to enable writers to enter practice under the conditions that could be had at that time, in order to explain the significance of social struggles and the resistance demands of the working people around the lives of writers at that time, I believe that for realistic writers with revolutionary demands, from any aspect of the broad objective foundation (themes) of the democratic struggle at that time, corresponding themes and images with social typical significance that lead to the whole of the struggle can be taken out. On this issue, my error is precisely related to the error on the issue of reflecting the spontaneous resistance demands. The issue is not about affirming the broadness of the practical foundation of writers, the issue is not about that themes can be selected from any aspect of social life and struggle, the issue is still that when explaining the significance of social struggles and the general resistance demands of the working people at that time, I had emotions of settling for the status quo, avoided the issue of going deep into the actual struggle of the revolutionary masses, and did not highlight the primary content of depicting positive characters and victories to educate the working people with the socialist spirit. Although I have been saying to go deep into life, I have not recognized the decisive significance of going deep into the actual struggle of the revolutionary masses, but instead used the general life struggle to replace the actual struggle of the revolutionary masses, and therefore violated Chairman Mao's principled instruction on going deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    On the issue of the national literary heritage, I also committed errors that, although expressed differently, are essentially the same. When emphasizing the fighting tradition of revolutionary literature and art since the May Fourth Movement, I treated the national literary heritage wrongly. In the Kuomintang-ruled areas at that time, generally speaking, the reactionaries were using the dross in the national literary heritage as weapons to attack the people, so the emotion of resisting this situation is understandable. However, in the argument of "On the Issue of National Form," I treated the democratic and realistic content in the national literary heritage wrongly from the perspective of dogmatism. Although I also affirmed at that time that there are democratic components in the national literary heritage, I looked at the problem from the point that they have not been able to "develop into a mass, scientific, and practical ideological system or attitude to life that recognizes and transforms reality," and seriously belittled the value of the national literary heritage, demanding it from the abstract principle instead of the viewpoint of the people's character of the historical content of the works, which is dogmatism itself. This kind of dogmatism appeared with "left" emotions. Moreover, due to my erroneous standpoint, it was inflated by this "left" emotion, and I adopted a self-righteous individualistic attitude towards some comrades, which objectively caused damage to the literary and artistic movement led by the Party. In addition to the error in the theory itself, this politically charged error is even more unforgivable.

    In my writings, in addition to many terms not being scientific, I also borrowed some concepts and words from bourgeois enlightenment culture, such as "personality strength," "subjective spirit," and so on. I used these concepts and words because I felt that they had played a positive role in the bourgeois anti-feudal revolution and could resist the oppressive depression and the atmosphere of vanity and decadence at that time, but these originally idealistic concepts and words, in most cases, were not occupied by the practical content and ideological requirements I put forward and the meanings attached to them in the full text, but instead made me become their prisoners. This also reflects that my thinking is inextricably linked with bourgeois thought.

    Due to the non-political and blind rebellious emotions against the then reactionary heavy oppression that came from my erroneous standpoint, individualism was also essentially used as a weapon in many viewpoints, which seemed to resist the darkness, but at the same time resisted collectivism. Due to this kind of thinking and other circumstances, I published articles such as "On the Subjective," which essentially promoted idealism and individualism, in the publications I edited in my later period, causing harmful effects among readers. For this, I have long only regarded it as a publishing responsibility, and could not recognize that this was a politically serious error that came from a standpoint error and violated the Party's ideological principles.

    Looking back on my literary work in the past twenty years, due to my long-term detachment from leadership in specific work, not leaning towards leadership, I have not been able to be transformed, resulting in a series of errors. A more serious problem is that I have not been able to recognize errors for a long time, and have persisted in errors since liberation, so that my erroneous tendencies have had malignant development. Not correcting errors, being self-righteous, despising the collective, and looking at the new reality with a local practical viewpoint and past narrow experience will inevitably sink deeper and deeper. Due to this ideological movement, due to the criticisms of comrades, I have gradually begun to realize my problems.

    Where do the roots of these errors lie? What kind of nature are they?

    As said earlier, all of this is of course because my petty-bourgeois standpoint has not been transformed, and I regard my revolutionary spirit and standpoint of following the revolutionary cause as the revolutionary spirit and standpoint of the working class, blurring the difference between them, which is the class root of the errors that I have simply analyzed earlier.

    In the five years since liberation, I have not faced up to and discovered my errors, let alone made efforts to recognize errors from political principles, so this error has developed malignantly.

    "The revolutionary spirit of any petty-bourgeois element who has not been proletarianized is essentially different from the proletarian revolutionary spirit, and this difference often develops into a state of confrontation." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume III, page 993)

    The problem can also be further advanced in specific content.

    From my situation, for many years, I have been looking at problems with some experience in creative practice obtained from classical writers and Soviet writers, and some practical experience I have accumulated in literary work, and I am also limited by local practice, so I often "exaggerate one-sided and relative truths into universal and absolute truths; their thoughts do not conform to the objective and comprehensive actual situation" (ibid., page 990). This is because: "Although petty-bourgeois elements connected to production have a certain perceptual knowledge, they are limited by the narrowness, looseness, isolation, and conservatism of small-scale production, and their way of thinking is more likely to be expressed as the empiricism we mentioned earlier." (ibid., page 994) This is the ideological root of the errors that I have simply analyzed earlier.

    Therefore, my error has also developed in a more serious direction. That is, for a long time, due to being detached from the collective, individual struggle, sectarian emotions have grown, and I have been unwilling to lean towards the criticisms of comrades and develop self-criticism. This has developed into a serious situation of disregarding political influence and ignoring the overall situation in some debates before liberation, as shown in "On the Road of Realism."

    In "On the Road of Realism" (1948), in order to defend my understanding of literature and art, encouraged by strong sectarian emotions, I promoted my narrow practical requirements and understanding of literary and artistic creation to general major problems, using this to look at, or rather "set on," objective reality, self-righteously explaining the Party's ideological principles and political requirements, which today seems to be, in reality, distorting, that is, opposing, the Party's ideological principles and political requirements with my petty-bourgeois standpoint. On these issues, the subjective one-sidedness of my way of thinking and its dangerous tendencies, which cannot be clearly seen in the arguments mainly based on parallel narratives above, are clearly exposed.

    Because of emphasizing writers' life practice and creative practice on the issue of literary and artistic creation, emphasizing reaching the truth through practice, I subjectively and one-sidedly emphasized that "theory or principles should be elevated from 'specific history or reality'," and emphasized that "theory or principles can only be measured from historical requirements or practical nature." But the "historical requirements" I said, although rationally refers to the direction of the struggle led by the working class towards the future, in actual feeling, it has not been able to obtain more advanced ideological content than the general anti-imperialist and anti-feudal requirements that my petty-bourgeois standpoint can feel, and the "practical nature" I said refers to the narrow practical paths of intellectuals and writers, such as "seeking effective practical ways to open up the people's road in their own situation." Then, the inevitable logical result is that what cannot be felt "in their own situation" is "ineffective" for themselves, and therefore it is an empty "general principle."

    Needless to say, the writer's thoughts should flow like blood in the movement process of the images in the work. This is to be realized in the creative process. But I promoted this understanding to general problems, saying: "Thought (consciousness) cannot be 'thought' on the plane of logical formula, it must become 'existence of consciousness', that is, a subjective requirement that comes from realistic requirements." In terms of the thinking of images in the creative process, and in terms of the creative achievements of writers, thoughts certainly cannot be on the plane of logical formula, but I promoted this point, lost the huge guiding role of ideological principles for writers in the process of life practice and research, which gradually became the internal requirements of writers in the creative process, and even transformed the writers' incorrect internal requirements. And further said this on general issues other than the creative process: "Practical and true thought ("reason") can never not be the content of 'sensory activity', it cannot not become a passionate practical attitude, so the hatred expressed by the spokesperson of the oppressed is 'the mother of all wisdom'." This statement essentially changes the Marxist thought that guides practice into the content of spontaneous "sensory activity," "practical attitude," "hatred," that is, what I call "subjective fighting spirit." This will essentially reach the cancellation of Marxism as objective truth, and will reach the cancellation of the law of development of objective reality that has not been contacted by sensation but is reflected by revolutionary theory. The one-sided subjective ideological method produced from the narrow requirements of creative practice has thus tortuously led to subjective idealism.

    This is also expressed in other arguments and issues.

    In order to defend narrow practical requirements, I emphasized the writer's "subjective fighting spirit," "sincere ideological requirements," and so on. Leaving aside the premise requirements of the standpoint issue, this "sincerity" should be difficult to say. Everyone can think that they are sincere, and use this as a weapon to prove that others are insincere. This loses the objective standard and leads to the result of subjective arbitrariness. In fact, this is exactly the case. Myself and the people under my influence, inflated by sectarian emotions, felt that we were sincere, and subjectively attacked some writers in the revolutionary camp as insincere. Therefore, my sincerity fell to a subjective standard, that is, the complete affirmation of the sincerity of feelings that are essentially petty-bourgeois, using the concrete practice "in one's own situation" as a weapon.

    From this further, I distorted ideological revolution, that is, the rectification movement in the base areas. I did not understand that the Party's rectification movement mainly opposed the reflection of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts in the revolutionary ranks, but thought that the anti-dogmatism proposed in the rectification movement was in line with my own anti-subjective formulism, which vulgarized the great revolutionary task of anti-dogmatism. I used my petty-bourgeois standpoint and narrow practical requirements that the rectification movement opposed to distort anti-dogmatism. Therefore, I only stayed at the general statement of "ideological requirements of the new democracy," saying that the "central point" of the significance of the rectification movement for writers in the Kuomintang-ruled areas is to strive for the strengthening of subjective ideological standpoint or ideological requirements," and this so-called "strengthening" directly and fundamentally distorted the principled significance of transforming the standpoint "from one class to another." Moreover, not explaining that intellectuals need to be transformed from the ideological essence, but only from the "superiority," "fantasy," and "frivolous mental state" of intellectuals is also from this subjective distortion of ideological transformation. This also certainly cannot truly understand the issue of the combination of writers and the people. Since the May Fourth Movement, writers of petty-bourgeois origin who tend to revolution have had a certain degree of connection and even blood relationship with the people under the influence of Marxism and revolutionary struggles; I affirmed this in order to encourage practical efforts, but regarded this certain degree of sympathy and feeling for the people as the combination with the people. Not treating the existing distance with the people as a serious problem, but not treating the true combination with the people that does not exist as a difficult direction of struggle. This is the result of my practical feelings, my "own situation," my contempt for principles. On the one hand, it is my standpoint issue, and on the other hand, it is the result of the subjective ideological method produced from my standpoint.

    Looking at the objective revolutionary reality from narrow practical requirements is bound to make more serious errors. I used this kind of statement to describe the task of the literary and artistic struggle in the Kuomintang-ruled areas at that time: "Illuminated by the ideological requirements of the New Democracy, attracted by the heroic achievements of the advanced people, the central goal of the literary and artistic struggle on this gray battlefield is to embody the people's burden, awakening, potential, wish, and the burning and strong subjective ideological requirements of seizing the road to survival, which is also to reflect the people's burden, awakening, potential, wish, and the rich objective historical content of seizing the road to survival." Saying that this is "historical reality that is everywhere." The second kind of truth required here, that is, the truth leading to the future, although rationally refers to the reality in the revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Party, in the actual feeling, it blurred the dominant content in the struggle in the Kuomintang-ruled areas at that time, that is, the leading role and leading force of the working-class vanguard. Therefore, the historical reality such as the people's awakening and seizing the road to survival described here can only refer to spontaneous resistance demands, and the "ideological requirements of the New Democracy" said here, although rationally refers to the direction of the struggle led by the working class towards the future, in the actual feeling, it cannot obtain more advanced ideological content than the general anti-imperialist and anti-feudal requirements that my standpoint and "situation" can feel. This exaggerates spontaneity, and its logical inevitable result is to exclude leadership.

    Since I cannot stand at the height of the revolutionary reality that I cannot feel "in my own situation" to look at the problem, starting from "my own situation," I often concentrate my feelings on the dark rule of the old society, feeling particularly clearly, exaggerating the "mud" I am in into a huge reality that blocks everything, and exaggerating the "spiritual slavery wound" in the feeling of the people. Moreover, further, in the description of the people's power, the aspect of the people as the great creator of history is taken lightly, but the aspect of the people as the victims of class oppression is taken seriously; in the description of the damage given to the revolution by hostile thoughts, I directly replaced the objective reality with my own subjective feelings, and attributed the deviations and errors within the revolution, that is, the reflection and harm of the thoughts of hostile classes within the revolution, to the "spiritual slavery wound" of the people, saying that it is "a

    我的自我批判
　　胡风
    编者按：胡风的这篇在今年一月写好、二月作了修改、三月又写了“附记”的“我的自我批判”，我们到现在才把它和舒芜的那篇“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”一同发表，是有这样一个理由的，就是不让胡风利用我们的报纸继续欺骗读者。从舒芜文章所揭露的材料，读者可以看出，胡风和他所领导的反党反人民的文艺集团是怎样老早就敌对、仇视和痛恨中国共产党和非党的进步作家。读者从胡风写给舒芜的那些信上，难道可以嗅得出一丝一毫的革命气味来吗？从这些信上发散出来的气味，难道不是同我们曾经从国民党特务机关出版的“社会新闻”、“新闻天地”一类刊物上嗅到过的一模一样吗？什么“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”，什么“在民主要求的观点上，和封建传统反抗的各种倾向的现实主义文艺”，什么“和人民共命运的立场”，什么“革命的人道主义精神”，什么“反帝反封建的人民解放的革命思想”，什么“符合党的政治纲领”，什么“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的”，这种种话，能够使人相信吗？如果不是打着假招牌，是一个真正有“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”的知识分子（这种人在中国成千成万，他们是和中国共产党合作并愿意受党领导的），会对党和进步作家采取那样敌对、仇视和痛恨的态度吗？假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。胡风反党集团中像舒芜那样被欺骗而不愿永远跟着胡风跑的人，可能还有，他们应当向党提供更多的揭露胡风的材料。隐瞒是不能持久的，总有一天会暴露出来。从进攻转变为退却（即检讨）的策略，也是骗不过人的。检讨要像舒芜那样的检讨，假检讨是不行的。路翎应当得到胡风更多的密信，我们希望他交出来。一切和胡风混在一起而得有密信的人也应当交出来，交出比保存或销毁更好些。胡风应当做剥去假面的工作，而不是骗人的检讨。剥去假面，揭露真相，帮助党彻底弄清胡风及其反党集团的全部情况，从此做个真正的人，是胡风及胡风派每一个人的唯一出路。
    在这次批判资产阶级思想运动中，我开始认识到我的严重错误。我的错误底根源是，把小资产阶级的革命性和立场当作了工人阶级的革命性和立场，混淆了它们中间的原则的区别。这种错误在理论上表现为，局限于狭隘的实践观点而不能从政治原则看问题，歪曲以至抹煞工人阶级立场，在几个根本问题上违背了马克思主义，违背了毛主席底文艺方针。在作风和态度上表现为长期地拒绝思想改造，自以为是的个人英雄主义，狭隘的宗派情绪，严重地缺乏自我批评精神，以及脱离群众，轻视集体。长期以来，我以自以为是的态度坚持错误，忽视了同志们底批评和期待，以至这些错误不但得不到改正，反而继续有了恶性的发展。
    在一九四○年写的“论民族形式问题”里面，我对五四新文学运动的领导思想作了错误的论断：
  “以市民为盟主的中国人民大众底五·四文学革命运动，正是市民社会突起了以后的、累积了几百年的、世界进步文学传统底一个新拓的支流。”我当时没有认识到“五四运动是当时无产阶级世界革命的一部分”，而错误地以为，一直到一九二七年以后，才全面地建立了以无产阶级底世界观为领导的革命文学运动。这完全违反了毛主席关于五四新文化运动的分析和结论：“在‘五四’以后，中国产生了完全崭新的文化生力军，这就是中国共产党人所领导的共产主义的文化思想，即共产主义的宇宙观和社会革命论。”
    虽然我当时也说明了：“那不是笼统的‘西欧文艺’，而是：在民主要求底观点上，和封建传统反抗的各种倾向的现实主义（以及浪漫主义）文艺；在民族解放底观点上，争求独立解放的弱小民族文艺；在肯定劳动人民底观点上，想挣脱工钱奴隶底命运的、自然生长的新兴文艺。”但这种说明，也仅仅止于“肯定劳动人民的观点”。把这种说明和错误论断联系起来，就混淆了当时无产阶级领导思想和被领导的实践的具体内容，实际上也就抹煞了资产阶级思想和无产阶级思想的区别。
      虽然一九四○年在国民党统治下没有可能学习到毛主席底著作，但严重的是，以后一直没有检查和改正这个错误，更严重的是，一九五二年我检查出了这个错误，但对这个错误底性质及其他的错误依然不能够认识。当时，一直到这以前不久，我认为这个错误论断只是个别的，我的其他的论点如果有错误也只是个别的。但情形恰恰相反。
    事实上，这不简单是一个对五四运动当时的领导思想的判断的个别错误。在我的文字里，这种错误以后一直在不同的形式上出现着。
      这是对于中国革命的反帝反封建的政治纲领的性质的认识问题。反帝反封建的政治纲领，是中国工人阶级在民主革命阶段的具体纲领，但只是工人阶级底最低纲领。这在理论上我是认识的，但在理解政治纲领下面的文艺实践底广泛基础的时候，却陷入了错误。因为我只是从文艺实践底广泛的现实基础，只是从这个纲领底下面去提出要求和区别各种实践底内容和发展程度，企图在那里面追求先进的东西，而不能从指导这个纲领的最高原则上把握住实践内容，于是就把符合这个纲领要求的东西和工人阶级的立场混淆了起来，把“人民大众”的内容和“工人阶级”的内容混淆了起来，把领导的与被领导的混淆了起来，结果必然是，用小资产阶级的立场混淆了工人阶级的立场。这种严重错误实质上是资产阶级思想底反映。这是从对党的思想原则缺乏追求的精神而来的错误，这是仅仅从局部实践观点而不从政治看问题而来的错误，但根本上，是从自己的小资产阶级立场而来的错误。这是根本上违反马克思主义的。由于这种错误，我就产生了严重的偏向，仅仅强调共产党领导下的反帝反封建的思想要求，而忽略了工人阶级立场；仅仅强调在反帝反封建的思想要求下随处都可以进入实践，通过实践过程去解决问题，而陷进了狭隘的实践观点，贬低了革命理论对于文艺实践的指导作用；仅仅强调实践态度而模糊了阶级观点，并且回避着立场改造的问题；有时表现为“左”的教条主义，但实质上是右倾的思想。多年以来，我只是注重在对文艺创作实践的探求，因而，在作家与政治的关系上，我的理解仅仅停留在作家应该在反帝反封建的斗争下面从事实践这一点上，而不能对领导这一斗争的政治原则作进一步的追求。根本问题就在这里。由于长期没有把这当作一个根本问题，我就在有关文艺实践的具体问题上犯了与工人阶级立场游离甚至背道而驰的严重错误。
    我的对于现实主义的理解，是从斯大林这个说法得来的：
    写真实！让作家在生活中学习罢！如果他能以高度艺术形式反映生活真实，他就一定会达到马克思主义。
    在解放前的十多年中间，我在当时的条件下面从事文字工作，企图探求作家与生活的关系和现实主义的实践过程，要求作家反映“生活真实”，在人民解放、人类解放的远景下面为反帝反封建斗争服务。我认为，作家底思想认识须得变成他自己的血肉要求，否则在创作实践里会产生用概念代替真实的后果。但我多年来却局限于这样的实践观点，产生了贬低理论底指导作用的偏向；贬低了理论底指导作用，我所要求的“作家底思想认识”以及“人民解放、人类解放的远景”等，就必定是模糊的。因而，作家应该写出走向未来的真实这一要求，就不能在最有利的条件下得到保证。
    斯大林底说法，应该是这样理解的：作为一个前提要求看，社会主义作家应该掌握马克思主义，但不能像“拉普派”那样武断和粗暴地要求，而是应该帮助他们从实践去解决，同时，对于作家说来，如果他一时远不能掌握马克思主义，但通过向生活学习和“写真实”的创作道路，在实践中认识真理，他也就会达到马克思主义的。
      同时，在理解斯大林这一说法所强调的实践观点的时候，应该和斯大林底另一原则，即“离开理论的实践是盲目的实践”联系起来看。这就是说，作家通过生活和创作的实践，固然有可能写出真实，认识真理，在这一意义上达到马克思主义，但马克思主义对于文艺实践却是有着重要的指导作用的。正如毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”里所指出：“必须有马克思列宁主义的知识”，“文艺工作者应该学习文艺创作，这是对的，但是马克思列宁主义是一切革命者都应该学习的科学，文艺工作者不能是例外。”（“毛泽东选集”，第三卷八五四页）
      然而，我过去对斯大林底说法却作了片面的简单的理解，虽然也提到过理论底指导作用，但却经常抛开这一点，强调“在生活中学习”和在创作实践中达到真理。片面强调的结果，我就把“写真实”这一说法和“离开理论的实践是盲目的实践”这一原则分离开来，犯了忽视以至贬低马克思主义对于创作实践的指导作用的错误。我这种对马克思主义、对实践的态度，是违反了马克思主义的。
    我年轻的时候痛切地感到过庸俗机械论底危害。在苏联清算“拉普”的影响之下，我反对对于文学创作的简单的理解，但由于未能很好改造自己，就更被狭隘的实践观点所限制，助长了贬低理论指导作用的这种错误，并且对一般的理论宣传工作采取了严重的轻视态度。
    在我的对现实主义创作实践的理解里，第二个要点是，作家必须有和人民共命运的立场，在现实斗争中对于敌、友、我的爱爱仇仇的态度，革命的人道主义精神。我认为，这种精神应该而且可能是从反帝反封建的人民解放的革命思想要求产生的，我把这叫做“主观精神”或“主观战斗精神”。在这一点上，我的错误是，在把这种精神当作实践态度来强调的时候，却模糊了一个根本问题，即作家当时的反帝反封建的要求是带着各种非无产阶级的东西的。一般地说，作家凭着一定的积极的实践态度，在实践过程中可以逐渐地克服自己的错误和变革自己，但同时必须提出，这一实践态度和实践要求，是需要争取正确的立场底保证的。关于“态度问题”，毛主席说：“随着立场，就发生我们对于各种具体事物所采取的具体态度。”我只是要求建立实践的态度，在实践中去克服错误和逐渐变革自己，却没有同时认识到，立场及立场底改造是有着决定态度的性质，并起着对实践的保证作用的这一根本问题，因此就必定产生模糊以至抹煞阶级观点的错误。当时的国民党统治区的作家，一般地没有建立工人阶级立场，而是有着各种性质的反帝反封建的思想要求，大多数是从小资产阶级立场来的反帝反封建的要求。那虽然能够在一定程度上符合党在那个时期的政治纲领，却又是有着动摇性和不彻底性的。我强调了他们的要求符合党的政治纲领的一面，提出了实践态度（“主观战斗精神”）的重要，但由于我把符合党的政治纲领要求的东西和工人阶级立场混淆了起来，就模糊了以至抹煞了对于包含着各种性质的小资产阶级的实践态度和实践要求，同时必须从原则上提出改造立场的问题。这是和毛主席关于思想改造的指示背道而驰的。在表面意识上是以为在那样的环境下面不可能提出并解决这个问题，但实际上却是由于没有认识到这个问题非得在具体实践中贯彻不可的原则性的意义。此外，在我的文章里，“主观精神”这一用语底含义时常是不一样的，主要的是指上面说的实践态度，但有时又指作家反映现实的主观作用，有时又指世界观，又有时指的爱国主义的浪漫主义热情。这反映了我思想上的混乱。而且，有的说法，例如“仁爱的胸怀”等，脱离了阶级内容，变成唯心论的抽象的东西了。我片面地强调实践态度，抹煞阶级观点，以至陷入了唯心论的错误。
    因为多半是从创作实践过程和创作方法这个范围来看问题，我也就没有明确地理解到过去现实主义和社会主义现实主义之间的区别。过去的现实主义和社会主义的现实主义当然都是反映现实的，但是，作家底阶级区别以及这种区别（世界观、立场）在作品中的反映却是不容忽视的，而且，产生了社会主义现实主义的，是无产阶级革命时代的现实，作家的党性立场是有别于过去一切时代的，这就产生了它的方法上的强大的力量。虽然我指出了过去的现实主义者们所受到的阶级立场的限制，但更多地是结合着自己当时感到的实践要求，赞扬了那忠于现实的态度和创作方法，作为我们的借鉴，而没有把他们的现实主义的到达点和社会主义现实主义的要求作出明确的比较和区别来。
    虽然我也一般地说到了社会主义现实主义的传统（高尔基和鲁迅的道路）和实践内容（表现“先进人民”等），并且知道他和过去的现实主义的区别是在于“从现实的革命的发展中”去描写现实和
  “用社会主义精神从思想上教育和改造劳动人民”，但我对这两个任务的理解是不明确的。直到解放后，我仍然只强调作家从拥护党的政治纲领的创作实践出发，就可以吸取社会主义精神，“在革命的发展中”描写现实，并能够在写出真实来这一意义上“达到”马克思主义，而严重地轻视了作家只有在马克思主义底指导之下，才能深刻地充分地达到“在革命的发展中”描写现实，和充分地站在党性立场上具有社会主义精神。在我的文字里，一直强调现实主义的创作方法的作用而忽视了世界观的作用。
      在当时国民党统治区的作家，对于马克思主义的认识一般是不明确的，有的是根本没有认识的。他们从实践出发，在党所领导的反帝反封建的斗争中，在一定程度上是能够反映出当时的现实斗争的，而且也有可能在革命思想底影响下从忠于现实的态度和创作方法争取克服自己的思想里的错误，在向生活学习和“写真实”的过程中达到社会主义现实主义。如同前面所分析的，我的错误仍然在于我仅仅强调现实主义的创作方法的作用，而严重地忽略了从实践出发和争取马克思主义指导之间的辩证关系。在当时的现实里，从实践出发固然有可能争取到现实主义的成就，但同时，作家如果不能在一定程度上接受马克思主义指导，仅仅凭着反帝反封建的思想认识，创作实践（认识现实）的过程是会更困难的，作家主观上的错误的思想感情是更难得到克服的。至于在今天的现实里，马克思主义起着领导国家建设的根本作用，因此，仅仅强调从生活学习和创作实践去解决问题，而贬低了马克思主义对于指导作家的重要作用，就会使作家不可能清楚地认识现实生活的变革和发展，有迷失方向的危险。
    我的其他论点的偏向和错误，分析起来也是类似的。
    关于“发现并反映自发性”的问题和“哪里有生活，哪里就有斗争”这一论点。在当时的国民党统治区，在文艺作品里反映劳动人民底自发的反抗要求，应该是具有现实意义的，在思想上和政治上是为了反帝反封建的总的要求服务的。当时的处在黑暗统治下的作家，在他们的实践条件下，能够在一定程度的真实性上把这描写出来，已经必须付出相当的努力，需要一定的革命立场。我的错误是在于，我在肯定这些努力的时候，没有强调地指出这些作品底局限性，并且，我虽然屡次说到作家在生活中锻炼，但由于把一般的反帝反封建的斗争要求和工人阶级立场混淆了起来，实际上就抹煞了改造立场问题。而在后来我和香港的同志们辩论的时候，反而把这些作品底局限性说成似乎绝对不可克服的，因而实际上是不认为它们有局限性了。小资产阶级出身的倾向于革命的作家底努力方向，当在于不断地克服自己的局限性，改造立场，争取在革命的发展中历史地具体地写出真实来，用社会主义的精神在思想上教育人民。当时的国民党统治区的一般作家，当然是受着客观条件和主观情况的限制的，很难做到这一点。可是，由于我的错误立场，又带着严重的错误情绪，我在辩论问题的时候，虽然在认识上是一般地接触到了作家应在革命的发展中写出真实来的各种主题内容，认为描写革命斗争的正面人物和胜利是一个首要任务，但在情绪上却用当时的限制来替自己辩护，回避改造立场的问题，于是在对文艺创作的要求上，就更多地着眼于现实主义底一般内容，而没有凸现出描写在革命斗争中的正面人物和胜利是用社会主义精神教育人民的首要内容。我的这种态度和观点，对当时革命的现实斗争向进步作家所提出的改造立场和深入有组织有领导的群众斗争这一努力目标，带来了有害的影响。这是和毛主席底文艺方针严重抵触的。
    “哪里有生活，哪里就有斗争”，同样地，是当时片面地脱离政治地从狭隘的实践看问题的。这个论点本身，一般说来，是没有错误的。但是，当时革命斗争正在发展，我这提法是直接违反了党在当时号召进步青年进入解放区并投入工农兵实际斗争中去得到思想改造，为进一步的革命需要准备力量这一政治要求。而且，就是从文艺实践本身说，这个论点如果不在改造立场的前提要求下面去提，那是也会引到对待生活和斗争的非政治倾向，模糊了政治对于文艺的领导作用的。更严重的是，当我和在香港的同志们辩论的时候，为了回护自己的观点，带着严重的对抗情绪，以致于把国民党统治区说成“此岸”，把香港的同志们所代表的党的政治要求说成“彼岸”，加以嘲笑，产生了极有害的政治影响。同志们责备我，说有的青年在我的这种见解的回护下拒绝到实际斗争中去，对这个，我是有严重责任的。在我的文字里，也曾提到过到实际斗争中去，但由于我的错误立场，那内容是不明确的，而且，长期的沉重的反动统治，使我的感情不能发展为比反抗具体环境的压迫更为积极的东西。这种思想情绪是以忠于此时此地的实践的面目出现的，以至于使我长期地不能认识自己，长期地违反毛主席底文艺方针，反而以毛主席底“环境和任务的区别”这一指示来辩护自己，这充分暴露了我的立场错误。
    在关于选择文学创作的题材问题上，我的错误也是类似的。为了使作家能在当时所能有的条件下进入实践，为了说明当时作家生活周围的社会斗争和劳苦人民底反抗要求的意义，我认为，对于具有革命要求的现实主义作家说来，从当时的民主斗争的广泛的客观基础（题材）里的任何一个方面，都可以取出相应的、通向斗争全体的、具有社会典型意义的主题和形象来。在这个问题上，我的错误正是和在反映自发的反抗要求那个问题上的错误关联着的。问题不在于肯定作家实践基础底广泛性，问题不在于从社会生活和斗争底任何一个方面都可以选择题材，问题仍然在于我在说明当时社会斗争和
  一般的劳动人民底反抗要求的意义时，带着安于现状的情绪，回避着深入革命群众底实际斗争的问题，没有凸现出描写正面人物和胜利是用社会主义精神教育劳动人民的首要内容。虽然一直在说深入生活，却不曾认识到深入革命群众底实际斗争的决定性的意义，反而用一般的生活斗争代替了革命群众底实际斗争，因而违反了毛主席底关于深入工农兵群众斗争的原则指示。
    在关于民族文学遗产的问题上，我也犯过虽然表现得不一样，但却实质相同的错误。在强调五四以来的革命文艺的斗争传统的时候，我错误地对待了民族的文学遗产。在当时的国民党统治区，总的说来，反动派正用民族文学遗产里的糟粕为武器向人民进攻，因而对这种情况的反抗情绪是可以理解的。但在“论民族形式问题”的论点里，我却从教条主义出发，错误地对待了民族文学遗产里的民主的、现实主义的内容。当时虽然我也肯定了民族文学遗产里有民主主义成分，但却从它们并未能“发展成作为认识现实改造现实的、群众性的、科学性的、实践的思想体系或生活态度”这一点看问题，严重地贬低了民族文学遗产底价值，不从作品历史内容底人民性的观点，而从抽象的原则出发去要求，这本身就是教条主义。这种教条主义，是带着
  “左”的情绪出现的。而且，由于我的错误立场，又被这种“左”的情绪所膨胀，对一些同志们采取了自以为是的个人主义态度，客观上对党所领导的文艺运动给了损害。除了理论本身错误以外，这个带政治性的错误更是不可原谅的。
    在我的文字里，除了不少用语没有科学性以外，还从资产阶级启蒙文化里借用了一些概念和词句，例如“人格力量”，“主观精神”，等等。我使用这些概念和词句，是因为我感到它们曾经在资产阶级反封建的革命里发生过积极作用，能够对当时苦闷的压迫和虚浮的颓废气氛做一些反抗，但是，这些原来属于唯心论的概念和词句，多半的场合在全文当中并未被我提出的实践内容和思想要求以及附与它们的含义所占领，却使我反而成了它们的俘虏了。这也反映了我的思想是和资产阶级思想有着千丝万缕的联系的。
    由于从我的这种错误立场而来的对于当时反动的沉重压迫的脱离政治的、盲目的反抗情绪，实质上在许多观点上把个人主义思想也当作了武器，那看来好像是反抗了黑暗，但同时也抵抗了集体主义。由于这种思想和其他情况，我在我后期主编的刊物上发表过“论主观”等实质上是宣传唯心论和个人主义的文章，在读者中间造成了有害的影响。对于这，我长期地只是把它当作一个发表的责任看，不能认识到这是从立场错误而来的、一个违反了党的思想原则的带政治性的严重错误。
    回顾我二十多年来的文学工作，由于我长期在具体工作上脱离领导，不靠拢领导，没有能得到改造，以至产生了一系列的错误。更严重的问题是，我长期地不能认识错误，并且解放后一直坚持错误，以至于我的错误倾向有了恶性的发展。不改正错误，自以为是，轻视集体，并且用局部的实践观点和过去狭隘经验来看新的现实，就必然愈陷愈深。由于这一次思想运动，由于同志们底批评，我才逐渐地开始认识到了我的问题。
    这些错误的根源在哪里呢？它们是什么一种性质？
    前面说过，这一切当然是因为我的小资产阶级的立场没有得到改造，把自己追随革命事业的革命性和立场当做工人阶级的革命性和立场，模糊了这中间的区别，这就是我前面简单地分析了的错误底阶级根源。
    解放五年来，我没有正视并发现自己的错误，更没有努力从政治原则上认识错误，因而这种错误就恶性地发展了。
    “任何没有无产阶级化的小资产阶级分子的革命性，在本质上和无产阶级革命性不相同，而且这种差别往往可能发展成为对抗状态。”（“毛泽东选集”第三卷，九九三页）
    问题还可以在具体内容上前进一步。
    从我的情况说来，多年以来，我凭着从古典作家和苏联作家得到一些关于创作实践的体会，和我自己在文学工作中所积累的一些实践经验来看问题，又被局部的实践所限制，因而往往“把片面的相对的真理夸大为普遍的绝对的真理；他们的思想都不符合于客观的全面的实际情况”（同上，九九○页）。这是由于：“联系生产的小资产阶级分子虽具有一定的感性知识，但是受着小生产的狭隘性、散漫性、孤立性和保守性的限制，他们的思想方法就比较容易表现为我们前面所说的经验主义。”（同上，九九四页）这就是我前面所简单分析了的错误底思想根源。
    因此，我的错误还向着一个更严重的方向发展了。这就是，长期以来，由于脱离集体，个人奋斗，滋长了宗派情绪，不肯倾向同志们底批评和发展自我批评。这就在解放前的一些辩论中发展成不顾政治影响以及目无大局的严重情况，例如在“论现实主义的路”里所表现出来的。
    在“论现实主义的路”（一九四八年）里面，为了辩护我的一些文艺理解，被强烈的宗派情绪所鼓舞，我就把我的一些关于文艺创作的狭隘的实践要求和理解推广至一般的重大的问题上去，用这去看、其实是“套”客观现实，自以为是地解释了党的思想原则和政治要求，今天看来，实际上是用自己的小资产阶级的立场曲解即反对了党的思想原则和政治要求的。在这些问题上，在上面偏重于平列叙述的论点里面还不能明确看出的、我的思想方法上的主观片面性和它的危险倾向，就鲜明地暴露了出来。
      由于在文艺创作问题上强调作家底生活实践和创作实践，强调通过实践去达到真理，我就主观主义地、片面地强调了“理论或原则，应该是从‘具体历史或现实’提升出来”，强调了“理论或原则，只能从历史要求或实践性质来衡量”。但我所说的“历史要求”，虽然在理性上是指的工人阶级所领导的走向未来的斗争方向，但在实际感受上并没有能够取得比自己的小资产阶级立场所能感受到的一般的反帝反封建的要求更进一步的思想内容，我所说的“实践性质”，又指的是例如知识分子作家们底“在自己的处境里面寻求有效的实践方式去开拓人民底道路”这种狭隘的实践途径。那么，这必然的逻辑的结果是，“在自己的处境里面”所感受不到的，对自己说来就是“无效的”，因而也就是空洞的“一般性的原则”了。
    不用说，作家的思想，应该像血液似地流贯在作品里的形象底运动过程里面。这是要在创作过程中去实现的。但我却把这个理解推广到一般问题上去，说：“思想（意识），不能是逻辑公式平面上的
  ‘思想’，非得成为‘意识的存在’，即从现实要求来的主观的要求不可。”就创作过程中的形象的思维说，就作家底创作成果说，思想当然不能是逻辑公式平面上的，但我推广了这一点，丢掉了思想原则在生活实践和研究过程中对于作家的巨大的指导作用，由这逐渐成为作家在创作过程中的内在要求，以至改造作家底不正确的内在要求。而且还进一步就创作过程以外的一般问题这样说：“实践性的真实的思想（“理性”），决不能不是‘感性的活动’底内容，不能不成为热情的实践态度，所以，被压迫者底代言人所表现的仇恨是‘一切智慧之母’”。这种说法，实际上是把指导实践的马克思主义思想变为自发性的“感性的活动”底内容、“实践态度”、“仇恨”，也就是我所说的“主观战斗精神”了。这实质上是会达到取消作为客观真理的马克思主义，是会达到取消没有被感性接触到的、但为革命理论所反映的客观现实底发展规律的。从狭隘的创作实践要求所产生的片面性的主观主义的思想方法，就这样曲曲折折地通向了主观唯心论。
    这也表现在其他的论点和问题上面。
    为了辩护狭隘的实践要求，我强调了作家底“主观战斗精神”、“真诚的思想要求”，等。离开了立场问题的前提要求，这“真诚”应该是很难说的。每一个人都可以认为自己是真诚的，并以这为武器来证明别人是不真诚的。这就丧失了客观标准，要引向主观随意性的结果。事实上正是这样，我自己和我影响下的人们，被宗派情绪所膨胀，觉得自己是真诚的，主观主义地攻击了革命阵营里的一些作家是不真诚的。因而，我的真诚就落到了一个主观标准上面，即，以“自己的处境”里的具体的实践为武器的，对于实际上是小资产阶级的感受的真诚底完全肯定上面。
    从这进一步，我曲解了思想革命，即根据地的整风运动。我没有理解到党的整风运动是以反对资产阶级小资产阶级思想在革命队伍中的反映为主要内容，而认为整风运动里所提出的反教条主义就是和我自己的反主观公式主义相符合的，这就把反教条主义的伟大的革命任务庸俗化了。我正是用整风运动所反对的我的小资产阶级立场和狭隘的实践要求去曲解了反教条主义。因此，我就仅仅停留在
  “新民主主义的思想要求”这个一般的说法上面，说整风运动对于国民党统治区作家的意义底“中心点是争取主观的思想立场或思想要求的加强”，这所谓“加强”，是直接地从根本上曲解了“从一个阶级改变到另一个阶级”的改造立场的原则意义的。而且，不从思想实质上，而仅仅从知识分子底“优越感”、“幻想”、“虚浮的精神状态”等去说明知识分子需要改造，也是从这种对于思想改造的主观主义的曲解而来的。这也就当然不能够真正理解作家和人民结合的问题。五四以来，小资产阶级出身的倾向革命的作家，在马克思主义和革命斗争底影响下面，和人民是有着一定程度的联系以至血缘关系的；我为了鼓励实践努力而肯定了这一点，但却把这个一定程度的对人民的同情和感受当做了就是和人民的结合。把存在着的和人民的距离不当作严重问题，而不把不存在的和人民的真正结合当作艰苦的斗争方向。这是我的实践的感受，我的“自己的处境”，我的对原则的轻视的结果，一方面是我的立场问题，一方面是从我的立场所产生的主观主义思想方法的结果。
    从狭隘的实践要求去看客观的革命现实，那就必然要犯更严重的错误。我用这一类的说法叙述了当时国民党统治区文艺斗争底任务：“被新民主主义的思想要求所照明，被先进人民底英勇战绩所招引，在这个灰色战场上的文艺斗争，它的中心目标是要体现人民底负担、觉醒、潜力、愿望、和夺取生路这个火热而坚强的主观的思想要求，也就是为了反映人民底负担、觉醒、潜力、愿望、和夺取生路这个火热而丰富的客观的历史内容的”，说这是“无处不在的历史现实”。这里所要求的第二种真实，即通向未来的真实，在理性上虽然是指的在党的领导下的革命斗争中的现实，但在实际感受上却在当时国民党统治区的斗争里面模糊了主导性的内容，即工人阶级先锋队底领导作用和领导力量。因而这里所叙述的人民底觉醒和夺取生路等历史现实，实质上只能是指自发的反抗要求说的，而这里所说的“新民主主义的思想要求”，虽然在理性上是指的工人阶级所领导的走向未来的斗争方向，但在实际感受上并不能够取得比我的立场、“处境”所能感受到的一般的反帝反封建的要求更高一步的思想内容。这就夸大了自发性，其逻辑的必然结果是排斥了领导。
    既然不能够站在“自己的处境里面”所未能感受到的革命现实的高度去看问题，从“自己的处境”出发，因而常常把感情集中到旧社会的黑暗统治上面，感觉特别鲜明，把我所在的“泥塘”夸大成庞大得挡住一切的现实内容，在对人民的感受上夸大了“精神奴役的创伤”。而且更进一步，在对于人民力量的叙述里面，把人民作为历史底伟大的创造者这一面看得轻，反而把人民作为阶级压迫底受难者这一面看得重了；在对于敌对思想给与革命的损害的叙述里面，就直接用自己的主观感受代替了客观现实，把革命内部的偏向和错误，即敌对阶级的思想在革命内部的反映和危害，也归到人民底
  “精神奴役创伤”上面，说成是“虐杀千万生灵可怕的屠刀”，达到了歪曲革命内部斗争的不可原谅的错误。这样地理解革命现实，是直接地跌进了主观唯心论的。
      由于“自己的处境”和狭隘的实践要求，表现在对于现实的理解上，就片面地解释了、实质上是割裂了列宁底关于辩证法的原则。强调了从个别的事物通到一般的事物，而丢掉了一般的事物对于理解个别事物的指导作用；强调了“从一粒砂看世界”，而丢掉了“从世界看一粒砂”；强调了“阶级是在活的个别的阶级成员里面，或通过他而存在的；离开了具体的活的阶级成员就没有阶级”，而丢掉了原则性的阶级概念和阶级这一集体的历史内容对于理解阶级成员的指导作用。这种从狭隘的实践观点而来的片面化的理解，实际上是重个人而轻视集体的个人主义思想底反映。
    但在这些错误以外，“论现实主义的路”在关于文艺运动的现实问题上更犯了极其严重的错误。
    第一，在关于抗战期间文艺发展叙述里面，我表现了强烈的宗派情绪，对现实文艺情况下了一些不可容忍的错误的判断。我把自己叙述成了现实主义底保卫者，把我所肯定的作品以至在我影响下的作家们说成了现实主义底坚持者。这就造成了和整个文艺运动，实际上是党所领导的文艺运动对抗的结果，使我进一步地陷进了小资产阶级的立场里面。
    第二，再加上对于一些党的作家们所采取的目中无人的强烈的对立态度，造成了实质上是和党对抗的结果，在政治上产生了极其有害的影响。
    在检查到这些内容的时候，我更是深深地感到了惭愧和痛苦的。
    而且，更不可原谅的是，到解放以后，我的这种有害的、狭隘的宗派情绪以及自以为是的个人英雄主义根本没有克服，对解放后的人民文艺运动采取了冷淡的态度，对文艺运动的实践情况不了解，却又自以为是。近年来，这种错误更加发展了，从个人的对立情绪出发，我凭感想和零碎的事实对文艺运动作出了主观的粗暴的论断，终于发展成为和党所领导的文艺运动直接采取反对态度的严重错误，在文联及作家协会主席团扩大会议上的发言，就是一个典型的例子。
    如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的。一些牺牲了的先烈们和一直忠贞战斗着的同志们引导过我，教导过我，有些同志长期以来规劝过我，期待着我。正因为我个人的一点微小的工作是从伟大的革命事业而来，所以我的错误就给革命事业带来了不应该有的损失。解放前许多年，我在群众眼睛中不仅是一个单纯的作家，而且是一个站在党底周围的文学工作的组织者，这就使我的错误在性质上更为严重。我对于应该从我得到较好的帮助的青年同志们感到了悔恨性的内疚。我沉痛地感到辜负了人民，辜负了党和阶级事业，辜负了伟大的时代。
    这次思想运动才使我觉醒过来，帮助我前进了一步。现在把我的初步认识提供同志们作为讨论的参考，希望得到同志们底继续帮助。在同志们底批判和帮助之下，我将对我自己的思想继续进行深入的全面的检查。在党底领导下面改造自己，努力学习，并争取努力工作，以求逐渐解除我过去的错误所带来的负债的痛苦。（一九五五年一月十一日）
　　对“关于几个理论性问题的说明材料”的检查
    在一九五四年三月——四月，我写了“关于几个理论性问题的说明材料”。我写这个“材料”的当时，自己觉得应该把几年来对于文艺工作的意见提出来，知无不言，毫无顾忌，这才符合党的要求；但今天看来，我写这个“材料”恰恰是从小资产阶级的狂热的抗拒心理出发的，与党的批评与自我批评的精神完全背道而驰。因而，在“材料”里，我的上述的论点和态度底错误有了恶性的发展。在写前面的自我批判的时候，内容虽然包括了这“材料”里面的论点底错误，但没有正面提到这些错误底发展程度。现在，“材料”预备发表出来由群众进行讨论和批判，我应当在“我的自我批判”后面，除了那里已经说过的以外，直接对“材料”里发展了的错误作一补充的检讨。
    在“材料”里，我不仅仍然强调反帝反封建的政治纲领是工人阶级立场底具体要求，认为只要在这个纲领底领导下就可以一步一步达到工人阶级立场，于是把符合于这个纲领的东西和工人阶级立场混淆了起来，把“人民大众”的内容和“工人阶级”的内容混淆了起来，而且发展到了用符合这纲领的东西来抹煞工人阶级立场，用“人民大众”的内容来抹煞工人阶级立场的程度，实际上就是用小资产阶级立场来抹煞工人阶级立场了。因而，在对文艺运动的理解里，不能把领导思想和被领导的实践内容辩证地去认识，这就歪曲了文学的党性原则和毛主席关于立场的指示。如果说在过去的环境里我没有能够追求到这个根本的政治原则，没有能够认识到自己的错误，是被狭隘的文艺实践所蒙蔽，那么，在解放几年之后，我不但没有认识错误，反而发展了错误，就只能证明我的小资产阶级立场底顽固性。我过去一直用毛主席底“环境和任务的区别”这一指示来替自己的局限性和错误立场辩护，但今天，“环境和任务的区别”已不存在，我的错误便更鲜明地暴露出来了。例如我说：“对于人民的态度问题。这既是无产阶级政治纲领底基础，同时也是文艺创作底生命。”这里，我不但用阶级立场模糊的“对人民的态度”来掉换了无产阶级立场，而且把这种立场模糊的“态度”说成了“无产阶级政治纲领底基础”，这就抹煞了马克思列宁主义与中国革命实际相结合的客观现实。这是不可容忍的。
      在“材料”里，关于现实主义的问题，我引用了毛主席底话：“马克思主义只能包括而不能代替文艺创作中的现实主义”，得出结论来说：“马克思主义包括了现实主义，通过现实主义就会达到马克思主义的。”这是对毛主席底话作了严重的歪曲。毛主席底这个指示的意思应该是：马克思主义包括了现实主义，同时现实主义又是唯物主义认识论在艺术认识上的特殊方式；因此，应该只能用马克思主义来指导和研究现实主义的实践，但却不能用马克思主义来代替现实主义。而我从过去的错误出发，陷入了这样的严重错误：只要现实主义的特殊规律，抹煞了马克思主义理论对于文艺实践的巨大指导作用，把毛主席的话也曲解了来替自己辩护。而且还一律把理论说成了“先验的”，这就实质上否定了争取获得马克思列宁主义世界观的努力。
    在“材料”里，在“哪里有生活，哪里就有斗争”这一类论点上，我继续替自己的实质上是安于当时局部实践的狭小圈子和非政治的态度辩护，发展了我的错误；最不可原谅的是，拿当时学生运动底某些个别情况来替自己辩护。而且，用过去的错误观点来看今天的现实，实际上是抹煞了深入工农兵对于改造思想的关键性的作用。我说明了作家应该在日常生活中积累感情经验和锻炼品质，但这个片面的提法实质上是否定了今天的作家非得深入工农兵群众中得到思想改造、即思想感情的痛苦磨炼，就不能达到毛主席所指示的把立足点移过来，从一个阶级变到另一个阶级，达到在工人阶级的立足点上去审核在日常生活中积累感情经验和锻炼品质的基础，反而会停留在不健康的错误的感情经验底原有性质上面，成为它们的俘虏的。
    “材料”里面关于民族文学遗产的问题上，我的错误同样发展了。我从斯大林底关于近代民族的定义和列宁底关于民族文化的说法出发，教条主义地来衡量我们民族的文学遗产，认为我们民族文学遗产里虽然有着“多少带有民主主义性和社会主义性的东西”，但这“多少带有民主主义性和社会主义性的东西”和“优良的传统”是“两回事”，这就暴露了我对于民族文学遗产的庸俗社会学的、实质上是资产阶级的观点，和虚无主义的态度。同时我说，“思想材料”和优良的传统并不是一件事，用这个来否认了优良的传统应该是“思想材料”里更为重要的东西。而且，从这里出发，我把几年来客观情况中的某些缺点夸大为主要倾向，得出了实际上认为重视民族文学遗产是民族复古主义的错误结论，这是根本和马克思主义背道而驰的。
    在思想改造的问题上，我过去一直是从回避改造的情绪和小资产阶级立场出发，虽然说明了知识分子底二重性，但却常常强调他们的革命性。并且，在内心深处，是把自己的局部实践当做了就是参加革命实践，因而是抹煞了在党底组织领导下的革命实践和在党底周围的追随革命的实践在性质上的区别。从这一点看来，我所强调的在实践中逐渐变革自己的这种说法，它同时是反映了我并没有真正感受到思想改造的原则性的意义，反映了知识分子底软弱性和回避改造的心情的。
    在“材料”里，我从这种错误立场来看今天的现实，因而发展了我的错误。文艺工作者底思想改造，无疑地应该从学习马克思主义和参加实际斗争联系着创作实践去进行，但我却为了回护我的错误，仅仅强调了忠于现实的创作实践对于作家的自我变革的作用。在“材料”里我实质上是抱着拒绝改造的态度。而且，不仅如此。正如毛主席所指出的：“小资产阶级出身的人们总是经过种种方法，也经过文学艺术的方法，顽强地表现他们自己，宣传他们自己的主张，要求人们按照小资产阶级知识分子的面貌来改造党，改造世界。”（“毛泽东选集”第三卷，八七七页）我抹煞了今天的作家底政治上的区别，荒谬地攻击了“改造好了的”、“经过改造但没有改造好的”、“没有经过改造的”等说法，我把这作为文艺上的一种宗派主义的现象来提出，而且把实践情况中的某些缺点和基本原则混淆了起来，把实际上是革命现实对作家提出的要求说成了“棍子”和“刀子”。这表现了我的顽固的资产阶级自由主义思想和拉普文艺离开政治的资产阶级思想，我的错误的立场已经发展为对工人阶级立场的攻击了。我抹煞了几年来党所领导的文艺运动，把其中的内容一律断定为宗派主义，这不仅仅是一种主观的臆断，违背了实事求是的精神，而且是丧失了起码的政治原则的。回过来检查我自己，我恰恰是没有经过改造而拒绝改造的。
    在“材料”里，我没有经过反复的慎重的研究，轻率地引用了马克思主义经典著作和毛主席底著作来辩护自己的见解，这种工作态度是不可容忍的。在文联和文协主席团扩大会上的发言里面，我提出了对于马克思主义的态度问题，事实上，像周扬同志所批评的，恰恰是应该把这个问题提出来责备我自己的。
    在“材料”里，我对一些情况的理解是主观片面的，我凭着这些主观片面的理解，怀着宗派主义的成见和腐朽的个人主义情绪，攻击了党的文艺领导干部，攻击了过去用期待我认识错误的善意批评过我的同志们，实际上是对党的领导表现了顽强的反对态度。因此，我不仅是模糊了自己的小资产阶级革命性和工人阶级革命性的区别，而且发展成了以自己小资产阶级的立场来顽强地反对以至攻击工人阶级立场的极其严重的状态了。
    我感谢同志们指出了我的这种发展下去会不堪设想的错误，使我多次地玩忽了同志们底批评之后，仍然能够再一次地得到了一个“大喝一声”的警告。我渴望深入地认识错误，改正错误。我的这个补充检讨一定是不深刻不全面的，希望继续得到同志们底帮助和批判。（一九五五年一月十六日）
                ——一九五五年二月五日修改。
　　附记：这个自我批判，是在一月中旬写成，后来再作过部分的补充修改的。当时检查后发现错误严重，觉得应当把自己开始认识到的一些问题作一初步检讨，跟着再做深入的检查。现在，“关于几个理论性问题的说明材料”已经发表了，同志们对我的错误展开了讨论和批判；我已认识到这个批判是必要的，适时的，而且更明确地认识到了我的错误对于我们社会主义改造时期的文学事业是有极大的危害性的。今天看来，我觉得这个自我批判很不够，没有深入地分析清楚问题底具体内容和错误底思想实质，也许还含有新的错误。但目前限于水平和时间等条件，希望同志们把它当做我自己拥护对我的错误的批判的一种表示看。我要努力从同志们底批评当中进行学习和反省，进入深一步的检查，写出新的文章来，清除和改正错误，用实际行动来弥补我的过失。（三月二十六日）
