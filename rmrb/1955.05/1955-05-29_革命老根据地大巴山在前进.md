To our dear editors:
    We, the people of the Dabashan area, would like to report to you and all those who care about the construction of the old revolutionary base area on the progress here.

    The Dabashan Mountains, straddling the provinces of Sichuan and Shaanxi, are the heartland of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Soviet Area during the Second Revolutionary Civil War and one of the many old revolutionary base areas in the country. Here, there are continuous mountain ranges, ancient forests where the sky is seldom seen, more than a thousand kinds of mountain products and medicinal materials, endless plateaus and terraced fields, abundant grains and miscellaneous crops, cattle and sheep covering the mountains, and endless poems of revolutionary struggle....

    After the national liberation, under Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," we vigorously restored our homes and built a happy and fulfilling socialist mountain area. Various types of production cooperatives have blossomed like a hundred flowers in various major districts and townships. Last winter and this spring, in the mountains of Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Wanyuan counties, three agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry integrated production cooperatives were established, further broadening the horizons of the people in the mountainous areas. Farmers in the mountainous areas have been clamoring to join agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperatives. Not long ago, when the Qinghuaxi Spring Light Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Wanyuan County was just established, the poor peasant Kou Xiantian, when applying to join, wrote down the birthdates of his entire family and the sufferings he had endured in the past in his application form. When asked why he wrote so much, he said: "Joining the cooperative means embarking on the socialist path, and these things should all be written down!" The elder Quan Yubi, who had previously served as the village Soviet chairman, said to everyone upon hearing about the establishment of an agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative: "This is the right way! When we carried out the land revolution twenty years ago, it was to realize socialism."

    Now that the cooperative has been established, the members' congress decided to build a pasture on the barren Niubeiliang grassland. While most of the male members went to build the pasture, the female members who remained at home took on the task of agricultural and forestry production. In addition to completing the field management of the spring crops, preparing for the summer crops, planting trees and cultivating forests, and picking and processing tea, they also sowed one hundred catties of tea seeds in a new-style tea garden and repaired a silted-up canal.

    May 6th, the day the Niubeiliang pasture was established, was also a typically clear day in the Dabashan area. On this day, the village was as lively as if it were a festival. Before dawn, many girls and young women, as usual, dressed in their most beloved clothes, and every household, as if in a competition, washed the cattle they were sending to the pasture until they were smooth and decorated them beautifully. As the sun rose, the crabapples and tung flowers all over the mountains and fields were particularly dazzling. Groups of yellow cattle, adorned with wildflowers and bells, poured from various mountain gullies towards the collective pasture.

    The poor mountains and wild forests of old China are now laughing in the new China, under the light of socialism! Now, building socialism has become the common thought and direction of effort for the people in our mountainous areas. We, the people of the old base area, have full confidence in building a socialist society together with the people of the whole country.

### 革命老根据地大巴山在前进

　　革命老根据地大巴山在前进亲爱的编辑同志：
    我们大巴山区的人民向你们和一切关心老根据地建设的人们报告一下这里前进的情况。
    横跨川陕两省的大巴山脉，是第二次国内革命战争时期川陕边苏区的心腹地带，是全国许多个革命老根据地之一；这里，有绵亘不断的丛山峻岭，有抬头不见天日的千年老林，有千百种以上的山货和药材，有一眼望不到边的高原和梯田，有丰盛的五谷和杂粮，有漫山遍野的牛羊，有写不完的革命斗争的诗章……。
    全国解放以后，我们在毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的指示下，大力恢复家园，建设幸福、美满的社会主义的山区。各种类型的生产合作社百花齐放似的盛开在各个主要区乡里。在去冬今春，在通（江）、南（江）、万（源）三县的大山里，又建立了三个农、林、牧业相结合的生产合作社，进一步扩大了大山地区人民的眼界，山区的农民纷纷要求参加农、林、牧业生产合作社。不久以前，当万源县青花溪春光农、林、牧业生产合作社刚成立时，贫农寇显田在这次申请入社时，他把全家人的生辰八字和过去受过的苦楚，都一五一十地写在申请书上，人家问他为什么要写这么多，他说：“入了社就是走上社会主义的道了，应该把这些事情都写上！”以前曾担任过村苏维埃主席的权玉碧老人一听说要办农、林、牧业生产合作社，逢人就说：“这一下就对啦！我们二十年以前闹土地革命时，就是为了要实现社会主义。”
    合作社办起来了，社员大会决定要在荒芜的牛背梁大草原上修建一个牧场。当大部分的男社员去修牧场的时候，留在家里的女社员就担负起了农林业生产任务。她们除完成了小春田间管理，大春生产准备、植树育林、采茶制茶以外，还点播了一百斤茶籽的新式茶园，修浚了一条淤塞的堰沟。
    五月六日，是牛背梁牧场成立的日子，也是大巴山区常有的晴朗的天气。这天，村子里像过节似的欢腾起来了。天还没有亮，许多姑娘们、少妇们照例穿戴起自己最心爱的衣着，家家户户像比赛似地把自己送往牧场集中的牛刷洗得很光滑，打扮得很美丽。太阳升起了，满山遍野的山里红和桐子花分外耀眼，一群一群的黄牛，披着野花，带着铃铛，从各个山沟里浩浩荡荡地向集体的牧场流去。
    旧中国的穷山野林，在新中国，在社会主义的光芒照耀下欢笑了！现在，建设社会主义，已成为我们山区人民共同的思想和努力方向，我们老根据地人民有充分的信心和全国人民一道建成社会主义社会。
