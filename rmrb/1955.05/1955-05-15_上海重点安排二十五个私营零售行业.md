　　Shanghai Focuses on Arranging Twenty-Five Private Retail Sectors

　　Since the first quarter of this year, Shanghai's state-owned commercial and other relevant departments have focused on arranging two-twenty-seven thousand private retail businesses in twenty-five sectors, following the policy of combining arrangement and transformation of private commerce. In the arrangement process, based on the turnover necessary for these twenty-five sectors to maintain business, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce appropriately withdrew some sales points and counters, relinquished some commodity varieties and sales targets, and rationally allocated sources of goods to them. At the same time, state-owned commerce established more wholesale institutions, lowered the wholesale starting point, simplified wholesale procedures, and experimented with a delivery system. State-owned companies also sent liaison officers to strengthen contact and management of private retailers. This not only made it easier for private retailers to purchase goods, accelerating capital turnover, but also laid the foundation for further socialist transformation. For some households in difficulty, state-owned commerce appropriately expanded their distribution and consignment business, and the People's Bank also provided loan support.

　　The sectors that have undergone key arrangements have now basically been able to maintain themselves. Among them, twenty-one sectors including cotton cloth, stationery, thermos bottles, rubber, new medicines, coal, southern goods, and cigarettes (with more than twenty-six thousand households and sixty-five thousand employees), business has exceeded or approached the level of maintenance; the business situation in other sectors has also improved. The negative sentiment of private retailers has been initially reversed. The tight market supply situation has also been eased.

　　At present, there are still problems of oversupply and irrational distribution of sales points in the arranged private retail sectors. In order to overcome this irrational phenomenon left over from the old society, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Commerce will plan to lead private retailers to adjust the private retail network, and will further expand the scope of arrangement and transformation.

　　While arranging private retail commerce, Shanghai's state-owned commerce has strengthened the wholesale links. In addition to the original one hundred and ten wholesale institutions, forty-six specialized wholesale institutions were added throughout the city in the first quarter. As a result, the proportion of state-owned retail in the first quarter is expected to decrease from 39.48 percent in the fourth quarter of 1954 to 33.32 percent, and the proportion of private retail has increased from 60.52 percent to 66.68 percent. In the entire social retail commerce, the proportion of state capitalism has increased from 20.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1954 to 25.65 percent. These state capitalist enterprises, sending requisition plans to state-owned companies, selling goods at prices stipulated by state-owned companies, improving business management under the direct leadership of state-owned companies, and serving consumers, thus further strengthened and consolidated the socialist economic factors in the commercial field.

### 上海重点安排二十五个私营零售行业

　　上海重点安排二十五个私营零售行业
    上海市国营商业等有关部门，从今年第一季度以来，按照对私营商业安排和改造相结合的方针，对二十五个私营零售行业两万七千多户进行了重点安排。在安排过程中，根据这二十五个行业维持营业所必需的营业额，国营商业和合作社商业适当地撤掉了一部分销售点和柜台，让出了一部分商品品种和销售对象，并合理地对他们分配货源。同时，国营商业增设了批发机构，降低了批发起点，并简化批发手续，试行送货制。国营公司还派出联络员，加强对私营零售商的联系和管理。这样不仅使私营零售商进货便利，能加速资金周转，还为进一步对他们进行社会主义改造打下了基础。对于一部分困难户，国营商业便适当扩大他们的经销和代销业务，人民银行也予以贷款照顾。
    经过重点安排的行业，目前基本上已经能够维持下来。其中棉布、文具、热水瓶、橡胶、新药、煤炭、南货、卷烟等二十一个行业（有两万六千多户，六万五千多名从业人员），营业已经超过或接近维持的水平；其他行业，营业情况也有好转。私营零售商经营消极的情绪已初步扭转。市场供应紧张的情况也得到缓和。
    目前，经过安排的私营零售行业，还存在着过剩和销售点分布不合理的情况。为了克服旧社会遗留下来的这种不合理的现象，上海市商业局将有计划地领导私营零售商进行私营零售网的调整工作，并将进一步扩大安排和改造的范围。
    安排私营零售商业的同时，上海市国营商业加强了批发环节。除原有的一百一十个批发机构外，第一季度全市又增设了四十六个专业批发机构。这样，第一季度国营零售比重预计已由一九五四年第四季度的百分之三十九点四八下降到百分之三十三点三二，私营零售比重已由百分之六十点五二上升到百分之六十六点六八。在整个社会零售商业中，国家资本主义的比重已由一九五四年第四季度的百分之二十点二上升到百分之二十五点六五。这些国家资本主义的企业，向国营公司编送要货计划，按国营公司规定的价格出售商品，在国营公司直接领导下，改善经营管理，为消费者服务，因而使社会主义经济因素在商业领域中得到了进一步的加强和巩固。（本报驻上海记者）
