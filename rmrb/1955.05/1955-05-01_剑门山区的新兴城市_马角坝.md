　　Majiaoba: An Emerging City in the Jianmen Mountains
　　Zǐ Píng, Mǎ Huá
　　Since the Baoji-Chengdu Railway opened to traffic in the Jianmen Mountain area of northern Sichuan, an emerging city—Majiaoba—has appeared in the valley.

　　Before liberation, transportation here was inconvenient. Many valuable local and special products could not be sold, such as tung oil seeds, codonopsis pilosula, tea, and honey. Some of them went moldy and rotten. The salt, cloth and other daily necessities needed by the people were very scarce. Farmers could only exchange a large bucket of corn for half a pound of salt, and many people could not afford salt for a long time. After liberation, the local department store vigorously purchased local and special products on the one hand, and transported industrial products and daily necessities from the city on the other hand, which changed the lives of the people. The farmers could buy two and a half kilograms of salt with the money from one bucket of corn. However, due to the limitations of transportation conditions in Jianmen Mountain, the goods to and from could only be carried by manpower. Many local and special products still could not be transported out of the mountain. The two iron mines near Majiaoba were not mined in large quantities due to transportation difficulties.

　　Since October 25, 1954, when the train arrived here, the appearance of Majiaoba has undergone great changes. At night, people can see dazzling electric lights as soon as they get off the train. Buildings have appeared near the station. The station is piled with machines, steel, cement, and local products, special products, and grains waiting to be shipped out. Many new tile houses have been built on the street. Banks, department stores, monopoly companies, bookstores, and cooperatives all have offices here. Whenever it is market day, the streets are crowded with people. Previously, there were only two or three traditional Chinese medicine doctors in Majiaoba, and the medicine was not complete. Now, there are not only Chinese and Western medicine clinics, but also health centers. People in the mountainous areas have never seen movies before, but now they can watch them.

　　After the opening of traffic, the economic outlook of Majiaoba has also undergone significant changes. The cooperative's turnover in the first month after the opening of traffic increased from 25,000 yuan to more than 36,000 yuan. The purchase of local and special products has also increased from more than a dozen to more than eighty. The cooperative's door is crowded with people all day long. The local state-owned Jiangyou Iron Mine is also planning to expand the mines near Majiaoba, and change the indigenous furnaces that used to produce more than 500 kilograms of molten iron per day into five-and-a-half-ton hot-blast stoves. With the prosperity of the economy, the living standards of the people have been further improved. Li Guoxiang, a farmer in Chengshui Township near Majiaoba, bought more than eighty feet of cloth this year for his family of four to make new clothes. People in the Jianmen Mountain area can also buy woolen sweaters and rubber shoes produced in Shanghai, Tianjin and other places.

　　剑门山区的新兴城市——马角坝
　　子平　马华
    宝成铁路通车到四川北部的剑门山区后，一座新兴的城市——马角坝在山谷中出现了。
    解放前，这里交通不便，很多贵重的土产和特产卖不出去，像桐子、泡参、茶叶、蜂糖等，有的放得生霉发臭；这里人民需要的盐、布匹等日常生活品又非常缺乏，农民用一大斗包谷只能换到八两盐，很多人长期吃不到盐。解放后，当地百货公司一面大力收购土产、特产，一面从城市运来工业品和生活必需品，使人民生活起了变化。农民用一斗包谷的钱可以买到五斤盐了。但由于剑门山交通条件的限制，往来的货物只有靠人力背运，很多土产特产仍旧运不出山，挨近马角坝的两个铁矿，也因运输困难而没有大量开采。
    自从一九五四年十月二十五日，火车通到这里后，马角坝的面貌就发生了很大变化。夜里，人们一下火车，就可以看见耀眼的电灯。车站附近出现了楼房。在车站上，堆满了机器、钢、水泥和急待运出的土产、特产和粮食。街上新修了许多瓦房。银行、百货公司、专卖公司、书店、合作社都在这里设有办事处。每当逢场赶集的日子，街上挤满了人。以前马角坝只有两三位中医，医药也不全，现在不仅有了中、西医诊疗所，还有保健站。山区的人们从来没有看过电影，现在也可以看到了。
    通车后，马角坝的经济面貌也有了显著的变化。合作社在通车后第一月的营业额，就由两万五千元，上升到三万六千多元。收购的土产、特产，也由十多种增加到八十多种。一天到晚，合作社的门前都挤满了人。地方国营江油铁矿也正在筹划扩大马角坝附近的矿场，把以前每天出一千多斤铁水的土炉子，改成五吨半的热风炉。随着经济的繁荣，人民的生活水平更加提高了。马角坝附近澄水乡农民李国祥，今年一家四口人就买了八十多尺布做新衣裳。剑门山区的人们也可买到上海、天津等地出产的绒衣、胶鞋了。
