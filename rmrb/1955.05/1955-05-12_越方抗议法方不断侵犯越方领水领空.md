Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 11th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 10th, General Van Tien Dung, Chief Delegate of the Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the Vietnam Central Joint Armistice Commission, protested to the General Command of the French Union Forces on May 7th against the French side's constant infringement of the territorial waters and airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and demanded that the French side immediately cease such actions.

In the note, Van Tien Dung listed many specific instances of French ships and aircraft infringing Vietnamese territorial waters and airspace in March and April, pointing out that these actions violated the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, violated Article 24 of the Armistice Agreement and Resolution No. 8 of the Central Joint Armistice Commission, and created an atmosphere unfavorable to the consolidation of peace in Vietnam.

The note pointed out that some of the above incidents occurred in areas where Ngo Dinh Diem's special agents were forcibly relocating residents. This further proves that the purpose of these actions is to encourage the plan to carry out the abduction of residents in areas controlled by the Vietnam People's Army, thereby violating Article 14(d) of the Armistice Agreement regarding freedom of choice and Article 15(d) regarding non-interference in local administration.

　　越方抗议法方不断侵犯越方领水领空
    新华社河内十一日电　据越南通讯社十日讯：越南中央联合停战委员会越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇将军在五月七日照会法兰西联邦部队总司令部，抗议法方不断侵犯越南民主共和国领水和领空的行为，并且要求法方立即停止这种行为。
    文进勇在照会中列举了法方船舰飞机在三、四月间侵犯越方领水和领空的许多具体事实，指出这些行为侵犯了越南民主共和国的主权，违反了停战协定第二十四条的规定和中央联合停战委员会第八号决议，并且造成了一种对于巩固越南和平的不利气氛。
    照会指出，上述事件有一些是发生在吴庭艳特务正在强迫居民迁移的地区。这进一步证明了这些行动的目的是鼓励在越南人民军控制的地区中实现劫运居民的计划，因而违反了停战协定第十四条丁款关于自由选择和第十五条丁款关于不得干涉当地行政的规定。
