　　The Illiteracy Eradication Work of Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory
　　Zhao Qingnian, Chang Shiye

    Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory has basically eliminated illiteracy. In 1950, illiterates accounted for 79% of the employees, but by 1954, the proportion of illiterates had dropped to 11%. Now, the cultural level of the vast majority of employees in the factory has been raised to the level of higher primary school and junior high school. For example, among 128 people in the iron smelting workshop, 22 can understand popular books, newspapers and picture magazines, 49 can read newspapers and foundry manuals, and 57 can understand relatively in-depth political and technical books and periodicals. They can generally write simple letters and personal production plans and work diaries.

    Because the employees, especially the production team leaders and trade union group leaders, can read and write and have improved their cultural level, new atmospheres have appeared in production leadership and technical learning. For example, Guo Fu, the production team leader of the steel casting team No. 2, could not write or calculate in the past, and did not know how to lead the team's production; he only knew how to work hard with everyone and could not lead everyone to come up with ideas. Now, with cultural knowledge, he can assign work according to the production work orders, write the team's production plan, specifically stipulate how many pieces should be made each day, and write in detail who should do how much, and post it on the wall for everyone to see. In this way, from the team leader to the team members, everyone knows what to do, overcoming the previous chaotic phenomenon. Moreover, everyone can check the drawings and samples, clearly and understandably, saving both labor and materials, and improving production efficiency in general.

    Due to the basic elimination of illiteracy and the improvement of cultural level, 95% of the factory's employees are now participating in technical learning, and generally understand the basic knowledge and operation methods of sand casting, thereby improving the quality of products. For example, when worker Yu Langui first made a three-foot-long figure-eight wheel, he couldn't calculate the "equal" distance, and two people worked for four days but still couldn't finish it; now that he has learned division, he can calculate the "equal" distance, and one person can finish the work in one day, and it meets the specifications. Some said, "If you can read books and newspapers, advanced experience won't escape you."

    The reason why Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory has achieved remarkable results in eliminating illiteracy is first and foremost because the leadership recognizes that eliminating illiteracy among employees is an important key to further improving technology and improving enterprise management. Therefore, in the work, the policy of "taking cultural education as the main focus and literacy education as the key point" was implemented, and the method of "from point to surface, starting from the forging and riveting workshop, and developing steadily" was adopted to inspire the workers' consciousness of learning, so that 80% of the workers participated in cultural learning. After the illiteracy elimination work was launched in 1952, the Party organization made a resolution on carrying out illiteracy elimination work; the trade union regarded illiteracy elimination as one of the three major tasks of the trade union; the enterprise administration adopted the method of transferring employees in batches to study away from production and transferred cadres to be teachers; the Communist Youth League general branch designated the propaganda committee member to participate in the illiteracy elimination work. Later, the illiteracy elimination work was conscientiously rectified, so that the cultural education of employees was brought into the normal track.

    Second, starting from reality, various organizational forms were adopted. For example, the production of the four workshops such as repair and distribution is relatively normal, and the shift time is also fixed; moreover, due to the use of machine production, the labor intensity is not great, coupled with the fact that there are fewer illiterates and more semi-literates, cultural learning adopts the form of spare-time classes. In 1952, these workshops completed the production tasks two months ahead of schedule, and there was a surplus of labor force, so the method was changed, and the form of transferring employees to study away from production was adopted. By the spring of 1953, the production plan had changed, so the number of people studying away from production was reduced according to the actual situation, and the study plan was also changed. At the end of 1954, the number of illiterates decreased, and they were mostly scattered in various workshops, and their levels were also uneven. The leadership adopted the form of "contracting teaching and learning" according to this situation, and mobilized literate people to contract teaching illiterate people. The spare-time school and the workshop signed a contract, the workshop was in charge of the "contracting teaching and learning" work, and the spare-time school provided business guidance.

    Experience has proved that only by changing the learning plan and organizational form at any time according to the changes and needs of production can we meet the employees' requirements for cultural learning and effectively serve industrial production.

    Third, teachers are selected and hired to ensure learning time. After the illiteracy elimination work started, the spare-time school sent people to go deep into the workshops, sections, and offices to conduct detailed investigations and formulate an illiteracy elimination plan. After the plan was determined, teachers were selected. The principle of hiring teachers is: any employee with a certain cultural level who is competent for the job can be hired by the spare-time school with his or her own voluntary consent and can be engaged in teaching work after a short period of training. When assigning courses, attention is also paid to each person's expertise. In daily teaching activities, on the one hand, attention is paid to the political and ideological education of teachers, on the other hand, teachers are constantly organized to exchange teaching experience, and model teachers are also rewarded to encourage everyone's enthusiasm.

    Fourth, inspire the workers' consciousness of learning and help them establish the concept of learning for production. When we first organized everyone to learn culture, many workers were afraid that they would not be able to learn, and that they would not be able to use what they learned; they were worried that participating in learning would delay production. Some said, "People who are half their lives are still becoming dragons, and learning for a long time is still just wielding a sledgehammer!" The factory carried out ideological education for the workers according to this situation, so that everyone realized the importance of learning culture.

　　太原矿山机器厂的扫除文盲工作
　　赵庆年  常士晔
    太原矿山机器厂，基本上已经扫除了文盲。一九五○年职工中的文盲占百分之七十九，到一九五四年文盲的比例数降为百分之十一。现在，全厂绝大部分职工的文化程度已提高到高小和初中水平。例如，熔铁车间一百二十八人中，有二十二人能看懂通俗书报画刊，四十九人能看报纸、铸工手册，五十七人能看懂比较深的政治技术书刊。他们一般都能写简单的书信，能写个人生产计划和工作日记等。
    由于职工，特别是生产小组长和工会小组长识了字，提高了文化水平，在生产领导和技术学习方面出现了新的气象。例如铸钢二组生产小组长郭富，过去他不会写、不会算，不知道怎样领导小组的生产；只知道和大家一齐埋头苦干，不能领导大家出主意。现在，他有了文化知识，等生产工票一下来，自己就能按活分工，写出小组的生产计划，并具体订出每天要做出多少件数，详细写出谁该做多少，贴在墙上让大家去看。这样，从组长到组员都是心中有数，克服了以往的混乱现象。而且大家可以看图检样，一清二白，既省工又省料，使生产效率普遍提高。
    由于基本上扫除了文盲，提高了文化水平，现在全厂职工中有百分之九十五的人参加了技术学习，一般都懂得了翻砂的基本知识和操作方法，从而提高了产品的质量。例如，工人余兰桂初做三尺大的八字轮时，因为不会算“均等”距离，一件活两个人干了四天还是没做好；现在他学会了除法，就能算“均等”距离，一人一天可以把活干完，而且合乎规格。有的说：“能看书、能看报，先进经验跑不掉。”
    太原矿山机器厂在扫除文盲工作方面所以能获得显著成绩，首先是在于领导方面认识到，扫除职工中的文盲是进一步提高技术、改善企业管理的重要关键。因此在工作中贯彻了“以文化教育为主，识字教育为重点”的方针，采取了“由点到面、从锻铆车间办起，稳步发展”的方法，启发职工的学习自觉性，使百分之八十的职工参加了文化学习。一九五二年扫除文盲工作展开以后，党组织做了关于开展扫除文盲工作的决议；工会把扫除文盲作为工会的三大任务之一；企业行政方面采取了分批抽调职工进行脱离生产学习的办法，并抽调干部当教师；团总支指定宣传委员参加扫除文盲工作。后来又认真地整顿了扫除文盲工作，使职工文化教育纳入了正常轨道。
    第二，从实际出发，采用多种多样的组织形式。例如修配等四个车间生产比较正常，倒班的时间也是固定的；而且由于使用机器生产，劳动强度不大，加上文盲较少、半文盲较多，因此文化学习便采用了业余班级教学的形式。一九五二年，这几个车间提前两个月完成了生产任务，劳动力有了剩余，便改变办法，采取了抽调职工进行脱离生产学习的形式。到一九五三年春，生产计划有了变化，就根据实际情况减少了脱离生产学习的人数，同时也改变了学习计划。一九五四年底，文盲减少，而且他们多分散在各车间，程度也参差不齐，领导方面便根据这个情况，采取“包教包学”的形式，发动识字的人包教不识字的人。并由业余学校和车间订立合同，车间主管“包教包学”的工作，业余学校则进行业务指导。
    经验证明：只有根据生产的变化和需要，随时改变学习计划和组织形式，才能满足职工对文化学习的要求，使之有效地为工业生产服务。
    第三，选聘教师，保证学习时间。在扫除文盲工作开始后，业余学校派人深入车间、科、室，进行细致的调查，制定了扫除文盲计划。在计划确定以后，即选择教师。聘请教师的原则是：凡有一定文化水平、能够胜任工作的职工，经本人自愿，由业余学校聘请，进行短期训练后就可担任教学工作。在分配课程时，又注意到每个人的特长。在日常教学活动中，一方面注意对教师的政治思想教育，一方面不断组织教师交流教学经验，同时还奖励模范教师，以鼓励大家的情绪。
    第四，启发职工的学习自觉性，并帮助其树立为生产而学习的观念。在开始组织大家学习文化的时候，许多职工怕学不成，学了用不上；耽心参加学习以后误生产。有的说：“半辈子的人还成龙呀，学习半天还不是个抡大锤的！”工厂方面根据这种情况，对工人们进行了思想教育，使大家认识到学好文化的重要性。
