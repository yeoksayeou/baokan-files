The 1.6 million mu of early rice in Jiangxi Province is generally growing well. The early rice in the four special districts of Nanchang, Shangrao, Fuzhou, and Ji'an has grown to six or seven inches high, with lush green and strong leaves, and has begun to tiller. In the Gannan area, where rice transplanting began earlier, the seedlings have grown to more than one and a half feet high, and some have already closed ranks. At present, farmers in various places are actively weeding and applying fertilizer. In the Gannan area, early rice has already received two applications of fertilizer, and farmers are now beginning the second weeding. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Longnan County have applied an average of more than 13 dan of fertilizer per mu. The early rice in Nanchang, Shangrao, Fuzhou, Ji'an and other special districts has completed the first weeding. Recently, the province has generally received another 50 to 100 millimeters of rainfall, providing ample water for the growth of early rice, and a bumper harvest is expected in another 50 days.

　　江西早稻普遍生长良好
    江西省一千六百多万亩早稻普遍生长良好。南昌、上饶、抚州、吉安四个专区的早稻已长到六七寸高，禾叶青葱肥壮，已开始分蘖。赣南插秧较早地区的禾苗已长到一尺五寸多高，有的已封行。目前，各地农民正积极耘禾追肥。赣南地区的早稻已下了两次追肥，农民现正开始耘第二遍草。龙南县各农业生产合作社、互助组平均每亩田下了十三担多追肥。南昌、上饶、抚州、吉安等专区的早稻已耘完第一遍草。最近，全省又普降了五十到一百公厘左右的雨量，使早稻生长有了充沛的水量，再过五十天就可望丰收。　　　　　（本报驻南昌记者）
