　　Youth Savings Team on the Jining-Erlian Railway Line
    Recently, the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways commended a youth savings team active on the Jining-Erlian Railway line. This youth savings team was formed in April by more than forty young and middle-aged workers who built sheds and some veteran workers. In less than a month after the establishment of the savings team, they collected 182 jin of nails, spikes, and other materials from scrap heaps during their spare time. In mid-April, they accepted the task of building sheds and kitchens. On the work order form issued by the leading organization, it stated that 70 kilograms of nails should be領, but they only領ed 8 kilograms, and the rest were replaced with nails they had collected. They also tried using a substitute to replace expensive lumber and came up with a way to ensure quality. In this way, the material cost of each shed could be saved by 72 yuan. The team members studied the issue of saving every week. In late April, they discovered unreasonable labor organization and implemented an assembly line construction method. As a result, the time to build a shed was shortened from 18 workdays to 8 workdays. In April, they not only made rapid progress in the project, but also saved the state 454 yuan in wages.

　　集二线上的青年节约队
    最近铁道部第三工程局表扬了一个活跃在集二线上的青年节约队。这个青年节约队是在四月份由四十多个搭盖工棚的青、壮年工人和一些老工人组成的。节约队成立后不到一个月，他们利用业余时间从废料堆上拣回的钉子、道钉等有一百八十二斤。四月中旬，他们接受了盖工棚和伙房的任务，在领导机关发下的工作命令单上填着应领钉子七十公斤，他们只领了八公斤，其余的都用拣来的钉子代替了。他们还试用了一种代用品代替贵重的木料，并且想出保证质量的办法，这样，使每幢工棚的材料费可以节约七十二元。队员们每星期都要研究一次节约的问题。四月下旬，他们发现了劳动组织不合理的情况，便实行了流水作业的施工方法，结果把盖一个工棚的时间由十八个工日缩短到八个工日。四月份他们不但使工程迅速进展，还给国家节省了工资四百五十四元。　（新华社）
