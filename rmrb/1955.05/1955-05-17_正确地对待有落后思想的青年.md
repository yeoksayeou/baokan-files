Correctly Treat Young People with Backward Ideas
Yu Ming

    In ordinary times, it's easy for everyone to persist in using methods of persuasion and education to deal with young people with backward ideas. But when a movement comes, some people find it difficult to persist in using methods of persuasion and education to deal with young people with backward ideas.

    Currently, various regions are further strengthening communist moral education for young people. In carrying out this educational work, some people have developed feelings of annoyance and impatience towards young people with backward ideas, believing that using a comrade's attitude and methods of persuasion and education is ineffective, and that only using methods of struggle will work. The reason is: the ideological knots of these young people are tied too tightly, and cannot be blown away or broken through without strong winds and waves.

    This is an impetuous approach. This method is not beneficial for solving the ideological problems of young people. Regarding the issue of how to treat backward people, Comrade Mao Zedong taught us this way:

  “The attitude of Communists towards backward people is not to despise them, look down on them, but to be close to them, unite them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward.” He also said: “The attitude of Communists towards people who have made mistakes in their work, except for those who are beyond redemption, is not to adopt an attitude of rejection, but to adopt an attitude of persuasion to make them turn over a new leaf, abandon the old and start anew.” ("The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War")

    At present, some young people have some abnormal phenomena due to the influence of bourgeois ideology, or due to the influence of the old society's ideas and habits; but because they are still young, this influence is not very deep. As long as they can be treated with a comrade's attitude, sincerely united and helped, they can abandon the old and start anew, and transform for the better.

    Solving people's ideological problems is a patient and meticulous work. Here, specific analysis should be used more, and arbitrary actions should be avoided as much as possible. To judge whether a young person's thinking is backward, political principles should be the main standard, and personal feelings of love and hate should not be mixed in, let alone using some details of lifestyle habits that have little relationship with political and organizational principles as the standard. The advantages and disadvantages of young people with backward ideas should also be viewed comprehensively. Do not think that they have no redeeming qualities. In fact, although they have more shortcomings, they also have advantages. As long as they can be guided skillfully, these advantages can be gradually developed and become the strength for them to overcome backward aspects, and become the fuse for their progress.

    The reason why some young people have backward ideas is closely related to the fact that our work is not done well enough, or that there are shortcomings in our working methods. Therefore, the reasons for the shortcomings, mistakes, and incorrect ideas of young people must be distinguished, and it must be pointed out which problems should be the responsibility of the individual, and which problems should not be entirely their responsibility. If the nature and responsibility of the problem are not clearly distinguished, and they are only blamed unilaterally, they will not only not easily accept it, but also will not be convinced. If you only want to use the simple method of great storms to "rectify" them, or use an arrogant attitude of self-proclaimed advanced people to reprimand them, it will only strain the relationship and fail to achieve the purpose of uniting and educating young people.

### 正确地对待有落后思想的青年

　　正确地对待有落后思想的青年
　　愚明
    在平常时候，用说服教育的方法对待有落后思想的青年，大家容易坚持；在运动到来的时候，用说服教育的方法对待有落后思想的青年，有人就不大容易坚持。
    现在，各地正在进一步加强对青年的共产主义道德教育。在进行这项教育工作中，有人对于有落后思想的青年，就产生了厌烦急躁情绪，认为用同志的态度和说服教育的方法不顶事，只有用斗争方式才顶事。理由是：这些青年的思想疙瘩挽得太结实，不用大风大浪的方法吹不动，冲不开。
    这是操切从事的方法。这种方法对于解决青年的思想问题没有什么好处。如何对待落后人们的问题，毛泽东同志是这样教导我们的，他说：
  “共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”又说：“共产党员对于在工作中犯过错误的人们，除了不可救药者外，不是采取排斥态度，而是采取规劝态度，使之翻然改进，弃旧图新。”（“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”）
    目前，有些青年由于受资产阶级思想的影响，或是由于受旧社会的思想和习惯的影响，产生了一些不够正常的现象；但由于他们还年轻，这种影响并不是很深的。只要能以同志的态度对待他们，真心诚意地团结他们和帮助他们，他们是可以弃旧图新，转变好的。
    解决人们的思想问题，是一个耐心的细致的工作，在这里要多来具体分析，力戒任意逞性。判断一个青年的思想是否落后，要以政治原则为主要标准，而不要把个人的爱憎的感情夹杂在里面，更不要把一些同政治原则、组织原则无大关系的生活习惯上的细节问题作为标准。对于有落后思想的青年的优点和缺点也要全面地来看。不要认为他们身上无一是处。事实上，他们身上虽然缺点比较多一些，但他们也有优点的。只要能够善于诱导，这些优点就可以逐渐发扬起来，成为他们克服落后方面的力量，成为他们前进的引线。
    部分青年之所以有落后思想，同我们的工作做得不够，或者工作方式上有缺点，有着很大关系。因此，对于青年的缺点、错误和不正确思想产生的原因，必须分清责任，指出哪些问题是应该由他们个人来负责任的，哪些问题是不应该由他们来完全负责的。如果不把问题的性质和责任划分清楚，只去单方面责备他们，他们不但不容易接受，也不会心悦诚服的。如果只想用大风大浪的简单方式去“整”他们，或者以先进者自居的傲慢态度去训斥他们，那就更会把关系闹僵，达不到团结教育青年的目的了。
