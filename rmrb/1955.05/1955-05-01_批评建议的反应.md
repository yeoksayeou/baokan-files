Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

Leadership Organ of Hunan Military Region
　　Seriously Deals with Sun Ce's Mistakes
To the esteemed editors:
　　After the People's Daily published the letter of criticism, "Sun Ce's Erroneous Stance Towards Rich Peasant Families," on March 13th, in addition to continuously giving him criticism and education as we had done in the past, we also held a special discussion on Sun Ce's issue at the Standing Committee of the Military Region Party Committee on March 19th, severely criticizing and deeply analyzing his errors. In early April, we also launched a struggle against Sun Ce's rich peasant stance within the Political Department's Party Branch. First, after four days of deliberation in each group, we provided much specific assistance to Sun Ce's further self-criticism. Then, we held a branch general meeting for eleven hours over two days, and absorbed key members from the Party branches of units directly under the Military Region to participate, conducting a sharp struggle against Sun Ce's rich peasant stance.

　　In addition to the facts already exposed in the newspaper, that Sun Ce stood on the rich peasant's position to safeguard the interests of rich peasants, flaunted his authority before the masses, and attempted to force township cadres to provide evidence to change his rich peasant family status, we also discovered that he had personally and instructed a communications soldier to fire several shots during his return home. Upon returning to the unit, he brought the rich peasant Sun Bangshan (his elder brother) to the army, wearing a military uniform to impersonate a soldier and steal the half-price preferential treatment afforded to soldiers, and wrapped his nephew, who should have bought a ticket, in a quilt to evade purchasing a ticket as required by regulations. After the errors were exposed, Sun Ce's attitude was still not honest. He privately wrote letters to the communications soldier who went home with him, attempting to fabricate false evidence and play tricks on the organization. Until the branch general meeting, he was still unable to humbly and sincerely accept criticism and face his own errors squarely. Although he later admitted the rich peasant status of his family and the seriousness of his errors after repeated education and assistance from leading comrades and the branch, we believe that the nature of his errors is serious. In order to educate Sun Ce himself and everyone, with the approval of the higher-level Party committee and the Military Region, it was decided to give Sun Ce a disciplinary measure of being placed on probation within the Party for one year, and an administrative demotion.

Sun Ce's Self-Criticism
To the esteemed editors:

　　The exposé material by Comrade Yu Longyue and others from He County, Anhui, published in the People's Daily on March 13th is completely true. My family's status was classified as rich peasant during the land reform, and the review after the land reform did not change it, which proves that the rich peasant status was not wrongly classified. I am a Communist Party member, and I should firmly stand on the Party's position, draw a clear line between myself and the rich peasant family ideologically, and give serious criticism and restraint to the reactionary fallacy of so-called "over-classification of status" (which is actually resistance to transformation) yelled by rich peasant families, and educate the family to earnestly abide by the government's policies and laws and accept socialist transformation. I should not have listened to the family's words with bias, stood on the rich peasant family's position, illegally convened a residents' meeting to attempt to change the status, and should not have treated the township cadres with a bad attitude at the township government meeting in an attempt to change the status. This error is indeed extremely serious.

　　The occurrence of this error after studying the General Line makes its nature even more serious. This error not only reflects that I have lost my proletarian stance, but its essence is an anti-Party behavior. During the current period of socialist transformation in our country, some bourgeois elements will inevitably adopt various methods to launch attacks on our Party in order to resist socialist transformation. My rich peasant family used flesh-and-blood affection to deceive me. Because my class stance was blurred, I was captured by rich peasant ideology and became a spokesperson for the rich peasant class. This erroneous behavior will inevitably fuel the reactionary arrogance of the local rich peasant class and increase the difficulty of the Party's socialist transformation of the rich peasant class.

　　The root cause of this error is mainly due to the fact that my ideology has not been well transformed. In recent years, I have been constantly eroded by rich peasant ideology, especially after the victory of the revolution, the ideas of meritorious service and bourgeois privilege have grown, and I have ideologically regarded the masses as "Adou" and myself as the "boss" of the masses, which has also contributed to the seriousness of this error.

　　In order to recover the extremely bad influence caused by my error and to educate myself, in addition to making self-criticism in the People's Daily and to the cadres of Xinsheng Township in He County, I am also willing to accept any disciplinary action given to me by the organization. In future revolutionary practice, I will unswervingly stand on the proletarian position, draw a clear line with bourgeois ideology, and educate my family with a serious attitude to abide by the government's policies and laws, work hard, and honestly accept socialist transformation, and be a working person.

专栏：批评建议的反应

　　批评建议的反应
　　湖南军区领导机关
　  严肃处理孙策的错误编辑同志：
    人民日报在三月十三日发表了“孙策对待富农家庭的错误立场”的批评信以后，我们除了过去已不断给他以批评教育以外，又在三月十九日召开的军区党委会的常委会上，把孙策问题作了专题讨论，对他的错误进行了严厉的批评和深刻的分析。四月初又在政治部党支部内展开了反对孙策富农立场的斗争，首先在各小组经过四天时间的酝酿，对孙策的进一步检讨又作了许多具体的帮助，然后在两天内以十一小时的时间召开了支部大会，并吸收军区直属单位各党支部骨干分子参加，进行了反对孙策富农立场的尖锐斗争。
    孙策的错误除了报纸已揭发的站在富农立场维护富农利益，向群众摆威风，企图迫使乡干部作证明给他改变富农家庭成份的事实外，我们还发现了他在回家期间曾亲自和指使通讯员鸣枪数发，归队时又将富农孙邦山（他的哥哥）带来部队，身着军服冒充军人窃取军人的半票优待，将他应当买票的侄儿用棉被包上，逃避按章买票等行为。在错误被揭发以后，孙策的态度还不老实，私自给随他回家的通讯员写信企图造假证明，向组织上耍手段。直到召开支部大会前还不能虚心诚恳地接受批评，正视自己的错误。后来虽经领导同志及支部的反复教育帮助，承认了自己家庭的富农成份及错误的严重性，但我们认为其错误的性质是严重的，为了教育孙策本人及大家，经呈请上级党委和军区的批准，决定在党内给予孙策以留党察看一年的处分，行政上给予降职处分。中国共产党湖南军区委员会中国人民解放军湖南军区政治部
    孙策的检讨编辑同志：
    三月十三日人民日报刊载安徽和县余龙月同志等对我的检举材料完全属实。我家庭成份在土改时划为富农，土改后复查又未改变，这就证明了富农成份并没有划错。我是一个共产党员，应该坚定地站在党的立场，从思想上和富农家庭划清界限，对富农家庭叫喊所谓“成份划高了”的反动论调（实际上是抵抗改造）应该给以严肃的批判和制止，教育家庭切实遵守政府政策法令接受社会主义改造，而不应该偏听偏信家庭的话，站在富农家庭立场，非法地召开居民会企图改变成份，更不应该在乡政府会上，为企图改变成份，以恶劣的态度对待乡干部，这种错误确实是异常严重的。
    这种错误发生在学习总路线之后，其性质就更为严重。这种错误不仅反映了我丧失了无产阶级立场，其实质就是一种反党行为。在目前我国社会主义改造时期，某些资产阶级分子为了抵抗社会主义改造，必然采取各种方式向我党实行进攻，我的富农家庭就通过骨肉感情来蒙蔽我，由于我阶级立场模糊，结果做了富农思想的俘虏，成了富农阶级的代言人。这种错误行为，必然助长了当地富农阶级的反动气焰，增加了党对富农阶级进行社会主义改造的困难。
    这种错误根源主要是由于我的思想没有得到很好改造，几年来、我在富农思想的不断腐蚀下，尤其在革命胜利后，居功自傲和资产阶级的特权思想有了滋长，在思想上把群众看成“阿斗”，把自己看成群众“上司”，因而也助长了此次错误的严重性。
    为了挽回由于我的错误所造成的极坏影响和教育我本人，除在人民日报及向和县新生乡干部作检讨外，并愿意接受组织上给予我的任何纪律处分。在今后革命实践中，我要坚定不移地站在无产阶级立场，和资产阶级思想划清界限，并以严肃的态度教育家庭很好遵守政府的政策法令，努力劳动，老老实实的接受社会主义改造，做一个劳动人民。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　孙策
