    Further Consolidate and Develop China's Economic Cooperation with the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
　　Li Zheren, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China
    In the process of restoring the national economy and carrying out the great socialist construction, the Chinese people are not isolated and helpless. After the Chinese people achieved victory in the people's democratic revolution and established the People's Republic of China, our country immediately became a member of the socialist peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and participated in economic cooperation within this international family. China's economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries has been consolidated and developed year by year on the basis of brotherly friendship, mutual assistance, and the planned development of national economies. It has strongly promoted the rapid recovery and development of China's national economy and severely undermined the "embargo" policy of American imperialism. Therefore, it has become one of the reliable guarantees for China to successfully carry out large-scale socialist economic construction.
    The level of economic development of the countries in the socialist camp varies. The Soviet Union, which is carrying out communist construction, is the most advanced in the world in terms of both economic development and scientific and technological achievements; however, China's economic and technological foundation is quite backward, and it has just begun to implement national socialist industrialization. The level of economic development of other fraternal countries is also not entirely the same. However, the different levels of economic development do not affect our economic cooperation, because we are all striving forward under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism for the lofty goal of eliminating the system of human exploitation and building a beautiful and happy socialist and communist society. The basis of our economic cooperation is the sincere desire to help each other and seek common economic prosperity. Different levels of economic development are increasingly promoting our economic cooperation in order to complement each other's advantages. The great Soviet Union has consistently provided comprehensive, enormous, and selfless assistance to China and other People's Democratic countries. Economic mutual assistance and cooperation among the People's Democratic countries play a significant role in the economic development of each country. This sincere assistance and fraternal economic relations of equality and mutual benefit embody the new type of international relations established by the socialist camp countries. This relationship of economic cooperation is fundamentally different from the economic relations between capitalist countries. As everyone knows, the economic relations between countries in the capitalist world are as follows: American imperialists use various means to intrude and control the economies of other capitalist countries, and imperialist countries are desperately engaged in the struggle to seize raw material producing areas and monopolize sales markets. Imperialist countries cruelly enslave and plunder the people of colonies and backward countries.
    China's economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is mainly realized through foreign trade. China's trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is developing steadily and in a planned manner, along with the continuous economic upsurge of the entire socialist camp, and according to the needs and possibilities of both parties. In 1954, China's trade volume with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries was more than four times that of 1950. In 1954, China's trade volume with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries accounted for 80 percent of China's total foreign trade volume. Over the years, we have obtained from the Soviet Union many complete sets of factory equipment and various excellent machine tools, mining, transportation, and construction machinery, various hardware and steel products, rare metals, ferroalloys, telecommunications and electrical equipment, precision instruments, medical equipment, petroleum, chemical raw materials, as well as supplies of cotton, sugar, and other materials; we have also obtained from European People's Democratic countries various machine tools, power machines, drilling machines, cranes, tractors, construction machinery, vehicles, petroleum, hardware and steel products, chemical raw materials, precision instruments, medicines, and other materials and complete sets of equipment; we have obtained from Asian People's Democratic countries supplies of livestock, food, chemical raw materials and products, and other materials. In the past few years, capital goods accounted for the vast majority of the materials imported by China from the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, accounting for 93.5 percent in 1954; among the goods imported from the Soviet Union, capital goods accounted for approximately 97 percent. Most of these materials are so-called "embargoed" materials by American imperialism. This shows that no matter how American imperialism imposes "embargoes," it can never stop the rapid development of China's industrial construction.
    In China's trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the supply of complete sets of equipment is of great significance to China's industrialization. Only the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries can supply China with these technically sophisticated and complete sets of equipment. Taking 1952 as 100, China's imports of complete sets of equipment were 166.63 in 1953 and 346.46 in 1954. As everyone knows, the main equipment required for the 156 enterprises that are the core of China's first Five-Year Plan construction is all supplied by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union also provides assistance from beginning to end, from selecting factory sites, conducting design, guiding installation, training personnel, until the production of new products. China has also obtained dozens of sets of equipment from European People's Democratic countries, including power stations, chemical, telecommunications, and sugar-making equipment.
    China also supplies the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries with various mineral products, animal products, grains, oils, non-staple foods, and world-famous tea, silk, bristles, tung oil, and handicrafts. These materials have played and are playing a significant role in meeting the needs of production and construction in fraternal countries and improving people's lives.
    Our commodity exchanges are realized under the requirements of adapting to the plans for developing the national economies of both parties, based on the needs and possibilities of both parties, and through friendly consultation and mutual consideration. Here, there are no unreasonable phenomena such as deceit and fraud, dumping of surplus products, and forcing the other party to accept goods they do not need, as are commonly seen in the capitalist market.
    China's trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries also adopts a set of simple and effective organizations and technologies that embody the principle of equality and mutual benefit, based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The commodities exchanged by both parties are priced according to fair and reasonable pricing principles agreed upon by both parties. Once the price is determined, it basically remains unchanged, and only individual varieties are subject to necessary reciprocal adjustments each year. We use the ruble as the common standard for pricing, which is the most stable and solid currency in the world. This pricing method not only facilitates the annual negotiations of huge import and export commodities between the two parties, enabling them to be completed smoothly in a short period of time, but also enables our foreign trade to avoid the impact of price fluctuations in the capitalist market. In the past five years, under the manipulation of American imperialism, prices in the capitalist world market have soared and plummeted several times; however, the prices of China's trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have always been stable, which has played a considerable role in ensuring the smooth progress of China's economic construction. Our commodity exchanges are balanced between both parties, so there is no problem of payment difficulties. According to the provisions of the common conditions for delivery and payment of goods, after the goods are loaded and paid, the funds can be immediately obtained from the domestic bank through the method of bookkeeping and settlement, which is simple in procedure and rapid in turnover. For orders with a long production and manufacturing process, even taking two or three years, no deposit is required, but rather included in the current year's balance and paid upon delivery. These methods greatly facilitate the development of mutual trade.
    China's economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is also reflected in the rapid development of scientific and technological cooperation. The main methods of this cooperation are mutual supply of scientific and technological information, technical drawings, exchange of technical experience, and mutual dispatch of experts and interns. This has a great effect on promoting the improvement of each other's technical level and the economic upsurge. In the past few years, the Soviet Union has provided China with a large amount of the most advanced technical information and drawings free of charge, and we have only paid for the cost of copying various materials. Relying on the technical information and drawings supplied by the Soviet Union and the assistance of a large number of Soviet experts, we have begun to produce many new and important machine tools, mining machinery, construction machinery, vehicles, ships, and some power generation equipment. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement in 1954 marked a new stage in the technological cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, creating more favorable conditions for the more comprehensive and systematic development of scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries. By the end of March 1955, China had signed scientific and technological cooperation agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and other countries. The technical projects supplied to China by the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe mainly include various heavy-duty precision machine tools, various types of boilers, steam turbines, diesel engines, 2,500-ton steam-hydraulic presses, electric furnace alloy steel, water source exploration drilling equipment, salvage of sunken ships, coal mining machinery, refrigeration plants, and other technical information and drawings, and experts have been dispatched to provide specific assistance. The technical projects supplied by China to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries mainly include: production methods for ink, porcelain, canned food, food, fountain pens, silk weaving, sericulture, etc., planting methods for soybeans, rice, tobacco, ramie, etc., and exchange of seeds of certain crops. In addition, according to the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement in November 1953, China has dispatched some technicians and engineers to assist in the work of certain factories and mining enterprises in Korea, and has accepted many Korean production technicians to come to China for internships. China has also provided some technical assistance to the Mongolian People's Republic and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam within its capabilities. China's scientific and technological cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries will undoubtedly develop more widely and comprehensively in the future, helping each other to rapidly improve the level of production technology to the best of their ability. It should be particularly mentioned here that the Soviet Union is providing China with scientific, technological, and industrial assistance in promoting the research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. This assistance plays a huge promoting role in China's industrial development and the improvement of scientific and technological levels, and has made a major contribution to further consolidating the friendly cooperation between the two sides. This is completely in line with the interests of China and the Soviet Union and the interests of consolidating world peace.
    Joint ventures also play a significant role in China's economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and in the development of China's economy. The four joint-stock companies established by China and the Soviet Union in 1950 and 1951, namely the Sino-Soviet Nonferous and Rare Metals Company, the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company, the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company, and Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation, transferred their Soviet shares to China at the end of last year according to the communique of the Sino-Soviet talks in October 1954, becoming state-owned enterprises solely operated by China. The Soviet government helped us establish urgently needed enterprises on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and equal equity during the difficult years of China's economic recovery, promoted the recovery and development of China's industry, and cultivated many talents, taught advanced production technology and management experience, and then completely transferred the enterprises to us. This generous and selfless help has left an indelible glorious page in the history of Sino-Soviet economic cooperation.
    China's equal, mutually beneficial, friendly, and mutually supportive economic cooperation with fraternal countries is also reflected in the provision of loan assistance. According to the agreement on granting loans to the People's Republic of China signed on February 14, 1950, the Soviet Union lent China 1.2 billion rubles at preferential interest rates; in October 1954, an agreement on the Soviet government granting the Chinese government a long-term loan of 520 million rubles was also signed. These loans are used for the supply of industrial equipment and means of production, which is of great significance to accelerating China's industrialization. In addition, the Chinese government decided to donate 800 million yuan to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea free of charge within four years from 1954 to 1957 to help Korea restore its national economy. In December 1954, China also signed a long-term loan agreement with the People's Republic of Albania. We firmly believe that the various support from fraternal countries will surely enable all countries to achieve common economic upsurge and contribute to the common cause. Every achievement of the Korean people and the Albanian people is an achievement of the entire socialist camp.
    In addition, the mutual holding of economic exhibitions between China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries also promotes our economic cooperation. The Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition held in Beijing and Shanghai last October and March, as well as the economic exhibitions held in China by other fraternal countries, not only greatly encouraged the Chinese people's victorious confidence in building socialism, but also gave China great help in imparting advanced technology and introducing the experience of socialist construction.
    China's close economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries fully embodies the spirit of proletarian internationalism between us and the unbreakable brotherly profound friendship. The achievements that China's construction cause has obtained are inseparable from the comprehensive, enormous, and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, and are also inseparable from the enthusiastic support of the People's Democratic countries. We are firmly and unswervingly further consolidating and developing the economic cooperation of our socialist peace and democracy camp in order to achieve further common economic upsurge in our respective economies and strengthen our brotherly friendship. At the same time, we also advocate widely developing economic and trade relations with any other country—regardless of the difference in its social system—on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, in order to meet each other's economic needs, enhance mutual understanding and friendly relations, and strengthen the cause of maintaining world peace.

    进一步巩固和发展我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的经济合作
　　中华人民共和国对外贸易部副部长　李哲人
    中国人民在恢复国民经济和进行伟大的社会主义建设的过程中，不是孤立无助的。当中国人民取得了人民民主革命的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国以后，我国立即成为以苏联为首的社会主义和平民主阵营的成员之一，并参加了这个国际大家庭里的经济合作。我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的经济合作，在兄弟般的友好互助和各国经济有计划发展的基础上，一年比一年巩固和发展起来，有力地促进了我国国民经济的迅速恢复和发展，严重地打击了美帝国主义的“禁运”政策，因而成为我国胜利地进行大规模的社会主义经济建设的可靠保证之一。
    社会主义阵营各国的经济发展水平是各不相同的。正在进行共产主义建设的苏联，无论就经济发展水平或科学技术的造诣来说，都是世界上最先进的；而我国经济和技术的基础，却相当落后，刚刚开始实行国家的社会主义工业化。其他各个兄弟国家，经济发展的水平也不完全一样。但是经济发展水平的不同，并不影响我们之间的经济合作，因为我们大家都是在马克思列宁主义指导下，共同为消灭人剥削人的社会制度，建成美好幸福的社会主义和共产主义社会的崇高目的而奋斗迈进着。我们之间的经济合作的基础是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。不同的经济发展水平，正在日益促进我们之间的经济合作，以便互通有无、取长补短。伟大的苏联对我国和其它各人民民主国家一贯地给予全面的巨大的无私的帮助。各人民民主国家间经济上的互助合作，对各国经济的发展，有着重大的作用。这种真诚的援助和平等互利的兄弟般的经济关系，体现出社会主义阵营国家所建立的新型的国际关系。这种经济合作的关系，和资本主义各国间的经济关系有原则上的区别。大家知道，资本主义世界各国之间的经济关系是：美帝国主义者通过种种方式对其他资本主义国家的经济实行侵入和控制，帝国主义国家间拚命地进行着争夺原料产地、垄断销售市场的斗争，帝国主义国家对殖民地、落后国家人民实行残酷的奴役和掠夺。
    我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的经济合作，主要是通过对外贸易来实现的。我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易，随着整个社会主义阵营经济的不断高涨，并根据双方的需要与可能，正在有计划地稳步地发展着。一九五四年我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易额为一九五○年的四倍多。一九五四年我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易额占我国全部对外贸易额百分之八十。历年来我们从苏联获得很多成套的工厂设备和各种最优良的工作母机，矿山、运输、建筑机械，各种五金钢材，稀有金属，铁合金，电讯电工器材，精密仪器、医疗器材、石油、化工原料，以及棉花、糖等物资的供应；从欧洲人民民主国家也获得了各种工作母机、动力机、钻探机、起重机、拖拉机、建筑机械、车辆、石油、五金钢材、化工原料、精密仪器、医药等物资和成套设备的供应；从亚洲人民民主国家获得了牲畜、食品、化学原料和产品等物资的供应。几年来，在我国从苏联和各人民民主国家进口的物资中，生产资料占绝大比重，一九五四年度为百分之九十三点五；其中从苏联进口的货物中，生产资料约占百分之九十七。这些物资，极大部分都是美帝国主义的所谓“禁运”物资。这说明不论美帝国主义怎样“禁运”，它是永远不能阻挡住我国工业建设迅速发展的。
    在我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易中，成套设备的供应对我国工业化有着非常重要的意义。也只有苏联和各人民民主国家才能供应我国这些技术精湛的、完整的成套设备。我国进口的成套设备，如以一九五二年为一○○，一九五三年则为一六六点六三，一九五四年为三四六点四六。大家知道，作为我国第一个五年计划建设核心的一五六项企业所需的主要设备全是苏联供应的。苏联并且从选择厂址、进行设计、指导安装、训练人员，直到制成新产品，自始至终给以帮助。我国从欧洲各人民民主国家也获得了数十项成套设备的供应，其中包括电站、化学、电讯、制糖等设备。
    我国对苏联和各人民民主国家，也供应了各种矿产品、畜产品、粮食、油脂、副食品和世界著名的茶叶、丝绸、猪鬃、桐油、手工艺品，这些物资对于供应各兄弟国家生产建设的需要和改善人民的生活，也起了和起着重大的作用。
    我们之间的商品交换，是在适应双方发展国民经济计划的要求下，根据双方需要与可能，在友好协商和彼此照顾的基础上实现的。在这里，完全没有像在资本主义市场所常见的尔虞我诈、倾销剩余产品、强使对方接受他所不需要的商品的不合理现象。
    我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易，还根据苏联先进经验，采取了一套体现平等互利原则的、简便有效的组织与技术。双方交换的商品，都是按照经过双方商定的公平合理的作价原则来计价的。价格确定后基本上不再变动，只是每年对个别品种，相互进行必要的对等的调整。我们之间都是用卢布作为计价的共同标准，这是世界上最稳定和最巩固的货币。这样的作价办法，不但便利了每年双方巨额的进出口商品谈判，使其能在短期内顺利完成，而且能使我们的对外贸易避免资本主义市场价格波动的影响。近五年来，在美帝国主义的操纵下，资本主义世界市场价格已经几度暴涨暴落；但是我国同苏联和各人民民主国家贸易的价格却一直是稳定的，这对保证我国经济建设的顺利进行有相当大的作用。我们之间的商品交换都是双方平衡的，因而不存在支付困难的问题。双方的货物按照交货付款共同条件的规定，装货付款之后，就可通过记账结汇办法，立即自本国银行取得货款，手续简便，周转迅速。对于生产制造过程很长的，甚至要二年或三年时间的订货，都不需预付定金，而是列入当年平衡，至交货时付款。这些办法大大便利了相互间贸易的发展。
    我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的经济合作关系还表现在科学、技术合作的迅速发展。这一合作的方式主要是相互供给科学技术资料、技术图纸，交流技术经验，并互相派遣专家和实习人员，这对促进彼此技术水平的提高和经济的高涨都有很大作用。过去几年来，苏联无偿地供给了我国大量的最先进的技术资料和图纸，我们付出去的仅是复制各种资料的成本费用。我们依靠了苏联所供应的技术资料和图纸和大批苏联专家的帮助，已开始生产着许多新式的重要的工作母机、矿山机械、建筑机械、车辆、船舶和若干发电设备等。一九五四年中苏科学技术合作协定的签订，标志着中苏两国的技术合作的新阶段，为两国科学与技术合作更全面、更系统地发展创造了更加有利的条件。到一九五五年三月底止，我国已与波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚等国先后签订了科学技术合作协定。东欧各人民民主国家供给我国的技术项目主要有各种重型的精密的工作母机、各型锅炉、汽轮机、柴油机、二千五百吨蒸汽水压机，电炉合金钢、水源勘察钻探设备、打捞沉船、煤矿机械、冷冻工厂等技术资料和图纸，并派遣了专家进行具体帮助。我国供应苏联和各人民民主国家的技术项目，主要是：制墨、磁器、罐头、食物、自来水笔、绢纺织造、养蚕等生产方法，大豆、大米、烟草、苎麻等种植方法和交换若干农作物的种籽。此外，根据中朝一九五三年十一月经济及文化合作协定，我国已派遣一些技工和技师去朝鲜某些厂矿企业内协助工作，并接受了不少朝鲜生产技术人员来我国实习。对蒙古人民共和国和越南民主共和国，我国也在可能范围内提供了一些技术援助。我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的科学与技术合作，今后无疑地将会更广泛地全面地发展起来，各尽所能地互相帮助对方迅速提高生产技术水平。这里，应该特别提出的，是苏联在促进原子能和平用途的研究方面给予我国科学、技术和工业上的帮助。这种帮助对我国工业发展和科学技术水平的提高起着巨大的推进作用，对进一步巩固双方友好合作作出了重大贡献，这是完全符合中苏两国利益和巩固世界和平的利益的。
    合营企业，在我国和苏联的经济合作中，在发展我国经济中，亦起着重大的作用。中苏在一九五○年和一九五一年合办的四个股份公司，即中苏有色及稀有金属公司，中苏石油公司，中苏造船公司和中苏民用航空公司，已根据一九五四年十月中苏会谈的公报在去年底将其中的苏联股份移交我国，成为我国独营的国营企业。苏联政府在我国恢复经济的艰难岁月中，在平等互利和同等股权的基础上帮助我们将迫切需要的企业创办起来，促进了我国工业的恢复和发展，并培养了许多人材，传授了先进的生产技术和管理经验，然后把企业完全移交给我们。这种慷慨无私的帮助，在中苏经济合作的历史上留下了永不磨灭的光辉一页。
    我国同兄弟国家平等互利友好互助的经济合作，还表现在给予贷款援助方面。根据在一九五○年二月十四日签订的关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定，苏联以优惠的利息贷给了我国十二亿卢布的贷款；一九五四年十月又签订了关于苏联政府给予我国政府五亿二千万卢布的长期贷款协定。这些贷款，是用于工业装备和生产资料的供应上的，对加速我国的工业化有很大意义。此外，我国政府决定在一九五四年至一九五七年四年内无偿地赠送给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府八亿元，作为帮助朝鲜恢复国民经济之用。一九五四年十二月，我国同阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国也签订了长期贷款协定。我们深信：兄弟国家间的各种支援，一定能使各国得到共同的经济高涨和有助于共同的事业，朝鲜人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民的每一个成就都是整个社会主义阵营的成就。
    此外，我国同苏联和各人民民主国家相互举办经济展览会，也促进我们之间的经济合作。去年十月和今年三月先后在北京、上海举办的苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会，以及其他兄弟国家在我国举行的经济展览会，不仅大大鼓舞了我国人民建设社会主义的胜利信心，而且在传授先进技术、介绍社会主义建设经验上，都给了我国以很大帮助。
    我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的亲密的经济合作，充分体现了我们之间的无产阶级国际主义精神和牢不可破的兄弟般的深厚友谊。我国建设事业已获得的成就，同苏联的全面的巨大的无私的援助是分不开的，同各人民民主国家的热情支援也是分不开的。我们正在坚定不移地进一步巩固和发展我们社会主义和平民主阵营的经济合作，以求得各自经济的进一步的共同高涨，并加强我们之间的兄弟般的友谊。同时，我们也主张同任何其他国家——不论它的社会制度的不同——在平等互利的基础上广泛地发展经济和贸易关系，以适应彼此经济上的需要，增进相互了解和友好关系，加强维护世界和平的事业。
