　　Ten Years of Democratic Construction
　　Hermann Matern, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany
    Ten years ago, on May 8, 1945, the heroic Soviet army gloriously defeated Hitler's Germany, liberating the people of Europe—including the German people—from the fascist plague. The German people thereby gained the possibility of beginning a truly democratic new life leading to happiness and prosperity.
    Although the Western imperialist countries agreed to the Soviet proposals for the democratization of Germany—proposals reflected in the Potsdam Agreement—only the Soviet occupation zone of Germany at that time conformed to this spirit, and the work of eliminating fascism and militarism was developed there.
    Relying on the experience and assistance of the Soviet Union, the anti-fascist democratic forces carried out a thorough transformation of economic and political life in East Germany.
    The property of monopoly capitalists and Junkers was expropriated, thereby eliminating the basis for imperialism to launch new wars. Through democratic reforms and land reform, the Junkers and large landowners' 2,981,999 hectares of land were distributed to 559,089 working farmers, farm laborers, and immigrants, thereby eradicating the most rampant source of Prussian-German militarism.
    At the same time, land reform laid a solid foundation for the establishment of a worker-peasant alliance, promoting extensive democratic reforms in the long-backward rural areas.
    The educational privileges of the past ruling classes were abolished, and through democratic reform of education, the children of the working class and other working people had every possibility of mastering rich knowledge in all aspects of life.
    These initial reforms and democratic measures laid the cornerstone for the democratic development of Germany and for the construction of the socialist foundation now underway in the German Democratic Republic.
    The working class under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany played a leading role in realizing these initial measures and reforms, which are of great significance for the future of Germany.
    The development in West Germany is completely the opposite. There, the monopoly capitalists and large landowners have restored their anti-people rule. This confirms the historical truth that the working class can only achieve victory where it struggles unitedly and is led by a Marxist-Leninist fighting party.
    In the German Democratic Republic, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany vividly embodies this unity of the workers' movement established on the basis of Marxism-Leninism between Communists and Social Democrats.
    Conversely, in West Germany, the right-wing Social Democrats obstruct the establishment of working-class unity and are supported by Western imperialist countries.
    The Western imperialist countries undermined the Potsdam Agreement and caused the division of Germany.
    "The German Democratic Republic was born in the national struggle against the policy of division pursued by the Western occupying countries and the restoration of the forces of the old imperialism and militarism, and in the vigorous people's movement."
    The German Democratic Republic is a solid base for the German people to fight for the restoration of national unity on a democratic basis, for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and for the withdrawal of occupying forces.
    The German Democratic Republic is the first truly peace-loving and democratic German state. Since its establishment, the German Democratic Republic, a state ruled by workers and peasants, has pursued a policy of peace, a policy of restoring German unity, consolidating national power, and continuously improving the people's living standards.
    Relying on the assistance and experience of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, workers, peasants, and intellectuals have made achievements unprecedented in German history.
    In the first four years of the first Five-Year Plan (1951-1954), the total value of industrial production increased by 76 percent. Compared with 1936 (which was the period of the highest production in fascist Germany), output increased nearly twofold. During this period, in addition to the enormous economic destruction caused by Hitler's war, there were additional difficulties to overcome due to the division of Germany and the disintegration of the unified economy. For example, some enterprises in the basic means of production industry had to be completely rebuilt, and some needed to be greatly expanded on the basis of what already existed. Neither steel nor coal could be obtained from the Ruhr area. The main steel industry, coal mining industry and basic means of production industries are concentrated there.
    There are currently a total of 2,200 machine tractor stations and sub-stations in agriculture. There are a total of 5,120 agricultural production cooperatives, with cultivated land accounting for 14.83 percent of the total agricultural planting area.
    In 1954, 136 agricultural production cooperatives were already able to completely mechanize grain harvesting. Farmers' incomes increased by 552 million marks in 1954 alone.
    The improvement in the living standards of the working people is also reflected in the increase in commodity circulation. In 1954, retail sales increased by 14 percent compared with 1953. There have been a total of sixteen large-scale price reductions. Workers' real wages are constantly increasing.
    Great achievements have also been made in cultural, educational, health and social welfare undertakings. In 1950, there were only 20 universities, colleges, and independent colleges, but by 1954, the number had increased to 46. From 1951 to 1954, funding for culture and science nearly doubled.
    The German Democratic Republic currently has trade relations with 70 countries around the world. In 1954, it signed trade agreements with Argentina, India, Indonesia, Iceland, Turkey, Uruguay, and Yugoslavia for the first time. In 1954, the volume of trade with capitalist markets increased by 32 percent compared with 1953. Trade with countries in the democratic world market accounted for 75 percent of the total trade volume in 1954.
    The source of the German Democratic Republic's constantly growing welfare is the enthusiasm and selfless labor of the working people, first and foremost the enthusiasm and selfless labor of production innovators, activists and labor heroes, inventors and scientists.
    Mutual assistance and cooperation with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries is a great support for us.
    Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany—the inspirer and organizer of their great victories—the working people of the German Democratic Republic are determined to defend their achievements.
    The Bonn Parliament, which is subservient to the United States, ratified the Paris war agreement, which is a treasonous act by the Bonn war group. They are subjecting West Germany to the interests of the United States and German militarists, deepening the division of Germany, and threatening peace.
    The Paris Agreement was approved against the will of the majority of the German people. This vote was held in the face of protests and the most resolute opposition from the majority of the people—including the people of West Germany. The German working class and all patriotic Germans will never recognize this treasonous act by the Bonn government.
    Germany in 1955 is not Germany in 1932. All patriots in West Germany today have a reliable pillar; they receive strong support from the German Democratic Republic. Now it is necessary to greatly strengthen the national resistance to the American war and enslavement schemes, establish the unity of action of the entire German working class in the struggle against militarism and the Paris war agreement, and unite all patriotic forces. "Germans sit down at one table!" is the slogan of the struggle for unity and peace.
    The Soviet army liberated the people of all countries, especially the German people, from the fascist shackles ten years ago. A peace treaty with Germany has not yet been concluded, and fascist militarists are preparing for a new world war.
    The peace forces of the world, especially the people of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, will not tolerate such a devastating development. Therefore, the German people receive the sympathy and full support of the world peace camp in their just national struggle.
    The German Democratic Republic will always maintain friendly cooperation and fraternal assistance with the countries of the democratic camp. It hopes that this relationship will become closer and more consolidated in all aspects of science and technology, culture, exchange of experience and exchange of goods. We are fortunate to be closely united with the great People's Republic of China, fighting together in the global peace camp.
    The German Democratic Republic and the German people have many reasons to be grateful to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has always firmly defended the interests of the German people. The Soviet Union granted the German Democratic Republic full sovereignty, making the German Democratic Republic an equal member of the family of nations.
    The great People's Republic of China ended the state of war with Germany and supported our struggle for democratic unity. The best way for the German Democratic Republic and the German people to reciprocate these sincere friendships and deep trust is to defend and maintain world peace and to resolutely carry the struggle against the revival of West German militarism and for the reunification of Germany to a victorious conclusion.

　　民主建设十年
　　德国统一社会党中央政治局委员　赫尔曼·马特恩
    十年前，一九四五年五月八日，英勇的苏联军队光荣地战胜了希特勒德国，把欧洲各国人民——也包括德国人民在内——从法西斯瘟疫下解放了出来。德国人民从而获得了可能，开始一个通向幸福和繁荣的真正民主的新生活。
    虽然西方帝国主义国家同意了苏联提出的关于德国民主化的建议——这些建议反映在波茨坦协定中，但只有当时德国的苏占区才符合这个精神，在那里，消灭法西斯主义和军国主义的工作得到了发展。
    反法西斯民主力量依靠了苏联的经验和帮助，在东德进行了经济和政治生活的彻底改造。
    垄断资本家和容克地主的财产被剥夺了，从而消灭了帝国主义发动新战争的基础。通过民主改革和土地改革，把容克贵族和大地主的二百九十八万一千九百九十九公顷土地分给了五十五万九千零八十九名劳动农民、雇农和移民，从而就铲除了普鲁士德意志军国主义的最猖獗的策源地。
    土地改革同时为建立工农联盟奠定了坚固的基础，促进了一直还很落后的农村进行广泛的民主改革。
    过去统治阶级的教育特权被取消了，通过教育的民主改革，工人阶级和其他劳动人民的子女就有了掌握生活各方面丰富的知识的一切可能性。
    最初的这些改革和民主措施，为德国的民主发展，为现在正在德意志民主共和国进行的社会主义基础的建设奠定了基石。
    在德国统一社会党领导下的工人阶级，在实现这些对德国的未来具有十分重大意义的初步措施和改革时起了领导作用。
    西德的发展完全相反。在那里，垄断资本家和大地主又恢复了他们的反人民统治。这就证实了这条历史的真理：只有在工人阶级统一地进行斗争并由一个马克思列宁主义的战斗政党来领导的地方，工人阶级才能取得胜利。
    在德意志民主共和国，德国统一社会党生动地体现了共产党人和社会民主党人在马克思列宁主义基础上建立起来的工人运动的这种统一。
    相反地，在西德，右翼社会民主党阻挠工人阶级统一的建立，并得到西方帝国主义国家的支持。
    西方帝国主义国家破坏了波茨坦协定，造成了德国的分裂。
    “德意志民主共和国是在反对西方占领国家所推行的分裂和恢复旧的帝国主义和军国主义分子势力的政策的民族斗争中，在蓬勃的人民运动中诞生的。”
    德意志民主共和国是德国人民为争取在民主基础上恢复国家统一，争取缔结对德和约和撤退占领军而斗争的坚如磐石的基地。
    德意志民主共和国是第一个真正爱好和平的、民主的德意志国家。自从德意志民主共和国成立以来，这个工农执政的国家就执行着和平政策，执行着恢复德国统一，巩固国家权力和不断提高人民生活水平的政策。
    依靠着苏联和各人民民主国家的援助和经验，工人、农民和知识分子作出了在德国历史上前所未有的成绩。
    在第一个五年计划的头四年（一九五一—一九五四），工业生产总值增加了百分之七十六。和一九三六年（那时是法西斯德国生产量最高的时期）相比，产量提高将近一倍。这时期内，除了希特勒战争带来的巨大的经济上的破坏之外，还有由于德国的分裂和统一经济的解体所产生的额外困难需要克服。例如，基本生产资料工业的企业有的必须完全重新修建起来，有的需要在已有的基础上大大地加以扩充。从鲁尔区方面既得不到钢，也得不到煤。主要的钢铁工业、采煤工业和基本生产资料工业都集中在那里。
    在农业中目前共有二千二百个机器拖拉机站分站。农业生产合作社共有五千一百二十个，耕地占全部农业种植面积的百分之十四点八三。
    一九五四年有一百三十六个农业生产合作社已经能够使谷物收割工作完全机械化了。农民的收入单是在一九五四年就增加了五亿五千二百万马克。
    劳动人民生活的改善也表现在商品流转的增加方面。一九五四年零售贸易额比一九五三年增加了百分之十四。总共进行了十六次大规模的减低物价。工人的实际工资不断在增加。
    在文教卫生和社会福利事业方面也获得了巨大的成就。一九五○年还只有二十所大学、高等学校和独立的学院，到一九五四年时便已增到四十六所，从一九五一年到一九五四年，文化和科学方面的经费增加了将近一倍。
    德意志民主共和国目前和世界上七十个国家有着贸易关系。一九五四年，它第一次和阿根廷、印度、印度尼西亚、冰岛、土耳其、乌拉圭和南斯拉夫签订了贸易协定。一九五四年和资本主义市场的贸易额比一九五三年增加了百分之三十二。民主世界市场各国的贸易额占一九五四年贸易总额的百分之七十五。
    德意志民主共和国不断增长的福利的根源是劳动人民的热情和忘我的劳动，首先是生产革新者、积极分子和劳动英雄、发明家和科学家的热情和忘我的劳动。
    同苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的互助合作是对我们的很大的支持。
    德意志民主共和国劳动人民在德国统一社会党——他们伟大胜利的鼓舞者和组织者——的领导下，决心捍卫他们的成果。
    听命于美国的波恩议会、批准巴黎战争协定，是波恩战争集团的卖国行为。他们使西德屈从于美国和德国军国主义分子的利益，加深德国的分裂，并威胁着和平。
    巴黎协定是在违背大多数德国人民的意志的情况下获得批准的。这次投票是在大多数人民——西德人民也一样——的抗议和最坚决反对的情况下举行的。德国工人阶级和一切有爱国热情的德国人，将永远不会承认波恩政府的这种卖国行为。
    一九五五年的德国已不是一九三二年的德国了。西德所有爱国者今天有着可靠的支柱；他们获得德意志民主共和国的大力支持。现在就在于要大大地加强对美国战争和奴役阴谋的民族反抗，在反对军国主义和巴黎战争协定的斗争中建立起全德工人阶级的行动一致，并团结一切爱国力量。“德国人坐到一张桌子旁边来！”是争取统一与和平的斗争的口号。
    苏联军队在十年前把各国人民，首先是德国人民从法西斯枷锁下解放了出来。对德和约一直还没有缔结，而法西斯军国主义分子又在准备新的世界大战了。
    全世界和平力量，首先是苏联和各人民民主国家的人民，是不会容忍这样一种招致毁灭的事态的发展的。因此，德国人民在他们正义的民族斗争中获得世界和平阵营的同情和全力支持。
    德意志民主共和国将一直同民主阵营各国保持友好合作和兄弟般的援助的关系。它希望这种关系在科学和技术、文化、经验交流和货物交换等各方面变得更加紧密、更加巩固起来。我们幸运地和伟大的人民中国亲密地团结在一起，在遍及全球的和平阵营中共同斗争。
  德意志民主共和国和德国人民有许多地方要感激苏联。苏联一直坚决地维护德国人民的利益。苏联给予了德意志民主共和国全部主权，使德意志民主共和国成为各国人民大家庭中的平等的一员。
    伟大的中华人民共和国结束了对德战争状态，支持了我们争取民主统一的斗争。德意志民主共和国和德国人民要通过保卫和维护世界和平，更坚决地把反对西德军国主义的复活、争取重建德国全国统一的斗争胜利地进行到底，作为对这些真诚友谊和深刻信任的慷慨表示的最好答谢。
