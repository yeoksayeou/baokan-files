Practice Thrift, Oppose Waste in Capital Construction!
My Mistakes in Leading Design Work
Wang Jiqi, Deputy Director of the Beijing Industrial Building Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering

Our department convened a design and construction work conference in February. The conference affirmed the progress and achievements of design work and designers over the past few years, and focused on examining and exposing the shortcomings and errors in the work of our institute (formerly known as the Central Design Institute). The People's Daily editorial on March 28 further seriously criticized the phenomenon of waste in construction, pointed out the shortcomings and errors in the work of our institute's leading cadres, exposed the facts of serious errors committed by some projects designed by our institute, and also pointed out that "Architectural Journal" promoted erroneous architectural ideas. These criticisms and exposures are factual and entirely correct.

Subsequently, all comrades in our institute launched a study and conducted an in-depth inspection of past design drawings, discovering that our design ideas and design work had many shortcomings and serious errors.

The main errors in our design thinking and design work were serious violations of the principle of "practicality, economy, and attention to aesthetics where possible," a principle that the Party and the state had directly instructed us to follow. All designs generally neglected practicality and economy, one-sidedly pursued aesthetics, and had tendencies towards formalism and even revivalism. Many buildings were inconvenient to use; they did not take into account current economic conditions, the current level of development of China's productive forces, and the people's living standards, and were divorced from reality with excessively high standards; some pursued extravagance and beauty, exaggerated and ostentatious, wasting national resources. This is a concrete reflection of bourgeois ideology in architectural design work, and its result is that the country and the people have suffered significant losses.

The serious harm of designs made under the control of such ideas can be found everywhere, far exceeding the examples already exposed in the newspapers. For example, the guest room area of the New Beijing Hotel only accounts for 23.7% of the total building area, which is already very wasteful; while the guest room area of the New International Hotel only accounts for 13.2% of the total building area, and not only is excessive and inappropriate decorative painting used indoors, but even decorative painting is used on outdoor parts, such as the pavilions on the roof and the canopies over the gates, which are exposed to sun and rain and require frequent maintenance. For example, in 1952, about 200 yuan per square meter was used to renovate a building. After nearly two years since completion, a palace-style roof was designed and added, and this "big roof" cost about 400 yuan per square meter. This building was already in use before the "big roof" was added, which shows that the addition of the "big roof" had nothing to do with practicality, and solely in pursuit of the so-called "national form," wasted an investment equivalent to constructing 20,000 square meters of ordinary cadre dormitories. The most serious was the design of a club behind Jingshan Park. In the preliminary design stage, in order to compete with Jingshan Park in height, a high-rise building of more than ten stories was adopted, using a "French style" with double eaves and large roofs, to the extreme of luxury. A rough estimate shows the cost would reach 80 million yuan, of which about 20 million yuan would be used for decoration; fortunately, this building was never built, nor was technical design continued. However, this fact shows the development of formalist tendencies and the extent of its harm; it also demonstrates how necessary and timely the Party's correction of erroneous tendencies in architecture is today. From these situations that have been discovered, we deeply and profoundly recognize that the People's Daily editorial stated: "This practice is obviously contrary to the policy of concentrating efforts on key construction, and it is a serious violation of the national financial system, a crime against the country and the people."

As for copying the forms of ancient palaces and temples, the abuse of precious building materials, the adoption of false and cumbersome decorations, causing difficulties and waste in construction, and forcing the construction department to use handicraft methods for individual production, there are many more examples. I completely agree with Comrade Shen Bo's inspection from the Beijing Municipal Design Institute. The situation in our institute is exactly the same as that in the Beijing Municipal Design Institute, so there is no need to give further examples here.

The cause of these errors is certainly due to the existence of serious bourgeois ideology in our institute's design work, violating the Party's principles and policies, but my personal errors are particularly serious, and I have a responsibility to conduct self-criticism here.

After a symposium on urban construction and architectural art in the second half of 1952, certain "authorities" in the architectural field, under the guise of fragmented phrases from advanced architectural theory, or the erroneous remarks of individual architects, gradually formed a theoretical system of formalism and even revivalism, one-sidedly emphasizing and advocating the so-called "national form." I also participated in this symposium, began to come into contact with architectural art issues, and only then began to read the theoretical articles of the "authorities." Because I abandoned the Party's policy on architectural design, which had already been clarified at that time, I was confused by the formalists who decorated themselves with fragmented phrases from advanced architectural theory. In 1953, I was transferred to the design institute, and returned from abroad in May. I did not seriously and comprehensively study the struggle against cosmopolitanism and structuralism in architecture abroad, especially without combining it with China's specific circumstances. I one-sidedly and uncritically conveyed it several times, emphasizing the artistic nature of architecture, and also advocated the so-called "national form," while the principles of practicality and economy were only vaguely mentioned in other reports, and the interrelationship between practicality, economy, and aesthetics was not correctly resolved. Therefore, it objectively played a role in promoting formalist theory, and further became a captive of formalists. In the daily work of our institute, the economic principles of architecture should have been a matter of constant concern for every designer. For us leading cadres, this was the most important issue that should be studied with major effort, and measures taken to lead and supervise. Only on this basis, combined with the specific possible conditions of social and economic development, can the aesthetic problem be solved. However, precisely on this fundamental issue, we made mistakes, so we could not effectively prevent and correct the thinking of designers who generally do not pay attention to saving funds for the country. On the contrary, some architectural designs with obvious tendencies towards extravagance, waste, and revivalism were mostly issued for construction after I had reviewed and approved them. In the winter of 1953, the Architectural Society of China was established, and I was one of the main editors of the "Architectural Journal." The two issues of the "Architectural Journal" that had already been published almost entirely discussed architectural art issues, and there was no introduction of standard designs and advanced technologies in construction, as well as papers related to practicality and economy; on the contrary, the domestic creations introduced in the two issues were all luxurious and wasteful designs with revivalist tendencies, which were precisely the typical examples criticized in this opposition to waste in capital construction. This made the "Architectural Journal" a publication that promoted formalism, revivalism, and advocated waste and luxury. Later, the academic committee of the Architectural Society held a creative discussion meeting to discuss the four newly completed hotel-like buildings (Beijing Hotel, International Hotel, Overseas Chinese Hotel, and Xijiao Hotel). The focus of heated discussion at the meeting was mainly on formal issues such as shape, facade, decoration, color, etc., and only a few comrades mentioned in general terms that there was waste among them. As the actual host of this discussion, I did not care about and notice that these four buildings had serious waste problems to varying degrees, and also had serious impractical problems to varying degrees. On the contrary, I believed that these four buildings were the more successful architectural designs in 1953 and 1954.

From these main manifestations above, my formalist tendencies in architectural design thinking have gradually developed and gradually become serious. If the Party had not promptly checked and corrected them, the harm to the country and the people would have been even more serious. I deeply feel the pain and the seriousness of the responsibility. After this study, I deeply realize that I must strengthen the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism in the future, strengthen the study of the Party's policies, strengthen the political and ideological leadership in the work of our institute, promote materialism and criticize idealist ideas among all working comrades, resolutely draw a clear line with bourgeois ideas in architectural design, first of all, with formalist and revivalist ideas, and conduct struggles to gradually eliminate them, so as to consolidate socialist design ideas, implement the Party and the state's policies on architectural design, and ensure the timely completion, improved quality, and reduced costs of supervised design work. At the same time, we must enrich and strengthen technical management work, especially regarding technical standardization work, the research and review of design technical conditions, the analysis of technical and economic indicators, make more economic comparison schemes, vigorously carry out standard design, so that the realization of correct design ideas can be technically guaranteed.

### 厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！　我在领导设计工作中的错误

　　厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！
　　我在领导设计工作中的错误
　　建筑工程部北京工业建筑设计院副院长　汪季琦
    我部于二月间召开了设计和施工工作会议，会上肯定了几年来设计工作和设计人员的进步和成绩，同时着重地检查和揭发了我院（原名中央设计院）工作中的缺点和错误。三月二十八日人民日报社论又进一步地严肃地批评了在建筑中的浪费现象，指出了我院领导干部工作的缺点和错误；揭发了我院所设计的某些工程所犯的严重错误的事实；同时又指出“建筑学报”宣传了错误的建筑思想。这些批评和揭发，都是合乎事实的，都是十分正确的。
    接着我院全体同志展开了学习，对过去设计图纸进行深入检查，发现我们在设计思想和设计工作中的缺点很多，错误很严重。
    我们设计思想和设计工作的主要错误是严重地违反了“实用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观”的方针，这是党和国家曾经直接指示给我们的方针。各项设计普遍地忽视实用、经济，片面地追求美观，存在着形式主义，乃至复古主义的倾向。许多建筑使用上不方便；没有照顾当前经济条件、当前我国生产力发展的水准和人民生活水平，脱离实际，标准过高；有些则追求富丽华美，虚夸铺张，浪费了国家资财。这是资产阶级思想在建筑设计工作中的具体反映，其结果是使国家和人民遭受了重大损失。
    在这样的思想支配下做出来的设计，其严重的危害性随处都可以发现，远不止报纸上所已经揭发出来的一些例子。比如新北京饭店的客房面积只占总建筑面积的百分之二十三点七，已经很浪费了；而新国际饭店的客房面积只占总建筑面积的一十三点二，并且不仅室内彩画用得过多和不恰当，甚至把彩画用于室外部分，如屋顶上的亭子和大门门罩之上，日晒雨淋，经常需要维修。又如在一九五二年用了约每平方公尺二百元翻修了一座建筑物，完工已近二年，又去设计和加建一个宫殿式的屋顶，这个“大屋顶”用去了约每平方公尺四百元的造价。这座建筑物在未加“大屋顶”以前已经在使用，这就说明了加修“大屋顶”完全同实用无关，仅仅为了追求所谓“民族形式”，就浪费了相当于可以修建二万平方公尺的一般干部宿舍的投资。最为严重的是景山后面一个俱乐部的设计，在进行初步设计中，为了同景山争高度，采用十几层的高层建筑，按照“法式”，采用重檐大顶，极尽豪华，概略估算一下，造价将达八千万元，而其中用于装修和装饰的部分约达二千万元；幸而这项建筑未曾修建，也没有继续做技术设计。但从这件事实中，可以看出形式主义倾向的发展，其危害之严重达到了什么程度；也可以认识到党今天来纠正建筑的错误倾向是如何的必要和及时。从这些检查出来的情况，使我们十分沉重和深刻地认识了人民日报社论中所说的：“这种作法显然是同集中力量进行重点建设的方针背道而驰的，这是严重违反国家财政制度的行为，是对国家和人民的犯罪。”
    至于抄袭古代宫殿庙宇的形式，滥用贵重的建筑材料，采取虚伪而繁琐的装饰，造成施工上的困难和浪费，并使施工部门不得不用手工业方式去个别制作等等，例子还很多。我完全同意北京市设计院沈勃同志的检查，我院的情形是和北京市设计院全然相同，不需在此再举例说明了。
    产生这种错误的原因，固然由于我院的设计工作存在着严重的资产阶级思想，违反了党的原则方针，但是我个人的错误特别严重，我有责任在这里进行自我批评。
    一九五二年下半年在某一次城市建设和建筑艺术座谈会之后，建筑界的某些“权威人士”假借了先进建筑理论中的片断词句，或个别建筑师的错误的言论，逐渐形成一套形式主义乃至复古主义的理论体系，片面地强调提倡所谓“民族形式”。我也参加了这次座谈会，开始接触到建筑艺术问题，也才开始阅读到“权威人士”的理论文章。由于我放弃了当时早已明确了的党对建筑设计的方针，因而被以先进建筑理论的片断词句装饰起来的形式主义者所迷惑住了。一九五三年我调到设计院，五月份从国外回来，对于国外正在反对建筑中的世界主义、结构主义的斗争，没有认真地全面地进行过研究，特别是没有和我国的具体情况相结合，片面地不加分析、不加批判地进行了几次传达，强调建筑的艺术性，也提倡所谓“民族形式”，而对于实用、经济的原则则仅在其他问题的报告中含糊地提到，没有正确地解决实用、经济和美观的相互关系问题。因而客观上起了对形式主义理论的助长作用，也就进一步成为形式主义者的俘虏。在我院的日常工作中，建筑中的经济原则本应该是每个设计人员时刻关心的问题，对于我们这些领导干部来说，这是应当用主要精力来研究，采取措施，进行领导监督的最重要的问题。只有在这个基础之上，结合社会经济发展的具体可能条件，才能解决美观问题。但是恰恰在这个根本问题上，我们犯了错误，因此，就不能有力地防止和纠正设计人员中普遍存在的不注意为国家节约资金的思想。相反地，一些铺张浪费、复古主义倾向很明显的建筑设计，大多数是在我看过和同意之后，才发交施工的。一九五三年冬中国建筑学会成立，我是“建筑学报”的主要编辑人员之一，已经出版的两期“建筑学报”，几乎完全谈的建筑艺术问题，对于标准设计和建筑上的先进技术，以及有关实用、经济方面的论文，没有任何介绍；相反地，两期中所介绍的国内创作，都是豪华浪费，有复古主义倾向的设计，恰恰是这次反对基本建设中的浪费被批评的典型。这就使“建筑学报”成为宣传形式主义、复古主义，提倡浪费豪华的刊物。其后，建筑学会的学术委员会召开过一次创作讨论会，讨论新落成的四座旅馆性质的建筑物（北京饭店、国际饭店、新侨饭店和西郊招待所），会上热烈讨论的中心主要是体形、立面、装饰、色彩等等的形式问题，只有少数同志较笼统地提到了其中有浪费。而作为这次讨论会的实际主持人的我，并没有关心和注意到这四座建筑物都有不同程度的严重的浪费问题，也有严重的不同程度的不切实用的问题，相反地，还认为这四座建筑物是一九五三年至一九五四年中较成功的建筑设计。
    从以上这些主要表现来看，我的建筑设计思想中的形式主义倾向是逐步发展和逐步严重的。如果不是党及时地检查纠正，对国家人民的危害还会更加严重，我深切感到沉痛和责任的重大。经过这次学习，我深刻地认识到今后必须加强马克思列宁主义的理论学习，加强对党的政策的学习，加强在我院工作中的政治思想领导，要在全体工作同志中宣传唯物主义，批判唯心主义思想，坚决地与建筑设计中的资产阶级思想，首先是同形式主义、复古主义思想划清界限，进行斗争，并逐步加以肃清，以巩固社会主义的设计思想，贯彻党和国家对建筑设计的方针，保证监督设计工作的及时完成、提高质量和降低成本。同时要充实和加强技术管理工作，特别是有关于技术统一工作，设计技术条件的研究和审查，技术经济指标的分析，多做经济比较方案，大力进行标准设计，使正确设计思想的实现获得技术上的保证。
