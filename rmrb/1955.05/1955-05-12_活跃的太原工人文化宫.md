The beautiful summer has arrived at the workers' rest park of the Taiyuan Suburban Workers' Cultural Palace. Lilacs and peonies are in full bloom. In the first four days of May, more than 30,000 steel, chemical, machinery, electrical, and textile workers visited the Cultural Palace for sightseeing, theatrical performances, and dancing. In the Cultural Palace's stadium, weekend evening galas with rich programs and various ball games on Sundays attracted many workers. The Shanxi People's Jin Opera Troupe No. 2 is performing various historical dramas in the Cultural Palace's cinema and theater department. Each performance attracts more than 1,000 audience members. In May, amateur theatrical troupes from various factories and mines will also perform here for five or six days. The amateur choir composed of outstanding singers selected from 90% of the city's factories and mines also frequently holds activities here. The Cultural Palace's library recently added more than 400 new books, receiving more than 300 worker readers every afternoon.

The Taiyuan Suburban Workers' Cultural Palace was built by the Taiyuan Federation of Trade Unions. It covers an area of more than 480 mu. This Cultural Palace now has a workers' rest park covering more than 60,000 square meters, a library with more than 20,000 books, a well-equipped sports field, and a cinema and theater department that can accommodate more than 1,700 people. Since the beginning of spring this year, the workers' rest park has undergone a major renovation, with a new artificial mountain and some pavilions built inside the park. The newly built children's playground will also be completed in May. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　活跃的太原工人文化宫
    美丽的夏天来临太原市郊工人文化宫工人休息公园里，紫丁香和牡丹花正在盛开。五月的头四天中，三万多个钢铁、化学、机械、电业和纺织工人到文化宫来游览、观剧、跳舞。在文化宫的体育场里，节目丰富的周末晚会和星期天的各种球类比赛吸引了许多工人。山西人民晋剧第二团正在文化宫的影剧部演出各种古装剧。每场观众都在一千人以上。五月份，各厂矿的职工业余剧团还要在这里演出五天或六天。从全市百分之九十的厂矿中选拔出来的优秀歌手们组成的业余合唱团，也经常在这里活动，文化宫的图书馆最近新增加了四百多册书，每天下午要接待三百多位工人读者。
    太原市郊的工人文化宫是太原市工会联合会修建的。它的面积共有四百八十多亩。这座文化宫现在已经有一座占地六万多平方公尺的工人休息公园，一座有两万多册书的图书馆，一个设备完善的运动场和一座可容一千七百多人的影剧部。今年开春以后，工人休息公园又进行了一次大整修，园内新建筑了一座假山和一些凉亭。新建的儿童游艺场也将在五月份完工。（新华社）
