　　Purge This Bad Guy, Hu Feng
　　Zhou Libo
    After reading the second batch of Hu Feng's secret letters published in the "People's Daily," we feel that after liberation, Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary activities have become even more rampant and insidious.

    In these letters, he scolded revolutionary literary and art workers as "flies and mosquitoes," and openly and maliciously slandered our Party Central Committee. He said that Comrade Mao Zedong's epoch-making document "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was "treated as a 'totem' booklet." What is a "totem"? Primitive people worship an animal or other natural object as sacred, which is called a "totem." Hu Feng is so base as to slander our leader's universally recognized scientific theory in this way.

    Most insidious is that he hates this work so much in his heart, but he instructs his followers to learn from him and adopt a double-dealing approach:
    "Do not touch it literally, but follow it where possible, as I did in 'Road'."

    From every letter of his, we can hear his gnashing of teeth against revolutionary literature and art and the Chinese Communist Party. He said:
    "But I am sharpening my sword, watching the direction. When I am sure, I am willing to cut off my head and throw it out to smash that dirty, smelly iron wall."

    He uses "dirty, smelly iron wall" to describe our new society today. Of course, even if ten thousand of his dirty, smelly dog heads are thrown out, they will not break our steel-like revolutionary reality, but from his tone, we can hear his fierce and ruthless opposition to the revolution.

    He reminds people of the evil ghosts in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" who wear human skin.

    In these letters, he always wants his followers to abide by various strategies and tactics, and wants them to "try the tactic of Sun Wukong drilling into the belly." He also orders his people to "abide by organizational principles," and says:
    "Organizational principles are to ensure combat." When his attack on the revolution suffered defeat, he instructed his party members: "Don't be in pain, be calm." "And only by enduring can you seek rebirth," asking his people to criticize themselves in order to muddle through. He also instructed them to "preserve strength."

    He has more than once instigated his followers lurking in our organs to steal Party documents.

    From the above, it can be seen that the Hu Feng group is by no means a literary and art faction with only ideological errors, but a fierce counter-revolutionary group with a plan, an organization, and a set of anti-revolutionary strategies and tactics. Hu Feng is not like a writer at all, but a sworn enemy of the revolution. We demand that he be purged from the literary and art circles and that his counter-revolutionary crimes be punished according to law.

　　清洗胡风这个坏家伙
　　周立波
    看了“人民日报”发表的胡风的第二批密信，我们觉得，解放以后，胡风的反革命活动，更加猖獗和阴毒了。
    在这些信里，他骂革命文艺工作者是“苍蝇蚊子”，并且公然恶毒地诋毁我们的党中央。他说毛泽东同志的划时代的文件“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”是“被当作了‘图腾’的小册子”。什么是“图腾”呢？原始社会的人，把一种动物，或其它自然物当作神圣来崇拜叫作“图腾”。胡风就是这样卑劣地污蔑我们的领袖举世公认的科学理论的。
    最阴险的是他心里这样恨这一著作，却又指示他的喽罗们，要他们学他的样，采取两面的手法：
  “字面上不要去碰它，可能的地方还要顺着它，如我在‘路’所做的。”
    从他的每一封信里，我们都可以听出他对革命文艺、对中国共产党的咬牙切齿的声音。他说：
  “但我在磨我的剑，窥测方向，到我看准了的时候，我愿意割下我的头颅抛掷出去，把那个脏臭的铁壁击碎的。”
    他用“脏臭的铁壁”来形容今天的我们的新社会。自然，像他那样的脏臭的狗头，抛掷一万个，也打不碎我们的钢铁般的革命的现实，但从他的口气上，我们可以听出他的反对革命的凶恶的狠心。
    他使人想起了“聊斋志异”上的披着人皮的恶鬼。
    在这些信里，他总是要他的喽罗遵守各种战略和战术，要他们“试用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”。他还命令他的人“要遵守组织原则”，并且说：
  “组织原则是为了保证战斗的。”等到他对革命的进攻遭到了失败，他就指示他的党徒：“不要痛苦，千万冷静。”“并且只有在忍受中求得重生”，要他的人批评他自己，以蒙混过关。他还吩咐他们“保存力量”。
    他不止一次地指使潜伏在我们机关里的他的喽罗偷窃党内的文件。
    从上所述，可以看出，胡风集团绝对不是什么只有思想错误的文艺流派，而是一个有计划，有组织，有一套反对革命的战略战术的凶狠的反革命集团。胡风不但不像个作家，而且是革命的死敌。我们要求把他从文艺界清洗出去。并对其反革命罪行依法予之制裁。
