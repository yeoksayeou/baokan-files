Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch from London: The British "Economist" magazine recently published an article discussing the economic interests of France being squeezed out by the United States in South Vietnam and the contradictions between the US and France.

The article stated, "Among the many reasons for friction between France and the United States in Vietnam is the change in the way South Vietnam trades." The article believes that what prompted this change was the United States no longer channeling economic "aid" to South Vietnam through France but directly. The article pointed out that, "The inevitable result is that imports from France or other parts of the French Federation are reduced, giving way to goods from the dollar area. In fact, since January 1st, about 80 percent of all imports to South Vietnam have been paid for by US economic assistance."

The magazine mentioned that "the change in South Vietnam's trade patterns has worried French merchants since last year." For example, in October of last year, imports from the United States were second only to imports from France. And South Vietnam's exports to the United States (93 million piastres) exceeded its exports to France (62 million piastres). The "Economist" also said that by mid-March of this year, about 90 million US dollars out of 240 million US "aid" dollars had been made available. A large amount of American surplus materials poured in, causing "complaints" from Saigon newspapers. For example, the "Chung Sheng Pao" (Bell Newspaper) believes that although South Vietnam produces tobacco locally and its rivers are full of fish, South Vietnam is still importing US dollar tobacco and canned fish.

The "Economist" also said, "The Americans are dissatisfied with the possible impact of French actions in North Vietnam," and "the United States also opposes France resuming large-scale trade with North Vietnam."

　　论述美法在南越的经济矛盾
    新华社七日讯　伦敦消息：英国“经济学家”杂志最近刊登了一篇文章，论述美国在南越排挤法国的经济利益和美法之间的矛盾。
    文章说，“在法国和美国在越南的许多磨擦原因当中有一个就是南越贸易方式的转变”。文章认为促成这种转变的是美国不再通过法国而把经济
  “援助”直接交给南越。文章指出，这样，“不可避免的结果就是，来自法国或法兰西联邦的其他部分的进口货减少，而让位于来自美元区的货物。事实上，从一月一日起，南越全部进口货的百分之八十左右的代价是由美国经济援助来偿付的。”
    这个杂志提到，“南越贸易形式的转变，从去年起就已使法国商人担忧。”例如在去年十月份，从美国来的进口货已仅次于来自法国的进口货。而南越对美国的输出（九千三百万皮阿斯特）已超过了对法国的输出（六千二百万皮阿斯特）。“经济学家”又说，到今年三月中旬，二亿四千万美“援”中约有九千万美元已可供使用。大批的美国剩余物资倾泻而来，引起了西贡报纸的“抱怨”。例如，
  “钟声报”就认为，虽然南越本地出产烟草，南越的河流充满着鱼类，但南越仍在进口美元烟草和罐头鱼。
    “经济学家”还说，“美国人对法国在北越的行动可能的影响感到不满”，“美国还反对法国同北越恢复大规模的贸易”。
