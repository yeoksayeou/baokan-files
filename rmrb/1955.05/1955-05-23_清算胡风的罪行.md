Settle Accounts with Hu Feng's Crimes
　　Cai Meibiao
　　Shu Wu's provided "materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party clique" powerfully exposes Hu Feng's true colors. Hu Feng was originally the most despicable and insidious anti-Party element. The odor smelled from Hu Feng's letters is completely the stench of Kuomintang secret agents! Hu Feng's purpose of "winning people over" to establish a small clique was not only to oppose the Party from a literary and ideological perspective, but also from a political one!
　　All revolutionaries should launch a resolute struggle against Hu Feng's reactionary behavior!
　　Hu Feng's hostility towards the Party and the revolution is consistent and thorough. He used all sorts of bad words to smear the Party, the revolution, and revolutionary literary workers. The purpose of his activities for many years was to "fight" the Party, regarding the Party and the literary and art ranks led by the Party as his enemies. His means of attacking the Party and the revolution were malicious. Like a fascist agent, he used "a whip wrapped in rubber-coated wire to beat prisoners, causing injuries that are not visible on the surface!" This is what he considered a "good method." His attack on the Party was resolute. He said that if the anti-Party publication he ran "compromised, why publish it!" His attitude was to "continue the fight," "fight and retreat," "no discouragement allowed! ... No relaxation," "advance amidst bleeding," and "must be determined to coexist with the position." Hu Feng's anti-Party and counter-revolutionary behavior, like that of the dying reactionary class, was consistently uncompromising and unwilling to give up!
　　Since Hu Feng was hostile to the Party and the revolution, he would inevitably be hostile to all progressive and revolutionary writers, whether Party members or not. From his letters, it can be seen that he even regarded commemorating Lu Xun as a "disaster" and "extremely boring," and ridiculed Wen Yiduo's progressive activities, who was brutally murdered by the reactionaries, as "opportunistic" and "hitting the mark." In addition, he used insulting terms and abusive language to slander almost all progressive writers who supported the Party. Last year, his large-scale attacks on the "People's Daily" were a continuation and development of this reactionary behavior.
　　However, when Hu Feng attacked the Party and progressive writers, he disguised himself as a Marxist. Let us look at the real words Hu Feng said in his secret letters! His attitude towards the Party was "perfunctory always has to be perfunctory," "to stand in this circle and not fall down, one has no choice but to accompany them in the pantomime," "later, before writing, one has to transform into those lords, and then fight against oneself who has been transformed into those lords, while preventing them from not understanding, and preventing them from constituting a crime." First, disguise himself as a "Marxist," and then attack Marxism. This is Hu Feng's consistent method of concealing himself and deceiving others. Hu Feng used this method to deceive people, and then cried out triumphantly and frantically: "Make me set up an array of doubts, so that they see flags all over the mountains, and do not dare to easily attack. How fast is this!"
　　Hu Feng also looked for "targets" at any time to form his group, and launched attacks on the Party in an organized and planned manner. This group agreed to "not mention it to outsiders," communicated secretly, secretly discussed how to use "the tactics of cluster grenades" to attack the Party, discussed how to "contact people," "win people over," and how to use "blunt weapons" and "grenades" to strike people, discussed how to "strengthen strength," "open up work," and "shake the ruling forces of twenty years of mechanism." Finally, they openly shouted to abolish the leadership of the Party. Isn't this clear enough? Can this still be said to be only an ideological mistake and not necessarily a political one?
　　Like all reactionary bandits, Hu Feng is an ambitious fellow. He not only wanted to abolish the Party's leadership in the literary and art circles and strengthen the strength of his group to usurp the Party's leadership, but also said that "everything is ready for me," and even wanted to "take the world as his responsibility." Hu Feng's personal ambition has developed to such an alarming extent!
　　The materials revealed by Shu Wu, although only a part of the materials of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, completely illustrate Hu Feng's consistent anti-Party and counter-revolutionary insidiousness. In order to realize these attempts, he was omnipresent. We know that this criticism of Hu Feng started with the criticism of Yu Pingbo's bourgeois idealist ideas. When criticizing Yu Pingbo, Hu Feng did not let go of the opportunity to exploit loopholes, under the guise of opposing bourgeois ideology, but in reality attacking the Party, attacking Marxism, in order to realize his despicable personal ambitions.
　　This is of course not accidental, but a reflection of the complexity and sharpness of class struggle in our country's transition period.
　　As the editor's note of the "People's Daily" said: "Such revolutionary imposters like Hu Feng or similar to Hu Feng are certainly a minority, but they are very harmful. They can sneak into our Party, army, state organs, cultural organs, people's organizations and enterprise organs, and do many bad things." This reminds us that at any time, do not be fascinated by some verbal or literal Marxist words, and think carefully about everything, whether it is true Marxism or a disguise of anti-Marxism with ulterior motives! Losing this revolutionary vigilance will inevitably be deceived by counter-revolutionaries.
　　All those who have been deceived by Hu Feng and followed him, quickly wake up, abandon evil and return to righteousness, and start a new life!

### 清算胡风的罪行

　　清算胡风的罪行
　　蔡美彪
    舒芜所提供的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”，有力地揭破了胡风的真面貌。胡风原来是个最卑鄙最阴险的反党分子。从胡风信上所嗅到的气味完全是国民党特务的臭味！胡风“争取人”建立小集团的目的，不仅是要从文艺思想上，而且也从政治上反对党，反对革命！
    一切革命的人都应该向胡风的这种反动行为展开坚决的斗争！
    胡风敌视党、敌视革命是一贯的、彻头彻尾的。他用了一切坏的字眼来诬蔑党、诬蔑革命、诬蔑革命的文艺工作者。他许多年来活动的目的就是要向党“作战”，把党和党所领导的文艺队伍看成他的仇敌。他向党和革命进攻的手段是恶毒的，他像法西斯特务一样“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕！”这是他所认为的“好方法”。他向党的进攻是坚决的。他说他所办的反党的刊物“如果妥协，又何必出它呢！”他的态度是“再接再厉”、“且战且走”、“泄气不得！……松不得劲”，“一面流血一面走”，而且“非抱着与阵地共存亡的决心不可”。胡风反党反革命的行为，和垂死的反动阶级一样始终一贯，死不甘休！
    胡风既然敌视党敌视革命，也就必然地敌视一切党或非党的进步的革命的作家。从他的信中可以看到，他甚至把纪念鲁迅看成是“灾难”“无聊之至”，把惨遭反动派杀害的闻一多的进步活动嘲笑为“投机”“投中了”。此外，他几乎对一切进步的拥护党的作家，都加上侮辱的名词，横加谩骂。去年他对“人民日报”大肆攻击，也正是这种反动行为的继续和发展。
    但是，胡风向党向进步作家进攻的时候，却是把自己伪装为一个马克思主义者的。让我们看看胡风在密信中所说的真心话吧！他对党的态度是“敷衍总是要敷衍的”，“要在这圈子里站着不倒下，也就不得不奉陪一道跳加官”，“以后得在下笔前先变成老爷们，再来和变成了老爷们的自己作战，一面妨（防）止他们不懂，一面妨（防）止他们构成罪案”。先把自己化装成“马克思主义者”，然后再向马克思主义进攻，这就是胡风一贯地掩护自己和欺骗别人的手法。胡风用这种手法骗了人，还自鸣得意地疯狂地喊道：“使我布得成疑阵，使他们看来遍山旗帜，不敢轻易来犯，快何如之。”
    胡风还随时物色“对象”，组成他的集团，有组织有计划地向党进攻。这个集团以“望勿与外人道及”相约，秘密往来，秘密地商量着怎样使用
  “集束手榴弹的战术”向党进攻，商量着怎样“联络人”，“争取人”和怎样利用“闷棍”“手榴弹”打击人，商量着怎样“加强实力”，“开辟工作”，
  “动摇二十年的机械论的统治势力”。最后，竟公然喊出要取消党的领导。这还不清楚么？这难道还能说是只是思想方面的，而未必是政治方面的错误么？
    和一切反动匪徒一样，胡风是个野心勃勃的家伙。他不仅要在文艺界取消党的领导，加强他的集团的实力以篡夺党的领导，而且还说什么“万物皆备于我”，甚至要“以天下为己任”。胡风的个人野心，已经发展到这样骇人的地步！
    舒芜所揭露的材料，虽然还只是胡风反党集团的一部分材料，但就是这些材料也完全说明了胡风的一贯反党反革命的阴险。为了实现这些企图，他是无孔不入的。我们知道，这次批判胡风，是从批判俞平伯的资产阶级唯心主义思想开始的。在批判俞平伯的时候，胡风也还不放过机会，钻空子，借着反对资产阶级思想为名，而实际上是在攻击党，攻击马克思主义，以实现他的卑鄙的个人野心。
    这当然不是偶然的，而是我国过渡时期阶级斗争复杂化和尖锐化的反映。
    正如“人民日报”编者按语所说：“像胡风或类似胡风的这种冒称革命的伪装分子当然是少数，但是为害却甚大，他们可以钻进我们的党内，军内，国家机关内，文化机关内，人民团体内和企业机关内，做出许多坏事来。”这就提醒了我们，在任何时候，都不要被一些口头上或字面上的马克思主义词句所迷住，凡事都要认真想一想，是真马克思主义，还是别有用心的反马克思主义的伪装！丧失了这种革命的警惕性，就难免要遭到反革命的欺骗。
    凡是已经受了胡风欺骗而跟着跑的人，赶快清醒过来，改邪归正，重新作人！
