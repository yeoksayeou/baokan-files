It Is Necessary to Substantially Improve Labor Competitions
Li Ping

    In the process of realizing socialist construction in our country, labor competition is an important method of mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers to complete the great construction tasks of our country. In order to further tap the production potential in industry, better utilize existing equipment, production sites and raw materials, vigorously carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, further improve working methods, master new technologies, consolidate labor discipline, and improve the political, cultural and technical level of the broad masses of workers, to further promote the improvement of the production equilibrium rate and the improvement of production management, and to constantly overcome the bureaucratic phenomena in enterprises, and to continuously improve labor productivity and comprehensively complete all the indicators of the national plan, it is necessary to organize labor competitions for the broad masses.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working class of our country has launched extensive labor competition movements and achieved remarkable results. Through competition, many factories and mines have effectively overcome difficulties and better completed the state's production and construction plans. Through competition, a large number of advanced workers have emerged in many factories and mines, and the entire working class has also been improved politically, technically, and culturally as a result.
    However, it should be pointed out that due to the lack of experience of some organizers of our labor competitions, insufficient learning from the Soviet Union, and also due to various objective reasons, some blindness has occurred in the labor competition process in the past few years. In the years before 1954, most of the labor competitions in our country's factories and mines were somewhat focused on physical exertion and increased labor intensity, which caused excessive fatigue for the workers and had a limited effect on production, thus making the competition movement unsustainable, unpopular and unimproved. To some extent, this shortcoming was difficult to completely avoid at a certain stage of the movement's development. In view of this shortcoming, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions accepted the suggestions of seven advanced workers in 1954 and put forward a new slogan – "Technical Innovation" – as the main content of a new stage of labor competition. This intention to raise labor competition a step further and combine it with the improvement of technology is correct. In fact, since the slogan of "Technical Innovation" was put forward, many workers have paid attention to technical issues, thereby promoting the rationalization proposal movement, helping to solve certain technical problems in production, and partially overcoming the shortcomings of relying solely on physical strength in the past competitions. In this regard, the technical innovation movement has achieved certain results. However, this movement has not yet realistically solved the problem of how to correctly combine labor competition with improving technology, and therefore has not been able to fundamentally overcome the shortcomings of relying solely on physical strength, nor has it been able to fundamentally overcome some of the blindness in previous competitions. Not only that, but due to the imperfection and inaccuracy of the content of this movement, and its inability to include the broadest masses, some new shortcomings and biases have also arisen, hindering the further development and improvement of labor competition. Therefore, correctly summarizing the experiences and lessons of past labor competitions has become the key to further improving labor competitions at present.
    What are the main experiences and lessons that can be drawn from past labor competition work?
    First, for labor competitions to truly succeed, they must be correctly combined with learning and mastering advanced technology; they must proceed from the actual situation of the workers, mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses to strive to improve their political, cultural and technical levels, and on this basis, practically improve the technical level of production. The common problem in China's industry is the small variety, low quality, high cost, and insufficient supply of raw materials. In addition to objective factors, the prominent problems of industrial production itself, especially heavy industrial production, are: high technical requirements for products, while the level of production management and technical level are far from the requirements. In recent years, on the one hand, our country has built many modern industrial enterprises, and many new technical equipment have also been added to the original enterprises, which requires a larger number and higher quality of skilled workers and technicians to quickly master the new technical equipment and learn new working methods to manufacture the increasing number of new products; on the other hand, the work of cultivating and developing technical forces is far from keeping up with the needs of the rapid development of our country's industry, and the average technical level of workers has been greatly reduced due to the influx of a large number of novices into the working class. This has formed a prominent contradiction that urgently needs to be resolved. To solve this contradiction, we must first earnestly implement Chairman Mao's instructions, set off a wave of learning from the Soviet Union, and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in a realistic and honest manner (of course, learning from the Soviet Union does not only refer to advanced experience in technology, but should include all aspects of theory, science, technology, organization, management, etc.), and at the same time, we must have leadership and planning to promote our own effective advanced experience. It is necessary to combine labor competition with learning and mastering advanced technology, and guide the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and technicians to the track of specifically, effectively, and appropriately truly learning and mastering advanced production technology. To this end, it is also necessary to simultaneously and effectively improve the basic knowledge of culture and technology of the broad masses of workers, because only by improving the level of this basic knowledge can the broad masses of workers have the conditions to truly and effectively master advanced technology and promote advanced experience, and can the promotion of advanced experience become an effective movement for the broad masses to improve production. This is a common requirement of our country's factories and mines; of course, for enterprises with different situations (such as newly built, rebuilt and original enterprises), workers and technicians with different situations (such as old workers, new workers, original technicians, new graduates from schools, or new technicians promoted from workers, etc.), specific requirements suitable for the situation must also be put forward. Past experience has proved that in labor competitions, where the realistic situation of the workers is taken into account, the honest learning of advanced experience from the Soviet Union and our country is advocated, and the honest learning of technology and culture is advocated, it is possible to effectively improve the technical level of the broad masses of workers, enable them to truly learn and master new technologies, and propose and promote rationalization proposals with a foundation and purpose, enable the broad masses of workers to truly and widely participate in the competition movement, and effectively improve the level of production. In this way, the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses can be prevented from being wasted, and can truly produce great results. Conversely, if this is not done, the effect will be less and the shortcomings will be more. In the technical innovation movement, some factories and mines had such problems: they did not effectively advocate the honest learning and promotion of advanced experience from the Soviet Union and our country, but mainly paid attention to the invention and creation of innovative technologies. However, although invention and creation may have a certain mass character, it is ultimately a matter for a relatively small number of people. It is impossible for most workers to actively and effectively participate, especially under the current conditions where the cultural and technical level of the broad masses of workers is very low. Labor competition is a matter for all workers, therefore, it is difficult and inappropriate to use "technical innovation" as the main content of a broad mass labor competition movement. In order to further improve labor competition, we must aim at the basic weaknesses in our industry, place the competition on a solid, reliable, effective, and lasting foundation, so that labor competition can truly help solve the basic problem of backward manufacturing technology in our industry, and truly become a driving force for improving the level of production.
    Second, for labor competitions to truly succeed, they must proceed from the actual production situation of the current industry, especially the enterprise, and put forward appropriate and specific competition goals. The main problem in implementing the industrial production plan now is that many enterprises often fail to comprehensively and evenly complete the various indicators of the national plan, and many enterprises only focus on the completion of product quantity indicators, and even in the quantity indicators, they often only pay more attention to the completion of the total output value, and pay less attention to the completion of the product quantity indicators. As for the completion of new product trial production tasks to expand varieties, improve product quality, and reduce costs, these main indicators have not been given due attention. Although there are general common tasks in industry, specifically speaking, not only between different industrial sectors, but also between various enterprises in the same sector and the same specialty, and even between various workshops in an enterprise, there are their own production characteristics and key problems. Therefore, under the general requirements of the national plan, launching labor competitions with correct goals according to the specific production characteristics and key problems of each enterprise has become another important link in whether the competition can achieve significant results. In the past, where this was done correctly, the competition achieved better results, and the enterprise's production also made more progress. Where this was not done correctly, although the competition could be superficially lively for a while, the actual effect would not be very great, and sometimes even cause some difficulties in production. In the technical innovation movement, some enterprises had such shortcomings. Some comrades were unable to deeply analyze the specific situation of their enterprises, taking the solution of the specific key problems of their enterprises' production and strengthening the weak links of their enterprises' production as the realistic goals of the competition, but mechanically applied the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel, pursuing automation and mechanization in general, and pursuing invention and creation. In this way, the technical innovation movement was divorced from the actual production needs of the enterprise, and could not obtain the due effect of the competition. In order to further improve labor competition, we must resolutely overcome and prevent the above-mentioned deviation from reality, and truly base ourselves on the specific production situation of each enterprise, taking the solution of key production problems, strengthening weak links, and comprehensively and evenly completing the various indicators of the production plan as the clear goals of labor competition.
    Third, for labor competitions to truly succeed, they must be a unified action of the enterprise, and must be the common combat task of various organizations within the enterprise. Precisely because labor competition is a major struggle to promote the advanced, overcome the backward, and oppose bureaucratic phenomena, and is a great driving force for completing socialist construction, various organizations in the enterprise must fully carry out criticism and self-criticism, strive to realize their respective responsibilities in the labor competition, and give full play to the due role of each organization in the competition. For example, the Party organization should give a clear direction to the labor competition ideologically and politically, grasp the ideological dynamics of the broad masses of workers in accordance with the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies, promptly discover and support advanced things in the competition, correct errors and shortcomings in the competition, and unify the work steps of various organizations. The administrative organization should clearly recognize ideologically that labor competition is the basic method of relying on the broad masses to complete the production plan. Therefore, it is necessary not only to make the broad masses of workers clearly aware of the production situation and key problems, but also to give the labor competition due support in material conditions, adopt effective organizational and technical measures to improve production, adopt advanced technology, improve labor organization, rectify and formulate process regulations and various quotas, continuously improve production management methods in the competition process, and work together to promote the labor competition movement. At the same time, the administrative organization must also make administrative staff actively participate in labor competition, making them an organic organizational component of the movement. The trade union organization should, under the leadership of the Party and the support of the administration, deeply mobilize the workers to carry out practical and effective competition, and at the same time correctly pay attention to the economic and cultural interests of the workers, and closely combine the overall interests of the country with the immediate interests of the masses. The Youth League should mobilize the broad masses of young workers to better participate in the competition. In the past competitions, the various organizations in some enterprises often failed to unify their work steps, resulting in phenomena such as competition being competition, production being production, and management being management, which were mutually separated or even conflicted. This, of course, made the competition unable to achieve the due effect. This phenomenon was not only not overcome in the technical innovation movement, but even further developed in some units. In order to further improve labor competition, we must resolutely overcome this tendency of mutual disengagement, separation, and dispersion, and must truly regard labor competition as a common combat action of the enterprise as a whole.
    Recently, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions summarized the work of labor competition in the past year, and realized that due to the imperfection and inaccuracy of the "technical innovation" slogan, the labor competition in many industrial and mining enterprises has been biased, and decided to stop using this slogan, which is necessary. But we must clearly recognize that stopping the use of the "technical innovation" slogan does not mean that we should not improve the technical level of industrial production; on the contrary, this is precisely to make the greatest efforts to truly, under leadership and planning, and effectively mobilize the broad masses of workers to actively learn technology, master and improve technology, especially to learn advanced science and technology from the Soviet Union (of course, there are also advanced science and technology from various people's democratic countries), and to promote advanced experience from the Soviet Union and our own country. Stopping the use of the "technical innovation" slogan does not mean that we should not improve the level of labor competition, but return to the kind of competition that relied solely on physical strength in the past; on the contrary, this is precisely to truly and effectively overcome the shortcomings of relying solely on physical strength, and to aim at practical production problems, unify the steps of various organizations in factories and mines, and work together to truly improve the level of labor competition. Stopping the use of the "technical innovation" slogan is also by no means a denial or restriction of the rationalization proposals and inventions of the masses; on the contrary, this is precisely to enable the rationalization proposals of the masses to be widely developed on the basis of improving the technical level of the broad masses of workers.
    It is hoped that the staff of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League in industrial and mining enterprises will earnestly summarize the experience and lessons of the past labor competition movement, promote the advantages, overcome the shortcomings, closely rely on the masses, earnestly learn from the Soviet Union, promote advanced experience, improve the level of production management, so that the labor competition movement can truly be widely, deeply, and persistently carried out, in order to comprehensively and better complete our country's industrial construction plan.

　　必须切实改进劳动竞赛
　　黎平
    在实现我国社会主义建设的进程中，劳动竞赛是发动广大劳动群众的积极性和创造性来完成我国伟大建设任务的重要方法。为着在工业上进一步挖掘生产潜力，更好地利用现有设备、生产场地和原材料，有力地开展增产节约运动，为着进一步改进工作方法，掌握新的技术，巩固劳动纪律，提高广大职工群众的政治文化技术水平，为着进一步推动生产均衡率的提高和生产管理的改善，并不断克服企业中的官僚主义现象，为着不断地提高劳动生产率，全面地完成国家计划的所有指标，都需要组织广大群众的劳动竞赛。
    中华人民共和国成立几年以来，我国工人阶级在共产党的领导下，展开了广泛的劳动竞赛运动，获得了显著的成绩。通过竞赛，许多厂矿有效地克服了困难，较好地完成了国家的生产和建设计划。通过竞赛，许多厂矿中涌现了大批的先进工作者，整个工人阶级也因此在政治上、技术上、文化上得到了提高。
    可是应当指出，由于我们劳动竞赛的一些组织者经验不足，向苏联学习不够，还由于种种客观原因，在过去几年的劳动竞赛过程中也曾产生过若干的盲目性。在一九五四年以前的几年中，我国厂矿里的劳动竞赛大部分多少是偏重拼体力、加强劳动强度的，这就造成了工人群众的过分劳累，而且对生产的作用也有限，从而使竞赛运动不能持久，也不能普及和提高。这种缺点在某种意义上说，是运动的一定发展阶段上所难于完全避免的。鉴于这种缺点，中华全国总工会曾在一九五四年接受了七个先进工作者的建议，提出了一个新的口号——“技术革新”，以此作为劳动竞赛的新阶段的主要内容。这种想把劳动竞赛提高一步、使它同提高技术结合起来的意图，是正确的。事实上，自从“技术革新”这一号召提出以来，确有不少职工注意了技术问题从而推进了合理化建议运动，帮助解决了生产上的某些技术问题，并部分克服了过去竞赛中单凭体力的缺点。在这个方面，技术革新运动是获得了一定的成绩的。可是这一运动还并没有十分现实地解决劳动竞赛和提高技术如何正确结合的问题，因而也还没有能够根本克服单凭体力的缺点，没有能够根本克服以往竞赛中的某些盲目性。不仅如此；由于这一运动的内容的不完善，不确切，不能包括最广大的群众，还产生了一些新的缺点和偏向，妨碍劳动竞赛的进一步开展和提高。因之，正确地总结过去的劳动竞赛的经验和教训，就成为当前进一步提高劳动竞赛的关键。
    从过去的劳动竞赛工作中，可以得出哪些主要的经验和教训呢？
    第一、劳动竞赛要能真正得到成功，必须使竞赛同学习、掌握先进技术，正确地结合起来；必须从职工群众的实际情况出发，发动广大群众的积极性去努力提高自己的政治文化技术水平，并在这一基础上切实地提高生产的技术水平。目前我国工业的共同性问题是品种少，质量低，成本高，原材料供应不足。这里除了客观的因素外，工业生产本身特别是重工业生产本身当前突出的问题是：产品技术要求高，而生产管理水平和技术水平则离要求很远。这几年来，一方面我国建设了许多近代化的工业企业，在原有企业中也增添了许多新的技术装备，这就要求有数量更多、质量更高的技术工人和技术人员去迅速地掌握新的技术装备，学会新的工作方法，以制造日益增多的新的品种；而另一方面，培养发展技术力量的工作还远赶不上我国工业迅速发展的需要，并且由于大批生手之涌入工人阶级队伍，职工的平均技术水平大大降低了。这样就形成了一个突出的、迫切要求解决的矛盾。要解决这个矛盾，首先必须切实地实现毛主席的指示，掀起学习苏联的热潮，实事求是地、老老实实地学习苏联先进经验（当然，学习苏联绝不是指仅仅技术方面的先进经验，而应当包含理论、科学、技术、组织、管理等各方面），同时必须有领导地、有计划地推广我国自己的行之有效的先进经验。必须把劳动竞赛同学习、掌握先进技术结合起来，必须把广大工人技术人员的积极性、创造性引导到具体地、有效地、适合情况地真正学会、掌握先进的生产技术的轨道上。为此，还必须同时切实提高广大职工的文化技术基本知识，因为只有提高这种基本知识的水平，才能使广大职工群众有条件去真正有效地掌握先进技术、推行先进经验，才能使推行先进经验成为广大群众的切实有效的改进生产的运动。这是我国厂矿的共同要求；当然对于不同情况的企业（如新建、改建和原有的种种企业），不同情况的工人和技术人员
  （如老工人、新工人，原有技术人员、新从学校毕业的或新从工人中提拔的技术人员等），还必须提出适合情况的具体要求。以往经验证明，凡是在劳动竞赛中，针对着职工群众的这种现实情况，提倡老老实实地学习苏联和我国的先进经验，提倡老老实实地学习技术、文化的，就能够切实提高广大职工群众的技术水平，就能够使他们真正学会和掌握新的技术，并有基础地、有目的地提出和推行合理化建议，就能够使职工群众真正广泛地参加竞赛运动，有效地提高生产的水平。这样，广大群众的积极性、创造性，也就能够不致流于浪费，而能真正产生伟大的效果。相反地，凡不是这样做的，效果就少，缺点就多。在技术革新运动中，某些厂矿就曾有过这样的毛病：他们没有切实提倡老老实实学习和推行苏联和我国的先进经验，而是主要地注意了革新技术的发明创造。可是发明创造虽可能有一定的群众性，究竟是比较少数人的事，大多数职工是不可能积极有效地参加进来的，在目前广大职工的文化技术水平很低的条件下尤其是如此，而劳动竞赛则是全体职工群众的事，因此，用“技术革新”作为广大群众性的劳动竞赛运动的主要内容是困难的和不适当的。为着进一步提高劳动竞赛，我们就必须针对我们工业中的基本弱点，把竞赛放在切实可靠的、有效的、持久的基础上，使劳动竞赛能够真正有助于解决我们工业上制造技术落后的这一基本问题，而真正成为提高生产水平的动力。
    第二、劳动竞赛要能真正得到成功，必须从当前工业特别是本企业的实际生产情况出发，提出适当的具体的竞赛目标。现在执行工业生产计划的主要问题，是许多企业常常不能全面地、均衡地完成国家计划的各项指标，许多企业只是偏重于产品数量指标的完成，而且就是在数量指标中也常常只是多顾到总产值的完成，而较少顾到商品数量指标的完成。至于完成新产品试制任务以扩大品种、提高产品质量、降低成本等这些主要指标，则大都没有给予应有的注意。在工业中固然有一般的共同的任务，但具体说来，不仅不同工业部门之间，并且就是在同一部门、同一专业的各个企业之间，甚至在一个企业的各个车间之间，都有各自生产的特点和关键问题。因此，在国家计划总的要求之下，按照各企业的具体生产特点和关键问题，来开展有正确目标的劳动竞赛，就成为竞赛是否能取得重大效果的另一重要环节。过去凡是按照这样正确做了的，竞赛就收到了较好的效果，企业的生产也就得到较多的进步。凡是没有按照这样正确去做的，竞赛虽表面上可以轰轰烈烈一阵，但实际效果却不会很大，有时甚至造成生产上的一些困难。在技术革新运动中，某些企业就有过这样的缺点。某些同志没有能够深入分析本企业的具体情况，把解决本企业生产的具体关键问题，加强本企业生产的薄弱环节，作为竞赛的现实目标，而机械地搬用鞍钢的经验，去一般地追求自动化、机械化，追求创造发明。这样，技术革新运动就同企业的现实生产需要相脱节，就不能获得竞赛的应有效果。为着进一步提高劳动竞赛，我们必须切实克服和防止上述这种脱离实际的偏向，真正根据各企业的具体生产情况，把解决生产关键问题，加强薄弱环节，全面地、均衡地完成生产计划的各项指标，当作为劳动竞赛的明确的目标。
    第三、劳动竞赛要能真正得到成功，必须是企业的统一行动，必须是企业内各个组织的共同战斗任务。正因为劳动竞赛是发扬先进、克服落后和反对官僚主义现象的重大斗争，是完成社会主义建设的伟大动力，所以企业中的各个组织必须充分开展批评和自我批评，努力实现各自在劳动竞赛中的责任，充分发挥各个组织对竞赛的应有的作用。例如说，党的组织应当在思想上、政治上给劳动竞赛以明确的方向，按照党中央的方针、政策，掌握广大职工群众的思想动态，及时发现和支持竞赛中的先进事物，纠正竞赛中的错误缺点，统一各组织的工作步调。行政组织应当在思想上明确认识劳动竞赛是依靠广大群众完成生产计划的基本方法，因之，不仅要使广大职工群众明确知道生产情况和关键问题，而且要给予劳动竞赛以应有的物质条件的支持，采取改进生产的有效的组织技术措施，采用先进技术，改进劳动组织，整顿、制定工艺规程与各项定额，在竞赛过程中不断改善生产管理方法，共同努力推进劳动竞赛的运动。行政组织同时还必须使行政工作人员积极参加劳动竞赛，使之成为运动的一个有机组织成分。工会组织应当在党的领导和行政的支持下深入地发动职工群众来进行切实有效的竞赛，同时还要正确地注意职工群众的经济文化利益，使国家总的利益同群众的切身利益密切结合起来。青年团应当发动广大青年工人来更好地参加竞赛。在以往的竞赛中，有些企业里的各个组织常常没有能够把工作步调统一起来，以致发生竞赛是竞赛，生产是生产，管理是管理，互相割裂甚至互相冲突的现象。这就当然使得竞赛不能得到应有的效果。这种现象，在技术革新运动中非但没有克服，而且在某些单位甚至更形发展了。为着进一步提高劳动竞赛，我们必须坚决克服这种互不结合，割裂分散的偏向，必须真正把劳动竞赛当作企业整体的共同战斗行动。
    最近全国总工会总结了一年来劳动竞赛的工作，认识到由于“技术革新”口号的不完善、不确切，以致影响好些工矿企业劳动竞赛发生一些偏向的情况，决定停用这一口号，这是必要的。但我们必须清楚认识：停用“技术革新”口号决不是说不要提高工业生产的技术水平；相反的，这正是为着要以最大的努力去真正有领导地、有计划地并且切实有效地发动广大职工群众积极学习技术，掌握和提高技术，特别是学习苏联的先进科学技术（当然还有各人民民主国家的先进科学技术），去推行苏联和我国自己的先进经验。停用“技术革新”口号决不是说不要提高劳动竞赛的水平，而回到过去单凭体力的那种竞赛上去；相反的，这正是为着真正有效地克服单凭体力的缺点，为着针对生产实际问题，统一厂矿内各种组织的步调，共同努力，去真正提高劳动竞赛的水平。停用“技术革新”口号也决不是对于群众的合理化建议和创造发明的否定或限制；相反的，这正是为着使群众的合理化建议能够在提高广大职工技术水平的基础上得到广泛的开展。
    希望工矿企业中的党、行政、工会和青年团的工作人员能够认真总结过去劳动竞赛运动的经验教训，发扬优点，克服缺点，紧密依靠群众，认真学习苏联，推行先进经验，提高生产管理水平，使劳动竞赛运动真正能够广泛地、深入地、持久地开展起来，以全面地、更好地完成我国的工业建设计划。
