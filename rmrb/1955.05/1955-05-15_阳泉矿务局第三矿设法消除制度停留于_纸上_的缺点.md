The Yangquan Mining Bureau No. 3 Mine convened a meeting of responsible personnel from relevant departments and units to discuss the short essay "Paper Systems" published in this newspaper on April 6th. The mine informed this newspaper in a letter dated April 16th that those attending the meeting unanimously agreed that the criticism raised by the newspaper was correct. In order to change the shortcomings of systems remaining "on paper," the mine decided to take some specific measures, such as transferring twelve of the more skilled coal chute drivers from the loading team to form a unified coal chute group, tasking the Mechanical and Electrical Department with drafting "Coal Chute Operating Procedures," regularly organizing coal chute workers to learn techniques, and strengthening business leadership; and implementing a fixed machine, piece-rate wage system for workers operating coal chute machines, etc., to ensure the implementation of the "three specials" system of dedicated personnel, dedicated responsibility, and dedicated machines to eliminate accidents. These specific improvement measures have been implemented since April 15th.

　　阳泉矿务局第三矿设法消除制度停留于“纸上”的缺点
    阳泉矿务局第三矿召开有关科室单位负责人员的会议讨论了本报四月六日发表的小品文“纸上制度”。该矿于四月十六日来信告诉本报，出席会议的人一致认为报纸提出的批评是正确的。为改变制度停留于“纸上”的缺点，该矿决定采取一些具体措施，如将较熟练的煤溜司机十二人由装车队调出，统一组成煤溜组，责成机电科订出“煤溜操作规程”，定期组织煤溜工人学习技术，加强业务领导；并实行开煤溜机器的工人固定机器，计件工资制，等等，以保证专人、专责、专机器的三专制度的贯彻执行，消灭事故。这些具体改进办法已自四月十五日开始实行。
