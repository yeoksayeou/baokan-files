Shanghai is strengthening the cooling work in workshops for the summer. The scale of cooling work in Shanghai's factories and enterprises this summer will be larger than in 1954. The city's state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and enterprises plan to spend 3 million yuan on cooling work this year. More than 200 factories have already started installing workshop cooling equipment. Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 2 has newly installed 14 high-speed atomizers and modified eight air shower devices. The Shanghai Wire Factory has added six high-speed atomizers to the bare wire rubber workshop alone. Various textile factories are carrying out maintenance of cooling equipment and other work.

In 1954, only more than 600 private factories in ten industries such as steel smelting, textile, dyeing, and glass implemented cooling measures in Shanghai. This year, the implementation of cooling measures will be expanded to more than 1,000 factories in twenty-two industries such as cigarettes, electrical equipment, towel sheets, and machinery. At present, some private factories have already formulated cooling plans and started installing cooling equipment, while others are in the process of formulating cooling plans. It is expected that the installation of cooling equipment and other work in these private factories can be completed by the end of June.

　  上海加强夏季车间降温工作
    上海市工厂企业今年夏季车间降温工作的规模将比一九五四年扩大，全市国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂企业，今年计划用于降温工作的费用有三百万元。现在已经有二百多个工厂开始装置车间降温设备。上海钢铁二厂已经新装置十四架高速喷雾器，改装了八具空气淋浴设备。上海电线厂仅裸线橡皮车间就增加了六架高速喷雾器。各纺织厂正在进行检修降温设备等工作。
    上海市私营工厂，一九五四年只有钢铁冶制、纺织、染织、玻璃等十个行业的六百多户实行降温，今年实行降温的将扩大到卷烟、电工器材、毛巾被单、机器等二十二个行业的一千多家工厂。目前，一部分私营工厂已经订出降温计划，开始装置降温设备，一部分正在订降温计划。预计这些私营工厂的装置降温设备等工作，可在六月底全部完成。
