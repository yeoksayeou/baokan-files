　　German Communist Party Central Committee Issues Statement on Current Political Situation
　　Proposes Five-Point Plan for Restoring German Unity
      Xinhua News Agency, Dusseldorf, May 13th -- According to a report by the German News Agency: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party has issued a statement on the current political situation.
    The statement pointed out that since the Paris Agreements have come into effect and Adenauer has brought West Germany into the US military treaty bloc, the path to the peaceful reunification of Germany has been obstructed. Everyone now recognizes that the path of the Paris Agreements is not a path to unity, peace, and independence, but a path to long-term foreign occupation and long-term division.
    The statement said: The German Communist Party believes that, in light of the current developments, it is necessary to put forward the following proposals regarding the position Germany should take:
      (1) Germany can only become a peaceful country by abolishing the Paris Agreements. The conditions under which Austria gained freedom and independence should also apply to Germany, namely: not to participate in military treaties and not to allow the establishment of foreign military bases on German territory.
    (2) The unification of Germany should primarily be a matter for the Germans themselves. Germany's position should not be decided by Bonn and Washington, but should be decided through an agreement between Bonn and Berlin.
    (3) The first goal of all-German talks must be to reach an understanding on the elimination of militarism and the establishment of an all-German National Assembly through free all-German elections.
    (4) The all-German government produced by the all-German National Assembly should immediately conclude a peace treaty.
      (5) The security of the German and all European peoples should be guaranteed through the establishment of a pan-European collective security system. Until Germany is reunified, East and West Germany will participate in this collective security system as equal member states.
    The statement said: This proposal for restoring German unity will become the basis for joint cooperation among all those who oppose Adenauer and all those who hope that Germany will embark on the path of peace and freedom.

　　德共中央就目前的政治局势发表声明
　　提出恢复德国统一的五点建议
      新华社柏林十三日电　据德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫消息：德国共产党中央委员会书记处就目前的政治局势发表了一项声明。
    声明指出，由于巴黎战争协定已经生效，阿登纳已经使西德加入了美国的军事条约集团，这样，就阻碍了和平统一德国的道路。每一个人现在都认识到：巴黎协定的道路并不是走向统一、和平和独立的道路，而是走向长期的外国占领和长期的分裂的道路。
    声明说：德国共产党认为，鉴于目前形势的发展，必须就德国所应采取的立场提出下列建议：
      （一）只有废除巴黎协定，德国才能成为一个和平的国家。奥地利获得自由和独立的条件对德国也应该适用，即：不得参加军事条约，不得允许在德国的土地上建立外国军事基地。
    （二）德国的统一应该首先是德国人自己的事。德国的立场不能由波恩和华盛顿决定，而应该通过波恩和柏林的协议决定。
    （三）全德会谈的第一个目标必须就肃清军国主义和举行全德自由选举建立全德国民议会的问题取得谅解。
    （四）由全德国民议会所产生的全德政府应该立即缔结和约。
      （五）通过建立全欧集体安全体系来保障德国和所有欧洲国家的人民的安全。在德国恢复统一以前，东西德国将作为平等的成员国参加这个集体安全体系。
    声明说：这个恢复德国统一的建议将成为一切反对阿登纳的人以及一切希望德国走上和平和自由的道路的人共同合作的基础。
