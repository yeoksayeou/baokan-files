The members of the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ningyang County, Shandong Province, are currently digging wells to turn dry land into irrigated land. This year, they plan to dig thirty-two wells. They have already dug the dry shafts for fifteen wells and are now carrying out tasks such as digging the wells deeper and bricklaying. For the forty old wells from last year, they are also leveling the land and reinforcing the irrigation ditches to increase the utilization rate of the wells. This year, the irrigated land area of ​​this cooperative will expand from more than 290 mu last year to more than 500 mu, and it is estimated that it can increase grain production by more than 54,000 jin throughout the year. The wells that have now been repaired have irrigated 250 mu of wheat, and some wheat fields have begun to be irrigated for the second time.

　  红旗农业合作社扩大水浇地
    山东宁阳县红旗农业生产合作社的社员们，目前正在打井，把旱地变为水地。今年他们计划打井三十二眼，现已挖好十五眼水井的旱筒，正进行掏井、砌砖等工作。对去年的四十眼旧水井，也作好平整土地、垫好水沟等工作，以提高水井利用率。今年这个社的水浇地面积将从去年二百九十多亩扩大到五百多亩，预计全年可增产粮食五万四千多斤。现在修好的水井已浇麦二百五十亩，有的麦地并开始浇二遍水。
