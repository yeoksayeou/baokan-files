Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: The International Commission for Vietnam, established in accordance with the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam" signed in Geneva on July 20, 1954, has submitted its first and second reports to the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference – the Soviet Union and Great Britain. These two reports describe the implementation of the aforementioned agreement and the work of the International Commission for Vietnam up to February 10, 1955. These two reports have recently been distributed by the governments of the Soviet Union and Great Britain to the participating countries of the Geneva Conference.

The report states that the ceasefire throughout Vietnam has been achieved in accordance with the armistice agreement. Both sides have also carried out the repatriation of prisoners of war and civilians. After the French side completely withdraws from the Haiphong area and the Vietnamese side completely withdraws from the temporary garrison areas in central Vietnam by mid-May of this year, the work of gathering the Vietnamese armistice parties on both sides of the temporary military demarcation line in Vietnam will also be completed.

The report condemns the French side’s continuous killing and persecution of civilians in central and southern Vietnam, pointing out that these actions by the French side violate Article 14(c) and Article 15(d) of the Vietnam Armistice Agreement, and demands that the French side punish those responsible. The report also states that the International Commission for Vietnam, at the request of the Vietnamese side, sent an international team to Con Dao to investigate the Vietnamese side's accusations against the French side for illegally detaining Vietnamese civilians. The investigation found that the French side had indeed failed to release and repatriate the detained Vietnamese civilians in accordance with the provisions of the Vietnam Armistice Agreement. Therefore, the International Commission demanded that the French side immediately release and repatriate those Vietnamese civilians who were still being illegally detained, but the French side did not comply with this request.

The report also mentions that before the French withdrawal from Hanoi, the International Commission for Vietnam received letters from various sources, including many workers in Hanoi, accusing and charging the French side with illegally destroying and looting public property in Hanoi. In order to urge the French side to fulfill its obligations under the armistice agreement not to destroy or arbitrarily damage any public property in the areas it withdrew from, the International Commission for Vietnam specifically dispatched an international team to Hanoi to carry out on-the-spot supervision. The report specifically points out that the handover of Haiphong should be carried out in strict accordance with the provisions of the Vietnam Armistice Agreement, and there should be no further destruction or arbitrary damage to public property, or infringement on the lives and property of the people.

Regarding the French side's illegal transportation of military personnel and materials, the report states that the International Commission is conducting an investigation into this matter.

The report also mentions the issue of civilians in one side's military control area being able to move to the other side's military control area voluntarily within the 300-day period after the Vietnam Armistice Agreement came into effect. The report states that the International Commission for Vietnam expressed concern about this issue and made specific suggestions to the Vietnamese armistice parties on simplifying the procedures for those requesting to relocate. The committee felt that the Vietnamese side should make some improvements in simplifying the procedures, but the committee did not find evidence to support certain accusations by the French side that the Vietnamese side was forcibly preventing North Vietnamese civilians from moving south during its investigation. The report also states that the International Commission for Vietnam has received accusations from various sources, especially from many residents in North Vietnam, regarding the French side luring and even coercing North Vietnamese civilians to move south, and the commission is conducting an investigation into this accusation.

The report concludes by pointing out that for the effective implementation of the Geneva Agreements, both sides must cooperate closely with each other and provide as much assistance and cooperation as possible to the International Commission and its teams in carrying out their tasks. The report believes that the cooperation between the International Commission and the two sides is not satisfactory enough. The report also mentions that due to the attitude of the Ngo Dinh Diem government, the French side has failed to implement the decisions of the International Commission several times. The report also expresses dissatisfaction with the fact that some local authorities on both sides sometimes did not provide the international teams with sufficient working facilities.

Summary of the Report by the International Commission for Laos

Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: The International Commission for Laos, established in accordance with the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos" signed in Geneva on July 20, 1954, has recently submitted its first report to the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference – the Soviet Union and Great Britain. The report describes the implementation of the aforementioned agreement and the work of the International Commission for Laos up to the end of 1954. This report has been distributed by the governments of the Soviet Union and Great Britain to the participating countries of the Geneva Conference.

The report believes that the most serious difficulty encountered in implementing the armistice agreement is that some provisions of the agreement are not clear enough, and the long-term civil war inevitably leads to differences between the two sides. However, despite this, both sides have made genuine efforts to fulfill the main obligations regarding the military aspects of the armistice agreement. They are willing to listen to the commission's opinions and provide the commission with all necessary cooperation and assistance.

The report points out that some military clauses of the Lao Armistice Agreement have been implemented. The Vietnamese volunteer personnel who were originally in Laos have all withdrawn from Laos on schedule. The Lao People's Liberation Army has also concentrated all its forces in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, as stipulated in the armistice agreement, within the prescribed time limit. Except for the 5,000 personnel allowed to remain under the armistice agreement, the French troops in Laos have also withdrawn from Laos.

The report believes that the most delicate and difficult issue currently in Laos is the issue of the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly. The report describes the process and results of the international team's dozens of investigations in the two provinces. The report affirmed that the French-Lao side had airdropped personnel and supplies in areas such as Ou Neua and Ou Tai in the two provinces after the armistice, and that the armed forces commanded or controlled by the French-Lao side had attacked strongholds of the Lao People's Liberation Army and looted peaceful residents in the two provinces. The report also demanded that the French-Lao side punish those responsible for these violations of the agreement. On the other hand, the report points out that during its investigations, the international team did not find any evidence to support the French-Lao side's accusations that the Vietnamese-Lao side had attacked the Lao Royal Army. The report concludes by stating that the tension in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly is increasing, and it hopes that the Lao parties will not engage in any actions in the two provinces that could lead to conflict.

The report also mentions that the French-Lao side has repeatedly accused the Vietnamese-Lao side of forcibly "conscripting" people in the areas it withdrew from and taking them to Vietnam or the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly in Laos. The report lists more than a dozen investigations conducted by the international team, on a randomly selected basis, in many locations throughout Laos, regarding these accusations. The results of the investigations proved that the French-Lao side's accusations were unfounded. The report also states that, as of the end of 1954, the French-Lao side had accused the Vietnamese volunteer personnel of not having completely withdrawn from Laos within the prescribed time limit on five occasions. The International Commission conducted a random check on one of these five accusations and found no Vietnamese volunteer personnel in the location where the French-Lao side claimed that Vietnamese volunteer personnel remained.

The report states that the International Commission for Laos hopes to establish a satisfactory system for supervising the entry of military personnel and materials into Laos as soon as possible.

Summary of the Report by the International Commission for Cambodia

Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: The International Commission for Cambodia, established in accordance with the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Cambodia" signed in Geneva on July 20, 1954, has submitted its first report to the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference – the Soviet Union and Great Britain. The report describes the implementation of the aforementioned agreement and the work of the International Commission for Cambodia up to the end of 1954. This report has been distributed by the governments of the Soviet Union and Great Britain to the participating countries of the Geneva Conference.

The report points out that both sides had implemented the military clauses of the Cambodian Armistice Agreement by October 20, 1954. The Khmer Resistance Forces had all been demobilized as scheduled by August 22, 1954. The Vietnamese volunteer personnel in Cambodia had also withdrawn from Cambodia by October 15, 1954, which was five days earlier than the prescribed deadline. As for the French troops originally in Cambodia, except for a military mission and some army and navy officers, they had all left Cambodia. In addition, the work of both sides releasing prisoners of war and detained civilians has also been basically completed.

The report emphasizes that the Royal Government of Cambodia has not well implemented the political clauses stipulated for Cambodia in the Geneva Agreements. The International Commission for Cambodia gave the Royal Government a memorandum on September 29, 1954, pointing out that the Royal Government had not taken the "effective measures" mentioned in Article 6 of the Cambodian Armistice Agreement to unite all Cambodian citizens in a common life. The committee hoped that the Royal Government would announce its generous and non-discriminatory policy to the whole country. Although the Royal Government of Cambodia issued an amnesty decree after receiving this memorandum from the International Commission for Cambodia, the International Commission considered this amnesty decree to be unsatisfactory, as it did not cover as broad a scope as it should have, and therefore raised objections to the Royal Government. At the same time, the International Commission for Cambodia also expressed unease about the news from various parts of Cambodia regarding the arrest of former Khmer Resistance personnel. The conclusion reached by the committee in the report is that the work of reuniting the former Khmer Resistance personnel in the common life of the country is far from complete, and the committee regards this issue as a top priority and is discussing it with the Royal Government of Cambodia and seeking a satisfactory solution.

The report points out some uncooperative attitudes taken by the Royal Government of Cambodia towards the International Commission for Cambodia, and believes that due to this attitude of the Royal Government, the International Commission has encountered difficulties in carrying out its work.

The report mentions that the International Commission for Cambodia has investigated accusations that the Khmer Resistance personnel have not all been demobilized, and that some Khmer Resistance personnel hid weapons when they were demobilized for future rebellion, but found no evidence to support these accusations. The International Commission has also made every effort to investigate the matter of a large number of Vietnamese volunteer personnel remaining in Cambodia, and has not found any armed forces of former Vietnamese volunteer personnel still in Cambodia.

The report specifically points out that the three commissioners of the International Commission for Cambodia are in full harmony when carrying out their common tasks. The main tasks of the commission in the future are: (1) To enable the demobilized former Khmer Resistance personnel to reunite in the common life of the country with the guarantee that they will not be retaliated against and will enjoy various civil rights. (2) To continue to supervise the entry of military personnel and military materials into Cambodia. (3) To pay attention to whether the Royal Government of Cambodia complies with the regulations regarding it not allowing foreign countries to establish military bases in Cambodia and not participating in military alliances. (4) To observe whether the Royal Government of Cambodia implements its declaration that all citizens will enjoy democratic rights and be able to participate in the elections in the general election in 1955.

　　向日内瓦会议主席国提出报告
　　越南国际委员会报告的摘要
    新华社三日讯　根据一九五四年七月二十日在日内瓦签订的“关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定”而成立的越南国际委员会已先后向日内瓦会议两主席国——苏联和英国提出了该委员会第一次和第二次报告。这两个报告叙述了截至一九五五年二月十日止上述协定的实施情况和越南国际委员会的工作。这两个报告最近已由苏、英两国政府分送日内瓦会议的参加国。
    报告中说：越南全境的停火业已按照停战协定实现。双方并进行了遣返战俘和平民的工作。到今年五月中旬法方完全撤出海防区和越方完全撤出中越临时驻扎地段以后，越南停战双方分别在越南临时军事分界线两侧集结的工作也将完成。
    报告谴责法方在中越、南越不断屠杀和迫害平民的行为，指出法方这些行为违反了越南停战协定第十四条丙款和第十五条丁款，并要求法方惩办有关人员。报告中还提出：越南国际委员会曾应越方要求派出国际小组前往昆仑岛，就越方对法方非法扣留越方被拘平民的指控进行了调查，结果发现法方确未按照越南停战协定的规定释放并遣返越方的被拘平民，因此国际委员会要求法方立即释放并遣返那些仍被非法扣留的越方被拘平民，但是法方对此项要求并未照办。
    报告还提到：在法方撤出河内前，越南国际委员会曾从各方面，包括河内的许多工人在内，收到检举和指控法方在河内非法破坏和劫走公共财产的信。为了督促法方在它所撤出的地区履行其按照停战协定不得破坏和不得任意毁坏任何公共财产的义务，越南国际委员会曾特地派遣国际小组到河内实行就地监督。报告并特别指出：海防的移交应该严格按照越南停战协定的规定执行，不应该再有任何破坏和任意毁坏公共财产、或侵犯人民的生命和财产的情事发生。
    关于法方非法运进军事人员和物资一事，报告表示：国际委员会正就此进行调查中。
    报告并提到在越南停战协定生效后的三百天期限内，一方军事控制地区的平民可以根据自愿而迁往另一方军事控制地区的问题。报告中说，越南国际委员会对此问题表示关心，并已向越南停战双方就简化要求迁居者办理迁居手续提出了具体建议。委员会觉得越方在简化手续方面还应该有所改进，但关于法方说越方强制阻挠北越平民南迁的某些指控，委员会在调查中并未发现证据。报告并说：越南国际委员会曾自各方面，特别是从北越的许多居民处，收到关于法方诱骗乃至于胁迫北越平民南迁的指控，该委员会正就此项指控进行调查中。
    报告最后指出：为有效实施日内瓦协议，双方必须彼此密切合作，并在国际委员会及其小组执行任务时尽量给予协助和合作。报告认为国际委员会和双方间的合作还不够满意。报告并提到：由于吴庭艳政府的态度，法方曾几次没有执行国际委员会的决定。报告还对双方某些地方当局有时并没有给予国际小组以充分的工作便利表示不满。
　　老挝国际委员会报告的摘要
    新华社三日讯　根据一九五四年七月二十日在日内瓦签订的“关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定”而成立的老挝国际委员会，最近向日内瓦会议两主席国——苏联和英国提出了该委员会的第一次报告。报告叙述了截至一九五四年底为止上述协定的实施情况和老挝国际委员会的工作。这个报告已由苏、英两国政府分送日内瓦会议的参加国。
    报告认为：实施停战协定的过程中所遭遇到的最严重的困难是：协定的某些规定不够明确，而长期的内战又必然使双方之间存在着分歧。但是，尽管如此，双方也还是作了真正的努力来履行关于停战协定的军事方面的主要义务。他们愿意听取委员会的意见，并给予委员会以各种必要的合作和协助。
    报告指出：老挝停战协定的某些军事条款业已实施。原在老挝的越南志愿人员已如期全部撤出老挝。寮国战斗部队也已在规定期限内全部集结到停战协定所规定的桑怒、丰沙里两省。法国在老挝的部队，除停战协定所允许留下的五千人外，也已撤出老挝。
    报告认为：老挝当前最微妙、最困难的问题就是桑怒和丰沙里两省的问题。报告叙述了国际小组在两省进行了数十次调查的经过和结果。报告肯定了法国—老挝方曾在停战后在两省乌怒、乌西等地空投人员和物资，而法国—老挝方所指挥或控制的武装力量曾进攻寮国战斗部队的据点，劫掠两省的和平居民。报告并要求法国—老挝方惩办这些违反协定事件的有关人员。另一方面，报告指出国际小组在历次调查中均未发现任何证据足以证实法国—老挝方所提出的越—寮方曾进攻老挝王国部队的指控。报告最后表示：桑怒和丰沙里两省的紧张局势正在增加，希望老挝双方在两省不进行任何足以引起冲突的行动。
    报告并提到：法国—老挝方曾一再指控越—寮方在它撤出的地区强制“抓丁”，带往越南或老挝的桑怒和丰沙里两省。报告列举了国际小组在任意选择的基础上，在遍及老挝全国的许多地点，就这一类指控所进行的十几次调查，调查结果证明了法国—老挝方的指控不能成立。报告并说：截至一九五四年底止，法国—老挝方曾五次指控越南志愿人员没有在规定期限内全部撤出老挝。国际委员会曾就这五次指控中的一次进行了抽查，结果在法国—老挝方指称仍留有越南志愿人员的地点并没有发现任何越南志愿人员。
    报告表示：老挝国际委员会希望能够尽速在监督军事人员和物资进入老挝方面建立一个令人满意的制度。
　　柬埔寨国际委员会报告的摘要
    新华社三日讯　根据一九五四年七月二十日在日内瓦签订的“关于在柬埔寨停止敌对行动的协定”而成立的柬埔寨国际委员会，已经向日内瓦会议两主席国——苏联和英国提出了该委员会的第一次报告。报告叙述了截至一九五四年底为止上述协定的实施情况和柬埔寨国际委员会的工作。这个报告业已由苏、英两国政府分送日内瓦会议的参加国。
    报告指出：双方已在一九五四年十月二十日以前执行了柬埔寨停战协定的军事条款。高棉抗战部队已如期在一九五四年八月二十二日以前全部复员。在高棉的越南志愿人员也已在一九五四年十月十五日以前，即较规定的期限早五天，撤出了柬埔寨。至于法国原在柬埔寨的军队，则除留下一军事使团和一些陆海军军官外，均已离开柬埔寨。此外，双方释放战俘和被拘平民的工作也已基本上完成。
    报告着重地提出：柬埔寨王国政府并没有很好地执行日内瓦协议中对柬埔寨所规定的政治性条款。柬埔寨国际委员会曾于一九五四年九月二十九日给王国政府一个备忘录，指出王国政府并没有采取柬埔寨停战协定第六条所提到的“有效措施”来把全体柬埔寨公民团结在共同生活中。委员会希望王国政府向全国宣布其宽大的不歧视的政策。柬埔寨王国政府在收到柬埔寨国际委员会这一备忘录后虽然颁布了大赦令，但是国际委员会认为这个大赦令不能令人满意，它所包括的范围并没有做到理所应有的广泛，因此曾向王国政府提出异议。与此同时，柬埔寨国际委员会并对来自柬埔寨各地关于前高棉抗战人员被逮捕的消息表示不安。委员会在报告中所作的结论是：把前高棉抗战人员重新团结在全国共同生活中的工作远未完成，委员会把这一问题当作是头等的问题，正就此同柬埔寨王国政府讨论并寻求一个满意的解决办法。
    报告指出了柬埔寨王国政府对柬埔寨国际委员会所采取的某些不合作的态度，并认为由于王国政府的这种态度，国际委员会在进行工作时曾遭遇到困难。
    报告提到：柬埔寨国际委员会业已调查了关于高棉抗战人员并未全部复员、以及关于有些高棉抗战人员在复员时把武器藏起来供将来叛乱之用的指控，结果没有发现任何证据足以证实这些指控。国际委员会并已尽一切努力对所谓仍有大量越南志愿人员留在柬埔寨一事进行了调查，结果并未发现在柬埔寨仍有前越南志愿人员的武装部队。
    报告特别指出：柬埔寨国际委员会三国委员在执行其共同任务时是十分和谐的。今后委员会的主要任务是：（一）使复员的前高棉抗战人员在保证他们不受报复并享有各种公民权利的情况下重新团结在全国共同生活中。（二）继续在军事人员和军事物资的进入柬埔寨方面进行监督。（三）注意柬埔寨王国政府是否遵守关于它不许外国在柬埔寨建立军事基地和不参加军事联盟的规定。（四）观察柬埔寨王国政府实施它关于在一九五五年的普选中全体公民都享有民主权利并都能参加选举的声明。
