　　Enhance Workers' Socialist Consciousness Through Regular Anti-Waste Struggle
　　An Gang
　　Whenever anti-waste is mentioned, many enterprise leaders and staff members think it is a "routine event," something "to be done every year," and "just a passing wave; once it's over, it's done." Although they admit, "it's always better to combat waste than not," they say that "combating waste cannot solve the fundamental problems of the factory." The "big problems" in their minds are only "production preparation," "planned management," and "technical management," as if combating waste has no direct relationship to overall production management.

　　Needless to say, these enterprise leaders and staff members are not truly familiar with the actual situation of their factories. If you were to ask them how much capital is actually tied up in inventory, how much material is lying dormant in the warehouse, how much new equipment is being worn down, how much usable material is scattered and hidden above and below ground in the factory, they probably wouldn't know any of it. In this situation, they naturally wouldn't deeply feel the serious significance of the anti-waste struggle.

　　Many serious instances of waste can only be exposed through mass revelation. Party organizations and administrative departments should organize the masses to meticulously inspect all instances of waste, find the root causes of the waste, and formulate effective measures to eliminate it. According to Comrade Li Yilin, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Shenyang Wire Factory, the Party Committee organized an inspection team in February to check for waste in the factory. At that time, everyone felt that there was waste in the factory, but no major problems. Later, the Party branch of the guard platoon mobilized the guards to look for wasted materials in the factory compound. In two months, they found ten tons of coal, 20,835 kilograms of iron, 4,639 kilograms of copper, 569 kilograms of aluminum, and other materials worth a total of 10,200 yuan.

　　Based on the anti-waste achievements of the guard platoon comrades, the Shenyang Wire Factory Party Committee put forward the slogan of cherishing "every inch of iron," further mobilizing all personnel to check for waste and guiding everyone to search for and inspect materials abandoned underground. A comrade from the engineering section discovered five steel plates, four feet wide, eight feet long, and ten millimeters thick, in the soil. The Shenyang Wire Factory's anti-waste struggle gained even greater momentum. The situation at the Shenyang Wire Factory tells us that the anti-waste struggle generally only uncovers some superficial instances of waste at the beginning. At this time, leaders must never think that these are just "trivialities" and call it quits. They should further encourage the masses to delve deeper. As long as the masses are mobilized, it is possible to find major waste "from small to large."

　　The Party organization should not look at the problem from the perspective of the value of the waste, but should look at the problem politically, viewing it as an expression of irresponsibility towards state property; and through the analysis of these instances of waste, raise people's awareness of cherishing state property. For example, the Shenyang Wire Factory found ten tons of coal underground. From a value perspective, the value of coal is indeed much smaller than that of ten tons of steel; however, this wasn't just a few dozen or a few hundred pounds, but ten tons of coal. People actually couldn't see that ten tons of coal had been abandoned to the side, which shockingly exposed the attitude of some people in the wire factory towards state property. After investigation, the Shenyang Wire Factory Party Committee discovered that the coal had been placed in a depression. Over time, the coal filled the pit, and people forgot about it. Why is it that no matter how much money accumulates in one's own pocket, it's never forgotten, but they are so forgetful about the coal that was transported in truckload after truckload to fill the pit every day? The responsibility of the Party organization's political work is to study and cure this "forgetfulness disease." It is a special ideological symptom, a manifestation of a lack of a communist attitude towards state public property and a lack of enthusiasm for socialist construction. Wherever this disease is prevalent, not only will the phenomenon of abandoning coal occur, but wires, steel, and all kinds of valuable materials will inevitably be abandoned as well.

　　A lesson worth noting is that many factories have repeatedly launched anti-waste campaigns, and each campaign supposedly experienced a "climax" or a "high tide," but "underground treasures" were never discovered. This is because the leaders of the factories are often satisfied with generally arranging anti-waste campaigns and making general appeals at large meetings. As soon as someone in the masses starts moving, they are immediately called "basically mobilized" and "a high tide has formed," thus abandoning in-depth leadership of the movement. These words of praise have played a role in stifling the movement in many places. Anti-waste is also a serious ideological struggle, and meticulous and in-depth ideological work must be carried out. For example, some people verbally agree to anti-waste, but when they encounter the waste of a lot of equipment buried underground, they have doubts about whether this counts as waste. Someone might say, "This thing isn't needed, it's just in the wrong place, it doesn't count as waste." Another might also say, "This is waste, but it has nothing to do with our factory, the higher-ups allocated it incorrectly! The higher-ups reduced the plan!" and so on. The important task of the anti-waste struggle is to use socialist thought to answer these erroneous ideas and make them ask themselves, "Have you protected these state materials?" "State materials have turned into garbage in your factory, can you say it's someone else's responsibility?" They must recognize their responsibility to the state, examine their thoughts, and call on them to actively join the struggle. In the past, anti-waste campaigns often swept through like a gust of wind. Some people, under the guise of beautiful phrases such as "basically mobilized" and "high tide formed," quietly evaded the struggle, which prevented the anti-waste struggle from developing in depth.

　　The main obstacle to the development of the anti-waste struggle is often due to the fact that some Party organizations and administrative leading cadres do not understand that the anti-waste struggle is a decisive link in the realization of socialist enterprise management in factories. We cannot imagine that a socialist factory would be one where waste is rampant. The socialist nature of our factories dictates that everyone engaged in production must work with a communist attitude, must cherish every penny and every piece of iron of the state, and accumulate socialist construction funds for the state in every way. Everyone should regard every penny and every piece of iron in the factory as the concrete interests of the state's socialist construction. If this cannot be done, it cannot be called a truly socialist factory, nor can it be called a truly communist labor attitude. Leading staff members of factories and mines should set their own exemplary examples in this regard.

　　Party organizations and administrative organizations of factories and mines should take anti-waste as their regular work task, analyze the ideological roots from the phenomenon of waste, strictly criticize wasteful thinking in principle, eliminate the idea in people's minds that "the factory is big and the business is big, wasting a little is nothing," and replace it with the idea of diligently cherishing every inch of iron and every penny of the state, accumulating funds and reducing costs for the state, and implementing maximum economy. Many factories usually turn a blind eye to waste, and when it is discovered, they simply punish one or two responsible persons and let it go. This is not right. Party organizations must never take a bystander's tolerant attitude towards all instances of waste in the factory. It should be known that protecting state property and preventing it from being damaged in the slightest is by no means a matter of experience or ability, but the duty of everyone in the factory and a matter of communist labor attitude. One of the tasks of the Party organization is to improve the communist consciousness of everyone through a regular and sustained anti-waste struggle. It is necessary to seriously investigate the causes of waste, conduct ideological criticism, and launch a struggle until the phenomenon of waste is completely eliminated.

　　通过经常性的反浪费斗争，提高职工的社会主义觉悟
　　安岗
    一提起反浪费，不少企业领导工作人员都以为这是“例行大事”，“年年要反一下”的，“这不过是一股子浪头，赶过去，就完事”。他们虽然承认：“反一下总是比不反好”，可是他们说“反浪费解决不了工厂的根本问题”。他们心目中的“大问题”只有：“生产准备工作”“计划管理”“技术管理”等，好像反浪费同整个生产管理没有直接关系。
    不用问，这些企业领导工作人员并没有真正熟悉本工厂的实际情况，你要是问他账面上倒底积压了多少资金？仓库里有多少材料躺着睡觉？有多少新式设备被磨损？工厂的地上地下散着和潜伏着多少可用的物资？这一切他很可能都不知道。在这种情况下，当然也就不会深切感到反浪费斗争的严重意义。
    许多严重浪费现象，只有经过群众的揭发才能被暴露出来。党组织和行政部门应当组织群众细致地检查一切浪费现象，找出发生浪费现象的根本原因，制定有效措施，消灭浪费现象。据沈阳电线厂党委书记李艺林同志谈，党委曾在二月份组织检查组检查工厂有没有浪费现象。当时大家只觉得工厂有浪费现象，但没有大的问题。后来工厂警卫班党支部发动警卫人员在工厂院内找浪费的物资，两个月的时间，找到了煤十吨、铁二万零八百三十五公斤、铜四千六百三十九公斤、铝五百六十九公斤，以及其他物资等共值一万零二百元。
    沈阳电线厂党委会又根据警卫班同志反浪费的成果，提出了爱护“一寸铁”的口号，进一步发动全体人员去检查浪费现象，引导大家去搜索和检查废弃在地下的材料。工程科一位同志在土里发现了五块四尺宽、八尺长、十公厘厚的钢板。电线厂的反浪费的斗争劲头更大了。电线厂的情况告诉我们，反浪费斗争在开始时一般只能找到一些表面上的浪费现象，这时领导方面绝不要以为它是一些“鸡毛蒜皮”的东西而就收兵，应当进一步鼓励群众深入发掘。只要发动了群众，就可以做到“由小到大”找到大的浪费。
    党组织不应该从浪费的价值大小来看问题，而应该从政治上来看问题，把这看做是对国家财产不负责任的表现；并通过对这些浪费现象的分析，提高人们爱护国家财产的观念。譬如电线厂从地下找到十吨煤，从价值上看，煤比起十吨钢铁的价值确是小的多；可是，这不是几十斤或是几百斤而是十吨煤，人们居然看不到有十吨煤被废弃在一边，这就惊人地暴露了电线厂某些人对国家财产的态度。电线厂党委会调查后，发现这些煤是被放在一个洼坑内，日久天长煤把坑给填平了，于是人们就把这些煤给忘记了。为什么自己口袋中的钱积得再多也忘不了，而对这些天天一车一车运进来填平了坑的煤就这么健忘呢？党组织政治工作的责任，就是要研究和医治这一种“健忘病”。它是一个特殊的思想病症，是对国家公共财产缺乏共产主义态度、缺乏社会主义建设热情的表现。凡是这种病症流行的地方，那里不但会发生废弃煤的现象，而且必然会废弃电线、钢铁以及各式各样贵重物资。
    值得我们注意的一个教训是，很多工厂曾经是一再掀起反浪费的运动，每次运动据说都曾出现过
  “高潮”或是“热潮”，可是总发现不了“地下宝藏”。这是因为工厂的领导者常常只满足于一般地布置反浪费运动，开大会作一般号召。群众中刚一有人动起来，立刻就被称之为“基本上发动起来了”，已经“形成热潮”了，因而放弃了对运动的深入领导。这种赞美的语句在不少地方都起了绞杀运动的作用。反浪费也是一场严重的思想斗争，必须进行细致深入的思想工作。譬如有些人在口头上同意反浪费，可是碰到很多器材被埋在地下的浪费现象，他们就发生了这算不算浪费的疑问，有人说：“这个东西用不着，只是放的地方不对，算不得浪费。”另一个也可能说：“这是浪费，可是同我们工厂没有关系，上级调拨的不对啊！上级削减了计划啊！”等等论调，不一而足。反浪费斗争的重要任务，就是要用社会主义思想来回答这些错误思想，使他们反问自己：“你保护过这些国家物资吗？”
  “国家物资在你们工厂变成了垃圾，能够说是别人的责任吗？”要让他们认识自己对国家应负的责任，检查思想，并号召他们积极起来投入斗争。过去的反浪费运动常常像一阵风似的刮过去。有些人在“基本发动”、“形成热潮”等美丽词句的掩盖下悄悄地逃避了斗争，这就使反浪费斗争，不能深入发展。
    反浪费斗争开展不起来的主要障碍，常常是由于某些党组织和行政领导干部不了解反浪费斗争是实现工厂社会主义企业管理的一个决定的环节。我们不可能设想一个社会主义的工厂会是一个浪费现象层出不穷的工厂。我们工厂的社会主义性质，决定了每个从事生产的人都必须以共产主义的态度进行工作，必须爱护国家每一分钱、每一块铁，从一切方面来为国家积累社会主义建设资金。人人都应当把工厂的每一分钱、每一块铁都看作是国家社会主义建设的具体利益。如果做不到这点，就不能叫做名符其实的社会主义工厂，也不能叫做名符其实的共产主义的劳动态度。厂矿企业的领导工作人员在这一方面应当树立自己的模范榜样。
    厂矿企业党组织和行政组织要把反浪费作为自己经常的工作任务，要从浪费现象中分析思想根源，从原则上严格批判浪费思想，肃清人们思想中的“工厂家大业大，浪费一点没啥”的想法，代之以兢兢业业爱惜国家一寸铁、一分钱，为国家积累资金、降低成本，实行最大限度节约的思想。很多工厂平时对浪费现象熟视无睹，及至被查出来，只是处分一二个责任者了事。这是不对的。党的组织对于工厂一切浪费现象绝不能采取旁观容忍态度。要知道，保护国家财产使它不受一点点损害，这绝不是什么经验或是能力问题，而是工厂每一个人的天职，是共产主义劳动态度问题。党组织的任务之一就是要通过经常持久的反浪费斗争来提高所有人的共产主义觉悟。要认真调查产生浪费现象的原因，从思想上进行批判，展开斗争，直到彻底消灭浪费现象为止。
