　　At the Demobilization Brigade
　　Zhang Ziqing
　　Some time ago, I stayed for a few days at the demobilization brigade of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Before I went, I had heard people say:
　　"Demobilized soldiers are mostly old, weak, disabled, and mischievous people; otherwise, they wouldn't be demobilized." However, after I arrived at this demobilization brigade, I quickly realized that such a statement was completely wrong.
　　The day I went, there were about a thousand demobilized soldiers listening to a report on the socialist transformation of agriculture on the square. They sat there neatly, listening attentively, taking notes, and each one of them looked radiant.
　　During my stay here, I met many people and participated in some of their meetings and study activities. I found that they were all people who were healthy, had good thoughts, and were knowledgeable.
　　In this brigade, I conducted surveys and interviews in four companies, totaling nine hundred and seventy-four people. Judging from their age and physical condition, more than 90% of them were young and middle-aged; only forty-six were over thirty-six years old; according to the army's requirements for physical condition, more than 80% were Grade A or Grade B, and only sixteen were third-degree disabled.
　　The vast majority of these comrades have been tested in war. There are participants in the Laiwu Campaign during the Liberation War, participants in the campaign to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's 74th Division, participants in the Huaihai Campaign, and participants in the million-strong army crossing the Yangtze River. Many of them shed blood in these battles and made contributions to the people. According to statistics: more than 45% of these demobilized soldiers are meritorious persons.
　　Their political quality is very high. Among the nine hundred and seventy-four people, five hundred and thirty-seven, or more than 50%, are members of the Communist Party of China. In addition, there are many members of the Communist Youth League. Many of them have held leadership positions in the army, serving as platoon leaders, deputy platoon leaders, quartermasters, squad leaders, deputy squad leaders, party or league branch secretaries, deputy secretaries, committee members, group leaders, or as cultural instructors and clerks. Many people have technical skills, can drive tanks and cars, have served as telephone operators, health workers, surveyors, mechanics, etc. Many people have even learned the technology of the production or construction sectors, and can work as carpenters, bricklayers, stonemasons, electricians, plumbers, ironworkers, and can also fire bricks, tiles, and lime. More than 70% of them have reached the level of elementary school education. 25% have reached the level of higher elementary school, and some have even higher levels of education. These soldiers, who are healthy, of high political quality, and have undergone strict organizational training and war testing, are reluctant to leave their close comrades and military combat posts when they are about to be demobilized, but in order to meet the needs of national construction and to give the majority of young people the opportunity to serve in the People's Liberation Army, they resolutely move to the posts of production and construction in accordance with the decisions of their superiors. When they bid farewell to their comrades, they repeatedly made requests to the comrades who remained in the team and expressed their determination. They demanded that the comrades who remained in the team must cherish their weapons, take good care of the new soldiers, improve their skills, and strive to liberate Taiwan. They themselves expressed that after demobilization, they would work hard in their new construction posts, work hard, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and be ready to return to the front line at any time. Chen Zhongxiang, a soldier from the Second Company of a certain unit, was about to leave the company, and he ran to the company headquarters and said to the political instructor: "Political instructor, I will leave the communication address to you. As soon as the invaders invade our motherland, you write me a letter, and I will come immediately!"
　　Writing this, I cannot help but think: so many Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and so many strong revolutionary soldiers who were born and died for the revolutionary cause, when they are demobilized, what a great force it will be for strengthening the local work, especially political work and militia work! What a great force it will be for the socialist construction and agricultural production of the motherland! They have good physical conditions and political qualities, suitable age and a certain level of education, and good work habits and the spirit of overcoming difficulties. Such people, no matter what kind of work or labor they engage in, will create achievements and realize their determination to "be the backbone in the army, and also be the backbone in the local area" and "make contributions in the war, and be sure to make contributions on the production front."
　　Not long after that, one day, I saw thousands of demobilized soldiers raising their right hands to the "August 1st" military flag that guided them forward - they bid farewell to the military flag. Then they boarded trains, cars, and ships with confidence and set off for their hometowns. I warmly wish them that after demobilization, under the leadership of the local party organizations and governments, they will quickly achieve new achievements in their new positions.

### 在复员大队

　　在复员大队
　　张子清
    前些日子，我到中国人民解放军某部的复员大队中逗留了几天。在没有去以前，我曾听人说：
  “复员军人多是些老弱残疾，又调皮捣蛋的人；要不，就不会叫他们复员。”可是，当我到了这个复员大队之后，很快就知道那种说法是完全错误的。
    我去的那天，约有千人左右的复员军人，正在广场上听关于农业的社会主义改造问题的报告。他们整整齐齐地坐在那里，聚精会神地听着，记着笔记，一个个都红光满面。
    我在这里停留期间，曾经接触了许多人，也参加了他们的一些会议和学习活动。我发现他们都是身体好、思想好、而且是有知识的人。
    在这个大队，我调查访问了四个中队，共九百七十四人。从他们的年龄、身体条件来看，他们中百分之九十以上都是青壮年；超过三十六岁的只有四十六人；按照部队对身体条件的要求，百分之八十以上都是甲等或乙等，只有十六个是有三等残废的。
    这些同志绝大多数都经过战争的考验。这里有在解放战争中莱芜战役的参加者，有消灭蒋贼御林军七十四师的战役的参加者，有淮海大战的参加者，还有百万雄师下江南的参加者。他们之中有相当多的人在这些战役中流了血，为人民建立了功勋。据统计：这批复员军人中有百分之四十五以上都是功臣。
    他们的政治质量很高，在九百七十四人里面，有五百三十七人即百分之五十以上是中国共产党党员。此外还有不少青年团员。他们有很多人在部队里担任过领导工作，当过排长、副排长、司务长、正班长、副班长、党或团的支部书记、副书记、委员、小组长，或者当过文化教员和文书等。有很多人有技术，会驾驶坦克、汽车，当过电话员、卫生员、测量员、机械员等，有不少人甚至还学会了生产部门或建筑部门的技术，会作木工、瓦工、石工、水电工、铁工以及烧砖瓦、烧石灰。他们的文化水平百分之七十以上达到了初小程度。百分之二十五达到了高小程度，还有一些人的文化程度更高。这批身体好、政治质量高、经过严格的组织锻炼和战争考验的战士们，在离开部队即将复员的时候，都依依不舍、不愿离开那些亲密的战友和军事战斗的岗位，但是为了适应国家建设的需要，为了使广大青年有到人民解放军服役的机会，他们按照上级的决定，坚定地走向生产建设的岗位。他们和自己的战友告别时，曾经再三地向留队的同志提出要求并表示自己的决心。他们要求留队的同志们一定要爱护武器，带好新战士、提高本领，为解放台湾而奋斗。他们自己则表示，复员后一定在新的建设岗位上努力生产，努力工作，支援人民解放军解放台湾，并随时准备重上前线。某部二连战士陈忠祥要离开连队了，他跑到连部对指导员说：“指导员，我把通讯处给你留下，只要侵略者一旦进犯我们祖国，你就给我写信，我马上就来！”
    写到这里，我不由得这样想：这么多的共产党员、青年团员，这么多为了革命事业而出生入死的坚强的革命战士，当他们复员之后，对当地的各项工作、特别是政治工作和民兵工作的加强，将是一支多末大的力量！对祖国的社会主义建设和农业生产，又将是一支多末大的力量！他们有着良好的身体条件和政治素养，有着相宜的年龄和一定的文化水平，有着很好的劳动习惯和克服困难的精神。像这样的人，无论从事什么工作，什么劳动，都会创造出成绩，实现他们“在部队里是骨干，到地方上同样要做骨干”，“在战争中立了功，在生产战线上一定也要立功”的决心的。
    这以后不久的一天，我看到几千名复员军人向着引导他们前进的“八一”军旗举起了他们的右手——他们向军旗告别了。然后他们满怀信心地乘上火车、汽车、轮船，向着他们自己的家乡进发。我热烈地预祝他们在复员之后，在当地党组织和政府的领导下，迅速在新的岗位上获得新的成就。
