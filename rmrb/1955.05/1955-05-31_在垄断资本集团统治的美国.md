　　In the United States Under the Rule of Monopoly Capital Groups
　　American Monopoly Capitalists Fear the Relaxation of the International Situation Most
　　New York Dispatch: It can be seen from reports in some American newspapers that American monopoly capitalists are unwilling to see the international situation relax.

　　The "Time" magazine published on May 23rd said that recently, "there have been signs of easing international tensions almost every day," which worries Wall Street businessmen. Reflecting this sentiment is the recent decline in New York industrial stocks. In particular, the stocks of companies producing military aircraft such as Boeing, Douglas, Lockheed, and Northrop have fallen by 35 percent from their highest prices this year. The magazine said that the question that is now troubling every American investor is: if peace were to occur, what impact would it have on the American economy? If military spending is cut, what will it mean for various sectors of American business?

　　The Phenomenon of Big Companies Devouring Small Companies is Increasing

　　It can be seen from the report of the Federal Trade Commission that the process of concentration of industrial capital and financial capital in the United States is accelerating.

　　The report said that large companies are accelerating the acquisition of smaller companies. Even according to the commission's far from complete materials, between 1948 and 1954, 1,773 companies in the processing and mining industries were acquired. In recent years, small business owners have rapidly gone bankrupt. For example, the number of companies acquired in 1954 tripled that of 1949.

　　The report also pointed out that capital in the machinery manufacturing industry, metal products industry, transportation equipment industry, food industry, chemical industry, electrical technology industry, and textile industry is also accelerating its concentration.

　　American Farmers' Income is Less This Year Than Last Year

　　The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that American farmers' income from selling products in the first four months of 1955 decreased by 5 percent compared with the same period in 1954. Income from the sale of livestock and livestock products decreased by 8 percent compared with the same period last year.

　　National Farmers Union President Patton said at the Oklahoma Farmers Union convention not long ago that a "crisis" is approaching American farmers. Patton pointed out that farmers' net income has decreased by 13 percent in the past two years, and "there is no sign to foresee any improvement in the situation."

　　Not long ago, the Ministry of Agriculture predicted that the income of farmers planting wheat this year will decrease sharply, because the drought has killed 22.5 percent of the crops whose sown area has already been reduced.

　　The Tax Burden on Ordinary Americans is Getting Heavier and Heavier

　　New York Dispatch: "Time" magazine reported that American state governments are setting up various new tax items and increasing existing tax rates to increase the tax burden on ordinary American people. This year, twelve state governments are preparing to levy new taxes, and twenty-nine state governments are preparing to increase existing tax rates. New York State's personal income tax has increased by 11 percent this year, and the Iowa legislature has increased sales tax, excise tax, income tax, and other types of taxes by 8 percent.

　　According to statistics, in the 1956 fiscal year, the taxes levied by the entire U.S. state level will be as high as 12 billion U.S. dollars, which is 275 percent more than the taxes levied in 1945.

　　Black Pastor Killed for Defending His Right to Vote

　　It can be seen from American newspaper reports that in the United States, especially in the southern United States, racialist terror is becoming increasingly rampant.

　　A racist organization was established in Mississippi, its purpose being to intimidate blacks by all means, even armed terror, and suppress their struggle for social and political rights.

　　According to the black newspaper "Defender" published in Chicago, this organization recently carried out a series of armed attacks on blacks. Not long ago, George Lee, a black pastor in Belzoni, Mississippi, was killed by racist bandits for refusing to remove his name from the voter list. According to the newspaper, Mitchell, the leader of the Washington branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said to a Senate subcommittee that there is a system in Mississippi where any black person who registers to vote will be immediately fired by his boss.

　　在垄断资本集团统治的美国
    美国垄断资本家最害怕国际局势缓和
    纽约消息：从美国一些报刊上的报道里可以看到，美国垄断资本家不愿国际局势缓和。
    五月二十三日出版的“时代”周刊说，最近“差不多每天都有国际紧张局势趋向缓和的迹象”，这些情况使华尔街的商人们担心。反映这种情绪的是纽约工业股票前些日子的下跌。其中特别如波音、道格拉斯、洛克希德、诺斯罗普这些出产军用飞机的公司的股票，比今年所曾达到的最高价格下跌了百分之三十五。这家杂志说，现在正使每一个美国投资家困恼的问题是：假如一旦出现和平局面，对美国的经济将会发生怎样的影响？假如军费开支削减，对美国企业的各个部门将会意味着什么？
    大公司吞吃小公司的现象越来越多
    从联邦贸易委员会的报告中可以看出，美国工业资本和金融资本集中的过程正在加紧。
    报告说，大的公司在加紧吞并较小的公司。甚至根据这个委员会远非完全的材料，在一九四八年到一九五四年间，加工工业和开采工业中，有一千七百七十三个公司被吞并了。在最近几年中，小企业主迅速地走向破产。例如，在一九五四年被吞并的公司，增为一九四九年的三倍。
    报告还指出：在机器制造业、金属制成品工业、运输装备业、食品工业、化学工业以及电力技术工业和纺织工业中的资本，也正在加紧集中。
    今年美国农民的收入又比去年少了
    美国农业部宣布，美国农民在一九五五年头四个月中出售产品所得的收入比一九五四年同一时期减少了百分之五。出售牲畜和畜产品的收入比去年同一时期减少了百分之八。
    全国农民联盟主席派顿不久前在俄克拉何马州农民联盟集会上发言说，“危机”迫近美国农民。派顿指出，最近两年中农民的纯收入已减少百分之十三，“没有任何迹象可以预见情况会有任何改善”。
    不久前农业部曾经预示，今年种植小麦的农民的收入将急剧减少，因为旱灾使播种面积原先就已缩减的庄稼又旱死了百分之二十二点五。
    普通美国人的纳税负担越来越沉重
    纽约消息：“时代”周刊报道，美国州政府正在设立各种新税目和增加现行税额，来加重普通美国人民的纳税负担。今年有十二个州政府准备征收新税，有二十九个州政府准备增加现行的税额。纽约州今年的个人所得税已增加了百分之十一，衣阿华州的立法机构已将销售税、消费税、所得税和其他种类的税收都增加了百分之八。
    据统计，在一九五六财政年度，整个美国州一级所征的赋税，将高达一百二十亿美元，这比一九四五年所征的税款增加了百分之二百七十五。
    维护自己选举权利的黑人牧师被打死
    从美国报刊消息中可以看出，在美国，特别是在美国南部地区，种族主义恐怖日益猖獗。
    密士失必州成立了一个种族主义组织，它的宗旨是以一切手段，甚至武装恐怖来恫吓黑人，镇压他们争取社会和政治权利的斗争。
    据芝加哥出版的黑人报纸“保卫者”报道，这个组织最近对黑人进行了一连串的武装袭击。不久以前，密士失必州比尔索尼城的一个黑人牧师乔治·李因为拒绝把自己的名字撤出选民名单而被种族主义匪徒杀死。据报纸报道，全国有色人种协进会华盛顿分会领导人密契尔在参议院小组委员会上说，密士失必州有这样一种制度：任何黑人一经登记参加投票，就会马上被老板解雇。　（据新华社讯）
