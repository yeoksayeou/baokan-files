A Suggestion to Writers, Actors, and Singers

To the Editor:

　　I am a Chinese student studying at the Moscow National Economic Institute. Having lived in the Soviet Union for nearly two years, I deeply feel that Soviet writers, actors, singers, composers, and the masses have extremely close ties. They have become active participants and organizers of the Soviet people's cultural life. In Soviet institutions, schools, factories, dormitories, and clubs, musical performances, poetry recitations, meetings with writers and actors, small-scale soirees, and other cultural and recreational activities are frequently held. Soviet actors, writers, singers, and composers often conduct literary and artistic activities in these places. Because they participate in these activities, the cultural life of the Soviet people has become healthier and richer, and the forms have become more diverse and novel. These rich cultural and recreational activities play an immeasurable role in cultivating people's love for the motherland, love for life, and an optimistic and cheerful character.

　　Not long ago, I participated in a soiree at our dormitory club. At the meeting, several Soviet composers performed their latest works. The form was extremely simple, just a piano, with the composer accompanying and the singer singing, but the scene was very lively. As soon as one song was finished on stage, the audience below welcomed another one. The performers thanked the audience several times, but the applause was endless, shouting "Encore!" This enthusiastic situation gave the cultural workers great encouragement and strength. They are closely connected with the masses, and the masses evaluate their creations during these performances. In this way, cultural workers no longer suffer from a lack of performance opportunities. More importantly, with these cultural and recreational activities, office workers and workers no longer feel that they have nothing to do after work and that life is monotonous.

　　During my stay in Moscow, I was deeply impressed by this. Therefore, from afar, I suggest to the actors, writers, singers, composers, dancers, and drama workers of our motherland: take your works to the masses and let them evaluate them! They will give you a lot of help and encouragement and strength. Through your activities in various places, you will promote the further invigoration of the motherland's cultural and recreational life! Comrades! Better use the weapons you have mastered to carry out communist education!

### 向作家、演员、歌唱家提出的一个建议

　　向作家、演员、歌唱家提出的一个建议编辑同志：
    我是一个中国留学生，现在莫斯科国立经济学院学习。我在苏联生活将近二年的时间里，深深地感到苏联的作家、演员、歌唱家、作曲家和人民群众之间有着极为密切的联系，他们已经成为苏联人民文化生活的积极活动者和组织者。在苏联的机关、学校、工厂和集体宿舍以及俱乐部里经常要举办音乐、诗歌朗诵，作家、演员和群众见面会，小型晚会等文娱活动，苏联的演员、作家、歌唱家和作曲家们经常就在这些地方进行文学艺术方面的活动。由于他们参加了这些活动，苏联人民的文化生活就更加健康、丰富了，形式也更加多样新颖了。通过这些内容丰富的文化娱乐活动，对培养人民热爱祖国、热爱生活和乐观开朗的性格都起了不可估量的作用。
    不久以前，我曾参加了我们宿舍俱乐部的一个晚会，在这个会上，有几位苏联的作曲工作者把他们最近的新作进行了表演；形式极简单，只是一架钢琴，作曲者自己伴奏，歌唱者演唱，场面却十分热烈。台上刚唱完一个，台下观众就欢迎再来一个，表演者几次谢场，还是掌声不绝高呼
  “再来一个”。这种热烈情况给了文化工作者以极大的鼓舞和力量。他们是同群众紧紧地联系在一起，同时在这些场所演出时，群众鉴定了他们的创作；这样，文化工作者不再苦于没有演出的机会了。更重要的，在有了这些文化娱乐活动以后，机关工作者、工人们不再感到下班后无事可做，生活单调了。
    居住在莫斯科的期间，我在这方面得到的印象是极为深刻的，因此我从遥远的地方向我们祖国的演员、作家、歌唱家、作曲家、舞蹈家和戏剧工作者建议：把你们的作品拿到群众面前去让群众进行鉴定吧！他们对你们的作品会给予很大的帮助的，会给你们很大的鼓舞和力量的。通过你们在各种场所的活动，会推动祖国的文化娱乐生活进一步活跃起来的；同志们！更好地把你们掌握的进行共产主义教育的武器运用起来吧！
