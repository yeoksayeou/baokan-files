　　The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Holds Report Meeting
　  Report on the Visit to Burma by the Chinese Buddhist Delegation

Xinhua News Agency, 26th - The head of the Chinese Buddhist Delegation to Burma, Xirao Gyatso, and the Secretary-General of the delegation, Zhao Puchu, reported on their visit to Burma at a report meeting organized by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 25th. More than two hundred people attended the meeting, including members of various democratic parties and people's organizations.

The report meeting was presided over by Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In his speech, Xirao Gyatso first expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome the delegation received from the Burmese government and people during their visit to Burma. He said that Burma is a Buddhist country, so it is very concerned about Buddhism in other countries. Through this visit, they have learned more about China's freedom of religious belief. This is helpful in enhancing the friendly relations between Buddhists and people of China and Burma, and it is beneficial to the cause of peace.

Zhao Puchu then gave a more detailed report. He said that during the delegation's stay in Burma, they visited eleven towns including Rangoon; the delegation paid homage to thirty-nine pagodas and temples, and in some places discovered Chinese-style pagoda images, which shows the long-standing relationship between Chinese and Burmese Buddhist cultures.

Zhao Puchu said that the desire of Burmese Buddhists to safeguard peace and strengthen Sino-Burmese friendship is the same as that of Chinese Buddhists. Everywhere they went, they could hear them wishing for friendship between China and Burma and for world peace.

Zhao Puchu finally said that Chinese Buddhists must work for peace, and we hope to work together with Burmese Buddhists, as well as Buddhists from all other countries, to safeguard peace.
