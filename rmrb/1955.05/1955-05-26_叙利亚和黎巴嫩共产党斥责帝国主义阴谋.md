　　Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, May 22nd, TASS dispatch: Damascus news, the Central Committees of the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Parties held a meeting.
    The Central Committee issued a statement saying that the policy of the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Parties is to resolutely resist the pressure of imperialism.
    The statement pointed out that all levels of the Lebanese people unanimously condemned the Turkish-Iraqi-British military treaty and other imperialist military alliances.
    The statement pointed out that the United States and Britain are attempting to turn Lebanon into their military base in the Near East, and therefore they want to build military roads and airports, etc. The Central Committee pointed out that cooperation between Syria and Lebanon is the most reliable guarantee for safeguarding the vital interests of the two countries, and this cooperation will also help to further strengthen cooperation with other Arab countries in the struggle against imperialism and the threat of war.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Iraqi government and the Western imperialists behind it are constantly attempting to obstruct the establishment of a tripartite alliance between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria, and are attempting to win Syria over to join the Near East's aggressive bloc. The visits of former Iraqi Prime Minister Jamil al-Madfai and former Foreign Minister Dhufik al-Suwaidi to Damascus and Beirut were precisely to achieve this goal. According to Damascus news, Suwaidi held talks with Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali and other leaders during his three-day stay in Damascus. Suwaidi's mission was to put pressure on the Syrian government in order to force it to abandon its participation in the Arab tripartite alliance proposed by Egypt.
    According to newspaper reports, the Syrian government insists on its position and refuses to participate in military blocs. The "Telegraph" reported that Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali said to Suwaidi during the talks: "The international situation is improving. This once again convinces us that there is no reason to conclude military pacts, and that this policy will go bankrupt. Syria's participation in maintaining world peace is in accordance with the will of the Syrian people, who do not want to participate in any non-Arab military alliances."

　　叙利亚和黎巴嫩共产党斥责帝国主义阴谋
    新华社二十三日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特二十二日讯：大马士革消息，叙利亚和黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会举行了会议。
    中央委员会发表声明说，叙利亚和黎巴嫩共产党的政策是坚决反抗帝国主义的压力。
    声明指出，黎巴嫩各阶层人民一致谴责土耳其—伊拉克—英国军事条约以及其他帝国主义军事联盟。
    声明指出，美国和英国企图把黎巴嫩变成它们在近东的军事基地，因此它们要建造军用公路和飞机场等等。中央委员会指出，叙利亚和黎巴嫩的合作是保障两国的切身利益的最可靠的保证，这种合作还将有助于进一步加强同其他阿拉伯国家在反对帝国主义、反对战争威胁的斗争中的合作。
    据新华社讯　伊拉克政府以及站在它背后的西方帝国主义者正不断地企图阻挠埃及、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚缔结三国联盟，并企图拉拢叙利亚参加近东的侵略集团。伊拉克前首相贾米尔·马德费和前外交大臣杜斐克·苏威迪访问大马士革和贝鲁特正是为了想达到这个目的。据大马士革消息，苏威迪在大马士革停留的三天中，曾同叙利亚总理阿萨利和其他领袖进行了会谈。苏威迪的任务是：对叙利亚政府施加压力，以达到迫使它放弃参加埃及所建议的阿拉伯三国联盟的目的。
    据报纸报道，叙利亚政府坚持自己的立场，拒绝参加军事集团。“电讯报”报道，叙利亚总理阿萨利在同苏威迪谈话时说：“国际局势在好转。这就又一次使我们相信：缔结军事公约是没有理由的，而这种政策是会破产的。叙利亚参加维护世界和平，是遵照不愿意参加任何非阿拉伯军事同盟的叙利亚人民的意志。”
