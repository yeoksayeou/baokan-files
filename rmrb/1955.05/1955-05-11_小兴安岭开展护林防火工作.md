　　Greater Khingan Range is currently carrying out intensive spring forest fire prevention work. Due to the small amount of snow this year and the dryness of the vegetation, the spring forest fire prevention work is particularly heavy. The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee has now issued instructions prohibiting smoking, land clearing by burning, burning incense, and burning paper in the forest area during the fire prevention period. The Provincial Forestry Department has dispatched a large number of cadres to major forest areas to inspect and assist in fire prevention work. The propaganda work for forest fire prevention is also being widely carried out. Ninety thousand propaganda posters and slogans, as well as a large number of forest fire prevention pamphlets and speakers' speeches, have been distributed to various forest areas, and propaganda has also been carried out for immigrants and passing travelers. All forest industrial departments have designated special cadres to be responsible for fire prevention work. Forest police and some volunteer fire brigades have also begun field patrols and mountain searches to prevent counter-revolutionaries from arson and sabotage. Aircraft from the aerial forest protection station are also patrolling over the Greater Khingan Range. (Our correspondent in Harbin)

　　小兴安岭开展护林防火工作
    小兴安岭林区现正紧张进行春季护林防火工作。由于今年雪小，草木干燥，因此，春季的护林防火工作特别繁重。现黑龙江省人民委员会已发出指示，防火期间严禁在林区野外吸烟、烧荒、烧香、烧纸。省林业厅派出大批干部分赴主要林区检查和协助防火工作。护林防火的宣传工作也在广泛展开，九万张宣传画和标语及大批护林防火的小册子和宣传员讲话已分发各林区，对外来移民和过往旅客也进行了宣传。各森林工业部门都指定了专门干部负责防火工作。森林警察和部分义务护林队亦开始野外巡查和搜山，以防止反革命分子纵火破坏。航空护林站的飞机，也正在小兴安岭上空巡逻。　（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
