　　The Fertile Yellow River Irrigation Area
　　By our reporter Lü Jianzhong
    As the Beijing-Hankou railway train crosses the Yellow River iron bridge northward, it enters the fertile Yellow River irrigation area. On the vast open fields, large and small canals are inlaid like veins, and farmers in groups of three or five are busily and quietly sowing cotton.
    This area used to be frequently flooded by the Yellow River. Ever since the People's Government built the People's Victory Canal here, and the Yellow River water first flowed into the wheat fields along the canal on April 10, 1952, a brand-new page has been turned in the lives of the people here. In the first year of Yellow River irrigation, there was a severe drought for more than seventy days in late summer and early autumn, but the first two irrigation areas that were tested irrigated 284,000 mu of land, increasing production by more than 15.54 million jin of seed cotton and 8 million jin of millet and corn. The irrigated cotton yielded more than 120 jin per mu compared to the unirrigated cotton. The second year was also a spring drought, but in addition to the irrigated wheat increasing production by more than 7.87 million jin in the entire irrigation area, the more than 200,000 mu of cotton sown with irrigation also achieved another bumper harvest. By 1954, the irrigated area had expanded to 600,000 mu, and the masses' confidence in increasing production was further enhanced. More fertilizer was also applied than in previous years, and the irrigated wheat increased production by more than 20.05 million jin compared to 1953. At the same time, because the Yellow River irrigation area is equipped with both irrigation and drainage canals, it has also eliminated the long-standing problem of waterlogging here. Therefore, in the particularly rainy year of 1954, the cotton here still achieved a good harvest. This year, the farmers here are expanding cotton fields in accordance with the state plan and striving to increase yield per unit area to support the country's industrial construction.
    Now, the surveying work for a small hydropower station to be built here has been completed. In the future, after the hydropower station is built, not only can more than a dozen pumping stations be added to expand the Yellow River irrigation area, but also electricity can be used to expand local cotton ginning, oil pressing, flour milling, agricultural tool and other handicraft processing, as well as supply lighting to nearby rural areas. At that time, when the train passes through here again, passengers will be able to see the electric lights shining in the countryside at night.

　　富饶的引黄灌溉区
　　本报记者　吕建中
    京汉铁路北行列车一穿过黄河铁桥，就进入了富饶的引黄灌溉区。辽阔的原野上，镶嵌着脉络般的大小渠道，三五成群的农民在紧张而宁静地播种棉花。
    这里，过去是黄河经常泛滥的地区。自从人民政府在这里兴建人民胜利渠，一九五二年四月十日黄水第一次沿着渠道流进麦田的时候起，这里人民的生活就揭开了崭新的一页。引黄灌溉第一年的夏末秋初酷旱了七十多天，而第一批试水的两个灌区浇了二十八万四千亩地，增产了一千五百四十多万斤籽棉，八百万斤谷子和玉米，浇水的棉花比没浇的每亩多收一百二十多斤。第二年又是春旱，可是全灌溉区除浇水的小麦增产了七百八十多万斤外，浇水播种的二十多万亩棉花也再次获得了丰收。到一九五四年，灌溉面积扩大到六十万亩，群众增产信心更提高了，施肥也比往年多了，浇水的小麦又比一九五三年增产了两千零五万多斤。同时，由于引黄灌溉区并设着灌溉和排水两种渠道，这也就解除了这里历来无法解决的内涝，因此在一九五四年特别多雨的情况下，这里的棉花仍然获得良好收成。今年，这里的农民都按照国家计划扩大棉田，并努力提高单位面积产量，支援祖国工业建设。
    现在，准备在这里兴建的一座小型水力发电站的测量工作已经完成。将来，水力发电站建成以后，不仅可以添设十几个抽水机站，扩大引黄灌溉面积，同时还可以利用电力扩展当地的轧花、榨油、磨粉、农具等手工业加工，及供给附近农村照明，那时候，列车再经过这里，旅客们在夜晚就能够看到农村里闪耀着的电灯光了。
