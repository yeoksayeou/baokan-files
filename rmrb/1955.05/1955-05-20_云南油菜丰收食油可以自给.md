Yunnan's Rapeseed Harvest Allows for Self-Sufficiency in Edible Oil

Most areas of Yunnan Province have achieved a bumper rapeseed harvest this year. It is estimated that the total output this year will increase by more than 32% compared to 1954. The entire province can completely achieve self-sufficiency in edible oil, fundamentally changing the past situation where it was necessary to rely on other provinces for supply. It will also be able to transfer some rapeseed to supply other provinces.

In order to do a good job in the procurement work, all regions have made full preparations. The Yuxi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also set up 26 purchasing stations throughout the county. In addition to setting up purchasing stations in twelve key producing areas, the Jiangchuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also organized small merchants to go to the countryside and hold small-scale material exchange meetings for purchasing, greatly facilitating farmers to sell rapeseed. During the procurement period, all regions also arranged for the supply of edible oil. Therefore, farmers are enthusiastically selling. (Yuan Zhuxuan)

　  云南油菜丰收食油可以自给
    云南省今年油菜大部地区都获得丰收。据估计今年总产量可比一九五四年增加百分之三十二以上，全省食油可以完全达到自给自足，根本改变了过去历年需要外省供应的情况，并且还可调出一部分菜籽供应外省。
    为了做好收购工作，各地都做了充分准备工作，玉溪县供销合作社还在全县设立了二十六个收购站，江川县供销合作社除了在十二个重点产区设立收购站外，还组织小商贩下乡和召开小型物资交流会进行收购，大大方便了农民出卖菜籽。各地在收购期间，还安排好了食油供应工作。因此，农民都踊跃出售。　（袁注轩）
