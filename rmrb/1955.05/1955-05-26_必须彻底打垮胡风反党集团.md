　　We Must Thoroughly Crush the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique
　　Ba Jin

　　Those who knew Hu Feng but not the Hu Feng clique all had this impression: this person was very difficult to approach. When talking to him, one always felt that the words were not coming from his heart. He liked to satirize people, always making a sarcastic remark or two when meeting you, and sometimes showing an unnatural smile. He usually liked to talk about terms like "sincerity," "benevolent heart," and "humanitarianism," but everyone felt that these terms could not be connected with him personally.

　　Hu Feng's earliest published articles were not too difficult to understand. However, in the past ten years or so, he wrote more and more obscurely, simply making it impossible for people to read. Even if someone patiently finished reading, they would not understand what he was talking about. Mr. Ye Shengtao mentioned his article "On the Road of Realism" and said, "Why does a person have to write articles that no one can understand!" According to Hu Feng himself, he had to use "slave language" when publishing articles under the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek at that time. We all guessed: he liked to copy arguments from Japanese theoretical books, so he wrote articles that did not look like Chinese.

　　In literary circles, many people knew that Hu Feng had a sect, a clique, and could even name some of the members of this clique. For many years, people have been talking about who was in the Hu Feng faction, and everyone also suspected that the Hu Feng clique had been secretly active. But we were not clear about what they were doing. At the Second Meeting of the National Committee of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles last October, Hu Feng spoke up for his clique members A Long, Lu Ling, and Ji Fang. He not only talked about some internal affairs of the Shanghai New Literature and Art Publishing House, but he even knew the name of a reader who wrote a letter criticizing Ji Fang's novel. For many years before liberation, Hu Feng had disguised himself as "an organizer of literary work standing around the Party" (in his own words), and of course no one said that he was not a progressive literary critic. But we were very suspicious: Why did a progressive literary critic engage in small cliques, and why did he have to expand the activities of his clique after liberation? Who were they using this clique to deal with?

　　Before Hu Feng's "Opinions" were published, literary circles were spreading the news of this major event. It was said that the Hu Feng faction considered this a great victory for them. And the Hu Feng faction in Shanghai even had a dinner to celebrate it and toasted to Hu Feng's health. But when Hu Feng himself knew that his "Opinions" were to be printed and given to the masses for discussion, he immediately began to write his "Self-Criticism." Many people were surprised: How could a stubborn person like Hu Feng immediately lower his head when he knew that the Chinese Writers Association was going to publish his "Opinions" written after "careful examination"? Where did this 180-degree turn come from? Was it because someone who always liked to hide in dark corners would lower their head when they saw the sun?

　　Regarding all this, I found the answer in the "materials" revealed by Shu Wu published in the People's Daily on the 13th of this month. Hu Feng had two faces: one true, one false. People who were not in the Hu Feng faction could only see Hu Feng's false appearance. He regarded us as "local tyrants," "maggots," "philistines," and "opportunists." He used all "strategies" and "smokescreens" to deal with us, and even his smile was "wrapped in contempt." No wonder his smile was always unnatural. He "shook hands and made peace" with you on the surface, but in his heart, he was calculating how to whip you with a rubber whip "wrapped in steel wire," or even how to "feed himself" with you. He would never use "sincerity" and "benevolent heart" to deal with you. Unless you were willing to be a member of his clique and accept his instructions, he would never tell you a word of truth.

　　Hu Feng called his truth "private words." When he spoke "private words," he took off his smiling mask and revealed the sinister and ugly face of a great conspirator. At that time, he could speak freely. He could vent his "too much resentment." He could use the most vicious words to scold those progressive literary workers inside and outside the Party who had helped him, guided him, and were willing to be friends with him. (Even Mr. Lu Xun and Mr. Wen Yiduo did not receive a little respect from him. I still remember him speaking sadly and passionately at several memorial meetings for Mr. Lu Xun, but he said to his own people that it was a routine "disaster" and "extremely boring.") He could "dance a devil's dance." So his secret letters were all written clearly and clearly, without a word of "slave language." He only used "slave language" when he was telling lies, that is, calling "hypocrisy" "sincerity," calling "cruelty" "benevolence," calling "the whip for beating prisoners" "humanitarianism," and using the cloak of Marxism to disguise his "subjective fighting spirit" and "self-expansion" in which "everything is prepared for me." Even if he had a tongue like a reed, it would be difficult for him to turn white into black, so he had to stammer and stutter, saying things that did not sound like Chinese and writing articles that did not look like Chinese. Some young people actually regarded them as classics, thinking how profound the author's knowledge was and how profound the theory was, which mostly relied on the boasting and praise of his clique members. His clique members were very loyal to their master. They struggled for a common goal: "to shake the twenty-year-old mechanistic ruling force." For this goal, they even did not hesitate to cooperate with newspapers that were "very bad" or had "bad standpoints," and "were determined to coexist with the position," "determined to launch a year of charge," "fighting and retreating, rolling and fighting." Hu Feng's so-called "very powerful" "enemies" were progressive literary workers inside and outside the Party. Their clique was fighting to deal with these "enemies." So after liberation, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, he still deployed troops and generals, "opened up work," established strongholds, and developed their literary movement.

　　From these "private words," it can already be seen to what height the individual ambitions and power desires of this great conspirator have developed, and it can also be seen that the Hu Feng clique is no longer a "small clique," but an anti-Party and anti-people reactionary clique. They have been doing those behind-the-scenes conspiracies with hidden daggers. They took these murderous, sinister, and honey-tongued "private words" as "human nourishment" to "mutually nurture," and it is terrifying to think about it until today. Hu Feng said in his "Self-Criticism": "If it were not for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I personally would not have been able to find a place to settle down for more than twenty years." After reading this sentence and then thinking about the things above, it makes people feel even more terrible.

　　Writing here, I read the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" published in the People's Daily on the 24th. These were all secret letters written by Hu Feng to his clique members after liberation, and naturally they were only a small part of the secret letters. But they painted Hu Feng's hideous face more vividly, more vividly, and more completely. They also explained more things to us: Hu Feng's 180-degree turn was only "for the cause, for a more distant future!" This was his own words. To put it bluntly, it was a temporary retreat, preserving strength, waiting for the opportunity, and making a comeback. So when he rewrote his "Self-Criticism," he repeatedly told his clique members to be "calm" and "composed," and to "seek rebirth in suffering." He was unwilling to surrender to the Party and the people. Because he had determined five years ago that they "would win," and he also predicted "a period of five years." Even after the attack failed, he would not put down his weapons, because he still had so many tactics: such as "the tactics of Sun Wukong getting into the belly," "heart-digging war," "nerve war," "drip-by-drip struggle"; he still had so many "fighters": those names were really shocking! Some of them no one had ever suspected that they were members of the Hu Feng clique (some even mixed into the Party and acted as Hu Feng's spies); and he still had so many territories: even the New Literature and Art Publishing House led by the Party had become the main base of his clique; and he still had such a tight organization, with liaison officers, "organizational principles," and plans; and some organs still had his spies, stealing Party documents for him and inquiring about the situation. If these situations were not changed, if Hu Feng still grasped so many favorable conditions, how could he not make a comeback?

　　In fact, Hu Feng had already made a comeback once. In March 1950, he said: "The Shanghai literary scene is being galloped by several strong men, and it is impossible for us to publish books and periodicals." But four years later (March 1954), he wrote a letter ordering the editors of the Shanghai New Literature and Art Publishing House to "tell me a simple list of which bad books have been published since the establishment of your publishing house, why they were published, which good books have been published, and what twists and turns and blows have been suffered before and after." At this time, it was no longer that they "could not publish books" (Hu Feng, A Long, Lu Ling, Ji Fang, Zhu Sheng, Lu Dian, Luo Luo... books were all published by the New Literature and Art Publishing House one after another), but that those who opposed them could not publish books, but that the editors of the publishing house led by the Party served Hu Feng, "helped" him "do work," collected materials, and cooperated in the battle. At this time, Hu Feng no longer "played dead," he was "galloping" the New Literature and Art Publishing House, commanding clique members to launch a frantic attack on the people's literary cause. Although his "rash advance" failed this time, it has already brought no small losses to the people's literary cause. We should not forget this painful lesson. We should think that even when raising the white flag of false surrender, Hu Feng will definitely remember the sentence he wrote four years ago: "I am sharpening my sword, peeping at the direction, and when I see it right, I am willing to cut off my head and throw it out to smash that dirty and smelly iron wall." Can we let Hu Feng continue to sharpen his sword? Can the people of the whole country let Hu Feng continue to sharpen his sword? Of course not!

　　The entire "Second Batch of Materials" is filled with the vicious intentions of a conspirator. He meticulously arranged work, arranged personnel, expanded the organization, won territories, and even instigated his own people to contribute articles and write letters under pseudonyms to create "smokescreens" to threaten literary and art newspapers and periodicals, cheer him on, and direct clique members to fabricate facts, make false self-criticisms, and muddle through. All their means were nothing more than deception, falsehood, utilization, and rumor-mongering. His whole spirit was "self-expansion," touting himself, and cursing others. He boasted that his poems "shocked everyone." He scolded others as "flies and mosquitoes," "shameless," and "beasts." Except for vilifying Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as a "booklet that has been regarded as a 'totem'," or boasting a few sentences about his speech at the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Writers Association, he rarely talked about theory and academics. Even when he talked about theory and quoted materials, the editors of the New Literature and Art Publishing House had to help him. It can be seen that in addition to spreading hatred, fraud, and false poison gas (poisoning others and poisoning himself), he did not have any profound knowledge and profound theory. However, those clique members colluded with him, pushing him to the position of leader, using the false halo on his head to deceive young people, expand influence, strengthen strength, and attempt to establish their "independent kingdom."

　　Now their invisible attempts have been completely exposed. Their conspiracies have aroused universal indignation in literary and art circles, cultural circles, and even the people of the whole country. Everyone unanimously demands that the Hu Feng and his anti-Party and anti-people clique be thoroughly fought against. Naturally, there will be more "materials" revealed in the future, but these two batches of "materials" alone can already explain the crimes of this reactionary clique. The struggle has already begun, and we must thoroughly defeat his entire clique and not allow them to have the opportunity to make a comeback. We must completely expose their false faces, strip off their disguise, and make every member of this clique stand out from the dark corners, put down the "rubber-covered steel wire" whip and other secret weapons, honestly and sincerely surrender to the Party and the people, and from then on, reform and start anew. This is their only way to atone for their sins to the people.

　　必须彻底打垮胡风反党集团
　　巴金
    认识胡风而不是胡风集团的人都有这样一种印象：这个人是很难接近的。跟他谈起来，总觉得话不是从他心里说出来的。他喜欢讽刺人，见着面总要挖苦你两句，有时也露出不自然的微笑。他平日喜欢讲“真诚”、“仁爱的胸怀”、“人道主义”这
  一类名词，可是谁都觉得这些名词是跟他本人连不起来的。
    胡风最初发表的文章也并不是太难懂的。然而近十几年来他越写越晦涩，简直叫人没法读下去，即使有人耐心读完，也弄不明白他究竟在讲些什么。叶圣陶先生提到他那篇“论现实主义的路”时就说过这样的话：“一个人为什么要把文章写得叫人看不懂！”据胡风自己说，他在当时蒋介石反动政权下面发表文章不得不使用“奴隶的语言”。我们都猜想：他喜欢从日文理论书上抄引论据，所以写出了那种不大像中文的文章。
    在文艺界中也有不少人知道胡风有一个宗派、
  一个集团，而且也可以说出来这个集团的一部分成员的名字。好些年来就有人在谈谁是胡风派，而且大家还疑心胡风集团一直在暗中活动。可是他们究竟在干些什么事情，我们就不清楚了。去年十月胡风在中国文联全国委员会第二次会议上发言，替他的集团成员阿垅、路翎、冀汸讲话。他不但说出一些上海新文艺出版社内部的事情，而且连写信批评冀汸小说的一个读者的名字他也知道。胡风在解放前许多年就把自己装扮成“一个站在党底周围的文学工作的组织者”（用他自己的说法），当然没有人说他不是进步的文艺批评家。但是我们很怀疑：
  一个进步的文艺批评家为什么要搞小集团，而且为什么在解放以后还要扩大他的集团的活动呢？他们用这个集团究竟来对付谁？
    胡风的“意见书”发表以前，文艺界中间就在传播这件大事。听说胡风派认为这是他们的一个大的胜利。而且在上海的胡风派还为它聚餐庆祝，为胡风的健康干杯。可是胡风自己知道他的“意见书”要印出来交给群众讨论的时候，他马上动手写出了他的“自我批判”。好些人都奇怪：像胡风那样顽固的人，知道中国作家协会要把他在“慎重地做过检查”以后写成的“意见书”公开，怎么就会马上低下头来呢？这种一百八十度的大转变是从什么地方来的呢？是不是一向喜欢躲在阴暗角落里的人见到阳光就会低头呢？
    关于这一切，我在本月十三日人民日报发表的舒芜揭露的“材料”里面找到了解答。胡风有两个面目：一真，一假。不是胡风派的人就只能看见胡风的假的外表。他把我们当作“豪绅”、“蛆虫”、“市侩”、“投机”。他用来对付我们的全是些“战略”“疑阵”，连他的微笑里面也“包着侮蔑”，无怪乎他的微笑总是不自然的了。他在表面上跟你“握手言欢”，心里却在盘算怎样用“包着钢丝”的橡皮鞭子抽你，甚至怎样拿你去“养活自己”。他决不会用“真诚”和“仁爱的胸怀”来对付你。除非你愿意做他那个集团的成员，接受他的指示，他决不会对你讲一句真话。
    胡风把他的真话叫做“私房话”。他讲“私房话”的时候，便取下了他的带笑的假面具，露出他那个大阴谋家的阴狠、丑恶的面目。那个时候他可以畅所欲言了。他可以发泄他那“太多的愤恨”了。他可以用最恶毒的话来谩骂那些帮助过他、引导过他、愿意跟他交朋友的党内和党外的进步文艺工作者了。（连鲁迅先生和闻一多先生也得不到他一点点尊敬。我还记得他在几次的鲁迅先生纪念会上哀痛地激昂地讲过话，可是他对自己人却说那是照例的“灾难”，而且“无聊之至”。）他可以“跳它一个魔鬼之舞”了。所以他的密信全写得明明白白，句句清楚，没有半句“奴隶的语言”，他只有在讲假话的时候才使用“奴隶的语言”，那就是把“虚伪”说成“真诚”，把“狠毒”说成“仁爱”，把“打囚徒的鞭子”说成“人道主义”，用马克思主义的外衣来伪装他那“万物皆备于我”的“主观战斗精神”和“自我扩张”。他纵然有如簧的巧舌也难把白说成黑，所以他只好支支吾吾，吞吞吐吐，说些不像中国语言的话，写些不像中文的文章。居然有些年青人把它们当作经典，以为作者学问如何渊博，理论如何高深，这大半靠他的集团成员的吹嘘、捧场。他的集团成员对他们的主子是很忠心的。他们为着一个共同的目标奋斗：“动摇二十年的机械论的统治势力”。为了这个目标，他们甚至不惜跟“坏得很”或“立场不好”的报纸合作，而且“抱着与阵地共存亡的决心”，“决心打一年冲锋”，“且战且走，且打滚且作战”。胡风所谓“非常强大的”“敌人”就是党内和党外的进步文艺工作者。他们那个集团就是为了对付这些“敌人”而战斗的。所以在解放以后，在中华人民共和国成立以后，他还调兵遣将，“开辟工作”，建立据点，发展他们的文运。
    从这些“私房话”中已经可以看出这个大阴谋家的个人野心和权力欲望发展到了什么样的高度，也可以看出胡风的集团已经不是“小集团”，而是反党、反人民的反动集团了。他们一直带着藏刀的面具干那些打人不见伤的阴谋勾当。他们拿这些杀气腾腾、阴狠恶毒、口蜜腹剑的“私房话”当作“人的养料”来“互养”，一直养到了今天，想起来多可怕。胡风在“自我批判”中说：“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的。”读过了这句话之后再想起上面那些事情，更使人感到可怕了。
    写到这里，我又读到人民日报二十四日发表的
  “关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”。这全是胡风在解放以后写给他的集团分子的密信，自然也还只是密信中的一小部分。但是它们却把胡风的狰狞面目描画得更鲜明、更生动、更完全了。它们也给我们说明了更多的事情：胡风的一百八十度的大转变不过是“为了事业，为了更远大的未来！”这是他自己的话。说得明白一点，就是暂时退却，保存实力，等待时机，卷土重来。所以他重写“自我批判”的时候还一再嘱咐他那些集团分子要“冷静”、“沉着”，“在忍受中求得重生”。他是不甘心向党、向人民投降的。因为他在五年前就断定他们“会胜利”，而且还预定“以五年为期”。就在进攻失败以后，他也不会放下武器，因为他还有那末多的战术：譬如“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，“挖心战”，“神经战”，“点滴斗争”；他还有那末多的“战斗者”：那些名字真叫人吃惊！其中有些人谁也不曾疑心过他们是胡风集团分子（有些人甚至混入党内，充当胡风的坐探）；而且他还有那末些地盘：连党领导的新文艺出版社也成了他的集团的主要阵地；而且他还有那末严密的组织，有联络员，有“组织原则”，有计划；而且有一些机关里还有他的坐探，替他偷窃党内文件，探听情况。倘使这些情况不改变，倘使胡风还掌握了这许多有利的条件，他怎么不能卷土重来呢？
    事实上胡风已经卷土重来过一次了。他在一九五零年三月还说：“上海文坛被几个猛人驰骋着，我们出书出刊物都不可能”。可是在四年以后（一九五四年三月）他就写信命令上海新文艺出版社的编辑把“你们社成立以来，出了哪些坏书，为什么出了，出了哪些好书，出之前后，受了什么波折和打击。得开列一简单的表告诉我。”这时候不再是他们“出书不可能”（胡风、阿垅、路翎、冀汸、朱声、芦甸、罗洛……的书都先后由新文艺出版社刊行了），而是反对他们的人出书不能了，而是党所领导的出版社的编辑们为胡风服务，“帮”他“做工作”、收集材料、配合作战了。这时候胡风不再“装死”，他在“驰骋”新文艺出版社，指挥集团分子向人民的文艺事业猖狂进攻了。他这次的“冒进”虽然失败了，但也已经给人民的文艺事业带来了不小的损失。我们不应该忘记这个惨痛的教训。我们应该想到：就是在竖起假投降的白旗的时候，胡风也一定会记得他在四年前写过的句子：“我在磨我的剑，窥测方向，到我看准了的时候，我愿意割下我的头颅抛掷出去，把那个脏臭的铁壁击碎的。”我们能让胡风继续磨他的剑吗？全国人民能让胡风继续磨他的剑吗？当然不能！
    整个“第二批材料”中充满了阴谋家的恶毒的用心，他周密地布置工作，安排人事，扩大组织，争取地盘，甚至策动自己人化名投稿、写信布成“疑阵”威胁文艺报刊，为他摇旗呐喊，并指点集团分子，虚构事实，作虚伪检讨，蒙混过关。他们全部手段不外乎欺骗、虚假、利用、造谣，他的整个精神是“自我扩张”吹捧自己，咒骂别人。他吹自己的诗“惊住了一切人”。骂别人为“苍蝇蚊子”，“无耻”，“畜生”。除把毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”污蔑为“被当作了‘图腾’的小册子”，或者吹两三句他在文联和作协主席团联席扩大会议上发言外，很少见他谈理论谈学术，连他谈理论引用材料，也要新文艺出版社编辑给他帮忙。可见他除了散布仇恨、欺诈、虚伪的毒气（毒害别人也毒害自己）外，并没有什么渊博的学问和高深的理论。然而他那些集团分子却和他狼狈为奸，把他捧上领袖的地位，用他顶上的假的圆光来欺骗青年，扩大影响，加强实力，企图建立他们的“独立王国”。
    现在他们那些见不得人的企图完全暴露了。他们的阴谋活动已经引起了全国文艺界、文化界，甚至全国人民的普遍的愤慨。大家一致要求对胡风和他的反党反人民的集团彻底地进行斗争。以后自然还会有更多的“材料”揭露，然而单是这两批“材料”已经可以说明这个反动集团的罪行。斗争早已开始，我们必须彻底地打垮他整个集团，不让他们有卷土重来的机会。我们要完全揭穿他们的假面目，剥去他们的伪装，使这个集团的每一分子都从阴暗的角落里站出来，放下“橡皮包着钢丝的”鞭子和其他秘密武器，老老实实诚诚恳恳向党和人民投降，从此改过自新，重新作人。这是他们唯一的向人民赎罪的路。
