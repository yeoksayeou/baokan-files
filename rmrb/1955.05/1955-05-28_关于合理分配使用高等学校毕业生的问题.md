　　On the Rational Allocation and Use of University Graduates
　　Assistant Minister of Higher Education, Ding Hua
    Recently, newspapers and magazines have exposed the irrational allocation and use of university graduates and the waste of talent in some government organs and units. This is a problem that deserves our attention. In the past few years, I have been directly involved in the allocation of university graduates and have deeply felt that there are many shortcomings in our work. Here, I would like to put forward some immature opinions for discussion with all relevant parties. Based on the existing materials, there are more cases of irrational allocation and use of engineering graduates. Therefore, my discussion will focus on this aspect.

    First, let's talk about the shortcomings in the allocation and use of university graduates.

    Our shortcomings in the allocation work are that, in the preparation of the allocation plan, especially for the allocation of graduates of some new majors, we lacked a systematic and serious study of the use of graduates' majors and lacked the necessary understanding of the business of the employing departments. There have been events in which individual majors were wrongly allocated. For example, in the summer of 1953, due to a lack of understanding that some graduates of the motor manufacturing major of Northeast Institute of Technology were specifically trained for switchgear factories, they were allocated as general motor manufacturing majors. In the allocation work, we also did not do a good job in introducing the use of graduates' majors to the employing departments, so that they could better consider the allocation of graduates. There are also phenomena of carelessness and sloppiness in the work. For example, the name of the major was mistaken, which caused some unreasonable allocation. There are also many shortcomings in the adjustment of the work of graduates who are unreasonably allocated and used. Our attitude towards the adjustment of the work of some graduates is not firm enough; and we have not done a good job in promptly reflecting the waste of talent that we have learned to the relevant parties to promote the attention of all parties.

    The employing departments also have shortcomings in the allocation and use of university graduates. Although these shortcomings are not large in number, they are quite serious. The reasons for this phenomenon are multifaceted.

    First, on the issue of improving the planning of the allocation of university graduates.

    The irrational allocation and use of university graduates and the waste of talent are often caused by the inaccurate graduate needs plan and allocation plan proposed by some departments. Many employing units' proposed graduate needs plans often fail to reflect the actual needs. Some are due to a lack of understanding of the actual situation, and some believe that since it will be reduced during the actual allocation, it is better to propose more. Some employing departments do not have enough understanding of the actual needs of their subordinate units. When allocating graduates, they allocate more to those who need less and less to those who need more; units that urgently need graduates of a certain major are not assigned anyone, while those who do not currently need people are assigned people (or the allocation ratio is too unrealistic). Such a thing has happened: two engineering companies, in the same city, belong to the same central department's professional bureau. One company assigned graduates who studied heating and ventilation to other jobs; the other company, because there were no graduates who studied heating and ventilation, assigned graduates of other majors to work in heating and ventilation. There are similar situations in the allocation of university teaching assistants. For example, a certain school's surveying specialty has been abolished, but teaching assistants are still allocated to this specialty. Some employing departments also do not have enough understanding of the actual needs of key construction factories and mines, and allocate too many graduates to these factories and mines, or allocate production preparation personnel too early, which has caused a fairly serious phenomenon of talent backlog.

    It is undeniable that we lack experience in planning work and there are many difficulties. However, if we pay attention to a serious understanding of the actual needs, the aforementioned unreasonable phenomena are not impossible to reduce and avoid. In the future, all employing units should earnestly improve the work of formulating needs plans and allocation plans in the allocation of graduates. Improving planning can not only reduce the waste of talent, but also appropriately alleviate the tension of the lack of professional talent.

    Some employing units have no idea how many people they need and blindly propose needs plans. Some employing units, fearing that they will not get enough people, "reserve" graduates who are not currently needed but urgently needed by other units. Some employing units use more people than necessary, such as using two people when one person is enough. Of course, there is no planning in this. Naturally, the phenomenon of unreasonable use and waste of talent arises.

    Second, on the issue of combining the use of university graduates' majors with actual work needs.

    I believe that as long as we can carefully study the use of graduates' majors and the types of work required by our unit's business, and pay attention to combining the two well, we can reduce or avoid the unreasonable allocation, use and waste of talent. In the past, some units often did not study the use of graduates' majors enough, or allocated graduates' work only from the literal meaning of the major's name; some units lacked detailed research on the types of work required by their units' business, and only considered in general terms how many graduates who studied mechanical engineering or civil engineering should be allocated. As a result of this allocation, some graduates' professional knowledge and the actual needs of the work are not combined, thus wasting talent.

    It cannot be considered that the emergence of these shortcomings is due to "lack of experience and unfamiliarity with the business." The main reason for these shortcomings is the bureaucratic work style of not studying hard and not conducting serious investigations and research. Employing units generally have many experienced professional and technical personnel. If they are absorbed to participate in the allocation work, or if their opinions are humbly solicited, it is entirely possible to have a relatively in-depth understanding of the use of graduates' majors and allocate graduates' work according to the needs of the business.

    Some comrades believe that university graduates are "versatile talents" and can be allocated work according to major categories such as machinery and electrical engineering. This idea is wrong. They do not realize that in modern industrial construction, the division of labor in science and technology is very complex. Only by considering the use of professional talents according to the division of labor in science and technology is it possible to better utilize science and technology. In the future, the setting of university majors will become more detailed and perfect, and the technical types of industrial construction will become more and more complex. Therefore, only by deeply studying the use of majors, understanding the needs of the business, and carefully and meticulously considering the allocation of graduates' work can we avoid or reduce the phenomenon of waste of talent.

    The fact that the graduates' majors are not considered at all, and the graduates' work is arbitrarily assigned, and the attitude of not cherishing talents at all exists. Some comrades who are engaged in allocation work, based on the fact that some staff members had fought in the past, engaged in land reform, and are now engaged in industrial management, believe that it is possible to require some graduates to change careers and believe that it is reasonable. Such an analogy is obviously wrong.

    Third, on the issue of the direction of rational use of university graduates, especially engineering graduates.

    Industrial construction is multifaceted. In addition to design, construction, installation, and production, there are also many jobs that serve these tasks, such as equipment, materials, planning, safety, personnel, labor and wages, etc.; they are all indispensable, and in a certain sense, they are inseparable from technology and require people who participate in these tasks to understand production technology. However, some units overemphasize this point and believe that certain technical-related jobs must be done by technical personnel. This view is not appropriate enough.

    Everyone admits that any job in industrial construction has its importance, but this does not mean that the allocation of professional talents can be indiscriminate. At present, there is a great lack of professional talents. When allocating engineering graduates, we should first consider the needs of production and capital construction. We should allocate fewer people to equipment, materials, and other jobs, or even not allocate them at all. If we equate the needs of equipment, materials, and other jobs in industrial construction with the needs of production and capital construction, the result will relatively weaken production and capital construction. Moreover, in equipment, materials, and other jobs, many people with a certain level of education can be competent after studying for a period of time at work. Even if some of the work in equipment, materials, and other jobs must be done by technical personnel, we should specifically analyze whether university graduates or secondary technical school graduates are needed, or experienced technical personnel or workers with certain technical experience are needed. It is obviously inappropriate to generally emphasize that one cannot do all aspects of work in the industrial sector without understanding technology, and to allocate too many or inappropriately allocate university engineering graduates to do materials, equipment, and other work indiscriminately.

    It is also very unreasonable for some departments to allocate too many engineering graduates to work in central and local industrial management agencies. According to the allocation plans of various departments, when allocating university graduates in the summers of 1953 and 1954, the heavy industry departments allocated about one-fourth to one-half of the engineering graduates to work in central and local management agencies. Some larger factories and mines also have the phenomenon of retaining too many engineering graduates in the management agencies. In the early days of the founding of the country, it was necessary in a certain sense to allocate a certain number of engineering graduates to work in central and local management agencies; but with the annual allocation and more and more, the problems that followed became very obvious. Because the graduates allocated to the management agencies cannot get practical work experience, which affects the normal growth of technical strength. Some graduates reflect that due to the lack of production experience in enterprises, they cannot solve major technical problems in the management agencies, and there are no minor technical problems. Therefore, they only do copying, writing reports, and making forms, etc. They only use general industrial common sense and technical terms. Not only is the technical level not improved, but even some of the things they originally learned are quickly forgotten. At the same time, it should also be seen that there is a great lack of technical talents in production units (factories, mines, enterprises, etc.), and the technical personnel needed by the management agencies should have relatively rich production experience in enterprises. If too many engineering graduates are allocated to work in the management agencies, it will not only reduce the number of graduates allocated to production units, but also the management agencies will not be able to strengthen their leadership because of the lack of experienced technical personnel.

    I believe that engineering graduates should be allocated to work in grassroots industrial and mining units as much as possible, and the technical personnel needed by the management agencies should be gradually supplemented by transferring some experienced technical personnel from the production units. At present, the state organs are undergoing rectification, and it is time to transfer a group of engineering graduates who are currently working in the management agencies to grassroots industrial and mining units.

    Of course, there are many other reasons for the phenomenon of irrational allocation and use of university graduates and the waste of talent. For example, some units know that it is not suitable for certain graduates to work in their units, but they still adopt a localist approach and believe that "more people are better than fewer people," allowing the unreasonable phenomenon to continue to exist, etc. However, the above three aspects are the main reasons. If we effectively improve the planning of the allocation of graduates' work; seriously study the use of graduates' majors and the types of work required by our unit's business and combine the two well; and clearly recognize the direction of graduates' use; then, the phenomenon of irrational allocation and use of graduates and the waste of talent will be greatly reduced.

    Opposing the unreasonable allocation and use of university graduates and the waste of talent, while requiring the allocation of work according to the graduates' professional knowledge, we must also clearly recognize the combination of learning and application in the graduates' work, and consider it according to the complex actual situation.

    The allocation of university graduates should be considered according to the graduates' majors and the actual needs of the country. However, it is difficult to have a very accurate understanding of the actual needs several years later when the plan for university talent cultivation is determined several years before the actual allocation of graduates. Moreover, the national construction plan will inevitably be revised in the process of practice, and the national needs for professional talents will inevitably change considerably after several years. In the process of national construction, due to the development of technology, some new technical types will be produced, and some new professional talents will be needed. In this regard, the work of cultivating talents often lags behind the actual needs. At the same time, limited by the conditions of the universities themselves (teachers, equipment, etc.), the plan for cultivating professional talents should not only be formulated according to needs, but also be considered in combination with possibilities. Of course, there are still many shortcomings in the work of formulating the cultivation plan that need to be improved to make the plan closer to reality.

    Therefore, the number and proportion of various professional talents cultivated by universities can only roughly meet the needs of various aspects of national construction, and it is impossible to fully meet the actual needs of the country. In a certain sense, the proportion of the number of various majors in the plan for cultivating talents in universities should be closely matched to each other like the various parts of a machine; however, it is very difficult to require the cultivation plan to be as accurate as the thousands of parts of a machine, installed without any difference.

    In the actual allocation work, the number of graduates in some majors is very different from the number of cadres urgently needed by the country in this regard; or, universities have not yet cultivated some urgently needed professional talents. Under these circumstances, it is entirely necessary to allocate graduates of majors with similar properties to do work in this area. For example, in 1952, we did not have graduates majoring in physical prospecting. Due to the urgent need for geological exploration work, we had to allocate a part of the graduates from the physics department of comprehensive universities to do geophysical prospecting work at that time. However, it is a very complex issue to allocate graduates of which major to change careers to adapt to the needs of a certain aspect. It is necessary to carefully study and handle it according to the needs of the work and the use of the graduates' majors. It is helpful to consult with Soviet experts, professors, and engineers more on this issue. In the past, some graduates were improperly changed careers due to a lack of thorough research. For example, for the urgent needs of the machinery manufacturing industry, we once allocated part of the graduates who studied the use, maintenance, and repair of agricultural machinery to do machinery manufacturing work when formulating the allocation plan, but in fact, they were not competent. Some departments, for the needs of non-ferrous metal smelting, once allocated part of the graduates majoring in foundry to do aluminum smelting work, which proved to be inappropriate. If the graduates are changed to an improper career, it is not only a problem of unreasonable use, but also because the graduates cannot be competent for the work they are engaged in, they cannot actually adapt to the needs of the work, which is also detrimental to the work.

    On the other hand, there are also some majors whose number of graduates exceeds the needs of the country at that time, so they can only be allocated to do work with similar properties to their majors or even work that is far from the properties of their majors. It is unavoidable to do this, and it is reasonable from the specific situation; it is difficult to do it in practice if the principle of "consistency of learning and application" is mechanically required for the allocation of work.

    From the overall situation, the graduates who have to change careers due to the needs of the country are only a very small part after all; and this approach is unavoidable. Therefore, I think they can generally understand the explanation of the national needs and the principle of obeying the national needs to these graduates. However, some people only emphasize obeying the needs of the work, but do not pay attention to the "consistency of learning and application" and the issue of rational use, and call on graduates to "establish the idea of changing careers." I think this is a one-sided view.

    The Party and the government have repeatedly pointed out that the allocation of university graduates should "implement the principle of 'consistency of learning and application' on the basis of national needs," which is completely correct. The allocation work departments and the employing units should not one-sidedly emphasize the needs of the work and rashly let the graduates change careers without careful study. On the other hand, graduates should realize that it is also unrealistic to require each graduate's work to achieve "consistency of learning and application" at present. We should combine national needs and "consistency of learning and application" well, and not consider the issue solely from the perspective of personal gains and losses (such as interests, prospects, treatment, etc.).

    Finally, let's talk about the criticisms that newspapers and magazines have made of us and the employing departments. There is no doubt that we should adopt a welcoming and sincere attitude towards such criticisms and earnestly examine our own work. At the same time, we must also realize that dealing with these issues specifically is a very complex task that cannot be completely resolved after one examination. It requires continuous exposure of shortcomings and continuous improvement of work in the future.

    Many graduates have also put forward many opinions on their work, which is a good phenomenon. It should be said that the vast majority of graduates who put forward opinions on the allocation of work are out of patriotic enthusiasm and want to better contribute their professional knowledge to the construction of the motherland. They should be encouraged and welcomed. The graduates' opinions should be regarded as supervision of our work, which is of great benefit to improving our work. After hearing the graduates' opinions, the employing units should first check their own work to see if there are any phenomena of unreasonable use and waste of talent. It is obviously a prejudice to think that it is a "ideological problem" as soon as the graduates raise opinions. Some comrades believe that even if the graduates' work is not properly allocated, they should still do their current work well and wait for the leaders and the surrounding comrades to discover their talents. Of course, it is right to do the current work well. As for waiting for the leaders and comrades to discover their talents, the implication is that they should not raise opinions even if the work is not properly allocated. Obviously, this view is incorrect. If we do this, we cannot broaden the channels of communication, and we will actually reject the graduates' criticisms and suggestions on our work, which will hinder us from further improving our work.

    We should not only listen to the graduates' opinions, but also encourage them to raise opinions and actively check our own work, and actively adjust the graduates whose work allocation is not appropriate. In the past, we have not done enough work in this area. It is recommended that various employing departments conduct a serious inspection of the use of university graduates by their subordinate units, and pay attention to correcting the phenomenon of unreasonable use and waste of talent of university graduates.

    It should be said that with criticism and supervision, and with our own serious inspection, we can further improve the allocation of university graduates.

    Of course, the graduates' opinions should be analyzed realistically; if they are reasonable, they should be given appropriate solutions as much as possible. However, some of the opinions put forward by the graduates are inevitably somewhat inappropriate, such as having a one-sided and narrow view of the principle of "consistency of learning and application," and even some are mixed with personal plans when raising opinions, etc. We should give them patient explanations and persuasion.

    The university graduates of the summer of 1955 are about to leave school. In order to enable them to play their light and heat for the socialist construction of the motherland in suitable work positions, we must overcome the shortcomings in our past work and improve the allocation work one step further.

　　关于合理分配使用高等学校毕业生的问题
　　高等教育部部长助理　丁华
    近来，报纸杂志揭发了某些机关、单位对高等学校毕业生分配、使用不合理和浪费人材的现象。这是一个值得我们重视的问题。几年来，我直接参与了高等学校毕业生的分配工作，深深感到在工作中存在着不少缺点。在这里愿意提出一些不成熟的意见来同各有关方面商讨。根据现有的材料，对工科毕业生分配、使用不合理的情况比较多，因此，我所谈的也着重在这个方面。一
    首先来谈一谈分配、使用高等学校毕业生工作中的缺点。
    我们在分配工作中的缺点是，在拟制分配计划时，特别是对于某些新的专业的毕业生的分配，由于对毕业生所学专业的用途缺乏系统的、认真的研究，对用人部门的业务缺乏必要的了解，曾经有过将个别专业的毕业生分配错了的事件。例如，一九五三年暑期由于不了解东北工学院电机制造专业部分毕业生是专为开关制造厂培养的，而当作一般电机制造专业的毕业生分配了工作。在分配工作中，也没有很好地向用人部门介绍毕业生专业的用途，以便于他们更好地考虑分配毕业生的工作。工作中也还有疏忽大意、粗枝大叶的现象。例如曾把专业名称弄错了因而造成某些分配不合理的现象。在对于分配、使用不合理的毕业生的工作调整方面，也有不少缺点。对某些毕业生工作的调整，态度不够坚决；也没有很好地将我们所了解到的浪费人材的现象及时反映到有关方面，以促使各方面的注意。
    用人部门对高等学校毕业生的分配、使用，也是有缺点的。这种缺点虽然不是大量的，但是相当严重的。造成这种现象的原因，是多方面的。
    第一，关于提高对高等学校毕业生工作分配的计划性问题。
    对高等学校毕业生分配、使用不合理和浪费人材的现象，常常是由于有些部门所提毕业生需要计划和配备计划不准确而产生的。不少的用人单位提出的毕业生需要计划，往往不能反映实际的需要情况。有的是由于对实际情况还不了解，有的是认为反正在实际分配时要削减，不如多提一些。有的用人部门对于所属各单位的实际需要情况了解不够，在配备毕业生时，对需要少的配备多了，对需要多的却配备少了；迫切需要某个专业的毕业生的单位，没有分配人去，对目前不需要人的，反而分配去了
  （或分配的比例太不切实际）。曾经发生过这样的事情：两个工程公司，同在一个城市，又属于同一个中央部门的专业局。一个公司分配学暖气通风的毕业生改行作了别的工作；另一个公司由于没有学暖气通风的毕业生，却分配了其他专业的毕业生改行作暖气通风工作。高等学校助教的配备，也有类似的情况，如某校测量专修科已经撤销，还为这个专修科配备助教。也有些用人部门对于重点建设的厂矿的实际需要情况了解不够，过多地配备毕业生给这些厂矿，或过早地配备生产准备人员，都曾经造成相当严重的积压人材的现象。
    不可否认，我们在计划工作方面经验不足，困难很多。但是，如果我们对于实际需要情况注意进行认真的了解，前述的那些不合理现象不是不可能减少和避免的。各用人单位今后在毕业生分配工作中应该切实改进需要计划和配备计划的拟订工作。计划性提高了，对于用人单位来说，不仅可以减少浪费人材的现象，还可以适当地减轻缺乏专业人材的紧张情况。
    有的用人单位对于本单位需要的人数心中无底，盲目地提出需要计划。有的用人单位唯恐要不到人，把目前不需要而其他单位迫切需要的毕业生
  “储备”起来，有的用人单位不必要地多用人，如用一个人就可以的，却要用两个人。当然，这就谈不到什么计划性了。很自然，不合理使用和浪费人材的现象便随之而产生了。
    第二，关于高等学校毕业生所学专业用途同实际工作需要相结合的问题。
    我认为，只要能认真地研究毕业生所学专业的用途和本单位业务所需的工种，并注意把两者很好地结合起来，就可以减少或避免分配、使用不合理和浪费人材的现象。过去，有的单位往往对毕业生专业用途研究不够或仅从专业名称顾名思义地来分配毕业生的工作；有的单位对于本单位业务所需的工种缺乏细致的研究，仅仅笼统地考虑要配备多少学机械或学土木的毕业生。这样分配的结果，有的毕业生所学的专业知识和工作的实际需要就结合不上，因而浪费了人材。
    不能认为这些缺点的产生是由于“缺乏经验、业务不熟悉”。产生这些缺点的原因，主要是由于不好好学习、不认真调查研究的官僚主义作风。用人的单位一般都有许多有经验的各种专业技术人员，如果吸收他们参加分配工作，或者虚心地征询一下他们的意见，就完全有可能比较深入地了解毕业生所学专业的用途，并根据业务的需要来分配毕业生的工作。
    有的同志认为，高等学校毕业生是“通材”，只须按照机械、电机等大类分配工作就可以。这种想法是不对的。他们没有认识到，在现代化的工业建设中，科学技术的分工是十分复杂的，只有根据科学技术的分工来考虑专业人材的使用，才有可能更好地利用科学技术。今后，高等学校专业设置日益细致和完善，工业建设的技术工种越来越复杂。因此，只有深入研究专业用途，了解业务的需要，慎重、细致地考虑分配毕业生的工作，才能避免或减少浪费人材的现象。
    根本不考虑毕业生的专业，随便分配毕业生的工作，对人材采取毫不爱惜的态度的事实是存在的。有的作分配工作的同志，根据某些工作人员过去曾经打过仗、搞过土地改革，现在又做工业管理工作的事实，认为可以要求某些毕业生改行，并且认为是合理的。这样的比拟显然是错误的。
    第三，关于高等学校毕业生，特别是工科毕业生的合理使用的方向问题。
    工业建设是多方面的，设计、建筑、安装、生产之外，还有许多为这些工作服务的工作，如设备、材料、计划、安全、人事、劳动工资，等等；它们也都是不可缺少的，在一定意义上也都离不开技术，需要参加这些工作的人懂得生产技术。但是，有的单位却过于强调了这一点，认为某些同技术有关的工作必须由技术人员来作。这种看法是不够妥当的。
    工业建设中的任何工作都有它的重要性，这是大家都承认的，但这并不能说配备专业人材可以不分主次。目前专业人材还十分缺乏，在配备工科毕业生时，应该首先考虑生产和基本建设的需要，对于设备、材料等工作，应该少配备一些，有的甚至不配备。如果把工业建设中的设备、材料等工作的需要和生产、基本建设的需要相提并论，其结果，就会相对削弱生产和基本建设。而且，设备、材料等工作中，不少是具有一定文化水平的人在工作中学习一段时间就可以胜任的。即使设备、材料等工作中有一部分工作必须技术人员去做，也应该具体分析一下，究竟需要高等学校毕业生或中等技术学校毕业生，还是需要有经验的技术人员或有一定技术经验的工人。如果笼统地强调不懂技术就做不了工业部门各方面的工作，不分主次，过多地或不适当地分配高等学校工科毕业生去做材料、设备等工作，显然是不妥当的。
    有的部门分配过多的工科毕业生在中央和地方的工业管理机关工作，也是很不合理的。根据各部门的配备计划统计，一九五三、一九五四两年暑期分配高等学校毕业生时，重工业各部门分配了约四分之一至二分之一的工科毕业生在中央和地方的管理机关工作。有一些较大的厂矿也有把工科毕业生过多地留在管理机关的现象。建国初期分配一定数量的工科毕业生到中央和地方的管理机关工作，在一定的意义上说是必要的；但年年分配，越来越多，随之而来的问题也就暴露得很明显了。由于分配在管理机关的毕业生得不到实际工作的锻炼，影响了技术力量的正常生长。有的毕业生反映，由于缺乏企业的生产经验，在管理机关工作，大的技术问题解决不了，小的技术问题也没有，因而只是作些抄写、写报告、做表报等工作，用到的只是一般的工业常识和技术名词，不但技术水平提不高，甚至原来学的一些东西也快忘掉了。同时还应该看到，目前生产单位（厂、矿、企业等）技术人材十分缺乏，而管理机关需要的技术人员应该具有比较丰富的企业的生产经验，如果把过多的工科毕业生分配在管理机关工作，既减少了分配给生产单位的毕业生人数，管理机关也会由于缺乏有经验的技术人员而领导力量并不能加强。
    我认为，应该尽可能地将工科毕业生分配到工矿基层单位工作，管理机关所需要的技术人员则应逐步从生产单位抽调部分有经验的技术人员来补充。目前，国家机关正在进行整编工作，抽调一批现在管理机关工作的工科毕业生到工矿基层单位去，现在是时候了。
    当然，产生对高等学校毕业生分配、使用不合理和浪费人材的现象，还有许多其他的原因。例如，有的单位明知某些毕业生在本单位工作是不适合的，但仍然采取本位主义的作法，认为“多一个人比少一个人好”，听任不合理的现象继续存在等等。但是，上面所说的三方面的原因是主要的，如果我们切实提高对毕业生工作分配的计划性；认真研究毕业生所学专业的用途和本单位业务所需的工种并把两者很好地结合起来；明确认识毕业生的使用方向；那末，对毕业生分配、使用不合理和浪费人材的现象是会大大减少的。二
    反对不合理分配、使用高等学校毕业生和浪费人材的现象，要求按照毕业生所学的专业知识来分配工作的同时，还要明确认识毕业生在工作中学与用的结合，应该根据复杂的实际情况来考虑。
    高等学校毕业生的分配应该按照毕业生所学专业和国家的实际需要来考虑，但是，高等学校培养人材的计划要在实际分配毕业生的前几年确定，对于几年以后的实际需要情况要有很确切的了解，是有困难的。况且，国家建设计划也难免要在实践的过程中进行修订，国家对于专业人材的需要情况在相隔几年之后也必然会有相当大的变动。国家建设过程中，由于技术的发展，会产生某些新的技术工种，需要一些新的专业人材，在这方面，培养人材的工作往往落后于实际的需要。同时，限于高等学校本身的条件（师资、设备等），培养专业人材的计划不仅要根据需要来制定，而且也要结合可能来考虑。当然，在拟订培养计划的工作中，也还有许多缺点需要改进，使计划更接近于实际。
    因此，高等学校培养的各种专业人材的人数和比例，只能大体上符合国家建设各方面的需要，而不可能完全符合国家的实际需要。在一定意义上说，高等学校培养人材的计划的各个专业人数的比例，应该像一架机器的各个部分一样互相紧密配合；但是，如果要求培养计划像一架机器的千百个零件一样，安装起来一丝一毫不差地那样准确，那是很困难的。
    在实际分配工作时，有的专业的毕业生人数同国家在这方面工作迫切需要的干部数量相比较，相差很多；或者，高等学校暂时还没有培养出某些急需的专业人材。在这些情况下，分配一些性质相近的专业的毕业生来作这方面的工作，是完全必要的。例如，在一九五二年时我们还没有物理探矿专业的毕业生，由于地质勘探工作的迫切需要，当时就不得不分配了一部分综合大学物理系的毕业生去作地球物理探矿工作。但是，分配什么专业的毕业生改行去适应某一方面的需要较为合适，确是一个十分复杂的问题，必须根据工作的需要和毕业生的专业用途慎重地研究和处理。在这个问题上，多请教苏联专家、教授和工程师是有好处的。过去，曾经因为缺乏缜密的研究，使某些毕业生作了不适当的改行。例如，为了机械制造工业的迫切需要，我们在拟制分配计划时曾经分配了部分学使用、维护和修理农业机械的毕业生去作机械制造工作，实际上他们是不能胜任的。有的部门，为了有色金属冶炼的需要，曾经分配了部分铸工专业的毕业生去作铝冶炼的工作，事实证明也是不妥当的。毕业生改行改得不妥当，不仅是使用不合理的问题，而且，由于毕业生不能胜任所担任的工作，实际上并不能适应工作的需要，对工作也是不利的。
    另一方面，也有某些专业的毕业生人数超过国家当时的需要，就只能分配他们作同所学专业性质相近的工作或甚至同所学专业性质相距较远的工作。这样作，是不得已的，从具体情况看来也是合理的；如果机械地要求按“学用一致”原则分配工作，事实上是难以办到的。
    从总的情况看来，由于国家的需要必须改行的毕业生，毕竟是极少一部分；而且，这样的作法是不得已的。所以向这些毕业生说明国家需要的情况和服从国家需要的道理，我想他们一般是能想通的。但是，有的人只强调服从工作需要，却不注意
  “学用一致”和合理使用问题，号召毕业生要“树立改行思想”。我认为这是一种片面的看法。
    党和政府曾一再指出，对于高等学校毕业生的分配应“在国家需要的基础上贯彻‘学用一致’原则”，这是完全正确的。分配工作部门和用人的单位不应该片面地强调工作的需要，不经过慎重研究就轻率地让毕业生改行。另一方面，毕业生应该认识到，目前要求每个毕业生的工作都作到“学用一致”，也是不切实际的。我们应该把国家需要和
  “学用一致”很好地结合起来，不要光从个人的得失（如兴趣、前途、待遇等）出发来考虑问题。
    最后，谈一谈报纸、杂志对我们和用人部门所提出的批评。毫无疑问，我们对这样的批评应该采取欢迎和诚恳接受的态度，认真地检查自己的工作。同时，也要认识到，具体处理这些问题，是一件十分复杂的工作，不是经过一次检查就可以彻底解决的，需要今后不断地揭发缺点，不断地改进工作。
    许多毕业生对自己的工作也提出了不少的意见，这是很好的现象。应该说，绝大部分对工作分配提出意见的毕业生，是出于爱国热忱，想更好地把自己所学到的专业知识贡献给祖国的建设事业，应该受到鼓励和欢迎。对于毕业生的意见，应该看成是对我们工作的监督，对于改进我们的工作有很大的好处。听到毕业生的意见以后，各用人的单位应该首先检查自己的工作，看看是否有使用不合理和浪费人材的现象。毕业生一提意见，就认为是“思想问题”，那显然是一种偏见。有的同志认为，毕业生的工作即使分配得不恰当，仍应当做好当前的工作，等待领导人员和周围的同志发现他们的才能。当然，做好当前的工作是对的，至于等待领导人员和同志来发现他们的才能，那言外之意是，工作分配得不恰当，也不应该提意见。显然，这种看法是不正确的。这样作，就不能广开言路，就会在实际上拒绝毕业生对我们工作的批评和建议，阻碍我们进一步地改进工作。
    我们不仅要倾听毕业生的意见，还要鼓励他们提意见，主动地检查自己的工作，对于工作分配不恰当的毕业生主动地加以调整。过去，我们在这方面的工作是作得不够的。建议各用人部门对所属各单位使用高等学校毕业生的情况进行认真的检查，注意纠正对高等学校毕业生使用不合理和浪费人材的现象。
    应该说，有了批评和监督，有了我们自己的认真检查，我们就可以进一步作好高等学校毕业生的分配工作。
    当然，对于毕业生的意见，应该实事求是地加以分析；如果是合理的，应当尽可能地给以适当解决。但是，有些毕业生提出的意见，也难免还有些不够妥当的地方，譬如对“学用一致”的原则有片面、狭隘的看法，甚至有的在提意见时掺杂着个人打算，等等，我们应该对他们进行耐心的解释和说服。　　
    一九五五年暑期高等学校毕业生快要离校了。为了使他们能在合适的工作岗位上，为祖国的社会主义建设事业发挥他们的光和热，我们必须克服过去工作中的缺点，把分配工作提高一步。
