　　Electric Pumping Station in Anshan Township

    Anshan Township in Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, is an ordinary village on the southeast coast of our motherland. Now, on a vast field of more than 10,600 mu, two rows of brand-new electric poles have been erected, and large and small canals of 28 li in length have been opened up. Six light blue pumping stations have appeared on the banks of the Yao River, with seven electric motors installed inside. People only need to flip a switch, and in four days and four nights, they can irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land in the entire irrigation area. At night, in the assembly hall of the Anshan Agricultural Production Cooperative, in the station building of the electric pumping station, and in the office of the township people's government, there is bright electric light everywhere.

    This electric pumping station started construction in February this year. During the construction period, farmers from far and near actively participated, and the farmers of Anshan built their hometown with the greatest enthusiasm. On the day of erecting the electric poles, a 63-year-old man from the Anshan Agricultural Production Cooperative also came out to carry the poles. When young people advised him to take a rest, he refused and said, "When have we ever carried such things? Without the leadership of Chairman Mao, how could there be such a good thing to do?" On the day of installing the electric motor, old cooperative member Zhou Jintu also came to participate! When others told him that this thing would replace the old ox in driving water, he happily touched the electric motor and said, "Treasure! Treasure!"

    Indeed, they should be happy. Anshan Township is a live water river, and irrigation depends on the night tide. In the past, people were extremely tired after working all day, and they had to get up before dawn or in the middle of the night to catch water. Now that there are pumping stations, the water will be quickly sent to the fields at night as long as the pumping station operators start the electric motors in the machine room.

    They calculated that after the establishment of the pumping station, the whole township can expand the planting of 2,040 mu of continuous cropping rice this year, and 300 mu of single-season rice can be changed to double-season rice. The use of electricity instead of manual water irrigation can save 9,000 laborers for intensive cultivation, so that the whole township can increase production by 500,000 jin of grain this year.

    The establishment of the electric pumping station has further inspired the production enthusiasm of the farmers in Anshan Township. Now they are actively carrying out spring plowing, striving to increase grain and industrial raw material production to support industrial construction.

　　鞍山乡的电力抽水机站
　　穆崇德
    浙江余姚县鞍山乡是祖国东南沿海的一个普通村庄。现在，在这里一片一万零六百多亩的广阔田野上，已经竖起两排崭新的电线杆，开辟了纵横二十八里的大小渠道，在姚江的两岸上出现了六幢淡蓝色的抽水机机埠，里面安装了七台电动机。人们只要把电钮一扳，在四天四夜的时间里，就能够把全灌区的一万多亩土地灌上了水。夜间，在鞍山农业生产合作社的大会场里，在电力抽水机站的站房里，在乡人民政府的办公室里，到处都是一片雪亮的电灯光。
    这个电力抽水机站是今年二月开始建筑的，建站期间，远近农民都踊跃参加，鞍山农民更以最大的热情来建设自己的家乡。架电线杆子那天，鞍山农业生产合作社的一个六十三岁的老大爷也出来抬电杆，青年人劝他憩憩，他拒绝说：“我们啥时候抬过这种东西，没有毛主席领导，那有这样的好事做。”装电动机那天，老社员周金土也来参加了！当别人告诉他：以后就是由那玩意儿来代替老牛赶水，他高兴地摸着电动机说：“宝贝！宝贝！”
    的确，他们是应该高兴的。鞍山乡那里是活水河，灌田都靠夜潮水，过去，人们干了一天的活已经疲倦极了，还得起五更，睡半夜地去赶水。现在有了抽水机，夜里只要抽水机手们在机房内把电动机一发动，水就会很快地送到田里了。
    他们算了算：建立抽水机站后，今年全乡可以扩种二千零四十亩连作稻，可以把三百亩单季稻改为双季稻，电力代替了人力灌水，可以省下九千个劳动力，用在精耕细作上，这样全乡今年就可增产五十万斤粮食。
    电力抽水机站的建立，更鼓舞了鞍山乡的农民的生产热情，现在他们正在积极进行春耕生产，努力增产粮食和工业原料，支援工业建设。
