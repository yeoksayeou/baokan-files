　　Severely Punish Hu Feng
　　Ma Yanxiang
    Hu Feng, this shameless schemer, has mixed into our literary and art ranks, secretly engaging in organized and planned counter-revolutionary activities. Whether he was in Chongqing, Shanghai, or Beijing, he never for a moment relaxed or stopped mobilizing his anti-Party clique to launch a frenzied attack on the Chinese Communist Party. He called on his followers to not "ease up" in order to "shake the ruling forces of two decades of mechanism." As for himself, he was constantly "sharpening his sword," "watching for the direction," preparing to shatter the "iron wall" in one blow when he "saw the opportunity." He believed they "would be victorious." Isn't that clear enough? To what extent has Hu Feng's vile and sinister anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary ambition "expanded"!

    For more than a decade, in order to expand his "strength," Hu Feng constantly "strove for people," "contacted people," "engaged in pioneering work," and developed "strongholds." In order to facilitate the attack on the Party and on the people's literary and artistic cause, Hu Feng adopted the "Sun Wukong entering the stomach tactic," arranging for his followers to infiltrate the Party, infiltrate various literary and art organizations, to gather information and steal Party documents. In order to "fight" the Party, Hu Feng often hid in his headquarters, strategizing and directing his followers on how to "carry out 'excavation warfare' theoretically," how to break through "gaps," how to "read some Marxism-Leninism and Soviet literary theory and criticism, in order to 'stand firm' on 'stance' in terms of 'wording'," how to "collect materials," how to "be vigilant about 'attitude' issues"... When his and his group's attacks suffered setbacks or failures, he would arrange for retreat in order to bide his time, teaching his followers "to face reality, cherish strength," "not to have any unnecessary casualties in the process of striving for a turnaround," "rather stay in a cave with bad air to 'preserve strength'," "only to seek rebirth in endurance," and so on. Such an anti-Party, anti-people group, such a counter-revolutionary organization, has been around us for a long time, right in front of us. They put on all sorts of faces and poses to deal with us, while secretly engaging in counter-revolutionary activities that undermine our country's socialist construction. The thought that such insidious enemies have been mixed in among us for so long is truly chilling. But concealment cannot last long, and the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Hu Feng group have finally been exposed. In addition to fully supporting the five resolutions of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association at their joint enlarged meeting on May 25, I also suggest that the government severely punish Hu Feng according to the law!

　　严惩胡风
　　马彦祥
    胡风这个无耻的阴谋家混在我们的文艺阵营里，鬼鬼祟祟地干着有组织、有计划的反革命活动。无论当他在重庆、在上海或在北京的时候，他从来没有一刻放松过、停止过动员他的反党集团向中国共产党进行疯狂的进攻。他号召他的党羽们为了“动摇二十年的机械论的统治势力”，万万
  “松不得劲”。他自己呢，随时在“磨我的剑”，在“窥测方向”，准备在“看准了的时候”，一下子就击碎“铁壁”。他相信他们“会胜利”的。这难道还不够明白么？胡风的卑鄙、阴狠的反党、反人民、反革命的野心已经“扩张”到了什么地步！
    十几年来，胡风为了扩充他的“实力”，不断地在“争取人”，“联络人”，“从事开辟工作”，发展“据点”。胡风为了便于向党进攻，向人民的文艺事业进攻，采用了“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，布置他的党羽混进党内，混进各个文艺团体内，探听情况，窃取党内文件。胡风为了和党“作战”，经常隐蔽在他的司令部里，运筹帷幄，指挥他的党羽如何“从理论上去做‘挖心战’”，如何冲破“缺口”，如何“看些马列主义和苏联的文艺理论批评，为了‘字面’上要站稳‘立场’”，如何
  “收集材料”，如何“警惕‘态度’问题”……当他和他的集团进攻受到挫折或失败以后，又如何布置退却，以便伺机再起，教导他的党羽“要正视现实，爱惜力量”，“在争取转机之中，不能有一点不必要的伤亡”，“宁愿在空气坏的洞中多待，‘保存力量’”，“只有在忍受中求得重生”等等。这样的一个反党、反人民的集团，这样的一个反革命组织，长期以来就在我们的身边，就在我们的面前，他们一面装扮着各种各样的面貌和姿态，和我们周旋，一面在暗中做着破坏我国社会主义建设的反革命活动。这样阴险的敌人竟长期混在我们中间，想起来真令人有不寒而栗之感。但是隐瞒是不能持久的，胡风集团的反革命罪行终于被揭露了。我除了完全拥护五月二十五日中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的五项决议外，并建议政府，依照法律给胡风以严惩！
