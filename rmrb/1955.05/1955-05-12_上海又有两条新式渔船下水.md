　　Shanghai Adds Two New-Style Fishing Vessels

　　The Shanghai Joint State-Private Operated Zhonghua Shipyard recently manufactured two new-style fishing boats - hybrid fishing vessels. The first one was launched on April 23rd and is currently being fitted with machinery. It is expected to be test-sailed and put into production by the end of June. The second one was launched on May 9th.

　　These two new-style fishing vessels were manufactured by drawing on the practical experience of the crew and the advantages of various types of fishing vessels. Its total displacement is more than 240 tons, and it can load more than 160,000 catties of fish each time, making it one of the larger fishing vessels in our country. General fishing boats can only use pair trawling or stern trawling (single trawling) methods for fishing. This type of fishing boat can use both methods. During the fish season, pair trawling can be used, and single trawling can be used when it is cold. This greatly improves operational efficiency. The operation of the main machinery of this fishing boat is carried out in the wheelhouse. Navigators can directly control the machinery according to the sailing conditions and work needs of the fishing boat, which is much more convenient than controlling the machinery through the engine room staff of general fishing boats. The cable winch on the ship is also electric, which reduces the physical labor of the crew. The ship is also equipped with employee accommodation and cultural and recreational facilities to meet the needs of long-distance fishing. (Our correspondent in Shanghai)

　　上海又有两条新式渔船下水
    上海公私合营中华造船厂最近又制造了两条新式捕鱼船——混合式渔船。第一艘已经在四月二十三日下水，目前正在安装机器，六月底即可试航投入生产。第二艘也已经在五月九日下水。
    这两条新式渔船是吸取船员们平时实际操作经验和各式渔船的优点制造的。它的总排水量有二百四十多吨，每次可装鱼十六万斤以上，是目前我国较大的渔船。一般的渔船只能分别用对拖或尾拖（单拖）的方法捕鱼，这种渔船两种方法都可使用，鱼汛期间可以对拖，天冷时可以单拖。这样就大大提高了作业效率。这种渔船主要机器的操作都在驾驶室内进行。驾驶人员可以根据渔船航行情形和工作需要，直接控制机器，比一般渔船通过机舱工作人员控制机器方便得多。船上的卷缆机也是电动的，为船员们减轻了体力劳动。船上还设有职工住宿和文化娱乐设备，能够满足远航捕鱼时的需要。（本报驻上海记者）
