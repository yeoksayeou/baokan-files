Letters from Geng Shijie and Feng Junshi of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant: We are workers in the power department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. We express our boundless anger in denouncing Hu Feng, this extremely insidious and vicious anti-Party and anti-people scoundrel.

　　We were not familiar with Hu Feng in the past, and we have not read his articles. But now we recognize him. He is an anti-Party and anti-people conspirator. For twenty years, he has been deceiving the people, posing as a revolutionary and progressive writer, and today he has been exposed by the people.

　　His hatred of the Party, the people, and the revolution has reached a point of madness. He cursed and slandered our great Chinese Communist Party. His so-called "revolution" was to "sharpen my sword and peer in the direction" and to carry out counter-revolutionary activities "using Sun Wukong's tactic of drilling into the belly." After his attack on the Party failed, he then arranged retreat tactics for his group members, attempting to continue using double-dealing methods to preserve their "strength" and wait for an opportunity to rise again.

　　Hu Feng, your conspiracy will never succeed! Our Party is as solid as a rock, our eyes are sharp, and our working class ranks are strong. Any reactionary force is bound to die!

　　Letter from Fang Yunpeng of Xin Yu Station, Jiangxi Province: I am a railway worker. In recent days, the Party newspaper has exposed the Hu Feng anti-Party group's conspiracy, and I feel it is correct and necessary. In order to defend the socialist construction of the motherland and the fruits of victory of the working people, we must expose those hidden enemies wearing false faces and eliminate them. I wholeheartedly support the exposure of the Hu Feng group and demand that this counter-revolutionary group be completely crushed.

　　Letter from Deng Shihua of Jinxi Chemical Plant: From the two batches of materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party group published in the "People's Daily," it can be clearly seen that Hu Feng and his anti-Party group have been standing on the counter-revolutionary side, opposing the Party and the people, for more than twenty years. The various despicable conspiracies of his anti-Party group are the same in nature as the activities of the American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. Therefore, he should be severely punished!

　　I work in a workshop in a chemical plant. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our working class and working people are working diligently to build socialism. We will never allow the restoration of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime, but Hu Feng wants to wait for the arrival of "opportunities." This shows that even when he wrote that fake "My Self-Criticism," he still hated the revolution. Hu Feng, the "opportunity" you are waiting for will never come. Give up!

　　Letter from Cai Zhaocai of Shenyang State-Owned Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory: I am a pharmaceutical worker. Although I am not highly educated, I can see from the materials about the Hu Feng group exposed in the newspapers that Hu Feng is an extremely wicked counter-revolutionary element, the most insidious saboteur among enemies of all stripes. I wholeheartedly support the handling of Hu Feng by the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, and I suggest that relevant departments punish him according to law.

　　Letter from Zhang Gengshu, leader of the engraving industry study group in Xiacheng District, Hangzhou: From those secret letters from Hu Feng to the members of his group, it can be clearly seen how Hu Feng used despicable means to "contact people" and "win over people" to expand his "strength" and carry out anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. What is the difference between his sneaky conspiracies and the methods of American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents? I firmly support the exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party group and demand a thorough investigation of their crimes. We will never allow these bad elements to destroy our new life.

　　Letter from Wang Aiqing of Shanghai Tongde Chengyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory: I am a cook, and I like to read literary books and newspapers, but I can't write articles. After reading the materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party group published in the "People's Daily," I felt great anger at Hu Feng's ugly behavior of deceiving the people. Therefore, I will say a few words to vent my anger.

　　From the exposed materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party group, I seem to see a red serpent hidden in the flowers and trees. After liberation, Hu Feng even more organized and planned to direct his group to attack the Party, sending his henchmen to infiltrate our state organs, "using Sun Wukong's tactic of drilling into the belly" to carry out reactionary activities. Look how vicious he is! Isn't he the public enemy of our working people? I demand that the relevant departments, in addition to dismissing him from all current positions, and ask the government to severely punish him according to the law!

　　Jointly signed letter from seventeen staff members of the Planning Department of the Coal Mine Geological Bureau: We fully support the resolution of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on May 25 to expel Hu Feng from the association and revoke all his positions in literary and art circles.

　　After reading the materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party group in the "People's Daily," we were extremely indignant. The Hu Feng group is the most insidious counter-revolutionary group that is organized and planned to disguise themselves as progressive and infiltrate the revolutionary ranks. Using his "cluster grenade" tactics, "Sun Wukong's tactic of drilling into the belly" to attack the revolutionary cause from inside and outside, opposing the Party, opposing the people, and opposing the revolution. The exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party group is a great victory for our people, which also proves that the great power of the people is irresistible.

　　As state workers and citizens, we firmly demand that Hu Feng's qualifications as a representative of the National People's Congress be revoked, and that the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng, who is guilty of heinous crimes, be punished according to law.

　　Letter from Xiao Xia of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Henan: We are coal miners, and we are constantly fighting against nature underground. All of this is for the early realization of socialist industrialization in the motherland, but Hu Feng and his accomplices want to sabotage our socialist construction. We workers deeply understand that today's victory and happiness are exchanged for the leadership of the Party and the blood of the martyrs. We respect the Party and will do our best to defend the Party, because this is to defend our own cause and defend our own happiness.

　　But Hu Feng hates our happy life and hates our large-scale economic and cultural construction. Therefore, he wants to revolutionize the working class, and he will never stop until he achieves his goal!

　　With unparalleled anger, we demand that Hu Feng answer:

　　Who are you working for? Who are you acting as a running dog for?

　　Manuscript from Wu Guoxiu, Huaibin County, Henan: I am a young farmer in Yingshui Village, Huaibin County, Henan Province. Now, not only is my life prosperous, and my class consciousness has improved, but I also have a preliminary understanding of some academic things.

　　The materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party group in the "People's Daily" cannot but make me angry! When I took up my pen to write this small manuscript, my hands were shaking with anger.

　　Hu Feng, vicious Hu Feng! Isn't your so-called "My Self-Criticism" just using it to continue to deceive the Party and the people, to cover up your hideous face? The awakened people will no longer allow you to wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and spread idealism; the awakened people will no longer allow you to insult them. You viciously exaggerate the backward side of the peasants, saying things like "the wounds of spiritual enslavement," and slander our workers and peasants, saying that they are "numb" in normal times and "crazy" when mobilized. Are we farmers like that? The history of the revolutionary struggle of the people of China and our participation in the revolutionary struggle led by the working class can prove it to us! The facts are very clear: the people are united in opposing imperialism, opposing feudal forces, and opposing bureaucrat-comprador capitalists, but you are opposing the people and opposing the revolution. The people are wholeheartedly building socialism, but you are opposing us. What else are you if you are not an enemy! It is not our workers and peasants who are "numb" or "crazy," but Hu Feng himself.

　　Hu Feng, vicious Hu Feng! No matter how many tricks you play, saying things like "revolutionary humanitarian spirit" or "benevolent heart," you can no longer deceive our workers and peasants. No matter what this smiling tiger says, such as "If it were not for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I personally would not have found a place to live in the past twenty years," and saying things like "I deeply feel that I have let down the people, let down the Party and the cause of the class, let down the great era," such flowery words can not whitewash your reactionary face. The materials exposed in the newspaper can prove that you are a complete bourgeois careerist and a complete reactionary.

　　Hu Feng, vicious Hu Feng! Didn't you speak loudly, saying something like "All things are prepared in me"? And what about "taking the world as one's own responsibility"? Isn't this kind of arrogant thinking that despises the people the thinking of a thoroughgoing careerist and reactionary?

　　Hu Feng, vicious Hu Feng! Don't try to deny it anymore, those letters were written by your own hand, you can't get away with it. We have the people and the national law, you can't escape!

　　Letter from Wang Xirong, instructor of the training class of the Liaoning Provincial Agricultural Production Cooperative: I am a cadre engaged in agricultural collectivization, and I want to express my views on Hu Feng and his group.

　　From the second batch of exposed materials, the "development work" carried out by Hu Feng using sneaky means of enticement cannot help but shock me. This counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng dared to establish his strongholds in our state organs, schools, publishing houses, and other cultural departments, and expand his power! What they are doing is nothing but to usurp the Party's leadership over the literary and art movement. Their despicable actions, in today's situation where imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang still exist, and where class struggle is fiercely underway, who (which class) their actions represent is conceivable.

　　Hu Feng painstakingly recruited people everywhere and established his "strongholds" everywhere, undoubtedly with huge political conspiracies. Abscesses must be cut off, and poisonous teeth must be pulled out, that's for sure. All of Hu Feng's followers who attempt to be lucky and deceive others will eventually be abandoned by the people like abscesses and poisonous teeth.

### 工农群众要求坚决打垮胡风集团

　　工农群众要求坚决打垮胡风集团
    石景山钢铁厂耿世杰、冯俊士来信：我们是石景山钢铁厂动力部的工人。我们以无比愤怒的心情，来声讨胡风这个反党反人民的极端阴险毒辣的家伙。
    胡风，我们过去是不熟悉他的，他写的文章我们也没有看过。但是现在我们却认识他了。他是一个反党反人民的阴谋家。二十年来他一直在欺骗着人民，冒称革命的进步作家，今天被人民揭露了。
    他仇恨党、仇恨人民、仇恨革命已经达到了疯狂的程度，他咒骂和污蔑我们伟大的中国共产党，他的所谓“革命”又是“磨我的剑，窥测方向”“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”来进行反革命的活动。当他向党进攻失败以后，却又向他的集团分子布置退却策略，企图继续用两面派的手段，来保存他们的“实力”，待机再起。
    胡风，你的阴谋，是决不会实现的！我们的党坚如磐石，我们的眼睛雪亮，我们工人阶级的队伍是坚固的，任何反动势力，都必定要死亡！
    江西省新喻车站方云鹏来信：我是个铁路工人。近几天来党报揭露了胡风反党集团的阴谋，我感到是正确也是必要的。为了保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫劳动人民的胜利果实，我们一定要揭露那些戴着假脸的暗藏敌人，把他们肃清。我衷心拥护对胡风集团的揭露，并要求把这个反革命集团彻底打垮。
    锦西化工厂邓世华来信：从“人民日报”发表的关于胡风反党集团的两批材料中，完全可以看出胡风和他的反党集团二十多年来，一直是站在反革命的立场上和党、和人民敌对的。他的反党集团的各种卑鄙的阴谋活动，和美蒋特务的活动的性质是一样的。因此应该严厉惩办他！
    我在一个化学工厂的车间里工作。我国工人阶级、劳动人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，为建设社会主义辛勤地劳动着。我们决不允许蒋介石反动政权复辟，而胡风却要等待“时机”的到来。这说明他直到写那篇假的“我的自我批判”时，仍然仇恨革命。胡风，你要等待的“时机”是绝不会来的，死心吧！
    沈阳国营东北制药总厂蔡照才来信：我是一个制药工人。我虽然文化程度不高，但从报纸所揭露的关于胡风集团的材料中也能看得出，胡风是个极为恶劣的反革命分子，是形形色色的敌人中最阴险的暗害者。我衷心地拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议对胡风的处理，并建议有关部门依法给以惩办。
    杭州市下城区刻字业学习小组组长张耿书来信：从胡风给他集团中的分子的那些密信中，能够明显地看出胡风如何用卑鄙的手段去“联络人”“争取人”来扩充“实力”，进行着反党反人民反革命的活动。他那种鬼鬼祟祟的阴谋活动和美蒋特务的手段有什么区别呢？我坚决拥护对胡风反党集团的揭露，并要求彻底追查他们的罪行。我们决不允许这些坏分子破坏我们的新生活。
    上海同德成记染织厂王爱卿来信：我是个炊事员，爱看文艺书报，但不会写稿。看了“人民日报”发表的揭露胡风反党集团的材料以后，对胡风欺骗人民的丑恶行为感到很大愤恨。因此，我讲两句话，吐出我的心头怒火。
    从揭露出来的关于胡风反党集团的材料里，我彷佛看见了一条隐在花木丛中的赤练蛇。在解放后，胡风更有组织、有计划地指挥着他的集团向党进攻，派遣他的党羽混到我们国家机关里来，“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，来进行反动活动。你看，他有多么狠毒！他不是我们劳动人民的公敌还是什么！我要求有关部门除了撤销他现在所有的职务外，并要求政府依据法律严办他！
    煤矿地质局计划处工作人员十七人联合签名来信：我们完全拥护五月二十五日中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议决议，开除胡风会籍，并撤销他在文艺界一切职务。
    在读了“人民日报”上揭露胡风反党集团的材料后，我们极为愤慨，胡风集团是有组织有计划地伪装进步混进革命阵营的最阴险的反革命集团。用他的“集束手榴弹”的战法，“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”里外夹攻地破坏革命事业，反对党，反对人民，反对革命。胡风反党集团的被揭发是我们人民的大胜利，这也证明人民伟大的力量，是不可抗拒的。
    我们以国家工作人员、公民的身份，坚决要求撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会的代表资格，并依法惩处反革命集团罪大恶极的反革命分子胡风。
    河南焦作煤矿笑侠来信：我们是煤矿工作者，我们成天在地下和自然作斗争，这一切都是为了祖国早日实现社会主义工业化，但胡风和他的同党呢，却是要破坏我们的社会主义建设事业。我们工人阶级深深的懂得，今天的胜利和幸福，是党的领导和先烈们的鲜血换来的。我们敬爱党，而且要全力保卫党，因为这就是保卫我们自己的事业，保卫我们自己的幸福。
    可是胡风痛恨我们幸福的生活，痛恨我们大规模地进行经济和文化建设。因此他要革工人阶级的命，而且不达到目的还誓不罢休！
    我们以无比的愤怒要求胡风回答：
    你是在替谁卖力？替谁当走狗？
    河南淮滨县吴国修来稿：我是河南省淮滨县迎水村的青年农民，现在不但生活富裕了，阶级觉悟提高了，而且也初步地了解了些学术性的东西。
  “人民日报”揭发的胡风反党集团的材料，不能不使我发火！当我执笔写这篇小稿的时候，火得两只手一直在发抖。
    胡风，恶毒的胡风！你的所谓“我的自我批判”，还不是利用它来对党对人民继续进行欺骗，以掩盖你的狰狞面孔吗？觉悟了的人民，再也不容许你披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，散布唯心主义了；觉悟了的人民，再也不容许你侮辱了。你恶毒地夸大农民落后的一面，说什么“精神奴役的创伤”，又诬蔑我们工农群众，平时是“麻木”，发动起来又是“疯狂”。难道我们农民是这样的吗？全中国人民和我们参加工人阶级所领导的革命斗争的历史可以给我们作证！事实很清楚，人民在同心同德地反对帝国主义，反对封建势力，反对官僚大资本家，你却在反对人民，反对革命。人民在一心
  一意地建设社会主义，你却在反对我们。你不是敌人是什么！“麻木”、“疯狂”的不是我们工农群众，而是胡风自己。
    胡风，恶毒的胡风！不怕你玩多少花样，说什么“革命的人道主义精神”，什么“仁爱的胸怀”，再也欺哄不了我们工农群众了。不怕你这笑面虎说什么“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的”，又说什么“我沉痛地感到辜负了人民，辜负了党和阶级事业，辜负了伟大的时代”等等花言巧语，也粉饰不了你的反动面孔。报纸揭发出来的材料，可以证实你是个十足的资产阶级野心家，十足的反动家伙。
    胡风，恶毒的胡风！你不是大言大语地说什么
  “万物皆备于我”么？又是什么“以天下为己任”么？你这种蔑视人民的狂妄思想，不是彻头彻尾的野心家、反动分子的思想是什么？
    胡风，恶毒的胡风！不容你再抵赖，那些信是你自己亲手写的，你想蒙混是混不过去的。我们有人民和国法在，你逃也逃不掉的！
    辽宁省农业生产合作社训练班教导科辅导员王锡荣来信：我是一个从事农业合作化工作的干部，我要发表我对胡风及其集团的看法。
    从第二批揭发的材料看，胡风用鬼鬼祟祟的拉拢手段所进行的“开辟工作”，不禁使我大吃
  一惊。胡风这个反革命分子竟胆敢在我们的国家机关、学校、出版社以及其他文化部门里建立他的据点，扩张他的势力！他们所干的勾当不是别的，正是要篡夺党对文艺运动的领导权。他们的卑鄙行径，在今天帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮仍然存在的情况下，在阶级斗争激烈进行的情况下，他们的行动代表了谁（哪个阶级），是可想而知的。
    胡风处心积虑地到处网罗人，到处建立他的
  “据点”，无疑地是有着巨大的政治阴谋的。脓疮要割掉，毒牙要拔掉，这是定了的。一切企图侥幸，混瞒过关的胡风的追随者，最后都要像脓疮和毒牙一样被人民所抛掉。
