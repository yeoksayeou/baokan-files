Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 30th. The Fourth National Posts and Telecommunications Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications was held in Beijing from May 23rd to 30th. The conference reviewed and summarized the postal and telecommunications work of 1954 and determined and deployed the main tasks for 1955. In 1954, the national postal and telecommunications industry achieved further development. Compared with 1953, the number of postal routes increased by 5.1 percent, long-distance telecommunication lines increased by 3.7 percent, postal and telecommunications service institutions increased by 23.9 percent, and urban telephone equipment increased by 14 percent. In 1954, the postal and telecommunications departments also overfulfilled the state financial remittance plan and rectified the private merchant components of postal agencies. Newspaper and magazine distribution, services for industrial and mining enterprises, and rural postal services have also been improved.
    The conference focused on criticizing the main shortcomings of past postal and telecommunications work, pointing out that postal and telecommunications departments in various regions have not yet clearly and systematically grasped the key issues in enterprise management; most postal and telecommunications enterprises lack unified standards and basis in organizational structure and business management, resulting in unreasonable organizational structures, large management departments, overstaffing, unclear responsibilities, and unclear division of labor, leading to work chaos and tendencies toward bureaucracy, red tape, and preoccupation with routine matters in work. At the same time, the planning work of the postal and telecommunications departments cannot meet the needs of enterprise management; there are many statistical reports, but they cannot accurately and timely reflect economic activities; basic construction lacks the principles and standards of postal and telecommunications construction, and the long-term plan for the communication network has not yet been formulated; cadre management and training cannot meet the requirements of enterprise development; and the production and financial plan and basic construction plan for 1954 were not completed well enough.
    Based on the State Council's streamlining policy and the current situation of postal and telecommunications enterprises, the conference determined that the main tasks of postal and telecommunications work in 1955 are to ensure the successful completion of communication tasks and the state plan; to implement the State Council's streamlining policy, comprehensively rectify the postal and telecommunications organizational structure, determine personnel staffing standards, and establish and improve business management systems. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen postal and telecommunications service work, improve the quality of postal and telecommunications work; and improve basic construction, rural postal work, and cadre management and training. According to the preliminary estimates of the conference, after the reorganization of postal and telecommunications bureaus across the country, administrative management personnel alone can save more than 8,000 people, accounting for about 50 percent of the number of people reorganized. The personnel saved will be used to replenish production departments, add postal and telecommunications service institutions, and expand the scope of service work, in order to increase enterprise revenue and reduce production costs.

　　邮电部召开第四次全国邮电工作会议
    新华社三十日讯　邮电部召开的第四次全国邮电工作会议五月二十三日到三十日在北京举行。这次会议检查和总结了一九五四年的邮电工作，确定和部署了一九五五年的主要工作。一九五四年内，全国邮电事业获得了进一步发展。和一九五三年相比，邮路增加了百分之五点一，长途电信线路增加百分之三点七，邮电服务机构增加百分之二十三点九，市内电话设备增加百分之十四。一九五四年邮电部门还超额完成了国家财务上缴计划，整顿了私商成份的邮政代办所。报刊发行、为工矿服务和乡村邮政等工作也有了改进。
    会议着重批判了过去邮电工作的主要缺点，指出各地邮电部门还没有明确地、系统地抓紧解决企业管理上的关键问题；邮电企业在组织机构和业务管理上大多缺乏统一的标准和依据，因而组织机构不合理，管理部门庞大，人浮于事，职责不明，分工不清，造成工作混乱，产生了工作中的官僚主义、文牍主义和事务主义的倾向。同时，邮电部门的计划工作也不能适应企业管理的需要，统计表报很多，但不能准确及时地反映经济活动状况；基本建设方面缺乏邮电建设的原则和标准，通信网路的长远规划还没有制定出来；干部管理和培养训练不能适应企业发展的要求；一九五四年的生产财务计划和基本建设计划完成得都不够好。
    会议根据国务院的整编方针和邮电企业的现状，确定一九五五年的邮电工作主要是保证良好地完成通信任务和国家计划；贯彻国务院整编的方针，全面地整顿邮电组织机构，确定人员编制标准，建立和健全业务管理制度。同时，要加强邮电服务工作，提高邮电工作质量；改进基本建设、乡村邮电工作以及干部管理和培养教育等工作。据会议的初步估计，全国邮电局整编后，只是行政管理人员就可节省出八千多人，占整编人数的百分之五十左右。节省出来的人员将充实生产部门，增设邮电服务机构，扩大服务工作范围，以便增加企业的收入，降低生产成本。
