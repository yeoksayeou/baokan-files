Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. Heads of the Chinese Artists Association, Jiang Feng, Liu Kaiqu, Ye Qianyu, Wu Zuoren, Cai Ruohong, Wang Chaowen, Hua Junwu, Shao Yu, Gu Yuan, Yan Han, Hu Man, Li Qun, and others wrote to the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles on the 23rd, suggesting that Hu Feng be purged from the literary and art ranks. The full text is as follows:

    After reading the materials exposed by Shu Wu in the May 13th "People's Daily," it very clearly illustrates Hu Feng's true anti-Party and anti-people nature, illustrates Hu Feng's insidious and vicious double-dealing tactics, and illustrates a conspirator who has been lurking in the revolutionary literary and art ranks for many years, consistently and organizationally carrying out counter-revolutionary activities; Hu Feng's secret letters to Shu Wu are his own most truthful confession explaining all of this.

    We completely agree with the "People's Daily" editor's note that what is false is false, disguises should be stripped away, and concealment cannot last. Our literary and art circles should thoroughly clarify the entire situation of Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique, and now the time has come when it can be clarified.

    The matter is very clear: Hu Feng's consistent counter-revolutionary activities are by no means a matter of ideology, but a serious political issue. Therefore, we suggest that the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers Association immediately remove Hu Feng from all the positions he holds and purge such an extremely ugly and utterly despicable character from our literary and art circles!

　　中国美术家协会负责人写信给中国文学艺术界联合会
　　建议把胡风从文艺界队伍中清洗出去
    新华社二十三日讯　中国美术家协会负责人江丰、刘开渠、叶浅予、吴作人、蔡若虹、王朝闻、华君武、邵宇、古元、彦涵、胡蛮、力群等在二十三日写信给中国文学艺术界联合会，建议把胡风从文艺界队伍中清洗出去。全文如下：
    读五月十三日“人民日报”上舒芜所揭露的材料，非常清楚地说明了胡风反党反人民的真面目，说明了胡风阴险毒辣的两面派的手段，说明了一个多年混在革命文艺队伍中一贯有组织地进行反革命活动的阴谋家；胡风写给舒芜的密信，就是他自己说明这一切的最真实的供状。
    我们完全同意“人民日报”的编者按语，假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去，隐瞒是不能持久的。我们文艺界应当彻底弄清胡风及其反党集团的全部情况，而现在已经到了可以弄清的时候了。
    事情非常明白，胡风的一贯反革命活动，决不是什么思想问题，而是一个严重的政治问题。因此，我们建议中国文联和中国作家协会立即撤销胡风所担任的一切职务，把这样一个无比丑恶和十分卑鄙的脚色从我们的文艺界清洗出去！
