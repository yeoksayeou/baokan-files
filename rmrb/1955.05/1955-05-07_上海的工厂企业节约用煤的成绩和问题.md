　　Shanghai's Factories and Enterprises Achieve Success in Saving Coal, but Problems Remain
　　Li Junfeng
    Shanghai's factories consume a large amount of fuel. However, Shanghai is far from coal-producing areas, and even the closest Huainan coal mine is two days away. Therefore, saving fuel is of great economic value to Shanghai's industry. Starting from September of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Company of China Coal Industry Building Materials Corporation began to focus on saving coal in 278 factories in Shanghai that require more than 100 tons of coal per month. By the end of December, several hundred factories in the city, needing between 10 and 100 tons of coal per month, had paid attention to saving coal to varying degrees. By the end of March of this year, according to preliminary statistics, more than 93,000 tons of coal have been saved for the country.
    However, many facts show that the waste of industrial coal in Shanghai is still quite serious, and there is still great potential for savings. Take cigarette factories as an example. The state-owned Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 4 has reduced the unit coal consumption per case of cigarettes from 16.7 kg in the past to 6.8 kg. Since April, the average coal consumption per case of cigarettes has further dropped to 5.2 kg. However, most cigarette factories now consume about 9 to 10 kg. Another example is the State-owned Cotton Mill No. 16, which has the lowest coal consumption, using about 2 kg of coal per bolt of cloth. However, some individual factories still consume as much as 5 kg. In the dyeing and printing industry, which consumes a large amount of coal, the joint state-private owned Hengfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory has reduced coal consumption to 8.39 kg per bolt of cloth, while some dyeing and printing factories consume more than 10 kg of coal per bolt of cloth. From this, it can be seen that Shanghai's industrial enterprises need to further develop their work in saving coal.
    At present, a relatively serious problem is that many leaders of factories and enterprises and some management departments emphasize their central tasks and claim to be busy, regarding the work of saving coal as an extra burden. They have relaxed their leadership over the work of saving coal. This phenomenon is particularly common in some factories that are directly allocated coal by the central government. Currently, among more than 40 factories and enterprises, there are only seven or eight that have achieved significant results in leaders paying attention to saving coal. Among the enterprises that do not pay attention to saving coal, the four factories under the Shanghai Paper Industry Company are the most serious. In the first quarter of this year, three of the four factories exceeded the planned quota for coal consumption. However, the personnel responsible for leading this work in the paper industry department are indifferent to this, rarely inspect the coal consumption of their affiliated factories, and adopt a perfunctory attitude when relevant departments go to understand the situation. The joint state-private owned Yangzi Timber Factory has leaking boiler tubes everywhere, and the returning steam is not utilized, causing steam to permeate the workshop, affecting production and safety.
    Saving coal and completing production tasks are not conflicting. If the work is carried out well, it will also help improve production work. For example, the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory used to have an insufficient steam supply from the boiler room, which often affected output. After launching the saving coal effort, the boiler room workers created the "three-person cross-assistance coal feeding method," and the administrative side established a system. Steam can now fully meet the needs of production. Another example is the private Zhonghe Yiji Glass Factory, which used to use an average of four tons of coal per day, resulting in significant waste. The products processed for the state were often returned due to poor quality. After launching the saving coal effort, coal consumption gradually decreased to about 2.5 tons per day, the number of products increased by about 8 percent, and the phenomenon of returns also decreased significantly.
    Some enterprise leaders mistakenly regard saving coal as a trivial "small matter." In fact, saving fuel has extremely significant economic implications. Shanghai saved more than 93,000 tons of coal by March of this year, saving the country more than 3.25 million yuan. It can supply thermal power plants to generate more than 167 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and can weave more than 13 million bolts of cloth.
    Some enterprises also use the excuse that the boiler equipment is old and waste is unavoidable, but this statement is also incorrect. In fact, it is still possible to save fuel even with old boiler equipment. The State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory is an example. The boiler equipment in this factory was installed more than 30 years ago, and coal consumption often exceeded the plan in the past. Starting from October of last year, the leadership of this factory launched a mass inspection campaign, promptly plugging 18 air leaks and heat escapes in places such as the furnace wall flues and economizers. The boiler room also unified the operation of the stokers, adopting a method of rationally mixing and burning highly volatile coal and durable coal in a certain proportion. The workshop workers also reversed the incorrect idea that the more steam used, the better the product quality, and initially overcame the waste of steam. The average daily consumption in the second half of the month decreased by 20.61 tons compared with the first half of the month, and the daily consumption in November decreased by 13 tons compared with October. The coal saved in one and a half months was equivalent to about 20 percent of the factory's monthly coal consumption, exceeding the target for saving coal.
    Currently, another common shortcoming in Shanghai's industrial coal saving work is that the mobilization of the masses is not deep or broad enough. Most factories are still limited to one department, the boiler room, and therefore the results are not significant. The joint state-private owned Hengfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory recently promoted the saving coal work from the boiler room to the workshop and to the entire factory, and achieved good results. This factory originally had three boilers, and the steam supply was often insufficient, affecting production. In March, they mobilized workshop workers and technicians to jointly overcome the waste of steam, and as a result, solved the problem of insufficient steam supply that the factory had failed to solve for decades. Sometimes they could even stop burning one boiler and continue production as usual. In March, the average coal consumption per bolt of cloth decreased by 6.19 kg compared with the fourth quarter of last year, saving a large amount of coal. Due to the improved boiler efficiency and the increased car speed in the workshop due to the sufficient steam supply, a certain amount of water and electricity was also saved.

### 上海的工厂企业节约用煤的成绩和问题

　　上海的工厂企业节约用煤的成绩和问题
　　李峻峰
    上海全市工厂的燃料消耗量很大。但是上海离开产煤区很远，离开最近的淮南煤矿也有两天的路程。因此，节约燃料对上海工业来说是有很大经济价值的。从去年九月份起，中国煤业建筑器材公司上海市公司开始在每月需煤一百吨以上的上海二百七十八家工厂中重点试行节约用煤。到十二月底，全市月需煤百吨以下、十吨以上的八百几十家工厂，在不同的程度上注意了节约用煤。到今年三月底止，据初步统计，已为国家节约了九万三千多吨煤炭。
    但是许多事实说明，上海的工业用煤浪费情况仍然是相当严重的，可以节约的潜力还很大。拿烟厂来说，国营上海烟草四厂每箱烟的单位耗煤量已由过去的十六点七公斤降低到六点八公斤，四月份以来，每箱烟平均耗煤量又下降到五点二公斤，但一般烟厂现在大多是九至十公斤左右。又如耗煤量最低的国棉十六厂，一匹布用煤二公斤左右，但个别厂现在还有高到五公斤的。另如在用煤量较大的印染业中，公私合营恒丰染织厂每一匹布的耗煤量目前已降到八点三九公斤，而有些印染工厂每匹布的耗煤量都在十公斤以上。由此可见，上海工业企业的节约用煤工作需要进一步开展。
    目前比较严重的问题是：不少工厂企业的领导人员和部分管理部门，强调中心任务多，工作忙，把节约用煤工作看成额外负担，放松了对节约用煤工作的领导，这种现象，尤其是在中央直接配煤的一些工厂中更是普遍存在。目前在四十多个工厂企业中，领导重视节约用煤有显著成绩的，还不过七、八家。在不注意节约用煤的企业中，以上海造纸工业公司所属的四个工厂最严重。今年第一季度，四个工厂就有三个工厂超过了用煤的计划定额，但造纸工业部门负责领导这一工作的人员，却对此漠不关心，对所属各厂用煤情况很少检查，逢到有关部门前去了解情况，就采取敷衍应付的态度。公私合营扬子木材厂，锅炉管子到处漏汽，回汽不加利用，车间内弄得蒸汽弥漫，影响生产和安全。
    节约用煤工作和完成生产任务是并不冲突的。工作进行得好，还会有助于生产工作的改进。例如国营上海第二印染厂，过去炉子间供给蒸汽不足，常常影响产量，开展节约用煤后，炉子间工人创造了
  “三人交叉互助投煤法”，行政方面建立了制度，蒸汽已完全能满足生产的需要。又如私营中和义记玻璃厂，过去平均每天要用四吨煤，浪费很大，替国家加工的产品也常因质量低劣而退货。开展节约用煤后，用煤量逐步下降至每天二吨半左右，产品数量增加百分之八左右，同时，退货的现象也显著减少了。
    有些企业领导人错误地把节约用煤视为鸡毛蒜皮的“小事情”。实际上节约燃料是有极大的经济意义的。上海市到今年三月为止，节约了九万三千多吨煤炭，共为国家节省了三百二十五万多元。它可以供火力发电厂发一亿六千七百多万度电，可以织布一千三百多万匹。
    也有些企业借口锅炉设备陈旧，浪费无法避免，这种说法也是不对的。实际上锅炉设备旧仍然有可能节约燃料的，国营上海第一印染厂就是一个例子。这个厂的锅炉设备安装已有三十多年，过去用煤经常超过计划。从去年十月份起，这个厂的领导方面发动了群众性的检查运动，及时地把炉墙烟道和节煤器等十八处漏风逃热的地方堵塞住，炉子间也统一了司炉操作，在使用燃煤上采用挥发性高的煤和耐烧的煤按一定比例合理搭配拼烧的办法。车间工人也扭转了用汽愈多产品质量愈好的不正确思想，初步克服了用汽的浪费，当月下半月的平均日耗量就较上半月减少了二十点六一吨，十一月日耗量又较十月减少十三吨，一个半月节约的煤炭，相当于该厂月用煤量的百分之二十左右，超额完成了节约用煤指标。
    目前上海节约工业用煤工作中，另一个普遍缺点是发动群众还不深不广，大多数工厂还只是限于炉子间一个部门，因而收效不大。公私合营恒丰染织厂，最近把节约用煤工作从炉子间推向车间，推向全厂，收到了很好的效果。这个厂原有锅炉三只，经常供汽不足，影响生产。三月份他们发动车间工人和技术人员共同克服用汽的浪费，结果解决了这个厂几十年来未能解决的供汽不足问题，有时还可以停烧一只炉子而照常生产。三月份每匹布平均用煤较去年第四季度降低了六点一九公斤，节约了大量的煤炭。由于锅炉效率提高和车间因供汽足增加了车速，同时也节约了一定数量的水电。
