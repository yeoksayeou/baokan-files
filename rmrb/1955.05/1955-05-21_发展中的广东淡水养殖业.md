Developing Freshwater Aquaculture in Guangdong
　　Wu Erxiang
    Guangdong Province has a mild climate and abundant rainfall, suitable for the breeding of freshwater fish, and is one of the key areas for artificial freshwater aquaculture in China. According to incomplete statistics, the province has utilized approximately 1.2 million mu of freshwater aquaculture area. In 1954, the total output of pond fish in the province reached 2.45 million dan, with a value of more than 68 million yuan. The central Guangdong area has superior natural conditions. Bighead carp can produce three crops a year. Other species such as bream, grass carp, dace, and carp can generally be harvested after being stocked for nine to ten months. The annual output of pond fish accounts for more than 80 percent of the total pond fish production in the province, making it the main producing area of pond fish in Guangdong Province. At the same time, this area is also a famous fish fry producing area in the country. The area along the West River produces more than 2 billion fish fry annually, accounting for more than 90 percent of the province's fish fry production. This area has a long history of fish farming, and more than 700,000 farmers rely on fish farming as their main source of livelihood.
    Before liberation, pond fish production in Guangdong Province was greatly damaged. At the time of liberation, the annual output of pond fish in the province was only about 1 million dan. After liberation, through land reform, national loans to help, and state-owned trade departments expanding the sales of pond fish and stabilizing pond fish prices, pond fish production gradually recovered and developed. By 1951, the total output of pond fish in the province had increased to 1.7 million dan, and in 1954 it further increased to 2.45 million dan. Fish fry production also recovered rapidly. In 1951, the total output of fish fry in the province was only 1.2 billion, but by 1954 it had increased to 2.6 billion, exceeding the highest pre-war production level. The year-by-year increase in pond fish production has guaranteed the growing demand of urban and rural people. Taking Guangzhou City as an example: in 1952, the quantity of pond fish supplied was 340,000 dan, in 1953 it increased to 410,000 dan, and in 1954 it further increased to about 500,000 dan. The average per capita consumption in the city reached 33 jin per year. At the same time, more than 40 million jin of pond fish are exported every year, earning a lot of foreign exchange for the country.
      Freshwater fish farming is a relatively meticulous task, requiring more technology and experience than agricultural production, and also requires more investment. For example, pond fish production requires dedicated management, requiring rational stocking of various fish species according to the different conditions of each fish pond, such as size, depth, soil quality, fertility, and sunlight, using the living characteristics of various fish species to make them interdependent and grow, and increase the growth rate. Because the stocked fish have their own characteristics, too much or too little stocking is not conducive to production. At the same time, the environmental sanitation and feeding management of fish ponds are closely related to pond fish production. However, due to the lack of funds, labor, and experience of individual farmers, pond fish production has been greatly limited. Although production has increased year by year in recent years, the unit yield is still very low. Taking Shunde County, the main pond fish producing area in Guangdong, as an example, the fish pond area accounts for 40 percent of the county's cultivated land area, and the average yield per mu in 1954 was only 316 jin. If we take the entire central Guangdong area, the average yield per mu of fish pond is only 285 jin.
    After the autumn of 1953, a large number of fish farming farmers joined agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid groups. Now, in economic crop areas or semi-economic crop areas that mainly engage in fish farming, 158 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 8,200 mutual aid groups have been established. After being organized, mutual aid groups generally increase production by 20 to 40 percent compared with individual households, and agricultural production cooperatives increase production by 10 to 15 percent compared with mutual aid groups. After Lin Yuliang of Dongqu Township, Zhongshan County, joined the agricultural production cooperative, his fish pond was used reasonably, and the yield per mu of fish was more than 1,000 jin, an increase of eight times compared with before joining the cooperative. The reason why agricultural production cooperatives can achieve significant increases in production is that: fish ponds are managed in a unified way, funds are used in a concentrated way, labor is allocated in a unified way, with dedicated personnel and responsibilities, strengthening feeding management, and ensuring planned production increases.
    The mutual aid and cooperation movement has opened up broad prospects for freshwater aquaculture in Guangdong. The pond fish production of agricultural production cooperatives has proved that the unit yield per mu of fish pond can be increased to more than 1,000 jin. At the same time, due to superior natural conditions, it is estimated that at least 2 million mu of area in the province can be used for aquaculture. These are all favorable conditions for Guangdong to develop freshwater aquaculture. According to the national plan, this year's freshwater fish production in Guangdong is required to increase by 13.3 percent on the basis of 1954, and this task can be strived to be overfulfilled. However, at present, some leading staff members do not pay enough attention to the development of freshwater aquaculture, there is no fundamental cure for grass carp diseases, the price of fish fry is still subject to the free market; the survival rate of fish fry is low; fish feed has not been well resolved; pond fish are concentrated for sale in the last few months of the year, forming a phenomenon of pond fish crowding and stockpiling at the end of each year, and a shortage of supply in April and May. These problems remain to be solved.

　　发展中的广东淡水养殖业
　　吴尔祥
    广东省气候温和，雨水充足，适宜于淡水鱼类的生育，是我国人工淡水养殖重点地区之一。据不完全统计，全省已利用的淡水养殖面积约一百二十万亩。一九五四年全省塘鱼总产量达二百四十五万担，价值六千八百多万元。粤中区自然条件优越，大头鳙一年可产三造，其他如鳊、鲩、鲮、鲤等一般放养九至十个月便可登场，年产塘鱼占全省塘鱼总产量百分之八十以上，为广东省塘鱼主要产地。同时这个地区又是全国著名的鱼苗产地，西江沿江地带年产鱼苗二十余亿尾，占全省鱼苗生产的百分之九十以上。这个地区已有悠久的养鱼历史，农民靠养鱼为生活主要来源的有七十多万人。
    解放前，广东省的塘鱼生产受到很大的破坏，临解放时，全省塘鱼年产量只有一百万市担左右。解放后，经过土地改革，国家贷款帮助和国营贸易部门扩大塘鱼销路，稳定塘鱼价格，塘鱼生产逐渐得到恢复、发展，到一九五一年全省塘鱼总产量已提高到一百七十万担，一九五四年又提高到二百四十五万担。鱼苗生产也迅速恢复，一九五一年全省鱼苗总产量只有十二亿尾，到一九五四年已提高到二十六亿尾，超过战前的最高生产水平。塘鱼的逐年增产，保证了对城乡人民日益增长的需求。以广州市为例：一九五二年供应塘鱼数量为三十四万担，一九五三年提高到四十一万担，到一九五四年又提高到五十万担左右，全市人民平均每人一年消费量达三十三斤。同时每年并有四千多万斤塘鱼出口，为国家换回了不少外汇。
      淡水鱼类养殖工作是一项比较细致的工作，比农业生产更需要技术和经验，投资也较大。如塘鱼生产要求专人管理，要求根据每个鱼塘的大小、深浅、土质肥瘦、阳光充足与否等不同情况，合理地放养各种鱼类，利用各种鱼类的生活特点，使其相互依存生长，提高成长率。由于放养的鱼类各有各的特点，多放或少放都不利于生产。同时鱼塘的环境卫生和饲养管理工作，对塘鱼生产都有密切的关系。但是由于个体农民资金不足，劳动力不足，经验缺乏，因此，塘鱼生产受到了很大的限制。这几年来虽然年年增产，但单位产量仍然很低，以广东塘鱼主要产区顺德县来说，鱼塘面积占了全县耕地面积百分之四十，一九五四年每亩平均产量只有三百十六斤，如以全粤中区来说，每亩鱼塘平均产量只二百八十五斤。
    一九五三年秋后大批养鱼的农民参加了农业生产合作社或互助组。现在以养鱼为主的经济作物区或半经济作物区已成立农业生产合作社一百五十八个、互助组八千二百多个。组织起来后，互助组一般都比单干户增产百分之二十到百分之四十，农业生产合作社又比互助组增产百分之十到百分之十五。中山县东区乡林宇良参加农业生产合作社后，他的鱼塘因得到合理使用，每亩产鱼一千斤以上，比入社前增产八倍。农业生产合作社所以能获得显著增产的原因是：鱼塘统一经营，资金集中使用，劳动力统一调拨，专职专责，加强了饲养管理工作，保证了有计划的增产。
    互助合作运动已经为广东的淡水养殖事业开辟了广阔的前途。农业生产合作社的塘鱼生产已证明每亩鱼塘的单位产量可以提高到一千斤以上，同时，由于自然条件优越，据估计全省可以利用养殖的面积至少还有两百万亩。这些都是广东发展淡水养殖事业的有利条件。根据国家计划，今年广东淡水鱼类的产量要求在一九五四年的基础上增加百分之十三点三，这个任务是可以争取超额完成的。但是目前有些领导工作人员对于发展淡水养殖事业还不够重视，对鲩鱼病还没有根本的治疗办法，鱼苗的价格还受自由市场的支配；鱼苗成活率低；养鱼饲料还未很好解决；塘鱼集中在年底几个月内出售，形成每年年底塘鱼挤销积压，到四、五月间又感到供应不足的现象。这些问题还有待解决。
