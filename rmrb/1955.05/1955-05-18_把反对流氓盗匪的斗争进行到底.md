    Since January of this year, public security, judicial, and procuratorial organs in Dalian, Tianjin, Chongqing, and other places have accepted accusations from the people, successively arresting many criminals who committed crimes of assault and robbery, theft, fraud, rape of women, and disturbance of social order, and sentenced them to death or imprisonment according to the severity of their crimes. These positive measures taken by state organs to strictly enforce revolutionary law and protect the interests of the people have not only further guaranteed the country's construction endeavors but have also further united the people and consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship.

    However, some state organ staff members have consistently failed to adequately recognize the serious significance of this struggle. For example, after the Jiangxi Provincial Public Security organs received the task from higher authorities to actively combat thugs and bandits, they failed to organize the necessary forces to lead this work. In the past year, half of the criminal cases involving homicide, arson, and poisoning that occurred in Jiangxi Province have not been solved. Some important cases have not even been assigned for investigation and solving. This serious state of paralysis and irresponsibility has directly fueled the arrogance of thugs and bandits, leaving the safety of the state and the people's lives and property without due protection.

    The Shanghai Public Security organs have paid attention to cracking major cases and have achieved considerable success. However, some public security sub-bureaus seem to look down on minor cases. For some minor cases, they only register them without seriously arranging for investigation and solving, which allows counter-revolutionaries and thugs and bandits to continue their destructive activities by adopting "guerrilla" tactics.

    Some public security organs in some areas only pick up small cases that are easy to solve, but for those complex and serious cases, they often fail to take effective measures based on the actual situation, resulting in a very low rate of solving cases. This is a more common phenomenon in rural areas and some small cities. Hebei Province is a region with a relatively high case-solving rate, but there are also some major cases that no one cares about. For example, the case of Wu Xizhong, a Communist Party member in Xing'an Township, Gaocheng County, who was assassinated, has not been actively investigated by the county's public security organs.

    Laxity in the struggle against thugs and bandits is very wrong and should be corrected.

    Many criminal cases solved in Dalian, Tianjin, and other places prove that the criminal activities of thugs and bandits are often closely linked with the sabotage activities of escaped counter-revolutionaries, landlords, rich peasants, and illegal capitalist elements. For example, the Liu Wanzhong bandit gang cracked down on in Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, was headed by the escaped counter-revolutionary Liu Wanzhong and colluded with landlord and rich peasant elements, habitual thieves, hooligans, and illegal capitalists. Over the years, they have frequently robbed and stolen state and people's property, murdered revolutionary cadres and active members of the masses, and raped women. The major thief Wang Huide, captured in Dalian, was a serious lawbreaker in the "Five-Anti" movement. After the "Five-Anti" movement, Wang colluded with hooligans and habitual thieves in order to continue sabotaging the country's economic construction and used various despicable means to corrupt and deceive dozens of teenagers and backward peasants, stealing a large amount of state property. More than two hundred kinds of valuable machinery and equipment from state-owned enterprises alone were stolen by them. The so-called "Ten Brothers" and "Thirty-Six Gangs" of thugs and bandits cracked down on in Shanghai were also formed by escaped counter-revolutionaries and illegal capitalist elements in conjunction with hooligans. It is quite obvious that today's activities of thugs and bandits have a clear political nature.

    Based on this situation, public security, judicial, and procuratorial organs, as well as party and government leading organs in various localities, must be determined to carry the struggle against thugs and bandits through to the end and strive for a complete victory. From the perspective of party and government leading organs, leading production is a top priority, but if we fail to simultaneously pay attention to eliminating thugs and bandits, the fruits of production will not be guaranteed. It must be recognized that the work of socialist construction and socialist transformation, the work of unified purchase and sales, and commodity distribution and transportation are all very important. However, without good social order, these tasks will all suffer unexpected damage. Therefore, we should not arbitrarily abandon or relax this aspect of the struggle, nor can we tolerate the bias of only solving major cases and not solving minor cases, or only solving simple cases and not solving complex cases. It is also completely wrong for the public security, judicial, and procuratorial organs in some places to mechanically separate the crackdown on thugs and bandits from the crackdown on hidden political enemies. In fact, cracking down on thugs and bandits will further isolate hidden spies and secret agents, and may even directly expose spies and secret agents. Because thugs and bandits are often the social basis for the activities of spies and agents, all criminal activities provide direct support and assistance to counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, and the enemies in these two areas have gradually merged and are difficult to separate completely. Everyone should understand that cracking down on spies and agents and thugs and bandits are long-term struggle tasks, and therefore must be carried out in combination.

    Cracking down on thugs and bandits and other criminals is a serious and complex struggle. Party committees at all levels must organize public security organs, courts, procuratorates, and mass organizations such as the Communist Youth League and trade unions to jointly carry out this work. In the struggle, we must pay attention to investigation and research, mobilize the masses, and rely on the masses. Those criminal offenders who endanger the country and the people and have conclusive evidence of their crimes must be arrested and punished according to law. We must never confuse the backward behavior of some people due to certain hooligan habits, as well as general ideological style issues, labor discipline issues, and mass disputes, which have not directly violated the law, with criminal issues. Liaoyang City, Liaoning Province, once mistakenly arrested individuals who did not fully meet the conditions for arrest because it did not clearly delineate policy boundaries. This must be prevented.

    The struggle to eliminate criminal elements such as thugs and bandits must rely on the support of the broad masses of the people. Criminal elements such as thugs and bandits directly endanger the interests and safety of the people, and the people hate them. However, in the past, because the public security and judicial organs were not strong enough in their struggle against these criminals and their law enforcement was not strict, the enthusiasm of the people to fight against criminals was hurt. In order to mobilize the broad masses to rise up in struggle, various localities must select typical criminals and severely punish them in a high-profile manner, so as to explain the policies to the people, show the government's determination to eliminate evil, and dispel the people's ideological concerns. Recently, while holding a sentencing rally for thug and bandit criminals, Dalian City rewarded citizens who reported criminals and also held meetings of the municipal and district people's congresses and held radio broadcasts and exhibitions against thug and bandit criminals, so that the people further recognized the serious harm and class essence of thug and bandit activities and understood the government's determination and policy boundaries, thus rising up to report and expose them, assisting the government in solving cases, so that many major cases were quickly solved. Their experience is useful for all localities.

    In order to build socialism, and for the interests and safety of the country and the people, all localities must take effective measures, continue to carry out the resolute struggle against criminals such as thugs and bandits, and achieve definite results and complete victory in this struggle.

### 把反对流氓盗匪的斗争进行到底

　　把反对流氓盗匪的斗争进行到底
    今年一月份以来，旅大、天津、重庆等地的公安、司法机关和检察机关，接受人民群众的控告，陆续逮捕了许多行凶抢劫、偷盗、诈骗、以及强奸妇女、扰乱社会治安的罪犯，按照情节轻重分别判处了死刑和徒刑。国家机关这种严肃革命法纪和保护人民利益的积极措施，不仅进一步保障了国家的建设事业，而且也进一步团结了人民群众，巩固了人民民主专政。
    但是有一些国家机关工作人员，对于这一斗争的严重意义一直认识不足。例如江西省的公安机关，在上级布置了对流氓盗匪积极斗争的任务以后，一直没有组织必要的力量去领导这一工作。过去一年中江西省发生的凶杀、纵火、放毒等刑事案件，竟有一半没有破获，有的重要案件甚至没有布置侦察和破案，这种严重的麻痹状态和不负责任现象，直接助长了流氓盗匪的气焰，使国家和人民生命、财产的安全得不到应有的保障。
    上海的公安机关，对于破获大案是注意起来了，并且取得了较大成绩；但有一些公安分局似乎瞧不起小案，对于一些小的案件只作登记，不认真布置追查破案，这就使得反革命分子和流氓盗匪分子能够改用“打游击”的方式继续其破坏活动。
    也有一些地区的公安机关，只拣一些容易破获的小案来处理，但对于那些案情复杂、危害重大的案件，则往往不根据实际情况，采取有力措施，以致破案率很低。这是农村和部分小城市较为普遍的现象。河北省是一个破案率比较高的地区，但也有一些重大案件没人过问。如藁城县兴安乡共产党员吴希仲被暗害的案件，这个县的公安机关就一直没有采取坚决的措施来积极破案。
    对流氓盗匪斗争不力是非常错误的，应该纠正。
    旅大、天津等地破获的许多刑事犯罪案件证明，流氓盗匪的犯罪活动往往同漏网的反革命分子、地主、富农和不法资产阶级分子的破坏活动紧密结合在一起。例如黑龙江省呼兰县破获的刘万忠盗匪集团，就是以漏网反革命分子刘万忠为首，纠集地主富农分子、惯盗惯窃分子、流氓恶棍和不法资本家组成的。几年来，他们经常抢劫和偷盗国家和人民的财产，凶杀革命干部和群众积极分子，强奸妇女。旅大市捕获的大盗窃犯王惠德，就曾是
  “五反”运动中的严重违法户。“五反”以后，王犯为了继续破坏国家经济建设，又同流氓惯盗相互勾结，并且以各种卑鄙手段腐蚀和诱骗少年儿童及落后农民几十人，大肆盗窃国家的财物。仅仅国营企业的贵重机械器材，就被他们盗去二百多种。上海破获的所谓“十兄弟”、“三十六股党”等流氓盗匪集团，也是由漏网反革命分子和不法资产阶级分子结合流氓恶棍共同组成的。十分明显，今天的流氓盗匪活动，是带有明显的政治性质的。
    根据这种状况，各地的公安、司法机关、检察机关和党政领导机关，就必须抱定决心把反对流氓盗匪的斗争进行到底，争取彻底的胜利。从党政领导机关来说，领导生产是头等重要的任务，但是如果不能同时注意肃清流氓盗匪，生产的成果就没有保障。必须认识，社会主义建设和社会主义改造的工作，统购统销和商品分配、运输的工作都非常重要；但是如果没有良好的社会秩序，这些工作就都会遭受意想不到的破坏。所以我们不仅不应该任意放弃或放松这一方面的斗争，而且不能容许只破获大案而不破获小案，或者只破获简单案件而不破获复杂案件的偏向。有些地方的公安、司法和检察机关把打击流氓盗匪和打击隐蔽的政治性敌人机械地分开，也是完全不对的。事实上，打击了流氓盗匪，也就会更加孤立了暗藏的间谍特务，甚至会直接暴露出间谍特务。因为流氓盗匪分子往往是特务间谍分子活动的社会基础，一切刑事犯罪活动都给了反革命破坏活动以直接的支持和帮助，而且这两方面的敌人有的现在已经逐渐合流，难于截然分割。应该使大家了解：打击特务间谍和流氓盗匪，都是长期的斗争任务，因此就必须结合起来进行。
    打击流氓盗匪等犯罪分子，是一个严重的复杂的斗争，各级党委必须组织公安机关、法院和检察机关以及青年团和工会等群众团体，共同协力进行。斗争中必须注意调查研究，发动群众和依靠群众。对于那些危害国家和人民确有罪证的刑事犯罪分子，必须依法逮捕惩办。对于一部分群众因为沾染了某些流氓习气而发生的落后行为，以及一般的思想作风问题、劳动纪律问题和群众纠纷问题，并未直接触犯法律的，则决不应该同刑事犯罪问题混淆起来。辽宁省辽阳市曾因没有划清政策界限而错捕了个别完全不够逮捕条件的人，就是一个例子。这是必须防止的。
    肃清流氓盗匪等刑事犯罪分子的斗争，必须依靠广大人民群众的支持。流氓盗匪等犯罪分子直接危害着人民群众的利益和安全，人民群众对他们是痛恨的。但是过去因为公安、司法机关对这些犯罪分子斗争不力，执法不严，人民群众同犯罪分子作斗争的积极性受到伤害。为了发动广大群众起来斗争，各地必须选择典型案犯，大张旗鼓地严厉惩办，借以向人民群众交代政策，表明政府的除恶决心，解除人民群众的思想顾虑。最近旅大市在召开对流氓盗匪犯罪分子宣判大会的同时，奖励了检举罪犯的公民，又召开了市、区人民代表大会会议，举办了反对流氓盗匪犯罪分子的广播会和展览会，使人民群众进一步认识了流氓盗匪活动的严重危害性和阶级实质，了解政府的决心和政策界限，因而纷纷起来密告和检举，协助政府破案，使许多大案都迅速破获了。他们的这种经验，对各地都是有用的。
    为了建设社会主义，为了国家和人民的利益和安全，各地必须采取有效的措施，再接再厉地开展对流氓盗匪等犯罪分子的坚决斗争，使这一斗争取得确定的成绩和完全的胜利。
