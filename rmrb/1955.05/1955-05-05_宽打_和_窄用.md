"Loose Budgeting" and "Tight Spending"
　　Kǒng Sāng
Some leading cadres in industrial and mining enterprises always set their capital construction investment plans higher than their actual needs. When making raw material consumption plans, they always set the planned consumption higher than the actual consumption. When setting work-hour quota plans, they also set the planned work hours higher than the actual work hours. In a word, they set the plans very "loosely."

Why set the plans so "loosely"? It is said that this is for "insurance." But isn't this a waste? They would say: Although we "budget loosely," we can "spend tightly," so there will be no waste. Unfortunately, practice has not proven the correctness of their "theory."

"Loose budgeting" often does not lead to "tight spending." When the state-owned Tianjin Cigarette Factory was compiling its cost plan for 1954, it overestimated the actual cost performance of 1953 by 1.8 million yuan. The various consumption quotas in the cost plan, especially the consumption quota for tobacco leaves, were set higher than the actual usage. On this basis, they formulated a "cost reduction" plan. As a result, in production, few people thought of "tightly using" tobacco leaves and reducing consumption. They simply maintained the previous year's level easily and happily, and "overfulfilled" the cost reduction plan every month and every quarter. By the end of September, they had already completed 82.95 percent of the total annual reduction. Unfortunately, the good times did not last. In the fourth quarter, the state required the factory to further reduce costs by 5.03 percent based on the actual cost of 1953. Calculated in this way, only 48.07 percent of the annual plan was completed from January to September, and more than half of the task had to be completed in the fourth quarter. After the plan was made so "tight," all the employees of the factory became nervous: they reorganized the technical force, calibrated the weight of the cigarettes, strictly controlled the moisture content of the tobacco shreds, and improved the output rate. Finally, they reduced the consumption of tobacco leaves and other materials, and overfulfilled the cost reduction task. Afterwards, the factory leaders calculated the accounts and found that if the tobacco leaf consumption of the fourth quarter was used as the standard for the whole year, then a total of 325,000 kilograms of tobacco leaves were wasted in the first three quarters. These tobacco leaves could produce more than 5,000 cases of cigarettes, increasing the country's income by more than 1 million yuan.

The same employees, using the same equipment and raw materials, and producing the same specifications of products, only because of the difference between "loose" and "tight" plans, the raw material consumption was so disparate. This shows that the result of "loose budgeting" is simply to open the door to waste. Only advanced plans can motivate people to save and tap potential. The great organizational role of socialist economic planning lies in this.

Even if, as some comrades say: "Loose budgeting" does not lead to "loose spending," but is really "tight spending," it is still wrong. Because if the consumption amount of raw materials is budgeted too loosely, or the construction investment is budgeted too loosely, it will occupy more of the country's useful funds. The "looser" the plan is budgeted, the more funds will be tied up, and the greater the harm to the country!

Therefore, from any point of view, "loose budgeting and tight spending" is unacceptable; we must "budget tightly and spend tightly"!

### “宽打”和“窄用”

    “宽打”和“窄用”
　　孔桑
    有些工矿企业的领导干部，在制定基本建设投资计划时，总是把计划用钱数订得比实际需要的大；订原材料消耗计划时，总是把计划消耗量订得比实际消耗量高；订工时定额计划时，也是把计划工时订得比实际工时多。一句话，就是把计划订得很“宽”。
    为什么要把计划订得“宽”些呢？据说这是为了“保险”。这样岂不浪费吗？他们会说：虽然“宽打”，但可以“窄用”，并不会浪费。可惜，实践并没有证明他们的“理论”的正确。
  “宽打”之后往往并不能“窄用”。国营天津卷烟厂编制一九五四年成本计划时，把一九五三年成本完成的实绩多估计了一百八十万元，成本计划中各项消耗定额，尤其是烟叶的消耗定额，订得比实际用的都高。他们就在这样的基础上制定了
  “降低成本”的计划。结果在生产中，很少有人想到应该“窄用”烟叶，降低消耗量，只是轻松愉快地维持着前一年的水平，就每月每季都容容易易地“超额完成”了降低成本计划。到九月末，已经完成了全年应降低总额的百分之八十二点九五。可惜，好景不长，到了第四季，国家要求这个工厂以一九五三年实际成本为基数，再降低百分之五点零三。这样一算，一至九月只完成全年计划的百分之四十八点零七，还有一半以上的任务要在第四季度内完成。计划这样打“紧”以后，全厂职工都紧张起来了：重新组织技术力量，标定烟支重量，严格控制烟丝水份，提高出丝率。最后，终于降低了烟叶和其它材料的消耗量，超额完成了降低成本任务。事后，这个厂的领导同志算了一笔账，发现如果全年都以第四季度的烟叶消耗量为标准，则前三个季度共浪费了烟叶三十二万五千公斤。用这些烟叶可以生产五千多箱卷烟，给国家增加收入一百多万元。
    同样的职工，使用同样的设备和原料，生产同样规格的产品，只是因为计划“宽”和“紧”的不同，原料消耗量就如此悬殊。这就说明了“宽打”的结果，只是给浪费打开了方便之门。而只有先进的计划才能推动人们去节约，去发掘潜力。社会主义经济计划的伟大组织作用正在于此。
    退一步说，即使像有些同志所说的：“宽打”以后并不“宽用”，而真是“窄用”，也是不对的。因为把原材料的消耗额打得宽了，或者把建设投资打得宽了，就要多占用国家的有用资金，计划打得愈“宽”，积压的资金就愈多，对国家的害处也就愈大！
    因此，不论从哪一点来说，“宽打窄用”是要不得的；必须“紧打紧用”！
