　　Xi'an is Under Construction
　　Wu Siceng
    The ancient city of Xi'an is presenting a scene of intense construction. Trains on the Longhai Railway are bringing large quantities of building materials from Anshan Iron and Steel, Shanghai, Shijingshan, Benxi and other places; thousands of trucks, horse-drawn carts, and handcarts are transporting building materials to construction sites day and night along the newly built dozens of wide roads leading to various construction sites. Thousands of construction hoists, mixers, and loaders have been shipped from Changchun, Beijing, Shanghai and other places, and some have already been installed on-site and have begun production. Large hardware factories, lumber mills, wood processing plants and other prefabrication factories are stepping up the production of prefabricated steel components and prefabricated doors and windows. The largest metal structure factory in Northwest China has been basically completed and will soon be able to produce a large number of large factory steel roof trusses. Currently, tens of thousands of construction workers have been put into production. At night, the city is brightly lit, and the sounds of motors, machines, and rhythmic pile-driving songs fill this ancient city with youthful vitality!
    Xi'an is an important city in Northwest China. The Longhai Railway passes through here, extending westward to Tianshui and Lanzhou, and connecting with the Tianlan and Lanxin Railways; eastward, it reaches Haizhou, connecting with the Jinghan and Jinpu Railways. The city is located in the center of the cotton and wheat-producing Qinchuan Plain, with the famous Weibei coalfield and Yanchang oil field to the north, and the Qinling and Bashan Mountains to the south, which contain large reserves of iron ore and timber; it has the conditions to be built into an industrial city.
    Although Xi'an is such a good place, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation, there were only a few small flour mills, match factories, and a private textile factory; and a small, dilapidated power plant. People drank bitter water all year round, and never dreamed of being able to drink tap water. Most of the houses workers lived in were "shacks," half underground and half above ground. The area near Xi'an is a cotton-producing area, but the people wore ragged clothes all year round.
    Today, this ancient city has become the center of the Northwest textile industry. The new Xi'an Textile Factory and State-owned No. 3 Cotton Mill have already been completed. The first large-scale printing and dyeing factory in the Northwest is also being built here. The first new-type cotton weaving factory in the Northwest has started producing beautiful bed sheets. The main buildings of the largest state-owned No. 4 Cotton Mill in the Northwest have been basically completed and the machinery is being tested. The state-owned No. 5 Cotton Mill, which is even larger than the state-owned No. 4 Cotton Mill, is also about to begin construction.
    Xi'an has also established the first automated power plant in the Northwest, and has built a tap water plant, an enamel factory, and a pharmaceutical factory. In addition, there are the newly built largest railway factory in the Northwest, a mine machinery repair factory, a large hardware factory, an agricultural machinery factory, a pesticide factory, and printing plants and automated flour mills with new equipment. The large hardware factory directly serves the basic construction. Before the factory was built in 1952, there were only sixty or so people in the hardware factory, and they could only produce a small number of rivets, screws and other iron parts. Now the number of workers has increased more than tenfold, and many machines are new, and they can already produce large steel windows and prefabricated steel components.
    Xi'an, marching towards a socialist industrial city, is also the center of the Northwest region for training construction talents for the country. Northwest University, Northwest Medical College, Northwest Normal College, Northwest Russian College and other seven universities have been newly built and expanded here. Construction Engineering School, Petroleum School, Geology School, Coal Mining School, Highway School, Health School and other secondary technical schools are all located here. Students from all over the country and from various ethnic groups are studying here. Xi'an newly built and expanded twenty-six secondary schools last year, and sent more than 7,000 graduates from senior high schools, junior high schools and secondary technical schools to the country. Their footprints have spread all over the motherland. This year, another ten ordinary middle schools and secondary technical schools will be newly built and expanded, and a large number of university graduates, middle school and secondary technical school graduates will be sent to the country.
    The people of Xi'an are proud of their increasingly happy lives. The state has arranged a happy life for the people. In recent years, more than 160,000 square meters of dormitories have been built near various factories, and most workers and their families have happily moved from "shacks" into new homes. Nearly a hundred newly built and expanded hospitals, health centers, health stations and other health care departments, of which more than fifty provide free services to employees. The Clock Tower, which is loved by the people, has been completely renovated, and the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, the Small Wild Goose Pagoda, and the "Stele Forest," which is famous at home and abroad, have also been properly renovated. During festivals and holidays, people gather here to admire the creations of the ancient working people. Now, the city has newly built four new-type theaters, has more than twenty theater troupes, and eight cinemas. People can get proper entertainment after hard work. In addition, three parks and a huge stadium that can accommodate 30,000 spectators have been renovated. A swimming pool and a large park with an area of 700 mu will also be built for the working people to rest. Sanatoriums for workers and soldiers have been built under Mount Lintong in the eastern suburbs and in the southern suburbs, and free bathhouses have been specially set up for farmers.
    Technical personnel from all over the country, especially from Shanghai, have given strong support to Xi'an. Recently, about 10,000 workers and technicians have been transferred from Shanghai.
    The socialist industrial construction of Xi'an not only inspires the technicians and workers who support the construction, but also inspires the people of the whole country.

　　西安在建设中
　　吴嗣澄
    古老的西安，呈现着一片紧张建设的景象。陇海铁路的火车，从鞍钢、上海、石景山、本溪等地运来了大批建筑材料；数千辆汽车、马车和架子车，沿着新修的数十条通向各工地的宽阔的马路，日夜不停地把建筑材料运进了施工现场。数千件施工用的卷扬机、搅拌机、装卸机，已经由长春、北京、上海源源运到，有些已经在现场上安装起来开始生产。大型的五金厂、制材厂、木材加工厂等预制工厂，正加紧生产钢铁预制构件和预制门窗。西北最大的金属结构厂已经基本修好，不久就可以生产大量的大型厂房钢铁屋架了。目前，数万名建筑工人已投入了生产。入夜，灯火辉煌，马达声、机器声和有节奏的夯歌，使这座古城充满了青春的活力！
    西安是我国西北的一个重要城市，陇海铁路经过这里，往西，直到天水、兰州，和天兰、兰新铁路接连；往东，直到海州，和京汉、津浦铁路接连。这座城市座落在盛产棉麦的八百里秦川的中央，北面有著名的渭北煤田和延长石油矿，南面的秦岭和巴山，蕴藏着大量的铁矿和木材；具备了建成工业城市的条件。
    西安虽然是这样一个好地方，解放前在国民党反动派的统治下，只有几家小型的面粉厂、火柴厂和一家私营纺织厂；一个小型的破烂电厂。人们成年喝着苦水，连做梦也没想到能喝到自来水，工人住的房子，大部分是半截地上，半截在土里的“窝棚”。西安附近是产棉区，可是人民却整年穿破衣裳。
    如今，这座古老的城市已经成为西北纺织工业的中心。新型的西安纺织厂、国棉三厂早已建成。西北第一座大型印染厂也在这里建设起来。西北第一座新型的棉织厂，已经开工生产漂亮的床单。西北最大型的国棉四厂的厂房，已基本建成，正在试装机器。比国棉四厂还要大的国棉五厂，也将要动工兴建。
    西安还建立了西北第一座自动化的发电厂，修起了自来水厂、搪瓷厂和制药厂。此外还有新建的西北最大的铁路工厂，矿山机械修配厂、大型的五金厂、农械厂、农药厂，还有新式设备的印刷厂、自动化面粉厂等。大型的五金厂，是直接为基本建设施工服务的。一九五二年建厂以前的五金厂，只有六十几个人，只能生产不多的铆钉、螺丝等铁件。现在工人比过去增加十倍以上，很多机器都是新式的，已经能生产大型钢窗钢铁预制构件了。
    向着社会主义工业城市迈进的西安，又是西北地区为国家培养建设人才的中心。西北大学、西北医学院、西北师范学院、西北俄文专科学校等七所高等学校，已经在这里新建和扩建起来。建筑工程学校、石油学校、地质学校、煤矿学校、公路学校、卫生学校等中等技术学校，都设在这里。在这里学习的有来自各地的各族人民的儿女。西安在去年就新建和扩建了二十六所中等学校，给国家输送的高、初中毕业生和中等技术学校毕业生，就有七千多名。他们的足迹已遍及祖国各地。今年还要新建、扩建十所普通中学和中等技术学校，将给国家输送大批大学毕业生、中学和中等技术学校毕业生。
    西安人民为自己一天比一天幸福的生活而自豪。国家为人民安排了幸福的生活。几年来，在各工厂附近已经盖了十六万多平方公尺的宿舍，大部分工人和他们的家属，都愉快地从“窝棚”搬进新居。新建和扩建的近百所医院、卫生所、保健站等保健部门，其中有五十多处为职工免费服务。人民喜爱的钟楼，已经彻底翻修，大雁塔、小雁塔和中外闻名的“碑林”，也进行了适当的整修。每逢节日、假日，人们都集聚在这里，欣赏着古代劳动人民的创造。现在，全市已经新建了四个新型的剧院、有二十多个剧团、八个电影院，人民在辛勤的劳动以后，可以得到适当的娱乐。另外，还整修了三个公园、一座巨大的能容纳三万个观众的体育场。还要修建一个游泳池和一个方圆七百亩的大公园，供劳动人民休息。在东郊的临潼山下和南郊，盖起了工人和战士的疗养院，还专门为农民设立了免费浴池。
    全国各地，特别是上海的技术人员，给了西安以有力的支援。最近一个时期，由上海调来的工人和技术人员，就有一万人左右。
    西安的社会主义工业建设，不仅鼓舞着支援建设的技术人员们和工人们，也鼓舞着全国的人们。
