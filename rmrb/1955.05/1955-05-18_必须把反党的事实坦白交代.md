Must Confess Anti-Party Facts Honestly
    Bang Li
    I am a staff member of the Central Biological Research Institute. I believe that Hu Feng's self-criticism is extremely hypocritical. Although Hu Feng said that this ideological movement has helped him and expressed his willingness to conduct self-examination and accept reform, it is difficult to see from his article that he has a sincere attitude towards ideological self-examination. In many places, he is even defending himself, describing the anti-Party clique as "in line with the party's political program"... and praising himself as, for many years before liberation, in the eyes of the masses, he was "not only a pure writer, but also an organizer of literary work standing around the Party." At the same time, we can easily see clearly from the "materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party group" revealed by Shu Wu that the Hu Feng anti-Party group was entirely organized secretly by him single-handedly, in order to oppose the Party and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies and set up a separate court. This anti-Party group has always used vicious slander and curses to attack progressive writers, and is completely not the "pure writer" he claims to be. Hu Feng's methods are extremely despicable and vicious. We cannot see any revolutionary spirit in him, nor any contribution to the revolution at that time.
    There must be more people in the Hu Feng clique who have received secret letters from Hu Feng. Therefore, I completely agree with the opinion of the "People's Daily." Lu Ling and others who have had secret correspondence with Hu Feng should actively and unreservedly hand over all these materials, thoroughly expose all the activities and secrets of the Hu Feng anti-Party group, and help the Party to clarify the whole situation of this anti-Party group. Shu Wu's bold exposure is welcome.

　  必须把反党的事实坦白交代
    邦立
    我是中央生物研究所的工作人员。我认为胡风的那篇检讨是极其虚伪的。虽然胡风说这次思想运动对他有帮助，表示愿意进行检查，接受改造，但是，从他的文章中，却难于看到他有愿意虚心进行思想检查的态度，甚至在很多地方还在替自己辩解，把反党的小集团说成是什么“符合党的政治纲领”……，并自许为解放前许多年，在群众眼睛中，他“不仅是一个单纯的作家，而且是一个站在党底周围的文学工作的组织者”。同时，我们也极容易从舒芜所揭发的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”中清楚地看到，胡风的反党集团，完全是他一手包办、秘密组织起来的，以便同党和毛主席的文艺政策作对，分庭抗礼。这个反党集团一贯以恶毒的诬蔑、诅咒来打击进步的作家，完全不是他自己所自许的那样是什么“单纯的作家”。胡风的手段是极其卑鄙的、毒辣的，我们完全看不出他有半点革命气息，对当时革命有什么贡献。
    胡风小集团中一定会有更多的人得到过胡风的密信，因此我完全同意“人民日报”的意见。路翎和其他同胡风有密信来往的人应当积极地全部无保留地把这些材料交出来，彻底地揭发出胡风反党集团的一切勾当、黑幕，帮助党弄清这个反党集团的全部情况。舒芜的大胆揭发是值得欢迎的。
