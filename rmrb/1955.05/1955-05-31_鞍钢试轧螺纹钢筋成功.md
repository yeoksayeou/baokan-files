　  Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small rolling mill has successfully trial-produced threaded steel rebar. The first batch of threaded steel rebar rolled on May 19th was of good quality. Anshan Iron and Steel will soon mass-produce this new product for various regions.
      Threaded steel rebar is a new product that the Soviet Union has only recently developed in the past few years. Its surface is threaded, has high internal friction, and is strong. Using it in construction projects can save more than 20% of steel compared to ordinary steel rebar. After Soviet expert Comrade Milekin suggested that Anshan Iron and Steel trial-roll this product, workers in the roll casting workshop and the first machine repair workshop, under the guidance of Soviet experts, improved the methods of casting and processing rolls and manufactured standard threaded steel rebar rolls.

　  鞍钢试轧螺纹钢筋成功
      鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂试轧螺纹钢筋成功。五月十九日轧制的第一批螺纹钢筋质量很好。鞍钢即将为各地大量生产这种新产品。
      螺纹钢筋是苏联在最近几年才研究成功的一种新产品。它的表面是螺纹形状，内摩擦力大，强度高，拿它用在建筑工程上可以比普通钢筋节省百分之二十以上的钢材。苏联专家米列金建议鞍钢试轧这种产品以后，轧辊铸造车间和第一机修车间的工人，在苏联专家的指导下，改进了铸造和加工轧辊的方法，制造了合乎标准的轧制螺纹钢筋轧辊。
