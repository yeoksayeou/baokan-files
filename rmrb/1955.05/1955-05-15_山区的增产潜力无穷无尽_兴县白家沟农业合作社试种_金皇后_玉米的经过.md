　　"Grow What You Eat" Hindered Grain Production
　　Baijiagou in Xingxian County, Shanxi Province, is a place with barren land, impoverished people, and drought nine years out of ten. Although each person here has more than five mu of hillside land, in the past, even in good years, each mu could only produce a little over forty jin of coarse grains. In order to escape poverty, people organized an agricultural production cooperative as early as the spring of 1944 (then called a land cooperative). After the establishment of the cooperative, under the condition of unified land management, although the members put a lot of effort into cultivation, the potential for increased land production was not realized due to the old-fashioned idea of "grow what you eat." Before 1952, the cooperative cultivated as many as nineteen kinds of crops, of which low-yield crops accounted for one-third; moreover, it never implemented planting according to local conditions. Therefore, although the cooperative had been established for several years, the average yield per mu reached a maximum of only ninety-one jin. Was it possible to increase production by changing dry land into paddy fields? There has always been a shortage of water here, and people used to say: "The Baijia Mountains are a dry valley, and the yellow flagstone underground is thirty-six zhang thick." That is to say, it is a waste of effort to dig wells here. Even the people here drink kongshan water (i.e., rainwater stored in mountain caves and depressions), let alone think about having water to irrigate the land. Because production could not be increased, people began to dislike their village, and some members planned to move down the mountain. They said: Socialism is good, but our Hongyashigou will never reach it.

　　Historically High Yields
　　In the autumn of 1952, just as the members were thinking about moving down the mountain, the cooperative director Jia Baozhi returned from a visit to the Soviet Union. In order to completely change the poor situation of Baijiagou, he studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with the committee members. In addition to making appropriate arrangements for animal husbandry and forestry, he specifically proposed to carry out basic land construction, dig wells, build terraces, and increase the yield per unit area. As soon as this opinion was put forward, the members began to argue. Some said, "We have exhausted our efforts in farming in the past few years, and the yield per mu is just that. What extent can it be increased?" Many members especially disagreed with digging wells. They said: Since ancient times, we have relied on the heavens for food, so don't even think about digging wells! Everyone brought up the old saying "the yellow flagstone underground is thirty-six zhang thick." After Jia Baozhi gave the members a detailed introduction of the examples of the Odessa region of the Soviet Union building reservoirs and cultivating vegetable gardens on the mountains, and the committee members calculated the benefits of turning dry land into paddy fields, which can solve the difficulty of drinking water and increase grain production, the members' confidence was increased. The members said: No one has ever seen the thirty-six zhang thick yellow flagstone, so let's dig a well and see. Because everyone had confidence, the first well in the history of Baijiagou was dug in a very short period of time.

　　After the well was successfully dug, people no longer had to drink kongshan water; at the same time, everyone wanted to use the well water to increase the yield per unit area. At that time, some people advocated using water to irrigate the land and grow vegetables, while others advocated growing millet; but Jia Baozhi's opinion was: to increase production, it is best to grow the high-yield crop Golden Queen corn. This opinion was again opposed by people. Originally, this area had never grown corn. In the seventeen counties of the Xinxian Special Region, except for a very small part of the plains in Xinxian, Dingxiang, and Guo Counties, the remaining fourteen counties did not grow this crop at all. Although some counties grew some small corn, they did not grow it on the whole piece of land, but only planted a little bit on the edges of the fields for people to eat young corn. A few families in Baijiagou had grown dozens of small corn trees by the vegetable fields, but because they did not grow well, they had died out as early as ten years ago. Therefore, the members believed that it was very unsafe to grow this crop. As a result of the debate, it was decided to try planting Golden Queen corn on half of the four mu and two fen of irrigated land. When planning the production target, the committee members proposed eight hundred jin per mu. When everyone heard this number, they waved their hands and said: You are taking risks again! The two production team leaders in the cooperative, Jia Aidu and Jia Wusheng, were even more worried. They said: We will listen to your commands on how to grow crops, but we cannot be responsible for the yield of Golden Queen! Finally, the committee members contracted the two mu and one fen of Golden Queen corn land (the cooperative had implemented contracting work and production). These two mu of land were newly built terraces, and the soil was not very good, with both ripe soil and raw soil. In addition to applying eighty dan of base fertilizer per mu, they also applied three top dressings after the corn seedlings emerged; when the corn was tasseling, artificial pollination was carried out: as a result, the corn grew thick and tall, like a bamboo forest.

　　In the autumn of 1953, the cooperative's crops achieved a bumper harvest, especially the Golden Queen corn, which yielded 925 jin per mu, which was a miracle in the history of Baijiagou. From then on, some old people in the village and cooperative changed their tune and no longer said "the yield per mu is just that," and increased their confidence in building their village.

　　Hillside Land Can Also Have a Bumper Harvest
　　In the spring of 1954, when the Baijiagou Agricultural Cooperative was formulating the internal production plan, it first reduced the original nineteen kinds of crops to eleven and implemented planting according to local conditions. However, there was another division of opinion on the issue of expanding the planting area of Golden Queen corn. The committee members advocated planting fifty mu, but the members disagreed. The reason for the disagreement was that last year the Golden Queen corn had a bumper harvest only when planted on irrigated land, and it would not be safe to plant it on hillside land; but the cooperative only had the four mu and two fen of newly built irrigated land last year, so how could it plant fifty mu of Golden Queen? Because Golden Queen corn is a high-yield crop that requires a lot of water and fertilizer, the committee took into account everyone's opinions and finally decided that in addition to planting all four mu and two fen of irrigated land, it would only conduct trial planting on thirteen mu and five fen of better hillside land. Last year, Baijiagou suffered from spring drought and autumn floods, and the production of many crops was reduced, but only the Golden Queen corn was not affected by the drought because it was planted earlier, and it did not suffer from the autumn floods because it grew taller. Not only was production not reduced, but there was also a bumper harvest. The four mu and two fen of irrigated land yielded 1,170 jin per mu, and the hillside corn yielded 452 jin per mu. This greatly encouraged the members of the Baijiagou Agricultural Cooperative to cultivate high-yield crops on hillside land.

　　This year, the Baijiagou Agricultural Cooperative has decided to appropriately expand the planting area of Golden Queen corn on the basis of last year, according to the specific soil quality and fertilizer conditions of the cooperative's land.

　　Played a Demonstrative Role
　　The fact that Baijiagou succeeded in digging wells and obtained high yields from planting Golden Queen corn proves that the production potential of mountainous areas is great. Last year, seven agricultural cooperatives in Baijiagou's township, including Lijia Yan and Xigou, successively dug wells and cultivated Golden Queen corn. Last autumn, the district committee of Baijiagou organized the township party branch secretaries and agricultural cooperative directors of the entire district to visit Baijiagou. Last winter, the Xingxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China promoted the experience of planting corn on hillside land in Baijiagou at the agricultural cooperative director training class and the county people's committee's county-wide labor model conference. Last year, the county's 416 agricultural cooperatives planted only 906 mu of corn on irrigated land and plains, and this year it is planned to expand the planting area to 7,100 mu. The Xinxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has universally promoted this experience throughout the prefecture. Most of the hillside agricultural cooperatives in Baode, Hequ, Pianguan, Lanxian, and Jingle Counties are planning to plant a large number of high-yield crops of Golden Queen corn this year.

　　山区的增产潜力无穷无尽
　　——兴县白家沟农业合作社试种“金皇后”玉米的经过

    “吃啥种啥”阻碍了粮食增产
      山西省兴县白家沟是一个地瘠民贫、十年九旱的地方。这里每人虽然有五亩多山坡地，但过去在年景好时，每亩只能产四十多斤粗粮。人们为了摆脱贫困，早在一九四四年春天就组织了农业生产合作社
  （当时称土地合作社）。社建立后，在土地统一经营的条件下，社员们在耕作上虽然出了很大力气，但由于存在着“吃啥种啥”的守旧思想，土地的增产潜力没有发挥出来。一九五二年以前，这个社种植的作物共有十九种之多，其中低产作物就占了三分之一；而且始终没有实行因地种植。因此，这个社虽然成立了好几年，平均每亩产量最高只达到九十一斤。是不是可以用旱地变水地的方法来增加产量呢？这里从来就缺水，人们流传着这样一句话：
  “白家山下是干谷，地下的黄板石厚三丈六。”就是说，在这里打井是白费工的。这里连人吃的都是空山水（即山洞、山洼积存的雨水），更不用想有水来浇地了。因为产量不能提高，人们对自己的村庄开始厌弃了，有些社员打算搬家下山。他们说：社会主义虽好，可是咱这红崖石沟，永远也到不了。
      有史以来的高额产量
    一九五二年秋天，正在社员想搬家下山的时候，社长贾保执从苏联参观回来了。为了彻底改变白家沟的贫困面貌，他同社务委员们研究了苏联的先进经验，除了对畜牧业和林业作了适当安排外，特别提出要进行土地基本建设，打井、修梯田，提高单位面积产量。这意见一提出，社员们就争论开了，有的说：“这几年种地把劲都使绝了，每亩产量就是那些，再增产还能增到什么地步？”许多社员特别不同意打井，他们说：自古以来咱们就是靠老天爷吃饭，打井的事干脆不要打算！大家你一言我一语地又把“地下黄板石厚三丈六”的老话搬了出来。经过贾保执把苏联奥德萨州在山上修筑水库、培植菜园的事例给社员们作了详细介绍，社务委员们又把旱地变水田，既能解决吃水困难，又能增加粮食产量的好处，给社员作了计算以后，才提高了社员的信心。社员们说：三丈六厚的黄板石究竟谁也没见过，咱们倒要打个井试试看。由于大家有了信心，结果在很短的时间内，就打出了白家沟有史以来的第一眼水井。
    打井成功后，人们再不用吃空山水了；同时人们都想要利用井水来提高单位面积产量。当时有的人主张用水浇地种菜，有的人主张种谷；可是贾保执的意见是：要多增产，最好是种高产作物金皇后玉米。这意见又遭到人们的反对。原来这带地方从来没有种过玉米。忻县专区十七个县，除忻县、定襄、崞县等三县的平川地区种很少一部分外，其余十四个县根本不种这种作物。有的县虽种些小玉米，但是也不在整块地上种，只是在地畔上捎带种上一点，供人们吃些嫩玉米。白家沟原来有几家在菜地边上种过几十棵小玉米，因为长的不好，所以早在十年前就绝种了。因此，社员们都认为种这种作物很不保险。争论结果，决定用四亩二分水浇地的一半试种金皇后玉米。当计划产量数字时，社务委员们提出每亩八百斤。大伙一听这个数字，都摆手说：你们又是冒险哩！社里的两个生产队长贾挨多、贾务生更是耽心，他们说：怎样作务庄稼我们全听你们指挥，唯有金皇后这个产量我们可不敢负责任！最后，社务委员们把这二亩一分金皇后玉米地包下来（这个社已实行包工包产）种了。这二亩多地是新修的梯田，土质不算好，有熟土，有生土。他们除每亩施底肥八十担以外，在玉米出苗以后，又施了三次追肥；玉米出穗时，实行了人工授粉：结果玉米长的又粗又高，好像一片竹林。
    一九五三年秋天，这个社的庄稼获得了丰收，特别是金皇后玉米每亩产量竟达九百二十五斤，这是白家沟有史以来的奇迹。从这以后，村里、社里的一些老年人转换了话头，再不说“每亩产量就是那些”的话了，对建设自己的村庄增加了信心。
      山坡地上也能丰收
    一九五四年春天，白家沟农业合作社在制定社内生产计划时，首先把原来的十九种作物减缩到十一种，并实行了因地种植。可是在扩大金皇后玉米播种面积的问题上意见又有了分歧，社务委员们主张种五十亩，社员们不同意。不同意的理由是：去年金皇后玉米是种在水地上才丰收，如在山地上种就不保险；可是全社只有去年新修的四亩二分水地，哪能种五十亩金皇后？因为金皇后玉米是一种需水需肥比较多的高产作物，社务委员会考虑了大家的意见，最后确定除把四亩二分水地全部种植外，只在十三亩五分较好的山地上进行了试种。去年，白家沟遭了春旱秋涝的灾害，许多作物都减了产，只有金皇后玉米，因为种得早些，没有遇旱，秋涝时又长高了没有受涝，不仅没有减产，而且全部丰收了。四亩二分水地玉米，每亩产了一千一百七十斤，山地玉米每亩产了四百五十二斤。这样一来，大大鼓起了白家沟农业合作社社员们在山地上培植高产作物的勇气。
      今年白家沟农业合作社根据社内土地的土质和肥料的具体情况，决定在去年的基础上，适当扩大金皇后玉米的种植面积。
      起了示范作用
    白家沟打井成功、种金皇后玉米获得高额产量的事实，证明了山区的生产潜力是很大的。去年白家沟所在乡的李家墕、西沟等七个农业合作社，先后都打了井，培植了金皇后玉米。去年秋季，白家沟所在区的区委组织了全区的乡支部书记、农业合作社长到白家沟参观。去年冬天，中共兴县县委在农业合作社社长训练班和县人民委员会召开的全县劳动模范大会上推广了白家沟山地种玉米的经验。去年全县四百一十六个农业合作社只在水地、平地上种了九百零六亩玉米，今年准备扩大种植面积到七千一百亩。中共忻县地委已把这一经验向全专区普遍推广。保德、河曲、偏关、岚县、静乐等几县大部山地农业合作社，今年都准备大量种植高产作物金皇后玉米。
