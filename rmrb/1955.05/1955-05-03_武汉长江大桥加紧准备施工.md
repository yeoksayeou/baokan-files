The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge main bridge project is about to officially commence construction. Various preparatory works are being accelerated.

At the foot of Turtle Mountain and Snake Mountain on both sides of the Yangtze River, builders have begun to set up four large bridgehead construction sites. Some are leveling the foundations, while others are starting to move houses and install machinery. The special railway transportation line from the Hanyang Railway Station yard to the Hanyang bridgehead construction sites, as well as waterproof walls to ensure safe construction at the sites, are also under construction. Several thousand mechanical road builders and laborers are working against the rain to complete the laying of the tracks for the special railway line before May Day. They are striving to build the waterproof walls before the Yangtze River's high-water season.

Many machine tools, hoisting and transportation vessels, power equipment, and other items needed for mechanized and factory-based construction have begun to be transported from various locations to the riverside and construction sites. The Changsha Repair Factory, affiliated with the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, has also recently moved from Changsha to the construction site, preparing to expand into a central repair factory with manufacturing capabilities. In addition, a number of concrete mixing plants, concrete component prefabrication plants, timber processing plants, and two mechanical hoisting docks will be successively established at the construction site.

The three bridge engineering teams responsible for the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge are also currently being organized at an accelerated pace. Many technicians and workers have gathered here from all over the country, actively studying various technologies needed for construction. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　武汉长江大桥加紧准备施工
    武汉长江大桥正桥工程将正式开工。施工前的各项准备工作正在加紧进行。
    在长江两岸的龟山和蛇山脚下，建筑者已着手布置四个很大的桥头工地，有的正在平整地基，有的开始搬迁房屋、安装机具。从汉阳车站站场通向汉阳桥头各工地的专用铁路运输线和保证工地安全施工的防水墙也在修筑中。几千名机械筑路工人和民工冒雨赶工，在“五一”前夕铺通了铁路专用线的轨道，他们正在争取在长江大汛前筑好防水墙。
    进行机械化和工厂化施工需要的许多机床、起重和运输船舶、动力设备等，已开始从各地运到江边和工地。武汉长江大桥工程局所属的长沙修配厂，最近也已从长沙迁到工地上，准备扩建成为一个有制造能力的中心修配工厂。此外，工地还将陆续建立起若干混凝土搅拌工厂、混凝土构件预制厂、木材加工厂以及两个机械起重码头。
    担负武汉长江大桥工程施工任务的三个桥梁工程队目前也正在加紧组织中。许多技术人员和工人已从全国各地纷纷汇集到这里，他们都在积极地学习施工中需用的各种技术。（据新华社讯）
