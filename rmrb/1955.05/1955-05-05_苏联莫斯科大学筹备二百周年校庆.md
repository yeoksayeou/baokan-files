Soviet Moscow University Prepares for 200th Anniversary Celebration

This year, on May 7th, the Soviet State Moscow Lomonosov University will celebrate its 200th anniversary. Professor Ivanov, Vice-Chancellor of Moscow University, introduced the situation of Moscow University on the occasion of receiving reporters.

The State Moscow University is Russia's first university. It was established in 1755 based on the initiative and planning of the great Russian scholar Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov, who came from the people. Moscow University will hold large-scale scientific conferences to celebrate this anniversary. During the conference, there will be a plenary session, departmental meetings, and group meetings. The best Soviet scholars—professors of the State Moscow University—will speak at these meetings. Currently, the departments are holding scientific conferences for university students. The best reports from the students will receive the Lomonosov Prize. To celebrate the bicentennial, the State Moscow University Press has done a lot of work to publish the history of State Moscow University and other scientific works.

On the anniversary, a grand celebration will be held throughout the university. Representatives from universities and colleges across the country, representatives from the scientific, cultural, and educational circles, representatives from industrial and agricultural workers, as well as representatives from universities in people's democratic countries and representatives from the most famous universities in other countries who have been invited to participate in the commemorative meeting will attend the conference. Each department will hold its own celebration conference.

Currently, there are 24,000 people receiving education at the State Moscow University, including approximately 15,500 students in the lecture department, 5,500 students in the correspondence department, approximately 2,000 graduate students and students preparing for doctoral degrees, as well as other students and auditors. This year, Moscow University will have 2,800 young experts graduate, the largest number of graduates since the university was founded.

Since the victory of the revolution, Moscow University has trained more than 40,000 experts. Today, there is probably no school or scientific research institute in the country that does not have students who graduated from Moscow University working there. A. Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, was once a student at Moscow University. The current University President, Academician Petrovsky, is also a graduate of Moscow University. University Professor Academician Skobeltsyn is the Chairman of the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee for "Strengthening International Peace."

Among the professors at Moscow University, there are 30 Academicians and Corresponding Members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and approximately 60 full researchers and corresponding members of the Academies of Sciences of various Union Republics and various departments.

Moscow University continues to expand its contacts with political activists, professors, and scholars from other countries. In 1954 alone, nearly 700 delegations visited the university.

　　苏联莫斯科大学筹备二百周年校庆
    今年五月七日，苏联国立莫斯科洛蒙诺索夫大学将要庆祝二百周年校庆。莫斯科大学副校长伊凡诺夫教授在一次接待记者的场合介绍了莫斯科大学的情况。
    国立莫斯科大学是俄国的第一所大学，它是根据出身于人民中间的俄国伟大学者米·瓦·洛蒙诺索夫的倡议和规划，在一七五五年建立的。莫斯科大学将举行大规模的科学会议来庆祝这个纪念日，会议期间要召开全校大会、各系的全体会议和分组会议，苏联最优秀的学者——国立莫斯科大学的教授们将在这些会议上发言。目前各系正在举行大学生的科学会议。大学生的最优秀的报告将得到洛蒙诺索夫奖金。为了庆祝二百周年纪念，国立莫斯科大学出版社为出版国立莫斯科大学历史和其他科学著作而做了许多工作。
    在纪念日，全校将举行隆重的庆祝会。参加大会的将有全国各大学、各高等学校的代表，科学文化教育界的代表，工农业劳动者的代表，还有应邀前来参加纪念会的人民民主国家各大学的代表以及其他国家最著名的大学的代表。每个系都将举行本系的庆祝大会。
    现在在国立莫斯科大学受教育的共有两万四千人，其中包括：约一万五千五百名讲授部大学生，五千五百名函授部大学生，约二千名研究生和准备考博士学位的学生，以及其他学员和旁听生。今年，莫斯科大学将有两千八百名青年专家毕业，这是该校成立以来毕业人数最多的一次。
    在革命胜利以后，莫斯科大学共已培养了四万多名专家。而现在，大概全国没有任何一个学校和科学研究所里没有莫斯科大学毕业出来的学生在工作。苏联科学院院长阿·涅斯米扬诺夫就曾是莫斯科大学的学生。现任大学校长的彼得罗夫斯基院士也是从莫斯科大学毕业的。大学教授斯科贝尔琴院士是“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金审查委员会主席。
    在莫斯科大学的教授中，有三十名苏联科学院院士和通讯院士，约六十名各加盟共和国科学院和各部门科学院的正式研究员和通讯院士。
    莫斯科大学不断扩大同其他国家的政治活动家、教授和学者的联系。仅在一九五四年一年中间，就有将近七百个代表团到该校参观。
