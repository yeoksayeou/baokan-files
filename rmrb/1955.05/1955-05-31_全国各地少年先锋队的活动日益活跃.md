Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Young Pioneers activities across the country have become increasingly active recently.

　　Young Pioneer teams in various regions regularly hold various educational team meetings to educate children on loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property. Various regions have held team meetings themed around "Beijing - The Heart of Our Motherland," "On the Land of the Motherland," "Our Great Patriotic Poet - Qu Yuan," and "We Want to Be Transformers of Nature," which greatly increased the children's knowledge. In some places, the Young Pioneers organized children to visit nearby coal mines and forests, enabling them to understand the significant uses of coal in industrial construction. As a result, many children hope to become laborers who develop the resources of the motherland in the future.

　　Based on children's preferences, Young Pioneer teams in various regions often assist schools in carrying out various lively and interesting science and technology activities, giving play to children's creativity and imagination. In many regions, children have organized science activity groups focusing on astronomy, electrical engineering, mechanics, physics, animals, and plants. They have created various meaningful models and specimens. Twelve Young Pioneer members from Baoji Junior High School created a model of the Qinling Tunnel project, which included mountains, rivers, bridges, and tunnels. A physics group from the second grade of junior high school at Beijing No. 3 Girls' Middle School created a delicate and ingenious small hydroelectric power station model. The water from the hydroelectric power station flowed down an artificial mountain about one meter high, impacting the blades of a turbine, driving the electric motor, and thus lighting up the lights of the collective farm at the foot of the artificial mountain. The children who built this model said they would like to build a real hydroelectric power station in the future to produce more electricity for the motherland. Children in many places have also made models of airplanes, warships, and submarines.

　　Under the organization of the Young Pioneers, a large number of Young Pioneer members and children frequently participate in social welfare activities such as planting trees, planting sunflowers, repairing books, and visiting families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. This spring, children in various regions responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and carried out planting activities. Many children planted a large number of oil crops for the motherland in their hometowns and near schools. More than 600 children in Beijing participated in the greening work of Longtan Lake, where they planted more than 7,000 trees, which will turn Longtan Lake into a beautiful park when these young trees grow up. Many children have also established close ties with national industrial and agricultural labor models and People's Liberation Army soldiers. Soldiers on the front lines of coastal defense often receive letters of sympathy and gifts from children from all over the country.

　　Children's recreational and sports lives are also very active. A children's wooden ice-skating rink was established in Beijing at the beginning of this year, attracting a large number of children. This year, children in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places held local and national music performances, with nearly 270,000 music-loving children participating in the performances. Beijing, Dalian, and other places have also held city-wide children's art exhibitions.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The Beijing Young Pioneers organization developed more than 20,000 new members in March and April, and now there are nearly 160,000 Young Pioneer members in the city.

　　This year, after the first representative meeting of the Beijing Young Pioneers instructors and the third national conference on children's work were held, the work of the Beijing Young Pioneers has been greatly improved. Many schools that did not have teams in the past have now established Young Pioneer organizations. The Dongdan, Xidan, and Nanyuan districts have eliminated blank spots. Many schools have also established Red Scarf classes, with more than 40 Red Scarf classes in the Xisi district alone.

　　After joining the team, the children became more lively, brave, and eager to make progress. After Dongdan District Xianliang Primary School established a team, the children's enthusiasm for learning generally increased. Zhang Xiuqing, a third-grade student, used to get only 60 or 70 points in her studies, but after joining the team, she achieved 90 points in both Chinese and arithmetic. There was a child in this school who was known throughout the school for hitting people and stealing things. After the school established a team, he was determined to strive to join the team, actively correcting his shortcomings. Now this child is friendly to others and automatically sends things he finds on the road to the police station. In many schools, children who were previously considered "naughty" and "mischievous" and could not join the team joined the team under the team's education and became good members.

　　全国各地少年先锋队的活动日益活跃
    新华社三十日讯　全国各地少年先锋队的活动最近已日益活跃。
    各地少年先锋队经常举行各种有教育意义的队会，向儿童进行爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学和爱护公共财物的教育。各地曾举行了以“北京——我们祖国的心脏”、“在祖国的土地上”、“我们伟大的爱国诗人——屈原”和“我们要做大自然改造者”等为主题的队会活动，增进了儿童们不少的知识。有些地方的少年先锋队组织儿童参观了附近的煤区和森林，使他们懂得了煤在工业建设上的重大用途。许多儿童因此希望自己将来做一个开发祖国资源的劳动者。
    根据儿童们的喜爱，各地少年先锋队经常协助学校开展各种生动有趣的科学工艺活动，发挥儿童们的创造性和想像力。许多地区的少年儿童组织了天文、电工、机械、物理、动物和植物等科学活动小组。他们制作了各种有意义的模型和标本。宝鸡初级中学有十二名少年先锋队员制作了秦岭隧道工程模型，模型中有高山、河流、大桥和隧道。北京市第三女子中学初中二年级的一个物理小组，创作了一座精致灵巧的小水电站模型。水电站的水沿着约一公尺高的假山上流下来，冲击着滑轮机的叶片，带动了电动机，这样，假山下的集体农庄的电灯就亮了。制造这座模型的孩子们说他们愿意将来建设一座真的水力发电站，为祖国生产更多的电力。许多地方的儿童还制作了飞机、军舰和潜水艇等模型。
    广大少年先锋队员和少年儿童在少年先锋队的组织下，经常参加植树、种向日葵、修补图书和慰问革命烈士家属、革命军人家属等社会公益活动。今年春天，各地儿童响应了青年团中央委员会的号召，开展种植活动。许多儿童在自己的家乡和学校附近为祖国种植了大量油料作物。北京市有六百多名少年儿童参加了龙潭的绿化工作，他们在龙潭种了七千多棵树，这些幼树长大后将使龙潭成为一座美丽的公园。许多儿童还和全国工业、农业劳动模范及人民解放军战士建立了密切的联系。海防前线的战士经常收到各地儿童寄去的慰问信和礼品。
    少年儿童们的文娱体育生活也是非常活跃。北京市在今年年初成立了一个少年木板滑冰场，吸引了大量的少年儿童。今年北京、上海、天津等地的少年儿童举行了地方性的和全国性的音乐表演会，有将近二十七万名爱好音乐的少年儿童参加了演出。北京、旅大等地还举办了全市性的少年儿童美术展览。
    新华社三十日讯　北京市少年先锋队的组织在三、四两个月中发展了两万多名队员，现在全市少年先锋队员已近十六万人。
    今年，北京市少年先锋队辅导员第一次代表会议和第三次全国少年儿童工作会议召开以后，北京市少年先锋队的工作有了很大改进。许多过去没有建队的学校，现在建立了少年先锋队组织。东单、西单、南苑等区已消灭了空白点。许多学校还出现了红领巾班，仅西四区就有四十多个红领巾班。
    孩子们入队后，更加活泼、勇敢，要求进步。东单区贤良小学建队后，孩子们学习情绪普遍高涨。三年级的张秀清过去功课只有六、七十分，入队后语文、算术都达到九十分。这个学校里有一个全校闻名的爱打人爱偷东西的孩子，学校建队后，他决心要争取入队，积极改正缺点，现在这孩子对人友好，在路上拾到东西自动送到派出所去。好些学校中过去被认为“顽皮”、“淘气”而不能入队的儿童，在队的教育下入了队，成为好队员。
