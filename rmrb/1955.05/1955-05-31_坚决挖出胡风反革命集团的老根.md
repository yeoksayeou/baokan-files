　　Resolutely Dig Up the Old Roots of the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
　　Jin Yi
    I fully endorse the decision of the Joint Expanded Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. This decision is extremely necessary and timely. After reading the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" published in the "People's Daily" on the 24th, I simply couldn't control my anger. Since liberation, such a tightly organized, broadly spread, all-pervasive, insidious, and ruthless, long-concealed counter-revolutionary clique is rare. In the past, especially before liberation, they deceived and misled many people, and I was one of those deceived. Although I saw his organization of sectarian cliques and his insidious and malicious nature, I thought they were just birds of a feather, and that Hu Feng was merely competitive and assertive; but at least he was a progressive writer, united around the Party; I never imagined that he was truly a gray snake, a wolf in sheep's clothing, a head of a conspiratorial, anti-Party, anti-people, counter-revolutionary clique.
    In 1949, with the victory of the revolution, the broad masses of the people were elated; the writers who had long been persecuted by the reactionaries were even more overjoyed, like children returning to their mother's embrace; only Hu Feng felt
  “shrouded in immense depression,” “wearing shackles,” “existing like a daughter-in-law, constantly afraid of being beaten.” If he were not an enemy of the revolution, an enemy of the people, how could he have such emotions? It was precisely because he had always been our enemy, insisting on an anti-Party, anti-people, counter-revolutionary stance, that he so viciously regarded Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as a "totem," and was “bound to be wary of public servants.” But on the surface, he still pretended to be hidden, which was his unavoidable bitterness, because "now we are not dealing with 'enemies,' but with 'leaders'!" It is not even worthy to say that he is wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, he is wearing the hundred-year-old coat of Marxism-Leninism, piecing it together and taking it out of context; it can be seen from the 51st letter in the second batch of materials, how he instructed his group members to collect Marxism-Leninism materials, in order to counterattack comrades Lin Mohan and He Qifang, and oppose Marxism-Leninism. He did this, just as he wanted Geng Yong to do (Second Batch of Materials 44), "to stand firm on 'position' in terms of 'literal meaning'." Standing firm on a revolutionary position only in words is just to deceive people, and in his bones he always adheres to a counter-revolutionary position.
    He also understood that a minority of people cannot succeed, so he constantly developed his counter-revolutionary clique. He had a battlefield that he could directly command! Originally, in his letter to Shu Wu on March 15, 1950, he said: "The Shanghai literary scene is being galloped by several fierce men, and it is impossible for us to publish books and periodicals." But later he had the "Mud Society," and also the "New Literature Publishing House" organized for him by Xue Wei, not only arranging Zhang Zhongxiao, Luo Luo, Geng Yong and others, but also publishing a large number of bad books by the Hu Feng clique, and even printing "Courting" by Lu Ling, which praised American soldiers and called the number one war criminal Chiang Kai-shek a traitorous committeeman. In addition, at Fudan University, there was Jia Zhifang, who used various methods to paralyze and poison young people and establish his "prestige." Even the East China Cultural Bureau and the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China had members of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique lurking within. In Beijing, the tentacles of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique extended to the periphery of Premier Zhou. He really used the "Sun Wukong drilling into the belly tactics," constantly drilling into the hearts of the people, inquiring about information, informing and reporting, stealing Party documents, and colluding with each other, which is really infuriating to think about. Moreover, he also "instructed" his anti-Party clique members: "Now is still, it is precisely the time when we need to fight bit by bit, and we must abide by organizational principles, but organizational principles are to ensure the struggle. We must face reality and cherish our strength; otherwise, one step back will lead to ten steps back, and ten steps back will completely become a shadow. Today is the time to strive for a turning point, and there must not be any unnecessary casualties." Who to "struggle" against? What "organizational principles" to abide by? What "struggle" to ensure? What "reality" to face? Whose "strength" to cherish? Not being able to "take a step back" and "not having any unnecessary casualties," how stubbornly he adhered to his counter-revolutionary struggle, how much he "cherished" their counter-revolutionary strength! As for himself? "I am sharpening my sword, observing the direction, and when I am sure, I am willing to cut off my head and throw it out to shatter that dirty, smelly iron wall." He gritted his teeth and expressed his "determination" to sacrifice everything, he really wanted to "coexist and die with the position"!
    But Hu Feng did not only engage in his counter-revolutionary activities on a momentary impulse, he constantly tried his best to plan for his anti-Party clique members on how to deceive the Party and attack the Party. He detailed how to arrange for Lu Ling to deceive Comrade Liao Chengzhi, the former director of the China Youth Art Theater (Second Batch of Materials 46); how to deal with Comrade Zhou Yang with a "soft package hard" attitude, "not to attack casually, nor to retreat a step casually" (Second Batch of Materials 49); how to ask Luo Luo and Zhang Zhongxiao to deal with Wang Yuanhua, who had already realized his mistakes, to both "struggle" and surround and "win over" (Second Batch of Materials 28); how to tirelessly plan for Luyuan on how to muddle through (Materials 25, 27); how to meticulously arrange for the publication of Geng Yong's "Study of The True Story of Ah Q" (Materials 31), in order to "make them know that the world is not easy to be 'peaceful'," and "stimulate them to become even more crazy." It is not enough to say that he is a dog-headed military advisor, he is the Tongtian Sect Leader, the leader of evil forces, the head of a counter-revolutionary clique, and he has always sincerely wanted the people's world to be not so peaceful.
    Even after the attack failed, he was still arranging how to retreat to preserve his strength, in order to "seek rebirth in endurance, everything is for the cause, for a more distant future."
    Hu Feng, don't dream, we honestly tell you: counter-revolutionary regimes will never be reborn, your counter-revolutionary cause has become a shadow, you have no future at all, and you will show your true colors in front of the people and be punished!
    Who is supporting Hu Feng behind the scenes to attack the Party with long-term impunity? What is Hu Feng's political background? We must dig up the old roots of the Hu Feng anti-Party, anti-people, counter-revolutionary clique!

　　坚决挖出胡风反革命集团的老根
　　靳以
    我完全拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议对胡风反革命集团的处理。这一处理是非常必要而及时的。看了二十四日“人民日报”发表的“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”，我简直无法控制我的激怒。解放以来，像这样组织严密，方面广阔，无孔不入，阴毒狠辣，长期隐蔽的反革命集团还是少有的。过去，尤其是在解放以前，他们欺骗了蒙蔽了许多人，我也是被蒙蔽的一个。虽然我看到了他组织宗派小集团，为人阴险刻毒，却以为他们不过是臭味相投，胡风个人好胜逞强而已；但至少也算是一个进步的作家，也是团结在党的周围的；没有想到他真是一条灰色蛇，是一个披着羊皮的恶狼，是一个阴谋活动、反党反人民反革命集团的头子。
    一九四九年革命胜利，广大的人民都欢欣鼓舞；长期受反动派迫害的作家们，更是兴高采烈，彷佛又回到母亲怀抱的孩子；只有胡风才感觉到
  “笼罩着绝大的苦闷”，“带上了枷”，“小媳妇一样，经常怕挨打的存在着”。他如果不是革命的敌人，人民的敌人，怎么能产生这样的情绪？实在因为他一直是我们的敌人，坚持反党反人民反革命的立场，无怪他那么恶毒地把毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”当做“图腾”，而对“公家人不能不存戒心”了。但在表面上他还是伪装隐蔽，这是他的不得已的苦衷，因为“现在所对的并不是
  ‘敌人’，而且都是‘领导者’呀！”说他披着马克思列宁主义外衣都不配，他这是披着马克思列宁主义的百岁衣，东拼西凑，断章取义；从第二批材料的第五十一封信中可以看出，他怎样吩咐他的集团分子搜集马克思列宁主义的资料，为的向林默涵、何其芳同志反噬，反对马克思列宁主义。他这样做，正如同他要耿庸做的那样，（第二批材料四四）“为了‘字面’上要站稳‘立场’”。只在字面上站稳革命立场，不过为了欺人，骨子里始终是坚持反革命立场。
    他也懂得少数人是不能成事的，就不断地发展他的反革命集团。他有可以直接指挥的战场！本来在一九五○年三月十五日给舒芜的信中还说：“上海文坛被几个猛人驰骋着，我们出书出刊物都不可能”。可是以后他就有了“泥土社”，还有雪苇为他组织起来的“新文艺出版社”，不但安插了张中晓、罗洛、耿庸之流，还大量地出版了胡风集团分子的坏书，甚至于歌颂美帝士兵、称第一号战犯蒋介石卖国贼为委员长的路翎的“求爱”也印出了。此外，在复旦大学，有了贾植芳，他用种种办法麻痹毒害青年，建立他的“威信”。就是华东文化局和中共上海市委宣传部也曾有胡风反党集团分子潜伏其间。在北京，胡风反党集团的触角一直伸到了周总理的周围。他真是用“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，一直往人民的心脏钻，探听情况，通风报信，偷盗党内文件，狼狈为奸，想起来真使人愤慨。而且他还向他的反党集团分子“指示”：“现在还是，正是需要点滴斗争的时候，要遵守组织原则，但组织原则是为了保证斗争的。要正视现实，爱惜力量；否则，退一步就得退十步，退十步就非完全成为影子不止。今天正在争取转机之中，不能有一点不必要的伤亡。”向谁“斗争”？遵守什么“组织原则”？保证什么“斗争”？正视什么“现实”？爱惜谁的
  “力量”？不能“退一步”也“不能有一点不必要的伤亡”，多么顽强地坚持他这反革命的斗争，多么“爱惜”他们的反革命的力量！他自己呢？“我在磨我的剑，窥测方向，到我看准了的时候，我愿意割下我的头颅抛掷出去，把那个脏臭的铁壁击碎的。”他咬牙切齿地表示他不惜牺牲一切的“决心”，他真是要“与阵地共存亡”了！
    但胡风并不只凭一时冲动来从事他的反革命活动的，他经常千方百计地，为他的反党集团分子策划如何欺骗党进攻党。他详细布置路翎如何欺骗前中国青年艺术剧院院长廖承志同志（第二批材料四十六）；怎样以“软包硬”的态度对付周扬同志，
  “不能随便攻，也不能随便退一步”（第二批材料四九）；怎样要罗洛、张中晓对付已经认识到自己错误的王元化，既要“斗争”，又要包围“争取”（第二批材料二八）；怎样不惮其烦地为绿原计划如何蒙混过关（材料二五、二七）；怎样周密地为耿庸安排“阿Q正传研究”的出版（材料三一），为了“使他们知道天下不容易‘太平’”，“刺激得他们更疯狂起来”。说他是狗头军师都不够，他是通天教主，是恶势力的首领，是反革命集团的头子，他一直诚心诚意要人民的天下不太平的。
    甚至于在进攻失败以后，他还在布置怎样退却以保存实力，以求“在忍受中求得重生，一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来”。
    胡风，你不要梦想了，我们老实告诉你：反革命政权是永不得重生的，你的反革命事业成为影子了，你没有一点未来，眼前就原形毕露，就要在人民的面前受到惩罚！
    谁在幕后支持着胡风长期的有恃无恐地向党进攻？胡风的政治背景是什么？我们一定要挖出胡风反党反人民反革命集团的老根！
