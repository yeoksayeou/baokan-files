Attention Should Be Paid to the Education and Training of Demobilized Soldiers
Zhang Chong

Our country has the responsibility to properly resettle demobilized soldiers, ensuring they have jobs and food. It also has the responsibility to continuously train and educate them after resettlement, constantly improving their political and cultural level and professional skills, so that all employed demobilized soldiers can fully be competent in their work and play a greater role in the country's socialist construction.

Many units have done very well in the training and education of demobilized soldiers. For example, the Instrument Museum of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Changchun City has recruited more than 70 demobilized soldiers to work from November 1952 to April this year. Most of these demobilized soldiers initially had low levels of education and lacked scientific knowledge. In order to enable them to quickly become familiar with their jobs and technologies, the museum administration organized them to participate in spare-time cultural schools, specializing in physics, chemistry and other courses. In daily work, they also designated specialists to train and educate them through apprenticeship and guaranteed teaching methods. With the care of the leaders and the enthusiastic help of the comrades, coupled with the demobilized soldiers' own hard work, they have made rapid progress. Some of the demobilized soldiers have now assumed important positions, and some have become advanced workers.

The state-owned Dalian Shipbuilding Company also attaches great importance to the training and education of demobilized soldiers. The company has designated specialists to train the professional skills of demobilized soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers who have joined the workforce, providing education in technical theory and practical operation. Xu Yuanmao, a workshop director at the shipyard, trained ten demobilized soldiers in 1954, all of whom became qualified technical workers meeting the standard grades four months ahead of schedule.

However, many units do not pay attention to training and education after they have recruited demobilized soldiers to work, or even ignore them altogether, leaving them to their own devices. This makes it impossible for demobilized soldiers to improve politically, culturally, and professionally for a long time, or their progress is very slow. This causes distress to demobilized soldiers and also brings intangible losses to the work. Some units are even worse, not only failing to train and educate demobilized soldiers, but even using various pretexts, such as "difficult to lead" or "not good at business," to arbitrarily dismiss and fire them. Zhang Ruxian, the head of the personnel section of a cement plant under the Construction Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, has arbitrarily dismissed many demobilized soldiers. This phenomenon is absolutely not allowed.

Generally speaking, demobilized soldiers have a high degree of political awareness and enthusiasm to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, and therefore can actively study their professions and accept training and education. This is a good political condition they possess. All units that recruit demobilized soldiers should make full use of this condition, pay attention to the training of demobilized soldiers, provide them with various convenient conditions, and continuously improve their professional skills so that they can work better for the construction of the motherland with skilled skills.

　　对复员军人要注意教育培养
　　张重
    我们国家有责任妥善安置复员军人，使他们有工作，有饭吃；同时也有责任在把他们安置以后不断地对他们进行培养和教育，不断地提高他们的政治文化水平和业务能力，使所有就业的复员军人能够充分胜任自己的工作，在国家的社会主义建设事业中发挥更大的作用。
    在培养和教育复员军人方面，有不少单位是做得很好的。比如长春市中国科学院仪器馆，从一九五二年十一月到今年四月，前后共吸收七十多名复员军人参加工作。这些复员军人最初大都是文化水平较低，缺乏科学知识。为了使他们很快熟悉业务和技术，仪器馆行政方面组织他们参加了业余文化学校，专门学习物理、化学等课程。在日常工作中还指定专人用带徒弟和包教包学的办法，来培养和教育。领导者的关心和同志们的热情帮助，加上复员军人自己的刻苦钻研，结果他们进步都很快。现在有的复员军人已经担任了重要的职务，有的成了先进工作者。
    国营大连造船公司也很重视对复员军人的培养和教育。公司曾指定专人培养参加工作的复员军人和革命残废军人的业务能力，进行技术理论和实际操作的教育。造船厂工段长徐元茂在一九五四年培养的十名复员军人，都已经提前四个月成为合乎标准等级的技术工人。
    但是也有不少单位在吸收复员军人参加工作之后，不注意培养和教育，甚至不加过问，听之任之。这样就使复员军人长时期在政治上、文化上和业务上都不能提高，或者进步很慢。这给复员军人造成了苦恼，同时也给工作带来无形的损失。有的单位更加恶劣，不但不培养和教育复员军人，甚至假借各种名义，如“不好领导”、“业务上不行”，等等，随意加以开除，解雇。重工业部建筑工程局所属某水泥厂人事科长张汝贤，就曾擅自开除复员军人多名。这种现象是绝对不能容许的。
    一般地说，复员军人有较高的政治觉悟，有积极参加祖国社会主义建设的热情，因而也就能够积极钻研业务，接受培养和教育。这是他们本身所具有的良好的政治条件。一切吸收复员军人参加工作的单位都应该充分利用这种条件，重视对复员军人的培养，给他们以各种便利条件，不断地提高他们的业务能力，使他们能够以熟练的技能更好地为祖国的建设而工作。
