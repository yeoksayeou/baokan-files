Issues Notice Regarding Enrollment Work for Secondary Specialized Schools

Xinhua News Agency

The Ministry of Higher Education issued a notice on the 17th regarding the enrollment work for secondary specialized schools in 1955, and simultaneously announced the enrollment methods for secondary specialized schools.

The notice pointed out that improving the quality of new students entering secondary specialized schools is an important condition for training intermediate professional cadres for the country. In order to ensure the admission of qualified new students and better accommodate the wishes of candidates, this year's enrollment work for secondary specialized schools will adopt the method of independent enrollment by the schools themselves (secondary specialized schools in the same region or of the same nature can also organize joint enrollment). The examination areas and times for secondary specialized school enrollment should be determined in accordance with the unified arrangements of the local secondary school enrollment committees. If a school needs to enroll students in other provinces (cities), the school should consult with the relevant provincial (municipal) education departments (bureaus) in advance to determine this. In order to facilitate candidates' systematic preparation of lessons and ensure the quality of new students, the Ministry of Higher Education has formulated an outline for the entrance examination of secondary specialized schools. The enrollment examinations of each school should be based on the scope stipulated in the outline; however, the depth and breadth of the questions should be combined with the actual level of local junior middle school graduates. Each school should contact relevant local departments to do a good job in publicizing and educating candidates on further education guidance, to ensure the completion of the enrollment plan.

The enrollment methods for secondary specialized schools stipulate that the application conditions are: Any citizen of the People's Republic of China who has graduated from junior middle school or has equivalent academic ability, and is between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five, may apply. The admission age for worker-peasant cadres, industrial workers, and ethnic minority students may be relaxed to thirty years old; the admission age for demobilized and transferred soldiers, graduates of schools for revolutionary disabled soldiers, and returned overseas Chinese students may be relaxed to thirty years old. The examination subjects are: Basic knowledge of the Chinese Revolution, Chinese language, and mathematics. Those who apply for architecture, art schools should take an additional drawing test; those who apply for sports, music, drama and other schools should add examination items according to their professional nature. Descendants of martyrs, children of military personnel, industrial workers, revolutionary work cadres, young peasants, children of workers and peasants, and ethnic minorities, whose test scores are equal to those of other students, will be given priority in admission. Demobilized and transferred soldiers, graduates of schools for revolutionary disabled soldiers, and returned overseas Chinese students also enjoy the above-mentioned preferential treatment. When applying, candidates should select the school and major of their choice based on the needs of the country's comprehensive construction and their own specific conditions. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　高等教育部在十七日发出关于一九五五年中等专业学校招生工作的通知，同时公布了中等专业学校招生办法。
    通知指出，提高中等专业学校入学新生的质量，是达到为国家培养中级专业干部的重要条件。为了保证录取合格的新生，更好地照顾考生志愿，今年中等专业学校学生招生工作，采取由学校自行单独招生的办法（同一地区或同性质的中等专业学校亦可组织联合招生）。中等专业学校招生考试地区和考试时间，应按照当地中等学校招生委员会的统一布置来确定。如学校须在外地招生者，由学校事先与有关省（市）教育厅（局）洽商确定。为了便于考生有系统地准备功课，保证新生质量，高等教育部制定了中等专业学校招生考试大纲。各校招生考试应根据大纲所规定的范围命题；但其命题的深度、广度，应结合当地初级中学毕业生的实际水平。各校应与当地有关部门取得联系，做好考生升学指导的宣传教育工作，以保证完成招生计划。
    中等专业学校招生办法规定报考条件为：凡在初级中学毕业或具有同等学力，年龄从十五周岁到二十五周岁的中华人民共和国人民，都可报考。工农干部、产业工人和少数民族学生的入学年龄，可放宽到三十周岁；复员转业军人、革命残废军人学校毕业生与归国华侨学生的入学年可放宽到三十周岁。考试科目为：中国革命常识、中国语文和数学。凡投考建筑艺术和美术学校者，应加考图画；投考体育、音乐、戏剧等学校者，应按其专业性质增加考试项目。凡烈属、军属子女、产业工人、革命工作干部、青年农民、工农子女、少数民族，其投考成绩与其他学生同等者，将优先录取。复员转业军人、革命残废军人学校毕业生、归国华侨学生，也享受上述优待。考生报考时，应根据国家全面建设的需要与本人具体条件，选择报考志愿的学校和专业。（新华社）
