　　Strengthen Storm Defense Work in Coastal Fishing Areas
　　Zhang Zhendong
　　Since the spring fishing season of 1954, coastal fishing areas have repeatedly experienced accidents involving fishermen's deaths due to wind disasters. The phenomenon of fishermen's deaths due to wind disasters is particularly serious in the four provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Shandong. Not long after the start of the spring fishing season this year, these coastal areas have again experienced continuous wind disasters, resulting in significant losses. In the disaster-stricken areas, fishermen's enthusiasm for production has been affected, and the production and lives of the families of the victims have become very difficult. This issue must attract the deep attention of the Party and government leading organs in coastal fishing areas.
　　The reasons for the continuous occurrence of serious wind disaster accidents during the spring fishing season are mainly due to some problems in the storm defense work in coastal fishing areas. The departments leading production in coastal fishing areas and the fishermen believe that there are no typhoons in the spring season, and the danger of going to sea for fishing is not high, so they are not alert to general strong winds; at the same time, the spring fishing season is also the peak season for marine production, and the production tasks are heavy. Some leading organs only emphasize completing production tasks and ignore safety. Some coastal fishing areas have relaxed their leadership over storm warning work, and some warning personnel are not dedicated to their work and lack a sense of responsibility. In the wind disasters of last year and this year, there have been phenomena of accidents repeatedly caused by dereliction of duty by storm warning personnel or district and township cadres. Some areas have not seriously summarized the experience of preventing wind disasters, learned lessons, and carried out widespread and in-depth publicity and education among the masses. They have not persuasively educated and corrected the fishermen's blind belief in narrow experience, adventurous actions, and muddled ideas of relying on the heavens.
　　Of course, there are indeed some practical difficulties in the technical aspect of storm warning work, such as sometimes the forecasts are not accurate and timely enough; the coastal warning signals cannot be transmitted to the offshore areas, and there is a lack of radio receiving equipment on the fishing grounds, so fishing boats cannot get the message and quickly return to port before strong winds strike. However, it must be pointed out that many maritime accidents can be avoided or mitigated by strengthening subjective efforts.
　　At present, it is the peak season for marine fisheries production, and all localities should immediately take effective measures to strengthen storm defense work in coastal fishing areas.
　　First of all, the leading organs of fishing areas should overcome the idea of simply emphasizing production and ignoring safety work, strengthen the specific arrangements and inspections of storm warning work during the fishing season, establish a warning transmission network with the warning station or district and township fishing season leading departments as the center, and organize the radios of all relevant institutions in the fishing area to serve the safety of production during the fishing season, designate special personnel to be responsible for radio reception, and formulate necessary work contact and inspection systems.
　　Secondly, it is necessary to seize the gaps in spring fishing season production to conduct ship inspections or key spot checks, supervise the repair of dilapidated fishing boats and equipment. Before going to sea, temporarily organize the boats in the same port to take care of each other, and strive to have at least one fishing boat carrying a radio on the same operating sea area. According to the "Instructions on Establishing Radio Stations in Key Agricultural, Animal Husbandry, and Fishery Production Cooperatives" issued by the State Council on March 29, coastal fishing areas can establish mobile marine radio stations and entrust the management of radios to certain production units.
　　Thirdly, it is necessary to respect the nautical experience of old fishermen and exchange safe operating experience created in various places. All localities should adopt methods such as large boats leading small boats, new boats leading old boats, and experienced fishermen cooperating with less experienced fishermen to ensure production safety.
　　In order to improve the professional level and political awareness of storm warning personnel, the personnel of warning stations, fishery cooperatives, and district and township cadres who are responsible for radio reception should be regularly trained. Coastal fishing areas can sign contracts with meteorological observatories and stations for specific requirements for weather forecasts, such as the wind force level that needs to be forecast, the number of forecasts, and contact methods.
　　During the fishing season, it is also necessary to be prepared for rescue work after wind disasters occur. In many wind disasters, naval vessels have played a huge role in rescuing the lives and property of fishermen, greatly reducing the losses of fishermen. The leading organs of each fishing area should further maintain regular close contact with the navy, aquatic product companies, and navigation departments to seek their assistance.

　　加强沿海渔区的暴风防御工作
　　张震东
    沿海渔区自一九五四年春汛以后，就屡次因风灾发生渔民死亡的事故，浙江、福建、广东和山东四省因风灾发生渔民死亡事故的现象尤为严重。今年春汛开始不久，这几个省沿海地区又连续发生风灾，造成了很大的损失。在受灾地区，渔民的生产积极性受到影响，同时被难渔民家属的生产和生活发生了很大困难。这个问题必须引起沿海渔区党政领导机关的深切注意。
    春汛中不断发生严重风灾事故的原因，主要是沿海渔区在暴风防御工作上还存在一些问题。沿海渔区领导生产的各部门和渔民以为春季没有台风，出海捕鱼危险不大，因而对一般大风不加警惕；同时春汛又是海洋生产的旺汛，生产任务大，有些领导机关只强调完成生产任务，忽视了安全。有些沿海渔区对暴风警报工作放松了领导，有的警报人员不安心工作，责任感不强。在去年和今年的风灾中，都有由于暴风警报人员或区、乡干部失职一再造成事故的现象。有些地区没有认真地总结防御风灾的经验，接受教训，并在群众中展开普遍深入的宣传教育，对渔民中存在的盲目相信狭隘经验、冒险行动和迷信靠天的糊涂思想，没有进行说服教育，给以纠正。
    当然，暴风警报工作在技术上也确有一些实际困难，例如有时发布预报不够准确和及时；海岸警报信号不能向远海传达，渔场上又缺少收音设备，因而在大风来袭以前渔船无法获得消息，迅速返港。但是，必须指出，很多海上事故只要加强主观努力是可以避免或减轻的。
    目前正是海洋渔业生产的旺节，各地应立即采取有效措施，加强沿海渔区的暴风防御工作。
    首先，渔区领导机关应克服单纯强调生产、忽视安全工作的思想，加强对渔汛期间暴风警报工作的具体布置和检查，以警报站或区、乡渔汛领导部门为中心，建立分区负责的警报传递网，并将渔区各有关机构的收音机组织起来为汛期生产安全服务，指定专人负责收音工作，制定必要的工作联系和检查制度。
    其次，要抓紧在春汛生产空隙进行船体检查或重点抽查，监督修补破旧渔船和船具。出海前将同港船只适当地加以临时编组，以便互相照应，争取作到同一作业海面上至少有一只携带收音机的渔船。根据国务院三月二十九日发布的“关于在农业、畜牧业、渔业生产合作社重点建立收音站的指示”精神，各沿海渔区可以建立海上流动收音站，将收音机委托一定的生产单位管理。
    再次，要尊重老渔民的航海经验和交流各地创造的安全作业经验。各地应采取大船带小船，新船带旧船，有经验的渔民配合经验少的渔民等办法，来保证生产安全。
    为了提高暴风警报人员的业务水平和政治觉悟，应对警报站人员、渔业社和区乡干部中担任收音工作的人员定期进行训练。各沿海渔区对天气预报的具体要求，如需要预报的风力等级、预报次数、联系办法等，可以向气象台、站商订合同。
    在渔汛期间还要时刻准备风灾发生后的抢救工作。在多次风灾中，海军舰艇在抢救渔民生命财产方面起了巨大的作用，大大减轻了渔民的损失，各渔区领导机关应进一步同海军、水产公司、航务部门保持经常的密切的联系，争取它们的帮助。
