On International Labor Day, a grand military parade was held on Red Square in Moscow.

Today, the entire city of Moscow is filled with a festive atmosphere. Red Square, next to the Kremlin, is decorated more beautifully than usual. On the building opposite the Kremlin hang portraits of Lenin and Stalin and the national emblems of the sixteen Soviet republics. The Soviet flag and slogans from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union celebrating May Day are hung on the tall buildings around Red Square. Troops participating in the review are lined up on Red Square and on the streets leading to Red Square.

Representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, ministers of various ministries, scientists, literary and artistic workers, and advanced industrial and agricultural workers are standing on the reviewing stand. Also on the reviewing stand are trade union delegations and worker delegations from various countries who have come to Moscow for the celebrations, as well as foreign diplomatic envoys and military attachés stationed in the Soviet Union.

As it approached ten o'clock, the leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Pervukhin, Saburov, Khrushchev, the Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Pospelov, Suslov, and Soviet Marshals and Generals ascended the reviewing platform on Lenin and Stalin's Mausoleum. They were warmly welcomed by the people in Red Square.

At exactly 10:00 a.m., the parade began. The Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Soviet Union Zhukov, drove out of the Spassky Tower gate. Accompanied by the Commander of the Parade, Marshal of the Soviet Union Moskalenko, he inspected the troops and extended festive greetings to them. After the inspection, Zhukov ascended the reviewing platform and delivered a speech.

Zhukov said: Today, the working class and working people of all countries are demonstrating fraternal unity, closely uniting their ranks, and fighting for peace and the security of all peoples, against imperialist oppression and colonial enslavement, and for freedom and national independence. The Soviet people resolutely implement the resolutions of our Party, devote all their strength to the noble cause of building a communist society, and constantly achieve new successes in further developing various sectors of industry and agriculture, as well as science and culture. The Soviet people unanimously support the Communist Party's general line of giving priority to the development of heavy industry.

Speaking of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, Zhukov said: The friendship between the Soviet Union, great China, the people's democratic countries, and the people of the German Democratic Republic is growing stronger and developing. The Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy is increasingly enhancing the Soviet Union's international prestige. Zhukov said that the ratification of the Paris Agreements hinders the relaxation of international tensions and requires the Soviet people to take new measures to ensure security and safeguard world peace.

Zhukov continued: The Soviet people will do everything possible to ensure that all sectors of the national economy reach a new and powerful high, achieve technological progress, and make due contributions to the cause of further strengthening the power of the motherland and to the cause of communist construction. The powerful Soviet armed forces, equipped with the latest weapons and combat technology, are capable of crushing any enemy group that attempts to undermine the peaceful labor of the Soviet people. The Soviet people can be confident that their army and navy will spare no effort to further improve combat training, improve combat readiness, and successfully master the latest equipment. After Zhukov's speech, cheers rang out in Red Square. The Soviet national anthem and celebratory gun salutes sounded in unison.

The march-past began. Leading the way were students from various military academies. Many of them wore the Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union, Orders of Valor, and medals. Students from the Frunze Military Academy, the Lenin Military Political Academy, the Artillery Academy, and other academies marched across Red Square in strict formation.

The naval contingent received universal praise. Behind them were students from the Supreme Military School of the Russian Federation, and students from the Suvorov and Nakhimov Naval Schools.

Soldiers of the Guards Taman Infantry Division passed through Red Square in armored personnel carriers. Next, artillery units passed through Red Square, with powerful tractors towing various types of artillery. Behind the anti-aircraft guns and the Guards artillery units known to everyone as "Katyusha" were large-caliber cannons.

The parade lasted only a short time, but it convincingly demonstrated the power of the Soviet armed forces defending peaceful labor.

After the military parade, sports teams passed through Red Square. They formed a colorful contingent symbolizing the friendship of all the nationalities of the Soviet Union. They performed various gymnastics, and Red Square presented a very beautiful scene.

After the sports teams passed, the parade of the working people of Moscow, which was originally scheduled to take place, was cancelled due to bad weather.

    莫斯科“五一”节举行盛大阅兵
    在“五一”国际劳动节，莫斯科红场上举行了盛大的阅兵。
    今天，莫斯科全市呈现一片节日气象。克里姆林宫旁的红场打扮得比平日更加漂亮了。在克里姆林宫对面的大厦上挂着列宁和斯大林的画像和苏联十六个加盟共和国的国徽。红场四周的高大建筑物上挂着苏联国旗和苏联共产党中央委员会庆祝“五一”节的口号。红场上和通往红场的各条街道上排列着参加检阅的部队。
    观礼台上站着苏联最高苏维埃和俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃的代表、各部部长、科学工作者、文学和艺术工作者、先进的工农业劳动者。观礼台上还站着来莫斯科观礼的各国工会代表团和工人代表团以及各国驻苏联的外交使节和武官。
    快到十点钟的时候，苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导人布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛、萨布罗夫、赫鲁晓夫，苏联共产党中央委员会书记波斯伯洛夫、苏斯洛夫，苏联元帅和将军们登上列宁斯大林陵墓上的检阅台。他们受到了红场上的人们的热烈欢迎。
    上午十时正，阅兵式开始。苏联国防部长、苏联元帅朱可夫乘车驶出了斯巴斯基塔的大门。他由阅兵总指挥、苏联元帅莫斯卡连科陪同，检阅了部队，并向部队致节日的祝贺。检阅后，朱可夫登上检阅台，发表了演说。
    朱可夫说：今天，各国的工人阶级、劳动人民，显示出兄弟般的团结，紧密团结自己的队伍，为争取和平和各国人民的安全、为反对帝国主义的压迫和殖民奴役、为争取自由和民族独立而斗争。苏联人民坚决贯彻我们党的决议，以全部力量致力于建设共产主义社会的崇高事业，在进一步发展工农业各部门和科学、文化方面不断取得新的成就。苏联人民一致支持共产党优先发展重工业的总路线。
    朱可夫在谈到苏联的和平外交政策时说：苏联、伟大的中国、各人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国人民的友谊在日益加强和发展。苏联的和平外交政策正在日益加强苏联的国际威望。朱可夫说：巴黎协定的批准阻碍着国际紧张局势的缓和，并且要求苏联人民采取新的措施以保障安全和维护世界和平。
    朱可夫接着说：苏联人民将竭尽全力以保证国民经济的一切部门达到新的强大的高涨，取得技术上的进步，并将对进一步加强祖国的威力的事业，对共产主义建设事业作出应有的贡献。以最新式的武器和作战技术装备起来的强大的苏联武装力量，能够粉碎企图破坏苏联人民的和平劳动的任何敌人集团。苏联人民可以相信，他们的陆海军将不遗余力地来进一步改进作战训练、提高战斗准备，并成功地掌握最新式的装备。朱可夫演说结束后，红场上响起了一片欢呼声。苏联国歌和礼炮声齐鸣。
    分列式开始。走在前面的是各军事学院的学员。他们中间有许多人佩戴着苏联英雄的金星、战功勋章和奖章。伏龙芝军事学院、列宁军政学院、炮兵学院和其他学院的学生以严整的队形走过红场。
    海军的队伍受到了普遍的赞扬。他们后面就是俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃军事学校的学生、苏沃洛夫和纳希莫夫军事学校的学生们。
    近卫军塔曼步兵师的士兵坐在装甲运兵车上通过红场。接着，炮队又经过了红场，强大的牵引车拖着各种各样的大炮。在高射炮和以“喀秋莎”而为大家所熟知的近卫军炮队后面是大口径的大炮。
    阅兵进行了不多久，但是它却令人信服地显示了捍卫和平劳动的苏联武装部队的威力。
    阅兵结束后，体育大队通过红场。他们组成一支象征着苏联各族人民友谊的色彩绚丽的队伍。他们表演了各种体操，红场上呈现出非常美丽的景象。
    体育大队走过后，原定举行的莫斯科劳动人民的游行，因天气不好而未举行。
