　　Material Exchange Fairs Universally Held in Various Parts of Guizhou

According to incomplete statistics, over 800 material exchange fairs were held in various parts of Guizhou Province from January to April, with a total transaction value of more than 10.6 million yuan. At the material exchange fairs, approximately 300,000 pieces of iron, bamboo, and wooden farm tools (including some new-style farm tools), over 6,000 head of cattle, and a large amount of cake fertilizer, phosphate rock powder, and some insecticides and chemical fertilizers were supplied to farmers of various ethnic groups. In Wangmo and Ceheng counties, where the Buyi ethnic group lives, more than 20 material exchange fairs were held successively from February to April. At the fairs, farmers sold local products such as brown sugar, Tian Dong (Asparagus Root), and Phellodendron bark to supply and marketing cooperatives, and at the same time bought back a large number of farm tools and a considerable number of cattle. In Dading County, where Han, Yi, and Miao ethnic groups live together, small-scale material exchange fairs were held successively to serve spring plowing and production, which were very popular among farmers. At the material exchange fair in Yeba Township, District 6, on March 21, farmers of various ethnic groups bought more than 50,000 jin of oil cake and more than 500 farm tools from the supply and marketing cooperative. Many farmers also put forward suggestions to the staff of the supply and marketing cooperative on improving the quality of certain farm tools. In the Zunyi area, more than 3,000 head of cattle were transferred through material exchange fairs in February and March.
