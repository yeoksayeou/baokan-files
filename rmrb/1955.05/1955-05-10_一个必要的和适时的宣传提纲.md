    A Necessary and Timely Propaganda Outline
　　Kong Sang
    The Propaganda Department of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently published a "Propaganda Outline on Supporting the Exploration and Development of the Qaidam Basin" in the Qinghai Daily. It requires all Party members, League members, cadres, and activists in Qinghai Province to use their mouths, hands, and brains to think of ways to complete their work tasks 100%, and to carry out in-depth propaganda to the surrounding masses so that everyone can recognize the importance of exploring and developing the Qaidam Basin and help the exploration and development personnel successfully complete their tasks.
    Explaining the country's tasks to the broad masses and carrying out work with their help is the basic method for the success of all our political and economic work. This propaganda work is especially important in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities. Therefore, the propaganda outline issued by the Propaganda Department of the Qinghai Provincial Committee is absolutely necessary and timely. Today, not only should the inland provinces issue calls to the broad masses of people based on their specific tasks, mobilizing them to actively participate in and support various construction undertakings, but also other provinces across the country should mobilize their financial, material, and human resources to actively support inland construction.
    We often say that the motherland is great and that the motherland's economic construction has made great progress. We have surpassed the decades of rule by the Kuomintang reactionaries in five years. These are all facts, beyond doubt. However, judging from the current situation, whether it is industry or agriculture, it is mainly concentrated in the coastal provinces. The industrial and agricultural production of these provinces will certainly continue to develop in the future, but we must never think that relying solely on the existing foundation is enough to build our motherland even greater. If we want to produce more steel, we must find more iron ore; if we want to produce more grain, we must reclaim more wasteland. In short, for a better tomorrow, we must vigorously develop the vast and rich inland areas. This is an important guarantee for the rapid development of the national economy.
    Our motherland's inland areas have extremely good conditions for developing industrial and agricultural production. Take the Qaidam Basin as an example, and look at the introduction in that propaganda outline: The Qaidam Basin is a treasure basin, with an area of 220,000 square kilometers. It contains rich oil and other metal mineral deposits, and has more than 30 million mu of reclaimable wasteland, which is five times the area of cultivated land in Qinghai Province. Last year, the state-owned Delingha Farm in the Qaidam Basin had a wheat yield of more than 800 jin per mu, and the general average was also 300 jin. Reclaiming the wasteland of the Qaidam Basin would yield enough grain each year for the current population of Qinghai to eat for more than ten years. And the Qaidam Basin is just one of the countless resource-rich regions in the interior.
    Of course, there are many difficulties in developing the inland areas, and it is a long-term task. But as long as we explain the principles clearly, we can mobilize the strength of the entire people to overcome these difficulties. Weren't there many difficulties in building the Kangzang Highway? Now it is finally open to traffic. Wasn't the Yangtze River flood last year very large? The people finally overcame it. To build socialism, we must have the courage to fear neither heaven nor earth. Therefore, we must strengthen the propaganda for the construction of the motherland's inland areas, mobilize engineering and technical personnel and urban and rural people to actively support the inland construction from all aspects, and ensure that the manpower, financial resources, and materials they need can be continuously supplied!

    一个必要的和适时的宣传提纲
　　孔桑
    中共青海省委宣传部最近在青海日报上发表了一个“关于支援勘察开发柴达木盆地的宣传提纲”，其中要求青海全省党员、团员、干部和群众中的积极分子，动嘴动手，用脑筋想办法，百分之百地完成自己的工作任务，并向周围群众进行深入的宣传，使大家都能认识到勘察和开发柴达木盆地的重要意义，帮助勘察开发人员胜利完成任务。
    向广大群众说明国家的任务，在取得他们的帮助下进行工作，这是我们一切政治工作和经济工作成功的基本方法。特别是在少数民族聚居的地方，这种宣传工作就更其重要。因此，青海省委宣传部发出的这个宣传提纲，是完全必要的和适时的。今天，不只是内地各省都应该根据本省的具体任务，向广大人民群众发出号召，动员他们积极参加和支援各项建设事业，就是在全国其它省份，也应该动员本省的财力、物力、人力，积极支援内地建设。
    我们经常说，祖国是伟大的，祖国的经济建设有很大的发展，我们用五年的时间就赶过了国民党反动派统治时期的几十年。这些都完全是事实，不容置疑。但是从目前情况来看，不论是工业也好、农业也好，主要还只是集中在沿海各省。这些省份的工农业生产，今后当然还会不断发展，可是我们却决不能以为仅仅依靠现有基础，就足以把我们的祖国建设得更伟大。我们要生产更多的钢铁，就得寻找更多的铁矿；要生产更多的粮食，就得开垦更多的荒地。总之，为了美好的明天，就必须大力开发广大的、富饶的内地。这是国民经济迅速发展的重要保证。
    我们祖国的内地，有发展工农业生产的极其良好的条件。就以柴达木盆地为例，请看看那个宣传提纲的介绍吧：柴达木盆地是一个聚宝盆，面积二十二万平方公里。蕴藏着丰富的石油及其它金属矿藏，有三千多万亩可开垦的荒地，等于青海省已耕地的五倍。柴达木盆地的国营德令哈农场，去年小麦每亩产量高达八百多斤，一般的平均也有三百斤。把柴达木的荒地开垦出来，每年粮食产量足够青海现有人口吃十几年。而柴达木盆地还只是内地无数物产丰富的地区中的一个而已。
    当然，开发内地的困难是很多的，也是一个长期的工作。可是只要我们把道理讲清了，就可以动员全体人民的力量克服这些困难。修建康藏公路的困难不是很多吗？现在终于通车了。去年长江的洪水不是很大吗？人民终于战胜了它。要建设社会主义，就要有天不怕地不怕的气魄。因此，必须加强建设祖国内地的宣传，动员工程技术人员和城乡人民从各方面积极支援内地建设，保证它们所需要的人力财力物力都能得到源源不断的供应！
