Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The State Council has approved the implementation of new freight rates and passenger fares for national railways starting June 1st.

The main aspect of the new railway freight rates is to unify the different freight rates in the Northeast region and the North and South regions, while maintaining the current level of freight rates and reforming the freight rate system. The railway freight rates in the Northeast region were originally about 20% lower on average than those in the North and South. This measure was necessary during the economic recovery period, but it no longer meets the requirements of the national planned economy in the context of large-scale planned economic construction; at the same time, bulk materials are now uniformly allocated or purchased and sold by the state, and unified freight rates are now possible.

This time, the unification of freight rates will be carried out in a differentiated and step-by-step manner. For bulk goods such as coal, grain, timber, and mineral building materials, the freight rates will be unified by leveling the freight rates in the Northeast and the North and South. For example, the freight rate for coal, calculated based on the average transportation mileage, will be reduced by 18.1% in the North and South and increased by 20.8% in the Northeast. Since railway freight rates have a declining rate for longer distances, most freight rates for goods exchanged between the Northeast and the North and South will be lower than before after the freight rates are unified. For example, the freight cost for transporting coal from the Fengfeng Coal Mine to the Beipiao Station in the Northeast will be reduced by about 7%; the freight cost for transporting pig iron from Anshan to Tianjin will be reduced by about 10%. For other goods such as industrial machinery, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn, the method of leveling the freight rates in the Northeast and the North and South will also be adopted. For non-staple foods and local and special products necessary for people's livelihood, such as livestock, meat, eggs, vegetables, fish, shrimp, fresh fruits, medicinal plants, and ceramics, specific reduced freight rates will still be implemented in the Northeast region to maintain the stability of the prices of these goods, considering the people's purchasing power.

While unifying the freight rates between the Northeast and the North and South, the original graded freight rate system will be gradually reformed because it cannot well implement our country's economic policies. In the reformed freight rate system, some major goods will not be priced according to the price of the goods themselves, but will be assigned freight rate numbers according to the production, consumption significance, and transportation conditions of various goods. In addition, the new freight rates also appropriately adjusted some unreasonable phenomena of excessively high or low freight rates for certain goods. For example, the freight rates for industrial materials such as electrical machinery, lubricating oil, asbestos tiles, asphalt felt, tin, nickel, and manganese will be reduced; the freight rates for goods such as tea and tobacco will be slightly increased.

Because there are some unreasonable phenomena in the proportion of railway passenger fares and various ticket prices, which cannot guarantee the transportation costs of the railway and the state's certain accumulation requirements, the national railway has also made appropriate adjustments to passenger fares this time. After the adjustment, the fares for ordinary passenger trains and express trains will increase by 30% compared with the current fares. The freight rates for luggage and ordinary parcels will increase by 20%. The freight rates for fresh parcels and newspapers will increase by 10%. Other sleeper ticket prices and special express ticket prices have been adjusted to varying degrees. In order to take care of the transportation needs of workers, peasants, and students in the suburbs for production and study, suburban passenger train tickets will be reduced by 9% compared with the current tickets, and substitute passenger train tickets will be reduced by 18.8% compared with the current tickets.

### 全国铁路从六月一日起实行新的客货运价

　　全国铁路从六月一日起实行新的客货运价
    新华社十七日讯　国务院已经批准全国铁路从六月一日起实行新的货物运价和旅客运价。
    铁路新的货物运价主要是在保持现行货物运价水平的前提下，对东北地区和北、南方两套不同的运价率实行统一，并改革运价制度。东北地区铁路货物运价原来平均比北、南方低百分之二十左右。这种措施在经济恢复时期原属必要，但在全国规模的有计划的经济建设的情况下，就已经不符合国家计划经济的要求；同时大宗物资已由国家统一调拨或统购统销，统一运价也已具备了条件。
    这次统一运价将采取有区别有步骤的方法进行。对于煤、粮食、木材、矿物性建筑材料等大宗货物的运价，将采取把东北和北、南方货物运价拉平的办法统一起来。例如煤的运价按平均运送里程计算，在北、南方减低了百分之十八点一，在东北增加了百分之二十点八。由于铁路运费有递远递差的办法，运价统一后，东北和北、南方交流的货物大部分运价都将比原来降低。例如自峰峰煤矿运煤到东北北票站，运费约减低百分之七；自鞍山运生铁到天津，运费约减低百分之十。其他如工业机械、棉布、棉纱等，也采取将东北和北、南方运价拉平的办法。对于人民生活必需的副食品和土产特产，如牲畜、肉类、蛋类、蔬菜、鱼虾、鲜水果、植物药材、陶瓷器等，因照顾到人民的购买力，在东北地区仍将实行特定减低的运价办法，以保持这些货物价格的稳定。
    和统一东北和北、南方运价的同时，原来的分等运价制度因为不能很好贯彻我国的经济政策，将逐步加以改革。改革后的运价制度，一些主要货物将不是按照货物本身的价格高低来规定运价，而是按照各种货物的生产、消费意义和运送条件来分设运价号。此外，新运价也适当调整了某些货物运价偏高偏低的不合理现象。如电气机械、润滑油、石棉瓦、柏油毡、锡、镍、锰等工业物资的运价将降低；茶叶、烟叶等货物运价将稍为提高。
    因为铁路旅客运价和各种客票票价比例上存在着某些不合理的现象，不能保证铁路的运输成本和国家一定的积累要求，这次全国铁路对旅客运价也作了适当调整。调整以后，普通旅客列车票价和快车票价将比现行运价增加百分之三十。行李和普通包裹运价将增加百分之二十。鲜货包裹和报纸类运价将增加百分之十。其他卧铺票价、特别快车票价都有不同程度的调整。为了照顾近郊工人、农民和学生生产和学习的乘车，近郊客车票价比现行票价减低百分之九，代用客车票价比现行票价减低百分之十八点八。
