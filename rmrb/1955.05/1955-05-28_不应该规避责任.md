Should Not Evade Responsibility
　　Feng Zhidan
On May 24th, Canadian Minister of External Affairs, Lester Pearson, made a statement in the Canadian Parliament regarding the Vietnam general election, saying, "We do not wish to be responsible for elections that do not give people the opportunity to freely express their opinions. Elections must be free elections, otherwise, we do not wish to have any connection with the election."
According to the Geneva Accords, both sides of Vietnam should negotiate this July regarding the 1956 general election in Vietnam. As this deadline is approaching, it is very perplexing that the Canadian Minister of External Affairs, as a member state of the International Supervisory and Supervisory Commission for Vietnam, would make such a statement that seems to evade its responsibility to supervise the Vietnam election.
Pearson advocates that elections should be free. This is correct. However, this statement is strangely similar to the talks by Dulles and Ngo Dinh Diem, who have always tried their best to undermine the Vietnam general election, regarding this election.
Everyone remembers that Dulles has repeatedly clamored that he would only agree to the Vietnam general election "under free conditions." He also falsely accused that there was no so-called "freedom" in North Vietnam. Under the instigation of the United States, Ngo Dinh Diem also openly demanded "UN supervision of elections," and he also echoed Dulles, saying, "Our government agrees to hold elections, as long as the elections are free." Do these guys who curl their tongues when they speak, in order to make people not understand their true intentions, really want a truly free election?
The truth has long been revealed by American and British journalists. The American "Look" magazine admitted that if a free general election were held, "the vast majority of Vietnamese would vote for the Communists." The London "Times" also said that the residents of South Vietnam "feel that the Viet Minh represents hope." These newspapers, in any sense, cannot be said to be Communist. There are many, many more of this kind of revelation from Western bourgeois newspapers about America's fear of holding free elections in Vietnam.
It is precisely because of this that the United States has painstakingly instructed Ngo Dinh Diem to do its utmost to destroy freedom in South Vietnam and conspire to undermine the free general election in Vietnam. First of all, the United States has tried its best to support and instruct the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to destroy the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the guarantee of democratic freedom rights in South Vietnam, and to carry out large-scale massacres and arrests of the people. According to incomplete statistics, from the ceasefire in 1954 to January of this year, in less than half a year, Ngo Dinh Diem carried out more than 2,300 massacres of the people in South Vietnam, more than 800 people were killed, more than 3,700 people were injured, and more than 13,000 people were arrested. Subsequently, in order to barely gather the number of voters when the general election was inevitable, the United States instructed the French colonialists to use various cruel and deceptive methods to transport residents from North Vietnam and place them under Ngo Dinh Diem's police rule. Now the United States is instructing Ngo Dinh Diem to eliminate dissidents, provoke civil war, and implement a reign of terror in South Vietnam. At the same time, it is instructing the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to announce so-called "election laws" and "prepare" for a one-sided so-called "election" in South Vietnam completely controlled by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. It seems that the United States is copying its practices in South Korea, attempting to use the trick of a one-sided "election" to establish a Syngman Rhee-style regime in South Vietnam, undermine the Geneva Accords, permanently divide Vietnam, and draw the US border on the territory of Vietnam. After visiting Indochina, a reporter for the "Indian Times" said that South Vietnam "is gradually forming a military dictatorship similar to that of South Korea." There, people truly have no opportunity to express their opinions at all.
Yes, a free general election is stipulated by the Geneva Accords, but the United States is undermining this freedom and is also trying to undermine the general election. Dulles and Ngo Dinh Diem clamored that there is no such freedom in North Vietnam, which is nothing more than a prelude to undermining and obstructing the general election. This situation shows that the International Commission, which is responsible for supervising the free general election in Vietnam according to the Geneva Accords, faces an arduous task. In order to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords and to ensure peace in Indochina, this task cannot be evaded. It is clear that Canada's attempt to evade this supervisory responsibility is not in accordance with the Geneva Accords.
In fact, everyone knows that the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have expressed great hatred for all fair efforts of the International Commission. Saigon Radio, reflecting the views of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, openly slandered the Vietnam International Supervisory and Supervisory Commission, saying that it could not supervise the general election in Vietnam. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique even launched a signature campaign, accusing the International Commission of being "incompetent" and demanding that it "dissolve itself automatically." It can be seen from this that if Canada wants to use any excuse to evade its responsibility to supervise the free general election in Vietnam, it will be conducive to the conspiracy of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to undermine the free general election, and it will endanger the full implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam.

### 不应该规避责任

　　不应该规避责任
　　冯之丹
    五月二十四日，加拿大外交部长皮尔逊在加拿大议会里发表关于越南普选的意见说：“我们并不希望对那些丝毫不让人民有机会来自由表达他们的意见的选举负责。选举必须是自由的选举，否则的话，我们不愿意同选举发生任何关系。”
    照日内瓦协议的规定，越南双方应该在今年七月就一九五六年在越南全国普选，进行协商。当这个期限正在逼近的时候，作为越南国际监督和监察委员会成员国之一的加拿大的外交部长却发表这种好像要规避它监督越南选举的责任的话，这很是令人难解。
    皮尔逊主张，选举要有自由。这是对的。可是这句话却又同一向竭力要破坏越南普选的杜勒斯和吴庭艳关于这个选举的谈话有些奇怪地相似之处。
    大家记得，杜勒斯曾经一再地叫嚷过“要在自由的条件下”才同意进行越南普选。他并且诬蔑说，在北越没有他所谓的这种“自由”。吴庭艳在美国指使下也公然要求什么“联合国监督选举”，他还学着杜勒斯的腔调说：“我们的政府是同意举行选举的，只要选举是自由的”。究竟这些卷起舌头来说话，为了使人不懂得他们的真意的家伙们是不是要一个真正的自由选举呢？
    真相早已给美英记者揭穿了。美国“展望”杂志就曾承认，如果进行自由普选，“绝大多数的越南人都会投共产党的票”。伦敦“泰晤士报”也说，南越居民“觉得越盟代表着希望”。这些报刊从任何意义上讲，都不可能说是共产党的。像这一类揭穿美国害怕在越南举行自由普选的话，从西方资产阶级报刊中还可以举出很多很多。
    正是因为这样，所以美国才处心积虑地指使吴庭艳在南越极力摧残自由，并阴谋破坏越南的自由普选。首先，美国竭力支持和指使吴庭艳集团在南越破坏日内瓦协议关于保障民主自由权利的规定，大规模屠杀和逮捕人民。据不完全统计，从一九五四年停战到今年一月，不到半年的期间内，吴庭艳就在南越干了二千三百多起屠杀人民的事件，八百多人被杀，三千七百多人负伤，一万三千多人被捕。随后，为了在普选不可避免时勉强凑投票人数，美国又指使法国殖民者用各种残酷和欺骗的办法来劫运北越居民，把他们置于吴庭艳的警察统治下面。现在美国正在指使吴庭艳在南越排除异己，挑起内战，施行恐怖统治。同时，它却又指使吴庭艳集团公布什么“选举法令”，“筹备”在南越进行由吴庭艳集团完全控制的、片面的所谓“选举”。看来美国是在抄袭它在南朝鲜的作法，企图经由片面“选举”的把戏，以在南越建立一个李承晚式的政权，破坏日内瓦协议，长期分裂越南，并把美国的国境线划在越南的领土上。“印度时报”记者在访问印度支那后就说，南越“正在逐步形成一种类似南朝鲜的那种军事独裁”。在那里，才真是丝毫不让人民有机会来表达他们的意见。
    是的，自由普选是日内瓦协议规定的，但美国却在破坏这种自由，也在力图破坏普选。杜勒斯和吴庭艳叫嚷说北越没有这种自由，无非是为了破坏和阻挠普选作伏笔。这种情况说明，根据日内瓦协议负有监督越南自由普选的责任的国际委员会面临着艰巨的任务。为了保障日内瓦协议的实施，为了保障印度支那和平，这个任务是不能逃避的。加拿大要想推卸这个监督的责任，显然是不符合日内瓦协议的。
    事实上谁都知道，美国和吴庭艳集团对于国际委员会的一切公正努力都表示了极大的憎恨。反映美国和吴庭艳集团意见的西贡电台曾公开诋毁越南国际监督和监察委员会，说它不能监督越南的普选。吴庭艳集团并且还曾发动了一个签名运动，指责国际委员会“无能”，要求它“自动解散”。由此可见，加拿大如果要用什么借口来规避它监督越南自由普选的责任，那就会有利于美国和吴庭艳集团破坏自由普选的阴谋，那就会危害日内瓦协议在越南的全部实施。
