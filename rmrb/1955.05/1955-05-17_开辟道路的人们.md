　　The People Who Open Roads
　　Gao Chu, Zhou Hang
　　Among the delegates to the National Model Highway Workers Congress, there are many military engineering representatives. They are heroes who participated in or are currently participating in the construction of highways in Xikang, Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Xinjiang.
　　Among these military engineering representatives, six represent model units. Among these model units is the famous "Zhang Fulin Squad." Model Communist Party member Comrade Zhang Fulin dedicated his precious life to the arduous project of conquering Mount Que'er. For more than three years, all comrades in the squad have carried forward the spirit of martyr Zhang Fulin, working hard in road construction, diligently studying engineering technology, and increasing average work efficiency to more than four times the standard efficiency. They have been awarded collective first-class merit three times. The labor competition they initiated has driven the entire road construction force.
　　The "Never Fading Red Flag Squad" is the squad formerly led by second-class road construction model Wang Hongcai. From Ganzi to Lhasa, this squad has taken on the most arduous road construction tasks time after time, and each task has been successfully completed. Their created experiences such as "group blasting," "staggered excavation and transportation," and "soil bomb stone crevice blasting" have been promoted to various units. Due to these creations, the squad has greatly improved work efficiency, saving the country more than 23,000 yuan over the years. Since becoming the "Red Flag Squad" in 1951, they have been awarded collective second-class merit four times, collective third-class merit once, and also won a prize flag issued by the division.
　　The spirit of the military engineering representatives, who are willing to sacrifice everything for the construction of the frontier, is very touching. They have a strong love and a strong sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause and revolutionary comrades. Comrade Qin Wenxue, one of the representatives elected to the presidium of the congress, once sacrificed himself to save more than thirty comrades from danger: Once, when he had already lit the fuse of a cannon on a construction site and was about to avoid it, he suddenly found that the thirty-plus comrades who had run to avoid it had returned, because the adjacent construction site had also been lit. The comrades were in immediate danger of being blown up. At this time, Qin Wenxue did not hesitate, quickly rushed to the cannon hole, and pulled out the burning fuses one by one, but by the last one, the fuse had already burned into the cannon hole and there was no time to pull it out. He quickly inserted a priming needle he was carrying into the cannon hole and stirred it vigorously. At this time, the cannon sounded, and the explosive air wave knocked him down, causing him to faint, but it prevented the comrades who did not have time to avoid it from being injured.
　　Youth League member and second-class road construction model Comrade Xiao Duke once suffered an injury in a mountain collapse, but he still entered and exited five times in the flying rocks and the dangerous situation of being crushed to pieces at any time, rescuing five comrades to a safe area.
　　"River Crossing Hero" Li Wenyan also attended the congress. He once bravely crossed the rapid current of eight meters per second, completed the task of setting up a cableway for the emergency crossing of the natural barrier of the Nujiang River, and created the preconditions for the rapid deployment of subsequent troops into construction and the early completion of the Nujiang River project.
　　We also saw a person with three fingers missing on his left hand. He is Comrade Mandenghu, who won a special merit award for building roads on the top of the Tianshan Mountains. During aerial work in the Tianqiaogou Stone Gorge, he was blown off a twenty-meter-high stone cliff by a gale, knocking out two front teeth. Although he fainted on the ground at the time, as soon as he woke up, he forgot himself and insisted on working. Later, he unfortunately had all three fingers blown off in a blasting accident, and only then did he leave the construction site for recuperation under everyone's persuasion.
　　First-class meritorious servant Comrade Yang Haiyin had his right calf bone broken in a landslide, but he stubbornly studied and exercised in the hospital, falling and getting up again, dropping his crutches to learn to walk, climb mountains, and jump, finally enabling himself to regain the ability to work for the motherland from a first-class, second-degree disabled person. They are as tenacious as the Soviet "Real Man" - Alexei Maresiev, who lost his feet and relearned to fly airplanes.
　　The deeds of these military engineering representatives are full of successful work experience, ways to overcome difficulties, and ingenious creations. The soldiers always use all their strength and think of all possible ways to create even greater achievements for the country.
　　Military engineering representative Xiang Shugui is a carpenter squad leader. Not only can he hang bridge piles in the air, but he also created the "traction and lifting beam method." This tool is simple to manufacture, but its efficiency is very high, increasing bridge building efficiency by three times. He also created the "template scribing oblique line method" and the "outline scribing method," which not only increased work efficiency by three and a half times, but also solved the problem of uneven bridge decks.
　　Yuan Zepu is an ordinary soldier. The "bulldozer boat" he created increased the average work efficiency of each person in the whole regiment by 3.2 times in the Zhegushan project alone. The whole regiment completed the task that originally required 140 days in more than 30 days, and eliminated the heavy physical labor in soil transportation, saving the country more than 40,700 yuan. This creation requires almost no capital, the manufacturing method is simple, it can be used everywhere, and it can be moved at any time, and anyone can operate it.
　　Military engineering representative Comrade Zheng Shaozhou should also be mentioned. In 1953, when building fort walls in the Mila Mountain earthquake zone, he discovered that the design had problems, the roadbed was not firm, and there was a possibility of subsidence, which would cause rework in the future, and automobile travel would be very dangerous. He actively put forward his opinions and corrective measures to the leadership. The leadership adopted his opinions, which not only saved 620 man-days, but more importantly, improved the quality of the project. On another occasion, after carefully studying a 60-meter-long curve engineering design, he found that the original design was neither economical nor of good quality. He actively put forward opinions, which resulted in saving 1,710 man-days and 80 pounds of explosives, and the project quality was very good.
　　These experiences and creations are the crystallization of the soldiers' hard work and painstaking research, and the result of not being afraid of difficulties and overcoming them.
　　In recent years, the soldiers participating in the construction of highways, together with the entire road construction army, have used their blood and sweat to open up unprecedented roads to the heart of the motherland on the "roof of the world." In the future, they will continue to use all their labor and wisdom to better connect the frontier and the interior, and defend and build the beloved frontier of the motherland.

　　开辟道路的人们
　　高处　周航
    在全国公路劳动模范代表大会中，有不少军工代表。他们是曾经参加过或正在参加修筑西康、西藏、青海、四川、云南、甘肃、新疆等地的公路的英雄们。
    在这些军工代表中，有六个是代表模范单位的。这些模范单位中有著名的“张福林班”。模范共产党员张福林同志，在征服雀儿山的艰险工程中，贡献出了自己的宝贵生命。三年多来，全班同志发扬了张福林烈士的精神，在筑路中艰苦劳动，努力钻研工程技术，使平均工作效率超过了标准工效的四倍，先后立了三次集体一等功。他们发起的劳动竞赛，带动了整个筑路部队。
    “永不褪色的红旗班”，是二级筑路模范王洪才以前所带领的班。从甘孜到拉萨，这个班一次接一次地担负了筑路中最艰巨的任务，每次任务都胜利地完成了。他们创造的“集团爆破”、“交错挖运”、“土炸弹石缝爆破”等经验，推广到各个单位。由于这些创造，这个班大大地提高了工作效率，几年来为国家节约了二万三千多元。从一九五
  一年成为“红旗班”以后，先后立了集体二等功四次，集体三等功一次，还荣获了师里发给的奖旗。
    军工代表们那种为了建设边疆而不惜牺牲一切的精神非常使人感动。他们对革命事业和革命同志抱有一种强烈的爱和强烈的责任感。代表中被推选为大会主席团成员之一的秦文学同志，曾不惜牺牲自己，拯救了三十多个同志脱险：有一次，他已经点燃了一块工地上的炮捻时，自己正要避开，突然发现跑去回避的三十多个同志又折了回来，因为旁边工地也已经点了炮。同志们马上就有被炸着的危险。这时秦文学毫不犹豫，迅速扑向炮眼，把正在烧着的引线一根根拔掉，但到最后一根，引线已经燃进炮眼，来不及拔掉了，他便迅速用身边带着的一根引针插到这个炮眼里用力搅动。这时，炮声已响了，火药爆炸的气浪一下子把他冲倒，使他昏了过去，但却使来不及避开的同志们没有受到损伤。
    青年团员、二级筑路模范肖读恪同志，曾在一次塌山中负了伤，但他仍在乱石纷飞、随时都有被砸得粉身碎骨的险境里进出五次，把五个战友抢救到安全区。
    “渡江英雄”李文炎也出席了这次大会。他曾奋不顾身，渡过流速每秒八公尺的急流，完成了抢渡天险怒江架设溜索的任务，为后续部队迅速投入施工、提前完成怒江工程创造了先决条件。
    我们还看到一个左手上缺少了三个指头的人，他就是在天山顶上修路中立过特等功的满登虎同志。他在天桥沟石峡进行悬空作业中，被狂风吹得从二十公尺高的石崖上滚落下来，碰落了两个门牙，当时虽然昏倒在地，但一醒过来他就又忘我地坚持工作。后来，不幸在爆破中又将三个手指头全部炸掉，他这才在大家的劝阻下离开工地去休养。
  一等功臣杨海银同志，在一次塌方中右腿小腿骨被折断了，但是他在医院里顽强地学习着、锻炼着，摔倒了再爬起来，丢掉拐杖学走路、学爬山、学跳跃，终于使自己由一个一等二级残废的人，又重新获得了为祖国劳动的能力。他们就是像苏联的“真正的人”——失去了脚又重新学会驾驶飞机的阿历克赛·马烈西叶夫一样的顽强的人。
    这些军工代表的事迹里，都充满了成功的劳动经验，克服困难的办法和巧妙的创造。战士们总是用尽一切力量，想尽一切办法，好了更好、多了再多地给国家创造出更大的成绩。
    军工代表相树桂是个木工班长，他不但能够悬空安桥桩，还创造了“牵挺顶梁法”，这种工具制造简单，但效率却很高，使架桥的工作效率提高了三倍。他还创造了“样板划斜线法”和“略子样划线法”，不但提高了工作效率三倍半，而且解决了桥面不平的问题。
    袁泽普是个普通战士。他创造的“推土船”只是在鹧鸪山工程中，就使全团每人每天的平均工作效率提高了三点二倍，全团用三十多天的时间就完成了原来需要一百四十天的任务，而且免去了运土中的繁重的体力劳动，为国家节约了四万零七百多元的开支。这种创造几乎不用本钱，制法简单，到处可用，而且可以随时移动，任何人都能操作。
    还应该提到军工代表郑绍周同志。一九五三年在米拉山地震区砌堡坎，他发现设计有毛病，路基不牢固，有下陷的可能，将来会造成返工现象，并且汽车行驶有很大危险。他积极向领导上提出意见和改正办法。领导上采纳了他的意见，结果不仅节约了六百二十个人工，更重要的是工程质量提高了。另一次，他又在仔细研究了一段六十公尺长的弯道工程设计以后，发现原设计既不经济，质量也不够好。他积极提出意见，结果又节约了一千七百一十个人工、八十斤炸药，而且工程质量很好。
    这些经验、创造，都是战士们艰苦劳动、刻苦钻研的结晶，都是不怕困难并战胜困难的结果。
    几年来，参加修筑公路的战士们，同整个筑路大军一起，用他们的血和汗，在“世界屋脊”上开辟了我国历史上空前未有的通向祖国心脏的道路。今后，他们仍将用自己全部的劳动和智慧，更好地沟通边疆和内地的联系，保卫和建设可爱的祖国边疆。
