Xinhua News Agency, London, May 3rd: According to TASS, the British Communist Party issued its election platform, stating: "The most important question in this election is: Peace, or a world war using atomic and hydrogen bombs?"

The platform states: "Communist candidates will oppose the Conservative and Labour right-wing leaders' decisions to produce hydrogen bombs, arm Nazis, and prepare for atomic war as allies of American millionaires."

The foreign policy section of the platform points out that the Conservative and Labour right-wing leaders, due to the people's desire for peace, are forced to talk about peace in the election. However, they are talking about "peace through strength" and insist that stockpiling hydrogen bombs can prevent war. In fact, this policy of expanding armaments always leads to war.

The platform advocates for immediate four-power negotiations, hoping that Britain will become a free and independent country able to live in peace. The platform states that Britain's policy should be: to replace the production of hydrogen bombs with international agreements prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, reducing all types of armaments, and ensuring European collective security; to replace the arming of West Germany with the establishment of a peaceful and democratic Germany; to allow China to enter the United Nations and return Taiwan to China; to withdraw American troops and aircraft from Britain; and to stop the wars in Kenya and Malaya.

The Communist Party has put forward a program to improve the people's material conditions, based on: reducing the production of weapons to the 1950 level, implementing genuine nationalization of important industrial sectors, reducing the huge profits of capitalists, and expanding Britain's trade, including trade with democratic countries.

　　英国共产党发表竞选纲领
    新华社三日讯　据塔斯社伦敦三日讯：英国共产党发表竞选纲领说：“这次选举中最重要的问题是：要和平呢，还是要使用原子弹和氢弹的世界战争？”
    纲领说：“共产党的候选人将反对保守党和工党右翼领导关于生产氢弹、武装纳粹分子以及作为美国亿万富翁的同盟者来准备原子战争的决定。”
    纲领的外交政策部分指出，保守党和工党右翼领导由于人民渴望和平而不得不在选举中高谈和平。但是他们所谈的是“以实力求和平”，并且硬说，储存氢弹可以防止战争。事实上，这种扩充军备政策总是要导致战争的。
    纲领主张立即进行四国谈判，希望英国成为一个自由和独立的国家，能够过和平的生活。纲领说，英国的政策应当是：以禁止原子武器和氢武器、裁减各种类型的军备和保障欧洲集体安全的国际协定来代替氢弹的生产；以建立和平民主的德国来代替武装西德；让中国进入联合国，把台湾归还中国；从英国撤退美国军队和飞机；停止在怯尼亚和马来亚的战争。
    共产党提出了改善人民物质状况的纲领，它的基础是：把武器的生产缩减到一九五○年的水平，重要的工业部门实行真正的国有化，减少资本家的巨额利润，扩大英国的贸易，包括对民主阵营国家的贸易在内。
