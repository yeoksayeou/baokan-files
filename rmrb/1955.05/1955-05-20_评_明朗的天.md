    Review of "A Bright Sky"
    Lü Ying
    The performance of Comrade Cao Yu's new work, "A Bright Sky," has achieved remarkable success. From its premiere on December 12th of last year by the Beijing People's Art Theatre until February 25th of this year, the theater was packed every day. The audience has been eagerly awaiting Comrade Cao Yu's new work, and "A Bright Sky" tells the audience that the author is continuing to strive for dramatic creation with a serious attitude.
    Most of the characters in "A Bright Sky" are intellectuals in universities. Old Chinese intellectuals grew up in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, burdened with heavy ideological baggage, including remnants of feudal consciousness and strong capitalist ideas. Those who grew up under the influence of American imperialism had more or less pro-American and pro-American thoughts. Except for a few who devoted themselves to the revolutionary cause early on, most did not begin to change their thinking until after the victory of the People's Liberation War, when Chinese society underwent fundamental changes. They gradually became aware of past mistakes and began to integrate with the people, embarking on the road of serving the people. "A Bright Sky" is a drama depicting the ideological transformation of old intellectuals.
    The play tells the story of doctors and professors at Yen Jen Medical College in Beijing. The central figure in the play is Ling Shixiang, a bacteriologist who has devoted himself to research for decades, hoping to use his research results to improve the well-being of the people. After liberation, this honest, sincere, and justice-minded scientist supported the Communist Party, but when the anti-imperialist patriotic movement was launched in the medical college, he had several questions he couldn't figure out: Did the United States have the purpose of cultural aggression by running hospitals and universities in China? Was American doctor Jackson a cultural spy? Do scientists have class character? Should science be combined with politics? At first, he doubted, pondered, and struggled, unable to find a solution (Act II, Scene II). Later, he participated in the work of the anti-bacterial warfare exhibition, saw the evidence of the crimes of American imperialists, and saw that the bacterial warfare he doubted was a real fact, and that there were indeed "murderous scientists," and he began to awaken (Act III, Scene I). At the same time, the attitude of Zhuang, the political commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteers, towards his daughter Ling Mulan in the hospital also touched and influenced him (Act III, Scene II). Finally, he saw with his own eyes that the American imperialists dropped Chinese field mice infected with the plague from airplanes, precisely using his research; and he also heard from another doctor, Sun Rong, that the bizarre death of the female patient Zhao Wangxiuzhen was the result of Jackson using her to experiment with typhus. At this point, he understood everything, and resolutely admitted his mistake to Dean Dong of the medical college, and requested to go to the Korean front to participate in the anti-bacterial warfare work, and participate in the struggle of the people's democratic camp against the American imperialists (Act III, Scene III). In the play, the author quite realistically portrays the image of this character and the process of his ideological transformation. The author's description of this character has broad educational significance and moved a wide audience.
    For the other old intellectuals in the play, the author also described their different performances and changes before and after liberation, according to their different life and ideological situations. After liberation, during the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, Chen Hongyou, who had shallower relations with American imperialists, mediocre ideas, but was not stubborn and did have some knowledge, showed a certain degree of progress. Sun Rong and You Xiaofeng, who were confused and despicable, and indulged in petty-bourgeois dreams of fame and fortune, only initially changed their position, and made little progress. Jiang Daozong, who had deeper relations with American imperialists, was more sophisticated, and stubbornly reactionary, changed very little; although Jackson's crimes had been exposed, the doctors had all awakened, and he himself had become a "lonely man," he was still hesitating and wandering, unable to make up his mind to break with his old ideas.
    Intellectuals like Jiang Daozong, Sun Rong, and You Xiaofeng existed in large numbers in old China. Their minds were filled with the ideas of the exploiting classes. They had never thought about the people and the country, nor had they thought about scientific truth; all they thought about was their personal interests, how to win the favor of the reactionary rulers, and even to the point of degenerating to be willing to be slaves of American imperialists. "A Bright Sky" broadly depicts the images of these characters, exposes their dirty faces, and points out that only by striving to transform their thinking and serving the people wholeheartedly is the correct path for old intellectuals. In this regard, "A Bright Sky" touches the sore spots of this type of people and sounds the alarm for them.
      "A Bright Sky" expresses the changes in the thoughts and feelings of old intellectuals after liberation, depicts the Party's policies toward intellectuals and the activities of Party members, and at the same time interweaves the conspiracies of imperialist elements, the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, and the living conditions of the working class before and after liberation, thus reflecting a facet of Chinese society in drastic change. The clarity of the thematic thought and revolutionary standpoint of this play is unmatched by the author's previous plays. And one of the characteristics of the author's plays—striving to realistically, vividly, and concretely describe the character, thoughts, and feelings—a characteristic with realistic qualities, has also been further developed in "A Bright Sky"; it strives to match the real reality, rather than simply pursuing dramatic composition. Because of all this, the audience warmly welcomed the performance of this play. In the author's creative path, "A Bright Sky" is a new and successful starting point.
      "A Bright Sky" has these achievements, but it also has some shortcomings.
    Before writing "A Bright Sky," the author studied the lives of the characters in the play in detail; after the script was written, it was repeatedly revised. The author's effort and energy spent on this play is no less than that of his previous plays. However, after watching it, the audience still feels that its power to move people is not strong enough, and therefore the impression gained is not deep enough. Many people think that its artistic achievement has not reached the level that the author had already reached before. What is the reason for this?
    The reason is definitely not, as some people imagine, that the author was frightened by the "knife" of the communist world outlook, but should be sought from the work itself.
    The main shortcoming of the drama is that the depiction of real life and the images of the characters in the play are relatively simple, lacking profound content. Ling Shixiang, the central character in the play, as a scientist, his thoughts and character, his attitude to life and his working spirit, all need to be described more concretely and profoundly; but now we can only know a rough idea from his conversations with others. Act II, Scene II in the play, located in Ling Shixiang's home, was originally a good place to concretely describe the life and thoughts of this scientist, but the entire act is occupied by abstract debates on ideological issues. The author says that Ling Shixiang is an outstanding scientist, but the author did not show on the stage the solemnity of him engaging in scientific work and pursuing scientific truth. In the first half of the drama, the audience almost only sees his stubborn side. Since the protagonist of the drama did not appear with a moving life, his ideological struggle inevitably reduces the color. Similarly, the inner world of Rong Lizhang, who is most closely related to the protagonist, has not been fully developed. The author paid attention to shaping the Communist Party members Dong Guanshan, He Changquan, and Zhuang Zhengwei in the work, but after all, they can only be said to be some appearances. The life of the medical college is vivid in the first act, but after the second act, the author has not been able to use his talent to fully depict the scenes of the new life after liberation in the entanglement of people's ideological contradictions. The anti-imperialist patriotic movement is a kind of struggle in real society, and the transformation of people's thoughts and the development of the movement cannot be without the basis of its real social life. When the struggle is mainly carried out not on the basis of life, but in ideological concepts, the storm in the drama is not easy to most powerfully shake the hearts of the audience.
    In the play, the author tries to unfold a broad picture, writing about the eve of liberation, writing about resisting America and aiding Korea, and writing about the liberation of workers; these all have their roles in reflecting reality and reflecting the times, especially in describing the ideological situation and living conditions of old intellectuals. However, these pictures cannot be said to be tightly combined on a main line. The main character active in these scenes is Ling Shixiang, but the characters that connect these scenes and connect the whole plot are the workers Zhao Shude and Zhao Wangxiuzhen. Zhao Wangxiuzhen's death has a decisive effect on Ling Shixiang's ideological transformation. The main character of the whole play (Ling Shixiang) cannot become the center of the plot, and the central characters (Zhao Shude and Zhao Wangxiuzhen) who connect the plot can only appear as episode-like characters. This is a basic flaw in the structure of "A Bright Sky." In addition to Zhao Shude and his wife, there are also some characters that are just episodic. For example, Zhuang Zhengwei's scene, although it played a role in showing reality and indirectly promoting Ling Shixiang's ideological transformation, this character has no close connection with the plot before and after; inserting scenes of singing and storytelling out of nowhere, although the author has made great efforts, inevitably cuts off the plot of the whole play, that is, the development of the contradiction and its climax. In the work, a broad picture of life is good, but if it is not out of the necessity of dramatic development, if it is only for arranging logical prerequisites, and there is no in-depth expression of the characters who appear, then it is difficult not to show traces of artificial piecing together and even caricature, and inevitably affects the integrity, depth and even its appeal of the work.
    Despite these shortcomings, the content of this play itself and its creative process fully demonstrate the author's serious attitude towards literary work. The author himself has not been immersed in the new life for long, so it is completely understandable that the expression of the new life has not reached a free and complete state. The author's enthusiasm for diligently studying the new life and the success he has achieved in restarting a long-interrupted creative life give us infinite hope and confidence in the author's future. The author strives to get rid of formulaic conceptualization in the play, and strives to describe the characters from life, which is why the drama has achieved its existing success. But anyone who has read the author's past works believes that the author's talent can make the existing success even greater. In the current work, the author's description of the characters in the play is generally still limited to superficial phenomena and superficial characteristics, and has not been able to raise them to the height of typicality. Superficial phenomena and superficial characteristics may be prominent things in life, but they are not the essential things in life. Superficial phenomena and characteristics can be grasped superficially, but essential things must go deep into the inside of people and life. In art, it is a theorem that one cannot be high without being deep.
    It should be said that "A Bright Sky," with its existing achievements, has far surpassed the current general works depicting the ideological transformation of intellectuals. But we hope that the author can strengthen, deepen, and improve it, and hope to do his best to "correctly express typical characters in a typical environment in addition to the truth of details" (Engels); because only in this way can literary and artistic works fully accomplish the task of educating readers and audiences with socialist ideas and spirit. It is said that the author is rewriting this play, and I hope that these simple opinions can also contribute to the author.

    评“明朗的天”
    吕荧
    曹禺同志的新作“明朗的天”的演出，得到了令人注意的成功。它从去年十二月十二日由北京人民艺术剧院上演、直到今年二月二十五日为止，剧院每天都客满。观众久已期待曹禺同志的新作了，“明朗的天”告诉了观众，作者是以严肃的态度继续努力于戏剧的创作的。
    “明朗的天”里大部分人物是高等学校中的知识分子。中国的旧知识分子是在半封建半殖民地的社会里成长起来的，背的思想包袱沉重得很，既有残余的封建意识，又有浓厚的资本主义思想；至于在美帝国主义影响下面成长的知识分子，更有或多或少的亲美崇美的思想。除了有少数人较早地献身革命事业以外，多数人直到人民解放战争胜利之后，中国的社会起了根本的变化，才开始在思想上发生变化，渐渐觉悟过去的错误，开始和人民结合，走向为人民服务的道路。“明朗的天”就是一个描写旧知识分子思想转变的戏剧。
    这个剧写的是北京燕仁医学院的医生和教授们的故事。剧里的中心人物是凌士湘，一个细菌学家，他几十年来一心一意地从事研究工作，希望能够用他研究的结果为人民增进幸福。在解放后，这个正直、真诚、赋有正义感的科学家是拥护共产党的，可是在医学院展开反帝爱国运动的时候，他有几个问题弄不清楚：美国在中国办医院办大学有进行文化侵略的目的吗？美国大夫贾克逊是文化特务吗？科学家有阶级性吗？科学要同政治结合吗？起初他怀疑、思索、苦恼，得不到解决（二幕二场）。后来他参加反细菌战展览会的工作，看到美帝国主义者的罪证，看到他所怀疑的细菌战是实在的事实，确实有“杀人的科学家”，他才开始觉悟（三幕一场）。同时医院中的病人中国人民志愿军的庄政委对待他女儿凌木兰的态度也使他受到感动，受到影响（三幕二场）。最后，他亲眼看到美帝国主义者从飞机上投下的感染了鼠疫的中国田鼠，正是利用的他的研究；并且又听到另一个大夫孙荣告诉他：女病人赵王秀贞的离奇的死，原来是贾克逊用她来实验斑疹伤寒的结果。这时候他明白了一切，于是毅然地向医学院的董院长承认自己的错误，并且要求到朝鲜前线去参加反细菌战工作，参加人民民主阵营对美帝国主义者的斗争（三幕三场）。在剧里，作者相当真实地描写了这个人物的形象和他的思想转变的过程。作者对于这个人物的描写具有广泛的教育意义，感动了广大的观众。
    对于剧里其他的旧知识分子，作者也都按各人的生活思想情况的不同，描写了他们在解放前后的不同的表现和变化。在解放以后，在反帝爱国运动中，同美帝国主义者关系较浅、思想平庸、可是并不顽固也确实有些学问的陈洪友，表现了一定程度的进步。糊涂而且卑鄙、沉迷在小资产阶级的名利梦想里的孙荣和尤晓峰，只是初步改变了立场，进步还不大。同美帝国主义者关系较深、世故也比较深、顽固反动的江道宗，就很少变化；虽然贾克逊的罪恶已经暴露，医生们都觉悟了，他自己已经成了“孤家寡人”，但他还在那里迟疑徘徊，下不了同旧思想分家的决心。
    江道宗、孙荣、尤晓峰式的知识分子，在旧中国是大量存在的。他们的头脑里充满剥削阶级的思想，他们没有想到过人民和国家，也没有想到过科学真理；他们所想的只是个人的私利，怎样才能得到反动统治者的欢心，甚至于能够堕落到甘心做美帝国主义者的奴才。“明朗的天”概括地描写了这些人物的形象，揭露了他们的肮脏的面目，并且指出唯有努力改造思想，全心全意为人民服务，才是旧知识分子正确的出路。在这方面，“明朗的天”触搔着了这一类人的痛处，向他们敲起了警钟。
      “明朗的天”表现了旧知识分子在解放后思想情感上的变化，描写了党对知识分子的政策和党员的活动，同时穿插着帝国主义分子的阴谋诡计，抗美援朝斗争，工人阶级翻身前后的生活状况，因而反映了激烈变化中的中国社会的一个面影。这个剧的主题思想和革命立场的明确，是作者以前的剧作所不能比拟的。而作者剧作的特色之一——力求真实地生动地具体地描写人物底性格、思想、情感，这一具有现实主义素质的特色，在“明朗的天”里也有了进一步的发展；它力求契合真实的现实，而不是仅仅追求戏剧性的构图。正因为这一切，观众热烈地欢迎了这个剧的演出。在作者的创作道路上，“明朗的天”是一个新的成功的起点。
      “明朗的天”有这些成就，可是也有它的一些缺点。
    作者写作“明朗的天”之前，曾经详细地研究过剧中人物的生活；剧本写出来之后，又经过一再的修改。作者在这个剧上所用的工夫和力量，不下于他以前的剧作。可是观众看了之后，仍然觉得它感动人的力量还不够强烈，因而所得的印象还不够深刻。许多人认为它的艺术成就还没有达到作者以前所已经达到的水平，这是什么原因呢？
    这原因，决不如某些人所想像的，是作者被共产主义世界观这把“刀子”吓坏了，而要从作品的本身去寻求。
    戏剧的主要缺点是剧中现实生活和人物形象的刻画都比较简略，缺乏深刻的内容。剧里的中心人物凌士湘，作为一个科学家，他的思想和性格，他的生活态度和工作精神，都需要有更具体更深刻的描写；可是现在我们仅能从他和别人的谈话里知道
  一个大概。剧里第二幕第二场，地点在凌士湘家里，本来是具体描写这个科学家的生活和思想的很好的场所，可是全幕都被思想问题的抽象的辩论占去了。作者说凌士湘是一个杰出的科学家，但是作者并没有在舞台上表现出他从事科学工作、追求科学真理的庄严，观众在戏剧的前半部也几乎只看到他的固执的一面。戏剧的主人翁既然没有以动人的生命出现，他的思想斗争就不免减少了彩色。同样，同主人翁关系最密切的容丽章的内心世界也没有得到充分的展开。作者对于作品中的共产党员董观山、何昌荃、庄政委是注意塑造的，但是究竟还只能说是一些面影。医学院的生活在第一幕里是有声有色的，但在第二幕以后，作者没有能够运用他的才力在人物思想矛盾的纠葛中充分描画解放后新生活的场景。反帝爱国运动是现实社会中的一种斗争，人的思想的转变和运动的发展都不能没有它的现实社会生活的基础。当斗争主要地不是在生活基础上进行，而是在思想概念中进行的时候，戏剧中的风暴就不容易最有力地震动观众的心弦了。
    作者在剧里力图展开广阔的画幅，写到解放前夕，写到抗美援朝，写到工人翻身；这些对于反映现实反映时代，尤其是对于旧知识分子思想情况生活情况的描写，都有它的作用。但是这些画幅还不能说已经紧密地结合在一根主线上。在这些画面中活动的主要人物是凌士湘，而连系这些画面，连系全剧情节的人物却是工人赵树德和赵王秀贞，赵王秀贞的死对于凌士湘的思想转变具有决定性的作用。全剧的主要人物（凌士湘）不能成为情节的中心，连系情节的中心人物（赵树德和赵王秀贞）只能作为插曲式的人物出现，这是“明朗的天”在结构上的一个基本缺点。除了赵树德夫妇以外，还有一些人物也只是插曲式的。例如庄政委的一场，虽然起了表现现实和间接促进凌士湘思想转变的作用，可是这个人物和前后的剧情都没有密切的关联；平地里插进唱歌说故事的场面，作者虽然费了苦心，却不免截断了全剧的情节，也就是矛盾的发展和它的高潮。在作品里，广阔的生活画面是好的，但是如果不是出于戏剧发展的必然，如果只是为着安置逻辑上的前提，而没有对出场的人物作深入的表现，那就很难不显出人为的拼砌的乃至漫画化的痕迹，不得不影响到作品的完整性、深刻性以至于它的感动力。
    虽然有这些缺点，这个剧本身的内容以及它的创作过程，充分表明了作者对待文学工作的严肃的态度。作者自己投入新生活也不久，因此对于新生活的表现还没有达到自由完满的境地是完全可以理解的。作者努力研究新生活的热诚和重新开始间断已久的创作生活时所获得的成功，使我们对作者的前途抱有无限的希望和信心。作者在剧里力求摆脱公式化概念化，力求从生活出发描写人物，这是戏剧所以得到它已有的成功的原因。但是凡是读过作者过去的作品的人，都相信作者的才力还可以使现有的成功更大。在现在的作品里，作者对剧中的人物的描写一般地还止于表面现象和表面特征，还没有能把他们提高到典型的高度。表面现象和表面特征可能是生活中突出的东西，但还不就是生活中本质的东西。表面的现象和特征在表面上就可以抓住，本质的东西却非深入人物和生活的内部不可。在艺术上，不深就不能高，这是一条定理。
    应当说，“明朗的天”以它现有的成就，已经远超出目前一般的写知识分子思想转变的作品之上。但是我们希望作者能够再把它加强、加深、提高，希望尽量做到“除了细节的真实之外，还要正确地表现出典型环境中的典型性格”（恩格斯）；因为只有这样，文学艺术作品才能充分完成以社会主义的思想精神教育读者和观众的任务。听说作者正在改写这个剧，但愿这里的一点简单的意见对作者也能够有所贡献。
