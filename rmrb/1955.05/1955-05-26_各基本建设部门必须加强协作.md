All Basic Construction Departments Must Strengthen Cooperation
Guo Yimin

In the first quarter, the basic construction tasks in the Xi'an area were not completed well. The five construction companies under the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau averaged 75 percent of the quarterly plan, and the Northwest Textile Construction Engineering Company only completed about 73 percent of the plan. What is the reason? Some say it is because of large changes in the basic construction plan, late design drawings, and the inability of local building materials to keep up with supply. Yes, these reasons have affected the progress of basic construction to varying degrees. However, there is also a fundamental reason, that is, there is a serious lack of cooperation between departments, which affects the preparation work for construction and the completion of the basic construction plan.

In the Xi'an area, this phenomenon of lack of cooperation is very common. As long as it is a department related to basic construction, varying degrees of non-cooperation have occurred. Taking the local materials supply department and the construction unit as an example, the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau applied to the Shaanxi Provincial Materials Supply Bureau for local materials for the first quarter of 1955 in August 1954. At that time, the Provincial Materials Supply Bureau required the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau to submit a materials plan. Without a plan, if the materials are produced but not needed, it will cause a backlog of funds. The Northwest Engineering Management Bureau initially did not submit a materials plan because the task was not determined. Although the task was later determined, it was not precise enough. They were afraid that if they submitted a plan, they would have to pay a partial deposit, and they were also afraid that changes in the task would cause a backlog of materials. The two sides argued endlessly about this issue. You say I have a sense of superiority in large industry, and I say you have insufficient understanding of key construction projects; you say I lack an overall view, and I say you are acting out of departmentalism. The two sides argued until construction was about to begin, and the local materials problem had not been resolved. Later, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee and the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China used internal allocation methods to solve part of the local materials problem. This delayed the construction progress in the first quarter. If the two sides did not each play their own game and negotiated in the spirit of being responsible for the entire construction cause, they could at least make part of the plan first and produce some urgently needed materials first, but neither side intended to do so, both fearing that their own unit would suffer losses. Now? Although neither side has suffered losses, national construction has suffered.

Between Party A and Party B, they are also entangled all day long. For example, the problem of how much to give for advance payments, who should repair the on-site transportation roads, etc., each holds its own opinion and refuses to give in. For example, a short road dedicated to transporting materials at a construction site in the western suburbs was debated for a long time over who should pay for the repairs. Party B said that they could not pay for the repairs because the road was not within the work area, and Party A said that they did not have the funds for this either. What should be done? Later, it was proposed that the Xi'an Municipal Construction Bureau should repair it, but the Construction Bureau said that their investment could only be responsible for repairing trunk lines, and could not be responsible for repairing branch lines specifically for transporting materials. Later, it was dragged to the transportation department, and the transportation department said that they were only responsible for transportation and not for road repairs. If you repair the road well, we can transport it quickly, and if you don't repair the road well, it will be transported slowly. The problem could not be solved for a long time. At that time, the construction site urgently needed sand, and Party B had to think of a temporary solution, using more than 600 sleepers to pave that branch line for transportation. Even such a small problem was dragged back and forth and could not be clarified. They didn't even think about how unworthy it was to affect the progress of the construction project for such a small problem!

The problem is not just this, some units under the leadership of the same department also do not cooperate with each other. There are three projects that belong to one department. It was originally planned to build a highway in the middle of the three projects. After this highway is completed, it will not only be convenient for transporting materials, but also be used after the project is completed. Therefore, it was proposed that the three construction units should build it together. The construction cost is shared according to the workload of each construction unit. It stands to reason that this is reasonable and in line with the principle of economy. However, the three Party A's negotiated for two months without any results. The first construction unit believed that they would suffer a loss if they did so. They were a cross-year project, and some materials had already been transported to the site, so they resolutely disagreed to pay for this. The second construction unit believed that they could temporarily use the highway newly built by the Xi'an Municipal Construction Bureau, so they also disagreed to pay for this. Only the third construction unit was left. They had to use this road, but they were afraid that the other two would also use it after it was repaired, so they were unwilling to pay all the construction costs alone. Later, they built a temporary road. On the surface, the problem seems to be solved, but in reality it has not been solved, because the rainy season is coming, and at that time, the transportation roads of the three units will still have problems. There is also the problem of the concrete prefabrication yard of the three projects undertaken by the Northwest First Engineering Company, which belong to one department. When the three projects organized the construction design, the contractor suggested that the three construction units jointly build a concrete prefabrication yard, saying that doing so had many advantages. It could save a lot of funds and equipment compared to each building a concrete prefabrication yard, and the contractor could also save manpower. Moreover, the concrete used in the three projects was of the same specifications, which could also ensure the uniformity of concrete specifications. At the beginning, the three Party A's agreed to this opinion in principle, but when it came to sharing the construction costs, they all disagreed. One Party A proposed that their task this year was small, and they could not pay for the construction this year. As a result, the other two construction units also considered that if the two jointly built it, they would have to pay more, so they were unwilling to jointly build it. They had asked their superiors for instructions, but it was not resolved. The joint concrete prefabrication yard has been delayed until now and has not been established. There are many more such incidents, which are not listed here.

The main reason for these non-cooperative phenomena is that each department has varying degrees of departmentalism. This departmentalism makes them unable to see the overall interests. However, some people do not admit that they have departmentalism. Some people say: "What kind of departmentalism is this? I am adhering to the economic accounting system!" This statement is obviously wrong. Do the facts listed above have anything in common with the economic accounting system of socialist enterprises? The economic accounting system of socialist enterprises is based on the overall interests of the country. It cannot harm the overall interests for the benefit of one unit, nor can it harm the interests of another unit for the benefit of this unit.

Some people also believe that the reason for this non-cooperative phenomenon is that the higher authorities have not made clear regulations. This statement is also wrong. Because even if there are clear regulations, without the correct thinking, the problem cannot be solved. Aren't there some regulations now? However, why are some problems that could have been solved not being solved? It can be seen that it is not entirely a problem of the system. Those who blame the non-cooperative phenomenon on the lack of clear regulations and systems are just trying to find excuses for their own departmentalism.

Basic construction work is an extremely complex and arduous task, and it is related to every department. If any department is separated from the entire construction task, problems will occur. Especially today, when conditions are insufficient, experience is lacking, and design and construction are carried out in the same year, all departments must overcome departmentalism, strengthen the overall concept in basic construction, and give full play to the spirit of being highly responsible to the country and the people.

　　各基本建设部门必须加强协作
　　郭一民
    第一季度，西安地区基本建设任务完成得不好，西北工程管理总局所属五个工程公司，平均完成本季度计划的百分之七十五，西北纺织建筑工程公司仅完成计划百分之七十三左右。什么原因呢？有人说是因为基本建设计划变动大，设计图纸出得迟，以及地方建筑材料供应不上等等。对的，这些原因都曾在不同程度上影响了基本建设进度。但是，还有一个基本的原因，那就是各部门之间存在严重的互不协作的现象，因此影响了施工的准备工作和基本建设计划的完成。
    在西安地区，这种互不协作的现象非常普遍。只要同基本建设关联的部门，都发生了程度不同的不协作的现象。以地方材料供应部门和施工单位为例，西北工程管理总局一九五四年八月就向陕西省物资供应局申请一九五五年第一季度的地方材料。当时省物资供应局要求西北工程管理总局一定要提出一个材料计划来，没有计划，生产出材料来，如果不要了，就会造成资金积压。西北工程管理总局开始因为任务没有确定，后来任务虽然确定了，但是任务还不够确切，始终没有提出材料计划，怕提出计划后就要预付一部分定金，又怕以后任务有变动造成材料积压。双方就为这个问题争执不休。你说我有大工业优越感，我说你对重点建设认识不足；你说我缺乏整体观念，我就说你本位主义。双方一直争到将要开工的时候，地方材料问题还没有得到解决。后来，中共陕西省委会和西安市委会用内部调剂的办法，才解决了一部分地方材料问题。这样就拖延了第一季度的施工进度。双方如果不各打自己的小算盘，都以对整个建设事业负责的精神来进行协商，至少可以先做出一部分计划和先生产
  一部分急用的材料，可是双方都不这样打算，都深怕本单位吃了亏，现在呢？双方虽说没有吃亏，而国家建设却受了损失。
    在甲、乙双方之间，也是成天纠缠不清。如预付款给多给少的问题，现场运输道路谁修的问题等，各执一词，互不相让。例如西郊某工地一条不长的专门运料用的道路，就因为谁出钱修的问题扯了很久。乙方说此路不在工区内他们不能出钱修，甲方说他们没有这笔款也不能出钱修。怎么办呢？后来提出要西安市建设局修，建设局表示，他们的投资只能负责修干线，像这样专门运料用的支线不能负责修。以后又扯到运输部门，运输部门表示只管运输不管修路，你们修好道路我们运得快，修不好道路就运得慢。就这样扯了很久不能解决问题。当时工地上急需要砂子，乙方不得不想临时办法，用了六百多根枕木铺在那条支线上，进行运输。就是这样一个不大的问题也扯来扯去扯不清楚。他们也不想想为这么一个小问题而影响了建设工程进度，多么不值得！
    问题还不只此，有的同一个部门领导下的几个单位也互不协作。有三个工程是属于一个部门的。三个工程中间原计划要修一条公路，这条公路建成后不仅运料方便，而在工程竣工后也是要用的。于是就提出由三个建筑单位共同修建。修建费按各工程单位的工作量来分摊。照理说这样做是合理的，而且符合节约的原则。但是，三个甲方协商了两个月都没有结果。第一个建筑单位认为这样办自己吃亏，他们是跨年度工程，而且有部分材料已经运到现场，于是就坚决不同意出这笔钱。第二个建筑单位认为他们暂时可以利用西安市建设局新建的公路，因此，也不同意出这笔钱。剩下来只有第三个建筑单位，他们一定要用这条路，但是怕修好后其他两家也用，不愿意独家出全部修建费，后来就修了一条临时的道路。从表面上看这个问题算解决了，但是实际上并没有解决，因为雨季就要到来，那时候，三个单位的运输道路还要发生问题。还有西北第一工程公司承建的属于一个部门的，三个工程的混凝土预制场的问题。在三个工程组织施工设计时，承建单位就建议三个建筑单位合建一个混凝土预制场，并说这样做有很多好处，比一家建一个混凝土预制场可以节省很多资金和设备，承建单位也可以节省人力，而且三个工程所用的混凝土都是一样的规格，这样还可以保证混凝土规格的统一。开始，三个甲方原则上同意了这个意见，但是，当谈到分摊建筑费的时候，就都不同意了。有一个甲方提出他们今年的任务小，今年不能出钱修建。这样一来，其他两个建筑单位也考虑到如果两家合建就要多出钱，因此也不愿意合建了。他们曾向上级请示过，但是也没有解决。联合混凝土预制场就一直拖到现在未能建立。像这样的事件还多，这里不列举了。
    产生这些互不协作现象的主要原因是各部门都有程度不同的本位主义思想。这种本位主义的思想使他们看不见整体的利益。然而，有些人却不承认自己有本位主义思想。有的人说：“这算什么本位主义思想呢？我这是坚持经济核算制度呀！”这种说法显然是不对的，难道上面列举的事实和社会主义企业的经济核算制度有一点相同之处吗？社会主义企业的经济核算制度是建立在国家整体利益的基础上的，它不能为了某一个单位的利益而损害整体利益，也不能为了本单位的利益而损害另一个单位的利益。
    也有一些人认为所以发生这种互不协作的现象，是因为上级没有作明确规定。这种说法也是错误的。因为即使有了明确的规定，而没有正确的思想，也是不能解决问题的。现在不是也有一些规定吗？但是，为什么一些本来可以解决的问题得不到解决呢？可见还不尽然是制度的问题。那些把互不协作现象归罪于缺乏明确规定和制度的人，不过是企图为自己的本位主义思想找借口罢了。
    基本建设工作是一项极其复杂而又艰巨的工作，它同每个部门都有关系。任何一个部门如果同整个建设任务脱节，就会发生问题。特别在今天条件不够、经验不足和当年设计当年施工的情况下，各部门必须克服本位主义思想，加强基本建设中的整体观念，发挥对国家对人民高度负责的精神。
