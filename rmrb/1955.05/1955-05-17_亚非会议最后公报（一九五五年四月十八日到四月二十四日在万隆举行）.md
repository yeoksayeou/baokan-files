FINAL COMMUNIQUE OF THE ASIAN-AFRICAN CONFERENCE
(Held in Bandung from April 18 to April 24, 1955)

At the invitation of the Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia and Pakistan, the Asian-African Conference met in Bandung from April 18 to 24, 1955. In addition to the five initiating countries, the following twenty-four countries participated in the Conference: 1. Afghanistan, 2. Cambodia, 3. People's Republic of China, 4. Egypt, 5. Ethiopia, 6. Gold Coast, 7. Iran, 8. Iraq, 9. Japan, 10. Jordan, 11. Laos, 12. Lebanon, 13. Liberia, 14. Libya, 15. Nepal, 16. Philippines, 17. Saudi Arabia, 18. Sudan, 19. Syria, 20. Thailand, 21. Turkey, 22. Democratic Republic of Vietnam, 23. State of Vietnam, 24. Yemen.

The Asian-African Conference considered problems of common interest and concern to countries of Asia and Africa and discussed ways and means by which their people could achieve fuller economic, cultural and political cooperation.

A. Economic Cooperation

1. The Asian-African Conference recognized the urgency of promoting economic development in the Asian-African region. There exists among the participating countries a universal desire for economic cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual respect for national sovereignty. The proposals on economic cooperation within the participating countries do not preclude either the desirability or the need for cooperation with countries outside the region, including investment of foreign capital. It was further recognized that the assistance being received by certain participating countries from outside the region, through international or bilateral arrangements, had contributed substantially to the implementation of their development programs.

2. The participating countries agreed to provide technical assistance to each other to the greatest extent practicable, in the form of: experts, trainees, pilot projects for demonstration purposes, equipment for demonstration, exchange of know-how and establishment of national, and where possible, regional training and research institutes for imparting technical knowledge and skills in cooperation with the existing international agencies.

3. The Asian-African Conference recommended: the early establishment of a Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development; allocation by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development of a greater part of its resources to Asian-African countries; the early establishment of an International Finance Corporation which should include among its activities the undertaking of equity investment; and encouragement of joint ventures among Asian-African countries in so far as this will promote their common interest.

4. The Asian-African Conference recognized the vital need for stabilizing commodity trade in the region. The Conference endorsed the principle of enlarging the scope of multilateral trade and payments arrangements. However, the Conference recognized that some countries were constrained to have recourse to bilateral trade arrangements in view of their prevailing economic conditions.

5. The Asian-African Conference recommended that participating countries take collective action for stabilizing the international prices of and demand for primary commodities through bilateral and multilateral arrangements, and that they should cooperate with each other in the United Nations Commission on International Commodity Trade, and other international agencies, to that end as far as practicable and appropriate.

6. The Asian-African Conference further recommended that Asian- African countries should, in so far as economically feasible, process their raw materials before export with a view to diversifying their export trade; promote intra-regional trade fairs; encourage exchange of trade delegations and businessmen; encourage exchange of information and samples with a view to promoting intra-regional trade; and provide normal facilities for the transit trade of landlocked countries.

7. The Asian-African Conference attached considerable importance to shipping and expressed concern that shipping lines often discriminated against participating countries, and it was recommended that consideration be given to the establishment of national shipping lines and to the early establishment of regional shipping lines.

8. The Asian-African Conference agreed that encouragement should be given to the establishment of national and regional banks and insurance companies.

9. The Asian-African Conference felt that exchange of information on matters relating to oil, such as remittance of profits and taxation, might eventually lead to formulation of common policies.

10. The Asian-African Conference emphasized the particular significance of the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes for Asian-African countries. The Conference welcomed the initiative of the Powers principally concerned in offering to make available information regarding the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes; urged the speedy establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency which should provide for adequate representation of the Asian-African countries on the executive authority of the Agency; and recommended to the Asian and African Governments to take full advantage of the training facilities and other forms of assistance offered by the countries sponsoring such programmes.

11. The Asian-African Conference agreed to appoint Liaison Officers in participating countries, to be nominated by their respective Governments, for the exchange of information and ideas on matters of mutual interest. It recommended that fuller use should be made of the existing international organizations, and participating countries who were not members of such international organizations, but were eligible, should secure membership.

12. The Asian-African Conference recommended that there should be prior consultation of participants at international forums with a view, as far as possible, to furthering their mutual economic interests. It also recommended that studies should be undertaken, in particular by the Secretariat of the Conference, of questions relating to economic cooperation, with the object of ascertaining possibilities of Asian-African economic cooperation.

B. Cultural Cooperation

1. The Asian-African Conference was convinced that among the most powerful means of promoting understanding among nations is the development of cultural cooperation. Asia and Africa have been the cradle of great religions and civilizations which have enriched other cultures and civilizations while themselves being enriched in the process. Thus, the cultures of Asia and Africa are based on spiritual and universal foundations. Unfortunately, cultural contacts among Asian and African countries were interrupted during the past few centuries. The peoples of Asia and Africa are now animated by a keen and sincere desire to renew their old cultural contacts and develop new ones in the context of the modern world. All participating Governments re-affirmed their determination to work for closer cultural cooperation.

2. The Asian-African Conference took note of the fact that the existence of colonialism in many parts of Asia and Africa, in whatever form it may be, not only prevents cultural cooperation but also suppresses the national cultures of the people. Some colonial powers have denied to their dependent peoples basic rights in the sphere of education and culture, which hampers the development of their personality and also prevents cultural intercourse with other Asian and African peoples. This is particularly true in the case of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, where the basic rights of the people to study their own language and culture have been suppressed. Similar discrimination has been practised against Africans or people of African descent in some parts of the Continent of Africa. The Conference felt that these policies amount to a denial of fundamental human rights, impede cultural advancement in the area and also obstruct cultural cooperation on the wider international plane. The Conference condemned such a denial of fundamental rights in the sphere of education and culture in some parts of Asia and Africa by this form of cultural suppression.

In particular, the Conference condemned racialism as a means of cultural suppression.

3. It is not from any sense of exclusiveness or antagonism towards other groups of nations in other continents or civilizations and cultures that the Conference views cultural co-operation among Asian and African countries. True to the age-old tradition of tolerance and universality, the Conference believed that Asian and African cultural cooperation should be developed in the larger context of world co-operation.

Side by side with their efforts to develop Asian-African cultural cooperation, the Asian and African countries desire to develop cultural contacts with others. This would enrich their own cultures and would also help in the promotion of world peace and understanding.

4. There are many countries in Asia and Africa which have not yet been able to develop their educational, scientific and technical institutions. The Conference recommended that countries in Asia and Africa which are more fortunately placed in this respect should give facilities for the admission of students and trainees from such countries to their institutions. Such facilities should also be made available to the Asian and African people residing outside their national territories who have had less opportunities of higher education.

5. The Asian-African Conference was of the opinion that with a view to promoting cultural co-operation among countries of Asia and Africa, the following steps should be taken:
	(i) to acquire knowledge of each other’s country;
	(ii) to exchange cultural missions;
	(iii) to exchange information.

6. The Asian-African Conference was of the opinion that at the present stage it would be best to take bi-lateral arrangements on a country to country basis for cultural co-operation.

C. Human Rights and Self-Determination

1. The Asian-African Conference declared its full support of the fundamental principles of human rights as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and took note of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.

The Conference declared its full support of the principle of self-determination of peoples and nations as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and took note of the United Nations resolutions on the rights of peoples and nations to self-determination, which is a pre-requisite of the full enjoyment of all fundamental Human Rights.

2. The Asian-African Conference deplored the policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination which form the basis of government and human relations in large regions of Africa and in other parts of the world. Such conduct is not only a gross violation of human rights, but also a denial of the fundamental values of civilization and the dignity of man.

The Conference extended its warm sympathy and support for the courageous stand taken by the victims of racial discrimination, especially by peoples of African and Indian origin in South Africa; commended the peoples and governments of Asian and African countries for their efforts to abolish racial discrimination and affirmed that racial discrimination is a flagrant violation of fundamental human rights and the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.

D. Problems of Dependent Peoples

1. The Asian-African Conference discussed the position of dependent peoples and colonialism and the evils arising therefrom.

The Conference is agreed:
	(a) in declaring that colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil which should speedily be brought to an end;
	(b) in affirming that the subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights, is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and is an impediment to the promotion of world peace and co-operation;
	(c) in declaring its support of the cause of freedom and independence for all such peoples; and
	(d) in calling upon the powers concerned to grant freedom and independence to such peoples.

2. In view of the unsettled situation prevailing in North Africa and of the denial to the peoples of North Africa of their right to self-determination, the Asian-African Conference declared its support of the rights of the people of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to self-determination and independence and urged the French Government to bring about a peaceful settlement of the issue without delay.

E. Other Problems

1. In view of the existing tension in the Middle East, caused by the situation in Palestine and of the danger of that tension to world peace, the Asian-African Conference declared its support of the rights of the Arab people of Palestine and called for the implementation of the United Nations Resolutions on Palestine and the achievement of the peaceful settlement of the Palestine question.

2. The Asian-African Conference, in the context of its expressed attitude on the abolition of colonialism, supported the position of Indonesia in the case of West Irian based on the relevant agreements between Indonesia and the Netherlands.

The Asian-African Conference urged the Netherlands Government to reopen negotiations as soon as possible, to implement their obligations under the above-mentioned agreements; and expressed the earnest hope that the United Nations should assist the parties concerned in finding a peaceful solution to the dispute.

3. The Asian-African Conference supported the position of Yemen in the case of Aden and the Southern Protectorates and urged the parties concerned to arrive at a peaceful settlement of the dispute.

F. Promotion of World Peace and Cooperation

1. The Asian-African Conference, taking note of the fact that several States have not yet been admitted to the United Nations, considered that for effective co-operation for the maintenance of international peace and security the membership of the United Nations should be universal, called on the Security Council to support the admission of all such States which are qualified under the Charter. In the opinion of the Asian-African Conference, the following among participating countries were qualified: Cambodia, Ceylon, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Libya, Nepal, a unified Vietnam.

The Conference considered that the representation of Asian and African countries on the Security Council, in relation to the principle of equitable geographical distribution, was inadequate. It expressed its view that as regards the distribution of the non-permanent seats, the Asian-African countries should be given more consideration.

2. The Asian-African Conference, having considered the dangerous situation of international tension existing and the risks confronting the world arising therefrom, is convinced that any aggression wherever it occurs or whatever it may be, should be resisted by the collective strength of peace loving nations.

The Conference considered that disarmament and the prohibition of the production, experimentation and use of nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons of war are imperative to save mankind and civilization from the fear and prospect of wholesale destruction. It considered that the Asian-African countries have an important role to play in the settlement of outstanding international problems and in contributing towards reducing international tension.

　　亚非会议最后公报
　　（一九五五年四月十八日到四月二十四日在万隆举行）
    （新华社按：本社前在四月二十四日发表的亚非会议最后公报是非正式定本，其中译文有若干错漏。这次发表的最后公报是根据亚非会议联合秘书处最后发出的英文定本校正的中文定本。中文本以此为准。）
    在缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦总理邀请下召开的亚非会议于一九五五年四月十八日至二十四日在万隆举行了会议。除了五个发起国之外，参加会议的有下列二十四个国家：一、阿富汗，二、柬埔寨，三、中华人民共和国，四、埃及，五、埃塞俄比亚，六、黄金海岸，七、伊朗，八、伊拉克，九、日本，十、约旦，十一、老挝，十二、黎巴嫩，十三、利比里亚，十四、利比亚，十五、尼泊尔，十六、菲律宾，十七、沙特阿拉伯，十八、苏丹，十九、叙利亚，二十、泰国，二十一、土耳其，二十二、越南民主共和国，二十三、越南国，二十四、也门。
    亚非会议考虑了亚洲和非洲国家有共同利害关系和共同关心的问题，并且讨论了它们各国人民可以用来实现更充分的经济、文化和政治合作的办法。
    甲、经济合作
    一、亚非会议认识到促进亚非区域的经济发展的迫切性。在与会国中存有在互利和互相尊重国家主权的基础上实行经济合作的普遍愿望。关于与会国之间的经济合作的建议，并不排除同这个区域以外的国家合作的适宜性和必要性，这种合作包括外国投资在内。此外还认识到，某些与会国通过国际安排或双边安排，从这个区域以外获得的援助，对实行它们的发展计划作出了有价值的贡献。
      二、与会国同意在实际可行的最大程度上互相提供技术援助，方式是：专家，受训人员，供示范用的试验工程和装备，交换技术知识，在现有的国际机构的合作下，设立国家的和在可能的情况下设立区域的训练和研究机构，以便教授技术知识和技能。
    三、亚非会议建议：早日设立联合国经济发展特别基金；由国际复兴开发银行拨出更大一部分的资力给亚非国家；早日设立国际金融公司，其活动应当包括进行股权投资；鼓励促进亚非国家之间的联合企业，如果这样做能促进它们的共同利益的话。
    四、亚非会议认识到稳定本区域商品贸易的重大需要。会议接受了扩大多边贸易和支付的范围的原则。但是会议认识到，有些国家鉴于它们目前的经济情况，将必须采用双边贸易安排。
    五、亚非会议建议：与会国采取集体行动，通过双边安排和多边安排来稳定原料商品的国际价格和需要；并建议它们在切实可行和适当的范围内，在联合国国际商品贸易常设顾问委员会和其他国际机构中对这个问题采取一致的态度。
    六、亚非会议并建议：亚非国家只要在经济上可行时就把它们的原料在出口前加工，以便使它们的出口贸易具有多样性；举办区域内的贸易博览会，并鼓励互派贸易代表团和商人团体；鼓励交换情报和样品，以促进区域内的贸易；并为内陆国家的过境贸易提供正常的便利。
    七、亚非会议十分重视航运，并且对航运公司常在有损于与会国的情况下时时修订它们的运费率表示不安。会议建议对这个问题进行研究，并在此后采取集体行动劝导航运公司采取一种较为合理的态度。会议认为，可以对过境贸易的铁路货运进行研究。
    八、亚非会议同意，应该鼓励建立国家的和区域的银行和保险公司。
    九、亚非会议认为，在有关石油的问题上交换情报，例如利润的汇兑和税收等，最后可能导向共同政策的制订。
    十、亚非会议强调指出，发展核子能的和平用途对亚非国家特别有意义。会议欢迎主要有关国家表示愿意提供关于把原子能用于和平目的的情报的倡议；要求迅速成立国际原子能机构，这个机构应当规定亚非国家在这个机构的执行机关中的充分代表权；并建议亚非国家政府在原子能的和平利用方面充分利用发起这种计划的国家所提供的训练方面和其他方面的便利。
    十一、亚非会议同意在与会国中指派联络官，其人选由他们本国的政府提名，以便就有共同利害关系的问题交换情报和意见。会议建议更充分地利用现有的国际组织，并建议凡不是这种国际组织的成员但是有资格作为成员的与会国取得成员地位。
    十二、亚非会议建议与会国在国际会谈中事先进行磋商，以便尽可能促进它们共同的经济利益。但是这并不是要成立一个区域性集团。
      乙、文化合作
    一、亚非会议深信，发展文化合作是促进各国之间的了解的最有力的方法之一。亚洲和非洲是伟大宗教和文明的摇篮，这种宗教和文明丰富了其他的文化和文明，同时自己也在这个过程中得到丰富。因此，亚洲和非洲的文化是建立在精神的和普遍性的基础上的。不幸，在过去若干世纪中，亚洲和非洲国家之间的文化接触中断了。亚非各国人民现在都怀着一种热诚真挚的愿望，在现代世界的范围内恢复他们旧有的文化接触和发展新的文化接触。各与会国政府重申它们要为更密切的文化合作而努力的决心。
    二、亚非会议注意到：殖民主义在亚洲和非洲许多地区的存在，无论它具有什么形式，都不仅妨碍文化合作，而且压制人民的民族文化。某些殖民国家拒绝给予它们的附属地人民以教育和文化方面的基本权利，从而妨碍他们的个性的发展，并且阻止他们同其他亚非人民的文化交流。突尼斯、阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥的情况尤其是这样，在那里，人民研究他们自己的语文和文化的基本权利受到了压制。对非洲某些地区的非洲人和有色人民也一直在实行着类似的歧视。会议认为：这些政策等于否定基本人权，这些政策妨碍本地区的文化进步，并阻碍更广泛的国际范围内的文化合作。会议谴责在亚洲和非洲某些地区以这种或别种形式的文化压制来这样否定教育和文化方面的基本权利的现象。
    会议特别谴责种族主义，认为这是一种压制文化的工具。
    三、会议在看待亚洲和非洲国家之间的文化合作的发展时，不是抱着任何排外或者同其他国家集团以及其他文明和文化相敌对的观念。会议忠于宽容和协和的悠久传统，认为亚洲和非洲的文化合作应当在更大的世界合作的范围内发展。
    亚洲和非洲国家希望在发展亚非文化合作的同时，同其他国家发展文化接触。这会丰富它们自己的文化，并且还会有助于促进世界和平和了解。
    四、亚洲和非洲有许多国家现在还没有能够发展它们自己的教育、科学和技术机构。会议建议亚洲和非洲的在这方面处境比较幸运的国家在接受上述这种国家的学生和受训人员进入它们机构方面给予便利。这种便利也应当提供给目前得不到受高等教育的机会的居住在非洲的亚洲人和非洲人。
    五、亚非会议认为，促进亚非国家文化合作的努力应当导向：
      （一）取得对于彼此国家的知识；
      （二）彼此文化交流；
      （三）交换情报。
    六、亚非会议认为，在目前阶段，在一切可能和可行的情况下进行双边安排和由每一国家自行采取行动来实施会议的建议，将会在文化合作方面取得最好的结果。
      丙、人权和自决
    一、亚非会议宣布它完全支持联合国宪章中所提出的人权的基本原则，并且注意到作为所有人民和所有国家努力实现的共同标准的世界人权宣言。
    会议宣布它完全支持联合国宪章中所提出的人民和民族自决的原则，并注意到联合国关于人民和民族自决权利的各项决议，自决是充分享受一切基本人权的先决条件。
    二、亚非会议对于成为非洲广大区域和世界其他地方的政府和人的关系的基础的种族隔离和歧视的政策和实践感到遗憾。这种行为不仅是对人权的粗暴的侵犯，而且是对文明的基本价值和人类尊严的否定。
    会议热烈同情和支持种族歧视的受害者，特别是南非境内非洲、印度和巴基斯坦血统的人民所采取的勇敢立场；赞扬所有支持他们的事业的人们；重申亚非各国人民决心根除可能存在于他们本国的种族主义的一切痕迹；保证运用它的全部道义影响，谨防在进行根除这一祸害的斗争时也陷入同样祸害的危险。
    丁、附属地人民问题
    一、亚非会议讨论了附属地人民和殖民主义问题和由于人民遭受外国的征服、统治和剥削而造成的祸害。
    会议协议：
      （子）宣布殖民主义在其一切表现中都是一种应当迅速予以根除的祸害；
      （丑）确认人民遭受外国的征服、统治和剥削是对基本人权的否定，是对联合国宪章的违反，是对于促进世界和平和合作的一种障碍；
      （寅）宣布会议支持所有这种人民的自由和独立的事业；并
      （卯）要求有关国家给予这种人民以自由和独立。
    二、鉴于北非不安定的局面，鉴于北非各国人民的自决权利继续被固执地否定，亚非会议宣布支持阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯人民的自决和独立权利，并要求法国政府不迟延地促成这一问题的和平解决。
      戊、其他问题
    一、鉴于由巴勒斯坦局势所引起的中东现存的紧张局势和这种紧张局势对世界和平的危险，亚非会议宣布它支持巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人民的权利，并要求实施联合国关于巴勒斯坦的各项决议和实现巴勒斯坦问题的和平解决。
    二、亚非会议按照它对废除殖民主义所表明的态度，支持印度尼西亚在西伊里安问题上根据印度尼西亚和荷兰的有关协定而采取的立场。
    亚非会议要求荷兰政府尽快恢复谈判，以履行它依据上述协定而承担的义务；并表示热切希望联合国将协助有关方面来寻求这一争端的和平解决。
    三、亚非会议支持也门在亚丁和被称为保护国的也门南部地区问题上的立场，并要求有关方面获致这一争端的和平解决。
    己、促进世界和平和合作
    一、亚非会议注意到若干国家仍然没有被接纳进入联合国这一事实，认为为了进行有效的合作以促进世界和平起见，联合国的会员应当具有普遍性，要求安全理事会支持接纳所有按照宪章具备会员国条件的国家。亚非会议认为，与会国中下列国家具备这样的条件，即：柬埔寨、锡兰、日本、约旦、老挝、利比亚、尼泊尔，一个统一的越南。
    会议认为，根据公平的地理分配的原则，亚非地区国家在安全理事会中的代表权是不充分的。会议认为，关于非常任理事席位的分配，应该使根据一九四六年在伦敦达成的安排而不得当选的亚非国家能够参加安全理事会，以便它们可能对维护国际和平和安全作出更有效的贡献。
    二、亚非会议考虑了目前国际紧张局势的危险情势和整个人类面临的爆发世界大战的危险——在这种战争中将会使用包括核子武器和热核子武器的所有种类的军备的毁灭性力量——，兹促请所有国家注意这样一种战争如果爆发所会带来的可怕后果。
    会议认为裁减军备和禁止生产、试验和使用核子和热核子作战武器，对于拯救人类和文明免受大规模毁灭的恐惧和前景是紧迫需要的。它认为，在这里开会的亚非国家，为了人类和文明，有责任宣布它们支持裁军和禁止这些武器并呼吁主要有关国家和世界舆论来促进裁军和禁止这些武器。
    会议认为应当建立和维持有效的国际监督来实施裁军和禁止这些武器，并且应当作出迅速的和坚决的努力以达到这个目的。
    在完全禁止制造核子武器和热核子武器之前，本会议呼吁所有有关国家达成协议停止试验这种武器。
    会议宣布普遍裁军是维护和平所绝对必需的，要求联合国继续它的努力并呼吁一切有关方面迅速促成一切武装力量和军备的管制、限制、监督和裁减，包括禁止一切大规模毁灭性武器的生产、试验和使用，并为此目的建立有效的国际监督。
    庚、关于促进世界和平和
          合作的宣言
    亚非会议焦虑地考虑了世界和平和合作问题。会议对具有可能发生一场原子世界战争的危险的目前国际紧张局势，表示深切的关怀。和平问题同国际安全问题是互相关联的。在这方面，一切国家都应当合作，特别是通过联合国，以促成在有效的国际监督下裁减军备和消除核子武器。这样，国际和平就可以促进，核子能就可以完全用于和平的目的。这将有助于满足特别是亚洲和非洲的需要，因为他们迫切的要求是社会进步和在更大的自由条件下提高生活水平。
    自由和和平是相互依靠的，自决的权利必须为一切人民所享有，自由和独立必须尽可能不迟延地给予现在仍旧是附属地人民的人们。的确，一切国家都应当有权按照联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，自由选择它们自己的政治和经济制度和它们自己的生活方式。
    各国应当在消除不信任和恐惧、彼此以信任和善意相待的情况下，在下列原则的基础上，作为和睦的邻邦彼此实行宽容，和平相处，并发展友好合作：
    一、尊重基本人权、尊重联合国宪章的宗旨和原则。
    二、尊重一切国家的主权和领土完整。
    三、承认一切种族的平等、承认一切大小国家的平等。
    四、不干预或干涉他国内政。
    五、尊重每一国家按照联合国宪章单独地或集体地进行自卫的权利。
    六、（子）不使用集体防御的安排来为任何一个大国的特殊利益服务；
          （丑）任何国家不对其他国家施加压力。
    七、不以侵略行为或侵略威胁或使用武力来侵犯任何国家的领土完整或政治独立。
    八、按照联合国宪章，通过如谈判、调停、仲裁或司法解决等和平方法以及有关方面自己选择的任何其他和平方法来解决一切国际争端。
    九、促进相互的利益和合作。
    十、尊重正义和国际义务。
    亚非会议宣布它确信按照这些原则的友好合作对于维持和促进国际和平和安全将会作出有效的贡献，而在经济、社会和文化方面的合作将有助于促进大家的共同繁荣和福利。
    亚非会议建议五个发起国在同与会国协商之下，考虑召开亚非会议下届会议的问题。
                一九五五年四月二十四日·万隆
