Title: We Cannot Use "Increased Production" as an Excuse to Cancel Thrift

In Northeast China, many factories and construction sites had, for quite some time, a prevailing notion: “Putting basic construction into production earlier is the greatest saving,” and “Increased production is the greatest saving.” In many places, under the fine-sounding names of "striving to put into production a day earlier" and "production is everything," a tolerant and permissive attitude was adopted towards waste, and the actual struggle for thrift and against waste was cancelled. According to investigations by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in 1954, the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant suffered losses totaling 5,235,300 yuan due to defective products, rejected products, and work stoppage losses, plus waste of tools and materials; the backlog of finished products, semi-finished products, tools, and raw materials amounted to 5,008,100 yuan, totaling 10,240,000 yuan. Why did the factory turn a blind eye to these serious situations? It is said that completing the task was the priority. Completing the task is proper, but "completing the task" should not be used as an excuse to cancel thrift and condone waste. In September and November 1954, Soviet experts twice gave systematic advice to the Heavy Machinery Plant on the production of cold rolls in the foundry workshop. In order to rush the task, the factory not only did not implement the advice, but also made a decision contrary to the experts' recommendations. As a result, 221 tons of cold rail castings were scrapped, with a rejection rate as high as 81 percent. The Party organization did not strictly criticize these erroneous phenomena ideologically. The only comfort was that "anyway, we completed the production 'task'."

The waste of products in the Dalian Steel Plant under the leadership of the Ministry of Heavy Industry was also serious. In 1954, 983 tons of steel ingots, 1,028 tons of steel, and 885 tons of refractory materials were scrapped. The generation of waste products was mainly due to the leadership giving up the struggle ideologically. From January to November 1954, the steelmaking workshop revised the quantity and specifications of 156 products, which people called "free steelmaking." The leadership not only did not stop this erroneous phenomenon, but decided to pass off unqualified products as qualified products. When the inspectors raised their opinions, they were criticized by the leadership for being "individualistic." Some leading cadres believed that waste products were "inevitable." The Dalian-Lushun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the factory Party committee had inspected the factory's work, but neither had thoroughly criticized or effectively handled these erroneous ideas.

The waste phenomenon at the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory under the leadership of the Ministry of Railways also developed under the dominance of the one-sided idea of "only focusing on production and not paying attention to saving." The lumber workshop did not take materials according to plan or use them according to their quantity and quality, but used large materials for small purposes, used high-quality materials for inferior purposes, did not use hardwood, and did not use second- and third-class materials. The state stipulates that the timber yield of logs is 75 percent, but they only chose the good logs to use, and the logs of slightly inferior quality were thrown aside. Even with such waste, their timber yield only reached 60 percent. This one workshop alone wasted 500,000 yuan of raw materials in 1954, and the production cost exceeded 1 million yuan. The locomotive workshop won the red flag for circular competition and the title of "Excellent Workshop" in 1954, but when evaluating the workshop's production achievements, people ignored its waste. In 1954, the workshop's cost exceeded 230,000 yuan, of which 200,000 yuan was due to the waste of raw materials. Outside the factory, many people picked up garbage from the factory every day, and this "garbage" included small steel, screws, scrap steel, iron edges, etc. According to the comrades of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, each person could pick up 10 to 20 jin of such "garbage" a day. No wonder the workers reflected that the factory was "paved with gold."

As Stalin said at the conference of economic workers in 1931: "In fact, many people in enterprises and economic organizations have long forgotten concepts such as 'saving,' 'reducing unnecessary expenses,' and 'rationalizing production.' They apparently rely on the state bank 'anyway, it will allocate the necessary funds to us.' In fact, the production costs of many enterprises have recently begun to increase."

Wherever there is only focus on production and a forgetting of thrift, two extremely abnormal situations inevitably arise. The first is that production is managed using wasteful methods, which first damages production. The product quality of the Dalian Steel Plant did not improve due to waste, and only 82 percent of the 1954 product variety plan was completed, and more than half of the order contracts could not be delivered on time. Experience in various places has proven that as long as a factory condones waste, it disarms the workers ideologically, and thus it must produce more defective products. The Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory was very wasteful, and there were also many defective products. All 58 vehicles produced in 1954 were unqualified. In October and November alone, the repair costs due to the low quality of the products amounted to 750,000 yuan. Of the 2,879 jigs they produced, 1,235 were defective, but the leadership demanded that the inspectors relax the quality inspection standards. They did not fully complete the state plan for eleven consecutive months.

The second situation is that costs increase, they depend on the bank to survive, and the profit plan cannot be completed. As a result of the waste at the Dalian Steel Plant in 1954, costs increased by 610,000 yuan. The Party committee of a certain factory in Liaoyang inspected and found that the factory's waste was astonishing. According to incomplete statistics from seven units, the backlog of raw materials alone amounted to 12,060,000 yuan. One workshop collected eleven tons of lost metal. The factory's capital turnover was sluggish. The original plan was for a capital turnover of once every 298 days, but it actually reached once every 1,800 days, which is equivalent to a turnover once every five years, so it had to rely on bank credit to survive. In this way, the interest paid to the bank from January to September 1954 amounted to more than 84,000 yuan. The Shenyang Air Compressor Factory produced more than 98,000 defective products from January to October 1954, and the annual profit plan could not be completed, but they used deceptive methods to borrow 750,000 yuan from the bank to pay the profits.

These situations show that those who use production as an excuse and forget thrift have actually forgotten the path of practicing thrift and implementing socialist accumulation that must be taken for China's industrialization. Our heavy industrial factories are the foundation of socialist construction, and the production of factories is by no means for making beautiful reports to superiors, or just for the honor and material interests of the factory. Our production serves the purpose of socialist construction. Therefore, we must not underestimate thrift at any time. We must openly and persistently publicize the idea of ​​thrift, and we must make everyone understand the political and economic significance of thrift.

Strengthening socialist ideological education in Party organizations in enterprises is of great significance for practicing thrift. In the past, although many factories held countless large and small meetings to publicize the general line, many places only stayed at reciting slogans, and did not use the general line as a lighthouse to illuminate the entire production and economic activities of the factory. The Party organization should guarantee and supervise the enterprise's work in striving for accumulation, and it should supervise all economic activities of the enterprise in accordance with the spirit of the general line. The most important thing is to mobilize the workers to conduct a regular struggle to realize thrift and oppose waste. Some Party workers often follow behind some comrades and shout "difficulty" and "no way," and do not seriously inspect the waste phenomenon in accordance with socialist principles. This is not right.

In order to smoothly carry out the anti-waste struggle, the Party and administrative organizations of the factory, after the struggle, establish and implement a thrift system, it is necessary to clarify certain deeply rooted erroneous views. Only by digging out the root of thought can people's minds be clear, remove the blind spots, and consciously practice thrift and oppose waste. This is of great significance for promoting enterprise staff, especially leaders, to deeply understand and master economic activities, ensure that the enterprise does not lose money, and accumulate funds for the country.

### 不能借口“增产”取消节约

　　不能借口“增产”取消节约
　　安岗
    东北不少工厂和工地曾在相当长的时间内流行着这样一种说法：“基本建设早一点投入生产，就是最大的节约”，“增产就是最大的节约”。不少地方在“争取早一天投入生产”、“生产就是一切”等美名下，对浪费现象竟采取了容忍、放纵态度，取消了节约和反浪费的实际斗争。据中共辽宁省委纪律检查委员会和中共沈阳市委纪律检查委员会了解，沈阳重型机器厂在一九五四年中，劣品、废品和停工损失，加上工具材料浪费等所造成的损失共达五百二十三万五千三百多元；成品、半成品、工具和原材料等的积压为五百万八千一百多元，共计一千零二十四万元之多。为什么工厂对这些严重情况熟视无睹呢？据说是因为完成任务要紧。完成任务是应该的，但是不能利用“完成任务”为口实来取消节约，放纵浪费。一九五四年九月和十一月，苏联专家两次到重型机器厂对翻砂车间冷辊生产提出系统的建议。工厂为了赶任务，不仅没有执行，还作出一个同专家建议相反的决定。结果在冷轨铸造上有二百二十一吨产品报废，废品率高达百分之八十一。党的组织对这些错误现象也没有严格地进行思想批判。唯一可以自慰的是“反正我们完成了生产‘任务’”。
    重工业部领导的大连钢厂产品报废的情况也是严重的。一九五四年全年钢锭的废品有九百八十三吨，钢材废品一千零二十八吨，耐火材料废品八百八十五吨。废品的产生主要是由于领导人员在思想上放弃斗争。炼钢车间一九五四年一至十一月就修改了一百五十六种产品的数量和规格，人们把这叫做“自由炼钢”。领导上不但没有制止这种错误现象，反而决定把不合格的产品冒顶合格产品出厂。检查人员提出意见，却受到领导上的批评，说他们是“个人主义”。某些领导干部认为废品是“在所难免的”。中共旅大市委和工厂党委曾检查过工厂工作，但都没有对这些错误思想作彻底批判和有效处理。
    铁道部领导的皇姑屯机车车辆修理工厂的浪费现象也在“只顾生产，不计节约”这种片面性思想支配下发展起来。制材车间不是计划取材，量材使用，而是大材小用，优材劣用，硬木不用，二三等材不用。国家规定原木出材率是百分之七十五，他们只拣好的原木用，质量稍差一点的原木就被扔到一边。就这样浪费，他们的出材率还只达到百分之六十。只这一个车间，一九五四年一年就浪费了五十万元的原材料，生产成本超支一百万元。机车车间是一九五四年获得全厂循环优胜红旗和“优秀车间”称号的，可是人们在评定这个车间的生产成绩时，都忽略了他们的浪费情况。一九五四年车间成本超支了二十三万元，其中原材料的浪费是二十万元。在工厂外边，每天都有很多老百姓拣工厂的垃圾，这些“垃圾”里面有小钢材、螺丝钉、废钢、铁边等。据中共沈阳市纪律检查委员会同志检查，每个老百姓一天能拣十斤到二十斤这样的“垃圾”，无怪乎工人反映工厂“黄金铺地”了。
    正如斯大林在一九三一年经济工作人员会议上所说的：“事实上，有许多企业和经济组织中的人早已忘掉‘节省’、‘减少无谓费用’和‘生产合理化’一类的概念。他们显然是指靠着国家银行‘反正会给我们拨发必需的经费’。事实上有许多企业中的生产成本费近来已开始提高。”
    凡是只顾生产，忘掉节约的地方，都不可避免地出现这样两种极不正常的情况。第一种是，用浪费的办法来经营生产，其结果首先是使生产受到损害。大连钢厂的产品质量并没有因为浪费而有所提高，一九五四年的产品品种计划只完成了百分之八十二，有一半以上的订货合同不能如期交货。各地经验证明：工厂只要放纵浪费，就是在思想上解除了职工的武装，因而也就一定要多出废品。大连工矿车辆厂浪费很严重，废品也很多。一九五四年生产的五十八辆车全部不合格。仅是十月、十一月两月，由于产品质量低劣而花的返修费就达七十五万元。他们生产的二千八百七十九个测架中就有了一千二百三十五个废品，领导上反而要求检查人员放宽质量检查的标准。他们一连十一个月没有全面完成国家计划。
    第二种情况是成本费加大，靠银行过日子，完不成利润计划。大连钢厂一九五四年浪费的结果，成本提高了六十一万元。辽阳某工厂党委会检查，工厂浪费是惊人的，据七个单位不完全统计，仅原材料积压一项即达一千二百零六万元，一个车间收集了十一吨被丢失的金属。工厂资金周转不灵，原计划资金周转是二百九十八天一次，实际达到一千八百天一次，等于五年周转一次，只得靠银行信贷过日子。这样一九五四年从一月到九月付给银行的利息就达八万四千多元。沈阳空气压缩机厂一九五四年
  一月至十月生产了九万八千余件废品，全年利润计划完不成，可是他们却用欺骗办法向银行贷款七十五万元来补缴利润。
    这些情况表明：那些借口生产、忘记节约的人，他们实际上忘记了为了我国的工业化而必须走的厉行节约，实行社会主义积累的道路。我们的重工业工厂是社会主义建设的基础，工厂的生产绝不是为了给上级作美妙的报告，或只是为了本厂的荣誉和物质利益。我们的生产是为社会主义建设的目的服务。因此，我们在任何时候都不能轻视节约。我们必须公开地持久地宣传节约的思想，要使每一个人都懂得节约的政治和经济的意义。
    企业中党组织加强社会主义的思想教育工作，对厉行节约有重要的意义。过去尽管有不少工厂开过无数次的大会和小会来宣传总路线，但很多地方只是停留在背诵口号上，而没有把总路线当作灯塔来照亮工厂的整个生产经济活动。党组织应当对企业争取积累的工作实行保证和监督，要依据总路线的精神来监督企业的全部经济活动，其中最重要的是发动工人为实现节约反对浪费进行经常的斗争。有些党的工作者常常跟在某些同志的后边喊“困难”、“没办法”，而没有按照社会主义的原则来认真检查浪费现象。这是不对的。
    工厂的党和行政组织为着顺利地进行反浪费斗争，经过斗争建立并执行节约制度，必须澄清某些错误的根深蒂固的看法，只有挖出思想的根子，才能使人们头脑清醒起来，去掉盲目病，自觉地实行节约，反对浪费。这对于推动企业工作人员，特别是领导者来深入地了解和掌握经济活动，保证企业不亏损，为国家积累资金具有重要的意义。
