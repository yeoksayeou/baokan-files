The phenomenon of grain sales exceeding the plan can be avoided
E Sheng

In many regions, grain sales have greatly exceeded the reasonable targets set by the state, and an increasing number of farmers are clamoring for “grain shortages” and demanding supplies. Some rural work cadres believe that this problem can only be solved by allocating more grain and increasing the supply. Facts have proven that this view is wrong.

According to a report from the CCP Xiangyang Prefectural Committee to the Hubei Provincial Committee on April 16th: The daily grain sales in the Xiangyang area exceed the highest number of last year; in some townships, up to 80% of households are clamoring for supply. The reasons for this situation are, first, shortcomings in the work of certain counties, and second, the Prefectural Committee believes that the unified purchase and sale work last year was done quite well, leading to complacency. However, it can be stated with certainty that this situation is a false phenomenon.

Why are so many people clamoring that they don't have enough grain to eat? The main reason is that the masses have ideological concerns. Many farmers believe that "whoever asks for grain is honorable," and they are afraid of suffering losses in the future if they don't ask for grain. Some cadres, in order to “take the initiative,” conducted a “fact-finding” mission, registration, and made promises, thus forming a phenomenon of everyone reporting and the more they looked into it, the more people asked for grain. Without distinguishing between truth and falsehood, they issued grain coupons; once issued, even more people wanted them. District cadres spoke vaguely about "three fixings," while the masses were clamoring for supplies. Some cadres were at a loss and lost confidence in reversing this situation.

There are many loopholes in the grain supply work. The number of cooked food businesses is gradually increasing, and many of them are speculating, selling cooked food, and selling supply coupons. On the construction site of the Heilongyan Reservoir in Xiangyang, there are 72 vendors selling steamed buns every day. In Nizu Street, seven cooked food businesses opened without approval and without a grain supply. In Zhangwan District, two households claimed to be short of fifty to sixty catties of grain, but after being supplied with grain, they used the supply grain coupons to make steamed bun business. This household caused more than 30 households in the entire bay to make trouble. The Party branch secretary, deputy township head, and Youth League branch secretary of Jianshe Township in Oumiao District were selling grain coupons and dividing the profits; in the bay where the branch secretary lived, 25 of the 59 households had opened businesses selling millet wine. In Qiaowan Township, Xinye County, Henan Province, more than 400 of the 800 households in the entire township were using Xiangyang grain coupons to purchase grain in Xiangyang. A boatman bought 70 catties of noodles to do business. This phenomenon is widespread in the area.

In summary, there are many problems and many loopholes.奸商 (cunning merchants) are causing trouble, selling grain coupons and cooked food, creating a black market, and taking the opportunity to attack us. The more households that do not sell grain thoroughly, the more they make trouble. Bad elements are taking the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage. However, many cadres cannot correctly recognize these situations and are blinded by false appearances. Some responsible comrades in counties, districts, and townships do not calmly analyze the actual situation, cannot figure out whether the "tense" situation is false or real, and just reach out to the higher authorities for grain. They mistakenly believe that as long as the supply is increased, the "tense" phenomenon can be eliminated. As a result, the problem becomes more and more serious.

In order to solve this problem, the CCP Xiangyang Prefectural Committee held a meeting on April 10th in Huopai Township, Xiangyang, the focus of the Prefectural Committee's work. The meeting was attended by members of the Prefectural Committee, members of the CCP Xiangyang County Committee, district committee secretaries of Xiangyang County, and some township party branch secretaries. At this meeting, the issue of how to understand and treat the current grain supply work was better resolved.

At this meeting, the person in charge of the Huopai Township branch gave a report on solving the grain supply problem.

The first problem encountered by Huopai Township in implementing the grain "three fixings" policy and the mutual aid and cooperation policy was the fairly common demand for grain supply from the masses. Only three of the 32 households in Gaoying Village did not want to supply; 68 of the 73 households in Wanzi Village wanted to supply; 35 of the 48 households in Dianzi Village wanted to supply; and 27 of the 67 households in Huopai Village wanted to supply. The Huopai Township branch conducted an investigation and study of this situation. Based on the results of the investigation, in addition to a very small number of households that were truly short of grain, the vast majority belonged to the following three situations: First, not only were they not short, but they also had surplus grain, accounting for one-third; second, they had enough to eat, accounting for one-third; third, some people were slightly short, but they could manage if they were frugal. They wanted to supply mainly because they misunderstood the policy, had concerns, and were afraid of buying too much this year and of others borrowing grain, so they first "registered" with the cadres, indicating that they did not have much grain and that they had sold all their surplus grain. One middle peasant, who had not sold 600 catties of grain during the unified purchase last year, insisted on grain coupons, and the township cadres issued him 300 catties of supply coupons; another middle peasant also supplied without selling grain thoroughly. However, these two households are now making the most noise, saying that "they are so hungry that they cannot straighten their waists." The supply problem was stirred up by these people, while the truly grain-short households still have grain coupons left. That is to say, those who should have been supplied last year have all been supplied, and some who should not have been supplied have also been supplied. In response to these situations, the branch, on the one hand, publicized the grain "three fixings" policy, and on the other hand, enlightened the masses to calculate accounts and compare, organized discussions, and dispelled the masses' concerns. After doing this, many farmers said: "My grain is enough. I was just a little worried before, but I didn't really want grain." Some farmers also said, "It will be enough if I am frugal." The number of households requesting supply in Dianzi Village decreased from 35 to 2; the number of households requesting supply in Huopai Village was verified to be 3 out of 27. The original demand for supply accounted for more than 70% of the total number of households in the township; now, after verification, only 10% are truly short of grain and need to be supplied.

Based on the experience of Huopai Township, the CCP Xiangyang County Committee studied the basic situation of grain supply in the county. Is the fact that so many households are demanding grain supply because the unified purchase work last year deviated and caused the masses to sell their rations? Or is it a false phenomenon? The fact is: more was purchased in the key townships last year; but after inspection, the grain was immediately returned according to the situation, and the problem has been solved. The second batch of townships implemented the policy well, and the problem was not significant. The third batch of townships purchased even less. Last year, most townships summarized the unified purchase and sale work, further promoted democracy in the summary, and after each household made a decision, the "four retentions" were achieved, ensuring the supply. This shows that the problem does not lie in the deviation of the unified purchase work last year that caused the masses to sell their rations. Who is the most clamorous for supply at present? Most of them are middle peasants, especially wealthy middle peasants. This proves that the current supply demand is basically a false phenomenon, which is caused by the misunderstanding of the unified purchase and sale policy by some farmers. In this way, everyone realized that political education work should be strengthened to solve this problem, and that the supply of grain should not be blindly increased. Then, the district committee and branch secretaries attending the meeting also used this method to conduct specific analysis, clarify the nature of the problem, clear their minds, and unify their thinking.

The meeting further studied how to solve the problem of the masses demanding supply. It focused on studying the experience of Huopai Township. Everyone believed that since the "supply demand" is basically a false phenomenon, which is due to misunderstandings about the policy, then the main way to solve this problem is to do a good job in political work: First, in the branch, inspire party members to recall the grain unified purchase work last year and unify their thinking; then, among the masses, on the one hand, deeply publicize the grain "three fixings" policy, resolve farmers' ideological concerns, and shatter rumors, and on the other hand, adopt methods of recalling the unified purchase work last year and specific accounting, as well as real people, real events, and on-site comparison, to clarify the false phenomenon of demanding more supply. At the same time, the problems of the few who are truly short of grain must be solved in a practical manner in order to stabilize their production emotions.

The Prefectural Committee decided that the current phenomenon of grain sales exceeding the plan must be overcome. On the one hand, it is necessary to prevent the waste of grain and the purchase of grain by cooked food businesses, and also to inspect the waste of grain by organs and towns, severely crack down on the activities of奸商 (cunning merchants), and punish individual speculators and vendors selling grain. More importantly, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education work, persuade farmers in a one-on-one manner, and call on them to save grain, tide over the spring famine, prevent the summer famine, and use the money for production; it is also necessary to actively lead the national grain market so that farmers can adjust the variety of grain. It is required that each county make the daily sales not exceed the plan in the shortest period of time on the basis of doing a good job. The work is difficult; but judging from the recent situation of Huopai supply station, it is entirely possible. The daily sales of this station from April 11th to 15th decreased by 34% compared with the daily sales in early April, and continues to decline.

At present, production has reached a tense season, and it is absolutely impossible to publicize the "three fixings" and solve the supply problem in isolation. It is necessary to guide the masses to the production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, and at the same time solve the grain supply problem.

　　粮食销售超过计划的现象是可以避免的
　　鄂生
    许多地区粮食销量大大超过了国家规定的合理的指标，叫喊“缺粮”要求供应的农民越来越多。有些农村工作干部认为只有多拨粮食，增加供应数量才能解决这个问题。事实证明，这种看法是错误的。
    据中共襄阳地委四月十六日给湖北省委的报告：襄阳地区粮食每天的销量超过去年的最高数；有些乡吵闹供应的户达到百分之八十。发生这种情况的原因，一是某些县工作上有缺点，再是地委认为去年统购统销工作做的还不错，有麻痹思想。但是，可以肯定地讲，这种情况是一种虚假现象。
    为什么许多人都吵着粮食不够吃呢？主要原因是群众有思想顾虑。许多农民认为“谁要粮食谁光荣”，不要粮食怕以后吃亏。有些干部为了
  “争取主动”，来了个“摸底”、登记、许愿，于是形成一报都报，越摸越多的现象。还没有辨清真假，就向下发粮票；一发，要的就更多了。区干部空洞地讲“三定”，群众却在一边闹供应。有些干部就束手无策，失去扭转这个局面的信心。
    粮食供应工作的漏洞很大。熟食业户日渐增加，其中不少户进行投机，贩熟食，贩供应票。襄阳黑龙堰水库工地上，每天有七十二个卖馍的。泥咀街上有七户熟食业未经批准也没供应粮食就开了张。张湾区有两户叫喊缺粮五六十斤，供应粮食以后，却拿着供应粮票做馍馍生意。由这一户引起全湾子三十多户都闹。欧庙区建设乡党支部书记、副乡长、团支部书记三个人贩卖粮票，赚的钱合伙分；支部书记住的那个湾子五十九户，已有二十五户开张卖稷子酒。河南新野县桥湾乡全乡八百户就有四百多户拿着襄阳粮票到襄阳套购粮食。有一个船民买走七十斤面条做生意。这种现象在当地普遍存在着。
    总起来说，问题很多，漏洞很大。奸商捣鬼，贩卖粮票熟食，制造黑市，乘机向我们进攻。越是卖粮不彻底的户，越是闹的凶。坏分子乘机造谣破坏。可是，许多干部不能正确地认识这些情况，被假象蒙蔽着。有些县、区、乡的负责同志没有冷静分析实际情况，摸不清“紧张”情况是虚是实，只是伸手向上面要粮食。他们误以为只要增加供应量，就可以消除“紧张”现象。结果，问题越闹越大。
    为了解决这个问题，中共襄阳地委于四月十日在地委工作重点襄阳伙牌乡召开了一个会议。参加会议的有地委委员、中共襄阳县委委员、襄阳县各区区委书记和一部分乡党支部书记。在这次会议上，较好地解决了如何认识和对待当前粮食供应工作的问题。
    在这次会议上，伙牌乡支部负责人做了解决粮食供应问题的报告。
    伙牌乡在贯彻粮食“三定”政策和互助合作政策中，首先遇到的一个问题，就是群众相当普遍地要求供应粮食。郜营村三十二户中只有三户没有要供应；湾子村七十三户中有六十八户要供应；店子村四十八户中有三十五户要供应；伙牌村六十七户中有二十七户要供应。伙牌乡支部对这种情况作了调查研究。根据调查的结果来分析，要供应的除了很少数是真正缺粮户外，绝大部分属于这样三种情况：第一、不但不缺，而且有余粮的，有三分之一；第二、够吃的，有三分之一；第三、有一些人稍缺一点，但是节约一点也就够了。他们要供应，主要是对政策有误解，有顾虑，怕今年多购，怕别人借粮，因此先向干部“挂个号”，表示自己的粮食不多，表示余粮已卖彻底。一个中农，去年统购时还有六百斤粮食未卖出，他也硬要粮票，乡干部又发给他三百斤供应票；另一户中农也是卖粮不彻底又供应了。可是，现在这两户闹的最厉害，说“饿的腰都直不起啦”。供应问题就是这些人吵起来的，而真正的缺粮户粮票还有余。这就是说，去年该供应的都供应了，有些不该供应的也供应了。针对这些情况，支部一方面宣传粮食的“三定”政策，一方面启发群众算账对比，组织讨论，解除群众的顾虑。这样做了以后，许多农民都说：“我的粮食够了。原来是有点顾虑，不是真要粮。”也有的农民表示“节约点把就够了”。店子村要求供应的由三十五户减到了两户；伙牌村要供应的由二十七户核实为三户。全乡原来要求供应的占总户数百分之七十以上；现在经过核实，只有百分之十真正缺粮，需要供应。
    根据伙牌乡的经验，中共襄阳县委研究了全县粮食供应的基本情况。目前这么多户要求供应粮食，究竟是因为去年统购工作有偏差使群众卖了口粮？还是虚假现象？事实是：去年重点乡购的多了一点；但经过检查后，立即据情退了粮，问题已经解决了。第二批乡政策执行得好，问题不大。第三批乡购得更少。去年绝大部分乡都总结了统购统销工作，在总结中进一步发扬民主，经过家家定案，做到了“四留”，保证了供应。这说明问题并不在于去年统购工作有偏差使群众卖了口粮。当前要供应最厉害的是什么人？大部分是中农，特别是富裕中农。这就证明，目前闹供应基本上是个虚假现象，是由于部分农民对统购统销政策误解所产生的。这样一来，大家都认识到应加强政治教育工作去解决这个问题，而不应盲目向上面要求增加粮食供应量。接着，参加会议的区委和支部书记，也采用这样的办法，进行了具体分析，弄清了问题的性质，清醒了头脑，统一了思想认识。
    这次会议进一步研究了如何解决群众要供应的问题。着重研究了伙牌乡的经验。大家认为：既然“闹供应”基本是个虚假现象，是由于对政策有误解，那末解决这个问题的主要办法就是做好政治工作：首先，在支部里启发党员回忆去年粮食统购工作，统一思想；然后，在群众中一方面深入宣传粮食的
  “三定”政策，解决农民的思想顾虑，粉碎谣言，另一方面采用回忆去年统购工作和具体算账的办法，以及真人真事、现场对比的方法，澄清多要供应的虚假现象。同时，对于少数真正缺粮的必须切实解决他们的问题，以稳定他们的生产情绪。
    地委决定：一定要克服目前粮食销售超过计划的现象。一方面，要防止熟食业浪费粮食和套购粮食，还要检查机关、镇城浪费粮食现象，严厉打击奸商的活动，对个别投机贩卖粮食小贩也应予以惩处。更重要的一方面是加强思想教育工作，用个别串连的方式说服农民，要号召节约粮食，渡过春荒，预防夏荒，把钱用到生产上；还要积极领导国家粮食市场，以便农民进行粮食品种的调剂。要求各县在最短期限内在做好工作的基础上使日销量不超过计划，工作是有困难的；但从伙牌供应站的最近情况看，是完全能够做到的。这个站四月十一日到十五日的日销量较四月上旬的日销量下降了百分之三十四，仍在继续下降。
    当前生产已到紧张季节，绝不能孤立地宣传
  “三定”和解决供应问题，必须把群众引导到以互助合作为中心的生产运动上来，同时解决粮食供应问题。
