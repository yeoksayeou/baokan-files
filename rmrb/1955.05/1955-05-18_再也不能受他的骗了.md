The People's Daily of May 13th, when it arrived in Taiyuan, caused our comrades at the Shanxi Medical College to feel that Hu Feng was very dishonest after reading his "My Self-Criticism." Between the lines, he carried a defiant air, and it seemed more like he was defending himself rather than criticizing himself. For example, he said, "'Where there is life, there is struggle' This argument. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas at the time, reflecting the spontaneous resistance demands of the working people in literary works should have had practical significance,... My mistake was that when I affirmed these efforts, I did not emphatically point out the limitations of these works.” Isn't this tortuously affirming his own argument? Isn't this an attempt to prove to the readers that he had no mistakes in the first place? Doesn't this equate to saying that proposing the slogan "Where there is life, there is struggle" in the Kuomintang-controlled areas had "practical significance"? It was only that these works had some "limitations." But we know that the proposal of this slogan was precisely a method of Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people actions. He used this slogan to prevent young intellectuals from joining the revolutionary ranks. This slogan found a beautiful excuse for those who wanted to revolt but were afraid of revolution. This was by no means just a matter of the slogan causing some "limitations" in certain literary works, but objectively, it had a great destructive effect on the revolutionary cause for young intellectuals.

If Hu Feng truly wants to examine himself, I hope he will examine his consistent anti-Party and anti-people behavior in the past, and how he painstakingly promoted bourgeois individualism.

Hu Feng has also given a new explanation for the "subjective fighting spirit." He said: "The writer must have a position of sharing the fate of the people, an attitude of love and hate towards enemies, friends, and ourselves in the actual struggle, and a revolutionary humanitarian spirit." Without even discussing whether this explanation is correct, just based on the partial materials provided by Shu Wu, this is purely self-deceiving nonsense. Hu Feng has consistently and viciously opposed the Party's leadership over the literary and artistic movement, opposed the literary and artistic team composed of the Party and non-Party writers, and actively carried out his own anti-Party clique activities. He had one face in public and another in private. He called revolutionary comrades and communists "officials," "masters," and "nobles." He called progressive literary and artistic workers "maggots." Can these be called "attitudes of love and hate toward enemies, friends, and ourselves"? Mumbling behind people's backs and smiling to their faces, can this be considered a "revolutionary humanitarian spirit"? Give it a rest, stop pretending!

When Hu Feng began his self-criticism, he hurriedly put on the hat of a revolutionary petty bourgeoisie. But is the petty bourgeoisie that leans towards revolution like this? In the past, during the struggle to overthrow the three major enemies, and in today's socialist construction, what has Hu Feng done? Is he opposing our enemies? How does he treat the people and the Party? Just as he himself said in the past, it is all "rebellious sounds from a disloyal heart." He called the Party's ideological leadership over literature and art "a mechanistic ruling force," and called on the people in his clique to "spend a little more effort" to "shake" it from the root. He was superficially perfunctory to the Party (i.e., what he called the "officialdom"), but in reality, he would never "compromise." He only had hatred for the revolutionary literary and artistic team composed of Party and non-Party progressive writers. He said, "A blade of grass is nourished by a drop of dew, but this will absolutely, absolutely not come from those various philistines." He treated comrades inside and outside the Party with an attitude of "smiling with contempt." Is this the attitude of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie? "If it were not for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I personally would not have found a place to settle down for more than 20 years." These nice-sounding words are now only enough to prove Hu Feng's hypocrisy, and we can no longer be deceived by him.

　　再也不能受他的骗了
    蒋维祥
    五月十三日的人民日报到了太原的时候，我们山西医学院的同志们看了胡风的“我的自我批判”以后，都觉得他很不老实。字里行间带着不服气的劲头，与其说是批判自己，不如说是替自己辩解。比如，他说“‘哪里有生活，哪里就有斗争’这一论点。在当时的国民党统治区，在文艺作品里反映劳动人民底自发的反抗要求，应该是具有现实意义的，……我的错误在于，我在肯定这些努力的时候，没有强调地指出这些作品底局限性。”这不是曲曲折折地在肯定自己的论点吗？这不是企图向读者证明自己原来就没有什么错误吗？这不等于说，在国民党统治区提出“哪里有生活，哪里就有斗争”的口号来，是具有“现实意义”的吗？只是这些作品有一些
  “局限性”罢了。可是我们知道，这个口号的提出，正是胡风的反党反人民的一种手法。他用这个口号来阻止青年知识分子投到革命队伍中去。这个口号替那些又想革命、又怕革命的人，找到一个漂亮的借口。这决不是像胡风所说，这个口号只是使某些文艺作品有了什么“局限性”的缺点的问题，而是在客观上使青年知识分子对于革命事业起着一个极大的破坏作用的问题。
    胡风如果真想检讨，我希望他就过去一贯的反党反人民的行为、他怎样处心积虑地宣传资产阶级个人主义思想来进行检查。
    胡风对于“主观战斗精神”又有了新的解释。他说：“作家必须有和人民共命运的立场，在现实斗争中对于敌、友、我的爱爱仇仇的态度，革命的人道主义精神。”先不讨论这种解释是否对，仅仅根据舒芜所提出的部分材料来看，这纯粹是一种自欺欺人的胡说。胡风一贯恶毒地反对党对文艺运动的领导，反对党和党外作家所组成的文艺队伍，积极地进行自己的反党集团活动。表面一套，背后一套。把革命同志、共产党员称呼为“官们”，“老爷们”，“权贵”。把进步文艺工作者称为“蛆虫”。这一些还能称它是“对于敌、友、我的爱爱仇仇的态度”吗？背后骂人，当面微笑，这能算是“革命的人道主义精神”吗？算了吧，别再装模作样了！
    胡风一开始进行自我批判的时候，赶紧给自己戴上一顶革命小资产阶级的帽子。可是倾向革命的小资产阶级是这样的吗？在过去打倒三大敌人的斗争的时期，在进行社会主义建设的今天，试看胡风的所作所为是什么呢？他反对的是我们的敌人吗？他又怎样对待人民、对待党呢？正如他自己过去所说过的一句话，倒尽是些“发自贰心的叛逆之音”。他把党对文艺的思想领导称为“机械论的统治势力”，号召他的小集团中的人，要“多花一点力气”把它从根“动摇”。他对于党（即他所说的
  “官方”）是表面上敷衍、实际上决不“妥协”的。对于党和非党进步作家所组成的革命文艺队伍是只有仇恨的感情的。他说“一根草有一粒露水养，只不过这绝对又绝对地不会从那些各种各样的市侩们得来”。却“用微笑包着侮蔑”的态度来对待党和党外的同志们。这是革命的小资产阶级的态度吗？“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的。”这些动听的话现在都只足以证明胡风的口是心非，我们再也不能受他的骗了。
