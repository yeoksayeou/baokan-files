Here are three projected figures: one is the proportion of the output value of China's modern industry in the total output value of industry and agriculture, which has risen from 17 percent in 1949 to 33 percent in 1954; one is the proportion of the output value of means of production in the total industrial output value, which has risen from 28.8 percent in 1949 to 42.3 percent in 1954; and the other is the proportion of the output value of state-owned, cooperative-operated, and joint state-private industrial enterprises in the total industrial output value, which has risen from 37 percent in 1949 to 71 percent in 1954.

These are extraordinary figures, indicating that our country is advancing victoriously on the road of socialist industrialization, which is the result of the heroic labor of the Chinese people, especially the Chinese working class.

In the first four months of 1955, workers worked even harder to realize the country's plans. In the first quarter, more than 6,000 unit projects have already started in the six central industrial ministries. The new construction projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have begun, and half of the equipment needed for the whole year has been transported to Anshan from nearly one hundred factories in more than twenty large cities at home and abroad. The construction of the new massive steel base is becoming increasingly tense. The construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has started a month earlier than last year. The construction of the first tractor factory will also start soon. On the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, a massive construction force of 150,000 laborers has launched a comprehensive construction effort, and hundreds of cars printed with the railway emblem are speeding along the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway. Nearly a thousand wooden boats with small red flags bearing the railway symbol are breaking waves along the Jialing River, transporting large amounts of materials to the construction site every day. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will complete the foundation work of four piers this year, and workers are actively preparing for the start of construction. In Beijing, basic construction projects with a construction area of more than one million square meters have started one after another. The No. 2 State Cotton Factory has just installed the last textile machine, and the construction of the factory building of the No. 3 State Cotton Factory has started next.

In terms of production, the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry overfulfilled the plan for five major products in the first quarter: iron ore, metallurgical coke, pig iron, steel, and rolled steel products. The output of national state-owned coal mines in the first quarter also greatly exceeded the plan. Miners in Fushun, the coal capital, have successively broken the already raised labor quotas. Many advanced workers across the country and the teams they led began to complete their May workload in April. In the past few months, new factories built with Soviet assistance, such as Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant and Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, have officially started production.

The construction of our country achieves new accomplishments every day; these accomplishments are exchanged for workers’ selfless labor. Increasingly widespread labor emulation campaigns have organized workers’ enthusiasm. In 1950, more than 600,000 workers across the country participated in labor emulation campaigns. In 1954, more than 600,000 workers in Shandong and Hebei provinces alone participated in labor emulation campaigns. In 1954, the total number of employees participating in labor emulation campaigns in Shenyang increased by 22.5 percent compared with 1953. The organizational forms of labor emulation campaigns are also becoming increasingly diversified. There are inter-factory competitions between factories, mobile red flag competitions between workshops and work sections, and teams, same-trade competitions between identical trades, competitions by youth shock brigades or youth production teams and groups that suit the characteristics of young workers, and no-stop competitions at intermediate stations in railway transportation to meet the needs of specific production. These diverse labor emulation campaigns have differentiated the characteristics of different objects and different needs and have better brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of workers. In 1954, more than 370,000 labor models, model workers, and advanced workers were selected by grassroots units.

The people building the Kangzang Highway loudly shouted: "Let the high mountains bow their heads and the rivers make way." Only heroes can utter such magnificent words. However, in our country, it is not only on the Kangzang Highway that there are such heroes and such heroic verses; in every construction site and every factory across the country, there are such heroes and such heroic spirit. In the Northeast, according to the original overall progress plan, the construction project of a thermal power plant was planned to be suspended in winter. Later, when the weather turned cold, the workers prepared to stop work. At this time, in order to supply power to other important projects in the area in advance, the state decided to organize winter construction to speed up the progress of the project. As soon as the news arrived, the workers unhesitatingly gave up their plans to return home, quickly completed the preparations, and began large-scale winter construction. At that time, it was the day when water dripped into ice. The huge concrete project was continued using steam heating, and the workers worked in the howling wind in the high altitude. At night, it snowed heavily, and the construction site was brightly lit by electric lights, and steam swirled in the light like a mist. The workers worked in such a situation, as if they had forgotten that it was night and that it was winter. After the winter construction this year, the tall factory buildings stood up, and the amount of work completed during the winter construction greatly exceeded the amount of work completed before the winter construction.

The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway has to pass through a desert area. The desert in this area is like a sand mountain, with an undulation difference of 20 meters. China has not built railways in the desert before. Can the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway pass through here? In order to uncover this mystery, the Third Survey and Design Team of the Northwest Design Branch of the Ministry of Railways accepted the suggestion of Soviet experts and sent six employees to the desert to establish a desert observation station. These six people came to the desert and saw only yellow sand rolling, and there were almost no people within dozens of kilometers around, only a temple. There were no monks or statues in this temple, as if the Bodhisattva could not bear the suffering in this desert and moved away. The six people stayed in the temple and started the work of the desert observation station. They studied how much rain there was in the desert, how fast the wind was, how much sand was moving, whether plants could grow, and where the boundary of the desert was. Although life in the desert was very hard, and the work of the observation station was unfamiliar to them, they overcame the difficulties and persisted. These six people, and those who were later sent to the observation station to support them, were all ordinary people. They were not known at home for new records or the latest creations, but their labor, like the creators of other new records and the innovators of technology, is a guarantee for the country’s increasingly advanced construction.

The workers' ability to achieve rapid progress in the country's construction is inseparable from the emphasis on learning and mastering new technologies, striving to improve and improve technology in labor emulation campaigns, and especially from the emphasis on conscientiously learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Our country's past industry was backward, and the technical level of workers was relatively low. After the planned economic construction began, the number of new workers increased, and the average technical level of workers decreased. However, the factories we built, especially the 156 projects that the Soviet Union helped our country build, all adopted the most advanced technology and equipment. Only through conscientious study can we master these new technologies.

Who can tell how thick an ordinary newspaper is? Newspapers, in the eyes of the naked eye and in people's concepts, are the thinnest things, and it seems impossible to calculate their thickness. However, the error of the most sophisticated measuring tools produced by the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant can only be equal to one-thousandth of the thickness of a newspaper. It sounds like a myth. But we must master such precise technology. This is not an easy task.

As early as the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, Comrade Mao Zedong called for launching a nationwide upsurge in learning from the Soviet Union. He said: "We are going to carry out great national construction, the work before us is arduous, and our experience is not enough. Therefore, we must conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union." According to this instruction, workers in labor emulation campaigns paid special attention to learning from the Soviet Union and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. As of 1954, according to incomplete statistics, workers in various industries had promoted more than 600 advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and from our own country. In 1954, more than 950,000 people participated in the study of various technical schools, technical research associations, and technical training classes. Many factories have sent interns to the Soviet Union to learn from Soviet workers.

Today, although the technical level of workers is still lagging behind the needs of the country, it has improved significantly compared with the past. In 1954, employees across the country put forward more than 840,000 rationalization proposals in production, of which more than 460,000 have been adopted. China's machinery industry has been able to manufacture nearly 2,000 relatively important products. Not long ago, China's first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine was completed in Shanghai. Dalian Metrology Instrument Factory has produced a most precise electric balance. It weighs 19 kilograms, consists of 854 parts, the smallest part is the size of a grain of millet, and weighs only one milligram. This balance can weigh the weight of an object the size of a quarter of a match head.

Workers not only strive to complete the country's construction plans and production plans with good quality, but also wage a relentless struggle against all kinds of waste in order to practice thrift, increase the country's socialist capital accumulation. In 1954, the production cost of the Ministry of Heavy Industry was reduced by about 3 percent compared with the national plan, and the cost reduction of basic construction also overfulfilled the national plan, with the cost reduction rate reaching 9 percent of the total contracted value. Many models who are good at saving production have emerged in factories and mining enterprises. Guo Shaotian, an old worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, is one of them. He spent a lot of time buried in the so-called scrap iron piles, picking up a lot of useful equipment. In 1953, when Guo Shaotian and others repaired a certain blast furnace, all the pipelines and spare parts were found in the scrap pile without using any new materials. In 1954, when a certain blast furnace in the factory was repaired, it was suddenly discovered that the platform channel iron under the large lever was burned and bent. Because there was no plan to repair it, there were no materials for a while, and it seemed that the time for medium repair would be extended, and the monthly plan of the blast furnace would fall through. At this time, Guo Shaotian brought the materials he had picked up from the scrap pile and solved the problem immediately.

The achievements of the Chinese working class in the country's construction are inseparable from the support of the people of the whole country, especially the support of the peasants. The vast number of peasants not only supply grain and non-staple food, and not only supply raw materials for light industry, but also directly participate in industrial or transportation construction in many places. In the 1954 project of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, more than 20,000 migrant workers in Shaanxi Province directly participated in road construction, and the province supplied more than 25,000 cubic meters of engineering timber. The peasants along the route expanded the planting area of ​​thousands of acres of vegetables to meet the needs of road construction workers. In the days of continuous rain and heavy snow, the peasants along the route still insisted on going to the mountains to cut firewood and supplying fuel to the employees and their families on time. This kind of fraternal support is commonplace on every construction site and in every factory. It inspires workers to make greater efforts to complete the country's plans.

On the "May Day" International Labor Day in 1955, Chinese workers can proudly recall the past and will continue to work tirelessly to realize the great ideal of socialist industrialization.

    我国工人为国家的社会主义工业化而奋斗
　　范荣康
    这里有三个预计数字：一个是中国现代工业的产值在工农业总产值中的比重，已由一九四九年的百分之十七上升到一九五四年的百分之三十三；一个是生产资料的产值在工业总产值中的比重，已由一九四九年的百分之二十八点八上升到一九五四年的百分之四十二点三；一个是国营、合作社营和公私合营工业的产值在工业总产值中的比重，已由一九四九年的百分之三十七上升到一九五四年的百分之七十一。
    这是些不平常的数字，它表明我们的国家正在社会主义工业化的道路上胜利前进，它是中国人民特别是中国工人阶级英勇劳动的结果。
    在一九五五年的最初四个月里，工人们以更大的努力实现国家的计划。第一季度，中央六个工业部已有六千多件单位工程开工了。鞍山钢铁公司的新的建设工程已经开始，全年所需要的设备已有半数从国外和国内的二十几个大城市的近一百个工厂运到鞍山。新的巨大的钢铁基地的建设工作日益紧张。第一汽车制造厂的建设工程已比去年提前一个月开始施工。第一个拖拉机制造厂的厂房工程很快也可以开始了。宝成铁路上已有十五万劳动大军展开了全面的施工，数百辆印有铁路路徽的汽车奔驰在川陕公路上。近千只插有铁路标志小红旗的木船沿着嘉陵江破浪前进，每天都把大量的物资运到工地。武汉长江大桥将在今年完成四个桥墩基础工程，工人们正积极准备迎接开工。在北京，已有一百多万平方公尺建筑面积的基本建设工程陆续开工，国棉二厂刚刚安装了最后一台纺织机，国棉三厂的厂房工程又接着开工了。
    在生产方面，第一季度重工业部钢铁工业管理局的铁矿石、冶金焦、生铁、钢、钢压延品等五种主要产品都超额完成了计划。全国国营煤矿第一季度的产量也大大超过了计划。煤都抚顺的矿工们纷纷突破已经提高了的劳动定额。全国许多先进工人和他们所带领的小组在四月份就开始去完成五月份的工作量。过去几个月中，已有哈尔滨量具刃具厂、沈阳风动工具厂等苏联帮助建设的新的工厂正式开工投入生产。
    我们国家的建设，每一天都有新的成就；这些成就是工人们用忘我的劳动换来的。越来越广泛的劳动竞赛把工人们的热情组织起来。一九五零年，全国有六十多万工人参加劳动竞赛，一九五四年仅山东、河北两省就有六十多万工人参加劳动竞赛。沈阳市一九五四年参加劳动竞赛的职工总数比一九五三年增加了百分之二十二点五。劳动竞赛的组织形式也越来越丰富了。厂和厂之间有厂际竞赛，车间和车间、工段和工段、小组和小组之间有流动红旗竞赛，相同的工种之间有同工种竞赛，适应青年工人的特点，有青年突击队或青年生产班、组的竞赛，适应具体生产的需要，在铁路运输中还有中间站不停车竞赛。这些多种多样的劳动竞赛，区别了不同对象，不同需要的特点，更好地发挥了工人的积极性和创造性。一九五四年，经基层单位评选出的劳动模范、模范工作者和先进工作者就有三十七万多人。
    建设康藏公路的人们响亮地喊出：“让高山低头，叫河水让路。”只有英雄们才能吐出这样气吞山河的壮语。可是，在我们的国家里，不只是康藏公路上有这样的英雄，有这样英雄的诗句，在全国的每一个工地和每一个工厂里，都有这样的英雄，都有这样的英雄气概。在东北，一个火力发电厂的建设工程根据原订的总进度计划，冬季是准备停工的。后来，天气冷下来了，工人们准备休工了。这时，国家为了提前给这个地区的其他重要工程供电，决定组织冬季施工，加快工程进度。消息一到，工人们毫不犹豫地放弃自己回家的计划，迅速完成了准备工作，开始了大规模的冬季施工。那时候，正是滴水成冰的日子，巨大的混凝土工程用蒸汽加热法继续进行，工人们在朔风怒吼的高空作业。晚上，大雪纷纷，工地被电灯照得雪亮，蒸汽像薄雾一样在灯光中袅袅盘旋。工人们就在这样的情况下工作着，好像忘记了这是晚上，忘记了这是冬天。这一年冬季施工结束后，高大的厂房竖立起来，冬季施工中完成的工作量大大超过了冬季施工前已完成的工作量。
    包兰铁路要经过一段沙漠地带。这一带的沙漠像沙山一样，起伏高差达二十公尺。中国还没有在沙漠中修过铁路，包兰铁路能够从这里通过吗？为了揭开这个迷底，铁道部西北设计分局第三勘测设计总队接受苏联专家的建议，派了六个职工到沙漠上去建立一个沙漠观测站。这六个人来到沙漠上，只见黄沙滚滚，周围几十公里内几乎没有人家，只有一座庙宇。这庙里没有僧侣，也没有神像，好像菩萨也受不了这沙漠上的困苦而搬家了。六个人在庙里住下了，开始了沙漠观测站的工作。他们研究沙漠上的雨有多少，风有多快，移沙量有多大，植物能不能生长，何处是沙漠的边界。尽管沙漠上的生活很苦，观测站的工作对他们说来也是生疏的，但他们克服了困难，坚持下来。这六个人，以及后来派到观测站去支援他们的人，都是些平凡的人，他们没有以新的纪录，最新的创造闻名国内，但他们的劳动，都和其他新纪录的创造者、和技术革新者一样，是国家建设日益前进的保证。
    工人们在国家的建设中能够有日新月异的成就，是和劳动竞赛中强调学习和掌握新技术，努力改进和提高技术，特别是和强调认真学习和推广苏联的先进经验分不开的。我国过去的工业是落后的，工人的技术水平比较低，有计划的经济建设开始后，新工人增加了，工人的平均技术等级降低了，而我们建设的工厂，特别是苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六个项目，都采用了最先进的技术装备，只有认真学习，才能掌握这些新的技术。
    有谁能说出一张普通的报纸有多少厚？报纸，在肉眼看来，在人们的概念中，是最薄的东西，计算它的厚度好像是不可能的。可是，哈尔滨量具刃具厂生产的最精密的量具，误差只能等于一张报纸厚度的千分之一。说来这真像神话一样。但我们要掌握的就是这样精密的技术。这不是一件容易的事。
    远在第一个五年计划开始的时候，毛泽东同志就号召在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮。他说：“我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。”根据这个指示，工人们在劳动竞赛中，特别注意学习苏联，推广苏联的先进经验。截至一九五四年止，据不完全的统计，各个产业的工人共推广了六百多种苏联的和本国的先进经验。一九五四年有九十五万余人参加了各种技术学校、技术研究会和技术训练班的学习。许多工厂都派了实习生到苏联去，在苏联工人的身旁学习。
    今天，工人的技术水平尽管还落后于国家的需要，但比起过去来，毕竟有显著的提高。一九五四年，全国职工在生产中提出了八十四万多件合理化建议，其中四十六万多件已被采纳。中国机械工业已能制造近二千种比较重要的产品。不久以前，我国第一台六千瓩汽轮机已在上海完成了总装配工作。旅大度量衡仪器厂制成了一台最精密的电动天平。它的体重十九公斤，是由八百五十四个部件组成的，最小的部件体积和小米粒相等，重量仅一公毫。这台天平可以秤出四分之一个火柴头大小的物体的重量。
    工人们不仅为质量良好地完成国家的建设计划和生产计划而奋斗，并且为厉行节约、增加国家的社会主义资金积累，和各种浪费行为进行无情的斗争。一九五四年，重工业部生产成本比国家计划约降低了百分之三左右，基本建设降低成本也超额完成了国家计划，降低成本率达到包工总值的百分之九。在厂矿企业中涌现了许多善于节约地进行生产的模范。石景山钢铁厂的老工人郭绍田就是其中的一个。他花了许多时间埋头在所谓废铁堆里，把大量有用的器材捡回去。一九五三年郭绍田等人修复某号高炉时，所有的管道，所有的备件，没有用一点新料，都是他们从废料堆中找出来的。一九五四年，厂里某号高炉中修时，忽然发现大杠杆下面的平台槽铁烧弯了。由于没有打算修理它，一时没有材料，眼看中修的时间要延长，高炉的月计划要落空。这时，郭绍田把从废料里捡出的材料拿来了，马上解决了问题。
    中国工人阶级在国家建设中的这些成就，是和全国人民的支援特别是农民的支援分不开的。广大农民不仅供应了粮食和副食品，不仅供应了轻工业原料，他们在许多地方也直接参加工业或交通建设。在宝成铁路一九五四年的工程中，仅陕西省就有二万多民工直接参加筑路，全省供应了二万五千多立方公尺工程木料，沿线农民扩大了数千亩蔬菜的种植面积，满足筑路职工的需要。在阴雨连绵和大雪纷飞的日子里，沿线农民还是坚持上山砍柴，按时为职工及他们的家属供应燃料。这种情同手足的支援，在每一个工地上、每一个工厂里都是屡见不鲜的。它鼓舞着工人们以更大的努力来完成国家的计划。
    在一九五五年的“五一”国际劳动节，中国工人可以无愧地回忆过去，并将继续不懈地为实现社会主义工业化的伟大理想而奋斗。
