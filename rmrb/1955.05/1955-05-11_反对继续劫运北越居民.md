　　Oppose Continuing the Abduction of North Vietnamese Residents
　　Lǐ Gāo
    The United States and its followers are stepping up their plotting of new conspiracies in Vietnam, attempting to tamper with the Geneva Accords and "extend" the period for civilian migration. The British Foreign Office has even issued a statement suggesting "extending" this period. To achieve this goal, American propaganda organs are doing their utmost to distort the truth and repeat the slander that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is "obstructing" residents from migrating south. However, the truth cannot be distorted, and their slanders have long been shattered by the facts.
    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently strictly adhered to and implemented the Geneva Accords. It regards the entire country as an indivisible whole that must be reunified peacefully. Therefore, it has never obstructed, nor is there any need to obstruct, the freedom of movement of the people. For those residents who genuinely wish to migrate south, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has provided all possible conveniences and assistance. Recently, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam chartered a Polish ship to properly transport a group of people who genuinely wished to relocate to South Vietnam. At the same time, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is also striving to restore normal relations between the northern and southern regions, so that residents on both sides of the temporary military demarcation line can travel freely.
    In contrast, the United States and its followers are hostile to Vietnam's unity, independence, and the people's democratic and free rights, and are doing everything possible to permanently divide Vietnam and obstruct the free movement of people between the northern and southern regions. It is clearly they who are illegally abducting North Vietnamese residents, forcing hundreds of thousands of residents to become displaced, but instead falsely accuse the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of "obstructing" the free migration of residents. However, the investigations of the International Commission for Vietnam have repeatedly proved that this accusation is completely false. The International Commission's first report on the investigation in the Nam Dinh area stated: "The mobile inspection team did not find any evidence to prove that anyone who wished to migrate south was obstructed, or that their rights were hindered in any way when they exercised their rights under Article 14(d) of the (Vietnam Armistice Agreement). However, it received many petitions accusing the French authorities and church authorities of exerting pressure to force some people to move to the south."
    Countless facts prove that the so-called "refugee" problem in Vietnam is entirely created by the United States and its followers for the most despicable political purposes, using illegal means that violate the Geneva Accords and are inhumane. It is part of a shameful conspiracy by the United States to interfere in Vietnam's internal affairs.
    The American aggressor clique clearly knows that its puppet Ngo Dinh Diem is despised by the people, and that the will of the Vietnamese people to strive for national reunification and democratic freedom is unshakable. Therefore, it openly plots to abduct North Vietnamese residents, especially North Vietnamese Catholics, in an attempt to create political capital for the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. A statement by the U.S. State Department on August 8, 1954, shows that the United States regards the atrocity of abducting residents as a "common goal" with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, and as the "maximum opportunity" to "strengthen that government (i.e., the Ngo Dinh Diem clique)." American news agencies reported on this conspiracy even more bluntly. The Associated Press, in reporting on Ngo Dinh Diem's "mission" after being brought to power by the United States, said: "He (Ngo Dinh Diem) must especially persuade the one and a half million Catholics in the Tonkin Delta that their hope lies in him and not in the Communist leader Ho Chi Minh. This Catholic problem is the most important thing for Ngo Dinh Diem, because he himself is a Catholic and a brother of a Vietnamese bishop. Their votes in the election two years later could be decisive." United Press also said: "The southern population... is at least one million less than the northern population. Removing residents is the only hope for the Saigon government to restore equilibrium and gain a chance in... the national election." This means that from the beginning, the United States wanted to abduct North Vietnamese residents to South Vietnam and place them under the police rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, attempting to use them as voting machines to prop up the reactionary rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.
    However, this atrocity of abducting North Vietnamese residents has increasingly been resisted by the abducted residents and the entire Vietnamese people, and has been condemned by world public opinion. United Press Saigon also admitted that the abducted "refugees" were in a miserable situation, "their only demand is to return to the North." For many abducted residents who asked to return to the North, the "freedom" given to them by the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique was to starve to death, die of disease, or be placed under the surveillance of secret agents, soldiers, and police. "Refugees" in Saigon held demonstrations demanding to return to North Vietnam, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique even opened fire and suppressed them. Despite this, many people broke through various obstacles and suppressions and returned to North Vietnam. On April 24 and 25 alone, more than 7,000 people returned to North Vietnam. Recently, residents in the Haiphong area have launched a struggle against the mad abduction. Agence France-Presse continuously acknowledged in its dispatches on the 2nd, 5th, and 7th: "Among Haiphong civil servants, collective desertions have occurred frequently as the withdrawal approaches, with a rate as high as 80 percent"; the residents who were forcibly concentrated were filled with "dissatisfaction," and "now it is a mess"; on May 6, tens of thousands of residents held demonstrations. Agence France-Presse admitted that due to the resolute resistance of the people in the Haiphong area, "refugee departures from Haiphong have virtually stopped," and an American ship sent to abduct residents "will return almost empty."
    Obviously, because the illegal act of abducting residents has suffered strong resistance from the people and cannot be carried out smoothly, the United States and its followers have further put forward the unreasonable demand to "extend" the period for them to abduct residents, attempting to use this to undermine the Vietnamese general election and the provisions of the Geneva Accords. Dulles had already begun to release this kind of air in his speech on March 8 this year, shamelessly insisting that their atrocity of abducting residents was that residents "fled to the South to find freedom," and then took the opportunity to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, making a futile attempt to say: "It would be difficult to create conditions in the North that would allow people to have a genuine choice of freedom." Nguyen Van Thuy, the representative of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique attending the Asian-African Conference, openly clamored in Bandung on April 20: "Unless the deadline for the free movement of people, which is scheduled to end next month, is extended, I do not see how free elections can be held in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords."
    All these facts show how unreasonable the nonsense of the United States and its followers shouting that "the refugee migration will not be completed on May 18" is. They are using this deliberately created excuse to demand tampering with the Geneva Accords and extending the period of resident migration, entirely to enable them to continue to carry out this lawless act of abduction, undermine the Vietnamese election, and obstruct the full implementation of the Geneva Accords, in order to maintain a tense situation in Vietnam. This is not permissible for anyone who cares about peace in Indochina. The French side should assume the responsibility of complying with the provisions of item 8 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and immediately stop continuing to forcibly abduct North Vietnamese residents. As one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, Britain's endorsement of the unreasonable demands of the United States will only encourage the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to more wantonly carry out their activities to undermine the Geneva Accords. This runs counter to the efforts to ensure the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords and consolidate peace in Indochina.

　　反对继续劫运北越居民
　　李高
    美国及其追随者正在越南加紧策划新的阴谋，企图篡改日内瓦协定，“延长”平民迁居的期限。英国外交部甚至发表声明，建议“延长”这种期限。它们为了达到这个目的，美国宣传机关竭力歪曲事实真相，重复污蔑越南民主共和国“阻挠”居民南迁的谰言。但是，真相是歪曲不了的，他们的这些谰言早已被事实打得粉碎了。
    越南民主共和国一贯地严格遵守和履行日内瓦协定，它把全国看作是必须重归和平统一的不可分割的整体，因此，它从来没有、也毫无必要阻挠人民的迁移自由。对于有些真正愿意南迁的居民，越南民主共和国提供了一切便利协助他们。最近，越南民主共和国就租用了一艘波兰船，把一批真正愿意迁居的人妥善送往南越。同时，越南民主共和国政府还力求恢复南北地区之间的正常关系，使临时军事分界线两边地区的居民能够自由来往。
    与此相反，美国及其追随者敌视越南的统一独立和人民的民主自由权利，千方百计地企图长期分裂越南，阻挠南北地区人民之间的自由来往。明明是他们非法劫运北越居民，迫使数十万居民流离失所，却反而诬控越南民主共和国“阻挠”居民的自由迁移。但是，越南国际委员会的调查一再证明了这种指控是完全虚妄的。国际委员会第一次报告书关于在南定地区的调查结果就说：“机动视察小组没有发现任何证据，足以证明有任何人愿意南迁而受到阻挠，或者在他们依照（越南停战协定）第十四条丁款行使他们的权利时受到任何妨碍，但是，却收到了许多请愿书，指控法方当局和教会当局曾经施用压力强迫某些人迁往南部。”
    无数的事实证明，越南的所谓“难民”问题，完全是美国及其追随者为了最卑鄙的政治目的、使用违反日内瓦协议和违反人道的非法手段制造出来的，是美国干涉越南内政的可耻阴谋的一部分。
    美国侵略集团清楚地知道它一手扶植的代理人吴庭艳是受到人民的唾弃的，越南人民争取祖国统一和民主自由的意志是不可动摇的，因此，它就公开地策划劫运北越居民、特别是北越天主教徒，企图替吴庭艳集团制造政治资本。美国国务院一九五四年八月八日的声明显示，美国把劫运居民的暴行看作是它同吴庭艳集团的“共同的目标”，看作是
  “加强那个政府（即吴庭艳集团）的实力”的“最大限度的机会”。美国通讯社对这一阴谋的报道更加露骨。美联社在报道吴庭艳由美国扶上台后的“任务”时说：“他（吴庭艳）特别必须说服东京三角洲的一百五十万天主教徒，使他们相信他们的希望在于他而不在于共产党的领袖胡志明。这个天主教徒问题对吴庭艳来说是最重要的事，因为他自己是一个天主教徒，并且是一个越南主教的兄弟。他们在两年以后的选举中的投票可以起决定性的作用。”合众社也说：“南部人口……至少比北部少一百万。把居民撤走是西贡政府为恢复均势并在……全国选举中获得一个机会的唯一希望。”这就是说美国从起初就要把北越居民劫运到南越去置于吴庭艳集团的警察统治之下，企图把他们作为投票机器来支撑吴庭艳集团的反动统治。
    但是，这种劫运北越居民的暴行，日益受到了被劫运的居民和全越南人民的反抗，并且受到了世界公众舆论的谴责。合众社西贡电也曾承认，被劫运的“难民”处境悲惨，“他们的唯一要求就是回到北方去”。对于许多要求北返的被劫居民，美国和吴庭艳集团给他们的“自由”是饿死、病死或置于特务军警的监视之下。西贡的“难民”为了要求回到北越而举行过示威游行，吴庭艳集团竟开枪屠杀，实行镇压。尽管如此，仍有很多人冲破种种阻挠和镇压，回到北越。在四月二十四、二十五日两天中，就有七千多人回到了北越。最近，海防地区的居民更展开了反对疯狂劫运的斗争。法新社在二日、五日和七日的电讯中连续承认：海防“公务员中间在临近撤退的时候屡有集体逃亡事件发生，其比例高达百分之八十”；被强迫集中的居民中充满了“不满情绪”，“现在是一片混乱”；五月六日并有成万的居民举行游行示威。法新社承认，由于海防地区人民的坚决反抗，海防“难民出境实际上已经停止”，一艘派来劫运居民的美国轮船“将几乎空着回航”。
    显然是由于劫运居民的非法行动，遭受了人民强烈的反抗，不能顺利进行，因此，美国及其追随者进一步提出“延长”他们劫运居民的期限的无理要求，企图借此破坏越南普选，破坏日内瓦协议的规定。杜勒斯在今年三月八日的演说中已经开始放出这种空气，恬不知耻地硬说他们劫运居民的暴行是居民们“逃到南方来找寻自由”，然后就乘机污蔑越南民主共和国，枉费心机地说：“要在北部创造可以让人们有真正选择的自由的条件会是困难的”。吴庭艳集团出席亚非会议的代表阮文瑞四月二十日在万隆更公开叫嚷：“除非预定将于下月截止的人民自由移动的限期予以延长，我看不出如何依照日内瓦协定的规定来举行自由选举。”
    这一切事实说明，美国及其追随者叫喊“难民迁移将不能在五月十八日完竣”的鬼话是多么无理取闹。它们拿这个故意制造的借口来要求篡改日内瓦协定，延长居民迁移期限，完全是想使它们能够继续进行这种无法无天的劫运暴行，破坏越南选举，阻挠日内瓦协定的全部实施，以便在越南保持紧张局势。这是一切关心印度支那和平的人们所不能容许的。法方应该负起遵守日内瓦会议最后宣言第八项的规定的责任，立即停止继续强迫劫运北越居民的行为。作为日内瓦会议的主席之一的英国，附和美国的无理要求，这只会鼓励美国和吴庭艳集团更加放肆地去进行它们的破坏日内瓦协议的活动。这同保证日内瓦协议彻底实施和巩固印度支那和平的努力，是背道而驰的。
