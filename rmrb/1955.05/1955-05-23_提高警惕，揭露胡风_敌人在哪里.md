Raise Vigilance, Expose Hu Feng
　　Where is the Enemy?
　　Ding Ling

　　After reading the materials revealed by Shu Wu in the "People's Daily" on the 13th, Hu Feng's letters to him, I simply couldn't continue my daily work. It was truly terrifying! Where is the enemy? The enemy is right before our eyes, in our own ranks, to our left and right, by our side. It's easy to dodge an open attack, but hard to guard against a hidden arrow! Hu Feng was originally a petty-bourgeois intellectual wearing the cloak of Marxism, pretending to be a revolutionary, mixed in among us, calling us "friends," but in reality harboring such a dark, such a hostile, such a contemptuous feeling towards us, wishing he could trample us to death, a malicious conspirator with organizational ambitions.

　　For twenty years, Hu Feng has always been a difficult figure to unite with or persuade among our literary workers. For twenty years, the Party has been helping him, constantly criticizing him and talking to him. From the responsible comrades of the Party down to ordinary literary workers, no matter how sincere you were, hoping that he would be honest, frank, and open-hearted, no matter whether it was gentle enlightenment or directly pointing out his fundamental problems (the idea that his thinking was opposed to the Party was discussed with him long ago), it had no effect. Our Party patiently and patiently waited for him, year after year. Why are there such difficult "friends" in the world? Where have we seen such stubborn "revolutionary petty-bourgeois" intellectuals? Why is there such a difficult, eternally entangled person? It's even more difficult than talking to someone who doesn't speak the same language! What exactly does he want? What does he hope from us?… Now, we suddenly understand. It turns out that all our words, like serving the people, intellectual reform, unity, stand, Marxism,… these are not what he likes to hear, these are what he opposes, these are what he doesn't want. He only wants one thing, that all power belongs to Hu Feng. He hates the Party, and he naturally wants to hate it, because the Communist Party, communism, opposes individualism and personal ambition. He hates Party-member writers, especially those who hold responsible positions. He hates those who have criticized him, hates all progressive people, and doesn't even spare Wen Yiduo, who sacrificed himself for the democratic movement under the bloody hands of the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, because these people are Party members, supporters and followers of the Party. Now we understand that Hu Feng's "private words" have always been unspeakable, and the "private words" he refuses to talk about are like this!

　　Hu Feng is definitely not just a matter of ideology. Some people think that Hu Feng is still following the revolution, just with ideological problems, just talk about ideology; then now it should be clear: ideology must be put into action! Hu Feng is an extreme individual ambition conspirator. He has "theory," a program, strategies and tactics, and organization. The object of his struggle is the Communist Party. The smokescreen he released can also be clarified: it is not that our Party's literary workers have any sectarianism towards him, but that Hu Feng opposes all Communist Party members and progressive writers from the bottom of his heart. Whoever holds a responsible position, he scolds them; whoever criticizes him, he hates them; whoever has achievements and makes a little contribution to the people, he despises them. Things are also not as Hu Feng has indicated, that he supports the Party, that the Party's leaders are good, but that a few Party's literary work leaders have ruined things. It's not like that at all. He curses any Party leader as a "powerful figure," an "official." They are all muddleheaded and corrupt elements who "only take the average from the words of those around them." He equally opposes our Party's responsible comrades from the depths of his heart. Is this just a matter of ideology?

　　Hu Feng's sarcasm, ill intentions, "smiles concealing insults," and "handshakes" are all things we have experienced, but we never imagined that he was always trying to use a steel wire wrapped in rubber to beat prisoners with those who shook his hand. Such a bloody heart, such cruelty to treat us, only class enemies can do such a thing. We weren't completely oblivious to Hu Feng's baseness, but it's too shameless to establish a base in anti-people newspapers to deal with us! He can do anything bad as long as he achieves the goals of a personal ambition conspirator!

　　Where is our enemy? On the Kashmir Princess plane, secret agents planted a time bomb there. At the exhibition of evidence of US airdropped secret agents, we saw a gun hidden behind a glove. Now, it has also been found in our literary ranks. We often neglect the enemies lurking around us because of our victory and the progress of our motherland. The enemy is insidious, vicious, and all-pervasive. We must be extra vigilant, drag these people in front of the masses, and leave them with nowhere to escape and no place to hide!

　　Hu Feng's anti-Party group has been operating for many years. He used all kinds of deception, enticement, boasting, cultivation, and formed such a small group, with his loyal believers, followers, and sympathizers; they have activity bases, publications, and publishing houses; they have intelligence networks and "undercover agents" in various places. Hu Feng used these to carry out anti-Party activities of spreading rumors, slander, and sowing discord. Now is the time for people in this small group to step forward and stand up. Is it to follow Hu Feng to oppose the Party to the end, or to stand on the side of the people, correct mistakes, and start anew? The editor's note in the "People's Daily" on the 13th points out a clear path: "Stripping off the mask, exposing the truth, and helping the Party thoroughly understand the entire situation of Hu Feng and his anti-Party group, and from then on becoming a real person, is the only way out for Hu Feng and everyone in the Hu Feng faction." There is no way to go except this way!

### 提高警惕，揭露胡风　敌人在哪里

    提高警惕，揭露胡风
　　敌人在哪里
　　丁玲 
    读了十三日的“人民日报”上的舒芜所揭露的材料，胡风给他的一部分信件，我是怎样也无法继续我的日常工作了，真是令人毛骨悚然！敌人在哪里？敌人就在自己的眼面前，就在自己的队伍中，就在左右，就在身边，明枪容易躲，暗箭最难防！胡风原来是一个披着马克思主义外衣，装着革命的小资产阶级知识分子，混在我们里面，口称“朋友”，实际包藏着那末阴暗的、那末仇视我们的、卑视我们的、恨不能把我们一脚踩死的恶毒的心情，进行着组织活动的阴谋野心家。
    二十年来，胡风始终成为我们文艺工作者中的一个不容易团结，也不容易说服的人物。二十年来，党是帮助他的，党不断向他进行过批评，谈话。上自党的负责同志，下至普通的文艺工作者，不管你是多么诚恳，希望他老老实实，坦坦白白，推心置腹的谈谈，不管是娓婉的启发，或直率的指出他的基本问题（他的思想同党是对立的这样的话老早就同他谈过）都没有效果。我们党耐心又耐心的期待着他，一年又一年，为什么世界上有这样难交的“朋友”？我们在什么地方看见过这样顽固的
  “革命的小资产阶级的”知识分子？为什么有这样难谈、永远纠缠不清的人？简直比不通语言的人还困难？到底他要的是什么？他希望我们些什么？……现在，我们恍然大悟了。原来我们所有的话，什么为人民服务啦，什么知识分子改造啦，什么团结啦，立场啦，马克思主义啦，……这些都不是他喜欢听的，都是他反对的，都是他不要的，他只要一点，就是一切权力属于胡风。他仇恨着党，他自然要仇恨的，因为共产党，共产主义反对个人主义，反对个人野心。他恨党员作家，特别是担任负责工作的，他恨批评过他的人，恨一切进步人士，连为民主运动而牺牲在美蒋特务血手下的闻一多也不放过，因为这些人是党员，是党的拥护者和追随者。现在我们弄清楚了，胡风的“私房话”始终见不得人，不肯拿出来谈的“私房话”就是这样的！
    胡风决不只是思想问题。有人认为胡风还是跟着革命走的，只是思想有问题，只要谈思想；那末现在应该明白了：思想是要见诸行动的！胡风是一个极端的个人野心阴谋家，他是有“理论”，有纲领，有战略策略，有组织的。他的斗争的对象是什么，是共产党。他所施放的烟幕也可以搞清楚了：不是我们党的文艺工作者对他有什么宗派主义，而是胡风从骨子里反对所有的共产党员和进步作家。谁担任负责工作了，他骂谁，谁批评他了，他恨谁，谁有了成绩，对人民有点贡献了，他看不起谁。事情也不像胡风所表示的，他是拥护党的，党的负责人是好的，就是几个党的文艺工作领导人搞坏了。完全不是这样，他对任何一个党的负责者都咒骂为“权贵”，“官方”。都是：“只就左右人士底说话中取平均数”的昏庸腐朽分子，他同样从心的深处反对我们党的负责同志的。这难道只是思想问题吗？
    胡风的讽刺，不怀好意，“用微笑包着侮蔑”的
  “握手言欢”，我们都是领教过的，可是我们怎么也没有想到他时刻都捉摸要用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子来打同他握手的人。这样血淋淋的心，这样凶狠毒辣地对待我们，只有阶级敌人才做得出来。胡风的卑劣，我们也不是完全无视的，可是在反人民的报纸上建立据点来对付我们，真太无耻了！他只要达到个人野心家的目的，什么坏事都可以干得出来的！
    我们的敌人在哪里？在克什米尔公主号飞机上，特务在那儿放了定时炸弹。在美国空投特务罪证展览会上，我们看到过藏在手套背面的手枪。现在，在我们的文艺队伍中也发现了。我们常常因为我们的胜利，我们祖国的前进而忽略了埋伏在我们左右的敌人。敌人是阴险毒辣无孔不入的，我们要倍加警惕，把这些人拉到群众面前来，让他们无处可逃，无地容身！
    胡风的反党集团是有过多年经营的。他用了各式各样的欺骗，拉拢，吹嘘，培植，结成这样一个小集团，里面有他的忠实信徒，有追随者和同情者；他们有活动的地盘，刊物和出版社；他们在各地有情报网和“坐探”。胡风就利用这些来进行造谣诬蔑，挑拨离间的反党活动的。现在是这个小集团里面的人脱身站出来的时候了。是追随胡风反党到底呢？还是站在人民的立场上来，改正错误，从新做人呢？十三日“人民日报”的编者按语指出一条明路：“剥去假面，揭露真相，帮助党彻底弄清胡风及其反党集团的全部情况，从此做个真正的人，是胡风及胡风派每一个人的唯一出路。”除了这条路是无路可走的呀！
