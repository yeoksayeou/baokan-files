In the "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives," the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party clearly pointed out: "Cooperatives must economize on expenditures, reduce miscellaneous expenses, eliminate corruption and waste, and avoid blind investment, so as not to increase costs excessively." Some agricultural production cooperatives have not conscientiously implemented this spirit, using limited funds in areas that are not urgently needed for current production. As a result, members are dissatisfied, operations are difficult, and the consolidation of the cooperative is directly affected.

According to reports from various regions, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste in many agricultural production cooperatives is serious. In the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Qingpu County, members invested more than 2,700 yuan. Due to reckless spending, more than 2,600 yuan was quickly used up, and now there is no money for topdressing fertilizer. In the small Yin Village cooperative in the suburbs of Tianjin, the accountant bought a desk and stapler in order to show off. The Xinglong Village cooperative in Acheng, Heilongjiang, even planned to build a collective canteen to ensure neatness during busy farming seasons.

This kind of extravagance and waste has caused anxiety and dissatisfaction among the members, and created a very bad impression on farmers outside the cooperative. Some farmers outside the cooperative sarcastically said: This is the superiority of socialism! Some members said: Even if production increases, it probably won't be enough to pay the interest! They are very "heartbroken" by this extravagance and waste, doubting whether agricultural cooperatives can increase production and income, and are unwilling to actively produce.

The main reason for this phenomenon is that the leaders of the cooperative lack the idea of ​​careful calculation and frugal management, and lack the experience of leading collective production and managing "everyone's property." In addition, the new cooperative's financial management system has not yet been well established, which further facilitates the development of this phenomenon. They do not understand that the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives is concentrated in increasing production and income, and definitely not in setting up stalls and making a show; they do not know how to rationally arrange production and use funds, often prematurely and hastily engaging in things that are currently beyond their capabilities, and using limited funds in non-essential areas.

This kind of extravagance and waste is a fatal wound to agricultural cooperatives, especially new cooperatives with unstable foundations. Some old cooperatives have also encountered great difficulties as a result, and are struggling to survive due to debt. The First Cooperative of Pingle Township in Luoyang is a relatively good old cooperative, but it is now burdened with a large amount of debt, owing more than 5,000 yuan in bank loans, credit cooperative loans, agricultural tool loans from supply and marketing cooperatives, school manure fees, and dividends to members; some members have difficulty in life, and their livestock lack fodder, and there is no money for expenses. In Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, one agricultural production cooperative calculated that each work day could be divided into more than two yuan based on income estimates, but due to excessive expenses, each work day could only be divided into three cents, and the members were generally dissatisfied.

Leaders of agricultural production cooperatives should establish the idea of ​​frugal management and establish a strict financial management system. Spend less money, accomplish more things, carefully calculate, save expenses, and use the limited funds in the most effective areas. Increasing production is important for agricultural production cooperatives, and saving is equally important; if production increases but there is no saving, the income of the members cannot increase, and the cooperative will still be difficult to consolidate.

### 把农业合作社的资金用在最急要的地方

    把农业合作社的资金用在最急要的地方
　　仲秋
    中共中央在“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”中明确指出：“合作社必须节约开支，减少杂费，杜绝贪污和浪费，不要盲目投资，以免成本过大。”有些农业生产合作社没有认真贯彻这一精神，把有限的资金用在并非当前生产迫切需要的地方，结果社员不满意，经营很困难，直接影响了社的巩固。
    据各地的材料反映，许多农业生产合作社铺张浪费的现象是严重的。青浦县红星农业合作社社员投资二千七百多元，由于胡乱开支，很快用去二千六百多元，现在要施追肥，却没有资金了。天津郊区小殷庄社会计员为了摆排场，买了写字台、订书机等。黑龙江阿城兴隆村社为了农忙时干活整齐，还准备修建集体食堂。
    这种铺张浪费的现象，引起社员的焦虑和不满，给社外农民造成很坏的印象。有些社外农民讽刺说：这就是社会主义的优越性！有些社员说：就是增产了，恐怕也不够给利钱！他们对这种铺张浪费的现象很“心疼”，怀疑农业合作社能否增加生产增加收入，也就不愿积极生产了。
    造成这种现象的主要原因是社的领导者缺乏精打细算、勤俭办社的思想，缺乏领导集体生产、安排“大家当”的经验，加以新建社财务管理制度还未很好建立，就更便于这种现象的发展。他们不理解农业合作社的优越性集中表现在增加生产增加收入，绝对不在摆摊子，闹排场；他们不会合理地安排生产，使用资金，常常过早过急地举办目前力所不及的事情，把有限资金用在非必需的地方。
    这种铺张浪费的现象，对于农业社、特别是基础不稳的新社是一种致命伤。有些老社也因此遇到极大的困难，被债务拖得难于维持。洛阳平乐乡第一合作社是较好的老社，现在背着一大笔债，欠银行贷款、信用社贷款、供销社农具贷款、学校粪款、社员分益款共五千多元；有些社员生活困难，牲口缺少草料，都无钱开支。黑龙江呼兰县有一个农业生产合作社，按照收入预算，一个劳动日本来可以分二元以上，由于开支过大，结果一个劳动日只能分三角钱，社员普遍不满意。
    农业生产合作社的领导者应该树立勤俭办社的思想，建立严密的财务管理制度。少花钱，多办事，精打细算，节约开支，把仅有的资金用在最着力的地方。农业生产合作社增产是重要的，节约也同样的重要；如果增产而不节约，社员的收入不能增加，社同样很难巩固。
