    A Wrong Method of Calculating Remuneration
    Yang Ye
    In the suburbs of Xining City, Qinghai Province, there is an agricultural production cooperative called Sujiahe. From November 1954 to February this year, this agricultural cooperative used a total of 3,275 "male and female labor days" and 2,867 "livestock labor days." It is already strange enough to differentiate labor days by male and female; to also record "labor days" for livestock is even more bizarre. If this were merely a method adopted by the peasant masses themselves, it could be attributed to limitations in their cultural and ideological levels. However, this cooperative has resident cadres providing leadership. What is even more noteworthy is that this information is written in the inspection report made by the inspection team dispatched by the Rural Work Department of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and published in the "Qinghai Daily." Neither the Rural Work Department of the Qinghai Provincial Committee nor the "Qinghai Daily" criticized this practice in any way; the inspection team's report even stated: "Of course, it is understandable that poor peasants generally lack livestock, and the index of livestock labor days is somewhat limited and lower than that of middle peasants." They clearly regarded recording "labor days" for livestock as a natural and reasonable method.
    This situation is not unique to Qinghai. Some agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province also calculate remuneration for privately owned livestock based on "work points."
    Logically, only labor should be recorded as "labor days." A "labor day" (or "work point") is a unit used by agricultural production cooperatives to calculate labor remuneration for their members. The higher the yield of the agricultural production cooperative, the higher the actual income per "labor day." Increased yield is the result of the active labor of the members. To record "labor days" for privately owned livestock means that if the agricultural production cooperative increases its production, the owner of the livestock will also receive an additional share of income simply because he owns the livestock. In semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives, it is permissible to give privately owned means of production a certain amount of remuneration; however, to also record "labor days" for the means of production, and to increase the remuneration for the means of production as the yield increases, is unreasonable and contrary to common sense.

    一种错误的计算报酬的方法
　　杨叶
    青海省西宁市郊区，有一个苏家河农业生产合作社。从一九五四年十一月到今年二月，这个农业社共用“男女劳动日”三千二百七十五个，
  “畜力劳动日”二千八百六十七个。劳动日有男女之别，已经是很奇怪的事情了；给畜力也记上了“劳动日”，这就更离奇了。如果这只不过是农民群众自己采取的办法，那还可以说是因为受了文化水平思想水平的限制。可是，这个社是有住社干部在领导的。更值得引起注意的是：这材料是在中共青海省委农村工作部派出的检查组所作的检查报告中写着、在“青海日报”上登载着的。青海省委农村工作部和“青海日报”对这种做法都没有进行任何批判；检查组的这篇报告中还说：“当然，贫农一般缺乏牲口，畜力劳动日的指数因受到一定限制而低于中农是可以理解的。”他们显然把给牲口记“劳动日”当做了当然的、合理的办法。
    这种情形不只发生在青海。河北省也有一些农业生产合作社给私有的牲口按“工分”计算报酬。
    按理讲，只有劳动才能记“劳动日”。“劳动日”（或者“工分”）是农业生产合作社给社员计算劳动报酬的一种单位。农业生产合作社的收获量越高，每个“劳动日”的实际收入也就越高。收获量增加，是社员积极劳动的结果。给私有的牲口记“劳动日”，这就是说，农业生产合作社增产了，牲口的主人也要因为他有牲口而多得一份收入。在半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社里，给私有的生产资料一定的报酬，是可以的；可是，给生产资料也记上了“劳动日”，生产资料的报酬随着收获量的提高而增加，那是不合理的，也是违反常识的。
