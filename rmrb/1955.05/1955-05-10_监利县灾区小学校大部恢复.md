　　Most Elementary Schools in Jianli County Disaster Area Recovered

　　Of the 495 elementary schools in Jianli County, Hubei Province, which were destroyed by floods in 1954, more than 86 percent have been restored to date. More than 34,000 elementary school students are attending classes, accounting for more than 92 percent of the pre-disaster student population. After the 1954 flood receded in Jianli County, the leading organs in various districts paid attention to restoring schools in the disaster area as soon as possible while carrying out production and disaster relief. At that time, many school buildings were destroyed by the floods. On the one hand, they encouraged teachers and mobilized the masses to rebuild school buildings and persist in teaching in the disaster areas. On the other hand, they also provided material assistance for rebuilding school buildings. Since the autumn of 1954, the work of rebuilding school buildings and restoring teaching has been carried out throughout the county. Many teachers personally participated in the hard work of building schools. Parents also enthusiastically donated materials needed for school construction and did voluntary work.

　　监利县灾区小学校大部恢复
    湖北监利县一九五四年遭洪水破坏的四百九十五所小学校，到目前止，已有百分之八十六以上的恢复起来了。到校上课的小学生共有三万四千多名，占受灾前的学生人数百分之九十二多。监利县一九五四年水退以后，各区领导机关在进行生产救灾的同时，就注意到尽快恢复灾区学校的工作。当时许多校舍都被洪水冲毁了，他们一方面鼓励教员和发动群众重建校舍坚持灾区的教学工作，一方面对重建校舍也给予物质上的帮助。从一九五四年秋天起，全县各地都展开重建校舍、恢复教学的工作。许多教员亲自参加了建校的艰苦劳动。家长们也踊跃捐献建校所需材料和做义务工。（石万亭　林美俊）
