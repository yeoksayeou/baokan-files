　　Rural Party's Grassroots Organizations Should Hold Regular General Meetings of Members
　　Ding Li
    The general meeting of members is the highest leading body of the Party's grassroots organizations. It can enhance the enthusiasm of Party members, it can concentrate the experience and wisdom of Party members to enrich the leadership of the branch committee, and it is one of the most basic methods for educating Party members. The experiences and lessons of the CCP Nongfeng Village Branch in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang, in holding general meetings of members fully illustrate this point.
    Before 1953, this branch had not held general meetings of members for a long time. Occasionally, when a general meeting of members was held, it was only to arrange work, and rarely were major issues in the branch's work submitted to the general meeting of members for discussion and resolution. Therefore, the enthusiasm and creativity of the Party members in this branch have never been fully developed, and the Party organization has not been able to use collective strength to ensure the completion of current tasks. In 1954, with the specific assistance of the county and district committees, the branch began to hold regular general meetings of members to discuss and decide on all major issues in the branch's work. For example, in the early summer of 1954, a general meeting of members was held to discuss the summer hoeing work plan. At the meeting, all Party members enthusiastically discussed the plan and put forward many good suggestions. For example, the branch committee originally planned to mobilize 130 women to the fields to thin seedlings; however, Party member Wu Guifang (director of the Women's Federation), based on the rapid growth of seedlings after rain and the impact of late weeding on yield increase, proposed that 180 women should be mobilized to the fields. Everyone also put forward many supplementary and modified opinions on ensuring the quality of summer hoeing field operations. Finally, the general meeting made a resolution based on these opinions. In this way, the enthusiasm of all Party members was greatly enhanced, and everyone turned the implementation of the Party organization's resolutions into a conscious action. Party members all said: The resolution was made by everyone, and everyone must implement it. At the same time, it greatly enriched the leadership experience of the branch committee, making them deeply realize that the general meeting of members is an important method for implementing collective leadership and mobilizing Party members to supervise leadership. After the meeting, branch secretary Wang Yongjiang, deputy branch secretary Fang Yongchun, and branch committee member Wang Yongchun all said: "Originally, we felt that we had considered the work almost completely, but we never thought that everyone would put forward so many opinions. It is indeed impossible to do work based solely on the opinions of a few branch committee members." From then on, the more important work in the village was discussed and resolved by the general meeting of members before being implemented by the Party members.
    However, at present, in a considerable number of rural branches, the phenomenon of not holding or rarely holding general meetings of members has long existed, so that Party members cannot, in accordance with the Party Constitution, participate in discussions on the implementation of Party policies at the general meetings of members; cannot regularly elect branch committees, make suggestions to any Party organs up to the Central Committee, listen to the work reports of the branch committees, and criticize any Party workers at the meetings. Therefore, in these Party organizations, many major issues are often decided by a few people or decided by other meetings instead.
    Many branches often use the excuse that holding general meetings of members will hinder the completion of current work tasks. Facts have proved that holding general meetings of members not only does not hinder the completion of current tasks, but can also ensure that they are completed better. In the grain procurement work in 1954, although some Party members in Quanming Village, Huachuan County, had ideas that were not conducive to the completion of the grain procurement task at that time, the branch of this village understood the role of the general meeting of members, so it immediately convened a general meeting of members to discuss the issue of grain procurement work. Sure enough, the thinking of the Party members was unified at the general meeting of members, ensuring the over-fulfillment of the grain procurement task.
    One of the important reasons for not holding general meetings of members for a long time is that the responsible cadres of many branches do not recognize the role of the general meeting of members, and only want to save trouble and be quick. For example, the responsible cadres of the Shuitou Village branch in Wangkui County said: "If there is something, a few main cadres can discuss it together." In this way, not only are many major issues in the branch's work decided by a few people, but also the democratic rights of Party members are deprived.
    Another reason for not being able to hold general meetings of members regularly is that some branches use the branch committee to replace the general meeting of members. They say: "Since the issue has already been discussed and decided by the branch committee, what is the point of raising it to the general meeting of members for discussion, why bother doing it twice?" As a result, many major issues within the Party are only decided by the branch committee. Sometimes, although a general meeting of members is held, it is only to implement the decisions of the branch committee. The branch committee and the general meeting of members are two different organs of the Party organization, each with its own different responsibilities. The branch committee is the executive organ, and it is elected by the general meeting of members. The general meeting of members is the highest leading body of the grassroots organization, and it is the organ that embodies the will of all Party members. The branch committee must never replace the general meeting of members.
    Still other Party organizations, because they often take the big and small issues in the branch's work to the group meeting for discussion and decision, are unwilling to hold general meetings of members again. This is also wrong. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his book "On the Party": "The method of incorporating Party members into several groups within the Party branch should be adopted, which is convenient and useful for work, but the role of the group should not be overemphasized, and many tasks should not be decentralized to the group for implementation." The activities of the Party's grassroots organizations should be based on the general meeting of branch members as the main form of activity; because the Party group is not a Party organization at the level. Of course, it is permissible for some branches to conduct activities in Party groups because the Party members reside relatively dispersedly. However, the content of group activities must be uniformly arranged by the branch. All major issues in the branch must be decided under the discussion of all Party members of the branch.
      The county and district committees in various places should lead the grassroots organizations to hold general meetings of members regularly. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent formalism tendencies in holding general meetings of members. Now, some Party organizations do not notify all Party members of the agenda of the meeting before holding a general meeting of members to allow everyone to prepare opinions; at the meeting, they do not fully promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from the bottom up, and only pass the "resolutions" proposed by the branch committee; after the meeting, they do not check the implementation of the resolutions of the meeting. This kind of formalistic approach also cannot give play to the role of the general meeting of members.

　　农村党的基层组织应该定期召开党员大会
　　丁力
    党员大会是党的基层组织的最高领导机关。它可以提高党员的积极性，它可以把党员的经验和智慧集中起来，充实支部委员会的领导，它是教育党员的最基本的方法之一。黑龙江双城县中共农丰村支部召开党员大会的经验教训，充分地说明了这一点。
    这个支部，在一九五三年以前，长期不召开党员大会。偶尔召开一次党员大会，也只是为了布置工作，很少把支部工作中的重大问题，提交到党员大会上讨论和作出决议。因此，这个支部中的党员的积极性和创造性始终没有能够充分发挥出来，党组织也就不能运用集体的力量来保证当前各项工作任务的完成。一九五四年在县委、区委的具体帮助下，支部开始定期召开党员大会，讨论和决定支部工作中的一切重大问题。如一九五四年初夏，就召开了一次党员大会，讨论了夏锄工作计划。会上，全体党员热烈地讨论了这一计划，提出了许多很好的意见。例如支部委员会原计划发动一百三十名妇女下地间苗；但是党员吴桂芳（妇联主任）根据雨后小苗长的快、薅晚了伤根影响增产等情况，提出了应当发动一百八十名妇女下地的修改意见。在保证夏锄田间作业质量等方面，大家也提出了不少补充和修改意见。最后根据这些意见，大会作出了决议。这样，大大地提高了全体党员的积极性，大家把执行党组织的决议变成了自觉的行动。党员都表示：决议是咱们大家作的，就得大家来执行。同时，也大大地丰富了支部委员会的领导经验，使他们深深体会到：党员大会是贯彻集体领导和发动党员监督领导的重要方法。支部书记王永江、副支部书记方永春、支部委员王永春等，在大会后都表示：“本来觉得对工作考虑的差不多了，没曾想大家又提出了这么多的意见，的确光凭几个支部委员的意见做工作是不行的。”从这次以后，村内比较重大的工作，都是通过党员大会讨论和作出决议后，才由党员去贯彻执行。
    但是，目前在相当一部分农村支部里，却长期存在着不召开或很少召开党员大会的现象，以致党员不能按照党章规定，在党员大会上参加关于党的政策实施问题的讨论；不能定期选举支部委员会，向党的任何机关直至中央提出建议，听取支部委员会的工作报告，并在会上批评党的任何工作人员。因而在这些党组织内，许多重大问题，常常是由少数人决定或由其他会议代替决定。
    许多支部常常借口召开党员大会会妨碍当前工作任务的完成。事实证明：召开党员大会不但不妨碍当前任务的完成，而且能保证完成得更好。一九五四年购粮工作中，桦川县泉明村当时虽然有些党员的思想不利于购粮任务的完成，但是这个村的支部懂得党员大会的作用，因此立即召开党员大会讨论购粮工作问题。果然在党员大会上统一了党员的思想，保证了超额完成购粮任务。
    长期不召开党员大会的重要原因之一，是许多支部的负责干部没有认识党员大会的作用，而只是图省事、快当。例如望奎县水头村支部的负责干部就说：“有事，几个主要干部在一块商量商量就行了。”这样，不但支部工作中的许多重大问题由少数人来决定，而且还剥夺了党员的民主权利。
    不能定期召开党员大会的再一种原因，是有些支部用支部委员会代替了党员大会。他们说：“既然问题已经由支部委员会讨论决定了，还提到党员大会上讨论个啥，何必费二遍事。”结果党内许多重大问题只由支部委员会决定。有时虽然也召开党员大会，但这只是为了贯彻支部委员会的决定。支部委员会和党员大会是党组织的两个不同机关，都有自己不同的职责。支部委员会是执行机关，它是由党员大会选举出来的。而党员大会是基层组织的最高领导机关，它是体现全体党员意志的机关。支部委员会决不能代替党员大会。
    另有些党组织，因为经常把支部工作中的大小问题都拿到小组会上去讨论、决定，所以，不愿再召开党员大会。这也是不对的。刘少奇同志在“论党”一书上讲：“在党的支部之内，将党员编入若干小组的办法，是应该采用的，对工作有些便利，有些作用，但不应该过分强调小组作用，不应将许多工作分散在小组去进行。”党的基层组织的活动，应以支部党员大会为主要活动形式；因为党的小组不是党的一级组织。固然，有些支部党员居住的比较分散，适当的以党的小组进行活动，是可以的。但小组活动的内容，必须是支部统一布置的。支部中一切重大问题，必须在支部全体党员参加讨论下决定。
      各地县委、区委应当领导基层组织，定期召开党员大会。同时，要防止召开党员大会中的形式主义倾向。现在，就有些党组织在召开党员大会以前，不把大会的议题通知全体党员，让大家准备意见；会上，不充分发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，只是通过支部委员会提出的“决议”；会后，不检查大会决议的贯彻情形。这种形式主义的作法，同样不能发挥党员大会的作用。
