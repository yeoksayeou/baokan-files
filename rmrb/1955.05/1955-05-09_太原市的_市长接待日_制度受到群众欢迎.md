To the Editor:

　　Since Taiyuan City implemented the "Mayor's Reception Day" system, it has been welcomed by the majority of citizens. The following are the situations of the last two times.

　　The Taiyuan Municipal People's Committee passed a trial method for contacting people's representatives at its first meeting on February 18 this year. The method stipulates that the mayor should receive people's representatives on the 15th of each month.

　　March 15th was the first "Mayor's Reception Day." On this day, twenty-five municipal people's representatives met with Mayor Yue Weifan. They reflected more than one hundred situations and problems, and proposed improving the work of the government and state-owned enterprises and improving work style and service attitude, accounting for a quarter of the total number of problems. On April 15th, another twenty-seven municipal people's representatives reflected opinions and problems in various aspects to the mayor, totaling one hundred and thirty items. At present, half of these opinions have been properly handled.

　　In the days before the "Mayor's Reception Day," in order to report the situation and problems in various aspects to the mayor in detail, the representatives had conducted in-depth understanding of some issues and recorded the investigated materials in detail in their notebooks. For example, Wang Gengwen, a people's representative from the North Urban Area, in order to clarify the problem of Zhang Bucheng, a household registration officer of the 28th dormitory of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, living in the house without the owner's consent and retaliating against the owner, personally went to Jiancaoping, more than ten miles away, to conduct investigations from various aspects. Youth student representative Xue Li, in addition to frequently contacting students and listening to their reflections, constantly contacted district representatives and street cadres to collect public opinions; people's representatives participating in street resident work had closer relationships with residents and families of revolutionary martyrs in order to reflect the problems that the masses urgently need to solve. People's representatives in rural suburbs came from fifty or sixty miles away to reflect the problems that farmers urgently need to solve to the mayor.

　　The Municipal People's Committee fully takes responsibility for handling the opinions and demands reflected on the Mayor's Reception Day; the General Office assigned special personnel to sort out all the problems according to their nature; and regularly convene secretarial meetings of various departments. At the meeting, the mayor made specific instructions on certain issues, and also stipulated the time limit for handling. The leaders of each unit generally read or study the opinions reflected by the representatives. In the process of handling many specific problems, people were sent to conduct on-site investigations or contacted the original reflecting representatives. For example, the Public Utilities Administration, in response to the representative's suggestion to move the scattered tap water stations on the street to the back lanes to rectify the city appearance and facilitate transportation, after a general investigation, found that more than a dozen water stations in the urban area needed to be moved, and immediately decided to move the water stations to the back lanes one after another based on the population of water supply and the traffic flow on the road.

　　The handling of these opinions has promoted the work of the government. For example, in the urban planning issue, with the increasing development of the city, the house numbers are chaotic (such as the same number has four types of A, B, C, and D), which has brought inconvenience to all aspects. After carefully considering this opinion, the Municipal Public Security Bureau decided to start planning for rectification. For another example, the Taiyuan City Labor Allocation Office had a chaotic work order, procrastinated in handling affairs, and had a bad attitude towards the masses. The masses who requested jobs from the office reflected: It is more difficult to see a cadre here than to see the governor. After Yang Zhike and Du Jinlin, people's representatives among the employees, reflected this situation to the mayor, the office immediately convened a meeting of all cadres to conduct an inspection and rectification of the work in accordance with the decision of the bureau affairs meeting, and cadres with poor work style were criticized. At present, the work of this office has been greatly improved.

　　After the implementation of the "Mayor's Reception Day" system, it not only solved many difficulties among the masses, but also discovered many important problems. This system has been universally welcomed by the people's representatives of Taiyuan City. The representatives reflected that the "Mayor's Reception Day" system is really a good system. In the future, we will work harder to reflect the opinions and demands of the people to the mayor and do the work that a people's representative should do.

### 太原市的“市长接待日”制度受到群众欢迎

　　太原市的“市长接待日”制度受到群众欢迎编辑同志：
    太原市执行“市长接待日”的制度以来，受到广大市民的欢迎，下面就是最近两次的情况。
    太原市人民委员会在今年二月十八日第一次会议上通过了一项和人民代表联系的试行办法。办法中规定：市长在每月十五日要接待人民代表。
    三月十五日是第一次“市长接待日”，这一天有二十五位市人民代表与岳维藩市长见过面，他们反映了一百多条情况和问题，提议改进政府和国营企业的工作、改善工作作风和服务态度的占问题总数的四分之一。四月十五日又有二十七位市人民代表向市长反映了各方面的意见和问题一百三十条。目前这些意见有半数已得到了妥善的处理。
    在“市长接待日”的前几天，代表们为了详实地向市长反映各方面的情况和问题，他们曾对一些问题进行了深入的了解，并将调查来的材料详尽地记在笔记本上。如北城区市人民代表王庚文，为了搞清太原钢铁厂二十八宿舍户籍员张补成住房子不经房主同意并对房主打击报复的问题时，就曾亲自去十几里外的尖草坪作了多方面的调查。青年学生代表薛丽，除经常和学生联系，听取反映外，并不断和区代表街道干部联系搜集群众意见；参加街道居民工作的人民代表为了反映群众迫切需要解决的问题，他们和居民及烈军属之间的关系更加密切了。郊区农村的人民代表，有的从五、六十里路以外赶来向市长反映农民急待解决的问题。
    市人民委员会对市长接待日反映出来的意见和要求，完全做到负责的处理；办公厅责成专人对所有问题按性质分别整理；并定期召集各部门的秘书会议，会上由市长对某些问题作具体指示，还规定处理限期。各单位对代表反映的意见，一般均经过领导批阅或研究。许多具体问题在处理过程中都派人实地调查或者和原反映代表取得联系。如公用事业管理局对代表建议把散放在大街上的自来水站移到背巷以整市容和便利交通的问题，经过普遍调查，发现市区有十多处水站需要迁移，当即根据供水人口多少和马路上的行人流量，决定将水站先后迁入背巷。
    通过这些意见的处理，对政府工作是起了推动作用。如在市区规划问题上，随着城市的日益发展，门牌号码杂乱（如同一号码有甲、乙、丙、丁四个），给各方面带来了不便。市公安局在认真考虑了这一意见后，决定着手筹划整顿。又如太原市劳力调配处工作秩序混乱，办事拖拉，对群众态度恶劣，向该处要求职业的群众反映：见省长都没有见这里一个干部困难。职工中的人民代表杨之科、杜锦麟向市长反映了这一情况后，该处即依照局务会议的决定，召集了全处干部会对工作进行了检查和整顿，作风不好的干部受到了批评。目前这个处的工作已有很大的改进。
      “市长接待日”的制度执行以后，不仅解决了群众中的不少困难，而且还发现了不少的重要问题。这个制度受到了太原市人民代表的普遍欢迎。代表们反映“市长接待日”的制度真是一项好制度，今后我们要加倍努力，把人民群众中的意见和要求反映给市长，做好一个人民代表应做的工作。
