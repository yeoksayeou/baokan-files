Xinjiang is launching a cashmere collection campaign this year in the Aksu, Hotan, Yili, Tacheng, and Urumqi regions, counties directly under the South Xinjiang Administrative Office, and other key cashmere-producing counties in various regions and autonomous prefectures throughout the Tianshan North and South. The Xinjiang Provincial Livestock Products Company has ordered 50,000 cashmere combs from Tianjin, which have been shipped to various cashmere collection areas. Each comb is accompanied by instructions for use printed in Han, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian languages to facilitate learning and use by farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups. More than 400 cashmere collection technicians from various ethnic groups have also been trained in various locations. Currently, the work of collecting cashmere has begun in some areas of southern Xinjiang where the weather is warmer.

Cashmere is one of Xinjiang's major specialties, with an annual output of approximately 600 tons. However, in the past, due to the lack of cashmere collection habits among farmers and herdsmen, the vast majority of cashmere naturally fell off and was lost in the mountains, or was sheared together with sheep's wool and used to twist wool rope or weave pockets. The amount of cashmere purchased by the state was less than 5% of the potential output. This situation will be greatly changed this year.

　  新疆开展抓山羊绒运动
    新疆省今年将在天山南北的阿克苏、和阗、伊犁、塔城、乌鲁木齐等专区、南疆行署直属县以及其他各专区、自治州的重点产绒县开展抓山羊绒运动。新疆省畜产公司向天津定购了五万把羊绒抓子已分别运往各抓绒地区，每把抓子并附有一份用汉、维、哈、蒙等四种文字印出的使用方法说明，以便利各族农牧民学习使用。各地并训练了四百多名各民族抓绒技术人员。现在，抓山羊绒工作已在天气较暖的南疆一些地区开始。
    山羊绒是新疆省主要特产之一，每年可产山羊绒六百吨左右。但过去由于农牧民没有抓绒习惯，绝大多数山羊绒都自然脱落、散失山野，或者被与羊毛一起剪下，用来拧毛绳或织口袋，国家收购的山羊绒尚不足应产量的百分之五。今年将大大改变这种情况。（本报集体通讯员新疆日报编辑部）
