　　I am Indignant, I am Vigilant
　　Shu Xincheng
    I do not know Hu Feng, and I have rarely read Hu Feng's articles, but for many years, I have had a wrong view of him, that is, I thought he was a "progressive writer"!
    I am not a literary worker, let alone a writer, but from an educational point of view, I attach great importance to literary works and writers: because literary works can inspire people's revolutionary enthusiasm and conduct in-depth and extensive ideological education for people. Holding such a reason, I valued Hu Feng, this "writer," and was deceived by Hu Feng for a long time.
    When I received the "Opinions on Literary Issues by Hu Feng" attached to the Literary Gazette at the end of January, I intended to take a closer look, but his article was difficult to read, and I put it down after reading a little. In early February, I saw "We Cannot Transform Our Literary Movement According to Hu Feng's 'Appearance'" (Wang Yao) published in the "People's Daily" on January 31st in Changsha, and only then did I understand the main points of Hu Feng's suggestions. I felt that his "self-expansion" could go down the road of Hitler, so I talked about Hu Feng with Comrade Zhou Libo. I believed that Hu Feng was not only a typical example of bourgeois idealist egoism, but also, judging from Hu Feng's so-called suggestions this time, he seemed to be a bit mentally ill. In other words, at that time, I only regarded Hu Feng's mistake as an ideological problem within the people, plus a feeling of "mental illness" to excuse him.
    After seeing the "Liberation Daily" reprint of the "People's Daily" editor's note and Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" on the 14th of this month, I realized that exposing Hu Feng was not an ideological issue, but a serious political issue. I was extremely indignant, and when I went to read Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism," I couldn't continue reading it several times. I hated him for using the banner of Marxism to deceive the masses for a long time. I hated him for insulting the glorious title of literary writer. I hated him for opposing the Chinese Communist Party, opposing the people, and opposing the socialist revolution in an organized, planned, and long-term hidden manner! After reading the "People's Daily" editor's note on the 18th, I became even more sober. I think Hu Feng is as hateful as Hu Shi. Hu Shi openly peddles imperialist philosophical poisons and poisons the Chinese people. Hu Feng, on the other hand, disguises himself as a "Marxist" and carries out his anti-Party and anti-people conspiracies, so that everyone is confused under his disguise and suffers harm invisibly. I am indignant, I am vigilant, so when Shanghai held a cadre meeting of academic and cultural workers on May 20th, I raised my hand and applauded in favor of the suggestion made by more than 20 professors from the Chinese Department of East China Normal University to revoke Hu Feng's qualification as a representative of the National People's Congress, expel Hu Feng from the Chinese Writers Association, and remove him from his position as an editorial board member of "People's Literature" in accordance with the law.
    Why was I so naive and so easily and for so long deceived by Hu Feng in the past? I found that it was because I could not use the working class's position and viewpoint to make a serious overall investigation and essential analysis based on specific facts, but only looked at problems from the phenomenon. After this factual education, I not only want to be vigilant against Hu Feng and the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, as well as individuals or groups similar to them, but I also want to wage a constant and continuous struggle against the non-proletarian thoughts in my mind—strive to study dialectical materialism, criticize idealist thoughts, to transform myself and defend the achievements of our socialist revolution!

### 我愤慨，我警惕

　　我愤慨，我警惕
　　舒新城
    我不认识胡风，也很少看胡风的文章，但是，很多年来，我对于他有一种错误的看法，就是认为他是“进步作家”！
    我不是文艺工作者，更不是作家，但从教育的角度上，我很重视文艺作品和作家：因为文艺作品能鼓舞人们的革命热情，对人们进行深入而广泛的思想教育。我持着这样一个理由，所以重视胡风这个“作家”，并且长期地为胡风所欺骗。
    当一月底接到文艺报附发“胡风对文艺问题的意见”的时候，我曾经打算细看一下，无奈他的文章很难读，看了一点就丢下了。二月初在长沙看到一月三十一日“人民日报”上发表的“不能按照胡风的‘面貌’来改造我们的文艺运动”（王瑶），才把胡风的建议的要点弄清楚。我感觉他的“自我扩张”可以走到希特勒的道路上去，所以我和周立波同志谈及胡风，我认为胡风不但是资产阶级唯心论中唯我主义的典型，而且从胡风此次的所谓建议看来，又好像是有点神经病。也就是说，我当时只把胡风的错误当作一个人民内部的思想问题，再加上一个“神经病”的感觉去开脱他。
    本月十四日看到“解放日报”转载“人民日报”编者按语和舒芜“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”以后，我才认识揭露胡风，不是什么思想问题，而是严重的政治问题。我愤慨极了，再去看胡风的“我的自我批判”，几次都看不下去。我愤恨他假借马克思主义的招牌，长期欺骗群众，我愤恨他侮辱了文艺作家的光荣称号，我愤恨他有组织、有计划、而且长期隐蔽地反对中国共产党，反对人民反对社会主义革命事业！看到十八日“人民日报”的编者按语，我更加清醒了。我认为胡风和胡适一样可恶，胡适是公开地贩卖帝国主义哲学毒物，向中国人民进行毒害，胡风则是乔装为“马克思主义”者，进行他的反党、反人民的阴谋活动，使大家在他的伪装之下被迷惑，而无形中蒙受损害。我愤慨，我警惕，所以五月二十日上海举行学术文化工作者干部大会的时候，我举手、鼓掌赞成了华东师范大学中文系二十多位教授提出依法撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表资格和开除胡风中国作家协会会籍、撤销他的“人民文学”编委职务的建议。
    过去为什么这样幼稚，这样容易而长期地受胡风的欺骗？我发现是自己不能用工人阶级的立场和观点，根据具体的事实严肃地作整体的考察、本质的分析，而只从现象上看问题。经过这一次事实教育，我不独要警惕胡风和胡风反党集团以及与之相类似的个人或集团的阴谋，我更要对我头脑中的非无产阶级思想作经常的、不断的斗争——努力学习辩证唯物主义，批判唯心主义思想，以改造个人，保卫我们社会主义革命的成果！
