　　A Batch of Shanghai Automobile Drivers Go to Xinjiang
　　On the morning of the 11th, fifty-eight automobile drivers from Shanghai set off for Xinjiang Province to participate in construction work.
　　Before liberation, many workers in Shanghai with automobile driving skills turned to becoming rickshaw pullers because they could not find employment opportunities for a long time. This year, the Shanghai Municipal Transportation Administration's Rickshaw and Tricycle Management Office, entrusted by the Xinjiang Provincial Transportation Department's Transportation Bureau, organized 307 workers originally with automobile driving skills from among the rickshaw workers in Shanghai, who voluntarily participated in short-term training starting from April 15th. These first 58 workers who completed the training have improved in terms of political understanding and automobile driving and repair skills. After testing, they have basically reached the standard of unified driving.
　　These workers are all excited to be able to directly participate in the construction of the motherland. At the farewell meeting jointly held by the Shanghai Municipal Transportation Administration's Rickshaw and Tricycle Management Office and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Transport Workers' Union, the workers pledged that after arriving in Xinjiang, they would diligently study technology and work hard to repay the care of the Party and the People's Government.

　  上海一批汽车司机去新疆
    十一日清晨，上海市有五十八名汽车驾驶员出发到新疆省参加建设工作。
    解放以前，上海市不少有驾驶汽车技术的工人，因为长期找不到就业机会，转成了三轮车工人。今年，上海市交通运输管理局人力车三轮车管理所接受新疆省交通厅运输局的委托，在上海市三轮车工人中组织原来有驾驶汽车技术的三百零七名工人，从四月十五日起自愿参加了短期训练。第一期结业的这五十八名工人，在政治认识和汽车驾驶、修理技术方面都有了提高，经过测验，基本上都达到了统一驾驶的标准。
    这些工人都为能直接参加祖国建设事业感到兴奋。在上海市交通运输管理局人力车三轮车管理所和中国搬运工会上海市委员会联合举行的欢送会上，工人们提出保证：到新疆以后，一定要认真钻研技术，努力工作，来答谢党和人民政府的关怀。（本报驻上海记者）
