　　Before and After the Announcement
　　By our reporter, Ji Xichen
　　Before this spring, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, increased nearly thirty times compared to before the autumn of 1954. The development speed was so fast, but the preparation was insufficient. In the process of establishing cooperatives, there was a lack of unified and clear regulations on various specific policies. The principle of voluntarism and mutual benefit was not effectively implemented when dealing with many specific issues. In addition, counter-revolutionary remnants lurking in the countryside spread rumors and sabotage, causing some farmers to have concerns and misunderstandings about agricultural cooperation and production development. Since the winter of last year, phenomena such as damaging farm tools, selling livestock, felling trees, and not actively managing winter crops have occurred in various places. In order to eliminate the masses' misunderstanding of cooperation and refute the distortions and rumors of bad elements, the Wenjiang County People's Government issued an announcement in mid-January, addressing the issues that the local people were most concerned about and most urgently demanded to be resolved. The announcement solemnly declared the specific policies of agricultural production cooperatives for handling issues such as draft cattle, farm tools, trees, pig feed, and production investment. As soon as the announcement came out, the countryside rejoiced. Farmers gathered everywhere to read the announcement, saying, "Now we have a bottom line in our hearts!" The enthusiasm of the masses for production soared.

　　In the past, when Yongshang Township established cooperatives, it violated the policy of voluntarism and mutual benefit by prematurely and excessively reducing the remuneration for land and other means of production, unreasonably lowering the prices of members' draft cattle, farm tools, and fertilizers. Some cooperatives even valued a cow lower than a pig. At the same time, the repayment period for cattle was generally set at more than three to five years, which damaged the interests of many cattle owners, especially middle peasants. They said, "We haven't benefited from joining the cooperative, and we get hit with a stick as soon as we enter the door." Many people did not take good care of their draft cattle, and twenty-five cattle died in the whole township. Later, the farmers read the provisions on the cattle issue in the announcement, knowing that the members' draft cattle would be included in the cooperative based on the members' voluntarism and the needs of agricultural production cooperatives and members' production. Those who did not want to join the cooperative would be rented by the agricultural production cooperative at the market price; those who were willing to join must be reasonably priced at the market price, and the agricultural production cooperative must pay off the cattle payment within one to one and a half years, and interest would be calculated if the payment was not cleared by the due date. Many people said, "Yes, this is fair and reasonable!" "If the interests of cattle owners are protected in this way, more people will raise cattle in the future." While posting the announcement, agricultural production cooperatives in various places also corrected the phenomenon of low prices for draft cattle in the past, dispelling the farmers' ideological concerns. Farmers actively repaired cattle pens, gave cattle medicine, and added grass and fodder to protect draft cattle, and collectively went to distant places to buy draft cattle. Zhao Youting, a middle peasant in the sixth village who had feared that cattle would suffer losses if they joined the cooperative and abused his cattle to death in the past, now read the announcement and understood the policy. He said, "Now I can't make the wrong calculation again. I will not only buy cattle, but also bring cattle into the cooperative!" He bought back a large water buffalo in a few days.

　　The announcement helped many cadres correct mistakes in their work. The cadres of Sansheng Township, who became arrogant and complacent due to their achievements in building cooperatives, were unclear about the current semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives. In order to blindly increase the socialist factors in the collective management of the cooperatives, they violated the Party's instructions and disregarded the opposition of the masses when working in Daming Village. In addition to transferring major means of production such as land and draft cattle to public ownership, even the pigs, chickens, ducks, and other poultry and livestock raised by the members were forced to join the cooperative and become public property. They also stipulated that chickens joining the cooperative must weigh three catties, otherwise they would have to pay a fee of one yuan and five jiao. This caused a panic among the members, who slaughtered or sold their livestock. In a few days, the number of pigs and chickens in the village was reduced by more than half. The pigs that joined the cooperative were also poorly fed due to lack of feed, and most of them became thin. Seeing this situation, the farmers said painfully: "We will never raise pigs and chickens again." At this time, the instructions of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the announcement of the County People's Government arrived in the village. With the help of the County Party Committee's working group, the township cadres realized their mistakes and made a self-criticism at the members' meeting. After discussion, the livestock and poultry that the members had joined the cooperative were returned to them. In order to help the members develop household sideline occupations, the Daming Agricultural Production Cooperative also coordinated and solved the problem of lack of feed for the members to raise pigs; adjustments were also made to the members' private plots to ensure a reliable guarantee for the members to feed livestock and poultry. The enthusiasm of the masses for raising pigs has been improved, and they have been buying pigs, repairing pig pens, and cutting pig grass. Out of 163 households in the village, more than 180 pigs are now raised.

　　Many agricultural production cooperatives in Wenjiang County made the wrong regulation that "trees on the edge of the land must be included in the cooperative along with the land" when establishing cooperatives. As a result, the masses began to cut down bamboo forests and trees in large quantities. They said, "Sooner or later, it will become public property. If we don't cut it down now, we won't have firewood to burn in the future." More than 1,000 trees were felled in Yongxing Township in a few days, and even pine and cypress trees, fruit trees, and bamboo forests that had been cultivated for decades were cut down. Xu Yuting, a poor peasant in the seventh village, feared that the trees would become public property if they joined the cooperative, and cut down more than 20 cypress trees left by his ancestors. One day, he was cutting down a tree when someone from the same village ran to tell him: "Don't cut it down anymore. The announcement says that whoever owns the trees owns them. Trees and bamboos, regardless of size or distance, can be excluded from the cooperative." At this time, he said regretfully: "If I had known that the policy was like this, I wouldn't have harmed the trees." He immediately planted more than 300 saplings in the felled forest land and on the riverbank. After in-depth publicity, the phenomenon of cutting down trees and bamboos was not only quickly stopped throughout the township, but a wave of afforestation was also set off, planting more than 37,000 saplings.

　　The Gongping Township Agricultural Production Cooperative set the amount of production investment too high and expanded the basic construction in the cooperative without a plan. As a result, the economic burden on the members was generally increased, so that poor peasants could not afford it and middle peasants were afraid. In some villages, members were forced to sell trees and livestock because they could not pay the production investment. The first village's agricultural production cooperative stipulated that the investment in cash for each mu of land was eight yuan per year. Some farmers said, "The agricultural cooperative is still run by those with money, and those without money still can't get in." Wang Chongming sold his piglets because of the investment. He said, "The agricultural cooperative is good in everything, but the investment barrier cannot be passed." The phenomenon of squeezing out middle peasants occurred in many cooperative investments. Xu Chunting, a middle peasant in the seventh village, was forced to invest several times under the "assessment" of cadres. Many middle peasants became panicked. They said: The agricultural cooperative is a bottomless pit that cannot be filled. They do not actively manage production and do not add fertilizer to winter crops, fearing that increasing investment will reduce income. According to the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions and the County People's Government's announcement, the phenomenon of blindly investing was generally corrected in various villages. In order to appropriately control investment, the twenty-five agricultural production cooperatives in the township have stipulated an appropriate amount of production funds based on the yield of the shares of land as the production base for the whole society for one year. The investment generally does not exceed 25% of the total agricultural income; and it is stipulated that the investment in kind such as seeds and natural fertilizers should be the main investment, and the cash investment only accounts for 20% to 40% of the total investment. For members whose investment in cash exceeds the prescribed amount, the excess part is calculated at the interest rate stipulated by the credit cooperative. After advocating "running the society diligently and frugally," many societies have changed their plans to blindly build cattle sheds, pig pens, and increase the application of commercial fertilizers. In order to ensure a 5% increase in rice production this year, the "Jijian" society has revised its plan, actively exploring potential, improving farming techniques, expanding the accumulation of more than 100,000 catties of fertilizer, and strengthening the field management of winter crops to strive for a bumper harvest of wheat and rapeseed.

　　布告前后
　　本报记者　纪希晨
    今年春前，四川省温江县的农业生产合作社比一九五四年秋前增加将近三十倍。发展速度这样快，准备工作却不足，在建社过程中对各项具体政策缺乏统一明确的规定，处理许多具体问题时未能切实贯彻自愿互利的原则，加上潜藏在农村的反革命残余分子造谣破坏，部分农民对农业合作化和发展生产产生了顾虑和误解。去年入冬以后，各地相继发生破坏农具，杀卖牲畜，砍伐树木，和不积极经营小春作物的现象。温江县人民政府为消除群众对合作化的误解，驳斥坏分子的曲解和造谣，针对当地群众最关心、最迫切要求解决的几个问题，在一月中旬颁发布告，郑重地向广大农民宣布了农业生产合作社处理耕牛、农具，树木，猪的饲料和生产投资等问题的具体政策。布告一出，四乡欢腾。农民们到处团聚着看布告，他们说：“这下心中有底了！”群众生产积极性高涨了起来。
    永胜乡过去建社时，违反自愿两利政策，过早过快地降低土地及其他生产资料的报酬，不合理地压低社员耕牛、农具和肥料的价格，有的社甚至把一头牛价折的还不如一只猪价高；同时又普遍把归还牛款期限规定在三、五年以上，使许多有牛户特别是中农的利益受到了损害。他们说：“入社还没有得到利，刚进门就得挨一棒。”许多人不爱护耕牛了，全乡耕牛死了二十五条。后来，农民们读到布告上关于耕牛问题的规定，知道社员的耕牛入社要根据社员自愿和农业生产合作社及社员生产需要，不愿入社的由农业生产合作社按市价租用；愿入社的必须按市价合理折价，农业生产合作社要在一年至一年半将牛款付清，到期未付清的给计算利息。许多人说：“对呀，这才公道合理啊！”“照这样保护牛主利益，以后喂牛的就多了。”在张贴布告同时，各地农业生产合作社对过去入社耕牛折价偏低的现象也都作了纠正，解除了农民的思想顾虑。农民们积极补修牛圈，给牛灌药，加草料保护耕牛，还集体朋伙到远处购买耕牛。过去怕牛入社吃亏，而把牛虐待死了的第六村中农赵莜亭，如今看了布告，明白了政策，他说：“这下我可再不错打算盘了，我不光买牛，还要带牛入社哩！”没几天就买回一条大水牛。
    布告帮助不少干部改正了工作中的错误。建社中因获得成就而骄傲自满起来的三圣乡干部，由于对当前的半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社认识不清，为盲目增加社里集体经营的社会主义因素，在大名村工作时，违反党的指示，不顾群众的反对，除把土地、耕牛等主要生产资料划归公有外，连社员喂养的猪、鸡、鸭等家禽家畜也都强迫入社归公了。他们还规定入社鸡一定要有三斤重，否则就要缴款一元五角。这样就在社员中间引起了一种恐慌情绪，杀的杀，卖的卖，没几天，村里的猪、鸡减少了一大半。入社的猪也因为缺乏饲料，喂养不好，大部分都瘦了。农民看到这种情况，痛心地说：
  “我们再也不喂猪养鸡了。”正在这个时候，中共四川省委的指示和县人民政府的布告到达了村庄里。乡干部在县委工作组的帮助下，认识了自己的错误，在社员大会上作了检讨，经过讨论，发还了社员入社的家畜家禽。为帮助社员发展家庭副业，大名农业生产合作社还统筹解决了社员养猪缺乏饲料的问题；对社员自留地也作了调整，使社员喂养家畜家禽的饲料有了可靠的保证。群众养猪积极性提高了，纷纷买猪、修圈、割猪草，全村一百六十三户，现在已喂猪一百八十多只。
    温江县许多农业生产合作社在建社时作了“地边树木一律随地入社”的错误规定。于是，群众大量砍伐起竹林树木来了。他们说：“迟早要归公，现在不砍，以后就没柴烧了。”永兴乡几天之内砍树木一千多株，有的连抚育了几十年的松柏树、果木和成片竹林也都砍伐了。七村贫农徐玉亭怕树木入社归公，把祖辈遗留下的柏树砍了二十多株。一天，他正在砍树，同村人跑来告诉他：“快不要砍了，告示上说了，谁的树归谁所有。树木、竹子不论大小、远近都可以不入社了。”这时他懊悔地说：“早知道政策是这样，我也不会蹧害树木了。”他立刻在砍伐了的林地和河边上，新栽起三百多株树苗。经过深入宣传，全乡不仅迅速停止了砍树伐竹的现象，并且掀起了植树造林的热潮，栽了三万七千多株树苗。
    公平乡农业生产合作社过高地规定生产投资金额，无计划地扩大社内的基本建设。结果，普遍加重了社员的经济负担，以致贫农投不起，中农害了怕。有些村庄，社员因为缴纳不起生产投资，被迫卖树卖家畜。一村农业生产合作社规定每亩地一年投资现款八元。有的农民说：“农业社还是有钱的吃得开，没钱的还是进不来。”王崇明因为投资把小猪也卖了，他说：“农业社啥都好，就是投资这一关过不了。”不少社投资中都发生了挤中农的现象。七村中农徐春庭在干部“评议”强迫下，一连几次投资。许多中农恐慌起来了。他们说：农业社是个填不满的无底洞。他们不积极经营生产，不给小春作物增加肥料，怕投资一多反把收入减少了。各村根据省委指示和县人民政府布告的精神，普遍纠正了盲目投资的现象。为了适当控制投资，全乡二十五个农业生产合作社，都按入股的田土产量，规定了适当数量的生产资金，作为全社一年的生产底垫。投资一般不超过农业总收入的百分之二十五；并规定以种籽、自然肥料等实物投资为主，现金投资只占投资总数的百分之二十至四十。对于投资现金超过规定的社员，超过部分都按信用合作社规定的利率给计算利息。提倡“勤俭办社”以后，许多社都改变了盲目地修盖牛棚、猪圈和增施商品肥料的计划。为保证今年水稻增产百分之五，“集建”社重新修订了计划，积极挖掘潜力，改进耕作技术，扩大积肥十余万斤，同时还加强小春作物田间管理，争取麦子、油菜的丰收。
