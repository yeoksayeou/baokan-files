Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 9th: According to TASS, the First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Head of the Soviet Government Delegation, L.M. Kaganovich, delivered a speech on May 8th at the celebration rally in Prague marking the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Army.

Kaganovich first extended congratulations from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Council of Ministers, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet people to the Czechoslovak people on Victory Day.

Kaganovich then said that the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia coincides with a historic day—the tenth anniversary of the epoch-making victory of the Soviet people and their heroic armed forces over Hitlerite Germany. Unfortunately, the world situation after the victory over Hitler did not lead to an era of lasting peace that the people had hoped for. The day after the war ended, the imperialist countries, who had fought against Hitlerite imperialism but dreamed of becoming its successors, began to plot conspiracies against peace and against peace-loving peoples of all countries.

The American imperialists put forward the "Marshall Plan" in an attempt to use this plan to—if one can put it that way—change the course of post-war history and enslave some countries.

As everyone knows, the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies that were with it, including the Czechoslovak Republic, rejected this kind of “aid” and restored their war-damaged economies with their own strength, greatly exceeding pre-war levels, far ahead of the Marshallized countries.

Let us take Czechoslovakia and France as an example for comparison. Here are a few comparative figures: Taking the industrial production index of Czechoslovakia and France in 1937 as 100, by 1950, Czechoslovakia's production index was 145, and France's was 124; by 1954, Czechoslovakia's was 220, and France's was 154.

In 1954, Czechoslovakia's pig iron production increased by 66.7 percent compared to 1937, while France only increased by 13 percent; Czechoslovakia's steel production increased by 89.7 percent accordingly, while France only increased by 34 percent; Czechoslovakia's rolled metal output rose by 69.6 percent, while France's was 30 percent.

Kaganovich said: The Czechoslovak Republic is becoming an increasingly powerful force within the great camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

Kaganovich said that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democracies are welcoming the tenth anniversary of the victory over German and Japanese imperialism with their own growing strength and power. Fifteen years ago, on the eve of World War II, the Soviet Union was the only socialist country, surrounded on all sides by capitalist countries. The armed-to-the-teeth German-Italian fascist imperialism and Japanese imperialism peered at the Soviet Union from the West and East, respectively, preparing to invade the Soviet Union.

The imperialists of Britain, the United States, and France not only supported them and instigated them, but the imperialists of Britain, the United States, and France themselves were also sharpening their swords and preparing to plot against the Soviet Union. They organized a fourteen-nation armed intervention, trying to strangle the young Soviet state. However, as everyone knows, history mercilessly mocked them. There is no doubt that their attack on the People's Republic of China, including the illegal occupation of Taiwan, will also be ridiculed by history.

Speaking about the international situation, Kaganovich said that in the past ten years, the Soviet Union has achieved considerable success in implementing a policy of striving for peace and security, and easing international tensions.

The recent Soviet-Austrian negotiations in Moscow were a great contribution by the Soviet Union to the struggle for peace and security. Thanks to the Soviet Union's peace initiatives, a satisfactory solution to the Austrian peace treaty issue is not far off.

The recent Asian-African Conference in Bandung, Indonesia, once again vividly demonstrated how the lofty propositions of peace and friendship among all peoples, which the Soviet state proclaimed to the world from the very beginning, are increasingly becoming the banner of more and more working people. Speaking of the Asian-African Conference, it should be particularly pointed out that the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India have established great merits and played a prominent role in the struggle for peace, peaceful coexistence, and the easing of international tensions.

However, imperialist politicians, driven mad by constantly losing their positions, are unwilling to consider the lessons of history and are implementing plans to prepare and launch wars. As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the end of the war, a basic fact in the international situation in Europe is that the Paris Agreements have been ratified, and West Germany, which has joined the aggressive North Atlantic bloc in accordance with this agreement, is being remilitarized.

The Paris Agreements complicate the international situation. This is a serious fact, which forces the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other People's Democracies to draw all necessary conclusions so as not to be caught off guard. The meeting to be held in Warsaw on May 11th will discuss the practical implementation of the decisions of the Moscow meeting. The Warsaw meeting will be of great significance. We are convinced that the entire people of Czechoslovakia, like the people of other democratic countries, will become more vigilant and will realize all decisions aimed at strengthening the defense capabilities of the People's Democracies and the glorious army in fraternal alliance with the Soviet Union and with the support of the People's Republic of China.

Kaganovich emphasized that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the Party, and the Soviet government pay constant and particularly deep attention to further strengthening defense capabilities. The Soviet Army and Navy are a powerful force. It is able to defend the achievements of socialism and the national interests of the Soviet Union, and when friendly countries are attacked by imperialists, it is able to give the necessary assistance to friendly countries, and will forever eliminate the aggressors' attempts to undermine our peaceful and creative labor. The various measures that have been taken and will be taken do not mean that we will relax the struggle to strive for peace and prevent war, and to strive for peaceful ways to resolve outstanding international disputes. On the contrary, precisely because the imperialists are stepping up preparations for war, accelerating the expansion of armaments, inciting war hysteria and atomic mania, and remilitarizing West Germany, we must intensify the struggle to strive for consolidating security, reducing armaments, banning atomic weapons, easing international tensions, and maintaining peace among the peoples of all countries.

　　卡冈诺维奇在布拉格庆祝大会上发表演说
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社布拉格九日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席、苏联政府代表团团长拉·莫·卡冈诺维奇，五月八日在布拉格举行的苏联军队解放捷克斯洛伐克十周年庆祝大会上发表了演说。
    卡冈诺维奇首先代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议、苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联人民向捷克斯洛伐克人民祝贺胜利日。
    卡冈诺维奇接着说，捷克斯洛伐克解放十周年恰在一个有历史意义的日子——苏联人民和他们英勇的武装部队战胜希特勒德国获得划时代的胜利的十周年。不幸，在对希特勒胜利以后的世界形势，并不是人民所希望的导向一个持久和平的生活的时代。在战争结束以后的第二天，曾同希特勒帝国主义作过战但梦想成为它的继承者的帝国主义国家，就开始策划反对和平、反对爱好和平的各国人民的阴谋了。
    美帝国主义者提出“马歇尔计划”是企图借这个计划的帮助来——如果可以这样说的话——改变战后历史的方向并且奴役一些国家。
    大家知道，苏联和同它在一起的人民民主国家，包括捷克斯洛伐克共和国在内，拒绝了这种
  “援助”，并且用它们自己的力量恢复了它们的为战争所破坏的经济，而且大大超过了战前的水平，远远地走在马歇尔化国家的前面。
    让我们拿捷克斯洛伐克和法国作一个比较。这里是几个比较的数字：以一九三七年捷克斯洛伐克和法国的工业生产指数为一百，到一九五○年，捷克斯洛伐克的生产指数为一四五，法国为一二四；到一九五四年，捷克斯洛伐克为二二零，法国为一五四。
      一九五四年捷克斯洛伐克的铣铁生产比一九三七年增加了百分之六十六点七，而法国只增加了百分之十三；捷克斯洛伐克的钢的生产相应地增加了百分之八十九点七，而法国只增加了百分之三十四；捷克斯洛伐克的压延金属产量上升了百分之六十九点六，而法国是百分之三十。
    卡冈诺维奇说：捷克斯洛伐克共和国正在变为伟大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营内的一个日益强大的力量。
    卡冈诺维奇说，苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家是在自己的力量和威力蓬勃壮大的情况下迎接战胜德国和日本帝国主义十周年的。十五年前，在第二次世界大战前夕，苏联是唯一的社会主义国家，它四面受到资本主义国家的包围。武装到牙齿的德意法西斯帝国主义和日本帝国主义分别从西方和东方窥视苏联，准备进犯苏联。
    英、美、法三国的帝国主义者不仅支持了它们，并且唆使了它们，而且英、美、法三国的帝国主义者自己也在磨刀擦剑准备暗算苏联。它们曾组织了十四国武装干涉，想扼杀年青的苏维埃国家。然而大家都知道，历史无情地嘲笑了它们。毫无疑问，它们的进攻中华人民共和国、包括非法霸占台湾，也将遭到历史的嘲笑。
    卡冈诺维奇在谈到国际局势时说，十年来，苏联在执行争取和平和安全，缓和国际紧张局势的政策方面获得了不小的成就。
    不久以前在莫斯科举行的苏奥谈判是苏联对争取和平和安全的斗争的一个巨大贡献。由于苏联的和平倡议，对奥和约问题的圆满解决已经为期不远了。
    不久以前在印度尼西亚万隆举行的亚非会议又一次鲜明地证明了，苏维埃国家从立国之日起就向世界宣告的和平和各国人民友好的崇高主张，如何在日益成为越来越多的劳动人民的旗帜。说到亚非会议，应当特别指出中华人民共和国和印度共和国在争取和平、争取和平共处和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中所建立的巨大功绩和所起的卓越作用。
    但是，由于不断失去自己的阵地而丧心病狂的帝国主义政客，不愿考虑历史教训，而执行着准备和发动战争的计划。在我们庆祝战争胜利结束十周年的时候，欧洲国际局势中的一个基本事实是：巴黎协定已得到批准，加入侵略性的北大西洋集团的西德已按照这个协定在重新军国主义化。
    巴黎协定使国际局势复杂化。这是一个严重的事实，这使苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和其他人民民主国家不得不作出一切必要的结论，以免措手不及。五月十一日在华沙举行的会议将要讨论实际实现莫斯科会议决议的问题。华沙会议将具有重大的意义。我们深信，捷克斯洛伐克全体人民和其他民主国家的人民一样，将更加提高警惕，要实现一切目的在于在同苏联结成兄弟联盟下、在中华人民共和国的支持下加强人民民主国家的国防力量和光荣的军队的决定。
    卡冈诺维奇强调说，苏联共产党、党中央委员会和苏联政府对进一步加强国防力量给予经常的和特别深切的注意。苏联陆军和海军是一个强大的力量。它能够捍卫住社会主义成果和苏联的国家利益，并且在友好的国家一旦遭到帝国主义者袭击的时候，它能够给友好国家以必要的援助，并且将永远地消灭侵略者破坏我们和平创造性劳动的企图。现在已经采取的和将要采取的各种措施决不意味着我们会放松争取和平和防止战争以及争取寻求和平途径来解决悬而未决的国际争端的斗争。恰恰相反，正因为帝国主义者在加紧准备战争，加速扩充军备，煽动战争歇斯底里和原子狂，并且使西德重新军国主义化，所以我们就更要加紧斗争来争取巩固安全、裁减军备、禁止原子武器、缓和国际紧张局势以及维护各国人民之间的和平。
