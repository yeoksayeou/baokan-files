　　“For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!” Publishes Commentary
　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 4th. The latest issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" commented on the Asian-African Conference, stating that the Asian-African Conference is a valuable contribution to the cause of peace and international cooperation. The commentary said that the convening of this conference reflects the enormous changes that have taken place in this part of the world since World War II. The conference demonstrated the desire of the Asian-African people to take their destiny into their own hands and independently resolve major issues in their internal affairs and foreign policy.
　　The commentary said, however, that colonialists, especially the ruling groups in the United States, feared that the Asian-African people would unite and take concerted action in the struggle for national liberation and democratic freedom. They tried every means to obstruct the convening and success of the conference, such as plotting to sabotage aircraft, and trying to influence the work of the conference through the delegations of certain countries directly dependent on the United States.
　　The commentary said that there is no doubt that the Bandung Conference embodied the hopes of peace-loving people. The conference gave the colonial rule of imperialist countries another blow, and helped promote and strengthen understanding between the Asian-African people, and promoted the struggle of these people to ease international tensions and strive for world peace.
　　All-India Peace Council Calls for "Bandung Day"
　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 4th. Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, issued a statement in New Delhi on the 3rd, calling on the Indian people to hold "Bandung Day" on May 15 to express their support for the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference and their determination to promote the unity of the Asian-African people. The statement said that the Bandung Conference was a victory for the will of the Asian-African people to fight for peace and freedom. It was a huge failure for the imperialist countries and their despicable plans to continue to rule and exploit Asia and Africa. The statement also said that every Indian hopes for greater and greater cooperation between India and China. This cooperation can make a powerful contribution to world peace.
　　American "Worker's Daily" and "People's World" Publish Editorials
　　According to Xinhua News Agency, the New York "Worker's Daily" published an editorial on April 26, commenting on the achievements of the Asian-African Conference, saying that the unity achieved by the twenty-nine countries participating in the historic Asian-African Conference set an example for the world.
　　The editorial said that the Bandung Conference proved that countries with different economic systems and political ideologies can coexist peacefully. The editorial said that the Asian-African Conference defeated the US State Department's activities to divide and split the delegations of various countries, which was a contribution to the cause of peace. The State Department's henchmen originally wanted to use anti-communism as a problem to poison the atmosphere of the Bandung Conference. But they failed shamefully.
　　The San Francisco "People's World" published an editorial on April 27, saying that despite the unprecedented efforts of the United States to undermine the Asian-African Conference, the representatives still found a basis for common agreement. The editorial said that to the achievements of the conference should also be added the remarkable efforts of Premier Zhou Enlai to propose direct negotiations to resolve the Taiwan crisis.

　　欢迎亚非会议的重大成就
　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”发表评论
    新华社布拉格四日电　最近一期的“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”评论亚非会议说，亚非会议是对和平事业和国际合作的宝贵的贡献。评论说，这个会议的召开反映了第二次世界大战以来世界的这个部分发生的巨大的变化。这个会议证明了亚非人民的这种愿望：把他们的命运掌握在他们自己的手中和独立地解决他们内政和外交政策上的主要问题。
    评论说，但是，殖民者，特别是美国统治集团害怕亚非人民会团结起来，在争取民族解放和民主自由的斗争中采取一致行动。他们想尽办法来阻挠会议的召开和取得成就，例如，策划破坏飞机的阴谋，设法通过某些直接依赖美国的国家的代表团来影响会议的工作。
    评论说，毫无疑问，万隆会议是体现了爱好和平人民的希望的。会议给予帝国主义国家的殖民主义又一次的打击，并且有助于促进和加强亚非人民之间的了解，推动这些人民为缓和国际紧张局势，争取世界和平而进行的斗争。
　　全印和平理事会号召举行“万隆日”
    新华社新德里四日电　全印和平理事会主席赛福丁·克其鲁博士三日在新德里发表声明，号召印度人民在五月十五日举行“万隆日”，表示支持亚非会议的决议，并且决心促进亚非人民的团结。声明说，万隆会议是亚非人民争取和平和自由的意志的胜利。它是帝国主义国家和它们企图继续统治和剥削亚非两洲的卑鄙计划的巨大失败。声明又说，每个印度人都希望印度中国之间进行越来越大的合作。这种合作能够对于世界和平作出有力的贡献。
　　美国“工人日报”和“人民世界报”发表社论
    据新华社讯　纽约“工人日报”四月二十六日发表社论，评论亚非会议的成就说，参加具有历史意义的亚非会议的二十九个国家所实现的团结，为全世界建立了一个范例。
    社论说，万隆会议证明，具有不同经济制度和政治思想的国家是可以和平共处的。社论说，亚非会议击败了美国国务院要分化和分裂各国代表的活动，这是对和平事业的一个贡献。国务院的走卒们本来想用反对共产主义作为毒化万隆会议气氛的问题。但是他们可耻地失败了。
    旧金山“人民世界报”四月二十七日发表社论说，尽管美国作了空前的努力要破坏亚非会议，代表们仍然找到了共同协议的基础。社论说，在会议的成就上，还应当加上周恩来总理建议举行直接谈判以解决台湾危机的引人注目的努力。
