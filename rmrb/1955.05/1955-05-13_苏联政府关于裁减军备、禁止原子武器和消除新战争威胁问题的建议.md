Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 11th (TASS): The full text of the Soviet government's proposals on the issue of disarmament, prohibition of atomic weapons, and elimination of the threat of a new war is as follows:

      Declaration

    To the United Nations General Assembly

    In view of the great responsibility of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace, believing that it is its duty to draw the attention of all countries to the situation currently formed in international relations.

    The people of all countries, who not long ago experienced the Second World War, which involved heavy losses of life and enormous material destruction, have never demonstrated so strongly as now an indomitable will to strive for peace.

    This deep desire for peace on the part of the people of all countries has led to the end of the bloody wars in Korea and Indochina, thereby creating more favorable conditions for resolving other outstanding international issues.

    At the same time, the people of all countries, in view of the situation currently formed in Europe and Asia, have expressed reasonable concern about the fate of peace. For example, the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung not long ago reflected this concern, and this conference is of great significance for the struggle for peace, the freedom, and independence of all peoples.

    At present, the situation in some regions of the world has not only not improved, but has become more complicated, and mutual distrust between countries has deepened. The lack of necessary trust in international relations is the main reason hindering the resolution of outstanding issues in Europe and Asia.

    The relations between the major powers, who bear the primary responsibility for maintaining universal peace and the security of all countries, are primarily in this situation.

    Despite the obligations of the major powers and other members of the United Nations to cooperate with each other in maintaining peace and international security, their relations with each other do not meet these requirements. The distrust in the mutual relations of the major powers, especially the distrust in the relations between the major powers who are permanent members of the Security Council, has created the threat of a new war after the end of the Second World War, the consequences of which will be even more serious.

    Due to this distrust, first of all, the distrust in the relations between the major powers as permanent members of the Security Council, the arms race is expanding more and more, and the number of land, sea, and air forces is constantly increasing. The highest achievements of science and technology are being used to produce the most destructive tools for killing people. The scale of the arms race is particularly large in the production of dangerous weapons such as atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    Countless foreign military bases are being built on the territories of other countries, which will cause reasonable concern to the countries close to these bases. The establishment of such bases also deepens the threat to the security of the countries where these bases are located. The existence of these bases - many of which are used by some countries to prepare for atomic warfare - is increasingly deepening the mutual distrust in international relations and aggravating international tension.

    The result of all this is that the world has been in a state of so-called "Cold War" for many years, and the burden imposed on the people of all countries by military preparations is becoming heavier and heavier.

    As early as 1947, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution condemning "any form of propaganda designed to create or increase, or capable of creating or increasing, threats to or breaches of the peace, or acts of aggression." However, in some countries, despite this resolution, new war propaganda is being openly carried out. The war cries in newspapers, radio stations, and public speeches have not only not stopped, but have become more and more frequent. Especially in recent times, the cries for atomic warfare have become particularly frequent.

    Traditional economic and trade relations between many countries for many years have been disrupted, which has had serious adverse consequences for international economic cooperation.

    The current situation requires: urgent and practical measures to ease international tension and consolidate mutual trust in international relations. This can be done as long as the "Cold War" is ended, the new war propaganda carried out by some countries is stopped, and they are prevented from inciting hostility and hatred among the people of all countries, and instigating the people of some countries against the people of other countries.

    The continued propaganda and war cries aimed at inciting war hysteria by some countries can only exacerbate international tension and increase mutual distrust between countries, thereby increasing the threat of a new world war. Conversely, stopping the "Cold War" state between countries will promote the easing of international tension, facilitate the necessary trust in international relations, eliminate the threat of a new war, and create conditions for the peaceful and tranquil life of the people of all countries. This will create the necessary conditions for the implementation of a broad disarmament program and the establishment of the necessary international supervision to supervise the implementation of this program.

    For these purposes, the United Nations General Assembly:

    1. Recommends that all countries take the necessary measures to strictly implement the United Nations General Assembly's resolution condemning any form of new war propaganda, and prohibit war cries and incitement of animosity among peoples in newspapers, radio, movies, and public speeches. Any country that does not comply with this recommendation will be considered to have violated its international obligations and the obligations it has undertaken to the United Nations - not to use force or threaten to use force in international relations, and not to infringe upon the territorial integrity or political independence of any country.

    2. Notes with satisfaction the achievements made in the negotiations between the countries concerned on the Korean issue, which led to the cessation of the Korean War, and in the negotiations on the issue of the cessation of hostilities in Indochina. These achievements have eliminated two dangerous sources of war in the Far East. Due to the negotiations conducted by the countries concerned, the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Austria guaranteeing the restoration of Austrian independence has also been resolved. The resolution of the Austrian issue is a new and significant contribution to the cause of consolidating peace in Europe, and it helps to create conditions for the satisfactory resolution of other unresolved post-war issues.

    All of this shows that the possibility of resolving outstanding international issues through negotiations between major powers, in accordance with the interests of peace, the freedom of all peoples, and national independence, has not yet been fully utilized.

    3. Believes that it is in line with the goal of easing international tensions and establishing the necessary trust between countries if the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France immediately withdraw their occupation forces stationed in Germany to their own countries, except for a very small number of troops temporarily remaining on German territory until the conclusion of an agreement on complete withdrawal. It is also in line with these goals to establish strictly limited local police forces in the two parts of Germany, and to establish joint four-power supervision over the implementation of the corresponding agreements.

    The General Assembly will welcome any other steps taken by the four powers to withdraw their troops from German territory and to facilitate the resolution of the German question in accordance with the interests of European security and the unification of Germany into a unified, peaceful, and democratic state.

    4. Believes that: The permanent members of the Security Council must reach an agreement on the abolition of military bases established by foreign countries on the territories of other countries, and notify the Security Council and the General Assembly of the results. Such an agreement would be of great significance for easing international tensions and eliminating distrust between countries, and could create the necessary conditions for stopping the arms race.

    5. Calls upon countries with experience in the production of atomic materials and atomic energy to provide extensive productive, scientific, and technological assistance to other countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy, and to provide such assistance without any political or military demands as a precondition.

    6. Calls upon the countries concerned to resolve the outstanding issues in the Far East in accordance with the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, because the existing tensions in some regions of the Far East contain the danger of a new war and are a serious threat to the maintenance of universal peace.

    7. Believes that it is necessary for countries to eliminate various discriminations in their economic relations, which hinder the development of broad economic cooperation between countries, especially in the development of trade. The situation in which trade relations that have existed between countries for a long time have been interrupted has caused losses to both private and national interests. Eliminating these discriminatory phenomena and extensively developing international trade relations based on the principle of mutual benefit will help to consolidate friendly relations between countries and promote the well-being of the people of all countries. Without eliminating these obstacles in the path of the development of international trade, it is impossible to expect to achieve genuine detente in international relations.

    Expanding international cultural exchanges, especially the extensive exchange of delegations, promoting mutual visits by people in industry, agriculture, trade, science, culture, and art, as well as exchanging student delegations, developing travel, etc., are also important ways to improve mutual relations between countries and bring countries closer together.

    8. Decides to include the question of the results of the implementation of the provisions of this declaration by all countries on the agenda of the regular sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, because: the implementation of these provisions is in line with the wishes of the people of all countries for peace, helps to establish the necessary trust between countries, and is thus conducive to the implementation of a broad disarmament program and the establishment of effective international supervision over the implementation of this program.

  On the Conclusion of an International Convention on the Reduction of Armaments and the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons

    The General Assembly (Security Council)

    In order to save mankind from the scourge of a new war, to ease tensions between countries, and to free the people of all countries from the heavy tax burden caused by the continuous expansion of armaments,

    In order to ensure that the resources released can be used to improve the welfare of the people of all countries and to provide extensive assistance to economically backward countries,

    Hereby entrusts the United Nations Disarmament Commission to draft a draft "International Convention (Treaty) on the Reduction of Armaments and the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, Hydrogen Weapons, and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction" and submit it to the Security Council for approval.

    Such a convention, aimed at consolidating peace and international security, should stipulate the following:

    1. Complete prohibition of the use and manufacture of nuclear weapons and all other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, and the use of existing nuclear weapons stockpiles for peaceful purposes;

    2. Substantial reduction of all armed forces and all conventional armaments;

    3. Establishment of a supervisory agency, giving it the necessary rights, powers, and functions to ensure that all countries equally and effectively comply with the agreed prohibitions and disarmament provisions.

    To this end, the convention (treaty) should contain the following basic principles, namely, the principles regarding the reduction of conventional armaments of all countries, the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and the procedures for the implementation of these measures in two stages.

    First Stage - Measures to be implemented in 1956.

    The following measures will be implemented in 1956:

    1. The States Parties to the Convention (Treaty) undertake the following obligations as the first step in reducing armaments and armed forces: not to increase their armed forces and conventional armaments beyond the level of armaments and armed forces as of December 31, 1954. The States Parties to the Convention shall also undertake the obligation: not to increase the appropriations for armed forces and armaments, including atomic weapons, beyond the level of appropriations for these purposes in the year ending December 31, 1954.

    The above measures shall be implemented within two months after entry into force of the relevant agreement.

    The United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France shall submit to the Disarmament Commission comprehensive official figures on their armed forces, conventional armaments, and appropriations for military needs within one month after the entry into force of the Convention (Treaty).

    2. Determine a mutually agreed level to which the armed forces of all countries exceeding this level must be reduced, so that no country possesses armed forces sufficient to seriously threaten international peace. The United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France shall substantially reduce their armed forces. For these purposes, the above five countries are obligated to reduce the number of their armed forces to no more than the following levels:

    United States - 1 million to 1.5 million;

    Soviet Union - 1 million to 1.5 million;

    China - 1 million to 1.5 million;

    United Kingdom - 650,000;

    France - 650,000.

    The five countries are obligated to reduce their conventional armaments accordingly.

    The above five countries will, based on the level of their armed forces and armaments as of December 31, 1954, and the above-mentioned reduced levels stipulated by the obligations they have undertaken, reduce 50 percent of the difference in quantity between the two within one year.

    The appropriations for armed forces and conventional armaments of all countries will be reduced accordingly.

    3. No later than the first half of 1956, a World Conference on Universal Disarmament and the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons will be convened, with the participation of members and non-members of the United Nations, to decide on the quantity of armaments and armed forces to be reduced by other countries and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    The number of armed forces that other countries can retain must, in any case, be much lower than the level stipulated for the five permanent members of the Security Council.

    When determining the quantity of armaments to be reduced by all countries - including the permanent members of the Security Council - simple, commonly agreed criteria should be taken into account, including population, geographical, economic, and political factors, with the aim of strengthening universal peace and international security and reducing the threat of aggression.

    4. As one of the primary measures to implement the program of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons must cease testing these weapons.

    In order to supervise the fulfillment of the above obligations by all countries, an international commission shall be established, which shall be responsible for reporting to the Security Council and the General Assembly.

    5. When the five major powers begin to take measures to carry out 50 percent of the agreed-upon reductions of their armaments and armed forces that are needed to reduce them to the stipulated levels, all countries should: solemnly guarantee not to use nuclear weapons before the agreement on the complete prohibition of atomic weapons comes into effect, considering nuclear weapons to be prohibited to them. Exceptions to the provisions of this article may be allowed in the case of defense against aggression, when the Security Council adopts corresponding resolutions.

    6. Countries possessing land, sea, and air force bases in other countries shall guarantee the removal of these bases.

    The question of what kind of bases should be removed in the first stage remains to be agreed upon separately.

    The implementation of these measures can promote the consolidation of the necessary trust between countries and help to implement the measures stipulated in the second stage regarding the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    Second Stage - Measures to be implemented in 1957.

    The following measures will be implemented in 1957:

    1. Immediately cease the manufacture of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and correspondingly reduce military appropriations in national budgets.

    2. The United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France will reduce the remaining 50 percent of their armed forces and armaments within one year, that is, 50 percent of the difference between the level of their armed forces and armaments as of December 31, 1954, and the reduced levels stipulated by the obligations they have respectively undertaken under the Convention. These countries will correspondingly reduce appropriations for armed forces and conventional armaments.

    During this period, the measures for reducing armaments and armed forces of other countries, the amount of which is stipulated for them by the World Conference, will also be completed.

    3. After a total of 75 percent of the armed forces and conventional armaments have been reduced in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, the agreement on the complete prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction will come into effect. The removal of these weapons from the armaments of all countries and their destruction, and the remaining 25 percent of the commonly agreed reduction in the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments, will begin simultaneously and should be completed within a certain time limit in 1957. At that time, all atomic materials will be used only for peaceful purposes.

    All countries should undertake the obligation to promote broad international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. This cooperation will also include the free exchange of information on the use of atomic energy in industry, agriculture, medicine, and other sectors of the economy and science. Special attention should be paid to providing assistance to economically backward countries. This assistance should not be conditional on any political or military demands.

    All countries should strive to use a portion of the funds saved after disarmament and the removal of nuclear weapons worldwide for the extensive peaceful use of atomic energy.

    4. Measures regarding the removal of all foreign land, sea, and air force bases in the territories of other countries should be completed.

    After all the above measures have been implemented, it is appropriate for all countries to further reduce their armaments and armed forces to the level absolutely necessary to maintain internal security and fulfill their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations.

    The issue of the obligations that China, as one of the permanent members of the Security Council, should undertake in the Convention on the Reduction of Armaments and the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, Hydrogen Weapons, and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction, should be studied with the participation of the People's Republic of China.

On the Issue of International Supervision of Disarmament and the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons

    The United Nations General Assembly recognizes that it is very important and necessary to establish effective international supervision over the obligations of all countries to implement the Convention on the Reduction of Armaments and Armed Forces and the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons and Hydrogen Weapons.

    The General Assembly points out that the necessary conditions for establishing a supervision that can gain the trust of all countries and fully meet the needs of international security do not yet exist.

    The fact that there is serious international tension and mutual distrust between countries cannot be ignored. This precisely explains why, in the current situation of international distrust, even mutual visits by delegations of industry, agriculture, science, and culture are encountering various obstacles. Due to this situation, the issue of allowing foreign supervisory personnel to enter their own enterprises, especially military production enterprises, for supervision is very difficult to agree upon.

    In the current situation where many countries are expressing legitimate concerns about their own security, it is difficult to imagine that these countries would trustfully allow other countries to approach their industrial and other resources that are of vital importance to their security.

    Since there is currently a lack of necessary trust between countries, it may create a situation in which the decisions made on international supervision will in practice become a mere formality and will not achieve their purpose. And in the current situation where the existence of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons (for which it is particularly difficult to establish international supervision) has caused great concern among the peace-loving people of all countries, the above situation is especially intolerable.

      This danger is caused by the nature of atomic production. Everyone knows that the production of atomic energy for peaceful purposes can be used to accumulate atomic explosive materials, and the amount accumulated can be more and more. This means that countries that have enterprises for atomic energy production can violate the corresponding agreements and accumulate large amounts of explosive materials for the manufacture of atomic weapons. In the presence of a considerable amount of atomic explosive materials, the manufacture of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs is technically completely feasible, and can be carried out on a large scale. If this is taken into account, then the danger of this situation is even more understandable.

      Therefore, even if a formal agreement on international supervision exists, there will be the possibility of evading supervision and secretly producing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, which international supervision cannot control. In this case, the security of the countries that signed the international convention cannot be guaranteed, because the potential aggressor will be able to stockpile atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons to launch a surprise atomic attack on peaceful countries.

      Any agreement on the establishment of international supervision will only paralyze the vigilance of the people of all countries if it does not create an atmosphere of trust in international relations. Such agreements can only create a false sense of security, while what actually exists will be the danger of producing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and therefore the danger of a sudden attack and launching an atomic war and causing the people of all countries to suffer all the terrible consequences of such a war.

      It must also be taken into account that the preparations for a new war (the danger of which has greatly increased due to the appearance of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons) inevitably make it necessary to concentrate large numbers of armed forces and large quantities of conventional armaments: aircraft, artillery, tanks, warships, etc. in certain locations. This concentration and movement of large numbers of ground armed forces, navies, and air forces can only be achieved through large central points, ports, and airports. The role of these central points in preparing for aggressive wars has not diminished but, on the contrary, is constantly increasing under modern military technology conditions.

      Once a war breaks out, in addition to atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons with great destructive power, millions of troops and large quantities of conventional armaments, which are decisive for the outcome of any major war, will inevitably be thrown into battle.

    All these circumstances must be taken into account when resolving the issue of establishing international supervision to supervise the fulfillment by all countries of the obligations they have undertaken under the Convention on the Reduction of Armaments and the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons.

    Therefore, the issue of establishing international supervision and the rights and powers of the international supervisory agency must be studied closely in connection with the implementation of the above-mentioned measures to ease international tensions, consolidate trust between countries, and implement other measures related to the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    Based on the above points,

    The United Nations General Assembly establishes an international supervisory agency with the following rights and powers:

    1. During the first stage of implementing measures to reduce armaments and prohibit atomic weapons.

    A. In order to prevent a sudden attack by one country on another, the international supervisory agency will, on the basis of mutual principles, establish monitoring stations in all major ports, railway hubs, highway routes, and airports of all relevant countries. The task of these monitoring stations is to carry out monitoring work in order to prevent dangerous concentrations of sea, land, and air forces.

    B. The international supervisory agency will have the right to require countries to provide the necessary information on the implementation of measures to reduce armaments and armed forces.

    C. The supervisory agency will have the right to unrestricted access to materials on budgetary appropriations for military aspects of all countries, including all decisions of legislative and administrative bodies of all countries on this issue. All countries should regularly report to the supervisory agency on their implementation of the various measures stipulated in the Convention (Treaty).

    2. During the second stage of implementing measures to reduce armaments and prohibit atomic weapons.

    The implementation of the measures stipulated in the above declaration, as well as the measures for reducing armaments and armed forces and prohibiting atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons stipulated for the first stage, will create the necessary atmosphere of trust between countries. Therefore, appropriate conditions for expanding the functions of the international supervisory agency will be guaranteed.

    In this case, the international supervisory agency will have the following rights and powers:

    A. To carry out supervision, including regular inspections, the scope of supervision and inspection shall be sufficient to ensure that all countries fulfill the above-mentioned Convention. In carrying out these functions, the international supervisory agency also has the right to require countries to provide the necessary information on the implementation of the reduction of armaments and armed forces.

    To carry out this inspection, a group of personnel selected according to international principles will be recruited to participate in the work.

    B. To send its inspectors to reside permanently in all signatory countries of the Convention, and the inspectors have the right to inspect all supervised objects without restriction at any time within the scope of their supervisory powers.

    In order to prevent a sudden attack by one country on another, the international supervisory agency will, on the basis of mutual principles, have monitoring stations in all major ports, railway hubs, highway routes, and airports on the territories of all relevant countries.

    C. The supervisory agency will have the right to unrestricted access to materials on budgetary appropriations for military aspects of all countries, including all decisions of legislative and administrative bodies of all countries on this issue. All countries should regularly report to the supervisory agency on their implementation of the various measures stipulated in the Convention (Treaty).

    3. The supervisory agency shall make recommendations to the Security Council on what warning and sanction measures should be taken against countries that violate the Convention on the Reduction of Armaments and the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons.

    4. In accordance with the above principles, the functions and powers of the permanent international supervisory agency should be clearly defined, and relevant instructions should be formulated for this purpose.

    The above-mentioned proposals of the Soviet government were submitted by the Soviet representative Ya. A. Malik on May 10, 1955, in London for discussion by the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission.

　　苏联政府关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的建议
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：苏联政府关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的建议，全文如下：
      宣言
    联合国大会
    鉴于联合国对维护国际和平的重大责任，认为有责任提请各国注意目前在国际关系上形成的局势。
    经历过生命损失惨重和物质破坏巨大的第二次世界大战并不太久的各国人民，从来没有现在这样强烈地表现出争取和平的不屈不挠的意志。
    各国人民这种爱好和平的深切愿望已经导致朝鲜和印度支那的流血战争的结束，从而为解决其他悬而未决的国际问题创造了较有利的条件。
    同时，各国人民有鉴于欧洲和亚洲目前形成的局势，对和平的命运表现出合理的关心。例如，不久以前在万隆举行的亚非会议的决议就反映了这种关心，这个会议对争取和平、各国人民的自由和独立的斗争有重大的意义。
    现在，世界上某些地区的情况不但没有改善，反而复杂起来，国同国之间的互不信任加深了。国际关系中缺乏必要的信任，是阻挠欧洲和亚洲的悬而未决的问题获得解决的主要原因。
    对维护普遍和平和各国安全负有主要责任的各大国之间的相互关系，首先就处于这种情况之中。
    尽管各大国和联合国其他会员国承担着在维护和平和国际安全方面互相合作的义务，但是它们彼此间的关系并不符合这些要求。各大国相互关系中的不信任，使第二次世界大战结束以后产生了其后果将更为严重的新战争的威胁。
    由于这种不信任，首先是作为安全理事会常任理事国的各大国之间的关系中的不信任，军备竞赛的规模越来越大，陆海空军的数量不断增加。科学和技术的最高成就被用于生产破坏性最大的杀人工具。在生产原子武器和氢武器这一类危险武器方面，军备竞赛的规模是特别大。
    在别的国家的领土上正在建筑着无数的外国的军事基地，这将引起接近这些基地的国家的合理的担心。这种基地的建立也加深了对这些基地所在的国家的安全的威胁。这种基地的存在——其中有许多被某些国家用来进行原子战争准备——越来越加深国际关系中的互不信任，并且加剧国际紧张局势。
    所有这一切的结果是，许多年来世界一直处于所谓“冷战”的状态中，而各国的军事准备所加在各国人民肩上的负担越来越重。
    早在一九四七年，联合国大会曾经一致通过了
  一个决议，谴责“目的在于造成或者加强、或者能够造成或者加强对和平的威胁和破坏、或者侵略行动”的任何形式的宣传。但是在一些国家内，竟不顾这一决议，公开进行新战争的宣传。报纸、广播电台和公开演说中的战争叫嚣不但没有停止，而且越来越经常了。尤其在最近时期，原子战争的叫嚣变得特别频繁了。
    许多国家之间多年来的传统的经济和贸易关系受到了破坏，这对国际经济合作产生了严重的不良后果。
    目前形成的局势要求：采取急迫和切实的措施来缓和国际紧张局势，巩固国际关系中的相互信任。只要终止“冷战”，制止某些国家所进行的新战争宣传，同时制止它们在各国人民之间煽动敌视和仇恨，唆使一些国家的人民反对另一些国家的人民，这是可以做得到的。
    某些国家继续进行目的在于煽动战争歇斯底里的宣传和战争的叫嚣，只能加剧国际紧张局势和增加各国之间的互相不信任，从而增强了新的世界大战的威胁。相反，停止各国之间的“冷战”状态，就会促进国际紧张局势的和缓，促成国际关系中的必要的信任，消除新战争威胁，为各国人民和平的和安宁的生活创造条件。这就会给实现广泛的裁军方案和建立必要的国际监督以监督这个方案的执行，创造必要的条件。
    为了这些目的，联合国大会：
    一、建议各国采取必要措施，严格执行联合国大会关于谴责任何方式的新战争宣传的决议，禁止在报刊、无线电、电影和公开演说中叫嚣战争和煽动人民间的敌对情绪。任何国家如果不遵守这项建议，将被认为是违反它的国际义务和对联合国所承担的义务——在国际关系中不用武力进行威胁或者采用武力，不容许侵犯任何国家的领土完整或者政治独立。
    二、满意地指出有关国家之间就朝鲜问题进行导致了停止朝鲜战争的谈判以及关于停止印度支那敌对行动问题的谈判中所获得的成就。这些成就消除了远东的两个危险的战争策源地。由于有关国家进行了谈判，缔结保证恢复奥地利独立的对奥和约的问题也有了解决的可能。奥地利问题的解决是对巩固欧洲和平事业的一个新的重大贡献，它有助于替圆满解决其他尚未解决的战后问题创造条件。
    这一切表明，通过大国谈判、按照和平、各国人民的自由和民族独立的利益来解决尚未解决的国际问题的可能性，还远没有利用。
    三、认为苏、美、英、法四国如果把它们驻德国的占领军，除了极少数在缔结完全撤退的协定以前还暂时留在德国领土上的部队以外，立刻撤回它们本国，那是符合缓和国际局势和树立各国之间的必要信任的目标的。在德国两部分建立员额有严格限制的地方警察部队，以及对相应的协定的执行建立四国共同监督，也是符合这些目标的。
    四国如果为了从德国领土撤退自己的军队和为了便于按照欧洲安全和使德国统一为一个统一、和平、民主的国家的利益解决德国问题而采取任何其他步骤，大会都将予以欢迎。
    四、认为：安全理事会的常任理事国必须就取消外国在别国领土上建立的军事基地达成协议，并且把结果通知安全理事会和大会。这种协议对于缓和国际紧张局势、消除国同国之间的不信任，会有重大的意义，并且可以为停止军备竞赛创造必要的条件。
    五、号召在生产原子物质和原子能方面有经验的国家在和平利用原子能方面向其他国家提供广泛的、生产上的和科学技术上的帮助，而且提供这种帮助不得以任何政治性或者军事性的要求为先决条件。
    六、号召各有关国家根据主权和领土完整的原则解决远东的悬而未决的问题，因为远东某些地区的现有的紧张局势包含着新战争的危险性，而且是对维护普遍和平的严重威胁。
    七、认为各国在它们的经济关系中有必要消除各种歧视，这些歧视阻碍了各国之间广泛的经济合作的发展，首先是贸易方面的发展。各国间曾经长期存在的贸易关系陷于中断的局面，使私人利益和国家利益都遭到损失。消除这种歧视现象，并且根据互利的原则广泛地发展国际贸易关系，将有助于巩固各国之间的友好关系和促进各国人民的福利。不消除在发展国际贸易道路上的这些障碍，就不可能指望在国际关系中达到真正的缓和。
    扩大国际文化交流，特别是广泛地互派代表团，促进工业、农业、贸易、科学、文化和艺术界人士的互相访问，以及互派学生代表团、发展旅行等等，也是改善各国间互相关系和使各国接近的重要方法。
    八、决定把各国执行本宣言条款的结果的问题列入联合国大会常会的议程，这是因为：这些条款的执行符合各国人民要求和平的愿望，有助在各国之间树立必要的信任，从而有利于实现广泛的裁军方案以及对这一方案的执行建立有效的国际监督。
  关于缔结裁减军备和禁止
    原子武器的国际公约
    大会（安全理事会）
    为了拯救人类免于遭到新战争的浩劫，缓和各国之间的紧张局势，使各国人民摆脱由于不断扩充军备而承受的沉重的赋税负担，
    为了保证使那些解脱出来的资源有可能用来提高各国人民的福利和给经济上落后的国家以广泛的援助，
    兹委托联合国裁军委员会草拟“关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约（条约）”草案，并且提交安全理事会批准。
    这样一个以巩固和平和国际安全为目的的公约，应该作下列规定：
    一、完全禁止使用和制造核子武器以及其他各种大规模毁灭性武器并且把现有的核子武器储备用在和平用途上；
    二、大量裁减一切武装部队和一切常规军备；
    三、建立一个监督机构，赋予它以应有的权利、权力和职能，以保证一切国家同样有效地遵守协议了的禁令和裁军规定。
    为此，公约（条约）应该包含下列基本原则，就是关于裁减各国常规军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的措施以及关于在两个时间内实现这些措施的程序的原则。
    第一时期——在一九五六年内实施的一些措施。
    在一九五六年内将实施下列措施：
    一、公约（条约）缔约国承担下列义务作为裁减军备和武装部队的第一个步骤：不再把它们的武装部队和常规军备增加到超过一九五四年十二月三十一日的军备和武装部队水平。公约缔约国还应当承担义务：不再把用于武装部队和包括原子武器在内的军备的拨款增加到超过截至一九五四年十二月三十一日为止的一年内用于这些目的的拨款的水平。
    上述措施在相应的协定生效以后两个月内实施。
    美国、苏联、中国、英国和法国应在公约（条约）生效以后一个月内向裁军委员会提出关于自己的武装部队、常规军备和用于军事需要的拨款的全面的官方数字。
    二、确定一个一致同意的水平，所有国家超过这一水平的武装部队都要裁减到这一水平，使没有任何一个国家拥有足以严重威胁国际和平的武装部队。美国、苏联、中国、英国和法国都要大量裁减武装部队。为了这些目的，上述五个国家有义务把自己的武装部队的人数裁减到不超过下列水平：
    美国——一百万人到一百五十万人；
    苏联——一百万人到一百五十万人；
    中国——一百万人到一百五十万人；
    英国——六十五万人；
    法国——六十五万人。
    五国有义务相应地裁减自己的常规军备。
    上述五国将以它们在一九五四年十二月三十一日的武装部队和军备的水平和它们所承担的义务所规定的上述裁减后的水平为根据，在一年之内裁减两者之间的差额数量的百分之五十。
    各国对武装部队和常规军备的拨款将相应地裁减。
    三、最迟在一九五六年上半年召开有联合国会员国和非会员国参加的世界普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器会议，以决定其他国家裁减军备和武装部队的数量和禁止原子武器。
    其他国家所能保有的武装部队人数，无论如何要大大低于替安全理事会五个常任理事国规定的水平。
    在确定各国——其中包括安全理事会的常任理事国——裁减军备的数量时，应当考虑到简单的、大家同意的准则，其中包括人口的、地理的、经济的和政治的因素，其目的是加强普遍和平和国际安全以及减少侵略威胁。
    四、作为实现裁减军备和禁止原子武器方案的首要措施之一，拥有原子武器和氢武器的国家必须停止试验这些武器。
    为了监督各国履行上述义务，成立一个国际委员会，它负责向安全理事会和大会作出报告。
    五、在五大国开始采取措施把自己的军备和武装部队进行大家所同意的、为了裁减到规定水平所需要的那种裁减的百分之五十的裁减时，各国应当：在完全禁止原子武器的协定生效之前，庄严保证不使用核子武器，认为核子武器对它们来说是被禁止的。如果为了对侵略进行防御，当安全理事会通过相应的决议的时候，可以允许对本条规定有例外。
    六、在别国领土上拥有陆、海、空军基地的国家应当保证撤除这些基地。
    关于什么样的基地应当在第一时期内撤除的问题，有待另外取得协议。
    实施这些措施能够促进巩固各国之间的必要的信任，并且有助于实施第二时期所规定的关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施。
    第二时期——在一九五七年内实施的一些措施。
    在一九五七年内将实施下列措施：
    一、立即停止制造原子武器和氢武器，相应地缩减国家预算上的军事拨款。
    二、美国、苏联、中国、英国和法国在一年内裁减自己武装部队和军备的其余的百分之五十，即它们的一九五四年十二月三十一日的武装部队和军备的水平和它们各自根据公约所承担的义务所规定的裁减以后的水平之间的差额的百分之五十。这些国家将相应地缩减用于武装部队和常规军备的拨款。
    在这一时期内，还将完成其他国家裁减军备和武装部队的措施，裁减的数额由世界会议为它们规定。
    三、在武装部队和常规军备按照公约所规定的裁减总额裁减了百分之七十五之后，完全禁止使用原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的协定就将生效。从各国军备中去除这些武器并加以销毁，裁减武装部队和常规军备的大家同意的裁减数额的余下的百分之二十五，这两项工作将同时开始进行，而且应在一九五七年内的一定时限内完成。那时所有原子物质将只用于和平目的。
    各国应当承担义务：促进在和平利用原子能方面建立广泛的国际合作。这种合作也将包括自由交换有关在工业、农业、医药以及经济和科学的其他部门中利用原子能的情报。应当特别注意给经济上落后的国家以帮助。这种帮助不应当以任何政治性或者军事性的要求为先决条件。
    各国应致力于把在世界范围内裁军和去除核子武器之后所节省下来的款项的一部分，用于广泛地和平利用原子能。
    四、关于撤除在别国领土上的所有外国的陆海空军基地的措施应当完成。
    在所有上述措施实现后，各国进一步把自己的军备和武装部队裁减到为维持内部安全和完成它们所承担的联合国宪章的义务所绝对必要的水平，是适宜的。
    中国作为安全理事会常任理事国之一，它所应承担的关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的公约中的义务问题，应当在中华人民共和国的参加下进行研究。关于对裁减军备和禁止原子武器进行的国际监督问题
    联合国大会承认，对于各国执行关于裁减军备和武装部队以及禁止原子武器和氢武器的公约的义务建立有效的国际监督，是十分重要和必要的。
    大会指出：要想现在就建立一种可以获得一切国家的信任并且完全符合国际安全需要的监督，目前还不具备必要的条件。
    不能忽视这一事实：目前存在着严重的国际紧张局势和国同国之间的互不信任。这正好说明了：为什么在目前国际间互不信任的局面之中，甚至工业、农业、科学、文化等代表团的互相访问也遭到各种障碍。由于这种情况，关于各国容许外国监督人员进入自己的企业，特别是进入军事生产企业来进行监督的问题，就很不容易达成协议。
    在现在许多国家都对自己的安全表示正当关怀的情况下，很难设想这些国家会信任地让其他国家来接近它们的对它们的安全有着切身重要意义的工业资源和其他资源。
    既然目前在国与国之间缺乏必要的信任，那就可能造成一种情况，在这种情况下作出的关于国际监督的决定将实际上流于形式，而不能达到目的。而在目前这种原子武器和氢武器（对于这种武器建立国际监督是特别困难的）的存在引起了各国爱好和平的人民极大忧虑的情况下，上述这种情况就尤其是不能容忍的。
      这种危险是由原子生产的性质所引起的。大家都知道，用于和平目的的原子能生产可以被利用来积累原子爆炸物质，而且积累数量可以越来越多。这就是说，拥有原子能生产的企业的国家可以破坏相应的协定而积累大量用来制造原子武器的爆炸物质。在有相当数量的原子爆炸物质的情况下，从技术上来说，制造原子弹和氢弹是完全可以办到的事，而且可以大规模地进行制造。如果考虑到这一点，那么这种情况的危险性就是越发可以理解的了。
      因而，甚至即使有关于国际监督的形式上的协定存在，也会有国际监督所无法控制的逃避监督和进行秘密生产原子武器和氢武器的可能性。在这种情况下，签订国际公约的各国的安全就不能得到保证，因为潜在的侵略者是会有可能储存原子武器和氢武器来对和平国家突然进行原子攻击的。
      任何关于建立国际监督的协定，在没有造成国际关系中的信任气氛之前，只会麻痹各国人民的警惕。这类协定只能造成虚假的安全感，而实际上存在的将是生产原子武器和氢武器的危险，因而也就是突然的进攻和发动原子战争并使各国人民遭受这种战争的一切可怕后果的危险。
      还不能不考虑到：新战争的准备（这种战争的危险由于原子武器和氢武器的出现而大大增加了），不可避免地使得有必要在某些地点集中大量的武装部队和大量的常规军备：飞机、大炮、坦克、军舰等。这种大量地面武装部队、海军和空军的集中和它们的调动，只有通过大的中心点、港口和飞机场才能实现。这些中心点对于准备侵略性战争的作用，在现代军事技术条件下不仅没有减少，而且恰恰相反，是在不断增加。
      一旦战争爆发，除了具有很大破坏力的原子武器和氢武器以外，对任何大战的结局都有决定意义的千百万军队和大量常规军备，也必然将投入战斗。
    在解决建立国际监督以监督各国履行根据裁减军备和禁止原子武器的公约所承担的义务这一问题的时候，必须考虑到这一切情况。
    因此，必须把关于建立国际监督以及关于国际监督机构的权利和权力的问题同执行上述的缓和国际紧张局势、巩固各国之间的信任以及实行有关裁减军备和禁止原子武器的其他办法的措施，紧密地联系起来加以研究。
    根据上述各点，
    联合国大会成立一个拥有下列权利和权力的国际监督机构：
    一、在实行裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施的第一时期。
    甲、为了防止一个国家突然进攻另一个国家，国际监督机构将根据互相的原则在所有有关国家的各个大的港口、铁路枢纽、公路线和飞机场建立监察所。这些监察所的任务是进行监视工作，以便不让海、陆、空军进行危险的集中。
    乙、国际监督机构将有权要求各国提供关于裁减军备和武装部队的措施的执行情况的必要情报。
    丙、监督机构将有权不受限制地获得有关各国军事方面预算拨款的材料，包括各国立法机构和行政机构有关这一问题的全部决定。各国应按时定期地向监督机构报告它们执行公约（条约）所规定的各项措施的情况。
    二、在实行裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施的第二时期。
    上述宣言中所规定的措施以及为第一时期规定的裁减军备和武装部队、禁止原子武器和氢武器的措施的实行，将在各国之间造成必要的信任气氛。因而扩大国际监督机构的职能的适当条件将得到保障。
    在这种情况下，国际监督机构将拥有下列权利和权力：
    甲、执行监督，包括经常性的检查，监督和检查的范围应当足以保证使各国履行上述公约。国际监督机构在执行这些职能时，还有权要求各国供给关于执行裁减军备和武装部队的必要情报。
    为执行这种检查要吸收一批根据国际原则挑选出来的工作人员参加工作。
    乙、派遣它的检查人员常驻公约所有签字国，检查人员在他们的监督职权的范围内有权在任何时间不受限制地视察所有监督对象。
    为了防止一个国家突然进攻另一个国家，国际监督机构将根据互相的原则在所有有关国家的领土上，在各个大的港口、铁路枢纽、公路线和飞机场有监察所。
    丙、监督机构将有权不受限制地获得有关各国军事方面预算拨款的材料，包括各国立法机构和行政机构有关这个问题的全部决定。各国应按时定期向监督机构报告它们执行公约（条约）所规定的各项措施的情况。
    三、监督机构就对破坏关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器公约的国家应采取怎样的警告和制裁措施，向安全理事会提出建议。
    四、根据上述原则，应当明确规定常设国际监督机构的职能和权力，并为此目的制定有关的指示。
    上述苏联政府的建议是由苏联代表雅·亚·马立克一九五五年五月十日在伦敦提交联合国裁军委员会小组委员会讨论的。
