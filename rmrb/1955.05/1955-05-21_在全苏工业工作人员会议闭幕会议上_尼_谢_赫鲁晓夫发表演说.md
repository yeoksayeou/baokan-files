Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th - According to TASS: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, delivered a speech on the 18th at the All-Soviet Industrial Workers Conference.

　　Before discussing industrial issues, Khrushchev first talked about agricultural issues. He said that the Party's decision on developing agriculture is of particularly great significance. We have every reason to hope that the tasks put forward by the Party Central Committee's January Plenary Session will be completed not in six years as planned, but in three to four years.

　　The plan stipulates that the grain sowing area this year should increase by 18,587,000 hectares compared to 1953. There is no doubt that this plan will be overfulfilled. Last year, the area of virgin and fallow land we reclaimed was not the planned 13 million hectares, but more than 17 million hectares. If we add another 2 million hectares of spring plowing land, then relying solely on reclaiming wasteland will allow us to sow about 20 million hectares of land. Assuming we only harvest 60 poods of grain per hectare, then the country will gain an additional 1.2 billion poods of grain. This is a considerable figure added to our previous harvest volume. This is something to be happy about.

　　Khrushchev said that the materials on grain production and animal husbandry prove that the resolution of the Party Central Committee's January Plenary Session is being successfully implemented. We should continue to fight tenaciously to improve agriculture, improve organizational work, and push the cause forward.

　　Khrushchev then talked about industrial issues, saying: Our industry is progressing smoothly. It can now be said that the Fifth Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule.

　　Khrushchev pointed out that our industry has enormous potential, but this potential is not being utilized enough. As long as we improve the organization of production, we can greatly increase the output of industrial products without changing the production sites and production equipment. As long as we improve the utilization of metal, we can increase the output of metal products by one and a half to two times.

　　Khrushchev emphasized that more attention must be paid to the issue of conservation in the construction sector and other production sectors.

　　Khrushchev pointed out: Strengthening the specialization of production and collaboration between various enterprises and industrial sectors is of great significance for the further development of industry. The current task is to move along the path of strengthening production specialization and broad collaboration.

　　Khrushchev said that more attention must be paid to the development of the machine tool manufacturing industry and the production of tools and auxiliary equipment. We must make every effort to improve production technology and constantly supplement various industrial sectors with the latest equipment. To achieve this, our machine tool manufacturing and tool manufacturing industries must greatly exceed the development of other industrial sectors.

　　Of course, we will continue to build new industrial enterprises in the future. But they must be built rationally, and those industrial sectors that need to be expanded must be improved and expanded. However, if we do not utilize the potential to increase production, such as renovating machine tool equipment and adopting new technologies, that is unforgivable. This is also expanding production, and expanding production in this way allows us to spend less manpower and financial resources.

　　Khrushchev paid great attention to planning issues. He pointed out that we must not only plan production on a national scale, but also plan production according to various economic regions, and make fuller use of the potential of each region.

　　When Comrade Khrushchev spoke about the task of improving planning work, he emphasized the significance of a resolution passed not long ago, saying: What we need is not only a plan for developing the national economy for one year, not only for one five-year period, but also a plan for a longer period. For some sectors, especially the power sector, long-term plans of ten to fifteen years must be formulated. The work of formulating long-term plans should be done by the State Planning Commission with the help of various scientific research institutes. The formulation of long-term plans will enable the Soviet people to constantly see the clear prospect of advancing towards communism, and will point out in what period, in which industrial sectors, and in terms of the quantity of products distributed per capita, we will surpass the most developed capitalist countries.

　　Khrushchev emphasized that it is necessary to improve the sense of responsibility of leaders at all levels of departments for formulating and completing plans, and for summarizing and promoting advanced experiences.

　　Talking about industry's tasks in developing technology, improving labor productivity, and reducing product costs, Khrushchev emphasized the special role played by the State Supervision Department and the newly established State Technology Committee.

　　Khrushchev spoke about issues such as improving labor productivity, production quotas and wages, improving product quality, and reducing product costs.

　　In his speech, he made severe criticisms of the bureaucratic phenomena in the management departments of various departments, competent authorities, and enterprises.

　　Khrushchev, in concluding his speech on the tasks of industry, talked about the high responsibility of Party organizations in industrial enterprises for improving and improving industry, and for completing state plans.

　　Next, Khrushchev talked about some issues of the current international situation. He pointed out the great significance of the Austrian State Treaty, which was signed not long ago in Vienna, on restoring the independence and democracy of Austria. He said that the settlement of the Austrian issue, achieved through the initiative of the Soviet Union, is a major contribution to easing international tensions and consolidating peace.

　　The recently announced proposals of the Soviet government on disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of new wars are a major contribution to the cause of peace. The Soviet proposals have once again dealt a blow to the conspiracies and plans of the imperialist forces.

　　Khrushchev said: Recognizing the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence of various social systems is the fundamental principle of Soviet foreign policy. Only by following these principles can normal relations and business cooperation be established between countries.

　　Those who pursue a "position of strength" policy stubbornly do not want to understand this point. They forget a simple thing: as early as the first few years of the establishment of the Soviet state, Lenin taught the Soviet people not to be intimidated by the threats of imperialism, but to give them a decisive counterattack. Lenin at that time led the Soviet people to resist the intervention of fourteen countries, and our people won the victory in this struggle. And now, when the Soviet Union is a powerful industrial country, isn't it obvious that the "position of strength" policy is bound to be completely bankrupt?

　　Khrushchev said that the upcoming talks in Belgrade between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the Republic of Yugoslavia are of great significance for easing international tensions and consolidating peace. The delegation of the Soviet people will go there with frank and sincere wishes. We have all the necessary conditions to ensure that relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, especially the national relations between the two countries, are fully normalized.

　　Khrushchev concluded by saying: Comrades! The Soviet socialist country created by the great Lenin is becoming increasingly consolidated and prosperous. Our achievements are constantly increasing and expanding. If we wisely, Bolshevik-style, and Lenin-style approach solving all the tasks we face in leading industry, agriculture, state construction, and foreign policy, then these achievements will be further expanded.

　　在全苏工业工作人员会议闭幕会议上
　　尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫发表演说
    新华社十九日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫，十八日在全苏工业工作人员会议上发表了演说。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈工业问题以前先谈到了农业问题。他说，党关于发展农业的决议具有特别重大的意义。我们有一切理由希望，党中央一月全体会议所提出的任务将不是像预定的那样在六年中完成，而是在三—四年中完成。
    计划规定在今年使谷物播种面积比一九五三年增加一千八百五十八万七千公顷。毫无疑问，这个计划将被超额完成。我们去年开垦的生荒地和熟荒地，不是预定的一千三百万公顷，而是一千七百多万公顷。如果再加上两百万公顷春耕地，那末，仅仅依靠开垦荒地就将能播种约两千万公顷土地。假定我们每一公顷土地只收获六十普特谷物，那末全国就会多获得十二亿普特谷物。这对于我们从前所有的收获量增添了一个不小的数字。这是值得高兴的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，关于谷物生产和畜牧业的材料证明，党中央委员会一月全体会议的决议正在顺利实现中。我们应当继续为提高农业而进行顽强的斗争，改进组织工作，把事业推向前进。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了工业问题，他说：我们的工业进行得很顺利。现在就可以说，第五个五年计划要提前完成。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，我国的工业有巨大的潜力，但是这些潜力还利用得不够。只要改善生产组织，我们就可以在生产场地和生产设备不变的情况下，大大增加工业品产量。只要改善金属的利用，我们就能使金属制品产量增为一倍半到两倍。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，在建设部门和其他生产部门中必须更多地注意节约问题。
    赫鲁晓夫指出：加强各企业和工业部门之间生产的专业分工和协同合作，对进一步发展工业有重大意义。目前的任务是，沿着加强生产专业分工和广泛协同合作的路线走去。
      赫鲁晓夫说，必须更多地注意母机制造工业的发展以及工具和辅助设备的生产。我们必须全力改进生产技术，不断地用最新的设备来补充各工业部门。我们要做到这一点，就必需使我们的母机制造和工具制造工业大大超过其他工业部门的发展。
    当然，我们今后也要建设新的工业企业。但是必须合理地建设，要提高并且要扩大那些需要扩大的工业部门。但是，如果我们不利用像革新机床设备、采用新的技术这种增加生产的潜力，那是不能宽恕的。这也是扩大生产，而且这样来扩大生产，我们就可以少花人力和财力。
    赫鲁晓夫非常注意计划问题。他指出，我们不仅要计划全国范围内的生产，而且也要按各个经济区域来计划生产，要更充分地利用各区的潜力。
      赫鲁晓夫同志讲到改进计划工作的任务时，着重指出不久以前通过的一个决议的意义，他说：我们需要的不仅是一年、不仅是一个五年的发展国民经济的计划，而且也要更长时期的计划。对某些部门、特别是动力部门，必须制定十年到十五年的长期计划。拟订远景计划的工作应该由国家计划委员会在各科学研究所的帮助下来做。拟订了长期计划，就能使苏联人经常看到朝着共产主义前进的明确远景，就将会指出，我们要在怎样的期限内，在那几项工业部门，就产品按人口分配的数量来说，将超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，必须提高各部领导人员对拟订和完成计划、对总结和推广先进经验的责任心。
    谈到工业在发展技术、提高劳动生产率和减低产品成本等方面的任务，赫鲁晓夫强调指出了国家监督部和新成立的国家技术委员会所起的特殊作用。
    赫鲁晓夫讲到提高劳动生产率、生产定额和工资、改善产品质量、减低产品成本等问题。
    他在讲话中，对各部、各主管机关和各企业中管理部门的官僚主义现象提出了严厉的批评。
    赫鲁晓夫在结束关于工业方面的任务的讲话时谈到了工业企业中党组织对提高和改善工业、对完成国家计划所负的高度责任。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫谈到了当前国际形势的一些问题。他指出了不久前在维也纳签订的、关于恢复独立和民主的奥地利的对奥和约的重大意义。他说，由于苏联的主动而获致的奥地利问题的解决，对于缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平是一个重大的贡献。
  最近公布的苏联政府关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁的建议对于和平事业是一个重大贡献，苏联的建议又一次打击了帝国主义势力的阴谋和计划。
    赫鲁晓夫说：承认各种社会制度和平共处的可能性和必要性，是苏联外交政策的根本原则。只有遵循这些原则才能够建立各国之间的正常关系和事务合作。
    奉行“实力地位”政策的那些人顽固地不想理解这点。他们忘记了这样一件简单的事：还在苏维埃国家成立头几年，列宁教导苏联人民不要被帝国主义的威胁吓倒，而要给他们一个决定性的回击。列宁当时领导苏联人民抵抗了十四国干涉，我国人民获得了这一斗争的胜利。而现在，当苏联是一个强大的工业国时，“实力地位”政策必然会遭到完全破产，难道这点还不明显吗？
      赫鲁晓夫说，苏联和南斯拉夫共和国的政府代表团即将在贝尔格莱德举行的会谈，对于缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平具有重大的意义。苏联人民的代表团将怀着坦率真诚的心愿去到那里。我们有一切必要的条件，保证苏联和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国之间的关系，首先是两国之间的国家关系，完全恢复正常。
      赫鲁晓夫最后说：同志们！伟大的列宁所创造的苏维埃社会主义国家在日益巩固，日益繁荣。我们的成就在不断增加和扩大。如果我们明智地、布尔什维克式地、列宁式地来着手解决我们在领导工业、农业、国家建设和外交政策方面所面临的一切任务，那末这些成就将更加扩大。
