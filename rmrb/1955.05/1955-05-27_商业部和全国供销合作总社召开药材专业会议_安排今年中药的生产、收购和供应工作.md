　　Ministry of Commerce and All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Hold Conference on Medicinal Materials
　　Arrange This Year's Production, Procurement, and Supply of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    From April 26th to May 23rd, the Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives jointly held the first National Medicinal Materials Professional Conference to comprehensively arrange this year's production, procurement, and supply of traditional Chinese medicine.
    Based on the supply, production, and sales situation of traditional Chinese medicine in various regions, the conference organized commodity circulation, balanced production and sales of more than 100 major traditional Chinese medicines such as Atractylodes macrocephala, Coptis chinensis, licorice, Chuanxiong Rhizome, Rehmannia glutinosa, and rhubarb, and conducted internal exchanges of general traditional Chinese medicines. During the conference, a total of more than 637,000 dan of medicinal materials were traded, with more than 500 varieties, totaling 63.1 million yuan in value. The varieties planned for procurement by various provinces and cities were basically resolved at the meeting. The conference criticized past erroneous ideas such as not paying attention to procurement, engaging in business only when profitable, reducing business when unprofitable, rushing for popular goods, and pushing unpopular goods.
    The conference believes that the production of Chinese medicinal materials is generally seasonal. Missing the season will make procurement difficult, which will not only affect the annual supply but also damage the production enthusiasm of farmers who grow medicinal herbs. Therefore, it requires all regions to make preparations before the production of medicinal materials to ensure procurement according to plan. During procurement, full use should be made of small urban and rural merchants and peddlers to entrust them with purchasing on behalf of the cooperatives, or to organize joint purchases under the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperatives.

　　商业部和全国供销合作总社召开药材专业会议
　  安排今年中药的生产、收购和供应工作
    商业部和中华全国供销合作总社从四月二十六日到五月二十三日联合举行了全国第一次药材专业会议，统筹安排今年中药的生产、收购和供应。
    会议根据各地中药供、产、销情况，组织了商品流转，对白术、黄连、甘草、川芎、生地、大黄等一百多种主要中药进行了产销平衡，对一般性中药进行了内部交流。会议期间，共成交药材六十三万七千多担，品种五百多种，总值六千三百一十万元。各省、市计划采购的品种，在会上基本上得到了解决。会议对过去不重视收购和有利就经营、无利少经营，抢热货、推冷货等错误思想，进行了批判。
    会议认为中药药材的生产一般都有季节性，错过季节，就不易收购，不仅影响全年供应，同时还损害种药农民的生产情绪，因此要求各地必须在药材生产前做好准备工作，保证按计划收购。在收购中，要充分利用城乡小商、小贩，委托他们代购或在供销合作社领导下组织联购。
