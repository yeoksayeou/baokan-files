Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th: TASS reports that on May 26th, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received British Ambassador Sir Hayter, U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Mr. Warmsley, and French Chargé d'Affaires Mr. Leroy and presented them with a note from the Soviet government regarding the convening of a four-power summit conference. This note was a reply to the notes of the U.S., British, and French governments of May 10, 1955.

The notes of the U.S., British, and French governments of May 10th stated that the three governments believed that the time had come for renewed efforts to resolve the major problems facing us. Therefore, we invite the Soviet government to work with us to eliminate the causes of conflict between us. In their notes, the U.S., British, and French governments proposed considering these issues in two stages. First, a meeting of heads of government with the participation of foreign ministers would be held, in which the heads of government would not set themselves the goal of reaching agreement on substantive decisions regarding the major difficulties facing the world. However, their meeting could lay the foundation for the detailed work that must be completed in the future. The heads of government could list the issues to be considered and could reach agreement on the methods to be adopted to resolve these issues. To assist the heads of government in their work, the foreign ministers would meet in the same location shortly before the heads of government's meeting. In the second stage, these issues would be carefully considered through methods, institutions, and participants appropriate to the nature of the issues on the agenda. This work should be carried out as soon as possible after the heads of government's meeting. The U.S., British, and French governments suggested that the time and place of the heads of government's meeting could be decided by the foreign ministers through diplomatic channels or other means.

The Soviet government's reply to the U.S., British, and French governments stated that the Soviet government takes a positive attitude towards holding a four-power summit meeting, believing that such a meeting would certainly help to ease international tension and strengthen mutual trust in relations between countries. The Soviet government believes that a meeting between leading politicians can help create the conditions necessary for resolving outstanding international issues if all parties concerned have a sincere desire to do so.

The Soviet government's note pointed out that the Soviet government put forward its proposals on the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of a renewed war on May 10th. If corresponding agreements are reached on these issues, first among the major powers, it would be possible to stop the current arms race (including atomic and hydrogen weapons), reduce the increasing burden of military expenditure on the people of all countries, and provide conditions for the peaceful and stable life of the people of all countries.

The note stated that the Soviet government therefore agreed with the U.S., British, and French governments' suggestion to hold a four-power summit meeting with the participation of foreign ministers in the near future.

The note then pointed out that the Soviet government could not but take note of certain remarks made by U.S. government leaders after the Soviet government had received the aforementioned notes. These remarks indicated that although the U.S. government favored convening a four-power summit meeting, it viewed the meeting "from a position of strength," which revealed an intention to exert unacceptable pressure on the meeting. U.S. leaders even declared the need to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, while at the same time launching various attacks on the people's democratic countries that are defending the freedom and independence of their people. Such attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries should be regarded as a manifestation of the aggressive ambitions of certain groups aimed at continuing to intensify the arms race, pursuing the "Cold War," and further exacerbating international tension, and must be rejected. Such remarks cannot but be regarded as a tendency to diminish the significance of the proposal to convene a four-power meeting. Thus, the U.S. government, on the one hand, expresses its willingness to organize a four-power summit meeting to consider outstanding international issues, but on the other hand, it is already implementing a plan that dooms the four-power meeting to failure. This can only be interpreted as: contrary to its own declarations, the U.S. government is obviously not genuinely striving to resolve pressing international problems. In this situation, the four-power meeting will not only fail to produce the positive results that the people of all countries naturally hope it will produce, but on the contrary, if the meeting fails due to the ongoing machinations, it will have the effect of deepening divisions between the major powers and further aggravating the international situation.

The note stated that the Soviet government still believes that the task of the four-power summit meeting is to ease international tension and strengthen mutual trust between countries. This goal can only be achieved if all countries concerned work towards it. Only under these circumstances can the heads of government meeting produce positive results.

The note concluded by saying that, regarding the issues to be studied at the meeting, the heads of government, taking into account the above circumstances, can decide the scope of the issues and the methods for resolving them themselves, and give corresponding instructions to the foreign ministers. The Soviet government believes that the city of Vienna would be the most suitable location for the meeting, and the timing of the meeting is subject to further agreement.

　　关于召开四国政府首脑会议问题
　  苏联政府复照英美法三国政府
    新华社二十七日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：五月二十六日，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫接见了英国大使海特尔爵士、美国临时代办华姆斯莱先生和法国临时代办勒罗瓦先生，交给他们苏联政府关于召开四国政府首脑会议的照会一件，这个照会是答复美、英、法三国政府一九五五年五月十日的照会的。
    美、英、法三国政府五月十日的照会说：三国政府认为，重新努力来解决我们面临的重大问题的时候已经到来，因此，我们邀请苏联政府和我们一起努力来消除造成我们之间的冲突的原因。美、英、法三国政府在照会中建议分两个阶段来考虑这些问题。首先举行一个有外交部长参加的政府首脑会议，在这个会议中，政府首脑们将不为自己定下这样的目标，就是要就关于世界面临的主要困难问题的实质性决定达成协议。但是，他们的会议可以为今后必须完成的细节工作打下基础，政府首脑们可以列出将予审议的问题，并可以就为求得这些问题的解决所应该采用的方法取得协议。为了协助政府首脑们进行工作，外交部长们在政府首脑会议以前不久在同一地点开会。在第二阶段，这些问题将通过从议事日程上的问题的性质看来是适当的方法、机构和参加者予以仔细的考虑。这一工作应该在政府首脑会议以后尽早进行。美、英、法三国政府建议政府首脑会议的时间和地点可以由外交部长们通过外交途径或者其他途径来决定。
    苏联政府给美、英、法三国政府的复照说：苏联政府对于举行四国最高级会议采取积极的态度，认为这种会议一定会有助于缓和国际紧张局势和加强国与国之间的关系中的相互信任。苏联政府相信，居于领导地位的政治家之间的会议能够有助于创造为解决悬而未决的国际问题所必需的条件，如果一切有关方面都有希望做到这一点的真诚愿望的话。
    苏联政府的照会指出：苏联政府在五月十日提出了它对裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁的问题的主张。如果就这些问题首先在大国之间达成相应的协议，那就有可能停止目前的军备竞赛
  （包括原子武器和氢武器在内），减轻各国人民日益加重的军费负担，并且为各国人民的和平和安定的生活提供条件。
    照会说：因此，苏联政府表示同意美、英、法三国政府关于在最近的将来举行有外交部长参加的四国政府首脑会议的建议。
    照会接着指出：但是，苏联政府同时不能不注意到美国政府领袖们在苏联政府已经收到了上述照会以后所发表的一些言论。这些言论中指出，美国政府虽然赞成召开四大国最高级会议，但却“从实力地位出发”来看待这个会议，这就泄露了要对会议行使不能允许的压力的意图。美国领袖们甚至宣称有必要干涉其他国家内政，在发表这类言论的同时并且还对正在保卫它们人民的自由和独立的人民民主国家进行了各种攻击。这种要想干涉其他国家内政的企图应当被认为是某些集团目的在于继续加紧军备竞赛、推行“冷战”和进一步加剧国际紧张局势的侵略野心的一种表现，必须加以摒斥。这类言论不能不被认为是一种贬低召开四大国会议的主张的意义的倾向。美国政府就这样一方面表示愿意组织一个四大国政府首脑会议来考虑悬而未决的国际问题，但另一方面却已经在实行这种使四大国会议注定要失败的计划了。这只能被解释为：美国政府同它自己的声明相反，显然并不真正努力争取解决迫切的国际问题。在这种情况下，四大国会议不仅将不会产生各国人民自然希望它会产生的积极结果，而且相反地，如果这个会议由于已在进行着的策划而遭到失败，将会产生加深大国间的分歧和使国际局势更为严重的作用。
    照会说：苏联政府仍然认为四大国最高级会议的任务是要缓和国际紧张局势，增强国与国之间的相互信任。只有所有有关国家都为此努力，这个目标才能达到。只有在这种情况之下，政府首脑会议才能产生积极的结果。
    照会最后说：关于会议上将要研究的问题，政府首脑们在考虑到上述情况后可以自己决定问题的范围和解决这些问题的方法，并且给外长们以相应的指示。苏联政府认为维也纳市将是举行会议最适合的地点，举行会议的时间问题有待进一步的协议。
