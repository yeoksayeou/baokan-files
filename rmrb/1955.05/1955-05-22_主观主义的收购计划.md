Subjective Acquisition Plan
To the Editor:
　　The Inner Mongolia District Company of the China Native Produce Company issued its commodity circulation plan for the first quarter of 1955 to its directly affiliated companies in mid-February. The directly affiliated companies then allocated the plan targets to their subordinate branch companies, by which time it was already mid-March. The first quarter was almost over.

　　Let's put aside the late issuance of the plan for the moment; the content of the plan is also not in line with the actual situation. In terms of medicinal material acquisition, the first quarter plan stipulated that the Hulunbuir League Native Produce Company should acquire 500 dan of licorice root, 300 dan of astragalus, and 140 dan of bitter almonds. The manager of the Hulunbuir League Native Produce Company said upon receiving the plan: "The higher authorities require us to acquire medicinal materials, but our League does not produce astragalus at all. As for licorice root, it is covered with ice and snow everywhere, and the villagers cannot dig it up. As for bitter almonds, the apricot blossoms haven't even bloomed, and it's not the acquisition season. Where are the almonds supposed to come from? This plan is simply impossible to execute..."

　　It is said that this plan was issued after being approved at the district company's administrative meeting, and the relevant business section chiefs and managers did not raise any objections. And the Planning Department of the Inner Mongolia Commercial Department surprisingly didn't have any "opinions" either. This is a very strange thing.

　　For several years, the central and local commercial departments have been emphasizing the importance of conducting thorough investigations and research, and understanding production and sales conditions. Why did the Inner Mongolia District Native Produce Company still produce such a plan?

### 主观主义的收购计划

　　主观主义的收购计划编辑同志：
    中国土产公司内蒙区公司一九五五年第一季度的商品流转计划在二月中旬才下达各直属公司，直属公司再把这个计划指标分配给所属支公司，时间已经是三月中旬。第一季度快要完了。
    计划发得迟，暂且不去说它，而计划的内容也不合乎实际情况。在药材类收购方面，第一季度计划规定呼伦贝尔盟土产公司收购甘草五百担、黄芪三百担；苦杏仁一百四十担。呼伦贝尔盟土产公司经理接到这个计划说：“上级规定我们收购药材，我盟却根本不产黄芪，而甘草呢？到处被冰雪封盖着，老乡们根本不能刨采。苦杏仁吧，杏花都没开，又不是收购季节，那来的杏仁呢？这个计划实在没法执行……。”
    据说，这个计划是在区公司行政会议通过以后才下达的，有关的业务科长们和经理并没有提出反对的意见。而内蒙商业部计划处居然也没有什么
  “意见”。这是很奇怪的事情。
    几年来，中央和各地的商业部门一直在强调要做好调查研究，要了解产销情况，为什么内蒙区土产公司还会编制出这样的计划呢？
