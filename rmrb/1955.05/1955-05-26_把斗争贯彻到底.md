　　Carry the Struggle Through to the End
　　Li Bozhao
    After reading the two batches of materials regarding the Hu Feng anti-Party clique revealed in the People's Daily, I could hardly contain the anger in my heart. These "materials," in Hu Feng's own words, eloquently accused Hu Feng's reactionary clique of monstrous crimes; these "materials" demonstrated that Hu Feng was a counter-revolutionary aiming to overthrow our people's revolutionary regime. All revolutionaries should wage a resolute struggle against Hu Feng and the Hu Feng reactionary clique!
    Wasn't Hu Feng always claiming to be "Lu Xun's successor," a "left-wing writer," a "Marxist literary theorist," and "an organizer of literary work standing around the Party"? But the materials prove the opposite. It turns out that he has consistently and systematically been waging war against the literary and artistic cause led by the Party, and he harbors such intense hatred for the Party and the people.
    Weren't Hu Feng and the members of his anti-Party clique always flaunting the banner of defending the Marxist literary and artistic theoretical principles? But the "materials" prove the opposite. It turns out that their use of revolutionary terminology was merely "to become 'masters' before starting to write, and then fight with the 'masters' they had become"; it was merely "to stand firm on 'stance' in 'words'."
    When people exposed the reactionary essence of Hu Feng's "theories," Hu Feng immediately wrote "My Self-Criticism," stating: "I feel regretful remorse. I deeply feel that I have let down the people, let down the Party and the cause of the class, let down the great era," hoping "to transform myself under the leadership of the Party, study hard, and strive to work hard, in order to gradually alleviate the pain of debt brought about by my past mistakes." It seemed truly sincere, pretending to repent sincerely! But the "materials" prove the opposite. It turns out that his self-criticism was only "to seek rebirth in endurance, everything is for the cause, for a greater future!"
    What is this? This is a specimen of the most insidious and most despicable counter-revolutionary double-dealer.
    Since the truth is such, then our struggle with Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique is not merely a struggle within the scope of literary issues, nor is it merely a struggle on the ideological front, but a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. This should be a serious struggle, a struggle to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionary elements within the revolutionary ranks.
    The exposure of the Hu Feng reactionary clique has educated many of us, and we must draw profound lessons from the facts of the Hu Feng clique's conspiracy activities. We must be clear that counter-revolutionaries are accustomed to using double-dealing tactics to deceive the Party and the people in order to harm the working class and its political party. Therefore, we must raise serious vigilance, be good at identifying those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose it; and we must cleanse them from all our fronts to defend the great victories we have already achieved and will achieve.
  　We must carry the struggle against Hu Feng and his clique through to the end. We must thoroughly expose the anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes of this group of conspirators and thoroughly clarify the political background of this clique. As for the members of the Hu Feng small clique, since this clique is a led, strategic, and resolutely anti-Party and anti-people counter-revolutionary organization, those who have participated in such an organization should continue to expose its counter-revolutionary crimes. Any illusions or waiting is wrong. As the "People's Daily" editor's note on May 13th said: "Stripping off the mask, exposing the truth, helping the Party thoroughly clarify the entire situation of Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique, and becoming a true person from now on, is the only way out for Hu Feng and every member of the Hu Feng faction."

### 把斗争贯彻到底

　　把斗争贯彻到底
　　李伯钊
    读了人民日报揭露的关于胡风反党集团的两批材料以后，实在抑止不住心里的愤怒。这些“材料”，以胡风自己的笔墨、极其雄辩地向人民告发了胡风反动集团的滔天罪行；这些“材料”说明了胡风是以企图推翻我人民革命政权为目的的反革命分子。一切革命的人都应该同胡风和胡风反动集团进行坚决的斗争！
    胡风自己不是一向以“鲁迅的继承者”、“左翼作家”、“马克思主义文艺理论家”、“站在党底周围的文学工作的组织者”自命吗？可是材料却证明了另一方面的事实。原来他是一贯地、有计划地向党所领导的文艺事业作战的，他对于党和人民是抱着如此强烈的深仇大恨。
    胡风及其反党集团的分子们不是一向以保卫马克思主义的文艺理论原则相标榜吗？可是“材料”却证明了另一方面的事实。原来他们所以要使用革命的术语，不过是“在下笔前先变成老爷们，再来和变成了老爷们的自己作战”；不过是“为了‘字面’上要站稳‘立场’”而已。
    当人们揭穿了胡风那些“理论”的反动实质后，胡风立刻写了“我的自我批判”，表示：“感到了悔恨性的内疚。我沉痛地感到辜负了人民，辜负了党和阶级事业，辜负了伟大的时代”，希望“在党底领导下面改造自己，努力学习，并争取努力工作，以求逐渐解除我过去的错误所带来的负债的痛苦。”看来真是真心诚意，假装要痛改前非的样子！可是“材料”却证明了另一方面的事实。原来他的检讨不过是为了“在忍受中求得重生，一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来！”
    这是什么？这是最阴险的、最卑鄙的反革命两面派的标本。
    真相既然如此，那么，我们同胡风及其反革命集团的斗争，就不仅仅是在文艺问题范围内的斗争，也不仅仅是思想战线上的斗争，而是革命同反革命的斗争。这应当是一场严重的斗争，是为在革命队伍内部清除反革命暗藏分子的斗争。
    对胡风反动集团的揭露，教育了我们许多人，我们必须从胡风集团的阴谋活动这一事实中，取得深刻的经验教训。我们必须明确反革命都是惯于使用两面派的手段来欺骗党、欺骗人民，以便有可能来危害工人阶级和它的政党的。因此，我们必须引起严重的警惕，要善于辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子；要把他们从我们各个战线上清洗出去，以保卫我们已经取得的和将要取得的伟大胜利。
  　我们一定要把对胡风及其集团的斗争贯彻到底。一定要把这一群阴谋分子的反党、反人民、反革命的罪行彻底揭露，非把这个集团的政治背景彻底弄清不可。对于胡风小集团的分子来说，既然这个集团是有领导的、有策略的坚决反党反人民的反革命组织，参加了这样的组织的人就应继续揭发它的反革命罪行。任何幻想或等待都是错误的。正如五月十三日“人民日报”编者按语中所说的：“剥去假面，揭露真相，帮助党彻底弄清胡风及其反党集团的全部情况，从此做个真正的人，是胡风及胡风派每一个人的唯一出路。”
