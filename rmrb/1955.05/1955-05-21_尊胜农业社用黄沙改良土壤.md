　  Zunsheng Agricultural Cooperative Uses Yellow Sand to Improve Soil
    During the spring plowing, members of the Zunsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zunsheng Township, Santai County, Sichuan Province, while discussing how to tap the potential of the land, some suggested mobilizing everyone to dig sand from the mountains to fertilize the fields, based on past experiences where the use of yellow sand occasionally increased crop yields. Wang Da'an, the Party Branch Secretary and head of the agricultural cooperative, also sent a letter and two packages of yellow sand to the Sichuan Agricultural Science Research Institute in Chengdu, asking scientists for help with research. Chemical analysis proved that the yellow sand contained 30% phosphorus and potassium. Using yellow sand could not only fertilize the fields, but also improve mountain soil when mixed with dirt, thereby increasing crop yields. The results of the analysis further encouraged all cooperative members. Therefore, male and female team members from twelve production teams immediately mobilized to dig sand on the mountains. In half a month, they carried and spread more than 40,000 catties of yellow sand on more than 300 mu of hillside land, gradually transforming the thin and infertile cultivated land into fertile farmland, and it is expected that the yield of sweet potatoes per mu will increase by more than double.

　  尊胜农业社用黄沙改良土壤
    春耕中，四川省三台县尊胜乡尊胜农业生产合作社的社员们，在讨论挖掘土地潜力时，有人根据过去偶然用黄沙可以提高作物收获的经验，建议发动大家到山上挖沙肥田。党支部书记、农业社长王达安，并写信寄了两包黄沙到成都四川农业科学研究所，请科学家们帮助研究。经化验证明，黄沙中含有百分之三十的磷和钾，用黄沙不仅可以肥田，而且和泥土混合后可以改良山地土壤，提高作物产量。化验的结果，更鼓舞了全体社员。于是十二个生产队的男女队员们，立即动员上山挖沙，半个月中，往三百多亩山坡地里挑铺了四万多斤黄沙，把薄瘠的耕地逐渐改变成肥沃的良田，预计每亩红薯可提高产量一倍多。　（本报驻重庆记者）
