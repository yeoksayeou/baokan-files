Consolidating Agricultural Production Cooperatives Must Implement the Principle of Voluntariness
    Kan Feng
    In the current work of consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, many rural cadres are afraid to publicize the principle of voluntariness in the agricultural cooperation movement to the masses. Recently, in Lushan County, Henan Province, I heard more than once of situations like this: some cadres were sent to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives with many members requesting to withdraw from the cooperative. After arriving at the cooperative, instead of first publicizing the principle of voluntariness, they first held a meeting to announce: according to the cooperative's charter, joining or withdrawing from the cooperative must be done during the year-end profit distribution season; now, no one is allowed to withdraw from the cooperative. Then, they led the members to "examine their minds and find the reasons," analyze and criticize the idea of withdrawing from the cooperative, and label the members who wanted to withdraw with a "capitalist" "hat."
    Why are they so afraid to publicize the principle of voluntariness? Because these cadres mistakenly believe that: in the current situation where the ideological mood of some members in the cooperative is unstable, if the principle of voluntariness is implemented and farmers are allowed to withdraw freely, they will withdraw en masse, causing setbacks to the agricultural cooperation movement. Therefore, in order to consolidate the agricultural production cooperatives, a mandatory method must be adopted to "tie" all the farmers who have joined the cooperative to the cooperative, "blocking this gap."
    What is the reality? All those who have adopted this method of consolidating agricultural production cooperatives have failed. In many cooperatives, when the cadres in charge of consolidation were still there, there was a temporary illusion of "enthusiastically" engaging in production; however, as soon as the consolidation cadres left, the truth was revealed: the members who originally wanted to withdraw were still clamoring to withdraw; even the members who did not want to withdraw complained: this cooperative will never be successful! The cadres come and only put big labels on us, without helping us solve specific problems. It would be better to break up sooner rather than later!
    In fact, earnestly implementing the principle of voluntariness will not only not weaken the existing socialist position in the countryside, but will also further enhance the production enthusiasm and mutual aid and cooperation enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers outside the cooperative, creating favorable conditions for the development of the agricultural cooperation movement. The process of the Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shangwa Village, Lushan County, from near collapse to consolidation, is a good example.
    When this cooperative was established last fall, the district cadres leading the establishment of the cooperative not only did not conduct in-depth ideological mobilization, but also used coercive measures against some middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants who were firmly unwilling to join the cooperative at the time. He threatened the middle peasant Duan Fushun to his face, saying: "Now cooperatives are being established all over the country. If you don't join the cooperative, it will affect the establishment of the cooperative in our village, and you will be responsible!" The well-to-do middle peasant Li Jianxiang saw that he had to join the cooperative, so he said to the district cadre: he was willing to join the cooperative, but he had no way to repay a hundred yuan of old debt. The district cadre immediately agreed: "After joining the cooperative, the cooperative will give you one hundred yuan." After the cooperative was established, production did not get on track for a long time, and the problems in the cooperative were not resolved in time. Some members who were not originally forced to join were afraid that their future income would decrease and were unwilling to stay in the cooperative. From the establishment of the cooperative last fall to the beginning of spring plowing this year, for more than half a year, there were three successive waves of mass demands to withdraw from the cooperative. In the past, whenever there were disturbances, the local CPC District Committee sent cadres to lead the consolidation; but each time the cadres sent did not publicize and implement the principle of voluntariness at all, fearing that it would collapse the cooperative. Therefore, the problems in the cooperative have been delayed and not resolved. This time, the CPC Lushan County Committee sent Wang Songgen, Deputy Secretary of the County Committee, to guide the consolidation of the cooperative. After Wang Songgen arrived at the cooperative, he analyzed the reasons why the cooperative was not consolidated, mainly because the principle of voluntariness was not implemented. Therefore, farmers who were still unwilling to stay in the cooperative after education should be allowed to withdraw from the cooperative. He first convened a forum of poor peasant members and meticulously conducted education on the socialist future and the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives. Some poor peasant members who originally wanted to run the cooperative wholeheartedly were half-hearted because they saw that the problems in the cooperative could not be solved for a long time; after this education, they all improved their ideological awareness and expressed their determination to run the cooperative well. At this meeting, he carefully analyzed the ideological situation of all the members of the cooperative and found that among the original forty-three members of the cooperative, at least fourteen were determined to stay in the cooperative; if the work was done well, it could reach about twenty. After the meeting, many poor peasant members automatically went to different groups to make connections. The middle peasant member Jia Fugui originally did not plan to stay in the cooperative because he saw the chaotic production in the cooperative and was afraid that his income would be reduced. Duan Chaoxuan, a member of the Communist Youth League, carefully calculated the accounts for him and specifically explained the advantages and disadvantages of staying in the cooperative and withdrawing from the cooperative. Not only did he straighten out his own thinking, but he also took the initiative to help mobilize and persuade another middle peasant household. After such in-depth publicity and connections, all except twenty-four cooperative members still wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, and the remaining nineteen voluntarily stayed in the cooperative. The cooperative then earnestly handled the production materials and land processing of the withdrawing farmers fairly and reasonably in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit. The well-to-do middle peasant Li Jianlin had been dissatisfied with the cooperative since he was forced to join the cooperative by the district cadres last fall. This time, when he withdrew from the cooperative, the cooperative returned all his livestock and farm tools, and fairly and reasonably handled the livestock feed and manure, seeds, and other issues that he had invested in the cooperative. He was deeply moved and immediately expressed that he would participate in the mutual aid team after withdrawing from the cooperative and do a good job in production. Many other withdrawing farmers also felt that the agricultural cooperative now handled things in a truly reasonable manner, and not only did they not resent the agricultural cooperative, but they also said: Let's see in the fall, if the agricultural cooperative is really successful, we will definitely participate again.
    After consolidating the agricultural production cooperative by earnestly implementing the principle of voluntariness, the production inside and outside the cooperative has completely changed. In the past, the cooperative cadres called from door to door every morning, and only more than twenty people went to the fields every day; after the consolidation, although there were fewer members, at least thirty members participated in the cooperative labor every day. The day after the consolidation ended, all five pairs of livestock in the cooperative went to the fields and plowed ten mu of land in one day, which was almost half more than the thirteen pairs of livestock that plowed in one day in the past. Many members said: Now that I don't have that dirty feeling in my heart, I have more energy to work! On that day, the poor peasant member Sun Zhentang, an old man, dug the sweet potato mounds in one day equal to what three people dug in one day in the past. Many farmers are connecting and brewing to establish mutual aid teams. The farmers in the surrounding villages are talking about it: Look, the collapsing cooperative in Shangwa Village has really been helped up, and it has also brought along the production of the whole village!
    The consolidation process of the Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shangwa Village fully illustrates that the view that putting the earnest publicity and implementation of the principle of voluntariness in the agricultural cooperation movement in opposition to the consolidation of the Party's socialist position in the countryside is completely wrong. To consolidate the socialist position in the countryside, we must resolutely implement the principle of voluntariness, meticulously conduct education on the socialist future and specific policies of agricultural cooperation, consolidate the thinking of the members who voluntarily join the cooperative, strengthen the members who are not very firm, and allow those farmers who are still unwilling to stay in the cooperative after persuasion and education and implementation of the principle of mutual benefit to withdraw from the cooperative freely.

### 整顿农业生产合作社必须贯彻自愿原则

整顿农业生产合作社必须贯彻自愿原则
    阚枫
    在当前整顿巩固农业生产合作社的工作中，有不少农村干部害怕向群众宣传农业合作化运动中的自愿原则。最近，我在河南省鲁山县曾经不止一次地听到一些这样的情况：有的干部被派去整顿有很多社员要求出社的农业生产合作社，到社以后，不是首先宣传自愿原则，而是首先开会宣布：根据社章规定，出社入社都必须在年终分红结算季节；现在，任何人都不许出社。接着，便领导社员“查一心，找原因”，分析批判出社思想，给要求出社的社员扣上一个“资本主义”的“帽子”。
    为什么这样害怕宣传自愿原则呢？因为这些干部错误地认为：在当前社内一部分社员思想情绪不稳定的情况下，如果贯彻了自愿原则，允许农民自由出社，就会群起退社，使农业合作化运动受到挫折。因此，要想使农业生产合作社巩固起来，就得采用一种强制的办法，把所有已经入社了的农民全都“捆”在社里，“堵住这个缺口”。
    事实上怎么样呢？凡是采取这种办法整顿农业生产合作社的，结果都失败了。有不少社，当负责整社的干部还在那里的时候，也曾一度出现了“热火朝天”进行生产的假象；但是，一当整社干部离开了那里，真象便显露出来了：原来要求出社的社员，仍然吵闹着出社；本来不想出社的社员也埋怨说：这社永远都难搞好！干部来了，光给扣大帽子，不帮助咱解决具体问题，倒不如干脆早些散伙利落！
    实际上，认真贯彻自愿原则，不只不会削弱现有农村中的社会主义阵地，而且还会更进一步地提高广大社外农民的生产积极性和互助合作积极性，为农业合作化运动的发展创造有利条件。鲁山县上洼村和平农业生产合作社，从几乎垮台到巩固起来的经过，就是一个很好的例证。
    这个社在去年秋季建立时，领导建社的区干部不只没有深入地进行思想发动，并且还对一部分当时坚决不愿入社的中农和富裕中农使用了强迫手段。他对中农段福顺当面威吓说：“现在全国各地都在建社，你要不入社，影响咱村的社建不起来，那你可要负责任！”富裕中农李建祥看见不入社不行了，便向区干部说：自己情愿入社，就是有一百元的旧债没法还。区干部当场便答应：“入社以后，由社里给你一百元。”这个社建成以后，生产长期没有走上轨道，社内问题没有及时得到解决，有些本来不是强迫进来的社员害怕自己将来收入减少，也不愿留在社内了。从去年秋天建社以后到今年春耕开始半年多的时间里，就先后闹了三次群起要求出社的风潮。过去，每次发生风波，当地中共区委会都曾派干部前去领导进行整顿；但每次被派去的干部压根就没有宣传和贯彻自愿原则，都怕那样一来会把社搞垮了。因此，社里的问题一直拖延着没有解决。这次，中共鲁山县委派县委副书记王松根前去指导整顿这个社。王松根到社以后，分析了这个社不巩固的原因，主要是没有贯彻自愿原则。因此，应该允许那些经过教育仍然不愿留在社里的农民出社。他首先召开了贫农社员座谈会，细致地进行了社会主义前途和农业生产合作社优越性的教育。本来有些一心一意要想把社办好的贫农社员，看见社里的问题长期不能解决，心里都凉了半截；经过这次教育，都又提高了思想觉悟，表示决心要把社办好。在这次会上，他认真分析了全社社员的思想情况，发现全社原有的四十三户社员中，至少有十四户坚决愿意留在社里；如果工作做好了，还能争取达到二十户左右。会后，许多贫农社员自动分头进行串连。中农社员贾富贵过去因为看到社里生产混乱，害怕自己收入减低，本来不打算留在社里了。青年团员段朝选帮他仔细算了细账，向他具体讲明了留社和退社的利害。他不但自己思想弄通了，并且还主动地去帮助动员说服了另一户中农。经过这样深入地宣传和串连，全社除二十四户社员仍然愿意出社以外，其余十九户都自愿留在社里。社里随即认真按照互利原则，公平合理地处理了出社农民的生产资料和土地加工等问题。富裕中农李建林，自从去秋被区干部强迫入社以后，一直对社不满。这次出社时，社里原物退还了他的全部牲口和农具，并且公平合理地处理了他投到社里的牲畜饲料和粪肥、种籽等问题，他深深地感动了，当场表示出社以后一定要参加互助组，好好地搞生产。别的很多出社的农民也都觉得现在农业社办事确实是合情合理，不但不怀恨农业社，并且说：秋后看，要是农业社真的搞好了，一定再参加。
    这样认真贯彻自愿原则整顿了农业生产合作社以后，社内社外的生产全变样了。过去，每天早上社干部挨门喊叫，每天下地不过二十多人；整社以后，虽然社员少了，每天参加社内劳动的社员最少也有三十人。整社结束以后的第二天，全社五犋牲口下地，一天就犁了十亩地，比过去一天十三犋牲口下地犁的多了差不多一半。有很多社员都说：现在心里不生那肮脏气了，干活也格外有劲啦！就在那天，贫农社员孙振堂老汉一天扒的红薯堌堆等于过去三个人一天扒的。很多农民都在串连酝酿成立互助组。周围村庄的农民纷纷议论说：看，上洼村的这个垮台社硬帮起来了，把全村的生产也都带好了！
    上洼村和平农业生产合作社的整顿经过，充分说明了把认真宣传和贯彻农业合作化运动中的自愿原则，同巩固党在农村中的社会主义阵地二者对立起来的看法，是完全错误的。要巩固农村中的社会主义阵地，就必须坚决地贯彻自愿原则，细致地进行社会主义前途教育和农业合作化的具体政策教育，使自愿入社的社员的思想巩固起来，使不很坚定的社员坚定起来，让那些经过说服教育、贯彻了互利原则以后仍然不愿留在社里的农民自由出社。
