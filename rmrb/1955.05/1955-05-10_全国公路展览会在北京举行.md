National Highway Exhibition Held in Beijing

　　The National Highway Exhibition opened on May 4th at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.

　　The exhibition is divided into four parts: basic construction, maintenance, transportation, and automobile repair, displaying more than 1,000 exhibits. It vividly illustrates the achievements of China's highway construction and highway transportation in the past five years. For example, a large map in the basic construction exhibits shows that before liberation, China's highway lines were sparse, especially in the remote western regions where there were almost no highways. However, in 1954, the mileage of highways open to traffic had increased by nearly double compared to the early days of liberation, and new highways also appeared in the remote western regions.

　　The exhibition showcases the heroic spirit and powerful strength of highway builders who overcome all difficulties in building the motherland, through photos and models of the construction of the Kangzang (Sichuan-Tibet), Qingzang (Qinghai-Tibet) highways, and highways in South China. In the Erlang Mountain model, people can see the overlapping mountains, 3,200 meters above sea level, with the highway winding through the mountainous area for a total of 60 kilometers. On the Nujiang River model, small electric lights indicate the exploration hero Cui Ximing risking his life to explore the road to the construction site on the steep stone cliffs on the west bank. There are also many photos illustrating how road-building heroes fought against wind and snow, wind and sand, quicksand, and scorching heat, to cut through mountains and build roads.

　　The exhibition introduces more than 300 advanced experiences of the Chinese working class in highway construction and highway transportation. These include the Tan Fuju group's graded road surface assembly line method, which increased work efficiency by 125%; Chen Rongcai's experience of safe driving for more than 200,000 kilometers without major repairs; and the steel cable transportation lines, underwater lighting, and lifting frames collectively created by engineer Zheng Lianjian and other technicians and workers.

　　The exhibition's models and photos also demonstrate the achievements of highway builders in inheriting the architectural heritage of bridges and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The exhibition also showcased some models of Soviet mechanical road construction and mechanical road maintenance.

　　全国公路展览会在北京举行
    全国公路展览会五月四日在北京天坛开幕。
    展览会分基本建设、养护、运输、汽车修理四部分，展出展品一千多件。它生动地说明了五年来我国公路建设和公路运输的成就。如在基本建设展品中的一幅大地图，即表明解放前我国的公路线很稀，特别是西部边远地区几乎还没有公路，而一九五四年公路通车里程已较解放初期增加了将近一倍，西部的边远地区也出现了新的公路。
    展览会通过修建康藏、青藏公路及华南地区公路的照片和模型，展示了公路建设者不避任何艰难困苦，建设祖国的英雄气概和强大力量。在二郎山模型中，人们看到群山叠叠，拔海三千二百公尺，公路在山区中蜿蜒盘旋，共达六十公里。怒江的模型上，用一盏盏小电灯表明探险英雄崔锡明在西岸壁陡的石崖上，冒着生命危险探寻进入工地的道路。另有许多照片说明筑路英雄在和风雪、风沙、流沙、酷热搏斗，开山劈岭，修成公路。
    展览会介绍了中国工人阶级在公路建设和公路运输上的三百多种先进经验。有提高工效百分之一百二十五的谭福巨小组级配路面流水作业法；有陈荣材安全无大修行驶二十多万公里的经验；有工程师郑练简和其他技术人员、工人集体创造的钢缆运输线、水下照明灯、升运架，等等。
    展览会的模型和照片还表明了公路建设者在继承祖国桥梁建筑遗产和学习苏联先进经验中所获得的成就。展览会并展出了一部分苏联机械筑路和机械养路的模型。
