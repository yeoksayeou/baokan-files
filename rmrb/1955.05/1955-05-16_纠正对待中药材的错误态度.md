Correcting Erroneous Attitudes Towards Chinese Medicinal Materials
　　Jin Wu
　　Commercial and cooperative departments in various regions currently do not pay enough attention to the management of Chinese medicinal materials. Certain varieties of Chinese medicinal materials often experience tight supplies and stockouts. Many Chinese medicine practitioners in both urban and rural areas face difficulties in formulating prescriptions and incomplete ingredient availability.
　　Some say that this phenomenon is due to the rising material and cultural living standards of the broad masses of people, with increasing attention to health, leading to a significant increase in the demand for Chinese medicinal materials, and that the development of production cannot keep up with the growth in demand. This is only one aspect of the problem. A more important reason is that some cadres do not attach importance to the management of Chinese medicinal materials.
　　Some state-owned commercial and cooperative cadres have adopted an erroneous attitude towards the acquisition of Chinese medicinal materials, one of "buying if they feel like it, not buying if they don't." Among the 487 commonly used plant-based medicinal materials, 392 are wild. Farmers are generally accustomed to using their spare time to collect medicinal materials, and the quantities are relatively scattered. However, in some areas, state-owned commercial departments or cooperatives believe that buying three or five *jin* at a time is too troublesome and refuse to do so. Farmers have paid the price of labor and traveled a long way to collect the medicinal materials, only to be sent back by some cadres with the word "no." As a result, some farmers angrily throw the collected medicinal materials in the fields, vowing never to collect or dig for medicinal materials again. Some medicinal material purchasing departments adopt a "three no's" policy: they don't buy small quantities, they don't buy what they don't understand, and they don't buy what is troublesome. Or: no money, no buying; no understanding, no buying; even if they have money and understand, they still don't buy if they have other tasks. They completely disregard the damage to the production enthusiasm of medicinal material farmers, nor do they consider that they themselves are responsible for supplying the market.
　　In some areas, district and township cadres adopt erroneous and suppressive attitudes towards medicinal material farmers, believing that growing medicinal materials is a "spontaneous force" and "taking the capitalist road." In Henan Province, a major *shengdi* (a type of Chinese medicine) producing area, some cadres threatened medicinal material farmers, saying, "If you grow *shengdi*, the state will not supply you with grain." As a result, the *shengdi* planting area in the area in 1954 was reduced by 58% compared to 1953. The thinking of these district and township cadres is that they are afraid that growing medicinal materials will affect grain production. They do not understand that while growing grain is important, it is equally important to produce medicinal materials with the necessary cultivated land within the scope of the national plan.
　　There are also state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in some Chinese medicinal material producing areas that only emphasize that their own province or locality has enough, and do not actively support the marketing areas throughout the country, resulting in tight supplies or stockouts in many areas.
　　In many areas, the state's price policy is not implemented, purchase and sales prices and regional price differences are unreasonable, and even the price in the producing area is higher than in the marketing area, creating opportunities for some speculative merchants to hoard and speculate, driving up market prices.
　　The current chaotic phenomena in the Chinese medicinal material market must be quickly and effectively improved to ensure normal market supply. The key to changing the chaotic state of the Chinese medicine market lies in the cadres who manage Chinese medicinal materials recognizing the close relationship between Chinese medicinal materials and the broad masses of people, and establishing a viewpoint of serving to promote people's health. Only in this way can we correctly treat the production, collection, purchase and supply of Chinese medicinal materials.

　　纠正对待中药材的错误态度
　　靳吾
    各地商业和合作社部门目前对中药材的经营没有重视。中药材的某些品种常常发生供应紧张和脱销的情况。不少城市和农村的中医都存在着配方困难和配不齐全的现象。
    有人说，这种现象是由于广大人民物质生活和文化生活水平日益增长，人们对健康日益重视，中药材的需要大大增加，生产的发展赶不上需要的增长的结果。这仅仅是问题的一方面。更重要的原因是某些干部对经营中药材没有重视。
    某些国营商业和合作社干部对中药材的收购采取了爱收就收、不爱收就不收的错误态度。在通常需用的四百八十七种植物类药材之中，野生的有三百九十二种，农民一般习惯是利用农闲时间采挖药材，数量是比较零星的。但有的地区国营商业部门或合作社，认为三斤、五斤地收购太麻烦，不肯收。农民付出了劳动代价，跑了不少路，把药材采回来，竟被某些干部以“不收”二字打发回来了。因而有些农民忿然地把采挖的药材扔在田野，发誓再不去采药挖药了。有些药材收购部门是“三不收”：数量少了不收，不懂得的不收，麻烦的不收。或者是：无钱不收，不懂不收；既有钱、也懂得，但有其他任务也不收。他们完全没有考虑对药农生产积极性的损伤，也没有考虑他们自己还担负着供应市场的任务。
    也有的地区的区乡干部对药农种药采取错误的打击态度，认为种药就是“自发势力”，“走资本主义道路”。河南省生地（一种中药）产区有的干部威胁药农说：“种生地，国家不供给粮食”。因而当地一九五四年生地种植面积就比一九五三年缩小了百分之五十八。这些区、乡干部的想法是怕种了药材就影响了粮食。他们不了解：种粮食固然是重要的，但在国家计划范围之内，以必需的耕地生产药材，同样也是重要的。
    还有一些中药材产地的国营商业部门和合作社，他们只强调本省或本地够用就行了，而没有积极支持全国的销区，因而造成许多地区供应紧张或脱销的现象。
    也有不少地区，没有贯彻国家价格政策，购、销价格和地区差价不合理，甚至产地价格比销地还高，因而给一些投机商人造成了囤积居奇、抬高市价的机会。
    目前中药材市场的某些混乱现象必须迅速地切实地得到改善，以保证市场的正常供应。而改变中药市场混乱现象的关键在于经营中药材的干部从思想上认识中药材同广大人民的密切关系，树立为增进人民健康服务的观点。这样，才能正确地对待中药材的生产、采挖、收购和供应工作。
