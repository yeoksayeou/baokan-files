　　On April 25th, the Civil Aviation Administration of China used an airplane to conduct an experiment of extra-root fertilization of wheat on fifty mu of wheat fields at the state-owned Lutai Mechanical Farm, where the wheat was in the jointing and booting stage. After the airplane was filled with "superphosphate" fertilizer solution and took off into the sky, it circled and evenly sprayed the fertilizer solution from the sprayer onto the wheat ridges.

　  芦台机械农场试用飞机施肥
    四月二十五日，中国民用航空局用飞机在国营芦台机械农场的五十亩正在拔节孕穗的麦田里，做了小麦根外施肥试验。当飞机灌足“过磷酸钙”肥水起飞在天空以后，就循环地把肥水从喷射器里均匀地喷撒在麦垅里。　（新华社）
