Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 4th. The thirty-eight representatives of the Delegation of the National Assembly of Vietnam in South Vietnam issued a statement on the chaotic situation in South Vietnam on the 4th. The statement was signed by Ton Duc Thang, Hoang Van Hoan, Pham Van Bach, and others.

The statement expressed sorrow for the persecution suffered by the people of South Vietnam under the rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and their painful experiences in the chaotic situation in South Vietnam. The statement pointed out that American imperialism interfered in the internal affairs of South Vietnam, supported the dictatorial rule of Ngo Dinh Diem, and created bloody conflicts in South Vietnam, making the already suffering people of South Vietnam even more miserable. Therefore, American imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, are the most dangerous enemies of the Vietnamese people and the people of South Vietnam today.

The statement said, in the name of the Delegation of the National Assembly of Vietnam in South Vietnam, we accuse American imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, of infringing upon the lives, freedom, and property of our compatriots in South Vietnam and seriously violating the Geneva Accords. The statement called on the heroic people of South Vietnam to resolutely fight for the establishment of a government in South Vietnam that respects the Geneva Accords and implements universal suffrage. The statement said that only in this way can the people of South Vietnam escape their current tragic situation.
