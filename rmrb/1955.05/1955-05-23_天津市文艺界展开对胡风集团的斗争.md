Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 21st: Many writers, professors, workers, students, and literary and art workers in Tianjin have continuously published thirty articles in the "Tianjin Daily" on the 20th and 21st, launching a struggle against Hu Feng's anti-Party, counter-revolutionary activities and the Hu Feng Group's stronghold in Tianjin.

　　Li Jiyie, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles, wrote: We demand a thorough investigation into the anti-Party behavior of the Hu Feng Group, and eliminate the unhealthy tendencies in the people's literary and art cause. We advise the literary and art workers who have mistakenly fallen into Hu Feng's anti-Party trap to wake up, thoroughly expose Hu Feng, and return to the ranks of the people's literature and art!

　　Writer Fang Ji wrote: Chen Yimen (A Long), dispatched by Hu Feng and invited by Lu Li and Lu Dian, came to Tianjin in 1950 and extensively and systematically promoted the reactionary ideas of the Hu Feng Group. The notorious "life is everywhere," "technique is politics," etc., were advocated by A Long, and his followers promoted them, targeting the call made by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China at that time for writers to delve into the lives of workers, reflect on industrial construction, and for literature and art to actively serve politics. Therefore, a counter-current of thought once existed in Tianjin's literary and art circles, causing serious bourgeois artistic thinking among some literary and art cadres, a tendency to deviate from politics, reality, and the masses, which brought significant losses to Tianjin's literary and art work. Fang Ji proposed: Overthrowing Hu Feng's stronghold in Tianjin, thoroughly defeating the Hu Feng anti-Party group, and eliminating their influence in Tianjin is the urgent combat task of the current Tianjin literary and art circles.

　　Writer Sun Li wrote: We cannot underestimate the adverse influence of the Hu Feng anti-Party group in Tianjin. After the dissemination and promotion by Hu Feng's elements, many of Hu Feng's ulterior motives in literary and artistic viewpoints once found a market in Tianjin. Their sinful influence not only hindered literary and artistic creation, but also injected toxins into some people, making them extremely bored and shameless in their lives and styles, causing very bad influence in society and tarnishing the reputation of the literary and art circles.

　　Engineers Yu Keji and worker Cao Zhenwu also published articles.

　　天津市文艺界展开对胡风集团的斗争
    据新华社天津二十一日电　天津市的许多作家、教授、工人、学生和文艺工作者，在二十日和二十一日的“天津日报”上连续发表了三十篇文章，对胡风反党、反革命活动和胡风集团在天津的地堡展开了斗争。
    天津市文学艺术界联合会副主席李霁野写道：我们要求彻底查究胡风集团的反党行为，扫清人民文艺事业中的歪风邪气。我们劝告误入胡风反党圈套的文艺工作者猛醒，彻底揭露胡风，回到人民的文艺队伍来！
    作家方纪写道：由胡风所派遣，由鲁藜、芦甸所邀请，于一九五○年来到天津的陈亦门（阿垅），曾大量的和系统的宣传了胡风集团的反动思想。臭名昭著的“到处是生活”、“技术即政治”等等，便是由于阿垅的倡导，他的追随者们的鼓吹，是针对着当时中共天津市委员会所提出的要作家深入工人生活，反映工业建设，文艺要积极为政治服务的号召而发的。因此，在天津文艺界中，曾经存在一股思想逆流，造成了一些文艺干部中严重的资产阶级艺术思想，脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众的倾向，给天津的文艺工作带来了重大损失。方纪提出：掀掉胡风在天津的地堡，彻底打垮胡风反党集团，肃清他们在天津的影响，是当前天津文艺界的紧急的战斗任务。
    作家孙犁写道：我们不能低估胡风反党集团在天津的恶劣影响，经过胡风分子的传播宣扬，胡风的很多别有用心的文艺论点，曾经在天津找到市场。他们的罪恶影响，不只妨碍了文艺创作，并且在一些人身上注射了毒素，使这些人在生活上和作风上表现得极端无聊和无耻，在社会上造成很坏的影响，败坏了文艺界的名声。
    工程师余克稷和工人曹振武也都发表了文章。
