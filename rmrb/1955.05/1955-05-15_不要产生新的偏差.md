After the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions announced the cancellation of the "technical innovation" slogan, a few factory cadres in Shanghai misunderstood this measure. They mistakenly interpreted the cancellation of the "technical innovation" slogan to mean that they no longer needed to actively lead workers in improving technology, learning technology, or actively leading workers' rationalization proposals. As a result, recently, the number of rationalization proposals from workers in general factories in Shanghai has greatly decreased, and some factories do not treat workers' suggestions that are beneficial to production with enthusiasm. Some engineering and technical personnel at the state-owned Shanghai Electric Motor Factory are even preparing to abolish the organizations that handle employee rationalization proposals.

This situation is clearly abnormal. It also contradicts the original intention of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in canceling the "technical innovation" slogan.

In the past, in technical innovation, we advocated invention and creation in isolation and one-sidedly, neglecting the study of Soviet experience and China's existing experience, which limited the mass character of labor emulation. This approach was incorrect. But this does not mean that the technical reforms and rationalization proposals of the past were all wrong. The fact is that the vast majority of technical reforms and rationalization proposals in the past were very good. They all contributed to improving production and increasing labor productivity to varying degrees. Such suggestions and reforms that are beneficial to production were needed in the past and are still needed in the future. The cancellation of the "technical innovation" slogan is not, and must not, cancel the work of improving technology and rationalization proposals. China's old industrial technology is very backward, and there are many areas that need to be improved, and the main way to improve technology, as in the past, is to rely on the labor and wisdom of millions of people. Paying attention to useful suggestions from the masses and giving them enthusiastic care and active assistance at all times is always the most important responsibility of enterprise leaders.

The purpose of canceling the "technical innovation" slogan is not to weaken labor emulation, but precisely to further promote the healthy development of labor emulation, organize more workers to jointly improve technology, learn and master new technologies, and complete the country's production and construction tasks. This is a positive measure, not a negative one. After correcting the one-sidedness of past technical innovation, we must prevent the emergence of another kind of one-sidedness and ensure that labor emulation is carried out normally.

    不要产生新的偏差
　　施明
    中华全国总工会执行委员会主席团宣布取消技术革新的口号以后，上海市有少数工厂的干部对这个措施发生了一些误解，他们把取消技术革新的口号，错误地理解成今后可以不再积极地领导工人改进技术、学习技术了，可以不再积极地领导工人的合理化建议工作了。因此最近以来，上海一般工厂工人的合理化建议都大大减少，有些工厂对工人提出的一些有益于生产的建议，也不热情相待。国营上海电机厂有些工程技术人员，甚至准备撤销处理职工合理化建议的机构。
    这种情况显然是不正常的。它同全国总工会取消技术革新口号的原意，也是相违背的。
    过去，在技术革新中曾孤立地和片面地倡导创造发明，忽视了学习苏联经验和我国已有的经验，使得劳动竞赛的群众性受到了限制，这种做法是不对的。但这并不是说，过去的那些技术改革和合理化建议都是错误的了。事实是，过去绝大部分的技术改革和合理化建议，都是很好的，它们都不同程度的对改进生产提高劳动生产率起了作用，这种有益于生产的建议和改革，过去需要，以后仍然需要。取消技术革新的口号，决不是，也决不能取消改进技术和合理化建议等工作。我国旧有工业技术很落后，有待改进的地方还很多，而改进技术的主要道路，正如过去一样，只有依靠千百万群众的劳动智慧。重视来自群众的有益的建议，随时给予热情的关怀和积极的帮助，永远是企业领导人最重要的职责。
    取消技术革新的口号，目的不是为了削弱劳动竞赛，而正是为了使劳动竞赛进一步健康地开展起来，组织更多的工人群众来共同提高技术，改进技术，学习并掌握新技术，完成国家的生产和建设任务。这是一个积极的措施，而不是一个消极的措施。我们在纠正了过去技术革新中的片面性以后，必须防止另外一种片面性的产生，保证劳动竞赛得到正常的开展。
