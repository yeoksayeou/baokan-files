Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    China Livestock Company Northwest Regional Company Takes Steps to Eliminate Errors and Accidents During Transportation
    Letter from China Livestock Company Northwest Regional Company: The article "Unclaimed Goods" published on the "Readers' Letters" page on January 30th is a completely correct criticism of us. In order to correct this error and reduce and eliminate errors and accidents in cargo transportation, we sent the head of the storage and transportation department to Tianjin and Beijing for investigation and held three meetings for inspection, studying improvement methods.
    Why do we have serious chaos in the work of transferring goods? This is mainly because we do not pay enough attention to storage and transportation work, lack strict systems in our work, so that after errors occur, we do not conduct timely inspections, and we condone the irresponsible attitude of some staff towards state property. In storage and transportation work, although we have also established some systems, we have not seriously implemented them, so errors occur constantly. This is worthy of our deep self-criticism. In order to correct errors and improve work, we have established a storage and transportation work inspection team and discussed the past errors among all employees in the storage and transportation department. At the same time, we have rationally organized the labor force, clarified the scope of work on the basis of the existing division of labor, strengthened the responsibility system, and actively eliminated errors and accidents.
　　
    Self-Criticism of Exploration Team 205
    Letter from Exploration Team 205 of the North China Geological Bureau: The People's Daily criticized our team under the title "Field Exploration Teams Should Also Pay Attention to Protecting State Property." There are indeed varying degrees of lack of care for state property at the sites of various rigs under our team. Especially in November and December of last year, after some drilling rigs were moved to new locations for installation, some materials and equipment left at the original rig sites were not processed in time, causing some damage to state property. After discovering the above problems, we immediately organized an inspection team to go to the sites of various rigs for inspection and processing, and established necessary systems such as material storage and material issuance. However, after strict inspection, some situations of not cherishing state property still exist, which should arouse our attention and continue to be inspected and corrected.
　　
    It is Impossible to Run a Pig Farm Well if You are Separated from the Masses
    Letter from Jinhua Pig Farm, a local state-owned enterprise in Zhejiang Province: The criticism from farmers in Zhucun and other places published in the People's Daily on March 20th against the Jinhua Pig Farm being separated from the masses is a great education for all our employees.
    Since the establishment of the Jinhua Pig Farm, we have not established good contact with the surrounding masses, have not publicized our production measures and various systems to the surrounding masses, and have not played the due demonstration role; and our attitude has not been good enough when dealing with the masses. These are all specific manifestations of our lack of mass perspective and separation from the masses. In the past, we saw that there was a surplus in production and that the sales of piglets were also very good, so we developed complacency. If it were not for the serious criticism from the masses this time, we would not be able to wake up, and perhaps even greater mistakes would occur in the future. Now, we realize that it is impossible to run a pig farm well if we are separated from the masses.
    In the process of inspection and handling, in addition to conducting inspections and criticisms from top to bottom and from within the Party to outside the Party to unify ideological understanding, we also invited thirty-eight farmer representatives from Qinghu, Qiubin, and Chengnan Townships to conduct a forum. At the meeting, we made a self-criticism to the farmer representatives; after the meeting, we organized the farmer representatives to visit.
    In the future, we plan to make the following improvements: (1) Regularly publicize to the surrounding farmers the benefits of developing the pig raising industry for agricultural production, publicize the significance of livestock epidemic prevention and various measures to improve feeding management, and hold regular production technology seminars to exchange experiences. (2) Help several agricultural production cooperatives near the pig farm develop the pig raising industry as much as possible. The price of piglets can be given a 10% discount. (3) Without affecting the work of our farm, organized visits can be allowed; our farm will assign people to help explain and promote pig production technology to the visiting masses.
　　
    Inspect the Blind Greed and Bias in Welfare Work
    Letter from the Hunan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China: The criticism of our bank's construction of sanatoriums by Yao Yongchu, a reader of the People's Daily on March 27th, is correct. After our inspection, the construction of the sanatorium does not conform to the policy of focusing on recuperation, supplemented by treatment, and gradual expansion. The number of beds and medical equipment have not been gradually added according to the actual situation, so the utilization rate is very low.
    The root cause of the above problems is that we do not have enough understanding of the policy of "gradually improving the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of developing production." We did not well implement the spirit of thrift when carrying out welfare undertakings, and there was a phenomenon of subjectivism and blind greed. In addition to improving the management of the sanatorium and saving expenses, we are determined to learn from this lesson and inspect and improve our entire welfare work.
　　
    Baha District Also Has "Collective Housing"
    Letter from the Baha District Committee of the Communist Party of China, Xishui County, Hubei Province: The People's Daily editorial's criticism of collective housing has sounded the alarm for us: We must not act based on subjective wishes.
    In December 1954, the members of the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative made more than 10,000 adobe bricks, preparing to replace the old adobe bricks for fertilizer. The director of the cooperative, Bai Dingyin, and the deputy director, Xiao Kaigui, saw this situation and promoted the benefits of collective housing, proposing that everyone use the new bricks to build a collective house. At that time, some cadres in the cooperative disagreed with building this kind of house. Xiao Kaigui criticized them for being "selfish," "ideologically backward," and "not seeing the socialist future," and said that building a collective house would increase socialist factors, and with a collective house, the agricultural cooperative would be more consolidated. Under this "reasoning," no one dared to raise any objections.
    This house is built on a hill on the road from Luotian County to Baha, with a meeting room, a storage room, an accounting room, and a warehouse that can store 200,000 jin of grain. The construction of the house cost a total of 700 yuan, and there is still a deficit of more than 200 yuan. Because of the deficit, people are constantly coming to ask for money and arguing about debts, cadres are blaming each other, affecting production investment and the mood of the members. Currently, there are 17 households in the members who are short of food. These are all serious consequences caused by collective housing.
    The mistake of the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in building collective housing is inseparable from the bureaucracy of the district committee. District Chief Zhang Jiefei stayed in this cooperative for a month, neither stopping the blind actions of the township cadres nor reporting to the district committee. When the district committee learned about this, the collective house had already been built. This shows that our bureaucracy is serious. We are determined to remember this lesson, improve our work style, and do a good job in the Party's work.
　　
    Precise Machine Tools Have Been Properly Protected
    Letter from Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory: The People's Daily readers' criticism of our factory for not protecting precise machine tools well is completely correct. Because we have not studied enough, we are not very familiar with the internal structure, precision, and performance utilization of this machine tool. The maintenance of the machine tool is very poor, and there is no special care. Later, Soviet experts asked us to maintain it well, which aroused our attention. We have set up a separate machine room in the fourth quarter of 1954, equipped with winter and summer temperature balancing equipment and manual lifting equipment, and organized workers to study at the same time.

专栏：批评建议的反应

　　批评建议的反应
　　中国畜产公司西北区公司设法消除运输中的差错事故
    中国畜产公司西北区公司来信：一月三十日“读者来信专页”上发表的“无人认领的货物”一文对我们的批评是完全正确的。为了纠正这一错误，减少和消灭货物运输中的差错事故，我们曾派储运部门负责人到天津和北京进行调查，并召开了三次会议进行检查，研究了改进办法。
    为什么我们在调运货物的工作中存在着严重的混乱现象呢？这主要是我们对储运工作重视不够，工作中缺乏严格的制度，以致在发生错误以后没有及时地进行检查，纵容了某些工作人员对国家财产不负责任的错误态度。在储运工作上，我们虽然也建立了一些制度，但是因为没有认真执行，所以不断发生错误，这是值得我们深刻检讨的。为了纠正错误改进工作，我们已经成立了储运工作检查小组，并把过去的错误事实，在储运部门全体职工中进行了讨论，同时，合理的组织了劳动力，在现有分工的基础上，明确划分工作范围，加强负责制，积极消灭差错事故。
　　二○五勘探队的检讨
    华北地质局二○五勘探队来信：人民日报曾以“野外勘探队也要注意爱护国家财产”为题，对我队提出批评。我队所属各机台现场确实存在着不同程度的不爱护国家财产的现象，特别是去年十一、二月，由于有些钻机迁移到新的地址安装后，在原机台现场上所遗留下的部分物资器材未能及时处理，使国家财产遭受到一定的损失。我们发现上述问题后，即组织检查组，分赴各机台现场进行检查和处理，并建立了器材保管和材料领发等必要的制度。但严格检查起来，某些不爱护国家财产的情况还仍然存在着，这是应该引起我们注意和继续检查纠正的。
　　脱离群众是办不好猪场的
    浙江省地方国营金华猪场来信：三月二十日人民日报登载朱村等地农民批评脱离群众的金华猪场，对我们全场职工是个很大的教育。
    金华猪场成立以来，我们没有很好的同周围群众建立联系，没有把我场的生产措施和各种制度向周围群众进行宣传，没有起到应有的示范作用；而且在和群众发生关系时态度又不够好，这都是我们缺乏群众观念、脱离群众的具体表现。过去我们看到生产有盈余，小猪的销路也很好，就滋长了自满情绪，如果不是这次群众对我们提出了严正的批评，我们还不能清醒过来，将来可能发生更大的错误。现在，我们认识到脱离群众是办不好猪场的。
    我们在检查处理的过程中，除了由上到下、由党内到党外进行了检查、批判、统一了思想认识以外，还邀请了清湖、秋滨、城南乡的三十八个农民代表进行座谈。会上，向农民代表作了检讨；会后，又组织农民代表进行了参观。
    今后，我们准备作这样一些改进：（一）经常向周围农民宣传发展养猪事业对农业生产的好处，宣传家畜防疫的意义和各种改进饲养管理的措施，并定期召开生产技术座谈会，互相交流经验。（二）尽可能帮助猪场附近的几个农业生产合作社发展养猪事业，小猪的价格可以九折优待。（三）在不影响我场工作的原则下，可以允许有组织地进行参观；对参观的群众，我场将抽出人来帮助讲解，结合推广毛猪生产技术。
　　检查福利工作中盲目贪大偏向
    中国人民银行湖南省分行来信：三月二十七日人民日报读者姚永初对本行修建休养所的批评是正确的。经我们检查，休养所的建筑不符合以休养为主、治疗为辅、逐步扩大的方针，病床和医疗设备也没有根据实际情况逐步添置，因而利用率很低。
    产生上述问题的根本原因是由于我们对“在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民的物质文化水平”这一方针认识不够，在举办福利事业时没有很好贯彻节约精神，而存在着主观主义、盲目贪大的现象。我们除了要改进休养所的管理工作，节约开支外，并决心吸取这个教训，检查和改进我们整个福利工作。
　　巴河区也有“集体房屋”
    中共湖北省浠水县巴河区委会来信：人民日报社论对集体房屋的批评，给我们敲起了警钟：不能凭主观愿望办事。
    一九五四年十二月，光明农业社的社员做了一万多块土砖，准备把老的土砖换下来做肥料。社长白定银和副社长萧开桂看到这种情形就宣传集体房屋的好处，提议大家利用新砖造一座集体房屋。当时，社内有些干部不同意造这种房子，萧开桂就批评他们“自私自利”、“思想落后”、“看不到社会主义前途”，并说造了集体房屋就是增加社会主义因素，有了集体房屋，农业社就更加巩固了。在这番“理由”压抑下谁也不敢提意见了。
    这座房子建筑在由罗田县通往巴河大路的一个山岗上，内有会议室、保管室、会计室、还有一座仓库可以存放粮食二十万斤。房子建成功一共花了七百元，现在还亏空二百多元。因为有了亏空，讨钱吵债的不离门，干部之间互相埋怨，影响了生产的投资，也影响了社员的情绪。现在社员中缺口粮的共十七户。这都是集体房屋造成的严重恶果。
    光明农业社建筑集体房屋的错误，是和区委会的官僚主义分不开的。区长张戒非在这个社住了一个月，既没有制止乡干部的盲目行动，也没有向区委汇报；当区委知道这件事的时候，集体房屋已经建成了。这说明我们的官僚主义是严重的，我们决心记取这个教训，改进工作作风，做好党的工作。
　　对精密机床已妥为保护
    沈阳第二机床厂来信：人民日报读者对我厂没有保护好精密机床提出批评，是完全正确的。由于我们学习不够，对这台机床的内部结构，精密程度和性能利用等都不很熟悉。对机床的维护保养很差，更没有特殊的照顾。后来，苏联专家要我们很好维护，这才引起我们的重视。我们已于一九五四年第四季度设置了单独的机房，室内设置了冬、夏季的衡温设备和手动起重设备，同时组织工人进行了学习。
