Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 14th: On the morning of May 9th, at 10:00 AM, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched over 400 armed police to heavily surround the Chinese Aviation Corporation's warehouse (formerly known as Bailey Shipyard) on Ma Tau Wai Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong. They forcibly stormed into the premises, using violence to coerce all Chinese Aviation Corporation employees who were steadfastly protecting state property to leave their posts. Our employees immediately declared that this was the state property of the People's Republic of China and refused their unreasonable demands. The British police then assaulted our employees, injuring four of them. At 2:00 PM that day, the employees of the Chinese Aviation Corporation reiterated to the British police in charge: "The Chinese Aviation Corporation's warehouse and its associated assets are the property of the Chinese Aviation Corporation and a part of the property of the People's Republic of China left in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government should respect and protect the sacred ownership of the state property of the People's Republic of China. Now, it is dispatching a large number of armed personnel to force our employees to leave. We hereby lodge a serious protest." And declared that "the Hong Kong government should be fully responsible for this incident and all its consequences." All employees were then forced to leave the aforementioned warehouse. It is reported that the Hong Kong British authorities have subsequently handed over the warehouse and its associated assets to the Siber Hegner & Co., instigated by the American imperialist element Claire Chennault, for "takeover."

It is learned that the American imperialist element Claire Chennault has long plotted to seize the property of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and the Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) in Hong Kong. In July and October 1952, Chennault, in collusion with Siber Hegner & Co. manager William L. White, seized 71 aircraft and their associated assets belonging to the CNAC and CATC in Hong Kong. This time, Siber Hegner & Co. fabricated a so-called "property rights dispute" and filed a lawsuit in the Hong Kong High Court, attempting to seize ownership of the aforementioned warehouse belonging to the Chinese Aviation Corporation. However, the fact is that the Chinese Aviation Corporation not only holds legitimate evidence for the aforementioned warehouse but also has no so-called "property rights dispute" with any party. The property of the Chinese Aviation Corporation in Hong Kong is all state property of the People's Republic of China. As early as December 3, 1949, Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that no one may infringe, damage, or move this property by any means. Therefore, when Siber Hegner & Co. filed a lawsuit in the Hong Kong High Court based on the fabricated so-called "property rights dispute," the Chinese Aviation Corporation sent a letter to the Hong Kong government solemnly declaring that this property was state property of the People's Republic of China, demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities immediately take measures to stop this act of infringing upon our state property. However, the Hong Kong British authorities disregarded the solemn declaration of the Chinese Aviation Corporation and, on April 12, illegally ruled that the aforementioned warehouse belonged to Siber Hegner & Co. and, on May 9, dispatched a large number of armed police to invade the aforementioned warehouse, beat and expel our employees, to assist the American imperialist element Claire Chennault in implementing the seizure conspiracy. Such an illegal and barbaric act cannot but arouse the indignation of the Chinese people.

　　香港英国当局出动武装警察
　　非法劫夺我中国航空公司在港财产
    新华社广州十四日电　五月九日上午十时，香港英国当局出动武装警察四百余人将属于我中国航空公司在香港九龙马头围道的中国航空公司仓库
  （原名庇利船厂）重重包围，并强行冲入院内，用武力威迫我中国航空公司坚守岗位保护国家财产的全体员工退出。我方员工当即声明这是中华人民共和国国家财产，拒绝其无理要求。英方警察竟向我员工行凶殴打，致使我员工四人受伤。当日下午二时，我中国航空公司员工再次向英国警察负责人员声明：“中国航空公司仓库房屋及其附属资财是中国航空公司的产业，是中华人民共和国留在香港财产的一部分，香港政府对于中华人民共和国国家财产的神圣产权应该尊重和保护，现在竟出动大批武装人员强迫我方员工退出。对此，特提出严重抗议。”并声明“香港政府应对此次事件以及由此引起的一切后果负完全责任”，全体员工然后被迫离开上述仓库。据悉，香港英国当局随后已将该项仓库房屋及其附属资财交给受美帝国主义分子陈纳德指使的美商西伯勒公司“接管”。
    查美帝国主义分子陈纳德企图劫夺我中国航空公司和中央航空公司在香港财产，蓄谋已久。一九五二年七月及十月，陈纳德即曾伙同西伯勒公司经理白乃能劫夺了我中国航空公司和中央航空公司在香港的七十一架飞机及其附属资财。此次该西伯勒公司又捏造所谓“产权纠纷”，向香港高等法院提出诉讼，企图劫夺属于中国航空公司所有的上述仓库房屋的所有权。但事实上我中国航空公司对于上述仓库房屋，不仅持有合法证据，且与任何方面均无所谓“产权纠纷”，我中国航空公司在香港财产均为中华人民共和国国家财产，早在一九四九年十二月三日周恩来总理即曾指出，此项财产任何人不得以任何手段侵犯、破坏、移动。因此，当西伯勒公司以捏造的所谓“产权纠纷”在香港高等法院提出诉讼时，我中国航空公司即曾致函香港政府严正声明此项财产为中华人民共和国国家财产，要求香港英国当局立即采取措施，停止此种侵犯我国家财产的行为。但香港英国当局不顾中国航空公司的严正声明，竟于四月十二日将上述仓库房屋非法判归西伯勒公司所有，并于五月九日出动大批武装警察侵占上述仓库房屋，殴打和驱逐我员工，以协助美帝国主义分子陈纳德实施劫夺阴谋。这种非法的、蛮横的行为，不能不引起中国人民的愤慨。
