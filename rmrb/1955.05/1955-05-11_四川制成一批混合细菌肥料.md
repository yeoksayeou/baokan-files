Sichuan Province has successfully produced 20,000 bags of mixed bacterial fertilizer in the laboratory of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry. Starting from April 15th, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has transported them to various counties in the Wenjiang and Leshan regions for trial use by state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and farmers. This batch of mixed bacterial fertilizer is expected to fertilize 150,000 mu of land.

Mixed bacterial fertilizer is a new type of fertilizer containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria, phosphorus bacteria, and silicate bacteria. These bacteria can transform nutrients from the air, soil, and phosphate rock powder that crops cannot absorb into absorbable nutrients, which can increase crop yields. In 1953, the North China Agricultural Science Institute in our country inoculated cotton with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, resulting in a 13.1% increase in pre-frost flowers. In 1954, the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Science Institute used rhizobia (bacterial fertilizer) to coat peanut seeds, resulting in an increase of 20 jin of peanuts per mu.

The trial production of bacterial fertilizer was proposed by Guan Xuanmin, director of the laboratory of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry. When she proposed a method to improve the effectiveness of phosphate fertilizer with phosphorus bacteria, she immediately received the consent and support of the Provincial Department of Industry. She began experimenting with phosphorus bacteria in January of this year, and the results proved that phosphorus bacteria can rapidly convert phosphorus elements in phosphate rock powder that crops cannot absorb into absorbable phosphate fertilizer, improving the effectiveness of phosphate rock powder. This experimental work has received extensive assistance from the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Science Institute and the North China Agricultural Science Institute, enabling the rapid production of 20,000 bags of mixed bacterial fertilizer.

### 四川制成一批混合细菌肥料

　　四川制成一批混合细菌肥料
    四川省工业厅化验室试制成功的两万袋混合细菌肥料，从四月十五日起已由省供销合作社运往温江、乐山专区各县供国营农场、农业生产合作社和农民试用。这批混合细菌肥料，预计可肥田十五万亩。
    混合细菌肥料是一种新式肥料，含有固氮菌、磷细菌、矽酸盐细菌。这些细菌能把空气、土壤和磷矿粉中对农作物不能吸收的养分，分别变成能吸收的养分，可提高农作物产量。一九五三年我国华北农业科学研究所，用固氮菌接种棉花，结果霜前花增产了百分之十三点一。一九五四年四川省农业科学研究所用根瘤菌（细菌肥料）拌种花生，每亩花生增产二十斤。
    试制细菌肥料是由四川省工业厅化验室主任官选民提出的。当她提出用磷细菌提高磷肥效力的办法后，立即得到省工业厅的同意和支持。她从今年一月开始作磷细菌的试验，结果证明磷细菌能把农作物不能在磷矿粉中吸收的磷素，迅速变成能吸收的磷肥，提高磷矿粉的效力。这项试验工作曾得到四川省农业科学研究所、华北农业科学研究所的多方帮助，使两万袋混合细菌肥料能迅速制成。
