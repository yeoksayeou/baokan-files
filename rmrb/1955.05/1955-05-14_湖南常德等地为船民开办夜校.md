　  Hunan's Changde, Yiyang, Xinhua, Hongjiang, Shaoyang, and twenty other ports have successively established night schools for boat people.

    Based on the mobility and dispersion of boat people, boat people's night schools have adopted the "three-stage teaching method on water." When boat people stay in port, they participate in night school studies. When they leave the port, teachers assign exercises, and small teachers are selected within the transportation team to lead the review. After returning to the port, the small teachers report to the teachers, and the teachers conduct inspections. The boat people's enthusiasm for learning is getting higher and higher. Some boat people get up at dawn, recognize a few new characters, and then set sail. Zhao Yunxiang and Deng Yuxiao, boat people from Hengyang, learn new characters during navigation. They were unsure of the pronunciation of two characters and asked the teacher as soon as they returned to port.

    This kind of boat people's night school helps boat people improve their culture. Among the seventy-nine students in Hengyang, 70 percent can recognize all 1,500 characters in the textbook, and 90 percent can master the rules of writing.

    There are more than 160,000 boat people in Hunan. Opening schools for boat people is something that has never happened in the lives of boat people. At present, the Hunan Provincial Inland Waterway Navigation Administration is running a night school teacher training class, preparing to assign another group of teachers to teaching positions.

### 湖南常德等地为船民开办夜校

　  湖南常德等地为船民开办夜校
    湖南常德、益阳、新化、洪江、邵阳等二十三个港口先后为船民开办了船民夜校。
    船民夜校，根据船民的流动性和分散性，采取了“水上三段教学法”。船民在港口停住时，参加夜校学习，离港出发时，由教师布置习题，在运输小组内选出小先生领导复习，回港后由小先生向教师汇报，教师进行检查。船民们学习的情绪越来越高，有的船民，天才亮就起床，认几个生字再开船。衡阳船民赵云相和船工邓玉孝在航行中学生字，有两个字搞不清读音，一回港来就问教师。
    这种船民夜校，帮助船民提高了文化。衡阳七十九个学员中，有百分之七十能全部认识课本上的一千五百个生字，百分之九十能掌握写字的规律。
    湖南有船民十六万多人，为船民开办学校，是船民生活中有史以来所未有过的事情。目前，湖南省内河航运管理局正在开办夜校教师讲习会，准备再分派一批教师去担任教学工作。
