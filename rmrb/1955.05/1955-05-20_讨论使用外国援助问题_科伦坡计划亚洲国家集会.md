Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 14th: A meeting of Asian countries under the Colombo Plan's Consultative Committee was held in Simla, India from the 9th to the 13th. Representatives from Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, South Vietnam, Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo, and Sarawak participated in the meeting.

The communique issued after the meeting stated that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the use of foreign aid, particularly US aid, on a regional basis.

It is known that in the foreign aid plan for the next fiscal year submitted to Congress on April 20th, US President Eisenhower stipulated the allocation of $200 million as a special fund to assist Asian countries. When US Foreign Operations Administration Director Stassen visited South Asian countries in late February and early March this year, he asked these countries to submit opinions on the US aid plan. Stassen advocated providing aid to Asia on a regional basis.

The meeting's communique shows that the countries participating in the meeting refused to establish an organization similar to the European Economic Cooperation Administration, which is controlled by the United States, to arrange aid on a regional basis. The communique stated that the general opinion was that setting up an intermediate regional organization would not be beneficial, and that aid plans should continue to take the form of bilateral arrangements as much as possible. The communique shows that the countries participating in the meeting did not accept the suggestion of allowing European countries to participate in the Colombo Plan. The communique said, "The general opinion is that if any European country wishes to help the economic development of the countries in this region, it can do so on a bilateral basis. The meeting believes that the time has not yet come to establish a permanent secretariat for the Colombo Plan."

An Associated Press dispatch from Simla said that Stassen's plan had apparently "suffered a severe blow" due to the Simla meeting's disapproval of using US aid on a regional basis. The report also said that Stassen's plan to have European countries participate in the Colombo Plan "did not arouse much enthusiasm."

According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from London on the 13th, London officials believe that the Simla meeting's opinion on handling US aid to Asia on a bilateral basis "fully conforms to British expectations." The report said that Britain opposes the establishment of a regional organization similar to the European Economic Cooperation Administration because it may compete with the Colombo Plan organization, which is already an open secret.

### 讨论使用外国援助问题　科伦坡计划亚洲国家集会

　　讨论使用外国援助问题
  　科伦坡计划亚洲国家集会
    新华社新德里十四日电　科伦坡计划咨询委员会亚洲国家会议九日到十三日在印度的西姆拉举行。参加会议的有柬埔寨、印度、印度尼西亚、日本、老挝、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、泰国、南越、马来亚、新加坡、北婆罗洲和沙捞越的代表。
    会议结束后发表的公报说，召开这次会议的目的是讨论在区域性的基础上使用外国援助，特别是美国援助的问题。
    人们知道美国总统艾森豪威尔在今年四月二十日向国会提出的下一财政年度的援外计划中，规定要拨付二亿美元作为援助亚洲国家的特别基金。美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生在今年二月下旬和三月上旬访问南亚各国时，曾要这些国家提出对美国援助计划的意见。史塔生主张在区域性的基础上对亚洲提供援助。
    会议的公报表明，参加会议的国家拒绝成立类似欧洲经济合作局的为美国控制的组织来在区域性的基础上安排援助。会议公报说，一般的意见是，设立中间的区域性组织没有好处，援助的计划尽可能继续采取双边的形式。公报表明，参加会议的国家没有接受让欧洲国家参加科伦坡计划的建议。公报说，“一般的意见是，任何欧洲国家如果希望帮助这个区域的国家的经济发展的话，它可以在一个双边的基础上这样做。会议认为设立一个科伦坡计划的常设秘书处的时候还没有来到。”
    美联社发自西姆拉的消息说，史塔生的计划显然已由于西姆拉会议不赞成在区域性的基础上使用美国援助的决定而“受到了猛烈的打击”。消息并说，史塔生的使欧洲国家参加科伦坡计划的方案
  “也没有引起什么热情”。
    据法新社伦敦十三日电，伦敦官方人士认为西姆拉会议关于在双边基础上处理美国对亚洲援助的意见“完全符合于英国的期望”。消息说，英国反对设立一个同欧洲经济合作局类似的区域性组织，因为它可能同科伦坡计划组织相对抗，这已经是一个公开的秘密。
