　　Our working people, who are advancing bravely on the road of socialism, are today warmly celebrating the 1955 International Labor Day.
    In the past year, China's glorious working class launched a nationwide labor competition, completed the state construction plans for the whole year of 1954 and the first quarter of 1955, and made many new achievements in China's great socialist construction cause. Many new factories unprecedented in China's history have been or are being established. Thousands of new products that China could not manufacture in the past are now beginning to be manufactured by ourselves. The productivity of the entire society is developing rapidly under the brave labor of the working class. Its speed is unprecedented and impossible in China's history. According to preliminary calculations, the proportion of modern industry in China's total industrial and agricultural output value in 1954 has risen to about 33 percent. The total output value of industrial production increased by about 15 percent compared with 1953. The output value of state-owned industry (including local state-owned industry) increased by more than 20 percent compared with 1953.
    In 1954, the broad masses of Chinese peasants overcame the largest flood in nearly a century with amazing perseverance, worked hard to increase the production of grain and industrial raw materials, actively supported the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, cotton and oil, and strongly supported the country's industrial construction. The number of agricultural production cooperatives has increased about six times in the past year, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounts for about 13 percent of the total number of peasant households in the country. Together with mutual aid teams, the number of organized peasant households has reached about 60 percent of the total number of peasant households in the country.
    The achievements of Chinese workers and peasants on the production front in the past year, and the continuous consolidation and development of the worker-peasant alliance, are of extremely important significance to China's struggle to build socialism, strengthen national defense, and liberate Taiwan. It has also strengthened the strength of people all over the world in their struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.
    1955 is a decisive year for China's first five-year plan. The total output value of industry and agriculture this year will increase by about 7 percent compared with 1954; the state's investment in capital construction will increase by about 30 percent compared with 1954. The tasks of all departments of the national economy will be more arduous than in 1954. The completion of these tasks will further enhance China's socialist economic strength and national defense strength. The Chinese working people must further develop their enthusiasm and creativity for labor, develop the heroic spirit of being masters of the country, overcome all difficulties, and strive to fully complete and overfulfill the various targets of the national plan.
    All employees of state-owned enterprises and joint state-private enterprises should launch labor competitions on a larger scale and in a more in-depth manner, discover the potential in industry through labor competitions, make full use of all available technical equipment, learn and master new technologies, continuously improve labor productivity, increase the quantity of products and ensure their quality, and continuously reduce production costs, and strive to exceed the targets of the national plan.
    The manufacture of new products occupies an important position in China's industrialization. In 1954 and the first quarter of this year, China has successfully trial-produced 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators, ore sintering machines, various Soviet-style precision machine tools, automatic electrical measuring instruments for oil exploration, automatic block signals for railways, and many other new products in heavy and light industries. This is clear evidence of the infinite wisdom and creativity of the Chinese working class. However, there are still many shortcomings in the work of trial-producing new products, and it is far from meeting the needs of the national economy. All relevant departments must cooperate sincerely, overcome difficulties, actively produce and use these new products as much as possible.
  In labor competitions, we should not only actively encourage inventions and creations and various new rationalization proposals, but also conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and actively promote China's existing effective advanced experience based on specific circumstances and production needs. We must correct the tendency to only pay attention to inventions and creations and ignore the learning and promotion of the results of inventions and creations, or to start and not finish in learning and promotion work.
  In all departments of the national economy and all state organs, practical methods must be formulated to implement comprehensive and strict economy in order to accelerate socialist accumulation. Unreasonable and serious waste in equipment utilization, labor organization, raw material consumption, and administrative expense expenditures must be overcome with all efforts. The serious waste in all aspects of capital construction such as planning, surveying, designing, and construction, as well as the formalism errors in general civil buildings, must be resolutely corrected. In order to reduce administrative expenses, state organs must streamline their structures and save expenses. People throughout the country, especially organs, schools, troops, and enterprises, must pay special attention to saving food consumption. The comprehensive economy movement must be made a regular movement of millions of people. Economy is the fundamental method of socialist accumulation, and it has particularly special and significant significance in the initial stage of construction in our country.
    China's construction cause is developing in a planned way. The construction projects, the scale and speed of construction, and the distribution of construction must be planned. Therefore, the use and allocation of labor must also be planned. With the progress of the national plan, many economic departments and labor occupations that were not valued in the past have become supremely glorious fronts, and many areas that were considered remote and backward in the past have become construction centers that are changing with each passing day. The Chinese working people, intellectuals, and state organ staff should actively respond to the call of the motherland, resolutely obey the government's allocation, and go to all needed posts to work hard to create our beautiful future.
    In order to improve workers' enthusiasm for production and construction, it is necessary to continuously strengthen and improve trade union work. Trade unions bear a huge organizational responsibility in consolidating labor discipline, improving the technical level of employees, and correctly leading labor competitions. In order to complete their tasks, trade union organizations at all levels and in all industries must improve the internal democratic system and democratic life, closely connect with the masses, strengthen criticism and supervision from below, and earnestly care for the material and cultural life of the employees, and help the employees solve various problems that can be solved in life.
    In order to support socialist construction and improve their own lives, the peasant masses should work hard to increase the production of grain, cotton, and various industrial raw materials in various ways in accordance with the national plan. Rural workers and all peasants should unite and implement the government's policy of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales of grain, improve the shortcomings and errors in the unified grain sales work, and adhere to the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives. This is the urgent task of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and improving the peasants' enthusiasm for production at present.
    The transportation industry and commerce are important links in the development of industrial and agricultural production. Transportation workers should work hard to accelerate the turnover of vehicles and ships, improve transportation capacity and transportation quality, and reduce transportation costs. Commercial staff should continuously improve procurement and supply work, ensure the supply of raw materials for industrial production and the supply of various agricultural production materials, ensure the supply of food and daily necessities for urban and rural people, and continuously improve the operation and management of commerce and reduce the circulation costs of goods.
    All patriotic industrialists and businessmen should respond to the call of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, earnestly accept the management of state administrative organs and the leadership of the state-owned economy, accept the supervision of the working masses, love the country and abide by the law, strive to operate enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, strive to do a good job in the business entrusted by the state, and actively accept socialist transformation and embark on the path of state capitalism and state planning. The masses of employees in private enterprises should unite with capitalists, work together, reform the operation and management of enterprises, improve product quality, and supervise capitalists to strictly implement the state's policies and laws, so as to gradually complete the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation under the unified plan and unified arrangement of the state.
    Socialist society will bring unlimited happiness and a happy life to the Chinese people, but every step forward in socialism must be realized by the Chinese people themselves with heroic creative labor. The Chinese working people have endless construction potential. Party and state organs and all people's organizations must use all methods to improve their work, mobilize and organize the potential of the people, and give it full play in the cause of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. As long as we can mobilize and organize the potential of the broad masses of the people, we will be able to overcome all difficulties on the road forward and make the socialist cause advance rapidly.
    People of all classes, strata, nationalities, parties, and other patriotic people across the country, unite under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China, and use our heroic labor to build a socialist society!
    The socialist construction cause of the Chinese people is not carried out in isolation. Our construction has received great assistance from the countries of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and our victory also assists the peace cause of the world. As we celebrate this year's "May Day" International Labor Day, the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp has become even stronger. The cause of the people of Asian and African countries in opposing colonialism, safeguarding world peace, and promoting friendly cooperation has been further developed through the Asian-African Conference. However, international aggressive forces are still using various conspiracies in an attempt to obstruct the peace cause of the Asian people and the people of the world, and are actively preparing to launch a new war. The Chinese people must continue to strengthen China's national defense strength unremittingly and strive for the liberation of Taiwan. The Chinese people must unite closely with the peace and democracy camp, with all peace-loving countries and people in Asia, Africa, and the world, and jointly strive to ease international tensions, ban weapons of mass destruction, universally reduce armaments, oppose war, and maintain lasting peace in Asia and the world.

### 用我们的英勇劳动来建设社会主义社会

　　用我们的英勇劳动来建设社会主义社会
    正在社会主义道路上奋勇前进的我国劳动人民，今天热烈地庆祝一九五五年的国际劳动节。
    我国光荣的工人阶级在过去一年中展开了全国范围的劳动竞赛，完成了一九五四年全年和一九五五年第一季度的国家建设计划，使我国伟大的社会主义建设事业取得了许多新的成就。我国历史上从来没有过的许多新工厂已经或正在建立起来。过去我国不能制造的千百种新的产品，现在正开始自己制造。整个社会的生产力，正在工人阶级的奋勇劳动下迅速地发展，它的速度是我国历史上所没有的，也是不能有的。根据初步计算，一九五四年我国现代工业在工农业总产值中所占的比重，已经上升到百分之三十三左右。工业生产的总产值比一九五三年增长了百分之十五左右。国营工业（包括地方国营工业）的产值比一九五三年增长了百分之二十以上。
    我国广大的农民群众，在一九五四年以惊人的毅力战胜了近百年来最大的洪水，努力增产了粮食和工业原料，积极支持了粮食、棉花和油类的统购统销政策，有力地支援了国家的工业建设。农业生产合作社在过去一年中发展到六倍左右，入社农户约占全国农户总数百分之十三。连上互助组，组织起来的农户已经达到全国农户总数百分之六十左右。
    我国工人和农民过去一年中在生产战线上的成就，工农联盟的不断巩固和发展，对于我国建设社会主义和加强国防力量、解放台湾的斗争，都有极其重要的意义。它也加强了全世界人民为和平民主和社会主义而斗争的力量。
    一九五五年是我国第一个五年计划具有决定意义的一年。这一年的工农业总产值又将比一九五四年增长百分之七左右；国家的基本建设投资约比一九五四年增加了百分之三十左右。国民经济各部门的任务都将比一九五四年更为繁重。这些任务的完成将进一步增强我国社会主义的经济力量和国防力量。我国劳动人民必须更加发扬劳动的积极性和创造性，发扬国家主人翁的英雄气概，克服一切困难，为全面完成和超额完成国家计划的各项指标而努力奋斗。
    一切国营企业和公私合营企业的职工，应该以更大的规模，更加深入地开展劳动竞赛，通过劳动竞赛来发掘工业中的潜力，充分地利用一切可能利用的技术设备，学习和掌握新技术，不断地提高劳动生产率，提高产品的数量并保证它们的质量，不断地降低生产成本，争取超过国家计划的指标。
    新产品的制造在我国工业化的事业中占着重要的位置。我国在一九五四年和今年第一季度已经试制成功六千瓩汽轮发电机，矿砂烧结机，各种苏联型式的精密工作母机，勘探石油用的自动电测仪，铁路上用的自动闭塞信号，其他重工业和轻工业方面的许多新产品，这是我国工人阶级具有无穷智慧和创造能力的明证。但是试制新产品的工作还有许多缺点，它还远不能满足国民经济的需要。各有关部门必须通力合作，克服困难，积极生产并且尽量使用这些新产品。
  在劳动竞赛中，我们不仅应当积极鼓励发明创造和各种新的合理化建议，并且应当根据具体情况和生产需要，认真学习苏联的先进经验，积极推广我国已有的行之有效的先进经验。必须纠正那种仅仅注意发明创造而忽视学习和推广发明创造的成果，或者在学习和推广工作上有始无终的倾向。
  在国民经济的一切部门以及一切国家机关，都必须订出切实的办法来实行全面的和严格的节约，以加速社会主义的积累。在设备利用、劳动组织、原材料消耗、管理费用支出等各方面的不合理和严重浪费现象，必须用一切努力来加以克服。在基本建设的计划、勘察、设计、施工等各方面的严重浪费现象，以及一般民用建筑中形式主义的错误，必须坚决纠正。为了节减行政费用，国家机关必须精简机构，节约开支。全国人民，首先是机关、学校、部队和企业，必须特别注意节约粮食的消费。要使全面的节约运动成为千百万群众的经常性的运动。节约是社会主义积累的根本方法，它在我国建设初期的情况下尤其具有特殊重大的意义。
    我国的建设事业是有计划地发展的，建设的项目、建设的规模和速度、建设的分布必须有计划，因此劳动力的使用和配置也必须有计划。随着国家计划的进展，许多过去不被重视的经济部门和劳动职业成为无上光荣的战线了，许多过去被认为偏僻落后的地区成为日新月异的建设重镇了。我国劳动人民、知识分子和国家机关工作人员应当积极响应祖国的号召，坚决服从政府的调配，到一切需要的岗位去为创造我们美好的将来而努力。
    为了提高工人的生产和建设热情，必须不断地加强和改善工会工作。工会在巩固劳动纪律、提高职工技术水平、正确地领导劳动竞赛方面担负着巨大的组织责任。为了完成自己的任务，各级各业工会的组织必须健全内部的民主制度和民主生活，密切联系群众，加强自下而上的批评和监督，并且切实地关怀职工群众的物质生活和文化生活，帮助职工群众解决生活中各种可能解决的问题。
    为了支援社会主义建设和改善自己的生活，农民群众应当按照国家计划，努力用各种办法增产粮食、棉花和各种工业原料。农村工作人员和全体农民应当团结一致，贯彻政府对于粮食的定产、定购、定销政策，改善粮食统销工作中的缺点和错误，并且坚持根据自愿和互利的原则来巩固农业生产合作社。这是目前巩固工农联盟、提高农民生产积极性的迫切任务。
    运输业和商业是发展工农业生产的重要环节。运输业工作人员要努力加速车辆和船舶的周转，提高运输能力和运输质量，降低运输成本。商业工作人员要不断地改进收购和供应工作，保证工业生产上的原料供应和各种农业生产资料的供应，保证城乡人民食粮和生活必需品的供应，不断地改善商业的经营管理，减低商品的流转费用。
    一切爱国的工商业家们应当响应中国人民政协的号召，切实接受国家行政机关的管理和国营经济的领导，接受工人群众的监督，爱国守法，努力经营有利于国计民生的企业，努力做好国家委托的业务，积极接受社会主义改造，走上国家资本主义和国家计划的轨道。私营企业中的职工群众应当团结资本家，共同努力，改革企业的经营管理，提高产品质量，并且监督资本家严格执行国家的政策法令，以便在国家的统一计划和统一安排之下，逐步完成社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业。
    社会主义社会将给我国人民带来无限幸福和美满的生活，但社会主义的每一步前进是要我国人民自己用英雄式的创造性劳动来实现的。我国劳动人民具有无穷无尽的建设潜力。党和国家机关和所有的人民团体，必须用一切方法来改善自己的工作，发动和组织人民群众的潜力，使它发挥到社会主义工业化的和社会主义改造事业上去。只要我们能够把广大人民群众的潜力发动和组织起来，我们就能够战胜前进道路上的一切困难，使社会主义事业迅速前进。
    全国各阶级、各阶层、各民族、各党派和其他爱国的人民，团结在中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的领导下，用我们英勇的劳动来建设社会主义社会！
    我国人民的社会主义建设事业不是孤立地进行的。我们的建设得到以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国的巨大援助，我们的胜利也援助着全世界的和平事业。当我们庆祝今年“五一”国际劳动节的时候，全世界和平民主阵营的力量更加壮大了。亚非各国人民反对殖民主义、维护世界和平、增进友好合作的事业，经过亚非会议获得了进一步的发展。但是国际侵略势力还在用各种阴谋，企图阻挠亚洲人民和全世界人民的和平事业，积极准备发动新的战争。我国人民必须坚持不懈地继续增强我国的国防力量，为台湾的解放而努力。我国人民必须同和平民主阵营、同亚洲、非洲和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民紧密地团结起来，共同为缓和国际紧张局势、禁止大规模毁灭性武器、普遍裁减军备、反对战争、维护亚洲和世界的持久和平而斗争。
