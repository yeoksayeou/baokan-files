Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 5th: The Indian "Tribune" published on May 3rd an interview with Major General Thapa, head of the Nepalese delegation to the Asian-African Conference. In the interview, Thapa commented on the Asian-African Conference, saying, "The most important fact is the overwhelming sense of Asian-African solidarity everywhere. This sense of solidarity is so strong that even those who oppose justice and follow the other side ultimately have to agree because they do not want to go against the trend."

Regarding the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Thapa said, "As long as the spirit exists, it does not matter how many principles are announced, five, ten, or twenty are all possible."

Referring to military blocs such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Middle East Defense Organization, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Thapa said: "We hope to stay out of these military alliances." He said that these military alliances would not help us.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, May 6th: Burmese Minister of Defense U Ba Swe, in a speech at a rally commemorating "May Day" International Labor Day on May 1st, called for efforts to realize the ten principles proposed by the Asian-African Conference to promote world peace and cooperation. U Ba Swe said: After discussing the issues of opposing colonialism, striving for world peace, and conducting economic cooperation, the Asian-African Conference adopted these ten principles. If these principles can be sincerely accepted and applied by all countries in the world, a third world war can be avoided.

U Ba Swe also said: "Burma's attitude towards international issues is:
  (1) Do not participate in any bloc and oppose bloc organizations; (2) Cooperate with those who oppose war and love peace to prevent a third world war and strive for peace; (3) Peaceful coexistence with all countries in the world; (4) Oppose aggression and do our best to support the independence cause of countries that have been invaded; (5) Strive to get more countries to oppose war and strive for lasting peace."

　　尼泊尔出席亚非会议代表团团长和缅甸国防部长
　　评论亚非会议的意义和成就
    新华社新德里五日电　印度“论坛报”五月三日刊载尼泊尔出席亚非会议代表团团长塔帕少将最近接见“论坛报”记者时就亚非会议发表的谈话说，“最重要的事实是到处洋溢着亚非团结感。这种团结感是这样强烈，连那些反对公理并且跟着另外一方跑的人最后都不能不同意，因为他们不想违背潮流。”
    塔帕谈到和平共处的五项原则时说，“只要精神存在，宣布多少项原则是无关紧要的，五项，十项，二十项都可以。”
    塔帕谈到像东南亚条约组织、中东防务组织以及北大西洋公约组织之类的军事集团时说：“我们方面希望置身于这些军事联盟之外。”他说，这些军事联盟决不能帮助我们。
    新华社六日讯　仰光消息：缅甸国防部长吴巴瑞五月一日在纪念“五一”国际劳动节的一个大会上发表演说，呼吁为实现亚非会议提出的促进世界和平和合作的十项原则而努力。吴巴瑞说：亚非会议就反对殖民主义、争取世界和平和进行经济合作的问题进行了讨论以后，通过了这十项原则。这些原则如果能为世界各国诚恳地加以接受和运用，就可以避免第三次世界大战。
    吴巴瑞又说：“缅甸对国际问题的态度是：
  （一）不参加任何集团，反对集团组织；（二）和反对战争、爱好和平的人合作，制止第三次大战，争取和平；（三）同世界各国和平共处；（四）反对侵略，尽力支持被侵略国家的独立事业；（五）努力争取更多的国家来反对战争，争取持久和平。”
