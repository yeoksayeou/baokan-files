    Trade Team on Ximeng Mountain
    In the area where Ximeng Mountain in Yunnan connects with the interior of the motherland, there are mountains and steep ridges everywhere, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. It takes about half a month to transport supplies from Pu'er to Ximeng Mountain by pack animals. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the people of all ethnic groups living here often could not get enough salt. At that time, the price of salt in the market was not fixed. Usually, a "keng" of grain (equivalent to six "dou" or 78 old "jin") could only be exchanged for four "jin" of salt, and thirty old "jin" of ginger could only be exchanged for four "liang" of salt. In the market of Manbolong, there were even cases where thirty-six "jin" of rice were exchanged for one "jin" of salt.
    Since December 1952, when the trade team of the Lancang Lahu Autonomous Region Trading Company of Yunnan Province was established in Ximeng Mountain, the production and lives of the Kawa, Lahu, and other fraternal ethnic groups living in the Ximeng Mountain area have changed. The people of all ethnic groups on the southwestern border, who had rarely eaten salt for many years, can now eat salt regularly. The local specialties that had been piled up in the mountainous areas for many years have been transported out with the help of the trade team's purchasing.
    Ximeng Mountain is a place rich in resources. There, there are abundant mineral deposits, abundant rice, soybeans, buckwheat, sesame, perilla, saltpeter, fat pigs, and yellow fruits with yellow color and sweet juice. There, almost every household has several yellow fruit trees. Every winter, the amount of yellow fruit on the market from more than a dozen villages near Ximeng alone is about 40,000 "jin."
    When spring came, the trade team carried salt, printed cloth, matches, and other supplies to Nanxia Village. In just one day, the fraternal ethnic groups in the village took out more than 12,000 "jin" of rice in exchange for a large amount of salt and printed cloth. When the girls put the brightly colored printed cloth on their shoulders, the surrounding masses were happy for their happiness. The elderly grandmothers said with envy, "When we were young, it was difficult to even wear rags! You are wearing floral clothes this year, how happy you are! We must produce more to repay the kindness of Chairman Mao!" The next day, when the comrades of the trade team were preparing to load their pack animals to return to Ximeng Mountain, the people of Nanxia Village enthusiastically picked bright cockscomb flowers and inserted them into the comrades' small pockets. They supported the old and led the young, sending them off for more than four "li" before stopping, standing on the high ground and waving goodbye.
    With the increasing growth of production, the task of the Ximeng Mountain trade team has become more arduous. In 1954, they transported 203,100 "jin" of salt, 297 bolts of cotton and printed cloth, 297 pieces of homespun cloth, and more than 33,300 boxes of matches. However, they were not satisfied with their past achievements and unanimously expressed that they would work harder in the future to ensure the successful completion of purchasing and supply work, to promote the development of agricultural production and gradually improve the living standards of all ethnic groups, so as to make the beautiful border area even more beautiful.

### 西盟山上的贸易小组

    西盟山上的贸易小组
    在云南西盟山与祖国内地相连的地方，到处是重山峻岭，交通极为不便。从普洱用牲口驮运物资到西盟山，需要半个月左右的时间。在国民党反动统治时期，居住在这里的各族人民经常吃不到盐巴，那时候，市场上的盐巴没有一定的价格，通常一坑谷（合六斗重七十八老斤）只能换四斤盐，三十老斤的生姜，只能换到四两盐巴；在曼勃龙街子上曾有三十六斤稻谷换一斤盐巴的。
    自从一九五二年十二月间，云南省澜沧拉祜族自治区贸易公司在西盟山头成立了贸易小组的那一天起，住在西盟山区的佧瓦族、拉祜族等兄弟民族生产和生活就发生了变化。许多年来很少吃到盐的西南边界各族人民，现在能够经常吃到盐了。多少年堆在山区的土特产品，靠着贸易小组的收购运送出去了。
    西盟山是一个物产丰富的地方。那里，有丰富的矿藏，有丰盛的稻谷、黄豆、荞麦、芝麻，有苏子、火硝、肥猪，还有色黄汁甜的黄果。那里，差不多每户都有几棵黄果树，每年冬季，仅西盟附近十几个寨子的黄果上市量就有四万斤左右。
    春天来了，贸易小组驮了盐、花布、火柴等物资到南霞寨子去，仅仅一天的时间，寨子上的兄弟民族拿出一万二千多斤稻谷，换回了大量的盐巴和花布。当姑娘们把色彩鲜艳的花布披上自己的肩膀的时候，周围群众为着她们的幸福而高兴。年老的大娘们用羡慕的口气说道：“我们在年轻的时候，连破片也难穿上啊！今年你们穿上了花衣服，多幸福啊，我们要多多生产来报答毛主席的恩德啊！”第二天贸易小组的同志们正在准备驮子回西盟山的时候，南霞寨子的群众热情地摘了鲜艳的鸡冠花，插在同志们的小口袋上。他们扶老携幼送了又送，一直送了四里多路才停了下来，站在高处挥手送别。
    在生产日益增长的情况下，西盟山贸易小组的任务更加繁重了。一九五四年，他们驮运了二十万三千一百多斤盐，二百九十七匹棉布和花布，二百九十七件土布，三万三千三百多盒火柴。但是，他们并没有满足以往的成绩，一致表示今后要加倍努力，保证做好收购供应工作，来促进农业生产的发展和逐步提高各族人民的生活水平，使美丽的边疆更加美丽。　　　官容
