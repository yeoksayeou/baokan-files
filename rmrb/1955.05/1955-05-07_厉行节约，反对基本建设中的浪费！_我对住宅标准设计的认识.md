Vigorously Practice Economy and Oppose Waste in Capital Construction!

My Understanding of Standard Housing Design

Li Chunling, Architect, Standard Design Office, Beijing Industrial Architectural Design Institute

Since the country began large-scale economic construction, the task of capital construction has become increasingly heavy. For a long time, there has been a situation in capital construction where design cannot keep up with construction, and construction cannot keep up with the demands of the task. To change this situation, the construction industry must break away from the handicraft production method and embark on the path of industrialization. To this end, we must first start with the work of design standardization, and on the basis of design standardization, promote material prefabrication and construction mechanization.

Our country currently has the conditions for a certain degree of mechanized construction, and it is possible to achieve design standardization. However, some designers emphasize that current conditions are poor, and they insist on waiting until the entire building industry is industrialized before discussing design standardization, or they believe that standard designs are too "simple," have no "knowledge," and will hinder design creativity, etc. They do not understand that standard design is a comprehensive achievement of design, materials, and construction, and it serves to promote material prefabrication and construction mechanization, and to complete the country's capital construction tasks through design standardization. Therefore, it is a very complex work, containing extensive knowledge, and it also opens up broad creative paths for designers. Waiting for standard design and thinking that standard design hinders creation are both wrong ideas.

Design standardization is a major reform in our country's design work and is a common goal for designers of various professions in design institutions. However, at present, we do not pay enough attention to standard design when carrying out design work, and the existing standard designs also have serious shortcomings. For example, in 1954, the standard design of the 301 housing unit that I designed for the residences of workers and staff in industrial and mining enterprise bases and large cities in North China was not based on thorough investigation and research before the start of the design. Based solely on several Soviet reference books on this subject, I subjectively believed that industrial and mining enterprise bases are cities of a socialist nature, and the design standards for workers' housing should also be socialist standards. Therefore, according to the Soviet design standards, the living area for each person was designed to be nine square meters, with a bathroom, closet, hot water heating, wooden floors or magnesite floors for the living area, and equipment in the kitchen for future use of gas for cooking. It was believed that only such a standard design could be considered "caring for people," and the so-called "rational design" for the future, but "irrational use" for the present was used as a shield. Thus, the Soviet unit plan design was adopted, coupled with a facade with subjective and formalistic appearance, and it was beautifully named a combination of "socialist content plane" and "national form facade." As a result, after preliminary inspection: in terms of floor plan design, it was inconvenient to use due to the narrow opening; the toilet had no light, and lights had to be turned on for daytime use; the end unit did not open windows in the direction suitable for opening windows in order to pursue form. In terms of structural design, it only followed behind the construction, and did nothing to promote the industrialization of construction. In terms of facade design, it was handled too rigidly and old-fashioned, and the decorations were too scattered and messy.

Later, at the beginning of the 302 special design in a certain place, I wanted to improve one step on the basis of the 301 design. Therefore, the floor plan design widened the opening and divided it into several opening widths, thinking that this could always meet the requirements of users. As a result, the variety of openings made the specifications of floor slabs and beams complicated. In terms of structural design, the cast-in-place method was changed to prefabrication of all components. Regardless of the construction conditions, large beams weighing two tons and large prefabricated stairs were used. The components that were used in small quantities were also prefabricated. Finally, it was understood that the construction conditions were not sufficient, and the floor slabs and stairs had to be completely reworked. In terms of facade design, decorations were added as much as possible wherever decorations could be added. False Sumere bases, complicated balconies, window covers, wall decorations, and very wide eaves were used. Dou Gong brackets were also moved up. There were also 65 cm wide wind boards, 2-meter long hanging fish, and tall and heavy ridges and ridge flowers. Even in the preliminary design stage, a double-eaved hip roof was tried.

In the above two housing standard designs, because there was no in-depth understanding of the living requirements and lifestyles of the working people, as well as family population, income burden, and in terms of structural design, there was no deep understanding of the significance of building industrialization, and mastering the realistic conditions and advanced achievements of comprehensive design, construction, and materials in standard design. The standard design of the 301 housing unit followed the construction, and the 302 ran too fast and too far away from the possible construction conditions. In terms of facade treatment, although glazed tile roofs were not built, there were also tendencies of revivalism and formalism. Such a design cannot be called a standard design, because they are divorced from the realistic economic foundation and the requirements of the broad masses of working people.

What are the requirements of the broad masses of working people? Based on our recent visits to understand the existing workers' and cadres' residences, and looking at the living conditions of workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, before liberation, the vast majority of them lived in cave dwellings. After liberation, the workers moved into the old bungalows where the Japanese workers used to live. In 1952, the factory built another batch of row-style bungalows. After the workers moved in, most of them lived in one room per household, about 12 to 15 square meters, with four to seven people. Cooking was done under the eaves, in the living room, or in a kitchen of about 2 square meters. In winter, flower pot stoves were used for heating and cooking. However, due to the continuous development of the factory and the continuous increase in workers, the above-mentioned living conditions can only solve the housing problem for about 60% of the workers, and 40% of the workers urgently need to solve the housing problem. Among them, some live in Changxindian, which is far away from the factory, and some live in the eastern suburbs or outside Qianmen. The round trip every day, plus work and study, takes 14 to 16 hours, so they cannot get adequate rest, which affects their health. Some are married but have no house to live in. Single dormitories are also very crowded. Among them, there are several double-decked general bunk dormitories built in 1951, which are not only noisy but also not ventilated and very unsanitary. In short, the housing shortage is very serious, and the existing living conditions are also very poor. This proves that the most basic requirement of the broad masses of working people for housing is to have a house to live in, and the 301 and 302 housing standard designs I designed are divorced from the realistic economic foundation of the residents, and the funds are spent on impractical aspects.

Recently, we are studying how to improve the existing standard design. We consider that if the bathroom is cancelled and the bathing problem is solved in the overall layout, the cost can be saved by 3%, which is equivalent to saving 2.5 yuan per square meter, and the usable area is increased; if the wooden floor or magnesite floor is changed to a cement floor, the cost can be saved by 2 yuan per square meter; if the closet is cancelled and the living area is expanded, 1.8 yuan per square meter can be saved. In the facade design, if the false decorations are cancelled, only the hanging flower gate, the heavy roof ridge, and the straight roof curvature are changed, the cost can be saved by 1 yuan per square meter. As for heating, it can be temporarily not installed, and there will be no technical difficulties to install it after the country's production and people's living standards are further improved. At present, ordinary families use flower pot stoves, which can be used for both heating and cooking, which is more economical than heating. If we save from the above aspects, we can save 15 yuan per square meter in total; in non-heating areas, we can also save 7 or 8 yuan per square meter. If 12 million square meters of residential buildings can save an average of 10 yuan per square meter, the country can save a total of 120 million yuan. With this money, 1.7 million square meters of workers' housing can be built, which can solve the housing problem for more than 250,000 workers. Housing standard designs like 301 and 302, which do not proceed from the realistic economic conditions of the country and the broad masses of working people, not only waste the country's valuable funds and reduce the construction area of housing, making it impossible for most working people to have houses to live in, but also make the houses that have been built too good and too burdensome, making it impossible for most working people to afford to live in them. Therefore, this standard design cannot meet the needs of the people.

Our experience is that the quality standards of residential buildings must be based on the country's realistic economic conditions and the realistic living requirements of workers, appropriately consider the requirements for development, and gradually improve with the development of the national economy. And in order to do a good job in standard design, architectural designers must deeply understand the lives of the masses, and conduct research, analysis, and then creation. Only in this way can we create housing that truly meets the requirements of the country's general line and enables the broad masses of working people to benefit, and can we fully realize the investment effect.

　　厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！
　　我对住宅标准设计的认识
　　北京工业建筑设计院标准设计室建筑师　李椿龄
    国家开始大规模经济建设以后，基本建设的任务是日益繁重了。在基本建设方面长时期存在着设计赶不上施工，施工赶不上任务要求的情况。想改变这一情况，必须使建筑事业摆脱手工业生产方式，走上工业化的道路。为此，首先要从设计标准化工作着手，并在设计标准化的基础上，促使材料工厂化和施工机械化。
    我国目前已具备了一定程度机械化施工的条件，实现设计标准化是有可能的。但是，有些设计人员强调目前条件差，非要等到建筑全部工业化以后再谈设计标准化问题，或认为标准设计太“简单”，没有什么“学问”，会阻碍设计的创造性等。他们不了解，标准设计是综合设计、材料、施工各方面的最先进的成就，通过设计标准化来促进材料工厂化和施工机械化，并为完成国家基本建设任务而服务的。因此，它是一项非常复杂的工作，包含着广泛的学问和知识，同时也给设计人员开辟了广阔的创作道路。对待标准设计的等待思想和认为标准设计妨碍创作的思想都是错误的。
    设计标准化是我国设计工作中的重大改革，是设计机构中各工种设计人员共同努力的方向。但是，目前我们在进行设计时，对于标准设计还重视不够，而已有的标准设计中，也存在着很严重的缺点。例如：一九五四年，我为华北地区工矿企业基地及大型城市职工居住而设计的三零一住宅的标准设计，在开始设计之前，没有经过周密的调查研究，只是根据几本苏联有关这方面的参考书籍，就主观认为工矿企业基地是社会主义性质的城市，职工住宅的设计标准也应该是社会主义的标准，因此就按照苏联的设计标准，把每一人的居住面积设计为九平方公尺，并有浴室、壁橱、温水暖气，居住地面要用木地板或铺菱苦土，厨房有为将来用煤气烧饭的设备等。认为只有这样的标准设计，才能算得上是“对人的关怀”，并以所谓为了将来“合理设计”目前先“不合理使用”的理由作挡箭牌，于是就采用了苏联的单元平面设计，加上自己主观臆想的形式主义的外表立面，而美其名为“社会主义内容的平面”结合“民族形式的立面”。结果，经初步检查：在平面设计上，由于开间太狭，使用起来不方便；厕所无光线，白天使用要开灯；尽端单元为了追求形式，在适于开窗的方向反而不开窗。在结构设计上，只跟在施工后面跑，对建筑工业化毫不起作用。在立面设计上，则又处理得太呆板陈旧，装饰也分散零乱得很。
    以后，在三零二某地专用设计开始的时候，想在三零一的设计基础上提高一步，于是平面设计将开间放阔并分几种开间阔度，认为这样总能满足使用者的要求了。结果由于开间种类多，造成楼板大梁规格复杂化。在结构设计上，则把现制改为构件全部预制，也不顾施工条件，就采用了二吨重的大梁、大型预制楼梯，把数量用得很少的构件也预制，最后才了解施工条件不够，只得将楼板和楼梯全部返工。在立面设计方面，凡是能装饰的地方就尽量加以装饰，又采用须弥座，复杂的阳台、窗罩、墙花和很阔的挑檐，并把斗拱也搬了上去。还有六十五公分阔的搏风，二公尺长的悬鱼，高而重的屋脊和脊花。甚至在初步设计的时候，还曾试用重檐大歇山屋顶。
    在以上两个住宅标准设计的平面布置方面，由于没有深入了解劳动人民的生活要求和生活方式，以及家庭人口、收入负担；在结构设计方面也没有深刻了解建筑工业化的意义，掌握标准设计中综合设计、施工和材料方面的现实条件和先进成就。三零一住宅的标准设计是跟着施工跑，三零二又脱离了施工的可能条件跑得太快太远。在立面处理方面，虽然没有盖琉璃瓦顶，但同样也有复古主义与形式主义的倾向。像这样的设计是不能称得上是标准设计的，因为他们脱离了现实经济基础和广大劳动人民的要求。
    广大劳动人民的要求是什么呢？以我们最近参观了解很多现有工人及干部住宅，以石景山钢铁厂的工人居住情况来看，他们在解放以前，绝大多数都是住在窑洞里。解放以后，工人才搬到过去日本工人所住的旧平房里。一九五二年，工厂又建了一部分行列式平房。工人搬进去后，大都是每户住一间，约十二到十五平方公尺，住四口人到七口人。烧饭有在檐口底下，有在居室内，也有在二平方公尺上下的厨房内。冬季用花盆炉取暖带烧饭。但是，由于工厂不断发展，工人不断增加，像上例的居住条件只能解决百分之六十左右的工人居住问题，还有百分之四十的工人迫切需要解决住房问题。他们之中有住在离厂很远的长辛店的，也有住东郊或前门外的，每天路途往返加上工作、学习要花费十四小时到十六小时，以致得不到适当的休息，影响了身体的健康；也有的结了婚没有房子住。单身宿舍同样很挤，其中有数幢一九五一年修建的双层统铺宿舍，不但噪杂，而且不通风，很不卫生。总之，缺房问题很严重，现有居住条件也很差。这证明：广大劳动人民对于住宅的最基本要求是有房子住，而我设计的三零一和三零二的住宅标准设计都脱离了居住者的现实经济基础，把资金花费在不切合实际的方面去了。
    最近我们正在研究如何改进现有的标准设计。我们考虑：假如将浴室取消，洗澡问题在总体布置内解决，就可以节约造价百分之三，等于每平方公尺节约造价二元五角，并提高了使用面积；若将木地板或菱苦土地面改为水泥地面，每平方公尺能节约造价两元；要是取消了壁橱扩大居住面积，每平方公尺就能节约一元八角。在立面设计中，如果将虚伪的装饰取消，仅垂花门、沉重的屋脊探海和把屋面翘度改直，每平方公尺造价就能节约一元。至于暖气也可暂不安装，待国家生产和人民生活水平进一步提高后再安也没有什么技术困难。目前一般家庭使用花盆式火炉，又能取暖又能烧饭，比起暖气是较为经济的。从以上几方面来节约的话，每平方公尺共能节约十五元；非取暖地区，每平方公尺也能节约七、八元。假如一千二百万平方公尺的住宅建筑每平方公尺平均节约十元，总共就能给国家节约一亿二千万元。用这些钱，能多修建一百七十万平方公尺的工人住宅，能解决二十五万多工人的居住问题。类似三零一和三零二这种不从国家和广大劳动人民的现实经济条件出发的住宅标准设计，不但浪费了国家可贵的资金，减少了住宅的建筑面积，使得多数劳动人民没有房子住，而已盖成的住宅，又因条件太好，负担太重，使得大多数劳动人民住不起。因此，这种标准设计就不能满足人民的要求。
    我们的体会是：住宅建筑的质量标准必须在国家现实的经济条件和工人现实生活要求的基础上，适当地考虑发展要求，随着国民经济的发展而逐步提高。而要想把标准设计搞好，建筑设计师必须深入了解群众的生活，经过研究、分析，再进行创作。这样才能创造出真正能符合国家总路线要求，使广大劳动人民能得到实惠的住宅，也才能充分发挥投资效果。
