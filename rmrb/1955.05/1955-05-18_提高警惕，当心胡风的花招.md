　　Heighten Vigilance, Beware of Hu Feng's Tricks
    Chen Laizeng
    I am a student at the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School attached to Beijing Normal University. After reading Hu Feng's self-criticism and Shu Wu's exposure of Hu Feng's anti-Party materials, I was extremely angry. His fake self-criticism can no longer deceive anyone. It seems that Hu Feng is pretending to be serious, and his self-criticism is quite plausible, but when compared with the materials exposed by Shu Wu, it is very clear that he is simply an incorrigible liar who is unwilling to tell the truth at all, and wants to use the signboard of "My Self-Criticism" to deceive people. Just as the editor's note of the "People's Daily" said, we cannot allow Hu Feng to continue to deceive readers by using our newspaper. If there were no materials exposed by Shu Wu for comparison, how many of our worker-peasant students and the masses would have been deceived by him again. Now he can no longer deny it, it is no longer the time to deny it! Hu Feng, wake up, stop pretending to be serious. You have been an anti-Party and anti-people person for more than ten years, and you still say things like "If it were not for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I, personally, would not have found a place to settle down in the past twenty years. Some sacrificed martyrs and comrades who have been fighting loyally have guided me, taught me, and some comrades have been advising me for a long time..." From these words, it is even clearer that Hu Feng is "saying one thing and meaning another." He still wants to use flowery words to confuse readers, but this will not work. Hu Feng, you should be honest, frank, and confess to the people, and stop thinking about any deceptive tricks.
    I also hope that Chinese writers and artists will actively criticize Hu Feng and expose Hu Feng's ugly behavior. Hu Feng is a thorough reactionary and an enemy of the people's literary and art front. Comrades, be vigilant!

　  提高警惕，当心胡风的花招
    陈来增
    我是北京师范大学附设工农速成中学的学生。我看了胡风的检讨和舒芜揭发的关于胡风反党材料，非常气愤。他的假检讨是再也骗不了人的。看来胡风装得很正经，检讨得像煞有介事，但和舒芜所揭发的材料对照起来看，很清楚，他简直是个屡教不改的骗子手，一点也不肯说实话，想拿“我的自我批判”的招牌来骗人。正如“人民日报”编者按语所说，不能让胡风利用我们的报纸继续欺骗读者。如果没有舒芜揭发的材料对照，像我们这样的工农学生和群众，不知有多少又得受他的骗。现在他不能再抵赖了，再也不是抵赖的时候了！胡风，你醒醒吧，不要装假正经。十多年来一直是反党反人民的人，还要说什么“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的。一些牺牲了的先烈们和一直忠贞战斗着的同志们引导过我，教导过我，有些同志长期以来规劝过我，……”从这些话里更清楚地看出胡风是“口是心非”的。他还想用花言巧语来迷惑读者，这是不行的。胡风，你应该老实，坦白，向人民交代，不要再想什么欺人的法儿了。
    我也希望中国的文艺家积极批判胡风，揭露胡风丑行。胡风是彻头彻尾的反动家伙，是人民文艺战线的敌人。同志们，警惕啊！
