　　鞍钢上月有十五种主要产品完成国家计划
    新华社鞍山四日电　鞍山钢铁公司四月份有生铁、钢锭、钢坯、大型钢材、无缝钢管、中板和焦炭等十五种主要产品完成了国家计划。
    鞍钢在四月份的劳动竞赛中出现了不少新气象。炼钢厂在四月份共出了一百六十九炉快速炼钢，这是炼钢厂建厂以来快速炼钢最多的一个月，五号平炉工人并在四月六日创造了六点零四分钟炼好一炉钢的新纪录。著名的炼钢能手李绍奎所在的八号平炉，平炉炉顶的使用期限已超过国家定额六十多炉，创造了大型平炉炉顶使用期限的最新纪录。在炼铁厂，七号高炉工人提前一天零二十小时完成了四月份的国家计划，生铁的一级品率超过国家计划百分之八，并且基本上消灭了废品。这是七号高炉近几个月来生产最好的一个月。
