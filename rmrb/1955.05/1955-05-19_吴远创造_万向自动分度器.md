　  Wu Yuan Creates "Universal Automatic Indexing Head"
    Wu Yuan, section chief of the processing workshop of the state-owned Hengyang Mining Machinery Factory in Hunan Province, and a special-class labor model of Hengyang City, recently combined the principle of Wang Chonglun's "universal tool fixture" with the principle of the milling machine indexing head, with the help of technician Luo Zuohua, and successfully created a new tool called the "universal automatic indexing head." On May 7, the factory tested the new tool by installing it on a planer to machine five kinds of parts. The efficiency increased by as much as 34 times, and at the very least more than 5 times. For example, making the opener on the rock drill parts, which originally required one hour to mill the 60-tooth plane teeth on the milling machine; using this new tool to machine on the planer, including auxiliary man-hours, only takes one minute and forty-four seconds. Another example, making the internal gear of the rock drill parts, Wang Chonglun's "universal tool fixture" record was nineteen minutes to manufacture one; using the "universal automatic indexing head", planing
  one only takes five minutes and thirty seconds.
    This new tool can be used on shapers, milling machines, slotting machines and drilling machines. The tool itself can replace workers to do indexing, correcting and marking work. Therefore, it can enable one machine tool to do the work of multiple machine tools, and enable junior technicians to do the work of senior technicians. The emergence of this new tool has solved the problem of unbalanced production equipment in some workshops of the Hengyang Mining Machinery Factory. This tool can also be used in some small and medium-sized machinery factories. At present, many factories in Hengyang City have sent representatives to visit the Hengyang Mining Machinery Factory, preparing to promote it. (Tian Fangmu)

　  吴远创造“万向自动分度器”
    湖南省国营衡阳矿山机械厂加工车间工段长、衡阳市特等劳动模范吴远，最近在技术员骆佐华帮助下，把王崇伦创造的“万能工具胎”原理和铣床分度头原理结合起来，创造成功了一种名叫“万向自动分度器”的新工具。五月七日，经厂方测定，将这个新工具装在刨床上车制五种零件，最高约提高工效三十四倍，最低也提高工效五倍以上。例如做风钻零件上的开闭器，原来在铣床上将六十齿的平面牙齿铣出，需要一小时；利用这个新工具在刨床上车制，连辅助工时在内只需要一分四十四秒。又如做风钻零件内齿轮，王崇伦“万能工具胎”的纪录是制造一个用十九分钟；用“万向自动分度器”，刨
  一个只要五分三十秒。
    这个新工具可以装在牛头刨床、铣床、插床和钻床上使用，工具本身能代替工人做好分度、校正和画线等工作。因此，它能使一种机床做多种机床的活，使低级技工做高级技工的工作。这个新工具的出现，解决了衡阳矿山机械厂部分车间生产设备不平衡的困难。这个工具在一些中小型机械厂也可以使用。目前，衡阳市许多工厂派代表到衡阳矿山机械厂参观，准备加以推广。　（田放牧）
