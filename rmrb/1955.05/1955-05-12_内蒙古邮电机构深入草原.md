　　Now, the vast majority of banners and counties in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region can use telegraphs, telephones, and wireless telephones to connect with various places. The local thousands of postal and telecommunications workers of all ethnic groups deliver a large number of letters, newspapers and magazines published throughout the country to the hands of people of all ethnic groups every day.
　　Before liberation, the vast Ikezhao League on the west bank of the Yellow River had only one postal and telecommunications bureau and one postal and telecommunications business office; now, each banner and county in this league has a postal and telecommunications bureau, and wireless telephones have been newly erected in six banners including Otog Banner and Jasak Banner. Small radio stations have been set up in the Oroqen Autonomous Banner in the deep mountains and dense forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Ergun Banner in the northernmost part of the motherland, and Xilinhot on the Xilin Gol Grassland to copy weather forecasts to avoid sudden snowstorms causing casualties to people and livestock.

　　内蒙古邮电机构深入草原
    现在，内蒙古自治区绝大部分旗、县，都已可以用电报、电话、无线电话和各地联系。当地的几千名各族邮电职工，每天把大批信件、全国各地出版的报纸和杂志，送到各族人民的手里。
    解放前，黄河西岸辽阔千里的伊克昭盟，只有一个邮电局和一个邮电营业处；现在，这个盟的每个旗、县都有了邮电局，鄂托克、扎萨克等六个旗并新架设了无线电话。大兴安岭深山密林中的鄂伦春自治旗、祖国最北部的额尔古纳旗和锡林郭勒大草原上的锡林浩特等地，都架设了小型无线电台，抄收风雪气象预报，避免风雪突然袭击而造成人畜伤亡。（新华社）
