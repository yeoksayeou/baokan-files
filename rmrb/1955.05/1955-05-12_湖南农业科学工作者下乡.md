　　Hunan agricultural scientists go to the countryside
    Nine rural work groups composed of agricultural scientists from the Hunan Provincial Comprehensive Agricultural Experiment Station have set out for rural areas across Hunan to summarize the experiences of farmers in changing single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice, selecting superior varieties, transforming low-yield fields into high-yield fields, and increasing multiple cropping.
    Agricultural scientists from this station conducted more than 200 experiments last year and compiled 15 booklets on crop cultivation techniques, etc. However, it was later found that some of the content did not conform to the current rural production reality and could not be applied in rural areas. Starting this year, they have changed their working methods.
    The work groups that have now arrived in the work areas have participated in the production activities of local agricultural production cooperatives. They will work locally for one year. Some agricultural scientists who remain at the station this year will conduct experimental work in close coordination with rural surveys. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　湖南农业科学工作者下乡
    湖南省综合农业试验站农业科学工作者组成的九个农村工作组，已出发到湖南各地农村去总结农民变单季稻为双季稻、选育良种、变低产田为高产田和增加复种作物的经验。
    这个站的农业科学工作者去年曾做了二百多个试验，编写了十五本有关作物栽培技术等方面的小册子，但后来发现有些内容不符合当前农村生产实际，不能在农村应用。从今年开始，他们改变了工作方法。
    现在到达工作地区的工作组，已参加了当地农业生产合作社的生产活动。他们将在当地工作一年。今年留在站内的一部分农业科学工作者将紧密配合农村调查进行实验工作。（新华社）
