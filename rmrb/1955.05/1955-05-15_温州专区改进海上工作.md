The Wenzhou Special District Improves Maritime Work

A letter from the Commissioner's Office of Wenzhou Special District, Zhejiang Province: The criticism made by a reader in the People's Daily on April 10th regarding the Wenzhou Special District's lack of attention to the safe production of fishermen is correct, and we fully accept this criticism.

After the accident occurred, we immediately made a self-criticism to the provincial leadership, requesting that the higher authorities give us the punishment we deserve; at the same time, we have taken the following measures regarding the aftermath of the maritime accidents and the future safety of fishery production:

First, we organized forces to go to coastal counties to search for missing people and to express our condolences and provide relief to the families of the victims.

Second, we will provide loan support to boats and tools that have been damaged or broken, according to different circumstances, and mobilize the masses to repair them quickly.

Third, we will establish a strict organizational leadership for safe production from top to bottom, transfer capable cadres, and organize the Wenzhou Special District Fishery Production Command. Cooperatives and mutual aid groups will all have safety production committee members to specifically strengthen leadership during the fishing season. The technical standards of experienced fishermen will also be discussed and approved by the masses, new and old fishermen will be appropriately allocated, and radios will be added to collective fishermen.

Fourth, larger storm stations will be set up in Dachen, Pishan, Nanji, and Beiji islands to promptly report sea wind conditions.

Fifth, those who have neglected their duties have been seriously dealt with, and we have conscientiously summarized the painful lessons of the maritime accidents in February and March to educate cadres.

　　温州专区改进海上工作
　　浙江温州区专员公署来信：四月十日人民日报读者对温州专区不重视渔民安全生产的批评，是正确的，我们完全接受这一批评。
　　事故发生后，我们当即向省领导上进行了检讨，请求上级给我们以应得的处分；同时，我们对海损事故的善后工作和今后渔业安全生产方面作了如下措施：
　　一、我们组织了力量，分赴沿海各县，找寻失踪的人，对受难者的家属进行慰问和救济。
　　二、对损失打坏的船只和工具按不同情况给以贷款扶持，动员群众迅速修补。
　　三、从上而下建立严密的安全生产的组织领导，抽调得力干部，组织了温州专区渔业生产指挥部。合作社互助组都设有安全生产委员，具体加强渔汛期间的领导。老大的技术标准也要群众进行讨论和认可，新老渔民进行适当调配，并在集体渔民中增设收音机。
　　四、将在大陈、披山、南、北麂设置较大的暴风站，及时发报海风情况。
　　五、对失职人员已进行严肃的处理，并认真地总结二、三月份海损事故的惨痛教训，教育干部。
