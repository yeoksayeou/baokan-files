Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 4th. To commemorate the tenth anniversary of Germany's liberation, the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany issued a letter to the German people.

The letter to the German people states: May 8, 1955, marks the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Command of the Hitler "Wehrmacht" signing the unconditional surrender document and the final eradication of Nazi rule. This day is a day of defeat for German militarists and monopoly capitalists, but for the German working people and all peace-loving people, it is a day of liberation.

The letter to the German people states: May 8th will forever be a day to thank the Soviet people and army. This day fostered the unbreakable friendship between the German and Soviet peoples and gave the German people an opportunity to reverse their national history and build a peaceful and democratic Germany. May 8th is a day when all patriotic people are proud of the achievements of the German Democratic Republic, and a day to vow to strengthen and consolidate our worker-peasant state power.

The letter to the German people then points out: Today, the evil forces of defeated monopoly capital, Junker landlords, and militarism have resurfaced in West Germany. The patriotic people of Germany will never allow an imperialist, militarist Germany to reappear.

The letter to the German people states: The citizens of the German Democratic Republic will pledge on this year's Liberation Day: We will do everything in our power to promote all-German talks and unite all patriotic people against the treasonous acts of Bonn. We will help our brothers and sisters in West Germany to prevent the implementation of the Paris Accords. We will sign the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World" to express our will to defend peace. We will do everything in our power to strengthen and consolidate the German Democratic Republic and rapidly build the foundations of socialism.

　　纪念德国解放十周年
　　民主德国全国阵线发表告德国人民书
    新华社柏林四日电　民主德国全国阵线全国委员会为纪念德国解放十周年发表告德国人民书。
    告德国人民书说：一九五五年五月八日是希特勒“国防军”最高司令部在无条件投降书上签字以及纳粹统治被最后铲除的十周年纪念日。这一天对于德国的军国主义者和垄断资本家来说，是失败的日子，但是对于德国劳动人民和全体爱好和平的人民来说，是解放的日子。
    告德国人民书说：五月八日将永远是向苏联人民和军队致谢的日子。这个日子促成了德、苏人民间的牢不可破的友谊，给了德国人民一个扭转民族历史、建造一个和平和民主的德国的机会。五月八日是全体爱国人民对德意志民主共和国的成就感到骄傲的日子，是誓愿加强和巩固我们工农政权的日子。
    告德国人民书接着指出：今天被打垮了的独占资本、容克地主和军国主义的邪恶势力在德国西部又重新抬起头了。德国的爱国人民绝不允许帝国主义、军国主义的德国重新出现。
    告德国人民书说：德意志民主共和国的公民将在今年的解放节宣誓：我们将尽一切力量促进全德会谈，团结一切爱国人民反对波恩的叛国行为。我们将帮助西德的兄弟姊妹阻止巴黎协定的实施。我们将在世界和平理事会“告全世界人民书”上签字，以表示我们保卫和平的意志。我们将尽一切力量加强和巩固德意志民主共和国，迅速建成社会主义的基础。
