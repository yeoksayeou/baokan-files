Heilongjiang Province is constructing two large fish farms utilizing Jingpo Lake and Xiao Xingkai Lake. This project is being built by over 600 people working intensely, and it is expected to begin releasing large numbers of fish fry in July. The natural conditions of these two lakes are very good, with a usable water surface area of over 27,000 hectares, more than twice the existing fish farming area in the entire province, capable of stocking 20 million to 30 million fish fry. This year, an initial stocking of 4 million Yangtze River silver carp, bighead carp, and local carp fry will be carried out. After three years of expansion and continuous stocking, it is expected to produce 600,000 to 800,000 catties of delicious fresh fish annually. In the future, once the entire water surface is utilized, the annual output can reach over 10 million catties, creating more than 2 million yuan in wealth for the country. (Wang Xiyuan)

　  黑龙江新建两个大养鱼场
    黑龙江省正在利用镜泊湖、小兴凯湖兴建两个大养鱼场。这一工程正由六百多人紧张兴建，七月即可开始大量放养鱼苗。这两个湖的自然条件很好，能利用的水面达二万七千余垧，比全省现有养鱼水面大两倍以上，可放养鱼苗二千到三千万尾。今年初步放养长江花鲢、白鲢及当地鲤鱼苗四百万尾。三年后经过扩建与连续放养，每年可产美味的鲜鱼六百到八百万斤。将来把整个水面利用后，每年产量可达一千多万斤，能为国家创造二百多万元财富。　　　　（王希元）
