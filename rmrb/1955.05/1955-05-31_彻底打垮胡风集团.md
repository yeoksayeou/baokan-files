　　Thoroughly Crush the Hu Feng Group
　　玛拉沁夫

　　When I was studying in Beijing a few years ago, I initially heard that Hu Feng was stubborn and arrogant, and didn't get along with people. Later, after listening to him give lectures and speak at meetings several times, I sometimes felt that his aesthetic views were indeed contrary to our socialist realism, but sometimes I was also confused by his incomprehensible words that criticized everything and were full of complaints; at that time, like many people, I only thought that Hu Feng's thinking was problematic, and I had no understanding of his now-revealed sinister face, let alone vigilance.

　　I remember that Hu Feng sometimes either kept a straight face and didn't say a word at meetings, or he was as furious as thunder, giving a rambling "beating" of ten thousand words; when he taught classes, he either passionately and with sweat streaming down his face pretended to be a complete "mentor of youth," or he made absurd remarks with implications in his words. Whenever there was a gap, he would take the opportunity to use sweet words to promote his set of "self-expansion," "subjective fighting spirit," and so on. Once, he was originally scheduled to talk about Lu Xun's essays for three hours, but unexpectedly, he went on and on for two days, a total of more than ten hours. The students were very dissatisfied with him. However, we only stopped at "dissatisfaction," and did not know that Hu Feng, who was swaggering in front of us giving lectures, was our most vicious enemy—a sinister enemy who wanted to use a "whip wrapped in rubber to beat prisoners, to wound us without leaving visible scars."

　　Last winter, when I was working on the grasslands, I saw news and articles in the newspapers about the nationwide criticism of Hu Feng's thought. At that time, I felt happy from the bottom of my heart: Hu Feng's thought should have been criticized long ago. However, from that time until recently, I still thought that this was just an academic discussion and ideological struggle, and even estimated that through this criticism, Hu Feng might reform himself. Facts have proved that my estimate was wrong, completely wrong! When I read Hu Feng's false self-criticism and the letters revealed by Shu Wu in the "People's Daily" on May 13th, I was truly shocked and terrified! The truth of the ferocious enemy was completely exposed! He is by no means like what we thought: just a revolutionary writer with ideological problems. No, Hu Feng is definitely not such a person.

　　For more than twenty years, he has been hating and opposing our Party, the literary and artistic cause of our Party, and Party member writers and non-Party progressive writers like a snarling wolf! He attempted to "shake" and "overthrow" our Party's leading position in literature and art, boasting that "everything is prepared in me" and "taking the world as my responsibility"; that is to say, Hu Feng wanted to rule the Chinese literary scene and control everything in Hu Feng's hands. He sent "moles" to many places and many organizations, and also wooed some wavering Party members to act as his agents within the Party, to oppose the Party and the people in an organized, programmatic, strategic way. He is a counter-revolutionary element hidden in the revolutionary ranks.

　　Since the nationwide criticism of Hu Feng's thought began, Hu Feng, seeing that the situation was not good, jumped from active offense to "preliminary" "self-criticism." But the jackal's mask has been completely torn apart, and we will never be deceived by him again! His false self-criticism is a conspiracy and trickery, the most poisonous arrow. We must heighten our vigilance, thoroughly expose his conspiracies and tricks, smash his most poisonous arrows to pieces, thoroughly crush the Hu Feng Group, and kick Hu Feng out of the ranks of people's writers, kick him out!

　　彻底打垮胡风集团
　　玛拉沁夫
    前几年我在北京学习的时候，起初听人说胡风为人固执狂妄，跟人合不来。后来听过他几次讲课和会议上发言，有时感到他的美学观的的确确与我们的社会主义现实主义相违背，但有时也被他那指东骂西，牢骚连篇的难以理解的话语闹得莫名其妙；那时我跟许多人一样，只认为胡风的思想成问题，而对他现今被揭露的罪恶嘴脸，却没有一点了解，更谈不上警惕了。
    记得，胡风有时在会议上不是绷着脸一言不发，就是暴躁如雷，洋洋万言的乱“打”一通；他上课时，不是激昂慷慨，汗流满面的装扮成一个十足的“青年人之导师”的样子，就是话语之间若有所指地大发谬论。只要有点空隙，就乘机花言巧语地来宣扬自己那套什么“自我扩张”啦，“主观战斗精神”啦等等。有一次本来约他讲三个钟头的鲁迅杂文，不料他东拉西扯的接连讲了两天，共十几小时才算罢休。学员们对他都很不满意。然而我们只停留在“不满意”上，并不知道在我们面前大摇大摆讲课的胡风，就是我们最恶毒的敌人——想用
  “橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”把我们“打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”来的阴险无比的敌人。
    去年冬天，我在草地工作时，从报刊上看到全国展开批判胡风思想的消息和论文，当时我打心眼儿里感到痛快：胡风思想早就应该被批判了。然而从那时起，一直到最近我还认为这只是学术讨论和思想斗争，甚至还估计通过这次批判，胡风也许会改过自新的。事实证明，我估计错了，完全错了！当我读了五月十三日“人民日报”上发表的胡风的假检讨和舒芜揭发的信件之后，真是触目惊心，毛骨悚然！凶恶的敌人的真相毕露了！他绝不是像我们所想的那样：只不过是有思想问题的革命作家。不，胡风绝不是这样的人。
    二十多年来他一直就像恶狼一样咬牙切齿的仇恨和反对我们的党，我们党的文艺事业和党员作家与非党进步作家！他企图“动摇”和“打倒”我党在文学艺术中的领导地位，夸口说要“万物皆备于我”“以天下为己任”；也就是说，胡风要统治中国文坛，把一切都要掌握于胡风手中。他在许多地方，许多机关中都派下了“坐探”，并且拉拢一些不坚定的党员，作他的党内代理人，有组织、有纲领、有策略战略的来同党和人民为敌。他是一个暗藏在革命队伍中的反革命分子。
    自从全国展开对胡风思想的批判后，胡风一看势头不好，一跃身从积极进攻变为“初步”的“自我批判”了。但是豺狼的假面具彻底被扯碎了，我们再也不会受他欺骗了！他的假检讨是阴谋诡计，是最有毒性的箭头，我们必须提高警惕，彻底揭穿他的阴谋诡计，要把他那最有毒性的箭头打个尽碎，把胡风集团彻底打垮，把胡风从人民作家行列中踢出去，踢出去！（原载“内蒙古日报”）
