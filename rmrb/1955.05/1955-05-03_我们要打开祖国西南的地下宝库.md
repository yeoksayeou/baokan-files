　　We Are Going to Open the Underground Treasure Trove of Southwest China
　　Southwest Geological Bureau Engineer Liu Zengqian
    The southwest of our motherland is a mountainous region. Beneath the rolling mountains, many places contain abundant mineral deposits. Gejiu, formerly known as "Empty Mountains and Old Caves," has widely distributed placer tin. Imperialists called China a "copper-poor" country, but Yunnan Province alone has nearly a hundred counties with copper mines. The southwest is also a region rich in polymetallic ores, such as lead and zinc, distributed in more than two hundred counties and cities. In one mining area, outcrops appear intermittently in a narrow, elongated zone spanning hundreds of miles. The slag left over from silver mining before liberation can still yield hundreds of thousands of tons of lead and zinc; and past backward mining methods only touched a small part of it. According to reports from the masses, many counties in Guizhou have mercury ore outcrops. A manganese mine with good quality and large reserves is being explored in the southwest. Iron mineralization is also widespread in the southwest. The southwest has the world's longest fiber asbestos and top-grade mica. The Sichuan Basin has a large natural gas reservoir, as well as many rolling coalfields and ideal oilfields. The southwest also produces rare and precious metals such as tungsten, bismuth, molybdenum, cobalt, vanadium, titanium, and platinum; it also has aluminum; agricultural phosphate fertilizer and potash salts, and chemical raw materials such as borax and sulfur. When you stand in front of the colorful and dazzling specimens collected by geologists, when you see the placer tin all over the mountains, the transparent and colorful crystals lining the bright red cinnabar crystals, and the pure white and radiant asbestos, you can proudly tell people: we have the resources needed for socialist and communist construction!
    However, during the period of reactionary rule, these treasures were buried underground for years without anyone caring about them. The so-called geological work was only for window dressing. The total number of people engaged in geological work and geological teaching in the entire southwest was only forty-two. People still remember that the geology department of universities was a "cold" major at that time. Only a handful of people graduated each year, and they could not find jobs. Of course, it was even more unthinkable to have a sound geological organization and excellent geological equipment.
    In the first year of the First Five-Year Plan, in order to change the backward state of geological work, the central government put forward the policy of "great development and great transformation," and transferred a large number of cadres to participate in geological work. Geologists who had changed careers in the past also returned to geological work. The Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries sent a lot of excellent drilling equipment and precision instruments to support our geological work, and sent experts to teach us advanced geological work methods. Now, the geological workforce in the southwest of our motherland has developed into a huge, multi-disciplinary exploration team with modern equipment. New exploration methods such as geophysical prospecting and geochemical prospecting are also gradually being widely adopted. In the past few years, the number of employees in the Southwest Geological Bureau has increased dramatically. Now, the number of people in just one exploration team of the Southwest Geological Bureau (including temporary workers) is more than three thousand five hundred. If the total national investment of the Southwest Geological Bureau in 1952 is 100, then it was 149 in 1953 and 706 in 1954. The total number of drilling rigs in the Southwest Geological Bureau in 1955 will exceed dozens of times that before liberation. The geological work team active in the southwest of our motherland, like the geological teams active in other regions of the motherland, is a newborn team with unlimited youth and vitality. They are marching towards the land of the southwest of our motherland with the spirit of making high mountains bow their heads and floods give way. They want to open the underground treasure trove of the southwest of our motherland. Geological teams have planted flags on countless mountain tops in the southwest of our motherland. The silence of countless remote mountains and wildernesses has been broken by the roar of drilling rig motors and the cheerful songs of the drillers. Trucks loaded with drilling equipment are speeding on the Yunnan-Guizhou and Kangzang Plateau, and high-voltage lines have climbed the snow-capped peaks. Valleys have become towns.
    People often use "pioneers of economic construction" and "vanguards of industrialization" to call geologists. The task of geologists is arduous and glorious. This lofty honor needs to be answered by geologists with hard creative labor, with infinite love for the socialist and communist construction cause of the motherland, and with infinite care for the people of the motherland and their descendants.
    Day and night, geologists trek in remote mountains and fields. They often have to climb high mountains and ridges thousands of meters above sea level and wade through chest-deep rivers. They have to fight against the ever-changing plateau climate. Roads are opened up by brave geologists, and mountains are conquered by geologists. At night, they light bonfires in the mountains to discuss the day's work and tomorrow's plans. Whenever they use their hammers to knock out shining ore, they forget all their fatigue. They see the people's future beautiful life in the ore.
    Geologists have received the care, support, and help of local Party committees, governments, and people of all ethnic groups in their work. Whenever a geological team arrives in a place, the responsible comrades of the county and district Party committees and governments carefully introduce them to local customs and help them overcome various difficulties, and publicize the work of reporting mines to the masses. When the Gejiu exploration team needed cadres the most in 1954, the Gejiu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a large number of outstanding cadres to support the exploration team. The masses cared for the geological team members like they cared for their own relatives. They actively prepared food for the geological team members, arranged accommodation, and helped the geological team members with their work. The Miao township head and village cadres of Malan Township, Yongshan County, Yunnan Province, personally led farmers to help the survey team dig trenches and explore, and repeatedly refused to accept wages. In the Liangshan area, when the clothes of the comrades of the survey team were wet by the rain, the Yi farmers made a fire for them to dry. The masses also actively reported mines to the Geological Bureau and the exploration team. The Southwest Geological Bureau alone received reports from the masses of 2,310 mineral sites in the past five years. Yang Delin, an eighty-four-year-old miner in Yunnan, climbed the nearby high mountains and deep valleys in the old society to find iron ore, but never told anyone. But after the survey team went, he immediately reported two iron mines and one copper mine to the survey team, and also asked to lead the survey team to find mines. Liu Zhengshang, an iron worker from Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, carried sweet potatoes into the deep mountains to find mines. He successively reported twenty-one mineral sites to the Southwest Geological Bureau. Geologists know how to answer the trust and support of the masses.
    The mineral resources in the southwest are abundant. The Kuomintang reactionary government left the southwest with only a geological map full of blank areas. More than 70% of the land in the southwest has not yet been set foot by geologists. Especially the Kangzang Plateau, it is almost still an uncultivated virgin land. It is conceivable how many undiscovered secrets there are in the underground treasure trove of the southwest of our motherland! It will take more and harder work to uncover it. However, we can proudly say that the geologists living in the new China are indestructible. They will never fail to live up to the glorious title given to them by the people. Let the geologists plant the flags of the geological team all over the southwest of the motherland, turn the wilderness into cities, and extract the minerals hidden deep underground to serve the people of the motherland.

　　我们要打开祖国西南的地下宝库
　　西南地质局工程师　刘增乾
    祖国的西南是一片多山的地带，在绵延起伏的山峦下，许多地方蕴藏了丰富的矿藏。旧时候被人称为“洞老山空”的个旧，有分布很广的砂锡。帝国主义称我国是一个“贫铜”的国家，然而就在我国云南一省就有近百个县有铜矿。西南更是一个富有多金属矿的地区，如铅、锌分布在二百多县市，在其中的一个矿区，露头断续地出现在数百里的狭长地带内。只解放前开采银子时遗留下来的矿渣中，就可提炼出数十万吨铅和锌；而过去落后的开采方式，只不过动了它的很少的一部分而已。根据群众报矿资料，贵州不少的县都有水银矿苗。西南正在勘探一个质量好、储量大的锰矿。西南铁矿的矿化现象也很普遍。西南有世界上纤维最长的石棉、特等品种的云母。在四川盆地有很大的天然气库，还有许多连绵起伏的煤田和理想的油田。西南也出产钨、铋、钼、钴、钒、钛、铂等稀有金属和贵重金属；也有铝；有农业用的磷肥、钾盐，有硼砂、硫磺等化工原料。当你置身在地质人员采回的五色缤纷、灿烂夺目的标本面前的时候，当你看到那满山遍野的砂锡、透明多彩的水晶衬托着鲜红色的朱砂结晶和洁白光彩的石棉时，你也很可以自豪地告诉人们：我们具备着社会主义和共产主义建设所需要的资源！
    但是，在反动统治时期，这些宝藏却被长年累月地埋葬在地下无人过问，所谓地质工作也只不过是为了粉饰门面而已。整个西南从事地质工作和地质教学的总共才四十二人。人们都还记得，那时的大学地质系是“冷门”，每年毕业出来寥寥可数的几个人，也找不到工作做，当然更不能设想有健全的地质组织机构和优良的地质设备了。
    在第一个五年计划的头一年，为着改变地质工作的落后状态，中央提出了“大发展大转变”的方针，抽调了大批干部参加地质工作。过去改了行的地质工作者也回到了地质工作岗位。苏联和各人民民主国家运了很多优良的钻探设备和精密仪器来支援我们的地质工作，并派来专家教给我们先进的地质工作方法。到现在，祖国西南的地质工作力量已经发展成为一支巨大的、具有现代化装备的多兵种勘探队伍，而物理探矿、化学探矿等新型的勘探方法，也正逐渐地被广泛采用。几年来，西南地质局的职工人数剧增，现在仅西南地质局一个勘探队的人（包括临时工）就有三千五百多个。若以一九五二年西南地质局国家投资总数为一百，则一九五三年为一百四十九，一九五四年为七百零六。一九五五年西南地质局的钻机总数将超过解放前的数十倍。活跃在祖国西南的地质工作队伍，跟活跃在祖国其他地区的地质队伍一样，是一支新生的具有无限青春活力的队伍，他们正以使高山低头、洪水让路的气概，向着祖国西南的大地进军，他们要打开祖国西南的地下宝库。地质队在祖国西南的无数山头上插起了旗子，无数深山僻野被钻机的马达声和钻工们愉快的歌声划破了沉寂，满载着钻探器材的卡车奔驰在云贵和康藏高原上，高压线爬上了白云皑皑的山峰。山谷变成了市镇。
    人们常用“经济建设的开路先锋”“工业化的尖兵”来称呼地质工作者，地质工作者的任务是很艰巨而光荣的。这种崇高的荣誉需要地质工作者用艰苦的创造性的劳动，用对祖国的社会主义和共产主义建设事业的无限热爱，用对祖国人民和他们的后代的无限关怀来回答的。
    日日夜夜，地质工作者们跋涉在人迹罕到的山野。他们时常要登上拔海数千公尺的高山峻岭，涉过淹胸的河水。要同变化无常的高原气候作斗争。一条一条的路被勇敢的地质工作者走出来了，一个一个的山峰被地质工作者征服了。夜晚，他们在山间升起了一堆堆篝火，谈论一天的工作和明天的计划。每当他们用自己的钉锤敲出了闪亮的矿石，他们就忘记了所有的疲劳。他们在矿石里看到了人民未来美好的生活。
    地质工作者在工作中得到了地方党、政府和各族人民的关怀，支持和帮助。地质队每到一个地方。县、区党委和政府的负责同志都细心地向他们介绍当地的风俗习惯，帮助他们克服各种困难，并向群众宣传报矿工作。当一九五四年个旧勘探队最需要干部的时候，中共个旧市委派出了大批的优秀干部来支援勘探队。群众关心地质队队员像关心自己的亲人一样，他们积极为地质队队员准备粮食，安置住处，并帮助地质队队员们工作。云南省永善县马兰乡的苗族乡长和村干部亲自领导农民帮助普查队挖槽探，并再三拒绝接受工资。在凉山区，普查队的同志被雨打湿了衣服，彝族农民替他们生火烤干。群众还积极地向地质局和勘探队报矿，仅西南地质局五年来接到群众报告的矿产地就有二千三百一十处。云南有一个八十四岁的老矿工杨德林，在旧社会里，爬遍附近高山深谷找到了铁矿，从未告诉过别人。但是普查队去后，他立刻就向普查队报告了两处铁矿和一处铜矿，并且还要求要给普查队带路去找矿。四川省奉节县铁工刘正尚，背着红苕到深山里去找矿，他连续向西南地质局报告了二十一处矿产地。地质工作者知道应该怎样来回答群众对他们的信任和支持。
    西南的矿产是丰富的，国民党反动政府给西南留下来的只是一张布满了空白区域的地质图。西南百分之七十以上的土地还没有踏上地质工作者的足迹。尤其是康藏高原，几乎还是一块未被开垦的处女地。可以想像，祖国西南的地下宝库中，还有多少没有被发掘的秘密！还要付出更多更艰苦的劳动才能揭开它。然而我们可以自豪地说，生活在新中国的地质工作者是无坚不摧的。他们绝不辜负人们所赋予的光荣称号。让地质工作者们把地质队的旗帜插遍祖国西南的大地，让荒野变成城市，把隐藏在地下深处的矿产开采出来为祖国人民服务。
