Title: The Bankruptcy of the American Conspiracy to Sabotage the Asian-African Conference

　　The Asian-African Conference achieved success. The results of the conference reflected the common aspirations of the Asian and African peoples for peace, friendship, and national independence. Public opinion in various countries has widely pointed out that the achievements of the conference are conducive to easing international tensions and promoting peace throughout the world, especially in the Asian and African regions. Therefore, it has been universally welcomed by the people of all countries.

　　However, people have noticed the abnormal reaction from Washington regarding the results of the Asian-African Conference. The US government initially remained silent about the achievements of the conference, saying it would "closely watch" the conference communiqué without making "formal comments." Subsequently, after public opinion in various countries universally welcomed the achievements of the conference, US Secretary of State Dulles even attempted to distort the conference's achievements. He issued a statement saying that the United States "welcomed" the results of the Asian-African Conference and that the results were "as expected" by the United States.

　　It is clear at a glance how hypocritical Dulles's remarks are. Everyone remembers that when the prime ministers of the five South Asian countries announced the convening of the Asian-African Conference last December, Washington's reaction was "unease," "worry," and "panic." Dulles purposefully said that the Bogor Conference communiqué was "vague," and US officials even slandered the communiqué announcing the convening of the Asian-African Conference as "hypocritical."

　　According to US newspapers, the reason for US unease was that the Bogor Conference communiqué unambiguously announced the purpose of the Asian-African Conference, which ran counter to Washington's colonialist policies and policies of preparing for new wars in the region. The US aggressor bloc was particularly afraid of representatives from Asian and African countries sitting together to discuss common issues concerning Asian and African countries in a spirit of harmonious consultation. In the words of the Americans themselves, this would cause Asian and African countries to "bypass the path planned by Washington." Before the Asian-African Conference was held, the US "Chicago Sun-Times" said, "Washington is particularly dissatisfied that issues such as demanding a halt to nuclear weapons testing will be raised at the conference, while the United States has recently decided to continue such testing." Reuters correspondent in Washington, Ross Mark, reported that the US government was concerned that the Asian-African Conference would discuss "issues related to national sovereignty and issues of racism and colonialism." The "New York Times" also admitted that the United States was worried that the Asian-African Conference might "accept the principles drafted by Nehru and Zhou Enlai last summer."

　　Therefore, the United States sought to sabotage the conference from beginning to end.

　　This sabotage activity began as early as when the prime ministers of the five South Asian countries were brewing the launch of this conference. Indonesian Deputy Speaker of Parliament Aruji pointed out as early as August 8 last year that the United States was "using dishonest methods to try to create divisions among the Colombo countries and hinder the convening of the Asian-African Conference." After the Bogor Conference decided to launch the Asian-African Conference, the US ruling clique instructed certain Asian and African countries to "boycott" the conference. The US "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" pointed out at the time: "The United States hopes that the Asian-African Conference will not be held at all."

　　However, the "obstruction" and "boycott" of the conference failed, and Dulles decided to change his strategy, concocting a hypocritical resolution at the Bangkok Conference to "congratulate" the Asian-African Conference, pretending as if Washington had always welcomed the convening of such a conference. In fact, behind the smoke screen of "congratulations," US envoys in the Far East were discussing strategies to sabotage the Asian-African Conference.

　　The Indian "Blitz" weekly exposed, and later facts also proved, that the main strategy determined by the United States to sabotage the Asian-African Conference was to try its best to obliterate the common aspirations of Asian and African countries, create and expand differences among participating countries, in order to make the conference fall into division and endless quarrels and fail to achieve anything. In the words of the "New York Herald Tribune," the expectation was that the conference would become "a stage specifically built to display opposing opinions."

　　Washington's plan was to achieve this strategy through its servants. United Press International revealed on March 23 that the US State Department had drafted a "document" and delivered it to "friendly countries" participating in the Asian-African Conference for circulation. The Indian "Statesman" pointed out: Certain countries participating in the conference that had military alliance treaties with the United States had been instructed by the United States: "To oppose every opinion that appears to be beneficial to Russia or China."

　　At the same time, the US Information Service of the State Department successively published several so-called "background materials" that tampered with history and reversed black and white on the eve of the opening of the Asian-African Conference, shamelessly defending the colonial rule of the United States and other colonial countries in the Asian and African regions and the war policy of organizing aggressive military blocs. It also slandered the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, falsely accusing our country of carrying out "colonial" and "subversive" activities, attempting to use this pile of absurd fallacies to divert the common vision of Asian and African countries of opposing colonialism and supporting peace, and preparing public opinion for certain countries to stir up trouble at the Asian-African Conference.

　　Under the instigation of this US conspiracy, the Asian-African Conference did encounter one adverse current after another during its proceedings. From Washington's eager reaction to certain phenomena at the conference that deviated from the basic spirit of the conference, it can be seen how anxiously the United States had hoped that its sabotage activities would achieve results.

　　Everyone saw that when representatives of a few countries departed from the established purpose and agenda of the conference, attempting to provoke ideological disputes to obstruct the normal progress of the conference, the US conspirators immediately expressed "extreme elation." Washington's State Department officials and legislators keen on enslaving the Asian and African people issued a chorus of cheers. US Senator Sparkman even became giddy with success and said that this was "the role played by the US economic aid program." The US reactionary newspapers and news agencies sensationally shouted "Bandung differences expand," the conference "deadlocked"...

　　When the conference overcame these obstacles and moved towards success under the cooperative desires expressed by the majority of representatives, the United States also planned and launched what a reporter from the US "Christian Science Monitor" called a "final attack," putting forward unreasonable demands to split our country's territory and interfere in our country's internal affairs. The US propaganda machine took this opportunity to publicize it greatly, attempting to cast a shadow over the Asian-African Conference. The "New York Daily News" published an editorial titled "Long Live Bandung," praising the activities of the "Western friends in the East" to sabotage the atmosphere of the conference. The Associated Press did not conceal the role of the behind-the-scenes planners in Washington for these activities, saying triumphantly: "The United States participated in a scene that it supposedly was not participating in."

　　Until the last moment of the conference, the US propaganda machine was still trying its best to create the impression that the Asian-African Conference was of no benefit. For example, the "New York Herald Tribune" said on April 23: "The most constructive achievement of the Asian-African Conference is its expression of disunity." It also described the atmosphere of friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries displayed near the end of the conference as "deceptive, and therefore will neither be conducive to peace nor conducive to freedom."

　　However, Washington's conspirators failed. The common demands of Asian and African countries to unanimously seek friendly cooperation, uphold peace, and oppose colonialism overwhelmed all adverse currents. Under the joint efforts of the majority of countries and the unanimous support of public opinion in Asian and African countries, twenty-nine countries unanimously adopted principles on economic and cultural cooperation, opposition to colonialism, and promotion of world peace and cooperation, affirming the common desire of Asian and African countries to advocate international friendly cooperation, national independence, and peace. The conference finally progressed and achieved results not according to the path planned by the US ruling clique, but according to the demands of the Asian and African people.

　　Therefore, Washington, faced with the established fact that the Asian-African Conference had been successful, had to issue hypocritical statements in an attempt to conceal its failure and ease its isolated situation. It is still trying to salvage its failure. It is now trying its best to distort and interpret the achievements of the conference according to the interests of imperialism, and trying to undermine the positive impact of this achievement.

　　However, the achievements of the Asian-African Conference can never be distorted and belittled by Washington's ruling clique. Since the United States was unable to obstruct and sabotage the convening and victory of the conference, it will certainly not be able to obstruct the far-reaching impact of the achievements of the Asian-African Conference on the Asian and African situation and world peace.

　　美国破坏亚非会议阴谋的破产
　　冯之丹
    亚非会议取得了成就。会议的结果反映了亚非人民和平、友好和民族独立的共同愿望。各国舆论广泛指出，会议的成就有利于缓和国际紧张局势，促进全世界，特别是亚非地区的和平。因此，它受到各国人民的普遍欢迎。
    但是人们注意到华盛顿方面对于亚非会议结果的不正常的反应。美国政府开始时对于会议的成就表示缄默，说要“密切注视”会议公报，而不加“正式评论”。继之在各国舆论普遍对会议的成就表示欢迎之后，美国国务卿杜勒斯还想歪曲会议的成就。他发表声明，表示美国“欢迎”亚非会议的结果，并且说，会议结果正如美国“所预期的”。
  一望可知，杜勒斯的这种言论是多么的虚伪。大家记得，去年十二月底南亚五国总理宣布召开亚非会议，当时华盛顿的反应是“不安”、“忧虑”和
  “慌张”。杜勒斯别有用心地说，茂物会议的公报是“含糊的”，美国官员们甚至诬蔑这个宣布召开亚非会议的公报是“伪善的”。
    根据美国报刊透露，美国之所以不安，就是由于茂物会议的公报毫不含糊地宣布了亚非会议的目的，是和华盛顿在这个地区推行的殖民主义政策、准备新战争的政策背道而驰的。美国侵略集团特别害怕亚非国家的代表坐在一起以和谐协商的精神讨论有关亚非各国的共同问题，用美国人自己的说法，这样就会使亚非国家“撇开华盛顿所规划的途径”。亚非会议举行之前，美国“芝加哥太阳时报”曾说，“华盛顿尤其不满的是在会议上将提出这一类的问题，如像要求停止核子武器的试验等，而美国在最近已决定继续进行这种试验。”路透社驻华盛顿记者罗斯·马克报道，美国政府对亚非会议将讨论“有关民族主权的问题和种族主义及殖民主义的问题”表示忧虑。“纽约时报”还承认，美国担心亚非会议可能“接受尼赫鲁和周恩来在去年夏天拟订的原则”。
    因此美国从头到尾是想法破坏这个会议。
    这种破坏活动早在南亚五国总理酝酿发起这次会议的时候就开始了。印度尼西亚国会第二副议长阿鲁齐在去年八月八日就曾指出：美国“利用不光明正大的方式，企图在科伦坡国家间制造分裂，并阻挠召开亚非会议”。在茂物会议决定了发起召开亚非会议之后，美国统治集团又曾指使某些亚非国家来“抵制”这个会议。美国“圣路易邮报”当时曾经指出：“美国希望根本就不召开亚非会议。”
    可是“阻挠”和“抵制”会议的召开都未能得逞，杜勒斯这才决定改变策略，在曼谷会议上搞了一个“祝贺”亚非会议的伪善的决议，装出一副好像华盛顿自来就欢迎召开这样的会议的样子。而实际上，在“祝贺”的烟幕后面，美国驻远东使节已在会商破坏亚非会议的方策。
    印度“闪电”周报曾经揭露，后来的事实也证明：美国确定破坏亚非会议的主要方策就是：极力抹煞亚非各国的共同愿望，在与会国中制造和扩大分歧，以图使会议陷于分裂和无休止的争吵中而不能有所成就。用“纽约先驱论坛报”的话来说，就是指望会议成为“一个专门为显示相反意见而建立的舞台”。
    华盛顿的计划是通过它的仆从，来实现这一方策。合众社在三月二十三日透露，美国国务院曾拟出一个“文件”，交付参加亚非会议的“友好国家”传阅。印度“政治家报”指出：与会的某些同美国订有军事联盟条约的国家，都曾被美国训令：“要反对看来是对俄国或中国有利的每一意见。”
    与此同时，国务院的美国新闻处在亚非会议开幕前夕连续发表了几次篡改历史、颠倒黑白的所谓
  “背景材料”，为美国以及其他殖民国家在亚非地区的殖民主义统治和组织侵略军事集团的战争政策进行无耻的辩护，并且诽谤和平共处的五项原则，诬蔑我国进行“殖民”和“颠覆”活动，企图以这
  一大堆荒谬谰言来转移亚非各国共同的反对殖民主义、拥护和平的视线，并为某些国家在亚非会议上兴风作浪准备舆论。
    在美国的这种阴谋策动之下，亚非会议在进行中的确也曾经遭遇到一股又一股的逆流。从华盛顿对于会议上所发生的某些背离会议基本精神的现象的热切反应，可以看出美国曾经如何焦急地期望它的破坏活动获得效果。
    大家看到，当少数国家的代表离开会议的既定目的和议程，企图挑起关于思想意识的争论以阻碍会议的正常进行的时候，美国阴谋家们立刻表示
  “欢欣异常”。华盛顿的国务院官员和热中于奴役亚非人民的议员们发出一片叫好声。美国参议员斯巴克曼甚至得意忘形地说这是“美国经济援助计划所起的作用”。美国反动报纸和通讯社则耸人听闻地叫喊“万隆分歧扩大”，会议“陷于僵局”……。
    当会议在大多数代表所表现的合作愿望下克服这些障碍而走向成功时，美国还策划发动了一个美国“基督教科学箴言报”记者称之为“最后攻击”，提出割裂我国领土和干涉我国内政的无理主张。美国宣传机器又借此大事宣传，企图给亚非会议蒙上阴影。“纽约每日新闻”用“万隆万岁”为标题发表社论称赞“西方的东方朋友”的破坏会议空气的活动。美联社毫不掩饰华盛顿对这些活动的幕后策划者的作用，得意地说：“美国参加了照说它不参加演出的一幕戏”。
    直到会议的最后一刻，美国宣传机器还在竭力想造成亚非会议一无好处的印象。例如“纽约先驱论坛报”在四月二十三日还说：“亚非会议最有建设性的成就是它的不团结的表现。”它还把会议在接近结束时所表现的亚非国家间友好合作的气氛，说成是“欺骗性的，因此就既不会有利于和平，也不会有利于自由”。
      但是，华盛顿的阴谋家们失败了，亚非各国一致地谋求友好合作、拥护和平、反对殖民主义的共同要求，压倒了一切逆流。在大多数国家的共同努力和亚非各国舆论的一致支持下，二十九个国家一致通过关于经济文化合作、反对殖民主义和促进世界和平和合作的原则，肯定了亚非国家主张国际友好合作、民族独立和和平的共同愿望。会议终于不是按照美国统治集团所规划的路线而是按照亚非人民的要求进展并取得了结果。
    因此，华盛顿面临着亚非会议业已成功的既成事实，就不得不发表伪善的声明，以图掩饰自己的失败，缓和自己的孤立局面。它还在力图挽回自己的失败。它现在正竭力按照帝国主义的利益来歪曲解释会议的成就，并设法破坏这一成就的积极影响。
    但是，亚非会议的成就决不是华盛顿的统治集团所能歪曲和贬低得了的。美国既然无能阻挠和破坏会议的召开和胜利，当然也不能阻挠亚非会议的成就对亚非局势和世界和平扩展深远的影响。
