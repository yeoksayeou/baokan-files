The local state-owned Ningbo Iron Factory in Zhejiang Province's Ningbo Special District, beloved by the farmers, has been particularly busy during this year's spring plowing season. The workers have been working day and night to manufacture a large number of water pump engines for the farmers and to trial-produce paddy field plows for them. The technicians who were sent to Beijing, Xuzhou, and other places at the end of 1954 to learn the technology for manufacturing paddy field plows have already returned to the factory in succession. On April 1, the work of trial-producing improved agricultural implements, paddy field plows, was fully launched. The workshop where the veteran worker Li Genhua, who once went to the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory to learn wood mold making technology, is located, has already completed the trial production of the paddy field plow model ahead of schedule. This factory has manufactured many agricultural implements for farmers in the past few years. The water pump engines produced for farmers in just over two years are enough to supply more than 450,000 mu of land for mechanical irrigation. This year, 141 water pump engines have been prepared for spring plowing production.

Around the beginning of spring plowing, the factory sent many skilled workers to various rural areas to help farmers install and repair agricultural implements. The workers who went to the countryside sometimes traveled forty or fifty li a day to install agricultural machinery for farmers and help with test runs; some workers went to the countryside on Saturday nights and returned to the factory on Sunday nights, and still worked as usual on Monday without wanting to rest. The factory constantly receives letters from farmers, some requesting assistance in repairing water pumps, and others requesting short-term technical training at the factory. Since February 13, batches of farmers (mostly members of agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams) who requested to come to the factory to learn how to use new agricultural implements and repair techniques have been arriving at the factory. Qiu Deming, a member of the Xingfu Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Hengshan Township, Yuyao County, was recommended by the cooperative to come to the factory to learn the technology. With the help of workers and technicians, in less than a month, he had learned enough technology to meet the standard of a farmer water pump operator.

The new agricultural implements such as water pumps produced by the Ningbo Iron Factory have already shown a considerable effect in improving agricultural production. The paddy fields in the Ningfeng Township area of Yinjiang District, Yinxian County, used to be "droughts two out of three years." In the spring of 1954, workers from the Ningbo Iron Factory helped farmers in Yinjiang District establish the first pumping station using their own manufactured water pumps. During the autumn harvest of that year, farmers in the irrigated area obtained an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average yield of 538 jin of rice per mu on more than 5,000 mu of land, an increase of 380,000 jin of grain compared to 1952, the highest yield in history.

The workers of the Ningbo Iron Factory have established a close friendship with their farmer brothers. Many farmers often come to the factory to visit, and the factory often receives letters from farmers expressing their gratitude for their support. Farmers from Ningyu Township, Yinxian County, presented the Ningbo Iron Factory with a silk banner with the words: "Thank you, worker elder brothers, for making our thousands of years of farming dependent on the sky now dependent on water pumps instead of the sky." The workers hung this banner in one workshop after another in rotation. This banner has become a force to encourage all the workers in the factory to actively produce.

　　积极为农业生产服务的宁波铁工厂
　　傅亦民　戴士清
    受到浙江省宁波专区农民爱戴的地方国营宁波铁工厂，今年春耕生产期间特别繁忙。职工们夜以继日地为农民制造大量抽水机引擎，为农民试制水田犁。一九五四年底派到北京、徐州等地学习制造水田犁技术的技术员早已陆续回厂。四月一日，全面展开了试制改良农具水田犁的工作。曾经到北京农业机械厂学习木模制作技术的老工人李根华所在的车间，已经提前完成水田犁模型的试制工作。这个工厂几年当中为农民制造了许多农具。仅两年多来为农民生产的抽水机引擎，就足够供给四十五万多亩土地进行机械灌溉时使用。今年为春耕生产准备的抽水机引擎有一百四十一台。
    春耕开始前后，工厂派了许多技术好的工人到各地农村帮助农民安装和修补农具。下乡工人有时候一天赶四、五十里路为农民安装农业机器，帮助试车；有的工人星期六晚上赶到乡下，星期日晚上回厂，星期一还照常工作不肯休息。工厂里不断收到农民的来信，有的要求帮助修理抽水机，有的要求到工厂进行短时间技术学习。从二月十三日起，要求到工厂学习使用新式农具和修理技术的农民（大部分是农业生产合作社社员和互助组组员），已经一批批来到工厂。余姚县横山乡幸福农业生产合作社社员裘德明，被社里推派到工厂来学习技术。在工人和技术人员的帮助下，不到一个月的时间，他学习的技术已经够得上一个农民抽水机手的标准。
    宁波铁工厂生产的抽水机等新式农具，对于提高农业生产已经显示出不小的作用。鄞县鄞江区宁锋乡一带的水稻田，过去经常是“三年就有两年旱”。一九五四年春天，宁波铁工厂的工人用自己制造的抽水机帮助鄞江区农民建立了第一个抽水机站。这一年秋收的时候，灌溉区农民获得了空前的丰收，五千多亩田平均每亩收水稻五百三十八斤，比历史上产量最高的一九五二年增产粮食三十八万斤。
    宁波铁工厂工人已经同农民弟兄建立了亲密的友谊。许多农民常到工厂来参观访问，工厂里常常收到农民的来信，对他们的支援表示感谢。鄞县宁余乡农民送给宁波铁工厂一面锦旗，上面写着：“感谢工人老大哥使我们几千年的靠天田，从此靠抽水机不靠天”。工人们把这面锦旗一个车间一个车间地轮流着挂。这面锦旗已经成为一种鼓舞全厂工人积极生产的力量。
