Title: The Public Security Academy Should Not Have Built an Auditorium as a Grand Theater

　　To the Editors:

　　I am writing to expose the serious waste occurring in the construction at the Central Public Security Academy.

　　In 1954, the Public Security Academy, citing a lack of classrooms, proposed a construction plan for 10,000 square meters of buildings, including an auditorium, dormitories, and classrooms. At that time, due to financial difficulties, only 1 million yuan was approved for construction costs. After receiving this construction fund, the Public Security Academy planned to build a 3,000 square meter auditorium and a 1,000 square meter classroom building, constructing both together, with a total cost of 820,000 yuan.

　　This is a construction project with serious waste and detachment from actual needs. Under the pretext of building an auditorium and classrooms, they designed a magnificent and grand theater, occupying a total area of 4,160 square meters, exceeding the approved area by 160 square meters. This theater-style auditorium has three floors and 2,500 seats. The original plan to build 1,000 square meters of classrooms was changed to four small rooms, totaling more than 300 square meters, which in reality became disguised dressing rooms and lounges. The front entrance porch of the auditorium features eight artificial stone pillars extending straight to the top. In front of the first and second floor lobbies, there are luxurious and comfortable lounges, each 8 meters wide and 29 meters long, with terrazzo floors, painted ceilings, and walls adorned with so-called national-style architraves and brackets, as well as elaborate men's and women's restrooms and cloakrooms. Below the stage in the front of the hall (actually a stage) is a music pit, and above is a fly loft with trolley and hoist equipment. The hall has lighting rooms, stage management rooms, control rooms, effects rooms, recording rooms, and distribution rooms on all three floors. On both sides of the hall, there are three-meter-wide corridors on all three floors. In order to pursue the aesthetic appeal of the interior of the auditorium, they embellished the walls with many unnecessary architraves, brackets, eyebrow covers, and other decorations.

　　This theater-style auditorium is even larger than the newly built Tianqiao Theater in Beijing; the Tianqiao Theater has only 1,600 seats and costs 180 yuan per square meter, while the Public Security Academy's "auditorium" has 2,500 seats and costs nearly 200 yuan per square meter.

　　This extravagant waste by the Public Security Academy is inseparable from the school leadership's departmentalism in thinking. In 1951, when the country was recovering the national economy and facing financial difficulties, they built beautiful residences for leading cadres, office buildings, barber shops, and bathrooms, but failed to build the urgently needed classrooms. During the construction of the office building, the leading comrade in charge of capital construction was administratively punished for extravagance and waste, but they did not learn from the lesson and instead became even more extravagant and wasteful in the construction of the auditorium this time.

　　Currently, the construction project of the Public Security Academy is still in progress. In order to avoid causing greater losses to the country, we suggest that relevant departments immediately conduct an investigation and take effective measures to correct this extravagant and wasteful behavior.　Xiu Bin

### 公安学院不该把礼堂建成大剧院

　　公安学院不该把礼堂建成大剧院编辑同志：
    我向你们揭发中央公安学院在建筑中严重的浪费行为。
    公安学院在一九五四年曾以缺乏教室为名提出修建一万平方公尺的建筑计划，包括礼堂、宿舍、教室等工程项目。当时因为经费困难，只批准建筑费一百万元。公安学院领到这笔建筑费以后，拟定修建三千平方公尺的礼堂和一千平方公尺的教室，两项合并在一起修建，全部造价共计八十二万元。
    这是一项存在严重浪费、脱离实际需要的建筑工程。他们以建筑礼堂、教室为借口，设计了一座壮丽美观、规模宏大的剧院，占用面积共四千一百六十平方公尺，超过批准面积一百六十平方公尺。这座剧院式的礼堂有三层，设有二千五百个座位。原计划修建一千平方公尺的教室改为四个小房间，共有三百多平方公尺，实际上成为变相的化装室和休息室。礼堂的正面入口前廊处是八根直通到顶的人造石柱子。在一、二层大厅的前面各有一间八公尺宽，二十九公尺长的华丽舒畅的休息厅，厅内是水磨石地面，彩画的天花板和点缀着所谓民族形式的额枋、雀替的墙壁、讲究的男女厕所和衣帽间。大厅正面的讲台（实际上是舞台）下面是音乐池，上面是带有滑车和吊杆设备的天桥。大厅上下三层分别设有灯光室、舞台监督室、操纵室、效果间、录音室和配电室等。大厅两旁上下三层是三公尺宽的走廊。他们为了追求礼堂内部的美观，在墙壁上点缀了许多不必要的额枋、雀替、眉罩等花饰。
    这座剧院式的礼堂比北京新建的天桥剧场还要大；天桥剧场只有一千六百个座位，每平方公尺造价一百八十元，而公安学院的“礼堂”却有二千五百个座位，每平方公尺造价近二百元。
    公安学院这种铺张浪费的行为和学校领导思想上的本位主义是分不开的。他们在一九五一年国家正在恢复国民经济，财政情况困难的条件下就修建了漂亮的首长住宅、办公大楼和理发室、浴室等，对于迫切需要的教室却没有修建。在修建办公大楼时，因铺张浪费，主管基本建设的领导同志就受过行政上的处分，但是他们没有接受教训，反而在这次修建礼堂的工程中更加铺张浪费。
    现在，公安学院的建筑工程还在进行，为了避免给国家造成更大的损失，我们建议有关部门立即进行调查，采取有效措施纠正这种铺张浪费的行为。　秀彬
