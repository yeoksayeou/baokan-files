Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: According to TASS, Józef Cyrankiewicz, head of the Polish People's Republic delegation, delivered the opening speech at the Warsaw Conference on European Security for European Peace on the 11th.

Cyrankiewicz first extended a heartfelt welcome on behalf of the Polish government and people to the delegations from the participating countries.

Cyrankiewicz then said that five months have passed since our last gathering in Moscow. In the declaration we adopted in Moscow, we expressed a clear attitude towards the actions of Western countries in reviving German militarism and turning West Germany into an outpost of an aggressive military bloc. The Moscow meeting stated that if the Paris Agreements were ratified, the participating countries would take concrete measures. As a result of pressure from the ruling groups in the United States, the aggressive Paris Agreements were ratified.

During this period, we further exchanged views on the issue of our joint defense work, particularly on the conclusion of a treaty of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance, and on the organization of a joint command of our armed forces.

Cyrankiewicz said that a major task lies before this conference, because we must discuss concrete ways to ensure the security of our countries, in order to safeguard European peace.

While resolutely advancing along the road of guaranteeing our security and independence, we will not miss any opportunity to strive for the relaxation of international tensions and to stop the insane arms expansion planned by imperialist and militarist groups. Therefore, the Warsaw Conference is of great significance.

Cyrankiewicz emphasized that the Warsaw Conference will take a major step forward on the road to realizing the principle of collective security, and it will erect a powerful obstacle to block the aggressive conspiracies of the militarists and revanchists who are reviving Hitler's "Wehrmacht."

Cyrankiewicz concluded by wishing the conference a complete success.

　　西伦凯维兹在华沙会议上致开幕词
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社华沙讯：波兰人民共和国代表团团长约·西伦凯维兹，十一日在欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议华沙会议上致开幕词。
    西伦凯维兹首先代表波兰政府和人民向与会的各国代表团表示衷心的欢迎。
    西伦凯维兹接着说，从我们上次在莫斯科聚会以来，五个月已经过去了。我们在莫斯科通过的宣言中，对西方国家复活德国军国主义和变西德为侵略性军事集团前哨的行动，表示了明确的态度。莫斯科会议声明，如果巴黎协定获得批准，参加会议的国家就要采取具体的措施。由于美国统治集团施加压力的结果，侵略性的巴黎协定被批准了。
    在这期间，我们就我们的联合防御工作问题，特别是缔结友好、合作和互助条约的问题，以及组织我们武装部队的联合司令部问题，进一步交换了意见。
    西伦凯维兹说，这次会议面前摆着重大的任务，因为我们要讨论保障我们这些国家的安全的具体办法，以便保障欧洲和平。
    我们一方面坚决沿着保证我们的安全和独立的道路前进，一方面也不放过任何机会来争取缓和国际紧张局势，来阻止帝国主义和军国主义集团所策划的疯狂的扩充军备。因此，华沙会议有着重要的意义。
    西伦凯维兹强调说，华沙会议将在实现集体安全原则的道路上前进一大步，它将树立强大的障碍，来阻挡复活希特勒“国防军”的军国主义者、复仇主义者的侵略阴谋。
    西伦凯维兹最后祝会议获得圆满成功。
