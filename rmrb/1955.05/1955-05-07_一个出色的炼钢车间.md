　　An Outstanding Steelmaking Workshop
　　Lù Zǔlián
    The open-hearth steelmaking workshop of Tianjin Steel Plant is an outstanding steelmaking workshop. In the first four months of this year, it overfulfilled the state plan every month, and increased the production of steel ingots by more than 2,400 tons for the country.

    In recent years, the production technology level of this workshop has been continuously improved. In the first quarter of 1955, the utilization rate of open-hearth equipment in this workshop increased by 2.55 times compared with 1949. This is mainly due to the continuous reduction of open-hearth furnace repair time, the increase in production operation time, the shortening of smelting time per heat, and the increase in steel output per heat over the years. In 1949, the open-hearth furnace in this workshop had 196 days of repair time per year. According to the level of the first quarter of this year, the annual repair time is less than 30 days. In 1949, it took 10 hours and 17 minutes to refine a heat of steel, but in the first quarter of 1955, it only took 6 hours and 57 minutes; and the steel output per heat in the first quarter of 1955 was also 30 percent higher than in 1949.

    The production indicators of the Tianjin Steel Plant's open-hearth furnace should become a mirror for open-hearth workshops in various places. For example, the new open-hearth furnace of Factory 101 had a equipment utilization rate of only 66 percent of that of Tianjin Steel Plant in the first quarter of 1955. According to the level of the first quarter, the annual repair time will be three times that of Tianjin Steel Plant.

    The reason why every indicator of this advanced steelmaking workshop can be improved is due to the guidance and help of Soviet experts. In recent years, Soviet experts Malychev, Naidovsky, Rank, and Graminskov and other comrades have repeatedly come to the factory to guide steelmaking production. The experts have continuously helped this workshop establish various furnace protection and operation systems, improve labor organization, and suggested adopting advanced experiences such as "sintered hearth method", "parallel and cross operation method for furnace repair", "fast baking furnace curve", and "three-slurry bricklaying method", which greatly reduces open-hearth furnace repair time and improves furnace life. The experts also helped this workshop improve furnace design, improve smelting and pouring operations, and suggested that gas furnaces adopt the "thick coal seam operation method" to improve gas quality and continuously shorten smelting time; Soviet experts also helped this workshop produce new steel grades and improve steel quality. Recently, Tianjin Steel Plant promoted the advanced experience of the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Works in the Soviet Union in thick-layer sintering and repairing hearths. In March of this year, it created a new national record of only 43 hours for each hot repair of the hearth.

    Resolutely implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts is the source of strength for this workshop to achieve great achievements.

    This workshop has been repeatedly rated as a model workshop in Tianjin; and many heroic model figures have emerged over the years. Their resolute implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts and their spirit of selfless work have become examples for metallurgical workers.

    All workers, technicians and staff of the steelmaking workshop of Tianjin Steel Plant cherish their achievements very much. Under the leadership of the Party and with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, they are working hard to increase the production of steel ingots for the country with full confidence.

　　一个出色的炼钢车间
　　陆祖廉
    天津钢厂的平炉炼钢车间，是一个出色的炼钢车间。今年头四个月，月月超额完成国家计划，并替国家增产二千四百多吨钢锭。
    几年来，这个车间的生产技术水平不断提高。一九五五年第一季度，这个车间平炉设备利用率比一九四九年提高了二点五五倍。这主要是由于历年来平炉修炉时间不断减少，生产作业时间增加，每炉熔炼时间缩短以及每炉出钢量增加。一九四九年，这个车间的平炉，一年要有一百九十六天的修理时间，按照今年第一季度的水平，全年的修理时间还不到三十天。一九四九年炼一炉钢要十小时十七分，一九五五年第一季度只要六小时五十七分；而一九五五年第一季度每炉出钢量还比一九四九年提高了百分之三十。
    天津钢厂平炉的生产指标应该成为各地平炉车间的一面镜子。像一○一厂新建平炉，一九五五年第一季度的设备利用率只有天津钢厂的百分之六十六，按第一季度的水平，全年的修理时间将为天津钢厂的三倍。
    这个先进炼钢车间的每一项指标的所以能提高，是由于苏联专家的指导和帮助。几年来，苏联专家马雷舍夫、纳依道夫斯基、兰克、葛拉民斯可夫等同志多次到该厂指导炼钢生产。专家们不断地帮助这个车间建立各种护炉和操作制度，改进劳动组织，并建议采用“烧结炉底法”“修炉的平行交叉作业法”“快速烤炉曲线”“三浆砌砖法”等先进经验，使平炉修理时间大大减少，炉体寿命提高。专家还帮助这个车间改进炉体设计，改进熔炼和浇注操作，并建议煤气炉采用“厚煤层操作法”，提高煤气质量，使熔炼时间不断缩短；苏联专家还帮助这个车间生产新钢种并提高了钢的质量。最近天津钢厂推行苏联库兹涅兹克钢铁厂厚层烧补炉底的先进经验。今年三月份，创每次热修炉底占时四十三小时多的全国新纪录。
    坚决贯彻苏联专家的建议，是这个车间取得巨大成绩的力量源泉。
    这个车间曾多次被评为天津市的模范车间；历年来还出现了很多英雄模范人物。他们坚决贯彻苏联专家建议和忘我劳动的精神成为冶金工人的榜样。
    天津钢厂炼钢车间的全体工人、技术人员和职员，十分珍贵自己的成绩。他们在党的领导和苏联专家热诚的帮助下，满怀信心地为国家增产钢锭而努力。
