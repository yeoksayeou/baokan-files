Joint Notice on Celebrating "June 1st" International Children's Day

　　This year's "June 1st" International Children's Day is right before the World Peace Congress and the World Mother's Congress, which are being convened by people all over the world to ease international tensions, oppose atomic warfare, and strive for peace, so that children can grow up in a peaceful environment. It is also the third year of our country's first five-year construction plan. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have taken a series of concrete measures to continuously improve children's lives and improve children's education on the basis of national construction. For example, newly built and expanded maternity and child health hospitals, maternity and child health stations (posts), children's hospitals, children's health clinics, nurseries (stations), kindergartens, primary schools, children's training institutions, as well as children's newspapers and publishing houses, children's palaces, children's homes, children's libraries, juvenile science stations, children's stadiums, children's parks, children's theater troupes, children's cinemas, waiting rooms for mothers and children in stations, carriages for children, and other children's welfare and cultural facilities are being added year by year. In the vast rural areas, mass education work on new midwifery and new parenting methods has been promoted successively. Thanks to the Party's education of the masses, a new atmosphere of caring for and educating children is gradually being established in families and society. However, to educate children to become well-rounded socialist successors, all parents and all sectors of society need to cooperate with national child-rearing institutions and schools to jointly take responsibility for educating children. Parents cannot shirk their due responsibility for educating their children because the state is responsible. Therefore, first of all, parents and child care and education workers are required to establish correct views and methods of educating children, to educate children with socialist ideology, and to eliminate feudal and bourgeois views and methods of treating children.

　　Accordingly, government departments and people's organizations related to child care and education in major cities should jointly establish a "June 1st" International Children's Day Preparatory Committee to carry out the following tasks:

　　(1) Before "June 1st" International Children's Day, hold meetings of people from all walks of life who care about children in the locality (including representatives of institutions, schools, and organizations), and invite local Party and government responsible comrades or experts to make reports on the efforts and achievements made in protecting children and cultivating outstanding new generations in recent years. At the same time, conduct appropriate criticism of the old habits that still exist locally that are harmful to the healthy development of children's physical and mental health, oppose spoiling, beating, scolding, and intimidating children, and further establish a new social atmosphere of correctly caring for and educating children. It is necessary to be able to supervise and stop all phenomena of abuse and harm to children among the masses. Public outrage should be expressed against the behavior of counter-revolutionary elements, illegal capitalists, bandits, and hooligans who lure and harm children, and the courts should be requested to punish them according to law; reactionary, obscene, and absurd books and periodicals that poison children should be stopped by mobilizing broad social public opinion.

　　(2) In both urban and rural areas, under the care and guidance of the local Party and government, parents' forums or mass forums should be held in a planned manner around "June 1st" International Children's Day to exchange experiences in raising children or make special reports. According to the specific circumstances of the locality, explain new parenting knowledge, introduce and promote the use of correct methods to educate children. When necessary, family visits or individual education can be carried out with emphasis. All adults are required to set a good example for children. First of all, Communist Party members and state organ staff should improve their sense of responsibility for educating their children, thereby promoting families to cooperate with national child-rearing institutions and schools to jointly do a good job in educating and caring for children.

　　The clubs of factories, mines, enterprises, and institutions, and the cultural centers (stations) in various places should cooperate in carrying out activities centered on caring for children around "June 1st" International Children's Day, such as showing movies and slides, and holding exhibitions.

　　(3) Around "June 1st" International Children's Day, institutions that educate children should hold meetings of child education workers and child care workers in their units to study methods of educating children, exchange experiences, invite responsible comrades or experts to make reports, and commend outstanding child work units, child workers, enthusiastic social figures and parents, and publicize their advanced examples of correctly educating children, focusing on publicizing the correct education and care of children with socialist ideas, and opposing corporal punishment and disguised corporal punishment of children.

　　(4) Educators, writers, artists, scientists, medical and health workers, and publishing workers across the country are required to participate in the activities of "June 1st" International Children's Day, and in the future, better care for children's physical and mental health, create and publish more and better works for children, enrich children's spiritual lives, and at the same time, continuously create and publish works that can help parents and teachers correctly educate children.

　　(5) Newspapers, magazines, radio stations, rural propaganda networks, blackboards, and other propaganda institutions are required to publicize the need to protect children and defend peace around "June 1st" International Children's Day, in conjunction with the upcoming World Mother's Congress. Vigorously publicize the new situations and progress of children across the country in various aspects since liberation, commend exemplary deeds in children's work, and call on everyone to treat children with a correct attitude, care for children, respect children's personality, and cultivate children's good qualities of honesty, bravery, liveliness, health, and love for the motherland, the people, labor, science, and public property.

　　(6) The following points must be paid attention to when holding celebrations for children: (1) All localities should hold diverse, lively, and interesting activities suitable for the age characteristics of children on "June 1st" International Children's Day according to past experience and the specific circumstances of various places this year, so that children can spend the holiday happily and be educated. (2) School children, especially the Young Pioneers' organizations, should do their best to unite and lead out-of-school children to participate in holiday activities, and can adopt methods such as garden parties or joint celebrations between in-school and out-of-school children. (3) In order to leave a deeper holiday impression on children, responsible comrades of the Party and government, labor models, combat heroes, advanced producers, writers, scientists, etc. can be appropriately invited to meet with children. (4) All drama, music, dance, ballad, acrobatics and other literary and art groups or individuals, as well as cinemas, film projection teams, etc., are required to perform wonderful programs suitable for children during the festival. (5) Hold exhibitions of children's songs and dances, sports performances, and science and art works, hold campfire parties, and so on. (6) In cities with children from the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and other countries, they can be invited to have joint celebrations with local Chinese children. This year in Beijing, an exhibition of excellent paintings by Chinese and Soviet children will also be held. When carrying out the above celebration activities, special attention should be paid to protecting children's safety and health, and avoiding adult methods such as lengthy speeches.

　　On the basis of this year's work to commemorate "June 1st" International Children's Day, the institutions, schools, and relevant people's organizations for women and children's work that educate and care for children in various places should always pay attention to helping parents and child care and education workers to educate children with socialist ideas and cultivate children to become socialist new people.

　　关于庆祝“六一”国际儿童节的联合通知
    今年“六一”国际儿童节，正是全世界人民为缓和国际紧张局势、反对原子战争、争取和平、为使儿童在和平环境中生长而召开世界和平大会和世界母亲大会的前夕，也正是我国第一个五年建设计划的第三年度。中国共产党和人民政府在国家建设的基础上为不断改善儿童生活和改进儿童教养工作曾采取了一系列的具体措施。如新建和扩建了妇幼保健院、妇幼保健所（站）、儿童医院、儿童保健所、托儿所（站）、幼儿园、小学校、儿童教养院以及儿童的报刊和出版社、少年宫、少年之家、儿童图书馆、少年科学站、儿童体育场、儿童公园、儿童剧团、儿童电影院、车站的母子候车室、携带儿童车厢等儿童福利和文化设施，并在逐年增加。在广大的农村里，先后推行新法接生和新育儿法的群众教育工作。由于党对群众的教育，在家庭和社会上正逐渐树立起爱护儿童教育儿童的新风气。但是要把儿童教养成为全面发展的社会主义新人，需要所有的父母和社会各方面配合国家教养儿童的机关、学校，共同负起教养儿童的责任来。做父母的不能因为有国家负责而推卸自己应尽的教养子女的责任。所以首先要求父母和儿童保育、教育工作者树立起正确的教育儿童的观点和方法，以社会主义思想教育儿童，清除封建的和资产阶级的对待儿童的观点和教育方法。
    据此，各大城市的有关儿童保育教育的政府部门及人民团体应联合成立“六一”国际儿童节筹委会，进行下列各项工作：
      （一）在“六一”国际儿童节前，举行地方上各方面关怀儿童的人士（包括机关、学校、团体的代表）的集会，请当地党、政负责同志或专家作关于几年来在保卫儿童、培养优秀的新一代所做的努力和成就的报告，同时针对当地尚存在的有害于儿童身心健全发展的旧习惯，进行适当批判，反对溺爱、打骂和威吓儿童，进一步树立起正确爱护儿童、教育儿童新的社会风气，要能做到在群众中互相监督和制止一切虐待损害儿童的现象。对于反革命分子、不法资本家、盗匪、流氓诱骗和残害儿童的行为要表示公愤，并请求法院依法惩办；对于毒害儿童的反动、淫秽、荒诞的书刊，要发动广大社会舆论加以制止。
    （二）在城市和农村均应在当地党和政府的关怀和指导下，在“六一”国际儿童节前后，有计划地召开家长座谈或群众座谈，交流教养儿童的经验，或作专题报告，针对当地的具体情况，讲解新的育儿知识，介绍与提倡用正确的方法教育儿童，必要时，可有重点的进行家庭访问或个别教育。要求所有成人为儿童树立良好的榜样，首先要求共产党员和国家机关工作人员提高教育子女的责任感，从而促使家庭配合国家教养儿童的机关、学校共同做好教育儿童和保育儿童的工作。
    各厂矿企业和机关的俱乐部、各地的文化馆
  （站）在“六一”国际儿童节前后应配合进行以关怀爱护儿童为中心内容的活动，如放映电影、幻灯，举办展览会等。
      （三）各地教养儿童的机关在“六一”国际儿童节前后，应召开本单位的儿童教育工作者、儿童保育工作者的会议，研究教养儿童的方法，交流经验，请负责同志或专家做报告，并可表扬优秀的儿童工作单位、儿童工作者、热心儿童事业的社会人士以及父母，宣传他们正确教养儿童的先进事例，着重宣传以社会主义的思想正确地教育和爱护儿童，反对体罚和变相体罚儿童。
    （四）要求全国的教育家、文学家、艺术家、科学家、医药卫生工作者、出版工作者，参加“六一”国际儿童节的活动，今后更好地关怀儿童的身心健康，为儿童创作和出版更多更好的作品，丰富儿童的精神生活，同时要求源源不绝地创作和出版能帮助父母和教师正确教育儿童的作品。
      （五）要求各报刊、杂志、广播电台、农村的宣传网、黑板报等宣传机构，在“六一”国际儿童节前后，结合即将召开的世界母亲大会，宣传保卫儿童必须保卫和平。并大力宣传解放以来全国儿童在各方面的新情况和进步，表扬儿童工作中的模范事例，号召大家以正确的态度对待儿童，关怀爱护儿童，尊重儿童的人格，培养儿童诚实勇敢活泼健壮和具有爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的优良品德。
      （六）为儿童举行庆祝活动时，必须注意下列各点：（1）各地应根据过去经验及今年各地的具体情况，在“六一”国际儿童节为儿童举行多种多样而又适合儿童年龄特点的生动有趣的活动，让儿童欢度节日，并受到教育。（2）学校儿童特别是少先队的组织，要尽力团结带动校外儿童参加节日活动，可采用游园或校内外儿童联欢等方式。（3）为给儿童留下较深刻的节日印象，可适当地邀请党政负责同志，劳动模范、战斗英雄、先进生产者、作家、科学家等与儿童见面。（4）要求各戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、曲艺、杂技等文艺团体或个人以及电影院、电影放映队等在节日演出适合儿童的精彩节目。（5）举办儿童歌舞、体育表演和科学、艺术作品的展览会，举行营火会等等活动。（6）在有苏联、人民民主国家和其他国家儿童的城市，可邀请他们与当地中国儿童联欢。在北京今年并将展览中苏儿童的优秀绘画。在进行以上各项庆祝活动时，应特别注意保护儿童的安全健康，避免用成人方式如长篇演讲等。
    各地教育、保育儿童的机关、学校和有关妇女、儿童工作的人民团体，应在今年纪念“六一”国际儿童节的工作基础上，经常注意帮助父母和儿童保育、教育工作者，以社会主义的思想教育儿童，培养儿童成为社会主义的新人。
