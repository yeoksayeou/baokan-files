　　Yumen's New Butter Factory Put Into Production
    A newly built butter factory at the Yumen Mining Bureau officially went into production on May 22nd. The first batch of butter produced was of qualified quality. This batch of butter has already begun to be supplied to various units of the Yumen Oil Mine for use.

    The drilling, oil extraction, and refining plants of the Yumen Oil Mine all require a large amount of butter. In the past, these butters were supplied from other places, and delays in supply affected production. Now that this butter factory has been built, it can use light and heavy machine oil and beef and mutton tallow produced in the mine and nearby areas as raw materials to manufacture butter and supply the needs of various units in a timely manner. When production equipment is expanded in the future, it can also supply a large amount of butter to other places.

　  玉门新建黄油厂投入生产
    玉门矿务局新建的一座黄油厂，在五月二十二日正式投入生产。生产出的第一批黄油，质量合格。这批黄油已经开始供给玉门油矿各单位使用。
    玉门油矿的钻井处、采油厂和炼油厂等单位都需要大量黄油。过去这些黄油都是靠外地供应，供应不及时便影响生产。现在这座黄油厂建成以后，便可以用本矿和附近地区生产的轻、重机油和牛油、羊油做原料，制造黄油及时供应各单位需要。将来生产设备扩大以后，还可以供应外地大量黄油。
