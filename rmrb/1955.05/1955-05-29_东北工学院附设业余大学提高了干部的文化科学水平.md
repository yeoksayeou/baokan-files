　　Northeast Institute of Technology's Affiliated Amateur University Improves Cadres' Cultural and Scientific Level

　　The Northeast Institute of Technology's affiliated amateur university has improved the cultural and scientific level of a large number of in-service cadres in industrial and mining enterprises. At present, the amateur university has more than 390 undergraduate and preparatory students from 72 units in the Shenyang City machinery, electrical engineering, smelting, and construction systems, including factory directors, workshop directors, section chiefs, technicians, and general enterprise cadres.

　　When the amateur university was first established, it only had preparatory courses, mainly recruiting in-service cadres with a junior high school education or above from factories and mines to participate in learning, laying the foundation for entering undergraduate studies. Now, the amateur university has had two batches of preparatory graduates, a total of 153 people, all of whom have been promoted to undergraduate studies for further study. In their studies, the students have improved their practical work ability. Many of the main cadres of factories and mines have now learned to use trigonometry and algebra for calculations, and many have learned to use slide rules. Some students, after studying physics, understand the coefficient of friction on lathes, and some, after studying humidity, can put forward specific suggestions for dealing with the moisture content of cotton in textile factories. Many people have improved their ability to manage enterprises through their studies.

　　东北工学院附设业余大学提高了干部的文化科学水平
    东北工学院附设业余大学提高了工矿企业部门的大批在职干部的文化科学水平。目前业余大学共有本科、预科学生三百九十多名，他们来自沈阳市机械、电工、冶炼和建筑等系统七十二个单位，其中有厂长、车间主任、科长、技术员以及一般企业干部。
    业余大学在创办时只设有预科，主要吸收厂矿企业中具有初中以上文化程度的在职干部参加学习，为升入本科打下基础。现在，业余大学已经有两批预科毕业生共一百五十三人，全部升入本科深造。在学习中，学员们提高了实际工作能力。许多厂矿企业的主要干部，现在已经学会运用三角、代数来计算，有不少人学会用计算尺。有的学员在学习物理后懂得了车床上的摩擦系数，有的在学习湿度后能对处理纺织厂棉花水份问题提出具体意见。许多人在学习中提高了管理企业的能力。
