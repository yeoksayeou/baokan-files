The Huayuan County Cultural Center in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hunan Province collected local materials, took photos, and drew pictures to hold a touring exhibition. The content of this exhibition is divided into three parts. The first part shows the painful life of peasants before liberation who were ruthlessly exploited. The second part shows that although the lives of peasants improved after the land reform, due to the growth of spontaneous forces of the small-scale peasant economy, some peasants began to experience difficulties in life, to the point of selling their fields and land. The third part shows that after taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation, the production level of farmers has greatly improved, and therefore their living standards are also rising day by day. All these materials are based on real people and events in the local area and are very vivid.

From April 12 to April 28, the exhibition was held in fourteen townships, thirteen agricultural cooperatives, and four market fairs, attracting 4,952 visitors, of whom 4,242 were Miao people. During the exhibition, forms of "Sanbang Drum", Miao songs, slides, and quick reports, which are popular among the Miao people, were used to publicize the mutual aid and cooperation policies and the "Three Fixes" policy to the Miao people. Three Miao comrades were invited to give explanations. (Tang Zemin)

　　花垣县文化馆举办巡回展览会
    湖南省湘西苗族自治州花垣县文化馆收集了当地的实际材料拍成了照片和画成了画片，举办了一个巡回展览会。这个展览会的内容分为三部分。第一部分是解放前农民被压榨得痛苦不堪的生活情况；第二部分是土地改革后农民生活虽有好转，但由于小农经济自发势力的增长，又有部分农民生活开始感到困难，以至卖田卖土；第三部分是走互助合作的道路后，农民生产水平有了很大的提高，因而生活水平也在日渐上升。所有这些材料，都是当地真人真事，非常生动。
    这个展览会在四月十二日到四月二十八日止，曾在十四个乡镇、十三个农业社、四个墟场上展出，观众达四千九百五十二人，其中苗族占四千二百四十二人。在展览时使用了为苗胞所喜闻乐见的“三棒鼓”、苗歌和幻灯、快报等形式，向苗胞们宣传了互助合作政策，“三定”政策，并请了三个苗族同志讲解。　（汤泽民）
