　　North Atlantic Aggression Group Holds Council Meeting

    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 11th Dispatch from TASS on the 10th: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council began a three-day meeting in Paris on the 9th. According to Agence France-Presse, West Germany was admitted to the military bloc at the first meeting, according to the Paris Agreements.

    Foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries delivered speeches at the meeting. Under the guise of empty words about peaceful aspirations, these ministers advocated the so-called "position of strength" policy of intensifying international tensions. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said that the principles upheld by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states require building a strong defense force. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak said that negotiations should be held “from a position of strength.” The purpose of these propaganda speeches is to conceal the aggressive nature of their policies, which not only do not promote the resolution of international problems but also increase the threat of war.

    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council then held a closed meeting.

    Agence France-Presse reported that on the 9th, six West German military representatives, headed by Hans Speidel, officially joined the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.

　　北大西洋侵略集团举行理事会会议
    新华社十一日讯　据塔斯社巴黎十日讯：北大西洋公约组织理事会九日在巴黎开始举行历时三天的会议。据法新社报道，在第一次会议上，根据巴黎协定，西德被接纳进入这个军事集团。
    北大西洋公约组织各国外交部长在会议上发表了演说。这些部长们在一些关于和平愿望的空洞词句的掩饰下，鼓吹加剧国际紧张局势的所谓“从实力地位出发”的政策。美国国务卿杜勒斯说，北大西洋公约组织各成员国所坚持的原则需要建立一个强大的防御力量。比利时外交大臣斯巴克说，要
  “从实力地位出发举行谈判”。这些宣传性的演说的目的是要掩饰他们所奉行的那种不但不能促进国际问题的解决反而增加战争威胁的政策的侵略性质。
    北大西洋公约组织理事会随后举行秘密会议。
    法新社报道，九日，以汉斯·斯派达尔为首的六名西德军事代表正式参加北大西洋集团军队总司令部。
