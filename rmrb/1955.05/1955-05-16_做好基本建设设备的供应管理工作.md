Doing a good job in the supply management of basic construction equipment

Xiao Chenren, Deputy Director of the Basic Construction Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry

The supply management of equipment for basic construction is a very important task. Because equipment is the tool we use to expand reproduction, the investment required to purchase equipment accounts for about 38 to 40 percent of the total basic construction investment. If the equipment supply management work is not done well, it will directly affect the completion of basic construction tasks, the use of fixed assets, and the expanded reproduction of industrial enterprises.

In the past two years, large-scale national economic construction has just begun, and the main focus has been on concentrating efforts to solve problems in civil engineering and construction. In 1955, the situation has changed greatly. The civil engineering and construction of many units have been completed or are about to be completed, and the civil engineering and construction of new factories have only partially begun. The proportion of equipment installation projects has increased significantly. (This year's equipment installation project accounts for 51.9% of the total investment, of which equipment accounts for 49.5%.) This situation requires units with heavier equipment installation work to concentrate their main efforts on solving problems in installation engineering, especially in equipment supply management.

There are many problems in the current equipment supply management work. The main one is that many units violate the basic construction procedures to order equipment. The normal procedure should be: if the preliminary design is not available, and the equipment list is not available, it is impossible to submit an order. The items and specifications listed in the equipment list attached to the preliminary design will have many changes during the technical design. Therefore, only a part of major, complex, and long manufacturing process equipment can be ordered based on this equipment list; and this part of the equipment must be proposed by the design department and guaranteed to be adopted in the technical design. The equipment list attached to the technical design should be the basis for ordering, because it is generally not subject to change in the construction drawings. When the construction drawings are released, some equipment items often need to be added, which should be seized and ordered in time.

However, many comrades now do not follow this procedure, and often submit orders before the technical design is released, or even before the preliminary design is released. They often force the design department to "estimate" the order, or cleverly propose an order form on their own, and then submit the order after "soliciting" the opinions of the design department. They say: "If we don't do this, we won't be able to order the goods, and it will delay the basic construction." And they scare others: "Who is responsible for delaying national construction?" The designers are afraid of "delaying" the construction, so they dare not refuse to propose, but they are afraid that it will not be used, so they use "personal opinion, for reference only" to prevaricate. Some designers even propose equipment that they have found in books, magazines, and newspapers, and request orders. Ordering in this way, of course, often results in duplicate or incorrect orders. Coupled with changes in plans, tasks, and designs, a large backlog of equipment has been created. In the past few years, the value of accumulated equipment in the machinery industry system that has been determined to be purchased by the state is about 100 million yuan. In addition, more than 1,900 sets of accumulated equipment remain in various construction units, with a value of 15.72 million yuan. In fact, it generally takes half a year to a year from the release of the technical design to the completion of the construction drawings, and it generally takes one year to one and a half years from the start of civil engineering and construction to the installation of the first batch of equipment. If we order according to normal procedures, the time is sufficient and will not delay basic construction.

The second problem is that equipment often cannot be supplied in complete sets. Equipment manufactured abroad is supplied in complete sets; however, for equipment manufactured domestically, complete sets of orders were not organized according to the requirements of the entire factory in the past. A set of equipment was sought by the construction unit from different manufacturers, and the delivery dates of the manufacturers were inconsistent. As a result, the complete set of equipment was fragmented, with this missing and that lacking. In particular, non-standard equipment (i.e., equipment that is not mass-produced by the factory and needs to be designed and manufactured separately) has not been uniformly allocated for ordering as equipment complete with standard equipment. The design force in this area is also weak, and it has not been well organized, and the phenomenon of repeated design and waste of design force in various units is quite serious. The quality of the designed equipment is not good, it cannot be delivered in time or completely, and it is required to be delivered very urgently after delivery, which increases the difficulty of organizing manufacturing. And the manufacturers generally have serious phenomena of only paying attention to standard equipment and not being willing to or not paying attention to non-standard equipment. The quality of the manufactured equipment is not good, the mechanical parts and electrical parts are not complete, the cost is high, and the delivery is often delayed. Therefore, it is often the case that standard equipment arrives, but non-standard equipment does not, and the project cannot be completed and put into production on schedule.

Another problem in equipment supply management is that many people have a tendency to like new things and dislike old ones, and always try to propose new equipment, and do not pay attention to the use of original equipment. This situation is more serious in expanded and rebuilt factories. Some factories even strive to order new equipment and dismantle the old equipment that can still be used. Some deliberately underestimate the price of equipment in order to obtain more new equipment. At present, in the units under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, there are about 4,600 sets of old equipment that can be used with a little repair, or old equipment that can meet the needs of the secondary workshops of new or rebuilt factories after modification. Now they are all idle, and no one wants to choose them.

Some people only pay attention to supply, thinking that "everything is fine" when the equipment arrives, but they do not pay attention to the storage and maintenance of the equipment. As a result, phenomena such as rust, deformation, incompleteness, and incomplete information are very serious.

In order to ensure the smooth progress of the installation project, the above problems need to be solved urgently. It is necessary to quickly take the following measures:

First, adhere to the basic construction procedures. No orders are allowed if the technical design is not available. Some important equipment that needs to be ordered as soon as the preliminary design is available must be carefully studied by the design department and submitted an order form before approval is given.

Second, it is necessary to establish and strictly implement the domestic equipment complete supply system, and organize the complete supply of domestic equipment that meets the quality requirements according to the plan. The division of labor and responsibilities of construction units and manufacturing units in the design and manufacture of non-standard equipment should be clearly defined.

Third, strictly review the order plans of rebuilt and expanded factories. Any original equipment that can continue to be used is not allowed to order new equipment. For the accumulated equipment, it is necessary to set out indicators and deadlines, and formulate a disposal plan. All construction units should correct the idea of ​​not being willing to use accumulated equipment, and first consider using the currently stored accumulated equipment. In the future, if there is any accumulation of equipment again, the units themselves will be responsible for solving it, and the state will not allocate additional funds to solve the accumulated equipment.

Fourth, it is necessary to formulate and implement handling regulations, and do a good job in the transportation and handling of equipment. According to the equipment layout plan, classify the equipment, set up different warehouses to store the equipment, and conduct regular inspections, cleaning, oiling, cold protection, and moisture protection to ensure that the equipment does not rust, deform, and is complete and undamaged.

　　做好基本建设设备的供应管理工作
　　第一机械工业部基本建设司副司长  萧陈人
    基本建设的设备供应管理工作是一件很重要的工作。因为设备是我们进行扩大再生产的工具，购置设备所需要的投资约占全部基本建设投资的百分之三十八到四十。如果设备供应管理工作做得不好，将直接影响基本建设任务的完成，影响固定资产的动用和工业企业的扩大再生产。
    过去两年，国家大规模经济建设才开始，主要是集中力量解决土木建筑方面的问题。一九五五年，情况已有很大改变，很多单位的土木建筑工程已经完毕或即将完毕，新建厂的土木建筑才部分开始，设备安装工程的比重显著上升。（今年的设备安装工程占总投资的百分之五十一点九，其中设备占百分之四十九点五。）这种情况就要求设备安装工作较重的单位，必须集中主要力量去解决安装工程方面的问题，首先是设备供应管理方面的问题。
    目前设备供应管理工作中的问题很多。其中主要的是很多单位违反基本建设程序去进行设备订货。正常的程序应该是：初步设计没有出来，设备单也没有，根本不能提出订货。初步设计出来时所附的设备单中所列的项目及规格等，在进行技术设计时会有不少变动，因此只能根据这个设备单订购一部分重大、复杂、制造过程长的设备；而这部分设备必须是由设计部门提出，并保证在技术设计中加以采用的。技术设计出来时所附的设备单，一般的在施工图中不致变更了，因此应以这个设备单作为订货的根据。到施工图出来时，常常要补充一些设备项目，这些应该抓紧及时订货。
    但是，现在有许多同志却不按这个程序办事，常常在技术设计没有出来，甚至初步设计没有出来，便提出订货。他们常常逼迫设计部门“估”提订货，或自作聪明地提出订货单，“征求”设计部门的意见后便提出订货。他们说：“不这样做就订不到货，就会耽误基本建设。”并且吓唬别人：“耽误了国家建设，谁负责？”设计人员怕“耽误”建设，不敢不提，提了又怕用不上，便以“个人意见，只供参考”来搪塞。有些设计人员甚至将在书上翻到的、杂志上看到的、报纸上找到的设备提出来，要求订货。用这样的办法订货，当然常常要订重、订错。再加计划、任务和设计变更等等原因，就造成了设备大量积压的现象。几年来，已确定由国家收购的机械工业系统积压的设备，价值约为一亿元。此外留在各建设单位的积压设备还有一千九百多台，价值一千五百七十二万元。实际上，从技术设计出来到施工图完成，一般需要半年到一年时间，从土木建筑开始到安装第一批设备，一般需要一年到一年半。如果我们按照正常的程序订货，时间是足够的，是不会耽误基本建设的。
    其次一个问题是设备常常不能成套供应。国外制造的设备是成套供应的；但国内制造的设备，过去没有按照整个建厂要求来组织成套订货，一套设备由建设单位分头找承制厂，而承制厂交货期又不一，结果成套设备弄得七零八落，到了这个，缺了那个。特别是非标准设备（即不是工厂大量生产，需要单独设计、单独制造的设备），没有被当作与标准设备成套的设备来统一分配订货。这方面的设计力量也薄弱，没有很好地组织起来，没有作合理的分工，各个单位重复设计、浪费设计力量的现象相当严重。设计出来的设备质量不好，不能及时交付或交得不完整，交出来以后又要得很急，因此增加了组织制造的困难。而制造厂又普遍存在着严重的只注意标准设备，不乐意或不重视非标准设备的现象，制造出来的设备质量不好，机械部分和电气部分不成套，成本高，常常脱期交货。因此往往是标准设备到了，非标准设备没有到，工程无法按期完成投入生产。
    设备供应管理工作中的再一个问题是许多人存在着喜新厌旧的情绪，总是尽量提新设备，不重视利用原有设备。这种情况以扩建和改建厂比较严重。有的厂甚至力争订了新设备，把还能继续使用的旧设备拆掉了。有的为了取得更多的新设备，故意把设备的价格估低。现在第一机械工业部所属各单位中，只要稍加修理便能使用的旧设备，或经过改装后能合乎新厂或改建厂次要车间需要的旧设备，共约有四千六百台，现在都在闲置着，谁也不愿选用。
    还有一些人，只注意供应，以为设备到了便“万事大吉”，而不注意设备的保管保养。以致设备生锈、变形、不完整和资料残缺不全等现象十分严重。
    为了保证安装工程的顺利进行，上面这些问题都是亟待解决的。有必要迅速地采取下列的几项措施：
    第一，坚持按照基本建设程序办事。技术设计没有出来的，不准订货。有些初步设计出来便需提出订货的重要设备，必须由设计部门慎重研究，提出订货单，才予批准。
    第二，必须建立和严格执行国内设备成套供应的制度，按计划组织合乎质量要求的国内设备的成套供应。建设单位和制造单位在非标准设备的设计与制造方面的分工及各应负的责任，应作明确规定。
    第三，严格审查改建和扩建厂的订货计划，凡是原有设备能够继续使用的，一律不准订购新的设备。现在积压的设备，要订出指标和期限，订出处理计划。各建设单位要纠正不肯使用积压设备的思想，首先考虑采用现在库存积压的设备。今后如再发生积压设备的情形，一概由各单位自己解决，国家不能为解决积压设备另拨资金。
    第四，要拟订和贯彻搬运规程，做好设备的运输和搬运工作。要按照设备平面布置图，分清类别，设立不同的仓库保管设备，定期进行检查、擦洗、敷油及防寒、防潮等工作，保证设备不生锈，不变形，完整无损。
