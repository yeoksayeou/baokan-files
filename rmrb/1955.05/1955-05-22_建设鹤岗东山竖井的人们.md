The People Building the Dongshan Vertical Shaft in Hegang

To the Editor:

The Hegang Dongshan Vertical Shaft is a key project aided by the Soviet Union in our country's construction. This is a massive and highly automated, mechanized mine. Here, the entire production process, from coal mining, transportation, and coal preparation, to loading the coal onto trains, will be automated and mechanized. It will produce thousands of tons of high-quality industrial coal for the country every day. Workers can quickly reach the bottom of the shaft, more than two hundred meters deep, in safe and comfortable mine cages, and then take underground electric locomotives directly to workplaces distributed along roadways that stretch over twenty miles. To prevent coal dust from flying, each coal mining face in the mine is equipped with a water spray device; workers receive three cubic meters of fresh air per person per minute, just like working in a factory. The mine is equipped with facilities such as canteens, medical clinics, and various safety devices such as fire doors, waterproof doors, fireproof train depots, and rock dust shelters to prevent methane explosions. After finishing work each day, miners can come up from the mine, take a bath in the welfare building's bathhouse, receive nutritious health food in the health room, and even go to the sunlamp room to get sun exposure to compensate for the lack of sunlight while working underground.

In October 1950, the people building the vertical shaft broke ground on the east side slope of Dongshan, digging the first shovel of earth. After more than four years of hard work, this mine is nearing completion and can be handed over to production after trial transportation in July of this year. This vertical shaft was built under extremely difficult conditions. The Dongshan Vertical Shaft is located in a rock layer with variable geological conditions, with many "faults" and large "drops," often requiring the excavation of many roadways to find a single coal seam. When encountering "soft rock layers" and "fractured zones," the rock would collapse from the top like sand; when encountering "hard rock layers," even the sharpest alloy drill bits would need to be replaced several times to drill a single hole. However, the heroes building the vertical shaft overcame various difficulties with strong will, enthusiastic labor, and collective wisdom.

Labor model and Communist Party member Sun Yonggang is one of the thousands of mining heroes. He was originally the leader of a tunneling team at the Jiaohe Mining Construction Company. This team had made contributions in the construction of the "New Three" inclined shaft in Jiaohe and the "Ten Pits" in Yingcheng. After arriving at the Dongshan Vertical Shaft, the name of Sun Yonggang and his team was always closely linked to overcoming difficulties and excellently completing tasks. While they were responsible for the excavation of the main shaft downhill and the connection roadway of the bottom yard of the shaft, they suddenly encountered a "water layer" one day. Water gushed out from the fractured roof holes, and the entire roadway became a muddy river in a short time. To ensure the safety of the mine, they fought the mud and water selflessly, sending mud and water out in mine cars. However, the water flow was very strong. In an emergency, the workers came up with a way to block the opening. They carried a large piece of wood six or seven feet long, sharpened one end, and inserted it into the water outlet, finally blocking the water eye. Then, they continued to transport the slurry, and after a whole day of fighting, they restored the roadway to normal operation. In March 1954, experts suggested that the north inclined shaft and the main vertical shaft roadway should be connected ahead of schedule. It was a daunting task to excavate more than ten meters in two days. In order not to affect the transportation of the vertical shaft, Sun Yonggang and the comrades of his team made a guarantee to the Party branch secretary: "We will not go above ground until the task is completed." The rock was so hard that sparks flew and rock dust flew like a thick fog when the drill bits were applied, making it almost impossible to see people on the other side. The deafening sound of electric drills and pneumatic picks resounded throughout the roadway, making it impossible to hear each other speak. They finally completed the task assigned by their superiors on schedule. During the Red May competition this year, they completed the excavation of the underground material yard twelve days ahead of schedule. In this way, Sun Yonggang made three major contributions in mine construction, and he himself could not even remember the number of minor contributions and awards he had received.

There are many such mining heroes in the Dongshan Vertical Shaft. When installing the main shaft ducts, beams, and loading equipment, the Zhang Guoying team operated on a small hanging platform in the shaft, one hundred seventy or eighty meters deep underground. Water flowing down from the shaft wall washed over everyone's body like rain. Large beams weighing seven or eight hundred pounds were sent down from above by cranes, and three or four people held them to install them into the beam nests. After the beams were installed into the beam nests, concrete was poured. Because the space was very small, it was not possible to compact the concrete with shovels, so the workers grabbed the concrete with their hands and filled and compacted it. Their hands were burned with blisters by the cement, but no one uttered a word of "bitterness." Although the conditions were so difficult, with the help of technicians, they improved labor efficiency by more than two times and completed the installation task ahead of schedule.

The winter in Hegang is particularly cold, with temperatures often dropping to twenty-six or twenty-seven degrees below zero. When digging the foundation, the ground was frozen harder than stone. After the frozen layer was dug open, water emerged from underground, and workers had to work in knee-deep mud and water. Workers working at high altitudes worked in the biting northwest wind. But the workers, with the help of Soviet experts, not only overcame the severe cold but also created new records in construction efficiency.

The technical personnel here also, like the workers, demonstrated a high degree of responsibility and initiative. Li Changcheng, a young technician who had only recently graduated from school, saw that workers were frequently experiencing rework and shutdowns when installing the shaft because the structure was complex and they had not done it before. He often stayed in the mine to guide the workers in their operations and used methods such as drawing and explaining to help the workers understand the structure of the shaft installation. The workers worked in three shifts, but there was only one technician, so he had to go down the mine with each shift. Sometimes, after coming up from the mine late at night, he would lie down on the office desk and sleep in his wet cotton pants and jacket. Thanks to his patient help and the active efforts of the workers, they created the "multi-vertical line" measurement method, which doubled installation efficiency and allowed the project to be completed three days ahead of schedule. Zhu Yunhua, a mining technician, put a lot of effort into proposing a rationalization proposal to relocate the fireproof train depot to unused abandoned roadways. After approval from higher authorities, it saved the country more than 60,000 yuan in wealth and also enabled the project to be completed two months ahead of schedule.

I am deeply moved by the workers' socialist creative labor enthusiasm. I sincerely pay tribute to those who are fighting tenaciously to build socialism. Yuan Guilin

### 建设鹤岗东山竖井的人们

    建设鹤岗东山竖井的人们编辑同志：
    鹤岗东山竖井是苏联帮助我国建设的一项重点工程。这是一座规模巨大而高度自动化、机械化的矿井。这里从采煤、运输、选煤，一直到把煤装上火车，全部生产过程都将是自动化和机械化的，每天它将为国家生产数千吨质地优良的工业用煤。工人们坐上安全舒适的井筒篱笼很快就可以到达二百多公尺深的井底，再坐井下电机车就可以直接到达分布在二十多里长的大小巷道上的工作场所。为了不使煤尘飞扬，在井下每个采煤工作面都安有喷水装置；工人们就像在工厂里工作一样，每分钟每个人可以得到三立方公尺的新鲜空气。井下设有食堂、医疗所等设备和防火门、防水门、防火列车库和防止瓦斯爆炸的岩粉棚等各种安全装置。矿工每天工作完了，从井下上来，可以到福利大楼的浴池去洗澡，到保健室去领取富有营养的保健食品，而且还可以到太阳灯室去照太阳灯，以弥补在井下工作没受到阳光的损害。
    一九五○年十月，建设竖井的人们在东山侧坡上挖开了竖井的第一锹土，经过四年多辛勤劳动，这座矿井已经接近完工，待今年七月试运输后就可以移交生产。这座竖井是在极端困难的条件下建设起来的。东山竖井处在地质情况多变的岩层里，“断层”多，“落差”大，往往为了寻找一层煤就要开凿很多巷道。遇到“软岩层”、“破碎带”，岩石就像沙土一样哗哗的从顶上冒落下来；碰到“硬岩层”，要打一个眼，就是用最锋利的合金钻头也得换上好几个。但是，建设竖井的英雄们用顽强的意志，热情的劳动，集体的智慧，终于战胜了各种困难。
    劳动模范、共产党员孙永刚就是千百个建井英雄中的一个。他原是蛟河建井公司的掘进工小组长，这个小组在建设蛟河“新三”斜井和营城“十坑”中曾经立了功。来到了东山竖井以后，孙永刚和他小组的名字又总是和克服困难出色地完成任务紧紧地连在一起。在他们担当竖井主井下山和井底车场贯通巷道的掘进中，一天突然遇到了“水层”，水从破碎的顶板窟窿里汹涌地喷出来，不一会全巷道变成了泥河。为了保证矿井的安全，他们奋不顾身地同泥水搏斗，用矿车往外送泥水。但是，水势很大。在紧急的情况下，工人们想出了堵口的办法，他们抬来一根六、七尺长的大木头，把一头削尖，朝着喷水口插进去，终于把水眼堵住了。接着，他们继续运出稀泥，经过整天的战斗才恢复了巷道的正常作业。一九五四年三月，专家建议北斜井和竖井大巷要提前贯通。两天内要掘进十多公尺，任务是艰巨的。为了不影响竖井的运输，孙永刚和他那个小组的同志，向党支部书记提出了保证：“不完成任务，就不上井。”岩石是那样的坚硬，钎子钻上去，火星乱冒，岩粉飞扬，像浓雾一样，几乎对面看不见人，震耳的电钻声、风镐声，响彻了全巷道，说话的声音根本听不见。他们终于按期完成了上级交给的任务。今年红五月竞赛中，他们又提前十二天完成井下材料车场子的掘进任务。就这样，孙永刚在建井中先后立了三次大功，至于小功和受奖的次数，连他自己也记不清。
    像这样的建井英雄，在东山竖井是很多的。张国英小组在安装主井贯道、贯梁和装载设备时，在井下一百七、八十公尺深的井筒小吊盘上操作。从井壁流下来的水像下雨似的，冲洗着每个人的全身。七、八百斤重的大贯梁，从井上用吊车送下来，三四个人抱着往梁窝里安装。贯梁安进梁窝后，接着是浇灌混凝土。因为空间很小，用锹捣不实，工人就用手抓混凝土往里填和捣固。他们的手都被水泥烧出了泡，可是没有一个人叫出一个
  “苦”字来。虽然条件这样困难，可是他们在技术员的帮助下，提高了劳动效率二倍以上，提前完成了安装任务。
    鹤岗的冬天特别寒冷，气温经常在零下二十六、七度。挖基础时，地面冻得比石头还硬，当冻结层挖开以后，地下又冒出水来，工人就要在没膝盖深的泥水里工作。高空作业的工人在刺骨的西北风中工作。但工人们在苏联专家帮助下不但战胜了严寒，而且在施工效率上创造了新纪录。
    这里的技术人员也和工人一样，发挥了高度的责任感和积极性。才从学校出来不久的青年技术员李长成，见到工人们在进行井筒安装的时候，因为结构复杂，没有干过而经常发生返工、停工现象。他就经常呆在井下指导工人操作，并且用画图讲解等办法来使工人懂得井筒安装的结构。工人们是三班轮换，技术员就只他一个人，因此他几乎都要随着每个班下井。有时深夜从井下上来，就穿着他那湿透了的棉裤、棉袄，躺在办公室的桌上睡。由于他的耐心帮助和工人们的积极努力，创造了“多垂线”测法，提高安装效率一倍，使工程提前三天完成计划。矿务技术员朱允华花费了很多心血，提出了一项把防火列车库迁移到不用的废巷道里去的合理化建议。经上级批准执行，为国家节约了六万多元的财富，同时使该项工程提前二个月完成计划。
    我深深地为工人们的社会主义的创造性的劳动热情所感动。我衷心地向那些顽强战斗的建设社会主义的人们致敬。　袁桂林
