The Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory Admits to Error of Deceiving Customers

Letter from Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory: The reader's "Questioning the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory" published in the People's Daily on March 27th is correct. The exposure of this issue not only reveals that our factory has capitalist management ideas and styles in its sales work, but also exposes serious problems in the quality of our products and in the education of our cadres.

When Zou Zhongsun, deputy section chief of our factory's technical inspection section, discussed the contract with the representative of Qianshanhong Farm, Zou Zhongsun adopted boasting and deceptive means, exaggerating the quality of the products without any basis. He even signed on the contract that "each gas engine guarantees to drive three 14-inch water pumps (produced by the Guangdong factory), otherwise we will be responsible for all production losses," etc. The 70-horsepower gas engine was produced by the Jiangxi Provincial Machinery Factory (the predecessor of our factory) in 1952. Due to the limitations of technical conditions and equipment at that time, the quality was not high enough, and even a 70-horsepower gas engine with very good quality would have difficulty in dragging three 14-inch water pumps.

Before signing the contract, Zou Zhongsun telephoned the factory to inform us of the contract content. After we discovered this problem, we immediately notified Zou Zhongsun by telegram that it could not be signed in this way, but when Zou Zhongsun received the telegram, the contract had already been signed. Our factory then proposed to Qianshanhong Farm the opinion of amending the contract, and the representatives of both parties negotiated and terminated the contract in January of this year.

The occurrence of this incident not only seriously affected the production tasks of Qianshanhong Farm, but also undermined the seriousness of the contract and the cooperative relationship within the enterprise. This loss is very large. In addition to conducting a review and expressing our apologies to the customer, we also suggest that the Fourth Machine Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry give Zou Zhongsun (who has been transferred to work there) appropriate punishment.

### 南昌柴油机厂承认欺骗顾主的错误

　　南昌柴油机厂承认欺骗顾主的错误
　　南昌柴油机厂来信：三月二十七日，人民日报发表的读者“责问南昌柴油机厂”是正确的。这一问题的揭发，不仅暴露了我厂在销售工作上有着资本主义经营思想和经营作风，同时也暴露了我厂产品质量上，以及对干部的教育上都存在着严重的问题。
　　我厂技术检查科副科长邹仲荪和千山红农场代表商订合同时，邹仲荪采取吹嘘、欺骗手段，毫无根据地夸大产品的质量。甚至在合同上签注“每台煤气机保证带动三台十四吋的水泵（广东厂出厂），否则由我们负生产上一切损失之责”，等等。七十马力煤气机系江西省机器厂（我厂前身）一九五二年出品。因当时技术条件和设备的限制，质量是不够高的，即使是质量很好的七十马力煤气机，要拖动三台十四吋水泵也是有困难的。
    在签订合同前，邹仲荪曾将合同内容打电话到厂。我们发现这一问题后，即用电报通知邹仲荪不能这样签订，但当邹仲荪接到电报时，合同已经签妥。我厂又向千山红农场提出修正合同的意见，今年一月双方代表协商解除了合同。
    这一事件的发生，不但严重影响了千山红农场的生产任务，同时破坏了合同的严肃性，以及企业内部的协作关系，这个损失是很大的。我们除进行检讨和向顾主表示歉意外，并建议第一机械工业部第四机器工业管理局对邹仲荪（邹已调那里工作）给以适当的处分。
