　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 26th (TASS dispatch): May 25th was the last day of the three-week British election campaign. Early in the morning of the 26th, voting will begin in six hundred and thirty constituencies.
　　A total of one thousand four hundred and ten candidates from various parties are participating in the election, including six hundred and twenty-four candidates nominated by the ruling Conservative Party, and six hundred and twenty candidates nominated by the Labour Party. The Communist Party has nominated seventeen candidates, and the Liberal Party has nominated one hundred and eleven candidates.
　　Leaders of various parties delivered speeches at mass rallies in the final days of the campaign. In a speech in Manchester, Eden denied that the Conservative Party was only using the issue of the Four-Power talks for the sake of the election. He said, "I believe that in recent months there may be important opportunities to hold international talks and conferences of various kinds."
　　Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler also said in a speech in Nottingham, "The planned summit talks with Russia are not related in time to the British general election."
　　These remarks by Conservative leaders confirm that the slogan of talks, which is welcomed by the British people, occupies an important place in their election campaign. The United Press International correspondent in London pointed out that the slogan of talks is "the Conservative Party's main trump card in the election campaign."

　　英议会选举于二十六日举行
    新华社二十六日讯　据塔斯社伦敦二十六日讯：五月二十五日是延续三周的英国竞选运动的最后一天。二十六日一清早，六百三十个选区将开始投票。
    参加竞选的各党派一共提出了一千四百一十名候选人，其中六百二十四名候选人是由现在执政的保守党提出的，六百二十名候选人由工党提出。共产党提出十七名候选人，自由党提出一百一十一名候选人。
    各党派领导人在竞选运动的最后几天在群众大会上发表演说。艾登在曼彻斯特发表的演说中，否认保守党只是为了竞选才利用四国会谈的问题。他说，“我认为，最近几个月可能有重要的机会举行各种方式的国际会谈和会议。”
    财政大臣巴特勒在诺丁汉发表演说时也说，“计划同俄国举行的最高级的会谈在时间方面同英国的普选没有关系。”
    保守党领导人们的这些言论证实：英国人民所欢迎的关于会谈的口号，在他们的竞选运动中占有重要的地位。合众社驻伦敦记者指出，会谈这个口号是“保守党在竞选运动中的主要王牌”。
