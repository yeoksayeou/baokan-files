The Korean people, having achieved a glorious victory in the righteous Fatherland Liberation War, are faced with the task of further strengthening the political, economic, and military might of the revolutionary democratic base, the northern half of the Republic—the material foundation for a unified fatherland.

This task is the only correct policy formulated by the Korean Workers' Party in a situation where the Korean armistice does not mean complete peace, our fatherland is not yet unified, and the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique are still preparing to launch a war in South Korea. This is the current course.

In Korea, the struggle to strengthen the revolutionary democratic base, in accordance with the laws of social development, and on the basis of fundamentally completing the first stage of the people's democratic revolution, presents us with the tasks of the second stage: namely, embarking on socialist construction in the northern half of our country.

The documents of the Sixth Central Committee Plenary Session of the Korean Workers' Party held after the war, and the subsequent plenary sessions, specifically define the program for socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic.

The basic direction of industrial recovery after the war, as put forward by the Korean Workers' Party, has been embodied and effectively implemented in the 1954-1956 Three-Year Plan for the Rehabilitation and Development of the National Economy; at the same time, it will be further developed in our country's first Five-Year Plan for industrialization. In 1956, the final year of the Three-Year Plan, our industrial output will reach 1.5 times that of 1949, the production of the means of production will reach 1.3 times, and the production of daily necessities will reach twice the amount.

The Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government's policy on carrying out socialist construction in the northern half of our country has received the active support of millions of working people in our country. The enormous scale and broad prospects of post-war construction are inspiring them to new victories.

Throughout all enterprises, institutions, and construction sites in the Republic after the war, a fervent competition for increased production and frugality has been launched. Now, all production departments and all workers affiliated with the General Federation of Trade Unions are participating in this movement. At the beginning of this year, the number of workers participating in the production competition increased by 43.3 percent compared to the initial period of the armistice.

The workers participating in the competition contribute all their creativity and energy to improving labor efficiency, mobilizing the reserves and potential of production, launching mass movements to learn advanced technology and operational methods, saving materials, raw materials, and finances, improving product quality, completing or over-fulfilling state plans, and accelerating the speed of recovery and construction.

The entire process of post-war construction proves that the working people have inexhaustible and great creativity. Among our country's heroic working class, there are many production innovators and advanced workers who have made special contributions during the post-war construction period.

They constantly tap the potential in production, skillfully utilize various technologies, and organize their labor in new ways. They break through old production quotas with new technologies and operational methods, create new production quotas and technical standards, and play the role of advanced workers in accelerating production and improving labor productivity.

Our country's working class continuously absorbs the advanced working methods of the Soviet Union and extensively carries out rationalization proposals and innovation movements. The mass movement launched by the working class to strive for higher production efficiency has significantly accelerated the speed of our country's post-war construction and recovery efforts.

Construction workers and military and government personnel, students, and citizens participating in the recovery and construction of the heroic city of Pyongyang completed a vast construction project in welcoming the ninth anniversary of the "August 15th" Liberation Memorial Day. They achieved tremendous construction achievements unprecedented in our country's history in the construction of Stalin Avenue, People's Army Street, Kim Il-sung University, Moranbong Theater, cultural and educational facilities, and housing. Our country's working class has won glorious honors for itself with their selfless spirit of labor. During the post-war period alone, more than 60,000 model workers emerged within the ranks of the working class, more than 20,000 were listed on the Roll of Honor, more than 7,000 received medals, and more than 10,000 received state orders and medals. Within the ranks of our country's working class, there are sixty Labor Heroes and Republic Heroes, thirty of whom emerged during the post-war construction process.

Thanks to the dedicated struggle of the laborers and the fraternal assistance of the people of brotherly countries, we overfulfilled the task of the first year of the Three-Year Plan – 1954. We completed 110 percent of the planned gross industrial output of the important sectors of our country's economy, an increase of 76 percent compared to 1953, and exceeding the pre-war 1949 level by 3 percent.

The brilliant achievements made in implementing the 1954 People's Economic Plan confirm that it is possible to greatly shorten the time to complete the post-war rehabilitation and construction of the people's economy and the tasks stipulated in the Three-Year Plan.

Based on the inexhaustible creativity of the working people and the economic and technological assistance of fraternal countries, the Party and the government have decided on a new 1955 plan: this plan will not only complete the 1955 plan stipulated in the Three-Year Plan, but also reach the level that some sectors of the national economy should reach in 1956.

Although our tasks are vast and arduous, the political awareness and labor enthusiasm of the working class are even greater. The mass production increase movement to complete the 1955 plan one to three or four months ahead of schedule and to shorten the three-year plan to two and a half years is being widely carried out everywhere, and the plan for the first quarter of 1955 has already been overfulfilled in the entire industrial sector.

Today, the Korean working class has launched a mass competition movement to greet the great festival of the working people of the world – "May Day" International Labor Day – and the tenth anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation of the Korean people due to the victory of the great Soviet army with brilliant production increase achievements.

The Korean working class, like the victories achieved in the pre-war peaceful construction and in the Fatherland Liberation War, will also achieve brilliant achievements in the post-war economic construction cause. This is inevitable. Because we have the leadership of the Workers' Party, which is armed with Marxism-Leninism and represents the interests of the entire Korean people, the political and moral unity of the broad masses of the people based on the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the Party, the creativity of millions of working people, and the continued economic and technical assistance from fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and China.

The Korean working class, holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism of Lenin and Stalin, must strengthen our democratic base by victoriously carrying out socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic, strive for the peaceful unification and independence of the fatherland, and move towards the road of prosperity and strength.

　　在战后恢复建设事业中的朝鲜工人阶级
　　朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长　金翊善
    在正义的祖国解放战争中获得光辉胜利的朝鲜人民面前，提出了进一步加强革命的民主根据地共和国北半部——统一祖国的物质基础——的政治、经济、军事力量的任务。
    这个任务是朝鲜劳动党在朝鲜停战并非意味着完全的和平、我们祖国还没有统一、美国和李承晚匪帮还在南朝鲜准备发动战争的情况下拟订的唯一正确的政策，也就是目前的路线。
    在朝鲜，为加强革命的民主基地的斗争，根据社会发展的规律，在基本上完成人民民主革命第一阶段的基础上，向我们提出了第二阶段的任务：即在我国北半部着手进行社会主义建设的任务。
    在战后所召开的朝鲜劳动党第六次中央委员会全体会议及以后几次全会的各项文件，是具体地规定共和国北半部的社会主义建设任务的纲领。
    朝鲜劳动党所提出的在战后恢复工业的基本方向，已在一九五四—一九五六年的恢复发展人民经济三年计划中具体化并卓有成效地执行了；同时，将在我国工业化的第一个五年计划当中进一步地向前发展。三年计划的最后一年即一九五六年，我国工业产量将达到一九四九年的一点五倍，生产资料的生产将达到一点三倍，日用品的生产将达到二倍。
    朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府关于在我国北半部进行社会主义建设的政策，受到了数以百万计的我国劳动人民的积极支持。战后建设的巨大规模和广阔的远景鼓舞着他们走向新的胜利。
    战后在共和国的所有企业机关中和建设工地上，都热烈地展开增加生产和节约的竞赛。如今所有的生产部门和职业总同盟所属的全部工人都参加了这个运动。今年年初参加生产竞赛的工人比停战初期增加了百分之四十三点三。
    参加竞赛的工人把自己的全部创造力和精力贡献于提高劳动效率，动员生产的后备力量和潜力，展开学习先进技术和操作法的群众性运动，资材、原料和财政上的节约，提高产品质量，完成或超额完成国家计划，加速恢复建设速度等各方面。
    战后建设的全部过程证明，劳动人民有着无穷尽的伟大的创造性。在我国英雄的工人阶级中，有着在战后建设时期建立特殊功勋的许多生产革新者和先进工作者。
    他们不断地发掘生产中的潜力，熟练地运用各种技术，以新的方法组织自己的劳动。以新的技术和操作法突破旧的生产定额，创造新的生产定额和技术水平，在加速生产和提高劳动生产效率的工作中起着先进工作者的作用。
    我国的工人阶级不断地吸取苏联的先进工作方法，广泛地展开合理化建议和革新运动。工人阶级为争取更高的生产效力所展开的群众性运动显著地加速了我国的战后建设和恢复事业的速度。
    建筑工人和参加恢复建设英雄城市平壤的军政人员、学生以及市民们，在迎接“八·一五”解放九周年纪念日之际，完成了庞大的建设工程，他们在建设斯大林大路、人民军大街、金日成大学、牡丹峰剧场、文化教育设施以及住宅的事业中，获得了我们国家历来未有的巨大的建设成就。我们祖国的工人阶级以忘我的劳动精神为自己获得了光辉的荣誉。就在战后工人阶级队伍里产生了六万多名模范工人，两万多名登上了光荣榜，七千多名获得了奖章，一万多名获得了国家的勋章和奖章。在我们祖国工人阶级的队伍里，有六十名劳动英雄和共和国英雄，其中三十名是在战后建设过程中出现的。
    由于劳动者们的献身斗争和兄弟国家人民的友谊的援助，我们超额完成了三年计划第一年度——一九五四年的任务。我们完成了我们国家经济的重要部门的工业总产值计划的百分之一百一十，比一九五三年增加了百分之七十六，超过战前一九四九年水平百分之三。
    在执行一九五四年人民经济计划中所取得的辉煌成就，证实了可以大大缩短时间完成战后人民经济恢复建设工作和三年计划所规定的任务。
    党和政府根据劳动人民的无穷无尽的创造力和兄弟国家的经济和技术上的援助，决定了新的一九五五年计划：这一计划不仅要完成三年计划中所规定的一九五五年的计划，而且国民经济中的一些部门还要达到一九五六年应达到的水平。
    虽然我们的任务庞大而艰巨，但工人阶级的政治觉悟和劳动热情却更巨大。为提前一个月至三、四个月完成一九五五年的计划而把三年计划缩短到两年半完成的这一群众性增产运动正在各地广泛地进行着，而一九五五年第一季度计划已在整个产业部门中超额完成了。
    今天朝鲜的工人阶级已掀起了群众性的竞赛运动，用光辉的增产成就来迎接全世界劳动人民的伟大节日——“五一”国际劳动节，迎接由于伟大的苏联军队的胜利而使朝鲜人民获得解放的“八·一五”十周年纪念日。
    朝鲜工人阶级和在战前的和平建设中、在祖国解放战争中所取得的胜利一样，在战后经济建设事业中也将取得光辉的成就。这是必然如此的。因为我们有以马克思列宁主义所武装起来的、代表全朝鲜人民利益的劳动党的领导，有在党的领导下以工农联盟为基础的、广泛的人民群众的政治上和道德上的统一，有数以百万计的劳动人民的创造，以及以苏联、中国为首的各兄弟国家的继续不断的经济和技术上的援助。
    朝鲜工人阶级高举着列宁斯大林的无产阶级国际主义旗帜，必须以胜利进行共和国北半部的社会主义建设来加强我们的民主基地，争取祖国的和平统一和独立，走向繁荣富强的道路。
