Since the signing of the Geneva Accords, it has been almost ten months. During this period, the Indochina War, which lasted for eight years, has ceased.

According to the agreement between Vietnam and France, by May 16, all the forces of the French Union had completely left their last stationed area in North Vietnam, the Haiphong area, and the Vietnamese People's Army had also completely withdrawn from the Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh areas of central Vietnam. The northern part of Vietnam north of the temporary military demarcation line near the 17th parallel has now been completely liberated. The Geneva Accords concerning the ceasefire, the division of the temporary military demarcation line, the assembly and transfer of troops, etc., have been basically implemented. The main issue now is to continue to resolutely implement the spirit and terms of the Geneva Accords, consolidate peace in Vietnam, prevent the recurrence of war, guarantee the democratic and free rights of the people, and realize universal suffrage to complete the unification and independence of Vietnam. In addition, some clauses stipulated in the ceasefire agreement, such as the release of all prisoners of war and detained civilians, have become outstanding issues due to the French military authorities' failure to fully implement them, and need to be resolved.

In the past nine months or so, due to the United States' attempts to obstruct and undermine the implementation of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and the relevant clauses of the Geneva Accords regarding the prevention of the recurrence of war, the guarantee of the people's democratic and free rights, and the holding of universal elections, have been seriously hindered; moreover, the implementation of the clauses on the cessation of hostilities has also been affected.

The different attitudes towards the Geneva Accords can be seen from the recent handover of the Haiphong area and the Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh areas.

	During the first phase of the handover in the Haiphong area, the French military authorities wantonly looted and destroyed public property before withdrawing. This blatant violation of the agreement by the French military in looting and destroying property was carried out under the direction and direct participation of American imperialism. To speed up the looting of public property and the people in the Haiphong area, former U.S. Presidential Envoy Collins personally went there to supervise the process. American officers in Haiphong openly went to various enterprises and schools to loot public property in the name of retrieving "U.S. aid materials."

In stark contrast to the above facts is the Vietnamese People's Army's consistent and thorough implementation of the spirit and actions of the agreement. The Vietnamese People's Army withdrew from the Ham Tan and Ca Mau areas in South Vietnam and Central Vietnam as scheduled or ahead of schedule, strictly protecting the democratic and free rights of the local people and the local public property. When withdrawing ahead of schedule from its last temporary garrison in South Vietnam—the Ca Mau Cape—the Vietnamese People's Army not only completely handed over all kinds of public property and archives in the area, but also handed over all newly built hospitals, schools, and other public facilities added during the assembly. The Vietnamese People's Army showed the same spirit in the first phase of the handover work in the Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh areas. When Ca Mau area was handed over, even the representatives of the French side admitted that "the situation was good."

The Geneva Conference, based on the different situations of the three countries of Indochina, separately stipulated the specific methods and steps for each country to achieve unification and independence. In Vietnam, free universal elections should be held within July 1956 to achieve national unification. The Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference also stipulated that the two sides should begin consultations from July 20, 1955, to discuss the issue of universal elections next year.

However, restoring peace and unifying Vietnam is inconsistent with the war policy of American imperialism, and inconsistent with its deliberate attempt to turn Indochina into its colony and military base. Therefore, American imperialism has been stepping up its sabotage activities.

The sabotage activities carried out by American imperialists in Vietnam can be summarized into the following three main aspects: First, stepping up the implementation of the Collins Plan, strengthening military control over South Vietnam, and turning South Vietnam into an American military base. Second, trying its best to support and strengthen the terrorist rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem group, infringing on the democratic and free rights of the people, and retaliating against and killing patriotic people who participated in the war of resistance. Third, not hesitating to adopt all kinds of despicable and vicious means to disturb the North Vietnamese region under the jurisdiction of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, disrupting the local people's peaceful and tranquil life, and looting manpower and material resources.

From the ceasefire to January of this year, more than 2,300 incidents of killing and retaliation against people have occurred in the French-garrisoned areas south of the 17th parallel, with a total of more than 800 people killed, more than 3,700 injured, and 13,000 arrested. The Ngo Dinh Diem group also suppressed the people's peaceful movement in Saigon, Cholon in South Vietnam, and Hue in Central Vietnam, and arrested peace advocates who supported the Geneva Accords.

American imperialism constantly interferes in the internal affairs of South Vietnam, supports Ngo Dinh Diem, and strengthens the direct control of the United States over South Vietnam through this puppet, undermining the Geneva Accords. The United States decided to use 200 to 300 million U.S. dollars annually to strengthen the South Vietnamese army, seized the power to control and directly train the South Vietnamese army from France. On the one hand, it helped Ngo Dinh Diem establish direct line armies. American military advisors have infiltrated the General Staff of the South Vietnamese Army, American officers are issuing orders in some military schools and armies, and American agents are directly commanding members of the Ngo Dinh Diem group to use terrorist means to suppress and massacre the people. On the other hand, the United States has also instructed and supported Ngo Dinh Diem to annex the armies of various sects in South Vietnam, and to eliminate pro-French forces and all dissidents. Recently, the infighting between Ngo Dinh Diem and the armies of various sects was caused by this interference policy of the United States. The chaotic situation in South Vietnam has caused the deaths, injuries and ruin of tens of thousands of people.

American imperialism extremely hates the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and fears the lofty prestige of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam among the people of the entire Vietnam and Indochina. The existence and development of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is an insurmountable obstacle to American imperialism's conspiracy to turn Vietnam and the entire Indochina into its colony and military base. American imperialism and its followers, the French colonialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem group, have always regarded weakening and undermining the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as one of their main goals. The most prominent incident they created for this goal was the large-scale looting of North Vietnamese residents.

From the beginning of the ceasefire, the American and French imperialists had been planning this conspiracy. They sent special agents and pawns north of the 17th parallel, dressed in religious cloaks, threatened the people with war and atomic bombs, and used various methods to deceive and force the people to migrate to the south.

Many news reports have covered their unspeakable crimes of looting people. The United States dispatched an entire fleet to Haiphong to loot people, and the French side used military administrative power to threaten people to relocate. French troops and Ngo Dinh Diem's men even sent planes to bomb or set fire to entire villages, forcing the residents of those villages to migrate to the south. The people in the French military's temporary assembly areas have completely lost their freedom of choice of residence according to Article 14(d) of the Geneva Accords and Item 8 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference.

At the same time, the American and French imperialists have also been deliberately coercing people in the Catholic-populated areas of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to go to South Vietnam. They sent out a large number of special agents and even organized armed disturbances to disrupt local production and land reform movements. French troops also dispatched planes and warships to invade the airspace and territorial waters of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, creating a tense atmosphere in some coastal areas to cooperate with the special agents' war propaganda and intimidate the people to go to South Vietnam. The French side's false accusation to the International Commission that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was "obstructing" people from migrating south was precisely to cover up its own criminal activities that violated the ceasefire agreement. People's accusations and many investigations by the International Commission have proved that it is not the Democratic Republic of Vietnam but the American and French colonialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem group themselves who are obstructing the people's freedom to choose their place of residence according to the Geneva Accords.

Many Catholics who were coerced to South Vietnam are living inhumane lives. The American and French imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem group forcibly conscripted strong men among these unfortunate people, sold people, threw many people into rubber plantations to do hard labor, and tried their best to prevent them from returning to their hometowns in North Vietnam.

American imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem group do not even conceal their purpose of looting North Vietnamese residents. The U.S. State Department and Collins have always regarded looting North Vietnamese people and controlling the South Vietnamese army as their two equally important tasks. In a conversation with American reporters, Ngo Dinh Diem openly admitted that looting these people to South Vietnam was to find a "balancing force" for the future universal elections. The population of North Vietnam is larger than that of South Vietnam, and they want to use this method of robbing the population to increase the number of residents in South Vietnam under the police terrorist rule of Ngo Dinh Diem, in order to undermine free and democratic universal elections. The American propaganda machine even blustered that there is "no freedom" in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, so universal elections cannot be held, etc.

Recently, the American imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem group openly proposed to extend the time for implementing Article 14(d) of the Geneva Accords, which is to extend the time for them to loot North Vietnamese residents unscrupulously. Members of the Ngo Dinh Diem group even said that if they are not allowed to extend the time for forcibly relocating people, the universal elections next year cannot be held. Everyone knows that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always firmly and correctly implemented the Geneva Accords, and has long issued a statement advocating the restoration of normal relations between the North and South Vietnamese regions, and has taken specific measures. The people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have complete freedom to travel, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also provides convenience and assistance to the people who travel between the North and the South. However, American imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem group oppose and obstruct the restoration of normal relations between North and South Vietnam, and prevent people from traveling freely. This exposes that their call to extend the deadline for civilian relocation is just to create an excuse to openly undermine the ceasefire agreement in order to achieve their goal of undermining the universal elections and undermining the unification of Vietnam.

The American aggressive group's series of activities to undermine the Geneva Accords in Indochina were carried out with the understanding of France and Britain, and in many aspects with the direct participation of French colonialists; especially in suppressing the people's forces and undermining the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, France and the United States are consistent. Therefore, France and Britain, especially France, cannot shirk their responsibility for the Indochina issue.

For more than nine months, although the American aggressive group, the French colonialists, and the Ngo Dinh Diem group have been constantly obstructing and undermining the implementation of the Geneva Accords, their sabotage conspiracies have been met with increasingly fierce opposition from the Vietnamese people. The struggle of the Indochinese people against American interference and for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords is intensifying, and their strength is enormous. As General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, pointed out in his memorandum to the Vietnamese International Commission in December last year, the will of the Vietnamese people to fight for peace, independence, unification, and democracy is unshakable. With the support of the people of the world, this struggle of the Vietnamese people will surely be victorious, and the conspiracy of American imperialism and its followers to undermine the Geneva Accords is doomed to failure.

　　越南停战以来
　　杜展潮　沈定一
    自从签订日内瓦协定到现在，已经差不多十个月了。在这个期间，延续八年之久的印度支那战争是停下来了。
    按照越法双方协议的规定，到五月十六日止，法兰西联邦部队全部离开其在北越的最后驻扎地区海防区，越南人民军也全部撤出中越的广义、平定地区。十七度线附近的临时军事分界线以北的越南北部地区至此全部获得解放。日内瓦协定有关停火、划分临时军事分界线、部队集结和转移等条款，基本上得到了实施。今后主要的问题，是继续坚决贯彻日内瓦协定的精神和条款，巩固越南的和平、防止战争再起、保障人民的自由民主权利和实现普选以完成越南的统一和独立。此外，还有停战协定所规定的一些条款，例如释放全部战俘和被拘平民等，由于法军当局没有彻底履行而形成悬案，也须要继续加以解决。
    在过去的九个多月中，由于美帝国主义千方百计的阻挠和破坏，不仅使贯彻日内瓦会议最后宣言和日内瓦协定的有关防止战争再起、保证人民的民主自由权利和举行普选的条款，受到严重的障碍；而且就在实施停止敌对行动方面的条款时，也受到了影响。
    从新近交接海防地区和广义、平定地区的具体行动中，就可以看出两种不同的对待日内瓦协定的态度。
       在海防地区第一阶段的交接中，法军当局在撤退前对公共财产大肆劫运和破坏。法军这种横暴地违反协议的劫运和破坏行为，是在美帝国主义的指使和直接参与下进行的。为了加紧劫运海防地区的公共财产和人民，前美国总统特使柯林斯曾亲自到那里去督促过，而在海防的美国军官则公开到各企业和学校去，以取回“美援物资”为名，劫运公共财产。
    和上述事实形成强烈对照的，是越南人民军那种始终不渝地彻底履行协定的精神和行动。越南人民军如期或提前撤出了南越和中越的咸津、川木地区，同塔梅地区，严格地保护当地人民的民主自由权利和当地的公共财产。当提前撤离南越最后一个临时驻扎地段——金瓯角时，越南人民军不但完整地移交了当地的各种公共财产和档案，而且在把集结时新增建的医院、学校和增添的其他公共设备也全部移交给了对方。在这次办理广义、平定地区移交第一阶段的工作中，越南人民军同样表现着这种精神。移交金瓯地区时，连法方的代表也承认“情况良好”。
    日内瓦会议根据印度支那三个国家不同的情况，分别规定了各国实现统一、独立的具体方法和步骤。在越南，要在一九五六年七月内实行自由普选，以实现全国统一。日内瓦会议最后宣言并规定，从一九五五年七月二十日开始，双方即应进行协商以讨论明年普选问题。
    但是，使越南恢复和平统一，是和美帝国主义的战争政策不符的，是和它蓄意要把印度支那变成它的殖民地和军事基地的阴谋不符的。因此，美帝国主义一直在加紧进行破坏活动。
    美帝国主义者在越南进行的破坏活动，概括起来主要的有以下三个方面：第一，加紧实行柯林斯计划，加强对南越的军事控制，把南越变成美国军事基地。第二，竭力扶植和加强吴庭艳集团的恐怖统治，侵犯人民民主自由权利，对于曾经参加抗战的爱国人民加以报复杀害。第三，不惜采取一切卑鄙恶毒的手段，扰乱越南民主共和国管辖的北越地区，破坏当地人民和平宁静的生活，劫运人力和物力。
    从停战到今年一月，在十七度线以南的法军驻扎地区，已发生杀害人民和报复事件二千三百多起，共有八百多人被杀，三千七百多人负伤，一万三千人被捕。吴庭艳集团并在南越的西贡、堤岸和中越的顺化一带，镇压人民的和平运动，大批搜捕拥护日内瓦协定的和平人士。
    美帝国主义不断地干涉南越的内政扶持吴庭艳，通过这个傀儡来加强美国对南越的直接控制，破坏日内瓦协定。美国决定每年以两亿到三亿美元来加强南越的军队，从法国手里夺取了控制和直接训练南越军队的权力。一方面，它帮助吴庭艳建立嫡系军队。美国的军事顾问已渗入了南越陆军的参谋部，美国的军官已在一些军事学校和军队中发号施令，美国的特务正在直接指挥吴庭艳集团分子施用恐怖手段来镇压和屠杀人民。另一方面，美国又指使并且支持吴庭艳吞并南越各教派的军队，排除亲法势力和一切异己势力。最近，吴庭艳和各教派军队间的火并，就是由于美国的这种干涉政策造成的。南越的混乱局势，已使成千成万人民死伤和倾家荡产。
    美帝国主义极端仇视越南民主共和国，惧怕越南民主共和国政府在整个越南以及印度支那人民中崇高的威望。越南民主共和国的存在和发展是美帝国主义实现它把越南和整个印度支那变成其殖民地和军事基地的阴谋的不可逾越的障碍。美帝国主义及其追随者法国殖民主义分子和吴庭艳集团，一直是把削弱和破坏越南民主共和国，作为它们的主要目标之一。它们为了这个目标而制造出来的最突出的事件，就是大规模地劫运北越居民。
    从停战开始之日起，美、法帝国主义分子就有计划地进行了这项阴谋活动。它们派遣特务爪牙到十七度线以北，披着宗教的外衣，用战争和原子弹来威胁人民，用各种方法来欺骗和强迫人民迁移到南部去。
    许多新闻已报道过他们掳掠人民的说不尽的罪恶。美国曾出动了整个舰队到海防去劫运人民，法国方面利用军事行政力量威胁人民迁居。法军和吴庭艳分子甚至派飞机轰炸或者放火烧掉整个村庄，强迫那些村庄的居民迁移到南部去。在法军临时集结区内的人民，根本丧失了根据日内瓦协定十四条丁款和日内瓦会议最后宣言第八项的规定选择自己居住地区的自由权利。
    同时，美、法帝国主义分子还处心积虑地在越南民主共和国境内的天主教徒聚居地区胁骗人民到南越去。他们派出大批特务，甚至组织武装骚动，破坏当地的生产和土地改革运动。法国军队并出动飞机、军舰侵犯越南民主共和国的领空、领海，在一些沿海地区制造紧张空气，以配合特务们的战争宣传，恫吓人民到南越去。法方向国际委员会诬告越南民主共和国方面“阻挠”人民南迁，正是为了掩护它自己的这些违反停战协定的罪恶活动。人民的控诉和国际委员会的许多次调查都证明，阻碍人民根据日内瓦协定选择居住地区的自由的不是越南民主共和国而正是美法殖民分子和吴庭艳集团自己。
    许多天主教徒被胁骗到南越去后，过着非人的生活。美、法帝国主义分子和吴庭艳集团在这些不幸的人们中强征壮丁，贩卖人口，把许多人投进橡胶园做苦工，并竭力阻止他们返回北越的故乡。
    美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团甚至并不隐讳他们劫运北越居民的目的。美国国务院和柯林斯一直就把劫运北越人民和控制南越军队作为他们的两个同等重要的任务。在一次对美国记者的谈话中，吴庭艳公开承认劫运这些人到南越去是为将来的普选找
  “平衡力量”。越南北部人口比南部人口多，他们想用这种抢劫人口的办法来增加南越吴庭艳警察恐怖统治下的居民的数目，以便于破坏自由民主的普选。美国宣传机器更大放厥词说在越南民主共和国内“没有自由”，因此普选不可能举行等等。
    最近，美帝国主义分子和吴庭艳集团公然提出要延长履行日内瓦协定十四条丁款的时间，也就是延长让他们肆无忌惮地劫运北越居民的时间。吴庭艳集团分子甚至说，如果不延长让他们强迫人民迁移的时间，就不能举行明年的普选。大家知道，越南民主共和国一直坚决正确地执行日内瓦协定，并且早已发表声明，主张恢复北越和南越地区之间的正常关系，并采取了具体措施。越南民主共和国的人民完全有往来的自由，越南民主共和国对于南北往来的人民也给予便利和帮助。但是美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团却反对并阻挠北越和南越之间正常关系的恢复，阻止人民自由往来。这就暴露了他们叫喊要延长平民迁居期限的要求，不过是想制造借口，公开破坏停战协定，以达到他们破坏普选、破坏越南统一的目的。
    美国侵略集团在印度支那的一系列的破坏日内瓦协定的活动，是在法国和英国的谅解下进行的，有许多方面是在法国殖民主义分子的直接参加下进行的；尤其是在镇压人民力量，破坏越南民主共和国这一点上，法国和美国是一致的。所以法国和英国，尤其是法国，不能推卸他们在印度支那问题上的责任。
    九个多月来，虽然美国侵略集团、法国殖民分子和吴庭艳集团不断地阻挠和破坏日内瓦协定的实现，但是，他们的破坏阴谋已遭到越南人民愈来愈激烈的反对。印度支那人民反对美国干涉和彻底实现日内瓦协定的斗争正在加紧进行，他们的力量是巨大的。正如越南人民军总司令武元甲将军在去年十二月间给越南国际委员会的备忘录中所指出的，越南人民为争取和平、独立、统一和民主而斗争的意志是不可动摇的。在世界人民的支持下，越南人民的这一斗争必将获得胜利，美帝国主义和它的追随者破坏日内瓦协定的阴谋是注定要失败的。
