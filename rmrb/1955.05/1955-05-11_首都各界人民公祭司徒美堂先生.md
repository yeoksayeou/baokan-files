Xinhua News Agency, 10th. People from all walks of life in the capital held a public memorial service on the morning of the 10th for Mr. Situ Meitang, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, a member of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China.

The public memorial service was held in the Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park.

Zhongshan Hall was filled with wreaths sent by people from all walks of life. In front of Mr. Situ Meitang's coffin were wreaths from Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai.

The public memorial service was presided over by Zhou Enlai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Chen Yun, Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Dong Biwu, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Peng Zhen, Chen Qiyou, Liao Chengzhi, and Chen Qiyuan were also in attendance.

Those who attended the public memorial service included Li Weihan, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and some members, Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General, heads of various ministries and commissions, He Xiangning, Vice Chairman of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and some standing committee members, Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Gao Kelin and Zhang Zhirang, Vice Presidents of the Supreme People's Court, Fang Fang and Zhuang Xiquan, Deputy Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations, some members of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, as well as representatives of the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Association and relatives and friends of Mr. Situ Meitang.

More than 700 people attended the public memorial service.

As the public memorial service began, the band played mournful music. The presiding officer, Premier Zhou Enlai, presented a wreath to Mr. Situ Meitang's coffin.

Then, Liao Chengzhi, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, delivered a eulogy.

Liao Chengzhi said: Mr. Situ Meitang's death is a loss to us. The path taken by Mr. Situ Meitang throughout his life reflects the path taken by patriotic overseas Chinese since the Opium War. When the corrupt and feudal Qing Dynasty still ruled our people, Mr. Situ Meitang participated in the struggle against the Qing government. Later, when the Chinese people began their first domestic revolutionary war, Mr. Situ Meitang, along with many patriotic overseas Chinese at the time, carried out activities against the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Situ Meitang actively supported the motherland's people in resisting Japan in the Americas and resolutely opposed surrender. He once maintained close contact with the China Defense League led by Ms. Soong Ching Ling, despite attacks from the Kuomintang, and supported the main force of the Chinese people's resistance against Japan—the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army.

After the great victory of the motherland's people in the Anti-Japanese War, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek launched a civil war and attacked the liberated areas. Mr. Situ Meitang then went through many twists and turns, returning to the United States twice to call on overseas Chinese in the United States to support the motherland's people's revolutionary struggle.

After the victory of the great liberation war of the motherland's people in 1949, Mr. Situ Meitang returned to the motherland to participate in the construction cause. For more than five years, Mr. Situ Meitang, like the vast majority of the 12 million overseas Chinese, has stood on a patriotic stand, supporting the People's Republic of China, supporting the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, opposing the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, and opposing imperialist aggression against our country.

Liao Chengzhi finally said: In recent years, the ranks of patriotic overseas Chinese abroad, numbering in the tens of thousands, are even larger and stronger than their predecessors. The new generation of overseas Chinese sincerely appreciates and will never forget the pioneering role played by their older generation of overseas Chinese. They will inherit the cause of their predecessors and advance with the people of the motherland in even grander strides. The mutual encouragement and unity between the older and new generations of overseas Chinese will inevitably further promote the expansion and consolidation of the patriotic cause of overseas Chinese.

Chen Qiyuan, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, then reported on Mr. Situ Meitang's life and deeds. He said: Mr. Situ Meitang was a leader of patriotic overseas Chinese in the Americas. At the age of seventeen, he joined the Hongmen Society Zhi Gong Tang in the United States to fight against the Qing government. From 1904, he followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen in participating in the democratic revolutionary movement. Since then, Mr. Situ Meitang has always stood on the position of loving the motherland, actively supporting and supporting the cause of the Chinese people's revolution, and carrying out various tasks. In the most recent six years, Mr. Situ Meitang has actively participated in various political movements, frequently speaking out to overseas Chinese, exposing and denouncing the towering crimes of American imperialism's aggression against China and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's harming of overseas Chinese, and expanding the great unity of patriotic overseas Chinese. Mr. Situ Meitang firmly supported the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

After Chen Qiyuan's speech, the coffin was moved. Premier Zhou Enlai, Lin Boqu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the personnel participating in the public memorial service held the ropes of the coffin.

At 1 p.m., Mr. Situ Meitang's remains were buried in the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery.

　　首都各界人民公祭司徒美堂先生
    新华社十日讯　首都各界人民十日上午公祭中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会委员、中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会委员司徒美堂先生。
    公祭大会在中山公园中山堂举行。
    中山堂里摆满了各界人民送的花圈。在司徒美堂先生灵柩前面，排列着毛泽东主席、朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理送的花圈。
    公祭大会由中国共产党中央委员会书记处书记、中华人民共和国国务院总理、中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会主席周恩来主祭。陪祭的有陈云、林伯渠、李济深、董必武、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、彭真、陈其尤、廖承志、陈其瑗。
    参加公祭的有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李维汉和部分委员，国务院副总理陈毅，秘书长习仲勋，各部和各委员会的负责人，中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会副主席何香凝和部分常务委员，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，最高人民法院副院长高克林、张志让，华侨事务委员会副主任方方、庄希泉，各民主党派和各人民团体的负责人，中国致公党中央委员会部分委员，以及北京归国华侨联谊会代表和司徒美堂先生的亲友。
    参加公祭的共有七百多人。
    公祭开始时，乐队奏起哀乐。主祭人周恩来总理向司徒美堂先生灵柩献花圈。
    接着，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会副主任廖承志致悼词。
    廖承志说：司徒美堂先生的逝世是我们的一个损失。司徒美堂先生一生所走的道路，反映着国外爱国侨胞自从鸦片战争以来所走过的道路。当腐败的满清封建朝廷还统治我国人民的时代，司徒美堂先生就参加了反对满清政府的斗争。以后，当中国人民开始进行第一次国内革命战争的时候，司徒美堂先生同当时许多华侨爱国分子一起进行了反对蒋介石卖国集团的活动。抗日战争爆发以后，司徒美堂先生在美洲积极拥护祖国人民抗战，坚决反对投降。他曾经不顾国民党的攻击，同宋庆龄先生领导的保卫中国大同盟保持着密切接触，支持了中国人民的抗战主力部队——八路军和新四军。
    祖国人民伟大的抗日战争胜利以后，卖国贼蒋介石发动内战进攻解放区，司徒美堂先生当时经过许多曲折，两次回到美国，号召美国侨胞支持祖国人民的革命斗争。
    一九四九年祖国人民伟大的解放战争胜利以后，司徒美堂先生回祖国参加了建设事业。五年多以来，司徒美堂先生正像国外一千二百万绝大多数华侨所站的爱国立场一样，拥护中华人民共和国，拥护中国共产党和毛泽东主席，反对蒋介石卖国集团，反对帝国主义对我国的侵略。
    廖承志最后说：这几年来，国外成千成万的爱国华侨的队伍，比起他们的前一辈的人们是更为浩大更为健壮了。国外华侨这新的一代对于他们老一代华侨所起的先行者的作用，是诚挚地感谢的，是永远不会忘记的，他们将继承前人的事业，迈着更为壮阔的大步随着祖国人民前进。华侨中老的一代和新的一代的互相勉励，互相团结，必然会更进一步地推动华侨爱国事业的扩大和巩固。
    中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会委员陈其瑗接着报告司徒美堂先生生平事略。他说：司徒美堂先生是美洲方面的爱国华侨领袖，十七岁在美国加入洪门会致公堂，进行反对满清政府的斗争。一九零四年起追随孙中山先生参加民主主义革命运动。以后，司徒美堂先生一直是站在热爱祖国、积极拥护和支持中国人民革命事业的立场上，进行各种工作。在最近的六年来，司徒美堂先生积极参加各项政治运动，经常对国外华侨发言，揭发和痛斥美帝国主义侵略中国以及蒋介石卖国集团祸侨害侨的滔天罪行，扩大华侨的爱国大团结。对解放台湾的斗争，司徒美堂先生是坚决拥护的。
    陈其瑗讲话以后开始起灵。执绋的有周恩来总理和中国共产党中央委员会政治局委员、全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林伯渠以及参加公祭的人员。
    下午一时，司徒美堂先生遗体在八宝山烈士公墓安葬。
