　　Collecting Scrap Steel: Anshan Iron and Steel Youth
　　Cui Yulin Yang Guisheng
　　Beginning in mid-March of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company launched a campaign to collect scrap steel and iron. Over 20,000 young workers at Anshan Iron and Steel organized 206 youth conservation teams and voluntary labor teams to actively participate in this movement. More than 140 young workers at the Primary Rolling Mill, after hearing the call to collect scrap steel and iron on March 17th, all arrived at the factory an hour and twenty minutes early the next day. As soon as the order to "Begin collecting scrap steel and iron" was issued, they acted as if going into battle, with the Youth League flag flying, carrying shovels, picks, large carrying poles, and baskets, crowding to the loess hills and large pits with scrap steel and iron to begin their activities. In just forty minutes, they collected dozens of kinds of equipment and steel, including large toothed wheels, scrap iron pipes, and pump scales, totaling over three tons. The Jin Han'en Youth Conservation Team of the Steelmaking Engineering Company, with a total of sixteen members, has collected nine tons of scrap steel and iron from mid-March to the present. This includes thirty-five meters of electrical wire, thirty meters of steel cable, more than three hundred different screws, and two hundred and eighty-nine tools. When the call to collect scrap steel and iron was issued, the Jin Han'en Youth Conservation Team immediately took action. Their slogan was: "Turn scrap steel and iron into good steel, and increase the strength of building a socialist society!" On the first day of collecting scrap steel and iron, they divided into four groups and launched a competition to collect scrap steel and iron in their spare time. Team member Yang Hailiang was the first to carry out a large rail head weighing more than 300 kilograms from a ditch two or three meters deep. Sun Yongkang next to him was not to be outdone, quickly jumped into the ditch, and also carried a large piece of iron up. …
　　Currently, the movement to collect scrap steel and iron is still continuing at Anshan Iron and Steel, and the young workers are constantly expanding their achievements.

　　搜集废钢铁的鞍钢青年们
　　崔玉琳　杨贵生
    从今年三月中旬起，鞍山钢铁公司开展了搜集废钢废铁运动。鞍钢两万多青年职工组织了二百零六个青年节约队和义务劳动队，积极地参加了这个运动。初轧厂的一百四十多个青年职工，在三月十七日听到搜集废钢铁的号召以后，第二天就都提前一小时二十分到厂。“开始搜集废钢铁”的命令刚一发出，他们就像进行战斗一样，在飘扬着的团旗下面，扛着铁锹、洋镐、大扁担、抬筐，拥到有废钢铁的黄土岗、大坑等处展开活动。仅仅四十分钟的时间，他们就搜集了大牙轮、废铁管、泵称等数十种器材和钢铁，共重三吨以上。炼钢工程公司的晋汉恩青年节约队一共有十六个人，从三月中旬到现在，已经搜集了九吨废钢铁。其中有三十五公尺长的电线。三十公尺长的钢绳，有三百多个不同的螺丝，还有二百八十九件工具。当搜集废钢铁的号召发出以后，晋汉恩青年节约队就立刻行动起来。他们的口号是：“把废钢铁变成好钢铁，增加建设社会主义社会的力量！”在开始搜集废钢铁的第一天，他们就分成四个小组，在业余时间展开搜集废钢铁竞赛。队员杨海亮首先从二、三公尺深的沟里，把一根三百多斤重的大铁轨头扛出来。旁边的孙永康也不示弱，迅速跳到沟里，也扛了一块大铁块爬上来。……
    现在，搜集废钢铁的运动还在鞍钢继续开展，青年职工们也正在不断地扩大自己的战果。
