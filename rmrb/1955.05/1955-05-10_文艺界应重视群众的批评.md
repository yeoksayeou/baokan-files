The Literary and Art Circles Should Value Mass Criticism
Liang Ruhai
    The city of Wuhan recently held the third Opera Festival. During the festival, members of the Wuhan City Dockworkers' Amateur Cultural Troupe held a forum to offer much criticism of the performances of professional theater troupes, expressing dissatisfaction with the lack of new plays—especially those reflecting the lives of workers. Worker Chen Binshan said:
   “In recent years, Wuhan's theater troupes have staged many excellent plays that have been welcomed by audiences; but audiences become dissatisfied when the same few plays are performed over and over again.” Worker Ma Wenqing asked: "Why are these few plays always performed? It's either 'Broken Bridge,' 'Qin Xianglian,' or 'Autumn River,' 'Hundred Day Romance.' We hope to see some new plays!” Worker Guan Zongyi said to the theatrical workers attending the forum: “You can't go on like this any longer, our amateur cultural troupe is waiting for you! Of course, we must also work hard to create, but more importantly, the experts can give us new scripts.”
    This is not only the voice of Wuhan workers, but also the voice of the broad masses of audiences across the country. In the countryside, farmers have long criticized the old-fashioned plays. Farmers call those plays that awkwardly incorporate production "hoe plays" (entering the stage with a hoe on their backs, leaving the stage with a hoe on their backs); they criticize those dull and uninteresting performances as "donkeys eating lime - a white mouth." What important opinions these are! The broad masses of workers and peasants demand to see the diverse new life of new China on the stage, hoping to see vivid images, and are not satisfied with the monotonous content and boring sermons that are always the same. This is a concrete manifestation of their gradually improving appreciation level, and in this respect, we must not use old eyes to look at the workers and peasants of new China.
    Cultural and artistic workers have not completely failed to hear the opinions and criticisms of the masses, and they often say verbally, "Our work lags behind the needs of the people." But in reality, this situation has not improved significantly, and some literary and art workers even ideologically continue to oppose popularization and improvement, ignoring the importance of improvement on the basis of popularization. This is the result of not truly understanding the needs of the people.
    The people are not only enthusiastic audiences, but also stern critics. When our literary and artistic endeavors first emerge with something new, the people always warmly praise and welcome it; when our literary and artistic work appears backward, they will put forward sharp criticisms. Yes, sometimes the masses say nothing, but silence is sometimes a very harsh criticism. The reduced attendance rates of many theater troupes are a concrete manifestation of this criticism.
    The people cherish new literary and artistic undertakings. They have never made excessive demands. Our literary and art circles should seriously consider and gradually solve the problems raised by the masses.

### 文艺界应重视群众的批评

　　文艺界应重视群众的批评
　　梁汝怀
    武汉市最近举行了第三届戏曲观摩演出大会。在会演期中，武汉市搬运工人业余文工团的团员曾经举行座谈会，对专业剧团的演出活动提出了不少批评，对新剧目——特别是反映工人生活的剧目的缺乏，表示不满。工人陈斌山说：
  “几年来，武汉市各剧团上演了不少优秀剧目，受到观众的欢迎；可是翻来复去老是那几出戏，观众就不满足了。”工人马文卿问：“为什么老是演这几个戏呢？不是‘断桥’、‘秦香莲’，就是‘秋江’、‘百日缘’。希望看到一些新的戏！”工人官宗义向参加座谈会的戏剧工作者说：“你们不能再这样下去了，我们业余文工团也等着你们呢！当然我们也要努力创作，但更重要的是专家们能给我们新的剧本。”
    这不只是武汉工人的呼声，而是全国各地广大观众的呼声。在农村里，农民早就对老一套的戏提出批评了。农民称那些生硬地结合生产的戏为“锄头戏”（背锄头上场，背锄头下场）；批评那些枯燥乏味的演出是“驴子吃石灰——一张白嘴”。这是多么值得重视的意见呀！广大工农观众要求在舞台上看到新中国多种多样的新生活，希望看到生动的形象，不满足于千篇一律的单调的内容和枯燥的说教。这是他们的欣赏水平逐渐提高的具体表现，在这方面也决不能用旧眼光看新中国的工农群众了。
    文化艺术工作者不是完全没有听到群众的意见和批评，在口头上也常说“我们的工作，落后于人民群众的需要”。但实际上这种情况一直没有显著的改进，有的文艺工作者甚至在思想上依然把普及和提高对立起来，忽视了在普及的基础上提高的重要性，这是没有真正了解人民群众的需要的结果。
    人民群众不仅是热情的观众，同时也是严正的批评家。当我们的文学艺术事业刚刚出现一些新的东西的时候，人民总是热烈地赞美它，欢迎它；当我们的文艺工作显得落后的时候，他们就会提出尖锐的批评。是的，有时群众没有说什么，但沉默有时也是一种很严厉的批评。很多剧团的上座率减低，就是这种批评的具体表现。
    人民是爱护新的文学艺术事业的。他们从来没有提出过份的苛求。我们的文艺界应该认真考虑和逐步解决群众所提出的问题了。
