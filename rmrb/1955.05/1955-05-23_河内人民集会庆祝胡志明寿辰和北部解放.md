Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 22nd: Over 50,000 people from all walks of life in Hanoi held a rally on the morning of the 22nd to celebrate President Ho Chi Minh's 65th birthday and the complete liberation of the northern region of Vietnam.

On the rostrum at the conference were Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam Lien Viet Front; Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister and Phan Ke Toai, Minister of the Interior, representatives of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; Vo Nguyen Giap, representative of the General Command of the People's Army; and Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and Hoang Quoc Viet, member of the Political Bureau.

Diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries also attended the meeting.

Ton Duc Thang spoke first. He said that President Ho Chi Minh's life and his career are inseparable from the history of the Vietnamese national liberation revolution. He pointed out President Ho Chi Minh's contributions to the Vietnamese revolution.

Ton Duc Thang then said that after the complete liberation of the northern half of our country, our task is to continue to implement the unfulfilled provisions of the agreement with the other party, to oppose the re-ignition of the war in Indochina, and to unify the motherland through free general elections. Ton Duc Thang called for a resolute struggle to consolidate peace and achieve national reunification.

General Vo Nguyen Giap then spoke. He said that the liberation of the northern half has laid a solid foundation for the struggle to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete national independence and democracy. Now is the time to struggle for a new period of implementing the Geneva Accords, namely, a period of consolidating peace, preventing the recurrence of war, achieving consultations, and then unifying the country through free general elections.

General Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that the policy of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to steadfastly respect and implement the agreement. However, US imperialism and its lackeys are stepping up their efforts to sabotage the agreement, undermine peace, and obstruct the unification of our country.

Vo Nguyen Giap said that we must continue to struggle to implement the armistice agreement, demanding that the other party hold consultation meetings with us as scheduled to discuss and adopt the issue of achieving national unification through free general elections. At the same time, we must fight against the conspiracy to drag South Vietnam into any military alliance and against the conspiracy to strengthen South Vietnam's military to prepare for war.

The speeches by Ton Duc Thang and Vo Nguyen Giap were warmly welcomed by the participants. The conference finally adopted a resolution, and passed a telegram of respect to President Ho Chi Minh and a telegram of condolence to the people of the South.
