How to Write Poetry
　　——Introducing Isakovsky's "On the Techniques of Poetry"
　　Yuan Shuipai
　　Many people who submit poems to newspapers and periodicals hope to know how to write poetry. They are dissatisfied with the rejection letters from the editorial department. The rejection letters point out that their manuscripts are "empty," "generalized," "hasty," "lack enthusiasm," and "cannot move people." Similarly, they also feel that these rejection letters are "empty," "generalized," "hasty," "lack enthusiasm," and even make them angry to read.
　　So, let us learn some necessary knowledge about poetry creation from the book "On the Techniques of Poetry" by the Soviet poet Isakovsky. The general creative shortcomings and problems pointed out in the book are similar to ours.
　　To consider how to write poetry, we must first consider what kind of poetry readers need.
　　Today, our readers are none other than the builders and defenders of the motherland; or if they are not now, they will be in the future. Therefore, what they ask of poetry is that it can help and improve their understanding, contribute to their labor and struggle, inspire all their good sentiments, and enrich their lives and minds.
　　The study of theoretical science and the labor struggle itself can enable people to obtain these things, but literature and art influence people with their special methods. It is not as abstract as theory, with many formulas and concepts; nor is it necessarily very typical and concentrated like life itself. Moreover, a person's life range is ultimately limited.
　　Poetry, like other literature and art, influences readers with typical images of the real life it reflects. Its advantage is that it is almost as real, easy to feel, and compelling as life itself.
　　Since readers need such works, writers can only strive to do so. Since poetry should be as real as life itself, writers must first have a rich life. However, many contributors are precisely lacking in this aspect. They have not gone deep into society and have not had any relatively significant life struggle experiences.
　　If this is not the case, and the writer's life is very rich, then the problem may still occur in their academic cultivation. They lack the necessary cultural knowledge (including knowledge of classical and folk poetry of their own country and foreign countries), and their political and ideological levels are not high. Even if they have life experience, they still lack the ability to understand life (its essence, movement) and people, and they are still not good enough in mastering the scientific worldview and standing firm on the position of the advanced class.
　　Isakovsky repeatedly mentioned in this book that poets cannot be divorced from life, must "accumulate various knowledge and life experiences," and must "strive to reach a very high cultural level," and "should be a ... knowledgeable and insightful person." He emphasizes the importance of political cultivation. Poets must cultivate themselves into a "modern advanced person," "should know more than an ordinary citizen," and "see further." He does not believe that a person with a poor inner world, backwardness, lack of education, and inactive labor can write good works.
　　Having life experience and being able to understand life requires the ability to express life. Only in this way can the reality of real life be transformed into the reality of artistic images.
　　Isakovsky wants us to pay attention to the following.
　　He opposes incoherent sentences that do not conform to grammar, and opposes semantic lack of logic. This is repeatedly emphasized by the author. Due to translation difficulties, many examples are omitted in the translation. This is a problem that we should also pay attention to. Even in our already popular songs, there are such errors. For example, there is a saying in one song "Tank driver matched with a tractor." In fact, what the author wants to say is that a young soldier who is a tank driver falls in love with a female tractor driver, but here it becomes a love between a person and a machine. Another song has the saying "Emotions as high as ten thousand feet." There is also a rare noun in another song called "young man," which is actually "young lad."
　　Isakovsky wants us to pay attention to the problem of conceptualization. He said that "argument" cannot replace concrete images, "the idea of poetry is often not expressed directly, often not by the poet's direct statement, but by indirect methods (which is also one of the characteristics of artistic creation). It exists independently, as if it has nothing to do with the author's will, but arises naturally and reasonably from the life materials adopted by the author in his works." People who learn to write poetry often just repeat what is said in newspaper editorials, and it does not become poetry.
　　For those who already know that it is not appropriate to talk about principles in poetry, but mistakenly think that it is good to use more words to express psychological states such as "enthusiasm," "joy," "pain," and "sadness," Isakovsky's other warning is also useful. He said, do not "directly call these emotions" in poetry, you must make readers naturally generate these emotions.
　　In addition to these opinions, which also apply to other literary styles, the author talked a lot about his valuable experiences on the characteristics of poetry. Of course, the author himself also said that these are just his personal opinions. Other poets will have other opinions. But undoubtedly his opinion is not wrong.
　　He wants people not to misunderstand that poetry is something that is easy to do and can be written casually. It requires specialized training, just like a doctor needs to study medicine first. But today our understanding of this point is very insufficient.
　　Isakovsky believes that a poem or song should basically have a certain, even the simplest ordinary plot. This plot is about the fate of a certain person or group of people, and this plot contains a center of gravity, which is the "message" or theme that the author wants to convey to the reader. Let us think about those lyric poems that even have only twenty words each, such as "Moonlight in front of the bed...", and such as "The peaks on Mount Liupan...", which also contain characters, plots, certain environments, and time, without any ambiguity. The mental state of the characters they portray is profound and powerful, and the theme is clear and prominent.
　　But they are so concise! High degree of concentration and generalization. This poetic technique is also emphasized by Isakovsky. He said that poetry must be concise, and the development of each line should not be slow, let alone run wild away from the center of gravity. Therefore, he particularly emphasizes the conception of poetry, and opposes pulling in many different themes in a poem with not much length, creating a complicated and sprawling impression, with many sentences belonging to their own, not serving a unified goal.
　　Originality, or creative independence, is repeatedly stated in this book. The author opposes echoing others, clichés, repeating general concepts that everyone knows, and using words that others have already written and said. He emphasizes that it must be the author's own thoughts and feelings, the author's personal feelings, and that they must be expressed in their own unique way and unique style. The poet calls this the "secret of poetry." Of course, this own thoughts and feelings are by no means the things in the minds of subjective idealists and individualists. It is both the poet's own and the people's, the advanced class'. Isakovsky said that when it comes to ideology, what is meant is the ideology of our era, the ideology of our people, and the ideology of our Party. Only in this way will the content of poetry be equally important and interesting to the broad masses and to the author. Otherwise, it will fall into the trap of "art for art's sake" and writing for personal gain.
　　Let me quote a few more of his pertinent words: "Suppose a poet writes a poem because of something that moves him. This means that that thing will definitely pass through the poet's consciousness, through his heart, and through his entire body and mind before being written into the poem. ... When describing this thing, he will also put his understanding of this thing, his views on this thing, and his thoughts and feelings into the poem. ... Naturally, he should also be objective, that is, he should correctly understand what happened, do not distort it, and do not violate the truth." The unity of the subjective and the objective is the principle of dialectical materialism, and using the subjective to distort the objective is the characteristic of idealism. This cannot be confused.
　　Lyric poetry often requires poets to lay out their inner world to readers, and many classical masterpieces are the outpouring of the poet's heart. Therefore, it is impossible to imagine that a backward, narrow-minded, selfish person can have an inner world worth laying out to readers. Therefore, the author repeatedly points out the importance of the poet's quality and personality. Of course, the content of lyric poetry is not limited to the author's inner world. The author's inner world is only a part of the infinitely rich objective object of real life that literature wants to reflect. But no matter what kind of subject matter is written, the poet's quality and world view are extremely important.
　　In addition, this book also has many discussions on the rhythm and rhyme of poetry, which can be used as a reference for our study of the national form of our poetry.
　　Isakovsky's book is very useful for Chinese poetry writers. He is a poet and an outstanding lyricist, and this book has a special discussion on songwriting. Today, our songwriting is not strong enough, and it is beneficial to study these articles. The author is a Soviet poet who is familiar and loved by Chinese readers, and many of his works have been introduced. Because of this, we have seen some "creations" similar to his works appear. We want to learn from him, but not imitate - which is exactly what Isakovsky repeatedly warns in this book.

　　怎样写诗
　　——介绍伊萨柯夫斯基著“谈诗的技巧”
　　袁水拍
    许多向报刊投寄诗稿的人希望知道写诗的方法。他们对编辑部的退稿信感到不满。退稿信指出他们的稿子“空洞”，“一般化”，“草率”，“缺乏热情”，“不能感动人”。同样，他们也觉得这些退稿信“空洞”，“一般化”，“草率”，“缺乏热情”，甚至看了使人生气。
    那么，让我们从苏联诗人伊萨柯夫斯基这本书学习一些关于诗歌创作的必要知识吧。书中所指出的一般创作上的缺点和问题，也和我们的差不多。
    要考虑怎样写诗的问题，先要考虑读者需要什么样的诗的问题。
    今天，我们的读者无非是祖国的建设者和保卫者；或者现在还不是，将来是。那么他们所要求于诗的，也就是希望它能够帮助和提高他们的认识，有助于他们的劳动和斗争，激厉他们的一切好的情操，丰富他们的生活和心灵。
    理论科学的学习和劳动斗争本身，都能使人得到这些，但是文学艺术是用它的特殊的方法来影响人的。它不像理论那样抽象化，有许多公式和概念；也不像生活本身那样不一定很典型，很集中。而且一个人的生活范围到底是有限的。
    诗歌和其他文学艺术一样，用它所反映的现实生活的典型形象来影响读者。它的好处是几乎和生活本身一样的真实、容易感受和使人不得不相信。
    既然读者需要这样的作品，写作者就只能努力去做到这样。既然诗应该和生活本身一样真实，写作者就不得不首先有丰富的生活。但是，许多投稿的人在这一方面恰恰是欠缺的。他们没有深入社会，没有什么比较重大的生活斗争经历。
    如果情况不是这样，写作者的生活很丰富，那末问题还可能发生在他们的学问修养方面。他们缺少必要的文化知识（包括对本国和外国的古典诗歌、民间诗歌的知识等），他们的政治水平、思想水平不高。他们有了生活，也还是缺少认识生活（它的本质、运动）和人的能力，在掌握科学的世界观和站稳先进阶级的立场方面还很不够。
    伊萨柯夫斯基在本书中多次谈到，诗人不能脱离生活，必须“多多积蓄各种知识和生活经验”，要“努力使自己达到很高的文化水准”，“应当是
  一个……博学的和目光敏锐的人”。他强调政治修养的重要性。诗人必须培养自己成为一个“现代先进的人”，“应当比一个普通的公民知道得更多”，“看得更远”。他不相信一个内心世界贫乏的、落后的、没有教养的、劳动不积极的人能够写出好作品来。
    有生活，能够认识生活——还需要表现生活的能力。只有这样，才能使现实生活的真实变为艺术形象的真实。
    伊萨柯夫斯基要我们注意下面这一些。
    他反对文句不通，不合文法，反对语意缺乏逻辑性。这是作者一再强调的。译本由于翻译上的困难，不少例子是省略了。这个问题同样是我们所应该注意的。即使在我们的已经流行的歌曲中，也有这类错误。例如有一首歌曲中有“坦克手配个拖拉机”的说法。实际上作者要说的是一个当坦克手的青年军人爱上了一个开拖拉机的女驾驶员，可是这里变成了人和机器的恋爱了。另一首歌曲中有
  “情绪高万丈”的说法。还有一首中出现一个少见的名词，叫“小伙”，实际上是“小伙子”。
    伊萨柯夫斯基要我们注意概念化的毛病。他说不能让“议论”来代替具体的形象，“诗的思想常常不是直截了当地表现出来的，常常不是以诗人直接说出的方法，而是以间接的方法表现出来的（这也正是艺术创作的特点之一）。它是独立存在的，它仿佛跟作者的意志无关，而是从作者在自己作品里所采用的生活材料中自然而然、合情合理地产生的。”学习写诗的人却常常只是把报纸社论中的话复述一下，不成其为诗。
    对于那些已经知道不宜在诗中讲道理，却误以为只要多用表现心理状态的字眼例如“热情”“愉快”“痛苦”“悲哀”就好的人，伊萨柯夫斯基的另一告诫，也是有益的。他说，不要在诗中“直接呼唤这些感情”，必须使读者自然而然产生这些感情。
    除了这些同样也适用于其他文学样式的意见之外，作者就诗的特点，谈了许多他的宝贵的经验之谈。当然，作者自己也说，这些只是他个人的意见。别的诗人会有别的意见。但无疑他的意见不是错误的。
    他要人们不要误解，以为诗是一种轻而易举、只消随便写写就行的东西。它需要专门的训练，正像一个医生需要先学医学一样。但是我们今天对这
  一点的认识正是很不够的。
    伊萨柯夫斯基认为一首诗或歌基本上应该有一定的、那怕是最简单的普通的情节，这情节有关于某一个人或某一群人的命运，这情节包含着一个重心，也就是作者所要传达给读者的“消息”或主题思想。让我们想一想那些即使每首只有二十来个字的抒情诗吧，例如“床前明月光……”，又如“六盘山上高峰……”，其中也有人物、情节、一定的环境、时间，丝毫也不含糊。它们所刻画的人物的精神状态是深刻有力的，主题思想是鲜明突出的。
    可是它们是多么精练啊！高度的集中和概括。这种诗的手法也是伊萨柯夫斯基所强调的。他说，诗歌必须精练，每一行的发展不宜缓慢，更不应该离开了重心跑野马。因此他特别强调诗的构思，反对在一首篇幅不多的诗中拉进许多不同的主题思想，造成烦琐支蔓的印象，许多句子各归各，不为统一的目标而服务。
    独创性，或者说创作上的独立性，是本书所一再申述的。作者反对人云亦云，陈词滥调，重复大家所知道的一般概念，搬用别人所早已写过、说过的话。他强调必须是作者自己的思想感情，作者的亲身感受，而且要以自己的特有的方式和独特的风格去表现。诗人把这称为“诗的秘密”。当然，这个自己的思想感情，决不是主观唯心主义者和个人主义者的心目中的东西。它既是诗人自己的，也是人民群众的、先进阶级的。伊萨柯夫斯基说，当说到思想性的时候，所指的是我们这时代的思想、我们人民的思想、我们党的思想。只有这样，诗的内容对于广大群众说来和对于作者说来，一样是重要的有趣的。否则就会掉进“为艺术而艺术”、为个人利益而写作的陷阱。
    让我再引用几句他的中肯的话：“假定有个诗人因为某一件使他激动的事情去写一首诗。这也就是说，那一件事情在写进诗中以前，一定会先通过诗人的意识，通过他的心灵，通过他的整个的身心。……描写这件事情的时候，也一定会把自己对这件事情的理解、自己对这件事情的看法、自己的思想与感情放进诗里。……自然，他同时也应当是客观的，也就是说应当正确地理解发生的事情，不要歪曲它，不要违背真实。”主观和客观的统一是辩证唯物主义的原则，用主观去歪曲客观是唯心主义的特色。这是不能混淆的。
    抒情诗常常需要诗人向读者摊开自己的内心世界，许多古典名作是诗人的心曲的倾诉。因此不能设想一个落后的、眼界狭隘的、自私自利的人能有什么值得向读者摊开的内心世界。因此，作者一再指出诗人的品质和人格的重要性。当然，抒情诗的内容也并不局限于作者的内心世界。作者的内心世界只是文学所要反映的无限丰富的现实生活的客观对象的一部分而已。但不管写什么样的题材，诗人的品质、世界观都是极端重要的。
    此外，关于诗的节奏韵律，本书也有不少讨论，可以作为我们研究自己的诗的民族形式的参证。
    伊萨柯夫斯基的书对于中国的诗歌作者是极有
  用处的。他是诗人，又是歌词的杰出的作者，本书
  对歌词创作有专门的论述。今天，我们的歌词创作
  不够旺盛，研究一下这些文章是有益的。作者是中国读者所熟悉和喜爱的苏联诗人，他的作品已经有不少介绍。也因此，我们看到了一些
  类似他的作品的“创作”出现。我们要向他学习，但不是模仿——这恰恰是伊萨柯夫斯基在这本书中反复警告的。
