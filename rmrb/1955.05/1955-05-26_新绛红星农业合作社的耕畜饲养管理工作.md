　　The collective raising of livestock by agricultural production cooperatives is a rather complex undertaking. When collective raising is first implemented, cooperative members lack experience and familiarity, and the livestock's living environment changes, making it prone to problems. Losses of livestock would seriously affect the cooperative's production, which in turn would affect the cooperative's consolidation. Improving livestock husbandry and management and summarizing experience in this area is essential.

　　The Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaonie Township, Xinjiang County, Shanxi Province, has a total of one hundred head of livestock, which must cultivate three thousand two hundred mu of land. The cooperative's backbone members and the masses of cooperative members all recognize that managing and raising livestock well is closely related to the collective interests of the entire cooperative and the personal interests of each member. The management committee selected eleven cooperative members with better husbandry techniques and a greater concern for collective interests to form a husbandry group. They also formulated several covenants for raising livestock through democratic discussion and approval by the management committee: (1) Four diligences: diligent in checking the trough, diligent in adding grass, diligent in providing water, diligent in bedding the pen (bedding the pen twice a day, cleaning the pen every ten days).
　　(2) Five essentials: grass must be chopped short, water tanks must be full, grass must be sifted clean, troughs must be scrubbed clean, and both inside and outside the pen must be swept clean. (3) Five attentions: pay attention to letting livestock rest after harnessing, pay attention to watering before use, pay attention to feeding on time, pay attention to daily inspection (treat immediately if illness is found), pay attention to cherishing livestock anytime and anywhere. They also stipulated that the husbandry group should hold a meeting every seven days to check work and exchange experiences. In three months, the husbandry group gained some management and husbandry experience.

　　In order to meticulously understand the temperament of the livestock, they divided the livestock into grades and categories, and assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible for feeding. Nine mules, fifteen horses, and fourteen donkeys were fixed on six double troughs respectively, and sixty-two cattle were fixed on nine double troughs. According to the technical expertise of the feeders, every two troughs were fixed with two feeders, dividing the work and cooperating, specializing in feeding. When the livestock entered the pen and approached the trough, the feeders tied them in fixed positions respectively. Over time, the livestock developed a habit of collective life, and after entering the pen, they automatically stood in their places to eat grass, and when leaving the pen, they came out in order one after another. After grading and classifying the livestock, the phenomenon of uneven hunger and satiety was avoided, and the livestock all became fat. For example, Zhao Lansheng's cattle were not well fed before joining the cooperative, and were so thin and weak; after collective feeding after joining the cooperative, they grew a sleek layer of fat.

　　The cooperative is large, and there are many livestock. In order to facilitate management, they gave each head of livestock a name. Mules and horses were named according to their color, such as "Little Yellow," "Big Grey Mule," "Date Red," etc.; cattle were named according to the shape of their horns and other characteristics, such as "Dragon Gate Horn," "Yin-Yang Horn," "Carrying Pole Horn," "Underbite," etc., and cattle bought back from Henan were called "Henan Cattle." They made one hundred small wooden signs; on one side of the wooden sign was written the name of the livestock, and on the other side was written the name of the production team responsible for using it. The wooden signs were handed over to the team leaders of each team. When the cooperative members used the livestock, they took the wooden sign from the team leader to pull the livestock. For example, if the team leader assigned a cooperative member to use "Henan Cattle" to plow the land, he would give the "Henan Cattle" sign to this cooperative member, and this cooperative member would take this wooden sign to the husbandry group and hand it to the staff on duty, check whether the "Henan Cattle" had any problems, and then pull it away. After the cattle were pulled away, the feeders hung the livestock's signs, by team, in order on the wooden sign with nails in the husbandry group. "Recognize the sign, not the person" has become a system for using livestock. In this way, mutual supervision can be played, and both those who feed the livestock and those who use the livestock can cherish the livestock. When Wang Suowen of the sixth team was driving a cart, the small saddle rubbed through the horse's back, and the staff on duty of the husbandry group raised an objection, but Wang Suowen did not accept it. The husbandry group raised this issue to the management committee, and the management committee held a meeting to criticize Wang Suowen. Wang Suowen admitted his mistake and automatically repaired the small saddle.

　　The entire cooperative's one hundred head of livestock need two hundred dan of water every day. In order to save labor for the cooperative, the feeders used their brains and came up with a way: they dug two small water channels from the two well platforms near the husbandry group to the breeding farm, and dug two holes under the wall of the breeding farm, burying a water tank in each hole. After the water was drawn from the well, it was poured into the small water channel, and the water flowed into the tank. Many water tanks were also set up near these two tanks to store water. After finding this trick, two people doing this job was enough to top eight people doing this job, and six man-days could be saved in one day. The entire cooperative's livestock needs one thousand two hundred jin of grass every day, and it takes two man-days just to carry the grass every day. They came up with another way to install equipment for storing and transporting grass, so that the grass could be directly transported from the storage place to the livestock shed when needed. In this way, there is no need to carry grass every day, and two man-days can be saved every day. Approximately two thousand nine hundred man-days can be saved annually on the two jobs of carrying water and carrying grass. Investing this labor in other aspects of production will greatly increase the income of the cooperative members and accumulate wealth for society. This is something that only agricultural production cooperatives can do.

　　They adopted the method of appropriately mixing salt in the fodder (three head of livestock eat two liang of salt per day). Through experiments, they believe that appropriate salt feeding has many benefits: it can make livestock drink more water, eat more grass, can accumulate more fertilizer, and can also save materials.

　　The management committee stipulates that each cow eats three jin of cotton boll husks and two jin of sesame residue per day, mules and horses eat three jin of bran and one and a half jin of feed per day, and donkeys eat three jin of bran and one jin of feed per day. The feeders grasped the livestock's grass-eating patterns, and when mixing grass, they adhered to the principle of feeding bran in fixed quantities, adding more grass and less feed when feeding at night, and adding less grass and more feed in the second half of the night. In this way, the livestock can "eat enough, eat well, and eat cleanly."

　　On the cattle trough, each hole has an average of six cattle. After the cattle eat enough, their bellies swell, and it is very crowded to lie down. Therefore, some stand, some lie down, or one lies on the other, and the other presses on the stomach of the other, which affects the health of the livestock. In order to avoid this phenomenon, Zhao Youliang, an expert with decades of experience in feeding livestock, came up with a way: after the cattle are fed full, lengthen the reins of every other cow. For example, if there are six cattle in one hole, lengthen the reins of the second, fourth, and sixth cattle. After the livestock lie down, the first, third, and fifth are in the front row, and the second, fourth, and sixth are in the back row. After implementing this method, the health of the livestock will no longer be affected by this.

　　They adopted the method of "master teaching apprentice" to improve the skills of all feeders. Among the eleven feeders in the entire cooperative, four have higher skills (one of whom also has a rudimentary understanding of veterinary medicine, with decades of husbandry experience), and seven have poorer skills. They take meticulous care of the livestock. Zhao Youliang said: "'The fat of the livestock is the face of the feeder,' as long as the livestock eats fat, our faces will be much brighter." Zhao Youliang also taught everyone how to identify the health of the livestock, and how to treat minor illnesses. Because everyone felt that their responsibilities were heavy, those with poor skills actively learned from those with good skills, and those with high skills were also willing to teach their skills to those with poor skills. Zhang Dede's feeding skills were poor, and Zhao Youliang taught him: "To feed livestock, you must compare people to animals. When people eat, if the rice is full of lumps, they are unwilling to eat it. Livestock is the same, if the bran is not mixed evenly when mixing grass, it will be lumpy, and the livestock will definitely not eat well." Zhang Dede listened to these words, and immediately conducted an experiment, mixing the grass evenly in all four corners, without any lumps. By doing so, the livestock really ate quickly, ate deliciously, and ate cleanly. The work of feeding livestock is lighter in the first half of the night and heavier in the second half of the night. They temporarily stipulated that the apprentice feed in the first half of the night and the master feed in the second half of the night; the apprentice is young and prone to dozing off, so the master calls out and urges more often, so that the young people gradually develop good habits of feeding livestock. Whether in big or small matters, the master teaches sincerely, the apprentice learns modestly, the master loves the apprentice, and the apprentice respects the master. The husbandry group formed a harmonious and united family.

　　新绛红星农业合作社的耕畜饲养管理工作
　　阎北陵
    农业生产合作社集体饲养牲口，是一个相当复杂的工作。开始实行集体饲养时，社员们缺乏经验和习惯，牲口也改变了生活环境，很容易出毛病。牲口有了损失，就会严重地影响社的生产，因之也就会影响社的巩固。改进牲口饲养管理工作，总结这方面的经验，是十分必要的。
    山西省新绛县小聂乡红星农业生产合作社，共有一百头牲口，要耕三千二百亩土地。社内骨干和社员群众都认识到把牲口管理好饲养好是同全社的集体利益和每个社员的个人利益都有密切关系的事。管理委员会挑选了饲养技术较好、对集体利益比较关心的十一个社员，组成一个饲养组。他们还经过民主讨论，由管理委员会批准，制定了几条饲养牲口的公约：（一）四勤：勤看槽，勤添草，勤饮水，勤垫圈（一天垫两次圈，十天出一次圈）。
  （二）五要：草要铡短，水缸要满，草要筛净，槽要刷净，圈内圈外要扫净。（三）五注意：牲口下套后注意让它休息，使用以前注意饮水，注意按时喂养，注意每天检验（发现有病立即治疗），注意随时随地爱护牲口。他们还规定饲养组每七天开一次会议，检查工作，交流经验。在三个月里，饲养组取得了一些管理经验和饲养经验。
    为了细致地摸清牲口的脾气，他们把牲口分等分类，固定专人负责喂养。九头骡子，十五匹马，十四头驴，分别固定在六孔对槽上，六十二头牛固定在九孔对槽上。按照饲养员的技术特长，每两个槽固定两个饲养员，分工合作，专职饲养。牲口进圈上槽的时候，饲养员分别把它们拴在固定地位上。久而久之，使牲口养成了集体生活的习惯，进圈后都自动站在自己的地方吃草，出圈时也有次序地一个跟着一个出来。把牲口分等分类以后，避免了饥饱不匀的现象，牲口都吃肥了。如赵兰生的牛，未入社以前喂养得不好，瘦得有气无力；入社以后集体喂养，光溜溜地长了一身膘。
    社大了，牲口多了，为了便于管理，他们给每头牲口都起了个名字。骡马就按它的颜色叫“小土黄”“大青骡”“枣儿红”等等；牛就按它们角的形式和其它特点，叫“龙门角”“阴阳角”“扁担角”“地包天”等等，从河南买回来的牛就叫“河南牛”。他们做了一百个小木牌；木牌上一面写着牲口的名字，一面写着专责使用它的生产队名。木牌交给各队队长。社员们用牲口时，从队长手里拿着木牌去拉牲口。如队长分配某个社员使用“河南牛”犁地，就把“河南牛”的牌子给这个社员，这个社员就拿着这个木牌到饲养组交给值日人员，把“河南牛”检查一下有没有毛病，然后把它拉走。牛拉走后，饲养员把牲口的牌子，以队为单位，顺序挂在饲养组的有钉子的木牌上。使用牲口的人用完以后，把牲口交给饲养组，值日人员检查后，把写着这个牲口的名字的牌子仍交给这个社员拿回交给队长。“认牌子不认人”已成为使用牲口的一种制度。这样，就可以起相互监督的作用，喂养牲口的人和使用牲口的人都能爱护牲口。六队王锁稳赶车时，小鞍磨破了马的脊背，饲养组值日人员提出了意见，王锁稳不接受。饲养组把这个问题提到了管理委员会，管理委员会开会对王锁稳进行了批评。王锁稳承认了错误，并且自动地整修了小鞍。
    全社一百头牲口，每天需水二百担。饲养员为了给社里节省劳动力，开动脑筋想出了一个办法：从离饲养组近的两个井台到饲养场，分别开了两条小水渠，把饲养场的墙根底下挖了两个洞，在每个洞口里埋一个水缸。把水从井里汲上来以后，倒在小水渠里，水就流到缸里。在这两个缸的附近又设置了许多水缸，把水储存起来。找到了这个窍门，每天有两个人干这个活就足顶住八个人干这个活，一天可以节省六个人工。全社牲口每天需草一千二百斤，光每天担草就需要两个人工。他们又想出了一个办法，装置了蓄草和运草的设备，需要用草时可以使草直接由蓄草的地方运到牲口棚内。这样，就不需要每天担草了，每天又可以节省两个人工。在担水、担草两种工作上，每年大约可以节省二千九百个人工。把这些劳动力投入别的方面的生产，将会大大增加社员的收入，给社会积累财富。这是只有农业生产合作社才能办到的事。
    他们采用了在饲草中适当拌盐的办法（三头牲口每天吃二两盐）。他们经过实验，认为适当喂盐有许多好处：可以使牲口多喝水，多吃草，能多积肥，还可以省料。
    管理委员会规定：每头牛每天吃棉桃皮三斤、麻糁二斤，骡马每天吃麸三斤、料一斤半，驴每天吃三斤麸、一斤料。饲养员掌握了牲口的吃草规律，在拌草时按着定量饲养麸料的原则，每夜刚喂时多添草、少放料，后半夜少添草、多放料。这样就能使牲口“吃饱、吃好、吃了”。
    喂牛的槽上，每孔平均有六头牛。牛吃饱以后，肚子膨大，卧下去拥挤得很。因此，站的站，卧的卧，或者这个卧在那个身上，那个压住这个肚子，影响牲口健康。为了避免这种现象，有几十年的喂牲口经验的行家赵有良想出了一个办法：把牛喂饱以后，每隔一头牛把缰绳放长一些。如一孔槽上有六头牛，把第二、四、六三头牛的缰绳放长一些，牲口卧下后，第一、三、五在前一排，第二、四、六在后一排。实行这种办法以后，就再不会因此而影响牲口的健康了。
    他们采取了“师傅带徒弟”的办法，提高了全体饲养员的技术。全社的十一个饲养员中，四个人技术较高（其中一个还粗通兽医，有几十年的饲养经验），七个人技术较差。他们对牲口的爱护无微不至。赵有良说：“‘牲口的膘，饲养员的脸’，只要牲口吃的肥肥的，咱脸上就光彩的多。”赵有良还教给大家怎样识别牲口的健康，有了小病怎样医治。因为大家感到自己的责任重大，所以技术差的积极向技术好的学习，技术高的也愿意把技术教给技术差的。张德德喂养技术差，赵有良教他说：“喂养牲口要将人比畜。人吃饭时，如果饭里尽圪?，就不愿意吃。牲口也是一样，拌草时把麸料搅拌不匀，圪里圪?，牲口也一定吃不好。”张德德听了这话，当时就进行了试验，拌草时四角都拌匀，没有一点圪?。这样做，牲口果然吃得快，吃得香，吃得光。喂牲口这活前半夜工作较轻，后半夜较重。他们暂时规定：徒弟喂前半夜，师傅喂后半夜；徒弟年轻容易磕睡，师傅就勤叫唤、多督促，使年轻人逐渐养成喂养牲口的好习惯。不论在大小事上，都是师傅诚心教，徒弟虚心学，师傅爱徒弟，徒弟敬师傅。饲养组成了一个和睦团结的家庭。
