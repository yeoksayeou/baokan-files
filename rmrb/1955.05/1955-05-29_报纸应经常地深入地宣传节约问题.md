　　Newspapers Should Regularly and Deeply Publicize the Issue of Thrift
　　Liu Kai
    Thrift is the fundamental method of socialist accumulation. Practicing strict thrift is of great importance for expanding capital accumulation and accelerating China's socialist industrialization. Therefore, practicing thrift is by no means a short-term crash task, but a principle that needs to be constantly emphasized in socialist construction.
    As a tool of socialist construction, newspapers should regularly and deeply publicize the ideology of thrift and fight against all acts of wasting state resources. The Lüda People's Daily is one such newspaper that pays attention to regularly publicizing the issue of thrift. Starting from the characteristics of Lüda as an industrial city, this newspaper has, over the past year, conducted a series of publicity reports focusing on the issues of saving raw materials and rationally utilizing waste materials and substitutes in capital construction and industrial production, and has achieved good results.
    Opening up the Lüda People's Daily over the past year, what first attracts people's attention is the newspaper's publicity campaign on saving timber, which began in April 1954. Timber is one of the essential and important materials for the country's construction, and practicing strict thrift in the use of timber is of great significance. In the past, many units in Lüda City had quite serious waste phenomena in the use of timber, such as using large timber for small purposes, using long timber for short purposes, and using good timber for inferior purposes. The waste caused by non-standard timber processing was also very serious, and the timber yield was very low. This is one aspect of the problem. On the other hand, some workers with advanced ideas could not tolerate this waste of timber. The Liu Shuzhi carpentry group, an advanced group from the Third Construction Engineering Company of Lüda, was one such group. In addition to paying attention to saving timber themselves, they also proposed a proposal to the city's carpenters to save timber last spring when the city's capital construction projects were about to start in full swing. After learning about the importance of saving timber from real life, the Lüda People's Daily published the Liu Shuzhi group's initiative in the most prominent position in the newspaper and published an editorial to support it, calling on the broad masses to "save every inch of timber that can be saved for the country." Around this issue, the newspaper elaborated on the significance of saving timber, praised some units and individuals who had achieved success in saving timber, and introduced advanced experiences in saving timber and improving the timber processing yield, which greatly promoted the saving of timber in various enterprises and units. According to the statistics of only six units, such as the First Lumber Mill of the Materials Department of the Lüda Construction Engineering Bureau, from April to November 1954, over eight months, more than 9,300 cubic meters of timber were saved. This timber can be used to build 28 three-story brick-and-wood structures, each with an area of 3,000 square meters.
    Following the issue of saving timber, the Lüda People's Daily, based on the needs of actual life, successively proposed a series of issues such as "Everyone should cherish machinery and equipment," "Strive to save coal and support national industrial construction," "Actively carry out the movement to save water," "Actively save electricity for the country," and "Everyone should save steel for the country." Since March of this year, the newspaper has also opened a special column "Saving Raw Materials for the Country in All Aspects" and raised the issue of "Rationally Utilizing Waste Materials and Substitute Materials to Save Main Raw Materials for the Country," promoting more enterprises and workers to join the thrift movement. The Lüda People's Daily, focusing on the important task of practicing thrift in production, constantly discovered and raised issues from actual life, which enabled the newspaper's thrift publicity to be carried out around a certain center in each period, and achieved the regularization of thrift publicity.
    For newspapers to regularly publicize the issue of thrift does not mean that this publicity can be transactional, like a ledger reporting how much of a certain material this unit saved today, and how much of another material another unit saved tomorrow. The main task of newspapers is to regularly and deeply conduct ideological education on thrift for the masses, help people establish a solid ideology of thrift, and thus lay a solid foundation for all thrift actions. This requires newspapers to vigorously publicize the advanced people's attitude of being masters of state resources on the one hand, and vigorously criticize various erroneous ideas that hinder the implementation of the principle of thrift on the other hand. The Lüda People's Daily attaches importance to publicizing the advanced ideas of advanced people. As can be seen from the previous description, the newspaper vigorously promoted the patriotic ideology of the Liu Shuzhi group in its publicity on saving timber. Many more such examples can be found in the Lüda People's Daily. For example, the report on the Zhang Yujin group of the forging workshop of the former Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company saving raw materials on October 16, 1954, illustrates how the workers in this group tried every means in production to replace new materials with waste materials and material heads. In September 1954, they saved 40% of the materials that should have been received, and overfulfilled the production plan. The newspaper also published a commentary entitled "Promote the Spirit of Cherishing State Property," pointing out that their spirit of cherishing state property is worth learning by every worker. It is precisely because the newspaper pays attention to publicizing the advanced ideas of advanced people in its reports on thrift that these reports not only play a direct role in promoting thrift in a certain aspect, but also can have a far-reaching impact on the broad masses. For example, the newspaper's publicity on the Liu Shuzhi group's proposal to save timber not only aroused enthusiastic response among carpenters, but also among workers in other types of work in capital construction. The Zhai Guangshi stone masonry group of the First Construction Engineering Company of Lüda, learning from the spirit of thrift of the Liu Shuzhi group, saved 21,560 kilograms of cement for the country on the construction site of the Fourteenth Middle School alone.
    On the other hand, the Lüda People's Daily has fought against various ideas that violate the principle of thrift. Taking the publicity on saving coal as an example, in addition to explaining the role of coal, as an industrial food, in industrial construction, and explaining that with the development of the country's construction cause and the improvement of people's living standards, coal production cannot fully meet the needs, requiring people to save coal in all aspects to ensure the country's industrial construction, the newspaper has specifically criticized various ideas that neglect saving coal. For example, some coal-using units and residents believe that coal is a bulk commodity and the price is cheap, so burning more of it does not matter; some factory and enterprise leaders believe that coal accounts for a small proportion of the cost and is not worth managing. The newspaper sharply pointed out that not paying attention to saving coal is not a small matter, but that one does not really understand how to support the country's construction cause in specific work and daily life. The Lüda People's Daily's publicity on saving timber, saving water, electricity, and rationally utilizing waste materials and substitute materials all focus on explaining the relationship between saving these materials and national construction, while paying attention to criticizing various conservative ideas and old habits that hinder saving, in order to guide the masses to fully recognize that any waste of state resources by any enterprise or individual will weaken the material strength of national construction, delay the speed of national socialist industrialization, and is an erroneous act.
    Promoting advanced experience is an important part of the newspaper's economic publicity, and thrift publicity should also pay attention to promoting advanced experience. In addition to paying attention to conducting ideological education on thrift for the masses, the Lüda People's Daily also pays attention to promoting advanced experience in thrift, giving the masses concrete methods of thrift. For example, around the issue of saving timber, the newspaper introduced the Liu Shuzhi carpentry group's experience in extending the life of gray-coated boards (used for concrete) and preventing the use of large timber for small purposes, as well as the experience of Liang Qiwei, a carpenter from the Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory, in using a new sawing method—the "biased sawing method"—to improve the timber yield, and so on. What is particularly worth mentioning is the active and proactive spirit of the newspaper's editorial department in promoting advanced experience. On March 9th of this year, the newspaper introduced the experience of the Yu Fucheng gas group of the hull factory of the Dalian Shipbuilding Company in saving calcium carbide and oxygen. On March 12th, it also held a forum for gas welding workers from various factories to further exchange experiences in saving calcium carbide and oxygen, and disclosed the results of the forum in the newspaper to attract more people to learn from this advanced experience. In this way, the newspaper can better play an organizational role in promoting thrift experience.
    To enable the thrift movement to be carried out in depth on a normal track, newspapers must also pay attention to comprehensively publicizing the ideology of thrift. Thrift must be carried out rationally under the conditions of not reducing product and project quality, not shortening the life of lathes, machines, and buildings, and not deteriorating labor conditions. The Lüda People's Daily once clarified that only by reducing the amount of raw materials used to the lowest possible standard and making the raw materials play the greatest role under the principle of ensuring product and project quality is it correct. Deviating from this violates the correct principle. For example, on June 30, 1954, the newspaper published a commentary that sharply criticized the tendency of some construction units to blindly reduce the amount of cement used in order to save cement, resulting in the complete rework of some projects, pointing out that the thrift movement must move forward along the correct path. The newspaper pointed out that this is very important because the consequences of a one-sided view of thrift are often not real savings, but waste.
    As mentioned above, the Lüda People's Daily's publicity on the issue of thrift is relatively regular and in-depth, but this newspaper also has the shortcomings of a narrow scope in its publicity. Thrift is not only a matter for the industrial and capital construction sectors. Thrift in industrial production is not only a matter of saving raw materials, rationally utilizing waste materials and substitute materials, and cherishing machinery and equipment. However, what the Lüda People's Daily often pays attention to and impresses readers the most is mainly the publicity on saving raw materials, rationally utilizing waste materials and substitute materials, and cherishing state machinery and equipment. Taking the report on saving raw materials as an example, the waste of raw materials exists in all production links such as the planning of raw materials, the design of products or projects, and the purchase, acceptance, storage, distribution, and recycling of raw materials, while the Lüda People's Daily almost only pays attention to the link of raw material use in its reports, and does not pay enough attention to other links.
    The resolution of the National Conference of the Communist Party of China on the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy called on: "All comrades of the Party must, under the leadership of the Central Committee, unite the people of all ethnic groups in the country, work diligently, overcome difficulties, strive to increase production, practice thrift, and strive to complete and overfulfill this plan." Many newspapers have now strengthened the publicity of increasing production and practicing thrift, which is completely necessary. However, some newspapers still have the shortcomings of being fragmented, infrequent, and shallow in their publicity on the issue of thrift. In order to regularize the publicity of the issue of thrift in newspapers and go a step further, it will be beneficial to draw on the experience gained by the Lüda People's Daily in the publicity of saving raw materials.

### 报纸应经常地深入地宣传节约问题

　　报纸应经常地深入地宣传节约问题
　　刘凯
    节约是社会主义积累的根本方法。实行严格的节约，对扩大资金积累、加速我国社会主义工业化有着重大的作用。因此，实行节约绝不是一个短时期的突击任务，而是社会主义建设中需要经常注意贯彻的原则。
    报纸作为社会主义建设的工具，应当经常地深入地宣传节约思想，同一切浪费国家资财的行为进行斗争。旅大人民日报就是一个注意经常宣传节约问题的报纸。这个报纸从旅大这一工业城市的特点出发，一年来围绕着在基本建设和工业生产中节约原材料、合理地利用废料和代用品的问题，进行了一系列的宣传报道，并且收到了较好的效果。
    翻开一年来的旅大人民日报，首先引起人们注意的，是报纸从一九五四年四月开始的关于节约木材的宣传。木材是国家进行建设必不可少的重要物资之一，在使用木材上实行严格的节约有重大的意义。过去旅大市不少单位在木材的使用上却存在着相当严重的浪费现象，这就是大材小用、长材短用、优材劣用。在木材加工过程中由于不合规格而造成的浪费现象也很严重，而且出材率很低。这是问题的一方面。另一方面，有些具有先进思想的职工，则对这种浪费木材的现象表示不能容忍。旅大第三建筑工程公司的一个先进小组——刘述芝木工小组就是这样。他们除了自己注意节约木材外，并在去年春天全市基本建设工程快要全面开工的时候，向全市木工提出了节约木材的建议。旅大人民日报从现实生活中了解到节约木材的重要性后，就把刘述芝小组的倡议登在报纸的最显著地位，而且发表社论加以支持，向广大群众提出了“为国家节约每一寸可省的木材”的号召。报纸围绕着这个问题，阐述了节约木材的意义，表扬了某些节约木材获得成绩的单位和个人，介绍了节约使用木材和提高木材加工出材率的先进经验，这样就大大地推动了各个企业单位对木材的节约。仅据旅大建筑工程局材料处第一制材厂等六个单位的统计，从一九五四年四月到十一月八个月中，就节约了木材九千三百多立方公尺。这些木材可盖砖木结构的每幢面积三千平方公尺的三层楼房二十八幢。
    继节约木材问题之后，旅大人民日报又根据实际生活的需要，先后提出了“大家都来爱护机器设备”、“努力节约用煤，支援国家工业建设”、
  “积极开展节约用水运动”、“要积极为国家节约电力”、“大家都来给国家节约钢材”等一系列的问题。今年三月份以来报纸上又辟了“从各方面为国家节约原材料”的专栏，并提出了“合理利用废料和代用材料，为国家节约主要原材料”的问题，推动了更多的企业和工人卷入到节约运动中来。旅大人民日报围绕着在生产中厉行节约这个重要的工作，从实际生活中不断发现问题提出问题，这就使得报纸上的节约宣传每一时期都能围绕一定的中心去进行，做到了节约宣传的经常化。
    报纸要经常地宣传节约问题，并不是意味着这种宣传可以是事务性的，可以像流水账似地今天报道这个单位节约了某种物资多少，明天又报道另一个单位节约了某种物资多少。报纸的主要任务是经常地深入地向人民群众进行节约的思想教育，帮助人们树立起牢固的节约思想，从而为一切节约行动打下坚实的基础。这就要求报纸一方面有力地宣传先进人物对待国家资财的主人翁态度，另一方面有力地批判阻碍节约原则贯彻的各种错误思想。旅大人民日报是重视宣传先进人物的先进思想的。从前面的叙述中已经可以看出，报纸在关于节约木材的宣传中，大力地宣扬了刘述芝小组的爱国思想。这样的例子，在旅大人民日报上还可以找到很多。像一九五四年十月十六日关于前中苏造船公司锻工厂张玉金小组节约原材料的报道，就说明这个小组的工人在生产中怎样想尽各种办法以废料和料头去代替新料，一九五四年九月份竟节约了应领料的百分之四十，还超额完成了生产计划。报纸并以“发扬爱护国家财产的精神”为题发表评论，指出他们这种爱护国家财产的精神值得每一个工人学习。正是因为报纸在有关节约的报道中注意宣扬先进人物的先进思想，这些报道就不只是对某一方面的节约起了直接的推动作用，而且能够在广大群众中产生深远的影响。像报纸关于刘述芝小组节约木材倡议的宣传，不仅在木工中，同时也在基本建设其他工种的工人中引起了热烈的反响。旅大第一建筑工程公司翟光石砌石小组，学习了刘述芝小组的节约精神，仅在第十四中学一处工地上就为国家节约了水泥二万一千五百六十公斤。
    在另一方面，旅大人民日报向各种各样违背节约原则的思想进行了斗争。以节约用煤的宣传为例，报纸除了说明作为工业食粮的煤炭在工业建设中的作用，说明随着国家建设事业的发展和人民生活水平的提高，煤炭的生产还不能完全满足需要，要求人们从各方面节约用煤以保证国家的工业建设外，曾具体地批判了各种忽视节约用煤的思想。如有些用煤单位和居民认为煤是大宗货，价钱便宜，多烧点没有什么；有些工厂企业的领导者认为煤占成本的比例不大，不值得去管它。报纸尖锐地指出了不注意节约用煤并不是小事情，而是没有真正懂得在具体工作和日常生活中如何来支援国家建设事业。旅大人民日报关于节约木材、节约用水、用电和合理利用废料和代用料等的宣传，都在阐明节约这些物资对于国家建设的关系的同时，注意批判阻碍节约的各种保守思想和旧的习惯，以引导人民群众充分认识，任何企业或个人对国家资财的任何浪费，都会削弱国家建设的物质力量，延缓国家社会主义工业化的速度，都是一种错误的行为。
    推广先进经验是报纸经济宣传中的一个重要内容，节约宣传同样也应该注意推广先进经验。旅大人民日报除了注意向群众进行节约的思想教育外，还注意推广节约的先进经验，给群众以具体的节约办法。如围绕节约木材问题，报纸就介绍了刘述芝木工小组延长灰胎板（打混凝土用）寿命的经验和防止大材小用的经验，以及大连工矿车辆厂木工梁其维用新的割锯法——“偏面割锯法”提高出材率的经验，等等。特别值得提出的是，报纸编辑部对待推广先进经验的积极主动精神。今年三月九日，报纸介绍了大连造船公司船体厂于富成瓦斯小组节约电石和氧气的经验，三月十二日又召开各厂气焊工人座谈会，进一步交流了节约电石和氧气的经验，并将座谈结果在报纸上披露，以吸引更多的人来学习这一先进经验。这样，报纸在推广节约经验方面，就能更好地发挥组织作用。
    要使节约运动能够在正常的轨道上深入开展，报纸还必须注意全面地宣传节约思想。节约必须在不降低产品和工程质量，不缩短车床、机器和建筑物的寿命，和不使劳动条件恶化的条件下去合理地进行。旅大人民日报曾经阐明了只有在确保产品和工程质量的原则下，把原材料的使用量降到最低的标准，使原材料发挥最大的作用才是正确的，离开了这一点就违反了正确的原则。例如，一九五四年六月三十日，报纸就曾发表评论，尖锐地批评了有些建筑单位为了节约水泥而盲目地削减水泥使用量，致使某些工程全部返工的偏向，指出节约运动必须沿着正确的道路前进。报纸指出这一点很重要，因为片面的节约观点所造成的后果往往并不是真正的节约，而是浪费。
    如上所述，旅大人民日报关于节约问题的宣传是比较经常和深入的，但是这个报纸在宣传中也存在着范围狭窄的缺点。节约不仅仅只是工业和基本建设部门的事情。工业生产中的节约也不仅仅是节约原材料、合理地利用废料、代用料和爱护机器设备的问题。可是，旅大人民日报经常注意和给读者印象最深的，主要还是关于节约原材料、合理利用废料和代用料，以及爱护国家机器设备问题的宣传。就拿节约原材料的报道来说，原材料的浪费，是存在于原材料的计划，产品或工程的设计，原材料的采购、验收、保管、发放、回收等各个生产环节上的，而旅大人民日报在报道中，几乎只是注意了原材料使用的这一环节，对其他环节则注意得不够。
    中国共产党全国代表会议在关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案的决议中号召：“全党同志必须在中央的领导下，团结全国各族人民群众，兢兢业业，克服困难，努力增产，厉行节约，为完成和超额完成这个计划而奋斗”。不少报纸目前已加强了增产节约的宣传，这是完全必要的。但也有一些报纸，在关于节约问题的宣传上，还存在着零碎、不经常、不深入的缺点。为了使节约问题的宣传在报纸上经常化并深入一步，吸取旅大人民日报在节约原材料宣传中取得的经验将是有益的。
