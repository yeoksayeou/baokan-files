　　We are a group of young people working in the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. As youth workers, we feel extremely indignant at Hu Feng's crimes against the Party and the people. We clenched our fists as we read the batch of secret letters he wrote to Shu Wu.
　　Hu Feng has already deceived and poisoned many young people, and today we will no longer allow Hu Feng to continue his evil deeds. Hu Feng has been masquerading in the guise of Marxism for twenty years, and today is the time for him to reveal his true colors.
　　For twenty years, Hu Feng has taken advantage of the naiveté of young people, viciously deceiving them and instigating them to leave the revolution and the Party. Hu Feng has long disguised himself as a revolutionary writer, gaining the trust of young people. Some of us and many young people have been deceived by him. Even now, when people have already grabbed his fox tail, he is still trying to portray himself as merely not having clarified the difference between the working class's standpoint and "the revolutionary nature and standpoint of the petty bourgeoisie," attempting to continue to muddle through. But he cannot deceive the Party and the people. The "People's Daily's" exposure and criticism of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique has made us recognize Hu Feng's true face. He has ulterior motives. Hu Feng does not openly oppose the revolution with a gun; but it is easy to dodge a spear in the open, but hard to guard against an arrow shot in secret. Hu Feng is even more insidious than the enemy with guns. Since he is "wrapping insults in smiles" to "shake hands and make peace" with us, since he is using "a whip with steel wire wrapped in rubber to beat prisoners" to lash us, who else could this be but the most vicious enemy?
　　We young people find it difficult and incomprehensible to read Hu Feng's articles (including his "My Self-Criticism"), but reading his letters to Shu Wu is perfectly clear. It turns out that when Hu Feng speaks in his true colors, he can speak clearly.
　　We completely agree with the "People's Daily" editor's note, which points out that we must get to the bottom of Hu Feng and the Hu Feng anti-Party clique. We believe that what is invincible is Marxism-Leninism, and definitely not Hu Feng's "subjective fighting spirit." Hu Feng's true colors must be exposed, and they will definitely be exposed.
　　The "People's Daily" editor has said what we wanted to say but didn't say. There is only one way out for Hu Feng and his followers: thoroughly confess their anti-Party crimes, surrender to the people, and start anew.
　　From the exposure of Hu Feng's anti-Party crimes, we have learned a profound lesson, that is, we young people must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, improve our level of Marxism-Leninism, enhance our political vigilance, carefully sniff everything, distinguish its true from false, and strictly guard against any enemy who masquerades as a revolutionary, so that enemies appearing in any guise will not succeed.

    我们是在中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会工作的一群青年。作为青年工作者，我们对胡风反党反人民的罪行，感到极大的愤慨，我们是捏着拳头看完他写给舒芜的那一批密信的。
    胡风已经给了青年不少欺骗和毒害，今天我们再也不许胡风继续为非作歹了。胡风已经披着马克思主义的外衣鬼混了二十年，今天到了他显露原形的时候了。
    二十年来，胡风利用了青年的幼稚，恶毒地欺骗青年，教唆他们离开革命、离开党。胡风长期地把自己装扮成为一个革命作家，骗取青年的信任，我们中间的一些人和不少青年就都曾受过他的欺骗。直到现在，人们已经揪住了他的狐狸尾巴，他还竭力把自己说成只是没有弄清工人阶级立场和“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”的区别，企图继续蒙混下去。但是他是欺骗不了党和人民的。“人民日报”对胡风反党集团的揭露和批判，使我们认清了胡风的真面目，他是别有用心的。胡风不是拿起枪来公然反对革命；但是明枪易躲，暗箭难防，胡风比拿枪的敌人还阴险。既然是“用微笑包着侮蔑”来和我们“握手言欢”，既然是用“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”来鞭打我们，这除了是最恶毒的敌人，难道还有别人吗？
    我们青年看胡风的文章（包括他的“我的自我批判”）都感到吃力、费解，但看他给舒芜的信，却一目了然，原来胡风以他的真面目说话的时候，是能够说清楚他的话的。
    我们完全同意“人民日报”编者按语指出的，一定要把胡风和胡风反党集团的根底弄个水落石出。我们相信，战无不胜的是马克思列宁主义，而绝不是胡风的“主观战斗精神”。胡风的原形一定要揭露，也一定能揭露。
      “人民日报”编者说出了我们要说而没有说出的话。胡风和胡风分子的出路只有一条：彻底交代自己的反党罪行，向人民投降，重新作人。
    从揭露胡风反党罪行当中，我们得到一个深刻的教训，这就是我们青年必须认真地学习马克思列宁主义，提高自己的马克思列宁主义水平，提高政治警惕，凡事都认真嗅一嗅，辨别其真伪，严防任何混充革命者的敌人，不让以任何面目出现的敌人得逞。
