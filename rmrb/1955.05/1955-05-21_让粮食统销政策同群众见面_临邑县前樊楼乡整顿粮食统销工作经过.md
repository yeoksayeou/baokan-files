Letting Grain Unified Purchase and Sale Policies Meet the Masses
——The Process of Rectifying Grain Unified Purchase and Sale Work in Qianfanlou Township, Linyi County
Hu Guang
In the past, when Qianfanlou Township in the Seventh District of Linyi County, Shandong Province, issued grain purchase certificates, all issues were subjectively decided by district and township cadres. National policies were not presented to the masses at all. Especially when issuing the grain purchase certificates for the second quarter, the township did not announce the supply targets to the masses, nor did it announce the supply standards for various supply recipients. Instead, regardless of actual needs, certificates were given to whoever wanted them, and whoever urged the most was given priority. Furthermore, some township and village cadres had localism, which resulted in many grain purchase certificates being issued inappropriately. Those who should not have been supplied were supplied, and those who should have been supplied less were supplied more. Some bad elements seized the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, further creating a tense psychology among the peasants and affecting the progress of spring plowing and production.
In early May, the Seventh District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, began to help this township rectify grain unified purchase and sale work. However, the first problem encountered in this work was that some village cadres thought it did not matter whether the unified purchase and sale work was rectified, and the main problem was to increase the grain supply; many township and village cadres believed that this work conflicted with production and were afraid that carrying out this work would affect production; those village cadres who had irregularly issued grain purchase certificates and received extra grain purchase certificates were afraid of being criticized and punished. In this situation, it was clear that correcting the work attitude of township and village cadres and eliminating their ideological concerns became the primary condition for doing a good job in rectifying grain unified purchase and sale work. Therefore, the District Committee educated township and village cadres through meetings such as the expanded meeting of the Qianfanlou Township Branch Committee, targeting the above-mentioned ideas. First, they let the township and village cadres calculate the grain supply quantities. The original supply target for the entire township for the second quarter was 80,000 catties, which was a relatively reliable figure calculated based on the grain unified purchase situation last fall. It could have largely met the needs of grain-deficient farmers in the township, but by the end of April, this target had already been exceeded. The branch cited many facts of supplying those who should not have been supplied, making the cadres realize that the current problem was not the shortage of grain supply, but the inappropriate supply and waste of a large amount of grain. Therefore, only by carrying out a mass rectification of grain unified purchase and sale work can the problem be fundamentally solved. At the same time, only by quickly rectifying the grain unified purchase and sale work can the masses be assured of production. In order to eliminate the concern of being criticized and punished, the District Committee explained that the leadership was also responsible for the problems in the unified purchase and sale work in the past. As long as township and village cadres can correctly recognize their mistakes and are determined to correct them, they are still good cadres. After such repeated education, the township and village cadres corrected their understanding, eliminated their concerns, and were determined to do a good job in rectifying grain unified purchase and sale work. Those cadres who had committed malpractices also automatically reviewed their mistakes. In this way, each village, with township and village cadres as the backbone and the party branch as the core, carried out the rectification of grain unified purchase and sale work.
After correcting the understanding of the cadres, the masses were mobilized without restraint.
To mobilize the masses, the Party's policies must be presented to the masses. To this end, each village first vigorously publicized the grain unified purchase and sale policy through various meetings, explaining that the grain unified purchase and sale work must adhere to the principle of supplying those who should be supplied, supplying less to those who should be supplied less, and not supplying those who should not be supplied, so as to ensure supply and reduce waste of grain; the broad masses of peasants should assist the government in doing this work well. In this way, the peasants understood the state's policies and eliminated their doubts.
At the same time, the township people's government convened the township people's congress and mass meetings in various villages. At the meeting, the current unified purchase and sale situation in the township was presented, explaining to everyone that the main reason for breaking through the township's second-quarter supply target was that those who should not be supplied were supplied, and those who should be supplied less were supplied more. If this continues, a large amount of the state's grain will be sold improperly, which is not good for the state or the peasants. At the same time, township and village cadres reviewed that the unified purchase and sale work was not done well in the past, mainly because they did not rely on the masses; in order to rectify the unified purchase and sale work, everyone must clarify the “bottom line” of the township’s grain needs and determine the supply targets through democratic appraisal. This made the masses understand the reasons for the "tension" in the grain unified purchase and sale situation and deeply felt the importance of democratic appraisal. Then, each village conducted appraisals by group. During the appraisal, the masses were generally very serious. Grain-deficient households, in order to get a reasonable supply for themselves, unreservedly proposed who should be supplied and who should not be supplied; farmers who should not have been supplied but received grain purchase certificates also voluntarily reported and returned the grain purchase certificates. In Bianjia Miao Village, more than 30 farmers voluntarily reported and returned grain purchase certificates or reduced the supply quantity. Some also reviewed and said: "We cannot only care about ourselves and forget the state and grain-deficient brothers." After such democratic appraisal, the grain needs of grain-deficient households were generally clarified separately.
However, because some farmers were afraid of offending people, the appraisal was not thorough enough this time. For this reason, each village held a meeting of perennially grain-deficient households and asked them to appraise again. Because these people appraised more seriously, they appraised more accurately who should be supplied, how much should be supplied, and who should not be supplied. After such two rounds of household-by-household appraisal, each village conducted another appraisal by the branch and village administrative cadres, and then announced the appraisal results to the masses. If the masses had no objection, they were sent to the township and district for approval. Those who should be supplied were supplied in a timely manner, and those whose supply should be reduced were reduced. Individual problems in the unified purchase and sale work were solved individually.
After only six days of work in this township, the grain unified purchase and sale situation changed. With the improvement of the peasants' awareness, 191 farmers in the township returned their grain purchase certificates or reduced the amount of grain supply; at the same time, 71 households who were truly short of grain received grain purchase certificates and obtained additional supply. The cadres of Dongsunjia Miao Village reflected that it is now "three happinesses": the grain supply is reasonable, and the masses are happy; relying on the masses to do a good job in the unified purchase and sale work, the masses no longer say that there is a shortage of grain, and we are happy in our hearts; district and township cadres are also happy. The improvement of the unified purchase and sale work has also promoted the completion of spring plowing and cotton planting tasks. In the past, some farmers were afraid that the grain supply would not be timely and were unwilling to plant more cotton. Now that their concerns have been eliminated, they have actively expanded the cotton planting area.

　　让粮食统销政策同群众见面
　　——临邑县前樊楼乡整顿粮食统销工作经过
　　胡光
    山东省临邑县七区前樊楼乡过去发放购粮证时，一切问题都是由区、乡干部主观地决定，国家政策根本没同群众见面，特别是在发第二季度购粮证时，既没有向群众公布全乡的供应指标，又没有向群众公布对各类供应对象的供应标准，而是不问实际需要，谁要证就给谁，谁要的紧就先给谁。再加有些乡、村干部有本位主义思想，致使不少的购粮证发得不当，不该供应的供应了，该少供应的多供应了。某些坏分子便乘机造谣破坏，更造成了农民的紧张心理，影响了春耕生产的进行。
    五月初，中共七区区委，根据国务院和中共中央的指示，开始帮助这个乡整顿粮食统销工作。但是在这一工作中首先遇到的问题是，有些乡村干部认为统销工作整顿不整顿不关紧要，问题主要是应增加粮食供应量；还有不少乡、村干部认为这一工作同生产矛盾，怕进行这项工作会影响生产；那些有乱发购粮证和多领购粮证现象的乡、村干部，怕受批评、受处分。在这种情况下，很显然，端正乡、村干部的工作态度，消除他们的思想顾虑，就成为做好整顿粮食统销工作的首要条件。于是，区委便通过前樊楼乡支委扩大会等会议，针对上述思想对乡、村干部进行了教育。首先让乡、村干部算了粮食供应数量的账，全乡第二季度原订供应指标为八万斤，这是根据去秋粮食统购情况计算出来的比较可靠的数字，本来大体上可以满足全乡缺粮农民的需要，但到四月底止，就已超过了这个指标。支部举出了许多不该供应而供应了的事实，使干部认识到当前的问题不是粮食供应量少，而是供应不当，浪费了大量粮食，因此只有开展一次群众性的整顿粮食统销工作，才能从根本上解决问题。同时，也只有迅速地把粮食统销工作整顿好，才能使群众安心生产。为了消除那种怕受批评、受处分的顾虑，区委说明过去统销工作中存在的问题，领导方面也有责任，乡、村干部只要能够正确地认识自己的错误，决心改正，仍然是好干部。经过这样的反复教育之后，乡、村干部端正了认识，消除了顾虑，决心做好整顿粮食统销工作。那些曾犯有徇私舞弊错误的干部，也自动地检讨了自己的错误。就这样，各村以乡、村干部为骨干，以党支部为核心，开展了整顿粮食统销工作。
    端正了干部的认识以后，便放手发动群众。
    要发动群众，必须使党的政策同群众见面。为此，各村首先通过各种会议，大张旗鼓地向群众宣传了粮食统销政策，说明粮食统销工作一定要掌握该供应的一定供应，该少供应的少供应，不该供应的不供应的原则，做到既保证供应，又要减少粮食的浪费；广大农民应该协助政府做好这一工作。这样，农民了解了国家的政策，消除了疑虑。
    和这同时，乡人民政府召开了乡人民代表大会和各村群众大会。会上，把全乡当前的统销情况摆了出来，向大家说明全乡第二季度供应指标被突破的主要原因，是不该供应的供应了，该少供应的多供应了。这样继续下去，国家的大批粮食销售不当，对国家、对农民都不利。同时乡、村干部检讨了过去统销工作没做好，主要是没有依靠群众；为了整顿统销工作，必须靠大家来弄清全乡粮食需要的
  “底”，通过民主评议确定供应对象。这样使群众了解了粮食统销情况“紧张”的原因所在，深深感到民主评议的重要。然后，各村分别以组为单位进行了评议。评议时，群众一般都十分认真。缺粮户为了自己得到合理的供应，毫无顾虑地提出了谁该供应，谁不该供应；不应供应而领到了购粮证的农民，也自报退回购粮证。卞家庙村就有三十多户农民自报退回购粮证或减少供应数量。有的还检讨说：“不能只顾自己，忘了国家和缺粮兄弟。”经过这样民主评议，缺粮户的粮食需要情况大体上分别清楚了。
    但是，因为有些农民怕得罪人，这次评得还不够彻底。为此，各村又召开了常年缺粮户会议，让他们再度评议。由于这些人评得更认真，对谁该供应，谁该供应多少，谁不该供应，就评得更准确了。经过这样两次逐户评定后，各村由支部和村行政干部再评议，然后把评议的结果向群众公布，群众没有意见就送乡、区批准，应该供应的及时供应，该减少供应的就减少供应。对统销工作中的个别问题，进行个别解决。
    这个乡经过短短六天的工作，粮食统销情况改变了。在农民觉悟提高的情况下，全乡有一百九十一户农民退回了购粮证或减了粮食供应数量；同时，真正缺粮食的七十一户领到了购粮证和得到了追加供应量。东孙家庙村的干部反映，现在是“三愉快”：粮食供应合理了，群众愉快；依靠群众做好了统销工作，群众不说缺粮了，我们心里愉快；区、乡干部也愉快。统销工作的改进，也推动了春耕生产和植棉任务的完成。过去有的农民怕粮食供应不及时，不愿多种棉花，现在顾虑消除了，都积极扩大了棉花播种面积。
