　　The resource exploration work in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province has inspired the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in the Haixi Mongolian, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Region to report mineral discoveries. From April 1st to May 7th, the people of all ethnic groups in the Dulan Mongolian Autonomous Region reported more than 40 kinds of minerals. Each ore was marked with the place of origin and the name of the ore as judged by the reporter. According to preliminary tests by geologists, it is believed that it contains various minerals such as iron, coal, and lead. Many ores were personally brought by reporters on horseback from very far away. A Mongolian elder over sixty years old named La Ri Jia in the Dulan Mongolian Autonomous Region heard that the Haixi Work Group of the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee had sent people to Bayan Mountain to look for iron ore, and he volunteered to lead the way. La Ri Jia would always climb the mountain to find several stones of different colors every day. After the prospecting geologists set up their tents in a place, many people would visit the tents and hand over the minerals they found to the geologists. Once, a Mongolian woman in her forties named Bi Ti and an eleven-year-old child brought a piece of ore weighing more than four kilograms and led them to the production site to observe.

　　柴达木盆地各族人民报矿
    青海省柴达木盆地的资源勘察工作，激发了海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治区各族人民的报矿热情。四月一日到五月七日，都兰蒙族自治区各族人民报矿四十多种。每个矿石上面都记有矿石产地和报矿人自己判断的含矿名称。据地质师初步检验结果，认为其中含有铁、煤、铅等矿石多种。许多矿石是报矿者从很远的地方亲自骑马送来的。都兰蒙族自治区一个六十多岁名叫拉日加的蒙族老人，听说青海省人民委员会海西工作团派人去巴燕山找铁矿，就自动报名去领路。拉日加每天总要爬到山上找回几块颜色不同的石头。找矿的地质人员每到一个地方安下帐房后，就有许多群众到帐房去访问，把他们找到的矿石交给地质人员。有一次，一个四十多岁名叫毕提的蒙族妇女和一个十一岁的小孩，抱来一块四斤多重的矿石，并领着他们到产地去观察。
