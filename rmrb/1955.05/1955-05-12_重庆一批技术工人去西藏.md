　　The first group of 240 technical workers from Chongqing Municipality who will participate in construction work in Tibet this year departed on the 10th. These experienced technical workers, all level four or above, voluntarily signed up to go to Tibet in response to the call of the Party and the trade union organizations. Carpenter Shen Ronghua, who had just returned from participating in the construction of the Kangzang Highway, voluntarily signed up again this time. Before their departure, they received warm encouragement and farewells from their original work units. The workers' families all encouraged their loved ones to participate wholeheartedly in the work of building the frontier regions.
　　From 1953 to 1954, Chongqing Municipality successively sent more than 10,000 workers to Kangzang to participate in the construction of the Kangzang Highway and other projects. Apart from a portion who have completed their tasks and returned to Chongqing, the majority are still voluntarily staying in the Kangzang area to participate in local construction work.

　　重庆一批技术工人去西藏
    重庆市今年前往西藏参加建设工作的第一批技术工人二百四十人已经在十日出发。这批四级以上的老技术工人都是响应党和工会组织的号召自动报名去西藏的。木工申荣华参加修筑康藏公路刚回来不久，这次又自动报名前去。他们在出发前受到了原单位热烈的鼓励和欢送。工人们的家属都勉励自己的亲人安心地参加建设边疆的工作。
    重庆市在一九五三年到一九五四年期间，先后有一万多名工人前往康藏参加修筑康藏公路等工作，其中除一部分已完成任务返回重庆外，大部分仍自愿留在康藏地区参加当地的建设工作。
