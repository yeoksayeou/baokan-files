Xinhua News Agency report:

　　The ten state-owned ethnic trade stores and supply and marketing cooperative outlets in Kaili town, Lushan Miao Autonomous County, Guizhou Province, receive many customers every day. In 1954, the state-owned trade departments purchased more than 25,000 yuan worth of local and special products in the area. Salt supply and marketing stores, timber purchasing stations, People's Banks, and grain warehouses have been established in the town one after another. This has changed the past situation of salt shortages and the inability to sell local and special products in the area.
    This small town, surrounded by mountains, used to rely solely on rugged mountain roads and the swift-flowing Qingshui River to connect with the outside world. Now, a highway has been built here, and long-distance telephones have been installed. Last year, Kaili town transported more than 540,000 jin of flue-cured tobacco to Shanghai, Guiyang, and other places via this highway. The highway from Kaili to Taijiang Miao Autonomous County is now being surveyed.
    Ethnic health clinics and maternal and child health stations have been established in the town. The health clinics and health stations have trained hundreds of health workers and midwives. The whole town has twenty-one primary schools and one ethnic middle school, giving all school-age children the opportunity to study. The mountain film projection teams also come here to show films to more than 40,000 farmers.

　  贵州炉山凯里镇日益繁荣
    贵州省炉山苗族自治县凯里镇上的十个国营民族贸易商店和供销合作社门市部，每天接待着很多的顾客。一九五四年国营贸易部门在当地收购的土、特产价值二万五千多元。镇上先后建立了食盐供销店、木材收购站、人民银行和粮食仓库。改变了当地过去一向缺盐和土、特产品销售不出去的情况。
    这个被群山环抱的小镇，过去只靠崎岖的山路和急湍的清水江和外地联系。现在，这里修筑了一条公路，架设了长途电话。去年凯里镇由这条公路调运去上海、贵阳等地的烤烟就有五十四万多斤。从凯里通往台江苗族自治县的公路现又开始勘测。
    镇上建立了民族卫生所和妇幼保健站。卫生所和保健站训练了数以百计的保健员和接生员。全镇有二十一所小学和一所民族中学，学龄儿童都有了读书机会。山区电影巡回放映队还来到这里为四万多农民放映电影。　（据新华社讯）
