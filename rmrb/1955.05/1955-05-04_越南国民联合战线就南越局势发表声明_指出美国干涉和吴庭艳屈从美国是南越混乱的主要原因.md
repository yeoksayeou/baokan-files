Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 3rd: Vietnam News Agency reports: The Vietnam National United Front issued a statement on the 2nd regarding the current conflicts in South Vietnam, saying that while the people of North Vietnam were joyfully celebrating May Day in a pleasant atmosphere of economic recovery, they received news that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique was once again clashing with religious sects.

The statement pointed out: "The US imperialists' policy of interference and Ngo Dinh Diem's policy of subservience to the US are the main causes of the chaotic situation in South Vietnam and the root of the disasters suffered by the southern residents."

The statement said: "The Vietnamese people are also paying specialattention to the attitude of the French government and the French Union forces. The latter are signatories to the Geneva Accords, but during their temporary military presence in the South, they allowed the current conflict to erupt and continue, failing to fulfill their task of protecting peace, the safety and freedom of the people."

The statement said: The Vietnam National United Front expresses indignation at the actions of the US imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, and believes that the people of Vietnam will never allow the US imperialists to freely realize their conspiracies of interference and war provocation, nor will they allow Ngo Dinh Diem to continue sacrificing the lives and property of the Vietnamese people for the sake of the US imperialists. Our people must take on the task of safeguarding their vital rights.

The statement pointed out: "The true patriotic and peace-loving forces in the South, regardless of political affiliation, religious belief or ethnicity, are closely uniting and striving to oppose the US imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, in order to defend the lives and property and democratic rights of the people. They are fighting to restore normal relations between the southern and northern regions, and to establish a government that upholds peaceful unification and respects the Geneva Accords. This is the only way to eliminate the current dangerous situation."

    越南国民联合战线就南越局势发表声明
　　指出美国干涉和吴庭艳屈从美国是南越混乱的主要原因
    新华社河内三日电　越南通讯社报道：越南国民联合战线在二日就南越目前的冲突发表声明说，越南北部地区的人民在经济恢复的愉快气氛中欢欣地庆祝五一节的同时，接到了吴庭艳集团同教派又厮杀起来的消息。
    声明指出：“美帝国主义者的干涉政策和吴庭艳屈从于美国的政策是南越混乱局势的主要原因，是南部居民现在遭受的祸害的根源。”
    声明说：“越南人民也特别注意法国政府和法兰西联邦部队的态度。后者是日内瓦协定的签字者，但在他们的军队在南部临时驻扎期间，他们却让目前的冲突爆发和延续，没有完成他们保卫和平同人民的安全和自由的任务。”
    声明说：越南国民联合战线对美帝国主义者和吴庭艳集团的行为表示愤慨，并相信越南全国人民决不会让美帝国主义者自由地实现他们的干涉和战争挑衅阴谋，也决不会让吴庭艳继续为了美帝国主义者而牺牲越南人民的生命财产。我们的人民必须负起保障他们的切身权利的任务。
    声明指出：“南部真正的爱国和爱和平的力量，正不分政治关系、宗教信仰或民族密切团结起来，努力反对美帝国主义者和吴庭艳集团，来保卫人民的生命财产和民主权利。他们正在为恢复南部和北部地区之间的正常关系、为成立一个拥护和平统一和尊重日内瓦协定的政府而斗争。这是消除目前危险局势的唯一道路。”
