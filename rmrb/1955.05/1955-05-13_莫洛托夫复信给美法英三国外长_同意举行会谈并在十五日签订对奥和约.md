　　同意举行会谈并在十五日签订对奥和约
    新华社十二日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：前已报道，从五月二日起，苏联、法国、美国和英国的大使一直在奥地利代表的参加下在维也纳举行会议。这次大使会议的目的是完成草拟关于使奥地利恢复成为一个独立民主国家的对奥和约的工作，这个条约将由苏联、美国、英国和法国的外交部长以及奥地利加以审议和签字。
    鉴于大使们共同草拟和约的工作即将结束，英国驻莫斯科大使海特尔爵士五月九日把美国国务卿杜勒斯、法国外交部长比内、英国外交大臣麦克米伦的信件转交苏联外交部长莫洛托夫。上述三国的外交部长在这个信件中建议，如果一切都准备停当的话，对奥和约的签字仪式在五月十五日在维也纳举行。他们并且建议四国外交部长在五月十四日进行一次非正式会谈。
    苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在五月十日经由海特尔大使把复信交给杜勒斯、比内和麦克米伦，信中说，建议中的举行一次会议的日期是可以接受的，莫洛托夫表示他将在五月十四日到达维也纳，并且将能够参加这次非正式会谈。莫洛托夫还说，他很满意地接受三个西方国家的外交部长提出的于五月十五日在维也纳在对奥和约上签字的建议。
