　　Hu Feng and His Clique Must Thoroughly Confess
　　Liu Kaiqu
　　On the morning of May 13th, I opened the "People's Daily" and saw Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism," but after reading "Some Materials Concerning the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique," I was so indignant that I could not continue reading his so-called "My Self-Criticism."
　　Hu Feng has long been actively engaged in anti-Party activities, but he deceives people under the guise of a Marxist-Leninist and progressive writer. Hu Feng has long been actively organizing his small clique to satisfy his most despicable bourgeois personal conspiracy of "taking the world as his own responsibility," but he shamelessly promotes his own set of theories as the true theory of realistic literature. From the letters revealed by Shu Wu, written by Hu Feng himself, it can be seen that Hu Feng regards the Party, Party comrades, and progressive writers as irreconcilable enemies. This shows that the crimes committed by Hu Feng and his clique are not simply a matter of ideological errors, as he claims. For such a long-term, strategic, and resolutely anti-Party and anti-people Hu Feng and his clique, it is not a matter of simply making a few self-criticisms. The first thing to do is to thoroughly expose their reactionary crimes.
　　Hu Feng opposes writers undergoing ideological remolding, opposes literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposes the united front, and opposes the Party's leadership of literature and art. In short, he wants to form his own "kingdom" to achieve "one great will penetrating China," in order to fulfill his extremely arrogant attempt of "all things are complete in me." The root of his reactionary thought is extremely stubborn bourgeois idealism and individualism.
　　We should all learn a lesson from the exposure of the anti-Party crimes of Hu Feng and his clique, thoroughly criticize from all aspects the more or less bourgeois idealism and individualism that may remain in our thoughts, so as not to go astray. We should all seriously study Marxism-Leninism, establish a solid materialist worldview, unswervingly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and under the leadership of the Party, fight to the end for the socialist construction of our motherland.

　　胡风及其集团要彻底坦白
　　刘开渠
    五月十三日早晨，我翻开“人民日报”就看到胡风的“我的自我批判”，但等我看了“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”后，我实在愤慨得读不下他的所谓“我的自我批判”了。
    胡风长期以来积极进行反党活动，但他却以马克思列宁主义者和进步文学家的幌子欺骗人；胡风长期以来积极组织他的小集团，以图满足他的“以天下为己任”的最卑鄙的资产阶级个人阴谋，但他却无耻地宣扬自己的一套理论是真正的现实主义文艺理论。从舒芜所揭露的、胡风自己写的那些信件中可以看出，胡风把党、党的同志和进步作家看成是和他势不两立的，这说明胡风及其集团所犯罪行，已不是单纯的一个照他所说的什么思想错误的问题了。对这样长久的、有策略的、坚决反党反人民的胡风及其集团，不是什么检讨检讨就了事的问题，而首先是彻底揭露他们的反动罪行的问题。
    胡风反对作家进行思想改造，反对文艺为工农兵服务，反对统一战线，反对文艺的党的领导，总之要自成“王国”，做到“一个大的意志贯穿了中国”，以完成他的“万物皆备于我”的极端狂妄的企图。他的反动思想的根源，就是极端顽固的资产阶级唯心主义、个人主义。
    我们人人应从胡风及其集团反党罪行的揭露中取得教训，彻底从各方面批判思想中可能残存的或多或少的资产阶级唯心主义、个人主义思想，以免走上歧途。我们人人应认真地学习马克思列宁主义，建立巩固的唯物主义世界观，坚定不移地为工农兵服务，在党的领导下，为祖国的社会主义建设奋斗到底。
