　　China to Produce Automobile Instruments
　　Installation workers at the newly built Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory are intensifying equipment installation in the first workshop for toolmaking, heat treatment, and other workshops so that these workshops can begin manufacturing various tools and molds for automobile instruments in June.

　　This factory will manufacture automobile instruments for the First Automobile Works. Preparations for this production are being accelerated. A large number of Soviet drawings and materials for manufacturing automobile instruments have been shipped to the factory, and technicians are translating and compiling process procedures. A technical training class for workers specializing in the manufacturing of automobile instruments also began in late February, with lectures given by Chinese technicians and workers recently returned from the Soviet Union. Orders for the materials needed to produce automobile instruments have been placed both domestically and internationally. It is expected that China will be able to produce a complete set of automobile instruments, including speed, mileage, fuel level, and oil pressure gauges, by the second quarter of next year.

　  我国将生产汽车仪表
    新建哈尔滨电表仪器厂的安装工人正在第一厂房里加紧进行工具、热处理等车间的设备安装，以便使这些车间能在六月份开始制造生产汽车仪表时用的各种工具和模具。
    这个工厂将为第一汽车制造厂制造汽车仪表。这项生产的准备工作正加紧进行。现在大量的制造汽车仪表的苏联图纸和资料已经运到工厂，技术人员正在进行翻译和编制工艺操作规程。专门制造汽车仪表的工人技术训练班也在二月下旬开课，由新近从苏联回国的中国技术人员和工人讲课。生产汽车仪表需要的材料已向国内外订货。预计明年第二季度我国就能生产包括速度、里程、油量、油压等全套的汽车仪表。　（新华社）
