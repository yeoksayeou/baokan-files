To the Esteemed Editor and Forwarded to Film Workers:

　　I am a young Zhuang student living in the remote south of the motherland. Today, I write this letter to you with excitement and agitation. This letter represents not only myself, but also the wishes and demands of the vast Zhuang people. We ask filmmakers to shoot a film about the life of the Zhuang people, so that people all over the country can see how the liberated Zhuang people live happily under the leadership and care of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

　　The Zhuang people have a tragic past. In the past, we suffered from the oppression and exploitation of the reactionary government, and suffered from the pain of racial discrimination. However, the Zhuang people also have a glorious revolutionary tradition. More than twenty years ago, when the Seventh and Eighth Red Armies were established in the Zuoyou Rivers area, countless people rushed to this revolutionary team and participated in the revolutionary struggle. Especially after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, under the leadership of the Party, the Zhuang people organized the "Zuojiang Revolutionary Guerrilla" in the Daqingshan Mountain in the upper reaches of the Zuojiang River and persisted in fighting the enemy. At that time, the environment was difficult. They ate banana hearts and wild vegetables, and lived in caves and on big trees. In hot weather, they covered their heads with banana leaves to sleep, and in winter, they spent the night by the fire. No matter how hard the struggle was, every guerrilla was full of revolutionary optimism. After each battle, they lit a fire deep in the forest to celebrate their victory.

　　After liberation, the life of the Zhuang people has undergone fundamental changes. They have been allocated land, eliminated landlords and bullies, suppressed bandits, and established autonomous governments. Now, a vigorous mutual aid and cooperation movement has been launched, and a new atmosphere has emerged everywhere. Trains have also arrived in this remote frontier. All this is something we never dreamed of in the past. Only in the new society is it possible for the wishes of the Zhuang people for generations to come true. As an old lady said: "China has produced a Mao Zedong, and today we have obtained land and houses. We will always follow him!"

　　When people see films such as "Victory of the Inner Mongolian People," "Happy Xinjiang," "Golden and Silver Beach," and "The Caravan Comes with the Sound of Bells in the Mountains," how much they yearn for a film about the life of the Zhuang people!

　　Comrades: I sincerely hope that you can accept my suggestion and shoot a film about the life and struggle of the Zhuang people.

### 僮族人民渴望有反映自己生活的影片

　　僮族人民渴望有反映自己生活的影片敬爱的编辑同志并转电影工作者：
    我是居住在祖国遥远的南边的一个僮族青年学生，今天，我怀着兴奋和激动的心情给你们写这封信。这封信不但代表了我自己，也代表了广大僮族人民的愿望和要求。我们要求电影工作者拍摄一部有关僮族人民生活的影片，让全国人民都看到；解放了的僮族人民，怎样在共产党和毛主席领导和关怀下过着幸福的生活。
    僮族人民有悲惨的过去。过去，我们受尽了反动政府的压迫和剥削，受尽了种族歧视的痛苦。然而，僮族人民也有着光荣的革命传统。二十多年前，当红七、红八军在左右两江建立的时候，无数的人民奔向这革命的队伍，参加了革命斗争。尤其是在抗日战争胜利后，僮族人民在党的领导下，在左江上游的大青山组织了“左江革命游击队”，坚持同敌人战斗。当时，环境是艰苦的，吃的是芭蕉心和野菜，住的是山洞和大树上，热天用芭蕉叶盖住头睡觉，冬天烤火过夜。不管斗争多么艰苦，每个游击队员都充满着革命的乐观主义。每次战斗回来，他们在森林的深处，烧起火来庆祝自己的胜利。
    解放后，僮族人民的生活起了根本的变化，分得了土地，消灭了地主恶霸，剿灭了土匪，成立了自治政府。现在又开展了轰轰烈烈的互助合作运动，到处呈现出新气象，火车也开到了这遥远的边疆。这一切，是我们过去做梦也想不到的。只有在新社会里僮族人民世世代代的愿望才有可能变成了现实。正如一位老大妈所说的：“中国出了个毛泽东，我们今天得到了田地和房屋，我们要永远跟着他走啊！”
    当人们看到“内蒙人民的胜利”“欢乐的新疆”“金银滩”和“山间铃响马帮来”等影片的时候，他们是多么渴望一部有关僮族人民生活的影片啊！
    同志：我衷心希望您们能够接受我这个建议，拍摄一部有关僮族人民生活斗争的影片。
