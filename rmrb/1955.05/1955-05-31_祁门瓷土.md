　　Qimen Porcelain Clay
　　By Our Reporter Yu Ming
　　People know that the most famous specialty of Qimen County, Anhui Province, is black tea. People also know that the porcelain of Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, is the most famous porcelain in China. But few people know that the best porcelain clay for making high-quality porcelain in Jingdezhen also comes from Qimen County.
　　Qimen porcelain clay is very fine and expands very little during firing; the finished porcelain is not easily cracked, and the color and shape remain unchanged for a long time. Adding a small amount of Qimen porcelain clay to general porcelain clay can greatly increase the yield rate. This type of porcelain clay also has strong electrical resistance, making it a good raw material for manufacturing industrial porcelain.
　　Long ago, the porcelain clay here was an important raw material for Jingdezhen to manufacture high-quality porcelain. During the Qing Dynasty, someone discovered porcelain mines stretching for dozens of miles in the eastern part of Qimen, and porcelain merchants from Jingdezhen flocked here to compete for purchases. These porcelain mines gradually declined during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and their reputation was further damaged by porcelain merchants adulterating the porcelain clay. By 1948, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, production had completely ceased. After liberation, many private "porcelain clay pounding mills" gradually recovered, and a local state-owned porcelain clay factory was also established in 1952. The Qimen porcelain mine has once again become a raw material production area for high-quality porcelain in Jingdezhen.
　　With the development of China's export trade and the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for high-quality daily-use porcelain has also greatly increased. Many construction departments in China require Jingdezhen to manufacture high-quality industrial porcelain, and the demand is increasing. However, the supply of raw materials cannot meet the demand. Jingdezhen only received half of the porcelain clay it requested from Qimen in 1954. This year, the requested quantity has doubled compared to 1954. Therefore, the production of Qimen porcelain clay must be greatly increased to meet the requirements.
　　Currently, there are more than 30 discovered and mined veins in Qimen. It is estimated that 2,500 tons of porcelain clay can be produced annually, enough for more than 200 years of mining. In order to produce high-quality porcelain clay in a planned and large-scale manner, a new-style factory that uses machines to produce porcelain clay has recently been built in the mountainous area of Qimen County. This porcelain clay factory is a joint state-private enterprise. Currently, it can produce more than 40,000 catties of porcelain clay per day. After adding equipment in July, it will be able to produce 80,000 catties per day. In this way, Jingdezhen will also be able to produce a large amount of high-quality porcelain to supply export, industrial porcelain, and people's daily needs.

　　祁门瓷土
　　本报记者　于明
    人们知道，安徽祁门县最著名的特产是红茶。人们也知道，江西景德镇的瓷器是我国最著名的瓷器。可是很少有人知道，制造景德镇上等瓷器的最好瓷土，也出在祁门县。
    祁门瓷土十分细腻，烧炼时很少膨胀；成瓷后不容易裂缝，色泽和形态都经久不变。一般瓷土掺少量祁门瓷土，成品率就可以大大提高。这种瓷土耐电度也强，所以它是制造工业用瓷的好原料。
    很早以前，这里的瓷土就是景德镇制造上等瓷器的重要原料。在清代，有人在祁门东乡发现连绵几十里的瓷矿，景德镇瓷商就纷纷到这里争购。这些瓷矿在抗日战争中逐渐衰落，加以瓷商在瓷土中掺假，声名更被破坏。到国民党反动派统治时期的一九四八年，完全停止生产。解放以后，许多私营的“瓷土碓”又逐渐恢复，地方国营瓷土厂也在一九五二年建立起来。祁门瓷矿重新成为景德镇上等瓷器的原料产地。
    随着我国出口贸易的发展，人民生活水平的提高，上等的日用瓷器的需要也大大增加。我国很多建设部门要求景德镇制造品质精良的工业用瓷，也越来越多。但是原料供不应求。景德镇一九五四年要求祁门供应的瓷土只得到二分之一。今年要求供应的数量比一九五四年又增加了一倍。所以，祁门瓷土的生产必须大大提高，才能适应要求。
    现在，祁门已经发现的和正在开采的矿脉有三十多条。据估计每年可以生产瓷土二千五百吨，足供二百多年开采。为了有计划地、大量地生产优良瓷土，一个新式的用机器生产瓷土的工厂，最近在祁门县的山区里建设起来了。这个瓷土厂是公私合营的，目前每天能够生产四万多斤瓷土，到七月增添设备以后，每天将可以生产八万斤。这样，景德镇也将可以大量地生产上等瓷器，供应出口、工业用瓷和人民日常的需要了。
