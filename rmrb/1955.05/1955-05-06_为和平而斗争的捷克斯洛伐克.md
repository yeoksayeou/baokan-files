Czechoslovakia Struggles for Peace
　　By Wa. David, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czechoslovak Republic

　　In these days, the people of all nationalities of Czechoslovakia are recalling a significant anniversary. Ten years ago, when the heroic Soviet army finally defeated the Nazi army, it brought freedom to the people of all nationalities of Czechoslovakia. The crushing of the Nazi occupation forces created a historically significant opportunity for the people of Czechoslovakia. They were able to decide for themselves what path they would choose in the future. The Czechoslovak people smashed the shackles of the occupation forces and capitalism together. The economic and political status of the traitorous bourgeoisie, which had previously driven the First Republic to Munich, was also stripped away. The people have seized power. In February 1948, the Czechoslovak people swept away those who attempted to turn back the wheels of history and re-establish the capitalist system in the country. The Czechoslovak people are forging ahead to build a socialist motherland.

　　Along with the revolutionary transformation of domestic policy, Czechoslovakia also implemented a new foreign policy. It is clear that the policy of the People's Democratic Republic is fundamentally different from the policy of the bourgeois rule from 1918 to 1938, which relied on alliances with Western countries but was essentially subordinate to imperialist countries. Masaryk and Beneš had linked the fate of the Republic to France and Britain. At the same time, it was the governments of France and Britain that, during the Munich period, left us at the mercy of Nazi expansion. At that time, only the Soviet Union did not betray our people and suggested providing immediate assistance, but our traitorous bourgeoisie rejected this assistance. The Soviet Union never recognized the Munich Agreement. Throughout the war, all our hopes were pinned on the Soviet Union. Fighting alongside the Soviet people, and with their support, the Czechoslovak people began to build their new life.

　　These historical experiences have also determined the foreign policy of the Czechoslovak Republic. Klement Gottwald defined the fundamental principles of Czechoslovakia's foreign policy in 1947 as follows:

　　"The primary task of Czechoslovakia's foreign policy is to guarantee the security of the Republic and its peaceful construction."

　　The Czechoslovak Republic, relying on a strong and unbreakable alliance with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people of all People's Democratic countries, is able to guarantee the security of the Republic and its peaceful construction. Czechoslovakia's international status has been guaranteed and consolidated by the treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance signed with all countries where the people led by the Communist and Workers' Parties hold power. The purpose of Czechoslovakia's foreign policy now is, and will remain, to consolidate the alliance with all peace-loving peoples, to strengthen fraternal cooperation with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all People's Democratic countries, and to work with them to safeguard peace throughout the world and the security of all peoples.

　　The entire Czechoslovak people are watching the development of the international situation with great concern. They fully understand that in contrast to the peace policy of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, is the "policy of strength" of American imperialism. This policy of strength of American imperialism divides the world into opposing camps, creates hotbeds of war, and puts all mankind in the serious danger of a third world war.

　　One of these hotbeds of war is our Republic's western neighbor—West Germany. The ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France trampled on all solemnly signed agreements, violated the will of the people of all countries, and brazenly embarked on the road of remilitarizing West Germany and establishing a new Nazi Wehrmacht. They are restoring the strength of the main enemies of the Czechoslovak people and the people of all European countries, namely the German militarism that brutally ravaged Czechoslovakia and Europe during the Second World War. After the bankruptcy of the "European Defence Community," Western politicians came up with the Paris Agreement, which stipulates that the Ruhr giants who manufacture munitions and the Nazi generals are free to act, and that West Germany will once again become a commando against the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries.

　　It is quite clear that the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreement will make it impossible to unify Germany on a democratic basis. On the contrary, it greatly increases the danger of war in Europe and primarily threatens the security of the countries neighboring West Germany, that is, the security of the Czechoslovak Republic.

　　The people of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia are very clear about the truth of these matters. Our people welcome the Moscow European countries' conference to discuss guaranteeing peace and security in Europe. The Eight-Government Declaration, unanimously approved by the delegations of the participating countries and supported by the People's Republic of China, is a plan to guarantee the security of the peoples of all countries, to prevent the instigation of a world war, and a new step in the struggle to guarantee peace in Europe and the world.

　　The Czechoslovak people are fully aware of their responsibility to the socialist, democratic, and peace camp, not only because Czechoslovakia is a member of the peace camp, but also because of its geographical location in this camp. Czechoslovakia is the westernmost outpost of the peace camp. Therefore, defending Czechoslovakia's borders also means defending the western line of the peace camp.

　　Czechs and Slovaks will not sit idly by and watch the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Faced with the serious danger of restoring the new Nazi Wehrmacht, Czechs and Slovaks will, together with the people of all peace-loving countries, respond to the threat to the motherland with the most resolute will, and will not allow any aggressor to dare to stretch out the claws of aggression towards Czechoslovakia's borders. Czechoslovakia signed the Moscow Declaration with a proud heart. The declaration states that the participating countries have a responsibility, when the Paris Agreement is ratified, to implement "common measures in the organization of armed forces and command, and also to take other measures necessary to strengthen their defense capabilities, in order to guarantee the peaceful labor of their people, to guarantee the inviolability of their borders and territory, and to guarantee the repulsion of possible aggression." The borders of Czechoslovakia are inviolable, and we must maintain their inviolability.

　　The Czechoslovak people are closely watching the development of events in the Far East. American imperialists are establishing another new hotbed of world war there. We are also vigilantly watching the conspiracies of the American aggressors in the Far East. The Czechoslovak people celebrated the victory of the Chinese people's revolution with excitement, and they also celebrated every construction achievement of the new China with equal excitement. When the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers repelled the barbarous aggression of imperialism, the Czechoslovak people stood with them. The Czechoslovak people also celebrated the victory of the Vietnamese people's liberation struggle with praise and sympathy. The people of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia clearly understand how significant the People's Republic of China is for consolidating peace in the Far East and the world. The Czechoslovak government has repeatedly stated that the great Chinese people should be recognized as having their due legitimate status in the United Nations and in international affairs. At the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Czechoslovak delegation stated:

　　"Until the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China are restored in the United Nations, the United Nations cannot satisfactorily resolve the various pressing issues that the people of the whole world are looking forward to resolving... The current situation is not only an insult to the great and heroic Chinese people, but first and foremost creates a serious obstacle to the smooth work of the United Nations."

　　This is the belief of the entire Czechoslovak people. We will never give up this belief.

　　The people of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia tirelessly pay attention to and watch the development of the European and world situation with great vigilance. They condemn all aggressive acts by the enemies of peace.

　　All the strength of the Czechoslovak people has been mobilized to consolidate world peace and ensure the security of all peoples. Czechoslovakia's main contribution to the cause of the struggle for peace will continue to be strengthening its economic and defense strength. Klement Gottwald's famous saying, "Participating in the construction of the motherland is consolidating peace," has become the motto of the Czechoslovak Peace Defense Committee and the entire people. This saying is being turned into action every day in factories, mines, and fields. The Czechoslovak people, with the help of their Soviet friends and under the leadership of the glorious Czechoslovak Communist Party, have achieved great achievements, basically completed the socialist industrialization of the country, ensured the leading position of socialist elements in all economic sectors, strengthened the unity of the people, consolidated the worker-peasant alliance, and strengthened our people's democratic state. This guarantees the independence and autonomy of the Republic, so that it will never act as a pawn in the hands of foreign monopoly capital. The fate of the Republic will no longer depend on Paris or Munich; it can only depend on Czechoslovakia, Prague, and all the working areas of the Republic.

　　The glorious ten-year history of free Czechoslovakia proves that the Czechs and Slovaks are advancing along the correct path of building socialism. They continue to advance along this avenue, regardless of all the conspiracies of world imperialism, and will certainly achieve the goal of victory. The friendship of the great Chinese people is a strong support for the Czechoslovak people on the road to building socialism. We will always cooperate with the Chinese people in friendship and be linked together by the common ideals of socialism, democracy, and peace. This friendship will develop and deepen in practical action and will bring benefits to our two countries. The political, economic, cultural, and scientific cooperation between Czechoslovakia and China not only means the further close friendship between the people of the People's Republic of China and the people of the Czechoslovak Republic, but also means a great strengthening of the world peace camp.

　　为和平而斗争的捷克斯洛伐克
　　捷克斯洛伐克共和国外交部长　瓦·戴维
    在这些日子里，捷克斯洛伐克各族人民回忆着具有重大意义的周年纪念日。十年前，当英勇的苏军最后击溃纳粹军队之后，给捷克斯洛伐克各族人民带来了自由。由于粉碎了纳粹占领军，就给捷克斯洛伐克各族人民创造了具有历史意义的时机。他们能够自己决定他们将来选择什么道路了。捷克斯洛伐克人民把占领军和资本主义的枷锁一起打碎。以前把第一共和国驱向慕尼黑的卖国资产阶级的经济地位和政治地位也被剥夺了。人民已经掌握了政权。一九四八年二月，捷克斯洛伐克人民扫除了那些企图扭转历史车轮并重新在国内建立资本主义制度的分子。捷克斯洛伐克人民勇往直前地建设社会主义祖国。
    随着对内政策的革命的转变，捷克斯洛伐克也同时实施了新的对外政策。很明显地，人民民主共和国的政策，和一九一八到一九三八年间资产阶级统治时期依靠同西方国家的联盟、而实质上却从属于帝国主义国家的政策是截然不同的。马萨里克和贝奈斯曾把共和国的命运同法国和英国联结在一起。同时，正是法国和英国的政府，在慕尼黑时期，使我们听任纳粹的扩张。当时，只有苏联一个国家没有出卖我国人民，并建议立刻给以援助，但是我们的卖国的资产阶级却拒绝了这个援助。苏联是从未承认慕尼黑协定的。在整个战争期间，我们的一切希望都寄托于苏联。和苏联人民并肩作战，并且在苏联人民的支持下，捷克斯洛伐克人民开始建设自己的新生活。
    这些历史经验也确定了捷克斯洛伐克共和国的对外政策。克利门特·哥特瓦尔德在一九四七年曾这样确定了捷克斯洛伐克对外政策的根本方针：
      “捷克斯洛伐克外交政策的首要任务是保证共和国的安全和它的和平建设。”
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国倚靠着同苏联、中华人民共和国以及同各人民民主国家人民的坚强而牢不可破的联盟，是能够保证共和国的安全和它的和平建设的。捷克斯洛伐克的国际地位，由于同各国——这些国家都是由共产党和工人党所领导的人民掌握着政权——签订的友好合作和互助条约而获得了保证并巩固起来。捷克斯洛伐克对外政策的目的现在是、今后仍然是巩固同爱好和平的各国人民的联盟，加强同苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家的兄弟般合作，并和它们一起努力保障全世界的和平和各国人民的安全。
    捷克斯洛伐克全体人民以极大的关心注视着国际局势的发展。他们完全了解，同苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的和平政策相对立的是美帝国主义的
  “实力政策”。美帝国主义的这种实力政策把世界分成了对立的营垒，制造战争策源地，并使全人类面临第三次世界大战的严重危险。
    这些战争策源地之一就是我们共和国西部的近邻——西德。美、英、法三国的统治集团践踏所有庄严签订的协定，违反各国人民的意志，悍然走上了使西德重新军国主义化和建立新纳粹国防军的道路。它们正在恢复捷克斯洛伐克各族人民和欧洲各国人民主要敌人的力量，即在第二次世界大战时曾经惨酷地蹂躏了捷克斯洛伐克和欧洲的德国军国主义。在“欧洲防务集团”破产之后，西方的政客们又搞了一个巴黎协定，这个协定规定使那些制造军火的鲁尔巨头们和纳粹将军们自由行动，并使西德重新成为反对苏联和反对所有爱好和平国家的突击队。
    十分显然，巴黎协定的批准及其实施，是不可能在民主基础上统一德国的，反而大大地增加了欧洲的战争危险并且首先威胁着邻近西德的国家的安全，也就是威胁着捷克斯洛伐克共和国的安全。
    捷克斯洛伐克各族人民，对于这些事情的真象是很清楚的，我国人民欢迎讨论保障欧洲和平和安全的莫斯科欧洲国家会议。与会各国代表团一致赞同的并为中华人民共和国所支持的八国政府宣言是保障各国人民安全、防止挑起世界战争的计划以及为保障欧洲与全世界和平而斗争的新步骤。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民完全意识到自己对于社会主义、民主、和平阵营的责任，这种责任不仅由于捷克斯洛伐克是和平阵营的一员，而且也由于它在这个阵营中所处的地理位置。捷克斯洛伐克是和平阵营西部的最前哨，因此，保卫捷克斯洛伐克的国境，也就意味着保卫和平阵营的西线。
    捷克人和斯洛伐克人将不会坐视巴黎协定的实现。面临着恢复新纳粹国防军的严重危险，捷克人和斯洛伐克人将同所有爱好和平的各国人民在一起用最坚决的意志来回答对祖国的威胁，并且不让任何一个侵略者敢于向捷克斯洛伐克的国境伸出侵略的魔手。捷克斯洛伐克带着骄傲的心情签署了莫斯科宣言，宣言声明与会各国在巴黎协定竟然批准的时候，有责任实现“在组织武装力量和司令部方面采取共同措施，并且还要采取加强它们国防力量所必需的其他措施，以保障它们人民的和平劳动，保证它们国境和领土的不可侵犯性，保证击退可能发生的侵略。”捷克斯洛伐克的国境是不容侵犯的，我们也一定要保持它的不可侵犯性。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民十分密切地注视着远东事件的发展。美帝国主义者正在那里建立着另一个新的世界大战的策源地。我们同时也警惕地注视着美国侵略者在远东的阴谋诡计。捷克斯洛伐克人民兴奋地庆贺了中国人民革命的胜利、也同样兴奋地庆贺着新中国的每一项建设成就。当朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军击退帝国主义的野蛮侵略的时候，捷克斯洛伐克人民是和他们在一起的。捷克斯洛伐克人民也以赞颂和同情的心情来庆祝越南人民解放斗争的胜利。捷克斯洛伐克各族人民清楚地懂得，中华人民共和国对于巩固远东和世界的和平有着多么巨大的意义。捷克斯洛伐克政府已经多次地表示过，伟大的中国人民在联合国中和在国际事务中应该被承认有它应有的合法地位。在联合国第九届大会上，捷克斯洛伐克代表团曾经声明：
    “在还没有恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利以前，联合国就不可能满意地解决各种迫切的问题，而这些问题是全世界的人民都在期待着解决的……当前的情况不仅是对伟大而英勇的中国人民的侮辱，而且首先给联合国的顺利工作造成严重的障碍。”
    捷克斯洛伐克全体人民的信念就是这样的。我们永远也不放弃这种信念。
    捷克斯洛伐克各族人民不倦地注意着并且以极大的警惕注视着欧洲和世界局势的发展。他们谴责和平敌人的一切侵略行为。
    为了巩固世界和平和保证各国人民的安全，捷克斯洛伐克人民的一切力量已经动员起来。捷克斯洛伐克人民在为和平而斗争的事业中的主要贡献，今后仍然是加强经济力量和国防力量。克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的“参加祖国建设就是巩固和平”的名言，已经成为捷克斯洛伐克保卫和平委员会及全体人民的座右铭了。这句名言在工厂、矿山中，在田野间，每天都在变成行动。捷克斯洛伐克人民，在苏联朋友的帮助下，在光荣的捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，已经取得了很大的成就，基本上完成了国家的社会主义工业化，在一切经济部门中保证了社会主义成分的领导地位，加强了人民的团结一致，巩固了工农联盟，并加强了我们的人民民主国家。这样就保证了共和国的独立和自主，使它永远也不会充当外国垄断资本手中的走卒。共和国的命运再也不会取决于巴黎或者是慕尼黑了，它只能取决于捷克斯洛伐克、布拉格和共和国的一切劳动地区。
    自由的捷克斯洛伐克的光荣的十年历史，证明了捷克人和斯洛伐克人是沿着建设社会主义的正确道路前进的。他们不顾世界帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计而沿着这条大道继续前进，并一定达到胜利的目的。伟大的中国人民的友谊，就是捷克斯洛伐克人民在建设社会主义道路上的有力支持，我们要永远和中国人民友爱合作，以社会主义、民主和和平的共同思想联结在一起。这种友谊将在实际行动中日益发展和加深起来，并将给我们两国带来好处。捷中两国政治、经济、文化和科学的合作，不仅意味着中华人民共和国人民和捷克斯洛伐克共和国人民的进一步的亲密友好，而且也意味着世界和平阵营的大大加强。
