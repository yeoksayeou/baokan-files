　　Enhance the Role of Waterwheels and Wells in Increasing Agricultural Production
　　Chang Huamin
    Waterwheels and wells are an important irrigation facility for eliminating the threat of drought and ensuring stable and high yields of grain and cotton in a large part of northern China. The development prospects of waterwheels and wells are quite broad. Hebei Province is the most developed region for water well and waterwheel irrigation, but there are still more than forty counties in the province with a large area lacking surface water sources but having good groundwater sources, making it possible to develop water well irrigation. In Dingxing, Xushui, and other five counties of this province, the existing water well irrigation area only accounts for about one-sixth of the area suitable for well drilling. In addition, the potential of existing water wells and waterwheels is also very large. According to reports, in Henan Province alone, as long as the management of existing water wells and waterwheels is strengthened, the irrigated area can still be expanded by 1.5 million mu. This shows that strengthening the leadership of water well and waterwheel irrigation work can expand the irrigated area.
    However, at present, some cadres and farmers have some incorrect views on waterwheels and wells. They are afraid that drilling wells will affect the future implementation of mechanized farming, and they think that waterwheels and wells are outdated, so they are willing to build pumping stations or drill machine wells. This understanding is a major obstacle to expanding the area of water well and waterwheel irrigation.
    Will drilling wells affect mechanized farming? If the well spacing is too dense, it will be unfavorable to the future implementation of mechanized farming. But if we can guide farmers to drill wells in a planned way, appropriately increase the well spacing, increase the water output per well, and expand its irrigation area, then the problem of affecting mechanized farming can be solved. Establishing pumping stations or drilling machine wells is certainly a good way to develop water conservancy and irrigation, but current conditions should be considered. The cost of drilling machine wells is very high. The machine wells trial-drilled in Raoyang County, Hebei Province in 1954 cost 31,000 yuan each, irrigating 350 mu of land, with an average investment of more than 88 yuan per mu. This is more than six times higher than the average investment per mu for drilling an ordinary well (including a conical well) and installing a waterwheel locally. The cost of drilling machine wells is so high that most agricultural production cooperatives cannot afford it. Looking at the production of water pumps and power fuel, it is also difficult to establish a large number of pumping stations. Therefore, under the current conditions, it is completely wrong to think that waterwheels and wells are outdated and to ignore their role in increasing agricultural production. In this year's task of building farmland water conservancy in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces, the task of expanding the area of water well irrigation accounts for about 52 percent. These areas should pay special attention to educating cadres and farmers to overcome the erroneous idea of ​​ignoring water wells and waterwheels, and complete the task of expanding the area of ​​waterwheel and waterwell irrigation.

　　发挥水车水井对农业增产的作用
　　常化民
    水车水井是我国北方很大一部分地区消除旱灾威胁，保障粮棉丰产稳收的一项重要灌溉设施。水车水井的发展前途是相当广阔的。河北省是水井水车灌溉最发达的地区，但全省还有四十多个县有很大面积是地上水源缺乏，地下水源良好，可以发展水井灌溉。这个省的定兴、徐水等五县现有水井灌溉面积只占适宜打井面积的约六分之一。另外，现有的水井水车潜力也很大。据了解，仅河南一省，只要加强对现有水井水车的管理，就尚可以扩大灌溉面积一百五十万亩。由此可见，加强对水井水车灌溉工作的领导，就可以扩大灌溉面积。
    但是，目前有些干部和农民对水车水井却存在一些不正确的看法，他们害怕打井会影响将来实行机器耕作，认为水车水井是过时的东西，因而愿意办抽水机站或打机井。这种认识是目前扩大水井水车灌溉面积的一个主要障碍。
    打井是否会影响机器耕作呢？如果井距过密，对将来实行机器耕作是不利的。但如果能领导农民有计划地打井，适当放大井距，增加单位井的出水量，扩大它的浇地面积，那末，影响机器耕作的问题就可以解决。建立抽水机站或打机井，当然也是发展水利灌溉的好办法，但应考虑到当前的条件。打机井的成本很高，河北省饶阳县一九五四年试打的机井，每眼成本合三万一千元，浇地三百五十亩，每亩平均投资达八十八元多。比当地打一眼普通井（包括锥井）和安装一部水车每亩平均投资高六倍多。打机井的成本这样高，这是一般农业生产合作社举办不起的。再就抽水机和动力燃料的生产上看，要建立大量抽水机站也是有困难的。因此，在目前条件下，认为水车水井已经过时，忽视它对农业增产的作用，是十分错误的。今年山东、河南、河北、山西、陕西五省兴修农田水利的任务中，扩大水井灌溉面积的任务约占百分之五十二。这些地区应特别注意教育干部和农民克服忽视水井水车的错误思想，完成扩大水车水井灌溉面积的任务。
