Xinhua News Agency Report:

The preparatory committee for the First National Workers' Games was established in Beijing on the 6th and held its first committee meeting, deciding to hold the "First National Workers' Games" in Beijing in October this year. The meeting elected Lai Ruoyu as the chairman of the Games Preparatory Committee, and Cai Shufan, Zhang Ze, Teng Daiyuan, Chen Yu, Li Dequan, Liu Ziju, and Li Zaiwen as vice-chairmen.

The Games Preparatory Committee announced the "Competition Regulations for the First National Workers' Games" on the 10th. The general principles of the regulations stipulate that the purpose of this Workers' Games is to review the achievements of the national workers' sports movement in the past six years, further promote the development of workers' sports, enhance workers' physical fitness, cultivate workers' excellent qualities of courage, perseverance, resourcefulness, and collectivism, and better serve the country's economic construction and national defense construction.

The regulations stipulate that the participating units in the Games are seventeen units including railways, coal mines, First Machine Building, Second Machine Building, heavy industry, textile, postal and telecommunications, electricity, highway transportation, seamen, construction, shop employees, education, light industry, agriculture and water conservancy, forestry, and the People's Bank of China. Each unit should combine its own actual situation, extensively carry out mass sports competitions, and adopt different methods to select the best athletes from bottom to top as representatives to participate in the Games. The regulations stipulate that the competition events of the Games include: men's and women's track and field, cycling, basketball and volleyball, as well as men's football and weightlifting. The regulations also stipulate other specific issues related to the Games' competition.

Xinhua News Agency, May 10th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League jointly issued a call to workers across the country on the 10th, in order to welcome the First National Workers' Games scheduled to be held in the capital this October, "Carry out sports competitions, and strive to enhance workers' physical fitness and improve labor productivity."

The call pointed out: In recent years, following Chairman Mao's instruction of "Develop sports and enhance the people's physique," under the leadership of people's governments at all levels, sports have developed rapidly among the working masses, and have played and are playing an active role in improving the health of the working masses, improving labor productivity, enriching the spare-time cultural life of the working masses, and uniting and educating the working masses to complete and over fulfill national plans. However, it should be pointed out that the development of workers' sports is far from universal and in-depth. To solve this problem, in addition to carrying out regular propaganda and organizational work, carrying out sports competitions is one of the important ways to promote sports. In order to give full play to the active role of sports competitions in sports work, review the achievements of the national workers' sports movement in the past six years, and further promote the development of workers' sports, the Preparatory Committee for the First National Workers' Games has decided to hold the "First National Workers' Games" in Beijing in October this year.

The call said: In order to ensure the success of this Games, all units should combine their own specific conditions and do a good job in selection through mass sports competitions. In the selection process, attention should be paid to doing a good job of propaganda and education to the athletes, so that each athlete clearly recognizes the significance and purpose of holding this Games, as well as the sports skills and new sports ethics that an athlete should have. At the same time, attention should be paid to publicizing the role of sports in physical health, production construction, and national defense construction to the broad masses of workers through sports competitions, and tell them the methods and common sense of physical exercise, so as to attract the broad masses of workers to actively participate in sports and expand the mass nature of sports. Through mass sports, improve the health of workers, carry out communist education to the working people, and cultivate workers' excellent qualities of courage, perseverance, resourcefulness, optimism, diligence, and collectivism.

The call concluded by saying: The holding of the "First National Workers' Games" is a practical reflection of the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the working class in our country, and a manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system of the People's Republic of China over the old China. It will play an important role in the country's economic construction and national defense construction. We call on workers, engineers, technicians, and staff members across the country to actively participate in physical exercise and competition activities in order to enhance physical fitness, improve labor productivity, and strive for excellent achievements in labor and sports.

    据新华社讯　全国第一届工人体育运动大会筹备委员会六日在北京成立并举行了第一次委员会议，决定今年十月在北京举行“全国第一届工人体育运动大会”。会议推选赖若愚为大会筹备委员会主任委员，蔡树藩、章泽、滕代远、陈郁、李德全、刘子久、栗再温为副主任委员。
    大会筹备委员会十日公布了“全国第一届工人体育运动大会竞赛规程”。规程的总则确定这次工人体育运动大会的宗旨是：检阅六年来全国职工体育运动的成绩，进一步推动职工体育运动的开展，增强职工体质，培养职工勇敢、坚毅、机智和集体主义的优良品质，更好地为国家经济建设和国防建设服务。
    规程规定：参加大会的竞赛单位为铁路、煤矿、第一机械、第二机械、重工业、纺织、邮电、电业、公路运输、海员、建筑、店员、教育、轻工业、农业水利、林业和中国人民银行等十七个单位。每个单位应结合本单位的实际情况，广泛开展群众性的竞赛活动，采用不同的办法，自下而上地选拔成绩最好的运动员作为代表参加大会。规程规定了大会的竞赛项目有：男、女田径，自行车和篮、排球以及男子足球和举重。规程还规定了其他有关大会竞赛方面的具体问题。
    新华社十日讯　中华全国总工会和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会为迎接定于今年十月在首都举行的全国第一届工人体育运动大会，在十日联合向全国职工发出“开展运动竞赛，为增强职工体质，提高劳动生产率而努力”的号召。
    号召中指出：几年来，遵循着毛主席“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的指示，在各级人民政府的领导下，体育运动在工人群众中有了迅速的发展，对改善职工群众的健康状况，提高劳动生产率，丰富职工群众的业余文化生活，团结教育职工群众完成和超额完成国家计划等方面，已经起了并正在起着积极的作用。但应当指出，目前职工体育运动开展的远不普及，不深入。要解决这一问题，除了进行经常的宣传工作和组织工作外，开展运动竞赛是推动体育运动的重要方式之一。为了充分发挥运动竞赛在体育工作中的积极作用，检阅六年来全国职工体育运动的成绩，进一步推动职工体育运动的开展，全国第一届工人体育运动大会筹备委员会已定于今年十月在北京举行“全国第一届工人体育运动大会”。
    号召中说：为了保证开好这次运动大会，各单位应结合自己的具体情况，通过群众性的运动竞赛活动作好选拔工作。在选拔过程中，应注意向运动员作好宣传教育工作，使每个运动员明确认识举行此次运动大会的意义和目的，以及一个运动员应具有的运动技能和新的体育道德。同时应注意通过运动竞赛向广大职工群众宣传体育运动对身体健康、生产建设和国防建设的作用，告诉他们进行体育锻炼的方法和常识，从而吸引广大职工群众积极参加体育运动，扩大体育运动的群众性。通过群众性的体育运动以改善职工健康状况，向劳动人民进行共产主义教育，培养职工勇敢、坚毅、机敏、乐观、勤劳等优良品质和集体主义精神。
    号召中最后说：“全国第一届工人体育运动大会”的举行，是我国工人阶级的物质、文化生活水平不断提高的实际反映，是中华人民共和国国家制度优越于旧中国的表现。它将对于国家经济建设和国防建设事业起着重要的作用。我们号召全国工人、工程技术人员和职员积极地参加体育锻炼，参加竞赛活动，以增强体质，提高劳动生产率，为在劳动和体育运动方面争取优良的成就而斗争。
