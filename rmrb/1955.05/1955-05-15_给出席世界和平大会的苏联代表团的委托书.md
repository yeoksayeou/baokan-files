The representatives of the Fifth All-Union Conference for the Defense of Peace, meeting in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, extend their greetings to the World Peace Congress and welcome the initiative of the World Peace Council in convening this international conference of representatives of peace forces from around the world.

People from most countries of the world, of various nationalities and with various political views and religious beliefs, will gather in Helsinki. This gathering is convened precisely when the threat to peace and the security of nations is increasing in Europe, Asia, the Near East, and other parts of the world. Disregarding the will of the peoples, aggressive blocs are openly preparing for atomic war; they have secured the ratification of the Paris Agreements and are now embarking on the reconstruction of the German Wehrmacht. The United States is establishing aggressive military blocs in all parts of the world and establishing its military bases everywhere. The forces of war are attempting to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Germany and Korea, disregarding the will of the German and Korean peoples. The agreements reached at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina are under threat. Tensions persist in the Taiwan area.

The United Nations, established to maintain and consolidate peace, has failed to fulfill its basic task—to save the peoples from the threat of a new war. The American aggressive bloc, which controls the majority in the United Nations, has rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude an international agreement on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and refuses to recognize the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

The instigators of a new world war continue to pursue a policy of using force in international relations. This policy can only lead to new destructive wars. Peace-loving people condemn this policy. They see that there are other ways to resolve international disputes. The results of the Soviet-Austrian negotiations, Zhou Enlai's statement that the Chinese government is willing to negotiate with the United States to ease the situation in the Far East, and the results of the Asian-African Conference all prove that it is practically possible to further ease the international situation as long as the governments of the countries concerned are willing to resolve international issues through negotiation and the conclusion of agreements.

In this situation, the active struggle of the people of all countries to defend peace is of paramount importance.

The unwavering will of the people of all countries to defend the cause of peace is manifested in the continuous development of the peace movement, which now involves many billions of people, and the universal hatred of the people of all countries for the policy of preparing for atomic war.

At present, all countries are extensively launching a signature campaign for the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World" against the preparation for atomic war. This "Appeal to the People of the World" has received the full support of all Soviet people—loyal and steadfast fighters for peace.

The Soviet people fully support and endorse the peaceful policy of the Soviet government aimed at easing international tensions, safeguarding universal security, and promoting cultural and economic cooperation among countries.

The Fifth All-Union Conference for the Defense of Peace, expressing the will of all peace-loving Soviet people, entrusts the delegates elected to attend the World Peace Congress:

	I. To assure all participants of the World Peace Congress that the Soviet people will resolutely and unswervingly strive to consolidate international peace, to ease international tensions, and to peacefully resolve all disputes on the basis of mutual consultation among the parties concerned. Believing in its own strength, relying on the unbreakable unity of the entire nation, the Soviet Union is full of determination to stop a new world war. As always, the people of all countries regard the Soviet Union as a solid and unbreakable fortress in the struggle for peace and progress.

	II. To reiterate that the Soviet people insistently demand that all countries immediately cease the production of atomic weapons and destroy all stockpiles of atomic weapons, and unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction, while establishing effective international supervision to ensure the implementation of the ban.

The Soviet people believe that as one of the initial measures to ban atomic weapons, it is necessary to first prohibit the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Proceeding from the interests of international cooperation, the Soviet Union is prepared to share its experience in the research of peaceful uses of atomic energy with other countries. Atomic energy should only be used to promote human progress and prosperity. The Soviet people advocate that the arms race must be terminated and the issue of general reduction of armaments must be resolved immediately.

	III. To declare that the Soviet people support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence announced by the Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India, and endorsed by many other countries. These five principles are: mutual respect for territorial sovereignty; non-aggression; non-interference in internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence.

	IV. To reiterate that the Soviet people, like the people of all European countries, believe that the revival of German militarism is a threat to peace. They advocate a peaceful solution to the German problem and support the establishment of a collective security system that can guarantee peace and the sovereignty of all European countries, large and small.

	V. To express deep sympathy to the people of Asian and African countries who are fighting for freedom and independence. The resolutions of the Asian-African Conference and the Asian countries' conference on easing international tensions embody the will of the people of Asia and Africa.

	VI. To declare that the Soviet Union advocates the establishment and expansion of economic and cultural ties among countries to the greatest possible extent, and advocates the elimination of all obstacles and restrictions created by groups obsessed with continuing the Cold War in order to hinder such ties.

	VII. The Congress instructs the Soviet delegates to establish close ties and active cooperation with all participants of the Congress who are concerned with maintaining and consolidating peace, regardless of their nationality, political and religious views, social status, and party affiliation, because only the unity of all peace-loving people can stop a new destructive war.

We, the representatives of the Fifth All-Union Conference for the Defense of Peace, express our deep conviction that the World Peace Congress held in Helsinki will be a major contribution to the cause of ensuring lasting peace and peaceful cooperation among nations.

The people of all countries can and should shatter the plans of the aggressors. The people of all countries have enough strength to win the victory of the cause of peace.

### 给出席世界和平大会的苏联代表团的委托书

　　给出席世界和平大会的苏联代表团的委托书
    我们在苏联首都莫斯科开会的第五届全苏保卫和平大会的代表向世界和平大会表示欢迎召开这次全世界和平力量代表的国际会议的世界和平理事会的创议。
    从全世界大多数国家来的、各个民族和具有各种政治观点和宗教信仰的人们将在赫尔辛基聚会。这次聚会是正当在欧洲、亚洲、近东以及世界其他地区，对和平和各国人民安全的威胁加重了的时候召开的。侵略集团不顾各国人民的意志，公开地在准备原子战争，他们已使巴黎协定得到批准，现在正在着手重建德国国防军。美国在全世界各个部分建立起侵略性的军事集团，到处建立自己的军事基地。战争的势力不顾德国人民和朝鲜人民的意志企图阻挠这两个国家的和平统一。在日内瓦会议上达成的关于恢复印度支那和平的协议正处在威胁之下。台湾地区的紧张局势仍旧存在。
    为维护和巩固和平而建立的联合国，没有完成它的基本任务——使各国人民免于遭受新战争的威胁。联合国中美国侵略集团所操纵的多数，拒绝了苏联提出的关于缔结裁减军备和禁止原子武器和氢武器生产的国际协定的建议，拒绝承认中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。
    新世界大战的挑拨者继续执行在国际关系中使用实力的政策。这种政策只会导致新的毁灭战争。爱好和平的人民谴责这种政策。他们看到，现在有着解决国际争执问题的其他道路。苏奥谈判的结果、周恩来关于中国政府愿同美国谈判以缓和远东局势的声明和亚非会议的结果都证明了，只要有关国家的政府愿意通过谈判和缔结协定的方式解决国际问题，进一步缓和国际局势是有实际可能的。
    在这种局势下，各国人民保卫和平的积极斗争具有极其重大的意义。
    各国人民保卫和平事业的毫不动摇的意志表现为：和平运动不断发展，现在已经有许多亿的人参加了这个运动，各国人民普遍痛恨准备原子战争的政策。
    目前，世界各国都在为世界和平理事会反对准备原子战争的“告全世界人民书”广泛展开征集签名运动。这个“告全世界人民书”得到全体苏联人——忠诚的和始终不渝的和平战士的全力支持。
    苏联人民完全支持和拥护苏联政府的目的在于缓和国际紧张局势、保卫普遍安全，以及促进各国间的文化和经济合作的和平政策。
    第五届全苏保卫和平大会表示全体爱好和平的苏联人民的意志，委托被选为出席世界和平大会的代表：
    一、向世界和平大会的全体参加者保证，苏联人民将坚决地、始终不渝地为巩固国际和平，为缓和国际紧张局势，为在有关方面相互协商的基础上和平解决各种争端而奋斗。相信自己力量的苏联，依靠全国人民坚不可破的团结，充满决心来制止新的世界大战。和以往一样，各国人民认为苏联是争取和平和进步的斗争中的坚固的和牢不可破的堡垒。
    二、重申：苏联人民坚持不渝地要求各国立即停止原子武器的生产和销毁所有原子武器的储存，以及无条件地禁止原子武器和其他类型的大规模毁灭性武器，同时建立有效的国际监督来保障禁令的实施。
    苏联人认为，作为禁止原子武器的初步措施之一，必须首先禁止原子武器和氢武器的试验。苏联以国际合作的利益为出发点，准备把自己在和平利用原子能的研究方面的经验告诉其他国家。原子能应该只用于促进人类的进步和繁荣。苏联人民主张必须终止扩充军备和立即解决普遍裁减各种军备的问题。
    三、宣布：苏联人民支持中华人民共和国和印度共和国两国总理所宣布的、并为其他许多国家所赞同的关于国与国之间相处的五项原则，这五项原则是：互相尊重领土主权；互不侵犯；互不干涉内政；平等互利；和平共处。
    四、重申：苏联人民同欧洲各国人民一样，认为德国军国主义的复活是对和平的威胁。他们主张和平解决德国问题，支持建立一种能够保障和平和欧洲一切大小国家的主权的集体安全体系。
    五、对正在为自由和独立而斗争的亚洲和非洲各国人民表示深切的同情，亚非会议和缓和国际紧张局势的亚洲国家会议的决议体现了亚非两洲人民的意志。
    六、声明：苏联主张建立和尽量扩大各国之间的经济和文化联系，主张消除醉心于继续进行冷战的集团为阻碍这种联系而制造的现有的一切障碍和限制。
    七、代表大会责成苏联代表们同所有关心维护和巩固和平的大会参加者建立密切的联系和积极的合作，不问他们的民族、政治和宗教观点、社会地位和所属的党派如何，因为只有一切爱好和平的人都团结起来才能制止新的破坏性的战争。
    我们，第五届全苏保卫和平大会的代表们，表示深信：在赫尔辛基举行的世界和平大会将是各国人民对保障持久和平和各国和平合作事业的一个重大的贡献。
    各国人民能够而且应当粉碎侵略者的计划。各国人民有足够的力量，以争取和平事业的胜利。
