Exposing Liu Xuewei's Anti-Party Activities in Shanghai's Literary and Art Circles
　　Ke Lan
　　Liu Xuewei, a follower of Hu Feng, is one of the agents of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique within the Chinese Communist Party. During his leadership in literary and art work in East China and Shanghai, Liu Xuewei established and cultivated a sectarian organization of the Hu Feng clique, seized the New Literature and Art Publishing House, and weakened and resisted the leadership of the Party. At the same time, he used his authority to publish his own collection of essays, spreading erroneous literary and artistic ideas. His erroneous literary and artistic ideas have already been exposed and criticized by comrades such as Lin Mohan. Now I will expose some of Liu Xuewei's serious anti-Party activities in his leadership of literary and art work in East China and Shanghai over the past few years:
　　First, Liu Xuewei violated the Party's literary and artistic policies, adopting a double-dealing attitude of outwardly complying but inwardly opposing the basic principle that literary and artistic workers must go deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to experience life and undergo ideological remolding. Before the literary and artistic rectification campaign, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Shanghai's literary and art circles organized a relatively large-scale ideological remolding movement to participate in land reform, the harnessing of the Huai River, and the democratic reform of factories. At that time, many comrades in the literary and art circles enthusiastically responded to this call, forming three large teams to go to Anhui, the Huai River, and Shanghai factories to immerse themselves in life. Before they went, the leaders made ideological mobilizations and gave some special reports as ideological preparation for going deep into life. For example, the comrades participating in the Huai River harnessing team invited comrades from the relevant water conservancy departments in charge of the Huai River harnessing to give reports and introduce the situation; and after they went down, they regularly reported and corresponded, maintaining regular contact and receiving instructions from relevant institutions in Shanghai. After these comrades returned, not only did the vast majority feel that this immersion in life had been very rewarding and that their thinking had been improved to a certain extent, but they also achieved great results in their creative work. For example, the Shanghai Municipal People's Pingtan Troupe of quyi arts collectively created the medium-length pingtan "We Must Fix the Huai River" after participating in the Huai River harnessing, which was warmly welcomed by the masses and valued by all parties; many writers, musicians, and painters have also since created many works. Judging from just such an event, we should welcome the fact that for the first time, literary and artistic workers and intellectuals who had long been isolated from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers showed such high enthusiasm and demanded ideological remolding, and we should affirm their achievements in experiencing life, despite their shortcomings. In essence, it was successful and rewarding. Moreover, through this concrete example, it can be seen that implementing our Party's literary and artistic policy of going deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers is correct and supported by the masses. But how did Liu Xuewei, who was then the head of the Literary and Art Department of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, view this ideological remolding movement? He completely disregarded the facts and wrote a report to the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee (this report was printed in lead type), denying the significance of this organization of literary and artistic workers to immerse themselves in life. In the report, he believed that organizing literary and artistic workers to go to factories was "driving ducks." On the one hand, he exaggerated certain individual errors in the organization work (these errors were caused by the lack of experience in carrying out such ideological remolding work for the first time after liberation and were only related to working methods). On the other hand, he deliberately emphasized the fact that individual literary and artistic workers could not endure the hardship of life after going down, and ran back to Shanghai after a short period of time, and that some instances of despising the masses occurred in their contact with the masses, and he concluded that this ideological remolding was a complete failure. What was his intention? In particular, to slander such a conscious ideological remolding movement as "driving ducks," to describe the vast literary and artistic workers in Shanghai after liberation as "ducks," to describe the organizers of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles as "duck drivers" wielding long poles, and to regard the conscious and voluntary ideological remolding as "driving" with deep hatred—is this the kind of thing a party member would say? Isn't this filled with the smell of Hu Feng's anti-Party thought? Liu Xuewei exaggerated and used certain non-principle shortcomings in his work to carry out his sectarian activities, fundamentally denying and resisting the Party's literary and artistic policies, and carrying out the greatest slander. Was he standing on the Party's position? Obviously, he was deceiving the Party and opposing the Party's policy of ideological remolding of intellectuals under the guise of inspecting work and reporting to the Party.
　　Second, Liu Xuewei also used the same method as above to protect Hu Feng's core members, Geng Yong and Luo Luo, in order to hinder the development of the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." The fact is this: When the Central Committee proposed launching ideological criticism of the erroneous film "The Life of Wu Xun," the relevant responsible comrades in Shanghai all wrote articles in newspapers and magazines to make preliminary self-criticisms and ideological criticisms. However, in order to allow such an ideological movement to be universally launched in Shanghai's literary and art circles, not just stopping at the ideological self-criticisms of a few responsible comrades, but to allow every literary and artistic worker to receive education from this criticism of bourgeois literary and artistic thought, there was a call for every literary and artistic worker to participate in this ideological struggle and examine their own thoughts. At that time, Comrade Yu Sun of "Liberation Daily," in response to this situation, believed that more literary and artistic workers and educators should be mobilized to pay attention to this ideological struggle, so he wrote a short article entitled "Everyone Is Responsible." This short article had the shortcoming of not being comprehensive enough in certain wording, but its intention was correct, and its entire spirit was in line with the movement's policy at the time. However, Geng Yong, a core member of the Hu Feng clique, used this short article to make a big issue out of it: In order to obstruct the widespread development of the criticism movement against "The Life of Wu Xun," he forcibly argued that the problem of "The Life of Wu Xun" was only a problem for a few people, trivializing such a serious class struggle against bourgeois literary and artistic thought, deliberately reducing its political significance and ideological educational role; and using it to launch personal attacks on a few leading comrades in order to achieve the despicable goals of their sectarian activities. After Geng Yong's article with ulterior motives was published in the "Literary and Art Circles" supplement edited by the Hu Feng clique, it aroused opposition and dissatisfaction from many readers. At that time, the Art Department of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture, in response to public demand, prepared to convene a symposium to criticize Geng Yong's erroneous views, inviting editors of Shanghai newspapers and magazines and writers (including Geng Yong) to participate in the discussion, and stating in the notice that Geng Yong would be asked to talk about the writing motivation of his article. Convening such a meeting and launching criticism and discussion at the meeting to carry out an ideological struggle in order to clear away the obstacles hindering the development of the ideological criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" was completely necessary and timely. However, Liu Xuewei seized on the "inappropriate wording" of this notice and immediately ordered the meeting to be stopped. The meeting notice was also ordered to be withdrawn immediately. As a result, the notice was of course cancelled, the meeting was stopped, and it has not been convened since. Geng Yong's erroneous views and conspiracies were of course not criticized. As a result, not only could the ideological criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" not be deepened or developed in Shanghai, causing great losses to this study movement and causing a failure in the ideological struggle, but it also gave the Hu Feng anti-Party elements an opportunity to sow discord and spread rumors and attacks. Isn't this evidence of Liu Xuewei's protection of the Hu Feng reactionaries? Even an ordinary reader could detect Geng Yong's mistake. Could Liu Xuewei not see it? Even if the notice was wrong, didn't Liu Xuewei know that this practice of "avoiding eating for fear of choking," this practice of cancelling ideological struggle due to inappropriate methods, was wrong? No! He knew it; he did it on purpose. There is further evidence below: Afterwards, another core member of Hu Feng, Zhang Yu, wrote an article to "Literary Gazette" during the literary and art rectification campaign, attacking the leading comrades of Shanghai's literary and art circles, distorting this unrealized fact into using administrative orders to suppress criticism and self-criticism. The development of this conspiracy with ulterior motives to such a rampant degree is inseparable from Liu Xuewei's protection and support. Someone tipped them off. This is also the inevitable result of the Hu Feng clique finding their echoers within the Party.
　　From the materials we already know, it is fully proven that since 1951, under the leadership and protection of Liu Xuewei, the Hu Feng reactionary clique has been planning a series of heinous activities to oppose the Party's literary and artistic leadership. Their insidiousness and cunning are almost unbelievable.
　　Judging from these facts alone, the losses and harms that Liu Xuewei brought to the Party's literary and artistic cause during his time in East China and Shanghai were serious. He actually became Hu Feng's agent within the Party, using his authority to carry out sectarian activities and establish small organizations. I personally experienced all of the above facts and feel them even more deeply, so I must expose them.

　　揭露刘雪苇在上海文艺界中的反党活动
　　柯蓝
    胡风的追随者——刘雪苇是胡风反党集团在中国共产党内的代理人之一。刘雪苇在华东、上海的文艺领导工作中，树立、培养胡风集团的宗派组织，霸占新文艺出版社，削弱和抵制党的领导。同时利用职权出版自己的论文集，散布错误文艺思想。关于他的错误的文艺思想，已有林默涵等同志加以揭露和批判。现在我把刘雪苇在华东、上海这几年的文艺领导工作中一些严重反党活动揭露如下：
    其一，刘雪苇违反党的文艺政策，对于文艺工作者必须深入工农兵群众体验生活、进行思想改造的基本方针，采取了阳奉阴违的两面派态度。在文艺整风前，上海文艺界在市文化局和文联的领导下，曾经组织了一次较大规模的参加土地改革、参加治淮、参加工厂民主改革的思想改造运动。当时文艺界许多同志都热烈响应了这一个号召，编成了三个大队，分别到安徽、淮河、上海工厂去深入生活。下去之前领导方面都作了思想动员，还作了一些专门报告，作为深入生活时的思想准备。如参加治淮大队的同志就请有关治淮的水利部门的同志来作过报告和介绍情况；并且下去之后，还定期有汇报和通信，和上海有关机构取得经常的联系与指示。这些同志们回来之后，不仅绝大多数对这一次深入生活，都感到有很大收获，思想上有一定的提高，而且在创作上也有很大的成绩。如曲艺方面的上海市人民评弹工作团，参加治淮回来就集体创作了“一定要把淮河修好”中篇评弹，受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎和各方面的重视；许多作家、音乐家、画家们也从此而创作了许多作品。仅从这样一件事看，我们对于长期和工农兵群众隔绝的文艺工作者和知识分子第一次表示了这么高的热情，要求思想改造，是应该欢迎的，对于他们下去体验生活的成绩也是应该肯定的，尽管他们还有不少缺点，但在基本上是成功的、有收获的。而且通过这一具体事例，也可以看出贯彻我们党的文艺政策——深入工农兵群众的方针是正确的、受到群众拥护的。但是当时身居中共中央华东局宣传部文艺处处长之职的刘雪苇，他是怎样来看这一次思想改造运动的呢？他完全不顾事实地给中共中央华东局写了一个报告（这个报告是用铅印印出来的），否认了这一次组织文艺工作者深入生活的意义，在报告中认为这样组织文艺工作者下了下工厂是“赶鸭子”。他一方面夸大了组织工作中的某些个别错误，（这种错误是由于解放初期，第一次进行这样的思想改造工作，没有经验造成的，也只是属于工作方法上的。）另一方面故意强调了个别文艺工作者下去之后，生活上不能吃苦，很短时期又跑回上海，和在与群众接近中，发生某些轻视群众的事实，就得出结论说：这次思想改造完全失败了。这是什么居心呢？特别把这样一个自觉的思想改造运动污蔑为
  “赶鸭子”，把解放后的上海广大的文艺工作者形容为“鸭子”，把当时上海文化局和文联的组织工作者形容为手执长竿的“赶鸭者”，把自觉自愿的思想改造深痛恶绝地看成为“赶”，这种说法，像是一个党员说的吗？这不正是充满了胡风反党思想的气味吗？刘雪苇夸大和利用工作中某些非原则性的缺点，来进行其宗派活动，从基本上来否认和对抗党的文艺政策，并且进行了最大的污蔑。他是站在党的立场上吗？很明显，他是打着检查工作的招牌，打着向党做报告的招牌，来欺骗党，来反对党的知识分子思想改造政策的。
    其二、刘雪苇也用上述同一手法，对胡风小集团骨干分子耿庸、罗洛等进行包庇，来阻碍对电影
  “武训传”批判的开展。事实是这样：当中央提出对错误电影“武训传”展开思想批判的时候，上海方面有关的负责同志都写了文章在报刊做了初步检讨和思想批判。但为了让这样一个思想运动能够在上海文艺界普遍展开，不只是停留在少数负责同志的思想检查上，而让每一个文艺工作者，都能够从这次对资产阶级文艺思想进行批判中获得教育，曾经号召每一个文艺工作者都参加到这一思想斗争中来检查自己的思想。当时“解放日报”虞荪同志针对这一情况，认为应该动员更多的文艺工作者、教育工作者来关心这一思想斗争，便写了一篇“人人有责”的短文。这篇短文在某些措词上有不够全面的缺点，但其用意是对的，其整个精神也是符合当时的运动方针的。而胡风集团骨干分子耿庸就利用这篇短文，大做其反面文章：为了阻挠对“武训传”批判运动的普遍展开，他便强词夺理地把“武训传”的问题，硬说成只是少数人的问题，把这样一场严肃反对资产阶级文艺思想的阶级斗争庸俗化，故意降低它的政治意义和思想教育作用；并从中利用它来作为对少数领导同志的人身攻击，以达到他们宗派活动的卑鄙目的。耿庸这种别有居心的文章在胡风小集团编辑的副刊“文学界”发表后，引起了许多读者的反对和不满。当时上海文化局艺术处根据群众要求，准备召集一个座谈会，来对耿庸的错误观点进行一次批判，邀请上海各报刊编辑和作家（包括耿庸）来参加讨论，并且在通知上写明要请耿庸谈谈他这篇文章的写作动机。要召集这样一个会，在会上来展开批判讨论，来进行一番思想斗争，以便扫清妨碍“武训传”思想批判展开的障碍，这一做法是完全必要和适时的。而刘雪苇却抓住了这一通知的“措辞不当”，马上命令停止召集这个会议。会议通知也命令马上收回。结果，通知当然取消了，会议也停止召开了，而且也一直不召开了。耿庸的错误观点和阴谋活动当然就受不到批判。其结果，不仅“武训传”思想批判在上海无法深入、无法展开，使这一次的学习运动受到很大的损失，造成在思想斗争中的失败，而且给了胡风反党分子以一个挑拨离间、造谣攻击的机会。这不是刘雪苇包庇胡风反动集团的证据吗？耿庸的错误连一个普通读者都可以发觉出来，难道刘雪苇看不到吗？退一万步说，即令这一通知错了，那这种“因噎废食”的做法，这种因方式不当而取消思想斗争的做法，刘雪苇难道不知道不对吗？不！他是知道的，他是故意这样做的。下面还有事实为证：事后另一胡风骨干分子张禹在文艺整风中给“文艺报”写文章，对上海文艺界领导同志进行攻击的时候，就把这么一件没有实现的事实，歪曲成为用行政命令压制批评和自我批评。这种别有居心的阴谋活动，发展到如此猖狂的程度，是和刘雪苇的包庇和支持分不开的。这是有人通风报信的。这也是胡风小集团在党内找到了他们的应声虫的必然结果。
    从现在我们已经知道的材料，完全证明从一九五一年开始，胡风反动集团就在刘雪苇的主持和包庇之下，有计划地进行了一连串的反对党的文艺领导的罪恶活动。他们的阴险狡诈，几乎是难以令人相信的。
    单从上述这些事实看来，刘雪苇在华东和上海期间，给党的文艺事业带来的损失和危害是严重的。他实际上成为胡风在党内的代理人，利用职权进行宗派活动、树立小组织。上述这些事实我都是亲历的，感受更深，所以不能不予以揭发。
