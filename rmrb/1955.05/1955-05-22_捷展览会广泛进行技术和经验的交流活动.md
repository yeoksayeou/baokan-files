　　The Czechoslovak Ten Years of Socialist Construction Achievements Exhibition has been widely conducting technical and experience exchange activities since April 18th. The general public viewing of the exhibition concluded on May 20th. A five-day professional viewing will begin on May 21st.

　　The exhibition has handled questions raised by more than 400 units through methods such as symposiums, on-site Q&A, on-site guidance, and written replies. Many factories and enterprises in our country have received a lot of help from Czechoslovak experts in terms of technology and further understanding the performance of Czechoslovak equipment. In the 56 held report meetings, workers and technicians from many units were very satisfied with the topics presented by Czechoslovak experts, such as "Development and New Operating Methods of Czech Machine Tools," "Equipment for the Shoemaking Industry," "Construction of Chemical Factories," "Structure and Methods of Automatic Telephone Exchanges," "Glass Fiber," "Czech Water and Oil Pipeline Valves and Industrial Uses," and "Construction of Mineral Oil Factories." After the Bureau of Building Materials Industry of the Ministry of Heavy Industry invited Czechoslovak glass experts to give two reports on glass fiber, it has prepared to organize staff for more systematic study. Technicians and workers from various units expressed sincere gratitude for the enthusiastic help and guidance of the Czechoslovak experts.

　　May 21st was the first day of the professional viewing. The exhibition received 2,889 visitors from factories, enterprises, schools, and hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Taiyuan, Anshan, DahuoFang Reservoir, and other places. Czechoslovak experts and technicians performed on-site demonstrations and answered questions raised by visitors regarding design, installation, maintenance, operation, and other aspects. They repeatedly told Chinese workers how to use machines most economically and how to improve labor productivity. Czechoslovak machine tool expert Majkus was extremely concerned about the use of Czechoslovak machine tools in China. Shortly after arriving in Beijing, he visited the China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation. On the 21st, he warmly received the commodity staff of the China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation, led them to visit gear milling machines, universal lathes, and gear hobbing machines, explaining in detail the models, performance, characteristics, precision, general operating methods, output, prices, and so on, and answered various questions. Eighty-five employees of the Bureau of Building Materials Industry of the Ministry of Heavy Industry rushed to visit early in the morning of the 21st. Factory directors and chief engineers from some glass factories, ceramic factories, and asbestos tile factories from various places raised many questions, hoping to absorb the advanced technology and experience of Czechoslovakia to solve the current problems existing in their factories. Employees of the Printing Factory of the People's Bank of China showed great interest in Czechoslovak automatic cutting machines. One hundred doctors and nurses from the Beijing No. 7 Hospital particularly liked the X-ray machines, infant incubators, hydrotherapy machines, and sun lamps displayed in the pavilion. They asked experts to perform demonstrations. Many employees also watched Czechoslovak technical films shown in the exhibition's cinema.
