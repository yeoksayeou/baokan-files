　　Today's Bailingmiao
　　Zongheng
    Traveling north from Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and traversing the steep and perilous Daqing Mountains, one enters the vast and beautiful Darhan Muminggan Joint Banner grassland. Further ahead, nestled among the mountains, is a magnificent array of red buildings – the well-known Bailingmiao.
    Due to its strategic location at the intersection of roads and its commanding terrain, Bailingmiao was once used by Japanese imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries as a military base to control the people of the grasslands. During the period of reactionary rule, countless hardworking Mongolian herdsmen were forced to flee to distant lands. The lush pastures around Bailingmiao were deserted, and death and terror shrouded the entire Darhan Muminggan Joint Banner grassland.
    After liberation, the Banner People's Government was established in Bailingmiao. Many herdsmen who had fled to other places returned to their homes one after another, and herds of cattle and sheep reappeared on the pastures around Bailingmiao. Over the past few years, the Communist Party of China Darhan Muminggan Joint Banner Committee and the Banner People's Government have conscientiously implemented the Party's ethnic policies, vigorously supporting the development of animal husbandry production and carrying out various construction projects, transforming Bailingmiao from a desolate and dilapidated place into a rising market town on the grassland.
    Now, Bailingmiao has a newly built, wide, and straight east-west street. On this street, there are state-owned trading companies, supply and marketing cooperative department stores, food stores, Xinhua Bookstore, post and telecommunications bureau, People's Bank, transportation station, and other facilities. In the open and flat space at the western end of the street stands a row of wide and bright brick houses, which is the Banner-level Health Center. Herdsmen who come from more than a hundred miles away to see a doctor and women who are hospitalized for childbirth often stay here. Many herdsmen patients come to the hospital in carts, and when they recover and leave the hospital, they ride away on horseback in high spirits. Located at the foot of the northeastern slope of the temple is the Banner-level complete primary school. The school has more than 120 Mongolian children, 80 percent of whom receive student grants. A sheep breeding station is established on the east bank of the Aibuge River. Since 1953, they have been using Soviet Tsigai sheep to breed with the herdsmen's sheep. Now, many herdsmen's flocks have the delightful Tsigai breed of sheep running among them. Not far from the Banner-level primary school, there is also a weather station serving animal husbandry production. In addition, the Ulanqab League Grassland Workstation and the locally state-owned Ulanqab League Bailingmiao Ranch are also located on the grassland near Bailingmiao.
    Today, the desolate and impoverished scenes are no longer seen on the grassland. As time progresses, the face of the grassland is becoming more and more prosperous. On this grassland, if you casually strike up a conversation with any herdsman, they will tell you from their own experience that Bailingmiao has changed. In the past, it was the source of our disasters and sufferings, but now it is the source of our prosperity and happiness.

　　今日的百灵庙
　　纵横
    由内蒙古自治区首府呼和浩特市北行，翻过险峻陡峭的大青山，就进入了辽阔美丽的达尔罕茂明安联合旗草原。再前行，在群山环抱中，有一片壮丽的红色楼房，这便是远近知名的百灵庙。
    百灵庙由于四通八达，形势险要，日本帝国主义和国民党反动派都曾以此作为统治草原人民的军事基地。在反动统治时期，无数勤劳的蒙族牧民，被迫逃往远方，百灵庙周围人畜绝迹，水草丰美的牧场荒废了，死亡与恐怖笼罩着整个达茂联合旗草原。
    解放后，旗人民政府在百灵庙成立了。许多逃往他乡的牧民，陆续返回家园，成群的牛羊，又出现在百灵庙周围的牧场上。几年来，中共达尔罕茂明安联合旗委员会和旗人民政府认真地执行着党的民族政策，大力扶助发展牧业生产和进行各项建设，使百灵庙改变了荒凉残破的面貌，成为草原上新兴的集镇。
    现在，百灵庙新建了一条宽阔笔直的东西街道，在这条街道上，有国营贸易公司、供销合作社百货、食品门市部、新华书店、邮电局、人民银行、运输站等。在街道西端的空旷平坦的场地上，矗立着一列宽阔明亮的砖瓦房屋，便是旗立卫生院。这里经常住着远从百余里外前来看病的牧民和住院生产的妇女。很多牧民患者来院时，坐着大车，等病愈离院时，便精神愉快地骑上马走了。座落在庙东北山坡下的是旗立完全小学。全校有一百二十多个蒙族儿童，其中有百分之八十享受着助学金待遇。一所绵羊配种站设立在爱布格河东岸。他们从一九五三年起，就开始用苏联茨盖羊给牧民的羊群配种，现在有不少牧民的羊群里，奔跑着令人喜爱的茨盖种绵羊。和旗立小学相距不远，还有一座为牧业生产服务的气象站。此外，乌兰察布盟草原工作站及地方国营乌兰察布盟百灵庙牧场，也都设立在百灵庙附近的草原上。
    今天，在草原上再也看不到荒凉、贫困的景象，随着时间的前进，草原的面貌，愈来愈繁荣了。在这片草原上，你随便和那一位牧民攀谈起来，他都会用自己亲身的经历告诉你，百灵庙变了，过去它是我们灾难和痛苦的渊薮，现在是我们繁荣幸福的源泉了。
