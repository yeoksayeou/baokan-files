    Improving Leadership of Key Townships
  　Tian Liu
    In recent years, most counties across the country have established key townships. Local Party committees have created experiences, cultivated typical examples, and improved leadership methods through these key townships, thereby achieving great successes in the socialist transformation of agriculture in their respective regions. However, it is undeniable that in many areas, there are still shortcomings in the leadership work of key townships, which has prevented them from playing their due role. Improving the leadership of key townships and overcoming the shortcomings in this work is undoubtedly a problem worthy of attention in current rural work.
    One of the shortcomings in the leadership of key townships is the indiscriminate use of these townships. Various departments take all kinds of work to key townships for "pilot projects" and demand that the Party branches of key townships "vigorously assist" or "guarantee completion," causing cadres in key townships to be busy coping every day, without the time or possibility to devote their main energy to their main task—the socialist transformation of agriculture. Here is some information about Xizhanggeng key township. Xizhanggeng township is a key township of the Jieyu County Party Committee in Shanxi Province, and also a key township of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee. In December of last year, units such as the Electrical Appliance Company, Xinhua Bookstore, County Bureau of Culture and Education, and Cultural Center simultaneously went to this township to "break through a point and absorb experience." The Electrical Appliance Company was there to pilot the sale of rubber-wheeled carts; the Xinhua Bookstore was there to pilot the sale of New Year's pictures; the Bureau of Culture and Education was there to create experience in running winter schools; and the Cultural Center was there to create experience in carrying out cultural and recreational activities. In order to complete these tasks, the township cadres held one meeting after another and were busy all day long. At that time, the agricultural producers' cooperative in the township was eager to carry out annual distribution, revise the cooperative's charter, and plan production, but these tasks could not be carried out. In order to complete these tasks, the township's winter school became a mass meeting, mobilizing people to buy rubber-wheeled carts one day, publicizing the significance of buying New Year's pictures the next day, and teaching songs and dances the day after that. Comrade Li, who was dispatched by the County Party Committee to assist in the work of the village, said helplessly: "Is it necessary for all work to be piloted in key townships?" Raising this question is completely appropriate. The establishment of key townships is to enable cadres to gain experience in leading the socialist transformation of agriculture, thereby promoting the agricultural cooperativization cause of the entire region and county. Creating experience in selling rubber-wheeled carts, promoting New Year's pictures, and carrying out rural cultural and recreational activities is, of course, also necessary. However, to create these work experiences, it is not necessary to take them to key townships. Why do some departmental cadres like to go to key townships to create experience? This is because they are lazy. They are unwilling to truly delve into the masses and carry out arduous work, but see the favorable conditions of key townships, such as a good work foundation, high mass awareness, and active cadres, and go there for convenience. They do not understand that experience created without arduous work will certainly not be good experience, and work will certainly not be done well when using this kind of experience to guide work. This lazy phenomenon cannot continue, because this will not create any good experience, but will make the burden of key townships too heavy, and may even ruin key townships.
    Another shortcoming in leading key townships is forcing growth and taking over everything. Here is the situation of Yaoshanggou township, a key township in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province: In order to cultivate this key township well, the County Party Committee not only sent the main cadres at the district level to serve as township head and branch secretary, but also sent a large number of cadres to reside in this township to help with the work. Last year, there were more than 20 cadres stationed in this township, with an average of one cadre for each cultivation group in the agricultural cooperative (about ten households per group). This year, more than ten cadres, headed by the County Party Committee member, Deputy County Head, and Deputy Director of the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, were dispatched to reside in this township to help with the work. Because of the large number and strong abilities of the cadres stationed in this township, some good work experiences were indeed created last year. But at the same time, another result was produced: taking over everything. All the work of the township was discussed, studied, decided, and implemented by the resident cadres, and rarely was it to enlighten and help the township cadres to discuss, study, decide, and implement. The county work team had already considered many problems for the township cadres, and had also come up with ways to overcome many difficulties for the township cadres. As a result, the work enthusiasm of the township cadres was damaged, and the township cadres developed a sense of dependence, which affected and hindered the improvement and growth of the township cadres. Of course, strengthening leadership over key townships is necessary, but strengthening leadership is by no means taking over everything and forcing growth. The typical examples cultivated by this method are not firmly rooted; the experiences created by this method are not easily accepted or promoted by general township cadres because they do not have the same level of expertise as the county cadres. What should be particularly vigilant is that using this method to cultivate typical examples can easily lead to their detachment from the masses. In mid-March of this year, after the Wuxiang County Party Committee announced the list of cadres stationed in this township at the enlarged three-level cadre meeting, many township cadres had opinions. They said: "If we were also assigned so many and such strong cadres, our township would also become a model township." Precisely because of this, their enthusiasm for accepting the experiences of key townships to improve their own work was affected, thereby weakening the significance and role of establishing key townships.
    The working methods of arbitrarily using key townships and "cultivating typical examples" by forcing growth are the two main shortcomings in the current work of leading key townships, and are two important issues that must be addressed to improve the leadership of key townships.

### 改善对重点乡的领导

    改善对重点乡的领导
  　田流
    近几年来，全国大多数的县份，都建立了重点乡。各地党委通过这些重点乡创造了经验，培养了典型，改进了领导方法，从而使本地区的农业社会主义改造事业获得了很大成就。但是，不容否认，不少地区在对重点乡的领导工作中，还存在着一些缺点，致使重点乡没有起到它应有的作用。改善对重点乡的领导工作，克服这个工作中的缺点，无疑是当前农村工作中一个很值得注意的问题。
    在对重点乡的领导工作中，存在着的缺点之一，就是随便使用重点乡。各个部门把各项工作都拿到重点乡里去“试点”，而且都要求重点乡的党的支部“大力帮助”或“保证完成”，致使重点乡的干部每日忙于应付，没有时间和可能把主要的精力用于主要的工作——农业社会主义改造工作上面。这里是西张耿重点乡的一些情况。西张耿乡是山西省解虞县委的重点乡，同时又是山西省委的重点乡。去年十二月份同时到这个乡“突破一点，吸取经验”的就有交电公司、新华书店、县文教局、文化馆等单位。交电公司是为了推销胶皮轮大车去试点的；新华书店是为了推销新年画去试点的；文教局是去创造办冬学经验的；文化馆则是去创造开展文化娱乐工作经验的。乡里的干部们为着完成这些工作，举行一个又一个的会议，整天忙得不可开交。当时这个乡的农业生产合作社急于进行的年度分配、修订社章、计划生产等工作，却无法进行。为了完成这些工作，这个乡的冬学变成了群众会，今天动员买胶轮大车，明天宣传买新年画的意义，后天又教歌子和舞蹈。县委派驻该村帮助工作的李同志无可奈何地说：“是不是一切工作都要到重点乡里来试点呢？”提出这个问题完全是应当的。建立重点乡是为了使干部获得领导农业社会主义改造事业的经验，从而推进全区、全县的农业合作化事业。创造推销胶皮轮大车、推广新年画、开展农村文化娱乐等工作的经验，当然也是必要的。但是，要创造这些工作经验，却不一定都要拿到重点乡去创造。为什么有些部门的干部都喜欢到重点乡去创造经验呢？这是因为他们懒惰。他们不愿意真正深入群众进行艰苦工作，而是看到重点乡的工作基础好，群众觉悟高、干部工作积极等有利条件，到那里去图方便。他们不了解不经过艰苦工作创造出来的经验，就一定不是好的经验，拿这种经验去指导工作，工作就一定会做不好。这种懒惰现象不能再继续下去了，因为这创造不出什么好经验，却会使重点乡的负荷太重，甚至会把重点乡搞垮。
    领导重点乡的另一个缺点，是拔苗助长和包办代替。这里是山西省武乡县重点乡窑上沟乡的情形：县委为了把这个重点乡培养好，不仅派了区级主要干部到这个乡担任乡长和支部书记，而且还派了大批干部长驻这个乡帮助工作。去年长驻这个乡的干部达二十多个，农业社的每一个耕作小组（每组十户左右）平均有一个干部。今年又派了以县委委员、副县长、农林局副局长等主要干部为首的十多个干部长驻这个乡帮助工作。因为派驻这个乡的干部数量多，能力强，去年的确创造出了一些较好的工作经验。但同时也产生了另一方面的结果：包办代替。乡的一切工作都是驻乡干部们讨论、研究、决定和贯彻执行，很少是启发、帮助这个乡的干部们讨论、研究、决定和贯彻执行。许多问题县的工作队已经替乡干部考虑好，许多困难也已经替乡干部想出克服的办法。这样作的结果，就损害了乡干部的工作积极性，使乡干部产生了依赖思想，从而影响和阻碍了乡干部的提高和成长。当然，加强对重点乡的领导是必需的，但加强领导，绝不是包办代替和拔苗助长。用这种方法培养起来的典型，根基是不稳固的；用这种方法创造出来的经验，一般的乡干部因为没有县干部那样高的水平，是接受不了的，是不容易推广的。特别应该引起警惕的，是用这种方法来培养典型，很容易使它脱离群众。今年三月中旬，武乡县委在扩大三级干部会议上宣布了派驻这个乡的干部名单后，不少乡干部有意见，他们说：“要是给我们也派这么多、这么强的干部去，俺乡也会成为模范乡。”正因为如此，就影响了他们接受重点乡经验来改进自己工作的积极性和热情，从而削弱了建立重点乡的意义和作用。
    随便使用重点乡和拔苗助长的“培养典型”的工作方法，是目前领导重点乡工作中的两个主要缺点，是改善对重点乡领导的两个必须注意解决的重要问题。
