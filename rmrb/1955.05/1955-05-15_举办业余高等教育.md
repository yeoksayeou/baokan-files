　　Running Amateur Higher Education
　　One of the difficulties in the current national construction undertaking is the lack of sufficient scientific and technical personnel and management cadres. In order to solve this problem, in addition to striving to train new scientific and technical personnel, we must also strive to improve the political and theoretical level and scientific knowledge level of the vast number of working cadres.
　　In order to improve the level of working cadres, we should learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and actively establish and develop correspondence departments, night universities affiliated to universities and colleges, and night universities affiliated to large factories and mines. The advantages of this kind of amateur higher education are: First, the people who enroll study in their spare time, which does not hinder their work and production, and as the students’ scientific and technical knowledge increases, they can also improve work efficiency and promote production development. Second, the students are all people with production experience or other work experience, who can summarize their own experience in the learning process and raise their daily accumulated perceptual knowledge to rational understanding; at the same time, they can apply the learned book knowledge to their work, so that they can achieve consistency between theory and practice and achieve better results. Third, the correspondence departments and night universities affiliated to universities and colleges, and the night universities run by large factories and mining enterprises generally use the original teachers and engineering technicians to teach part-time, and use the original school buildings and teaching equipment for teaching activities, so it is also very economical in the use of human, material and financial resources. Fourth, precisely because running correspondence departments and night universities costs less and yields more, it makes it possible for more people to receive higher education.
　　At present, in the country's factories and mining enterprises, party and government organs, mass organizations, secondary schools, and a small number of state-owned farms, there are about 400,000 working cadres, middle school teachers, and industrial workers with high school graduation or equivalent academic qualifications who urgently need to receive amateur correspondence education or enter night universities for further study. In the future, with the increase in the number of graduates from spare-time secondary education in industry and agriculture and from high schools and secondary vocational schools, the number of people requiring amateur higher education will be even greater. It is particularly worth noting that cadres transferred from local areas and the military to factories and mining enterprises in recent years, and cadres promoted from industrial workers, have combat experience and production experience, but their professional knowledge or theoretical level is not high, and they urgently need to study. In order to meet their needs, a number of universities and colleges and large factories and mines have established correspondence departments and night universities. The correspondence training course of the Renmin University of China has already taken shape, and now has nine majors in economics, such as industrial economics and industrial accounting, enrolling a total of 2,547 correspondence students, with a study period of two years, and correspondence teaching and counseling stations have been set up in Beijing, Tianjin, and Taiyuan, and the third phase of correspondence students has been enrolled in Tianjin and Taiyuan. The correspondence training class affiliated to Northeast Normal University currently has two majors, Chinese Language and Mathematics, enrolling a total of 1,000 correspondence students (mainly middle school teachers with the equivalent of high school graduation), with a study period of three years, and nineteen correspondence stations have been established in towns along the railway line in Northeast China. At present, there are 29 night universities in the country, with a total of 10,163 students. Among the above-mentioned two correspondence departments and twenty-nine night universities, only the night school department of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics has a history of five years and has been included in the state cadre training plan, while the others are self-established. Their basic situation is poor leadership, chaotic systems, small scale, small number of people, and low quality. All schools lack teachers, textbooks, and funding, and the students' study time has not been guaranteed.
　　The existence of these problems is primarily due to the insufficient attention paid by the higher education administrative department to running amateur higher education, and the failure to provide due support to the correspondence departments and night universities established by individual schools and factories and mining enterprises, and the failure to summarize and promote the experience in this area in a timely manner. At the same time, many universities and colleges are unwilling to run correspondence departments and night universities because they have heavy regular teaching tasks and are in a tense stage of teaching reform, and lack fixed correspondence textbooks and teaching method guides. This situation must be improved. Otherwise, it will be difficult to improve the level of the vast number of working cadres, and higher correspondence education and night universities will not be able to undertake certain tasks of training cadres for the country. In the future, universities and colleges should, as far as possible, establish and develop more correspondence departments and night universities with emphasis.
　　At present, the Ministry of Higher Education is preparing a plan for running correspondence departments and night universities during the last three years of the first five-year plan construction period. Since our country's universities and colleges still lack a large amount of complete experience in running correspondence departments and night universities, the working policy in the next three years should be to consolidate the existing correspondence departments and night universities, appropriately develop higher engineering, normal, and finance and economics subjects, and focus on the trial of higher agricultural correspondence education and night universities, and pay attention to accumulating experience to create conditions for large-scale development of amateur higher education in the future. In order to achieve this policy and complete the tasks for the next three years, the relevant departments should pay attention to solving the following problems.
　　First, teachers in universities and colleges and leading staff in factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, organizations, and secondary schools must first fully value higher correspondence education and night universities, and regard them as an effective way to improve the quality of working cadres, industrial workers, and secondary school teachers, and it is one of the important methods for training scientific and technical personnel. We must not regard correspondence departments and night universities as dispensable, and we must not think that we cannot run them without experience.
　　Second, the Ministry of Higher Education should, in conjunction with relevant parties, formulate regulations and rules on higher correspondence schools (or correspondence departments) and night universities, and make clear provisions on the length of schooling, teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, textbooks, student admission conditions and treatment, administrative leadership, and sources of funding, so that each school has something to follow.
　　Third, it is necessary to solve the problem of teachers for correspondence departments and night universities in universities and colleges in a planned way. In order to ensure a certain teaching quality, in the future, in addition to continuing to rely on relevant universities and colleges and large factories and mining enterprises to solve part of the teachers themselves, when the state uniformly allocates university and college graduates, it should appropriately supplement the teachers needed by correspondence departments and night universities in universities and colleges; at the same time, it is also necessary to gradually improve the scientific and technical level and business ability of the existing teachers in correspondence departments and night universities.
　　Fourth, provisions should be made on the study time for students who enter the correspondence departments and night universities of universities and colleges to ensure their studies.
　　Finally, we should pay attention to summarizing the experience of existing correspondence departments and night universities and introduce them in a timely manner to help schools that are newly running correspondence departments and night universities avoid detours.

　　举办业余高等教育
    当前国家建设事业中的困难之一，是缺乏足够的科学技术人材和管理干部。为了解决这一问题，除努力培养新的科学技术人材以外，还必须努力提高广大在职干部的政治理论水平和科学知识水平。
    为了提高在职干部的水平，应当学习苏联的先进经验，积极创办和发展高等学校附设的函授部、夜大学和大型厂矿附设的夜大学。这种业余的高等教育的优点是：一、入学的人利用业余时间进行学习，对工作和生产没有妨碍，而且随着学员的科学技术知识的增进，还能够提高工作效率，促进生产发展。二、学员都是有生产经验或其他工作经验的人，可以在学习过程中总结自己的经验，把平日所积累的感性知识上升到理性认识；同时又能将学习到的书本知识运用到工作中去，因而能够做到理论和实际一致，收到比较好的效果。三、高等学校附设的函授部、夜大学和大型厂矿企业办理的夜大学，一般地都是利用原有的教师和工程技术人员来兼课，并利用原有的校舍、教学设备进行教学活动，因此在人力、物力、财力的使用上也很经济。四、正因为举办函授部和夜大学花费少而收效大，它就有可能使更多的人接受高等教育。
    目前全国各厂矿企业部门、党政机关、群众团体、中等学校和少数的国营农场，约有四十万左右具有高中毕业或同等学力的在职干部、中学教师、产业工人，他们迫切需要进行业余的函授教育或是进入夜大学继续深造。今后随着工农业余中等教育和高中、中等专业学校毕业生的增加，要求受业余高等教育的人数将更要多些。特别值得注意的，就是几年来从地方上、部队上调到厂矿企业部门的干部，和从产业工人中提拔的干部，他们有斗争经验和生产经验，但专业知识或理论水平不高，迫切需要学习。为了满足他们的需要，已经有若干高等学校和大型厂矿举办了函授部和夜大学。中国人民大学的函授专修科已经粗具规模，现设有经济类的工业经济、工业会计等九个专业，共招收函授生二千五百四十七人，学习期限两年，并在北京、天津、太原三地设有函授教学辅导站，在天津和太原两地招收了第三期函授生。东北师范大学附设的函授专修班，现有中国语文和数学两个专业，共招收函授生（主要是相当于高中毕业程度的中等学校教员）一千人，学习期限是三年，已在东北沿铁路线的城镇设立十九个函授站。目前全国已有二十九所夜大学，共有学生一万○一百六十三人。上述两个函授部和二十九个夜大学中，只有上海财经学院夜校部已有五年的历史并已列入国家培养干部计划以内，其他都是自行创办的。它们的基本情况是领导差、制度乱、规模小、人数少、质量低，各校都缺乏师资、教材、经费，学员的学习时间也还没有得到保证。
    这些问题的存在，首先是由于高等教育行政部门对办理业余的高等教育重视不够，对个别学校和厂矿企业创办的函授部和夜大学没有给以应有的支持，没有及时总结这方面的经验并加以推广。同时，许多高等学校因为正规教学的任务很重，又处在教学改革的紧张阶段，缺乏固定的函授教材和教学法指导书，因此，它们也不愿意办理函授部和夜大学。这种状况必须加以改进。否则广大在职干部的水平是很难提高的，而高等函授教育和夜大学也无法担负起为国家培养干部的一定的任务。今后，高等学校应尽可能地、有重点地创办和发展更多的函授部和夜大学。
    目前，高等教育部已在编制第一个五年计划建设时期后三年办理函授部和夜大学的计划。由于我国各个高等学校至今还缺乏大量办理函授部和夜大学的成套经验，在今后三年内的工作方针，应是整顿巩固现有的函授部和夜大学，适当地发展高等工科、师范、财经等科和重点试办高等农科函授教育及夜大学，注意积累经验，为今后大量发展业余高等教育创造条件。为了实现这个方针和完成今后三年的任务，有关部门应该注意解决下列问题。
    第一，高等学校教师和各厂矿、企业、机关、团体、中等学校的领导工作人员，首先要充分重视高等函授教育和夜大学，把它看成是提高在职干部、产业工人和中等学校师资的质量的有效办法，它是培养科学技术人材的重要方法之一。不能把函授部和夜大学看得可有可无，也不要以为没有经验就无法举办。
    第二，高等教育部要会同有关方面拟定关于高等函授学校（或函授部）和夜大学的规章制度，对于学制、教学计划、教学大纲、教材、学员入学条件和待遇、行政领导、经费来源等都要作出明确规定，以便各校有所遵循。　　第三，要有计划地解决高等学校函授部和夜大学的师资问题。为了保证一定的教学质量，今后除了继续依靠有关高等学校、大型厂矿企业自行解决部分的师资以外，在国家统一分配高等学校毕业生的时候，应该适当地补充高等学校函授部和夜大学所需要的师资；同时也要逐步地提高函授部和夜大学现有师资的科学技术水平和业务能力。
    第四，对于升入高等学校函授部和夜大学的学员，在学习时间上应当作出规定，以保证他们的学习。
    最后，要注意总结现有函授部和夜大学的经验，及时加以介绍，以便帮助新办函授部和夜大学的学校少走弯路。
