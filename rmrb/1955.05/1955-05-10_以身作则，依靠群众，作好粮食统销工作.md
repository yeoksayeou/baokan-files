　　Set an Example, Rely on the Masses, and Do a Good Job in Grain Unified Purchase and Sales

    In rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work, the responsibility of rural grassroots cadres is significant. Rural grassroots cadres are the personnel who directly lead the masses in implementing the state's grain policy. Whether the state's unified purchase and sales policy can be implemented among the masses mainly depends on whether these grassroots cadres correctly implement this policy. The basic principle of rural grain unified purchase and sales is: supply what should be supplied, supply less to those who should receive less, and do not supply what should not be supplied. If grain is supplied to those who do not lack grain, or if more is supplied to those who lack little grain, it will inevitably affect the rational supply to those who truly lack grain. Grassroots cadres should, with a spirit of high responsibility to the state and the masses, earnestly improve grain unified purchase and sales work according to this principle. Any laissez-faire or perfunctory approach will harm the state and the masses.
    At present, some people in rural areas who do not lack grain also demand supply, or those who lack little grain demand more supply. This is certainly because these people do not understand the state's policy, have ideological concerns, and want to grab more grain. However, it is also greatly related to the fact that some grassroots cadres cannot correctly implement the unified purchase and sales policy and engage in corruption. Because, if a cadre buys more grain for himself, or shelters his relatives and friends when issuing supply certificates, then he will be on weak ground and will not dare to "offend people," and it will be impossible for him to righteously educate others to abide by the grain unified purchase and sales policy. Only when cadres set an example and implement the grain unified purchase and sales policy justly and selflessly, can they have the capital to persuade and educate the masses, and can they raise the weapon to fight against all kinds of corruption and violations of grain laws. Countless facts prove that if cadres set an example and firmly grasp the principle of grain supply, supplying what should be supplied, supplying less to those who should receive less, and not supplying what should not be supplied, then the masses will not only not complain about him, but will also support him; even if individual people insist on their wrong demands, they will be criticized and educated by the broad masses. In this way, he does not have to worry about "offending people" in rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work. Before the rectification of grain unified purchase and sales work in Qingfu Township, Sihui County, Guangdong Province, a few cadres engaged in corruption and bought more grain, and some masses also falsely reported the amount of grain shortage, demanding more supply. After the rectification of unified purchase and sales work began, the township branch first educated party members and cadres at party member meetings and cadre meetings, and criticized the corrupt behavior of township cadres Mo Linzu, Wu Tianlin, etc., thus improving the understanding of party members and cadres. Many party members and cadres led the masses to voluntarily give up their unreasonable demands. As a result, the township's grain unified purchase and sales plan was reduced from the original 24,500 jin reported by the masses to 15,000 jin. The masses were very satisfied with the adjusted grain supply plan, and their enthusiasm for production was high, actively digging wells and using water wheels to rush to plant seedlings. This example shows that whether cadres can set an example has a decisive significance for whether the grain unified purchase and sales policy can be correctly implemented among the masses.
    In rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work, rural grassroots cadres should earnestly pay attention to improving their work style and work methods. The State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized in the "Instructions on Intensifying the Rectification of Grain Unified Purchase and Sales Work": "The key to solving this urgent and major problem lies in deeply mobilizing the masses, in carrying out full political work and mass work, so that the masses understand the state's policies and the real way out for solving the grain problem." In the entire process of rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work, rural grassroots cadres must earnestly follow this instruction, fully mobilize the masses, and rely closely on the masses. Only in this way can we find out the grain needs of the region, eliminate the concerns of the peasants, and rationally assess the supply figures. In the process of carrying out this work, we must resolutely prevent the errors of coercion and rashness. At present, some peasants in rural areas have more concerns about the grain unified purchase and sales policy, and some of them still have some surplus grain. In rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work, we must never harm the production enthusiasm of these peasants. We must patiently publicize and explain to them, so that they can dispel their concerns and concentrate on production. We must clearly tell them that after the unified purchase of grain, they can freely dispose of the remaining grain, storing it is legal, and selling it to the state grain market is also legal, and no one can force them to take it out for "adjustment." This is a problem that all localities must pay great attention to in rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work.
    The broad masses of rural cadres must act quickly, set an example, rely on the masses, correctly implement the grain unified purchase and sales policy, and do a good job in rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work.

　　以身作则，依靠群众，作好粮食统销工作

    在整顿粮食统销工作中，农村基层干部的责任是重大的。农村基层干部是直接领导群众执行国家粮食政策的人员。国家的统销政策能否在群众中得到贯彻，主要决定于这些基层干部是否正确地执行这一政策。农村粮食统销的基本原则是：该供应的一定供应，该少供应的少供应，不该供应的一定不供应。如果把粮食供应给不缺粮食的人，或者给缺粮少的人多供应了，就必然会影响到对真正缺粮的人的合理供应。基层干部应该以对国家和群众高度负责的精神，切实根据这个原则来改进粮食统销工作，任何放任自流、推脱敷衍的作法，都会给国家和群众带来危害。
    目前农村中有些人本来不缺粮也要求供应，或者缺粮少而要求多供应，这固然是由于这些人不了解国家的政策，思想上有顾虑，想多抓一些粮食，但同时也和某些基层干部不能正确执行统销政策和徇私舞弊有很大关系。因为，如果一个干部自己多买了粮食，或者在发供应证时包庇了自己的亲友，那末他就会理短口软，就不敢“得罪人”，不可能理直气壮地去教育别人遵守粮食统销政策。只有干部以身作则地、公正无私地执行粮食统销政策，他才有向群众进行说服教育的本钱，才能举起同各种徇私舞弊、违犯粮食法令的行为进行斗争的武器。无数事实证明，如果干部以身作则，坚定地掌握粮食供应的原则，该供应的供应，该少供应的少供应，不该供应的不供应，那末群众不但不会埋怨他，而且会支持他；即使有个别的人坚持自己错误的要求，也会受到广大群众的批评和教育。这样，他也就不必耽心在整顿粮食统销工作中“得罪人”了。广东省四会县清福乡整顿粮食统销工作以前，有少数干部徇私舞弊，多买了粮食，有些群众也虚报缺粮数，要求多供应。整顿统销工作开始后，乡支部首先在党员会和干部会上向党员、干部进行教育，对乡干部莫林祖、吴天林等的徇私舞弊行为进行了批评，因而提高了党员和干部的认识，不少党员和干部带动群众自动地放弃了自己的不合理要求。结果，这个乡的粮食统销计划就由原来群众自报的二万四千五百斤减至一万五千斤。群众对调整后的粮食供应计划都很满意，生产情绪高涨，积极挖井车水抢插秧苗。这个例子说明，干部能否以身作则，对于粮食统销政策能否在群众中正确执行具有决定性的意义。
    在整顿粮食统销工作中，农村基层干部应该切实注意改进工作作风和工作方法。国务院、中共中央在“关于加紧整顿粮食统销工作的指示”中着重指出：“解决这一紧急重大问题的关键，在于深入地发动群众，在于进行充分的政治工作和群众工作，使群众明了国家的政策和解决粮食问题的真正出路。”农村基层干部在整顿粮食统销工作的全部过程中，必须切实遵照这一指示，充分发动群众，紧紧依靠群众。只有这样，才能摸清本地区粮食需要情况，才能消除农民的顾虑，才能把供应的数字评议得合理。在这一工作进行的过程中，必须坚决防止强迫命令和草率从事的错误。目前农村中有一部分农民对粮食统销政策的顾虑较多，他们之中有些人还有一部分余粮。在整顿粮食统销工作中，决不可伤害这些农民的生产积极性，对他们要耐心地进行宣传解释，使他们打消顾虑，安心生产。要清楚地告诉他们：在粮食统购以后，他们剩下的粮食完全可以自由处理，存放起来是合法的，拿到国家粮食市场上去出卖也是合法的，别人不得强迫他们拿出来“调剂”。这是各地在整顿粮食统销工作中必须十分注意的一个问题。
    广大的乡村干部要迅速行动起来，以身作则，依靠群众，正确执行粮食统销政策，把整顿粮食统销工作做好。
