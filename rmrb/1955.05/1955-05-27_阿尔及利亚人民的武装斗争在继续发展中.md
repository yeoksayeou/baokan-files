　　The Algerian People's Armed Struggle Continues to Develop
    Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The Algerian people's armed struggle against colonial rule continues to develop. On the 21st, guerrillas attacked the Anlane Valley in the Aures Mountains, and on the 22nd, they attacked Kalani, south of Khenchela. United Press International reported that these two battles were the largest launched by guerrillas against French garrisons since November 1954. The French army used field artillery and aircraft in these two battles.
    The escalation of the Algerian people's armed struggle has led the French Governor-General of Algeria, Soustelle, to admit that the 100,000 French armed forces already in Algeria are not enough to deal with the guerrillas, and he has requested additional reinforcements. The French Cabinet and the French Defense Council held a meeting on the 24th to discuss the issue of continuing to send troops to Algeria.
    The French authorities are stepping up the persecution of people participating in the national movement in Algeria. Seventy-seven people were arrested in Constantine, eighty-one were arrested in the Der Arrouchi region, and seventeen were arrested and killed in a village in Aures.
    Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. According to TASS, Paris, 22nd: Conflicts between guerrillas and French military and police forces are continuing in Algeria. The two regions of Aures and Constantine Province have become actual theaters of military operations.
    The French authorities are taking more and more military measures, and military forces have been transferred from West Germany to the Aures region. Due to incidents of Algerian soldiers defecting to the guerrillas, some Algerian units deemed "unreliable" have been transferred.
    The French authorities held a secret military conference in Biskra, attended by Algerian Governor-General Soustelle and representatives of the military and political authorities of Aures. After the meeting, Soustelle told reporters that the situation in Algeria is becoming increasingly tense and that "relentless and resolute" measures will be taken against those who oppose the French authorities in Algeria.

　　阿尔及利亚人民的武装斗争在继续发展中
    新华社二十六日讯　阿尔及利亚人民反殖民统治的武装斗争在继续发展中。游击队二十一日攻击了奥雷斯山区的安兰山谷，二十二日攻击了肯谢拉以南的卡拉尼。合众社消息说，这两次战斗是一九五四年十一月以来游击队对法国驻军发动的最大的两次战斗。法国军队在这两次战斗中使用了野炮和飞机。
    阿尔及利亚人民武装斗争的加剧使得法国驻阿尔及利亚总督苏斯戴尔承认：已经在阿尔及利亚的十万法国武装部队用来对付游击队已经不够了，他要求再增派援军。法国内阁和法国国防委员会二十四日举行会议，讨论了向阿尔及利亚继续增兵的问题。
    法国当局加紧在阿尔及利亚迫害参加民族运动的人。在君士坦丁有七十七人被捕，在德尔阿鲁希地区有八十一人被捕，在奥雷斯的一个乡村中有十七人被捕和被杀。
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社巴黎二十二日讯：阿尔及利亚境内游击队和法国军事和警察部队之间的冲突在继续进行。奥雷斯和君士坦丁省两地区已经成为实际军事行动的场所。
    法国当局正在采取越来越多的军事措施，军事部队已经从西德调往奥雷斯地区。由于发生了阿尔及利亚士兵投诚游击队的事件，某些被认为是“不可靠的”阿尔及利亚部队已经被调走。
    法国当局在彼斯克拉举行了一次秘密军事会议，参加的有阿尔及利亚总督苏斯戴尔和奥雷斯的军政当局的代表。会后，苏斯戴尔向记者说，阿尔及利亚的局势正在日益紧张，将采取“无情的坚决”措施对付那些反对在阿尔及利亚的法国当局的人们。
