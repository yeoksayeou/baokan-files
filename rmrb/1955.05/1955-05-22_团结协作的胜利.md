　　The Victory of Unity and Collaboration
　　By our reporter Li Ce
    The Chengdu Thermal Power Plant in Sichuan Province began construction in September 1954. After more than seven months, it generated electricity on April 28 this year, completing the task of generating electricity before the "May Day" target.
    This power plant was built using old and outdated equipment. The main equipment of the power plant, such as the turbine and generator, suffered serious damage from Chiang Kai-shek's bandits before the liberation of Southwest China. The bandits first set fire to the machinery and equipment on the ship with gasoline and then sank the ship in the river. After salvage, the main equipment was found, but many parts were lost or burned. Later, when power plants were built in various places, some usable parts were dismantled. Along with the construction of the plant, the repair and allocation of this incomplete set of equipment began. However, it was very difficult to find partners in major cities across the country, entrust processing and ordering, and make thousands of parts, transport them to the plant site, and assemble them.
    The design, installation, and civil construction units participating in the power plant were also newly organized teams. The designers had never designed such a large power plant. The civil construction unit had also never participated in this type of complex structure with civil construction and installation crossover operations and strict quality requirements.
    In this situation, close cooperation from all aspects of construction and construction was required to complete the construction task. However, this was not the case at the beginning of the project. The construction unit waited for the power plant to be repaired before accepting it, without actively understanding the supply of equipment and materials. The construction side waited for the equipment and materials to arrive, without actively organizing construction. At that time, it was not clear what equipment and materials were still missing and when the power plant could be repaired. At the same time, there were many errors and unclear explanations in the design drawings, often causing rework. For example, civil construction and installation were designed separately and were not connected to each other. The design of the main plant building did not take into account the weight to be borne by mechanical installation; the design of the entire plant building also neglected the strength that would be weakened after drilling for installation. Therefore, the time and method of installation were greatly restricted. There was also a lack of close coordination during the crossover operation of civil construction and installation, with each rushing to make progress and hindering each other. The scaffolding of the civil construction project hindered the installation of the entire plant's circulating water pipes; the installation of water pipes for the plant's internal light railway was blocked. The supply of materials also could not keep up with construction needs. Because the design was proposed relatively late, orders were placed based on estimates in advance. After the design was finalized, some did not meet the design requirements, and some were under-supplied or not available at all. All of this seriously threatened the quality and progress of the project, and only about 50% of the monthly plan was completed in September and October.
    These problems needed to be solved quickly. Based on the above chaotic situation, the Party Committee of the construction site first focused on the inventory of materials and equipment. What was still missing, which had already been entrusted to order, which needed to be ordered immediately, what was urgently needed now, and what would be needed in the future were all supervised by the construction unit to quickly issue a list, send special personnel to various places to check the ordering situation, and organize transportation. Then, the project progress was clarified, the main and objective conditions were carefully analyzed, and the policy of striving to generate electricity by "May Day" in 1955 was determined. According to this policy, the overall project schedule was arranged, and each unit compiled its own work plan. The Party Committee also launched a labor competition and project quality inspection among employees to ensure the quality and progress of the project.
    In order to do the above work well, the Party Committee of the construction site strengthened the collective leadership of the Party, unified the ideological understanding and work steps of each unit, required the responsible cadres of each unit to establish an overall concept, support each other, cooperate closely, and jointly overcome the difficulties of low technical level and lack of experience; and conducted education for employees.
    After doing this, the situation of continuous failure to complete the plan began to reverse. The tasks were overfulfilled in November and December 1954. The overfulfillment in December was more than 160%, which made the annual plan successfully completed. In the first quarter of this year, the Party Committee of the construction site saw that the conditions were ripe and clearly put forward the fighting goal of mobilizing employees to guarantee the completion of the "May Day" power generation.
    After the fighting goal was put forward, all units supported each other and cooperated closely to strive for its realization. It was necessary to quickly overcome the chaotic management phenomenon in construction, otherwise it would delay the project progress and affect the project quality. In order to solve this problem, during the tense crossover operation of civil construction and installation, the responsible staff of each unit insisted on holding a meeting every day, determining who would do it first and who would do it later according to the project progress. After the discussion, it was clearly explained to the employees. This prevented the practice of each unit simply pursuing its own progress and disregarding the entire project. At the same time, technical joint meetings were held twice a week, with people from design, installation, civil construction, and construction units participating to jointly discuss modifying designs, adding equipment, and determining rework and other urgent problems to be solved, and formal decisions were made on the spot. For example, when the design of the boiler platform did not leave holes for the foundation bolts of the boiler pillars, it was decided to modify the design immediately after everyone discussed it. Each unit also adopted the method of reviewing drawings to correct errors in the drawings in advance. The technicians of the construction unit carefully studied all the drawings and were responsible for explaining them clearly to the workers. In addition, a quality inspection team was established on the construction site to solve the problems left over. For example, the railing on the boiler walkway passed through the window at one end, and the steel bars on the concrete pillars of the crane were tied in the wrong direction, all of which were corrected during the inspection.
    The construction, design, and construction units adopted a proactive and helpful attitude towards each other in terms of compiling project budgets, reviewing designs, supplying materials, and construction management, and all work was handled very well. In particular, this incomplete set of equipment had been stored for many years and was severely corroded, with a large amount of repair and allocation work; the drawings and data were incomplete, the design dimensions were inconsistent, and there were many omissions; in addition, the supply of materials and equipment was not timely, which caused great difficulties for the installation work. However, the installation unit actively overcame these difficulties while installing, budgeting, and ordering goods. When the supply of equipment and materials was not timely, they sent people to Chongqing, Wuhan, and other places to help the construction unit purchase and transport them; they manufactured what they could manufacture themselves; if they could not buy it for a while, they solved it by other methods with the consent of all parties on the principle of not affecting the quality of the project. In addition to actively improving the supply of equipment, the construction unit found that the construction unit lacked lathes, welding machines, and instruments, so it tried to lend them; it also tried to take care of the diet, accommodation, and cultural and entertainment life of the construction unit's employees as much as possible. The construction units also cooperated very well with each other. The civil construction team was not familiar with pouring large concrete and had a serious quality accident when building the reservoir. The civil engineering section of the installation unit sent people to help them, promoted advanced experience, and prevented the recurrence of honeycomb, pitting, and other quality accidents. The design and installation units often modified the design and installation methods, which affected the rework of the civil construction project. However, the employees of the civil construction unit understood that basic construction was a century-old plan, and they had no complaints about the several revisions to the project.
    In order to cooperate well with other units, each construction unit worked hard to improve its management level. Before the construction, the civil construction unit organized the employees to carefully study the drawings under the leadership of the responsible technician, understand the intent of the design, and draw schematic diagrams of important parts to explain clearly to the workers; when encountering problems in the design, they immediately studied and modified them with relevant units. Therefore, rework and waste were greatly reduced, and the rework rate of the main plant building dropped straight to three ten-thousandths. In order to cooperate well with the installation unit, they implemented a concrete pouring certificate. Before pouring, they filled in the quality standards, pouring methods, and other items, and sent them to the electrical, boiler, turbine, repair, and other installation departments and quality inspection teams to solicit their opinions first. After they checked and agreed, they started pouring. They accepted the lessons learned from the quality accident of the reservoir and implemented a system of dedicated responsibilities and nameplates. Before pouring concrete, the staff and workers were specifically assigned to each person with a dedicated responsibility. The list of assignments, operating requirements, quality standards, etc. were written in detail on the sign, and the sign was hung in a conspicuous place, eliminating the phenomenon of chaotic command and unclear responsibilities. In addition, a concrete tamping registration system was implemented to strengthen the employees' political sense of responsibility. Although they participated in the construction of the power plant for the first time and lacked construction experience and technical level, they generally met the requirements of the installation and construction units in terms of construction methods and project quality with the help of all parties, humbly accepting opinions, and actively cooperating.
    Through the joint efforts of everyone, all difficulties were overcome, and this new power plant was finally put into production before this year's "May Day."

　　团结协作的胜利
　　本报记者　李策
    四川省成都市火力发电厂在一九五四年九月动工修建，经过七个多月，在今年四月二十八日发电，提前完成了预定在“五一”发电的任务。
    这座电厂是利用残旧设备修建起来的。电厂的透平、发电机等主要设备，在西南解放前，遭受了蒋贼的严重破坏，匪徒们先用汽油把放在船上的机器设备放火焚烧，接着把船炸沉在江底。打捞以后，主要设备是找到了，但许多配件却散失、烧坏了。后来，各地修建电厂时又拆去了一些能用的配件。这套残缺不全的设备，在建厂的同时，就开始了修理和配制工作。但是，要在国内各大城市找对象，委托加工、订货，把成千成万的配件做好，运到厂址，装配起来，困难是很多的。
    参加电厂的设计、安装和土建单位，也都是新组织起来的队伍。设计人员从来没有设计过这样大的电厂。土建单位也从来没有参加过这种造型结构复杂，土建和安装交叉作业，质量要求又这样严格的工程。
    在这种情况下，就需要建设和施工各方面密切协作，共同来完成修建任务。但是，在工程开始时，却完全不是这样。建设单位等待电厂修好以后验收，不积极了解器材设备供应情况。施工方面等待器材、设备到来，也不主动组织施工。当时究竟还短少什么设备和器材，电厂什么时候能够修好，大家都不清楚。同时，设计图纸差错多，交代不清，常常造成返工。如土建和安装是分别设计的，互相不衔接。主厂房的设计，没有考虑到机械安装所要负担的重量；整个厂房的设计，也忽略了安装打洞以后所要削弱的强度。因此安装的时间和方法都受到了很大的限制。土建和安装实行交叉作业时，也缺乏严密的配合，互相赶进度，互相阻碍。土建工程的脚手架妨碍了全厂内循环水管的安装；安装上下水道的水管又受到厂内轻便铁道的阻挡。材料供应也赶不上施工需要。因为设计提出较迟，事先是凭估计订货的。设计确定以后，有的不符合设计要求，有的供应不足或者根本没有。这一切都严重地威胁着工程的质量和进度，九、十两月仅完成月计划的百分之五十左右。
    这些问题都需要很快地解决。工地党委会根据以上混乱情况，首先抓紧了材料设备的摸底工作。到底还缺少什么，哪些已经委托订货了，哪些需要立即订货，现在急需什么，将来需要什么，都监督建设单位迅速开出清单来，派专人到各地检查订货情况，组织运输。然后又摸清了工程进度，仔细分析了主、客观条件，确定了争取一九五五年“五一”发电的方针，根据这个方针，安排了总的工程进度计划，各单位分别编制了自己的作业计划。党委又发动职工展开了劳动竞赛和工程质量检查，来保证工程的质量和进度。
    为了做好以上各项工作，工地党委加强了党的集体领导，统一各单位的思想认识和工作步调，要求各单位的负责干部树立整体观念，互相支援，密切协作，共同克服技术水平低和经验不足的困难；并且向职工进行了教育。
    这样做了以后，连续完不成计划的情况就开始扭转了。一九五四年十一月、十二月都超额完成了任务，十二月份超额完成百分之一百六十以上，使得全年的计划都胜利地完成了。到今年第一季度，工地党委看到条件成熟，便明确地提出了动员职工保证完成“五一”发电的奋斗目标。
    奋斗目标提出以后，各个单位都互相支援，密切协作来争取实现。施工中需要迅速克服管理混乱现象，不然就会推迟工程进度，影响工程质量。为了解决这个问题，在土建、安装紧张地交叉作业时，各单位的负责工作人员每天坚持开一次碰头会，按照工程进度情况，确定第二天谁先做，谁后做。商量好以后，向职工交代清楚。防止了各单位单纯追求自己的进度，不顾整个工程的做法。同时，每周开两次技术联席会，设计、安装、土建和建设单位都派人参加，共同讨论修改设计、添置设备以及确定返工等急待解决的问题，当场作出正式决定。例如锅炉平台上在设计时没有留下锅炉柱子的地脚螺丝洞，经大家讨论后，当即决定修改设计。各单位还采取了会审图纸的办法，事先纠正图纸上的差错。对各项图纸，施工单位的技术员都认真学习，并负责向工人交代清楚。此外，还在工地上成立了质量检查组，解决遗留下来的问题。像锅炉走台上的栏杆，有一端穿过了窗户，行车混凝土柱子上的钢筋扎反了，都在检查中纠正了。
    建设、设计、施工各单位不论在编制工程预算、审查设计、材料供应、以及施工管理等方面，都采取了主动积极互相帮助的态度，一切工作都处理得很好。特别是这套残缺不全的设备，放了多少年，锈蚀得很厉害，修配任务很大；图纸资料不齐全，设计尺寸不符，遗漏也多；再加材料、设备供应不及时，给安装工作造成很大困难。但是，安装单位在边安装，边做预算，边订货的情况下，主动克服了这些困难。器材设备供应不及时的时候，他们就派人到重庆、武汉等地帮助建设单位采购和运输；自己能制造的，就动手制造；一时买不到的，经各方面研究同意，在不影响工程质量的原则下，用其它办法解决。建设单位除了积极改善设备供应外，发现施工单位缺少车床、电焊机以及仪表等，就设法借给他们；对施工单位职工的饮食、住宿和文化娱乐生活，也尽量加以照顾。各个施工单位之间也合作得很好。土建工程队对浇灌大型混凝土不熟悉，修建蓄水池时，发生了严重的质量事故，安装单位的土木股便派人帮助他们，推广先进经验，防止了再次发生蜂窝、麻面等质量事故。设计、安装单位时常修改设计和安装方法，以致影响土建工程返工，但是土建单位的职工了解到基本建设是百年大计，几次修改工程，也毫无怨言。
    各个施工单位为了能同其他单位配合得好，都努力提高管理水平。土建单位在施工前，由主管技术员领导职工认真学习图纸，领会设计的意图，并把重要部分绘出示意图，向工人讲解清楚；碰见设计上的毛病时，立即和有关单位研究修改。因此，返工浪费大大减少，主厂房返工率直降到万分之三。为了和安装单位配合好，他们实行了混凝土浇灌证明书，在浇灌以前，把质量标准、浇灌方法等项填好，分别送到电气、锅炉、透平，修配等安装部门和质量检查组，先征求他们的意见，经过他们检查同意以后，才动手浇灌。他们接受了蓄水池质量事故的教训，实行专责分工挂牌制，浇灌混凝土以前，工作人员、工人具体分工，人人有专责，把分工的名单、操作要求、质量标准等详细地写在牌子上，把牌子挂在显而易见的地方，消除了指挥混乱、职责不清的现象。另外又实行了混凝土捣灌记名制度，加强了职工的政治责任心。虽然他们第一次参加电厂的修建工程，施工经验不足，技术水平不高，但是在各方面帮助下，虚心接受意见，主动积极地配合，施工方法和工程质量一般都符合了安装和建设单位的要求。
    经过大家的共同努力，一切困难都克服了，这座新的发电厂终于在今年“五一”以前投入了生产。
