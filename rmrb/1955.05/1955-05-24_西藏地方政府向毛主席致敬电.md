Telegram of Respect from the Local Government of Tibet to Chairman Mao

Respected Great Leader Chairman Mao:

    Today is the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. Monks and laypeople in Lhasa and major cities and towns in Tibet are celebrating enthusiastically together with the People's Liberation Army and working personnel stationed there. On this occasion, we extend our highest respects to you with boundless joy.

    Thanks to your wise leadership and that of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, great achievements have been made in the implementation of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. The unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within the Tibetan nationality itself is being strengthened day by day, and this unity is developing like a waxing crescent moon; the national defense in the southwest of the motherland is becoming increasingly consolidated; and the construction undertakings in the Tibetan region are also developing day by day. Last year, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni went to the capital of the motherland to attend the First Session of the First National People's Congress, and visited various parts of the country to see the achievements of the motherland's construction, thereby strengthening the confidence of the Tibetan monks and laypeople in striving for a happy future and building a new Tibet under the glorious light of your leadership, the Chinese Communist Party, and the correct policies of the State Council of the People's Republic of China. In the future, we will further strengthen the unity between fraternal nationalities and within the Tibetan nationality on the existing basis, faithfully abide by the Constitution and implement the agreement.

    The Kangzang and Qingzang Highways have been successfully opened to traffic. At present, the construction of the highways from Lhasa to Shigatse and from Shigatse to Gyantse is about to start in full swing. We must strive to support it and strive to open it to traffic according to the scheduled time. We must work hard to develop the political, economic, cultural and other construction undertakings of the Tibetan people, to strengthen the construction of the motherland, and to oppose the use of atomic weapons and defend Asian and world peace. We wish you a long life.

　　西藏地方政府向毛主席致敬电敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    今天是关于和平解放西藏办法的协议签订四周年纪念日，拉萨及西藏各大城镇的僧俗人民都和驻当地人民解放军、工作人员一起热烈庆祝。在此之际，我们以无比欢欣的心情谨向您致以崇高的敬礼。
    由于您和中国共产党、中央人民政府的英明的领导，和平解放西藏办法的协议的执行有了很大成绩。汉、藏民族和藏族内部的团结正日益加强，这种团结如上弦月般地日益发展；祖国西南国防日益巩固；西藏地方的建设事业也在日益发展。去年达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼前往祖国首都出席了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，并到全国各地参观了祖国建设成就，从而使西藏僧俗人民在您、中国共产党和中华人民共和国国务院的领导和正确政策的光辉照耀下，加强了为幸福前途和建设新西藏而努力的信心。今后我们将在现有基础上，进一步加强兄弟民族间和藏族内部的团结，忠诚地遵守宪法和执行协议。
    康藏、青藏公路已胜利通车，目前拉萨到日喀则、日喀则到江孜的公路即将全面动工修筑，我们一定努力支援，争取按计划规定时间通车。我们要为发展西藏人民的政治、经济、文化等各项建设事业，为加强祖国建设，为反对使用原子武器和保卫亚洲及世界和平而努力。敬祝您万寿无疆。
