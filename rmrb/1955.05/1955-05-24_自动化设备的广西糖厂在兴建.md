　　A Guangxi sugar refinery equipped with automated equipment is under construction. It is expected that the entire project will be completed this winter, and production will begin in early 1956. Workers at the construction site are now launching a labor emulation drive to complete the plant construction task ahead of schedule.

　　By the end of March this year, the factory's employee dormitories, children's school, clinic, and cafeteria, etc., have all been completed. Some workshops have also been completed; the remaining unfinished workshops are scheduled to be completed in the second quarter. Currently, the factory has shifted from civil engineering construction to comprehensive machine installation. According to the plan, the factory will complete the installation of one-quarter of all investment equipment in the second quarter.

　　Once this factory is completed, many flat wastelands nearby can be reclaimed to plant sugarcane; the nearby limestone will be utilized as the main raw material for the double carbonation method of sugar production.

　　自动化设备的广西糖厂在兴建
    一座有自动化设备的广西糖厂正在兴建。预计这个厂的全部工程将在今年冬季完工，一九五六年初投入生产。现在工地上的工人们正在展开劳动竞赛，争取提前完成建厂任务。
    到今年三月底止，这个厂的职工宿舍、子弟学校、医务室和食堂等工程，已经全部完工。一部分车间也已经完工；其他未完工的车间，计划在第二季内完成。目前这个厂已经由土木建筑工程转入全面的机器安装。根据计划，这个厂在第二季度要完成全部投资四分之一的设备的安装任务。
    这个厂建成以后，附近许多平坦的荒地，可以开辟来种甘蔗；附近的石炭岩将被利用为复式炭酸法制糖的主要原料。
