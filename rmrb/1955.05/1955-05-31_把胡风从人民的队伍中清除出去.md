Expel Hu Feng from the Ranks of the People
Li Ni

From the materials concerning the Hu Feng anti-Party clique disclosed in the "People's Daily" on May 13th and May 24th, it is already very clear that the true face of the Hu Feng clique is anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary. As a literary worker, as a Chinese person, one cannot help but feel boundless anger towards this extremely dangerous enemy of the people who has been hiding for a long time. I fully endorse the resolution of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on May 25th, and resolutely expel Hu Feng from the ranks of the people. We must thoroughly investigate the criminal activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique so that they have nowhere to hide.

For twenty years, Hu Feng has been disguising himself as a Marxist literary theorist, disguising himself as a friend of the people, and claiming to be a "supporter of realism" and an "organizer of literary work standing around the Party." It is under this disguise that he has been spreading the extremely reactionary toxins of bourgeois subjective idealism for a long time and carrying out extremely despicable and unspeakable destructive activities. Now, things are very clear: Hu Feng's reactionary literary theory is by no means merely an error in theoretical understanding, as he pretends, but a deliberate, premeditated distortion, slander, and destruction of Marxist literary theory and the entire literary and art cause led by the Party. All the despicable activities of his group are not merely due to so-called "sectarian emotions," but an organized, planned, and strategic anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary conspiracy.

From the revealed materials, it can be clearly seen that Hu Feng is extremely hateful of everything that the people love, support, are proud of, and feel happy about. Hu Feng deeply hates the Party that the people love, the literary and art movement led by the Party, the literary and art policies put forward by Chairman Mao, all progressive writers and literary workers, both Party members and non-Party members, and even anyone who wants to make progress and is willing to accept the leadership, education, and influence of the Party. From Hu Feng's secret letters, it can be clearly seen that the true face of this hidden enemy, who is resolutely opposed to the Party, the people, and the revolution, is very ugly and very hideous! His mad hatred for the Party, the people, and the revolution is no different from that of the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agent bandit gang. However, for twenty years, Hu Feng has always disguised himself as a friend of the people and burrowed into the revolutionary ranks, attempting to carry out destructive activities from within. The Hu Feng anti-Party clique is the most ferocious and insidious enemy of the people, but even this Hu Feng dared to shamelessly submit a so-called "opinion letter" to the Party Central Committee, attempting to disguise himself as a follower of the Party to undermine the great cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction in our country!

The exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique's conspiracy is a great victory for the Party and a great victory for the people. With the victory of our people's revolutionary cause and the increasingly vigorous progress of our socialist transformation and socialist construction, the class struggle is becoming more complex and sharper, and the conspiratorial activities of class enemies are becoming more rampant and crazier. We can see very clearly that just when the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, are working enthusiastically and rejoicing for the cause of socialist construction in our country, the Hu Feng anti-Party clique is "sharpening its sword," "peering at the direction," establishing "strongholds," and expanding "strength." They are gathering intelligence, stealing documents, and are always trying to break into the Party and infiltrate the revolutionary organizations to carry out a set of "Sun Wukong's tactics of drilling into the stomach." We can see very clearly that the class enemies are not sleeping: Hu Feng, even though he "plays dead" on the surface, is in fact always planning strategic and tactical advances and retreats, and is always commanding his minions, and deploying attacks against the Party and the people.

We know that class enemies will never lay down their weapons easily, especially cunning enemies like the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, enemies who hate the Party and the people so madly, and enemies with a long history of counter-revolutionary activities.

Therefore, every literary worker must, under the leadership of the Party, and together with the people of the whole country, continue to carry out a merciless struggle and thorough exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique. We must be vigilant and remove all hidden elements who pretend to be revolutionary but are actually against the revolution from our ranks!

　　把胡风从人民的队伍中清除出去
　　丽尼
    从“人民日报”五月十三日和五月二十四日所揭露的关于胡风反党集团的材料，已经可以很清楚地看出胡风集团反党、反人民、反革命的真实面貌。作为一个文艺工作者，作为一个中国人，对于这种长期隐蔽暗藏的极危险的人民敌人，是不能不感到无比愤怒的。我完全拥护五月二十五日中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，坚决把胡风从人民的队伍中清除出去；我们必须对于胡风反党集团的罪恶活动彻底追查，使其无所隐遁。
    二十年来，胡风一直把自己伪装成一个马克思主义文艺理论家，伪装成人民的朋友，自命为“现实主义的坚持者”、“站在党的周围的文学工作的组织者”；他就是在这样的伪装之下长期地传播着极反动的资产阶级主观唯心论的毒素，进行着极卑劣的不可以告人的破坏活动。现在，事情已经很清楚：胡风的反动文艺理论决不像他所伪装的那样仅仅是一种理论认识上的错误，而是对于马克思主义文艺理论、对于党所领导的整个文艺事业的有意的、处心积虑的歪曲、诬蔑和破坏；他的集团的一切卑劣活动决不仅仅由于一种所谓“宗派情绪”，而是一种有组织、有计划、有战略策略的反党、反人民、反革命的阴谋。
    从已经揭露的材料可以清楚地看出，凡是人民所心爱、所拥护、所引为骄傲、感到幸福的一切，胡风都是极端仇恨的。对于人民所热爱的党，对于党所领导的文艺运动，对于毛主席提出的文艺方针，对于党和非党的一切进步作家和文艺工作者，甚至对于凡是要求进步、愿意接受党的领导、教育和影响的人，胡风都是深恶痛绝，不共戴天的。从胡风的密信里可以清楚地看出，这个坚决同党、同人民、同革命为敌的暗藏敌人的真实面目，是十分丑恶，十分狰狞的！他对于党、对于人民、对于革命的疯狂仇视，是和美蒋特务匪帮丝毫也没有差别的。然而，二十年来，胡风却始终把自己伪装成一个人民的朋友，并且钻进了革命内部，企图从内部来进行破坏活动。胡风反党集团是人民的最凶恶、最阴险的敌人，但是，就是这个胡风，他还竟敢厚颜无耻地向党中央提出什么“意见书”，妄图伪装成党的追随者来破坏我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的伟大事业！
    对于胡风反党集团阴谋的揭露，是党的伟大胜利，是人民的伟大胜利。随着我国人民革命事业的胜利，我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的日益蓬勃进展，阶级斗争也愈趋复杂，愈趋尖锐，阶级敌人的阴谋活动也就愈猖獗，愈疯狂。我们可以很清楚地看到，正当全国人民，在党的领导之下，为着我国社会主义建设事业而热情劳动，而欢欣鼓舞的时候，胡风反党集团却在“磨剑”，在“窥测方向”，在建立“据点”，扩充“实力”；他们打探情报，偷窃文件，随时都在企图打进党内，混入革命团体的内部，施展一套“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”。我们可以很清楚地看到，阶级敌人并没有昏睡：胡风仅管表面上“装死”，但事实上随时都在策划攻守进退的战略战术，随时都在指挥他的喽罗，布置对党、对人民的进攻。
    我们知道，阶级敌人是决不会随便放下武器的，特别像胡风反党集团这样狡诈的敌人，这样疯狂地仇恨党、仇恨人民的敌人，这样有着长时期反革命活动经验的敌人，更是不可能随便放下武器的。
    因此，我们每一个文艺工作者，必须在党的领导下，和全国人民一起，继续进行对于胡风反党集团的无情斗争和彻底揭露。我们必须提高警惕，把一切伪装革命而实际上反对革命的暗藏分子从我们的队伍中清除出去！
