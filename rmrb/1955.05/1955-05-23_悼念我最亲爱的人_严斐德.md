In Memory of My Dearest - Fredi Urchs
　　Wang Wu'an

　　On the morning of the 12th, just as I finished breakfast and cheerfully picked up my small bag, ready to go to the office, the telephone suddenly rang. It was a call from the Press Liaison Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying they needed to see me immediately to discuss something. I listened almost suffocated as the comrade from the Press Liaison Office solemnly and slowly conveyed to me: "...The Indian International Airways charter plane carrying the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference suddenly exploded and caught fire en route from Hong Kong to Jakarta. Fredi Urchs..."

　　The terrible news, like an electric shock, swiftly and severely struck me, plunging me into a sudden paralysis. I felt as if time had stopped. Fredi's kind face appeared before my eyes, his sharp gaze, his broad shoulders, sturdy arms, and his humorous yet incisive discussions… Everything still clearly surrounded my mind. Just ten days ago, he was still around me, discussing his reporting plans for the Asian-African Conference and his work plans after the conference. Indeed, we often felt that our life goals were so great and clear, the content of life was so rich and interesting, and our small family was so happy and fulfilling.

　　Since the bad news came, I have stayed by the radio and telephone day and night, unwilling to give up even the last ray of hope. But the final news finally confirmed that Fredi and other comrades had all been sacrificed due to a premeditated conspiracy by the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek special agent group. Fredi was murdered by the enemy.

　　In 1929, on the day Fredi received his doctorate in medicine in Vienna, he also gloriously joined the Austrian Communist Party, and from then on, he dedicated his young life to the revolutionary cause of human liberation. He understood that a progressive doctor, although he could use his skills to help the working people, the most fundamental issue was to eliminate the social system of human exploitation to thoroughly eliminate the suffering of the working people. Therefore, he not only went back and forth between hospitals and patients, but he also went in and out of prisons and battlefields, fighting for the great cause of mankind. As a doctor and a fighter for human liberation, in 1936, he joined the Spanish anti-fascist battlefield. In 1939, he came to China's anti-Japanese battlefield after many twists and turns. After the end of World War II, he returned to his hometown of Vienna, which he had been away from for more than ten years, with the heart of a soldier returning home. But no hospital dared to easily accept him - an anti-fascist fighter who had been away from his hometown for a long time. Thus, he bravely took up another weapon he loved - the pen - and launched the first shot at Europe - writing the book "China's Victory." After that, he joined the ranks of journalism, faithfully reporting for the people and boldly exposing the deceptive conspiracies of imperialism and its agents.

　　In 1953, he came to China again as a reporter for the "People's Voice of Austria." In the past two years, he has been to Korea, Vietnam, Geneva, and the recently liberated Dachen Islands.

　　Fredi was always serious, responsible, and happy to take on the revolutionary cause.

　　His work was usually very focused, and his energy was very abundant. He often worked at his desk for twelve hours at a stretch, with few opportunities for activity and rest. He was able to obey the needs of his work and immerse himself in hard work.

　　As a medical worker, he had excellent professional skills and organizational abilities. On the anti-fascist battlefields in Spain and China, he never shied away from difficulties and hardships, striving to do more work and do it well. Whenever the fighting was at its most intense, he always went deep into the front lines to direct and rescue the wounded and sick. Whenever the bombing and strafing were at their fiercest, he personally took charge of the surgery, calming other medical personnel and wounded soldiers. In extremely harsh material conditions, he always worked hard and confidently to complete his tasks. He could also use the gaps to write his poems, praising the heroic deeds of the soldiers he came into contact with. From Vienna to Beijing, from Beijing to Vienna, we often met countless comrades who extended friendly hands to him. They had all received his help and comfort in the most difficult times.

　　As a journalist, Fredi was very humble and faithful to his duties. On the eve of his departure for Hong Kong this time, he said to a young reporter: "In the ranks of journalists, I am still very young, and I need your help. I want to learn from you..." These words are still clearly in my memory.

　　He was very attentive to the Party's intentions in his work, and he often tried to make his work conform to the Party's requirements. In the process of his reporting or writing, whenever comrades put forward opinions, he always considered them very humbly, carefully revised and supplemented them, and strived to conform to the Party's policies.

　　Fredi was sincere and loyal to his comrades. Especially when people needed his help, he was always warm and selfless in helping them. But if he found that the other party's position or method was wrong, he would sharply criticize it. He was very familiar with the lives and work of the worker-peasant brothers and understood their likes and dislikes. He was good at using the simplest language to explain Marxism-Leninism to the worker-peasant comrades, and at the same time, he was good at learning from the worker-peasant comrades' advantages, so the masses who came into contact with him all liked him very much.

　　Fredi was a staunch proletarian fighter. He was a good comrade who could adhere to the Party's principles and standpoints. In his twenty-five years of combat life, he had waged unyielding struggles against the persecution of enemies inside and outside the Party, the bourgeoisie, and its agents in difficult environments. What impressed me most in this regard was that during the years when he participated in the Spanish Revolutionary War, he firmly and bravely carried out a tenacious struggle against various assassination activities of traitors without being discouraged at all. He firmly believed that the Marxist-Leninist Party was always correct. He finally got the greatest honor—awards and medals.

　　Today, Fredi's blood is flowing together with that of the Chinese comrades, which is by no means accidental. Fredi loved China as much as he loved his own country. He regarded the suffering of the Chinese people as his own suffering. He regarded the victory of the Chinese people as a force that could be instilled into the working people of his own country. Therefore, he shouldered the cause of the Chinese people's struggle for a bright future. Especially in recent years, whether in Europe or Asia, he has used his pen as a bugle, everywhere for the construction of new China, paving the roads full of flowers, and blowing the song of appealing to people. Fredi contributed himself to the Chinese people, and also tried to use the new vitality of the Chinese people to enrich himself, and through himself, spread it to the European people. His work and life for more than 20 years have been closely linked with the Chinese people, and he has an unparalleled class friendship and a high degree of internationalism.

　　To measure Fredi's life by the basic conditions necessary for a glorious Communist Party member, it can be said that he was an excellent son of the working class. From the first day he stepped into the vanguard of the proletariat, for twenty-five years as one day, he never cared about personal gains and losses, and was not afraid of any sacrifice. He was resolute and brave, and put the collective interest in the first place of his personal life. From the perspective of his life's path and direction, it is in complete compliance with his original will when he swore to join the Party to shed his last drop of blood for the cause of human peace and happiness. He emitted the light he should have emitted in the cause of human liberation, and he is a glorious example in the revolutionary ranks.

　　Today, as if in a dream, I am lying on the desk used by my dearest person to write an article mourning him. The enemy has severely injured me this time. My tears have not yet dried, and the blood is still flowing, but I have the greatest determination to immediately return to my work post and inherit his efforts for the cause of human liberation. I know that in the years to come, terrible loneliness and loneliness will often disturb me, but they cannot damage my will to demand repayment of blood debts in the slightest. I deeply feel the strength given to me by the Party and comrades. I have experienced the great support given to us, the bereaved families, by honest people all over the world in this incident. I also know that the true happiness of mankind does not fall from the sky, but must be exchanged for by struggle and blood. Many martyrs have fallen one after another for their great ideals and for the establishment of a new society without human exploitation. I should feel honored and proud that Fredi is included in this great ranks of heroes, and I should make myself more courageous and resolute to make a greater determination to embark on the revolutionary road.

　　Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the comrades in Beijing, Vienna, Berlin and other places, and to the comrades and readers who were friendly to Fredi before his death, for the condolences and concern given to me in this incident. From the letters and telegrams piled up on my desk, I feel pairs of kind and friendly hands reaching out to me. They want to help me through the difficult days, and they will always push me forward. I would like to assure the comrades who care about me that I will turn grief into strength, inherit Fredi's cause, and contribute the last drop of blood to the happiness of mankind.

　　悼念我最亲爱的人——严斐德
　　王务安
    十二号的清晨，正当我用完早点，愉快地提着小包打算到办公室去的时候，忽然电话铃响了，是外交部记者联络处来的电话，他们说有事要我立即去面谈。我几乎窒息了似地静听着记者联络处的同志沉重而缓慢地向我转达：“……中国出席亚非会议代表团所包乘的印度国际航空公司专机，在香港飞往雅加达的途中突然爆炸起火，严斐德……”
    恶耗像电流一样，迅速地严重地袭击了我，使我突然陷入麻痹，我觉得时间也好像停顿了一样。斐德亲切的容貌呈现在我的眼前，他那锐敏的眼光，他那宽阔的肩膀，结实的胳膊，和他那幽默而锋利的谈论……一切还是那末清楚地环绕在我的脑际。只不过十天以前，他还在我的周围，谈论着他对于亚非会议的报道计划及亚非会议以后的工作计划。确实，我们常常感到自己生活的目标是那末伟大而清楚，生活内容是那末丰富而有趣，而我们这个小家庭又是多么幸福美满呵。
    自从恶耗传来后，我不分昼夜地守候在无线电和电话机旁，我总不甘心放弃即使是最后的一线希望。但最后的消息终于证实，斐德和其他同志由于美帝国主义者和蒋介石特务集团预先布置的阴谋而全体牺牲了。斐德被敌人谋杀了。
      一九二九年，当斐德在维也纳荣获医学博士学位的那一天，他也光荣地参加了奥地利共产党，从此他把他年青的生命献给了谋人类解放的革命事业。他懂得一个进步的医生，虽然可以以他的技术去帮助劳动人民，但最根本的问题是要消灭人剥削人的社会制度，才能彻底消除劳动人民的痛苦，所以他不仅在医院和病人之间回转，他也出入于监狱和战场，为人类美好的事业而奋斗。作为一个医生和谋人类解放事业的战士，一九三六年，他投入了西班牙反法西斯的战场。一九三九年又辗转来到中国的抗日战场。二次世界大战结束，他怀着战士重归家园的心情，回到他离别十多年的家乡——维也纳。但是没有一个医院敢轻易接受他——一个久离家乡的反法西斯的战士。这样，他勇敢地拿起了另一个他所热爱的武器——笔杆，向欧洲发出了第一炮——写出了中国的胜利一书。以后，他就参加了新闻工作的行列，忠实地为人民报道，大胆地揭露帝国主义和他的代理人的欺骗阴谋。
    一九五三年他又以“奥地利人民之声”报记者的身分来到了中国。最近两年来，他曾去过朝鲜、越南、日内瓦以及最近解放的大陈岛等地。
    对待革命工作的事业，斐德一向是认真负责的，胜任愉快的。
    他平常的工作很集中，精力很充沛，他常常伏在书桌上，一工作就是十二小时，很少活动和休息的机会。他能服从工作需要，埋头苦干。
    作为一个医务工作者，他有很好的业务才能和组织才能。在西班牙和中国的反法西斯的战场上，他从不辞艰难困苦，争取多做工作和做好工作。每当战斗最激烈的时候，他总是深入火线，指挥和抢救伤病员。每当轰炸扫射最猛烈的时候，他都要亲自掌握手术，镇静其他医务人员和伤病战士。在物质条件十分恶劣的情况下，他总是努力地有信心地去完成任务。他还能利用空隙去写他的诗篇，歌颂那些他所接触到的战士们的英勇事迹。我们从维也纳到北京，从北京到维也纳，常常碰到无数同志，向他伸出亲切的手，他们都是在最困难的时候，曾经得到过他的帮助和安慰。
    作为一个新闻工作者来说，斐德是非常谦虚和忠于职责的。他这次动身去香港的前夕，还和一个年青的记者说：“在新闻工作者的队伍里，我还很年轻，需要你们的帮助，我要向你们学习……”现在这些话还清楚地留在我的记忆里。
    他在工作中十分专心体会党的意图，常常努力使自己的工作符合党的要求。在他报道或写作的过程中，每当同志们提出意见时，他总是很虚心地考虑，仔细修改补充，力求符合党的政策。
      斐德对待同志，是诚恳而忠实的。特别当人们需要他的帮助时，他总是热诚地忘我地去帮助人。但如当他发现对方的立场或方法上有错误时，他就会十分尖锐地提出批评。他非常熟悉工农兄弟的生活和工作，懂得他们的爱好和厌恶。他善于用最浅显的语言向工农同志讲解马克思列宁主义，同时也善于学习工农同志的优点，所以和他接触的群众都很喜欢他。
      斐德是一个坚强的无产阶级的战士。他是一个能坚持党的原则和立场的好同志。在二十五年的战斗生活中，他曾在困难的环境中同党内外的敌人、资产阶级及其代理人的迫害作过不屈不挠的斗争。这方面给我印象最深的就是他在参加西班牙革命战争的年月里，曾坚决英勇地同叛徒的各种暗害活动进行顽强的斗争，一点也不沮丧。他坚信马克思列宁主义的党永远是正确的。他终于得到了最大的荣誉——嘉奖和勋章。
    今天斐德和中国同志们的鲜血流在一起，决不是偶然的事。斐德爱中国正像爱他自己的祖国一样，他把中国人民的苦难，当作自己的苦难。他把中国人民的胜利，作为可以灌输给自己国家劳动人民新生的一种力量。因此，他把中国人民争取美好远景的事业，分担在自己的肩上。特别是近年来，无论在欧洲和亚洲，他把笔杆当作号角，到处为新中国的建设，铺满花朵的道路，吹起感召人们的歌声。斐德把自己贡献给中国人民，也努力把中国人民新生的活力用来丰富自己，通过自己把它流传到欧洲人民中去。他二十多年来的工作和生活是同中国人民血肉相连的，他具有无比的阶级友爱和高度的国际主义精神。
    以一个光荣的共产党员所必备的基本条件来衡量斐德的一生，可以说他是工人阶级的一个优秀儿子。自从他跨进无产阶级先锋队的第一天起，二十五年来如一日，他从不计较个人得失，不怕任何牺牲，坚决勇敢，把集体利益放在个人生活的第一位。从他一生的道路和方向来看，他把自己最后的
  一滴血为人类争取和平幸福的事业而流出，是完全符合他入党宣誓时的最初意志的。他在争取人类解放的事业中发出了他应有的光芒，他是革命队伍中的光辉范例。
    今天我像在梦幻中一样，伏在我最亲爱的人所用惯的书桌上，来写哀悼他的文章。敌人这次重重打伤了我。我的泪还未干，血还在流，但是我有最大的决心，必须立刻回到自己的工作岗位上去，继承他为人类解放事业所作的努力。我知道，在今后的年月里，可怕的孤独和寂寞是会常常打扰我的，但是它们不能丝毫损害我要求偿还血债的意志。我深深地感觉到党和同志们给予我的力量。我体验到全世界正直人们在这次事件中所给予我们受难家属的伟大支持。我也知道人类的真正幸福不是从天下降，而是要依靠斗争和鲜血去换来的。多少烈士们为着他们伟大的理想，为着建立没有人剥削人的新社会，前仆后继地倒下。我应为斐德列入这一伟大的英雄行列而感到光荣和骄傲，我应该使自己为更勇敢、坚决地踏上革命的道路下更大的决心。
    这里，我愿向北京、维也纳、柏林和其他各地同志们和斐德生前友好的同志和读者们，在这次事件中所给予我的慰问和关怀表示最衷心的感谢。从我桌上堆满的信件和电文中，我感觉到一双双亲切的友谊的手伸向着我，他们要帮助我渡过困难的时日，也将永远推动着我前进。我愿向关心我的同志们保证，我将化悲痛为力量，继承着斐德的事业，为争取人类的幸福贡献出最后的一滴血。
