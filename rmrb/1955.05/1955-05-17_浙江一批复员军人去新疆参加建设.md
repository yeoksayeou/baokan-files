　　A Batch of Demobilized Soldiers from Zhejiang Go to Xinjiang to Participate in Construction

　　Around May 10th, 238 motor vehicle drivers, mechanics, sheet metal workers, electricians, etc., from Zhejiang Province departed from Hangzhou in three batches to participate in the construction of the Northwest of the motherland in Xinjiang Province. They were selected from the demobilized construction soldiers in Zhejiang Province. According to the results of the automobile driving test taken by 196 people, more than 90 percent achieved excellent results. More than 27 percent of them are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, and many are meritorious and model soldiers from the army. They were once heroic soldiers on the national defense transportation line and will become a strong force in the socialist construction of the motherland in the future.

　　The recruited automobile drivers and mechanics feel honored and excited to be able to participate in the construction of the border areas of the motherland. They have written letters of determination and guarantees to the organization, expressing their intention to contribute the greatest strength to the socialist construction of the motherland and to support the liberation of Taiwan, and to complete the glorious task assigned by the Party and the government with practical actions.

　　Before they left Hangzhou, the responsible comrades of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs spoke to them separately, encouraging them to establish new merits in the great construction of developing the great Northwest of the motherland.

　　This time, a batch of demobilized soldiers, automobile drivers, and mechanics from Zhejiang Province were absorbed to work in Xinjiang Province because the Xinjiang Provincial Transportation Company conscientiously implemented the state's policy on resettling demobilized construction soldiers and attached importance to the positive significance of absorbing demobilized soldiers to participate in work. After the work team dispatched by Xinjiang Province arrived in Zhejiang, it studied and determined with the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to give priority to absorbing demobilized construction soldiers in the recruitment quota.

　　浙江一批复员军人去新疆参加建设
    五月十日前后，浙江省有二百三十八名汽车驾驶员和机工、钣金工、电工等，先后分三批从杭州出发，到新疆省参加祖国西北的建设工作。他们是从浙江省复员建设军人当中考选出来的。据一百九十六人参加汽车驾驶考试的结果，其中百分之九十以上成绩优良。他们之中共产党员和青年团员占总数的百分之二十七以上，很多是部队的功臣、模范。他们曾经是国防运输线上的英勇战士，今后将成为祖国社会主义建设中的一支强大力量。
    被录取的汽车驾驶员和机工，都以自己能参加祖国边疆建设感到光荣和兴奋。他们纷纷向组织上写了决心书、保证书，表示要为祖国社会主义建设、为支援解放台湾贡献最大的力量，用实际行动来完成党和政府交给的光荣任务。
    在他们离开杭州前夕，浙江省民政厅负责同志分别向他们讲了话，勉励他们在开发祖国大西北的伟大建设中，建立新的功勋。
    这次浙江省一批复员军人汽车驾驶员和机工被吸收去新疆省工作，是由于新疆省交通运输公司认真贯彻了国家关于安置复员建设军人的政策，重视了吸收复员军人参加工作的积极意义。新疆省派遣的工作队到达浙江后，同浙江省民政厅研究确定，在录用名额中优先吸收复员建设军人。（周定邦）
