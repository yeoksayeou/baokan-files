(I)
    During the discussions between the Soviet and Austrian delegations on April 12-15, 1955, regarding the issue of concluding the Austrian State Treaty as soon as possible, it was noted that the statements made by Soviet government officials, First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov, and Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers A.I. Mikoyan, Austrian Chancellor, Engineer Julius Raab, Vice-Chancellor Dr. Adolf Schärf, Foreign Minister, Engineer Leopold Figl, and Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Bruno Kreisky, will express concern due to the signing of the Austrian State Treaty for the following decisions and measures to be taken by the Austrian Federal Government:
    1. The Austrian Federal Government will issue a declaration on making Austria assume international obligations, in the spirit of the statement made at the Berlin Conference in 1954 regarding not participating in military alliances and not allowing the establishment of military bases on its territory: Austria will permanently maintain neutrality like Switzerland.
    2. The Austrian Federal Government will submit this Austrian declaration to the Austrian Parliament in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Constitution, so that a resolution on this declaration can be passed immediately after the Austrian State Treaty is ratified.
    3. The Federal Government will take all corresponding steps to ensure that the declaration approved by the Austrian Parliament obtains international recognition.
    4. The Austrian Federal Government will welcome the guarantees offered by the Four Powers for the integrity and inviolability of Austria's national territory.
    5. The Austrian Federal Government will recommend that the governments of France, Britain, and the United States issue a statement on the Four Powers providing such guarantees.
    6. After the German assets in the Soviet occupation zone are handed over to Austria, the Federal Government will take measures to ensure that these assets are not transferred to the property of foreign citizens, including legal persons under private or public law. In addition, the Federal Government will be concerned that no discriminatory measures are taken against the staff of the former USIA enterprises, the enterprises of the former Soviet Oil Administration, the Oil Products Trading Joint Stock Company, and the enterprises of the "DDSG" company.
      (II)
    Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers V.M. Molotov and A.I. Mikoyan, noting the statement of the Austrian government delegation, hereby issue the following statement on behalf of the Soviet government:
    1. The Soviet government is willing to sign the Austrian State Treaty immediately.
    2. The Soviet government agrees that after the Austrian State Treaty comes into effect, the occupation forces of the four countries will completely withdraw from Austria no later than December 31, 1955.
    3. The Soviet government believes that Articles 6, 11, 15, 16(b), and 36 are outdated or superfluous, and is therefore willing to abolish these articles. Similarly, if Austria abandons its demands on the Soviet Union regarding so-called "non-military occupation expenses," the Soviet government is also willing to abolish Article 48(b). In addition, it supports the Austrian government's efforts to further amend certain clauses of the draft Austrian State Treaty and agrees to such amendments. However, it should be agreed that negotiations between the four countries and Austria on signing the Austrian State Treaty should not be unnecessarily delayed due to proposals to amend the treaty.
    4. The Soviet government is prepared to recognize the declaration on Austrian neutrality.
    5. The Soviet government is prepared, together with the three major powers, to provide guarantees for the integrity and inviolability of Austrian territory, taking Switzerland as an example.
    (III)
    After an exchange of views, the following agreements were reached:
    Regarding the issue of Austria delivering goods to the Soviet Union to pay for the Soviet enterprises in Austrian territory transferred to Austria in accordance with Article 35 of the Austrian State Treaty (Article 22 in the final version of the Austrian State Treaty).
    1. The Soviet government, in accordance with its agreement expressed at the Berlin Conference in 1954, will fully convert the total amount of 150 million US dollars stipulated in Article 35 (i.e., Article 22) of the Austrian State Treaty into goods from Austria.
    2. The Soviet delegation noted the Austrian delegation's statement that it agrees to take the list of goods proposed by the Soviet delegation as the basis, and for this purpose, the Austrian government's plenipotentiary representative will arrive in Moscow no later than the end of May this year to discuss.
    3. The Soviet delegation also noted the following statement from the Austrian delegation: The Austrian government will establish a special committee responsible for the timely and good supply of goods to the Soviet Union with a value of 150 million US dollars agreed by both parties, supplying 25 million US dollars of goods each year.
    4. The Austrian delegation expressed its willingness to provide convenient conditions for representatives of Soviet orderers to inspect and receive the goods supplied to the Soviet Union as repayment of the above-mentioned payment. It is stipulated that the goods will be delivered on the Austrian border at world prices, free of shipping costs. The prices and quantities of the goods will be determined by both parties three months before the next year each year. The Austrian bank will issue a guarantee check for 150 million US dollars to guarantee the supply of goods stipulated in the Austrian State Treaty. The checks of the Austrian bank will be gradually recovered according to the quantity of goods delivered during the payment.
    Regarding the issue of handing over the Soviet-owned oil enterprises in Austria to Austria.
    1. The Soviet delegation accepted the following suggestion from the Austrian delegation: The Austrian government will compensate for the transfer of Soviet-owned oil fields and refineries to Austria by supplying the Soviet Union with crude oil, supplying one million tons of crude oil annually for ten years, totaling ten million tons in ten years.
    The Soviet delegation noted the following statement from the Austrian delegation: The Austrian government will have the right to supply the Soviet Union with the above-mentioned quantity of oil in a shorter period of time. The oil will be delivered on the Austrian border, free of shipping costs, taxes, and tariffs.
    2. The Austrian delegation noted the following explanation from the Soviet delegation: Among the oil enterprises and oil fields transferred by the Soviet Union to Austria, refineries and the Oil Products Trading Joint Stock Company are also included.

    Regarding trade between the Soviet Union and Austria.
    1. The two sides reached an agreement on the following: The conclusion of a five-year trade treaty between the Soviet Union and Austria, which will automatically extend its validity if neither party declares the treaty invalid upon its expiration.
    2. It was also agreed that a five-year barter and payment agreement will be concluded between Austria and the Soviet Union, and the quantity of goods will be negotiated annually.
