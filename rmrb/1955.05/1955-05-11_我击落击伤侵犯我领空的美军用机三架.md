Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 10th—Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force planes shot down and damaged three U.S. military aircraft that violated our Northeast airspace.

　　At 10:16 on May 10th, eight U.S. Air Force F-86 jet fighters intruded into the airspace over Dagushan, Shicheng Island, and Dalu Island, southwest of Andong City, Liaoning Province, from the direction of South Korea. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force immediately took off to intercept them. At 10:25, our air force planes engaged the invading U.S. aircraft in air combat five kilometers west of Dalu Island, shooting down one and damaging two. The U.S. planes then fled towards South Korea.

　　Sources here point out: The U.S. authorities, disregarding the repeated serious warnings of the Chinese people, have blatantly violated our airspace, which is a serious military provocation against the Chinese people. The Chinese People's Liberation Army will resolutely strike at the aggressors in order to defend the motherland's territory and sovereignty. The U.S. authorities must bear all the serious consequences and full responsibility arising therefrom.

　　我击落击伤侵犯我领空的美军用机三架
    新华社北京十日讯　中国人民解放军空军飞机击落和击伤侵犯我国东北领空的美国军用飞机三架。
    十日十时十六分，美国空军F—八六型喷气飞机八架，由南朝鲜方向侵入我国辽宁省安东市西南方向的大孤山、石城岛、大鹿岛等地上空，中国人民解放军空军飞机当即起飞迎击。十时二十五分，我空军飞机在大鹿岛以西五公里处上空，与入侵的美国飞机发生空战，并将其中一架击落，二架击伤，美机即向南朝鲜方向逃去。
    此间人士指出：美国当局不顾中国人民一再严重警告，公然侵犯我国领空，是对中国人民的严重军事挑衅。中国人民解放军为了保卫祖国的领土和主权，必定给予侵略者以坚决打击。美国当局必须承担由此所产生的一切严重后果和全部责任。
