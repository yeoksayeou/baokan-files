　　Thai Troops and British Colonial Authorities
　　Jointly Suppress the Malayan People's Liberation Movement
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st - TASS reported from New York on the 20th: United Press International reports that Thai military authorities and British colonial authorities in Malaya are currently taking joint military action to suppress the Malayan People's Liberation Movement. UPI, citing sources from Bangkok, said that a portion of Thai army paratroopers have been deployed to the border region to support the British colonial authorities' "suppression" forces in Malaya.
    UPI acknowledged that despite all the efforts of the colonialists, the number of guerrillas fighting in Malaya and Singapore for the past eight years has not decreased at all. The news agency admitted that the close ties between the guerrillas and the local people are one of the reasons for the consolidation of this people's movement.

    新华社二十一日讯　据塔斯社纽约二十日讯；合众社报道，泰国军事当局和马来亚英国殖民当局目前正在采取联合军事行动以镇压马来亚人民解放运动。合众社援引曼谷发出的消息说，泰国军队的一部分伞兵已经被投到边境地区去支援马来亚英国当局的“讨伐”队伍。
    合众社承认，尽管殖民者作了种种努力，八年来在马来亚和新加坡作战的游击队人数一点也没有减少。这家通讯社承认，游击队同当地人民的密切联系是这一人民运动之所以巩固的一个原因。
