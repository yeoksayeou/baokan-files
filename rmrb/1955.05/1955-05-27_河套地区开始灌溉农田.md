　　Irrigation of Farmland Begins in the Hetao Area

    In the Hetao area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, irrigation of farmland has begun, and the Yellow River water is flowing onto the green Hetao Plain. More than 13,000 Mongolian and Han workers in this area began constructing 98 projects in mid-April, including water diversion channels, dams, and canal outlets. This enables more than 1.2 million mu of wheat fields and more than 3 million mu of summer fields, paddy fields, pastures, and woodlands to receive timely and adequate irrigation. Before irrigation, many mutual aid and cooperation organizations and individual farmers worked day and night to dig small canals along the fields, level the land, and cultivate the wheat fields. Most agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have also selected water conservancy committee members to be specifically responsible for irrigation work, and they have also absorbed nearby individual farmers to form temporary collective watering groups in order to save manpower and water. Some villages have also held irrigation user meetings to discuss water distribution, rational irrigation, and mutual assistance, and to formulate water conservation covenants. (Xinhua News Agency)

　  河套地区开始灌溉农田
    内蒙古自治区河套地区开始放水灌溉农田，黄河河水正流到绿色的河套平原上。这个地区一万三千多蒙、汉族民工，在四月中旬就开始修筑引水渠道、闸坝和堵放渠口等九十八项工程，使一百二十多万亩麦田和三百多万亩夏田、稻田、牧场和林地，能够得到适时和适量的灌溉。在灌溉前，许多互助合作组织和单干农民，不分昼夜地在田边挖修小渠，在田里平地打堰，并把麦田锄了一遍。大部分农业生产合作社和互助组还选出了水利委员，专门负责灌溉工作；并吸收附近的单干农民组成临时的集体浇地小组，以便节省人力和水量。有的村庄还召开了灌户会议，讨论分水、合理灌溉和互相帮助等问题，并订出爱水浇地公约。　（新华社）
