　　Dunhuang—An Excellent Cotton-Producing Area
　　Chen Jun
    Everyone in the world knows Dunhuang. There is the Mogao Caves there, which preserves the excellent ancient cultural heritage and rich historical materials of the Chinese people. However, few people know that it is an excellent cotton-producing area.

    Dunhuang is suitable for growing cotton, but in the past no one cared about it or developed it, so cotton production has always been very low. More than a decade ago, Li Youfu, a farmer from the Third Township of the Third District (Tao Minzhou Township) of this county, brought in some new cotton seeds from other areas. In the first year, he tried planting some on the edge of the field, and the yield was much higher than the original cotton seeds. In the second year, he replaced all his cotton fields with this new cotton seed, and as a result, each mu yielded an average of more than 100 jin of ginned cotton. In the third year, his cotton fields also harvested more than 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu, which was more than twice as high as the yield of local cotton seeds. This matter spread, and nearby farmers came to Li Youfu to exchange cotton seeds. In this way, "Tao Minzhou's cotton" became famous. However, during the period of reactionary rule, the reactionaries were concerned with extortion, not growing cotton. Li Youfu's excellent cotton seeds slowly became mixed with the old cotton seeds and degenerated. In the early days of liberation, the interest of farmers in Dunhuang County in growing cotton was very low, the planting area of cotton fields had been shrinking year by year, and the yield had also been decreasing year by year. In 1952, the cotton field area decreased from 23,500 mu in 1950 to 10,200 mu, and the yield per unit area was only 33 jin of ginned cotton. After the completion of land reform in Dunhuang and the launch of the production movement, and with the significant increase in grain, this situation of cotton production shrinking aroused the concern of the Party and the People's Government.

    The frost-free period in the Dunhuang area is between 180 and 200 days, the soil is good, and there is little rainfall, but the snowmelt from the Qilian Mountains provides sufficient irrigation for the cotton fields. The Dunhuang County Committee of the Communist Party of China studied the past cotton planting situation in this area and decided to actively support farmers in planting cotton. In 1953, it began to promote the Soviet Union's excellent cotton seeds in this area with emphasis.

    The Soviet cotton seeds were first tested in the Third and Fourth Townships of the Third District, and the results were much higher than the yield of the old cotton seeds. The cotton yield per unit area of farmer Qiu Xuqi reached an average of 90 jin of ginned cotton, and the highest was 120 jin. Facts are the most powerful propaganda. When farmers saw that the Soviet cotton seeds were good, everyone asked to switch to the Soviet cotton seeds. In 1954, two-thirds of the county's cotton fields were replaced with Soviet cotton seeds, the cotton field area was restored to more than 17,000 mu, and the yield per unit area was also increased to 66 jin of ginned cotton. In this year, the state purchased more than 600,000 jin of cotton in Dunhuang. The Yangjiaqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yixiang, Sanqu, Dunhuang grew 100 mu of cotton. Due to the improvement of cultivation techniques, the average yield per mu reached 100 jin of ginned cotton. These facts further proved that Dunhuang has a bright future for developing cotton production.

    In 1955, the Dunhuang County People's Committee decided to plant 50,000 mu of cotton in the county's 180,000 mu of cultivated land, and the planned yield per unit area was to be increased to 75 jin of ginned cotton. In order to ensure the realization of this plan, the Dunhuang County Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted in-depth publicity and mobilization and organizational work among the farmers.

    All of a sudden, the demand to expand cotton fields to 50,000 mu caused farmers to have many concerns: they were afraid that late frost would destroy the cotton seedlings, resulting in a loss of both cotton and grain; they were afraid that the wheat fields would be reduced, and the government would supply too much miscellaneous grain; they were afraid that the cotton fields would occupy the autumn fields, and there would not be enough fodder for the livestock; especially the women had the greatest ideological resistance, because picking cotton relied entirely on women, and they were afraid that they would be too busy and too tired.

    In response to these concerns, the Party explained to the farmers the important significance of planting cotton for supporting national industrial construction and solving the raw material problem of the cotton textile industry, and publicized the government's regulations on the cotton-grain price ratio, cotton pre-purchase, burdens, and supply policies. Meetings of all sizes were held for women in various townships, and repeated education was carried out. Through the leading role of women activists, they were guaranteed to take on the task of picking cotton. Women in the city also proposed a plan to help farmers in the four townships pick cotton.

    The Dunhuang County People's Committee has taken some specific measures to ensure the completion of the plan to expand cotton fields.

    In order to solve the problem of insufficient fodder for livestock, the North Lake area was selected to build dams and divert water to irrigate 11,000 mu of grassland, and it is estimated that 3 million jin of grass can be harvested this year.

    In order to prevent late frost, the agricultural technology department taught farmers how to prevent frost.

    In order to ensure the improvement of cotton yield, the County People's Committee also trained 180 cotton planting technicians. Through them, another 1,800 farmers were trained. At the same time, before sowing, the Dunhuang County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the County People's Committee convened a county-wide meeting of district and township cadres, and invited people from the Jiuquan Special District Technical Guidance Station to explain seed selection, seed mixing, seed soaking, the ditch irrigation method used during sowing, and promote new cotton seeders to ensure appropriate row spacing during sowing. The County People's Committee plans to hold another collective training for district and township cadres after the cotton seedlings emerge, to teach the basic knowledge of thinning, fixing seedlings, pruning, and pest prevention, so that district and township cadres can strengthen the specific leadership of cotton planting.

    In the work of expanding cotton fields, the county's twenty-eight agricultural production cooperatives played a leading role. In seed selection, the Yangjiaqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative implemented grain selection, and also invited representatives of mutual aid groups and some individual farmers from the entire township to visit, promoting seed selection work in the entire township.

    The vast majority of the existing cultivated land in Dunhuang County is suitable for planting cotton. According to the county party secretary, as long as cultivation techniques are carefully improved, it is possible to increase the yield per unit area to 120 to 130 jin of ginned cotton. Dunhuang also has large areas of wasteland. As long as water conservancy is built, and 60% to 70% of the lost water is stored in reservoirs for planned irrigation, Dunhuang can also reclaim large areas of cotton fields.

    Dunhuang is an excellent cotton-producing area with a promising future. The key to developing the cotton planting industry lies in strengthening technical guidance, building water conservancy projects, and carrying out planned immigration to solve the labor problem required for reclamation.

　　敦煌—优良的产棉区
　　陈浚
    敦煌，全世界都知道它，那里有个千佛洞，保存了中国人民优秀的古代文化遗产和丰富的历史资料。然而，还很少人知道它是一个优良的产棉区。
    敦煌宜于种棉，但是过去没有人去关心它，发展它，所以棉花产量一直很低。十几年前，这个县第三区第三乡（洮泯州乡）的农民李有福，曾从别的地区找来一些新的棉种。第一年，他在地边上试种了一些，产量比原来的棉种高得多。第二年，他就在自己的棉田上，全部换种了这种新棉种，结果每亩地平均产皮棉一百多斤。第三年，他的棉田每亩地也收了皮棉八十多斤，比本地棉种的产量高出两倍以上。这件事传播开了，附近农民纷纷来找李有福换棉籽。这样，“洮泯州的棉花”就出了名。可是，在反动统治时期，反动派关心的是敲诈勒索，不是种棉花，李有福的优良棉种，慢慢地就同旧棉种混杂了，退化了。解放初期，敦煌县农民种棉的兴趣很低，棉田的播种面积已逐年缩小，产量也逐年降低。一九五二年棉田面积由一九五○年的二万三千五百亩，缩小到了一万零二百亩，单位面积产量只有皮棉三十三斤。在敦煌完成了土地改革，开展了生产运动，粮食有了显著的增加以后，这种棉花生产萎缩的情况就引起了党和人民政府的关怀。
    敦煌地区的无霜期在一百八十天到二百天之间，土质好，雨量少，但祁连山下来的雪水泉水足供棉田的灌溉。中共敦煌县委会研究了这个地区过去的植棉情况，就决定要积极扶植农民植棉；一九五三年开始在这个地区有重点地推广了苏联的优良棉种。
    苏联棉种先在三区第三乡和第四乡试种，结果都比旧棉种的产量高得多。农民丘旭岐的棉花单位面积产量平均达到了九十斤皮棉，最高的有一百二十斤。事实是最有力的宣传，农民看见苏联棉种好，大家就都要求换种苏联棉种。一九五四年，全县三分之二的棉田都换种了苏联棉种，棉田面积恢复到了一万七千多亩，单位面积产量也提高到了皮棉六十六斤。这一年，国家在敦煌收购了六十万斤以上的棉花。敦煌三区一乡杨家桥农业生产合作社种了一百亩棉花，由于改进了耕作技术，每亩平均产量达到了皮棉一百斤。这些事实，进一步证明了敦煌有发展棉花生产的光明前景。
    一九五五年，敦煌县人民委员会决定在全县十八万亩耕地中，要种棉花五万亩，单位面积产量计划要提高到七十五斤皮棉。中共敦煌县委为了保证实现这个计划，在农民中间进行了深入的宣传动员和组织工作。
    一下子要求把棉田扩大到五万亩，农民发生了多方面的顾虑：怕晚霜毁了棉苗，棉粮两空；怕缩小了麦田，政府供应的杂粮过多；怕棉田占了秋田，牲口草料不足；尤其是妇女的思想抵触最大，因为拣棉花全部靠妇女，她们怕忙不过来，怕太劳累。
    针对这些顾虑，党向农民说明了植棉对于支援国家工业建设、解决棉纺织工业原料问题的重要意义，宣传了政府规定的棉粮比价、棉花预购、负担和供应等政策。对于妇女分乡召开了大会小会，反复进行了教育，通过妇女积极分子带头，保证担任起拣棉的任务。城里的妇女也向四乡农民提出了帮助拣棉花的计划。
    敦煌县人民委员会采取了一些具体措施，来保证扩大棉田计划的完成。
    为了解决牲畜草料不足的问题，选定了北湖地区，打坝引水，浇了一万一千亩草地，预计今年可以收割三百万斤草。
    为了预防晚霜，农业技术部门在农民中间传授了防霜办法。
    为了保证提高棉花的产量，县人民委员会还训练了一百八十个植棉技术员。通过他们，又传授了一千八百个农民。同时，中共敦煌县委和县人民委员会在播种以前，召开了全县区乡干部会议，请酒泉专区技术指导站派人讲解了选种、拌种、浸种，播种时采用的沟灌法，推广新的棉耧，保证播种行距的适当。县人民委员会准备到棉苗出来以后，再集训区乡干部，传授间苗、定苗、整枝的基本知识和防虫办法，使区乡干部能够加强对植棉的具体领导。
    在扩大棉田的工作中，全县的二十八个农业生产合作社起了带头作用。在选种中，杨家桥农业生产合作社实行了粒选，还邀请了全乡的互助组的代表和部分个体农民来参观，推动全乡的选种工作。
    敦煌县现有的耕地绝大部分是适宜于植棉的。据县委书记谈，只要认真改进耕作技术，单位面积产量提高到皮棉一百二、三十斤，是有可能的。敦煌还有大片的荒地，只要兴修了水利，把流失的百分之六十到七十的水量储到水库去，进行有计划的灌溉，敦煌还可以开垦出大片棉田。
    敦煌是一个有发展前途的优良的产棉区，发展植棉业的关键，在于加强技术指导、兴修水利和有计划地进行移民，解决垦植所需要的劳力问题。
