Title: Hospitals are not places to “store” cadres

To the Editor:

    There is a very bad phenomenon that should be brought to the attention of all units. Currently, some agencies are allowing sick cadres to stay in hospitals and sanatoriums indefinitely, and they are not discharged even after they recover. According to statistics, the Beijing Medical College Affiliated Hospital has an average of about 8% of patients who could be discharged but are not, and the figures for hospitals directly under central government agencies are even higher. The cadre sanatorium directly under the Ministry of Health currently has 26% of patients who should have been discharged long ago but have not been; many have been hospitalized for more than two years, and some have even been hospitalized for four or five years.

    “Storing” cadres in hospitals has caused very bad consequences: it not only wastes manpower, preventing cadres from fully utilizing their energy, weakening their work enthusiasm and sense of responsibility, but also affects the turnover rate of hospital beds, causing chaos in hospitals. I hope that relevant units will pay attention to preventing this kind of artificial waste.

### 医院不是“存放”干部的地方

　　医院不是“存放”干部的地方编辑同志：
    有一种很不好的现象值得提出来引起各单位的注意。现在，有些机关让患病的干部无限期地住在医院和疗养院里，病好了也不接他们出院。据统计，北京医学院附属医院可以出院而不出院的病人平均经常有百分之八左右，中央直属机关各医院的数字更高。卫生部直属干部疗养院现在有百分之二十六的病人早就应该出院而没有出院，很多人住院在二年以上，有的甚至住院在四、五年以上的。
    把干部“存放”在医院里造成了很不好的后果：这不仅浪费了人力，使干部的精力不能充分发挥，削弱了这些干部的工作积极性和责任心。而且影响了医院的病床周转率，造成医院的忙乱现象。我希望有关单位注意防止这种人为的浪费现象。
