Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 4th: Vietnam News Agency reported on May 3rd: General Van Tien Dung, Chief Representative of the Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army to the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Commission, wrote a letter to the International Commission on April 27th, protesting the French side's continued coercion of people in the Haiphong area to migrate south.

The letter cited specific facts of the French side abducting residents, such as stamping identification cards of those who came to collect "relief" grain with words indicating their desire to go to the south; later, during ID checks, forcing all those with such markings on their cards to migrate. They also arrested residents by the hundreds in many areas, forcing them to migrate south.

The Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army requested in the letter that the International Commission pay special attention to the aforementioned acts of forced migration, dispatch mobile inspection teams to inspect the departure of all ships carrying civilians migrating south; and requested the International Commission dispatch a mobile inspection team to Haiphong to investigate certain instances of forced migration cited by the Vietnamese side.

　　越方代表写信给国际委员会
　　抗议法方继续强迫海防地区人民南迁
    新华社河内四日电　据越南通讯社三日讯：越南中央联合停战委员会越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇将军在四月二十七日写给国际委员会一封信，抗议法方继续强迫海防地区人民南迁。
    信中列举法方劫运居民的具体事实，例如在前来领取“救济”粮食的那些人的身份证上盖上了他们希望到南部去的字样；以后在查验身份证时强迫所有身份证上有这样字样的人迁移。又如他们还在很多地区成百地逮捕居民，强迫他们南迁。
    越南人民军总司令部代表团在信中要求国际委员会特别注意上述的强迫迁移行为，派遣机动视察小组，检查载运南迁平民的一切船只的离开；并且要求国际委员会派遣一个机动视察小组前往海防，调查越方列举的某些强迫迁移事例。
