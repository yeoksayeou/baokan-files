　　A Successful Labor Transfer

    For the needs of the drilling projects of the Jiawang and Huainan Mining Bureaus in East China, the First Basic Construction Bureau of Northeast Coal Mines decided to transfer the Fuxin and Fushun geological exploration teams to provide support. After two months of work, this task was successfully completed in early March, with five drilling rigs and a group of employees and their families transferred to the Jiawang and Huainan coal mines, ensuring that the projects started on schedule. This labor transfer was successful. During this transfer, the First Basic Construction Bureau of Northeast Coal Mines carried out a series of tasks.
    At the beginning, some workers were afraid that their wages would be affected after the transfer, and some were afraid that no one would take care of their families. Therefore, some workers were even unwilling to do drilling work and planned to change careers. Most family members expressed dissatisfaction with the dispersed and mobile life of drilling workers, and the idea of ​​"reluctance to leave their homeland" was very common, which caused difficulties in the transfer work. Starting in January of this year, the Party committees and administrative leaders of the Fuxin and Fushun drilling teams first paid attention to ideological work and carried out ideological mobilization among the proposed transferees and their families in a planned and prepared manner. Work teams composed of Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League members went deep into the field to conduct patient ideological education, focusing on the importance of subordinating individual interests to overall interests. They particularly emphasized that personnel and machinery must be transferred with quality and quantity to ensure that the receiving units started on schedule. A general meeting of all employees was also held to introduce the situation in various aspects of East China in detail and explain the ideological problems existing among the employees. The Fushun Exploration Team also established temporary Party and Communist Youth League branches among the transferred personnel. The Fuxin Party General Branch called on Party and Communist Youth League members to take the lead, and Party and Communist Youth League members voluntarily wrote guarantees. Therefore, a upsurge of responding to the call was launched among the employees, which basically reversed various incorrect ideas and strengthened their determination to go to East China.
    In order to strengthen the work of family members and stabilize the emotions of employees and their families, the administration and the Party committee selected cadres to form family visiting groups, which adopted methods such as group discussions and individual visits to understand the difficulties of family members and help them solve them. For example, all requests to send family members back to their hometowns were approved and wages were paid as usual. For pregnant women, new mothers, and elderly family members, family mutual aid groups were organized to provide care. The trade union gave appropriate financial assistance to families with real difficulties at its discretion. Before departure, "farewell meetings" were held with farmers for those whose families lived in the countryside; get-togethers were held for employees who were not transferred and those who were transferred to express their determination to each other; employees whose family members had difficulties and were properly settled were asked to make introductions at the meeting. These tasks played a great role in settling family members and stabilizing the emotions of employees, making employees deeply appreciate the care of the leadership.
    The transferred employees were organized before departure, and the masses discussed and formulated the discipline and precautions during the journey, and designated special personnel to be responsible for sending them to their destinations to avoid confusion. The more than 160 employees transferred from the Fushun Exploration Team always showed organization, discipline, unified action, and arrived at their destination happily. The Jiawang and Huainan Mining Bureaus also made full preparations for the accommodation, food and material supply of employees and their families in advance, and contacted the township government in advance, sending special personnel to be responsible for renting and repairing houses, preparing utensils, and setting up small clinics, ensuring that employees and their families could immediately rest, eat, and receive medical treatment after arrival. These tasks also played a great role in encouraging the morale of exploration workers.
    After the transferred employees arrived at their destination, the leadership quickly determined the work of the newly arrived cadres, clarified the leadership relationship, established Party and Communist Youth League branches, and established a political leadership core. Among the new family members, a family committee was formed. At the same time, time was seized to prepare for the start of work, preventing relaxation and ensuring on-time commencement.
    During this transfer, the local Party committees did a lot of work. The Fuxin and Xuzhou Municipal Party Committees, and the Jiawang Mine Party Committee all sent people to go deep into the site to guide the work, visit employees, and solve many difficulties, which greatly moved all employees. At the same time, thanks to the strong leadership of the Party Committee, the farmer brothers also gave great care and support to the employees, which played a great role in completing the task.
    This work also proves that in order to make drilling workers who are scattered in remote mountains and fields for a long time obey the transfer and work in peace, it is necessary to strengthen the political work of them and their families, improve their awareness and organization and discipline, and solve their reasonable demands in a timely and appropriate manner. Political work in the transfer must closely cooperate with labor wages, personnel, material supply and other units, fully mobilize, and do a good job in the preparation and organization of human and material resources, so as to reduce non-production time and achieve early start of work.
    In the labor transfer work, it is especially necessary to strengthen the education on the unity of cadres and workers and the worker-peasant alliance. This experience proves that the unity of cadres and cadres, the unity of workers and workers, and the unity of employees' families and local farmers are the main link to overcome chaos and ensure timely start of work.

　　一次胜利的劳动调配
　　西蒙
    为了华东贾汪和淮南矿务局钻探工程的需要，东北煤矿第一基本建设局决定抽调阜新、抚顺两个地质勘探队前往支援。经过两个月的工作，已于三月初胜利地完成了这项任务，将五台钻机和一批职工、家属分别调到了贾汪和淮南煤矿，保证了工程如期开工。这一次劳动调配工作是有成绩的。在这次调动中，东北煤矿第一基本建设局作了一系列的工作。
    开始时，在工人中有的怕调动后工资受影响，有的怕调动后无人照顾家庭，因此个别工人甚至不愿做钻探工作，打算转业。大部分家属则对钻探工人分散、流动的生活表示不满，“故土难离”的思想甚为普遍，造成了调配工作的困难。今年一月份起，阜新、抚顺两钻探队的党委和行政领导上首先重视了思想工作，有计划、有准备地在拟调人员及其家属中进行思想动员，由党、行政、工会、青年团组成工作组，深入现场进行耐心的思想教育，着重说明个人利益服从整体利益的重要性，特别强调人员、机械必须按质按量调出去，保证调入单位按期开工。并召开全体职工大会，详细介绍华东各方面的情况，解释职工思想上存在的问题。抚顺勘探队并在调出人员中建立了党、团临时支部；阜新党总支号召党、团员带头，党、团员自动的写了保证书，因此在职工中掀起了响应号召的热潮，基本上扭转了各种不正确的思想，坚定了去华东的决心。
    为了加强家属工作，安定职工和家属情绪，行政和党委抽调干部组成家庭访问组，采取分组座谈及个别访问等方式，了解家属的困难，帮助他们解决。例如：凡要求送家属回老家的，都予批准并照发工资；对孕妇、产妇及老年家属，则组织家属互助组给予照顾；家庭确有困难的，工会酌情在经济上给予适当补助。在动身前，凡家住在农村的，与农民举行“告别会”；召开不调和被调职工的联欢会互相表示决心；因家属有困难而得到妥善安置的职工，则由他们在大会上作介绍。这些工作对安置家属、稳定职工情绪都起了很大作用，使职工深切体会到领导上对他们的关怀。
    被调职工在启程前就组织起来，由群众讨论订出旅途中纪律及注意事项，并指定专人负责送至目的地，以免混乱。抚顺勘探队被调的一百六十多名职工，在途中始终表现得有组织、有纪律、行动统
  一，情绪愉快地到达了目的地。贾汪和淮南矿务局对职工及家属的住宿、饮食和物资供应，也事先作了充分的准备，并事先和乡政府取得联系，派专人负责租借和修理房屋，准备用具，设立小型医务所，保证了职工和家属到达后能立即休息、吃饭，及有病者就医。这些工作对鼓励勘探职工情绪也起了很大作用。
    被调职工到达了目的地，领导上迅速地确定了新到干部的工作，明确了领导关系，建立了党、团支部，树立政治领导核心。在新来家属中，组成了家属委员会，同时抓紧时间，作好开工准备。及时防止了松劲情绪和保证了按时开工。
    在这次调配工作中，各地党委作了很多工作。阜新、徐州市委、贾汪矿党委都派人深入现场，指导工作，访问职工，解决很多困难，使全体职工大为感动。同时由于党委的有力领导，农民兄弟对职工亦给予了极大的关怀和支持，对完成任务起了很大作用。
    这次工作也证明，要想使长期分散在荒山僻野的钻探工人服从调配，安心生产，必须加强对他们及其家属的政治工作，提高他们的觉悟程度和组织性、纪律性，并及时而适当地解决他们的合理要求。调配中的政治工作必须和劳动工资、人事、材料供应等单位密切配合，全面动员，作好人力、物力的准备和组织工作，这样才能减少非生产时间，做到提前开工。
    在劳动调配工作中，特别要加强关于干部、工人的团结和工农联盟的教育，这次经验证明：干部和干部的团结、工人和工人的团结，职工家属和住地农民的团结是克服混乱、保证及时开工的主要一环。
