    To a Friend Far Away
    Alexander Utkin

My comrade, many obstacles once stood in your path of progress, but in order to advance together with our motherland, Mao Zedong did everything that needed to be done. I have not been to Beijing, nor have I been to Shanghai, but I have long known and am convinced that in that distant place there is another country where all the people are my friends. Now, I live with you and know that our lives are full of light; like you, I labor for my country, and we will work together to build communism. Mao Zedong, like Lenin and Stalin, is guiding the great people of great China. The distant place shines on us like the sun, and we are advancing towards a bright future. China is growing not day by day, but moment by moment, and the large-scale construction is becoming more and more magnificent. China is not alone, many countries are its friends, and powerful Moscow is its confidante. My comrade, please accept the greetings from a Russian friend thousands of kilometers away. We are walking the same path, and our slogan is: Fight for peace! Striving for world peace—like an unchangeable law—this is the call of all nations. They are bringing freedom and happiness to the world, my Moscow and your Beijing!

　　充满热情的友谊和诗篇敬爱的编辑同志：
    请把我写的这几行平凡的、但是充满感情的诗，发表在你们的报纸上，作为我献给正在建设幸福愉快的生活的中国人民的友谊的敬礼。让它不仅表达我个人的心情，也表达全体苏联人民的心情。
    敬礼！亚历山大·乌特金
                        斯维德洛夫斯克
                      一九五五年五月六日
　　给远方的朋友
    亚历山大·乌特金我的同志，在你前进的大道上曾经横亘着障碍重重，但为了同我们祖国一起前进，毛泽东做了一切要做的事情。我没有到过北京，也没有到过上海，但我早已知道，并且确信，在那遥远的地方有另一个国家，那里全国人民都是我的友人。现在，我同你一起生活，并且知道我们的生活充满了光明；我同你一样为自己的祖国而劳动，我们要同心协力把共产主义建成。毛泽东，正像列宁和斯大林，引导着伟大中国的伟大人民。远方像太阳一样照耀着我们，我们向着光辉的远景前进。中国不是一天天、而是时时刻刻在生长，大规模的建设越来越宏伟壮丽，中国不是孤独的，许多国家是他的朋友，强大的莫斯科是他的知己。我的同志，请接受来自数千公里以外的
  一个俄罗斯朋友的敬礼。我们走的路完全相同，我们的口号是：为和平而斗争！争取世界和平——像一条不改变的法律——这是各国人民的呼声。它们正在给世界带来自由和幸福，我的莫斯科和你的北京！
