    Eradicating Bourgeois Viewpoints in Fiscal Research
    Wang Genjian
    Fiscal science is a social science with distinct Party character. Its Party character is distinct because the nature of finance cannot be separated from the nature of the state, and the state is a machine for class rule and a tool for class struggle. Therefore, fiscal science is naturally no exception to carrying out ideological struggle in the field of academic research.
    In the past few years, bourgeois viewpoints have been quite widespread in several specialized books on fiscal theory published in our country and in articles discussing fiscal issues scattered in various publications.
    Bourgeois viewpoints in the field of fiscal science are first manifested in research methods.
    We know that the research method universally adopted in bourgeois fiscal theories is the so-called "four-part method." According to this method, they divide fiscal science into four parts for research: "Public Expenditure Theory," "Public Revenue Theory," "Revenue and Expenditure Balance Theory," and "Financial Administration Theory." This "four-part method" completely conceals the class nature and historical nature of finance. Because, from this "four-part method," people will not see the essential difference between different types of state finance that are controlled by different classes and serve different classes. They will not see the qualitative changes in finance caused by the development of socio-economic factors and changes in state types. Since they are called "public" revenue and "public" expenditure, it seems as if the fiscal revenue and expenditure of various countries are truly, as bourgeois scholars say, "to meet the collective needs of all members of society," and the bourgeois state is regarded as a supra-class organization. This will confuse the broad masses of oppressed laborers in bourgeois countries, make them support the existing reactionary regime, and withdraw from the fervent revolutionary struggle; in this way, it may also cause the laboring masses who have seized power to lose their direction in managing their own state finance and abandon the principle of class differentiation. This "four-part method" starts from the premise that fiscal phenomena and fiscal essence are eternally unchanging. Therefore, they only see the formal, superficial similarities of fiscal categories (such as taxation, budgets, etc.), without seeing the different essence and types of fiscal categories at different stages of social development. This "four-part method" also starts from the premise that all government bonds issued by all countries are tools to seek "revenue and expenditure balance," that is, budget balance. All countries' budgets, like bourgeois state budgets, are inextricably linked to deficits. Therefore, the issue of national debt in all countries is studied in the "revenue and expenditure balance theory." Obviously, this "four-part method" fully reflects the bourgeois "supra-class" and anti-historical viewpoints.
    However, everyone sees that many fiscal science books published in our country have essentially adopted this research method.
    In order to criticize the bourgeois research method, it must be replaced by the Marxist dialectical method. The Marxist dialectical method believes that the objectively existing fiscal phenomenon always belongs to a specific socio-economic structure and the type of state arising therefrom, and that the socio-economic structure and the state are constantly in the process of development and change. Therefore, finance is a historical category. Since finance has historicity, we cannot stay in the general concept of finance, but should specifically analyze the characteristics of a certain type of state finance, discover the essential difference between this state finance and that state finance. We should study fiscal science in the order of social development, according to the difference in state types, and divide fiscal science into pre-capitalist state finance, bourgeois state finance, Soviet and people's democratic state finance, and other parts for research.
    At present, a view is still popular among many fiscal scholars in our country, which is to call the finance of our country in the transition period and the finance of other people's democratic countries a "mixed type" of finance. For example, Wu Dango said in his book "On State Finance" (published by Lixin Accounting Books and Supplies Co.): "In a New Democratic society, no new mode of production has been created... Therefore, a completely new 'fiscal method' cannot be produced in a New Democratic society. The finance of the New Democratic state is a mixed type. In the fiscal system of the New Democratic state, on the one hand, many new socialist types of fiscal forms have emerged, and on the other hand, many old capitalist types of fiscal forms and fiscal forms suitable for small commodity economy have been retained." "Moreover, it is not only in the tax system that the mixed type is manifested, but also in the content of fiscal revenue and expenditure and in the issuance of government bonds... The mixed type of state finance is the first characteristic of New Democratic finance." (Pages 66-67)
    Yin Wenjing completely repeated or simply copied Wu Dango's argument in his "National Finance" (published by Lixin Accounting Books and Supplies Co.). He said: "...Due to the diversity of economic components in the New Democracy, a mixed type of fiscal form is bound to be formed, that is, on the one hand, corresponding to the development of the socialist economy, some new socialist types of fiscal forms have emerged; on the other hand, old capitalist types and fiscal forms suitable for small commodity economy are retained to varying degrees." (Page 350)
    In addition, Ding Fang and Luo Yi in their "New Fiscal Science Tutorial" (published by October Publishing House), and Su Jicang in his "New Fiscal Science Tutorial" (published by Xinchao Bookstore), hold the same view as Wu Dango. It is completely wrong to regard the finance of our country in the transition period and the finance of other people's democratic countries as a "mixed type" of finance. The reason for the mistake is that they not only do not understand that the fiscal revenue of our country is mainly derived from socialist economic components, but also completely ignore the fundamental question of who the state finance serves. In fact, what determines which type of finance it belongs to is its class essence and the object it serves. As is well known, the finance of our country in the transition period aims at developing the socialist economy and socialist culture, consolidating the people's democratic state, and continuously improving the material and cultural living standards of the laboring masses. It serves the realization of the state's general tasks and the construction of socialism. Therefore, like the finance of the Soviet Union during the transition period and the finance of other people's democratic countries at present, it belongs to the socialist type of finance, not a "mixed type" of finance.
    The above-mentioned authors do not understand the class essence of the finance of our country in the transition period and its service objects. Therefore, they also obliterate the essential difference between the finance of our country and the finance of all exploiting class countries, thereby obliterating the superiority of the finance of our country. For example, Ding Fang and Luo Yi said in their "New Fiscal Science Tutorial": "Similarly, the New Democratic finance also inherited many unreasonable elements from the old finance. Therefore, how to reform and abandon these old elements and transform them into a new type of finance that can undertake the arduous task of developing the economy and ensuring the supply of revolutionary war is the main issue in the construction process of the New Democratic finance... How to move from a deficit, inflation-ridden finance to a finance with balanced revenue and expenditure and stable prices; how to move from a finance that seeks endlessly and exhausts the people and wastes money to a finance that simplifies the tax system and implements reasonable burdens." (Volume 1, pages 68-69) Here, Ding and Luo have not clearly distinguished the boundary between New China and Old China. Under the domination of this view, Ding and Luo also regard the taxes of New China and the taxes under the rule of the Kuomintang as homogeneous. They said: This industrial and commercial tax "includes the business tax and profit-seeking enterprise income tax of the Kuomintang era, as well as special business tax, temporary windfall profit tax, itinerant merchant tax, peddler tax and other tax items... In order to facilitate the increase of taxpayers, these taxes are all included in one tax law." (Volume 2, page 342) It is well known that the tax system of New China has had a fundamentally different nature from the tax system during the reactionary rule since the first day of its establishment. Therefore, it cannot be said that the former was merged from the latter.
    In addition to the above-mentioned bourgeois viewpoints and methods, we can also see other bourgeois arguments in the books and magazines published in the past few years. For example, Ding Fang and Luo Yi said in Section 4 of Chapter 2 of the second part of their "New Fiscal Science Tutorial": "To make reasonable use of state expenditure, it is basically necessary to improve the cultural level of the people... Because it can play a supervisory role in the negative aspect, the people can put forward opinions and suggestions to the government at any time on whether the government's expenditure is appropriate. In the positive aspect, after the people's culture is improved, they can directly participate in the affairs of the country, which can not only reduce the amount of national expenditure, but also increase administrative efficiency." (Volume 1, page 271) Here, Ding and Luo are talking about the people's regime and the exploiting class state regime together. In their view, the key lies in improving the cultural level of the people. In the country where the people hold power, it is also necessary to improve the cultural level of the people before the national expenditure can be reasonable and the people can directly participate in the affairs of the country. In the bourgeois country, as long as the cultural level of the people is improved, it can be guaranteed that the national expenditure is reasonable and the laborers directly participate in the affairs of the country. Isn't this obviously a bourgeois lie to deceive the people?
    To give another example: Zhu Xie said in his article "Turnover Tax in Socialist Countries" (Economic Weekly, Issue 16, 1952): "The Soviet Union's turnover tax... is usually paid by the producer and the tax is added to the price of the goods, so the actual burden is still on the consumer rather than the producer." Here, Zhu Xie also uses a purely bourgeois perspective to look at socialist things, thinking that the taxes levied on turnover in capitalist countries must be passed on to consumers, and so is the turnover tax in socialist countries. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union's turnover tax is part of the social net income created by workers in socialist enterprises. This part of the net income is pre-determined by the state in the planned price of the product and is mobilized into the national budget in the form of a turnover tax. This has nothing in common with the method used by private enterprises in bourgeois countries to pass on taxes by raising prices after paying taxes.
    Just giving the above examples is enough to know that bourgeois ideology and viewpoints are still quite widely spread in our country's existing fiscal treatises. This shows the seriousness of the problem! In the transition period, finance is of great significance to socialist construction. Lenin once said: "Do not forget that if we do not achieve success in fiscal policy, all our thorough reforms will be doomed to failure. The victory of our great cause of transforming society by socialist methods depends on the victory of fiscal policy." ("Speech at the All-Russian Congress of Representatives of Financial Departments of Soviets," "Lenin's Collected Works" Volume 6, page 94) However, to do a good job in financial work, there must be a correct guiding ideology. If we allow bourgeois ideological bacteria to spread freely in the field of fiscal science, it will cause many of our practical workers to lose their direction. Therefore, it is an unavoidable task to use the viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism to criticize the bourgeois viewpoints in the field of fiscal science and to expound the essence and tasks of finance under our social system.

    清除财政学研究中的资产阶级观点
    王亘坚
    财政学是一门具有鲜明党性的社会科学，它的党性之所以鲜明，就是因为财政的性质不能离开国家的性质，而国家又是阶级统治的机器和阶级斗争的工具。因此，在学术研究领域内开展思想斗争，财政学自然不能例外。
    近几年来，在我国出版的几本研究财政理论的专门书籍和散见于各种刊物上的讨论财政问题的文章中，资产阶级观点仍相当广泛地存在着。
    财政学领域中的资产阶级观点，首先表现在研究方法上面。
    我们知道，在资产阶级财政学说中，普遍地采用的研究方法，是所谓“四分法”。按照这种方法，他们把财政学这门学科分作四个部分来研究：“公共支出论”、“公共收入论”、“收支适合论”、“财务行政论”。这种“四分法”完全掩盖了财政的阶级性和历史性，因为，人们从这个“四分法”中，将看不出被不同阶级所掌握、为不同阶级服务的不同类型国家财政的本质差别，将看不出随着社会经济的发展、国家类型的变化而引起的财政的质的变化。既然叫“公共”收入和“公共”支出，那就好像是各个国家的财政收支都真如资产阶级学者所说的那样，是“为了满足社会所有成员的集体需要”，并把资产阶级的国家看成了超阶级的组织。这样就会迷惑资产阶级国家里广大被压迫的劳动群众，使他们拥护现存的反动政权，而从火热的革命斗争中退出来；这样，也就可能使掌握了政权的劳动群众，在管理自己的国家财政中，迷失了斗争的方向，放弃了按照阶级区别对待的原则。这种“四分法”是从财政现象和财政实质永恒不变的前提出发的，因而他们只看到财政范畴（如税收、预算等）的形式、外表上的相同，都没有看到财政范畴在社会发展的不同阶段上有不同的实质和类型。这种“四分法”还是从这样的前提出发：那就是所有国家发行的公债都是谋求“收支适合”即预算收支平衡的工具，所有国家的预算，都像资产阶级国家预算一样，和赤字结成了不解之缘，因而就把各国公债的问题都放在“收支适合论”里来研究。显然，这种“四分法”是充分反映资产阶级的“超阶级”的和反历史的观点的。
    但是，大家看到，我国出版的许多财政学书籍，实质上都采用了这种研究方法。
    为要批判资产阶级的研究方法，必须代之以马克思主义的辩证方法。马克思主义的辩证方法认为，客观存在着的财政现象从来都是属于特定的社会经济结构以及由此而产生的国家类型的，而社会经济结构和国家又是经常处于发展和变化的过程中的，因此，财政是一种历史的范畴。财政既然具有历史性，那么，我们就不能停留在财政的一般概念中，而是应该具体地分析某一特定类型国家财政的特质，发现这一国家财政和那一国家财政的本质区别；应该按照社会发展的顺序、按照国家类型的差别来研究财政科学，把财政学分为资本主义以前的国家财政，资产阶级国家财政，苏联和人民民主国家财政等部分来研究。
    目前，在我国不少财政学者中间，还流行着这样一种观点，就是把过渡时期的我国财政以及其他人民民主国家的财政叫做“混合型”的财政。例如，伍丹戈在其所著“论国家财政”（立信会计图书用品社出版）一书中说：“在新民主主义社会，并没有创造新的生产方式……因此在新民主主义社会也不可能产生一种完全新的‘财政方式’，新民主主义国家财政是混合型的；在新民主主义国家的财政体系中，一方面虽然产生了许多新的社会主义类型的财政形态，一方面也保留了许多旧的资本主义类型的财政形态，以及适合于小商品经济的财政形态。”“而且，不但在税捐制度上表现了混合型，就是在财政收支的内容上，在公债的发行上，也都表现了混合性质，……国家财政的混合型，是新民主主义财政的第一个特色。”（六六——六七页）
    尹文敬在其“国家财政学”（立信会计图书用品社出版）一书中，完全重复了或者简直就是抄袭了伍丹戈的这种论点。他说：“……由于新民主主义经济成分的多样性，必然构成混合型的财政形态，即是一方面相应于社会主义经济的发展，产生了若干新的、社会主义类型的财政形态；另方面又或多或少地保留着旧的、资本主义类型的以及适合于小商品经济的财政形态。”（三五○页）
    此外，丁方、罗毅在他们的“新财政学教程”（十月出版社版）中，粟寄沧在其“新财政学教程”（新潮书店版）中，都是和伍丹戈持同样观点的。把过渡时期的我国财政及其他人民民主国家财政看成是“混合型”的财政，是完全错误的。其所以错误，就在于他们不但不了解我国财政收入是以社会主义经济成分作为主要来源，而且完全忽略了国家财政究竟为谁服务这一根本问题。实际上，决定财政之属于那一类型的是它的阶级实质和它服务的对象。如所周知，过渡时期的我国财政是以发展社会主义经济和社会主义文化、为了巩固人民民主国家、为了不断提高劳动群众的物质和文化生活水平为目的的，是为实现国家的总任务，建设社会主义服务的。因此，它和苏联过渡时期的财政、目前其他人民民主国家的财政一样，是属于社会主义类型的财政，不是什么“混合型”的财政。
    上述作者不明了过渡时期我国财政的阶级实质和它的服务对象，因而他们也就抹煞了我国财政和一切剥削阶级国家财政的本质差别，从而抹煞了我国财政的优越性。例如：丁方、罗毅在他们那本“新财政学教程”中说：“同样，新民主主义的财政也从旧财政里承受了许许多多不合理的要素，因此，如何改革、扬弃这些旧的要素，使其脱胎换骨变成能够承担起发展经济、保证革命战争供给的艰巨任务的新式财政，是新民主主义财政建设过程中的主要课题。……如何由赤字、通货膨胀财政走上收支平衡，物价平稳的财政；如何由诛求无已劳民伤财的财政，走上简化税制、实行合理负担的财政。”（上册，六八—六九页）在这里，丁、罗二人对于新中国和旧中国的界限是没有划分清楚的。在这种观点支配之下，丁、罗二人又把新中国的税收和国民党统治下的税收也看成同质的东西。他们说：此项工商业税，“包括有国民党时代的营业税和营利事业所得税，以及特种营业税，一时利得税，行商税，摊贩税等多种税目。……为谋纳税人的增加便利，所以，把这几种税，俱列入一个税法。”（下册，三四二页）人所共知，新中国的税制自建立的第一天起就具有与反动统治时期的税制根本不同的性质，因而，决不能够说前者是由后者合并而成的。
    除了上述资产阶级观点和方法以外，我们在几年来所出版的书籍和杂志中还可以看到资产阶级的其他论调。例如：丁方、罗毅所著的“新财政学教程”第二编第二章第四节中说：“国家支出，要做到合理使用，基本上，需要提高人民的文化水平。……因为它在消极方面，可以发生监督作用，人民对政府开支的是否恰当，随时提出意见建议政府。而在积极方面，人民文化提高后，都能直接参加国家的事务，这样不仅可使国家支出的数量减少，且可使行政效率增加。”（上册，二七一页）在这里，丁、罗二人又是把人民政权和剥削阶级国家政权放在一起谈的，在他们看来，关键在于提高人民的文化水平，在人民掌握政权的国家里，也必须提高了人民的文化水平之后，才能使国家支出合理和使人民直接参加国家的事务；而在资产阶级国家里，只要提高了人民的文化水平，就可以保证国家支出的合理和劳动者直接参加国家的事务。这不明明是资产阶级欺骗人民的鬼话吗？
    再举一个例子：朱偰在其“社会主义国家的周转税”（经济周报一九五二年十六期）一文中说：“苏联的周转税，……普通由出品者缴付，而将税款加入物品价格之内，所以实际上负担者仍为消费者而非出品者。”在这里，朱偰也是用纯粹资产阶级的眼光来看待社会主义的事物的，以为资本主义国家按周转额课征的税捐一定转嫁给消费者，社会主义国家的周转税也是如此。殊不知苏联的周转税乃是社会主义企业中劳动者所创造的社会纯收入的一部分，这部分纯收入是事先被国家规定在产品的计划价格之内，并用周转税的形式动员到国家预算中去。这和资产阶级国家的私人企业在纳税之后用提高价格的方法把税转嫁出去是没有丝毫共同之点的。
    仅仅举出上面的几个实例就可以知道，资产阶级的思想观点在我国现有的财政论著中，还相当广泛地传播着，由此可以看出问题的严重性！在过渡时期，财政对于社会主义建设具有重要的意义。列宁曾说：“不要忘记：如果我们在财政政策上，不能获得成效，则我们的一切彻底的改革，都会遭到失败的命运。我们所拟定的以社会主义方法去改造社会的伟大事业底胜利，正随财政政策底胜利为转移。”（“在全俄各地苏维埃财政部代表大会上的演说”，“列宁文集”第六册，第九四页）但是，要财政工作做得好，就必须有正确的指导思想。如果听任资产阶级思想的细菌在财政学领域自由散播，那就会使我们的许多实际工作者迷失方向。因此，运用马克思列宁主义的观点，来批判财政学领域内的资产阶级观点，来阐明我国社会制度下的财政的实质和任务，是一件不可忽视的工作。
