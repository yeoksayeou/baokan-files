　　Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo's Written Statement

　　Upon arriving on Chinese soil from Indonesia, I would first like to convey the heartfelt congratulations of the Indonesian people to the Chinese people. For hundreds of years, there have been close friendly relations between our two countries. For a long period, these relations, although not completely interrupted, were hampered. However, in recent years, as our two countries became newly independent nations, our friendly relations could be re-established on the new principles of good neighborliness and peaceful coexistence. Therefore, during the Bandung Asian-African Conference, when your Premier Zhou Enlai graciously invited me to make a return visit to our great neighbor, I sincerely accepted.

　　I have been eagerly anticipating this visit, which will allow me to personally understand the New China, about which we have heard so much. I can say to you with certainty that I am very happy to be among you now.

　　I hope to visit many places and meet many of you in the coming days. I also hope to continue the personal contact between your government and mine, which had such a good start during the Asian-African Conference.

　　The Bandung Conference and the subsequent talks with your Premier have laid a solid foundation for our further cooperation. I am confident that this cooperation will make a valuable contribution to our primary common goal: the realization of world peace. The people of Asia need peace and good neighborly relations to develop themselves into prosperous and peaceful nations. Therefore, we must spare no effort to achieve these goals.

　　Finally, I am very grateful to all of you for the warm welcome you gave me upon my arrival in this beautiful city of Guangzhou. I can take this as a good omen for my subsequent stay in your great country.

　　沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理的书面声明
    在从印度尼西亚抵达中国国土的时候，我愿意首先向中国人民转达印度尼西亚人民的衷心祝贺。几百年以来，我们两国之间就存在着密切的友好关系。在很长一段时期内，这些关系虽然没有完全中断，但是受到了阻碍。但是，当在最近几年中我们两国成为新的独立国家的时候，我们的友好关系就可以在睦邻政策和和平共处的新原则上重新建立了。因此，在万隆亚非会议期间，当你们的总理周恩来阁下盛情地邀请我来我们的伟大的邻邦作一次酬答访问的时候，我就诚恳地接受了。
    我一直热切地期待着这次访问，它将使我能够亲自了解我们已经听到谈过很多的新中国，我可以肯定地向你们说，我很高兴现在在你们中间。
    我希望在今后几天中能够访问许多地方并且会晤你们中间的许多人，我同样希望继续在亚非会议期间有这样良好的开端的和你们政府之间的个人接触。
    万隆会议和接着同你们的总理举行的会谈已经为我们的进一步合作奠定了巩固的基础，我确信，这种合作将对我们的首要的共同目的——实现世界和平，作出有价值的贡献。亚洲人民需要和平和睦邻关系来使自己发展成为繁荣的、和平的国家，因此，我们一定要不遗余力地来达到这些目的。
    最后，我非常感谢你们大家在我到达这个美丽的广州城时对我的热烈欢迎，我可以认为这是我在你们的伟大的国家的随后的逗留的一个好的预兆。
