　　Beware of the Deceptive Tactics of Special Agents and Bandits
　　Li Rui
    Anyone with a memory can recall how, during the Anti-Japanese War in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the Party painstakingly opened up and supported revolutionary literary work. Every upright, revolutionary writer placed their hope in the Party and united around it. At that time, everyone weathered the storm together and depended on each other for survival. Yet, how viciously did Hu Feng attack the Party! When I saw the words "Be wary of them, affirm them, shake hands with them with a smile masking contempt" and "Use a rubber-coated wire whip to beat prisoners, causing injuries that are not outwardly visible," I truly felt a chill down my spine. I was reminded of a terrifying incident. I remember in 1940, when I was imprisoned in a Kuomintang jail, as soon as I was locked in solitary confinement, there was a disheveled "prisoner" lying inside. As soon as he saw me, he scrambled up from the ground, shook my hand, and cursed the Kuomintang, saying he was from Yan'an, and was extremely "cordial." Fortunately, I didn't have time to share any "confidential words" with him before another inmate secretly told me while I was relieving myself: "He's a fake prisoner." This incident always sends shivers down my spine whenever I think about it. But today, comparing it with Hu Feng's behavior, he actually relied on the ancestral legacy of special agents and bandits, and lived in the same room with us literary workers for such a long time. This cannot but serve as a lesson for us and arouse our vigilance!

　　警惕特务匪徒的欺骗手段
　　李蕤
    任何一个有记忆的人，都能够记得在抗日期间的国民党统治区，党是如何艰苦卓绝地开辟着支持着革命文艺工作的，每一个正直的革命的作家，都是把希望寄托给党，团结在党的周围的。大家当时是风雨同舟、相依为命。而胡风，他是多么恶毒地向党进攻！当我看到“警戒他们，肯定他们，用微笑包着侮蔑和他们握手言欢”“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”的话时，我真是不寒而栗。我想起一件恐怖的事情。记得一九四○年，当我被关进国民党囚牢的时候，一被关进禁闭室，里面便躺着一个蓬头垢面的“囚犯”，一见面他就从地上一骨碌爬起来，向我握手，大骂国民党，说他是延安来的，可以说非常“亲热”。幸亏我还没有来得及和他说“知心话”，在解手的时候别的难友悄悄告诉我：“他是个假囚犯”。这件事使我每一想起，总有些毛骨悚然。但今天对照一下胡风的行径，他竟靠着特务匪徒的祖传衣钵，和我们文艺工作者在一个屋子里住了这么长的日子，这不能不使我们引为教训，引起警惕！
