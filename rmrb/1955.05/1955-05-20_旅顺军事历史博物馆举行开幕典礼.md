A representative of the Soviet Army Command stationed in the Lushunkou area spoke first, saying that the museum vividly expresses the historical friendship between the people of the two great countries, the Soviet Union and China. Today, we are handing over the museum as a gift to the Chinese people. It will educate visitors in the spirit of the eternal, unbreakable, brotherly friendship between our two great peoples, and inspire visitors to infinitely love their motherland.

Next, a representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Lushunkou area spoke.

He said: It is of great significance that the Soviet army is giving this precious museum to the Chinese people before its withdrawal. The Chinese people will cherish it, take good care of it, and regard it as an important and vivid classroom, from which to learn the revolutionary experience of the Soviet army's heroic struggle, the Soviet army's revolutionary heroism, and the great spirit of internationalism.

Finally, representatives of the Soviet Army Command and the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Lushunkou area cut the ribbon.

The Lushun Military History Museum is divided into eleven exhibition rooms, with exhibits including objects, oil paintings, pictures, models, etc., many of which were transported from the Soviet Union. These exhibits show the growth and strength of the armed forces of China and the Soviet Union; show the victory of the Soviet armed forces and the Soviet people in heroically eliminating the domestic counter-revolutionary armed forces and crushing enemy invasions; show the heroic struggle of the Chinese armed forces and the Chinese people in defeating enemies at home and abroad; and show the great and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

The construction of the museum began in October 1954. The political department of the Soviet Army Command stationed in the Lushunkou area sent leading cadres to be responsible for this work. In order to speed up the interior arrangement of the museum, the Moscow Soviet Army Central Museum and the Vladivostok Pacific Fleet Museum also sent responsible cadres to help in March this year. The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Lushunkou area, and the Lüda Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also sent leading cadres to participate in this work. In addition, painters, officers and soldiers skilled in painting and writing from the Soviet and Chinese troops, as well as sculptors from the Soviet Union and our country, also participated in the construction work.

During the construction of the museum, Chinese and Soviet personnel cooperated closely, helped and learned from each other, and exchanged work experience, which improved the quality of the work.
