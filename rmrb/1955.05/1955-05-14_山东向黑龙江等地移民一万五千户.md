　　Shandong Province is migrating 15,000 households, approximately over 60,000 people, to Heilongjiang, Jilin, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region this spring. They began departing via special trains on April 16th and are scheduled to arrive at their destinations by early May.

　　This migration from Shandong is intended to develop the rich Northeast of the motherland and resolve the production difficulties of farmers in the Yellow River riverbed, flood storage areas, and barren mountainous regions. This migration was proposed at last year's Provincial People's Congress meeting and carried out after approval by the Central Government. To ensure the success of this endeavor, specialized migration agencies have been established at the provincial and county levels, and thorough organizational and mobilization work has been conducted. The migrants' travel expenses are fully covered by the government. Each migration team is also equipped with two or three medical personnel who provide prompt treatment for illnesses. The migrants have expressed their determination to work hard and increase grain production to support the country's industrial construction upon arriving in the Northeast.

　　Thirty-six counties in the eastern, northern, and western parts of Heilongjiang Province are actively preparing to welcome the 10,000 households of migrants from Shandong. The provincial migration work committee has established migrant reception stations at major stations north of Shenyang to provide drinking water and assist with en route matters, to ensure good hospitality along the way. It has also instructed all villages and settlements assigned to receive migrants to be responsible for preparing food and firewood for the migrants' arrival, ensuring that there are mats on the beds, paper on the windows, water in the vats, and pots and stoves for cooking. In terms of production, the migrants should first be settled in agricultural production cooperatives with abundant land, few laborers, and a good foundation; secondly, they should join general cooperatives and mutual aid teams. Except for those who are truly capable of investing, they generally may not invest for the time being. Other farm implements, seeds, and livestock should be taken care of by old cooperative members and team members, and attention should be paid to reasonable division of labor in production to allow migrants to gradually become familiar with local production techniques. To ensure successful migration work, Heilongjiang Province has also sent personnel to Shandong to welcome the migrants. As of May 5th, the first batch of migrants, comprising over 3,600 households and over 16,000 people, has arrived and been dispatched to 17 counties, including Mishan, Baoqing, and Tailai, according to plan.

　　山东向黑龙江等地移民一万五千户
    山东省今春往黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古自治区移民一万五千户约六万多人，已于四月十六日开始分别乘专车启程，计划在五月上旬全部到达目的地。
    山东这次移民，是为了开拓祖国富饶的东北和解决黄河河床上、蓄洪区以及贫瘠山区农民生产的困难。这次移民，是由去年省人民代表大会会议提出、经中央批准后进行的。为了做好这一工作，省、县都设立了专门的移民机构，认真进行了组织动员工作。移民们旅途费用完全由公家负担，每一移民大队并设二、三名医务人员，发现疾病及时治疗。移民们表示到东北后，一定要好好生产，增产粮食，支援国家工业建设。　（本报驻济南记者）
    黑龙江省东部、北部、西部三十六个县份，都在积极迎接来自山东的一万户移民。省的移民工作委员会为做好沿途招待工作，在沈阳以北的主要车站设立移民招待站，供应饮水，协助办理途中事务。并指示凡分配接待移民的村屯都要负责备妥移民到后的粮食、烧柴，做到炕上有席，窗上有纸，缸里有水，做饭有锅灶，生产上，首先应将移民安置在土地多、劳力少、基础好的农业生产合作社里，其次是加入一般社和互助组。除确实有力投资者外，一般可暂不投资。其他农具、籽种、牲畜等均由老社员、老组员给予照顾，并在生产中注意合理分工，使移民逐渐熟悉当地生产技术。为做好移民工作，黑龙江省并派人到山东迎接移民。到五月五日止，第一批移民三千六百多户一万六千多人已经到达，并按计划分赴密山、宝清、泰来等十七县。　（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
