Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: Currently, more than 140,000 kilometers of highways are open to traffic nationwide, nearly double the figure at the end of 1949. Since liberation, nearly 10,000 kilometers of newly built highways have been mostly distributed in the border areas and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in our motherland. The vast majority of highways damaged by the Kuomintang reactionaries have been repaired, with a total repaired mileage of more than 34,000 kilometers. In addition, more than 23,000 kilometers of highways have been rebuilt in recent years.

The transportation tasks undertaken by highways in the national economy are becoming heavier year by year. In 1954, the total transportation volume of highway transportation tools nationwide, including automobiles, carts, horse-drawn carriages, etc., increased more than sevenfold compared with 1950. The planned transportation volume for highways in 1955 is also much higher than in 1954. Currently, tens of thousands of automobiles and carts pass through highways every day to transport materials for basic construction sites or factories and mines in various regions. Grain transportation accounts for about 30 percent of the total highway transportation volume nationwide.

After the opening of the Kangding-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet highways, the ethnic minorities in Xikang, Qinghai, and Tibet have been further connected with the big family of the motherland. In the past, the wool and fur of the herdsmen in those areas were often stockpiled and could not be transported out, and the industrial products they needed were also very difficult to obtain. After the opening of these two highways, the export of animal husbandry products and the import of industrial products and basic construction materials have become much more convenient. In the past, ethnic minority people in remote mountainous areas of Guizhou Province often had no salt to eat. After the construction of some highways, the import volume of edible salt increased, and the price of salt has fallen more than 30 times.

    全国通车的公路已有十四万多公里
    据新华社三日讯　现在全国通车的公路已有十四万多公里，比一九四九年底增加了将近一倍。解放以来，新建的将近一万公里的公路，大部分分布在祖国的边疆和少数民族居住地区；原来被国民党反动派破坏了的公路，绝大部分都已修复，修复公路的里程共有三万四千多公里；另外，几年来改建的公路也有两万三千多公里。
    公路在国民经济中担负的运输任务一年比一年繁重。一九五四年全国公路的运输工具包括汽车、大车、马车等的总运输量，比一九五零年增长了七倍多；一九五五年公路的计划运输量又比一九五四年增长很多。现在，每天有数以万计的汽车、大车通过公路为各地基本建设工地或工厂、矿山运输物资。粮食运输约占全国公路总运量的百分之三十。
    康藏和青藏公路通车后，基本上把西康、青海、西藏一带少数民族和祖国大家庭进一步联系起来了。那些地区牧民们的羊毛、毛皮过去常常积压着运不出来，他们所需要的工业品也很不容易得到。这两条公路通车后，畜牧产品输出和工业品、基本建设器材的输入就方便多了。贵州省偏僻山区的少数民族人民过去常常吃不上盐，修建一些公路后，食盐输入量增加，盐价下降三十多次。
