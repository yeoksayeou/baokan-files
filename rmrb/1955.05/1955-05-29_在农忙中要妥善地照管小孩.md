To the Editor:

　　During the busy farming season, some rural women find it difficult to participate in agricultural production due to the burden of childcare. Many female members of agricultural production cooperatives report: "If we don't participate in production, we don't get paid; if we participate in production, we worry about leaving the children at home." In 1954, in the Democratic Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Chu Shutang Mutual Aid Team in Minzhu Township, Xiaogan County, Hubei, two children drowned in a pond because there were no good arrangements for childcare. Recently, the same situation occurred in Dengjiawan, Minzhu Township. When Xiao Chunfang, a woman from the Xingguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mingxing Township, Xiaogan County, worked in the fields, she tied a rope around her child's waist to prevent him from running around, which is harmful to the child's development and growth.

　　This situation fully illustrates that properly arranging childcare and solving the difficulties faced by women participating in production is very important during the busy farming season. It is hoped that rural work cadres and responsible cadres of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various localities will seize the time to discuss the issue of childcare. Organize elderly people to look after the children in a planned way, so that women participating in production are not distracted, affecting production.

### 在农忙中要妥善地照管小孩

　  在农忙中要妥善地照管小孩编辑同志：
    在农忙的季节里，有些农村妇女因为孩子的牵累，很难参加农业生产。不少农业生产合作社的妇女社员反映：“不参加生产分不到报酬，参加生产小孩丢在家里又不放心。”一九五四年湖北孝感县民主乡民主农业生产合作社及楚树堂互助组，因为对孩子没有很好的安排，有两个小孩掉在水塘内淹死了。最近民主乡邓家湾又发生同样的情况。孝感县明兴乡星光农业生产合作社妇女萧春芳下田时，把小孩腰里捆根绳子拴住，不让他乱跑，这对小孩的发育和成长都是有害的。
    这种情况，充分地说明了在农忙季节，妥善地安置小孩，解决妇女参加生产的困难是很重要的。希望各地农村工作干部和农业生产合作社、互助组的负责干部抓紧时间，讨论一下照管小孩的问题。有计划地组织老年人看管孩子，免得参加生产的妇女心挂两头，影响生产。
