　　Negotiation or Empty Talk Negotiation?
    ——Summary of the "Pravda" Editorial on the 22nd
    "Pravda" published an editorial on the 22nd entitled "Negotiation or Empty Talk Negotiation?"
    The editorial pointed out that the news that the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France had reached a general agreement in Vienna on the purpose and procedure of the four-power government summit has been widely welcomed. The people of all countries have long demanded that the government leaders of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union meet at the round table to consider any outstanding international disputes and make appropriate efforts to resolve them. The desire of the people of all countries for peace is so universal and irresistible that it is impossible to ignore it and dangerous to oppose it. This clearly shows why the American ruling group, which not long ago held a malicious, even hostile, attitude toward the proposal for high-level talks between the major powers, suddenly changed its attitude and announced that they agreed to participate in the talks.
    The editorial said: If it weren't for a few things, one couldn't help but welcome this change in the attitude of the American leaders. These few things make people feel that this decision is not out of concern for strengthening peace and international cooperation, but due to completely different reasons that have nothing in common with the task of easing international tensions.
    The editorial then pointed out that Dulles' and Eisenhower's recent television broadcasts, followed by Eisenhower's press conference, resembled a stage performance glorifying the "policy of strength." They put forward absurd proposals regarding the topics of the major power summit, proposals clearly aimed at undermining the talks, wanting the meeting to consider restoring the old regimes in the people's democracies and declaring communist and progressive movements illegal in capitalist countries. Eight or nine out of ten people who put forward these absurd demands are unable or unwilling to see the fundamental changes that have taken place in the balance of world forces in recent years. They are unable and unwilling to understand that there is absolutely no question of raising the above-mentioned issues in a serious meeting of the heads of the four governments. The fact that leaders of American foreign policy want to use this meeting to interfere in the internal affairs of free and sovereign countries shows that they not only do not understand reality, but have lost their minds. The very fact that the American leaders put forward such items for the meeting cannot but make people think that what they need is not negotiation but empty talk negotiation, so that after they undermine the negotiations, they can condemn the Soviet Union and "prove" that cooperation with the Soviet Union is impossible.
    The editorial further pointed out that Western governments are also attempting to create technical obstacles to the talks. They refuse to hold the meeting in Vienna, which has all the conditions necessary for holding the meeting, and suggest meeting in Lausanne, although everyone knows that it lacks such conditions. They claim that the meeting period must not exceed two or three days, although everyone knows that it is impossible to guarantee a serious consideration of any important international issue in such a short period of time.
    The editorial said: American and British politicians and political leaders have been trying, and are still trying, to use the proposal of a four-power summit, which is popular among the broad masses of the people, to play all kinds of diplomatic tricks, parliamentary conspiracies, and political speculation. For example, just recently, the promise of four-nation negotiations was used to force the parliaments of Western European countries to accelerate the ratification of the Paris Accords. Now, the leaders of the opposition British Labor Party are directly accusing the current British Prime Minister Eden of using the empty talk of a four-power conference only to achieve one goal: to win over voters to the Conservative Party in the parliamentary elections on May 26. American newspapers very bluntly pointed out that the reason why the American government, which had long opposed holding a four-government summit, changed its attitude was to help the British Conservative Party remain in power.
    The editorial concluded: However, the attempt of the advocates of the "policy of strength" to deceive the masses of the people by using the empty talk of convening a major power summit cannot deceive anyone. The people of all countries demand that the leaders of the major powers take concrete steps to ease world tensions, and they eagerly hope to see truly serious and open negotiations, not empty talk negotiations.

　　谈判还是空谈谈判？
    ——“真理报”二十二日的社论摘要
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：
  “真理报”二十二日以“谈判还是空谈谈判？”为题发表社论。
    社论指出，苏联、美国、英国和法国的外交部长们在维也纳开会以后就四国政府首脑会议的目的和程序达成了一般协议，这一消息已经受到广泛的欢迎。世界各国人民早就要求美、英、法、苏的政府领袖们在圆桌上会面，以考虑任何悬而未决的国际争执问题并且作出适当的努力来解决这些问题。各国人民要求和平的愿望是如此普遍和不可抵抗，以致再要对这种愿望置之不理是不可能的，要反对这种愿望是危险的。这明显地说明了：为什么在不久以前对大国最高级会谈的主张抱着恶意的态度、甚至是敌视态度的美国统治集团，会突然改变态度并且宣布他们同意参加这个会谈。
    社论说：假使不是因为有几件事，人们本来不能不欢迎美国领袖这种态度的改变。这几件事使人们觉得，这个决定不是出于对加强和平和国际合作的关心，而是由于一些同缓和国际紧张局势的任务毫无共同之处的完全不同的原因。
    社论接着指出，杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔最近发表的电视广播，艾森豪威尔接着举行的记者招待会，活像歌颂“实力政策”的舞台表演。他们就大国最高级会议的议题提出了目的显然在于破坏会谈的荒谬建议，要会议考虑恢复各人民民主国家的旧政权和宣布资本主义国家中共产主义运动和进步运动为非法的问题。提出这些荒谬要求的人十分之八九是不能够，也不愿意看到世界力量对比近年来发生的根本变化的。他们不能够也不想了解，在四国政府首脑的认真的会议中是根本谈不上提出上述的问题的。美国外交政策方面的领导人想利用这个会议来干涉自由的主权国家的人民的内政，这表明他们不仅不了解现实，而且失去了理智。美国的领袖们为会议提出这样的项目这一事实本身，不能不使人认为他们所需要的不是谈判而是空谈谈判，以便在他们破坏谈判之后可以谴责苏联并且“证明”同苏联合作是不可能的。
    社论又指出，西方国家政府还企图为会谈制造技术障碍。它们拒绝在具备举行会议所必需的一切条件的维也纳举行会议，而建议在洛桑开会，虽然大家知道那里缺乏这样的条件。它们声称会期决不能超过两天或者三天，虽然人人知道在这样短的时间内是不可能保证对任何一个紧要的国际问题进行认真的考虑的。
    社论说：美国和英国的政治家和政界领袖们一直试图，而且现在仍旧在试图利用在广大人民群众中间深受欢迎的四大国最高级会议的主张来耍弄各种各样的外交花招、议会阴谋和政治投机。例如，就在最近，举行四国谈判的诺言就被用来迫使西欧各国议会加速批准巴黎协定。现在在野的英国工党领袖们正在直截了当地指责现任英国首相艾登利用四国会议的空谈只是为了达到这样一个目的：在五月二十六日的议会选举中把选民争取到保守党方面去。美国报纸非常直率地指出，长期反对举行四国政府首脑会议的美国政府所以改变它的态度，是为了帮助英国保守党继续执政。
    社论最后说：但是，“实力政策”的鼓吹者们利用召开大国最高级会议的空谈来欺骗人民群众的企图，是骗不了任何人的。各国人民要求大国政府领袖们采取具体的步骤以缓和世界紧张局势，他们急切地希望看到真正严肃的、开诚布公的谈判，而不是空谈谈判。
