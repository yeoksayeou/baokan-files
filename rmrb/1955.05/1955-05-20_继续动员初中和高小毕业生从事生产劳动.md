Continue to Mobilize Junior Middle School and Senior Primary School Graduates to Engage in Production Labor

In the past two years, significant progress has been made in mobilizing and organizing junior middle school and senior primary school graduates to engage in production labor. Especially in 1954, various localities, based on the policies of the Party and the government, mobilized forces from all aspects and conducted relatively extensive and in-depth propaganda and education work among all social strata, student parents, graduates, and students in school. At the same time, they strengthened guidance on further education and employment for graduating students from primary and secondary schools. As a result, they initially changed the social atmosphere of neglecting graduates' participation in production labor, smoothly resolved the issues of graduates' further education and engagement in production labor, and laid a better foundation for this year's work.

At present and for a considerable period in the future, the basic policy of the state towards junior middle school and senior primary school graduates is, in addition to recruiting a small number of people for further education, mainly to call upon and organize a portion of them to engage in industrial production and the majority to engage in agricultural production and participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. We should make students in primary and secondary schools understand that the purpose of learning is to transform themselves into people with political awareness and cultural cultivation, so as to better engage in production labor. After graduating from primary and secondary schools, they should abide by the state's policies; those who can pursue further education should do so, and those who cannot should consciously and happily engage in production labor or other work, and should not be distressed by not being able to pursue further education. Currently, there are still many ideological obstacles and practical difficulties in mobilizing and organizing young students to engage in production labor. Some local Party committees, educational administrative departments, and Communist Youth League organizations only saw that the work in the summer of 1954 was relatively smooth, neglecting the difficulties that still existed, and developed a "good enough" mentality, and actual work also slackened accordingly. Although the summer vacation is approaching, they have not yet grasped this work firmly, which is not good. All localities should immediately further strengthen the propaganda and education work on junior middle school and senior primary school graduates engaging in production labor, and there should be no slackening.

Many facts prove that junior middle school and senior primary school graduates engaging in production labor have a great effect on realizing the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture. Because they have a certain cultural foundation and learn techniques quickly, many of them have become advanced producers in industrial production. For example, Li Dalin, a senior primary school graduate, has repeatedly improved tools in the four years he has worked at the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, and in 1953, he completed two years and six days' worth of work in seven months. In rural areas, in Henan Province alone, seventy-four counties already had more than 100,000 junior middle school and senior primary school graduates serving as directors of production cooperatives, leaders of mutual aid teams, accountants, propagandists, and teachers in people's schools, accounting for 87 percent of the total number of junior middle school and senior primary school graduates engaged in agricultural production. They have played an active role in agricultural production and various rural works. We should not only give sufficient consideration to the role that junior middle school and senior primary school graduates have already played in industrial and agricultural production; but also foresee that, under the continuous education of the Party and the government, they may be trained to become important backbones in industrial and agricultural production in the future. In the future, junior middle school and senior primary school graduates will be an important source for industrial and agricultural departments to train technical workers and agricultural production cooperative accountants, agricultural technicians, farm implement operators, agricultural technology extension station staff, and state farm trainees. This all shows that the participation of junior middle school and senior primary school graduates in industrial and agricultural production meets the needs of the national construction cause.

In order to better mobilize junior middle school and senior primary school graduates to engage in production labor, strengthening labor education in primary and secondary schools is an urgent task. Labor education is the fundamental issue of communist education and should be carried out regularly in schools at all levels and in every class. In 1954, primary and secondary schools in various localities focused on labor education for graduating students, which was very good; however, they neglected labor education for non-graduating classes and students in high schools and normal schools, which was a shortcoming. This shortcoming should be overcome in future work. At the same time, considering that the summer vacation is coming soon and that labor education in the past schools has not been done well enough, it is necessary to pay special attention to the guidance of graduating students, so that they can correctly handle their further education and employment issues in accordance with the policies of the Party and the government. In the propaganda and education work in 1954, many school leaders and teachers, due to a lack of correct understanding of labor education, made inappropriate, or even distorted, propaganda. For example, the erroneous propaganda that "further education is not glorious" is a clear example. We should educate students to recognize that labor is glorious, and further education is equally glorious. However, under the current conditions in our country, junior middle school and senior primary school graduates cannot all pursue further education, and only a small portion can pursue further education, while the majority must engage in production labor. We must give them a comprehensive and correct understanding of this issue.

In terms of methods of carrying out labor education, in the past year, many schools have adopted methods such as visiting factories, farms, and agricultural production cooperatives, visiting labor models, inviting labor models to give reports, holding get-togethers with young laborers, reading books with labor education significance, and participating in physical labor activities to conduct labor education for students outside of class, which has achieved good results. However, conducting labor education regularly through classroom teaching has been done relatively poorly. In the future, we must learn to implement labor education in classroom teaching, and we must also be good at combining in-class and out-of-class labor education. In the past, labor education in general schools focused on the ideological aspect, which is very important; however, education on the basic knowledge and skills of industrial and agricultural production has received very little attention. In the future, in addition to paying attention to cultivating students' labor viewpoints and labor habits, we should also actively create conditions to gradually implement basic production technology education, so that students can understand the basic knowledge of industrial and agricultural production in theory and practice (and learn abacus in the higher grades of primary school). In order to adapt to this requirement, the Ministry of Education should make further revisions to the teaching plans, teaching syllabi, and textbooks of primary and secondary schools.

Strengthening social propaganda work is of great significance for mobilizing junior middle school and senior primary school graduates to engage in production labor. The Constitution stipulates that "Labor is a glorious thing for all citizens of the People's Republic of China who have the ability to work." Citizens of New China should all have this idea. It is necessary to continue to publicize this idea to the people, criticize the exploiting class's ideas of despising physical labor and physical laborers, so as to form a social public opinion that labor is glorious and a social atmosphere that respects labor. This is an important aspect of the current struggle against bourgeois ideology and must be given sufficient attention.

For graduates who are already engaged in production labor, the departments concerned should further strengthen their education, improve their socialist consciousness, cultivate their conscious socialist attitude towards labor, make them love labor, be at ease in production, and give full play to their strengths. At the same time, their legitimate demands for further improvement of their political, cultural, and technical levels should be met appropriately through part-time study. In recent years, many Party organizations in factories, mines, enterprises, and rural areas have paid great attention to conducting political and ideological education for these young people, and have paid attention to cultivating typical examples, setting up role models, and educating everyone with typical examples. Many factories and mines and some agricultural production cooperatives have begun to pay attention to organizing these young people to study production technology. Communist Youth League organizations in many places have made great efforts to lead them in self-study and have achieved certain results. These are all good practices and are worth promoting.

Every parent has a responsibility to educate their children. Parents' education has a great influence on their children's thoughts and aspirations, and even has a decisive influence. Therefore, parents should improve their socialist consciousness, overcome the wrong ideas of despising physical labor and physical laborers, actively cooperate with schools to educate their children with socialist ideas, and constantly strengthen their labor education for their children. If their children cannot pursue further education, they should actively find ways to solve employment problems for their children. Propaganda and education departments and other relevant departments should actively educate parents so that they can better fulfill their responsibilities for educating their children. Primary and secondary schools should adopt various methods to establish a fixed parental work system, and schools with conditions can organize parent committees, so that school education can often obtain parents' cooperation, help, and supervision. According to the experience of 1954, it is not enough for parental work to be done only by schools, and mass organizations (such as the Democratic Women's Federation, etc.) and grassroots cadres should also be mobilized to work on parents.

In order to mobilize junior middle school and senior primary school graduates to participate in production labor, in addition to doing a good job in propaganda and education, it is also necessary to do a good job in organizational arrangements. It should be understood that after students have completed primary and secondary school education, they should participate in production labor if they cannot pursue further education. The state should do its best to help solve their employment problems, but not adopt a policy of taking over everything. Some state workers still do not understand this point and attempt to solve the employment problems of all junior middle school and senior primary school graduates who cannot pursue further education. In addition, some places, when assisting in solving the employment problems of junior middle school and senior primary school graduates, overemphasize assigning them to participate in industrial production, which is not entirely in line with the current reality. In order to do a good job in the organizational arrangements for graduates, the departments concerned should coordinate and cooperate, formulate plans in a timely manner, and prepare early. In 1954, some cities adopted the method of local resettlement and parents seeking employment on their own for graduates who could not participate in factory and mine production, so that they engaged in handicraft production or other industries. Some rural areas made preparations in advance, and when graduates returned to the village, they were planned to be arranged into mutual aid and cooperative organizations. These practices are all very good. The shortcoming of the organizational work in 1954 was that the planning was not sufficient. Some employers submitted plans too late, and some plans changed too much after they were submitted, which caused difficulties in the allocation work. At the same time, the division of labor among relevant units was not clear enough, and mutual cooperation was not close enough, so that some provinces and cities had many surplus primary and secondary school graduates, while other provinces and cities did not have enough distribution, and could not meet the requirements of employers. In addition, some units had overly harsh and high requirements for selecting primary and secondary school graduates, and refused to employ female students even if they could. These shortcomings must be overcome in future work.

Mobilizing junior middle school and senior primary school graduates to engage in production labor is a long-term and arduous task, and all localities should have long-term plans and continuously strengthen this work to ensure the smooth implementation of this task.

　　继续动员初中和高小毕业生从事生产劳动
    动员和组织初中和高小毕业生从事生产劳动，近两年来已经有了很大的成绩。特别是一九五四年，各地根据党和政府的政策，发动了各方面的力量，对社会各阶层、学生家长、已经毕业的和在校的学生，进行了比较广泛而深入的宣传教育工作。同时加强了中小学应届毕业生的升学和就业指导，因而初步转变了轻视毕业生参加生产劳动的社会风气，顺利地解决了毕业生升学和从事生产劳动的问题，并给今年的工作打下了更好的基础。
    在目前以及今后相当长的时期内，国家对初中和高小毕业生的基本政策，除招考少部分人升学外，主要是号召、组织一部分人去从事工业生产，大部分人去从事农业生产，参加互助合作运动。我们应该使中小学学生明白学习的目的，就是要使自己变成有政治觉悟和文化教养的人，更好地从事生产劳动。他们在中小学毕业以后，就应当遵从国家的政策，能升学就升学，不能升学就自觉地愉快地去从事生产劳动或做别的工作，不应为不能升学而苦恼。当前动员和组织青年学生从事生产劳动的思想障碍和实际困难还是很多的。有些地方党委、教育行政部门、青年团组织只看到一九五四年暑期的工作比较顺利，忽略了仍然存在的困难，产生了“差不多”的思想，实际工作也就跟着松懈下来。目前暑期虽已临近，他们还没有抓紧这一工作，这是不好的。各地应即进一步加强关于初中和高小毕业生从事生产劳动的宣传教育工作，不应有丝毫松懈。
    许多事实证明，初中和高小毕业生从事生产劳动，对实现国家的社会主义工业化和农业的社会主义改造，都有着很大的作用。由于他们有一定的文化基础，学习技术较快，有不少人在工业生产中成为先进生产者。如高小毕业生李达林在沈阳重型机器厂工作四年中，多次改进工具，一九五三年以七个月的时间完成了两年零六天的工作量。在农村，仅河南省七十四个县即已有十万多初中和高小毕业生担任了生产合作社主任、互助组长、会计员、宣传员、民校教师等工作，占从事农业生产的初中和高小毕业生总数的百分之八十七。他们在农业生产和农村各项工作中都发挥了积极作用。我们不仅应当对初中和高小毕业生在工农业生产中已经发挥的作用给以足够的估计；而且还应当预见到，在党和政府的不断教育下，他们将来还可能锻炼成为工农业生产中的重要骨干。今后工业部门和农业部门训练技术工人和农业生产合作社的会计员、农业技术员、农具手、农业技术推广站工作人员及国营农场见习生，初中和高小毕业生是一个重要来源。这都说明，初中和高小毕业生参加工农业生产是符合国家建设事业的需要的。
    为了更好地动员初中和高小毕业生从事生产劳动，加强中小学的劳动教育，是一项迫切的工作。劳动教育是共产主义教育的根本问题，应当在各级学校和各个班级经常进行。一九五四年各地中小学抓紧了对应届毕业生的劳动教育，这是很好的；但是忽视了非毕业班和高中、师范学校学生的劳动教育，却是一个缺点。这个缺点应当在今后的工作中加以克服。同时考虑到暑期很快就要到来，而过去各校的劳动教育还做得不够，因此须要特别注意对于应届毕业生的指导，以便使他们能够按照党和政府的政策来正确处理自己的升学和就业问题。在一九五四年的宣传教育工作中，许多学校的领导人员和教师，由于对劳动教育缺乏正确的理解，曾经作了不恰当的，甚至是歪曲的宣传，如错误地宣传
  “升学不光荣”，就是明显的例证。我们应当教育学生认识劳动是光荣的，升学同样是光荣的。但在我国现实条件下，初中和高小毕业生还不可能全部升学，而升学的还只能是一小部分，大部分人要从事生产劳动。我们要使他们对这一问题有一个全面的正确的认识。
    在进行劳动教育的方法上，在过去的一年中，很多学校采取参观工厂、农场、农业生产合作社，访问劳动模范，请劳动模范作报告，同劳动青年联欢，阅读有劳动教育意义的读物，参加体力劳动活动等方式，在课外对学生进行劳动教育，收到了很好的效果。但是，通过课堂教学，经常地进行劳动教育，就作得比较差。今后必须学会在课堂教学中贯彻劳动教育，并且还要善于使课内外的劳动教育结合起来。过去一般学校的劳动教育，都着重在思想方面，这是很重要的；但是对工农业生产的基础知识和技能的教育却注意得很差。今后除了注意培养学生的劳动观点和劳动习惯以外，还应当积极创造条件，逐步施行基本生产技术教育，使学生从理论上和实践上懂得工农业生产的基础知识（在小学高年级并应学习珠算）。为了适应这种要求，教育部应当对中小学的教学计划、教学大纲、教科书等作进一步的修改。
    加强社会宣传工作，对动员初中和高小毕业生从事生产劳动有着重要意义。宪法规定：“劳动是中华人民共和国一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣的事情。”新中国的公民都应当有这种思想。必须继续向人民群众宣传这种思想，批判轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者的剥削阶级思想，以形成劳动光荣的社会舆论和尊重劳动的社会风气。这是当前同资产阶级思想作斗争的一个重要方面，必须给以足够的重视。
    对于已经从事生产劳动的毕业生，各有关部门应当进一步加强对他们的教育，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，培养他们对劳动的自觉的社会主义的态度，使他们热爱劳动，安心生产，充分发挥他们的力量。同时，对他们进一步提高政治、文化和技术水平的正当要求，要采取业余学习的方式，适当地给以满足。近年来，有很多厂矿、企业和农村的党组织很注意对这些青年进行政治思想教育，并注意培养典型，树立榜样，用典型事例教育大家。还有很多厂矿和一些农业生产合作社已开始注意到组织这些青年学习生产技术。有很多地方的青年团组织对领导他们自学作了很大的努力，并获得了一定的成绩。这都是很好的作法，值得提倡。
    每一个家长都有责任教育自己的子女。父母的教育对子女的思想和志向有着很大的影响，甚至有决定性的影响。因此，做父母的都应当提高自己的社会主义觉悟，克服轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者的错误思想，积极协同学校用社会主义思想教育子女，不断地加强对子女的劳动教育。如果子女不能升学，就应当积极地想办法，为子女解决就业问题。宣传教育部门以及其他有关部门，则应当积极向家长进行教育，使他们更好地履行自己对子女的教育的责任。中小学校则应当采取各种方式建立固定的家长工作制度，有条件的学校可以组织家长委员会，使学校教育能够经常取得家长的配合、帮助和监督。根据一九五四年的经验，家长工作仅由学校来做是很不够的，还应当发动群众团体（如民主妇女联合会等）和基层干部对家长进行工作。
    为了动员初中和高小毕业生参加生产劳动，除了做好宣传教育工作以外，还必须做好组织安排工作。应当了解，学生在受完中小学教育以后，如果不能升学，就应参加生产劳动。对于他们的就业问题，国家要尽力协助解决，但不是采取包下来的政策。这一点，有些国家工作人员还不了解，企图解决所有不能升学的初中和高小毕业生的就业问题。另外，也有些地方在协助解决初中和高小毕业生就业问题的时候，过分强调分配他们参加工业生产，这是不完全符合当前实际情况的。为了做好毕业生的组织安排工作，各有关部门应当配合一致，及时制定计划，早作准备。在一九五四年，有些城市对不能参加厂矿生产的毕业生，采取了就地安置和由家长自谋职业的办法，使他们从事手工业生产或其他行业。有些农村地区，事先作好准备，等毕业生回到村里，就有计划地把他们安排到互助合作组织里去。这些作法都是很好的。一九五四年组织工作的缺点是计划性不够，有些用人单位提出计划过晚，有的计划提出后又变动太多，使调配工作发生困难。同时，有关单位的分工也还不够明确，互相配合不够密切，以致有的省、市中小学毕业生剩余很多，另一些省、市又不够分配，满足不了用人单位的要求。此外，还有些单位对选择中小学毕业生要求过苛、过高，可以录用女生的也拒绝录用。这些缺点在今后的工作中必须克服。
    动员初中和高小毕业生从事生产劳动，是一项长期的艰巨的任务，各地应当有长远打算，不断加强这一工作，以保证这一任务的顺利执行。
