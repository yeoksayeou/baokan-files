　　More than 450,000 Farm Households in South Korea Lack Food
　　According to figures released by the Syngman Rhee group's "Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry," as of the end of April, the number of farm households lacking food in various parts of South Korea had reached 458,300, an increase of 24,300 compared to the end of March.
　　According to the "Haptong News Agency," the food shortage is expected to continue to worsen, and "approximately 60,000 more households may be added during the lean month of May."
　　Number of British Coal Miners on Strike Increases to 60,000
　　The strike by coal miners in the Doncaster coal mining area of Britain, which began in February to demand higher wages, has rapidly spread to many other mining areas in Yorkshire. According to Agence France-Presse, as of the 4th, the number of strikers had increased to about 60,000; thirty-three mines had completely ceased production.
　　70 Major U.S. Companies Have Assets Exceeding $1 Billion
　　At the end of 1954, there were as many as 70 major U.S. companies with assets of $1 billion or more.
　　At the end of World War II, there were only 43 such large companies. The domestic and foreign policies pursued by the agents of U.S. monopoly capital in the government have made the monopolists rich. In the short nine years after the war, 27 companies expanded their wealth to more than $1 billion. The original 43 companies also greatly expanded their assets.
　　At the end of 1954, the total assets of these 70 companies reached $201.4 billion, an increase of nearly $13 billion over 1953. If these assets were owned by the entire American people, it would be equivalent to an average of more than $1,200 per American.
　　Currently, the top three of these 70 major companies are the "Metropolitan Life Insurance Company" belonging to the Rockefeller Consortium, and the "Bell Telephone Company" and the "Prudential Insurance Company" belonging to the Morgan Consortium. Each company has assets exceeding $10 billion.

    美国有七十家大公司资产超过十亿美元
    在一九五四年年底，拥有资产十亿美元或者十亿美元以上的美国大公司已经有七十家之多。
    在第二次世界大战结束的时候，这种大公司还只有四十三家。美国垄断资本在政府中的代理人所执行的对内对外政策，使垄断资本家大发横财。在战后短短的九年内，二十七家公司把它们的财富扩大到了十亿美元以上。原来的四十三家也大大扩大了资产。
    一九五四年年底，这七十家公司的总资产共达二千零十四亿美元，比一九五三年增加了将近一百三十亿美元。如果这些资产为美国全民所有，相当于每个美国人平均有一千二百多美元。
    目前，在这七十家大公司中列在前三名的是属于洛克菲勒财团的“都会人寿保险公司”和属于摩根财团的“贝尔电话公司”和“万全保险公司”。每家公司的资产都超过一百亿美元。
