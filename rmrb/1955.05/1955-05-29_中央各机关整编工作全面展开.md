　　The work of streamlining institutions and reducing staffing levels in central-level agencies has been fully launched.

　　Currently, most agencies have convened meetings of activists, communicated the Central Committee's instructions regarding the streamlining of central-level agencies, and made specific arrangements for the streamlining work in their respective units. Some agencies have communicated this to all cadres and mobilized the masses to start discussions. Some units with relatively rapid progress, such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, and the Bureau of Government Affairs Administration of the State Council, have put forward preliminary streamlining plans, planning to reduce the existing number of personnel by more than 50 percent.

　　Through preliminary inspection, various agencies have discovered many serious and unreasonable phenomena in their organizational structure, staffing levels, and work processes. The phenomenon of large institutions, overlapping layers, and excessive personnel is quite common. Many departments blindly set up institutions and increase staffing levels without considering actual needs, leading to a rapid increase in the number of personnel and overstaffing. Many cadres are uneasy because they have no work or very little work. Some agencies have accumulated many backbones but have not allowed them to fully play their roles. Due to large institutions and excessive personnel, bureaucratic and red tape tendencies in work have been fostered. For example, many agencies have unclear responsibilities and ambiguous division of labor, often resulting in mutual evasion of responsibility. Some agencies are dominated by official documents, telegrams, and statistical reports, resulting in cumbersome, slow, and inefficient procedures. All these unreasonable phenomena have caused damage to the work.

　　In this streamlining effort, all agencies, from leading cadres to general cadres, both inside and outside the Party, have been extensively engaged in ideological mobilization, pointing out the harm caused to the work by the above-mentioned unreasonable phenomena, and calling on them to fully promote democracy, boldly expose shortcomings, and actively put forward suggestions for improvement. Currently, the responsible persons of various agencies have strengthened their leadership over this work, taking personal charge and assigning responsibility at each level. The responsible persons of many departments have repeatedly conducted mobilization and resolutely implemented the Central Committee's streamlining spirit. They also stated that they would thoroughly overcome the bureaucratic and red tape style of work through this streamlining effort. Currently, the streamlining work has been rapidly launched in all units where leading cadres have taken personal charge.

　　The Chinese Communist Party members in various agencies have played an active role in the streamlining work. They have led the cadres of their respective departments in promoting the spirit of democracy, boldly exposing shortcomings, and putting forward many opinions on improving leadership and improving work. The Communist Party members and non-Party cadres of the Ministry of Internal Affairs have put forward many constructive opinions, providing a practical basis for the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to formulate new staffing plans. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the streamlining work, the Party organizations of many agencies have conducted in-depth mobilization within the Party. Communist Party members have expressed their determination to resolutely obey organizational assignments and ensure the smooth completion of the streamlining work.

　　中央各机关整编工作全面展开
    新华社二十七日讯　中央一级机关整顿机构精简编制的工作已经全面展开。
    现在大部分机关都召开了活动分子会议，传达了中央关于中央一级机关整编工作的指示，并对本单位的整编工作作了具体的部署。有些机关已向全体干部进行了传达，并发动群众展开讨论。有些进展较快的单位，如农业部、内务部、轻工业部、第二机械工业部和国务院机关事务管理局等部门已提出初步整编方案，计划精减现有人数的百分之五十以上。
    各机关经过初步检查，发现机构、编制上和工作上有许多严重不合理的现象。机构庞大、层次重叠、人员众多的现象相当普遍。不少部门不根据实际需要，盲目地设置机构和增加编制，使机关人员迅速增多，人浮于事；不少干部因为没有工作或工作很少而不安心，有些机关积压了很多骨干，没有使他们充分地发挥作用。由于机构大、人员多，也就助长了工作中的官僚主义、文牍主义倾向。如不少机关职责不清，分工不明，常常发生互相推脱责任的现象；有些机关公文、电报、统计报表盛行，办起事来手续繁琐、拖拉迟缓，效率不高。这种种不合理的现象，都给工作造成了损害。
    在这次整编中，各机关从领导干部到一般干部，从党内到党外，普遍进行思想动员，向他们指明以上各种不合理的现象对于工作所造成的危害，号召他们充分发扬民主，大胆揭发缺点，积极提出改进的建议。现在，各机关的负责人都加强了对这一工作的领导，亲自动手，层层负责。许多部门的负责人反复进行动员，坚决贯彻中央整编精神。他们并表示要通过这次整编工作，彻底克服工作中的官僚主义和文牍主义作风。现在凡是领导干部亲自动手的单位，整编工作都迅速地开展起来。
    各机关的中国共产党党员在整编工作中，都发挥了积极作用。他们带动本部门的机关干部，发扬民主精神，大胆地揭发缺点，提出了许多改善领导、改进工作的意见。内务部的共产党员和非党干部提出了许多建设性的意见，给内务部领导方面制定新的编制方案提供了切实的根据。不少机关的党组织为了保证整编工作的顺利进行，在党内进行了深入的动员，共产党员们都表示要坚决服从组织分配，保证整编工作的顺利完成。
