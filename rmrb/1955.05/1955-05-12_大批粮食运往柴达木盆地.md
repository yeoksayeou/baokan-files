　　Large Quantities of Grain Transported to Qaidam Basin
    The Qinghai Province Grain Bureau is transporting large quantities of grain to the Qaidam Basin and pastoral areas. Since March, more than 2.3 million jin of flour and rice have been transported to Golmud. Yaks and camel teams, organized by people of all ethnic groups in the Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Region of Qinghai Province, are carrying this grain to exploration construction sites.
    On the highway from Xining to Guide County, many large carts are also transporting grain, and 1,000 tons will be transported to Guide in May. After this grain arrives in Guide County, it will be transported by yak to the Hainan and Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Regions to supply herdsmen with food. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　大批粮食运往柴达木盆地
    青海省粮食局正把大批粮食运往柴达木盆地和牧业区。从三月到现在已有二百三十多万斤面粉和大米运到格尔穆。由青海省海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治区各族人民组织起来的牦牛队和骆驼队，正在把这批粮食驮运到勘探工地。
    从西宁到贵德县的公路上，目前也有许多大车在运粮，五月份将运到贵德一千吨。这些粮食到贵德县后，再用牦牛驮运到海南和黄南两个藏族自治区，供应牧民食用。（新华社）
