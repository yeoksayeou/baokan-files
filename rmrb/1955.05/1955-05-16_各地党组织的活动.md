Starting with Opening Cadres' Minds

　　The tenth district of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, was originally a grain-producing area. Most farmers not only had enough grain to eat but also had a surplus. However, due to the inadequate educational work regarding the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and the failure to deeply mobilize the masses, farmers universally demanded that the state supply grain. Cadres also generally believed that increasing the grain supply was the only way to solve the unified sales problem.

　　In order to start by opening the minds of cadres, the Tenth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting of more than eighty Party member cadres from the district to study the policy and inspect the grain unified sales situation. It was discovered that many cases of supply were improper, such as granting a grain purchase certificate for 200 catties to landlord Yang Pinhong of Guangming Township, who had surplus grain, and granting a grain purchase certificate for 300 catties to middle peasant Yang Zuohong, who had surplus grain. However, Zhou Nengcai, who was genuinely short of grain, did not receive any supply. The meeting then discussed using miscellaneous grains and early-maturing crops to reduce the amount of grain supplied. Everyone agreed that the "Nante" rice, which had been transplanted for sixty days and would soon mature, should be calculated as part of the farmers' grain income, and that there was still a considerable amount of miscellaneous grain in the countryside. Only those farmers whose grain was still insufficient after accounting for these two factors should be supplied with grain. Finally, the Party member cadres attending the meeting made detailed calculations based on this spirit. Many Party member cadres not only no longer needed the government to supply grain but could also save some grain to solve the difficulties of genuinely grain-deficient households. For example, Liang Hanyou, the director of the first agricultural cooperative in Minzhong Township, believed that he could save 330 catties of grain and estimated that the entire cooperative could save more than 2,000 catties of grain to be transferred to grain-deficient households. The branch secretary of Jinbiao Township also wanted to save 570 catties of grain to give to genuinely grain-deficient farmers.

　　As a result, out of the original eighty-plus Party member cadres who requested grain supply, only nineteen households were genuinely grain-deficient. Everyone then fully realized that the so-called grain shortage in the past was not a genuine lack of grain, but an artificial shortage, resulting from our rural Party organizations' failure to deeply propagate the Party's grain unified sales policy to the masses and mobilize the masses to solve grain difficulties.

　　This meeting was a most practical education for everyone, not only making them clearly understand the policy but also providing them with methods to implement the policy. Therefore, they were filled with confidence in conducting unified sales make-up lessons after returning to their villages to eliminate artificial grain shortages. (Ai Ling)

Must Pay Attention to the Education of Labor Models

　　Frequently educating labor models, making them humble and prudent, and connecting them with the masses is an important task of Party organizations at all levels, especially at the grassroots level. It is precisely because Party organizations at all levels in the Wendeng area of Shandong Province did not pay attention to this task that many labor models became arrogant and complacent, even developing to the point of disregarding organization and becoming detached from the masses. In order to correct this deviation, the Wendeng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a symposium of Party members among agricultural labor models and the general branch secretaries of their townships from the end of March to the beginning of April. This symposium not only educated the labor models themselves but also educated the rural Party branches. Tang Shikai, a labor model from Rongcheng County, used to be arrogant and self-satisfied, disobeying the leadership of the township branch and refusing to accept the supervision of the masses. After this education, he realized that the honor of labor model was not obtained personally but was the result of the education and cultivation of the Party and the people. He promised to be humble in the future, obey the leadership of the township branch, and listen to the opinions of the masses. Yu Changying, a labor model from Fushan County, also criticized her erroneous thinking of looking down on the branch and being arrogant and complacent, and stated that she would make a self-criticism in the branch after returning and earnestly correct her mistakes.

　　The general branch secretaries of the townships who attended the symposium also criticized their past erroneous thinking that labor models should be managed by the higher-level Party committee and that the township branch could not manage them. They realized that helping and educating labor models is a responsibility that the branch cannot shirk. (Communications Group of the Wendeng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party)

Developing New Party Members in Rural Areas of Southern Xinjiang

　　Last year, the Party organizations in the Southern Xinjiang region of Xinjiang Province made new progress, admitting a total of 2,237 new Party members and establishing 205 new rural branches.

　　These new Party members have clear histories, are upright in their conduct, can connect with the masses, have been tempered by various movements, and are mostly backbone elements in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Among the 736 new rural Party members developed in ten counties including Gashi, Wensu, Moyu, and Shache, 487 are from poor peasant backgrounds, but most have joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and more than half of them hold positions such as mutual aid team leader, cooperative chairman/vice-chairman, and cooperative committee member.

　　These new Party members have played an active role in promoting the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the establishment of cooperatives in various places, in addition to persuading their parents and educating their wives to take the lead in signing up to join the cooperatives, the new Party members also used the method of relatives introducing relatives and friends introducing friends to propagate the joining of cooperatives to others. Last year, the number of mutual aid teams in eight townships of the sixth district of Kashgar City increased from 25 to 43. In the development of this batch of new mutual aid teams, the new Party members also played a great leading and propaganda role. Aymat Imamiti, a new Party member in Xiao Kao Hu Township, Shufu County, persuaded his father to contribute ten mu of alfalfa land to the cooperative, which influenced Awuti and three other farmers to contribute seven mu of alfalfa land to the cooperative as well.

　　In order to adapt to the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, this year the entire Southern Xinjiang region plans to continue to develop 4,142 new Party members and establish 340 new rural branches on the basis of consolidating the existing rural Party organizations. It also plans to build six Party branches and develop 37 new Party members in pastoral areas on a trial basis. (Zhao Shijie)

Must Both Complete Production and Pay Attention to Safety

　　Among some cadres in the Hegang Coal Mine, there is a serious erroneous thinking of emphasizing production and neglecting safety. They emphasize that coal mining is "underground operation," "workers have high mobility, and there are few hereditary workers," and that "safety equipment is not as good as the Soviet Union," believing that accidents are "inevitable." Therefore, they are unwilling to earnestly implement the Party's safety production policy in enterprises. Although the mine conducted a thought critique of neglecting safety among employees at the end of last year, and the situation has changed somewhat, the thinking of neglecting safety production has not been eradicated. As a result, phenomena such as failing to conscientiously organize workers to implement operating procedures, operating procedures themselves violating the regulations and systems stipulated by the state, and failing to investigate accidents that have already occurred are still quite common. As a result, accidents are increasing daily. In March, three workers were injured or killed due to violating operating procedures.

　　In order to further overcome the above-mentioned thinking of neglecting safety production, the Hegang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a city-wide cadre meeting in mid-April, analyzed the situation and causes of accidents with concrete facts, and mobilized all cadres to launch a critique of the bourgeois management thinking of neglecting worker safety. The Municipal Committee also pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to earnestly educate employees on safety production to ensure the completion of production tasks under safe conditions. (Yi Sheng)

Correcting the Thought of Neglecting Mutual Aid Teams

　　The work team and township cadres of Yuhe Township, Taiping County, Anhui Province, only focused on establishing cooperatives and relaxed their leadership over mutual aid teams, which further fueled the thinking of some masses who looked down on mutual aid teams, resulting in the disintegration of many mutual aid teams and affecting spring plowing production. For example, some fallow fields of the Zhang Jinqian mutual aid team were left unplowed, and the members of the He Huarong mutual aid team wanted to transfer to a cooperative, but they did not meet the conditions and were dissatisfied with the mutual aid team, resulting in low production morale.

　　After the county Party committee work team and the township branch discovered this situation, they immediately conducted education among cadres and the masses, explaining that doing a good job in mutual aid teams is the foundation for developing agricultural cooperatives, and explaining the several conditions that must be met to establish a cooperative. This reversed the thinking of the masses who looked down on mutual aid teams. Then, they distributed all 500 catties of potato seeds reissued by the district in the second batch to seven mutual aid teams, solving their production difficulties. The branch also designated two relatively strong Party member cadres to help three constituencies that had not established agricultural cooperatives to rectify the mutual aid teams. After education and rectification, the members of the Zhang Jinqian mutual aid team and the He Huarong mutual aid team actively engaged in spring plowing production. The sixth constituency not only consolidated the existing mutual aid teams but also developed a mutual aid team. (Fang Zheng)

### 各地党组织的活动

　　各地党组织的活动
    从打通干部的思想入手
    广东中山县十区，原是一个产粮区。多数农民不但粮食够吃，还有剩余。但由于粮食统购统销政策的教育工作没有做好，又没有深入发动群众，以致农民普遍要求国家供应粮食。干部也普遍认为：只有增加粮食供应才能解决统销问题。
    为了首先从打通干部思想入手，中共十区区委会最近召开了全区八十多个党员干部参加的会议，学习了政策、并对粮食统销情况作了检查。发现不该供应而供应了的情况是很多的，如光明乡地主杨品洪是余粮户，也发给了他二百斤购粮证，中农杨左洪是余粮户，也发给了他三百斤购粮证。而真正缺粮的周能彩却没得到供应。接着会议又讨论了利用杂粮和早熟作物以减少粮食供应的数额。大家一致认为现已插秧六十天即可成熟的“南特”号稻，应该计算在农民的粮食收入之内，而杂粮在农村还有相当数量。在算了这两笔账之后粮食仍然不够的农户才应该供应粮食。最后，参加会议的党员干部根据这一精神算了一下细账，很多党员干部不但不再要政府供应，还可以节约出部分粮食解决真正缺粮户的困难。如民众乡第一农业社社长梁汗有，认为自己可以节约出三百三十斤粮食，估计全社可以节约二千多斤粮食调剂给缺粮户，锦标乡的支部书记也要节约五百七十斤谷让给真正缺粮的农民。
    结果，原来要求粮食供应的八十多个党员干部，现在，只有十九户是真正的缺粮户。大家这才充分认识到过去所谓的粮食紧张不是真正的粮食不够，是一种人为的紧张，是我们农村党组织没有深入群众宣传党的粮食统销政策，并发动群众解决粮食困难的结果。
    这次会议对大家是一次最切实的教育，使大家不但明确地懂得了政策，也有了贯彻政策的办法，因此对回乡以后进行统销补课消除人为的粮食紧张充满了信心。  （艾  玲）
    必须注意对劳动模范的教育
    经常教育劳动模范，使他们谦虚谨慎，联系群众是各级党组织，特别是基层党组织的一项重要任务。山东省文登地区各级党组织正是由于没有重视这一任务，致使不少劳动模范骄傲自满起来，甚至已发展到目无组织，脱离群众的地步。中共文登地委为了纠正这一偏向，在三月底到四月初召集全区农业劳动模范中的党员，和他们所在乡的总支书记座谈。这次座谈，不但教育了劳动模范本人，也教育了农村党支部。荣成县劳动模范唐士凯过去居功自傲，不服从乡支部的领导，不接受群众的监督。经过这次教育，他才认识到劳动模范的荣誉并不是个人得来的，而是党和人民教育培养的结果。他保证今后一定要谦虚起来，服从乡支部的领导，倾听群众的意见。福山县劳动模范于昌英也批判了自己看不起支部，骄傲自满的错误思想，并表示回去以后要在支部里作检讨，切实改正自己的错误。
    参加座谈会的乡总支书记也批判了自己过去认为劳动模范应由上级党委管、乡支部管不了的错误思想，认识到帮助和教育劳动模范是支部不能推卸的责任。  （中共文登地委办公室通讯组）
    南疆农村发展新党员
    去年，新疆省南疆区的党组织又有了新的发展，共吸收新党员二千二百三十七名，新建农村支部二百零五个。
    这批新党员历史清楚，作风正派，能联系群众，经过各种运动的锻炼，而且大部分是互助合作运动中的骨干分子。在伽师、温宿、墨玉、莎车等十个县发展的七百三十六名农村新党员中，就有四百八十七名党员是贫农出身，但大多数已加入了互助合作组织，其中有一半以上担任了互助组长、正副社长、社务委员等职务。
    这批新党员对农村互助合作运动的发展起了积极的推动作用。各地在建社中，新党员除说服父母、教育妻子带头报名入社外，还运用亲串亲、友串友的方法，去宣传别人入社。去年，喀什市六区八乡的互助组由二十五个发展到四十三个，在发展这批新的互助组中，新党员也起了很大的带头和宣传作用。疏附县肖攷胡乡新党员艾买提麻木提，说服父亲把十亩苜蓿地入社后，影响了阿吾提等三户农民，也跟着把七亩苜蓿地入了社。
    为了适应农村互助合作运动的发展，今年南疆全区计划在巩固原有农村党组织的基础上，继续发展四千一百四十二名新党员，新建三百四十个农村支部。并计划在牧区试建六个党支部，发展三十七名新党员。  （赵世杰）
    既要完成生产又要注意安全
    在鹤岗煤矿的某些干部中，存在着严重的重视生产不重视安全的错误思想。他们强调煤矿生产是
  “地下作业”、“工人流动性大，血统工人少”、“安全设备不如苏联”，认为事故“不可避免”，因而不愿认真贯彻党在企业中的安全生产方针。去年年底，矿内虽然在职工中进行了一次忽视安全的思想批判，情况也有所转变，但是忽视安全生产的思想并未肃清，因此，不认真组织工人执行作业规程的现象、作业规程本身就违反了国家规定的规程制度的现象、对已发生的事故不加追究的现象，仍然相当普遍地存在着。结果是事故日增，三月份因违反操作规程而伤亡的工人就有三名。
    为了进一步克服上述忽视安全生产的思想，中共鹤岗市委在四月中旬召开全市干部大会，通过具体事实，向大家分析了发生事故的情况和原因，动员全体干部对忽视工人安全的资产阶级经营思想展开批判。市委又指出今后必须切实向职工进行安全生产的教育，保证在安全条件下完成生产任务。
                                  （逸  生）
    纠正忽视互助组的思想
    安徽省太平县玉河乡的工作组和乡干部由于只顾办社，放松了对互助组的领导，就更加助长了部分群众轻视互助组的思想，以致很多互助组组织涣散，影响了春耕生产。比如张金钱互助组的部分休闲田摆着没人犁，何华荣互助组的组员们想转社，条件不够，又不满意互助组，结果是生产情绪不高。
    县委工作组和乡支部发现这一情况后，立即在干部和群众中进行教育，说明办好互助组是发展农业社的基础，说明办社必须具备的几个条件，这才扭转了群众中的轻视互助组的思想。接着把区里第二批补发的五百斤马铃薯种子全部配发给七个互助组，解决了他们生产上的困难。支部又指定两个较强的党员干部帮助三个没有建立农业社的选区整顿互助组。张金钱互助组和何华荣互助组组员们经过教育整顿后，都积极投入春耕生产。六选区不但巩固了原有的互助组，还发展了一个互助组。
