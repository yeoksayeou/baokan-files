To the Editor:

Recently, the Shangrao Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party assigned me to work at the Shangrao Automotive Maintenance Depot of the Fujian Transportation Bureau. This enterprise is responsible for automotive maintenance and repair, and the specific work of managing vehicle operations. The labor enthusiasm of all employees in the enterprise is truly inspiring.

This is an advanced automotive transportation unit. In 1954, they exceeded their transportation plan, saving 14,480 kilograms of gasoline fuel compared to the central technical quota. The first quarter of this year was also completed very well.

There are many reasons for the continuous great achievements of this enterprise, and one of the main reasons is that the leaders of the depot care about the lives of their employees and are good at using their own practical actions to inspire the workers' labor enthusiasm. The depot has established a regular safety inspection system and safety activity days. In March of this year, the vehicle turnover rate increased, the task was heavy, and the weather was getting hotter; in order to reduce the fatigue of the drivers, the depot's leaders formed a working group to replace the returning drivers in loading and unloading goods and handling travel procedures in the evenings, so that the drivers could rest in time and start again with full energy the next morning. In the evenings, the depot chief, deputy chief, and instructor take turns on duty to inspect the work, and the mechanical department promptly repairs all vehicles returning at night and those to be driven out the next morning. In March of this year, a bathhouse was built in the depot, with hot water available every day from 12:00 noon to 12:00 midnight. Repair personnel can take a refreshing bath in their own bathroom as soon as they get off work, and drivers can do the same as soon as they return. The canteen work in the depot is also constantly improving. In order to ensure that drivers can eat in time when they return, this canteen provides meals at any time from 8:00 in the morning to 12:00 midnight every day, and there are many styles of food at very cheap prices. Since the first quarter, the depot's doctors and nurses have been carrying medicine kits to the workshops and dormitories every day, so that workers who are slightly injured or have minor illnesses due to work can receive timely treatment and continue working. Now, the workers are working hard and happily to complete the task of transporting materials.

　　福建运输局上饶汽车保养场关心工人生活无微不至编辑同志：
    最近，中共上饶市委派我到福建运输局上饶保养场去工作，这个企业是汽车保养修理和掌握车辆行驶的具体工作单位，企业全体职工的劳动热忱真是令人感动。
    这是一个先进的汽车运输单位。它们在一九五四年超额完成了运输计划，汽油燃料消耗量比中央技术定额节约一万四千四百八十公斤。今年第一季度的任务也完成得很好。
    这个企业不断获得巨大成绩，有多方面的原因，其中一个主要原因是场的领导人员关心职工生活，善于用自己的实际行动来激发工人的劳动热忱。这个场规定有经常的安全检查制度，安全活动日。今年三月份，车辆周转速度提高，任务重，而且天气渐热；为了减轻驾驶人员的疲劳，场的领导干部们就组成了一个工作组，在晚间代替回场的驾驶员装卸货和办理行车手续，使驾驶员能够及时休息，第二天早上又能精神饱满地出发。晚上，场长、副场长和指导员三人轮流值班检查工作，所有晚间回来的车子和明早要开的车子，机务部门都及时进行检修。今年三月，场内建成了一个澡堂，每天从中午十二时到晚上十二时全有热水供应。修理人员一下班，行车人员一回来，就可以痛快地在自己的浴室里洗澡。场里的食堂工作也在不断地改进着。为了让行车人员开车回来就能及时吃到饭，这个食堂每天早晨八时到晚上十二时随时可以供膳，而且饭菜样式很多，价钱也很便宜。从第一季度起，场里的医生、护士，每天都带着药包到车间、宿舍，使临时因工作受轻伤或患了小病的工人能及时得到治疗，继续工作。现在，工人们正以紧张愉快的劳动来完成物资运输任务。
