　　A Historical Problem Reasonably Resolved
　　By Our Correspondent Wu Wentao
    On the morning of April 22nd, before the group discussions of the Asian-African Conference had even begun, the front of the West Java Provincial Government office in Bandung, usually solemn and dignified, was a hive of activity, with cars and crowds gathering. The signing ceremony of the Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on the Question of Dual Nationality was held here.

    The signing ceremony, including the speeches by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Sunaryo, lasted only twenty minutes, but everyone present felt that this was a historically significant event—a historical problem reasonably resolved. In particular, the fact that this treaty was signed during the Asian-African Conference made the impression all the more profound. Because, in the first two days of the Asian-African Conference, some people even used the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese as material to disrupt the conference.

    Indeed, the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese, which existed between China and Southeast Asian countries, was a long-standing problem left over from history. As far as Indonesia is concerned, many overseas Chinese were in the past both subjects of the Dutch East Indies and citizens of China. Experience has shown that the existence of dual nationality for overseas Chinese is not beneficial to the overseas Chinese, not beneficial to the Indonesian people, not beneficial to the friendly relations between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people, but is beneficial to the colonialists in implementing a policy of instigating discord and "divide and rule" between overseas Chinese and local people.

    Today, the situation is different. The independent countries of Southeast Asia hope to solve this problem, and the People's Republic of China also hopes to reasonably end the phenomenon of dual nationality of overseas Chinese based on its foreign policy of equality, mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, so as to enhance friendly relations with the countries concerned. At the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, Premier Zhou Enlai formally proposed in his government work report that our country was prepared to first resolve this issue with Southeast Asian countries with which it had established diplomatic relations. Subsequently, the Chinese government and the Indonesian government began negotiations in Beijing; last December, when Burmese Prime Minister U Nu visited our country, it was also mentioned in the joint communiqué of the talks between the Chinese and Burmese prime ministers that: "Regarding the nationality issue of overseas residents, the two governments will, at the earliest possible opportunity, conduct consultations through normal diplomatic channels." All of this fully demonstrates the determination and sincerity of the People's Republic of China to solve this problem.

    The Treaty on the Question of Dual Nationality is a good example of solving difficult problems between countries in a spirit of friendly consultation. It has not only won the warm support of the Chinese and Indonesian people, but has also aroused the welcome and attention of all upright international public opinion. Many Indonesian people believe that the impact of this treaty will extend far beyond the scope of the two contracting states.

    The basic spirit貫穿着 "Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on the Question of Dual Nationality" is the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. For overseas Chinese, they can, based on the principle of voluntariness and based on their own circumstances, make their own choice regarding the nationality of the People's Republic of China or the Republic of Indonesia. That is why the overseas Chinese in Indonesia all feel that this treaty is reasonable and correct. From this treaty, our compatriots have experienced the motherland's concern for them.

    After the successful conclusion of the Asian-African Conference, Zhou Enlai, head of the Chinese delegation, spoke separately in Bandung and Jakarta to representatives of overseas Chinese from all regions of Indonesia who came to welcome the Chinese delegation, elaborating on the great significance of signing the Treaty on the Question of Dual Nationality. In particular, Premier Zhou made a clear explanation on the point of voluntarily choosing nationality. The general spirit is: the people of the People's Republic of China will never discriminate against overseas Chinese who have chosen Indonesian nationality; those who have chosen Chinese nationality should not be dissatisfied with those who have chosen Indonesian nationality. Perhaps there are two choices in one family, this is individual freedom, and there is no question of good or bad in this choice. If you choose Indonesian nationality, you can only become friends with Chinese overseas, but you cannot participate in the activities of overseas Chinese organizations. At the same time, those who choose Chinese nationality should not participate in Indonesian political activities. These are all boundaries that must be clearly distinguished. Premier Zhou repeatedly emphasized in his speech: The higher the international status of the motherland, the more modest our overseas compatriots should be towards the local people....

    Throughout the Asian-African Conference, I met the representatives of overseas Chinese who flocked to Bandung and Jakarta from all over Indonesia, and felt their concern for the Asian-African Conference. They loved the motherland and assisted the motherland's delegation in every possible way, which deeply moved me. In an editorial welcoming Premier Zhou's visit to Jakarta, the Jakarta overseas Chinese newspaper "Life" enthusiastically praised the achievements of the Asian-African Conference, supported the "Treaty on the Question of Dual Nationality," and stated: Patriotic Indonesian overseas Chinese will "strengthen the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese, promote the traditional spirit of mutual assistance and mutual aid of overseas Chinese, run well the social welfare and cultural undertakings of overseas Chinese, respect the laws and social customs of the country of residence, Indonesia, and strive to enhance friendly cooperation with the Indonesian people!" Another Jakarta overseas Chinese newspaper, "Sin Po," also said in an editorial entitled "Congratulations on the Signing of the Sino-Indonesian Nationality Agreement": "Standing on the position of overseas Chinese, we sincerely congratulate the solution of this major issue between China and Indonesia, and hope that Sino-Indonesian friendship will grow stronger and jointly strive to maintain peace in Asia and the world!"

### 一个历史问题合理解决了

　　一个历史问题合理解决了
　　本报记者　吴文焘
    四月二十二日的早晨，当亚非会议的分组讨论还没有开始的时候，平日庄严肃穆的万隆西爪哇省公署的门前，一时车水马龙，群众云集。中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国间关于双重国籍问题条约的签字仪式，就在这里举行了。
    签字仪式，包括周恩来总理兼外长和苏纳约外长的讲话，虽然只用了二十分钟，但每个参加者都感到这是一个有历史意义的事件——一个历史问题合理地解决了。特别是这个条约签订在亚非会议期间，更使人们的印象格外深刻。因为，就在亚非会议的头两天里，有人还把华侨的双重国籍问题作为扰乱会议的资料呢。
    的确，存在于中国和东南亚各国间的关于华侨的双重国籍问题，是一个历史上长久遗留下来的问题。就印度尼西亚来说，很多华侨在过去一面是荷印籍民，同时又是中国籍民。经验证明，华侨双重国籍的存在无利于华侨，无利于印度尼西亚人民，无利于华侨和印度尼西亚人民的友好关系，却有利于殖民主义者在华侨与当地人民间实行挑拨离间、“分而治之”的政策。
    今天，情况已经不同了。东南亚独立了的国家希望解决这个问题，中华人民共和国也希望本着它平等互利、和平共处的外交政策来合理地结束华侨双重国籍的现象，以增进对有关国家的友好关系。在中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上，周恩来总理在他所作的政府工作报告中就正式提出我国准备首先同已经建交的东南亚国家解决这个问题。接着，我国政府和印度尼西亚共和国政府就开始在北京进行谈判；去年十二月间缅甸总理吴努来我国访问时，在中、缅两国总理的会谈公报中也讲到：“关于侨民的国籍问题，两国政府将在尽可能早的时机，经过正常外交途径，进行商谈。”这都充分表明中华人民共和国解决这一问题的决心和诚意。
    关于双重国籍问题的条约是国与国之间以友好协商精神解决繁难问题的良好范例。它不仅博得了中国和印度尼西亚人民的热烈支持，并且引起了国际上一切正直的舆论的欢迎和重视。很多印度尼西亚人士认为，这个条约的影响将远超过两缔约国范围以外的。
    贯穿着“中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国关于双重国籍问题的条约”的基本精神，是互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的原则。对于华侨来说，他们可以根据自愿的原则、基于本身的情况而作出自己对于中华人民共和国或印度尼西亚共和国国籍的选择。这就是为什么在印度尼西亚的华侨都感到这个条约是合理和正确的。从这个条约里，我们的侨胞体会到祖国对他们的关怀。
    在亚非会议胜利闭幕之后，中国代表团团长周恩来总理曾分别在万隆和雅加达向从全印度尼西亚各地区来欢迎中国代表团的华侨代表们讲话，阐述关于签订双重国籍问题条约的重大意义。特别是对于自愿选择国籍这一点，周总理更作了明确的说明。总的精神，就是：凡选择了印度尼西亚国籍的华侨，中华人民共和国的人民决不予以歧视；选择了中国国籍的人，也不应该对选择了印度尼西亚国籍的人不满。也许一个家里有两种选择，这是个人的自由，而且这个选择中不存在好与不好的问题。如果选择了印度尼西亚国籍，就只能与中国侨民成为朋友，而不能参加华侨团体的活动。同时，选择了中国国籍的，就不应该参加印度尼西亚的政治活动。这都是必须分清的界限。周总理在讲话中一再强调：祖国的国际地位越高，我们的侨胞就应该对于当地人民越谦虚……。
    在整个亚非会议期间，我会到过从印度尼西亚各地涌到万隆和雅加达来的侨胞代表，体会到他们对于亚非会议的关切。他们热爱祖国，无微不至地协助祖国的代表团，使我深受感动。在欢迎周总理访问雅加达的一篇社论里，雅加达的华侨报纸“生活”报热烈赞扬亚非会议的成就，拥护“关于双重国籍问题的条约”，并表示：爱国的印度尼西亚华侨将“为加强华侨的爱国团结，发扬华侨传统的互助互济精神，办好华侨的社会福利事业和文化事业，尊重侨居国印度尼西亚的法律和社会习惯，为增进与印度尼西亚人民的友好合作而努力！”另一个雅加达的华侨报纸“新报”也在“祝贺中印国籍协定的签订”的社论里说：“我们站在华侨立场，衷心祝贺中印间这一个重大问题的获致解决，并愿中印友谊日益增进，共同为维持亚洲及世界和平而努力！”
