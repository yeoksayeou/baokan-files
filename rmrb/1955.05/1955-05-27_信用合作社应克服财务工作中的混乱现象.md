　　Credit Cooperatives Should Overcome Financial Chaos
　　Wang Jinnong
    A thorough rectification of financial work is a pressing issue that needs to be resolved in the current business operations of credit cooperatives. According to investigation materials from fifty-two counties, among the three thousand and eighty-five credit cooperatives, one-third of them have experienced relatively serious incidents of incorrect accounts and funds. This not only directly hinders the credit cooperatives from carrying out deposit and loan business, but also creates a very bad impact among the masses.
    The most important and basic condition for managing finances is to have a ledger, but many credit cooperatives have not achieved this or simply do not value it. For example, some credit cooperatives have been established for several months or even more than a year without establishing ledgers, and mostly rely on "remembering in the heart" or "belly accounts." Some credit cooperative accountants casually record accounts on the wall, cigarette boxes, or even on their arms for "convenience," resulting in a pile of money and a pile of accounts, with cash and accounts completely unable to match. With such practices, how can the financial work of credit cooperatives not be chaotic? A credit cooperative in Huixian County, Henan Province, provided loans to farmers without establishing contracts or keeping accounts, relying on the borrowers' "conscience." When settling accounts, they found the problem was serious and had to spend a lot of effort to check with each household, but still found a shortage of eighty yuan in cash. Another example is a credit cooperative in Shishou County, Hubei Province, where the accounts were recorded very chaotically. The masses satirized the financial work of this credit cooperative as "four-in-one." What is "four-in-one"? It turns out that this credit cooperative "combined" the loans entrusted by the bank, the dike repair funds entrusted by the government, the relief funds, and the credit cooperative's own share capital into "one," unable to distinguish which item belonged to which party!
    Facts have proven that where the financial work of credit cooperatives is chaotic, embezzlement and waste will occur. According to a survey of one thousand and seventy-one credit cooperatives, nearly one-quarter of the staff members have embezzled or misappropriated the funds of the credit cooperatives. They have various methods of embezzlement, but mostly because there are loopholes to exploit in the financial work. They start by wanting to take some small advantages, but because the financial system is unsound, it is not easy to detect some embezzlement, so they become bolder and bolder, and the amount of embezzlement also increases.
    The result of the chaotic financial work of credit cooperatives inevitably affects the normal development of deposit and loan business. The Yangji Credit Cooperative in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, had to suspend business for sixteen days to rectify its accounts because it had not kept accounts for a long time. The members of the cooperative were very dissatisfied and called this credit cooperative a "closed-door cooperative." The phenomenon of losses caused by chaotic financial work is also serious. For example, many credit cooperatives experienced different degrees of losses in the year-end settlement in 1954. The vast number of farmer members are most practical. They enthusiastically participate in credit cooperatives and actively invest and deposit, hoping that credit cooperatives can help them solve the difficulties in production and life. However, as a result, the business of credit cooperatives has not only failed to develop well, but has instead suffered losses. This cannot but make the members of the cooperative doubt the credit cooperative, and some members are therefore unwilling to continue to invest and deposit in the credit cooperative.
    In order to consolidate credit cooperatives, promote the normal development of deposit and loan business, better help farmers solve the difficulties in production and life, and further combat usury exploitation, credit cooperatives must currently conduct a thorough rectification of the internal financial work. First of all, they must establish ledgers and adhere to the accounting system. Failure to establish ledgers cannot overcome financial chaos, and establishing ledgers without adhering to the accounting system also cannot overcome financial chaos. Establishing ledgers and adhering to the accounting system are indispensable means for credit cooperatives to carry out deposit and loan business. Many members call the accounts of credit cooperatives the "roots," saying that "if the roots are bad, things will go wrong, and if the roots are not bad, loans will not be lost." This is enough to illustrate the important role of credit cooperatives in doing a good job in accounting. Of course, establishing ledgers does not necessarily require establishing new-style accounts. As long as Chinese-style accounts that can distinguish between income and expenditure are established, that is sufficient. In the past, some credit cooperatives, regardless of specific conditions, mechanically copied and applied complex new-style accounts, which not only increased the burden of accounting, but also made it inconvenient for members to conduct inspections.
    For those cooperatives with more problems in finance, the problems in accounts, funds, and business activities should be laid out from the inside out, and then consider taking measures to deal with the problems and improve the work according to their nature. However, the rectification work should be combined with the current deposit and loan business of the credit cooperative. This not only avoids delaying daily work, but also can use business activities and close contact with cooperative members to make the rectification work more thorough and meticulous. At the same time, the relevant departments must also strengthen the ideological education of the staff of credit cooperatives, so that they can draw a clear line between socialism and capitalism in their understanding, and explain to them that embezzlement is a shameful and illegal act, in order to improve their political awareness. In addition, attention should also be paid to mobilizing the masses to launch unremitting struggles against embezzlement and waste, so that the work of the staff within the cooperative is constantly under the supervision of the masses. In order to make financial management sound and consolidated, credit cooperatives must also, in the process of carrying out business, combine practical experience and, through democratic discussion, formulate some simple and feasible financial systems, such as publishing accounts on a regular basis, stipulating approval procedures for large expenditures, and loan review and approval authority. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen capital management, prevent stockpiling and waste, and save expenses. Payments by credit cooperatives should have formal vouchers and go through certain approval procedures, and no one should be allowed to misuse them without authorization. Staff members within the cooperative who receive share capital, deposits, or recover loans must go through account transfer procedures at any time and should not delay submission.

　　信用合作社应克服财务工作中的混乱现象
　　王金农
    切实整顿财务工作，是信用合作社当前开展业务中急待解决的一个问题。根据五十二个县的调查材料，在三千零八十五个信用合作社当中，就有三分之一的社发生了较为严重的错帐错款现象。这不仅直接妨碍了信用社开展存、放款业务，而且在群众中也造成了很坏的影响。
    管理财务最要紧的也是最起码的条件，就是要有一本帐簿，但是却有不少的信用社没有做到或是根本不重视这一点。例如有些信用合作社成立了几个月甚至一年多，还没有建立帐簿，而多是用“凭心记”，或是“肚皮帐”。有些信用社的会计把帐随便记在墙上、烟盒上，甚至为了“方便”就记在胳膊上，结果是钱一堆，帐一堆，现金和帐根本就无法对拢。像这样的做法，信用社的财务工作怎麽能不乱呢？河南辉县一个信用社给农民放款，既不立契约，也不记帐，让贷户“凭良心”，到结算时发现问题严重，只得费很大劲儿去挨户查对，结果还是短少了八十元的现金。又如湖北石首县有一个信用社的帐记得非常混乱，群众讽刺这个信用社的财务工作叫做“四合一”。什么叫做“四合一”呢？原来这个信用社把银行委托发放的贷款、政府委托发放的修堤款、救济款和信用社本身的股金都“合”而为“一”，分不清哪项是哪家的了！
    事实证明，哪些信用社的财务工作混乱，哪些信用社就会发生贪污、浪费等现象。根据对一千零七十一个信用社的调查，有将近四分之一的信用社的工作人员有贪污挪用信用社资金的行为。他们贪污的方法是各种各样的，但多是因为财务工作上有空子可钻。他们开始是想占些便宜，但由于财务制度不健全，贪污一些也不容易发现，于是他们就越来越大胆，贪污的数量也越来越多了。
    信用社财务工作混乱的结果就不能不影响存、放款业务的正常开展。福建仙游县洋极信用社因为好久没有记帐，为了整顿帐目不得不停业十六天，社员群众很不满意，他们把这个信用社叫做“关门社”。因财务工作混乱造成信用社亏损现象也是严重的。例如，有不少的信用合作社在一九五四年年终结算时都发生了程度不同的亏损。广大农民社员是最讲求实际的，他们热情地参加信用合作社，并积极入股存款，原是希望信用社能够帮助他们解决生产、生活中的困难，但是，结果信用社的业务不但没有很好地开展起来，反倒有了亏损，这就不能不使社员群众对信用社发生怀疑，有些社员因此不愿在信用社继续入股和存款了。
    为着信用社的巩固和存、放款业务的正常开展，更好地帮助农民解决生产、生活上的困难问题，并进一步打击高利贷剥削，当前信用社必须认真地对社内的财务工作做一番整顿，首先必须把帐簿建立起来，并坚持记帐制度。不建立帐簿不能克服财务混乱现象，建立了帐簿而不坚持记帐制度同样不能克服财务混乱现象。建立帐簿和坚持记帐制度是信用社开展存、放款业务必不可少的手段。很多社员都称信用社的帐是“根子”，说“根子坏了就要坏事，根子不坏就丢不了款”，这足以说明信用社必须搞好帐务的重要作用了。当然，建立帐簿并不一定要建立新式帐，只要建立能分清收支的中式帐就可以。过去有些信用社不顾具体条件，生搬硬套，勉强采用复杂的新式帐，结果不但增加记帐负担，同时也不便于社员进行检查。
    对于在财务上问题较多的社，应该由内而外，把帐务、款项和业务活动中的问题都摆出来，然后按性质分别考虑采取处理问题和改善工作的办法。但整顿工作应该同信用社当前存、放款业务结合起来进行。这样做既可不误日常工作，又能借助业务活动，通过同社员群众的密切联系，把整顿工作做得更加深入细致。同时，有关部门还必须加强对信用社工作人员的思想教育工作，使他们从认识上划清社会主义和资本主义的思想界限，向他们讲清楚贪污是可耻的、犯法的行为，以便提高他们的政治觉悟。另外还应注意发动群众同贪污、浪费现象展开不懈的斗争，使社内工作人员的工作经常处在群众监督之下。为了使财务管理达到健全和巩固，信用社还必须在开展业务过程中，结合实际经验，通过民主讨论，订立一些简单可行的财务制度，如按期公布帐目、规定大宗款项开支批准手续以及放款审核权限等等。同时也还要加强资金管理，防止积压浪费，节约开支。信用社付款，应有正式凭据并经过一定批准手续，任何人不能擅自乱用。社内工作人员经收股金、存款或收回贷款，须随时办理交帐手续，不应拖延迟交。
