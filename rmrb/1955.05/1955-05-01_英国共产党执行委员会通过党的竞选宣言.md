Xinhua News Agency, London, 28th. TASS reports: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party held a meeting in London on the 26th to discuss the upcoming parliamentary elections. Attending the meeting were the secretaries of regional party organizations and other important party workers.
    According to newspaper reports, the meeting unanimously passed the Party's election manifesto, which put forward the following demands: to ban hydrogen weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction, to stop arming Germany, to universally reduce armaments, to admit China into the United Nations, and to stop colonial wars. In domestic affairs, the manifesto's demands include: raising wages, pensions, and social insurance benefits to improve people's living conditions, increasing appropriations for education and health, reducing rents, and increasing housing construction. The manifesto demands that all basic industrial sectors, banks, insurance companies, and land be taken from the hands of monopoly capitalists and used for the benefit of the people. The manifesto also demands the elimination of all obstacles to trade between East and West.
    The Vice-Chairman of the British Communist Party Executive Committee, Dutt, emphasized at the meeting that the basic content of the election campaign should be the struggle for peace.
    John Gollan, who spoke next, pointed out that on all major issues, there is no essential difference between the policies of the Conservative Party and those of the right-wing Labour Party leaders. However, the situation is quite the opposite in the trade unions and lower-level Labour Party organizations, which are demanding a resolute struggle against the Conservative Party's policies, against the rearmament of West Germany, against the atomic arms race, and for peace and social progress.

    英国共产党执行委员会副主席杜德在会议上强调指出：竞选运动的基本内容应该是为和平而斗争。
    接着发言的约翰·高兰指出：在一切重大问题上，保守党的政策和右翼工党领袖的政策都没有本质的差别。但是，在工会和工党下层组织中，情形却恰恰相反，它们都要求为反对保守党的政策、反对重新武装西德、反对原子军备竞赛、争取和平和社会进步而坚决斗争。
