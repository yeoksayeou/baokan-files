　　The Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Culture
　　Announce Regulations for Enrollment in Higher Music, Art, and Drama Schools
　　On the 21st, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Culture jointly issued regulations regarding the nationwide enrollment of new students in higher music, art, and drama schools for the summer of 1955.
　　In order to ensure the quality of incoming students and better cater to the aspirations of candidates, this year, the enrollment work for national higher music, art, and drama schools will be changed to a system of independent enrollment by each school (art schools of the same nature can organize joint enrollment in the same region). Each higher music, art, and drama school will also establish a pre-application system, stipulating that the period from May 25th to June 25th will be the date for each school to receive application forms mailed by prospective students. After each school receives the application forms and relevant documents and works mailed by prospective students, it will notify the applicants of the review results in batches before June 30th, specifying the date, time, and location of the examination. The examination dates are set from July 6th to 20th, to be determined by each school.
　　The regulations specify the application requirements: students who have graduated from high school or have equivalent qualifications; citizens of the People's Republic of China aged seventeen to twenty-seven may apply. The admission age for cadres on the job, demobilized and transferred soldiers, industrial workers, farmers, folk artists, and young people from ethnic minorities can be relaxed to under thirty years old. Examination subjects: In addition to testing general courses such as political common sense, native language, history, and geography, all departments of higher music, drama, and art schools must test relevant professional art courses. Students applying to higher music, art, and drama schools must first take the professional course examination for the department they are applying for, and those who fail the professional course examination will not be allowed to take the general course examination. Graduates of Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle Schools, cadres on the job, demobilized and transferred soldiers, industrial workers, farmers, folk artists, and young people from ethnic minorities who have promising artistic development will be given priority for admission.
　　Higher music school enrollment locations: Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Nanning, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guiyang, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Taiyuan, Kaifeng. Higher art school enrollment locations: Beijing, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, Changsha, Guangzhou, Shantou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Taiyuan, Kaifeng.
