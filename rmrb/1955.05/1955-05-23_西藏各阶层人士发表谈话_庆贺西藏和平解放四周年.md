Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 22nd: On the eve of the fourth anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, people from all walks of life in Lhasa issued statements celebrating the achievements made in the past four years in implementing the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." Gaga Zhang Losang Rinzin, Acting Kalon of the Tibetan local government, said: In the past few years, the People's Liberation Army and staff stationed in Tibet have correctly implemented the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policies and the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," and have enthusiastically helped the Tibetan people in construction. New relationships of friendship, unity, mutual trust have been established between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within the Tibetan nationality. Based on this, the Tibetan people have had the great joy of the Dalai Lama, Panchen Erdeni, and others attending the First Session of the First National People's Congress, and the full opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways. In March of this year, the State Council also approved various decisions such as the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and assistance to Tibet in construction matters, which fully conforms to the interests and aspirations of our Tibetan people. I was particularly happy when I saw the Tibetan engineering survey team starting work in Lhasa. Since the Central People's Government has uniformly handled all foreign affairs in the Tibet region, China and India have signed the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India." This not only fully meets the interests of the Tibetan people, but also promotes the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indian people to a new level.
	Dele Raodeng, Deputy Director of the Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall Committee, said: Over the past four years, whenever farmers in the Rikaze area lacked seeds or handicraftsmen lacked capital, the Central People's Government has issued loans to solve the difficulties in people's production. Especially after the floods last year, the State Council promptly allocated funds and grain for relief. The production and life of the disaster victims have been guaranteed. The State Council has also decided to help the Tibetan people build highways from Lhasa to Rikaze and from Rikaze to Gyantse, which has made the monks and laypeople even more jubilant. We are very moved by the help and care that the motherland family has given to the Tibetan people. Laga Li Langji Jia Cuo, deputy head of the Tibetan delegation that had just returned from visiting the motherland, said: With the rapid advancement of socialist construction in the motherland, new changes have also taken place on the Kangzang Plateau. On our way back to Tibet this time, we saw many new villages and towns appearing on both sides of the flat highway. As soon as we arrived in Lhasa, we saw the Lhasa River Bridge, and we felt extremely happy and excited.
	Lobsang Danzeng, a lama from Lhasa's Gongdelin Monastery, and Duwa Kanbu from Zhebeng Monastery, said: The People's Liberation Army and staff stationed in Tibet faithfully implemented the policy of respecting freedom of religious belief and protecting temples. The Tibetan religious community also sent representatives to attend the founding meeting of the Buddhist Association of China. Gui Xiangba Gongga Angjie, a Tibetan businessman, said: The opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways has begun to bring prosperity to the economy of the Tibetan region. Now, daily necessities such as tea needed by the Tibetan people are continuously transported to Tibet, and state-owned trading companies also wholesale these goods to Tibetan merchants. Tibetan specialties such as wool, leather, and medicinal materials have found sales channels, which have begun to increase prices. Huo Kang Sonam Banba, head of the Social Education Class of the Cadre School of the Tibet Military Region, said: In the past few years, primary schools have been established in major towns in Tibet, and thousands of Tibetan children and young people have been able to enroll in school. The young people studying in the Social Education Class can now understand Tibetan newspapers, and some can write articles and poems in Tibetan. This year, we have more than 160 students, about twice as many as last year. In addition to young people from Lhasa, there are also young men and women from Shannan District, Gongbu District, as well as from Yangzhuoyong Lake and the northern Tibetan grasslands.

　　西藏各阶层人士发表谈话
　　庆贺西藏和平解放四周年
    新华社拉萨二十二日电　西藏和平解放四周年前夕，拉萨各界人士发表谈话，庆贺四年来在执行
  “和平解放西藏办法的协议”中获得的成就。西藏地方政府代理噶伦噶章·罗桑仁增说：几年来，进藏人民解放军和工作人员正确地执行了中国共产党的民族政策和“和平解放西藏办法的协议”，热情的帮助西藏人民进行建设。汉、藏民族和西藏民族内部建立了新的友爱团结、互相信任的关系。在这个基础上，西藏人民有了达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼等出席第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议和康藏、青藏公路全线通车的大喜事。今年三月，国务院又通过了关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会和关于帮助西藏地方进行建设事项等各项决定，这完全符合我们藏族人民的利益和愿望。当我看到西藏工程勘察队在拉萨展开工作时，感到特别高兴。中央人民政府统一处理西藏地区一切涉外事宜以来，中印两国签订了“中华人民共和国、印度共和国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定”。这不仅完全符合西藏人民的利益，而且使中印两国人民的友好关系有了新的发展。
    班禅堪布会议厅委员会副主任德勒饶登说：四年来，每当日喀则地区农民们缺乏种籽，手工业者缺乏资本的时候，中央人民政府都发放贷款，解决了人民生产中的困难。特别是去年遭受水灾后，国务院及时拨款拨粮救济。灾民的生产、生活得到了保障。国务院又决定帮助西藏人民修通拉萨到日喀则和日喀则到江孜的公路，僧俗人民更加欢欣鼓舞。祖国大家庭给予藏族人民的帮助和爱护使我们很感动。刚从祖国内地回来的西藏参观团副团长拉加利·朗吉嘉措说：随着祖国社会主义建设的突飞猛进，康藏高原上也有了新的变化。这次我们返藏途中，看到了在平坦的公路两旁，出现了许多新的村镇。一到拉萨，又看到了拉萨河大桥，我们感到无比的高兴和兴奋。
    拉萨功德林的喇嘛洛桑丹增和哲蚌寺的都瓦堪布说：进藏人民解放军和工作人员忠实执行了尊重宗教信仰自由、保护寺庙的政策。西藏宗教界还派代表出席了中国佛教协会成立会议。藏族商业人士桂香巴·贡噶昂杰说：康藏、青藏公路通车，开始给西藏地区的经济带来了繁荣。现在藏族人民需要的茶叶等日用品源源运来西藏，国营贸易公司还把这些货物批发给藏族商人。西藏地区出产的羊毛、皮张、药材等土产，有了销路，开始提高了价格。西藏军区干部学校社会教育班主任霍康·索南班巴说：几年来西藏各主要城镇都成立了小学，成千上百的藏族儿童和青年能入校学习。在社会教育班学习的青年，已能看懂藏文报纸，有的已会用藏文写文章和诗歌。今年我们已有学员一百六十多人，比去年增加了约一倍。其中除拉萨青年外，还有从山南区、工布区以及从羊卓雍湖和藏北草原上来学习的男女青年。
