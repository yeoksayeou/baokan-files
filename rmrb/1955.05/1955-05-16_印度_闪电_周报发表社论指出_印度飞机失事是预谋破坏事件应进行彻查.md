Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 15th. The editor of the "Blitz" weekly, R.K. Karanjia, wrote in an editorial titled "Air Murder" on the front page of the "Blitz" weekly on the 14th: New facts and reports about the "Kashmir Princess" crash received from reporters in Hong Kong, Jakarta, and Singapore, as well as former Royal Air Force pilots, "leave no doubt that the plane was sabotaged." The editorial pointed out that the evidence before the investigation committee proves absolutely and indisputably that this was a pre-planned and pre-organized act of sabotage. The editorial said: "The time bomb was placed behind the fuel tank on the right wing, where there was no fire extinguishing equipment, because there was no possibility of fire in this place."
　　The editorial said that it is clear that the time bomb was placed while the plane was in Hong Kong. No special security measures were taken in Hong Kong. No extra police were seen around the airport. It also pointed out that when the plane landed in Hong Kong for refueling, the bags of the two mechanics, Karnik and De Cunha, who were responsible for routine intermediate checks and refueling, were mysteriously removed from the plane.
　　The editorial expressed concern about the condition of the plane's right wing. The editorial said, "People will recall that news from Singapore on April 14 announced that the right wing of the plane was severely damaged when it was found on the seabed." The editorial called for further investigation into the sabotage of the "Kashmir Princess."

　　印度“闪电”周报发表社论指出
　　印度飞机失事是预谋破坏事件应进行彻查
    新华社新德里十五日电  “闪电”周报主编卡朗吉亚十四日在“闪电”周报第一版的题为“空中谋杀”的社论中写道：从香港、雅加达和新加坡的记者以及前皇家空军驾驶员那里得到的关于“克什米尔公主号”失事的新的事实和报道，“使人毫不怀疑这架飞机是被破坏的”。社论指出，摆在调查委员会面前的证据绝对不容置辩地证明这是一个预先计划和预先组织的破坏事件，社论说：“定时炸弹是放在右翼后边的油箱后面，那里没有灭火设备，因为这个地方不可能起火。”
    社论说，很明显，定时炸弹是飞机在香港停留时被置放的。在香港并没有采取特殊的安全措施。在飞机场的周围没有看到额外的警察。还指出，当飞机在香港着陆加油时，两个负责例行的中途检查和加油工作的机械师卡尼克和德库纳的皮包被神秘地从机上取走了。
    社论对于飞机右翼的情况表示关切。社论说，“人们将会想起：四月十四日自新加坡来的消息宣布，飞机的右翼在海底发现时毁损的情况严重。”社论要求对“克什米尔公主号”的破坏事件进行进一步的调查。
