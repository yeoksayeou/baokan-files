　　Opposing Colonialism with Internationalism
　　Di Chaobai
    I. Capitalism and colonialism are inseparable.
    Colonialism did not originate in modern times. As early as the end of the fifteenth century, those pioneers of Western European capitalism—overseas merchants—took goods and ships to Africa, the Near East, and later the Americas to develop their commodity markets. These trades also promoted mutual contact between different parts of the world; however, this contact began unfairly. Military oppression, political deception, and economic plunder were combined to gradually turn economically backward countries into colonies. Through unequal exchange, slave trade, tributes, and war looting, the wealth of the colonies was continuously transported to advanced Western European countries, becoming an important source of primitive accumulation for the development of capitalist economies, and the material conditions that promoted the British Industrial Revolution. From the seventeenth to the mid-nineteenth century, it was the era of industrial capitalism. The ideas of freedom, democracy, equality, and fraternity, which sprouted in Britain and were promoted by French Enlightenment scholars, once generated fanatical intoxication among the bourgeoisie, petty bourgeoisie, and working people of various countries; and led to the American independence movement, the French Revolution, and bourgeois revolutions in other countries. However, these brilliant bourgeois liberal ideas were not allowed to be enjoyed by the people of the colonies. Even the British who fled Britain and arrived in North America were no exception. Therefore, these British people, in indignation, rose up against British colonialism, unscrupulously propagating the ideas of freedom and democracy in North America, and taking up arms. Under the leadership of great bourgeois democrats such as Washington and Jefferson, they fought the British for seven years, writing the concepts of freedom, equality, and the inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the Declaration of Independence, and later in the American Constitution. Now we should say something fair: the American independence movement at that time was not organized and instigated by Enlightenment scholars from Britain and France, nor should the actions of great figures such as Washington and Jefferson be described as being directed by foreigners; but it should be said that this was a natural result of the colonial rule of the British aristocratic landlords and the awakening of the American people. Unfortunately, the rulers of these advanced capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France did not learn from their own experiences, and they continued to promote colonialism in the same way and with increasing intensity. By the end of the nineteenth century, they had almost divided up the world. They gradually turned the inspiring ideological appeals put forward during the era of democratic revolution into historical archives, and making aggressive wars and the rule and plunder of colonies the main purpose of their national activities. We should also say something fair: this is not because the rulers of these countries lacked historical knowledge, nor did they change their minds and go back to admiring rulers such as Charles I, George III, and Louis XVI, but because the development of monopoly capitalism, for the benefit of monopoly capital, required the dumping of finished products, the monopolization of raw materials, and the export of capital to colonies and dependent countries. In order to escape the periodic economic crises that haunted them like demons, they adopted various infiltration methods, even constantly stirring up wars to re-divide the colonies. These were all determined by the nature of the capitalist system. For the benefit of capitalists and monopoly capital groups, they had to abandon the lofty ideas and painful historical lessons of their ancestors. It was only during the two world wars that, in order to mobilize the people against German militarism and fascism, the leaders of the United States, Britain, and France had to take out the banner of "freedom and democracy" from the archives again and rely on it to achieve victory. However, when they were excitedly distributing the spoils plundered from the defeated countries, and when they turned around to suppress the independence movements of the awakened colonial people, they quickly stuffed the banner of "freedom and democracy" back into the archives. It should be said fairly that this was not because Hitler and Mussolini's remnants of the Fifth Column had infiltrated the governments of these countries again, nor was it because they did not understand that the hatred of the people of the colonies and dependent countries towards them was the result of the implementation of colonial policies, but because the interests of monopoly capital groups were irreconcilable with the interests of the broad masses of people in the colonies and dependent countries, and the nature of imperialism made them perfidiously engage in all kinds of evil deeds. They also understood that colonialism would inevitably arouse resistance from the colonial people. Therefore, the militarization of the national economy, the establishment of military bases around the world under the pretext of anti-communism, and the stationing of naval, land, and air forces to maintain a constant state of tension became inevitable steps to maintain the monopoly capitalist system and carry out expansionist policies.
　  II. Characteristics of American Monopoly Capital and Its Colonialism
    The development of American capitalism was later than that of Britain and France. When it entered the stage of imperialism, except for South America, the colonies and spheres of influence in the rest of the world had almost been divided up. Therefore, in 1899, it put forward the demand for "open door, equal opportunity" to redistribute the colonies, gradually turning the countries of South America into dependent countries, and then turned to Asia.
    American monopoly capitalism developed rapidly during the two world wars. In the First World War, the U.S. general production index increased by a quarter, and commodity exports increased from 2.3 billion yuan in 1914 to 8 billion yuan in 1920. From a debtor country, it became a creditor country, gradually squeezing into Britain's position. In the Second World War, the United States achieved even faster and greater development. The general index of industrial production in 1946 increased by more than 50% compared to 1937, and commodity exports increased from 3.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1937 to 9.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1946. Overseas investment increased from 12.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1936 to more than 30 billion U.S. dollars in 1946. This created the dominance of the United States in the capitalist world. From this, it can be seen that American monopoly capital groups have repeatedly become rich and seized world hegemony by sacrificing the lives of millions of people in world wars; at the same time, rescuing economic crises from wars and expanding through wars has become the law of development of American monopoly capital. Because the industrial expansion caused by the war is mainly the expansion of the military industry, and even more because the basic contradictions of capitalism have widened the gap between production and people's consumption, the immediate way out is to promote greater investment in the military industry sector; therefore, American monopoly capital must constantly maintain a state of tension, constantly try to create an atmosphere of international war, rearm militarists, establish military bases all over the world, station land, sea, and air forces in other countries' territories, force other countries to conclude military alliances, peddle military supplies, etc., step by step leading its allies towards new wars. Under the resolute opposition of peace-loving people all over the world, even if it is not easy or impossible to break out a new world war for a while, American monopoly capital has already achieved the goal of enslaving colonies and dependent countries. It has gradually infiltrated and controlled the politics, military, and economy of these countries. The "cause" of conquering all colonies, which the bourgeoisie of countries such as Britain and France almost completed after two centuries, was "friendly" snatched away by American monopoly capital in about ten years, and now it continues to "friendly" infiltrate and occupy the remaining two-thirds of the region. Due to the strength of peaceful and democratic countries, the colonialism of American monopoly capital groups is carried out under the cover of the Cold War; it is carried out under the bait of foreign aid appropriations and "technical and economic cooperation"; it is carried out under the methods of conspiracy coups, internal unrest, and the establishment of hostile international groups. Now, it can already extract about 7.5 billion U.S. dollars in profits from overseas every year from foreign trade and overseas investment alone. "U.S. aid" is actually a form of promoting U.S. surplus products, and a secret weapon for occupying markets. Many countries have suffered the fate of domestic economic bankruptcy due to accepting "U.S. aid." The purpose of "technical and economic cooperation" is to promote the development of the colonial economic form of the other party. The scope of "technical assistance" is limited to roads, cultivation and processing of raw materials, and exploration of strategic resources, attempting to make these countries suppliers of raw materials and minerals for American monopoly capital and sales sites for American commodities. They strictly restrict the export of machinery and equipment to backward countries, and prohibit or crack down on these countries from building heavy industry. American third-class technicians want to make the countries being "cooperated" pay ten times the salary of the country's first-class technicians. The waste in many designs and constructions is astonishing. If the colonial adventurers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries carried old-fashioned guns to plunder the people in backward areas, then the adventurers of these American monopoly capital often infiltrate the recipient countries with drawings and slide rules, becoming an important factor in the political and economic instability of the recipient countries. There is no essential difference between the colonialism of American monopoly capitalists and the colonialism of their predecessors, and it is still the combination of political and military control and social and economic infiltration. The characteristic of its "democratic life" is only that it does not set up a nominal ruler like an American governor in these affiliated countries, but prefers to have the American ambassador or special envoy perform this task.
　  III. The Awakening of the People of Colonies and Dependent Countries Is An Irresistible Historical Trend
    During the two world wars, the people of colonies and dependent countries actively participated in the struggle against German militarism and against German, Italian, and Japanese fascism. They sincerely shed blood and sacrificed for this noble purpose; therefore, after the victorious end of the war, it was natural for them to demand their own independence and liberation. They were bound to oppose foreign rulers, oppose this barbaric and selfish oppression and exploitation of colonialism, and oppose the instigators and makers of aggressive wars. The speeches and actions that arise from these just demands are bound to win the sympathy and support of all good people at home and abroad. Only the monopoly capital groups and their agents of those "suzerain states" turn around to antagonize and suppress the anti-colonial struggle of the people, using all means to undermine this national independence movement, arresting and massacring everywhere, and slandering this movement as being "infiltrated by foreign countries." They seem to have forgotten the conditions under which their own historical democratic revolutionary movements and national independence movements arose. In fact, they are much more cruel than the feudal rulers who suppressed the democratic revolution in the past. The large monopoly capitalists sitting in New York, London, and Paris can earn hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars each year, while the vast majority of working people in South Asia and Southeast Asia earn only about twenty U.S. dollars per person per year on average. This distance in living standards is far greater than the distance between slave owners and slaves in the Roman era, and far greater than the distance between feudal lords and serfs in the feudal era. Slave owners and feudal lords had to feed their slaves or serfs while exploiting them, while modern monopoly capitalists, in addition to exploiting the people of colonies and dependent countries, let them "freely" become poor, bankrupt, and starve to death, or launch a war to destroy them on a large scale. Now that nuclear weapons have been invented, they think this work will be easier to do.
    Human thoughts cannot be regulated by national borders and the police. Any progressive thought has a vigorous vitality, and it will naturally spread everywhere without any external instigation (only reactionary and unjust thoughts need external instigation). The doctrines of Jesus were spread in this way, and the liberal and democratic ideas of the bourgeois revolution were also spread in this way. Then, modern national liberation and socialist ideas will undoubtedly be spread in this way. No one has the right to oppose the acceptance of a progressive idea based on the people's self-consciousness, and opposition will not be effective. Progressive ideas and doctrines generated based on new socio-economic conditions are the driving force for the progress of human society, and no force can stop them. Only decaying and declining classes will shout and tremble in front of them.
    We have always maintained that all peoples have the right to choose their own political beliefs and social systems without any external interference. We will neither allow other countries to infringe upon our territorial sovereignty and interfere in our political beliefs, nor will we infringe upon other countries' territorial sovereignty and interfere in their political beliefs. American monopoly capital groups and their governments have consistently traveled thousands of miles to interfere in other countries' internal affairs and political beliefs, forming a semi-encirclement around our country. The first to suffer from its political, economic, and military infiltration are many countries that are forced to be associated with it. We sympathize with the encounters of these countries. We will adhere to the policy of "opposing colonialism, striving for and safeguarding national independence, opposing aggressive wars, and safeguarding world peace," and morally help these countries gradually get rid of foreign rule and exploitation, thereby gaining freedom and happiness. Many Asian countries have the same experiences as we did in the past, and have many commonalities in their socio-economic backgrounds. Therefore, people from all walks of life in these countries are interested in the situation in New China and hope to exchange construction experiences in various fields. This is also very natural and justified.
　  IV. Internationalism of Socialist Countries
    The peaceful and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union has established a socialist system that eliminates exploitation or is transitioning to a socialist system. The facts of the Soviet Union's 37 years of construction have fully demonstrated the superiority of this system. This system is based on the foundation of the working people's equal and mutually cooperative production, and at the same time, the distribution of production relations is based on the principle of distribution according to work. The purpose of production in socialist society is not to obtain profits, but to maximize the satisfaction of the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the entire society; therefore, it does not have the irreconcilable contradiction between production and consumption, no surplus commodities and surplus funds, and no economic crises will occur. All of its production is mainly for direct domestic needs, and equal and mutually beneficial trade with foreign countries is also to meet the needs of domestic production and consumption. This is essentially different from the purpose of production in monopoly capitalism to obtain maximum profits. Under the contrast between these two social systems, it is easy to understand who demands war and who demands peace.
    The people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe established people's democratic systems that transitioned to socialism only after the people of each country won victory through the brutal struggle of the anti-fascist war, and the people took control of their own destiny. The reason why the people of each country chose the socialist system instead of the capitalist system is the same reason why the United States only chose the capitalist democratic system instead of the feudal system after the victory of the independence movement. This is the people's consciousness and the people's common sense. No one wants to throw away the watermelon and pick up the sesame seeds. The people of the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe are building their countries with unprecedentedly high labor enthusiasm and wholeheartedly love their social system. To illustrate with a few simple figures: the industrial development in Czechoslovakia in the ten years since liberation is nearly more than double the level reached in the past one hundred and fifty years, and 97% of cities and villages have been electrified. In the first four years of the Democratic Republic of Germany's first five-year plan (1951-1954), the total value of industrial production increased by 76%, and the output was nearly doubled compared to 1936. During the same period, the funding for culture and science also increased by nearly doubled. In the ten years after liberation, Hungary's total industrial output has increased three times compared to the pre-war period, while Hungary, which was controlled by foreign capital before the war, only increased its total industrial output by 20% in twenty years. In the ten years after liberation, Poland's total industrial output has increased four times compared to the pre-war period, and its steel output is equivalent to that of France. The development situation of other people's democratic countries is also similar. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union has given great assistance to the economic development of these countries. This assistance is entirely based on the spirit of selfless internationalism, helping these countries materially and technically to build independent national economies based on heavy industry, without any political conditions attached. If this situation is compared with the way American monopoly capital treats the countries of Central and South America, then what is colonialism and what is internationalism should be easy to understand for anyone with a little rationality and judgment.
    The policy of the countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union towards backward countries in Asia and Africa is full of moral spirit. The Soviet Union has repeatedly stated its willingness to provide necessary technical and economic assistance according to the requests of various countries. The trade relations between the Soviet Union and the Asian, African, and South American countries that have signed trade agreements with it fully demonstrate that its main purpose is to help these economically backward countries build industries and independent national economies. The monopoly capital groups of the United States, Britain, and France have consistently wanted to prevent and destroy backward countries from building industries, especially heavy industries. They strictly control the export of machinery and equipment and raw materials for heavy industry to these countries. On the contrary, the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries are willing to supply as much as possible all the materials that are beneficial to the economic development of various countries, except for military supplies and weapons. The recent examples of helping India build a metallurgical joint factory with an annual output of one million tons of steel and helping Afghanistan establish industrial and transportation undertakings are all examples of international economic relations embodying the spirit of internationalism. The trade agreements that our country has concluded with many countries also fully implement the spirit of equality and mutual benefit. Although our country is in the industrialization period, we still supply industrial equipment and equipment according to the needs of the other party, and import some products that are suppressed and unsalable at preferential prices by monopoly capital.
    In the current international relations, two main opposing trends are very obvious: colonialism produced by monopoly capitalism and internationalism produced by socialism. The former's policy is a policy of enslaving and exploiting the people of colonies and dependent countries, and is the root cause of international disputes and international wars; the latter's policy is a policy of helping backward countries develop their independent national economies and improve the living standards of their people based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and is a factor in the development of peace and prosperity. All peace-loving and freedom-loving people should uphold and promote internationalism to oppose and eliminate colonialism.

　　以国际主义来反对殖民主义
　　狄超白
    一、资本主义和殖民主义是形影不离的
    殖民主义不是近代产生的，早在十五世纪末叶，那些西欧资本主义的先驱者——海外贸易商人，就带着商品和船舰到非洲、近东以至后来的美洲等地，开拓他们的商品市场。这些贸易也曾经促进了世界各地的相互接触，然而这种接触一开始就是不公道的，军事压迫、政治欺骗和经济掠夺相互结合，把那些经济落后的国家逐步变为殖民地，通过不等价交换、贩卖奴隶、贡赋、战争掠夺等方式把殖民地的财富源源不绝地载运到西欧先进国家，成为资本主义经济发展的原始积累的重要来源，也就是促成英国产业革命的物资条件。自十七世纪至十九世纪中叶，是工业资本主义的时期，自英国萌芽而由法国的启蒙学者所发扬的自由、民主、平等、博爱底思想，曾经在各国资产阶级、小资产阶级和劳动人民中间产生了狂热的陶醉作用；并且导致了美国独立运动、法国大革命和其它各国的资产阶级革命。然而这种光辉的资产阶级自由思想，却是不允许殖民地人民享受的。从英国流亡出来到达北美的英国人也不能例外。所以这些英国人在愤激之下就起来反对英国的殖民主义，把自由、民主的思想在北美肆无忌惮地宣传起来，并且拿起枪杆，在华盛顿、杰弗逊等伟大的资产阶级民主主义者的领导之下，同英国人打了七年仗，把自由、平等、生存和幸福的人权概念写在独立宣言中，后来又写在美国的宪法里。现在我们应该说一句公平话，当时美国的独立运动并不是英法的启蒙学者派人去组织掀动起来的，更不能把华盛顿、杰弗逊等伟大人物的行动说成是受外国人指使的；而应该说：这是由于英国贵族地主的殖民统治和美国人民醒觉的自然结果。可惜后来美国、英国、法国这些先进资本主义国家的统治者并不记取他们亲身的教训，他们照样地并且日益加强地推行殖民主义。到了十九世纪末叶，他们差不多就把世界分割完了，他们把民主革命时代所提出的激动人心的思想号召日渐变成历史档案，把侵略战争和统治、掠夺殖民地成为他们国家活动的主要目的。我们也应该说一句公道话：这并不是因为这些国家的当政者缺乏历史知识，也不是他们又回心转意去推崇查理一世、乔治三世、路易十六等类的统治人物，而是因为垄断资本主义的发展，为了垄断资本的利益，就要向殖民地和附属国倾销成品、垄断原料和输出资本。为了逃脱定期出现的魔鬼一样的经济危机，他们就要采取各种各样的渗入手段，以至不断掀起再分割殖民地的战争。这些都是资本主义制度的本质决定的，为了资本家和垄断资本集团的利益，就要抛弃他们祖先的崇高思想和惨痛的历史教训了。只是在两次世界大战期间，为了动员人民反对德国军国主义和法西斯主义，美、英、法的领导者才不得已又从档案中抽出“自由民主”的旗帜，并依靠它取得了胜利。然而当他们兴致勃勃地分配从战败国掠夺来的赃物的时候，当他们回头镇压觉醒了的殖民地人民的独立运动的时候，又赶快把“自由民主”的旗帜塞进档案里去了。应该说句公道话：这并不是因为希特勒、墨索里尼余党第五纵队又渗入了这些国家的政府，也不是他们不懂得殖民地附属国人民对他们的仇恨是由于殖民主义政策推行的结果，而是因为垄断资本集团的利益同殖民地附属国广大人民的利益是不可调和的，帝国主义的本质使他们背信弃义地做着一切罪恶的勾当。他们也懂得：殖民主义一定会激起殖民地人民的反抗，所以国民经济军事化、在反共的借口下在世界各地建立军事基地、驻扎海陆空军以经常保持紧张状态，也就成为保持垄断资本主义制度和进行扩张政策的必然步骤。
　  二、美国垄断资本的特点及其殖民主义
    美国资本主义的发展比英法等国要迟，当它进入帝国主义阶段的时候，除南美洲外，世界其余各地的殖民地和势力范围几乎已瓜分完了，因此便在一八九九年提出“门户开放、机会均等”的要求来再分配殖民地，渐次把南美洲各国变成了附属国，然后转向亚洲。
    美国垄断资本主义是在两次世界大战中迅速发展起来的。在第一次大战中美国生产总指数增加四分之一，商品输出自一九一四年的二十三亿元增加到一九二○年的八十亿元，由一个债务国变成债权国，逐渐挤上英国的地位。在第二次世界大战中，美国获得更快更大的发展，一九四六年的工业生产总指数较之一九三七年增加百分之五十以上，商品输出自一九三七年的三十三亿美元增加到一九四六年的九十七亿美元，海外投资自一九三六年的一百二十四亿美元增加到一九四六年的三百亿美元以上。这就造成美国在资本主义世界的独霸局面。由此可知：美国垄断资本集团是屡靠牺牲千百万人民生命的世界战争发财致富并攫取世界霸权的；同时从战争中挽救经济危机并通过战争进行扩张，成了美国垄断资本的发展规律。由于在战争中造成的工业扩张主要是军需工业的扩张，更由于资本主义基本矛盾所造成的生产同人民消费之间距离愈来愈大，眼前的出路就促成更向军需工业的部门扩大投资；因此美国垄断资本就必须经常保持紧张状态，经常想尽各种办法挑起国际间的战争气氛，重新武装军国主义者，在全世界各地建立军事基地，在他国领土内驻扎陆海空军，强迫其他国家缔结军事同盟，兜销军需品等等，一步一步地把它的胁从国家导向新的战争。在全世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对之下即使一时不易或者不能爆发新的世界战争的情况下，美国垄断资本也已经达到了奴役殖民地和附属国的目的，它已经逐步渗入和控制了这些国家的政治、军事和经济。从前英法等国资产阶级几乎经过两个世纪才完成的征服所有殖民地的“事业”，美国垄断资本只在十年左右的时间就从她们手里“友好地”抢去了三分之一，现在还继续“友好地”渗入和霸占其余的三分之二的地区。由于和平民主国家的强大，美国垄断资本集团的殖民主义是在冷战的掩盖下进行的；是在援外拨款和“技术经济合作”等引饵下进行的；是在阴谋政变、内乱和建立敌对国际集团等方式下进行的。现在它每年单从对外贸易和海外投资二项中就已能从海外剥削得七十五亿美元左右的利润。“美援”实际上是推销美国剩余产品的形式，是霸占市场的秘密武器，许多国家由于接受了“美援”而遭到国内经济破产的命运。“技术经济合作”底目的在促进对方殖民地经济形态的发展。“技术援助”的范围仅限于道路、原料的培植和加工、战略资源的勘探等方面，企图使这些国家成为美国垄断资本的原料矿产的供给者和美国商品的推销地。它们严格限制机器设备向落后国家输出，禁止或打击这些国家建设重工业。美国的三等技术员要使被“合作”的国家支付十倍于该国一等技术人员的薪金。许多设计和施工的浪费是惊人的。假如十六、七世纪的殖民主义冒险家是带着老式枪铳向落后地区的人民施行掠夺的话，现在这些美国垄断资本的冒险家则往往带着图样、计算尺向受援国家渗入，成为受援国家政治经济不稳定的重要因素。美国垄断资本家的殖民主义和他们前辈的殖民主义并没有本质上的区别，同样是政治、军事的控制和社会经济的渗入相互结合。它的“民主生活”的特点仅是不在这些附属国设置一个美国总督之类名义的统治者，而宁可由美国大使或特使等人来执行这个任务。
　  三、殖民地附属国人民的觉醒是不可抑阻的历史趋势
    两次世界大战，殖民地及附属国的人民，都曾积极参加反对德国军国主义和反对德、意、日法西斯主义的斗争。他们衷心地为着这种崇高的目的而流血牺牲；因此，当战争胜利结束以后，他们要求自己的独立解放是很自然的，他们必然要反对外国的统治者，反对这种野蛮和自私的殖民主义的压迫和剥削，反对侵略战争的挑拨者和制造者。基于这些正义的要求而发生的言论和行动，也必然会获得国内外一切善良人们的同情和支持。只有那些“宗主国”的垄断资本集团及其代理人，却是回过头来要敌视和镇压人民的反殖民主义的斗争，用尽一切手段来破坏这种民族的独立运动，到处逮捕和屠杀，并且侮蔑这种运动是由“外国渗入”，他们似乎已经把他们自己历史上的民主革命运动和民族独立运动所由产生的条件忘记掉了。事实上，他们是比旧日镇压民主革命的封建统治者要残忍得多。坐在纽约、伦敦和巴黎的大垄断资本家每人每年收入可达数亿美元，而南亚和东南亚各地的极大多数劳动人民每人每年平均收入仅约二十美元，这种生活水平的距离既远超过罗马时代的奴隶主和奴隶之间的距离，也远超过封建时代封建主和农奴之间的距离。奴隶主和封建主对于他们的奴隶或农奴既要剥削他们也要养活他们，而现代的垄断资本家对于殖民地及附属国人民除剥削他们而外，就让他们“自由地”贫困、破产、饿死，否则就发动一次战争来加以大规模的毁灭，现在发明了核子武器，他们想这个工作就更容易做了。
    人类的思想是不能用国界和警察来加以规范的，任何一种进步思想都具有茁壮的生命力，它会自然地到处传播，不需要任何外力的策动（只有反动的非正义的思想才需要外力策动）。耶稣教义曾经是这样传播的，资产阶级革命的自由民主思想也曾经是这样传播的，那末，现代的民族解放和社会主义思想无疑地也会这样传播。基于人民的自觉而接受一种进步的思想，任何人都没有权利去反对，反对也不会有效果。基于新的社会经济条件而产生的进步的思想学说，是人类社会进步的推动力，任何力量都不能阻止，只有衰朽没落的阶级才会在它面前叫嚷和发抖。
    我们一贯主张各国人民有权选择他们自己的政治信念和社会制度，不受任何外来的干涉。我们既不容许他国来侵犯我国的领土主权和干涉我们的政治信念，我们也决不侵犯他国的领土主权和干涉他国的政治信念。美国垄断资本集团及其政府却一贯地不远千里来干涉他国的内政和政治信念，在我国的周围形成了半包围圈，首先遭到它的政治、经济、军事渗入的是被强迫同它联在一起的许多国家。我们同情这些国家的遭遇，我们将坚持“反对殖民主义，争取和保障民族独立，反对侵略战争，维护世界和平”的政策，从道义上来帮助这些国家逐步解脱外国的统治和剥削，从而获得自由幸福。亚洲许多国家同我们过去的遭遇是相同的，社会经济的背景也有许多共同之处，因此这些国家的各方面的人士对新中国的情况感到兴趣，希望交流各方面的建设经验，这又是很自然的，正当的。
　  四、社会主义国家的国际主义
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，已经建立了消灭剥削的社会主义制度或正在过渡到社会主义制度。苏联建国三十七年来的事实已经充分证明了这个制度的优越性。这个制度是建立在劳动人民平等地、互助合作地进行生产，同时根据按劳取酬的原则进行分配的生产关系底基础之上的。社会主义社会的生产其目的不是为了获取利润，而是为了最大限度地满足整个社会不断增长的物质和文化的需要；因此它既不存在生产同消费之间的不可调和的矛盾，没有过剩的商品和过剩的资金，也不会产生经济危机。它的全部生产主要是为了国内的直接需要，同国外进行平等互利的贸易也是配合本国生产和消费的需要。这同垄断资本主义的生产以获取最大限度利润为目的有本质区别。在这两种社会制度的对比之下，谁要求战争，谁要求和平，是很容易理解的。
    东欧各人民民主国家，是在各该国人民经过反法西斯战争的残酷斗争获得胜利，由人民掌握了自己的命运，才建立起过渡到社会主义的人民民主制度的。各该国人民所以选择社会主义制度而不选择资本主义制度，正如美国在独立运动胜利后只选择资本主义的民主制度而不选择封建制度具有一样的道理。这是人民的觉悟和人民的常识，谁也不愿意丢掉甜瓜去拣苦瓜。东欧各人民民主国家的人民以空前高涨的劳动热忱建设他们的国家并衷心热爱他们的社会制度。举几个简单数字来说明：捷克斯洛伐克解放十年来的工业发展将近过去一百五十年所达到的水平一倍以上，百分之九十七的城市和乡村都已电气化了。民主德国第一个五年计划的头四年
  （一九五一—一九五四），工业生产总值增加了百分之七十六，和一九三六年相比，产量提高将近一倍，同时期文化和科学方面的经费也增加将近一倍。匈牙利在解放后的十年中工业生产总量已较战前增加三倍，而战前由外国资本控制的匈牙利在二十年间工业总产量仅增加了百分之二十。波兰在解放后的十年中工业生产总值增为战前的四倍，钢的产量已相当于法国。其他各人民民主国家的发展情况也相仿。毫无疑问，苏联对于这些国家的经济发展曾给予巨大的援助，这种援助完全本着无私的国际主义精神，从物质上技术上帮助这些国家建设以重工业为基础的独立的国民经济，不附带任何政治条件。假如把这种情况同美国垄断资本对待中南美洲各国相比，那末什么是殖民主义，什么是国际主义，对于稍有理性和判断能力的人，应该是很容易理解的。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的各国对待亚非等落后国家的政策，是充满着道义精神的。苏联曾一再表示愿意根据各国的请求，给予必要的技术经济援助。苏联同已经同它签订贸易协定的亚、非、南美各国的贸易关系，充分说明其主旨是在于帮助这些经济落后的国家建设工业和独立的国民经济。美、英、法等国的垄断资本集团却一贯地要阻止和破坏落后国家建设工业，尤其是重工业，它们严格控制不对这些国家输出机器设备和重工业原料。而苏联和各人民民主国家恰恰相反，除军需品、武器而外，凡有利于各国经济发展的物资都愿意作尽可能的供应。最近帮助印度建立年产一百万吨钢的冶金联合工厂的事例，帮助阿富汗建立工业和交通事业的事例，都是国际经济关系中体现了国际主义精神的范例。我国同许多国家所缔结的贸易协定，也充分贯彻了平等互利的精神，虽然我国正在工业化时期，我们仍根据对方的需要供给工业器材和设备，并且以优惠的价格进口一些为垄断资本压价滞销的产品。
    在目前的国际关系中间，两种主要的对立趋势是很明显的，那就是由垄断资本主义所产生的殖民主义和由社会主义产生的国际主义。前者的政策是奴役和剥削殖民地和附属国人民的政策，是国际纠纷和国际战争的根源；后者的政策是根据平等互利的原则，帮助落后国家发展其独立的国民经济、提高其人民生活水平的政策，是和平和繁荣的发展因素。一切爱好和平和自由的人们，应该维护和发扬国际主义来反对和消灭殖民主义。
