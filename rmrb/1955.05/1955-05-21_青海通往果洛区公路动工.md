    Construction on the highway from Qinghai Province to the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Region began in early May. The newly built roadbed has already extended more than ten kilometers from Huashixia, north along the Yellow River on the Qingkang Highway.

    The highway from Huashixia to Ji Mai, where the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Region government is located, requires the construction of forty-three wooden bridges and culverts, as well as the construction of ferries at the Yellow River crossings. To ensure the rapid opening of the highway and to reduce the transportation burden at the construction site, all wooden structures for the bridges, culverts, and ferries will be prefabricated in Xining and then transported to the construction site for installation.

　  青海通往果洛区公路动工
    青海省通往果洛藏族自治区的公路已在五月上旬动工修筑。新筑的路基已从青康公路黄河沿北的花石峡向前延伸了十多公里。
    这条公路从花石峡到果洛藏族自治区政府所在地吉迈共需修筑木桥和涵洞四十三处，在黄河渡口还要修建渡船。为了保证公路的迅速通车和减轻工地的运输负担，桥涵和渡船的木质结构将全部在西宁预先制好，然后运到工地安装。　（新华社）
