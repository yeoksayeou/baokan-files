The state-owned Fushan Mechanical Farm in Hainan Island is planning to plant tropical crops such as sisal, citronella, and coffee. Sisal is an indispensable raw material for manufacturing machine drive belts and ship ropes; citronella is a raw material used to make high-grade perfumes. Currently, more than 1,300 mu of sisal, more than 2,600 mu of citronella, and more than 280 mu of coffee have been planted successively. Citronella can already be harvested in large quantities.

The state-owned Fushan Mechanical Farm is located on the grassland of Chengmai County in the northeast of the island. The total area of the farm is 400,000 mu, of which 130,000 mu can be utilized. Since the establishment of the farm in February 1954, 16,000 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed. At present, various cash crops have been planted on more than 11,000 mu of land. In the future, the state-owned Fushan Mechanical Farm plans to focus on developing sisal, while also planting appropriate amounts of cash crops such as citronella, coffee, and pineapple. The farm has now formulated a comprehensive plan for developing production. (Xinhua News Agency)

　  福山农场种植剑麻等作物
    海南岛国营福山机械农场有计划地种植剑麻、香茅和咖啡等热带作物。剑麻是制造带动机器的皮带和轮船缆绳所不可缺少的原料；香茅是做上等香水用的原料。现在先后栽植的剑麻有一千三百多亩，香茅二千六百多亩，咖啡二百八十多亩。香茅已经可以大量地得到收获。
    国营福山机械农场设在岛东北部澄迈县的草原上。全场面积有四十万亩，其中可以利用的土地有十三万亩。从一九五四年二月农场建立以来，已经开出荒地一万六千亩。目前，在一万一千多亩的土地上种下了各种经济作物。今后，国营福山机械农场准备以发展剑麻为主，同时适当的栽种香茅、咖啡、菠萝等经济作物。现在，农场已制定了全面发展生产的计划。　（新华社）
