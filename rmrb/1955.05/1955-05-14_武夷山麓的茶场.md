    A new type of state-owned tea farm—the Chong'an Tea Farm in Fujian Province—is growing at the foot of Wuyi Mountain. Half a year ago, apart from a small old tea garden, this place was still a barren hill covering an area of about four thousand mu. Now, this barren hill has been newly ploughed by tractors, and more than 1.66 million excellent tea bushes have been transplanted and directly inserted into 1,250 mu of it. The earlier planted tea trees have already sprouted fresh, tender leaves. Another 1,800 mu have also been reclaimed, and it is planned to plant more than 2.4 million new tea bushes this winter and next spring. The workers have now cultivated two hundred mu of tea seedlings. The farm's director, Han Hui, told the reporter:
  "These large new tea gardens can be harvested successively in three to five years. During the peak production period, the total tea output of this new tea garden alone can reach three to four hundred thousand jin, which will exceed the highest annual output of Wuyi Rock Tea before the war by more than one time."
    Most of the tea farm's more than four thousand mu of land is acidic rock weathered soil, suitable for tea tree growth. The terrain slope is suitable for machine cultivation. The tea farm has successively purchased tractors, inter-row cultivators, weeding machines, kneading machines, and kill-green machines suitable for tea gardens. This year, the cultivation of new tea gardens and the planting of tea trees are all done with machine cultivation.
    There used to be a Chong'an Tea Farm here before liberation, but only more than three hundred mu of old tea trees remained at the time of liberation. Over the past few years, these old tea trees have mostly sprouted new leaves again through the careful nurturing of the employees. Some of the more than sixty mu of new tea trees planted by the workers in recent years have also begun to be harvested.

　　武夷山麓的茶场

    一个新型的国营茶场——福建省崇安茶场，正在武夷山麓成长起来。半年前，这里除一块面积不大的老茶园外，还是一片约四千亩面积的荒丘。现在这片荒丘已被拖拉机翻耕一新，其中一千二百五十亩已移植和直插下一百六十六万多丛优良茶树。栽植较早的茶树，已吐出青新的嫩叶。另外的一千八百多亩也已开垦出来，计划在今年冬季和明年春季种植二百四十多万丛新茶树。现在工人们已经培育了两百亩茶树苗。这个场的场长韩惠对记者说：
  “这大片新茶园三、五年后就可陆续采摘，在旺产期，光这一个新茶园的茶叶总产量可达三、四十万斤，将超过武夷岩茶战前最高年产量一倍多。”
    这个茶场的四千多亩土地，大部是含酸性的岩石分化土壤，适宜茶树生长。地势坡度适合机器耕作。茶场先后购置了适合茶园使用的拖拉机、中耕除草机和初制茶叶的揉捻机、杀菁机。今年开垦新茶园，种植茶树都是用机器耕作的。
    这里在解放前原有个崇安茶场，解放时只残存了三百多亩老茶树。几年来，经过职工们精心抚育，这些老茶树大部又吐出嫩叶。几年来工人们新栽的六十多亩新茶树，部分也已开始采摘。
