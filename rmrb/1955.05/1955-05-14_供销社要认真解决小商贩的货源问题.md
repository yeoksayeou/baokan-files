　　Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Should Conscientiously Solve the Commodity Supply Problem for Small Vendors
　　Jiao Wei
    Currently, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions face two relatively common problems in their wholesale business with rural private merchants: one is that the variety of goods controlled by the supply and marketing cooperatives cannot meet the business needs of small vendors; the other is that supply and marketing cooperatives are unwilling to wholesale popular goods to small vendors and forcibly bundle slow-moving goods. Both of these problems must be addressed, otherwise it will affect the transformation of small vendors and the smooth development of the wholesale business of supply and marketing cooperatives.
    Small vendors have very little capital and deal in a wide variety of goods in small quantities. They use the method of running errands diligently, visiting many villages, and quickly selling goods to keep their small amount of capital circulating flexibly. Grasping these characteristics and meeting the needs of small vendors as much as possible in terms of commodity supply is an important prerequisite for transforming small vendors.
    Some cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives have not recognized the importance of developing wholesale business for transforming small vendors, and do not actively control and expand commodity sources. As a result, they cannot adapt to the business characteristics of small vendors, creating difficulties for small vendors to purchase goods. In Yiyang County, Henan Province, seven small vendors in District 1 requested the Xiaodian Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative to wholesale 137 kinds of goods, but the supply and marketing cooperative could only wholesale more than 60 kinds; in Xiping County, small vendors requested certain supply and marketing cooperatives to wholesale 55 kinds of goods, but the supply and marketing cooperative could only wholesale 5 kinds. This situation cannot but affect the business sentiment of small vendors, who said: We cannot afford to operate large commodities, and you do not have small commodities, so what else is there to do!
    Some cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives also believe that developing wholesale business is a good opportunity to promote slow-moving goods. Under the control of this idea, some supply and marketing cooperatives bundle slow-moving goods to small vendors, accounting for more than 50% of the total number of goods shipped. Currently, people are taking off cotton clothes and changing into single clothes. Some supply and marketing cooperatives in Yancheng County, Henan Province, still forcibly wholesale cotton shoes to small vendors. Small vendors are extremely worried about bundling slow-moving goods, and some people say disappointedly: Anyway, we have to bundle them sooner or later!
    As the saying goes, "It's not terrible not to sell money, it's terrible that the goods are not complete." Cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives should not only do a good job in the wholesale business for rural private merchants, but also actively open up wholesale commodity sources. Facts have proved that expanding commodity sources is possible. The Dongzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Neihuang County, Henan Province, had only 19 kinds of wholesale goods in mid-March. Due to actively opening up commodity sources, it increased to more than 70 kinds in late March. With the expansion of commodity sources, the turnover of wholesale business has also increased significantly, and the number of wholesale households has increased from 35 to 62. It can be seen that there are many benefits to conscientiously solving the commodity supply problem: it not only facilitates small vendors, but also expands the business of supply and marketing cooperatives, and better meets the needs of the vast number of consumers. The practice of not actively controlling commodity sources, not being willing to wholesale popular goods to small vendors, and forcibly bundling slow-moving goods must be changed quickly.

### 供销社要认真解决小商贩的货源问题

　　供销社要认真解决小商贩的货源问题
　　焦维
    目前各地供销合作社对农村私商经营批发业务，存在两个较为普遍的问题：一个是供销社所掌握的货物品种不能满足小商小贩经营的要求；一个是供销社不愿意给小商小贩批发热货和硬性地搭配冷背货。对这两个问题都必须注意解决，不然，就会影响对小商小贩的改造，就会影响供销社批发业务的顺利开展。
    小商小贩的本钱很小，经营的货物品种多而数量少。他们采用勤跑腿、多串乡、勤进快销的办法，使仅有的小量资金灵活地周转起来。掌握这些特点，尽可能地在货源方面满足小商小贩的需要，是改造小商小贩的重要前提。
    有些供销社干部没有认识到开展批发业务对改造小商小贩的重要性，不积极掌握货源和扩大货源，结果不能适应小商小贩的经营特点，造成了小商小贩进货的困难。河南省伊阳县一区七户小商小贩要求小店镇供销社批发给一百三十七种货物，供销社只能批发给六十多种；西平县的小商小贩要求某些供销社批发给五十五种货物，供销社只能批发给五种。这种情况，不能不影响小商小贩的经营情绪，他们说：大商品俺经营不起，小商品你们没有，这还有啥干头！
    有些供销社干部还认为开展批发业务是推销冷背货的好机会。在这种思想支配下，有些供销社给小商小贩搭配的冷背货竟达总发货数的百分之五十以上。目前群众正在脱棉衣换单衣，河南郾城县有的供销社还硬把棉鞋批发给小商小贩。小商小贩对搭配冷背货极为耽心，有些人失望地说：反正早晚都得搭配干！
    俗话说：“不怕不卖钱，就怕货不全。”供销社的干部不仅应该作好对农村私商进行批发业务的工作，而且应该积极开辟批发货源，事实证明，扩大货源是可能的。河南省内黄县东庄供销社，三月中旬的批发商品仅有十九种，由于积极开辟货源，三月下旬就增加到七十多种。随着货源的扩大，批发业务的营业额也显著上升，批发户数由三十五户增加到六十二户。由此可见，认真解决货源问题的好处是多方面的：既便利了小商小贩，也扩大了供销社的业务，并且更好地满足了广大消费者的需要。那种不积极掌握货源，不乐意给小商小贩批发热货和硬性搭配冷背货的做法，必须很快改变。
