The British authorities in Hong Kong dispatched more than 400 armed police on May 9 to forcibly seize the warehouse of the China National Aviation Corporation on Ma Tau Wai Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong, injuring four employees of the China National Aviation Corporation and handing over the aforementioned warehouse and its affiliated assets to the American company Siberly, which was instructed by the American imperialist element Claire Chennault. The Chinese people are extremely indignant at this illegal and brutal act by the British authorities in Hong Kong, and fully support the protest statement by Wang Fengwu, Acting Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.

As early as December 3, 1949, Premier Zhou Enlai solemnly declared that all assets of the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Aviation Transport Corporation remaining in Hong Kong were the property of the People's Republic of China, and no one was allowed to infringe, move, or damage them by any means. However, for several years, the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong, disregarding the solemn statement of our government, illegally adjudicated 71 aircraft and their affiliated assets of our two airlines, China National Aviation Corporation and Central Aviation Transport Corporation, remaining in Hong Kong to Chennault in July and October 1952. Now, the aforementioned warehouse of the China National Aviation Corporation has been illegally adjudicated to the American company Siberly, which was instructed by the American imperialist element Chennault. This is another unreasonable and serious infringement by the British authorities in Hong Kong on the state property of our two airlines in Hong Kong. This cannot but be regarded as another unfriendly act by the British authorities in Hong Kong towards our government and people.

Not only that, the British authorities in Hong Kong even dispatched a large number of armed police to coerce the employees of the China National Aviation Corporation stationed in the aforementioned warehouse to withdraw. When our employees righteously and sternly denounced their illegal infringement of our state property, the Hong Kong police brazenly beat our employees, causing injuries to four people. The Chinese people express unparalleled indignation at this brutal act.

The Chinese people fully support the solemn demand of Wang Fengwu, Acting Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, that the British authorities in Hong Kong must immediately return the warehouse of the China National Aviation Corporation and its affiliated assets in full, immediately stop the persecution of our employees remaining in Hong Kong, and compensate for all losses. Otherwise, the British authorities in Hong Kong must bear all the consequences arising therefrom.

　　抗议香港英国当局非法侵占我在港财产
    香港英国当局于五月九日派遣武装警察四百余人强行侵占我中国航空公司在香港九龙马头围道仓库，殴伤我中国航空公司职工四人，并将上述仓库房屋及其附属资财交与受美帝国主义分子陈纳德指使的美商西伯勒公司。中国人民对香港英国当局这种非法的横暴行为极端愤慨，并完全拥护我民用航空局王凤梧代局长的抗议声明。
    早在一九四九年十二月三日我周恩来总理即已郑重声明，中国航空公司和中央航空公司留在香港的全部资财是中华人民共和国国家财产，不容许任何人以任何手段侵犯、移动或损坏。然而，数年以来，英国政府和香港英国当局不顾我国政府的严正声明，先后在一九五二年七月和十月将我中国和中央两航空公司留在香港的飞机七十一架及其附属资财非法判给了陈纳德。现在又将我中国航空公司上述仓库房屋非法判给美帝国主义分子陈纳德所指使的美商西伯勒公司。这是香港英国当局对我两航空公司在香港的国家财产的又一次无理的严重的侵犯。这不能不视为香港英国当局对我国政府和人民的又一次不友好的行为。
    不仅如此，香港英国当局竟出动大批武装警察胁迫我中国航空公司留守在上述仓库的员工退出。当我员工义正词严地指斥其非法侵犯我国家财产时，香港警察竟对我员工肆行殴打，以致四人受伤。中国人民对此种横暴行为表示无比的愤慨。
    中国人民完全支持我民用航空局王凤梧代局长的严正要求，香港英国当局必须立即全部交还我中国航空公司仓库房屋及其附属资财，立即停止对我留港员工的迫害行为，并赔偿一切损失。否则，由此产生的一切后果香港英国当局必须承担全部责任。
