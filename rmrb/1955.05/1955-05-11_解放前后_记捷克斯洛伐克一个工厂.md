　　Before and After Liberation - A Record of a Factory in Czechoslovakia

　　On the border between Czechoslovakia and Poland lies the Carpathian mountain range. The Tatra Mountains are a famous high-altitude resort area in Czechoslovakia. A highway here connects with other highways, making transportation very convenient. On January 28, 1955, I followed this highway to the Svět (Svit) Artificial Silk Factory.

　　On either side here are high mountains, with a long, narrow valley in between. A cluster of modern high-rise factory buildings appears in this valley. Its commanding posture makes it seem as if all the peaks of the Greater and Lesser Tatra are beneath its notice.

　　The villages I passed through on the road were small and sparsely populated. The agricultural producers' cooperative in front of the artificial silk factory was also hidden in the ever-present clouds and mist, with only a small patch of flat farmland visible, and more of it was still forest. Factories, after all, are not scenic spots, so why build one here? An introduction to the factory's historical situation will make it easier to understand.

　　"This place is 720 meters above sea level. There are 5,000 residents, most of whom are workers in this factory," the factory负责人(fùzé rén - person in charge) told me. "This factory was established in 1934. Before I tell you the reasons for building the factory, I must first tell you that this factory used to belong to 'Baťa', and it was part of the 'Baťa' shoe factory..."

　　The "Baťa" shoe factory is now a Czechoslovak state-owned enterprise and has been renamed the "Bright" Shoe Factory. I went there a few days ago.

　　The skyscraper-style buildings of the Bright Shoe Factory and the high-rise buildings here are the same in format and smell. I can't help but talk about the person "Baťa" and his shoe factory.

　　The "Baťa" shoe factory was established in 1890 in Zlín (now Gottwaldov). The factory's workshops were located in many ten-story buildings. Baťa's office was in the tallest skyscraper in the city. The boss of "Baťa" worked while sitting in an elevator - this elevator was large enough to accommodate a complete set of sofas and desks, and four lights were needed to illuminate it. The purpose of working here was to supervise all parts of the factory, going to the fourth floor one moment and the eighth floor the next. (After the factory was nationalized, the new owners cleverly used this facility to set up a mobile propaganda station in the elevator office). Some people say that Baťa absolutely loved skyscrapers, but that is not the case, the dormitories he built for the employees were not tall at all, almost like pigeon cages.

　　Baťa became wealthy after marrying the daughter of the Austrian Emperor's physician. He became a bureaucratic capitalist, monopolizing the business of supplying leather boots to the army, and later acquired a large amount of leather during the First World War. His enterprise was monopolistic from the beginning.

　　The boss of "Baťa" liked to handle everything himself. He not only set up shoe stores all over the world, but also established raw material purchasing stations. For example, he did not like brokers to be involved in the purchase of leather.

　　In this way, it is not difficult to find the reasons for his choice of this remote place to build this artificial silk factory. Because part of the "Baťa" shoe factory produced tires, and tires require artificial silk.

　　"Now you should understand, there are four reasons for building the factory here," the factory负责人(fùzé rén - person in charge) continued: "First, artificial silk needs fiber, and there are forests here, close to the raw material source. Second, the water source is good, which is one of the important conditions for an artificial silk factory. Third, there is a railway, making transportation convenient. Fourth, there is no commerce... I must explain that he must find a place without commerce to build the factory. You also saw in Gottwaldov that the commerce there used to be all his own. The same is true here. At the same time as the factory was established, he established his own commerce, from department stores to vegetable markets, and even including hotels. That was his habit, the purpose was to create a Baťa commercial system..."

　　I can imagine that ten years ago this factory was exactly the same as the "Baťa" shoe factory: countless peasants were deprived of their land and turned into workers. From then on, they were put on Baťa's invisible shackles, exploited in the factory every day, and even when they stepped out of the factory gate, they were not relaxed, because any shop was "Baťa's"...

　　This is the past of the Svět Artificial Silk Factory.

　　II

　　Now it has been ten years since liberation here. The day I arrived was the anniversary of the liberation of this region. In the afternoon, I participated in the grand celebration held here.

　　The celebration was held in the indoor stadium. This is the second largest indoor stadium in Czechoslovakia. Workers, peasants, citizens, students... all attended the meeting. The iron罩(zhào - cover) lamps unique to indoor stadiums were all lit up. The young female workers' red scarves and delicate faces, mixed with various flags and banners, gave the impression that the entire venue was constantly rolling inside a circle as soon as you walked in.

　　The administrative head of the state and the leading cadres of the factory were all seated on the rostrum. Behind them hung the national flags of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.

　　The Chairman of the State People's Committee said at the celebration:

　　"...The Czechoslovak people's struggle to liberate their motherland is inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party. Many people in this region sacrificed their lives in the struggle. ...When the Soviet army liberated this region ten years ago today, we welcomed these heroes from Stalingrad with excitement and gratitude... The Slovak people's uprising at that time was all our hope and strength. The Czechoslovak people fought against all enemies at home and abroad to liberate their motherland, proving that our people have the power to achieve freedom..."

　　Then, in his report, he explained the improvement of the people's lives in this region after liberation and the achievements of construction over the past ten years.

　　This state is considered to have the largest proportion of industry. Among the many new enterprises built after liberation are food joint factories and meat processing factories.

　　In Czechoslovakia, almost all rural areas have new bus routes. As far as the area I have walked through is concerned, it is unimaginable if a farmer cannot drive his own motorcycle to any place.

　　Therefore, the requirements of such rural areas are the same as those of a small city. Telephones have been installed in every rural area, and the State People's Committee can talk to any rural area. The report said that there are currently only two extremely remote villages in this state that have not yet been connected to telephone lines, but they must be completed this year.

　　In addition, rural tap water systems have been built in the past ten years. At present, sewer projects have begun in several rural areas.

　　Recently, the state has also opened an economic school and two ordinary middle schools. Since liberation, five middle schools, three nurseries, and a large number of houses have been added here. According to statistics, four thousand pairs of men and women have married here since liberation. The state subsidizes each newly married couple with one thousand crowns. At the same time, 708 newly married couples received state loans.

　　The improvement of people's lives can be proved by the following facts.

　　In 1953, state-owned stores here sold more than 2,000 radios and 80 electric washing machines. In 1954, state-owned stores sold 3,120 radios and 860 electric washing machines.

　　The Chairman concluded: "Every achievement of ours is a stumbling block for the enemy, so they often use broadcasting to slander our achievements. The Slovak people will never forget that the heroic Soviet army brought us the beginning of happiness. Our happy life will be endless. We will build the best sports field, we will rebuild workers' houses, and we will build new streets and parks. All this is to allow the heroes of socialist construction to spend their rest time comfortably after work. Someone asked: At what speed will we build our future? I want to answer: It depends on ourselves, and of course we must build it at the greatest speed..."

　　The Young Pioneers read a letter of tribute to the Young Pioneers of Stalingrad at the celebration; the men and women of the Youth League also passed a resolution against the rearmament of West Germany at the meeting. At this time, an old man in a black tuxedo with gray hair walked to the rostrum. He placed a copy of the state's chronicle in front of everyone and asked for signatures. Everyone at this time thought of the hard struggle ten years ago, the happy life now, today's resolution and future construction. They are all witnesses to history, sign it! Because the future history belongs to the people... When the last person signed, the old man's face also showed youthful radiance...

　　At this time, all the people under the stage stood up, the singing was interrupted, and a burst of hearty cheers rang out...

　　In the evening, I met with the youth members of a knitting factory here. They told me that the happiest thing they considered was meeting many young Chinese friends at the World Youth and Student Festival; but not every factory has the opportunity to send representatives, so they should first thank their factory with a glorious tradition.

　　Their factory has greatly increased its output since liberation. In the competition, this factory has won four awards in a row. A youth team in the sock-making workshop reduced costs by 270,000 crowns due to saving materials. At today's meeting, the Youth League members pledged to save another 252,368 crowns in tailoring.

　　"We want to propose a competition to the agricultural producers' cooperative." One of the young people said to me: "They produce grain, we produce daily necessities, you think this is very interesting, you have to eat bread every day, don't you have to wear socks and shirts every day? This competition is very necessary, everyone must always think of the speed mentioned at today's meeting..."

　　The "Baťa" of the past now belongs to the people. After talking with these young people, I deeply believe that the wheels of history will move forward with this speed and confidence. This speed is the speed required at the celebration meeting; the confidence is the confidence shown by the young man sitting in front of me.

    解放前后——记捷克斯洛伐克一个工厂
　　雷加
　　一
    在捷克斯洛伐克和波兰交接的国境上，横卧着喀尔巴阡山脉。塔特拉山是捷克斯洛伐克的有名的高山休养地区。这里有一条公路和别的公路连结起来，交通非常方便。一九五五年一月二十八日，我顺着这条公路，到了斯维特人造丝工厂。
    这里的两边有高山，中间是一条狭长的山谷。一片高层近代厂房建筑，出现在这条山谷之中。它的高视远瞩的姿态，就像大塔特拉和小塔特拉的一切山峰都不在它的眼里一样。
    我走过的公路上，村庄不大，人烟稀少。人造丝厂前面的那个农业生产合作社，也隐蔽在常聚不散的云雾里，只能看见一小片平坦的耕地，更多的还是森林。工厂终究不是名胜，为什么要建筑在这里呢？介绍一下这个工厂的历史情况，我们就容易了解了。
    “这里海拔七百二十公尺。居民有五千人，其中大部分是这个工厂的工人。”工厂负责人这样对我说道：“这个工厂是一九三四年建立的。在说建厂的原因之前，我得首先告诉你，这个工厂过去是属于‘拔佳’的，它和‘拔佳’鞋厂是一家……”
      “拔佳”鞋厂现在已是捷克斯洛伐克的国营企业，并已改名叫做光明鞋厂。前些日子我就去过那里。
    光明鞋厂的摩天楼式的建筑，和这里的高层建筑，在格式上是一样的，在气味上也是一样的。我不能不说说“拔佳”这个人和他的鞋厂了。
    “拔佳”鞋厂一八九○年建立在瑞林（即现在的哥特瓦尔多夫城）。这个工厂的车间分设在许多十层大楼中间。拔佳的办公地点就在这个城市的最高的一座摩天楼里。“拔佳”的老板是坐在电梯里办公的——这个电梯里边大得可以摆设整套的沙发和办公桌，需要用四盏电灯来照明。在这里办公，是为了便于监督工厂的各个部分，一会儿到四楼，一会到八楼。（在工厂收归国有以后，新的主人很巧妙地利用了这个设备，在这所电梯办公室里设立了一个活动的宣传鼓动站）。有人说拔佳是绝对喜欢摩天楼的人，其实也不然，他给职工盖的宿舍就一点也不高，简直和鸽子笼差不多。
    拔佳是在和奥国国王的御医的女儿结婚之后发起家来的。他成了一个官僚资本家，包揽了供应军队皮靴的生意，后来又在第一次世界大战中收购大批皮革。他的企业一开始就是独占的。
    “拔佳”的老板什么事情都喜欢一手包办。他不仅在世界各地遍设鞋店，而且还设立原料收购站。比如皮革的收购，他也不喜欢经纪人过手。
    这样看来，他选择这个边远地方建立这个人造丝厂，也就不难找出它的原因来了。因为“拔佳”鞋厂有一部分是生产轮胎的，而轮胎需要人造丝。
    “现在你该明白了，在这里建厂的原因有四个，”工厂负责人继续说：“第一，人造丝需要纤维，这里有森林，接近原料地。第二，水源好，这是人造丝厂的重要条件之一。第三，有铁道，交通方便。第四，没有商业……我必需解释一下，他建厂一定要找一个没有商业的地方。你在哥特瓦尔多夫也看到了，那里的商业过去都是他自己的。这里也是一样，和工厂建立的同时，他建立了自己的商业，从百货公司到菜市场，甚至包括旅馆在内。他的习惯如此，目的是要造成拔佳的商业系统……”
    我想像得出，十年以前这个工厂是和“拔佳”鞋厂一模一样的：无数农民被剥夺了土地，变成了工人，从此，他们脖子上套上了拔佳的看不见的枷锁，天天在工厂里受剥削，即使走出工厂大门，也没有放松他们，因为任何商店都是“拔佳”的……
    这就是斯维特人造丝厂的过去。
    二
    现在这里已经解放十年了。我到的这一天正是这个地区的解放纪念日。下午，我参加了这里举行的盛大的庆祝会。
    庆祝会是在室内运动场举行的。这是捷克斯洛伐克全国第二个最大的室内运动场。参加会的有工人，农民，市民，学生……室内运动场特有的铁罩灯，通通亮了起来。年青的女工们的红围巾和娇嫩的面孔，同各种旗子彩幅交混在一起，刚走进去，就像整个会场在一个圆体内不住地滚动着一样。
    全州的行政首长，工厂的领导干部都坐在主席台上。在他们的身后挂着捷苏两国国旗。
    州人民委员会主席在庆祝会上说道：
      “……捷克斯洛伐克人民解放祖国的斗争，是和共产党的领导分不开的。在斗争中有很多人在这个地区献出了自己的生命。……当苏联军队在十年前的今天解放这个地区的时候，我们怀着兴奋而又感激的心情，欢迎这些来自斯大林格勒的英雄们……斯洛伐克人民的起义，当时就是我们的一切希望和力量。捷克斯洛伐克人民为了解放自己的祖国，和国内外一切敌人进行斗争，证明了我们人民是有力量取得自由的……”
    接着，他在报告里说明了解放后这个地区人民生活的改善和十年来建设的成就。
    这个州被认为是工业比重最大的一个州。在解放以后新建的许多企业中，包括食品联合工厂和制肉工厂等。
    在捷克斯洛伐克，几乎所有的农村都新建了公共汽车路线。据我走过的地区而言，如果一个农民不能开着自己的摩托车到任何地方去，那是不可想像的。
    因之，这样的农村所要求的和一个小城市一样。每个农村都安装了电话，州人民委员会可以和任何农村通话。报告中说，这个州现在只有两个极偏僻的乡村还没有架设电话线，但在今年一定要完成。
    此外，这十年来兴建了农村的自来水道。目前又在几个农村中开始了下水道的工程。
    最近这个州还开办了一所经济学校，两所普通中学。解放以后，这里已增加了五所中学，三个托儿所，和新建了大批住宅。据统计，解放以后这里有四千多对男女结了婚。国家对每一对新婚夫妇都津贴一千克朗。同时其中还有七百零八对新婚夫妇得到了国家贷款。
    人民生活的提高，可由下列事实得到证明。
    一九五三年一年内，这里的国营商店共售出收音机二千多台，电气洗衣机八十台。一九五四年国营商店售出收音机三千一百二十台，电气洗衣机八百六十台。
    这位主席最后说：“我们每一个成就，都是敌人的绊脚石，因此他们才常常用广播来诽谤我们所得的成就。斯洛伐克人民永远不会忘记，英勇的苏联军队给我们带来了幸福的开端。我们的幸福的生活，将是无尽无止的。我们要建立最好的运动场，我们要改建工人的住宅，我们还要建造新的街道和公园。这一切都是为了让建设社会主义的英雄们，能够在工作之后很舒适地度过自己的休息时间。有人问：我们将以什么速度来建设自己的将来呢？我要回答说：这要靠我们自己，我们当然要以最大的速度来建设的……”
    少先队员们在庆祝大会上，宣读了向斯大林格勒的少先队员们致敬的信；男女青年盟员们，也在大会上通过了反对武装西德的决议。这时，一个穿黑礼服，头发斑白的老人走到主席台上。他把一本州大事记放在每个人的面前，请求签名。每个人这时都想起了十年前的艰苦的斗争，目前的幸福的生活，今天的决议和将来的建设。他们都是历史的见证人，签上名吧！因为未来的历史是属于人民的……签到最后一个人的时候，这个老人的脸上也现出了年青的光彩……
    这时台下全体人民站了起来，歌声被打断了，响起了一片尽情的欢呼……
    晚上，我同这里的一个针织厂的青年盟员们见了面。他们告诉我说，他们认为最幸福的一件事，是在世界青年与学生联欢节上认识了许多中国青年朋友；但是并不是每个工厂都有派遣代表的机会，所以他们首先应该感谢他们的有着光荣传统的工厂。
    他们的工厂从解放以来，已大大地提高了产量。在竞赛中，这个工厂连着得过四次奖励。制袜车间一个青年小组，由于节省材料而降低成本二十七万克朗。在今天的会上，青年盟员们又提出保证，要在剪裁上再节约二十五万二千三百六十八克朗。
    “我们要向农业生产合作社提出竞赛。”其中一个青年对我说：“他们生产粮食，我们生产日用必需品，你想想这个是很有趣的，每天都得吃面包，不是每天也得穿袜子穿衬衣吗？这个竞赛是很必要的，每个人都要常常想到今天大会上讲的那个速度……”
    过去的“拔佳”今天已经属于人民了。在同这些青年们谈过话后，我深深地相信，历史的车轮，将顺着这种速度和信心前进。这种速度，就是庆祝大会上所要求的那个速度；信心，就是坐在我前面的这个青年所表现出来的信心。
