Xinhua News Agency, May 24th Dispatch from Los Angeles: U.S. Under Secretary of State Herbert Hoover Jr. delivered a speech in Los Angeles on the 23rd regarding U.S. Far East policy.

Speaking about the situation in the Taiwan area, Hoover distorted Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China's recent report on the Asian-African Conference concerning the liberation of Taiwan, attempting to obliterate the positive significance of Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the Taiwan issue during the Asian-African Conference. Hoover did not indicate that the U.S. government would take any positive attitude in direct negotiations with China, only repeating the cliché of a "ceasefire." At the same time, he repeatedly emphasized in the speech that the United States could not "lose" Taiwan and Penghu, stressing the U.S. determination to seize Taiwan and Penghu, and not allow them to return to the hands of the Chinese people. To defend the U.S. position of occupying Taiwan and Penghu, he distorted history, saying that these islands "barely belonged to China" for centuries before being seized by Japanese imperialism in 1895.

In his speech, Hoover attempted to separate Jinmen and Mazu from Taiwan, and said that regarding Jinmen and Mazu, "the United States will not sit idly by and allow these positions to be captured." In his speech, Hoover also attacked some of China's neighbors who were unwilling to participate in the military blocs created by the United States, saying that "their position is wrong" because "it violates the basic obligations of mutual assistance between countries."

Hoover's speech, like Dulles' recent remarks, promoted a "policy of strength" under the guise of some peaceful words. He indicated that despite many important events recently that have favored easing international tensions, the United States, both in Asia and Europe, still has no intention of changing this policy. He said that one of the most important goals of the United States in the Far East is to establish what he calls a "collective security system" in the region, which is to say, to establish aggressive military blocs.

### 美国副国务卿胡佛发表政策演说　强调要继续强占我领土台湾

　　美国副国务卿胡佛发表政策演说
  　强调要继续强占我领土台湾
    新华社二十四日讯　洛杉矶消息：美国副国务卿小赫伯特·胡佛二十三日在洛杉矶发表关于美国远东政策的演说。
    胡佛在谈到台湾地区局势问题时，对中华人民共和国周恩来总理最近关于亚非会议的报告中有关解放台湾的话加以歪曲，力图抹煞周恩来总理在亚非会议期间发表的关于台湾问题的声明的积极意义。胡佛没有表明美国政府在同中国举行直接谈判方面将要采取任何积极的态度，只是重复了“停火”的滥调。他同时在演说中以主要的篇幅，再三强调美国不能“丢失”台湾和澎湖，强调美国决意要侵占台湾和澎湖，不让它们回到中国人民手中。为了替美国侵占台湾和澎湖的立场辩护，他歪曲历史，说什么这些岛屿在一八九五年被日本帝国主义强占以前的几世纪中，“只是勉强地属于中国的。”
    胡佛在演说中企图把金门、马祖和台湾割裂开来，并且说，对于金门和马祖，“美国将不会坐视不管而让这些阵地被攻占”。胡佛在演说中还攻击不愿参加美国所制造的军事集团的一些中国的邻国，说什么“它们的立场是错误的”，“因为它违背了国家之间进行互助的基本义务”。
    胡佛的演说同杜勒斯最近发表的言论一样，在一些和平言词的装饰下鼓吹“实力政策。”他表明，尽管最近期间发生了许多有利于和缓国际紧张局势的重要事件，但美国在亚洲如同在欧洲一样，仍然无意改变这种政策。他说，美国在远东的最重要的目标之一就是在这个地区建立一个他所谓的“集体安全体系”，也就是建立侵略性的军事集团。
