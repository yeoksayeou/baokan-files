The most arduous of the Fengtai-Shacheng (Fengsha) Railway's sixty-five tunnel projects were all completed in late May. Permanent ventilation mechanical equipment is now being installed.

The Fengsha Railway has the highest tunnel density of any railway in our country, with the total length of the tunnels accounting for nearly a quarter of the entire line. Among them is one of the longer tunnels we currently have in China. The biggest difficulty encountered by workers and technicians in building the tunnels was the complex geological conditions. However, they created various blasting methods, pierced the hard rocks, and finally overcame serious difficulties such as "cave-ins" and "quicksand."

In the course of construction, Soviet experts traveled to every key construction site and helped solve key problems in the project.

　  丰沙铁路隧道工程完工
    丰（台）沙（城）铁路最艰巨的六十五座隧道工程已在五月下旬全部完成。现在正在装置永久通风机械设备。
    丰沙铁路是我国隧道密度最大的铁路，隧道的总长几占全线长度的四分之一。其中有一座有我国现在较长的隧道之一。工人和技术人员在修建隧道中遇到的最大困难是地质情况复杂。但是他们创造了各种爆炸方法，凿穿了坚硬的岩石，终于克服了严重的“塌方”“流砂”等困难。
    在施工过程中，苏联专家走遍了每一个重点工地，帮助解决了工程中的关键问题。
