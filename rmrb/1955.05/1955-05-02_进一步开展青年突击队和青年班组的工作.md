      Organizing youth shock brigades and youth teams to bring into play the enthusiasm and creativity of young people in realizing the country's socialist industrialization is a successful experience of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League. After learning from this experience, the China Changchun Railway saw the emergence of many exemplary youth train groups. Under the influence of the China Changchun Railway, since 1951, some youth production teams and youth shock brigades have successively appeared in industrial and mining enterprises, capital construction, and transportation departments in some major cities of Liaoning Province, and they have also played a significant role. However, due to the lack of clear understanding of youth shock brigades and youth teams among the League's leadership, leadership was once relaxed. As a result, many youth teams were virtually dissolved. It was not until 1954, when the People's Daily published an editorial entitled "Bringing into Play the Active Role of Young Workers in National Construction" and the experience of the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Center construction area in carrying out the work of youth shock brigades, that it had a wide impact on cadres and young workers, and thus the work of youth shock brigades and youth teams was further developed. According to incomplete statistics, there are now 68 youth shock brigades in Liaoning Province, distributed in 14 trades such as carpentry, tile laying, cement, and plastering in 24 construction units; 144 youth advanced production teams, distributed in 35 trades in 56 enterprises; and 1 youth workshop. A total of more than 4,000 people in the province participated in youth shock brigades, youth advanced production teams, and youth workshops, of which adult and elderly workers accounted for about 18 percent, and Party and League members accounted for about 36 percent.
      These youth shock brigades and youth advanced production teams have played a significant role in completing national capital construction and production tasks.

  The general manifestations are: 1. Taking the lead in learning advanced experiences, exceeding quotas, and improving labor productivity. For example, in the tool workshop where Wang Chonglun of Anshan Machinery General Factory was located, after learning from Soviet advanced experience and using car planing tools, production efficiency increased by 30 percent. In 1953, they completed two years of production tasks in one year, and in 1954, they comprehensively overfulfilled the annual plan ahead of schedule by one month, and were thus named "Youth Workshop." The Youth Shock Brigade of the coal storage yard construction site of the First Engineering Area of the Fuxin Well Construction Engineering Office has consistently overfulfilled its tasks since it was named on October 25, 1954. Moreover, it also won the first-class prize of the engineering area in terms of quality and safety. All 33 youth shock brigades in Dalian City overfulfilled their tasks in the execution of their missions, with the lowest exceeding by 50 percent and the highest reaching 279.2 percent. 2. Being brave in overcoming difficulties, solving key production problems, and promoting labor competition. For example, the carbonization tower youth advanced team of the heavy alkali workshop of Dalian Alkali Plant, since 1951, has held many technical research meetings to solve the key production problem of tower blockage, and has learned and applied Soviet advanced experience. Finally, they successfully developed "group operation" and "cyclic crystallization method," fundamentally solving the key problem of tower blockage, rapidly increasing labor productivity, and overfulfilling tasks year after year. The underground culvert project constructed by the Jinzhou Municipal Construction Engineering Team had a national quota of 2.7 meters per person per day. Since 1949, the general achievement was only a little more than 1 meter. However, after the youth shock brigade accepted this task, it improved labor organization and implemented "small group joint operation," thus exceeding the quota by 51 percent and driving other teams to break the quota, completing the project 22 and a half days ahead of schedule. 3. Practicing strict economy, opposing waste, and increasing wealth for the country. For example, the Youth Shock Brigade of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Office saved 2,240 kilograms of cement in the completion of the 14-section concrete sewer project alone. The Youth Shock Brigade of the Fushun Steel Plant yard construction site, in the eleven days of October 1954, used its spare time to recover materials and tools such as pig iron screw rods and steel screws, with a total value of more than 3,300 yuan. The First Construction Company of Dalian City organized 386 League members and young people to participate in the savings team. In three months, in addition to timely clearing the site, it also recovered raw materials worth more than 22,000 yuan.

    In the actual labor of completing and overfulfilling the national plan, each member was educated to love labor and the collective, the level of communist consciousness of each member was improved, and other young people were also educated. For example, the carbonization tower youth team of the heavy alkali workshop of Dalian Alkali Plant, in the technical research meeting, determined ten operating methods. Wang Dequan, the operator of Class C tower, did not implement them seriously, and everyone criticized him. League member Fang Yongben said:
  "We are collective production, and any inconsistent action will cause losses." Wang Dequan accepted the criticism and made a self-criticism. He held a meeting with the personnel of Class C to study how to overcome this shortcoming and enhance organization and discipline. Zhang Naixian and Wang Zhong'an, League members of the Third Workshop of Anshan Steel Rope Factory, took the initiative to examine their shortcomings in disharmony with the old workers, making the relationship between young and old workers closer, thus inspiring the enthusiasm of the workers and promoting the development of labor competition.

    Youth shock brigades and youth teams have also played a positive role in enriching the content of the League's work and improving the League's work.

    The main problems existing in the work of youth shock brigades and youth teams in Liaoning Province are: First, the leaders of some cities and many grassroots League organizations lack sufficient understanding of the significance and purpose of establishing youth shock brigades and youth teams, so some are unable or unwilling to actively and proactively carry out this work, with many concerns, fearing that problems will arise after they are launched, fearing that others will label them with "independence" and "vanguardism," so they are timid. For example, the First Engineering Area of the Fourth Engineering Company of Liaoning implemented "secrecy" in the early stage of establishing a bricklaying youth team, and did not dare to officially name it until the project was completed. The leaders of many grassroots Party organizations, administrative departments, and trade unions are also very unclear about why youth shock brigades and youth teams should be established. For example, the secretary of a grassroots Party committee said: "It is enough to establish advanced teams, why should we have youth teams? Calling them youth teams will make the youth develop arrogance and complacency!" Some administrative leaders believe that shock brigades are just for shock work, regardless of the physical and mental health of young workers. Some grassroots trade union leaders unilaterally believe that naming them youth shock brigades or youth teams is the credit of the Communist Youth League; the establishment of youth shock brigades or teams is a matter for the Communist Youth League and has nothing to do with the trade union, etc. Second, there is a lack of regular leadership for the existing youth shock brigades or teams, which affects the healthy development of these shock brigades or teams, so that some have collapsed and some are not playing a role.

    The comprehensive development of the work of youth shock brigades and youth teams is still a beginning in the entire Liaoning Province. In order to ensure that this work can be carried out healthily, it is still necessary to adopt the policy of active leadership and steady development based on the needs of production and construction and adhering to the principle of voluntary participation of young workers, opposing both the conservative thinking of passive waiting and preventing the practice of establishing them for the sake of establishment, detached from production and the masses. A relatively stable approach is to cultivate them in the original production organization where young people account for the majority, production is needed, and the Party committee agrees. After creating achievements and conditions are ripe, it is recommended that the administration name them. In the preparation stage before the production of new factories or the construction of new projects, we can consciously organize and cultivate them. After starting production or construction, making achievements, and creating conditions, they can be named. Before naming, the grassroots League organization should conduct necessary education for each member. During the formal naming, a ceremony should generally be held, and the administration should issue an order and give a prize flag. After the official naming, the named team or group can propose new guarantee conditions, or it can propose competition conditions to other production organizations. The members of the youth shock brigades and teams can include some adult and elderly workers, and there can also be adult and elderly workers in the team, which is beneficial to the youth shock brigades and youth teams themselves. Secondly, once the youth shock brigade and youth team are established, the important issue is to strengthen its leadership so that it can be continuously consolidated and improved and play a greater role. It is necessary to strengthen political and ideological education, specifically help them learn technology, actively participate in labor competition, and closely cooperate with other teams. In actual labor, constantly improve their socialist consciousness. In addition, the League organization should also enrich the organizational life of the League in the youth shock brigades, youth workshops, and youth teams, give full play to the exemplary leading role of League members, and pay special attention to assisting the Party in cultivating key and core forces in order to strengthen the political and ideological leadership in the youth shock brigades, youth workshops, and youth teams. At the same time, we should care about their lives and health, and their deeds should be disseminated in a timely manner to educate and influence the vast number of young workers and guide everyone to move forward together.

　　进一步开展青年突击队和青年班组的工作
　　青年团辽宁省委员会书记　杨海波
　　副书记　毕文庭
      组织青年突击队和青年班组，以发挥青年在实现国家社会主义工业化事业中的积极性和创造性，是苏联列宁共产主义青年团的成功经验。中长铁路学习了这一经验后，出现了许多模范的青年包车组。在中长铁路的影响下，从一九五一年以来，辽宁省一些主要城市的工矿企业、基本建设及交通运输部门中，曾先后出现了一些青年生产班组和青年突击队，也起了不少作用。但因团的领导上，对青年突击队和青年班组缺乏明确认识，曾一度放松了领导。因此，有不少青年班组便无形取消了。直到一九五四年，人民日报发表了“发挥青年工人在国家建设中的积极作用”的社论和北京苏联展览馆工区开展青年突击队工作的经验以后，在干部和青年工人中产生了广泛的影响，因而青年突击队和青年班组工作便有了进一步的开展。据不完全的统计，现在辽宁省已有青年突击队六十八个，分布在二十四个建筑单位的木、瓦、水泥、抹灰等十四个工种中；青年先进生产班一百四十四个，分布在五十六个企业的三十五个工种中；青年车间一个。全省参加青年突击队、青年先进生产班、青年车间的人共有四千多个，其中成年、老年工人约占百分之十八，党团员约占百分之三十六。
      这些青年突击队和青年先进生产班组，在完成国家基本建设和生产任务中，均起了显著的作用。
  一般的表现是：一、带头学习先进经验，突破定额，提高劳动生产效率。如鞍山机械总厂王崇伦所在的工具车间，学习了苏联先进经验，使用车刨刀具后，提高生产效率百分之三十，一九五三年一年完成了两年的生产任务，一九五四年又提前一个月全面超额完成全年计划，因而被命名为“青年车间”；阜新建井工程处一工区贮煤仓工地青年突击队，自一九五四年十月二十五日命名以后，一直是超额完成任务。并且在质量和安全等方面，也获得了工区的甲等奖；旅大市的三十三个青年突击队，在执行任务中全都超额完成，最低者超额百分之五十，最高者达百分之二百七十九点二。二、勇于克服困难，解决生产关键，推动劳动竞赛。如大连碱厂重碱车间，炭化塔青年先进小组，从一九五一年以来，为解决堵塔的生产关键，先后召开了很多次技术研究会，并学习运用了苏联先进经验，最后终于研究成功“分组作业”和“循环结晶法”，从根本上解决了堵塔的关键问题，迅速地提高了劳动生产率，年年都能超额完成任务；锦州市政建设工程队施工的暗渠工程，国家定额是每人每天二点七公尺，从一九四九年以来一般的只能达到一公尺多，但在青年突击队接受了这个任务后，改善了劳动组织，实行了“小组联合作业”，因此超额百分之五十一，并带动了其他班组全都突破定额，推动了劳动竞赛，提前二十二天半完成了工程任务。三、厉行节约，反对浪费，为国家增加财富。如沈阳市政建设工程处青年突击队，仅在打完下水道十四段混凝土工程任务中，就节约了二千二百四十公斤水泥；抚顺钢厂场房工地青年突击队，在一九五四年十月份的十一天中，利用工余时间，回收了元铁螺丝杆、钢铁螺丝等材料和工具，价值共达三千三百多元；旅大市第一建筑公司，组织了三百八十六名团员和青年参加了节约队，在三个月内，除及时清理出现场外，并回收了价值达二万二千多元的原材料。
    在完成和超额完成国家计划的实际劳动中，又教育了每个成员要热爱劳动、热爱集体，提高了每个成员的共产主义觉悟程度，也教育了其他青年。如大连碱厂重碱车间炭化塔青年小组，在技术研究会上研究确定了十项操作方法，丙班司塔王德权未认真执行，大家便对他展开了批评。团员方永本说：
  “我们是集体生产，任何不一致的行动都会造成损失。”王德权接受批评并作了检讨，与丙班人员开会研究克服这一缺点，增强了组织性与纪律性。鞍山钢绳厂三工段团员张乃先、王忠安，主动地检讨了和老工人闹不团结的缺点，使青、老工人之间的关系更加密切，从而鼓舞了职工的积极性，推动了劳动竞赛的开展。
    青年突击队、青年班组，对于丰富团的工作内容，改进团的工作也起了积极的作用。
    现在辽宁省青年突击队、青年班组工作，存在的主要问题是：第一，有些市和不少基层团的组织的领导上，对建立青年突击队、青年班组的意义和目的认识不足，因而有的便不能或不敢积极主动地去开展这一工作，顾虑很多，怕搞起来以后出问题；怕别人给戴上“闹独立性”“先锋主义”的帽子，便缩手缩脚，像辽宁第四工程公司第一工区在建立砌砖青年小组的初期实行“保密”，直到工程竣工还没敢正式命名。在不少基层党组织、行政、工会的领导在思想上，对为什么要建立青年突击队、青年班组也很不明确。如有的基层党委书记说：“建立先进小组就够了，为什么还要搞青年小组呢？叫了青年小组，就会使青年滋长骄傲自满情绪！”有的行政领导上认为突击队就是突击，不顾青年工人的身心健康，有些基层工会的领导上片面的认为命名为青年突击队或青年班组，就是青年团的功劳；建立青年突击队或班组，是青年团的事，与工会无关等。第二，对已有的青年突击队或班组，缺少经常领导，因而便影响了这些突击队或班组的健康发展，以致有的垮了台，有的不起作用。
    全面开展青年突击队、青年班组的工作，在辽宁全省范围内来说，现在还是开始。为了使这一工作能健康的开展起来，当前还必须根据生产建设的需要和坚持青年工人自愿的原则，采取积极领导、稳步开展的方针，既要反对消极等待的保守思想，也要防止脱离生产、脱离群众为建立而建立的做法。比较稳妥的做法是，在原有生产组织中，青年占多数、生产又需要、经党委同意即可进行培养，待创造出成绩，条件成熟，再建议行政命名。在新的工厂生产前或新的工程施工前的准备阶段，就可有意识地进行组织和培养，待开始生产或施工后，作出成绩，创造了条件，即可命名。在命名前，基层团组织应对每个成员进行必要的教育，在正式命名时，一般的应举行仪式，由行政签发命令，发给奖旗。正式命名后，被命名的小队或班组，可以提出新的保证条件，也可向别的生产组织提出竞赛条件。在青年突击队和班组的成员中，可以包括一部分成年、老年工人，队里也可以有成年、老年工人，这对青年突击队和青年班组本身是有好处的。其次，青年突击队、青年班组一经建立后，重要的问题在于加强其领导，使之不断巩固和提高，发挥更大的作用。要加强政治思想教育工作，具体帮助他们学习技术，积极参加劳动竞赛，密切配合别的班组。要在实际劳动中，不断提高他们的社会主义觉悟。此外，团的组织还应充实青年突击队、青年车间和青年班组中团的组织生活，充分发挥团员的模范带头作用，还要特别注意协助党培养骨干、核心力量，以便加强青年突击队、青年车间和青年班组中的政治思想领导。同时，应关心他们的生活和健康，并应把他们的事迹及时传播出去，以教育和影响广大青年工人，引导大家共同前进。
