　　Today's Dien Bien Phu
　　— Commemorating the First Anniversary of Dien Bien Phu's Liberation
　　By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent in Vietnam
    When we arrived in Dien Bien Phu, the white wild plum blossoms on the surrounding mountains had already fallen. The evergreen mountains and fields, with the arrival of summer, appeared particularly lush and green. Even the mountains that had been scorched black by American-made napalm bombs last year had been covered with new greenery. Only a few places that were particularly badly damaged had not yet fully recovered.
    At almost this time last year, Dien Bien Phu was filled with smoke and the deafening sounds of cannons, bombs, and gunfire rang out day and night. Today, however, Dien Bien Phu is so peaceful that even the murmuring streams in the valleys, the singing of birds and cicadas in the thickets, and the joyous songs of the peculiar ape "choir" can be heard from afar.
    The jeep carried us along the steep mountain road where the Vietnamese People's Army artillery corps had moved at that time. Finally, we descended from the steep slope and entered the central area of Dien Bien Phu, more than 500 meters above sea level: the Muong Thanh Plain. This is the largest of the four famous mountain valley basins in northwestern Vietnam, 19 kilometers long and 9 kilometers wide, flat and open. The mountains surrounding the basin to the west and south form the border of Laos' Phongsaly and Luang Prabang provinces.
    Traces of the fierce battles that determined the entire Indochina situation can still be seen. In the center of the Muong Thanh Plain, next to the Nam Rom River, only a few pillars and a steel roof overturned on one side remain of De Castries' command post, indicating that it once existed. The airfield north of the "command post," the heavy artillery positions to the west, and the "A" hill fortress, the most solid of the group strongholds to the east, still show the wreckage of destroyed aircraft, heavily damaged 105 and 155 mm howitzers, and immobile tanks.
    Last year, the Vietnamese People's Army proactively filled in the communication trenches dug like spider webs to facilitate movement immediately after the battle in order to allow the people to resume production. Now, some sections of the communication trenches are still preserved in front of the barbed wire of the mountain strongholds left by the French aggressors, showing how the heroic Vietnamese People's Army passed through here to approach and eliminate the enemy.
    Snow-white monuments and memorial towers have been erected in the places where fierce battles once took place, and nearby are the tombs of the martyrs. With reverence, we paid our deep respects to the Vietnamese People's Army soldiers and guerrillas who shed their last drop of blood for the liberation of Dien Bien Phu, the liberation of their motherland, and the restoration of peace in Indochina.
    The car continued south and came to the Dien Bien Phu Administrative Committee and the location of the Vietnamese Labor Party County Committee – "New City." This urban area was newly established after the battle, located one kilometer southeast of the old Muong Thanh City. Rows of newly built bamboo houses are arranged in pairs along both sides of the road. This is the political, economic, and cultural center of Dien Bien Phu today. In addition to the county-level leading organs, a state-owned trading company, a medical station, and a primary school have also been newly established here. When we arrived, the representative conference of more than 12,000 people of various ethnic groups such as Thai, Hmong, Xa, and Lao in the county had just concluded. The conference elected eight representatives to attend the "Northwest Thai-Hmong Autonomous Region Establishment Conference" held in Thuan Chau County, Son La Province, on May 7. The remaining representatives stayed behind and were enthusiastically studying how to increase production and other issues.
    The production season in Dien Bien Phu is later than in other parts of the Northwest. Rice fields will be cultivated in June. Now the people are actively preparing seeds, farm tools, and repairing canals and sluice gates, or weeding in the cornfields in the mountains. Herds of white-haired or occasionally black-haired water buffaloes graze day and night unattended on the grasslands covered with pink "Bauhinia flowers," growing fat and strong. They will soon take on the arduous task of farming.
    The disasters that the war brought to the people of Dien Bien Phu were profound, but the people of Dien Bien Phu were not intimidated by the disasters. With the support of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government, they tenaciously rebuilt their peaceful lives. During the war, nearly 1,000 people from Dien Bien Phu were killed and captured by French aircraft and artillery, more than 800 water buffaloes were killed, 1,200 houses were demolished and burned, and large areas of farmland were forced to be abandoned... As soon as the war ended, the people of Dien Bien Phu came out of the enemy's concentration camps or returned from the forests, buried their relatives with tears, and united to help each other to build houses and cultivate the fields under extremely difficult conditions. According to statistics, since October last year, more than 500 houses have been built, and most of the county's arable land has been reclaimed and planted with crops.
    Last year, after the war, there was a severe drought, but the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government helped the people of Dien Bien Phu overcome the numerous disasters. In addition to sending cadres to lead the people in production and fight against the drought, the government also sent special vehicles to transport grain, salt, agricultural tools, seeds, and cloth, and has distributed 70 tons of rice and 3 tons of seeds. The government also sent medical personnel to help the people put out the dysentery brought by the French aggressors, which was rapidly spreading throughout Dien Bien Phu at that time.
    Today's Dien Bien Phu, although there are still many traces left over from the war, is full of the atmosphere of life everywhere.
    During our limited time in Dien Bien Phu, we had many opportunities to observe the lives of the people there from various perspectives. I will never forget the new villages rebuilt on the old sites, the three-kilometer-long canal that was abandoned for twelve years and rebuilt after the war, the increasing number of agricultural tools sold by the trading company, the groups of chickens and pigs jumping and scurrying under the stilt houses of the Thai people, the silkworms covered with black cloth spinning silk in baskets, the high-pitched reading voices of the children in the newly established literacy schools, the sound of women spinning and weaving at night, and the joyous singing and dancing of young men and women under the moonlight... All of this reminded people of the word "peace."
    The people of Dien Bien Phu especially cherish peace, and they are now working hard to restore and build their hometowns and to enhance the strength to defend peace. I remember when we visited a village called Ban Nong Nhai, the adults and children in the village ran out to greet us, invited us to sit in their homes, drink a cup of Thai tea, and then talked to us about the sad past and today's life and thoughts. During the Dien Bien Phu campaign, this village was used as a concentration camp by the French aggressors, who drove the surrounding people to live here in order to prevent the people from contacting the Vietnamese People's Army. When they were about to fail, the aggressors took even more vicious actions and bombed the masses concentrated in Ban Nong Nhai, killing and wounding more than 320 people in one bombing. In some families, only one person survived out of twenty-two people. In some families, all nine people died. The people of Ban Nong Nhai and Dien Bien Phu will always remember the inhumane atrocities of the aggressors. An old man in Ban Nong Nhai said: "Peace must be defended by our own hands!" The people of this village worked together to quickly repair a sluice gate, and are now preparing to spend nine days to repair two other sluice gates and three canals in order to respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to increase production and contribute to the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of the motherland.
    In Ban Tham Mon, we met an old couple surnamed Luo, both of whom were sixty years old. They live in a new house that was just repaired three months ago, raise three water buffaloes, three hens, and also brought a litter of chicks. They have also prepared all the grain seeds for farming this year. The old lady said: "I am happy in my heart because of peace, but I always forget my eldest son and daughter, and I can't forget the American thieves!" The old man said: "From bullets to airplanes and bombs, all were sent by American thieves. They bombed and killed my eighteen or nineteen-year-old son and my daughter who was about to get married!" After a long silence, the old man said:
  "The American thieves now want to overturn the Geneva Accords and destroy peace, and they will fail again like they did in Dien Bien Phu."
    On the day before the anniversary of the liberation of Dien Bien Phu, we left there. Sitting in the bumpy car, the words spoken by such an old man in such a remote place, which were also the voices from the bottom of the hearts of the people of Dien Bien Phu and all peace-loving people, kept lingering in my mind.

　　今日奠边府
　　——纪念奠边府解放一周年
　　本报驻越南记者　展潮
    我们到达奠边府的时候，奠边府周围群山上白色的野梅花已经凋落了。四季常青的山林和原野，随着夏天来临显得格外地葱绿，连去年被美国造的凝固汽油弹焚烧成一片焦黑的山岭，也披上了绿色的新装，只有几处受伤特别厉害的地方，还没有完全恢复过来。
    去年差不多这个时刻，奠边府正弥漫着硝烟，震耳的炮声、炸弹声和枪声日夜不停地轰响；而今，奠边府却是这样地宁静，连山涧里淙淙的流水，树丛里的鸟语蝉鸣，以及奇特的猿猴“合唱队”欢乐的歌声，在很远的地方都可以听得见。
    吉普车载着我们，沿着当时越南人民军炮队运动的险峻的山路前进，最后从陡斜的山坡下降，进入了拔海五百多公尺的奠边府中心地带：芒清平原。这是越南西北四个有名的山谷盆地中最大的一个，长十九公里，宽九公里，平坦、开阔。环列在盆地西面和南面的山峦，那就是老挝的丰沙里省和琅勃剌邦省的境界了。
    曾经发生过决定整个印度支那局势的激战的痕迹，现在还可以看得到。在芒清平原中心、约姆河旁边的德卡斯特莱的指挥所，现在只剩下几根柱子和翻倒在一边的钢顶，表示它曾经存在过。“指挥所”北边的飞机场，西边的重炮阵地，以及东边的集团据点中最坚固的“A”山头堡垒，还可以看到被打毁了的飞机残骸、受了重伤的一零五和一五五糎口径的榴弹炮、和不能动弹了的坦克车。
    去年，越南人民军为了便于运动所挖掘成密如蜘蛛网似的交通壕，战役刚一结束就主动地填平了，好让人民恢复生产。现在交通壕的某些段落，还在法国侵略军遗留下的山头堡垒的鹿砦跟前保存着，可以看得出英雄的越南人民军是怎样通过这里，去接近和消灭敌人的。
    在那些曾经发生过激烈战斗的地方，已经树立起雪白的纪念碑和纪念塔，附近是烈士们的墓冢。我们怀着崇敬的心情，向那些为解放奠边府、解放自己的祖国，为恢复印度支那和平而流尽最后一滴血的越南人民军战士和游击队员们，致以深深的悼念。
    车子继续南行，来到奠边府行政委员会和越南劳动党县委员所在地——“新市”。这个市区是在战役后新建立起来的，位于旧日芒清市东南一公里的地方。一座座新修筑的竹房成双行地毗邻地排列在汽车路两旁。这是奠边府今日的政治、经济和文化的中心，在这里除县级领导机关外，还新设立了一个国营贸易公司、一个医疗站和一座小学校。我们到的时候，代表全县一万二千多傣、苗、沙、寮等各族人民的代表大会刚开过，大会选出了八位代表去参加五月七日在山萝省顺州县召开的“西北傣、苗自治区成立大会”，其余许多代表都留下来，正在热心地研究怎样增加生产等问题。
    奠边府生产的季节比西北其他地方都要晚，稻田要到六月开耕，现在人民正积极准备种籽、农具，修建水渠、水闸，或者是到山上的玉米地里去锄草。成群的白毛或者偶尔有个别黑毛的水牛，无需人照管地日夜在开遍粉红色“苞汉花”的草地上放牧，养得肥胖壮实，它们不久就要担当繁重的耕作任务了。
    战争所给予奠边府人民的灾难是深重的，但是奠边府人民并没有被灾难吓倒，他们在越南劳动党和民主共和国政府的支持下，顽强地重新建立和平的生活。战争中，奠边府人民被法军飞机、大炮炸死的和被抓去的近一千人，水牛被杀死的八百多头，房屋被拆毁和烧掉的一千二百多座，大片田地被迫抛荒……。战争刚一结束，奠边府人民从敌人的集中寨里出来或者是从森林里回来，含着眼泪掩埋了自己的亲人，大伙团结互助，在极端困难的条件下把房子修起来，把田地耕种上。据统计，自去年十月份到现在，已经修筑起房子有五百多座，全县的耕地大部分已经重新得到开垦并种了庄稼。
    去年战争后，接着又是大旱，但是越南劳动党和民主共和国政府帮助奠边府人民渡过重重的灾难。政府除了派干部领导人民生产抗荒外，还派专车运来了粮食、食盐、农具、种籽和布匹，已发放的大米有七十吨，种籽有三吨。政府还派医务人员前来帮助人民扑灭了法国侵略军占领时带来的痢疾，这种病当时正迅速地向奠边府全境蔓延着。
    今日奠边府，虽然还有许多战时遗留下来的痕迹，但是已经到处都充满着生活的气息了。
    当我们在奠边府逗留的有限的时间里，曾经有许多机会从各个角度去观察那里人民的生活。我永远忘不了那一座座在旧址上重建起来的新村庄，那废弃了十二年而在大战后重修起来的三公里长的水渠，那贸易公司与日俱增的销售农具的数目字，那成群结队在傣族人高脚房舍下跳来窜去的鸡和猪，那被黑布蒙起来正在筐子里吐丝的山蚕，那新成立的启蒙学校里儿童们高亢的读书声，那夜间的妇女们纺纱织布声，那在月下青年男女们欢乐的歌舞……。所有这一切都叫人想起了“和平”两个字。
    对于和平，奠边府人民特别感到珍贵，他们现在正为恢复和建设自己的家乡、为增强保卫和平的力量在努力着。记得我们去访问一个叫版侬崖的村子时，村子里的大人小孩子都跑出来迎接我们，让到他们家里去坐，喝一杯傣族人的茶水，然后同我们谈起悲伤的往事和今天的生活、思想。奠边府战役时，这个村曾经被法国侵略军作为集中寨，把周围的群众都赶到这里来聚居，以防止人民和越南人民军联络，临近失败时，侵略军更下了毒手，对集中在版侬崖的群众大肆轰炸，一次就炸死炸伤了三百二十多人，有的一家二十二口人只有一个人活着。有的一家九口人全死绝了。对于侵略者这种灭绝人性的暴行，版侬崖和奠边府人民永远都记在心里。版侬崖一位老人说：“和平要靠我们用双手来保卫！”这个村子的人齐心合力地很快就把一个水闸修好了，现在还准备用九天时间修好另外两个水闸和三条水渠，以便响应胡志明主席的号召，增加生产、为祖国的和平、统一、独立和民主贡献力量。
    在版参门，我们遇到一对姓罗的老夫妇，两个人都六十岁了。他们住在刚修好三个月的新房子里，养着三头水牛、三只母鸡还带了一窝小鸡，今年种田的谷种也准备齐全了。老太太说：“和平了，心里高兴，就是总忘不了我的大儿子和女儿，也忘不了美国贼！”老头子说：“从子弹到飞机、炸弹都是美国贼送来的，它炸死了我十八九岁的儿子和快出嫁的女儿！”沉默了半晌，老头子说：
  “美国贼现在又想推翻日内瓦协定，破坏和平，它又要像在奠边府一样失败的。”
    在奠边府解放周年的前一天，我们离开了那里。坐在颠簸前进的车子上，我脑子里老是萦回着在这样边远的地方，从这样的老人口里说出的这些话，也是出自奠边府和一切爱好和平人民心底里的声音。
