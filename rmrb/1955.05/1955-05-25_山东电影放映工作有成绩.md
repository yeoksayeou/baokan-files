　　Shandong Film Projection Work Achieves Success

　　Film projection units in Shandong Province have developed to 194. In 1954, they projected films a total of 55,230 times, with an audience of more than 59,540,000 people. Among these, 88 film projection teams regularly tour and project films in rural areas, mountainous regions, and on lakes.

　　Before 1950, no films had been projected in rural Shandong, and peasants regarded watching movies as a myth. Therefore, film teams were warmly welcomed and treated wherever they went. Peasants in Da'an Township, Fei County, crossed seven or eight mountains to meet the film team twenty miles away, helping to carry machines and luggage. On Weishan Lake, whenever the screen was set up on the water, families rowed their fishing boats over. They said with emotion: "In the Kuomintang era, we couldn't even get enough to eat, and we never dreamed of being able to watch movies. Now, not only do we have food and clothing, but the government also brings movies to the lake."

　　山东电影放映工作有成绩
    山东省电影放映单位已发展到一百九十四个，在一九五四年一年中，共放映了电影五万五千二百三十场，观众达五千九百五十四万多人次；其中有八十八个电影放映小队经常在农村、山区、湖上巡回放映。
    一九五○年以前，山东农村里还没有放映过一部电影，农民把看电影当作神话一样。因此，电影队每到一个地方，都受到群众的热烈欢迎和招待。费县大安乡的农民翻过七八个山头到二十里外的地方去接电影队，帮助抬机器搬行李。在微山湖，每当银幕插在水上的时候，一家家的人划着渔船纷纷赶来，他们感动地说：“在国民党时代，连顿饱饭都捞不着，作梦也想不到能看上电影；现在，不仅有吃有穿，政府还把电影送到湖上来。”
