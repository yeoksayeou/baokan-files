    For Building a Prosperous and Happy New Society
　　Call to Action Passed by the All-Union Conference of Industrial Workers
  Moscow newspapers published on the 22nd the Call to Action passed by the All-Union Conference of Industrial Workers recently held in Moscow.
    The Call to Action pointed out that the conference participants proudly noted the tremendous achievements of the Soviet Union in developing its national economy. This year, Soviet industrial production will exceed the 1950 level by 80 percent, more than three times the pre-war level. The powerful upsurge of heavy industry has enabled the further development of light industry and agriculture, the strengthening of the country's defense capabilities, and the continuous improvement of the material well-being of the working people.
    Complex tasks in the use of atomic energy are being successfully solved. The Soviet Union was the first in the world to start using atomic energy for peaceful purposes.
    The conference participants called on the staff of all industrial sectors to unremittingly improve labor productivity, more rapidly disseminate and implement the advanced experience of outstanding enterprises and production innovators in production, and strive to increase output on existing production areas and on each piece of equipment, and increase the quantity of high-quality products per worker.
      The Call to Action also called on scientific and technical workers, engineers and technicians of industrial enterprises, inventors and innovators in the relevant departments to step up their work and actively promote scientific discoveries and technological achievements in production. It is particularly important to more quickly solve the tasks of overall mechanization and automation of production processes.
    The Call to Action concluded by saying that the strength of the Soviet motherland and the welfare of the Soviet people depend on the achievements of industrial development, and first of all on the achievements of the development of its foundation - heavy industry. We call on all male and female workers, engineers, technicians and managers of industrial enterprises to launch a broader socialist competition and strive to fulfill the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan and the 1955 National Plan ahead of schedule.

    利用原子能方面的复杂任务正在成功地解决。苏联在世界上头一个开始把原子能用于和平用途。
    会议参加者号召各工业部门的工作人员不懈地提高劳动生产率，更迅速地在生产中传播和推行优秀企业和生产革新者的先进经验，努力争取在现有的生产面积上和每一部设备上增加产量，提高按每一个工作人员平均计算的优质产品的数量。
      号召书并号召各有关部门的科学技术工作者、工业企业的工程师和技术员、发明者和革新者加紧工作，积极地在生产中推行科学发现和技术成就。特别重要的是，更迅速地解决全盘机械化和生产过程自动化的任务。
    号召书最后说，苏维埃祖国的威力和苏联人民的福利，决定于工业发展的成就，首先决定于它的基础——重工业——发展的成就。我们号召工业企业全体男女工人、工程师、技术员和管理人员更广泛地展开社会主义竞赛，争取提前完成第五个五年计划和一九五五年国家计划的任务。
