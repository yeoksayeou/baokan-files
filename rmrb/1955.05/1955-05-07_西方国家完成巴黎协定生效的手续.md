Xinhua News Agency, 6th. British and French High Commissioners in Bonn, representing their respective governments, deposited in Bonn on the 5th the instruments of ratification of the so-called "Protocol on the Termination of the Occupation Regime (in West Germany)" of the Paris Agreements.

On the same day, representatives of the governments of France, Britain and West Germany deposited in Brussels the instruments of ratification of the Paris Agreements on the establishment of the "Western European Union"; West Germany and France exchanged notes on the entry into force of the Franco-West German Saar Agreement.

With the above-mentioned actions of depositing the instruments of ratification, the procedures for ratifying and bringing the Paris Agreements into effect have been completed. This means that the Western countries and the Bonn government have taken another step forward on the road of deepening the division of Germany.

The Western countries and the Bonn government took this final action in a hurry. The U.S. government and the Bonn government first deposited the instruments of ratification of the two documents of the Paris Agreements on April 20, and then exerted various pressures on Britain, especially on France, forcing them to imitate the example of the United States and Bonn as soon as possible.

　　西方国家完成巴黎协定生效的手续
    新华社六日讯　英国和法国驻波恩高级专员五日代表两国政府在波恩交存巴黎协定中所谓“关于结束（在西德）占领制度议定书”的批准书。
    同一天，法国、英国和西德三国政府代表在布鲁塞尔交存了关于成立“西欧联盟”的巴黎协定的批准书；西德和法国交换了关于确定法国—西德间的萨尔协定开始生效的照会。
    由于上述交存批准书的行动，批准并使巴黎协定生效的手续已经完成。这意味着西方国家和波恩政府在加深德国分裂的道路上又前进了一步。
    西方国家和波恩政府是在急急忙忙的情况下采取这个最后行动的。美国政府和波恩政府首先在四月二十日交存了巴黎协定两项文件的批准书随后就对英国、特别是对法国施加了各种压力，强迫它们尽快地仿效美国和波恩的榜样。
