Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 18th: Indian newspapers on the 18th prominently published Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the Asian-African Conference, delivered at the session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China.

    "Indian Express," in its editorial, supported the just demand of the Chinese people for the liberation of Taiwan. The editorial stated that no one could disagree that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and that the people of Taiwan and the solutions concerning their future are China's internal affairs. Referring to Premier Zhou Enlai's statement at the Asian-African Conference regarding easing tensions in the Far East, particularly in the Taiwan area, the editorial said that Premier Zhou Enlai's argument that the American people are friendly to the Chinese people, that there is no war between China and the United States, and that there is no so-called ceasefire issue is irrefutable.

    Bombay's "Free Press Journal," commenting on Premier Zhou's position on the Taiwan issue in his report, said that it is difficult to find any fault with China's position.

　　印度报纸评周总理关于亚非会议的报告
    新华社新德里十八日电　印度报纸十八日普遍以显著地位刊载了周恩来总理在中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会会议上所作的关于亚非会议的报告。
    “印度快报”在社论中支持中国人民解放台湾的正义要求。社论说，没有人能够不同意台湾是中国的领土，台湾的人民和有关他们前途的解决办法是中国的内政问题。台湾问题弄到现在这种地步，是由于美国的干涉。在谈到周恩来总理在亚非会议上提出的关于和缓远东紧张局势特别是台湾地区紧张局势的声明时，社论说，周恩来总理所说的美国人民同中国人民是友好的，中美之间并没有战争，也不发生所谓停火问题的论点是无可辩驳的。
    孟买的“自由新闻”在评论周总理报告中关于台湾问题的立场时说，从中国的立场中是很难找到任何差错的。
