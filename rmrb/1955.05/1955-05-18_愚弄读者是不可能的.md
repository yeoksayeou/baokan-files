　　It is Impossible to Fool the Readers
　　Pan Yifan
　　After reading the "Some Materials Concerning the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" and Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" in the People's Daily on May 13th, as a student of the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute, I cannot but express my extreme indignation at Hu Feng's hypocritical "self-criticism."
　　For more than ten years, Hu Feng has been standing on the anti-Party stand, attacking the Party and the progressive literary ranks led by the Party. He called the progressive writer Mao Dun a "rising philistine," and referred to the comrades working in the Party's literary field as "officials," "imperial envoys," "dignitaries," and "young masters." He called the "People's Daily's" criticism of A Long's literary thought an "attack," and regarded attending the Lu Xun commemoration meeting as a "disaster" and "extremely boring." He even resorted to despicable means to use the supplements in reactionary newspapers and periodicals to establish "coordinating strongholds" for it, attempting to use this to encircle and suppress the progressive literary ranks led by the Party at that time, in order to achieve Hu Feng's personal ambition of "taking the world as his responsibility." All these materials show how Hu Feng has degenerated into the quagmire of an anti-Party sectarian clique.
　　Let's take a look at Hu Feng's so-called "My Self-Criticism"! This is simply not a self-criticism, but a defense, an attempt to fool the readers. Look how "respectful" Hu Feng is to the Party! "If it were not for the revolution and the Communist Party of China, I personally would not have found a place to settle down in the past twenty years." But compare this with the letter he wrote to Shu Wu: he wanted to "charge" the Party's literary ranks, and "be determined to coexist with the position." How can such a false self-criticism deceive people? Hu Feng has been attacking the Party for more than ten years, but now he is trying to cover it up with a few light-hearted words, saying that "regarding the Party's political demands represented by the comrades in Hong Kong as 'the other shore' and mocking them" - is it just mocking? Not only mocking, but also malicious attacks, insults, and even treating them as "enemies," regarding the well-intentioned advice to him to go to Hong Kong to transfer to the liberated areas as "coercion," and adopting "cluster grenade tactics" against the progressive literary ranks. This can only show that Hu Feng's "self-criticism" is a completely false self-criticism, and he has no intention of truly repenting.
　　We want to solemnly tell Hu Feng, stop playing tricks on the Party. Since you know that your self-criticism "must be not profound and not comprehensive," then why not conduct a more profound and more comprehensive self-criticism? Therefore, the problem is not that it is not profound, but whether you have the sincere intention to repent. We want to remind Hu Feng that he should make a self-criticism like Shu Wu, and only such a self-criticism is welcomed by the people. All hypocritical false self-criticisms will not only fail to be welcomed by the people, but will also cause great indignation among the people. The eyes of the people are discerning, and Hu Feng's mask will absolutely not deceive people.

### 愚弄读者是不可能的

　  愚弄读者是不可能的
    潘一凡
    看了五月十三日人民日报的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”和胡风的“我的自我批判”后，作为北京钢铁学院的一个学生的我，不能不对胡风这种虚伪的“检讨”表示极大的愤慨。
    胡风在十多年来一直是站在反党的立场上，攻击党和党所领导的进步文学队伍。他把进步的作家茅盾称作“抬头的市侩”，把党在文艺方面的工作同志说成是“官们”“钦差”“权贵”“老爷们”
  “公子们”，把当时“人民日报”对阿垅文艺思想的批评说成是“讨伐”，把参加鲁迅纪念会看作是
  “灾难”“无聊之至”，甚至不惜采取卑鄙的手段利用反动报刊上的副刊为它建立“配合的小据点”，企图借此来围剿当时党所领导的进步文学队伍，以达到胡风的“以天下为己任”的个人野心目的。这一切材料都说明了胡风是怎样堕落到反党的宗派小集团的泥坑中去了。
    再看看胡风的所谓“我的自我批判”吧！这简直不是在检讨，而是在辩护，在愚弄读者。你看胡风对党是多么“崇敬”呵！“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的”。但是对照一下他写给舒芜的信：他要向党的文学队伍进行“冲锋”，要“抱着与阵地共存亡的决心”。这种虚假的检讨怎么能骗得过人呢？胡风十几年来对党进攻，现在却企图用轻描淡写的几句话掩盖过去，说“把香港的同志们所代表的党的政治要求说成‘彼岸’，加以嘲笑”，难道仅仅是嘲笑吗？不仅嘲笑，而且是恶意的攻击，谩骂，甚至当作“敌人”来看待，把好意的劝他到香港转解放区说成是“逼”，对进步文学队伍采取“集束手榴弹的战术”，这只能说明胡风的“检讨”是彻头彻尾的假检讨，是不想真心悔改。
    我们要正告胡风，不要再向党玩弄把戏了，既然晓得自己的检讨“一定是不深刻，不全面的”，那为什么不更深刻，更全面地进行自我批判呢？所以，问题不在于不深刻，问题在于自己是否有真诚悔改之意。我们要提醒胡风，应该像舒芜那样的检讨，也只有这样的检讨才是人民所欢迎的，一切虚伪的假检讨，不但不能得到人民的欢迎，而且会引起人民极大的愤慨。人民的眼睛是雪亮的，胡风的假面具是绝对骗不了人的。
