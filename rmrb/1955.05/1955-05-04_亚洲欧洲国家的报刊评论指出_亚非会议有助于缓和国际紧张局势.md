Xinhua News Agency report: Newspapers in Asian and European countries widely comment on the significance of the Asian-African Conference.

　　India
　　The Indian Hindi weekly "Justice" said in a commentary on the results of the Asian-African Conference, "Who could have imagined that the Asian and African countries, which have been subjected to imperialist exploitation and oppression for the past two centuries, could show themselves on the international stage in this way?" The commentary said that the decision to hold the Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries was warmly welcomed by the world. But this does not mean that the governments of all countries are happy about this conference. For example, "Chicago Sun-Times" said on January 3, "According to the Eisenhower leadership group, from the American point of view, the upcoming Asian-African Conference is completely unwelcome." This is very natural. If Asian and African countries now strengthen their cooperation, the plans of the imperialist elements will be defeated.
　　The "Leader" newspaper published an editorial on the 27th saying that the resolutions passed by the Asian-African Conference "are a slap in the face to those who advocate Asians fighting Asians."
　　The "Delhi Times" weekly wrote in an editorial on April 29, "The East is now united against colonial exploitation. The Bandung Declaration is a declaration against the crimes of imperialist countries." The editorial said that the Asian-African Conference "has certainly achieved something in easing the world situation and easing tensions in Southeast Asia."
　　The editorial praised the Chinese delegation's contribution to the Asian-African Conference, saying that the attitude adopted by Premier Zhou Enlai helped the conference achieve unity.
　　Burma
　　The "Burma New Light" published an editorial on April 27, supporting the joint communiqué of the Asian-African Conference. The editorial said that the results of the Asian-African Conference are satisfactory, and the agreement reached on the issue of opposing colonialism is particularly worthy of attention.
　　The editorial emphasized that the conference's resolution on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons and the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes not only meets the requirements of the people of the twenty-nine Asian and African countries, but is also welcomed by the people of the world.
　　The editorial said that it was the first time in history that the twenty-nine countries of Asia and Africa, which have more than half of the world's population, had held such a conference.
　　Indonesia
　　The Indonesian weekly "Sunday Courier" published an editorial on May 1, saying that despite various obstructions and sabotage by reactionaries, the Asian-African Conference passed resolutions worthy of pride.
　　The editorial said that the principles put forward by the conference to defend world peace are effective contributions to the cause of peace. If the efforts made at the conference are fully implemented, then Asian and African countries will make progress.
　　The editorial pointed out that the unanimous adoption of the conference's resolutions shows the strength of the people's struggle for peace and freedom, and is also a heavy blow to the imperialist war forces.
　　Pakistan
　　The Karachi "Today" newspaper in Pakistan published an editorial on April 28 saying: Despite attempts by certain imperialist countries to undermine it, the Asian-African Conference finally ended victoriously in an atmosphere of unity and friendship. This fact makes the broad masses of people in Asia and Africa rejoice. That Asian and African countries can put aside their differences and work together to strive for freedom, peace and a prosperous life is a warning to the colonialists.
　　The editorial also said that the Asian-African Conference itself is the best example of peaceful coexistence. Countries participating in military blocs planned by the United States against the Soviet Union and China should reconsider whether their policies are in line with the spirit of the Asian-African Conference resolutions regarding not serving the special interests of great powers.
　　Romania
　　The Romanian "Spark" newspaper published a commentary on April 27, discussing the results of the Asian-African Conference. The commentary said that the achievement of the Asian-African Conference lies first of all in its establishment and consolidation of understanding between Asian and African countries. It shows that the people of Asia and Africa have consistent opinions in defending peace, advocating international cooperation, and opposing the colonialist system. The commentary believes that the ten principles in the joint communiqué issued after the meeting on promoting world peace and cooperation "are in line with the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world."
　　The commentary praised the Chinese delegation's contribution to the conference. The commentary also pointed out that the treaty signed between China and Indonesia on the issue of dual nationality illustrates China's sincerity in striving for peaceful coexistence, striving for international cooperation, and advocating the settlement of all international disputes through negotiations.
　　France
　　The French "Humanity" published a commentary on April 25 entitled "The Victory of the Unity of the People of All Countries," welcoming the achievements of the Asian-African Conference.
　　The commentary said that the joint communiqué of the Asian-African Conference is a victorious summary. Despite repeated attempts by saboteurs to provoke ideological conflicts unrelated to the issues under discussion, the conference reached agreement on all major issues. The commentary said that American observers, reporters, and pseudo-reporters who went to Bandung hoping to see the break-up of Asian and African countries were wasting their efforts.
　　The commentary said that the coincidence of interests of Asian and African countries in the issues of colonialism, racism, economic and cultural cooperation, the right of self-determination of the people of all countries, and the struggle for peace outweighs the differences in political systems and political concepts. This is a fact of great historical significance.
　　West Germany
　　The German Communist Party's organ "Free People's Daily" commented on the achievements of the Asian-African Conference on April 26, saying that the convening of the Asian-African Conference shows that the era in which foreign forces decided the vital issues of the Asian and African people has passed. The achievements of the conference prove that the Asian and African people can take their destiny into their own hands, and also prove that the Asian and African people firmly support the five principles of peaceful coexistence.
　　The commentary said that Washington had tried its best to use various means to provoke the countries participating in the conference, attempting to cause disputes and create divisions. However, Washington's conspiracy failed.
　　West Germany's "German People's Daily" said on April 30 that the successful conclusion of the Asian-African Conference is a powerful blow to the policy of strength and a lesson to the West. The newspaper believes that the impact of the Asian-African Conference on the entire world will be demonstrated in the near future.
　　The newspaper said that a lesson for Germany from the conference is that Germany should also conduct consultations like the Asian and African countries to decide its own destiny.
　　West Germany's "South German Weekly" also believes that the Asian-African Conference is a historically significant conference in the political life of Asian and African countries.
　　Austria
　　The Austrian Communist Party's organ "Voice of the Austrian People" commented on the achievements of the Asian-African Conference on April 26, saying that the United States' attempt to expand the differences between the participating countries and undermine the conference failed. The communiqué of the conference is an recognition of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, and also a declaration against the policy of strength.
　　The newspaper said that for the first time, Asia and Africa have gathered together as independent actors, and this will have a significant impact. The will for peace and unity of the Asian and African people demonstrated at the conference is much stronger than the conspiracy of American imperialism.

### 亚洲欧洲国家的报刊评论指出　亚非会议有助于缓和国际紧张局势

　　亚洲欧洲国家的报刊评论指出
　　亚非会议有助于缓和国际紧张局势
　　据新华社讯　亚洲、欧洲各国报刊广泛评论亚非会议的意义。
　　印度
    印度的印地文“公理”周刊在一篇关于亚非会议的结果的评论中说，“在若干年以前，有谁能够想像，最近两世纪来一直遭受着帝国主义剥削和压迫的亚非国家能够在国际舞台上这样显露头角呢？”评论说，召开亚非国家万隆会议的决定受到全世界的热烈欢迎。但是这并不是说所有国家的政府都对这次会议表示高兴。例如“芝加哥太阳时报”在一月三日就这样说过：“据艾森豪威尔领导集团的意见，从美国的观点来看，即将举行的亚非会议完全是不受欢迎的。”这是非常自然的。如果现在亚非国家加强它们的合作，帝国主义分子的计划就将被击败。
    “领袖报”二十七日发表社论说，亚非会议所通过的决议“是对那些主张亚洲人打亚洲人的人们的一记耳光”。
    “德里时代”周刊四月二十九日的社论写道，“东方现在已经团结一致反对殖民剥削。万隆宣言就是反对帝国主义国家的罪行的宣言。”社论说，亚非会议“在缓和世界局势和缓和东南亚紧张局势方面肯定是有成就的。”
    社论赞扬中国代表团对亚非会议的贡献说，周恩来总理所采取的态度帮助会议取得了团结一致。
　　缅甸
    “缅甸新光报”四月二十七日发表社论，拥护亚非会议的联合公报。社论说，亚非会议的成果是令人满意的，在反对殖民主义问题上取得的协议，是特别值得重视的。
    社论着重说，会议关于禁止使用核子武器和发展核子能的和平用途问题的决议，不仅符合亚非二十九个国家的人民的要求，而且也是全世界人民所欢迎的。
    社论说，拥有世界人口一半以上的亚非两洲的二十九个国家进行这样的会议，在历史上还是第一次。
　　印度尼西亚
    印度尼西亚“星期日信使”周刊在五月一日发表社论说，尽管反动派进行了各种各样的阻挠和破坏，亚非会议还是通过了值得引以自豪的各项决议。
    社论说，会议所拟出的保卫世界和平的各项原则对和平事业是有效的贡献。如果会议上所作的努力得到充分贯彻的话，那末亚非国家将取得进展。
    社论指出，一致通过会议的各项决议这一点，表明了人民争取和平与自由的力量，同时也是对帝国主义战争力量的沉重的打击。
　　巴基斯坦
    巴基斯坦喀喇蚩“今天报”四月二十八日发表社论说：尽管某些帝国主义国家企图破坏，亚非会议终于在团结友好的气氛中胜利结束，这一事实使得亚洲和非洲广大人民欢欣鼓舞。亚非各国能够撇开彼此间的差异，共同为争取自由、和平和繁荣的生活而努力，这是对殖民主义者的一个警告。
    社论又说，亚非会议本身就是和平共处的最好例证。参加美国所策划的反对苏联和中国的军事集团的国家，应该重新考虑它们的政策是否合乎亚非会议决议中关于不为大国特殊利益服务的规定的精神。
　　罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚“火花报”四月二十七日发表评论，论述亚非会议的结果。评论说，亚非会议的成就首先在于它建立和巩固了亚非国家间的了解。它显示出亚非人民在保卫和平，主张国际合作和反对殖民主义制度方面有着一致的意见。评论认为，会后发表的联合公报中关于促进世界和平和合作的十项原则“是符合全世界爱好和平人民的愿望的”。
    评论赞扬中国代表团对会议的贡献。评论并指出，中国和印度尼西亚签订的关于双重国籍问题的条约说明中国在争取和平共处，争取国际合作和主张用谈判方式解决一切国际争端方面的诚意。
　　法国
    法国“人道报”四月二十五日以“各国人民团结的胜利”为题发表评论，欢迎亚非会议的成就。
    评论说，亚非会议的联合公报是一个胜利的总结。尽管有破坏者屡次试图挑起同讨论的问题无关的思想意识的冲突，但是会议在一切重大问题上都达成了协议。评论说，到万隆去一心指望看到亚非各国破裂的美国观察家、记者以及冒牌的记者们，结果是白费了力气。
    评论说，亚非各国无论在殖民主义问题上，种族主义问题上，经济和文化合作问题上，各国人民自决权问题上和争取和平的斗争问题上，利益的一致都超过了政治制度和政治观念的分歧。这就是一个具有重大历史意义的事实。
　　西德
    德国共产党机关报“自由人民报”四月二十六日评论亚非会议的成就说，亚非会议的召开表明，外国势力决定亚非人民切身问题的时代已经过去了。会议的成就证明了亚非人民能够把他们的命运掌握在自己手中，也证明了亚非人民坚定不移地拥护和平共处的五项原则。
    评论说，华盛顿方面曾竭力用各种手段来挑拨参加会议的各个国家，企图引起争端，制造分裂。但是，华盛顿方面的这个阴谋遭到了失败。
    西德的“德国人民报”四月三十日说，亚非会议的胜利结束是对实力政策的一个有力的打击，同时也是对西方的一个教训。报纸认为亚非会议对整个世界的影响将在不久的将来表现出来。
    报纸说，会议对德国的一个教训是德国也应该像亚非国家一样进行协商，来决定自己的命运。
    西德的“南德意志周报”也认为亚非会议是亚洲和非洲各国政治生活中一个有历史意义的会议。
    奥地利
    奥地利共产党机关报“奥地利人民之声报”四月二十六日评亚非会议的成就说，美国扩大与会国之间的分歧、破坏会议的企图失败了。会议的公报是对和平共处五项原则的承认，同时也是反对实力政策的一个声明。
    报纸说，亚非两洲第一次作为独立行动的因素聚集在一起，这件事将产生重大的影响。在会议上所表现出来的亚非人民的和平意志和团结要比美帝国主义的阴谋强大得多。
