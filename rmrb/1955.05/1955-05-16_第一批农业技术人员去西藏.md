    The First Group of Agricultural Technicians Go to Tibet
    In order to develop agricultural production in the Tibetan region, the Ministry of Agriculture has sent nine technicians there to assist in the work. This is the first group of agricultural technicians to go to Tibet. They departed from Beijing on May 12th.
    These cadres were drawn from agricultural scientific research institutions in North China, East China, Northeast China, and other regions, and possess scientific knowledge in agronomy, horticulture, soil science, and fertilizers. In order to support national construction, they were the first to respond to the call of the Party and the government to go to work in Tibet.
    On the eve of their departure (May 11th), the Ministry of Agriculture also held a farewell meeting for them. At the meeting, they all expressed their determination to overcome all difficulties, contribute all their strength, and build Tibet into an even more beautiful place.

　  第一批农业技术人员去西藏
    为了发展西藏地区的农业生产，农业部派出九名技术人员到那里去协助工作。这是农业技术人员去西藏的第一批。他们已在五月十二日从北京出发。
    这些干部都是从华北、华东、东北等农业科学研究机关抽调出来的，具有农艺、园艺、土壤、肥料等科学知识。他们为了支援国家建设，首先响应了党和政府的号召前去西藏工作。
    出发前夕（五月十一日）农业部还为他们举行了欢送会。会上，他们都表示要克服一切困难，贡献出自己所有的力量，把西藏建设得更美丽。
