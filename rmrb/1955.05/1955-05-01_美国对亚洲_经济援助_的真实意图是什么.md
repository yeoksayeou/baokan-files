What is the Real Intention of US "Economic Aid" to Asia?
　　Zhao Wen
　　Recently, in order to lure certain countries participating in the Asian-African Conference, US officials and their propaganda organs have intensified their promotion of the US increasing its "economic aid" to Asia to help the region's underdeveloped countries develop their economies and improve their living standards. However, many facts about US economic "aid" to underdeveloped regions only illustrate the unchanging policy of US monopoly capital to make economically backward countries become appendages of the US economy. US monopoly groups have always relied on this economic "aid" to seize various privileges from the "recipient" countries, including raw material supply, trade preferences, resource surveys and development, interference in economic affairs and financial finance, and many other harsh conditions that damage the economy and sovereignty of the "recipient" countries. There are many examples of US monopoly capital using "aid" to blackmail and control "recipient" countries. For example, when India's famine was severe in 1951, the United States, under the guise of "emergency food aid," repeatedly forced the Indian government to agree to repay most of the US loans with strategic materials and other important raw materials; in 1952, when India urgently needed funds to alleviate the famine, the United States suddenly reduced its orders for India's jute and other major export goods, which caused great difficulties for the Indian economy.
　　The US government's foreign economic and technical assistance is stipulated to be used to stimulate the development of US private capital in underdeveloped regions. What US private capital is most interested in in underdeveloped regions is: obtaining super-investment profits in these regions, and seizing and controlling raw material markets and commodity markets urgently needed by the United States through investment. Wall Street monopoly groups have never intended to use their surplus capital to truly help develop the industry of backward countries. They believe that the industrialization of backward countries directly conflicts with their monopoly interests. Therefore, they are not only not interested in the industrialization plans of backward countries, but also systematically hinder them. The famous "International Chamber of Commerce," which regularly formulates US monopoly capital's foreign expansion policies, stated in a document published as early as 1947 that the economic activities related to foreign investment are determined by foreign investors rather than the recipient country. The document stated that if the government of a backward country believes that "building a steel plant is more important than building many factories that manufacture consumer goods," US capital may "find the climate there unfavorable for foreign investment." Former US Secretary of State Acheson made a clearer statement in the US Senate in 1950. He said: "It is not true to think that we are going to build large factories and mines for the people in underdeveloped areas." A technical delegation sent by the US State Department to Brazil stated in an official report in 1950 a basic consideration of US monopoly capital on the industrialization of backward countries: Since the "Point Four Program" (a program that the United States once vigorously promoted to "aid" backward countries) was formulated based on the purpose of "moderating the conflict between the speed of foreign economic development and the US economy," the United States must be prepared to "guide the inevitable industrialization of backward countries." If this industrialization "is not controlled in a way like the Point Four Program, it means that the scope of the US export market will be greatly reduced."
　　However, strengthening economic plunder of backward countries is not the only purpose of US monopoly capital providing economic "aid." This "aid" is also increasingly becoming an important tool for the United States to achieve its military aggression and war preparations. US economic "aid" to Asia almost began with the distinct nature of serving the purpose of military aggression. After the US aggressive group launched the Korean War, it intensified the creation of tension in Asia and prepared for new wars. The US foreign aid plan directly served this purpose. Truman's "Mutual Security Act" message called US foreign military and economic aid "a component of our own armed forces." The "Mutual Security Act" stipulates that countries receiving US "aid" must undertake the military obligations stipulated in the agreement. According to the US plan, countries receiving "aid" must establish and expand local Asian troops as part of the US armed forces, and carry out other heinous activities in preparation for aggressive wars under the unified plan of the US Department of Defense. The US State Department's approach is to first allow Asian countries to accept economic aid, and then try to get them to accept military aid. The United States signed a "Technical Assistance Agreement" with Pakistan in 1951, and then signed two economic aid agreements, and in 1954, it signed the US-Pakistan military aid agreement. Thailand accepted US economic aid in September 1950, and accepted military aid in October of the same year. As everyone knows, Washington has repeatedly attempted to force Indonesia, Burma, and India to continue accepting military aid after accepting economic aid. The United States intends to drag Asian countries into the US aggressive military bloc through this "aid" to realize its aggressive plan of "Asians fighting Asians." In 1952, the US government simply incorporated the "Point Four Program" into the "Mutual Security Program," which shows the military intention of US economic and technical "aid." The US "New Republic" magazine wrote at the time: The passage of the "Mutual Security Program" put the "Point Four Program" in military uniform. Truman said in his message on the "Mutual Security Act" that the economic assistance he requested was "mainly used to support the expanded defense efforts abroad."
　　After the Korean armistice, the US aggressive group proposed to develop "regional economy" in Asia. This is in line with the activities of the United States, which had begun to actively organize military groups in Asia and piece together the "Pacific Pact." Economic aid to Asia is to move from bilateral arrangements to "regional economy" to lay the foundation for the final establishment of military groups. After Stassen, director of the US Foreign Operations Administration, visited the Far East in February and March last year, he revealed that the United States had planned to establish an Asian "regional expert organization" similar to the "European Economic Cooperation Agency" at that time. According to the plan of the Washington war group, this Asian "regional economy" organization is to "integrate" the economies of Japan and some other Asian countries, and then conclude an agreement in Asia similar to the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization," so that the United States can be on both sides of the peaceful and democratic camp—Europe and Asia— There is an aggressive military group, forming a situation of突击, and the revived militarist forces of Germany and Japan will become the core forces in these two groups.
　　After the Geneva Conference, the US war group hurriedly pieced together the "Southeast Asia Defense Group" in Asia, and its military aggressive nature of economic aid became even more obvious. At that time, a message from Washington by Kyodo News Agency of Japan said: The US government intends to strengthen military and economic assistance to "anti-communist countries such as Japan" to "maintain a new Far East military plan to confront Communist China" and implement "the so-called Asians fighting Asians strategic plan of the current US government."
　　The first concrete step of this military adventure plan of the US aggressive group in terms of economic aid is to place the proposed Asian economic organization similar to the "European Economic Cooperation Agency" directly under the "Southeast Asia Defense Group." The US aggressive group believes that in this way, it can use economic aid to lure some Asian countries that are still refusing to participate in the US military group into it. According to the "New York Times," Washington's idea is that "through this type of organization, neutralists may be brought into some form of cooperative relationship in Southeast Asian defense. Japan may eventually be included, although other Asians fear this."
　　In Eisenhower's recently proposed 1956 foreign aid plan, there is a $200 million appropriation for "the President's special funds for Asian economic development," which is designated for "regional economy." The United States is currently working to realize the sinister purpose revealed by the "New York Times" of dragging some Asian countries that have adopted independent and autonomous policies into military aggressive groups through this "regional economy" organization.
　　Asian countries need to develop their economies, but what they need is the normal development of their own economies in a peaceful environment and under the conditions of sincere international cooperation, to get rid of colonial plunder and exploitation. The predatory and aggressive foreign "aid" policy of the US aggressive group is obviously incompatible with this desire of the people of Asian countries.

　　美国对亚洲“经济援助”的真实意图是什么
　　赵文
    最近以来，美国官方和它的宣传机关为了对参加亚非会议的某些国家进行利诱，加紧宣传美国将增加对亚洲的“经济援助”，来帮助这一地区落后国家发展经济，提高生活水平。但是美国对落后地区经济“援助”的许多事实，只是说明了美国垄断资本的不变的政策是要使经济落后的国家成为美国经济的附属体。美国垄断集团一贯依靠这种经济
  “援助”从受“援”国家攫取各方面的特权，包括原料供应、贸易特惠、资源的调查和开发、经济事务和财政金融的干涉，以及其他许多损害受
  “援”国经济和主权的苛刻条件。美国垄断资本利用“援助”对受“援”国进行敲诈和控制，是有很多实例的。例如当一九五一年印度粮荒严重时，美国在“紧急粮食援助”的名目下，曾一再逼迫印度政府答应用战略物资和其他重要原料来偿还美国贷款的大部分；一九五二年当印度正需要资金来缓和粮荒时，美国又突然减少了对印度黄麻等多种主要出口货的订购，曾使印度经济遭受很大困难。
    美国政府的对外经济技术援助，被规定用来刺激美国私人资本向落后地区发展。而美国私人资本对落后地区最感兴趣的是：在这些地区可以获得超额投资利润，并通过投资夺取和控制为美国所急需的原料市场和商品市场。华尔街垄断集团从来也没有打算用它们的过剩资本来真正帮助发展落后国家的工业。它们认为落后国家工业化是和它们的垄断利益直接冲突的。因此它们对落后国家的工业化计划不仅不感兴趣，而且有计划地加以阻碍。经常制定美国垄断资本对外扩张政策的有名的“国际商会”，早在一九四七年发表的一个文件中就说明了美国资本的这个立场，它说，有关对外投资的经济活动，是由外国投资者而不是接受国来决定的。这个文件说，如果落后国家的政府认为“建设一个钢厂比建设许多制造消费品的工厂更为重要”，美国资本就“可能发现该地的气候对外国投资很不利”。美国前国务卿艾奇逊一九五○年在美国参议院发表的声明说得更为明确。他说：“以为我们要为开发不足区域的人民建设大的工厂与矿场，这不是事实。”美国国务院派往巴西的一个技术代表团在它一九五○年的一个正式报告里，曾经说出美国垄断资本对落后国家工业化问题的一个基本考虑：由于“第四点计划”（美国曾经大事宣扬的“援助”落后国家的计划）是根据要“缓和国外经济发展速度对美国经济的冲突”这一目的而制定的，所以美国必须准备“指导落后国家不可避免的工业化”，这种工业化“如果不以第四点计划一类的方式加以控制，即意味着将大大减缩美国出口市场的范围”。
    但是，加强对落后国家的经济掠夺，并不是美国垄断资本提供经济“援助”的唯一的目的。这种“援助”还日益明显地成为美国用来实现其军事侵略和战争准备的重要工具。美国对亚洲经济“援助”差不多一开始就带着显著的服务于军事侵略目的的性质。美国侵略集团发动朝鲜战争后加紧在亚洲制造紧张局势，准备新的战争。美国的援外计划就直接为这一目的服务。杜鲁门的“共同安全法”咨文把美国对外军事、经济援助叫做美国“自己的武装部队的一个组成部分”。“共同安全法”规定接受美国“援助”的国家必须承担协定所规定的军事义务。按照美国的计划，接受“援助”的国家必须建立和扩充作为美国武装部队一部分的亚洲当地军队，并在美国国防部统一计划下进行其他准备侵略战争的罪恶活动。美国国务院的做法是先让亚洲国家接受经济援助，以后再设法使它接受军事援助。美国一九五一年和巴基斯坦签订“技术援助协定”，以后又签订了两个经济援助协定，而在一九五四年签订了美巴军事援助协定。泰国在一九五○年九月接受美国经济援助，同年十月就接受军事援助。大家知道，华盛顿曾不止一次地企图迫使印度尼西亚、缅甸、印度在接受经济援助后继续接受军事援助。美国打算通过这种“援助”把亚洲国家拖入美国的侵略性军事集团，实现它的以“亚洲人打亚洲人”的侵略计划。一九五二年，美国政府干脆把
  “第四点计划”并入“共同安全计划”，这就说明了美国经济技术“援助”的军事意图。美国“新共和”周刊在当时写道：“共同安全计划”的通过，使“第四点计划”穿上了军装。杜鲁门在他的“共同安全法案”咨文中就说，他所请求的经济援助，“主要是用以支持国外已经扩大了的防御努力”。
    朝鲜停战后，美国侵略集团提出要在亚洲发展
  “区域性经济”。这是和美国那时已开始积极在亚洲组织军事集团，拼凑“太平洋公约”的活动相适应的。对亚洲经济援助是要从双边安排到“区域性经济”，为最后建立军事集团奠定基础。美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生去年二、三月间到远东活动后透露，美国在那时已经计划成立一个类似“欧洲经济合作局”的亚洲“区域性专家组织”。按照华盛顿战争集团的计划，这个亚洲“区域性经济”组织是要使日本和亚洲其他一些国家的经济“整体化”，然后在亚洲订立一个类似“北大西洋公约组织”的协定，这样美国就可以在和平民主阵营的东西两侧——欧洲和亚洲都有一个侵略性军事集团，形成突击的形势，而复活起来的德国和日本的军国主义势力将成为这两个集团中的核心力量。
      日内瓦会议后，美国战争集团匆忙在亚洲拼凑
  “东南亚防务集团”，它的经济援助的军事侵略性质也就更加明显了。当时日本共同社从华盛顿发出的一个消息说：美国政府打算加强对“日本等反共国家”的军事和经济援助，以“维持和共产党中国对抗的新远东军事计划”，实施“美国现任政府的所谓亚洲人打亚洲人的战略计划”。
      美国侵略集团这个军事冒险计划在经济援助方面的第一个具体步骤，就是把拟议中的类似“欧洲经济合作局”的亚洲经济组织，直接置于“东南亚防务集团”的下面。美国侵略集团以为这样就可以通过经济援助，把目前仍在拒绝参加美国军事集团的某些亚洲国家诱骗到里面去。用“纽约时报”的说法，华盛顿的想法是，“通过这类组织，中立主义者可能会被带进东南亚防务中某种形式的合作关系中去。日本最后也可能会被包括进去，尽管别的亚洲人害怕这一点。”
    艾森豪威尔最近提出的一九五六年度援外计划中，有一笔两亿美元拨款的“用于亚洲经济发展的总统特别经费”，就是指定作为“区域性经济”之用的。美国目前正在活动通过这种“区域性经济”组织，来实现“纽约时报”所透露的要把亚洲采取独立自主政策的一些国家拖进军事侵略集团的险恶目的。
    亚洲国家需要发展经济，但它们所需要的是在和平的环境中，在国际真诚合作的条件下，求得本身经济的正常发展，摆脱殖民主义的掠夺和剥削。美国侵略集团的掠夺性和侵略性的对外“援助”政策，显然是和亚洲各国人民的这一愿望不相容的。
