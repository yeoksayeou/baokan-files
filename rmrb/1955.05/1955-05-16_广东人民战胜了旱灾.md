　　Guangdong People Conquer Drought
　　By our reporter Ai Ling
    Since the beginning of the spring plowing season this year, the people of Guangdong have launched a struggle against drought. Now they have achieved initial victory and are continuing the fight on the basis of that victory.
    This year's drought in Guangdong is very serious. Many ponds have dried up, streams and rivers have stopped flowing, and even the water-rich areas that are usually not afraid of drought are threatened. In addition, the saltwater tides along the coast have flooded the fields and killed the seedlings. The Party committees at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party have promptly issued emergency instructions for drought resistance in the face of this serious situation, taken effective measures, and successively sent more than 10,000 cadres and technicians to the countryside with a large number of water pumps to help fight the drought. By the beginning of May, more than two-thirds of the 33 million mu of early rice fields in the province had been planted with seedlings.
    During the intense anti-drought struggle, there was a sound of labor everywhere, and millions of peasants gathered and dispersed in an organized manner on the plains, in the valleys, and along the rivers. Countless wells were dug in the fields, and countless derricks were erected. The peasants were constantly lifting buckets of water day and night, letting the well water flow into the fields. Drought resistance in the mountainous areas was even more difficult, with a severe shortage of water sources. Some had to carry water one load at a time, while others used dozens of waterwheels to transport water to the mountains. People understand that every rescue of a handful or a single plant is of great significance to the construction of the motherland. Therefore, large-scale joint county and township drought resistance movements have been launched in many areas, creating anti-drought miracles such as "blocking the Han River," "blocking the North River," "demanding water from the West River," and "opening mountains to divert water." This is an arduous project, especially under difficult material conditions. People have to "intercept" and "block" the滔滔 river water, making it flow against people's will and back to millions of acres of dry land. How amazing and arduous is this! Take the blocking of the Han River to divert water for irrigation. This project mobilized the people of Jieyang, Chenghai, Chao'an, and Raoping counties in the East Guangdong area. In just over ten days, they blocked seventeen river mouths leading to the sea and built a dam 800 meters long and another 400 meters long. In this way, the Han River and the sea were separated, blocking the river water. Then, a 400-meter-long flume as wide as the river surface was erected on the Rongjiang River, allowing the Han River water to cross the Rongjiang River through the flume. After the completion of this huge project, more than 788,000 mu of drought-stricken land in the East Guangdong area was irrigated.
    The Sixth District of Luoding County, located in a high mountain area, simply split the mountain and built a 35-mile-long and a 25-mile-long ring-mountain canal, allowing water to pass through the mountains and irrigate more than 3,000 mu of rice fields, and also turning part of the dry land into fertile land. Gaoyao County also united eleven townships, gathered more than 3,000 people, and arranged 500 waterwheels to transport the water from the West River to the Songlong River, which is 70 miles long. This river can usually accommodate boats, but now it is so dry that even the riverbed mud is cracked. When the dry river was filled with more than three feet of water, the 15,000 mu of seedlings on both banks quickly turned green, and the area for transplanting seedlings expanded.
    In the struggle against drought, Communist Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and many cadres have shown courage and heroism. They have always stood at the forefront of the anti-drought struggle, and their footprints are found wherever it is most dangerous and difficult. For example, Chen Yingjie, the deputy district chief of a district in Jieyang County, jumped into the water with grass in his arms to block the hole during a windy and dangerous moment. When Xinzhai Township in Jieyang County was blocking a breach, the jumping bridge above cracked. The workers carried sandbags and rushed down. Some people said they were taking too much risk, but the workers pointed to the bridge and said: "Look, who is below? Isn't it more dangerous?" It turned out that the district party secretary, deputy secretary, and district committee cadres were below. Communist Youth League members also played a key role, organizing "shock teams" and "brave teams" everywhere, launching red flag competitions everywhere, and inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses.
    Drought resistance is a major task for the people of the whole province. Workers in various cities and towns, the People's Liberation Army, and office cadres are actively supporting it. Workers in Hubei Province also traveled a long way to participate in the construction site project and brought a large number of water pumps. These supports were warmly welcomed by the peasants and also boosted the enthusiasm of the peasants in the fight against drought.
    Around May 9th, many places have experienced continuous rainfall. Farmers are now actively storing water and transplanting seedlings, while preparing to continue fighting against natural disasters and strive to complete this year's agricultural production plan.

### 广东人民战胜了旱灾

　　广东人民战胜了旱灾
　  本报记者  艾玲
    从今年春耕开始，广东人民就向干旱展开了斗争，现在他们已获得初步胜利，并在胜利基础上继续斗争。
    广东今年的旱灾是非常严重的，许多塘水干涸、溪河断流，连历来不怕干旱的水网地带也遭到威胁。而沿海的咸潮又涌到田里把秧苗咸死。中共各级党委面临这一严重情况都及时地发出了抗旱紧急指示，采取了有效措施，并先后派出一万多名干部、技术人员携带大批抽水机下乡帮助抗旱，到五月初旬止，全省三千三百万亩早造田已有三分之二以上插上秧苗。
    抗旱斗争紧张进行的时候，到处是一片劳动声音，千百万个农民有组织地每天集散在平原上，山谷里，江河边。田野里打出无数的水井，竖起无数的吊杆，农民们日夜不停地上下吊着水桶，让井水流到田里；山区的抗旱更是艰苦，水源非常缺，有的只好一担担的挑、有的用几十乘水车把水车到山上去。人们懂得，每抢救一撮一棵庄稼，对建设祖国都是有重大意义的。因而不少地区掀起了大规模的联县联乡的抗旱运动。创造了“封锁韩江”、“堵塞北江”、“向西江要水”以及“开山引水”等等的抗旱奇迹。这是一件艰巨的工程，特别是在物质条件困难的情况下，人们要把滔滔的江水“截拦”、“堵塞”，要它顺着人们的意志，倒流到千百万亩干旱的田里去，这是多么惊人而艰巨的事情啊！就拿封锁韩江，引韩水灌溉来说，这个工程动员了粤东区揭阳、澄海、潮安、饶平四个县人民，在短短十余天内，堵塞了出海的十七个江口，修筑一条八百公尺和一条四百公尺的拦河坝。这样韩江和海便隔了开来，拦住了江水。接着又在榕江的河面上扎起一道和河面一样宽的四百公尺的渡槽，让韩江水经渡槽跨过榕江。这个巨大工程筑成后，粤东区七十八万八千多亩受旱土地便有水灌溉了。
    位在高山地带的罗定县第六区，就是硬把山劈开来，修了一条三十五里长和一条二十五里长的环山水圳，使水穿过山岭、灌溉着三千多亩稻田，还把部分旱地变成良田。高要县也是联合了十一个乡，集合了三千多人，排列着五百部水车，把西江的水车到一条长达七十华里的宋隆河去，这条河，平时能容船只来往，但现在干得连河底泥都裂开了。当干河灌满了三尺多深水的时候，两岸一万五千多亩的秧苗很快返青了，插秧的面积扩大了。
    在抗旱斗争中，共产党员、青年团员以及很多干部，都表现得果敢英勇，他们处处站在抗旱斗争的最前面，那里最危险最艰苦，那里就有他们的踪迹。如揭阳县某区副区长陈应杰，在大风浪紧急关头，抱着草跳下水去堵塞洞口。揭阳县新寨乡堵塞缺口时，上面的跳桥折裂了，民工背着沙袋冲下去，有人说他们太冒险，民工们却指着桥下说：“你看，下面是谁？不是更加危险吗？”原来下面是区委书记，副书记和区委会干部们。青年团员同样发挥了骨干作用，到处组织了“突击队”、“勇敢队”，到处展开了红旗竞赛，鼓舞群众战斗热忱。
    抗旱是全省人民的重大任务，各地城镇工人，人民解放军，机关干部……都在积极支援。湖北省的工人们也远道前往参加工地工程，并携带去大批抽水机。这些支援都受到农民热烈欢迎，也鼓舞了农民们的抗旱斗争热情。
    五月九日前后，许多地方已连续降雨，农民们现正一面积极蓄水、插秧，一面准备继续和自然灾害搏斗，争取完成今年的农业生产计划。
