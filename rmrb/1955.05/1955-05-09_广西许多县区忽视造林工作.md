　　Guangxi's Many Counties and Districts Neglect Afforestation Work
To the Editor:
    The afforestation season this spring has passed, but Guangxi Province's afforestation and seedling cultivation work is far from completing its tasks. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of March, the province had afforested a total of 1.39 million mu, only accounting for 53.4 percent of the original plan; seedling cultivation was over 6,400 mu, only accounting for 38.1 percent of the original plan.
    The reason why Guangxi Province's afforestation and seedling cultivation plan for this spring could not be completed on time, in addition to the objective difficulties of spring drought in many areas of the province (especially in the southwest Guangxi region), is mainly because the leading cadres of many counties and districts lack a comprehensive understanding of implementing the provincial party committee's policy of "focusing on grain production, developing diversified operations according to local conditions," leaving afforestation and seedling cultivation work at the level of general instructions and verbal appeals. In name, it is "integration," to "develop diversified operations" according to local conditions, but in reality, no one is in charge. For example, during the afforestation season, Rong County transferred all forestry cadres to engage in agricultural cooperatives and other work, and no one was responsible for the afforestation movement at all. Tianyang County had not made any arrangements for afforestation and seedling cultivation work until March. A deputy district head in the eighth district of Beiliu County said: "Accumulating fertilizer and repairing water conservancy are central tasks, and repairing roads and transporting grain are national plans, all of which must be completed; afforestation and seedling cultivation are integrated, and there is no problem if they are not completed." Even in Fangcheng County, which is a key forestry county and rich in special economic forests such as anise and cassia, and where in many districts forestry income is the main source of livelihood for farmers, the leading cadres of the county and districts still do not manage forestry production, believing that this is a matter for forestry cadres, and as a result, the afforestation movement is developing very unevenly. Secondly, the "whoever plants, owns" policy in forestry production has not been well implemented. Many areas have not properly arranged for the recording of work points, scoring, and future distribution of income for afforestation by cooperatives or rural collectives, and the handling of timber entering the cooperatives in some areas is not appropriate, which has caused great concerns among farmers and affected their enthusiasm for afforestation. Furthermore, the technical guidance work for afforestation is also very poor. For example, the Pingle Special District plans to afforest 160,000 mu of Chinese fir forests this year, about half of which need to be solved with seedling problems through Chinese fir cutting afforestation; however, the local masses did not have this habit in the past, and the technical guidance work of the leading organs could not keep up, so the Chinese fir cutting afforestation work is developing very slowly.
    In addition, most agricultural production cooperatives regard afforestation work as an incidental task or even an extra burden and have not included it in their production plans. Therefore, forestry production does not have a reliable base in most areas. There was even such a thing: an agricultural cooperative in Yangshuo County had a project to afforest 180 mu in its production plan, and the members automatically looked for wild forest seedlings to plant. When the Minister of the County Party Committee's Organization Department learned about it, he was very dissatisfied. In addition to investigating responsibility, he also stopped the members from finding wild seedlings for afforestation.
    According to Guangxi's natural conditions, if the policy of multi-season afforestation is implemented, this year's afforestation task can still be completed. This requires leading cadres in various counties and districts of Guangxi Province to correct their thinking that neglects forestry production, include afforestation work in the rural production plan, and conduct practical leadership and specific arrangements; if they continue to disregard it as in the past, or just make verbal appeals, this year's national afforestation plan will fall through.

### 广西许多县区忽视造林工作

　　广西许多县区忽视造林工作编辑同志：
    今春的造林季节已经过了，而广西省造林育苗工作还远远没有完成任务。据不完全统计，到三月底为止，全省共造林一百三十九万亩，只占原计划的百分之五十三点四；育苗六千四百多亩，只占原计划的百分之三十八点一。
    广西省今春造林育苗计划之所以不能按时完成，除了省内不少地区（特别是桂西南地区）发生春旱的客观困难以外，主要原因是不少县区的领导干部对于贯彻省委“以粮食生产为主，因地制宜，发展多种经营”的方针，缺乏全面的了解，把造林育苗工作停留在一般指示和口头号召上，名义上是“结合”，要因地制宜“发展多种经营”，实际上没人管。例如，容县在造林季节中把全部林业干部抽调去搞农业社和其它工作，造林运动根本无人负责。田阳县直到三月份对造林育苗工作还没有作过布置。北流县八区一个副区长说：“积肥、修水利是中心工作，修公路、运粮是国家计划，都必须完成；造林育苗是结合的，完不成没有问题。”甚至像防城县是林业重点县，盛产八角、玉桂等特用经济林，在很多区林业收入是农民的主要生活来源，但县区领导干部仍不管林业生产，认为这是林业干部的事，因而造林运动开展得很不平衡。其次，林业生产中的“谁种谁有”政策没有很好贯彻。不少地区对合作社或乡村集体造林的记工、评分和将来收益的分配问题没有妥善安排，部分地区对林木入社的处理不够恰当，农民顾虑很大，影响了造林热情。再次，造林的技术指导工作做得也很差。像平乐专区今年计划造杉林十六万亩，约有一半需要由杉树插条造林来解决苗木问题；但是当地群众过去没有这种习惯，领导机关技术指导工作又跟不上去，杉树插条造林工作就开展得很慢。
    此外，大部分农业生产合作社把造林工作当成附带任务甚至额外负担，没有列入生产计划之内，因此林业生产在大部地区就没有可靠的阵地。甚至还出现了这样的事：阳朔县一个农业社在生产计划中订有造林一百八十亩的项目，社员们自动地寻找野生林苗来栽种，县委组织部长知道了就大为不满，除了要追究责任外，还制止社员找野生苗造林。
    根据广西的自然条件，如果贯彻多季造林的方针，今年的造林任务还是可以完成的。这就要求广西省各地县区领导干部端正忽视林业生产的思想，把造林工作列入农村生产计划之内，进行切实的领导和具体的安排；假若再像过去一样不加重视，或者只是口头号召，今年国家的造林计划就会落空了。　　　　　胡执东
