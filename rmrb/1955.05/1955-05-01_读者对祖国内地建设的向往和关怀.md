Recently, we have received many letters from readers expressing their desire to participate in construction work in the interior of the motherland. These letters reflect the readers' love for the interior and their concern for its construction.

    Wang Shouxiang from Qingdao Normal School wrote: With the development of our country's economic construction and the daily increase in production, it is particularly important to develop the vast and rich interior in a timely manner. During the reactionary rule, China's economy was dominated by imperialism, causing abnormal prosperity in a few coastal cities; while the vast and fertile interior suffered from backward production, inconvenient transportation, and undeveloped natural resources. Since liberation, people have been very eager to go to the great northwest of the motherland and build this region for a long time. As far as I know, many young people in Qingdao City have grand aspirations to build the great northwest, and some are preparing their own travel expenses and preparing to set off. I think the enthusiasm of these young people is valuable, but unplanned actions are also not good. We should look forward to the call of the motherland and go to the places where the motherland needs us most.

    Reader Liu Shifan wrote: The northwest of the motherland is a rich place, with abundant mineral deposits and future fertile land. There, the population is small, with an average of only two or three people per square kilometer; while the southeastern provinces of the motherland have five or six hundred people per square kilometer. I volunteer to participate in the reclamation work in the northwest region, transform the nature of the northwest of the motherland, and build it into a beautiful place.

    Zhou Baolong, a reader from Neixiang, Henan, wrote: I volunteer to work in the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai. There, there is a lot of land and few people, and abundant mineral deposits. After I get there, I will definitely work with the comrades there to create happiness in difficult environments and increase socialist strength. I have undergone various combat tests, especially the test of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, so I believe that I can forge ahead courageously in difficult environments and will never be afraid of hardship and retreat. I believe that labor creation in difficult environments is the most meaningful, valuable, glorious, and happiest life. Of course, personal wishes must be subordinate to the needs of the Party and the people. First of all, I still obey going to the place where the motherland needs me most.

    Guo Jiying, a staff member of the Zibo branch of the China Pharmaceutical Company, wrote: I really envy the people working in the interior. If I have the opportunity to be sent to the interior of the motherland, I will be very happy. I think, helping minority brothers and sisters to carry out economic and cultural construction and strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups is such a glorious thing!

    Many readers, when expressing their desire to go to the interior, have a common understanding of the greatest honor in life, that is: to go to the place where the motherland needs you most and build a beautiful and prosperous country with your own hands. They said: the more difficult the place, the more underdeveloped the production and culture, the more it will temper our will. They believe that under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through their labor and creation, backward places will surely become advanced places in the future.

### 读者对祖国内地建设的向往和关怀

    读者对祖国内地建设的向往和关怀
    最近，我们接到不少读者来信表示志愿到祖国的内地参加建设工作。这些来信反映了读者对内地的热爱和对内地建设的关怀。
    青岛师范王守祥来信说：随着我国经济建设的发展和生产的一天天提高，及时开发广阔富饶的内地也就显得特别重要。在反动统治时代，我国的经济受着帝国主义的支配，使得沿海几个大城市畸形繁荣；而广阔肥饶的内地则生产落后，交通不便，天然资源得不到开发。解放以来，人们非常想望到祖国的大西北去，长期地建设这个地区。据我知道，青岛市有很多青年都抱着建设大西北的宏大志愿，有的人自己筹备旅费，准备出发，我认为这些青年的热情是可贵的，但是，无计划的行动也是不好的。我们应该期待着祖国的号召，到祖国最需要的地方去。
    读者刘世帆同志来信说：祖国的西北是一个富饶的地方，那里，有丰富的矿藏，有未来的良田，那里，人口少，平均每平方公里只有两三人；而祖国东南各省每平方公里有五、六百人。我志愿参加西北地区的开垦工作，改造祖国西北的大自然，把那里建设成为一个美丽的地方。
    河南内乡读者周保龙来信说：我志愿到青海柴达木盆地去工作。那里，地多人少，矿藏丰富。我到那里后，一定和那里的同志一起，在艰苦环境中创造幸福，增加社会主义力量。我经过各种战斗的考验，特别是抗美援朝的考验，所以我相信自己能在艰苦环境中勇往直前，绝不会怕苦退却。我认为在艰苦环境中进行劳动创造是最有意义、最有价值的，也是最光荣、最幸福的生活。当然，个人愿望必须服从党和人民的需要，首先我还是服从到祖国最需要的地方去。
    中国医药公司淄博支公司职员郭纪英来信说：我实在羡慕在内地工作的人们。如果有机会派我到祖国的内地去，我很高兴。我想，帮助少数兄弟民族进行经济、文化建设，加强各民族的团结，这是一件多么光荣的事啊！
    许多读者在表示志愿到内地去的时候，对于人生最大的荣誉有着一个共同的认识，这就是：到祖国最需要的地方去，用自己的双手建设美丽富强的国家。他们表示：愈是艰苦的地方，愈是生产和文化不发达的地方，就会愈加锻炼我们的意志，他们相信：在中国共产党的正确领导下，经过他们的劳动创造，落后的地方将来一定要变成先进的地方。
