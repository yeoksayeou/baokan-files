Hu Feng's Smoke Screen
　　Zheng Linfan
　　I finished reading Hu Feng's self-criticism with great indignation. In his self-criticism, Hu Feng is trying to pull another trick, which is a smoke screen. If the Party newspaper hadn't published Hu Feng's self-criticism along with Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique," and if I hadn't read Shu Wu's exposé first, I would have been deceived by Hu Feng. I would have thought that Hu Feng had begun to "feel" the many comrades' well-intentioned help during this period, and had begun to recognize his mistakes and wanted to correct them, although there were still many self-justifying elements in the criticism. But now it proves that this is not the case. Hu Feng is trying to use self-criticism to block others' criticism of him, and trying to replace genuine ideological reform with a fake review. His words in the "self-criticism" such as "hope to get the continued help of comrades" and "reform himself under the leadership of the Party" are all nonsense. In fact, he is still deceiving the Party and the people.
　　Our classmates at the Renmin University of China welcome the Party newspaper's disclosure of the materials of the Hu Feng anti-Party and anti-people clique, and we welcome even more the solemn attitude taken by the Party newspaper towards Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique. This is not only helpful to Hu Feng and his clique, but also of great educational significance to the broad masses of the people and intellectuals—especially intellectuals who have come from the old society. From the Hu Feng issue, we can learn a lesson. On the one hand, we must be vigilant and strictly prevent the erosion of our ideology by the decadent bourgeois ideology; on the other hand, we must improve our vigilance and not allow bourgeois ideology to find a hiding place in the new China. We hope that Hu Feng and every member of the Hu Feng faction will truly recognize their mistakes, resolutely reform themselves under the leadership of the Party, and become a true person.

　  胡风的遮眼术
    郑林范
    我以十分愤慨的心情读完胡风的自我批判。胡风在自我批判中，又要出另一套花招，那是遮眼术。如果不是党报把胡风的自我批判和舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”一同发表，如果我不是先看了舒芜的揭发材料，我就会被胡风所蒙骗；我会觉得胡风已开始从这些时许多同志给他的善意帮助得到“感受”，已开始认识自己的错误而要求改正错误，虽然在批判里面还带有不少自我辩解的成分。但是现在证明，事实并非如此。胡风企图以自我批判来挡住别人对他的批判，企图以假的检讨来代替真正的思想改造。他在“自我批判”中说的“希望得到同志们底继续帮助”、“在党底领导下面改造自己”等等，都是一派胡言。事实上，他仍是在欺骗党，欺骗人民。
    我们中国人民大学的同学们欢迎党报披露胡风的反党反人民集团的材料，我们更欢迎党报对胡风及其反党小集团所采取的严正态度，这不但对胡风及其小集团有帮助，就是对广大人民、广大知识分子——特别是从旧社会生活过来的知识分子也有极大的教育意义。从胡风的问题上，我们可以得到借鉴，一方面要提高警惕，严防资产阶级腐朽思想对我们的侵蚀；一方面要提高自己的警觉性，不容资产阶级思想在新中国找到藏身场所。我们希望胡风及胡风派每一个人真正认识错误，在党的领导下坚决改造自己，做个真正的人。
