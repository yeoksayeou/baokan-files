Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 30th: China's newly appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the German Democratic Republic, Zeng Yongquan, accompanied by Counselor Wang Yutian, Xu Ming, Commercial Counselor Zhang Guangdou, and all embassy staff, presented his credentials to President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic on the 29th. Present at the ceremony were Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hanke, Director of the Presidential Office, Opitz, Director of the President's Private Office, Wünsche, Director of the First Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gross, Director of the Protocol Department, Thun, and others.

Ambassador Zeng Yongquan delivered a eulogy to President Pieck upon presenting his credentials, and President Pieck delivered a reply.

In his eulogy, Ambassador Zeng Yongquan stated that under the correct leadership of the Socialist Unity Party and the government of the German Democratic Republic, and with the sincere and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and close cooperation with fraternal countries, the people of the German Democratic Republic have not only achieved tremendous successes in political, economic, and cultural fields but have also made outstanding contributions to the struggle against the arming of West Germany and in safeguarding European peace and easing international tensions. The government and people of the People's Republic of China feel infinitely delighted and admire the various achievements made by the government and people of the German Democratic Republic. The American aggressor bloc and its followers are attempting to revive German militarism and deepen the division of Germany and Europe by implementing the "Paris Agreement." The just struggle of the German people for the peaceful reunification of their country and for the establishment of European collective security will continue to receive the full support of the Chinese government and people.

Ambassador Zeng Yongquan concluded by expressing his full commitment to promoting the development and consolidation of the friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese and German peoples.

In his reply, President Pieck stated that the government and people of the German Democratic Republic are observing with sincere joy and admiration the glorious achievements made by the great Chinese people and their government in the struggle to build socialism and safeguard world peace. President Pieck pointed out that in the recently held Asian-African Conference, the People's Republic of China once again won the trust and sympathy of the people of all countries.

President Pieck continued: The German people have consistently received the full support of the Chinese people in their struggle for the peaceful restoration of national unity. We are pleased to know that, in addition to the great socialist Soviet Union, there is another loyal and powerful friend like the People's Republic of China standing with us. President Pieck pointed out that the passage of the Paris war agreement in a series of countries is a serious threat to peace. Under these circumstances, deepening the friendly relations between our two peoples is of even greater significance.

President Pieck said that the order of Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China to end the state of war against Germany is a new and clear manifestation of the great trust of the Chinese people in the peace-loving forces of the German people.

President Pieck concluded by saying, "Please allow me to express my assurance: Mr. Ambassador, in fulfilling your responsible task, I and the government of the German Democratic Republic will do everything possible to provide the greatest support."

    曾涌泉大使在颂词中说，德意志民主共和国人民在统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府的正确领导下、在伟大苏联真诚无私的援助和同兄弟国家的亲密合作下，不但在政治经济文化各方面获得了巨大的成就，而且在反对武装西德以及在维护欧洲和平、和缓国际紧张局势的斗争中作出了卓越的贡献。中华人民共和国政府和人民为德意志民主共和国政府和人民所取得的各项成就感到无限的欢欣和敬佩。美国侵略集团和它的追随者正在企图通过实现“巴黎协定”复活德国军国主义加深德国和欧洲的分裂。德国人民为争取实现祖国的和平统一、为建立欧洲集体安全所进行的正义斗争将继续得到中国政府和人民的全力支持。
    曾涌泉大使最后表示将全力促进中德两国人民之间的友好合作关系的发展和巩固。
    皮克总统在答词中说，德意志民主共和国政府和人民以真挚的高兴和钦佩，注视着伟大的中国人民和他们的政府在建设社会主义和保障世界和平的斗争中所取得的光荣的成就。皮克总统指出，在最近举行的亚非会议中，中华人民共和国又一次赢得了各国人民的信任和同情。
    皮克总统接着说：德国人民在他们为和平恢复祖国统一的斗争中经常受到中国人民的充分支持。我们愉快地知道：除了伟大的社会主义苏联以外，还有一个像中华人民共和国那样忠实和强大的朋友和我们在一起。皮克总统指出：巴黎战争协定在一连串国家中被通过是对和平的一个严重威胁。在这种情势下加深我们两国人民间的友好关系就具有更大的意义。
    皮克总统说，中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志关于结束对德战争状态的命令，是中国人民对德国人民的爱好和平力量的伟大信任的一个新的明显的表现。
    皮克总统最后说，请让我表示我的保证：大使同志，在你履行你的负责的任务时，我以及德意志民主共和国政府将尽一切力量给予最大的支持。
