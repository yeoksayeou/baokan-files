　　In recent years, fruit production in our country has been developing year by year. However, until now, the Party and government leading organs in many fruit-producing areas have not paid enough attention to fruit tree production. They lack overall consideration and long-term plans, and have not made appropriate arrangements for fruit tree production in leading agricultural production, so that fruit tree production has fallen into varying degrees of laissez-faire.

　　In the initial years of restoring agricultural production, Party and government leading organs in various places concentrated their main efforts on leading farmers to increase grain and cotton production, and could not spare much energy to strengthen leadership over fruit tree production. This was unavoidable. However, the reason why many people relaxed their leadership over fruit tree production is that they did not realize the value of fruit tree production. Fruit is a very valuable economic crop and a very important export commodity. According to rough calculations, exporting one ton of soybeans can be exchanged for one ton of steel, while exporting one ton of tangerines can be exchanged for two tons of steel. From 1951 to 1954, the fruit exported from our country could be exchanged for about 10,000 tractors, or a complete set of machinery and equipment for six seamless steel pipe plants. At present, our country's fruit exports are still restricted by fruit yield and quality. If we can increase fruit yield and improve fruit quality, we can greatly increase the export volume of fruit and exchange it for more industrial equipment for the country.

　　With the improvement of the living standards of urban and rural people, the domestic market's demand for fruit has also increased significantly. In 1954, the number of apples supplied to Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai by state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives alone increased more than four times compared with 1951. The sales volume of fruits in other cities has also increased significantly. Fruit is an important raw material for the food industry and brewing industry. A large increase in fruit production can not only promote the development of the food industry, but also be used as raw materials for brewing, saving a lot of grain for the country.

　　The vast number of farmers in our country, especially mountain farmers, pay great attention to developing fruit tree production. In some major fruit-producing areas, income from fruit tree management accounts for more than 40% to 60% of farmers' total annual income. In order to promote the development of mountain production and improve the lives of mountain people, we should also strengthen leadership over fruit tree production.

　　Our country has superior natural conditions. From Northeast China to Hainan, from coastal areas to Xinjiang, there are a large number of mountains and wastelands suitable for planting fruit trees that have not yet been utilized. It is entirely possible to greatly expand the area planted with fruit trees under the principle of "not competing with grain and cotton for land." All areas where fruit tree production accounts for a considerable proportion, as well as areas where fruit trees are currently scarce but have the conditions for development, must put the task of developing fruit tree production on the agenda. When formulating agricultural production plans, the Party and government leading organs in these areas should conduct overall consideration and planning for fruit tree production, strive to increase the yield and quality of fruits in existing orchards, and at the same time, expand and reclaim new orchards in a planned manner.

　　Pests and diseases are the greatest threat to fruit tree production. The yields of many fruits are often greatly reduced and the quality is lowered due to damage. Striving to prevent and control pests and diseases and improve the cultivation and management of orchards plays a decisive role in increasing fruit yield and quality. We must conscientiously implement the policy of "prevention is more important than cure," adopt comprehensive prevention and control measures, and expand the prevention and control area step by step to improve the prevention and control effect. For pests and diseases for which effective prevention and control methods are already available, prevention and control work should be gradually carried out on a large scale. For pests and diseases that are seriously harmful but for which there are currently no effective prevention and control methods, relevant scientific research departments should be organized to intensify research and experimentation, and find effective prevention and control methods as soon as possible. It is now the season when fruit tree pests and diseases are beginning to occur or are about to occur. The agricultural departments in fruit tree areas, especially the technology promotion stations, should regard the prevention and control of fruit tree pests and diseases as the primary task, and promptly organize forces to strengthen prevention and control guidance and carry out mass prevention and control campaigns.

　　The phenomenon of "resting branches" and reduced production of fruit trees is very serious in various parts of our country. This is an important reason for the low and unstable fruit yield. The output of sweet oranges in Sichuan and Hunan in the fruit-bearing year and the resting-branch year generally differ by more than one time. However, the fruit trees planted by some fruit tree production cooperatives and labor models can produce abundant harvests year after year, and the output exceeds the local average output by one to several times. The citrus planted by Huang Meichen, a labor model in Guangdong Province, has a yield of more than 9,000 catties per mu, far exceeding the local average yield. This situation shows that the production potential of existing orchards is very large, and the phenomenon of fruit tree "resting branches" can be changed. Agricultural departments at all levels should urge fruit tree experimental research institutions and technology promotion institutions to conduct experimental research on the main technical measures such as pruning, fertilization, and intercropping green manure in orchards of the main local fruit trees based on summarizing the experience of mass bumper harvests, and gradually formulate reasonable technical measures suitable for the natural conditions of different regions, in order to guide the masses to promote them.

　　In order to greatly develop fruit production, it is necessary to plan to open up and expand new orchards in mountainous areas and wastelands. In order to encourage "fruit trees to go up the mountains," the state allows farmers to apply for the use of public barren mountains and wastelands to plant fruit trees. Before developing new orchards, the Party and government organs in various places should urge the agricultural departments to conduct surveys of garden land and fruit tree resources, and determine the types, varieties, and area plans for planting fruit trees based on climate, soil, transportation conditions, and the needs of domestic sales, exports, and processing, to avoid the tendency of blind development. Agricultural departments should strengthen technical guidance to farmers, pay attention to soil and water conservation, ensure that seedlings are planted well and survive, and pay attention to protection and nurturing to promote the early growth and fruiting of young trees. In the past, some areas only paid attention to planting fruit trees but did not pay attention to managing fruit trees. The masses criticized: "They only care about fruit trees going up the mountains, but they don't care about the fruit trees on the mountains." This situation must be corrected.

　　The large-scale development of new orchards must rely on production cooperatives to carry out in a planned manner. The Party and government leading organs in fruit-producing areas should strengthen the specific leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations for fruit tree production, and the agricultural departments should give more technical guidance and assistance to mutual aid and cooperation organizations for fruit tree production, cultivate technical backbones for fruit tree production for cooperatives, and help mutual aid and cooperation organizations improve fruit yield and quality.

　　Strengthening the cooperation and support of trade, supply and marketing cooperation, finance, transportation, and processing departments for fruit tree production is an important condition for developing fruit tree production. Fruits are easily damaged and spoiled. If they cannot be properly handled in terms of procurement, storage, transportation, loading and unloading, it will cause huge losses to farmers and the country. In many areas, due to the small quantity and variety of fruits purchased, there have been constant phenomena of unsalable fruits. The farmers in these areas were forced to feed pigs with fruits or compost them, which is a great loss to the country and the farmers. The reason why this situation occurs is related to the poor transportation, marketing and storage equipment conditions in the local area, and also related to the fact that the local state-owned commercial, supply and marketing cooperation and transportation departments neglect the fruit transportation and marketing work. State-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperation departments should use greater efforts (including organizing and using the strength of private merchants) to carry out fruit procurement and marketing work; set up more purchasing points in areas with inconvenient transportation, and expand the types and scope of purchases; at the same time, do a good job in the supply of materials in fruit-producing areas. In terms of purchase and sale prices, reasonable variety price differences and seasonal price differences for fruits should be determined. The fruit prices in some areas are not reasonable enough and should be adjusted. For bulk fruits suitable for storage, farmers are encouraged to carry out appropriate storage to extend the fruit supply period. In order to support the development of fruit tree production, banks and credit cooperatives should provide necessary loans to farmers in economically difficult and newly developed fruit-producing areas to help them overcome the difficulties of purchasing seedlings, medicines, machinery and other means of production. The light industry and local industry departments should, according to needs and possibilities, study and formulate various fruit processing and brewing plans as early as possible, so as to facilitate the planned arrangement of production in fruit-producing areas.

　　Our country's fruit tree production has extremely broad development prospects. Relying on the leadership and specific assistance of Party committees and governments at all levels, and relying on the hard work of the vast number of farmers, more and more orchards will surely appear on our vast land. These orchards will support the country's construction and supply the needs of the people with more and better fruits.

　　增产更多更好的果品
    近几年来，我国的果品生产正在逐年发展，但直到现在，许多果产区的党政领导机关对于果树生产重视不够，缺乏通盘考虑和长远计划，没有在领导农业生产中对果树生产加以适当的安排，以致果树生产陷于不同程度的自流状态。
    在恢复农业生产的最初几年，各地党政领导机关集中主要力量领导农民增产粮食和棉花，对果树生产不能分出很多力量加强领导，这是难以避免的。但是，许多人所以放松了对于果树生产的领导，还因为他们没有认识果树生产的价值。果品是一种很有价值的经济作物，是很重要的出口物资。根据粗略的计算，出口一吨大豆可以换回一吨钢材，而出口一吨柑橘就可以换回两吨钢材。我国从一九五一年到一九五四年出口的果品，大约可以换回一万部拖拉机，或六个无缝钢管厂的全套机器设备。目前我国果品的出口，还受着果品产量和质量方面的限制。如果我们能够增加果品产量，提高果品质量，就能够更大量地增加果品的出口量，给国家换回更多的工业设备。
    随着城乡人民生活的改善，国内市场对果品的需要也显著地增加了。一九五四年仅由国营公司和供销社供应北京、天津、上海三市的苹果数量，就比一九五一年增加了四倍多。其他城市的果品销售量增加得也很显著。果品是食品工业和酿造业的重要原料，大量增产果品，不但可以促进食品工业的发展，而且可以充作酿酒的原料，为国家节约大量的粮食。
    我国广大农民，特别是山区农民，对于发展果树生产是很注意的。在一些主要果品产区，经营果树的收入占农民全年总收入的百分之四十到六十以上。为了促进山区生产的发展，改善山区人民的生活，也应该加强对果树生产的领导。
    我国自然条件优越，从东北到海南，从沿海到新疆，都有大量的适于栽植果树但还没有加以利用的山地和荒地。在“不与粮、棉争地”的原则下，大大扩充果树栽植面积是完全可能的。凡是果树生产占有相当比重的地区，以及目前果树虽然很少但有发展条件的地区，都要把发展果树生产的任务提到议事日程上来。这些地区的党政领导机关在拟定农业生产计划的时候，应该把果树生产加以通盘的考虑和规划，努力提高现有果园的果品产量和质量，同时有计划地扩大和垦辟新果园。
    病虫害是果树生产的最大威胁，许多果品常常因为受害而产量大减，质量降低。努力防治病虫害和改善果园的培植管理，对于提高果品产量和质量具有决定性的作用。必须认真贯彻“防重于治”的方针，采取综合防治的办法，有步骤地扩大防治面积，提高防治效果。对于已有有效防治办法的病虫害，防治工作应逐步在大面积上展开。对于为害严重但现在还没有有效防治办法的病虫害，应组织有关的科学研究部门加紧研究试验，尽可能在短期内找出有效的防治办法。目前正是果树病虫害开始发生或将要发生的季节，果树区的农业部门，特别是技术推广站，应把防治果树病虫害作为首要任务，及时组织力量，加强防治指导，开展群众性的防治运动。
    我国各地的果树“歇枝”减产的现象非常严重。这是果品产量低和不稳定的重要原因。四川和湖南的甜橙的产果年和歇枝年的产量，一般都相差一倍以上。但某些果树生产合作社和劳动模范种植的果树，却能年年丰产，产量超过当地平均产量一倍到几倍。广东省的劳动模范黄美琛所种的柑橘，每亩产量达九千多斤，远远超过当地平均产量。这种情形说明，现有果园的生产潜力是很大的，果树“歇枝”的现象是可以改变的。各级农业部门应该督促果树试验研究机构和技术推广机构，在总结群众丰产经验的基础上，对当地主要果树的整枝修剪、施肥、果园间作绿肥等主要技术措施进行试验研究，逐步制定适合不同地区的自然条件的合理的技术措施，以便指导群众推行。
    为了大量发展水果生产，必须有计划地在山区、荒地开辟和扩大新果园。为了鼓励“果树上山”，国家允许农民申请使用公有荒山、荒地栽植果树。在发展新果园之前，各地党政机关应督促农业部门进行园地的勘测和果树资源的调查工作，根据气候、土壤、交通条件以及内销、外销和加工的需要，确定栽植果树的种类、品种和面积的计划，避免盲目发展的偏向。农业部门要对农民加强技术指导，注意水土保持，保证把果苗栽好栽活，并且注意保护抚育，促进幼树早日成长结果。过去有些地区只注意栽植果树，不注意管理果树，群众批评说：“只管果树上山，不管山上的果树”。这种情况必须加以纠正。
    大量开辟新果园，必须依靠生产合作社有计划地进行。果产区的党、政领导机关应加强对果树生产互助合作组织的具体领导，农业部门应给予果树生产互助合作组织以更多的技术指导和援助，给合作社培养果树生产技术骨干，帮助互助合作组织提高果品产量和质量。
    加强贸易、供销合作、金融、运输、加工等部门对果树生产的配合和支持，是发展果树生产的重要条件。果品容易损坏和腐烂。如果在收购、储藏、运输、装卸等方面不能妥善地加以处理，就会给农民和国家造成巨大损失。在不少地区，由于收购果品的数量小、种类少，曾不断发生果品滞销现象。这些地区的农民被迫用水果喂猪或沤粪，这对国家和对农民都是很大的损失。这种情况之所以产生，同当地的运销和储藏设备条件不好有关系，也同当地的国营商业、供销合作和运输部门忽视果品运销工作分不开。国营商业和供销合作部门应以更大的力量（包括组织和利用私商的力量）开展果品收购、运销工作；在交通不便的地区增设收购点，扩大收购的种类和范围；同时做好果产区的物资供应工作。在购销价格上，应该合理地确定果品的品种差价和季节差价。现在有些地区的果品价格不够合理，应该加以调整。对于大宗的适于贮藏的果品，鼓励农民进行适当贮藏，以延长果品供应期。为了支持果树生产的发展，银行和信用合作社应对经济条件困难的和新发展的果产区的农民给予必要的贷款，帮助他们克服购置种苗、药械等生产资料的困难。轻工业和地方工业部门应根据需要和可能，及早地研究制定各种果品的加工、酿造计划，以便于果产区有计划地安排生产。
    我国的果树生产有着极其广阔的发展前途。依靠各级党委和政府的领导和具体帮助，依靠广大农民的辛勤劳动，一定会有越来越多的果园出现在我国广大的土地上。这些果园将以更多更好的果品支援国家的建设和供应人民的需要。
