Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: TASS Vienna, May 15th: Representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France, and a representative of the Republic of Austria, officially signed the Austrian State Treaty at 11:30 AM Central European Time on May 15th in the Marble Hall of the Belvedere Palace in Vienna.

Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: According to TASS Vienna: On the 14th, the foreign ministers of the four countries held a meeting in Vienna to study the signing of the Austrian State Treaty. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, US Secretary of State Dulles, British Foreign Secretary Macmillan, French Foreign Minister Pinay, and Austrian Foreign Minister Figl attended the meeting.

The meeting was chaired by Molotov. He suggested that the meeting first study possible opinions on the full text of the treaty drafted by the Four-Power Ambassadors Conference. Dulles, Pinay, and Macmillan said they recommended adopting the full text of the treaty drafted by the aforementioned Ambassadors Conference. Figl said that the Austrian government requested the deletion of the third paragraph of the preamble to the treaty concerning Austria's participation in past wars. Molotov said that the Soviet delegation had no objection to this proposal from the Austrian delegation if other delegations agreed to this proposal as well. Dulles, Pinay, and Macmillan said they had no objection to this proposal.

Since no one expressed any other opinions on the full text of the treaty, Chairman Molotov read out the first five sections of the memorandum signed in Moscow by the delegations of the Soviet government and the Austrian government, the contents of which had already been notified to the governments of the United States, Great Britain, and France.

These five sections are:

"1. The Austrian Federal Government, in the spirit of the declaration made at the Berlin Conference in 1954 regarding non-participation in military alliances and non-permitting the establishment of military bases on its territory, will issue a declaration committing Austria to international obligations: Austria will permanently maintain neutrality like Switzerland.

2. The Austrian Federal Government will submit this Austrian declaration to the Austrian Parliament in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Constitution, so that a resolution on this declaration can be passed immediately after the Austrian State Treaty is ratified.

3. The Federal Government will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the declaration approved by the Austrian Parliament is internationally recognized.

4. The Austrian Federal Government will welcome the guarantees proposed by the Four Powers regarding the integrity and inviolability of the national territory of Austria.

5. The Austrian Federal Government will recommend that the governments of France, Great Britain, and the United States issue a statement regarding the provision of such guarantees by the Four Powers."

Molotov expressed his belief that the representatives of the United States, France, and Great Britain would agree to the proposals made by the Austrian government in the above five sections of the Soviet-Austrian memorandum.

Dulles said that the US government was already aware of the contents of this memorandum, and the United States did not object to Austria adhering to the policy stated in the memorandum. Pinay and Macmillan said that they had no objections in principle to Austria's intention to issue the declaration mentioned in the memorandum, but they hoped to know the wording of this Austrian declaration.

Molotov pointed out that the foreign ministers of the United States, France, and Great Britain had expressed their agreement with Austria's intention to remain permanently neutral like Switzerland. Molotov said that in this regard, it would be best to also stipulate what the four governments should do regarding Austria's declaration of neutrality. Molotov read out the Soviet draft of a corresponding declaration that the four countries should issue for this purpose. The draft declaration stated: "The governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the French Republic declare that the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France will respect and observe Austria's status of permanent neutrality as Switzerland maintains in its relations with other countries."

Dulles said he thought the Soviet delegation's proposal of a draft four-power declaration was useful. He would temporarily reserve his opinion until he had learned of the Austrian Parliament's views. However, Dulles added that he did not object in principle to the draft declaration proposed by the Soviet delegation.

Pinay and Macmillan also expressed their views in the same spirit.

Next to speak was Figl. He said that the Austrian government would submit the declaration of neutrality made in accordance with the Moscow agreement to the Austrian Parliament for review. He also expressed his willingness to submit a preliminary draft of this declaration to the four delegations participating in the meeting. When asked by Molotov whether the Austrian government delegation had any comments on the draft four-power declaration, Figl said that the Austrian government fully agreed with the draft proposed by the Soviet delegation. The meeting unanimously agreed that the Austrian government delegation would submit to the meeting a preliminary draft of an Austrian government declaration on neutrality. Molotov said that the Soviet delegation would submit to the meeting a written draft of the four-power declaration it had proposed.

The meeting then moved on to study the issue of procedures for signing the Austrian State Treaty. The meeting adopted the proposal of the head of the Austrian delegation, Figl, to hold the signing ceremony for the Austrian State Treaty at 11:30 AM on May 15th at the Belvedere Palace.

　　苏美英法奥代表签署对奥和约
　　苏联提出保证奥地利中立的四国声明草案
　　新华社十五日讯  塔斯社维也纳十五日讯：苏联、美国、英国和法国的代表们和奥地利共和国的一位代表在十五日中欧时间上午十一时三十分在维也纳贝尔维德雷宫大理石厅正式签署了对奥和约。
　　新华社十五日讯  据塔斯社维也纳讯：十四日四国外长在维也纳举行会议，研究签订对奥和约。苏联外交部长莫洛托夫、美国国务卿杜勒斯、英国外交大臣麦克米伦、法国外交部长比内和奥地利外交部长费格尔参加了会议。
    会议由莫洛托夫担任主席。他建议会议首先研究对四国大使会议所草拟的条约全文可能提出的意见。杜勒斯及比内和麦克米伦说，他们建议通过上述大使会议所草拟的这个条约的全文。费格尔说，奥地利政府请求取消条约序文中关于奥地利参加过去的战争问题的第三段。莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团对奥地利代表团的这项建议没有反对意见，如果其他代表团也同意这个建议的话。杜勒斯、比内和麦克米伦说，他们不反对这项建议。
    因为没有人对条约全文表示其他的意见，主席莫洛托夫宣读了苏联政府代表团和奥地利政府代表团在莫斯科签字的、内容已经通知美、英、法三国政府的备忘录中的头五节。
    这五节是：
    “一、奥地利联邦政府将按照一九五四年在柏林会议上所作的关于不参加军事同盟和不容许在自己的领土上建立军事基地这一声明的精神，发表关于使奥地利承担国际义务的宣言：奥地利将永久保持像瑞士那样的中立。
    二、奥地利联邦政府将按照联邦宪法的规定把这一奥地利宣言提交奥地利议会，以便在对奥和约一经批准之后立即就这一宣言通过决议。
    三、联邦政府将采取一切相应的步骤，以使奥地利议会批准的宣言获得国际承认。
    四、奥地利联邦政府将欢迎四大国提出的对奥地利国家领土的完整和不可侵犯性的保证。
    五、奥地利联邦政府将建议法国、英国和美国政府发表关于四大国提供这种保证的声明。”
    莫洛托夫表示相信，美国、法国和英国代表会同意奥地利政府在上述苏奥备忘录的五节中所提出的建议。
    杜勒斯说，美国政府已经知道这一备忘录的内容，美国不反对奥地利遵守备忘录中所陈述的方针。比内和麦克米伦说，他们对奥地利打算发表备忘录中所提到的宣言一事没有原则上的异议，但是他们希望知道奥地利这一宣言的措词。
    莫洛托夫指出，美国、法国和英国的外长已对奥地利按照瑞士那样永远保持中立的意愿表示同意。莫洛托夫说，在这方面，最好还规定四国政府应对奥地利中立宣言做些什么。莫洛托夫宣读了苏联关于四国应为此而发表的相应的声明的草案。声明草案说：“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、美利坚合众国、大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国和法兰西共和国四国政府声明，苏联、美国、英国和法国将尊重和遵守奥地利保持像瑞士在同其他国家的关系中所保持的那种永久中立的状况”。
    杜勒斯说，他认为苏联代表团提出四国声明草案是有益的。他在还没有得悉奥地利议会的看法之前，暂时保留自己的意见。但是，杜勒斯补充说，他在原则上并不反对苏联代表团所提的声明草案。
    比内和麦克米伦也本着同样精神发表了意见。
    接着发言的是费格尔。他说，奥地利政府将把根据莫斯科协议作出的中立宣言提交奥地利议会审查。他还表示愿意把这个宣言的初稿提交参加这次会议的四国代表团。费格尔在回答莫洛托夫的问题——奥地利政府代表团是否要对四国声明草案发表自己的意见时说，奥地利政府完全同意苏联代表团所提的草案。会议一致同意：由奥地利政府代表团向会议提出一项奥地利政府关于中立的宣言的初稿。莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团将向会议提出它所建议的四国声明的书面草案。
    接着会议转入研究有关对奥和约签字程序的问题。会议通过了奥地利代表团团长费格尔关于五月十五日上午十一时三十分在贝尔维德雷宫举行对奥和约签字仪式的建议。
