　　Cultural Exchanges Between Czechoslovakia and China
　　By Pa. Dubovsky, Head of the Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble
    Mutual learning, exchanging experiences, and understanding each other's cultural traditions and people's lives are of paramount importance in our two countries' cultural exchange.
    From the very beginning, Czechoslovakia and the young People's Republic of China have strived for closeness in the development of cultural exchanges. The exhibitions of New China held in Prague, Brno, and Bratislava allowed the Czechoslovak people to understand the life of New China, the revolutionary history of China, and modern Chinese art. This art is developed on the basis of thousands of years of historical tradition, reflecting the vigorous life of the Chinese people. The New China exhibitions were extremely popular with the Czechoslovak people, and people from all over the country requested to visit. The exhibits have been photographed and exhibited throughout the country. The people of Czechoslovakia wrote words of love and admiration for New China in the exhibition's comment books. The exhibitions also inspired the production enthusiasm of factory workers, and many workers wrote letters of determination for production.
    Every year, the work of consolidating and developing cultural exchange has new achievements. After the Czechoslovak cultural delegation led by Dr. Jaroslav Průšek returned home in 1951, thanks to Dr. Průšek's efforts, the Lu Xun Library was established, which is the largest library in Central Europe with a collection of Chinese books. Sinologists and young students can find a wealth of information here. The Lu Xun Library helps enthusiastic Czechoslovak Sinologists to study the treasure trove of Chinese culture and the free life of the Chinese people.
    Art has become a great force for consolidating and strengthening the friendship between our two countries. Art penetrates the hearts of the masses in its own language. Even now, we still remember the performances of the Chinese Youth Art Troupe in Czechoslovakia. They performed brilliant dances and songs, especially the short play "Fighting Side by Side" depicting the Korean battlefield, which demonstrated the unbreakable combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. These performances were extremely popular everywhere, which is a manifestation of the friendship and unity between the people of Czechoslovakia and China. Through various cultural exchanges, the Czechoslovak Film Festival has also been enriched by Chinese films. Chinese Film Week is very popular in Czechoslovakia, making the Czechoslovak people more aware and familiar with China's revolutionary traditions and the current lives of the people. In these respects, the Czechoslovak radio and television stations have also done a lot of work. Social science books and many Czech translations of Chinese texts have also helped us understand various aspects of Chinese life, but this still cannot meet the needs of the masses.
    In recent years, we have published many books of classical and modern Chinese literature. "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" enriched our series of political literature published last year. Dr. Průšek's "History of Liberated Chinese Literature" and translations of some works by Lu Xun and Guo Moruo have recently been extremely popular.
    We have reprinted the "Collection of Classical and Modern Chinese Poetry" compiled by Mathesius. In commemoration of the great Chinese classical poet Qu Yuan, many evenings were held in Czechoslovakia at which we recited his poems and performed parts of the play "Qu Yuan" written by Guo Moruo.
    In order to introduce Chairman Mao's life and works, evenings and discussion meetings were also held throughout Czechoslovakia.
    Since 1951, we have welcomed Chinese musicians, composers, and music theorists to participate in the "Prague Spring" every year. They introduced the traditions of Chinese folk music and the works of modern Chinese composers to the people of Czechoslovakia. Introducing the life of the liberated Chinese people through lectures, music and poetry, and educational and entertaining means through regularly held evenings introducing China throughout the country also played a great role. The unity and friendship between our two countries' villages are developing in Zhangguozhuang and Vinařice. These cultural exchanges are proving what Comrade Zhou Yang said at the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers: "Now we must continue to learn from the heritage left to mankind by the great writers and artists of all ages and countries."

　　捷中两国的文化交流
　　捷克斯洛伐克国家歌舞团团长　帕·杜博夫斯基
    互相学习，交流经验，互相了解文化传统和人民的生活，在我们两国文化交流上有着头等重要的意义。
    捷克斯洛伐克和年青的中华人民共和国在文化交流上的发展，从一开始就互相努力接近。在布拉格、布尔诺和布拉迪斯拉发所举行的新中国展览会，使捷克斯洛伐克的人民了解了新中国的生活、中国的革命历史和中国现代的艺术。这种艺术是在几千年历史传统的基础上发展起来的，它反映了中国人民蓬勃的生活。新中国展览会受到捷克斯洛伐克人民极大的欢迎，全国各地人民都要求参观。这个展览会的陈列品已摄成照片，在全国各地进行展览。捷克斯洛伐克的人民在展览会的意见簿上写下了他们对新中国热爱和钦佩的词句。展览会也鼓舞了工厂工人的生产热情，许多工人写下了生产决心书。
    每年巩固和发展文化交流的工作都有着新的成就。一九五一年以雅洛斯拉夫·普实克博士为首的捷克斯洛伐克文化代表团回国后，由于普实克博士的努力，建立了鲁迅图书馆，这所图书馆是中欧藏有中国书籍的最大的图书馆。汉学家和年青的学生们在这里可以找到丰富的资料。鲁迅图书馆帮助了捷克斯洛伐克热情的汉学家们去研究中国的文化宝库和中国人民自由的生活。
    艺术成为巩固和加强我们两国友谊的伟大力量。艺术以它自己的语言深入到广大群众的心里。直到如今，我们还在回想着中国青年文工团在捷克斯洛伐克的演出。他们演出了精采的舞蹈和歌曲，特别是描写朝鲜战场的短剧“并肩作战”，它表现了中朝两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊。这些节目的演出到处受到极大的欢迎，这是我们捷中两国人民的友谊和团结的表现。通过各种文化上的交流，捷克斯洛伐克的电影节也为中国的电影所丰富了，中国的电影周在捷克斯洛伐克很受欢迎，它使捷克斯洛伐克人民更加了解和熟悉中国的革命传统和人民现在的生活。在这些方面，捷克斯洛伐克的广播电台和电视也做了不少工作。研究汉文的社会科学书籍和许多捷文译本，也帮助我们了解中国各方面的生活，但这还不能满足群众的要求。
    近几年来，我们出版了不少中国古典文学和现代文学的书籍。“毛泽东选集”丰富了我们去年出版的政治文学丛书。普实克博士所写的“解放了的中国文学史”以及鲁迅和郭沫若一些作品的译本，最近受到极大的欢迎。
    我们再版了马泰西尤斯所汇编的“中国古典与现代诗集”。在纪念中国伟大的古典诗人屈原的时候，在捷克斯洛伐克举行了不少晚会，在这些晚会上我们朗诵了他的诗，并演出了郭沫若所写的剧本
  “屈原”的一部分。
    为介绍毛主席的生活和作品，在捷克斯洛伐克各地也举行了晚会和讨论会。
    从一九五一年开始，我们每年欢迎中国的音乐家、作曲家、音乐理论家参加“布拉格之春”。他们把中国民间音乐的传统以及现代中国作曲家的作品介绍给捷克斯洛伐克的人民。通过经常在各地举行的介绍中国的晚会，通过讲演、音乐和诗，通过教育和娱乐的方式介绍解放了的中国人民的生活，也起了很大的作用。我们两国农村的团结和友谊，在张郭庄和维纳尔日采村发展着。这些文化上的交流正证明了周扬同志在中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会上所讲的话：“现在我们必须继续地向各个时代各个国家的人民中的伟大作家、艺术家所遗留给人类的遗产学习。”
