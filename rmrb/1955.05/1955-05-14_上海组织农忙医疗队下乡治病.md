　　Now is the busy season for agriculture. The Shanghai Seventh People's Hospital recently organized an agricultural busy season medical team to go to Xinong Township in Gaoqiao District, a suburban area, to treat sick farmers and reduce the specific difficulties farmers face in seeking medical attention during the busy farming season. At the same time, they are imparting knowledge of hygiene and disease prevention to farmers.

　　The agricultural busy season medical team includes departments of internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology, and is composed of doctors, nurses, midwives, laboratory technicians, and pharmacists from the hospital. The medical team also has a propaganda and education group. In order not to delay farmers' production, the medical team goes to the countryside during the farmers' lunch break, which is also the hospital's lunch break, so it does not affect the hospital's diagnosis and treatment work. Farmers can get their prescriptions filled on the spot after seeing the doctor, and the procedures are very simple. The medical team has also signed medical contracts with eight agricultural production cooperatives, and the medical expenses are paid regularly by the production cooperatives. For households in difficulty, medical expenses can also be reduced or waived as appropriate. This medical team now goes to the countryside twice a week. (Our correspondent in Shanghai)

　　上海组织农忙医疗队下乡治病
    现在正是农忙的季节，上海市立第七人民医院最近组织了一支农忙医疗队，到郊区高桥区新农乡，给患病农民治病，减少农民在农忙期间因病就诊的具体困难；同时向农民传授卫生防疫方面的知识。
    农忙医疗队有内科、外科、小儿科和妇产科，是由医院里医师、护士、助产士、化验员、药剂师组成的。医疗队还有一个宣教小组。为了不耽误农民生产，医疗队都是趁农民吃午饭、同时也是医院午休的时间下乡，这样也不会影响医院的诊疗工作。农民看完病当场就可以配药，手续很简便。医疗队还和八个农业生产合作社订立了医疗合同，医药费统由生产合作社定期汇缴；对于困难户，医药费还可以酌情减免。这个医疗队现在每星期下乡二次。　（本报驻上海记者）
