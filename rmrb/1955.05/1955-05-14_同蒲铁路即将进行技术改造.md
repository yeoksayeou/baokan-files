　　Technical Transformation of the Tongpu Railway to Begin

　　The technical transformation of the Tongpu Railway in Shanxi Province will begin. The surveying work for the technical transformation officially started in early May, and two railway survey and design teams have already arrived at the work site.

　　The Tongpu Railway is more than 860 kilometers long and is divided into northern and southern sections. In the past, the warlord Yan Xishan built it as a narrow-gauge railway in order to maintain his feudal separatist rule. When the Japanese invaders invaded North China, they widened the gauge of the northern section of the Tongpu Railway, but the bridges, roadbeds, and tunnels were not modified, so it still could not run larger locomotives. The southern section is still narrow-gauge. Both the northern and southern sections have many curves and steep slopes, and the transportation capacity is very low, which can no longer meet the needs of the growing industrial and agricultural production along the line. According to the technical transformation plan, some narrow-gauge tracks will be converted to standard gauge, and gradients, curves, and substandard lines will be improved. In addition, some double tracks will be built, and the station yards will be improved and expanded, and technical equipment will be increased. After the technical transformation of the Tongpu Railway is completed, the transportation capacity will be greatly improved. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　同蒲铁路即将进行技术改造
    山西省同蒲铁路将进行技术改造。技术改造的勘测工作在五月初正式开始，有两支铁道勘察设计队伍已经到达工作地点。
    同蒲铁路全长八百六十多公里，分南北两段。过去军阀阎锡山为了维持他的封建割据，将它修成窄轨铁路。日寇侵略华北时，曾把同蒲线北段轨距拨宽，但桥梁、路基和隧道并没有改动，仍然不能行驶较大机车。南段现在仍然是窄轨。南北两段弯多、坡陡，运输能力很低，已经不能适应沿线工农业生产增长的要求。按照这次技术改造的计划，部分窄轨将改成宽轨，坡度、弯道和不合标准的线路都将改善，并将修建部分复线，改善和扩大站场，增加技术设备。同蒲铁路技术改造全部完成以后，运输能力将大大提高。　（新华社）
