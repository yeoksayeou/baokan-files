A Shanghai Jiangwan District Changbai New Village Child Healthcare Center, specializing in protecting the health of children in workers' residential areas, was established on the eve of "June 1st" International Children's Day. In the first quarter of 1955, Shanghai First Medical College and Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau had already established two child healthcare centers. Now, dozens of hospitals and child healthcare institutions throughout the city are working to protect children's health.
	Chen Cuizhen, Dean of the Pediatric Department of Shanghai First Medical College, who has been engaged in child healthcare for more than 30 years, told reporters: Under the care of the Party and the government, the health and growth development of children in Shanghai has far exceeded the level before liberation. Smallpox, a serious infectious disease that threatened children's lives, has not been found for more than four years. Diphtheria has also been basically eliminated this year.
	Chen Cuizhen said: In recent years, the gradual improvement of people's material living standards has had a direct impact on enhancing children's physical fitness. Now, nine universities and hospitals in Shanghai have begun scientific research on the physical development of infants and young children in Shanghai during the first five-year plan period, as a basis for further improving child healthcare work in the future.

　　上海市儿童保健事业日益发展
    一个专门保护工人住宅区儿童健康的上海市江湾区长白新村儿童保健所，在“六一”国际儿童节前夕成立。上海第一医学院和上海市卫生局在一九五五年第一季度已建立了两个儿童保健所。现在全市已有几十个医院和儿童保健机构在为保护儿童健康进行工作。
    从事三十多年儿童保健工作的上海第一医学院儿科学院院长陈翠贞对记者说：在党和政府的关怀下，上海儿童的健康和生长发育情况已远远超过解放以前的水平。严重威胁儿童生命的天花传染病早在四年多前就没有发现了。到今年白喉也已基本上消灭。
    陈翠贞说：几年来，人民物质生活水平逐步提高对增强儿童体质有直接影响。现在上海有九个高等学校和医院开始进行第一个五年计划期间上海婴儿幼儿身体发育情况的科学研究，作为今后进一步改进儿童保健工作的依据。（新华社）
