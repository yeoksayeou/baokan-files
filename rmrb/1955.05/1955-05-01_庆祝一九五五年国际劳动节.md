　　Celebrating the 1955 International Labor Day
　　Kurt Meier, Secretary of the National Executive Committee of the Federation of Free German Trade Unions
    May 1st is the day for the international proletariat to fight for workers' rights, national independence, and peace.

    This year's May Day is a symbol of the firm determination of the working people of the German Democratic Republic to defend peace, reunify Germany, establish a European collective security system, and strive for greater achievements in consolidating our worker-peasant regime and building socialism. This day will become a powerful demonstration of the solidarity of the entire German working class and other working people against the Paris war agreement and for a nationwide referendum.

    The trade unions of the German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, shoulder a significant task in this struggle. The reactionary rulers in Bonn would rather abandon the path of peaceful reunification of Germany and embark on the path of direct war preparation, provocation, and aggression. In order to guarantee the maximum profits for West Germany and American imperialists, and to satisfy their desires for conquest, they have betrayed the national interests of the German people and adopted an adventurous war policy. This has created a serious new situation in Germany, and has also greatly increased and strengthened the responsibilities and roles of German workers and trade unions.

    Peace-loving people will express their immense hatred for the atomic war believers on May 1st and strengthen their confidence that the power of the masses can overcome the atomic strategy. The unshakable foundation of our worker-peasant regime—the working class in alliance with the working peasants—will, together with all patriotic forces of the German Democratic Republic, once again show that they are not only able to build socialism victoriously, but also determined to prevent any destruction of the achievements of their worker-peasant state by the Bonn war-mongers and their American masters. The majority of the German people, especially the working class, are against the policy of war preparation and aggression, and against the policy of deepening the division of Germany. The militant May Day demonstration will eloquently prove this. The majority of people in East and West Germany want their motherland to regain unity and want to live in an environment of peace and friendship among all peoples. Therefore, they oppose the remilitarization of West Germany.

    The West German working class has also begun to change. The powerful strike movements that unfolded in many regions of West Germany last year, especially the large-scale strike in the Ruhr area in January this year, and the increasing number of warning strikes against the war-mongers and militarists, clearly show this change. The West German working class is gradually recognizing its own strength and standing at the forefront against the Paris Agreement. The united action of the West German working class remains the main condition for abolishing the Paris Agreement and stopping the rearmament of German militarists.

    Participating in these significant strike movements against the conspiracies of war-mongers and militarists are Social Democrats, Communists, non-party workers, and Christian workers in West Germany. This shows that a large part of the West German working class has realized that unity of action is the most important weapon in the struggle and is working to make it a reality.

    In one part of Germany—the German Democratic Republic—the working class and working peasants have formed an alliance and are cooperating with intellectuals in a comradely manner, eliminating the monopoly capitalists, financial tycoons, and Junker landlords, and transforming the German Democratic Republic into a strong fortress of peace and democracy. The German Democratic Republic has set an example for West German patriots in defending the national interests of the entire German people. The growing number of West German worker delegations visiting the German Democratic Republic, who have witnessed the beautiful new life here, has also greatly disturbed the enemies of the German people.

    The German proletariat bears a major responsibility to the international working class in resolving the vital issues of the German nation. The German working class is not isolated in this struggle. In his speech in Berlin in July 1954, the Premier of the People's Republic of China, speaking of the German people's struggle for a peaceful, unified, democratic, and independent Germany, said: "The Chinese Government and people are very concerned about and fully support the just struggle of the German people to achieve a peaceful solution to the unification of their country." This is how our people have gained the help and support of powerful China in the struggle to resolve the vital issues of the German nation. Due to the German Democratic Republic government's unwavering adherence to a peaceful policy, we have established friendship with the Chinese people. The peace policy of the German Democratic Republic has convinced the people of all countries of the peace-loving strength of the German people. Close, brotherly friendship links the German working class and other working people with the Chinese workers and peasants. They congratulate the entire Chinese people on their further achievements in the cause of socialist construction. The growing political, economic, and cultural ties between our two peoples are of great help to the socialist construction of our two countries.

    In the powerful world peace camp led by the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, the Chinese and German people stand shoulder to shoulder in the struggle to defend world peace and strive for a happy future for mankind.

    On the occasion of the May 1st International Labor Day, the German people extend fraternal fighting greetings to the Chinese people and wish them great new achievements in the struggle for socialist construction and the defense of peace.

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and German people!

　　庆祝一九五五年国际劳动节
　　自由德国工会联合会全国执行委员会书记　库尔特·麦耶尔
    五月一日是国际无产阶级争取工人权利、争取民族独立、争取和平的斗争日。
    今年的五一节，是德意志民主共和国劳动人民表示他们为保卫和平、重新统一德国、建立欧洲集体安全体系，为进一步巩固我国工农政权和在建设社会主义基础中获得更大成就而努力的坚强决心的标志。这一天将成为全德工人阶级和其他劳动人民团结一致反对巴黎战争协定和争取在全德举行人民投票的强大示威。
    在德国统一社会党领导下的德意志民主共和国工会，在这个斗争中肩负着重大的任务。波恩反动统治者宁愿抛弃和平统一德国的道路，而走上直接备战、挑衅和侵略的道路。为了保证西德和美国帝国主义者的最大利润，为了满足他们的征服欲望，他们出卖了德国人民的民族利益，采取了冒险的战争政策。这就在德国造成了一个严重的新局势，同时也大大地加重和加强了德意志民主共和国工人和工会的责任和作用。
    爱好和平的人民将在五月一日表示他们对原子战争信徒的无比憎恨，并加强他们对人民群众的力量定能战胜原子战略的信心。我们工农政权不可动摇的基础——与劳动农民结成联盟的工人阶级，将和德意志民主共和国所有爱国力量一道，再一次显示出他们不仅能够胜利地建设社会主义，而且也有决心防止波恩战争贩子及其美国主子对他们工农国家成果的任何破坏。大多数德国人民，首先是工人阶级，是反对备战和侵略政策、反对加深分裂德国的政策的。具有战斗性的五一节示威将雄辩地证明这一点。东西德大多数人民都愿他们的祖国重新获得统一，愿意生活在和平和各国人民友好的环境里。因此，他们反对西德重新军国主义化。
    西德工人阶级也开始有了转变。去年在西德许多地区展开的强大的罢工运动以及特别是今年一月鲁尔区的大罢工和日益增多的向战争贩子和军国主义分子提出的警告性罢工，都清楚地显示了这一转变。西德工人阶级正在逐渐认识到自己的力量，并站在反对巴黎协定的最前列。西德工人阶级的行动一致仍然是废除巴黎协定和制止德国军国主义分子重新武装起来的主要条件。
    参加这些具有重大意义的反对战争贩子和军国主义分子阴谋的罢工运动的，有西德的社会民主党人、共产党人、无党派工人和基督教工人。这就表明，西德工人阶级中的大部分人已认识到行动一致是斗争的最重要武器，正在努力促使它实现。
    在德国的一部分——德意志民主共和国，工人阶级和劳动农民结成联盟并和知识分子进行同志般的合作，消灭了垄断资本家、金融巨头和容克地主，并把德意志民主共和国变成为和平民主的坚强堡垒。德意志民主共和国为西德爱国者树立了捍卫全德人民的民族利益的榜样。愈来愈多的访问德意志民主共和国的西德工人代表团，亲眼看到了这里的美好的新生活，这也使德国人民的敌人大为不安。
    在解决德意志民族切身问题上，德国无产阶级对国际工人阶级担负着重大的责任。在这个斗争中德国工人阶级并不是孤立的。中华人民共和国总理一九五四年七月在柏林所作的演说中谈到德国人民争取建立和平、统一、民主和独立的德国的斗争时曾说：“中国政府和人民十分关切和全力支持德国人民为争取和平解决自己的国家统一问题的正义斗争。”我国人民就是这样在解决德意志民族切身问题的斗争中获得强大的中国的帮助和支持的。由于德意志民主共和国政府信守不渝地执行和平政策，我们已同中国人民建立了友谊。德意志民主共和国政府的和平政策使各国人民相信德国人民爱好和平的力量。亲密的兄弟般的友谊把德国工人阶级和其他劳动人民和中国工人与农民联系在一起。他们祝全中国人民在社会主义建设事业中获得进一步的成就。我们两国人民在政治、经济、文化方面日益加强的联系，是对于我们两国的社会主义建设的很大帮助。
    在以伟大的社会主义国家苏联为首的强大的世界和平阵营中，中德两国人民并肩为捍卫世界和平和争取人类幸福的未来而斗争。
    德国人民在五一国际劳动节时向中国人民致以兄弟的战斗敬礼，并祝他们在社会主义建设和保卫和平的斗争中获得巨大的新成就。
    中德两国人民的友谊万岁！
