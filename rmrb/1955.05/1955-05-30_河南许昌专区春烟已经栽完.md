The spring tobacco planting in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, a famous flue-cured tobacco production area, has been completed. This year's tobacco planting technology has improved compared to previous years. Many tobacco farmers have accepted the scientific guidance of local technical guidance stations and changed from direct seeding to transplanting. All 600 mu of early tobacco in eleven agricultural production cooperatives in Changzhuang Township, Xuchang County, adopted transplanting, and the number of plants per mu increased from 1,300 to 1,500. The township plans to increase leaf tobacco production by 30% compared to last year. The 160,000 mu of spring tobacco in Xiang County are also growing vigorously.

Now, tobacco farmers are actively preparing to plant wheat stubble tobacco and have bought "666" powder from supply and marketing cooperatives to kill insects and protect the healthy growth of tobacco seedlings. (Our correspondent in Zhengzhou)

　  河南许昌专区春烟已经栽完
    著名烤烟产区——河南省许昌专区的春烟已经栽完了。今年栽烟的技术比往年又有提高。许多烟农接受了当地技术指导站的科学指导，改直播为移苗栽培法，许昌县常庄乡十一个农业生产合作社的六百多亩早烟全部采用移苗栽培，每亩并从一千三百棵增加到一千五百棵，全乡计划比去年增产叶烟百分之三十，襄县全县十六万多亩春烟也生长得很旺盛。
    现在，烟农们都在一面积极准备栽麦茬烟，一面从供销社买回了“六六六”粉，准备杀虫，保护烟叶幼苗健全生长。　（本报驻郑州记者）
