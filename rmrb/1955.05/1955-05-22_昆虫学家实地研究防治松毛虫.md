Entomologists Conduct Field Research on Pine Caterpillar Control

The Ministry of Forestry, the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of Forestry Science have jointly organized a pine caterpillar research team composed of entomological experts and technicians. This team began conducting field research in Dong'an County, Hunan Forestry Area, in March of last year, studying the patterns of pine caterpillar occurrence, chemical control, and biological control. They have now basically determined the patterns of pine caterpillar occurrence and the occurrence of pine caterpillar's natural enemies. They have also studied advanced Soviet experiences, focusing on observations of the breeding and utilization of *Trichogramma dendrolimi* for biological control, and combining this with research on various drug efficacy tests. This research team built a new insect rearing shed in March of this year and purchased a large number of scientific research instruments. This year, they also plan to select key areas for small-scale release experiments of *Trichogramma dendrolimi* for biological control. The bird survey team of the Institute of Zoology of the Academy of Sciences will also send specialists to assist in investigating beneficial birds that peck at pine caterpillars.

　　昆虫学家实地研究防治松毛虫
    林业部，中国科学院昆虫研究所和林业科学研究所三个单位，共同组织昆虫学专家和技术人员，成立了松毛虫研究工作组。这个工作组从去年三月开始在湖南林业区东安县实地研究松毛虫发生规律、药剂防治和生物防治，现已基本上摸清了松毛虫发生的规律和松毛虫的天敌发生的情况。他们并学习了苏联先进经验，着重进行了生物防治的黑卵蜂培养和利用上的观察，并结合各种不同的药效试验进行研究。这个工作组在今年三月新建了一栋养虫棚并添购了大批科学研究仪器。今年还计划选择重点地区，作生物防治的黑卵蜂小规模的放蜂试验。科学院动物研究所的鸟类调查组也将派专人来配合调查啄食松毛虫的益鸟。　（本报驻长沙记者）
