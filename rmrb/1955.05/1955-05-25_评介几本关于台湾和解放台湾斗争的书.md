　　Reviewing Several Books on Taiwan and the Struggle to Liberate Taiwan
　　Wang Dabai

　　In the current great struggle to liberate Taiwan, compiling and publishing popular books on Taiwan and the struggle to liberate Taiwan is an important means of mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of people to actively participate in and victoriously complete this historic undertaking. In recent years, especially in the past half year, the publishing industry has published many books on this subject. The more important ones include: "Taiwan" (by Wu Zhuangda, published by China Youth Publishing House), "Today's Taiwan" (edited by Lin Chu, published by People's Publishing House), "A History of American Aggression Against Taiwan" (by Qing Ruji, published by China Youth Publishing House), "American Aggression Against Taiwan" (by Zheng Liufang, published by World Knowledge Press), and "Looking at the International Situation from the Struggle to Liberate Taiwan" (compiled by Shi Lü, published by Popular Reading Materials Publishing House). These books are closely linked to current political tasks and explain the general situation of Taiwan and American aggression against Taiwan. They are of certain significance for the broad masses of people to have a more comprehensive understanding of Taiwan and the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

　　Taiwan has always been Chinese territory. Some books have made preliminary explorations into the history of Taiwan. "Taiwan" and "American Aggression Against Taiwan" use historical facts to show that Taiwan had relations with the mainland as early as the Qin and Han dynasties; after the Tang and Song dynasties, the people of the southeastern coast began peaceful economic development work in Taiwan; in the 12th and 14th centuries, Penghu and Taiwan Island officially became part of our administrative region. Over hundreds of years, the common labor of the Han people and the Taiwanese brothers and sisters has developed Taiwan into a beautiful and rich island. On the land of Taiwan, the blood and sweat of countless ancestors flowed. In the early 17th century, the forces of Western colonialism expanded towards the Pacific and Asian continents, so our territory of Taiwan was first invaded. Under the rule of Dutch and Spanish colonialists, the Taiwanese people launched many heroic uprisings against foreign oppression. In 1661, the national hero Zheng Chenggong led his troops to expel the Dutch colonialists who had occupied Taiwan, completing the great task of restoring the homeland. In 1895, the corrupt and incompetent Qing government was defeated by Japan, and Taiwan once again fell into the hands of Japanese imperialism. During the 51 years of Japanese occupation of Taiwan, the Taiwanese people never stopped their heroic resistance. The great War of Resistance Against Japan by the Chinese people finally brought about the shameful destruction of Japanese colonial rule. These historical facts show that under the resistance of the heroic people, the rule of Western or Eastern colonialists ended in their own shameful destruction, and the righteous struggle has always been victorious in the end.

　　Some books, especially "Taiwan," provide preliminary materials for the study of Taiwan's economy, explaining the hindering effect of long-term foreign rule on Taiwan's economic development. Taiwan, this rich producer of rice and sugar cane, the land of fruits, the flourishing tea garden, and the world's camphor "kingdom," was an important link in the economic ties of the motherland in the first half of the 19th century. Its rich products not only supplied the needs of the southeastern coast and the Yangtze River basin, but also were transported to the north, and some were shipped to Guangzhou and other places (cited material see page 4 of "A History of American Aggression Against Taiwan"). After 1895, it was chained to the economic system of Japanese imperialism and became an important raw material production base and market for Japan; the amount of rice alone transported to Japan reached nearly 10 million hectoliters at its peak. What Japanese imperialism paid attention to "developing" was only agriculture, and industry was still "built on a pile of shaky floating soil." However, Taiwan also has the resource conditions for developing industry; the very unbalanced characteristic of industry and agriculture in Taiwan's economic development is a scar left by Japanese colonial rule. The nearly ten years of the US-Chiang rule has deepened this scar, stifling the vitality of Taiwan's economy both in industry and agriculture. For example, under the reactionary rule of the US-Chiang, even the output of rice and sugar cane is far lower than the level during the Japanese occupation.

　　In "Today's Taiwan" and the two books discussing the history and current situation of American aggression against Taiwan, we can see the truth about the Kuomintang traitorous clique's evil rule approaching its end, and we can discern the consistent conspiracy of American aggression against Taiwan and its development, especially the cruel essence of the current stage. Some of the numerical materials cited in these books (these materials were originally published in reactionary newspapers and periodicals, and the numbers were obviously greatly reduced) reflect a glimpse of the bloody rule of the US-Chiang. For example, the amount of money extorted from the Taiwanese people by Chiang's bandits in various exorbitant taxes and levies increased more than 22 times in 1953 compared with 1949. Under such harsh taxes and levies, the Taiwanese people lived in extreme poverty. 89 percent of salt workers were in debt, 56 percent of urban residents' families lived on borrowing, and tenant farmers' annual income per household was less than half of that in 1937 during the Japanese occupation. The average annual income of ordinary farmers was only enough to eat for one or two months. The Taiwanese people are struggling on the verge of starvation. This is the result of the Chiang gang's execution of the "permanent strategy of the United States" through marrow-sucking exploitation, and the result of the American aggressors' militarization of Taiwan's economy. American aggressors are carrying out direct and cruel plunder in Taiwan. For example, the United States, through the so-called "US Aid" plan, raised the price ratio of chemical fertilizers to rice, which plundered a large amount of rice from Taiwan. The large amount of rice plundered was then exported to Japan, which became another component of the comprehensive plan of the United States to revive Japanese militarism. "American Aggression Against Taiwan" correctly pointed out that in this way, "American imperialism not only makes Taiwan's economy directly serve its own war plans, but also uses Taiwan's resources to develop Japan's military industry under American control, turning Taiwan into a commodity market for Japan," serving its own economic and military interests, and constantly strengthening its military occupation and economic control of Taiwan.

　　American aggression and interference in China has created a tense situation in the Taiwan region and the Far East. "Looking at the International Situation from the Struggle to Liberate Taiwan" focuses on analyzing and discussing this issue. The author pointed out that because the American aggressive clique is now occupying Taiwan, openly interfering in our country's internal affairs, and wants to force us to give up the struggle to liberate Taiwan, the author analyzed the international situation surrounding this struggle, exposed the various conspiracies and tricks played by the American aggressive clique and its essentially strong but inwardly weak nature, and criticized the erroneous ideas of confusing internal affairs with international issues, fearing the threat of war and atomic blackmail, and so on. The author further proved that our just struggle is invincible from the weakness of the enemy from within, from the favorable conditions of the international situation, especially from the unparalleled prestige and power of the peaceful and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and from our own internal strength.

　　The advantages of these books are basic. However, they also have some shortcomings and errors. The main ones are: some books have obvious one-sidedness in content or individual viewpoints. For example, although "Today's Taiwan" uses rich materials to demonstrate the tyrannical and brutal rule of the US-Chiang and the tragic lives of the Taiwanese people, it lacks materials to illustrate the inevitable weaknesses of the US-Chiang reactionary rule, and it has not collected as much material as possible to reflect the major and minor struggles of the Taiwanese people under the US-Chiang rule. "A History of American Aggression Against Taiwan" is a rather powerful indictment of US imperialism, exposing the consistent conspiracies and crimes of the United States in its aggression against Taiwan over the past century with relatively rich materials. However, the author made mistakes of one-sidedness in dealing with the past crimes of Japanese imperialism against our country, in dealing with the historical relationship between the US and Japanese imperialists, and even in dealing with the relationship between imperialists. When analyzing the foreign expansion of Japanese imperialism in the last quarter of the last century, the author lacked sufficient attention to the main aspect, that is, the development law of Japanese imperialism. Therefore, the author described a series of Japanese aggressive activities as if they were all "acting as accomplices to the tiger in order to profit from it." Even the Sino-Japanese War launched by Japanese militarists was said to be purely an action of certain external forces "using the Japanese as cannon fodder," which is inappropriate. The author also did not grasp Lenin's point that "they are undermining each other on every issue" when dealing with the relationship between the Japanese and US imperialists and the relationship between imperialists. Therefore, the author not only rendered this historical relationship into a harmonious situation that did not conform to historical reality, but also called Britain's trick in the 1874 Japanese invasion of Taiwan a "'honest'" mediation, and the trick played by the United States as "maliciously slandering Britain and European countries." Obviously, Taiwan was then an "apple of discord," and what many robbers were playing was nothing more than the trick of "undermining each other," so the so-called "'honest' mediation" this argument is harmful. The one-sidedness in individual viewpoints is also reflected in the book "Taiwan." For example, the author repeatedly emphasized the lack of natural fertility of Taiwan's land, but did not appropriately point out that the root cause of this lack of fertility is also related to the severe devastation of Taiwan's land by long-term Japanese colonial rule and the neglect of land maintenance.

　　Some books also lack due inspection when citing materials. For example, "American Aggression Against Taiwan" quoted a passage from the British "Economist" magazine to illustrate Britain's attitude towards American aggression against Taiwan. This passage declared that the US aggression against Taiwan "did not receive British support" and "did not receive British moral and political support." Of course, we have always hoped and welcomed that Britain can adopt such an attitude of only supporting justice and not supporting any form of American aggression; however, it is regrettable that, until now, Britain has not only failed to adopt such an attitude, but has instead adopted an attitude of supporting the American occupation of our territory of Taiwan. Therefore, citing such materials in this book is at least inconsistent with the facts.

　　In addition, in these books, we can often find information with mutually inconsistent figures, which is a common shortcoming in today's publications. In order to improve the scientific level of publications, we urgently need to establish a system in publications - an authoritative information system. This is worthy of attention from the writing and publishing circles.

　　评介几本关于台湾和解放台湾斗争的书
　　王大白
    在当前解放台湾的伟大斗争中，编写出版关于台湾和解放台湾斗争的通俗读物，是动员和组织广大人民积极参加和胜利完成这一历史性事业的重要手段。近年来，特别是近半年来，出版界曾出版了不少有关这一方面的书籍。其中较主要的有：“台湾”（吴壮达著、中国青年出版社出版），“今日台湾”（林初编著、人民出版社出版），“美国侵略台湾史”（卿汝楫著、中国青年出版社出版），
  “美国对台湾的侵略”（郑留芳著、世界知识社出版）和“从解放台湾的斗争看国际形势”（施旅编写、通俗读物出版社出版）等。这些书同现实政治任务密切结合，阐述了关于台湾和美国侵略台湾的一般情况，对于广大人民比较全面地了解台湾和解放台湾的斗争，是有一定的意义的。
    台湾从来就是中国的领土。有些书中对于台湾的历史，作了初步的探讨。“台湾”和“美国对台湾的侵略”两书，根据史实说明：远自秦汉，台湾就和祖国大陆发生了关系；唐宋以后，东南沿海人民开始了在台湾的和平经济开发工作；在十二世纪和十四世纪，澎湖和台湾本岛就先后正式成为我国行政区的一部分。几百年中，汉族人民和台湾兄弟民族人民共同的劳动，把台湾开发成为一座美丽而富庶的岛屿。在台湾的土地上，流过无数先民的血汗。十七世纪初，西方殖民主义者势力向太平洋和亚洲大陆一带扩展，因此，我国领土台湾首先遭到侵扰。在荷兰殖民主义者和西班牙殖民主义者的统治下，台湾人民举行了许多次反抗外族压迫的英勇起义。一六六一年，民族英雄郑成功率领军队，驱逐了侵占台湾的荷兰殖民主义者，完成了光复国土的大业。一八九五年，腐败无能的满清政府被日本战败，台湾又一次落到日本帝国主义者的手里。在日本占领台湾的五十一年间，台湾人民始终没有停止过英勇的反抗斗争。中国人民伟大的抗日战争，终于使日本殖民统治遭到了可耻的覆灭。这些历史事实表明：在英勇人民的抗争之下，不论西方的或东方的殖民主义者的统治都以自己的可耻的覆灭而终场，从来的正义斗争最后都是胜利的。
    在有些书中，特别是在“台湾”一书中，提供了台湾经济研究的初步材料，说明了长期的外国统治对台湾经济发展所起的阻碍作用。台湾，这个稻米和蔗糖的丰饶产地、水果之乡、茂盛的茶园以及世界上的樟脑“王国”，在十九世纪上半叶时，就是祖国经济纽带上的重要一环。它的丰饶的物产不仅供应了东南沿海和长江流域的需要，而且输送到北方，有的还运往广州等地（引证材料见“美国侵略台湾史”四页）。在一八九五年以后，它被拴上日本帝国主义经济体系的链条，成为日本一个重要的原料产地和市场；仅稻米一宗运到日本本土的，最高时近千万公石。日本帝国主义所注意“开发”的只是农业，工业还是“建立在一堆动摇的浮土上”。但是，台湾同样拥有发展工业的资源条件；台湾经济发展上的工农业很不平衡的特点，是日本殖民统治留下的斑痕。近十年的美蒋统治更加深了这种斑痕，既在工业上，又在农业上扼杀了台湾经济的生机。例如，在美蒋的反动统治下，即使稻米和蔗糖的产量也大大地低于日本侵占时期的水平。
      在“今日台湾”和讨论美国侵略台湾的历史和现况的两本书中，我们可以看到蒋介石卖国集团临于末日的罪恶统治的真情，可以辨识出美国侵略台湾的一贯阴谋及其发展，特别是现阶段的凶残实质。这几本书中引证的某些数字材料（这些材料原来发表在反动报刊上，数字显然是被大大缩小了的），就反映了美蒋血腥统治的一斑。例如，蒋贼用各种苛捐杂税向台湾人民勒索的数额，一九五三年就比一九四九年增加了二十二倍以上。在这样的苛征暴敛之下，台湾人民生活贫困不堪。盐工负债的占百分之八十九，城市居民中借债度日的家庭占百分之五十六，佃农每户每年收入不及日本侵占时期一九三七年的一半，一般农户每年的平均收入只够吃一两个月的饭。台湾人民挣扎在饥饿线上，这是蒋贼集团用敲骨吸髓的压榨来执行“美国的永久战略”的结果，是美国侵略者把台湾经济军事化的结果。美国侵略者更在台湾进行直接的残酷掠夺。例如，美国通过所谓“美援”计划，提高化学肥料同大米的比价，这就掠夺了台湾大量的大米。大量掠夺去的大米则输出到日本，这又成为美国复活日本军国主义全面计划中的一个组成部分。“美国对台湾的侵略”一书正确指出：这样，“美国帝国主义不仅使台湾的经济直接替自己的战争计划服务，而且还利用台湾的资源来发展美国控制下的日本的军需工业，把台湾变成日本的商品市场”，为自己的经济和军事利益服务，并不断加强其对台湾的军事占领和经济控制。
    美国对中国的侵略和干涉，造成了台湾地区和远东的紧张局势。“从解放台湾的斗争看国际局势”一书着重地分析和论述了这个问题。作者指出：由于美国侵略集团现在侵占着台湾，公然干涉我国的内政问题，想压迫我们放弃解放台湾的斗争，作者分析了围绕着这个斗争所产生的国际局势，揭露了美国侵略集团所玩弄的各种阴谋诡计及其色厉内荏的实质，批判了混淆内政问题同国际问题、害怕战争威胁和原子讹诈等等错误的思想。作者更从敌人内部的虚弱上，从国际局势的有利条件，特别是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的无比威望和威力上，从我们自己的内部力量上，证明了我们的正义斗争是不可战胜的。
    这些书的优点是基本的。但是，它们还有一些缺点和错误。主要的是：有些书在内容上或个别观点上，带有显明的片面性。例如，“今日台湾”虽以丰富的材料论证了美蒋统治的专横暴虐和台湾人民的悲惨生活，却缺乏材料说明美蒋反动统治不可避免的弱点，也没有尽可能搜集一些材料来反映台湾人民在美蒋统治下或大或小的斗争。“美国侵略台湾史”一书以比较充实的材料揭露了美国百年来侵略台湾的一贯阴谋和罪行，是一本相当有力的对美帝国主义的控诉书。但作者在处理过去日本帝国主义对我国的侵略罪行、在处理美日两帝国主义者间的历史关系乃至在处理帝国主义者间的关系时，犯了片面性的毛病。作者在分析日本帝国主义在上世纪后四分之一时期的对外扩张时，对主要的一面，即日本帝国主义的发展规律，缺乏足够的重视。因此，作者把日本一系列的侵略活动说成仿佛都是“为虎作伥，以便从中取利”。甚至把日本军国主义者发动的甲午战争也说成仿佛单纯是某些外部力量“利用日本人为炮灰”的行动，这是不恰当的。作者在处理日、美两帝国主义者的关系和帝国主义者间的关系时，也没有掌握列宁所指出的“他们在每个问题上都是彼此互相拆台的”的一面。因此，作者既把这种历史关系渲染成为不符历史真实的水乳交融的情况，更把英国对一八七四年日军侵台事件中所玩弄的把戏称为“‘诚实’的”调停，把美国所玩弄的把戏称为“恶意中伤英国及欧洲各国”。显然，台湾当时正是一只“纠纷的苹果”，许多强盗所玩弄的无非是“彼此互相拆台”的把戏，因此，所谓“‘诚实’的调停”这种论断是有害的。个别观点上的片面性也表现在“台湾”一书中。例如，作者一再强调台湾土地天然肥力的不足，而没有适当指出这种肥力不足的根源也同日本长期殖民统治对台湾土地的惨重蹂躏、对土地保养的忽视有关。
    有些书在引证材料时还缺乏应有的检验。例如，“美国对台湾的侵略”一书引用了英国“经济学家”周刊的一段言论，来说明英国对美国侵略台湾的态度。这段言论宣称美国对台湾的侵略行为
  “没有获得英国的支持”，“更得不到英国道义上和政治上的支持”。固然我们一直希望并欢迎英国能采取这样的只支持正义，而不支持任何形式的美国侵略行为的态度；然而很可惋惜的是：直到现在为止，英国不但没有采取这样的态度，反而采取了支持美国侵占我国领土台湾的态度。因此，这本书引用这种材料至少是同事实不符的。
    此外，在这些书中，我们往往还可以发现一些数字互不相符的资料，这是今天出版物中普遍存在的缺点。为了提高出版物的科学水平，我们亟须在出版物中建立一项制度——权威资料制度。这一点是值得著作界和出版界注意的。
