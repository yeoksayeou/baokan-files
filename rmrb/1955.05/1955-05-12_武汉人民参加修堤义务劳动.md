　　Wuhan People Participate in Voluntary Dike Repair Labor
    The cadres of Wuhan city's organizations, students above senior high school, and residents of the streets enthusiastically participate in voluntary labor to repair dikes, assisting the civilian workers to strive to complete the dike repair project before the flood season. From April 24th to around May 6th, more than 40,000 people had gone to the dikes. Every morning, the people participating in voluntary labor came to various dike sections and began their hard work. On rainy days, they overcame difficulties such as muddy roads and worked alongside the dike workers in the rain to repair the dikes. Many units also carried out labor competitions to strive to overfulfill their tasks. Elderly residents who did not participate in voluntary labor also arranged household chores and took care of children at home, so that young people could concentrate on repairing the dikes.

　　武汉人民参加修堤义务劳动
    武汉市机关干部、高中以上学生和街道居民踊跃参加修筑堤防的义务劳动，协助民工争取在汛前完成堤防修筑工程。从四月二十四日至五月六日前后已有四万多人上堤。每天清晨，参加义务劳动的人们都纷纷来到各堤段，开始辛勤的劳动。雨天，他们克服了道路泥泞等困难，同堤防工人一道冒雨修堤。许多单位还开展劳动竞赛，争取超额完成任务。居民中没有参加义务劳动的老年人也都在家里安排家务和照顾孩子，使青年人能安心修堤。
