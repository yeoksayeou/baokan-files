Over a dozen projects in the first phase of the construction of the factory area and front area of the newly built state-owned Jiamusi Paper Mill have commenced successively. Efforts will be made to complete most of these projects in the first half of this year to prepare for the second phase of construction scheduled to begin in the second half of the year, which includes several main factory buildings such as chemical, cooking, and paper-making workshops.

This large-scale paper mill will produce industrial paper urgently needed in our country, such as cement bag paper, insulation paper for wrapping cables, and machine packaging paper. The factory will adopt the latest paper-making technology during production. All production workshops and the central dispatch room of the paper mill's chemical plant will be equipped with a complete set of automatic indicating and recording instruments. The most difficult technologies related to the acidity and alkalinity of pulp, pulp concentration, paper machine speed, and web breaks will also be controlled by automatic indication, automatic control, and automatic signal devices. The several huge underground pumping stations that supply the entire factory with paper-making water will be operated by management personnel in pumping stations hundreds of meters away. The factory's waste materials will also be fully utilized. The chemical workshop can recover 90 percent of the caustic soda and sodium sulfide from the used waste alkaline liquor. The rosin contained in pine wood can also be made into turpentine and saponified substances to supply paint factories and soap factories.

The Jiamusi Paper Mill's workshops will also have complete ventilation systems and welfare facilities such as rest rooms, shower rooms, and locker rooms. The foul-smelling sulfide gas that workers used to smell all day long in the pulping workshops of old paper mills will be collected and burned by special devices in this factory, thus the air in the workshops will be fresh.

　　国营佳木斯造纸厂十几项工程开工
    新建国营佳木斯造纸厂厂区和厂前区第一批十几项工程陆续开工。这批工程争取在今年上半年大部完成，以便迎接下半年开工的第二批包括化学、蒸煮、抄纸等几座主厂房的建设任务。
    这个规模巨大的造纸厂，将制造我国迫切需要的工业用纸，如水泥袋纸、包扎电缆用的绝缘纸和机器包装纸等。工厂生产时，将采用最新的造纸技术。造纸厂化工厂的各个生产车间和中央调度室中，都将装备一套完备的自动指示和记录仪表。有关纸浆的酸碱度、纸浆的浓度、纸机的速度和断头等最困难的技术，也分别设有自动指示、自动控制和自动讯号等装置来控制。供应全厂造纸用水的几个巨大的地下水泵房，将来都是由管理人员在远离它几百公尺外的扬水站中操纵。这个厂的废料也将得到充分的利用，化学车间可以从用过的废碱液中把百分之九十的烧碱和硫化碱收回来。还可以把松木中含的松脂制成松节油和皂化物，供给油漆工厂和肥皂工厂使用。
    佳木斯造纸厂各车间里，还将有完备的通风系统和休息室、淋浴室、更衣室等福利设施。工人们在旧的造纸工厂制浆车间整天闻到的一股恶臭的硫化物的气体，这个厂都设有专门的装置把它收集起来燃烧掉，因而车间里空气新鲜。　（新华社）
