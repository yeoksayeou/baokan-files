　　Advancing on the Socialist Road
　　Nineteen Major State-Owned Electric Power Industry Projects Begin Construction
　　By the end of April, nineteen major power generation, transmission, and substation projects of China's state-owned electric power industry had commenced construction. These nineteen projects include ten new and expanded thermal power plants in Shijiazhuang, Kaiyuan, Lanzhou, Huainan, Xia She Si, and others; two hydropower stations, namely the Shang You Jiang and Yi Li He; as well as five transmission lines and two substations. Among them, the newly expanded power generation equipment in seven power plants, including Lanzhou and Xia She Si, will begin generating electricity within this year, and most of the transmission and substation projects can also be completed within the year.
　　Some of these electric power infrastructure projects are key projects with comprehensive Soviet assistance for China's construction. The level of mechanization in the construction of these projects is higher than that of projects that started construction in previous years. In the Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant, which officially started construction on April 1, all tasks such as cutting steel bars, mixing and pouring concrete, and excavating earthwork are done using machinery. The construction site is crisscrossed with light railways, and mechanized woodworking and prefabrication plants have also been established. Just one mixer in the concrete mixing building can replace the physical labor of hundreds of people. The workers building this thermal power plant are striving to complete 80 percent of the main building's workload this year.

　　在社会主义的道路上前进
　　国营电力工业十九项较大的工程动工兴建
    我国国营电力工业到四月底已经有十九项较大的发电、送电和变电工程动工兴建。这十九项工程包括石家庄、开远、兰州、淮南、下摄司等十个新建的和扩建的火力发电厂，上犹江、以礼河等两个水力发电站，以及五条输电线路和两个变电所。其中兰州、下摄司等七个发电厂新扩建的发电设备，今年内都将开始发电，大部分送变电工程年内也可完工。
    这些电业基本建设，有一部分是苏联全面援助我国建设的重点工程。这些工程的施工机械化程度都比往年动工的工程高。在四月一日正式动工兴建的石家庄热电厂，施工中所有钢筋切断、混凝土搅拌和浇灌、土方挖掘等工作，全部使用机械。工地上密布着轻便铁道，还设立了机械化的木作加工厂和预制品加工厂。仅混凝土搅拌楼中的一架搅拌机，就能代替几百个人的体力劳动。建设这个热电厂的工人争取在今年年内完成这个厂主厂房工程的百分之八十的工作量。
    新建的上犹江和以礼河的水力发电站，是在苏联专家指导下由我国技术人员自己设计的，并将安装我国自己制造的中型水力发电设备。（新华社）
