　  To the Editor:

    At a time when modern transportation is still unable to keep up with the needs of national construction, fully organizing and utilizing animal-powered transportation is a very important task. For example, in Beijing, a single-horse rubber-wheeled cart can generally carry forty-eight bags of cement, totaling four thousand eight hundred catties, equivalent to a two-and-a-half-ton truck.

    However, some transportation departments and cart drivers are very poor in their care and management of livestock responsible for transportation work. On the streets, I personally witnessed cart drivers randomly beating livestock, especially when drivers themselves violated traffic rules and were criticized by the police, they would vent their anger by beating the animals. Once, I went to work in the Linxi mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine and found that the care for the mules pulling coal cars near the work surface was also very poor. Workers told me that before 1954, it was stipulated that the mules underground should be brought to the surface to bask in the sun every week or half a month, but now this has been changed. Once the livestock goes underground, it will never see the sun again unless it suffers a major injury (minor injuries can be treated underground). In addition, the places where the animals sleep are very damp, so the mules are constantly getting sick. It is said that this situation exists in all Kailuan mines.

    I hope that relevant departments will pay attention to the care of livestock and strengthen education for cart drivers on cherishing livestock.

### 教育马车工人爱护牲畜

　  教育马车工人爱护牲畜编辑同志：
    在近代化的交通运输工具还赶不上国家建设需要的时候，充分组织与利用畜力运输工具是一项很重要的工作。比如，在北京一辆单套胶轮车一般可装运四十八袋水泥，合四千八百斤，相当于一辆载重二吨半的卡车。
    但是，有些交通运输部门和马车工人对于负担运输工作的牲畜的护养管理却很差。在大街上，我亲眼看到马车工人乱打牲畜的事情，尤其赶车人自己违犯了交通规则后，民警批评了他们，他们就乱打牲畜出气。有一次，我去开滦煤矿林西矿井下工作，发现那里对那些靠近工作面拉煤车的骡子，护养也很差。工人告诉我：一九五四年以前规定井下的骡子每隔一周或半月上井晒一次太阳，现在则改了，牲畜下了井如果不受大伤（小伤井下可治）一辈子也不让它再见太阳，加以牲畜睡觉地方非常潮湿，因而，骡子不断闹病。据说，开滦各矿都有这种情形。
    希望有关部门重视牲畜的护养，加强对马车工人爱护牲畜的教育。华北工程管理总局　汪圻
