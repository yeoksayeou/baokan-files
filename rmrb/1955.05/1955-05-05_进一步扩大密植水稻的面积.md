　　Further Expand the Area of Closely Planted Rice

　　The results of trials, demonstrations, and promotion in various regions over the past few years have proven that appropriate close planting of rice based on the original sparse planting can significantly increase yields. According to a 1954 close planting rice experiment at the Dongyang County Farm in Zhejiang Province, rice planted with a row and hole spacing of six inches yielded an average of 694.4 jin per mu, an increase of 11.3 percent compared to seven inches, 20.4 percent compared to eight inches, and 25.5 percent compared to one foot. In 1954, 57 mutual aid teams in Shijiang Township, Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, led the masses in implementing uniform close planting. As a result, the average yield of more than 6,000 mu of mid-season rice exceeded 500 jin per mu, an increase of 10.5 percent compared to 1953. Similar situations exist in rice-producing areas such as Guangxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Sichuan.
    Due to the significant yield-increasing effect of close planting, the area of ​​closely planted rice in many regions has gradually expanded. In 1954, the area of ​​rice fields in Sichuan Province that implemented appropriate close planting accounted for 75 percent of the total rice field area; Zhejiang and Fujian provinces each reached 60 percent. According to preliminary statistics from eight provinces alone, the area of ​​rice fields that adjusted hole and row spacing based on the original has reached more than 100 million mu.
    One of the main shortcomings in promoting close planting of rice is that some cadres are satisfied with the existing achievements in promoting close planting of rice. Some people believe that the area of ​​closely planted rice is already large and there is no need to actively promote it further. This view is incorrect, because although the area of ​​closely planted rice has reached more than 100 million mu, it is still only a small part of the entire rice planting area; and the development is extremely unbalanced between regions. In most provinces and regions of the main rice-producing areas, the area of ​​close planting generally only reaches 10 to 30 percent. This situation shows that rice-producing areas should further expand the area of ​​closely planted rice on the original basis and cannot be satisfied with existing achievements.
    Another main shortcoming is the unreasonable planting density of closely planted rice. In 1954, only a small number of closely planted rice in Sichuan Province had a hole and row spacing of seven inches, only slightly more than half had a spacing of nine inches, and the rest were above nine inches. In addition, many areas of closely planted rice have uneven planting distances. For example, the "pair-pair rice" planting method adopted for late japonica rice in the Jiaxing area of ​​Zhejiang Province shortens the distance between two holes and plants them in pairs, while the distance between pairs is larger; although the closely planted rice in the Lixiahe area of ​​Jiangsu Province is planted relatively densely, most of them adopt "random planting" without a fixed distance; similar phenomena also exist in rice-growing areas in Northeast China that use transplanting. Because the distance between each hole of closely planted rice is uneven, the sunlight received, air ventilation, and fertilizer absorption are uneven, resulting in uneven growth and inconsistent maturity, which affects yield. In this year's promotion of close planting of rice, all rice-producing areas must correct these unreasonable practices. Experience has proven that keeping the number of holes per unit area unchanged, adjusting the hole and row spacing evenly, and adding an appropriate number of seedlings per hole can increase yield. In Xinbin, Huanren, Tieling and other places in Liaoning Province, the number of holes remained unchanged, and random planting was changed to uniform planting, with an average increase of more than 15 percent. In a 1953 experiment at the Xuancheng County Farm in Anhui Province, the yield was highest with six seedlings per hole when the hole and row spacing were both six inches.
    In 1954, many regions did not pay attention to timely transplanting and improved field management while promoting close planting of rice, which affected the performance of close planting. Some even caused yield reductions. This year, all rice-producing areas should prevent these shortcomings when promoting close planting.

　　进一步扩大密植水稻的面积
　　何珊庆
    几年来各地试验、示范和推广的结果证明：水稻在原来稀植的基础上适当密植，就能显著提高产量。据浙江省东阳县农场一九五四年密植水稻的试验，行、穴距六寸见方的，平均每亩产六九四点四斤，比七寸见方的增产百分之十一点三，比八寸见方的增产百分之二十点四，比一尺见方的增产百分之二十五点五。一九五四年湖南省湘乡县石江乡五十七个互助组带动全乡群众实行均匀密植，结果六千多亩中稻每亩平均产量在五百斤以上，比一九五三年增产百分之十点五。类似情况在广西、广东、浙江、江苏、四川等水稻产区都有。
    由于密植对水稻增产效果显著，许多地区密植水稻的面积已逐渐扩大。一九五四年四川省实行适当密植的稻田，已占稻田总面积的百分之七十五；浙江、福建两省各达百分之六十。仅据八个省的初步统计，在原来基础上，调整了穴、行距的稻田已达一亿亩以上。
    目前在推广水稻密植工作中的一个主要缺点是：有些干部满足于现有推广水稻密植的成绩。有人认为，水稻密植面积已经很大，可以不用再积极推广了。这种看法是不正确的，因为密植水稻面积虽然已经达到一亿多亩，但从整个水稻种植面积来看，还仅仅是一小部分；并且在地区之间发展极不平衡，在水稻主要产区的大部省区，密植面积一般只达百分之十到三十。这种情况说明，水稻产区都应该在原有基础上进一步扩大密植水稻的面积，不能满足已有的成绩。
    另一个主要缺点是密植水稻的插植密度不合理。一九五四年四川省密植的水稻，穴行距七寸见方的只是少数，九寸见方的只有半数多，其余的都是九寸以上。另外还有不少地区的密植水稻，插植的距离不均匀。如浙江省嘉兴地区晚粳稻的采用的
  “对对稻”插秧法，就是把两穴的距离缩得很短，插成一对，而对和对之间的距离则较大；江苏省里下河地区的密植水稻虽然插植较密，但大都采用没有一定距离的“乱插棵”，东北采用插秧种植的水稻区，也有类似的现象。因为密植水稻每穴秧苗的距离宽窄不匀，接受阳光、通透空气、吸收肥料就都不均匀，因此生长不齐，成熟不一，影响产量。各水稻区在今年推广水稻密植工作中，必须纠正这些不合理的作法。经验证明，单位面积的穴数不变，而把穴、行距调整均匀，再加每穴插秧株数适当，就可增产。辽宁省新宾、桓仁、铁岭等地，穴数不变，把乱插秧改成均匀插秧，平均增产百分之十五以上。安徽省宣城县农场一九五三年试验，穴、行距同为六寸见方的，以每穴六苗的产量为最高。
    一九五四年许多地区在推行水稻密植的同时，没有注意适期插秧和改进田间管理，因此影响密植效果的发挥，有的甚至造成减产，今年各水稻产区在推行密植中应该防止这些缺点。
