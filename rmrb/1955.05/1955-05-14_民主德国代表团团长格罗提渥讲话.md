Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 13th: Grotewohl, the head of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, spoke on the 11th at the Warsaw Conference of European countries on guaranteeing peace and security in Europe.

　　Grotewohl said that in West Germany, the American and German militarists have already forced the Bonn Federal Parliament to accept the Paris Accords. This is a new step towards deepening the division of Germany and making West Germany a military base, a springboard for American and German militarism. The development of the political situation in Germany and Europe after the Moscow Conference fully proves that the conference's assessment of the political situation and the conference's resolutions were correct. During this period, the necessity for the representatives of the eight countries participating in the Moscow Conference to take further steps aimed at guaranteeing peace and the security of all peoples, after consulting on the conclusion of a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance, has become even more obvious.

　　Grotewohl continued: The Paris Accords were ratified in violation of the will of the majority of the German people. The German Democratic Republic and all German patriots will never recognize the Paris Accords. They will mobilize the German people to fight against the Paris Accords and for a peaceful solution to the German question, until the Paris Accords are abolished and Germany becomes a unified, peaceful, and democratic country.

　　Grotewohl said that the example of Austria points out a specific path for resolving the German question. The success of the Soviet-Austrian negotiations was due to the Austrian government taking the road of adopting an independent national policy. Whether the German question can be resolved now depends mainly on whether the patriotic forces in West Germany can pursue a truly independent national policy, a policy of peacefully reunifying Germany in accordance with democratic principles, and a policy of peaceful negotiation and seeking agreement.

　　Grotewohl said that the European situation arising after the ratification of the Paris Accords requires all peace-loving countries to unite their forces to ensure their security. Therefore, the German Democratic Republic agrees to sign a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance, and to establish a joint command. These measures provide a new form of cooperation between equal and sovereign countries, the purpose of which is to guarantee peace and organize the defense of their countries. These measures are an important step towards establishing a comprehensive European collective security system and are fully in line with the national interests of the German Democratic Republic and the entire German people. The German Democratic Republic will do its utmost to contribute to the defense forces of the eight countries participating in this conference and to prevent West German militarism from re-engaging in aggression.

　　Grotewohl emphasized that the Paris Accords are fraught with the danger of West German and American war instigators launching aggression from German territory. The Warsaw Treaty will contain the aggressors and prevent them from engaging in any kind of adventure. The purpose of the Paris Accords is to prepare for a new war. The Warsaw Treaty serves the cause of security and peace. The Paris Accords mean the division of Germany. The Warsaw Treaty strengthens the patriotic forces in Germany, enabling them to successfully advance along the road of peacefully reunifying their motherland. The Paris Accords deprive the residents of West Germany of the right to reach an agreement on reunifying Germany in accordance with peaceful and democratic principles. The Warsaw Treaty, on the other hand, gives the German Democratic Republic full freedom to negotiate the peaceful reunification of Germany. To reunify Germany in accordance with peaceful and democratic principles is the inalienable national right of the German people. The German Democratic Republic will do its utmost to uphold and implement this right.

　　民主德国代表团团长格罗提渥讲话
    新华社华沙十三日电　德意志民主共和国代表团团长格罗提渥，十一日在欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全的华沙会议上讲了话。
    格罗提渥说，在西德，美国和德国军国主义者已经迫使波恩联邦议院接受了巴黎协定。这是加深德国的分裂和使西德成为军事基地、成为美国和德国军国主义的跳板的一个新步骤。莫斯科会议以后德国和欧洲的政治局势的发展，完全证明了会议对政治局势的估计和会议的决议是正确的。在这期间，参加莫斯科会议的八国代表在就缔结一项友好、合作和互助条约的问题进行商谈以后，采取目的在于保障和平和各国人民的安全的进一步的步骤的必要性变得更加明显了。
    格罗提渥接着说：巴黎协定是在违反大多数德国人民的意志的情况下批准的，德意志民主共和国以及所有德国的爱国者决不承认巴黎协定。他们将动员德国人民群众进行反对巴黎协定和争取和平解决德国问题的斗争，直到巴黎协定被废除，德国成为统一、和平和民主的国家的时候为止。
    格罗提渥说，奥地利的榜样指明了解决德国问题的具体道路。由于奥地利政府走采取独立的民族政策的道路，因而使苏奥谈判得到了成功。德国问题能否得到解决，现在主要取决于西德的爱国力量能否推行一种真正独立的民族政策，推行一种按照民主方针使德国和平地重新统一的政策，以及和平地进行谈判和谋求协议的政策。
    格罗提渥说，巴黎协定批准后所产生的欧洲局势，要求一切爱好和平的国家联合他们的力量来保证他们的安全。因此，德意志民主共和国同意签订一个友好、合作和互助条约，并设立一个联合司令部。这些措施提供了平等自主的国家之间的合作的新形式，它的目的是要保障和平和组织他们国家的防御。这些措施是走向建立一个全面的欧洲集体安全体系的重要步骤，是完全符合德意志民主共和国和全体德国人民的民族利益的。德意志民主共和国将尽它最大的力量，以求对参加本会议的八个国家的防御力量有所贡献，并且防止西德军国主义重新进行侵略。
    格罗提渥强调说，巴黎协定充满了西德和美国战争煽动者从德国领土发动侵略的危险。华沙条约将遏制侵略者并防止它们从事某种冒险。巴黎协定的目的是准备一场新的战争。华沙条约是为安全和和平事业服务的。巴黎协定意味着德国的分裂。华沙条约增强着德国的爱国力量，使它们可以顺利地沿着和平地重新统一它们祖国的道路前进。巴黎协定剥夺了西德居民按照和平和民主方针达成重新统一德国的协议的权利。华沙条约则让德意志民主共和国有充分的自由来谈判和平地重新统一德国的问题。按照和平和民主的方针来重新统一德国乃是德国人民的不可分割的民族权利。德意志民主共和国将竭尽它的最大的力量来维护和实施这种权利。
