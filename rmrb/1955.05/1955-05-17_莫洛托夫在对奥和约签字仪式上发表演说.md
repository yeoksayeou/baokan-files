Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, May 15th. TASS dispatch: Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, delivered a speech on May 15 at the signing ceremony of the Austrian State Treaty.

	Molotov first pointed out that the signing of the Austrian State Treaty is an important international event. The signed treaty restores the sovereignty and independence of a democratic Austria. This treaty opens a new page in the history of the Austrian people and in the history of relations between European countries.

	Molotov said that Austria has declared that it will maintain permanent neutrality. From now on, in addition to Switzerland, there will be another neutral Austria in the heart of Europe. The governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have stated that they are prepared to respect Austria's neutrality. Molotov expressed his belief that other countries will follow suit.

	Molotov said: The Soviet Union attaches great importance to Austria's statement that it will not join any military alliances and will not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory. The Soviet people warmly welcome Austria's upright neutral stance, which is of great significance to the consolidation of peace in Europe. This position is in line with the sincere aspirations of the Austrian people and will receive satisfactory support from the peoples of Europe and other countries.

	After briefly recounting the process of concluding the Austrian State Treaty, Molotov said that the Soviet government had not only worked to prevent delays in resolving the Austrian issue, but also to prevent delays in resolving the German issue. However, under the current circumstances, this has proven impossible. He pointed out that no progress can yet be said to have been made in resolving the German question. New obstacles have arisen, greatly complicating the situation. The threat of a revival of aggressive German militarism has arisen, forcing peace-loving European countries to take new measures to safeguard their security.

	Molotov said: The Soviet Union will continue to strive to find ways to achieve a peaceful and democratic solution to the German question, and will continue to seek solutions that conform to the legitimate aspirations of the German people to restore German unity without reviving German militarism. Only in this way will the solution of the German question fully conform to the interests of restoring Germany's freedom and independence, making it a complete country, and to the interests of truly strengthening peace in Europe.

	Molotov said: It must be recognized that every step taken to ease international tensions is in line with the greatest aspirations of the people of all countries. The conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty will ease international tensions, and its special significance lies in this.

	Molotov then spoke of the ongoing negotiations between the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union regarding the upcoming summit of heads of government, noting that all four governments have expressed their positive attitudes. The purpose of this meeting is to encourage the adoption of steps and concrete measures that conform to the desire of the people of all countries to ease international tensions, which is fully in line with the Soviet government's peace policy. The new steps constantly taken by the Soviet Union clearly demonstrate this. Among these new steps, special mention should be made of the Soviet Union's recent proposal including a concrete plan for universal disarmament, the banning of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the establishment of international supervision. This plan is in line with the interests of strengthening universal peace.

	Molotov particularly pointed out that the smooth completion of the preparatory work for the signing of the Austrian State Treaty once again demonstrates the possibility of resolving pressing international issues.

	Molotov concluded by expressing the hope to strengthen friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Austria, noting that this is beneficial to the peoples of both countries and to the consolidation of world peace.

    莫洛托夫在对奥和约签字仪式上发表演说
    新华社十六日讯　据塔斯社维也纳十五日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席兼苏联外交部长莫洛托夫十五日在对奥和约的签字仪式上发表了演说。
    莫洛托夫首先指出，对奥和约的签字是一个重要的国际事件，签署的条约恢复了一个民主的奥地利的主权和独立。这个条约在奥地利人民的历史上以及欧洲国家之间关系的历史上展开了新的一页。
    莫洛托夫说，奥地利宣布，它将保持永久的中立。从今以后，除了瑞士之外，在欧洲的中心将还有一个中立的奥地利。苏联、美国、英国和法国的政府已经表示它们准备尊重奥地利的中立。莫洛托夫表示相信，其他的国家也将跟着这样做。
    莫洛托夫说：苏联非常重视奥地利的关于它将不参加任何军事联盟并且将不允许在它的领土上建立外国军事基地的声明。苏联人民热烈地欢迎奥地利的这种正直的中立立场，这种立场对欧洲和平的巩固有着重大的意义。这种立场符合于奥地利人民的真诚愿望，并将得到欧洲的和其他国家人民满意的支持。
    莫洛托夫在简单地追述了缔结对奥和约的经过之后说，苏联政府不仅曾经努力防止拖延解决奥地利问题，而且也曾努力防止拖延解决德国问题。但是，在目前的情况下，这一点证明是做不到。他指出，在解决德国问题方面还不能说已经有了任何进展。新的障碍已经产生，从而使情况大大复杂化了。侵略性的德国军国主义复活的威胁产生了，这就使爱好和平的欧洲国家不得不采取新的措施来保障它们的安全。
    莫洛托夫说：苏联将继续为寻求使德国问题得到和平、民主的解决的方法而努力，将继续寻求符合于德国人民要求恢复德国统一而不要复活德国军国主义的正当愿望的解决德国问题的方法。只有这样解决德国问题，才能完全符合于恢复德国的自由和独立、使它成为一个完整的国家的利益，并符合于真正加强欧洲和平的利益。
    莫洛托夫说：必须承认，目前缓和国际紧张局势的每一个步骤都是符合于各国人民的最大愿望的。对奥和约的缔结将缓和国际紧张局势，它的特别意义就在于此。
    莫洛托夫接着谈到美国、英国、法国和苏联之间目前正在进行的关于即将举行的政府首脑会议的谈判，他指出，所有这四国政府都表示了它们的积极态度。这种会议的目的在于鼓励采取符合于各国人民要求缓和国际紧张局势的愿望的步骤和具体措施，这完全符合于苏联政府的和平政策。苏联不断采取的新步骤便清楚地证明了这一点。在这些新步骤中应该特别提到苏联最近所提出的包括一项关于普遍裁减军备、禁止原子武器和氢武器和建立国际监督的具体计划的建议。这项计划是符合于加强普遍和平的利益的。
    莫洛托夫特别指出，关于对奥和约签字问题的准备工作的顺利完成再一次表明，存在着解决迫切的国际问题的可能性。
    莫洛托夫最后表示希望加强苏联同奥地利之间的友好关系，他指出，这是对两国人民和对巩固世界和平有利的。
