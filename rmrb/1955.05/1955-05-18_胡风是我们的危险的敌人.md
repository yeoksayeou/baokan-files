　　Hu Feng is Our Dangerous Enemy
　　Cang Su
　　I am a film worker. After reading "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique," I couldn't help but be shocked and incredibly angry. Shocked that Hu Feng and his small clique have consistently opposed the Party for more than ten years, reaching such a despicable, shameless, and unscrupulous level of seriousness, practically the same as the Kuomintang reactionaries' hired writers at the time. Angry that, even today, Hu Feng still dares to deceive the Party and the masses in broad daylight with false self-criticisms, trying to put flattering words on himself as much as possible, without showing the slightest genuine sign of repentance.

　　From the materials revealed by Shu Wu, it is already clear that for more than ten years, Hu Feng has consistently and tirelessly launched frantic attacks on the literary and art front led by the Party, and viciously attacked and shamelessly slandered the revolutionary writers inside and outside the Party. He pretended to be progressive on the surface, mixing in the revolutionary literary ranks led by the Party; in reality, he was extremely hostile to this team. He cursed the people united in this team as "maggots," saying that he had no choice but to "mingle" among them. He clearly stated that he "cannot compromise" with the Party (that is, what he called the "officialdom"), and declared that he would be a "great brave man" fighting against the Party. To this end, he did not hesitate to adopt all kinds of despicable means, repeatedly encouraging the members of his small clique to "charge" and "coexist and die with the position," teaching them how to "use a whip wrapped with rubber around steel wire to beat prisoners, causing injuries that are not visible on the surface," to attack the Party and the revolutionary literary and art circles! He even attempted to establish "coordinated small strongholds" in the supplements of reactionary newspapers to attack the progressive literary team led by the Party... All these materials show that Hu Feng has always been irreconcilable with the revolutionary literary circles led by the Party.

　　But listen to the pleasant tune that Hu Feng sings in his "self-criticism." He has a "stand of sharing the fate with the people" and a "revolutionary humanitarian spirit," and his literary activities "can conform to the Party's political program to a certain extent during that period." These tunes, compared with the words in those secret letters he wrote himself, aren't they clearly two-faced and disguised as progressive? As the saying goes, "If you don't want people to know, don't do it." Since Hu Feng has done dirty things, he cannot cover them up with eloquent words. The only way out is to openly reveal all the details of his anti-Party activities without concealment and start a new life honestly from now on. Attempting to change strategies and muddle through will not work.

　　Hu Feng's extremely rampant, die-hard individualistic bourgeois idealist ideology is very harmful to our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation. Ideologically speaking, Hu Feng is our dangerous enemy. As for the enemy, when he has not finally laid down his weapons, we cannot live in peace with him for a moment.

　  胡风是我们的危险的敌人
    仓粟
    我是电影工作人员，读了“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”之后，不禁使人大吃一惊和无比愤怒。吃惊的是：胡风和他的小集团十多年来一贯反党，竟达到如此卑鄙、无耻、不择手段的严重地步，和当时国民党反动派的御用文人，简直是一丘之貉。愤怒的是：直到今天，胡风仍胆敢在光天化日之下，用假检讨来欺骗党和群众，尽量把一些好听的字眼往自己头上安，没有表示出丝毫真正悔改之意。
    从舒芜所揭露的这一部分材料中，已经可以明白地看出，十多年来，胡风一贯地、不遗余力地向党所领导的文艺战线进行猖狂进攻，对党同党外的革命作家进行恶毒的攻击和无耻的诽谤。他表面上假装进步，混在党所领导的革命文学队伍中；实际上，对这个队伍却万分仇视。把团结在这个队伍中的人们骂作“蛆虫”，说他自己是不得已而“混在”里面。他明白表示，对党（也就是他所说的“官方”）“妥协不来”，宣称要作一个对党作战的
  “大勇者”。为此，他不惜采取一切卑劣手段，一再鼓动他的小集团的成员们“冲锋”、“与阵地共存亡”，教给他们“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”的方法，来向党和革命文艺界进攻！甚至还企图在反动报纸的副刊上，建立攻击党所领导的进步文学队伍的“配合的小据点。”………所有这些材料，都说明了胡风一直是同党所领导的革命文学界不共戴天的。
    但是，听一听胡风在他的“检讨”中高唱的好听的曲调吧，他是有“和人民共命运的立场”和
  “革命的人道主义精神”的，他的文学活动是“能够在一定程度上符合党在那个时期的政治纲领”的。这些曲调和上面他自己亲手所写的那些密信中的话对照起来，这不是明明白白的阴阳两面，伪装进步吗？常言道：“要想人不知，除非己莫为”。胡风既已作下了肮脏事，靠花言巧语是掩盖不了的。唯一的出路是：把全部反党活动情况毫无隐瞒地公开出来，自己从此老老实实的重新作人。企图转变战略，敷衍过去，是行不通的。
    胡风的极端猖狂死硬的个人主义的资产阶级唯心论思想，对于我们国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业是十分有害的，在思想上来说，胡风是我们的危险的敌人。而对于敌人，当他还没有最后放下武器的时候，我们是一时一刻也不能同他和平相处的。
