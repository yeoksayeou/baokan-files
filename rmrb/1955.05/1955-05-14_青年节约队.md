　　On the square of the Shanghai Shipyard, a large red flag embroidered with the words "Youth Conservation Team" flutters in the wind. On the square, the clang of metal striking metal resounds. Many young people have glistening beads of sweat on their faces, some are carrying pieces of rusty scrap iron, and some are bending over and working hard to dig out large iron plates that have been trampled into the mud and are level with the ground. This is the Youth Conservation Team of the hull workshop. Every Friday, they use their lunch break to collect waste and old materials.
　　The whistle for work sounds. One by one, young conservation team members with "Conservation Tubes" hanging on their bodies emerge from the ships, from the reed sheds, and from every corner, in unison with the brisk musical melody from the loudspeaker. With a rustling sound, they each pour the collected scrap copper and iron into large barrels, and then happily head to their respective production posts.
　　This youth conservation team was first organized by more than twenty young people from the caulking section of the hull workshop in October 1954 in response to the Party's call for increasing production and practicing economy. Several times in a row, each time using twenty minutes of their spare time, they collected more than two thousand kilograms of scrap rivets, screws, angle iron, and so on. Their pioneering behavior greatly inspired and encouraged the youth of the entire factory. Soon, under the leadership of the factory's Communist Youth League committee, sixteen youth conservation teams were successively organized, with more than six hundred members. Over the past six months, they have carried out more than sixty amateur public welfare activities throughout the factory, recovering more than 51,300 kilograms of steel plates, scrap iron, copper, rivets, screws and other hardware materials, as well as a lot of timber. They have also put forward four conservation suggestions with great value, such as rivet storage method and quick rivet cutting method. Now, they have also established a regular system, carrying out a scrap and old material collection activity every week.
　　Recently, the young workers of the entire factory wrote a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Shanghai First Heavy Industry Committee of the Communist Youth League, suggesting that the young workers of the entire city take action together to carry out the activity of collecting scrap and old materials, so that these things can be turned into useful materials for manufacturing machines, tractors, automobiles, and ships, to build our great motherland.

　　青年节约队
　　何瑶生
    在上海船舶修造厂的广场上，有一面绣着“青年节约队”字样的大红旗在迎风飘舞。广场上，铿铿锵锵的金属撞击声响成一片。许多年轻人的脸上都冒着晶莹的汗珠，有的在扛抬着一块块生满了锈的废铁，有的弯着腰用劲地在挖掘着陷在泥里已经被践踏得和地面一样平了的大铁板。这就是船体车间的青年节约队，他们每逢星期五，利用中午休息时间进行收集废料旧料的活动。
    上班的汽笛响了。一个个身上挂着“节约筒”的青年节约队员们，随着播音器里轻快的音乐旋律，不约而同地从船上，从芦席棚中，从各个角落里走了出来。哗啦啦一阵响声，他们各人把收集来的废铜废铁倒入大桶后，便愉快地各自走向自己的生产岗位去了。
    这个青年节约队伍，是由船体车间拆铆工段二十多个青年在一九五四年十月间响应党的增产节约号召首先组织起来的。他们接连几次，每次用二十几分钟的业余时间，收集二千多公斤的废铆钉、螺丝、角铁等。他们的首创行为，使全厂青年受到了很大的启发和鼓舞。不久，在厂团委的领导下，先后组织了十六支青年节约队，拥有六百多个队员。半年多来，他们在全厂范围内共进行了六十多次业余公益劳动，收回钢板、碎铁、铜、铆钉、螺丝等五金材料五万一千三百多公斤和很多木材，并且还提出了铆钉保管法、快速割铆法等四项有巨大价值的节约建议。现在，他们并建立了经常的制度，每个星期都要进行一次收集废料旧料的节约活动。
    全厂青年工人最近写了一封信给青年团上海市委和青年团上海第一重工业委员会，建议全市青年工人一起行动起来，开展收集废料旧料的活动，使这些东西都能变成制造机器、拖拉机、汽车和轮船的有用材料，来建设伟大的祖国。
