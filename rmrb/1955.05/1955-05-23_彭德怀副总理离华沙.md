The results of this Warsaw Conference have laid a solid foundation for the collective security system in Europe and will greatly advance the cause of world peace. During our visit to Poland, I had the honor of meeting Comrade Beirut, the beloved leader of the Polish people, and other leading comrades of Poland, as well as generals, officers, and soldiers of the Polish army. We had friendly conversations with them and conducted tours and visits in various parts of Poland. We saw the beautiful capital Warsaw, rebuilt by the Polish people through selfless labor, and the beloved steel capital, the Lenin Metallurgical Combine, built by the Polish people with their hardworking hands. All of this has given us a deep impression of the great achievements of the Polish people over the past decade. In particular, we have seen that the Polish People's Army, with its glorious history of struggle, has reached a high level in terms of equipment, combat training, and political quality through long-term construction, becoming an important force in defending European peace. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is very happy to be your loyal friend. Although our two countries are geographically far apart, the common belief in defending world peace and building socialism unites us together. We also regard all your achievements as our own and feel very excited and happy. Let us express our heartfelt congratulations to the Polish people and the Polish People's Army for their significant achievements. Let us wish the Polish people and the Polish People's Army greater and more brilliant achievements in the cause of building the motherland, defending the motherland, and safeguarding world peace.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Polish people and armies!

Long live the growing strength of the world's peace and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union!
