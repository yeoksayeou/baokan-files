Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th. A report from the Vietnam News Agency on the 6th: Kaysone, representative of the General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Units, in answering questions posed by a Vietnam News Agency reporter, explained the Lao side’s attitude at the Lao political conference.

In answering the question of why the Lao political conference had reached a deadlock, Kaysone said: The reason for the deadlock is that the proposals made by the political delegation of the Lao Royal Government and the delegation of the Lao Fighting Units regarding the functions and tasks of the Political Consultative Committee are very different. The Royal Government delegation proposed: The Political Consultative Committee will only discuss the issue of isolating the armed forces of both sides within the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly, and the issue of establishing Royal administrative institutions within these two provinces. The Lao delegation proposed: The Political Consultative Committee should resolve all disputes, including those in the above-mentioned two provinces, throughout the country, with the primary focus on resolving the issue of the people's democratic freedoms, and holding free general elections in accordance with the Constitution in order to establish a national assembly and a coalition government for the entire country in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. The above two proposals have fundamentally different viewpoints on national unity and the implementation of the Geneva Accords.

In answering the question about the Lao side's view on national unity, Kaysone pointed out: The Royal Government delegation believes that national unity is the resolution of the administrative and military issues in the provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua, which is to completely violate the Geneva Accords and incorporate Laos into the Lao Royal Government. Contrary to the Royal Government delegation's viewpoint, the Lao side's view on national unity is that the Lao Fighting Units resolutely fought against imperialist aggressors for eight or nine years in order to defend peace and national independence. Before the conclusion of the Geneva Accords, the Lao forces had already liberated nearly half of the entire territory and population of Laos. At the Geneva Conference, the French-Lao side had already recognized this fact. Therefore, it negotiated and reached an agreement with the representative of the General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Units on an equal footing, so that all citizens could participate in the common life of the country, rather than having the Lao forces incorporated into the Royal army.

National unity here means that all citizens participate in the common life of the country. Every Lao citizen, regardless of political affiliation, religion, or ethnicity, whether he is a member of the Royal Government or a cadre or soldier of Laos, should participate in this common life.

Kaysone said: In order to realize the participation of all citizens in the common life of the country, free general elections should be held through secret ballot in accordance with the Geneva Accords, in order to elect a national assembly and a coalition government, which will become the highest organs representing the will and aspirations of the entire people.

Kaysone also said: In order to ensure a consolidated and lasting national unity, democratic freedoms should be realized, and the interests of the people should be guaranteed, thereby mobilizing the people's inexhaustible strength for national construction.

In answering the question of whether Laos' proposals are as unconstitutional as the Royal side claims, Kaysone pointed out: Not at all! In accordance with the situation of Laos, which has already gained independence, in the spirit of national unity, and in order to correctly implement the Geneva Agreements, the Lao side has put forward several proposals on the issue of general elections in order to prevent the violation of the Geneva Agreements, the exclusion of former resistance personnel, and the restriction of people's freedom of speech. This proposal is put forward for discussion and to seek a solution on the basis of mutual reconciliation, not for the purpose of making unilateral decisions. Kaysone said: Therefore, we believe that it is necessary for the political delegation of the Lao Royal Government to discuss this proposal with our delegation at the political conference, in order to quickly reach a solution for national unity that conforms to the wishes of the entire Lao people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th. According to a report from the Lao "Liberation News": Kaysone, representative of the General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Units, recently replied to a suggestion made on April 20th by the Indian and Canadian delegations of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos to the General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Units. This suggestion requested the delineation of the garrison areas for the Lao Royal Army in the Lao Fighting Units' assembly areas, Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces, as stipulated in Article 14 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos. This suggestion was also sent to the signatories of the Geneva Conference – the General Headquarters of the French Federation Forces and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

In his reply, Kaysone pointed out that the Lao Fighting Units do not recognize the existence of the Kingdom's army in Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces. The reply stated that before the ceasefire on August 6, 1954, the Lao Fighting Units had already completely liberated Sam Neua province and Phong Saly province, and had also liberated a vast area accounting for half of the total area of Laos. However, for the benefit of the country and for peace, the Lao Fighting Units followed the provisions of the Geneva Accords and withdrew all their armed forces throughout the country on time, assembling in Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces. The reply said that the Lao Fighting Units had submitted a protest to the International Commission in April, presenting conclusive evidence that the Royal side had sent troops and gathered bandits to invade Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces after the ceasefire.

The reply pointed out that the armed forces commanded by the Royal government have seriously violated the Geneva Accords and must withdraw completely from Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces. Articles 14 and 19 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos can only be understood and interpreted in such a way that the Royal side should respect the two assembly provinces of the Lao Fighting Units, just as the Lao Fighting Units have respected the ten provinces controlled by the Royal government since the ceasefire.

The reply said that in the event that the armed forces commanded by the Royal government do not have sufficient conditions and time to withdraw completely from the two provinces, these armed forces may temporarily concentrate in several locations in these two provinces. However, the parties concerned must equally express good faith and a spirit of mutual concession, and should not only require the Lao Fighting Units to make concessions.

The reply said: The military and administrative issues of Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces, like the fundamental national political issues related to both sides, are internal issues that are directly discussed and resolved by the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Units, with the assistance of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in providing opinions. This is entirely in accordance with the spirit of the joint statement issued by Royal Government Prime Minister Katay and Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong in Bandung on April 23.

The reply finally expressed the hope that all parties concerned would conduct consultations in a spirit of good faith, equality and mutual respect, so that the implementation of the Geneva Accords would achieve satisfactory results.

　　关于寮国方面在老挝政治会议上的态度
　　寮国战斗部队总部代表凯山答记者问
    新华社河内六日电　据越南通讯社六日讯：寮国战斗部队总司令部代表凯山在回答越南通讯社记者提出的问题时，说明了寮国方面在老挝政治会议上的态度。
    凯山在回答关于老挝政治会议为什么发生僵局的问题时说：发生僵局的原因是老挝王国政府政治代表团和寮国战斗部队代表团所提出的关于政治协商委员会的职权和任务的建议彼此有很大的不同。王国政府代表团建议：政治协商委员会将只讨论隔离双方在桑怒和丰沙里两省内的武装部队的问题，以及解决在这两省内建立王国行政机构的问题。寮国代表团建议：政治协商委员会应当解决包括上述两省在内的全国各地所有的纠纷，首要的是解决人民的民主自由问题，根据宪法举行自由普选以便依照日内瓦协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言的规定为全国建立一个国民议会和一个联合政府。上述两个建议对于国家统一和履行日内瓦协定的观点是基本上不同的。
    凯山在回答关于寮国方面对国家统一的观点的问题时指出：王国政府代表团认为，国家的统一是解决丰沙里和桑怒两省的行政和军事问题，这就是要完全违反日内瓦协定而把寮国并到老挝王国政府中去。和王国政府代表团的观点相反，寮国方面对国家统一的观点是，寮国战斗部队曾为了保卫和平和国家独立而坚决地对帝国主义侵略者进行了八、九年的斗争。在日内瓦协定缔结以前，寮国部队已经解放了老挝全部领土和居民的将近一半。在日内瓦会议上，法国—老挝方面已经承认这个事实。因此，它同寮国战斗部队总司令部代表在平等的基础上进行了谈判和达成协议，以使全体公民参加全国共同生活而不是使寮国部队并入王国军队。
    国家统一在这里意味着全体公民参加全国共同生活。每个老挝公民，不分政治关系、宗教或民族，不论他是王国政府的人员还是寮国的干部或战士，都应当参加这个共同生活。
    凯山说：为了实现使全体公民参加全国共同生活，应当按照日内瓦协定通过秘密投票方式举行自由普选，以便选出一个国民议会和一个联合政府，成为代表全体人民意志和愿望的最高机关。
    凯山并且说：为了保证巩固而持久的国家统一，民主自由应当实现，人民的利益应当得到保障，从而动员人民无穷尽的力量进行国家建设。
    在回答关于寮国的建议是否像王国方面所说的那样不符合宪法的问题时，凯山指出：一点也不！按照已经获得独立的老挝的情况，本着国家统一的精神，并且为了正确地履行日内瓦协议，寮国方面已经就普选问题提出了若干建议，以便防止违反日内瓦协定而排斥前抗战人员和限制人民发表意见。这项建议是提出来供讨论并且在相互和解精神的基础上谋求解决，而不是为了作出片面决定的。凯山说：因此，我们认为老挝王国政府政治代表团有必要在政治会议上和我们的代表团讨论这项建议，以便迅速地得出符合全体老挝人民愿望的国家统一的解决办法。
    新华社河内七日电据寮国“解放报”消息：寮国战斗部队总司令部代表凯山最近答复了老挝国际监督和监察委员会的印度和加拿大两国代表团四月二十日给寮国战斗部队总司令部的一项建议，这项建议要求划定老挝王国军队在老挝停止敌对行动协定第十四条所规定的寮国战斗部队集结地区——丰沙里和桑怒两省内的驻军地区。这项建议同时送给日内瓦会议的签字的双方——法兰西联邦部队总司令部和越南民主共和国政府。
    凯山在复信中指出，寮国战斗部队不承认在桑怒和丰沙里两省有王国的军队。复信说，在一九五四年八月六日停火前，寮国战斗部队早已完全解放了桑怒省和丰沙里省，而且还解放了老挝全国面积的一半的广大地区。但是，为了国家的利益，为了和平，寮国战斗部队遵照日内瓦协定的规定按时撤出了全国范围内的全部武装力量。集结到桑怒和丰沙里两省去。复信说，寮国战斗部队曾在四月间把一份抗议书递交国际委员会。提出确凿证据，证明王国方面曾经在停火以后派遣军队和纠集土匪侵犯桑怒和丰沙里两省。
    复信指出，由王国指挥的武装队伍严重地违反了日内瓦协定，他们必须全部撤离桑怒和丰沙里两省。对于老挝停止敌对行动协定第十四条和十九条只能作这样的了解和解释，即王国方面应尊重寮国战斗部队的两个集结省份，正如停火以来寮国战斗部队一直尊重由王国所控制的十个省份一样。
    复信说，在由王国政府指挥的武装力量没有足够条件和时间从两省全部撤出的情况下，这些武装力量可以暂时集中到这两省里的若干地点。但有关双方必须同样地表示善意和互让的精神，不应只要寮国战斗部队一方让步。
    复信说：桑怒和丰沙里两省的军事和行政问题如同双方有关的全国性的基本政治问题一样，都是内部问题，由老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队直接商量解决，并由国际监督和监察委员会协助提出意见。这是完全符合王国政府首相克特和越南民主共和国副总理兼外交部长范文同四月二十三日在万隆所发表的联合声明的精神。
    复信最后希望有关双方都以善意、平等和互相尊重的精神来进行商量，使执行日内瓦协定获得圆满结果。
