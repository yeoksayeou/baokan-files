　　Emphasize the Work of Cultivating Seedlings
　　Tu Guanghan
    This spring, some areas have been affected in the normal progress of afforestation work due to insufficient seedlings. In Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, the masses have a high enthusiasm for afforestation, but due to insufficient seedlings, 7,000 mu of afforestation land has not been afforested. Fujian Province estimates that it is also short of 62.72 million seedlings of fir, pine, eucalyptus, etc. Similar situations exist in Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces.
    The main reason for the problem of insufficient seedlings is that the leading organs and forestry departments in some areas do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of seedling cultivation. The production of many state-owned nurseries is uncontrolled and cannot fully complete the production plan. The seedling cultivation work of the masses cannot be well developed due to lack of leadership. Seedlings are the material basis for afforestation. Generally speaking, afforestation cannot be carried out without seedlings. The fact that many areas could not complete their afforestation tasks this spring due to insufficient seedlings is a good example.
    Some workers in some areas have expanded the afforestation area by using methods such as digging wild seedlings or using seeds for sowing, cuttings, and burying stems, and have partially overcome the difficulty of insufficient seedlings. Therefore, they believe that afforestation can be carried out without cultivating seedlings. This understanding is incorrect. Using methods such as digging wild seedlings for afforestation can partially overcome the difficulty of lacking seedlings, but it must be recognized that the quality of wild seedlings is poor, the survival rate of afforestation is low, the number of seedlings is also limited, and the cost of afforestation is high; long-term continuous use of cuttings and burying stems for afforestation will cause the degradation of trees; afforestation using direct sowing is currently limited by environment, tree species, and technology, and cannot be universally adopted.
    Although this year's spring afforestation work has basically ended, afforestation is a regular task. Many areas will carry out afforestation during the rainy season and autumn this year, and some areas can also carry out afforestation in winter. Moreover, afforestation will be carried out every year in the future. Therefore, in order to do a good job in future afforestation, all localities should remember the lessons learned this year from the impact of the lack of seedlings on the completion of afforestation tasks and earnestly emphasize the work of cultivating seedlings.

### 重视培育苗木的工作

　　重视培育苗木的工作
　　涂光涵
    今年春季有些地区由于苗木不足，影响了造林工作的正常开展。湖南省湘乡县的群众造林情绪很高，但是由于苗木不足，有七千亩造林地没有造林。福建省估计今年也缺少杉、松、桉等苗木六千二百七十二万株。黑龙江、辽宁等省也有类似的情况。
    产生苗木不足问题的主要原因，是某些地区领导机关和林业部门的工作人员对育苗工作的重要性认识不足。许多国营苗圃的生产自流，不能全面完成生产计划。群众的育苗工作，由于缺乏领导，也不能得到很好发展。苗木是进行造林的物质基础，就多数情况说，没有苗木就不能造林。今年春季许多地区因苗木不足而不能完成造林任务就是很好的例证。
    有些地区的工作人员，由于采用挖野生苗或用种子播种、插条、埋干等办法扩大了造林面积，部分地克服了苗木不足的困难，因而就认为不育苗也能造林。这种认识是不对的，采用挖野生苗等办法造林可以部分地克服缺乏苗木的困难，但是必须认识到，野生苗的质量差，造林成活率低，苗木的数量也有限，造林的成本高；长期连续采用插条、埋干方法造林，会引起林木的退化；用直接播种的方法造林，目前还受环境、树种和技术等的限制，不能普遍采用。
    今年的春季造林工作虽已基本结束，但是造林是一件经常性的工作，今年的雨季、秋季许多地区还要造林，有些地区冬季也可以造林，而且以后每年都要造林。因此，为了做好今后的造林工作，各地应该记取今年因缺乏苗木而影响造林任务完成的教训，切实重视培育苗木工作。
