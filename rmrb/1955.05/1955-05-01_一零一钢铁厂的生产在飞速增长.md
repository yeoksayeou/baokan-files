　　The Rapid Growth of Production at Steel Plant 101
　　Zhang Rubin, Deputy Chief Engineer of Southwest Iron and Steel Company
　　Steel Plant 101, belonging to the Southwest Iron and Steel Company, moved from Shanghai to Wuhan in the year the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and then from Wuhan to Chongqing. It was built by merging the equipment of several factories, including power, steelmaking, ironmaking, steel rail, refractory materials, machine repair, riveting and welding, and casting equipment. These tens of thousands of tons of machinery and equipment were all rescued by the workers at the risk of being bombed by enemy aircraft.

　　After the factory was built in Chongqing, the Kuomintang reactionary government did not care about production and only wanted to rely on foreign imports. Except for using a small amount of equipment to manufacture munitions to launch a civil war, most of the machinery and equipment were often idle. Even if a little product was produced, no one cared about it. The tall chimneys could not be seen smoking. Secret agents in the factory were rampant and oppressed the workers. At that time, as an engineer, I felt depressed and distressed about my future, and I felt extremely angry when I thought about it.

　　On the eve of the liberation of Chongqing, the factory suffered serious damage from Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. The generator in the factory was bombed, and the iron-smelting blast furnace was also damaged, plunging the entire factory into a dark and terrifying world. However, the Communist Party members and many workers immediately risked their lives to transport explosives and rescue the factory after the enemy retreated. Seventeen people gloriously sacrificed themselves while transporting explosives.

　　November 30, 1949, the day Chongqing was liberated, was a memorable day for the people of Chongqing and also for our factory. The PLA engineering corps entered the factory to clear the explosives; all the workers, under the leadership of the Party, began the work of restoring the factory. By 1951, all the machinery and equipment were running, and all the chimneys of the factory were smoking. I personally witnessed the factory rapidly growing from the ruins of serious damage, and this situation made me unable to restrain my joy.

　　In early 1950, the central government sent people to accompany several Soviet experts, including Malyshev, to the factory to understand the production situation. The Soviet experts believed that the factory had the conditions to produce large steel products. Later, we were tasked with producing steel rails for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. There was a large steam engine in the factory that had been lying in the mud for seven or eight years before liberation. Many parts were rusted and lost, leaving only the heavier herringbone gears and other components. In order to support the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the workers demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, manufactured important parts such as cylinder boring machines, and started installation. After only ten months of work, the installation was completed, the test run was good, and it was immediately put into production. Everyone did not expect that this steam engine could become an important piece of equipment for rolling large steel products. We used it to roll out the first steel rail of New China, and completed the task of supplying steel rails for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on schedule, realizing the plan to complete the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in two years.

　　In 1954, the workers heard the exciting news that the country was building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. What was even more exciting was that the higher authorities ordered us to produce various steel bars, flat steel, and angle steel needed for the construction of the bridge. Although we had not trial-produced many products such as "unequal angle steel". However, the workers actively overcame the difficulties in trial production to support the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction project.

　　Now, this factory has become the largest steel plant in Southwest China, and its products are supplied to more than 20 large and medium-sized cities across the country, as well as many mines, factories, and railway enterprises.

　　With the development of the country's industrial and transportation construction, the factory has trial-produced many new products in recent years. The successful trial production of each new product is the result of the combination of workers' rich production experience and engineering and technical personnel's scientific theoretical knowledge. When the factory was trial-producing light rails for mines, construction sites, etc., engineer Zou Chengzhu made the design and then revised it according to the workers' opinions. Therefore, the trial rolling of eight-kilogram and six-kilogram light rails was successful twice.

　　In just five short years, the capacity of the factory's machinery and equipment has been fully utilized. Now the production capacity of the original steelmaking open hearth furnace has more than doubled. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the output of pig iron accordingly. The iron-smelting blast furnace adopted the suggestions of Soviet experts, promoted the furnace top regulation method, and established a material yard management system, and the output of pig iron has also been continuously increasing. Due to the increase in steel production, refractory materials are in short supply. However, with the active efforts of the workers in the refractory materials workshop, the "fast kiln firing method" was promoted. Compared with the same period in 1954, each kiln can be shortened by 29 hours, ensuring supply; at the same time, new products such as high-aluminum water jacket bricks, high-aluminum surface-shaped steel ingot bucket bricks, and high-aluminum plugs were successfully trial-produced, which played a great role in improving the quality of steel ingots, extending the life of steelmaking open hearth furnaces and steel ingot buckets, and eliminating steel leakage accidents. But this does not mean that the capacity of the factory's machinery and equipment has reached its peak. As long as we earnestly implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, promote advanced experience, and improve equipment, tools, and operating techniques, output can still be increased. Take the original open hearth furnace as an example, its production has more than doubled in recent years. In 1954, Soviet expert Naidovsky came to the factory and told us that as long as we find a way to improve the quality of gas, its production can still be increased. We mobilized the workers, organized technical forces, worked hard to improve the quality of gas, and resolutely implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, which did increase production.

　　We can use numbers to illustrate the growth of production. Assuming that several major products in the factory were each one hundred in 1950, then by 1954, pig iron was 1,145 percent; steel ingots were 1,069 percent; steel was 764 percent; and refractory materials were 657 percent. Heavy rails reached 699 percent by 1953. This is simply incomparable to before liberation.

　　In the five years since liberation, the factory's production has greatly developed, and the lives of the workers have gradually improved. The days of living in caves, eating wild vegetables, and suffering from hunger and cold before liberation are gone forever. In 1951, a consumer cooperative was established in the factory, with an annual turnover of only 66,000 yuan, which increased to 2.94 million yuan in 1954. This year, workers purchased nearly 230,000 yuan in government bonds. Eight or ninety percent of the workers have savings in the bank. The total amount of deposits reached more than 550,000 yuan.

　　By the end of 1954, the factory had built 420 dormitories for workers' families and single workers. The vast majority of workers had moved from dilapidated thatched shacks and caves into new homes. The factory established spare-time middle schools and technical schools, and more than 1,000 workers and their families have improved from illiterate to upper primary school level. More than 700 ordinary workers have been promoted to technicians. The factory has also successively built hospitals, nutrition canteens, sanatoriums, cinemas, workers' clubs, skating rinks, etc. The appearance of the factory has been completely renewed, and the scene of poverty before liberation has been replaced by prosperous streets. In recent years, the factory administration and the trade union have jointly allocated more than 1.32 million yuan of labor insurance funds. Great improvements have also been made in labor protection.

　　The workers have great hopes and confidence in the future development of the factory. The two new steelmaking open hearth furnaces built by the factory in 1954 have been put into production, eliminating the imbalance of the original equipment. The equipment capacity of steelmaking and steel rolling has been balanced, and production has been greatly improved. Now the factory administration is comprehensively considering the overall planning and design of the factory, changing its entire appearance. It is not difficult to imagine that the factory will become one of the iron and steel centers in Southwest China in the future. All workers must work hard to improve their technical and management levels, and strive to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the state plan.

　　一零一钢铁厂的生产在飞速增长
　　西南钢铁公司副总工程师　张如宾
    西南钢铁公司所属一零一钢铁厂，在抗日战争爆发那一年，从上海迁到武汉，后又从武汉迁到重庆。它是由几个工厂的设备合并修建成的，包括动力、炼钢、炼铁、钢轨、耐火材料、机修、铆焊和铸造设备等。这些上万吨的机器设备，都是职工冒着敌机的轰炸抢运出来的。
    工厂在重庆兴建起来后，国民党反动政府不关心生产，只图依靠外国进货。除了用少数设备制造军火发动内战以外，大部分机器设备经常闲置着。就是生产一点产品，也无人问津。高耸的烟囱上看不到烟。厂内特务横行霸道，欺压职工。那时，作为一个工程师，对自己的前途感到消沉苦闷，想起来真是愤慨万分。
    重庆解放前夕，工厂遭受了蒋贼的严重破坏。厂内发电机被炸毁了，炼铁高炉也炸坏了，全厂陷入黑暗恐怖的世界。可是，共产党员和许多职工在敌人溃退后，就立即冒着生命危险搬运炸药，抢救工厂，有十七个人在搬运炸药中光荣牺牲。
    一九四九年十一月三十日重庆解放了，这一天是重庆人民也是我厂一个值得纪念的日子。解放军工兵部队进厂清理了炸药；全体职工在党的领导下开始了工厂的恢复工作。到一九五一年，全部机器设备动起来，全厂的烟囱冒了烟。我亲眼看到工厂从遭受严重的破坏的废墟上迅速地成长起来，这种情景使我抑制不住我的欢欣。
    一九五○年初，中央派人陪同马尔歇夫等几位苏联专家来到工厂了解生产情况，苏联专家们认为工厂有条件生产大型钢材。后来，我们就担负了为成渝铁路生产钢轨的任务。厂内有部大型蒸汽机，解放前在泥里躺了七、八年，许多配件锈坏和被丢失了，只剩下较沉重的人字牙轮等机件。职工们为了支援成渝铁路的修建，发挥高度的积极性和创造性，制造了搪缸器等重要配件，动手安装。经过短短十个月的工夫，就安装完毕，试车情况良好，立即投入生产。大家没有想到这部蒸汽机能变成轧制大型钢材的重要设备。我们就是用它轧出了新中国的第一根钢轨，并且按期完成供应成渝铁路钢轨的任务，实现了两年修通成渝铁路的计划。
    一九五四年，职工们听到国家修建武汉大桥的令人兴奋的消息。更令人兴奋的是上级命令我们生产修建大桥需要的各种钢筋、扁钢、角钢等任务。虽然许多产品如“不等边角钢”等，我们没有试制过。可是职工们都积极地克服了试制中的困难，支援武汉大桥修建工程。
    现在，这个工厂已经成为西南最大的钢铁厂，它的产品供应着全国二十多个大中城市，以及许多矿山、工厂和铁路企业。
    随着国家工业、交通建设事业的发展，几年来工厂试制的新产品是很多的。每件新产品的试制成功，都是工人们丰富的生产经验和工程技术人员的科学理论知识相结合的成果。工厂试制矿山、工地等用的轻轨时，工程师邹承祖做好设计以后，又根据工人意见作了修正，因此，试轧八公斤和六公斤的轻轨都是两次就试轧成功。
    短短的五年光景，工厂机器设备能力得到充分发挥。现在原有的炼钢平炉生产能力提高了一倍多。因此需要相应地提高生铁的产量。炼铁高炉采用苏联专家建议，推行炉顶调剂法，建立料场管理制度，生铁产量也不断增加。由于钢铁生产量增加，耐火材料呈现供不应求的趋势。可是在耐火材料车间职工的积极努力下，推行了“快速烧窑法”，今年二月和一九五四年同期比较，每窑可缩短二十九小时，保证了供应；同时又试制成功高铝水套砖、高铝面形盛钢桶砖以及高铝塞头等新产品，对提高钢锭质量、延长炼钢平炉和盛钢桶的寿命，对消灭漏钢事故起了很大作用。但是这并不是说工厂机器设备能力已发挥到了顶点，只要认真贯彻苏联专家建议，推广先进经验、改进设备、工具和操作技术，产量还可以提高。拿原有的平炉为例，几年来，它的生产量已经提高一倍多。一九五四年苏联专家纳依道夫斯基来厂，他告诉我们只要设法提高煤气的质量，它的生产量还可以提高。我们发动了职工、组织技术力量，努力提高煤气质量，坚决地执行了苏联专家的建议，的确又增加了生产。
    我们可以用数字来说明生产增长的情况。假设厂内几种主要产品在一九五○年各是一百，那末到一九五四年生铁是百分之一千一百四十五；钢锭是百分之一千零六十九；钢材是百分之七百六十四；耐火材料是百分之六百五十七。重轨到一九五三年是百分之六百九十九。这和解放前简直是无法相比的。
    解放五年来，工厂生产有了很大的发展，职工生活也逐步得到改善。解放前那种住岩洞、吃野菜、饥寒交迫的日子是一去不复返了。一九五一年厂内设立了消费合作社，全年营业额只有六万六千元，一九五四年增加到二百九十四万元。今年职工认购公债将近二十三万元。职工中十分之八、九在银行里有存款。存款总数达五十五万多元。
    到一九五四年年底，工厂给职工家属、单身职工修建了四百二十幢宿舍，绝大部分职工都从破烂不堪的茅草棚子、岩洞搬进了新的住宅。工厂创办了业余中学、技术学校，职工和眷属从文盲提高到高小程度的有一千多人。由普通工人提升为技工的有七百多人。厂内还陆续修建了医院、营养食堂、疗养所、电影院、工人俱乐部、溜冰场等。工厂四周的面貌已焕然一新，解放前的一片贫困景象已为繁华的市街所代替。几年来工厂行政和工会共拨出了一百三十二多万元的劳动保险基金。在劳动保护方面同样有了很大改善。
    职工们对工厂发展远景怀着极大的希望和信心。一九五四年工厂新建的两座炼钢平炉已投入生产，消除了原有设备不平衡的现象。平衡了炼钢和轧钢的设备能力，生产又有很大提高。现在工厂行政正通盘考虑工厂整体的规划设计，改变它的整个面貌。不难想像，工厂将来会成为西南钢铁中心之一。全体职工都要努力提高技术水平和管理水平，争取全面完成和超额完成国家计划。
