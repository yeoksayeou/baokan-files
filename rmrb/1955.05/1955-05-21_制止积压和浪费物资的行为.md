Curb the Accumulation and Waste of Materials

For several years, the material supply work of the industrial and construction sectors has basically guaranteed the progress of industrial production and construction projects, and the level of management has also improved. However, this work is still a very weak link in the entire enterprise management. On the one hand, there are still disconnections between supply and demand, and on the other hand, the phenomenon of material and equipment accumulation and waste is extremely serious. According to incomplete statistics from the supervisory offices of the central industrial and construction departments in 1954: in more than 280 enterprises, the accumulation of materials reached more than 340 million yuan; in more than 80 enterprises, due to improper use, poor storage, or embezzlement and theft, the loss and waste of various materials was nearly 10 million yuan. This prevents the state's large amount of capital from playing its due role, affects the normal turnover of enterprise funds, and hinders the implementation of the economic accounting system.

The reasons for these phenomena, in addition to the limitations of the level of planning work and technical equipment conditions, and the lack of management experience, are more importantly that many enterprise leaders have long held the idea of ​​one-sidedly pursuing output and progress, ignoring the saving of state property; many staff members have very weak concepts of planning and cherishing state property, and some staff members are seriously irresponsible.

Some people say: "Completing the task is the biggest saving, it doesn't matter if there is a little accumulation and waste." They are complacent about the completion of output and progress, and do not strictly implement the conservation system, and adopt an indifferent and indifferent attitude towards serious material accumulation and waste. They do not understand that to carry out the great cause of socialist construction, we must use our funds reasonably, correctly and sparingly. Especially since my country's current technical level is not high, and the production of many materials cannot meet the needs, any unit that accumulates or wastes state materials will inevitably weaken the country's material strength for construction and affect the material supply in other areas.

Some people say: "Today the task is heavy, the requirements are urgent, and the experience is insufficient, and accumulation and waste are unavoidable." Although this sentence has some truth, we must never completely attribute the accumulation and waste of materials to objective difficulties. Because in fact, a lot of material accumulation and waste is caused by the shortcomings and mistakes in our work. If we strengthen our work and overcome our shortcomings, many material accumulation and waste phenomena can be avoided or reduced.

At present, many units one-sidedly emphasize ensuring supply, but do not pay attention to saving. They often "guarantee supply with a large amount of reserves"; they blindly apply to the state or purchase materials from the market, without actively improving the level of supply planning and establishing and improving the material quota system. When compiling supply plans, they do not calculate based on production or engineering tasks, consumption quotas, and reserve quotas, and do not deeply understand the inventory, "rather more than less", and arbitrarily estimate; some even mechanically copy the past plans; some materials already have a large backlog in inventory, and they continue to purchase. They do not strengthen the review of supply plans, and even blindly increase the plan at all levels, forming a phenomenon of "quotas greater than actual, plans greater than quotas, and purchases greater than plans." After causing a large accumulation of materials, they still do not actively deal with it, allowing it to accumulate, corrode, and be damaged for a long time. Some are afraid of "trouble" or for the sake of "convenience in the future", and are unwilling to transfer it out even if they don't use it themselves. They relax the management of materials, and do not actively establish and improve the management system for material procurement, storage, receipt and dispatch, statistics, return of materials, and recycling; they do not strengthen the control and supervision of the use of materials, and even fail to seriously deal with some seriously irresponsible personnel who cause major losses to state property and embezzlers and thieves. These are very unfavorable to the country's construction cause and must be criticized and corrected.

Resolutely implement the conservation system, curb the serious accumulation and waste of materials, and attach importance to and strengthen material supply work, which is now an urgent task.

The leaders of all enterprises must fully recognize the important significance of saving materials, strictly criticize and correct the idea of ​​one-sidedly pursuing output and progress while ignoring savings, and regard the implementation of the conservation system, strengthening the leadership and supervision of material supply work, and opposing accumulation and waste as a regular and important task. At the same time, it is necessary to educate the broad masses of workers to cherish state property and strengthen the concept of planning; reward workers who have made significant achievements in saving materials, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and summarize and promote the existing domestic experience in saving materials. We must mobilize the broad masses of workers to expose and criticize acts of embezzlement, theft, and waste of state property, and fight against these bad phenomena; embezzlers and thieves must be dealt with seriously; those who are seriously irresponsible and cause major losses to state property must be held accountable.

Improving the planning level of material supply work and overcoming blindness is the fundamental way to implement conservation and overcome accumulation and waste. In this work, not only should the correctness of industrial production and engineering construction plans be gradually improved, the tasks of production and engineering should be determined as soon as possible, the progress of design should be accelerated, and the state's plans should be strictly implemented, and the procedures prescribed for the compilation of supply plans should be strictly followed, but also the quota system must be established and improved, and reasonable consumption quotas and reserve quotas must be formulated. To this end, we must gradually improve the enterprise statistical system and systematically collect and sort out various quota data; at the same time, financial and supply departments at all levels should strengthen the review of supply plans and correct the blind conservatism and departmentalism in the preparation of plans.

Establishing and improving various management systems for material supply work and strengthening material management work to prevent the phenomenon of no one being responsible is of particular importance. First of all, the material requisition and return system should be implemented to strengthen the supervision of material use. Any unit can only requisition materials according to the plan, and it is absolutely not allowed to "requisition whatever is needed, requisition as much as is needed." The quota requisition system that has been implemented in some enterprises is an effective method to prevent losses and waste of materials in use, and enterprises can gradually promote it in accordance with specific conditions. The waste material recycling system, especially the recycling system for various waste metals, must also be established and improved.

A considerable part of the current accumulated materials are materials and equipment that are usually necessary for production and construction, and each unit should actively deal with them immediately. These accumulated materials must first be actively used in the unit; if they cannot be disposed of, they should be reported level by level, and combined with the material distribution work, they should be balanced and transferred level by level to make the large amount of accumulated materials play their due role as soon as possible. In the work of handling material accumulation, one should not simply "complete the handling task", carelessly scrap many useful materials, or treat useful machinery and equipment as scrap iron to be returned to the furnace.

Finally, it is also necessary to strengthen the leadership and supervision of material supply work. Leaders at all levels of each department should study and adopt specific measures to effectively strengthen material supply work, gradually solve the problems existing in the work, enrich the grassroots organizations of material supply work, formulate necessary systems, and strengthen inspection and supervision work.

Party committees at all levels should strengthen the leadership and supervision of this work. Supervisory organs at all levels should also strengthen the supervision and inspection of this work, resolutely curb the accumulation and waste of materials, carry out a resolute struggle against embezzlers and thieves, and urge and promote business departments to overcome the shortcomings in material supply work. Only in this way can we effectively curb the serious behavior of accumulating and wasting materials, and make all materials play a greater role in the country's socialist construction cause.

### 制止积压和浪费物资的行为

　　制止积压和浪费物资的行为
    工业和建筑部门的物资供应工作，几年来基本上保证了工业生产和建筑工程的进行，管理水平也有所提高。但是，这项工作在整个企业管理中目前仍然是一个极薄弱的环节。一方面供应和需要还有脱节的现象，另一方面材料和设备的积压浪费现象也极严重。根据中央各工业、建筑部门监察室一九五四年的不完整统计：在二百八十多个企业单位中，材料积压共达三亿四千多万元；在八十多个企业单位中，由于使用不当、保管不善或被贪污盗窃，各种物资损失和浪费近一千万元。这就使国家大量资财不能发挥应有的效能，也影响企业资金的正常周转，阻碍经济核算制度的贯彻。
    产生这些现象的原因，除了计划工作水平和技术设备条件的限制以及经营管理经验不足以外，更重要的是不少企业领导人员长期存在片面地追求产量、进度，忽视节约国家资财的思想；很多工作人员计划观念和爱护国家资财的观念十分薄弱和有些工作人员严重地不负责任。
    有些人说：“完成任务就是最大的节约，积压浪费一点算不了什么。”他们沾沾自喜于产量和进度的完成，不去严格地贯彻节约制度，对严重的物资积压和浪费现象采取了漠不关心、熟视无睹的态度。他们不了解，要进行伟大的社会主义建设事业，就必须合理地、正确地节约使用我们的资金。尤其是我国目前技术水平不高，许多物资的生产还不能满足需要，任何一个单位积压或浪费了国家物资，都必然会削弱国家建设的物质力量，影响到其他方面的物资供应。
    有些人说：“今天任务重，要求急，经验不足，积压浪费是不能避免的。”这句话虽然有一定的道理，但是我们绝不能把物资的积压和浪费完全归咎于客观困难。因为事实上很多物资的积压和浪费是由于我们工作中的缺点和错误造成的。如果我们加强了工作，克服了缺点，有不少物资的积压和浪费现象是可以避免或减少的。
    目前有不少单位片面地强调保证供应，而不注意节约，他们往往是“以大量储备来保证供应”；他们盲目地向国家申请或向市场采购物资，而不积极提高供应计划水平，建立和健全材料定额制度。在编制供应计划的时候，他们不根据生产或工程任务、消耗定额和储备定额进行核算，不深入了解库存量，“宁多勿少”，随意估计；有的竟机械地照抄过去的计划；有的材料库存已有大量积压，仍去继续采购。他们不加强对供应计划的审查工作，甚至还层层盲目地加大计划，形成“定额大于实际，计划大于定额，采购又大于计划”的现象。他们在造成物资大量积压以后，仍不积极处理，任其长期积压、腐蚀和毁损。有的怕“麻烦”或者为了“以后用起来方便”，虽然自己不用也不愿意向外调拨。他们放松了对物资的管理工作，不积极去建立和健全材料采购、保管、收发、统计、退料、回收等管理制度；不加强对材料使用的控制和监督，甚至对一些严重不负责任造成国家资财重大损失的人员和贪污盗窃分子也不加以严肃处理。这些对国家的建设事业都是非常不利的，必须批判和纠正。
    坚决贯彻节约制度，制止物资的严重积压和浪费行为，重视并加强物资供应工作，这是当前刻不容缓的。
    各企业的领导人员，必须充分认识节约物资的重要意义，严格批判和纠正片面追求产量、进度而忽视节约的思想，要把贯彻节约制度，加强对物资供应工作的领导和监督，反对积压浪费作为一项经常的重要任务。同时要教育广大职工爱护国家资财，加强计划观念；奖励对节约物资有显著成绩的职工，学习苏联先进经验，总结和推广国内已有的节约物资的经验。我们必须动员广大职工揭发和批评贪污盗窃和浪费国家资财的行为，向这些不良现象进行斗争；对贪污盗窃分子必须严肃处理；对严重不负责任的造成国家资财重大损失的人员必须追究责任。
    提高物资供应工作的计划水平，克服盲目性，是实行节约、克服积压浪费的根本办法。在这项工作中，不但应该逐步提高工业生产和工程建设计划的正确性，尽早确定生产和工程的任务，加速设计进度和严格执行国家的计划，严格根据编制供应计划所规定的程序进行编制，而且必须建立和健全定额制度，制定合理的消耗定额和储备定额。为此，就要逐步健全企业统计制度，有计划地搜集整理各种定额资料；同时，各级财务、供应部门应加强对供应计划的审核工作，纠正编制计划中的盲目保守和本位主义思想。
    建立和健全物资供应工作的各项管理制度，加强材料管理工作，防止无人负责现象，具有特殊重要的意义。首先要贯彻领料和退料制度，加强对材料使用的监督。任何单位都只能根据计划领料，决不许“要什么，领什么，要多少，给多少”。目前有些企业中已经推行的限额领料制，是防止物资在使用中造成损失和浪费的有效方法，各企业可按照具体条件逐步推广。废料回收制度，特别是各种废金属的回收制度，也必须注意建立和健全起来。
    目前的积压物资中有相当大的一部分是生产和建筑上通常必需的材料和设备，各单位应即积极处理。这些积压的物资必须先在本单位积极设法利用；无法处理的应逐级上报，结合物资分配工作，逐级平衡调拨处理，使大量的积压物资及早发挥应有的效能。在处理物资积压的工作中，不应该单纯为了“完成处理任务”，把许多有用的物资轻率地报废或把有用的机器设备当作废铁回炉。
    最后，还必须加强对物资供应工作的领导和监督。各部门各级领导人员应研究采取具体措施，切实地加强物资供应工作，逐步解决工作中存在的问题，充实物资供应工作的基层组织，制定必要的制度，加强检查和监督工作。
    各级党委应加强对这项工作的领导和监督。各级监察机关也应加强对这项工作的监督和检查，要坚决制止物资的积压和浪费，要同贪污盗窃分子进行坚决的斗争，督促并推动业务部门克服物资供应工作中的缺点。这样才能有效地制止积压和浪费物资的严重行为，使所有的物资在国家的社会主义建设事业中发挥更大的作用。
