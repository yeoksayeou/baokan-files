　  The renovation of the eastern section of the Kangzang Highway, the more than 700-kilometer stretch from Ya'an to Manigange, has fully commenced with over a hundred newly constructed, reconstructed, and reinforced projects this year. More than 1,600 Han and Tibetan workers are working intensely in the high mountains and deep valleys at an average altitude of about 3,000 meters above sea level.
    After several years of active maintenance, the eastern section of the Kangzang Highway has basically eliminated the phenomena of vehicles getting stuck, slipping, or being blocked. This year, we will further focus on reinforcing, widening, reducing slopes, and renovating sharp bends in some areas with unstable roadbeds, narrow road surfaces, steep gradients, and sharp curves. Retaining walls, guardrails, passing lanes, and signposts will be built along the mountainside routes. River embankments will be built in some sections close to rivers that are easily eroded by floods. Some temporary bridges will be rebuilt into permanent two-lane stone-platformed wooden-decked bridges with ice-proof layers, learning from advanced Soviet experience. Currently, over 30,000 saplings of poplar, locust, willow, and Fraxinus sinesis trees are being planted along the roadside.
    Liu Haitong, chief engineer of the Kangding National Highway Administration, said: "After the completion of these projects, the driving speed will be increased by 2 to 5 kilometers per hour, further ensuring smooth and safe transportation." (Xinhua News Agency)

　  康藏公路东段开始整修
    康藏公路东段雅安到马尼根果七百多公里长的一段今年新建、改建、加固的一百多处工程，已经全面动工。一千六百多名汉、藏族工人正在拔海平均三千公尺左右的高山、深谷间紧张地施工。
    康藏公路东段经过几年来的积极养护，已经基本上消灭了陷车、滑车、阻车的现象。今年将进一步在某些路基不稳、路面较窄、坡度较大、弯道较急的地方，进行重点加固、加宽、降坡和整修急弯的工程。在傍山路线上将修建起保坎、护栏、避车道和标号志，在某些紧靠河道易被洪水冲毁的地段将修起河堤，有些便桥将学习苏联先进经验改建成双车道石台木面、并设置防冰层的永久性桥梁。现在三万多株杨、槐、柳、菁杠等树苗正分植在沿线道旁。
    康定国道管理局总工程师刘海通说：这些工程完工后，将使行车速度每小时提高二至五公里，进一步保证运输上的畅通和安全。		（新华社）
