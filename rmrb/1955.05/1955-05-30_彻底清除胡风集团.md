　　Thoroughly Eliminate the Hu Feng Group
　　Luo Changpei

　　Hu Feng, for a long time and consistently, wore the cloak of Marxism, but secretly he was actively promoting idealist wares; he shouted anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, but secretly he was anti-Party and anti-people. His conspiracy has now been completely exposed, and this disguised swindler can no longer deceive anyone. This is a great victory in searching for enemies hidden in the revolutionary ranks.

　　Once we understand his ideological roots and political stance, it is not difficult to understand why he was so hateful, so full of "murderous intent" towards progressive literary writers inside and outside the Party, the Party's literary policies, and leaders of literary work. When his wings were not yet fully grown, he was carrying out counter-revolutionary activities with the "tactic of Sun Wukong entering the belly," speaking sweet words but harboring evil intentions. He wanted to sharpen his sword and "survey the direction." Once the "opportunity" arrived, he would use the "tactic of cluster hand grenades" to attack the revolutionary ranks. But he was "blinded by optimistic estimates and finally acted rashly." In the face of the Party and the people's sharp eyes, his conspiracy was finally exposed, and the attack failed. He even dreamed of preserving "strength" in retreat, "seeking rebirth in endurance, all for the cause, for a more distant future!" What a vicious enemy! But there will never be the "opportunity" he wanted to "wait" for again.

　　However, we must be more vigilant and learn full lessons from the Hu Feng incident. Isn't the Taiwan radio station applauding Hu Feng greatly? We must always be wary of enemies hidden in the revolutionary ranks and strive to eliminate the idealist poison that remains in our minds.

　　彻底清除胡风集团
　　罗常培
    胡风长期而一贯地披着马克思主义的外衣，暗中却在积极推销唯心论的货色；口口声声喊着反帝、反封建，暗中却在反党、反人民。他的阴谋现在完全被揭穿了，这个伪装的大骗子再也骗不了任何人了。这是对隐藏在革命阵营中的敌人进行搜索的伟大胜利。
    我们弄清楚了他的思想根源和政治立场，就不难了解为什么他对党内外的进步文艺作家和党的文艺政策以及文艺工作领导者那样仇恨，那样充满了“杀机”。他在羽翼未丰的时候，“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，口蜜腹剑地在进行反革命活动，他是想磨他的剑，“窥测方向”。等到一旦“时机”到来，就要用“集束手榴弹的战术”向革命阵营进攻。但是他“被乐观估计所蔽，终于冒进”了，在党和人民雪亮的眼睛面前，他的阴谋终于被揭露，进攻失败了。他还梦想在退却中保存“实力”，“在忍受中求得重生，一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来！”好凶狠的敌人！可是再也没有他所要“等待”的“机会”了。
    然而我们必需提高警惕，要从胡风事件中取得充分的教训。台湾的广播电台不是大替胡风喝采吗？我们要时时刻刻提防着隐藏在革命阵营中的敌人，要努力清除残留在我们思想中的唯心论的毒素。
