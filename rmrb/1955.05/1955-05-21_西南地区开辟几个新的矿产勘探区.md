　　Advancing on the Road of Socialism
　　Several New Mineral Exploration Zones Opened in Southwest China
    The Southwest Geological Bureau has newly opened several mineral exploration zones with very rich reserves this year. Near a mine in Yunnan Province, geological workers discovered thick coal seams with large reserves only a few meters below the surface. An iron ore mine explored this year is estimated to have a considerable amount and quality of iron ore reserves. The new phosphate mine exploration zones in Emei, Sichuan Province, and Kunyang, Yunnan Province, both have substantial reserves. A general survey in 1954 proved that the Kunyang phosphate mine has a wide distribution area, thick ore seams, and a high grade of phosphorus content, and some parts can be mined openly. At the same time, both phosphate mine areas are close to highways, making transportation very convenient.
    The Southwest Geological Bureau has strengthened its exploration forces this year. The higher-level leading authorities have transferred a group of drilling technicians, administrative staff, and political workers from geological departments in the Northwest, Central South, North China, and various Party organizations in the Southwest. In addition to opening new exploration zones, the Southwest Geological Bureau, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry, and the Guizhou Provincial Department of Industry will also vigorously carry out mineral prospecting work to provide more reserve bases for future exploration of phosphate mines and other minerals.

　　在社会主义的道路上前进
　　西南地区开辟几个新的矿产勘探区
    西南地质局今年新开辟了几个蕴藏量十分丰富的矿产勘探区。在云南省一个矿山附近，地质工作者在离地面只几公尺深的地方就探到了储量很多的厚煤层。今年勘探的一个铁矿，估计蕴藏的铁矿石的数量和质量都很可观。四川省峨眉、云南省昆阳两地的新磷矿勘探区，蕴藏量都相当丰富。一九五四年普查证明，昆阳磷矿的矿区分布很广，矿层厚，含磷的品位高，有一部分并可作露天开采。同时，这两个磷矿区都紧靠公路线，运输条件很方便。
    西南地质局，今年加强了勘探力量。上级领导机关已经从西北、中南、华北等地地质部门和西南各地党的机关调了一批钻探技术工人、行政工作人员和政治工作人员。除了开辟新的勘探区外，西南地质局、四川省工业厅、贵州省工业厅等还将大力开展矿产普查工作，为今后磷矿等的勘探提供更多的后备基地。
