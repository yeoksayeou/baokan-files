Letter from Feng Baoguang, a worker at the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory: After reading some of the materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, I am extremely angry. The Party and the people united with him and trusted him so much, but he was doing anti-Party and anti-people activities, like a rabid dog, frantically attacking the Party and the people. He viciously called the most trusted staff of the Chinese Communist Party "powerful figures," "emissaries," and "masters." He deeply hated the revolutionary cause, but shamelessly proclaimed himself as "the organizer of literary work standing around the Party." The people will no longer agree to let such a hateful leader of an anti-Party and anti-people group be a deputy to the National People's Congress. People have been fooled by him enough, and it is time to settle accounts with him.

We will never allow such an extremely reactionary political conspirator like Hu Feng to serve as a representative of the people, and we cannot allow him to use the "whip wrapped in rubber" to lash the revolutionary cause any longer. At the same time, I also suggest that the Chinese Writers Association also clean him out, and not let him paralyze the masses under the guise of a revolutionary writer. Our working class will distinguish between friends and enemies, and we will no longer be deceived by him. At the same time, I hope that all those who have been deceived by him and followed him will turn back quickly! Honestly surrender to the people and lay down your arms! Transform yourselves in the great socialist construction of the motherland! Now is the time to wake up.

Letter from Tang Qi, Tianjin First Workers' Cultural Palace: Everyone knows that revolutionary literary and art workers had no freedom of assembly in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and were constantly subjected to cruel persecution. The democratic fighter Wen Yiduo was murdered, and many revolutionaries were imprisoned in Kuomintang secret service agencies and suffered severe torture. One of the torture instruments was precisely the "whip wrapped in rubber" used by Hu Feng. Hu Feng used such vicious tactics to treat revolutionary literature and art. How is this different from the Kuomintang secret agents? What qualifications does he have to be a deputy to the National People's Congress? I demand that his qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress be revoked!

Letter from Liang Xianming, Planning Department of the Beijing Fuxingmenwai Electrical Appliance Industry Administration Bureau: Hu Feng has become an enemy of the revolution and is not worthy of being a writer of the new China. Therefore, we not only demand that Hu Feng be purged from the literary and art ranks, but also that Hu Feng be purged from the ranks of the great and solemn National People's Congress deputies. At the same time, we must thoroughly investigate the criminal activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique.

Letter from Luo Chenxin, Zhang Yinde, Liu Jianwu, Cai Xuezhou, Wang Ruyi and others from Henan Rongjun General School, Xinxiang City: Since the "People's Daily" published the part of Hu Feng anti-Party group's crimes revealed by Shu Wu, we realized that Hu Feng was originally a conspirator who carried out anti-Party and anti-people activities in secret under the banner of revolution. For many years, Hu Feng deceived our Party and the broad masses of people, stole the qualifications of a deputy to the National People's Congress, and occupied important positions such as director of the Chinese Writers Association and member of the editorial board of "People's Literature". We believe that the deputies to the highest state power organ - the National People's Congress - should and must be outstanding figures who are loyal to the people's revolutionary cause, enjoy prestige among the people, and can live up to the people's trust, and we must never allow a political swindler like Hu Feng to continue to occupy it; at the same time, in the revolutionary literary and art organizations that carry out socialist education for the people of the whole country, Hu Feng must never be allowed to mix in again. Therefore, we suggest that the relevant organs and groups promptly conduct research and make decisions to revoke all of Hu Feng's current positions, especially please ask the original electoral unit to study the issue of revoking Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress.

Letter from Jin Xiaobing of an air force base of the People's Liberation Army: In his "My Self-Criticism," Hu Feng said: "I have always used Chairman Mao's instruction of 'the difference between environment and task' to defend my limitations and wrong positions..." In fact, Hu Feng is playing despicable double-dealing tricks here. "The fake is fake, and the disguise should be stripped off." Let's talk about "the difference between environment and task." Since 1944, the environment in which Hu Feng was in, as he himself said, was not in an environment of "standing around the Party"? Wasn't it in an environment where "some sacrificed martyrs and comrades who have been fighting loyally have guided me, taught me, and some comrades have long persuaded me and looked forward to me" (please note that Hu Feng uses "comrades" here)? And Hu Feng dared to take "the difference between environment..." as his shield of defense!

In such an environment, Hu Feng called the Party "official," and in such an environment, Hu Feng called the comrades sent by the Party to help him and persuade him "mandarins," "gentry," "emissaries," "shopkeepers," "officials," "judges," "powerful figures," "young masters," etc. All the abusive words that Hu Feng thought were the most hateful were used, and Hu Feng's hatred for the Party was so strong!

I hope to continue to expose Hu Feng's anti-Party behavior. At the same time, as a citizen of the People's Republic of China, I suggest that the relevant authorities revoke his qualification as a deputy to the National People's Congress in accordance with the law.

Letter from Zou Yan, student of the Department of Telecommunications, Tianjin University: We cannot tolerate Hu Feng's crimes and will not allow him to continue to deceive us. I hope that the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Writers Association will remove Hu Feng, this anti-Party and anti-people conspirator, from the revolutionary literary and art organizations. I also hope that the original electoral unit that elected Hu Feng as a deputy to the National People's Congress will revoke his qualification as a deputy in accordance with the procedures prescribed by law.

Letter from Pan Huaxin, Beijing Taxation Bureau: The hideous face of Hu Feng, who is anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary, and his recent insidious and cunning attempt to play a false self-criticism to continue to be an enemy of the people, have aroused the unparalleled anger of the broad masses of people. I am a staff member of a state organ, and I suggest that the following necessary measures be taken immediately against Hu Feng, who is anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary:

1. Immediately revoke all of Hu Feng's positions in the literary and art circles and expel him from the Chinese Writers Association.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 38 of the Constitution, revoke Hu Feng's qualification as a deputy to the National People's Congress.

### 要求撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表资格

　　要求撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表资格
    国营北京第二棉纺织厂工人冯葆光来信：我看了揭发胡风反党集团的一部分材料，非常愤怒。党和人民那样团结他，信任他，但他却做着反党反人民的勾当，像一只疯狗，猖狂地向党向人民进攻。他把全国人民最信赖的中国共产党的工作人员恶毒地称为“权贵”、“钦差”、“老爷们”，对于革命事业深恶痛绝，但自己却恬不知耻地自封为“站在党底周围的文学工作的组织者”。对于这样一个反党反人民的集团的可恶头子，人民是不会再同意叫他当全国人民代表大会代表的，人们已经叫他蒙混得够了，是到了应该清算他的时候了。
    我们绝不允许像胡风这样的极端反动的政治阴谋家充当人民的代表，不能再让他用“橡皮包着钢丝”的鞭子抽打革命事业了。同时我还建议中国作家协会也把他清洗出去，不让他披着革命作家的外衣来麻痹群众。我们工人阶级是会分清敌友的，我们再不受他的骗了。同时希望一切受过他的骗，跟着他跑的人，赶快回头吧！老老实实地向人民投降，缴械！在祖国伟大的社会主义建设中改造自己吧！现在是醒过来的时候了。
    天津市第一工人文化宫汤奇来信：谁都知道，革命文艺工作者在国民党统治区没有集会自由，不断遭到残酷的迫害，民主战士闻一多被谋杀，许多革命人士被关在国民党特务机关里，饱受毒刑，而刑具的一种，就正是胡风所用的“橡皮包着钢丝”的“鞭子”，胡风使用这样的毒手来对待革命文艺工作，这和国民党特务有什么不同呢？他还有什么资格当全国人民代表大会的代表呢？我要求撤销他的全国人民代表大会的代表资格！
    北京复兴门外电器工业管理局计划处梁先明来信：胡风已经成为革命的敌人，不配作一个新中国的作家。因此我们不但要求把胡风从文艺队伍中清洗出去，也要求把胡风从伟大的庄严的全国人民代表大会的代表的行列中清洗出去。同时还要彻底追究胡风反党集团的罪恶活动。
    新乡市河南荣军总校罗臣信、张寅德、刘建武、蔡学周、王如一等人来信：自“人民日报”公布了舒芜所揭发的胡风反党集团的一部分罪行后，我们才知道，胡风原来是一个打着革命旗帜而暗中进行反党反人民活动的阴谋分子。多年以来，胡风欺骗了我们党和广大人民，窃取了全国人民代表大会代表的资格，窃居了中国作家协会理事、“人民文学”编委等重要的职位。我们认为最高国家权力机关——全国人民代表大会中的代表都应当而且必须是忠心于人民革命事业，在人民群众中享有威信、并能不负人民信赖的优秀人物，而决不能容许胡风这种政治上完全反动的大骗子再继续窃居其中；同时对全国人民进行社会主义教育的革命文艺团体里，也决不能容许胡风再混在里面。因此，我们建议有关机关、团体从速进行研究决定，撤销胡风现任的一切职务，特别是请原选举单位研究撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表资格的问题。
    解放军某空军基地金小兵来信：胡风在他的
  “我的自我批判”中说：“我过去一直用毛主席底‘环境和任务的区别’这一指示来替自己的局限性和错误立场辩护……”其实胡风在这里正是玩着卑鄙的两面派手腕。“假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去”。我们就说“环境和任务的区别”吧，自一九四四年以来，胡风所处的环境，如他自己所说的，不正是处在一个“站在党底周围”的环境中吗？不正是处在“一些牺牲了的先烈们和一直忠贞战斗着的同志们引导过我，教导过我，有些同志长期以来规劝过我，期待着我”（请注意，胡风在这里都是用的
  “同志”）的环境中吗？而胡风竟敢拿“环境……的区别”来作为他辩护的盾牌！
    就在这样的环境中，胡风称党为“官方”，就在这样的环境中，胡风把党派去帮助他、规劝他的同志称做“马褂”、“豪绅们”、“钦差”、“市侩”、
  “官们”、“法官”、“权贵”、“公子们”等等，一切胡风认为最解恨的骂人的话都用上了，胡风对党的仇恨是多么强烈！
    希望继续揭发胡风的反党行为。同时，我以中华人民共和国一个公民的资格提出建议，请有关机关按法律撤销他的全国人民代表大会的代表资格。
    天津大学电信系学生邹衍来信：我们不能容忍胡风的罪行，不允许他继续欺骗我们。我希望：中国文学艺术界联合会和作家协会把胡风这个反党反人民的阴谋家从革命的文艺组织中清除出去。我也希望把胡风选为全国人民代表大会代表的原选举单位，依照法律规定的程序撤销他的代表资格。
    北京税务总局潘华新来信：胡风反党、反人民、反革命的狰狞面貌，以及他最近还是阴险、奸诈地企图玩弄假检讨来继续与人民为敌的顽抗态度，已激起了广大人民群众的无比愤怒。我是国家机关工作人员，我建议对反党、反人民、反革命的胡风，立即作如下的必要的措置：
    一、立即撤销胡风在文艺界的一切职务，并开除他的中国作家协会会籍。
    二、根据宪法第三十八条的规定，撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会的代表资格。
