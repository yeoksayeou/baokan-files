Hubei Province Vigorously Prevents and Treats Schistosomiasis

The Hubei Provincial Department of Health has designated the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis as one of the key tasks of rural health work in the province this year. In late April, the department convened the first provincial conference on schistosomiasis prevention and treatment. At the meeting, a work policy of "integrating with production, mobilizing the masses, comprehensive prevention, focused treatment, and controlling development" was established. In this year's prevention and treatment work, social medical forces, especially traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, will be mobilized to participate in the work. In addition, three hundred cadres will be trained for schistosomiasis prevention and treatment.

Schistosomiasis is a chronic infectious disease prevalent in the lake areas of Hubei Province. Before liberation, it spread widely. The Kuomintang reactionary government ignored this infectious disease that harmed the health of the masses and allowed it to develop unchecked. After liberation, the Hubei Provincial Department of Health immediately began actively carrying out prevention and treatment work, successively establishing a schistosomiasis prevention and treatment institute, two schistosomiasis prevention and treatment stations, and twenty-one prevention and treatment teams. Over the past five years, a total of 8,591 patients with schistosomiasis have been treated. In the prevention and treatment work, some areas have paid attention to the management of feces and water sources, and the elimination of oncomelania snails carrying the pathogens. Huangmei County, in conjunction with the dike restoration project last winter and this spring, buried snail-infested areas of twenty-five li. Various localities have also combined the work of schistosomiasis prevention and treatment in the dike repair project. (Wang Zhaohuai)

　  湖北省大力防治血吸虫病
    湖北省卫生厅已把防治血吸虫病的工作列为全省今年农村卫生工作的重点之一。四月下旬，该厅召开了全省第一次血吸虫病防治工作会议。会上，确定了“结合生产、动员群众、全面预防、重点治疗、控制发展”的防治工作方针。在今年的防治工作中，将发动社会医药力量，特别是中医参加防治工作，还将培养三百名血吸虫病防治工作的干部。
    血吸虫病是湖北省湖沼地区一种慢性传染病，解放以前就蔓延很广，国民党反动政府对于危害群众健康的这种传染病，不闻不问，任其发展。解放以后，湖北省卫生厅即积极着手进行防治工作，先后建立了血吸虫病防治所、两个血吸虫病防治站和二十一个防治组，五年来共治疗了八千五百九十一个患血吸虫病的病人。在防治工作中，部分地区注意了粪便和水源的管理，消灭带病菌的钉螺丝。黄梅县结合去冬今春堤口复堤工程，就土埋了二十五里长的钉螺丝分布区。各地在修堤工程中也结合进行了防治血吸虫病的工作。　（王肇槐）
