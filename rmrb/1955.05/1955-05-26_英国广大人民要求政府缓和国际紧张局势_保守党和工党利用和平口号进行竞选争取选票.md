Xinhua News Agency, London, May 24th (TASS dispatch): With the British parliamentary elections approaching, various political parties in Britain are intensifying their election campaigns.

British observers agree that the central issue in this election campaign is the question of the line of British foreign policy and the issue of a summit meeting of the heads of government of the major powers. The broad masses of the British people are demanding that the British government work to ease international tensions and peacefully resolve all pressing issues through talks between the leaders of the four major powers. Therefore, the leaders of both the Conservative and Labour parties have made assurances that they will actively promote this meeting, bring about a cessation of the "Cold War," and improve international relations. Conservative leaders have made these promises a key issue in their election propaganda.

Prime Minister Eden, in many of his campaign speeches, spoke of his determination to do everything possible to ensure the smooth holding of a four-power summit conference. Speaking in Rugby, he emphasized that no steps should be taken "which would threaten negotiations with Russia." Speaking at a rally in Birmingham on the 23rd, Eden said again: "Our aim is to begin negotiations which can open the way to improving relations between East and West."

Soviet newspapers have revealed that some Western politicians are only paying lip service to negotiations without making genuine preparations. These comments from the Soviet press have made a strong impression on British public opinion. Taking this into account, Eden had to admit in his speech that the comments made by "Pravda" on this issue "are not unreasonable."

Regarding the criticism of the unreasonable demands made by Western countries regarding the location and timing of the four-power conference, Eden said: "As far as we are concerned, we have no fixed ideas on these issues." Eden further stated: "However, I hope we have ample time at this conference."

British Foreign Secretary Macmillan and other important figures in the Conservative Party have also made speeches in recent weeks about their willingness to improve the international situation.

Labour newspapers have called the Conservative campaign a "pre-election deception campaign." Many commentators close to the Labour Party say that the Conservatives' strategy is to use current promises to "gain political capital," and then, after the election, to put forward or support conditions and proposals regarding the agenda of the four-power conference that will make negotiations impossible, and then shift the blame for sabotaging the negotiations onto the Soviet Union. The "Tribune" weekly said that the Western countries' proposals for negotiations with the Soviet Union are merely "Conservative pre-election tricks."

Attlee and other Labour leaders also solemnly promised in the election campaign that if they were in power, they would work to improve the international situation, eliminate the danger of war, and successfully conduct summit talks between the major powers. Labour's Shawcross said in a speech in Lancashire on the 23rd that "a British Labour government may be better able to achieve successful negotiations."

Due to widespread domestic protests against attempts to drag Britain into the military adventures of American militarists in the Far East, Labour leaders promised to ensure that the rights of the Chinese people are respected and that the People's Republic of China gains its legitimate status in the United Nations.

Some domestic issues were also mentioned in the election campaigns of the Labour and Conservative parties. They mutually blamed each other for the responsibility for creating Britain's economic difficulties.

In the election campaign, the British ruling group took discriminatory measures against Communist candidates, preventing them from stating their election programs on radio and television. The British electoral system also gave the Conservative and Labour parties some superior rights.

### 英国广大人民要求政府缓和国际紧张局势  保守党和工党利用和平口号进行竞选争取选票

　　英国广大人民要求政府缓和国际紧张局势
    保守党和工党利用和平口号进行竞选争取选票
    新华社二十五日讯　据塔斯社伦敦二十四日讯：英国议会选举就要举行，英国的各个政党都加紧了它们的竞选活动。
    英国观察家一致认为，在这次选举运动中占中心地位的是关于英国外交政策的路线问题和关于大国政府首脑会谈问题。英国广大人民要求英国政府努力于缓和国际紧张局势和通过四大国领袖会谈来和平解决一切迫切的问题。因此保守党和工党的领袖都提出保证说，他们将积极促成这一会谈，促使
  “冷战”停止和改进国际关系。保守党的领袖们把这些诺言当作了竞选宣传中的主要问题。
    艾登首相在他所作的许多次竞选演说中，谈到他决心竭尽一切力量，以保证能够顺利举行四大国最高级会议。他在雷格比讲话时着重说，决不容许采取“使同俄国的谈判受到威胁的任何步骤”。艾登二十三日在伯明翰的一次集会上讲话时又说：“我们的目的是要开始一个能为改善东西方之间的关系开辟道路的谈判。”
    苏联报纸揭露说，某些西方政界人士只是空谈谈判，而不作真正的准备。苏联报纸的这种言论在英国舆论界中间造成了强烈的印象。艾登考虑到这一点，只好在演说中承认：“真理报”就这个问题发表的言论“并不是不合理的”。
    关于西方国家对四国会议的地点和时间的无理要求所受到的批评，艾登说道：“至于谈到我们，那末我们对这些问题没有固定的想法。”艾登进一步说道：“但是，我希望我们在这一会议上有充分的时间。”
    英国外交大臣麦克米伦和保守党的其他重要人物在最近几个星期中也发表了关于他们愿意改善国际局势的谈话。
    工党报纸把保守党的竞选运动叫做“选举前的欺骗运动”。接近工党的许多评论员说，保守党的策略是利用目前的诺言来“获得政治资本”，而在选举以后提出或支持那些将使谈判不能举行的关于四国会议议程的条件和建议，然后把破坏谈判的罪过转嫁到苏联身上。“论坛”周报说，西方国家关于同苏联谈判的建议只是“保守党选举前的花招”。
    艾德礼和其他工党领袖在竞选运动中也郑重保证说，他们如果执政，就要致力于改善国际局势，消除战争危险和圆满地进行大国首脑谈判。工党的肖克劳斯二十三日在兰开夏演说时说，“英国工党政府可能更能够使谈判获得圆满结果”。
    由于英国国内广泛抗议把英国拖入美国军国主义者在远东的军事冒险的企图，工党领袖答应要使中国人民的权利受到尊重，使中华人民共和国在联合国中获得合法地位。
    在工党和保守党的竞选宣传中还提到了一些内政问题。它们相互推诿造成英国经济困难的责任。
    在竞选运动中，英国统治集团对共产党候选人采取歧视措施，使他们不能够在电台和电视台申述自己的竞选纲领。英国的选举制度还给了保守党和工党一些优越的权利。
