　　Basic-Level Cadres Must Lead by Example in Grain Unified Sales Work
　　Liu Jichuan, Deputy Secretary of the Sixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China

　　Recently, while inspecting grain unified sales work in the Nanxu District, I felt that educating basic-level cadres to lead by example and correctly implement the Party and government's policies is an important condition for doing this work well. In the Datang and Qianyang electoral districts of Changgang Township, Nanxu District, basic-level cadres have two types of ideological styles, and the unified sales work in these two electoral districts has developed in two different situations. Cadres in the Qianyang electoral district led by example, were selfless, and correctly implemented the Party and government's policies. Therefore, grain supply was reasonable, and the farmers' mood was very good. Cadres in the Datang electoral district took the lead in shouting "not enough to eat," practiced favoritism and shielded others, resulting in unstable public sentiment and chaotic unified sales.

　　Geng Keming, the director of the Datang electoral district, had 420 jin of surplus grain that he did not sell last year. However, in February of this year, he shouted, "Too much grain has been sold, not enough to eat," and ordered a grain purchase plan of 340 jin for two months. Was he really short of food? No. One can see at a glance from the amount of grain currently stored in his home. At present, his family has six dou of glutinous rice and five shi of indica rice, and the rice milled for the Spring Festival has not yet been finished. According to the calculation of stored grain, his grain will last until the new wheat is on the market and still have a surplus. However, he ordered a grain purchase plan for himself and helped his uncles, Geng Xianjin and Geng Xianru, to order grain purchase plans as well (in reality, these two families do not need supplies). This aroused suspicion and anxiety among the farmers, and many people followed Director Geng's example. Yu Xiuying had 140 jin of surplus grain unsold last year. Seeing that Geng Keming had ordered a grain purchase plan, she asked the cadres for grain purchase certificates more than ten times in a row. Geng Keming initially explained the rationale of reasonable supply to the farmers, but because he himself could not stand upright, the masses did not believe what he said. The farmer Dai Yongtao questioned him: "It is unreasonable to supply grain to several of your uncles!" Later, Zhang Shiyin, the branch secretary, patiently educated these farmers about the policy of unified grain purchase and sale. Only two households needed some supplies until May, and the remaining thirteen households did not need any supplies.

　　The situation in the Qianyang electoral district was completely different. Zhou Jiaquan, the director of the electoral district, took the lead in selling more than 1,500 jin of surplus grain during last year's unified purchase, and his current food ration is not much. He has been educated by the Party and understands that in order to implement the unified sales policy well, he must first treat the unified sales work with a sense of ownership, neither exaggerating the grain shortage situation to superiors nor issuing supply certificates indiscriminately. He carefully calculated and arranged his life reasonably, so he did not need the state to supply grain. When middle peasants Zhang Shihai and Yang Youwei shouted that they were "short of food for a month," Zhou Jiaquan knew that they were not short of food. They were shouting this because they were afraid of "adjustment between surpluses and deficiencies." So he carefully explained the policy to them, explaining that after the unified grain purchase was over, the grain retained by the farmers was entirely at their own disposal. They could trade freely in the grain market under the leadership of the state, or they could consume or store it themselves for disaster preparedness, and no one could interfere or force adjustments. They understood the policy, relaxed their minds, and did not want any supplies. Zhou Jiaquan was familiar with the local situation and could educate the farmers with confidence, so the grain supply situation in the entire electoral district was very reasonable.

　　Why are there two completely different situations in the same township? Is there a phenomenon of the unified purchase and sale being too tight or too loose? No. Looking at the situation of unified purchase and sale last year, the amount of grain purchased in the Datang electoral district was less than that in the Qianyang electoral district. In terms of unified sales, the grain retained by the farmers in both electoral districts was slightly higher than the local consumption standard, and the average amount of seeds and food retained by farmers in the Datang electoral district was even eight jin more than in the Qianyang electoral district.

　　Basic-level cadres are the specific implementers of the state's grain policy, and the broad masses of farmers take their actions as an example. They are most familiar with the local situation and live with the masses. As long as they can lead by example, correctly implement the policy, and patiently educate the masses, they will definitely be able to do a good job in unified sales.

### 基层干部要在粮食统销工作中以身作则

　　基层干部要在粮食统销工作中以身作则
　　中共六合县委副书记　刘济川
    最近我在南圩区检查粮食统销工作，感到教育基层干部以身作则正确执行党和政府的政策，是做好这个工作的重要条件。南圩区长岗乡大塘、前杨两个选区的基层干部有两种思想作风，统销工作在这两个选区就发生了两种不同情况。前杨选区干部以身作则，大公无私，正确贯彻了党和政府的政策，因此粮食供应合理，农民情绪很好；大塘选区干部带头喊“不够吃”，徇私包庇，结果，群众情绪不稳定，统销情况很混乱。
    大塘选区主任耿克明去年统购时有四百二十斤余粮没有卖；但今年二月份他就叫喊“粮食卖过头，不够吃”，并订了两个月购买三百四十斤的购粮计划。他是不是真的不够吃呢？不是的。从他家现有存粮来看就能一目了然。目下他家还有六斗糯米、五石籼稻，过春节碾的米到现在还没有吃完。照存粮计算，他的粮食吃到新麦上场还有余。但他自己订了购粮计划，又帮助他的伯叔耿先进、耿先如也订了购粮计划（实际上这两家也不需要供应）。这就引起了农民的怀疑和不安，许多人都向耿主任学。余秀英去年有一百四十斤余粮没卖出，看见耿克明订了购粮计划，她也一连十几次向干部要购粮证。耿克明开始也向农民讲些合理供应的道理；但因自己直不起腰，说话群众不相信。农民戴永涛责问他：“你家叔伯几个都供应，才不合理呢！”后来，支部书记张世银对这些农民耐心地进行了粮食统购统销政策的教育，只有两户到五月份需要供应一些，其余十三户都不要供应了。
    前杨选区的情况就完全不同了。选区主任周家全去年统购中带头卖出余粮一千五百多斤，现有口粮不多。他受到党的教育，懂得要想执行好统销政策，自己首先要以主人翁的态度对待统销工作，不向上夸大缺粮情况，也不乱开供应证。他精打细算，合理地安排自己的生活，就不要国家供应粮食了。中农张世海、杨有为喊“缺一个月吃粮”，周家全知道他们并不缺粮，这样喊是因为怕“有无调剂”，便向他们仔细解释政策，说明粮食统购结束后，农民所留的粮食完全由本人自由处理，可以在国家领导的粮食市场上自由交易，也可以自己食用或储存备荒，任何人不得干涉，不得强迫调剂。他们懂得政策，就放宽了心，也不要供应了。周家全熟悉当地的情况，又能理直气壮地教育农民，因此，全选区粮食供应状况很合理。
    在同一个乡里，为什么会有两种截然不同的情况呢？是不是统购统销有偏紧偏松的现象呢？不是的。从去年统购统销的情况看来，大塘选区粮食统购数比前杨选区要少，在统销方面，这两个选区农民所留的吃粮都略高于当地的消费标准，大塘选区农民所留的种子、吃粮的平均数还比前杨选区多八斤。
    基层干部是国家粮食政策的具体执行者，广大农民群众都以他们的行动为表率。他们最熟悉当地的情况，和群众生活在一起，只要他们能够以身作则，正确地贯彻政策，耐心地教育群众，就一定能够做好统销工作。
