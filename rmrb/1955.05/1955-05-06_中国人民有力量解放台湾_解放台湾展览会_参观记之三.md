　　The Chinese People Have the Strength to Liberate Taiwan
　　——Notes from a Visit to the "Liberate Taiwan Exhibition" (Part 3)
　　By Our Correspondent Lian Yunshan

　　The "Liberate Taiwan Exhibition" uses abundant facts to show people that although the American aggressor group barbarously occupies our Taiwan and constantly uses threats like "atomic war" and "massive retaliation" to threaten our people and obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, they cannot shake the Chinese people's firm will to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands. Many pictures in the exhibition fully demonstrate this will of the 600 million Chinese people and at the same time show that our people have the full strength to liberate Taiwan.
　　Entering the exhibition's courtyard, people are immediately greeted by the wreckage of American-made Chiang planes shot down by our army, cannons captured by our army, and planes flown back to the motherland by insurgent Chiang army officers and soldiers. All of this makes people feel that our national defense strength is growing rapidly.
　　The exhibits inside tell people that in 1949, after driving the evil Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique out of the mainland, the Chinese people immediately launched a struggle to liberate the coastal islands. In the same year, the People's Liberation Army liberated Nantian and Gaotang Islands in Zhejiang, and Xiamen Island and Gulangyu Island in Fujian, and Longxue and Qiao Islands in Guangdong. In 1950, it liberated Zhoushan Islands and Shengsi Islands and other nine islands in Zhejiang, Dongshan Island and Chuanshi Island in Fujian, and Hainan Island and Wanshan Islands and other six islands in Guangdong. From 1951 to 1954, it also liberated Yuanyuan Sha and Sheshan Islands in Jiangsu, Pingtou Mountain, Jigu Mountain, Toumen Island, and Taishan Islands in Zhejiang, Fuyao Island and Xiyang, Fuying and other islands in Fujian, and Nanpai Islands in Guangdong.
　　To liberate the coastal islands and Taiwan, to save the compatriots in Taiwan and the coastal islands who are living a painful life under the rule of the American Chiang regime, to defend the security of the motherland's mainland, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has made active efforts in all aspects in recent years to rapidly build itself into a modern national defense force. The exhibition's pictures and objects tell people that the People's Liberation Army is now a modern land, sea, and air force composed of an air force with various attack aircraft, fighter jets, bombers, and various jet planes, a navy with various cruisers and escort ships, and various artillery units, tank units, and infantry. The various branches of the People's Liberation Army are working closely together, vigilantly guarding the coast and borders of the motherland day and night, protecting the security of the motherland and its construction.
　　In July 1953, under the direction of American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique pieced together more than 10,000 land, sea, and air forces, attempting to seize Dongshan Island as a stronghold for "counterattacking the mainland." This invasion was carried out after a long period of preparation and planning and after being personally trained by American advisors in amphibious landings and all other actions. This was the largest harassment of the mainland by the Chiang bandits in recent years. However, after the heroic counterattack by the People's Liberation Army's island garrison, the enemy's conspiracy was completely shattered, and more than 3,700 Chiang bandit troops were annihilated and fled in panic. Among the exhibits in the exhibition are the heroic postures of the People's Liberation Army fiercely counterattacking the invading Chiang bandit troops, the kitchen knife used by farmer Lin Dafu to seize a Chiang bandit paratrooper machine gun, and the deeds of the famous Dongshan Seven Youths. On a red piece of paper, the Dongshan youths wrote the people's just voice and demands in crooked characters with a brush: Chiang army officers and soldiers, you have come to Dongshan, the people do not need you, and the people of the whole country do not want you, you should get out of here quickly! This should be a powerful warning to the enemy.
　　The exhibition displays photos of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit that shot down or damaged twelve American-made Chiang planes in nine days and nights of fierce fighting, as well as photos of the People's Air Force fiercely bombing Dachen Port, destroying and damaging American-made Chiang bandit warships. A photo of a Chiang bandit's "Zhong" class landing ship burning fiercely after being hit is also on display here.
　　In November 1954, the People's Navy's torpedo boat unit sank the Chiang bandit's "Taiping" escort destroyer and "Dongting" gunboat. These two warships were both given to the Chiang bandits by the United States and were also the main ships of the Chiang bandit navy. Large oil paintings and photos in the exhibition record the circumstances of the heroic People's Navy sinking these two warships. This shows that the strength of our People's Liberation Army in air defense and aerial combat is rapidly developing, and at the same time shows that the strength of our People's Navy is rapidly growing. After the Taiping warship was sunk, Washington in the United States had to admit that "China now possesses a strong naval force."
　　A large sand table uses electrical schematic to record the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Yijiangshan Island. Here, one can see the modern scale of the People's Liberation Army's maritime operations. At the scheduled time, the People's Liberation Army's powerful artillery first bombarded Yijiangshan Island across the sea; then, air force planes flew to Yijiangshan Island and poured down bombs, destroying the enemy's defensive fortifications; at the same time, the naval fleet also sailed towards Yijiangshan Island, braving the wind and waves. Under the cover of air force and warship artillery fire, the infantry landed and launched a courageous attack on the enemy entrenched in the remaining bunkers. In less than two hours, the entire island was liberated. At this time, the electrical schematic diagram showed a red flag rising on the main peak of Yijiangshan Island. That red flag is now also on display in the exhibition hall.
　　The liberation of Yijiangshan Island shows that the People's Liberation Army's ability to conduct modern joint operations of land, sea, and air forces is rapidly developing and improving.
　　After the liberation of Yijiangshan Island, the Chiang bandit troops entrenched in Dachen and its surrounding islands were exposed to the serious threat of our army, and they faced only two paths: surrender or complete annihilation. Therefore, the American imperialists had to gather a large number of naval and air forces to directly cover the hasty retreat of the Chiang bandit troops from the Dachen Islands. The photos displayed in the exhibition show that the Chiang bandit troops' retreat was very embarrassing, and they did not even have time to take away secret documents and military supplies. In less than half a month after that, all the islands along the coast of Zhejiang were liberated.
　　The broad masses of people actively participated in the People's Liberation Army's struggle against the enemy.
　　The exhibition displays many photos of the masses supporting the front lines. Here, people can see photos of "Mom of Coastal Defense Soldiers" Liu Xing and the little girl Fang Yahua, who performed meritorious service in sheltering the wounded.
　　In a glass cabinet is displayed a letter to Chiang army officers and soldiers written by Chen Shiyan, a former Kuomintang army officer captured by our army, which describes the participation of the people of Dongshan Island in the Dongshan battle: In the fierce battle, the men and women, old and young of Dongshan voluntarily delivered food and water to the People's Liberation Army; some even picked up guns found on the battlefield and shot at the enemy together with the People's Liberation Army; Chiang bandit paratroopers who landed in the rice fields were surrounded by militiamen and the people, killed or taken prisoner.
　　Not only during wartime, but even in peacetime, the fishermen and farmers along the coast did not forget their most important task while fishing at sea or farming in the fields: closely monitoring the enemy's activities. This "net of heaven and earth" formed by the army and the people to capture the enemy constantly caught American and Chiang secret agents trying to sneak into our mainland.
　　The exhibition includes photos of militiamen from Dongpu Village, Datian County, Fujian, encircling and suppressing a group of airborne agents, and photos of Cai Akai, Zhang Xiexun, and Ye Da Niang, fishermen from Tongpan Island, Zhejiang, who bravely and intelligently captured two agents... Among these photos is one: Behind the reeds on the seashore stand two young fishermen, vigilantly observing the movements on the sea. These are the famous spy-catching experts Hong Shunli and his militia partners. They once used large iron hooks for catching sharks to catch two secret agents. The militia of Dengdong Township, Dadeng District, Nan'an County, Fujian, captured fourteen American and Chiang secret agents in more than five years.
　　To support the liberation of Taiwan, factories and rural areas across the country launched enthusiastic labor emulation and production increase campaigns. New records and new products are constantly appearing in factories; many new achievements have also been made on the agricultural front. Many charts and photos in the exhibition powerfully inspire people to move forward.
　　The islands waiting to be liberated now are only Mazu, Wuqiu, Kinmen, Dongyin, Baiken, Dongding, Penghu and Taiwan. These islands, like Zhoushan, Dachen, Xiamen, and Hainan, are all inseparable parts of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China, and they are indispensable barriers to the security of our motherland. The Chinese people are determined to continue to liberate these islands and have the strength to liberate them.
　　However, victory cannot be easily obtained. We must continue to strengthen the struggle to liberate Taiwan. In the last painting of the exhibition, a giant is drawn, his hand pointing at the audience, seriously asking people:
　　"What are you doing to liberate Taiwan?"
　　Indeed, the people of New China should examine their activities with this sentence every day, so that they can make more and more valuable contributions in the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

　　中国人民有力量解放台湾
　　——“解放台湾展览会”参观记之三
　　本报记者　连云山
    “解放台湾展览会”用丰富的事实给人们指明：尽管美国侵略集团野蛮地侵占了我们的台湾，并且不断地用“原子战争”和“大规模报复”之类的恐吓来威胁我国人民，阻挠中国人民解放台湾，但是他们丝毫不能动摇中国人民消灭蒋介石卖国集团、解放台湾和沿海岛屿的坚定意志。展览会上的许多图片，充分地表明了六万万中国人民的这种意志，同时表明了我国人民完全有解放台湾的力量。
    走进展览会的大院，人们迎面就可以看到被我军击毁的美制蒋机的残骸，被我军缴获的大炮，还有起义的蒋军官兵驾着飞返祖国的飞机。所有这些，都使人们感觉到我国的国防力量在迅速地成长。
    屋内的展品告诉人们：一九四九年中国人民在把万恶的蒋介石卖国集团赶出大陆以后，紧接着就展开了解放沿海岛屿的斗争。同一年，人民解放军解放了浙江的南田和高塘岛，在福建又解放了厦门岛和鼓浪屿等岛，在广东则解放了龙穴和淇澳岛。一九五○年在浙江方面又解放了舟山群岛和嵊泗列岛等九个岛屿，在福建方面解放了东山岛和川石岛，在广东方面解放了海南岛和万山群岛等六个岛屿。一九五一年到一九五四年，又在江苏方面解放了圆圆沙、佘山等岛屿，在浙江方面解放了平头山、积谷山、头门岛和台山列岛，在福建方面解放了福瑶岛和西洋、浮鹰等岛，在广东方面解放了南湃群岛。
    为了解放沿海岛屿和台湾，拯救在美蒋统治下过着痛苦生活的台湾和沿海岛屿的同胞，为了保卫祖国大陆的安全，保卫远东和世界和平，几年来中国人民解放军积极从各方面努力，把自己迅速地建设成为现代化的国防力量。展览会的图片和实物告诉人们，人民解放军现在已经是由具有各式强击机、歼击机、轰炸机和各式喷气飞机的空军，由具有各种巡洋舰和卫护舰的海军以及各种炮兵部队、坦克部队和步兵组成的近代化陆海空军力量。人民解放军各兵种正密切配合，日日夜夜警惕地守卫着祖国的海岸和边疆，保卫着祖国的安全和建设事业。
    一九五三年七月，在美帝国主义的指使下，蒋介石卖国集团拼凑了陆海空军一万多人，企图夺取东山岛，作为“反攻大陆”的据点。这次进犯经过长期的准备和策划，并且是由美国顾问亲自训练了两栖登陆等一切行动后进行的。这是蒋贼几年来骚扰大陆规模最大的一次。但是，经过人民解放军守岛部队的英勇反击，敌人的阴谋被彻底粉碎了，蒋贼军被歼灭了三千七百多人，狼狈溃逃。展览会的展品中，有人民解放军向进犯的蒋贼军猛烈反击的雄姿，也有农民林大富夺取蒋贼伞兵机枪时用的菜刀，还有著名的东山七少年的斗争事迹。在一张红纸上，东山少年用毛笔歪歪扭扭地写出人民的正义呼声和要求：蒋军官兵们，你们来到东山，人民不需要你们，全国人民也不要你们，你们赶快滚出去吧！这对于敌人应该是一个有力的警告。
    展览会展出了曾经在九天九夜的激战中击落击伤美制蒋机十二架的某高射炮部队的照片，也陈列着人民空军猛烈轰炸大陈港、炸毁炸伤美制蒋贼军舰的照片。被炸中后正在猛烈燃烧的蒋贼中字号登陆舰的照片也陈列在这里。
      一九五四年十一月，人民海军的鱼雷快艇部队曾经先后击沉了蒋贼的“太平号”护航驱逐舰和
  “洞庭号”炮舰，这两艘军舰都是美国送给蒋贼的，也是蒋贼海军的主力舰只。展览会的大幅油画和照片，记录了英勇的人民海军击沉这两艘军舰时的情形。这里表明我国人民解放军在防空和空中作战方面的力量在迅速发展，同时也显示出我国人民海军的力量在迅速增长。太平号军舰被击沉以后，美国华盛顿方面也只得承认“中国现在拥有强大的海军力量。”
    有一个大沙盘用电动示意记载了人民解放军解放一江山岛的情形，在这里可以看到人民解放军海上作战的近代化规模。在预定的时刻里，人民解放军强大的炮兵首先向一江山岛隔海轰击；接着，空军机群飞向一江山岛倾泻着炸弹，摧毁敌人的防御工事；同时，海军舰队也乘风破浪驶向一江山岛。在空军和军舰炮火的掩护下，步兵登陆了，他们向钻在残存碉堡里的敌人发起了勇猛攻击。不到两小时，这个海岛就全部解放了。这时，电动示意图显示出一面红旗，升上一江山岛的主峰。那面红旗现在也陈列在展览室里。
    一江山岛的解放，表明了人民解放军进行现代陆海空军联合作战的能力在迅速发展和提高。
    一江山岛解放以后，盘据在大陈及其外围岛屿的蒋贼军被暴露在我军的严重威胁下，他们面临的道路只有两条，一条是投降，一条是全军覆灭。因此，美帝国主义者不得不集结了大量海空军，直接掩护大陈各岛蒋贼军仓皇撤逃。展览会陈列的照片表明，蒋贼军的撤逃是十分狼狈的，他们甚至连秘密文件和军火物资也来不及带走。此后不到半个月，整个浙江沿海的岛屿全部解放。
    广大人民群众积极参加了人民解放军的对敌斗争。
    展览会展出了许多群众支援前线的照片。人们在这里可以看到“海防战士的妈妈”刘杏和掩护伤员立功的小姑娘方亚花的像片。
    玻璃橱里摆着的一份被我军俘掳的原国民党军官陈士彦写的告蒋军官兵书，里面这样叙述东山岛人民参加东山战斗的情况：在激烈的战斗里，东山的男女老百姓，都自动给解放军送饭送水；有的竟拿起了在战场上拾到的枪杆和解放军一起向敌人射击；降落在稻田里的蒋贼军伞兵，有的就被民兵和老百姓包围起来，击毙或当了俘虏。
    不但战时这样，就是平时，沿海的渔民和农民在海上捕鱼或者在田里种地的时候，都没有忘掉自己有一个最重要的任务：密切地监视着敌人的活动。这个由军民结成的捕捉敌人的“天罗地网”，不断捉住了企图潜入我国大陆的美蒋特务。
    展览会里有福建大田县东浦村民兵围剿一股空降特务的照片，有浙江铜盘岛渔民蔡阿楷、张协纯等和一位叶大娘英勇机智地捕捉了两个特务的照片……在这些照片中间有这样一张：在海边的芦苇后面，站着两位年青的渔民，他们警惕地观察着海面上的动静。这就是有名的抓特务能手洪顺利和他的民兵伙伴。他们曾用捉大鲨鱼的大铁钩捉了两个特务。福建南安县大嶝区嶝东乡民兵，五年多捉住十四个美蒋特务。
    为了支援解放台湾，全国各地工厂和农村开展了火热的劳动竞赛和增产竞赛。工厂方面在不断地出现新纪录、新产品；农业战线上也取得许多新的成就。展览会中的许多图表和照片，有力地激励着人们前进。
    正待解放的岛屿，现在就剩下马祖、乌丘、金门、东引，白犬、东碇，澎湖和台湾了。这些岛屿和舟山、大陈、厦门、海南一样，都是中华人民共和国神圣领土不可分割的部分，都是我们祖国安全的不可缺少的屏障。中国人民决心继续解放这些岛屿，也有力量解放它们。
    但是，胜利不是轻易能够得来的。我们还必须继续加强解放台湾的斗争。展览会在最后一幅图画上，画着一个巨人，他的手指向观众，严肃地向人们问道：
    “你为解放台湾做些什么？”
    的确，新中国人民都应该每天拿这句话来检查一下自己的活动，使自己在解放台湾的斗争中做出更多的和更有价值的工作。
