Eradicating the Hidden "Underground Army"
　　Wang Zhenzhi
    The disclosure of the two batches of materials concerning the Hu Feng anti-Party clique reveals the crimes committed by Hu Feng himself, written by his own devilish hands. Hu Feng can no longer escape the people's net of justice, and we must thoroughly eradicate this hidden "underground army"!
    Hu Feng, this vicious leader of the "underground army," was determined to "cut off my head and throw it out when I see the right time." He vowed to "make them know that it is not easy for the world to be 'peaceful'." In order to fundamentally shake the Party's leadership, he used the most vicious "Sun Wukong enters the stomach" tactic, dispatching his cronies to infiltrate every corner of the revolutionary camp. They infiltrated the literary leading organs, organizations, publishing houses, newspapers, and schools in many regions such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Wuhan. He even more frantically and shamelessly made his cronies infiltrate the Party to engage in conspiratorial activities. He wanted his cronies to "collect some materials" for him, instructed them to impersonate "the masses" to make "protests," send letters to the "Literary Gazette," and after tricking them into replying, he then instructed: "Write a letter to him in the tone of the first communication" to serve as his capital for "attacking" and "proving" things. Some people acted as his messengers, deploying tasks everywhere and transmitting messages. Even in order to plan conspiracies, Hu Feng did not hesitate to "raise travel expenses from here," mobilizing his cronies to receive face-to-face instructions. Some people then usurped the leading positions in the Party's propaganda and publishing work, expanding the strength of Hu Feng's "underground army" and sheltering his hidden cronies. Even more, some shameless traitors like Lu Dian specialized in stealing and transcribing Party documents for his leader Hu Feng to "sharpen my sword and survey the direction." Hu Feng himself, on the one hand, instructed and planned all these conspiracies, and on the other hand, posed as a hero ready to conquer the world, waiting for "more materials, or for me to come forward myself, then they cannot but publish it," dreaming of seizing "a gap" to "shatter" the revolutionary literary front. Hu Feng's conspiracy did not succeed, and Hu Feng's crimes are continuing to be exposed. We will never give up until we thoroughly eradicate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group!

　　剿灭隐蔽的“地下军”
　　王震之
    两批关于胡风反党集团的材料披露了，这是由胡风的一双魔手亲笔写的他所干的罪行。胡风是再也逃脱不掉人民的法网了，我们必须把这支隐蔽的
  “地下军”彻底剿灭！
    胡风，这个“地下军”凶恶的头子，他是决心
  “到我看准了的时候，我愿意割下我的头颅抛掷出去”的。他发誓要“使他们知道天下不容易‘太平’”。他为了从根本上动摇党的领导，他使用了最毒辣的“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，派遣他的党羽钻进革命阵营的各个角落里去。他们打入了北京、天津、上海、杭州、武汉等许多地区的文艺领导机关、团体、出版社、报社和学校里去，他更疯狂无耻地使他的党羽打进党内，干阴谋勾当。他要他的党羽为他“收集一些材料”，指示他们冒充“群众”进行“抗议”，向“文艺报”寄信，等骗到回信之后，他又指令：“用初次通信的口气”写一封信给他，作为他“打击”和“证明”的资本。有的人为他做信使，到处布置任务，传递消息。甚至为了策划阴谋，胡风不惜“旅费由这里筹措”，调动他的党羽来面授机宜。有的人则窃居党的宣传、出版工作的领导岗位，为胡风“地下军”扩充实力，包庇隐蔽他的党羽。更有一些如芦甸这种无耻的叛徒，竟专门担负着盗窃、传抄党内文件的任务，供他的头子胡风“磨我的剑，窥测方向”。而胡风自己则一面指示着，策划着这一切阴谋，一面却摆出了英雄好汉的架势包打江山，等着“材料多了，或者我自己出面，那他们是不能不登的罢”，梦想着抓到“一个缺口”，把革命的文艺阵线“击碎”。胡风的阴谋并未得逞，胡风的罪行在继续揭露，我们不彻底剿灭胡风反革命集团决不罢休！
