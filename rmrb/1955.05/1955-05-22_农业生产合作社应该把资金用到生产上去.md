To the Editor:

　　One bright spring afternoon, I visited Weiting Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sanle Township, Area One, Huanjiang County, Guangxi.

　　At that time, it was the season of spring plowing, and the surrounding agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams were working enthusiastically on accumulating fertilizer and repairing water conservancy facilities. However, the members of Weiting Cooperative were busy repairing house foundations and transporting wood. It turned out that a row of five spacious houses was being built in the center of the village. The front was built with red bricks, with steps in front of the door, and glass windows and smooth eaves were about to be installed. This building about to be completed is the meeting room of the Weiting Agricultural Production Cooperative.

　　The cooperative originally had a public accumulation fund and public welfare fund of 899.40 yuan, while the construction cost of the meeting room was 1,674 yuan. In this way, the little public property that the cooperative had just accumulated was used up, and it was also in debt. Last year, the cooperative borrowed 880 yuan from the state bank, and has not repaid any of it to this day. The cooperative originally planned to buy 2,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, but now it has to change it to 400 jin. The original plan of the entire cooperative to accumulate 740,000 jin of fertilizer only reached 540,000 jin by the beginning of April; a ditch was not repaired until late March; after the dry seedlings were sown, they were not covered with grass, and the seeds were left in the ground to be eaten by birds and rodents; and they were not watered during the drought, and the sprouts had not emerged eight days after sowing. One-third of the eight acres of corn planted were missing seedlings.

　　Why did the Weiting Agricultural Production Cooperative put aside agricultural production to build this house? According to the cadres of the cooperative: "This year during the Spring Festival, the worker comrades came to the cooperative to celebrate, and there was no good place for meetings; it is too undignified to hold meetings in the open air!" In fact, in the hall of a cooperative member's house opposite the new house, it can accommodate fifty or sixty people, which was the original place for meetings and office work, and it was enough for holding cooperative member meetings in the past. Besides, how many times a year can there be such a party to entertain a large number of guests? Some cadres also emphasized that building this house is not only for meetings, but also to use two rooms as warehouses. In fact, the Tanglan Agricultural Production Cooperative, not far from Weiting Cooperative, has even more households, but they do not have a warehouse, and they still do a good job of grain storage. I believe that this wasteful phenomenon of Weiting Cooperative neglecting production and spending money on unnecessary public buildings should attract the attention of rural workers.

### 农业生产合作社应该把资金用到生产上去

　　农业生产合作社应该把资金用到生产上去编辑同志：
    在一个春光明媚的下午，我曾到广西环江县一区三乐乡伟庭农业生产合作社参观。
    这时，正是春耕生产季节，周围的农业生产合作社和互助组正在热火朝天地进行积肥、修水利。而伟庭社的社员们却在忙着修整房基，搬运木材。原来这个村子的中心正盖着一排五间的宽敞房屋。正面砌的是一色红砖，门前有台阶，玻璃窗和平滑的檐板快装上去了。这座即将落成的建筑，就是伟庭农业生产合作社的会议室。
    这个社原有公积金、公益金八百九十九元四角，而会议室的建筑费就花去了一千六百七十四元，这样，社里刚刚积累起来的一点公共财产就用得空空的，并且还负了债。去年社里向国家银行贷款八百八十元，到现在一点也没有还。社里原来计划买化学肥料二千斤，现在只好改为四百斤，全社原定积肥七十四万斤的计划，到四月初才积了五十四万斤；一条水沟到三月下旬也没修；旱秧播种后没盖草，种籽在地里任随鸟食鼠啮；天气干旱也不浇水，播种八天还未出芽。种了八亩玉米，缺苗的就有三分之一。
    为什么伟庭农业生产合作社放下农业生产来修建这座房子呢？据这个社的干部说：“今年春节，工人老大哥来社里联欢，开会都没个好地方；在露天里开会，太不像样了！”其实，就在新房子对面一家社员的厅堂里，可以容纳五、六十人，是原来开会和办公的地方，过去，开社员大会也够用了。再说，像这样招待大批客人的联欢会一年又能有几次？有的干部还强调盖这房子不单为了开会，还用两间作仓库。其实，和伟庭社相距不远的塘兰农业生产合作社户数还要多，他们没有仓库，一样把粮食保管工作做好了。我认为伟庭社这种忽视生产把钱花在不必要的公共建筑上的浪费现象，应该引起农村工作者的注意。　广西读者　韦浦昌
