　　Improve Livestock Feeding Management in Agricultural Cooperatives
　　Zhao Zonghui
    Recently, the phenomenon of livestock becoming thin and dying in agricultural production cooperatives is still occurring frequently in many areas. According to preliminary statistics from 347 cooperatives in Lushan County, Henan Province, 673 livestock have died since the end of last winter, accounting for one-tenth of the total number of draft animals in these cooperatives. In 25 of these cooperatives, more than five livestock died. In the Sanxiangou Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Eighth District, 11 out of 29 cattle died; recently, another four were sold because the cattle were thin. The thinness of draft animals is a common phenomenon. The draft cattle of a cooperative in Sunzhuang Township, Eleventh District, were so thin that they were just skeletons, and later the members pulled them to the beef market and sold them. The large number of deaths and thinness of draft cattle not only directly hinders current production (many cooperatives' spring plowing plans lag behind mutual aid groups and individual farmers due to too many livestock deaths), but also has a very bad impact among the masses inside and outside the cooperative. People who were originally very enthusiastic about the cause of agricultural cooperatives are greatly disappointed. Some ideologically unstable members are even more shaken when they see this situation. When the masses outside the cooperative see this situation, they are becoming more and more alienated from agricultural cooperatives. Some members, fearing that their cattle would die, argued with the cooperative cadres and took the cattle home to feed them themselves. Certain wealthy households satirize the situation everywhere, while class enemies take the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage.
    According to investigation, the reasons for the large number of livestock becoming thin and dying in agricultural production cooperatives are: first, the lack of a system for collective feeding and use. The leading cadres in the cooperative do not have a clear division of labor, no one is assigned to be responsible, the people who feed the livestock are not fixed, and there is no fixed plan or system for feeding and using the livestock. For example, four of the five cattle sheds in the Sanxiangou Agricultural Production Cooperative were unattended; the cooperative did not even know that the cattle had frozen to death at night. In the agricultural production cooperative led by Wang Chengzhou in the First District, people were temporarily assigned to feed the cattle, and whoever fed them would just add a handful of grass. Second, there is a lack of collectivist ideological education for the members. Everyone抢 (qiang, to rush to) use the large livestock, while no one cares about the small livestock; some members, in order to earn more work points, only care about using them and do not care about feeding them. Sometimes, the cattle are taken to work before they are full, and they are not allowed to rest during use, and they are beaten hard, causing the livestock to be overworked or injured. Zhao Baofa, a member of the Licun Cooperative in Xinjixiang Township, beat the cow on the head with several kilograms of iron farming tools because the cow was pulling slowly, causing the cow's mouth to bleed. Third, the regulations on labor remuneration for feeders are unreasonable. Most cooperatives have fixed points and fixed calculations. Some cooperatives have set the work points for feeders too low, and the feeders feel that feeding livestock is not as good as doing other work; some cooperatives have set the work points for feeders too high, and other members are dissatisfied with the feeders, which also reduces the feeders' interest in feeding livestock. Fourth, the selection of feeders is inappropriate, and there is a lack of ideological education. Many cooperative feeders are ideologically conservative and backward, only care about their personal interests, and do not care about the public property of the cooperative. According to statistics, among the 943 feeders, only 9 are Communist Party members and 48 are Communist Youth League members, and most of them are ideologically backward. The cooperatives rarely pay attention to educating the feeders. Yang Dani, a feeder in the Guandimiao Cooperative in the First District, is over sixty years old this year. Since 1947, she has hardly attended a meeting in the past eight years. Many feeders feel that being a "cowherd" is not promising, the work is hard and dirty, and they are looked down upon and unwilling to do it. In this way, of course, the livestock cannot be fed well. Some cooperatives also let some people who lack feeding experience feed the cattle in order to take care of semi-laborers, which causes the cattle to become thin or die. An individual cooperative even let a rich peasant who had joined the cooperative or someone with a problematic history be a feeder. Fifth, the cooperative lacks forage. The main reason for this problem is that the livestock were blindly priced and returned to the cooperative, and there were no reasonable regulations on forage investment methods after they were returned. Some cooperatives' cattle are not full, and the members sell their own forage outside the cooperative instead. Sixth, class enemies sabotage. Needles, knives, stones, iron pieces, iron wires, etc. were found in the stomachs of several dead draft cattle in the Xiaojianying Cooperative.
    Can these phenomena be prevented? Facts have proved that it is entirely possible. Some cooperatives have already created some experiences. Some cooperatives, in response to the ideology shown by members in managing and raising livestock, have repeatedly educated them on collectivist ideology, explaining that protecting livestock is the greatest interest of the entire cooperative and their individuals, and mobilizing them to jointly find ways to overcome the difficulties in livestock feeding management, do a good job in livestock management, establish a set of organizations and systems for managing draft animals, and make reasonable regulations on the labor remuneration of feeders and the methods for members to invest in forage. Some townships in the Eighth District of Lushan County hold monthly livestock health competitions, and the Sangpan Township Cooperative in the Seventh District implements a "quota reward system" for feeding work, which has played a significant role in improving feeding work. The Lushan County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a county-wide representative conference of model feeders of agricultural production cooperatives, widely exchanged experiences in strengthening feeding management, conducted political and ideological education for feeders, commended and rewarded model feeders, and helped cooperatives formulate and improve feeding systems. Prior to this, all cooperatives launched a campaign to elect model feeders. An atmosphere of honor in being a feeder has begun to form throughout the county. In order to quickly stop the phenomenon of livestock becoming thin and dying, the county committee also instructed all localities to regard strengthening livestock feeding management as one of the important tasks in rectifying and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives at present.

### 改进农业合作社的牲畜饲养管理工作

　　改进农业合作社的牲畜饲养管理工作
　　赵宗惠
    最近，不少地区农业生产合作社牲畜瘦弱死亡的现象还在不断地发生。据河南省鲁山县三百四十七个社的初步统计，自去年冬末到现在，就死去了六百七十三头牲口，占这些社的耕畜总数的十分之一。其中有二十五个社牲畜死亡都在五头以上。八区三先沟农业生产合作社的二十九头牛就死了十一头；最近因为牛瘦，又卖掉四头。耕畜瘦弱是普遍的现象。十一区孙庄乡的一个社的耕牛，瘦得成了骨头架子，后来社员就把它们拉到牛肉行里卖掉了。耕牛的大量死亡和瘦弱，不仅直接妨碍了当前的生产（有不少社因牲畜死亡太多，春耕计划落到了互助组和单干农民后边），并且在社内外群众当中发生了极坏的影响。原来很热心农业合作社事业的人，大大地失望了。有些思想不稳定的社员，看到这种情况，更加动摇了。社外群众看到这种情况，对农业合作社也越来越疏远了。有的社员怕自己的牛死掉，就和社干部吵架，把牛拉回家自己喂。某些富裕户到处讽刺，阶级敌人则乘机大肆造谣破坏。
    据考察，农业生产合作社牲畜的大量瘦弱和死亡的原因是：第一、缺乏集体饲养和使用的制度。社内领导骨干没有明确分工，没有确定专人负责，饲养牲畜的人也不固定，牲口的喂养和使用都没有一定的计划和制度。如三先沟农业生产合作社的五个牛屋，就有四个牛屋没人管；夜间牛冻死了，社里还没有人知道。一区王承州领导的农业生产合作社喂牛是临时派人，谁喂时添上一把草就了事。第二、对社员缺乏集体主义思想教育。大牲口大家抢着用，小牲口没人管；有些社员为了多赚工分，就只顾使，不顾喂。有时，牛没吃饱就拉走上工了，使用时不歇，狠狠地打，使牲口劳累过度或受伤。辛集乡李村社社员赵宝法，因为牛拉的慢，就用几斤重的铁农具向牛头上打，把牛嘴都打流血了。第三、对饲养员的劳动报酬规定得不合理，多数社是死分死计，有些社把饲养员的工分规定得过低，饲养员感到喂牲畜不如做别的活；有的社饲养员的工分规定得过高，别的社员对饲养员不满，也降低了饲养员饲养牲畜的兴趣。第四、对饲养员的选择不恰当，而且缺乏思想教育。不少社的饲养员思想保守落后，只顾个人利益，不关心社内公共财产。据统计，在九百四十三个饲养员中，只有九个是共产党员、四十八个是青年团员，大多数思想比较落后。各社很少注意对饲养员进行教育。一区关帝庙社饲养员杨大妮，今年六十多岁了，从一九四七年到现在，八年中几乎连一次会议也没有参加过。饲养员中有很多人感到当“牛把”没出息，活苦、活脏，被人瞧不起、不愿干。这样，当然就不能把牲畜喂养好。还有些社为了照顾半劳力，让一些缺乏喂养经验的人喂牛，就把牛喂瘦或喂死了。有个别社还让已入社的富农或历史上有问题的人当饲养员。第五、社内缺乏草料。发生这个问题的主要原因是盲目地把牲口作价归社，归社后又没有合理规定草料投资办法。有些社牛吃不饱，社员反把自己的草料卖给社外。第六、阶级敌人破坏。从小尖营社死的几头耕牛的肚子中，发现了针、小刀、石头、铁片、铁丝等。
    这些现象是不是可以防止呢？事实证明是完全可以的。有些社已经创造了一些经验。有些社针对社员在经营饲养牲畜上表现出来的思想，经常地反复地对他们进行集体主义思想教育，说明保护牲畜是全社和他们个人的最大利益，发动他们共同想法克服牲畜饲养管理的困难，做好了牲畜管理工作，建立了一套管理耕畜的组织和制度，对饲养员劳动报酬和社员用饲草投资的办法都作了合理规定。鲁山县第八区有些乡按月举行了牲畜健康比赛会，第七区桑盘乡社内对饲养工作实行了“定额奖励制”，对改进饲养工作都起了重大的作用。中共鲁山县委最近又召开了全县农业生产合作社模范饲养员代表大会，广泛地交流了加强饲养管理工作的经验，对饲养员进行了政治思想教育，表扬奖励了模范饲养员，帮助各社制定、改进了饲养制度。在这以前，各社都开展了一次评选饲养员模范的运动。在全县各地已经开始形成了当饲养员光荣的空气。为了迅速制止牲畜的瘦弱和死亡现象发生，县委并指示各地把加强牲畜饲养管理工作，当作当前整顿和巩固农业生产合作社当中的重要工作之一。
