　　Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington on May 2nd, American diplomatic officials revealed that "the French government has warned the United States that the growing anti-French propaganda within the Vietnamese army, especially within Ngo Dinh Diem's forces, has created a danger."
    The report stated that France has told American officials in Paris that if this propaganda continues to grow, it will endanger the lives of French army officers who are still serving as instructors in the Vietnamese army. France also pointed out that some incidents have already occurred between Vietnamese and French officers due to this propaganda.
    The report stated that France believes that if this anti-French propaganda affects the safety of French officers and soldiers in Vietnam, "the French forces stationed in Vietnam under the command of General Ely may have to take drastic action."

    消息说，法国已向巴黎的美国官员说，如果这种宣传增长下去，将会危害仍在越南军队中任教官的法国陆军军官的生命，法国并指出，由于这种宣传，已在越南和法国军官间发生了一些事件。
