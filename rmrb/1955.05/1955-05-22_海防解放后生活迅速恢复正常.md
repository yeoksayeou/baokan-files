Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 20th: Life in Haiphong has quickly returned to normal in the week since the city's liberation.

　　The Haiphong Power Plant is not only fully supplying the city with electricity, but is also sending power to Jian'an, Guang'an and other cities. The waterworks increased its water supply hours from the time it was taken over, ensuring that citizens have sufficient water.

　　The Haiphong-Hanoi train, which runs twice daily, has resumed its service and has added more carriages. The postal and telecommunications departments restored all original services three days ago. City telephones are operating smoothly. Mail can now be sent to Hanoi and the northern provinces. Telegraph services are gradually expanding, and direct communication is now possible with Hanoi, Jian'an, and Guang'an, and communication with foreign ports has been maintained.

　　Various parts of the harbor have begun to become active. The takeover cadres and workers worked together to determine the sea routes, measured the water level, and established a new pilot team to replace the French pilots who had withdrawn. The shipyard is repairing abandoned speedboats and vessels. Most of the city's stores have reopened. Since the 15th, all ten-plus city markets have fully recovered. Small-scale industries and handicrafts workshops, which were squeezed out by foreign goods in the past, have also partially resumed production.

　　The prices of grain, vegetables, meat and daily necessities in the market are stable. State-owned trading companies have opened ten grain retail outlets and department stores, and have also set up grain consignment stores to ensure the supply of grain and daily necessities, and further stabilize market prices.

　　The original thirteen public schools in Haiphong City were forced to close long before liberation. On the 18th, three public primary schools have resumed classes. In two or three days, Wuquan Middle School in Haiphong City will also open. The five major hospitals and medical institutions inside and outside the city have also resumed normal operations since the 15th.

　　Three mobile film projection teams from Hanoi have been showing films such as "Dien Bien Phu Victory" in the suburbs, urban areas, and enterprises in recent days. The Vietnam Central Art Troupe is also busy performing for the citizens, and they have been warmly welcomed by the people of Haiphong.
