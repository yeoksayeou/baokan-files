　　Xinjiang Petroleum Company's Coking Plant Goes Into Production
    Xinjiang Petroleum Company's newly built coking plant has been put into operation on May 6th, after a comprehensive trial run proving its good performance. The first batch of coking distillate oil and coke produced are of good quality, and the oil yield meets the design standards.
    The completion of this coking plant enables the Xinjiang Petroleum Company's refining department to have complete equipment for processing crude oil. In the past, a large number of by-products - cracked residual oil - remaining after the cracking plant extracted gasoline, diesel and other products from straight-run residual oil (i.e. black oil) were used as fuel due to the lack of processing equipment. Now, after high-temperature coking of these large quantities of by-products by the coking plant, coking distillate oil can be extracted, and then the coking distillate oil can be sent to the cracking plant as a raw material for extracting gasoline. In this way, the oil yield of crude oil refining gasoline can be increased by six percent. In addition, the coking plant can also refine some coke from cracked residual oil, which is the best fuel for smelting high-grade metals.
    This coking plant was built by Xinjiang Petroleum Company's construction workers under the guidance of Soviet experts, for the first time carrying out outdoor construction in the severe winter. Thanks to the efforts of workers of all ethnic groups in overcoming various difficulties, this coking plant was put into production more than a month ahead of schedule. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 新疆石油公司焦化厂投入生产

　　新疆石油公司焦化厂投入生产
    新疆石油公司新建的一座焦化厂，经全面试车证明运转情况良好，部分机器已在五月六日投入生产。生产出来的第一批焦化馏出油和焦炭质量都很好，出油率达到了设计标准。
    这座焦化厂的建成，使新疆石油公司炼油部门有了处理原油的完整设备。过去裂化厂从直馏渣油（即黑油）中提炼汽油、柴油等产品后所剩的大量副产品——裂化渣油，由于没有处理设备，被当作燃料使用。现在，这些大量的副产品经过焦化厂高温焦化后就可提炼出焦化馏出油，然后再把焦化馏出油送到裂化厂作为提炼汽油的原料。这样，原油提炼汽油的出油率就可以提高百分之六。此外，焦化厂还可以从裂化渣油中炼出一部分焦炭，这种焦炭是冶炼高级金属的最好燃料。
    这座焦化厂是新疆石油公司建筑工人在苏联专家指导下，第一次在严寒的冬季进行室外施工建成的。由于各族工人克服了各种困难，这座焦化厂比计划提前一个多月投入生产。（新华社）
