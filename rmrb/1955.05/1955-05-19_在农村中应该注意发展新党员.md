　　With the progress of the socialist transformation of agriculture, our Party's organization in rural areas has become stronger. In 1954, the whole country admitted more than 700,000 advanced elements from the working peasants into the Party. Many villages that previously had no Party organization now have Party organizations. The Party's leading role in the socialist transformation of agriculture has been greatly strengthened.

　　Our Party has always paid attention to the expansion and consolidation of the Party's grassroots organizations. Our Party has always developed Party organizations based on the principles of our Party and the development of the situation in various periods. In the past, without the hard work of the Party's grassroots organizations among the people, it would have been impossible for us to complete the major tasks of various revolutionary periods. Today, without the leadership and exemplary role of the Party's grassroots organizations and Communist Party members, the socialist transformation movement of agriculture cannot be consolidated and developed; at the same time, the Party's grassroots organizations in rural areas cannot be developed and consolidated if they are separated from the socialist transformation movement of agriculture.

　　Whether there is a Party grassroots organization, the strength of the Party grassroots organization, and the quality of its work directly affect the speed and effectiveness of the socialist transformation of agriculture. However, at present, there are still some areas in the country where Party grassroots organizations have not been established, or although Party grassroots organizations have been established, there are very few Party members in these organizations, making it difficult to fully exert the Party's leading role. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to establish Party organizations in areas where there are no Party grassroots organizations, and to continue to develop Party members in areas where there are few Party members; even in old revolutionary base areas with more Party members, we should continuously admit activists in the socialist transformation cause into the Party to increase the Party's new strength. However, some Party leading organs have adopted incorrect attitudes towards the work of developing Party members and establishing Party organizations. The Lueyang County Party Committee in Shaanxi Province is one example. In the autumn of 1954, none of the eleven agricultural production cooperatives and the twelve agricultural production cooperatives being prepared for establishment in Lueyang County had a Party member, and the Lueyang County Party Committee did not arrange the work of developing Party members while arranging the central work. It is inappropriate to take such a passive attitude towards the expansion and consolidation of the Party's grassroots organizations.

　　In actively developing Party members and establishing Party grassroots organizations, we must abide by the Party Constitution and adopt realistic and pragmatic methods that are in line with actual conditions. At present, many local Party committees have formulated a practical and feasible plan for developing Party members based on the needs of current work and objective and subjective conditions, emphasizing that the development of Party members must be combined with the central work, and that the Party's requirements must be met. This is correct. However, some places have regarded "every township has a branch, and every cooperative has a Party member" as a crash task, disregarding objective conditions and attempting to achieve this requirement all at once. Wuyun and Gaobei townships in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, once did this. As a result, 11 of the 35 new Party members developed in these two townships did not meet the conditions for Party membership. This practice of simply pursuing numbers and lowering the standards for Party members is completely wrong.

　　What our Party wants to admit into the Party are advanced elements among the working class and working people, not just anyone. Only in this way can we maintain the Party as an advanced and organized force of the working class. Therefore, we must strictly follow the conditions for Party membership stipulated in the Party Constitution to admit new Party members. Now some Party organizations lower the Party's principles to admit Party members, and some places have proposed conditions such as "joining the cooperative can join the Party" and "selling surplus grain guarantees Party membership." This is a big mistake. Participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and selling surplus grain, even if it is truly an expression of socialist consciousness, cannot be used as the sole condition for joining the Party. When the Party admits a Party member, it must conduct a comprehensive and prudent examination of his class composition, struggle history, class stand, degree of political awareness, contact with the masses, and work performance, and only after education can those outstanding elements who are truly willing to fight for the cause of communism and truly meet the standards for Party members be admitted into the Party.

　　At present, many people are willing to join the Communist Party. Of course, many of them are advanced elements. But there are also some speculators who attempt to infiltrate the Party to realize their personal ambitions and other purposes. Moreover, hidden counter-revolutionaries are doing everything possible to infiltrate our Party to carry out various destructive activities. Therefore, we must be vigilant in carrying out the work of developing Party members. We should insist on developing Party members according to the standards for Party members, which is an iron principle that cannot be compromised in the slightest.

　　Strict procedures for admitting Party members are an important link to ensure the quality of Party members. Through strict investigation, those who truly meet the conditions for Party membership are admitted into the Party, while those who do not meet the conditions for Party membership should not be admitted; as for speculators and counter-revolutionaries who attempt to infiltrate the Party organization to carry out destructive activities, they will be exposed. Party organizations in many areas are admitting Party members in this way, so they have ensured that the vast majority of Party members admitted meet the Party's requirements. However, there are also a small number of Party organizations that have not followed the prescribed procedures to admit Party members. For example, in Lushan County, Guizhou Province, many new Party members' application forms for Party membership did not fill in the opinions of the Party committee, which made it impossible to understand whether the Party committee had approved these people to join the Party. The application forms for Party membership of the ten Party members admitted by District 1 of Cengong County in September 1954 did not have the opinions of the introducers or the resolutions of the Party congress. May I ask, when these people joined the Party, were there any responsible introducers? Did the Party congress discuss and approve it? This practice is very dangerous. In Lushan County, it was because a county Party committee member did not admit Party members in accordance with the Party's regulations that he mistakenly admitted a counter-revolutionary element as a Party member (who has now been expelled from the Party). Therefore, the Party's grassroots organizations must strictly select and review development targets, strengthen their education, and have formal Party members responsible for introducing them into the Party, discuss and approve them at the Party congress, and report to the Party's leading organs for review and approval. Admitting Party members in accordance with strict procedures is precisely a manifestation of the seriousness of our Party.

　　Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report at the First National Organizational Work Conference: "The conditions for Party members should be high, and the procedures for joining the Party should be strict, but it is also necessary to develop Party members and establish Party organizations. This is certainly not an easy task. The success or failure of this work depends on whether we can carry out a series of in-depth propaganda, education and organizational work among the workers and working people on a universal and regular basis." This is what we should do and must do in the work of developing new Party members.

### 在农村中应该注意发展新党员

　　在农村中应该注意发展新党员
    随着农业社会主义改造事业的进展，我们的党在农村的组织更加壮大了。一九五四年全国共接收了七十多万劳动农民中的先进分子入党。许多原来没有党组织的乡村现在有了党的组织。党对农业进行社会主义改造的领导作用大大地加强了。
    我们党从来就注意党的基层组织的扩大和巩固工作。我们党从来都是根据我们党的原则和各个时期的形势发展来发展党的组织的。过去，如果没有党的基层组织在人民群众中进行艰巨的工作，我们就不可能完成各个革命时期的重大任务。今天，农业的社会主义改造运动，如果没有党的基层组织和共产党员的领导和模范作用，就不可能得到巩固和发展；同时党在农村的基层组织，如果离开农业的社会主义改造运动也是不可能得到发展和巩固的。
    有没有党的基层组织，党的基层组织的力量大小，工作好坏，都直接影响着对农业进行社会主义改造的速度和成效。但是，目前全国还有一些地区没有建立党的基层组织，或者虽然已经建立了党的基层组织，可是这些组织中的党员很少，难以充分发挥党的领导作用。因此目前亟需在这些没有党的基层组织地区建立党的组织，在党员少的地区继续发展党员；即使在党员较多的老区农村中，也应该不断地接收社会主义改造事业中的积极分子入党，以增加党的新生力量。可是有些党的领导机关对于发展党员、建立党组织的工作，采取了不正确的态度。陕西略阳县委就是一个例子。一九五四年秋季略阳全县十一个农业生产合作社和正在筹建的十二个农业生产合作社中没有一个党员，略阳县委却没有在布置中心工作的同时布置发展党员的工作。这样对待党的基层组织的扩大和巩固工作采取消极态度是不应当的。
    在积极进行发展党员和建立党的基层组织的工作中，我们必须遵照党章，采取切合实际情况的实事求是的方法。现在有许多地方党委根据当前工作需要和主客观条件，制定出一个切实可行的发展党员的计划，强调了发展党员必须结合中心工作，并且必须保证所接收的党员一定符合党的要求。这是正确的。但是有些地方却把“乡乡有支部，社社有党员”当做了突击的任务，不顾客观条件，企图一下就实现这个要求。浙江绍兴县五云、皋北两个乡就曾经这样作。结果，这两个乡所发展的三十五名新党员中，就有十一名没有具备党员条件。这种单纯追求数字、降低党员标准的作法，是完全错误的。
    我们党所要接收入党的是工人阶级和劳动人民中的先进分子，而不是随便什么人。只有这样，才能保持党作为工人阶级先进的有组织的部队。因此我们必须严格地按照党章规定的党员条件来接收新党员。现在有些党组织降低党的原则来接收党员，有些地方提出了什么“参加合作社就可以入党”、“卖出余粮，保证入党”等条件。这是很大的错误。参加互助合作组织，卖出余粮，即使真正是社会主义觉悟的一种表现，也不能作为入党的唯一条件。党接收一个党员，必须对他的阶级成份，斗争历史，阶级立场，政治觉悟程度，和群众的联系，工作表现等方面，作全面慎重的考察，经过教育之后，才能把那些确实愿意为共产主义事业奋斗，并确实符合党员标准的优秀分子接收入党。
    现在有不少人愿意参加共产党。当然，其中有不少是先进分子。但也有些投机分子企图混进党内实现个人野心和其他目的。而潜藏的反革命分子更是千方百计地想钻到我们党里面来，进行各种破坏活动。因此，我们必须警惕地来进行发展党员的工作。应该坚持按照党员标准来发展党员，这是丝毫也不能妥协的铁的原则。
    严格接收党员的手续，是保证党员质量的重要环节。经过严格的考察工作，把确实具备党员条件的人接收入党，而没有具备党员条件的人则不应接收入党；至于企图钻到党组织里来进行破坏活动的投机分子及反革命分子，就会被揭发出来。许多地区的党组织正是这样来接收党员的，所以保证了接收的党员绝大部分是符合党的要求的。但是也有少数地区的党组织没有按照规定的手续来接收党员。例如：贵州炉山县有许多新党员的入党志愿书上没有填写党委的意见，这就使人不懂得究竟党委有没有批准这些人入党。岑巩县一区一九五四年九月份接收的十名党员的入党志愿书上都没有写介绍人的意见和党员大会的决议。请问，这些人入党，到底有没有负责的介绍人呢？党员大会有没有讨论通过呢？这种作法是非常危险的。炉山县就因为一个县委委员没有按照党的规定接收党员，误把一个反革命分子接收为党员（现已开除出党）。因此，党的基层组织必须严格地挑选和审查发展对象，加强对他们的教育，并由正式党员负责介绍入党，在党员大会上讨论通过，报告党的领导机关审查批准。这样按照严格的手续接收党员，正是我们党的严肃性的一个表现。
    刘少奇同志在第一次全国组织工作会议报告中曾指出：“党员条件要高，入党手续要严，但是又必须发展党员建立党的组织。这当然是一件不容易的工作。这件工作的成功与否，就决定于我们能否在工人和劳动人民群众中普遍地经常地进行一系列的深入的宣传教育工作和组织工作。”这就是我们在发展新党员工作中所应该做到而且必须做到的。
