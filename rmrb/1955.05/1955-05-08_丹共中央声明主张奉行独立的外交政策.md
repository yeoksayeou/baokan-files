Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, 6th (TASS dispatch): "Land og Folk" published a statement from the Central Committee of the Danish Communist Party on Liberation Day (the 5th). The statement pointed out that the Danish people's desire for a peaceful, democratic, and happy life remains unfulfilled because Denmark has joined a military bloc serving the interests of the United States and is facing a new threat posed by West Germany's remilitarization. The Central Committee of the Danish Communist Party called on the people to strive against turning Denmark into a base for foreign troops, and pointed out: "Denmark must pursue an independent foreign policy that conforms to its interests. It must first of all support all efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of international disputes."

　　丹共中央声明主张奉行独立的外交政策
    新华社七日讯　塔斯社哥本哈根六日讯：“国土与人民报”在解放日（五日）发表了丹麦共产党中央委员会的一篇声明。声明指出，丹麦人民过和平民主和幸福生活的愿望依然没有实现，因为丹麦加入了为美国利益服务的军事集团，并且正面临着西德因重新军国主义化而引起的新的威胁。丹共中央委员会号召人民为反对把丹麦变成外国军队的基地而努力，并指出：“丹麦必须奉行符合于它的利益的独立的外交政策。它必须首先支持争取和平解决国际争端的一切努力。”
