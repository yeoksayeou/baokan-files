The cooperation groups in Youxi Town
    In Youxi Town, Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, more than 200 small merchants and peddlers, under the leadership of the local supply and marketing cooperative, have organized 20 cooperation groups. In addition to doing business at the market on fair days, they usually have more than 50 peddlers carrying many agricultural tool parts and oil, salt, sugar, and cloth, and carry them to the surrounding mountain villages to sell goods. Since March, it has been the busiest season for farmers' spring plowing. Farmers within dozens of miles around Youxi Town have no time to go to the market, so they can buy what they need at their doorsteps. After mid-April, many unorganized small vendors also followed suit and delivered goods to the countryside.
    The seven townships supplied by the Youxi Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative are hilly areas with inconvenient transportation. Three of these townships have no market. In the past, farmers had to set off before dawn to buy and sell things, often delaying a day's production. Chen Shuquan's mutual aid group in Banzhu Village had to specifically assign a group member to be responsible for buying things for the entire group when transplanting seedlings last year, and the group assessed work points and recorded them. Now, although it is the season for transplanting seedlings, the group members can buy all kinds of goods they need at their doorsteps. The Tuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wudong Township, which is far from the market, can save more than 30 laborers every fair day because small merchants and peddlers deliver goods to the countryside.

### 油溪镇的合作小组

　　油溪镇的合作小组
    四川江津县油溪镇有二百多家小商小贩在当地供销合作社领导下，组织了二十个合作小组。他们除了逢场天在集市上营业外，平时每天有五十多个货郎担带着许多农具的配件和油、盐、糖、布，挑向周围的山村出售货物。三月份以来，正是农民春耕最繁忙的季节，油溪镇周围几十里内，没有空赶集的农民，就在家门口买到了需要的东西。四月中旬以后，许多没有组织起来的小商贩也跟着送货下乡了。
    油溪镇供销合作社负责供应的七个乡都是交通不便的丘陵地区。其中有三个乡没有集场。农民过去买卖一些东西，天不亮就要动身，常常要耽误一天的生产。班竹村陈树全互助组去年栽秧时，不得不专门抽出一个组员负责为全组买东西，由组内评工记分。现在虽然到了插秧的季节，可是，组员们就在自己的家门口买到了所需要的各种货品。距集市较远的五洞乡团结农业生产合作社因为小商小贩下乡送货，每逢场期可以节省三十多个劳动力。
