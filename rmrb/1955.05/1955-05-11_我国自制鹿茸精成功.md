Our Country Successfully Manufactures Deer Antler Essence

The deer antler essence injection and oral liquid, produced for the first time in our country, have been successfully trial-produced at the Harbin Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, a local state-owned enterprise, and are now officially in production. The deer antler essence trial-produced by the Harbin Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory has been sampled and tested by the Ministry of Health and the Harbin Drug Inspection Institute and found to be qualified. Clinical trials at the Harbin Municipal State-Owned Industrial Workers' Hospital have proven it to be effective. The Ministry of Health has now approved the factory to produce and sell it.

In order to supply the needs of the people and strengthen the research of traditional Chinese medicine, the staff of the Harbin Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory began to use domestic deer antlers as raw materials in August 1954, referring to the dosage forms and testing methods of Soviet products to trial-produce deer antler essence. After active research and experimentation, overcoming difficulties in equipment and instruments, they finally succeeded in trial-producing it at the end of 1954.

Deer antler essence is a nutritional drug used as a tonic in cardiovascular, nervous, and other diseases.

　　我国自制鹿茸精成功
    我国首次生产的鹿茸精注射剂、内服剂已经在地方国营哈尔滨化学制药厂试制成功，现在已经正式开始生产。哈尔滨化学制药厂试制的鹿茸精，经过卫生部和哈尔滨药品检验所抽样检验合格，并经哈尔滨市地方国营工业职工医院临床试验，证明效果良好。现在，卫生部已经准许这个厂制售。
    为了供应人民的需要和加强中药研究，哈尔滨化学制药厂的职工从一九五四年八月就开始用国产的鹿茸作原料，参考苏联产品剂型和检验方法试制鹿茸精。经过积极研究试验，克服设备和仪器上的困难，终于在一九五四年末试制成功。
    鹿茸精是一种营养药品，用于心脏血管系、神经系和其他疾病中作强壮剂。
