　　Everyone is responsible for executing the grain sales plan
　　Yang Ye
    In many rural areas, an abnormal phenomenon has occurred: those who genuinely lack grain want to buy grain, those who falsely claim to lack grain also want to buy grain, those who should buy less want to buy more, and those who should buy later want to buy earlier. Everyone is shouting "grain shortage," making it difficult to distinguish between truth and falsehood.
    Why are people who don't lack grain also clamoring about "grain shortage"? The main reason is that they have some unresolved issues in their minds.
    It is originally a glorious thing to sell surplus grain to the state during the state's unified purchase of grain. However, some people feel it is even more glorious to be a "unified sales household." Seeing others receiving grain purchase certificates while they don't have one, they feel "embarrassed." They shout "grain shortage," want grain purchase certificates, and buy some grain just to get the title of "unified sales household." In fact, having or not having a grain purchase certificate has absolutely nothing to do with being politically glorious or not. Most of those who lack grain are poor peasants. Their difficult lives are ultimately the result of long-term exploitation in the past, and they are particularly active in taking the socialist road. In this sense, they are glorious. But what does this have to do with having or not having a grain purchase certificate? They had to buy grain even before the implementation of unified purchase and sales. The method of unified purchase and sales ensures that they are not exploited when buying grain and that they do not go hungry because they cannot buy grain. This is for rationality, not a special preferential treatment for them. Just from this matter alone, one cannot say "glorious" or "not glorious." Striving to save, actively increasing production, and selling more surplus grain are even more glorious!
    Some peasants who do not lack grain or even have surplus grain also shout "grain shortage" because they are afraid that others will say they are not "thorough" in selling surplus grain, that grain-deficient households will borrow grain from them, and that they will be forced to "regulate" or "share with each other." Some people want to sell less grain during this year's unified purchase, so they adopt a strategy of "attack is the best defense," claiming everywhere that their grain is not enough to eat, and "registering" with the cadres first. They think: If they shout like this, even if they cannot keep much grain after the summer and autumn harvests, they can at least avoid selling more. The more people who shout "grain shortage," the more panicked those who do not lack grain become. Some people think: "If others are shouting grain shortage and I don't, won't it show that I have grain?" So they also start shouting. In fact, the government has long stipulated that after each year's unified purchase, farmers can freely dispose of their own grain. Storing it is legal, and selling it in the state grain market is also legal, as long as it is not sold to private merchants and grain is not used for speculation. No one is allowed to interfere, nor is anyone allowed to force "regulation." If someone randomly "labels" others, that is wrong, and the person being "labeled" can protest and criticize the person who randomly "labels" others. As for the number of unified purchases in the future, it will be rationally allocated according to the actual situation. The past allocation may not have been completely fair and reasonable, and it is right to demand greater fairness and rationality. However, one cannot sell less grain just because one has "registered."
    Some peasants, although lacking grain, are not short of it at the moment. They demand early supply because they are afraid that coarse grains will no longer be supplied after the wheat harvest, or that others will buy up the grain and they will not be able to buy it. They have the idea of "first come, first served," believing that the sooner they buy it, the better. They believe: "Eating 'the state's grain' first and then eating 'one's own grain' is a safe and good strategy." In this way, those who should buy later buy earlier, and some who should buy earlier may not be able to buy it. The state has a fixed number of grain supplies for each period. Disrupting the plan makes it difficult to do the supply work well. It should be believed that the state will guarantee the supply of essential grain to grain-deficient households. When there is a real shortage, the supply will be guaranteed. The varieties of grain should also be adjusted as much as possible. After the wheat is harvested, coarse grains will still be supplied.
    Some peasants buy enough grain, but when others have more grain than they do, they compare with others and demand to buy more. Generally, grain-deficient peasants used to pay special attention to saving grain in the spring, but now some people think "the state guarantees supply anyway," so they no longer save. Some people compare their current grain with the situation in the past when the old crop ran out before the new one was harvested, especially compared to before liberation, and feel that they have much more grain. However, when compared with some people who have more grain, they feel that their own grain is too little. This cannot be compared. Grain production has not increased much. If everyone demands to increase consumption by a large amount, where will so much grain come from?
    There are also a few people who want to take advantage of this. They secretly sell their grain at high prices and then want to buy from the state at the listed price. Some people collect grain coupons to sell them privately to others, even to speculators. This is illegal, and the government will absolutely not allow it. Even if one can take advantage of it temporarily, if the state's planned supply work is disrupted and speculators control a large amount of grain, it will be a great disaster for every working people. At first glance, superficially, it seems like taking advantage and being a "smart person," but in fact, one will suffer a great loss and be the most foolish person.
    Who benefits from so many people shouting "grain shortage" and wanting to buy grain, distinguishing truth from falsehood? Of course, it is not beneficial to the state, nor to grain-deficient households, nor to general non-grain-deficient households. Who is most happy to see people shouting like this? Only a few bad people who plan to fish in troubled waters. In some places, it is the landlords, rich peasants, profiteers, and counter-revolutionaries who take the lead in creating rumors and sabotage, making everyone feel uneasy and shout. Some bad people have intervened after everyone started shouting, stirring up trouble. They are deliberately sabotaging our socialist construction cause. If this goes on and breaks through the state's grain supply plan, making it difficult for national construction, making it impossible for truly grain-deficient people to get supplies, and even disrupting the entire market and destroying the stable price situation, it will be exactly what they want. By disrupting the grain supply work and the entire market, it will be easier to conduct black market speculation, facilitate hoarding and stockpiling, and exploit urban and rural working people. The government will severely punish these saboteurs! Peasants should see through the conspiracies of these bad people and never follow them blindly, and not be fooled by them!
    The state buys a certain amount of grain from farmers, and the amount of grain that can be supplied cannot be without a certain amount. If someone buys too much, someone will definitely not buy enough. If someone who should not buy buys, someone who should buy will definitely not be able to buy. Isn't it harming one's own brothers and sisters if one buys a lot of grain and cannot finish eating it, while other grain-deficient peasants go hungry? Isn't it hindering national industrial construction? In the final analysis, isn't it harming oneself?
    The state must supply what should be supplied, and must not supply what should not be supplied. It will never supply more than what should be supplied, and it will never supply earlier than what should be supplied. For cadres who engage in favoritism and malpractice, they must be corrected and, if necessary, punished. For bad elements who create rumors and sabotage, they must be punished. Grain-deficient peasants, calculate your production and life more accurately. Buy as much grain as you really need, buy less if you should buy less, and buy later if you should buy later. Non-grain-deficient peasants, do not ask to buy grain anymore. For the sake of the country's interests, for the interests of the people of the whole country and all working peasants, everyone should help the government do a good job in rectifying the work of unified grain sales. Let us work together to ensure that the state's grain supply plan is not broken through! Let us quickly concentrate our minds and efforts on mutual aid and cooperation and increasing production!

### 执行售粮计划，人人都有责任

　　执行售粮计划，人人都有责任
　　杨叶
    在许多地方的农村里，发生了一种反常的现象：真缺粮的要买粮，假缺粮的也买粮，该少买的要多买，该迟买的要早买；大家都喊“缺粮”，就弄得真假不分了。
    不缺粮的人为什么也吵着“缺粮”呢？主要原因是他们心里有些疙疸没解开。
    在国家统购粮食的时候，把余粮卖给了国家，这本来是光荣的事情。可是，有些人却觉得当个“统销户”更光荣；看到别人领了购粮证，自己手里没有购粮证，就觉得“怪丢人的”。他们喊“缺粮”，要购粮证，买一些粮食，为的是得个“统销户”的称呼。其实，有没有购粮证同政治上光荣不光荣，是半点关系也没有的。缺粮的大部分是贫农；他们生活困难，归根到底是过去长期受剥削的结果，他们对于走社会主义道路特别积极；从这一点说，他们是光荣的。但这同有没有购粮证又有什么关系呢？他们在实行统购统销以前也要买粮食；统购统销的办法使他们在买粮食的时候不受剥削，使他们不至于买不到粮食挨饿。这是为了合理，并不是对他们有什么特别的优待。光就这件事来说，说不上“光荣”“不光荣”。努力节约，积极增产，多卖余粮，那才更光荣哩！
    有些不缺粮甚至还有余粮的农民也大叫“缺粮”，是怕别人说他卖余粮“不彻底”，怕缺粮户向自己借粮食，还怕强迫“调剂”、“互通有无”。有些人想在今年统购时少卖一些，就采取“以攻为守”的办法，到处讲自己的粮食不够吃，先在干部那里“挂个号”。他们想：这样一叫，即使夏天秋天打下粮食不能多留，至少也可以免得多卖。喊“缺粮”的人越多，不缺粮的人越是心慌。有些人想：
  “别人都喊缺粮，自己不喊，不就显出我有粮食吗？”就也跟着喊起来了。其实，政府早已规定，每年统购以后，农民自己的粮食完全可以自由处理，存放起来是合法的，到国家粮食市场去卖也是合法的，只要不卖给私商，不利用粮食作投机活动，谁也不得干涉，也不许任何人强迫“调剂”。如果有人乱给“扣帽子”，那是错误的，被“扣帽子”的人可以提出抗议，可以反过来批评这种乱给别人“扣帽子”的人。至于以后的统购数目，那是要按照实际情况合理分配的。过去分配的可能不完全公平合理，要求更加公平合理是应该的；可是，并不会因为谁“挂了号”就可以少卖粮食。
    有些农民虽然缺粮，但是眼前并不缺。他们要求提前供应，是怕麦收后就不再供应粗粮了，或者怕别人把粮食买光，自己就买不到了。他们存着
  “先下手为强”的想法，认为越早买到手越好。他们认为：“先吃‘国家的粮食’，后吃‘自己的粮食’，是个保险的好计策。”这样，该迟买的早买了，有些该早买的就可能买不到了。国家哪个时期供应多少粮食是有定数的；把计划打乱了，供应工作就很难做好了。应当相信，对缺粮户必不可少的粮食，国家一定要保证供应；什么时候真缺，什么时候一定供应；粮食的品种也要尽可能调剂，麦子打下来以后，粗粮还是要供应的。
    有些农民买的粮食本来已经够吃了，可是，到别人的粮食比自己的多了一些，就同别人攀比，要求多买一些。一般缺粮的农民，过去在春季看特别注意节约粮食的，现在有些人认为“反正国家保证供应”，就不再节约了。有些人现有的粮食是同过去青黄不接时期的情况比较，特别是同解放前比较，已经多得多了，但同某些粮食较多的人比较，就觉得自己的粮食太少。这是比不得的。粮食的产量并没有提高很多，如果大家都要求把消费量增加很多，哪来这么多粮食呢？
    也有少数人想在这中间沾些便宜。他们暗地把自己的粮食用高价卖了，又要向国家按牌价买。有些人领粮票是为了私下卖给别人，甚至卖给投机商人。这样做是犯法的，政府是绝对不能允许的。这样做，即使一时可以沾点便宜，但是，如果把国家的计划供应工作破坏了，让投机的人把大批粮食掌握了，对每个劳动人民都将是很大的祸害。一时看起来，表面上看起来，好像是沾了便宜，做了“聪明人”；其实，是要吃大亏的，是最糊涂的人。
    许多人这样乱吵“缺粮”，都要买粮，真假不分，对谁有利呢？对国家当然不利，对缺粮户不利，对一般的不缺粮户也不利。谁最高兴人们这样乱吵呢？只有少数打算在这中间混水摸鱼的坏人。在有些地方，正是地主、富农、奸商、反革命分子起头造谣破坏，弄得大家心神不安、乱吵起来的；有些坏人是在大家吵起来以后，插了进来，兴风作浪的。他们是存心破坏我们的社会主义建设事业的；这样闹来闹去，把国家粮食供应计划突破了，使国家建设碰到了困难，使真正缺粮的人得不到供应，甚至使整个市场混乱起来，把物价稳定的局面破坏了，才正合他们的心愿。他们捣乱了粮食供应工作，捣乱了整个市场，就便于进行黑市投机，便于套购、囤积；便于剥削城乡劳动人民。对于这些破坏分子，政府是一定要严厉惩罚的！农民们应该看穿这些坏人的阴谋诡计，千万不要跟着他们瞎闹，不要上他们的当！
    国家向农民买的粮食是有一定数目的，能够供应的粮食也不能没有一定的数目。有人多买了，就必定会有人买不够；有不该买的买了，就必定会有该买的人买不到。自己买许多粮食吃不完，却让别的缺粮的农民饿肚子，岂不是坑害了自己的弟兄姊妹们吗？岂不是要妨害国家工业建设吗？归根究底，还不是坑害了自己吗？
    应该供应的，国家一定要供应；不该供应的，一定不供应；应该少供应的，决不多供应；应该迟供应的，决不早供应；对循私舞弊的干部，一定要纠正，必要时加以处分；对于造谣破坏的坏分子，一定要惩办。缺粮的农民，更精确地把自己的生产和生活计算一下吧，确实需要多少粮食就买多少，该少买就不要多买，该迟买就不要早买。不缺粮的农民，不要再要求买粮食了。为了国家的利益，为了全国人民和全体劳动农民的利益，大家都应该来帮助政府把整顿粮食统销的工作做好。让我们同心协力，保证国家供应粮食的计划不被突破！让我们快些把心思和力量集中在互助合作和增加生产方面吧！
