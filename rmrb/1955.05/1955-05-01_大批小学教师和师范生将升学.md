The Ministry of Education recently issued instructions to select more than 11,000 outstanding primary school teachers and graduating students from normal schools across the country to apply for advanced studies in higher normal schools. The instructions specified the selection criteria and procedures. The selected primary school teachers or normal school graduates must participate in the unified national college entrance examination in accordance with the regulations for the 1955 summer enrollment of national colleges and universities, which will be promulgated soon. The instructions emphasized that education administrative departments across the country should earnestly implement the principle of careful review and selection of the best candidates during the selection process. It is also necessary to do a good job in ideological education, educating both the selected and unselected primary school teachers and graduates to have a correct understanding of further education or engaging in primary school education.
