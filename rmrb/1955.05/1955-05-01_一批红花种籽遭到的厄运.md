The Unfortunate Fate of a Batch of Safflower Seeds

In July and August of 1953, the Guangdong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Northern Guangdong Office purchased over 800,000 jin of safflower seeds (green manure seeds) from Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, intending to supply them to farmers in the Northern Guangdong region for winter planting that year. However, two winters have passed, and aside from the 520,000 jin that were half-given and half-sold to Zhejiang Province in the autumn of 1954, only 160,000 to 170,000 jin were sold in the Northern Guangdong region. Approximately 150,000 jin of safflower seeds are still stockpiled in warehouses in various counties.

Why did this batch of safflower seeds, purchased from afar in other provinces, end up stockpiled in warehouses and unwanted? It's a long story.

In 1953, the Guangdong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Northern Guangdong Office saw that farmers in Lian County in the Northern Guangdong region had been purchasing and planting large quantities of safflower seeds from other provinces for years, and they grew well and had a great fertilizing effect. They thought that since farmers in Lian County could grow them, other regions could certainly grow them as well, which would be a profitable business beneficial to production. Therefore, after consulting with the CCP Northern Guangdong District Committee, but without contacting the relevant agricultural departments, they sent cadres to other provinces to purchase seeds. The purchasing personnel initially struck out in Hunan and Jiangxi before moving on to Jiangsu and Anhui.

After the safflower seeds were transported back, they were distributed to various counties. Just as some regions were beginning to sow the seeds, the Northern Guangdong Administrative Office's Agriculture Department happened to conduct a test and found that the germination rate was less than 20 percent. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Northern Guangdong Office was shocked and immediately sent people with samples to Jiangsu Province to request a return of the goods. However, after retesting by the relevant departments in Jiangsu, the germination rate was found to be over 50 percent. Furthermore, to be cautious, they even sent two cadres to Northern Guangdong to assist in testing, which also proved that the germination rate could meet the standard. Thus, there was no reason to return the goods. However, after this series of twists and turns, the winter planting season of 1953 had passed, and only 70,000 to 80,000 jin were sold that year, with the rest being stockpiled. Of the 70,000 to 80,000 jin that were sold, they grew relatively well only in Lian County, while they grew poorly in other counties. Why did they grow poorly? Was it because the soil and climate were unsuitable, or because of improper technical handling? There was no conclusion. But it was generally believed that this batch of safflower seeds could not be planted. So what to do? Sell them to other provinces? No one wanted them. Use them to feed pigs? The pigs wouldn't eat them. Use them to extract oil? The oil yield was only 3 percent. Give them to farmers? The farmers didn't want them. Throwing them away would be a pity. There was no solution but to let them lie in the warehouse.

Thus, spring passed and summer came, and the winter planting season of 1954 arrived. At this time, the cadres of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Northern Guangdong Office heard that Zhejiang needed a large quantity of safflower seeds, but they could only be purchased at Zhejiang Province's listed price of 11 yuan per dan, and they had to be delivered to Zhejiang. These safflower seeds were originally purchased for 23 yuan per dan, and if they were transported to Zhejiang for sale, the freight would cost 4 yuan per dan. But they couldn't worry about all that anymore. As long as someone wanted them, they could at least recoup some of the losses. Thus, this batch of safflower seeds, which had originally been transported south along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and had been stockpiled for more than a year, was now being transported back along the same railway. Who knew that at this time, Guangdong Province also demanded an expansion of the winter planting area in 1954, and there was a general shortage of green manure seeds. The Rural Work Department of the CCP Northern Guangdong District Committee suddenly remembered this batch of safflower seeds that had been stockpiled for more than a year. As a result, aside from the 520,000 jin that had already been shipped out and could not be retrieved, the remaining 240,000 jin were immediately stopped from being shipped out and were adjusted according to the winter planting tasks of each county and sold at a reduced price. However, aside from the 90,000 jin sold in Lian County, no one in other regions wanted them due to farmers' unfamiliarity with planting and the drought. As a result, they were still stockpiled. Now, they can only wait until the winter planting season of 1955 arrives to finally determine their fate.

　　一批红花种籽遭到的厄运
    一九五三年七、八月间，广东省供销合作社粤北办事处从江苏、安徽两省采购了八十多万斤红花籽（绿肥种籽），准备供应粤北区农民当年冬种用的。但是两个冬天已经过去了，这批红花籽除了在一九五四年秋天半送半卖的转销给浙江省五十二万斤外，在粤北地区只推销出去十六、七万斤，到现在还有约十五万斤红花籽积存在各县的仓库里。
    为什么老远地从外省采购来的这批红花籽，又会积压在仓库里而没有人要呢？说来话长。
    一九五三年，广东省供销合作社粤北办事处看见粤北区连县农民历年来都从外省采购回来大批红花籽种植，生长良好，肥效又大。他们心想连县农民既然可以种，那其他地区也一定可以种，这倒是一宗有利生产的大买卖，于是，在请示了中共粤北区委员会以后，也不和有关的农业部门联系，就派出干部到外省去采购。采购人员先到湖南、江西扑了个空，以后又转到江苏、安徽。
    红花籽运来后分到了各县。正当有的地区开始下种的时候，粤北行署农业处偶然进行了一次化验，发现发芽率不到百分之二十。供销社粤北办事处大吃一惊，马上派人带着样品到江苏省要求退货。但是经过江苏有关部门再化验，发芽率都达到百分之五十以上；同时为了慎重起见，他们还专门派了两个干部到粤北协助化验，也证明发芽率可以达到标准。这样就没有理由再退货了。但是经过这一番周折，一九五三年的冬种季节已过，而这一年合计只售出七、八万斤，其他都积压下来了。在已售出的七、八万斤中，除连县的生长较好外，其他各县的都生长不好。为什么生长不好呢？是因为土质、气候不适宜还是由于技术处理不当，没有结论。但一般都认为这一批红花籽是不能种的了。那怎么办呢？向外省推销吧，谁也不要；拿去喂猪，猪也不吃；拿去榨油，出油率只达百分之三；送给农民，农民也不要，倒掉又可惜，没有办法，只好让它躺在仓库里。
    这样春去夏来，一九五四年冬种季节又来了，这时候供销社粤北办事处的干部打听到浙江需要大批的红花籽，但只能按浙江省牌价每担十一元收购，并且还得运到浙江交货。这批红花籽原来是每担二十三元买回来的，如果再运到浙江出卖，每担运费就得赔四元。但这些都再也管不了，只要有人要，总可以捞回一些。于是这批原来沿着浙赣路南运、被积压了一年多的红花籽，现在又沿着这条铁路运回去。谁知正在这个时候，广东省也要求扩大一九五四年的冬种面积，绿肥种籽普遍缺乏，中共粤北区委会农村工作部忽然记起了这批积压了一年多的红花籽。结果除了已运出去的五十二万斤已追不回来外，剩下的二十四万斤就立刻停止外运，根据各县冬种任务，作了一番调整，并降价出售。但是除了连县售出九万斤外，其他地区由于农民不习惯种植，加上天旱，谁也不要，结果还是积压了下来。现在只好等到一九五五年冬种季节来到的时候，才能最后决定它们的命运。　吴尔祥
