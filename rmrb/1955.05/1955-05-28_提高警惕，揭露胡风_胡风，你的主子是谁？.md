    Raise Vigilance, Expose Hu Feng
　　Hu Feng, Who is Your Master?
　　Cao Yu
    Today, the people of the whole country have fully understood: Hu Feng and his small clique are an anti-Party, anti-people, counter-revolutionary organization. Hu Feng has always been an enemy irreconcilable with us, a hidden element lurking in the revolutionary ranks. I have never seen such an evil person as Hu Feng. So vicious, so insidious, so cunning, so treacherous, so unable to bear the light of day. A person as bad as this is truly a “marvel of ancient and modern times”! However, he and his small clique have been plotting and scheming around us for more than twenty years. Only today do we see that this devil has long hidden such a large pile of anti-Party, anti-people, counter-revolutionary things in his heart!
    What "five knives," what "three clubs," his slanderous nonsense about our literary front, there is no need to talk about it here again. According to the second batch of materials on the Hu Feng anti-Party group in the "People's Daily," we see again that after liberation, when the people of the whole country obtained days of freedom and happiness, Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary activities became even more rampant. He viciously slandered us and hated us. What "a literary world ruled by corpses," what "someone recording and checking even a cough," even Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art—the brilliant work in which our leader has ingeniously led us for many years on the road of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers—he wants to curse it as a "booklet treated as a 'totem'." He is determined to carry out a "heart-digging war" and a "nerve war" against us. He is "sharpening his sword" on one hand and "observing the direction" on the other. He says that he will wait until he is sure of the moment, willing to cut off his head and throw it out to "smash" the people's literary front. The cunning Hu Feng has a thorough plan. According to the "organizational principles" of their anti-Party group, he is determined to secretly wage a "struggle by drops" against us. He instigated his followers to use the "Sun Wukong entering the belly" tactic to infiltrate the Party, to infiltrate revolutionary organizations, and to establish strongholds. He wants to destroy our revolutionary ranks, one cell and one blood cell at a time.
    Can we still tolerate such sinful actions by the Hu Feng reactionary group?
    Comrades, the face of a good person is singular, but the face of an evil person is varied. It is precisely because Hu Feng has a varied, changeable face that he can superficially "shake hands and make peace" with us for a long time, while secretly launching vicious attacks against us behind our backs. And we have long been deceived by his skillful disguise, losing the vigilance of a revolutionary literary worker. In the past, when I and several friends mentioned Hu Feng, we always said that this person had a very narrow-minded personality, liked to engage in small sectarianism, and so on. Later, after understanding him a little, we recognized that he was just a despicable individualistic careerist, an anti-Marxist. In talking about it, we rarely viewed this counter-revolutionary from the perspective of serious political issues. Therefore, when it was mentioned that Hu Feng and Hu Shi were birds of a feather, some people would still try to distinguish him, as if this was a "gentlemanly" attitude towards people.
    Now, naturally, it is clear. But who made us understand? It is the Party that saw through the reactionary nature of this degenerate, thoroughly exposed his conspiracy, and opened our eyes. This is another major victory for the invincible Chinese Communist Party on the literary front! However, as literary warriors, to be honest, our vigilance is not high. Hu Feng issued "instructions" to his henchmen day and night, telling them to be "vigilant" against us. Even his wife would say "Civil servants must be wary" when the Writers Association found them a correspondent. And we actually allowed this group of anti-Party and anti-people elements to hide around us for a long time, giving them the opportunity to develop their strength and launch a rampant attack against us. We always shout "Vigilance, vigilance," but our vigilance is still not high. We are like a group of people who like to talk about the principle that "poisonous snakes can bite," but while we are talking, that dangerous thing has already secretly crawled into our clothes and is about to crawl into our hearts.
    In the future, we really can't be careless anymore. I very much agree with what Comrade Zhang Tianyi wrote in the "People's Daily." He said:
      "The political atmosphere in our literary and art circles should be strengthened, and liberalism can no longer be allowed; otherwise, counter-revolutionary hidden elements will still find loopholes. We must unite, but it must be unity with criticism; otherwise, counter-revolutionary hidden elements will still find loopholes. We cannot leave the Party spirit principle or separate ourselves from the masses for a moment; otherwise, counter-revolutionary hidden elements will still find loopholes."
    We should indeed read this passage carefully and think about it.
    Exposing Hu Feng's sinful actions does not mean that the sinful actions of the people in the Hu Feng anti-Party group have stopped here. Hu Feng has not given up. In February of this year, he told his henchmen to "endure," "only by enduring can we seek rebirth, everything is for the cause, for a more distant future." He is prepared to lie dormant and wait for an opportunity to rise again. Such a planned, organized, and far-sighted reactionary group cannot be without a reactionary master behind them to support them and be their backing. But the people will never be deceived by them again! We want to ask: "Hu Feng, who exactly is your master? Who exactly is your backstage boss?" Let me offer a clue first. When Hu Feng launched a rampant attack on the Party and the literary front led by the Party, the Taiwan radio immediately responded enthusiastically, and like Hu Feng, even the words of Hu Feng were completely preserved, shamelessly repeating Hu Feng's slander against the Party and the literary front led by the Party.
  The words "five knives" and "three clubs" became the content of the vile Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's response to Hu Feng's broadcast. They shamelessly echoed Hu Feng in an ugly duet, at one moment shamelessly shouting, "Speaking from the conscience, Mr. Hu Feng's words are indeed reasonable," and at another moment忍不住忍不住興高采烈地赞扬着, "Mr. Hu Feng's words really pinpoint the sadness and suffering of writers in mainland China today."
    What "sadness" and "suffering," this kind of despicable rumor is unbelievable. However, when the literature and art of the new China is like the rising sun exuding light, and every conscious literary and art worker feels unprecedented excitement and happiness, full of confidence in their future, isn't such lies and slander by the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandits exactly the same poisonous lies and slander that Hu Feng and his small clique are planning day and night to attack us and spread to the people?
    Hu Feng and the members of the Hu Feng group, listen! You must honestly surrender to the people! You must honestly confess, who exactly is your master? If the Voice of Taiwan does not represent your master, then you must also clearly confess, what other reactionary force is your master? We will pursue it, pursue it to the end. If you don't say it, the people will not let you get away with it.

### 提高警惕，揭露胡风　胡风，你的主子是谁？

    提高警惕，揭露胡风
　　胡风，你的主子是谁？
　　曹禺
    今天全国人民已经完全明白了：胡风和他的小集团是一个反党、反人民、反革命的组织，胡风一直就是一个跟我们势不两立的敌人，是隐匿在革命阵营里的暗藏分子。我从来没有见过像胡风这样的恶人。这样狠毒，这样阴险，这样奸诈，这样鬼祟，这样见不得阳光，人坏到了这样的地步，真是
  “今古奇观”！然而，他和他的小集团就在我们身边阴谋活动了二十多年。到了今天，我们才看出来，这个魔鬼的心里原来长期藏着这么一大堆反党、反人民、反革命的东西！
    什么“五把刀子”，“三根棍子”，他那一些污蔑我们文艺阵营的鬼话，已经无需在此地再谈了。根据“人民日报”上关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料，我们又看出，在解放以后，全国人民获得了自由幸福的日子的时候，胡风的反革命的活动却更猖狂起来。他穷凶极恶地污蔑我们，仇视我们。什么“僵尸统治的文坛”，什么“咳一声都有人来录音检查的”，甚至于毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话——这是多少年来我们的领袖天才地领导了我们真正走上为工农兵服务的道路的光辉著作——他也要把它诅咒成为“被当作了‘图腾’的小册子”。他决心向我们进行“挖心战”，“神经战”，他一面在
  “磨剑”，一面在“窥测方向”，他说，他要等到他看准了的时候，情愿割下他的头颅，抛掷出去，要把人民的文艺阵营“击碎”。诡计多端的胡风是有周密的计划的。根据他们反党集团的“组织原则”，他下了决心暗地里跟我们“点滴斗争”，他唆使他的党羽们“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”打进党内，打进革命团体里面，建立据点。他是想一个细胞一个血球地破坏我们的革命阵营。
    胡风反动集团这样罪恶的行动，我们还能够容忍吗？
    同志们，好人的面孔就是一个，恶人的面孔却是多种多样的，正因为胡风有一种多种多样的会变的面孔，他能长期地表面上跟我们“握手言欢”，却长期地在我们背后向我们狠毒地进攻。而我们呢，就长期地被他的善于伪装的面孔所欺骗，失去了一个革命的文艺工作者的警惕性。过去我和几个朋友一提起胡风，总好说这个人性格十分褊狭呀，好搞小宗派呀，种种。后来，明白了他一点，也不过认识到这是一个卑鄙的个人主义野心家，是反马克思主义的。谈来谈去，很少从严重的政治问题的角度上来看这个反革命分子。因此，一提到胡风和胡适是一丘之貉，有人还要替他区别一下，仿佛这样对人才“君子”似的。
    如今自然是弄明白了。但，谁使我们明白的呢？是党，看穿了这个败类的反动，彻底揭露了他的阴谋，才把我们的眼睛打开的。这是无坚不摧的中国共产党在文艺战线上的又一次的重大胜利！然而，做为文艺战士的我们，老实说，我们的警惕性是不高的。胡风日日夜夜地对他的党徒们下“指令”，要“警戒”我们，甚至他的老婆，当作家协会帮他们找来一个通讯员的时候，都会说“公家人不能不存戒心”。而我们居然让这群反党反人民的分子在我们身边长期隐蔽着，使他们有机会发展力量，向我们猖狂进攻。我们总好空喊“警惕，警惕”，然而警惕性仍然是不高的。我们像一群喜欢谈“毒蛇能咬人”的道理的人，但，正在谈着谈着的时候，那险毒的东西已经暗暗地爬到我们的衣服里，而且已经快要爬到我们的心上了。
    今后，我们真不能再马马虎虎的了，我是十分赞同张天翼同志在“人民日报”上所写的话的。他说：
      “我们文艺界政治空气应该加强，不能再容许自由主义了：否则，反革命暗藏分子是还会钻空子的。我们要团结，可是是有批评的团结：否则，反革命暗藏分子是还会钻空子的。我们一时一刻也不能离开党性原则，不能脱离群众：否则，反革命暗藏分子是还会钻空子的。”
    我们确实应该把这段话认真地读一读，想一想。
    揭露了胡风的罪恶行动，并不等于胡风反党集团的人们的罪恶行动就到此停止了。胡风是并没有死心的，他在今年二月还告诉他的党徒们要“忍受”，“只有在忍受中求得重生，一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来”。他是准备潜伏下来，伺机再起的。这样有计划、有组织、有长远打算的反动集团，是不可能没有反动的主子在他们背后为他们撑腰，做他们的后盾的。但人民是再也不会受他们的欺骗了！我们要问：“胡风，你的主子究竟是谁？你的后台老板究竟是谁？”让我先提一个线索吧。当胡风向党和党所领导的文艺战线发动了猖狂进攻以后，不久就来了台湾广播热烈的响应，和胡风一样，甚至连胡风的词句都完全保存着，无耻地重复着胡风对党和党所领导的文艺战线的污蔑。
  “五把刀子”，“三根棍子”的话就成了臭不可闻的蒋介石匪帮响应胡风的广播内容。他们丑恶地跟胡风一唱一和地策应起来，一会无耻地叫着，“凭良心说，胡风先生的话确实是有道理的”，一会又忍不住的兴高采烈地赞扬着，“胡风先生这段话，实在是一针见血的说出了今天在大陆上文艺作家的悲哀和苦闷”。
    什么“悲哀”、“苦闷”，这种卑鄙的造谣是无人相信的。但是，当着新中国的文艺正像初升的太阳吐露着光芒，每一个有觉悟的文艺工作者都感到从未有过的兴奋、快乐，对自己的前途信心百倍的时候，美蒋匪帮这样的谎话和污蔑，不恰恰就是胡风和他的小集团们日夜筹划着向我们进攻，向人们宣传着的同样毒恶的谎话和污蔑吗？
    胡风和胡风集团分子们听着！你们必须老老实实地向人民投降！你们必须老老实实地交代出来，你们的主子究竟是谁？如果台湾之音所代表的，不是你们的主子，那末，你们还得要明白交代，另外的什么反动势力是你们的主子？我们要追，追问下去。不说出来，人民是不和你们善罢甘休的。
