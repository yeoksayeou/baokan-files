　　Soldiers Demand the Digging Out of the Counter-Revolutionary Fortress
　　Letter from People's Liberation Army soldiers Jia Guoce and five others: We are the defenders of the motherland – soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. To defend the revolutionary cause that has been achieved and will be achieved, we are engaged in arduous struggles. We cannot tolerate the crimes of the disguised Hu Feng anti-Party clique. We fully support the resolution of the Joint Enlarged Meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to purge Hu Feng, the leader and organizer of the anti-Party clique, from the revolutionary camp, and suggest giving him severe legal sanctions!
　　Judging from the materials of the Hu Feng clique successively revealed by the "People's Daily", for the past twenty years, Hu Feng and his clique have consistently engaged in the sinful activities of opposing the Party, opposing the people, and counter-revolution. Since liberation, the anti-Party organization of the Hu Feng clique has further expanded, and its attacks on the Party have become even more rampant. This is not difficult to understand, because every victory of the revolutionary cause means the accelerated demise of counter-revolutionary elements; the deeper the revolution goes, the more rampant the resistance of counter-revolutionary elements becomes. Just look at how much Hu Feng hates the victory of the revolution! When we were cheering for the imminent liberation of the whole country, he felt "distressed" and like he was "wearing shackles." This is not surprising, because the liberation of the working people means putting shackles on counter-revolutionary elements. And how gloating he is about our shortcomings and mistakes!
　　The counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng clique are for their "future." Everyone knows that the "future" hoped for by counter-revolutionary elements is the restoration of the counter-revolutionary regime and the downfall of the people's regime, which is also what American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang hope for. From this, what difference is there between the Hu Feng anti-Party clique and a special agent organization?
　　The exposure of the Hu Feng clique proves the correctness of the leadership of the Party Central Committee. This is a major victory in the class struggle in the process of socialist revolution. At the same time, we should learn a lesson from this, redouble our vigilance, and not let the enemy find loopholes to attack by taking advantage of our shortcomings and mistakes.
　　Finally, we warn the members of the Hu Feng clique, are you still covering up the crimes of the extremely stubborn counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng, continuing to engage in anti-Party activities, and being enemies of the people? Or are you thoroughly exposing Hu Feng, criticizing yourselves, approaching the Party and the people, and starting a new life? The time has come for you to choose your path. The former is a dead end, and the latter is a bright road.

　　Letter from Air Force soldiers Li Shinong and six others: Although we are not literary and art workers, we are revolutionary soldiers of the people. We finished reading the second batch of materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party clique with unparalleled anger. This more thoroughly exposed Hu Feng's consistent counter-revolutionary behavior. After liberation, he attacked the Party even more cunningly. He carried out the most shameless insults to our great Party, calling the Party Central Committee the "Board of Directors," wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, destroying the Party's literary and artistic policy everywhere, and attacking progressive writers inside and outside the Party rampantly. All these facts clearly prove that his counter-revolutionary crimes are unforgivable.
　　We fully support the resolution of the Joint Enlarged Meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, and suggest dealing with the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary element.

　　Letter from People's Liberation Army soldier Li Zifang: I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. After reading the materials on the Hu Feng anti-Party clique in the "People's Daily", I felt extremely angry. From those secret letters, we completely saw through Hu Feng's sinful activities of opposing the Party, opposing the people, and counter-revolution. Hu Feng, who extremely hated the Party and hated the people, adopted all despicable tricks, took destructive measures like saboteurs sent by imperialism and traitors who surrendered to imperialism, and consistently carried out his counter-revolutionary activities in a planned way. However, Hu Feng's sinful activities were finally exposed by the people and the Party. The Party defeated his rampant attack. This really made us clap our hands and cheer.
　　The people cannot lightly forgive a person like Hu Feng, who has consistently hated the Party, slandered the people, insulted the revolution, stolen information, destroyed revolutionary organizations, and hoped for the restoration of the counter-revolutionary regime. He should be punished by the laws of the country.
　　Our country is now in a period of transition, and all class enemies are frantically attacking us. We must not be paralyzed at any time, and we must keep our eyes wide open to guard against all open or hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

　　Letter from People's Liberation Army soldier Liu Fenghua: I am a soldier, and the responsibility the people give me is to strike the enemy and eliminate the enemy. When I saw the materials on the Hu Feng anti-Party clique revealed in the "People's Daily", a flame of anger immediately ignited in my heart, like a gloomy bunker in front of me pricking my eyes. I couldn't wait to get rid of it in one fell swoop...
　　I also saw that the sharp tips of the pens of many comrades who care about the construction of our motherland are like countless sharp knives, piercing the dark heart of Hu Feng, the leader of the anti-Party clique. Comrades, aim at our enemy – Hu Feng – and beat him hard. His "My Self-Criticism" is a smokescreen. He wants to use double-dealing tactics to disguise and deceive.
　　Comrades, the sun shines on the earth, illuminating every corner. We must resolutely strip off Hu Feng's two layers of skin, let the sun shine out his true form, and let people see clearly what he is.
　　Be brave! Be even braver! We will never withdraw our troops until the enemy surrenders their guns.

　　Letter from People's Liberation Army soldier Qu Zhenfu: I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. When we find an enemy bunker on the battlefield hindering our advance, we always try every means and even sacrifice our lives to get rid of it. Today, in our revolutionary ranks, we have discovered an anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary bunker like the Hu Feng clique. How can we allow it to continue to exist! This kind of bunker is more dangerous than the bunker on the battlefield, because it can shoot arrows at any time and attack the Party.

　　Letter from People's Liberation Army soldier Xia Cheng: After reading the evidence of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes successively revealed by the Party newspaper, we can no longer suppress the anger in our hearts. Hu Feng, this extremely mad conspirator and ambitious man who hates the Party, hates the people, and hates the revolution, has completely lost the qualifications to be an "engineer of the human soul," and even does not have the qualifications to be a glorious people of the People's Republic of China.
　　Our Party is invincible. Not long ago, the Party thoroughly crushed the anti-Party alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi. This was a great victory in the class struggle during the transition period, and we warmly celebrate this victory. Now, the Party has brought the anti-Party and counter-revolutionary crimes of the Hu Feng clique to the light of day. Hu Feng, the head of this clique, has been expelled from the Chinese Writers Association and removed from all the positions he held. We fully support the resolution of the Joint Enlarged Meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, and we cheer for this victory.
　　We clearly know that our Party and people are very strong, and the open, gun-wielding enemies will never defeat us. The enemy also understands this truth. The Hu Feng anti-Party clique also understands this truth, so they changed their faces, pretended to support the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, saying, "If it were not for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I personally would not be able to find a place to settle down for more than twenty years." They wore the golden shining cloak of Marxism-Leninism and secretly sneaked into the Party, the army, and people's organizations, actively carrying out counter-revolutionary activities. If we do not raise our vigilance and continue to let them do this, we may really be defeated by them!
　　However, the Hu Feng clique, like all reactionary fellows, miscalculated. It is not us who are defeated, but the Hu Feng clique. The Party is vigilant, and the people's eyes are sharp. No matter how cleverly the enemy disguises, they will be exposed. All Hu Feng elements must fully understand this, honestly stand up to criticize themselves, expose Hu Feng, and start a new life.
　　We guarantee to the Party that in today's extremely complex and sharp class struggle, we will definitely practice our skills well, do our work well, hold the gun tighter, and defend the socialist construction of the motherland and the happy life of the people with a hundredfold vigilance. If the enemy dares to touch us, we will not let any of them go back. We also hope that the literary and art circles will make persistent efforts, adhere to the struggle, and completely defeat the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng clique.

　　Letter from Chinese People's Volunteers soldiers Zhang Qijun and Huang Yuanshan: We are volunteers who have just returned from Korea. When we saw the evil activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes successively revealed in the "People's Daily", we were extremely indignant.
　　Hu Feng, this demon, wore the cloak of Marxism, disguised himself as a revolutionary writer, sneaked into the literary and art ranks, and gained the trust of the people. In reality, he used the "tactics of Sun Wukong drilling into the belly" to carry out counter-revolutionary activities and destroy the achievements of the working people. How despicable and shameful this is! How insidious and vicious the means are! Today, he has revealed his true form in front of the people. Hu Feng has completely lost the qualifications to be a Chinese people, let alone be called an engineer of the human soul. We fully support the resolution of the Joint Enlarged Meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association: to expel Hu Feng from the Chinese Writers Association, remove all his positions in the literary and art circles, and suggest revoking his qualifications as a representative of the National People's Congress, and deal with his counter-revolutionary crimes. At the same time, we seriously warn those stubborn elements who follow Hu Feng to quickly bow their heads to the people, "stand up to criticize themselves, expose Hu Feng, and start a new life" in order to gain the leniency of the people. We must raise our political awareness and strictly prevent those enemies who disguise themselves as revolutionaries from sabotaging the revolution and our great cause – socialism.

　　Letter from volunteer convalescent Liu Guixian: Hearing the news on the radio about the expulsion of Hu Feng from the Writers Association and the removal of all his positions in the literary and art circles is really gratifying. We unanimously believe that this resolution is correct. We fully support this resolution.
　　Since reading the second batch of materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party clique published in the "People's Daily", I have been shocked and extremely angry. My angry mood could no longer be suppressed. To what extent did Hu Feng, this villain, hate the Party and the people, and he used the most rude and filthy words to curse and slander Party members and all revolutionary literary and art workers as "flies," "mosquitoes," "robbers," and "liars." May I ask, besides our enemies, who else would do this? What is even more intolerable is slandering our beloved leader Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as a "totem" booklet. Who else would do this besides counter-revolutionary elements? From the revealed materials, we can see Hu Feng's sinister and ugly face. How ferocious and vicious Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people activities are!
　　The materials revealed by the "People's Daily" are the ironclad evidence of Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people activities. This is a fact that Hu Feng cannot deny or refute, no matter how capable he is. Therefore, we firmly demand that he be severely punished.

　　Letter from People's Police Zhang Wenjie: I am a people's police. After seeing the materials revealed in the newspaper about Hu Feng's counter-revolution, I couldn't suppress my indignant mood. For twenty years, Hu Feng has been mixed in the revolutionary literary and art camp. On the one hand, he "smiles with contempt" and "shakes hands and makes peace" with us; on the other hand, he viciously "sharpens my sword and peeks in the direction," waiting for an opportunity to attack us. Isn't Hu Feng a thorough special agent? He has been hiding his hideous face, disguising himself as a "humanitarian" to deceive the people. This is only for his "grand future" – that is, the "comeback" of the counter-revolutionary regime.
　　Hu Feng, your reactionary regime has long been buried by the people, and it will never "come back." Your counter-revolutionary clique has finally been uncovered by the people.
　　I wholeheartedly support the resolution of the Joint Enlarged Meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to expel this bad guy, and suggest submitting the evil conspiracy case of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique to the People's Procuratorate for thorough investigation, clarifying his political background, and letting the people publicly try this culprit.

　　Letter from Wang Chenggao of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Public Security Force: The counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng, who wore a progressive coat, was finally purged from our interior, which is really gratifying.
　　But we cannot be paralyzed. We must continue to raise our vigilance and further strengthen the struggle against the Hu Feng reactionary clique. We should also learn a lesson from this struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, so that we can be vigilant and never let the enemy sneak into our interior to sabotage, deceive, and harm us.
　　We would like to tell those elements who are with Hu Feng, hoping that you will stand with the people and take the bright road of socialism, quickly confess and plead guilty to the people. Your future is still bright. Otherwise, if you choose Hu Feng's path, you will have to roll away with Hu Feng. The people's interior does not want those guys who eat the people's food but do things against the people.
　　The exposure of Hu Feng's anti-Party facts further proves that the class struggle in the transition period is sharp and complex. If we are not careful, we will be taken advantage of by the enemy. Therefore, as soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Public Security Force who defend socialist construction, we must always be vigilant and not allow the conspiracies of all counter-revolutionary elements who sabotage our construction to succeed, in order to protect the happy life of the people.

　　Letter from demobilized soldier Wang Shiyi: I am a demobilized soldier. When I saw the anti-Party materials of Hu Feng revealed in the "People's Daily", I felt extremely angry!
　　Everything proves that Hu Feng is a long-term anti-revolutionary element who has penetrated into the revolutionary literary and art camp, pretending to be progressive, but in fact is a thorough and resolute enemy of the people. The Party and the people's policy towards counter-revolutionary elements is: the chief culprit must be punished, the coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded. Therefore, our treatment of this chief anti-revolutionary element Hu Feng should be to adopt the policy that the chief culprit must be punished, and we must resolutely suppress him; the counter-revolutionary clique led by Hu Feng must also be completely crushed!

　　Letter from demobilized soldier Lei Changsheng: I gritted my teeth and clenched my fists tightly, and finished reading Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique". I was really angry! At that time, I wanted to write an article to express my contempt for this insidious enemy, Hu Feng. However, my education level is low, and I can't write, so I had to take the newspaper to show the comrades around me, so that everyone can recognize Hu Feng's ugly face and not be fooled or deceived by him again.
　　Today, I finished reading the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique", and the anger in my heart could no longer be suppressed! I had to write a few words to express my anger at Hu Feng.
　　Hu Feng used the banner of "organizer of literary work standing around the Party" to carry out anti-Party and anti-people conspiracy and criminal activities. He viciously slandered the CCP Central Committee as the "Board of Directors" and Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as a "totem" booklet. He cursed Party member writers and progressive writers outside the Party as "flies," "mosquitoes," "petty bourgeois"... Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people criminal activities also adopted the most despicable double-dealing methods: openly, "don't touch it" and "where possible, follow" the Party and the people; but secretly, he intensified the "sharpening of my sword and peeking in the direction" and "using the tactics of Sun Wukong drilling into the belly" to carry out counter-revolutionary activities and adopt "heart-digging warfare" to destroy the revolutionary cause. Look, how insidious Hu Feng is! What is the difference between him and Hu Shi?
　　Judging from Hu Feng's secret letters, Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people activities were organized, planned, and consistent. It was by no means a matter of ideology, nor was it a matter of "petty-bourgeois revolutionary nature and position," but a political conspirator, the mortal enemy of the people! Conspirator Hu Feng, you have slandered the Party enough, you have slandered the people enough, you have cursed progressive writers enough. Today, the liberated people have eyes like microscopes, and they have completely seen your face. They will no longer be deceived by you and will settle your crimes! We want to shout loudly to Hu Feng and those who follow Hu Feng: Honestly bow your heads and confess your guilt to the people!
　　Our revolutionary victory was won by the blood and sacrifice of thousands of martyrs. Our socialist cause will never allow anyone to sabotage it. We must take all measures to safeguard our cause. Although I am a demobilized soldier, I am always ready to return to the front line to safeguard the people's cause. Whenever I recall the life of the old society, how much I cherish the happiness of today! How much I hate the enemies of the people! Our revolutionary ranks will never allow the existence of people who endanger the revolution.

### 战士们要求挖掉反革命堡垒

专栏：

　　战士们要求挖掉反革命堡垒
    解放军战士贾国策等六人来信：我们是祖国的保卫者——人民解放军战士，为保卫已经取得和将要取得的革命事业，我们进行着艰苦的斗争。对于伪装的胡风反党集团的罪行，我们是不能容忍的。我们完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团及中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，把反党集团的领导者和组织者胡风，从革命阵营内清洗出去，并建议给予严厉的法律制裁！
    从“人民日报”先后揭露的胡风集团的材料看，二十年来，胡风及其集团一贯进行着反党、反人民、反革命的罪恶活动；解放以来，胡风集团反党的组织更加扩大了，向党的进攻更加猖狂了。这是不难理解的，因为革命事业的每一胜利，就意味着反革命分子的加速灭亡；革命愈加深入，反革命分子的反抗愈加猖狂。请看胡风是多么仇恨革命的胜利啊！当我们为全国即将解放而欢呼的时候，他却感到“苦闷”，像“带上了枷”，这也不奇怪，因为劳动人民被解放，就是给反革命分子带上了枷。而他对于我们的缺点和错误，又是何等的幸灾乐祸啊！
    胡风集团的反革命活动就是为了他们的“未来”。谁都会知道，反革命分子所希望的“未来”就是反革命政权的复辟和人民政权的倒台，而这又是美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮所希望的。由此看来，胡风反党集团和特务组织有什么两样呢？
    胡风集团的被揭发，证明了党中央领导的正确。这是社会主义革命过程中阶级斗争的一个重大胜利。同时，我们应该从此记取教训，加倍地提高警惕，不让敌人利用我们的缺点和错误找到进攻的空子。
    最后，我们警告胡风集团分子，你们还是掩护极端顽固的反革命分子胡风的罪恶，继续进行反党活动，与人民为敌呢？还是彻底揭露胡风，批判自己，靠近党和人民，重新做人？到了你们抉择道路的时候了。前者是死路，后者是条光明大道。
    空军战士李世农等七人来信：我们虽不是文艺工作人员，但我们是人民的革命战士，我们以无比愤怒的心情看完了关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料，这更彻底地暴露了胡风的一贯反革命的行为。解放后他更为狡猾地向党进攻。他对我们伟大的党进行了最无耻的侮辱，称党中央为“董事会”，披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，到处在破坏党的文艺方针，向党内外进步作家猖狂进攻。这一切事实都明确地证明了他反革命的罪恶是不可饶恕的。
    我们完全支持中国文学艺术界联合会主席团与中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，并建议给胡风反革命分子以处理。
    解放军战士李子芳来信：我是人民解放军的战士。读了“人民日报”关于胡风反党集团的材料以后，感到万分愤怒。从那些密信里，我们完全看穿了胡风反党反人民反革命的罪恶活动。极端敌视党，敌视人民的胡风，采取了一切卑鄙的伎俩，采取了像帝国主义派进来的破坏分子，和投降帝国主义的叛徒一样的破坏手段，一贯地有计划地进行着他的反革命活动，但是，胡风的罪恶活动，终于叫人民，叫党给揭穿了。党击败了他的猖狂进攻。这真叫我们拍手称快。
    像胡风这样一贯地敌视党，污蔑人民，辱骂革命，窃取情报，破坏革命组织，并希望反革命政权复辟的分子，人民是不能轻轻地饶了他的，应该叫他受国家法律制裁。
    我国现在正处在过渡时期，一切阶级敌人，都在疯狂地向我们进攻。我们时刻也不能麻痹，必须把我们的眼睛擦的雪亮，防备着一切公开的或是暗藏的反革命分子。
    解放军战士刘凤华来信：我是一个兵，人民给我的责任就是打击敌人，消灭敌人。当我看到“人民日报”揭露的胡风反党集团的材料时，我心里立刻燃起了愤怒的火焰，就像面前有一座阴森森的碉堡一样刺着我的眼睛，我恨不得一家伙干掉它……
    我也看到，我们关心祖国建设的许多同志的锋利的笔尖，就像无数把尖刀一样，插入反党集团的首领胡风胶黑的心脏。同志们，要瞄准我们的敌人——胡风，狠狠地揍。他的“我的自我批判”是放出的烟幕弹，他是想用两面派的手段进行伪装和欺骗的。
    同志们，阳光普照着大地，照亮了每个角落。我们要坚决地扒掉胡风的二层皮，让阳光照出他的原形，让人们清清楚楚地看看他是什么东西。
    勇敢些！再勇敢些！敌人不交枪，我们决不收兵。
      解放军战士屈振夫来信：我是人民解放军的一个战士。当我们在战场上发现敌人的暗堡阻碍我们前进时，总是要想一切办法甚至牺牲性命去干掉它。今天在我们革命队伍里，发现像胡风集团这样反党反人民反革命的暗堡，怎能允许它继续存在下去呢！这种暗堡比战场上的暗堡更加危险，因为它随时可以射出暗箭，向党进攻。
      解放军战士夏诚来信：当我们阅读了党报先后揭发的胡风反革命的罪证以后，再也抑制不住心头的愤怒了。胡风，这个极端疯狂的仇恨党、仇恨人民、仇恨革命的阴谋家、野心家，已根本丧失了作为一个“人类灵魂的工程师”的资格，甚至，连做一个光荣的中华人民共和国的人民的资格也没有了。
      我们的党是不可战胜的。不久以前，党彻底粉碎了高岗、饶漱石的反党联盟，这是过渡时期阶级斗争的一个伟大胜利，我们热烈欢呼这个胜利。现在，党又把胡风集团反党反革命的罪行拉到了光天化日之下。这个集团的首脑胡风已被开除出中国作家协会，撤销了他所担任的一切职务。我们完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，我们为这一胜利欢呼。
    我们清楚地知道：我们的党和人民是十分强大的，公开的、拿枪的敌人永远也打不败我们。敌人同样明了这一真理。胡风反党集团也明了这一真理，于是他们改头换面，假装拥护革命，拥护中国共产党，说什么“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的”。他们披着金光闪耀的马克思列宁主义外衣，偷偷地钻到党内、军内、人民团体内，积极地进行着反革命活动。如果我们不提高警惕，继续让他们这样下去，倒真有被他们打败的危险！
    然而，胡风集团和一切反动家伙一样，他们的算盘打错了。打败的不是我们，而是胡风集团。党是有警惕性的，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，不管敌人伪装得如何巧妙，都是要被揭发出来的。一切胡风分子都必须充分认识这一点，老老实实地站出来批判自己，揭露胡风，重新做人。
    我们向党保证：在阶级斗争十分复杂尖锐的今天，我们一定练好本领，做好工作，更紧地握住枪杆，百倍警惕地保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫人民的幸福生活。如果敌人胆敢来碰一碰，就叫他一个也回不去。我们也希望文艺界再接再厉，坚持斗争，把反革命的胡风集团彻底打垮。
    中国人民志愿军战士张奇俊、黄元山来信：我们是刚从朝鲜回来的志愿军战士，当我们看到“人民日报”陆续揭露的关于胡风反党、反人民、反革命的罪恶活动，我们是无比愤慨的。
    胡风这个恶魔，披着马克思主义的外衣，把自己装扮成为一个革命作家，钻到文艺队伍内，骗取人民的信任。而实际上却是“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”来进行反革命活动，破坏劳动人民的成果，这是多么卑鄙可耻呀！其手段又是多么阴险恶毒呀！今天他在人民的面前原形毕露了。胡风已完全丧失了做一个中国人民的资格，那就更称不起人类灵魂的工程师了。我们完全拥护和支持中国文学艺术界联合会主席团及中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议：开除胡风中国作家协会的会籍，撤销他在文艺界所担任的一切职务，建议撤销他全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并对他的反革命罪行进行处理。同时我们严重地警告追随胡风的那些顽固分子，应赶快向人民低头，“站出来批判自己，揭露胡风，重新做人”，以取得人民的宽大。我们要提高政治警觉性，严防那些伪装革命的敌人来破坏革命，破坏我们伟大的事业——社会主义。
    志愿军休养员刘贵贤来信：在广播中听到关于开除胡风作家协会的会籍和撤销他在文艺界的一切职务的消息，真是大快人心。我们一致认为这个决议是正确的。我们完全拥护这个决议。
    自从看了“人民日报”发表的关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料后，真是感到触目惊心，气愤已极。我愤怒的心情再也无法抑止得住了。胡风这个恶棍、仇恨党和人民到了什么地步，竟用最粗暴最龌龊的言词咒骂和污蔑党员和一切革命文艺工作者为
  “苍蝇”“蚊子”“强盗”和“骗子”。试问除了我们的敌人以外，再能有谁这样呢？更令人不能容忍的是污蔑我们敬爱的领袖毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”为“图腾”的小册子，这除了反革命分子以外，谁还会这样呢？从揭发的材料中可以看到胡风阴险丑恶的嘴脸。胡风进行反党反人民的活动是多么凶恶和毒辣呀！
      “人民日报”所揭露的材料，就是胡风反党反人民的铁证。这是胡风有天大的本领也无法抹煞和抵赖的事实。因此我们坚决要求严厉惩办他。
    人民警察张文杰来信：我是个人民警察。我看到了报纸揭发胡风反革命的材料后，抑止不住愤慨的心情。二十年来，胡风一直混在革命文艺阵营内部，一面用“微笑包着侮蔑”和我们“握手言欢”；一面恶毒地“磨我的剑，窥测方向”，等待时机，向我们进攻。胡风还不是一个地道的特务分子吗？他一直隐藏着狰狞的面目，伪装什么“人道主义者”欺骗人民，这只不过是为了他的“远大未来”——即反革命政权的“卷土重来”。
      胡风，你的反动政权早已被人民给埋葬掉了，它再也不会“卷土重来”，你的反革命集团，终于被人民破获了。
    我热诚地拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，开除这坏家伙，并建议把胡风的反革命集团的罪恶阴谋案，提交人民检察院彻底查究，弄清他的政治背景，让人民公审这个罪魁。
    解放军公安部队某部王承诰来信：披着进步外衣的反革命分子胡风，终于从我们内部被清洗出去，真是大快人心。
    可是我们还不能麻痹。我们必须继续提高警惕，进一步加强对胡风反动集团的斗争。我们更应从这次对胡风反革命集团的斗争中吸取教训，从而警觉起来，决不能再让敌人钻到我们内部来破坏、欺骗和危害我们。
    我们愿告诉那些和胡风一道的分子，希望你们站在人民一起走社会主义的光明大道，赶快坦白交代，向人民低头认罪，你们的前途还是光明的。反之你们选择了胡风的路，那只好让你们和胡风一起滚蛋。人民内部决不要那些吃人民的饭却干着反人民的事的家伙。
    胡风的反党事实的被揭发，更证明了过渡时期的阶级斗争是尖锐的复杂的，如稍不警惕就会被敌人钻了空子。因此作为保卫社会主义建设的人民解放军公安部队的战士，我们就更要时刻提高警惕，不让一切破坏我们建设的反革命分子的阴谋得逞，来保护人民的幸福生活。
      转业军人王士毅来信：我是一个转业军人，当我看到“人民日报”所揭发的胡风反党材料以后，感到极大愤怒！
    一切证明：胡风是一个长期打入革命文艺阵营，伪装进步，实际上却彻头彻尾坚决与人民为敌的首恶反革命分子。党和人民对于反革命分子的政策是：首恶必办，胁从不问，立功者受奖。因此，我们对待这个首恶反革命分子胡风的处理应该是采取首恶必办的政策，要坚决地把他镇压下去；对于胡风所领导的反革命集团也必须彻底粉碎！
    转业军人雷长生来信：我咬紧牙关，双手紧紧地握着拳头，看完了舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”，我实在愤怒！当时，我就想写稿表示对胡风这个阴险敌人的唾弃。但是，我的文化低，不会写，只得拿着报纸给我周围的同志看，让大家认清胡风的丑恶嘴脸，再不上他的当，受他的骗。
    今天，我又读完了“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”，我内心的愤怒再也抑止不住了！不得不写几句，表示我对胡风的愤怒。
    胡风打着“站在党的周围的文学工作的组织者”的招牌，进行反党反人民的阴谋罪恶活动。他恶毒地污蔑中共中央是“董事会”，毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”是“图腾”的小册子。咒骂文艺界的党员作家和党外进步作家是“苍蝇”
  “蚊子”、“市侩”……。胡风反党、反人民罪恶活动还采取了最卑劣的两面派手法：公开的是“不要去碰它”，“可能的地方还要顺着”党和人民；而暗中却更加紧地“磨我的剑，窥测方向”、“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，来进行反革命活动，采取“挖心战”来破坏革命事业。看，胡风是多么的阴险啊！他与胡适有啥区别呢？
    从胡风的密信看，胡风反党、反人民是有组织、有计划进行的，是一贯的，决不是什么思想问题，也决不是什么“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”问题，而是一个政治阴谋家，是人民的死敌！阴谋家胡风，党被你污蔑够了，人民被你污蔑够了，进步作家被你咒骂够了。今天，解放了的人民有着显微镜似的眼睛，彻底看清了你的嘴脸，再不受你欺骗，要清算你的罪行！我们要向胡风和跟着胡风跑的人大喝一声：老老实实地向人民低头认罪吧！
    我们的革命胜利成果是千千万万的烈士流血牺牲换来的，我们的社会主义事业决不容许任何人破坏，我们要采取一切措施维护我们的事业。我虽然是个转业军人，但随时都准备重上前线维护人民的事业，每当我回忆旧社会的生活时，我是何等地珍惜幸福的今天啊！何等地憎恨人民的敌人啊！我们革命队伍里决不容许存在有危害革命的人。
