Comrades and friends:
　　In recent days, our whole country has been preparing to celebrate May 9th, on which day our people will commemorate the tenth anniversary of the glorious Soviet army's liberation of Czechoslovakia.
　　Thanks to the historic victory of the Soviet army in defeating Hitler's Germany, Czechoslovakia was liberated from Nazi tyranny and has become a truly free and independent country, in which the working people, led by their own Communist Party, have taken the decisive power into their own hands.
　　For ten years, on the basis of the great development of the people's creativity and with the fraternal, selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, we have not only eliminated the serious consequences caused by the war and Nazi occupation, but also brought the development of our country's economy, especially industry, to an unprecedented level in our history. Thanks to the developed industry and planned economy, the unemployment that often plagued the working people in the old capitalist republic has long disappeared. The system of exploiting the working people has also been eradicated. Every working person is paid according to their labor. The people's cultural living standards are rapidly improving year by year.
　　Czechoslovakia has become a strong component of the world peace camp. It has consolidated its friendly alliance with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic, and other people's democratic countries. The Czechoslovak people actively participate in all movements for peace and strive to better safeguard the freedom and independence of their motherland.
　　After being liberated in the spring of 1945, the new Czechoslovakia received a completely destroyed industry that had been used by the Nazi bandits for military production. The industrial production level at that time was less than 50% of the pre-war level, and the production level of many important production sectors was even lower. In addition, many large and important factories were completely destroyed by the US Air Force in the last few months of the war, while these factories no longer played a decisive role for the already defeated Hitler's Germany.
　　Thanks to the boundless enthusiasm and creative labor of the Czechoslovak working people, the serious wounds brought about by the war and occupation were quickly eliminated. During the two-year plan to restore the national economy, from 1947 to 1948, Czechoslovakia's industry had been restored, and industrial production had already exceeded the pre-war level. During the implementation of the first national economic construction five-year plan, industrial production achieved further vigorous development. The first five-year plan (1949-1953) stipulated that industrial production should be increased by 98% compared to 1948, to ensure the transformation and construction of industry, and to ensure the development of heavy industry, especially the machine manufacturing industry. After completing the first five-year plan, our workers, foremen, and technicians can proudly say that they not only increased industrial production by 98% as stipulated in the plan, but also increased it by 102.2%. More importantly, the unfavorable contrast that existed in Czechoslovak industry in the past has been fundamentally changed, that is, heavy industry has gained an advantage. The production of means of production has been significantly increased. The production of machine industry alone has increased more than threefold.
　　Compared with the last year of the first five-year plan, 1953, and 1937, electricity production increased from 4.1 billion kilowatt-hours to 12.4 billion kilowatt-hours; coal production increased from 16.7 million tons to 20.3 million tons; lignite production increased from 18 million tons to 34.4 million tons; pig iron production increased from 1.7 million tons to 2.8 million tons; cast steel production increased from more than 2.3 million tons to 4.4 million tons. If industrial production is calculated per capita, then at the end of 1953, Czechoslovakia's coal production ranked ninth in the world, pig iron production ranked seventh, and steel production ranked sixth.
　　It must be emphasized here the important economic transformation process carried out in Slovakia. During the bourgeois republic period, the Czech bourgeoisie tried to turn Slovakia into a region supplying food to the Czech Republic and a source of cheap labor for Czech capitalists and landlords. After the Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia, a brand new situation emerged. Following the Leninist-Stalinist national policy, the Czechoslovak Communist Party emphasized that the Czech and Slovak peoples should enjoy equal rights. The principle of equality between the two nations has been fixed in the Czechoslovak constitution. The realization of this principle has transformed Slovakia from a backward agricultural region into an industrial and agricultural region during the five-year plan period. At the end of 1953, Slovakia's industrial output had increased to four and a half times the industrial output of the republic before the Munich Agreement.
　　In agriculture, Czechoslovakia has also achieved great success. During the land reform period, landless peasants and small and medium-sized farmers obtained more than 4 million hectares of arable land. During the implementation of the first five-year plan, great changes took place in the countryside. Most farmers realized that taking the road of large-scale agricultural cooperative production is the only way to a happy life. They also realized that only in this way can yields be increased, the sown area expanded, and agricultural technology fully utilized in production. The transition from individual small-scale production to cooperative large-scale production has begun. The increase in the number of unified agricultural cooperatives during the first five-year plan proves this. At the beginning of the five-year plan, there were only twenty-eight advanced agricultural cooperatives, but by the end of the five-year plan, there were 6,502.
　　With the development of the national economy, the living and cultural standards of the working people are constantly improving. At the end of the five-year plan, the average wage of industrial workers increased by 56% compared to 1948, while the average wage of all staff increased by 47%. The policy implemented by the government and the party aimed at gradually reducing the prices of daily necessities played a decisive role in improving the people's living standards. The currency reform implemented in June 1953 greatly consolidated the market value of the Czechoslovak koruna. After the currency reform, the retail prices of agricultural and industrial products have been reduced four times.
　　The reduction in prices accelerated the circulation of retail goods. For example, the circulation of retail goods in 1954 increased by 20% compared to 1953. At present, the working people can buy items that they could not enjoy in the past. During the first five-year plan, the working people purchased 144,000 sewing machines, 748,000 bicycles, 947,000 radio receivers, 138,000 motorcycles, etc.
　　In the ten years after liberation, great achievements have also been made in culture. The Constitution of the Czechoslovak Republic guarantees every citizen the right to education. The new Czechoslovakia now has 40 institutions of higher learning, with approximately 49,000 students, of which 11,000 are female. There are also 22,000 working people studying in higher education institutions, studying using special methods that do not detach them from their work. If we point out that during the Czechoslovak bourgeois republic period, there were only nine institutions of higher learning and 19,000 students in the entire country, then the above facts become even clearer. That is to say, the number of higher education students has almost tripled.
　　Higher education students receive comprehensive assistance from the government. More than 20,000 students live in state-subsidized student dormitories. 56% of higher education students receive state scholarships. In 1954, the state expenditure on scholarships was 118 million koruna, but during the bourgeois republic period, only 9 million koruna were allocated for scholarships each year.
　　The increase in the number of cinemas and theaters, as well as the increase in the number of audience members, also proves the improvement in cultural standards. Eight hundred and sixteen new cinemas were built during the five-year plan period. At the end of 1954, the Czechoslovak Republic had a total of 3,450 fixed cinemas and approximately 250 mobile film projection teams. In 1954, these cinemas screened approximately one million films, with an audience of 150 million people, an increase of 7% compared to 1953. In addition to state cinemas, many organizations and groups also have their own 6,356 film projectors for screening various types of films such as technical films, educational films, and feature films. The situation in theatrical art is the same. Czechoslovakia has a total of 64 theaters. In 1954, these theaters staged approximately 25,000 performances, with an audience of almost 12 million people.
　　In order for Czechoslovakia to continue to develop, we need peace. The Czechoslovak people are fully aware that there is a force in the world that is trying to hinder the victorious advance of the countries of the peace camp, including Czechoslovakia. Our people also clearly know that this force is deliberately intensifying the international tension, is engaged in a frenzied arms race, and is threatening with atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. The various conspiracies of the new war instigators have met with the fierce resistance of the Czechoslovak people and have strengthened the Czechoslovak people's determination to dedicate all their strength to the cause of defending peace. The Czechoslovak people have actively and increasingly widely participated in various movements aimed at easing international tensions and consolidating world peace. In 1951, more than 9 million people in Czechoslovakia signed the Berlin Declaration of the World Peace Council calling on the five major powers to conclude a peace pact; this year, approximately 9.5 million citizens signed the World Peace Council's declaration against atomic and hydrogen weapons. The Czechoslovak people are not just signing declarations. While collecting signatures, they have also launched a widespread movement initiated by the working people to individually or collectively establish conventions to increase production and reduce costs.
　　The Czechoslovak people are deeply convinced that it is useless to pray for peace. The Czechoslovak people are not appealing for peace out of fear. They are clearly aware of the strength of their own motherland. They are clearly aware that this strength has been growing rapidly in the past ten years. At the same time, they also clearly know that they must rely on selfless labor to continue to consolidate the strength of their motherland.
　　In their creative labor, the Czechoslovak working people have received help from the examples of the Soviet Union and the experience of the Soviet people. The Czechoslovak working people realize that the reason why the Soviet Union was able to repel and eliminate the attack of the Hitler bandit gang, which was armed by the whole of Europe, was because the Soviet Union had built and consolidated its economy, especially its industry, with the greatest selflessness during several glorious five-year plans. The fact that the Soviet Union has even tripled the strength of its basic economic sectors after World War II is a great encouragement to the Czechoslovak people. The Czechoslovak people understand that the people's democratic countries have enhanced their strength by implementing various economic plans, and, like Czechoslovakia, are determined to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union to safeguard and defend peace. The Czechoslovak people know that the people of the German Democratic Republic, who are waging a tenacious struggle for German unification, and millions of peace-loving people around the world are unitedly rising up to fight for peace, and that no one and nothing can stop them in this struggle.
　　The Czechoslovak people are particularly pleased that the People's Republic of China, with a population of 600 million, has become a powerful ally of peace-loving forces in the world. China is no longer isolated and helpless, no longer a puppet exploited and oppressed by foreign imperialism and arbitrarily manipulated by foreigners. China has broken free from a century of slavery and stood up. Today, it is striding towards a happy future. China has been respected and loved by peace-loving people all over the world. China's international prestige is increasing day by day. Together with the Soviet Union, it has become the strongest force in the peace camp. The Czechoslovak people are filled with great and sincere feelings of friendship for the exemplary heroism shown by the Chinese people in their struggle for freedom and independence, and for the selflessness and heroic labor they have shown in building their motherland. The Czechoslovak people regard every achievement of the People's Republic of China as an achievement of their own country and feel sincerely happy. This phenomenon is entirely natural, because the people of our two countries are connected by common aspirations, common ideas, and common goals. This goal is to defend peace and build our own countries into strong, prosperous, and happy countries!
　　On this basis, close friendly relations have developed between our two countries, which are manifested in many equal agreements and treaties concluded for the welfare of both countries. The commodity exchange between our two countries has been actively carried out, and the scope of commodity exchange is expanding year by year. This commodity exchange, like our country's commodity exchange with other countries in the peace camp, not only promotes the smooth and rapid development of the national economies of our two countries, but also powerfully combats the US policy of economic discrimination and economic blockade against the countries of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp. The scientific and technological cooperation agreement has the same task. According to this agreement, our two countries exchange experiences in science and technology, and provide each other with materials and technical data related to production processes, etc., free of charge.
　　The cultural cooperation agreement between Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of China has played a huge role in developing the friendly relations between the two countries. According to this agreement, our two countries send cultural delegations and performing arts groups to each other, and exchange books, sheet music, and other cultural treasures. This work has greatly promoted mutual understanding between the people of our two countries and deepened and consolidated the friendship between the people of our two countries, thereby helping our joint efforts to defend peace and build socialism. Our people are truly filled with love for the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people. In any case, our people always strive to maintain and support all the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China. Our people firmly demand that the People's Republic of China should occupy its rightful and legitimate place in the United Nations, because they know that the participation of the People's Republic of China in this organization will help promote the resolution of many major international issues and the easing of international tensions.
　　The Czechoslovak people condemn with anger the provocative actions of the US ruling clique and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang, who are attempting to launch a war of aggression against the People's Republic of China. Taiwan and other Chinese islands undoubtedly belong to the People's Republic of China. However, at present, US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang are using Taiwan and other Chinese islands to provoke the People's Republic of China. Regarding this issue, the Czechoslovak people completely and absolutely support the right of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and other Chinese islands.
　　We are convinced that the friendship and cooperation between the Czechoslovak people and the People's Republic of China is based on the friendship and cooperation between our two countries and the Soviet Union and other countries in the peace camp. This friendship and cooperation between our two countries is a force sufficient to crush the evil plan of US imperialism and its accomplices to launch a new world war, and it is also a force that guarantees the victorious construction of socialism in our two countries.
　　Long live the ever-developing and consolidating Czechoslovak-Chinese friendship, which will enhance the welfare of the people of both countries!
　　Long live Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, the excellent son and wise leader of the Chinese people, who is creating happiness for the Chinese people!
　　Long live the ever-consolidating world peace camp, headed by our common friend, the great Soviet Union!
　　Long live world peace!

### 捷克斯洛伐克大使格里哥尔的讲话（摘要）

　　捷克斯洛伐克大使格里哥尔的讲话（摘要）敬爱的同志们和朋友们：
    最近这些日子，我们全国正在准备庆祝五月九日，在这一天，我国人民将纪念光荣的苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克的十周年。
    由于苏军取得了战败希特勒德国的历史性的胜利，捷克斯洛伐克从纳粹的暴政下获得了解放，并已成为了一个真正自由和独立的国家，在这个国家里，以在自己共产党领导下的工人阶级为首的劳动人民已经把决定性的权力掌握在他们自己的手里。
    十年来，在人民创造力获得大大发展的基础上，在苏联兄弟般的、无私的援助下，我们一方面消灭了因战争和纳粹占领所造成的严重后果，同时并使我国经济的发展，特别是工业的发展，达到了我国历史上前所未有的水平。由于工业的发达以及有计划性的经济，旧的资本主义共和国时期所有的那种经常打击劳动人民的失业现象早已消逝而不复返了。剥削劳动人民的制度也被肃清了。每一个劳动人民都按照自己的劳动取得报酬。人民的文化生活水平正在迅速地逐年提高。
    捷克斯洛伐克已成为世界和平阵营的一个坚强的组成部分。它巩固了与苏联、中华人民共和国、德意志民主共和国以及其他人民民主国家的友好同盟关系。捷克斯洛伐克人民积极地参加了一切争取和平的运动，并尽力来更好地保障他们祖国的自由和独立。
    在一九四五年春季获得解放以后，新的捷克斯洛伐克接收了被纳粹匪徒用作军事生产的完全破坏了的工业。当时的工业生产水平不及战前水平的百分之五十，而许多重要生产部门的生产水平还要更低。此外，许多规模巨大的重要的工厂，在战争的最后几个月中被美国空军全部炸毁，而当时这些工厂对于已经溃败的希特勒德国是早已不起什么决定性的作用。
      由于捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的无限的热情和创造性的劳动，战争和占领所带来的严重创伤很快就被消除了。在恢复国民经济的两年计划期间，即一九四七年至一九四八年，捷克斯洛伐克的工业已被恢复了起来，工业生产就已超过了战前水平。在实行第一个全国经济建设的五年计划期间，工业生产获得了进一步的大力的发展。第一个五年计划（一九四九至一九五三年）规定要使工业生产比一九四八年提高百分之九十八，要保证工业的改造和兴建，要保证重工业，特别是机器制造工业的发展。在完成了第一个五年计划以后，我国工人、工长和技术人员可以引为自豪的是，他们不仅把工业生产按照计划所规定提高了百分之九十八，并且把它提高了百分之一百零二点二。更重要的事实是，捷克斯洛伐克工业中过去所有的那种不利的对比已根本改变，即重工业改占了优势。生产资料的生产有了显著的提高。仅机器工业生产就提高到三倍以上。
    以第一个五年计划的最后一年，一九五三年和一九三七年相比，电力生产由四十一亿瓩小时增加到一百二十四亿瓩小时；煤的产量由一千六百七十万吨增加到二千零三十万吨；褐煤的产量由一千八百万吨增加到三千四百四十万吨；生铁的产量由一百七十万吨增加到二百八十万吨；铸钢的产量由二百三十多万吨增加到四百四十万吨。如果把工业生产按人口单位计算的话，那末，在一九五三年年底，捷克斯洛伐克的煤的产量占世界第九位，生铁的产量占第七位；钢的产量占第六位。
    这里必须着重指出在斯洛伐克所进行的重要的经济改造过程。在资产阶级共和国时期，捷克资产阶级力图把斯洛伐克变成捷克的供给粮食的地区和捷克资本家及地主们获得低廉劳动力的来源。苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克以后，出现了一个崭新的情况。遵循着列宁、斯大林的民族政策，捷克斯洛伐克共产党强调指出，捷克人民和斯洛伐克人民应享有平等权利。两个民族平等的原则已在捷克斯洛伐克的宪法里固定了下来。这一原则的实现使得斯洛伐克在五年计划期间内由一个落后的农业地区变成了一个工农业的地区。在一九五三年年底，斯洛伐克的工业产量比慕尼黑协定以前的共和国的工业产量已增加到四倍半。
    在农业方面，捷克斯洛伐克也获得了巨大的成就，在土地改革时期，无地农民和中小农民获得了四百万公顷以上的耕地。在实行第一个五年计划的期间，农村中发生了巨大的变化。大部分农民认识到，走大规模的农业合作生产的道路就是走向幸福生活的唯一道路。他们也认识到，只有这样，才能提高收获量，扩大播种面积，并充分地在生产方面运用农业技术。由个体小农生产过渡到合作社的大规模生产已经开始。统一农业合作社数量在第一个五年计划期间内的增加就证明了这一点。在五年计划开始时，只有二十八个高级的农业合作社，但是到五年计划的末期，已有了六千五百零二个。
    随着国民经济的发展，劳动人民的生活和文化水平也在不断提高。在五年计划末期，产业工人的平均工资比一九四八年增加了百分之五十六，而所有职员的平均工资则增加了百分之四十七。政府和党所执行的旨在逐步降低日用品价格的政策，在提高人民的生活水平方面起了决定性的作用。一九五三年六月实行的币制改革，大大地巩固了捷克斯洛伐克的克朗的市价。在币制改革以后，农产品和工业品的零售价格已减低了四次。
    物价的降低加速了零售商品的流转。例如，一九五四年的零售商品的流转就比一九五三年提高了百分之二十。目前劳动人民能够买到过去他们所享受不到的物品。在第一个五年计划期间，劳动人民购买了十四万四千台缝纫机，七十四万八千辆自行车，九十四万七千架无线电收音机，十三万八千辆摩托车，等等。
    解放后的十年中，文化方面也取得了巨大的成就。捷克斯洛伐克共和国的宪法保证每一公民都有受教育的权利。新的捷克斯洛伐克现有四十所高等学校，学生约有四万九千人，其中女生占一万一千人。在高等学校学习的还有二万二千名劳动人民，他们采用特别的方法学习，与他们的工作并不脱节。如果我们指出，在捷克斯洛伐克资产阶级共和国时期，全国只有九所高等学校和一万九千名学生的话，那末，上述事实就更显得清楚明白了。这就是说，高等学校的学生人数差不多增加到三倍。
    高等学校的学生得到了政府的全面帮助。二万名以上的学生居住在国家津贴的学生宿舍里。百分之五十六的高等学校学生获得了国家奖学金。一九五四年国家支出的奖学金款项为一亿一千八百万克朗，但是在资产阶级共和国时期每年拨充奖学金的款项只达九百万克朗。
    电影院和剧院数目的增加，以及观众人数的增加，也证明了文化水平的提高。在五年计划期间内建筑了八百一十六个新电影院。一九五四年年底，捷克斯洛伐克共和国共计有三千四百五十个固定的电影院和二百五十个左右的电影巡回放映队。在一九五四年内，这些电影院约计放映了一百万场电影，观众达一亿五千万人次，比之一九五三年增加了百分之七。除了国家电影院以外，许多机关团体还有自备的六千三百五十六部电影放映机，以供放映技术影片、教育影片和故事片等各种影片的使用。戏剧艺术方面的情形也是相同的。捷克斯洛伐克共有六十四个剧院。在一九五四年内，这些剧院共计约上演了二万五千场戏，观众差不多达一千二百万人。
    为了使捷克斯洛伐克能够继续发展，我们需要和平。捷克斯洛伐克人民完全意识到，世界上有一种势力企图阻遏包括捷克斯洛伐克在内的和平阵营各国的胜利前进。我国人民同时也清楚知道，这种势力正在故意加剧国际的紧张局势，正在进行疯狂的军备竞赛，正在以原子弹和氢弹进行威胁。新战争挑拨者的种种阴谋碰到了捷克斯洛伐克人民的激烈反抗，并使得捷克斯洛伐克人民加强了他们把自己一切力量献给保卫和平事业的决心。捷克斯洛伐克人民积极地并越来越广泛地参加了旨在缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平的各种运动。一九五一年，捷克斯洛伐克有九百多万人在世界和平理事会要求五大国缔结和平公约的柏林宣言上签了名；今年又约有九百五十万个公民在世界和平理事会关于反对原子武器和氢武器的宣言上签了名。捷克斯洛伐克人民不只是在宣言上签名，他们在征集签名的同时，还在劳动人民的发起下展开了一个个人或集体订立增加生产和降低成本的公约的广泛运动。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民深信，祈求和平是没有用的。捷克斯洛伐克人民不是因为害怕才呼吁和平，他们清楚地意识到自己祖国的力量，他们清楚地知道，在过去十年中，这种力量已在突飞猛进地增长起来；同时，他们也清楚地知道，必须依靠忘我的劳动来继续巩固自己祖国的力量。
    捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民，在自己创造性的劳动中，从苏联的范例和苏联人民的经验得到了帮助。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民意识到，苏联过去之所以能够击退由全欧武装起来的希特勒匪帮的进攻并消灭了他们，就是因为苏联在几个光荣的五年计划期间曾以最大的忘我精神建设并巩固了自己的经济，尤其是工业。苏联在第二次世界大战后把自己经济基本部门的实力甚至提高到三倍，这一事实对于捷克斯洛伐克人民乃是极大的鼓舞力量。捷克斯洛伐克人民明白，人民民主各国由于实现了种种经济计划，已经增强了自己的力量，并像捷克斯洛伐克一样，决心与苏联并肩站在一起来维护和保卫和平。捷克斯洛伐克人民知道，为争取德国统一而进行顽强斗争的德意志民主共和国人民，以及全世界千百万爱好和平的人民正在一致奋起进行争取和平的斗争，而在这一斗争中，是没有任何人和任何事物能够阻遏住他们的。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民特别感到愉快的是：拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国已成为世界上爱好和平的力量的强大同盟。中国已不是孤立无援的了，已不是一个受外国帝国主义剥削和压迫、并由外国人一手任意摆布的傀儡了。中国已经摆脱了百年来的奴役而站立起来，它今天正在大踏步地走向幸福的未来。中国已受到全世界爱好和平的人民的尊敬和爱戴。中国的国际威信已在一天一天地提高，它和苏联在一起成为和平阵营中的最强大的力量。捷克斯洛伐克人民对于中国人民在争取自由和独立斗争中所表现的模范的英雄主义，以及他们在建设祖国中所表现的忘我精神和英勇劳动，满怀着伟大和真诚的友谊的感觉。捷克斯洛伐克人民对于中华人民共和国的每一成就，都看作是他们自己国家的成就一样而感到衷心的愉快。这种现象，完全是出乎自然的，因为我们两国人民是以共同的愿望、共同的思想和共同的目标联系起来的。这一个目标就是：保卫和平并使自己的国家建设成为一个强大、富裕和幸福的国家！
    在这种基础上，我们两国之间发展了密切的友好关系，这种友好关系表现在为谋两国福利而缔结的许多平等的协定和条约上。我们两国之间的商品交换已活跃地开展起来，商品交换的范围正在逐年扩大。这种商品交换，正如我国与和平阵营其他各国的商品交换一样，不仅促进了我们两国国民经济的顺利和迅速的发展，而且有力地打击了美国对和平、民主和社会主义阵营各国所采取的经济歧视和经济封锁的政策。科学技术合作协定也有着同样的任务。根据这个协定，我们两国互相交流着科学和技术方面的经验，并无代价地互相供给有关生产过程方面的材料和技术资料等等。
    捷克斯洛伐克和中华人民共和国之间的文化合作协定在发展两国友好关系方面起了巨大的作用。根据这一协定，我们两国相互派遣文化代表团和文工团，并交换书籍、乐谱、以及其他文化珍品。这项工作大大地促进了我们两国人民之间的相互了解，并加深和巩固了我们两国人民之间的友谊，从而有助于我们为保卫和平和建设社会主义的共同努力。我国人民真正地满怀着对中华人民共和国和中国人民的热爱。在任何情况下，我国人民总是尽力维护并支持中华人民共和国的一切合法权利。我国人民坚决地要求，中华人民共和国应该在联合国中占着它所应有的合法的地位，因为他们知道，中华人民共和国的参加这一组织，将有助于促进国际间许多重大问题的解决和国际间紧张局势的缓和。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民怀着愤怒的心情，谴责企图对中华人民共和国发动侵略战争的美国统治集团和蒋介石卖国匪帮的挑衅行动。台湾和其他中国岛屿，毫无疑义是属于中华人民共和国的。但是，目前美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国匪帮却利用台湾和其他中国岛屿向中华人民共和国进行挑衅。关于这一问题，捷克斯洛伐克人民完全地、绝对地支持中国人民解放台湾及其他中国岛屿的权利。
    我们确信，捷克斯洛伐克人民和中华人民共和国人民之间的友好和合作，是以我们两国与苏联以及和平阵营其他各国的友好和合作为基础的，我们两国之间的这种友好与合作，乃是足以粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶发动新世界大战罪恶计划的一种力量，同时也是保证我们两国胜利地建成社会主义的一种力量。
    增进两国人民福利的、日益发展和巩固的捷中友谊万岁！
    为中国人民创造幸福的、中国人民的优秀儿子和英明领袖、中华人民共和国主席毛泽东万岁！
    以我们共同的朋友——伟大的苏联为首的、日益巩固的世界和平阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
