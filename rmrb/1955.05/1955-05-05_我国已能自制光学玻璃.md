China Can Now Produce Its Own Optical Glass

China is now capable of manufacturing optical glass. To date, the Instrument Museum of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has produced twelve types of optical glass.

The furnaces and various equipment required for manufacturing this optical glass were all designed and built independently by China.

Optical glass is used for the lenses of all optical instruments and must be extremely uniform, transparent, free of bubbles, colorless, and have specific optical properties. In the past, China's optical glass was all imported from foreign countries.

The Instrument Museum of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has successfully trial-produced a batch of precision optical instruments and is gradually expanding production to meet the needs of national industrial construction, cultural education, and health undertakings.

This batch of optical instruments includes methanometers to ensure the safety of coal mine production; several instruments necessary for geological exploration and capital construction; as well as biological microscope lenses, cystoscope lenses, and movie projector lenses. After inspection, their quality has been proven to be very good.

The experts and workers at the Instrument Museum overcame extremely difficult technical problems in manufacturing these optical instruments. They created special tools to grind lenses with extremely complex shapes; during a delicate adjustment process, they conducted hundreds of experiments before achieving success.

　  我国已能自制光学玻璃
    我国已能制造光学玻璃。到现在为止，中国科学院仪器馆已制成十二种光学玻璃。
    制造这些光学玻璃所需的炉窑和各种设备，都是我国自行设计建设的。
    光学玻璃是做一切光学仪器镜头用的，质地必须十分均匀、透明、无气泡、无色，并须具有一定的光学性能。过去，我国所用的光学玻璃都是从外国输入的。
    中国科学院仪器馆试制成功一批精密的光学仪器，并已逐步扩大生产，以满足国家工业生产建设和文化教育卫生事业等方面的需要。
    这批光学仪器中，有保证煤矿安全生产的沼气检定计；地质勘探和基本建设所必需的若干仪器以及生物显微镜镜头、膀胱镜镜头、电影放映机镜头等。经过检验，证明它们的质量都很好。
    仪器馆的专家和工人们在制造这些光学仪器时曾克服了十分困难的技术问题。他们创造了特别的工具来研磨形状极复杂的镜片；在进行一项精细的装校工作时，他们曾反复作了上百次的试验，才获得成功。　（据新华社讯）
