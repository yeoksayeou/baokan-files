Anhui Province Builds Twenty-Seven New Pumping Stations

Anhui Province has built twenty-seven new pumping stations this year, installing a total of more than 4,000 horsepower pumps. Currently, the canal projects for the twenty-seven pumping stations have been largely completed, and the engineering structures are generally more than 50% complete, with some nearing completion. The Qinqiao station in Feidong County, Tiancheng圩 station in Wuhu County, Huangbod渡 station in Huoqiu County, Xiaohekou station in Binghui County, and Yuanqiang District station in Taihe County, which have made faster progress in construction, can be completed and officially tested by the end of May. The remaining stations can also complete all projects by June or July.

After the completion of these twenty-seven pumping stations, Anhui Province will have a total of thirty-five pumping stations, and the benefited farmland will increase from more than 100,000 mu last year to more than 300,000 mu. Many drylands in the benefited areas will be converted into paddy fields, and single-season rice can be converted into double-season rice.

　  安徽新建二十七座抽水机站
    安徽省今年新建二十七座抽水机站，安装的抽水机共有四千多马力。目前，二十七座抽水机站渠道工程已大部完成，工程建筑物一般完成百分之五十以上，有些已接近完工。建站工程进度较快的肥东县秦桥、芜湖县天成圩、霍邱县黄泊渡、炳辉县小河口、太和县原墙区等站，在五月底可以全部竣工，正式试水。其余各站到六、七月间，也可以完成全部工程。
    这二十七座抽水机站全部完工后，安徽省共已有三十五座抽水机站，受益农田将由去年十万多亩增加到三十万多亩。受益地区的许多旱地将可改为水田，一季稻可改为双季稻。
