　　越南人民军准备接管海防市
    新华社河内十一日电　越南人民军已经准备好在五月十三日接管海防市。人民军的先遣行政工作队和先遣警察队已经分别在五日和九日进入海防市。同时人民军部队正冒着炎热的天气向海防市郊进军。进军部队通过新解放地区人民搭起来的一个个的彩门，这时，拥在道路两旁的人们高声欢呼，很多穿着白色衣裙的少女和儿童把一束束鲜花和彩色纸屑掷向人民军的行列。
    越南民主共和国政府为了保证海防解放后对市民的物资供应，已经用火车、汽车、小型轮船、汽艇等从各地把数千吨大米、二百吨糖和食盐以及大量纱布、煤油、纸张等日用品运到海防附近地区。数以千计的接管干部也正在准备进入海防市，他们不久以前曾集中学习了关于接管海防市的各项政策。来自各地的文工团、电影放映队随着部队前进，他们准备在海防解放后马上为当地人民举行慰问演出。
    从海防来的消息说，海防居民几乎每家都缝制了金星红旗，准备欢迎人民军部队。
