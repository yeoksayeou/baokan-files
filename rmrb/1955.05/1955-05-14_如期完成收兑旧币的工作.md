　　Complete the Work of Recalling Old Currency as Scheduled
　　Zhang Hong
    Old Renminbi notes of 5,000 yuan and below will cease to be redeemable from June 11th. Currently, some bank cadres have developed a lax attitude towards the publicity and exchange work for recalling old currency. Consequently, in remote areas, ethnic minority regions, and some rural areas, many people are still unaware of the deadline for recalling various old currency notes of 5,000 yuan and below. Some farmers mistakenly believe the Gregorian calendar date of the deadline is the lunar calendar date, and some people are completely unaware that there is a deadline for recalling old currency.
    In order to complete the work of issuing new currency and recalling old currency as scheduled, the lax attitude should be corrected, and publicity should continue. Especially in rural areas, remote areas with inconvenient transportation, and ethnic minority regions, publicity work should be strengthened to mobilize the masses holding various old currency notes of 5,000 yuan and below to exchange them on time.
    When publicizing the exchange deadline, attention should be paid to the local people's customs. For example, for ordinary farmers, the lunar calendar date of the deadline should be explained when publicizing the recall deadline.
    When publicizing the exchange method, it should be explained that everyone can go to any exchange institution to exchange the currency themselves. If it is believed that self-exchange will delay work or production, the village government, trade union, and other organizations can also collect the old currency of 5,000 yuan and below held by everyone and go to the nearest People's Bank of China or agent exchange institution for exchange.
    When publicizing why the recall should be limited in time, it should be explained that a limited-time recall is beneficial to the country and the people. If two currencies are allowed to circulate simultaneously for a long time, it will be inconvenient for calculation and use, and errors can easily occur, which may cause confusion in currency circulation, which is detrimental to the people's economic life.
    As long as all regions continue to work hard to promote and recall the currency, the work of recalling old currency will definitely be completed on time.

　　如期完成收兑旧币的工作
　　张红
    五千元和五千元以下的旧人民币将在六月十一日起停止收兑。目前由于某些银行干部对收兑旧币的宣传和兑换工作产生了松懈思想，因而在偏僻地区、少数民族地区和部分农村中，还有很多人不知道五千元和五千元以下各种旧币的收兑期限，有的农民把收兑期限的公历日期误认为阴历，有些人还根本不知道收兑旧币还有限期的规定。
    为了如期完成发行新币收兑旧币的工作，应纠正松懈思想，继续进行宣传。特别是农村和交通不方便的边远地区，以及少数民族地区，更应加强宣传工作，动员持有五千元和五千元以下各种旧币的人民群众按时进行兑换。
    宣传兑换期限时，应注意当地群众习惯，如对一般农民，应在宣传收兑期限时说明期限的阴历日期。
    宣传兑换方法时，要说明每个人都可以自己到任何兑换机构去换。如果认为自己兑换会耽误工作或生产，也可以由村政府、工会等组织把大家存有的五千元和五千元以下的旧币集中起来，到就近的人民银行或代兑机构去兑换。
    宣传为什么要限期收兑时，要说明限期收兑对国家和人民都有好处。如果长期让两种货币同时流通，在计算和行使上都会感到不方便，容易发生错误，可能使货币流通发生混乱，这对人民的经济生活是不利的。
    只要各地继续努力进行宣传和收兑，收兑旧币的工作一定是能按时完成的。
