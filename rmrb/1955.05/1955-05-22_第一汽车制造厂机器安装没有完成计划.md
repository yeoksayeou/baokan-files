First Automobile Works' Machine Installation Fails to Meet Plan
　　Hong Lin
　　The civil engineering and construction peak at the First Automobile Works has passed, and the machine installation task is becoming increasingly urgent. However, in the first quarter of this year, the First Automobile Works only completed 52 percent of its installation plan. In April, the first month of the second quarter, only 21 percent of the quarterly plan was completed. The situation is very serious.
　　Unrealistic planning is an important reason for the failure to complete the task. When formulating the first quarter plan, they discovered that more than 100 machines had not arrived. However, the factory leaders did not consider this and instead thought that they could install more than 600 machines in one month last year; installing only more than 400 machines in the three months of the first quarter would not be a problem. In fact, by the end of the first quarter, 152 machines had not yet been delivered. Four machines had not even been ordered, and even the design drawings had not arrived. Such an unrealistic plan is of course impossible to complete.
　　Why couldn't the machines arrive? As early as last winter, the leaders of the First Automobile Works proposed that one of the keys to completing this year's installation task was to do a good job in equipment supply. However, the leaders responsible for this work adopted a passive attitude of waiting for the machines to arrive, neither requesting assistance from higher authorities nor sending people to the manufacturing departments to supervise and inspect, resulting in the failure of machines that should have arrived to arrive on time.
　　The failure to do a good job in the supply of machinery and equipment is one aspect of the failure to complete the installation task. On the other hand, the machines that have arrived and have been delivered to the installation department have not been completely installed. This is the result of the blind optimism and slackening of effort that exists from top to bottom at the First Automobile Works. In particular, the leading staff members thought that the task was completed once the plan was drawn up, the targets were set, and the tasks were assigned. They neither took concrete measures to achieve the plan, nor explained the tasks to the masses, let alone how to mobilize the masses to ensure the completion of the plan. On the contrary, they allowed a large number of employees to take leave and go home, resulting in a situation where workers could not be found when it was necessary to rush to work.
　　The construction project of the First Automobile Works is carried out with civil engineering construction, machine installation, and pipeline engineering intertwined. However, the leadership's thinking was blindly optimistic, and they did not sufficiently estimate the difficulties of cross-construction, nor did they promptly put forward requirements for civil construction, material supply, and pipeline installation. As a result, civil construction exceeded the task every month, but could not meet the needs of installation, and some projects even delayed the progress of the installation work. For example, the forging workshop was originally planned to start installing machines in mid-February, but because the civil construction was not completed, the installation personnel did not enter the site until March 10. In the chassis workshop, because the wooden floor was not laid, more than 50 machine tools were transported to the site but could not be installed. The phenomenon of material supply and pipeline engineering conflicting with machine installation is particularly serious. In many places, the transportation roads were destroyed due to the installation of pipelines, and machinery and equipment could not be transported to the site; sometimes, in order to install machines, some civil construction projects were forced to stop; and sometimes, because of the installation of overhead cranes, the installation of machines and pipeline engineering were affected. This has created a chaotic situation of mutual collisions, mutual influences, mutual buck-passing, and mutual shirking of responsibility, which has seriously affected the completion of the machine installation task.
　　At the beginning of the second quarter, the First Automobile Works conducted an inspection of the situation of not completing the installation plan and put forward some improvement measures. It was decided to educate all employees to recognize the seriousness of not completing the plan, and to require everyone to establish the view that civil construction should be subordinate to installation, and installation should be subordinate to production needs. In the future, when inspecting the completion of the plan, not only should it be checked whether the economic indicators have been completed, but also whether the engineering projects have been completed. It was also decided to transfer cadres to the factories manufacturing machinery and equipment to supervise and inspect the manufacturing situation and help overcome technical difficulties in equipment manufacturing; for machinery and equipment that cannot be solved by themselves and require the responsible department at a higher level to supervise and purchase, a list should be drawn up and reported to the ministry and bureau for assistance. Finally, the leaders responsible for machine installation work explained to the employees the situation and reasons for not completing the installation plan in the first quarter, mobilized the masses to discuss the installation plan for the second quarter, checked the installation conditions, and mobilized the masses to supervise the implementation of the plan.
　　Despite this series of measures, the installation project in the second quarter has not improved significantly. The First Automobile Works has a large amount of machine installation this year, and whether the installation task can be completed according to plan will directly affect the time the factory is put into production. Therefore, all employees of the automobile factory need to put in more effort to speed up the progress and try to make up for the tasks that were not completed in the first quarter.

　　第一汽车制造厂机器安装没有完成计划
　　红林
    第一汽车制造厂的土木建筑高潮已经过去，机器安装任务越来越紧迫。但是，今年第一季度第一汽车厂的安装计划只完成了百分之五十二。第二季度的头一个月——四月，也只完成了季度计划的百分之二十一。情况是很严重的。
    计划不切合实际，是任务没有完成的重要原因。他们在编制第一季度计划时，就发现有一百多台机器没有来到。但厂的领导人员没有考虑这些，反以为去年一个月就能安装六百多台机器；第一季度三个月只安装四百多台，没有问题。事实上，直到第一季度末，还有一百五十二台机器没有交付。有四台机器还没有订货，甚至连设计图纸也没有到。这种不合实际的计划当然无法完成。
    为什么机器不能到呢？早在去年冬天，第一汽车厂的领导人员就曾提出：完成今年安装任务的关键之一是搞好设备供应。但负责这项工作的领导人员，却采取了坐等机器到来的消极态度，既没有请求上级帮助，也没有派人到承制部门督促检查，结果使本来应该来到的机器也没有按时来到。
    机器设备的供应工作没有做好，是没有完成安装任务的一个方面。另方面，已经到来、并且交付给安装部门的机器，也没有安装完毕。这是第一汽车厂从上到下存在着盲目乐观情绪和松劲思想的结果。特别是领导工作人员，自以为计划订好了，指标下达了，任务就算完成了。既没有采取实现计划的具体措施，又没有向群众交代任务，更谈不到如何发动群众来保证完成计划。相反的，却准许了大批职工请假回家，结果到需要抢工突击的时候，竟发生了找不到工人的现象。
    第一汽车厂的建设工程，是土木建筑、机器安装和管道工程交叉进行的。但是领导思想上盲目乐观，没有足够估计交叉施工的困难，没有及时提出对土建、材料供应、管道安装方面的要求，结果土建月月超额完成任务，却不能满足安装的需要，有若干工程反而推迟了安装工作的进度。像锻工场原计划二月中旬开始安装机器，因土建没有完工，安装人员直到三月十日才进入现场。在底盘工场，因木块地板没有铺好，使五十多台机床运到了工地不能安装。材料供应、管道工程同机器安装发生冲突的现象尤其严重。不少地方因为安管道，破坏了运输道路，机器设备不能运入现场；有时为了安机器，使部分土建工程被迫停工；也有时因为安天车，影响机器安装和管道工程。这样就造成了相互碰头、相互影响、相互扯皮、相互推卸责任的混乱局面，严重地影响了机器安装任务的完成。
    在第二季度初，第一汽车厂对没有完成安装计划的情况进行了检查，提出了一些改进措施。决定要教育全体职工认识没有完成计划的严重性，要求大家树立土建服从安装、安装服从生产需要的观点。今后检查计划完成情况时，不仅要检查是否完成了经济指标，而且要检查是否完成了工程项目。并且决定抽调干部到承制机器设备的工厂去督促检查承制情况和帮助克服设备制作方面的技术困难；自身不能解决，需要上级负责督促、购置的机器设备，则开列清单，报请部局设法帮助。最后，由负责机器安装工作的领导人员，向职工群众交代第一季度没有完成安装计划的情况和原因，发动群众讨论第二季度的安装计划，查对安装条件，动员群众来监督计划的执行。
    尽管有了这一连串的措施，但是第二季度的安装工程并没有显著改进。第一汽车厂今年的机器安装量很大，能否按计划完成安装任务，将直接影响工厂投入生产的时间。因此汽车厂的全体职工，有必要拿出更大的力量来加快进度，和设法补足第一季度没有完成的任务。
