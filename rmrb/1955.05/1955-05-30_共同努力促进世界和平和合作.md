　　Jointly Striving to Promote World Peace and Cooperation
　　Since the Asian-African Conference, interactions and contacts between relevant countries have increased, and further mutual understanding and friendly relations will also be strengthened. This situation undoubtedly helps to expand the achievements of the Asian-African Conference and consolidate peace in the Asian-African region and the world.
　　Currently, the Chinese people are warmly receiving Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo, the distinguished representative of the Republic of Indonesia. Our honored guest has come to our country with the desire to strengthen friendly cooperation between our two countries. The people of our capital have expressed a grand welcome, enthusiastically cheering the increase in friendship between our two countries. In the past few days, Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo has met with the leaders of our country and government, is making extensive contact with people from all walks of life in our country, and has begun talks with Premier Zhou Enlai. It should be said that this friendly contact is a continuation and development of the joint efforts made by our two countries at the Asian-African Conference for the cause of peace, independence, freedom, and friendship.
　　During the Asian-African Conference, the Indonesian government and people fully demonstrated their sincere desire to resolutely defend peace, safeguard national independence, and promote friendly cooperation among all countries, and made important contributions to the success of the conference. The Indonesian people have every reason to be proud of the role they have played in the cause of world peace. The Indonesian newspaper "Independent" pointed out in its commentary on the Asian-African Conference: "Indonesia is convinced of the strength it can contribute to the security of Asia and the world, and it is now participating in international affairs. Indonesia's contribution to the cause of peace will bring glory to Indonesia and its people." Many Asian and African countries, after breaking free from the shackles of colonialism, have become important forces in maintaining peace, and Indonesia is precisely such a force. There is no doubt that the peaceful efforts of the Indonesian government and people will become an increasingly important factor in maintaining the cause of peace.
　　The achievements of the Asian-African Conference are a milestone in the major development of our Asian-African region during this period. It marks an important step forward for Asian and African countries to strive to promote friendly cooperation relations based on common interests and common aspirations. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in the "Report on the Asian-African Conference":
　　"The Asian-African Conference strengthened the national consciousness of the people of Asian and African countries, promoted mutual understanding between Asian and African countries, and opened up new avenues for international cooperation." The ten principles of peaceful coexistence established by the Asian-African Conference Declaration are of particular significance. These ten principles fully conform to the five principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, and are an extension and development of the five principles. These ten principles stipulate that all countries, regardless of size, should respect each other, cooperate on an equal footing, and live in harmony. This once again points out the direction of efforts for countries willing to live in peace. Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said well in his speech at Premier Zhou Enlai's banquet on the 27th, "The ten principles we recently formulated express the common beliefs and firm views of the two major continents of Asia and Africa. They are not just a declaration, but must be regarded as the rules of life for the people of Asia and Africa, according to which their future relations with each other and with other regions of the world will be based." We believe that if all Asian and African countries strive to use these principles to handle their relations, they will be able to generate and enhance mutual understanding and establish and develop normal relations between them. If these principles can be extended to all international relations, then we will make a great contribution to easing international tensions and maintaining lasting peace in the Asian-African region and the world.
　　The governments and people of our two countries, China and Indonesia, greatly cherish the resolutions and declarations of the Asian-African Conference and are jointly striving to promote their realization. The joint statement between the Prime Ministers of China and Indonesia fully embodies the spirit of the Asian-African Conference Declaration. This relationship between China and India, China and Myanmar, and China and Indonesia has expanded the area of ​​peace and is playing an increasingly important role in the cause of maintaining world peace.
　　There is a broad prospect for further developing friendly cooperation between our two countries in all aspects. As Premier Zhou Enlai said at the banquet welcoming Sastroamidjojo: "At present, the two countries not only have the common desire and demand to defend peace in Asia and the world and maintain their respective sovereignty and territorial integrity, but are also struggling to continue to oppose foreign interference, get rid of economic backwardness, and realize the complete independence of their countries, which constitutes a deep and broad foundation for the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries." We believe that on this basis, through the joint efforts of the governments and people of our two countries, the friendly cooperation between our two countries will surely make greater and greater progress, which not only conforms to the interests of the people of our two countries, but also conforms to the interests of peace in Asia and the world.

　　共同努力促进世界和平和合作
    亚非会议以后，有关各国之间的来往和接触增多了，进一步的互相了解和友好关系也会跟着加强起来。这种情况，毫无疑义是有助于扩大亚非会议的成果，有助于巩固亚非地区和全世界的和平的。
    现在，中国人民正在热烈接待着印度尼西亚共和国的杰出代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理。我们的贵宾带着加强我们两国友好合作的愿望到我国访问，我们首都人民表示了盛大的欢迎，热情欢呼我们两国友谊的增进。这几天来，沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理会见了我国的国家和政府的领袖们，正在同我国各界人士作广泛的接触，并同周恩来总理开始进行会谈。应该说，这种友好接触是我们两国在亚非会议上为和平、独立、自由和友好的事业所进行的共同努力的继续和发展。
    在亚非会议期间，印度尼西亚政府和人民充分表现了坚决保卫和平、维护民族独立和促进各国友好合作的真诚愿望，并对会议的成就作出了重要的贡献。印度尼西亚人民对于他们在世界和平事业中所起的作用，完全有理由感到自豪。印度尼西亚
  “独立报”在评论亚非会议时曾指出：“印度尼西亚确信它自己对亚洲及世界安全方面所能贡献的力量，它现正参与国际事务。印度尼西亚对和平事业的贡献将给印度尼西亚和它的人民带来光荣。”不少亚非国家摆脱了殖民主义枷锁之后，成了维护和平的重要力量，印度尼西亚正是这样一种力量。毫无疑问，印度尼西亚政府和人民的和平努力，将成为维护和平事业中一个日益重要的因素。
    亚非会议的成就，是我们亚非地区这一时期重大发展的里程碑。它标志着亚非各国根据共同利益和共同愿望来努力促进友好合作关系的重要进展。周恩来总理在“关于亚非会议的报告”中指出：
  “亚非会议加强了亚非各国人民的民族自觉，促进了亚非各国之间的互相了解，开辟了国际合作的新的途径。”亚非会议宣言规定的各国和平相处的十项原则，尤其具有重大的意义。这十项原则完全符合于互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处的五项原则，并且是五项原则的引申和发展。这十项原则规定所有国家，不论大小，应该互相尊重，平等合作，和睦相处。这又一次替愿意和平相处的国家指出了努力的方向。沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理在二十七日出席周恩来总理的宴会上的讲话说得好，“最近制定的我们的十项原则表达了亚非两大洲的一致信念和坚定的看法。它们不只是一项宣言，必须把它们看成是亚非人民生活的规章，今后它们彼此的关系和同世界上其他地区的关系将要依据的规章。”我们相信，如果所有亚非国家都努力运用这些原则来处理它们之间的关系，那就能够产生和增进相互的了解，建立和发展它们之间的正常关系。如果这些原则能够推广到所有国际关系中去，那末，我们就会为缓和国际紧张局势，维护亚非地区和世界持久和平，作出巨大的贡献。
    我国和印度尼西亚两国政府和人民都十分珍视亚非会议的决议和宣言，并正在为促进其实现而共同努力。我国同印度尼西亚两国总理的联合声明，就充分地体现了亚非会议宣言的精神。中印、中缅、中国和印度尼西亚之间的这种关系，扩大了和平地区，并在维护世界和平的事业中起着日益重要的作用。
    我们两国在各方面进一步发展友好合作是有着广阔前途的。正如周恩来总理在欢迎沙斯特罗阿米佐约的宴会上所说的：“当前两国不仅具有保卫亚洲和世界和平和维护各自的主权和领土完整的共同愿望和要求，而且正在为继续反对外来干涉、摆脱经济落后、实现国家的完全独立而斗争，这就构成了发展两国友好合作关系的深广基础。”我们相信，在这个基础上，经过我们两国政府和人民的共同努力，我们两国的友好合作一定会取得越来越大的进展，而这不仅符合于我们两国人民的利益，同时也是符合于亚洲和世界和平的利益的。
