    Xinchang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party wrote: The "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily on April 10 criticized the persistence of the "five excesses" phenomenon in our county's rural work, which is consistent with the facts. The County Committee attaches great importance to the reader's criticism, has conducted numerous studies, and is preparing to make specific decisions at the upcoming County, District, and Township three-level cadre conference, to stop unnecessary meetings and abolish unnecessary organizations and systems. This will ensure that cadres and activists have more time to lead production.

    新昌县决定克服五多现象
    中共新昌县委会来信：人民日报四月十日“读者来信专页”批评我县乡村工作中仍然有“五多”现象，是符合事实的。县委会对读者的批评极为重视，曾多次作了研究，并准备在下届县、区、乡三级干部大会上作出具体决定，停止不必要的会议，取消不必要的组织和制度。以便保障干部和积极分子有更多的时间领导生产。
