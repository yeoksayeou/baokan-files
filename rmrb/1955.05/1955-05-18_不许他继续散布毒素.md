　　Don't Allow Him to Continue Spreading Poison
　　Cui Naiying
　　I am an engineer at the Beijing Electric Power Bureau. The publication of Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" and Shu Wu's "Some Materials Regarding the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group" in the People's Daily on May 13th drew my great attention. Comparing these two articles, the issue is very clear: Hu Feng's self-criticism is extremely dishonest. He still refuses to remove his Marxist disguise and make a frank confession to the Party. Shu Wu is someone who no longer wants to blindly follow Hu Feng. He bravely handed over the materials of this anti-Party group, indicating that he is approaching the Party and has embarked on a new path. This is very good and deserves to be welcomed. Everyone who has participated in this anti-Party clique should do the same.
　　Hu Feng still wants to use some clever words to deceive people in order to continue peddling idealistic wares and spreading the poison of bourgeois individualism. He says, "People always have to 'use others to support themselves'," and "All things are complete in me." However, his self-criticism only says that he has "narrow sectarian sentiments" and "self-righteous individual heroism," and even says, "If it weren't for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I personally would not have found a place to settle down in the past twenty years"; but in his letter to Shu Wu, he slandered the Party as "official" and called the comrades in charge of the Party's literary work "officials" and progressive cultural figures "opportunists." This shows that his anti-Party and anti-people literary group has long been hostile, resentful, and hateful of the Chinese Communist Party and non-Party progressive writers. After liberation, Hu Feng continued to engage in this anti-Party activity. In a letter he wrote from Beijing after liberation, he said: "There (referring to the Northeast) is a new area in culture, where you can get rid of all personal relationships and engage in pioneering work, which is probably better than anywhere else." Look! He really wants to expand his influence everywhere. Isn't this clearly exposing his face as an anti-Party careerist?
　　From the materials revealed by Shu Wu, Hu Feng's attitude and stance of opposing and hating the Party are extremely obvious. We must strip off the mask of this hypocrite who pretends to support the Party and not allow them to continue spreading poison.

　  不许他继续散布毒素
    崔乃营
    我是北京市电业局的工程师，五月十三日人民日报发表胡风的“我的自我批判”和舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”引起了我的很大注意。把这两篇文章对照起来看，问题很清楚，胡风的检讨是十分不老实的，他仍然不肯脱去自己的马克思主义者的伪装，向党作坦白的交代。舒芜是一个不愿再跟着胡风瞎跑的人，他勇敢地交出了这个反党集团的材料，表示他是靠近党，已走向新路了，这是很好的，值得欢迎的。曾参加过这个反党小集团的人都应该这样做。
    胡风还想用一些巧妙的词句来欺骗人，以便继续贩卖唯心主义的货色，散布资产阶级个人主义的毒素，他说：“人是总得‘拿别人养活自己的’”、“万物皆备于我”。而他的检讨仅说自己有着“狭隘的宗派情绪”和“自以为是的个人英雄主义”，还说什么“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的”；但他在给舒芜的信里却把党诬蔑为“官方”，把党的负责文艺工作的同志叫做“老爷”，把进步文化人士称为“投机家”，可见他这反党反人民的文艺集团，是老早就敌对、仇视和痛恨中国共产党和非党的进步作家的了。胡风在解放后还继续进行这种反党勾当，在解放后他从北京写出的信说：“那里（按指东北），在文化上是新区，可以摆脱一切人事关系，从事开辟工作，恐怕比任何地方都好。”看！他真是想要到处扩展自己的势力，这不是明显地暴露了他的作为反党的野心家的面貌了吗？
    从舒芜所揭发的材料看，胡风反对党、仇视党的态度和立场，是极为明显的。我们必须剥下这种假装拥护党的伪善者的假面具，不许他们再继续散布毒素。
