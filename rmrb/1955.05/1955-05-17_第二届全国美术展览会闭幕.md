The Second National Art Exhibition, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Artists Association, closed on the 15th.

Since its opening on March 27, the exhibition has been visited by a total of 229,699 people.

Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, Vice-Chairpersons Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, and Shen Junru, Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Chen Shutong, and Vice-Chairmen of the National Defense Council Liu Bocheng and Ye Jianying, among others, visited the exhibition successively.

The audience gave the exhibition a high evaluation. Many exhibits were praised by the audience, who requested that these works be printed and published, and hoped that artists would go deeper into life, further expand the subject matter of their creations, and reflect real life and struggle in more and better ways. The exhibition was also well received by many foreign artists visiting Beijing. The famous Soviet painter and two-time Stalin Prize winner, K.M. Maksimov, who was in Beijing, studied the exhibits and believed that what was particularly valuable was that these art works made people feel the breath of life of the new China. The famous Czechoslovak painter Adolf Hoffmeister was very interested in the exhibition and took many photos of the exhibited works. The Danish painter Bidstrup was particularly interested in the exhibited comic strips and prints.

The exhibition has had a wide impact on the national art community. The Second Meeting of the First National Council of the Chinese Artists Association, held in the capital, is conducting a lively discussion on some issues concerning art creation in conjunction with the works at the exhibition, so that the quality of future creations can be further improved.

The exhibition has attracted attention from all aspects of the capital. The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio produced a color documentary film for the exhibition. The capital's newspapers and periodicals also published many excellent works from the exhibition, as well as reviews and introductory articles about the exhibition.

Some of the works exhibited at this exhibition will be exhibited at the Chinese exhibition of the Fifth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival. After September, a tour exhibition will be held in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Shenyang. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    展览会引起了首都各方面的重视。中央新闻纪录电影制片厂为展览会摄制了色彩纪录片。首都各报刊还发表了展览会上的许多优秀作品、有关对展览会的评论和介绍文章。
