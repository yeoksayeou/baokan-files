　　Advanced Producer Rao Yunfu
　　By our reporter Gu Weijin
    In the winter of 1952, Gucheng County, Hubei Province, held an agricultural labor model conference. Cai Yitian, a special-class labor model, reported at the meeting on his study of the high-yield rice model Chen Yongkang's advanced experience of close-planting with small seedlings. He harvested 1,250 jin of rice per mu of paddy field, exceeding the normal yield by 125 percent. This aroused the concerns of labor model Rao Yunfu.
    Rao Yunfu is from Baiguoshu Township, now in his forties. In the past, he herded cattle for nine years and worked as a long-term laborer for more than ten years. After the land reform, he was allocated land and housing. Because of his enthusiasm for production, he was elected as the head of the mutual aid team and is now selected by the township as a labor model. After listening to Cai Yitian's report, he went to Cai Yitian to study the issue of increasing production. He said, "Our Baiguoshu Township is a dryland crop area with very good soil, mainly producing corn, but the yield is not high. Is it that dryland cannot increase production?" Cai Yitian said, "Paddy fields and drylands are the same in principle; if paddy fields can increase production, drylands can also increase production. More research into cultivation techniques will make it happen!"
    Cai Yitian's words gave Rao Yunfu great inspiration and encouragement. He returned to his township and carefully pondered the secrets of increasing corn production. He remembered that once when thinning corn seedlings, there were a few rows of seedlings with two or three plants per hill, which grew very neatly. He was reluctant to hoe them out and left four rows. Later, each corn plant produced a cob, and each cob weighed about four or five liang. From this, he thought that corn could also be closely planted. If each hill of corn was changed from planting a single seedling to planting double seedlings, implementing double-seedling close-planting, could production not be increased?
    In the spring of 1953, Rao Yunfu was trained in the county's mutual aid training class. When Jin Xing Medal winner Ren Guodong was calculating the increase in production, Rao Yunfu discussed the matter of double-seedling close-planting of corn with people who had cultivation techniques. Everyone believed that this method could increase production and helped him plan how to plant closely and calculate the increase in production: one mu of land could plant 1,800 to 1,900 hills of double seedlings, and the yield could reach 800 to 900 jin, more than double the yield of planting single-seedling corn in the past.
    Rao Yunfu returned to his township and promoted the benefits of double-seedling close-planting of corn to the masses. However, many people did not believe it. Some people said, "Since ancient times, it has been 'sparse grains, large ears.' How can there be double-seedling close-planting?"
    Rao Yunfu considered: If the masses don't believe in double-seedling close-planting of corn, then let's start with my own mutual aid team.
    He was the head of the mutual aid team. At the meeting of the mutual aid team, he asked the members how to increase production.
      "But how can we increase production with an average of seven fen of land per person?" Some team members disagreed.
    "Find the key," Rao Yunfu continued, "Everyone consider, how about double-seedling close-planting of corn?"
    No one spoke. The team members' eyes fell on Yang Changshou. This was an old farmer in his seventies and a production expert in the team. He slowly said, "I've planted corn all my life, and it's not easy to grow single seedlings well. Double seedlings will grow even worse. I think this method is doing good for the cowherds -- when 'slippery stalks' (not producing ears) appear, they can eat sweet corn stalks."
    Someone added, "Not only will 'slippery stalks' appear, but I'm afraid the 'feet will turn yellow' (lacking vigor) before the 'fang qian' (flowering)."
    Rao Yunfu explained to everyone that "slippery stalks" are caused by poorly prepared land, affecting the uneven height of the seedlings, and small seedlings cannot raise flowers; "yellow feet" are caused by insufficient fertilizer, and the seedlings lack energy. Finally, he said, "As long as we pay attention to cultivation techniques and have determination, things will definitely succeed!"
    "It's easy to say, but let's not take this risk," the old man finally disagreed.
    Some young people agreed to experiment with double-seedling close-planting of corn. Yang Changshou's son asked his father to allocate a portion of land for him to experiment with double-seedling close-planting of corn. However, Yang Changshou said, "If you want to learn this new trick, I will pull out the seedlings!"
    The meeting was held several times without results. "What should I do?" Rao Yunfu thought, "Just because some team members don't believe in double-seedling close-planting of corn, does that mean we shouldn't do it? No, I will continue even if I'm the only one! As long as I make a model, I'm not afraid that everyone won't believe it."
    In April, Rao Yunfu implemented double-seedling close-planting of corn on one mu and six fen of land, planning to produce 800 jin of corn per mu. At this time, he suddenly heard a message saying, "Wang Mancai is a 'two hundred and fifty'."
    It turned out that the neighbor Wang Mancai had been trained in the mutual aid training class with Rao Yunfu. When he saw Rao Yunfu implementing double-seedling close-planting of corn, he also tried to plant a portion of land, planning to produce two shi five dou (675 jin) of corn per mu. However, the villagers discussed that one mu of land producing one shi five dou would be good. It was impossible to produce two shi five dou, and it was a mess. So people gave Wang Mancai a nickname -- "two hundred and fifty." Rao Yunfu was uneasy when he heard this. "Wang Mancai plans to produce two shi five dou, and people ridicule him like this. If I publicize my plan to produce 800 jin, won't people ridicule me even more? Besides, if I don't reach the yield of 800 jin in the future, I don't know what kind of joke people will make of me."
    Rao Yunfu's mood was heavy.
    He walked to the cornfield. The seedlings began to emerge, emerging neatly and strongly, better than the seedlings of others. He was secretly happy. He thought, "The seedlings are growing well because I put effort into the technology before sowing, applying enough base fertilizer to each piece of land, plowing it once, harrowing it three times, using the 'morning dew white' improved variety, and implementing warm water soaking... If I continue to put effort into the technology, I will definitely increase production in the future." The seedlings grew very fast, and after weeding for the fourth time, they were already more than four chi high. They grew as lush as those single-seedling corn. The mutual aid team members paid attention to their team leader's corn. Some young team members said: The seedlings are growing so well, there is hope for double-seedling close-planting. Some old team members said: Not necessarily, maybe they only grow leaves and don't raise flowers and bear ears. Rao Yunfu didn't say anything when he heard this, but he had his own views. Since the seedlings came out, he has attached great importance to field technical management: when thinning the seedlings, keep the double seedlings generally the same size, so as not to let the small seedlings catch up with the large seedlings; implement fertilization in stages, combined with weeding; the number of weeding times is more than doubled compared to the past; in order to prevent lodging, a layer of soil is cultivated at the roots of the seedlings... Now the seedlings have grown well, and in the future, with the growth of the seedlings, continue to strengthen field management, what is the problem with corn flowering and bearing ears.
    One sunny morning, Wang, the section chief of the county government, came to Rao Yunfu's cornfield with a camera. He said that it was a gratifying thing that double-seedling corn could grow so well, and he wanted to publicize this matter. Rao Yunfu smiled and watched him take several photos of double-seedling corn. Soon, Comrade Gan from the district committee also came to visit Rao Yunfu's corn. "Deep roots and lush leaves, there is hope!" he praised. "Manage it well, the success or failure of double seedlings is not your own business, but the county's production increase."
    When the corn was about to flower, the weather was dry and there was a pest infestation. The corn leaves in the heart were bitten by insects. The young team members enthusiastically helped Rao Yunfu catch insects. However, no one could find where the insects were. Insects biting the heart of the leaves would affect flowering and bearing ears, and increasing production would be a problem. Rao Yunfu was very anxious. At night, he slept restlessly and was heavy-hearted. He thought of Section Chief Wang taking pictures of the corn, Comrade Gan from the district committee talking, and he also thought of those who ridiculed the improvement of cultivation techniques... It was late at night, he fell asleep and woke up. "No!" he said to himself, "I must find the insects!"
    Rao Yunfu and several young team members worked out a way to catch insects: in the past, insects were caught after the sun came out, but now the time is changed to before the sun comes out. At this time, there is dew, and the insects may come out to drink the dew.
    The next day, as soon as the sky turned white, Rao Yunfu and the young team members went to the cornfield to catch insects. They carefully checked each corn, and the dewdrops on the leaves kept splashing on their faces. Rao Yunfu suddenly saw a shiny thing wriggling at the top of a corn leaf. He quickly wiped the dewdrops between his eyebrows and saw a half-inch long green worm crawling there drinking dew. They looked at the other corn and saw that there were also such worms. When the sun came out, the dew on the leaves gradually dried up, and the insects burrowed into the heart of the leaves and disappeared.
    The team members helped Rao Yunfu catch the insects and helped him carry water to irrigate the land.
    When the corn matured, the villagers went to Rao Yunfu's field to visit. People unanimously praised the corn for growing well: "Double seedlings with big ears, amazing!"
    An old man in his seventies visited very carefully: he sometimes calculated the row spacing of the corn, and sometimes calculated the plant spacing of the corn. He looked at the corn ears and counted the number of plants. It turned out that this old man was Yang Changshou, a production expert in Rao Yunfu's mutual aid team. He had strongly opposed double-seedling close-planting of corn. Now he counted the number of corn plants and said to Rao Yunfu with a smile: "I counted, there are more than four thousand plants, which can bear more than four thousand ears, and I will definitely receive what you said (that is, eight hundred jin). You really did what you said."
    The corn was harvested. Rao Yunfu's corn had an average yield of 835 jin per mu, exceeding the original planned yield by 35 jin, more than double the yield of others.
    The bumper harvest of corn doubled Rao Yunfu's income, how happy he was! But what made him the happiest, in his own words, was "curing the conservative disease." Indeed, since his corn harvest, no one in the township has opposed double-seedling close-planting of corn. Last year, the Gucheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China promoted Rao Yunfu's experience of double-seedling close-planting of corn throughout the county. More than 50 percent of the dryland crop areas in the county implemented double-seedling close-planting of corn. Last year's flood was serious, but the areas that implemented double-seedling close-planting of corn maintained the yield of ordinary years.
    This year, the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture has affirmed Rao Yunfu's double-seedling close-planting of corn as one of the advanced experiences and requires it to be promoted in dryland areas throughout the province.

　　先进生产者饶运富
　　本报记者　古维进
    一九五二年冬季，湖北省谷城县举行了农业劳动模范大会。特等劳动模范蔡以田在会上报告了他学习水稻丰产模范陈永康的小株密植先进经验，一亩水田收了一千二百五十斤稻子，超过常年产量百分之一百二十五。这段话引起了劳动模范饶运富的心事来。
    饶运富是白果树乡人，现年四十多岁，过去放过九年牛，当过十多年长工。土地改革后，他分到了土地、房屋。因为生产积极，他当选为互助组长，现在又被乡里选为劳动模范。听了蔡以田的报告后，他就去找蔡以田，研究增产问题。他说：“我们白果树乡是旱地作物区，土质很好，主要产玉米，但是产量提不高，是不是旱田不能增产呢？”蔡以田说：“水旱田是一理；水田能增产，旱田也一定能增产，多多研究耕作技术就成了！”
    蔡以田的话给了饶运富很大的启发和鼓舞。他回到乡里，细心揣摩玉米增产的窍门。他记起有一次在玉米定苗时，有几行苗子每窝有二、三棵，长的很整齐，舍不得锄掉，留了四行，后来每棵玉米都结了穗，每个穗约有四、五两。从这件事情，他想起玉米也一定能密植，如果每窝玉米由植单苗改为植双苗，实行双苗密植，不是可以增产吗。
    一九五三年春天，饶运富在县互助训练班受训。当学习金星奖章获得者任国栋算增产账时，饶运富把玉米双苗密植的事情同有耕作技术的人研究。大家认为这个方法可以增产，帮助他计划如何密植和算出了增产账：一亩地可以栽植一千八、九百窝双苗，产量可以达到八、九百斤，比过去栽植单苗玉米提高产量一倍多。
    饶运富回到乡里，向群众宣传了玉米双苗密植的好处。但是许多人不相信，有的人说：“自古就是稀谷大穗，哪有双苗密植。”
    饶运富考虑：群众不相信玉米双苗密植，就先在自己互助组里搞起来吧。
    他是互助组长。在互助组的会议上，他向组员提出要怎样才能增产的问题。
      “可是，每人平均七分地怎样增产呢？”有的组员不同意地说。
    “找窍门。”饶运富接着说：“大家考虑，玉米双苗密植怎么样？”
    没有人说话。组员的目光落在杨长寿身上。这是一个七十多岁的老农，组里的生产能手。他慢吞吞地说：“种了一辈子玉米，单苗还不容易长好，双苗越发长不好了。我看这法子是给放牛娃做好事——到时出‘滑秆’（不结穗），他们可以吃甜玉米秆了。”
    有人接着说：“不仅要出‘滑秆’，恐怕不到
  ‘放千’（出顶花）就会黄脚哩。”
    饶运富给大家解释：“滑秆”是地整的不好，影响苗子高矮不齐，小苗扬不起花；“黄脚”是肥料不足，苗子没有劲头。末了他说：“只要讲究耕作技术，有决心，事情一定成功！”
    “说的倒容易，还是不要冒这个险吧。”老年人最后还是不同意。
    有些青年人同意试验玉米双苗密植。杨长寿的儿子就要求父亲划出一部分土地给他试验玉米双苗密植。但是，杨长寿说：“你要学这个新玩艺，我就把苗子拔掉！”
    会议开了几次没有结果。“怎么办呢？”饶运富想，“有些组员不相信玉米双苗密植难道就不搞吗？不，一个人也要搞下去！只要做出样子，不怕大家不相信。”
    四月，饶运富有一亩六分地实行了玉米双苗密植，一亩地计划产玉米八百斤。这时候，他忽然听到一个消息说：“王满才是‘二百五’。”
    原来邻居王满才曾经和饶运富一块在互助训练班受训，他看见饶运富实行玉米双苗密植，也试种了一部分土地，计划一亩地产玉米二石五斗（合六百七十五斤）。乡里人却议论说：一亩地打一石五斗就是好的，要打二石五斗根本不可能，胡闹哩。于是人们送王满才一个绰号——“二百五”。饶运富听到了，不安地想：“王满才计划打二石五斗，人们就这样讽刺他，如果把自己计划产八百斤的数字公开了，人们不是更要讽刺我吗？再说，如果将来达不到八百斤产量，人们不知要笑话成什么样子哩。
    饶运富心情很沉重。
    他走到玉米地里。苗子开始出来了，出的整齐、茁壮，比旁人的苗子都好。他心里暗暗高兴。他想：“苗子长的好，是由于下种以前在技术上下过功夫，每块地上足了底肥，犁了一道，耙了三道，选用了‘露水白’良种，实行了温汤浸种……如果继续在技术上下功夫，将来一定能增产。”苗子长得很快，薅过第四遍草，已经四尺多高了。它同那些单苗玉米长得一样茂盛。互助组员对自己组长的玉米注意起来了。有的青年组员说：苗子长得这样好，双苗密植有希望。有的老年组员说：不见得吧，说不定光长叶子不扬花结穗呢。饶运富听了这话，没有说什么，但是，他是有自己的看法的。自从苗子出来后，他非常重视田间技术管理：定苗时，把双苗留得一般大，免得小苗赶不上大苗；实行分期施肥，并结合锄草；薅草的次数比过去多了一倍；为了防止倒伏，苗根培了一层土……现在苗子已长好了，今后随着苗子的生长，继续加强田间管理，玉米扬花结穗还有什么问题呢。
    在一个天气晴朗的上午，县政府王科长带着照相机来到饶运富的玉米地里。他说双苗玉米能长得这样好真是一件可喜的事，他要把这件事宣传出去。饶运富笑眯眯地看他给双苗玉米拍了几张照片。不久，区委甘同志也来参观饶运富的玉米。“根深叶茂，有希望！”他称赞不已。“要好好管理呵，双苗成不成，不是你一个人的事情，是全县增产的事情。”
    玉米快要扬花时，天气亢旱，又发生了虫害，玉米叶心有的被虫咬坏。青年组员们热情地帮助饶运富捕虫。但是，谁都找不到虫子在什么地方。虫子咬坏叶心会影响扬花结穗，增产就会成问题。饶运富很焦急。夜里，他睡得不稳，心事重重。他想到王科长给玉米拍照片，区委甘同志的谈话，他还想到那些讽刺改进耕作技术的人……。夜深了，他昏昏睡去又醒来。“不成！”他自言自语地说：“一定要把虫子找到呵！”
    饶运富同几个青年组员研究出捕虫的办法：过去捕虫是在太阳出来以后，现在把时间改到太阳出来以前，这时有露水，虫子可能出来喝露水。
    第二天，天刚泛白，饶运富同青年组员到玉米地里捕虫。他们仔细检查每一棵玉米，叶子的露珠不断溅到他们的脸上。饶运富忽然看见一棵玉米叶心的上端有个明晃晃的东西在蠕动，他忙拭去眉间的露珠，只见一条半寸长的青虫爬在那里喝露水。他们再看旁的玉米，也有这种虫。太阳出来了，叶子上露水渐渐干掉，虫子便钻进叶心不见了。
    组员帮饶运富捕掉虫子，又帮他担水浇地。
    玉米成熟时，乡里人都到饶运富的地里参观。人们一致称赞玉米长得好：“双苗大穗，了不得！”
    有个七十多岁的老头参观特别细致：他时而计算玉米的行距，时而计算玉米的株距，他瞅了瞅玉米的穗子，就数起棵数来。原来这老头是饶运富互助组里的生产能手杨长寿，他曾经极力反对玉米双苗密植。现在他数完玉米的棵数，笑眯眯地对饶运富说：“我数了一下，足有四千多棵，能结四千多个穗，一定能收到你说的那个点子（即八百斤）。你真是说到做到了。”
    玉米收割了。饶运富的玉米每亩平均产量是八百三十五斤，超过原计划产量三十五斤，超过旁人的产量一倍多。
    玉米的丰收，使饶运富的收入增加了一倍，他是多么高兴啊！但是，最使他高兴的，照他自己的话说来，就是“治好了保守病。”的确，自从他的玉米丰收后，乡里没有人反对玉米双苗密植了。去年，中共谷城县委在全县推广了饶运富的玉米双苗密植经验。全县有百分之五十以上的旱地作物区实行玉米双苗密植。去年的水灾是严重的，但是，实行玉米双苗密植的地区都保住了平常年景的产量。
    今年，湖北省农业厅已肯定饶运富的玉米双苗密植为先进经验之一，要求在全省旱作地区推广。
