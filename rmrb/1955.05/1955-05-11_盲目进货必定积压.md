Blindly Stocking Up Inevitably Leads to Accumulation
By Our Reporter Chen Ji

    When a commodity is found to be selling well, commercial staff become tense. This tension has a good side, which is to actively ensure supply and meet the needs of the broad masses of the people; but it also has a bad side, which is to ignore market needs, blindly purchase, and accumulate capital. Many heads of commercial departments pay little attention to this bad side, and are often intoxicated by the victorious sound of "completing the task," thus repeating the mistakes that have been made time and time again in the past.
    In the fourth quarter of last year, the Hunan Provincial Food Company and the Hunan Provincial Native Produce Company, based on past experience, judged that cured meat would sell well around the Spring Festival. Both companies drew up plans to vigorously purchase cured meat. However, before and after the purchase, no one understood how much the market needed, and they subjectively believed that "anyway, it is a best-selling product, it doesn't matter if we purchase more." As a result, cured meat poured into Changsha, Hengyang and other places from all over the province and from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, but could not be sold and had to be stockpiled. A total of more than 4.55 million catties of cured meat were stockpiled in the province's warehouses, which was 42.5 percent more than the food company's total sales performance in 1954. The stockpiled cured meat was about to deteriorate with the change of climate. What should be done? They had no choice but to launch a campaign for employees to sell cured meat. If they couldn't sell it in Changsha, they turned back to the places where cured meat was produced. If they couldn't sell it in the province, they hurriedly promoted it outside the province. If they couldn't sell it outside the province, they launched "credit sales" to various agencies and organizations. In order to sell it quickly, they had to continuously lower the price four times and sell it cheaply. The stockpiled cured meat was finally sold, but a large amount of national wealth was wasted. According to preliminary statistics, a total of more than 580,000 yuan was lost.
    Similar incidents of stockpiling cured meat are not isolated in Hunan Province's commercial departments. The Hunan Provincial Pharmaceutical Company, Department Store Company, Chemical Raw Materials Company, Monopoly Company and Retail Company have all experienced varying degrees of stockpiling. Last year, the Hunan Provincial Pharmaceutical Company blindly ordered Rendan and DDT, accumulating 250,000 yuan of capital; this year, it has stockpiled more than 2,000 boxes of X-ray film worth tens of thousands of yuan. The commodities stockpiled by the Hunan Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company are worth more than 2 million yuan. The Hunan Provincial Monopoly Company is stockpiling expensive liquor and a large quantity of beer from several years ago. The Hunan Provincial Department Store Company is stockpiling sewing machines and many harmonicas, ping-pong balls, bicycles, and thermos bottles. The Changsha Retail Company is stockpiling a large amount of charcoal and cotton wool. In addition to stockpiling cured meat, the Hunan Provincial Native Produce Company is also stockpiling 600,000 catties of candy and more than 10,000 dozen milk powder. The candy stockpiled by the Changsha Native Produce Company could be sold for seven or eight years. In order to sell these stockpiled goods, these companies have adopted abnormal methods such as "credit sales," "bundling," and "cross-regional sales," attracting business everywhere and creating market chaos.
    These events show that the commercial system in Hunan Province has blindness in its management. This blindness not only accumulates and wastes a large amount of state funds and affects the turnover of state funds, but also affects the development of industry. Due to the blindness of commercial departments in processing orders, industry in some places has also blindly developed. The Jianxiang Enamel Thermos Bottle Factory blindly produced a large number of thermos bottles that were expensive and of poor quality. Tens of thousands of thermos bottles were stockpiled and could not be sold. Due to the purchase of a large number of toothbrushes by commercial departments from outside the province, Hunan's toothbrush industry is currently difficult to arrange.
    Why do some commercial departments in Hunan Province continue to stockpile goods? Is it because there are too many goods? No. Commodities such as cured meat, candy, milk powder, eggs and X-ray film are not excessive in the country as a whole, but insufficient. When candy was stockpiled in Hunan, Shanghai was short of candy. When cured meat was stockpiled in Changsha, Hunan, some areas of Hunan were short of cured meat. So why is there a stockpile? The main reason is that some commercial departments have capitalist management ideas. The most prominent manifestation of this idea is "whatever commodity sells well, they compete to purchase; whatever commodity has a large profit, they rush to operate."
    Many commercial staff like to seize best-selling goods. They feel that: by seizing best-selling goods, it is easy to complete the sales plan. But they do not understand and study the needs of the people. During this inspection of the cured meat backlog, Chen Chongjian, manager of Hunan Provincial Native Produce Company, said: "I simply don't understand how much cured meat is needed on the market." Sun Leran, manager of Hunan Provincial Food Company, also said: "We only thought cured meat was easy to sell, and didn't ask about market changes; if we had asked a little bit in the beginning, we wouldn't have bought so much cured meat."
    Because they do not understand and study market needs, they often send out a large number of purchasing personnel to grab best-selling goods everywhere. Whoever grabs the most, their work is the best. A purchasing agent can go to other provinces to purchase best-selling commodities at will without the approval of their superiors. Some leaders also praised such purchasing agents for having "initiative." Last October, Hunan Provincial Food Company had purchased more than 2 million catties of cured meat in the province, which was enough to supply the market. However, a business person in the company took it upon himself to give play to "initiative" and asked purchasing agents outside the province to purchase another 550,000 catties of cured meat. The Hunan Provincial Native Produce Company originally did not need to operate cured meat, but seeing that "cured meat sells well," it also formulated a plan to sell 570,000 catties of cured meat. However, when purchasing, they found that the cured meat in Sichuan and Guizhou was cheap, so they broke the original plan and purchased more than 2.3 million catties of cured meat. Such things as grabbing best-selling goods are by no means isolated. The Changsha Monopoly Company found that beer was selling well, so it purchased more than 10,000 boxes from Qingdao and other places. The Changsha Retail Company thought that lard and cotton wool were best-selling goods, and blindly purchased them, occupying too much of the company's funds, and at one time had difficulties in capital scheduling, affecting the supply of other necessities. The reason why some other companies continue to stockpile goods is often because they grab best-selling commodities without a plan.
    Why are these companies so interested in best-selling commodities? Is it to ensure the needs of the people? Not entirely. The stockpiling of many commodities shows that the people in these areas do not currently need so much. Some managers say: "This is to complete the plan." I don't know what plan they are referring to. People only know that the plan of state-owned commerce should both ensure the needs of the people and accumulate funds for the country. Leaving this principle, only wanting to seize more best-selling goods and complete the plan of the unit, without asking about the needs of the people, how can it be considered "completing the plan"? Only caring about purchasing a large amount of best-selling goods, regardless of the accumulation and waste of national funds, what kind of "completing the plan" can that be?
    Under the cover of this "completion of the plan," they also adopted capitalist competition methods to pursue profits, creating artificial tension in the market. The Hunan Provincial Native Produce Company, the Hunan Provincial Food Company, and the Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Union once competed with each other for sources of goods and transportation vehicles in order to purchase certain best-selling goods, and even raised purchase prices. The Changsha Retail Company once discovered that dried bamboo shoots from Fujian were selling well, and purchased all the dried bamboo shoots owned by private merchants in Changsha for unified management, creating a phenomenon of panic buying of dried bamboo shoots in the market. Li Fei, the former manager of this company, raised the price from 1.07 yuan per catty to 2.02 yuan after discovering that everyone was snapping up dried bamboo shoots. Such a purely profit-seeking point of view is obviously very wrong.
    In this cured meat stockpiling incident, the purely profit-seeking point of view that is incompatible with socialist principles was also manifested. Originally, the Hunan Provincial Native Produce Company and the Hunan Provincial Food Company could purchase enough cured meat in the province to ensure the needs of the people. Why did both companies actively send people to blindly purchase from other provinces? The main reason is that the cured meat in Sichuan and Guizhou is cheaper. Some cadres said: "We only thought that the price was cheap and we could make more money, so we bought more." A business executive of the Hunan Provincial Native Produce Company also said: "It takes a lot of effort to get a load of dried radishes and dried vegetables, and only completes a few yuan of the plan; it doesn't take much effort to get a load of cured meat, and it completes seventy or eighty yuan of the plan, and you can get more than 20% net profit." So they desperately purchased it, regardless of market needs and planned management. What is even more serious is that in November of last year and January of this year, some commercial departments outside the province wanted to buy Hunan's cured meat, but the Hunan Provincial Food Company refused to sell it because it was waiting for a "better price." When the cured meat was already stockpiled and had to be sold at a reduced price, some cadres were unwilling, saying, "Why reduce the price? You can sell it at a good price in May." Such a point of view is absolutely not allowed to exist in state-owned commercial departments.
    Some cadres said: "State-owned commerce cannot but accumulate funds for the country!" Yes, state-owned commerce should accumulate funds for the country. The question is how to accumulate funds. As a socialist state-owned commerce, to accumulate funds for the country, it must improve management and reduce circulation costs and accelerate capital turnover in accordance with the state's plan. Blindly stocking up and massive stockpiling can absolutely not accumulate funds for the country.

　　盲目进货必定积压
　　本报记者　陈迹
    当发现一种商品畅销的时候，商业工作人员都紧张起来了。这种紧张情绪，有好的一面，那就是积极保证供应，满足广大人民的需要；但也有坏的一面，那就是不研究市场需要，盲目采购，积压资金。许多商业部门负责人不大注意这种坏的一面，往往陶醉在“完成任务”的胜利声中，因而重犯了过去一再犯过的错误。
    去年第四季度，湖南省食品公司和湖南省土产公司根据以往的经验，判断春节前后腊肉是会畅销的。这两个公司都订出计划，大力收购腊肉。但在收购前后，谁都没有了解市场需要多少，只主观地认为“反正是畅销货，多采购一些也没有关系”。于是，腊肉从省内各地和四川、贵州两省源源涌进长沙、衡阳等地，卖不出去，只好积压起来。全省仓库里一共积压了四百五十多万斤腊肉，比一九五四年食品公司全年销售实绩还多百分之四十二点五。积压的腊肉随着气候的变化，快要变质了。怎么办呢？只好发动职工来个推销腊肉的运动。长沙推销不了，就回过头来向出产腊肉的地方推销。省内推销不了，又赶忙向省外推销。省外推销不了，又向各机关团体发动“赊销”。为着赶快销出去，不得不连续降低四次价格，廉价出售。积压的腊肉好容易推销出去了，但浪费了国家的大量财富。据初步统计，一共损失了五十八万多元。
    类似积压腊肉的事件，在湖南省商业部门不是个别的。湖南省医药公司、百货公司、化工原料公司、专卖公司和零售公司，都程度不同地发生过积压商品的事件。湖南省医药公司去年盲目订购仁丹和滴滴涕，积压了资金二十五万元；今年又积压了两千多盒价值好几十万元的爱克斯光软片。湖南省化工原料公司积压的商品竟值两百多万元。湖南省专卖公司积压着好几年前的名贵的酒和大批啤酒。湖南省百货公司积压缝纫机和许多口琴、乒乓球、自行车、热水瓶等。长沙市零售公司积压大批木炭、棉絮。湖南省土产公司除了积压腊肉而外，还积压了六十万斤糖果和一万多打奶粉。长沙市土产公司积压的糖果，可卖七八年之久。这些公司为了销售这些积压的商品，采用了“赊销”“搭配”和“越区推销”等等不正常的办法，到处招揽生意，造成市场的混乱。
    这些事件说明湖南省商业系统在经营管理上有盲目性。这种盲目性不但积压和浪费国家大批的资金，影响国家资金的周转；而且影响工业的发展。由于商业部门加工订货的盲目性，有些地方的工业也跟着盲目地发展起来。建湘搪瓷热水瓶厂盲目生产大量热水瓶，价钱贵，质量差。积存好几万个热水瓶卖不出去。由于商业部门向省外采购了大批牙刷，目前湖南的牙刷业不好安排。
    为什么湖南省有些商业部门不断地积压商品呢？是因为商品过多吗？不是的。像腊肉、糖果、奶粉、鸡蛋和爱克斯光软片一类的商品，在全国来说，不是过多，而是不足。在湖南积压糖果的时候，上海糖果就不够供应。当湖南长沙积压腊肉的时候，湖南某些地区还缺少腊肉。那么为什么会积压呢？主要是因为有些商业部门存在着资本主义经营思想。这种思想最突出的表现，就是“什么商品好销，就争着采购；什么商品利润大，就抢着经营”。
    许多商业工作人员都喜欢抓畅销货。他们觉得：抓了畅销货，容易完成销售计划。他们却不了解和研究人民需要的情况。在这次检查腊肉积压事件时，湖南省土产公司经理陈崇鉴说：“我根本不了解市场上究竟需要多少腊肉”。湖南省食品公司经理孙乐然也说：“我们只想到腊肉好销，没过问市场变化情况；如果当初稍微过问一下，也不会采购这样多的腊肉。”
    由于他们不了解和研究市场需要情况，他们经常派出大批采购人员，到处乱抓畅销货。谁抓得多，谁的工作就最好。一个采购员可以不通过上级的批准，随随便便到省外去采购畅销的商品。有些领导人还夸奖这样的采购员有“主动精神”。去年十月湖南省食品公司已在本省购进两百多万斤腊肉，已能够供应市场需要了。但公司里的一位业务人员自作主张，发挥“主动精神”，要省外采购员再购进五十五万斤腊肉。湖南省土产公司本来不必要经营腊肉，但眼看“腊肉好销”，也拟定了销售五十七万斤腊肉的计划。可是，在采购的时候，发现四川、贵州的腊肉便宜，于是就打破原订计划，购进了二百三十多万斤腊肉。像这样乱抓畅销货的事情，决不是个别的。长沙市专卖公司发现啤酒好销，便到青岛等地购进一万多箱。长沙市零售公司以为猪油、棉絮是畅销货，盲目购进，占用公司过多的资金，一度发生资金调度不灵的困难，影响其他必需品的供应。其他一些公司所以不断地积压商品，也往往是因为无计划地乱抓畅销的商品所造成的。
    为什么这些公司对于畅销货这样地发生兴趣呢？是为了保证人民的需要吗？并不完全是这样。许多商品的积压，说明了这些地区的人民目前不需要这么多。有些经理说：“这是为了完成计划”。不知道他们所指的计划是什么。人们只知道国营商业的计划应该既要保证人民的需要，又要为国家积累资金。离开了这一原则，只想多抓畅销货多完成本单位的计划，而不问人民的需要，怎能算是“完成计划”呢？只管大量地购进畅销货，而不管国家资金的积压和浪费，那能算是什么“完成计划”呢？
    在这种“完成计划”的掩护下，他们还采用资本主义的竞争的方式，追逐利润，造成了市场上人为的紧张。湖南省土产公司、湖南省食品公司和湖南省供销合作社联合社，曾经为了购进某些畅销货，互相争夺货源和运输工具，甚至还提高收购价格。长沙市零售公司曾经发现福建干笋头畅销，把长沙市私商所有的干笋头收购过来，统一经营，造成市场上抢购干笋头的现象。这个公司的前任经理李飞在发现大家抢购干笋头以后，竟从每斤一元零七分提价到二元零二分。像这种单纯的营利观点，显然是十分错误的。
    在这次腊肉积压事件中，也表现了和社会主义原则不相容的单纯追逐利润的观点。本来湖南省土产公司和湖南省食品公司，可以在本省采购到足够的腊肉，保证人民的需要。为什么这两个公司都积极地派人到省外盲目采购呢？主要是因为四川和贵州的腊肉价钱便宜。有些干部说：“我们只想到价钱便宜，能多赚钱，所以就多买一些。”湖南省土产公司有个业务负责人也说：“搞一担干萝卜、干菜，费了很大劲，仅仅完成几元的计划；搞一担腊肉，不费很大劲，就完成七八十元计划，还可得到百分之二十以上的纯利。”所以他们就拼命采购，而不管市场的需要和有计划的经营了。更严重的是去年十一月和今年一月，有些省外的商业部门要购买湖南的腊肉，湖南省食品公司因为要等待“更好的价钱”，就拒绝出售。当腊肉已经积压、非得降低价格出售不可的时候，有些干部不愿意，说什么“何必减价呢？等到五月还可卖好价钱。”像这种观点，在国营商业部门是决不容许存在的。
    有些干部说：“国营商业不能不为国家积累资金呀！”是的，国营商业应该要为国家积累资金。问题是在怎样来积累资金。作为社会主义的国营商业，要为国家积累资金，就必须按照国家的计划，改善经营管理减少流转费用，加快资金周转来积累资金，绝对不是盲目进货、大量积压能够为国家积累资金的。
