　　At the Heart of "Second Baku"
　　——An Ural Travelogue (1)
　　By Our Correspondent Li He
    The Urals is one of the Soviet Union's powerful heavy industrial zones. It includes Sverdlovsk Oblast, Chelyabinsk Oblast, Molotov Oblast, the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, the Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, and Chkalov Oblast. This backbone of Soviet heavy industry, like a giant building communism, grows ever stronger. Here, I will report on some of my observations in the Urals in a series of articles.
                ×　×　×
    Everyone knows that the Soviet Union is rich in oil. In the North and South Caucasus, in Central Asia, on Sakhalin Island in the Far East, and even in Ukhta, near the Arctic Circle, there are oil enterprises. Among them, the oil production of Baku in Azerbaijan and the oil derricks stretching into the Caspian Sea are the most famous. But if you step into the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in the western Urals and the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic bordering it, you will see how rich and thriving the oil enterprises are here. This is the basic territory of the famous "Second Baku."
    The name "Second Baku" has in fact already exceeded the scope of its original meaning. Local oil workers will explain to you: "Now, the oil produced in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union accounts for more than 60 percent of the country's total, while in 1940 it was only a little more than 10 percent. This year, the daily oil production of Tatarstan and Bashkiria will exceed the level of Baku!"
    Tuimazy, nestled against low mountains, was originally a remote small town, but is now dotted with countless oil derricks. Driving along the flat asphalt road, even at a fast speed, it is impossible to make a complete circle of the oil field in a few tens of minutes.
    Under a derrick next to the asphalt road, there is a flowing oil well. It, like many flowing wells, can be heard from afar, the sound of its oil gushing through the oil pipes. A stone plaque hangs on the railing of this well, which reads: Well No. 100, Devonian oil was discovered here on September 26, 1944. The people of Tuimazy proudly point to it and say: "This is our first Devonian oil well." Ten years have passed, and this oil well continues to gush forth "black gold." It is a symbol of the rich oil content of the Devonian oil layer in "Second Baku." It reminds people of the story circulating among the locals about drilling into the Devonian oil layer.
    The story goes back ten years. As the Soviet Patriotic War drew closer to victory, the Soviet troops' aircraft, tanks, and vehicles needed more oil. According to the research of Soviet geologist Gubkin, between the Urals and the Volga, including western Bashkiria, there should be not only the more recent Carboniferous oil layer, but also the older Devonian oil layer, and it was estimated that this oil layer was at a depth of 1,500 to 2,000 meters. In 1937, the drilling team in Tuimazy discovered the Carboniferous oil layer at a depth of 1,150 meters, but the oil production was small. Exploration continued. One well after another was drilled, drilling to great depths, and for many years there were no results. Geologists and exploration teams did not lose heart. Finally, in September 1944, when drilling Well No. 100, a stone was pulled out from a depth of 1,700 meters, covered in sticky mud. People passed it around as an ordinary rock. Geologist Zolov noticed that many small bubbles were emerging from the stone, and the moist outer layer quickly cracked, confirming that the stone contained Devonian oil. After the well was drilled and the water and mud were removed, a stream of oil gushed up the well, falling like a heavy rain on the surrounding machinery and people. In the evening, the oil was already flowing into the oil pipes, and excited people still gathered around the oil well in groups.
    People did not fail to make the most of the rich oil layer discovered through hard work in Tuimazy. Here, the latest technology is used—injecting water into the periphery of the underground oil layer to maintain the pressure of the oil layer—to extract oil. I saw this artificial water injection project. At the same time as drilling oil wells, water wells are drilled around the oil layer. Water is injected through these water wells into the surrounding area of the underground oil layer. Under the action of the water's own weight and the pressure generated by the pumps, the water squeezes into the pores of the rock formation, increasing the pressure of the oil layer. The more water injected, the higher the pressure underground. In this way, the oil layer maintains a long-term, inexhaustible, self-flowing state during extraction. Peter Muztukhin, the director of the workshop that maintains oil layer pressure, said: "Usually, only 40 percent of the oil can be extracted from the oil layer, but with the peripheral water injection method, 85 percent of the oil can be extracted, and five-fourths fewer oil wells need to be drilled than usual. The peripheral water injection method saves Tuimazy many times the manpower, equipment, and many billions of rubles of funds." Tuimazy was one of the first places to adopt this new technology, and it is preparing to use it more widely. Now, oil fields in Stalingrad and other places are promoting this technology. According to an article written by Soviet Minister of the Oil Industry Baibakov in the magazine "Party Life": The pressure maintenance method enabled the Soviet Union to additionally produce about 9 million tons of oil in 1954 alone!
    Due to the use of the peripheral water injection method, the oil wells in the Tuimazy oil field do not appear as dense as those in Baku. The higher drilling derricks and the lower oil extraction derricks are staggered. Drilling is the decisive link in the oil enterprise. Today's drilling speed determines tomorrow's oil production. Relying on the equipment supplied by the Soviet machine-building industry, the Tuimazy drilling workers stubbornly conquer the hard geology here and constantly increase the drilling speed.
    The people who came to Tuimazy earlier talked about: In the first few years of drilling the Devonian oil wells, which average a depth of 1,700 meters, it took seven or eight months to drill one well. At that time, rotary drilling rigs were used. The drill bit of this kind of drilling rig rotates along with a long string of pipes, and two-thirds of the power is wasted for nothing. If this old-fashioned drilling method were continued to deal with the hard rock here, it would not be possible to develop the huge oil field here in ten years. Later, they quickly replaced the rotary drilling rigs with hydraulic turbine drilling rigs. In the repair shop at the drilling site, I saw the structure of the hydraulic turbine drilling rig. During drilling, the turbine is connected to the end of the long string of pipes, and the hydraulic power pushes the turbine, and the turbine pushes the drill bit, while the long string of pipes does not move. After adopting turbine drilling rigs and other new equipment, the Tuimazy workers began a competition for quickly drilling deep wells. Last August, the average drilling speed of the entire oil field reached 1,192.7 meters per drilling rig per month. Advanced drilling teams are now reaching speeds of 2,000 or even 2,500 meters per month per drilling rig.
    Here, many drilling rigs use water instead of mud to flush during drilling. This was created jointly by foreman Usov and engineer Yevstigneyev. This method is universally promoted in oil enterprises throughout the Soviet Union. When flushing with water, the drilling speed increases by an average of 45 to 50 percent. Water is not as viscous as mud, flows faster in the well, can completely flush out the crushed rock, and can accelerate the flushing process. Therefore, the productivity of the drilling rig is increased and the wear rate is reduced.
    Drilling work is carried out day and night, regardless of the cold or heat, by three shifts of workers. I went to an automated drilling rig. At this time, the weather was around minus 20 degrees Celsius, and the foreman and three workers were all working in leather jackets and leather gloves. The geology of Tuimazy is hard, and drilling is very expensive for drill bits. A well has to be changed hundreds of times. The drill bit is at the end of a long string of pipes, and each time it is changed, the 1,500-meter long string of pipes inside the well must be lifted and unscrewed section by section. After changing it, it must be installed and connected section by section and put into the well. Often the drill bit only works in the well for one or two hours, and changing it takes five or six hours. But it is automated here. After the drill bit is changed, a pile of pipes on the oil well derrick is moved one by one to the wellhead by an "iron hand" above, and another "iron hand" below installs and connects the pipes, and then puts them into the well. The workers operate by turning on the power switch. The automation of the operation of raising and lowering the pipes doubles labor productivity. This automated device is only being tested on individual drilling rigs, and personnel from the Oil Industry Design Institute are conducting on-site research to continue to improve it. But it has obviously been tested successfully. The people of Tuimazy say: "This is our drilling rig of tomorrow."
    I went to another oil well that was being drilled using an electric drill. Konstantin Yevstigneyev, director of the No. 1 Drilling Department of the oil mine, who was showing me around, said: "One-third of the wells currently being drilled by No. 1 Department use electric drills. By the end of the year, No. 1 Department will be drilling all wells using electric drills." The electric drill is similar in appearance to the turbine drill, and is also a long cylindrical steel pipe, but it contains an electric motor, and the electric motor is connected to the drill bit. During drilling, the long string of pipes does not move, and electricity is sent from the ground to the electric motor in the well through the wires inside the pipes, and the electric motor drives the drill bit. The drill bit automatically drills in the well, and if it is worn, it automatically stops working.
    The electric drill has been tested here for a long time. The drilling team of foreman Polyakovsky drilled 1,936.8 meters of wells in one month using an electric drill. Polyakovsky believes that the electric drill is stronger than the turbine drill. I asked the director of the No. 1 Drilling Department for his opinion. Yevstigneyev said: "Turbine drills and electric drills will coexist, just like trolleybuses and buses travel at the same time. Hydraulic turbine drills lose a lot of function when drilling deep wells, so it is necessary to increase the pressure supplied by the pump to drive the turbine. Electric drills use electricity, and lose very little function when drilling deep wells. The pump is only used to flush out the broken rock in the well, greatly reducing the wear rate of the pump, and smaller pumps can be used, which saves a lot of manpower and funds."
    The practice of the Tuimazy oil mine proves that the electric drill, like the peripheral water injection project, has an infinitely broad future in the oil industry.
    After the drilling workers drill the oil well, they hand it over to the oil extraction workers to take care of. The drilling work is heavier, and there are no female workers. Many female workers participate in the work of taking care of the oil wells. The main job of the oil extraction workers is to patrol and check the oil wells they are taking care of. I followed the oil extraction workers to their oil wells. There is a considerable distance between the oil wells. Tuimazy is windy. With the cold wind of minus 20 degrees Celsius accompanying me, walking on the snow-covered wilderness of half a foot, my ears and face immediately froze numb. In the eyes of the trained Tuimazy drilling and oil extraction workers, this is nothing. Oil extraction foreman Mukhammedshin Sharif said: "Of course, winter work is much more difficult. Therefore, we prepare for winter in the summer. From mid-June, we cover the engines and hoists with wooden fences. This prevents the wind and snow from hindering winter work."
    A competition to take care of multiple oil wells is unfolding among the oil extraction workers. The Party organization plays a decisive role in supporting and promoting this competition. Igey Sinkolenkov, secretary of the Party branch of the No. 2 Oil Extraction Department, said: "In the past, an oil extraction worker only took care of one or two oil wells. It was rare for anyone to take care of three. Female Communist Party member Smirnova, with the support of the Party organization, proposed a competition to take care of multiple oil wells at the workers' meeting. She herself started to take care of five oil wells. She calculated the time and systematically worked on these oil wells in rotation according to plan. Many workers responded to her initiative." When supporting innovators, the Party organization struggled against conservative ideas. When the Party branch committee discussed promoting this experience, the director and chief engineer of the department did not agree. The Party organization pointed out that there are always difficulties at the beginning of promoting new experiences, and even accidents should be estimated, but in the end, victory will be achieved. The administrative leaders were persuaded. The majority of workers responded to the call of the Party organization. A few workers still had concerns about the technical difficulties. Their opinions were solicited, and automatic pumping units were installed on the oil wells that were no longer flowing. Now each oil extraction worker takes care of seven to nine oil wells.
    Across a small river, the Ik River, from the Tuimazy oil field is the oil field of the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In winter, the Ik River is covered in white snow, and it is difficult for people to see the boundary between the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic here, but the Urals time used east of the river is two hours earlier than the Moscow time used west of the river. The workers of the two oil mines often conduct socialist competitions and exchange advanced experiences with each other.
    The oil from Tuimazy is extracted from the oil wells and flows through the oil pipes to the Ufa oil refinery. I went to this factory. It is one of the largest refineries in the eastern Soviet Union. Here, automated workshops, oil refining equipment, and oil storage tanks stretch for several kilometers. This factory was built in accordance with the decision of the 17th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and has been continuously expanded for the past 17 years, continuously supplying the various regions of the eastern Soviet Union with large quantities of petroleum products and oil industry cadres. Chief Engineer Alexander Yekanson told me: "Due to the adoption of new technologies, the factory increased oil production by 8 percent in 1954 compared to 1953. All employees guarantee to complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan before the October Revolution Day this year." It is not easy for such a large factory to complete the Five-Year Plan almost two months ahead of schedule.
    The oil mine workers of "Second Baku" respond to the call of the Party and the government to further develop heavy industry and agriculture by increasing the speed of drilling and the amount of oil extraction, and the refinery workers respond by increasing petroleum products. Tuimazy oil extraction worker Yashenko said to me: "My grandfather, father, and I are all oil workers for three generations. I know that producing one more ton of oil is producing many more tons of grain." The workers of the oil refinery increased the production of diesel fuel needed by tractors five times in 1954, and now they are continuing to increase production.

　　在“第二巴库”的中心
　　——乌拉尔纪行之一
　　本报记者　李何
    乌拉尔是苏联强大的重工业区之一。它包括斯维尔德洛夫州、车里雅宾斯克州、莫洛托夫州、巴什基里亚自治共和国、乌德摩尔特自治共和国和契卡洛夫州。这个苏联重工业的脊背，如同一个建设共产主义的巨人，越长越强大。在这里，我将连续报道一些在乌拉尔的见闻。
                ×　×　×
    人们都知道苏联盛产石油。在南北高加索，在中亚细亚，在远东的库页岛，以至靠近北极圈的乌赫塔，都有石油企业。其中，阿塞拜疆的巴库的石油产量和伸展在里海中的采油塔架，算是最出名的。但是如果你踏进乌拉尔西部的巴什基里亚自治共和国和同它毗邻的鞑靼自治共和国，那么你会见到，这里蓬勃发展着多么丰富的石油企业。这就是有名的“第二巴库”的基本境域。
    “第二巴库”这个名称事实上已经突破它的含义的范围了。当地的石油工作人员会向你解释说：“现在苏联东部地区出产的石油已经占全国百分之六十以上，而在一九四○年只比百分之十多一点。鞑靼和巴什基里亚在今年每昼夜的采油量将超过巴库的水平！”
    图伊玛兹依傍不高的山峦，原来是偏僻小镇，现在散布着数不清的石油塔架。乘着汽车，沿着平坦的柏油公路，纵使以很快的速度，在几十分钟内也来不及在油田上打一个圈。
    在柏油路旁一座塔架下，有一个自喷油井。它和许多自喷油井一样。好远就可以听见它的石油股泉在油管内流动的声息。在这个井的栏杆上挂着一个石牌，牌上写道：第一百号油井，一九四四年九月二十六日由此井发现了泥盆纪的石油。图伊玛兹的人们自豪地指着它说：“这是我们第一泥盆纪的石油井。”十年过去了，这座油井还不竭地涌冒出
  “黑色金汁”。它是“第二巴库”泥盆纪油层含有丰富的石油的象征。它使人回忆起当地人们传诵的一段钻探泥盆纪油层的故事。
    事情回到十年以前。当苏联卫国战争一天比一天走近胜利的时候，展开反攻的苏军的飞机、坦克、汽车需要更多的石油。根据苏联地质学家古布金的研究，在乌拉尔和伏尔加之间，包括巴什基里亚西部，应当不但有年代较近的石炭纪油层，而且有更古的泥盆纪油层，并且推断这个油层在一千五百公尺到二千公尺的深处。钻探队一九三七年在图伊玛兹钻探到一千一百五十公尺时候发现了石炭纪油层，产油不多。探矿工作继续进行。钻了一个又一个的井，钻到很深处，许多年没有结果。地质学家和探矿队没有灰心。终于在一九四四年九月钻凿第一百号井时候，从一千七百公尺深处掏出一个石块，石块上裹着黏黏的泥浆。人们把它当作普通的岩石传观着。地质学家佐洛也夫注意到石块上冒出了许多小气泡，外面潮湿的一层很快裂开了，确定了石块里含有泥盆纪的石油。钻好井，抽掉水和泥浆以后，一股石油猛喷上井来，大雨一般落在周围机器和人们身上。晚间，石油已经流注到油管里，兴奋的人们还成群地围住油井。
    人们没有辜负在图伊玛兹辛勤地探到的丰富的油层。这里用最新的技术——注水到地下油层外围以保持油层的压力——开采石油。我看到了这个人工注水工程。在钻凿油井的同时，环绕油层钻凿水井。经过这些水井注水到地下油层的周围。在水的本身重量和抽水机产生的压力的作用下，水挤进岩层的毛孔，提高着油层的压力。注水越多，井下压力越高。这样，油层在开采中保持着长期不竭的上喷状态。保持油层压力的车间主任彼得·穆兹图兴说：“通常从油层只能采油百分之四十，用外围注水方法能够采油百分之八十五，而且比通常少钻凿五分之四的油井。外围注水方法使图伊玛兹节省了许多倍人力、设备和许多亿卢布资金。”图伊玛兹是较先采用这个新式技术的地方，准备更广泛地运用它。现在斯大林格勒和其他地方的油田都在推行这个技术。据苏联石油工业部部长巴伊巴科夫在“党的生活”杂志上写的文章中说：保持压力的方法使苏联仅仅在一九五四年就额外增产了约九百万吨石油！
    由于采用外围注水方法，图伊玛兹油田的油井，看起来没有巴库那么稠密。较高的钻井塔架和较低的采油塔架交错着。钻井是石油企业中决定性的环节。今天钻井的速度决定明天石油的产量。图伊玛兹钻井工人依靠苏联机器制造业供给的设备，顽强地征服这里坚硬的地质，不断地提高钻井的速度。
    较早来到图伊玛兹的人们谈起：在钻凿平均深到一千七百公尺的泥盆纪油井的头一两年，一口井钻七八个月。当时用的是转子钻机。这种钻机的钻头随同长串管子转动，三分之二的动力白白耗费。如果继续用这个旧式钻井法来对付这里坚硬的石岩，那么十年也开发不了这里巨大的油田。以后他们很快就用水力透平钻机来代替了转子钻机。在钻井处的修理车间，我看到了水力透平钻机的结构。在钻井时，透平机接在长串管子的末节，水力推动透平，透平推动钻头，而长串管子不动。采用了透平钻机和其他新式设备，图伊玛兹工人开始了快速钻凿深井的竞赛。去年八月，整个油田钻井的平均速度达到了每台钻机一月钻进一千一百九十二点七公尺。先进钻井组现在达到了一个月一台钻机钻进二千甚至二千五百公尺的速度。
    这里许多钻机钻井时，用水代替泥浆来冲洗。这是工长乌索夫和工程师叶甫斯提格涅也夫合作创始的。苏联各地石油企业普遍推行这个方法。用水冲洗时，钻井速度平均提高百分之四十五到五十。水不像泥浆那样黏，在井内流转较快，能够完全冲出钻碎的岩石，能够加速冲洗过程。因此钻机的生产率提高而磨损率降低。
    钻井工作是不分昼夜，不顾寒暑，由三班工人进行的。我到了一座自动化的钻井面前。这时天气在零下二十度左右，工长和三个工人都穿着皮袄，戴着皮手套工作。图伊玛兹地质坚硬，钻井很费钻头。钻一口井得换成百次钻头。钻头在长串管子的末端，每换一次，要把井内一千五百公尺的长串管子一节节提起，卸开。换好后又要一节节地装接，放进井内。往往钻头在井下只工作一两小时，换它要五六小时。但它在这里是自动化了。换好钻头后，油井塔架上的一堆管子，由上面的一只“铁手”一杆一杆搬放在井口上，由下面的另一只“铁手”装接管子，然后放进井内。工人们开动电门操纵。升降管子的操作的自动化，使劳动生产率提高一倍。这个自动化装置还只在个别钻井上试用，有石油工业设计学院的人员就地研究，继续求取改进。但它显然已经试验成功了。图伊玛兹的人们说：“这是我们明天的钻井。”
    我到了另一座使用电钻机钻凿的油井面前。带我看的油矿第一钻井部主任康斯坦丁·叶甫斯提格涅也夫说：“第一部现在钻的井三分之一使用电钻机。到年底，第一部将全部使用电钻机钻井。”电钻机外表和透平钻机相似，也是长筒式的钢管，但里面装着电动机，电动机和钻头相连接。钻井时，长串管子不动，电力经过管子内的电线，从地面送给井下的电动机，电动机推动钻头。钻头在井下自动地钻凿，如果磨损了自动地停止工作。
    电钻机在这里久经了考验。波里雅科夫斯基工长的钻井组使用电钻机一个月钻井一九三六·八公尺。波里雅科夫斯基认为，电钻机比透平钻机还强。我请教第一钻井部主任的意见。叶甫斯提格涅也夫说：“透平钻机和电钻机将同时并存，就像无轨电车和公共汽车同时行驶一样。水力透平钻机在钻深井时要损失很大的功能，所以必须扩大抽水机所供给的压力以推动透平。电钻机使用电力，在钻深井时损失的功能极小，抽水机只用来冲出井下碎岩，大大降低抽水机的磨损率，可以使用较小的抽水机，这就节约许多人力和资金。”
    图伊玛兹油矿的实践证明：电钻机和外围注水工程一样，在石油工业中有着无限广阔的前途。
    钻井工人把油井钻好后交给采油工人照管。钻井工作较重，没有女工。照管油井的工作，有不少女工参加。采油工人的主要工作是巡回察看所照管的油井。我随采油工人到了他们的油井。油井和油井之间隔着相当的距离。图伊玛兹多风。在零下二十度的寒风伴送之下，步行在积雪半尺的旷野上，耳朵和脸孔立刻冻木了。在经过锻炼的图伊玛兹钻井和采油工人看来，这不算一回事。采油工长穆哈默德辛·沙里夫说：“冬天工作当然困难得多。所以我们在夏天就为冬天作了准备。从六月中旬就在发动机上和卷扬机上盖木栅。使冬天工作不受风雪的阻挠。”
    在采油工人中展开着照管多口油井的竞赛。党组织在支持和推动这个竞赛上起着决定性的作用。第二采油部支部书记伊盖·辛科连科夫说：“以前一个采油工人只照管一两口油井。有谁管上三口便是稀罕的事。女共产党员斯米尔诺娃，在党组织的支持下，在工人会议上提出了照管多口油井的竞赛。她自己开始照管五口油井。她计算时间，先后有计划地在这些口油井巡回工作。许多工人响应她的创举。”党组织在支持革新者时候，对保守思想进行了斗争。在党支部委员会讨论推广这个经验的时候，部主任和总工程师不赞成。党组织指出，推广新的经验开始时总有困难，甚至要估计到会发生事故，但是终归要胜利的。行政领导人被说服了。大多数工人响应党组织的号召。少数工人对技术的困难还有顾虑。征求他们的意见，在已经不自喷的油井装置了自动抽油机。现在每个采油工人都照管着七口到九口油井。
    和图伊玛兹油田隔着一条伊克小河，是鞑靼自治共和国的油田。冬天，伊克小河覆盖在白雪底下，人们在这里很难看到巴什基里亚自治共和国和鞑靼自治共和国的界线，但是河东用的乌拉尔的时间要比河西用的莫斯科时间早两小时。两个油矿的工人经常进行社会主义竞赛，互相交换先进经验。
    图伊玛兹的石油，由油井采出，经过油管流到乌发石油提炼工厂。我到了这个工厂。它是苏联东部最大的炼油厂之一。这里自动化的车间，炼油的设备和贮油的塔库，纵横几公里。这个工厂是按照苏联共产党第十七次代表大会的决定建立起来的，十七年来不断地扩建着，不断地输送给苏联东部各个地区以大量的石油产品和石油工业的干部。总工程师亚列克山得尔·叶康逊告诉我：“由于采用新的技术，工厂在一九五四年比一九五三年提高石油产量百分之八。全体职工保证在今年十月革命节前完成第五个五年计划。”这样大的工厂能够提前将近两个月完成五年计划，不是容易的。
    “第二巴库”的油矿职工以提高钻井速度和采油数量，炼油厂职工以增加石油产品，响应党和政府进一步发展重工业和农业的号召。图伊玛兹采油工人雅盛科对我说：“我的祖父、父亲和我三代都是石油工人。我知道，多产一吨石油，这就是多产许多吨粮食。”石油提炼厂工人在一九五四年增产了五倍拖拉机所需要的柴油，现在他们正在继续地增产。
