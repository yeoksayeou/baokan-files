Continue to Strengthen National Unity and Strive to Build Tibet
　　--Celebrating the Fourth Anniversary of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet
　　Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China Wang Feng
　　Today is the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. On this festive day of celebration for the Tibetan people, I extend warm congratulations to the people of Tibet.
　　Four years ago today, the Central People's Government and the Tibetan Local Government signed the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. This was a day of epoch-making significance in the history of the Tibetan people. From then on, the Tibetan people were forever freed from imperialist oppression and national oppression, returned to the fraternal and united family of all nationalities in the motherland, fully enjoyed the rights of national equality and freedom of religious belief, and gradually developed their own political, economic, and cultural life in the common cause of building the motherland, embarking on a bright and happy road.
　　Over the past four years, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet and the working personnel entering Tibet have correctly implemented the ethnic policies, religious policies, and the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao. Under difficult conditions, they have helped the Tibetan people gradually improve their material and cultural lives. The Tibetan people have gradually realized that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army respect the Tibetan people and their religious beliefs, and have come to help them create a happy life. Therefore, they call these people "Gaxueba" (New Han people). The Han and Tibetan peoples have established friendly and cooperative relations and forged close friendships in supporting the PLA's entry into Tibet and the construction of Tibet, greatly eliminating the national estrangement left over from history.
　　Before liberation, imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government adopted extremely vicious "divide and rule" tactics towards Tibet, causing the Tibetan people to remain in a state of disunity for a long time. The continuation of this state would obviously only benefit imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and would be detrimental to the Tibetan people. Therefore, the provision in the agreement regarding strengthening the internal unity of the Tibetan people is entirely correct and necessary. According to the agreement, Panchen Erdeni returned to Tibet with the welcome of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan monks and laypeople, and the harmonious relationship between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni was restored. In 1954, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, along with their key officials, negotiated the historical unresolved issues between the Tibetan Local Government and the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall Committee under the spirit of "mutual trust, mutual respect, and mutual understanding" as instructed by Chairman Mao, and reached a satisfactory agreement. These facts mark the further strengthening of the unity within the Tibetan people, and the realization of the wishes of the Tibetan people for decades. This is in line with the interests of the Tibetan people and the people of all nationalities across the country. It is a great happy event for the Tibetan people, and also a great happy event for the people of all nationalities across the country.
　　With the strengthening of national unity, the patriotic spirit of the Tibetan people has also grown significantly. Since 1952, more than 1,000 representatives of Tibetan delegations organized to pay tribute in Beijing and visit various places have come to Beijing. During their visits, they were warmly welcomed and treated by people of all nationalities across the country, and they saw the vigorous development of the motherland's construction, which further enhanced their understanding and love for the great motherland. Mass patriotic organizations in major Tibetan cities, such as the Patriotic Youth Cultural Federation and the Patriotic Women's Federation, have united the vast number of young men and women to carry out patriotic learning and activities.
　　In the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, the Tibetan people, under the leadership of the Tibetan Local People's Signature Campaign Committee Against the Use of Atomic Weapons, enthusiastically launched the signature campaign. This movement has spread to rural areas and pastures and has a broad mass base. This shows that the Tibetan people have actively joined the ranks of the people of all countries in the world in opposing imperialist wars and striving for world peace.
　　Thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, and thanks to the friendly unity and joint efforts of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, the Tibetan people, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet, and the working personnel entering Tibet, Tibet has made significant achievements in economic, cultural, and educational fields over the past four years. It is particularly worth mentioning the full opening of the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway in December 1954. The construction of these two highways was extremely difficult. The People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet and the road builders fought against various natural obstacles with a high degree of patriotic awareness and revolutionary heroism, and finally overcame the various difficulties in material life and working conditions, completing a rare feat in the history of highway construction, and realizing the ideals of the Han and Tibetan peoples for many years. The opening of these two highways is of great significance for strengthening the connection between Tibet and the mainland of the motherland, strengthening the unity between the Tibetan and other nationalities, promoting the development of the Tibetan people's economic and cultural undertakings, improving the Tibetan people's material and cultural lives, and consolidating the southwest defense of the motherland.
　　In September 1954, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, representing the Tibetan people, jointly came to Beijing to attend the first session of the First National People's Congress and the first plenary session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, participated in the discussion and formulation of the constitution, and were elected as national leading staff members to participate in the management of national affairs. This is unprecedented in Tibetan history. During this period, the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and his accompanying officials, under the instructions of Chairman Mao, studied the issue of establishing the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, visited major cities and large industrial and mining areas across the country, and participated in the State Council's meeting to discuss Tibetan work. The Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the accompanying Tibetan officials unanimously expressed their support for the central government and their concern for the construction of the motherland. This is a manifestation of the Tibetan people's patriotism, and also a manifestation of the greater unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within the Tibetan people.
　　Over the past four years, the achievements in implementing the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet have been remarkable. Our experience shows that only by correctly implementing the agreement can the Han and Tibetan nationalities and the internal unity of the Tibetan people be further strengthened. Only under the strengthening and consolidation of this unity can the economic and cultural undertakings of the Tibetan people be further developed.
　　In order to further strengthen the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within Tibet, and promote the development of Tibet's local politics, economy, and culture, the State Council passed the decisions on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, on helping Tibet to carry out construction matters, and on issues related to transportation in Tibet in March 1955. We firmly believe that these resolutions will be smoothly and gradually implemented in Tibet. Although the items in helping Tibet to carry out construction are at the beginning, and even still very few, this is of great significance for the future development of Tibet.
　　We know that the development of Tibet should mainly rely on the efforts of the Tibetan people. The facts of Tibet's development in recent years fully prove this point. For this reason, the central government fully considers the specific circumstances of Tibet and the wishes of Tibetan leaders in the formulation of all policies and laws related to Tibet, and decides after repeated consultations and deliberations. This spirit of the central government is undoubtedly entirely correct. Therefore, the relevant laws and policies formulated by it are also fully in line with the interests of the Tibetan people.
　　Tibet is a rich place with forests, minerals, land, and pastures, and its future development is bright and brilliant. The Tibetan people are a people who love labor, and they have fulfilled their glorious responsibility in the founding of the great motherland. We believe that they will continue to contribute great strength in defending the motherland, striving for world peace, and building socialism in the motherland. (Attached picture)

### 继续加强民族团结，为建设西藏而努力——庆祝和平解放西藏办法的协议签订四周年

　　继续加强民族团结，为建设西藏而努力
　　——庆祝和平解放西藏办法的协议签订四周年
    中华人民共和国民族事务委员会副主任　汪锋
    今天是和平解放西藏办法的协议签订四周年的纪念日。在这个西藏民族欢欣庆祝的节日里，我特向西藏人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    四年前的今天，中央人民政府和西藏地方政府签订了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。这在西藏民族的历史上，是具有划时代意义的一天。从此以后，西藏民族就永远摆脱了帝国主义压迫和民族压迫，回到祖国各民族友爱团结的大家庭，充分享受到民族平等和宗教信仰自由的权利，并在共同建设祖国的事业中，逐步发展自己的政治、经济、文化，走上了光明幸福的道路。
    四年来，中国人民解放军进藏部队和进藏工作人员正确地执行中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的民族政策、宗教政策以及和平解放西藏办法的协议，在艰难的条件下，帮助西藏人民逐步改善物质、文化生活。西藏人民已逐渐认识到中国共产党、人民解放军是尊重西藏民族和他们的宗教信仰的，是为了帮助他们创造幸福的生活而来的，因此称这些人为“嘉色巴”（新汉人）。汉藏人民在支援解放军进入西藏和建设西藏的工作中，树立了友好合作的关系，结成了亲密的友谊，使历史上遗留的民族隔阂大大地消除了。
    解放前，帝国主义和国民党反动政府对西藏采用了极端恶毒的“分而治之”的手段，因而使藏族内部长期地陷入不团结的状态。这种状态的延续，显然只能是对帝国主义、国民党反动派有利，而对西藏人民是不利的。因此，协议上作出的关于增强藏族内部团结的规定，是完全正确的，必要的。根据协议，班禅额尔德尼在达赖喇嘛和西藏僧俗人民欢迎下，返回西藏，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的和好关系，得到恢复。一九五四年达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼以及双方的主要官员在毛主席指示的“互相信任、互相尊重、互相谅解”的精神下，谈判了西藏地方政府同班禅堪布会议厅委员会之间的历史悬案问题，圆满地达成了协议。这些事实，标志着藏族内部的团结进一步加强了，几十年来西藏人民的愿望实现了，这是符合藏族人民的利益和全国各民族人民的利益的，是藏族人民的大喜事，也是全国各民族人民的大喜事。
    随着民族团结的加强，西藏人民的爱国主义精神也有了显著的增长。一九五二年以来，西藏组织的来北京致敬和去各地参观的代表团体前后在一千人以上。他们在参观中受到了全国各族人民的热烈欢迎和招待，亲眼看到祖国建设事业的蓬勃发展，从而更加认识到祖国的伟大，增进了对祖国的了解和热爱。西藏大城市中群众自己的爱国主义组织，如爱国青年文化联谊会、爱国妇女联谊会等都团结了广大的青年男女，进行着爱国主义的学习和活动。
    在反对使用原子武器的签名运动中，西藏人民在西藏地方人民反对使用原子武器签名运动委员会的领导下热烈地开展了签名运动。这个运动普及到农村、牧场，具有广泛的群众性。这表明西藏民族已积极地参加到世界各国人民反对帝国主义战争、争取世界和平运动的行列中来了。
    由于中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的正确领导，由于达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、西藏人民、人民解放军进藏部队和进藏工作人员的友爱团结和共同努力，四年来西藏在经济、文化教育等方面都取得了显著的成绩。特别值得指出的是，一九五四年十二月康藏公路、青藏公路的全线通车。这两条公路的工程是十分艰险的。进藏人民解放军和筑路员工以高度的爱国主义觉悟和革命英雄主义的气魄同种种自然障碍搏斗，终于克服了物质生活、工作条件上的种种困难，完成了公路建设史上少有的伟绩，实现了汉、藏两族人民多年来的理想。这两条公路的通车，对于密切西藏地方和祖国内地的联系，加强藏族和其他民族间的团结，促进西藏人民经济、文化事业的发展，改善西藏人民的物质、文化生活以及巩固祖国西南国防等方面，都有着重大的意义。
    一九五四年九月，赖达喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼代表西藏人民共同来到北京，出席了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议和中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议，参加了宪法的讨论和制定工作，并被选为国家的领导工作人员，参加了国家大事的管理工作。这在西藏历史上是空前的。在这期间，达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和他的随行官员，又依据毛主席的指示研究了成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的问题，一道参观了全国的大城市和大工矿区，参加了国务院讨论西藏工作的会议。达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和随行的西藏官员一致表示了对中央的拥护和对祖国建设事业的关怀。这是西藏民族爱国主义的表现，也是汉藏民族和藏族内部更加团结的表现。
    四年来，执行和平解放西藏办法的协议的成绩是显著的。我们的经验说明：只有正确地执行协议，汉藏民族和藏族内部才能更加团结。只有在这种团结的加强和巩固下，西藏民族的经济、文化事业才能更加发展。
    为了进一步加强汉藏民族和西藏内部的团结，促进西藏地方政治、经济和文化的发展，国务院于一九五五年三月通过了关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会、关于帮助西藏地方进行建设事项和关于有关西藏交通运输问题的决定。我们深信，这些决议在西藏将顺利地逐步实现。在帮助西藏地方进行建设的事项方面，虽方在开始，甚至仍是很少的，但这在西藏今后的发展上意义是极大的。
    我们知道，西藏的发展主要应依靠西藏人民的努力。几年来西藏发展的事实，完全证明了这一点。由于这种原因，中央在一切有关西藏问题的政策法令的制定中，都是充分地考虑到西藏具体情况，西藏领袖人物的意愿，并经过反复协商酝酿然后决定的。中央的这种精神，无疑地是完全正确的。因此，它所制定出来的有关法令和政策，也是完全符合于西藏人民利益的。
    西藏是一个富饶的地方，有森林、矿藏、土地、草场，它的发展前途是光明灿烂的。西藏民族是热爱劳动的民族，他们在伟大祖国的缔造中曾尽到了自己光荣的责任，我们相信在保卫祖国、争取世界和平以及祖国社会主义的建设中，他们也将继续贡献出伟大的力量。（附图片）
