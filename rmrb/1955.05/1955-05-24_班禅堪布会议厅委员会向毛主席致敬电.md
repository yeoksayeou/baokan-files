Panchen Kanpo Assembly Hall Committee Sends Respects to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

　　On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the signing of the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" on May 23rd, as we and the monastic and lay people warmly celebrate our increasingly happy life, we would like to extend our highest respect and heartfelt congratulations to you—the leader of all ethnic groups in China. Over the past four years, under your great policy of national unity and equality, and with the leadership and assistance of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, our various undertakings have been continuously advancing. In particular, the decisions on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and on assisting the local government of Tibet in construction matters, adopted at the seventh plenary meeting of the State Council in March this year, have greatly inspired the people of Tibet. In addition to continuing to consolidate our past achievements and strengthen unity, we will also take practical actions to vigorously support the construction of the Lhasa-Shigatse and Shigatse-Gyangtse highways, and strive to thoroughly implement the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," support the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and build our great motherland!
                              Respectfully, The Panchen Kanpo Assembly Hall Committee
                                May 23, 1955
                                Second day of the fourth month of the Wood Sheep Year in the Tibetan calendar
