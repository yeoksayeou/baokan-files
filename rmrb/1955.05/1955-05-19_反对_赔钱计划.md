Oppose the "Losing Money Plan"
　　Mou Lan
The Shenyang City Food Company has prepared a plan to lose 1.4 million yuan in 1955, which has been approved by the Shenyang City Commercial Bureau.
This is not the first time that the company has made a "losing money plan." Last year, the company's Livestock Products Department made a plan to lose 2,588,800 yuan, and the result was that it "overfulfilled" the plan.
It is said that the reason why the leading staff of this company formulate such a "losing money" plan is: "If we do accounting here, we cannot supply; if we supply, we cannot do accounting!" "We would rather suffer economic losses than political losses!" "The food company is a money-losing company!"
Of course, it is more difficult to operate live and fresh commodities than general commodities, but we must never come to the conclusion that: we must lose money to operate. For example, last winter, the leading staff of the Beijing Food Company's Pork Department attached importance to improving feeding and management work, promoted advanced experience, and pointed out the significance of pig breeding and management to the feeders. This year, the mortality rate of pigs has been greatly reduced, and the pigs gained more than 206,000 jin in weight in February and March, so they will not lose money. But how does the Shenyang Food Company raise pigs? Last August and September, the company ran away a total of 47 pigs. The telephones in the office kept ringing with reports from public security police stations from all directions: "The people sent a pig with no owner." The door of the slaughter workshop was not closed day and night, and packs of wild dogs ran into the workshop to eat pork. How can this not lose money?
The Shenyang Food Company's business attitude and methods can be definitely said to be inconsistent with the principles of economic accounting, nor can they guarantee market supply. As a result, it will both "suffer economic losses" and "suffer political losses." Isn't this an obvious and self-evident fact?
As a socialist enterprise, state-owned commerce not only has the task of meeting the people's needs for production and life, but also of accumulating funds for national industrialization. Any excuse that business is difficult and losing money is inevitable, like the Shenyang Food Company's attempt to make up for the serious loss of national wealth caused by poor management by making a losing money plan, is a criminal act of indifference to the national and people's wealth. The Shenyang City Commercial Bureau's casual approval of the losing money plan directly encourages this wrong business ideology and is also an extremely irresponsible behavior towards national wealth.

    反对“赔钱计划”
　　牟澜
    沈阳市食品公司编制了一个一九五五年赔钱一百四十万元的计划，这个计划已经沈阳市商业局批准了。
    这个公司订“赔钱计划”不是第一次，去年公司畜产部就订过一个赔钱二百五十八万八千元的计划，结果还“超额”完成了。
    据说这个公司的领导工作人员编制这种“赔钱”计划的理由是：“我们这儿要核算就不能供应，要供应就不能核算！”“宁肯经济上受损失，也不让政治上受损失！”“食品公司就是赔钱公司！”
    当然，经营活、鲜的商品是比较一般商品要困难些，但是决不能就此得出一个结论：要经营就得赔钱。例如去年冬天，北京市食品公司猪肉部领导工作人员重视了改善饲养保管工作，推广了先进经验，向饲养员指出生猪饲养保管工作的意义，今年生猪死亡率就大大降低，而且二、三月内生猪长重了二十万六千多斤，这就不会赔钱。可是沈阳市食品公司是怎样饲养生猪的呢？去年八、九月间，公司一共跑掉了四十七头猪。办公室里的电话不停地从四面八方传来公安派出所的报告：“老百姓送来一口没有主的猪。”屠宰车间的门昼夜不关，野狗成群结队地跑进车间里去大吃猪肉。这种情况又怎能不赔钱呢？
    沈阳市食品公司的这种经营态度和经营方法，可以肯定地说：既不符合经济核算的原则，也不能保证市场供应，而其结果，就会既使“经济上受损失”，也会使“政治上受损失”。这难道不是一目了然不言而喻的事实吗？
    作为社会主义企业的国营商业，它的任务不仅要满足人民对生产和生活的需要，而且要为国家工业化积累资金。任何借口经营有困难、赔钱不可免，像沈阳市食品公司这种企图以编制赔钱计划来弥补由于经营不善而造成国家财富严重损失的做法，都是对国家人民财富漠不关心的罪恶行为。沈阳市商业局随便批准赔钱计划的做法，直接助长了这种错误的经营思想，也是对国家财富极不负责的行为。
