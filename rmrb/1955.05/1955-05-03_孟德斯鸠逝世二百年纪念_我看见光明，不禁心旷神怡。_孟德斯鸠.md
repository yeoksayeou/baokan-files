Commemorating Montesquieu's Bicentennial
“I See the Light, and I Am Filled with Joy.” — Montesquieu
　　Luo Dagang
　　In the history of French literature, the eighteenth century has always been called the "Century of Enlightenment," [Note] which is the era of the so-called Enlightenment movement. Among the important thinkers and writers of the Enlightenment, Montesquieu is undoubtedly one of the first to see the light.
　　Montesquieu was born in 1689 and died in 1755. His representative works are generally recognized as the following three: "Persian Letters," "Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline," and "The Spirit of the Laws." Among these three masterpieces, "Persian Letters" and "The Spirit of the Laws" are particularly important. More than half a century ago, the Chinese translator Yan Fu had already translated the full text of "The Spirit of the Laws" from English, making it one of the earliest Western masterpieces that the Chinese people came into contact with. About thirty years after the publication of Yan Fu's translation, another complete Chinese translation of "The Spirit of the Laws" appeared in our country, entitled "The Essence of Myriad Laws." As for "Persian Letters," it also had a Chinese translation by Lin Shu early on (titled "Fish and Geese Reveal Secrets," serialized in the "Eastern Magazine" in 1916), so Montesquieu is no longer a strange name to the Chinese people.
　　Montesquieu's hometown is in southwestern France, near the famous commercial port of Bordeaux. He came from an aristocratic family; Montesquieu's father was a soldier, and he himself served as a judge and president of the court. In the position of president, which began in 1716, he initially worked very diligently, but soon felt that the laws at that time were full of cumbersome and unreasonable elements left over from the Middle Ages, lacking practical effectiveness in solving problems and in need of reform. Therefore, he initially developed the desire to study the laws and political systems of ancient and modern countries to seek ways of reform. However, the young Montesquieu was more interested in natural science. He joined the Bordeaux Academy of Sciences and presented several physics papers on echoes, weight, and the transparency of objects.
　　His experience in studying natural science in his youth had a profound impact on his lifelong thought and writings. He became accustomed to analyzing and understanding the various phenomena around him in the manner of observing natural phenomena, discovering that in the old and decaying feudal society, there were many dark and unreasonable things. "Persian Letters," published in 1721, is a collection of impressions accumulated from this observation.
　　After "Persian Letters" achieved great success, Montesquieu simply gave up his court position and devoted himself to writing; he not only read extensively but also traveled to England and other places to collect live materials; after more than twenty years of hard work, he finally completed the monumental work "The Spirit of the Laws."
　　When Montesquieu was immersed in writing, the political atmosphere in France gave people a sense of "a thunderstorm is coming, and it's unbearably sultry." This is a famous saying by the Russian revolutionary democratic thinker Herzen. This sentence vividly depicts the historical background at that time. The long reign of Louis XIV was the turning point of French feudal society from prosperity to decline. The feudal dynasty's military expansion, heavy taxes, and corvée caused profound disasters to the people, and also seriously hindered the somewhat established French emerging capitalism, which united with the masses of people in dire straits and increasingly openly showed disobedience to the old feudalism. The so-called "a thunderstorm is coming" means that a great social change is inevitable.
　　Montesquieu was one of the first and most deeply to foresee this inevitable great social change. This fierce change was the bourgeois revolution. Montesquieu's lifelong writings were completed under the enlightenment of this great premonition—a great vision. He used all his writings to answer this question: How to welcome the coming great change, and what attitude to take to deal with it? His answer is not simple; "The Spirit of the Laws" alone, translated into Chinese, already has seven or eight hundred thousand characters.
　　In general, Montesquieu adopted an actively promoting attitude towards the revolution. He advocated that citizens should be equal under the law and that citizens' political freedom should be guaranteed; to prevent the revival of absolutism, he suggested the separation of powers. However, due to his origin as a feudal aristocrat and the limitations of his thinking, his views on certain issues were conservative. For example, regarding the government system—the form of government—he advocated constitutional monarchy and opposed democratic republic. In Book XI of "The Spirit of the Laws," the author emphasized the various advantages of constitutional monarchy. When he was young, he was inclined to democratic republic. After traveling to England, he affirmed that constitutional monarchy best suited his ideals, so in Book XI, he excitedly introduced the British government system. Of course, Montesquieu, as a feudal aristocrat, would not hope that the feudal class would completely and cleanly withdraw from the political stage.
　　But "The Spirit of the Laws" still promoted many progressive ideas, such as Book XII on the political freedom of citizens and Book XV against the system of slavery. Equally important is the new attitude and new method of "The Spirit of the Laws" in dealing with problems. The original title of "The Spirit of the Laws," literally translated, should be "On the Spirit of Laws," with the subtitle: "The relationship that laws should have with the constitution of each government, with manners, climate, religion, commerce, etc." Until then, Western scholars had discussed legal issues from a metaphysical or theological point of view, while Montesquieu started from the actual life of human beings, from political and social life, and even from material conditions such as climate and topography; and he did not study laws as isolated phenomena. In the first chapter of the first book, he pointed out clearly that the laws of human society are equal to the laws of all things in nature; therefore, laws are by no means produced by "blind fate" but are determined by the mutual relationships between people. Montesquieu's research method is obviously different from the traditional subjective and idealistic methods. In the preface, he said: "I did not derive any principles from my prejudices; everything is based on the essence of things."
　　In his literary masterpiece "Persian Letters," Montesquieu demonstrated a spirit of calmly observing and analyzing and of extensively exploring and understanding actual life. At that time, he was a young man in his thirties, filled with dissatisfaction with the current situation, and his passion for the country and the people overflowed in his heart. "Persian Letters" not only used sharp and subtle satire to expose the dark curtain of feudal society but also put forward positive and constructive opinions at any time. Just like the character Usbek in the book, Montesquieu had long had the habit of recording everything he heard, saw, and felt during the day in the evening. From years of diaries, the sensational masterpiece "Persian Letters" was produced.
　　In order to avoid the dryness of the text and to win a wide readership, the author deliberately did not use the form of essays, notes, or theses but used the interesting form of overseas correspondence to attract readers with his serious thoughts. Usbek in the book is the author's spokesperson, through whom Montesquieu expresses more systematic and in-depth opinions and discusses some serious issues; thus, this Persian who travels to Paris becomes an epitome of Enlightenment thinkers. The author was afraid that Usbek's solemn discussions would bore the reader, so he created the character Rica; in Rica's letters, Montesquieu's light and subtle satirical style is concentrated, playing a just right role in regulating Usbek's solemn attitude. However, these letters of varying lengths are ultimately rewritten from miscellaneous short essays and lack connection and consistency with each other. The author obviously worried that readers might not be able to read them from beginning to end in one breath, so every few letters about general issues, he inserted one or several letters describing the secrets of the Persian harem to attract the reader's curiosity. However, this part of the letters is by no means merely a boring embellishment or frivolous game, as bourgeois literary historians say. In these letters, Montesquieu powerfully denounced the barbarity and cruelty of feudalism through the description of the tragic fate of women and eunuchs in the harem: one person's joy is at the expense of the blood and tears of thousands. The last few letters of "Persian Letters" revealed shocking news, that is, an open "rebellion" broke out among the women in the harem. The women were unwilling to endure inhuman treatment any longer; regardless of everything, they raised the banner of resistance. Isn't this enough to show how deeply the author hated the dark things of feudal society?
　　Soviet critics believe that "Persian Letters" is the most interesting of Montesquieu's works for today's readers (see page 198 of the French edition of "Soviet Literature" in February this year). We fully agree with this view. Of course, "Persian Letters" is of interest to us, not only because it is a unique masterpiece of satirical literature, not only because of Montesquieu's elegant style, but mainly because of its ideological content. The author raises the banner of equality and freedom, opposes corrupt things, and promotes their demise; in this battle, the author puts forward many positive opinions, representing not only the interests of the rising bourgeoisie but also the interests of the broad masses of the people at that time. For example, regarding unjust wars, the author of "Persian Letters" expressed an uncompromising condemnation. He said: "There are only two kinds of wars that are just wars: one is a war to resist enemy invasion; the other is to rescue allies who have been invaded. Wars waged by monarchs due to personal disputes have no justice at all." (Letter 95) He also said: "Conquest, this action, does not in itself give the conqueror any rights... Conquest is a monument to tyranny." (Ibid.) Today, when a small handful of people in the world are dreaming wildly of conquering the entire earth with money and weapons of mass destruction, Montesquieu's just remarks have not become invalid after more than two hundred years.
　　The author of "Persian Letters" even foresaw the possibility of mankind inventing weapons of mass destruction, but at the same time, he also predicted that the power of the people would surely crush the murderers' conspiracy. Through Leidie—a young Persian traveling in Venice—he said: "The invention of bombs has caused all the people of Europe to lose their freedom... Since the invention of gunpowder, there has been no impregnable fortress, which means, Usbek, that there is no hiding place in the world to resist injustice and violence. I have been trembling for fear that someone will eventually discover some secret, thereby achieving a shortcut to harming the people and destroying entire nations and countries." (Letter 105)
　　Leidie is a young student, and the learned and thoughtful Usbek is the teacher he admires. The author often lets Leidie ask some naive questions, triggering Usbek's—that is, Montesquieu's—wise remarks. He said: "You say you (referring to Leidie) are afraid that people will invent a more cruel method of destruction than the methods currently used. No. If such an extremely serious invention appears, it will immediately be prohibited by people's rights, and with the consent of the people of all countries, this invention will be buried." (Letter 106)
　　Chapters expressing the will and emotions of the broad masses of the people are undoubtedly the immortal part of Montesquieu's works. It is no accident that "Persian Letters" and "The Spirit of the Laws" were unprecedented bestsellers at the time and were widely disseminated.
　　The banner of bourgeois democracy and freedom that Montesquieu and later Enlightenment thinkers once held high, as Stalin said, has been abandoned by those who are frantically preparing for another war of aggression and another massacre. The principles of equality and freedom advocated by Montesquieu have also been trampled on by imperialists and colonialists. The people of the world who love peace are commemorating the great French thinker Montesquieu, who died two hundred years ago, in various countries and regions this year, which is also a demonstration of their determination to carry the banner of independence and freedom and advance on the road to striving for lasting peace.

　　Note: The so-called "Century of Enlightenment" refers to the fact that at that time, some writers with relatively progressive ideas began to light torches in the darkness of feudal culture. (Attached picture)

　　孟德斯鸠逝世二百年纪念
　　“我看见光明，不禁心旷神怡。”——孟德斯鸠
　　罗大冈
    法国文学史上，一向称十八世纪为“光明的世纪”，〔注〕也就是一般所谓启蒙运动的时代。在启蒙运动的重要思想家和作家之中，孟德斯鸠无疑地是最早看见光明的人之一。
    孟德斯鸠生于一六八九年，死于一七五五年。他的代表著作，一般公认为下列三种：“波斯人信札”、“罗马盛衰原因考”、“法意”。在这三种名著中，“波斯人信札”和“法意”尤其重要。半个多世纪以前，中国的翻译家严复，已经把“法意”全文，从英文转译过来，成为中国人民最早接触到的西洋名著之一。在严复的译本出版后约莫三十年光景，“法意”在我国又出现了另一种完整译本，名为“万法精理”。至于“波斯人信札”，在我国也早有林纾的译本，（题为“鱼雁抉微”，连载于一九一六年的“东方杂志”），所以，对于中国人民，孟德斯鸠已经不是一个陌生的名字了。
    孟德斯鸠的故乡在法国西南部，有名的商港波尔多附近。他出身于贵族家庭；孟德斯鸠的父亲是军人，而他本人，却当过法官和法院院长。在一七一六年开始的院长职位上，他起初工作很认真，但不久即感到当时法律充满着中世纪遗留下来的繁琐不合理的地方，缺少解决问题的实际效果，必须加以改革。因此他初步发生了研究古今各国法律，政制，寻求革新之道的意愿。但是年轻的孟德斯鸠，对于自然科学更感到浓厚兴趣。他参加了波尔多科学院，提出几篇关于回声、重量、以及物体透明性等物理学论文。
    他在年轻时钻研自然科学的经验，对于他毕生的思想与著作，起了深刻作用。他习惯于用观察自然现象方式，来分析和理解周围的形形色色，发现老朽腐化的封建社会中，存在着许多黑暗和不合理的事物。发表于一七二一年的“波斯人信札”，就是这种观察中所积累的感想。
    “波斯人信札”获致极大成功以后，孟德斯鸠索性放弃法院职务，专心一意地从事著述；不但博览书籍，并且游历英国等地，搜辑活的资料；积二十余年的辛勤，终于完成“法意”这部巨著。
    当孟德斯鸠埋头著作时，法国的政治气氛，令人有“雷雨将至，闷热不堪”之感。这是俄国革命民主主义思想家赫尔岑的名言。这句话确乎很生动地描绘出当时历史背景。漫长的路易十四王朝，是法国封建社会由盛入衰的转折点。封建王朝的穷兵黩武，苛税重役，使人民遭受深重的灾难，也使有若干基础的法国新兴资本主义受到严重阻碍，它和水深火热中的人民大众联合起来，向老朽的封建主义，越来越明显地表示不恭顺。所谓“雷雨将至”，也就是说巨大的社会变革势在不免。
    孟德斯鸠是最早地、最深切地预感到这不可避免的社会大变革的人之一。这一场激烈的变革，就是资产阶级革命。孟德斯鸠毕生的著作，都在这一伟大的预感——伟大的远景启示之下完成的。他用全部著作，来回答这个问题：如何迎接即将到来的巨大变革，采取什么态度去对付它？他的答案不是简单的，仅仅“法意”一书，译成中文已经七八十万字。
    总起来说，孟德斯鸠对于革命采取了积极推动的态度，他主张公民在法律上一律平等，并且保障公民的政治自由；为了防止绝对主义的复活，他建议三权分立。可是，由于他的出身是封建贵族，思想上受到一定的限制，因此对于若干问题，他的看法是保守的。例如对于政府制度——政权形式——他主张君主立宪，反对民主共和。“法意”第十一卷中，作者着重提出君主立宪的各种优点。年轻时，他曾经倾向于民主共和，游历英国以后，他肯定君主立宪最合乎他的理想，因此在第十一卷中，他兴奋地介绍了英国政府制度。当然，身为封建贵族的孟德斯鸠，是不会希望封建阶级彻底、干净地退出政治舞台的。
    但是“法意”还是宣传了许多进步思想，例如第十二卷论公民的政治自由，第十五卷反对奴隶制度等。同样重要的是“法意”处理问题的新态度和新方法。“法意”书名原文直译应当是“论法律的精神”，副标题是：“法律同政府制度、风俗、气候、宗教、商业等应有的关系。”直到那时，西方的学者都用玄学或神学的观点谈论法律问题，而孟德斯鸠却从人类实际生活出发，从政治和社会生活，甚至从气候、地形等物质条件出发；并且不是将法律作为孤立现象去研究。他在第一卷第一章，开宗明义，指出人类社会的法律，等于自然界万物的规律；因此法律决不是“盲目的命运”所产生的，而是决定于人与人之间相互的关系。孟德斯鸠的研究方法，显然和传统的主观与唯心的方法有所区别。他在序文中说：“我没有从我的成见中寻绎出任何原则，一切都根据事物本质。”
    孟德斯鸠在他的文学代表作“波斯人信札”里，表现了冷静地观察和分析和广泛地探索和了解实际生活的精神。他那时是三十岁左右的年轻人，充满着对当前现状不满的情绪，忧国忧民的热情泛滥在他心中。“波斯人信札”不但用尖刻而微妙的讽刺，尽情戳穿封建社会的黑幕，并且随时提出正面的、建设性的意见。正和书中人物郁斯贝克一样，孟德斯鸠老早有此习惯：凡白天所闻、所见、有所感触的一切，晚间都记下来。从经年累月的日记中，产生了一鸣惊人的名著“波斯人信札”。
    为了避免文字枯燥，争取广大读众，作者故意不用杂感、随笔、或论文的形式，而使他的严肃的思想，通过海外通信的有趣的形式，吸引读者。书中郁斯贝克就是作者的代言人，通过他，孟德斯鸠发表较有系统和深入的意见，谈论一些严肃的问题；因而这一游历巴黎的波斯人，俨然成了启蒙运动思想家的缩影。作者生怕郁斯贝克道貌岸然的议论引起读者厌烦，于是创造了黎伽这一人物；在黎伽的书信中，集中表现了孟德斯鸠轻松微妙的讽嘲的文笔，对于郁斯贝克正襟危坐的态度，起着恰到好处的调剂作用。但是，这些长短不齐的信札，究系杂感式的短文改写而成，相互之间，缺少联系和一贯性。作者显然担心读者未必能从头至尾一气读完，于是每隔若干封有关一般问题的信，插入一封或数封叙述波斯后宫秘况的信，牵引住读者的好奇心。但是，这一部分信札，决不是如资产阶级文学史家们所说，仅仅是无聊的点缀，轻薄的游戏文章。在这些信札里，孟德斯鸠通过对后宫妇女和宦官的悲惨命运的描述，有力地控诉了封建主义的野蛮和残酷：一人的欢乐，以万人的血泪为代价。“波斯人信札”的最后几封信，透露了惊人的消息，那就是在后宫妇女之间，爆发了公开的“叛变”。妇女不愿再忍受非人的待遇，她们不顾一切，举起了反抗的大旗。这难道还不够说明作者对于封建社会的黑暗事物，怀着多么沉痛的憎恨么？
    苏联的评论家认为“波斯人信札”在孟德斯鸠的著作中，最使今日的读者感到兴趣（见今年二月份“苏联文学”法文版第一九八页）。我们完全同意这一看法。当然“波斯人信札”使我们感兴趣，不仅因为这是一部别开生面的讽刺文学杰作，不仅因为孟德斯鸠潇洒的文笔，而主要地决定于思想内容。作者举起平等、自由的大旗，反对腐朽的事物，促使它们死亡；在这战斗中，作者提出许多积极的意见，不但代表上升中的资产阶级利益，也代表了当时广大人民的利益。比如对于非正义战争，
  “波斯人信札”的作者表示了不留余地的谴责。他说：“只有两类战争是正义的战争：一类是为了抗拒敌人侵袭而进行的战争；另一类，为了援救被侵袭的同盟者。君主由于个人的争吵而进行的战争，毫无正义之可言。”（信九十五）又说：“征服这行动，本身并不给予征服者任何权利……征服乃是暴政的纪念碑。”（同上）在我们今天，世界上有一小撮人正在做以金元和大规模毁灭性武器征服全地球的狂梦，孟德斯鸠的正义言论，并未因为经过了二百多年而失效。
    “波斯人信札”的作者甚至预见了人类发明大规模毁灭性武器的可能，但同时他也预料到人民的力量，一定能粉碎杀人犯的阴谋。通过磊迭——在威尼斯游历的年轻波斯人——的口说：“炸弹的发明，全欧人民因此丧失自由……自从火药发明以来，就没有不可攻取的要塞，这就是说，郁斯贝克，世上没有任何抵御非正义与暴力的藏身处了。我一直在发抖，怕有人终于发见某种秘密，因而达到残害人民，毁灭整个民族和国家的捷径。”（信一○五）
    磊迭是个年轻学生，博学深思的郁斯贝克是他敬仰的老师。作者往往让磊迭提出一些天真的问题，引发郁斯贝克—也就是孟德斯鸠的贤明议论。他说：“你说你（指磊迭）怕人们发明一种比目前应用的方法更其残酷的毁灭方法。不。假如出现了这种极端严重的发明，它立刻会被人们的权利所禁止，在各国人民同意之下，这种发明会被埋葬。”
  （信一○六）
    表达广大人民的意愿和情感的篇章，无疑地是孟德斯鸠作品中不朽的部分。“波斯人信札”和“法意”在当时得到空前畅销，广泛传播，绝不是偶然的。
    孟德斯鸠以及稍后的启蒙运动思想家们曾经高举过的资产阶级民主自由的旗帜，正如斯大林所说，已经被疯狂地准备再一次侵略战争，再一次大屠杀的人们所抛在一边了。孟德斯鸠所提倡的平等和自由等原则，也被帝国主义和殖民主义者所践踏了。全世界热爱和平的人民，今年在各国各地纪念两百年前逝世的、法国伟大思想家孟德斯鸠，也就是决心扛起独立自由的大旗，在争取持久和平的道上前进的一种示威。
