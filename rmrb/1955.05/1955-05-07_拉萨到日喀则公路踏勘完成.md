　  Lhasa to Shigatse Highway Survey Completed

    The route survey for the Lhasa to Shigatse highway has been completed. Some personnel from the two survey teams of the First Design Division of the General Bureau of Highways of the Ministry of Communications have begun measuring the route west of Yangbajing.

    This highway is ninety-three kilometers long from Lhasa to Yangbajing, this section utilizes the Qinghai-Tibet highway route. From Yangbajing to Shigatse, it is more than two hundred and fifty kilometers long. The route passes through the Yangbajing grassland, crosses the Xugela (mountain) at an altitude of about 5,000 meters, and the Mazhala, then crosses the Yarlung Zangbo River, and follows the south bank to Shigatse. The area through which the route passes is mostly flat, with little earth and stone work required. Except for the Yarlung Zangbo River and the Nyang Chu River, which require the construction of two large bridges, only some smaller bridges and culverts need to be built.

　  拉萨到日喀则公路踏勘完成
    拉萨到日喀则公路的线路踏勘已经完成。交通部公路总局第一设计分局的两个测量队的部分人员已开始测量羊八井以西的线路。
    这条公路从拉萨到羊八井长九十三公里，这段是利用青藏公路路线。从羊八井到日喀则全长二百五十多公里，路线穿过羊八井草原，越过拔海五千公尺左右的旭格拉（山）和马扎拉后，跨过雅鲁藏布江，沿着江南岸到日喀则。路线经过的地方，大部地势平坦，土石方少，除雅鲁藏布江和年楚河需修建两座大桥外，其余只要修建一些较小的桥涵。
