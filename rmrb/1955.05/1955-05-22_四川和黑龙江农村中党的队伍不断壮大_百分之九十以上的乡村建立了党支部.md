　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 21st. The ranks of the Communist Party of China in the rural areas of Sichuan Province are constantly growing. Since last winter and this spring, the province has admitted more than 100,000 outstanding farmers into the Party during the agricultural cooperation movement. Now, over 96 percent of the villages in Sichuan Province have established Party branches, and about 98 percent of agricultural production cooperatives have Communist Party members.

　　The newly admitted Party members are all advanced elements in the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. Luo Haichen, a 65-year-old member of the Qinggang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bishan County, tirelessly promoted the advantages of cooperatives in Siping, Gaoqiao, and other villages more than a dozen miles away from the start of the cooperative's construction. He also fought against phenomena that harmed the interests of the entire cooperative. Later, he was named a model propagandist for the entire district and a first-class model of love for the cooperative. In December 1954, he was honorably admitted as a member of the Communist Party of China. Among the more than 24,000 new Party members in Mianyang, Nanchong, and three other special districts, more than 5,000 hold leading positions in agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and villages. All 22 new Party members in Xinlong Township, Longchang County, were elected by the masses as chairmen, vice-chairmen, and committee members of agricultural production cooperatives.

　　While building the Party, Party organizations at all levels in Sichuan Province also paid close attention to the consolidation of the Party. Before the spring plowing, Party organizations in all special districts and counties throughout the province generally conducted short-term training for the leading cadres of branches and some Party members. In the Jiangjin Special District, 70 percent of the branch secretaries or deputy secretaries and more than 3,700 rural Party members underwent training. The grassroots Party organizations in rural areas have also generally established a system of regular Party lectures.

　　According to Xinhua News Agency, at present, 94 percent of the villages in Heilongjiang Province have established Communist Party branches. The vast majority of Communist Party members in rural areas have joined agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, while the rest have taken up jobs in rural supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, agricultural technology extension stations, and as primary school teachers. According to statistics from 2,882 agricultural production cooperatives in 11 counties, including Tongbei, Ning'an, and Wuchang, 91 percent of the cooperatives have Communist Party organizations and Communist Party members.

　　The grassroots organizations of the Communist Party in rural areas have become fortresses for promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture. Many leading cadres and model figures in mutual aid and cooperative organizations are Communist Party members, and they conscientiously implement the Party's policies in their work. The Juren Village Branch of the Communist Party of Bin County often conducts education on the two roads for its members, timely criticizes and overcomes the phenomenon of some wealthy members excluding poor farmers, and correctly implements the Party's class line in rural areas.

　　The grassroots organizations of the Party in Heilongjiang Province also frequently conduct patriotic and collectivist education among the broad masses of farmers, raising their socialist consciousness. Many enlightened farmers have requested to join the Communist Party. In 1954, Party organizations throughout the province admitted more than 10,000 advanced elements who had been examined into the Party.

　　In order to further strengthen the work of the grassroots organizations of the Party in rural areas, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a working conference on the grassroots Party organizations in rural areas. After repeated discussions, a plan for the development and consolidation of the work of the grassroots Party organizations in rural areas was put forward.

　　四川和黑龙江农村中党的队伍不断壮大
　　百分之九十以上的乡村建立了党支部
    新华社成都二十一日电　四川省农村中共产党的队伍不断壮大。从去冬今春以来，全省在农业合作化运动中接收了十万多名优秀农民入党。现在四川省百分之九十六以上的乡建立了党的支部，约百分之九十八的农业生产合作社里有了共产党员。
    被接收的新党员都是农村互助合作运动中的先进分子。璧山县青杠农业生产合作社六十五岁的老社员罗海臣，从建社工作一开始就不辞劳苦地到十几里路外的四平、高桥等乡宣传合作社的优越性，在社里并随时向损害全社利益的现象作斗争，后来他被评为全区的模范宣传员和社里的一等爱社模范，一九五四年十二月光荣地被接收为中国共产党党员。绵阳、南充等五个专区二万四千多名新党员中，有五千多名担任着农业生产合作社、互助组和乡的领导职务。隆昌县新龙乡的二十二名新党员全被群众推选为农业生产合作社的社长、副社长和社务委员。
    四川省各地党组织在建党工作的同时，还十分注意党的巩固工作。春耕前全省各专区和县的党组织，普遍对支部的领导骨干和部分党员进行了短期训练。江津专区百分之七十的支部书记或副书记以及三千七百多名农村党员都经过了训练。各地农村党的基层组织还普遍建立了定期上党课的制度。
    据新华社讯　目前黑龙江省已有百分之九十四的村建立了共产党支部。农村中的共产党员绝大多数参加了农业生产合作社和互助组，其余担任了农村供销合作社、信贷合作社、农业技术推广站和小学教员等工作。据通北、宁安和五常等十一个县的二千八百八十二个农业生产合作社的统计，百分之九十一的合作社有了共产党的组织和共产党员。
    共产党在农村中的基层组织，已成为推动农业社会主义改造的堡垒。许多互助合作组织中的领导骨干和模范人物都是共产党员，他们在工作中认真贯彻了党的政策。中共宾县居仁村支部经常向社员进行两条道路的教育，及时批判和克服某些富裕社员排斥贫困农民的现象，正确地贯彻党在农村的阶级路线。
    黑龙江省党的基层组织还经常向广大农民进行爱国主义和集体主义教育，提高了农民的社会主义觉悟。很多觉悟了的农民要求加入共产党。在一九五四年内，全省党组织曾接收了一万多名经过考察的先进分子入党。
    为了进一步加强党在农村的基层组织的工作，中共黑龙江省委员会最近召开了农村基层党的组织工作会议，经过反复讨论，提出了发展和巩固农村基层党组织工作的计划。
