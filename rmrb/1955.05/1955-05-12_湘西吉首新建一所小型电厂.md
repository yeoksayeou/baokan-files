　　A New Small Power Plant Built in Jishou, Xiangxi
　　A small power plant newly built in Jishou, the seat of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province, began generating electricity on this year's "May Day".

　　The new power plant has more than three times the power generation capacity of the original power plant. In the past, when the Xiangxi No. 1 People's Hospital gave patients fluoroscopies, due to insufficient voltage, it had to wait until 11 o'clock in the evening to start the fluoroscopy; now, this system that was unfavorable to patients will be changed. With the completion of the new power plant, some small local state-owned factories will also appear in this mountain city. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　湘西吉首新建一所小型电厂
    在湖南省湘西苗族自治州政府所在地——吉首新建的一所小型发电厂，已在今年“五一”节开始发电。
    新建电厂比原来电厂的发电能量大三倍多。过去，湘西第一人民医院给病人透视时，因为电压不足，要等到晚上十一点钟才能开始透视；现在，这个不利于病人的制度将随着改变了。随着新的电厂的建成，在这座山城里，还将出现一些小型的地方国营工厂。（新华社）
