Lingbao County Third Junior High School
New Vistas Appear After Saving Kerosene

To the Editor:

    The People's Daily issued the call to "Everyone Save Kerosene" on April 19th. I think this is very necessary. Based on the experience of our Lingbao County Third Junior High School in Henan Province, saving kerosene in schools is entirely possible.

    Our school has a total of nine classes, and in the past, we used 135 lamps, consuming about 240 jin of kerosene per month. There are 34 faculty and staff members, who used to use 34 lamps, plus three lamps in the toilets, consuming more than 130 jin of kerosene per month. In early December last year, the County Finance Committee notified our school to save kerosene, reducing monthly usage to 200 jin. The school's Party organization mobilized all teachers, students, and staff to discuss and come up with many ways to save without affecting teaching. It was decided to convert ninety lamps in the six second and third-grade classes into six gasoline lamps. Each class made sure to light lamps later and turn them off earlier during evening self-study. In this way, the six classes could save about four jin of kerosene every night. Faculty and staff implemented a collective office system, reducing thirty-four lamps to twelve. The amount of kerosene used for dormitory lamps was also appropriately reduced. This could save about two jin of kerosene every night.

    From December 1954 to April of this year, nearly five months, our school not only saved nearly a thousand jin of kerosene but also saw some new developments. Students' evening self-study and faculty and staff's evening office work and lesson preparation have become more intense than in the past. The phenomenon of chatting, playing chess, or reading books all night has disappeared. Everyone has developed good habits of concentrating on work and going to bed on time.

### 灵宝县第三初级中学　节约煤油后出现新气象

　　灵宝县第三初级中学
　　节约煤油后出现新气象编辑同志：
    四月十九日人民日报提出了“大家都来节约煤油”的号召。我认为这是很必要的。根据我们河南省灵宝县第三初级中学的经验，在学校里节约煤油是完全做得到的。
    我校学生共有九个班，过去用罩灯一百三十五盏，每月用油二百四十斤左右。教职员工三十四人，过去用灯三十四盏，另外厕所用灯三盏，每月用油一百三十斤以上。去年十二月初，县财委通知我校要节约煤油，每月减为用油二百斤。学校党组织就发动全体师生员工讨论，在不影响教学的原则下想出了很多节约的办法。二、三年级六个班的九十盏罩灯决定改为六个汽灯。各班晚上自习时做到晚点灯、早熄灯。这样，六个班每晚就能节约四斤左右煤油。教职员工执行集体办公制度，三十四盏灯缩减为十二盏。寝室用灯的用油量也适当减少。这样每晚也可以节约煤油二斤左右。
    从一九五四年十二月到今年四月将近五个月中，我校不但节约了近千斤煤油，而且还出现了一些新气象。学生晚上自习和教职员工晚上办公、备课都比过去紧张了。通夜闲扯、下棋或者看书的现象没有了。大家养成了工作时集中注意力和按时作息的良好习惯。
