To the Editor:

　　On February 13th of this year, the Northwest District Company Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Petroleum Company sent two train cars of gasoline, totaling 73.523 tons, from Lanzhou East Station to Qujiang.

　　After the goods were dispatched from Lanzhou East Station, they passed through Baoji, Zhengzhou, and Shanhaiguan, and were diverted to Qujiang in Heilongjiang Province, covering a total distance of 3,592 kilometers, with freight charges amounting to 10,084.8 yuan. After such a long journey and high transportation costs, no one claimed the goods upon arrival in Qujiang. The Railway Bureau also did not pay attention to this batch of unclaimed gasoline. Soon, this batch of gasoline was transported from Qujiang to Mudanjiang City (arriving in Mudanjiang on March 21st). After arriving in Mudanjiang, it remained unclaimed. Under these circumstances, the Mudanjiang Railway Bureau asked the local Mudanjiang City Petroleum Company to take delivery. However, the local petroleum company, not having ordered this batch of goods, did not want to take delivery without authorization. They contacted the Heilongjiang Province Petroleum Company, and the provincial company contacted the Shenyang Wholesale Station of the China Petroleum Company, and then the China Petroleum General Company. More than twenty long-distance phone calls and telegrams were exchanged before a decision was made to accept the goods, and they were also fined 13,773.3 yuan by the Railway Bureau.

　　Why was this batch of goods shipped from Lanzhou to Qujiang Station, then transferred to Mudanjiang, taking a journey of twenty-six days, without anyone claiming it? It turns out that there are two places named Qujiang in our country: one is Qujiang County in Guangdong Province, and the other is Qujiang Station, a station on the railway line from Mudanjiang to Tumen in Heilongjiang Province. This batch of gasoline was originally intended to be shipped to Qujiang County in Guangdong, but whether it was a mistake on the part of the shipper at the time of dispatch or an error on the part of the Railway Bureau, it ended up being shipped to Qujiang Station in Heilongjiang. In this way, not only was the state's manpower and financial resources wasted, but also the supply of gasoline needed by Qujiang County was delayed.

　　I believe this error is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of some staff members who are indifferent to the property of the state and the people. At present, our country is carrying out socialist construction, and the people of the whole country are launching a movement to increase production and practice economy to build our great motherland, while some units are creating waste, which is not permissible. I request the relevant supervisory authorities to investigate this incident and make appropriate handling.

### 运往广东的汽油送到了黑龙江

　　运往广东的汽油送到了黑龙江编辑同志：
    今年二月十三日，中国石油公司西北区公司采购供应站由兰州东站发出两车汽油，共七十三点五二三吨，发往曲江。
    货物从兰州东站发出后，路经宝鸡、郑州、山海关转到了黑龙江省的曲江，共计行程三千五百九十二公里，付承运费一万零八十四元八角。这批货经过这样远的路程，花了这样多的运费，但是到了曲江却无人收货。路局对这批无主的汽油也没有引起注意。不久，这批汽油又由曲江运到了牡丹江市（在三月二十一日到达牡丹江）。到了牡丹江以后，仍然无人认领。在这样情况下，牡丹江铁路局要当地的牡丹江市石油公司收下，当地石油公司因为没有订购这批货，不便贸然领取，就同黑龙江省石油公司联系，省公司又同中国石油公司沈阳批发站联系，后来又同中国石油总公司联系，共打了二十多次长途电话、电报，最后才决定收下了，同时还受到路局罚款一万三千七百七十三元三角。
    为什么这批货物由兰州运到曲江站，又转到牡丹江，经过了二十六天的旅程，而没有人收货呢？原来我国境内有两个曲江，一个是广东省的曲江县，另一个是在黑龙江省内由牡丹江往图门去的铁路线上的一个车站曲江站。这批汽油本来是运到广东的曲江县去的，不知是发货方面在发货当时弄错了呢，还是铁路局工作上的错误，结果，却运到黑龙江的曲江站。这样，不但浪费了国家的人力财力，同时也耽误了曲江县所需汽油的供应。
    我认为这种错误是同某些工作人员对待国家人民财产漠不关心的官僚主义作风分不开的。目前我们国家正在进行社会主义建设，全国人民正在开展增产节约运动来建设伟大祖国，而有些单位却在制造浪费，这是不能容许的。我要求各有关监察机关，检查这一事件并作出适当的处理。
