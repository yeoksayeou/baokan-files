Shandong Province Basically Completes Planting of Over 50 Million Mu of Major Autumn Crops

　　Shandong Province has basically completed planting of over 54 million mu of major autumn crops. Currently, sorghum, millet, corn, and other crops in the southern part of Shandong Province and the plains along the lower reaches of the Yellow River have sprouted tender leaves. Major autumn crops in the coastal areas of Jiaodong have also broken ground and sprouted.

　　At the beginning of this year's planting season in Shandong Province, drought was a widespread problem. Agricultural producers' cooperatives in various regions actively led farmers in combating drought and planting, adopting methods such as pressing the soil immediately after sowing and creating furrows to retain underground moisture. After rainfall in most areas in mid-April, farmers in various regions seized the opportunity to plant while the soil was moist. Before planting, farmers in various regions also promoted deep plowing and fine harrowing, the selection of improved varieties, and the prevention and control of underground pests, adapting their methods to local conditions. Over 44 percent of the province's major autumn crops used improved varieties, which generally yield more than ordinary varieties by over 10 percent.

　　Shandong Province established over 400 district-level agricultural technology extension stations before planting. These stations trained tens of thousands of agricultural technicians from agricultural producers' cooperatives, who played a significant role in improving planting techniques. Recently, the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture instructed various regions to combine thinning and weeding with seedling protection and checking work, ensuring drought resistance and seedling protection, as well as timely replanting and transplanting in areas with missing seedlings, in order to ensure full and robust seedling growth.

　　山东省五千多万亩大秋作物基本种完
    山东省五千四百多万亩大秋作物已基本种完。目前山东省南部和沿黄河下游两岸平原地区的高粱、谷子、玉米等都已长出嫩叶，胶东沿海地区的大秋作物也已破土抽芽。
    今年山东省播种开始时，普遍呈现旱象。各地农业生产合作社积极带动农民抗旱播种，并采取随播随压垅沟的办法，保持地下水分。四月中旬大部地区降雨后，各地农民又趁墒抢种。播种前，各地农民并因地制宜地推行深耕细耙、选用良种和防治地下虫害。全省有百分之四十四以上的大秋作物选用良种，一般产量都比普通品种高出一成以上。
    山东省在播种前新建了四百多处区的农业技术推广站。这些站训练出数万名农业生产合作社的农业技术员，他们在提高播种技术方面发挥了很大作用。最近山东省农业厅已指示各地结合间苗、锄草开展保苗、查苗工作，做到抗旱保苗和缺苗地及时补种、移苗，以保证苗全苗旺。（据新华社讯）
