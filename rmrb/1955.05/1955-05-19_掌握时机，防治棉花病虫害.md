　　Seize the Opportunity to Prevent and Control Cotton Pests and Diseases
　　Tian Jia

    This year, in addition to leading farmers to carry out general cotton pest and disease prevention and control work, cotton-producing areas plan to use new pesticides on 36,109,000 mu of land (based on figures compiled from provincial reports). Among them, 9,390,000 mu of cotton fields planted on state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives with a better foundation should fully utilize pesticides and machinery to achieve thorough prevention and control.

    Cotton aphids and pink bollworms are the most serious insect pests that endanger cotton production. In the northern cotton-producing areas, the control of cotton aphids should be carried out comprehensively before the wheat harvest, followed by continuous control according to the development of the insect pests. At the same time, this year, the area using "666" powder to control cotton aphids should be expanded, and comprehensive control methods such as clearing weeds and thinning seedlings should be combined to eliminate aphid damage. For pink bollworms, a combination of field control and overwintering control should be adopted, with key prevention and control measures. In overwintering control, in addition to spraying pesticides to kill insects and removing flower debris in ginning mills and flower collection stations, special attention should also be paid to the prevention and control work during the farmer's flower collection period. As for other cotton pests and diseases such as seedling diseases, spider mites, blind bugs, leaf rollers, and leafhoppers, cotton-producing areas should also determine key points and actively prevent and control them in a planned manner based on the patterns of past pest and disease occurrences and the specific conditions this year.

    This year, in the work of pest control in various cotton-producing areas, it is necessary to ensure timely prevention and control. At present, cotton aphids have begun to be found in cotton fields in some areas. According to inspections in Zhengzhou, Anyang, and other places in Henan Province, some early-winged cotton aphids flew to cotton fields successively at the end of April and rapidly reproduced in the cotton fields. In the past, many areas often failed to grasp the occurrence of cotton pests and diseases, and could not carry out prevention and control in a timely manner. Often, it was not until the leaves of the affected cotton plants had generally curled up that prevention and control began, resulting in poor results due to late action and missed opportunities for prevention and control. This year, cotton-producing areas should designate state-owned farms, experimental stations, specialized cotton farms, and other units to grasp the occurrence of pests and diseases and be responsible for issuing forecasts for pest and disease prevention and control. At the same time, cotton-producing areas should also focus on organizing well-established agricultural production cooperatives with agricultural technology extension stations as the center to establish mass pest reporting. In this year's cotton pest control work, we must remember the lessons of the past and seize the opportunity for prevention and control: prevent and control cotton aphids and spider mites before the cotton seedlings curl or turn red; the prevention and control of bollworms (cotton bollworm, pink bollworm, leaf roller, etc.) should be carried out during the peak budding period and before the pests bore into the cotton bolls.

    At present, cotton sowing has been completed, and cotton seedlings are emerging one after another. The agricultural departments in various cotton-producing areas must quickly assist the supply and marketing cooperatives in preparing, allocating, and repairing pesticides and machinery. With the rapid development of rural cooperativization and the increase in the supply of pest control agents, as well as the reduction in drug prices, the number of pest control agents used this year will inevitably increase. In this way, the existing powder spraying and mist spraying equipment will not be able to meet the needs of farmers. To overcome this difficulty, it is necessary to improve the existing pest control equipment, such as adding double nozzles to single-tube sprayers, modifying multi-head spray vehicles, etc. At the same time, attention should also be paid to giving play to the creativity of cotton farmers and adopting various methods to meet this need.

　　掌握时机，防治棉花病虫害
　　田稼
    今年各产棉区除了领导农民进行一般性的防治棉花病虫害工作外，计划使用新式药剂防治的面积将达三千六百一十万九千亩（根据各省报告汇总数字），其中要求在国营农场和基础较好的农业生产合作社种植的九百三十九万亩棉田上，充分运用药械，做到彻底防治。
    棉蚜和红铃虫是危害棉花生产最严重的虫害。北方产棉区在防治棉蚜工作中，应做到在麦收前普治一遍，随后根据虫害发展情况再进行连续防治。同时，今年应扩大用“六六六”粉防治棉蚜的面积，并结合清除杂草及间苗等综合防治方法，消灭蚜害。对红铃虫应采用田间防治和越冬防治相结合的办法，进行重点防治。在越冬防治中，除在轧花厂、收花站喷药杀虫和清除花渣外，农家收花期间的防治工作也要特别重视。至于其他棉花病虫害如：苗期病害、红蜘蛛、盲椿象、卷叶虫、叶跳虫等，各产棉区也应根据历年病虫害发生的规律和今年的具体情况，确定重点，有计划地积极防治。
    今年各产棉区在防治虫害工作中，必须做到防治及时。目前，有些地区的棉田已开始发现棉蚜。据河南省郑州、安阳等地检查，有些生翅较早的棉蚜在四月底就陆续飞往棉田，在棉田里迅速繁殖起来。过去不少地区常因掌握不住棉花病虫发生情况，而不能及早进行防治，往往等到被害棉株的叶子已经普遍卷起才开始防治，结果由于动手过迟，防治失时，效果不好。今年各产棉区应指定国营农场、试验站、专业棉场等单位，掌握病虫发生情况，负责发布防治病虫的预报。同时，各产棉区还应该以农业技术推广站为中心，重点组织基础好的农业生产合作社，建立群众性的虫情报告。今年在防治棉虫工作中，一定要记取过去的教训，掌握防治时机：防治棉蚜、红蜘蛛应在棉苗未卷叶、红叶前；蕾铃期害虫（棉铃虫、红铃虫、卷叶虫等）的防治工作应在显蕾盛期和害虫未蛀入棉铃以前进行。
    目前棉花已播种完毕，棉苗陆续出土，各产棉区的农业部门要迅速协助供销合作社做好药械的准备、调拨、修理等工作。随着农村合作化的迅速发展和治虫药剂供应量的增多，以及药价的降低，今年使用治虫药剂的数量必然增加。这样，现有的喷粉、喷雾器械就不能满足农民的需要。要克服这一困难，就必须对现有治虫器械加以改进，如单管喷雾器加双喷头、改装多头的喷雾车等，同时还应注意发挥棉农的创造性，采用各种办法来满足这一需要。
