With the implementation of these decisions, the face of the Tibetan region will undergo even greater changes. We must commemorate this festival with practical actions that strengthen national work, strengthen the study of national policies, and strengthen unity among and within all nationalities.

Through the efforts of the Tibetan people themselves, the economy and culture of the Tibetan region have gradually developed.

The Tibetan region has abundant mineral resources, forests, and vast grasslands. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the State Council, and with the support of the people of all nationalities across the country, the Tibetan people will surely unite closely, bring into play their infinite wisdom and strength, build Tibet into a prosperous and happy new Tibet, and will certainly be able to contribute to the cause of building a great motherland.
