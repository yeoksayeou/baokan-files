Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 15th: Polish People's Republic Minister of Council Chairman Józef Cyrankiewicz delivered the closing remarks at the Warsaw Conference on European countries ensuring European peace and security.

Cyrankiewicz said that we have completed the tasks facing the Warsaw Conference by signing the historically significant Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance and the resolution on the Joint Command. We have established an effective system of cooperation and mutual assistance between free, equal, and friendly countries. This system demonstrates the close unity of peace-loving countries in their efforts to defend Europe from the threat of German militarism in West Germany. The conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance lays an unshakable foundation for our joint actions to ensure European peace and security.

Cyrankiewicz continued by saying that we are not establishing an exclusive bloc targeting any country or group of countries by concluding this treaty. Our treaty is open to all countries, regardless of their social or political systems. We have been and are against dividing Europe into hostile camps. The purpose of our treaty is to guarantee lasting peace. But at the same time, we will ensure that we have various means to repel all attempts at aggression and give the aggressor a lesson they will never forget.

Cyrankiewicz emphasized that a fact of great significance regarding this treaty is that the powerful Soviet Union is a participant in the treaty. In our struggle against the danger of new aggression, it is of great significance that the representative of the People's Republic of China is participating in our conference as an observer. The People's Republic of China fully supports and fully aids the purposes and principles of the treaty concluded here. Today, the powerful peace camp, with its nine hundred million people and stretching from the Elbe River to the Pacific Ocean, is filled with the will to fight for peace.

Cyrankiewicz said that the Polish people, who have suffered deeply from Nazi aggression and know the goals of the Bonn revanchists, fully recognize the historical significance of this treaty. The Warsaw Treaty strengthens our defense capabilities and strengthens our sense of security.

Cyrankiewicz concluded by asking the representatives of the countries participating in the Warsaw Conference to convey the most sincere wishes of the Polish people to the people of their respective countries.

　　西伦凯维兹在华沙会议上致闭幕词
    新华社华沙十五日电  波兰人民共和国部长会议主席约·西伦凯维兹在欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全的华沙会议上致闭幕词。
    西伦凯维兹说，我们在具有历史意义的友好合作互助条约和关于联合司令部的决议上签了字，从而完成了华沙会议面临的任务。我们在自由、平等和友好的国家之间建立了一个有效的合作互助体系。这个体系说明了爱好和平的国家在保卫受到西德的德国军国主义威胁的欧洲方面所作的努力的紧密团结。友好合作互助条约的缔结为我们的保障欧洲和平和安全的共同行动奠定了不可动摇的基础。
    西伦凯维兹接着说，我们缔结这个条约并不是成立一个针对任何国家或国家集团的排他性集团。我们的条约是对一切国家——不论它们的社会制度和政治制度如何——开着门的。我们过去是现在还是反对把欧洲分裂成敌对的阵营。我们的条约的目的是保证持久和平。但是同时，我们将保证我们自己有各种方法来击退各种侵略尝试并给侵略者一个叫他忘记不了的教训。
    西伦凯维兹强调说，关于这个条约的一个具有重大意义的事实就是强大的苏联是条约的一个参加国。在我们反对新侵略危险的斗争中，具有重大意义的事实是：我们的会议有中华人民共和国的代表以观察员的身份参加。中华人民共和国完全支持和完全支援在这里缔结的条约的宗旨和原则。今天拥有九亿人口和从易北河伸展到太平洋的土地上的强大的和平阵营，充满着争取和平的意志。
    西伦凯维兹说，曾深受纳粹侵略之苦、并且知道波恩复仇主义者的目标的波兰人民，充分认识到这个条约的历史性意义。华沙条约加强了我们的防卫力量，加强了我们的安全感。
    西伦凯维兹最后要求参加华沙会议的各国代表把波兰人民的最诚挚的祝愿转达给自己国家的人民。
