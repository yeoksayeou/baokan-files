　　State-Run Friendship Farm Begins Reclamation on May 2nd
    The state-run Friendship Farm began reclamation on May 2nd. The commencement ceremony was held at a field work station, with portraits of Chairman Mao and Bulganin hanging on the production team's mobile living quarters. The national flags of China and the Soviet Union fluttered in the warm spring breeze. All around the field was a flat and open wilderness.
    The person in charge of the state-run Friendship Farm, Soviet experts acting as farm advisors, and representatives from various branch farms attended the reclamation ceremony. Wang Caoli, the farm manager, said at the ceremony: The Party and the government have entrusted us with the glorious task of reclamation, and we are starting to carry it out today. Whether we can increase grain production for the country, set an example for farmers, play a due role in the socialist transformation of agriculture, and provide experience for large-scale land reclamation in our country in the future, all depend on the reclamation work that is starting now. He demanded that all employees of the farm resolutely implement the suggestions of the Soviet experts and complete this year's reclamation task within two months.
    Nikolenko, the chief advisor to the farm manager, spoke at the meeting, encouraging all Soviet experts and farm employees to exert their greatest work capacity during the reclamation and complete the reclamation task on schedule. Kruglikov, the chief agricultural technician advisor, also spoke at the meeting, expressing his determination to make the land that has never grown a single grain grow grain, support China's industrialization, and improve the lives of the Chinese people.
    Liu Baoqing, the secretary of the Provisional General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the State-Run Friendship Farm, called on all Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members at the meeting to take the lead and play a backbone role in the reclamation work, unite the masses, learn from advanced Soviet experience, and transform the wasteland into fertile land within two months.
    At the meeting, Dong Yanlan, a female tractor driver of "C-80" tractor from the Second Production Team of the First Branch Farm, gave a guarantee on behalf of all employees of the First Branch Farm: to complete the reclamation of 4,500 hectares of their branch farm within fifty days, at a reclamation speed of ninety hectares per day.
    After the meeting, the tractor drivers quickly jumped onto their tractors, and a roar immediately resounded. On the No. 6 "C-80" tractor, which was the first to set off, a red flag was fluttering in the wind, with the words "Strive to complete the reclamation of 20,000 hectares before 'July 1st'." Immediately afterwards, the other nine tractors also moved forward in parallel with this tractor on the wasteland. The black soil turned over under the plow, and furrows began to appear on the fertile wilderness.

　　国营友谊农场五月二日开始开荒
    国营友谊农场在五月二日开始开荒。开荒典礼在一个田间作业站举行，生产队宿营车上挂着毛主席和布尔加宁的画像，中苏两国的国旗在温暖的春风里飘扬。全场四周是平坦空旷的原野。
    国营友谊农场负责人、农场顾问苏联专家和各分场代表参加了开荒典礼。场长王操犁在典礼会上讲话说：党和政府交给我们光荣的开荒任务，我们今天开始执行了。能否给国家增产粮食、能否向农民示范、并在农业社会主义改造中起应有的推动作用，以及能否给今后我国大规模开垦荒地提供经验，都决定于目前开始的开荒工作。他要求全场职工坚决地贯彻苏联专家的建议，在两个月内完成今年的开荒任务。
    农场场长总顾问尼科连科在会上讲了话，勉励全场苏联专家和农场职工在开荒中发挥最大的工作能力，按期完成开荒任务。农业总技师顾问克鲁基科夫也在会上讲话，表示要使从来没有结过一颗粮食的土地生长出粮食来，支援中国的工业化，改善中国人民的生活。
    中国共产党国营友谊农场临时总支委员会书记刘宝庆在会上号召全场共产党员和青年团员在开荒工作中起带头、骨干作用，团结群众，学习苏联先进经验，在两个月内把荒地变成良田。
    会上，第一分场第二生产队“C—八十号”女拖拉机手董延兰代表第一分场全体职工提出保证：以每天完成九十公顷的开荒速度，在五十天内完成他们分场四千五百公顷的开荒任务。
    大会结束后，拖拉机手们迅速地跳上了拖拉机，立即响起一片轰鸣声。第一台开出的第六号“C—八十号”拖拉机上，一面写着“为在‘七一’前完成二万公顷开荒任务而奋斗”的红旗迎风招展。紧接着，其他九台拖拉机也和这台拖拉机相平行地在荒地上前进。黑色的泥土在犁铧下翻过身来，肥沃的原野上开始出现了一道道的犁沟。（新华社）
