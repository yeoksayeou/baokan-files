Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, May 8th:

　　The people of Lüda City, numbering over 110,000, held a grand rally at Stalin Square in Lüda City on the morning of the 8th to see off the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area returning home.

　　On the rostrum, the national flags of China and the Soviet Union were displayed. Facing the rostrum, giant portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Bulganin were hung on the wall of the building, along with two red banners bearing the slogans: "The great alliance between China and the Soviet Union is a reliable guarantee for safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world!" and "Thank you for the profound friendship of the Soviet army in defeating the Japanese aggressors and helping our people gain liberation!"

　　Participants in the farewell rally included representatives from Lüda City's workers, farmers, students, residents, and troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Lushunkou area. As the representatives of the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area entered the venue, the music "Moscow-Beijing" was played on the square, and a storm of applause and cheers erupted from the crowd.

　　At 9:00 AM, the farewell rally began. The band played the national anthems of the Soviet Union and China. Subsequently, Guo Shushen, Secretary of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee, delivered a speech at the rally. Guo Shushen first extended a warm farewell and heartfelt gratitude to all officers and soldiers of the Soviet troops on behalf of the entire people of Lüda City. He said: During their stationing in the Lushunkou area, the heroic Soviet troops made great contributions to safeguarding our country's security and preserving peace in the Far East and the world, and they have consistently shown ardent care and assistance to the people of Lüda. We will never forget this great friendship and assistance. Guo Shushen then said: Now, as you are about to leave our country after completing your glorious mission, each of us is filled with indescribable feelings of reluctance. The profound friendship forged between the people of China and the Soviet Union in struggle will be passed down through generations and last forever. Guo Shushen concluded by saying: After the heroic Soviet troops withdraw to their country, the people of Lüda will redouble our vigilance, strengthen our national defense awareness, diligently learn from the Soviet Union, actively participate in the country's socialist industrialization and the modernization of national defense, and unite with the Chinese People's Liberation Army to consolidate the Lushunkou naval base with all our strength.

　　A representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Lushunkou area spoke at the rally. He said: According to the decision of the Sino-Soviet talks in October 1954, our army was ordered to take over the entire defense of the Lushunkou area. The Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area not only handed over all the solid military facilities they had painstakingly built over the past ten years to our army completely and undamaged without compensation, but also unreservedly imparted their valuable experience to our army. We must, on the basis of the hard work of the Soviet army over the past ten years, unite with the people of the Lüda area, continue to strengthen the defense of the Lushunkou naval base, strive to study and master various equipment, and constantly heighten our vigilance to strictly prevent any provocations and invasions by the enemy. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the support of the 600 million people of the country, we will surely be able to complete the glorious task of guarding Lushunkou.

　　A representative of the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area delivered a farewell speech, saying: In handing over the defense of the Lushunkou naval base to our comrades-in-arms, the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Soviet soldiers are fully confident that you will vigilantly defend the peace and security of your motherland and will not allow any enemy to disrupt the free and happy labor of your people. He said that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all countries in the socialist camp are pursuing a policy of peace. We believe that the two systems—capitalism and socialism—can coexist peacefully for a long time. What we are particularly concerned about and hope for is that the people of the world will live together peacefully and friendly. However, the warmongers must know that if they dare to impose a new war on mankind, then their end will be extremely tragic. He concluded by saying: The great Chinese people can completely trust us; the Chinese people will always receive the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet people.

　　After the speeches, Guo Shushen, Secretary of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee, Song Li, Mayor of Lüda City, and representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Lushunkou area presented two silk banners to the Soviet troops. Representatives of the Soviet troops' headquarters in the Lushunkou area presented a silk banner to the people of Lüda City and a delicate cannon model to the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Lushunkou area. Subsequently, twenty-five representatives of workers, farmers, and students from Lüda City presented flowers to representatives of the Soviet troops' headquarters in the Lushunkou area. The farewell rally then came to a close.

　　After the rally, people from all walks of life who participated in the rally enthusiastically swarmed to the Soviet troops to shake hands, hug, sign autographs, and take photos with them as the band played "Moscow-Beijing." Many people presented souvenirs to the Soviet troops. As the Soviet troops marched past the rostrum in formation to leave the venue, everyone present applauded, waved, and shouted slogans such as "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" "Thank you to the Soviet troops!" "Farewell to the Soviet troops returning home!"

　　旅大市举行欢送苏军回国大会
    新华社旅大八日电　旅大市各界人民十一万多人，八日上午在旅大市斯大林广场举行盛大的欢送驻旅顺口地区苏军回国大会。
    主席台上，插着中苏两国国旗，面对主席台大厦的墙上悬挂着毛泽东主席、布尔加宁主席的巨幅画像和两幅红色的横额标语。标语上写着：“中苏两国的伟大同盟是维护远东和世界和平的可靠保证！”、“感谢苏军击败日本侵略者，帮助我国人民获得解放的深厚友情！”
    参加欢送大会的有旅大市职工、农民、学生、居民和中国人民解放军驻旅顺口地区部队的代表。当驻旅顺口地区苏军代表们进入会场时，广场上奏起“莫斯科—北京”的乐曲，群众行列中发出暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声。
    上午九时，欢送大会开始。乐队高奏苏中两国国歌。接着，中共旅大市委员会书记郭述申在会上致词。郭述申首先代表旅大市全体人民，向苏军部队全体将士，表示热烈的欢送和衷心的感谢。他说：英勇的苏军在驻防旅顺口地区的期间，对保卫我国安全、保卫远东和世界和平作了伟大的贡献，对于旅大人民给予了始终如一的热忱的关怀和援助。对于这种伟大的友谊援助，我们将永世不忘。郭述申接着说：现在，当你们完成了光荣使命就要离开我们国家的时候，我们每一个人都充满着难以形容的留恋之情。中苏两国人民在斗争中所结成的深厚友谊，将世代相传，万古长青。郭述申最后说：我们旅大人民在英勇的苏军撤退回国以后，一定要百倍地提高警惕，加强国防观念，努力向苏联学习，积极参加国家的社会主义工业化和国防现代化的建设，和中国人民解放军团结一致，以全力来巩固旅顺口海军根据地。
    中国人民解放军驻旅顺口地区部队代表在会上讲话。他说：根据中苏两国一九五四年十月中苏会谈的决定，我军奉命接收旅顺口地区全部防务。驻旅顺口地区苏军不仅把自己十年来所辛勤经营的坚固的军事设备全部无偿地完整无损地交给我军，而且把自己宝贵的经验毫无保留地传授给我军。我们要在苏军十年来辛勤建设的基础上，和旅大地区人民团结一致，继续加强旅顺口海军根据地的防务，努力研究和掌握各种设备，时刻提高警惕，严防敌人的任何挑衅和侵袭。我们坚信：在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，在全国六亿人民的支援下，我们一定能够完成守卫旅顺口的光荣任务。
    驻旅顺口地区苏军部队代表致告别词说：在把旅顺口海军根据地的防务交给我们的战友——中国人民解放军战士的时候，苏联军人完全相信你们能够警惕地保卫自己祖国的和平与安全，不许任何敌人破坏你们人民的自由和幸福的劳动。他说，苏联、中华人民共和国以及社会主义阵营的所有国家，都奉行着爱好和平的政策。我们认为两个体系——资本主义与社会主义能够长期和平共处。我们所特别关怀的和希望的是世界人民和平友好相处。但是，战争贩子们必须知道，如果他们竟敢把新战争强加在人类的头上，那末，他们的下场将是极其悲惨的。他最后说：伟大的中国人民完全可以信任我们，中国人民永远会得到苏联人民的兄弟般的无私的援助。
    讲话毕，中共旅大市委员会书记郭述申、旅大市市长宋黎和中国人民解放军驻旅顺口地区部队代表向苏军赠送两面锦旗。驻旅顺口地区苏军指挥部代表向旅大市各界人民赠送一面锦旗，向中国人民解放军驻旅顺口地区部队赠送一座精致的大炮模型。接着，旅大市的职工、农民、学生等代表二十五人向驻旅顺口地区苏军指挥部代表献花。欢送大会到此结束。
    会后，参加大会的各界人民在乐队奏起“莫斯科—北京”的歌声中，热情地蜂拥到苏军面前，和苏军互相握手、拥抱、签字和合影留念。许多人向苏军赠送了纪念礼品。在苏军整队绕过主席台退场时，全场的人们都鼓掌、挥手，并欢呼“中苏友好万岁！”“感谢苏军！”“欢送苏军回国！”等口号。
