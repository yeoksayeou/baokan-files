Conscientiously Run Joint State-Private Enterprises

　　At present, there are nearly two thousand joint state-private enterprises across the country. Most of them have achieved great success, demonstrating the superiority of joint state-private enterprises and proving that using joint state-private ownership as the primary form of socialist transformation of capitalist industry is entirely correct.

　　However, joint state-private ownership is, after all, a new task and a very complex one. To do a good job in joint operation, attention must be paid to many aspects of relationships and problems. The current general situation is that production is emphasized, but not enough attention is paid to state-private relations; more attention is paid to enterprise transformation, but less attention is paid to the transformation of bourgeois elements in conjunction with enterprise transformation. In some places, leading organs focus their attention on the expansion of newly jointly operated enterprises, while relaxing leadership over existing jointly operated enterprises. Therefore, in terms of state-private relations, the leadership position of the state has not yet been established in some enterprises, and the legitimate rights and interests of the private sector are not sufficiently respected in many enterprises. Some capitalists attempt to seize leadership, while others adopt a passive attitude. Regarding the transformation of bourgeois elements, there are phenomena of both failing to adhere to principles and engage in principled struggle, and of putting capitalists aside or squeezing them out. If these situations are not given attention and attempts are not made to change them, it will affect the further consolidation and improvement of jointly operated enterprises and will be detrimental to the cause of socialist transformation.

　　To change this situation, the first thing is to adjust the state-private relationship, to establish the leadership position of the state while respecting the legitimate rights and interests of the private sector, and to educate and transform private sector personnel. Joint state-private enterprises are enterprises in which socialist components cooperate with capitalist components within the enterprise, with the socialist components in a leading position. This brings about important changes in the relations of production within the enterprise, the status of workers in the enterprise also changes, and the distribution of enterprise profits, in addition to stipulating an appropriate portion to be used for paying dividends to shareholders, can be reasonably used according to national plans to develop production and improve employee welfare facilities. The leading position of socialist components within the enterprise is not determined by the amount of state investment in the enterprise, but by the leading position of the socialist economy in the entire national economy, by the nature of state power, and by the combination of public shareholder representatives with the masses of workers and the education and transformation of capitalists and their agents. Some cadres believe that "the proportion of state shares must account for at least half to be in a leading position" and that "the greater the proportion of state shares in the enterprise, the more consolidated the leading position" are wrong ideas. Some capitalists attempt to "combine public operation for private gain" or use other methods to seize leadership in joint ventures, which must never be allowed. However, after confirming the leading position of socialist components, it is also necessary to guarantee the interests of the private sector, so that they have duties and powers; to urge them to perform their duties and responsibilities, actively run the enterprise well, and help them achieve success in their work. The "Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises" promulgated by the Government Administration Council on September 2, 1954, have made clear provisions for the correct handling of state-private relations. It is a guideline that both parties should jointly abide by, and neither party can violate it.

　　The method of coordinating state-private relations is the method of consultation. Since 1949, we have gained a lot of experience in consultation in all aspects of our work, and this experience should be further applied to joint state-private enterprises. At present, some cadres lack a proper understanding of the Party's united front policy and its importance in their attitude towards the bourgeoisie. Their thinking fluctuates between the left and the right, with the "rather left than right" mentality currently dominating, thus hindering the development of consultation work. Some cadres believe that dealing with capitalists means an unstable stance, so they avoid them, and even ignore the capitalists' positive suggestions. Some cadres dare not criticize the capitalists, lose vigilance, and are even afraid that studying the general line will stimulate the capitalists. Individual cadres have even been corrupted by the capitalists. We must overcome this bias.

　　We should attach importance to enterprise transformation, but we must also attach importance to human transformation. Both enterprise transformation and human transformation are socialist transformations. If we only pay attention to enterprise transformation and do not pay attention to human transformation, then in the future, when the economic transformation is complete but people remain unchanged, it will increase difficulties in gradually replacing private ownership with ownership by the whole people. Of course, the transformation of people must be carried out in conjunction with the specific work of joint ventures. This requires doing a good job in several aspects: implementing the state's policy of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the bourgeoisie, and handling personnel arrangements, inventory of assets and determination of shares, and profit distribution in accordance with policies; matters that should be promoted or reformed within the enterprise should be fully consulted with the private sector in advance as much as possible; allocate appropriate work to them according to the capabilities and positions of the capitalists, so that they have things to do, and have duties, powers, and responsibilities; if there are difficulties, they should be helped to solve them, if there are shortcomings, they should be pointed out, if there are mistakes, they should be criticized, and if there are achievements, they should be appropriately praised and encouraged. We should unite and use the progressive elements among capitalists, capitalist agents, and senior staff, lead and help the middle elements to do their job well, promote the progress of backward elements, and sanction reactionary elements who resolutely resist in accordance with the law. The transformation of bourgeois elements should focus on ideological education, so that they love the country and abide by the law, accept socialist transformation, accept the leadership of socialist components, and accept the supervision of the workers, so as to gradually transform their old ideas.

　　The operation and management of joint state-private enterprises must gradually implement the management policies of socialist enterprises, and cannot follow the management policies of capitalist enterprises. That is to say, not simply pursuing profits, but obeying the national plan. Although the operation and management of existing joint state-private enterprises have undergone a certain degree of transformation, due to the long-term capitalist management methods in the past, phenomena of production chaos and no one being responsible still exist to varying degrees. This requires gradually reforming the old capitalist operation and management system and promoting the advanced socialist operation and management system. It is necessary to implement democratic management and promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. Production plans should be formulated according to needs and possibilities, gradually implement planned management, and around the completion of the production plan, focus on and step-by-step refer to the experience of state-owned factories to establish and reform certain necessary organizational and technical measures. As for the chaotic and unreasonable wage system brought about by the old enterprises, as well as the poor conditions of employee welfare facilities in some enterprises, they must also be gradually reformed and gradually brought in line with comparable state-owned enterprises. However, the reform of operation and management must pay attention to preventing the bias of not proceeding from reality and demanding excessive or hasty progress. We must pay attention to the characteristics of joint ventures and move forward steadily, without being impetuous.

　　The production of joint state-private enterprises must obey the national plan. Some enterprises, after joint operation, blindly increase output regardless of the balance of supply and demand, resulting in a decline in product quality. This has aggravated the difficulty of balancing supply and demand. The production of joint ventures must implement the policy of "reforming operation and management, saving raw materials, improving quality, and reducing costs." At the same time, it must be seen that not all enterprises will make money after joint operation. Enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood and have good technical conditions will mostly have surpluses after joint operation; but a considerable number of enterprises with poor conditions may not immediately have surpluses after joint operation. Some enterprises had insufficient production tasks before joint operation, so after joint operation, these enterprises must be slowly transformed over a period of time.

　　In order to do a good job in joint state-private operation, it is necessary to strengthen the work of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and trade unions in enterprises, and rely closely on the awareness and organization of the workers. This is the foundation for running joint state-private enterprises well. At present, the work in this area is still very weak. In some joint ventures, the Party, the Communist Youth League, and trade unions still have their own way of doing things, and there is a lack of strong bottom-up supervision in the enterprise. In order to change this situation, it is urgent to strengthen the leadership of Party committees at all levels over joint state-private enterprises. We must not only pay attention to the completion of enterprise production tasks, but also strengthen the inspection of the implementation of state-private relations policies, and conduct systematic policy education and class education among the workers, so that they understand the importance of transforming capitalist enterprises through joint state-private operation, and the glorious and huge tasks that the workers bear in this cause.

　　The number of capitalists in joint state-private enterprises who can work actively after the enterprise is jointly operated is currently increasing. We welcome these people and hope that they will be more active and further improve the work of socialist transformation. However, there are also some people who, after the enterprise is jointly operated, still have resistance to the leadership of public representatives and the supervision of the workers, and even work negatively and perfunctorily, which must be corrected and stopped.

　　Joint state-private enterprises have great advantages over private enterprises. They provide the possibility of strengthening planning, improving production, improving operation and management, and running enterprises well within the enterprise. But to turn this possibility into reality requires the joint efforts of both the state and private sectors and the workers.

### 认真办好公私合营企业

　　认真办好公私合营企业
    现在全国有公私合营企业近二千家，大部分办得很有成绩，显示了公私合营企业的优越性，证明了以公私合营作为对资本主义工业实行社会主义改造的主要形式，是完全正确的。
    但是，公私合营毕竟是一项新的工作，也是一项十分复杂的工作。要作好合营工作，必须注意很多方面的关系和问题。目前一般的情况是，重视了生产，但对公私关系重视不够；对企业改造注意得比较多，结合企业改造对资产阶级分子进行改造注意得比较少。领导机关在有些地方注意力集中在新合营企业的扩展，放松了对原有合营企业的领导。因而在公私关系上，有些企业中公方领导地位还没有确立，许多的企业中对私方权益尊重不够。有些资本家企图争夺领导权，有的则采取消极态度。对资产阶级分子的改造，既存在着不能坚持立场进行原则斗争的现象，也存在着把资本家摆在一边、或挤出去的做法。这些情况如果不加以重视，并设法改变，就会影响合营企业的进一步巩固和提高，不利于社会主义改造事业。
    要改变这种情况，首先就是要调整好公私关系，既要确立公方的领导地位，同时也要尊重私方的合法权益，教育和改造私方人员。公私合营企业是社会主义成分在企业内部同资本主义成分合作的企业，社会主义成分居于领导地位，因此它使企业的生产关系发生了重要的变化，工人在企业中的地位也有改变，企业利润的分配除了规定适当的部分用来发付股东股息红利以外，其余就可以按国家计划合理地加以使用，以发展生产，改善职工福利设施。社会主义成分在企业内的领导地位，不决定于国家在这个企业中投资的数量，而是取决于社会主义经济在整个国民经济中的领导地位，取决于国家政权的性质，取决于公股代表同工人群众的结合和对资本家及其代理人的教育、改造。有些干部认为“公股比重至少要占一半才能居于领导地位”、“企业中公股比重愈大领导地位愈巩固”的想法是错误的。有些资本家企图在合营企业中“合公营私”，或者用其他方法企图争夺领导权，也是决不能允许的。但在确认了社会主义成分的领导地位以后，同时要保证私方的利益，使他们有职有权；要督促他们守职尽责，积极办好企业，并帮助他们在工作中做出成绩。一九五四年九月二日政务院公布的“公私合营工业企业暂行条例”对于正确处理公私关系已作了明确的规定，它是公私双方应当共同遵守的准则，任何一方都不能违反。
    协调公私关系的方法就是协商的方法。从一九四九年以来，我们在各方面工作中，都取得了很多协商的经验，这些经验应该进一步运用到公私合营企业中去。目前有些干部在对待资产阶级的态度上，对党的统一战线政策及其重要性缺乏应有的正确认识，思想上忽左忽右，而宁左勿右的思想目前占着主导的地位，因而妨害了协商工作的开展。有的干部认为同资本家打交道就是立场不稳，因而远而避之，甚至对资本家的积极建议，也置之不理。也有些干部对资本家不敢批评，失去警惕，甚至怕学习总路线会刺激了资本家，个别干部还被资本家所腐蚀。我们必须克服这种偏向。
    我们应该重视企业改造，但也必须重视人的改造。企业改造和人的改造都是社会主义改造。我们如果只重视企业改造，不注意对人的改造，将来经济上改造好了，而人还原封未动，那末在逐步用全民所有制去代替私人所有制的时候就将增加困难。当然，对人的改造必须结合着合营企业的各项具体工作来进行。这就需要做好几方面的工作：贯彻国家保护资产阶级合法权益的政策，对人事安排、清产定股、利润分配方面必须按政策办事；企业内部应兴应革的事，尽可能要在事前和私方充分协商；根据资方的能力、职位，分配他们以适当的工作，使他们有事可做，有职有权有责；有困难应当帮助他们解决，有缺点应指出，有错误应批评，有成绩应适当表扬和鼓励。对资本家、资方代理人、高级职员中的进步分子要团结、使用，对中间分子要领导和帮助他们做好工作，对落后分子要推动他们进步，对坚决反抗的反动分子应依法制裁。对资产阶级分子的改造，应抓紧思想教育，使他们爱国守法、接受社会主义改造、接受社会主义成分的领导，接受职工群众的监督，以此逐步改造他们旧有的思想。
    公私合营企业的经营管理，必须逐步推行社会主义企业的经营管理方针，不能沿用资本主义企业的经营管理方针。这就是说，不是单纯追求利润，而要服从国家计划。现有公私合营企业的经营管理，虽已经过了一定程度的改造，但由于过去长期是一套资本主义的经营管理方式，所以，生产混乱、无人负责的现象，还程度不同地存在着。这就必须逐步改革旧的资本主义的经营管理制度，推行社会主义的先进的经营管理制度。要实行民主管理，发扬工人群众的积极性和创造性。要根据需要和可能订立生产计划，逐步实行计划管理，并围绕完成生产计划，有重点有步骤地参照国营工厂经验，建立和改革某些必要的组织和技术措施。至于旧企业带来的混乱和不合理的工资制度，以及有些企业职工福利设施的恶劣状况，也必须逐步加以改革，逐步向相当的国营企业看齐。但经营管理的改革，必须注意防止不从实际出发，要求过高过急的偏向，必须注意合营企业的特点，稳步前进，不可急躁从事。
    公私合营企业的生产必须服从国家的计划。有些企业在合营以后，不顾供销平衡，盲目增加产量，因而产品质量下降。这就加重了供销平衡的困难。合营企业的生产，必须贯彻“改革经营管理，节约原材料，提高质量，降低成本”的方针。同时还必须看到，企业合营后不可能都是赚钱的。对国计民生有利、技术条件又好的企业，合营以后大都会有盈余；但相当数量条件差的，合营以后不一定立即会有盈余。有一些企业在合营前，生产任务就是不足的，所以，这些企业合营以后，必须经过一个时期慢慢地把它们改造过来。
    为了做好公私合营工作，必须加强企业中党、团、工会工作，紧紧依靠职工群众的觉悟性和组织性。这是办好公私合营企业的基础。目前这方面的工作还很薄弱，有些合营企业中的党、团和工会还有各自为政的现象，在企业中还缺乏自下而上的强有力的监督。为了改变这种情况，亟应加强各级党委对公私合营企业的领导，我们不只要重视企业生产任务的完成，还要加强对公私关系政策执行的检查，并在工人群众中进行系统的政策教育和阶级教育，使他们懂得经过公私合营这种方式对资本主义企业进行改造的重要意义，以及工人群众在这项事业中担负着光荣、巨大的任务。
    公私合营企业中的资本家在企业合营以后能够积极工作的，目前正在增多，我们欢迎这些人，希望他们更加积极，进一步做好社会主义改造工作。但也有一些人在企业合营以后，对公方代表的领导和职工群众的监督还有抵触情绪，甚至消极怠工，这是必须纠正和制止的。
    公私合营企业对于私营企业来说是具有很大优越性的，它提供了在企业内部加强计划性、改进生产、改进经营管理、办好企业的可能。但是要把这种可能变为现实，还需要公私双方和职工群众的共同努力。
