The peace-loving people of the world welcome the historically significant achievements of the Warsaw Conference. At this conference, eight European countries, in order to ensure peace and security in Europe, signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, and adopted a resolution on the establishment of a Joint Command of the Armed Forces. The achievements of the Warsaw Conference strengthened the friendship and cooperation between the peace-loving countries of Europe and fully demonstrated the great, unbreakable unity and growing strength of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp. The resolute actions taken by European peace-loving countries to strengthen their defense forces are a major contribution to safeguarding peace in Europe and the world. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the success of the conference.

It is well known that the Western countries, despite repeated warnings from the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe, approved the Paris Agreements and are implementing them. The final communiqu√© of the Warsaw Conference pointed out that "the ratification of the Paris Agreements increases the danger of a new war and poses a threat to the national security of peace-loving countries." This is evident to everyone. According to the provisions of the Paris Agreements, Western countries are remilitarizing West Germany and dragging it into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and the new military bloc of the so-called "Western European Union," which are directed against the Soviet Union and the European people's democracies. This action by Western countries seriously hinders the unification of Germany and endangers peace in Europe and the world. In order to deal with this serious threat from Western countries, European peace-loving countries signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance at the Warsaw Conference. This treaty stipulates that if any state or group of states in Europe engages in armed attack against one or more of the contracting parties, each contracting party shall exercise the right of individual or collective self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. The treaty also provides for the establishment of a Joint Command of the Armed Forces to command the armed forces allocated to this command by the contracting parties. The contracting parties will also take the necessary coordinated measures to strengthen their defense capabilities in order to safeguard the peaceful labor of their people, guarantee the inviolability of their borders and territories, and ensure defense against possible aggression. The defensive nature of the Eight-Nation Treaty is obviously very clear. This treaty is not only a necessary step to ensure the security of the contracting states themselves, but also a powerful pillar for maintaining peace in Europe and the world.

Grotewohl, head of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, stated at the Warsaw Conference that the unification of Germany on the basis of the principles of peace and democracy is the main task of the German Democratic Republic and all the German people. He pointed out that the Eight-Nation Treaty is "a great help to the German people's efforts to unify Germany in a peaceful and democratic manner." Grotewohl's statement expressed the common demands and common understanding of the German people and the peace-loving people of the world. Ten years have passed since the end of the war. During these long years, despite the tireless efforts of the Soviet Union and European peace-loving countries, and despite the continuous struggle of the German Democratic Republic and the German people in all aspects, German unification has still not been achieved. The Western bloc, headed by the United States, has consistently insisted on dividing Germany, wanting to turn West Germany into their war front. Obviously, only when the forces of peace are stronger will it be possible to make the forces of war more sober. Therefore, the Eight-Nation Treaty will certainly be of great help to the German people in unifying their country on the basis of peaceful and democratic principles. Of course, completing the task of unifying Germany depends first and foremost on the efforts of the patriotic forces of the German people themselves.

The Warsaw Treaty is in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and is an effective tool for ensuring international peace and security. The treaty stipulates that the contracting parties guarantee in their international relations to refrain from the threat or use of force and to resolve international disputes by peaceful means. The treaty also stipulates that all other countries, regardless of their social and state systems, may join this treaty. In this spirit, the treaty reaffirms the contracting parties' hope to establish a European collective security system on the basis of the participation of all countries in Europe, in order to unite their efforts to safeguard peace in Europe; and stipulates that the Eight-Nation Treaty shall cease to be effective from the date of entry into force of the All-European Treaty. The Eight-Nation Treaty also stipulates that the contracting parties will, in agreement with other countries willing to cooperate, take effective measures for universal arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. All of this shows that the Warsaw Treaty is a peace treaty. It is an alliance for maintaining peace based on the principles of equality, mutual respect for national sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs, established by the contracting states for common purposes and interests.

Obviously, the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed by the European peace-loving countries, and the organization established in accordance with this treaty, are fundamentally different from the military alliance treaties and military aggression blocs between imperialist countries. The North Atlantic aggressive bloc, the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, and the Turko-Iraqi military agreement, all manipulated by the United States, are tools serving the war policies of the major imperialist countries, mainly the US aggressive bloc. The United States uses these military blocs to control its partners and exclude other countries from participating freely, in order to create and maintain division and confrontation in the long term, so as to achieve their goals against other countries. Not only that, but the United States, through the military aggressive blocs it controls, also oppresses its allies to frantically carry out arms expansion and war preparations, increasing the burden of military spending on the people of all countries, creating international tensions, and preparing for a new war. Just as the US policy of reviving German militarism and establishing a Western European military alliance is a serious threat to the security of European peace-loving countries, its activities in organizing military aggressive blocs in many regions of Asia are directed against the People's Republic of China and other Asian people's democratic countries. The United States occupies our territory of Taiwan and is strengthening its military activities in the Taiwan area. It is holding a series of meetings on military and espionage activities in Southeast Asia to plan war preparations and intensify interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries. At the same time, it also regularly conducts various military exercises in the Southwest Pacific, carrying out war threats. US Secretary of State Dulles even openly clamored at the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Council that America's partners should support the US "policy of strength" not only in Europe but also in Asia. All these activities of the United States are increasing the danger of war in Asia.

It is precisely because of this that Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, who attended the Warsaw Conference as an observer, stated at the conference: "Peace and security in Asia are inseparable from peace and security in Europe, and the interests of the People's Republic of China are inseparable from the interests of the peace-loving countries in Europe." Vice Premier Peng Dehuai correctly pointed out that the decisions of the Warsaw Conference "are not only very necessary measures to ensure peace and security in Europe, but will also have a profound impact on peace and security in Asia." The Chinese people fully agree with the statement of Vice Premier Peng Dehuai, and we will give full support and cooperation to the decisions of the Warsaw Conference.

The Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp have consistently advocated resolving international disputes through consultation and striving to promote friendly cooperation between countries. In order to enhance mutual understanding and trust between countries, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued a declaration on February 9 this year, advocating the establishment of direct contacts between parliaments of various countries and welcoming them to take any steps to strengthen international peace. China's efforts to eliminate doubts between countries and enhance mutual trust, especially those demonstrated at the Asian-African Conference, have been universally recognized. Because the entire socialist camp resolutely implements a policy of peace, and because other peace-loving forces persist in their struggle, even in the face of the increasingly intensified activities of international aggressive forces in preparing for a new war, significant achievements have still been made in improving relations between countries. The resolutions unanimously adopted by the Asian-African Conference, attended by twenty-nine countries, opened up broad avenues for promoting international cooperation and are of great significance for maintaining peace. The agreement of the Soviet-Austrian talks and the resulting agreement on the Austrian State Treaty prove that it is entirely possible to resolve international issues through consultation. The rising call of the people of all countries for consultations among major powers has placed the issue of holding a summit conference on the agenda of international affairs. This situation shows that there are currently favorable factors to ease tensions; the possibility of resolving outstanding international issues through major power negotiations in accordance with the interests of peace, the freedom of the people of all countries, and national independence has not yet been fully utilized.

In particular, it should be pointed out that the Soviet government's proposal of May 11 on the issue of arms reduction, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of a new war is a great contribution to the cause of peace. In this proposal, the Soviet government pointed out that stopping the "Cold War," withdrawing the occupying forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France from Germany, abolishing military bases on the territory of other countries, resolving outstanding issues in the Far East in accordance with the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, and eliminating discrimination in international trade relations and expanding cultural exchanges will create the necessary conditions for the realization of a broad disarmament program. At the same time, in this proposal, the Soviet government put forward practical and feasible specific plans for arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons, as well as the establishment of necessary international supervision for this purpose. This plan has eliminated many of the obstacles that exist in the issue of arms reduction and the establishment of international supervision. The implementation of the Soviet proposal would save mankind from the scourge of a new war, relieve the burden of military spending on the vast number of people, and enable the people of all countries to enjoy a peaceful life. This is another proof of the Soviet Union's tireless efforts to ease international tensions and strive for peace.

The Eight-Nation Treaty has enabled the peace-loving countries of Europe to unite their forces in a fraternal alliance. This alliance is a powerful force for peace-loving countries to take joint action to counter planned aggression and ensure peace and security in Europe. At the same time, it is also a reliable pillar for the efforts of peace-loving people to strive for and maintain peace. The peace-loving people of all countries will certainly fully support the decisions of the Warsaw Conference and carry out a resolute struggle against the implementation of the Paris Agreements. As long as the people of all countries heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and strive hard, we will be able to stop the conspiracies of aggressive forces to launch a new war, thereby promoting the great cause of maintaining peace in Europe and the world.
