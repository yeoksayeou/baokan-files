The peace-loving people of the world welcome the historically significant achievements of the Warsaw Conference. At this conference, eight European countries, in order to ensure peace and security in Europe, signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, and adopted a resolution on the establishment of a Joint Command of the Armed Forces. The achievements of the Warsaw Conference strengthened the friendship and cooperation between the peace-loving countries of Europe and fully demonstrated the great, unbreakable unity and growing strength of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp. The resolute actions taken by European peace-loving countries to strengthen their defense forces are a major contribution to safeguarding peace in Europe and the world. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the success of the conference.

It is well known that the Western countries, despite repeated warnings from the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe, approved the Paris Agreements and are implementing them. The final communiqué of the Warsaw Conference pointed out that "the ratification of the Paris Agreements increases the danger of a new war and poses a threat to the national security of peace-loving countries." This is evident to everyone. According to the provisions of the Paris Agreements, Western countries are remilitarizing West Germany and dragging it into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and the new military bloc of the so-called "Western European Union," which are directed against the Soviet Union and the European people's democracies. This action by Western countries seriously hinders the unification of Germany and endangers peace in Europe and the world. In order to deal with this serious threat from Western countries, European peace-loving countries signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance at the Warsaw Conference. This treaty stipulates that if any state or group of states in Europe engages in armed attack against one or more of the contracting parties, each contracting party shall exercise the right of individual or collective self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. The treaty also provides for the establishment of a Joint Command of the Armed Forces to command the armed forces allocated to this command by the contracting parties. The contracting parties will also take the necessary coordinated measures to strengthen their defense capabilities in order to safeguard the peaceful labor of their people, guarantee the inviolability of their borders and territories, and ensure defense against possible aggression. The defensive nature of the Eight-Nation Treaty is obviously very clear. This treaty is not only a necessary step to ensure the security of the contracting states themselves, but also a powerful pillar for maintaining peace in Europe and the world.

Grotewohl, head of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, stated at the Warsaw Conference that the unification of Germany on the basis of the principles of peace and democracy is the main task of the German Democratic Republic and all the German people. He pointed out that the Eight-Nation Treaty is "a great help to the German people's efforts to unify Germany in a peaceful and democratic manner." Grotewohl's statement expressed the common demands and common understanding of the German people and the peace-loving people of the world. Ten years have passed since the end of the war. During these long years, despite the tireless efforts of the Soviet Union and European peace-loving countries, and despite the continuous struggle of the German Democratic Republic and the German people in all aspects, German unification has still not been achieved. The Western bloc, headed by the United States, has consistently insisted on dividing Germany, wanting to turn West Germany into their war front. Obviously, only when the forces of peace are stronger will it be possible to make the forces of war more sober. Therefore, the Eight-Nation Treaty will certainly be of great help to the German people in unifying their country on the basis of peaceful and democratic principles. Of course, completing the task of unifying Germany depends first and foremost on the efforts of the patriotic forces of the German people themselves.

The Warsaw Treaty is in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and is an effective tool for ensuring international peace and security. The treaty stipulates that the contracting parties guarantee in their international relations to refrain from the threat or use of force and to resolve international disputes by peaceful means. The treaty also stipulates that all other countries, regardless of their social and state systems, may join this treaty. In this spirit, the treaty reaffirms the contracting parties' hope to establish a European collective security system on the basis of the participation of all countries in Europe, in order to unite their efforts to safeguard peace in Europe; and stipulates that the Eight-Nation Treaty shall cease to be effective from the date of entry into force of the All-European Treaty. The Eight-Nation Treaty also stipulates that the contracting parties will, in agreement with other countries willing to cooperate, take effective measures for universal arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. All of this shows that the Warsaw Treaty is a peace treaty. It is an alliance for maintaining peace based on the principles of equality, mutual respect for national sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs, established by the contracting states for common purposes and interests.

Obviously, the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed by the European peace-loving countries, and the organization established in accordance with this treaty, are fundamentally different from the military alliance treaties and military aggression blocs between imperialist countries. The North Atlantic aggressive bloc, the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, and the Turko-Iraqi military agreement, all manipulated by the United States, are tools serving the war policies of the major imperialist countries, mainly the US aggressive bloc. The United States uses these military blocs to control its partners and exclude other countries from participating freely, in order to create and maintain division and confrontation in the long term, so as to achieve their goals against other countries. Not only that, but the United States, through the military aggressive blocs it controls, also oppresses its allies to frantically carry out arms expansion and war preparations, increasing the burden of military spending on the people of all countries, creating international tensions, and preparing for a new war. Just as the US policy of reviving German militarism and establishing a Western European military alliance is a serious threat to the security of European peace-loving countries, its activities in organizing military aggressive blocs in many regions of Asia are directed against the People's Republic of China and other Asian people's democratic countries. The United States occupies our territory of Taiwan and is strengthening its military activities in the Taiwan area. It is holding a series of meetings on military and espionage activities in Southeast Asia to plan war preparations and intensify interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries. At the same time, it also regularly conducts various military exercises in the Southwest Pacific, carrying out war threats. US Secretary of State Dulles even openly clamored at the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Council that America's partners should support the US "policy of strength" not only in Europe but also in Asia. All these activities of the United States are increasing the danger of war in Asia.

It is precisely because of this that Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, who attended the Warsaw Conference as an observer, stated at the conference: "Peace and security in Asia are inseparable from peace and security in Europe, and the interests of the People's Republic of China are inseparable from the interests of the peace-loving countries in Europe." Vice Premier Peng Dehuai correctly pointed out that the decisions of the Warsaw Conference "are not only very necessary measures to ensure peace and security in Europe, but will also have a profound impact on peace and security in Asia." The Chinese people fully agree with the statement of Vice Premier Peng Dehuai, and we will give full support and cooperation to the decisions of the Warsaw Conference.

The Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp have consistently advocated resolving international disputes through consultation and striving to promote friendly cooperation between countries. In order to enhance mutual understanding and trust between countries, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued a declaration on February 9 this year, advocating the establishment of direct contacts between parliaments of various countries and welcoming them to take any steps to strengthen international peace. China's efforts to eliminate doubts between countries and enhance mutual trust, especially those demonstrated at the Asian-African Conference, have been universally recognized. Because the entire socialist camp resolutely implements a policy of peace, and because other peace-loving forces persist in their struggle, even in the face of the increasingly intensified activities of international aggressive forces in preparing for a new war, significant achievements have still been made in improving relations between countries. The resolutions unanimously adopted by the Asian-African Conference, attended by twenty-nine countries, opened up broad avenues for promoting international cooperation and are of great significance for maintaining peace. The agreement of the Soviet-Austrian talks and the resulting agreement on the Austrian State Treaty prove that it is entirely possible to resolve international issues through consultation. The rising call of the people of all countries for consultations among major powers has placed the issue of holding a summit conference on the agenda of international affairs. This situation shows that there are currently favorable factors to ease tensions; the possibility of resolving outstanding international issues through major power negotiations in accordance with the interests of peace, the freedom of the people of all countries, and national independence has not yet been fully utilized.

In particular, it should be pointed out that the Soviet government's proposal of May 11 on the issue of arms reduction, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of a new war is a great contribution to the cause of peace. In this proposal, the Soviet government pointed out that stopping the "Cold War," withdrawing the occupying forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France from Germany, abolishing military bases on the territory of other countries, resolving outstanding issues in the Far East in accordance with the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, and eliminating discrimination in international trade relations and expanding cultural exchanges will create the necessary conditions for the realization of a broad disarmament program. At the same time, in this proposal, the Soviet government put forward practical and feasible specific plans for arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons, as well as the establishment of necessary international supervision for this purpose. This plan has eliminated many of the obstacles that exist in the issue of arms reduction and the establishment of international supervision. The implementation of the Soviet proposal would save mankind from the scourge of a new war, relieve the burden of military spending on the vast number of people, and enable the people of all countries to enjoy a peaceful life. This is another proof of the Soviet Union's tireless efforts to ease international tensions and strive for peace.

The Eight-Nation Treaty has enabled the peace-loving countries of Europe to unite their forces in a fraternal alliance. This alliance is a powerful force for peace-loving countries to take joint action to counter planned aggression and ensure peace and security in Europe. At the same time, it is also a reliable pillar for the efforts of peace-loving people to strive for and maintain peace. The peace-loving people of all countries will certainly fully support the decisions of the Warsaw Conference and carry out a resolute struggle against the implementation of the Paris Agreements. As long as the people of all countries heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and strive hard, we will be able to stop the conspiracies of aggressive forces to launch a new war, thereby promoting the great cause of maintaining peace in Europe and the world.

### 维护欧洲和世界和平的强大支柱

　　维护欧洲和世界和平的强大支柱
    全世界爱好和平人民欢迎华沙会议具有重大历史意义的成就。在这个会议上，八个欧洲国家为了保障欧洲和平和安全，签订了友好合作互助条约，并通过了关于建立武装部队联合司令部的决议。华沙会议的成就，加强了欧洲爱好和平国家的友谊和合作，充分表现了和平、民主和社会主义阵营各国伟大的、牢不可破的团结和日益增长的力量。欧洲爱好和平国家为加强自己的防御力量而采取的坚决行动，是对保障欧洲和世界和平的重大贡献。中国人民热烈祝贺会议的成功。
    人所共知，西方国家不顾苏联和欧洲其他爱好和平国家的多次警告，批准了巴黎协定，并正在把这个协定付诸实施。华沙会议最后公报指出：“巴黎协定的批准使得新战争的危险增加，并造成了对爱好和平的国家的国家安全的威胁”。这是人人都能够看到的。根据巴黎协定的规定，西方国家正在使西德重新军国主义化，并把它拉入西方国家反对苏联和欧洲人民民主国家的北大西洋侵略集团和所谓“西欧联盟”的新军事集团。西方国家的这种行动严重地阻挠着德国的统一，危害着欧洲和世界的和平。为了对付来自西方国家的这种严重威胁，欧洲爱好和平的国家才在华沙会议上签订友好合作互助条约。这个条约规定如果在欧洲发生了任何国家和国家集团对一个或几个缔约国的武装进攻，每一缔约国应根据联合国宪章第五十一条行使单独或集体自卫的权利。条约并规定建立武装部队联合司令部来统率缔约国拨给这个司令部的武装部队。缔约国各方并将采取加强它们的防御能力的必要配合措施，以便保障它们的人民的和平劳动，保证它们的疆界和领土的不可侵犯性并确保对可能的侵略的防御。八国条约的防御性质显然是十分明白的。这个条约不但是保障缔约国家自身安全的必要步骤，同时也是维护欧洲和世界和平的强大支柱。
    德意志民主共和国代表团团长格罗提渥在华沙会议上声明，根据和平和民主的原则统一德国，是德意志民主共和国和全体德国人民的主要任务。他指出八国条约是“对德国人民争取以和平和民主方式统一德国的努力的巨大帮助”。格罗提渥团长的声明，表达了德国人民和世界爱好和平人民的共同要求和共同认识。战争结束已经十年。在这漫长的年月中，尽管苏联和欧洲爱好和平国家作了不知疲倦的努力，尽管德意志民主共和国和德国人民从各方面作了不间断的斗争，但是德国统一还是不能实现。以美国为首的西方集团始终坚持分裂德国，想把西德变成他们的战争前线。显然，只有和平力量更加强大，才有可能使战争势力的头脑清醒一些。因此，八国条约对于德国人民根据和平民主的原则来统一自己的国家，肯定是会有巨大帮助的。当然，完成统一德国的任务，首先取决于德国人民本身爱国力量的努力。
    华沙条约符合于联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，是保证国际和平和安全的有效工具。这个条约规定缔约国保证在国际关系中，不以武力相威胁或使用武力，并以和平方法解决国际争端。条约还规定所有其他国家，不问它们的社会和国家制度如何，都可以加入这一条约。根据这一精神，条约重申缔约国希望在欧洲所有国家参加的基础上建立欧洲集体安全体系，以联合它们的努力来保障欧洲和平；并规定：八国条约将自全欧条约生效之日起失效。八国条约并规定：缔约国将和其他愿意合作的国家取得协议的办法，来采取普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的有效措施。所有这一切显示，华沙条约是一个和平条约。它是缔约国家为了共同的目的和利益，建立在平等、互相尊重国家主权和不干涉内政的原则的基础上的维护和平的联盟。
    显然，欧洲爱好和平国家所签订的友好合作互助条约，以及根据这个条约而成立的组织，同帝国主义国家之间的军事同盟条约和军事侵略集团有着根本性质的不同。由美国所操纵的北大西洋侵略集团、东南亚侵略集团以及土巴、土伊军事协定，都是为大帝国主义国家，主要是美国侵略集团的战争政策效劳的工具。美国利用这些军事集团来控制它的伙伴，并排除其他国家自由参加，以便制造并长期保持分裂和对立，来实现它们反对其他国家的目的。不止如此，美国还通过它所控制的军事侵略集团压迫它的盟国疯狂地进行扩军备战，加重了各国人民的军费负担，造成国际紧张局势，准备新战争。正如美国复活德国军国主义、建立西欧军事联盟的政策是对欧洲爱好和平国家的安全的严重威胁一样，它在亚洲许多地区组织军事侵略集团的活动是针对着中华人民共和国和其他亚洲人民民主国家。美国侵占我国领土台湾，正在加强对台湾地区的军事活动。它正在东南亚举行一连串的军事和特务活动的会议，来策划战争准备和加紧干涉亚洲国家内政。同时它还经常在西南太平洋举行各种军事演习，进行战争威胁。美国国务卿杜勒斯在最近举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议上甚至公然叫嚣要美国的伙伴们不但要在欧洲而且要在亚洲支持美国的“实力政策”。所有美国的这一切活动使亚洲的战争危险日益增长。
    正是因为这样，所以中华人民共和国出席华沙会议观察员、国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀在会议上表示：“亚洲的和平和安全同欧洲的和平和安全是分不开的，中华人民共和国的利益同欧洲爱好和平的国家的利益是分不开的。”彭德怀副总理正确地指出，华沙会议的决定“不仅是保障欧洲和平和安全非常必要的措施，同时对于亚洲的和平和安全也将发生深刻的影响。”中国人民完全赞成彭德怀副总理的声明，对于华沙会议的决定我们必将给予完全的支持和合作。
    苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家，一贯主张以协商方式解决国际争端，努力促进各国间的友好合作。为了增进各国间的相互了解和信任，苏联最高苏维埃在今年二月九日发表的宣言，主张各国议会间建立直接的接触，欢迎它们为加强国际和平采取任何步骤。中国为消除各国间的疑虑，增进相互的信任所作的努力，特别是在亚非会议上所表现的，已经是人所共见。由于整个社会主义阵营坚决执行和平政策，由于其他爱好和平力量坚持奋斗，因此，即使在国际侵略势力日益加紧其准备新战争的活动的情况下，在改善各国之间的关系方面依然取得了显著的成就。由二十九个国家参加的亚非会议一致通过的决议，为促进国际合作开辟了广泛的途径，对于维护和平有着重大的意义。苏奥会谈的协议以及由此而达成的对奥和约的协议，证明以协商方式解决国际问题是完全可能的。各国人民要求大国协商的呼声的高涨，已使举行大国会议的问题提到了国际事务的日程上来了。这种情形说明，目前存在着有利的因素来缓和紧张局势；通过大国谈判，按照和平、各国人民的自由和民族独立的利益来解决尚未解决的国际问题的可能性，还远没有被利用。
    特别应当指出，苏联政府于五月十一日提出的关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的建议，是对和平事业的一个巨大贡献。在这个建议中苏联政府指出：停止“冷战”，撤退苏、美、英、法四国在德国的占领军，取消在他国领土上的军事基地，根据主权和领土完整的原则解决远东的悬而未决的问题，以及消除国际贸易关系中的歧视现象和扩大文化交流，将为实现广泛的裁军方案创造必要的条件。同时，在这个建议中，苏联政府对于裁减军备和禁止原子武器以及为此而建立必要的国际监督，提出了切实可行的具体方案。这个方案在很多方面消除了在裁减军备和建立国际监督问题上所存在着的障碍。实现苏联的建议，就将使人类免遭新战争的浩劫，解除广大人民的军费负担，使各国人民得到安宁的生活。这是苏联不倦地为缓和国际紧张局势、争取和平而努力的又一证明。
    八国条约已使欧洲爱好和平的国家把自己的力量团结在兄弟的联盟中。这个联盟是爱好和平的国家采取联合行动以回击策划中的侵略，并保障欧洲的和平和安全的强大力量。同时，它也是爱好和平人民争取和维护和平的努力的可靠支柱。各国爱好和平的人民必将全力支持华沙会议的决定，并进行坚决的斗争来反对巴黎协定的实施。只要各国人民提高警惕、加强团结、努力斗争，我们就有可能制止侵略势力发动新战争的阴谋，从而推进维护欧洲和世界和平的伟大事业。
