　　"Self-Construction with Public Assistance" Solves Workers' Housing Problem
　　The trade union of the Chongqing 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory adopted the method of "self-construction with public assistance" to help workers lacking housing to build more than 80 rooms. Now, some workers have already moved into their newly built homes. Over the past two years, the factory has been continuously expanding, and the number of employees has also increased. In order to solve the housing problem for employees, the government allocated more than 500 rooms, and the factory also built more than 200 rooms, but it still felt that housing was not enough. Therefore, the trade union organization of this factory adopted the method of "self-construction with public assistance" to help workers lacking housing to build houses. In October 1954, the factory allocated a piece of land, completed the construction design for the houses, and allocated 5,000 yuan from the enterprise bonus to repair the public roads in the residential area and install street lights. The trade union mobilized workers to help level the foundation and transport wood in their spare time, and lent money to the workers who built the houses. These houses were built economically and practically. The cost of each tile-roofed house was 150 yuan, and each thatched house was only 100 yuan.

　　“自建公助”解决工人住宅问题
    重庆六一零纺织染厂工会采用“自建公助”的办法，帮助缺少房屋的工人修建了八十多间房屋，现在有一部分工人已经搬进了自己新建的住宅。两年来工厂不断扩建，职工人数也随着增加，为了解决职工住房问题，政府拨给了五百多间房子，工厂也修盖了两百多间，但还是感到住房不够用。于是这个工厂的工会组织就采用了“自建公助”的办法，帮助缺少房屋的工人修建住宅。一九五四年十月，工厂划出一块地皮，做好修建住宅的施工设计，并从企业奖金中拨出五千元修好了住宅区的公共道路，安装了路灯。工会动员工人在业余时间帮助平地基，搬运木材，并借钱给修建房屋的工人。这批住宅修得经济、适用，每间瓦房的造价是一百五十元，每间草房只有一百元。
