　　Promote Pigskin Leather Production, Conserve Cowhide
　　Lin Zaiwu
    Since 1953, the Shanghai Local State-Operated Yimin Leather Factory has been using pigskin to manufacture industrial products. So far, it has manufactured 15 different types and specifications of leather cores, leather rings, shuttle box leather boards, heald frame leather belts, and other textile industrial supplies. These products have been tested by state-owned Shanghai No. 6, No. 9, and No. 12 cotton textile factories and have proven to be very effective.

    The Zhejiang Provincial State-Operated Wenzhou Leather Factory also began using pigskin to manufacture leather shoes and other daily-use leather goods more than a year ago. The pigskin tanning technology has been continuously improved. After long-term testing by users, the manufactured leather shoes have proven to not swell when exposed to water, not crack, not wrinkle, and are also very wear-resistant. The sales of pigskin shoes have been increasing day by day. So far, this factory has used 150,000 pigskins, and its experience has been promoted in eleven private leather factories in Wenzhou. Civilian leather goods in the Wenzhou area are now basically made of pigskin.

    Recently, the Local State-Operated Chongqing Leather Factory has also successfully trial-produced more than 90 products using pigskin, including leather rings, leather shoes, leather suitcases, basketballs, volleyballs, and other products. After chemical and physical testing and trial use, these products have proven to have excellent performance.

    The facts from these factories prove that using pigskin for leather production is an effective way to overcome the current shortage of raw material supply in the leather industry and reasonably meet social needs.

    In recent years, cowhide has been the main raw material for the leather industry, with an annual consumption of more than one million hides. Although the supply of cowhide to the leather industry has increased over the years, it is insufficient to rely solely on cowhide as the main raw material, given the gradual expansion of the scope of leather use and the increasing social demand. In 1954, the supply of cowhide to the leather industry only reached 37.8 percent of the production capacity of the leather industry's main equipment. Therefore, a contradictory situation has formed where the equipment capacity cannot be utilized and social needs cannot be reasonably met.

    The net reproductive rate of cattle is also relatively slow. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, with the number of cattle raised in 1952 as 100, the number in 1953 was 108.96, and in 1954 it was 114.99. From this, it can be seen that the source of cowhide is limited. Although the skins of various animals such as mules, horses, sheep, sharks, wild cattle, wild horses, wild sheep, and deer can also be used for leather production, they are also limited by slow reproduction or difficult hunting, and cannot be supplied as raw materials for leather production in large quantities. Only pigskin has the most adequate conditions for full utilization.

    Pigs have a high reproduction and growth rate, a short feeding period, and their numbers increase every year. It is estimated that if only one-tenth of the skins of pigs slaughtered each year are used for leather production, it would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the national leather industry.

    Pigskin leather products have many advantages. For example, leather cores and leather rings used in the textile industry made of pigskin are one and a half times more durable than those made of cowhide, and the price is 35 percent lower than that of cowhide. Leather shoes made of pigskin have been tested for a long time and have proven to have a higher breaking strength than cowhide.

    In order to promote pigskin leather production, the workers of leather factories are required to further improve their technology, improve quality, and strive to learn from the experience of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries in using pigskin for leather production, so as to manufacture more high-quality and inexpensive pigskin leather products to meet the needs of society and the people. State-owned commercial departments should also assist in coordinating this work. In promoting this work, it is also necessary to respect the customs and habits of ethnic minority areas and not forcibly promote pigskin leather production in those areas.

### 推广猪皮制革，节约牛皮

　　推广猪皮制革，节约牛皮
　　林在午
    上海市地方国营益民皮革厂从一九五三年起就开始用猪皮制造工业用品，到现在共制造了十五种不同形式和规格的皮仁、皮圈、梭箱皮板、吊综皮带等纺织工业用品。这些用品经国营上海第六、第九、第十二等棉纺织厂试用，证明效果很好。
    浙江省地方国营温州制革厂也在一年多以前利用猪皮制造皮鞋和其它日用皮件。猪皮制革的技术不断提高，制造的皮鞋经过用户长期试验以后，证明见水不胀，又不断裂、不起皱纹，还很耐磨。猪皮鞋销路日益扩大，到现在，这个厂已经使用了十五万张猪皮，它的经验已在温州市十一家私营制革厂推广。温州一带的民用皮革，基本上都已用猪皮制造。
    最近，地方国营重庆皮革厂也用猪皮试制成功了皮圈、皮鞋、皮箱、篮球、排球等九十多种产品。经过化学、物理检验和试用证明，这些产品性能都很优良。
    这些工厂的事实证明，利用猪皮制革是克服当前制革工业原料供应不足，合理满足社会需要的有效办法。
    几年来，牛皮一直是制革工业的主要原料，每年约耗用牛皮一百多万张。供应制革工业的牛皮虽然历年来有所增加，但是，在皮革的使用范围逐步扩大和社会需要量不断增加的情况下，再单靠牛皮为主要原料，就不够了。一九五四年，供应制革工业的牛皮，仅达制革工业主要设备生产能力的百分之三十七点八，因此就形成了一方面设备能力不能发挥，另一方面又不能合理满足社会需要的矛盾状态。
    牛的净增殖率也是比较慢的。据农业部统计，以一九五二年牛的饲养数为一百，一九五三年为一百零八点九六，一九五四年为一百十四点九九。由此看来，牛皮的来源是有一定限度的，骡、马、羊、鲨鱼、野牛、野马、野羊和鹿等各种动物的皮，虽然也可用来制革，但是它们同样也受到繁殖慢或猎捕困难的限制，不能大量供应制革的原料。只有猪皮最具有充分利用的条件。
    猪的生殖率和生长率高，饲养期短，数量年年有增加。据估计，在每年屠宰的猪中，只要用十分之一的皮来制革，就能满足全国制革工业的要求。
    猪革制品有很多优点。例如，用猪皮制成的皮仁、皮圈等纺织工业用革，比牛皮做的要耐用一倍半，价格比牛革低百分之三十五。用猪皮制成的皮鞋，经过长时间的考验，证明它的破裂强度比牛革的还高。
    为了推广猪皮制革，要求制革厂的职工们进一步提高技术，提高质量，努力学习苏联和兄弟国家用猪皮制革的经验，制造出更多的物美价廉的猪革制品来满足社会和人民的需要，国营商业部门也应协助配合这项工作。在推广这一工作中，还要尊重少数民族地区的风俗习惯，不要在那些地区硬行推广猪皮制革。
