　　Jiangsu Province has basically completed the restoration project of the main dikes along the Yangtze River and the dikes along the river ports, islands, and embankments. This dike restoration project involved a total of 56 million cubic meters of earthwork, exceeding the total amount of earthwork done for river and port dike repairs in the five years since liberation by one time. All dike sections are generally higher and thicker than before. Most of the Yangtze River dikes in Nanjing, Jiangning, Dantu, Jiangpu and other places are one meter higher than the highest flood level of last year, and more than thirty new dikes have been built along the river. After the completion of the entire project, the safety of millions of mu of farmland in the high-yield grain areas along the river, the cities and industrial and mining enterprises along the river, transportation enterprises, and the lives and property of the broad masses of people will be more reliably guaranteed. Now that the flood season of the Yangtze River is approaching, various places along the river in Jiangsu Province have begun to carry out acceptance and inspection work of the embankments. The Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Department has also sent four inspection teams to Yangzhou, Nantong, Zhenjiang, Suzhou and other special districts for inspection and guidance.

　  江苏江堤普遍加高培厚
    江苏省长江干堤和沿江的港、洲、圩堤修复工程已基本完工。这次复堤工程共做土方五千六百万公方，超过解放五年来江、港堤检修工程的土方总数一倍。各个堤段一般都比原来加高培厚，南京、江宁、丹徒、江浦等地大部分江堤比去年最高洪水位高出一公尺，沿江并筑起新堤三十余段。全部工程完工后，沿江粮食高产量地区的千百万亩农田、沿江城市和工矿、交通运输企业以及广大人民生命财产的安全就有了更可靠的保障。现在，长江汛期即将到来，江苏省沿江各地已开始进行堤防的验收和检查工作，江苏省水利厅并派出四个检查组分赴扬州、南通、镇江、苏州等专区进行检查和指导。
