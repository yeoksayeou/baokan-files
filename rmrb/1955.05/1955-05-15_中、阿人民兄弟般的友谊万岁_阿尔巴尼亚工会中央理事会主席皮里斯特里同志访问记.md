　　Long Live the Brotherly Friendship Between the Chinese and Albanian People
　　——A Record of Comrade Piro Pirozhkov's Visit, Chairman of the Central Council of Albanian Trade Unions
　　By Our Staff Reporter Feng Zhidan
　　It was already 9:15 PM. The Albanian Trade Union Delegation, invited to our country to attend the May Day celebrations, was scheduled to take the train to the Guanting Reservoir for a visit in an hour and a half. Comrade Piro Pirozhkov, the head of the delegation and Chairman of the Central Council of Albanian Trade Unions, spared some time to meet with me and a reporter from the Workers' Daily.

　　Before us was a distinguished Albanian trade union activist, his warm gaze filled with the love brought from our distant brothers, the Albanian people. Comrade Pirozhkov began to speak to us warmly in his Albanian language. He said, "If calculated by distance, our two countries are far apart; but how close our two peoples are in heart and mind!" Before Comrade Pirozhkov's words were translated into Chinese, we seemed to have already felt that Comrade Pirozhkov was kindly narrating the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples to us.

　　Comrade Pirozhkov told us how excited he was when he received the invitation from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. He said, "I knew that I was going to spend May Day with the great Chinese people, which is not only my personal joy but also the joy of all trade union members and all workers in Albania, who are proud to have friends like the Chinese people."

　　"This is the first time that an Albanian trade union delegation has visited China," Comrade Pirozhkov continued, "I cherish this visit very much. I am convinced that through this visit, we can further strengthen the ties between Albania and China and develop the friendship between the Albanian and Chinese peoples."

　　Comrade Pirozhkov gesticulated from time to time, eager for us to directly understand all of his language. He gestured with his hands to indicate size, saying, "The socialist camp is very large, our family is very large. Although Albania is small in size, we are a member of this glorious big family." He said, "What connects us is a new bond, a connection that has never existed in history. If it were not for the liberation of the Albanian and Chinese peoples and the establishment of our new types of countries, how could we imagine that there could be such a brotherly friendship between us as there is today?"

　　Comrade Pirozhkov especially mentioned the hospitality of the Chinese people. He praised it as an excellent tradition of the Chinese people. He said, "Since the first day we arrived in China, we have felt as much at home as in our own country." He also mentioned the batch of gifts given to Albania by the Chinese people during the tenth anniversary of Albania's liberation last year, and expressed gratitude to the Chinese people on behalf of the Albanian workers.

　　Comrade Pirozhkov praised the great achievements of the new China. I felt that he was praising the achievements of his brother China with a sense of pride. He compared the May Day parade in the capital to a "garden blooming with flowers."

　　Comrade Pirozhkov not only brought Tirana's deep greetings to Beijing, but also brought the sympathy and support of the people of his country for the just cause of the Chinese people in liberating Taiwan. He said, "Peace is our common cause. We jointly demand peaceful construction, but the war-mongers in Washington have plotted the Paris Accords in Europe and armed occupied China's territory Taiwan in the Far East. Those who play with fire will eventually get burned, this is the truth. The cause of the Chinese people in liberating Taiwan and other coastal islands is just and legitimate. Peace-loving people all over the world sympathize with and support this struggle of the Chinese people. The Albanian people wholeheartedly support this sacred struggle of the Chinese people."

　　"The Albanian people believe that world affairs, especially Asian affairs, cannot be carried out without regard to the will of the 600 million Chinese people," Comrade Pirozhkov said decisively.

　　Originally, we wanted to ask Comrade Pirozhkov to introduce the heroic deeds of the Albanian working people in the socialist construction of their motherland, because the Chinese people deeply admire the extraordinary achievements of the Albanian brothers in construction.

　　However, in the earnest conversation, time passed quickly, the train was about to leave, and we had to reluctantly end this unforgettable visit.

　　中、阿人民兄弟般的友谊万岁
　　——阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会主席皮里斯特里同志访问记
　　本报记者　冯之丹
    已经是晚上九时一刻了。应邀前来我国参加五一节观礼的阿尔巴尼亚工会代表团预定在一个半钟点以后就要搭火车赶往官厅水库去参观。代表团团长、阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会主席皮里斯特里同志抽空接见了我和一位工人日报的记者。
    在我们面前的，是一位卓越的阿尔巴尼亚工会活动家，他的热情的目光蕴藏着从我们的远方兄弟、阿尔巴尼亚人民那里带来的友爱。皮里斯特里同志开始热情奔放地用他的阿尔巴尼亚语言同我们交谈。他说：“假如从距离上来计算，我们这两个国家相隔很远；但是在我们两国人民的心和心之间又是多么地相近！”在皮里斯特里同志的话被译成中文以前，我们好像已经感觉到了皮里斯特里同志是在向我们亲切地叙述着中阿两国人民的兄弟般的友谊。
    皮里斯特里同志告诉我们说，当他接到中华全国总工会的请柬时，他的心情是如何的兴奋。他说：“我知道，我将要和伟大的中国人民一道度过五一节，这不仅是我个人的欢欣，也是阿尔巴尼亚所有工会会员和全体劳动者的欢欣，他们以得到像中国人民这样的朋友而自豪。”
      “阿尔巴尼亚工会代表团到中国访问，这还是第一次，”皮里斯特里同志继续说，“我十分珍视这次访问。我深信，通过这次访问，可以进一步加强阿、中两国的联系，发展阿、中两国人民之间的友谊。”
      皮里斯特里同志不时地做着手势，极想我们能够直接地了解他的全部语言。他用手比划着大小说：“社会主义阵营很大，我们的家庭很大。阿尔巴尼亚虽然幅员很小，但是我们是这个光荣的大家庭的一员。”他说：“把我们联系起来的是一种新的纽带，这种联系是历史上从来没有过的。要不是阿、中两国人民的解放，并建立了自己新型的国家，我们怎么能够想像，在我们之间会有可能存在像今天这般的兄弟友谊呢？”
    皮里斯特里同志特别提到中国人民的好客。他称赞这是中国人民的优秀的传统。他说：“自从我们到达中国的第一天起，我们就感到一切都像在自己家里那样的亲切。”他还提到去年阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年纪念时中国人民赠送给阿尔巴尼亚的一批礼物，并代表阿尔巴尼亚的工人向中国人民表示感谢。
    皮里斯特里同志赞扬新中国的巨大成就。我感到他真是怀着一种自豪的心情在称赞着他的兄弟中国的成就。他把首都五一节的游行喻为“盛开着鲜花的花园”。
    皮里斯特里同志不仅带来了地拉那对北京的深挚的问候，而且带来了他祖国的人民对中国人民解放台湾的正义事业的同情和支持。他说：“和平是我们共同的事业。我们共同要求和平建设，但是华盛顿的战争挑拨者在欧洲策划了巴黎协定，在远东武装占领了中国的领土台湾。放火者终将自焚，这是真理。中国人民解放台湾及沿海其他岛屿的事业是正义的、合法的。全世界爱好和平的人民同情和支持中国人民的这一斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心地支持中国人民的这一神圣斗争。”
      “阿尔巴尼亚人民认为，世界事务，特别是亚洲事务，不顾六亿中国人民的意志，是行不通的。”皮里斯特里同志斩钉截铁地说。
    本来，我们正想请皮里斯特里同志介绍一下阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民在他们祖国的社会主义建设事业中的英勇事迹，因为中国人民深深地钦佩着阿尔巴尼亚兄弟在建设中的非凡的成就。
    但是，在恳切的交谈中，时间很快地就过去了，火车快要开了，我们只得依依不舍地结束了这次令人难忘的访问。
