Comrade Chairman! Comrade Representatives!
    The unchanging principle of Soviet foreign policy is the Leninist principle of coexistence of different social systems. The Soviet government adheres to this principle so that mankind can be freed from the horrors and disasters of war and so that the people of the world can have peace. The Soviet Union actively struggles to consolidate peace and ease international tensions, and welcomes any steps taken by other national governments in this regard.
    Therefore, the Soviet government believes that this conference to discuss issues related to ensuring peace and security in Europe is of particular significance.
    At the Moscow conference of European countries at the end of last year, the governments of the countries now meeting here reached an agreement that once the Paris Accords were ratified, it would be necessary to study the situation again.
    Now there is such a necessity. The ratification of the Paris Accords has become a fact. This has seriously changed the entire international situation and brought new problems to peace-loving countries.
    In the speeches of the participants of the Moscow Conference and in the declaration they passed, the Paris Accords were deeply analyzed, and the dangers these agreements brought to the cause of European peace were pointed out. Events that have occurred since then have proved the correctness of this analysis.
    We must consider the fact that the Paris Accords have been ratified and are being implemented.
    Due to the ratification of the Paris Accords, West German militarists and revanchists have the opportunity to openly establish a standing army and supply this army with all types of modern weapons, including atomic, chemical, and bacteriological weapons. West Germany is becoming a base for the deployment of large numbers of aggressive troops. Airfields, firing ranges, barracks, and warehouses are being built extensively there. West German militarists are formulating measures for the use of atomic weapons. Large quantities of American weapons are being prepared for shipment to West Germany, and the militarization of West German industry is being accelerated.
    The Paris Accords are thus placing the tools for new aggression and new oppression in the hands of yesterday's aggressors and occupiers. German militarism, which launched two world wars in the span of a generation, has reappeared on the European and international stage, threatening international peace and security.
    Ten years have passed since the end of the Second World War, and West Germany, with the help of the United States, Britain, and France, is becoming the main hotbed of war threats in Europe. It is becoming a member of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc and also a member of the Western European military alliance directed against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies.
    It should be mentioned that Britain and France have formed a military group with the militarists and revanchists of West Germany, violating their obligations under the treaties concluded with the Soviet Union during the Second World War against German militarist aggression. Therefore, Britain and France have in fact abolished these important treaties. Because of this situation, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ordered the abolition of these treaties on May 7.
    In the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council held in the second half of December last year, after the Moscow Conference had already been held, a resolution on preparing for atomic warfare was passed. This is also directly related to the Paris Accords and once again proves the threat these agreements pose to the cause of European peace.
    These aggressive forces are not only stepping up their activities in Europe. It is well known that great pressure is currently being exerted on some Near East and Middle East countries to force them to join the military group now being established as a subsidiary of the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance. Pressure is now being exerted on Syria, Egypt, and other Arab countries, as well as on Afghanistan, which borders the Soviet Union. There are now attempts to drag Iran into the aggressive group, although Iran has guaranteed not to participate in any political alliance or agreement against the Soviet Union under the Soviet-Iranian treaty of October 1, 1927, on guaranteeing neutrality.
    While establishing military alliances, the United States is also taking steps to expand its network of military bases, especially near the borders of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. The purpose is to use these bases to launch air attacks against our country and other peace-loving countries, and this is already an open secret.
    Provocative actions against the People's Republic of China continue in the Far East, in the Taiwan area. It is very clear that if the Chiang Kai-shek elements hiding in Taiwan did not have the support of a powerful protector—the United States—they would never dare to carry out their piratical activities; the United States has recruited the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who were driven out of China to serve it.
    Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the coastal islands have become military bases controlled by the United States and used to launch unwarranted attacks against the People's Republic of China and to engage in piracy against merchant ships sailing on the high seas.
    American officials call this policy "defending against Communist aggression," although the whole world knows that it is the United States itself that has seized Taiwan, which has been Chinese territory since ancient times, and that American army and navy generals are attempting to use atomic weapons to launch a major war.
    A military group called the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has been established in Southeast Asia. This is an alliance of Western colonial countries and some Asian countries dependent on them. Its purpose is to maintain and consolidate the colonial system, suppress national liberation movements, and interfere in the affairs of the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries.
    Therefore, it is not surprising that some Southeast Asian countries that respect freedom and independence, such as India, Burma, and Indonesia, have resolutely refused to participate in this aggressive and reactionary group of colonialists.
    It can be seen from the above that while West German militarism is being rebuilt, the activities of aggressive forces around the world have intensified. The West German "Bundeswehr" plays a special role as a shock force in this.
    The Soviet Union has consistently striven to ease international tensions and to maintain and strengthen peace. In this policy, the Soviet government counts on the support and cooperation of peace-loving countries attending this conference. The Soviet government also believes that its policy is supported by the peace-loving forces of other countries. Our confidence is based on the fact that the vital interests of the people of all countries require the maintenance of peace and the easing of international tensions.
    The struggle of the people of Western European countries against the Paris Accords has shown how strong the forces supporting peace are in those countries where some people are trying to subordinate domestic development and foreign policy to the preparation of new wars. The opposition of the progressive forces and the masses of the people in Western European countries has long hindered the implementation of plans to restore militarism in West Germany. The masses of the people are fully aware of the danger of the policy of reviving German militarism and preparing for new wars in Europe.
    The Soviet Union was and remains a firm and consistent opponent of the policy of remilitarizing West Germany. In the struggle against the ratification of the Paris Accords, we believed, as we do now, that the remilitarization of West Germany and its participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are the main obstacles to restoring Germany's national unity along peaceful and democratic lines. At the same time, we have supported and continue to support the restoration of Germany as a unified, free, peaceful, and democratic country.
    The Soviet Union's policy on the German question will continue to be based on these basic principles in the future.
    Therefore, it is necessary to take all measures to prevent the revival of German militarism and to carry out a broad and vigorous struggle against the implementation of the Paris Accords. Under this new situation, efforts must also be made for the national unity of Germany. To accomplish these tasks, the patriotic forces of the German people themselves, who are working to prevent the remilitarization of West Germany, should first play a decisive role.
    The harmonious coexistence of East and West Germany and the easing of tensions between them can make a significant contribution to the unification of Germany and the maintenance of European peace. There is no doubt that the concerted action of the two parts of Germany in establishing a unified, free, and democratic Germany is not only necessary, but also entirely possible, because it is in the interests of the entire German people.
    Of course, we cannot ignore the fact that the ratification of the Paris Accords has created a new, and overall unfavorable, situation for the German people in resolving the German question.
    As everyone knows, the Soviet government has repeatedly emphasized in its previous statements the importance of resolving the issue of German national unity through negotiations among the four major powers with the participation of representatives from both parts of Germany.
    If the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are indeed aiming at German unity and do not insist on the remilitarization of West Germany and its accession to their aggressive group—which can only deepen the division of Germany—then the negotiations proposed by the Soviet Union will undoubtedly produce positive results.
    However, the governments of the three Western powers have taken a different path. By ratifying the Paris Accords, they have shown that they are unwilling to consider the national interests of the German people and the interests of European peace and security.
    Therefore, the Soviet government will continue to do its best to promote the restoration of Germany's unity; and to promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany on an acceptable basis.
    The Soviet Union has been supporting, and will continue to support, those countries and forces that are concerned with easing international tensions and maintaining and strengthening universal peace and security.
    The Soviet government's attitude on the Austrian issue is consistent with this policy. It cannot be denied that the complete restoration of a neutral Austria's political and economic independence is a considerable contribution to the consolidation of European peace. The fact that social forces have emerged in Austria that are determined to follow this path proves the great possibility of developing cooperation between countries—regardless of their social systems.
    It would be wrong to think that only the Austrian government would hold this attitude. There are many countries in Europe and Asia that are unwilling to participate in military aggressive blocs. The peaceful aspirations of these countries will always receive full understanding and support from the Soviet Union.
    With the consent of the government of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government recently took steps to ease tensions in the Taiwan area and, to that end, held negotiations with the British and Indian governments.
    The Soviet government proposed the following suggestion: the countries that are particularly concerned about adjusting the situation that has emerged in the Taiwan and other Chinese islands should hold a corresponding conference to study this issue. In addition to the People's Republic of China and the United States, the conference should also include Britain, the Soviet Union, France, India, Burma, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ceylon. Due to the opposition of the United States, the conference did not take place. The United States insisted that the Chiang Kai-shek group should participate in the conference, although this group cannot represent anyone except itself.
    The Soviet government fully supports the position of the People's Republic of China on the Taiwan issue and the measures taken by the people's China to consolidate peace in that region.
    In view of the deterioration of the situation in the Near East and the Middle East, the Soviet government emphasized in its recent statement on security in that region that it cannot remain indifferent to the situation that is arising there. The Soviet government has declared that if the policy of pressure and threats against the countries of the Near East and the Middle East continues, the issue must be considered by the United Nations.
    The Soviet government firmly believes that if the countries that bear the primary responsibility for maintaining peace are sincere, it is possible to resolve some major international issues that are currently hindering the easing of international tensions.
    The leaders of the Soviet government have stated more than once that they advocate the establishment of normal international relations, advocate meetings, advocate expanding trade and exchanging cultural delegations as much as possible, in a word, advocate everything that can ease tensions. However, in this regard, not everything depends on us. Even a simple issue such as the exchange of student delegations has not been resolved positively. We suggested to the United States that we exchange student delegations, but they told us in reply that fingerprints were required. In order to ease tensions in international relations and actively resolve this or that specific issue, satisfactory conditions must be provided on the basis of trust and mutual understanding.
    Judging from newspaper reports, recently, the United States, Britain, and France have said and written a great deal about the need to hold a summit meeting of the four major powers. This is not accidental. The idea of holding such a meeting has taken root in the hearts of the broad masses of people, who place great hopes on the meeting, believing that it will help to improve international relations. This sentiment cannot be ignored.
    The Soviet government takes a positive attitude towards the proposal to hold a meeting of the major powers. Of course, it would be appropriate to hold such a meeting if it could truly promote the easing of international tensions and improve international relations.
    Yesterday, May 10, the Soviet government received a note from the United States government, as well as from the governments of France and Britain. The note suggested convening a summit meeting of the heads of government of the four powers with the participation of foreign ministers. The Soviet government will carefully study this note.
    The Soviet government, which has consistently worked to strengthen peace and ease international tensions, is continuing to take measures to reach agreements on banning atomic weapons, reducing armaments and armed forces, and eliminating the threat of new wars.
    Today, newspapers published a new proposal by the Soviet government on this issue.
    The new proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, which will require consideration by the United Nations General Assembly, are of great significance and a major contribution to the cause of peace. They will lead to the easing of international tensions and create conditions for building the necessary trust and mutual understanding among countries.
    The Soviet declaration states that the people of all countries, who recently experienced the Second World War, which caused massive losses in manpower and material resources, are expressing their firm will to demand peace more strongly than ever before. This deep desire for peace among the people of all countries has yielded some results, but nevertheless, the situation in some parts of the world has not only not improved, but on the contrary, has become increasingly complicated, and mutual distrust between countries has been increasing.
    The declaration states: "The lack of necessary trust in relations between countries is the main reason why the unresolved issues in Europe and Asia have not been resolved. This is especially true of relations between the major countries that bear the primary responsibility for maintaining universal peace and security."
    Distrust in relations between the major powers has created a situation in which the threat of another war has formed again since the end of the Second World War, and the consequences of this war are even more terrible.
    The scale of the arms race is expanding, and the army, navy, and air force are constantly being modernized. The greatest achievements in science and technology are being used to produce the most devastating weapons for killing people. The arms race is particularly large in the manufacture of dangerous weapons such as atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. Countless foreign military bases are being established in the territories of other countries, which has caused legitimate concerns in those countries against which these military bases are directed. The establishment of such bases has aggravated the threat to the security of those countries on whose territories these bases are located.
    For many years, the world has been in a state of "cold war," and the burden of military preparations in various countries weighs more heavily on the people of all countries. In some countries, propaganda for another war is openly being carried out. In newspapers, radio stations, and public speeches, calls for war—including atomic war—are becoming more and more frequent. Traditional economic and trade relations that have developed over many years between many countries have been disrupted.
    There is no need to prove that the current international relations are very abnormal. Fundamental measures must be taken to ease international tensions and to establish the necessary and basic trust in international relations, eliminate the danger of new wars, and create conditions for the people of all countries to live a peaceful and tranquil life.
    How can this be done? The first is to stop the "cold war." The Soviet Union believes that the United Nations General Assembly must recommend that all countries take the necessary measures to strictly fulfill the condemnation of any form of propaganda for a new war, and to stop issuing any calls for war and inciting hatred between the people of all countries through newspapers, radio stations, films, and public speeches. Failure to comply with this recommendation should be considered as an act of a country undermining its international responsibilities and its obligations to the United Nations.
    The Soviet Union believes that the immediate withdrawal of their occupation forces from German territory by the four major powers, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—except for a small number of troops that are strictly limited to remain temporarily in German territory pending the conclusion of an agreement on their complete withdrawal—will help to ease international tensions and build the necessary trust between countries.
    The Soviet Union believes that the permanent members of the Security Council must reach an agreement on the abolition of military bases in the territories of other countries.
    The current tensions in some regions of the Far East are fraught with the danger of another war and seriously threaten the maintenance of world peace. The countries concerned must resolve the unresolved issues in the Far East in accordance with the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.
    The Soviet Union suggests that all countries eliminate every form of discrimination in their economic relations that hinders the development of extensive economic cooperation between them, primarily cooperation in trade, and expand international cultural exchanges.
    The implementation of these measures will help to build trust between countries, which is the main prerequisite for achieving an effective and practical solution to the issue of disarmament. If the necessary trust is not established between countries, the issue of disarmament may remain a problem suspended in mid-air. We explicitly advocate turning the issue of disarmament from a problem suspended in mid-air into a problem placed on solid ground, and advocate solving this problem.
    With these goals in mind, the Soviet Union suggests that the United Nations General Assembly, in addition to implementing the above-mentioned suggestions on easing international tensions, instruct the United Nations Disarmament Commission to draft a "Draft International Convention on the Reduction of Armaments and the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, Hydrogen Weapons, and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction" and submit it to the Security Council for approval.
    The Soviet proposals stipulate that the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons should be implemented in two stages over a period of two years, with each stage lasting one year.
    In the first stage, in 1956, the following measures should be taken:
    As a first step, the signatory countries of the convention shall guarantee not to increase their armed forces and armaments beyond the level of armaments and armed forces on December 31, 1954. Appropriations for their military needs shall also be maintained at the level of expenditure in this regard in 1954.
    The Soviet proposals also stipulate the level to which the armies of various countries should be reduced. The armies of the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France should not exceed the following levels:
    United States—one million to one and a half million people.
    Soviet Union—one million to one and a half million people.
    China—one million to one and a half million people.
    Britain—650,000 people.
    France—650,000 people.
    Countries should not possess armies that could pose a threat to international peace.
    The work of reducing the armies and armaments of these five countries to the prescribed levels will be carried out in two equal phases: 50 percent in 1956 and the remaining 50 percent in 1957. At the same time, the appropriations for military needs in these countries should also be reduced accordingly.
    The Soviet proposal stipulates that a world conference should be convened no later than the first half of 1956, with the aim of fully implementing the various measures for universal disarmament and deciding on the level of armament reduction and troops of other countries. The number of troops in other countries, which will be determined by this conference, must be much lower than the level prescribed for the five permanent members of the Security Council.
    The Soviet proposal stipulates that the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons should be stopped as the first step in implementing the plan for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.
    The Soviet proposal also points out that, simultaneously with the commencement of measures to reduce armaments and armed forces, countries must solemnly guarantee not to use nuclear weapons that they deem should be prohibited. An exception to this provision may be allowed if the matter involves defending against aggression and the Security Council passes relevant decisions.
    The new Soviet proposal stipulates that countries that have land, sea, and air force bases in the territories of other countries must guarantee to dismantle part of these bases in 1956.
    The Soviet proposal stipulates that in the second period, that is, in 1957, the following measures shall be implemented:
    First, immediately cease the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons; second, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France shall reduce 50 percent of the difference between the level of their armed forces and armaments on December 31, 1954, and the level that treaties allow them to retain, based on the level of their armed forces and armaments on December 31, 1954.
    After the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments to 75 percent of the total reduction, the complete prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction will be implemented. The elimination of these weapons from armaments, as well as the reduction of the remaining 25 percent of the total reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments, should begin and end simultaneously in 1957.
    The Soviet proposal directs countries to promote the establishment of broad international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. At the same time, special attention should be paid to assisting economically backward countries.
    Finally, the Soviet proposal stipulates that measures to clear all foreign land, sea, and air force bases in the territories of other countries shall be completed during the second period.
    It is quite clear that it is inconceivable to implement all these measures without a practical and genuine system of supervision. Therefore, the issue of supervision is the most important part of the convention.
    It is no accident that the issue of supervision has been the central issue and the main point of contention in discussions in the United Nations agencies for nearly nine years. We believe that these differences are the result of taking an unrealistic attitude toward the issue of supervision. The Soviet government is convinced that effective supervision of the reduction of armaments is possible.
    However, all kinds and forms of supervision and the rights and functions of the supervisory bodies that have been proposed by various countries up to now are unreliable under the current conditions.
    In putting forward new proposals on the issue of supervision, the Soviet government took into account the current relations between countries. As has been said, these relations are characterized by a lack of trust and the existence of suspicion. With these relations, it is impossible to carry out effective supervision on the basis of what was proposed before.
    It is difficult to imagine that countries that distrust each other and are in tense relations would allow supervisory personnel from other countries to actually enter their factories that manufacture atomic materials, atomic weapons, and hydrogen weapons. It has been proven that the governments of some countries are even obstructing visits by cultural, agricultural, and student delegations.
    Even if this supervision could be implemented, it would be ineffective, because, in the absence of mutual trust, it is possible to circumvent this supervision. This situation is possible, especially because the technical procedures of atomic production make it possible for atomic materials used for peaceful purposes to be quickly turned into atomic weapons without special difficulty with the help of certain special equipment. In this case, there may be supervisors, but there is no supervision.
    What should be done in this situation?
    As everyone knows, modern warfare is impossible without mobilizing and concentrating large amounts of land, air, and naval forces. Atomic weapons themselves cannot be effective without the active cooperation of various armed forces; atomic weapons alone cannot determine the outcome of a war. Atomic weapons cannot be used without the tools to transport them to their destination. Therefore, the Soviet proposal on supervision is based on the need to establish a condition that enables the aggressive intentions of any country to be detected and warned in a timely manner.
    We propose: the establishment of a supervision that can prevent dangerous gatherings of land, sea, and air forces in a timely manner. For this purpose, monitoring stations must be set up in major ports, airports, and strategically important transportation points. The establishment of such a supervisory body can completely eliminate the possibility of a sudden invasion by one country against another.
    The Soviet proposal stipulates that effective supervision should be carried out over the reduction of armed forces, conventional armaments, and military appropriations. The international supervisory body established for this purpose should have the right to request countries to report the necessary information on their implementation of measures to reduce armaments and armed forces, and should have the right to inquire without obstruction about the materials on budgetary appropriations for military purposes in various countries.
    In putting forward these proposals, the Soviet government believes that the measures it has proposed on the implementation of supervision in the initial stage will create conditions for easing international tensions and building mutual trust, so that it will be possible to transition to other types of supervision in the future, including supervision over the permanent elimination and abolition of atomic weapons, the details of which will be determined in special instructions after a principled agreement has been reached.
    The purpose of the Soviet Union's new proposals on the issue of disarmament is to spare mankind from the scourge of new wars, ease international tensions, free the people from the heavy burden of taxes due to the constant expansion of armaments, and ensure that the resources that are freed up can be used to improve the material well-being of the people and provide extensive assistance to economically backward countries.
    The Asian-African Conference, which recently closed in Bandung and was attended by twenty-nine countries, vividly demonstrated the current mood of the broad masses of people. This conference attracted worldwide attention, and its good results will play a major role in the cause of peace, freedom, and independence. Although representatives of various social systems participated in the conference, the participants reached unanimously agreed resolutions on all issues discussed. The declaration on promoting universal peace and cooperation adopted by the conference is based on the principles of peaceful coexistence.
    The resolutions of the Asian-African Conference on discussing economic, cultural, and political cooperation illustrate the correct attitude towards international life issues. The conference declared that international disputes should be resolved peacefully through negotiations. This approach is correct and will be fruitful. As everyone knows, not long ago, the Korean War and the Indochina War ended because of this path. Continuing to follow this path in the future will also enable other outstanding issues to be resolved. The Austrian issue is proof of this. The countries concerned have now reached an agreement that the peace treaty on the restoration of an independent and democratic Austria will be signed in Vienna on May 15.
    I would like to return to the issue of European security and say that the Soviet government's starting point remains: in the current situation, organizing a collective security system with the participation of all European countries with different social systems is the best way to ensure peace and prevent the recurrence of aggression in this region.
    The European security issue is a particularly important issue at present. If any issue related to this issue is resolved well, it will help create conditions for the peaceful and tranquil life of the people of all countries. The ratification of the Paris Accords has made it difficult to resolve this issue, but it has not removed this issue from the agenda.
    The Soviet government once called on European countries and the United States to pay attention to the plan to organize a pan-European collective security system, but unfortunately, the Western countries did not support this suggestion at the time, so that this suggestion could not be realized.
    Western countries would rather implement the policy of restoring German militarism and letting it produce all the consequences, would rather implement the policy of establishing the Western European Union, a military group with a remilitarized West Germany participating, but this policy has opened the way for new aggression, deepened the danger of new wars, and created a threat to the national security of peace-loving countries.
    The Soviet government believes that peace-loving countries in Europe should be concerned about guaranteeing their own security in this new environment. This needs to be done according to the principles formulated by the eight countries at the Moscow Conference and in their subsequent consultations. The Soviet government hopes that it will be possible in the future to achieve a guarantee of European security, in which all European countries and the United States will participate.
    The Moscow Conference promoted the further unity of our democratic camp forces and aroused the sympathy of all friends of peace. The people of the countries participating in the conference unanimously supported the work of the conference. The conference once again affirmed the close and sincere friendship between our countries, and expanded the scope of cooperation between our countries. Now this cooperation has also expanded to the question of organizing a common defense.
    The governments of the eight countries, the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, said in the declaration unanimously adopted at the Moscow Conference that the current situation has put on the agenda the task of the countries participating in the conference to jointly guarantee their own security. They also said at the time that urgent measures must be taken to protect their own security by using the combined forces of peace-loving countries to counter the aggressive forces of the military group formed by Western countries.
    The consultations conducted by the countries participating in the Moscow Conference after the Moscow Conference showed that the eight participating countries in the Moscow Conference were in complete agreement on the necessity of signing a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance, as well as on the principles of this treaty.
    As everyone knows, a new type of relationship has emerged between our countries, which is based on common goals and interests, the principle of equality, respect for national sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. Our countries sincerely wish to help each other and achieve universal prosperity. The relationship between our countries embodies the lofty principles of socialist internationalism and the great ideal of the fraternal friendship between the free and equal people of all countries.
    Almost all of our countries are linked by bilateral treaties of friendship and mutual assistance, which have played and continue to play an important role in guaranteeing peace and European security.
    However, this situation is no longer sufficient in the new environment. We all agree that the threat to the security of our countries that has been caused by the aggressive measures of Western countries requires us to unite our forces and take new measures to strengthen the national defense forces of our peace-loving countries. The treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance that we are gathering here to sign should also serve these purposes.
    This treaty should stipulate that in the event that any contracting party is subjected to armed aggression, it shall assume the responsibility of common defense. If such aggression should occur, each contracting party, in accordance with the right of individual or collective self-defense stipulated in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, shall immediately, individually or in coordination with other contracting parties, assist any one or more countries that have been subjected to aggression by all necessary means, including the use of armed forces. In this case, the contracting parties shall consult on common measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.
    According to the Moscow Conference Declaration, the treaty should stipulate the establishment of a Joint Command of Armed Forces to command the armed forces that will be placed under the jurisdiction of this command in accordance with the agreements between the contracting parties. At the same time, note that the contracting parties will take other agreed-upon measures necessary to strengthen their national defense forces in order to ensure the inviolability of their borders and territories and to resist possible aggression.
    According to the draft treaty, the contracting parties will consult on all major international issues that are of common interest to them.
    Naturally, cooperation between the contracting parties will not only include common defense issues, but also issues of further developing and consolidating economic and cultural ties.
    The groups established by the imperialist countries are built on the principle of domination and subordination. That is the essence of those groups, they serve the interests of their organizers—the big imperialist countries. The ruling groups of these major powers drag small countries into the military aggressive groups they have established in order to obtain manpower and ensure the establishment of new military springboards and military bases. At the same time, they also use aggressive groups to make their alliance partners subordinate to them politically and economically. As everyone knows, since the establishment of the North Atlantic Alliance, the economic and political independence of the countries participating in this alliance has suffered great damage. The United States, which plays a major role in this aggressive group, is making other countries participating in this group increasingly subordinate to it.
    The draft treaty we are now discussing is based on a completely different principle. The principle of one country controlling another country and one people controlling another people is irrelevant to these countries of ours, our people, and our social system. Our draft treaty is based on the principle of respecting the sovereignty of other countries and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, which is the basis of the foreign policy of the countries meeting here. As everyone knows, aggressive treaties concluded by imperialist countries exclude the possibility of other countries freely joining them. This cannot be otherwise, because aggressive treaties are concluded in order to use them to oppose other countries. The North Atlantic Treaty can be said to be an example of such a treaty.
    You remember that in March 1954, the Soviet government suggested that the countries concerned jointly study the issue of the Soviet Union joining the North Atlantic Treaty, but the governments of the United States, Britain, and France rejected this suggestion. As a result, they proved to world opinion that the North Atlantic Alliance is an aggressive group against the Soviet Union.
    The draft treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance that our eight countries propose to sign will not take a closed-door approach. All other countries, regardless of their social and national system, can join this treaty. This characteristic of the eight-country treaty proves its defensive nature and the defensive nature of the organization that will be established according to it.
    During the preliminary consultations, we all unanimously concluded that the signing of the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance does not mean that the contracting parties abandon their continued efforts to establish a pan-European collective security system. The draft treaty reflects this, saying that the contracting parties will continue to strive to establish a pan-European collective security system and to sign a pan-European collective security treaty for this purpose. Our draft treaty is based on the principle that once the pan-European collective security system is established, the eight-country treaty will cease to be effective from the time the pan-European treaty comes into effect.
    The draft treaty submitted to this conference is fully in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. I hope that the Soviet Union and all other countries participating in the conference will do everything possible to make the organization that we are about to establish an effective tool for guaranteeing international peace and security on the basis of strict adherence to the United Nations Charter.
    The draft treaty points out that the contracting parties express their willingness to participate in all international actions aimed at guaranteeing international peace and security in the spirit of sincere cooperation, and will contribute all their strength to strive to promote the realization of this goal.
    The countries attending this conference were in the past, and are now, consistently supporting firm universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. This common desire of ours is reflected in the following passage in the draft treaty: The contracting parties will agree with other countries that express their willingness to cooperate in this regard to strive to take effective measures for universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other types of weapons of mass destruction.
    Comrades! Of course, if we sit idly by and take no action, and let them pursue their "position of strength" policy, arm themselves, and impose their will on everyone, then the imperialist camp could not be happier.
    However, the "position of strength" policy has both advantages and disadvantages. If one side increases its strength, then the other side has to do the same.
    As a result, a situation arises that is called the arms race in political terms, and this situation contains a serious threat of the outbreak of war.
    We are not supporters of the "position of strength" policy. We do not want war, do not want an arms race, and we advocate the most fundamental disarmament measures. We would rather use the resources that we now have to spend on military purposes for peaceful needs, to improve the material well-being of our people. But when someone is building a military group to oppose us, surrounding these countries of ours with military bases, and threatening us with atomic war, we cannot but take action. In this case, we have a responsibility to take corresponding measures, and one of these measures is our meeting and the resolutions that we will make at the meeting.
    The Moscow Declaration and the preliminary consultations between the countries participating in this conference show that in order to deal with the revival of German militarism and the new military groups established by the imperialist countries, the countries now attending the conference are full of determination to unite their forces and further strengthen their friendship and cooperation.
    The conclusion of the eight-country treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance will lay an unshakable foundation for peace-loving countries to take joint action to counter the aggression that is now being planned and to guarantee peace and security in Europe.
    The Soviet government firmly believes that the resolutions of this conference will lay a reliable foundation for guaranteeing the security of the countries in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. At the same time, our meeting will be an important step in solving the task of consolidating peace and security in Europe and the world.

### 在欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议五月十一日会议上　苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁的讲话

    在欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议五月十一日会议上
　　苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁的讲话主席同志！代表同志们！
    苏联外交政策的不变原则是不同社会制度共处的列宁主义的原则。苏联政府坚守这一原则，以使人类可以摆脱战争的恐怖和灾难，以使世界各国人民得到安宁。苏联积极为巩固和平和缓和国际紧张局势而斗争，并欢迎其他国家政府在这方面采取的任何步骤。
    因此，苏联政府认为这次将讨论有关保障欧洲和平和安全问题的会议具有特别巨大的意义。
    去年年尾，在欧洲国家的莫斯科会议上，现在到这里来开会的各国政府曾达成了关于巴黎协定一旦批准就有必要再一次研讨局势的协议。
    现在有了这种必要。巴黎协定的批准已经成为事实。这就严重地改变了整个国际局势，使得爱好和平的国家遇到了新的问题。
    在莫斯科会议参加者的发言中以及在他们通过的宣言中，会经深刻地分析了巴黎协定，并且指出了这些协定给欧洲和平事业带来的危险。从那时以后发生的事件证明了这一分析的正确。
    我们必须考虑这一事实：巴黎协定已经被批准，并且正在付诸实施。
    由于巴黎协定被批准，西德军国主义者和复仇分子就有机会公开建立常备军和用各种类型的现代武器，包括原子武器、化学武器和细菌武器来供给这支军队。西德正在变成一个部署大量侵略军的基地。那里正在广泛建筑飞机场、打靶场、营房和仓库。西德军国主义者正在制定使用原子武器的措施。大批美国武器正准备运到西德，同时西德工业的军国主义化也在加紧进行。
    巴黎协定就这样在把进行新侵略和新压迫的工具放到昨天的侵略者和占领者手里。在一代的生活中发动了两次世界大战的德国军国主义再度出现在欧洲和国际舞台上，威胁着国际和平和安全。
    第二次世界大战结束已经十年，西德在美、英、法三国的帮助下，正在成为欧洲战争威胁的主要温床。它正在成为北大西洋侵略集团的一员，而且也是针对着苏联和人民民主国家的西欧军事联盟的一员。
    应该提到，英、法两国已同西德的军国主义者和复仇分子组成了一个军事集团，违背了它们根据在第二次世界大战的年代同苏联所缔结的、对付德国军国主义侵略的条约所承担的义务。因此，英、法两国实际上已废除了这些重要的条约。由于这种情况，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主席团已经在五月七日命令废除这些条约。
    在去年十二月下半月，在莫斯科会议已经开过后举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议通过了一项关于准备原子战争的决议。这也是同巴黎协定直接有关的，并且再度证明了这些协定对欧洲和平事业的威胁。
    这些侵略势力不仅加紧在欧洲的活动。大家知道，目前正在对一些近东和中东国家施加很大的压力，以便迫使它们参加现在正在建立的、作为侵略性的北大西洋联盟的附属机构的军事集团。现在正在对叙利亚、埃及和其他阿拉伯国家以及同苏联接壤的阿富汗施加压力。现在有人正在企图把伊朗拖入侵略集团，虽然根据一九二七年十月一日的苏伊关于保证中立的条约，伊朗已保证不参加任何针对苏联的政治联盟或协定。
    在建立军事联盟的同时，美利坚合众国也正在采取步骤来扩大它的军事基地网、特别是在苏联和各人民民主国家边境附近。目的就在于利用这些基地对我国和其他爱好和平的国家发动空中进攻，这已经是一个公开的秘密了。
    现在正在远东、在台湾地区继续对中华人民共和国采取挑衅行动。非常明显，如果逃到台湾去藏身的蒋介石分子没有得到一个有力的保护者——美国——的支持的话，他们是决不敢进行他们的海盗活动的；美国已把被赶出中国的蒋介石匪帮收录起来为它服务。
    台湾、澎湖列岛和沿海岛屿变成了由美国控制的军队用来对中华人民共和国进行无端的进攻和对在公海上航行的商船采取海盗行为的军事基地。
    美国的官方人士把这种政策叫做“防御共产党的侵略”，虽然全世界都知道，不是别人，正是美国自己霸占了自古以来就是中国的领土——台湾，美国的陆海军将领们正在企图使用原子武器来发动一次大战。
    在东南亚建立了一个名为东南亚条约组织的军事集团，这是西方的殖民国家和某些依赖它们的亚洲国家的联盟，它的目的在于保持和巩固殖民制度、镇压民族解放运动、干涉中华人民共和国和其他亚洲国家的事务。
    因此，像印度、缅甸和印度尼西亚这样一些尊重自由和独立的东南亚国家断然拒绝参加殖民主义者的这个侵略的和反动的集团，是毫不奇怪的。
    从上面所说的可以看出，在重建西德军国主义的同时，全世界的侵略势力的活动加紧了。而西德的“国防军”在其中担负着突击部队的特别角色。
    苏联一贯为缓和国际紧张局势、为维护并加强和平而努力。在这个政策上，苏联政府估计到出席这个会议的爱好和平的国家的支持与合作。苏联政府还相信它的政策也是受到其他国家的爱好和平的力量的支持的。我们的信心是以这样一个事实为基础的：一切国家人民的切身利益要求维护和平和缓和国际紧张局势。
    西欧各国人民反对巴黎协定的斗争已显示出，在那些有人企图使国内的发展和外交政策从属于准备新战争的国家中支持和平的力量是多末壮大。西欧各国的进步力量和人民群众的反对曾经长期地阻止了在西德恢复军国主义的计划的实行。人民群众充分地意识到复活德国军国主义和在欧洲准备新战争的政策的危险。
    苏联曾经是而且依然是西德重新军国主义化政策的一个坚决的、一贯的反对者。在为反对批准巴黎协定而斗争时我们曾认为，正如同我们现在所认为的，西德重新军国主义化和它的参加北大西洋公约组织是按照和平与民主的方针恢复德国的国家统
  一的主要障碍。同时，我们曾经而且现在仍旧支持把德国恢复成为一个统一的自由的、和平的和民主的国家。
    苏联在德国问题上的政策在将来也将从这些基本原则出发。
    因此，有必要采取一切措施来防止德国军国主义的复活并进行广泛的、全力的斗争来反对巴黎协定的实施。在这种新局势下面，也必须为德国的国家统一而努力。要完成这些任务，首先是正在努力防止西德重新军国主义化的德国人民本身的爱国力量应起决定性的作用。
    东德和西德的和睦相处、它们之间的紧张关系的缓和能对统一德国和维护欧洲和平作出重大的贡献。毫无疑问，德国的两部分在建立一个统一、自由和民主的德国方面的一致行动不但是必要的，而且也是完全可能的，因为这是符合全体德国人民的利益的。
    当然，我们不能无视下面的事实：巴黎协定的批准在解决德国问题上已经为德国人民造成了一种新的、整个说来是不利的局势。
    大家知道，苏联政府在它以前的各次声明中一再强调通过有德国的两部分的代表参加的四大国谈判来解决德国国家统一问题的重要性。
    如果美国、英国和法国政府的目的的确是在于德国统一，并且不坚持西德的重新军国主义化和要它加入它们的侵略集团——这当然只能加深德国的分裂，那么苏联所建议的谈判无疑将产生积极的结果。
    然而西方三大国的政府却走了不同的道路。批准了巴黎协定，它们就表明了它们不愿意考虑德国人民的民族利益以及欧洲和平和安全的利益。
    因此，苏联政府将来也还是愿意尽力促进恢复德国的统一；并促进在可以接受的基础上同德国缔结和约。
    苏联一直在支持、而且将继续支持那些关心缓和国际紧张局势并维护和加强普遍和平和安全的国家和力量。
    苏联政府在奥地利问题上所持的态度是符合这种政策的。不能不承认，完全恢复一个中立的奥地利在政治上和经济上的独立，是对巩固欧洲和平的相当大的贡献。奥地利已经出现坚决走这条道路的社会力量，这一事实就证明了各国——不管它们的社会制度如何——之间发展合作的巨大可能性。
    假如认为仅仅是奥地利政府才会持这种态度那就错了。在欧洲和亚洲都有不少的国家不愿意参加军事侵略集团。这类国家的和平愿望将始终得到苏联方面的充分谅解和支持。
    苏联政府在中华人民共和国政府的同意下最近曾采取步骤来缓和台湾地区的紧张局势，并且为此曾同英国和印度政府进行了谈判。
    苏联政府曾提出以下的建议：特别关心调整台湾和其他中国岛屿地区所出现的局势的各国应该举行一次相应的会议来研究这个问题，参加这次会议的除了中华人民共和国和美国以外，还应当有英国、苏联、法国、印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和锡兰。由于美国的反对，会议没有开成。美国坚持蒋介石集团应当参加会议，虽然这个集团除了代表它自己以外不能代表任何人。
    苏联政府方面完全支持中华人民共和国在台湾问题上的立场和人民中国为了巩固那个地区的和平而采取的措施。
    鉴于近东和中东局势的恶化，苏联政府曾在它最近关于那个地区的安全的声明中强调指出，它不能对正在那里产生的局势漠不关心。苏联政府已经宣布：如果对近东和中东国家施用压力和威胁的政策继续下去的话，这个问题就必须由联合国加以考虑。
    苏联政府坚决相信：如果担负着维护和平的主要责任的各国有诚意的话，就有可能解决一些目前阻碍着国际紧张局势的缓和的重大的国际问题。
    苏联政府的领导者们曾经不止一次地声明，他们主张建立正常的国际关系，主张会晤，主张尽可能地扩大贸易和互派文化代表团，一句话，主张可以缓和紧张局势的一切。然而，在这方面，并不是一切都取决于我们的。甚至像互派学生代表团这样一个简单的问题都没有得到积极的解决。我们向美国建议互派学生代表团，但是他们在答复中告诉我们，需要盖指印。为了要缓和国际关系中的紧张局势并积极地解决这个或那个具体问题，就必须在信任和互相谅解的基础上提供令人满意的条件。
    从报纸消息看来，最近，在美国、英国和法国说了并写了不少关于需要举行四大国最高级会议的话。这并不是偶然的。举行这样一个会议的想法已经深入广大人民的心，他们对这个会议寄托着很大的希望，认为会议将有助于改善国际关系。这种情绪是不能忽视的。
    苏联政府对举行大国会议的主张采取肯定的态度。当然，举行这样一个会议将是适宜的，如果它真正能够促进国际紧张局势的缓和并改善国际关系的话。
    昨天，五月十日，苏联政府接到了美国政府以及法国政府和英国政府的一个照会。这个照会建议召开有外长参加的四大国政府首脑会议。苏联政府将仔细地研究这个照会。
    一贯努力加强和平和缓和国际紧张局势的苏联政府，正继续采取措施来就禁止原子武器、裁减军备和武装部队以及消除新战争威胁达成协议。
    今天各报刊载了苏联政府关于这个问题的一个新建议。
    苏联提出的将要求联合国大会考虑的新建议具有重大的意义，并且是对和平事业的一个重大贡献。它们将导致国际紧张局势的缓和，并且为建立各国之间的必要的信任和相互谅解创造条件。
    苏联的宣言说，最近才经历了在人力和物力上造成大量损失的第二次世界大战的各国人民，比以往任何时候更强烈地表现了要求和平的坚决意志。各国人民这种深切地要求和平的愿望已经取得了某些成果，但是，尽管如此，世界某些地区的形势不但没有得到改善，相反地，变得日益复杂了，各国之间的互不信任一直在增加着。
    宣言说：“各国之间的关系中缺乏必要的信任是妨碍欧洲和亚洲的悬而未决的问题得到调整的主要原因。对维护普遍和平和各国间的安全负有主要责任的各大国之间的关系，尤其是如此。”
    大国关系中的不信任产生了一种形势：自从第二次世界大战结束后，另一次战争的威胁又形成了，而这个战争的后果是更为可怕的。
    军备竞赛的规模日益扩大，陆军、海军和空军部队正在不断地现代化。科学和技术方面最大的成就被用来生产屠杀人民的毁灭性最大的武器。军备竞赛在制造像原子弹和氢弹这种危险的武器方面的规模特别巨大。无数的外国军事基地正在其他国家的领土上建立起来，这引起了这些军事基地的矛头所指的那些国家的正当的忧虑。这种基地的建立加重了对那些领土上有这些基地的国家的安全的威胁。
    世界许多年来一直处在“冷战”的状态中，同时各国的军事准备的担子更沉重地压在各国人民的身上。在一些国家中公开地进行着另一次战争的宣传。在报纸、电台和公开的演说中号召进行战争——包括原子战争——的事是越来越频繁了。许多国家之间在许多年过程中发展起来的传统的经济和贸易关系已经被打乱了。
    目前的国际关系是十分不正常的，这是用不着证明的。必须采取根本的措施来缓和国际紧张局势并且在国际关系中建立必要的、基本的信任，消除新战争的危险，并为各国人民创造一个和平的宁静的生活的条件。
    怎么才能作到这点呢？首先是停止“冷战”。苏联认为联合国大会必须建议所有国家采取必要措施来严格履行关于谴责任何形式的新战争宣传，停止通过报刊、电台、电影和公开的演说来发出任何战争号召和煽动各国人民之间的仇恨。不遵从这种建议的行为应该被认为是一个国家破坏它的国际责任和它对联合国的义务的行为。
    苏联认为，苏联、美利坚合众国、英国和法国四大国立即从德国领土上撤退它们的占领军——除了加以严格限制的少数军队暂时留在德国领土上以待缔结关于它们全部撤退的协定以外，将有助于缓和国际紧张局势和建立各国之间的必要的信任。
    苏联认为，安全理事会的常任理事国必须就取消在他国领土上的军事基地达成协议。
    远东某些地区目前的紧张局势充满着另一次战争的危险，而且严重地威胁着世界和平的维持。有关国家必须根据主权和领土完整原则来解决远东的悬而未决的问题。
    苏联建议各国在它们的经济关系中消除阻碍它们之间的广泛经济合作，首先是贸易方面的合作的发展的每一种歧视，并且扩大国际间的文化交流。
    这些措施的执行将有助于在各国之间建立信任，这是使裁军问题获得有效的和切实的解决的主要先决条件。如果不在各国之间建立必要的信任，裁军问题可能仍旧是一个悬在半空中的问题。我们明确地主张把裁军问题从一个悬在半空中的问题变成一个放在坚实土地上的问题，并且主张解决这个问题。
    怀着这些目的，苏联建议联合国大会除了实施上述的关于缓和国际紧张局势的建议之外，指令联合国裁军委员会起草一个“关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约”的草案，提交安全理事会批准。
    苏联的建议规定裁减军备和禁止原子武器应该在两年期间分为两个阶段执行，每个阶段为时一年。
    在第一阶段一九五六年中，应该采取下列措施：
    公约的签字国保证不把它们的武装部队和军备增加到超过一九五四年十二月三十一日的军备和武装部队的水平，作为第一个步骤。它们的军事需要方面的拨款也要维持在一九五四年的这方面费用的水平上。
    苏联的建议还规定各国军队所应裁减的水平。美国、苏联、中国、英国和法国的军队不应当超过下列水平：
    美国——一百万到一百五十万人。
    苏联——一百万到一百五十万人。
    中国——一百万到一百五十万人。
    英国——六十五万人。
    法国——六十五万人。
    各国不应当拥有可能对国际和平造成威胁的军队。
    裁减这五个国家的军队和军备到规定的水平的工作将分两个相等的阶段来进行：一九五六年裁减百分之五十，一九五七年裁减其余的百分之五十。与此同时，这些国家用于军事需要的拨款也要相应地减少。
    苏联的建议规定，不迟于一九五六年上半年应当召开一次世界会议，目的是完全实施普遍裁军的各项措施并决定其他国家的裁减军备和军队的水平的问题。将由这次会议来决定的其他国家的军队的人数必须大大低于替安全理事会五个常任理事国所规定的水平。
    苏联的建议规定停止进行原子武器和氢武器的试验，以作为实行裁减军备和禁止原子武器的计划的第一步措施。
    苏联的建议还指出，与开始采取裁减军备与武装部队的措施同时，各国要庄严保证不使用它们认为应该禁用的核子武器。如果事情牵涉到对侵略进行防御，并有安全理事会通过有关的决定，那么这一规定的例外是可以被允许的。
    苏联的新建议规定，在他国领土上拥有陆、海、空军基地的国家保证在一九五六年内撤除这些基地的一部分。
    苏联的建议规定在第二期，即在一九五七年内，实行下列的措施：
    第一，立即停止原子武器和氢武器的生产；第二，美国、苏联、中国、英国和法国以它们在一九五四年十二月三十一日的武装部队和军备的水平和条约允许它们保有的水平为根据，再裁减两者之间的差数的百分之五十。
    在武装部队和常规军备裁减到裁减总数的百分之七十五以后，原子武器与其他大规模毁灭性武器的完全禁止即付诸实行。从军备中排除这些武器以及裁减武装部队和常规军备的裁减总数的其余百分之二十五，应在一九五七年同时开始并且结束。
    苏联的建议责成各国在和平利用原子能方面促进建立广泛的国际合作。同时应当特别注意援助经济落后的国家。
    最后，苏联的建议规定在第二个时期内完成清除外国在其他国家领土上的所有的海陆空军基地的措施。
    十分明显，没有切实可行的和真正的监督制度，要实现所有这些措施是不可思议的事情。因此，监督问题是公约中最重要的一个部分。
    将近九年来，监督问题一直是联合国机构中讨论的中心问题和主要的分歧之点，这不是偶然的。我们认为，这些分歧是对监督问题采取不现实的态度的结果。苏联政府深信，对裁减军备进行有效的监督是可能的。
    但是，到现在为止各国所建议的一切种类和形式的监督以及监督机构的权利和职能，在目前的条件下都是不可靠的。
    苏联政府在提出关于监督问题的新建议时，它考虑到了目前各国之间的关系。已经说过了，这种关系的特点是缺乏信任和存在着怀疑。有着这种关系，就不可能实现在以前所提出的基础上进行有效的监督。
    很难想像，互不信任和处在紧张关系中的国家会让其他国家的监督人员真正进入自己的制造原子物质、原子武器和氢武器的工厂。事实证明，有些国家的政府甚至对文化、农业、学生代表团的访问都在加以阻挡。
    这种监督即使有可能实行，也会是没有效力的，因为，在缺乏互相信任的情况下，规避这种监督是可能的。这种情况之所以可能，尤其因为，原子生产的技术程序使得供和平使用的原子物质，只要借助某些特别装备就可以没有特别困难地迅速变成原子武器。这一来，可能有监督员，但是没有监督。
    在这种情况下怎么办呢？
    大家知道，现代的战争不出动和集中大量的陆军、空军和海军的力量是不可能的。原子武器本身如果没有各种武装部队的积极配合，是不可能有效果的，单单原子武器不能决定战争的胜负。原子武器没有把它运到目的地的工具就不能够使用。因此，苏联关于监督的建议根据的是必须建立一种条件，使任何国家的侵略意图都能够及时地被发觉和受到警告。
    我们建议：建立一种能够及时防止陆、海、空军的危险集结的监督。为此，必须在各大港口、飞机场和具有战略意义的交通点上设有监察所。建立这种监督机构可以完全消除一个国家对另一个国家的突然侵犯。
    苏联的建议规定对裁减武装部队、常规军备和军事拨款进行有效的监督。为实现这个目的而建立的国际监督机构应有权要求各国报告它们执行裁减军备和武装部队措施的必要的情况，并且有权毫无阻碍地查问各国有关军事用途的预算拨款的材料。
    苏联政府提出这些建议时认为，它所提出的关于在最初时期实行监督的措施，将为缓和国际紧张局势和建立相互信任创造条件，从而可以在今后过渡到其他种类的监督，其中包括对永远消灭和取消原子武器的监督，这种监督的详细内容在达成原则上的协议后将在特别指令中确定。
    苏联的关于裁军问题的新建议所抱定的目的是：使人类免遭新战争的浩劫，缓和国际紧张局势，使人民摆脱由于不断地扩充军备而承受的沉重的赋税负担，保证有可能将解放出来的资源用于提高人民的物质福利和给予经济落后的国家以广泛援助。
    最近在万隆闭幕的有二十九个国家参加的亚非会议，生动地表明了广大人民群众目前的情绪。这次会议吸引了全世界的注意，它的良好结果将在争取和平、自由和独立的事业中起重大的作用。虽然参加这次会议的有各种社会制度的代表，但是会议参加者就一切讨论的问题通过了一致同意的决议。会议通过的关于促进普遍和平和合作的宣言是以和平共处的原则为基础的。
    讨论经济、文化和政治合作问题的亚非会议的决议，说明了对待国际生活问题的正确态度。会议声明，应当用和平方式通过谈判来解决国际争端。这种途径是正确的，会有成果的。大家知道，在不久以前，由于走了这条道路，朝鲜战争和印度支那战争停止了。今后沿着这条道路走，也能使其他悬而未决的问题得到解决。奥地利问题就是一个证明。现在有关国家已经达成这样一个协议：关于恢复独立和民主的奥地利的和约将于五月十五日在维也纳签字。
    我想回过来谈谈欧洲安全问题，我要讲的是，苏联政府的出发点仍然是：在现在的情况下，组织有各种社会制度不同的所有欧洲国家参加的集体安全体系，是保证和平和防止这一地区侵略重演的最好办法。
    欧洲安全问题是目前特别重要的一个问题。有关这个问题的任何问题如果得到良好的解决，都会有助于为各国人民和平的和安宁的生活创造条件。巴黎协定的批准使这个问题的解决遇到了困难，但是并没有把这个问题从日程上取消掉。
    苏联政府曾经提请欧洲国家和美国重视组织全欧集体安全体系的方案，然而非常遗憾，当时西方国家却没有支持这个建议，以致使这个建议不能实现。
    西方国家宁愿执行恢复德国军国主义，任其产生一切后果的政策，宁愿执行规定建立西欧联盟这样一个有重新军国主义化的西德参加的军事集团的政策，但是，这种政策为新的侵略开辟了道路，加深了发生新战争的危险，造成了对爱好和平国家的国家安全的威胁。
    苏联政府认为，欧洲爱好和平的国家在这种新的环境下应该关心保障自己的安全。这需要根据八国在莫斯科会议上以及在它们以后的磋商中所拟定的原则来做。苏联政府希望，将来有可能达到这样一种欧洲安全的保障，参加这种安全保障的将包括所有欧洲国家和美国。
    莫斯科会议促进了我们民主阵营力量的进一步团结，引起了所有和平朋友们的同情。而会议参加国的人民则一致拥护这次会议的工作。会议又一次肯定了我们各国之间的亲密而真诚的友谊，使我们国家之间的合作范围扩大了，现在这种合作还扩大到关于组织共同防御的问题方面。
      苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚八国政府在莫斯科会议所一致通过的宣言中说，目前形成的局势使参加会议的国家把共同努力保障自己安全的任务提到日程上来。它们当时还说，必须采取迫切的措施，用爱好和平的国家联合起来的力量来对抗西方国家所组成的军事集团的侵略势力，以保障自己的安全。
    莫斯科会议参加国在莫斯科会议后进行的磋商，说明了莫斯科会议的八个参加国对签订友好、合作和互助条约的必要性以及对这一条约的原则的看法是完全一致的。
    大家知道，我们各国之间产生了史无前例的新型关系，这种关系是以共同的目的和利益、平等原则、尊重国家主权和不干涉内政为基础的。我们各国真诚愿望互相帮助和取得普遍的高涨。我们各国之间的关系体现了社会主义的国际主义的崇高原则、体现了自由和平等的各国人民之间的兄弟友谊的伟大理想。
    我们各国之间几乎全都由双边的友好、互助条约联系起来，这些条约在保障和平和欧洲安全方面过去起了、现在继续起着重要的作用。
    但是，在新的环境中，这种情况已经不够了。我们大家都同意，西方国家的侵略措施对我们各国的安全已经造成的威胁，要求我们联合起我们的力量，并采取加强我们爱好和平的国家的国防力量的新措施。我们聚集在这里所要签订的友好、合作和互助条约也应当是为这些目的服务的。
    这个条约应当规定，一旦某个缔约国遭到武装侵犯时，要承担共同防御的责任。如果这种侵犯竟然发生，那么每一个缔约国，根据联合国宪章第五十一条所规定的实行单独或集体的自卫权利，应当立即用一切必要的手段，包括使用武装力量在内，来单独地或同其他缔约国协同援助遭到侵犯的某个国家或某些国家。在这种情况下，缔约国应当就为恢复和维护国际和平和安全所必需的共同措施进行协商。
    根据莫斯科会议宣言，条约应当规定建立武装部队联合司令部来统率将根据缔约国之间的协定拨给这个司令部管辖的武装部队。同时注意到，缔约国将采取为加强它们的国防力量所必要的其他一致同意的措施，以保障它们的边境和领土的不可侵犯和抵御可能遭到的侵略。
    依据条约草案，缔约国将就一切有关它们的共同利益的重大国际问题进行磋商。
    自然，缔约国之间的合作将不仅包括共同防御问题，而且还包括进一步发展和巩固经济和文化联系的问题。
    帝国主义国家所建立的集团是建筑在统治和从属的原则上的。那些集团的本质就是如此，它们是为自己的组织者——大帝国主义国家的利益效劳的。这些大国的统治集团把小国拖进它们所建立的军事侵略集团中去，是为了获得人力和保证建立新的军事跳板和军事基地。同时它们还利用侵略集团来使它们的同盟伙伴在政治上和经济上从属于它们。大家知道，自从北大西洋联盟成立之后，参加这一联盟的国家在经济上和政治上的独立都遭受到巨大的损害。在这一侵略集团中起主要作用的美国使参加这一集团的其他国家越来越屈从于它。
    我们现在所讨论的条约草案是根据完全不同的另一种原则。一个国家控制另一个国家、一国人民控制另一国人民的原则对我们这些国家、我们人民和我们的社会制度来说是毫不相干的。我们的条约草案是从尊重别国主权和不干涉别国内政的原则出发的，这就是在这里开会的各国的外交政策的基础。大家知道，帝国主义国家所缔结的侵略性条约排除其他国家自由参加进去的可能性。也不能不是这样，因为侵略条约就是为了利用它们来反对其他国家才缔结的。北大西洋公约就可以说是这种条约的例子。
    你们记得，一九五四年三月苏联政府曾建议同有关国家共同研究关于苏联加入北大西洋公约的问题，而美国、英国和法国政府拒绝了这一建议。因而它们在世界舆论面前证明了北大西洋联盟是反对苏联的侵略集团。
    我们八国建议签订的友好、合作和互助条约草案将不采取关门态度。所有其他国家，不问它们的社会和国家制度如何，都可以加入这一条约。八国条约的这种特点证明它的防御性质以及根据它而将成立的那个组织的防御性质。
    在事先磋商的过程中，我们大家都一致得出结论，友好、合作和互助条约的签订并不意味着缔约国放弃继续努力建立全欧集体安全体系。条约草案反映了这一点，其中说，缔约国今后仍将不断争取建立全欧集体安全体系和为此目的签订全欧集体安全条约。我们的条约草案本着这样的原则：全欧集体安全体系一旦建立，八国条约将自全欧条约生效之时起停止它的效力。
    提交给我们这次会议的条约草案完全符合联合国宪章的宗旨和原则。我希望，苏联和所有其他参加会议的国家尽一切努力在严格遵守联合国宪章的基础上使我们即将建立的组织成为保证国际和平和安全的有效工具。
    条约草案指出，缔约国表示愿意本着真诚合作的精神参加旨在保证国际和平和安全的所有国际行动，并将贡献出自己的全部力量为促使这个目的的实现而努力。
    出席这次会议的国家过去是，现在也是一贯支持坚决的普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器的。我们这种共同愿望反映在条约草案中的这样一段话里：缔约国将和其他表示愿意在这方面合作的国家协议，争取采取普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他类型大规模毁灭性武器的有效措施。
    同志们！当然，如果我们坐视不动，不采取任何措施，而让他们奉行自己的“实力地位”政策，武装起来，把自己意志强加给所有的人，那么这是帝国主义阵营再高兴不过的了。
    但是，“实力地位”政策是利弊兼有的。如果一方面增加自己的力量，那么另一方面也不得不这样做。
    结果是产生了在政治术语中叫做军备竞赛情况，这种情况蕴藏着爆发战争的严重威胁。
    我们不是“实力地位”政策的拥护者。我们不希望战争，不希望军备竞赛，我们主张最治本的裁军措施。我们宁愿把我们现在不得不花费在军事用途上面的资源用于和平的需要，用来提高我们人民的物质福利。但是当有人在建立军事集团来反对我们、用军事基地来包围我们这些国家并用原子战争来威胁我们的时候，我们就不能不采取行动。在这种情况下，我们有责任采取对应措施，而这些措施之一，就是我们的会议和我们在会议上将要作出的决议。
    莫斯科宣言和这个会议参加国之间进行的初步磋商表明：为了对付德国军国主义的复活和帝国主义国家建立的新的军事集团，现在出席会议的各国充满决心要团结自己的力量，更加加强它们的友谊和合作。
    八国友好、合作和互助条约的缔结，将为爱好和平的国家采取联合行动以回击现在正在策划中的侵略，以保障欧洲的和平和安全奠定不可动摇的基础。
    苏联政府坚信，这个会议的决议将为保障和平、民主和社会主义阵营各国的安全打下可靠的基础。同时，我们的会议将是解决巩固欧洲和世界和平和安全的任务的一个重要的步骤。
