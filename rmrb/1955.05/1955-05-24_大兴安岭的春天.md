　　Spring in the Greater Khingan Range
　　By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun
    May, and spring has finally arrived in the Greater Khingan Range.

    In the primeval forests of the Greater Khingan Range, sparsely populated for thousands of years, this year's spring will no longer be silent. The state has organized a forest survey team of more than two thousand people to conduct a comprehensive survey and measurement here. This year's survey work will be carried out in two locations: the northeastern part of the Greater Khingan Range (east of the Nen River and west of the Gan River) and the northwestern part (east of the Ergun River on the Inner Mongolia border). In early May, the first batch of over three hundred surveyors, carrying a large amount of dry food, tents, instruments, and medicines, entered the Greater Khingan Range. The remaining forest survey team members will also set off for the Greater Khingan Range.

    As early as last autumn, a reconnaissance team of dozens of people inserted themselves into the primeval forest to conduct reconnaissance in the areas scheduled for investigation this year. As they advanced, they cut down trees to build roads, open up transportation routes, determine the distribution locations of the survey teams, and establish many supply stations and hundreds of warehouses. Last winter, braving the severe cold of minus forty degrees Celsius, a large-scale winter transport operation was carried out. Thousands of carts transported millions of pounds of supplies into the depths of the primeval forest. The warehouses now store enough rice, flour, oil, dried vegetables, canned goods, and other food to last the whole year. The supply station stores will also fully supply the surveyors with daily necessities such as shirts, shoes, soap, toothpaste, cigarettes, and candy. Along the routes taken by the survey team, tents for camping have been set up, and stoves and cooking utensils have been installed for heating and cooking.

    The survey work of the Greater Khingan Range primeval forest is planned to be completed in four years, and this year will complete about 35% of the total task. This year, the survey team members will work and live in the primeval forest for seven months, and the natural conditions will bring them many difficulties. However, they are all people of strong will, and they have the confidence to overcome difficulties and achieve complete victory.

　　大兴安岭的春天
　　本报记者　金雨困
    五月，春天才来到了大兴安岭。
    几千年来人迹少到的大兴安岭原始森林中，今年的春天将不再沉寂。国家已组成二千多人的森林调查队，将在这里进行全面的测量调查。今年的调查工作将在大兴安岭的东北部（嫩江以东甘河以西地区）和西北部（内蒙边境额尔古纳河以东地区）两处进行。五月上旬第一批三百余名测量队员，带着大量干粮、帐篷、仪器和药品等，进入了大兴安岭。其余的森林调查队员们亦将随着向大兴安岭进发。
    远在去年秋天，数十人组成的侦察队，就插进原始森林，在预计今年要调查的地区进行了踏查，他们一边前进，一边砍树修路，开辟交通路线，确定调查队的分布位置，设立许多供应站和上百个仓库。去年冬天，冒着零下四十多度的严寒，就进行了规模巨大的冬运工作。上千辆的大车将数百万斤物资，运入了原始森林的深部。在仓库中现在已储放了足够全年食用的大米、面粉、油脂、干菜和罐头等。供应站的小卖店也将充分供应调查队员们所需的衬衫、鞋子、香皂、牙膏、纸烟、糖果等日用物品。在调查队所经的途中，已架设好宿营用的帐篷和装置了取暖的火炉和锅碗等用具。
    大兴安岭原始森林的调查工作计划在四年内完成，今年将完成全部任务的百分之三十五左右。今年，调查队的队员们，将在原始森林中工作和生活七个月，自然条件将带给他们许多困难。但是，他们都是些意志坚定的人，他们有信心战胜困难，取得完全胜利。
