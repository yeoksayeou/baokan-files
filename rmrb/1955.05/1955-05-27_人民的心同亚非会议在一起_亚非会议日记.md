The People's Hearts are with the Asian-African Conference
　　——Asian-African Conference Diary

    First Arrival in Jakarta
    April 16th, Saturday
    Looking down from the plane, the color of the seawater changed from deep blue to light green. Behind a small island, a vast coastline gradually appeared below. "Java," a Indonesian friend sitting behind said, "We have arrived in the airspace of Indonesia."
    The massive silhouette of Jakarta immediately appeared before my eyes. Looking down from the plane, almost all the roofs were red. They formed a vivid pattern with the surrounding lush green tropical trees.
    Soon after, the plane landed at Kemayoran Airport. The time was 6:00 PM. From the plane, we could see dense crowds of people. As soon as the cabin door opened, a shower of applause, like a tropical downpour, rushed in with the hot and humid air of the equator.
    The first to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai were Indonesian Foreign Minister Sunaryo and Chinese Ambassador Huang Zhen.
    In front of the reception room stood twenty-nine flagpoles, flying the colorful national flags of twenty-nine countries. The reception room and corridors were decorated with coconut leaves and flowers. This "gateway to Indonesia" was adorned to welcome distinguished guests.
    The streets outside the airport were lined with crowds. Wherever the cars of the Chinese delegation, flying the Five-Star Red Flag, went, cheers and applause erupted. Countless people came to welcome the Chinese delegation, but we always felt that a few people were missing. This feeling weighed on our hearts like lead.
    Yes, Shi Zhiang, Li Zhaoji, Zhong Buyun, Shen Jiantu, Huang Zuomei, Du Hong, Li Ping, Hao Fengge were missing... They should have been here. Nine days ago, we left Beijing together. At that time, we shook hands and said, "See you in Jakarta." We had planned that they would be here to welcome us, and now we have arrived, but where are they?
    They are now at the bottom of the sea off Sarawak. Seven days ago, they sacrificed themselves in their posts because they were assassinated by American and Chiang Kai-shek's agents.
    After arriving at the embassy, when we saw the news in the newspaper that Beijing was going to hold a memorial service for the martyrs tomorrow, a pang of pain seized everyone's hearts.
    In the evening, the Delegation of the People's Republic of China issued a telegram of condolence, expressing our shared feelings.
    Upon arriving in Jakarta, the real sense of the problems facing the Asian-African Conference began to intensify. The enthusiasm shown by the people of Jakarta showed the great hope contained in this conference, while on the other hand, the difficulties that the conference had to overcome could also be seen.
    From the Jakarta newspapers, it could be seen that although the United States did not participate in the Asian-African Conference, it sent the largest "delegation"—a group of nearly seventy reporters, many of whom only took up journalism in the last few days.
    There was also news that the American secret service was instructing Chiang Kai-shek's terrorist organization in Indonesia, the "Iron Blood Corps," to collude with armed bandits in Indonesia, preparing to launch harassment and assassinations during the Asian-African Conference. ... and so on.
    There are indeed many thorns ahead, but we all believe that "the cause of peace can never be undermined by despicable conspiracies."
    The night was already very late, well past twelve o'clock, but the Jalan Gajah Mada in front of the embassy was still full of people, both Chinese and Indonesian.

    Bandung on the Eve of the Conference
    April 17th, Sunday
    Everyone got up at six o'clock in the morning, as we were going to Bandung this morning.
    It was so early, yet Jalan Gajah Mada had gathered more and more people. They wanted to see or see again the representatives of the new China, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai.
    As yesterday, our cars drove to Kemayoran Airport through walls of people, amidst cheers and applause.
    At 9:30, the plane took off. The coastal plains slowly disappeared from view, replaced by clusters of unusually pointed mountain peaks. White clouds drifted like light gauze around the waists of the peaks. Below, layer upon layer of terraced fields filled with water, like inlaid mother-of-pearl, glittered under the lush shade of tropical plants. What beautiful mountains and rivers, what diligent people!
    The scorching air of Jakarta gradually receded, and the body gradually became cooler. Thirty minutes later, the plane landed at Andir Airport in Bandung. This city is a cool retreat center. By Chinese standards, the climate here is almost a season different from Jakarta. If the latter is midsummer, then this is early autumn.
    Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo personally came to the airport to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai.
    Achmad, chairman of the "Bandung People's Committee for Welcoming the Asian-African Conference," representing 120 organizations in Bandung, delivered a eulogy to Premier Zhou Enlai. Then, an Indonesian girl placed a garland on Premier Zhou Enlai, and two overseas Chinese students presented flowers.
    In the reception room at the airport, Premier Zhou Enlai's written statement was distributed to the press.
    The written statement said: "The delegation of the People's Republic of China is coming to participate in the Asian-African Conference to be held in Bandung with fervent wishes for peace and friendship."
    In this statement, Premier Zhou Enlai also mentioned the plane assassination incident of April 11, saying: "I cannot but point out that there are some people who do not like our conference. They are trying to undermine our conference... But... I believe that our conference will be able to overcome all kinds of sabotage and obstruction, and make valuable contributions to promoting friendship and cooperation between Asian and African countries, and to maintaining peace in the Asian and African regions and the world."
    Subsequent facts will confirm the above predictions.
    Leaving the airport, Jalan Andir was lined with people from Bandung. When the cars of the Chinese delegation drove through the crowd under the guidance of whistling military motorcycles, people forgot everything and applauded and cheered. Along the way, one could hear "Long live peace!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Chinese-Indonesian friendship!" shouted in various languages. There was Indonesian, English, Chaozhou dialect, Cantonese, and even awkward Mandarin.
      A young Chinese mother, squeezed behind the crowd, let her daughter, who looked no more than two years old, sit on her shoulders, vigorously shaking the child's arms. From her smiling face, one could seem to hear her saying: "Wave, child! They are from our motherland, they are our relatives."
    Many of them had already waited for a day yesterday, braving the scorching sun at noon and the sudden rain in the evening, because there was news that the delegation of the People's Republic of China was arriving yesterday.
    The conference in Independence Building had not yet begun, and only a few staff members were busy making final arrangements. However, the street in front of the door was already crowded with people.
    Just a few years ago, this house that everyone looked up to was still a Dutch nightclub called "De Daghleykse Club." For seventy-five years, the Dutch colonialists, Japanese occupiers, Westerling bandits, foreign capitalists and schemers had been able to come here and the Hotel Homann across the street, which belonged to the foreign hotel trust system. The ordinary Indonesian people who built this building with their own blood and sweat could not enter or get close to it. For seventy-five years, this place had been the source of countless conspiracies to enslave and persecute the Indonesian people, a "den of vice" concentrating all kinds of licentiousness and sin. Only now, for the first time, has it washed away the filth on its body and served the Indonesian people, the interests of Asian and African countries, and world peace.
      More than a week ago, by order of President Sukarno, "De Daghleykse Club" was renamed Independence Building, and East Street in front of the building was renamed Jalan Asia Afrika.
    Now, people gather on Jalan Asia Afrika, gazing at Independence Building. From their excited faces, one can see the excited emotions in their hearts. Because this building itself is a symbol of colonialism from rampant to failure, and a symbol of the colonial people from humiliation to independence.
    Opposing colonialism and demanding national independence are the common aspirations of Asian and African countries and peoples, and an important topic of the Asian-African Conference. Precisely because of this, many colonial people who are fighting for national independence have sent their representatives to Bandung to seek sympathy and support.
    In the evening, the representatives of Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria, three North African French colonies who came to participate in the Asian-African Conference as observers, held a press conference at Hotel Homann.
    At the meeting, Youssef of Tunisia and Fassi of Morocco issued a statement saying: "We recognize that the conference is determined to eliminate colonialism everywhere, but we who are still living under colonial rule cannot ignore the fact that some colonial countries and their allies have recently expressed a consistent and firm intention to confront us, forming a dangerous situation... The North African delegation believes that the Bandung Conference is a qualified organization to recommend and decide appropriate measures to end colonialism in North Africa."
    Earlier today, Kotane of the African National Congress of South Africa and Cachalia of the South African Indian Congress also distributed a written statement, demanding that the white supremacists ruling the Union of South Africa "abandon unfair and disastrous policies of racial segregation and racial discrimination."
    Representatives of the Malayan people also distributed similar declarations, demanding that the Asian-African Conference help the Malayan people get rid of foreign colonial rule.
    All of these are just and proper calls from the colonial people. However, they aroused the fear of the colonialists.
    The North African delegation's press conference particularly highlighted this point. The imperialist "reporters" who came to the reception to "interview" the news actually offered "opinions" on Youssef and Fassi's statement, saying that the statement was "too extreme."
    The most famous of these "reporters" was Congressman Powell from New York State in the United States. When Fassi replied to the provocative questions of other "reporters," saying that the Moroccan people would never recognize France's transfer of military bases in Morocco to the United States, Powell's face changed. "Face discolored"—that was how a Reuters reporter described him.
    Shortly after this press conference, Congressman Powell, who had recently obtained reporter status to participate in the Asian-African Conference and did not shy away from being an observer of the United States government, held his own press conference.
    The purpose of his entire speech was to cover up American racism. However, Mr. Powell did not have any arguments to support his lies. His only magic weapon was "personal testimony," using his own experience of being able to rise to prominence despite being black to prove that the United States did not have the kind of discrimination against blacks that everyone knew.
    Powell's reception was just a joke of "here is buried treasure, no silver is buried here," but it reminded people that some people feared the anti-colonialism and anti-war movement, and they were actively working here, trying to reverse right and wrong and shift the focus of the Asian-African Conference against colonialism and war.
    News received in the evening said that all the heads of delegations who had arrived in Bandung held an informal meeting at Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo's villa this afternoon and reached an agreement on the rules of procedure and agenda of the meeting. Everyone is expecting the conference to open smoothly tomorrow.
    The Bandung people's welcome to the Asian-African Conference reached a climax with the torchlight parade in the evening. At about seven o'clock, more than 3,000 young people, arranged in rows of five, carrying torches, paraded back and forth in front of Hotel Homann, Hotel Preanger, and Independence Building on Jalan Asia Afrika. The masses standing on both sides of the street responded with enthusiastic cheers.
    For a Chinese person, this scene gives a feeling similar to New Year's Eve. Tonight, the lights have been on in many delegations' rooms and villas. People will get little sleep tonight. Everyone is working hard to prepare for a new historical moment that is about to arrive. (To be continued)

　　人民的心同亚非会议在一起
　　——亚非会议日记
　　李慎之　张彦
    初到雅加达
    四月十六日　星期六
    从飞机上看下去，海水的颜色由深蓝变成了浅绿，在一个一个小岛后面一片广阔的海岸渐渐在底下出现。“爪哇”，坐在后面的一位印度尼西亚朋友这样说，“我们来到印度尼西亚的土地上空了。”
    雅加达的巨大的身影马上在眼底出现。从飞机上看下去，几乎所有的屋顶都是红色的。它们和四周浓绿的热带树木构成一幅色彩鲜明的图案。
    不久以后，飞机就在玛腰兰机场着陆了。时间是下午六点钟。打飞机上就可以看到密密层层的人群。舱门一打开，急雨似的掌声就立刻随着赤道上又热又湿的空气冲了进来。
    首先前来欢迎周恩来总理的是印度尼西亚外交部长苏纳约和中国大使黄镇。
    接待室前面高高地竖起了二十九根旗杆，上面飘扬着二十九国彩色斑斓的国旗。接待室里和过道上都装饰了椰子树叶和花草。这个“印度尼西亚的大门”已经盛装起来，迎接贵宾。
    机场外面的大街两旁都是人群。飘着五星红旗的中国代表团的汽车走到哪里，哪里就爆发起欢呼和掌声。无数的人来欢迎中国代表团，然而，我们却总觉得缺少了几个人，这种感觉像一块铅一样压在心上。
    是的，是缺少了石志昂、李肇基、钟步云，缺少了沈建图、黄作梅、杜宏、李平、郝凤格……。他们本来应该在这里。九天以前，我们一同离开北京。当时，我们握着手说：“雅加达见”。我们计算好了他们会在这里欢迎我们，现在，我们到了，他们呢？
    他们现在是在沙涝越的海底。七天以前，他们因为被美国和蒋介石的特务暗害而牺牲在自己的岗位上了。
    到大使馆以后，看到报上登载的消息说，北京明天要为烈士们举行追悼大会的时候，一阵绞痛攫住了大家的心灵。
    晚上，中华人民共和国代表团发出了一个唁电，表达了我们共同的感情。
    一到雅加达，对于亚非会议所面临的问题的实感就开始强烈起来了。从雅加达人民所表现的热情上可以看出这个会议所包含的巨大希望，而从另外一面也可以看出这个会议所必须克服的困难。
    从雅加达的报纸上可以看到，虽然美国并没有参加亚非会议，它却派出了一个最大的“代表团”——由近七十个人组成的记者团，其中有许多人是在这两天才忽然干起记者这一行来的。
    还有别的消息说，美国特务机关还在指使蒋介石在印度尼西亚的恐怖组织“铁血团”和印度尼西亚的武装匪徒勾结，准备在亚非会议期间发动骚扰和暗杀。……等等，等等。
    前途的荆棘确实不少，但是我们都相信：“和平事业决不是卑劣的阴谋所能破坏的”。
    夜已经很深了，早过了十二点了，但是大使馆门前的加渣马达大街上还是站满了人，有中国人，也有印度尼西亚人。
    会议前夕的万隆
    四月十七日　星期日
    早晨六点钟，大家就起来了，今早要到万隆去。
    这样早，然而加渣马达大街上已经聚集了越来越多的人。他们要看一眼或者再看一眼以周恩来总理为首的新中国的代表们。
    同昨天一样，我们的汽车是在人排成的墙当中，在人们的欢呼和掌声当中开到玛腰兰机场的。
    九点三十分，飞机起飞了。沿海的平原慢慢从眼中消失，迎面而来的是一簇簇尖得出奇的山峰，白云像轻纱一样在峰腰飘荡，再下面，一层一层蓄满了水的梯田，宛如镶嵌就的螺钿一样，在热带植物的浓阴下闪闪发光。多么秀丽的山河，多么勤劳的人民呵！
    雅加达灼热的空气渐渐远了，身上渐渐凉爽起来。三十分钟之后飞机降落在万隆的安第机场。这个城市是一个清凉的避暑中心，照中国人的标准看，这里与雅加达气候相差将近一季，如果说后者是盛暑，那末这里就是新秋。
    印度尼西亚共和国的阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理亲自到机场来迎接周恩来总理。
    代表万隆一百二十个团体的“万隆欢迎亚非会议人民委员会”主席阿末向周恩来总理致了颂辞。然后，一位印度尼西亚女郎向周恩来总理戴上了花环，两名华侨女学生献上了鲜花。
    在机场的接待室里，向报界散发了周恩来总理的书面谈话。
    这个书面谈话说：“中华人民共和国代表团抱着对于和平和友好的热烈愿望，前来参加即将在万隆举行的亚非会议。”
    在这个谈话里，周恩来总理也提到了四月十一日的飞机谋杀事件，他说：“我不能不指出有些人是不喜欢我们这个会议的。他们正在力图破坏我们的会议……。但是……我相信，我们的会议一定能够克服各种破坏和阻挠，并对于促进亚非国家之间的友好和合作，对于维护亚非地区和世界的和平作出有价值的贡献。”
    以后发生的事实将会证实上面的预言。
    从机场出来，长长的安第公路两旁站满了万隆的人民，当中国代表团的汽车在呼啸着的军用摩托车引导下从人丛中驶过时，人们忘了一切地鼓掌，欢呼。一路上可以听到用各种语言喊出来的“和平万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”“中国印度尼西亚友好万岁！”有印度尼西亚语，有英语，有潮州话、广州话，以至生硬的北京话。
      一个挤在人背后的年轻的中国母亲，让她的看来不过两岁的女儿坐在自己的肩头上，用力地摇着孩子的胳膊。从她笑着的脸上似乎可以听见她在说：“挥手啊，孩子！这是从我们的祖国来的，他们是我们的亲人。”
    他们中间有许多已经在昨天冒着中午的骄阳和傍晚的骤雨等了一天，因为原来有消息说，中华人民共和国代表团要在昨天到达的。
    独立大厦里的会议还没有开始，里面只有少数的工作人员在忙碌地进行最后的布置工作。然而门前的大街上却已经挤满了人。
    仅仅在几年以前，这座大家所仰望的房子还是荷兰人的夜总会，叫做“刚果第亚大厦”。七十五年以来，能够到这里和对面的属于外国旅馆托辣斯系统的豪曼饭店来的曾经有荷兰殖民主们，日本占领者们，威斯特灵匪徒们，外国的资本家和阴谋家们，而用自己的血汗建造了这所大厦的印度尼西亚的普通人民却进不得门，近不得身。七十五年以来，这里曾经是无数奴役和迫害印度尼西亚人民的阴谋的策源地，是集中了各种淫乱和罪恶的“销金窟”，只有到现在，它才第一次洗净了自己身上的污秽，为印度尼西亚人民，为亚洲非洲和世界和平的利益服务。
      一个多星期以前，由于苏加诺总统的命令，“刚果第亚大厦”命名为独立大厦了，大厦前面的东大街命名为亚非大街了。
    现在，人们聚集在亚非大街上，凝望着独立大厦。从他们兴奋的脸色上就可以看得出他们心底激动的感情。因为这所大厦本身就是殖民主义从猖獗到失败的象征，是殖民地人民从屈辱到独立的象征。
    反对殖民主义，要求民族独立，这是亚非国家和人民的共同愿望，也是亚非会议一个重要的课题。正是因为如此，许多为民族独立而斗争的殖民地人民派遣了他们的代表到万隆来寻求同情和支援。
    傍晚时分，作为观察员来参加亚非会议的突尼斯，摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚三个北非的法国殖民地的代表在豪曼饭店举行了记者招待会。
    会上，突尼斯的优素福和摩洛哥的法席发表了一个声明说：“我们认识到会议决心要消灭任何地方的殖民主义，然而仍旧在殖民统治下生活的我们不能忽视这样的事实：一些殖民国家以及它们的盟国最近一致坚决表示要和我们对抗而形成危险的局势……。北非代表团认为万隆会议是一个有资格的组织来建议，决定适当的措施以结束北非的殖民主义。”
    今天早一些的时候，从南非联邦来的非洲人国民大会代表柯坦和南非印度人大会代表卡查利亚也散发了一个书面声明，要求统治着南非联邦的白种优越论者“放弃不公平的和灾难性的种族隔离和种族歧视政策”。
    马来亚人民的代表也散发了类似的宣言，要求亚非会议帮助马来亚人民摆脱外国殖民主义的统治。
    所有这些都不过是殖民地人民正义的正当的呼声。然而它们引起了殖民主义者的恐惧。
    北非代表团的记者招待会特出地表现了这一点。到这个招待会上来“采访”新闻的帝国主义的
  “记者”们居然对优素福和法席的声明提出“意见”，说这个声明“太过火了”。
    这些“记者”中最有名的一位是美国纽约州的众议员鲍威尔。当法席在答复别的“记者”的挑衅性的问题，说到摩洛哥人民决不承认法国把在摩洛哥的军事基地转让给美国的协定时，鲍威尔的脸色一下变了。“面容失色”——一位路透社记者就是这样形容他的。
    在这次记者招待会之后不久，这位最近才取得了记者身份来参加亚非会议而并不讳言自己是美国政府的观察员的众议员鲍威尔先生就自己举行了一个记者招待会。
    他的全部发言的目的是要掩饰美国的种族主义。不过，鲍威尔先生并没有什么论据来支持自己的谎言，他唯一的法宝是“现身说法”，以自己虽然是黑人而仍然能够飞黄腾达的身世来证明美国对黑人并没有人所共知的那种歧视。
    鲍威尔的招待会不过是一篇“此地无银三十两”的笑话，然而它却提醒人们：有人恐惧反对殖民主义，反对战争的运动，而且他们正在这里积极活动，企图把是非颠倒过来，转移亚非会议反对殖民主义，反对战争的锋芒。
    晚上得到的消息说，所有已经到达万隆的各代表团团长今天下午在印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约的别墅举行了非正式会议，对于会议的议事规则和议程取得了协议。大家都在期望会议在明天顺利召开。
    万隆人民对于亚非会议的欢迎到晚上的火炬游行达到了高潮。大约在七点多钟，三千多个青年人，每五个人排成一排，拿着火把，在亚非大街上的豪曼饭店，普利安格尔饭店和独立大厦前面来回游行。站在大街两旁的群众对他们报以热烈的欢呼。
    对于一个中国人说来，这种情景使人产生类似除夕的感觉。今夜，在许多代表团的房间和别墅里，灯光一直是亮着的。人们今夜将很少睡觉，大家都在紧张地工作着，准备迎接不久就要到来的一个新的历史性的时刻。（待续）
