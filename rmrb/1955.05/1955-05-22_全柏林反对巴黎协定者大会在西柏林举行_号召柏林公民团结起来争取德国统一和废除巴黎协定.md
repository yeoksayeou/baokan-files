Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 21st -- According to TASS, Berlin: Despite the West Berlin authorities' police terror tactics and bans, Berlin patriots held a Pan-Berlin Congress of Opponents of the Paris Agreement in West Berlin on the 19th. More than 800 citizens representing broad sections of the Berlin districts participated in the congress.

　　A member of a West Berlin trade union gave a report. He pointed out the danger of the Paris military agreements and the necessity of abolishing the Paris Agreement. He said: West Berlin residents bear a great responsibility for whether Berlin can become the capital of a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany. When he spoke of the signing of the Austrian State Treaty (formerly translated as the Austrian Peace Treaty), he emphasized that the German people welcome the signing of a German peace treaty according to the example of the Austrian State Treaty.

　　The attendees unanimously passed the "Declaration of the First Pan-Berlin Congress of Opponents of the Paris Agreement." The declaration particularly pointed out that the Paris Agreement should be abolished because it hinders the unification of Germany and Berlin, and thus violates the vital interests of the German people.

　　The declaration expressed support for the Soviet disarmament proposals, because the Soviet proposals point out the path to achieving understanding, peace, and the security of the peoples of Europe.

　　The declaration announced that it would never recognize the decision of the West German Federal Parliament to ratify the Paris Agreement, and advocated the establishment of a West Berlin Democratic Testing Preparatory Committee to investigate the will of the residents.

　　The declaration called on all Berlin citizens who love peace and hope for the peaceful reunification of Germany and Berlin to unite with all those who oppose the Paris Agreement and work together to strive for Germany to become a unified and democratic country and to abolish the Paris Agreement.

    新华社二十一日讯　据塔斯社柏林讯：柏林爱国者不顾西柏林当局的警察恐怖手段和禁令，十九日在西柏林举行了全柏林反对巴黎协定者大会。参加大会的，有代表柏林各区广大阶层的市民八百多人。
    西柏林某工会会员作了报告。他指出巴黎军事协定的危险性和废除巴黎协定的必要性。他说：柏林是否能够成为统一、和平和民主德国的首都，西柏林居民有很大责任。他在谈到签订奥地利国家条约（前译对奥和约）的时候着重指出：德国人民欢迎按照奥地利国家条约的范例来签订对德和约。
    到会者一致通过了“第一次全柏林反对巴黎协定者大会声明书”。声明书特别指出：巴黎协定应当废除，因为它阻碍德国和柏林的统一，也就违背了德国人民的切身利益。
    声明书表示赞成苏联的裁军建议，因为苏联的建议指出了达到谅解、和平和欧洲各国人民的安全的道路。
    声明书宣布永远不承认西德联邦议院关于批准巴黎协定的决定，并且主张成立西柏林民主测验筹备委员会，以便调查居民的意志。
    声明书号召所有爱好和平和希望德国及柏林和平地重新统一的柏林公民同所有反对巴黎协定的人团结起来，共同为争取德国成为统一和民主的国家及废除巴黎协定而奋斗。
