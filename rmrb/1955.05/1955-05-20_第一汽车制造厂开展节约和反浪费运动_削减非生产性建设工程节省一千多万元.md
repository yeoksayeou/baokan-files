Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 19th. The First Automobile Works is deeply engaged in a mass campaign to practice thrift and combat waste. All functional departments and workshops in the factory have put forward plans to practice thrift and oppose waste. The vast majority of employees have exposed various wasteful phenomena within the factory. The revealed facts prove that since the construction of the factory, due to errors in the thinking of cadres such as "key projects are special" and "everything must be large-scale," as well as poor planning and mismanagement, a large amount of state funds have been wasted and stockpiled. For example, the recently inspected stockpiled machinery and equipment alone are worth 1.6 million yuan. The factory's housing project, due to the pursuit of so-called national forms and excessively high living standards, resulted in a significant increase in construction costs, wasting more than 4.5 million yuan. Currently, many functional departments and workshops have identified the main problems of waste in their departments through mass exposure. Some workshops have also summarized typical examples of thrift and established models of saving.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 19th. The First Automobile Works has cut sixteen non-essential non-productive construction projects and cultural welfare facilities from the original factory construction plan, saving the state more than 12.8 million yuan in construction investment and a large amount of equipment expenses.

Among the construction projects cut by the First Automobile Works this time, one category is projects that are completely unrelated to production and purely for factory decoration, such as the sculpture project; the other category is projects that can be replaced by existing buildings, such as the "modern" central kitchen project, which was originally planned to invest more than 700,000 yuan but can be completely replaced by existing buildings without new construction. The learning building and other projects cut this time can utilize the currently non-essential cadre guesthouse or other large quantities of existing buildings.

When the First Automobile Works prepared the factory construction plan in the past, due to the blind pursuit of "modernization" and "large scale," some non-productive construction projects and cultural welfare facilities were built excessively or to excessively high standards. At the end of 1954, when the factory was preparing the 1955 construction plan, under the leadership of the higher authorities, it became aware of this wasteful situation and began to make some reductions. Not long ago, it decided to further reduce unnecessary projects in accordance with the principle of saving.

　　第一汽车制造厂开展节约和反浪费运动
　　削减非生产性建设工程节省一千多万元
    据新华社长春十九日电　第一汽车制造厂正在深入展开群众性的厉行节约，反对浪费的运动。全厂各职能处、各车间都已提出厉行节约、反对浪费的方案，广大职工纷纷揭发了厂内的各种浪费现象。揭发出的事实证明，在建厂以来由于干部中存在“重点工程特殊化”、“处处大规模”等错误思想，以及计划不周、管理不善等原因，曾浪费和积压了国家大量资金。如最近检查出的积压的机器设备就值一百六十万元。这个厂的住宅工程，由于追求所谓民族形式和过高的生活水平，以致建筑造价大大提高，浪费资金四百五十多万元。现在，不少职能处和车间通过群众揭发，找到了本部门浪费方面的主要问题。有的车间并总结了节约方面的典型事例，树立起节约的榜样。
    据新华社长春十九日电第一汽车制造厂从原订建厂计划中削减了十六项不是必需的非生产性建设工程和文化福利设施，为国家节省了一千二百八十多万元的建筑投资，并可节省大量设备费用。
    第一汽车制造厂这次削减的建设项目中，一类是完全和生产无关、纯粹为了厂区装饰的工程。如塑像工程；另一类是可以用现有其他建筑物代替的工程。如这次削减的准备投资七十多万元的“现代化”的总厨房工程，就完全可以利用旧有建筑物代替，不需新建。这次削减的学习大楼等工程，可以利用目前并不是必需的干部招待所或以其他大量旧有建筑物代替。
    第一汽车制造厂在过去编制建厂计划时，由于盲目追求“现代化”和“大规模”，致使一些非生产性的建设工程和文化福利设施建筑过多或者标准过高。一九五四年年底，这个厂在编制一九五五年建设计划时，在上级主管部门的领导下，察觉到这种浪费情况，就开始作了部分削减；不久以前，又决定进一步按照节约原则削减不必要的工程。
