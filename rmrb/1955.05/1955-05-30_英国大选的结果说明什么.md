What Does the Result of the British General Election Show?
　　Tan Wenrui
　　The result of the British parliamentary election is that the Conservative Party has won a majority of seats and will therefore continue in power.
    The Labour Party has failed in this election, with more than 1.5 million fewer votes than in the last election in 1951. But this does not mean a victory for the Conservative Party, which also received more than 300,000 fewer votes. It should be pointed out that the Communist Party of Great Britain candidates, in a very difficult campaign, received nearly 50 percent more votes than in the last general election. The consistent advocacy of the Communist Party of Great Britain for peace, international cooperation and social progress is increasingly becoming an important factor in British political life.
    An important feature of this election was the unusual indifference of voters to the election, with only about 77 percent of eligible voters participating in the vote. This shows that many British people feel that there is nothing worth choosing between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party.
    The main reason for the Labour Party's failure in this election is that it did not, and did not intend to, put forward policies that differed from the Conservative Party on major issues, especially on foreign policy issues that the British people are most concerned about at present. As even the British bourgeois newspapers admit, the average British voter cannot see any significant difference between the platforms and promises of the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. The "Economist" magazine bluntly pointed out that the difference between the Conservative and Labour election programs "is not like the difference between black and white, but like two shades of gray."
    As for the Conservative Party, it mainly relied on a peaceful posture to earn votes. The leaders of the Conservative Party tried their best in the election campaign to express their willingness to strive for negotiated solutions to international disputes and to ease international tensions. They repeatedly claimed that the British government would "carefully study" the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposals, had "agreed to" the five principles of peaceful coexistence, and were "happy to participate in talks at any level," and so on. On the eve of the election, Prime Minister Eden also particularly emphasized that his government had no prejudice on the issue of the location and timing of the Big Four conference, and repeatedly assured that if the Conservative Party continued to govern, it would do its best to promote the holding of a meeting of the heads of the four governments. The leaders of the Conservative Party cannot fail to see the strong desire of the broad masses of the British people to hold Big Power talks and ease international tensions. London newspapers pointed out that the promise to hold Big Power talks was the main trump card for the Conservative Party to win over voters.
    However, the slogan of peace put forward by the British Conservative Party during the election campaign is a far cry from the foreign policy it has pursued during the past three and a half years of its rule. For three and a half years, the Conservative government has been following the U.S.'s "strength" policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war. In the Far East, it supported the U.S. invasion of our country's territory of Taiwan, and helped the U.S. put together the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc; in Europe, it spared no effort to revive West German militarism with the U.S., and advocated the atomic arms race. On the issue of holding Big Power conferences to resolve international disputes, it replaced action with empty talk, and in fact took the same steps as the United States, adopting a policy of obstruction and sabotage of the "policy of strength." It is because of this practice of the British Conservative government that the war policy of the American aggressive bloc has been encouraged. This foreign policy of the Conservative government is resolutely opposed by the British people, but it is supported by the Labour Party on some important issues.
    One cannot fail to note that even when the Conservative leaders were campaigning by promoting their willingness to strive to ease international tensions, they did not stop touting the "policy of strength" and expanding armaments. At the same time, a United Press reporter, commenting on the results of the British general election, revealed Washington's hope that the Conservative government headed by Eden would continue to follow U.S. policy, saying that Eden may "continue to pursue his generally pro-American policy."
    However, the British people have made it clear that they are determined to demand that the new Conservative government follow a policy that is in line with the interests of the British nation and the interests of international peace. Now, the British people are asking what policy the British Conservative government will pursue after this election. Time will tell to what extent the Conservative Party will consider the will of the British people.

### 英国大选的结果说明什么

　　英国大选的结果说明什么
　　谭文瑞
　　英国议会选举的结果，保守党获得了多数的议席，因而将继续当权。
    这次选举的结果，工党是失败了，它所得的票数比一九五一年上次选举少了一百五十多万张。但这并不意味着保守党的胜利，它所得的票数也减少了三十多万张。应该指出，英国共产党候选人在重重困难的竞选中，获得了比上次大选增多将近百分之五十的选票。英国共产党为和平、国际合作和社会进步而提出的一贯主张，越来越成为英国政治生活中的重要因素。
    这次选举的一个重要特点就是选民对于选举异常冷淡，合格的选民只有约百分之七十七参加了投票。这说明了许多英国人民感到，在保守党和工党二者当中，并没有值得选择的。
    工党在这次选举中失败的主要原因，是它没有也不打算提出在重大问题上有别于保守党的政策，特别是在英国人民目前最关心的外交问题上。正如英国资产阶级报纸也承认的，英国的普通选民看不出保守党和工党两党的纲领和诺言有什么重大的不同。“经济学家”杂志就毫不讳言地指出：保守党和工党的竞选纲领之间的差别“不像黑同白的差别，而像深浅不同的两种灰色”。
    至于保守党，它主要是靠了和平的姿态来赚取选票。保守党的领袖们在竞选运动中竭力表示愿意争取协商解决国际争端和缓和国际紧张局势。他们连续声称，英国政府要“仔细地研究”苏联的裁军新建议，已经“同意了”和平共处的五项原则，“乐于参加任何级的会谈”等等。在大选举行的前夕，艾登首相还特别强调说，他的政府对大国会议的地点和会期问题并没有成见，而且一再提出保证，如果保守党继续执政，将尽力促进四国政府首脑会议的举行。保守党的领袖们不能不看到广大英国人民要求举行大国会谈、缓和国际紧张局势的强烈愿望。伦敦的报纸曾经指出，保证举行大国会谈的诺言，是保守党争取选民的主要王牌。
    但是，英国保守党在竞选期间所提出的和平口号是和它在过去执政三年半所执行的外交政策有很大距离的。三年半以来，保守党政府一直是追随美国扩军备战的“实力”政策。在远东，它支持美国侵占我国领土台湾的侵略行动，帮助美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团；在欧洲，它不遗余力地和美国一起复活西德军国主义，鼓吹原子军备竞赛。在举行大国会议解决国际争端的问题上，它以空谈来代替行动，实际上和美国一致步调，采取“实力地位政策”的阻挠和破坏方针。正是因为英国保守党政府的这种作法，使得美国侵略集团的战争政策受到了鼓励。保守党政府的这种外交政策，是英国人民所坚决反对的，却得到工党在一些重要问题上的支持。
    人们不能不注意到，保守党的领袖们就是在竞选中宣传他们愿意争取缓和国际紧张局势的时候，也没有停止鼓吹“实力地位政策”和扩张军备。同时合众社记者在评论英国大选结果时流露出了华盛顿方面希望以艾登为首的保守党政府继续追随美国政策的心情，他说：艾登可能“继续执行他的一般可以说是亲美的政策”。
    但是，英国人民已明白表示他们坚决要求保守党新政府遵循一种符合英国民族利益和国际和平利益的政策。现在，英国人民要问，这次选举后，英国保守党政府将执行什么政策。时间将会表明保守党考虑英国人民的意志到什么样的程度。
