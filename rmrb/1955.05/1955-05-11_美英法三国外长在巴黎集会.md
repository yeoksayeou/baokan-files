　　US, British, and French Foreign Ministers Meet in Paris

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and France began a meeting in Paris on the 7th. In the meetings held on the 7th and 8th, they unilaterally discussed the issue of holding a four-power conference with the Soviet Union, and also discussed the Austrian treaty issue, the situation in South Vietnam, and the situation in the Taiwan area.

British Foreign Secretary Macmillan arrived in Paris on the 7th and immediately held talks with US Secretary of State Dulles. Reuters reported that Macmillan "urged the United States to agree to hold a four-power summit meeting" during the talks. Reuters said that Macmillan specifically chose this time to propose this idea in order to help the British Conservative government "overcome the election difficulties (in the British Parliament) that may prove very difficult." The Associated Press reported that it was learned from talks with responsible US officials that the United States' policy on the four-power conference issue "has not changed" after this meeting. The United States advocated holding a four-power foreign ministers' conference before the four-power summit meeting.

On the 8th, Dulles, Macmillan, and French Foreign Minister Pinay held a meeting and discussed the four-power conference issue again. West German Chancellor and Foreign Minister Adenauer also attended the meeting. Reuters reported that the United States, Britain, and France agreed to hold a four-power conference, but it was still undecided whether to hold a summit meeting or a foreign ministers' meeting. A British spokesman said on the evening of the 8th that Dulles was waiting for Eisenhower to decide whether to agree to the proposal of Britain, which was supported by France.

Dulles and French Prime Minister Faure and Foreign Minister Pinay held a meeting on the 7th to discuss the conflict between South Vietnamese Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem, who reflects US-French contradictions, and Bao Dai and religious factions over the struggle for power. Macmillan also attended the talks. United Press International reported that "there was a sharp divergence" between the United States' attitude of fully supporting Ngo Dinh Diem and France's attitude of advocating maintaining Bao Dai's position and weakening Ngo Dinh Diem's power. The "showdown" talks between the United States and France "did not reach an agreement," and the talks "adjourned without announcing any progress." Dulles, Pinay, and Macmillan also discussed the South Vietnam issue on the 8th.

　　美英法三国外长在巴黎集会
    据新华社讯　美国、英国和法国外交部长七日起在巴黎举行会议。他们在七日和八日举行的会议上片面地讨论了同苏联举行四国会议问题，并且讨论了对奥和约问题、南越局势问题、台湾地区局势问题等。
    英国外交大臣麦克米伦七日到达巴黎后就立即同美国国务卿杜勒斯举行会谈。路透社消息说，麦克米伦在会谈中“催促美国同意召开四大国政府首脑会议”。路透社说，麦克米伦特别挑选这个时候提出这个主张，是为了帮助英国保守党政府“克服可能证明很困难的（英国议会）选举难关”。美联社消息说，从同美国负责官员谈话中得知，在这次会谈后，美国在四国会议问题上的政策“并没有改变”，美国主张在四国政府首脑会议以前先举行四国外长会议。
    八日，杜勒斯、麦克米伦和法国外交部长比内举行会议，又讨论四国会议问题。西德总理兼外交部长阿登纳也参加了会议。路透社消息说，美、英、法三国协议要举行四国会议，但仍未决定是举行政府首脑会议，还是外长会议。英国发言人在八日晚间说，杜勒斯正在等待艾森豪威尔对英国的并得到法国支持的主张作出是否同意的决定。
    杜勒斯和法国总理富尔、外交部长比内在七日举行会议，讨论反映着美法矛盾的南越总理吴庭艳同保大和教派间争夺权利的冲突问题。麦克米伦也参加了会谈。合众社消息说，全力支持吴庭艳的美国态度同主张保留保大地位、削弱吴庭艳权力的法国的态度间“有尖锐的分歧”，美法“摊牌的”会谈“没有达成协议”，会谈“没有宣布有任何进展即告散会”。杜勒斯、比内和麦克米伦八日又讨论了南越问题。
