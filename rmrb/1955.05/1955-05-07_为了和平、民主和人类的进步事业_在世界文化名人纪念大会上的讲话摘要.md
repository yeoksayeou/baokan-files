　　For the Cause of Peace, Democracy, and Human Progress
　　——Excerpts from a Speech at the Commemorative Meeting for World Cultural Figures
　　Mao Dun
    Today we solemnly commemorate four world cultural figures: Schiller, Mickiewicz, Montesquieu, and Andersen.

    We are especially honored today that representatives of the cultural circles from the homelands of these four cultural giants are participating in this commemorative meeting. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese cultural circles, the Chinese people, and myself, to express our highest respect and warmest welcome to the distinguished guests who have come from afar to attend this commemorative meeting!

    Schiller was born in 1759 and died in 1805. His life coincided with the era when the German people were seeking democracy, peace, and unity; his works reflected the spirit of this era.

    This year marks the 150th anniversary of Schiller's death. However, the imperialist aggressive bloc, headed by U.S. imperialism, is creating the Paris Agreement, reviving German militarism, dividing Germany, and preparing for a third world war. The German people are in the same situation as Schiller's time. "Democracy, peace, unity" is their urgent and unanimous cry. The poet's immortal works, his resounding language, will always sound like a marching horn; in the voice of the German people today, we hear the poet's resounding call. This call not only inspires the German people but also inspires all peace-loving people to stride forward!

    In the movement for peace and democracy, the great Polish people's poet Mickiewicz is also inspiring the people of the world to advance shoulder to shoulder. It has been a hundred years since Mickiewicz's death, but his fiery heart of love for his country and love for freedom still beats, beating in the chest of every Polish person.

    As early as nearly fifty years ago, the great Chinese writer Lu Xun introduced the poet's works to China. Since then, the voice of the people emanating from the depths of the poet's heart has also begun to inspire the freedom-craving minds of the Chinese people. Mickiewicz is the people's poet of Poland, but his songs have flown all over the world!

    We commemorate with reverence the bicentennial of the death of Montesquieu, the outstanding French sociologist, historian, and writer of the 18th century. We Chinese people feel close to this great French thinker. Because at the mention of his name, we think of how "The Spirit of the Laws," translated into Chinese fifty years ago, inspired our predecessors to fight to overthrow the autocratic regime of the feudal dynasty, just as "The Spirit of the Laws" inspired the French people in those years.

    Montesquieu's works have played a great role in promoting the cause of human progress. Montesquieu firmly opposed wars of aggression. He said: "Only two kinds of war are just wars: one is the war waged to resist enemy aggression; the other is to rescue allies who have been invaded..." He also said: "Conquest, in itself, does not grant the conqueror any rights... Conquest is a monument to tyranny."

    The contribution of the great Danish children's literature writer Andersen to mankind is something we can never forget. When Andersen is mentioned, each of us will surely think of our childhood, and surely recall how the beautiful and profound works of this great writer nurtured our immature minds.

    Andersen's feelings were consistent with those of the people. He saw that Danish society at that time consisted of the licentiousness and shamelessness of the aristocratic landlords on the one hand, and the impoverished lives of the working people on the other. He recognized the ugliness of the rulers, and he knew even more the beautiful souls of those poor people.

    Andersen warmly placed his hope in the future generation. And his works are indeed loved by children all over the world. He tells children that they should know how to hate exploitation, slaughter, barbarism, greed, vanity, and pride; at the same time, he praises diligence, bravery, the perseverance to overcome difficulties, and the spirit of self-sacrifice. He used the clearest and most determined voice to tell us: the future of mankind is bright, and mankind will surely be able to create a peaceful, happy, free, and beautiful world.

    Dear comrades and friends: Schiller, Mickiewicz, Montesquieu, and Andersen, their cause is for humanity, and the people of the world will forever commemorate their immortal achievements. The peaceful, friendly, free, and happy life they yearned for has already been realized in one-third of human society, and is attracting more and more kind people to strive for its realization. We Chinese people have the highest respect and sincere friendship for the people of Germany, Poland, France, and Denmark who produced such cultural giants.

    为了和平、民主和人类的进步事业
　　——在世界文化名人纪念大会上的讲话摘要
　　茅盾
    今天我们隆重地纪念的四位世界文化名人，就是席勒、密茨凯维支、孟德斯鸠和安徒生。
    今天我们特别感到荣幸的，是这四位文化巨人的祖国的文化界代表们参加了这个纪念会。请允许我代表中国文化界和中国人民以及我自己，对于远道而来参加这个纪念会的贵宾们表示崇高的敬意和热烈的欢迎！
    席勒生在一七五九年，死在一八○五年，他的一生正处于德意志人民寻求民主、和平、统一的时代；他的作品反映了这一时代的精神。
    今年是席勒逝世的一百五十周年纪念。可是，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义侵略集团却正在制造巴黎协定，复活德国军国主义，分裂德国，准备第三次世界大战。德国人民正处于席勒当年的境地。“民主、和平、统一”是他们迫切的一致的呼声。诗人的不朽的著作，响亮的语言，永远像是进军的号角；在今天的德国人民的呼声中，我们听见了诗人的这种响亮的号音。这号音不但鼓舞了德国人民，也鼓舞着所有爱好和平的人民大踏步前进！
    在争取和平、民主的运动中，鼓舞着全世界人民并肩前进的，还有波兰的伟大的人民诗人密茨凯维支。算起来，密茨凯维支逝世已经一百年了，但他那颗火热的爱祖国、爱自由的心，却依旧跳动着，跳动在每个波兰人民的胸膛里。
    早在将近五十年前，中国的伟大作家鲁迅就把诗人的作品介绍到中国来。从那时起，诗人从心深处发出的人民的声音，也开始激励着中国人民的渴望自由的心灵。密茨凯维支是波兰的人民诗人，但全世界都飞遍了他的歌声！
    我们怀着崇敬的心情，纪念十八世纪法国杰出的社会学家、历史学家和作家孟德斯鸠的逝世二百周年。我们中国人民对于这位伟大法国思想家是感到亲切的。因为一提到他的名字，我们就想起了五十年前就已译成中文的“法意”曾经怎样地鼓舞了我们的先辈为了打倒封建王朝的专制政权而斗争，正像“法意”在当年怎样地鼓舞了法兰西人民。
    孟德斯鸠的著作，对于人类的进步事业曾经起过很大的推动作用。孟德斯鸠坚决反对侵略战争。他说：“只有两类战争是正义的战争：一类是为了抗拒敌人侵袭而进行的战争；另一类，为了援救被侵袭的同盟者。……”又说：“征服这行动，本身并不给予征服者任何权利……征服乃是暴政的纪念碑。”
    丹麦的伟大的儿童文学作家安徒生对于人类的贡献，是我们永远不能忘记的。提起了安徒生，我们每个人一定会想起自己的儿童时代，一定要回忆到，这位伟大作家的美丽而深刻的作品怎样哺育了我们的幼稚的心灵。
    安徒生的感情和人民的是一致的。他看见丹麦当时的社会，一方面是贵族大地主的荒淫与无耻，一方面是劳苦人民的饥寒交迫的生活。他认清统治者的丑恶，他更知道那些穷苦的人民有着怎样美丽的灵魂。
    安徒生热烈地把他的希望寄托在未来的一代。而他的作品也确实为全世界的孩子们所爱好的。他告诉孩子们应该懂得去憎恨剥削、残杀、蛮横、贪婪、虚荣和骄傲；同时又向孩子们歌颂勤劳、勇敢，以及克服困难的毅力和自我牺牲的精神。他用了最朗爽而坚定的声音对我们说：人类的未来是光明的，人类一定能够创造出一个和平、幸福、自由、美好的世界。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们：席勒、密茨凯维支、孟德斯鸠和安徒生，他们的事业是为人类的，全世界人民永远纪念着他们的不朽的劳绩。他们所憧憬的和平、友好、自由、幸福的生活，已经在人类社会三分之一的范围内实现了，而且正在吸引着越来越多的善良人民为了它们的实现而奋斗。我们中国人民对于产生了这样的文化巨人的德意志、波兰、法兰西和丹麦的人民，怀有崇高的敬意和诚挚的友谊。
