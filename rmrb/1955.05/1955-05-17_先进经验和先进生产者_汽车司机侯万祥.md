Advanced Experience and Advanced Producers

Automobile Driver Hou Wanxiang

By our correspondent Zhang Shiying

Every day, hundreds of cars run between the various production plants and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, transporting the materials needed for production.

In the past, there was a serious problem in automobile transportation - the amount of oil used by automobiles exceeded the regulations month by month, and transportation costs exceeded the budget month by month. From January to August 1954, the excess consumption exceeded the quota by 89,004 kilograms of gasoline and 54,021 kilograms of diesel, which were worth 92,700 yuan.

Hou Wanxiang, a young automobile driver in the freight transportation section, used to be the one in the team who consumed the most gasoline. In June of last year, he used 392 kilograms more gasoline in one month alone.

Hou Wanxiang's waste of gasoline was criticized by the leadership. He was determined to change this situation and began to find ways to save gasoline.

Initially, he narrowed the width of the oil tank, reducing the flow of oil, which saved some oil. However, the amount saved was still not significant. So he looked for tricks in the operating methods. In the past, he used to drive very willfully, always wanting to drive ahead of other cars, and he would step on the accelerator and drive forward desperately as soon as the engine started. Later, when starting the car, he lightly stepped on the accelerator to slowly increase the speed of the car, avoiding wasting gasoline by slamming on the accelerator. In the past, when encountering roads that were difficult to travel, he would not take them even if they were very close, and would specialize in taking the long, easy-to-travel roads. Later, he appropriately controlled the speed according to the road conditions and made full use of the inertial force to drive. In the past, when loading and unloading goods, he would drive in without looking at the address beforehand, often backing up back and forth, sometimes for more than ten minutes. Later, he would look at the address first and only back up once or twice. And as soon as the car stopped, he would turn off the ignition switch no matter how long it was. In this way, he consumed 135 kilograms less gasoline in August of last year. In September and October, he saved another 554 kilograms.

The leading comrades summarized Hou Wanxiang's experience in saving gasoline and promoted it throughout the team, launching a labor competition to save gasoline. From September last year to March this year, Hou Wanxiang overfulfilled the transportation task by 128.45 percent and saved 1,412 kilograms of gasoline; the entire team overfulfilled the transportation task by 125.75 percent and saved 81,547 kilograms of gasoline and diesel. This completely reversed the abnormal phenomenon of transportation costs exceeding the budget month by month in the past.

Starting in April of this year, Hou Wanxiang proposed a plan to save the state 1,826 kilograms of gasoline on the basis of guaranteeing the overfulfillment of 20 percent of the transportation task and safe transportation throughout the year, and put forward a proposal for conservation to the young workers of the city. The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League immediately supported this initiative and called on the city's young automobile drivers to learn from Hou Wanxiang. It pointed out that if all the drivers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's automobile team could be like Hou Wanxiang, they could save gasoline and diesel worth 488,000 yuan annually. If all the automobile drivers in Anshan City could be like Hou Wanxiang, the value of the gasoline saved each year would reach 2.22 million yuan.

After this call was issued, the city's automobile drivers responded to Hou Wanxiang's proposal. Many groups and individuals in the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's automobile team have also put forward savings plans and guarantees.

    鞍山钢铁公司各个生产厂矿之间，每天都有成百辆的汽车奔驶，运送生产上所需要的物资。
    过去，汽车运输中存在一个严重的问题——汽车的用油量月月超过规定，运输成本月月超支。一九五四年一月到八月，超过消耗定额多用了八万九千零四公斤汽油和五万四千零二十一公斤柴油，这些油价值九万二千七百多元。
    运货工段的青年汽车司机侯万祥，曾是全队消耗汽油最多的一个。去年六月一个月就多用了三百九十二公斤汽油。
    侯万祥浪费汽油的现象受到领导上的批评。他决心要改变这种情况，开始想办法节省汽油。
    最初，他把油槽宽度缩小，减低了油的流量，省了一些油。可是节省的数量还不多。于是他又从操作方法上找窍门。过去自己开车很任性，总想开在其他车的前面，发动机刚一发动就加大油门拚命往前开。以后他在起车时轻踏油门，使车的速度慢慢增加，避免猛轰油门浪费汽油。过去遇到不好走的道路时，那怕很近也不走，专抄好走的远路走，以后根据道路的情况适当地掌握速度，充分利用隋力行驶。过去装卸货时事先不看好地址就开进去，经常来回倒车，有时要十多分钟，以后先看好地址，只倒一两次就行了。并且车一停下不管时间长短就把电门关上。这样，在去年八月份一个月内就少消耗一百三十五公斤汽油。九、十两个月中又节省了五百五十四公斤。
    领导同志总结了侯万祥节省汽油的经验，并在全队推广，展开了节省汽油劳动竞赛。从去年九月到今年三月，侯万祥超额完成了运输任务百分之一百二十八点四五，节省了汽油一千四百一十二公斤；全队超额完成了运输任务百分之一百二十五点七五，节省了汽油和柴油八万一千五百四十七公斤。这样就完全扭转了过去运输成本月月超支的不正常现象。
      从今年四月份起，侯万祥又提出保证在全年超额完成百分之二十的运输任务和安全运输的基础上，给国家节省一千八百二十六公斤汽油的计划，并向全市的青年职工提出了节约的倡议。青年团鞍山市委员会立刻支持了这一倡议，号召全市的青年汽车司机向侯万祥学习。指出如果鞍山钢铁公司汽车大队全体司机都能像侯万祥这样，每年就能节省价值达四十八万八千元的汽油和柴油。如果全鞍山市汽车司机也能像侯万祥那样，那么每年节省的汽油价值将达二百二十二万元。
    这个号召发出后，全市的汽车司机都响应了侯万祥的倡议。鞍钢汽车大队的很多小组和个人也都纷纷提出了节约计划和保证。
