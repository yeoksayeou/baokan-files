Capital Residents Enthusiastically Visit the "Liberate Taiwan Exhibition"

The "Liberate Taiwan Exhibition" held in Beijing, through various pictures, objects, charts, models, and art works, powerfully illustrates that Taiwan has been an inseparable and sacred part of our country since ancient times. It also shows that the United States' seizure of Taiwan and creation of international tension not only prevents our country from smoothly carrying out socialist construction in a peaceful environment, but also threatens peace in Asia and the world. From the exhibition, one can also see that the powerful People's Liberation Army is making great contributions to the liberation of Taiwan, and the people of the whole country are strengthening their work in all aspects, actively supporting the struggle to liberate Taiwan. All this fully expresses the great confidence and strength of the people of the whole country to liberate Taiwan.

All four parts of the exhibition have attracted a large number of people and given them a profound education. After visiting the exhibition, every visitor wrote down their thoughts in the comment book and expressed their determination to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions.

Many historical materials in the exhibition fully demonstrate that Taiwan is Chinese territory. Here, visitors are admiringly viewing the "Zheng Chenggong Recovers Chihkan Picture."

　　　Visitors are viewing a map published in the American "Collier's" magazine and a photograph in "U.S. News & World Report" magazine. This map and photograph clearly show that the spearhead of American aggression is pointing directly at our mainland.

　　The exhibition displays many models of aircraft, tanks, and warships of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, demonstrating to the audience that we have the confidence and strength to liberate Taiwan.

　　首都人民踊跃参观“解放台湾展览会”
    在北京举办的“解放台湾展览会”，通过各种图片、实物、图表、模型和美术作品，有力地说明了台湾自古以来就是我国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，说明了美国窃踞台湾制造国际紧张局势，不仅使我国不能在和平环境中顺利进行社会主义建设，而且还威胁着亚洲和世界的和平。从展览会中还可以看到强大的人民解放军正在为解放台湾作出巨大的贡献，全国人民正从各方面加强工作，积极支援解放台湾的斗争。这一切都充分表达了全国人民一定要解放台湾的巨大信心和力量。
    展览会的四个部分都吸引了广大群众，并给他们以深刻的教育。每一个观众在看完了展览会以后，都纷纷在意见簿上写下自己的感想，并表示要用实际行动来支援解放台湾的斗争。

    展览会中的许多历史材料充分说明台湾是中国的领土。这是观众正以景仰的心情观看“郑成功收复赤嵌图”。
　　　观众正在参观刊登在美国“柯里尔”杂志上的一幅地图和“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志上的一张照片。这幅地图和照片清楚地表明了美国侵略的矛头正指向我国大陆。
　　展览会中陈列着许多中国人民解放军飞机、坦克和军舰的模型，向观众表明了我们有信心有力量一定能够解放台湾。
