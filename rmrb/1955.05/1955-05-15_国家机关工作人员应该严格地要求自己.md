　　State Organ Workers Should Strictly Demand of Themselves
　　Li Yan
    State organ workers should strictly demand of themselves in all aspects. Not only should they be models of diligent and conscientious service to the people in their work, but they should also be models of maintaining a hard-working and simple style in their private lives. If someone believes that since they are entrusted with important responsibilities, they should be special and can use the convenience of their position to strive for undeserved enjoyment in life, then their erroneous thoughts and actions will inevitably be criticized and corrected.
    Party organizations and state organs at all levels must strictly supervise their staff and must not be lenient or accommodating simply because they hold important positions. Otherwise, they will also be subject to criticism and correction.
    Recently, a reader named Zhou Hua criticized Comrade Zuo Ye, Assistant Minister of Agriculture, for bringing a large number of public goods from Hankou to Beijing, even with the consent and approval of relevant authorities. The Central Ministry of Agriculture supported this criticism and seriously dealt with Comrade Zuo Ye's mistake. Comrade Zuo Ye was originally the Deputy Director of the Third Office of the Central South Finance and Economics Committee. When he was transferred to Beijing in December 1954 to take office as Assistant Minister of Agriculture, he heard that the supply of furniture in Beijing was relatively difficult and that it would be more convenient to bring his own. Therefore, he transported 46 pieces of furniture, including an office desk, leather swivel chair, glass wardrobe, rattan sleeping chair, double spring bed, chest of drawers, sofa, and coffee table, as well as a car, to Beijing. Transporting these items required a 30-ton railway car and cost over 1,500 yuan in freight. This obviously erroneous practice was also agreed to by the Wuhan Municipal Real Estate Administration and approved by the Central South Directly Subordinate Organs Materials Handling Committee. Why did Comrade Zuo Ye adopt this method to solve the difficulty of using personal furniture? Isn't this a mood of seeking enjoyment and being unwilling to live a hard life anymore? The state is concentrating all its material and financial resources on building a socialist society. Isn't Comrade Zuo Ye's waste of the state's transportation capacity and funds inconsistent with this spirit? Isn't this practice incompatible with the hard-working and simple style that a Communist Party member should maintain? All of this, Comrade Zuo Ye, as well as the Wuhan Municipal Real Estate Administration and the Central South Directly Subordinate Organs Materials Handling Committee, were not unaware of, nor did they completely fail to consider. So, why did Comrade Zuo Ye do this? Because he felt that he was a fairly senior state organ worker, and it was okay to be a little special. Why did the Wuhan Municipal Real Estate Administration and the Central South Directly Subordinate Organs Materials Handling Committee agree and approve? Because in the eyes of these two organs, Comrade Zuo Ye was a fairly senior state organ worker, and it was only right to take care of him. When someone questioned the comrades of the Wuhan Municipal Real Estate Administration, the answer was so confident: "Leaders can take away whatever they want to take!" If this is considered a principle, where is this principle stipulated? Obviously, for some party organizations and state organs, the meaning of the word "leader" has exceeded the party's principles and the state's system. They do not supervise "leaders" according to the party's principles and the state's system, but in order to "take care" of leaders, they often do not hesitate to violate the party's principles and the state's system.
    Comrade Zuo Ye's erroneous practice, although it went through some "agreement" and "approval," was ultimately wrong. Under the supervision of the masses and the party organization, Comrade Zuo Ye made a self-criticism. In his self-criticism, Comrade Zuo Ye believed that this incident was a great inspiration and education for his own thinking, enabling him to recognize the danger of the growth of bourgeois individualism; in the future, he is determined to strictly demand and train himself in all aspects, and strive to better serve the cause of the Party.
    According to our understanding, among some staff members who were transferred to Beijing after the abolition of the large administrative regions last year, there were also similar erroneous practices as Comrade Zuo Ye. They should also be inspired and educated, and should strictly demand and train themselves in the future. All staff members of party organizations and state organs, all party organizations and state organs should be inspired and educated by this example, strictly demand of themselves, and strictly supervise responsible cadres.

### 国家机关工作人员应该严格地要求自己

　　国家机关工作人员应该严格地要求自己
　　黎言
    国家机关工作人员应该在一切方面都严格地要求自己，不但在工作上成为勤勤恳恳为人民服务的榜样，就是在私人生活上也同样应该是保持艰苦朴素作风的模范。如果有人认为自己既然是负了重要责任，就应该特殊一些，就可以利用自己职位的便利去争取非分的生活享受。那么他的这种错误的想法和作法就必然要受到批评和纠正。
    各级党组织和国家机关，必须严格地监督它的工作人员，绝不能因为他们居于重要职位就宽容一些，迁就一些。否则也一定要受到批评和纠正。
    最近有一个署名周华的读者，对农业部部长助理左叶同志把大批公家的物资从汉口带来北京，并且经过有关机关的同意和批准提出了批评。中央农业部支持了这一批评，严肃地处理了左叶同志的这一错误。左叶同志原是中南财经委员会第三办公室副主任，一九五四年十二月奉调来京就任农业部部长助理时，因为听说北京的家具供应比较困难，不如自己带着方便，于是就把办公桌、皮转椅、玻璃衣橱、藤睡椅、双人棕床、五斗柜、沙发、茶几等四十六件家具，还有小轿车一辆运来北京。为了运输这些东西，包了三十吨的一节车皮，花了一千五百多元的运费。这种显然错误的作法还得到了武汉市房地产管理局的同意和中南直属机关物资处理委员会的批准。左叶同志为什么要采取这种办法解决个人家具使用的困难呢？这不是一种贪图享受不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪吗？国家正在集中全部的物力和财力建设社会主义社会，左叶同志如此浪费国家的运输力和资金，不是不符合于这种精神吗？这种作法不是和一个共产党员应该保持的艰苦朴素作风不相容吗？所有这些，左叶同志以及武汉市房地产管理局、中南直属机关物资处理委员会不是不懂，也不会完全不曾考虑。那么，左叶同志为什么会这样作呢？因为他觉得自己是相当高级的国家机关工作人员，特殊一些没有什么。武汉市房地产管理局和中南直属机关物资处理委员会为什么又会同意和批准呢？因为在这两个机关看来，左叶同志是相当高级的国家机关工作人员，照顾迁就是理所应当。有人向武汉市房地产管理局的同志提出质问时，回答的竟如此理直气壮：“首长们可以带走他们愿意带走的东西！”如果这也算一条原则的话，这条原则在什么地方规定的呢？很显然，对于有些党组织和国家机关，“首长”这两个字的意义已经超过了党的原则和国家的制度。它们不是根据党的原则和国家制度去监督“首长”，而是为了“照顾”首长，常常不惜破坏党的原则和国家制度。
    左叶同志这种错误的作法，虽然经过了什么
  “同意”和“批准”，但这终究是错误的。在群众的检举和党组织的监督下，左叶同志作了检讨。左叶同志在检讨中认为，这件事对他本人的思想是一个很大的启发和教育，使他认识到资产阶级个人主义的思想意识滋长的危险性；今后决心要在各方面严格地要求自己和锻炼自己，更好地为党的事业而奋斗。
    据我们了解，去年大行政区撤销以后调来北京工作的一些工作人员中，类似左叶同志这种错误作法的还有，他们也都应该受到启发和教育，今后应更严格地要求自己和锻炼自己。所有党组织和国家机关的工作人员，所有党的组织和国家机关都应该从这件事例中得到启发和教育，严格地要求自己，严格地监督负责干部。
