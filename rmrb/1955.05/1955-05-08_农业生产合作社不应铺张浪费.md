　　Agricultural Production Cooperatives Should Not Be Extravagant and Wasteful
　　Ku Liuzheng, Wei Jin
　　In 1954, Huanggang Special District of Hubei Province suffered a major flood. Some agricultural production cooperatives experienced reduced production, and the lives of their members became difficult. Under these circumstances, some agricultural production cooperatives blindly carried out completely unnecessary construction, resulting in huge waste, which seriously affected production and the lives of the members.
　　The Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qingshiling Township, Tongzi District, Qichun County, was a key cooperative directly led by the Tongzi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The cooperative had sixteen households (twelve poor peasant households and four middle peasant households). After last year's flood, half of the cooperative's fields had no harvest, and the income of the members decreased. All the members except four households had enough grain to last until the wheat harvest, while the rest were short of grain. Xu Dahong, Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, ignored this difficult situation in the cooperative. Only considering that this cooperative was a flagship in the whole district and would soon be expanded to a large cooperative of sixty households, he proposed to use the materials from the old ancestral hall to build a large auditorium. Chen Zhengming, the Secretary of the CCP Township Branch, and Chen Xinyan, the cooperative's director (Deputy Branch Secretary and Township Head), both agreed with this idea and actively prepared for the construction of the auditorium. At that time, the cooperative had very little cash. Xu Dahong personally approved a loan of 700 yuan from the credit cooperatives of the township and Tongzihe Township as a construction fund. After the work started, the funds were insufficient, and they misappropriated the income from the cooperative's advance sale of surplus grain. After the auditorium was completed, it cost a total of 1,244.54 yuan. The auditorium was very large, with eighteen rooms upstairs and downstairs on both sides for people to live in, and the center could accommodate four to five hundred people for meetings. The Deputy Secretary of the District Committee and the Branch Secretary and Director were naturally very satisfied. However, the cooperative had no money left. Three households of members whose houses had collapsed had no money to repair them, and the cooperative could not help them solve the problem. Some members' work point accounts were not yet paid. At the same time, because most of the members participated in the construction of the auditorium, the late autumn and spring harvest crops were not processed and cultivated well and were not growing well; nineteen mu of wheat were not sown. The members were very dissatisfied. Some members said, "The auditorium is built, but the members have nothing to eat. Let's see what ideas the cadres will come up with for everyone in the future."
　　After the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Daji Township, Xiabahe District, Xishui County, expanded, it spent 700 yuan to build a warehouse. Because of the excessive expenditure and the poor harvest due to the flood, fifteen households of members had nothing to eat at that time, and another nineteen households were short of one or two months of food until the wheat harvest. The members angrily said: It was originally said that the warehouse would be used to store grain, but now there is no grain to store, only air. Member Xiao Dingcai used to be very active in production, but now he is in low spirits and doesn't want to work. The cooperative cadres were afraid of being held responsible for this matter and carried ideological burdens, so they were very passive in their work. When the construction of the warehouse began, the cooperative cadres had mentioned this matter to District Head Zhang Jiefi (who was helping with work in this township), but he only asked, "Are you sure?" and that was it. Later, the Xiabahe District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered this matter, but did not seriously inspect and deal with it.
　　Gong Anbai, the director of the Jianguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chenjiapu Township, Baiguo District, Macheng County, only consulted with a few cooperative cadres after the cooperative expanded and spent 300 yuan to renovate an original ancestral hall into a meeting place with a Western-style gate. Last year, the cooperative suffered a flood, and the main crop, cotton, was severely reduced (more than 10,000 jin of seed cotton were harvested in 1953, but only more than 1,000 jin of seed cotton were harvested in 1954). The income of the members was greatly reduced and they could not afford the huge sum of money spent on building the meeting place; they complained that the director and others were too extravagant and wasteful, and several new members requested to withdraw from the cooperative. Although the Macheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party criticized this matter at an enlarged cadre meeting, it did not seriously help solve the existing problems within the cooperative, and the dissatisfaction of the members has not been reversed.
　　The above three agricultural production cooperatives are all old cooperatives, and some are even key cooperatives directly led by the District Committee. After the flood, local cadres should have actively led these cooperatives to overcome difficulties, defeat disasters, and increase the income of the members, thereby demonstrating the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives and giving play to the exemplary role of the old cooperatives. But they did not do so. On the contrary, disregarding the members' living difficulties, they proposed or allowed these cooperatives to spend large amounts of funds on construction that was completely unnecessary at the moment. Why did they do this? The main reason is that they mistakenly believed that to show the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, they had to show off, be extravagant, and decorate the facade. They thought that doing so could arouse the envy of the surrounding masses and attract them to join agricultural production cooperatives. Obviously, this understanding is completely wrong. Now, the Huanggang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has ordered the Qichun, Xishui, and Macheng County Committees to immediately send people to these three cooperatives to inspect and properly handle existing problems; and instructed the county committees to learn from the lessons of the above three cooperatives, conduct in-depth inspections of the management of each cooperative during the rectification of the cooperative's work, educate cadres to establish the idea of thrift in running cooperatives, and stop all phenomena of extravagance and waste.

　　农业生产合作社不应铺张浪费
　　库流正　维进
    湖北省黄冈专区在一九五四年遭受了大水灾，有些农业生产合作社减产了，社员的生活有困难。在这种情况下，有的农业生产合作社还盲目地进行完全不必要的建设，造成了巨大的浪费，严重影响了生产和社员的生活。
    蕲春县桐梓区青石岭乡星火农业生产合作社，是中共桐梓区委员会直接领导的重点社。全社有十六户（贫农十二户，中农四户）。去年水灾后，这个社有一半田地没有收成，社员收入减少。全社除四户有粮食可以吃到麦收外，其余的社员都缺少粮食。区委副书记许大宏忽视社里这一困难情况，只考虑这个社是全区的旗帜，又将要扩大为六十户的大社，提出要利用旧祠堂的材料修建一个大礼堂。中共乡支部书记陈正明和社长陈新炎（副支部书记、乡长）都赞同这个意见，积极筹建大礼堂。当时社里现金很少，许大宏亲自批准到本乡信用合作社和桐梓河乡信用合作社借款七百元，作为修建基金。动工后，经费不足，他们又挪用了社里预售余粮收入的款子。大礼堂修成后，共用掉了一千二百四十四元五角四分。大礼堂很大，除两边楼上下十八间房子可以住人外，中间可以容纳四、五百人开会。区委副书记和支部书记、社长自然是很满意的。但是社里没有剩下一个钱了。有三户社员房子倒塌了没有钱修理，社都无法帮助解决。有些社员的工分账也没有还。同时，由于大部分社员参加修建大礼堂，晚秋作物和春收作物都没有加工培育，长得很不好，有十九亩小麦没有下种。社员非常不满。有的社员说：“修了大礼堂，社员没得吃，看干部将来给大家出个什么主意。”
    浠水县下巴河区大吉乡光明农业生产合作社扩大以后，花了七百元修建一所仓库。因为开支过大，社里又遭了水灾收成不好，有十五户社员当下就没有吃的，另有十九户社员到收麦时缺一、二个月的口粮。社员们气愤地说：原来说做仓库装谷，现在没谷装，装了气。社员萧定才过去生产很积极，现在情绪低落不想干了。社干部害怕对这件事情要负责任，背上了思想包袱，工作很消极。当开始修建仓库的时候，社干部曾向区长张戒非（他在这个乡帮助工作）提过这件事情，但他仅问了一句
  “你们是否有把握”就了事。后来，中共下巴河区委员会发现这件事情，也没有认真检查、处理。
    麻城县白果区陈家铺乡建国农业生产合作社社长龚安柏，在社扩大后，仅和少数社干部商量了一下，就花三百元把原来的一个祠堂修建成一个有西式门的会场。去年社里遭了水灾，主要农作物棉花已严重减产（一九五三年收籽花一万多斤，一九五四年只收籽花一千多斤），社员的收入大大减少，对修建会场花掉的这笔巨款负担不起；他们埋怨社长等太铺张浪费，有几户新社员要求退社。中共麻城县委对于这件事情虽然在扩大干部会上作了批判，但对社内存在的问题没有认真帮助解决，社员的不满情绪还没有扭转过来。
    以上三个农业生产合作社都是老社，有的还是区委直接领导的重点社。水灾后，当地干部本应该积极领导这些社克服困难，战胜灾害，增加社员收入，从而显示农业生产合作社的优越性，发挥老社的示范作用。但他们没有这样做。相反地，他们不顾社员的生活困难，竟提议或放任这些社花费大量资金，从事目前完全不必要的修建。他们为什么要这样做呢？主要原因，是他们错误地认为要显示农业合作社优越性，就得讲排场、讲阔气，装璜门面。他们以为这样做就可以引起周围群众的羡慕，就能吸引周围群众来参加农业生产合作社。很显然，这种认识是完全错误的。现在，中共黄冈地委已责成蕲春、浠水、麻城县委立即派人到这三个社进行检查和妥善处理现存问题；并且指示各县委吸取上述三个社的教训，在整顿社的工作当中，深入检查各社的经营管理情形，教育干部树立勤俭办社的思想，制止一切铺张浪费的现象发生。
