　　Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 30th: According to the Romanian News Agency, the 17th issue of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" published an editorial entitled "The International Festival of Unity for Working People" celebrating the "May Day" International Labor Day.

　　The editorial pointed out: On every continent and in every country around the world, working people are celebrating May 1st – the international festival of unity for working people, the friendly festival of workers of all countries.

　　The editorial discussed the progress of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries towards socialism and communism. The editorial said: Socialism is increasingly becoming an important part of the lives of hundreds of millions of people in Europe and Asia. The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, the separation of several countries in Europe and Asia from the capitalist system, and the emergence of a socialist system accounting for more than one-third of the world's population are all the most concrete achievements of mankind, filling the hearts of all progressive people with pride.

　　The editorial pointed out: In capitalist countries, the reactionaries are pursuing a policy of preparing for new wars, intensifying their attacks on the democratic rights and freedoms of the working people, but the forces of peace-loving democracy are growing stronger and becoming an irresistible force. Millions of people in Europe and Asia, the Americas and Africa are rising up; they are waging an indomitable struggle for peace and democracy, for the satisfaction of their essential daily needs, and against imperialist enslavement. The constantly expanding national liberation movement is dealing a devastating blow to the imperialist colonial system.

　　The editorial concluded by saying that on the international festival of workers' unity – May Day – progressive men and women of all countries are stepping up their struggle against the threat of a new world war. Just as day inevitably follows night, and just as the earth inevitably awakens in spring, the people of all countries are moving towards their bright future. No force in the world can hinder the natural development of socialism replacing capitalism. The grand road of history has been clearly and definitely laid out. This is the road illuminated by the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. This is the road to communism.

　　劳动人民国际大团结的节日
　　——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”的社论摘要
　　新华社三十日讯　据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特二十九日讯：共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第十七期，发表了题为“劳动人民国际大团结的节日”的社论，庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。
    社论指出：在全世界所有大陆、所有国家中，劳动的人们都在庆祝五月一日——劳动人民国际大团结的节日，所有国家的工人友好的节日。
    社论谈到苏联和各人民民主国家向社会主义和共产主义迈进的情况。社论说：社会主义正在日益成为欧洲和亚洲亿万人民的生活的重要部分。苏联社会主义的胜利，欧亚两洲若干国家脱离资本主义体系和占世界人口三分之一以上的社会主义体系的出现，都是人类最具体的成就，使全体进步人士的心中充满了骄傲。
    社论指出：在资本主义国家中，反动派正在奉行准备新战争的政策，加紧进攻劳动人民的民主权利和自由，但是爱好和平的民主势力正在日益壮大，而成为不可抗拒的力量。欧洲和亚洲，美洲和非洲各国的千百万人民正在行动起来；他们正在进行争取和平和民主，争取满足他们的必需的日常需要和反对帝国主义奴役的不屈不挠的斗争。不断扩展的民族解放运动正在给帝国主义的殖民制度以毁灭性打击。
    社论最后说，在工人团结的国际节日——五一节——的时候，所有国家的进步男女正在加紧进行反对新世界战争的威胁的斗争。像黑夜以后一定有白昼一样，也像大地到了春天必然会苏醒一样，各国人民正在走向他们光明的前途。世界上没有任何力量能够阻挠社会主义代替资本主义的自然发展。历史的大道已经明确而肯定地规定好了。这是马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林学说照耀下的道路。这是通向共产主义的道路。
