　　The People's Daily News: Since the materials of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique were published, the broad masses of readers have expressed great indignation at the counter-revolutionary crimes of Hu Feng and his clique. From the 14th to the 24th of this month, this newspaper has received nearly 800 letters and articles from readers. In recent days, nearly 100 letters and articles have been received daily. These letters and articles come from all over the country, and the people who write them are extremely broad, including workers in machinery, coal mines, and construction, soldiers from the army, navy, and air force, university professors, primary and secondary school teachers, students from universities and middle schools, cadres of government offices, commercial staff in various industries, transportation personnel, bank accountants, housewives, employees of private Chinese pharmacies, urban residents, members of agricultural production cooperatives, rural workers, literary and art workers, and so on. Many of these letters and articles are sent in individual names, many are written jointly by many people, or sent by the entire office or entire unit. Among them are: letters from all actors, performers, stage workers and all staff of the Central Experimental Opera House, letters from all staff of the Modern and Contemporary Chinese History Teaching and Research Section of the History Department of Beijing Normal University, articles signed by all students of Class 2, Grade 1 of the Chinese Language Department of Peking University, and 28 people including Yu Zhengxin of the department, articles from the Russian Classical Literature Research Group of Grade 3 of the Russian Language Department of Peking University, signed letters from Wang Dezhong and 13 other graduate students of the Industrial Enterprise Organization and Planning Teaching and Research Office of Renmin University of China, signed letters from Dai Jing and 5 other accounting workers from Changxindian, Beijing, articles from the Student Union of the Department of Dramatic Literature of the Central Academy of Drama, articles from 126 members of the reader forum of the Tianjin No. 1 Cultural Palace, and so on. The broad masses of people unanimously believe that Hu Feng, under the guise of a "progressive writer" and "Marxist clothing," is engaged in counter-revolutionary activities and is the most insidious fellow. They unanimously believe that the Hu Feng clique is a counter-revolutionary political conspiracy group, and the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is not only a matter for the literary and art circles, but a matter for the people of the whole country.

　　Liu Duo, a young worker at the Jiawang Power Plant of the Xuzhou Power Supply Bureau, said: "Hu Feng is a thorough counter-revolutionary element. He and his clique have been painstakingly carrying out counter-revolutionary activities for the past 20 years, attacking the Party and progressive forces, and shouting loudly not to 'compromise' with the Party. Can we still argue with such a guy? Can we still let him continue to do evil? No, absolutely not!" Li Xingji, a clerk at the private Wanquantang Chinese Pharmacy in Beijing, wrote: "No matter how Hu Feng plays tricks, he can't deceive the eyes of 600 million people. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique cannot escape the giant palm of 600 million people." Gong Peiying, a housewife from No. 27 Shijia Hutong, Dongdan District, Beijing, wrote: "When I saw articles criticizing Hu Feng in the newspaper, I only thought that he was too deeply infected with bourgeois ideological toxins and did not study enough to distinguish his position. It was not until I read the materials revealed by Shu Wu that I realized that he had been consistently and purposefully engaged in counter-revolutionary and anti-people activities. We must raise our vigilance, resolutely strike at this enemy, and eliminate harm for the people!" Li Li, a worker at a car repair shop in Shijiazhuang, wrote:
  "In the past, we only knew that Hu Feng was a famous writer. After reading the materials exposed by Shu Wu, we realized that Hu Feng was a conspirator. We were deceived by Hu Feng. When we saw through his shameful conspiracy, we were really furious. We workers work day and night to build our motherland, but he is secretly undermining our revolutionary cause. This is absolutely not allowed. We must find out the details of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and eliminate this group of poisonous snakes!"

　　Many readers resolutely demanded that Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress be revoked in accordance with the law, that all his positions in the literary and art circles be revoked, and that he be expelled from the Chinese Writers Association. Resolutely demand that the ringleader of the counter-revolutionary clique, Hu Feng, be punished in accordance with the law.

　　广大读者要求彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团
    本报讯　自从胡风反党集团的材料公布以后，广大读者对胡风及其集团反革命的罪恶表示极大的愤慨。自本月十四日至二十四日，本报已收到读者的来信来稿近八百件，近数日每天收到来信来稿近百件。这些信稿是来自全国各地，写信写稿的人极其广泛，包括各地区的各阶层的人，有机械、煤矿、建筑等工人，有海陆空军的战士，有大学教授、中小学教员、大中学校的学生、机关的干部，有各种不同行业的商业工作人员、交通运输人员、银行的会计、家庭妇女，有私营国药店的店员，有城市居民，有农业生产合作社的社员、农村工作者，有文艺工作者等等。这些来信来稿有许多是用个人名义寄来的，有不少是许多人联名写来的，或者是整个机关、整个单位寄来的。其中有：中央实验歌剧院全体演员、演奏员、舞台工作者及剧院全体工作人员的来信、北京师范大学历史系中国近代及现代史教研室全体人员的来信、北京大学中文系语言专业一年级二班全体同学及该系于正心等二十八人签名的来稿、北京大学俄文系三年级俄罗斯古典文学研究小组来稿、中国人民大学工业企业组织与计划教研室研究生王德中等十三人的签名来信、北京长辛店会计工作者戴竞等五人签名的来信、中央戏剧学院戏剧文学系学生会来稿、天津市第一文化宫读者座谈会一百二十六个会员来稿，等等。广大群众一致认为胡风在“进步作家”和“马克思主义外衣”的伪装下，干着反革命的勾当，是最阴险的家伙。他们一致认为胡风集团是个反革命的政治阴谋集团，同胡风反革命集团的斗争，不仅是文艺界的事情，而是全国人民的事情。
    徐州电业局贾汪发电厂青年工人刘铎说：“胡风是个彻头彻尾的反革命分子，他和他的集团，二十年来，处心积虑地进行反革命活动，打击党和进步力量，大喊大叫不要向党‘妥协’，像这样的家伙，我们还能跟他磨牙吗？还能让他继续为非作歹吗？不能，绝对不能！”北京私营万全堂国药店店员李兴基来信说：“胡风再耍花招也骗不过六亿人民的眼睛，胡风反革命集团是逃不出六亿人民的巨掌的。”北京东单区史家胡同二十七号家庭妇女龚佩英来信说：“在报上看到批判胡风的文章，只认为他是染了资产阶级思想毒素太深，学习不够，不能辨明立场。直到看了舒芜揭露的材料，才知道他是一贯有目的地在从事反革命反人民的活动。我们一定要提高警惕，坚决打击这个敌人，为人民除害！”石家庄一个汽车修理厂的工人李力来信说：
  “过去我们只知道胡风是一个有名的文人，读了舒芜揭发的材料，才知道胡风是个阴谋分子，我们原来被胡风欺骗了。当我们看穿他的可耻勾当时，我们真是愤恨极了。我们工人，夜以继日的紧张劳动，建设我们的祖国，而他却暗地里在破坏我们的革命事业，这是决不能容许的，我们一定要弄清胡风反革命集团的底细，清除这群毒蛇！”
    许多读者坚决要求依法撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会的代表资格，撤销他在文艺界的一切职务，开除他出中国作家协会。坚决要求依法惩处反革命集团的头子胡风。
