　　The Photography Art Exhibition Will Tour
    The Photography Art Exhibition, jointly sponsored by People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, People's Pictorial, PLA Pictorial, and the Chinese Artists Association, opened on the 2nd at the Chinese Artists Association Exhibition Hall in Beijing.

    Participating in this exhibition are 272 black and white photographs and 19 color photographs from the organizing units, photography workers from major national newspapers and periodicals, and some amateur photography workers. There are 158 authors represented. The works include various genres such as creative photos, portraits, landscapes, still life photos, and photographic propaganda posters. These works were selected from more than 3,300 submitted entries.

    Most of the exhibited works are reportage documentary photos. These photos directly record the lives and struggles of the Chinese people since the Anti-Japanese War. From these photos, we can see that during the revolutionary war, photography workers faithfully recorded many heroic deeds of the people, both at the front and in the rear. Works such as Li Feng's "The Power of the People," Lei Hua's "Bonfire," Shi Shaohua's "Wild Goose Platoon," Wu Yinxian's "Internationalist Fighter Norman Bethune," and Jiang Bo's "Dawn Bell" have become valuable historical materials and precious photographic art works of our revolution. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, photography workers truthfully reflected the appearance of construction in all aspects of our country, the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and liberate Taiwan, and the new life of the Chinese people.

    Some of the exhibited photos have been widely published in domestic and foreign newspapers and periodicals and are universally welcomed by readers. Examples include Qi Guanshan's "Chairman Mao and Children," Shi Panqi's "Damma Mountain at 4,600 Meters Above Sea Level," Hu Wei's "The Joy of the Old Villager," Wang Chunde's "Volunteer Army Returns Victoriously," Sheng Jirun's "Growing Taller Again," and the original work of the propaganda poster "We Love Peace," which was distributed 2.55 million copies.

    The exhibition is scheduled to close on the 31st. After closing, all works will be transported to Shenyang, Xi'an, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Shanghai and other cities for a touring exhibition. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　摄影艺术展览会将巡回展出
    人民日报、新华通讯社、人民画报社、解放军画报社和中国美术家协会合办的摄影艺术展览会二日在北京中国美术家协会展览馆开幕。
    参加这次展览会的，有各主办单位和全国各主要报刊摄影工作者的作品以及一部分业余摄影工作者的作品共黑白片二百七十二件，彩色片十九件，作者一百五十八人。包括创作照片、人像、风景、静物照片和照片宣传画等各种体裁的照片。这些作品是从应征作品三千三百多件中评选出来的。
    展出的作品大部分是报道性的记实照片。这些照片直接记录了我国人民自抗日战争以来的生活和斗争。从这些照片里，我们可以看到在革命战争时期，摄影工作者在前线和后方，忠实地记录了许多人民的英勇事迹。如李峰的“人民的力量”、雷桦的“篝火”、石少华的“雁翎队”、吴印咸的“国际主义战士白求恩”、江波的“黎明钟声”等作品，已成为我国革命史料和珍贵的摄影艺术作品。中华人民共和国成立以后，摄影工作者真实地反映了我国各方面建设的面貌，反映了抗美援朝、解放台湾的斗争，反映了我国人民新的生活。
    展出的照片还有一部分是已经为国内外报刊广泛刊用受到读者普遍欢迎的照片。如齐观山的“毛主席和少年儿童”、时盘棋的“拔海四六○○公尺的达马拉山上”、胡伟的“老庄员的喜悦”、王纯德的“志愿军胜利归来”、盛继润的“又长高啦”，以及发行二百五十五万份的宣传画“我们热爱和平”的原作。
    展览会预定三十一日闭幕。全部作品在闭幕以后将运往沈阳、西安、武汉、广州、重庆、上海等城市巡回展览。　（据新华社讯）
