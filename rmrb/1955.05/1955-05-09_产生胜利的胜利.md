　　A Victory That Generates Victories
　　Soviet Union　Saslavsky
　　At the end of World War II, when the war situation had already turned around and the trend of Germany's defeat was obvious, a British reactionary magazine declared: "What we need is not just any victory, we need a British victory."
　　The tone of the American imperialist newspapers was also like this. What they needed was not just any victory, but a "American" victory.
　　What kind of victory this was, was already very clear at the time, and it became even clearer in the post-war years. What the British and American imperialists needed was an imperialist victory. They were planning and implementing policies to pursue such a victory. If such a victory had been achieved, then the current world situation would be one in which the United States ruled over almost all the peoples of the earth. What the rulers of the United States saw in their dreams was that the weakened and war-weary Soviet and Chinese peoples were all under the jurisdiction of American financial monopoly capital.
　　The British and American imperialists tried their best to obtain such a victory, a victory that meant a new re-division of the world by imperialism. That is to say, under the beautiful words of fighting for democracy, they actually wanted to carry out an imperialist war to realize the colonial countries' rule over the peoples of all countries. If this were the case, it would be impossible and uninteresting for the people of the world to talk about a great victory, and Victory Day would no longer be a day of celebration for all people, no longer a festival for free and peace-loving countries.
　　The victory over fascist Germany and imperialist Japan ten years ago was neither a British victory nor an American victory. It was actually a victory of democracy over fascism and reactionaries. Its great outcome was not a new re-division of the world by imperialism, but the collapse of imperialism in many countries. Therefore, Victory Day has become a day of celebration and joy for peace-loving people all over the world. Victory Day marks the beginning of a new era in the development of world history.
　　Where is the mistake of the imperialist elements? They still do not want to understand that the world war in which the powerful socialist country of the Soviet Union participated was not an imperialist war. It should be known that the Soviet Union not only participated in World War II, but its participation was decisive. The armed forces of the Soviet Union played a major role in defeating the enemy. When the Soviet red flag fluttered over Germany, over the Reichstag, it signified the victory over German fascism. And this red flag is a symbol of democracy and socialism, a banner of liberation for the people of all countries, and all mankind has seen it.
　　The victory over the most powerful military capitalist country is not simply a victory of one country over another or of one military group over another. This is a victory of a socialist country over a capitalist country. Socialism is more powerful than capitalism. Not long ago, the Soviet people were still one of the most backward nations in Europe, dependent on foreign capital under the torment of tsars, landlords and capitalists. In more than twenty years, they overthrew the tsarist system and capitalism, established a new and much more perfect social and political system, established a socialist country, and took the leading position in Europe.
　　This is something that the people of the world have witnessed. The bourgeois think tanks predicted that the Soviet Union would be defeated, and created the myth of the invincibility of German imperialism in Europe, America and Asia, and worshiped Hitler's "policy of strength"; however, all mankind saw that this most powerful military power in the capitalist world was finally destroyed, and the young socialist country rose from the ashes of war like a beautiful illusion, proving the superiority of the new social system over the decadent feudal-capitalist system.
　　In the eyes of people who have a correct scientific view of human history, this is not an accident or coincidence at all. The great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism has long foreseen and predicted this outcome of the conflict between capitalism and socialism. In the works of Marx and Engels, in the works of Lenin and Stalin, and in the documents of the Communist Party, the inevitability of socialism's victory over capitalism has been theoretically demonstrated, and the path to this victory of world historical significance has been indicated. The day when the Soviet Union defeated fascist Germany was also the day when Marxism-Leninism defeated the utterly corrupt "wisdom" of capitalist thinkers. They felt their failure, but they did not want to understand how this failure happened. They are now afraid to understand this, because it would mean admitting the victory of socialism and the failure of capitalism. In their mad resentment and frenzy for revenge, they still vainly imagine that they can "reverse the situation," at least to return the world to the situation they were in before World War II. They are trying to revive the old Germany from the fascist ruins. They are trying to make the Chinese people subject to their jurisdiction again. This idea is as absurd and ridiculous as asking a thirty-year-old man to wear three-year-old shorts. Even among the imperialists, there are some who understand that this is unrealistic, and no amount of boasting about "strength" can help. The process of the decline of the old social system and the growth of the new social system is irreversible.
　　The participation of the powerful Soviet Socialist country in the war made World War II a new type of war, one that had never existed in human history. This was a war of liberation. And its victory was also a new victory that had never existed before. This is a victory with far-reaching implications, a victory that does not end in a day or even a year. This is a continuous victory, a victory that generates new victories, a creative victory that constantly creates a new world and new relationships.
　　The imperialists have never wanted to understand this either. Ten years ago, on Victory Day, the American imperialists were still in China. At that time, they planned to settle down in China as if they were in their own home. They believed that the Kuomintang was the main force in China, and if Chiang Kai-shek was given an American boost, he could be turned into a real person. They looked down on the new social forces in China, looked down on the People's Liberation Army, and looked down on the Communists, because they looked at the workers and peasants as shamelessly as colonialists looked at their slaves.
　　But it is precisely the workers and peasants who are the real masters of the new China, and the Communist Party is their true leader. The victory of socialism over capitalism has powerfully promoted the national liberation movement in various countries of the world, especially in Asia. The revolutionary movement against imperialism, which became particularly powerful after the Great October Socialist Revolution, has now flourished immediately after the new victory of the Soviet people. The heroic struggle of the Soviet people for their freedom and independence has become a historically significant school for all people oppressed by imperialism. People everywhere have not only begun to rise up against foreign colonialists, but also against their own traitorous bourgeoisie and against the servants of foreign imperialism.
　　The victory of the Soviet Union has generated a series of victories for the people of Eastern Europe, where socialist countries have been born on the ruins of capitalism. The victory of the Soviet Union generated the great, world-historically significant victory of the Chinese people over domestic and foreign oppressors. In the shortest time—a moment in the historical clock—Chiang Kai-shek became a bubble. He lives poorly and sadly on the island of Taiwan that he seized, along with those clumsy American politicians and generals who bet on this defeated old sick man.
　　Liberated China has risen like a giant from the ruins of feudalism, capitalism and foreign imperialism; it stands on the entire Asian continent, pointing out the road to liberation to the people of Asian countries, and has given ten billion people an unbreakable confidence in the victory of democracy and socialism.
　　And this great victory itself has generated the victories of the Korean and Vietnamese people.
　　The victory over reactionary forces was not only won ten years ago, this victory is continuing. It is constantly changing the face of the world, and bringing new failures one after another to the world of imperialist greed, violence and aggression. The arrogant American imperialists were still shouting yesterday that the United States would carry out aggression, launch a war to make "Asians fight Asians," and organize imperialist groups on Asian soil. But today, the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung has dealt a head-on blow to these dreams of imperialism. The United States wanted to isolate the People's Republic of China—but it itself was isolated.
　　The creativity of the great victory of May 9, 1945 is endless. The sound of gunfire stopped, and the world was filled with another kind of sound. The decaying walls of the old social system crackled; the construction site of the new social system emitted brave and calm sounds of axes. Among the quarreling neighbors of the imperialist group are mutual abuse, hysterical shouting and threats, while among the brothers and friends of the new socialist world are unity, peace and friendship.
　　The old is disintegrating, and the new is growing. If those who are destined to perish dare to extend an armed hand to the new, young, and vital, then the shameful end of capitalism will come faster than its supporters can imagine.

### 产生胜利的胜利

　　产生胜利的胜利
　　苏联　萨斯拉夫斯基
    在第二次世界大战末期，当战局已经扭转，而德国失败的趋势已经很明显的时候，一个英国的反动杂志宣称：“我们需要的不是随便一种什么胜利，我们需要的是英国的胜利。”
    美帝国主义者的报刊的论调也是这样。他们需要的不是随便一种什么胜利，而是“美国的”胜利。
    这是一种什么样的胜利，当时就已很清楚，而在战后年间变得更加清楚了。英美帝国主义者需要的是帝国主义者的胜利。他们所策划和实行的正是追求这样的胜利的政策。如果这样的胜利实现了，那末，现在世界的局面，就会是美国统治着几乎全地球上的各国人民。美国的统治者在梦幻里所看到的是：衰弱的和因战争而疲惫不堪的苏联和中国人民都处在美国金融垄断资本的管辖之下。
    英美帝国主义者极力想获得这样的胜利，获得这种意味着帝国主义新的重新瓜分世界的胜利。这就是说，他们在为争取民主而斗争的漂亮言词掩饰下，实际上是想进行实现殖民国家对各国人民统治的帝国主义战争。如果是这种情况，世界各国人民就会没有可能、也没有兴致来谈到伟大的胜利了，胜利日也就不再是全体人民欢庆的日子，不再是自由的、爱好和平的各国人民的节日了。
    十年以前所取得的对法西斯德国和帝国主义日本的胜利，既不是英国的胜利，也不是美国的胜利。它实际上是民主战胜法西斯主义和反动派的胜利。它的伟大结局不是帝国主义新的重新瓜分世界，而是帝国主义在许多国家的崩溃。因此，胜利日已成为全世界爱好和平的人民的节庆和欢乐的日子。胜利日标志着世界历史发展的新时代的开始。
    帝国主义分子的错误在哪里呢？他们直到现在还不愿意理解，有强大的社会主义国家苏联所参加的世界大战并不是帝国主义战争。要知道，苏联不只是参加了第二次世界大战，而且它的参加是有决定意义的。苏联的武装力量在战胜敌人中起了主要的作用。当苏联的红旗飘扬在德国的上空，飘扬在国会大厦上空的时候，就表明了对德国法西斯的胜利。而这个红旗是民主和社会主义的象征，是各国人民解放的旗帜，全人类都看到了它。
    战胜最强大的军事资本主义国家的胜利，不单纯是一个国家战胜另一个国家或是一个军事集团战胜另一个军事集团。这是社会主义国家战胜资本主义国家的胜利。社会主义是比资本主义更强大的。苏联人民在不很久以前还是欧洲一个最落后的民族，在沙皇、地主和资本家的折磨下依附于外国资本。在二十多年之间，他们推翻了沙皇制度和资本主义，建立了新的、完美得多的社会和政治制度，建立了社会主义国家，并走上欧洲的首位。
    这是全世界人民有目共睹的事情。资产阶级的智囊预言苏联必会遭到失败，并在欧洲、美洲和亚洲制造了德国帝国主义不可战胜的神话，崇拜希特勒的“实力地位政策”；可是，全人类都看到，资本主义世界的这个最有力的军事强国终于毁灭了，而年轻的社会主义国家却像美丽的幻象一样从战火的余烬中站起来了，证明了新社会制度对腐朽的封建—资本主义制度的优越性。
    在对人类历史具有正确的科学观点的人们看来，这完全不是什么意外和偶然的事。伟大的马克思列宁主义学说早已预见到并预言了资本主义和社会主义之间冲突的这种结局。在马克思、恩格斯的著作中，在列宁、斯大林的著作和共产党的文件中，都从理论上论证了社会主义战胜资本主义的必然性，并为这个具有世界历史意义的胜利指示了道路。苏联战胜法西斯德国的日子也就是马克思列宁主义战胜资本主义思想家腐朽透顶的“智慧”的日子。他们感到了自己的失败，但是却不想了解这个失败是怎样发生的。他们现在也害怕了解到这一点，因为这就会意味着承认了社会主义的胜利和资本主义的失败。他们在疯狂的忿恨和复仇的狂热中，还妄想他们能够“扭转局势”，至少使世界回到他们在第二次世界大战以前所处的那种局面。他们企图使旧的德国从法西斯的废墟中复活。他们企图使中国人民再受他们的管辖。这种想法是这样的荒谬可笑，就像要一个三十岁的男子汉穿上三岁小孩的短裤一样。甚至在帝国主义者中间也有一些人明白这是不现实的，任何大吹大擂的“实力地位”广告也无济于事。旧社会制度衰亡和新社会制度生长的过程是不可改变的。
    强大的苏维埃社会主义国家的参战，使第二次世界大战成为一种新型的、人类历史上从未有过的战争。这是解放战争。而它的胜利也是从未有过的新胜利。这是影响极其深远的胜利，这个胜利不是在一天甚至一年中结束的。这是继续不断的胜利，是产生新胜利的胜利，是不断创造新世界、新关系的创造性的胜利。
    帝国主义者也从来不愿意了解这一点。十年以前的胜利日，美国帝国主义者还留在中国。那时，他们打算像在自己家里一样安居在中国。他们认为，国民党是中国的主要力量，如果给蒋介石打上了美国气，就能把他变成一个真正的人物。他们看不起中国的新的社会力量，看不起人民解放军，看不起共产党人，因为他们像殖民者看待自己的奴隶那样无耻地看待工人和农民。
    但是，正是工人和农民才是新中国的真正主人，而共产党则是他们的真正领导者。社会主义对资本主义的胜利，极其有力地推动了世界各国、特别是亚洲国家的民族解放运动。在伟大十月社会主义革命以后变得特别有力的反对帝国主义的革命运动，现在在苏联人民的新胜利之后，立刻蓬勃地发展起来了。苏联人民争取自己的自由和独立的英勇斗争，已成为一切受帝国主义压迫的人民的富有历史意义的学校。各地人民不仅开始奋起反对外国殖民者，而且也反对本国卖国的资产阶级，反对外国帝国主义的奴仆。
    苏联的胜利产生了东欧各国人民的一系列的胜利，那里，在资本主义的废墟上诞生了社会主义的国家。苏联的胜利产生了中国人民战胜国内外压迫者的伟大的、具有世界历史意义的胜利。在最短的时间内——历史时钟的一瞬间——蒋介石就成了一个气泡。他寒酸地、愁苦地栖居在所窃踞的台湾岛上，同他一起的则是那些笨拙的美国政客和将军们，他们把赌注放在这个被打垮了的老病夫身上。
    解放了的中国像巨人一样从封建主义、资本主义和外国帝国主义的废墟中站起来了；它站在整个亚洲大陆上，向亚洲各国人民指出了争取解放的道路，并使十亿人对民主和社会主义的胜利产生了牢不可破的信心。
    而这个伟大的胜利本身又产生了朝鲜和越南人民的胜利。
    不仅是在十年前赢得了对反动势力的胜利，这个胜利还在继续着。它不断地改变着世界的面貌，并为帝国主义的贪婪、强暴和侵略的世界，带来了
  一次又一次新的失败。狂妄的美帝国主义者昨天还在叫喊，美国将要进行侵略，要发动使“亚洲人打亚洲人”的战争，并在亚洲本土上组织帝国主义的集团。而今天，在万隆举行的亚非国家会议就给了帝国主义的这些梦想以迎头痛击。美国想孤立中华人民共和国——但自己却遭到了孤立。
    一九四五年五月九日的伟大胜利的创造力是无穷无尽的。炮声停了，世界又充满了另外一种声音。旧社会制度的腐朽的墙垣发出爆裂声；新社会制度的建筑工地发出了勇敢的和沉着的斧声。在帝国主义集团的争吵着的邻居之间是互相谩骂、歇斯底里的叫喊和威吓，而在新的社会主义世界的兄弟朋友之间则是团结、和平和友谊。
    旧的在瓦解，新的在成长。如果那些注定灭亡的胆敢向新的、年轻的、富有生活力的伸出武装的手，那末，资本主义的可耻的结局，将要比它的拥护者们所能够想像到的来得更快。
