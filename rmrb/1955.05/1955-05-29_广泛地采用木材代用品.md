    Editor's Note: Readers Zhu Jintang and Yang Guanyin's suggestions are correct. It is understood that the Ministry of Textile Industry and the Ministry of Commerce jointly issued a notice in 1954 to implement the method of packaging in mixed batches and mixed pieces; however, it was later temporarily suspended because the China National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation system did not have enough time to prepare. We believe that implementing the mixed batch and mixed piece method to reduce odd pieces of cloth is of great significance for textile enterprises to save resources. We hope that the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, and the China National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation will quickly resolve the difficulties in implementing the mixed batch and mixed piece method and promote this method as soon as possible.
　  Widespread Use of Wood Substitutes
    To the Editor:
    We recently examined the erroneous thinking of construction units regarding the waste of materials. We recognize that, considering national resources and the overall national construction, wood (especially fine materials of red and white pine) is an indispensable and important material in socialist construction. Therefore, how to use valuable wood for key projects or major projects, and to minimize the consumption of wood in secondary projects, should be an important task for the materials departments. In order to save wood, our company has already replaced red pine wood floors with magnesite and sawdust mixtures in the dormitory project we contracted. This improvement saves the country 800 cubic meters of wood. We think that if the entire standard design is improved according to our method, it will save the country a large amount of wood. We suggest that the Ministry of Building Construction and relevant departments widely adopt wood substitutes.

    编者按：读者朱金汤、杨贯荫的建议是正确的。据了解，纺织工业部和商业部在一九五四年曾联合通知各地实行拼匹和拼件包装办法；后来因为花纱布公司系统来不及做准备工作，又暂缓实行了。我们认为，实行拼匹拼件办法，减少零布，对纺织企业的节约有很大意义。希望纺织工业部、商业部和中国花纱布公司迅速解决实行拼匹拼件办法中的困难，及早推行这个办法。
　  广泛地采用木材代用品编辑同志：
    我们最近检查了施工单位浪费材料的错误思想。我们认识到，根据国家资源以及从整个国家建设来考虑，木材（尤其是红白松细料）在社会主义建设中是不可缺少的重要物资。因此如何把贵重木材用到重点工程或主要工程上去，并尽量减少次要工程的木材消耗，应该是材料部门的重要任务。为了节约木材，我们公司承包的宿舍工程，已经改用菱苦土和锯末子配制代替红松木地板。这项改进，给国家节约了八百立方公尺木材。我们想，如果整个标准设计都照我们的办法改进，就能给国家节约大量木材。我们建议建筑工程部和有关部门广泛采用木材代用品。
