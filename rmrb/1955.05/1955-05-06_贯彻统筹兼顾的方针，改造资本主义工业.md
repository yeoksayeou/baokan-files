Implementing the Policy of Overall Consideration and All-Round Arrangement, Transforming Capitalist Industry

In our country, capitalist industry still accounts for a significant proportion of the national industrial production. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, capitalist industry has played a positive role in developing production and ensuring supply, which is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, capitalist production and management are aimed at pursuing profits. Profit-seeking capitalism will inevitably damage the national economy. Therefore, we must utilize the positive role of capitalist industry that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, restrict its negative role that is detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and carry out socialist transformation on them. In recent years, due to the state's policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist industry, the main part of capitalist industry has been brought into the orbit of state capitalism. The intermediate form of state capitalism—processing and ordering—has accounted for the vast majority of private industrial production in major cities; the advanced form of state capitalism—joint state-private ownership—has also been expanding in a step-by-step and planned manner throughout the country since last year.

The socialist transformation of capitalist industry is an extremely arduous task. First of all, attention must be paid to its production arrangement, because appropriate production arrangement is a necessary condition for socialist transformation. To carry out production arrangement, it is necessary to have an overall plan for various types of industries. That is to say, it is necessary to base on the Party and the State's general task of developing socialist and semi-socialist industries in a planned way during the transition period, and implement the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry. For the central state-owned, local state-owned, cooperative-operated, joint state-private owned and private industries (and in many respects also including handicrafts), adopt the policy of overall consideration and all-round arrangement under the condition of ensuring the continuous growth of socialist components. Under this policy, rational arrangements should be made, which should be both different and, in some respects, treated equally. We must oppose the blind development of capitalism and gradually bring it into the orbit of the state plan.

Why must various economic types of industries be planned and arranged reasonably under the policy of overall consideration and all-round arrangement? Because our country in the current stage is a country where five economic components coexist. These different types of economies are not isolated, but affect and relate to each other. If we arrange state-owned industry in isolation and put private industry out of sight, private industry will develop blindly, or encounter difficulties because it does not receive state support. The blind development of capitalist industry will disrupt the state-owned industry's plan in terms of raw material supply and finished product sales. Wouldn't the state-owned industry's plan be damaged by this? If there is planning for some parts but no planning for the overall situation, then this partial plan cannot be unaffected. As for the difficulties of some capitalist industries, they will also affect the development of the national economy and increase the burden on the state. Carrying out overall planning and rational arrangement for various economic types of industries can not only restrict the blindness of capitalist production, but also ensure the completion of the state's overall plan, and enable state-owned industry, cooperative-operated industry, and joint state-private owned industry to develop smoothly and in a planned way.

Why should the principle of both being different and being treated equally in some aspects be implemented when planning the production of various economic types of industries? Because state-owned industry is a socialist, all-people-owned industry, while private industry is a capitalist-owned industry. State-owned and private industries must be treated differently; otherwise, mistakes will inevitably be made. However, under the premise of being different, it is necessary to be treated equally in some aspects, because in the transition period, private industry is also a component part of the national economy. After socialist transformation, the capitalist ownership of enterprises will be replaced by socialist, all-people ownership. At the same time, the workers of private industry and the workers of state-owned industry are both the Chinese working class. We must not divide the unified working class into two parts because of the different nature of the enterprises. Therefore, the arrangement and care for private industry is necessary both from the perspective of the requirements of socialist transformation and from the perspective of the fundamental and current interests of the working class.

It is very obvious from the perspective of necessity that the production of various economic types of industries should be arranged uniformly, but can it be done? Is there such a possibility? Facts have proved that this possibility does exist. In our country, which is in a transitional period, the socialist state-owned economy is the leading component in the national economy, and its proportion in the national economy is constantly increasing. Due to the progress of the state's socialist industrialization, the fact that the main industrial raw materials have been controlled by the state, the gradual expansion of the scope of state control of materials, the fact that the wholesale links in the domestic market and foreign trade are also controlled by the state, and the steady progress of the work of national economic planning—all of this has strengthened the leading role of the state-owned economy in the national economy, and enabled us to carry out unified arrangements in industrial production.

Now, various localities have been carrying out and are carrying out unified arrangements for various types of industrial production under the principle of overall consideration. In order to implement the state's policy of overall consideration and all-round arrangement, we must pay attention to the following issues:

First, in order to maintain the production of some private industries that have encountered serious difficulties, state-owned industries should take care of private industries under necessary and possible conditions, so that they can maintain production. That is, when allocating raw materials and production tasks, the state-owned economy should give appropriate arrangements to joint state-private owned and private industries. For some industries that the state does not operate or operates very little, the competent departments should make overall arrangements between public and private, and between regions. It is wrong to forget the difference and forget to ensure the continuous growth of socialist components when arranging production; at the same time, it is also wrong to only see the state-owned economy and forget the private economy, or only take care of large factories with larger scales and not take care of small and medium-sized factories with smaller scales. We must correct these incorrect views, and we must appropriately arrange the production of private industry so that our socialist transformation work can be carried out smoothly.

Second, appropriately arranging the production of private industry is an important task today. But the arrangement and maintenance of private industry is not to maintain the capitalist mode of production forever, but to prepare favorable conditions for socialist transformation. Therefore, the unified arrangement of private industry must be combined with production reorganization. Those that can be jointly operated with the state should be jointly operated; those that need to prepare conditions and need to reorganize production should adopt the method of large factories leading small factories and advanced factories leading backward factories, to carry out factory mergers and production reorganization, and combine this reorganization work with joint operation work; those that need and can move factories should be helped to move factories, and then carry out joint state-private ownership at an appropriate time. As for a very small number of enterprises that are too backward or even harmful, and have no transformation conditions, they can plan and step by step arrange their personnel, eliminate their enterprises, and encourage and guide them to invest their funds in undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

Third, in order to make unified arrangements for various types of industrial production, it is necessary to rationally utilize existing industrial equipment and control new construction and expansion projects. This should be especially emphasized in the light industry aspect. At present, the utilization rate of equipment in many light industries is very low. If it is not used rationally, and new factories are built and expanded in other regions, it is clearly superfluous and wasteful from the perspective of the state. Therefore, the investment of local industries in various regions must take into account the situation of state-owned industries in other regions; the expansion of private industries must also be managed and controlled. Some industries that are currently experiencing difficulties in product sales, such as pharmaceuticals, gold pens, stationery, printing, knitting, etc., are mostly caused by blind development in the past few years. We must learn from this lesson: without proper control and management of production development, it will blindly increase production, which will lead to overproduction and become difficult.

Fourth, we must advocate the improvement of technology for private industry. Those with backward technology in private industry must be urged to transform; harmful products (such as bad medicine) must be eliminated. At present, there are many capitalists who do not strive to improve management and improve technology, but only want the state to take on their burdens, and want the state to purchase, order, and process for them. This is wrong. There are also some local industries that do not strive to improve technology and improve quality, but use the method of restricting the goods of high quality from other places to protect the market for local products of inferior quality. This is also wrong. All our measures should enable the advanced to continuously improve and the backward to catch up with the advanced. Only in this way can our country's industrial technology and product quality continue to improve. Of course, the advanced and backward mentioned here only refer to production technology and the quality and specifications of commodities, not the economic type. If we confuse the advanced and backward in production technology with the advanced and backward in production relations (i.e., the advanced socialist production relations and the backward capitalist production relations), it will hinder our work of unified arrangement of various types of industrial production.

Fifth, production arrangement is mainly carried out through the method of processing and ordering. In order to ensure the smooth progress of production arrangement, it is necessary to reduce the blindness of processing and ordering, strengthen planning and organization, and make the production plan in the industrial sector as little change, small change, and step-by-step change as possible, so as not to affect production too much. This requires close cooperation between the industrial and commercial sectors. At present, the industrial and commercial sectors in some cities are still somewhat disconnected in terms of processing and ordering, which must be corrected.

Sixth, the unified arrangement of production and the adjustment of public-private relations are closely integrated. In order to make reasonable arrangements for public and private production, it is necessary to use various social forces. Here, the trade union organization is very important. We must rely on the trade union organization and the masses of workers to do a good job in production arrangement and to improve production; secondly, the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Chamber of Commerce are also organizations worthy of attention. In arranging production, some places have made our work more appropriate because they are good at using the strength of this organization; some places have encountered some unnecessary resistance in our work because they have not played its role. This is worthy of our attention.

Seventh, in order to carry out unified arrangement and industry-based transformation, it is necessary to conduct industry-based investigation and research on private industry, to find out its equipment, products, output, raw material needs, and production conditions, so as to formulate industry-based production plans based on the needs of national construction and the people, and on the basis of balance between production, supply, and sales, in order to lay the foundation for socialist transformation by industry. Many industries cannot be investigated clearly all at once, and need to be carried out step by step in a planned way.

In order to implement the state's policy of overall consideration and all-round arrangement for industrial production, the relevant departments of the central government, especially the business departments and administrative departments related to private industry, the Party committees and people's committees of various localities must attach importance to this work, strengthen leadership in this area, strengthen inspection and supervision of this work, grasp the situation in a timely manner, and study and deal with new problems that arise in the process of unified production arrangement in a timely manner. Only by strengthening the leadership of unified industrial production arrangement, and only by implementing the policy of overall consideration and all-round arrangement for industrial production, can the state's policy of socialist transformation of capitalist industry proceed smoothly.

### 贯彻统筹兼顾的方针，改造资本主义工业

　　贯彻统筹兼顾的方针，改造资本主义工业
    我国的资本主义工业，在目前国家工业生产中还占有不小的比重。在国营经济领导下，资本主义工业在发展生产、保证供应方面，发生了一些有益于国计民生的积极作用。但是资本主义的生产经营是以追求利润为目的的。唯利是图的资本主义对于国民经济也必然发生破坏作用。因此，我们对于资本主义工业必须利用其有益于国计民生的积极作用，限制其不利于国计民生的消极作用，并对它们进行社会主义改造。这几年，由于国家对资本主义工业实行了利用、限制和改造的政策，资本主义工业的主要部分已纳入国家资本主义的轨道。中级形式的国家资本主义——加工订货，已占了各大城市私营工业生产的绝大部分；高级形式的国家资本主义——公私合营，从去年起也在全国范围内有步骤、有计划地扩展着。
    对资本主义工业进行社会主义改造是一项极其繁重的工作，首先必须注意到它的生产安排，因为生产的适当安排是社会主义改造的必要条件。要进行生产安排，就必须把各种类型的工业通盘打算。这就是说，必须根据党和国家在过渡时期有计划地发展社会主义、半社会主义工业，执行利用、限制、改造资本主义工业的总任务。对于中央国营、地方国营、合作社营、公私合营和私营的工业（在许多方面还要包括手工业），在保证社会主义成分不断地增长的条件下，采取统筹兼顾的方针。在这个方针下，进行合理安排，既要有所不同，又要在一些方面一视同仁，反对资本主义的盲目发展，把它逐步地纳入国家计划的轨道。
    对于各种经济类型的工业，为什么必须在统筹兼顾的方针下，进行全盘计划合理安排呢？因为现阶段的我国，是五种经济同时并存的国家。这些不同类型的经济，不是孤立隔离，而是互相影响、互相关联的。如果我们孤立地去安排国营工业，把私营工业放在视线以外，私营工业就会盲目地发展起来，或者因为得不到国家的扶助而发生困难。资本主义工业的盲目发展就会在原料供应和成品推销上，打乱了国营工业的计划。这么一来，国营工业的计划，不是要受到损害吗？部分有计划而全局没有计划，则这个局部的计划，是没法不受影响的。至于某些资本主义工业的困难，目前也会影响国民经济的发展，增加国家的负担。对于各种经济类型的工业，进行全盘计划，合理安排，不仅能够限制资本主义生产的盲目性，而且能够保证国家全面计划的完成，能够使国营工业、合作社营工业和公私合营工业得到顺利的、有计划的发展。
    为什么在全盘安排各种经济类型的工业生产时，要贯彻既要有所不同，又要在一些方面一视同仁的原则呢？因为国营工业是全民所有制的工业，而私营工业则是资本家所有制的工业，对待国营工业和私营工业，必须有所不同，否则，就一定会犯错误。但在有所不同的前提下，需要在一些方面一视同仁，因为在过渡时期中，私营工业也是国民经济的一个构成部分，经过社会主义改造之后，企业的资本家所有制，就会被全民所有制所代替。同时，私营工业的工人和国营工业的工人，都是中国的工人阶级，我们断不能因为企业的性质不同，就把统一的工人阶级分裂为两部分。因此，对于私营工业的安排和照顾，不论从社会主义改造的要求来看，从工人阶级的根本利益和目前利益来看，都是必要的。
    对各种经济类型的工业，在生产上进行统一安排，从必要性来说，那是很明显的，但是能不能办到呢？有没有这种可能性呢？事实证明，这种可能性是也存在着的。处在过渡时期的我国，社会主义的国营经济是国民经济中的领导成分，而且在国民经济中，不断地在增加着它的比重。由于国家的社会主义工业化的进行，由于主要工业原料已经掌握在国家手里，由于国家掌握物资的范围逐步地在扩大，由于国内市场的批发环节和对外贸易也掌握在国家手里，由于国民经济计划化的工作正在稳步前进，——这一切，就使国营经济在国民经济中的领导作用，更加增强，就使我们能够在工业生产上进行统一安排。
    现在各地已经在统筹兼顾的原则之下，对各种类型的工业生产，进行了和进行着统一安排。为了贯彻国家的统筹兼顾的方针，我们必须注意下列一些问题：
    第一、为了维持某些发生严重困难的私营工业的生产，在必要和可能的条件下，国营工业要对私营工业进行照顾，以便使它们能够维持生产。这就是国营经济在分配原料和生产任务的时候，对于公私合营和私营工业，要给予适当的安排。有的行业，国家没有经营或者经营得很少的，则应由主管部门，在公私之间，地区之间，统筹安排。在安排生产的时候，忘记了有所不同，忘记了保证社会主义成分的不断增长，那是错误的；同时，只看见国营经济而忘记了私营经济，或者只照顾了规模较大的大厂，而不照顾规模较小的中小厂，也都是错误的。必须纠正这些不正确的观点，必须适当安排私营工业的生产，才能使我们的社会主义改造工作，得以顺利进行。
    第二、适当安排私营工业的生产，是今天的重要工作。但对私营工业的安排和维持，并不是要把资本主义的生产方式永远维持下去，而是为了替社会主义改造准备有利的条件。因此，对于私营工业的统一安排，必须同生产改组结合起来。可以进行公私合营的，就进行合营；需要准备条件，需要进行生产改组的，就采取以大厂带小厂，以先进带落后的办法，进行并厂和生产改组，并使这种改组工作和合营工作结合起来；需要而且可能迁厂的，就帮助迁厂，在适当时期再进行公私合营。至于极少数过于落后以至有害的企业，没有改造条件，则可以有计划、有步骤地安排其人员，淘汰其企业，并鼓励和指导他们把资金投资到有利于国计民生的事业中去。
    第三、为了对各种类型的工业生产进行统一安排，必须合理地利用原有工业设备，控制新建和扩建工程。在轻工业方面，尤应重视这一点。现在很多轻工业的设备利用率很低，如果不合理利用，而又在其他地区进行新建和扩建工厂，从国家的观点来看，分明是多余的，分明是浪费的。因此，各地地方工业的投资，必须照顾到其他地方国营工业的情况；对于私营工业的扩展也要加以管理和控制。当前产品销售发生困难的一些行业，如制药、金笔、文具、印刷、针织等等，极大部分是由于过去几年盲目发展所引起的。我们必须接受这一教训：对于生产的发展，如果没有适当的控制和管理，就会盲目增产，就会生产过剩，就会变成困难。
    第四、对于私营工业要提倡提高技术。私营工业中技术落后的，要督促其改造；有害的产品（如坏药）要加以淘汰。现在有不少资本家，并不努力改善经营、提高技术，而是一味要国家替他背包袱，要国家对他们收购订货和加工，这是错误的。还有一些地方工业，不努力提高技术改善质量，而以限制外地品质优良的商品的办法，来保护本地品质较差的产品的市场。这也是错误的。我们的一切措施，应该使先进的不断提高，落后的赶上先进。只有这样，才能使我国的工业技术和产品品质不断提高。当然，这里说的先进和落后，只是指的生产技术和商品的品质、规格，而不是经济类型。如果把生产技术上的先进和落后，同生产关系上的先进落后（即先进的社会主义生产关系和落后的资本主义生产关系）混淆在一道，就会使我们对各种类型的工业生产的统一安排的工作，受到妨碍。
    第五、安排生产主要是通过加工订货的方式来进行的。为了安排生产的顺利进行，必须减少加工订货的盲目性，加强计划性和组织性，使工业方面的生产计划，尽量少变、小变和有步骤地变，以免过多影响生产。这就需要工业部门和商业部门的密切合作。目下有些城市的工业部门和商业部门，在加工、订货这一方面还有些脱节，这是必须纠正的。
    第六、统一安排生产和调整公私关系是密切结合的。为了使公私生产得到合理的安排，就必须使用各种社会力量。在这里，工会组织是很重要的，我们必须依靠工会组织和工人群众来做好生产安排的工作，来搞好生产；其次，工商业联合会和同业公会也是一个值得重视的组织。在安排生产的时候，有些地方，因为善于运用这一组织的力量，就使我们的工作处理得更加适当；有些地方，则因为没有发挥它的作用，就使我们的工作遇到一些不必要的阻力。这是值得我们注意的。
    第七、为了进行统一安排和按业改造，对于私营工业，必须按业进行调查研究，摸清其设备、产品、产量、原料需要量以及生产情况等，以便按国家建设和人民的需要，在产供销平衡的基础上，拟订按业安排的生产计划，为按业进行社会主义改造打下基础。许多行业不是一下子就能调查清楚的，需要有计划地逐步进行。
    为了贯彻国家对工业生产统筹兼顾的方针，中央各有关部门，特别是同私营工业有关的业务部门和行政部门，各地党委和人民委员会必须重视这一工作，必须加强对于这一方面的领导，加强对于这一工作的检查督促，及时掌握情况，及时研究并处理在统一安排生产过程中新发生的问题。只有加强对于工业生产统一安排的领导，只有贯彻对工业生产的统筹兼顾的方针，才能使国家对资本主义工业的社会主义改造的政策顺利进行下去。
