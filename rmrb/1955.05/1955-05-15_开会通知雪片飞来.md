To the Editor:

　　On the afternoon of April 25th, the joint state-private enterprise Western Hubei Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Yichang City, Hubei Province, received a series of meeting notices:

　　Urgent: The Municipal Industrial Bureau notified that a meeting to relay information would be held at 8:30 a.m. on the 26th. All Party, government, labor union cadres, and engineers, except those who must remain at the factory, must attend on time. The meeting will last a full day.

　　Most Urgent: The Municipal Party Committee Office urgently notified that a general cadre meeting would be held at 9:00 a.m. on the 26th. In addition to the Party branch secretary, each factory must also send a representative to attend.

　　The Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department sent two notices. One was that a meeting would be held at 2:00 p.m. on the 26th to report on the study and discussion of the draft revision of the Military Service Law; the other was that at 7:00 p.m. on the 26th, attendees would listen to a "Summary Report on the Education of Grassroots Cadres on Communist Moral Qualities." All grassroots cadres who participated in the study, as well as all members of the Youth League and labor union committees, must attend on time.

　　The Municipal People's Government also sent a notice: a meeting of demobilized and transferred military personnel would be held at 1:30 p.m. on the 26th to discuss supplementary amendments to the draft revision of the Military Service Law.

　　In addition, the Cotton, Yarn, and Fabric Company would hold a technical exchange meeting on the 26th, and someone from the factory was required to attend; the Labor Bureau would hold a wage meeting on the 26th, and the factory was required to send someone to attend.

　　Furthermore, the Provincial Sports Commission's work team would inspect the development of sports activities, and the Provincial Bureau of Statistics' work team would inspect the quality of statistical reports, both scheduled to visit the factory on the 26th, requiring cadres to receive and talk with them.

　　Faced with this mountain of notices, the factory director and Party branch secretary were worried. The factory had a total of nineteen Party, government, and labor union cadres, including five cadres sent to work in the factory and three on official business elsewhere. In addition, five administrative staff were capitalists. Although the Municipal Industrial Bureau later made some "concessions," telephoning to say that the Party branch secretary could attend other meetings, the other cadres had to attend; but what about the other meetings? Each meeting organizer stated that their meeting was very important. For example, the Municipal People's Government's notice stated: "It is the duty of every demobilized and transferred military person to offer opinions on the reform of our country's military service system, and each unit should be responsible for urging them to attend the meeting on time." We had to squeeze someone out to attend. However, this demobilized and transferred military person was also responsible for labor and wage work, and the Labor Bureau instructed by telephone that he must attend the wage meeting, otherwise "how will the work be done in the future?"

　　What to do? Let all the cadres mobilize and attend meetings separately! Some cadres had to rush to two meetings on the 26th. As for the work on the 26th, it could only be postponed to the next day.

### 开会通知雪片飞来

　　开会通知雪片飞来编辑同志：
    四月二十五日下午，湖北宜昌市公私合营鄂西染织厂接到一连串的开会通知：
    急件，市工业局通知：二十六日上午八时半开传达会，党政工团干部和工程师除必须留厂的以外，都要准时参加，会议时间是一天。
    最急件，市委办公室紧急通知：二十六日上午九时开全体干部大会，各工厂除了党支部书记外，还要派代表参加。
    市委宣传部送来了两个通知。一个是：二十六日下午二时开会汇报学习和讨论兵役法修正草案的情况；另一个是：二十六日下午七时听取
  “关于基层干部学习共产主义道德品质教育的总结报告”，参加学习的基层干部和青年团、工会的全体委员都要按时出席。
    市人民政府也有通知：二十六日下午一时半召集复员转业军人开会，座谈对兵役法修正草案的补充修正意见。
    还有，花纱布公司二十六日开技术交流会，厂里要有人参加；劳动局二十六日开工资会议，厂里必须派人出席。
    另外，省体育运动委员会工作组检查体育活动开展情况，省统计局工作组检查统计报表质量，都约定二十六日来厂，需要有干部接谈。
    面对着这一大堆通知，厂长和党支部书记发愁了。厂里党政工团的干部一共是十九名，其中包括五名下厂干部和三名公差外出的干部，另外行政职员中还有五个是资本家。市工业局后来虽然作了一些“让步”，电话通知说党支部书记可以参加其它会议，但是其余干部必须出席；别的会议又怎么办呢？每一个会议，召开的单位都说明是很重要的。如市人民政府的通知上写道：
  “对我国兵役制度的改革提出意见，是每一个复员转业军人的义务，各单位应负责督促其按时到会”。我们不得不挤出一个人去出席。但是这个复员转业军人又是搞劳动工资工作的，劳动局在电话上指示必须让他出席工资会议，否则“以后工作怎么办”？
    怎么办？让干部全体动员，分头开会去吧！有的干部二十六日一天还不得不赶上两个会。至于二十六日的工作，只能推到第二天再说。
