Vividly Reflecting Party Life
　　Shí Xīn

　　Two authors once wrote a news report for the Heilongjiang Daily titled "In Order to Complete the Plan." Through two specific examples, this news report vividly illustrated how the Dongshan Shaft Work Area Branch of the CCP Hegang City, when encountering difficulties in completing the state plan for the enterprise, conducted thorough and in-depth investigations from various angles to find out the reasons for not being able to complete the plan. On one hand, they urged the administrative side to solve specific problems, and on the other hand, they led the trade union and the Communist Youth League to carry out extensive ideological and political work among the masses, mobilizing the power of all party members and workers to overcome difficulties, thereby ensuring the completion of the state plan. This news report provided a vivid example of how party organizations in factories and mines can guarantee and promote production. However, at the time, individual leading comrades in the Heilongjiang Daily editorial department believed that it was not serious enough to introduce the working experience of the Party in this descriptive way, and they disagreed with publishing the news report. Later, this news report was published in the People's Daily on October 13, 1954.

    Of course, individual leading comrades of the Heilongjiang Daily have now changed their views as mentioned above. However, the idea that the task of the Party Life column is only to introduce the working experience of the Party, and that the introduction of working experience can only adopt "formal" methods such as summary reports, is not unique to a few comrades in many newspaper editorial departments. This is an important reason why many newspapers' Party Life columns are boring and unattractive to readers.

    Is it impossible for newspaper reports on Party life to be lively, vivid, and rich? This is not only unreasonable in theory, but has also been negated by the practical experience of some newspapers. Since the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Liberation Daily has made relatively significant achievements in vividly reflecting Party life.

    When some newspapers solicited readers' opinions on the Party Life column, some readers suggested that they disliked reading articles introducing experience the most. Of course, this is not because people do not need the working experience of the Party. No. Lenin said that the art of leadership is not innate, but comes from experience. Our party organizations at all levels urgently need to learn and improve the art of leadership. It is entirely correct for newspapers to attach importance to introducing the working experience of the Party. The problem is only that, as some newspaper readers have pointed out, there are more "experiences" and fewer typical events reported in newspapers; many manuscripts are not written specifically or vividly, and are often concepts plus examples. Some newspapers even list several "experiences" in short articles of about a thousand words, where dry clauses replace specific and vivid descriptions of events, and abstract principles cover up the activities of living people. It is understandable that readers do not welcome this kind of dry, stereotypical experience report.

    Liberation Daily has begun to break the old style in reporting the Party's working experience. It uses lively forms and rich and specific facts to elaborate on the Party's working experience. Taking the newspaper's introduction of the political work experience of the Party's grassroots organizations in factories and enterprises as an example. Under the title "Pay Attention to Economic Results When Conducting Political Work," the newspaper used the method of the Party Committee Secretary answering reporters' questions to specifically analyze the activities of the Party Branch of the Candy Workshop of the Yimin Food Factory, and systematically explained how the Party's grassroots organizations in factories and enterprises should carry out political work in conjunction with economic work. A news report titled "To Guarantee and Supervise Production, One Must Humbly Learn Professional Skills" described the specific process of a full-time Party Branch Secretary of the Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 5 from not understanding production skills to becoming familiar with production skills, so that the Party organization could better play its role in guaranteeing and supervising production. Another news report titled "Why Do Roller Flowers Fly All Over the Factory" showed that in the work of saving cotton in the fine yarn workshop of the State Cotton Factory No. 3, the Party Branch initially adopted a simplified approach, one-sidedly emphasizing mutual inspection and criticism within and between groups, resulting in roller flowers being scattered all over the factory; later, they paid attention to the political and ideological education of workers, and took specific measures to help them improve their skills, and the roller flower rate was truly reduced, vividly illustrating that the work of the Party is an in-depth and meticulous work of dealing with people. In solving the problem of how the Party's grassroots organizations in factories lead economic work, the newspaper not only published many articles that positively introduced experience in this area, but also published some articles that elaborated on this issue from the side and from different angles. One article used the personal experience of a workshop director of the State Cotton Factory No. 17 to illustrate from the perspective of administrative work the great role of the Party organization in closely combining economic work with political and ideological work in order for the enterprise to fully complete the state plan. Examples like the ones mentioned above can be frequently seen in the Liberation Daily in recent times. It is very obvious that if a newspaper, when introducing the Party's working experience, not only tells readers what the Party organization has done, but also tells readers how the Party organization did it, and if the newspaper can reveal the characteristics of this Party organization or that Party organization in carrying out work under different conditions and circumstances, it will not only be able to powerfully clarify certain principles of the Party's work, but also be able to truly teach the art of leadership to others.

    The richness and diversity of topics is another characteristic of Liberation Daily's reports on Party life. The lives of our party organizations and party members are rich and colorful. As long as the newspaper editorial department recognizes that the task of reporting on Party life is to comprehensively reflect Party life, and can go deep into the party organizations, especially grassroots organizations, and party members, it can find an inexhaustible source of rich and diverse topics. In this regard, we can see the efforts made by Liberation Daily. Although the Liberation Daily focused on solving the problem of how the Party organizations in factories and enterprises carried out political work in conjunction with economic work during this period, the Liberation Daily's reports on Party life were not limited to this issue; on this newspaper, we also saw many vivid reflections on Party life. For example, how a general meeting of all Party members in a cotton textile factory fully carried out criticism and self-criticism when electing a new committee; how a Party branch meeting in a university seriously and warmly discussed the application for Party membership of a famous professor; how three shift leaders (all Communist Party members) in a cotton textile factory who were not united overcame departmentalism, strengthened unity, and promoted production under the education and supervision of the Party branch; how a Party branch secretary of a factory, through careful investigation and patient persuasion, eliminated his family's concerns about the unified purchase and sale of grain, mobilized them to return to their hometown to produce, and used this example to promote other employees to mobilize family members who did not need to stay in Shanghai to return to their hometown to produce; how a Communist Party member went from pointing fingers at the masses to enthusiastically helping them, thereby improving relations with the masses.... The above are just a few examples. These examples are enough to illustrate how broad the topic of Party life reports can be. The wide variety of reporting topics is inseparable from the editorial department's attention to attracting a wide range of authors to participate in reporting on Party life. In the Party Life column of Liberation Daily, we not only saw staff members of Party organs writing for the newspaper, but also saw ordinary Communist Party members writing for the newspaper. For example, newly admitted probationary party members expressed their feelings and wishes in the newspaper, and Party propagandists narrated in the newspaper how they carried out propaganda and mobilization targeting the characteristics of different workers; we even saw members of the Communist Youth League raising questions about Party work that they were concerned about to the newspaper. Some newspapers, in practice, almost limited the task of reporting on Party life to introducing the Party's working experience, or even just the Party's experience in leading economic work and Party organizational work, and almost only staff members of Party organs wrote for the newspaper. It is not surprising that the reporting topics of these newspapers' Party Life appeared to be poor and narrow.

    Specifically and clearly carrying out praise and criticism is also a characteristic of Liberation Daily's reports on Party life. Liberation Daily frequently publishes manuscripts praising Party organizations and outstanding Communist Party members who are doing well. When conducting praise, the newspaper does not pursue a "comprehensive" model of a Party organization or Communist Party member, nor does it use abstract and conceptual phrases to describe their deeds. The newspaper strives to specifically describe an activity of a Party organization in a certain aspect, to reveal the thoughts and actions of a Communist Party member expressed in specific issues, and to reveal his relationship with the collective and with the masses. "Twenty Seconds" is one example. This article, through the fact that a Communist Party member in charge of fire protection, Lu Xingjiang, was often distressed because the fire truck was not dispatched quickly enough to extinguish the fire more promptly, through the fact that he once saw a cloth machine in a textile factory automatically turn off, and therefore boldly envisioned that the fire truck might also automatically start, and through the fact that he painstakingly researched to trial-produce an automatic starter for the fire truck, while relying on the masses to overcome difficulties, and finally successfully manufactured it, shortening the dispatch time of the fire truck by twenty seconds, vividly depicted the noble quality of a Communist Party member's high concern for the interests of the people, giving people a very deep impression. Like praise, Liberation Daily's criticism is also specific. These criticisms are often aimed at specific shortcomings and errors in the Party's work and life. For example, in "Why Was a Person with Theft Behavior Allowed to Enter the Party?", the erroneous practices of the Party organization of the State Cotton Factory No. 10 in lowering the conditions for Party members were criticized; in "The 'Depression' of the Party Branch of the Private Zhongyuan Telephone Equipment Manufacturing Factory", the Party branch's working style of treating workers with a rude attitude and deviating from the masses was criticized; in "Attending Branch Meetings Only Half a Year", the incorrect attitude of Liu Housheng, Deputy Director of the Art Department of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and Communist Party member, towards organizational life was criticized. It can be seen that the objects criticized by Liberation Daily are by no means limited to bad people and bad things; the way Liberation Daily conducts criticism is also different from the organizational decisions made by the Party organization to deal with Party members who have made mistakes. On the one hand, vigorously supporting and promoting the enthusiasm and initiative of Party organizations and Communist Party members, and on the other hand, carrying out specific and realistic criticism and self-criticism aimed at unhealthy phenomena in the Party's daily work and life, this makes it possible for the newspaper's Party Life column to be vibrant and combative.

    Flexibly using various weapons in the news arsenal is necessary to vividly reflect the rich content of Party life. If it is said that many newspapers at present are mainly limited to using the forms of editorials, short commentaries, articles, and news in Party life propaganda, then the forms used by Liberation Daily are more diverse. As mentioned earlier, this newspaper has used the forms of interviews and news reports to report on the Party's working experience. This newspaper has also used special features to reflect Party meetings, used letters from Communist Party members to carry out bottom-up criticism, and used the method of answering readers' questions to answer questions raised by readers about Party life. This shows that the Party life propaganda in newspapers, like other aspects of propaganda, can and should use a variety of literary forms. The seriousness of the content of Party life propaganda does not exclude the flexibility and vividness of the expression form. This is not only proven by the experience of Liberation Daily, but also by the experience of other newspapers. For example, when Shanxi Daily once reported that the Party branch of the Changzhi Prefectural Committee organs held a Party member meeting to criticize a Party member's erroneous behavior of violating national policies and rushing to buy cotton cloth, it adopted the form of a sketch, so that the serious ideological struggle within the Party was vividly reflected, and it was well received by many readers, who said that after reading this article, it was like watching a movie, the impression was very deep, and the educational significance for them was very great.

    From the above description of Liberation Daily's propaganda on Party life, it can be seen that Party life propaganda in newspapers should not only be lively, vivid, and rich, but also can be lively, vivid, and rich.

    生动地反映党的生活
　　湜辛
　　曾经有两个作者以“为了完成计划”为题，给黑龙江日报写了一篇通讯。这篇通讯通过两个具体事例，比较生动地说明了中共鹤岗市东山竖井工区支部在企业完成国家计划遇到困难时，怎样多方面地深入地进行调查研究，找出不能完成计划的原因，一面督促行政方面解决具体问题，一面领导工会和青年团在群众中进行广泛的思想政治工作，动员全体党员和工人的力量去克服困难，从而保证了国家计划的完成。这篇通讯提供了厂矿中的党组织如何保证和推动生产的一个活生生的例子。但是，当时黑龙江日报编辑部的个别领导同志认为以这种描述的方式来介绍党的工作经验是不够严肃的，他们不同意发表这篇通讯。后来，这篇通讯在一九五四年十月十三日的人民日报上发表了。
    当然，黑龙江日报的个别领导同志现在已经改变了上面所说的那种看法。但是认为党的生活栏的任务只是介绍党的工作经验，而介绍工作经验又只能采用诸如总结报告之类的“正规”方式，抱有这种想法的同志，在不少报纸编辑部中还不是个别的。这就是为什么不少报纸的党的生活栏办得枯燥乏味、不能吸引读者的一个重要原因。
    是不是报纸关于党的生活的报道不可能做到生动活泼、丰富多采呢？这不仅在道理上讲不通，而且已经为有些报纸的实践经验所否定。今年以来的上海解放日报，就在生动地反映党的生活这一点上做出了比较显著的成绩。
    有的报纸在征求读者对党的生活栏的意见时，曾有读者提出，他们最不爱看介绍经验的文章。这当然不是因为人们不需要党的工作经验。不是的。列宁说过，领导的艺术不是天赋的，而是从经验中得来的。我们的各级党组织迫切地需要学会和提高领导的艺术。报纸重视介绍党的工作经验是完全正确的。问题只是在于，正如有些报纸的读者所指出的，报纸上报道的“经验”多，典型事情少；许多稿件写的不具体不生动，常常是概念加例子。有的报纸甚至在千把字左右的短文中也罗列上好几条“经验”，在这里枯燥的条文代替了对事情的具体生动的叙述，抽象的原则掩盖了活生生的人的活动。读者不欢迎这种干巴巴的、千篇一律的经验报道，是可以理解的。
    解放日报在报道党的工作经验方面，开始打破了老一套的格调。运用生动活泼的形式和丰富具体的事实来阐述党的工作经验。以报纸介绍工厂企业中党的基层组织的政治工作经验为例。在“进行政治工作时注意经济效果”的题目下，报纸采用党委书记回答记者问题的方式，对益民食品一厂糖果车间党支部的活动作了具体分析，比较系统地阐明了工厂企业中的党的基层组织应当如何结合经济工作进行政治工作。一篇题为“要保证监督生产，就要虚心学习业务”的通讯，描述了上海卷烟五厂的一个专职党支部书记由不懂生产业务到熟悉生产业务，从而使党组织更好地发挥了保证监督生产作用的具体过程。另一篇题为“皮辊花为啥会满厂飞”的通讯，则通过国棉三厂细纱间党支部在节约用棉工作中，起初采用简单化的方式，片面强调小组内和小组间的相互检查和批评，结果皮辊花化整为零满厂飞；后来重视了对工人的政治思想教育，又采取具体措施帮助她们提高技术，皮辊花率才真正降低的事实，生动地说明了党的工作是一种深入细致的对待人的工作。报纸在解决工厂中的党的基层组织领导经济工作的问题时，不单发表了许多从正面介绍这方面经验的文章，同时也发表了若干从侧面、从不同的角度阐述这个问题的文章。有一篇文章就以国棉十七厂一个工场场长的亲身体会，从行政工作的角度，说明了党组织紧密结合经济工作进行政治思想工作对于企业全面完成国家计划的重大作用。像上面所举的例子，在最近一个时期的解放日报上是经常可以见到的。十分明显，如果报纸在介绍党的工作经验时，不仅告诉读者党组织做了什么，而且告诉读者党组织是怎样做的，如果报纸能够揭示出这一党组织或那一党组织在不同的条件和情况下进行工作的特点，那就不只是能够有力地阐明党的工作的某些原则，而且能够真正把领导的艺术教给别人。
    题材的丰富多样，是解放日报关于党的生活的报道的另一特点。我们的党组织和党员群众的生活是丰富多采的。只要报纸编辑部认识到党的生活的报道任务是全面地反映党的生活，并能深入到党组织特别是基层组织和党员群众中去，它就能够找到取之不尽的丰富多样的题材。在这一方面，我们可以看出解放日报所作的努力。虽然这一时期解放日报着重解决的是工厂企业中的党组织如何结合经济工作进行政治工作的问题，但是解放日报关于党的生活的报道并没有局限于这个问题；在这个报纸上，我们同样看到了关于党内生活的许多生动反映。举例说，一个棉纺织工厂的全体党员大会在选举新的委员会时，怎样充分地开展批评和自我批评；一个高等学校党的支部大会怎样严肃而热烈地讨论一个著名教授的入党请求；一个棉纺织厂的三个闹不团结的值班长（都是共产党员），怎样在党支部的教育和监督下，克服了本位主义，增强了团结，推动了生产；一个工厂的支部书记怎样经过仔细的调查和耐心的说服，消除了自己的家属对粮食统购统销的顾虑，动员他们回乡生产，并以这个实例来推动其他职工动员没有必要留在上海的家属回乡生产；一个共产党员怎样由对群众指手划脚到热情帮助，从而改善了同群众的关系……。以上不过是几个例子。这些例子也足以说明，党的生活的报道题材可以多么广泛。报道题材的广泛多样，是同编辑部注意吸引广泛的作者参加党的生活的报道分不开的。在解放日报党的生活栏中，我们不仅看到了党机关的工作人员为报纸写稿，而且看到了普通的共产党员为报纸写稿，例如，新入党的候补党员在报上表达他们的感想和意愿，党的宣传员在报上叙述他们怎样针对不同工人的特点进行宣传鼓动；我们甚至看到了青年团员向报纸提出了他们所关心的有关党的工作的问题。有的报纸在实践中把党的生活的报道任务几乎只局限为介绍党的工作经验，甚至只是党领导经济工作和党的组织工作经验，为报纸写稿的也几乎只是一些党机关的工作人员，这样，这些报纸的党的生活的报道题材显得贫乏和狭窄就不足为奇了。
    具体而鲜明地进行表扬和批评，也是解放日报关于党的生活报道的一个特点。解放日报经常发表表扬工作得好的党组织和优秀共产党员的稿件。报纸在进行表扬时，既不是追求一个党组织或共产党员的“全面”模范事迹，也不是用抽象的和概念的辞句来叙述他们的事迹。报纸力求具体地叙述一个党组织的某一方面的活动，揭示一个共产党员表现在具体问题上的思想和行动，揭示他同集体、同群众的关系。“二十秒钟”就是一个例子。这篇文章通过一个担任消防工作的共产党员——陆杏江经常因为消防车出车不够迅速以致不能更及时地扑灭火灾而苦恼的事实，通过他某次在一个纺织厂看到布机车会自动关车，因而大胆地设想消防车也可能自动开车的事实，通过他为试制消防车自动发动器而苦心钻研，同时依靠群众，克服困难，终于制造成功，使消防车的出车时间缩短了二十秒钟的事实，对一个共产党员高度关怀人民利益的高贵品质作了鲜明的描绘，给了人们极为深刻的印象。和表扬一样，解放日报的批评也是具体的。这些批评经常是针对党的工作和生活中的具体缺点和错误而提出的。例如，在“为什么让一个有偷窃行为的人混进了党？”一文中，批评了国棉十厂党组织降低党员条件的错误做法；在“私营中原电话器材制造厂党支部的‘苦闷’”一文中，批评了这个党支部以粗暴态度对待工人的脱离群众的工作作风；在“一年只参加半次支部大会”一文中，批评了上海市文化局艺术处副处长、共产党员刘厚生对待组织生活的不正确态度。可以看出，解放日报所批评的对象绝不止于坏人坏事；解放日报进行批评的方式，也不同于党组织对犯了错误的党员所作的组织处理的决定。一方面，经常对党组织和共产党员的积极性和主动性给予有力的支持和发扬，另一方面，针对党的日常工作和生活中的不健康现象开展具体的、实事求是的批评和自我批评，这就有可能使得报纸的党的生活栏生气勃勃和富于战斗性。
    灵活地运用新闻武器库中的各种武器，是生动地反映党的生活的丰富内容所必需的。如果说目前很多报纸在党的生活宣传中主要地还只限于运用社论、短评、文章和消息的形式的话，那末，解放日报所运用的形式是较为多样的。前面已经说过，这个报纸曾经以访问记和通讯的形式来报道党的工作经验。这个报纸还曾经用特写的形式来反映党的会议，用共产党员来信的方式开展自下而上的批评，用答读者问的方式解答读者所提出的有关党的生活的问题。这就说明了，报纸上的党的生活宣传，也和其他方面的宣传一样，可能而且应当运用多种多样的文学形式。党的生活宣传的内容的严肃性绝不排斥表现形式的灵活和生动。这不但为解放日报的经验所证明，也已为其他报纸的经验所证明。像山西日报有一次报道长治地委机关支部召开党员大会批判一个党员违背国家政策抢购棉布的错误行为，采用速写的形式，使党内的严肃的思想斗争得到了活生生的反映，便受到许多读者的好评，他们说看了这篇文章就像看电影一样，印象很深刻，对自己的教育意义很大。
    从以上关于解放日报对党的生活宣传的叙述可以看出，报纸上的党的生活宣传不仅应当做到生动活泼、丰富多采，而且也是能够做到生动活泼、丰富多采的。
