Our Encounter
　　Xu Jing　Lü Shigui

　　We are both graduates of the Forging Specialization Program of the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in the summer of 1954. Our major was mainly forging technology, cold stamping, and workshop equipment. The work unit we were assigned to was the Pipeline Engineering Company of the Construction and Installation Bureau (formerly under the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Ministry). The Pipeline Engineering Company of the Construction and Installation Bureau, as the name suggests, mainly installs pipes for water supply and drainage, heating, and ventilation. Needless to say, assigning someone who studied forging to work in such a department is very inappropriate. Especially considering how we have been utilized, it is even more unreasonable. However, many opinions we raised were not taken into account and were met with unreasonable suppression and undue criticism.

　　For example, Xu Jing was initially assigned to an affiliated processing plant. At that time, this processing plant only had two lathes, but it already had three graduates majoring in metal cutting and three graduates from secondary technical schools. Even they had changed their profession because they had nowhere else to be placed. Of course, it was even more pointless for Xu Jing, who studied forging, to be here. As such, she was then assigned to the manual pipe bending team. After this, she did the following specific tasks: borrowing tools for plumbers, urging the materials team for coal, checking pipes for cracks, and so on. By October 1954, even the manual pipe bending team had nothing of this sort for her to do. Helpless, Xu Jing had to return to the office to help others with tasks like cutting stencils or writing slogans for the trade union. Because everyone generally felt the same way: it’s better to have something to do than nothing. But as days went by, it was not sustainable to continue like this, so Xu Jing raised her concerns with the leadership. But the leadership said it was a “work need.” This was very perplexing because it was clear that many people who studied other majors were being reassigned to forging, while we, who studied forging, were being reassigned to another field here. Was this also for "work needs"? This was not all. What was even more perplexing was that in December 1954, the leadership reassigned Xu Jing to another field, heating and ventilation. Then, the company issued a transfer order, bringing Xu Jing back to be reassigned to a third field, doing construction organization design for water supply and drainage. Because Xu Jing fundamentally did not understand this technology, she could only help others with copying and writing all day long.

　　Similarly, Lü Shigui was initially assigned to the construction organization design team of the Engineering Technology Department. He had no work for more than twenty days after arriving. Later, the company organized an inspection team headed by Section Chief Li Yin. Although Lü Shigui knew nothing about pipeline work, he was also included in the team. Thus, Lü Shigui followed Section Chief Li Yin to construction sites around Jilin to inspect the work. Li Yin asked Lü Shigui to follow him, and while he conducted interviews at the site, Lü Shigui took notes beside him. Next, the inspection team arrived at the Harbin construction site, and Li Yin left Lü Shigui in the construction technology team there. At that time, Team Leader Zhao Zhuoyu asked Lü Shigui to work on business plans. This so-called business plan actually involved: after the foremen compiled their ten-day operation plans, Lü Shigui would obtain them, copy them, bind them together, and then distribute them to each foreman. The ten-day operation plan was compiled every ten days, and Lü Shigui would copy, bind, and distribute them every ten days, each time requiring only one day. After some time, Lü Shigui was transferred back to the Engineering Technology Department. After returning to the department, he was asked to compile winter training materials for welding and standard operating procedures for gas welding quality. But before this work was finished, he was transferred to a construction site. Here, after looking at the drawings for two weeks, the construction site director asked him to help with the winter training work for plumbers. For six or seven months, Lü Shigui had been "tossed back and forth" like this. For this reason, Lü Shigui had spoken with Li Yin several times, requesting an adjustment; but Li Yin said: "This is a national need, you should obey. You have studied physics and chemistry, and you also know about water pumps, so you cannot be considered to have changed your profession here. Your request for an adjustment is only a problem of your understanding." He also said in a very harsh tone: "Not only will you work here now, but you will also work here in the future."

　　Regarding the above unreasonable assignment and utilization, starting from September 19, 1954, we successively wrote letters to the former Central Ministry of Personnel, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Shanghai Municipal Personnel Bureau, and the personnel section of the Pipeline Engineering Company of the Construction and Installation Bureau. Eventually, all the letters were forwarded to the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau. However, we waited for one or two months without any response. We felt that the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau's delay in responding to our letters was wrong, so we wrote another letter to the Supreme People's Procuratorate. Finally, the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau's reply came. However, judging from the reply from the Cadre Department of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau to Xu Jing, they not only had no understanding of the cadre assignment and utilization situation below but also adopted a suppressive attitude towards cadres. They first said: "Forging is a part of machinery. Studying forging requires having knowledge of mechanical principles. Don't you even understand mechanical principles? The position you are assigned to now is also a part of machinery. How can this be considered a complete change of profession? You stated in your letter that 'the forging major is the unprecedented first class in Chinese history.' Then, is there a second factory in China where you are currently working?" But we believe that the course on mechanical principles is studied by people majoring in civil engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanics because it is a basic knowledge course. It cannot be said that because people studying forging have also studied mechanical principles, doing the kind of work we do in the Pipeline Engineering Company is not considered a change of profession. In particular, we feel that our statement that "the forging major is the unprecedented first class in Chinese history" has no relationship to their question of whether there is a second factory in China where we are currently working. They were just getting angry and showing an attitude towards us. Because after criticizing our "expert mentality," they also said: "Every time your letters are in a questioning and commanding tone. Can this make the organization handle matters according to your opinions? We know very well that cadre issues are our responsibility. If there are genuine cases of mismatch between what is learned and what is used, we will make adjustments; but for those who emphasize the mismatch, we will definitely not make adjustments just because we see a few questioning and commanding letters." May we ask, isn't this getting angry and showing an attitude towards us?

　　This is not the main point. What is more serious is that on January 30, 1955, based on the Cadre Department of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau's reply letter to Xu Jing, the Pipeline Engineering Company also issued a circular in the name of three managers. The circular stated: Most of the college graduates assigned to the Pipeline Engineering Company by higher-level authorities have recognized the spirit of unified assignment, but there are also individual individuals who do not adequately understand the principle of unified assignment, so they are not at ease with their work and constantly shout about "mismatch between what is learned and what is used," "my major cannot be combined with the pipeline major," "improper assignment," "inappropriate utilization," and so on, to explain why they are not at ease with their work. Wu Shiming, Lü Shigui, Xu Jing, and others assigned from higher-level authorities are relatively typical examples. Therefore, the company decided to send Comrades Wu Shiming and Liu Bo back to the higher-level authorities and suggested that appropriate disciplinary actions be taken based on the severity of their mistakes. At the same time, it was believed that Xu Jing's thinking was the most prominent, so the circular stated that college graduates uniformly assigned by higher-level authorities should take this as a warning. If they have similar ideological situations as Xu Jing, they should quickly overcome them.

　　In addition to the Youth League Secretary Yu Hao reading this circular at a specially convened youth conference, the Deputy Secretary of the Youth League Sui Qingchi also emphasized during a Youth League class that people who want to return to their original profession have a "matter of principle between individual interests and collective interests," which is "individualism" and a "matter of communist moral character." He also said: "Gorky used to be a doorman... What does changing a profession count for!" In addition, Youth League Secretary Yu Hao also talked to us once. He said: "If you want to return to your original profession, if your thinking has changed now, we can ask you to give a report at the conference to talk about the process of the transformation (i.e., how to establish the idea of changing professions) to educate everyone; otherwise, we will hold a meeting for everyone to 'help' you." In order to clarify the issue and see if there were any errors in the opinions we raised, we spoke with Party Committee Secretary Wang Xunyou. But he said: "Requesting to return to the original profession is mainly a matter of understanding." He also said: "The Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau's reply to you is well said: those who have studied mechanical principles, once they understand the principles, understand everything."

　　The above encounters all occurred before the People's Daily published an editorial titled "Reasonable Use of University Graduates" on March 18, 1955. After this, the Youth League Committee, in order to continue to resolve the "cognitive issues" regarding the consistency between learning and application, also held several discussion forums, presided over by the Deputy Secretary of the Youth League Sui Qingchi. However, the purpose of the forums was not to solve the company's existing problems in this regard in a pragmatic way but to continue to criticize our "individualism."

　　We believe that this series of practices is wrong. Of course, this series of wrong practices is also inseparable from the Cadre Department of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau's reply to us. We feel that we have the right to demand that we be used reasonably, and it is completely wrong for us to be subjected to unreasonable criticism and suppression.

　　我们的遭遇
　　徐静　吕仕贵
    我们都是一九五四年暑期上海交通大学机械制造系锻工专修科毕业生，学的专业主要是锻造工学、冷冲压和车间设备。我们被分配去的工作单位是建筑安装局管道工程公司（过去属中央重工业部有色金属工业管理局）。建筑安装局管道工程公司，顾名思义，它的工作内容主要是安装上下水道和暖气通风等管子，不用说，分配一个学锻工专业的人到这样的部门来工作，是很不对路的。特别是从我们被使用的情况上看，更不合理。但我们提了许多意见都没有用，并遭到许多无理的压制和不应有的批评。
    如徐静，最初是被分配到一个附属的加工厂。这个加工厂，当时只有两台车床，却已有三名金属切削专业的毕业生，三名中等技术学校的毕业生，连他们都是由于无处安插而改了行的，当然，徐静这个学锻工的到这里来就更无事可做了。如此，她又被派到人工弯管组。这以后，便做了这样的一些具体工作：替水暖工借工具，给材料组催煤炭，检查管子上是否有裂纹等等。一九五四年十月，人工弯管组是连这类的事情都没有可做的了。无法，徐静只好又回到室内帮助别人刻刻蜡纸，或给工会写写标语。因为一般人的心情都是一样的：有事做总比没事做好些。可是时间一天天过去，总这样是不行的，所以徐静便向领导方面提出了意见。但领导方面说这是“工作需要”。这很使人想不通，因为明明有许多学别的专业的都改作锻工，而我们学锻工的在这里却又改了另一行，难道这也是为了“工作需要”么？这还不算，更使人想不通的是：等到一九五四年十二月，领导方面又让徐静改了另一行，搞暖气通风。接着，公司来了调令，又把徐静调回来，改了第三个行，做上下水道施工组织设计工作。徐静因为根本不懂得这门技术，所以，终日里只好帮助旁人抄抄写写。
    又如吕仕贵，开始时是被分配到工程技术科施工组织设计组，去了二十多天也没有工作。后来，公司组织了一个以李印科长为首的检查组，吕仕贵虽对管道工作一窍不通，但也被编了进去。这样，吕仕贵便跟随李印科长到吉林一带工地上检查工作去了。李印叫吕仕贵跟着他，他在现厂进行访问，吕仕贵就在旁边作记录。接着，检查组到了哈尔滨工地，李印把吕仕贵留在那里的施工技术组。当时赵琢玉组长叫吕仕贵搞业务计划。这所谓搞业务计划，其实是：当工长编好旬作业计划后，吕仕贵就去要来加以复写，然后再装订起来，分发给各工长。旬作业计划是十天编一次，吕仕贵也就十天复写、装订、分发一次，每次，只一天时间便足够了。这样过了一段时间，吕仕贵又被调回工程技术科。回科后，又叫编焊接冬训教材和编气焊质量标准操作规程。但这工作还没结束，又调到一工地。在这里，看了两星期图纸，工地主任又叫去帮助做水暖工冬训工作。六、七个月以来，吕仕贵就是这样被“东掷西抛”的。为此，吕仕贵曾经找李印谈过几次，请求调整；但李印说：“这是国家需要，你们应该服从。你们学过理化，也知道水泵，所以你们在这里不能算改行。你要求调整，这只是你的认识问题。”他并且态度十分恶劣地说：“你不但现在要在这里工作，而且将来还要在这里工作。”
    对上述分配使用不合理的情况，从一九五四年九月十九日起，我们曾先后分别写信给前中央人事部、重工业部、重工业部所属有色金属工业管理局、上海市人事局、建筑安装局管道工程公司人事科，最后，所有信件都转给了有色金属工业管理局。可是我们等了一两个月，也没有回音。我们觉得，有色金属工业管理局对我们的来信所采取的这种拖延态度是不对的，所以我们又写信给最高人民检察院。这样，有色金属工业管理局的复信终于来了。但从有色金属工业管理局干部处给徐静的复信看，他们不但对下面分配使用干部的情况毫无了解，而且对干部采取了一种压制的态度。他们首先说：“锻工是机械的一部分，学习锻工就必须具有机械的原理，难道你连机械原理也不懂吗？现分配你的岗位也是机械的一部分，这又算什么完全大改行呢？你信内称：‘锻工专业是中国历史上空前的第一班’，那末，中国有第二个你现在工作的工厂吗？”但我们认为，机械原理这一门课程，无论是学土木、电机、机械的人都学过，因为它是一门基础知识课程，不能因为学锻工的也学过机械原理，在管道工程公司做像我们那样的工作就不算改行。特别是我们觉得，我们说“锻工专业是中国历史上空前的第一班”，和他们质问我们说，中国有没有第二个我们现在工作的工厂是毫无关系的，他们不过是在和我们发脾气，耍态度。因为他们在指责了我们的“专家思想”之后还这样说：“你每次信内都是质问、命令的口气，这样就能使组织按你的意见处理吗？我们很知道干部问题是我们应负的责任，有真正学用不一致者，我们会调整的；但对那些强调学用不一致者，也决不能因见到几次质问、命令的信件，即给以调整。”请问，这不是和我们发脾气、耍态度是什么呢？
    这还不要紧，更严重的是，在一九五五年一月三十日，管道工程公司根据有色金属工业管理局干部处给徐静的这封回信，还用三位经理的名义发了一个通报。通报说：从上级机关分配到管道工程公司的高等学校毕业生，大多数认识了统一分配的精神，但也有个别的人，对统一分配的原则认识不足，所以就不安心工作，成天喊“学用不一致”啦，“我所学的专业与管道专业结合不上”啦，“分配不妥”、“使用不当”啦，等等，来解释为什么不安心工作。从上级机关分配来的吴世铭、吕仕贵、徐静等就是比较典型的。所以公司决定将吴世铭、刘波二同志送回上级机关去，并建议根据他们的错误程度给予适当的处分。同时认为徐静的思想是最突出的，所以通报说，由上级机关统一分配来的大专毕业的同学应引以为戒，如在思想上有同徐静类似的思想情况，应赶快克服。
    这个通报除由团委书记于浩在特别召开的一次青年大会上宣读过外，团委副书记隋清池在讲团课时还强调说，要回本行去工作的人是一个“个人利益和集体利益的原则问题”，是“个人主义”，是“共产主义道德品质问题”。他还说：“高尔基以前还给人家看过门，……改行又算了什么！”此外，团委书记于浩还找我们谈了一次话，他说：“你们要回本行去，假如现在思想转变过来了，我们可以请你们在大会上来一个报告，谈谈转变过程（即如何树立改行思想），借以教育大家；否则，开会由大家‘帮助’你们。”我们为了把问题弄清楚，看看我们提的意见是否有错误，曾找党委书记王训友谈过话。但他说：“要求回本行去，这主要是认识问题。”他并说：“有色金属工业管理局给你们的回信说得好，学过机械原理的人，原理一通，一通百通。”
    以上遭遇，都是在一九五五年三月十八日人民日报发表了题为“合理使用高等学校毕业生”的社论以前的事情。这以后，团委会为继续解决在学用一致上的“认识问题”，还由团委副书记隋清池主持，举行了几次座谈会。但座谈的目的不是为了实事求是地解决公司在这方面存在的问题，而是为了继续批判我们的“个人主义”。
    我们认为，这一系列的作法，都是错误的。当然，这一系列的错误的作法，也是和有色金属工业管理局干部处给我们的回信分不开的。我们觉得，我们有要求合理使用我们的权利，我们受到无理的批评和压制是完全不应该的。
