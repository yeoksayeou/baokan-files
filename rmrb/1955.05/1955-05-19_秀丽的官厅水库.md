    The Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River, completed last May, has become a beautiful scenic spot outside the Juyong Pass of the Great Wall. Now, the Guanting Reservoir has put on the new attire of early summer. Standing on the dam and looking north, on the vast artificial lake, speedboats measuring water levels and wooden boats collecting floating objects cut through the green lake surface with their white sails. More than 20,000 newly planted willows and fruit trees on the lake shore and mountains have grown new leaves. Peach blossoms have just faded, and crabapples are in full bloom. Farmers in Huailai and Yanqing counties along the lake have transplanted more than 126,000 willows and more than 7,700 various fruit trees such as apples and grapes. The Hebei Provincial Third Sanatorium, which was completed last year on the west bank of the lake, has begun to receive recuperating staff. In the Nanshanbao area on the southeast bank of "Guanting Lake," a large-scale joint farm for orchards, grains, animal husbandry, and fish farming is being planned. The Aquatic Products Management Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture has signed contracts with the Baiyangdian Aquatic Products Experimental Farm in Hebei Province and the Baoding People's Park to supply fish fry. This autumn, a total of 300,000 carp, silver carp, and bighead carp will be stocked in "Guanting Lake." The Ministry of Water Resources is also preparing to establish a cadre school here. On the east bank of the reservoir, the hydropower station project is under construction day and night, and the large water diversion and power generation tunnel has been opened; office buildings and dormitories are under construction at the foot of the ancient beacon tower and on the green hillside. On the west bank of the reservoir, the newly built Fengsha section of the Beijing-Baotou Railway has established the "Guanting Station" not far from the dam.
    It is hard to imagine that before the construction of the reservoir, this place was a barren mountain valley. During the spring flood season, sandstorms filled the sky, and the Sanggan River, Yang River, and Gui River above Guanting broke through the ice and rushed downstream with a large amount of sediment.... Now, the dam standing in the throat of the Guanting Gorge blocks its path and gathers it into a lake. The torrent slowly calmed down, and the sediment settled; for the first time in thousands of years, the Yongding River water has become so clear and lovely. Last autumn, the Guanting Reservoir Management Office and nearby farmers cleaned the bottom of the reservoir and removed tens of thousands of pounds of garbage, laying the foundation for future water supply to the people and industries of the capital. When flood storage is needed, the eight steel gates of the intake tower can be fully closed; at that time, "Guanting Lake" will be even more vast and magnificent.
    The beautiful scenery of the Guanting Reservoir attracts a large number of tourists. Since the beginning of spring, nearly 20,000 people from Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou and other places have requested to visit the reservoir management office. By the end of April, more than 8,000 cadres, workers, and young students had come here to appreciate the lake and mountain scenery outside the Great Wall. Not long ago, more than 200 trade union representatives from 27 countries on five continents also came to visit this great water conservancy achievement. There are even more tourists on weekends. Farmers near the reservoir also often ride donkeys or take boats to participate in the workers' entertainment evenings.

### 秀丽的官厅水库

　　秀丽的官厅水库
　　新华社记者　方凌
    去年五月完工的永定河官厅水库，已成为长城居庸关外的一个幽美的风景区。现在官厅水库已披上初夏的新装。站在拦河坝上凭栏北望，辽阔的人工湖上，测量水位的汽艇，划破了绿色的湖面，打捞浮物的木船扬着白帆。在湖畔和山峦上新栽的两万多棵杨柳和果树已长出新叶。桃花刚谢，海棠又在盛开。沿湖的怀来、延庆两县的农民移植了十二万六千多棵杨柳和七千七百多棵苹果、葡萄等各种果树。去年在湖西岸兴建完工的河北省第三疗养院已开始接待休养员。在“官厅湖”东南岸的南山堡一带，一座大型的果园、谷物、畜牧和养鱼的联合农场正在筹建。农业部水产管理总局已和河北省白洋淀水产试验场、保定市人民公园订立了供应鱼种的合同，今年秋天，将在“官厅湖”放养鲤鱼、白鲢、花鲢等鱼类共三十万尾。水利部也正筹备在这儿兴办干部学校。水库东岸的水电站工程正在日夜进行施工，引水发电的大隧洞已经打通；一幢幢办公大楼和宿舍已在古老的烽火台下、青翠的山腰上动工兴建。水库西岸，新建的京包线丰沙段铁路，已在离拦河坝不远的地方建立了“官厅车站”。
    这番景象，很难使人想像到在修建水库以前，这里还是荒山野谷，在春汛到来的日子里，风沙漫天，官厅以上的桑干河、洋河和妫水河河水冲破冰封，挟着大量泥沙，呼啸着向下游奔去……。现在，屹立在官厅山峡咽喉的拦河大坝挡住了它的去路，把它汇聚成湖。激流慢慢地静下来，泥沙沉淀了；几千年来，永定河水第一次变得这么清澈可爱。去年深秋，官厅水库管理处和附近农民，清理了库底，清除了上万斤的垃圾，为将来供给首都人民和工业用水打下了基础。需要蓄洪的时候，进水塔的八个钢铁闸门就可全部关闭；那时，“官厅湖”就更加辽阔而壮观。
    景色秀丽的官厅水库吸引着大量游客。入春以来，北京、天津和张家口等地向水库管理处要求来参观的人近两万名。到四月底，已有八千余干部、工人和青年学生来这里欣赏了塞外的湖光山色。不久以前，来自世界五大洲的二十七国工会代表二百多人，也来参观了这个伟大的水利建设成就。每逢周末，游人更多。水库附近的农民，也时常骑着毛驴或乘船到这里来参加工人的文娱晚会。
