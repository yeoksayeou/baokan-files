Dark Soul
Wu Boxiao

Shu Wu peeled off a layer of Hu Feng, and Hu Feng's true colors were exposed. "Literary theorist," "poet," what magnificent signboards! Once the mask is removed, what an ugly face it is.

A writer should have been an "engineer of the human soul," but according to the materials revealed by Shu Wu, such a writer is a great insult to the title of "engineer of the soul." Hu Feng adopted a hostile attitude towards the Communist Party, which the people called their savior, and towards the Party comrades, with whom everyone felt close. He used the most vicious words to curse the Party and Party comrades. Hu Feng called progressive literary workers "maggots" and "philistines," he wanted to "warn them... to shake hands and make merry with smiles concealing contempt..." He wanted to use "a whip wrapped in rubber-coated steel wire to beat prisoners" to "return" the criticism of those who wrote “On Subjectivity,” considering it a "good method" that "inflicts injury that is not visible on the surface." He described the Dragon Boat Festival commemorating the great patriotic poet Qu Yuan as "jumping to officialdom for poets." He believed that commemorating Mr. Lu Xun was a "disaster," and "joining those gentlemen in commemorating the dead is extremely boring."

This is Hu Feng.

When Japanese imperialism was still frantically invading China, and when the Kuomintang reactionaries were intensifying their anti-communist and anti-people activities, Hu Feng's struggle was directed against the literary movement led by the Chinese Communist Party. He used publications like "Hope" as his base, encouraging the members of his small group to "coexist with the base." In order to establish "coordinated strongholds," he did not hesitate to introduce others to edit supplements in reactionary newspapers. In order to arrange the power of his small group, he wanted to reach out to various places (such as the Northeast, Tianjin...). He wanted to write one miscellaneous essay under a different name each time, saying it could "spread flags all over the mountains" and "create a suspicious formation."

This is Hu Feng.

"Taking from others to feed oneself," "taking the world as one's responsibility," "all things are prepared in me," "feeling the real subjectivity in operation, a great will runs through China."

This is Hu Feng.

I had never finished reading a poem or article by Hu Feng before because I couldn't understand it and didn't know what it was talking about. Recently, after laboriously reading Hu Feng's "Opinions" submitted to the Party Central Committee, I understood the reason for my past incomprehension. The reason is that Hu Feng deliberately mystified things under the guise of Marxism. Peel off the outer garment, and you can faintly, no, clearly see the mystery inside. For example, the "five knives" are clearly visible from the opposite side. After reading the materials published by Shu Wu this time, Hu Feng's open and hidden arrows became even clearer, and between the lines, I could hear his voice and see the person, because it was skinned and there was no concealment of the "private words" of "do not mention to outsiders." What is placed before everyone is such a selfish, hypocritical, insidious, cowardly, and extremely dark soul.

I really hope that Hu Feng's "we" will provide more materials to peel off the ghost mask more thoroughly, and even peel off the "self-criticism" skin that Hu Feng newly put on, so that he is naked and exposes all his privacy.

　　黑暗的灵魂
　　吴伯箫
    舒芜剥了胡风一层皮，胡风原形毕露了。“文艺理论家”，“诗人”，招牌多么堂皇！一旦揭去假面，却是这样一副丑恶面貌。
    文学家原应是“人类灵魂的工程师”，但照舒芜材料里所揭露的，那样的文学家是对“灵魂的工程师”这个称号的极大污辱。对人民呼为救星的共产党，对大家都感到亲热的党的同志，胡风是采取了敌对态度的。他用最恶毒的字眼来咒骂党，咒骂党的同志。胡风称进步的文艺工作者为“蛆虫”
  “市侩”，他要“警戒他们……用微笑包着侮蔑和他们握手言欢……”，他要用“一种用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”来“回敬”批评了“论主观”的人们，认为那是“打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”的“好方法”。他把端午节纪念伟大的爱国诗人屈原说成“为诗人们跳加官”。他认为纪念鲁迅先生是“灾难”，是“与那些诸公合伙纪念死人，无聊之至”。
    这就是胡风。
    在日本帝国主义还在疯狂地侵略中国的时候，在国民党反动派正加紧反共反人民的时候，胡风斗争的矛头是针对中国共产党所领导的文艺运动的。他用“希望”那样的刊物作阵地，鼓动他小集团的成员“与阵地共存亡”。为了建立“配合的小据点”，不惜介绍别人在反动报纸上编副刊。为了布置小集团的势力，他要向各地（像东北、天津……）伸手。写杂文要每篇一名，说是可以“遍山旗帜”“布得成疑阵”。
    这就是胡风。
    “拿别人养活自己”，“以天下为己任”，“万物皆备于我”，“感到了真的主观在运行，一个大的意志贯穿了中国”。
    这是胡风。
    我从前没读完过胡风的一篇诗文，因为看不懂，不知里边在说些什么。最近吃力地读了胡风提给党中央的“意见书”，知道了过去不懂的原因。原因是胡风在马克思主义外衣的掩盖底下故弄玄虚。剥开外衣，就能隐隐约约，不，明明显显看出那里边的奥秘。譬如“五把刀子”，从反面看去就是明晃晃的。这次读了舒芜发表的材料，胡风的明枪暗箭就更清楚了，字里行间，如闻其声，如见其人，因为是剥了皮的缘故，是毫无掩藏的“勿与外人道及”的“私房话”的缘故。摆在大家面前的是这样一个自私、虚伪、阴险、卑怯，极其黑暗的灵魂。
    真希望胡风的“我们”提供更多的材料，把鬼画皮再剥得彻底些，连胡风新披上的“自我批判”的皮也给他剥掉，让他一丝不挂，把全部隐私晾出来。
