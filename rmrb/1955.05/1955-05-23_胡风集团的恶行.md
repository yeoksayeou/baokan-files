　　The Evil Deeds of the Hu Feng Clique
　　Wei Jinzhi
    For the past four or five years, I have often thought: the Hu Feng problem is definitely not just a problem of literary and artistic thought; but what exactly is the problem? I couldn't quite put my finger on it. This time, Shu Wu's exposure made the concept of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique immediately clear to me.
    I knew Hu Feng before the War of Resistance; however, I only came into ideological contact with him after Liberation. After Liberation, the Shanghai Literary Association ran a supplement called "Literary World" in Wenhui Daily. A poem by Ji Fang was published in this supplement. Readers had opinions about this poem and wrote letters one after another. Since the readers had opinions, the editorial board naturally had to express its attitude. At that time, the editorial board members all offered their opinions, and Xue Feng was entrusted to write a response. After it was written, it was given to Hu Feng to take a look at. It would have been better if Hu Feng hadn't looked at it, but as soon as he saw that his crony was being "harmed," he flew into a rage, picked up a red pen, and struck seventeen or eighteen heavy lines through the manuscript. In order to maintain the interests of his clique, Hu Feng's tyranny was even worse than that of a warlord.
    During the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun," the Hu Feng clique immediately seized this opportunity to launch a fierce attack: on the one hand, they told Zhang Yu to continuously submit articles to the Literary Gazette, repeatedly demanding that the leading comrades of the Shanghai literary and artistic work Party make self-criticisms; on the other hand, other Hu Feng elements in Shanghai incited opposition to the leading comrades of the literary and artistic work Party; they tried their best to turn this serious ideological struggle into a personal attack on the leading comrades of literature and art.
    At that time, the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles mobilized everyone to study in order to improve the ideological level of all literary and artistic workers in this criticism. This angered the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, and Luo Shi and others came out to oppose it.
      Mei Lin, the executive editor of "Literary World," published these two articles opposing the study in "Literary World." Their reasons for opposing were: Wu Xun had already been judged by Mr. Lu Xun, and studying him was unnecessary. Moreover, they said that this was forcing the compilers' and reviewers' own responsibilities onto everyone else. The editorial board members were very dissatisfied with this matter; Mei Lin not only did not accept criticism, but also planned to publish Luo Shi's counter-criticism article. If "Literary World" had not been suspended, this erroneous article would definitely have been published.
    In short, whenever the cultural circles launched an ideological criticism, the Hu Feng clique would carry out large-scale activities, seize certain excuses, and exaggerate certain shortcomings in the work, in order to achieve the despicable goal of attacking the Party and winning over people. This was the case during the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun," and the Hu Feng anti-Party clique's conspiracy was the same during this inspection of the Literary Gazette.
      After "Literary World" was suspended, the Standing Committee of the Literary Association proposed a literary and artistic publication to guide young people, designated me as the editor-in-chief, but still invited Mei Lin to be an editorial board member. However, he resolutely refused. Others felt that this publication could not be allowed to be dominated by the Hu Feng faction, and also expressed their slacking off and resistance. This youth literary and artistic publication was ultimately aborted due to the sabotage of the Hu Feng clique. What the Hu Feng clique needed was a publication that could publish their absurd remarks; even a clumsy supplement like "Current Affairs News" was acceptable to them, but they were unwilling to cooperate with the publications run by the Literary Association that could serve the broad masses of the people, and instead wanted to dismantle them in every possible way. From this, we can see how rampant and domineering the Hu Feng anti-Party clique was, and how it endangered the growth of new literature and art. Haven't they committed enough evil?
    Just as Beijing was about to carry out literary and artistic rectification, Hu Feng ran to Shanghai. According to Hu Feng himself, he came to Shanghai to participate in the Shanghai literary and artistic rectification. But heavens, he was not here to participate in literary and artistic rectification at all; on the one hand, he came to Shanghai to avoid the wind, and on the other hand, he came to Shanghai to rectify others. At that mobilization meeting, I saw with my own eyes him sitting leisurely at the entrance and exit of the venue, gesturing and instructing his clique members for a while, and going to the corridor to drink tea for a while.
    As for the group meetings, Hu Feng looked even more leisurely. When he was in the mood, he would expound his "grand theories," which were the old tune of self-expansion, that is, self-transformation; on the one hand, he flaunted himself, and on the other hand, he used it to teach others a lesson. At that time, our vigilance was really not high enough. Although we felt that this person was strange, we did not see that he was using the name of rectification to spread the evil wind of the bourgeoisie!
    In more than ten group meetings, Hu Feng, this solitary and self-important "dignitary," only came three times.
    I was the group leader of this group. Of course, I had to ask him why he didn't come to the meeting, since there was such a frivolous member in the group. According to the secretary, Hu Feng was already writing a self-criticism and was very busy. Since he was very busy, we naturally had to be especially lenient and let him come if he wanted to, and not come if he didn't. However, a day or two passed, a week or two passed, and we neither saw Hu Feng's shadow nor saw Hu Feng's self-criticism. We only heard that Hu Feng's inspection report had already been written for more than 10,000 words, and had not yet been completed, so naturally we had to wait again. But Hu Feng's inspection report was really too long, so long that the literary and artistic rectification was declared over, and even at the summary meeting of the literary and artistic rectification, we had not seen a word of his self-criticism. Later, we couldn't even see Hu Feng's shadow. It turned out that the rumor that Hu Feng was writing a self-criticism was just a cover, a trick to escape!
    Where did Hu Feng go? Hu Feng went to Beijing!
    Although Hu Feng went to Beijing, Hu Feng's cronies in Shanghai were even more active in Shanghai. Hu Feng had his agents in the Party, and thanks to the vigorous organization of this agent, Liu Xuewei, a large number of Hu Feng elements entered the New Literature and Art Publishing House. At this time, the slogan "Liu Xuewei on the head, New Literature and Art under the feet" circulated in the Shanghai literary and art circles. Because I had said that Mr. Lu Xun had also rushed to complete tasks, Hu Feng's crony Zhang Yu wrote an article to oppose it, and even launched a personal attack on me. Because Xue Feng divided Mr. Lu Xun's thought into early and late stages, Hu Feng's backbone in Shanghai—Geng Yong—made unreasonable demands and insisted that Mr. Lu Xun was a communist from the beginning; because the "Literary Monthly" published articles criticizing him, Hu Feng element Gu Zhengnan wrote to question the "Literary Monthly," saying that the "Literary Monthly" had not published his article supporting Geng Yong, and even complained directly to the Central Propaganda Department. This is the main reason why Hu Feng advocated canceling the "Literary Monthly" in his opinion attachment.
    We were too 麻痹 in the past, and often overlooked something quite important in situations that did not concern us. Not only did we overlook it in the past, but we also found some unfounded reasons to cover up our negligence. Thanks to this discussion of the Hu Feng issue, I finally remembered many of Hu Feng's previous evil deeds. Now I will attach a summary here for reference in discussing the Hu Feng issue!
    That was after the War of Resistance, when Hu Feng returned to Shanghai. In order to revive his "Hope," Hu Feng had openly solicited external shares. We outsiders don't know how many external shares were solicited, but according to our understanding, Hu Feng has never cleared them up since "Hope" ceased publication. If "Hope" could truly serve the people and the revolution, I would not want to raise this issue. But since Hu Feng's publication does not serve the people and the revolution, then it is very likely to have the nature of "petty bourgeois" fraud, and I must raise it.
    A little earlier than this, when Hu Feng had already returned to Shanghai, Xue Feng was still in Chongqing. One day I met Mr. Xu Guangping. Mr. Xu told me about Xue Feng's recent situation. She said that Xue Feng had many shortcomings, which Hu Feng had told her. Later, Xue Feng returned to Shanghai, and I saw that he was still the same as before. And Hu Feng still often went to Xue Feng's place to stay, and it looked like they were still talking and laughing. Isn't this Hu Feng sowing discord? Does such an insidious person have any basic morality?
    It is really very painful for me to recall so many past events. As a person, a literary writer, his important task is to improve his own cultivation in all aspects so that he can better serve the revolution and the people. But Hu Feng's deliberate plans are to oppose the Chinese Communist Party and the broad masses of the Chinese people who lead the Chinese revolution, and his only purpose is to establish his unspeakable clique, which is really hateful.

　　胡风集团的恶行
　　魏金枝
    这四五年来，我常常这样想：胡风的问题，决不只是什么文艺思想上的问题；但到底是什么问题呢？又说不上来。这次舒芜的揭发，使我对胡风反党集团的概念立刻明确起来了。
    我和胡风认识，是在抗战以前；可是和他在思想上相接触，却在解放以后。解放后，上海文协在文汇报上办了一个“文学界”副刊。在这副刊上登了一首冀汸的诗。读者对这诗有意见，纷纷来信。读者既然有意见，编委会自然得表示态度。当时编委都提了意见，托雪峰去写。写好了，又交胡风去看一下。胡风不看犹可，一见“损害”了他的喽罗，便大发雷霆，拿起红笔，在文稿上打了十七八根大杠子，胡风为了维护他的集团利益，其横暴真比军阀统治还要厉害。
    在批判“武训传”的时候，胡风集团立即抓住这一机会，展开猛烈的进攻：一方面叫张禹接连在文艺报投稿，一再要求上海文艺工作党的领导同志作检讨；另一方面，其他的胡风分子就在上海鼓动反对文艺工作党的领导同志；他们竭力打算把这场严肃的思想斗争，变为对文艺领导同志的人身攻击。
    那时上海文联为了使全体文艺工作者能在这次批判中提高思想水平，动员进行学习。这就触怒了胡风反党集团，便有罗石等人出来反对。
      “文学界”的执行编委梅林，便将这两篇反对学习的文章，登载在“文学界”上。他们反对的理由是：武训这个人，早由鲁迅先生作了定评，学习是多事。而且说，这是把编制者和审定者自己的责任硬套到大家的身上去。编委们对这事很不满意；梅林不但不接受批评，而且还打算将罗石的反批评文章再发表。要不是“文学界”停刊，这篇错误的文章就一定会发表了。
    总之，凡是文化界展开一次思想批判，胡风集团就要大肆活动，抓住某些借口，夸大某些工作上的缺点，来达到攻击党，争取人的卑鄙目的。在批判“武训传”的时候如此，在这次检查文艺报工作中，胡风反党集团的阴谋也是如此。
      “文学界”停刊后，文协常委会又提议出一个指导青年的文艺刊物，指定我主编，但仍请梅林做编委。可是他决然拒绝了。另有些人，感到这刊物不能让胡风派为所欲为，也表示怠工和抗拒。这个青年文艺刊物，到底因为胡风集团的破坏而流产了。胡风集团所需要的是能够发表其荒谬言论的刊物，即使像“时事新报”那样龉龊的副刊，他们也可以降格以求，但对于文协所办的刊物，可以为广大人民服务的刊物，却不愿合作，而要多方拆台。从这里看出胡风的反党集团如何横行霸道，危害着新文艺的成长。他们作的恶还算少吗？
    正当北京要进行文艺整风时，胡风跑到上海来了。据胡风自己说，他是来参加上海文艺整风的。可是天呀，他哪里是来参加文艺整风的，他一方面到上海来是避风，一方面却是到上海来整别人的。在那一次动员会上，我亲眼看见他悠闲地坐在会场的进出口边，一会儿给他的集团分子指手划脚指示一通，一会儿到走廊上去喝喝茶。
    至于在小组会上，胡风面孔还要悠闲得多。碰上他来了兴，他就发挥他的“宏论”，就是那套自我扩张，也就是自我改造的老调；一方面是夸示自己，一方面用以教训教训别人。当时我们的警觉性实在太不高了，虽然感到这个人死样怪气，但没有看出来他正是借整风之名，在散布资产阶级的恶风！
    在十多次小组会上，胡风这个独往独来的“显贵”只来了三次。
    我是这个组的小组长，组里有这样一个吊儿郎当的组员，当然要去问问他为什么不来开会。据秘书说：胡风已经在写检讨，很忙。既然很忙，自然只好格外容情，让他要来则来，不来则罢。然而一天两天过去了，一星期两星期也过去了，既不见胡风的影子，也看不见胡风的检讨书。只是听说胡风的检查报告已经写了一万多字，还没有写完，于是自然只好再等。但胡风这个检查报告，实在写得太长了，以至于文艺整风宣告结束，甚至在文艺整风的总结大会上，还没见到他的检讨书的一个字。后来连胡风的影子也看不到了。原来所传胡风在写检讨书，不过是一个掩护，玩弄他的金蝉脱壳之计！
    胡风上哪里去了，胡风上北京去了！
    胡风虽然上了北京，胡风在上海的那批喽罗，在上海活动得更厉害。胡风在党内有他的代理人，由于这个代理人刘雪苇的大力组织，大批地吸收了胡风分子进入了新文艺出版社。这时，上海文艺界便流传着“头顶刘雪苇，脚踏新文艺”的口号。因为我说过鲁迅先生也赶过任务的话，胡风的喽罗张禹，就著文反对，以至对我进行人身攻击。因为雪峰把鲁迅先生的思想分为前后期，胡风在上海的骨干之一——耿庸，就无理取闹地硬说鲁迅先生一开头就是共产主义者；因为“文艺月报”登载了别人批评的文章，胡风分子顾正南来信质问“文艺月报”，说“文艺月报”没有登载他的拥护耿庸的文章，还直接向中央宣传部告状。这就是为什么胡风在他的意见书附件中所以主张要把“文艺月报”一并取消的主要原因。
    我们过去太麻痹，在事不关己的情况下，常常把某种颇为重要的东西忽略了。不但忽略过去，而且还找些毫无根据的理由，来掩护自己的疏忽。由于这次胡风问题的讨论，到底使我想起了好多胡风以前的恶行。现在择要附记在这里，以便作为讨论胡风问题的参考吧！
    那是抗战以后，胡风回到上海的时候。胡风为了恢复他的“希望”曾经公开地招收过外股。这批招收来的外股，数目究竟是多少，我们外人不得而知，可是根据我们了解，自从“希望”停刊以后，胡风却不曾清理过。假使“希望”能真正为人民和革命服务，我不想提出这个问题来。但胡风的刊物既不为人民和革命，那就很有“市侩”们欺诈取财的性质，我就非得把它提出来不可。
    比这更早一点的时候，那时胡风已回到上海，雪峰却还留在重庆。有一天我碰到许广平先生。许先生就和我说起雪峰的近况。说到雪峰好些不是的地方，说是胡风告诉她的。后来雪峰回到上海来，我看他还是从前的样子。而胡风也还是常到雪峰住的地方去，看样子还是有说有笑的。这不是胡风从中挑拨离间么？这样阴险的人，还有一点起码的道德吗？
    我来回忆这样的许多往事，实在非常痛苦。作为一个人，一个文艺作家，他的重要的任务，是在于怎样提高自己的各方面的修养，能够更好地为革命为人民服务。但是胡风的处心积虑，却是反对领导中国革命的中国共产党和中国广大人民，而其唯一的目的，就是建立他的不可告人的集团，说来实在叫人愤恨。
