　　“New Times” Magazine Publishes Article
　　Discussing the Economic Benefits to the People of Many Countries from the Implementation of Soviet Disarmament Proposals
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 21st: The newly published 21st issue of "New Times" magazine published an article by Menshikov, discussing the economic benefits to millions of people from the implementation of Soviet disarmament proposals.

The article pointed out that the expansion of armaments by Western countries in recent years has brought fatal consequences to the economies and living conditions of many countries. From the 1950 fiscal year to the 1955 fiscal year, the direct military expenditure alone in the US federal budget has increased more than threefold, Britain's military expenditure has almost doubled, and France's has increased 3.4 times. The vast majority of these military expenditures are taken from taxes paid by residents.

The article said that the people of many countries are groaning under the burden of expanding armaments and the "Cold War." It is time to end the Cold War. The new Soviet disarmament proposals call for this.

Implementing the Soviet proposal to greatly reduce armaments and armed forces would first reduce non-productive consumption. According to statistics, if the Soviet disarmament proposals were implemented, the money saved from the French military budget would be enough to produce an additional four million tons of coal, 69,000 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower), 600 million bottles of milk, 750,000 bicycles, build 60,000 three-room houses, 1,600 schools, and 18,000 kilometers of roads each year.

Implementing the Soviet proposal to reduce the size of armed forces means greatly reducing the burden of taxation. If the United States correspondingly reduces its appropriations for maintaining the army, navy, and air force, then taxes could be reduced by 14 to 20 billion US dollars; Britain could reduce 300 million pounds; France could reduce 275 billion francs. In Britain, the money saved could be used to build at least 300,000 three-room houses each year, partially solving the housing shortage that ordinary Britons are currently very troubled by. In the United States, the increased income for residents would be enough to buy half as much food again.

The article concludes by saying that reducing armaments means greatly alleviating the burden on the people of all countries. This is why the new Soviet disarmament proposals put forward on May 10th have aroused extremely enthusiastic and positive responses all over the world.

　　“新时代”杂志发表文章
　  论述实现苏联裁军建议对许多国家人民的经济的好处
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：新出版的第二十一期“新时代”杂志上发表了曼希科夫写的一篇文章，论述实现苏联的裁军建议对于千百万人们的经济上的好处。
    文章指出，西方国家几年来的扩张军备已经给许多国家的经济和人民的生活条件带来了致命的后果。从一九五零财政年度到一九五五财政年度这段时间内，美国联邦预算中仅仅直接军事费用一项的支出就增加到三倍以上，英国的军事费用差不多增加到两倍，法国增加到三点四倍。这些军事费用的绝大部分取之于居民交纳的税款。
    文章说，许多国家人民在扩张军备和“冷战”的重担下呻吟。现在是该结束冷战的时候了。苏联的裁军新建议在这方面作了号召。
    实行苏联所提出的大大裁减军备和武装部队的建议，首先就会使非生产性的消耗减少。据统计，如果实行了苏联提出的裁军建议，从法国军事预算中缩减出来的钱，就足够每年多出产四百万吨煤，六万九千台拖拉机（以十五匹马力计算），六亿瓶牛奶，七十五万辆自行车，可以建筑六万所三个房间的住宅，一千六百所学校，一万八千公里的公路。
    实行了苏联所提出的关于裁减武装部队数量的建议，就意味着大大地减轻赋税的负担。美国如果相应地缩减维持陆海空军方面的拨款，那末赋税就可以减少一百四十亿至二百亿美元；英国可以减少三亿英镑；法国可以减少二千七百五十亿法郎。在英国，用缩减下来的这笔款项每年至少可以建造三十万所三个房间的住宅，在一定程度上解决普通英国人目前十分感到烦恼的房荒问题。在美国，居民增加的收入款项足够多买一半的粮食。
    文章最后说，裁减军备就意味着大大减轻各国人民的负担。这就是为什么苏联五月十日提出的裁军新建议在全世界各地引起极为热烈的积极响应的原因。
