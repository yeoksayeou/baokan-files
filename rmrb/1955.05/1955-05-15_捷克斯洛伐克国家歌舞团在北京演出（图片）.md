　　The "Farm Work" dance is from eastern Slovakia. This dance depicts the joy of women sowing, harvesting, and celebrating the harvest in the fields. Our reporter Gao Liang (高粮) took the photo.
　　"The Landlord and the Ghost" is a dance drama adapted from mythology. In most Czechoslovak folk tales, ghosts are not scary but symbols of justice. This dance drama depicts an arrogant landlord who provokes the anger of the entire village. The people hope the ghost will catch him, so the ghost sends the landlord to hell. The dance drama expresses the working people's boundless hatred for the feudal rulers. Our reporter Gao Liang (高粮) took the photo.
　　"Kubura" dance. Our reporter Yuan Yiping (袁毅平) took the photo.
　　The Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble's wonderful performances in Beijing have further strengthened the mutual understanding between the people of China and Czechoslovakia. This is a scene from the Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble performing the "May Day" dance at the open-air theater of the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing. Our reporter Yuan Yiping (袁毅平) took the photo.

　　According to the Sino-Czechoslovak Cultural Cooperation Agreement, the Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble, invited to visit our country, performed beautiful folk music and dances from various parts of Czechoslovakia in Beijing.

　　捷克斯洛伐克国家歌舞团在北京演出
    “农作”舞是斯洛伐克东部的舞蹈。这个舞蹈描述妇女在田野里播种、收割和丰收的愉快。　本报记者　高粮摄
　　“大老爷和鬼”是根据神话改编的舞剧。在捷克斯洛伐克大部分的民间故事中，鬼怪并不是可怕的，而是正义的象征。这个舞剧中所描写的是一个盛气凌人的大老爷，激起全村人民的愤怒。人民希望鬼来把他抓走，于是鬼就把大老爷送进了地狱。舞剧表现了劳动人民对封建统治者的无比憎恨。
