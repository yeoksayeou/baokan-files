Anhui Province, which ranks third in the nation in tea production, is experiencing smooth progress in its tea procurement work. As of around May 20th, the procurement of export black tea has reached 81% of the annual target, and export green tea has reached 50%. The first batch of refined tea for export has already arrived in Shanghai. The procurement of tea for domestic sales is also better than in previous years. The total amount of tea procured in the province has increased by 34% compared to the same period last year. The spring black tea procurement work has now basically concluded, and the procurement of summer tea will begin in half a month; green tea is currently in its peak picking season, and procurement work is still proceeding intensely. Although tea plants in Anhui Province suffered severe frost damage last winter, due to the emphasis placed on the leadership of tea production by Party and government leading bodies in various localities this spring, and the vigorous promotion of inter-tillage, fertilization, and improved picking and processing techniques, the losses from frost damage have been largely compensated. Therefore, this year's tea procurement tasks can be completed according to plan.

　  安徽茶叶收购工作顺利进行
    茶叶产量占全国第三位的安徽省，茶叶收购工作顺利进行。截至五月二十日左右，外销红茶已完成全年收购计划的百分之八十一，外销绿茶已完成百分之五十。第一批外销的精制茶已经运抵上海。内销茶的收购工作也较往年为好。全省茶叶收购数量比去年同期增加百分之三十四。春季红茶收购工作现已基本结束，半月以后将开始收购夏茶；绿茶正在采摘旺季，收购工作仍在紧张进行中。安徽省茶棵在去年冬季遭受严重冻害，但因今春各地党、政领导机关都重视对茶叶生产的领导，大力提倡了中耕、施肥，改进采制技术，所以，在很大程度上弥补了冻害的损失。因此今年茶叶的收购任务可以按计划完成。
