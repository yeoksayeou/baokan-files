N.A. Bulganin Delivers Opening Speech at the All-Union Conference of Industrial Workers

　　Soviet Premier N.A. Bulganin delivered the opening speech on the 16th at the All-Union Conference of Industrial Workers held in Moscow.

　　N.A. Bulganin said that this conference was convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the government to discuss measures for further developing industry based on the widespread adoption of scientific and technological achievements and advanced experiences in production.

　　Socialist industry, as the leading sector of the national economy, is advancing along a path of continuous upsurge. The development speed of our industry, especially the development speed of heavy industry, is several times faster than that of several major capitalist countries.

　　This year, industrial output will increase by approximately 80 percent compared to 1950, which is more than three times the pre-war level of 1940. The Fifth Five-Year Plan for developing our industry is being successfully implemented in terms of quantitative targets, and there is now ample reason to believe that the Fifth Five-Year Plan will be overfulfilled.

　　Bulganin said that the issues to be discussed at this conference are extremely important for the country. Only by applying the latest achievements of science and technology in production—the foundation of technological progress—can we ensure the rapid improvement of labor productivity, which, according to Lenin's definition, is ultimately the most important and principal condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system.

　　In the past twenty-six years, the labor productivity in our country has increased more than sixfold.

　　To ensure the further development of the national economy, it is necessary to increase labor productivity to a new level. This task can only be accomplished through the continuous and resolute application of new equipment and advanced technologies, through modernizing existing machinery and equipment, and through fundamentally improving the organization of production.

　　Machine manufacturers bear a particularly significant responsibility in the development and adoption of new technologies and the improvement of labor productivity in the national economy. Machine manufacturers influence the country's technological progress in two ways. On the one hand, machine-building factories themselves adopt new technologies and improve labor productivity when manufacturing machines and equipment; on the other hand, they design and produce machines that can ensure the technological progress of the entire national economy.

　　Bulganin further pointed out that Soviet metallurgical workers and chemical workers should play an important role in striving for the country's technological progress and improving labor productivity.

　　Although the metallurgical and chemical industries have made some achievements in adopting new technologies, both industries lag behind international technical levels in some products.

　　Bulganin continued by saying that the improvement of labor productivity depends not only on the quantity and level of existing equipment but also on the rational use of this equipment.

　　He said that the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet Council of Ministers correctly pointed out that the backwardness in adopting advanced technologies is due to the complacency and arrogance of many workers in industry, to their loss of a sense of responsibility for the work entrusted to them by the country, and to the loss of foresight and direction in technical policy. Some workers have forgotten the Party's instructions: it is necessary to consistently improve technology; without technological improvement, it is impossible to develop socialist production.

　　We live in an era of very rapid development of science and technology, in the age of atomic energy. Today, more than ever before, life demands that leaders and engineering and technical personnel in industry be good at correctly assessing and applying the latest achievements, and be good at foreseeing the further development of science and technology. However, there are still some leaders in industry who would rather produce and use outdated technologies than bother to master and promote new, more advanced technologies and progressive operating methods.

　　Bulganin said: While adopting new technologies, we must certainly not forget the old technologies. We cannot discard all the old equipment and machines at once and replace them with new ones. We must modernize this equipment and these machines so that they can be used more effectively.

　　The adoption of new technologies must be for the benefit of the country and must be of the greatest benefit to the national economy. We must not separate technology and economics. Every time a new piece of equipment is adopted, economic considerations, calculations, and preliminary tests are required, and this is often forgotten.

　　Bulganin also said that the adoption of advanced technologies and the improvement of production organization must not be considered in isolation from the people who carry out production. Without the broad participation of workers, technicians, engineers, designers, and process technicians, without the consistent and creative cooperation of workers in science and production, nothing can be accomplished.

　　Socialist competition has always played, and will continue to play, a huge role in improving labor productivity and mastering new technologies.

　　The main task of socialist competition at present is to widely promote the experience and achievements of advanced workers in production. However, production innovators and advanced workers have not received the support they deserve, their working methods are not promoted sufficiently, and have not become the property of the masses.

　　Bulganin then spoke about the organization of production.

　　Bulganin said that in the organization of production, we must pay special attention to the rhythmic work of enterprises and the use of internal potential. The Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet Council of Ministers believe that the non-rhythmic work of industrial enterprises is an unsightly and intolerable phenomenon.

　　Bulganin pointed out that the shortcomings in the organization of production are also reflected in the management structure of enterprises. The Party and the government demand that bureaucratic leadership styles in offices be resolutely eradicated, that administrative personnel be reduced, that administrative work be improved, and that leadership be improved. It is necessary to improve factory management structures, to eliminate unnecessary links, and to merge small workshops and departments. Bulganin continued by saying that we have no doubt that in the economic competition between the two social systems, the more progressive socialist system will inevitably triumph. However, everyone knows that victory will not come on its own; victory is organized and created by people. In order to defeat capitalism in the economic competition, we must have advanced technology, better production organization, and higher labor productivity.

　　We have many examples of entire enterprises whose personnel are working very well, and who have achieved high labor productivity, reduced production costs, and produced high-quality products due to the adoption of new technologies and the improvement of production organization.

　　By promoting the experience of outstanding figures and innovators in science and production, and by improving the leadership of socialist competition, we will also be able to rapidly increase output, improve product quality, and reduce costs in the future, achieving continuous technological progress and further improving labor productivity. Our country has the conditions to accomplish these tasks.

　　Bulganin said that further development of the national economy requires improvement of national planning work. Therefore, the Central Committee and the government have put forward some measures aimed at improving national planning work and the adoption of new technologies in the national economy. A decision has been made to reorganize the Soviet State Planning Committee. The main reason for the reorganization is the task of fundamentally improving the long-term planning work of the Soviet national economy. In this regard, it has been decided to separate the work of drafting long-term plans for the development of the national economy from the current planning work for achieving a certain goal. On the basis of the current State Planning Committee, the State Committee for Long-Term National Economic Planning of the Soviet Council of Ministers (Soviet State Planning Committee) and the Economic Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers for Current National Economic Planning (Soviet Economic Committee) will be established.

　　At the same time, it has been decided to establish a State Committee responsible for the adoption of new technologies to guide and coordinate the work of various ministries in this regard. Other measures are also being prepared.

　　Finally, Bulganin asked the participants to focus on the following issues that the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet Council of Ministers consider particularly important:

　　1. Develop and promote advanced technologies as soon as possible, improve process regulations and production organization, so as to greatly improve labor productivity.

　　2. Better utilize existing equipment and production sites.

　　3. Strengthen national discipline. The current task is to require all enterprises to complete and over fulfill this year’s (the last year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan) national plan according to all indicators.

　　4. Reduce administrative management personnel in industry and reduce administrative expenses.

### 在全苏工业工作人员会议上　尼·亚·布尔加宁致开幕辞

　　在全苏工业工作人员会议上
　　尼·亚·布尔加宁致开幕辞
    苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁，十六日在莫斯科举行的全苏工业工作人员会议上致开幕辞。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁说道，我们这次会议是由共产党中央委员会和政府召开的，目的是讨论在生产中广泛采用科学和技术成就以及先进经验的基础上进一步发展工业的措施。
    作为国民经济领导部门的社会主义工业正在沿着不断高涨的道路前进。我们工业的发展速度、特别是重工业的发展速度比几个主要资本主义国家的工业的发展速度快几倍。
    今年，工业产量将比一九五零年大约增加百分之八十，即为战前一九四零年的三倍以上。发展我们工业的第五个五年计划在数量指标方面正在胜利地执行着，并且现在有充分的理由可以认为，第五个五年计划将超额完成。
    布尔加宁说，要在这次会议上讨论的问题对于国家是十分重要的。只有在生产中应用科学和技术的最新成就——技术进步的基础——才能保证劳动生产率的迅速提高，而劳动生产率，根据列宁的定义，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要的、最主要的条件。
    在过去二十六年中，我们国家的劳动生产率提高到六倍以上。
    为了保证国民经济的进一步发展，必须把劳动生产率提高到新的水平。只有通过不断地和坚决地应用新设备和先进技术，通过使现有的机器和设备现代化并且根本改进生产组织，才能完成这一任务。
    在国民经济中发展和采用新技术并提高劳动生产率方面，机器制造者负有特别重大的责任。机器制造者在两方面影响着国家在技术上的进步。一方面是机器制造工厂本身在制造机器和设备时采用新技术和提高劳动生产率，另一方面是设计和生产可以保证整个国民经济技术进步的机器。
    布尔加宁进一步指出，苏联的冶金工作者和化学工作者应在争取国家的技术进步和提高劳动生产率方面起重要的作用。
    虽然冶金和化学工业在采用新技术方面取得了某些成就，可是在某些产品方面，这两种工业都落后于国际技术水平。
    布尔加宁继续说道，应当说，劳动生产率的提高不仅取决于现有装备的数量和水平，而且还取决于这些装备的合理的使用。
    他说，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议正确地指出了在采用先进技术方面的落后现象是由于工业中许多工作人员的自满和骄傲，是由于他们丧失了对国家委托给他们的工作的责任感，是由于在技术政策上丧失了前途和方向。有一些工人忘记了党的指示：必须始终一贯地提高技术，没有技术的提高要发展社会主义生产是不可能的。
    我们生活在科学和技术非常迅速地发展的时代，生活在原子能的时代。今天，生活比以前任何时候更要求工业中的领导人员和工程技术人员善于正确地估计和采用最新成就，善于预见科学和技术的进一步的发展。但是，工业中还有这样一些领导人员，他们宁愿生产和使用陈旧的技术而不愿意费神来掌握和推广新的、更先进的技术和进步的操作方法。
    布尔加宁说：我们在采用新技术的同时当然一定不能忘记旧技术。我们不能一下子把所有的旧设备和机器都丢掉而用新的来代替。必须把这些设备和机器现代化以便更有效地使用。
    新技术的采用必须为国家利益着想，要对国民经济有最大好处。一定不能把技术和经济分割开来。每采用一种新设备都要求作经济上的考虑、核算和初步试验，而这一点时常被忘记了。
    布尔加宁又说，采用先进的技术和改善生产组织一定不能和进行生产的人们孤立起来考虑。没有工人、技术人员、工程师、设计师和工艺技师们的广泛参与其事，没有科学和生产方面的工作者们的一贯的、创造性的合作，什么事也完成不了。
    社会主义竞赛一直、并且以后也将在提高劳动生产率和掌握新技术方面起着巨大的作用。
    目前社会主义竞赛的主要任务是，广泛地推广生产中的先进工作者的经验和成就。但是生产革新者和先进工作者没有得到应得的支持，他们的工作方法推广得不够，没有成为群众的财产。
    布尔加宁接着谈到生产的组织问题。
    布尔加宁说，在生产组织方面，我们必须特别注意企业的有节奏的工作和内部潜力的使用。共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议认为，工业企业的不按节奏的工作是一种不雅观的、不能容忍的现象。
    布尔加宁指出，生产组织中的缺点也反映在企业管理机构中。党和政府要求坚决根除办公室的官僚主义的领导作风、裁减行政人员、改进行政工作和改善领导。必须改善工厂管理机构，必须取消不必要的环节，并合并小车间和部门。布尔加宁继续说，我们毫不怀疑，在两种社会制度的经济竞争中，更进步的社会主义制度必然胜利。然而大家知道，胜利不会自己到来的，胜利是人们去组织和造成的。为了在经济竞赛中战胜资本主义，我们必须有先进的技术、更好的生产组织和更高的劳动生产率。
    我们有许多整个企业的人员都工作得很好的例子，他们由于采用了新技术以及改进了生产组织而取得了很高的劳动生产率，降低了生产成本并且生产了质量高的产品。
    通过推广科学和生产中的优秀人物和革新者的经验，提高社会主义竞赛的领导水平，我们在将来也将能够迅速增加产量，改进产品质量和降低成本，取得不断的技术进步和进一步提高劳动生产率。我们的国家有完成这些任务的条件。
    布尔加宁说，进一步发展国民经济要求改进国家计划工作。因此，中央委员会和政府提出了一些旨在改进国家计划工作和国民经济中对新技术的采用的措施。已经作出决定改组苏联国家计划委员会。进行改组的主要原因是要根本改进苏联国民经济的长期计划工作这一任务。在这方面，已经决定把草拟发展国民经济的长期计划的工作同目前为达到某一目的的计划工作分开，在目前国家计划委员会的基础上，将成立苏联部长会议负责长期国民经济计划工作的国家委员会（苏联国家计划委员会）和苏联部长会议负责目前国民经济计划工作的经济委员会（苏联经济委员会）。
    同时已决定成立一个负责采用新技术的国家委员会，来指导和调配各部在这方面的工作。其他的措施也正在准备中。
    最后，布尔加宁要求与会者集中注意苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议认为特别重要的下列问题：
    一、尽早发展和推广先进技术，改善工艺规程和生产组织，以便大大提高劳动生产率。
    二、更好地利用现有设备和生产场地。
    三、加强国家纪律、当前的任务是要求各企业按照各方面的指标完成和超额完成今年（第五个五年计划的最后一年）的国家计划。
    四、裁减工业中的行政管理人员并减少行政开支。　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科十七日电）
