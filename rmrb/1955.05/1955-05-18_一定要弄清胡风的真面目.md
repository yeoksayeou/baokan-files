　　We Must Clarify Hu Feng's True Colors
　　Wu Zuxiang
    The "People's Daily" published excerpts from Shu Wu's exposure of Hu Feng's correspondence on May 13th, which was shocking and infuriating to read!

    It turns out that for many years, as early as during the Anti-Japanese War under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, Hu Feng considered his mortal enemy and great foe not Japanese imperialism and the reactionary forces of the US and Chiang Kai-shek, but the Chinese Communist Party and the cultural front and literary ranks led by the Party. He called the Chinese Communist Party "the official," and the Party's literary workers "the dignitaries," "mandarin gowns," and "masters"; he called revolutionary and progressive literary friends "young masters," "petty merchants," and "maggots"; and regarded himself as a "beast" in the revolutionary cultural camp. The martyr Wen Yiduo, under the call and influence of the Party, made a heroic and fearless sacrifice for the just struggle for people's democracy. The people of the whole country mourned in unison and paid unanimous respect. However, Hu Feng viciously slandered him as a "speculative" and "ugly character"! Hu Feng called all cultural activities with significant struggle significance under the dark fascist rule at that time "mixing with maggots" and "dancing Jia Guan." The great Lu Xun, wasn't he the one he claimed to follow and admire? What kind of struggle activity was the Lu Xun memorial meeting in Chongqing at that time? Didn't Hu Feng know? But he deliberately thought it was "a disaster for me," saying "commemorating the dead is extremely boring"!

    Please take another look at Hu Feng's "tactics" and "strategies" against the cultural camp led by the Party, which he regarded as a mortal enemy. What kind of ghostly tricks were they?

    When the Party's working comrades treated him as a friend and gave well-intentioned advice and criticism on the reactionary theories promoted by his group, he cunningly discussed and planned "to consider the approach," "to strengthen the strength," saying, "In the future, before writing, we must first become masters, and then fight with ourselves who have become masters, while preventing them from not understanding and preventing them from constituting a crime." He meanly instructed: "It's better to be calm for a while," "The tone is colder, that is, more contemptuous," "Because of our unfavorable situation, we should be especially cautious and not underestimate the enemy." He evilly incited: "There is a kind of whip wrapped in steel wire to beat prisoners, which injures them but does not show scars on the surface. I think it is a good method." Saying, "This is not only to seize the banner, but also it is difficult to obtain confessions or accusations of weight without doing so."

    Like all villains who are at odds with the public, he is always afraid of his loneliness and weakness. He cried out in despair: "We must greatly strengthen our strength." He racked his brains to "contact people" and "win people over," furtively inquiring: "Who do you think are the targets?" He is also as stubborn as all evildoers. Knowing that "the enemy is very powerful," and that he will eventually be defeated, he still encourages the young people under his bewitchment and deception, saying: "We must also meet them head-on, and we must have the determination to coexist with the position." Saying: "I am most afraid of the depression of my friends," "Let's walk while bleeding, we must not lose heart!" "We must not relax, we must be determined to launch a year-long charge." He also cunningly and proudly thought: "Essays, very interesting... What's even better is that each article has a different name, so that I can set up a suspicious array, so that they will see flags all over the mountains and dare not easily attack. How happy is this! Before the collection is compiled, I hope you will not tell outsiders about it."

    Since ancient times, gangsters and counter-revolutionaries have used some good names as a cover, but in fact, for their own selfish desires, they can do anything in the end. Haven't we always believed that Hu Feng had fought against the Kuomintang's reactionary fascist culture and stood on the side of the progressive political camp before liberation? However, there is such a passage in the materials exposed by Shu Wu this time: In 1946, Hu Feng introduced a person to edit the supplement "Shudao" of the "Xinshu Bao". Hu Feng clearly knew, he said: "Firstly, that newspaper is very bad, and secondly, I don't know what tricks he will play." He also cunningly and embarrassedly said: "They want manuscripts, and they want me to write them," "I can't refuse, so I have to promise to write a little, but please allow me to change the name. He said, no! Look, how can this be! This is all my fault for being nosy. Not only can I not get a small base for coordination in strategy, but I have also created trouble. If I don't handle it well, I will add to the attackers' materials." Following this, there is another passage: In the same year, Hu Feng extremely meanly used other people's names to edit the supplement for the Kuomintang reactionary newspaper "Shishi Xinbao". He shamelessly said to his young subordinates: "This newspaper has a bad political stance," but at the same time actively solicited manuscripts. Please see, isn't this very clear: After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, just when the people of the whole country were fighting to the death with the reactionary forces of the US and Chiang Kai-shek, he was willing to hide and join the US-Chiang Kai-shek agents "in order to obtain a small base for coordination in strategy"! We also remember that in his recent public speech, he boldly deceived the world and falsely claimed that Shu Wu's character was bad and politically unreliable. Look at what kind of face this is!

    In March 1950, after the national liberation, Hu Feng was still ambitiously and conspiratorially planning: "There (Northeast), in terms of culture, is a new area, where we can get rid of all personal relationships and engage in pioneering work. I am afraid it is better than anywhere else." "The Shanghai literary world is dominated by several powerful figures... Beijing is too crowded, and Wuhan and Hunan seem to be clueless... The Northeast does not have this pressure (or very little), and it is close to Tianjin. Tianjin's literary movement is very active, and Lu Li and others are in charge, which is very promising." What exactly is Hu Feng planning and scheming here? What exactly does the "work" and "future" he said here refer to? We cannot but suspect!

    In the criticism movement against Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought, we only stripped off his "Marxist" coat, but he is still wearing the disguise of a progressive cultural figure who was once in the democratic camp, which makes it impossible to see through his anti-revolutionary true colors at once; in his "My Self-Criticism" published in the same day's "People's Daily", he still claims to be something like "the revolutionary and standpoint of the petty bourgeoisie", etc. These can still continue to deceive society and confuse the public. We firmly advocate "beating a drowning dog" and firmly oppose "knowing when to stop" and "not going too far"; the problem must be thoroughly clarified, and we cannot tolerate such masked people still swaying in our people's literary and art ranks today!

### 一定要弄清胡风的真面目

　　一定要弄清胡风的真面目
　　吴组缃
    五月十三日“人民日报”揭载了舒芜暴露的关于胡风的通信的摘录，读了之后令人非常惊骇和愤恨！
    原来一直多年来，早在抗日战争时期的国民党反动政权统治下，胡风认作自己的死敌和大仇的，倒不是日本帝国主义和美蒋反动势力；而是中国共产党和党所领导的文化阵营与文艺队伍。他称中国共产党为“官方”，称党的文艺工作者为“权贵”，为“马褂”，为“老爷”；称革命的进步的文艺界朋友为“公子们”，为“市侩”，为“蛆虫”；而把自己看做革命文化阵营里的一头“猛兽”。闻一多烈士在党的号召和影响下，为争取人民民主的正义斗争，作了英勇大无畏的牺牲，这是全国人民同声痛悼，一致肃敬的，但胡风竟丧心病狂地诬蔑为
  “投机”的“丑的角色”！胡风把在当时黑暗的法西斯统治下的具有重大斗争意义的文化界活动，一律叫做“混在蛆虫里面”“跳加官”；伟大的鲁迅，不是他宣称自己所追随和崇敬的么，在当时的重庆开鲁迅纪念会是怎样一种意义的斗争活动，胡风难道不知道么，但他竟别有用心地认为“对我是灾难”，说是“纪念死人，无聊之至”！
    请再看看胡风对于他视作不两立的死敌的党所领导的文化阵营的“战法”与“战略”，是怎样一些鬼蜮伎俩吧：
    当党的工作同志把他当作友人，对他的集团所宣传的反动理论进行善意的规劝和批评时，他却狡狯地商量计划着“要考虑作法”，“要加强实力”、说“以后得在下笔前先变成老爷们，再来和变成了老爷们的自己作战，一面防止他们不懂，一面防止他们构成罪案”。他卑鄙地指使着：“暂时沉着
  一点的好”，“口气冷一点，也就是更轻蔑一点”，“由于我们处境的不利，就应该特别谨慎，不能轻敌的”。他狞恶地教唆着说：“有一种用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕，我以为是好方法。”说“这不但是为了把大旗抓到手里，而且不如此就难得招供或控诉底重量”。
    正像一切与众为敌的恶棍一样，他时时为自己的孤独和力量薄弱而危惧。他绝望地叫着：“非大大地加强实力不可。”他处心积虑地想“联络人”、
  “争取人”，鬼鬼祟祟地打听：“你以为有哪一些
  对象呢？”他也像一切恶徒一样地顽强，明知“敌
  人却是非常强大的”，自己终将溃灭的，还是对他
  的被蛊惑被愚弄的手下青年人鼓动着说：“也只有
  迎上去，而且非抱着与阵地共存亡的决心不可。”说：“顶怕朋友们底消沉”，“一面流血一面走罢，泄气不得”！“松不得劲，我们要决心打一年冲锋”。他还狡诈地自以为得意：“杂文，甚有趣。……更好的是每篇一名，使我布得成疑阵，使他们看来遍山旗帜，不敢轻易来犯，快何如之。成集之前，望勿与外人道及。”
    自来流氓匪棍、反革命分子，都会利用一些好名目做幌子，实则为了一己的私欲，到头可以无所不为的。我们不是一直认为胡风曾对国民党反动的法西斯文化作过斗争，在解放前站在进步的政治阵营方面的么？可是这次舒芜揭露的材料里却有这样一条：一九四六年胡风介绍一个人去编
  “新蜀报”的副刊“蜀道”。胡风明明知道，他说：“一来那个报坏得很，二来不知道他会弄出什么花头来”。他又狡诈地狼狈地说：“要稿子，而且要我非写不可”，“无法谢绝，只好答应写一点，但请他允许换一个名字。他说，不行！你看，这如何得了！这又怪我多事，不但不能在战略上得一配合的小据点，反而弄出了麻烦，弄得不好就要增加攻击者们底材料。”跟着还有一条：在同年，胡风又极端卑鄙地用了别人的名字去为国民党反动报纸“时事新报”编副刊，他无耻地对他的手下青年说：“这个报政治立场不好”，但同时积极地拉稿子。请看，这不是很明白么：在抗日战争胜利之后，正当全国人民与美蒋反动势力作殊死斗争的时候，他却“为在战略上得一配合的小据点”，就心甘情愿躲躲藏藏地投身到美蒋特务那边去了！我们还记得最近他在公开的发言中还斗胆欺世，反说舒芜品质不好，政治上靠不住。请看这是怎样一付嘴脸！
    在全国解放以后的一九五○年三月间，胡风还在野心勃勃、阴谋诡计地盘算着：“那里（东北），在文化上是新区，可以摆脱一切人事关系，从事开辟工作，恐怕比任何地方都好。”“上海文坛被几个猛人驰骋着……北京太挤，武汉、湖南似乎茫无头绪……东北没有这个压力（或者很薄），且与天津接近。天津文运很活泼，鲁藜等主持，很有前途。”胡风这里盘算计划的究竟是什么？他这里说的“工作”与“前途”究竟何指？我们不能不怀疑！
    在对胡风文艺思想的批判运动中，我们只剥掉他的“马克思主义”的外衣，但他身上还披着曾经是民主阵营进步文化人的伪装，使人不能一下子看透他反对革命的真面目；在同日“人民日报”刊登的他的“我的自我批判”中，他还口口声声以什么
  “小资产阶级的革命性和立场”等等自居，这些，仍然可以继续蒙骗社会，淆惑视听的。我们坚决主张“打落水狗”，坚决反对“适可而止”和“不为己甚”；问题必须搞个彻底，我们不能容忍这样一些带假面具的人还在今日我们的人民文艺队伍里摆来摆去！
