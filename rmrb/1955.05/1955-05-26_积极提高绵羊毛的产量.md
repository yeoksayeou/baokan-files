　　Actively Increase Mutton Wool Production
　　Gao Shaocheng
    China is one of the countries in the world that produces the most mutton wool. China has many varieties of mutton wool, including Lanhaha wool, Merino wool, Corriedale wool, Tziga wool, Han wool, and Tong wool suitable for weaving high-quality wool fabrics and serge; Xining wool and Tibetan wool with high tensile strength and elasticity, suitable for weaving carpets, plush, and serge; and Hexi wool, North China wool, Fine Carded wool and Huzhou wool suitable for weaving various bed blankets and general wool fabrics; as well as Yingzi wool, Hada wool, and Loose Carded wool with good luster, high elasticity, and a high reputation in the international market, suitable for weaving felt blankets.
    Before liberation, under the rule of imperialism and domestic reactionary forces, the vast number of farmers and herdsmen suffered cruel oppression and exploitation, and animal husbandry suffered severe damage. In 1949, the national mutton wool production was only about 50% of the highest annual production before the War of Resistance Against Japan. After liberation, the Party and the government's policy of protecting and developing animal husbandry was implemented. State-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives vigorously purchased wool at reasonable prices every year. The number of sheep raised across the country has greatly increased. In 1954, the national mutton wool production reached the highest level in Chinese history, and the lives of farmers and herdsmen have also been greatly improved.
    Mutton wool is one of China's main export commodities. Every 225 jin of mutton wool exported can be exchanged for 2,000 jin of steel; exporting 20 million jin of mutton wool can be exchanged for a factory the size of the Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant.
    At present, the method of collecting wool in some areas of China is still relatively backward. The amount of wool produced per sheep is only between two and three jin, while the unit wool production of ordinary sheep in the Soviet Union is more than ten jin, and the highest can reach thirty jin. If the unit wool production of Chinese sheep is increased by one jin on the existing basis, it will be possible to exchange for six 25,000-kilowatt thermal power plants from abroad in one year. Therefore, agricultural and pastoral departments in various regions should actively promote advanced Soviet experience and improve sheep breeds in a planned way. At the same time, wool exports should be expanded. Currently, more than 20% of the mutton wool produced nationwide is consumed by farmers and herdsmen themselves, and the rest is supplied to the domestic wool textile industry. If farmers and herdsmen across the country can save half of the mutton wool they consume themselves, they can exchange for 1,000 tractors from abroad in one year.

### 积极提高绵羊毛的产量

　　积极提高绵羊毛的产量
　　高少澄
    我国是世界上出产绵羊毛最多的国家之一。我国的绵羊毛品种很多，有适合纺织上等毛织品和呢绒哔叽的蓝哈羊毛、美利奴毛、考利黛毛、茨盖毛、寒羊毛、同羊毛；有拉力大、弹性大、适合于纺织地毯、长毛绒和呢绒哔叽的西宁毛和西藏毛；也有适合纺织各种床毯和一般呢绒的河西毛、华北毛、细抓毛和湖羊毛等；还有光泽好、弹力大，在国际市场上负有盛名，适合织毡毯用的营字毛、哈达毛、散抓毛等。
    解放前，在帝国主义和国内反动势力的统治下，广大农牧民都受着残酷的压迫和剥削，畜牧业受到严重的摧残。一九四九年，全国绵羊毛产量仅及抗日战争前最高年产量的百分之五十左右。解放后，执行了党和政府保护和发展畜牧业的方针，国营商业和合作社每年都以合理的价格大力收购羊毛，全国绵羊的饲养数目有了很大的发展，一九五四年全国绵羊毛的产量已达到我国历史上的最高水平，农牧民的生活也大大地改善了。
    绵羊毛是我国主要出口商品之一。每出口二百二十五斤绵羊毛，就能换回两千斤钢材；出口两千万斤绵羊毛，就能换回和鞍钢无缝钢管厂一样规模的一座工厂。
    目前我国某些地区取毛办法还较落后，每只绵羊的产毛量只在二斤至三斤之间，而苏联一般绵羊的单位产毛量都是十斤以上，最高的能达到三十斤。如果将我国绵羊的单位产毛量在现有基础上提高一斤，一年就能向国外换回六个二万五千瓩的火力发电厂。所以各地农牧部门应积极推广苏联先进经验，有计划地改良羊种。同时，应扩大羊毛出口。目前全国所产的绵羊毛，百分之二十以上由农牧民自己消费掉了，其余部分是供给国内毛纺织工业使用的。如果全国农民牧民能将自行消费的绵羊毛节省一半，一年即能向国外换回一千部拖拉机。
