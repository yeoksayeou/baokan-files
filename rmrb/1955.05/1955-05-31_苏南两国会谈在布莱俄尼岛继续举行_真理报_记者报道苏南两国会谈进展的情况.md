Xinhua News Agency, Brioni Island, May 29th: Khrushchev, Bulganin, Mikoyan, and other members of the Soviet government delegation, at the invitation of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, left Belgrade on a special train on the evening of May 28th to come to Brioni Island.

President Tito, Kardelj, Ranković, other members of the Yugoslav government delegation, and Soviet delegation members traveled on the same special train. Accompanying the two delegations were their advisors, experts, and Soviet and Yugoslav journalists.

At Karlovac, the final station of the special train, the guests were welcomed by representatives of the local authorities and the local command.

The Soviet government delegation, together with the Yugoslav government delegation and their entourages, traveled by car from Karlovac to Pula on the Adriatic coast, and then by sailboat to Brioni Island.

The Soviet guests and Yugoslav leaders were warmly welcomed by residents of villages and cities along the way. At various train stations along the route from Belgrade to Brioni, despite the early morning and continuous rain, the special train was greeted by residents who welcomed the guests with applause and cheers.

As the cars carrying the Soviet guests and Yugoslav leaders passed through Rijeka, a center for shipbuilding and oil refining; Opatija, a resort city; Pazin; Raša, a mining city; and other cities and residential areas along the Adriatic coast, they were welcomed by residents lining the streets. The residents expressed their sincere sympathy for the Soviet people and their desire to strengthen Yugoslav-Soviet friendship and consolidate world peace.

During their stay on Brioni Island, the two delegations will continue to exchange views on issues in the Soviet-Yugoslav negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 30th: "Pravda" correspondents in Belgrade, Yu. Zhukov and V. Mayevsky, published an article on May 30th entitled "Soviet-Yugoslav Talks Progress in a Spirit of Full Mutual Understanding."

The reporters wrote, when talking about the Soviet and Yugoslav delegations going to Brioni Island, that the two government delegations, after concluding the first stage of talks in Belgrade, are now beginning an extensive tour of the country. This tour was initiated by Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav side emphasized that the tour would allow the Soviet government delegation to understand the situation in Yugoslavia and to see how friendly the Yugoslav people are towards the Soviet Union.

The Soviet and Yugoslav delegations held three talks at the Guard House in Belgrade. Yugoslav newspapers today pointed out that these three meetings were the first stage of the negotiations, and that this stage has ended successfully.

"Politika" and other Yugoslav official newspapers, in commenting on the progress of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks, emphasized that the talks are developing smoothly. Yugoslav newspapers speculated that the outcome of the talks will be a joint Soviet-Yugoslav document, which will set forth the common views of both sides on extremely important international issues and Soviet-Yugoslav relations issues. The article went on to say that Belgrade political figures, in discussing the prospects for mutual relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, expressed the hope that the two sides would not look back on the past, but would work together to develop bilateral relations, in order to further strengthen cooperation and consolidate friendship.

The Soviet side expressed satisfaction with the course of the talks. These talks were conducted in a spirit of full mutual understanding. Since the talks have not yet concluded, it is too early to assess the results achieved, but the exchange of views that has already taken place has proven that such talks are beneficial and appropriate.

The article also pointed out that a warm and friendly atmosphere prevailed at the reception held by President Tito for the Soviet government delegation. Only certain American journalists showed dejection and anger because they saw that their predictions about the very pessimistic prospects of the talks, which they had been desperately promoting last week, had not materialized. These journalists filled their newspapers with all sorts of lies about the process of the talks, with the sole purpose of misleading people and creating suspicion. However, the facts show that this conspiracy did not succeed.

Regarding the visit of the Soviet and Yugoslav delegations to the Adriatic coast, the reporter pointed out: in every city, every village, and every workers' town, all the residents came out to greet the Soviet and Yugoslav delegations. Happy people applauded and cheered continuously, waving bouquets. Throughout the country, just as in Belgrade, the news of the further normalization of Soviet-Yugoslav relations was deeply satisfying.

    苏南两国会谈在布莱俄尼岛继续举行
    “真理报”记者报道苏南两国会谈进展的情况
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社布莱俄尼岛二十九日讯：赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁、米高扬和苏联政府代表团的其他团员应南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的邀请在五月二十八日晚间乘专车离开贝尔格莱德到布莱俄尼岛来。
    铁托总统、卡德尔、兰科维奇以及南斯拉夫政府代表团其他团员和苏联代表团一起乘同一专车前来。随这两国代表团同来的还有它们的顾问们、专家们和苏联及南斯拉夫的记者们。
    在这列专车的终点站卡罗发兹，客人们受到地方当局和当地司令部的代表们的欢迎。
    苏联政府代表团同南斯拉夫政府代表团和它们的随员们从卡罗发兹乘汽车到亚得里亚海沿岸的普拉市，然后从那里乘帆船到布莱俄尼岛。
    苏联客人们和南斯拉夫领袖们在沿途到处都受到乡村和城市居民的热烈欢迎。在从贝尔格莱德到布莱俄尼沿线的各个火车站上，尽管是在清早而且霪雨连绵，但是这列专车还是受到居民的欢迎，居民们以鼓掌和欢呼来欢迎客人们。
    苏联客人们和南斯拉夫领袖们乘坐的汽车驶过造船和炼油工业中心利吉卡，休养城市奥巴提亚，帕津，矿业城市拉沙和亚得里亚海沿岸的其他城市和居住区的时候，受到居民的夹道欢迎。居民表示了他们对苏联人民的真挚的同情和他们希望加强南斯拉夫同苏联的友谊以及巩固世界和平的愿望。
    两国代表团在布莱俄尼岛逗留的期间，将继续就苏联同南斯拉夫谈判中的问题交换意见。
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”驻贝尔格莱德记者尤·茹科夫和弗·马耶夫斯基三十日发表了一篇文章，题目是“苏联—南斯拉夫谈判在彼此充分谅解的精神中获得进展”。
    记者谈到苏联和南斯拉夫代表团前往布莱俄尼岛一事时写道，两国政府代表团在结束在贝尔格莱德举行的谈判的第一阶段后，现在开始在国内作广泛旅行。这次旅行是根据南斯拉夫的倡议而举行的。南斯拉夫方面强调指出，旅行将使苏联政府代表团了解南斯拉夫的情况，并且可以看到南斯拉夫人民对苏联是采取多么友好的态度。
    苏联和南斯拉夫代表团在贝尔格莱德近卫军大厦举行了三次会谈。南斯拉夫报纸今天指出这三次会议是谈判的第一阶段，这一阶段已经胜利结束了。
      “政治报”和南斯拉夫的其他机关报评述苏南谈判的进程时着重指出，谈判获得顺利的发展。南斯拉夫报纸推测说，谈判结果将拟定苏联和南斯拉夫的联合文件，这一文件将写下双方对极其重要的国际问题以及苏联—南斯拉夫关系问题的共同观点。文章接着写道，贝尔格莱德政界人物在谈到苏联和南斯拉夫之间的相互关系的远景时，表示希望双方不要回顾往事，而要共同努力发展两国关系，以便进一步加强合作和巩固友谊。
    苏联方面对会谈的过程表示满意。这些会谈是以充分互相谅解的精神进行的。由于会谈还没有结束，现在对于已经达成的结果作出估计还嫌过早，但是已经举行的交换意见的情况，已经证明了这种会谈是有益的和适宜的。
    文章还指出，在铁托总统为苏联政府代表团举行的招待会上，笼罩着热烈和友好的气氛。只有某些美国新闻记者表现出垂头丧气和愤怒，因为他们看到他们在上星期拚命宣传的关于会谈前途非常悲观的预测并没有成为现实。这些记者们在自己的报纸上填满了关于会谈过程的各种谎言，唯一的目的就是使人不明真相和发生怀疑。但是，事实说明，这种阴谋没有得逞。
    记者就苏联和南斯拉夫的代表团访问亚得里亚海岸一事指出：在每一个城市、每一个农村和每一个工人村镇中，所有的居民都出来迎接苏联和南斯拉夫的代表团。欢乐的人们不断鼓掌欢呼，摇着花束。在全国各地，就像在贝尔格莱德一样，对苏联和南斯拉夫关系将进一步正常化的消息深为满意。
