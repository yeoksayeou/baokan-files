　　The Principle of Collective Self-Defense Cannot Be Distorted
　　Dù Bō
　　The great achievements of the Asian-African Conference have been universally praised by just public opinion in countries around the world, and have had a broad and profound impact on international affairs. This has made the American aggressive bloc, which attempts to dominate the world, extremely alarmed and uneasy. Therefore, it is doing its utmost to distort the words and spirit of the Asian-African Conference Communiqué, hoping to continue to create divisions and antagonism from here, and to cover up its aggressive activities.
    The American aggressive bloc particularly viciously attempts to use the provisions on collective self-defense in the Declaration on Promotion of World Peace and Cooperation to defend the many military aggressive blocs it has organized. The United States and its followers insist that the provisions on collective self-defense in the declaration are suitable for "defensive alliances such as the Atlantic Treaty and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," and "do not hinder" countries participating in these military blocs. They deceive these countries by saying that participating in these American military aggressive blocs "does not serve the special interests of any major power, but rather their own defensive security." However, the United States and its followers' deliberate distortion of the Asian-African Conference's principle of collective self-defense precisely exposes their own guilty conscience. Even in those countries that have joined American military blocs, some public opinion does not believe this kind of nonsense. The Karachi "Today's News" in Pakistan wrote on April 28:
  "The Asian-African Conference itself is the best example of peaceful coexistence. Countries participating in the military blocs planned by the United States against the Soviet Union and China should reconsider whether their policies conform to the spirit of the Asian-African Conference resolution regarding not serving the special interests of major powers."
    The provisions of the Asian-African Conference on collective self-defense cannot be allowed to be distorted. The fifth principle of the declaration stipulates: "Respect for the right of each nation to defend itself individually or collectively in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations." According to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, any country can only exercise the right of individual or collective self-defense when it is subjected to an act of armed aggression. The reason for this provision is to prevent anyone from following the old ways of Japanese militarism and organizing and launching aggression in the name of "self-defense." At the same time, the sixth principle of the declaration stipulates that "collective defense arrangements shall not be used to serve the particular interests of any one of the great powers" and that "no country should exercise pressure on other countries." This is even more to prohibit major powers from using the name of "collective self-defense" to drag small countries into their military aggressive blocs to serve their interests. Do the so-called North Atlantic Treaty and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, etc., have anything in common with these provisions of the Asian-African Conference?
    Neither the North Atlantic Group nor the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, etc., can be said to have any "self-defense" nature at all. They are all aggressive blocs organized by the United States, imitating Japanese militarism, in the name of self-defense or defense, in preparation for launching wars. At the time of the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty, there was no act of armed attack or threat in Europe at all. On the contrary, the American aggressive bloc openly admitted that the North Atlantic Treaty was to prepare to attack the Soviet Union and launch a new war. The deceased former Republican Senate leader Taft said: "The North Atlantic Group has become an old-fashioned military alliance... What we are attempting is actually to arm the whole world against communist Russia." Now, the United States is forcing Western European countries to pass the Paris Agreements, reviving the aggressive West German militarist forces and dragging them into the North Atlantic Group. In this way, the aggressive nature of this group is even more obvious. As for the establishment of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, it was precisely after the Geneva Conference reached the Indochina Armistice Agreement. At that time, the situation in Asia and the world was beginning to ease, and there was even less talk of the so-called threat of armed attack. The purpose of the United States in establishing this military bloc was of course not for "self-defense," but to undermine peace in Indochina and maintain the tense situation in the Far East.
    In order to find arguments for its establishment of aggressive blocs, the United States has always tried in vain to describe these aggressive blocs as regional organizations that conform to the Charter of the United Nations. However, the North Atlantic Group and the Southeast Asia Group, etc., are not even regional organizations in form. The North Atlantic Group can include not only Mediterranean countries like Italy and Greece, which are not connected to the North Atlantic, but even Asian countries like Turkey, which are not at all related to the North Atlantic. As Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson boasted in Paris on May 11: "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has completed a circle around the world." What kind of regional organization is this? Wouldn't it be more correct to call it a global aggressive organization? Only three Asian countries participate in the Southeast Asian military bloc. The United States and the other four countries that dominate this group do not belong to Asia at all. The vast majority of Southeast Asian countries have refused to participate in this military bloc. What is this called a regional organization? Wouldn't it be more in line with the facts to call the Southeast Asia Group an aggressive bloc of colonial countries?
    Article 52 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that regional organizations should strive for peaceful resolution of disputes occurring locally. However, the North Atlantic Group and the Southeast Asia Group, as well as other aggressive organizations, are pursuing other goals. Under the control of the United States, the North Atlantic Group obstructs the peaceful reunification of Germany, supports West German war forces, equips West Germany with atomic weapons, and uses it as a tool for them to launch aggressive wars. Various proposals by the Soviet Union for a peaceful resolution of the German issue have been rejected by the United States. The Soviet Union has several times last year suggested to the United States, Britain, and France in the North Atlantic Group to jointly discuss the establishment of a European collective security issue, and has expressed its willingness to consider together with the countries concerned the issue of the Soviet Union's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty, but it was also rejected by Western countries. The Southeast Asia Group is trying to undermine the Geneva Conference's peace agreements on Indochina and is determined to drag Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam into this organization. The recent military and intelligence organization meetings held in Baguio and Bangkok are preparing to establish an aggressive army and intensify intelligence and subversive activities in Southeast Asian countries, interfering in the internal affairs of various countries. These military blocs have never intended to seek a peaceful resolution to international problems; on the contrary, they are dedicated to creating and expanding disputes. The United States' activities in organizing military blocs in the Middle East are an example. It can be seen that the military blocs created by the United States are clearly established by the United States to create divisions, create tensions, and prepare for war. They have nothing in common with the interests and wishes of the people of these regions.
    The North Atlantic Group and the Southeast Asia Group were both created by the United States using various pressures to serve the United States' aggressive interests. They are by no means for the interests of the participating countries themselves. The United States uses these aggressive organizations to occupy the lands of various countries as its naval and air force bases, control the armies of various countries, interfere in the internal affairs of various countries, and strive to use Asians to fight Asians and Europeans to fight Europeans in the war it is preparing. Even major Western powers such as Britain and France cannot but be restrained by the United States. It is well known that the French National Assembly approved the Paris Agreements by a narrow majority, which was only passed under great pressure from the United States. At the recent Southeast Asia Group military conference held in Baguio, the United States exerted great pressure on Thailand to turn Thailand into a US military aggressive base, so that the Thai representative attending the meeting also complained that Thailand was not suffering from the communist "aggression" danger, "Thailand does not need the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization army to strengthen Thailand's defense forces." In the Middle East, the United States is trying to force countries such as Syria, Iran, and Afghanistan to join the Middle East military bloc and accept US control, although some countries have already expressed their refusal.
    These facts show that the North Atlantic Group and the Southeast Asia Group and other aggressive organizations planned and controlled by the United States fundamentally violate the United Nations Charter and are completely contrary to the Asian-African Conference's provisions on collective self-defense. It is obviously impossible for the United States to try to distort the Asian-African Conference Declaration to conceal its acts of aggression.
    Organizations that fully comply with the principles of the United Nations Charter on collective self-defense do exist. This is the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance recently concluded by eight European countries. As everyone knows, the North Atlantic Group and its so-called "Western European Union" countries, regardless of the efforts of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving European countries to seek peace, are rearming West Germany, trying their best to prepare to launch an atomic war, and do not hesitate to say that the war is aimed at the Soviet Union and the European People's Democratic countries. In order to deal with this war threat, the eight countries, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, exercise the right of individual or collective self-defense, automatically organize themselves, strengthen their defense forces, and defend peace. This is very necessary.
    The Eight-Nation Treaty fully complies with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and is also reflected in many other specific provisions. For example, the treaty stipulates that it will jointly guarantee that it will not threaten or use force in international relations, but will advocate the use of peaceful methods to resolve international disputes, which is consistent with the spirit of Article 52 of the United Nations Charter that regional organizations should strive for peaceful resolution of international disputes. The Eight-Nation Treaty stipulates that other European countries can join this treaty, and hopes to establish a European collective security system on the basis of the participation of all European countries to jointly guarantee European peace. Once the European security system is established, the Eight-Nation Treaty will automatically become invalid. The contracting parties continue to advocate taking effective measures for universal disarmament, banning atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction to ensure peace.
    These characteristics of the Eight-Nation Treaty prove that it is a peaceful treaty and is of a completely defensive nature. It is a clear contrast to the North Atlantic aggressive group and the Southeast Asian aggressive group and other military organizations planned and controlled by the United States. Who is maintaining peace and who is engaging in aggressive war is very clear. Although the United States is trying to distort the Asian-African Conference's principle of collective self-defense to conceal its activities of organizing aggressive blocs, the facts prove that it can only be in vain.

　　集体自卫的原则不容曲解
　　杜波
　　亚非会议的巨大成就，得到全世界各国公正舆论的普遍赞扬，对国际事务产生了广泛而深远的影响。这使得妄图独霸世界的美国侵略集团非常惊恐不安。因此，它竭力曲解亚非会议公报的文字和精神，希图从这里继续制造分歧和对立，并掩盖它的侵略活动。
    美国侵略集团特别恶毒地企图利用关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言中有关集体自卫的规定，来为它所组织的许多军事侵略集团作辩护。美国及其追随者硬说，宣言中关于集体自卫的规定，适合于
  “像大西洋公约和东南亚条约组织之类的防御联盟”，对参加这些军事集团的国家“并没有妨碍”。他们欺骗这些国家说，参加美国的这些军事侵略集团“不是为任何大国的特殊利益服务，而是为了它们本身的防御安全”。但是，美国和它的追随者这样故意曲解亚非会议关于集体自卫的原则，恰恰暴露了他们自己做贼心虚。就是在那些参加了美国军事集团的国家里，有的舆论也不相信他们这种鬼话。巴基斯坦喀喇蚩“今日报”四月二十八日就写道：
  “亚非会议本身就是和平共处的最好例证。参加美国所策划的反对苏联和中国的军事集团的国家，应该重新考虑它们的政策是否合乎亚非会议决议中关于不为大国特殊利益服务的规定的精神。”
    亚非会议关于集体自卫的规定不能容许曲解。宣言的第五项原则规定：“尊重每一个国家按照联合国宪章单独地或集体地进行自卫的权利”。按照联合国宪章第五十一条的规定，任何国家只有在遭受到武力攻击的侵略时，才能行使单独的或集体的自卫权利。其所以要这样规定，就是为了防止有人学日本军国主义的老样，用“自卫”的名义来组织和发动侵略。同时，宣言的第六项原则规定“不使用集体防御的安排来为任何一个大国的特殊利益服务”，“任何国家不对其他国家施加压力”。这更是为了禁止大国利用“集体自卫”的名义把小国拉入它的军事侵略集团去为它的利益效劳。难道所谓北大西洋公约和东南亚条约组织等等和亚非会议的这些规定有任何相同之处吗？
    无论北大西洋集团或东南亚条约组织等等都丝毫说不上有什么“自卫”性质。它们都是美国仿效日本军国主义用自卫或防御的名义组织起来准备发动战争的侵略集团。在北大西洋公约成立的时候，欧洲根本没有什么武力攻击或威胁的事发生。正相反，倒是美国侵略集团彰明昭著地承认，北大西洋公约是为了准备进攻苏联，发动新的战争。已死的前美国共和党参议院领袖塔夫脱就说过：“北大西洋集团已成为一个旧式的军事联盟……。我们所企图的，实际上就是要武装全世界以反对共产主义的俄国。”现在，美国又逼迫西欧国家通过巴黎协定，把侵略成性的西德军国主义势力复活起来，并把它拉入北大西洋集团。这样，这个集团的侵略性质就更加明显了。至于东南亚侵略集团的成立，正是在日内瓦会议达成印度支那停战协定之后。那时亚洲和世界局势正在开始缓和，更谈不到所谓遭受武力攻击的威胁。美国成立这个军事集团的目的，当然不是为了“自卫”，而是为了要破坏印度支那和平，保持远东紧张局势。
    为了要替它成立侵略集团寻找论据，美国总是枉费心机想把这些侵略集团说成是区域性组织说成是符合于联合国宪章的。但是，北大西洋集团和东南亚集团等等，甚至在形式上也不是什么区域性的组织。北大西洋集团不仅可以包括意大利、希腊这样同北大西洋连不到一起的地中海国家，甚至还有土耳其这样根本同北大西洋毫不相关的亚洲国家。正如加拿大外长皮尔逊五月十一日在巴黎所吹嘘的：“北大西洋公约组织已经完成了围绕世界的圆圈”。这究竟是一个什么样的区域性组织呢？难道把它叫做全世界性的侵略组织不更正确些吗？参加东南亚军事集团的统共只有三个亚洲国家。支配这个集团的美国和其他四个国家根本不属于亚洲。绝大多数的东南亚国家都拒绝参加这个军事集团。这叫做什么区域性组织呢？如果把东南亚集团叫做殖民国家的侵略集团岂不是更合乎事实些吗？
    联合国宪章第五十二条规定，区域性组织对当地发生的争端，应力求和平解决。但是，北大西洋集团和东南亚集团以及其他侵略性组织，却追求着另外的目的。北大西洋集团在美国的控制下，阻挠德国的和平统一，扶植西德战争势力，用原子武器把西德装备起来，作为它们发动侵略战争的工具。苏联提出各种和平解决德国问题的建议，都被美国所拒绝。苏联在去年曾经数次向北大西洋集团中的美英法三国建议共同讨论建立欧洲集体安全的问题，并曾表示愿意同有关各国共同考虑关于苏联参加北大西洋公约的问题，但是也被西方国家拒绝了。东南亚集团则力图破坏日内瓦会议关于印度支那的和平协议，硬要把老挝、柬埔寨和南越拖进这个组织。最近在碧瑶、曼谷举行的军事和特务组织会议，更准备建立一支侵略军队，并加紧在东南亚国家进行特务颠覆活动，干涉各国内政。这些军事集团从来不打算谋求国际问题的和平解决，相反，它倒是专门致力于制造争端和扩大争端。美国在中东组织军事集团的活动就是一个例子。由此可见，美国所制造的军事集团明明白白是美国为了制造分裂、制造紧张局势、准备战争而成立起来的。它们同这些地区人民的利益和愿望没有丝毫共同之处。
    北大西洋集团和东南亚集团都是美国千方百计使用各种压力搞起来，为美国的侵略利益服务的。它们决不是为了参加国本身的利益。美国利用这些侵略组织占据各国的土地作为它的海空军基地，控制各国军队，干涉各国的内政，力谋在它所准备的战争中用亚洲人打亚洲人，用欧洲人打欧洲人。甚至连英国和法国这样的西方大国，也不能不受美国的扼制。人所共知，法国国民议会以微弱的多数批准巴黎协定，就是在美国巨大压力下才通过的。最近在碧瑶举行的东南亚集团军事会议上，美国就曾对泰国施加强大压力，要把泰国变成美国的军事侵略基地，以至泰国出席这个会议的代表也抱怨说：泰国并没有遭受共产党的“侵略”危险，“泰国并不需要东南亚条约组织军队来加强泰国的防御力量。”在中东，美国正力图压迫叙利亚、伊朗和阿富汗等国家参加中东军事集团，接受美国的控制，虽然有些国家早已表示拒绝。
    这些事实说明，美国策划和控制的北大西洋集团和东南亚集团以及其他侵略组织，根本违反联合国宪章，也同亚非会议关于集体自卫的规定截然相反。美国妄图曲解亚非会议宣言来掩饰它的侵略行为，显然是办不到的。
    完全符合联合国宪章关于集体自卫原则的组织是存在的。这就是最近八个欧洲国家所缔结的友好合作互助条约。大家知道，北大西洋集团和它所属的所谓“西欧联盟”国家不顾苏联同欧洲其他爱好和平国家谋求和平的努力，正在重新武装西德，竭力准备发动原子战争，并且毫不讳言战争锋芒是指向苏联同欧洲人民民主国家。八国为了对付这种战争威胁，根据联合国宪章第五十一条行使单独或集体自卫的权利，自动组织起来，加强它们的防御力量，保卫和平，这是非常必要的。
    八国条约完全符合联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，还表现在其他许多具体规定中。譬如这个条约规定，共同保证在国际关系中，不用武力相威胁或使用武力，而主张用和平方法解决国际纷争，就是同联合国宪章第五十二条规定区域组织对国际争端应力求和平解决的精神一致的。八国条约规定，其他欧洲国家都可以加入这个条约，并希望在欧洲所有国家参加的基础上建立欧洲集体安全体系，以共同保障欧洲的和平。在欧洲安全体系一旦建立起来，八国条约就自动失效。缔约国继续主张采取普遍裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的有效措施，以保障和平。
    八国条约的这些特点，证明它是一个和平的条约，是完全防御性质的。它同美国策划和控制的北大西洋侵略集团和东南亚侵略集团以及其他军事组织是一个显明的对照。谁在维护和平，谁在搞侵略战争，非常清楚。尽管美国力图曲解亚非会议关于集体自卫原则来掩饰它的组织侵略集团的活动，可是事实证明它只能是枉费心机。
