    The twenty-four state-owned pastures in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have produced over ten thousand head of high-quality livestock for the country this year.

    In the Tengliang, Juliuhe, and other four pastures, over five thousand lambs of the Tsigai sheep, Mongolian sheep, and Tsigai-Mongolian crossbred improved sheep have been bred this spring. During the lambing period, the Mongolian and Han workers of each pasture worked day and night, carefully protecting the lambs and feeding the ewes. The Huitengliang Stud Farm improved the feeding and management of ewes, and 27% of the Tsigai pregnant ewes in the farm gave birth to twins.

    The Hulunbuir, Machi, and Daheihe pastures are now breeding large numbers of large livestock, including Soviet Heavy Draft, Don, Kabardin, and other famous breeds of foals, as well as Dutch, North Manchurian, and other fine breeds of calves.
