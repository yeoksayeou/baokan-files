Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Secretariat of the World Peace Council held a press conference in Vienna on the 18th.

    World Peace Council Director Dastiel de la Vigerie presided over the press conference. He said that the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held a meeting in Vienna from May 17 to May 18, and among the issues discussed were preparations for the World Peace Congress.

    Dastiel de la Vigerie then read out the statement of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council on the signing of the Austrian State Treaty.

    The statement said: The Secretariat of the World Peace Council welcomes the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, which is a new step on the road to mutual understanding and peace.

    The statement said: The principle that the World Peace Council has consistently advocated and upheld over the years, namely that negotiation is the only possible way to peacefully resolve contentious international issues, is gaining new victories. We firmly believe that, whether in Europe or Asia, there are no contentious international issues that cannot be resolved through sincere negotiations between the governments concerned, in a spirit of mutual understanding. The people of all countries hope that the upcoming Four-Power talks will be conducted in this spirit.

    Subsequently, some directors of the World Peace Council answered many questions raised by reporters and described the extensive preparations being made by various countries for the World Peace Congress.

    The congress will be broadly representative, with people of all professions, of different political views and religious beliefs, and eminent scientists, politicians and political figures from many countries around the world participating. For example, Édouard Herriot, Honorary President of the French National Assembly, has agreed to serve as Honorary Head of the French delegation.

    The members of the delegations from Japan, India, Brazil, South America and other countries include members of parliament and leaders of many political parties. The Mexican delegation will be led by the President of the Republic himself or his personal representative.

    Personnel from the World Peace Congress emphasized that delegations from neutral countries such as Austria, Switzerland, and Sweden will play an important role in the work of the congress.

    The congress will freely discuss issues such as the prohibition of atomic weapons, the defense of the security of European and Asian countries, the establishment of normal economic and cultural relations and cooperation between countries, and issues related to the struggle against the establishment of military blocs.
Korea
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Korean National Congress for the Defense of Peace was held at the Moranbong Theater in Pyongyang on the evening of May 16. Seven hundred and thirty-five representatives from all walks of life from all over Korea attended the congress.

    Park Jung-ae, head of the Korean delegation attending the Asian Countries Conference, gave a report at the meeting entitled "The Struggle for Peace, National Independence, and Friendship Among the Peoples of All Countries." In her report, Park Jung-ae spoke about the significant achievements of the Asian Countries Conference and the Asian-African Conference, and about the struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland. She said: Today, the people of Asian countries are widely engaged in the struggle for peace, national independence, and friendly coexistence among the peoples of all countries. The Five Principles of the joint declarations of the Prime Ministers of China and India, and the Prime Ministers of China and Myanmar are examples of peaceful coexistence in Asia. The increasing friendship and unity of the Asian people is a heavy blow to imperialism.

    The meeting discussed Park Jung-ae's report. After the discussion, the meeting unanimously adopted a resolution expressing full support for the work done by the Korean delegation at the Asian Countries Conference, welcoming the convening of the Helsinki World Peace Congress, and deciding to send a delegation to participate.
