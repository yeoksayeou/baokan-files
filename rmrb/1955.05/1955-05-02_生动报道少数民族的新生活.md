Vividly Report the New Life of Ethnic Minorities

The newspapers in ethnic minority areas should have distinct ethnic characteristics. It should not only regularly place the major activities of all ethnic groups in the region in a prominent position for publicity; it should often pay attention to ethnic characteristics in its economic, political, and cultural publicity reports; it should have a certain number of commentaries to discuss how to strengthen ethnic work and build ethnic minority areas; and it should use fresh and lively small columns to regularly publish short and pithy news dispatches to vividly report the various activities of the people of all ethnic groups and their ever-changing lives. Small columns such as the Xikang Daily's "The Advancing Brotherly Ethnic Groups of Xikang," the Yunnan Daily's "Border Construction," the Gansu Daily's "Pastoral Life," and the Sichuan Daily's "The Communist Party's Glory Shines on the Greater and Lesser Liangshan Mountains" are all worthy of promotion. The advantage of these short news dispatches in small columns is not only that they can reflect the new life of the people of all ethnic minorities in a more comprehensive way, but also that because they are vivid in content, concise in length, and easy to understand, they are easier for ethnic minority readers who are new to Chinese characters to read, and they are more suitable for reading groups in ethnic minority areas to use as materials for reading and explaining newspapers. In this way, the newspaper can play a deeper and more specific role in implementing the Party's ethnic policies and strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups. (Yizhi)

专栏：

　　生动报道少数民族的新生活
    少数民族地区的报纸，应该具有鲜明的民族色彩。它不只是应该把本地区各民族的各项重大活动，经常放在自己的首要地位来加以宣传；应该经常在自己各项经济、政治、文化的宣传报道中，尽量注意民族特点；应该有一定数量的评论来论述如何加强民族工作和建设民族地区的问题；而且应该用新鲜活泼的小专栏，经常刊登短小精悍的新闻通讯，来生动地报道各民族人民的各项活动和他们日新月异的生活面貌。像西康日报所设的“前进中的西康各兄弟民族”、云南日报的“边疆建设”、甘肃日报的“牧区生活”和四川日报的“共产党的光辉照耀着大小凉山”等小专栏，都是值得提倡的。这种小专栏里的短小的新闻通讯的好处，不仅是可以比较多方面地反映各少数民族人民新的生活面貌，而且由于它内容生动，篇幅简短、文字通俗，就更便于初识汉字的少数民族读者阅读，也更适合于少数民族地区读报组作为读报和讲报的材料。这样，报纸在贯彻党的民族政策、密切各民族的团结方面，就可以发生更深刻更具体的作用。　（亦之）
