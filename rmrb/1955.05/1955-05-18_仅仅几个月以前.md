　  Just a Few Months Ago...
    Li Peng
    Hu Feng deeply felt "ashamed" and "painful," Hu Feng "confessed." It is said that his mistake was only in something about the "petty bourgeoisie..."
    You see: How "good" my "subjectivity" is! I demanded
  “anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism,” I demanded "sharing the fate of the people," I struggled arduously in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Only... Alas! I just damnably neglected the difference between the petty-bourgeois revolutionary nature and the working-class revolutionary nature, just "limited to a narrow practical viewpoint." But you put the big hat of anti-Party and anti-Marxism on me, how wronged I am! How "painful" this is—unlucky!
    People will remember how, just a few months ago, Hu Feng was aggressively launching an attack on the Party, calling himself a defender of Marxism and a defender of the Party's principles in art, accusing those who criticized him of reversing, opposing, and canceling the principles of Marxism-Leninism; of breaking away from politics and abolishing Party spirit. Now, after the widespread unfolding of criticism of Hu Feng's anti-Party thoughts, Hu Feng made such a "confession." Half-辩解(biànjiě) an excuse, half a complaint, plus snot and tears.
    What kind of "confession" is this? Is it answering the critics' "whip" "wrapped in rubber"? Or is it "having to accompany to play the game of adding official rank" and "shaking hands and making peace" with us "with a smile covering insult"?
    Hu Feng, who has consistently opposed the literary and art movement led by the Party for ten years, "determined to coexist with the position," and fought in "absolute isolation," referring to the Party as "official," cursing the Party's staff as "mandarins," cursing progressive writers as "philistines," "maggots," and "opportunists," and desperately resisting the Party's ideological and organizational leadership of the literary and art movement, yet calls himself possessing "the petty-bourgeois revolutionary nature and standpoint," calls himself "sharing the fate of the people," who is he deceiving?
    The mask must be stripped off! It is hoped that all those who have mixed with Hu Feng will quickly participate in the struggle to strip off the mask!

　  仅仅几个月以前……
    李芃
    胡风深深地感到了“惭愧”和“痛苦”了，胡风“检讨”了。据说，他的错误仅仅在于什么“小资产阶级……”。
    你们看：我的“主观”是多么善良啊！我要求
  “反帝反封建”，我要求“和人民共命运”，我在国民党统治区里艰苦斗争。只是……唉！只是该死地疏忽了小资产阶级革命性和工人阶级革命性之间的区别，只是“局限于狭隘的实践观点”。可是，你们给我戴上了反党反马克思主义的大帽子，这是多么冤枉！这是多么“痛苦”——倒霉！
    人们还会记得，仅仅几个月以前，胡风曾经是怎样气势汹汹地向党发动进攻，自称为马克思主义的保卫者和艺术的党性原则的保卫者，指斥批评他的人是颠倒了、反对了、取消了马克思列宁主义底原则；脱离了政治，取消了党性。现在，批判胡风反党思想广泛展开之后，胡风就做了这样的“检讨”。半是辩解，半是诉苦，加上鼻涕和眼泪。
    这是什么“检讨”呢？是回答批评者的“用橡皮包着”的“鞭子”呢？还是“不得不奉陪一道跳加官”、“用微笑包着侮蔑”同我们“握手言欢”呢？
    十年来一贯反对党所领导的文艺运动、“抱着与阵地共存亡的决心”、“绝对孤立的”作战的胡风，指党为“官方”、咒骂党的工作人员为“老爷”、咒骂进步作家为“市侩”、“蛆虫”、“投机”的胡风，竭力抵制党对文艺运动的思想领导和组织领导的胡风，却自称为有“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”，自称为“和人民共命运”，欺骗谁呢？
    假面必须剥去，希望一切曾同胡风混在一起的人，迅速参加到剥去假面的斗争中来！
