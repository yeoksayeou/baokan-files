　　Brazen Criminals
　　By Our Correspondent Li Yi

　　The leaders of the Fengfeng City Construction Company in Hebei Province have done many incomprehensible things in the past two years. In every project they have contracted, many brazen criminal facts can be found. For example, of the nine bridges they contracted to build, two have already collapsed, five are damaged, one is cracked, and the remaining one is also in danger. The city's People's Hospital, which they contracted to build, leaked as soon as the water tower was built, and the water pipes inside the water tower were even tied with hemp rope in some places. The hospital's brick wall was only one person high, but even such a low wall was propped up with sticks while being built. Not long after it was built, almost half of it collapsed. The department store building they built has become the biggest joke; as a reporter for the Hebei Daily wrote: "Strangely enough, the department store's employees have been suffering from 'wind-phobia' since August last year. One night, when the employees were sleeping soundly in the building, a strong wind suddenly blew up, and they felt the building shake a few times in their sleep, so they all got up. At first, everyone thought it was an earthquake, but later they discovered that it was the wind that was shaking the building. From then on, whenever a strong wind blows, people run down from the building, and some simply move their offices downstairs." The reason is simple: the construction company used a large amount of inferior wood when building the building. Of the more than seventy joists supporting the floor, twenty-one were rotten, with an average of more than a dozen wormholes per meter.

　　The construction company's magic weapon for making money is lying and deception. For example, in the construction of the city's People's Hospital, they charged the client more than 29,000 yuan for just five items. When they contracted to build the large warehouse in Handan City, they clearly saw that the client had written 10,000 catties of cement too much in the budget, but they kept silent and pocketed the 10,000 catties of cement for nothing. After deceiving people like this, they still do not properly fulfill their due responsibilities. The cement work they did has cracked with four hundred and sixty-three large cracks.

　　Now all the bad deeds of this construction company have been exposed. However, they have an old trick: for those projects that are really bad and about which the client has many complaints, they perfunctorily do some rework. If it doesn't work the first time, they do it a second time, and if it doesn't work the second time, they do it a third time. Besides this, there is another trick: simply refuse to rework. They say: the project is bad because the cost is low; it would be better if there was more money. After the Hecun Bridge was washed away last year, they even proposed that the client redo the budget and then let them build a new one. As for the department store building, they say: Are you afraid of the wind? Just build a wall behind it.

　　Last year, a branch secretary of the company criticized the company leaders for having capitalist management ideas. The company leaders not only did not admit it, but instead said: "Whoever says that is likely to be an agent of the bourgeoisie." A site director named Shi Yuling even openly said: "If you want to do a good job on the project, you have to get all the Party and League members out." The year before last, the company leaders even proposed that the head of the materials department, who was best at defrauding money, be evaluated as a model worker.

　　In the past two years, this engineering company has directly handed over more than 200,000 yuan in profits to its leading organization, the Hebei Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau. From the perspective of the projects contracted by this construction company, this amount of money is not small. The problem is: the Provincial Engineering Bureau did not ask how these profits came about. A few days ago, the director of the Provincial Engineering Bureau took some people to Fengfeng to inspect the department store building and other projects. However, after they finished the inspection, they said to the people: "Everyone, work with peace of mind, this building will not collapse." Is the quality standard of the Provincial Engineering Bureau just "not collapsing"? After the leading organization inspected the work of this company, is that the only conclusion they can draw?

### 明目张胆的犯罪者

　　明目张胆的犯罪者
　　本报记者　李翼
    河北省峰峰市建筑公司的领导人员，在过去两年中，做了许多令人难以理解的事情。在他们包建的每一项工程中，都可以找到许多明目张胆的犯罪事实。例如：他们包建的九座桥，至今已有两座冲塌，五座冲坏，一座裂缝，剩下的一座也有危险。他们包建的市人民医院，水塔刚刚修起就漏水，水塔里的输水管，有的地方竟是用麻绳绑的。医院的砖围墙只有一人高，可是就是这么低的墙也还是边砌边用棍子支着，砌好后没有多久，就倒塌了差不多一半。他们修建的百货公司大楼，已成了人们最大的笑料，关于这，河北日报的记者写道：“说来奇怪，百货公司的职工，从去年八月就得了‘怕风症’。一天夜里，职工们在大楼里睡得挺熟时，突然刮起了大风，他们在睡意矇眬中忽然觉得大楼晃了几晃，就都起来了。起初，大家以为是地震，后来发现是风刮楼动。从那时起，一刮大风，人们就从楼上往下跑，有的就干脆搬到楼下来办公。”原因很简单：这个建筑公司在修建这所楼时，大量地使用了劣等木材，七十多根架楼板的龙骨木，就有二十一根是坏的，平均每一公尺有十几个虫眼。
    这个建筑公司捞钱的法宝，就是说谎、蒙骗。例如他们在包建市人民医院工程中，只五项材料就向业主多要了二万九千多元。他们在包建邯郸市的大仓库时，明明看出业主誊写预算表中多写了一万斤水泥，但他们一声不响，把一万斤水泥白白地捞到了手里。就这样骗了人之后，还不好好地担负起自己应尽的职责，他们所做的水泥工程，已裂了四百六十三道大缝。
    现在这个建筑公司所有的劣迹，统统被人们揭发出来了。可是，他们有一条老主意：做得实在糟的、业主意见多的，就马马虎虎地来个返工，一次不行，再来第二次，第二次不行，再来第三次。除此以外还有一条，就是：干脆拒绝返工。他们说：工程坏是因为造价低，钱多就好了。去年和村桥被冲后，他们竟提出要业主重做预算，再由他们修新的。百货公司大楼呢，他们说：怕刮风吗？在后边帮上一道墙好了。
    去年，这个公司的一个支部书记批评公司领导上有资本主义经营思想，公司的领导人不但不承认，反说：“谁这样说，谁就可能是资产阶级的代理人。”一个叫施玉岭的工地主任甚至公开说：“要想搞好工程，就要把党、团员都弄出去。”前年，公司的领导人甚至提议把最会骗钱的材料科长评为模范工作者。
    这个工程公司在过去两年中，直接向它的领导机关——河北省建筑工程局，交上了二十多万元的利润。从这个建筑公司所承包的工程来说，这笔钱是不算少的。问题在于：省工程局并没有问问这些利润是怎样来的。前些日子，省工程局局长带着一些人到峰峰检查了百货公司大楼和其他的工程。可是，他们检查完了，对人们说：“大家安心工作吧，这座楼倒不了。”难道省工程局的质量标准就是“倒不了”吗？领导机关检查了这个公司的工作后，难道只能得出这样的结论来吗？
