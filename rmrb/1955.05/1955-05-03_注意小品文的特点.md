Pay Attention to the Characteristics of Short Essays
　　He Hao Ru
    Short essays are gradually increasing in newspapers, and readers welcome them. The short essay is a powerful weapon for criticism, and the correct and effective use of this weapon is one of the characteristics that newspapers in the new China should possess.
    In the short essays published in various newspapers, many still lack the distinct characteristics that short essays should have, mainly the lack of powerful satire, despite some witty remarks.
    Satire cannot be manufactured. Satire must be excavated from real life. In the reality of our country, the contradiction and conflict between the dominant positive forces, progressive phenomena, and the negative forces and backward phenomena are the social source of satire. In a social environment that opposes bureaucracy, bureaucratic ideology and work style are shameful; in a social environment that advocates thrift and opposes waste, extravagance and waste are shameful. Revealing and satirizing the negative people and things through real contradictions and conflicts is precisely the task of short essays.
    However, some short essays merely expose certain bad phenomena without showing the conflict between these phenomena and the positive social environment, without showing the actual contradictions and conflicts, with the result that readers cannot fully see the leading force of the new society, cannot fully see the ridiculous situation of the things that should be negated, and therefore cannot feel the pungent satirical power. Without contrast and conflict, there can be no sparks of satire with great educational power.
    In fact, bad phenomena that are incompatible with the main trend of the new society cannot but arouse the disgust of the surrounding progressive forces, and cannot but arouse the "laughter" expressed in various ways (obvious, hidden, positive, side...). And those who are "laughed at" cannot completely pass unhindered and feel at ease in such an environment, but often feel contradictions, embarrassment, and show ridiculous states of hypocrisy, boasting, or blushing. Starting from these places, writing, it is possible to write short essays with dazzling satirical sharpness.
    In the process of collecting, investigating, and researching materials, the author of the short essay should not only pay attention to the authenticity of the facts, but also pay attention to the conflict between the negative and positive forces in the development of the facts, even if it is a subtle and tortuous conflict. Grasping the spark that spews out from this conflict is to grasp the essence of satire. The conciseness, simplicity, and vividness of the text are absolutely necessary, but only by paying attention to the expression methods on the above basis can it have practical significance.
    We all lack experience in writing short essays, and it is difficult to write ideal short essays all at once, but as long as we grasp the characteristics of short essays, we can gradually improve the quality of short essays in the continuous writing practice process.

　　注意小品文的特点
　　何浩如
    报纸上的小品文渐渐多起来了，读者是欢迎的。小品文是进行批评的有力武器，正确地、有效地使用这一武器，正是新中国报纸应有的特色之一。
    在各报发表的小品文中，有许多还缺乏小品文应有的鲜明特点，主要是缺乏有力的讽刺，尽管有些俏皮话。
    讽刺是制造不出来的。讽刺必须从现实生活中发掘出来。在我国的现实生活中，占统治地位的正面力量、进步现象同反面力量、落后现象的矛盾和冲突，是产生讽刺的社会泉源。在反对官僚主义的社会环境中，官僚主义的思想作风是可耻的；在提倡节约、反对浪费的社会环境中，铺张浪费的现象是可耻的。而通过现实的矛盾和冲突，揭露和讽刺反面的人和事，正是小品文的任务。
    可是有些小品文的内容仅仅是对某些坏现象的单纯揭露，没有表现出这种现象同正面的社会环境的冲突，没有表现出实际存在的矛盾和冲突，结果使读者不能充分看见新社会的主导力量，不能充分看见应该否定的事物的可笑的处境，因此感觉不出辛辣的讽刺力量。没有对比和冲突，就不能出现有巨大教育力量的讽刺的火花。
    事实上，同新社会的主潮不相容的坏现象，不能不引起周围进步力量的反感，不能不引起用各种方式（明显的、隐藏的、正面的、侧面的……）表露出来的“笑”。而被“笑”者在这样的环境中也不可能完全通行无阻，心安理得，却常常会感到矛盾，窘迫，表现出口是心非、大言不惭或面红耳赤的可笑状态。从这些地方着眼，下笔，就可能写出有耀眼的讽刺锋芒的小品文。
    小品文的作者在搜集、调查、研究材料的过程中不但要注意事实的真实性，而且一定要注意在事实的发展中反面力量同正面力量的冲突，那怕是细微曲折的冲突。抓住从这种冲突中喷射出来的火花，便抓住了讽刺的本质。文字的精练、朴素、生动，是完全必要的，但只有在上述的基础上讲究表现方法，才有实际的意义。
    我们大家都缺乏写小品文的经验，很难一下子写出理想的小品文，但只要把握住小品文的特点，就能够在不断的写作实践过程中逐渐提高小品文的质量。
