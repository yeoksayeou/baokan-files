When wheat is already ripe, is there no way or need to pay attention to increasing yield? There are still ways to increase production, and that is to do a good job of harvesting and increase the harvest volume. Experience proves that this is a key to increasing production that requires little effort but yields great results. If we do not pay attention to this issue, even if the wheat grows well, the actual harvest will be reduced. Although this is an old problem, it is not one that is no longer worth paying attention to. This year, in some places where harvesting has already begun, the harvesting work is still not being done very carefully. According to a letter from reporter Gao Fuxiao of Zhejiang People's Broadcasting Station: he saw that in the Baisha Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Yueqing County, there were still many ears of wheat left uncleaned on the harvested ground and threshed straw. A lot was also eaten by chickens when drying the wheat.

This phenomenon also exists in other places. In some areas, the wheat harvest has historically been "eight-tenths of the harvest from a ten-year good harvest." In areas like Linyi, Shandong Province, wheat is often harvested when it is only 70-80% ripe, and the kernels are not full enough; moreover, farmers harvest coarsely in order to rush the harvest. Some areas harvest too late, and the phenomenon of grain shedding is serious, resulting in considerable losses.

Agricultural production cooperatives have many superior conditions, with sufficient manpower and material resources that are easy to allocate, and they should be able to achieve timely harvesting and careful harvesting and threshing more easily. However, based on past lessons and the current situation, some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have more extensive phenomena in harvesting than individual farmers. Because the labor organization is unreasonable and the ideological education work is weak, some members want to be quick and save trouble, only caring about getting more work points for themselves and are unwilling to harvest and thresh carefully. Some cooperatives, due to poor planning, harvested wheat that should have been harvested later earlier, and harvested wheat that should have been harvested earlier later. Some members of mutual aid groups harvest their own crops very carefully, but harvest others' crops very coarsely. This year there are more mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and more attention should be paid to these issues.

The phenomenon of scattering during harvesting is not unavoidable. In the past few years, various places have created many experiences in careful harvesting and threshing. In Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, ninety-four high-yield villages harvested in a timely manner, harvested quickly and threshed carefully, and used the time in the early morning and evening when it was not easy to thresh to transport the wheat, resulting in an additional 400,000 catties of wheat from 82,000 mu of wheat. This year, the Second Agricultural Production Cooperative of Lisuo Village, Maicha Township, Dechang County, Xikang Province organized children to pick up wheat in the harvested wheat fields after school in the afternoon. On the first afternoon, five children picked up two liters of wheat. These examples show that as long as we pay attention to this matter and slightly improve the harvesting methods, we can recover a lot of grain.

Making the greatest effort to increase wheat yield is one of the important tasks of wheat-producing areas at present. Agricultural production cooperatives in wheat-producing areas should pay special attention to rationally distributing labor, leading and helping the surrounding mutual aid groups and individual farmers, carefully doing a good job in wheat harvesting, and striving to harvest as much as the land produces, so as not to let the fruits of hard work suffer any losses. In terms of grasping the timing of harvesting, agricultural technicians should earnestly provide assistance to farmers.

### 适时收割，精收细打，提高小麦收获量

　　适时收割，精收细打，提高小麦收获量

    在小麦已经成熟的时候，是不是就已经没有办法也不必要再注意增加产量了呢？增产的办法还是有的，那就是做好收割工作，提高收获量。经验证明，这是一个费力小收效大的增产关键。如果不注意这个问题，麦子即使长得很好，实际的收成也会降低。这虽然是一个老问题，可是，并不是已经不值得注意的了。今年有一些已经开始收割的地方，收割工作还是做得很不细致。据浙江省人民广播电台记者高扶小来信说：他看到乐清县城郊乡白沙农业生产合作社收割过的地上和打过的麦秆上，还留有很多麦穗没有收拾干净。在晒麦的时候，鸡吃的也不少。
    这种现象在别的地方也有。有些地区历年来麦收都是“十成年景八成收”。像山东临沂地区，往往小麦只有七八成熟就收割了，籽粒不够饱满；而且农民为了抢收，割得很粗糙。有些地区收割过迟，籽粒脱落现象严重，也受到不少损失。
    农业生产合作社有许多优越条件，人力物力比较充足，便于调配，本来应当更容易做到适时收割和精收细打。可是，根据往年的教训和今年的情况看，有些农业生产合作社和互助组在收割中的粗放现象比单干农民还严重。因为劳动组织不合理，思想教育工作薄弱，有的社员图快图省事，只顾自己多得工分，不愿细致地割打。有些社由于计划不周，把该迟割的麦子早割了，把该早割的麦子迟割了。有的互助组员割自己的庄稼很细致，割别人的就很粗糙。今年互助合作组织更多了，对这些问题应当更加注意。
    收割中的抛撒现象并不是不可避免的。在过去几年中，各地已创造出许多精收细打的经验。陕西省兴平县九十四个丰产村，去年麦收时适时收割，快割细打，利用早晚不易脱粒的时间拉运，八万二千亩小麦多收了四十万斤。今年西康省德昌县麦岔乡李所村第二农业生产合作社把儿童组织起来，在下午放学后到收割过麦地里去捡麦子，第一天下午五个儿童就捡回两升麦子。这些事例都说明了，只要重视这件事，收获方法稍加改进，就可以多收回不少粮食。
    尽最大努力提高小麦收获量，是产麦区当前的重要任务之一。产麦区的农业生产合作社应当特别注意合理地支配劳动力，带动和帮助周围的互助组和单干农民，细致地做好麦收工作，争取地里产多少就收多少，不要让辛勤劳动的成果遭受一点损失。在掌握收割时机方面，农业技术工作者应当切实地给农民以帮助。
