The Art of Oral Propaganda
　　——Bai Xiyan, Propagandist of the Forging Workshop of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, Talks About Propaganda Experience

　　"Eating Cold Rice" and "Hitting Cold Iron"

　　I wanted to talk to Sun Shuting a long time ago, but only today did I manage to arrange it. I want to talk to Sun Shuting about the issue of "hitting cold iron." The technical operating procedures clearly stipulate how much the raw material must be heated to before forging can begin, and at what temperature the forging must stop. However, some people often violate these regulations. When the temperature has already dropped to the prescribed level, they should reheat it before striking, but they find it troublesome, and often don't reheat it and continue to finish the work. In our forging terms, this is called "hitting cold iron." Why do they "hit cold iron"? From what I understand, while it's true that this is an old habit left over from decades ago and is not easy to get rid of all at once, the main reason is that people haven't clearly recognized the harm that "hitting cold iron" does to the machines and the quality of the products. I think we should immediately explain this issue to the masses. Sun Shuting is just one of many people who frequently "hit cold iron," but because he is an old worker and the production team leader, if he can quickly overcome this problem, it will have a very large impact on the masses. Secondly, he is an old friend of mine for many years, and it's easier to talk to him casually, which will help me gain experience for the next time I talk to someone. At the same time, I also feel that if I see a friend with shortcomings and don't help him correct them, what kind of friend am I?

　　My conversation with Sun Shuting took place during the night shift break. I didn't mention the "hitting cold iron" right away. Seeing him eating, I casually asked him:

　　"What delicious food are you eating, Lao Sun?"

　　"I'm eating 'gun sand'!" he said, holding the lunch box under my chin for me to see.

　　"What? Is the rice not cooked?" I said.

　　"This is really twisting things around. My stomach has been bothering me for days, and now I've eaten a meal of uncooked rice," he said, glancing at me. "Hey, Lao Bai, does your stomach still bother you?"

　　"My stomach? It bothers me every other day," I said. After saying this, I discovered a conversation topic from Lao Sun's words. "Stomach problem" – this was such a personal matter for Lao Sun! It was a hundred times more vivid than the talking points I had prepared for three or four hours, so I abandoned my original talking points and started with "stomach problems." I deliberately asked him:

　　"Lao Sun! Do you know how we got our stomach problems?"

　　"I'll never forget how the old society treated us badly! When we were apprentices together under the puppet Manchukuo regime, the capitalists gave us cold rice to eat every day. Isn't that how we got our stomach problems!" After a short pause, he continued, "Now, the apprentices in the new society are so happy! No one gives them cold rice anymore!"

　　"I see that there are still people eating cold rice in our factory," I said.

　　"If they want to eat it themselves, who can stop them!"

　　"It's not that they want to eat it themselves, they are forced to."

　　"Who's forcing who? You tell me!" Lao Sun looked in the direction I was pointing and saw the two-ton steam hammer he was using. He was stunned. I continued, "Today, some of us only care about our own happiness, but make them suffer, not knowing that without them, we wouldn't have our happiness. Of course, I'm not saying that anyone has forced the steam hammer to eat cold rice, I'm saying that some people often force the steam hammer to eat cold iron. If it could speak and walk, it would have gone to the People's Court to sue us long ago."

　　"So you're still talking about 'hitting cold iron'!" He already understood what I meant, but he didn't agree right away, retorting, "I've been using this hammer for months, and it hasn't broken down once because of 'hitting cold iron'."

　　"If the problem was so obvious, you wouldn't be hitting cold iron anymore," I said patiently. "When we first ate cold rice, we didn't feel any impact on our health. But, as the days went by and we got older, we got stomach problems! The steam hammer is the same, it won't break down immediately after hitting cold iron once or twice. But, over time, problems will arise. It could be used for fifteen years, but it won't even last ten. The people of the whole country save money and give us money to buy such good machines. If we quickly ruin them, then when people come and ask us, what will we say in response? ... Besides, we are old workers, and many young men are learning from us. Our every move is a mirror for them. If they also get into the bad habit of 'hitting cold iron,' it will be as difficult to cure as our stomach problems now, and it will cause even greater losses to production. Do you agree, Lao Sun?" Then, I explained the harm of "hitting cold iron" to him from a technical point of view.

　　Lao Sun held my hand tightly, and I could see from his face that he understood. After a while, he said excitedly:

　　"From today on, I will tie the two things, 'eating cold rice' and 'hitting cold iron,' together and keep them in my mind, and guarantee that I will never hit cold iron again. Do you believe me, Lao Bai?"

　　"I believe you!" I replied sincerely.

　　I really believe my old friend, because he never makes empty promises.

　　"Only by Caring for People Can You Persuade Them"

　　After going to work on the morning of February 6th, I found it a little strange to see the young stoker Du Baoshan. This young man usually loves to talk and laugh the most. Why is he so frowning today? Someone said to me, "If you don't criticize Little Du for working so listlessly, he'll get spoiled!" However, I have always been against criticizing people without asking the "reason." I thought, "There must be a reason why Little Du is like this!"

　　At noon, Little Du walked out of the cafeteria lazily. I asked him, "Little Du, are you feeling unwell? Come on, I'll take you to the clinic to see!"

　　"I'm not sick," he said softly with his head down.

　　"Then why aren't you happy? Is there any difficulty? Can you tell me about it?" I asked him again.

　　"Master Bai," he said hesitatingly after a while, "to tell you the truth, I've already spent all my meal tickets. I only ate two steamed buns at noon today, but there are still six or seven days until I get paid! ..."

　　Oh, so that's what it was! Seeing that he wouldn't have anything to eat tonight, how could he concentrate on production? I comforted him and said:

　　"Little Du, don't worry, I'll think of a way."

　　I immediately borrowed 30,000 yuan (old currency) from others and bought him meal tickets. A smile immediately appeared on his face, and he said excitedly:

　　"Master Bai, how should I thank you!"

　　"Thank everyone, the money was collected by everyone," I said.

　　After Little Du left, I started to think: In the past few days, I have solved several problems like his. Why do these young men always not have enough money to spend? I carefully studied the materials I had mastered on a daily basis. This is mainly because they don't spend money carefully and have no planning. If I only help them with money, it's like giving a patient a "tonic," which will only make the disease come back after a while. I should solve this problem from the root. So I went to find Little Du again.

　　I didn't tell Little Du any principles. I took out a copy of the "China Youth" magazine from my pocket, turned to a satirical cartoon titled "Regret in the Beginning," and handed it to Little Du, saying:

　　"What do you think of this painting?"

　　Little Du took it and stared at it intently. This painting depicts the contrast between a person's life at the beginning and end of the month. After receiving his salary at the beginning of the month, he looks like this: his arms are full of refreshments, carp, roast duck, and roast chicken, as well as bananas, oranges, apples, and pears; he is holding several packs of Green Tinplate brand cigarettes in his hand; he has two bottles of "Brandy" in his pocket; he has a sausage around his neck; and he is smoking two cigarettes in his mouth... The appearance at the end of the month is different: the pockets of his clothes are turned inside out, and he can't even find a meal ticket. He stands in the cafeteria in a daze with a sad face.

　　The more Little Du looked, the redder his face became. I asked him:

　　"What do you think of this painting?"

　　"It's absolutely brilliant!" Little Du looked at the painting again and said in a low voice, "The person in the painting is not me, but he looks a bit like me..."

　　"If you want to see it, take it away and show it to everyone. This painting is good for all of us!" I said.

　　In the afternoon, Du Baoshan's mood changed. A suggestion from a Soviet expert on improving the method of burning furnaces was considered too troublesome by many people and was not well implemented, but Little Du tried it out. In this way, the material he burned was both good and fast. He did 27 more jobs today than he did in the past with the same work.

　　It was time to get off work. On the way home, I thought to myself, answering my own questions: What would have happened if I had criticized Little Du without asking the reason? I think we might have done 27 fewer jobs today. What would have happened if I had known that he didn't have a meal ticket and didn't help him solve it, but used cartoons to satirize him and scold him for not planning his spending? He would definitely say, "Go away, propaganda doesn't fill your stomach!" He would never say "The person in the painting looks a bit like me." ... The more I thought about it, the more I felt that the phrase that the branch secretary often said to our party members and propagandists was very right:

　　"Only by caring for people can you persuade them."

　　"The Story of the Mailman"

　　Recently, I found that our workplace was very chaotic. All the tools, parts, and raw materials were not arranged in an orderly manner in places that were convenient to use. We often wasted a lot of time looking for tools during work. This is an important reason affecting labor productivity, and it is also not in line with the requirements of civilized production.

　　In order to eliminate this phenomenon, I used the lunch break to hold a discussion. At the beginning of the discussion, I first told everyone the story of a mailman.

　　Normally, I especially like to collect good fables. The story of the mailman was selected from the materials I accumulated on a daily basis. The content of this story is like this: Once upon a time, there was a mailman who never sorted the letters by address before sending them. He said it was too troublesome to do so. This is how he sent the letters: he randomly pulled a letter out of the mailbag, looked at the address: "Room 35," which was on the fourth floor of this building, and sent it there. Then he pulled out the second letter: "Room 5," which was on the first floor, so he ran down from the fourth floor and sent it there. But the next letter was on the fourth floor again, so he had to run upstairs again. This is how the mailman ran back and forth to deliver the letters.

　　When I finished telling this story, everyone burst out laughing. Some said, "This is nothing like a mailman, he's just a stupid ox!" Some said, "If there were such a mailman now, he would definitely be fired." I continued, "Don't laugh, there are people in our group who are like this mailman!"

　　At this time, the venue was immediately silent, and everyone looked at each other inexplicably. After a while, someone asked me:

　　"Master Bai, tell us quickly, how are we like him?"

　　"Take a look!" I pointed to the tools, parts, and material heads that were scattered on the ground and said, "Things that we don't need at the moment are placed next to us, which are in the way, but things that we need right away are placed far away. To find a tool, we run here for a while and there for a while. If we add up the time wasted in vain, how much less work have we done! Think about it, what's the difference between us and this mailman?"

　　This analogy sparked a lot of discussion: "That's right! We're just like this unlucky mailman!" "Our problem is even more serious than this mailman!" I immediately stood up and said to everyone:

　　"Okay, now let's discuss how to overcome this problem!"

　　So, we had a heated discussion on how to do a good job in preparing for production, how to strengthen the planning of work, how to keep the workplace clean and tidy, and so on. Everyone unanimously proposed: guarantee not to be such a mailman. (Fu Mo, Liu Jianbang Record)

    口头宣传的艺术
　　——沈阳风动工具厂锻压车间宣传员白锡彦谈宣传经验
　　“吃冷饭”和“打冷铁”
    很早我就想找孙书亭谈一次话，直到今天才定下来。我想同孙书亭谈的是关于“打冷铁”的问题。技术操作规程上规定得很清楚，把原料加热到多少度才能开始锻造，温度降低到多少度必须停止锻造。但是，有些人却经常违反这规定，本来温度已经降低到规定的度数，应该去重新加热后再打，可是他们嫌麻烦，往往不再去加热就继续把活打完，用我们锻工的话来说，这就叫“打冷铁”。为什么他们要“打冷铁”呢？据我了解，固然这是几十年遗留下来的老习惯，不容易一下去掉，但主要是人们还没有明确认识到“打冷铁”对机器和产品质量的害处。我觉得应该马上向群众解释这个问题。孙书亭只不过是许多经常“打冷铁”的人中的一个，因为一来他是老工人，又是生产组长，如果他能很快地克服这个毛病，对群众的影响是非常大的；二来他是我多年的老朋友，谈起话来随便些，便于从中取得下次找人谈话的经验，同时，我还觉得见到朋友有缺点不去帮助改正，那算什么朋友呢？
    我和孙书亭的谈话，是在夜班休息时间进行的。我没有一开始就提到“打冷铁”的事儿，看他正在吃饭，就顺便问他：
    “吃的什么好饭哪，老孙？”
    “我吃的是‘枪砂’！”他一边说着一边把饭盒端到我的下巴底下，叫我看。
    “怎么？饭没煮熟吗？”我说。
    “这算蹩扭出湾儿来啦，胃病折腾了好几天还没好，偏偏又吃了一顿生饭。”他说着瞅瞅我，“哎，老白，你的胃病还犯不？”
    “胃病吗？三天两头就犯劲儿。”我说完这句话以后，就从老孙的嘴里发现一个谈话材料。“胃病”——这对于老孙是多么亲切的事啊！它比我花了三、四个钟头所准备的谈话内容要生动百倍，于是我放弃了原来的谈话计划，就从“胃病”谈起来。我故意问他：
    “老孙！你知道咱们的胃病是怎么得的？”
      “旧社会对咱们的坏处，永远也不会忘掉的！伪满我俩一起当学徒的时候，资本家整天给我们冷饭吃，咱们的胃病不就是打那得上的吗！”他稍微停一会儿又继续说下去，“现在，新社会里的徒工多幸福哇！再也没有人给他们冷饭吃了！”
      “我看现在我们厂子里还有吃冷饭的。”我说。
      “如果他自己愿意吃，那谁还管得了！”
      “不是自己愿意吃，是被迫的。”
    “谁强迫谁？你说！”老孙顺着我手指头一瞧，正是他使用的那台二吨蒸汽锤，他愣住了。我接着说：“今天我们有一些人只关心自己的幸福，却叫它们去受罪，不知道没有它们就没有我们的幸福。当然，我并不是说谁强迫过汽锤吃冷饭，我是说有些人常常去强迫汽锤吃冷铁。我看它若是会说话，会走路，早就到人民法院去控告我们了。”
    “原来你还是说‘打冷铁’呀！”他已经明白我的意思，可是他的思想并没有马上搞通，反驳说：“我使用这个锤已经好几个月了，还没有一次因为‘打冷铁’坏过。”
   “问题要是那么明显，你早就不打冷铁了。”我耐心地说：“咱们当初吃冷饭的时候，也并没觉出对身体有啥影响。可是，日子长了，年岁大了，才得上胃病！汽锤也是一样，并不是打一两次冷铁马上就坏。可是，日子一长，就会出毛病了，明明能使用十五年，结果十年也使不上。全国人民省吃俭用拿钱给我们买来这样好的机器，如果我们很快把它糟蹋坏了，那么人家来问我们，我们用什么话去回答呢？……再说，我们是老工人，很多青年小伙子们在向我们学习，我们的一举一动都是他们的一面镜子，如果他们也都沾染上‘打冷铁’这个坏习惯，那就像现在我们的胃病一样不好治了，就会给生产上造成更大的损失。你说对吗，老孙？”接着，我又从技术上，把“打冷铁”的害处向他解释了一番。
    老孙紧紧地握住了我的手，我从他的脸上看出来他的思想通了。停了一会儿，他很激动地说：
  “从今天起，我就把‘吃冷饭’和‘打冷铁’这两码事拴在一块儿，挂在我的心上，保证不再打冷铁。你相信我吗，老白？”
    “我相信！”我诚恳地回答他。
    我确实相信我这位老朋友，因为他向来是不说空话的。
    “只有关心人，才能说服人”
    二月六日早晨上班以后，我见到青年烧炉工杜宝山有点奇怪，这小伙子平时是最爱说爱笑的，为什么今天这样愁眉苦脸的呢？有人跟我说：“像小杜这样无精打采地工作，不批评他一顿，惯了还得了吗！”可是，我向来是不主张不问“青红皂白”就批评人。我想：“小杜这样一定有缘故！”
    中午，小杜懒洋洋地从食堂里走出来。我问他：“小杜，身上不舒服吗？走，我领你到卫生所去看看！”
    “我没有病。”他低着头轻轻地说。
    “那为什么不大高兴呢，是不是有什么困难，能不能和我说一说呀？”我又问他。
      “白师傅，”停了一会儿，他吞吞吐吐地说：
  “不瞒您说，我的饭票已经花光了，今天晌午只吃了两个馒头，可是离发工资还有六、七天呢！……”
    噢，原来是这么回事儿！眼看晚上就吃不上饭了，他怎么能安心生产呢？我安慰他说：
    “小杜，先别发愁，我给想想办法看。”
    我马上向别人借了三万块钱（旧币），把饭票买来给他。他的脸上立刻就出现了笑容，激动地说：
  “白师傅，我应当怎样谢谢您才好哇！”
    “谢谢大家吧，这钱是大家凑起来的。”我说。
    小杜走后，我心里就开始琢磨：几天来，像他这类问题，我已经解决好几个了。为什么这些小伙子们的钱老是不够花呢？我仔细研究了一下日常所掌握的材料，这主要是因为他们花钱不加检点，没有计划性。如果光是从钱上去帮助他们，就好像给病人吃“顶药”一样，过了一时还要犯病，我应当从根儿上来解决这个问题。于是我又去找小杜。
    我没有和小杜讲什么道理。我从衣兜里掏出一本中国青年杂志，翻出一幅题为“悔不当初”的讽刺画，递给小杜说：
    “你看看这幅画怎样？”
    小杜接过去就聚精会神地看下去，这幅画画的是一个人的月初和月末生活的对比。月初领到工资以后的样子是：两只胳膊上挂满了茶点、鲤鱼、烤鸭和烧鸡，还有香蕉、橘子、苹果、大鸭梨；手里抱着几条绿锡包牌香烟；兜里装着两瓶“白兰地”；脖子上套着一根香肠；嘴里叼着两根香烟……。月末的样子就不同了：衣服兜儿都翻过来，连一张饭票也找不到了，愁眉苦脸地站在食堂里发呆。
    小杜越看脸越红。我问他：
    “这幅画画得怎么样？”
    “简直画绝了！”小杜又把画重端详了一番，低声地说：“白师傅，画里的人不是我，可是他有点像我……”
    “你愿意看就把它拿去吧，也给大家看看，这幅画对我们都有好处哇！”我说。
    午后，杜宝山的情绪变了。苏联专家关于改进烧炉方法的一项建议，许多人嫌麻烦，没有好好地贯彻，可是小杜试验起来。这样，他烧的料又好又快，同样的活，今天比往日多干了二十七个。
    下班了。我在回家的路上自问自答地想着：假如我不问缘由就批评小杜一顿，结果会怎样呢？我看说不定今天我们要少干二十七个活。假如我知道了他没有饭票而不去帮助他解决，就拿漫画去讽刺他，去训他花钱没有计划性，那会怎样呢？他一定这样说：“去你的吧，宣传是不顶饭吃的！”他绝不会说“画里的人有点像我”。……我越想越觉得支部书记常向我们党员、宣传员说的那句话是很对的：
    “只有关心人，才能说服人。”
    “邮递员的故事”
    近来，我发现我们的工作场地很混乱，没有把所有的工具、零件、原料都有秩序地安置在使用方便的地方。工作中常常因为寻找工具浪费很多时间。这是影响劳动生产率的一个重要原因，也是不符合文明生产的要求的。
    为了消除这种现象，我利用午休时间，召开了一个座谈会。座谈会一开始，我先给大家讲了一个邮递员的故事。
    平日里，我特别喜欢搜集好的寓言故事。邮递员的故事，就是从我日常所积累的材料中挑选出来的。这个故事的内容是这样：从前有一个邮递员，他在送信以前从不把信件按地址分别拣开。他说这样做太麻烦。他送起信来就是这样子：从邮袋里随手抽出一封信，看看地址：“第三十五号房间”，是在这座楼房的四层楼，就送去了。又抽出第二封信：“第五号房间”，是在一层楼，于是他从四层楼跑下来，送去了。可是下一封信又在四层楼上，他只好又跑上楼去了。这位邮递员就是这样跑来跑去地送信。
    当我讲完这个故事的时候，大家都哈哈大笑起来。有的说：“这哪像邮递员，简直是条笨牛！”有的说：“现在若有这样的邮递员，非撤他的职不可。”我接着说：“大家不要笑，在我们小组里就有像这位邮递员的人！”
    这时，会场立刻就鸦雀无声了，大家都莫名其妙地互相瞅着。隔了一会儿，有一个人问我：
    “白师傅，你快说说我们哪点像他呢？”
      “你们看看吧！”我用手指着那些乱七八糟放在地上的工具、零件、料头……，说：“我们一时用不着的东西，放在身旁碍手碍脚，可是马上要用的东西，反倒放在远处。为找一件工具，一会儿跑到这里，一会儿跑到那里，如果把这些白白浪费掉的时间加在一起算一算，我们少干了多少活呀！大家想一想，我们跟这个邮递员有什么不同？”
    这个比喻引起大家纷纷议论：“说的对呀！我们就像这个倒霉的邮递员呀！”“我们的毛病比这个邮递员还严重！”我马上站起来向大家说：
    “好吧，现在咱们就来讨论讨论，怎样来克服这个毛病吧！”
    于是，我们热烈地讨论了怎样做好生产前的准备工作，怎样加强工作的计划性，怎样保持工作地的清洁整齐，等等。大家一致提出：保证不当那样的邮递员。　（傅墨　刘建邦记）
