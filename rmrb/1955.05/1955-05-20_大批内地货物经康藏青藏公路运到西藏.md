Since the complete opening of the Kang-Tibet Highway and the Qing-Tibet Highway, more than 900 tons of goods from the motherland's interior have been transported to Lhasa, Qamdo, Heihe, and other places via these two highways. This represents an increase of approximately tenfold compared to the same period last year. The prices of goods in major towns have decreased by about 10% compared to before the highways were opened. Among these goods, besides tea, silk, and hada scarves favored by the Tibetan people, there are also iron production tools and industrial products such as cloth and daily-use furniture. The variety of goods has increased by about 400 types compared to before the opening of the highways.

Before the highways reached Lhasa, mainland industrial products were only sold in the Qamdo area and Lhasa city. Now, the people of Xigaze can also buy knitted goods from Tianjin, silk from Hangzhou, and rubber shoes from Shanghai. The people in the Heihe pastoral area can buy cotton cloth and cigarettes produced in Xi'an and Lanzhou. This spring, state-owned trading companies supplied more than 300 bolts of cloth, more than 500 wool shears, and a portion of grain to the herdsmen in the Tanggula mountain area. The state-owned Tibet Trading Company has also transported the first batch of mainland goods to the remote Ali area. State-owned trading organizations in Lhasa, Xigaze, Heihe, and Gyantse have added wholesale businesses. Tibetan merchants are taking goods from the mainland to Zêtang, the economic center of Shannan Prefecture, and Lhatse, upstream of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, for sale.

In the first quarter of this year, state-owned trading organizations and Tibetan merchants in Qamdo, Dingqing, and Heihe purchased more than 200,000 jin of wool and various medicinal materials and hides worth more than 90,000 yuan. Trade organizations in Lhasa, Xigaze, and other places are also preparing to purchase animal products and local specialties and have raised the purchasing prices of animal products and local products.

The exchange of goods between various regions on the Kang-Tibet Plateau is also becoming increasingly active. This spring, lake salt produced in the Heihe area began to be transported in large quantities to areas lacking salt, such as Bomi and Gongbu. Tibetan carpets, pulu woolen fabric, and other wool textiles produced in Gyantse, Shannan, and other places are transported to the Qamdo area. The mule caravans that originally traveled on the Kang-Tibet road have switched to transportation routes west of Lhasa, greatly facilitating trade between remote areas and various towns.

### 大批内地货物经康藏青藏公路运到西藏

　　大批内地货物经康藏青藏公路运到西藏
    康藏公路和青藏公路全线通车以来，从这两条公路运到拉萨、昌都、黑河等地的祖国内地货物已达九百多吨，比去年同一时期增加了十倍左右。各主要城镇的物价比通车前降低了百分之十左右。这些货物中，除藏族人民喜爱的茶叶、绸缎、哈达以外，还有铁质的生产工具和布匹、日用家具等工业品。货物的品种比通车前增加约四百种。
    公路通车拉萨以前，内地工业品仅销到昌都地区和拉萨市。现在，日喀则人民也能买到天津的针织品、杭州的绸缎和上海的胶鞋。黑河牧区的人民可以买到西安和兰州等地出产的棉布和香烟。今年春天，国营贸易公司向唐古拉山区的牧民供应了三百多匹布、五百多把羊毛剪和一部分粮食。国营西藏贸易公司还向遥远的阿里地区运出了第一批内地货物。拉萨、日喀则、黑河和江孜等地国营贸易机构增添了批发业务。藏族商人带着内地货物到山南区经济中心泽当和雅鲁藏布江上游的拉孜等地销售。
    今年第一季度，昌都、丁青、黑河三地国营贸易机构和藏族商人，收购了二十多万斤羊毛和价值九万多元的各种药材、皮张。拉萨、日喀则等地贸易机构也在准备收购畜产品和土产特产品。并提高了畜产品和土产品的收购价格。
    康藏高原各地区间的物资交流也日趋活跃。今年春天，黑河地区出产的湖盐，开始大量运销到缺盐的波密、工布等地。江孜、山南等地出产的藏毯、氆氇等毛织品运销到昌都地区。原来往返在康藏道上的骡帮，转到拉萨以西的运输线上以后，大大便利了边远地区和各城镇间的贸易。
