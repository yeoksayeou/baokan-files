Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, May 14th: In recent days, the people of Lüshun have warmly seen off batches of Soviet troops returning home.

　　On the afternoon of the 11th, a farewell meeting was held at Lüshun Railway Station. Before parting, representatives of the Chinese troops held a farewell reception inside the station to entertain the Soviet army representatives. More than a thousand people who came to bid farewell had been waiting at the station early. When the Soviet troops entered the station, the well-wishers scattered colorful confetti on them, and the Chinese and Soviet soldiers shook hands warmly in farewell. The Yangko team organized by residents of the First District performed for the Soviet troops. The children of Lüshun Kindergarten specially gave their beloved rag dolls, kittens, puppies and other toys to the Soviet children. The people who came to say goodbye all wished their Soviet friends a safe journey.

　　Since May 5th, the people of Lüshun have held a series of farewell meetings. Representatives from various factories, enterprises, organizations, schools, street residents, and Chinese troops were selected to see them off at the station. More than four hundred farmers from Longtou Village in the Sixth District of Lüshun gathered at Longtou Station on the 6th to bid farewell to the returning Soviet troops. The farmers, young and old, came to see the Soviet troops off. Grandma Jiang Guizhi gave twenty-two boiled eggs to the child of a Soviet officer. Soviet officers and soldiers warmly shook hands with the Chinese farmers in farewell.

Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, May 14th: The first Soviet army unit to enter the Lüshunkou area ten years ago has recently withdrawn to its country.

　　This unit, during the Soviet Patriotic War, together with other Soviet troops, captured Berlin. Soon after, they were transferred to the Far Eastern Front to participate in the war against Japan. On the evening of August 22, 1945, in coordination with tank units and the navy, they liberated Dalian and Lüshun Port, which were occupied by Japanese invaders. Ten years ago, the people of the Lüshunkou area lined the streets to welcome this Soviet army unit that liberated them. Today, ten years later, the people of Lüshun are warmly seeing off this unit on its glorious return home.

　　Before returning home, the commander of this unit told reporters his thoughts and impressions of his ten years in China. He said: When fighting the Japanese invaders on Chinese soil ten years ago, and during the ten years of stationing in the Lüshunkou area to carry out the mission of defending peace, the Chinese people everywhere extended a hand of friendship to the Soviet army. The Chinese people warmly cared for the Soviet army in every way, helping the Soviet army to complete its glorious mission. He said: We will never forget the warm and friendly visits paid to the Soviet army twice by the Chinese government delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Peng Dehuai. We will also always remember the kind feelings shown by the people of Lüda and the entire Chinese people to the Soviet army before their departure. He mentioned that before their departure, they received gifts from the Chinese people from all over the country, including a painting of friendship from coal miners in Liaoyang and two boxes of eggs sent by members of the Xingguang Agricultural Production Cooperative from Chairman Mao's hometown. In their letter, members of the Xingguang Agricultural Production Cooperative said: Although we have never met and we are thousands of miles apart, our hearts will always be connected. He finally told reporters: The Soviet army is very grateful for and cherishes this lofty trust and friendship of the Chinese people. In the great cause of defending peace in the future, we will never fail to live up to their trust and friendship in us.

　　At the farewell, Lüshun Railway Station was crowded with people. The station was filled with the sound of gongs and drums, and people presented bouquets of flowers and packages of gifts to the commander and soldiers of this unit. Colorful paper flowers were scattered on the heads and bodies of the Soviet troops. Until the train started, people were still reluctantly waving goodbye to these friends who had been together for ten years.

　　旅顺市人民热烈欢送苏军回国
    新华社旅大十四日电　连日来，旅顺市人民热烈地欢送一批批陆续回国的苏联军队。
    十一日下午，在旅顺车站举行了一次欢送会。临别前，中国部队代表在车站内举行欢送酒会招待苏军代表。一千多名欢送的人很早就在车站等候。当苏军部队进入车站时，欢送的人向他们身上撒彩色纸屑，中苏战士们热烈握手告别。第一区街道居民组织的秧歌队，给苏军作了表演。旅顺幼儿园的孩子们特地把自己心爱的小布人、小猫、小狗等玩具送给苏联的小朋友。欢送的人们都祝苏联朋友们一路平安。
    从五月五日以来，旅顺市人民连续举行欢送会。各工厂、企业、机关、团体、学校、街道居民和中国部队都选派代表到车站送行。旅顺市第六区龙头村的四百多个农民，六日在龙头车站集会欢送苏军回国。农民们扶老携幼地赶来给苏军送行。蒋桂枝老大娘把煮好的二十二枚鸡蛋送给一位苏联军官的孩子。苏军官兵们同中国农民们热烈地握手告别。
    新华社旅大十四日电　十年前最先进入旅顺口地区的一支苏联陆军部队已在最近撤退回国。
    这支部队在苏联卫国战争时期，曾和其他苏联军队一起攻克了柏林。不久，他们又被调到远东前线参加对日作战。一九四五年八月二十二日黄昏，在坦克部队和海军的配合下，解放了在日寇占领下的大连市和旅顺港。十年前，旅顺口地区人民夹道欢迎了这支解放他们的苏军部队。十年后的今天，旅顺人民又热烈地欢送这支部队光荣回国。
    这支部队的指挥官在回国前夕向记者叙述了十年来他在中国的感想和印象。他说：十年前在中国的土地上和日寇作战的时候，和十年来驻防在旅顺口地区执行保卫和平事业的任务的期间，中国人民到处都向苏军伸出了友谊的手。中国人民从各方面热情地关怀着苏军，帮助苏联军队完成光荣的任务。他说：我们将永远忘不了周恩来总理和彭德怀副总理率领的中国政府代表团两次对苏军进行的热烈而友好的慰问。我们也将永远记住旅大人民和全中国人民在临别前对苏军所表现的亲切感情。他谈到他们在临走前，收到了中国人民从各地寄来的礼物，其中有辽阳的推煤工人送来的友谊画，毛主席故乡的星光农业生产合作社社员寄来的两箱鸡蛋等等。星光农业生产合作社社员们在来信中说：我们虽然没有见过面，我们虽然距离数千里远，但是，我们彼此的心却永远是相连在一起的。他最后对记者说：苏军非常感谢和珍贵中国人民这种崇高的信赖和友谊。在今后保卫和平的伟大事业中，我们绝不会辜负他们对我们的这种信赖和友谊。
    在送别的时候，旅顺车站挤满了人群。车站上锣鼓喧天，人们把一束束的鲜花、一包包的礼物送给这支部队的指挥官和士兵。五彩缤纷的纸花撒在苏军的头上和身上。直到列车开动了，人们还依依不舍地向这些相处十年的朋友招手道别。
