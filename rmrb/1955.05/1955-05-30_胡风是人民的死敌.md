　　Hu Feng is a Deadly Enemy of the People
　　Feng Yidai
　　For more than ten years, I have personally witnessed the Party comrades' concern for Hu Feng, giving him various kinds of help in life and work; even when seriously criticizing his anti-Marxist erroneous ideas, they still took care of his health and his emotions, hoping that he could seriously recognize his mistakes and truly correct them. This concern and care were by no means personal sentimentality, but the Party's concern and care for an intellectual. I still clearly remember the face he put on, acting deeply grateful. However, Hu Feng called these comrades "officials" and "masters," treating them with an attitude of "smiles concealing contempt"!
　　Hu Feng opposed the Party and non-Party progressive literary workers more fiercely than Kuomintang secret agents. Shanghai's drama workers waged arduous struggles against Kuomintang reactionaries to stage Chen Baichen's "Officialdom Unmasked"; magazines and newspapers broke through the various difficulties of secret agent censorship to publish some literary works opposing the reactionary rule of the US-Chiang clique; but Hu Feng instructed his group of lackeys to use open and covert wall posters and mimeographed newspapers to insult and attack these works. These open and covert wall posters and mimeographed newspapers once caused ideological confusion among the student masses in Shanghai at the time; when someone raised this matter with Hu Feng, he vaguely said that it was to rectify the literary scene.
　　In the few years after liberation, Hu Feng's attacks on the Party, on the one hand, used methods of infiltrating and luring people out to expand his strength, used methods of probing and stealing to collect information and Party documents, used code names and secret languages to issue orders, and used the method of stealing letterhead and envelopes from revolutionary organs to deceive people; on the other hand, he told his lackeys to "abide by organizational principles" to "ensure the struggle." What difference is there between Hu Feng's approach and the methods used by US-Chiang secret agents? Hu Feng instructed his group of lackeys to use false self-criticisms to cover up their retreat, to "seek rebirth in suffering." What was the "opportunity" for "rebirth" that he demanded?
　　The matter is already clear! Hu Feng is a deadly enemy of the Party and the people. His attempt is to restore the reactionary regime, making the Chinese people forever fall into a bottomless abyss.

　　胡风是人民的死敌
　　冯亦代
    十多年来，我曾经亲眼看到党内同志对于胡风的关怀，在生活和工作方面给予他种种帮助；甚至在严肃批评了他的反马克思主义的错误思想的时候，也还是照顾到他的健康，他的情绪，希冀他能够认真认识自己错误，真正改正过来。这些关怀和照顾决不是个人的温情，而是党对于一个知识分子的关怀和照顾。我还清楚地记得他那副作衷心感激状的脸嘴。然而，胡风对这些同志们却称之为“官们”、“老爷们”，用“微笑包着侮蔑”的态度来对待！
    胡风比国民党特务更凶恶地反对党和非党的进步文学工作者。上海的戏剧工作者对国民党反动派特务进行了艰苦的斗争，才能上演陈白尘的“升官图”；杂志报刊突破了特务检查的种种留难，才能刊登一些反对美蒋反动统治的文学作品；可是胡风却指使他那集团的喽啰们，用公开的和不公开的墙报和油印报，对这些作品进行了侮蔑和攻击。这种公开的和不公开的墙报和油印报曾经在当时的上海学生群众中造成了思想混乱；有人向胡风提出这件事时，他却含含糊糊地说是要严肃文坛。
    解放后几年来，胡风对党的进攻，一方面用打进来、拉出去的方法来扩充实力，用探听和盗窃的方法来收集情况和党内文件，用代号隐语来发号施令，用盗用革命机关的信纸信封的办法来混人耳目；另一方面则是要喽啰们“遵守组织原则”来“保证斗争”。胡风的这种做法和美蒋特务所用的方法又有什么不同之处呢？胡风指使他那集团的喽啰们用假检讨掩护退却，要“在忍受中求得重生”，他所要求“重生”的“时机”又是什么呢？
    事情已经清清楚楚了！胡风是党和人民的死敌，他的企图是要使反动政权复辟，使中国人民永远沦于不复的地步。
