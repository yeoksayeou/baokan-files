American Colonialists are Alarmed
　　Feng Zhidan

    On May 18th, the "Voice of America," the mouthpiece of the U.S. State Department, shamelessly distorted the Asian-African Conference's resolution against colonialism, attempting to portray the socialist system as a "manifestation" of colonialism.

    However, Washington's eagerness to divert the Asian-African people's opposition to colonialism only demonstrates the American colonialists' fear and unease, which no slander or defamation can conceal.

    Colonialism can have various manifestations, but there is and can only be one colonialism, that is, the aggression, plunder, and exploitation of backward countries by advanced capitalist countries, causing them to lose independence and sovereignty to varying degrees, their economies to remain stagnant and backward for a long time, and their people to live in extreme poverty. The root of colonialism is the capitalist system. It arises and develops on the basis of capitalism. From the Gold Coast to the Philippine Islands, from the jungles of Brazil to the Chinese mainland, colonialism is deeply imprinted everywhere. To compete for colonies, several capitalist countries constantly waged wars against each other. The two world wars were caused by the fact that capitalism had developed to its highest stage in order to redivide colonies and re-apportion monopoly markets, raw material producing areas and investment sites.

    In terms of the manifestations of colonialism, they are various. Moreover, as the awakening of the people of the colonies and dependent countries rises, colonialism becomes more and more cruel and vicious, and at the same time, it tries its best to conceal itself. In this regard, the United States is such a colonialist country.

    People can easily cite various manifestations of American colonialism. When the United States first devoted itself to encompassing the Americas, it manifested itself as the "Monroe Doctrine," and when the United States began to demand a share of colonial interests in China with other colonialist countries, it manifested itself as the "Open Door Policy" and the "Stimson Doctrine." When economic penetration and political control were hindered, the U.S. Marines repeatedly entered the territory of Latin American countries to maintain and expand the colonial interests of U.S. monopoly capital there; and in order to seize the Philippines as a colony, the United States launched a real war against Spain, and then drowned the Filipino people who demanded independence in a pool of blood.

    After World War II, with the decline of the status of other colonial countries, the American colonialists, harboring ambitions to dominate the world, carried out activities on a larger scale and with more diverse manifestations. As many countries were in economic difficulties due to war and other reasons, the U.S. dollar was used as a pioneer to expand the colonial forces of Wall Street. American economic "aid" has caused many countries to lose independence and sovereignty to varying degrees, and their national economies and national industries have been undermined. Subsequently, "collective defense" was used as an excuse to realize U.S. military control over other countries, turning them into bases for American colonialists to carry out aggression and launch wars. One and a half million American armed forces are stationed at nearly a thousand military bases outside the United States. These military bases have become fortresses for suppressing the national independence movements of the people of backward countries in many regions. Even in Japan, the United States still implements a semi-military occupation system, cruelly enslaving and exploiting the Japanese people. Subversive activities have been raised to the level of policy by American colonialists, using them as a means to deal with countries that are not controlled by it or unwilling to be completely enslaved by its instructions. Everyone knows how the United States used methods to overthrow the democratic government of Guatemala and protect the colonial position of U.S. monopoly capital there. British Labour Party MP Mikardo said it well: "The war waged by the United States to establish the United Fruit Company in Guatemala is exactly the same in nature as the war that Britain once waged to establish the East India Company in India." Recently, because of opposition to the American colonialist military bloc plan in the Middle East, Colonel Anand Maliki, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Syrian Army, was assassinated, and the behind-the-scenes instigator of the assassination was the United States. There are countless examples of this kind.

    American colonialists like to use the "independence" that the United States gave to the Philippines to disguise themselves. But just listen to what Philippine Senator Recto has to say, and the truth will be clear. According to a United Press report, this "independently-minded" Philippine senator said sarcastically on the 16th: "When we were a commonwealth, we were more independent than we are today." He said that the United States controls every important policy in the Philippines. This is an indisputable explanation of the "independence" granted by the United States. As for the Chinese people, they have a particularly painful experience of American colonialism. The American colonial army has come to China many times to show off its power. American monopoly capital, through its Kuomintang agents, has controlled all of China's economic lifelines, plundered China's resources, and squeezed the blood and sweat of the Chinese people; now American colonialists are still occupying China's territory of Taiwan, and are trying their best to subvert the People's Republic of China in order to restore its colonial rule on the Chinese mainland.

    The United States uses various methods to obtain political and economic privileges in other countries, export capital to vast areas of the world, plunder and exploit, and actively squeeze out the forces of other colonialists, attempting to establish a Wall Street world-wide colonial empire. Such a colonialist shamelessly often disguises himself as a warrior who supports the independence aspirations of the people of the colonies and dependent countries!

    The Asian-African Conference condemned all manifestations of colonialism, which precisely hit the pain of American colonialism through its hypocritical appearance. The "Voice of America" hurriedly wanted to portray socialist countries as another form of colonialism, which, in addition to showing that the Asian-African Conference's condemnation of colonialism made American colonialists very uneasy, could not prove anything else. What does it mean to implement socialism in a country? This first of all means overthrowing the rule of capitalism. In this way, it also eradicates the foundation for the emergence of colonialism. The principle of socialist foreign policy is peaceful coexistence of different systems. The basis of international relations between socialist countries is friendly cooperation, equality and mutual benefit, and seeking common economic prosperity. This has been confirmed by many facts about the foreign relations and internal development of socialist camp countries, and cannot be changed by the "Voice of America"'s distorted propaganda and slander.

    The American propaganda machine focuses on slandering communism, which particularly reflects the hostility of the Washington ruling clique towards peaceful and democratic countries that have eradicated colonialism. When the "Voice of America" expressed sorrow for "in the past fifteen years... seven hundred and forty million people who once enjoyed freedom have fallen under communist rule," people smelled a strong colonialist atmosphere. Obviously, the so-called "freedom" in the eyes of the United States is the "freedom" for the United States to oppress and exploit these people through its agents, the freedom of the colonialists. What "freedom" did the Chinese people enjoy in the past? That is, the flood of American surplus commodities sucking our blood, American-made planes and artillery destroying our rural areas and cities everywhere, the agents of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" relentlessly killing our youth day and night, American soldiers raping Chinese women lawlessly in Hankou and Beijing, and the obscene books and newspapers of the United States Information Service and Hollywood's murder movies drowning our culture... The Chinese people will always remember the kind of "freedom" that American colonialism brought us. They have resolutely rejected this "freedom" of poverty, hunger, and enslavement. After a long period of struggle, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, finally overthrew the rule of imperialism and its agents and embarked on the road of true independence, freedom, and prosperity. The situation in other people's democratic countries is also the same. This fact itself is the most eloquent.

    From the Pacific Ocean to the Elbe River, over 900 million people have thoroughly and permanently eradicated colonialism on more than one-third of the world's land, making it impossible for Western colonialists to plunder and exploit this large population from this vast land. This is the real reason why the American propaganda machine and its echo bugs viciously attack communism. But no matter how furious Washington's colonialists are, here more than 900 million people are building their beautiful and happy lives with confidence, especially the great Soviet people, who have now entered the historical period of communist construction with big strides. They are using the beautiful reality they have created to point out to the people of the world a correct path towards true freedom and a happy life.

    In accordance with the socialist spirit of national founding, the Soviet Union, China, and all people's democratic countries have consistently sympathized with and unconditionally supported the struggle of all oppressed nations in the world against colonial rule and all manifestations of colonialism. They are the deadly enemies of world colonialism. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are loyal defenders of the interests of colonial peoples at United Nations conferences. Their representatives solemnly condemn colonialism and support every just demand of oppressed nations. Because they have only recently gained independence and freedom, the Chinese people can particularly appreciate the deep pain that colonialism is inflicting on all colonial and dependent countries, and extend unlimited sympathy and support to their heroic struggles. This position stands in sharp contrast to the hypocritical attitude of the United States and other colonial countries, which on the one hand talk about giving independence to the people of the colonies and dependent countries, while on the other hand brutally suppressing the independence movements of various countries.

    The Asian-African Conference condemned colonialism, and this important result was achieved through the joint efforts of the People's Republic of China and the vast majority of participating countries. It is futile for American colonialists to distort the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference. American colonialism cannot escape the condemnation of the Asian-African people.

### 美国殖民主义者惊慌了

　　美国殖民主义者惊慌了
　　冯之丹
    五月十八日美国国务院的喉舌“美国之音”的广播对亚非会议关于反对殖民主义的决议进行了无耻的歪曲，力图把社会主义制度说成是殖民主义的一种“表现”。
    但是，华盛顿这样急切地要来转移亚非人民反对殖民主义的锋芒，正好说明了美国殖民主义者的惶恐与不安，这是任何诬蔑和毁谤都不可能掩盖得住的。
    殖民主义可以有各种表现，但殖民主义只有一个也只能有一个，那就是资本主义先进国家对落后国家的侵略、掠夺和剥削，使它们在不同程度上丧失独立和主权，经济长期处于停滞、落后的状态，人民生活陷于极端贫困。殖民主义的根源就是资本主义制度。它是在资本主义的基础上产生和发展起来的。从黄金海岸到菲律宾群岛，从巴西的丛林到中国大陆，到处都深刻着殖民主义的烙印。为了争夺殖民地，几个资本主义国家还相互间不断进行战争。两次世界大战，就是资本主义发展到最高阶段时为了重新分割殖民地，重新瓜分垄断市场、原料产地和投资场所而发生的。
    从殖民主义的表现来说，那是各种各样的。而且随着殖民地、附属国人民觉醒的高涨，殖民主义也愈来愈残酷，愈来愈狠毒，同时，它还竭力要把自己掩盖起来。在这一方面，美国就是一个这样的殖民主义国家。
    人们可以轻易地举出美国殖民主义的各种表现。当美国首先致力于囊括美洲时，它表现为“门罗主义”，而当美国开始要求和其他殖民主义国家分沾在中国的殖民利益时，它又表现为“门户开放政策”、“史汀生主义”了。在经济渗入和政治控制受到阻碍时，美国海军陆战队曾经多次开进拉丁美洲国家的领土，维护和扩大美国垄断资本在那里的殖民利益；而为了抢夺菲律宾这块殖民地，美国曾对西班牙发动了真正的战争，接着又把要求独立的菲律宾人民淹在血泊中。
    在第二次大战以后，随着其他殖民国家地位的衰落，美国殖民主义者怀着独霸世界的野心，它的活动规模更大，表现也更加多样了。由于许多国家因战争及其他原因陷于经济的困境，美元被作为扩展华尔街殖民势力的开路先锋。美国的经济“援助”使得许多国家，在不同程度上丧失了独立和主权，它们的国民经济和民族工业受到破坏。接着，“共同防御”又被用作借口来实现美国对其他国家的军事控制，把它们变作美国殖民主义者进行侵略和发动战争的基地。有一百五十万美国武装部队驻扎在美国国外的将近一千个军事基地上。这些军事基地，在许多地区成了镇压落后国家人民争取民族独立运动的堡垒。甚至在日本，迄今美国也仍实行着半军事占领制度，异常残酷地奴役和剥削着日本人民。颠覆活动被美国殖民主义者提高到了政策的水平，把它作为对付不受它控制或者不愿完全受其奴役指使的国家的手段。美国用什么办法来推翻危地马拉民主的政府、保护美国垄断资本在那里的殖民地位，是人所共知的。英国工党议员米卡多说得对：“美国为了在危地马拉设立联合果品公司而进行的战争，和英国为了在印度设立东印度公司而曾一度进行过的战争，完全是同一性质的”。最近，因为反对美国的中东殖民主义军事集团计划，叙利亚的陆军副参谋长阿南德·马利基上校遭到了暗杀，暗杀的幕后指使人就是美国。这一类的事情是不胜枚举的。
    美国殖民主义者最喜欢拿美国给了菲律宾“独立”来替自己掩饰。但是只要听听菲律宾的参议员雷克托是怎样说的，事实的真相就明白了。据合众社报道，这个“具有独立思想”的菲律宾议员在十六日用讽刺的语调说：“当初我们是个联邦的时候，我们比今天还独立一些。”他说，美国控制了菲律宾的每一项重要政策。这就是对美国所给予的“独立”的无可非议的解释。至于中国人民，对于美国殖民主义是有特别痛切的体验的，美国殖民主义军队曾经许多次到中国来耀武扬威，美国垄断资本通过它的国民党代理人曾经控制了中国的一切经济命脉，掠夺中国的资源，压榨中国人民的膏脂；现在美国殖民主义者还侵占着中国的领土台湾，并且竭力想颠覆中华人民共和国以恢复它在中国大陆上的殖民统治。
    美国用各种方法，取得在别国的政治、经济的特权，把资本输出到世界广大的地区，进行掠夺和剥削，并积极地排挤其他殖民主义的势力，企图建立华尔街的世界范围的殖民帝国。这样一个殖民主义，却厚颜无耻地经常把自己扮成一个支持殖民地、附属国人民独立愿望的战士！
    亚非会议谴责殖民主义的一切表现，这正透过美国殖民主义的伪善外貌而打击了它的痛处。“美国之音”赶紧想把社会主义国家说成是另一种表现形式的殖民主义，除了表明亚非会议对殖民主义的谴责使美国殖民主义者十分不安，不能证明别的。在一个国家里实行社会主义是什么意思呢？这首先是表示推翻了资本主义的统治。这样它也就铲除了产生殖民主义的根基。社会主义外交政策原则是不同制度和平共处。社会主义国家的国际关系的基础是友好合作，平等互利，求得经济的共同高涨。这已为社会主义阵营国家对外关系和内部发展的许多事实所证实，并不是“美国之音”的歪曲宣传和造谣诬蔑所改变得了的。
    美国宣传机器集中诬蔑共产主义，这特别反映了华盛顿统治集团对于根绝了殖民主义的和平民主国家的仇视。当“美国之音”为了“在过去十五年中……七亿四千万一度享有自由的人民陷于共产主义统治下”而表示悲哀时，人们就闻到了强烈的殖民主义的气息。显然，美国眼里的所谓“自由”，就是美国能够通过它的代理人对这些人民进行压迫和榨取的“自由”，就是殖民主义者的自由。中国人民在过去曾经享有什么“自由”呢？那就是潮水似的美国剩余商品吸干着我们的膏血，美制飞机大炮到处毁灭我们的农村和城市，“中美合作所”的特务们日夜不息地残杀我们的青年，美国士兵在汉口和北京无法无天地强奸中国妇女，美国新闻处的下流书报和好莱坞的凶杀电影淹没着我们的文化……中国人民永远记得美国殖民主义带给我们的这种“自由”。他们已经坚决地排斥了这种贫困、饥馑和奴役的“自由”。中国人民在经过长期的斗争之后，终于在中国共产党的领导下推翻了帝国主义及其代理人的统治，走上了真正独立、自由和繁荣的道路。其他人民民主国家的情形也是一样。这个事实本身就是最雄辩的。
    从太平洋到易北河，九亿多人民在世界三分之一以上的土地上彻底地、而且永远地铲除了殖民主义，使得西方殖民主义者丧失了从这大片土地上对这大量人口的掠夺和剥削的可能。这就是美国宣传机器及其应声虫恶毒地攻击共产主义的真正原因。但是不管华盛顿的殖民主义者如何暴跳如雷，这里九亿多人民正在满怀信心地建设着自己美好幸福的生活，特别是伟大的苏联人民，现在已经大踏步地进入了共产主义建设的历史时期。他们正以他们创造的美好现实向全世界的人民指出了一条走向真正的自由和幸福生活的正确道路。
    苏联、中国和所有人民民主国家本着社会主义的立国精神，一贯地同情和无条件支持世界上一切被压迫民族的反对殖民统治和殖民主义的一切表现的斗争。它们是世界殖民主义的死敌。谁都知道，苏联和人民民主国家在联合国的会议上是殖民地人民利益的忠诚的维护者，他们的代表严正地谴责殖民主义，支持被压迫民族的每一个正义要求。中国人民更由于自己新近才获得独立和自由，因此特别能够体会一切殖民地、附属国家人民正在遭受的殖民主义加之于他们的深切痛苦，并对他们的英勇斗争寄予无限的同情和支持。这种立场同美国及其他殖民国家一面高谈给殖民地、附属国人民以独立而同时却残暴地镇压各国人民争取独立运动的伪善态度，形成鲜明的对照。
    亚非会议谴责殖民主义，这一重要的成果正是在中华人民共和国和绝大多数与会国家的共同努力下达成的。美国殖民主义者要想歪曲亚非会议的决议是徒然的。美国的殖民主义是不能逃避亚非人民的声讨的。
