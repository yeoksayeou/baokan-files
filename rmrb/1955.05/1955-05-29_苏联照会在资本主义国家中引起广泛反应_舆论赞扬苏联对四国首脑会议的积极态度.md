Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS: The Soviet government's note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France regarding the issue of convening a four-power summit has elicited widespread reactions in many Western countries.

　　Editorials in the "New York Times" and the "New York Herald Tribune" had to acknowledge the importance of this meeting for the cause of peace and expressed unease about the passage in the Soviet note that pointed out the United States' attitude toward the meeting and another passage addressed to the British and French governments. An Associated Press dispatch from Washington said that no official was willing to comment on the Soviet government's note regarding the United States' attitude toward the meeting.

　　Reuters commentator Stanley Priddle reported that London officials welcomed the Soviet Union's formal expression of agreement to hold a "top-level" meeting. Priddle mentioned that a Foreign Office spokesman said that the Soviet note would be studied jointly with France and the United States. "The Times" speculated: "The main agenda [of the meeting] will probably be the issues of disarmament (including nuclear weapons and conventional armaments) and European security (including the issue of restoring German unification)."

　　British newspapers also paid close attention to the evaluation in the note of certain remarks by leaders of the United States government. The "Manchester Guardian" believes that the Western countries' claim that Vienna, in its still formally occupied state, is not suitable for holding a four-power summit is not entirely convincing.

　　Paris's "Le Figaro" said that disagreements on the issue of the meeting location should not delay or hinder the convening of the meeting.

　　An editorial in "L'Humanité" sharply criticized the remarks made by United States government leaders that hinder the smooth convening of the meeting. The editorial wrote, "Just when developments were showing that a four-power meeting could effectively resolve international disputes, the United States State Department began to back down and undermine this work that is so important for guaranteeing peace." The newspaper attacked the attempt by United States political leaders to crudely interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign countries. It said, "If they insist on such a formulation on this issue, then their Western allies, who fear public opinion's censure, will not follow them."

　　West Berlin newspapers generally expressed satisfaction and emphasized the Soviet government's positive attitude toward convening a four-power summit.

　　The Dutch "Het Volk" said in its headline: "American attitude is a threat to success." "De Telegraaf" quoted the Soviet government's warning that all attempts at interference are inadmissible and must be rejected.

　　苏联照会在资本主义国家中引起广泛反应
　  舆论赞扬苏联对四国首脑会议的积极态度
    据新华社讯据塔斯社讯：苏联政府就召开四国政府首脑会议问题给美、英、法三国政府的照会，在许多西方国家里引起了广泛的反应。
      “纽约时报”和“纽约先驱论坛报”的社论不得不承认这个会议对于和平事业的重要性，并且对苏联照会中指出美国对这个会议的态度的一段话和另外对英法两国政府说的一段话感到不安。美联社华盛顿消息说，没有一个官方人物愿意就苏联政府照会中关于美国对会议的态度的话加以评论。
      路透社评论员斯坦莱·普里德尔报道说，伦敦官方人士欢迎苏联正式表示同意举行“最高级”会议。普里德尔提到，外交部发言人说，将同法国和美国共同研究苏联的照会。“泰晤士报”推测说：“（会议的）主要议程大概是裁军（包括核子武器和常规军备）和欧洲安全（包括恢复德国统一问题）问题。”
    英国各报也十分注意照会中对美国政府领袖的一些言论的评价。“曼彻斯特卫报”认为，西方国家提出的所谓维也纳形式上仍旧是被占领的领土因而不适于举行四国首脑会议的说法，是不能令人十分信服的。
    巴黎“费加罗报”说，在会议地点问题上发生的分歧不应该拖延或者妨碍会议的召开。
    “人道报”社论尖锐地批评美国政府领袖发表的妨碍顺利举行会议的言论。社论写道，“当事情的发展刚刚表明四大国会议能够有效地解决国际纠纷问题的时候，美国国务院就开始向后退，并且来破坏这一对保障和平十分重要的工作。这家报纸抨击美国政治首脑人物妄想粗暴干涉主权国家内政的企图。它说：“如果他们在这问题上坚持这样的提法，那么他们的那些害怕舆论责难的西方盟国，就不会跟着他们跑。”
    西柏林报纸普遍满意地着重指出苏联政府对召开四国首脑会议采取的积极态度。
    荷兰“人民报”在标题中说：“美国的态度是成功的威胁”。“电讯报”援引苏联政府的警告说：一切干涉的企图都是不能容许的，必须加以摒斥。
