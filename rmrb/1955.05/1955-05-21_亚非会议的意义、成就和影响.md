　　The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung concluded on April 24th. This international conference, the first of its kind convened by Asians and Africans without the participation of Western colonial powers, has ended, but its profound influence is gradually penetrating every country and corner of Asia and Africa.

　　What is the great historical significance of the Asian-African Conference? Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the Asian-African Conference: "This conference was held by Asian and African countries eager to take control of their own destiny without the participation of Western colonial powers. It reflects the common aspirations and demands of the Asian and African people, who account for more than half of the world's population." Asia and Africa are the world's two largest continents. Their people are intelligent and hardworking, and they have developed brilliant cultures in the past. In modern times, the people of Asia and Africa have suffered under the colonial rule of imperialism, enduring destruction and oppression, living as slaves, suffering racial discrimination and persecution, losing political independence and autonomy, and falling into poverty and backwardness economically and culturally. Under colonial rule, our fate was at the mercy of others, and our wishes and voices were ignored. World affairs were decided in London, Paris, and Washington, and the people of Asia and Africa had no right to speak. Since World War II, the face of Asia and Africa has undergone tremendous changes. The people of some countries have already stood up and broken free from the shackles of imperialism; the people of other countries are waging heroic struggles to break free from the shackles of imperialism. The days when Europeans and Americans dominated the fate of the people of Asia and Africa are gone forever. The people of Asia and Africa have awakened and are determined to be masters of their own destiny. The Asian-African Conference reflects this profound historical change.

　　Secondly, the great significance of the Asian-African Conference also lies in the fact that it provided an opportunity for representatives from twenty-nine countries, comprising more than half of the world's population, to gather together to discuss issues of mutual concern, enhance understanding and friendship, and strengthen cooperation and solidarity. Because the people of Asia and Africa have experienced common historical experiences, suffered the same imperialist aggression, and endured the same colonial exploitation and oppression, they have a common foundation and common aspirations for mutual understanding. Despite all the obstructions and sabotage by imperialism, the Asian-African Conference has, after all, substantially fulfilled the ardent expectations of the Asian and African people.

　　Finally, the great significance of the Asian-African Conference also lies in the fact that it proved that peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is possible. The twenty-nine countries participating in the conference have different social systems, different ideologies, different religious beliefs, and different languages, but they were ultimately able to reach unanimous agreements on many major issues. This proves that as long as the countries concerned are willing to abide by the basic principles of peaceful coexistence, peaceful coexistence is entirely possible not only between Asian and African countries, but also between other countries in the world.

　　These historical achievements of the Asian-African Conference are specifically embodied in its final communiqué. Considering that the time was only a short seven days, considering the large number of participating countries and the complexity of the situation, and considering the sharp struggles in the international situation and the imperialist conspiracies to undermine the conference in every possible way, the agreements reached at the conference are obviously of great significance. In the communiqué, the sincere and ardent sentiments of the Asian and African people, such as the demand for easing international tensions, opposition to war, support for peace, opposition to colonial rule, opposition to racial discrimination, the hope to promote international friendly cooperation, and the improvement of economic and cultural levels through mutual cooperation, have all been expressed. The conference declared that colonialism in all its manifestations is an "evil" that should be eradicated quickly. The Asian and African people, who have suffered deeply from the scourge of colonial rule, believe that colonialism, whether manifested in political domination, economic plunder, cultural destruction, or military control, is impermissible and must be eradicated. The conference affirmed that the subjection, domination, and exploitation of peoples by foreign powers is a denial of fundamental human rights, is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations, and therefore demanded that such peoples be granted freedom and independence. The conference specifically demanded that the people of North Africa be given the right to self-determination, supported Indonesia's claim to West Irian, and Yemen's claim to Aden and the southern region of Yemen. The conference condemned the policy of racial discrimination and expressed sympathy and support for the victims of racial discrimination within South Africa. The conference called for the people of Asia and Africa to have more say in international affairs. The Asian and African people, who have suffered the most from the scourge of imperialist wars of aggression for a long time, will certainly play a positive role in maintaining international peace in the future. The communiqué also recorded the urgent calls of the Asian and African people to oppose nuclear war, demand disarmament, and prohibit the production, testing, and use of nuclear weapons. They demanded that atomic energy be used for peaceful purposes. In the last part of the communiqué, the conference put forward ten principles of peaceful coexistence, which are fully in line with the five principles of peaceful coexistence that have already been accepted by several countries in the world.

　　These are certainly not the entire contents of the communiqué, let alone the entire contents of the conference. Premier Zhou's statements on the Taiwan issue, made outside the conference and at the closing meeting of the conference, further enhanced the peaceful atmosphere of the conference. These two statements thoroughly shattered the American conspiracy to poison the atmosphere of the conference by exploiting the tense situation in the Taiwan area. In addition, the joint statement issued by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos, and the treaty on dual nationality signed between China and Indonesia, although not part of the conference itself, greatly contributed to the harmonious atmosphere of the conference, encouraged the upright spirit of sincere consultation, and struck at the conspiracies of division and destruction. These things undoubtedly prove that all international problems can be resolved through negotiation as long as the parties concerned have a desire for peace.

　　The significant role of the conference in cooperation between countries and in world peace was undoubtedly deeply recognized by the participating countries. They unanimously passed a resolution suggesting that the five initiating countries, in consultation with the participating countries, consider convening the next session of the Asian-African Conference. This decision itself is the best proof of the success of the conference.

　　Of course, these fruitful results of the conference were not easily obtained. They were won only after many struggles—struggles against imperialism, first and foremost against American imperialism.

　　The United States engaged in various kinds of sabotage activities against the Bandung Conference. From the very beginning, the reactionary American newspapers spread various rumors about the conference, created "divisions" between the participating countries, spread pessimistic views, and sowed discord between the countries. The United States did not participate in the conference, but it sent a "largest delegation" of seventy American journalists to Bandung to stir up trouble. During the conference, the United States used its "friends" to obstruct it. Dulles' threatening statements about Taiwan during the conference and Eisenhower's proposed $3.53 billion "aid" plan were all part of the conspiracy to undermine the Bandung Conference. On this point, "The Christian Science Monitor" made it very clear, saying that the United States' proposal of a new foreign aid plan at the height of the conference "can hardly be said to be entirely coincidental or unintentional." In addition to all these despicable sabotage activities, of course, no one will forget the bloody crime of the United States colluding with Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents to blow up the plane carrying personnel of our delegation, attempting to assassinate the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai.

　　Despite the many despicable means of sabotage used by the United States, the Asian-African Conference still achieved great success. This was the first conference of the Asian and African people without the participation of Western colonial powers, and the Asian and African people could not allow it to fail. The attempts of the American propaganda machine to downplay the significance of the conference are completely futile. The failure of the American conspiracy of sabotage is the success of the conference, and the success of the conference is the victory of peace-loving countries. This simple truth is very obvious.

　　In analysis, the success of the conference should first be attributed to the irresistible desire of the Asian and African people for peace and for national independence and equality. This is the fundamental factor that propelled the conference in the right direction, eliminated all difficulties, and overcame imperialist obstruction. Secondly, the fact that most of the delegations attending the conference were able to reflect the aspirations of the people, appreciate the great historical significance of the conference, and strive to achieve the broad unity of the Asian and African people was also a necessary condition for the conference to reach unanimous agreements. Furthermore, the spirit of initiative of the Prime Ministers of South Asian countries, especially the efforts of the Indonesian Prime Minister as the host and the Indian Prime Minister to ensure the smooth progress of the conference, was also an important factor in the success of the conference. Finally, no one can deny the significant contribution of the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai to the conference. Based on the Chinese government's consistent foreign policy of safeguarding world peace and promoting international cooperation, the Chinese delegation adhered to its position in Bandung while upholding the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, listening to different opinions, and striving for the greatest unity with a rational attitude. This undoubtedly gave the representatives of the participating countries a profound impression and will provide a good example for future international conferences.

　　The end of the first Asian-African Conference is just a beginning. After this good start, the understanding between the Asian and African people will surely deepen day by day, and the unity will surely become increasingly consolidated and expanded, which will greatly strengthen the forces for world peace and make it difficult for the imperialists' conspiracy to launch a war to succeed.

　　However, the imperialists will never sit idly by and watch the development of the cause of peace, nor will they watch the influence of the Asian-African Conference expand. Therefore, the Chinese people must always be vigilant and work together with the people of Asian and African countries to implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference.

　　亚非会议的意义、成就和影响
　　张奚若
    在万隆举行的亚非会议已于四月二十四日闭幕。有史以来第一次的亚洲和非洲人召开的、没有西方殖民国家参加的国际会议是结束了，但是它的深远的影响正在逐渐地深入到亚洲和非洲的每一个国家和每一个角落。
    亚非会议的伟大历史意义在那里呢？周恩来总理在他向全国人民代表大会常务委员会所作关于亚非会议的报告中已经指出：“这个会议是在没有西方殖民国家的参加下，由渴望掌握自己命运的亚非国家举行的，它反映了占全世界人口一半以上的亚非人民的共同愿望和要求。”亚洲和非洲是世界上两个大洲。它们的人民是智慧的、勤劳的，在过去曾经发展过灿烂的文化。近代以来亚非人民受到了帝国主义的殖民统治，受尽了摧残和压迫，过着奴隶生活，遭受种族歧视和迫害，在政治上失去独立自主，在经济上和文化上陷于贫穷落后。在殖民统治之下，我们的命运听人摆布，我们的愿望、我们的呼声不受重视。世界大事取决于伦敦、巴黎和华盛顿，亚非人民根本没有发言的权利。第二次世界大战以后，亚非地区的面貌起了巨大的变化。有些国家的人民已经站了起来，摆脱了帝国主义的羁绊；另外有些国家的人民正在为挣脱帝国主义的枷锁而进行英勇的斗争。欧洲人和美洲人主宰亚非人民的命运的日子已经一去不复返，亚非人民已经觉醒，坚决要做自己命运的主人。亚非会议反映了这一深刻的历史变化。
    其次，亚非会议的重大意义还在于它提供了机会，使拥有全世界半数以上人口的二十九个国家的代表能够聚集一堂，共同商讨相互有关的问题，增进了解和友谊，加强合作与团结。亚非人民由于经历过共同的历史经验，遭受过同样的帝国主义侵略，蒙受过同样的殖民地掠夺和压迫，因此具有互相了解的共同基础和共同愿望。尽管有帝国主义的百般阻挠和破坏，亚非会议毕竟还是相当地实现了亚非人民对它的热切期望。
    最后，亚非会议的重大意义还在于它证明了不同社会制度的国家和平共处是可能的。参加会议的二十九个国家社会制度不同，思想意识不同，宗教信仰不同，语言文字不同，但它们终能在许多主要问题上达成一致的协议。这就证明：只要有关国家愿意遵守和平共处的基本原则，不但在亚非国家间，就在世界其他国家间，和平共处是完全可能的。
    亚非会议的这些历史性成就具体表现在它的最后公报中。只要想到时间只有短短的七天，只要想到与会国家数目之多、情形之复杂，只要想到国际局势中斗争之尖锐，以及帝国主义千方百计的破坏阴谋，那末会议所达成的协议显然是有重大意义的。在公报中，亚非人民要求缓和国际紧张局势、反对战争、拥护和平、反对殖民统治、反对种族歧视、希望促进国际友好合作并通过彼此合作提高经济文化水平等真诚和热切的情绪，都得到了表达。会议宣布殖民主义在其一切表现中是一种应当迅速予以根除的“祸害”。饱受殖民统治的祸害的亚非人民认为，殖民主义，无论是表现在政治统治、经济掠夺、文化摧残或军事控制上，都是不能许可的，而必须予以根除。会议确认，各国人民受到外国的征服、统治和剥削是对基本人权的否定，并且是违反联合国宪章的，因此要求给予这种人民以自由独立。会议具体地要求给予北非人民以自决权，支持印度尼西亚对西伊里安的要求以及也门对亚丁和也门南部地区的要求。会议谴责了种族歧视政策，并对南非境内种族歧视的受害者表示同情和支持。会议要求亚非人民在国际事务上有更多的发言权。长期遭受帝国主义侵略战争祸害最深的亚非人民，今后对于国际和平的维持，肯定地会发生良好的作用。公报还记载了亚非人民反对核子战争，要求裁减军备，禁止生产、试验和使用核子武器的迫切呼吁。他们要求把原子能用于和平用途。在公报的最后一部分中，会议提出了和平相处的十项原则，这是完全符合世界上若干国家所已经接受的和平共处的五项原则的。
    这些当然不是公报的全部内容，更不是会议的全部内容。周总理在会外及在大会闭幕会议上发表的关于台湾问题的声明，更增加了会议的和平气氛。这两次的声明彻底粉碎了美国企图利用台湾地区的紧张局势毒化会议气氛的阴谋。此外，越南民主共和国和老挝王国发表联合声明及中国和印度尼西亚签订关于双重国籍问题的条约这两件事虽然不是会议本身的一部分，但它们大大有助于会议的融洽气氛，鼓舞了诚恳协商的正气，打击了分裂破坏的阴谋。这些事情无可置疑地证明：一切国际问题，只要有关方面具有和平愿望，是可以协商解决的。
    会议对于各国之间的合作以及对世界和平的重大作用，无疑地为与会各国所深切认识。它们一致通过建议五个发起国在同与会国协商之下考虑召开亚非会议下届会议的问题。这一决定本身就是会议成功的最好证明。
    当然，会议的这些丰硕果实并不是轻易得来的，它是经过许多斗争——对帝国主义，首先是对美帝国主义的斗争——才赢得来的。
    美国对万隆会议的破坏活动是各种各样的。美国反动报刊一开始就散布关于会议的各种谣言，制造与会国家间的“分歧”，散布悲观论调，挑拨各国间的不和。美国没有参加会议，但却派了七十个美国记者组成的“最大的代表团”到万隆去兴风作浪。在会议中，美国通过它的“朋友”进行阻挠。杜勒斯在会议期间发出的关于台湾的恫吓声明和艾森豪威尔提出的三十五亿三千万美元的“援助”计划都是破坏万隆会议的阴谋的一部分。关于这点，“基督教科学箴言报”说得很清楚，它说美国在会议达到高潮时提出新的援外计划，“很难说完全是碰巧的或者是无意的。”除了这一切卑鄙的破坏活动以外，当然谁也不会忘记美国勾结蒋匪特务炸毁我国代表团人员座机、企图谋害以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团人员这一血腥罪行。
    尽管美国使用了这许多卑鄙的破坏手段，但是亚非会议还是获得了巨大的成功。这是亚非人民的第一次没有西方殖民国家参加的会议，亚非人民是不能容许它失败的。美国宣传机器企图贬低会议的意义，是完全徒劳的。美国破坏阴谋的失败就是会议的成功，会议的成功就是爱好和平的国家的胜利。这个简单的道理，是十分明显的。
    分析起来，会议成功的因素，首先要归之于亚洲和非洲人民要求和平、要求民族独立平等的不可抑制的愿望。这是推动会议走向正确方向、排除一切困难、克服帝国主义阻挠的根本因素。其次，大多数出席会议的代表团能够反映人民的这些愿望，能够体会会议的伟大历史意义，能够为实现亚非人民的广大团结而努力，也是使会议能够达成一致的协议的必要条件。再其次，南亚各国总理的倡议精神，尤其作为东道主的印度尼西亚总理和使会议能够顺利进行的印度总理的努力，也是会议成功的重要因素。最后，谁也无法否认以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团对会议的重大贡献。中国代表团本着中国政府一贯维护世界和平、促进国际合作的外交政策，在万隆一面坚持立场，一面本着坚持求同存异的精神，倾听不同意见，用说理的态度来争取最大团结。这无疑地给了与会各国的代表以深刻的印象，并将会对今后的国际会议提供良好的榜样。
    第一届亚非会议的结束仅仅是一个开端。在这良好的开端之后，亚非人民间的了解必定会日益加深，团结必定会日益巩固和扩大，这就会大大加强世界和平的力量，而使帝国主义发动战争的阴谋难以得逞。
    不过，帝国主义决不会坐视和平事业的发展，也不会看着亚非会议的影响扩大。因此，中国人民必须时时提高警惕，同亚非各国人民一道，为贯彻亚非会议的各项决议而努力。
