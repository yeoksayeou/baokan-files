The Increasing Atmosphere of Criticism and Self-Criticism
——A Record of the Improvement of the Work of the No. 3 Pit Branch of the Jiaohe Coal Mine
　　Zhang Xisheng

　　There was a rather chaotic period in the No. 3 Pit of the Jiaohe Coal Mine. The branch believed that the factory director was in charge of production management, the trade union was in charge of labor competitions, and they only needed to take care of "education." Thus, the branch abandoned its main responsibilities and neither supervised nor guaranteed production in the pit. The factory director, on the other hand, believed that the branch secretary and other branch committee members did not understand production, and it was easier to solve problems himself than to discuss them with them. Therefore, many major issues in production were not brought up for discussion at the branch committee meetings. The factory director not only did not value the supervisory and guaranteeing role of the Party organization but also neglected the coordinating role of other organizations such as the trade union and the Communist Youth League. As a result, the entire work of the Party, administration, trade union, and the Communist Youth League in the pit was not focused on production with concerted efforts. Often, they were either unrelated to each other or mutually hindering, which naturally caused dissatisfaction and even resentment among themselves. The members of the branch committee also felt that this abnormal situation should be changed, but they did not put their opinions on the table. They preferred to seek peaceful coexistence in "mutual resentment" rather than seeking proper solutions through criticism and self-criticism. Why? Because everyone had a wrong view of criticism and self-criticism within the Party. They believed that if criticism was not accepted by others, it would hurt feelings, affect unity, and hinder work. In fact, it was precisely this vulgar idea of "harmony at all costs" that hindered the development of criticism and self-criticism within the Party and even among the masses of workers, and also hindered the role of mass supervision by all Communist Party members and workers over the leadership. As a result, the workers' production enthusiasm was not high, labor discipline was lax, and the pit failed to meet its production plan every month.

　　This was the situation before June 1954. At that time, the Jiaohe Mining Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a work team to the No. 3 Pit to help rectify the work of the branch. Later, the situation in the No. 3 Pit gradually changed.

　　The main key to the transformation of the No. 3 Pit branch work was the development of criticism and self-criticism. At that time, the work team helped the branch organize all cadres to study the documents related to strengthening the Party's leadership over enterprises, in the spirit of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party. This made the cadres clear that doing a good job in production and completing the national plan were the common tasks of the Party organization, administration, trade union, and the Communist Youth League. This reversed the past decentralism of not focusing on production and acting independently, as well as the arrogance and complacency of not relying on the Party organization and the masses of workers to manage the enterprise. At the review meeting, the pit manager reviewed his bourgeois individualism, and the branch secretary reviewed his mistake of abandoning ideological and political leadership. At another branch committee meeting focusing on implementing collective leadership, the phenomenon of each doing their own thing was further criticized, so that everyone had a relatively deep understanding of the importance of collective leadership. In this way, the collective leadership system could be adhered to, and many major issues could be brought up for discussion at the branch committee or the Party member congress. In the discussion, criticism and self-criticism could be carried out very seriously. For example, when compiling this year's production plan, the administrative cadres only saw the unfavorable conditions of the coal seam being thicker last year and thinner this year, and did not see other favorable conditions. Therefore, they emphasized the difficulties of increasing the coal production task by 41,000 tons and lacked confidence. The Party branch seized this major issue related to this year's production and launched a discussion at the branch committee and the Party member congress, pointing out the favorable conditions of the No. 3 Pit this year, such as the concentration of working faces, which facilitated management, the increase in the degree of mechanization, and the convenience of transportation. It criticized the conservative thinking of one-sidedly emphasizing difficulties, corrected the incorrect views of some cadres, and smoothly achieved the indicators required by the mine in the compilation of the production plan. Another example is that in November 1954, because the pit's roof supports were not built to standard, resulting in a cave-in, a serious injury and death accident occurred. The pit manager, due to bureaucracy, did not fully understand these circumstances. Therefore, the Party branch convened a Party member congress to discuss the incident. At the meeting, the pit manager's review of the incident still lacked self-criticism and only said that the accident was caused by the non-standard roof supports. Coal miner Zhang Taixiang immediately criticized: If the roof supports are not built well, what are you cadres doing? Why is there an acceptance inspection? Transportation squad leader Yang Youshan then criticized: The pit manager should not be so high above and should go deep into the pit to understand the situation and solve problems at any time, otherwise more serious problems will occur! This Party member congress was another good education for the pit manager. From then on, the pit manager could often be encountered in the pit, which greatly strengthened the connection between the pit manager and the masses of workers. The workers also took the initiative to report any situation and opinions to the pit manager.

　　The development and adherence of criticism and self-criticism in the No. 3 Pit is also due to the fact that the branch adopted a firm attitude of support and protection towards criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism: After Party member Yang Youshan criticized the pit manager's bureaucratic leadership style at the Party member congress, the branch committee immediately praised him for his spirit of daring to criticize and called on all Party members to learn from his spirit. After the meeting, Party member Zhou Huacheng said: In the past, subordinates did not dare to express their opinions to superiors at all. On the one hand, they were afraid of retaliation from leading comrades, and on the other hand, they were afraid that others would also criticize themselves, making everyone uncomfortable. Through these Party member congresses and the leadership's support for criticism, we have realized that for the benefit of the Party and the people, and in order to overcome shortcomings in a timely manner, we must have criticism and self-criticism.

　　The Party branch not only often attaches importance to the development of criticism and self-criticism, but also pays close attention to supervising and inspecting the effects of criticism. All criticisms and suggestions made by Party members and the masses are assigned by the branch to relevant departments for inspection and handling. For example, the large ventilator at the entrance of the No. 3 Pit did not have iron bars in the past. If bad people were to sabotage it, the ventilation in the pit would be affected. Party members and the masses had raised opinions several times in the past, but the iron bars were still not installed. Later, Li Yumin, the winch driver of the electromechanical team, criticized it again at the Party member congress. The branch committee immediately told the pit manager to be responsible for handling it. A few days later, the iron bars were installed.

　　The branch not only pays close attention to inspecting and supervising the effects of criticism, but also pays close attention to the emotions and reactions of those who are criticized, helping them to recognize and correct their mistakes and maintain a positive and enthusiastic attitude towards work. For example, Zhao Shunji, a Communist Party member and head of the electromechanical team, had a relatively weak sense of organization in the past. At a Party member congress, everyone made strict criticisms of him. Although he accepted it on the surface at the time, he always felt heavy in his heart and even suspected that everyone was deliberately attacking him. The Party branch promptly learned of this situation and instructed the branch discipline inspection committee member to have a cordial individual talk with him, helping him to recognize his mistakes and dispel his doubts about everyone's motives for criticism. This made him feel the Party's true concern for him, his emotions stabilized, and his production became more active.

　　Criticism and self-criticism also helped the leading cadres of the branch to overcome unhealthy emotions in a timely manner. In January of this year, after the production of the No. 3 Pit had a relatively obvious improvement, some leading cadres of the Party branch of the No. 3 Pit developed a blindly optimistic mood of "the foundation is good." At this time, the Jiaohe Mining Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened the Party branch committee members of the No. 3 Pit for review and criticized the budding complacency. This meeting was a profound education for the branch committee of the No. 3 Pit. The branch secretary said: The timely help of the higher-level Party organization has enabled us to maintain a clear head. In the future, we must be a hundred times more vigilant to ensure the normal leadership of the branch committee.

　　The development of criticism and self-criticism within the Party has also greatly promoted the democratic life among the entire pit's workers. In the three pit-wide production meetings convened by the trade union in the past three months, the workers have been able to frankly express their opinions and criticisms. A total of 52 criticisms and suggestions were made at the three meetings, of which nearly one-fifth were criticisms of the cadres' work style. More frequent criticism and self-criticism are carried out in the daily appraisal meetings. The content of the appraisal includes production situation, work attitude and learning, etc. The process of appraisal is also the process of criticism and self-criticism. At the appraisal meeting, the workers who were praised further improved their production enthusiasm, and the workers who were criticized earnestly corrected their shortcomings. Bai Tingshu, the head of the tunneling team, said: Every time we hold a meeting, every time we receive criticism, it is like adding a lot of capital. Only by making more criticisms can we make fewer mistakes.

　　With the strengthening of democratic life within the Party and among the masses, the connection between the Party branch and the masses has become closer, and the masses' trust in the Party branch has also increased significantly. Every time it is time to go to and from work, there are often people coming in and out of the branch office, including workers, cadres, Party members, and the masses. They come here to report the situation to the branch, some to talk to the branch about problems, and people are happy to tell the branch everything they know, and they are also happy to get instructions and help from the branch. On March 29, Zhang Weixin, an alternate Party member and coal cutting machine operator, did not play an exemplary role in production and his efficiency was very low, and he was unwilling to accept criticisms from others. This situation was quickly reflected to the branch. This enables the branch to grasp the situation in a timely manner, so that the problems that occur in the pit can be noticed and dealt with in a timely manner.

　　So, people will ask, what is the production situation of the No. 3 Pit, which failed to complete its production tasks month after month before June 1954, after carrying out criticism and self-criticism? Let's see: The annual coal production plan for 1954 was completed 40 days ahead of schedule, and the coal mining plan was completed 50 days ahead of schedule. The output of raw coal exceeded the plan by 16%, tunneling exceeded the plan by 22%, and costs were reduced by more than 90,000 yuan.

　　批评和自我批评的风气日渐增长
　　——记蛟河煤矿三坑支部工作改进的情况
　　张希圣
    蛟河煤矿三坑的情况曾经有过一个相当混乱的时期。支部认为生产管理有厂长，劳动竞赛有工会，自己只要管管“教育”就够了，这样，支部就放弃了自己的主要职责，对坑里的生产既不监督，也不保证。厂长则认为支部书记和其他支部委员不懂生产，同他们商量还不如自己解决痛快，因此生产中的许多重大问题也不提到支部委员会上讨论。厂长不仅没有重视党组织的监督保证作用，也忽视其他组织如工会和青年团的配合作用。因此，坑里整个党、政、工、团的工作不是同心协力围绕着生产进行，往往不是各不相关，就是互相牵扯，这自然引起相互间的不满甚至埋怨。支部委员会的委员们也感到这种不正常的情况应该改变，但是他们并没有把自己的意见摆到桌面上来，他们宁愿在“相互埋怨”中求得和平共居，也不愿意运用批评和自我批评求得正当解决。为什么呢？因为大家对待党内的批评和自我批评有一种错误的看法，他们认为提出批评要是别人不能接受，就会伤害感情，就要影响团结，也就会妨碍工作。实际上正是这种“一团和气”的庸俗想法，妨碍了党内以至职工群众中间批评和自我批评的开展，也妨碍了全体共产党员和职工群众对领导上的群众性监督作用的发挥。结果是职工的生产情绪不高，劳动纪律松懈，坑里月月完不成生产计划。
    这是一九五四年六月以前的情况。当时，中共蛟河矿务委员会即派工作组到三坑帮助整顿支部工作。以后，三坑的情况逐渐有了转变。
    三坑支部工作的转变的主要关键，就是开展了批评和自我批评。当时，工作组帮助支部组织全体干部以党的七届四中全会决议的精神，学习了有关加强党对企业领导的文件。这就使干部明确了搞好生产、完成国家计划是党组织和行政、工会、青年团的共同任务，从而扭转了过去不以生产为中心，各自为政的分散主义，和不依靠党组织和职工群众管理企业的骄傲自满情绪。在检查会上，坑长检查了资产阶级个人主义思想，支部书记检查了放弃思想政治领导的错误。在另一次以贯彻集体领导为主要内容的支部委员会上，又进一步地批判了各搞各的分散主义现象，使大家对集体领导的重要性有了比较深刻的认识。这样，集体领导制度能够坚持下来了，许多重大问题都能够提到支部委员会或党员大会上去讨论，讨论中也能够很认真地进行批评和自我批评。如在编制今年生产计划时，行政干部只看到去年煤层厚今年煤层薄这一不利条件，而没有看到其他有利条件，因而对增加四万一千吨产煤任务就强调困难，信心不足。党支部抓住这一有关今年生产的重大问题，就在支部委员会和党员大会上展开讨论，指出三坑今年掌子集中便于管理，机械化程度增加，运输条件便利等有利条件，批判了片面强调困难的保守思想，纠正了某些干部不正确的看法，使生产计划的编制顺利地达到了矿里要求的指标。再如一九五四年十一月，因为坑里顶子打得不合规格，里出外进，结果发生了一次重伤和死亡事故。而坑长由于官僚主义，对这些情况并不十分了解，于是，党支部就召开党员大会针对这一事件进行讨论。会上，坑长对这次事件的检讨，仍然缺乏自我批评精神，只说这些事故是由于顶子不合规格造成的。采煤工人张泰祥当即提出批评：顶子打的不好，你们当干部的管什么？为什么要验收？运输班长杨有山接着又批评道：坑长不应该再高高在上，应该深入到坑下去，随时了解情况，随时解决问题，否则还会发生更严重的问题！这次党员大会对坑长又是一次很好的教育。从此以后，在坑下可以经常碰到坑长了，这就大大密切了坑长和职工群众的联系，职工们有什么情况和意见也就主动地向坑长反映了。
    三坑的批评和自我批评的开展和坚持，还由于支部对待批评和自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评采取了坚决支持和保护的态度：当党员杨有山在党员大会上批评了坑长官僚主义的领导作风以后，支部委员会立即对他这种勇于批评的精神加以表扬，并号召全体党员学习他这种精神。会后，党员周化成说：过去下级对上级有意见根本不敢提，一方面是怕领导同志报复，另一方面是怕别人也来批评自己，弄得大家都不舒服。通过这几次党员大会和领导上对批评的支持，使我们认识到为了党和人民的利益，为了及时克服缺点，必须要有批评和自我批评。
    党支部不仅经常重视批评和自我批评的开展，同时十分注意监督和检查批评的效果。党员和群众所提的一切批评和建议，支部都要分别责成有关部门进行检查处理。比如三坑坑口的大风扇过去没有铁窗，如果要有坏人破坏，坑下的通风就要受到影响。党员和群众过去曾经提过好几次意见，仍未安装铁窗，后来机电班绞车司机李育民在党员大会上又提出批评，支部委员会当即告诉坑长，要他负责处理，几天以后，铁窗子就安上了。
    支部不仅十分注意检查和监督批评的效果，还十分注意被批评者的情绪和反映，帮助被批评者认识和改正自己的错误，保持积极工作的饱满情绪。比如共产党员、机电班长赵顺吉过去组织观念比较薄弱，在一次党员大会上，大家对他提出了严格的批评。他当时表面上虽然接受了，但内心里总感到沉重，甚至怀疑大家对他是不是有意攻击。党支部及时了解到这一情况，并责成支部纪律检查委员和他作亲切的个别谈话，帮助他认识自己的错误，消除他对大家批评动机的怀疑。使他感到党对自己的真正关怀，情绪安定了，生产也积极起来。
    批评和自我批评也帮助支部领导干部及时克服了不健康的情绪。今年一月，当三坑的生产有了比较明显的改进之后，三坑党支部的某些领导干部曾产生了“基础好啦”的盲目乐观情绪。这时，中共蛟河矿务局委员会就召集三坑党支部委员们进行检查，对正在萌芽的自满情绪作了批判。这次会议对三坑支部委员会的教育是深刻的。支部书记说：上级党组织的及时帮助，使我们保持了清醒的头脑，今后必须百倍警惕，保证支部委员会的正常领导。
    党内批评和自我批评的发展，也大大推进了全坑职工中间的民主生活。最近三个月，在工会召开的三次全坑性的生产会议上，职工们都能坦率地提出自己的意见和批评，三次会议共提出批评和建议五十二件，其中批评干部作风的就将近五分之一。更经常的批评和自我批评，是在每日评比会中进行的。评比的内容包括生产情形、劳动态度和学习等等，评比的过程也就是批评和自我批评的过程。在评比会上，受到表扬的工人，更加提高了生产积极性，受到批评的工人，认真地改正自己的缺点。掘进班长白廷树说：每开一次会，每受一次批评，就像增加了不少本钱，只有多作批评，才能少犯错误。
    随着党内和群众中民主生活的加强，党支部同群众的联系日趋密切，群众对党支部的信任也显著增加。每到上下班的时候，支部办公室里经常有进进出出的人，其中有工人、有干部，有党员、也有群众。他们来到这里，有的是向支部汇报情况，有的是找支部谈问题，人们乐于把自己了解的一切告诉支部，也乐于从支部那里得到指示和帮助。三月二十九日那天，候补党员、截煤机手张维信生产中不起模范作用，效率很低，别人对他提出批评，他还不愿接受。这一情况很快就被反映到支部去了。这就使得支部能够及时掌握情况，使得坑里发生的问题能够及时得到注意和处理。
    那么，人们要问，一九五四年六月以前月月完不成生产任务的三坑，在开展批评和自我批评以后的生产情况怎么样呢？请看吧：一九五四年全年的产煤量计划提前四十天完成了，采煤计划提前五十天完成了。原煤产量超过计划百分之十六，掘进超过计划百分之二十二，成本降低了九万多元。
