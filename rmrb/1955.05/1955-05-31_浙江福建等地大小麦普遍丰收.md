Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 30th: Zhejiang Province has achieved a bumper harvest of barley and wheat this year. The total output of barley and wheat will increase by more than 20% compared to last year. In the Wenzhou area, due to favorable rainfall, the total harvest of barley and wheat is expected to increase by approximately 84 million jin compared to last year. Farmers say this is the best harvest in over 30 years. The yield of barley and wheat per mu in the Jinhua area has also increased by 10% to 15% compared to last year, and in some cases even 20%. The wheat growth in the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou plains is very good, and a bumper harvest is also expected. It is estimated that the average yield of barley and wheat per mu in the province can be increased by about 12 jin compared to last year.
	Among the bumper harvests of barley and wheat, the yields of state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives are the most outstanding. The barley yield of the Qingtian County Farm is 307 jin per mu, and the wheat yield is 275 jin per mu, with the best reaching 360 jin. The Hongxing, Xianjin, and other four agricultural production cooperatives in Yongjia County only harvested 80 to 100 jin of wheat per mu last year, but this year they harvested 140 to 180 jin per mu. The newly established Shixi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qingtian County harvested an average of 200 jin of wheat per mu, which is 80 jin higher than the yield of local mutual aid teams and 100 jin higher than that of individual farmers.
	At present, the barley harvest in Wenzhou, Jinhua, Ningbo and other areas has basically been completed, and the wheat harvest is in full swing. The wheat harvest in the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas will be generally completed in early June.
	According to Xinhua News Agency: By mid-May, spring-ripening crops such as wheat, barley, and broad beans in Fujian Province have been mostly harvested, and the yields have increased compared to last year. The total wheat output in the province increased by 7% compared to last year, barley increased by 3%, and broad beans increased by 16.8%. The yield per mu of barley and wheat in Jianyang, Nanping, Yong'an, Fuan and other areas has also generally increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year. In some agricultural production cooperatives in Pingtan, Minhou, Changle and other counties, the highest wheat yield reached 500 jin per mu.
	The increase in spring-ripening crops in Fujian Province this year is the result of farmers actively utilizing winter fallow fields to expand planting areas and overcome natural disasters. The harvested area of wheat, barley, and broad beans in the province has increased by 42% compared to last year. Wheat alone has yielded more than 20 million jin due to the expansion of planting area.
	According to Xinhua News Agency: The wheat harvest in Sichuan Province is nearing completion, and many areas have increased production compared to last year. The total wheat output in the Luzhou and Neijiang areas has increased by approximately 10% to 15% compared to last year. The yield per mu of wheat on the Chengdu Plain has also generally increased compared to last year.
	After harvesting, farmers have been drying and cleaning the wheat and selling it to the state. State grain purchasing departments have set up many fixed purchasing points and mobile purchasing teams to facilitate farmers' sales, and have also implemented a premium price for high-quality grain.

　　浙江福建等地大小麦普遍丰收
    新华社杭州三十日电　今年浙江省大、小麦普遍丰收。大、小麦总产量将比去年增产二成以上。温州专区由于雨水调和，今年大、小麦总收获量可比去年增产约八千四百多万斤，农民说这是三十多年来没有过的大丰收。金华专区大、小麦每亩产量也比去年增产一成到一成半，有的还可以增产二成。杭（州）、嘉（兴）、湖（州）平原地区的小麦生长很好，预计也可以丰收。估计全省大、小麦单位面积产量平均每亩可比去年提高十二斤左右。
    在大、小麦丰收中，各地国营农场和农业生产合作社的产量最突出。青田县农场的大麦每亩收三百零七斤，小麦每亩收二百七十五斤，最好的要收三百六十斤。永嘉县红星、先进等四个农业生产合作社，去年每亩小麦只收八十斤到一百斤，今年每亩收到一百四十斤到一百八十斤。青田县新建的石溪农业生产合作社平均每亩小麦收二百斤，比当地互助组的产量高出八十斤，比单干农民产量高出一百斤。
    现在温州、金华、宁波等专区大麦已基本收割完毕，正在紧张收割小麦。杭（州）、嘉（兴）、湖（州）地区的小麦将在六月上旬普遍收割。
    据新华社讯　到五月中旬，福建省小麦、大麦、蚕豆等春熟作物已大部收完，产量都比去年增加。全省小麦总产量比去年增产百分之七，大麦增产百分之三，蚕豆增产百分之十六点八。建阳、南平、永安、福安等专区大麦、小麦的单位面积产量，也大都比去年增加一成到两成。平潭、闽侯、长乐等县有些农业生产合作社的小麦，最高产量每亩达五百斤。
    今年福建省春熟作物的增产，是农民积极利用冬闲田扩大种植面积和战胜自然灾害的结果。全省小麦、大麦和蚕豆的收获面积，比去年扩大了百分之四十二。仅小麦一项，因面积扩大而多收的就有两千多万斤。
    据新华社讯　四川省麦收快要结束，许多地区都比去年增产。泸州、内江两专区小麦总产量比去年增加约百分之十到十五左右。成都平原上小麦单位面积产量一般也比去年提高。
    农民在收割后，纷纷把小麦晒干、扬净，卖给国家。国家粮食收购部门为便利农民出售，设立了许多固定收购点和流动收购小组，在价格上也做到优级优价。
