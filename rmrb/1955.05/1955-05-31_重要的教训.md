Important Lessons
Li Bozhao

After reading the second batch of materials concerning the activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily," it is proven that Hu Feng and the core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group were spies who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, the most vicious, cunning, and stubborn enemies. What lessons should we learn from this incident?

Hu Feng has always verbally claimed how he supported the Communist Party, as if he would not even have a place to settle down without the Communist Party. But in reality, how did he view the Communist Party in his head, which was filled with filth? The Chinese Communist Party is the party that led the Chinese revolution to victory, and it is the banner of the Chinese people's happiness, but this spy Hu Feng dared to slander the Central Committee of the Communist Party as a "board of directors." What is a "board of directors"? It is a group of profit-seeking businessmen! The despicable political swindler Hu Feng has become so insane to such a vulgar extent.

Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is a classic work of Marxism-Leninism on literature and art, a brilliant development of creative Marxist doctrine in the field of literature and art, the direction of our literature and art, and the specific guidance of the Party's principles in literature and art, but it was viciously slandered by the spy Hu Feng as: "a booklet treated as a 'totem'." What is a "totem"? It means that in a primitive and backward tribe, an idol is found to worship, maybe a cow, a horse, or just something that is taken as an idol by the backward tribe. This is such a vicious and intolerable slander!

This shameless political swindler, Hu Feng, will "play dead" if you hit him, making it impossible to find an "opponent." This spy Hu Feng habitually uses counter-revolutionary double-dealing tactics: he opposes Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," but he teaches members of his group: "Don't touch it, and where possible, follow it, as I did in 'Lu'." On the one hand, he "grasps one or two centers" and supports the "Talks," but on the other hand, he wants his followers to conduct a "digging-out-the-heart war" in theory to fundamentally undermine the Party's literary and artistic policies. The Hu Feng group not only has its program and tactics, but also its organizational principles of the counter-revolutionary group. When he frantically attacks the Party, he wants his followers to "observe organizational principles" to "ensure the victory of the struggle." Hu Feng even ordered members of his group to "try the tactic of Sun Wukong (Monkey King) entering the belly," sneaking into local newspapers and magazines to establish positions and publish their reactionary articles. As long as they could be published, "the remuneration is not counted, it is okay even if it is not needed." In order to probe secrets, he asked Ji Fang to steal the "internal communications" of the "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette), and frequently steal Party documents and probe situations from Lu Dian, Xu Fang, and others who had infiltrated the Party. He even ordered his followers to open up strongholds everywhere, and he regarded Peng Boshan's appointment as Deputy Minister of Culture of the former East China Military and Political Committee as a great "hope" for "opening up positions." When the anti-Party conspiracy of the Hu Feng group was exposed and the reactionary bourgeois idealism was revealed, this spy Hu Feng wanted his followers to retreat and prepare for a comeback. As he wrote to Jia Zhifang, Feng Yi, and others, asking them to "treat what has happened and what will happen with an extremely calm and composed attitude." He asked them "not to write letters or articles or express immature opinions." He wanted his followers to prepare in advance, "first examine their own erroneous articles," and "then criticize Hu (Hu Feng)," attempting to deceive the Party and the people with false self-criticism. He told them not to be sad, to endure, Hu Feng said: "Only in endurance can we seek rebirth, everything is for the cause, for a more distant future." What is the future of the Hu Feng group members, except to expect the restoration of counter-revolution, there will be no other "future."

We must continue to expose Hu Feng's double-dealing conspiracy.

Judging from the second batch of materials on the Hu Feng reactionary group, the Hu Feng reactionary group became even more unscrupulous and organized in expanding its counter-revolutionary conspiracy activities after the national liberation, even infiltrating the heart of the Communist Party, using Sun Wukong's digging-out-the-heart tactic, planning to install moles within the Party, stealing documents, probing information, and spreading its followers throughout the country to establish counter-revolutionary strongholds. The Shanghai New Literature and Art Publishing House is one of the largest strongholds of its reactionary conspiracy activities. It proves that the Hu Feng reactionary group is an organized, led, and disciplined counter-revolutionary organization. This counter-revolutionary organization is disguised as revolutionary in action, hiding in the Party and in the revolutionary ranks to destroy the Party and the revolution, attempting to overthrow the people's revolutionary regime, so as to achieve the purpose of counter-revolutionary restoration. Isn't this clear enough? He only chose our literary and art front to start with. This is a true fact before us. We must not catch a cold in the nose again, raise our political vigilance, and strictly guard against its double-dealing deceptive behavior. Here, I quote a passage from Chapter Ten of the "Short Course of the History of the CPSU (Bolsheviks)," which is of great practical guiding significance for our struggle against the Hu Feng group: "Political double-dealers usually start with deception, using the means of deceiving the people, deceiving the working class, and deceiving the party of the working class to do their dark deeds. However, political double-dealers must not be regarded as just a few liars. Political double-dealers are a bunch of unscrupulous political careerists who have long lost the trust of the people, so they adopt the method of deception, the method of chameleon-like changes, the method of abduction – using whatever method they can – to try to regain trust, just to maintain their qualifications as political activists. Political double-dealers are a bunch of unprincipled political careerists who are willing to rely on anyone, even bandits, even social scum, even the deadly enemies of the people, in order to climb back onto the political stage at a 'suitable time' and ride on the necks of the people as the 'rulers' of the people."

Hu Feng and the core members of his group are the specimens of such political double-dealers. We must suppress such vicious enemies, spies in the revolutionary ranks!

We must suppress spies! Strictly guard against spies! Eliminate double-dealing political swindlers. We must get to the bottom of who is the master of the Hu Feng group? We have already won a victory in this serious struggle, and we must strive for a complete victory. We can and will definitely do it.

Our important lesson is: strengthen unity, strengthen the study of dialectical materialism, and raise political vigilance to cure the bad habit of a cold in the nose and a lack of sense of smell among us!

　　重要的教训
　　李伯钊
    读了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命阴谋集团活动的第二批材料之后，证明胡风和胡风反革命集团的骨干分子，是打入革命队伍中来的奸细分子，是最凶恶，最狡猾，最顽强的敌人。我们对于这件事应该得到什么教训呢？
    胡风历来口口声声说他是如何拥护共产党，好像没有共产党，他个人就连安身立命之地都不会有了。可是实际上，在他那塞满污秽的思想的脑袋里是怎么来看共产党的？中国共产党是领导中国革命取得胜利的政党，他是中国人民幸福的旗帜，而胡风这奸细竟敢污蔑共产党中央委员会是“董事会”。什么是“董事会”？是资本家唯利是图的商人集团吧！可恶的政治骗子胡风丧心病狂到如此下流的程度。
    毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，是马克思列宁主义关于文艺方面的经典著作，创造性的马克思主义学说在文艺领域辉煌的发展，是我们文学艺术的方向，文学艺术党性原则的具体指导，却被胡风这奸细恶毒的污蔑为：“被当作了‘图腾’的小册子”。什么是“图腾”？就是说这是在一个原始落后的部落里，找一种偶像来崇拜，也许是一头牛，一匹马，或者随便是一种什么东西，被落后部落的人拿来当着偶像崇拜而已。这又是多么恶毒令人不能容忍的中伤与污蔑！
    胡风这个无耻的政治骗子，你打他，他会“装死躺下”，使你找不到“对手”。胡风这奸细惯用反革命的两面派手法：他反对毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，但是他教他集团中的分子：“不要去碰它，可能的地方还要顺着它，如我在‘路’所做的”。他一面“抓一两个中心”，拥护“讲话”，一面却要其党徒们从理论上去做“挖心战”，从根子上破坏党的文艺政策。胡风集团不仅有他的纲领、策略，还有他的反革命集团的组织原则。当他疯狂向党进攻的时候，他要他的党羽“遵守组织原则”，以“保证斗争”胜利。胡风更令其集团分子“试用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，钻到各地报刊杂志中去建立阵地，去刊登他们的反动文章。只要能刊出，“报酬不计，不要都可以”。为了刺探机密，他要冀汸偷“文艺报”的“内部通讯”，并经常从打进党来的芦甸、徐放等窃取党内文件，刺探情况。他更令其党羽到处开辟据点，他以彭柏山担任前华东军政委员会文化部副部长为“开辟岗位”的莫大“希望”。当胡风集团的反党阴谋被揭穿，反动资产阶级的唯心论被揭露，胡风这奸细又要他的党徒们实行退却，准备卷土重来。如他给贾植芳、冯异等去信，要他们“用极冷静极沉着的态度对待已经发生的和将要发生的事情”。要他们“不要写信写文章或者发表不成熟的意见”。要他的党羽们事先准备，“先检查自己的错误文章”，“再批评一下胡某（胡风）”，企图以假检讨来欺骗党，欺骗人民。要他们不要痛苦，要忍受，胡风说：“只有在忍受中求得重生，一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来。”什么是胡风集团分子的未来，除了企待反革命的复辟不会有什么别的“未来”。
    我们要继续揭露胡风两面派的阴谋。
    从关于胡风反动集团第二批材料看来，胡风反动集团在全国解放之后，更肆无忌惮，更有组织地扩展他的反革命的阴谋活动，一直打入共产党的心脏，使用孙行者的挖心战术，有计划在党内安插坐探，偷窃文件，探听情报，并在全国各地散布党羽，建立反革命的据点。上海新文艺出版社就是其反动阴谋活动的最大据点之一。证明胡风反动集团是有组织、有领导、有纪律的反革命组织。这个反革命的组织是在行动上伪装革命，暗藏在党、在革命阵容中以破坏党、破坏革命，企图推翻人民革命政权，以达反革命复辟为目的的。这难道还不明白吗？他只不过选择了我们文艺战线着手。这是千真万确的事实摆在我们面前。我们鼻子再也不能伤风了，提高政治警惕，严防其两面派的欺骗行为。这里，我引用“联共（布）党史简明教程”第十章有一段话，对我们同胡风集团作斗争，极有现实的指导意义：“政治上的两面派通常总是从欺骗开始做起，用欺骗人民，欺骗工人阶级，欺骗工人阶级党的手段来干自己的黑暗勾当。然而，决不可把政治上的两面派看作单只是一些骗子。政治上的两面派乃是一伙毫无宗旨的政治野心家，他们早已丧失了人民方面的信任，于是就采用欺骗的方法，采用蜥蜴变色的方法，采用拐骗的方法——随便采用什么方法都可以——来企图重新博得信任，只求为自己保持着政治活动家的资格。政治上的两面派乃是一伙毫无原则的政治野心家，他们甘愿倚靠随便什么人，甚至倚靠盗匪分子，甚至倚靠社会败类，甚至倚靠人民死敌，以便在‘适当时机’来重新爬上政治舞台，来骑在人民颈上充当人民的‘统治者’。”
    胡风及其集团的骨干分子，正是这种政治上两面派的标本。我们对于如此凶恶的敌人，革命阵营中的奸细非镇压不可！
    我们必须镇压奸细！严防奸细！清除两面派的政治骗子。我们必须追根究底，胡风集团的主子是谁？这场严重的斗争，我们已经取得了胜利，我们要争取全胜。也一定能办到。
    我们重要的教训是：加强团结，加强辩证唯物主义的学习，提高政治警惕，来治愈我们当中的鼻子伤风、嗅觉不灵的坏毛病！
