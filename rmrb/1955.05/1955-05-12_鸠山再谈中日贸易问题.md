Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 10th: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama stated on the 9th, in response to inquiries regarding Sino-Japanese trade issues at a meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, that he would allow the establishment of Chinese commercial representative offices in Japan.

Hatoyama said, "In order to expand trade, we cannot disallow the establishment of a private Chinese trade representative office here. I once assured members of the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade that I would cooperate on this matter. The members of the League originally requested the establishment of a non-official Chinese representative office, and to guarantee the safety of life and property of the representative office personnel, and to guarantee their freedom of residence, work, and communication. To this request, I replied that I would cooperate."

　　鸠山再谈中日贸易问题
    新华社十日讯　东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎九日在众议院预算委员会会议上答复有关中日贸易问题的质询时表示，他允许在日本设立中国的商务代表机构。
    鸠山说：“为了扩大贸易，我们不能不允许在这里设立一个私人的中国贸易代表机构。我曾经向国会议员促进日中贸易联盟的人员保证过：我要在这件事情上给予合作。联盟的人员原来要求设立一个非官方的中国代表机构，并且保障代表机构人员的生命和财产的安全，保障他们的居住、工作和通信的自由。对于这个要求，我答复说：我要给予合作。”
