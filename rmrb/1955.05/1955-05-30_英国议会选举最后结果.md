Xinhua News Agency, London, 29th. News: The final results of the British general election were announced on the 28th.

According to Reuters, the Conservative Party won 345 seats, the Labour Party won 277 seats, the Liberal Party won 6 seats, and the Irish Sinn Fein won 2 seats.

The Conservative Party now has a majority of 60 seats, compared to a majority of 19 seats before the dissolution of the last House of Commons. However, it received more than 377,000 fewer votes than in the last general election.

The Labour Party lost 17 seats and more than 1.5 million votes. In a television broadcast on the 27th, Labour leader Attlee tried his best to attribute the Labour Party's failure to internal divisions. However, according to many newspapers, the reason why the Labour Party had internal divisions and lost votes was actually because the right-wing Labour leaders' policy of supporting the arming of West Germany and expanding armaments went against the wishes of ordinary Labour Party members and the British people.

The political commentator of the "Daily Worker" said that the Conservative Party's victory was the result of the Labour Party, headed by Attlee and Morrison, constantly turning to the right in its policies. The commentator said that about 77 percent of voters participated in this election, while the last election was 82.6 percent. Some voters refused to participate in the voting because they were dissatisfied with the policies of the right-wing Labour Party leaders.

On the 29th, the "Financial Times" editorial commented on the election results: "The stock exchange naturally celebrated the Conservative Party's victory yesterday." The "Daily Mail" also said: "Steel company stockholders made particularly large profits yesterday. American investors have also invested in British companies."

　  英国议会选举最后结果
    新华社二十九日讯　伦敦消息：英国大选的最后结果已经在二十八日公布。
    据路透社消息，保守党获得了三百四十五个议席，工党获得二百七十七席，自由党获得六席，爱尔兰新芬党获得二席。
    保守党现在就拥有六十席的多数，而在上届下院解散前它拥有十九席的多数。但是它获得的选票比上一次大选反而减少了三十七万七千多票。
    工党丧失了十七席和一百五十多万选票。工党领袖艾德礼二十七日在电视广播中竭力把工党的失败归咎于内部的分歧。但是，根据许多报纸的意见，工党之所以发生内部分歧和丧失选票，实际上是因为右翼工党领袖支持武装西德和扩充军备的政策违背工党普通党员和英国人民的愿望。
    “工人日报”的政治评论员说，保守党的胜利是以艾德礼和摩里逊为首的工党在政策上不断向右转的结果。评论员说，这次参加投票的选民为百分之七十七左右，而上次选举是百分之八十二点六。有一部分选民因为不满意右翼工党上层的政策，拒绝参加投票。
    二十九日，“金融时报”的社论评论选举结果说：“股票交易所昨日当然为保守党的胜利而狂欢。”“每日简报”也说：“钢铁公司股票握有者昨日获得特别大的利润。美国投资者也向英国公司投资了。”
