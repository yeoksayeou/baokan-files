　　Ministry of Finance Issues Measures for Handling the Redemption of Damaged and Defaced National Bonds

　　The national bonds issued by the state have, in some cases, been damaged or defaced due to improper storage by bondholders. In order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of bondholders and prevent potential malpractices arising from this, the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China issued the "Measures for Handling the Redemption of Damaged and Defaced National Bonds" on the 18th. The measures stipulate that any bond (excluding coupons) that can be identified as a genuine bond, even if it has been worn, torn, cracked, gnawed by rodents, eaten by insects, burned, scorched, stained with water, soaked in oil, or has other damage or defacement not caused intentionally, will be redeemed according to the face value of the bond if the remaining part is at least one-half of the original bond and the number is complete and intact, or if the remaining part of the damaged or defaced bond, whose number is incomplete or completely lost, exceeds one-half of the original bond. For bonds meeting the above redemption conditions, the attached damaged coupons, if the remaining part is at least one-half, can be redeemed according to the face value, in accordance with the regulations for handling the redemption of principal and interest of public bonds; coupons with less than one-half remaining will not be redeemed. If the winning number can be identified on the aforementioned bonds that meet the redemption conditions, the principal and interest will be redeemed in accordance with the regulations for handling the redemption of principal and interest of public bonds. If the last two digits of the number are missing or there is no number, the due interest may be paid if coupons are attached, but the principal of the bond shall be redeemed only at the final (i.e., last year's) principal redemption. Any damaged or defaced bond that does not meet the above redemption conditions or cannot be identified as a genuine bond, or that has been intentionally altered, patched, or pieced together, causing the bond to be damaged or defaced, will not be redeemed, and the attached coupons will not be redeemed either. All bonds and coupons that are not redeemed shall be collected free of charge by the People's Bank of China, which shall issue a receipt and stamp the tickets with a "cancelled" chop to invalidate them.

　　财政部发布国家公债债券残破污损兑付处理办法
    国家所发行的公债债券，由于持券人保管不慎，有的发生残破污损的情况。为了保护持券人的正常权益和防止可能因此发生的弊端，中华人民共和国财政部在十八日发布了“国家公债债券残破污损兑付处理办法”。这个办法规定：凡能够鉴别确是真券的债券（不包括息票），虽有磨破、折裂、鼠咬、虫蚀、火烧、熏焦、水渍、油浸和其他不是出于故意造成的残破污损现象，其留存部分够原券二分之一并且号码完整无缺的，或残破污损的债券，号码不完全或完全失掉号码，其留存部分超过原券二分之一的，都可以按照债券票面金额兑付；合于上述兑付条件的债券，所附的残破息票，其留存部分够二分之一的，可以依照公债还本付息处理手续的规定，照票面的金额兑付，不够二分之一的不予兑付。前述合于兑付条件的债券，如果能够鉴别中签号码者，即依照公债还本付息处理手续的规定兑付本息，如果因为缺少末尾两位号码或没有号码，除附有息票的，可将到期利息照付外，其债券本金须待末期（就是最后一年）还本的时候兑付；凡不合于上述兑付条件的或残破污损的债券，无法鉴别是否确属真券的，以及因为故意涂改、挖补、拼凑，使债券残破污损的，都不予兑付，其所附的息票亦一律不予兑付。不予兑付的债券和息票，一律由中国人民银行开给收据，无偿收回，并在票面上加盖“作废”戳记，予以作废。　（新华社）
