Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 9th: Vice Premier Ulanhu, head of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China, delivered a speech at the celebration meeting in Prague marking the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia.

　　Ulanhu first extended warm, fraternal congratulations on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China to the government and all the people of the Czechoslovak Republic.

　　Ulanhu said: Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the tested Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak people have crushed the sabotage plots of reactionary forces at home and abroad, consolidated the people's democratic system, and fundamentally changed the economic situation of the country. They have successfully completed their first five-year plan and have achieved brilliant successes in socialist construction and national industrialization. Today, the Czechoslovak Republic has become a strong member of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, and is making great efforts to safeguard peace in Europe and the world.

　　Ulanhu said: The friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Czech peoples in political, economic, and cultural fields is expanding and deepening with the vigorous development of socialist construction in both countries. The Chinese people deeply appreciate the assistance of the Czechoslovak people and government to China's socialist construction, which reflects the mutual care and support between the Czechoslovak and Chinese peoples. The Czechoslovak Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction, which recently opened in Beijing, has provided the Chinese people with the opportunity to observe and learn from the brilliant achievements of the wisdom and creative labor of the Czechoslovak people. This deepening friendship and cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia is not only conducive to promoting the common rise of our two countries' economies and cultures, but also of great significance to strengthening the power of the peace, democracy and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union and safeguarding the common cause of world peace.

　　After pointing out that the American aggressor group and its followers continue to adhere to the policies of war and aggression, creating and deepening international tensions, Ulanhu said: It is absolutely necessary for the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies of Europe to unite their forces and prepare for any possible sudden events in order to safeguard their own security and peace in Europe. The 600 million liberated Chinese people will fully support these measures. We firmly stand with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies to fight for world peace and security. The Czechoslovak people will always receive the full support of the Chinese people in their struggle to defend their own security and European peace, oppose the rearmament of West Germany and the imperialist war plots.

　　Ulanhu concluded by reading out the congratulatory message from the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the State Council.

　　乌兰夫副总理在布拉格庆祝大会上讲话
    新华社布拉格九日电　中华人民共和国政府代表团团长、国务院副总理乌兰夫在布拉格举行的捷克斯洛伐克解放十周年庆祝大会上讲了话。
    乌兰夫首先代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府和全体捷克斯洛伐克人民致热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    乌兰夫说：十年来，捷克斯洛伐克人民在久经考验的捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，粉碎了国内外反动势力的破坏阴谋，巩固了人民民主制度，并使全国的经济状况发生了根本的变化。他们已经胜利完成了第一个五年计划，在社会主义建设和国家工业化方面，已经取得了辉煌的成就。今天捷克斯洛伐克共和国已成为以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的坚强的一员，为维护欧洲和世界的和平作着巨大的努力。
    乌兰夫说：中捷两国人民在政治经济文化各方面的友好合作，随着两国社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展而日益扩大和加深。中国人民深切感谢捷克斯洛伐克人民和政府对中国社会主义建设事业的援助，这种援助表现了捷克斯洛伐克人民和中国人民的相互关怀和支持。不久前捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会在北京开幕，使中国人民有机会来观摩和学习捷克斯洛伐克人民的智慧和创造性劳动的光辉成就。中捷两国间的这种日益加深的友谊和合作，不仅有利于促进我们两国经济和文化的共同高涨，而且对壮大以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的力量和保卫世界和平的共同事业有着重要的意义。
    乌兰夫在指出美国侵略集团和它的追随者继续坚持战争政策和侵略政策，制造和加深国际紧张局势以后说：苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家为维护自身安全和欧洲和平，联合自己的力量，准备应付任何可能的突然事变，这是非常必要的。解放了的六亿中国人民将以全力支持这些措施。我们坚决同苏联和各人民民主国家站在一起，为保障世界和平和安全而斗争。捷克斯洛伐克人民在保卫自身安全和欧洲和平、反对重新武装西德和帝国主义战争阴谋的斗争中，将永远获得中国人民的全力支持。
    乌兰夫最后宣读了中华人民共和国主席、全国人民代表大会常务委员会和国务院的祝词。
