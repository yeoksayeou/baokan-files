Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 13th (TASS): The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party has concluded, during which the question of establishing a united front of the working class in the struggle for peace and the defense of economic demands was discussed.

The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, Maurice Thorez, spoke at the closing session of the plenary meeting. He pointed out that the Communist Party, as before, is the leading party in France, and the working class and the broad masses of all working people have great confidence in it. The recent local elections clearly demonstrated this.

Thorez cited examples to illustrate the working people's desire for united action and pointed out that Communists should do everything possible to combat everything that hinders the broad unity of the people's forces. Only in this way can the unity of the democratic forces of the French nation become an unstoppable reality and be immediately reflected in parliament. The responsibility of every Communist Party member is to strengthen the Party's ties with the proletariat and non-proletarian masses, pay attention to safeguarding the demands of the working class and all working people, and demonstrate a high sense of responsibility in various workers' groups and democratic groups, especially in trade unions.

Thorez then said that it is the duty of every Communist Party member to fight for the realization of the Party's policies, to oppose all opportunist tendencies aimed at undermining the Party on all fronts, to oppose sectarian phenomena, and especially to oppose taking a disdainful attitude towards workers of the Socialist Party. It is the responsibility of every Communist Party member to constantly strengthen all aspects of political, ideological, and organizational work.

Thorez said that whether the united front of the working class can exert a decisive influence on the country's policies in the near future, and whether it can achieve decisive results in the struggle to win the welfare of the working people, safeguard democratic freedoms, defend peace, and restore French national independence, depends on the above-mentioned actions taken by all Party members, and depends on the loyalty and activity of every Party member.

The plenary session adopted a resolution. The resolution emphasized that favorable conditions have been created domestically for expanding the united action of the working class. The resolution said that united action can and must be achieved in the campaign to collect signatures for the "Appeal to the People of the World" prepared by the World Peace Council against atomic warfare, in the preparation for the World Peace Congress, and in the struggle to abide by the resolutions of the Geneva Conference. United action can also be established in the struggle to generally increase wages, oppose layoffs, and abolish the emergency law.

The resolution pointed out that in order to accomplish these tasks, it is necessary to enhance the activity of all Party members and improve the organizational and ideological work in every organization of the Party.

　　法国共产党中央委员会全体会议通过决议
　　号召全体党员扩大法国工人阶级一致行动
    新华社十四日讯　据塔斯社巴黎十三日讯：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议已经结束，这次会议讨论了关于在争取和平和维护经济要求的斗争中建立工人阶级的统一战线的问题。
    党中央委员会总书记多列士在全体会议闭幕会议上讲了话。他指出：共产党像以前一样是法国首要的政党，工人阶级和全体劳动人民群众对它非常信任。最近的地方选举就十分明显地表明了这一点。
    多列士列举了一些事例来说明劳动人民希望一致行动，并且指出：共产党人应该尽一切力量，对阻挠人民力量广泛团结的一切进行斗争。只有这样，法国民族民主力量的团结才会成为不可遏制的现实而马上在议会方面表现出来。每个共产党员的责任就是：加强党同无产阶级以及非无产阶级群众的联系，注意维护工人阶级和全体劳动人民的要求，在各种工人团体和民主团体中，首先是在工会中，表现高度的责任感。
    多列士接着说：每一个共产党员的责任是为实现党的政策而斗争，在各条战线上反对目的在瓦解党的一切机会主义倾向，反对宗派主义的现象，特别是反对对社会党的工人采取轻视的态度。每一个共产党员的责任是：经常加强政治、思想和组织等一切方面的工作。
    多列士说：工人阶级的统一阵线是否能够在最近时期内对国家的政策起决定性的影响，是否能够在争取劳动人民的福利、维护民主自由、保卫和平和恢复法国民族独立的斗争中取得决定性的成果，就有赖于全体党员采取上述行动，有赖于每一个党员的忠诚和积极性。
    全体会议通过了一个决议。决议着重指出：在国内已经为扩大工人阶级的一致行动创造了有利条件。决议说：在为世界和平理事会反对原子战争准备的“告全世界人民书”征集签名的运动中，在筹备世界和平大会的过程中，在争取遵守日内瓦会议决议的斗争中，是可以而且必须实现一致行动的。在争取普遍提高工资、反对解雇、争取废除紧急状态法的斗争中，也可以建立一致行动。
    决议指出：为了完成这些任务，必须提高全体党员的积极性，改进党的每一个组织中的组织工作和思想工作。
