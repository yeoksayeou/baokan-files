　　The Struggle to Safeguard European Peace Must Be Intensified
　　——Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Soviet Army's Victory over Fascist Germany
    Today is the tenth anniversary of the great victory of the Soviet army over fascist Germany. Ten years ago, the Soviet army thoroughly crushed Hitler's rule, the German people were liberated, and the flags of freedom and peace for all nations flew over Europe. The people of the world rejoiced at this great victory and were grateful for the great historical achievements of the Soviet army.
    After Hitler's fascist rule was crushed, the German people made diligent and unremitting efforts to build Germany into a unified, democratic, and peace-loving country in accordance with the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, they carried out various democratic reforms on one-third of their land and established their own German Democratic Republic.
    The German Democratic Republic is a new type of state that has never existed in German history. For five years, its people, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, have been building their new homeland with selfless enthusiasm and creating their peaceful lives. The people of the German Democratic Republic have made great achievements in politics, economy, and culture, and their living standards are improving day by day. In order to strive for the unification of Germany and for European peace and security, the German Democratic Republic is uniting the people of all Germany at the forefront of the struggle, winning the support and trust of the peace-loving people of Germany, and becoming a strong fortress for the German people to strive for unity, peace, democracy, and independence.
    However, the American aggressor group and its followers disregard the wishes of the peace-loving people of Germany and the solemn agreements of the wartime allies. From the very beginning, they have attempted to revive German militarism and turn Germany back into a hotbed for preparing for war. They pursue a shameful policy of strength, implement the division of Germany and the rearmament of West Germany, and drag West Germany into the military aggression group of Western countries. Under the support of the United States, the monopoly capital and militarists of West Germany have regained power and are trying to lead Germany on Hitler's path of preparing to launch another war. The actions of the American aggressor group and its followers are directly aimed at the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries of Europe. They vainly attempt to overthrow the socialist regimes of these countries and the regimes of the working people in order to establish imperialist enslavement rule. Because of this policy of the United States and its followers, not only has Germany been unable to unify and a peace treaty with Germany has been unable to be concluded for ten years, but also ominous war clouds have once again enveloped Europe and the world.
    The peace-loving people of European countries, especially the German people, resolutely oppose the US policy of reviving German militarism. The strength of the peace-loving people of all countries has led to the bankruptcy of the "European Defense Community" plan concocted by the United States. The opposition of the people has also made it impossible for the Paris Agreement to gain majority support in the parliaments of Western European countries, and it was only reluctantly passed under US pressure. The German people oppose re-militarization and demand the restoration of national unity in a peaceful and democratic manner. The strength of the people demanding peace is also constantly growing in West Germany. The recent defeat of the Christian Democratic Union, which promoted the policy of rearming West Germany, in the elections of the Lower Saxony State Parliament clearly shows the strong will of the people to love peace. This will of the European people and the German people to oppose the revival of German militarism is an important force in preventing the US aggressor group and its followers from pursuing a policy of aggressive war in Europe.
    However, the American aggressor group and its followers brazenly violate the will of the people and are determined to implement the Paris Agreement on rearming West Germany. They have already put the Paris Agreement into effect. This will allow the West German militarist forces to openly rebuild their aggressive army, which will also possess atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The most aggressive German militarism is once again embarking on the road of militarism, which cannot but fundamentally change the European situation and greatly increase the danger of a new war. The people of all countries who have suffered the disasters of World War II are once again facing the threat of a new war that is far more cruel than World War II.
    Under such circumstances, the peace-loving countries of Europe, including the German Democratic Republic, have to take all necessary measures. The eight governments that participated in the Conference on Safeguarding European Peace and Security held in Moscow last year have recently agreed to hold a second meeting in Warsaw on May 11 to discuss the issue of the participating countries concluding a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance, and the issue of organizing the joint command of the treaty participating countries. The Government of the People's Republic of China will also send its observers to participate in the meeting. The Warsaw meeting will undoubtedly further strengthen the unity between the peace-loving countries of Europe and strengthen their defense forces to prevent sudden incidents due to the aggressive adventures of imperialist war forces. This is an important action by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving European countries to resolutely defend peace and their own security, and it is also part of the Soviet Union's and the entire socialist camp's firm peace policy. It is entirely in line with the interests of the peace-loving people of the world. The Chinese people resolutely support all the measures taken by the peace-loving countries and people of Europe to safeguard European peace, and will work with them to jointly shoulder the lofty responsibility of safeguarding European and world peace.
    Now, the possibility of resolving the German issue peacefully has not been exhausted. The important agreements reached at the Soviet-Austrian talks, and the four-nation ambassadorial talks on the Austrian peace treaty, have once again pointed out the way to resolve the German issue. Public opinion in all countries, especially German public opinion, believes that if West Germany does not participate in aggressive military groups, refuses to establish military bases in West Germany, and embarks on the road of consultation and peace, Germany can be restored to unity, which will also be conducive to safeguarding the interests of European security. To this end, the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving people in Germany are working to abolish the Paris Agreement and promote a peaceful settlement of the German issue through consultation. This just demand of the German people has won the sympathy and support of the people of Europe and the peace-loving people of the world. We believe that the growing force for peace and the increasingly resolute world peace-loving people who want to control their own destiny will surely be able to shatter the US war plan. The just cause of the German people will surely triumph.

　　必须加紧保障欧洲和平的斗争
　　——纪念苏军战胜法西斯德国胜利日十周年
    今天是苏联军队战胜法西斯德国伟大胜利日的十周年。十年前，苏联军队彻底粉碎了希特勒的统治，德国人民获得了解放，各国人民自由和和平的旗帜在欧洲飘扬起来。全世界人民为这个伟大的胜利而欢欣鼓舞，并且感激苏联军队的伟大历史功绩。
    德国人民在希特勒的法西斯统治被粉碎以后，为了按照波茨坦协定的方针，把德国建成一个统一、民主、爱好和平的国家，作了辛勤不懈的努力。他们在德国统一社会党的领导下，在自己的三分之一的土地上进行了各种民主改革，建立了自己的德意志民主共和国。
    德意志民主共和国是德国历史上从来没有过的新型的国家。五年来，它的人民在德国统一社会党的领导下，以忘我的热情的劳动建设着自己的新的祖国，创造着自己的和平生活。无论在政治、经济和文化方面，德意志民主共和国人民都取得了巨大的成就，他们的生活水平正在日益提高。为了争取德国的统一，为了争取欧洲的和平和安全，德意志民主共和国正在团结着全德国人民走在斗争的前列，获得了德国爱好和平人民的支持和信任，成为德国人民争取统一、和平、民主和独立的坚强堡垒。
    但是，美国侵略集团及其追随者却不顾德国爱好和平人民的愿望和战时盟国的庄严协议。它们从一开始就企图复活德国军国主义，把德国重新变成准备战争的温床。它们推行可耻的实力政策，实行分裂德国和重新武装西德，并把西德拉入西方国家的军事侵略集团。在美国的扶植下，西德的垄断资本和军国主义分子重新掌握了大权，并力图使德国走上准备发动另一次战争的希特勒的道路。美国侵略集团及其追随者的做法，其矛头是直接针对着苏联和欧洲的人民民主国家。它们妄想推翻这些国家的社会主义的、劳动人民的政权，来建立帝国主义的奴役统治。由于美国和它的追随者的这种政策，致使十年以来，不但德国不能统一，对德和约不能缔结，而且使不祥的战争乌云又重新笼照着欧洲和全世界。
    欧洲各国爱好和平的人民，特别是德国人民坚决反对美国复活德国军国主义的政策。各国爱好和平人民的力量曾使美国策划的“欧洲防务集团”计划遭到破产。人民的反对也使巴黎协定在西欧各国议会中不能得到多数的支持，只是在美国的压力下才勉强获得通过。德国人民反对重新军国主义化，他们要求以和平民主方式恢复国家的统一。西德人民要求和平的力量也在不断增长。最近下萨克森州议会的选举中，推行重新武装西德政策的基督教民主联盟遭到惨败，就清楚地显示了人民爱好和平的强烈意志。欧洲各国人民和德国人民这种反对复活德国军国主义的意志，是阻止美国侵略集团及其追随者在欧洲推行侵略战争政策的重要力量。
    然而，美国侵略集团及其追随者却悍然违反人民的意志，决心要把重新武装西德的巴黎协定付诸实施。它们已经使巴黎协定开始生效。这将使西德军国主义势力公开重建其侵略军队，而这支军队又将拥有原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器。最富侵略性的德国军国主义重新走上军国主义的道路，这就不能不使欧洲局势发生根本的变化，使新战争的危险大大增加起来。曾经遭受过第二次世界大战的灾难的各国人民，又面临着比二次大战远为残酷的新战争威胁。
    在这种情况下，欧洲爱好和平的国家，包括德意志民主共和国在内，不得不采取一切必要的措施。参加去年在莫斯科召开的保障欧洲和平和安全会议的八国政府最近已议妥于五月十一日在华沙召开第二次会议，以讨论参加会议国家缔结友好合作互助条约的问题和组织条约参加国的联合司令部的问题。中华人民共和国政府也将派遣自己的观察员参加会议。华沙会议无疑将进一步加强欧洲爱好和平国家之间的团结，并加强它们的防御力量，以预防由于帝国主义战争势力的侵略冒险而发生的突然事变。这是苏联和其他欧洲爱好和平国家决心保卫和平和自身安全的重要行动，同时也是苏联和整个社会主义阵营坚定的和平政策的一部分。它完全符合于世界爱好和平人民的利益。中国人民坚决支持欧洲爱好和平的国家和人民为保障欧洲和平所采取的一切措施，并将同他们一道共同担当起保卫欧洲和世界和平的崇高职责。
    现在，以和平方式解决德国问题的可能性还没有丧尽。苏奥会谈所取得的重大协议，和关于对奥和约的四国大使会谈，已再一次为解决德国问题指出了道路。各国舆论，特别是德国舆论都认为，西德不参加侵略性的军事集团，拒绝外国在西德建立军事基地，并且走上协商和和平的道路，就可以使德国恢复统一，同时也有利于保障欧洲安全的利益。为此，德意志民主共和国和全德爱好和平的人民正在为废止巴黎协定和促使和平协商解决德国问题而努力。德国人民的这个正义要求，得到了欧洲各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持。我们相信，日益增长的和平力量和日益坚决地要掌握自己的命运的世界爱好和平人民，一定能够粉碎美国的战争计划。德国人民的正义事业一定能够胜利。
