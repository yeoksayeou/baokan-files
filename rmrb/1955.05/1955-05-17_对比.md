    Contrast
　　Wang Pu
    Today, two articles are published on the second page of this newspaper. One is "The People Who Blazed the Trail," which introduces the great spirit of hard struggle and self-sacrifice of some commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in participating in highway construction. The other is "Why the Basic Construction Plan Was Not Completed," which reflects the situation that many state-owned basic construction enterprises in Liaoning have not completed their plans, and particularly criticizes the departmentalism and lack of cooperation of some units. For example, an engineering project of the Lüda No. 2 Power Plant was disputed over an engineering fee of one hundred yuan, which delayed the start of construction by a month.
    These two articles constitute a sharp contrast. Similarly, it is about dealing with national engineering tasks, and similarly, it is about treating comrades on the same front. Some people are not afraid of difficulties, help others, and even do not hesitate to sacrifice themselves; others only care about themselves, ignore others, and argue endlessly. They don't care even if the project is delayed by a month or two.
    Comparing these two attitudes towards the country and towards comrades, one cannot help but feel ashamed for those departmentalists who are willing to quarrel endlessly in repeated meetings, willing to fight bureaucratic lawsuits in back-and-forth official documents, but unwilling to cooperate. Perhaps, some people will say: "These are two different situations, how can they be compared?"
    Really can't they be compared? Of course not. During the construction of the Kangzang Highway, Comrade Qin Xuewen saw that a dynamite was about to explode, and more than thirty comrades had nowhere to escape. He rushed to the gun eye selflessly and pulled out the lit fuse. In this emergency situation, when the task is very difficult and dangerous, a spirit of not fearing difficulties, considering the overall situation, and self-sacrifice is needed. Then, in basic construction, in order to solve some difficult tasks and for the overall interests of the country, why shouldn't we equally emphasize this spirit of mutual cooperation and considering the overall situation?
    In addition to the general principles, cooperation is needed in basic construction, and there are also its special reasons. Our country has not started construction for long, lacks experience, and many tasks cannot keep up. There are shortcomings in all aspects of work, and the responsibilities of each unit are not divided very scientifically and clearly. The shortcomings in the work of a design, construction, or construction unit reflect the difficulties in the entire national construction and the level of the entire national construction, which is difficult for one person to be responsible for. Therefore, it is even more necessary to rely on mutual understanding and mutual help from various units. If everyone is more proactive, cooperates, and improves work, many problems can be solved quickly.
    Mutual cooperation to overcome the difficulties in construction does not pose any danger to life after all. With a little bit of the spirit of not fearing difficulties, considering the overall situation, and self-sacrifice like Qin Xuewen, how could they argue endlessly over an engineering fee of one hundred yuan, or an installation project of seventy rivets, affecting construction for a month or three months?
    It is hoped that there will be no more incidents of mutual buck-passing and entanglement over problems that can be solved quickly, which will affect construction; it is hoped that a group of proactive, considerate of the overall situation, and fearless of difficulties with heroic spirit of people and units will emerge in strengthening the cooperation and collaboration in basic construction.

    对比

    今天，本报第二版上发表了两篇文章，一篇是“开辟道路的人们”，介绍一些人民解放军指挥员和战士在参加公路建设中艰苦奋斗、自我牺牲的伟大精神。另一篇是“为什么没有完成基本建设计划”，反映了辽宁许多国营基本建设企业单位没有完成计划的情况，特别批评了一些单位的本位主义、互不协作的现象，例如旅大第二发电厂的一项工程，为了一百元的工程费争执不下，竟使开工时间推迟了一个月。
    这两篇文章构成一个鲜明的对比。同样是对待国家的工程任务，同样是对待一条战线上的同志，有人却不怕困难，帮助别人，乃至不惜自我牺牲；有人却只顾自己，不管别人，争来吵去，那怕一个月、两个月的把工程推迟下去，也满不在乎。
    把这两种对待国家、对待同志的态度对比一下，不能不替那些情愿在三番五次的会议上争吵不休，情愿在来来往往的公文里打笔墨官司，而不肯配合协作的本位主义者感到惭愧。也许，有的人会说：“这是两种情况，怎么能比？”
    真的不能比吗？当然不是这样的。康藏公路建设中，秦学文同志看到一处炸药快要爆炸，三十多个同志无处回避，他奋不顾身地扑向炮眼，拔出已经点着的导火线。在这情况紧急、任务十分困难和危险的时候，需要不怕困难、顾全大局、自我牺牲的精神，那么，在基本建设中为了解决一些困难任务，为了国家的整体利益，为什么不应该同样强调这种互相协作、顾全大局的精神呢？
    除了一般的道理以外，基本建设中需要协作，还有它的特殊的理由。我们的国家开始建设还不久，缺乏经验，许多工作跟不上，各方面的工作都有缺点，各个单位的职责也不是划分得很科学，很明确的。一个设计，施工或建筑单位工作中的缺点，有许多是反映了整个国家建设中的困难，反映了整个国家建设的水平，很难由那一个人负责。因此，更需要依靠各个单位互相体谅、互相帮助。大家都主动一些，配合协作，改进工作，许多问题就可以很快解决。
    相互协作，克服建设中的困难，毕竟还不冒什么生命的危险，有一点半滴像秦学文那样不怕困难，顾全大局，自我牺牲的精神，何至于为一百元的工程费，为七十多个铆钉的安装工程争执不下，一个月、三个月的影响施工呢？
    希望不再发生为了本可以很快解决的问题互相扯皮、纠缠不清影响施工的事情；希望在加强基本建设的配合协作中，涌现出一批主动积极、顾全大局，不怕困难的富有英雄气概的人物和单位。
