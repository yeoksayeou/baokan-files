　　Problems in an Old Cooperative
　　Guo Junqing
　　The Oriental Radiance Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kaoshan Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, is an old cooperative established in the winter of 1952. The cooperative's production has been increasing year by year. In 1954, the average yield per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu) was 4 shi 7 dou 7 sheng, which was 15.7% higher than the yield per hectare of the local mutual aid teams, and 18% higher than the cooperative's yield in 1953. The income of the vast majority of cooperative members has increased. Precisely because of this, the district committee and village branch believed that this was a good cooperative, so they no longer paid attention to its leadership, and could not promptly help solve the problems that arose in the cooperative's development.
　　What problems exist in this cooperative?
　　First, it has not appropriately increased production content and expanded its scope of business with the development of production. On the one hand, there is no outlet for surplus labor, and on the other hand, many conditions for increased production have not been utilized. Production cannot meet the demands of cooperative members, and some cooperative members are developing in incorrect directions. This village has the conditions to expand its cultivated land area, but the cooperative has not expanded its cultivated land area accordingly with the increase in labor and the improvement of labor efficiency. In 1953, each laborer in the cooperative bore an average of 5 hectares and 4 mu of cultivated land, which was reduced to 4 hectares and 5 mu in 1954 due to the increase in labor. In terms of sideline production, there is no production activity other than pulling carts. In the past, farmers engaged in activities such as cutting reeds and picking hazelnuts during the slack season, but after joining the cooperative, these activities have now stopped because the cooperative does not manage them. The cooperative is located near the mountains and has good conditions for grazing and afforestation, but these have not been utilized. When the cooperative was first established, it opposed the practice of blindly setting up large stalls to engage in diversified operations, but after two or three years of running the cooperative, the cooperative cadres still used old viewpoints to treat new problems, and even understood "agriculture as the mainstay" as "agriculture as the only thing." This is also one of the reasons for the simple production content. In addition, there is also a certain degree of blindness in terms of crop planting. For example, the area of three low-yield crops, wheat, soybeans, and millet, accounts for 67% of the cultivated land area in the cooperative, while the area of three high-yield crops, corn, millet, and sorghum, accounts for only 25%. The average yield per hectare of the latter is almost twice as high as that of the former, but it has been planted in the same way for two years without any change.
　　The inability to increase the number of draft animals and the gradual decline in quality also affect the further development of production. The cooperative cultivates 200 hectares of land and has a total of 30 draft horses, of which 11 are old horses over the age of 11, and 4 are no longer suitable for use. Cooperative members are unwilling to buy horses to join the cooperative, and the cooperative lacks public accumulation and is unable to purchase them. The lack of horsepower not only prevents the expansion of cultivated land area, but also limits the deep plowing of existing land.
　　The cooperative's leading cadres excessively emphasize giving cooperative members more dividends to show the superiority of the cooperative, while neglecting appropriate public accumulation. In 1953, the cooperative's production increased, and the income of the vast majority of cooperative members increased, but the cooperative did not retain any public reserve fund or public welfare fund. Some people reflected that this was a case of "the cooperative being thin and the cooperative members being fat." They did not plan to retain any when distributing in 1954, and only retained 5% of the total income as public reserve fund and public welfare fund after persuasion from county and district cadres.
　　Due to the overly monotonous production content of the cooperative, there are very few jobs suitable for the elderly, the weak, and women. Five elderly people who are able to work are often idle at home. These elderly people complain: "I can't do the work they ask me to do, and they don't give me the work I can do. It's like I've retired like an old master before entering socialism!" Due to the small amount of production content, two abnormal sentiments have begun to emerge among cooperative members: some of the wealthier cooperative members feel that the income in the cooperative is too low to satisfy their needs, and are keen to develop their individual economies. They believe that buying horses to join the cooperative is not as good as credit deposits, deposits are not as good as lending money, and lending money is not as good as raising cattle at home (individuals buy cattle and hire people to graze them). The principal and interest at home will never suffer losses. In the past two years, the private raising of cattle by cooperative members has developed rapidly. Now the number of cattle privately owned by cooperative members has increased from 12 in 1952 to 42. There are 26 households in the cooperative that raise cattle, accounting for 70% of the cooperative members' households. In addition, there are 11 cooperative members who lend money. These cooperative members are not active in working in the cooperative, are not concerned about the cooperative, and are becoming more and more enthusiastic about developing their individual economies. Another part of the poorer cooperative members feel that the cooperative has few production avenues, and they cannot engage in other production activities, so they hope to establish advanced cooperatives as soon as possible to change the current situation.
　　Secondly, the cooperative's political work is weak, and the socialist and collectivist education of cooperative members is very poor. Some cooperative members feel that the production in the cooperative cannot meet their requirements for increasing income, and they are "in the cooperative but their hearts are outside the cooperative." However, their erroneous thoughts and behaviors have not received the necessary criticism in the cooperative. The correct opinions of some poor peasant activists who are enthusiastic about the cooperative are also often not given strong support. Just looking at the situation of treating public property, a new set of rope suits can be used for two years in the mutual aid team, but only for one year in the cooperative. There is a shortage of rice straw locally, and the price is high, but the cooperative wasted more than 500 bundles of rice straw. The loss and waste of grain is also very serious. Crops in the field are wantonly trampled by livestock. After the crops are brought to the threshing ground, stray livestock and poultry are constantly present. Cooperative members not only do not try to take care of their livestock, but are afraid that their livestock will not eat enough, and even close the gate at night and not allow the cattle to enter the yard, letting them eat grain in the threshing ground. A female cooperative member saw that her pig did not go to the threshing ground and felt that she had suffered a loss, so she used beans to lure it there. No less than 20 shi of grain is lost in a threshing ground during an autumn harvest. Some cooperative members feel distressed when they see this phenomenon. They raise their opinions, but no one pays attention to them, and the cooperative has not taken effective measures to stop it.
　　An unsound leadership structure is one of the important reasons for the above-mentioned problems in this cooperative. Five of the nine management committee members in this cooperative are well-to-do middle peasants, among whom there are three people who the cooperative members say play a "blocking role" in the cooperative. There are often disputes within the management committee regarding the handling of some issues, but incorrect opinions often override correct opinions. Taking the lead in not advocating retaining public reserve funds, not wanting to engage in basic construction, not wanting to buy draft animals to join the cooperative, and not wanting to repay national loans are all led by these people.
　　After discovering these problems, the local district and village cadres and party organizations are helping this cooperative to rectify itself.
　　The problems reflected by this cooperative are not isolated. These problems exist to varying degrees in many old cooperatives. Some leading cadres are only satisfied with the continuous development of the cooperative and the continuous growth of grain production, and think that there are no major problems. In particular, the selection of the cooperative's leading backbone is not based on the two conditions of impartiality and competence, and the cultivation of poor peasant activists is insufficient. The inability to truly grasp the leadership in the hands of impartial and competent farmers who can implement policies and have a higher level of awareness is a problem that deserves great attention.

　　一个老社中存在的问题
　　郭俊卿
    黑龙江省克山县靠山村东方光芒农业生产合作社，是一九五二年冬季建立起来的老社。这个社的生产是逐年上升的，一九五四年每垧地（合十五市亩）平均产量四石七斗七升，比当地互助组每垧地的产量高百分之十五点七，比社里一九五三年的产量提高了百分之十八。绝大部分社员的收入都有所增加。正因为如此，区委和村支部都认为这是个好社，就不再注意对它的领导，对社内在发展中所出现的问题，也就不能及时帮助解决。
    这个社存在哪些问题呢？
    首先是没有随着生产发展，适当增加生产内容和扩大经营范围，一方面剩余劳力没有出路，另一方面许多增产条件没被利用起来，生产不能满足社员要求，有些社员就向不正确的方向发展。这个村是有扩大耕地面积的条件的，但是社并没有随着劳力的增多和劳动效率的提高，相应地扩大耕地面积。一九五三年社里每个劳动力平均负担耕地五垧四亩，一九五四年因劳力增加而减为四垧五亩。在副业生产方面，除拉脚以外，什么生产活动也没有。过去农民在挂锄期间进行割靰鞡草、采榛子等活动，入社后因社里不管，这些活动现在也停止了。这个社靠山近，有放牧、造林等良好条件也没利用。社初办时曾经反对过盲目摆大摊子搞多种经营的作法，但是社办了两三年，社干部还是用旧观点来对待新问题，甚至把“农业为主”了解为“农业唯一”，这也是形成生产内容单纯的原因之一。此外，在作物种植方面也存在一定的盲目性。如小麦、大豆、糜子三种低产作物面积占社内耕地面积百分之六十七，玉米、谷子、高粱三种高产作物面积却只占百分之二十五，后者比前者每垧平均产量几乎高一倍，可是二年来还是照老样种植，一直没改变。
    社内耕畜数量不能增添，质量逐渐降低，也影响生产的进一步发展。全社种二百垧地，共有三十匹耕马，其中十一岁以上的老马有十一匹，有四匹已不好使用。社员不愿买马入社，社内缺乏公共积累也无力购买。马力不足，不仅不能扩大耕地面积，现有土地的深耕也受到限制。
    社内领导干部过分强调给社员多分红来表现社的优越性，而忽视适当的公共积累。一九五三年全社增产，绝大多数社员收入增加，但社内公积金和公益金则分文没留。有人反映这是“社瘦社员肥”。一九五四年分配时他们还不打算留，经过县区干部说服才留了占总收入百分之五的公积金和公益金。
    由于社的生产内容过分单调，适合老弱和妇女劳力干的活很少，有五个能劳动的老年人经常在家闲着。这些老年人发牢骚说：叫干的活干不了，能干的活不给我，没进社会主义就像老太爷子似的歇起来了！由于生产内容少，在社员中已开始显露出两种不正常的情绪：一部分较为富裕的社员觉着社内收入少，不解渴，热心于发展个人经济，他们认为买马入社不如信贷存款，存款不如放债，放债不如自家牧牛（个人买牛雇人放牧），本利在家到什么时候也不吃亏。二年来社员家庭牧牛迅速发展，现在社员私人所有的牧牛已由一九五二年的十二头发展到四十二头。全社有牧牛的有二十六户，占社员户数的百分之七十，另外还有十一户社员放债。这些社员在社劳动不积极，对社不关心，发展个人经济的劲头越来越大。另一部分较贫苦的社员，觉得社的生产门路少，自己又不能进行其他生产活动，希望快点办高级社，改变现状。
    其次是社的政治工作薄弱，对社员的社会主义和集体主义教育很差。有一部分社员觉得社内生产满足不了他们增加收入的要求，他们“身在社内，心在社外”。但是他们错误的思想和行为在社内并没有受到必要的批判。一些对社热心的贫农积极分子的正确意见也经常得不到有力的支持。单从对待公共财产的情况来看吧，一付新的绳套在互助组时能使用两年，在社里只使一年。当地谷草缺，价格高，社里却浪费了五百多捆谷草。粮食的损失浪费也很严重，庄稼在地里就被牲畜随便糟蹋，庄稼上场后，散畜家禽整天不断，社员不仅不设法看管自己的牲畜，反而怕自己的牲畜吃的少，甚至晚间关上大门不给牛进院，让它随便到场园里去吃粮食。有个女社员看自己的猪不到场园里去，觉得吃了亏，就用豆子逗引它去。一个秋收场园里损失粮食不下二十石。有些社员看到这种现象感到心疼，他们提出意见也没人理睬，社里也没有采取有效的办法来制止。
    领导机构不健全，是这个社存在上述问题的重要原因之一。这个社内的九名管理委员中有五名是富裕中农，其中有三个人，社员们说他们在社内是起“挡头作用”的。对于一些问题的处理，在管理委员会内经常有争论，但不正确的意见常常压倒了正确的意见。不主张留公积金，不愿搞基本建设，不愿买耕畜入社，不愿还国家贷款等等，都是由这些人带头。
    发现这些问题后，当地区村干部和党组织正在帮助这个社进行整顿。
    这个社所反映出的问题，并不是个别的。这些问题，不少老社里都或轻或重地存在着。有些领导干部只满足于社的不断发展，粮食产量的不断增长，就以为没有什么大问题了。特别是对社的领导骨干不是从公道、能干两个条件来选拔，对贫农积极分子培养不够，不能把领导权确实掌握在公道能干、能贯彻政策、觉悟较高的农民手中，这是十分值得注意的问题。
