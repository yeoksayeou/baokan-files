To the Editor:

　　On March 23rd, three elderly farmers (Zhang Youxiang, Yang Jinbao, Zhang Yougan) arrived at our county's People's Government with migration certificates issued by the Public Security Bureau of Jiangdu County People's Government in Jiangsu Province, requesting travel expenses and food allowances to hunt otters elsewhere.

　　They themselves said that since their hometown suffered from floods last year, they left their hometown to make a living hunting otters in other places. From Jiangsu to Jiangxi and then to Guangdong, they have not caught a single otter, and their living expenses along the way have been entirely maintained by asking for money from local governments. According to the numbers recorded on the back of the migration certificate, they have received a total of 83.57 yuan in subsidies from the government. Specifically: Taihe County in Jiangxi Province gave 4 yuan, Xingguo County gave 4.5 yuan, Huichang County gave 14.8 yuan, Xunwu County gave 17.94 yuan; Meixian County in Guangdong gave 30 yuan, Shantou gave 4.23 yuan, Chaoyang gave 2.1 yuan, and Huilai gave 6 yuan. It is estimated that for them to return from Guangdong to Jiangdu County, they would need at least another 200 yuan in subsidies. If this money were directly used for agricultural production, it would definitely increase the harvest.

　　I believe that it is inappropriate for the Public Security Bureau of Jiangdu County People's Government to issue migration certificates casually, allowing them to drift around under the guise of hunting otters. The Jiangdu County People's Government should have a planned leadership and organize local disaster victims for production, and the civil affairs departments in various places should also be more cautious when issuing subsidies.

　　从江都到广东打獭编辑同志：
    三月二十三日有三位老年的农民（张有相、杨金宝、张有干）拿着江苏省江都县人民政府公安局开给的往外打獭的迁移证，到我县人民政府要求发给路费、伙食费，让他们到别处去打獭。
    他们自己说自从去年家乡遭受水灾以后，他们便离开家乡往别地打獭谋生，从江苏到江西又到广东，都没有打着一条獭，而一路上的生活全是向各地政府要钱维持的。根据迁移证后面所记的数字来看，他们共向政府领取补助费八十三元五角七分。计：江西泰和县发给四元，兴国县发给四元五角，会昌县发给十四元八角，寻邬县发给十七元九角四分；广东梅县发给三十元，汕头发给四元二角三分，潮阳发给二元一角，惠来发给六元。估计他们由广东再回到江都县，最少还要补助二百元。如果把这笔费用直接用到农业生产上去，一定会增加收获。
    我认为江都县人民政府公安局随便发给迁移证，让他们在打獭的名义下到处漂流，是不妥当的。江都县人民政府应该有计划地领导和组织当地灾民进行生产，各地民政部门发放补助费时也应该慎重一些。广东惠来县民政科　罗建、鸿理
