　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 24th. The Chongqing Branch of the Chinese Writers Association and the Chongqing Federation of Literary and Art Workers jointly held a symposium on the 23rd to denounce Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people crimes. More than 40 people, including Zhou Qinyue, Chen Shufang, Zeng Ke, and Zhu Dannan, spoke at the meeting. They unanimously believed that the materials revealed by Shu Wu and recently in Chongqing clearly showed that the Hu Feng anti-Party clique was the most insidious enemy hidden under the banner of Marxism-Leninism. They pointed out that during the Anti-Japanese War, the Hu Feng anti-Party clique entrenched itself in Chongqing for several years, and many writers and young people interested in literature and art were deceived and poisoned by them. In the future, they must launch a resolute struggle against the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, help those who have been deceived and poisoned to draw a clear line between themselves and the enemy, and at the same time, the members of the Hu Feng clique in Chongqing must thoroughly expose the materials of Hu Feng's anti-Party activities and confess to the Party. The conference unanimously demanded the removal of Hu Feng's position as a representative of the National People's Congress and other positions.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 24th. More than 170 people from the cultural and artistic circles of Sichuan Province and Chengdu held a symposium on the 23rd. More than 20 people, including Peng Dixian, Sha Ting, Chen Weimo, and Lin Ruji, spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they examined the implementation of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy by literary and artistic workers in Sichuan Province since liberation and denounced the Hu Feng anti-Party and anti-people clique's conspiracies. Peng Dixian, president of Sichuan University, pointed out that Hu Feng was an anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary individualistic careerist, and he had become an enemy of the people. Many people revealed in their speeches the destructive activities carried out by the Hu Feng anti-Party clique in Sichuan and the poisoning of Sichuan. They also called on the literary and artistic circles of the province to further raise their vigilance, expose Hu Feng's criminal activities, strengthen theoretical study, and implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy. Finally, the participants unanimously demanded the removal of Hu Feng's position as a representative of the National People's Congress and other positions, and his expulsion from the Writers Association.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 23rd. Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary behavior has aroused strong anger among the people of all strata in Wuhan. Chao Zhen, Liu Jingcheng, Zhou Bo, Huo Danian, Zheng Xiuzi, and Yang Wenhan, six students from the Chinese Department of Wuhan University, pointed out: "Hu Feng is not a petty-bourgeois revolutionary writer at all, but a bourgeois individualistic careerist, the organizer and leader of the anti-Party clique." Liu Zhongyu, a rural cultural worker in Hubei, demanded a thorough reckoning of Hu Feng's sophistry in covering up his anti-Party conspiracies. A group of young literary workers from the Literature Department of the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Workers held a symposium on the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, and they were all angered by Hu Feng's cunning attitude of continuing to deceive the Party and the people.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 21st. On May 19th, the Xi'an Branch of the Chinese Writers Association invited more than 40 people from the literary and artistic circles of Xi'an to hold a symposium. More than 20 people spoke at the meeting, and everyone unanimously pointed out that Hu Feng consistently and resolutely stood on the anti-Party and anti-people position, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, and cunningly and viciously attacking the Party and the revolutionary camp. They also pointed out that the root cause of Hu Feng's mistakes was not, as he "examined," "taking the revolutionary nature and position of the petty bourgeoisie as the revolutionary nature and position of the working class," because he was hostile to the Party and the people, and everywhere he tried to win over young people in an attempt to expand his anti-Party and anti-people small clique.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th. More than 100 people from the literary and artistic circles of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City held a symposium on the 23rd to denounce Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people conspiracies. Wang Huanan, Cai Tianxin, Chen Ti, Kong Fang, Wan Laitian, Qin Youmei, Han Shaoyun, and others spoke at the meeting. Cai Tianxin said: Hu Feng and his conspiracy clique must completely lay down their weapons and hand over all anti-Party and anti-people materials. Everyone expressed great indignation in their speeches at Hu Feng's past attempts to open up a base for conspiracy activities in the Northeast. They unanimously demanded the revocation of Hu Feng's qualifications as a representative of the National People's Congress and all his positions in revolutionary literary and artistic work.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 23rd. The Zhejiang Federation of Literary and Art Workers held an enlarged meeting of members in Hangzhou on the 22nd to discuss how to further expose the Hu Feng anti-Party clique's conspiracies. Speakers expressed infinite indignation at Hu Feng's anti-Party activities and hypocritical self-criticism; speakers pointed out that all Hu Feng members in Zhejiang Province who are willing to repent should thoroughly confess to the people, provide materials on Hu Feng's conspiracy activities, and start anew.
