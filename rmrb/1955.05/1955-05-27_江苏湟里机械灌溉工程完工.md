Completion of the Huangli Mechanical Irrigation Project in Jiangsu

The largest mechanical irrigation project in Jiangsu Province, the Huangli Irrigation Project, has been successfully completed, and test runs and water release were carried out at the north and south pumping stations on May 16th and 20th respectively. The completion of this mechanical irrigation project has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of farmers. At present, farmers are transplanting rice seedlings and accumulating fertilizer, and are preparing to plant an additional 7,000 mu of rice.

The Huangli irrigation area is located in the center of the plateau area between Taohu Lake and Gehu Lake in Wujin and Jintan counties in southern Jiangsu. The soil quality in this area is very good, but the yield per unit area has always been very low due to lack of water sources. In November 1954, the state started construction of a mechanical irrigation project here. After more than half a year of hard work by more than 16,000 migrant workers, a total of one million cubic meters of earth were excavated, and the Huangli River, which was divided into thirteen sections, was dredged. In this way, the abundant water from Taohu Lake and Gehu Lake can be pumped out to irrigate the fields. This mechanical irrigation area has fifteen water pumps. Simultaneous operation and water release can replace 9,600 laborers for water lifting. After the project releases water, this year it can protect 47,500 mu of farmland from drought. In the future, the irrigation area can be expanded to more than 60,000 mu. (Wu Rong)

　  江苏湟里机械灌溉工程完工
    江苏省最大的机械灌溉工程——湟里灌溉工程已胜利完工，并在五月十六和二十两日，分别在南北两机埠试车放水。这个机械灌溉工程的建成，大大鼓舞了农民的生产积极性。目前农民正在插秧积肥，并准备多种七千亩水稻。
    湟里灌溉区位于江苏南部洮湖和滆湖之间的武进、金坛县境的高原地区中心。这一带土质很好，只因水源缺乏而单位面积产量一向很低。一九五四年十一月，国家在这里动工兴建机械灌溉工程，经过一万六千多民工半年多的辛勤劳动，共挖了一百万土方，挖通了分隔为十三段的湟里河，这样就可把水源丰富的洮湖和滆湖的水抽出灌田。这个机械灌溉区共有十五部抽水机，同时开车放水，可以代替九千六百个劳动力车水。工程放水后，今年即可使四万七千五百亩农田免受旱灾威胁，今后灌溉面积还可扩大到六万多亩。　　（吴镕）
