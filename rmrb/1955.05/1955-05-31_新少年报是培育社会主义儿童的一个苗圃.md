The New Children's Daily is a Nursery for Cultivating Socialist Children
Ji Yin

In the cause of cultivating and educating China's new socialist generation, newspapers and periodicals aimed at children play a huge role. In recent years, China has published many kinds of children's newspapers and periodicals (currently there are six at the central level alone), and the New Children's Daily is one of the better ones.

The New Children's Daily was founded on February 16, 1946, in Shanghai under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang. In those dark years, under the leadership of our Party, it educated and united the vast number of children and became the most popular reading material for children in Shanghai under Kuomintang rule at that time. In December 1948, the New Children's Daily was shut down by the reactionary Kuomintang government. It was not until June 1949, with the liberation of Shanghai, that it met with its wide readership again. Soon, this newspaper officially became the team newspaper of the Young Pioneers in East China. Since March of this year, the New Children's Daily has been changed to a national children's newspaper mainly aimed at middle-grade children in primary schools, and is directly led by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. The readership of the newspaper has been further expanded. Before liberation, the circulation of the New Children's Daily did not exceed 10,000 copies at most. Now it has increased to 1,198,000 copies and continues to increase. Its footprint has spread throughout the provinces and regions of the country.

The New Children's Daily is a newspaper with the characteristics of a children's publication. The four-page newspaper has many vivid stories and interesting pictures. When children open the New Children's Daily, they cannot help but be attracted by this small newspaper. The newspaper uses vivid and concrete facts and cartoons that are easily accepted and understood by children to report on major domestic and international events, report on the achievements of national construction, and conduct patriotism education and internationalism education for children. Here, you won't see strings of boring numbers and dull, lengthy articles, but you can get a glimpse of many moving scenes in the country's construction, such as "Airplanes Help with Farming," "Treating Cattle and Sheep," "Rare Fruit Trees," "The Motherland's Large Salt Lake," "Floating Stores," and so on. These short articles, each no more than 150 words, timely and vividly reflect many activities of national construction. The newspaper pays great attention to grasping an interesting event to educate children with rich ideological content.

The New Children's Daily regards the education of children in communist moral character as an important task. The newspaper regularly publishes various stories of heroic models, fairy tales, folk tales, and various model deeds of children themselves to inspire children and cultivate new qualities in children such as abiding by collective discipline, courage, honesty, fearlessness of difficulties, and selflessness. Recently, the newspaper published two articles, "It's Not My Money, I Don't Want It" and "Teacher Zhang, This is Your Money," which narrated the story of two children not wanting money that they should not have. These two short articles aroused a general reaction among the children, and many children wrote to the newspaper to express their desire to learn from their spirit of honesty and selflessness. Gong Guangyuan, a Young Pioneer from Dajian District, Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, wrote a letter saying that after reading these two articles, he couldn't sleep for two nights and finally decided to return a calligraphy brush he took from a classmate last year and apologize to him.

Labor education is a regular and central theme in the New Children's Daily's communist education for children. The newspaper repeatedly educates children to love labor, love the working people, and love the fruits of labor in connection with various phenomena in children's daily lives. Before the wheat harvest last year, the editorial department received more than 100 letters reflecting that children in rural areas often went to the fields to pick wheat stalks to make whistles to play with. The newspaper published a cartoon entitled "Don't Be Friends with Field Mice," depicting two field mice hiding aside and snickering: "This kid is actually our friend!" This cartoon quickly spread in rural primary schools. Du Kui, a student at Dujiacun Elementary School in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, wrote to the newspaper saying that he felt very embarrassed after seeing the picture because he often went to the fields to pull wheat stalks to make whistles to blow after school every day. In the future, he must be a friend of the peasant uncles and not a friend of the field mice. Later, the matter of not pulling wheat stalks further developed in the lives of the children, and they raised and opposed many phenomena of wasting crops of the same nature. In March of this year, the newspaper published a suggestion from the children of Wangzhuang Village Elementary School in Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, about planting sunflowers and castor beans, calling on everyone to respond, and introduced the uses and planting methods of sunflowers and castor beans in pictures in the newspaper on the same day. This call also quickly received results. Children at Liangyuan Elementary School in Feidong County, Anhui Province, not only prepared to open a "castor bean plantation," but also collected 3,000 castor bean seeds and sent them to two schools in Shanghai and the New Children's Daily.

Helping children learn various basic knowledge, actively guiding children to pursue knowledge, and gradually cultivating their interest and habits in studying knowledge is an important task of children's newspapers and periodicals. The New Children's Daily often occupies a page with articles in this regard. Because the understanding ability of middle-grade primary school students is still poor, the newspaper mainly uses interesting and vivid methods such as science fairy tales, science stories, and science picture riddles to carry out knowledge education for children. Young readers often ask the newspaper to answer various questions encountered in daily life, which involve many aspects such as astronomy, geography, biology, and physics: such as "Why does the moon follow me?" "Why doesn't it hurt to cut hair and nails?" "Why do glutinous rice balls sink first and then float?" and so on. The New Children's Daily has a column called "Old Doctor's Mailbox," which specializes in answering such knowledge-based questions and is very popular with children. In knowledge education, the newspaper also pays attention to correcting children's bad habits of not paying attention to hygiene and teaches them to pay attention to cleanliness and health. For example, publishing articles written by doctors to tell children how to protect their ears, eyes, skin, etc.

In educating young readers in various aspects, the New Children's Daily shows the characteristics of being good at inspiring and guiding children. The newspaper often lets children raise questions themselves in the newspaper, and then lets the children solve the problems themselves, and the newspaper organizes them from the middle. Last year, the New Children's Daily cooperated with the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League to carry out a "Do Something for the School" campaign. This was proposed by the children of Zhaozhou Road Elementary School in Shanghai, and after the support of the newspaper, it received a wide response. Children in many elementary schools in East China acted to do what they could for the school, some paving roads, some planting trees, some repairing damaged books, ... which greatly moved the teachers. The planting activities currently underway in many elementary schools are also due to the newspaper's support for the readers' initiative. Through these activities, the newspaper has effectively cultivated children's initiative and creativity, and has established friendly connections between children in cities and rural areas, and between this region and that region.

Closely establishing close contact with young readers and firmly uniting a large number of young readers around the newspaper is a good tradition of the New Children's Daily. Before liberation, this newspaper was able to persist in publishing for nearly three years in a harsh environment, which was inseparable from the enthusiastic support of young readers. When the newspaper could not be distributed, young readers would automatically go to sell it. A very deep friendship was established between the newspaper and the readers. When the newspaper was closed down, many readers stood at the door of the newspaper and wept. The young readers in the past have now grown up, but many of them still maintain a close relationship with the New Children's Daily and often write to the newspaper to report on their work. This tradition of close contact with the masses is still being carried forward by the New Children's Daily. Now it receives four or five hundred letters from readers every day. Young readers regard the newspaper as their closest teacher and friend and tell the newspaper what is on their minds.

To run a children's newspaper well, there must be support from social forces, otherwise it is unimaginable. The New Children's Daily also unites a group of enthusiasts for children's education around it, including university professors, scientists, engineers, doctors, writers, primary and secondary school teachers, and so on. Some of them review and proofread manuscripts for the newspaper, some answer scientific questions for the newspaper's readers, some provide the newspaper with opinions on editing plans, and some directly write manuscripts for the newspaper. Eighty percent of the manuscripts on scientific knowledge on the newspaper are written by them; there are also many literary works loved by children, which come from the hands of veteran writers. Among the social forces united by the newspaper, elementary school teachers and counselors are the most important forces. Now the newspaper regularly contacts more than 600 teachers and counselors, and more than 300 teachers and children's workers serve as special correspondents for the newspaper.

The New Children's Daily, a nursery for cultivating a new socialist generation, still has many areas that need to be further improved. This newspaper has been changed to a newspaper aimed at middle-grade children this year, but it has not been transformed enough in this regard. Some articles are still too long and too deep, and some are too thin to properly suit the level and interest of children in the third and fourth grades. The newspaper is still somewhat one-sided in connecting with reality, placing too much emphasis on cities and not enough on reflecting rural life, placing too much emphasis on East China and not enough on reflecting the national situation. There are also some shortcomings in closely combining with some important current tasks of the Communist Youth League. For example, the guiding role of the newspaper is not timely and effective enough in the work of carrying out scientific and technological activities among children recently. These shortcomings are being overcome. However, some good experiences in the work of the New Children's Daily are worth referring to by other children's newspapers and periodicals. (Attached picture)

　　新少年报是培育社会主义儿童的一个苗圃
　　季音
    在培养教育我国社会主义新一代的事业中，以儿童为对象的报刊发挥着巨大的作用。近几年来我国已经出版了许多种儿童报刊（目前仅中央一级的就有六种），新少年报是比较优秀的儿童报刊之一。
    新少年报是一九四六年二月十六日在国民党匪帮统治下的上海创刊的。在那些黑暗的年月中，它在我们党的领导下，教育和团结了广大儿童，成为当时国民党统治下的上海最受孩子喜爱的读物。一九四八年十二月，新少年报遭到国民党反动政府封闭。直到一九四九年六月，随着上海的解放，它才重新同广大小读者见面。不久，这个报纸正式成为华东区少年先锋队的队报。从今年三月起，新少年报又改为以小学中年级儿童为主要对象的全国性儿童报纸，由青年团中央直接领导，报纸的读者更为扩大了。新少年报在解放前的发行数量最多不超过一万份，现在已增加到一百十九万八千份，并在继续增加。它的足迹遍及全国各省区。
    新少年报是一张具有儿童报刊特色的报纸，四开的报面上有很多生动的故事和有趣的图画。当孩子们翻开新少年报，他们就不能不为这张小小的报纸所吸引。报纸通过儿童易于接受和理解的、生动具体的事实和漫画，来报道国内外大事，报道国家建设的成就，向儿童进行爱国主义教育和国际主义教育。这里看不到一串串枯燥的数目字和沉闷的大块文章，但却可以窥见祖国建设中的许多动人景象，像“飞机帮忙种田”、“给牛羊治病”、“稀奇的果树”、“祖国的大盐池”、“水上商店”，等等。这些每篇不超过一百五十字的小文章，及时而生动地反映着国家建设的许多活动。报纸很注意抓住一件有趣的事情，来向儿童进行富于思想内容的教育。
    新少年报把对儿童进行共产主义道德品质的教育，作为自己的一项重要任务。报纸上经常刊载各种英雄模范故事、童话、民间故事和孩子们自己的各种模范事迹，来感染儿童，培养儿童遵守集体纪律、勇敢、诚实、不怕困难、大公无私的新品质。最近，报上曾刊登了“不是我的钱，我不要”，“张老师，这是你的钱”两篇文章，叙述两个孩子不要不应得的钱。这两篇短文在孩子们中间引起了普遍的反应，许多孩子给报纸写信表示要学习他们这种诚实无私的精神。江苏省启东县大尖区的少年先锋队员龚光元来信说，他读了这两篇文章后，两夜睡不着觉，最后决定把去年拿走同学的一枝毛笔送还给他，并向他道歉。
      劳动教育是新少年报向孩子们进行共产主义教育的经常的中心内容。报纸结合儿童日常生活中的各种现象，反复地教育儿童热爱劳动，热爱劳动人民，热爱劳动果实。去年麦收前，编辑部先后收到一百多封来信，反映农村里的孩子常常到庄稼地里摘麦秸作哨子玩。报纸就登出了一幅漫画，题目是“不要做田鼠的朋友”，画着两只田鼠躲在一边讪笑：“这小孩子原来是我们的朋友！”这幅漫画很快就在农村小学里流传开来。浙江省萧山县杜家村小学学生杜葵写信给报社说，他看了这幅画觉得很难为情，因为他每天放学也常到田里拔麦秸做哨子吹，今后他一定要做农民伯伯的朋友，不做田鼠的朋友。以后，不拔麦秸这件事在孩子们的生活中又有了进一步的发展，他们把许多同样性质的糟蹋农作物的现象都提了出来加以反对。今年三月间，报纸又发表了江苏省无锡县王庄村小学的儿童关于种植向日葵和蓖麻的建议，号召大家来响应，并在当天报上用图画介绍了向日葵、蓖麻的用处和种植法。这个号召也迅速收到了效果。安徽肥东县梁园小学的孩子不但准备辟一个“蓖麻种植园”，并搜集了三千个蓖麻子，送给上海的两个学校和新少年报。
      帮助儿童学习各种基础知识，积极地引导儿童去追求知识，使他们逐步养成钻研知识的兴趣和习惯，这是儿童报刊的重要任务。新少年报在这方面的文字经常占有一个版面的篇幅。由于中年级的小学生的理解能力还差，报纸主要是采用科学童话、科学故事和科学画谜等生动有趣的方式来向孩子们进行知识教育。小读者们经常向报纸提出日常生活中遇到的各种疑问要求解答，这些问题牵涉到天文、地理、生物、物理等许多方面：如“为什么月亮会跟着我走？”“剪头发、指甲为什么不痛？”“汤团怎么先沉后浮？”等等。新少年报设有一栏叫“老博士信箱”，专门解答这类知识性的问题，很受孩子们的欢迎。在知识教育中，报纸还注意纠正儿童中不注意卫生的不良习惯，教导他们注意清洁和健康。如发表医生写的文章，告诉儿童如何保护耳朵、眼睛、皮肤等。
    新少年报在对小读者进行各方面的教育中，都表现出善于启发和诱导儿童的特点。报纸经常让孩子们自己在报上提出问题，又让孩子们自己来解决问题，报纸则从中加以组织。去年新少年报曾配合青年团上海市委开展了一次“为学校做一件事”的运动。这就是上海肇周路小学的少年先锋队的孩子们提出的，经过报纸的支持后，得到了广泛的响应。华东各地许多小学校的孩子们都行动起来，为学校做他们力所能及的事情，有的铺路，有的植树，有的修补损坏了的图书，……使老师们都大为感动。目前许多小学正在进行的种植活动，也是由于报纸支持了读者的倡议而开展起来的。报纸通过这些活动，有效地培养了孩子们的主动精神和创造才能，并且使城市和农村、这个地区和那个地区的孩子们建立了友谊的联系。
    密切地同小读者建立亲密的联系，把大量小读者巩固地团结在报纸的周围，是新少年报一个很好的传统。解放以前这个报纸能够在恶劣的环境中坚持出版将近三年，是同小读者们的热情支持分不开的。报纸发行不出去，小读者们便自动去推销。报社同读者之间建立了非常深厚的友谊，当报社被封闭时，好多读者站在报社门口流泪。过去的小读者现在已长大成人，但他们之中很多人还同新少年报保持着亲密的关系，经常写信给报社报告自己的工作情况。这种同群众亲密联系的传统，现在仍被新少年报继续发扬着。现在它每天都收到四、五百封读者来信。小读者把报纸当成了最亲密的老师和朋友，把心里话都告诉报纸。
    要办好儿童报刊，必须有社会力量的支援，否则是不能想像的。新少年报在自己的周围也团结着
  一批儿童教育事业的热心者，包括大学教授、科学家、工程师、医师、作家、中小学教师等等。他们有的为报社审校稿件，有的为报纸读者解答科学问题，有的向报社提供关于编辑计划的意见，有的直接给报纸写稿。报上有关科学知识的稿件百分之八十都是他们写的；也有许多为儿童喜爱的文艺作品，出自老作家的手笔。在报纸所团结的社会力量中，小学教师和辅导员是最重要的力量。现在报纸经常联系的有六百多个教师和辅导员，有三百多个教师和儿童工作者担任了报纸的特约通讯员。
    新少年报这个培育社会主义新一代的苗圃，也还有不少地方需要继续加以改进。这个报纸今年已改为以中年级儿童为对象的报纸，但它在这方面还转变得不够，有的文章还嫌太长太深，有的又过分单薄，不能恰当地适合三、四年级儿童的水平和兴趣。报纸在联系实际上还有些片面，偏重城市而反映农村生活不够，偏重华东而反映全国情况不够。在密切结合青年团当前的一些重要工作上也有些缺点，例如最近在孩子中展开科学工艺活动的工作，报纸的指导作用还不够及时有力。这些缺点正在克服中。而新少年报工作中的一些好的经验，却是值得其他儿童报刊参考的。（附图片）
