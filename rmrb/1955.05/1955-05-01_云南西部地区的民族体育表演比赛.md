　　Ethnic Sports Performance Competition in Western Yunnan

　　In April, people of all ethnic groups in western Yunnan held an ethnic sports performance competition in Dali County. More than two hundred athletes participated in the performance competition, including more than twenty ethnic groups such as Dai, Jingpo, Kawa, Achang, Minjia, Naxi, Tibetan, and Han. Among them were seventy-three-year-old white-haired elders, as well as children as young as twelve years old; there were production models, as well as folk artists.
　　The performance programs reflected the rich variety of ethnic sports. All performance competitions and specially invited performances of ethnic dances, folk sports, martial arts, horse racing, equestrianism, crossbow shooting, musketry, slingshot shooting, and wrestling, totaling more than ninety programs, each had a unique ethnic style and were warmly welcomed by the audience. Many of these programs were created by people of all ethnic groups in labor or combat. Some ethnic performance programs have a very broad mass base. A performance program called "A Li Li Ge" has simple and concise movements and is a beautiful dance that almost everyone in the Naxi ethnic group knows. Some programs had been lost and could only be performed by a few old people, but they were unearthed this time. Li Lao San, a seventy-three-year-old Kawa athlete, traveled a long way to Dali to personally perform the wonderful "Pigeon Dance," which imitates the actions of pigeons pecking food, walking, and jumping, in order to ensure that it is passed down forever.
　　Through the performance competition, understanding among ethnic groups in terms of thought, emotion, and culture was enhanced. When Tibetan athletes La Jia and Ben Ma saw the Dai ethnic group's "Peacock Dance" for the first time, they excitedly said to the Dai athletes, "This performance is extremely beautiful! If it weren't for performing together this time, how could the programs of our ethnic groups have met?"

　　云南西部地区的民族体育表演比赛
　　帅仁
    四月里，云南西部地区各族人民，在大理县举行了民族体育表演比赛大会。参加表演比赛的二百多名运动员，包括傣、景颇、卡瓦、阿昌、民家、纳西、藏、汉等二十多种民族。他们中有七十三岁的白发老人，也有年只十二岁的少年儿童；有生产模范，也有民间艺人。
    表演比赛的节目，反映了民族形式体育的丰富多采。全部表演比赛和特邀表演的民族舞蹈、民间体育、武术、赛马、马术、射弩、火枪、打弹弓和摔跤等九十多个节目，都各有独特的民族风格，受到观众的热烈欢迎。其中许多节目，是各族人民在劳动中或战斗中创造的。有些民族的表演节目，群众基础非常广泛。一个叫做“阿利礼歌”的表演节目，动作纯朴而简练，几乎是纳西族人人都会的一个优美的舞蹈。有的节目，已将失传，只有个别老人才会表演，这次发掘出来了。七十三岁的卡瓦族运动员李老三，为使模仿斑鸠啄食、走路、跳跃等动作的“斑鸠舞”永远相传，这次他特别远道赶到大理，亲自表演了这个美妙的节目。
    通过表演比赛大会，增进了各民族之间在思想、感情和文化上的了解。藏族运动员拉加和本马第一次看到了傣族的“孔雀舞”时，兴奋地对傣族运动员说：“这项表演，美丽极了！不是这次在一起表演，我们民族间的节目哪能相见？”
