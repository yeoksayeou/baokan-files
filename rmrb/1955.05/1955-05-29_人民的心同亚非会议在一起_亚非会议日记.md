　　The Hearts of the People Are With the Asian-African Conference

　　The Voice of the Chinese People
　　Tuesday, April 19th

　　In addition to those who spoke yesterday, almost all heads of delegations will speak at today's meeting. Their speeches will determine the direction the conference will take.

　　The order of speeches by each delegation is generally arranged according to the first letter of each country's name in English. On the announcement board in the press room, the People's Republic of China is listed first on the list of delegations scheduled to speak today.

　　After the Iraqi representative spoke yesterday, today, in the press room, and even in the headlines of the morning newspapers, a question was being asked everywhere: "What will the Chinese delegation say?"

　　All kinds of speculations are circulating.

　　Those American reporters who were already "working hard" at their typewriters before the meeting even started are busy sending out the following "news": "The Asian-African Conference will encounter difficulties today," "Zhou Enlai will refute Jamali today."…

　　Perhaps they are rejoicing too early; perhaps...

　　The voice of the Chinese people is destined to be the center of attention at today's meeting.

　　The morning session began at 9:15.

　　The first item was the announcement by the Secretary-General of the conference that it had received many congratulatory telegrams, one of which was from Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

　　Some eyes turned to the American Congressman Powell, who was wearing a reporter's badge and sitting in the visitor's gallery. It was reported that this congressman had asked US President Eisenhower to send a congratulatory message to the Asian-African Conference. However, the US State Department gave him a reply last Friday: "We do not believe that the US government's relationship with the Bandung Conference is worthy of sending such a congratulatory message." At that time, it was said that Powell was so angry that he cursed: the US government had committed a foolish act in diplomacy. Now, this congressman is sitting there blankly with no expression.

　　Then, the heads of delegations began to speak. Those who spoke at this morning's meeting were: Deresa of Ethiopia, Takasaki Tatsunosuke of Japan, Walid Salah of Jordan, Kote of Laos, Sami Solh of Lebanon, Momolu Dukuly of Liberia, Mahmoud Muntasser of Libya, Thapa of Nepal, Muhammad Ali of Pakistan, Romulo of the Philippines, and Ismail al-Azhari of Sudan.

　　Listening carefully, the vast majority of speakers mentioned their desire for peace, their desire for friendship, and their hatred of colonialism.

　　The circumstances of the Asian-African countries are similar; after all, their voices cannot but be similar.

　　But it is true that not everyone joined the chorus like Jamali. For example, Romulo of the Philippines did. He cannot deny the fact that the Philippines was once a colony of the United States, but he tried his best to praise the United States for its "good credit" to the Philippines. In his long speech, the main part was to describe according to his own imagination, and then to slander communism according to his own wishes. In his opinion, the current task of the Asian-African people is not to fight colonialism to achieve independence, but to unite with imperialist countries like the United States against communism.

　　The atmosphere of the meeting became even more tense after Romulo's speech.

　　The Chinese delegation did not speak in the morning. On the blackboard announcement in the press room, the names of the countries that had already spoken were erased, and China is now ranked first among those scheduled to speak at the afternoon meeting.

　　People's moods were as anxious as the midday sun on the equator, waiting, waiting to hear the voice of the Chinese people.

　　At about two o'clock in the afternoon, a tropical downpour suddenly struck. For those of us from northern China, this is a rare experience. The clear sky was instantly filled with dark clouds, the wind roared, and the rain poured down as if from an overturned bucket. Palm leaves a foot long were knocked down one by one, and the ditches next to the road were suddenly filled with rushing currents. We were anxious to get to the meeting place, but the rain on the car window blurred the road.

　　Finally, at nearly three o'clock, we finally arrived at Independence Hall. But, look, the crowds on Asian-African Street were already packed, and the wind and rain did not diminish their enthusiasm in the slightest.

　　The rain gradually subsided, and more and more people gathered. Everyone knew that Premier Zhou Enlai, the head of the People's Republic of China delegation, would speak this afternoon.

　　Just after three o'clock, a car with a five-star red flag, followed by wailing police cars, arrived. The masses on both sides immediately jumped up, braved the rain, stepped through the accumulated water, and surged to the center of the street like a landslide to cheer Premier Zhou.

　　The afternoon meeting then began. The first speaker was Azem of Syria, followed by Prince Naradhip of Thailand and Zoru of Turkey.

　　Azem emphasized: Peaceful coexistence must become "the fundamental basis of our international life... In order to achieve peace, all the remaining foundations of imperialism should be eliminated." However, Prince Naradhip's attitude was different. He said that he did not oppose the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but he had "doubts and worries" about the last one, "peaceful coexistence," because in his opinion, the Dai Autonomous Region established by China made "Thailand have to face the threat of infiltration and subversion activities." As for Zoru, he did not mention "peaceful coexistence" at all, but insisted that military groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization were for peace. When Prince Naradhip and Zoru spoke, many people looked at the seats of the Chinese delegation from time to time. People saw Zhou Enlai writing something rapidly on his speech draft.

　　Almost everyone who signed up to speak had finished speaking. The chairman announced: "I now invite the representative of the People's Republic of China to speak."

　　Suddenly, a storm of applause that had never been seen before erupted in the venue. Looking around the venue, every seat was now filled, and the places without seats were also filled with people standing. When Zhou Enlai walked to the podium, the mercury lamps lit up together, and the cameras moved together. No one was unaware of the importance of this moment.

　　Zhou Enlai first stated that he would print and distribute his speech to everyone and would no longer read it out. However, after listening to the speeches of many heads of delegations, he was willing to add a few words.

　　Not only reporters, not only representatives, but even some diplomats in the visitor's gallery took out their notebooks.

　　Zhou Enlai began: "The Chinese delegation is here to seek unity, not to quarrel." From here on, people felt that the atmosphere of the meeting had changed abruptly. Then, Zhou Enlai said: "We communists never conceal that we believe in communism and think that the socialist system is good. However, there is no need to promote individual ideologies and political systems of various countries at this meeting."

　　"The Chinese delegation is here to seek common ground, not to create differences." Zhou Enlai continued: "Is there a basis for seeking common ground among us? Yes. That is, the vast majority of Asian and African countries and peoples have suffered and are still suffering from the disasters and pains caused by colonialism since modern times. This is what we all acknowledge. From removing the pain and disasters of colonialism to find a common basis, we can easily understand and respect each other, sympathize and support each other, rather than doubt and fear each other, exclude and oppose each other."

　　More and more people came into the venue. Many of the people on the outermost edge stood on chairs, looking at Zhou Enlai.

　　Zhou Enlai continued: "We agree with the four objectives announced by the five-country prime ministers at the Bogor Conference regarding the Asian-African Conference, and we will not make any other suggestions." Zhou Enlai also said: Originally, the Chinese delegation could have proposed that the conference discuss the issue of the tense situation in the Taiwan region created by the United States single-handedly, and could also have proposed that the conference discuss the issue of recognizing and restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. But the Chinese delegation did not do so because it did not want the conference to fall into debate over these issues and fail to find a solution.

　　For two days, it could often be felt that a hand wanted to drag the meeting in another direction. Now, another more powerful hand gently pushed it away.

　　The audience was silent, listening quietly to Zhou Enlai continuing: "Our meeting should seek common ground while reserving differences. At the same time, the meeting should affirm these common wishes and demands... We do not require everyone to give up their own opinions, because this is a reflection of reality. But it should not prevent us from reaching a common agreement on major issues."

　　Someone in the audience nodded.

　　Then, Zhou Enlai talked about some of the issues that had been raised at the meeting in the past two days. First, he talked about different ideologies and social systems being able to coexist peacefully. Second, he talked about people with religious beliefs and people without religious beliefs should respect each other. Third, he talked about China having no intention of subverting neighboring governments, but is suffering from the harm of being subverted by the US government openly. Finally, Zhou Enlai said:

　　"We allow people who do not know the truth to doubt. A Chinese proverb says: ‘Seeing is believing.’ We welcome all representatives attending the meeting to visit China, and you can go anytime. We don’t have a bamboo curtain, but others want to release a smokescreen between us.”

　　This is China's attitude, its attitude towards all doubts and even slanders. Listening to these words, it seems that the distance between people and the distance between hearts are shortening.

　　In order to save time, Zhou Enlai's speech, except for the first paragraph, was read out in English by the interpreter. Finally, Zhou Enlai personally said in a loud voice: "The 1.6 billion Asian and African people are looking forward to the success of our meeting. Countries and people all over the world who desire peace are looking forward to our meeting making a contribution to expanding the area of peace and establishing collective peace. Let us Asian and African countries unite and work hard for the success of the Asian-African Conference!"

　　The whole audience once again responded to this speech, which represented the wishes of 600 million Chinese people, with lasting applause. When Zhou Enlai walked down from the podium, countless reporters rushed out of the venue in a hurry. There is no doubt that this is the most important development of the conference so far, and it must be sent out by all means and in the fastest way.

　　Zhou Enlai returned to his seat. Representatives from other countries came over to shake hands with him.

　　The next speaker after Zhou Enlai was Nguyen Van Thuy of South Vietnam. Most people in the press gallery did not hear what he was saying.

　　Not long after, the chairman announced the adjournment of the conference, and closed-door meetings of heads of delegations would begin tomorrow.

　　When Zhou Enlai walked out of Independence Hall, the surrounding crowds gathered again and surrounded him.

　　Zhou Enlai stood in the center of the crowd, smiling and raising his right hand.

　　Many reporters rushed to inquire about the reactions of various delegations to the speech of the head of the Chinese delegation.

　　Indian Prime Minister Nehru said: "This is a very good speech."

　　Burmese Prime Minister U Nu said that the speech was "a good answer to those who criticized China."

　　Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser said: "He wanted to answer our questions about him yesterday. I liked his speech."

　　Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali said: "This is a very conciliatory speech."

　　Even Romulo of the Philippines said: "This speech is excellent, conciliatory, and demonstrates a democratic spirit." For people who have experienced the various changes in the climate at the Asian-African Conference from yesterday to today, the speech of the head of the Chinese delegation today has dispelled the dark clouds that have gathered at the meeting for two days. It pointed out a direction for the conference, enabling it to resist the attempt to drag it into opposition and quarrel, and to bypass the hidden reefs ahead and achieve its goals.

　　In addition, it also enabled the other twenty-eight countries participating in the meeting and the entire world to further understand New China, to understand its humility, its sincerity, its goodwill, and its sincere desire for peace.

　　Perhaps only history can accurately estimate the breadth and depth of the impact of this speech by the delegation of the People's Republic of China. But, even tonight, it has at least firmly given people confidence and hope for tomorrow. (To be continued)

　　人民的心同亚非会议在一起
　　——亚非会议日记
　　李慎之　张彦
　　  （续昨）
　  中国人民的声音
　　四月十九日星期二
　　除了昨天已经发过言的以外，几乎所有的代表团团长都要在今天的会议上发言。他们的发言将决定会议向什么方向发展。
    各国代表团发言的次序大体是按照各个国家国名的第一个英文字母的次序排列的。在记者室里黑板上的公告上，中华人民共和国列在今天预定要发言的代表团的名单的头一个。
    在昨天伊拉克代表发言以后，今天，在记者室里，甚至在早报的标题上，到处都在提出一个问题：“中国代表团要讲些什么？”
    各种各样的猜测在流传着。
    那些会议还没有开始就已经伏在打字机上“紧张工作”的美国记者们，正在忙着把下面的“消息”发出去：“亚非会议将在今天碰到难关”，“周恩来将在今天驳斥贾马利。”……。
    也许，他们高兴得太早了；也许……。
    中国人民的声音注定是今天会议上注意的中心。
    上午会议在九点十五分开始了。
    第一个节目是会议秘书长宣布会议收到了许多贺电，其中有一个是苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫的贺电。
    有人的眼光转到了挂着记者徽章坐在来宾席上的美国议员鲍威尔身上。有消息说，这位议员曾经要求美国总统艾森豪威尔向亚非会议送一个贺辞。但是美国国务院在上星期五给了他一个答复：“我们并不认为美国政府同万隆会议的关系是值得向会议送这样的贺辞的”。当时，据说，鲍威尔曾气得恨恨地骂：美国政府在外交上做了一桩愚蠢的行为。现在，这位议员先生呆呆地坐在那里没有什么表情。
    接着，各国代表团团长开始发言。在今天上午会议上发言的有：埃塞俄比亚的德雷萨，日本的高碕达之助，约旦的华利德·萨拉，老挝的克特，黎巴嫩的萨米·索勒哈，利比里亚的摩莫卢·杜库利，利比亚的马茂德·蒙塔塞尔，尼泊尔的塔帕，巴基斯坦的穆罕默德·阿里，菲律宾的罗慕洛，苏丹的伊斯梅尔·阿扎里。
    仔细听来，绝大部分的发言者都提到了对和平的愿望，对友好的愿望，对殖民主义的憎恨。
    亚非国家的境遇是相似的，毕竟，它们的呼声也不能不是相似的。
    但是，也确实不是没有人加入了贾马利那样的合唱队，例如，菲律宾的罗慕洛就是。他并不能抹煞菲律宾曾是美国的殖民地的事实，但是他却竭力地赞扬美国对菲律宾是“良好的信用”。在他那冗长的发言中，主要的部分是按照他自己的想像来描写，然后又按照自己的愿望来诽谤共产主义。在他看来，亚非人民当前的任务不是去向殖民主义斗争以取得独立，而是要同像美国那样的帝国主义国家联合起来反对共产主义。
    会议的空气在罗慕洛发言以后是更加紧张了。
    中国代表团上午没有发言。在记者室的黑板公告上，擦去了已经发过言的国家的名字，中国现在排在预定要在下午会议上发言的头一个。
    人们的心情像赤道上中午的太阳一样焦灼地在等待，等待着听中国人民的声音。
    大约午后两点钟的时候，突然袭来了一场热带的豪雨。对于我们这些从北中国来的人，这是一种稀有的经验。晴朗的天空顷刻间就布满了乌云，狂风怒卷，雨水像是从倒提着的水桶里那样泼下来。丈把长的棕榈叶子被打得一株一株往下掉，马路旁的水沟一下子都灌满了湍湍急流。我们急着要赶到会场去，但是车窗上的雨水流得连路都认不清。
    好容易，在将近三点钟的时候，总算赶到了独立大厦。但是，看啊，亚非大街上的人群却早已挤得满满的了，狂风暴雨，并不能丝毫降低他们的热情。
    雨渐渐小了，人越来越多了，大家都知道了：中华人民共和国代表团团长周恩来总理要在今天下午发言。
    三点刚过，挂着五星红旗的汽车随着呼啸着的警车到来了。两边的群众立刻跳起来，冒着雨，踏着积水，排山倒海似地涌到街心，向周总理欢呼。
    下午会议接着就开始。首先发言的是叙利亚的阿泽姆，接着是泰国的那拉底亲王和土耳其的佐鲁。
    阿泽姆强调：和平共处必须成为“我们国际生活的根本基础。……为了实现和平，应该消灭帝国主义的所有残余基础”。但是，那拉底亲王的态度就不同了。他表示他不反对五项共处原则，但是对最后一项“和平共处”心中有“怀疑和忧虑”，因为在他看来，中国所建立的傣族自治区使“泰国不得不面对渗入和颠覆活动的威胁”。至于佐鲁，他根本没有提到“和平共处”，反而硬说北大西洋条约组织和东南亚条约组织这样的军事集团是为了和平。在那拉底亲王和佐鲁发言的时候，有许多人不时望一望中国代表团的席位。人们看见周恩来正在急速地在他的发言稿上写什么。
    差不多一切报名发言的人都讲完了。主席宣布：“我现在请中华人民共和国的代表发言”。
    突然，会场里爆发了一场从来没有的暴风雨似的掌声。环顾全场，每一个座位现在都坐满了人，没有座位的地方也站满了人。当周恩来走上讲坛的时候，水银灯一齐亮起来，照相机一齐动起来。没有人不意识到这一刻的重要。
    周恩来首先声明要把他的发言稿印发给大家，不再宣读了。但是在听了许多代表团团长的发言之后，愿意补充说几句话。
    不但是记者，不但是代表，而且连来宾席上的有些外交官们也掏出了笔记本。
    周恩来开始了：“中国代表团是来求团结而不是来吵架的。”从这里起，人们感到会上的空气陡然变了。然后，周恩来说：“我们共产党人从不讳言我们相信共产主义和认为社会主义制度是好的。但是，在这个会议上用不着来宣传个人的思想意识和各国的政治制度”。
      “中国代表团是来求同而不是来立异的。”周恩来继续说：“在我们中间有无求同的基础呢？有的。那就是亚非绝大多数国家和人民自近代以来都曾经受过、而且现在仍在受着殖民主义所造成的灾难和痛苦。这是我们大家都承认的。从解除殖民主义痛苦和灾难中找共同基础，我们就很容易互相了解和尊重、互相同情和支持，而不是互相疑虑和恐惧，互相排斥和对立。”
    进会场来的人越来越多了。最靠边的人许多站在椅子上，望着周恩来。
    周恩来接着说：“我们同意五国总理茂物会议所宣布的关于亚非会议的四项目的，而不另提建议。”周恩来又说：本来中国代表团很可以提议会议讨论美国一手造成的台湾地区紧张局势的问题，也很可以提议会议讨论承认和恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的问题。但是中国代表团没有这样做，因为它不想使会议陷入对这些问题的争论而得不到解决。
    两天以来，时常可以感到有一只手想把会议拖向另外一个方向跑，现在，另外一只更强有力的手把它轻轻地推开了。
    全场鸦雀无声，大家静听周恩来讲下去：“我们的会议应该求同而存异。同时，会议应将这些共同愿望和要求肯定下来。……我们并不要求各人放弃自己的见解，因为这是实际存在的反映。但是不应该使它妨碍我们在主要问题上达成共同的协议。”
    会场上有人在点头。
    接着，周恩来谈到了两天来会议上有人提出了的一些问题。首先他谈到不同的思想意识和社会制度可以和平共处。其次他谈到有宗教信仰和没有宗教信仰的人应该相互尊重。第三，他谈到中国决无颠覆邻邦政府的意图，倒是正在受到美国政府公言不讳地进行颠覆活动的害处。最后，周恩来说：
  “我们是容许不知真相的人怀疑的。中国俗语说： ‘百闻不如一见。’我们欢迎所有到会的各国代表到中国去参观，你们什么时候去都可以。我们没有竹幕，倒是别人要在我们之间施放烟幕。”
    这就是中国的态度，它对一切怀疑，以至诽谤的态度。听着这些话，似乎人与人之间的距离，心与心之间的距离都在缩短。
    为了节省时间，周恩来的发言，除了第一段之外都是由译员以英文宣读的。最后，周恩来亲自用宏亮的声音说：“十六万万的亚非人民期待着我们的会议成功。全世界愿意和平的国家和人民期待着我们的会议能为扩大和平区域和建立集体和平有所贡献。让我们亚非国家团结起来、为亚非会议的成功努力吧！”
    全场再次以经久不息的掌声来回答这个代表着六亿中国人民的意愿的发言。当周恩来从讲台上走下来的时候，无数的记者也就急急忙忙冲出了会场。毫无疑问，这是会议迄今最重大的发展，一定要以一切途径，以最快的方法发出去。
    周恩来回到了自己的座位上。有别的国家的代表过来同他握手。
    在周恩来之后发言的是南越代表阮文瑞。记者席上大部分人都没有听见他在讲什么。
    没有多久以后，主席宣布大会休会，明天起开始举行不公开的代表团团长会议。
    当周恩来走出独立大厦的时候，四围的群众再度聚拢过来，把他包围起来。
    周恩来站在人群的中央，微笑着，举起了右手。
    许多记者急急忙忙去向各国代表团打听对中国代表团团长的演说的反应。
    印度总理尼赫鲁说：“这是一个很好的演说”。
    缅甸总理吴努说：这个演说是“对抨击中国的人一个很好的答复。”
    埃及总理纳赛尔说：“他是想答复我们昨天所说的关于他的问题。我喜欢他的演说。”
    巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里说：“这是很和解的演说。”
    就是菲律宾的罗慕洛也说：“这个演说是出色的，和解的，表现了民主精神。”对于经历了昨天到今天亚非会议上气候的各种变化的人们说来，中国代表团团长今天的发言已经驱散了两天来在会议上集合起来的乌云。它给会议指出了一个方向，使它能够抵抗那种想把它拖入对立和争吵的企图，能够绕过前途的暗礁而达到自己的目的。
    另外，它也使与会的其他二十八国以及整个世界都更进一步认识了新中国，认识了它的谦逊，它的诚恳，它的善意和它对和平的真诚愿望。
    也许只有历史才能确切地估计中华人民共和国代表团这个发言的影响的广度和深度。但是，即使是在今天晚上，它至少已经确定不移地给予了人们对明天的信心和希望。（待续）
