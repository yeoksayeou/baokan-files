　　Song Jingui Model Group
    In 1954, the Song Jingui Model Group of the Taiyuan 203 Construction Site successively overfulfilled its tasks nine times, exceeding the quota by an average of 38 percent. The engineering quality of this group fully met the specifications. There were no equipment or personal accidents throughout the year, and the average attendance rate was over 98 percent. Furthermore, it saved raw materials worth more than 41,700 yuan. When the Second Construction Engineering Company of the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering selected labor models in 1954, the Song Jingui Group was rated as an A-level model group.
    The first experience of the Song Jingui Model Group in ensuring the comprehensive completion of tasks is to strengthen the planning of group production and establish a normal construction order. Whenever team leader Song Jingui receives an engineering task sheet from the foreman or accepts a task at a workshop meeting, he always first consults with the trade union leader and several experienced technical workers. These people first clarify the drawings and prepare a preliminary plan; then they convene a production meeting of the whole group. The construction team leader announces the engineering task sheet and explains the indicators of each task in detail. Then, all the workers in the group discuss the tasks by work process, review the previous work, and formulate specific guarantee conditions and measures for completing the next stage of work. After the group plan is approved, the construction team leader and the trade union leader jointly draw up an engineering progress chart, using red and blue lines to indicate the daily engineering progress. The team leader also arranges the work for the workers in each process for the next day according to the progress situation that evening.
    The second experience is to give full play to the wisdom of all team members, strive to improve tools and operating methods, and promote advanced experience to improve work efficiency. For example, in the past, when prefabricating models, it was necessary to first nail the nails on the table, use the nails to hold the band on the table, and then nail the model, which was both time-consuming and troublesome. Later, they studied and improved the operating procedures, and added rulers and nail slots, which reduced the time for measuring and nailing, and increased work efficiency by more than double. They also studied and improved a kind of gauge, which increased the efficiency of planing edges by more than 50 percent and guaranteed the specifications of the products. In addition, they changed the method of managing beam molds with iron rods to managing beam molds with nails, which increased work efficiency by more than two times.
    The third experience is to rationally use technical forces and implement assembly line operations according to the construction characteristics and equipment conditions. They divided the entire project into four processes: flat-mouth jointing, prefabrication, installation, and demolition. Each process was further divided into several items according to the actual situation. The labor force responsible for each process and item was allocated according to the labor quota in North China. The personnel in each position were fixed according to the simplicity or complexity of the work and the technical level. If the personnel for some engineering projects could not be completely fixed, they would be temporarily transferred by the team leader. In this way, the sense of responsibility of each member was strengthened, and the enthusiasm and technical ability of everyone was brought into play, overcoming the confusion and ensuring the quality. In addition, they also paid great attention to mutual cooperation and connection with other projects.

　　先进经验和先进生产者
　　宋金贵模型小组
    太原二○三工地宋金贵模型小组在一九五四年施工中接连九次超额完成任务，平均超过定额百分之三十八。这个小组的工程质量完全合乎规格，全年没有发生过任何设备和人身事故，出勤率平均在百分之九十八以上，并且节省了价值四万一千七百多元的原材料。一九五四年建筑工程部太原工程局第二建筑工程公司评选劳动模范时，宋金贵小组被评为甲等模范小组。
    宋金贵模型小组保证全面完成任务的第一条经验是加强小组生产的计划性，建立正常的施工秩序。组长宋金贵每逢接到工长发来的工程任务单或在工段会议上接受任务后，总是先找工会组长和几位老技术工人共同研究。他们几个人先弄清图纸，并拟出初步计划；然后召开全组生产会议，由施工组长宣布工程任务单，详细交代每项任务的指标；然后全组工人分开工序进行讨论，检查前一段工作，订出完成下一段工作的具体保证条件和措施。小组计划通过后，由施工组长和工会组长共同绘制出工程进度指示图表，把每天的工程进度用红线和蓝线表示出来，组长并根据进度情况在当天晚上给各工序的工人布置第二天的工作。
    第二条经验是发挥全体组员的智慧，努力改进工具和操作方法，推广先进经验，以提高工作效率。例如过去预制模型时要先在案上钉好钉子，用钉子把带卡在案上，然后才钉模型，既费工又麻烦。后来他们研究改进了操作规程，又增添了尺样和放钉槽，减少了量尺寸和放钉的时间，使工作效率提高了一倍多。他们又研究改进了一种标尺，使刨边的效率提高了百分之五十以上，并保证了产品的规格。又把用铁棍管梁模的方法改成用钉子管梁模，提高了工作效率两倍多。
    第三条经验是合理使用技术力量，根据施工特点和设备情况，实行流水作业。他们把全部工程分为平口对缝、预制、安装、拆除四个工序，每个工序又按实际情况分为若干项目。担负每个工序和项目的劳动力，都是根据华北地区的劳动定额来配备的。每个岗位上的人员，都根据工作的简繁和技术等级固定起来。有些工程项目的人员不能完全固定，就由组长临时调动。这样，就加强了每个成员的工作责任感，发挥了大家的积极性和技术能力，克服了混乱现象，保证了质量。此外，他们还很注意同其他工程互相配合和联系。
