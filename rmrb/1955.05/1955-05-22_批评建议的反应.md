Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

Those who Persecuted Tang Shiwu Have Been Disciplined

　　The People's Daily published a letter from a reader on November 21, 1954, concerning the persecution and exclusion of Tang Shiwu, a technician at the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Mining and Industrial Research. After a joint investigation by the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the People's Supervision Commission of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, and the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and after verification from various sources, it was proven that the facts revealed by the reader were essentially true. (However, the claims that the former director, Li Yifu, refused to approve technician Tang Shiwu's three proposals to develop a polarograph; that he held three meetings to "rectify" Tang Shiwu's "ideology"; and that "later acting director Wang Shunli shelved the 3 million yuan bonus and a certificate of merit that the Industry Department intended to give Tang Shiwu" were inconsistent with the facts.)

　　The investigation report confirmed that Tang Shiwu trial-produced seven instruments, improved five instruments, and proposed several rationalization suggestions during his two years and three months at the Institute of Mining and Industrial Research; his work was consistently active. However, Tang Shiwu's creative labor was met with jealousy and attacks from some conservative and backward elements, including technicians Xuan Tang, Zeng San, and Wang Anren, as well as Party and Youth League members Fan Naiwang and Li Zhibin. They engaged in small-group activities, excluding and attacking Tang Shiwu, and leading cadres Li Yifu and Wang Shunli of the Institute of Mining and Industrial Research actually listened to the backward elements such as Xuan Tang and adopted a discriminatory attitude towards Tang Shiwu.

　　The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that Li Yifu's mistake was caused by his serious bureaucratism, subjectivism, and a certain degree of personal emotions. Therefore, it was decided to give Li Yifu a public warning. Wang Shunli, in resolving the problems of the Institute of Mining and Industrial Research, not only failed to implement the instructions of his superiors but also abandoned Party principles under the dominance of bourgeois individualism to enhance his personal prestige, excluding Tang Shiwu and causing great losses to the work. It was decided to remove him from his position as secretary of the general Party branch. Fan Naiwang, the secretary of the Youth League branch (alternate member of the Communist Party), participated in small-group activities, relied on his authority to protect bad people and deeds, and suppressed criticism, which did not meet the basic requirements of a Communist Party member. It was decided to revoke his qualifications as an alternate Party member.

　　Xuan Tang, who played a leading role in the small-group activities that attacked Tang Shiwu, disregarded national interests, deliberately reduced and obliterated Tang Shiwu's work achievements, and even resorted to conspiracy and framing. His mistakes were extremely serious, but he has not yet seriously examined his mistakes. It was decided to give him an administrative demotion. In addition, Li Zhibin, Wang Anren, Zeng San, and others who participated in Xuan Tang's small group were given administrative demerits and disciplinary punishments by the Youth League.

　　The Central-South Hydroelectric Power Engineering Bureau Examines its Mistake of Refusing to Employ Demobilized Soldiers

　　The Central-South Hydroelectric Power Engineering Bureau writes: After reading the People's Daily's criticism on April 3rd of our refusal to employ demobilized soldiers, we adopted a serious attitude and convened a series of meetings from the inside out, from top to bottom, to conduct an examination. The administrative leadership personally presided over a symposium for transferred and demobilized military cadres, listened to their criticisms, and instructed Comrade Guo Rongyi to make a self-criticism.

　　The nature of this mistake is serious. It not only violates the policies of the Party and the government but also has a very bad impact on the implementation of the compulsory military service system and is detrimental to the cause of national defense construction. The reason for the mistake is mainly that we have not studied and researched the central government's instructions on properly resettling demobilized soldiers and prioritizing their employment sufficiently. Our policy viewpoints are not clear, and we lack a comprehensive perspective. When sending Comrade Guo Rongyi to Changde Prefecture for recruitment, we did not explain the policy of prioritizing the employment of demobilized soldiers, which led to Guo's "refusal under pretext." From Guo Rongyi's perspective, it was due to a low policy level, insufficient understanding of the current new situation, subjective and one-sided thinking methods, and a lack of a strong sense of responsibility in his work. Through this examination, we have found that our organization still has some shortcomings in dealing with the work of transferred and demobilized military cadres, insufficient assistance to transferred military cadres, and improper use of individual transferred comrades. Based on these circumstances, we have decided to improve future work by focusing on three aspects: leadership style and working methods, establishing a sound system of layered responsibility for cadre management, and strengthening the Party's ideological work.

　　Regarding the mistakes made by Comrade Guo Rongyi, because her self-criticism was relatively profound, it was decided to give her an administrative demerit, and a report was submitted to the Central Hydroelectric Construction Bureau for approval and implementation.

　　Further Correct Business Ideology

　　The Jianxiang Machinery Factory in Hengyang City writes: The People's Daily's criticism of our factory on April 10th is correct. From September of last year to March of this year, the factory worked a total of more than 1,400 overtime workdays.
  “Voluntary overtime” has no records available.

　　The reason for this situation is: our understanding of the tasks of local state-owned factories is not clear, we blindly pursue the manufacture of high-end products, detached from our own equipment conditions and technical level; when the production plan cannot be completed, we disregard labor policies and allow workers to work overtime. What is particularly serious is that our mistake was already criticized in a circular by the Industry Department of the Hengyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in November of last year, but we ignored it and continued as before. Although the phenomenon of overtime has been basically overcome, we must further correct our business ideology, improve enterprise management, and rely on employees to do a good job.

专栏：批评建议的反应

　　批评建议的反应
    打击唐世五的人已经受到处分
    一九五四年十一月二十一日本报读者来信专页发表山西省工矿研究所技术员唐世五遭到打击和排挤的事件。这一事件经过中共山西省委纪律检查委员会、山西省人民政府人民监察委员会、新民主主义青年团山西省委员会联合检查，多方对证，证明读者所揭发的事实基本上是真实的。（其中关于前任所长李一夫拒绝批准技术员唐世五提出试制极谱仪的三次计划；并先后召开三次会来“整”唐世五的“思想”，以及“后来代理所长王顺理，对工业厅准备给唐世五的三百万元奖金和一张奖状搁置不办”与事实不符。）
    检查报告证明：唐世五在工矿研究所的两年零三个月中试制了七种仪器、改进了五种仪器，并提出合理化建议若干件；工作始终是积极的。但是，唐世五的这种创造性的劳动，却遭到一部分保守落后分子的嫉妒和打击，这就是以宣唐为首的曾三、王安仁等技术员，和党、团员范迺旺、李质彬等。他们进行小集团活动，排斥和打击唐世五，而工矿研究所的领导干部李一夫、王顺理等居然听信了落后分子宣唐等人，对唐世五采取了歧视的态度。
    中共山西省委纪律检查委员会认为李一夫的错误是由于他的严重的官僚主义、主观主义和某种程度上的个人情绪所造成。为此，决定给李一夫以当众警告的处分。王顺理在解决工矿研究所的问题时，不但没有执行上级指示，反而在资产阶级个人主义思想支配下为了提高个人威信，放弃了党的原则，将唐世五排挤出去，给工作造成很大的损失，决定给予撤销他的总支委员工作的处分。青年团支部书记（中共候补党员）范迺旺参加小集团活动，依仗职权，包庇坏人坏事，压制批评，不够一个共产党员的起码条件，决定取消他的候补党员资格。
    在打击唐世五的小集团活动上起主导作用的宣唐，不顾国家利益，故意降低和抹煞唐世五的工作成绩、甚至采取阴谋陷害的手段，错误极其严重，但是到现在他还不认真检讨错误，行政上决定给他以撤职处分。另外，参加宣唐小集团的李质彬、王安仁、曾三等人分别受到行政上记过和青年团的纪律处分。
　　中南水力发电工程局检查拒用复员军人的错误
    中南水力发电工程局来信：看了四月三日人民日报读者对我们拒绝录用复员军人的批评以后，我们采取了严肃认真的态度，从内到外，从上到下召开了一系列的会议进行检查。行政领导方面亲自主持召开转业和复员军人干部座谈会，听取他们的批评，并责成郭容仪同志作了检讨。
    这次错误性质是严重的，不但违背了党和政府的政策，而且对义务兵役制的推行造成极坏的影响，对国防建设事业也是不利的。造成错误的原因，主要是我们对中央妥善安置复员军人和优先就业指示学习研究不够，政策观点不明确，缺乏全面观念。在派郭容仪同志去常德专区招考时，没有交代优先录用复员军人的政策，以致有郭“借词拒绝”的情事发生。从郭容仪本人来说，则是由于政策水平低，对当前新的形势认识不足，思想方法主观片面，工作上责任心不强。通过这次检查，发现了我们机关对待转业和复员军人干部工作上还有若干缺点，对军队转业干部帮助不够，并且对个别转业的同志还有使用不当的现象。根据这些情况，我们决定要从领导作风和工作方法，健全干部管理分层负责制，加强党的思想工作等三个方面着手改进今后工作。
    对郭容仪同志所犯的错误，因为她检讨比较深刻，行政上决定给予记过处分，并呈报中央水电建设总局批准执行。
    要进一步端正经营思想
    衡阳市建湘机械厂来信：四月十日人民日报读者对我厂的批评是正确的。从去年九月到今年三月，全厂加班加点工时共计一千四百多个工作日，
  “义务加班”尚无记录可查。
    造成这种情况的原因是：我们对地方国营工厂的任务认识不明确，脱离自己的设备条件和技术水平盲目地追求制造高级产品；当生产计划不能完成的时候，又不顾劳动政策，让工人加班加点。特别严重的是，我们这种错误在去年十一月已经受到中共衡阳市委工业部通报批评，但我们却置之不理，依然如故。目前加班加点现象虽然已经基本上克服了，但是我们还要进一步端正经营思想，搞好企业管理，依靠职工，搞好工作。
