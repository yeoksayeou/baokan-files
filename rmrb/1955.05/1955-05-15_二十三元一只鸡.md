Twenty-Three Yuan Per Chicken
To the Editor:

　　In the late spring and early summer of 1954, Weijiazhuang Village in Lin County, Henan Province, suddenly became lively. Farmers, cadres, and students, in groups of three and five, came to visit the Weijiazhuang Chicken Farm. On this exciting occasion, the leader who came up with the idea to build this chicken farm must have been extremely happy! Wherever he went, he would boast, "This is a true example for the people in the mountainous areas!"

　　Unexpectedly, after a few days, the chicks began to die. Wei Baolin, the chicken farm manager, got up before dawn and went down the mountain to report to the district party secretary: the chicks were not growing after they were bought. Technician Xiao Jingsheng suggested feeding them some salt. Who knew that after the chicks ate the salt, more than a hundred of them died the next day. Then, on the third and fourth days, more and more died each day, and now more than two thousand have died.

　　The manager seemed to have some complaints when he said: When the chicken farm was just established, our agricultural producers' cooperative had proposed that we lacked technology and didn't know how to raise chickens, but the leadership repeatedly said that we were a key cooperative and must take the lead in setting an example. If we didn't have money, the state could provide loans; if we didn't have technology, the county's technical guidance station could send people to guide us. This time, technician Xiao Jingsheng fed them salt based on scientific research. At the time, none of us agreed with technician Xiao doing this, but who dares to disbelieve science?

　　The district party secretary was of course very angry after hearing the manager's report. He got up, dressed while still in bed, and without even washing his face, went to the chicken farm with the manager, severely reprimanded technician Xiao Jingsheng, showed off his authority, and then left.

　　Three days later, the death of the chicks improved slightly. People felt a bit more at ease: "Amitabha, they mustn't die anymore!" But five days later, just as people were eating breakfast, hey! The chicks started dying again! The chicken farm was lit up all night, and the eight feeders watched helplessly as the chicks died one by one. The technician could no longer use his skills. They had no choice but to record the number of deaths in the books, ready to announce the accounts to the cooperative members.

　　Seeing that the chicks were about to die out, the cooperative members had many opinions. The feeders were discouraged, and the manager, Wei Baolin, repeatedly asked his superiors: "Please help us close down this chicken farm!" But the cadres in the district said: "This is the direction, we dare not take responsibility for this." The county said: "The prefectural committee and the provincial committee all know about this. Even if there is only one chicken left, we must continue to operate it, even if it means just guarding the chicken coop!" See how determined the higher-ups are to stick to this direction! Who should be responsible for the loss of the dead chicks? Wei Baolin went to the county committee to ask for instructions more than once, but everyone shirked responsibility. Wei Baolin felt he couldn't bear this responsibility and even attempted suicide by jumping into a well, but fortunately, he was seen by cooperative members and rescued.

　　From April 21, 1954, when the Weijiazhuang Chicken Farm opened, to April 21, 1955, it has been a full year. According to the usual practice of summarizing once a year, the Weijiazhuang Chicken Farm will of course also summarize. Please see the summary below:

　　Bought six thousand and thirty-six chicks. The cost plus the millet, corn, miscellaneous expenses, and feeders' wages amounts to a total expenditure of: two thousand one hundred and fourteen yuan, eight jiao, seven fen, and one li. Now there are eighty-eight chickens left. Deducting the income from eggs and chicken manure of sixty-nine yuan, three jiao, and two fen, the net investment in this chicken farm is two thousand and forty-five yuan, five jiao, and five fen and one li. On average, the cost per chicken is about twenty-three yuan, two jiao, four fen, and five li. How can a chicken farm like this become a direction?

### 二十三元一只鸡

　　二十三元一只鸡编辑同志：
    一九五四年春末夏初的时候，河南省林县魏家庄突然热闹起来，三五成群的农民、干部、学生络绎不绝地到魏家庄养鸡场来参观。在这个热闹的日子里，出主意搞这个鸡场的领导者该是多么高兴啊！他走到那夸到那：“这一下真给山区人民树立下方向了！”
    不料，过了几天，小鸡开始死亡了。鸡场场长魏保林起五更下了山向区委书记报告：小鸡买回来以后不见长。技术员萧敬生提议喂点咸盐。谁知小鸡吃了咸盐以后，第二天就死了一百多只，接着第三天、第四天一天比一天死的多了，现在已死了两千多只。
    场长说到这里似乎有些埋怨情绪，他说：鸡场刚办，咱们农业生产合作社曾提出没技术、不会喂，可是领导上却一再说咱们是重点社必须带头树立方向，没钱，国家可以贷款；没技术，县里的技术指导站可以派人来指导。这次萧敬生技术员是根据科学研究喂咸盐的，当时，我们没有一个人同意萧技术员这样做，但是，谁敢不相信科学呢？
    区委书记听了场长的汇报当然很生气，一边起床一边穿衣，脸也没洗就和场长一同走进鸡场，狠狠地把萧敬生技术员训斥了一顿，抖了阵威风就走开了。
    三天以后小鸡死亡的现象有些好转了。人们心中也平静了一些：“阿弥陀佛，可不能再死了！”但是，五天以后人们正在吃早饭，嘿！小鸡死亡又开始了！鸡场通宵总是常明灯，八个饲养员眼巴巴地看着小鸡一个个的死去，技术员再也没法施展他的技术了。他们只好把死亡数字记在账上，预备给社员们公布账目。
    眼看小鸡快要死完了，社员们意见很多。饲养员情绪消沉，场长魏保林多次向上级请求：“快点帮助结束这个鸡场吧！”但是区里的干部说：“这是方向，咱不敢当这个家。”县里说：“地委、省委都知道，最后剩下一只鸡，即使看守那座鸡舍也得要办下去！”你看，上级坚持树立方向这股劲该多么坚决！小鸡死亡的损失究竟该谁负责呢？魏保林不只一次地到县委会去请示，可是谁都推卸不管。魏保林感到负不了这个责任，竟跳井自杀，幸而被社员看见急救起来了。
    从一九五四年四月二十一日魏家庄鸡场开办的那天起，到一九五五年四月二十一日是整整一周年了。按通常一年一次总结的惯例，当然魏家庄鸡场也毫不例外的要总结一下了。请看下面的总结吧：
    买小鸡六千零三十六只，成本再加上喂去的小米、玉茭、杂支、饲养员的工资，总支出是：二千一百一十四元八角七分一厘，现在剩下八十八只鸡，除去鸡蛋鸡粪方面的收入六十九元三角二分外，这个鸡场净投资是二千零四十五元五角五分一厘，平均计算，每只鸡的成本应是二十三元二角四分五厘左右。像这样的养鸡场，怎样能成为方向呢？
