    We moved from Shandong to the Northeast and everyone took care of us
    To the Editor:
    I was originally a farmer from Sanjuzitun, Luchun Township, Tenth District, Liangshan County, Shandong Province. In recent years, our hometown has suffered continuous and severe floods, especially last year when we harvested nothing. The People's Government has always taken good care of us, and we can still eat and stay warm even after the disaster. This spring, they helped us move to the Northeast.
    When I first heard the news, I was worried that after moving to the Northeast, we would be unfamiliar with the place and the people, and that life would be difficult. After the government's repeated explanations, I agreed to move to Changling County, Jilin Province, with an uneasy feeling.
    When we set off from Liangshan County, many cadres from the county, district, and township kindly saw us off on the boat and repeatedly told us to be careful on the journey. The next day we transferred to a train and received thoughtful care all the way, arriving safely at Baokang Station. At the station, we were warmly welcomed by local leaders and fellow farmers. As soon as we got off the train, many women helped us hold the children, and men helped us carry the heavy things, taking us all the way to the store. Early the next morning, we took a car to the Sixth District People's Government of Changling County, where the comrades in the district treated us like relatives. In the afternoon, the carts from Victory Village came to pick us up, and we arrived at our destination at six o'clock in the afternoon.
    The living conditions we found in Victory Village were too good to fully describe! Weeks before we got there, the village had prepared all the things we needed for life. Firewood had been gathered, and pots, bowls, ladles, and basins were all there. Before our cart even arrived home, the villagers had already heated the kang. The village chief, the Party branch secretary, and the villagers came to our home to ask us about our situation, and they brought us anything we were missing. They were even closer than brothers!
    I have now joined the village's agricultural production cooperative. I promise to work hard in the cooperative, and together with my fellow villagers, build our beloved motherland and create a happier life for ourselves.

### 我们从山东移居到东北处处有人照顾

    我们从山东移居到东北处处有人照顾编辑同志：
    我原是山东省梁山县十区路春乡三咀屯的一个农民。几年来，我们家乡连续遭受严重的水灾，特别是去年颗粒没收。人民政府一直对我们照顾得很好，我们受了灾还能吃饱穿暖；今年春季，又帮助我们移居东北。
    在刚听到这个消息时，我顾虑移居东北以后，人地两生，怕日子不好过。经过政府多次解释，我才带着不安的心情，同意移居到吉林省长岭县去。
    从梁山县启程的时候，县、区、乡的不少干部都亲切地送我们上船，并再三嘱咐我们旅途多加小心。第二天我们换乘火车，一路上都受到周到的照顾，安全地到达了保康车站。在车站上，我们又受到了当地领导同志和农民兄弟的热情欢迎。我们刚一下车，很多妇女帮我们抱孩子，男子帮我们拿笨重的东西，一直把我们送到店里。第二天一早，我们又坐汽车到长岭县六区人民政府，区里的同志也是像接待亲人那样接待我们。午后，胜利村的大车就来接我们，午后六点就到达了目的地。
    我们到胜利村的生活状况，更是说不完的好啦！在十几天前，村里就把我们生活用的东西全都准备好啦。柴火给搂了，锅、碗、瓢、盆都一样不缺。没等我们的车到家，乡亲们已经把炕烧热啦。村长、党支部书记和老乡们又到我家来问长问短，看看缺什么东西又给我们送来。真是比兄弟还亲啊！
    我现在已经参加了村里的农业生产合作社。我保证在社里努力生产，同乡亲们一起建设我们可爱的祖国和创造我们更幸福的生活。
