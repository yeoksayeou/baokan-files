Farmers across the country planted nearly ten million mu of forest this spring. At present, with the exception of the Northeast, Northwest, and parts of North China where planting continues, most areas have completed their spring afforestation and are now engaged in tending and managing the young forests.

This spring, various regions vigorously planted timber forests in accordance with the needs of national economic construction. Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces planted large quantities of fast-growing eucalyptus timber forests. Hunan Province planted over 870,000 mu of fir trees and 880,000 mu of pine forests for construction purposes this spring. Jiangxi Province planted more than five times the amount of fir forest this spring compared to 1954. Hubei Province afforested a total of 760,000 mu of timber forests; thanks to sufficient rainfall this spring, the newly planted pine and fir seedlings are growing vigorously.

The majority of the new forests planted this year were collectively planted by cooperatives and mutual aid teams. In the Maoshan mountainous area of Jiangsu Province, 121 agricultural production cooperatives and 487 mutual aid teams contributed over 24,000 workdays to plant more than 16,000 mu of forest. In Lingling, Xinshao, and Xiangxiang counties of Hunan Province, the new forests planted by mutual aid and cooperative organizations accounted for more than 80% of the total afforestation area. The new forests planted by mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various regions have shifted from the past scattered and fragmented state to planned afforestation. (Xinhua News Agency)

　  今春农民造林近一千万亩
    各地农民在今年春季植树造林将近一千万亩。目前，除东北、西北和华北部分地区还在继续营造外，大部分地区春季造林已经结束，现正进行幼林抚育和养护管理。
    今年春季造林中，各地都根据国家经济建设的需要，大力营造了用材林。广东、广西和福建等省今年都栽种了大量生长较快的用材桉树林。湖南省今年春季营造了供建筑用的杉木林达八十七万多亩、松林八十八万多亩。江西省今年春季营造的杉木林比一九五四年增加五倍多。湖北省营造的用材林共达七十六万亩；由于今春雨水充足，新栽的松、杉等树苗都长得很茁壮。
    今年各地营造的新林，大部分是合作社和互助组集体营造的。江苏省茅山山区一百二十一个农业生产合作社、四百八十七个互助组出工二万四千多个，造林一万六千多亩。湖南省零陵、新邵、湘乡等县互助合作组织营造的新林就占造林总面积的百分之八十以上。各地互助合作组织营造的新林已由过去零星分散状况变成有计划造林。（新华社）
