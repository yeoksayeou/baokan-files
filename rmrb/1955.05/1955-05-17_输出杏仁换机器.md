　　Exporting Apricot Kernels to Exchange for Machinery
　　Yu Lihong
    Apricot trees grow in many provinces in our country, including Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shandong, Henan, as well as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Apricots are divided into sweet apricots and bitter apricots. Sweet apricots are not only a delicious seasonal fruit in the summer, but can also be made into apricot preserves, dried apricots, and other year-round foods. After removing the hard shell, its kernel is sweet almond, which is a raw material for making tea snacks, pastries, and almond flour. Bitter apricot flesh is inedible, but its kernel is a raw material for making medicine, alcohol, and machine oil. The hard shells of these two types of apricot kernels can also be used to manufacture caustic carbon and other chemical raw materials.
    Apricot kernel is one of our country's main export commodities. Exporting one ton of sweet almond can be exchanged for five and a half tons of steel.
    Our country's apricot kernel production is large and of good quality. They have been sold to countries such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, Japan, Switzerland, and the United States for a long time. During the Anti-Japanese War, many apricot trees were cut down and destroyed by imperialists and domestic reactionaries, resulting in a sharp decline in production and a corresponding reduction in exports. After liberation, the Party and the government advocated planting trees and protecting forests, and supported the development of production, and the production of apricots has continuously increased. 1953 was a year of abundant harvest, with sweet almond production of about 3 million jin, unprecedented in the past ten years, and bitter almond production of about 17 million jin, exceeding the highest annual output in history. The export of sweet almond in 1953 was two and a half times that of 1952, and the export volume of bitter almond exceeded the total export volume of sweet and bitter almonds in 1936.
  In 1954, the export of apricot kernel shells after grinding into powder also began.
    However, in 1954, due to the impact of natural disasters, the average production decreased by about half. At the same time, many apricot-producing areas squeezed oil from apricot kernels, which was a great waste. In addition, the procurement work was not thorough, which seriously affected the supply of export goods.
    In order to ensure the completion of the national export plan and exchange for the import materials necessary for national industrial construction, we should mobilize farmers to cultivate more apricot trees and protect existing apricot orchards and apricot trees. In particular, we should educate the vast number of women and children in apricot-producing areas not to pick and eat unripe green apricots. Apricots ripen in June and July, and we must publicize this to the people as early as possible and mobilize everyone to collect apricot kernels and sell them to the state. State-owned companies and cooperatives should strengthen their procurement work and organize rural peddlers to go deep into remote villages to collect scattered and fragmented apricot kernels.

　　输出杏仁换机器
　　禹理洪
    我国河北、山西、内蒙古、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、热河、陕西、甘肃、山东、河南以及江苏、浙江、安徽等省都生长着许多杏树。杏有甜杏苦杏之分，甜杏不只是夏季应时可口的水果，且可制成杏脯、杏干等常年食品。它的核去掉硬壳就是甜杏仁，是制造茶食、点心、杏仁粉的原料。苦杏肉不能吃，但它的核仁是制药、制酒精和机器用油的原料。这两种杏核的硬壳还可以制造苛性碳等化工原料。
    杏仁是我国的主要出口商品之一，出口一吨甜杏仁可以换回五吨半钢材。
    我国杏仁的产量大，品质好，很久以前就行销于德国、法国、荷兰、日本、瑞士、美国等国家。抗日战争期间，很多杏树被帝国主义者和国内反动派砍伐毁坏，产量锐减，输出也就相对减少。解放后，党和政府提倡植树护林，扶助发展生产，杏的产量不断增加。一九五三年为丰产年，甜杏仁约产三百余万斤，为近十年来所未有，苦杏仁约产一千七百余万斤，超过了历史上最高年产量。一九五三年出口的甜杏仁为一九五二年的两倍半，苦杏仁的出口量超过了一九三六年甜苦杏仁出口的总量。
  一九五四年又开始将杏核的硬壳磨成粉后出口。
    但是，一九五四年由于受天灾的影响，平均减产一半左右，同时有不少产杏区农民将杏仁榨油，浪费了很多，加之收购工作不深入，严重地影响到出口货源的供应。
    为了保证完成国家出口计划，换回国家工业建设必须的进口物资，应该发动农民多培植杏树，并保护已有的杏林、杏树。尤其应该教育产区广大妇女、儿童，不要摘食未成熟的绿杏。六、七月杏就成熟了，必须早些向人民宣传，动员大家收集杏核，卖给国家。国营公司、合作社要加强收购工作，并组织农村小贩深入偏僻村庄，收购分散零星的杏核。
