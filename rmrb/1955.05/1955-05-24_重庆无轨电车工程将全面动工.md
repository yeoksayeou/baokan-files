Chongqing Trolleybus Project to Fully Commence Construction

    The Chongqing trolleybus project will fully commence construction starting in June. Preparations are underway for the overhead lines, installation of substation equipment, repair of the depot, and road surface repairs. The trolleybus vehicles are being rushed into production by the Shanghai Bus Factory. It is expected that trolleybuses will be running in Chongqing by the spring of 1956.

    Since 1953, Chongqing City has been conducting surveying and design work for the trolleybus project, and partial construction has begun. Currently, the installation of reinforced concrete poles for trolleybus, electricity, and telecommunications, as well as the construction of substations, have been completed on the main road from Shangqingsi through Jiefangbei to Xiaoshizi, which is more than five kilometers long.

　　重庆无轨电车工程将全面动工
    重庆市的无轨电车工程将于六月份起全面动工。架空线路、安装变电设备、修停车场、整修路面等工程，正在进行开工前的准备。电车车辆正由上海客车厂赶制。预计一九五六年春，重庆就将有电车行驶。
    从一九五三年起，重庆市就开始进行无轨电车工程的勘测、设计工作，并开始部分施工。现在，从上清寺经解放碑到小什字全长五公里多的干道上，已经完成了安装电车、电力、电讯三用钢筋水泥杆的工程和修建变电站的工程。
