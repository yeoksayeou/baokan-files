Ways to Save Metal in the Mechanical Industry
Director of the Supply Bureau Office, First Ministry of Machine Building, Zhang Dadian

The mechanical industry is a metal processing industry, and metal consumption accounts for 90 percent of total material consumption. Improving the use of pig iron, steel, high-quality steel, copper, and other non-ferrous metals, and combating the phenomenon of metal waste, is the most important way for the mechanical industry to save raw materials. If we can save 1 percent of metal throughout the year, it will provide the country with thousands or even tens of thousands of tons of metal, reduce the amount of processing of mechanical equipment, save a lot of tools, increase labor productivity, and accumulate more funds for national construction.

One of the important methods of saving metal is to improve plan quality and rationally reserve metal.

At present, many enterprise supply personnel and their leaders, when preparing metal demand plans, do not deduct inventory, blindly increase reserve coefficients, and do not organize supply according to national allocation plans, but rely on market purchases to maintain production. As a result, production costs increase, and the phenomenon of metal backlog is very serious. In 1954, the average non-planned supply of metal in mechanical industry enterprises was 31.54 percent of the planned allocation, and in many enterprises, the non-planned supply of metal was as high as 60 percent or more. The actual inventory of metal at the end of the year averaged 246 percent of the planned reserve at the end of the year. Ordinary steel can supply the consumption of all enterprises for 257 days, high-quality steel can supply for 316 days, and non-ferrous metals can supply for 531 days. The large backlog of metal not only stagnates a large amount of working capital, but also affects the full utilization of the country's effective resources, and to some extent even affects the speed of expanded socialist reproduction and the development of national industrial construction.

To overcome blind purchasing and reduce metal reserves to a minimum, a lot of work needs to be done: First, production plans must be prepared and communicated to enterprises in a timely and correct manner, providing a strong basis for enterprises to prepare metal demand plans. The unreasonable planning procedure of placing supply plans before production plans must be changed to overcome the blindness and confusion of supply work. Second, metal reserve quotas must be formulated, the demand and circulation of each metal must be comprehensively calculated, the supervision of quota reserves must be implemented, the analysis and comparison of metal reserves and metal consumption must be carried out regularly, and the metal reserves exceeding the quotas must be actively handled. Third, reduce the variety of materials or unify the numerous metal varieties and specifications. This can not only reduce the amount of production reserves, but also enable metallurgical factories to reduce the overly complicated product varieties, reduce the load on steel rolling axles, and increase labor productivity. Fourth, all enterprises must carefully prepare annual metal demand plans, carefully modify and supplement quarterly plans, correct the idea of relying on temporary purchases to maintain production needs with non-planned supplies, and gradually bring temporary purchases into the orbit of quarterly plans. The enterprises' demand plans should be carefully reviewed to prevent blind applications from causing metal backlogs. In organizing orders, attention should be paid to the technical conditions of product supply to prevent using large materials for small purposes and wasting metal. Fifth, when preparing metal demand plans, all user enterprises should try to use multiple-size bars and steel plates that meet the required dimensions to reduce metal processing waste. The phenomenon of metal loss caused by unedged steel plates and high scrap rates of forgings in current orders should be gradually overcome on the basis of strengthening production coordination and close planning links.

Rational use of metal and improving metal utilization are also important methods of saving metal.

Material consumption quotas are the basis for preparing material technical supply plans, and are the regulatory and organizational forces for saving metal. Therefore, advanced material consumption quotas must be formulated to promote the rational use of metal and improve metal utilization.

At present, many enterprises use outdated quotas to apply to the state for metal, and many enterprises deliberately increase the quota coefficient in order to apply for metal that is difficult for the state to meet during allocation. Many enterprises use metal irrationally, with a lot of large materials used for small purposes and high-quality materials used for low-quality purposes; the metal utilization rate of general enterprises can only reach 40 to 50 percent, and 50 to 60 percent of the metal is cut into waste; the ratio of product net weight to material consumption quota is 1:1.7 to 1:2, that is, 1.7 tons to 2 tons of metal are consumed to manufacture one ton of product.

When formulating material consumption quotas, many enterprises stipulate a large processing allowance. The cutting depth of many processed parts reaches 4 to 7 mm, and forgings are generally above 10 mm, and even as high as about 20 mm. This situation is mainly due to the great conservativeness of the enterprise's production technology department in stipulating the processing allowance, and even the quotas that have been proven to be backward by advanced workers in actual production have not been revised in time. For example, the crankshaft blank plan of the Shanghai Turbine Plant was 1,722 kg, but only 777 kg was actually needed; the planning cutting rate of the rocker arm drill casting of the Shenyang Second Machine Tool Plant was 35 percent, but only 21 percent was actually needed. This not only causes a large loss of metal, but also increases the equipment load of the mechanical workshop and wastes a lot of man-hours due to excessive cutting workload, which affects the reduction of production volume.

In order to overcome waste, material consumption quotas, especially technological material consumption quotas, must be formulated. This is a crucial link in saving metal. When formulating technological quotas, we should start with major products and major materials as a tool for preparing supply plans and supervising plan execution. At the same time, we should also sort out and analyze the existing actual consumption quotas, and modify the old quotas to reach the level of advanced quotas. After the material consumption quota is formulated, the enterprise's supply organization must strictly supervise the metal consumption in actual production according to the quota, and promptly propose and formulate new quotas according to the continuous development of production technology.

Adopting the most reasonable product structure to reduce the weight of products has special importance for the machinery manufacturing industry. When designing and manufacturing new products, we should widely use advanced technical data from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, and choose product models with the least material consumption and the lightest structure to minimize the consumption of metal. We must also improve the process flow, adopt the most advanced production process methods, and reduce the loss of metal during the cutting process.

At present, the phenomenon of high scrap rate and low qualification rate is common in various enterprises. For example, the scrap rate of steel castings is generally 8 to 15 percent, and some enterprises reach more than 40 percent, and even all castings are scrapped. Metal processed parts and forgings are also constantly producing defective products, and the materials reissued for this purpose account for a large proportion. We must improve process methods, improve production technology level, apply new casting equipment and forging equipment, and eliminate the loss of metal caused by backward production technology.

The mechanical industry continuously produces scrap metal during the production of processing metal. We must strengthen technical research, try to use recycled scrap to re-enter production, and strengthen the utilization of edge and corner waste. Centralized cutting and the implementation of a quota-based material distribution system are also important methods of saving metal.

Distributing the metal necessary for production to workshops, work sections, work groups or each machine tool according to the prescribed quota is one of the effective measures to avoid metal loss. However, at present, the material supply work in a large number of enterprises is quite chaotic. In these enterprises, the material requisition and return system is not strict, and workers can misappropriate materials at will without any procedures. Some enterprises even hand over the warehouse keys to non-warehouse management personnel; a large number of "black materials" are stored in the workshop, and "black materials" are used for production. Many enterprises lack strict production management systems, and the parts produced in the workshop are not managed by special personnel, and a large number of parts are lost without anyone caring. A large number of semi-finished products are stored in each workshop and each process, with layer-by-layer reserves and layer-by-layer "insurance", so that the semi-finished products exceed the product plan by two to three times. What is most intolerable is that in order to complete the output value task, materials are blindly put into production, resulting in serious scrapping of a large number of semi-finished products. These chaotic phenomena have, to varying degrees, caused economic losses and waste of metal to the country.

In order to ensure both balanced and complete supply of production and to save metal, all production enterprises must implement a quota-based material distribution system according to material consumption quotas and production plans. Each workshop cannot receive metal exceeding the quota, and the metal reissued due to the production of defective products must also be issued after the workshop director and the technical inspection section submit a defect compensation application and it is approved by the factory director.

To implement quota-based material distribution, it is necessary to implement centralized blanking of metal profiles and rational cutting methods of metal sheets. Centralized cutting of metal can greatly reduce material consumption quotas, facilitate the calculation of material consumption, and reduce the non-productive affairs of production workers. The blanks after centralized cutting should be sent directly from the warehouse to the workshop or workplace. At the same time, material return procedures and scrap recycling should be carried out in accordance with the prescribed quota. This can eliminate the incompleteness of semi-finished product production, prevent excessive occupation of metal, and strengthen the struggle to reduce scrap loss.

In enterprises implementing quota-based material distribution, material-using workshops should prepare a comparison table of material consumption. Through this comparison table, they can clearly understand the total amount of metal received by each workshop from the warehouse, the quantity and weight of finished products delivered, the amount of semi-finished products currently existing, and the weight of scrap delivered, so as to grasp the causes of metal waste and savings, and be able to promptly propose measures to improve work.

In order to make saving metal a mass movement of the broad masses of employees, advanced enterprises can specifically stipulate the amount of materials and tools consumed by each machine tool, carry out personal saving movements, and create conditions for promoting "team accounting."

Saving metal should become one of the central and regular tasks of mechanical industrial enterprises in 1955. We still have great potential in saving metal. For example, on the basis of the existing production technology level, strengthening quota management, improving process methods, and increasing metal utilization, it is very possible to save 3 to 5 percent of metal. If we can reach this planned target, it means that the product cost will be reduced by 2.1 to 3.5 percent, and 10,000 to 15,000 metal cutting machine tools weighing 2.5 tons each can be produced for the country. This is a work of great economic significance. All enterprises should actively mobilize, formulate action plans for saving metal, attract all staff, workers, and engineering and technical personnel to participate, and launch a struggle to strive for saving metal and strive for over-planned capital accumulation!

　　机械工业节约金属的途径
　　第一机械工业部供应局办公室主任　张大巅
    机械工业是金属加工工业，金属消耗量占全部材料消耗量的百分之九十。改进生铁、钢、优质钢、铜和其他有色金属的使用情况，同浪费金属的现象作斗争，是机械工业节约原材料的最重要的途径。我们如果全年能够节约金属百分之一，就会给国家提供数千吨甚至上万吨的金属，并可减少机械设备的加工量，节约大量的工具，提高劳动生产率，为国家建设积累更多的资金。
    节约金属的重要方法之一，是提高计划质量，合理储备金属。
    现在有不少企业的供应人员及其领导者，他们在编制金属需用计划时，不核减库存量，盲目加大储备系数，不根据国家的分配计划组织供应，却依靠市场采购来维持生产，结果生产成本增高，金属积压的现象也很严重。一九五四年机械工业各企业非计划供应的金属平均为计划分配的百分之三十一点五四，不少企业非计划供应的金属高达百分之六十以上。年末实际库存的金属平均为年末计划储备的百分之二百四十六，普通钢材可供全部企业二百五十七天的消费，优质钢可供三百一十六天的消费，有色金属可供五百三十一天的消费。金属的大量积压，不仅呆滞了大量流动资金，并且影响了国家有效资源的充分利用，在某种程度上甚至影响到扩大的社会主义再生产的速度和国家工业建设的发展。
    克服盲目采购，缩减金属储备到最小限度，需要进行很多工作：第一，及时而正确地编制生产计划并下达到企业中去，给企业编制金属需用计划提供有力依据，改变供应计划在前生产计划布置在后的不合理的计划程序，以克服供应工作的盲目性和混乱现象。第二，必须制定金属储备定额，全面地计算每种金属的需用量和流通量，实施定额储备的监督，按期进行金属储备和金属消耗情况的分析和比较，积极处理超定额储备的金属。第三，减少材料品种或者把繁多的金属品种、规格统一起来。这样不但可以减少生产储备的数量，而且可使冶金工厂减少过于繁杂的产品品种，减轻轧钢轴滚的负荷，提高劳动生产率。第四，所有企业都须认真编制年度金属需用计划，认真进行季度计划的修改和补充，纠正依靠临时采购维持生产需要的非计划供应的思想，并逐步把临时的采购纳入季度计划的轨道。对企业的需用计划，要认真审查，防止盲目申请造成金属积压。在组织订货当中，要注意产品供应的技术条件，防止大材小用，浪费金属。第五，各需用企业在编制金属需用计划时，应尽量采用成倍性的棒材和合于需用尺码的钢板，以减少金属的加工余料。目前订货中存在的钢板不切边、锻坯报废率大所造成的金属损失现象，应当在加强生产协作和密切计划联系的基础上逐步加以克服。
    合理使用金属，提高金属利用率，也是节约金属的重要方法。
    材料消耗定额是编制材料技术供应计划的依据，是节约金属的调节力量和组织力量，因此，必须制定先进的材料消耗定额，以促进合理地使用金属，提高金属的利用率。
    现在有不少企业用落后了的定额向国家申请金属，更有不少企业为了多申请国家在分配时不易满足的金属而故意加大定额系数。不少企业对于金属使用得不合理，大材小用、优材劣用的现象很多；一般企业的金属利用率只能达到百分之四十至五十，有百分之五十到六十的金属被切削成废料；产品净重和材料消耗定额之比为一比一点七到一比二，就是说，制造一吨产品要消耗一点七吨到二吨金属。
    不少企业在制定材料消耗定额时，规定了很大的加工留量，很多加工件切削深度达四到七公厘，锻件一般在十公厘以上，甚至有高达二十公厘左右的。这种情况主要是企业的生产技术部门在规定加工留量时有很大保守性，甚至在实际生产中业已被先进工人证明为落后了的定额也未能及时修改。如上海汽轮机厂曲轴毛坯计划为一千七百二十二公斤，实际只需七百七十七公斤；沈阳第二机床厂摇臂钻床铸件切削率计划为百分之三十五，实际只需百分之二十一。这不仅造成金属的大量损失，而且由于切削工作量过多过大，也增加了机械车间的设备负荷量，浪费很多工时，以至影响到生产量的缩减。
    为了克服浪费，必须制定材料消耗定额，特别是工艺性材料消耗定额。这是对节约金属具有决定意义的一环。在制定工艺性定额时，应该先从主要产品及主要材料着手，以此作为编制供应计划和监督计划执行的工具，同时还要整理分析现有的实际消耗定额，修改旧定额使之达到先进定额的水平。材料消耗定额制定之后，企业的供应机构就要严格按照定额监督实际生产中的金属消耗情况，并根据生产技术的不断发展，及时提出并制定新的定额。
    采用最合理的制品构造来达到减轻制品的重量，对于机械制造工业具有特殊重要的意义。我们在设计和制造新产品时，应广泛采用苏联和人民民主国家的先进技术资料，选择材料消耗最少、构造最轻便的产品型号，以尽量减少金属的消费量。还必须改进工艺程序，采用最先进的生产工艺方法，减少金属在切削过程中的损失。
    目前在各企业中普遍存在废品率大，合格率低的现象。如钢铁铸件废品率一般在百分之八到百分之十五，有的企业达到百分之四十以上，甚至还有全部铸件报废的。金属加工件和锻件也不断产生废品，为此而补发的材料占很大比重。必须改进工艺方法，提高生产技术水平，应用新型铸造设备和锻压设备，消灭由于生产技术落后所造成的金属的损失。
    机械工业在加工金属的生产中同时不断产生废金属。我们要加强技术研究，尽量利用回收的废料重新投入生产，并加强边角余料的利用。集中剪裁，推行限额发料制度，也是节约金属的重要方法。
      按照规定的限额发给车间、工段、工作组或每个机床进行生产所必需的金属，是避免金属遭受损失的有效措施之一。但是，现在有很大一部分企业对于车间的材料供应工作是相当混乱的。在这些企业中，领料、退料制度不严格，工人可以不经过任何手续随便挪用材料。有的企业竟把仓库的钥匙交给非仓库管理人员；车间存有大批的“黑料”，并用“黑料”进行生产。不少企业缺乏严格的生产管理制度，车间生产出来的零件无专人管理，大量丢失而无人过问。各车间各工序都存有很大数量的在制品，层层储备层层“保险”，以致在制品超过产品计划二到三倍。最令人不能容忍的是为了完成产值任务，盲目投料，因而造成在制品大量报废的严重情况。这些混乱现象，都在不同程度上给国家造成了经济损失和金属的浪费。
    为了既能保证均衡而齐备地供应生产，又能节约金属，各生产企业必须根据材料消耗定额和生产计划，推行限额发料制度。各车间不能超过定额得到金属，由于产生废品所补发的金属，亦必须由车间主任和技术检查科提出补废申请书经厂长批准后始能发给。
    推行限额发料，必须实行金属型材集中下料和金属板材的合理剪裁方法。金属集中剪裁，可以大大降低材料消耗定额，并便于计算材料的消耗，且可以减少生产工人进行非生产性的事务。集中裁切后的坯料，应由仓库直接送到车间或工作地，同时还要按照规定的限额办理退料手续和回收废料。这样就可以消除在制品生产的不齐备性，防止过多地占用金属，又能加强减少废料损失的斗争。
    在实行限额发料的企业中，用料车间要编制材料耗用对照表，通过这个对照表，可以清楚地了解各车间从仓库收到的全部金属数量，交出的成品数量和重量，现存在制品的数量，交出废料的重量，从而掌握金属浪费和节约的原因，能以及时提出改进工作的措施。
    为了使节约金属成为广大职工的群众性运动，先进的企业可具体规定每台机床消耗材料及工具的数量，开展个人节约运动，为推行“班组核算”创立条件。
    节约金属工作应成为机械工业企业一九五五年中心任务和经常任务之一。我们在节约金属方面还存在着很大的潜在力量，如在现有生产技术水平的基础上，加强定额管理，改进工艺方法，提高金属利用率，节约金属百分之三到百分之五是有很大可能的。如果我们能够达到这个计划指标，便意味着产品成本降低百分之二点一到百分之三点五，可给国家增产重二点五吨的金属切削机床一万到一万五千台。这是一个有重大经济意义的工作。所有企业应积极地动员起来，拟订节约金属的行动计划，吸引全体工作人员、工人、工程技术人员参加，展开为争取节约金属，争取超计划的资金积累而斗争！
