　　Tianjin residents enthusiastic about public welfare, with the assistance of district democratic women's federations and trade unions and other relevant departments, have established twenty-nine street nurseries, accommodating more than 1,200 children, solving the difficulties of many working women who cannot take care of their children while working.
    Most of these nurseries are located near factories and streets with a large number of female workers. Many of the houses and utensils used are automatically lent by the residents. The nursery staff are made up of women representatives from the street, among others.
    At present, there are 334 municipal and large factories, schools, and institutions in Tianjin that have established nurseries, accommodating more than 10,000 children. However, the problem of childcare for the children of female workers in many small factories or handicraft production cooperatives has not been resolved. After mobilizing residents to run street nurseries, the difficulties of some female workers can be appropriately resolved. The No. 8 Toothbrush Handicraft Production Cooperative has forty female members, twelve of whom requested to withdraw from the cooperative because of the burden of their children. Now that a nursery has been established near the cooperative, these female workers' difficulties have been resolved, and they no longer request to withdraw from the cooperative.

### 天津居民积极自办街道托儿站

　　天津居民积极自办街道托儿站
    天津市各街道热心于公益事业的居民，在各区民主妇女联合会和工会等有关部门协助下，创办了二十九处街道托儿站，共收容一千二百多名幼儿，解决了很多劳动妇女在工作中无法照管孩子的困难。
    这些托儿站大都分布在工厂附近和女工较多的街道上，所用的房屋、用具很多是由居民们自动出借的。保育员由本街的妇女代表等人担任。
    目前天津全市虽有三百三十四处市立和大型工厂、学校、机关设立的托儿所，收容了一万多名儿童，但是许多小型工厂或手工业生产合作社女工的孩子寄托问题还是不能解决。发动居民自办街道托儿站后，就可适当解决有些女工的困难。八区牙刷手工业生产合作社有四十名女社员，其中有十二人因受孩子拖累要求退社，现在合作社附近建立了托儿站，这些女工的困难得到了解决后，便不再要求退社了。（新华社）
