　　Reform of the Railway Freight Rate System

Beginning June 1st, the national railways will implement new freight and passenger rates. This is a significant measure to unify and reform China's railway freight rates and adjust unreasonable passenger ticket prices. This measure is of great significance for developing the people's railway cause and promoting the upsurge of the national economy. All Party and government organs, enterprise departments, mass organizations, and the vast number of passengers have a responsibility to vigorously assist the railway departments in smoothly implementing this reform.

Regarding the unification of railway freight rates and the reform of the freight rate system, its main contents are: First, to unify freight rates while maintaining the existing freight rate level; second, with the goal of promoting socialist industrialization, to distinguish between means of production and consumer goods, between necessities and non-necessities for people's lives, and between goods with different transportation conditions, adopting a new system of numbered freight rates to replace the previous, somewhat unreasonable, ad valorem grading system that determined freight rates based on commodity prices to some extent; third, to stipulate preferential price reduction measures for the rational use of transportation tools. These are all correct methods to meet the requirements of China's unified economic plan and to promote the development of the national economy, especially the development of China's heavy industry.

Formulating different freight rates based on different regional conditions was appropriate during the economic recovery period and, due to the varying times of national liberation, was also unavoidable. However, after the start of nationwide economic construction, the lack of unified freight rates brought difficulties to all aspects of work, affected the exchange of materials between different regions, and caused enterprises to bear different freight costs due to their different locations, hindering the cost management work and the implementation of the economic accounting system in various enterprises. Unifying national freight rates is of great benefit to enterprises in formulating production plans and correctly calculating product costs, in uniformly examining the level of enterprise operation and management, and in reducing the hassle of freight calculation and saving manpower.

The current freight rate is divided into thirty grades, among which the freight rates for major bulk materials such as coal, coke, ore, and timber are relatively low, which is basically in line with the requirements of socialist industrialization. However, the grading of many goods is also unreasonable. For example, industrial explosives and cosmetics are classified as the same grade, and hay, reeds, and pig iron are also classified as the same grade, resulting in higher freight rates for individual industrial means of production, which is detrimental to China's industrial construction. In addition, short-distance transportation freight rates are too low; for long-distance transportation goods, the method of decreasing freight rates with increasing distance is uniformly implemented, and there are no restrictions on repetitive, counter-current, and unreasonable transportation, or on goods that should be transported by water. This freight rate system not only wastes railway transport capacity but is also detrimental to the development of the national economy. Therefore, in this freight rate system reform, the grades and freight rates of various goods are separately stipulated according to national economic policies, commodity production and sales conditions, and the conditions required for transportation; methods for reducing freight rates for major materials within reasonable transport distances are stipulated; and methods for increasing freight rates are separately stipulated for short-distance goods that can be transported by automobiles or horse-drawn carts, goods that violate reasonable flow directions, goods that are unreasonably transported too far, and goods that can be transported by waterway. This is entirely correct and necessary.

Generally speaking, this reform of freight rates has not increased railway freight rates. More than 80 percent of railway freight is bulk materials controlled by the state, and the increase or decrease in freight rates in various regions and enterprises is entirely adjusted and controlled within state organs, which will not affect market commodity prices. For other small commodities and non-staple foods, local specialties, etc., preferential treatment methods such as reduced special prices have been adopted to ensure the stability of prices.

While unifying freight rates and rationally reforming the freight rate system, passenger transport rates have also been adjusted to change the somewhat unreasonable phenomenon of railway passenger transport rates. At present, passenger transport rates are generally too low, which cannot guarantee the cost of railway transportation. This is detrimental to the development of railway transportation and to the long-term interests of the people. On the other hand, from the perspective of the proportion of various fares, the fares for lower-class train types are too high, while the fares for higher-class train types are too low, which is also unreasonable. Therefore, the new passenger transport rate stipulates that, on the basis of increasing the price of hard seat tickets by 30 percent, the prices of soft seat cars and various sleeper cars will also be increased in appropriate proportions, while the prices of simple trains and suburban trains will be appropriately reduced.

The adjustment of passenger ticket prices is beneficial to the railway because it can guarantee transportation costs and a certain amount of accumulation. Currently, compared with the general price index, the prices of major materials are about twice as high as before the War of Resistance, while passenger ticket prices are still 10 percent lower than before the war. At present, the passing time for one passenger train is equal to 1.5 freight trains, but the income of one passenger train is much less than that of one freight train. This cannot guarantee the source of investment for various facilities serving passengers and is not conducive to the development of passenger transport. After the adjustment of passenger ticket prices, and with the efforts of all railway employees, it will be possible to maintain transportation costs and strive for a certain accumulation.

The adjustment of passenger transport rates is beneficial to the vast number of passengers. First of all, it improves the unreasonable phenomenon that fares for lower-class train types are too high and fares for higher-class train types are too low, so that the conditions enjoyed by passengers and the prices paid are mutually adapted, and the burden reaches fairness and reasonableness. Secondly, it reduces the prices of simple passenger trains, suburban trains, and freight car substitute passenger cars for short-distance rides, which greatly facilitates the exchanges between farmers and workers near major cities and reduces the burden on commuting employees and students. The reduction in ticket prices and the increase in passengers on this part of the train will inevitably appropriately improve the phenomenon of overcrowding on some long-distance trains. More importantly, the adjustment of passenger transport rates can not only enable the railway department to increase the necessary equipment related to improving passenger service measures but also ensure a certain accumulation to further develop the railway transportation industry.

The adjustment of passenger ticket prices increases the burden on some passengers, but this burden is justified. The railway is China's socialist enterprise, that is, an enterprise owned by the whole people. On the one hand, it should conscientiously serve the people; on the other hand, the people of the whole country also have a responsibility to maintain it. Guaranteeing the transportation cost of railway passenger transport is an important manifestation of caring for the railway. Under the conditions of the ever-improving living standards of the people of the whole country, it is entirely possible and necessary to change the unreasonable phenomenon that passenger transport rates were too low in the past.

The new freight and passenger rates are about to be implemented. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of this reform, in addition to doing a good job in propaganda and explanation, all employees of the railway department must also quickly prepare various preparations, actively improve service work, strengthen contact with relevant transportation departments, and actively help them solve the various difficulties that may be encountered at the beginning of the implementation of the new freight rates. Financial and trade organs should also earnestly strengthen financial supervision and market management to ensure the stability of enterprise material transportation and market prices. As long as all parties strengthen cooperation, coupled with the support of the people of the whole country, this reform of railway transportation will surely be successfully realized.

### 改革铁路运价制度

　　改革铁路运价制度
    从六月一日开始，全国铁路就要实行新的货物运价和旅客运价了。这是统一和改革我国铁路的货物运价、调整客票票价不合理现象的一个重大措施。这项措施对发展人民铁道事业和促进国民经济的高涨具有重大意义。所有的党政机关、企业部门、群众团体和广大的旅客，都有责任大力协助铁道部门顺利地贯彻这项改革工作。
    就统一铁路货物运价和改革运价制度来说，它的主要内容是：一、在保持现有运价水平的基础上，统一货物运价；二、以促进社会主义工业化为目标，区别生产资料和消费资料、区别人民生活必需品和非必需品、区别不同运送条件的货物，采用分号运价的新制度，代替以往在某种程度上根据商品价格的高低确定货物运价高低的不完全合理的从价分等制度；三、规定合理使用运输工具的减价优待办法。这些都是为了适应我国统一经济计划的要求，为了促进国民经济的发展，特别是促进我国重工业的发展的正确办法。
    根据不同情况制定不同地区的运价，在经济恢复时期是恰当的，而且由于全国解放的时间先后不一，也是不可避免的。但是在全国范围的经济建设开始以后，运价不统一就给各方面工作带来了困难，影响不同地区的物资交流，使得各企业因所处地区不同而负担不同的运费，妨碍各企业的成本管理工作和经济核算制度的贯彻。统一全国货物运价，对于各企业制定生产计划和正确核算产品成本、对于统一考查企业经营管理水平、以及减少运费计算的麻烦、节约人力等等方面，都有莫大好处。
    现行货物运价分为三十等，其中大宗主要物资如煤焦、矿石、木材等运价都比较低，这是基本上与社会主义工业化的要求相适应的。但是，也有许多货物的分等是不合理的。例如工业用的炸药和化妆品列为同等，谷草、芦苇和生铁也列为同等，结果就使个别工业所需的生产资料运价偏高，这是不利于我国工业建设的。又如近距离运输运价太低；远距离运输的货物，一律实行递远递减办法，对于重复、对流的不合理运输和应由航运的货物没有从运价上加以限制。这种运价制度既造成铁路运输力的浪费，也不利于国民经济的发展。因此，在这次运价制度改革中，根据国家经济政策、货物产销情况、运送所需条件等，分别规定了各种货物的分号和运价；规定了主要物资在合理运程内减低运价的办法；对可用汽车、骡马大车运输的短距离货物、违反合理流向的货物、不合理地运输过远的货物以及可以由水路运输的货物，都分别规定了增加运费的办法，这是完全正确的和必要的。
    这次货物运价的改革，总的说来，对铁道货运运价是没有增加的。铁路货运中百分之八十以上是国家掌握的大宗物资，各地区和各企业运价的增减完全由国家机关内部调整和控制，不会影响市场商品价格。对其它小宗物资和副食品、土、特产等等，又采取了减成特价的优待办法，也保证了物价的稳定。
    在统一运价、合理地改革货运运价制度的同时，还调整了客运运价，改变铁路客运运价不完全合理的现象。现在的客运运价，一方面是普遍偏低，不能保证铁路运输成本，这对铁路运输的发展和对人民的长远利益说来，都是不利的。另一方面，从各种票价的比例来看，低级车种票票价偏高，高级车种票票价偏低，这也是不合理的。因此，新的客运运价规定了在提高硬席车票票价百分之三十的基础上，对软席车和各种卧车的票价也以适当的比例加以提高，而对简易列车和近郊列车则适当降低。
    客运票价的调整，就铁路来说，好处是可以保证运输成本和一定的积累。目前客运票价和一般物价指数相比，主要物资的价格约为抗战前的二倍，而客票价却比战前还低百分之十。目前办理一列客车的通过时间等于一·五列货车，而一列客车的收入却比一列货车少得多。这就不能保证为旅客服务的各种设备的投资来源，就不利于发展客运事业。调整客运票价后，再经过全体铁路员工的努力，就可以保持运输成本，并争取一定的积累。
    客运运价的调整，对广大旅客是有好处的。首先，就是改进了各种票价之间低级车种票票价偏高、而高级车种票票价偏低的不合理现象，使旅客享受的条件和支付的代价互相适应，负担达到公平合理。其次，就是减低了短距离乘坐的简易客车、近郊列车以及货车代用客车的票价，大大便利了广大城市附近农民和工人的往来，减轻了通勤职工和通勤学生的负担。这一部分列车票价的降低和乘客的增加，又必然会适当地改善现有一些长途列车过分拥挤的现象。而更为重要的，客运运价的调整，不仅可以使铁路部门增加一些有关提高旅客服务措施的必要设备，还可以保证有一定的积累来进一步发展铁路运输事业。
    调整客运票价对一部分旅客来说是增加了负担，不过这种负担是应该的。铁路是我国的社会主义企业，也就是全民所有的企业。一方面，它应该兢兢业业地为人民服务；另一方面全国人民也有责任来保养它。保证铁路客运的运输成本就是爱护铁路的一个重要表现。在全国人民生活水平日益改善的条件下，改变过去客运运价偏低的不合理现象，也是完全可以的和必需的。
    新的客货运价就要开始实行了，为了保证这项改革的顺利实现，除了宣传解释工作必须做好以外，铁道部门的所有职工，还必须迅速作好各种准备工作，积极改善服务工作，和有关运输部门加强联系，积极帮助他们解决实行新运价之初可能碰到的各种困难。财政贸易机关也应该切实加强财政监督和市场管理，保证各企业物资运输工作和市场物价的稳定。只要各方面加强协作，再加上全国人民的支持，铁路运输的这项改革，就一定能够顺利地实现。
