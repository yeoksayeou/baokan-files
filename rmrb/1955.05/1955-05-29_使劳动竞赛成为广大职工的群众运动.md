　　Labor competition is an important method for mobilizing the creativity and enthusiasm of the working masses to carry out socialist construction; it is a driving force for increasing labor productivity and improving production. In order to guarantee the realization of the national construction plan, establish a foundation for national industrialization and modernization of national defense, vigorously support the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and mobilize all employees to continue to deepen the labor competition and strive to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the national plan, it is a major political task of the Party, administrative, and trade union organizations in socialist enterprises.
    Over the past few years, the labor competition of the broad masses of workers in our country has developed greatly under the unified leadership of the Party. In 1950, more than 600,000 workers across the country participated in the labor competition; in 1954, in Hebei and Shandong provinces alone, more than 600,000 workers participated in the labor competition. In the labor competition, workers have generally paid attention to the issues of improving technology and increasing labor productivity; the organizational leadership of labor competition has also been relatively in-depth. The development of labor competition has played an extremely important role in guaranteeing the completion of the national construction plan.
    However, not all enterprises have paid attention to the work of labor competition. Some enterprises do not organize labor competitions all year round, and some enterprises only launch a competition around Labor Day on May 1st or National Day in October in order to rush tasks. Even in enterprises where labor competition is more frequent, there is generally a lack of in-depth leadership and specific organizational work. As a result, many factories and mines, many workshops, and many groups and workers cannot complete tasks according to the various economic indicators stipulated by the state; there are still many advanced experiences that have not been summarized and promoted; there are still phenomena of focusing on shock tactics and physical exertion in labor competition; the policy of safe production has not been seriously implemented, so casualties and equipment accidents continue to occur. These facts show that many enterprise leaders still do not pay enough attention to the political work of the masses, or are not good at leading the political work of the masses, so they cannot further mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers, solve the difficulties in production, and promote the development of production.
    One of the main goals of labor competition in industrial enterprises is to improve the level of technology and overcome the current serious state of backward industrial technology in our country. In April 1954, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, based on the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, made a decision on carrying out a technical innovation movement nationwide, and regarded the technical innovation movement as the main content of improving the current labor competition. The development of the technical innovation movement has played a certain role in promoting the broad masses of workers to learn and master new technologies, and has also achieved some results, which should be affirmed. However, the slogan of technical innovation cannot be adapted to all industrial enterprises, and even in enterprises that urgently need to improve the level of industrial technology, it cannot be adapted to all employees. Therefore, these statements have caused some confusion and adverse effects in the development process of labor competition. Not long ago, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, after inspection, believed that the statements such as "carrying out the technical innovation movement" and "regarding the technical innovation movement as the main content of improving the current labor competition" were inaccurate and imperfect, and these statements should be stopped. This is completely necessary and correct.
    The equipment and technical conditions of industrial enterprises in our country are extremely complex. In some newly built enterprises and enterprises expanded and rebuilt with the latest Soviet equipment, the current task of all employees is mainly how to learn from the Soviet Union, improve technology, and master technology so that the existing equipment can exert its due effectiveness. In some existing enterprises with relatively backward equipment and technical conditions, in order to further improve production, it is not necessary to improve the structure of existing production equipment or the production technology process. The slogan of "technical innovation" is not clear enough, and after the technical innovation movement was carried out, there was a lack of specific organizational work, so many people only paid attention to inventions and technical improvements, ignoring the learning and mastering of the Soviet Union's advanced technical experience, and ignoring the summary and implementation of our country's existing effective advanced experience. However, invention and creation are a matter for a few people, and most people cannot invent and create. Labor competition, on the other hand, is a matter for the majority of people, and even a matter of national nature, and labor competition must be made a mass movement of the broad masses of workers. This is an urgent political task for all enterprise leaders.
    Of course, changing the statement about technical innovation does not mean that we should not innovate our technology, nor does it mean that we can take an indifferent attitude towards workers' inventions and creations and various rationalization proposals. On the contrary, constantly improving the level of industrial technology on the existing basis and gradually mastering the new technologies of modern industry is an important condition for our country to realize socialist industrialization. Therefore, in the labor competition, we must mobilize the broad masses of workers in a guided and organized manner, actively learn and master new technologies, and strive to improve and improve technology, especially to seriously learn and promote the advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union.
    What is the main content of the current labor competition? This cannot be uniformly prescribed. All localities, industrial systems, and enterprises should adopt practical content and forms based on the specific circumstances and the requirements of the workers. For example, in basic construction, the goal of labor competition should be to improve technology, ensure project quality, and reduce project costs. In smelting and machinery production enterprises, the competition goal should be to trial-produce new products and increase new varieties; in coal and oil production enterprises, efforts should be made to increase production; in the textile industry and light industry departments, efforts should be made to save various raw materials and produce more high-quality and low-priced products on the premise of ensuring and improving quality. In the transportation sector, the important goals of labor competition should be to accelerate the turnover of vehicles and ships, improve equipment utilization, improve transportation quality, and reduce transportation costs. In state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, the important goal of labor competition should be to reduce commodity circulation costs.
    In order to more widely and more frequently mobilize all employees to carry out labor competition, the Party, administrative, and trade union organizations in enterprises should actively care about the lives of the working masses, especially to implement correct wage and labor reward systems, which is an important material basis for promoting labor competition. In the past few years, the economism tendency of many cadres who did not care about the development of production and only pursued one-sided welfare has been repeatedly criticized, which is completely necessary. However, some cadres therefore do not care about the lives of employees, do not make efforts to improve the wage system, do not implement the "Provisional Regulations on Rewards for Inventions, Technical Improvements and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production" already promulgated by the state, and even believe that giving material rewards to advanced producers and competition winners will promote the development of capitalist ideology. It should be pointed out that the idea of only requiring employees to increase production and save money but not caring about the lives of employees, and the idea of only wanting employees to work more and get less money, are as wrong as the idea of unilaterally demanding improvement in workers' lives while leaving the foundation of production development. "Pay according to work" and "more work, more pay" are by no means capitalist ideas. Only by resolutely implementing this principle can we give fuller play to labor enthusiasm and creativity and make the upsurge of labor competition rise higher.
    Since the announcement of the resolution of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on further developing labor competition, labor competition has achieved some new achievements. However, the Party, administrative, and trade union organizations in all departments and enterprises must further strengthen the leadership and organization of labor competition so that labor competition can be vigorously carried out and persisted in!

### 使劳动竞赛成为广大职工的群众运动

　　使劳动竞赛成为广大职工的群众运动
    劳动竞赛是发动工人群众的创造性和积极性进行社会主义建设的重要方法；是提高劳动生产率和改进生产的动力。为了保证国家建设计划的实现，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础，大力支援解放台湾的斗争，动员全体职工继续深入开展劳动竞赛，争取全面完成和超额完成国家计划，是社会主义企业中的党、行政和工会组织的重大政治任务。
    几年来，我国广大工人群众的劳动竞赛，在党的统一领导下有很大的发展。一九五○年全国参加劳动竞赛的职工有六十多万人；一九五四年仅河北、山东两省参加劳动竞赛的职工就有六十多万人。在劳动竞赛中，职工们对于改进技术、提高劳动生产率的问题普遍引起重视；劳动竞赛的组织领导工作也比较深入了。劳动竞赛的发展对于保证完成国家建设计划起了极为重要的作用。
    但是，还并非所有的企业都重视了劳动竞赛的工作。有些企业常年不组织劳动竞赛，有些企业只是在“五一”劳动节或十月国庆节前后为了突击任务才发动一次竞赛。就是在劳动竞赛比较经常的企业中，一般地也还缺乏深入的领导和具体的组织工作，因而仍有不少厂矿、不少车间、不少的小组和工人，不能按国家规定的各种经济指标完成任务；仍然有不少的先进经验没有总结和推广；劳动竞赛中还存在着偏重突击和拚体力的现象；安全生产的方针还没有认真贯彻，所以伤亡和设备事故仍然不断发生。这些事实说明，不少企业的领导人员，还极不重视群众的政治工作，或者还极不善于领导群众的政治工作，因而也就不能进一步发动广大职工的积极性和创造性，解决生产中的困难，推动生产向前发展。
    劳动竞赛在工业企业中的主要目标之一是提高技术水平，克服目前我国工业技术落后的严重状态。一九五四年四月，中华全国总工会根据鞍山钢铁公司的经验，作了关于在全国范围内开展技术革新运动的决定，把技术革新运动作为提高当前劳动竞赛的主要内容。技术革新运动的开展，对于推动广大工人群众学习和掌握新技术是起了一定的作用，并且也收到了一些成效，这是应该肯定的。但是技术革新的口号并不能适应于一切工业企业，并且在迫切需要提高工业技术水平的企业中，也不能适应于一切职工。因此，这些提法在劳动竞赛的发展过程中就产生了一些混乱的现象和不良的影响。不久以前，中华全国总工会经过检查，认为“开展技术革新运动”、“把技术革新运动作为提高当前劳动竞赛的主要内容”等提法是不确切、不完善的，应该停止这些提法。这是完全必要的和正确的。
    我国工业企业的设备和技术条件是极为复杂的。在一些新建的企业和用苏联最新设备扩建和改建的企业中，全体职工当前的任务，主要是如何学习苏联，提高技术、掌握技术，使现有设备发挥其应有效能。在一些设备和技术条件比较落后的现有企业中，为了进一步提高生产，也不都是要改进现有生产设备的结构或生产技术过程。“技术革新”这一口号含义既不够清楚，在技术革新运动开展之后，又缺乏具体的组织工作，因而就使得许多群众只注意创造发明和技术改进，忽视学习和掌握苏联的先进技术经验、忽视总结和推行我国已有的行之有效的先进经验。可是发明创造是少数人的事，多数人是不能发明创造的。而劳动竞赛则是多数人的事，甚至是具有全民性质的事，必须使劳动竞赛成为广大职工的群众运动。这是一切企业领导工作人员的迫切的政治任务。
    当然，改变关于技术革新的提法，决不是说不要革新我们的技术，决不是说对于工人的发明创造和各种合理化建议可以采取漠不关心的态度。相反的，在现有基础上不断提高工业技术水平，逐步掌握现代工业的新技术，正是我国实现社会主义工业化的一个重要条件。因此，在劳动竞赛中必须有领导地有组织地动员广大职工，积极学习和掌握新技术，努力改进和提高技术，特别是认真学习和推广苏联的先进技术经验。
    当前劳动竞赛的主要内容是什么呢？这不能作出统一的规定。各地、各产业系统、各企业应当根据具体情况和工人群众的要求，采取切合实际的内容和形式。例如在基本建设中应该以提高技术、保证工程质量和减低工程造价作为劳动竞赛的目标。在冶炼和机器生产企业中，应该以试制新的产品、增加新的品种为竞赛目标；在煤、油生产企业中，则应努力增加产量；在纺织工业和轻工业部门就应该在保证和提高质量的前提下，努力节约各种原材料，生产更多的物美价廉的产品。在交通运输部门中应该把加速车辆和船舶的周转、提高设备利用率、提高运输质量、降低运输成本作为劳动竞赛的重要目标。在国营商业和合作社商业中，应该把降低商品流转费用作为劳动竞赛的重要目标。
    为了更广泛地更经常地动员全体职工开展劳动竞赛，企业中的党、行政和工会组织应该积极关心职工群众的生活，特别是要贯彻正确的工资制度和劳动奖励制度，这是促进劳动竞赛的重要物质基础。过去几年反复批判了许多干部不关心生产的发展、只追求片面福利的经济主义倾向，这完全是必要的。可是，有些干部却因此就不关心职工的生活、不努力改善工资制度，不执行国家已经颁布的“有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”，甚至认为给先进生产者和竞赛优胜者以物质奖励就会助长了资本主义思想的发展，应该指出，那种只要求职工增产节约却不关心职工生活的思想，那种只愿意让职工多做工少拿钱的思想，是和离开生产发展的基础而片面要求改善工人生活的思想同样错误的。“按劳计酬”、“多劳多得”，这决不是资本主义思想。只有坚决贯彻这个原则，才能更高度地发挥劳动积极性和创造性，使劳动竞赛的热潮高涨起来。
    全国总工会主席团关于进一步开展劳动竞赛的决定公布以后，劳动竞赛已取得了一些新的成就。但是，各部门和各企业的党、行政和工会组织，还必须进一步加强领导和组织劳动竞赛，使劳动竞赛蓬勃地开展起来，坚持下去！
