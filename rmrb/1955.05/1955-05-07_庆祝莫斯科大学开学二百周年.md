　　Celebrating the Bicentennial of the Founding of Moscow University
　　Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University
　　Today is the bicentennial anniversary of the founding of Moscow University. All teachers, students, and staff of Peking University warmly celebrate this extremely significant festival, congratulate Moscow University on the brilliant achievements it has made in the past two hundred years, and wish it even more outstanding contributions to the great cause of Soviet communist construction in the future.
　　Moscow University was established in 1755 at the initiative of Lomonosov. Lomonosov was a genius scholar with extremely broad knowledge. He was a physicist, chemist, astronomer, geographer, geologist, mineralogist, linguist, historian, artist, and poet. As Pushkin's verse says: "Lomonosov embraced all civilization!" Moscow University has historically been the center of Russian science and education. The great Russian poet Lermontov, the great Russian literary critic and democratic revolutionary Belinsky, the great Russian writer Chekhov, the outstanding Russian physiologist Sechenov, and the "father of Russian aviation" Zhukovsky all studied or worked at Moscow University. Many outstanding scientists and experts in the Soviet socialist and communist construction were also trained by Moscow University.
　　Moscow University is a model for China's comprehensive universities and a model for our Peking University. The deep, brotherly friendship between our two universities is being consolidated and developed day by day. Comrade Gumachenko, one of the first Soviet experts to work at our university after the readjustment of our departments in October 1952, was a professor of political economy at Moscow University. During his time at our university, he trained teachers of political economy for Peking University and many other institutions of higher learning across the country, and served as a consultant to the president, guiding the teaching reform work of our university. Last October, Academician Petrovsky, the president of Moscow University, visited our university and personally brought many valuable gifts from Moscow University to our university, including 149 books of natural science and social science papers, collections, and textbooks written by Moscow University teachers; 78 kinds of rock specimens, mineral specimens, and soil profile specimens; 100 kinds of plant specimens; and five sets of Moscow University campus scene pictures. During Academician Petrovsky's visit, the two universities also agreed on several ways to establish direct contact. According to this method, the two universities can exchange school work plans, teaching and research office work plans, experience and other teaching materials. Academician Petrovsky also introduced in detail the teaching and scientific research work of various departments of Moscow University to our university, which pointed out a clear direction for our future work. Since our university established direct contact with Moscow University, we have successively received teaching materials sent by Moscow University, including teaching plans and teaching outlines for the eight departments of history, philosophy, language and literature, journalism, law, physics, chemistry, and biology, as well as personal study plans for graduate students, scientific research plans, etc., and 19 kinds of law textbooks such as the history of the Soviet state and legal rights, Soviet civil law, and Soviet criminal law. Our teachers were very excited after receiving these valuable materials. Each department organized translation forces as soon as possible to carry out translation work in a planned way. As of now, the Department of Philosophy, the Department of Law, and the various Departments of Language and Literature have translated more than 30 copies of teaching plans and teaching outlines. At present, comprehensive universities across the country are actively formulating or revising teaching outlines, and they urgently need to obtain the teaching outlines of Moscow University for reference. For example, the "Production Practice" outline of the Department of Physics, the "Physicochemical Analysis" outline of the Department of Chemistry, and the "General Entomology" outline of the Department of Biology are not only urgently needed by our university, but also urgently needed by other comprehensive universities across the country. These materials will be promoted by the Ministry of Higher Education to universities across the country in a timely manner. In addition, a regular communication connection has been established between the presidents of Moscow University and Peking University. Through correspondence, we have learned about the situation of Moscow University in detail. This assistance from Moscow University to Peking University has a great guiding and promoting role not only for Peking University but also for the teaching reform work of comprehensive universities across the country and the teaching work of teachers.
　　In order to celebrate the bicentennial of the founding of Moscow University, and to express the deep friendship of Peking University to Moscow University, our university presented the following gifts to Moscow University: a pair of large vases with a half-length portrait of Lomonosov painted on them; a piece of our country's famous special handicraft—wool embroidery, embroidered with colored wool threads depicting the new campus of Moscow University standing on Lenin Hills; and a set of "Sibu Congkan" (Collected Works in Four Sections) first edition and a set of "Twenty-Four Histories," a total of more than 2,900 volumes, which are very important reference books for the study of Chinese history and literature.
　　The bicentennial of the founding of Moscow University is a festival of Soviet science and culture, and also a major event in the cultural life of the Soviet people. Today, this meaningful day is being warmly celebrated at Moscow University, and all teachers, students and staff of our Peking University are also rejoicing. Our university held a scientific discussion on the May 4th anniversary of the school to examine the results of our university's study of advanced Soviet science, the development of scientific research, and the criticism of bourgeois idealist academic thought. We congratulate Moscow University on the festival with this action. We all clearly understand that the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow, and Moscow University's today is the tomorrow of our comprehensive universities across the country, and also the tomorrow of our Peking University. At present, our university is making great efforts to strengthen its work in all aspects, carry out teaching reform, improve teaching quality, develop scientific research and academic ideological criticism, and unswervingly move forward along the road of socialism!

　　庆祝莫斯科大学开学二百周年
　　北京大学校长　马寅初
    今天，是莫斯科大学开学二百周年纪念日。北京大学全体师生员工热烈地庆祝这个极有意义的节日，庆贺莫斯科大学二百年来所取得的光辉成就，并预祝它在今后对苏联伟大的共产主义建设事业作出更卓越的贡献。
    莫斯科大学是在洛蒙诺索夫的倡议下，于一七五五年建立的。洛蒙诺索夫是一个具有极广博的学识的天才学者。他是物理学家、化学家、天文学家、地理学家、地质学家、矿物学家、语言学家、历史学家、美术家和诗人。正如普希金的诗句所说：“洛蒙诺索夫怀抱着一切文明！”莫斯科大学在历史上是俄罗斯科学和教育的中心。伟大的俄罗斯诗人莱蒙托夫，伟大的俄罗斯文学批评家和民主主义革命家别林斯基，伟大的俄罗斯作家契诃夫，杰出的俄国生理学家谢切诺夫，“俄罗斯航空之父”茹可夫斯基，都在莫斯科大学学习或工作过。在苏联社会主义和共产主义建设事业中许多优秀的科学家和专家，也都是莫斯科大学培养出来的。
    莫斯科大学是中国综合性大学的榜样，是我们北京大学的榜样。我们两校之间兄弟般的深厚的友谊正日益巩固和发展。一九五二年十月我校院系调整后，最早来我校工作的苏联专家之一，古马青珂同志，就是莫斯科大学的政治经济学教授。他在我校工作期间曾为北京大学和全国许多高等学校培养了政治经济学的师资，并担任校长顾问，指导了我校的教学改革工作。去年十月，莫斯科大学校长彼得罗夫斯基院士曾来我校访问，并亲自带来莫斯科大学赠送我校的许多珍贵的礼物，计有莫斯科大学教师所著的自然科学和社会科学论文、专集、教科书籍等图书一百四十九册；岩石标本、矿物标本、土壤剖面标本等共七十八种；植物标本一百种；莫斯科大学校景图片五套。在彼得罗夫斯基院士访问期间，两校还商定了建立直接联系的几项办法。根据这个办法，两校可以互相交换学校工作计划，教研室工作计划、经验及其它教学资料。彼得罗夫斯基院士还向我校详细地介绍了莫斯科大学各系的教学和科学研究工作的情况，这给我校今后的工作指出了明确的方向。自我校同莫斯科大学建立直接联系以来，我校已陆续收到莫斯科大学寄来的教学资料，包括历史、哲学、语言文学、新闻、法律、物理、化学、生物八个系的教学计划、教学大纲、研究生个人学习计划、科学研究计划等，还有苏联国家和法权历史、苏联民法、苏联刑法等法律学教科书十九种。我校教师们收到这些宝贵的资料后，都甚为兴奋。各系都尽速组织翻译力量有计划地进行翻译工作。截至目前为止，哲学系、法律系及各个语言文学系已译出教学计划和教学大纲三十余份。目前全国各综合性大学都正在积极地制定或修订教学大纲，都迫切地需要得到莫斯科大学的教学大纲以资借镜，例如物理系的“生产实习”大纲，化学系的“物理化学分析”大纲，生物系的“普通昆虫学”大纲等等，不但为我校所急需，而且也为全国其他综合性大学所迫切需要，这些资料都将由高等教育部及时向全国各大学推广。另外，莫斯科大学和北京大学两校校长之间已建立经常的通信联系，通过信件来往，我们详细地了解到莫斯科大学的情况。莫斯科大学对北京大学的这些援助，不仅对北京大学，而且对全国各个综合性大学的教学改革工作，以及教师们的教学工作都有极大的指导和推动作用。
    为了祝贺莫斯科大学开学二百周年，为了表达北京大学对莫斯科大学的深厚的友谊，我校赠送莫斯科大学下列礼物：大花瓶一对，上面绘着洛蒙诺索夫的半身像；我国著名的特种手工艺品——毛绣一幅，用彩色毛线绣绘着矗立在列宁山上的莫斯科大学的新校舍；四部丛刊初编一部和二十四史一部，共二千九百多册，这是研究中国历史和文学的很重要的参考书。
    莫斯科大学开学二百周年，是苏维埃科学和文化的节日，也是苏联人民文化生活中的一件大事。今天，在莫斯科大学正热烈地庆祝着这个有意义的日子，我们北京大学的全体师生员工也莫不欢欣鼓舞。我校在今年五月四日校庆日举行了科学讨论会，检查了我校学习苏联先进科学开展科学研究以及批判资产阶级唯心主义学术思想的成果。我们以这个行动来祝贺莫斯科大学的节日。我们都清楚地了解，苏联的今天，就是我们的明天，而莫斯科大学的今天，就是我们全国各综合性大学的明天，也是我们北京大学的明天。目前，我校正在作巨大的努力，从各方面加强工作，进行教学改革、提高教学质量、开展科学研究和学术思想批判，坚定不移地沿着社会主义的道路前进！
