　　Why is Machinery Sleeping?
　　Mei Fengxiang
　　In recent years, various forest areas have been vigorously developing the mechanization of timber production; however, in the nationally renowned Yichun forest area, a large number of accumulated machinery has appeared.
　　According to the results of an inspection by the Ministry of Forestry's inspection team, as of April 15, 1955, the Yichun Forestry Industry Bureau had accumulated machinery and equipment, including 14 various power generation equipment, 90 various electric saws, 128 "Halin" chainsaws, 26 "Allis-Chalmers" tractors, 31 various cranes, 2 cars, 100 platform cars, and 2 oil tanks, with a total value of 3,489,700 yuan.
　　Why has such a large accumulation of machinery occurred?
　　This is mainly because the former Northeast Forestry Industry Administration and the Yichun Forestry Industry Bureau did not properly implement the policy of actively and steadily developing mechanization, and blindly pursued mechanization. They did not develop practical long-term plans for the use of mechanization based on forest area resources, annual timber production tasks, and operating methods. When preparing annual basic construction plans, they also failed to conduct detailed investigations into the efficiency of various equipment based on the characteristics of forest area operations. They did not invest under the guidance of the idea of rational use of funds, but rather with the idea of "better to have too much than not enough," feeling that as long as the higher authorities approved the request for funds, the matter was settled. In 1953, 53 "Ke-5" electric saws were imported, but because the corresponding frequency power station was not ordered, they have been stockpiled and unable to be put into production until now. In the same year, 131 "Halin" chainsaws were imported, but because corresponding spare parts such as saw chains, ball bearings, power chains, and saw sharpeners were not imported, after being put into production, the worn parts could not be replaced, and they had to be left idle.
　　Before purchasing various mechanical equipment, there was a lack of proper usage plans and a failure to train corresponding technical personnel. As a result, many devices have been accumulating for a long time because there are no people to operate them. For example, the Yichun Forestry Industry Bureau imported 90 various electric saws in 1953, but has not yet trained loggers who can master electric saw technology. In 1954, 26 "Allis-Chalmers" tractors were imported, but due to a lack of technical mastery, costs were high, production efficiency was low, and they were also idled this year. The 26 truck cranes imported this year are also idle and unused for the same reason. Now these mechanical equipment are piled up in the yard, exposed to the elements.
　　Currently, the Yichun Forestry Industry Bureau's subordinate forest industry bureaus have 37 various power stations, 98 various electric saws, and 131 "Halin" automatic chainsaws. With such a large number of power stations and electric saws, it is entirely possible to mechanize some of the logging work. However, for the past three years, the Yichun Forestry Industry Bureau has still used manual labor for heavy labor processes. In 1955, the Bureau planned to use electric saws to cut 8,800 cubic meters of timber, accounting for only 3.57 percent of the total cutting task. According to the results of experiments at the No. 1 Logging Site of the Ministry of Forestry's Dailing Forestry Industry Experimental School, one "Ke-5" electric saw can cut 60 cubic meters of timber per day, and 8,800 cubic meters of timber can be completed by one electric saw in just six months. This shows that 96.43 percent of the logging tasks in the Yichun forest area this year are still carried out manually, which obviously means that a large number of electric saws and power stations will continue to be stockpiled. The imported winch, which is a good tool for collecting materials, has also not been used. Various forest industry bureaus have 32 gantry-type loading machines and 26 truck-mounted loading machines, but manual labor is still largely used for loading work in mountain ridges, middle ridges, and log yards.
　　Many staff members in the Yichun forest area believe that mechanization is difficult to manage, and the cost of using machinery is high, so it is better to use animal power. This is completely wrong. In 1954, the production cost per cubic meter of timber produced by machinery was 1.297 yuan, while the production cost per cubic meter produced by animal power was 1.519 yuan. This fact shows that mechanized production not only ensures the reduction of heavy physical labor, but also ensures the reduction of timber production costs.
　　Precisely because some staff members have an attitude against mechanization, they do not seriously study scientific methods of managing machinery, but instead manage machinery in the same way they manage cattle and horses. For example, some machinery is used in winter and then taken down the mountain for repairs in the spring, resulting in long periods of idleness. Due to poor maintenance and repair work, three power stations, eight electric saws, six tractors, and two power stations have been damaged in the past three years, resulting in a loss of 268,400 yuan.
　　The leading staff of the Yichun Forestry Industry Bureau have adopted a "see no evil" attitude towards the large-scale accumulation of machinery and have not taken active measures, which shows that their sense of responsibility is very poor. The Ministry of Forestry should also bear some responsibility for blindly approving plans in the past without conducting in-depth investigations and research at the grassroots level.
　　The above is only the loss to the country caused by the accumulation and damage of machinery. As for the loss caused by the failure of machinery to be put into production and play its investment benefits, it is impossible to measure.
　　The Ministry of Forestry has now issued a circular on this matter, instructing various forestry industry bureaus to immediately check and correct this phenomenon.

　　机械为什么在睡觉
　　梅凤祥
    近年来，各林区正在大张旗鼓地发展木材生产机械化；而在名闻全国的伊春林区竟发生了大批积压机械的现象。
    据林业部检查组检查的结果，到一九五五年四月十五日为止，伊春森林工业管理局积压的机械设备，计有各种发电设备十四台、各种电锯九十台、哈林油锯一百二十八台、“阿特兹”拖拉机二十六台、各种起重机三十一台、汽车二辆、平台车一百辆、油罐两台，价值共计三百四十八万九千七百元。
    为什么会造成这样大批机械积压的现象呢？
    这主要是由于原东北森林工业管理局和伊春森林工业管理局没有很好贯彻积极稳步发展机械化的方针，盲目地追求机械化。他们没有很好地根据林区资源和逐年木材生产任务量、作业方式等来制出切实可行的使用机械化的长远计划。在编制年度基本建设计划时，也不能很好地根据林区作业方式的特点，对各种设备的使用效能进行详细调查，在合理使用资金的思想指导下进行投资，而是抱着“宽打窄用、多多益善”的思想，只要上级批准达到了要钱目的就算完事。一九五三年进口“克五”电锯五十三台，因为没有相应地订购周波电站，一直积压到现在不能投入生产。同年进口的“哈林”油锯一百三十一台，由于没有相应进口锯链、滚珠、动力链、错锯机等各种零件，在投入生产后，磨损了的零件配不上，只得闲置一旁。
    在购置各种机械设备之前，缺乏正确的使用计划，没有相应地培养技术力量。以致许多设备因为没有操纵的人而长期积压。如伊春森林工业管理局一九五三年就进口各种电锯九十台，可是至今尚未培养出可以掌握电锯技术的采伐手。一九五四年进口“阿特兹”拖拉机二十六台，由于未掌握技术，使得成本高，生产效率低，今年也闲置起来了。今年进口的汽车起重机二十六台，也因为同样原因闲置未用。现在这些机械设备堆在院子里，任凭风吹雨打。
    目前伊春森林工业管理局所属各森林工业局，共有各种电站三十七台、各种电锯九十八台、“哈林”自动油锯一百三十一台。拥有这样大批的电站、电锯，是完全可以使一部分采伐工作机械化的。但三年来伊春森林工业管理局在繁重的劳动工序上仍然是用人力进行。一九五五年，管理局计划用电锯采伐八千八百立方公尺木材，只占全部采伐任务量百分之三点五七。根据林业部带岭森林工业实验学校第一伐木场试验结果，一台“克五”电锯每天可采伐六十立方公尺木材，八千八百立方公尺的木材只需一台电锯半年时间即可完成。这说明今年伊春林区百分之九十六点四三的采伐任务仍用人力进行，显然要使大批电锯、电站继续积压下去。进口的绞盘机是一种良好的集材工具，也没有被利用。各森林工业局有三十二台架杆式装车机和二十六台汽车式装车机，但在山楞，中楞、储木场的装车工作中仍然大部用人力进行。
  　伊春林区的很多工作人员认为：机械化不易管理，用机械成本高，不如用畜力。这是完全不对的。一九五四年用机械生产的木材每立方公尺的生产成本为一元二角九分七厘，而用畜力生产的每立方公尺为一元五角一分九厘。这一事实说明机械化生产不仅保证减轻了笨重的体力劳动，而且也保证了降低木材生产成本。
    正由于有些工作人员存在着反对机械化的态度，所以他们便不去认真钻研科学管理机械的方法，而是用管理牛马的方法来管理机械。例如，有些机械冬天使用，春天就下山检修，造成长期闲置现象。由于保养检修工作做得不好，三年来损坏了各种电站三台，烧毁了电锯八台、拖拉机六台、电站两台，损失达二十六万八千四百元。
    伊春森林工业管理局的领导工作人员，对大批机械积压的现象抱着“熟视无睹”的态度，一直没有采取积极措施，这说明他们的责任心是很差的。林业部过去不深入下层调查研究，只是盲目批准计划，也应负一定的责任。
    以上仅是机械积压和机械损坏给国家造成的损失，至于机械没有投入生产发挥投资效益所造成的损失，那更是无法计量的了。
    现在林业部已为此事发出通报，指示各森林工业局立即检查和纠正这种现象。
