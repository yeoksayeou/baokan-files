　　"Tightening the magic hoop" is useless
　　Yang Ye
　　Agricultural production cooperatives are production organizations where farmers implement unified management and collective labor. In order to establish the order of collective labor and to leverage the advantages of unified management, it is necessary to formulate labor discipline and maintain labor discipline. However, labor discipline must be formulated through democratic discussion by cooperative members, and it must be consciously and voluntarily maintained by the members themselves. It also requires certain preconditions before it can truly take effect. If one attempts to treat labor discipline as a "tightening magic hoop" to "control" the members, and attempts to maintain it solely through punishment, it will only arouse dissatisfaction among the members, reduce their labor enthusiasm, and make the cooperative's production and management more chaotic.
　　According to a report in the "Yunnan Daily": The First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Huajiao Township, Rongfeng County, Yunnan, is a key cooperative directly led by the county party committee. This cooperative had a poor peasant member named Tao Wenjun who missed four days of work in the cooperative because of family matters. The comrades of the county party committee did not analyze the reasons for the missed work, but decided to "operate" on Tao Wenjun to rectify labor discipline, "deducting fifty work points from him." Some party members and cooperative cadres felt that this was inappropriate; however, the comrades of the county party committee insisted on their own opinion and announced it at a general meeting of cooperative members. Tao Wenjun did not accept it, and the comrades of the county party committee held another general meeting of cooperative members, changing the deduction to only twenty work points. As a result, some cooperative cadres said: Now we have a way to control the members! Many new members became apprehensive. From then on, on the surface, the members' attendance at work was more "active" than before. The cadres of the county party committee were deceived by this superficial phenomenon, believing that relying solely on rewards and punishments could improve the cooperative's management, so they held another general meeting of cooperative members, awarding the previously deducted work points to two members, while also deducting work points from two other members. One of them was also a poor peasant who had missed a little work due to family difficulties and had asked for leave; he was physically weak and usually worked relatively slowly. The cooperative cadres did not analyze the reasons but criticized him; when he did not accept it, they deducted twenty work points from him. After the meeting, this member requested to withdraw from the cooperative; many members were also very dissatisfied with this deduction. However, the county and district cadres actually regarded this as "experience" and spread it to other agricultural production cooperatives.
　　The production situation in some new and expanded old cooperatives is indeed very chaotic, and order should be established as soon as possible. However, the reasons for the chaos must first be clarified, and appropriate measures must be taken based on the specific reasons. The main reasons for the current chaos in agricultural production cooperatives and the lack of enthusiasm among some members are: the production management work of the newly established and expanded agricultural production cooperatives has not yet been put on track, and issues such as production plans, labor organization, and labor remuneration calculations have not been well resolved; some cooperatives have not properly handled some specific issues related to the members' immediate economic interests; political and ideological education has not kept up in a timely manner; many new members are not yet familiar with and accustomed to the cooperative's system; and some poor peasant members still have some difficulties in their lives. To establish production order and improve the members' labor enthusiasm, these issues must first be resolved. If these issues are not resolved and one attempts to "control the members" through punishment, there will be no good results.

### “紧箍咒”是没有用的

　　“紧箍咒”是没有用的
　　杨叶
    农业生产合作社是农民实行统一经营、集体劳动的生产组织；为了建立集体劳动的秩序，为了发挥统一经营的优越性，必须制定劳动纪律、维护劳动纪律。可是，劳动纪律必须经过社员民主讨论制定，必须由社员自觉自愿地来维护它，并且要有一定的先决条件，它才能真正起作用。如果企图把劳动纪律当作“管住”社员的“紧箍咒”，企图用单纯处罚的办法来维护它，就只能引起社员的不满，降低社员的劳动积极性，使社里的生产、管理更加混乱。
    据“云南日报”报道：云南榕峰县花椒乡第一农业生产合作社，是县委直接领导的重点社。这个社有个名叫陶文君的贫农社员，因为家里有事，在社里误了四天工。县委的同志没有分析误工的原因，就决定从陶文君“开刀”整顿劳动纪律，“扣他五十个工分”。社里的一些党员和社干部认为这样做不妥当；县委的同志却坚持自己的主张，并在社员大会上宣布了。陶文君不接受，县委的同志又召开一次社员大会，改为只扣二十个工分。这样，有些社干部说：往后有办法管住社员了！许多新社员却提心吊胆了。从这以后，从表面看，社员们出工比以前“积极”了。县委的干部为这种表面现象所迷惑，认为光靠奖惩制度就能把社的经营管理工作做好，于是又召开了社员大会，把从前扣的工分奖给两个社员，同时又扣了两个社员的工分。其中有一个也是贫农，因为家庭生活困难，误了一点工，而且是请了假的；他身体弱，平时干活比较慢。社干部没有分析原因，就批评他；他不接受，就扣了他二十个工分。会后，这个社员要求退社；许多社员对于这样扣分也很不满意。可是，县区干部竟把这作为“经验”，传播到别的农业生产合作社去。
    有些新社和扩大了的老社，生产情况的确很混乱，应当赶快把秩序建立起来。可是，必须先把发生混乱的原因弄清楚，针对具体的原因，采取适当的办法。当前农业生产合作社发生混乱现象，有些社员生产不积极，主要原因是：新建和扩建的农业生产合作社的生产管理工作还没有上轨道，生产计划、劳动力的组织、劳动报酬的计算等问题没有很好地解决；有些社对有关社员切身经济利益的一些具体问题还没有处理好；政治思想教育工作也没有及时跟上；许多新社员对于社里的制度还不熟悉，不习惯；有些贫农社员在生活上还有一些困难。要建立生产秩序，提高社员的劳动积极性，就先要解决这些问题。如果这些问题没有解决，而企图用处罚的手段“把社员管住”，那是不会有任何好结果的。
