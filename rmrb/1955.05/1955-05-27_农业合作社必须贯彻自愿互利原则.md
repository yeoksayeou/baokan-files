Some rural workers, especially those in areas where policy violations have occurred during the rectification of agricultural cooperatives, hold a passive and resistant attitude towards publicizing and implementing the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. They believe that promoting the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit to farmers is "asking for trouble" and "slapping themselves in the face." The secretary of the Dafangshen Village branch in the first district of Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, kept a newspaper containing the announcement from the Provincial People's Committee regarding specific policies on cooperativization hidden in his pocket all day, refusing to show it to the cooperative members, fearing that they would demand to withdraw from the cooperative after understanding the policies. The Shijianfang Village and Yangmulinzi Village in the twelfth district kept the announcement from the Provincial People's Committee in their drawers for more than half a month without posting it.

Will publicizing and implementing the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit really lead to the disintegration of agricultural production cooperatives? Materials from other areas in the same county can illustrate that this is not the case. During the preparation for plowing and spring plowing, the eleventh district of Gaiping County rectified twenty-two cooperatives. The comrades responsible for rectifying the agricultural cooperatives first investigated and understood the specific problems existing within the cooperatives and the ideological state of the members. Then, they publicized the specific policies of mutual aid and cooperation in response to these situations and problems. Afterwards, they addressed the issues violating the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit during the establishment of the cooperatives, and reorganized the labor organization. As a result, the agricultural cooperatives did not disintegrate and collapse, but became more consolidated. The previously active members are now even more active, the previously wavering members are now relatively firm, and the previously backward members are now gradually becoming active. According to a survey of these twenty-two cooperatives, forty-four households of members originally requested to withdraw from the cooperative; after earnestly implementing the policies and rectifying the organization, only two households withdrew, and the remaining forty-two households were unwilling to withdraw. Before the policies were publicized and implemented, six households of members of the Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dacoyu Village requested to withdraw; although the remaining members did not request to withdraw, they were not enthusiastic about work. They were unwilling to come when the cooperative called for work, and even when they came, they were not enthusiastic. Member Cui Fuli worked for the cooperative during the day and secretly picked stones from his own land at night. After the policies were publicized and implemented, these problems were resolved. The original five or six households of members who wanted to withdraw no longer wanted to withdraw. Member Cui Xueqin had a piece of mountain land, and the actual yield in recent years was more than two thousand catties; but when assessing production during the establishment of the cooperative last year, he was only assessed six hundred and twenty catties based on the soil quality. He felt that he was at a disadvantage at the time and was dissatisfied, but he did not dare to express his opinion, so he was not active in production and always thought about withdrawing from the cooperative. After publicizing and thoroughly implementing the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit and correcting the past unreasonable bias in assessing production, not only did he not request to withdraw from the cooperative, but his enthusiasm for production also increased, and he expressed that he would work hard in the future and be a good member.

These situations are enough to illustrate that only by earnestly implementing the Party's policies can cooperatives be run well. If the members still have many misunderstandings about the Party's policies, and the phenomena of violating the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit during the rectification of the cooperative are not corrected, it is fundamentally impossible to consolidate the cooperative by relying solely on pressure; even if it seems vigorous and lively on the surface for a while, problems will inevitably arise in the long run.

### 农业合作社必须贯彻自愿互利原则

    农业合作社必须贯彻自愿互利原则
    陈洪福
    有些农村工作人员，特别是在整顿农业合作社中发生违反政策现象的地区的工作人员，对宣传和贯彻自愿互利原则抱着消极对抗的态度。他们认为向农民宣传自愿互利原则是“自讨麻烦”，“自己打自己的嘴巴”。辽宁省盖平县第一区大房身村支部书记把一张登着省人民委员会关于合作化的具体政策的布告的报纸，整天藏在自己的口袋里，不给社员们看，怕社员懂得政策后要求退社。十二区十间房村和杨木林子村把省人民委员会的布告放在抽屉里，压了半个多月没有张贴。
    宣传和贯彻自愿互利原则真的会使农业生产合作社散伙吗？同一个县的另外一些地区的材料就可以说明，并不是这样的。盖平县十一区在备耕和春耕期间，整顿了二十二个社。负责整顿农业合作社的同志，首先调查了解了社内存在的具体问题和社员的思想情况，接着针对这些情况和问题宣传了互助合作的具体政策，然后根据政策处理了建社中违反自愿互利原则的问题，整顿了劳动组织。这样做的结果，农业合作社不是散伙垮台，而是更加巩固了。原先积极的社员现在更加积极了，原先动摇的社员现在也比较坚定了，原先落后的社员现在也逐渐积极了。根据这二十二个社的调查，原先有四十四户社员要求退社；经过认真贯彻政策和整顿组织以后，只有两户社员退社，其余的四十二户社员都不愿退社了。大曹峪村幸福农业生产合作社在没有宣传贯彻政策以前，有六户社员要求退社；其余的社员虽没有要求退社，但干活也不起劲，社里召集干活时都不愿来，就是来了，干活也不起劲。社员崔福利白天给社里干活，晚间还悄悄地到自己的土地上拣石头。经过宣传贯彻政策以后，这些问题都解决了。原先想退社的五、六户社员，都不退了。社员崔学勤有块山地，近几年的实产量是两千多斤；去年建社评产时只按土质给他评了六百二十斤。他当时感到吃亏，不满意，但不敢提意见，生产不积极，老想着退社。宣传和彻贯自愿互利原则、纠正了过去评产不合理的偏向以后，他不但不要求退社了，生产劲头也大起来了，并且表示今后要好好生产，做个好社员。
    这些情况足以说明：只有切实贯彻执行党的政策，才能使合作社办好。如果社员对党的政策还有许多误解，整顿社时违反自愿互利原则的现象不予纠正，单纯靠压力来巩固社，那是根本不可能的；即使在表面上一时闹得轰轰烈烈，久后也必然要出问题。
