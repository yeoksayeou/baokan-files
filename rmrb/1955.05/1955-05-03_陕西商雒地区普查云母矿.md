    To meet the needs of national industrial construction for mica, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Industry has extracted its main surveying and mapping forces this year to form the Shangluo Mica Prospecting Team. This team plans to focus on the Danfeng to Shangnan area from April to November this year, a total of seven months, to conduct a general survey of the mica deposits in the Shangluo area, in order to preliminarily understand the distribution range and geological conditions of mica deposits in the Shangluo area. The first batch of personnel from this team departed on April 7.
    In 1954, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Industry organized forces to conduct a preliminary survey of the mica deposits in the Qinling Mountains in the Shangluo area. At the same time, the Shangluo Asbestos Mine was reorganized into the Shangluo Mica Trial Mining Team for trial mining. According to preliminary understanding, within the area stretching over one hundred li from east to west and over fifty li from north to south in the northern part of Shangnan to Danfeng, there are widespread pegmatite veins and mica deposits.

　  陕西商雒地区普查云母矿
    为适应国家工业建设对云母的需要，陕西省工业厅今年抽出主要勘测力量，组成商雒云母普查队。这个队准备在今年四月到十一月的七个月间，以丹凤至商南地区为重点，对商雒一带的云母矿藏进行普查，以初步了解商雒地区云母矿的分布范围和地质情况等。这个队第一批人员已于四月七日出发。
    陕西省工业厅在一九五四年就曾组织力量对商雒一带秦岭山脉中的云母矿藏进行了初步调查。同时，把商雒石棉矿改组为商雒云母试采队进行试采。据初步了解，在商南至丹凤的北部东西长百多里、南北宽五十多里的地区内，普遍有伟晶岩脉和云母蕴藏着。
