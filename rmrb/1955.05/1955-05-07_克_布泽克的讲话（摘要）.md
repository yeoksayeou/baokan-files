　　K. Buzek's Speech (Summary)
    Today, all peace-loving people around the world are solemnly commemorating the centenary of the death of the great Polish national poet, Adam Mickiewicz. In Poland, the homeland of this great prophet and revolutionary poet, this fact is accepted by the public as an honor and as a sense of responsibility arising from it.
    The publication of Mickiewicz's early poems marked a new era in Romantic literature, which had similarities in the literatures of our Eastern and Western neighbors. This was a direction that brought the hidden resistance against national and social oppression to the surface of literary life. This is why the themes of Mickiewicz's even early poems were all taken from folk songs, written in everyday language, and essentially reflected the perspective of the peasants.
    The steady development of Mickiewicz's thought followed a typical path similar to that of almost every great revolutionary. This path began with various secret student organizations, followed by arrest and imprisonment, ending with a sentence of exile, which was intended to isolate the poet from his people. However, here, the oppressors were greatly mistaken. The Tsarist conquerors exiled Mickiewicz to Russia, but they rarely understood that it was they who personally threw him into the center of the European revolution of that time, among the Russian Decembrists. It was there, among them, that our poet's ideological understanding further grew and strengthened, and he himself was warmly welcomed by the leaders of the progressive groups of the Russian people. No matter how hard the Russian revolutionaries tried, they were still unable to attract the masses to participate in the revolution they organized. This is why they failed in 1825 - the uprising was brutally suppressed. The poem "Konrad Wallenrod" was written based on the impression of this failure. However, despite this, it once again raised the banner of revolution, showed contempt for the military power of the oppressors, and to a certain extent represented the Polish people in declaring: the need for a battle regardless of sacrifice, until victory is achieved.
    After the end and failure of the uprising in 1831, the opinions of many Polish expatriates who took refuge in France were by no means consistent. Among them were the extreme right wing followed by the Liberal Party, and people representing the lower social classes and the peasant masses. Mickiewicz found himself caught up in a vortex of political debate; the poet became a politician and political commentator. His activities in political life during his exile were in fact an excellent training for this poet and revolutionary.
    Far away from his homeland, in political quarrels and ideological debates, Mickiewicz kept in his heart the unforgettable image of his homeland. He happily recalled his childhood, missed the recent past and the pure beauty of the country where he grew up.
    Due to his homesickness, we obtained the creation of the great national epic "Pan Tadeusz." This brilliant work has been translated into many foreign languages ​​and is a world-renowned masterpiece. This book has also been translated into Chinese.
    "Pan Tadeusz" is the poet's last great and brilliant work; after that, he wrote some meaningful poems of character criticism, which are true masterpieces of Polish lyric poetry.
    When Mickiewicz frequently published his passionate articles in the "People's Forum", the international workers' movement had more consistent indicators, which were all included in Marx and Engels' "Communist Manifesto". Mickiewicz, this idealist, lived in a country where a true bourgeois revolution had not yet begun but was still in the development stage. Therefore, he represented democratic revolutionary radicalism rather than socialist radicalism. Nevertheless, this view of society is clearly tending towards the latter direction. It is precisely because of this that Mickiewicz is closer to us. We feel close to him, not only because of his keen achievements, but also because his life is so full of sacrifice and patriotism. He hoped that the Anglo-French-Russian war could create a new opportunity to organize armed forces to liberate the motherland. This is why he went to the East in the summer of 1855.
    After Mickiewicz's death, several more riots occurred in Poland: the entire nation repeatedly tried to break the shackles of foreign oppression to liberate itself. It was not until recently that the Red Army's fatal blow ended the doomsday of Hitler's fascism that we achieved final liberation. In fact, the tenth anniversary of our liberation is almost exactly the hundredth anniversary of the death of our prophet. Today, the wishes of this long-ago poet are constantly becoming reality and have reached a point that he would have considered impossible. Mickiewicz once dreamed and hoped that his writings could enter the "cottage" like folk songs. It means that he hopes that humble ordinary people can recite his writings. When he strengthened the foundations of international revolutionism, he had no doubt that his writings would spread all over the world, and of course would spread here with progressive ideas. Today's gathering, as well as the Chinese translation of poems and "Pan Tadeusz", is a particularly touching memorial that symbolizes the unity of our two countries for us. Our two countries are so far apart, but our thoughts are so close.

　　克·布泽克的讲话（摘要）
    现在，全世界一切爱好和平的人民都在庄严地纪念伟大的波兰人民诗人——亚当·密茨凯维支的逝世一百周年。在波兰，在这位伟大的预言家和革命诗人的祖国，这一个事实是被当作一种荣誉，同时也是当作一种由此产生的责任感而为公众所接受的。
    密茨凯维支的最初诗作的出版，在我们东西方邻国文学上均有其类似点的浪漫主义文学里开创了新的纪元。这是一个把反对民族压迫和社会压迫潜藏的反抗力提到文艺生活的表层上来的方向。这就是密茨凯维支甚至最初的诗歌中，其主题之所以都是采自民歌，用日常语言写出，并在实质上反映了农民的观点的原因。
    密茨凯维支思想的稳步发展是走着几乎和每一个伟大革命家所走过的类似的典型道路的。这道路开始于学生的各种秘密组织，接着是逮捕和入狱，终至以被判流放的刑罚而结束，这一刑罚原是着意在要把这位诗人和他的人民隔绝的。然而，在这里，压迫者是大错而特错了。沙皇的征服者们把密茨凯维支放逐到俄罗斯，而他们却绝少懂得正是由他们亲自把他投进那个时期的欧洲革命的中心，俄罗斯的十二月党人当中去了。正是在那里，在他们中间，我们这位诗人的思想认识进一步得到了成长和坚定，而且他本身也得到了俄罗斯人民的进步团体的领袖们的最热诚的欢迎。无论俄国革命者作了多少努力，但他们还是没有能够把人民群众吸引到来参加他们所组织的革命。这就是在一八二五年他们所以失败的原因——起义被残酷地镇压下去了。“康拉德·华伦洛德”一诗即是根据这次失败的印象写成的。可是，虽然如此，它还是再一次高举了革命的旗帜，对压迫者的军事力量予以藐视，并且在一定程度上代表着波兰人民宣称：需要一种不顾牺牲的战斗，直至胜利的取得。
    在一八三一年起义的尾声和失败之后，避难法国的许多波兰侨民的意见也决不是一致的。他们中间有自由党派追随的极右派，也有代表下层社会人和农民大众的人士。密茨凯维支发现自己卷入了政治论争的漩涡里；诗人变成了一个政治家和政论家。他在流亡时期的政治生活中的活动对于这位诗人和革命家实则是一种卓越的锻炼。
    在离开祖国遥远的地方，在政治的争吵和思想的争论中，密茨凯维支在心中保持着难以忘掉的祖国的形象，他愉快地回忆着他的童年，怀念着新近的过去和他生长成人的国家的纯正美丽。
    由于他的思乡，我们获得了那部伟大的民族史诗“在立陶宛的最后的袭击”的创作。这部灿烂的作品译成了许多种外文，是一本举世闻名的大著，这部书也译成了中文。
    “在立陶宛的最后的袭击”是诗人最后一部伟大而灿烂的著作；之后他又写了一些意味深长的人物批评诗，这些都是波兰抒情诗中的真正杰作。
    当密茨凯维支经常在“人民论坛”发表他热烈的文章时，国际工人运动已有了更加一致的指标了，这些都包括在马克思和恩格斯的“共产党宣言”中。密茨凯维支这位观念论者生活在一个真正的资产阶级革命尚未开始而依旧在发展阶段的国家内，因此他代表的是民主革命的而还并不是社会主义性质的激进主义。尽管如此，这种对社会的看法很显然是倾向于后者的方向。正是由于这样，密茨凯维支更加接近了我们。我们对他感到亲切，不仅是因为他的机敏的功绩，同时因为他的生命是那样的充满着牺牲和爱国主义的精神。他希望英法俄战争能造成一个新的机会得以组织武装力量使祖国获得自由。这就是他所以在一八五五年的夏天到东方去的原因。
    密茨凯维支去世以后，波兰又发生了几次暴动：整个民族一再努力要从异族的压迫下击破束缚的锁链来解放自己。直到不久以前由于红军致命的打击结束了希特勒法西斯的末日，我们才获得最后的解放。事实上，我们解放的十周年几乎正是我们的先知者逝世的一百周年。今天，这位很久以前的诗人的愿望正在不断地成为事实，并且已经达到想来是他所认为不可能达到的境地。密茨凯维支曾经梦想和期望他的著作能像民歌一样的进入“茅屋”里去。意思是说他希望谦恭的老百姓能传诵他的著作。当他加强了国际革命主义的基础，他毫不怀疑他的著作将会流传到全世界，当然会同样地随着进步的思想而流传到这里。今天的聚会以及中文翻译的诗和“在立陶宛的最后的袭击”，对我们来说，是象征着我们两国团结的特别动人的纪念。我们两国相距得这样遥远，但是，我们的思想却是这样的接近。
