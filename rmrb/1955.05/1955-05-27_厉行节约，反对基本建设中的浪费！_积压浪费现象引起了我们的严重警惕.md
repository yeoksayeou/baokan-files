　　Practice Thrift, Oppose Waste in Capital Construction!
　　Accumulation and Waste Phenomena Have Aroused Our Serious Vigilance
　　Yang Ligong, First Deputy Director of the Tractor Manufacturing Plant
　　The tractor factory is currently conducting a comprehensive mass inspection to oppose accumulation and waste. According to preliminary inspections, serious accumulation and waste exist in the preparatory work, whether in site surveys, engineering preparation, engineering supervision, or other preparatory expenses. According to incomplete statistics, the total value of accumulation and waste in 1954 reached 1,585,668 yuan, of which 970,782 yuan was accumulated and 614,886 yuan was wasted.
　　The fundamental reason for the waste is our mindset of emphasizing progress over thrift, believing that practicing thrift would hinder the construction progress. To complete such a large project on schedule, waste is considered unavoidable. Under this guiding ideology, practices that bypassed basic construction procedures were adopted. For example, site surveys were conducted before the plant area layout was available; materials were prepared before the technical design, or even before the preliminary design, was completed; construction was carried out without construction drawings, budgets, or contracts. This led to a series of passive, chaotic, and wasteful situations. Originally, based on the requirements of the overall construction schedule and on-site conditions, it is unavoidable and acceptable for certain secondary engineering projects to be arranged and carried out in a cross-cutting manner procedurally, with certain procedures and measures taken. However, if this exceeds the scope allowed by objective laws, and planning and organization of various tasks are relaxed, the meticulous calculation of investment in various tasks is relaxed, and projects that should not be carried out in a cross-cutting manner are carried out in a cross-cutting manner, serious accumulation and waste will result. In temporary construction, such as roads and parking lots, construction began before the design was available, resulting in 24,200 square meters more than designed. Adding the parking lot, which also exceeded the designed area, a total of 180,000 yuan was wasted. Construction of the railway special line began before the design was available, resulting in laying 5 centimeters thicker of gravel than designed, wasting 3,500 yuan. In the semi-permanent dormitory buildings in temporary construction, construction began before the urban plan was finalized, resulting in incorrect positioning, construction and demolition at the same time. The demolition loss alone amounted to 11,222 yuan. This not only wasted state resources but also delayed the completion time of the houses. In the temporary water supply project, due to construction exceeding the basic construction procedures, 840 meters of pipelines were mistakenly buried, wasting 1,900 yuan. Furthermore, for materials such as steel rails and sleepers, it is appropriate to order early to make temporary construction use permanent engineering materials. However, the needs of temporary construction should be carefully calculated and reserves should be based on actual needs. However, we did not do this and hastily estimated and reserved 13.5 kilometers of steel rails and sleepers based only on the outline of the drawings. As a result, only 8.5 kilometers were needed, and the materials for 5 kilometers of railway had to be accumulated. For standardized materials with large consumption, such as bricks, tiles, ash, sand, and stone, it is acceptable to buy them early; while some materials with small consumption and closely related to the design, such as sanitary equipment, gas pipes, welding pipes, and plywood, should not and do not need to be ordered in advance, exceeding the basic construction procedures, but we also purchased them all without analysis, resulting in accumulation.
　　A second reason for this accumulation and waste is that we one-sidedly understood the meaning of "large-scale" and "long-term plan," and did not distinguish between productive or ancillary construction, major or minor, permanent or temporary construction. Everything had to be "large-scale," and everything had to conform to "long-term plans." This idea is reflected in engineering in the form of high standards and large quotas. For the construction of a temporary small power plant, which was originally only intended to be used for three to five years, we used a semi-permanent brick and wood structure. This idea is reflected in the purchase of fixed and non-fixed assets, which is to be greedy for high-end, large, new, and expensive items. Everything had to be high-grade, large-scale, new-style, and large-quantity, and the price was used as the standard, believing that expensive is good, and buying whatever is expensive. Equipment was purchased for the nursery according to the needs of 200 children, resulting in equipment for about 60 children being accumulated for a long time. Tables, chairs, beds, and stools were not purchased gradually according to needs, but were purchased in large quantities and accumulated in large quantities. More than 600 desks alone were accumulated. Automatic noodle rolling machines, automatic computers, two high-grade parallel bars and three leather pommel horses worth 1,300 yuan, high-grade medical equipment worth 2,000 yuan, high-grade musical instruments worth 1,500 yuan, and travel radios worth 550 yuan each were all wasteful and inapplicable. For example, high-grade medical equipment cannot be effective due to the lack of other equipment to match. The waste caused by excessive material reserves is also serious. In 1954 alone, a total of 103 kinds of materials were reserved but not used, totaling 620,272 yuan, and the quantity of some materials prepared was dozens of times greater than the actual need. For example, 60 tons of steel bars for the pile cap of the railway bridge were purchased, but only 3 tons were actually needed.
　　The lack of thorough planning and organization, and the lack of strict financial and responsibility systems, are also important reasons for the serious waste. When preparing plans, there is a lack of sufficient investigation and research and comprehensive and practical consideration. Therefore, the planned projects are often incomplete, the planned time is often inaccurate, and the relationship between the various projects in the plan is often inconsistent and unconnected, especially the lack of specific and detailed operational plans. Because the plan is inaccurate, the implementation is not strict, and it is either easily changed or not followed. The annual plan for 1954 was revised six times, the last time in September. By the end of the year, only 91% of the work stipulated in the plan was completed, and some work outside the plan was done. After the planned tasks were determined, there was a lack of practical organizational arrangements corresponding to the planned tasks. The responsibilities of various functional institutions were not clearly divided, and strict responsibility systems were not established. Many tasks did not have responsible institutions or dedicated personnel responsible. The financial system and financial supervision are also not strict. The phenomenon of projects in the financial plan being used without being created, created without being used, used less and created more, and created less and used more is frequent and serious. Leaders often take care of so-called actual situations for expenditures that are not in the plan and do not conform to the system, and rarely adhere to financial systems and financial plans. In 1954, unplanned and unscheduled expenditures amounted to 689,300 yuan. This reduced the supervisory and control role of finance and promoted the development of unplanned and unorganized work. Due to the above reasons, many tasks are unbalanced and unconnected, with many loopholes, many problems, many urgent tasks, and many temporary measures. Often, work is suspended on one side and overtime is worked on the other; rework is done on one side and work is rushed on the other. The railway bridge stopped work waiting for drawings at the beginning, stopped work waiting for materials in the middle, and rushed work at the later stage. In 1954, the equipment for the temporary water supply project in the dormitory construction area was purchased piecemeal. After buying the well pipes, it was thought that a deep well pump was needed. After buying the deep well pump, it was forgotten to buy the motor. After buying the motor, it was forgotten to buy the belt and pulley. After the power equipment was complete, it was found that there was a shortage of water pipes... For this temporary project alone, emergency procurement personnel were dispatched six times. Accumulation caused by poor planning accounted for 39.4% of the total accumulation.
　　Most of the staff of the tractor factory are transferred from other jobs and lack experience. Organizing them to study their jobs in practical work is a very important task, but we have done poorly in this regard. When many tasks were started, we did not organize everyone to seriously discuss and study them. The people doing the work did not understand the purpose and significance of the work, let alone the specific content and procedures of the work. Many tasks were blindly explored, the procedures were reversed, what should have been done was not done, and what should not have been done was done first. For example, people preparing materials did not know the purpose of the materials, and did not know what specifications and performance were required, resulting in incorrect procurement and accumulation and waste. Construction units should cooperate with the construction units correctly and actively, and should also carry out strict supervision of the construction units, but many of our comrades mistakenly opposed cooperation and supervision. In order to maintain good relations, supervision was relaxed or abandoned, and even the established rules and regulations were not followed. Therefore, the accumulation and waste caused was also very serious. For example, for the semi-permanent dormitories in the temporary project, the state approved 10,000 square meters, but the construction unit built 14,600 square meters, and we did not ask about it. This alone wasted 223,792 yuan.
　　The tractor factory is basically still in the initial stage of construction. Accumulation and waste are already so serious. This has issued a warning to us: we must immediately be vigilant, analyze the reasons, learn from the lessons, and quickly find ways to improve. Otherwise, after the large-scale plant construction and installation projects begin, if we continue to do things in the old way, the losses will be incalculable.

### 厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！　积压浪费现象引起了我们的严重警惕

　　厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！
　　积压浪费现象引起了我们的严重警惕
　　拖拉机制造厂第一副厂长　杨立功
    拖拉机厂目前正在进行全面的群众性的反对积压浪费的检查。根据初步检查发现，在筹建工作中，无论是场地勘查、工程准备、工程监督和其他筹备费用的开支方面，都存在着严重的积压和浪费现象。据不完全的统计，一九五四年积压浪费的总值达一百五十八万五千六百六十八元，其中积压九十七万零七百八十二元，浪费六十一万四千八百八十六元。
    造成浪费的基本原因是我们存在着只重视进度忽视节约的思想，认为要保证建厂进度就不能厉行节约，要按期完成这样巨大的工程，浪费是不可避免的。在这种思想指导下，就采取了超越基本建设程序的做法。例如，还没有厂区的平面布置，就进行了厂房的勘查；技术设计还没到，甚至初步设计还没完成，就准备材料；施工图还没来，既没预算也没合同，就进行施工。因此就产生了一系列的被动、混乱和浪费。本来根据建厂总进度的要求，各项工作的安排和现场条件，某些次要的工程项目，经过一定的手续和采取一定的措施，在程序上交叉进行是难免的，也是可以的。但是如果超出了客观规律所容许的范围，放松了各种工作的计划和组织，放松了对各项工作投资的精打细算，把不应交叉进行的工程也交叉进行了，就会造成严重的积压浪费。暂设工程中公路和停车场，设计没到就施工，结果比设计多修了二万四千二百平方公尺，加上停车场也超过了设计面积，共浪费十八万元。铁路专用线设计没到就施工，比设计多铺了五公分厚的石子，浪费三千五百元。暂设工程中的半永久性的宿舍建筑，城市规划没定就施工，结果位置盖错，边建边拆，仅拆损费就达一万一千二百二十二元。不但浪费了国家的资财，还拖延了房子完工的时间。临时供水工程，因超越基本建设程序施工，错埋了八百四十公尺管道，浪费一千九百元。再如钢轨和枕木，为使暂设工程利用永久工程的材料，提前订货是应该的。但应切实计算暂设工程的需要，根据实际需要来储备。然而我们没有这样做，只根据图纸的轮廓就草率估计储备了十三公里半的钢轨枕木，结果只需要八公里半，只好把五公里铁路的材料积压起来。再如，用量较大的标准化的材料，如砖、瓦、灰、砂、石等，是可以早买的；而一些用量很少并与设计关系又较大的材料，如卫生器材、瓦斯管、焊接管、胶合板等，就不应该而且也不需要超越基本建设程序提前订购，但是我们也毫无分析地全部订购了来，结果也造成了积压。
    造成这种积压浪费的其次一个原因，是由于我们片面地理解了“大规模”和“百年大计”的意义，不分生产性或附属性建设，不分主要或次要，不分永久工程或暂设工程，一切都要“大规模”，一切都要符合“百年大计”。这种思想表现在工程方面是标准高，定额大。一座临时小电厂的建筑，本来只要能够使用三、五年就行了，我们却采用了半永久性的砖木结构。这种思想表现在固定资产和非固定资产的购置上，是贪高、贪大、贪新、贪贵，一切都要高级的、大型的、新式的、多量的，而且物以价高为标准，认为贵的就好，什么贵就买什么。托儿所按二百个儿童的需要购置了设备，结果约有六十个儿童的设备长期积压。桌、椅、床、凳，不是根据需要逐渐购置，也是大量购进大量积压，只写字台就积压了六百多张。购置的自动轧面机、自动计算机、一千三百元的两个高级双杠和三个皮木马、二千元的高等医疗器械、一千五百元的高级乐器、五百五十元一架的旅行收音机等，都是既浪费了资金又不适用的。如高等的医疗器械，因缺乏其他设备来配合，不能发挥效用。材料储备过多造成的浪费也是严重的。一九五四年一年中，备而不用的材料共达一百零三种，总值六十二万零二百七十二元，有的材料准备的数量竟大于需要数十倍。如铁路大桥的桩帽钢筋，实际需要三吨，却买了六十吨。
    缺乏周密的计划和组织工作，缺乏严格的财务制度和责任制度，也是造成严重浪费的一个重要原因。在编制计划时，缺乏充分的调查研究和全面切实的考虑，因此计划的项目往往不全，计划的时间也往往不准，计划中各个项目的关系也常常不一致，不衔接，尤其是缺乏具体详细的作业计划。由于计划不准，因此执行起来也不严格，不是轻易变更，就是不按计划办事。一九五四年年度计划修改了六次，最后一次是九月修订的，到年底，计划中规定的工作只完成了百分之九十一，另外，却做了一些计划以外的工作。当计划任务确定后，又缺乏与计划任务相适应的切实的组织安排，各个职能机构的职责没有划分清楚，也没有建立严格的责任制度，很多工作没有负责机构或专责人员负责。财务制度与财务监督也不严格，财务计划中的项目，用而不造，造而不用，用少造多，造少用多的现象是经常而严重的。领导上对计划里没有的和不合制度规定的开支，常常是照顾所谓实际情况，很少坚持财务制度和财务计划。一九五四年属于计划外和制度外的开支就达六十八万九千三百多元。这样，就减低了财务的监督和控制作用，助长了工作无计划无组织状态的发展。由于上述的原因，就使得很多工作不平衡不衔接，漏洞多，问题多，紧急任务多，临时措施多，常常是一边停工窝工，一边加班加点；一边返工，一边赶工。铁路大桥开始时停工待图，中间停工待料，后期又突击赶工。一九五四年宿舍工区临时供水工程的设备，零打碎敲，买到了井管才想到需要深井水泵，买到了深井水泵又忘了买马达，买到了马达又忘了买皮带和皮带盘，动力设备齐全了又发现缺少输水管……只此一项临时工程，就前后派出紧急采购人员六起。由于计划不周造成的积压，占积压总值的百分之三十九点四。
    拖拉机工厂的工作人员大都是转业来的，业务生，没有经验，组织他们在实际工作中钻研业务是一项很重要的工作，但我们在这方面做得很差。很多工作在开始进行时，没有组织大家认真地讨论研究，做工作的人不了解工作的目的和意义，更不了解工作的具体内容和程序，很多工作是盲目摸索，程序颠倒，该做的没有做，不该做的又先做了。如准备材料的人不知道材料的用途，不知道要求什么样的规格和性能，以致错提错购，造成了积压和浪费。建设单位应该同施工单位正确地积极地协作，同时应该对施工单位进行严格的监督，但我们不少同志错误地把合作同监督对立了起来。为了搞好关系，放松或放弃了监督，甚至不按已订的规章制度办事，因此造成的积压和浪费也是很严重的。如临时工程中的半永久性的宿舍，国家批准一万平方公尺，施工单位建了一万四千六百平方公尺，我们也没有过问。只此一项，就浪费了二十二万三千七百九十二元。
    拖拉机厂目前基本上还处在建厂的开始阶段，积压浪费已如此严重，这就向我们提出了一个警告：必须立即警觉起来，分析原因，接受教训，赶快设法改进，否则大规模的厂房建筑及安装工程开始后，仍照老样子办事，造成的损失将是不可估量的。
