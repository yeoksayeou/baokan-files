We must continue to work diligently, overcome difficulties, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the 1955 national plan, and strive to build our country into a great socialist country!

People from all walks of life must work together to strengthen national defense, oppose American imperialism's occupation of our sacred territory of Taiwan, and strive to liberate Taiwan and defend the security of the motherland!

We must unite closely with the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and all peace-loving people in the world to ease international tensions and safeguard peace in Asia and the world!
