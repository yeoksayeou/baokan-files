　　In Xishuangbanna
　　By our correspondent Liu Shiping
    Xishuangbanna is a place with a beautiful natural environment and abundant resources. Some people use poetic language to describe the tropical scenery there vividly, making it fascinating. This is indeed the case.
    The Xishuangbanna area covers 25,000 square kilometers. The plains are mostly alluvial, and the land is very fertile, a tempting black and oily color. In the past, under the oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the general farming habits of farmers were not to fertilize or weed, and the yield of rice per unit area was only more than 200 jin. In the past few years, under the promotion of the Autonomous Region Agricultural Technology Extension Station, farmers have begun to accumulate fertilizer, weed, and learn deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. In 1954, the yield of rice per unit area generally reached more than 390 jin, and some increased to more than 680 jin.
    This place has always been known as the "Granary of Southern Yunnan." According to climatic conditions, double-cropping rice can be planted. Because of the small population, only one crop was planted in the past, and the rice produced could not be eaten. In 1954, double-cropping rice was tested in a few dams and grew well. If the cultivation of double-cropping rice is universally promoted throughout the region in the future, and the wasteland is reclaimed to expand the planting of cash crops and tropical fruits, it will play a greater role in supporting the country's industrial construction and meeting the needs of the people's lives.
    The forests here are also very rich, with many precious and economically valuable trees. Bamboo forests are all over the mountains and fields, as thick as rafters. Most of the houses of the Dai people are built with bamboo. Various delicious tropical fruits are also produced here. The pasture in the mountains is evergreen all year round, and animal husbandry can also be developed.
      Dawn City
    Yunjinghong is the capital of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region. It means the City of Dawn.
    The people in this place suffered from the oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past. When it was first liberated, it was overgrown with weeds and desolate everywhere.
    In the past five years, Yunjinghong has undergone fundamental changes. Now, it is not only the political center of the Autonomous Region, but also the economic and cultural center. A Jingde factory that has never existed in history has been established. The bright electric light emitted from the factory illuminates this emerging city.
    Yunjinghong is on the Lancang River. The Lancang River flows through Xishuangbanna along the canyons of the Hengduan Mountains of the Yunling Mountains. The terrain of Yunjinghong is low-lying, and the altitude has dropped to more than 800 meters. The climate is humid and hot throughout the year. Even in the cold winter months, the climate at noon is similar to that of early summer in the north. Therefore, various plants grow luxuriantly and are evergreen in all seasons.
    The Beautiful Olive Dam
    Take a wooden boat from Yunjinghong down the Lancang River rapids to the Olive Dam. The terrain of the Olive Dam is lower than that of Yunjinghong, so when passing through the turbulent rapids in the steep cliffs, the small boat sways in the center of the river, follows the water patterns, and dodges the rocks, just like children riding a slide, sliding down. From a distance, only a boat as wide as a person can be seen flying down the turbulent Lancang River like an arrow. However, sitting on the boat, the river water splashes, and although it sometimes wets the clothes, one does not feel any danger.
    The Olive Dam has reached the border line. It is adjacent to Myanmar and is a place for producing tropical fruits. Here there are coconuts, bananas, plantains, pineapples, grapefruits, oranges, lychees, papayas, etc. Rubber, coffee, lemons, cinchona, betel nuts and other tropical plants can also be planted. There is also the industrial raw material lac, which is a wild plant called "Zi Geng" by the local Dai people. It can be used as raw material for paint, gramophone records, lithographic ink, insulators for electrical equipment, utensils, toys, buttons, etc. It can also be used as a sticky material for the shipbuilding industry. In the past, people did not know its use and discarded it on trees. Since 1954, trading companies have begun to purchase it, which has aroused the attention of local people.
    I lived in the Er Village, which produces coconuts, in the Olive Dam for three days. The tropical trees such as bodhi trees, banyan trees, and palm trees cover the sky and the sun, as if entering a forest area. Fresh coconuts are cool, sweet and refreshing, and each coconut sells for only 2 jiao and 5 fen. There are more than 70 coconut trees in 35 households in the village. This year, the coconut tree varieties here will be introduced and cultivated to expand planting in Yunjinghong and other places.
    Across the river from Er Village is Yi Village, where bananas are in groves. The bananas are thicker, larger, sweeter, and more fragrant than those in the interior, and six can be bought for one jiao. Because they cannot be transported out and the weather is hot, the farmers dry them into dried bananas to prevent them from rotting.
    In this village, I met an old man named Zeng Pei'an who grows bananas. He is fifty-nine years old this year, and his temples are already gray. He said: Before liberation, people were unwilling to grow bananas, because the bananas were snatched and eaten by the Kuomintang bandits before they were ripe, without giving a penny, and those who grew bananas had to pay taxes. The situation after liberation has completely changed. He originally had only twenty banana trees, but now he has two hundred.
    Border Trading Port - Menghai
    Menghai is 53 kilometers away from Yunjinghong. Its altitude is higher than that of Yunjinghong, generally above 1,200 to 1,300 meters. In Xishuangbanna, it is a relatively cool place. It produces the famous Pu'er tea and camphor and is a commercial center of Xishuangbanna.
    The Dai people live in the dam area of Menghai; the Hani people live in Nannuo Mountain and Suhu in the mountainous area. Xishuangbanna has a total population of more than 250,000, of which more than 120,000 are Dai people. The second largest minority group is the Hani people, with more than 30,000 people. Since liberation, under the principle of national equality, mutual assistance and mutual concession, the Dai and Hani people have united in the big family of an autonomous region, jointly developing production, and working hard for a happier life tomorrow.
    The large-leaf tea species in Yunnan tea are famous at home and abroad. This is its origin. In recent years, tea gardens and experimental fields across the country have come here to introduce planting. The tea experiment station and technology promotion station have also helped tea farmers improve their planting techniques. The tea produced here is not only supplied to the fraternal ethnic groups in Tibet but can also be exported, and the future development prospects are great.
    It is 786 kilometers from Kunming to Menghai. In the past, it often took half a year to receive a parcel from Kunming to Yunjinghong; it took at least twelve or thirteen days to send newspapers, periodicals, and books, and sometimes seventeen or eighteen days. After the opening of the Kunming-Luohe Highway, it only takes seven or eight days at most.
    The construction of the Kunming-Luohe Highway was shouted for more than 20 years during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, but the result was a waste of money and manpower and it was not completed. The fraternal ethnic groups along the route said: In the past, hoping for a highway was like hoping for a rooster to lay eggs, and they never saw a shadow of it. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, from September 1951 to December 1954, it only took about three years for cars to reach Menghai from Kunming.
    The fraternal ethnic groups living on the border line were happy to see the department store transporting more and better goods from the Kunming-Luohe Highway. They happily said: "In the past, we all thought that such good things could not be manufactured by our country. Now we have seen and bought cheap and good things made by our country ourselves; we have also seen things we have never seen before, and we have bought sewing machines made in Shanghai."
    Among the young people I have come into contact with, whether they are Dai or Hani, they all have a common wish: they want to be united in the big family of the motherland forever, build this beautiful and rich place, and move towards a socialist society together with other fraternal ethnic groups.

### 在西双版纳

　　在西双版纳
　　本报记者　刘时平
    西双版纳是一个自然环境优美物产丰富的地方。有的人把那里的热带风光，用诗一样的语言，描画得淋漓尽致，引人入胜。实际也确实如此。
    西双版纳全区面积有二万五千平方公里，平坝地区多为冲积平原，土地非常肥沃，黑油油的十分诱人。过去，在国民党反动统治的压榨、剥削下，一般农民的耕作习惯是不施肥，不除草，稻谷的单位面积产量只有二百多斤。几年来，在自治区农业技术推广站的推动下，农民已开始积肥、除草，学习深耕细作。一九五四年稻谷的单位面积产量一般已达三百九十多斤，有的提高到六百八十多斤。
    这里素有“滇南粮仓”之称，按照气候条件，可以种双季稻。因为人口少，过去只种一季，出产的稻谷吃不完。一九五四年，在少数坝子里试种双季稻，生长良好。如果今后全区普遍推行种双季稻，再把荒地开垦出来，扩大种植经济作物和热带水果，对支援祖国的工业建设和供应人民的生活需要，将会起更大的作用。
    这里的森林也很丰富，有许多名贵的和有经济价值的树木。竹林更是满山遍野，粗的如同椽子。傣族人民的住房，大半是用竹子盖的。这里还出产各种美味的热带水果。山区的牧草，四季常青，还可以发展畜牧业。
      黎明的城
    允景洪是西双版纳傣族自治区的首府。它的意思是黎明城。
    这个地方的人民，过去受尽了国民党反动派的压迫和剥削，刚解放的时候，到处野草丛生，一片荒凉。
    五年来，允景洪已经起了根本的变化。现在，它不但是自治区的政治中心，而且也成了经济和文化的中心。一个历史上从来没有的景德工厂建立起来了。从工厂里发出来的灿烂的电灯光，照耀着这个新兴的城市。
    允景洪在澜沧江边。澜沧江沿着云岭的横断山脉的峡谷，流经西双版纳。允景洪的地形低洼，海拔已降到八百多公尺，终年的气候都很湿热，即使十冬腊月，中午的气候，也和北方的初夏差不多。因此，各种植物生长茂盛，四季常青。
    美丽的橄榄坝
    从允景洪坐木船，顺澜沧江急流而下，就到橄榄坝。橄榄坝的地形，比允景洪还低，所以在峡谷陡壁间经过水流湍急的险滩时，小船荡漾江心，顺着水纹，躲过岩石，如孩子们坐滑梯一样，一滑而下。远看上去，只有一个人身宽的小船，在波涛汹涌的澜沧江里，如射箭一般飞下，可是坐在船上，江水四溅，有时虽溅得衣襟湿透，反不觉得有何危险。
    橄榄坝已经到了国境线上，它同缅甸相邻，是一个生产热带水果的地方。这里有椰子、香蕉、芭蕉、菠萝、柚子、橘子、荔枝、木瓜等等。还可以种植橡胶、咖啡、柠檬、金鸡纳霜、槟榔等热带植物。还有工业原料紫胶，它是一种野生植物，当地傣族人民叫做“紫梗”，可作油漆、留声机唱片、石印油墨、电工器材上的绝缘体、器皿、玩具、钮扣等的原料，还可做造船工业的粘补原料。过去人们不知道它的用途，弃之树上。从一九五四年起贸易公司开始收购，已经引起当地人民的重视。
    我在橄榄坝生产椰子的二村住了三天。那里的菩提树、榕树、贝叶树等热带树木，遮天蔽日，如入森林地带。新鲜的椰子清凉香甜，每个椰子只卖二角五分。全村三十五家人，有椰子树七十多棵。今年这里的椰子树品种将被引育到允景洪等地扩大栽种。
    同二村隔江相望的一村，香蕉成林。香蕉比内地的粗大而香甜，一角钱可买六个。因为运不出去，天气又热，农民们为了防止腐烂，就把它晒成香蕉干。
    我在这个村子遇到一位种香蕉的老人曾培安，他今年五十九岁，鬓发已经斑白。他说：解放以前，人们都不愿意种香蕉，因为香蕉还没熟，就被国民党匪帮们抢吃光了，不给一文钱，而种香蕉的人还要上捐纳税。解放以后的情况完全变了，本来他只有二十棵香蕉，现在已经有二百棵了。
    边疆的商埠——勐海
    勐海离允景洪五十三公里，海拔比允景洪高，一般在一千二、三百公尺以上，在西双版纳，它是比较凉爽的地方。这里出产闻名全国的普洱茶，还出产樟脑，是西双版纳的一个商业中心。
    在勐海的坝子里，聚居着傣族；在山地的南糯山和苏湖聚居着哈尼族。西双版纳共有二十五万多人口，其中傣族有十二万多人，人数比较多的第二个少数民族就是哈尼族，有三万多人。解放以后，在民族平等的原则下，互助互让，傣族人民和哈尼族人民已经团结在一个自治区的大家庭里，共同发展生产，为自己明天的更幸福生活勤奋地劳动着。
    云南茶叶中的大叶种是驰名国内外的。这里就是它的原产地。近年来，全国各地的茶园和试验场，纷纷到这里引种。茶叶试验场和技术推广站又帮助茶农改进了种植技术。这里产的茶叶除供应西藏的兄弟民族外，还可以外销，将来发展前途很大。
    从昆明到勐海有七百八十六公里。过去从昆明寄包裹到允景洪，经常要半年才收到；寄报刊、书籍最快也得十二、三天，有时要十七、八天。昆洛公路通车后，最多只要七、八天了。
    修昆洛公路，在国民党反动派统治时期曾经空喊了二十多年，结果是劳民伤财而没有修成。沿线的兄弟民族都说：过去盼公路如同盼公鸡下蛋一样，连个影子都没有盼到。解放以后，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，从一九五一年九月到一九五四年十二月，只用了三年左右时间，汽车就从昆明通到了勐海。
    住在国境线上的兄弟民族，看见百货公司从昆洛公路运来又多又好的货物，高兴地说：“过去我们都认为这样好的东西，我们国家不会制造，现在亲眼看到、买到了我们国家自己制造的又便宜又好的东西；从来没有见过的东西也见到啦，上海制造的缝衣机也买到啦。”
    在我所接触的青年当中，不管是傣族或者是哈尼族，都有一个共同愿望：他们要永远团结在祖国的大家庭里，把这个美丽富饶的地方建设起来，同其它兄弟民族一起，走向社会主义社会。
