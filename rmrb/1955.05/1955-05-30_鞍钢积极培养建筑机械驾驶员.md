　　Anshan Iron and Steel Actively Trains Construction Machinery Operators
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company’s mechanized construction scale will be very large this year. The number of various new-style heavy machinery will double compared to 1954. To solve the problem of insufficient technical strength, the company opened a mechanization school at the beginning of the year, organizing 498 young people to learn the skills of operating excavators, tractors, and other machinery. The instructors are all experienced veteran workers. For example, Liu Yanchun and Guan Huiren are among the first excavator operators to participate in the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, and they have already trained many apprentices in the past. After six or seven months of study, these four hundred-plus students will become construction machinery operators capable of independent operation. Recently, the company will also have the chief mechanical engineer preside over the rotational training of operators of nearly 20 types of light machinery at various construction sites, further improving their technical level.

　　鞍钢积极培养建筑机械驾驶员
    鞍山钢铁公司今年机械化施工规模很大，各式新式重型机械将比一九五四年增加一倍。为了解决技术力量不足的问题，该公司在年初就开办了一个机械化学校，组织四百九十八名青年学习操纵挖土机、拖拉机等技术。担任教员的都是操作经验丰富的老工人。如刘严春、关惠仁都是最先参加鞍钢建设的老挖土机手，过去已经带会不少徒弟。这四百多名学员经过六、七个月的学习以后，就将成为能够独立操作的建筑机械驾驶员。最近该公司还将由总机械师主持，轮流训练各工地近二十种轻型机械的操作工人，把他们的技术水平提高一步。
