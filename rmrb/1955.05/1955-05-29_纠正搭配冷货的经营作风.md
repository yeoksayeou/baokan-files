　　Correct the Business Practice of Bundling Slow-Moving Goods

　　To the Editor:

　　In order to solve the problem of unsalable raw tobacco in Hubei Province, the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Supply and Marketing Management Department sent people to the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Agricultural and Sideline Products Promotion and Management Office to purchase 10,000 dan of raw tobacco. The Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Management Office, knowing that the raw tobacco situation in Hubei Province was serious, stipulated that for every dan of raw tobacco sold, a pair of leather shoes must be bundled with it. However, the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Hubei Province already had a lot of leather shoes in stock. If another 10,000 pairs of leather shoes were added, it would inevitably lead to a backlog of funds. For this reason, the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative repeatedly requested that the leather shoes not be bundled or that as few as possible be bundled. However, the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative said: Raw tobacco is a hot-selling product, so it must be bundled with slow-selling goods. If your province is unwilling to bundle, we will not sell the raw tobacco... The Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative had no choice but to accept the requirements of the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative.

　　As far as I know, similar phenomena of bundling slow-moving goods with fast-moving goods are quite common in various places. There are state-owned specialized companies bundling slow-moving goods with cooperatives, there are brother cooperatives bundling slow-moving goods with each other, and there are higher-level supply and marketing cooperatives bundling slow-moving goods with lower-level supply and marketing cooperatives. As a result of such bundling, the retail units have no choice but to force bundling on the masses. This practice has already created a very bad impression among the masses. I believe that this business practice of bundling slow-moving goods must be corrected.

　  纠正搭配冷货的经营作风编辑同志：
    湖北省供销合作社供销经理部，为解决本省毛烟脱销，曾派人到四川省供销合作社农副产品推销经营处洽购毛烟一万担。四川省供销社经营处知道湖北省毛烟脱销情况严重，就规定出售毛烟一担，必须搭配皮鞋一双。但是湖北省基层供销社已经存了很多皮鞋，如果再增加这一万双皮鞋，势必造成资金积压。为此，湖北省供销合作社再三要求不要搭配或尽可能少搭配皮鞋。但是四川省供销合作社却说：毛烟是畅销货，一定要搭滞销货，你省不愿搭配，我们就不卖毛烟……。湖北省供销合作社迫不得已只好接受四川省供销合作社的要求。
    据我了解，类似这样的冷货热货互相搭配的现象，在各地是相当普遍的。有国营专业公司给合作社搭配冷货的，也有兄弟合作社之间搭配冷货的，还有上级供销社给下级供销社搭配冷货的。这样搭配的结果，最后零售单位也只得硬性给群众配搭。这种做法已在群众中造成了很不好的影响。我认为这种搭配冷货的经营作风必须纠正。
