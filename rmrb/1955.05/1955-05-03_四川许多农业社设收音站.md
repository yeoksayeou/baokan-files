　  Many Agricultural Cooperatives in Sichuan Establish Radio Stations
    Sichuan Province has currently established more than 290 agricultural production cooperative radio stations. The radios for these radio stations are completely provided free of charge by the Sichuan Provincial People's Broadcasting Station. Most of the radio stations are located in advanced mutual aid and cooperation areas such as Jiangjin, Suining, and Neijiang, and in Luzhou Prefecture, where the farming season starts earlier. The radio operators at each station have undergone specialized training. The radio stations have played a significant role in spring plowing production and other central rural work. After hearing on the radio that it was going to snow, the Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanbu County immediately made snow protection equipment for the cooperative's cattle, enabling the entire cooperative's cattle to safely weather the severe cold. After hearing the broadcast about preventing and controlling insect pests, the Sanshu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zizhong County organized its production teams to carry lanterns and torches to catch pests that same day. During rest periods, farmers often listen to excellent literary and artistic programs. Everyone says: "With a radio, we can listen to reports and operas every day!" (Wang Ru)

　  四川许多农业社设收音站
    四川省目前已建立了二百九十多个农业生产合作社收音站。这些收音站的收音机，完全是由四川省人民广播电台免费赠送的。收音站大部分布在江津、遂宁、内江等互助合作的先进地区和农事季节比较早的泸州专区。各站的收音员，都经过了专门的训练。收音站在春耕生产和其他农村中心工作中起了显著作用。南部县幸福农业生产合作社从收音机听到将要下雪的消息后，立即给社内的耕牛作防雪设备，使全社耕牛安全度过严寒。资中县三树农业生产合作社听了防治虫害的广播后，当天各生产队就打起灯笼、火把去捕捉害虫。休息时，农民们常收听优秀的文艺节目。大家说：“有了收音机，我们就可以天天听报告，听大戏！”（王茹）
