After reading the large amount of materials concerning the Hu Feng anti-Party clique published in the People's Daily on May 13th and 24th, Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary face has been fully exposed. From the materials, anyone can see that Hu Feng has consistently regarded progressive writers, both Party members and non-Party members, as his mortal enemies. He used all kinds of insulting language to wantonly slander these progressive writers. He directed members of his reactionary clique to use a so-called "whip of steel wire wrapped in rubber to beat prisoners" as a weapon to attack progressive writers, and even attempted to "annihilate" progressive writers "with the tactics of cluster hand grenades." Even more vicious was the fact that after the national liberation, he did not stop his criminal anti-Party and anti-people activities, but intensified them and became even more rampant. He directed members of his reactionary group to "use the tactics of Sun Wukong entering the belly," to infiltrate the Party, establish strongholds within the Party, open up positions, expand their power, and directed members of his reactionary group to gather intelligence, steal documents, and use the despicable tactics of "fighting and retreating, rolling and fighting" to preserve their strength, consolidate their positions, and encouraged them to "coexist and perish with the positions."

Such a thoroughly reactionary counter-revolutionary element is no different from Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents. In order to defend the cause of the revolution and purify the revolutionary literary ranks, I fully agree to expel Hu Feng from the Chinese Writers Association and remove him from all his posts, and I demand a thorough investigation of the anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary conspiracies of the members of the Hu Feng reactionary clique, and deal with them according to law.

    揭露和谴责胡风反革命集团的罪行
　　坚决反对胡风集团的罪行
　　翦伯赞
    看了五月十三日和二十四日的人民日报所发表的胡风反党集团的大批材料以后，胡风的反革命的面貌，已经十分昭著。从材料中，谁都可以看出胡风是一贯地把党和非党的进步作家当作他的死敌，他用尽一切带有侮辱性的言语肆意诋毁这些进步作家，他指挥他的反动小集团的分子用一种所谓“橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”作为武器去进攻进步作家，并且妄图“用集束手榴弹的战法”来集歼进步作家。更凶恶的是他在全国解放以后，还不停止他的反党反人民的罪恶活动，而且变本加厉，更加猖狂。他指挥他的反动集团的分子“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，打进党内，在党内建立据点，开辟阵地，扩大实力，而且指挥他的反动集团的分子探听情报，盗窃文件，用“且战且走，且打滚且作战”的下流战术来保存实力，巩固阵地，并鼓励他们“与阵地共存亡”。
    像这样反动透顶的反革命分子，和蒋匪的特务实在没有什么分别。为了保卫革命的事业，为了纯洁革命的文艺队伍，我完全赞成开除胡风的中国作家协会的会籍和撤销他所担任的一切职务，并要求彻底追查胡风反动集团的分子的反党反人民的反革命阴谋，依法予以处理。
