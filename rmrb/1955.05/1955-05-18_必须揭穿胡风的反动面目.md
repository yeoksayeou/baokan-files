　　It Is Imperative to Expose Hu Feng's Reactionary Features
　　Wang Kang
    I am a revolutionary soldier. After reading Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" and Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" published in the "People's Daily" on May 13th, I felt extreme anger. Hu Feng has always styled himself as a "follower" of the revolution for more than twenty years, seemingly presenting himself as a defender of realism in literary circles. But in reality, he is a complete hypocrite and careerist, a literary schemer who has long organized an anti-Party and anti-people clique, and has been frantically attacking the revolutionary literary cause led by the Party. After reading the materials provided by Shu Wu, it is even more clear that the Hu Feng anti-Party clique is a literary black gang with extreme political dangers.

    If one only reads Hu Feng's so-called "My Self-Criticism" without seeing the "bottom line" revealed by Shu Wu, naive people may once again be deceived by his tears. Phrases such as "bearing serious responsibility," feeling "the pain of indebtedness," "deeply feeling ashamed and pained," "feeling remorseful guilt," and "deeply feeling that I have let down the people, let down the Party and the cause of the class, and let down the great era," etc., seem truly full of tears and remorse.

    But as the "People's Daily" editor's note pointed out incisively, Hu Feng's words are merely his "strategy of shifting from offense to retreat (i.e., self-criticism)." They cannot deceive the eyes of the Party and the people after all. Our Party has rich political experience and will never be deceived by the smoke of Hu Feng's thrown "cluster grenades." Our Party knows how to fight.

    From the "materials" provided by Shu Wu, it can be seen that Hu Feng has always been the leader of a reactionary literary black gang, "living off others," constantly challenging, attacking, and impacting the Party, and adopting an extremely hostile, hateful, and resentful attitude towards progressive writers, both Party members and non-Party members.

    Hu Feng even dares to boast that he is "an organizer of literary work standing around the Party," and that "if it were not for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I personally would not have found a place to settle down in the past twenty years." What cunning words! He "stands around the Party," but when our Party was not yet a ruling party and was still engaged in arduous struggles against Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule on various fronts, he called our Party "official" and regarded Party member writers and non-Party progressive writers who attempted to criticize and educate him as thorns in his side, calling them "officials," "masters," "gentry," "judges," "imperial envoys," "philistines," "nobility," "maggots," "enemies," etc. He described their well-intentioned criticisms and admonitions as "rampant," "particularly vile" "resistance, counterattack," "crusade," "attack," "insult," etc. He "accumulated too much resentment" against them, he wanted to "meet the challenge," launch "charges," and he even directed his black gang members to "expend a little effort" to "shake" the revolutionary literary cause that our Party had painstakingly built since the "May Fourth" Movement! From the materials, it can be seen that he was very vigilant and very hypocritical towards all Party members and non-Party progressive writers who came into contact with him, "shaking hands and making merry with them while concealing contempt with a smile," but in his heart, he wanted to give them "a fatal blow." May I ask: can this be considered the attitude of a so-called "follower" of the revolution, a friend of the Communist Party who "stands around the Party" and stands with the Party? Is this merely the result of being "swollen by 'leftist' emotions" and "swollen by sectarian emotions"? He has always opposed the Party, but he insists on putting on a "friendly" posture. Hu Feng claims that he relies on the Party to "settle down," but in reality, he lives to attack the Party, curse the Party, slander the people, and suppress and exclude the new revolutionary forces. He lives by this kind of anti-Party and anti-people behavior. He superficially pretends to be a friend of the Party and the people, but in reality, he confesses that he has an irreconcilable feud with the Party and the people.

    Why did Hu Feng choose such a "thorny" path? The answer can be found in the many letters Hu Feng wrote to Shu Wu. This is what he himself realized: "The era is such an era, so we must consider our methods." The so-called "such an era" obviously refers to the era since Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was published in 1942, when the guiding ideology of the progressive literary movement in the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas was to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, when the Chinese people's masses were becoming increasingly revolutionary, and when the reactionary forces were increasingly collapsing. Hu Feng gnashed his teeth in hatred of the growing strength of the revolutionary forces, hated the strengthening and support of the Party's leadership of the literary movement, and "considered" that his "method" was not to attack the reactionary forces to seize leadership, but to attack the revolution, to seize leadership from the revolutionary forces, and after the victory of the revolution, to quickly implement his conspiracy to seize the fruits of the revolutionary victory for himself, and then transform literature and transform the world according to his bourgeois individualist careerist image. Given the general trend, he knew that it would not lead anywhere to openly take refuge in the increasingly declining Kuomintang, so he did not take that "road," and even when establishing offensive "strongholds" in reactionary newspapers and periodicals, he did not dare to use his real name; instead, he disguised himself from head to toe, performing the so-called "standing around the Party" and "following the revolution," in order to coat his black shop signboard with a protective color, so that his black shop goods could be sold under the banner of Marxism, and he also wanted to use this signboard to "win over people," "contact people," and expand his black gang forces. Once he gained power, naturally, he could tear up and abandon this deceptive signboard and openly start doing things. Isn't that so? Hu Feng has always styled himself as a Lu Xun worshiper, but behind people's backs, he actually said that Mr. Lu Xun's death anniversary was a "disaster" that was "extremely boring," and even simply cursed Lu Xun as a "dead man"! It is conceivable what a two-faced hypocrite Hu Feng is!

    Hu Feng repeatedly said that he had "not realized" and "not understood" the Party's ideological principles before, and that his anti-Party crimes were merely errors arising from "his petty-bourgeois standpoint" and were the result of "being divorced from leadership and not approaching leadership." This is another trick! From before liberation until more than five years after the nationwide liberation, the Party and the people's care, concern, education, and help for Hu Feng can be said to have been very generous and benevolent. As the "People's Daily" editor said, hundreds of thousands of Chinese petty-bourgeois intellectuals cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party and are willing to be led by the Party. Hu Feng and his clique, however, showed strong resistance and offense to the Party's leadership and education. Can this make people believe that Hu Feng and his clique only made mistakes due to their "petty-bourgeois standpoint"? Can this make people believe that Hu Feng and his clique still have any "revolutionary spirit" or share the same "fate with the people"? What "revolutionary humanism," what "democratic demands," etc., are all fake. After breaking through the magic mirror, Hu Feng is nothing more than an extremely arrogant reactionary element. For a long time, he has been acting pretentiously among young intellectuals, swindling and deceiving, spreading rumors, and doing everything possible. He is hostile to the Party and keeps the Party's education far away from him. He not only resists leadership and resists ideological remolding, but also wants to seize leadership and wants to "transform" the Party's literary policy and the entire literary cause led by the Party with his bourgeois reactionary ideological features. "Hu Feng's opinions on literary issues" are his most obvious anti-Party and anti-socialist construction program.

    Hu Feng is good at crying and weeping, good at expressing "sincerity," good at calling himself "excited," good at revealing his "mood," good at using the "bitter meat trick," good at pretending to be beaten, good at using the "returning carbine," and good at "fighting and retreating, rolling and fighting." Recognizing these deceptive strategies of his, one will not be deceived by his so-called "My Self-Criticism."

    Yes, our era is "such an era," an era that Hu Feng cannot transform. The revolutionary literary cause of the Chinese people is thriving under the correct leadership of the Party, the people's political consciousness is increasing day by day, and the vast majority of intellectuals from petty-bourgeois origins are willing to carry out ideological remolding, study Marxism-Leninism, and build our great socialist motherland together with the Party and the working people of the whole country. The "road" that Hu Feng used to take against the Party and the people is a dead end, and there is no other "road" to take. The only way out is what the "People's Daily" pointed out: "Tear off the mask, expose the truth, help the Party thoroughly understand the entire situation of Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique, and from then on be a real person..."

    Hu Feng and everyone in the Hu Feng anti-Party clique should honestly take Shu Wu as an example, surrender to the Party and the people, and hand over their guns!

　　必须揭穿胡风的反动面目
　　王康
    我是一个革命军人，我读了五月十三日“人民日报”登出的胡风的“我的自我批判”和舒芜提供的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”以后，感到极大的愤怒。胡风一向自命“追随”革命二十多年，在文艺界俨然以现实主义卫道者自居。可是实际上竟是一个彻头彻尾的伪君子、野心家，竟是一个长久以来组织反党反人民集团、向着党所领导的革命的文学事业疯狂进攻的文坛阴谋家。看了舒芜提供的材料以后，更使人觉得胡风反党集团是在政治上有极大危险性的文坛上的黑帮。
    如果仅仅读了胡风自己的所谓“我的自我批判”，而没有看到舒芜所揭露的“底”，天真的人们可能又要被他的眼泪所迷惑。什么负有“严重责任”啊，感到“负债的痛苦”啊，“深深地感到了惭愧和痛苦”啊，“感到了悔恨性的内疚”啊，“沉痛地感到辜负了人民，辜负了党和阶级事业，辜负了伟大的时代”啊，如此等等，似乎真是声泪俱下了。
    但正如“人民日报”按语一针见血地指出的，胡风的这些话不过是他“从进攻转变为退却（即检讨）的策略”。它们毕竟骗不过党和人民的眼睛。我们的党有丰富的政治经验，决不会被胡风投出的
  “集束手榴弹”的爆烟所迷惑，我们的党是懂得怎样战斗的。
    从舒芜提供的“材料”里可以看出，胡风历来就是一个“拿别人养活自己的”、长期向党挑战、进攻、冲击的反动的文坛黑帮的首领，长期以来，对党的和非党的进步作家采取极端敌对、仇视和痛恨的态度。
    胡风居然还要自诩为“站在党底周围的文学工作的组织者”，“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的”。这是多么狡猾的鬼话。他“站在党的周围”，但却在当我们的党还不是一个执政的党，还在各个战线上向蒋介石的反动统治进行艰苦斗争的时候，称我们的党是“官方”，把试图对他进行批评教育的党员作家和非党进步作家视若眼中之钉，称之为“官们”、
  “老爷们”、“豪绅们”、“法官”、“钦差”、“市侩”、“权贵”、“蛆虫”、“仇人”……把他们对他的善意批评和规劝说成是“猖獗”的、“特别恶劣”的“抵抗、反攻”、“讨伐”、“攻击”、
  “侮辱”，……他对他们“积了太多的愤恨”，他要“迎战”、打“冲锋”，他竟然指挥他的黑帮里的人要“化一点力气”来“动摇”我们党自“五·四”运动以来艰难缔造的革命文学事业！从材料里可以看出，他对凡是跟他接触的党员和非党进步作家都非常警惕，非常虚伪，“用微笑包着侮蔑和他们握手言欢”，而骨子里则是要给他们“一个致命的打击”。试问：这能够算是“站在党的周围”、和党站在一边的所谓“追随”革命的共产党的朋友的态度么？这难道仅仅是被“‘左’的情绪所膨胀”、
  “被宗派情绪所膨胀”的结果么？历来就是同党作对的，却偏要装出“友好”的姿态。胡风自称是靠着党才能“安身立命”的，实际上却是为了攻击党、咒骂党、对人民进行诬蔑、对革命的新生力量进行压制、排斥而活着的。他是靠这种反党反人民行为吃饭的。他表面上装扮成党和人民的朋友，实际上却自己招供与党和人民有不共戴天之仇。
    为什么胡风要选择这样一条“如履荆棘”的道路呢？这在胡风写给舒芜的许多信里可以找到答案。这就是他自己也认识到：“时代又是这样的时代，所以要考虑作法”。所谓“这样的时代”，显然是指自一九四二年毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以后，解放区的和蒋介石统治区的进步文学运动的主导思想是为工农兵服务的时代，是指中国人民大众日益革命化的时代，是指反动力量日趋崩溃的时代。胡风切齿痛恨革命力量的日趋壮大，痛恨党对文学运动的领导的加强和受到拥护，
  “考虑”到他的“作法”不是什么要进攻反动势力夺取领导权，而是要向革命进攻，向革命势力夺取领导权，在革命胜利之后，赶紧施展阴谋，想把革命胜利果实据为己有，然后按照他的资产阶级个人主义野心家的面貌来改造文学，改造世界。大势所趋，他自知明目张胆地投靠日趋没落的国民党是搞不出名堂来的，所以不走那条“路”，甚至在反动报刊上建立进攻“据点”时也不敢使用真名；而全身披挂地伪装起来，表演所谓“站在党的周围”“追随革命”，借以在他的黑店幌子上镀一层保护色，使他的黑店货色在马克思主义的招牌下得售，还要用这个招牌“争取人”，“联络人”，扩大他的黑帮势力。一旦得势了，自然连这块骗人的招牌也可以撕碎、抛弃，而公然地干起来。不是么？胡风一向自命为鲁迅崇拜者，但背着人，竟说鲁迅先生的逝世纪念会是“无聊之至”的“灾难”，竟干脆骂鲁迅为“死人”！可想而知，胡风是怎样一个两面派的伪君子！
    胡风口口声声说以前是“没有认识到”、“没有理解到”党的思想原则，他的反党罪行仅仅是从“自己的小资产阶级立场”而来的错误，是“脱离领导，不靠拢领导”的结果。这又是耍花枪！在解放以前一直到全国解放五年多，党和人民对胡风的照顾、关心、教育和帮助，可以说是十分优厚、仁至义尽的了。正如“人民日报”编者说的，中国的成千成万小资产阶级知识分子是和中国共产党合作、并愿意受党领导的。胡风及其小集团却对党的领导和教育表现了强烈的反抗和进攻。这能够叫人相信胡风他们仅仅是由于“小资产阶级立场”而犯错误吗？这能够叫人相信胡风他们还有什么“革命性”，还是同“人民共命运”的吗？什么“革命的人道主义”，什么“民主要求”等等，都是假的。拆穿了西洋镜，胡风无非是一个极端狂妄的反动分子。长期以来，他在青年知识分子中装腔作势，招摇撞骗，散布谣言，无所不为。他同党敌对，把党对他的教育拒之于千里之外。他岂止抗拒领导、抗拒思想改造而已，他还要夺取领导，还要以他的资产阶级反动的思想面貌来“改造”党的文艺政策和党所领导的整个文学事业。“胡风对文艺问题的意见”就是他的最明显不过的反党反社会主义建设的斗争纲领。
    胡风善于痛哭流涕，善于表示“真诚”，善于自称“激动”，善于揭露自己的“心情”，善于使苦肉计，善于装成挨打的样子，善于使用回马枪，善于“且战且走，且打滚且作战”。认识了他的这些欺骗人的策略，就不会被他的所谓“我的自我批判”所迷惑了。
    是的，我们的时代是“这样的时代”，是胡风所改造不了的时代，中国人民的革命文学事业在党的正确领导下日益欣欣向荣，人民的政治觉悟日益提高，广大的小资产阶级出身的知识分子都愿意进行思想改造，学习马克思列宁主义，跟随党和全国劳动人民一起建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国。胡风过去走的这条同党和人民作对的“路”是此路不通了，想走另外的“路”也无路可走了。唯一的出路就是“人民日报”指出的：“剥去假面，揭露真相，帮助党彻底弄清胡风及其反党集团的全部情况，从此做个真正的人……。”
    胡风以及胡风反党集团的每一个人，都应该老老实实，拿舒芜作榜样，向党和人民投降，缴枪！
