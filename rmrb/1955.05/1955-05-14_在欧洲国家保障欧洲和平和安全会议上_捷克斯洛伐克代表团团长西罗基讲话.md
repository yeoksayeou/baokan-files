Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 12th. According to a report by the Polish Press Agency: Siroky, the head of the delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, spoke on the 11th at the Conference of European Countries on Guaranteeing European Peace and Security.

Siroky said that the Czechoslovak delegation fully agrees with the detailed analysis made by the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Bulganin, on the international situation, and warmly welcomes the Soviet proposals on reducing armaments, banning atomic weapons, and eliminating the threat of new wars. These initiatives point out to all countries the way to achieve significant improvements in the overall international situation, to ease international tensions, and to solve particularly important issues concerning the interests of all countries in the world. The Czechoslovak government will fully support these peaceful efforts of the Soviet Union to make the Soviet proposals a reality.

Speaking about the Paris Agreements, Siroky said that with the revival of West German militarism and West Germany's participation in the Western aggressive bloc, a factor threatening peace, security, and national freedom has emerged in Europe. The United States is expanding its war bases in West German territory close to our borders. It has been intensifying the dispatch of saboteurs and spies across our borders. The American occupation authorities stationed in West Germany have increased their support for revanchist forces and fully support their provocative actions against our country. Many official representatives of the United States have fully accepted the Nazi war concept aimed at eliminating and re-enslaving our country. Our national and ethnic interests resolutely demand that peace-loving European countries form a new, united, and multilateral alliance. In addition, the defense work of our peace-loving European countries must be further consolidated and strengthened to meet the strategic, tactical, and technical requirements of modern warfare, so as to form a force sufficient to shatter all aggressive attempts by warmongers, if necessary.

Siroky said that the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance we are now discussing is fully in line with the interests and needs of the Czechoslovak people. Our treaty represents a new and closer union of peace-loving European countries. It is especially important that our efforts are supported by the great Asian power of the People's Republic of China, with its 600 million people, whose representative is participating in our conference as an observer. However, we are not forming a closed, isolated group that is hostile to the closed aggressive groups in the West. Our treaty is not only a solid foundation for the security of our countries and a common guarantee for our countries against aggression, it is not only the basis for our countries to cooperate with each other in peaceful construction and in the struggle for peace, but it is also a solid and reliable guarantee for our efforts to defend the peace and security of all European countries, to resolve various disputes through consultation, and to achieve the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, universal disarmament, and the realization of peaceful and friendly relations between countries.

Siroky emphasized that we have always opposed, and will continue to oppose, the division of Europe into hostile blocs. We still firmly believe that the only correct and acceptable path to be adopted by all European countries is the path of collective security. Our treaty welcomes the participation of all countries that are willing to work with us to ensure peace and the security of all countries. This treaty is fully in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.

Siroky concluded by saying that the Czechoslovak people are contributing all their strength to peace and creative work. For the sake of friendship and cooperation, we extend a hand of friendship to all countries, all nations, and all sincere people. However, we will never relax our vigilance in the face of the plans of the Western aggressive forces. If the aggressive forces go mad and launch a war of aggression against us, then our people, together with their allies, will do everything in their power to completely destroy the aggressors. The Czechoslovak government, on behalf of the entire Czechoslovak people, declares that it fully supports the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between the eight countries, that it will accept all the principles of the treaty and the obligations of the treaty, and that it will always faithfully abide by this treaty.

　　在欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议上
　　捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长西罗基讲话
    新华社华沙十二日　电据波兰通讯社报道：捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表团团长西罗基，十一日在欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议上讲了话。
    西罗基说，捷克斯洛伐克代表团完全同意苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁对国际局势所作的详细分析，并热烈欢迎苏联所提出的关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁的建议。这些倡议向所有国家指出了使整个国际局势获得显著改进、使国际紧张局势得以缓和、使有关世界上所有国家的利益的特别重要问题得以解决的道路。捷克斯洛伐克政府将以全力来支持苏联的这些和平努力，使苏联的建议得以实现。
    西罗基在谈到巴黎协定时说，在复活西德军国主义和西德参加西方侵略集团的同时，一个威胁和平、安全和国家自由的因素在欧洲产生了。美国正在靠近我们国境的西德领土上扩大它的战争基地。它一直在加紧派遣破坏分子、间谍越过我国边境。驻西德的美国占领当局增加了对复仇主义势力的支援，而且充分支持他们对我国的挑衅行动。美国的许多官方代表完全接受了纳粹的目的在于消灭并且再度使我国戴上枷锁的战争观念。我们的国家和民族利益断然要求爱好和平的欧洲国家组成一个新的、统一的、多边的联盟。此外，我们爱好和平的欧洲国家的防御工作还必须更进一步地巩固和加强，以满足现代化战争的战略、战术和技术的要求，以形成一支足能粉碎，如果必要的话，战争贩子的一切侵略尝试的力量。
    西罗基说，我们现在正在讨论的友好、合作和互助条约，是完全符合于捷克斯洛伐克人民的利益和需要的。我们的条约表现了欧洲爱好和平的国家的一种新的、更密切的联合。尤其重要的是，我们的努力得到拥有六亿人民的亚洲大国——中华人民共和国的支持，中华人民共和国的代表正以观察员身份参加我们的会议。但是，我们并不是组成一个关门的、孤立的、和西方的关门的侵略集团敌对的集团。我们的条约不仅是我们这些国家的安全的巩固基础和我们这些国家抵抗侵略的共同保障，它不仅是我们这些国家在进行和平建设和争取和平的斗争中相互合作的基础，它还是我们为保卫所有欧洲国家的和平和安全、用协商办法解决各种争执问题以及实现禁止大规模毁灭性武器、普遍裁减军备和实现各国间的和平和友好关系所作的努力的巩固的、可靠的保障。
    西罗基强调说，我们过去一直反对，而且将继续反对欧洲分裂成敌对集团。我们仍然坚决相信所有欧洲国家应采用的唯一的正确的和可以接受的道路是集体安全的道路。我们的条约是欢迎一切愿意同我们一道来努力保证和平和各国安全的国家参加的。这个条约是完全符合联合国宪章的目的和原则的。
    西罗基最后说，捷克斯洛伐克人民把他们的全部力量贡献给和平和创造性的工作。为了友好和合作，我们向所有国家、所有民族、所有有诚意的人民伸出友谊之手。然而，在西方侵略势力的计划面前，我们一刻也不会放松我们的警惕。如果侵略势力发了疯，要向我们发动侵略战争，那么，我们的人民将同他们的盟友一起尽他们的所有的力量来彻底摧毁侵略者。捷克斯洛伐克政府代表捷克斯洛伐克全体人民宣布：它完全支持八国之间的友好、合作和互助条约，它将接受条约的全部原则和条约的义务，并且将永远忠实地遵守这个条约。
