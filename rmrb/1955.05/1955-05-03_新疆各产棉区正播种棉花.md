Cotton Planting Underway in Various Cotton-Producing Areas of Xinjiang

　　Cotton-producing areas in Xinjiang are busily planting cotton. Areas such as Turpan, Korla, Aksu, and Hotan have warm climates suitable for cotton cultivation. Uyghur and other ethnic farmers utilize groundwater or snowmelt from the Tianshan Mountains to irrigate their cotton fields, resulting in high cotton yields. Now, south of the Tianshan Mountains, spring is in full bloom, and cotton farmers of all ethnic groups in Turpan County, led by the county's seventeen agricultural production cooperatives, are comprehensively engaged in cotton planting. The Turpan Cotton Plantation, affiliated with the Production and Construction Corps in the Hami Reclamation Area, is planting long-staple cotton. During the planting period, Soviet cotton experts Titov, Khevilya, and others traveled from Urumqi to the plantation to provide guidance. The Soviet experts suggested planting a row of sorghum alongside the cotton to prevent wind and sand damage. The cotton fields opened up by the Production and Construction Corps in the Manas River Reclamation Area north of the Tianshan Mountains have also begun planting. (Our correspondent in Urumqi)

　  新疆各产棉区正播种棉花
    新疆产棉地区正紧张地播种棉花。吐鲁番、库尔勒、阿克苏、和阗等地气候温暖，适于种棉，维吾尔等族农民利用地下水或天山的雪水灌溉棉田，棉花产量很高。现在天山以南春暖花开，吐鲁番县各族棉农在全县十七个农业生产合作社带动下，全面展开了棉花播种。哈密垦区部队所属吐鲁番植棉场，正播种长绒棉。播种期间，苏联植棉专家提托夫、赫维利亚等由乌鲁木齐赶到该场进行指导。苏联专家建议在播种棉花的同时播种一行高粱，以防风沙侵害。天山以北玛纳斯河垦区部队开辟的棉田，也开始了播种。（本报驻乌鲁木齐记者）
