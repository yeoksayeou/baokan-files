　　Strive for Further Prosperity and Improvement of Chinese Art
    The Second National Art Exhibition currently being held in Beijing comprehensively demonstrates the creative achievements of artists across the country since the founding of our nation. From the nearly one thousand works of more than six hundred artists, it can be seen that the vast majority of artists are working diligently and making rapid progress; the ranks of art workers are expanding, many artists who had ceased creative activities for many years have taken up their brushes again, and many talented young artists have emerged. Under the guidance of the literary and artistic policy of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers," artists are using their creative practice to inspire the people's noble enthusiasm for building and defending the motherland.
    This exhibition demonstrates that the subjects of Chinese artists' creations are broad and rich. The tremendous changes in all aspects of our country in the process of revolutionary war and economic construction are reflected in a number of realistic and moving ways. When you see the various corners of the great motherland, the faces of various figures among the great people, the diverse scenes of their lives and labor, and the diverse expressions of their inner selves at the exhibition, you cannot help but feel joy in your heart. Many scenes and titles are not only absent from the history of Chinese art, but also unnoticed and unseen by many viewers before. The tendency of formulaic and conceptual art creation has been largely corrected. The ideological and artistic level of the artists has been significantly improved, which is basically the result of their hard work in observing the lives of the masses and engaging in sketching activities.
    The works exhibited at the exhibition are also rich and colorful in terms of form and style. Not only have more popular New Year pictures, comic strips, and cartoons been greatly developed and improved, but also oil paintings, sculptures, woodcuts, ink paintings, watercolors, book illustrations, etc., have been greatly enlivened due to social needs and promotion. It is particularly worth noting that the creation of traditional ink paintings in Chinese painting art, based on the principle of "weeding through the old to bring forth the new," has begun to face reality, use modern sketching methods, engage in the depiction of new characters and new things, and has produced many vivid and novel works. The application of this realistic creative method has greatly changed the long-standing practice of imitation and antiquarianism in the Chinese painting circle. Under the premise of realism, artists in all fields are trying to create new forms and styles, which is more significant in woodcuts. New Year pictures have broken through the limitations of the past, not only with a wider range of themes, but also with more diverse painting methods. In various types of works, inaccurate and unreasonable shapes have been greatly reduced, which is a necessary condition for Chinese art to continue to advance along the path of realism.
    The tendency of flourishing art creation reflects the Chinese people's thirst for cultural life. The liberated people demand aesthetic experiences everywhere in their daily lives. In recent years, art publishing, art crafts, and art education have all developed, and the number of art exhibitions has gradually increased (in 1954, more than ninety exhibitions and observation meetings were held in provinces and cities across the country), which has strengthened the connection between art and the masses. This has played a great role in stimulating the creative enthusiasm of artists, improving the artistic skills of artists, and cultivating the aesthetic taste of the people. However, it should be said that the work that has been done is still very little, and still far behind the needs of the masses. While affirming the achievements in art creation, it should also be pointed out that there are still many obstacles on the road of advancement for artists.
    In order to emphasize the brightness and happiness in people's lives, many artists have obviously simplified and beautified life, making life too much like a naive carnival on holidays, while the spirit of the people's resolute struggle and overcoming difficulties in the process of striving for a better life is rarely powerfully expressed. More artists often focus on pursuing the external truth when depicting characters, but do not pay attention to the profound and powerful expression of the characters' mental state; some works even falsely exaggerate the characters' postures and actions, thinking that this is the expression of character and the beauty of modeling. There are also many works that, because they do not pay attention to the use of concentrated and generalized expression techniques, and do not completely select and refine the characters and things on the screen strictly according to the requirements of the work's theme, result in complicated content, extravagant forms, and insufficient prominence of important plots and main characters on the screen. These shortcomings show that artists do not have a deep enough understanding of life, are not good at capturing the most intense and moving elements in life, and expressing them with the most vivid and moving images.
    Artists still need to continue to delve into the depths of life and the depths of beauty, strive to be familiar with people's lives and inner selves, strive to improve their ability to create images and manipulate the techniques of modeling, composition, and coloring, in order to produce beautiful works that are worthy of our era and can shock people's souls. Artists, like other "engineers of the human soul" in the field of literature and art, need to strengthen their Marxist-Leninist cultivation, because Marxism-Leninism is the basic weapon for people to understand life and criticize life, it can help artists develop a revolutionary enthusiasm for life, strengthen their ability to understand and criticize life, and thus make their art creation reach the realm of socialist realism.
    The efforts of Chinese artists, as demonstrated by the Second National Art Exhibition, make us believe that artists will certainly be able to realize our wishes. China's people's art is still in its youth, but its future is unlimited.

### 争取我国美术的进一步繁荣和提高

　　争取我国美术的进一步繁荣和提高
    正在北京举行的第二届全国美术展览会，集中地表现了我国建国以来全国美术家们的创作成绩。从六百多个作者的近一千件作品中可以看出：绝大多数美术家的工作是努力的，进步是很快的；美术工作队伍是扩大了，不少停止创作活动多年的美术家动起了画笔，并且涌现了许多有才能的青年美术家。美术家们在“为工农兵服务”的文艺方针指导下，正在以自己的创作实践，鼓舞着人民建设祖国和保卫祖国的高尚热情。
    这个展览会表现出我国美术家创作的题材是广阔和丰富的。我国在革命战争和经济建设的过程中各个方面的巨大变化都有一些真实动人的反映。当你从展览会上看到伟大祖国的各个角落，看到伟大人民中间的各种人物的面貌，看到他们的生活和劳动的多种场景，以及他们的内心的多种表现的时候，你不能不感到内心的喜悦。很多画面和画题不但是我国的美术历史上所没有的，也是许多观众以前所没有注意过和没有看见过的。美术创作中的公式化、概念化的倾向在很大的程度上被纠正了。美术家们的思想艺术水平有了显著的提高，这基本上是他们辛勤地观察群众生活和从事写生活动的结果。
    在展览会上展出的作品在形式和风格方面也是丰富多彩的。不但比较通俗的年画、连环画和漫画有了很大的发展和提高，而且油画、雕塑、木刻、彩墨画、水彩画、书籍插图等，也由于社会的需要和提倡而大大活跃起来了。特别值得注意的是我国绘画艺术中传统的彩墨画创作根据“推陈出新”的原则，开始面向现实，运用现代的写生方法，从事新人物和新事物的描写，并且产生了不少形象生动、风格新颕的作品。这种现实主义创作方法的运用，大大改变了国画界长期以临摹仿古为正道的风气。在现实主义的前提下，各方面的美术家们都在尝试着创造新的形式和风格，这在木刻方面更为显著。年画打破了过去的限制，不但题材更加广泛，画法也更加多样了。在各类作品中，造型上不准确和不合理的情形都已经大大减少，而这正是我国美术沿着现实主义道路继续前进的必要条件。
    美术创作的趋向繁荣反映了我国广大人民对于文化生活的如饥似渴的爱慕。解放了的人民在日常生活中到处要求美的感受。近几年来，美术出版事业、美术工艺事业和美术教育事业都有了发展，美术展览会的举行也逐渐增多（一九五四年全国各省市举行了展览会和观摩会九十多次），使美术同群众的联系加强了。这在激发美术家的创作热情，提高美术家的艺术技巧，培养人民群众的审美趣味方面，都起了很大的推动作用。但是应当说，已经做的工作还是很少的，还落在群众需要后面很远。在肯定美术创作上的成就的同时，还应当指出：在美术家的前进的道路上，依然存在着许多障碍。
    不少的美术家为了强调人民生活中的光明和快乐，显然把生活简单地美化了，使生活过多地成为节日的天真的狂欢，而对于人民在争取美好生活过程中坚决斗争和克服困难的精神，却很少加以有力的表现。更多的美术家在描写人物时常常热心于追求外表的真实，而不重视人物精神状态的深刻有力的表现；有的作品甚至虚假地夸张人物的姿态和动作，以为这就是性格的表现和美的造型。也有不少作品，因为没有注意运用集中和概括的表现手法，没有完全根据作品主题的要求对画面上的人物和事物加以严格的取舍和提炼，以致内容烦琐，形式铺张，重要情节和主要人物在画面上不够突出。这些缺点说明美术家们认识生活还不够深刻，还不善于捕捉生活中最强烈动人的要素，并且用最鲜明动人的形象表现出来。
    美术家们还需要继续深入生活的堂奥和美的堂奥，力求熟悉人的生活和内心，力求提高自己创造形象的能力和操纵造型、构图、着色的技巧，以求产生无愧于我们时代的、足以震撼人的灵魂的优美作品。美术家们同文学艺术领域的其他“人类灵魂的工程师”们一样，需要加强自己的马克思列宁主义的修养，因为马克思列宁主义是人们认识生活和批判生活的基本武器，它能帮助美术家对生活发生革命的热情，加强对生活理解和批判的能力，因而使他们的美术创作达到社会主义现实主义的境地。
    由第二届全国美术展览会所表现出来的我国美术家的努力，使我们相信美术家们一定能够实现我们的愿望。我国的人民美术事业还在它的青年时期，但是它的前途是无限的。
