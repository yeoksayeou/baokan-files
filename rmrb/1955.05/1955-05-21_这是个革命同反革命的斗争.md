　　This is a Struggle Between Revolution and Counter-Revolution
　　Zhang Tianyi
    After reading Shu Wu's "Some Materials Concerning the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique," I was extremely angry and also very surprised. We did not anticipate that the Hu Feng group would be such a group! Our political vigilance towards these people was indeed insufficient.
    Some of our comrades and friends—all those who knew Hu Feng or had dealt with him—thought they knew something about Hu Feng as a person. When we talked about the Hu Feng issue, we believed that if we only criticized Hu Feng's "thought" and "theory" without exposing Hu Feng's extreme selfishness, hypocrisy, and treachery, without exposing his extreme individualism, we could not truly make the masses recognize Hu Feng and his group. Hu Feng's "theory" was merely a trick to deceive people, which even he himself did not believe. Did Hu Feng really think his stuff was Marxism? -- That would be underestimating him too much. It would be best to outline the face of this kind of individualistic careerist. This is also a typical case.
    But now, we realize that we did not know him well enough in the past and did not understand the true face of him and his group. We had doubts before. Especially when the Hu Feng group became more and more rampant, we couldn't help but suspect that this group was being used by counter-revolutionaries. However, we had always regarded Hu Feng as a friend, wanting to save him, persuade him, offer him suggestions, and criticize him. We had always regarded the Hu Feng issue as a problem within the united front. And we were even afraid of criticizing him unfairly or incompletely, always saying: no matter how Hu Feng formed cliques, how he pretended to be a Marxist to deceive young people, how he always attacked us with sarcasm and resentment, hated all progressive writers inside and outside the Party, but did not hate the Kuomintang reactionaries, Hu Feng still had some merits in the revolutionary literary movement, and so on.
    We were completely deceived by him! Now we are beginning to understand the nature of the Hu Feng group. It is definitely not as simple as we had imagined, just a gang of individualistic careerist rogues, just trying to establish a "literary" foothold as bullies. The problem is much more serious than that. This is clearly a well-organized group with its strategies and tactics, its action program, that is, its conspiracy plan, a stubborn anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary group that "cannot be compromised"—anyone with a little political struggle experience can see this at a glance.
    The problem of Hu Feng and his group is definitely not just a matter of thought, nor is it just a matter of the literary and art circles. This is a serious struggle—a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. It is the responsibility of every person who supports the revolution to pay attention to, expose, and eliminate hidden counter-revolutionary elements. We literary and art workers cannot stand outside this struggle.
    Moreover, we literary and art workers should seriously think about this incident. This is a great and painful lesson for us.
    The political atmosphere in our literary and art circles should be strengthened, and liberalism cannot be allowed anymore: otherwise, hidden counter-revolutionary elements will still find loopholes to exploit. We must unite, but it must be a unity with criticism: otherwise, hidden counter-revolutionary elements will still find loopholes to exploit. We cannot leave the Party spirit principle or be separated from the masses for a moment: otherwise, hidden counter-revolutionary elements will still find loopholes to exploit.
    We should remember this lesson. We must temper and improve ourselves in the struggle against Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary hidden elements.

　　这是个革命同反革命的斗争
　　张天翼
    看了舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”，气得不行，而且又很吃一惊。我们没有估计到胡风集团是这样一个集团！对这帮人，我们的政治警觉的确太不够了。
    我们的一些同志和朋友——凡是认得胡风的，或是曾和胡风打过交道的，都以为自己总多多少少知道了一些胡风之为人。我们谈起胡风问题时，认为我们如果光只批判胡风的那套“思想”“理论”，而不揭露胡风的极端自私、虚伪、阴险，不揭露他的极端个人主义，那还不能使群众真正认识胡风及其集团。胡风的那套“理论”只不过是他骗骗人的把戏，连他自己也不相信的。难道胡风真的会以为他那套东西就是马克思主义么？——那太把他看扁了。最好把他这号个人主义野心家的脸嘴勾勒一下。这也是个典型。
    可是现在，我们才发现我们过去对他认识得太不够了，并没有弄清他和他集团的真面目。我们也曾怀疑过。尤其在胡风集团愈来愈张牙舞爪的时候，我们更不得不怀疑：这个集团是为反革命分子所利用的。然而我们还一直把胡风当做友人，想挽救他，劝他，向他提意见，批评他。我们一直还把胡风问题当做统一战线内部的问题。而且还生怕批评得不公平不全面，总要说：不论胡风如何结帮口，如何伪装马克思主义者来欺骗青年，如何一向总是冷嘲热骂地攻击我们，仇视一切的党和党外的进步作家，而不仇视国民党反动派，可是胡风对革命文艺运动总还是有些功绩的，云云。
    我们完全是受了他的骗！现在才开始明白了胡风集团的性质。这决不像我们所曾设想的那么简单，只是个人主义野心家的流氓帮口，只是在“文坛”上打码头当恶霸而已。问题比这要严重得多。这明明是一个有组织，有它的战略和策略，有它的行动纲领，也就是有它阴谋计划的，是“妥协不来”的顽强的反党反人民反革命的集团，——这，只要有一点点政治斗争经验的人就一望而知的。
    胡风及其集团的问题决不只是什么思想问题，也不只是文艺界的问题。这是个严重的斗争——革命和反革命的斗争。注意、揭露、清除反革命暗藏分子，是每个拥护革命的人的责任。我们文艺工作者更不能站在这个斗争以外。
    而且我们文艺工作者正应当把这次事件好好想一想。这对我们是一个极大的也是痛心的教训。
    我们文艺界政治空气应该加强，不能再容许自由主义了：否则，反革命暗藏分子是还会钻空子的。我们要团结，可是是有批评的团结：否则，反革命暗藏分子是还会钻空子的。我们一时一刻也不能离开党性原则，不能脱离群众：否则，反革命暗藏分子是还会钻空子的。
    我们正该记取这个教训。我们要在对胡风反革命暗藏分子的斗争中锻炼自己，提高自己。
