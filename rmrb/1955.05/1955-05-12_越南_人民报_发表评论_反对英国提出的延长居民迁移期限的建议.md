The Vietnamese "People's Daily" Publishes Commentary
Opposing British Proposal to Extend Resident Migration Deadline

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an article on the 10th entitled "Requesting an Extension of the Migration Deadline is an Unreasonable Act Violating the Geneva Accords."

The article said that according to foreign news agencies, Britain recently suggested extending the deadline for free choice of residence in Vietnam, as stipulated by the Geneva Accords, which is due to expire on May 18th this year. Britain's suggestion is not accidental. For a long time, American imperialism, the French colonialists who oppose the Geneva Accords, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have expressed this view.

The article said that the mastermind behind this matter is American imperialism. Requesting an extension of the deadline for free choice of residence is a violation of the Geneva Accords. The aim of the United States is to first undermine one clause of the agreement, and then further undermine the most important clause of the agreement, namely, to achieve the reunification of Vietnam through free general elections in July 1956.

The article pointed out that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people have always strictly and thoroughly implemented the various provisions of the Geneva Accords. The news that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is obstructing the free movement and free choice of residence of the people is not in accordance with the facts.

The article said that Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong announced at the Asian-African Conference that extending the migration deadline was unnecessary. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam proactively proposed to the South Vietnamese authorities on February 4th this year to restore normal relations between the North and South in order to allow people to move freely for livelihood, business, and mutual visits.

The article concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people resolutely oppose Britain's unreasonable proposal to extend the migration deadline.

### 越南“人民报”发表评论　反对英国提出的延长居民迁移期限的建议

　　越南“人民报”发表评论
　　反对英国提出的延长居民迁移期限的建议
    据新华社讯　越南“人民报”十日发表了一篇题为“要求延长迁移期限是违反日内瓦协定的无理行为”的文章。
    文章说，据外国通讯社报道，英国最近建议延长日内瓦协定所规定的到今年五月十八日截止的、在越南自由选择居住地方的期限。英国的建议并不是偶然的。很久以来，美帝国主义、反对日内瓦协定的法国殖民派和吴庭艳集团就曾表示过这种意见。
    文章说，这件事情的主谋者是美帝国主义。要求延长自由选择居住地方的期限，是违反日内瓦协定的。美国的目的是企图先破坏协定的一个条款，然后再进一步破坏协定的最重要条款，即在一九五六年七月以自由普选来实现越南的统一。
    文章指出，越南民主共和国政府和越南人民一向严格地、彻底地执行日内瓦协定的各项条款。那些说越南民主共和国政府阻挠人民自由往来和自由选择居住地方的消息都是不符合实际的。
    文章说，范文同副总理在亚非会议上宣布过，延长迁移期限是不必要的。越南民主共和国政府在今年二月四日曾主动地向南越当局提出恢复南北正常关系，以便使人民自由往来谋生经商和互相访问。
    文章最后说，越南人民坚决反对英国的延长迁移期限的无理建议。
