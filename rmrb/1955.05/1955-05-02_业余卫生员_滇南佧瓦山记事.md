　　Amateur Health Worker
　　——Notes from the Kawa Mountains of Southern Yunnan
　　Peng Jingfeng
    The day I arrived at Dalisuo Village was a rare sunny day in the long rainy season of the Kawa Mountains in southern Yunnan. In the work team's room, a small table made of bamboo was covered with small medicine bottles, ointments, and simple medical equipment, like the home of an ordinary company medic. The equipment wasn't extensive, but it was neatly arranged. In these Kawa Mountains, where medical personnel were still scarce, I was excited to find that this work team had a health worker. I couldn't help but say, "Your team is great! You even have a health worker."
    "Our health worker here is an amateur health worker, Zhang Gaolong from our team does it on the side," a member of the work team replied.
    Although the name Zhang Gaolong was unfamiliar to me, he was well-known in the dozen or so Kawa and Lahu villages nearby. Everyone knew that there was a Zhang Gaolong in the work team who could explain Chairman Mao's principles to them, help them with their affairs, and also treat their illnesses.
    During the days I stayed in Dalisuo Village, I saw many Kawa and Lahu people coming to Zhang Gaolong every day to ask him to treat their illnesses. Whether it was day, dusk, or late at night, as long as Zhang Gaolong was home, he would "always be responsive" to those who came seeking medical help. Once, a Lahu child from a distant village carried a bag of yellow fruit to see him. When he saw that Zhang Gaolong wasn't home, he sat silently outside the door waiting. As soon as Zhang Gaolong returned, the child cheered and ran up to him, talking to Zhang Gaolong in Lahu, and Zhang Gaolong answered in his not-so-fluent Lahu. Suddenly, I saw the child hand over the bag of yellow fruit, which Zhang Gaolong pushed back with a flushed face. It turned out that this child had been ill, and Zhang Gaolong had cured him, so he brought the yellow fruit to give to Zhang Gaolong to eat.
    Once, the leader of the work team, Director Zhang, had to go to Nanyu Village for work, and I went with him. Nanyu Village was on the mountain opposite Dalisuo Village, but it was a forty or fifty li walk, going down from the mountain peak with biting cold winds to the Nanxiang River valley where people still sweated with bare torsos, and then across a rattan suspension bridge hanging in mid-air.
    We arrived at noon. The Lahu people in the village were still in the fields and hadn't returned. Only some children, accompanied by the barking of dogs, rushed out of the bamboo buildings, running and shouting, "Uncle Liberation Army is here, Uncle Liberation Army is here."
    A beautiful Lahu woman carrying a bundle of firewood came to greet us. The director told me that this woman was Nala, the daughter of the Nanyu Village headman, Zhai Yi. She had once been very ill, and Zhang Gaolong had cured her as well.
    That was in August of 1954, during the rainy season, with strong winds and heavy rain all day long, and hardly a sunny day for ten consecutive days. At that time, Nala fell ill with gastrointestinal malaria. She had stomach pains and a fever all over her body at night. Her illness was severe and came on suddenly. The ancestral method of killing chickens to sacrifice to ghosts did nothing to alleviate the illness. The elderly mother and strong husband remembered Chairman Mao and the Liberation Army work team stationed in Dalisuo Village, and remembered that there was a Zhang Gaolong there. Perhaps he would have a solution! So they sent someone out that night, braving the heavy rain, to cross the turbulent Nanxiang River and rush to the work team to request Zhang Gaolong to come and treat her.
    In the People's Army, no one would refuse in such a situation just because it was raining and late at night. Zhang Gaolong set off with some medicine and another comrade.
    The thirty-plus li from Dalisuo Village to the Nanxiang River was all steep, slippery downhill road, and it was a dark, rainy night where you couldn't see your fingers. They weren't walking, but almost rolling down, stumbling every three steps and slipping every five, their bodies covered in mud and rainwater, their mouths and noses filled with muddy water. Just as they were about to reach Nanyu Village, Zhang Gaolong slipped and fell more than two zhang away. When he struggled to get up, his right foot was injured, and the pain made it impossible for him to stand. But he still had to go forward! The critically ill patient was waiting for him to treat her! A strong sense of responsibility urged him on. He gritted his teeth and, with the help of that comrade, hobbled forward one step at a time. By the time he reached Nanyu Village, his right foot was so swollen that he couldn't wear his shoes. But he endured his own pain and immediately treated the patient. Now, this woman has recovered her health.
    I felt a little strange. Zhang Gaolong understood medical care, and at a time when medical personnel were scarce in the border areas, he should have been assigned as a health worker. Why was he transferred to this work team? Zhang Gaolong later told me about this issue. He joined the local Yunnan guerrilla forces in 1949, when he was only fifteen years old and not even as tall as a rifle. Initially, he was a messenger. After the guerrilla forces merged with the regular army, he was transferred to a medical training team to study for six months, and after graduating, he served as a medic in a certain regiment's medical team for more than a year.
    At that time, young Zhang Gaolong thought: there's nothing better than being a soldier in a combat squad, so he requested a change of work several times. During the troop reorganization in the spring of 1952, his request was approved by the higher-ups, and he was transferred to be a soldier. He achieved his goal and was very happy. For several years, he followed the troops in battles along the Lancang River, showing courage and resourcefulness in every battle. In May 1953, he was honorably admitted into the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.
    In the autumn of 1953, due to the needs of ethnic work in the Kawa Mountains, a group of comrades was to be transferred from the army to strengthen the existing work teams. Zhang Gaolong was also transferred.
    After arriving at the work team, he worked in the Kawa and Lahu villages all day long, which made him understand more deeply than before the painful lives of the Kawa Mountain people who had long been under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. He saw that the people in this area, unable to overcome diseases, would kill pigs, cows, and chickens to sacrifice to ghosts when they got sick. One patient even killed all the livestock used for production and sold their last pot to buy chickens for sacrifices, but the illness still didn't get better. Medical personnel in the Kawa Mountains were still very few, and could only focus on working in a few major tribes, and couldn't temporarily come to these remote corners. Zhang Gaolong thought: Perhaps his shallow medical knowledge could be of some use for the time being.
    With the approval of higher authorities, he began his amateur health worker work in July 1954. His medical knowledge was limited, so he looked up reference books for things he didn't understand. When he encountered more difficult problems, he ran to the nearby company to consult the health instructor there, or returned to the brigade headquarters to ask the comrades in the medical team for help. His love for the people allowed him to overcome many difficulties.
    The Kawa Mountains are full of large mountains, but there is a rare, flat dam near the Nanxiang River. It's not known how many years ago it was, but the Dai people had cultivated paddy fields here. Due to the hot and humid climate in the valley, malaria spread particularly easily, and most of the people who planted paddy fields died of illness. The remaining Dai people didn't dare to live there anymore and moved elsewhere. For a long time, the story became more and more terrifying, and the people in this area all said that there were ghosts there, that the fields couldn't be cultivated, and that people would die if they went there. After liberation, the Lahu people in Fulao Village also wanted to cultivate that paddy field and develop production. But they still suspected that there were ghosts on the dam.
    Based on the various concerns of the people in Fulao Village, the work team repeatedly explained things, and also lent them grain seeds and farming tools, and gave them medicine as gifts. The people of Fulao Village were finally able to feel at ease and go down to reclaim the land. People living on the mountain found it difficult to get used to the climate for a while. In the first few days, many people fell ill. Hidden bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors: "The ghosts are back, hurry back to the mountain!" The rumors confused the Lahu people who still believed in ghosts and spirits, and many people wavered, preparing to return to the mountains. At this time, the work team sent Zhang Gaolong in time. After examination, the patients were almost all suffering from malaria. He stayed in the village and gave quinine to the Lahu people, and gave injections to those who were seriously ill. After this, the comrades from the Ximeng medical team also came here to treat the patients many times. The sick people gradually recovered, and the Lahu people then believed that it was not ghosts, but malaria. Afterwards, they got used to the climate here, and their enthusiasm for reclaiming wasteland grew even stronger. Last autumn, there was truly a scene of abundant harvest, and the golden rice grew taller than people. The Lahu people of Fulao Village were just clapping their hands, saying: "This is the kindness of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Liberation Army comrades! Without them, we wouldn't have been able to cultivate this paddy field!" At harvest time, dozens of households in the entire village each took out a portion of the new rice, had people carry it, ran more than thirty li up the mountain road, and delivered it to Dalisuo Village, insisting that the comrades of the work team also taste the new rice.
    In this way, from July to the end of October 1954, Zhang Gaolong treated a total of more than 1,790 people, not including surgical treatments. I thought: If it weren't for this amateur health worker Zhang Gaolong, how many simple Lahu and Kawa people would have been taken away by death!
    On the day I left, Zhang Gaolong was carrying his medicine bag and running back and forth between the villages. His task from the higher authorities was to vaccinate the 20,000 Kawa and Lahu people in that area with cowpox. He also excitedly told me: The higher authorities have decided that a medical team will be set up here in a few months, and at that time, the health of the people in this area will be even more guaranteed.

　　业余卫生员
　　——滇南佧瓦山记事
　　彭荆风
    我到大力索寨的那天，正是滇南佧瓦山的漫长雨季中一个难得的晴天。在工作组的屋子里，一个用竹子编的小桌子上面摆了一些小药瓶、药膏和简单的医疗器材，像普通连队卫生员的家一样，设备不很多却摆得很整齐。在这佧瓦山里，医务人员还很缺乏的时候，想不到这个工作组里能有个卫生员，我不由兴奋地说：“你们组不错呀！还有卫生员。”
    “我们这里的卫生员是业余卫生员，是咱们组里的张高隆兼带着搞。”工作组的一个组员回答。
    张高隆这名字对我虽然陌生，但在这附近十几个佧瓦族、拉祜族寨子里，却是人人都熟悉的。大家都知道工作组有个张高隆会给他们讲毛主席的道理、会给他们办事、还会给他们治病。
    我在大力索寨住的那些日子，每天总看到许多佧瓦族人、拉祜族人来找张高隆，请他看病。不论是白天、黄昏，或者是深夜，张高隆只要在家，他就会“有求必应”地给那些来求医的人诊治。有一次，远处寨子里有个拉祜族的小孩背了袋黄果来，他一看张高隆不在家，就默默地坐在门外边等着。张高隆一回来，这孩子就欢呼着跑了上去，用拉祜话和张高隆谈着，张高隆也用他那不很熟练的拉祜话回答着。突然，我看见那孩子把那袋黄果送了过来，又被张高隆红着脸推了回去。原来这小孩患过病，是张高隆给治好的，他就拿黄果来一定要送给张高隆吃。
    有一次，工作组的张组长要到南欲寨去工作，我也跟了去。南欲寨就在大力索寨对面的山头上，但走起来却有四、五十里路，要从刮着刺人冷风的山头上下到那赤裸着上身还淌汗的南项河谷，还要走过悬在半空中的藤索桥。
    我们到的时候正是中午，寨子里的拉祜族人都还在地里没有回来，只有些孩子们随着狗吠声，从竹楼里奔出来，跑着、叫着：“解放军叔叔来了，解放军叔叔来了。”
    一位美丽的拉祜族少妇背了捆柴迎上来。组长告诉我：这少妇叫娜拉，是南欲寨头人扎依的姑娘，有一次她病得很危险，也是张高隆给治好的。
    那是一九五四年的八月，正是雨季，整天大风大雨，一连十几天都难得见一次晴天。就在这时，娜拉病了，患的是肠胃疟疾，一到了晚上就肚子痛，全身发烧，病很重也来得很猛。祖先传下来的杀鸡祭鬼办法，丝毫不能减轻病势。年老的母亲和壮年的丈夫在悲痛中想起了毛主席和解放军派驻在大力索寨的工作组，想起了那里面有个张高隆。也许他会有办法吧！他们就连夜派人冒着大雨，渡过浊浪翻滚的南项河，赶到工作组来请求派张高隆去诊治。
    遇见这种情况，在人民军队中，任何人也不会因为是下雨又是晚上而推辞的。张高隆带着一些药和另外一个同志出发了。
    从大力索寨到南项河边的三十多里路，全是陡滑的下坡路，又是伸手不见五指的大雨夜。他们不是走着，几乎是三步一跤、五步一滑地滚着，满身都被污泥和雨水湿透了，嘴巴和鼻子里填满了泥水。就在快到南欲寨的时候，张高隆脚下一滑，跌出两丈多远。等他费力爬起来时，右脚跌坏了，阵阵的疼痛使他站也站不住。可是，还是要前进啊！那垂危的病人正等待他诊治呢！强烈的责任心督促着他，还是咬紧牙关让那位同志搀扶着一步一挨地往前走。到达南欲寨时，他的右脚已经肿胀得不能穿鞋子了。但他还是忍住自己的疼痛，立即对病人进行了诊治。现在，这个少妇已恢复了健康。
    我感到有些奇怪：张高隆懂得医务，在边疆医务人员还很缺乏的时候，照理应该让他当卫生员，怎么调他到这工作组里来了呢？关于这一问题，张高隆后来告诉我：他是一九四九年参加云南的地方游击队的，那时他只有十五岁，个子还没有步枪高。最初是当通讯员。游击队和正规部队合编以后，他被调到医训队去学习了六个月，毕业后又在某团的卫生队里当了一年多的卫生员。
    那时，年轻的张高隆心里想：哪里也没有到战斗班当战士好，因此曾几次要求调换工作。一九五二年春天部队整编时，上级批准了他的要求，把他调去当战士。他的目的达到了，非常高兴。几年来他随着部队战斗在澜沧江两岸，每一次战斗都表现了勇敢和机智，在一九五三年五月又光荣地加入了中国新民主主义青年团。
    一九五三年秋天，由于佧瓦山民族工作的需要，要从部队抽调一批同志去增强原有的工作组。张高隆也被抽调了。
    到了工作组以后，他整天在佧瓦和拉祜族人的寨子里工作，这使他比过去更深刻地了解到佧瓦山人民由于长期处在国民党反动派统治下所过的痛苦生活。他看到这一带的人民因为无力战胜疾病，有了病就杀猪、杀牛、杀鸡来祭鬼，有个病人为了祭鬼，把生产用的牲畜都杀尽了，又把自己最后的一口锅也卖了来买鸡祭鬼，结果病还是没有好。佧瓦山的医务人员还很少，只能有重点地在几个大部落工作，暂时不可能到这些偏僻角落来。张高隆想到：也许自己那浅薄的医学常识，暂时能有些用处吧。
    经上级同意，他在一九五四年七月开始了他的业余卫生员工作。他的医学常识有限，不懂的就翻参考书，遇见更困难的问题，就跑到附近的连队里去请教那里的卫生指导员，或者回大队部去请医疗小组的同志来帮忙。他对人民的热爱使他战胜了许多困难。
    佧瓦山里都是大山，但在南项河边上却有一块稀有的平坦坦的坝子。也不知道是多少年前的事了，傣族人曾在这里开过水田。由于峡谷中气候闷热，疟疾特别容易蔓延，种水田的人多半病死了，剩下的傣族人不敢再在那里居住，也都搬往别处。长久以来，越传越恐怖，这一带的人都说那里有鬼，田开不得，人去了就会死。解放以后，福佬寨的拉祜族人也想去开那块水田，发展生产。可是他们还是怀疑那坝子上有鬼。
    工作组根据福佬寨人的种种顾虑进行了一再的解释，又贷给了谷种、农具，赠给了药品，福佬寨的人才放心地下去开荒了。住在山头上的人下坝子，对气候确实是一时难以习惯。最初几天就病倒了很多人。暗藏的坏分子乘机造谣：“鬼又来了，赶快回山头去吧！”谣言迷惑了仍然迷信鬼神的拉祜族人，很多人动摇了，准备再回到山头上去。就在这时，工作组派张高隆及时赶来，经过检查，病人几乎患的都是疟疾。他住在寨子里给拉祜族人服了奎宁，给病重的人打了针。这以后，西盟医疗组的同志也到这里对病人进行了多次治疗。害病的人都逐渐好了，拉祜族人这才相信：那不是鬼，是疟疾。以后他们习惯了这里的气候，开荒的劲头更大了。去年秋季，真是一片丰收景象，金黄的稻子长得比人还高，喜得福佬寨的拉祜族人只是拍手，说：“这是共产党、毛主席和解放军同志的恩情啊！没有他们，我们那里开得成这块水田！”收获的时候，全寨的几十户人家，每户都拿出了一部分新米，派人背着，跑了三十多里上山路送到大力索寨，一定要工作组的同志也尝尝新。
    就这样，张高隆从一九五四年七月到十月底，一共诊治了一千七百九十多个人，外科治疗还没计算在内。我想：要是没有张高隆这业余卫生员，会有多少淳朴的拉祜族人、佧瓦族人被死神带走啊！
    我临走的那天，张高隆正背着药包在各个寨子来回奔走，上级给他的任务是给那一带的两万个佧瓦、拉祜族人点种牛痘。他还兴奋的告诉我：上级决定，再过几个月这里就要设立一个医疗小组了，那时，这一带人民的健康就会更有保障了。
