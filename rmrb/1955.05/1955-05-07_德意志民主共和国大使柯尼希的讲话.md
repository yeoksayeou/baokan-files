Comrade Chairman, dear comrades and friends!

　　The German people celebrate on May 8 the tenth anniversary of their liberation from the fascist yoke by the glorious Soviet army. With the destruction of the Hitler state, imperialist Germany also ceased to exist; the Soviet Union liberated the peoples of Europe and the German people themselves from fascist barbarism. Therefore, allow me to first express my deepest gratitude to our liberator - the mighty and invincible Soviet Union.

　　The world-historic victory of the Soviet army over Hitler Germany opened up new prospects for the German people, enabling them to begin a new, truly democratic life in an environment of peace, happiness, and prosperity, thus beginning a new chapter in German history.

　　Due to the Western imperialist countries' sabotage of the Potsdam Agreement, the principles of the Potsdam Agreement have only been realized in eastern Germany.

　　The working class in eastern Germany learned from their own history, overcame division, and established their Marxist-Leninist party - the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Under the leadership of the united working class, an alliance of anti-fascist democratic parties was formed, with the aim of establishing a new anti-fascist democratic system based on the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. The working people thus carried out revolutionary transformations of the economy and politics. The land reform ended the rule of the Junker landlords, returning the landlords' land to the laboring peasants, thereby crushing the most rampant pillar of the reactionaries and militarism. At the same time, the land reform laid a solid foundation for the establishment of a worker-peasant alliance, promoting the democratic reform of the then-backward rural areas. By eliminating monopoly capital and depriving Nazis and war criminals of their means of production, the rule of the exploiters was crushed, and a state-owned economy was established. By purging the Nazi poison from the economic and administrative sectors, the fascist toxins in social life were eradicated.

　　The democratic reform in education shattered the privileged access to education for the propertied class, opened the doors of all schools and educational institutions to the children of the working people, and created the conditions for educating our youth in the spirit of peace and friendship among all nations. All these great achievements were only possible because the Soviet Union gave the working people of the German Democratic Republic comprehensive and selfless assistance after liberation.

　　The development of West Germany is completely different. The Western imperialist countries treated the Potsdam Agreement as a scrap of paper. They supported the forces of German imperialism, militarism, and fascism. In West Germany, the economic institutions of German monopoly capitalists and the fascist administrative machinery were retained intact.

　　The Western countries finally established the separate state of Bonn in 1949, directly and openly dividing Germany. This created an intolerable national crisis for the German people, thus arousing the indignant people's national self-help actions and establishing the German Democratic Republic. This has forever prevented the attempt to subject all of Germany to the whips of militarism and capitalism and drag the entire Germany onto the path of war.

　　With the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, for the first time a truly democratic, peace-loving German state emerged, which J. V. Stalin called a turning point in European history. The power of the German Democratic Republic is in the hands of the working class and laboring peasants. The worker-peasant regime relies on all the democratic and patriotic forces of the German people. People from all walks of life united in the National Front of Democratic Germany are fighting for peace and the reunification of Germany, for improving the people's happy life, and for consolidating the democratic foundations of the republic.

　　The achievements of the working people of the German Democratic Republic in restoring and developing various sectors of the national economy and culture, and since 1952 in building the foundations of socialism, are significant. Economic construction was once very arduous. But today, our country is independent and free of debt, a country where all achievements are due to the people's own strength and initiative, a country where life and labor are meaningful.

　　The German Democratic Republic has established new and huge heavy industry and machine manufacturing factories, such as metallurgical plants, power plants, coal mines, shipyards, machine factories, and tractor factories, thus providing a foundation for our peaceful economy. The total industrial output value of the German Democratic Republic in the first four years of the first five-year plan increased by 76 percent, doubling the highest production volume of fascist Germany in 1936. Agriculture has also made great achievements, with harvests improving year by year and livestock numbers increasing significantly. There are currently 5,120 agricultural production cooperatives, with cultivated land accounting for 14.83 percent of the total agricultural land. Six hundred and five machine tractor stations with 2,200 branch stations and 27,400 tractors are increasingly becoming the center of rural economic technology and political culture, and they are the most important tool for consolidating and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance.

　　With the development of the national economy, the reconstruction of cities destroyed in Hitler's war and the construction of entirely new cities are also progressing. Houses, cultural centers, schools, and theaters have been rebuilt, cultural monuments have been restored, and sports fields have been built in cities and villages. The German Democratic Republic is constantly concerned with inheriting and developing national culture, the education of the broad working people, health care, and social welfare. In 1950, there were only twenty universities, colleges, and independent academies; by 1954, there were forty-six. Expenditures in culture and science in 1954 had doubled compared to 1951. Literature has also achieved continuous development. The number of books published increases year by year. Millions of working people have become readers of excellent works of past and modern German national literature and world literature. The fine arts and music have gained new momentum, new ideological content, and realistic significance in expressing the better lives of the working people under the worker-peasant regime.

　　The material life of the working people has also become more affluent. Through sixteen large-scale price reductions and by lowering taxes and increasing wages, the purchasing power of the working people has been greatly improved. Although the retail trade volume had already reached the 1955 target by 1953, it increased by 14 percent in 1954 compared to 1953. In 1950, the average monthly wage in state-owned industries was 261 marks; by 1953, it had increased to 337 marks. These simple figures demonstrate the growing welfare of the working people of the German Democratic Republic, the main source of which is the enthusiasm and selfless labor of workers and peasants, laboring intellectuals, craftsmen and industrialists, especially production innovators, activists, meritorious technicians, and scientists.

　　Another reason for the prosperity of the German Democratic Republic is the ideological and material assistance from the Soviet Union and the economic cooperation and mutual assistance between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other friendly people's democratic countries. Due to these facts, the working people of the German Democratic Republic are able to look back on the great victories they have achieved under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which are having a strong demonstration effect on West Germany.

　　However, the German people are also celebrating the tenth anniversary of liberation in a situation where the national crisis is extremely acute. This situation has arisen because the Bonn parliamentary majority, disregarding the people and only obeying the United States, has ratified the Paris Agreements, which is an act of treason. It was passed against the will of the majority of the German people, ignoring the protests and opposition of the majority of the people, including the people of West Germany. Implementing the Paris Agreements means the resurgence of German militarism in West Germany, West Germany's participation in the US war treaty system, and preparing for a war against the German Democratic Republic, that is, preparing for a civil war in which Germans fight Germans. Implementing the Paris Agreements means that the American and German imperialists are preparing for a war of aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Once the Paris war agreements are implemented, they will threaten the survival of the German nation. The German working class and all patriotic Germans will never agree to the treasonous acts of the pro-American government in Bonn and its cobbled-together parliamentary majority. The German people do not want to fight, do not want to build a new Wehrmacht under the command of the United States and the orders of Hitler's generals. The German people need peace and the reunification of their motherland on a democratic basis. Therefore, the Paris Agreements must be abolished, agreements that indefinitely deepen the division of Germany, turn West Germany into a breeding ground for war, and threaten peace in Europe.

　　At this critical juncture, the task of the German people is to greatly strengthen the national struggle against the American war and enslavement conspiracy. Now it lies in establishing the unity of action of the entire German working class in the struggle against the remilitarization of West Germany and the Paris war agreements, and uniting all patriotic forces - workers, peasants, intellectuals, craftsmen, and the middle class - to fight.

　　In view of the Adenauer group's treasonous acts, the historical significance of the German Democratic Republic, as the reliable fortress of all patriotic and democratic forces of the German people striving to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, has increased. Since its inception, the government of the German Democratic Republic has strived to establish a unified Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis, to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, and to withdraw the occupying forces. The proposals repeatedly put forward by the People's Chamber and the government, the various parties and people's organizations, clearly express the will of the German people to demand peace and restore reunification, and point out the path to realizing this will.

　　In the German people's struggle for national rights, the Soviet Union has always shown that it is a true friend who respects and defends the national interests of our people under any circumstances, and points out the path to a peaceful solution to the German question through constructive proposals. The Soviet Union has consistently and unremittingly supported the just national demands of the German people on the international stage, both in the past and now. This policy of the Soviet Union has been wholeheartedly welcomed and enthusiastically supported by all patriotic and peaceful people in Germany. However, the Adenauer group and its masters are unwilling to ease international tensions and want to prepare for new wars. They are unwilling to peacefully resolve the German question and want to keep Germany divided forever, turning West Germany into a breeding ground for war.

　　But the patriotic forces are stronger than the traitors, because they are fighting for a just cause, and this just cause will surely prevail. The German Democratic Republic will continue to implement a policy of peace and consultation.

　　"Germans to one table!" This is the slogan of the struggle for unity and peace. Experience shows that a peaceful solution to the German question is not only necessary but also possible, just like the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. The prerequisite is that all parties have the same willingness. The positive results of the Geneva Conference and the achievements of the Asian-African Conference emphasize this fact. Representatives from both parts of Vietnam rejoined a negotiating table at the Asian-African Conference, thus helping to considerably satisfy the wishes of the Asian-African people and the people of the world for this historic conference.

　　The results of the Moscow talks on the Austrian issue once again prove that the path of resolving international disputes through consultation can achieve positive results. The Soviet-Austrian agreement clearly points out to the German people that the possibility of resolving the German question still exists. To achieve this, the Paris Agreements must be abolished, West Germany must not participate in aggressive military alliances, foreign military bases must be rejected in West Germany, and the path of consultation and peace must be taken.

　　Therefore, abolishing the Paris war agreements and Germans negotiating with each other on the issue of peaceful and democratic reunification remain the most pressing demands at present. The German Democratic Republic is working to achieve this demand, and the West German working class and all patriotic forces, regardless of all persecution, the arrest and imprisonment of German patriots, and all prohibitions, are fighting ever more strongly to achieve this demand.

　　In this struggle, the German Democratic Republic and the German people have powerful friends. The German Democratic Republic has gained international prestige and trust due to its policy of peace and friendship with all nations; it has become a solid component of the peace camp led by the Soviet Union. In contrast to the "policy of strength" pursued by American imperialists, which is actually a policy of weakness, the countries of the peace camp are closely united. The Moscow Conference on ensuring peace in Europe showed the world the unity of will, views, and purposes of the participating countries, and showed the invincible strength of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. The German Democratic Republic, together with the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, will take all measures in accordance with the Moscow Conference declaration to defend and guarantee the achievements of the German Democratic Republic and the national interests of the German people, and will resolutely fight against the implementation of the Paris war agreements. The German people have gained the sympathy and full support of the world peace camp in their just national struggle. The German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China are inextricably linked. In the five years since the establishment of our two countries, our unity, cooperation in politics, economy, and culture has become increasingly close, active, and extensive. This friendly cooperative relationship not only contributes to the interests of our two peoples and construction endeavors, but also helps to strengthen the peace and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union and to defend peace. The joint communique of the meeting between the prime ministers of China and Germany on July 25, 1954, specifically stated the significance of this mutual support and cooperation for the cause of peace.

　　Another measure of great significance for the development of our two countries' relations is the end of the state of war between the People's Republic of China and Germany. The order of the Chairman of the People's Republic of China on ending the state of war between the People's Republic of China and Germany stated:

　　"The People's Republic of China firmly supports the German Democratic Republic and the entire German people, as well as the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and peoples, in their struggle to achieve the peaceful reunification of Germany, to promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, to ensure collective security in Europe, and to safeguard world peace."

　　This statement, like the People's Republic of China's support for the Moscow Conference on ensuring peace in Europe, is a brilliant example of the People's Republic of China's valuable assistance to the German people and to ensuring peace in Europe. At the same time, the Chinese people have gained the full sympathy and support of the German people in their just struggle against imperialist aggression in Asia and to liberate Taiwan, an inseparable part of China.

　　Our two peoples, like the peoples of all countries in the peace camp, love peace and are doing everything in their power to defend and maintain peace.

　　The results of the historically significant Bandung Conference mean a great achievement for the cause of peace, peaceful coexistence, and cooperation. The delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, through its significant role in the achievements of this conference, made an invaluable contribution not only to the Asian and African peoples, but also to all peace-loving peoples in the world, including the German people. We sincerely congratulate the People's Republic of China on this great achievement.

　　The world's peace forces have grown irresistibly and are growing day by day. The world peace camp led by the Soviet Union is many times stronger than the forces of war. Our cause is invincible. Peace will surely triumph over war.

　　Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German peoples!

　　Long live our liberator, the great leader of the peace camp and the loyal friend of our two peoples - the mighty Soviet Union!

　　Long live the invincible peace camp and world peace!

### 德意志民主共和国大使柯尼希的讲话

专栏：

　　德意志民主共和国大使柯尼希的讲话主席同志，亲爱的同志们、朋友们！
    德国人民在五月八日庆祝光荣的苏联军队把他们从法西斯枷锁下解放出来的十周年。随着希特勒国家的被消灭，帝国主义的德国也停止了生存；苏联从法西斯野蛮统治下解放了欧洲各国人民和德国人民自己。因此，请允许我首先向我们的解放者——强大的和不可战胜的苏联表示最深厚的感谢之意。
    苏联军队战胜希特勒德国的世界历史性的胜利，向德国人民展开了新的远景，使他们有可能在和平、幸福与繁荣的环境中，开始新的、真正民主的生活，从而就在德国历史上开始了新的一章。
    由于西方帝国主义国家破坏了波茨坦协定，到现在为止只有在德国东部才实现了波茨坦协定的各项原则。
    德国东部的工人阶级从他们自己的历史中吸取了教训，克服了分裂状况，建立了他们的马克思列宁主义的政党——德国统一社会党。在统一的工人阶级的领导下，组成了反法西斯民主党派联盟，其宗旨是根据波茨坦协定原则建立一个新的反法西斯民主制度。劳动人民就这样地对经济和政治进行了革命性的改造。土地改革结束了容克地主的统治，把地主的土地交还给劳动农民，从而就粉碎了反动派和军国主义最猖獗的支柱。同时，土地改革为建立工农联盟打下了巩固的基础，促进了到那时为止还是落后的农村的民主改革。通过消灭垄断资本和剥夺纳粹分子和战犯的生产资料，粉碎了剥削者的统治，建立了国营经济。通过清除经济和行政部门的纳粹余毒，肃清了社会生活中的法西斯毒素。
    教育方面的民主改革粉碎了有产者的受教育特权，为劳动人民子女打开了所有学校和教育机构的大门，创造了以和平和各国人民友好的精神教育我国青年的条件。所有这一切巨大的成就之所以可能，只是因为苏联在解放后给予了德意志民主共和国劳动人民全面无私的援助。
    西德的发展则完全不同。西方帝国主义国家把波茨坦协定当作一张废纸。他们扶植了德国帝国主义、军国主义和法西斯主义的势力。在西德，德国垄断资本家的经济机构和法西斯的行政机器都原封不动地被保留下来。
    西方国家最后在一九四九年建立了波恩分立国家，直接和公开地分裂了德国。这就为德国人民造成了难以容忍的民族危机，从而激起了愤慨的人民的民族自救行动，建立了德意志民主共和国。这样就使全德重新屈服在军国主义和资本主义的皮鞭下、并把整个德国拖上战争道路的企图永远不能得逞了。
    随着德意志民主共和国的建立，第一次出现了一个真正民主的、爱好和平的德意志国家，约·维·斯大林把这称作是欧洲历史的转折点。德意志民主共和国的政权掌握在工人阶级和劳动农民的手里。工农政权依靠着德国人民的一切民主爱国的力量。团结在民主德国全国阵线内的各阶层人民为争取和平和统一德国、争取提高人民美好的生活和巩固共和国的民主基础而斗争。
    德意志民主共和国劳动人民在恢复和发展国民经济各部门和文化方面以及一九五二年以来在建设社会主义基础中所获得的成就是重大的。经济建设曾经是很艰巨的。但是今天，我们的国家是自主和没有债务的，是一个一切成就都归功于人民自己的力量和积极性的国家，在这个国家里，生活和劳动都是很有意义的。
    德意志民主共和国建立了新的巨大的重工业和机器制造业工厂，如冶金工厂、发电厂、煤矿、造船厂、机器厂和拖拉机工厂等，从而就为我国和平经济提供了基础。德意志民主共和国第一个五年计划头四年的工业生产总值增加了百分之七十六，比法西斯德国生产量最高的时期一九三六年增加了一倍。农业也获得了巨大成就，收成一年比一年好，牲畜头数也大大增加了。目前共有五千一百二十个农业生产合作社，耕地占全部农业耕种面积的百分之十四点八三。六百零五个拥有二千二百个分站和两万七千四百台拖拉机的机器拖拉机站，日益成为农村经济技术和政治文化的中心，它们是巩固和加强工农联盟的最重要的工具。
    随着国民经济的发展，重建在希特勒战争中被毁的城市以及建设完全新的城市同样在向前进展。住宅、文化馆、学校和剧院重又建立起来，修复了文化纪念场所，并在城市和乡间修建了体育运动场。德意志民主共和国经常关怀的是继承和发扬民族文化、广大劳动人民的教育、保健事业和社会福利事业。一九五○年时还只有二十所大学、高等学校和独立的学院，到一九五四年时就有四十六所了。文化和科学方面的经费一九五四年已增加到一九五一年的两倍。文学方面也获得了不断的发展。书籍的出版数量一年比一年增加。千百万劳动人民成为过去和现代德国民族文学和世界文学的优秀作品的读者。造型艺术和音乐在工农政权下获得了新的动力、新的思想内容和表现劳动人民更美好生活的现实意义。
    劳动人民的物质生活也变得更加富裕了。通过十六次大规模的减低物价以及通过降低税收和增加工资，劳动人民的购买力有了大大的提高。虽然零售贸易额到一九五三年时就已达到一九五五年的目标，但一九五四年又比一九五三年增加了百分之十四。一九五○年国营工业平均工资每月是二百六十
  一马克，到一九五三年时便已增加到三百三十七马克了。这些简单的数字表明了德意志民主共和国劳动人民日益增长的福利，这种福利的主要根源就是工人和农民、劳动知识分子、手工业者和工商业家，特别是生产革新者、积极分子、有功技术人员和科学家的热情和忘我劳动。
    德意志民主共和国繁荣的另一原因，是苏联在思想上和物质上的援助以及德意志民主共和国同苏联、中华人民共和国和其他各友好的人民民主国家之间的经济合作和互助。由于这些事实，德意志民主共和国劳动人民能够回顾他们在德国统一社会党领导下获得的伟大胜利，这些胜利正在对西德产生着强烈的示范作用。
    但是，德国人民同时也是在民族危机极其尖锐化的局势下庆祝解放十周年的。这种局势是由于不顾人民只顺从美国的波恩议会多数批准了巴黎协定而产生的，批准巴黎协定是卖国行为。它是在违背大多数德国人民的意志、无视包括西德人民在内的大多数人民的抗议和反对的情况下通过的。实施巴黎协定就意味着德国军国主义在西德重新抬头、西德参加美国的战争公约体系和准备一场反对德意志民主共和国的战争，也就是说，准备一场德国人打德国人的内战。实施巴黎协定就意味着美德帝国主义者准备一场侵犯苏联和各人民民主国家的战争。巴黎战争协定一旦付诸实施，就会威胁到德意志民族的生存。德国工人阶级和一切具有爱国意识的德国人，永远不会同意波恩亲美政府及其拼凑起来的议会多数的卖国行为。德国人民不愿意打仗，不愿意建立受美国指挥和希特勒将领命令的新国防军。德国人民需要和平，需要在民主基础上重新统一他们的祖国。因此，必须废除巴黎协定，废除那些无限期地加深德国分裂、把西德变为战争温床并威胁着全欧和平的协定。
    在这个严重关头，德国人民的任务就是大大地加强反对美国战争和奴役阴谋的民族斗争。现在就在于在反对西德重新军国主义化和巴黎战争协定的斗争中，建立全德工人阶级的行动一致，并团结一切爱国力量——工人、农民、脑力劳动者和手工业者以及中产阶层进行斗争。
    鉴于阿登纳集团的卖国行为，作为德国人民一切爱国民主力量为建立统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国而奋斗的可靠堡垒，德意志民主共和国的历史意义提高了。德意志民主共和国政府自从它成立的最初日子起，就努力争取在民主和平基础上建立统一的德国、缔结对德和约和撤退占领军队。人民议院和政府、各政党和人民团体一再提出的建议，清楚地表达了德国人民要求和平、恢复统一的意志，并指出了实现这一意志的道路。
    在德国人民争取民族权利的斗争中，苏联一直表明它是在任何情况下尊重和维护我国人民民族利益，并通过建设性的建议指出了和平解决德国问题的道路的真正朋友。苏联在国际舞台上，过去和现在都始终不懈地支持着德国人民的正义的民族要求。苏联这种政策受到了德国一切爱国和平人士的衷心欢迎和热烈拥护。但是，阿登纳集团及其主子不愿缓和国际紧张局势，而是想准备新战争。他们不愿意和平解决德国问题，而是想使德国永远分裂下去，把西德变成战争温床。
    但是，爱国力量比卖国贼强大，因为他们为正义事业而斗争，而这个正义的事业一定会胜利。德意志民主共和国将继续贯彻和平和协商的政策。
  “德国人到一张桌子旁边来！”，这就是争取统一与和平的斗争的口号。经验说明，和平解决德国问题不但是必要的，而且也是可能的，正像具有不同社会制度的国家的和平共处一样。前提就是各方面都怀有同样的意愿。日内瓦会议的积极结果和亚非会议的成就强调出了这一事实。越南两部分的代表在亚非会议上重新坐到一张谈判桌子旁，从而就有助于相当地满足了亚非人民和世界人民对这次历史性的会议的愿望。
    关于奥地利问题的莫斯科会谈的结果再次证明，通过协商解决国际争端的道路是能够获得积极结果的。苏奥协议向德国人民明确地指出，解决德国问题的可能性现在也还是存在的。为了做到这一步，就必须废除巴黎协定，西德不参加侵略性的军事同盟，拒绝外国在西德建立军事基地，并走上协商与和平的道路。
    因此，废除巴黎战争协定和德国人之间就和平民主恢复统一问题进行协商，仍一直是当前最迫切的要求。德意志民主共和国正在为实现这一要求而努力，西德工人阶级和一切爱国力量不顾一切迫害、不顾德国的爱国志士被捕入狱和一切禁令，越来越坚强地为实现这一要求而进行斗争。
    在这场斗争中，德意志民主共和国和德国人民有着强大的朋友。德意志民主共和国由于它的和平和各国人民友好的政策而获得了国际威望和信任；它已成了以苏联为首的和平阵营的一个坚固的组成部分。和美国帝国主义者所推行的实际上是一种软弱政策的“实力政策”相反，和平阵营各国紧密地团结在一起。保障欧洲和平的莫斯科会议向全世界表明了与会各国的意志、见解和目的的一致性，显示了和平、民主和社会主义阵营的不可战胜的力量。德意志民主共和国将同苏联和其他兄弟国家一起，根据莫斯科会议宣言采取一切措施，来保卫和保障德意志民主共和国的成果和德国人民的民族利益，并坚决地进行反对实施巴黎战争协定的斗争。德国人民在他们的正义的民族斗争中获得了世界和平阵营的同情和充分支持。德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国亲密不可分地团结在一起。在我们两国成立的五年以来，我们在政治、经济和文化方面的团结合作已日益密切、积极和广泛。这种友好合作关系不仅有助于我们两国人民和建设事业的利益，而且也有助于增强以苏联为首的和平民主力量和保卫和平。一九五四年七月二十五日中德两国总理会谈公报，特别说明了这种互相支持和合作的关系对和平事业的意义。
    对我们两国关系的发展具有重大意义的另一措施，就是中华人民共和国和德国之间的战争状态的结束。中华人民共和国主席关于结束中华人民共和国同德国之间的战争状态的命令说：
      “中华人民共和国坚决支持德意志民主共和国和全德人民以及苏联和所有爱好和平的国家和人民为争取德国和平统一、促进对德和约的缔结、保障欧洲集体安全和维护世界和平的斗争”。
    这个声明就像中华人民共和国支持保障欧洲和平的莫斯科会议一样，是中华人民共和国给予德国人民和对保障欧洲和平的宝贵援助的光辉范例。同时，中国人民在反对帝国主义在亚洲的侵略活动和解放中国不可分割的一部分——台湾的正义斗争中，也获得德国人民的充分同情和支持。
    我们两国人民如同和平阵营各国人民一样，热爱和平并以全力来保卫和维护和平。
    具有历史意义的万隆会议的结果，意味着和平、和平共处和合作事业的伟大成就。以周恩来总理为首的中华人民共和国代表团通过它对这次会议成就的重大作用，不但为亚非人民，而且也为世界上一切爱好和平的人民，其中也包括德国人民，作出了无可估计的贡献。我们向中华人民共和国衷心地祝贺它所取得的这一伟大成就。
    世界和平力量已有了不可遏止的增长，并且正在与日俱增。在苏联领导下的世界和平阵营比战争势力强大许多倍。我们的事业是不可战胜的。和平一定会战胜战争。
    德中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    我们的解放者、和平阵营的伟大领袖和我们两国人民的忠实朋友——强大的苏联万岁！
    不可战胜的和平阵营和世界和平万岁！
