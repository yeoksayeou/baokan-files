Hot River, Shanxi, and Other Provinces Actively Expand Corn Planting Area

In order to rapidly increase grain production, many miscellaneous grain producing areas are preparing to plant high-yield crops - corn - this year. Hot River Province's corn planting area plan for this year is to expand from 600,000 mu in 1954 to 1.05 million mu. Shanxi Province plans to expand corn planting area by 1.3 million mu this year. Sichuan Province plans to utilize autumn fallow land to expand corn planting by 600,000 mu this year. Other provinces such as Shandong, Hebei, Guangxi, Jilin, and Liaoning have also expanded corn planting area according to local conditions. Many agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers in these areas have all formulated plans to expand corn planting. For example, 23 agricultural production cooperatives in the fifth district of Qian'an County, Hebei Province, plan to plant more than 1,000 mu of corn this year, an expansion of 46 percent compared to last year's corn planting area. In Jixing County, Heilongjiang Province, the corn planting area of 251 agricultural production cooperatives will account for more than 40 percent of the total grain crop area. In Baise Prefecture, Guangxi Province, spring corn was basically sown by the end of March. Xincheng County alone originally planned to plant 210,000 mu, but has now planted more than 273,000 mu, exceeding the plan by more than 63,000 mu.

While expanding the corn planting area, the agricultural departments in these miscellaneous grain producing areas have also paid attention to the work of popularizing corn planting techniques. For example, Shanxi Province is preparing to further promote improved corn varieties such as "Golden Queen", requiring that the planting area of improved varieties be expanded from 35 percent of the corn planting area in 1954 to 51.7 percent this year. In February this year, Luanping County, Hot River Province, held training classes on corn cultivation techniques in different districts, training a total of 650 agricultural technicians. At the beginning of this year, there were more than 2,600 farmer technicians from Zhuang, Yao, Han, Miao and other ethnic groups in Baise District, Guangxi Province, who received training in advanced corn planting techniques.

　　热河山西等省积极扩大玉米种植面积
    为了迅速提高粮食产量，今年许多杂粮产区都准备多种高产作物——玉米。热河省今年的玉米播种面积计划在一九五四年六十万亩的基础上扩大为一百零五万亩，山西省今年计划扩大玉米种植面积一百三十万亩，四川省今年计划利用秋闲地扩种玉米六十万亩，其他如山东、河北、广西、吉林、辽宁等省也都因地制宜地扩大了玉米种植面积。这些地区许多农业生产合作社、互助组和单干农民都订出了扩种玉米的计划。如河北省迁安县第五区二十三个农业生产合作社今年准备种玉米一千多亩，比去年的玉米种植面积扩大了百分之四十六。黑龙江省景星县二百五十一个农业生产合作社的玉米播种面积将占全部粮食作物面积的百分之四十多。广西省百色专区春玉米已在三月底基本播完，仅忻城一县原计划种二十一万亩，现已种下二十七万三千多亩，超过计划六万三千多亩。
    在扩大玉米种植面积的同时，这些杂粮产区的农业部门还注意了推广种植玉米技术的工作。如山西省准备进一步推广“金皇后”等玉米良种，要求今年良种的种植面积由一九五四年占玉米种植面积的百分之三十五扩大到百分之五十一点七。热河省滦平县今年二月，曾分区举办玉米栽培技术训练班，共训练了六百五十名农业技术员。今年年初，广西省百色区各县有僮、瑶、汉、苗等族农民技术员二千六百多人，受了种植玉米的先进技术的训练。
