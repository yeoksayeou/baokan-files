The Amugulang in the Hulunbuir Grassland of Inner Mongolia, the seat of the People's Government of the New Barag Left Banner, has gradually become the political and economic center of the pastoral area. Every two days, a regular bus departs from Hailar, a city on the grassland, directly to Amugulang. Herdsmen can take comfortable buses to travel on the grassland on time. The distance of 390 li can be covered in just over six hours. The post office delivers the People's Daily and the Mongolian version of the Inner Mongolia Daily published four or six days ago to here. The six freight trucks of the Banner Supply and Marketing Cooperative traveled more than 220,000 kilometers in 1954, carrying more than 2,000 tons of materials, transporting grain and industrial products to the grassland, and transporting animal products to the cities. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative has built a spacious store, and customers come from the grassland every day. From May 10th to 12th, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative sold more than 8,000 jin of grain, nearly 2,000 chi of cotton cloth, and more than 500 chi of silk, and purchased some leather, animal bones, felt pieces, and dozens of cattle and sheep. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also built a new bathroom where herdsmen can take showers. The Amugulang office of the People's Bank of China has been changed to a sub-branch. The outpatient department of the Banner Health Center provides medical services for an average of twenty herdsmen every day.

This year, Amugulang will also build new school buildings and expand the office space for banks, health centers, and postal institutions. Construction is now being prepared. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　草原上的新市镇
    内蒙古呼伦贝尔草原上的阿木古郎是新巴尔虎左翼旗旗人民政府所在地，现在已逐步成为牧区的政治、经济中心了。从草原上的城市海拉尔每隔两天就有一次定期客车直驶阿木古郎，牧民们可以按时乘坐舒适的客车来往在草原上，三百九十里的距离只要六个多小时就到了。邮政局把四天或六天前的人民日报和内蒙古日报蒙文版送到这里。旗供销合作社的六辆运货卡车，一九五四年共行驶二十二万多公里，载运了两千多吨物资，把粮食和工业品运到草原，又把畜产品运到城市。供销合作社新建了宽敞的门市部，每天都有来自草地的顾客。在五月十日到十二日供销社就售出了八千多斤粮食，近两千尺棉布和五百多尺绸子，又收购了一些皮张、畜骨、毡片和几十头牛、羊。供销社还新盖了一所浴室，牧民们可以到这里洗澡。中国人民银行阿木古郎办事处已经改成支行。旗卫生院的门诊部，平均每天要为二十来个牧民看病。
    今年，阿木古郎还要新建学校校舍，扩建银行、卫生院和邮政机构的用房。现在正筹备施工。　　　　　　（据新华社讯）
