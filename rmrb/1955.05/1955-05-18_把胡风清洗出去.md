　　Expel Hu Feng
　　Wang Changding
　　After reading the "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" exposed by Shu Wu, published in the "People's Daily" on May 13th, I was filled with endless anger! From the revealed facts, it can be seen that Hu Feng's attacks on the Party and the Party's literary and art policies were not only ideological but also political, echoing and cooperating with the Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique.

　　Let's not talk about his scolding of Party and non-Party progressive writers as "mandarin gowns," "philistines," "officials," "maggots," etc. Just look at how he echoed the Kuomintang in slandering Mr. Wen Yiduo! He said: "Wen Yiduo was certainly opportunistic, but he succeeded, so he must be flattered." Regarding the democratic fighter who was assassinated by special agents and whose blood was spilled on the land of Kunming as "opportunistic," who was Hu Feng speaking for? What was Hu Feng's position?

　　But the problem is not just this. He wanted to create a "smokescreen," use "grenade bundle tactics," and add "small strongholds" for "cooperation" to annihilate revolutionary literature and art. He was even vicious enough to think that the method of "using whips wrapped in rubber-coated steel wire to beat prisoners, causing injuries that are not visible on the surface" to treat revolutionary writers "is a good method." Didn't Chiang Kai-shek try to use Hu Feng's "tactics" to eliminate the revolution during the five counter-encirclement campaigns and the 25,000-mile Long March? Aren't the methods used by Kuomintang special agents to treat revolutionaries, such as pouring chili water, pouring gasoline, using pliers, and the tiger bench..., precisely Hu Feng's "good methods" that "cause injuries that are not visible on the surface"?

　　Hu Feng launched attacks on the revolution wearing a mask, continuing until after liberation. To this end, he wanted to occupy positions in Northeast China and Tianjin, and he issued a letter of challenge to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Even today, he still pretends to engage in "self-criticism," saying that he "regarded the revolutionariness and stance of the petty bourgeoisie as the revolutionariness and stance of the working class," which is completely a set of deceptive lies! As the editor's note in the "People's Daily" says: This is a "tactic of shifting from offense to retreat (i.e., self-examination)."

　　We must expose Hu Feng's disguise! We must not tolerate Hu Feng's deception! As a young literary worker, I demand that the Writers Association not only revoke all the positions held by Hu Feng (including the editorial board of "People's Literature") but also expel Hu Feng from the Writers Association. We cannot allow such an anti-Party political schemer to continue to mix in the revolutionary ranks and carry out his anti-Party and anti-people political activities!

### 把胡风清洗出去

　  把胡风清洗出去
    王昌定
    看了五月十三日“人民日报”所载舒芜揭露的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”，使我愤怒不止！从揭露的事实可以看出，胡风对党和党的文艺政策的进攻，不仅是思想上的，而且是政治上的，是同国民党反动统治集团互相呼应，互相配合的。
    且不谈他把党和非党的进步作家骂为“马褂”、
  “市侩”、“官们”、“蛆虫”……，只要看看他是怎样同国民党同一声气诬蔑闻一多先生吧！他说：“闻一多当然是投机，但他投中了，只好奉承他。”把被特务所暗杀、鲜血洒在昆明土地上的民主战士看成“投机”，胡风是在为谁说话呢？胡风是站在什么立场上呢？
    但，问题还不只此，他是要布成“疑阵”、用“集束手榴弹的战术”，并且加上“小据点”的
  “配合”，来歼灭革命文艺的，甚至狠毒到认为
  “用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”的办法，来对待革命作家，“是好方法”。难道在五次反围剿中，在二万五千里长征中，蒋介石不正企图用胡风的“战术”来消灭革命吗？难道国民党特务对待革命者所用的灌辣椒水、灌汽油、使用老虎钳子、坐老虎凳……，不正是胡风的“表面上看不出伤痕”的“好方法”吗？
    胡风戴着假面具向革命进攻，一直进行到解放以后，为此，他要在东北和天津占领阵地，他向中共中央提出了挑战书。并且直到今天还假惺惺地来什么“自我批判”，说什么“把小资产阶级的革命性和立场当作了工人阶级的革命性和立场”，完全是一套骗人的鬼话！正如“人民日报”编者按语中所说：这是“从进攻转变为退却（即检讨）的策略”。
    胡风的伪装，我们必须揭穿！胡风的欺骗，我们决不能忍受！作为一个青年的文学工作者，我要求作家协会不仅撤消胡风所担任的各项职务（包括
  “人民文学”的编委），而且应当把胡风从作家协会中清洗出去。我们不能让这样一个反党的政治阴谋家，继续混在革命队伍中，作他反党、反人民的政治勾当！
