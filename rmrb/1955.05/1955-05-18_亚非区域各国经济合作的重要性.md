　　The peoples of Asia and Africa, who account for more than half of the world's population, have suffered and are suffering from the disasters and harms of imperialist colonial aggression, have lived and are living the slave lives of colonies, and have been and are being persecuted by racial discrimination. Therefore, they all hold the desire to break free from the chains imposed on them by imperialist colonial policies. China once lived a semi-colonial life, and although it has now driven out imperialism, it still needs a considerable period of time to overcome the economic and cultural backwardness caused by colonial rule. The recently convened Asian-African Conference reflects a common aspiration and demand of Asian and African countries—namely, to oppose colonialism, strive for and safeguard national independence, oppose war, maintain peace, and enhance friendly relations between Asian and African countries.

　　To promote friendly relations between Asian and African countries, economic and cultural cooperation are also essential. The representatives of the twenty-nine countries participating in the conference reached an agreement in the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and announced the significant achievements of the conference to the peoples of Asia and Africa and the people of the world. At the same time, a resolution was also made on economic cooperation, stating: "The Asian-African Conference recognizes the urgency of promoting economic development in the Asian-African region, and there is a universal desire among the participating countries to implement economic cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual respect for national sovereignty." Why is promoting the economic development of Asian and African countries urgent? What constitutes economic cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual respect for national sovereignty? This is what we must first understand.

　　Asia and Africa account for one-half of the world's land area, and their natural resources are very rich. The peoples of Asia and Africa are diligent, brave, and peace-loving. China, India, and Egypt are among the oldest countries in the world, and have had brilliant cultures in history. However, since entering the nineteenth century, especially by the end of the nineteenth century, world capitalism had developed to the stage of imperialism. Except for Japan and Tsarist Russia, the countries of Asia and Africa had become colonies and dependencies of Western colonial countries to varying degrees, and the peoples of the Asian-African region had long fallen into the abyss of poverty and backwardness.

　　After World War II, the center of gravity of the world capitalist economic system shifted to the United States. Like in other parts of the world, the United States carried out extensive economic aggression against Asian and African countries. After launching the war of aggression against Korea, it implemented an "embargo" policy, restricting normal trade between Asian countries and hindering economic assistance and cooperation among Asian countries. According to statistics, in 1953, the trade volume between Asian countries was only 4.8 billion US dollars, which was only one-third of the total trade volume of Asian countries. The Asian market has become a dumping ground for surplus products from the United States, causing enormous economic losses to Asian countries. For example, the largest customer for Ceylon's only major export product, rubber, is the United States. Before preparing for the war of aggression against Korea, US imperialism had already purchased and stored a large amount of natural rubber. After launching the war of aggression against Korea, it reduced its purchases of Ceylon's rubber on the one hand, and prohibited Ceylon's rubber from being exported to China on the other, causing the price of rubber to plummet, and the Ceylon government's finances and the people's lives were plunged into desperation, while the US monopoly capitalists were able to obtain cheap raw materials and obtain maximum profits. In 1950 and 1951, India suffered a severe famine and wanted to purchase US grain to relieve the famine. The United States not only lost the compassion that humanity should have, but also took advantage of the situation to extort harsh conditions, resulting in the failure of the transaction. These are concrete examples of the extremely vicious treatment of Asian and African people by colonialists. We all realize that wherever the aggressive forces of imperialism extend, the people there suffer. No matter how good-hearted it pretends to be, the vast majority of Asian and African people can see through its mask. The people of Asian and African countries deeply feel that without shaking off the economic enslavement of imperialism, they cannot have their own independence and freedom, let alone prosperity and strength. Therefore, the awakened people of Asian and African countries have never stopped their struggle against colonialism.

　　Asian and African countries do not exclude economic cooperation with any country, but this cooperation must be based on equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. Since its establishment, the People's Republic of China, like the Soviet Union, has consistently pursued a peaceful policy and is committed to establishing equal and mutually beneficial trade relations with all countries. When India was suffering from a severe famine, the Chinese government was willing to supply India with rice, not only of superior quality but also at a fair price. When the Ceylon government and people were experiencing difficulties due to the sharp drop in rubber prices, the Chinese government was willing to conclude a five-year trade agreement for rubber and rice with the Ceylon government, raising rubber prices and increasing the income of the Ceylon government and people. According to the Ceylon trade delegation, if the same amount of rice were imported from the United States, twice the amount of rubber would have to be sent out. Although Japan is still under the control of US imperialism, the Japanese people are still rising up to fight, and in May, they signed the third trade agreement with our visiting delegation to Japan, with imports and exports each totaling 30 million pounds. Japan supplies China with machinery and industrial products, while China supplies Japan with mineral and agricultural products to meet the economic needs of both sides. Over the past five years, countries that have established trade relations with China have recognized the true meaning of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty.

　　Currently, these trade exchanges between Asian and African countries help stabilize the prices of certain commodities in trading countries and stabilize the lives of people in related countries. However, in terms of striving for independent and autonomous economic lives for each country, such trade is still far from enough. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to further strengthen economic cooperation between countries.

　　Imperialists are unwilling for Asian and African countries to embark on the path of economic prosperity and industrialization. Is it not obvious enough that US automobile companies would rather close down existing automobile assembly plants than establish automobile manufacturing plants in India? Conversely, after India signed a five-year trade agreement with the Soviet Union in 1953, it signed another agreement in February of this year, under which the Soviet Union will help India build a huge metallurgical complex with an annual output of one million tons of steel, lend India a loan at a low interest rate of 2.5% to be used as funds for building the plant, and use as much of the materials needed for building the plant as India can supply itself. The Soviet Union will supply India with new-style equipment that India does not have, and send experts to assist India in building the plant, and train Indian technical personnel. Administrative affairs are managed by India itself. The Indian people all recognize that these machines and equipment are what India has not been able to obtain from the United States or Britain for many years. China's economic recovery and development over the past five years and its march towards industrialization are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. We firmly believe that Soviet-Indian economic cooperation is an example for the further development of economic cooperation among Asian and African countries. This is fully in line with the common aspirations reflected in the Asian-African Conference. The second item in the final communique of the conference on economic cooperation reads: "The participating countries agree to provide each other with technical assistance to the greatest extent practically feasible, in the form of: experts, trainees, pilot projects and equipment, exchange of technical knowledge..."

　　In the future, in the increasingly close practice of economic cooperation, the people of Asian and African countries will increasingly recognize its importance, thereby increasing the friendly unity among the people of various countries, shaking off poverty and backwardness, and embarking on the road to independence, autonomy, and prosperity.

　　亚非区域各国经济合作的重要性
　　马寅初
    占全世界人口一半以上的亚洲和非洲的人民，曾经和正在受帝国主义殖民侵略的灾难和危害，曾经和正在过殖民地的奴隶生活，曾经和正在受种族歧视的迫害，因此他们都抱着摆脱帝国主义殖民政策所加于他们的锁链的愿望。中国曾经过半殖民地的生活，现在虽已把帝国主义赶走，然而仍需要相当长的时期来克服殖民统治所造成的经济和文化的落后状态。最近召开的亚非会议就是反映了亚非国家一种共同愿望和要求——就是反对殖民主义，争取和保障民族独立，反对战争，维护和平，并增进亚非各国之间的友好关系。
    要促进亚非国家间的友好关系，还有赖于经济合作和文化合作。参加会议的二十九个国家代表在求同存异的精神下达成了协议，向亚非人民和全世界人民宣告了会议的重大成就。同时在经济合作方面也作出决议说：“亚非会议认识到促进亚非区域的经济发展的迫切性，在与会国中存有在互利和互相尊重国家主权的基础上实行经济合作的普遍愿望。”为什么促进亚非区域各国经济发展是迫切的呢？怎样才算是在互利和互相尊重国家主权的基础上的经济合作呢？这是我们首先要了解的。
    亚非两洲的面积占世界面积的二分之一，天然物产是非常富饶的。亚非两洲的人民都是勤劳、勇敢和爱好和平的。中国、印度和埃及等国家是世界上最古老的国家，在历史上都有过光辉灿烂的文化。但自进入十九世纪以后，特别是到十九世纪的末期，世界资本主义已经发展到帝国主义的阶段，亚非两洲的国家除日本和沙皇俄国外都在不同程度上沦为西方殖民国家的殖民地和附属国，亚非区域各国人民遂长期陷入贫困与落后的深渊中。
    第二次世界大战后，世界资本主义经济体系的重心已经移到美国。和在世界各地一样，美国对亚非国家进行了广泛的经济侵略。它发动侵略朝鲜战争后，更实施“禁运”政策，束缚了亚洲各国间的正常贸易，阻挠了亚洲各国经济的互助与合作。据统计，一九五三年内亚洲各国间的贸易额仅有四十八亿美元，只等于亚洲各国贸易总额的三分之一。亚洲的市场已成为美国剩余产品的倾销地，使亚洲国家经济上受到莫大的损失。例如，锡兰唯一大宗出口产品橡胶的最大顾主是美国。美帝国主义在准备侵略朝鲜战争以前已经购储了大量天然橡胶，发动侵略朝鲜战争后，它一面减购锡兰的橡胶，一面又禁止锡兰橡胶输往中国，致使橡胶价格大跌，锡兰政府的财政和人民的生活都陷于绝境，而美国垄断资本家则能得到低廉的原料，获取最大限度的利润。一九五○年和一九五一年，印度遭受严重粮荒，曾想采购美国粮食来救荒，美国不仅丧失了人类应有的同情，反而乘人之危，勒索苛刻的条件，致交易不成。这些都是殖民主义者对待亚非人民穷凶极恶的具体事例。我们都体会到，帝国主义的侵略势力伸张到那里，那里的人民就遭殃，无论它装扮得如何好心肠，亚非人民的极大部分都能揭穿它的假面具。亚非各国人民深深感到，不摆脱帝国主义的经济奴役，就不能有自己的独立与自由，更说不上繁荣与富强。所以亚非各国已觉醒了的人民从没有停止过反对殖民主义的斗争。
    亚非各国并不排斥同任何国家实行经济合作，但这种合作必须是建立在平等互利和互相尊重领土主权的基础上的。中华人民共和国自成立之日起，与苏联一样，始终不渝地执行和平政策，并致力于同各国建立平等互利的贸易关系。当印度饥荒严重的时候，中国政府愿以大米供给印度，不但品质是上等的，而且价格是公道的。当锡兰政府和人民因橡胶价惨跌，遭到困难时候，中国政府愿同锡兰政府缔结橡胶和大米五年贸易协定，提高了橡胶价格，使锡兰政府和人民收入增加。据锡兰贸易代表团表示，如果从美国进口同等的大米则必须送出双倍数量的橡胶。日本虽然仍处在美帝国主义宰割之下，日本人民还是奋起斗争，在五月间又同我国访日代表团订立了进出口各三千万英镑的第三次贸易协定。日本以机器和工业品供给中国，中国则以矿产品和农产品供给日本，以满足双方的经济需要。五年以来，和中国建立了贸易关系的国家都认识到平等互利和互相尊重国家主权的真意义。
    目前存在亚非各国间的这些贸易来往有助于稳定贸易国间某些物品的价格，稳定有关国家人民的生活。但就争取各国独立自主的经济生活说来，这样的贸易还是很不够的。要达到这目的，必须进一步加强各国之间的经济合作。
    帝国主义者是不愿意亚非国家走上经济繁荣和工业化的道路的。美国的汽车公司为拒绝在印度建立汽车制造厂，而宁愿关闭已开设的汽车装配厂，这还不够明显吗？相反的，印度同苏联在一九五三年订立了五年贸易协定之后，到今年二月又订立了一个协定，由苏联帮助印度建立一个年产一百万吨钢的巨大冶金联合工厂，以百分之二点五低利贷与印度一笔借款充作建厂资金，建厂所需材料尽量利用印度自己所能供给的，苏联则供给印度所没有的新式装备，并且派遣专家协助印度建厂，训练印度技术人才，行政事务由印度自己管理。印度人民都认识到这些机器与装备都是印度多年以来没有能从美国或英国那里得到的。中国五年来经济的恢复和发展并正向工业化大道迈进，这与苏联和人民民主国家的无私帮助是分不开的。我们深信苏印的经济合作，是亚非国家进一步发展经济合作的范例。这是完全符合亚非会议所反映出的共同愿望的。会议最后公报关于经济合作的第二项写道：“与会国同意在实际可行的最大程度上互相提供技术援助，方式是：专家，受训人员，供示范用的工程计划和装备，交换技术知识……。”
    今后亚非各国人民将在日益密切的经济合作实践过程中，愈来愈多的认识到它的重要性，从而增加各国人民间的友好团结，摆脱贫困与落后，走上独立、自主和繁荣的大道。
