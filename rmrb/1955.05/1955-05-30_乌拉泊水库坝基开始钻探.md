Urumqi, May 9th - Drilling work has commenced on the dam foundation of the Ulabo Reservoir, located in the upper reaches of the Urumqi River, on May 9th. Drilling personnel are using impact electric drills to work on the perennially silted cobblestone layer of the reservoir dam foundation. Exploration trenching work is also being carried out simultaneously on both banks of the Urumqi River. Employees have expressed their determination to complete the drilling work in the flood channel before the onset of floods, striving to provide data for the formulation of the reservoir construction plan as soon as possible.

This valley reservoir is being built according to the planning recommendations for the Urumqi River made by Soviet water conservancy expert Voronin. The tentatively planned reservoir capacity is between 100 million and 150 million cubic meters, which is two to three times larger than the existing Hongyanchi Reservoir in Xinjiang Province, and four to five times larger than the Daquangou Reservoir currently under construction. Once the Ulabo Reservoir is completed, the Tian Shan snowmelt flowing into the Urumqi River each year can be fully controlled. In addition to being used for power generation to supply the needs of industry and various ethnic groups in Urumqi City, it can also expand the agricultural irrigation area by approximately 400,000 mu through the Heping Canal in the near suburbs of Urumqi City. The original Urumqi River riverbed will retain only a channel with waterfalls, traversing Urumqi City in a straight line to supply water for the residents of the urban area. The riverbed滩地 will become a construction site, thereby connecting the urban areas on the east and west banks; the threat of floods to the safety of the city can also be eliminated, and Urumqi City will become more prosperous and beautiful.

### 乌拉泊水库坝基开始钻探

　  乌拉泊水库坝基开始钻探
    位于乌鲁木齐河上游的乌拉泊水库坝基工程已在五月九日开始钻探。钻探人员用着冲击式电动钻机在水库坝基的多年淤积卵石层上工作，乌鲁木齐河两岸的坑探工作也在同时进行，员工们表示要在洪水暴发以前完成洪水道中的钻探工程，争取尽早给制定水库修建计划提出资料。
    这座山谷拦河水库是苏联水利专家沃洛宁根据乌鲁木齐河的规划建议修建的，暂定水库容量为一亿至一亿五千万立方公尺，比新疆省原有的红雁池水库大两三倍，比正在修建中的大泉沟水库大四五倍。乌拉泊水库建成后，每年流入乌鲁木齐河的天山溶雪流水可被全部控制，除利用来发电供应给工业和乌鲁木齐市各族居民需要外，并可通过乌鲁木齐市近郊的和平渠扩大农田灌溉面积约四十万亩。原有的乌鲁木齐河河床将只保留一条有跌水的渠道，笔直的穿越乌鲁木齐市，以供应市区居民用水；河床滩地将成为建筑场地，由此东西两岸市区就将联在一起；洪水对市区安全的威胁也可以免除，乌鲁木齐市将变得更加繁荣、美丽。
