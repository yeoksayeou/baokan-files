　　Consolidate Spring Afforestation Achievements and Strengthen Young Forest Tending
　　Lin Xuan
　　According to statistics from early May, the nation has afforested 815,734 hectares this spring. This is a significant achievement. To consolidate this achievement, all regions should focus on inspecting the quality of construction, thoroughly summarize experiences, and strive to do a good job in tending and protecting young forests.
　　In the past, some areas only paid attention to afforestation and neglected the tending and protection of young forests, resulting in low survival and preservation rates. The trees that farmers worked hard to plant soon died, which was a great waste for both the country and the masses.
　　The main methods for tending young forests are weeding and loosening the soil. This work is particularly important in the first three to four years after afforestation. In general areas, young forests should be tended three times in the first year, twice in the second year, and once in the third year. In areas with insufficient moisture, especially those with abundant weeds, it is necessary to increase the number of tending sessions to ensure the healthy growth of young trees. At the same time, all regions must find ways to prevent damage to trees by people, livestock, or wildfires.
　　It is essential to carry out propaganda and education work among the broad masses of farmers regarding tending young forests. Farmers must be told that trees are the fruits of their labor, and the trees they plant will not become public property. Even in a socialist society, they will never be confiscated. This will dispel their ideological concerns and stimulate their enthusiasm for tending forests. To do a good job in young forest tending, all regions should help farmers appropriately incorporate this work into their production activities. Shuangliao County in Liaoning Province, based on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, has incorporated young forest tending into the summer hoeing plan and assigned responsibility for different sections. Such practices are worth promoting.
　　In some areas of the South, farmers have the habit of intercropping agriculture and forestry. This practice can increase farmers' income on the one hand, and is also conducive to the tending of young forests on the other. This spring, farmers in Nanping Prefecture, Fujian Province, intercropped rice and sweet potatoes in the newly established Chinese fir forests. The entire prefecture plans to expand the grain planting area by 50,000 mu using forest land this year, which can increase grain production by 3 million jin. Farmers in Jianyang Prefecture have also planted buckwheat in the forest land. However, it should be noted that the climate and soil conditions in intercropping areas are different, and the intercropping methods and types of crops are also different. These have different effects on the growth of young forests. Therefore, in these areas, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance to farmers to avoid improper intercropping and damage to young trees.

　　巩固春季造林成果，加强幼林抚育工作
　　林宣
    五月初的统计，今春全国已造林八十一万五千七百三十四公顷。这是一个很大的成绩。为了巩固这个成绩，各地应该有重点地检查营造质量，很好地总结经验，同时努力做好对幼林的抚育保护工作。
    过去，有些地方，只注意造林，不注意幼林的抚育保护，结果造林的成活率、保存率都不高。发动农民辛辛苦苦栽植的树，不久就死掉了，这对国家对群众都是很大的浪费。
    抚育幼林的主要方法是除草和松土。这项工作在造林后的头三四年内特别重要。在一般地区第一年对幼林要抚育三次，第二年二次，第三年一次；在水分不足的地区，特别是杂草繁茂的地区，为了使幼树长得茁壮，还须增加抚育次数。同时，各地都必须设法防止人畜或山火破坏林木的现象。
    必须向广大农民进行抚育幼林的宣传教育工作。要向农民说明，林木是农民劳动的果实，农民种的树不会归公，就是到了社会主义社会，也绝不会被没收。这样就可以解除他们的思想顾虑，激发他们的抚育林木的热情。为了做好幼林抚育工作，各地应帮助农民把这项工作适当地安排到生产活动中去。辽宁省双辽县以互助合作组织为基础，把幼林抚育安排在夏锄计划之内，然后分段负责进行。这样的做法是值得提倡的。
    在南方某些地区，农民有农林混种的习惯。这种作法，一方面可以增加农民的收益，另一方面也有利于幼林的抚育。今春福建南平专区农民在营造的杉木林内间作稻和甘薯，全专区今年计划利用林地扩大粮食播种面积五万亩，可增产粮食三百万斤。建阳专区农民也在林地内种下了荞麦。但是，应该注意的是，混种地区的气候、土壤条件不同，混种方法和农作物种类也不同，这些对幼林生长都有不同的影响。因此在这些地区，要加强对农民的技术指导，避免混种不当和发生损伤幼树的现象。
