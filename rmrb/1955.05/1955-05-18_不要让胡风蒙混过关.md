　　Don't Let Hu Feng Get Away With It
　　Zhou Jichang
    I read Hu Feng's self-criticism and Shu Wu's revealed "materials" in comparison, and I couldn't suppress the anger in my heart. From the "materials," it becomes increasingly clear to people how Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique have been frantically opposing, hating, and loathing the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary literary and art ranks led by the Party for more than a decade, how arrogantly they have laid out their positions, exhausted their malicious schemes, and spared no effort to adopt all kinds of despicable strategies, stubbornly attacking the literary and art front led by the Party step by step, attempting to usurp the entire revolutionary literary and art position in order to realize their crazy ambitions. Hu Feng's bourgeois idealistic literary and art thought was finally nakedly exposed in his letter to Shu Wu, and his sectarian activities of the anti-Party clique based on this thought were even more blatantly displayed before us, making us unable to avoid being shocked.

    However, let us turn around and look at Hu Feng's so-called "My Self-Criticism." I think Hu Feng's article is not a problem of not being "self-critical" enough, nor is it a problem of "arguments" not being comprehensive enough, but the main tendency of this article is produced as a kind of "strategy." That is to say, although Hu Feng also tried to decorate some arguments in his article that were contrary to his own views or pretended to express his agreement with the critics on individual points, and although it seemed that he had put down some "knives" and "sticks" that he used to promote bourgeois idealistic literary and art thoughts, and pretended to surrender to the people, as long as we closely link his article with Shu Wu's "materials," we will see Hu Feng's trick.

    Hu Feng began by saying: "In this movement to criticize bourgeois ideology, I began to realize my serious mistakes. The root of my mistake is that I regarded the revolutionary nature and position of the petty bourgeoisie as the revolutionary nature and position of the working class, and confused the fundamental differences between them." (The emphasis is mine – Chang) From this statement that clarifies the purpose, we can easily see two points: First, he believes that the root of his mistake is due to regarding the revolutionary nature and position of the petty bourgeoisie as the revolutionary nature and position of the working class. Therefore, the essence of his mistake is not a reflection of the struggle between two hostile classes in the ideological field, but only an erroneous understanding of "revolutionary nature" caused by generally low political and theoretical levels; Second, through this statement, the conclusion is naturally drawn: Although he is standing on the position of the petty bourgeoisie, he still has his "revolutionary nature." That is, as he likes to sing, although he is not a Marxist, he still has some pursuit of Marxism. Therefore, saying that he is a bourgeois idealist, saying that he is an anti-Marxist, that is, an anti-Party ambitious person on the literary and art front, seems to be wronging him. And the criticism movement against Hu Feng's literary and art thought that is being carried out all over the country today seems to be a case fabricated by some sectarianists. How insidious this is! Rather than saying that Hu Feng is examining himself and repenting, it is better to say that he is fighting back and retreating in order to advance.

    We know that a large number of intellectuals with the revolutionary position of the petty bourgeoisie in our China are generally willing to transform their positions under the leadership of the Party, overcome some of their personal shortcomings, and thus serve the people faithfully. These people are good for the revolution. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Among the various forces of the united front in the literary and art circles, petty-bourgeois writers and artists are an important force in China. Their thoughts and works have many shortcomings, but they are relatively inclined to revolution and relatively close to the working people. Therefore, helping them overcome their shortcomings and winning them over to the front of serving the working people is a particularly important task." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume III, page 869) For more than ten years, the Party has done a lot of work in this regard. Therefore, whether before or after liberation, the broad masses of intellectuals from petty-bourgeois backgrounds have made certain contributions to the Party's revolutionary cause after accepting the Party's leadership. In a very long period in the future, that is, in the new historical period when the country is entering the transition to a socialist society, the Party will continue to educate and transform the petty bourgeoisie, and under the education and transformation of the Party, the petty bourgeoisie will also play a certain positive role in promoting the entire socialist construction cause, and they will advance together with the Party.

    However, Hu Feng also said that he is a revolutionary petty bourgeois, is this believable? From the "materials" revealed by Shu Wu, we can see very clearly: For more than ten years, he has consistently hated and loathed the Party in a frenzied manner, maliciously slandered the Party, and stubbornly resisted the Party's leadership in literary and art ideology and organization. In his eyes, the Party's leading force in the entire literary and art movement is nothing more than a "mechanistic ruling force," and he is precisely calling on every member of his small group to "spend a little more effort" to "shake" it from the root. At the same time, he described some comrades who are specifically responsible for the work of the Party in literature and art as "mandarins," "imperial envoys," "powerful and influential people," "officials," "masters," and "young masters," etc. Even after liberation in 1950, he still viciously described the Party newspaper's criticism of A Long as "punishment." Here, can we see half a shadow of revolution? Aren't these shocking words the ironclad evidence of Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people stance? Can this be said to be a trumped-up case? Can we say that his literary and art thought is an anti-Marxist, extremely frantic bourgeois idealistic thought and still be half wronging him?

    As the "People's Daily" editor's note said, Hu Feng's "self-criticism" is essentially his strategy of turning from offense to retreat. And this "strategy" is one that he has already used. If you don't believe it, look: "Now, it has become a situation of comprehensive attack, ... Judging from the situation, it will become more rampant," "I think it is better to be calm," "When I say change the method, I just mean to add some defense in strategy," "Almost have to pretend to be dead," "Have to 'endure'."

      Aren't these words the true feelings of why Hu Feng wants to write a "self-criticism" today? Because today, the criticism movement against Hu Feng's literary and art thought has been launched across the country. In Hu Feng's view, how could this not be "a situation of comprehensive attack"? Under this new situation, Hu Feng, unwilling to fail, is bound to "pretend to be dead." And his so-called "self-criticism" this time is precisely the concrete manifestation of his "pretending to be dead." However, people must not forget: Hu Feng's "self-criticism" of "pretending to be dead" is precisely his "strategy" of being "calm" and "changing methods," the purpose of which is to "add some defense." In order to muddle through the crisis and then accumulate strength, to launch another vicious attack on the Party and the literary and art movement led by the Party. Therefore, in his "self-criticism," he could not help but scold himself a few words about the points that others criticized him, but he never mentioned the facts of his anti-Party and anti-people activities, and tried his best to pretend to be a person with "the revolutionary nature and position of the petty bourgeoisie" who still had some "pursuit" of the Party and Marxism. In this way, he thought that the masses would forgive him, and he could skillfully enter the internal from the external of this movement, and then disintegrate from the internal of the movement, in order to finally shake the foundation of revolutionary literature and art from the root. Isn't this the truth of the "self-criticism"?

    Hu Feng's approach is actually an unreserved inheritance of the so-called "two-faced" strategy repeatedly used by the magicians in the anti-Party groups of the bourgeoisie in history, that is, using "self-criticism" to openly deceive and confuse the masses to achieve his sinister purpose.

    The history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union clearly tells us that after the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) held in December 1927 resolved to expel the anti-Party elements Trotsky, Zinoviev, and all members of the "Democratic Centralism" group in the Trotsky-Zinoviev alliance from the Party, these anti-Party elements used this two-faced trick. They also pretended to admit their mistakes to the Party, feigned to accept the investigation of the four conditions put forward by the Party, and also used newspapers to make public self-criticisms. However, the ultimate purpose of their hypocrisy was to deliberately trample on the erroneous political views that they had repeatedly insisted on in front of the Party and the masses, and only sought to preserve their position, so that it was possible to accumulate strength, wait for the opportunity, and further carry out anti-Party criminal activities internally. Their true ugly face of being unrepentant was initially tightly covered by the shirt of feigned self-criticism. However, what is fake is fake, and pretense cannot last. Their two-faced approach was quickly seen through by the then All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), so the Party promptly crushed their conspiracy.

    Here, I am not regarding Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique as a whole as a counter-revolutionary faction that has infiltrated the Party, but I am saying that Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique have already infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, and his two-faced approach of feigned self-criticism is essentially a replica of the two-faced approach of the Trotsky-Zinoviev anti-Party elements at that time, and will never deceive people.

    The only way out for Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique at present has been clearly pointed out in the editor's note of the "People's Daily" on May 13: "Hu Feng should do the work of removing the mask, not the deceptive self-criticism. Removing the mask, revealing the truth, and helping the Party to thoroughly clarify the entire situation of Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique, and from then on being a real person, is the only way out for Hu Feng and everyone in the Hu Feng faction." If he still wants to replay the two-faced "self-criticism" trick, then he will only isolate himself from the people.

    At the same time, I would also like to remind all members of the Hu Feng faction, such as A Long, etc., you have been fanatically following Hu Feng, using Hu Feng's banner, and carrying out anti-Party and anti-people work on the literary and art front; whether before or after liberation, how many Party writers and progressive literary and art workers who were ideologically inclined to the revolution, who had faithfully devoted their efforts to the Party, have suffered your vicious slanders, smears, and ridicule; how many revolutionary realist works that basically conform to the Party's literary and art policy and have a strong political role have been ruthlessly belittled in your hands, and you have deliberately weakened the political influence of revolutionary literature and art; what is your intention?

    Today, all members of Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique should be sober. Hu Feng should quickly remove the disguise, and all members of the Hu Feng faction should hand over the specific confidential documents of the instructions that Hu Feng once made on matters of principle in a timely manner to help the Party thoroughly clarify the problem, which is the only way out.

    However, before Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique have truly torn off the mask, we must be very vigilant. Comrades, we must never let Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique get away with it!

　　不要让胡风蒙混过关
　　周姬昌
    我把胡风的检讨和舒芜揭露的“材料”，对照地看了一下，我抑制不住内心的愤怒。从“材料”中，使人们愈来愈清楚地看到：十几年来胡风及其反党集团是怎样疯狂地敌对、仇视与痛恨着中国共产党和党所领导着的革命的文艺队伍，是怎样气焰嚣张地摆开阵势，用尽恶毒的心机，不惜采取十分鄙劣的各种各样的战略，步步为营地向党所领导的文艺战线顽强地进攻，企图篡夺整个革命的文艺阵地，用以实现其疯狂的野心。胡风的资产阶级唯心主义文艺思想在他写给舒芜的信中总算是赤裸裸地暴露得丝毫无遗了，而他的以这种思想为基础的反党集团的宗派活动更是十分露骨地展示在我们的面前，使我们不得不触目惊心。
    但是，我们回过头来再看看胡风的所谓“我的自我批判”吧。我认为胡风的这篇文章，并不是
  “检讨”得不深刻的问题，也不是什么“论点”谈得不全面的问题，而是这篇文章的主要倾向却是作为一种“策略”而产生的。就是说，胡风虽然也在他的文章中尽量装璜着一些和自己的立论相背离或者假惺惺地表示了在个别论点上他同意批评者的说法，虽然也好像他是放下了他的作为宣扬资产阶级唯心主义文艺思想用的一些“刀子”和“棍子”，而装出向人民投降的样子，但是，只要我们把他这篇文章和舒芜的“材料”紧紧联系起来看，我们就会看出胡风的鬼把戏。
    胡风劈头就说：“在这次批判资产阶级思想运动中，我开始认识到我的严重错误。我的错误底根源是，把小资产阶级的革命性和立场当作了工人阶级的革命性和立场，混淆了它们中间的原则的区别。”（重点是我加的——昌）从这开宗明义的一段说法中，我们不难看出两点：第一、他认为他的错误根源是由于把小资产阶级的革命性和立场当作是工人阶级的革命性和立场来看待。因此，他的错误实质，就不是两个敌对阶级的斗争在思想领域中的反映，而是仅止于一般由于政治水平不高、理论水平太低而造成的对“革命性”的错误的理解而已；第二、通过这一说法，自然得出结论：他虽然是站在小资产阶级的立场上，但还有他的“革命性”。也就是像他所喜欢高唱的，虽然不是马克思主义者，但对马克思主义还是有所追求的。因此，说他是资产阶级唯心主义者，说他是反马克思主义也即反党的在文艺战线上的野心家，好像是冤枉了他似的。而今天在全国各地展开的对胡风文艺思想的批判运动，好像又是什么宗派主义者在把他罗织成案了。这是何等阴险！与其说胡风是在检讨悔改，不如说是在反戈一击，以退为进。
    我们知道，具有小资产阶级革命性立场的知识分子，在我们中国是为数不少的，他们一般地都是愿意在党的领导下，改造自己的立场，克服个人的某些缺点，从而忠实服务于人民，这些人是对革命有好处的。正如毛泽东同志所说：“在文艺界统一战线的各种力量里面，小资产阶级文艺家在中国是一个重要的力量。他们的思想和作品都有很多缺点，但是他们比较地倾向于革命，比较地接近于劳动人民。因此，帮助他们克服缺点，争取他们到为劳动人民服务的战线上来，是一个特别重要的任务。”（“毛泽东选集”第三卷八六九页）十多年来，党在这方面，是做了不少工作的。因此，无论在解放前或解放后，广大小资产阶级出身的知识分子，在接受党的领导后，对党的革命事业是作过一定的贡献的。在今后的一个很长的时期中，也即是在国家进入向社会主义社会过渡的新的历史时期中，党还要继续不断地教育和改造小资产阶级，而小资产阶级在党的教育和改造下，也就对推动整个社会主义建设事业中起着一定的积极的作用，他们是会跟着党一同前进的。
    但是，胡风也说自己是革命的小资产阶级，这是能令人相信的吗？从舒芜揭露的“材料”中，我们看得很明白：十多年来，他却是一贯地丧心病狂地痛恨和仇视着党，并恶意中伤着党，顽强地抵制着党在文艺思想上和组织上的领导的。在他眼中，党在整个文艺运动中的领导力量，那不过是“机械论的统治势力”，而他正是要号召他的小集团的每一成员
  “多花一点力气”把它从根本上“动摇”的。同时，他又把党在文艺方面负责具体工作的某些同志说成是
  “马褂”、“钦差”、“权贵”、“官们”、“老爷们”以及什么“公子们”等等。直至解放后的一九五○年，还恶狠狠地把党报对阿垅的批评说成是
  “讨伐”。在这里，我们能看得出半点革命的影子来吗？这些触目惊心的字眼，不正是胡风反党反人民的铁证吗？这能说是罗织成案吗？我们说他的文艺思想是反马克思主义的极端疯狂的资产阶级唯心主义思想还有半点冤枉之处吗？
    正如“人民日报”按语所说，胡风的“检讨”，实质上是他从进攻转为退却的策略。而这种“策略”又是他早已施展过了的。不信你看：“现在，已经成了全面攻来之势，……看情形，还要愈加猖獗下去”，“我想，还是要沉着一点的好。我说变换方法，只是说的要在战略上加些防卫而已”，“几乎非装死不可”，“只得‘忍受’”。
      这些话难道不也就是胡风今天之所以要写“检讨”的真情流露吗？因为今天全国各地展开了对胡风文艺思想的批判运动。这在胡风看来，怎么不是
  “成了全面攻来之势”呢？在这新的形势之下，胡风既不甘心失败，就势必“非装死不可”。而他这次的所谓“检讨”，正是他“装死”的具体表现。但是，人们切切不能忘记：胡风的这种“装死”的
  “检讨”，却正是他的“战略”上的“沉着一点”的“变换方法”，其目的即在于“加些防卫而已”。以便蒙混过关以后，再度积蓄力量，对党及党所领导的文艺运动作再一次的恶毒攻击。因此，他在
  “检讨”中，也就不能不一面不关痛痒地就别人批判他的几个论点把自己骂了几句；一面却绝口不提他的反党反人民的活动事实，并尽量把自己装扮成一个具有“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”的对党和马克思主义还是有所“追求”的人。这样，他以为群众就会原谅他，他就可从这次运动的外部巧妙地打入内部，以后再从运动的内部进行瓦解，以期最后还是要从根动摇革命文艺的基础。“检讨”的真相不就是这样吗？
    胡风的这种做法，其实是不折不扣地承袭了历史上那些资产阶级反党集团中的魔术师们所一再沿用过的所谓“两面派”的战略，即利用“检讨”来公开向群众进行欺骗蒙混，以达到他的阴谋目的。
    苏联共产党的历史明白地昭告我们：在一九二七年十二月召开的联共（布）第十五次代表大会决议要把反党分子托洛茨基、季诺维也夫及托季联盟中的所有“民主集中派”集团的成员开除出党以后，这些反党分子就施展过这种两面派的手腕。他们也曾伪装地向党承认过错误，假意地接受过党所提出的四个条件的考察，并也曾利用报纸作过公开的检讨。然而，他们这种做作的最终目的，却在于故意在党和群众面前无耻地践踏着曾经为自己所一再坚持过的错误的政治观点，而只求保全自己的一席地位，以便有可能积蓄力量，等候时机，进一步在内部开展反党的罪恶活动。他们的这种死不醒悟的真正丑恶的面目，在最初就是被那种假意检讨的衣衫紧紧地掩盖着的。但是，假的就是假的，伪装是不能持久的。他们的这种两面派的手法，很快就被当时的联共（布）党看穿了，于是，党就及时粉碎了他们的阴谋。
    在这里，我不是把胡风及其反党集团整个看成是混入党内的反革命派别，而是说，胡风及其反党集团是已经混入了革命队伍中来，他的假意检讨的两面派的做法，实质上却正是托季反党分子当时两面派做法的翻版，是永远欺骗不了人的。
    胡风及其反党集团当前的唯一出路，五月十三日的“人民日报”的编者按语中已经明确指出：“胡风应当做剥去假面的工作，而不是骗人的检讨。剥去假面，揭露真相，帮助党彻底弄清胡风及其反党集团的全部情况，从此做个真正的人，是胡风及胡风派每一个人的唯一出路。”如果还想重演两面派的
  “检讨”把戏的话，那他只有自绝于人民了。
    同时，我还要提醒胡风派的所有成员，像阿垅等等，你们狂热地追随胡风，打着胡风的旗号，在文艺战线上进行着反党反人民的工作；无论在解放前或解放后，多少曾经为党忠心耿耿地付出了自己心血的党的作家和思想上倾向于革命的进步文艺家，遭致你们的恶毒的诽谤、诬蔑与嘲骂；多少基本上符合于党的文艺方针的具有强烈的政治作用的革命的现实主义的作品，在你们手中被无情地贬低，你们故意削弱革命文艺的政治影响；你们的用心究竟何在？
    今天，胡风及其反党集团的所有成员应该清醒了。胡风应该迅速剥去伪装，而胡风派的所有成员更应该及时地把胡风所曾作过原则问题的指示的具体密件交出来，帮助党全盘地弄清问题，这才是唯
  一的出路。
    不过，当胡风及其反党集团还没有真正撕毁假面以前，我们是必须万分提高警惕的。同志们，我们决不可让胡风及其反党集团蒙混过关！
