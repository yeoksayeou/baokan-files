Xinhua News Agency, London, May 22nd, TASS dispatch: "The Daily Worker" published a statement by the General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Pollitt, on the 21st.

The newspaper pointed out that Pollitt had originally intended to broadcast this statement on the radio, but the British Broadcasting Corporation refused to give Communist Party candidates the opportunity to make radio speeches.

Pollitt severely condemned the British government's foreign policy. Referring to the German question, Pollitt pointed out that as long as Germany remains divided, and as long as West Germany, controlled by supporters of Hitler, is being armed, there will be no lasting peace in Europe.

Pollitt continued that lasting peace is also impossible if preparations for atomic war do not stop.

Eliminating the division of Germany on the basis of free elections and ensuring that a unified Germany does not participate in any military blocs is the only policy that can lead to peace.

Pollitt then explained the basic points of the British Communist Party's election manifesto regarding the party's foreign and domestic policies.

British Conservative and Labour Parties' Election Campaigns Are Intense
British Voters Are Not Interested in Their Proposals

Xinhua News Agency, May 18th, London dispatch: The date of the British general election (May 26th) is now less than ten days away. With the approach of the election, the two major British parties—the Conservative Party and the Labour Party—are conducting intense election campaigns. However, the British people have shown indifference to these campaigns.

According to Reuters, attendance at most election rallies across Britain has been very low, with some rallies having fewer than a dozen people, and some even being unable to open due to insufficient numbers. British political figures believe that this election campaign is "the most dull one in their memory."

The broad masses of the British people are not interested in the election campaign because neither the Conservative Party nor the Labour Party has raised issues of concern to the broad masses. Reuters said that the Conservative Party and the Labour Party have "reached a consensus on many foreign policy issues," so the "only 'fresh' subject" in the election campaign is "accusations and counter-accusations about rising living costs." The Labour Party said that the ruling Conservative Party has failed to stop the rise in living costs; the Conservative Party retorted that living costs rose even more during the Labour Party's rule.

Reuters said that the voters' "obvious lack of interest" has caused concern among Conservative and Labour Party organizers, "who fear that their thousands of supporters may not vote."

　　英共总书记波立特斥责英政府的外交政策
    新华社二十二日讯　塔斯社伦敦讯：“工人日报”二十一日刊载了英国共产党总书记波立特的声明。
    报纸指出，波立特本来打算在电台广播这一声明，但是英国广播公司拒绝给共产党候选人发表广播演说的机会。
    波立特严厉斥责英国政府的外交政策。波立特在谈到德国问题时指出，只要德国还处于分裂状态，只要支持希特勒的人所控制的西德在武装起来，欧洲就不会有持久的和平。
    波立特接着说，原子战争的准备不停止，持久和平也是不可能的。
    在自由选举的基础上消除德国的分裂局面和保证使统一的德国不参加任何军事集团的政策，这就是唯一能导致和平的政策。
    波立特接着说明了英国共产党竞选宣言中提出的党的对外和对内政策的基本要点。英保守党和工党竞选活动很紧张
  英国选民对他们的主张不感兴趣
    新华社十八日讯　伦敦消息：目前离英国大选的日期（五月二十六日）已经不到十天了。随着大选的临近，英国两大政党——保守党和工党都在进行紧张的竞选活动。但是，英国人民却对这些竞选活动表示冷淡。
    据路透社报道，在英国全国大多数竞选集会上，到会人数都非常少，有的集会还不满一打人，有的甚至因为人数过少而开不成会。英国的政界人士认为这次竞选运动是“他们记忆所及的最沉闷的一次”。
    英国广大人民对竞选运动不感兴趣，是因为无论是保守党或者是工党都没有提出广大人民关心的问题来。路透社说，保守党同工党在“很多外交问题上取得了一致态度”，因此，在竞选运动中“唯一‘新鲜’的题材”就只剩下了“关于生活费用上涨的指责和反指责”。工党说，执政的保守党没有能够制止生活费用的上涨；保守党就反驳说，工党执政时期生活费用上涨得更厉害。
    路透社说，选民们对竞选的“显然缺乏兴趣”引起了保守党和工党的组织家的担心，“他们很怕他们的成千支持者可能不参加投票”。
