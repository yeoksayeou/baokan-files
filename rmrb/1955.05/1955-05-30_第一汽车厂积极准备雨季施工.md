First Automobile Works Actively Prepares for Rainy Season Construction

　　The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is actively preparing for rainy season construction. The Directly Subordinate Company, responsible for civil construction, has already formulated a comprehensive rainy season construction plan and on-site layout map. Drainage ditches have been cleared within the factory area, new roads and sidewalks have been built, and rainy season soil disposal areas have been established. Some work areas have been focusing on repairing roads and drainage systems since April. Currently, the forging workshop area has excavated more than 300 meters of drainage ditches and connected the sewers inside the workshop to the drainage system outside. More than 200 meters of temporary roads for the engineering building have been repaired, and a rainy season construction team has been established, mainly by the construction technology department. The body pressing workshop area has excavated more than 600 meters of drainage ditches around the workshop and warehouse, and paved 1,500 square meters of broken brick roads. To ensure smooth transportation within the factory area during rainy season construction, the company has established a road maintenance organization with more than 100 staff members.

　　The amount of rainy season construction work at the First Automobile Works site this year is large, accounting for 35.8 percent of the annual task. At the same time, this year's road, pipeline, and other projects are widely distributed, making construction more difficult. Timely preparation for rainy season construction is of great importance for the completion of the annual task. (Zhu Zhengkang)

　　第一汽车厂积极准备雨季施工
    第一汽车制造厂正积极地进行雨季施工准备工作。负责土木建筑施工的直属公司，已经作出全面的雨季施工措施方案和现场规划图。厂区内已经疏通了排水沟，新修了马路便道，并设立了雨季弃土区。有的工区从四月份就注意进行整修道路和排水系统的工作。现在锻工场工区已经挖排水沟三百多公尺，并已把场房内的下水道和场外的排水系统接通。工程大楼临时道路已经整修好二百多公尺，同时以施工技术部门为主设立了雨季施工小组。车身压制工区已经把场房和仓库外围的排水沟挖出六百多公尺，铺了碎砖道路一千五百平方公尺。为了保证雨季施工中厂区运输畅通，公司专门设立了有一百多名工作人员参加的道路养护组织。
    第一汽车厂工地今年的雨季施工工作量很大，占全年任务的百分之三十五点八。同时，今年施工的道路、管道等工程分布面积广，施工更加困难。及时作好雨季施工准备工作，对于全年任务的完成有重大作用。　（祝正康）
