Is the statement "Everyone has individualism" correct?
    Shì Xīn

    Among some Communist Party members, there is a popular argument: "Everyone has individualism." "Who doesn't have a little individualism!" These people exaggerate the fact that some comrades within the Party have varying degrees of individualistic ideological remnants due to their origins and environment, and portray it as if individualism is inevitable for every Communist Party member. This is, of course, an extremely erroneous statement. But more seriously, they derive the following conclusion from this: it doesn't matter if a Communist Party member has "a little" individualism.

    With this kind of "theory," these Communist Party members feel at ease with their own individualism, letting it be without vigilance or effort to overcome it. If someone criticizes them, they will use it as a shield: "Who doesn't have a little individualism!"

    With this kind of "theory," these Communist Party members also take a forgiving attitude towards the individualism of other comrades, even expressing sympathy because they are in the "same boat."

    Some Party organizations even "peacefully coexist" with individualism within the Party under the influence of this "theory." For example, at a recent grassroots cadre meeting held by the Party Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, it was revealed that some cadres of grassroots organizations believed that "everyone has individualism," and therefore relaxed the struggle against bourgeois individualism of some Party member cadres in the organization.

    It can be seen that this "everyone has individualism" argument is a corrosive, which plays a negative role in canceling ideological remolding and weakening ideological struggle, and must be refuted.

    It should be recognized that individualism is absolutely incompatible with the noble qualities of a Communist Party member. We often say that a Communist Party member is not an ordinary person, but a person with special characteristics. This is because a Communist Party member can, under any circumstances, make personal interests absolutely and unconditionally subordinate to the interests of the Party; a Communist Party member will always consider the overall interests of the Party at any time and on any issue, will put the interests of the Party first, and put personal problems and personal interests in a subordinate position; when the interests of the Party and personal interests conflict, they can resolutely subordinate themselves to the interests of the Party and sacrifice personal interests. Communist Party members regard any personal purpose and plan that deviates from the interests of the Party as illegal and shameful. Only in this way can Communist Party members contribute everything, including their lives, to the cause of the Party and the cause of the people. People with individualistic ideas, on the other hand, often put personal interests first and the interests of the Party behind, they either worry about gains and losses, and care about personal reputation, status, and material enjoyment; or they seek personal gain under the guise of public service, using the work of the Party to achieve certain personal goals; or they use work as an excuse to carry out personal revenge. How can individualism coexist with communism? How can it be considered irrelevant for a Communist Party member to have individualism?

    Perhaps some people think that individualistic careerists, that is, "big individualism," should be opposed; as for "a little" individualism, that is, "small individualism," it is harmless. However, individualism and communism are always mutually exclusive. "Big individualism" certainly has serious harm to the Party and the revolution, and "small individualism" is no less harmful to the Party and the revolution. What's more, there is no insurmountable wall between "small individualism" and "big individualism." Didn't some despicable bourgeois individualists who have been exposed and purged by the Party start with such serious individualism? No. They also developed from "small individualism" to "big individualism." As the saying goes: "He who steals a needle when young, will steal gold when old." If individualism is not overcome in its infancy, it will inevitably grow and spread when it encounters a suitable climate and soil, even to the point where it cannot be contained. This is like a malignant tumor, if not treated when it first appears, it will develop and kill people.

    Then, can individualism be overcome and eliminated? Yes, for many of us Communist Party members who come from non-proletarian backgrounds and live in the present class society, it is a long-term and arduous process to overcome and even completely eliminate individualism. This shows the extreme importance of Communist Party members actively carrying out ideological remolding. But it is by no means impossible to overcome and eliminate individualism. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists": "As long as we are determined to work hard and diligently to study, cultivate, and exercise, do not break away from the revolutionary movement of the broad masses, and master the methods of Marxism-Leninism, then we are fully capable of raising our qualities to the height of the qualities of a Leninist politician." In fact, both in the past and now, there are many outstanding Party members in our Party who are infinitely loyal to the Party, the class, and the people, and who have completely dissolved their personal interests into the interests of the Party. They are role models for everyone to learn from. The view that any Communist Party member is inevitably individualistic is the result of being influenced by the extremely selfish and self-interested outlook on life of the bourgeoisie, "Heaven and earth will destroy those who do not act for themselves," which has nothing in common with the communist outlook on life that a Communist Party member should have.

    Individualism must be resolutely opposed. The "theory" that "everyone has individualism" must also be resolutely opposed. Only by resolutely opposing this absurd and harmful argument can we better overcome and eliminate individualism.

### “个人主义，人皆有之”的说法对吗

　　“个人主义，人皆有之”的说法对吗
　　湜辛
    在某些共产党员中间，流行着这样一种论调：“个人主义，人皆有之。”“谁没有一点个人主义呢！”这些人把党内一部分同志由于出身和环境的影响存在不同程度的个人主义思想残余的事实加以夸大，说成个人主义对于每个共产党员来说都是免不了的。这当然是极其错误的说法。但是更严重的是他们因此引伸出这样一个结论：共产党员有“一点”个人主义，是无关紧要的。
    有了这种“理论”，这些共产党员就对自己的个人主义心安理得，听之任之，而不加警惕，不去努力克服。要是有人对他提出批评，他还会拿出挡箭牌来：“谁没有一点个人主义呢！”
    有了这种“理论”，这些共产党员也就对其他同志的个人主义采取原谅的态度，甚至因为“同病相怜”而表示同情。
    有的党组织竟也在这种“理论”的影响下，同党内的个人主义“和平共处”。例如，在中共上海市人民委员会机关委员会不久以前举行的一次基层干部会议上，就揭露了有的基层组织的干部认为
  “个人主义，人皆有之”，因而放松了对机关中某些党员干部的资产阶级个人主义的斗争。
    由此可见，这种“个人主义，人皆有之”的论调是一种腐蚀剂，它起着取消思想改造、削弱思想斗争的消极作用，必须加以驳斥。
    应当认识，个人主义是同共产党员的高贵品质绝不相容的。我们常说共产党员不是普通的人，而是具有特种性格的人。这就因为一个共产党员不论在什么情况下都能使个人的利益绝对地、无条件地服从党的利益；一个共产党员在任何时候、任何问题上都会估计到党的整个利益，都会把党的利益摆在前面，把个人的问题、个人利益摆在服从的地位；在党的利益和个人利益发生矛盾时，可以坚决地服从党的利益，牺牲个人利益。共产党员把任何离开党的利益的个人目的和打算，都看做是非法的、可耻的。只有这样，共产党员才能为了党的事业，为了人民的事业而贡献出自己的一切，包括自己的生命。而有个人主义思想的人，常常是把个人利益摆在前面，而把党的利益摆在后面，他们或者患得患失，计较个人的名誉、地位和物质享受；或者假公营私，借着党的工作达到私人的某种目的；或者借口为了工作，进行私人报复。个人主义怎能和共产主义并存呢？共产党员有个人主义怎么能够认为无关紧要呢？
    或许有人认为个人主义野心家，也就是“大个人主义”是应当反对的；至于“一点”个人主义，也就是“小个人主义”是无伤大体的。但是，个人主义和共产主义总是互相排斥的。“大个人主义”固然对党、对革命有严重的危害，“小个人主义”对党、对革命的危害同样是不小的。何况，在“小个人主义”同“大个人主义”之间并没有一堵什么不可逾越的墙。难道某些已经被党揭露和清除出去的卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义分子，他们身上的个人主义一开始就那么严重？不是的。他也是从“小个人主义”发展到“大个人主义”的。俗话说：“小时偷针，大时偷金”。对于个人主义如果不在萌芽状态就加以克服，它遇到适宜的气候和土壤，就必然会滋长和蔓延起来，甚至达到不可收拾的地步。这也好像一个毒瘤在初出现时不加治疗，发展下去就会致人于死地一样。
    那末，个人主义是否能够克服和肃清呢？不错，对于我们许多出身于非无产阶级而又生活在有阶级的现社会中的共产党员来说，要克服以至完全肃清个人主义，这是一个长期的艰苦的努力过程。这说明了共产党员积极进行思想改造的极端重要。但要克服和肃清个人主义决不是不可能办到的。正如刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”中所指出的：“只要我们决心努力并刻苦地去学习、修养和锻炼，不脱离广大群众的革命运动，掌握了马列主义的方法，那我们完全可能把自己的品质提高到列宁式的政治家的品质之高度。”事实上，不论过去和现在，在我们党内都有许许多多对党、对阶级、对人民无限忠诚，而使自己个人的利益完全溶化于党的利益的优秀党员。他们是大家学习的榜样。那种认为任何共产党员都免不了有个人主义的看法，正是受了资产阶级“人不为己，天诛地灭”的极端自私自利的人生观影响的结果，这同一个共产党员应有的共产主义人生观是没有丝毫共同之处的。
    个人主义必须坚决反对。“个人主义，人皆有之”的“理论”也必须坚决反对。只有坚决地反对了这种荒谬和有害的论调，才能更好地克服和肃清个人主义。
