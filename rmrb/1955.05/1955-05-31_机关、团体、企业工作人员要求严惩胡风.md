Personnel from Institutions, Organizations, and Enterprises Demand Severe Punishment for Hu Feng

    The 450 staff members of the Beijing Third Hospital wrote: The two batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary group in the recent newspapers have aroused immense anger among our medical workers. We have seen clearly Hu Feng's ugly face. We completely agree with the masses' condemnation of the Hu Feng group. The nature of the Hu Feng issue is not merely a matter of reactionary subjective idealism but a major struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. The crimes of the Hu Feng group are intolerable and unforgivable. We demand the revocation of his qualification as a representative to the National People's Congress and a thorough investigation of his group's counter-revolutionary crimes.
    Hu Baihua from the Yuchang Fish Farm in Wanxian Special District, Sichuan Province, wrote: I am a fisheries work cadre. For more than a decade, Hu Feng has opposed the Party's literary and artistic policies. He insidiously and viciously attacked the Party and the revolutionary literary and art circles, attempting to replace the Party's correct theory with his bourgeois idealist theory. However, counterfeit goods cannot deceive readers for long. We thank the Party for its wise and decisive action in exposing the crimes of Hu Feng and his group, educating us and making us clearly aware of the dangers of disguised enemies. We are very angry at such a representative of the reactionary class who wears the cloak of Marxism. We will not allow Hu Feng to continue to be a representative to the National People's Congress and he should be purged.
    Chen Weiman and other eight members of the production internship group of the Planning Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region wrote: The facts are now very clear: Hu Feng, as the head of the anti-Party group, is an enemy of the Party and the people; Hu Feng has completely lost the qualification for all the positions he holds in the people's political life. Therefore, we firmly demand the revocation of Hu Feng's qualification as a representative to the National People's Congress and the removal of Hu Feng from the revolutionary ranks!
    Liu Jianguo from the Cangxian Local Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province wrote: I am an office cadre. After reading the materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party group published in the "People's Daily," my angry mood could not be suppressed. It turns out that the Hu Feng group is a group of treacherous, cunning, insidious, vicious, and hideous counter-revolutionaries!
    The Party has led the Chinese people in fighting for more than thirty years, defeating fierce enemies at home and abroad, establishing a people's democratic dictatorship, and the people have become the masters of the country and have begun to gradually transition to a happy socialist society. However, the Hu Feng group, this group of vermin of mankind, hidden in the revolutionary ranks, is carrying out counter-revolutionary crimes, attempting to overthrow the people's revolutionary regime to complete his "greater future" "cause," which is intolerable!
    Hu Feng is an enemy of the Chinese people, a loyal son of Chiang Kai-shek. We must thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group!
    Guo Jin and Cheng Wanmin and other five people from Zhangjiakou Special District, Hebei Province, wrote: After reading the letters of the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng using bandit and secret agent-style "black language," it really made us unable to suppress our emotional impulses and we became extremely angry. Although we are not Party member writers or progressive writers, we feel that Hu Feng is slandering and cursing ourselves because he is completely opposed to our Party and the people and is irreconcilable with them. Therefore, we fully support the resolution of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Writers Association to expel Hu Feng from membership and remove him from all positions in literary and art circles, and at the same time suggest revoking his qualification as a representative to the National People's Congress.
    This fellow Hu Feng is more vicious than a secret agent with a silent pistol. We used to think he was some kind of "literary man" "writer" with some ideological problems that could be reformed. Now we see clearly that he does not even have the air of a literary man or a writer. He is completely a wolf in sheep's clothing. He mocks and teases the people's expectations, and he wants to "seek rebirth in suffering," "for a greater future," determined to fight against the Party and the people, without any remorse. This shows that he will not accept the Party and the people's loyal advice. We must thoroughly settle accounts with Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes and expel him from the revolutionary camp.
    Yang Ruiqing, a staff member of the Yangzhou Branch of the China Coal Mine Construction Equipment Company, wrote: After reading the materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party group in the "People's Daily," I couldn't help but think of the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek, who, after the surrender of the Japanese invaders in 1945, negotiated with the Communist Party on the one hand and actively prepared to attack the liberated areas and launch a civil war on the other. Before writing his so-called "My Self-Criticism," Hu Feng wrote a large number of letters to members of his anti-Party group, arranging a retreat, telling his cronies to "seek rebirth in suffering." Isn't this method exactly the same as Chiang Kai-shek's? In order to eliminate harm for the people, I, as a citizen, demand that the government severely punish the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng!
    Wang Dezhong, Mao Qibin, and other thirty-two people from the head office of the People's Insurance Company of China, wrote: We are cadres of the national financial authorities. After seeing the materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party group in the "People's Daily," we held a symposium on May 25, and everyone felt extremely angry.
    From the materials revealed in the newspaper, it can be seen that Hu Feng is not a person who only has ideological problems, nor is he simply an individualistic careerist in literary and art circles, but a vicious and insidious counter-revolutionary who has been hiding in the revolutionary ranks for a long time, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, hiding a knife in his smile, and being honey-tongued and dagger-hearted.
    Hu Feng's long-term organized, programmed, and planned counter-revolutionary activities are absolutely intolerable, and we must thoroughly expose and smash them.
    The Hu Feng incident reflects the complexity of the class struggle in our country during the transition period. The hidden enemies are extremely cunning, and they try their best to undermine our great revolutionary cause. Therefore, we must be a hundred times more vigilant, unite as one, strengthen our work, and protect our victory like we protect our eyes.
    Zhan Ren and Tan Hongzhen from the Shenyang Federation of Industry and Commerce wrote: The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, like other open or hidden counter-revolutionaries, their hope and purpose is to overthrow our people's democratic dictatorship and undermine our socialist construction. We must learn a lesson from the fact that the conspiracy of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was exposed, and we must be a hundred times more vigilant in the future, remove those counter-revolutionaries who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose the revolution, and defend our motherland and our socialist construction.
    Liu Shaoping, Zhuang Zhizheng and other ten people from the Policy Research Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions wrote: We warmly support the resolution of the joint meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Writers Association on expelling Hu Feng from the Writers Association and removing him from all positions, and suggest that the People's Procuratorate deal with Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes.
    For more than twenty years, Hu Feng has been disguising himself as a revolutionary literary and art worker, but in the revolutionary ranks, he has been engaged in the most ugly and despicable conspiracies. He so frantically hated the Party and the cause of the Party, opposed the Party's literary and art policies; after liberation, he also used various insidious means to try to destroy the Party's leadership over the literary and art cause.
    The letters from Hu Feng to his cronies prove that he is a deadly enemy of the working class's revolutionary cause. His purpose is to overthrow the regime led by the Party and the working class and restore counter-revolutionary rule. We must be doubly vigilant and give the deadly enemy of the working class a merciless blow.
    Zhu Yuyi from the Jiande Branch of the China Food Company wrote: The anti-Party and anti-people group of Hu Feng has been completely confirmed in the materials revealed by Shu Wu. I am a young man of New China, an ordinary citizen of the People's Republic of China. I want to accuse and express my opinions in the Party's newspaper. I firmly demand the revocation of Hu Feng's qualification as a representative to the National People's Congress.
    Hu Feng, this bloodless murderer, this wolf in sheep's clothing, has consistently engaged in anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes for more than twenty years. Even after liberation, he still disguised himself as a revolutionary and mixed in the revolutionary ranks. He wanted to "contact people," "win people over," "engage in development work," and "greatly strengthen his strength" to confront our revolutionary cause. Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people crimes have reached the point of madness. If he and his group members are allowed to exist, develop, and expand, as the "People's Daily" editor's note on May 18 solemnly pointed out, it will cause serious damage to our revolutionary cause.
    Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people actions have political conspiracies, and this is not just a matter for literary and art circles. Hu Feng's mistakes are definitely not just ideological. Young people in all our positions have a responsibility to encircle and suppress Hu Feng and his group to completely annihilate them.
    I am a soldier on the commercial front. I resolutely respond to the Party's call, be a hundred times more vigilant, and not allow this group of disguised elements who claim to be revolutionaries to remain.
    Yuan Zhenhua from the Taiyuan People's Bank wrote: Hu Feng, this cunning counter-revolutionary, is hiding in our revolutionary camp, secretly carrying out counter-revolutionary activities, plotting to restore the reactionary regime. Just look at what Hu Feng said in his letter to his crony Zhang Zhongxiao: "Don't be painful, be calm. There are still many things we have to endure, and only in suffering can we seek rebirth. Everything is for the cause, for a greater future!" When I saw this, I couldn't help but grit my teeth, stomp my feet, slap my palms, and shout: What a "great future!" This guy's intention is very sinister! You are not honestly bowing your head to the people, but you still want to further carry out a frenzied attack on our revolutionary cause. Let me tell you: the old era is gone forever. Our eyes are sharp, and we will no longer be harmed or fooled by you. I demand that the government severely punish this counter-revolutionary.
    Lu Feng from the Jingxian Branch of the People's Bank of China wrote: I am a cadre working in rural areas. The facts revealed in the recent newspapers have made us see very clearly Hu Feng's ferocious face. He wears the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and carries out counter-revolutionary activities. Hu Feng not only engages in anti-Party and anti-people counter-revolutionary activities in thought, but also, in organization, gathers literary and artistic scum to viciously counterattack writers who have achieved success inside and outside the Party. He hates progressive writers as much as American imperialism hates the young New China. His hostility to the liberation of the Chinese people is just like the way American imperialism tries every possible means to train secret agents and use Chiang Kai-shek, the enemy of the Chinese people, to sabotage our country's construction. Hu Feng's advocacy of "subjective fighting spirit" is an attempt to lead people to stubborn reactionary fortresses. Why is Hu Feng so resolute? He may have an unspeakable background. Hu Feng's vicious methods are really infuriating.
    Warning to the likes of Hu Feng, any disguise is a stupid act of covering one's ears to steal a bell. I suggest that the relevant departments thoroughly investigate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.
    Yan Ping, a staff member of the Fifth District of Gaomi County, Shandong Province, wrote: After reading Shu Wu's exposure of Hu Feng's anti-Party materials published in the newspaper, I recognized that Hu Feng is a treacherous counter-revolutionary who has always been an enemy of the Party and the people. He is a quack doctor who coats bitter melon with sugar and uses the name of "tonic" to poison our young people. Therefore, I express my deep hatred for these crimes, and I demand that the government severely punish him.
    Here, I want to denounce Hu Feng: Hu Feng! Let me tell you, your hood has been torn off by us. Your ugly and hideous face is exposed. What kind of position and political face you have is now clearly revealed to the people. Pack up your deceptive tricks! Any further tricks can only be reactionary acts that are intensified. I warn you, honestly lower your head and confess your crimes to the people is your only way out. Don't pretend to examine yourself, or act like a monkey. Know that if you don't change this attitude, the people will not let you off easily.
    I am a young man, determined to participate in this struggle, and I want to mobilize all the young people in my district to open fire on you and fight against you. We will never give up until the final victory is won.
    All members of the general branch of the Youth League of the Cultural Department wrote: Now we send you the public letter unanimously approved by our general branch of 128 Youth League members, demanding severe punishment for the Hu Feng anti-Party group. We clearly realize that the problem of the Hu Feng group is no longer an ideological problem, but a serious political problem of the counter-revolutionary group undermining our revolutionary cause. We fully support the five resolutions made by the joint meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, and suggest continuing to thoroughly investigate the anti-Party and anti-people political background of the Hu Feng group and severely punish them according to national laws.
    All of us Youth League members promise to strengthen political study and improve political vigilance in future practical work and struggles, not allowing a single counter-revolutionary to easily undermine our revolutionary cause, and strive to ensure the smooth progress of the socialist construction cause!
    Wu Zhen from the East China Cultural Relics Work Team wrote: I am an archaeological worker. After reading the materials published in the "People's Daily" that exposed the counter-revolutionary criminal activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party group, I felt extremely indignant. Now we know that Hu Feng and his anti-Party group have long been not only our ideological enemies, but also our political enemies. In order to purify the revolutionary ranks, we must remove the resolutely anti-Party elements in the Hu Feng group from the revolutionary ranks as early as possible, and give them the punishment they deserve according to their reactionary crimes.
    Through this fact, I further realize that we must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, actively participate in the struggle to criticize bourgeois reactionary ideology, and resolutely get rid of the influence of bourgeois ideology on us. Only in this way can we avoid or reduce mistakes in every struggle for the socialist construction of the motherland; can we recognize the essence of things through various complex phenomena; and can we expose those enemies disguised in progress in time without being deceived by them.
    Xu Jiping from the Baotou Wired Broadcasting Station wrote: I am a broadcaster. In the past, I was not very familiar with Hu Feng. Since the nationwide criticism of the Hu Feng movement began, I only thought that there were some problems with the ideas and views in his works. After reading Hu Feng's so-called "My Self-Criticism" and the materials exposed by Shu Wu in the "People's Daily" on May 13, I was shocked! The Hu Feng issue turned out not to be an ideological issue for ordinary intellectuals, but a serious political issue.
    From the materials revealed, it can be seen that Hu Feng is no different from imperialist secret agents and counter-revolutionaries, even more insidious and vicious. Hu Feng's smile is his way of working, but killing is his purpose. He tried to strangle our revolutionary cause.
    Hu Feng pinned his hopes on the restoration of the counter-revolutionary regime and the downfall of the people's revolutionary regime. We resolutely demand the suppression of such counter-revolutionaries. I demand the immediate revocation of his qualification as a representative to the National People's Congress.
    I resolutely respond to the call of the Party newspaper, pay attention in my work to distinguishing those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose the revolution, and remove them from each of our fronts to defend the great victory we have already won and will win.
    Wang Zhixun from the Shanxi People's Broadcasting Station wrote: The revelation of the two batches of materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party group made us realize that the Hu Feng group is not a "writer" at all, but a group of wolves in human skin.
    I am a young man who was once poisoned by Hu Feng's reactionary theories. Before liberation, in the Kuomintang-ruled area, myself and some classmates were deceived by Hu Feng's various beautiful decorations. Because of being poisoned by his ideology, I refused several times when my classmates asked me to go to the liberated area. He guided young people to separate from the masses and stay away from the revolutionary struggle, so as to achieve his desire to sabotage the revolution and disintegrate the revolution. Is this accidental?
    In the past, I also thought that this was an ideological problem, not a political problem. We were too low in our vigilance against Hu Feng, and we were too loyal to this insidious guy. It turned out that this Hu Feng, who was full of "Marxism-Leninism" and "revolution," was precisely the counter-revolutionary who was drilling into the revolutionary ranks with "organizational principles," "struggle programs," and extreme hatred and opposition to the revolution, the Party.
    We can no longer be silent. We have been deceived enough by them. We must never let them use "cluster grenades" to attack the revolution again. We resolutely demand the revocation of all positions that Hu Feng has fraudulently obtained by using double-dealing methods, and arrest him and bring him to justice.
    Wang Zhen, Wei Zhiping, and Zhang Shuzhi from the Shandong Provincial Department of Justice wrote: We are staff members of the judicial organs. We warmly support the resolution of the joint meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on expelling Hu Feng, the head of the anti-Party and anti-people group, from the Writers Association, removing Hu Feng from the positions he holds, and suggesting revoking Hu Feng's qualification as a representative to the National People's Congress.
    For more than twenty years, Hu Feng has been wearing the cloak of Marxism, using the banner of literary and art theorist, spreading bourgeois idealist ideas everywhere, organizing anti-Party and anti-people groups, and looking for every opportunity to launch attacks on the Party and the people. His crimes are profound. Judging from the materials revealed, Hu Feng's cronies are still lurking in some of our departments. Therefore, we must be vigilant and resolutely carry out this struggle to the end.
    Zhang Bida from the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry wrote: The crimes of counter-revolutionary Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary activities make me very angry. Our great Party and people have always treated Hu Feng with utmost benevolence and righteousness, but the black-hearted counter-revolutionary Hu Feng not only despises the Party and the people's trust in him, making him elected as a representative to the National People's Congress, but on the contrary, he is frantically engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. This is unforgivable to anyone.
    Now the people of the whole country are building the great motherland with full confidence, and we must build a socialist society. No matter how rampant the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng group and all counter-revolutionaries are, and how hard they try to sabotage our great cause, they are bound to fail. We will never allow the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group to continue to undermine our cause. I demand that Hu Feng be removed from the revolutionary ranks first, and severely punished according to law!
    Zhao Tielun from the Anshan Black Metallurgical Design Institute wrote: Judging from the materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party group revealed in the newspaper, Hu Feng, this sinful conspirator, is very hostile to the Communist Party and the people. His group's activities are organized, planned, tactical, and strategic. From this, we cannot help but suspect whether the Hu Feng anti-Party group has the support of the backstage master. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate all the activities of this anti-Party and counter-revolutionary group.
    I am an engineering and technical worker. Like other people who are enthusiastic about the motherland's construction, I participate in the socialist construction of the motherland with selfless labor. Therefore, I cannot but feel great anger at the criminal activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party group. We must thoroughly smash this anti-Party group; the chief culprit Hu Feng should be severely punished according to law.
    Tong Ping from the Automotive Industry Administration wrote: After reading Hu Feng's so-called "My Self-Criticism" and the materials exposed by Shu Wu and the second batch of materials published in the Party newspaper on May 24, any reader with a little revolutionary sense of justice will be greatly shocked and incomparably angry! Hu Feng, this corrupt and rotten two-faced bad guy, has been completely exposed to the people. He can not only not be crowned with the lofty title of "engineer of human souls," but even the conditions for being a basic ordinary person cannot be found in him. Please look at his decayed and stinking words: he called the CPC Central Committee a "board of directors," and Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," a work of genius, was called "a 'totem' booklet," and Party member writers and progressive writers were regarded as "maggots," "philistines," "opportunists," "flies and mosquitoes," "robbers and swindlers"... All this shows that Hu Feng is extremely hostile to the Party, our great leader, and the people, and also shows that Hu Feng and the Hu Feng anti-Party group have been disguising themselves as progressives for more than twenty years, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and using various despicable means to carry out conspiracies and sabotage activities. The Hu Feng anti-Party group has been organized, planned, programmed, and disciplined for a long time. He spares no effort to instruct his lackeys to sneak into the Party, the army, government agencies, factories, mines, schools, and newspapers to steal Party documents, inquire about intelligence, and carry out sabotage in a planned way. What is the difference between this and the secret agents sent by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang? In order to thoroughly smash this "snake den," we must find out the political background of the Hu Feng group and settle accounts for their crimes.
    I fully support the unanimous call of the masses and fully support the resolution made by the joint expanded meeting of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association.
    We call for: Hu Feng's qualification as a representative to the National People's Congress must be revoked, and it is suggested that the procuratorial organs conduct a thorough investigation of the Hu Feng group.
    All members of the Hu Feng group should quickly confess their crimes to the people, and they should know that thorough confession is the only way out. If they are still obsessed, what awaits you will be a ruthless judgment.
    Lou Guansong from the Donghe District Committee of Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, wrote: I am a rural work cadre. Hu Feng is in the revolutionary ranks, eating the people's food, but doing counter-revolutionary things. Who can tolerate his crime! We must resolutely overthrow this kind of person who hangs a sheep's head and sells dog meat, and has a human face and a beast's heart. Hu Feng has "accumulated too much resentment" against our Party, constantly "charging" and attacking our Party, and using bloodless means, using "a whip wrapped in rubber to beat prisoners" to whip our Party and literary and art comrades. What is the difference between this and fascist agents! We must thoroughly settle accounts for the crimes of the Hu Feng anti-Party group.

### 机关、团体、企业工作人员要求严惩胡风

专栏：

    机关、团体、企业工作人员要求严惩胡风
    北京市第三医院职工四百五十人来信：最近报纸上揭发了胡风反党、反人民、反革命集团的两批材料，引起了我们医务工作者的无比愤怒。我们看清了胡风的丑恶面目。我们完全同意广大群众对胡风集团的声讨。胡风问题的性质，不单单是反动的主观唯心论的思想问题，而是革命同反革命的重大斗争。胡风集团的罪行是不能容忍和不可饶恕的。我们要求撤销他的全国人民代表大会代表的资格，要求彻底清查他的集团的反革命罪行。
    四川省万县专区鱼场胡白桦来信：我是一个水产工作干部。胡风十几年来一直反对党的文艺方针政策，他阴险狠毒地向党、向革命文艺界进攻，妄图用他的资产阶级的唯心主义的理论来代替党的正确理论。但是伪造的货色是不能长久欺骗读者的。我们感谢党的英明果断，把胡风及其集团的罪恶揭露出来，教育了我们，使我们清楚地认识了伪装的敌人的危害性。我们非常愤恨像胡风这样披着马克思主义外衣的反动阶级的代言人。我们不允许胡风继续再当全国人民代表大会的代表，应该把他清洗出去。
    内蒙古自治区计划委员会生产实习小组陈维满等八人来信：现在的事实已很清楚：作为反党集团首脑的胡风是党和人民的公敌；胡风已完全失去他在人民政治生活中所担任的一切职务的资格。因此，我们坚决要求撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格，把胡风从革命队伍中清洗出去！
    中共河北省沧县地方委员会刘建国来信：我是一个机关干部。当我看了“人民日报”发表的关于胡风反党集团的材料以后，我的愤怒的心情不可抑止了，原来胡风集团是一群奸诈、狡猾、阴险、毒辣、面目狰狞的反革命分子！
    党领导中国人民奋斗了三十多年，战胜了国内外凶恶的敌人，建立了人民民主专政的国家政权，人民成了国家的主人，并开始逐步向幸福的社会主义过渡，但是胡风集团，这一群人类的蟊贼，暗藏在革命队伍里，进行着反革命的罪恶活动，企图推翻人民的革命政权，以完成他的“更远大的未来”的“事业”，是可忍孰不可忍！
    胡风是中国人民的敌人，是蒋介石的忠臣肖子。我们一定要彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团！
    河北省张家口专区郭锦、程万民等五人来信：我们看了反革命分子胡风用土匪特务式的“黑话”的信件，真使我们不能抑制情绪的冲动，万分愤怒起来。我们虽不是党员作家或进步作家，但是觉得胡风正是污蔑和咒骂我们自己，因为他是完全同我们的党和人民敌对，势不两立的，因之我们完全拥护中国文联主席团和作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，开除胡风会籍并撤销他在文艺界的一切职务，同时建议撤销他的全国人民代表大会代表的资格。
    胡风这个家伙要比拿着无声手枪的特务更凶恶。我们过去还以为他是个什么“文人”“作家”，思想有点毛病，可以改造。现在我们看清楚了，他连一点文人、作家的气味也没有，他完全是披着羊皮的恶狼。他对人民的期待给以嘲笑和玩弄，他要“在忍受中求得重生，”“为了更远大的未来，”决心来同党和人民作对，毫无悔祸之心，这说明他是不会接受党和人民的忠言的。我们要彻底清算胡风的反革命罪行，从革命阵营中把他开除出去。
    中国煤业建筑器材公司扬州支公司工作人员杨瑞清来信：看了“人民日报”揭发的关于胡风反党集团的材料之后，我不禁联想起人民的公敌蒋贼在一九四五年日寇投降后，一面同共产党谈判，一面积极准备向解放区进攻，发动内战的事情来。胡风在写他那篇所谓“我的自我批判”之前，就向他的反党集团成员写了大批信件，布置退却，要他的党羽们“在忍受中求得重生”。这种手段不正是同蒋贼的那种手法如出一辙吗？为了给人民除害，我以公民的身份，要求政府从严惩办反革命分子胡风！
    中国人民保险公司总公司汪德锺、毛启邠等三十二人来信：我们是国家财政机关的干部。我们看到了“人民日报”揭发的关于胡风反党集团的材料后，在五月二十五日举行了一次座谈，大家感到无比的愤怒。
    从报纸所揭发的材料中可以看出：胡风不是一个仅仅思想有问题的人，也不单是一个文艺界的个人主义野心家，而是一个长期隐藏在革命队伍内部、披着马克思列宁主义外衣、笑里藏刀、口蜜腹剑的狠毒阴险的反革命分子。
    胡风长时期进行的有组织、有纲领、有计划的反革命活动，是绝对不能令人容忍的，我们一定要予以彻底地揭破和粉碎。
    胡风事件反映了我国过渡时期的阶级斗争的复杂性。暗藏的敌人是极其狡猾的，他们千方百计地破坏我们伟大的革命事业。因此，我们一定要百倍地提高警惕，团结一致，加强工作，像保护眼珠一样来保护我们的胜利。
    沈阳市工商业联合会湛仁、谭洪祯来信：胡风反革命集团，和其他公开的或暗藏的反革命分子一样，他们的希望和目的是要推翻我们人民民主专政政权，破坏我们的社会主义建设事业。我们从揭露胡风反革命集团的阴谋活动这一事实中必须吸取教训，今后一定要更加百倍地提高革命警惕性，把那些伪装拥护革命，而实际上反对革命的反革命分子清除出去，来保卫我们的祖国，保卫我们的社会主义建设。
    中华全国总工会政策研究室刘少屏、庄志峥等十人来信：我们热烈拥护中国文联主席团、作家协会主席团联席扩大会议关于开除胡风作家协会会籍、撤销其一切职务，并建议人民检察院处理胡风反革命罪行的决议。
    二十多年来，胡风一直把自己装扮成革命文艺工作者的样子，但在革命队伍中，却从事最丑恶、最卑鄙的阴谋活动。他那样疯狂地仇视党和党的事业，反对党的文艺政策；解放后，还用各种阴险的手段，企图摧毁党对文学艺术事业的领导。
    从胡风写给他的党羽的信中，证明了他是工人阶级革命事业的死敌。他的目的就是要推翻党和工人阶级领导的政权，让反革命统治复辟。我们必须加倍地提高警惕，对工人阶级的死敌给以无情的打击。
    中国食品公司建德支公司朱育义来信：胡风的反党反人民的集团已在舒芜所揭露的材料中完全证实了。我是一个新中国的青年，是中华人民共和国的一个普通公民。我要在党的报纸上控诉和发表自己的意见。我坚决地要求撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格。
    胡风这一个杀人不见血的凶手，胡风这一个披着羊皮的狼，二十多年来一贯地干着反党、反人民、反革命的罪恶勾当。直到解放后，他仍然伪装成革命者，混在革命队伍里。他要“联络人”“争取人”
  “从事开辟工作”“大大地加强实力”，来同我们的革命事业对抗。胡风的反党、反人民的罪恶勾当已达到丧心病狂的地步。如果再让他及其集团成员存在、发展和扩大下去、真如五月十八日“人民日报”按语中所郑重指出那样，会给我们的革命事业以严重的损害。
    胡风的反党、反人民是具有政治阴谋的，这不止是文艺界的事，胡风的错误决不是仅仅在思想上。我们各个岗位上的青年们都有责任围剿胡风及其集团，以达到全部歼灭干净为止。
    我是一个商业战线上的士兵，我坚决地响应党的号召，百倍地提高警惕，不让这帮冒称革命者的伪装分子残留下来。
    太原市人民银行袁振华来信：胡风这个鬼计多端的反革命分子，隐蔽在我们革命阵营里，暗地里进行着反革命的活动，阴谋获得反动政权的复辟。且看胡风给他的党羽张中晓的信中说的“不要痛苦，千万冷静。还有许多事情我们得忍受，并且只有在忍受中求得重生，一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来！”我看到这里，不禁咬牙跺脚，击掌捶胸地喊出来：好一个“远大的未来！”这个家伙的用意是十分阴险呀！你不老老实实地向人民低头，还想更进一步地向我们革命事业进行猖狂的进攻。告诉你吧：旧时代一去不复返了。我们的眼睛是雪亮的，再不受你的害，不上你的当了。我要求政府严厉惩办这个反革命分子。
    中国人民银行景县支行吕峰来信：我是在农村工作的干部。最近报纸所揭发的事实使我们很清楚地看出了胡风的凶恶面目，他披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，进行反革命活动。胡风不但在思想上作反党反人民的反革命活动，而且在组织上，搜罗文艺战线上的败类向党内外有成绩的作家恶毒地反扑。他痛恨进步作家，好像美帝国主义痛恨年青的新中国一样。他仇视中国人民的解放，不正如美帝国主义千方百计地训练特务、利用中国人民的公敌蒋介石破坏我们祖国建设一样吗？胡风所主张的“主观战斗精神”，是想把人们引向顽固的反动堡垒。为什么胡风这样坚决呢？他可能有个不可告人的背景。胡风这种毒辣的手段，实在令人愤怒。
    警告胡风之流，任何伪装都是掩耳盗铃的愚蠢行为，我建议有关部门对于胡风反革命集团，要予以彻底追究。
    山东省高密县第五区工作人员燕平来信：看了报上公布出舒芜揭露胡风的反党材料后，我认清了胡风是个奸险的反革命分子，是一贯同党和人民为敌的。是把黄连蛋滚上一层糖，用“滋补品”的名义来毒害我们青年的幌大夫。因此我对这些罪行表示切齿的愤恨，我要求政府严厉地惩处他。
    我在这里要向胡风声讨：胡风！告诉你，你的蒙头被我们撕破了。你那丑恶的狰狞面孔露出来了。你是一个什么样的立场和政治面貌，现在也清楚地毕露在人民面前了。你的欺骗手段快包起来吧！再耍任何手腕，都只能是变本加厉的反动行为。警告你，老老实实地低下头，向人民认罪是你的出路，不要在那里假检讨，拉拉盖，装猴作像，要知道这种态度不改变，人民是不轻饶你的。
    我是个青年，决心参加这个斗争，而且要动员我区的全体青年向你开火，向你斗争，不战到最后胜利是决不罢休的。
    青年团文化部机关总支委员会全体团员来信：现将我们团总支一百二十八名团员一致举手通过的、关于要求严惩胡风反党集团的公开信寄给你们。我们清楚地认识到胡风集团的问题已不是什么思想问题，而是严重的反革命集团破坏我们革命事业的政治问题。我们完全拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议所作的五项决议，并建议继续彻底追清胡风集团反党反人民的政治背景，按着国家法律予以严惩。
    我们全体青年团员保证在今后的实际工作中、斗争中加强政治学习，提高政治警惕性，不让一个反革命分子轻易破坏我们的革命事业，为保证社会主义建设事业的顺利进行而奋斗！
    华东文物工作队吴震来信：我是一个考古工作者。看了“人民日报”先后两次发表的揭露胡风反党集团的反革命罪恶活动的材料后，我感到万分愤慨。现在我们知道了：胡风及其反党集团老早就不仅是我们思想上的敌人，而且是政治方面的敌人了。为了纯洁革命队伍，必须愈早愈好地把胡风集团中的坚决反党分子从革命队伍中清除出去，并要根据他们的反动罪行给以应得的惩处。
    通过这一事实，我进一步认识到必须努力学习马克思列宁主义，积极参加批判资产阶级反动思想的斗争，坚决摆脱资产阶级思想对我们的影响。只有这样，我们在为祖国的社会主义建设事业的每项斗争中才能避免或减少错误；才能透过各种复杂的现象认识事物的本质；才能及时揭穿那些披着进步伪装的敌人而不致上他们的当。
    包头市有线广播站徐霁萍来信：我是一个广播工作者。过去对胡风是不太熟悉的，自从全国展开批判胡风运动后，我也只是认为他的作品中的思想、观点有些毛病而已。读了五月十三日“人民日报”上胡风的所谓“我的自我批判”及舒芜所揭发的材料后，我才大吃一惊！胡风问题原来不是一般知识分子的思想问题，而是严重的政治问题。
    从所揭发的材料可以看出，胡风和帝国主义特务分子、反革命分子是毫无区别的，甚至更阴险、毒辣。胡风的笑是他的工作方式，杀，却是他的目的。他企图扼杀我们革命事业。
    胡风是把希望寄托在反革命政权的复辟和人民革命政权的倒台上，对这样的反革命分子，我们坚决要求镇压他。我要求立即撤销他的全国人民代表大会的代表资格。
    我坚决响应党报的号召，在我的工作中注意辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子，把他们从我们每个战线上清除出去，保卫我们已经取得和将要取得的伟大胜利。
    山西人民广播电台王志迅来信：关于胡风反党集团两批材料的揭露，使我们认识到胡风集团根本不是什么“作家”，而是一群披着人皮的狼。
    我是一个曾经受过胡风的反动理论毒害的青年。解放以前，在国民党统治区，我自己和一些同学们曾为胡风各种各样的美丽装璜所欺骗。由于受他的思想毒害，有好几次同学们约我到解放区，我都拒绝了。他引导青年们脱离群众、远离革命斗争，从而达到他破坏革命、瓦解革命的愿望，这难道是偶然的吗？
    以前，我还认为这是一个思想问题，而不是一个政治问题。我们对胡风的警惕性是太低了，我们对这个阴险的家伙是太忠厚了。原来就是这个满口
  “马列主义”、满口“革命”的胡风，却正是钻在革命队伍里的有“组织原则”、有“斗争纲领”，极端仇视革命、反对革命、仇视党、反对党的反革命分子。
    我们不能再沉默了。我们被他们欺骗得够了。我们决不能让他们再来用“集束手榴弹”打击革命，我们坚决要求撤销胡风用两面派手段骗取到的
  一切职务，并把他逮捕法办。
    山东省司法厅王震、魏志平、张树智来信：我们是司法机关的工作人员。我们热烈拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议关于开除反党反人民集团首脑分子胡风作家协会会籍，撤销胡风所担任的职务及建议撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表资格的决议。
    胡风二十多年来，披着马克思主义的外衣，打着文艺理论家的招牌，到处散布资产阶级唯心论的思想，组织反党反人民的集团，寻找每一个机会向党向人民发动进攻，他的罪恶是深重的。从揭发出来的材料看，胡风的党羽还潜伏在我们的某些部门内，因此，我们必须提高警惕，坚决地将这一斗争进行到底。
    重工业部地质局张必达来信：反革命分子胡风的反党、反人民、反革命活动的罪行，使我非常愤怒。我们伟大的党和人民一直对待胡风是仁至义尽的，而黑了良心的反革命分子胡风不仅轻视党和人民对他的信赖，使他当选为全国人民代表大会的代表，反之，他却疯狂地在进行反革命活动。这是任何人都不能宽恕的。
    现在全国人民都在信心百倍地建设着伟大祖国，我们一定要建设社会主义社会，不论反革命的胡风集团和一切反革命分子如何猖狂，如何挖尽心思企图破坏我们的伟大事业，他们是一定要失败的。我们决不允许胡风反革命集团继续破坏我们的事业，我要求首先把胡风从革命队伍中清除出去，并依法予以严惩！
    鞍山黑色冶金设计院赵铁伦来信：从报纸所揭露的关于胡风反党集团的材料来看，胡风这个罪恶的阴谋家是非常仇视共产党和人民的。他的集团的活动，是有组织、有计划、有策略、有战术的。由此我们就不能不怀疑胡风反党集团是否有着后台主子的支持，因此必须彻底清查这一反党反革命集团的全部活动。
    我是一个工程技术工作者。我和其他热心于祖国建设事业的人一样，以忘我的劳动参加祖国的社会主义建设。因此，对胡风反党集团的罪恶活动不能不感到极大愤怒。我们必须彻底粉碎这个反党集团；对于首恶分子胡风应该依法给以严惩。
    汽车工业管理局童萍来信：对照地读完了胡风的所谓“我的自我批判”和舒芜所揭发的材料以及五月二十四日党报所载的第二批材料，只要稍具革命正义感的读者，都会大为震惊和无比的愤怒！胡风这个腐朽透顶的两面派的坏家伙已是体无完肤地暴露在人民的面前，他不但不能冠以“人类灵魂的工程师”的崇高称号，就连做一个起码的普通人民的条件在他身上也是找不到的。请看看他的糜烂发臭的字句吧：他把中共中央称为“董事会”，把毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”这部天才著作称为
  “被当作了‘图腾’的小册子”，把党员作家和进步的作家视为“蛆虫”，“市侩”“投机”，“苍蝇蚊子”“强盗和骗子”……这一切都说明胡风对党，对我们伟大的领袖，对人民是极为仇视的，也说明胡风以及胡风反党集团二十多年来是在伪装进步、披着马克思列宁主义外衣用各种卑劣的手段在进行着阴谋的破坏活动的。胡风的反党集团是很早就有了组织，有了计划，有了纲领，有了纪律的。他不惜一切手段指示他的走卒们用各种方法潜进党、军队、机关、工矿、学校、报社盗窃党内文件，探听情报，有计划地进行破坏，这同美帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮所派遣的特务有什么不同呢？为了彻底粉碎这一“蛇窟”，我们必须弄清胡风集团的政治背景，清算他们的罪行。
    我完全支持群众的一致呼声，完全拥护中国文联和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议所作出的决议。
    我们呼吁：必须要撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并建议检察机关对胡风集团进行彻查。
    胡风集团的一切分子应该赶快向人民交代认罪，要知道只有彻底坦白才是唯一的出路，如果仍是执迷不悟，等待你们的将是无情的判决。
    中共浙江省义乌县东河区委员会楼关松来信：我是一个农村工作干部。胡风在革命队伍里，吃着人民的饭，却干着反革命的勾当，谁能容忍他这种罪恶！我们要坚决打倒这种挂羊头卖狗肉、人面兽心的人。胡风对我们党“积了太多的愤恨”，向我们党不断“冲锋”，不断攻击，他用杀人不见血的手段，用“橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”来鞭打我们的党和文艺界的同志们，这同法西斯特务有什么两样！我们要彻底清算胡风反党集团的罪行。
