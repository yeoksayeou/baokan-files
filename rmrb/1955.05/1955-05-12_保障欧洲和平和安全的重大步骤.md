　　A Major Step in Guaranteeing European Peace and Security
    The governments of the eight countries that participated in the Moscow Conference on Guaranteeing European Peace and Security in 1954 are holding a meeting in Warsaw starting yesterday to discuss the issue of the eight countries concluding a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance, and the organization of a joint command of the treaty participating countries. The Government of the People's Republic of China has sent its observers to participate in this meeting. The holding of the Warsaw meeting is a necessary action taken by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving European countries to block the road to a new war. It is of extraordinary and urgent importance for guaranteeing European and world peace, as well as the security of the participating countries themselves. Peace-loving people all over the world warmly welcome the convening of the Warsaw meeting and regard it as a major step for international peace forces to resolutely defend peace.
    The Warsaw meeting was convened in response to the situation created by the US aggressive bloc and its followers in ratifying and implementing the Paris Agreements. The Declaration of the Eight Countries of the Moscow Conference issued on December 2, 1954, pointed out that the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements would deepen the danger of war and threaten the security of peace-loving European countries, especially the security of Germany's neighbors. The eight governments declared that if the Paris Agreements were ratified, the eight countries would have to take urgent measures to safeguard their own security and maintain European peace with their united forces. The declaration of the Moscow Conference was a manifestation of the firm will of peace-loving countries to defend peace. Encouraged by the strength of this declaration, the people of Europe and peace-loving people all over the world have waged and continue to wage a heroic struggle against the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements. However, the US aggressive bloc and its followers, regardless of all this, stubbornly insist on embarking on the road of reviving German militarism and preparing to launch a new war, and brazenly put the Paris Agreements into effect. This requires peace-loving countries to counter the arrogant war plans of the aggressive forces with resolute actions to strengthen their own defense capabilities.
    The implementation of the Paris Agreements by the US aggressive bloc and its followers to rearm West Germany and the actions of European peace-loving countries to strengthen their forces for defending peace are manifestations of the fierce struggle between international war forces and international peace forces. The course of this struggle is primarily determined by the balance of power between the two sides.
    The balance of power between peace forces and war forces has undergone fundamental changes since the end of World War II. Before World War II, only the Soviet Union resolutely stood on the front line of defending peace. Now, forming the main body of international peace forces alongside the Soviet Union is the socialist camp with a population of 900 million. In the past decade since the war, all countries in this camp have made tremendous progress in economic construction, and the unity within these countries and among them has been continuously consolidated and strengthened. This year, the Soviet Union will complete its Fifth Five-Year Plan, and its industrial output will reach more than three times the pre-war level. The Soviet Union has also fully mastered atomic energy. The speed of economic development in other countries of the socialist camp also far exceeds that of any capitalist country. Standing with this camp are the vast peace-loving people of all countries. The people of all countries yearn for the peaceful policies of the peace, democracy and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and regard the socialist camp, especially the Soviet Union, as a reliable fortress for defending peace. Therefore, the forces united under the banner of peace are much stronger than the war forces.
    The strength of international peace forces and the weakening of international war forces are clearly manifested in the development of the international situation since the war. The efforts of peace-loving forces around the world to strive for peace have constantly frustrated the US "policy of strength." The US aggressors single-handedly provoked the Korean War, but in the face of the powerful forces defending peace, they had to accept the Korean armistice. The Geneva Conference's agreement on restoring peace in Indochina was a serious blow to the US aggressive bloc's attempt to expand this war policy. Due to the opposition of the people of Europe, the "European Defense Community" plan concocted by the United States collapsed. Recently, the advocacy of peace and opposition to war has become increasingly popular. At the Asian-African Conference, despite the US aggressive bloc's best efforts to provoke and sabotage, the 29 countries of Asia and Africa, which have more than half of the world's population, unanimously adopted the declaration on promoting world peace and cooperation and the resolution against colonialism. International peace forces achieved victory here, while international war forces suffered a shameful defeat. At the same time, the agreement of the Soviet-Austrian talks greatly strengthened the confidence of the people of all countries, especially the German people, in opposing the implementation of the Paris Agreements and striving for a peaceful solution to the German question through consultation.
    However, the US aggressive bloc and its followers are not reconciled to their failures. While using the lies of "peace" to paralyze the people, they are determined to push through their plans to prepare for a new war. Implementing the Paris Agreements is a major step for the imperialist war forces to prepare to launch a new war. The implementation of this agreement has enabled the most aggressive German militarist forces to rebuild a Hitler-style "national defense force" and form a military alliance with the US aggressive bloc. Its spearhead is aimed at the Soviet Union and the people's democracies of Europe. This approach by the US aggressive bloc and its followers has brought about a serious change in the European situation and greatly increased the danger of a new war.
    The US aggressive bloc's war policy not only threatens Europe, but also threatens Asia and other places. While reviving German militarism in Europe to prepare for a new war of aggression, the United States is also intensifying its war preparations and aggression in Asia. The main target of these activities is the People's Republic of China. The US aggressors signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang last December, and recently established the so-called military "joint center" in Taipei. The United States is single-mindedly trying to "arm" the Manila military alliance and convened the Bangkok Conference in February for this purpose, and the Baguio Conference recently. The United States openly and shamelessly interferes in South Vietnam's internal affairs in order to further undermine the Geneva Conference's agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue. The United States instigated Turkey and Iraq to form a military alliance in the Middle East and created disputes and discord among Arab countries. All this makes the people of Asia face an increasingly serious danger of a new war, just like the people of Europe.
    The peace and security of Asia are inseparable from the peace and security of Europe, and the interests of the People's Republic of China are inseparable from the interests of the peace-loving countries of Europe. The Chinese people are determined to fight to safeguard peace and security in Asia. At the same time, we must stand with the people of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies of Europe and fully support all the measures they take to safeguard European peace and their own security. Vice Premier Peng Dehuai, who attended the Warsaw meeting as an observer, will express the Chinese people's firm will to unite with the people of our brother countries and jointly conduct the anti-aggression struggle.
    The current policy of the US aggressive bloc is to plunge all mankind into a new world war. This policy is full of madness and adventurousness. While peace-loving countries must make every possible effort to strive for peace and ease tensions, they cannot but be prepared for the adventurous war that the imperialist aggressive forces may launch. The Warsaw meeting will make necessary decisions in this regard to strengthen the unity and cooperation among peace-loving countries, strengthen their defense capabilities, and prevent possible sudden incidents. This will also protect peace-loving countries from any accidents and block the US aggressive bloc's road to launching a new war in Europe. In this case, if the imperialist aggressive forces dare to take the risk of launching a new world war, the result will inevitably be the complete defeat of the imperialist camp and the complete collapse of the entire capitalist system.
    The people of the world are watching the Warsaw meeting and expect the achievements of this meeting. We are deeply convinced that with the support of peace-loving people all over the world and on the basis of the rock-solid unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, the Warsaw meeting will certainly be able to make great contributions to European and world peace.

### 保障欧洲和平和安全的重大步骤

　　保障欧洲和平和安全的重大步骤
    参加一九五四年在莫斯科召开的保障欧洲和平和安全会议的八国政府，从昨天起在华沙举行会议，讨论八国缔结友好合作互助条约的问题和组织条约参加国的联合司令部的问题。中华人民共和国政府派遣了自己的观察员参加这个会议。华沙会议的举行是苏联和欧洲其他爱好和平的国家为了堵塞新战争的道路而采取的必要行动，这对于保障欧洲和世界和平以及参加会议国家的自身安全都有着异常紧迫的重要性。全世界爱好和平人民热烈欢迎华沙会议的召开，并把它看作是国际和平力量坚决保卫和平的重大步骤。
    华沙会议是针对着美国侵略集团及其追随者批准和实施巴黎协定所造成的局势而召开的。一九五四年十二月二日发表的莫斯科会议八国宣言曾指出，巴黎协定的批准和实施将加深战争的危险，并且将威胁到爱好和平的欧洲国家的安全，特别是德国邻国的安全。八国政府宣告，如果巴黎协定被批准，那么，八国将不得不采取迫切的措施，用它们联合起来的力量，来保障自身的安全并维持欧洲和平。莫斯科会议的宣言是爱好和平国家保卫和平的坚决意志的表现。在这个宣言力量的鼓舞下，欧洲各国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民为反对批准和实施巴黎协定，进行了并继续进行着英勇的斗争。但是，美国侵略集团及其追随者不顾这一切，顽固地要走上复活德国军国主义和准备发动新战争的道路，而悍然使巴黎协定开始生效。这就使得爱好和平的国家必须以加强自己的防御力量的坚决行动，来对付侵略势力的狂妄的战争计划。
    美国侵略集团及其追随者重新武装西德的巴黎协定的实施，和欧洲爱好和平国家加强保卫和平力量的行动，是国际战争势力和国际和平力量之间激烈斗争的表现。这个斗争的进程，首先决定于双方力量的对比。
    和平力量和战争势力的力量对比，在第二次世界大战结束以来有了根本的变化。在第二次世界大战以前，只有苏联一个社会主义国家坚决地站在捍卫和平的前线。现在，同苏联在一道形成国际和平力量主体的是拥有九亿人口的社会主义阵营。战后十年来，这个阵营的所有国家在经济建设方面都有了巨大的发展，而且在这些国家的内部和它们相互之间的团结也在不断地巩固和加强。今年苏联将完成第五个五年计划，它的工业产量将达到战前三倍多的水平。苏联并已全面地掌握了原子能。社会主义阵营其他国家经济发展的速度，也都远超过任何资本主义国家。和这个阵营站在一起的有各国广大的爱好和平的人民。各国人民向往着以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的和平政策，并且把社会主义阵营，特别是苏联，看作是保卫和平的可靠的堡垒。因此，团结在和平旗帜下的力量比起战争势力要强大得多。
    国际和平力量的强大和国际战争势力的削弱，清楚地表现在战后以来国际局势的发展上面。全世界爱好和平力量争取和平的努力，曾使美国的“实力”政策不断遭到挫败。美国侵略者一手挑起了朝鲜战争，但是在强大的保卫和平力量的面前，它不得不接受了朝鲜停战。日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议，是对美国侵略集团力图扩大这个战争政策的严重打击。由于欧洲各国人民的反对，美国所策划的“欧洲防务集团”计划宣告垮台。最近以来，赞成和平、反对战争的主张越来越深入人心。在亚非会议上，尽管美国侵略集团曾千方百计地进行挑拨和破坏，但是拥有全世界一半以上人口的亚洲和非洲的二十九个国家，还是一致通过了促进世界和平和合作的宣言和反对殖民主义的决议。国际和平力量在这里取得了胜利，国际战争势力却遭受了可耻的失败。与此同时，苏奥会谈的协议大大加强了各国人民，特别是德国人民反对实施巴黎协定、争取以和平协商方式解决德国问题的斗争信心。
    但是，美国侵略集团及其追随者对于它们的失败却死不甘心。它们一面用“和平”的谎话麻痹人民，一面却要把它们准备新战争的计划推行到底。实施巴黎协定就是帝国主义战争势力准备发动新战争的一个重大的步骤。这个协定的实施已使最富侵略性的德国军国主义势力能够重建一支希特勒式的
  “国防军”，并同美国侵略集团结成军事同盟。它的矛头是对着苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家的。美国侵略集团及其追随者的这种做法，已使欧洲局势发生了严重变化，使新战争的危险大大增加起来。
    美国侵略集团的战争政策不仅威胁着欧洲，而且也威胁着亚洲和其他地方。美国在欧洲复活德国军国主义，以准备发动新的侵略战争的同时，它在亚洲地区也同样地加紧了备战活动和侵略活动。这些活动的主要矛头是针对着中华人民共和国的。美国侵略者在去年十二月间同蒋介石匪帮签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，最近又在台北建立了所谓军事
  “联合中心”机构。美国一心一意地要为马尼拉军事同盟“装上牙齿”，为此在二月份召开了曼谷会议，在最近又召开了碧瑶会议。美国公开无耻地干涉南越内政，以便进而破坏日内瓦会议关于和平解决印度支那问题的协议。美国在中东策动土耳其、伊拉克缔结军事同盟，并在阿拉伯国家间制造纷争和不和。所有这一切，就使亚洲人民和欧洲人民一样面临着日益严重的新战争的危险。
    亚洲的和平和安全同欧洲的和平和安全是分不开的，中华人民共和国的利益同欧洲爱好和平国家的利益是分不开的。中国人民坚决为保障亚洲的和平和安全而斗争。同时，我们也一定要同苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家的人民站在一起，全力支持他们为保障欧洲和平和本身的安全而采取的一切措施。以观察员身份出席华沙会议的彭德怀副总理将表达出中国人民同我们兄弟国家人民团结一致、共同进行反侵略斗争的坚决意志。
    美国侵略集团的现行政策是要使全人类陷入新的世界大战。这种政策充满了疯狂性和冒险性。爱好和平的国家一方面必须为争取和平和缓和紧张局势作一切可能的努力，同时对于帝国主义侵略势力可能发动起来的冒险战争不能不有所准备。华沙会议将在这方面作出必要的决定，来加强爱好和平国家之间的团结和合作，加强它们的防御力量，以预防可能发生的突然事变。这也将使爱好和平的国家免遭任何意外，并堵塞住美国侵略集团在欧洲发动新战争的道路。在这种情况下，帝国主义侵略势力如果真敢于冒险发动新的世界大战，那么，其结果就必然是帝国主义阵营的彻底败亡，整个资本主义体系的完全崩溃。
    全世界人民注视着华沙会议，并且期望着这个会议的成就。我们深信，在全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家坚如磐石般的团结一致的基础上，华沙会议一定能够对于欧洲和世界和平作出巨大的贡献。
