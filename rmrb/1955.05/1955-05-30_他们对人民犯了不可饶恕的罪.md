　　They Have Committed Unforgivable Crimes Against the People
　　Liu Xi
    We often say: Beware of the murderers by your side! And the murderers are right by our side!
    We had always treated Hu Feng as a friend in the past, but he took advantage of our trust in him to carry out counter-revolutionary activities in a planned and organized way. They took advantage of our criticism and self-criticism, and took advantage of the opportunity of our rectification and inspection work to attack us.
    Now everything is clear. How bitterly Hu Feng hated the revolution! How meticulously planned were all the actions of the Hu Feng clique! Hu Feng planned to launch attacks against us, planned to steal our Party documents, planned to develop their organization, and planned to infiltrate our state organs and people's organizations to act as spies, seize power, expand their influence, and expand their territory. Their actions were so sneaky, their schemes were so shameless, that they were even "wary" of the correspondents sent by the Writers Association to take care of their lives. What were they wary of? This is not difficult to imagine.
    The counter-revolutionary activities carried out by Hu Feng and his clique were extremely concealed and insidious; however, no matter how well you disguise yourself, you will eventually escape the sharp eyes of the Party and the people. Our well-trained Party and hard-working and courageous people have defeated enemies who are superior to us in both number and equipment, and of course we will also be able to defeat the conspiracies of Hu Feng and his clique. We have now achieved victory!
    I demand that the state punish these counter-revolutionary elements according to law and thoroughly investigate everything about them, because they have committed unforgivable crimes against the motherland and the people.

　　他们对人民犯了不可饶恕的罪
　　柳溪
    我们常常说：谨防你身旁的凶手！而凶手就在我们
    的身旁！
    我们过去一直把胡风当成朋友，他却利用了我们对他的信任，来有计划、有组织地进行反革命的活动。他们利用我们的批评和自我批评，利用我们整顿检查工作的时机，向我们进攻。
    现在一切都明白了，胡风是怎样咬牙切齿地痛恨革命啊！胡风集团的一切行动，是怎样地经过周密审慎的计划啊！胡风有计划地布置对我们的攻击、有计划地窃取我们党的文件、有计划地发展他们的组织和有计划地打进我们国家机关和人民团体内部充当坐探，把持势力，扩充地盘，他们的行动是这样的鬼祟，他们的计谋是这样的无耻，连对作家协会为了照顾他们的生活而派的通讯员都存有“戒心”，他们戒备什么？这是不难想像的。
    胡风及其集团所进行的反革命活动，是极其隐蔽和恶毒的；但是，不管你伪装得多么像样，终于逃不出党和人民雪亮的眼睛。我们久经锻炼的党和勤劳勇敢的人民，曾经战胜过在数量和装备都优于我们的敌人，当然也能够战胜胡风及其集团的阴谋活动。我们现在已经取得了胜利！
    我要求国家依法惩处这些反革命分子，彻底查清他们的一切，因为他们对于祖国、对于人民，犯下了不可饶恕的罪。
