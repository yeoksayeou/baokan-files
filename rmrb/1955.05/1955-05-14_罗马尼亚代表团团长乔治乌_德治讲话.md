Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 13th: Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, head of the government delegation of the Romanian People's Republic and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, delivered a speech on the 12th at the Warsaw Conference of European Countries on Ensuring Peace and Security in Europe.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that plans to revive German militarism are causing justifiable concern among the people of European countries. The Romanian government fully agrees with Comrade Bulganin's views expressed at the meeting, and with the Soviet government's views on striving to establish normal relations between countries.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that the Romanian People's Republic attaches great importance to cooperation and friendship with neighboring countries, in order to benefit mutual security and peaceful development. The Romanian government believes it is necessary to emphasize the improvement of good-neighborly relations with Yugoslavia.

Gheorghiu-Dej continued, "The development of the international situation, and the events taking place in Europe and Asia, show that despite the aggressive blocs' efforts to obstruct the resolution of international problems, and despite their conspiracies to plunge the world into the abyss of a new world war, the forces of peace are constantly developing and strengthening. There are effective opportunities in the international situation to ease international tensions."

Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized that the Romanian People's Republic, together with all peace-loving countries, will continue to fight with greater determination and energy to ease international tensions. The Romanian people are convinced that peace-loving countries have every possibility and ability to block the path to war, isolate the enemies of human peace and freedom, and bring their plans to bankruptcy. The measures taken at this conference will greatly help to achieve this.

Gheorghiu-Dej concluded by saying that the conclusion of a treaty of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance by the countries participating in this conference, and the organization of a joint command, will strengthen the overall cooperation between the eight countries, consolidate their international position, and create the conviction that no aggressor will be able to catch them unprepared. These measures will greatly strengthen the defense forces of these countries, and will establish a necessary force capable of ensuring peace and security in Europe.

　　罗马尼亚代表团团长乔治乌—德治讲话
    新华社华沙十三日电　罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团团长、部长会议主席乔治乌—德治，十二日在欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全的华沙会议上发了言。
    乔治乌—德治说，复活德国军国主义的计划引起欧洲各国人民理所当然的忧虑。罗马尼亚政府完全同意布尔加宁同志在会议上所表示的、苏联政府关于力求建立各国间的正常关系的问题的看法。
    乔治乌—德治说，罗马尼亚人民共和国十分重视同邻邦国家的合作和友谊，以利于彼此的安全和和平发展。罗马尼亚政府认为必须着重指出同南斯拉夫的睦邻关系的改善。
    乔治乌—德治接着说，国际局势的发展、欧洲和亚洲所发生的事件表明：尽管侵略集团在解决国际问题方面百般阻挠，尽管他们阴谋把世界推入新的世界大战的深渊，但是和平的力量在不断发展，在不断增强，在国际情势中存在着有效的机会来和缓国际紧张局势。
    乔治乌—德治着重说，罗马尼亚人民共和国同所有爱好和平的国家一起，今后将以更大的决心、精力为缓和国际紧张局势而斗争。罗马尼亚人民确信：爱好和平的国家有着一切的可能和能力来堵塞战争的道路，使人类和平和自由的敌人陷于孤立，使他们的计划归于破产。我们这次会议所采取的措施将大大有助于做到这一点。
    乔治乌—德治最后说，参加这次会议的各国缔结友好、合作和互助条约，组织联合司令部，就将加强八国之间的全面合作，巩固它们的国际地位，并创造这样的信念：任何侵略者将不能使它们措手不及。这些措施将大大加强我们这几个国家的防御力量，将建立一支能够保障欧洲和平和安全的必要力量。
