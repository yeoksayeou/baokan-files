National agricultural loans issued by state banks this spring have reached 350 million yuan as of the end of March. Tens of thousands of agricultural producers' cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers have purchased a large number of means of production such as draft animals, fertilizers, farm tools, seeds, waterwheels, and pumps after receiving state loans. This year, state banks in various regions have generally paid attention to ensuring that the issuance of loans meets actual needs. Many bank staff members have helped agricultural cooperatives tap their internal funding potential and rationally determine the amount of loans by reviewing the agricultural cooperatives' production plans and financial plans. This has saved funds for the country and avoided excessive debt for agricultural cooperatives. The Dongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tangtan Township, Shipai District, Zhongxiang County, Hubei Province, originally planned to request a loan of 1,600 yuan from the state bank. After the bank staff helped the cooperative calculate detailed production and financial accounts, it was determined that a loan of only 203 yuan would be sufficient to overcome the difficulties in production.

　　全国今春发放农业贷款三亿五千万元
    截至三月底的统计，今春国家银行发放的农业贷款已达三亿五千万元。数以万计的农业生产合作社、互助组以及个体农民得到国家贷款后，购买了大批耕畜、肥料、农具、种籽、水车、抽水机等生产资料。今年各地国家银行在发放贷款工作中，一般都注意使贷款的发放切合实际需要。许多地区的银行工作人员通过审查农业生产合作社的生产计划和财务计划，帮助农业社挖掘了社内资金潜力，合理确定贷款数目，既为国家节约了资金，又使农业社避免了欠债过多的情况。湖北钟祥县石牌区唐滩乡东兴农业生产合作社原计划请求国家银行借给贷款一千六百元，后经银行工作人员帮助该社算生产和财务的细账，只贷给二百零三元即可克服生产中的困难。
