Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 28th: Delhi newspapers on May 28th generally published commentaries on the summary report of the Indonesian Investigation Committee regarding the "Kashmir Princess" plane crash, severely condemning the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's special agents' despicable act of murder.

    "Indian Express" published an editorial saying, "The Indian government and people, like all other governments and peoples who cherish decency in international relations, are deeply shocked by the almost unbelievable and extremely vicious nature of this tragedy."

    "Hindustan Flag" published an editorial stating that the conspiracy to sabotage the plane has been established beyond doubt. It has been finally proven that a time bomb was placed in the right wing wheel well of the plane before it took off from Hong Kong, and it should be possible to find out when it was placed and by whom. The editorial said that tracking down the real criminals should not be beyond the capabilities of skilled detectives. But this can only be achieved if the Hong Kong authorities cooperate unreservedly with the criminal investigation work.

    "The Times of India" editorial called on the Hong Kong authorities to track down the criminals who placed the time bomb on the plane, demanding not only the tracking down of those who actually committed this most despicable act, but also the instigators of this crime. The editorial also said, "It is not enough to punish only the saboteurs. To ensure that sabotage does not occur in the future, the authorities must very carefully screen all the staff employed at the airport and purge the many suspicious elements who are taking refuge in this colony today."

    "Hindustan Times" editorial said that from the current situation, China has fully proven that their claims are correct.

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 29th: Indian newspapers continue to comment on the summary report of the Indonesian Investigation Committee regarding the "Kashmir Princess" plane crash.

    "Glory" published an editorial on the 28th saying that the report of the Indonesian Investigation Committee "exposes the propaganda lies of the American agents: that the crash of the Indian plane was caused by engine failure." The editorial pointed out that the purpose of this distorted propaganda was to "divert the investigators' attention from the real cause."

    "Amrita Bazar Patrika" said on the 28th: The accusations from China should no longer be ignored. The Hong Kong authorities should "promptly conduct a thorough, competent, and impartial investigation into the circumstances of the plane's departure from Hong Kong, in order to apprehend and punish those who, for their political interests, committed this crime unprecedented in modern history."

    "Hindustan Daily" also demanded in its editorial on the 28th that the Hong Kong authorities conduct a thorough investigation into the conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek special agents.

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 29th: The Indian newspaper "The Statesman" reported on the 28th that a staff member who was on duty at the airport when the "Kashmir Princess" plane was being inspected during its stopover in Hong Kong has fled to Taiwan. Irrefutable evidence proves that this person, whose name has not been revealed, should be held responsible for the sabotage of the plane.

　　印度报纸要香港当局迅速追查破坏飞机罪犯
    新华社新德里二十八日电　德里报纸二十八日普遍就印度尼西亚调查委员会关于“克什米尔公主号”飞机失事事件的报告摘要发表评论，严厉斥责蒋介石卖国集团特务分子卑鄙的谋杀行为。
    “印度快报”发表社论说，“印度政府和人民像其他所有珍视国际关系中正派作风的政府和人民一样，对于这次惨案的几乎难以置信的穷凶极恶的性质深感震惊。”
    “印度斯坦旗报”发表社论说，破坏飞机的阴谋已经毫无怀疑地确定了。已经最后证明有一颗定时炸弹在飞机在香港起飞前被放在飞机右翼轮舱处，那就应当能够查出这是什么时候放的以及谁放的。社论说，追踪真正的罪犯当不是超出机灵的侦探们的才能的事情。但是只有在香港当局无保留地与罪犯调查工作合作的情况下才能做到。
    “印度时报”的社论要求香港当局追查在飞机上放置定时炸弹的罪犯，要求不仅要追查那些实际干这件最卑鄙勾当的人，而且要追查这一罪行的唆使者。社论还说，“仅仅惩罚破坏分子是不够的。为了保证今后不再发生破坏行动，当局必须非常仔细地甄别机场雇用的全部工作人员，肃清今天在这个殖民地上避难的许多可疑分子。”
    “印度斯坦时报”的社论说，从现在情况看来，中国已经完全证明了他们的说法是对的。
    新华社新德里二十九日电　印度报纸继续评论印度尼西亚调查委员会关于“克什米尔公主号”飞机失事事件的报告摘要。
    “光荣报”二十八日发表社论说，印度尼西亚调查委员会的报告“揭穿了美国代理人的宣传谎言：印度飞机的坠毁是由于引擎发生毛病而造成的”。社论指出，这种歪曲宣传的目的是想“转移调查人员对于真正原因的注意”。
    “甘露市场报”二十八日说：来自中国的指责不应再被忽视。香港当局应该“迅速对这一飞机从香港起飞时的情况进行彻底的、有能力的和公正的调查，以便查获并惩罚那些为了他们的政治利益而犯了这种在近代历史上没有前例的罪行的人”。
    “印度斯坦日报”也在二十八日的社论中要求香港当局对蒋介石特务分子的阴谋进行彻底的调查。
    新华社新德里二十九日电　印度“政治家报”二十八日谈到当“克什米尔公主号”飞机在香港停留被检修时曾在机场上值班的一个职员已经逃往台湾的消息说，无可辩驳的证据证明，这个没有被指出名字的人应该对这次飞机被破坏的事件负责。
