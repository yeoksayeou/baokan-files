　　Correctly Resolve the Issue of Water Wells Joining Cooperatives to Expand Irrigated Area
　　Yan Mingxiang
    The yield of land irrigated by well water is generally one or two times higher than that of dry land. Because each well irrigates a small area, crops can receive timely and adequate moisture without the disadvantages of water loss, flooding, or soil alkalization. Well water irrigation is an important aspect of mass-based small-scale farmland water conservancy construction, which is suitable for the current economic characteristics of rural areas and can promote the development of mutual aid and cooperation. Therefore, in plain areas where river water is insufficient and groundwater resources are abundant, guiding farmers to develop well water irrigation is an effective measure to tap the production potential of land and ensure increased agricultural production.

    The development of agricultural production cooperatives and the collective management of land have created favorable conditions for further developing well water irrigation. However, judging from the situation in Shanxi Province, many regions have not paid attention to and supported this work. In 1954, the well-digging plan in Shanxi Province's water conservancy construction plan was only 33 percent completed. According to the materials currently available, the completion of this year's well-digging plan is even worse. Taking Xin County, which has good conditions for developing well water irrigation, as an example, only 15 percent of the well-digging plan was completed in 1954, and this work has not been widely carried out by the end of April this year. Why have these phenomena occurred? The main reason is that there are some ideological obstacles among the farmers. One is the thinking of mutual aid teams and individual farmers: "We will join the cooperative this year or next year anyway. It's a waste of money to dig wells now. Let's dig wells and install waterwheels after we join the cooperative." Another is the thinking of agricultural production cooperatives: "The newly established cooperatives have a large framework but a weak foundation. Let's turn dry land into irrigated land when we are stronger." The staff who lead agricultural production have also failed to conduct propaganda and mobilization among farmers in response to the above situation, and have relaxed their leadership over farmers' well-digging and irrigation work.

    Facts have proved that as long as we strengthen leadership, correctly implement policies, and let farmers realize that turning dry land into irrigated land is one of the most effective ways to increase grain production, we can improve farmers' enthusiasm for digging wells and installing waterwheels. The Buluo Township in Xin County launched the work of digging wells and installing waterwheels after solving these ideological problems. In addition to irrigating land with river water, existing well water irrigation, and high land that cannot be turned into irrigated land, this township can also develop 3,300 mu of irrigated land. In 1952, after Yang Yutian, a farmer in this township, turned 3.4 mu of dry land into well water irrigated land, which increased the yield per mu by more than two and a half times compared with dry land, the farmers in the township actively carried out the work of turning dry land into irrigated land. By the end of 1954, the township had dug a total of 39 water wells, installed 28 waterwheels, and expanded the irrigated area by 824 mu, increasing grain production by more than 210,000 jin compared with when it was dry land. However, this work stagnated in 1954, and the whole township only dug three wells and installed two waterwheels throughout the year. This year, the township plans to dig five wells, install five waterwheels, turn 150 mu of dry land into irrigated land, and increase production by 38,400 jin. Although the plan was made, the farmers were unwilling to follow the plan. Zhou Runhe (director of the Zengchan Agricultural Production Cooperative), secretary of the township branch, Wang Zhongde, township head, Zhang Chengbao (director of the Aiguo Agricultural Production Cooperative), director of water conservancy, and Cui Ermao (provincial labor model for high yield), director of the Lianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative, and others held a special meeting to examine and study this matter. Zhou Runhe first pointed out that the Party branch had not given correct solutions to the issues of production assessment for members' well-irrigated land joining the cooperative, depreciation and interest payment of waterwheels, and renting and use, and the Lianfeng, Aiguo, and Zengchan cooperatives had not reached a consensus on the issue of well-irrigated land joining the cooperative, which was the main obstacle to turning dry land into irrigated land. The well-irrigated land of the three cooperatives was assessed and joined the cooperative according to the yield of dry land, and the waterwheels were also used free of charge. Therefore, members and farmers outside the cooperative had concerns about the water wells and waterwheels being taken over by the public for nothing, and were not active in digging wells and installing waterwheels. Cui Ermao and Zhang Chengbao reviewed and said that the staff of Lianfeng Cooperative and Aiguo Cooperative did not see that a large amount of labor saved after the unified management of land could be used to actively carry out well-digging work, but instead acted cautiously everywhere, simply emphasizing that only increased investment could solve the problem. Everyone unanimously believed that if agricultural production cooperatives did not actively use the favorable conditions for carrying out well-digging work, they could not effectively increase production, and therefore could not play a leading and exemplary role among the masses. They studied appropriate methods for the issue of water wells and waterwheels joining the cooperative. They stipulated that when wells dug by members in 1952 and 1953 joined the cooperative, the actual yield of the land irrigated by these wells had already increased. Although the government rewarded the conversion of dry land to irrigated land with five years of no increase in agricultural tax, the yield of these lands should be assessed according to the actual yield. Wells joining the cooperative with the land were used by the cooperative, and repaired by the cooperative if they were damaged, but the ownership of the wells belonged to the members. Wells dug in 1954 had not yet benefited, there was no standard for production assessment, and the investment in digging wells was also high. Therefore, it was determined that the cost of digging wells should be borne by the cooperative as the cooperative's basic construction investment, and the ownership of the wells belonged to the cooperative. Regarding the issue of waterwheels joining the cooperative, everyone believed that renting and depreciation and interest payment were not appropriate, because members originally dug wells and installed waterwheels using loans borrowed from the bank, which were repaid in three to five years. Therefore, it was decided to depreciate and price the waterwheels joining the cooperative based on the current waterwheel price, the number of years of use, and the degree of damage, and the cooperative would repay the loans. After these methods were announced at the mass meeting, members and individual farmers considered them fair and reasonable. Individual farmer Liu Cunliang said: "This method is good, the waterwheels and water wells are not taken over by the public for nothing, and digging wells now and digging wells after joining the cooperative are not disadvantageous." As a result of this treatment of water wells and waterwheels, the loans that the cooperative had to repay to the bank in three to five years were only 160 yuan for the Aiguo Cooperative and only 200 yuan for the Lianfeng Cooperative, and the cooperative's investment did not increase much. After this treatment, the enthusiasm of members and individual farmers for digging wells and installing waterwheels has been improved. As of May 6, the Lianfeng Cooperative has led mutual aid teams and individual households to prepare the wood and stone for digging two wells, and the Aiguo Cooperative has also united mutual aid teams and individual farmers to install three waterwheels, turning 75 mu of dry land into irrigated land.

　　正确解决水井入社问题，扩大井水灌溉面积
　　阎明祥
    井水灌溉的土地，产量一般比旱地多一倍或一倍以上。由于每眼井灌溉的面积不多，能供给作物以适时适量的水分，而且没有失水淹地或土壤碱化的弊害。水井灌溉是群众性的小型农田水利建设的重要方面之一，既适合目前农村中的经济特点，又能促进互助合作的发展。所以，在河水不足、地下水源丰富的平原地区，指导农民发展井水灌溉，是发挥土地生产潜力，保证农业增产的一项有效措施。
    农业生产合作社的发展，土地的集体经营，给进一步发展井水灌溉创造了良好的条件。但是，从山西省的情况来看，许多地区对于这项工作没有重视和支持。一九五四年山西省水利建设计划中的打井计划只完成了百分之三十三。据目前所掌握的材料看，今年打井计划完成得更差。以井水灌溉发展条件良好的忻县为例，一九五四年打井计划只完成百分之十五，今年到四月底，这一工作还没有广泛开展起来。为什么产生了这些现象呢？这主要是在农民中普遍存在一些思想障碍。一种是互助组和个体农民的想法：今年不入社，明年也入社呀，现在打井白花钱，等入了社再打井安水车吧；一种是农业生产合作社的想法：新办起来的社，架子大，底子空，等力量大了再把旱地变水浇地吧。而领导农业生产的工作人员也没有针对上述情况向农民进行宣传动员，放松了对农民打井浇地工作的领导。
    事实证明，只要加强领导，正确地执行政策，让农民认识到把旱地变水浇地是增产粮食的最有效办法之一，就能提高农民打井安装水车的积极性。忻县部落乡就是在解决这些思想问题之后发动群众开展打井和安装水车工作的。这个乡除引河水浇地、现有井水浇地和不能变为水浇地的高地外，还能发展水浇地三千三百多亩。一九五二年这个乡的农民杨玉田把三亩四分旱地变成井水浇地，使每亩产量超过旱地产量两倍半以后，乡里的农民就曾经积极地开展了变旱地为水地的工作，到一九五四年年底，全乡共打成水井三十九眼，安装水车二十八部，扩大浇地面积八百二十四亩，比经营旱地时增产原粮二十一万多斤。但是这项工作在一九五四年停滞了下来，全乡全年只打了三眼井，安装了两部水车。今年全乡计划打井五眼，安水车五部，旱地变水地一百五十亩，增产三万八千四百斤。计划虽然是做出来了，但农民却不愿意照计划做。乡支部书记周润和（增产农业生产合作社社长）、乡长王仲德、水利主任张成豹（爱国农业生产合作社社长）、连丰农业生产合作社社长崔二卯（省丰产劳动模范）等专为这件事开会进行了检查和研究。周润和首先指出，党支部对社员井浇地入社的评产、水车折旧付息和租借使用等问题没有及时给予正确的解决，连丰、爱国、增产三个社在井地入社问题上没有取得一致意见，这是变旱地为水浇地的主要障碍。三个社井浇地都按旱地产量评产入了社，水车也是无偿使用。因此社员和社外农民都存有水井水车白归公的顾虑，不积极打井安水车。崔二卯、张成豹检讨说：连丰社和爱国社工作人员没有看到由于土地统一经营后节余的大批劳力，可以积极开展打井工作，而是处处小手小脚，单纯强调只有加大投资，才能解决问题。大家一致认为：农业生产合作社要是不积极利用开展打井工作的有利条件，就不能有效地增产，因而也就不能在群众中起带头示范作用。他们研究了本乡在发展井水灌溉方面的有利条件是：水源旺、水质好；每眼井能浇三十多亩地，天最旱也能八天到十天轮浇一次水；全村能变旱地为井浇地的地有三千多亩，完成这项建设，就能增产八十六万七千斤粮食。接着，他们对水井、水车的入社问题，采取了适当的办法。他们规定社员在一九五二年和一九五三年打的井入社时，因这些井所浇的地的实产量已经提高，虽然政府奖励旱地变水地五年不增加农业税，这些地的产量应按实产量评产。随地入社的井由社里使用，坏了由社修理，但井权归社员所有。一九五四年打的井尚未受益，评产没有标准，打井投资也多，因此确定打井所花的成本归社负担，作为社里基本建设投资，井权归社所有。关于水车入社问题，大家认为租借和折旧付息都不合适，因为社员原来打井安水车都是使用从银行借来的贷款，分三年到五年还清。因此决定以当前水车价格为标准，按已使用年限、损失程度，折旧作价入社，由社归还贷款。这些办法在群众大会上公布后，社员和个体农民都认为公平合理。个体农民刘存良说：“这个办法好，水车水井不白归公，现在打井和入社后打井，都不吃亏。”水井、水车这样处理的结果，由社在三年到五年归还银行的贷款，爱国社才有一百六十元，连丰社也只有二百元，社的投资增加也不多。经过这样处理以后，社员和个体农民打井安水车的积极性都提高了，到五月六日为止，连丰社带动互助组、个体户准备好了打两个井的木料和石料，爱国社也联合互助组和个体农户安上了三部水车，把七十五亩旱地变成了水浇地。
