　　Credit Cooperatives Should Actively Develop Deposit and Loan Business
　　Wang Jinnong
    The current task of credit cooperatives is to actively develop deposit and loan businesses, and to help members overcome difficulties in production and life in a timely manner through loans, so as to support agricultural production. Whether the credit union's loan business can be carried out smoothly depends first on whether the credit union can do a good job in attracting deposits. Only in this way can the credit union itself have sufficient funds to carry out loan business.
    However, many credit cooperatives have not paid attention to developing deposit business in the process of issuing spring plowing loans, and now they are unable to meet the needs of members' loans due to insufficient funds. Moreover, a small number of credit cooperatives have been forced to suspend business due to serious shortage of funds; members of the community are very dissatisfied with these credit cooperatives because the problems of production and life cannot be solved. They say that these credit cooperatives "only build the stage but do not perform the show."
    Credit cooperatives cannot rapidly develop deposit business mainly because credit cooperative staff have many incorrect views and practices on developing deposit business. Some credit cooperative staff only value large deposits and despise small deposits; they only value time deposits and despise demand deposits. They believe that small deposits and demand deposits "neither solve the problem nor are they troublesome," and that "chopping down big trees has firewood to burn," and "it is better to only look for wealthy households," and so on. These erroneous ideas show that some credit cooperative staff do not have a sufficient understanding of the fact that credit cooperatives are broad-based, mass-based, mutual-aid organizations in terms of funds. Of course, in order to effectively help the broad masses of farmers overcome difficulties in production and life, it is necessary for credit cooperatives to pay attention to absorbing large amounts and long-term deposits in carrying out deposit business, but it must be recognized that such deposits are not the main source of funds for credit cooperatives. Because, if credit cooperatives only focus on a few wealthy households when absorbing deposits, and neglect or are unwilling to absorb small and short-term deposits, they will inevitably confine the broad-based mass business activities to a narrow circle, and therefore it will be impossible to absorb a large amount of deposits. This practice must be opposed. Wanghuitun, Minzhong Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, has a total of 131 farm households. The credit cooperative initially only planned to mobilize five or six wealthy farmers to make deposits, and it was estimated that only 400 yuan could be absorbed. However, after the credit cooperative criticized the erroneous idea of only valuing large and long-term deposits and despising small and short-term deposits, and actively absorbed small and short-term deposits, the result was that 43 farm households deposited 976 yuan, more than double the amount of deposits that could be absorbed as originally expected. It can be seen that it is absolutely necessary to build the deposit business on a broad mass base.
    Some people also believe that at present, farmers all need loan assistance and have no money to deposit at all. Under this pretext, the staff of the credit cooperative does not actively try to open up sources of funds from various aspects, but simply relies on the support of the state bank, and some even use the method of forcing members to expand their shares to replenish the credit cooperative's revolving funds, which has aroused the opposition of the members. As a result, the business of these credit cooperatives still cannot be carried out. Generally speaking, farmers currently need production investment, and therefore there are more households that need loans, but this does not mean that there is no possibility of absorbing deposits at all. Because the economic situation of each farm household in the countryside is unbalanced, some households cannot invest all their funds in production, or invest in production at one time. As long as the propaganda and education work is done well, the credit cooperative can absorb their idle funds. Secondly, the objects of credit cooperatives' absorption of deposits are very broad. For example, family members of soldiers, family members of workers, and handicraftsmen in rural areas have funds that are temporarily not needed, and they can be mobilized to deposit these funds in credit cooperatives. In addition, striving to recover due and overdue loans is also an important aspect of replenishing funds. In fact, many farmers still have surplus money to deposit in credit cooperatives at present. Zhonglou Credit Cooperative in the fifth district of Jiaxiang County, Shandong Province, also experienced a shortage of funds and could not meet the loan requirements of its members at the beginning of spring plowing. However, thanks to the active efforts of the cooperative cadres to open up sources of funds, they absorbed more than 680 yuan of deposits in nine days and recovered 200 yuan of overdue loans, thereby ensuring the turnover of funds and meeting the requirements of loan households in a timely manner. It can be seen that the view that farmers have no money to deposit at present has no basis.
    However, the principle of voluntariness must be earnestly implemented when absorbing deposits. It is necessary to educate the members of the community through propaganda so that they can realize that only when everyone deposits money in the credit cooperative can the cooperative have sufficient funds, so that farmers in difficulty can get help. When mobilizing farmers to make deposits, it is necessary to adopt different working methods according to their specific ideological situation. Some credit cooperatives have adopted the methods of "delivering the principal and interest to the door upon maturity" and keeping secrets on their behalf for farmers who have concerns about "easy deposit and difficult withdrawal" and farmers who are "afraid of revealing wealth," which has dispelled their concerns. These practices are very good. In areas where conditions permit, credit cooperatives must sign deposit and loan contracts with local agricultural production cooperatives. Experience has proved that the signing of deposit and loan contracts not only enables credit cooperatives to obtain a regular source of funds, but also greatly strengthens the planning of the use of funds by agricultural production cooperatives. This is worth greatly promoting.
    According to the principle of loan division of labor determined at the National Rural Financial Work Conference this spring, credit cooperatives mainly handle short-term and small-amount general revolving loans. The loan objects should first support poor farmers, followed by production mutual aid and cooperation organizations and other working people in rural areas. In the past, some credit cooperatives had a tendency to exclude poor farmers and not take care of middle peasants in difficulty in loans, which should be corrected.
    Local agricultural banks are the business guidance organs of credit cooperatives, and therefore have the responsibility to strengthen the specific assistance to the deposit and loan business of credit cooperatives, and to make unified arrangements for the business plans of credit cooperatives, so as to better exert the role of credit cooperatives. For those credit cooperatives that have indeed made various efforts but still have difficulties in fund turnover, the Agricultural Bank should provide necessary loan support.

### 信用合作社应该积极开展存款放款业务

　　信用合作社应该积极开展存款放款业务
　　王金农
    信用合作社当前的任务就是要积极开展存、放款业务，通过贷款及时地帮助社员克服生产和生活上的困难，支持农业生产。信用社贷款业务能不能顺利地开展，首先要看信用社能不能做好吸收存款工作，只有这样，信用社本身才有开展贷款业务的充裕的资金。
    但是，有不少信用社在发放春耕贷款过程中没有注意开展存款业务，目前已因资金不足，不能满足社员贷款的需要。而且有少数信用社因资金严重不足，已经陷入停业状态；社员群众由于生产和生活上的困难问题得不到解决，对这些信用合作社很不满意，他们说这些信用社“光搭台子不唱戏”。
    信用社不能迅速开展存款业务，主要是因为信用社的工作人员对开展存款业务有许多不正确的看法和做法。有些信用社的工作人员只重大额存款，轻视小额存款；只重定期存款，轻视活期存款。他们认为小额存款和活期存款“既不解决问题，又麻烦”，认为“砍倒大树有柴烧”，“不如只找富裕户”等等。这些错误思想，说明了某些信用社的工作人员对于信用社是具有广泛的群众性的资金上的互助组织这一点认识不足。当然，信用社为了有效地帮助广大农民群众克服生产和生活上的困难，在开展存款业务中注意吸收数额大、期限长的存款，是需要的，但是必须认识到这种存款并不是信用社资金的主要来源。因为，如果信用社在吸收存款时，只把眼睛放在少数的富裕户身上，忽视或不愿吸收小额短期存款，就必然要把广阔的群众性的业务活动困缩在狭小的圈子里，因而也就不可能大量地吸收存款，这种做法是必须反对的。黑龙江省克山县民众村王会屯共有一百三十一户农民，信用社开始只计划动员五、六户富裕农民存款，预计只能吸收存款四百元；但是在这个信用社批判了只重大额和长期存款、轻视小额和短期存款的错误思想，积极吸收小额和短期存款以后，结果有四十三户农民存款九百七十六元，比原来预计能够吸收的存款增加了一倍还多。可见，把吸收存款业务建筑在广泛的群众性基础之上是绝对必要的。
    也有人认为：目前农民都需要贷款帮助，根本没有钱可存。在这种借口下，信用社的工作人员就不去积极设法从多方面开辟资金来源，而是单纯地依赖国家银行的支持，有的甚至用强迫社员扩充股金的办法来充实信用社的周转资金，以至遭到社员的反对。结果，这些信用社的业务还是不能开展。一般地说，农民在目前都需要生产投资，因而需要贷款的户比较多，但这并不等于说根本没有吸收存款的可能。因为在农村中各户农民的经济情况是不平衡的，有些户不能把全部资金都投入生产，或一次投入生产，只要做好宣传教育工作，信用社就可能把他们的闲置待用的资金吸收进来。其次，信用社吸收存款的对象是很广泛的，例如在农村的军人家属、工人家属以及手工业者有暂时用不着的款项，就可以动员他们把这些款项存到信用社里。另外，努力收回到期和逾期贷款，也是充裕资金的一个重要方面。事实上，有不少的农民在目前还是有余钱存到信用社里来的。山东嘉祥县五区中楼信用合作社，在春耕开始时也曾发生过资金短绌、不能满足社员贷款要求的现象，但是由于社干部积极设法开辟资金来源，在九天当中就吸收了六百八十多元的存款，还收回了二百元到期贷款，从而保证了资金的周转，及时地满足了贷款户的要求。可见认为目前农民根本无款可存的看法是没有任何根据的。
    但是在吸收存款时，必须切实贯彻自愿原则。要通过宣传教育使社员群众认识到只有大家都向信用社存款，才可以使社的资金充裕，从而使有困难的农民得到帮助。在动员农民存款时要针对他们具体思想情况，采取不同的工作方法。有些信用社对有“存入容易取时难”顾虑的农民和“怕露富”的农民采取“到期把本息送上门”和代为保守秘密的办法，解除了他们的顾虑，这些做法都是很好的。在有条件的地区，信用社必须和当地的农业生产合作社订立存贷合同。经验证明，订立存贷合同不仅使信用社可以得到经常的资金来源，而且还能在很大的程度上加强农业生产合作社使用资金的计划性。这是值得大大提倡的。
    根据今年春季全国农村金融工作会议确定的贷款分工原则，信用社主要办理期短、额小的一般性周转贷款，贷款对象首先应该扶助贫困农民，其次是生产互助合作组织和农村中的其他劳动群众。过去有些信用社在贷款中有排斥贫农和不照顾有困难的中农的偏向，这是应该纠正的。
    各地农业银行是信用合作社的业务指导机关，因此有责任加强对信用社存、放款业务的具体帮助，要把信用社的业务计划进行统一的安排，以便更好地发挥信用社的作用。对于那些确实经过了多方面的努力而在资金周转上仍然还有困难的信用合作社，农业银行是应当给予必要的贷款支持的。
