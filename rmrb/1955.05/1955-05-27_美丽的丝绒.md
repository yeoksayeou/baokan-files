　　In Nanxiang Town, Jiading County, Jiangsu Province, there is a "Jin Xing Silk Fabric Printing Factory" that produces velvet entirely by hand.

　　The velvet produced by this factory is brightly colored and dazzling, making it one of the most precious types of silk. It is sold to countries such as the Soviet Union and Hungary, and is deeply loved by international friends. Women in these countries like to buy this beautiful velvet to make skirts and dresses. In China, Uyghur girls especially like to make skirts out of velvet, wearing them to sing and dance during festivals.

　　Since the "Jin Xing Silk Fabric Printing Factory" started producing velvet in August 1954, the quality and quantity of its products have improved. The factory originally produced two rolls of velvet per machine per day, but now it can produce more than three rolls. The factory's monthly velvet production has increased from sixty rolls to nearly six hundred rolls. Wu Yanji, an old worker in the dye room, used to mix dyes every few days, which was wasteful and prone to fading. Later, he changed to mixing them once a day, which not only saved dye but also made the colors brighter. The workers who overlay the pattern on the printing table used to take a long time to overlay the printing plates, and they had to overlay them many times, which made the patterns blurry. Now, because they frequently wash the printing plates, the printed patterns are very clear. In April of this year, Tang Boqing and other hair-arranging workers went to Shanghai to learn advanced hair-arranging techniques. They changed the original method of two workers pulling the velvet to arrange the hair to using a table to arrange the hair, making the velvet's pile even and beautiful. In order to increase the variety of velvet patterns, Xue Jianqing, a pattern-carving worker, is carving seven new printing plates according to the patterns designed by the Shanghai Silk Company, preparing to put them into production.

　　In 1954, Soviet experts who came to China, textile industry models from Poland and Bulgaria, and Japanese painters and musicians all visited this factory. Soviet experts offered many suggestions to the workers on how to improve product quality. Originally, the washing room used manual water lifting, and the water was not changed frequently, which affected the color of the velvet. After the Soviet experts pointed this out, motor-driven water pumping equipment was adopted, allowing the water to be changed frequently, reducing the workers' physical labor and ensuring the color and luster of the velvet.

　　In the past nine months, the workers of the "Jin Xing Silk Fabric Printing Factory" have produced more than 3,700 rolls of "Rotten Pulp Printed Georgette Velvet" and more than 1,200 rolls of "Burn-out Velvet." The "Rotten Pulp Printed Georgette Velvet" alone can earn the country 3,780 tons of steel.

### 美丽的丝绒

　　美丽的丝绒
　　朱敬禹
    在江苏嘉定县南翔镇，有一个完全用手工印制丝绒的“金星绸布印花厂”。
    这个厂生产的丝绒色彩鲜艳夺目，是丝绸中最名贵的一种。它远销苏联和匈牙利等国家，深受国际友人的喜爱。这些国家的妇女，都喜欢购买这种美丽的丝绒做裙子和衣衫。在国内，维吾尔族的姑娘们特别喜欢拿丝绒做成裙子，穿着它在节日里唱歌、跳舞。
    “金星绸布印花厂”自一九五四年八月开始生产丝绒以来，产品的质量、数量都有提高。这个厂原来每天每台生产两匹丝绒，现在可以生产三匹以上。全厂丝绒的月产量已经从六十匹增加到近六百匹。染料间老工人吴岩记原先几天里调拌一次颜料，耗费大，还容易褪色，后来改成一天调拌一次，不仅节约颜料，而且色彩鲜明。台板套印工人原来套印花板，需用时间长，而且要套的次数多，花纹还显得模糊，现在由于经常洗涤印花板，印出的花纹、图案都十分清晰。今年四月里，排毛工人唐伯清等去上海学习了排毛的先进经验，把原来两个工人拉住丝绒排毛的办法改成台板排毛，把丝绒的毛头顺在一边，既均匀，又美观。为了增加丝绒的花种，刻花工人薛剑青按照上海丝绸公司设计的花样，正在刻制七种新的印花板，准备投入生产。
    一九五四年，来我国的苏联专家和波兰、保加利亚的纺织工业模范以及日本的画家、音乐家都曾经到这个厂参观过。苏联专家对工人们如何提高产品质量提出了不少改进的意见。原来，如洗汰间是用人工提水的，水不常换，影响了丝绒的色彩，经苏联专家指出以后，改用了马达抽水设备，用水能经常调换，减轻了工人的体力劳动，也保证了丝绒的颜色、光彩。
    九个多月来，“金星绸布印花厂”工人已经生产了三千七百多匹“烂浆印乔其丝绒”和一千二百多匹“烂花丝绒”。仅“烂浆印乔其丝绒”一项就可以给国家换回三千七百八十吨钢材。
