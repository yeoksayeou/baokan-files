Shandong Salt Production Sees a Bumper Harvest

    Shandong's salt production has achieved a bumper harvest this year.

    All salt workers of the state-owned Shandong Salt Company overfulfilled the state plan seven days ahead of schedule in April. Now, the salt workers are striving to complete the annual target of increasing the production of edible salt and industrial salt by 180,000 dan.

    The Yangjiaogou Longche Salt Industry Production Cooperative in Shandong has also achieved a bumper harvest. This cooperative is one of the larger salt industry production cooperatives in Shandong Province, with a total of 2,114 mu of salt fields. In April this year, it produced 18,159 dan of edible salt, of which 15,059 dan were first-class salt, setting a new record for salt quality.

    In the state-owned Shandong Salt Company's salt fields, which are experiencing a bumper harvest, white piles of salt are everywhere, showcasing a scene of abundance.

    The Longche Salt Industry Production Cooperative actively expanded its salt fields this year and added many machines and equipment. This is a pump recently added by the cooperative.

    In order to adapt to the development of salt production and improve the working conditions of workers, Qingdao Zhonggang Wharf has begun to use machines to load salt.
