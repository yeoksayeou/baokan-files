The Road to Saving in Architectural Design is Broad
Chen Jiang, Director of the Design Office of the Guangxi Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau

Currently, construction departments in various regions are opposing waste, which is absolutely correct. I believe that to oppose waste in construction, one should start with design work. Only by overcoming formalism in design can waste be effectively curbed. Therefore, I have a few suggestions for practicing thrift in architectural design, which I offer for everyone's reference:

With the development of national economic construction, some old cities are being renovated and expanded; new industrial cities are also constantly emerging. Therefore, the quality of urban planning has a significant impact. Currently, some urban planning drafts in implementation have the shortcomings of excessive land occupation and overly small blocks. Some even exceed the allowable land use by one or two times or more; some blocks are as small as one or two hectares. This will increase investment and management costs for road paving, water and sewage pipelines, and other municipal construction, which is uneconomical. At the same time, small blocks with frequent traffic on all sides make it difficult for residents to get a quiet rest environment, and the increase in intersections makes traffic accidents more likely. It is necessary to limit single-story buildings, stipulate the number of floors for buildings, strictly control the land area for construction units, close unnecessary roads, merge small blocks, or use other effective methods to appropriately reduce urban land area and expand block size. More seriously, some cities have no planning at all, with houses being built randomly and scattered. If rational planning is desired in the future, some newly built houses will inevitably be demolished. Furthermore, some urban plans do not have rational zoning, with factories built in residential areas. In the future, to avoid the impact of factory smoke, dust, ash, odor, noise, etc. on residents, either the factory moves or the residents move, resulting in huge losses. The rational distribution of public buildings is closely related to urban planning. If halls, dining rooms, nurseries, water towers, etc. can be uniformly planned and rationally distributed, it can not only save investment but also improve efficiency. However, many government agencies, factories, and schools are now doing their own thing, which is a huge waste. Taking water towers as an example, Nanning City has built many small water towers in the past two or three years. Including well-drilling projects and pumping equipment, each water tower costs at least four or five thousand yuan, and up to tens of thousands of yuan, plus the long-term expenditure of management fees. This is not only wasteful, but also damages the city's aesthetics with water towers standing everywhere.

When designing each building, the number of floors, size, span, and height of each floor also have a significant impact on economic waste or savings. Four-story buildings are the most economical, because buildings with five or more floors generally require elevators, increasing investment; buildings with six or seven or more floors require increased structural area, which is also uneconomical. Therefore, four-story buildings should be designed as much as possible. In addition, comparing small buildings of two or three hundred square meters with large buildings of two or three thousand square meters, the types and quality of the structures are the same, but the average cost per square meter is different. Large buildings can save 10% to 20% compared to small buildings. Therefore, combining small buildings into large buildings can not only save costs, but also enhance the beauty of the city, save urban land, and increase green space. However, some construction units are very interested in small residences, which is a huge waste. In terms of building span and height, according to our experience, each meter increase in span can reduce costs by about 1%, and each 10% reduction in height can reduce costs by about 5%. The span of dormitories is generally suitable at twelve to fourteen meters. The net height of various buildings should be strictly controlled, and the overall height of the building can also be reduced by reducing the platform height and reducing beam height, so as to save costs. At the same time, it is necessary to minimize traffic area and wall area, and increase usable area. In addition, it is also very important to pay attention to the calculation of other related technical and economic indicators, so that buildings can be as economical and rational as possible. But unfortunately, many of our construction engineers are not very interested in these technical and economic indicators and related calculations, but are immersed in the "facade," "style," "balance," "proportion," "lines," and other so-called "beauty" of architecture. This is wrong.

There is also a strange phenomenon in construction, which is the prevalence of walls. In cities such as Wuhan and Nanning, the trend of building walls is very strong. Each meter of brick wall costs ten to thirty yuan. If it is "beautified" and "decorated," the cost will be even higher. The problem is not just waste. Its widespread appearance is also extremely inconsistent with our people's cities today. In the old society, it was used for theft prevention; the reactionary ruling class used it to defend against the people. If it is for the convenience of management, is it not more economical, beautiful, and practical to set up temporary bamboo and wood fences and plant Chinese holly, roses, or other flowers and trees to create green hedges? Of course, important warehouses and factories, or some units with special needs, need to build walls, but it is more harmful than beneficial to build brick walls for all kinds of buildings.

A good structural engineer should not only be able to use local materials and give full play to the effectiveness of materials, but also be good at helping material production departments improve the specifications and quality of materials according to the needs of the project, which can save the country a lot of money. During the construction of the Harbin Flax Factory, Soviet experts helped the brick factory find ways to fire high-grade bricks, which not only met the needs of the factory construction, but was also very economical. For example, steel-reinforced brick beams with spans of three to six meters reduce costs by 10% to 26% compared to steel-reinforced concrete beams with the same span, and can save templates and a considerable amount of cement. If the brick factory can supply specially made bricks of grade 200 or higher (with concave and convex surfaces to increase the joint surface), the section of this steel-reinforced brick beam can be reduced, and it can also be used for buildings with larger spans. For example, someone suggested that roof decking felt should not be used on the roofs of southern tile houses, so that three yuan can be saved per square meter of building area. We have used ordinary tiles on roofs with spans of eleven or twelve meters without decking felt, and the roof slope was changed to 30 degrees; but if the current tiles can be improved to make their water resistance better, they can also be used on roofs with larger spans, or the rafters can be waterproofed and anti-corrosion treated to extend the life of the roof. Isn't this also very good! For example, in design, according to the load-bearing pressure of the walls and the ease of construction in various parts of the house, using various grades of bricks in combination is better than using only one grade of bricks regardless of actual needs! Why are we turning a blind eye to this fairly common uneconomical and unreasonable thing! These are not only matters for the materials department, but also issues that design engineers should first pay attention to solving. Architects, in general civil buildings, have a special responsibility to save as much as possible steel, cement, wood, and other materials that are currently in short supply, in order to support the needs of industrial construction. To this end, I believe that general warehouses, halls, dining rooms, and certain production plants should all be built with double-curvature brick arches in areas not affected by earthquakes. The construction of double-curvature brick arches has been adopted by the Ministry of Light Industry and other departments, and the effect has been proven to be very good. It is both economical and durable, and can save a large amount of steel, cement, and wood.

In short, there are many ways to save in construction. On the premise of ensuring the quality of construction, in the design process, if architects, structural engineers, and all design workers can cooperate closely, think of more ways, and make economic comparisons of various programs, a lot of waste can be avoided, and a lot of money can be saved for the country! For example, in terms of the overall layout, according to the comparison of the two designs of the overall layout of the Guangxi Sugar Factory living area, the second design changed from a scattered layout to a centralized layout, changed the two-story building to a three-story building, and increased the width of the building. As a result, the length of the road was reduced by 33.2%, from the original 900 meters farthest from the production plant to 620 meters, while maintaining a sanitary protection zone of 300 meters; water and electricity pipelines and construction costs were significantly reduced; 18,000 cubic meters of earthwork were reduced; the number of buildings was reduced by 56.5%, the land area was reduced by 18.6%, the occupied area was reduced by 31%; and the site utilization factor increased from the original 15% to 20%. For example, in a single building, the design of the Guangxi Provincial Trade Company and Food Company office building combined the buildings originally planned as two into a building with a construction area of more than 2,700 square meters. The cost per square meter was only 56.4 yuan (brick and wood structure, partial terrazzo and reinforced concrete, complete water and electricity sanitation equipment), which was more than 10% lower than the cost of dividing it into two buildings, and the land area was also reduced by one-third. But if the width of the house can be increased and some unnecessary balconies can be removed, the cost can be reduced by another 2% or more. This proves that the road to saving in design is broad, and our architectural designers must strive to reduce project costs!

　　在建筑设计中实行节约的道路是宽广的
　　广西省建筑工程局设计室主任　陈江
    目前，各地建筑部门正反对浪费，这是十分正确的。我认为，反对建筑中的浪费，应首先从设计工作入手，只有克服设计中的形式主义倾向，才能有效地克服浪费现象。为此，我对于建筑设计中厉行节约有几点意见，提出来供大家参考：
    随着国家经济建设的发展，有的旧城市正在改建、扩大；新的工业城市也不断出现。因此，城市规划工作的好坏影响是很大的。目前，有些城市的规划草案实施中，存在着占地过大和街坊过小的缺点，有的竟超过容许用地的一两倍甚至更多；有的每一街坊小得只一、二公顷。这样，将使道路铺设、上下水管道及其他市政建设投资和管理费用增加，是不经济的。同时，街坊过小，四面车马往来频繁，使居民得不到安静的休息环境，而且交叉路口增多，容易发生交通事故。限制平房建筑，规定房屋的层数，严格控制兴建单位的用地面积，封闭不必要的道路，合并小街坊，或用其他有效办法，适当缩小城市用地面积和扩大街坊范围，是很必要的。更严重的是有的城市根本就没有规划，房屋到处乱盖，星散零乱，将来如想合理规划时，免不了有些新建房屋要被拆除。再如有的城市规划没有合理的分区，工厂建在居住区内，以后为了要免除工厂的烟、糠、灰尘、臭气、噪音等对居民的影响，不是工厂搬家就是居民搬家，损失都是巨大的。公共建筑的合理分布，同城市规划有密切关系。像礼堂、饭厅、托儿所、水塔等，如能作统一的规划、合理的分布，不但可以节约投资，而且也可提高使用效率。但是，现在许多机关、工厂、学校都各搞一套，这种浪费是很大的。以水塔为例，如南宁市两三年来就建了不少小水塔，包括打井工程和抽水设备在内，每一水塔费用少则四、五千元，多则数万元，还有管理费用的长期支出；这样不只是浪费，而且到处水塔林立，也损害了城市的美观。
    在进行每幢房屋设计时，它的层数多少、体积大小、跨度宽窄和每层的高度，对经济上的浪费或是节约也有很大影响。楼房的层数以四层为最经济，因为五层以上一般要设电梯，投资增大；六、七层以上就要增加结构面积，也不经济。因此应该尽可能多设计四层楼房。另外，拿二、三百平方公尺的小幢建筑和二、三千平方公尺的大幢建筑比较，其结构种类质量相同，但每平方公尺的平均造价却不同，大幢的可比小幢的节约百分之十至二十。因此，把小幢建筑组合成大幢建筑不但可以节约造价，而且还能够增加市容美观、节约城市用地和增加绿化空地。但是有些兴建单位，对小住宅很感兴趣，实在是很大的浪费。在房屋的跨度和高度方面，根据我们的经验，跨度每增宽一公尺可降低造价约百分之一，高度每减低十分之一可降低造价约百分之五。宿舍的跨度一般以十二至十四公尺为合适。各种房屋净空高度，应加以严格控制，同时还可从减低地台高度和减小梁高等方法来使房屋总高度减低，以便节约。同时要尽可能减少交通面积和墙身面积，增加使用面积。此外，重视对其他有关技术经济指标的计算，使建筑物尽可能达到节约和合理，也是十分重要的。但可惜我们有很多建筑工程师们，对这些技术经济指标和有关的计算数字兴趣不大，却沉迷在建筑的“立面”、“风格”、
  “权衡”、“比例”、“线条”等等所谓“美”的大海中。这是错误的。
    在建筑中还有一种奇怪的现象，即围墙多。在武汉、南宁等城市，建筑围墙的风气很盛。每公尺的砖砌围墙，造价在十至三十元，如果把它再“美化”“装饰”一番，花费就更多。问题不只是浪费，它的普遍出现，和我们今天的人民城市也是极不相称的，在旧社会它是被用来防盗的；反动统治阶级则用它来防御人民。如果是为了方便管理的话，设置临时的竹木栏杆，种上冬青、蔷薇或其它花木，造成绿篱，不是既经济、美观又实用吗？当然，重要的仓库和工厂，或某些有特殊需要的单位，是需要建筑围墙的，但不管什么建筑物都搞上砖砌围墙就有损无益了。
      一个好的结构工程师，应该是不但能就地取材，很好地发挥材料的效能，而且善于帮助材料生产部门，根据工程的需要来改进材料的规格和质量，这可为国家节省很多钱。在哈尔滨亚麻厂的建设过程中，苏联专家帮助砖厂设法烧制高标号的砖，不但满足了建厂的需要，而且很经济。如六公尺至三公尺跨度的钢筋砖梁，较同跨度的钢筋混凝土梁要降低造价百分之十至二十六，并且可节约模板和相当数量的水泥。砖厂如能供给二百号以上的特制砖（为了增加接面要有凹凸面），这种钢筋砖梁的断面尚可减小，跨度再大一点的建筑也可应用。又如有人建议，在南方平瓦屋面不用望板油毛毡，这样每平方公尺的建筑面积就可节约三元。我们曾在十一、二公尺跨度的屋面不用望板油毛毡，而把屋面斜度改为三十度，盖普通平瓦一样可用；但如能改良现用平瓦，使其隔水效能再好一点，更大跨度的屋面也可应用，或把瓦桁瓦桷加以防水防腐处理，使屋面的寿命延长，不是也很好吗！又如，在设计时，根据房屋各处墙身的荷重受压和便于施工的情况，采用各种不同标号的砖配合使用，不是比不根据实际需要一律用一种标号的砖更好吗！为什么我们对这种相当普遍地存在的不经济不合理的事情熟视无睹呢！以上这些，不只是材料部门的事，也是设计工程师们首先应该注意解决的问题。建筑师在一般民用建筑上，特别有责任尽可能地节约目前尚感供应不足的钢筋、水泥、木材等，以支援工业建设的需要。为此，我认为一般的仓库、礼堂、饭厅以及某些生产厂房，在不受地震影响的地区，都应采用双曲砖拱来建造。双曲砖拱的建筑，经轻工业部等部门采用，证明效果很好，既经济耐用，又可节约大量的钢筋、水泥和木材。
    总之，在建筑方面节约的门路是很多的。在保证建筑质量的条件下，在设计过程中，建筑师、结构工程师和全体设计工作者们，如果大家能够通力合作，多想办法，作多种方案的经济比较，就可以避免很多的浪费，为国家节约不少的钱！例如：在总平面布置上，根据广西糖厂生活区总平面布置两次设计的比较，第二次由分散布置改为集中布置，将二层建筑改为三层建筑，并加大房屋宽度，结果：道路长距减少百分之三十三点二，由原来离生产厂房最远九百公尺减至六百二十公尺，同样保持有三百公尺的卫生防护地带；水电管线和建筑费用显著减少；减少土方一万八千立方公尺；房屋幢数减少百分之五十六点五，用地面积减少百分之十八点六，占地面积减少百分之三十一；场地使用系数由原来的百分之十五增至百分之二十。又如在单幢建筑上，广西省贸易公司和食品公司办公楼的设计，将原来计划分为两幢的建筑，组合为一幢建筑面积二千七百多平方公尺的楼房，每平方公尺的造价仅为五十六元四角（砖木结构，部分水磨石及钢筋混凝土，水电卫生设备齐全），比分为二幢建筑降低造价百分之十以上，用地面积也减少三分之一。但如果能将房屋宽度加大一些，取消部分不必要的阳台等，则还可以再降低造价百分之二以上。这证明，在设计中实行节约的道路是宽广的，我们建筑设计者要努力为降低工程造价而奋斗！
