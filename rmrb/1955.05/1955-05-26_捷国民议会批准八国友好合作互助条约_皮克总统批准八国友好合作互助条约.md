Široký said that the Czechoslovak government, together with the Soviet Union and all friendly countries, will strive for peace and friendship among all nations. We will continue to support all peace initiatives from whatever source with all our strength. At the same time, we will do our utmost to ensure that we are fully prepared to deal with any aggression, so that we can, together with the Soviet Union and other people's democracies, repel any attack. Referring to the so-called neutralization nonsense recently issued by the imperialists to the people's democracies, including Czechoslovakia, Široký said: "To those official spokespersons of Western countries who seem to have no respect for national sovereignty and national rights, our answer is: The Czechoslovak people have definitively resolved the issue of their national sovereignty and national freedom, and they absolutely do not want to suffer again the freedom of exploitation, the rule of the strong over the weak, nor do they want to see the proud banner of their national and national independence trampled upon."

　　During the discussion, leaders of various democratic parties and mass organizations spoke, fully agreeing with the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance of Eight Countries.
