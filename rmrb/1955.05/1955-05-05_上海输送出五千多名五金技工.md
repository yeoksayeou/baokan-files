Shanghai has transferred more than 5,500 hardware technicians in the past nine months to support key construction projects. After studying the general task of the state during the transition period, the broad masses of workers in Shanghai regard supporting key construction as an extremely honorable thing. Since 1954, a total of 20,000 workers have signed up to participate in key construction projects, and 5,559 have been approved according to plan. Fifty percent of these technicians are grade five to eight workers, and Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members account for more than 35 percent. Many are also model workers, trade union cadres, and workshop directors, who are the backbone and active elements in production. Among the first seven technicians to go to the Datong Iron Factory, three were production team leaders and one was an advanced worker in Shanghai. Many technicians who participated in the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and other units have been promoted to production team leaders, section chiefs, and workshop managers due to their active work. Some have also been selected to study abroad.

The relevant units in Shanghai generally attach great importance to transferring technicians to support key construction. Many factories actively exploit their technical potential and mobilize their best technicians to participate in key construction under the principle of "transferring people without reducing production." The Tilanqiao and Jiangning District Committees of the Chinese Communist Party formulated transfer plans based on the technical workers and factory production in their respective districts, and transferred a total of more than 1,300 technicians in three batches. Some factories have begun to actively train new technicians after transferring technical workers to meet new transfer tasks.

　　上海输送出五千多名五金技工
    上海市在过去的九个月中，已经先后输送出五千五百多名五金技术工人，支援重点建设工程。上海广大工人学习过国家过渡时期的总任务以后，都把支援重点建设作为无比光荣的事情。从一九五四年起，先后报名参加重点建设工作的工人共有二万名，根据计划批准的已有五千五百五十九名。这些技术工人中百分之五十是五级到八级工，共产党员和青年团员占百分之三十五以上，有很多还是劳动模范、工会干部和车间主任等生产上的骨干分子和积极分子。第一批到大同铁工厂的七名技工中，就有三名是生产小组长，一名是上海市的先进工作者。到第一汽车制造厂等单位参加建设的技工，不少人由于工作积极，已被提拔为生产小组长、工段长和车间管理人员，有的并已被选拔出国学习。
    上海市各有关单位对抽调技工支援重点建设一般都很重视。许多工厂积极发挥技术潜力，在“调人不减产”的原则下，动员本厂最优秀的技术工人去参加重点建设。中共提篮桥、江宁两区区委，根据本区技术工人和工厂生产的情况制定抽调方案，三批共输送技工一千三百多名。有些工厂在调出技术工人以后，已经开始积极培养新技工，迎接新的输送任务。
