　　Automobile Drove into the Mountain Gully

To the Editor:

　　The Daijiang District of Huanren County, Liaoning Province, was once the area where General Yang Jingyu led the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla forces. It is more than 140 li away from the county seat, and the transportation is very inconvenient. In the area of ​​Nuanhezi Village and Muyuzi Village, there are more than 20 li of dangerous mountain roads and muddy road sections. Therefore, the situation of manure not being able to be delivered to the fields and crops not being able to be transported back often occurs; during the autumn harvest, farmers have to thresh in the fields until after the ground freezes before they can transport the grain back. The difficulties encountered by the supply and marketing cooperatives are even greater. They often combine two carts and six animals into one cart to pull goods to Daijiang, and sometimes they still encounter danger. People riding bicycles sometimes have to carry their bikes; district and village cadres often cannot arrive on time for meetings in the county. Because of the inconvenient transportation, it brings many difficulties to the masses in production and life.

　　In 1954, the government decided to build a highway from Huanren to Daijiang, to allow cars to pass, and decided to construct it during the flood season. Through the efforts of the road construction workers and the support of the farmers along the route, the highway was quickly built; the muddy land in the Nuanhezi Village area has been filled with sand and gravel; the most difficult section of the Menzhuanzi Ridge has also been widened, which makes the entire route unimpeded.

　　On the day of the opening ceremony, the masses along the route were jubilant. When the car with colorful balls hanging on it drove to Daijiang, the car was immediately surrounded by the crowd. Grandma Jiang, who was in her fifties, came from a very far place to see the car, and cheers rang out. Grandma Jiang said with emotion: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's leadership, how could our small mountain gully have a car in our lifetime!"

　　Since the highway was built and cars have been running in the Daijiang District, the time to go to Huanren has been reduced from two days to four hours; the commodity transportation surcharge of the supply and marketing cooperatives has been reduced, and the turnover has also greatly increased. In the winter of 1954, the villages needed kerosene, and the cooperative used a phone call to transport more than ten barrels from the county by car. The masses said: Now we can buy anything!

　　The arrival of cars in the mountain gullies has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm and patriotism of the people in the mountainous areas. They expressed that they would respond to the care of the Party and the government for the people in the mountainous areas with practical actions. In the winter of 1954, the masses in the Daijiang District actively paid public grain and sold surplus grain, completing the transportation task of public grain ahead of schedule, and also sold more than 200,000 jin more surplus grain than in 1953. This year, they have also expanded the area of ​​paddy fields by more than 3,000 mu and purchased many fertilizer powders; recently, cars have also transported the first batch of new-style animal-powered farm tools, which have prepared conditions for winning greater harvests.

　　The farmers walking on the wide highway call this highway "the road to production" and "the road to building socialism." Indeed, after the highway was opened to traffic, it added new content to the production and life of the people in the mountainous areas and brought much happiness, thus strengthening the masses' confidence in building socialism.

　　汽车开进了山沟编辑同志：
    辽宁省桓仁县的黛江区，曾是杨靖宇将军率领抗日游击部队活动过的地区。这里，距县城有一百四十多里，交通很不方便。在暖河子村、木盂子村一带，还有二十多里的山岭险道和翻浆路段。因此，经常发生粪送不下地、庄稼运不回来的情况；秋收时，农民只好在地里打场，直到上冻以后才把粮食运回来。供销合作社碰到的困难那就更多了，他们往往把两套车六匹牲口并在一套车上往黛江拉货，有时仍然要出危险。骑自行车的人有时也得把车子扛起来走；区村干部到县开会往往不能按时到达。因为交通不便，给群众在生产上和生活上带来很多的困难。
    一九五四年政府决定从桓仁到黛江修一条公路，要通行汽车，并决定在汛期施工。经过筑路工人的努力，及沿线农民的支援，公路很快筑成了；暖河子村一带的翻浆烂泥地已经用沙石填平了；最难走的门转子岭一段也展宽了，这就使整个路线畅通无阻。
    在举行通车典礼的那天，沿线群众欢欣鼓舞。当悬挂彩球的汽车开到黛江的时候，汽车马上被人群围住。五十多岁的姜老大娘特地从很远的地方赶来看汽车，欢呼声响成一片。姜老大娘感动地说：“要不是毛主席的领导，咱们这个小山沟哪辈子能来汽车！”
    黛江区自从修好公路行驶汽车以后，到桓仁去的时间已由两天缩短到四小时；供销合作社的商品运输附加费降低了，营业额也大大增加了。一九五四年冬天，乡村需要煤油，社里一个电话就用汽车从县里运来了十多桶。群众说：现在什么东西都能买到了！
    汽车开进了山沟，大大地鼓舞了山区人民的生产热情和爱国热情，他们表示用实际行动来回答党和政府对山区人民的关怀。一九五四年冬黛江区的群众积极缴纳公粮卖余粮，提前完成了公粮的运送任务，并且还比一九五三年多卖了二十多万斤余粮。今年又扩大了水田面积三千多亩，购入了许多肥田粉；最近，汽车又运来了第一批新式畜力农具，这些都为争取更大的丰收准备了条件。
    行走在宽敞的公路上的农民群众称呼这条公路是：“生产的路”，“建设社会主义的路”。的确，公路通车以后，给山区人民的生产和生活上增添了新的内容，带来了许多幸福，因而更加坚定了群众建设社会主义的信心。　杜长金　苏奋
