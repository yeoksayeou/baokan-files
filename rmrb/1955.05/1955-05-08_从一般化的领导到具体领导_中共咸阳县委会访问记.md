    From Generalized Leadership to Specific Leadership
        — A Visit to the CCP Xianyang County Committee
    Chen Jun Ai Fang
    The spring plowing production movement in Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, has achieved relatively significant results. The reporters visited the CCP Xianyang County Committee. Deputy Secretary of the County Committee Xu Tingfang, County Mayor Yin Ruizhen, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the County Committee Mi Zhenmin, and Minister of Production Cooperation Department Su Yaoxian collectively answered the questions raised by the reporters. Their answers indicated that the County Committee had begun to overcome the generalized leadership style and strengthened the specific leadership of agricultural production. The following is the question and answer between the reporters and them.
    Question: How were the achievements of this year's spring plowing production achieved in the county?
    Answer: The reason why this year's spring plowing production movement can make achievements is due to three aspects: First, we resolutely implemented the policy of rectifying and consolidating existing agricultural production cooperatives around production. In the four aspects of spring plowing production, namely weeding wheat, collecting fertilizer, ensuring the completion of the planting area of cotton and oil crops according to the national plan, and eliminating pests, the agricultural production cooperatives took the lead in mobilizing, driving and influencing the vast number of mutual aid groups and individual farmers, creating a mass movement. The County Committee also slowed down the original plan to develop agricultural production cooperatives during the spring plowing period, focusing on leading production, rectifying and consolidating existing cooperatives, stabilizing the production sentiment of cooperative members, and reversing the chaotic phenomenon in production. All 113 agricultural production cooperatives in the county have formulated and revised the annual production plan and spring plowing production plan, and promoted the development of mutual aid groups, and rectified 724 mutual aid groups (statistics from five districts), and developed 143 mutual aid groups. Now there are 701 permanent mutual aid groups and 1,795 temporary mutual aid groups in the county. The organized farmers have reached 69% of the total number of farmers in the county. This has created favorable conditions for carrying out spring plowing production.
    Secondly, in the spring plowing, the policies of fixed production, fixed purchase and fixed sales were widely publicized, so that farmers further realized the benefits of the unified purchase and sales policy and the consistency of national interests and farmers' interests, eliminated farmers' concerns about the requisition and purchase work, and improved farmers' production enthusiasm. The agricultural production cooperatives have generally revised this year's production plan, generally increased the planned yield per unit area, and formulated specific measures to ensure increased production.
    Thirdly, in leading the spring plowing production, the County Committee changed the generalized leadership method of only issuing notices and calls in the past, investigated the situation of spring plowing production this year, and according to the instructions of the higher authorities and the situation below, the County Committee proposed four main links in spring plowing: weeding wheat, carrying out fertilizer collection movement, ensuring the completion of the national plan for planting cotton and oil crops, and resolutely eliminating pests and preventing late frost. Then, a meeting of district and township cadres was held for discussion, repeatedly emphasizing the idea of production first. After the work was deployed, the members of the County Committee were assigned to each district to conduct specific leadership, report back to the county regularly, conduct inspections, discover problems, conduct research, exchange experiences, and carry out spring plowing production movement around the four main links.
    Question: Can you focus on how the County Committee changed the generalized leadership style?
    Answer: Before leading the spring plowing production this year, the County Committee examined the past leadership ideas and realized that in the spring plowing movement over the years, the form was bustling, but the false phenomenon was very serious, whether it was the sowing plan or the pest control movement. Last year, the county's agricultural production plan was not completed. This is a painful lesson. In terms of leadership thinking, although the importance of production was often emphasized in the past, it was always believed that farmers would engage in production themselves, and it would not cause a big mess if they relaxed a little. Whenever other tasks came, they often squeezed out production work, causing production to fall into a state of spontaneity to varying degrees. And the County Committee itself did not conduct serious research on the knowledge and laws of agricultural production, and lacked investigation and research on the agricultural production situation in the county. This is a question of thinking. After the County Committee's inspection, these ideas were criticized, and further specific measures were taken to study the production work from March to May, and the important production activities were arranged: from mid-February to mid-March, pulling soil, delivering manure, weeding, and turning the soil; from mid-March to mid-April, fertilizing, plowing the reserved cotton fields, preventing insects, preventing frost, and preparing for seed selection and sowing; from mid-April to mid-May, vigorously preventing insects and preparing for summer harvest. Then, other aspects of work were inserted according to the tightness of production activities, and a phased work plan for the county was formulated. Such overall arrangements can indeed ensure that production is the center, and make all other aspects of work revolve around production and serve production; fundamentally overcome the shortcomings of leadership lagging behind the needs of agricultural production, grasp the most important farm work in each period according to the agricultural season, and help farmers arrange agricultural production.
    Question: How does the County Committee help farmers arrange agricultural production? Can you use an example to illustrate it?
    Answer: In the past, the County Committee also lacked understanding of the necessity of helping farmers arrange production work, thinking that farmers would not arrange their own production? In fact, we have not seen many new situations and new problems in agricultural production, and farmers are not accustomed to these new situations and new problems. For example, last winter, due to the heavy rural work (requisition and purchase work, conscription of supplementary soldiers, etc.), coupled with excessive winter snow, some cotton fields were not turned over, fertilizers were not delivered to the fields, and fertilizer accumulation work was not done well, etc. This year, when the spring started, the work was crowded together, and it was very difficult to arrange. Most of the newly built agricultural production cooperatives lack the experience of leading collective production. If the leadership does not see these new situations and does not help farmers arrange production according to different situations, it cannot actively lead the masses to overcome difficulties and carry out spring plowing production. The County Committee emphasized this issue to all cadres in the county, requiring cadres at all levels to strengthen specific leadership of production work, give play to the role of mutual aid and cooperation network, strengthen technical guidance, and change the past situation of only relying on meetings, mobilization, and talking without action. The process of Xiaoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liangsi Ferry, Weibin Township, carrying out spring plowing production can illustrate the importance of helping farmers arrange production work.
    Xiaoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liangsi Ferry had a good production last year and had a great influence. Last winter, it expanded to 143 households. Organizing production has become a more complex task. New problems appeared after the beginning of spring this year. On the one hand, there was a lot of work in the cooperative, and on the other hand, the cooperative members were idle and had nothing to do. The phenomena of gambling and going to the county to watch operas became more common. After the manure delivery started, ten carts were used to deliver manure every day, but no one knew how much manure the whole cooperative had and how many days it would take to deliver it. The cadre sent by the Production Cooperation Department of the County Committee discovered this situation and led the Liangsi Ferry Branch to discuss how to strengthen the leadership of spring plowing production, and held a symposium of cooperative directors and production team leaders to arrange farm work. It was found at the meeting that there were still more than 400 mu of spring land that had not been delivered manure. At the same time, many farm work such as turning the land, weeding, finely selecting cotton seeds, land processing, and repairing ditches had to be carried out, but the livestock power was insufficient and the manure could not be delivered to all the land, and there were still 300 mu of land that had not been winter plowing; manure delivery and land turning could not be taken care of at the same time. At the symposium, after discussion, manure had to be delivered, land had to be turned, and wheat fields had to be weeded. The cooperative cadres initially proposed to apply for agricultural loans, at least to buy another 20 cattle to allocate. Later, after calculating the labor and livestock power, under the conditions of abundant labor, it was decided to use manpower to deliver manure to nearby land and private land, mobilize cooperative members to turn the land with shovels, and mobilize all the women in the cooperative to weed the land. At this time, it was discovered that there were still idle people in the cooperative, and the elderly women had no work to do. Another symposium was held to study and decide that they would select cotton seeds. After such arrangements, all the farm work of the whole cooperative was carried out simultaneously and intensely, the enthusiasm of the masses for production was high, and the phenomena of gambling and going to the county to watch operas disappeared. The masses reflected that if the work team had come ten days earlier, the farm work of our cooperative would not have been so tight as it is now, and it could have been done smoothly; if it had come ten days later, many farm work would not have been able to catch up, which would have caused losses in the whole year's production.
    From this work in Liangsi Ferry, we have further understood the importance of helping farmers arrange production. Here, it is not just a question of arranging production in a planned way; at the same time, it can also fully tap the production potential of farmers and rationally allocate and use all labor force through this arrangement.
    Question: In order to strengthen the specific leadership of agricultural production, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance. I don't know how the County Committee understands and masters it?
    Answer: Farmers have this criticism of our cadres' lack of production technology: "I don't understand the old one, and you don't understand it either; I don't understand the new one, and you don't understand it either." This criticism is extremely profound. Because cadres are ignorant of production, they have also made a lot of jokes. When calling for pest control, our cadres did not know how to use pesticides and their properties. The cadres who promote new agricultural implements cannot use new agricultural implements and do not understand their properties. Once, a staff member of the agricultural technology promotion station went to a village to promote the warm water seed soaking method. After he helped farmers soak a batch of wheat seeds, the wheat seeds showed a phenomenon similar to mild fermentation. This was originally a normal phenomenon after seed soaking, but he thought it was soaked badly and was so scared that he quietly slipped back to the station. After some days, he came to this village again, and the farmers happily told him that the wheat seeds he had soaked had good seedlings, and he understood. Many cadres who promote new technologies cannot convince people with reason when they promote because they do not understand themselves. In this way, many coercive orders have also been generated; some have been asked two questions by farmers and cannot answer, so they dare not go to the countryside anymore. In the past, we rarely summarized and promoted the experiences and lessons of new technologies. If we succeeded, we were complacent; if we failed, we quietly did not dare to mention it again, which caused farmers to doubt science and technology and created difficulties in promoting new technologies. For example, when promoting chemical fertilizers, the first time, due to the wrong time and method of fertilization, it failed, and there was no summary of lessons, which caused farmers to generally oppose the use of chemical fertilizers in the second year. This situation shows that to lead production, cadres must delve into production, learn agricultural knowledge, master the laws of agriculture, and must also learn agricultural technology. Only in this way can they strengthen the leadership of agricultural production. This year, when promoting double-wheeled double-furrow plows, we first trained 40 professional cadres, and through them, we trained 360 technicians of agricultural production cooperatives, and taught 600 farmers who can use and disassemble double-furrow plows. As a result of the promotion, the farmers in the county welcomed the double-furrow plow very much, and the double-furrow plows that have been allocated to the county are in short supply. In future agricultural production, technical guidance has been elevated to an important position. If we are completely laymen, it will be difficult to conduct specific leadership. Of course, to improve technology, we must combine it with the specific conditions of local agricultural production. The Provincial Department of Agriculture put forward six major technological reforms to the province. After our research, we decided to focus on four (deep plowing and close planting, increasing the replanting area, selecting seeds for pest control, and accumulating fertilizer). We must not rigidly copy the experiences of other places, and we must attach importance to summarizing the experiences of the farmers in our county. In this regard, we have emphasized learning from old farmers, holding symposiums for old farmers to study the experiences in cultivation, and have achieved preliminary results.

    从一般化的领导到具体领导
　　——中共咸阳县委会访问记
　　陈浚　艾方
    陕西省咸阳县的春耕生产运动，有了比较显著的成绩。记者访问了中共咸阳县委会。县委副书记许廷方、县长印瑞祯、县委宣传部长米振民，生产合作部部长苏耀先四位同志，对记者提出的问题，作了集体的答复。他们的答复，说明了县委会开始克服了一般化的领导作风，加强了对农业生产的具体领导。下面是记者同他们的问答。
    问：今年全县春耕生产的成绩是怎样取得的？
    答：今年春耕生产运动所以能够做出成绩，有三方面原因：首先是坚决执行了围绕生产去整顿和巩固现有农业生产合作社的方针。春耕生产，在锄麦、搜集肥料、保证按照国家计划完成植棉和油料作物的面积、消灭虫害等四个方面，都是由农业生产合作社先动起来，带动和影响了广大的互助组和单干农民，造成了群众性运动。县委并缓办了在春耕期间发展农业生产合作社的原来计划，以领导生产为中心，进行整顿和巩固现有的社，安定了社员的生产情绪，扭转了生产中的混乱现象。全县一百一十三个农业生产合作社都制定和修订了全年生产计划和春耕生产计划，并带动了互助组的发展，整顿了七百二十四个互助组（五个区的统计），发展了一百四十三个互助组。现在全县有常年互助组七百零一个，临时互助组一千七百九十五个。有组织的农户已达到全县农户总数的百分之六十九。这就为开展春耕生产创造了有利条件。
    其次，在春耕中，普遍宣传了定产、定购、定销的政策，使农民进一步认识到统购统销政策的好处，国家利益同农民利益的一致性，消除了农民对征购工作的顾虑，提高了农民的生产积极性。农业生产合作社普遍修订了今年的生产计划，普遍提高了计划中的单位面积产量，并且订出了保证增产的具体措施。
    第三，县委在领导春耕生产上，改变了过去只发通知和号召的一般化的领导方法，调查了今年春耕生产的情况，根据上级指示和下面情况，县委提出春耕中四个主要环节：锄麦，开展搜集肥料运动，保证完成种植棉花和油料作物的国家计划，坚决消灭虫害和防御晚霜。接着召开了区乡干部会议，进行讨论，反复强调生产第一的思想。布置工作之后，县委委员分工到各区进行具体领导，定期回县汇报工作，进行检查，发现问题，进行研究，交流经验，围绕四个主要环节开展了春耕生产运动。
    问：能不能着重谈一谈县委是怎样改变一般化的领导作风的？
    答：县委在今年领导春耕生产以前，检查了过去的领导思想，认识到历年春耕运动中，形式上热火朝天，可是虚假现象很严重，无论是播种计划和防虫运动，都是如此。去年全县农业生产计划就没有完成。这是一个沉痛的教训。领导思想上，过去虽然也经常强调生产的重要性，但是总认为农民自己会搞生产，放松些也出不了大乱子。每当别的任务一来，往往就挤掉了生产工作，使生产陷入程度不同的自流状态。而县委本身，对于农业生产的知识和规律，并没有进行认真的钻研，对于全县农业生产情况，缺乏调查研究。这是一个思想问题。县委经过检查，批判了这些思想，进一步采取了具体措施，研究了三月到五月的生产工作，安排了其中重要的生产活动：二月中旬到三月中旬，进行拉土、送粪、锄草、翻地；三月中旬到四月中旬，进行施肥、耕完预留的棉田、防虫、防霜，进行选种播种等准备工作；四月中旬到五月中旬，大力防虫，准备夏收。然后把别的方面的工作按照生产活动的松紧，插了进去，制定了一个全县分段的工作计划。这样的统筹安排，可以确实保证以生产为中心，并使其他各方面的工作都围绕生产并为生产服务；从根本上克服了领导落后于农业生产需要的缺点，按照农业季节，抓紧每个时期最主要的农活，帮助农民安排农业生产。
    问：县委是怎样帮助农民安排农业生产的？能不能用一个例子来加以说明？
    答：对于帮助农民安排生产工作的必要性，过去县委也是认识不足的，以为农民自己还不会安排自己的生产吗？其实，我们却没有看到农业生产方面许多新情况，新问题，而农民还不习惯于这些新情况，新问题。例如去年冬季，由于农村工作繁重（征购工作、征集补充兵员工作等等），加上冬雪过大，有的棉田没有翻，肥料没有送到地里，积肥工作没有做好等等，今年一开春，工作都挤到一起，就很不容易安排。大部分新建的农业生产合作社，还缺乏领导集体生产的经验。领导上如果不看到这些新情况，不按照不同的情况，帮助农民安排生产，就不能积极领导群众克服困难，进行春耕生产。县委对全县干部强调提出了这个问题，要求各级干部加强对生产工作的具体领导，发挥互助合作网的作用，加强技术指导，改变过去只凭开会、动员，动嘴不动手的情况。渭滨乡两寺渡晓光农业生产合作社开展春耕生产的经过，可以说明帮助农民安排生产工作的重要性。
    两寺渡的晓光农业生产合作社，去年生产搞得好，影响很大，去年冬季扩大到一百四十三户。组织生产就变为更复杂的工作了。今年开春以后，新的问题出现了，一方面社里的活很多，另一方面，社员却闲着没活干，耍钱的、上县看戏的现象多起来了。送粪开始以后，每天套十辆车送，但是，谁也不知道全社有多少粪，要多少天能送完。县委生产合作部派去的干部发现了这种情况，就领导两寺渡支部，讨论了怎样加强对春耕生产的领导，召开了社主任和生产队长的座谈会，对农活进行了安排。会上发现春地还有四百多亩没有送粪，同时，翻地、锄草、精选棉籽、土地加工、修渠等许多农活也都要进行，可是畜力不足，不能把粪全部送到地里，并且还有三百亩地没有冬耕；送粪，翻地不能兼顾。座谈会上，讨论来，讨论去，粪也要送，地也要翻，还有麦地要锄。社干部起初提出要求放给农业贷款，最少也得再买二十头牛，才能调配过来。后来，计算了劳力和畜力，在劳力多的条件下，决定近地和自留地改用人力送粪，发动社员用锨翻地，发动全社妇女锄地。这时候，又发现了社里还有闲人，老年妇女们没有活干，又召开了座谈会进行研究，决定由她们选棉花种籽。经过这样的安排，全社的农活都同时紧张地开展起来，群众生产热情高涨，耍钱的、上县看戏的现象跟着消灭了。群众反映说：工作组要早来十天，我们社的农活，不至于赶得像现在那么紧，顺顺当当就可以做完了；要是再迟来十天，许多活，要赶也赶不出来了，那就会造成全年生产上的损失。
    从两寺渡的这一段工作中，我们更进一步领会到帮助农民安排生产的重要性。这里，不只是一个有计划地进行安排生产的问题；同时，也可以通过这种安排，充分发掘农民的生产潜力，合理地调配和使用全部劳动力。
    问：为了加强对农业生产的具体领导，需要加强技术指导，不知道县委是怎样来理解它和掌握它的？
    答：农民对我们的干部不懂生产技术有这样的批评：“旧的我懂你不懂，新的我不懂你也不懂。”这个批评是极其深刻的。由于干部对生产无知，也曾闹出过不少笑话。号召防治虫害时，我们的干部却不懂得杀虫的药械怎样使用和药的性能。推广新式农具的干部，却不会使用新式农具，也不懂它的性能。有一次，农业技术推广站的一个工作人员到一个村去推广温汤浸种法，当他帮助农民浸了一批麦种后，麦种出现了类似轻度发酵的现象。这本来是浸种后正常的现象，他却以为浸坏了，吓得他悄悄地溜回站去了。过了一些日子，他又来到这个村，农民们高兴地告诉他浸过的麦种出的苗很好，他才明白过来。有许多推广新技术的干部，由于自己不懂，宣传时，不能以理服人。这样，也就产生了不少强迫命令的事情；也有的被农民一问两问，问得答不上来，不敢再下乡了。过去我们又很少总结推广新技术的经验教训，成功了，得意洋洋；失败了，悄悄地不敢再提，以致引起农民对科学技术的怀疑，造成推广新技术的困难。比如推广化学肥料，第一次由于施肥的时候和方法不对，失败了，又没有总结教训，造成第二年农民普遍反对使用化学肥料。这种情况，说明了要领导生产，干部就要钻进生产去，学习农业知识，掌握农业的规律，还必须学习农业技术，只有这样才能加强对农业生产的领导。在今年推广双轮双铧犁的时候，我们首先训练了专业干部四十人，通过他们培养了三百六十名农业生产合作社的技术员，又传授了六百名会使用和装卸双铧犁的农民。推行的结果，全县农民十分欢迎双铧犁，已经调拨到县的双铧犁供不应求。在今后的农业生产中，技术指导已经被提到重要的地位。如果我们完全外行，就很难进行具体的领导。当然，要改进技术，必须结合本地农业生产的具体情况。省农业厅向全省提出六大技术改革，我们研究后，决定抓住四条（深耕密植、增加复种面积、选种防虫和积肥）。千万不能硬搬别处的经验，要重视总结本县农民的经验。在这方面，我们强调了向老农学习，召开老农的座谈会，来研究耕作中的经验，并已取得了初步的效果。
