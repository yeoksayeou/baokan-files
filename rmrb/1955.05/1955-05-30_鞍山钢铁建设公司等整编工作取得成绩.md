Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 27th: Since January 1955, Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company has streamlined over 1,900 management personnel exceeding the established quota from its functional departments. The number of staff members in the supply section of the Civil Engineering Construction Company has been reduced from 240 in 1954 to 55, and the number of personnel in the welfare sections of various construction and installation engineering companies and the administrative groups of various business offices has also been generally reduced by half. However, the work of these organizations has not been affected. Some units have improved labor organization and working methods in conjunction with streamlining the organization, and the work is being done better than last year.

　　The streamlined management personnel have been properly resettled.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, May 27th: The work of reorganizing the structure and streamlining the staffing of the Engineering Company directly under the Construction Engineering Department undertaking the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has been completed. After the reorganization, the number of cadres in the entire company was reduced by more than 2,000 compared with the end of 1954, and the number of odd-job workers and transportation personnel was reduced by nearly 600 compared with the end of 1954. Due to the reduction of unnecessary personnel, the abolition of institutions with little effect, the strengthening of construction management and construction technology leadership departments, and the enrichment of finance, accounting and other departments, the company's new structure is more reasonable and easier to work with than the original structure. For example, after the original Production Enterprise Department, which led affiliated enterprises, was abolished, the affiliated enterprises were transferred to the leadership of the current Construction Management Department, which made it easier for the construction management department to uniformly lead the various affiliated processing plants and better serve the construction site.

　　Now, the allocation of personnel within the establishment of this company has ended. Each unit is further mobilizing the masses in conjunction with the current work to study and improve leadership style and working methods. The surplus personnel have also been properly handled.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 27th: The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Communications has improved its work efficiency after streamlining its organization.

　　The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Communications originally had six administrative offices, two divisions, and twenty-eight sections, leading twelve public transportation enterprises such as public buses, trams, ferries, and transport trucks throughout the city. These administrative organizations were bloated, business overlapped, and they took on many of the tasks of the enterprise units. Over the past two years, after several adjustments and reforms, two offices and sixteen sections have been abolished successively, and some technical work has been transferred to various enterprise units. The number of staff members in the bureau has also been reduced from more than 430 to more than 160.

　　After the streamlining of the organization, the work guidelines and division of responsibilities of the various departments of the Bureau of Communications have become clearer, and the work has been improved. After the Production Technology Division and the Finance Division were adjusted from four or five sections each to two sections, each staff member had a work focus, and the quality and efficiency of the work were greatly improved. Although the basic construction organization and personnel have been streamlined by six-fifths, the work efficiency of vehicle and track maintenance projects has more than doubled.

　　After streamlining the organization, the leading cadres at all levels in the bureau have also gotten rid of the phenomenon of being busy with affairs. Now, the director can spare two days a week to go deep into various enterprise units to inspect and guide business.

### 鞍山钢铁建设公司等整编工作取得成绩

　　鞍山钢铁建设公司等整编工作取得成绩
    据新华社鞍山二十七日电　从一九五五年一月以来，鞍山钢铁建设公司已从职能机构中精简了一千九百多名超过定员标准的管理人员。土木建筑工程公司供应科的职员由一九五四年的二百四十名减少到五十五名，各建筑安装工程公司福利科和各业务处行政组的人员也都普遍地减少了一半，但是这些机构的工作并没有受到影响。有些单位结合精简机构改善了劳动组织和工作方法，工作做得比去年更好了。
    被精简的管理人员都得到了妥善的安置。
    据新华社长春二十七日电　承建第一汽车制造厂的建筑工程部直属工程公司整顿机构、精简编制的工作已经结束。整编后，全公司的干部比一九五四年年终时实有干部减少了两千多人，勤杂、交通等人员比一九五四年年终时减少了将近六百人。由于减少了不必要的人员，撤销了作用不大的机构，加强了施工管理和施工技术领导部门，充实了财务、会计等部门，公司新的机构比原有机构更加合理和便于进行工作。如把原来领导附属企业的生产企业处撤销后，把附属企业划归现在的施工管理处领导，这样就使得施工管理部门便于统一领导各附属加工厂，更好地为施工现场服务。
    现在，这个公司的编内人员调配工作已经结束。各单位正在结合当前工作进一步发动群众，研究改进领导作风和工作方法。编余人员也作了妥善的处理。
    据新华社上海二十七日电　上海市交通局精简机构后提高了工作效率。
    上海市交通局原设有行政机构六个处、二个室、二十八个科，领导着全市公共汽车、电车、轮渡和运输卡车等十二个公共交通企业。这些行政机构臃肿，业务重叠，包揽了许多企业单位的工作。两年以来，经过多次调整和改革，已经陆续撤销了两个处、十六个科，把一些技术性的工作调整到各企业单位去，全局工作人员也从四百三十多人紧缩到一百六十多人。
    机构精简以后，交通局各部门的工作方针和分工职责更加明确了，工作有了改进。生产技术处和财务处从过去各设四、五个科调整为两个科以后，每个工作人员都有了工作中心，工作质量和效率大大提高。基本建设机构和人员虽然精简了六分之五，车辆和轨线保养工程的工作效率却提高了一倍以上。
    经过精简机构以后，局里的各级领导干部也摆脱了事务忙乱的现象。现在，局长每星期能抽出两天时间深入到各企业单位检查和指导业务。
