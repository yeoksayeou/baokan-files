　　The Soviet Union's Economic Relations with Underdeveloped Countries
　　Chen Zhuo
    At the past sessions of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East and the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the Soviet representative has repeatedly reiterated the proposal to develop normal trade relations and economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and various economically backward countries, and expressed the Soviet Union's willingness to provide them with necessary technical assistance at the request of various countries.
    Due to the long-term aggression and exploitation by imperialist colonial countries, the economies of many countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America have remained in a backward state for a long time and have not been developed. They demand to develop their own national industries and national economies in order to overcome the serious consequences caused by the long-term rule of imperialism.
    However, there are still many obstacles and difficulties on the road to independent development in these countries. In order to extract important raw materials, dump their surplus products, and pursue super profits, imperialist countries have tried their best to prevent these countries from developing their own national industries, so that the economies of these countries continue to maintain their dependence on imperialist countries. The US monopoly capital's manipulation of raw material prices in the capitalist world market and the "embargo" and trade discrimination policies implemented by the United States have caused serious crises in the foreign trade of these countries. All these seriously hinder the normal economic development of backward countries. Imperialism uses the economic difficulties of backward countries to infiltrate these countries, expand its colonialist forces, and interfere in the policies of these countries.
    Contrary to the imperialist policy of taking advantage of the situation, the Soviet Union has always been concerned about the economic development of economically backward countries and has provided its assistance in this regard. In recent years, the economic relations between the Soviet Union and economically backward countries have developed significantly compared with the past, on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for sovereignty.
  　The Soviet Union now maintains trade ties with many economically backward countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, and has signed long-term trade agreements with many of them. In December 1953, the Soviet Union signed a five-year trade agreement with India. According to the provisions of this agreement, the Soviet Union exports oil and oil products, steel products, a large number of industrial equipment, chemicals, optical equipment, machine tools, tractors, agricultural machinery, electrical equipment, timber, paper and wheat to India, and India exports jute fabrics, tea, coffee, tobacco, spices, wool, hides, etc. to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and Afghanistan signed a trade agreement as early as 1950. In 1953, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan increased by one-third compared with 1952, and there has been further increase since then. The trade volume between the Soviet Union and Iran is also constantly increasing. In August 1953, the Soviet Union and Argentina signed a trade agreement stipulating that the Soviet Union would supply Argentina with a large amount of oil, coal, and various machinery and equipment, agricultural machinery, metals, railway equipment, chemicals, precision instruments, etc. needed for economic development, and import a large amount of linseed oil, wool, leather, lard, meat, and cheese, etc. from Argentina.
    The trade agreements signed between the Soviet Union and various economically backward countries are all equal and mutually beneficial. Taking into account the difficulties of these countries, the Soviet Union agrees that they can exchange various materials they need with products that are characteristic and abundant in their own countries, and can use their own currency for payment and settlement. This kind of trade agreement plays a great role in helping to develop the economy of backward countries, opening up outlets for the products of these countries, balancing the international balance of payments of these countries, and maintaining and expanding the number of employed people in these countries. Therefore, it has been welcomed by the broad masses of people in these countries. When talking about the importance of the Soviet-Iranian trade agreement, Iranian Minister of Economy Akhavi pointed out: "The increase in the volume of commodity exchange due to the new trade agreement signed with the Soviet Union will have a powerful impact on Iran's economic situation." The Indian "Free Press" evaluated the trade agreement signed between the Soviet Union and India at the end of 1953 in this way: "The more trade increases with the Soviet Union, the more jobs will be available to tens of thousands of Indians, and the situation in commerce and trade will also improve."
    At the meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council held in April 1954, the Soviet representative Zharapkin stated: "The Soviet Union is willing to do its best to help the economic development of backward countries, and it is willing to sell them industrial equipment and machinery. ... It is ready to study the specific requirements for technical assistance put forward by backward countries that are of great significance to these countries, such as the exploitation and processing of mineral raw materials, the development of metallurgical production, the development of machine manufacturing, especially the manufacturing of agricultural machinery, the development of the textile and food industries, the development of rubber processing enterprises, the construction of hydroelectric and thermal power stations, technical assistance in flood control and irrigation, locust control, and helping to train and improve the technical skills of industrial and other departments in backward countries."
    Now many economically backward countries have received or are receiving such sincere help from the Soviet Union. With the help of the Soviet Union, Afghanistan has built a cotton ginning factory, several oil depots, and erected 1,500 kilometers of telegraph and telephone lines. According to the agreement signed in 1954, the Soviet Union also helped Afghanistan build two mechanized granaries, a flour mill and a mechanized bakery. The Soviet Union will be responsible for the design and installation of the above-mentioned projects, supply the necessary equipment, and be responsible for the start-up of the enterprises. After these enterprises are completed, Afghanistan will be able to improve the supply of bread to residents and establish the necessary grain reserves.
    According to the agreement signed between the Soviet government and the Indian government on February 2, 1955, the Soviet Union will help India build a huge metallurgical plant with an annual output of one million tons of steel and a corresponding amount of steel products. The Soviet Union will supply all the equipment needed for the construction of this factory that India cannot currently manufacture, and will be responsible for the site survey, project design and technical leadership of the construction of the factory. In order to facilitate India's repayment of the equipment and other expenses required for the construction of this factory, the Soviet Union agreed to grant India a preferential loan for a period of twelve years, and can repay it in Indian rupees. Now the Soviet Union has sent many metallurgical experts to India, and preparations for the construction of the factory have begun. The entire project is scheduled to be completed in 1959. Building such a large-scale metallurgical plant in such a short period of time is unprecedented in the history of India and other economically backward countries. Since the establishment of India's first steel plant in 1907, for nearly half a century, India's steel output has only reached 1.4 to 1.5 million tons per year, and with the help of the Soviet Union, India will be able to increase its steel output by two-thirds in four or five years. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out in his report to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on February 8 this year, when talking about the relations between the Soviet Union and India: "We are very happy to agree to these requests, because the development of India's metallurgical industry will help to ensure the national independence and economic development of this ancient and great country, which the Soviet people of all nationalities sympathize with wholeheartedly."
    The Soviet Union's large-scale supply of machinery and equipment to backward countries is only to help them build their own national industries, and does not attach any political conditions or requirements for obtaining economic privileges. These enterprises built with the help of the Soviet Union are entirely owned by the country in which they are located, and at the same time, the products produced by these enterprises are entirely controlled and disposed of by the country in which they are located. This is fundamentally different from the imperialist countries' use of so-called economic "aid" to interfere in the politics of the "aided" countries, plunder the economic resources of the "aided" countries, dump surplus products to the "aided" countries, and turn the "aided" countries into their own dependencies.
    Imperialist countries do not want backward countries to develop national industries at all, because this is contrary to their imperialist interests of extracting maximum profits from these countries. At the meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council held in June 1954, the US representative insisted on removing the issue of developing the industry of backward countries from the agenda of the meeting. Imperialism is keen to invest in backward countries, but the purpose is to extract the rich resources and cheap labor of backward countries. According to the Soviet magazine "Economic Issues" in January 1955, the profits withdrawn from Latin America by foreign monopoly capital (mainly US monopoly capital) every year are equal to one-fifth of the national income of these countries.
    In recent years, economically backward countries have increasingly deeply felt the serious harm of economic expansion by imperialist countries to them. At the same time, in all economically backward countries, the call for developing economic exchanges and cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is getting louder and louder. Many people in these countries have seen that developing economic relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries based on equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs is truly helpful to them in developing their own economy and consolidating national independence.

　　苏联同落后国家的经济关系
　　陈卓
    在联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会和联合国经济和社会理事会的历届会议上，苏联代表曾经一再重申发展它同各个经济落后国家之间正常的贸易关系和经济合作的主张，并表示苏联愿意根据各国的请求，给它们以必要的技术援助。
    由于长期遭受到帝国主义殖民国家的侵略和剥削，亚洲、中近东、非洲和拉丁美洲的许多国家的经济曾经长时期停留在落后的状态而得不到发展。它们要求发展自己的民族工业和国民经济，以克服帝国主义长期统治所造成的严重后果。
    但是在这些国家独立发展的道路上还有不少的障碍和困难。帝国主义国家为了榨取重要的原料物资、倾销自己的剩余产品和追求超额的利润，竭力阻挠这些国家发展自己的民族工业，使这些国家的经济继续保持其对帝国主义国家的从属关系。美国垄断资本操纵资本主义世界市场的原料价格和美国所实行的“禁运”和贸易歧视政策，又使这些国家的对外贸易遭到严重危机。这些都严重地妨碍了落后国家的经济的正常发展。帝国主义利用落后国家经济上的困难，渗入这些国家，扩展殖民主义的势力，并干涉这些国家的政策。
    和帝国主义的趁火打劫的政策相反，苏联一向关怀着经济落后国家的经济发展，并在这方面提供自己的帮助。这些年来，在平等互利和互相尊重主权的基础上，苏联同经济落后国家的经济关系已比从前有了显著的发展。
  　苏联现在同亚洲、中近东和拉丁美洲的许多经济落后国家保持着贸易联系，并和其中不少国家订有长期的贸易协定。一九五三年十二月苏联同印度签订了为期五年的贸易协定。根据这个协定的规定，苏联对印度输出石油和石油产品，钢铁产品，大批工业设备，化学品，光学设备，工作母机，拖拉机，农业机器，电气装备，木材，纸张和小麦等，印度对苏联输出麻织品，茶，咖啡，烟草，香料，羊毛，兽皮等。苏联同阿富汗早在一九五○年就签订了贸易协定。一九五三年苏联和阿富汗之间的贸易额比一九五二年增加了三分之一，这以后又有了进一步的增加。苏联和伊朗的贸易额也不断增加。一九五三年八月，苏联和阿根廷签订了贸易协定，规定苏联供给阿根廷以发展经济所需要的大量的石油、煤以及各种机器装备，农业机器，金属，铁路设备，化学品，精密仪器等，并自阿根廷输入大量的亚麻油、羊毛、皮革、猪油、肉类和干酪等。
    苏联同各经济落后国家签订的贸易协定，都是平等互利的。考虑到这些国家的困难，苏联同意它们以本国所特产和盛产的产品来交换它们所需要的各种物资，并可以用本国的货币来支付和结算。这种贸易协定在帮助发展落后国家的经济、开辟这些国家产品的出路、平衡这些国家的国际收支、维持和扩大这些国家的就业人数方面起着很大的作用，因而受到了这些国家广大人民的欢迎。伊朗经济大臣阿哈维在讲到苏伊贸易协定的重要性时指出：“由于和苏联签订的新的贸易协定增加了商品交换额，这将对伊朗的经济情况发生有力的影响。”印度的“自由报”这样评价了苏联和印度之间在一九五三年底签订的贸易协定：“和苏联的贸易增加得愈多，成千成万的印度人将得到更多的工作，商业和贸易情况也将改善。”
    在一九五四年四月举行的联合国经济和社会理事会会议上，苏联代表查拉普金曾声明：“苏联愿意尽力帮助落后国家的经济发展，它愿意把工业设备和机器卖给它们。……它准备研究落后国家提出的对于这些国家有重要意义的技术援助的具体要求，如矿物原料的开采和加工、冶金生产的发展、机器制造、特别是农业机器制造、纺织和食品工业的发展、橡胶加工企业的发展、水电站和火力发电站的建筑，治洪和灌溉、除蝗工作中的技术援助，以及帮助训练和提高落后国家的工业与其他部门的工作人员的技术等。”
    现在已有不少经济落后国家得到了或正在得到苏联这种真诚的帮助。在苏联的帮助下，阿富汗已建立了一座清棉工厂、几座油库，架设了一千五百公里长的电报和电话线。根据一九五四年签订的协定，苏联还帮助阿富汗建设两座机械化谷仓，一座面粉厂和一座机械化面包厂。苏联将负责上述工程的设计与安装工作，供应必要的装备，负责企业的开工。这些企业建成以后，阿富汗将能改善对于居民的面包供应并建立起必要的谷物储备。
    根据苏联政府同印度政府在一九五五年二月二日签订的协定，苏联将帮助印度建设一座年产一百万吨钢和相应数量的钢材的巨大冶金工厂。苏联将供应为建设这个工厂所需而目前印度尚不能制造的全部装备，并负责厂址的勘测，工程的设计与建厂的技术领导工作。为了便利印度偿付建设这个工厂所需的装备和其他各项费用，苏联同意给予印度以为期十二年的优惠贷款，并可以用印度本国的货币卢比来偿付。现在苏联已派遣冶金专家多人前往印度，建厂的准备工作已经开始进行。整个工程预定在一九五九年全部完成。在这样短短的时期内建成规模这样巨大的冶金工厂，这在印度和其他经济落后国家的历史上是前所未有的。自从一九○七年印度第一座炼钢厂成立到现在，将近半个世纪，印度的钢产量还不过达到年产一百四、五十万吨，而在苏联的帮助下，印度在四、五年内就能把钢产量增加三分之二。苏联外交部长莫洛托夫今年二月八日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的报告中谈到苏联和印度的关系时指出：“我们非常乐意地答应了这些请求，因为印度冶金工业的发展，将有助于保障这个苏联各族人民全心全意同情的古老的和伟大的国家的民族独立和经济发展。”
    苏联这样大规模地对落后国家供应机器装备，只是为了帮助它们建设自己民族的工业，并不附有任何政治条件或取得经济特权的要求。这些在苏联帮助下建设起来的企业，完全属它所在的国家所有，同时这些企业所出产的产品，也完全归它所在的国家掌握和支配。这和帝国主义国家利用所谓经济“援助”来干涉受“援”国家的政治，掠夺受“援”国家的经济资源，向受“援”国倾销剩余产品，把受“援”国变成自己的附庸，是根本不同的。
    帝国主义国家根本就不希望落后国家发展民族工业，因为这是同它们从这些国家榨取最大限度利润的帝国主义利益相抵触的。美国代表在一九五四年六月举行的联合国经济和社会理事会会议上就坚持主张把有关发展落后国家工业的问题从会议的议程中除去。帝国主义是热中于向落后国家投资的，但目的是榨取落后国家丰富的资源和廉价的人力。据苏联“经济问题”杂志一九五五年一月号载称，外国垄断资本（主要是美国垄断资本）每年从拉丁美洲抽走的利润，等于这些国家的国民收入的五分之一。
    这些年来，经济落后国家已愈来愈深切地感受到了帝国主义国家经济扩张对于它们的严重危害。同时，在所有经济落后国家内，要求同苏联和人民民主国家发展经济交流和合作的呼声是愈来愈高了。这些国家的许多人士已经看到：同苏联和人民民主国家开展建立在平等互利、互相尊重主权、互不干涉内政的基础上的经济关系，是真正有助于它们发展自己的经济和巩固民族独立的。
