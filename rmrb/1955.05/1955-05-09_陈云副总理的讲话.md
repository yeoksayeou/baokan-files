Comrade Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

    Today is the tenth anniversary of the German people's liberation from the enslavement of Hitlerite fascism, and also the glorious festival of the great victory in the war against German fascism. At this grand celebratory banquet, please allow me, on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, to extend warm congratulations to you, Comrade Ambassador, and through you to the government of the German Democratic Republic and the entire German people.

    Ten years ago, thanks to the heroic struggle of the heroic Soviet army, the Soviet people, and the peace-loving people of the world, the war against German fascism achieved final victory. Based on the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, Germany should be restored as a unified and independent country on a peaceful and democratic basis, thereby enabling the German people to embark on the path of peaceful development. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic, leading the working class and working people of democratic Germany, and uniting all patriotic and democratic forces, have achieved tremendous accomplishments in consolidating the people's democratic system, developing the national economy, improving the people's living standards, striving for the peaceful reunification of Germany, and defending European peace. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the achievements of the German people. The German Democratic Republic has become a strong bastion for striving for the peaceful reunification of Germany and defending European peace, and it has the support of the entire German people and all peace-loving countries and people in the world.

    However, the Western countries, headed by the United States, have consistently obstructed the peaceful reunification of Germany, so that although the war ended ten years ago, Germany remains divided. The US monopoly capitalist groups, in order to pursue maximum profits and enslave the people of all countries in the world, are actively preparing to launch another new world war, and they attempt to arm West Germany as a tool for launching a new war. Not long ago, the US aggressive bloc and its followers, disregarding the repeated warnings of the Soviet government, disregarding the firm opposition of peace-loving countries and people in the world, disregarding the vital interests of the German people, and disregarding all international agreements related to resolving the German question, openly signed and ratified the Paris Agreements, rebuilt the Wehrmacht led by Hitlerite fascists, and dragged West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization aggressive bloc. This has worsened the current European situation and greatly increased the danger of a new war. The Chinese people resolutely support all the measures that the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and other people's democratic countries have already taken and will take to ensure European collective security. We are convinced that the powerful peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, uniting the world's growing forces of peace and democracy, will surely be able to crush the imperialists' shameful conspiracy to launch a new war.

    The friendship between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic is developing day by day. Our two countries' cooperation in politics, economy, and culture is also becoming closer day by day. We are deeply convinced that in the struggle to defend world peace and in the cause of socialist construction, the fraternal friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Germany will surely continue to develop and be consolidated.

    Dear Comrades, Friends: On this day of great historical significance, let me raise my glass:

    To the fraternal friendship between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic!

    To the health of President Wilhelm Pieck, leader of the German working people!

    To the health of Prime Minister Grotewohl!

    To the German people's struggle to establish a unified, independent, peaceful, and democratic Germany!

### 陈云副总理的讲话

　　陈云副总理的讲话亲爱的大使同志、同志们、朋友们：
    今天是德国人民从希特勒法西斯的奴役下获得解放的十周年纪念日，也是伟大的反对德国法西斯的战争获得胜利的光荣节日。在这个盛大的庆祝宴会上，请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向您、大使同志，并通过您向德意志民主共和国政府和全德国人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    十年前，由于英雄的苏联军队、苏联人民和世界爱好和平人民的英勇斗争，反对德国法西斯的战争取得了最后的胜利。依据波茨坦协定的原则，德国应当在和平、民主的基础上恢复成为一个统一独立的国家，从而使德国人民有可能走上和平发展的道路。德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府领导着民主德国的工人阶级和劳动人民，并团结一切爱国民主力量，在巩固人民民主制度、发展国民经济、提高人民生活水平、争取德国的和平统一和保卫欧洲和平的斗争中，都取得了巨大的成就。中国人民为德国人民获得的成就感到欢欣鼓舞。德意志民主共和国已经成为争取德国和平统一和保卫欧洲和平的坚强堡垒，它得到全体德国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。
    然而以美国为首的西方国家却一贯地阻挠德国的和平统一，以致战争虽已结束十年，但德国仍处于分裂状态。美国垄断资本集团，为了追逐最大限度的利润，奴役世界各国人民，正积极准备发动另一次新的世界战争，他们企图武装西德作为他们发动新战争的工具。不久以前，美国侵略集团及其追随者不顾苏联政府一再提出的警告，不顾世界爱好和平的国家和人民的坚决反对，不顾德国人民的切身利益，不顾一切有关解决德国问题的国际协定，公然签订和批准了巴黎协定，重建由希特勒法西斯分子率领的国防军，并把西德拉入北大西洋公约侵略集团。这就使得目前的欧洲局势趋向恶化，并使新战争的危险大大增加。中国人民坚决支持苏联、德意志民主共和国和其他各人民民主国家为保障欧洲集体安全所已经采取和将要采取的一切措施。我们确信，以苏联为首的强大的和平、民主、社会主义阵营团结着全世界日益增长的和平民主力量，一定能够粉碎帝国主义发动新战争的可耻阴谋。
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的友谊一天比一天地发展。我们两国在政治上、经济上、文化上的合作也一天比一天地密切。我们深信，在保卫世界和平的斗争中，在社会主义建设的事业中，中德两国兄弟般的友好合作关系，一定会得到不断的发展和巩固。
    亲爱的同志们、朋友们：在这个具有重大历史意义的节日里，让我举杯
    为中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的兄弟友谊、
    为德国劳动人民的领袖威廉·皮克总统的健康、
    为格罗提渥总理的健康、
    为德国人民争取建立一个统一、独立、和平和民主的德国而干杯！
