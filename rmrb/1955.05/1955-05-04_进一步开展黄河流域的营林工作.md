To further develop afforestation work in the Yellow River Basin

Zhang Zhao, Director of the Afforestation Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry

The vast Yellow River Basin, with a population of over 180 million, is China's main production area for wheat, cotton, and millet, and is also rich in mineral and water resources. However, due to the long-term destruction of reactionary rule, the forests and large grasslands in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River have been destroyed, resulting in severe soil erosion. According to surveys, in the 370,000 square kilometer area of the middle reaches of the Yellow River, an average of 3,700 tons of sediment are lost per square kilometer every year. Severe soil erosion is the main cause of natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and wind and sand in the Yellow River Basin.

In the past few years, the provinces in the Yellow River Basin have done a lot of work in afforestation and cultivation. According to incomplete statistics from six provinces and regions (autonomous regions) including Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Henan, and Inner Mongolia, more than 150,000 hectares of forests have been planted and more than 1 million hectares of mountains have been closed for afforestation in the Yellow River Basin. Some places have begun to reap the benefits of afforestation and cultivation. For example, the black locust saplings planted in Tianjiazhuang, Tianshui County, Gansu Province, have stabilized the gullies originally eroded by rainwater and have begun to conserve water sources. In some areas with scarce drinking water in Qinghai Province, as a result of closing mountains for afforestation, not only is there ample water for people and animals, but also water for irrigation in the fields. However, these achievements are still very small compared to the huge afforestation project in the Yellow River Basin in the future.

In order to carry out soil and water conservation work in the loess area on a planned and large scale, so as to change the face of the Yellow River Basin, in the next three years, on the one hand, we must focus on carrying out afforestation and cultivation work in areas with severe soil erosion, and at the same time, we must conduct comprehensive investigation, planning and design to prepare for large-scale afforestation work in the future. The protection forests that need to be investigated, designed and started for partial construction are: In Shaanxi Province, there are sand prevention forests in northern Shaanxi and water source forests in the upper reaches of rivers such as the Luo River; in Gansu Province, there are water source forests in the upper reaches of rivers such as the Jing River, Wei River, and Zuli River; in Shanxi Province, there are water source forests in the upper reaches of the Fen River and various rivers in western Shanxi; in Henan Province, there are water source forests in the Yi River and Luo River and water source forests on the north bank of the Yellow River; in Qinghai Province, there are Huangshui water source forests; in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there are western protection forests and water source forests in the upper reaches of the Ula Mountain and Dahei River. In total, 173,280 hectares of forests are to be planted and 472,000 hectares of mountains are to be closed for afforestation in the next three years.

In order to complete the above tasks, we must do the following tasks well in the next three years. (1) Determine key construction areas and establish work base points. Since the area of soil erosion in the Yellow River Basin is very wide, and afforestation work is very complicated, and our work foundation is still relatively weak, each province must delineate key areas for forestry construction in order to concentrate the use of forces and effectively carry out afforestation work. In key areas, afforestation work must start from the establishment of work base points. That is to say, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee and government and the guidance of forestry authorities, delineate a small area of soil and water conservation, take the township and village as units, rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, conduct forestry regionalization and mountain production planning, formulate plans for comprehensive development of production and soil and water conservation, and green the mountains in stages. Set an example in the base point, gain experience, and then use it to guide the overall situation. The base point should generally be selected in areas with a better foundation for mutual aid and cooperation and representative in afforestation and soil and water conservation. The method of establishing afforestation work base points in Suide Special Area of Shaanxi Province is that the special area establishes points, and people from each county come; the county establishes points, and people from each district come; the district establishes points, and people from each township come; the township establishes points, and people from each village come. This method can not only train cadres, educate the masses, and spread experience, but also make the process of establishing points actually become the process of expanding the area. Generally speaking, in the key areas already determined in each province and region, all counties with better conditions should strive to have points in each township or district by 1957. At present, some key counties have not yet established forestry professional institutions, and cadres should be assigned to gradually establish them. The existing institutions are not sound and should be rectified and strengthened.

(2) Do a good job in investigation and planning. In order to rationally utilize land and arrange soil and water conservation work, each province and region should refer to the Yellow River Basin planning plan, combine with mountain production planning, complete the general survey of key areas, and propose an overall planning plan to propose indicators for future afforestation work. In the afforestation work base point, a detailed survey should be conducted and a design should be made for construction. In the process of investigation and planning, it is necessary to unite agriculture, animal husbandry, water conservancy and other relevant departments under the unified leadership of the Party committee and the government; and go deep into the masses and rely on the masses to do this work well. Cadres in the three aspects of investigation, design and construction of afforestation work must closely cooperate, learn from each other, so that the work of the three aspects is connected to each other and improve the quality of work. (3) Must rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Whether large-scale afforestation or mountain closure for afforestation requires collective action and collective management. Therefore, afforestation work in the Yellow River Basin must closely rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The experiences of mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives that have been established and have forestry production content should be well summarized. All localities should earnestly run several mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives with forestry production content in key afforestation areas as examples to attract the broad masses to participate in mutual aid and cooperation. In mountainous and hilly areas with severe soil erosion, agricultural production cooperatives should, under the conditions of voluntariness and possibility, adopt a form combining agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry, and incorporate various types of production into a unified plan and organization.

(4) Strengthen forest protection and mountain closure for afforestation. The existing forests in the Yellow River Basin are of great importance for soil and water conservation, and we must protect them well. Areas with forests should gradually establish forestry professional institutions to manage and manage the forests so as to avoid damage to the forests. These areas should establish forest protection organizations based on mutual aid and cooperation organizations and individual farmers, and formulate forest protection covenants to protect the normal growth of forests.

Closing mountains for afforestation and grass cultivation is an important way to prevent soil and water loss. Closing mountains for afforestation is best carried out in units of districts and townships. After the Hetao Administrative Region of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suide, Pingliang, Baoji, Yulin and other special areas of Shaanxi Province partially implemented closing mountains, closing beaches and closing sands for afforestation and grass cultivation, they not only achieved the effects of maintaining soil and water, fixing sand and protecting banks, but also increased firewood and grass production, expanded pastures, and promoted the natural regeneration of forests. To do a good job in closing mountains for afforestation, first, it must be carried out in a unified plan and overall arrangement under the unified leadership of the Party committee and the government through mountain production planning. Second, it is necessary to widely publicize the forest protection policy to the masses, and discuss with the masses to formulate a reasonable mountain closure and afforestation system to take care of the masses' habits of firewood and grazing and sideline production.

(5) Do a good job in seed and seedling supply. The supply of tree seeds and seedlings is a very weak link in the current afforestation work in the Yellow River Basin. The current problems in this work are: poor planning, improper nursery settings, poor management, backward seedling raising technology, low seedling production, and large waste. In order to make the seed and seedling supply work adapt to the needs of the development of afforestation work, first of all, it is necessary to formulate a plan to adjust and develop nurseries based on the afforestation planning plan of each locality. All localities should also earnestly investigate and delineate mother tree forests, establish seed collection bases, and organize the masses to protect and cultivate them. The existing state-owned nurseries must improve management and increase the yield and quality of seedlings. However, relying solely on state-owned nurseries is far from meeting the needs of afforestation work. Therefore, it is also necessary to rely on rural mutual aid and cooperation organizations to carry out mass seed collection and seedling raising work by means of self-cultivation, self-afforestation or entrusted seedling raising.

(6) Carry out experimental research. In order to carry out afforestation and soil and water conservation work, each province and region should gradually establish experimental research institutions in representative areas according to needs and cadre conditions. This institution should scientifically summarize the experience of the masses, so as to study soil and water conservation methods that are easily accepted and feasible by the local masses. At present, the main tasks of experimental research work are: to plan tree species in each soil erosion area, and to conduct experimental research on seedling raising and planting methods of main tree species. The experimental research institution should combine the work of the afforestation base point and cultivate technical backbones in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups.

　　进一步开展黄河流域的营林工作
　　林业部造林局长　张昭
    拥有一亿八千多万人口的广大的黄河流域，是我国的小麦、棉花、谷子的主要产区，矿产资源和水利资源也很丰富。但是，由于反动统治的长期摧残，黄河中、上游的森林和大片草原遭到破坏，造成了严重的水土流失现象。据调查，在黄河中游三十七万平方公里地区内，平均每年每平方公里要流失三千七百吨泥沙。严重的水土流失，是黄河流域发生水旱风沙等自然灾害的主要根源。
    几年来，黄河流域各省在造林、育林方面，已做了不少的工作。根据陕西、甘肃、山西、河南、内蒙古等六个省、区（自治区）的不完全统计，已在黄河流域地区造林十五万多公顷，封山育林一百万多公顷。有些地方已开始得到了造林育林的好处，如甘肃省天水县田家庄造的洋槐幼林，已经固定了原来由雨水冲刷成的沟壑，而且开始涵养了水源；青海省一些饮水稀少的地区，由于封山育林的结果，不但人畜用水充沛，田里也有水灌溉了。但，这些成绩，对于今后黄河流域巨大的营林工程来说，还是很微小的。
    为了有计划地大规模地开展黄土区域的水土保持工作，以求改变黄河流域的面貌，今后三年内必须一方面在水土流失严重的地区有重点地开展造林、育林工作，同时还要全面地进行调查规划设计，为将来大规模的营林工作做好准备。要进行调查设计和开始局部营造的保安林：在陕西省的有陕北地区的防沙林，洛河等河流上游的水源林；在甘肃省的有泾河、渭河、祖厉河等河流上游的水源林；在山西省的有汾河和晋西各河上游的水源林；在河南省的有伊河、洛河的水源林和黄河北岸的水源林；在青海省的有湟水水源林；在内蒙古自治区的有西部防护林和乌拉山和大黑河上游的水源林。总计在今后三年内要造林十七万三千二百八十公顷，封山育林四十七万二千公顷。
    为了完成上述任务，在今后三年内我们必须做好以下几项工作。（一）确定重点建设地区，建立工作基点。由于黄河流域水土流失区的面很广，而营林工作又很复杂，加上我们的工作基础还比较薄弱，因此，各省必须划定林业重点建设地区，以便集中使用力量，有成效地开展营林工作。在重点区内，营林工作又必须从建立工作基点做起。这就是说，要在当地党委和政府的统一领导下和林业机关的指导下，划定面积较小的水土保持区，以乡、村为单位，依靠互助合作组织，进行林业区划和山区生产规划，制定全面发展生产和水土保持工作的计划，分期绿化山区。在基点内做出榜样，取得经验，再用以指导全面。基点一般应选择互助合作基础较好、在营林和水土保持上有代表性的地区。陕西省绥德专区建立营林工作基点的方法是专区建点，县县来人；县建点，区区来人；区建点，乡乡来人；乡建点，村村来人。这个方法，不仅可以培养干部，教育群众，传播经验，而且使建点过程实际上也成为扩展面的过程。一般地说，在各省、区已确定的重点地区内，凡是条件较好的县，都应争取在一九五七年以内做到乡乡有点或区区有点。目前有些重点县还没有建立林业专业机构，应配备干部逐步建立起来，已有的机构也不健全，应加以整顿和加强。
    （二）做好调查规划工作。为了合理地利用土地和安排水土保持工作，各省、区应参照黄河流域规划方案，结合山区生产规划，完成重点地区的概况调查，提出总体规划方案，为今后的营林工作提出指标。在营林工作基点，更要进行精细调查，做出设计，以便施工。在进行调查规划工作中，必须在党委和政府的统一领导下，联合农业、牧畜业和水利等有关部门协同动作；并应深入群众，依靠群众作好这件工作。营林工作的调查、设计、施工三方面的干部必须密切配合，互相学习，使三方面的工作互相衔接，提高工作质量。（三）必须依靠互助合作组织。不论大片造林或封山育林，都需要集体行动，集体经营。因此，黄河流域的营林工作，必须紧紧依靠互助合作组织。对已经建立的、有林业生产内容的互助组和农业生产合作社，应很好地总结经验。各地都应在营林重点地区切实办好几个有林业生产内容的互助组和农业生产合作社，作为吸引广大群众参加互助合作的榜样。在水土流失严重的山区和丘陵区，农业生产合作社应在自愿和可能的条件下，采取农、林、牧相结合的形式，把多种多样的生产纳入统一的计划和组织内。
    （四）加强护林和封山育林工作。黄河流域现有的森林对于水土保持具有极重要的意义，我们必须把它很好地保护起来。有森林的地区，应当逐步地建立起林业专业机构，把森林经营管理起来，以免林木遭到破坏。这些地区都应以互助合作组织为基础联合个体农民，建立护林组织，订立护林公约，以便保护林木的正常生长。
    封山育林养草，是防止水土流失的重要办法。封山育林最好以区、乡为单位来进行。内蒙古自治区河套行政区和陕西省绥德、平凉、宝鸡、榆林等专区，部分地实行封山封滩封沙育林育草以后，不仅收到保持水土、固沙、护岸的效果，同时还增产了柴草，扩大了牧场，促进了森林的天然更新。要做好封山育林工作，第一，必须在党委和政府的统一领导下，通过山区生产规划工作，进行统一计划和全面安排，有步骤地开展封山育林。第二、要向群众广泛宣传护林政策，并同群众商量订出合理的封山育林制度，照顾群众的樵牧习惯和副业生产等。
    （五）做好种苗供应工作。树木种苗供应工作是当前黄河流域营林工作中极薄弱的一环。目前这一工作中存在的问题是：计划性差，苗圃设置不当，经营管理不善，育苗技术落后，产苗量低，浪费大。为了使种苗供应工作适应营林工作发展的需要，首先必须根据各地造林规划方案，制定调整和发展苗圃的计划。各地还应认真调查和划定母树林，建立采种基地，组织群众加以保护抚育。现有的国营苗圃必须改善经营管理，提高苗木的产量和质量。但，光靠国营苗圃，是远不能满足营林工作需要的，因此还必须依靠农村互助合作组织，采取自育、自造或委托育苗的方式，开展群众性的采种、育苗工作。
      （六）开展试验研究工作。为了开展营林和水土保持工作，各省、区应根据需要和干部条件，在有代表性的地区逐渐建立试验研究机构。这个机构应对群众的经验加以科学的总结，从而研究出为当地群众所容易接受的而又切实可行的水土保持方法。目前，试验研究工作的主要任务是：对各土壤侵蚀区的树种进行规划，对主要树种的育苗和栽植方法进行试验研究。试验研究机构应结合营林基点的工作，和培养农业生产合作社、互助组中的技术骨干。
