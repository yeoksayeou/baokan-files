The Xishui County Local State-Owned Farm Implement Factory in Hubei Province, after repeated trials and improvements, has modified a type of dragon bone water wheel, which is very popular with local farmers.

Through precise testing, the improved dragon bone water wheel has several advantages over the old-style dragon bone water wheel: 1. Under the same conditions, the improved water wheel's water pumping efficiency is one-third higher than that of the old-style dragon bone water wheel. 2. Under the same conditions, the improved water wheel saves one person's labor compared to the old-style water wheel. 3. Simple structure and low cost. Generally, old-style dragon bone water wheels require dozens of paddles, while the improved water wheel only needs three. The cost of an old-style water wheel is more than 39 yuan, while the improved water wheel costs only more than 34 yuan per unit.
