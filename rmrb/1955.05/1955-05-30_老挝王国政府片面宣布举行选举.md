Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 28th (via telegram): Vientiane Dispatch: The Ministry of Interior of the Royal Lao Government announced on the 25th that it has decided to hold legislative elections in Laos on August 28th, to elect thirty-nine members of parliament by universal suffrage. The election campaign will begin forty days before the election date.

The dispatch stated that this “universal suffrage” was unilaterally decided by the Royal Lao Government. In order to fulfill the Geneva Accords and the interests of the Lao people, the Lao Fighting Units suggested during political conferences with the Royal Government that a political consultative committee be established to resolve basic political issues, including universal suffrage. However, the Royal Lao Government has consistently rejected this suggestion and has interrupted the political conferences.

　　老挝王国政府片面宣布举行选举
    新华社河内二十八日电　万象消息：老挝王国政府内政部二十五日宣布，决定在八月二十八日在老挝举行立法选举，以普选方式选出三十九个议会议员。竞选运动将在选举日四十天前开始。
    消息说，这个“普选”是由老挝王国政府片面决定的。为了履行日内瓦协定和老挝人民的利益，寮国战斗部队曾在同王国政府举行的政治会议上建议，成立政治协商委员会来解决包括普选在内的基本政治问题。然而，老挝王国政府方面一直拒绝这个建议，并且中断了政治会议。
