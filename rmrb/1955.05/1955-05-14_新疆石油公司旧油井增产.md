　　Xinjiang Petroleum Company Increases Production in Old Oil Wells
    The various ethnic groups of oil extraction workers in the Dushanzi mining area of the Xinjiang Petroleum Company, based on suggestions from Soviet experts, adopted a series of production increase measures, raising the average daily production of old wells in April by 4.2% compared to March, exceeding the state's production requirements for these old wells. Among them, one flowing well often spewed out large amounts of mud and sand before April, seriously affecting the oil well's production. In March, according to suggestions from Soviet experts, the well was repaired, and after installing pressure gauges and oil nozzles on the well, its crude oil daily output increased nearly three times compared to the past, and the production of natural gas also greatly increased. Two old wells that had not produced oil for nearly half a year have now also resumed production.
    The various ethnic groups of oil extraction workers in this mining area have recently begun implementing two other more important suggestions put forward by Soviet experts. After these two suggestions are implemented, the oil production of old wells will further increase. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　新疆石油公司旧油井增产
    新疆石油公司独山子矿区各族采油职工，根据苏联专家建议采取了一系列的增产措施，使旧井四月份的平均日产量比三月份提高了百分之四点二，超额完成了国家对这些旧井的生产要求。其中有一口自喷井在四月以前常常喷出大量的泥浆和砂子，严重地影响了油井的生产。三月间，根据苏联专家建议对这口井进行了修理，并在井上安装了压力表和油咀以后，它的原油日产量比过去提高了近三倍，天然气的产量也大大增加。还有两口将近半年不出油的旧井，现在也重新出油了。
    这个矿区的各族采油职工最近又开始实行苏联专家提出的另外两项更重要的建议。这两项建议实行以后，旧井的出油量还要提高。　（新华社）
