　　When Will It End?
　　To the Editor:
　　The Yi County People's Court in Hebei Province has been handling the case of counter-revolutionary criminal Wang Jinxi for six years without a resolution. No one knows when it will finally conclude.

　　Wang Jinxi joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1944. In September 1946, he defected and joined Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang secret service, serving as an intelligence station chief, specializing in stealing information from our side. In March 1947, he betrayed and murdered our underground worker, Comrade Liu Ruixiang (a Communist Party member). In April and May of the same year, he also led Kuomintang bandit troops to attack Xia Baiyang and Xia Haogou villages in Yi County, harassing the masses. At the end of 1948, Wang remained hidden in rural areas, plotting to continue counter-revolutionary activities.

　　This heinous counter-revolutionary traitor fell into the people's net as early as March 1949. However, the Yi County People's Court only sentenced him to four years in prison. The local people, especially the relatives of the direct victims, firmly expressed their dissatisfaction with this "boundless leniency" and repeatedly demanded that the court retry the case. It was not until September 1949 that the Yi County People's Court replied to the complainants, saying, "It was decided in late July of this year to handle it separately. However, due to the large number of new cases, it has been delayed until now. The retrial and revised sentence will be conducted soon."

　　After receiving this reply, the complainants waited for the court's verdict, but after a year, there was no verdict. After two years, there was still no verdict. The complainants repeatedly urged the court, but the court always prevaricated and evaded the issue.

　　The complainants became impatient and had to submit their opinions to the higher-level People's Court. After inspection, the Baoding Special District Intermediate People's Court replied to the complainants on November 26, 1954, saying, "The Yi County People's Court's sentence of Wang to four years of imprisonment is indeed too lenient. It has now been changed to a death sentence, to be executed immediately, and has been sent to our court for review." However, nearly half a year has passed, and there is still no news of the revised sentence. It is said that because the facts have not been fully clarified, it has been sent back to the Yi County People's Court for retrial.

　　This case has been going on for six years since Wang was arrested in 1949. In order to make a correct judgment on a case, the People's Court must conduct repeated investigations, research, and verification of the facts. Due to the investigation and verification of the facts, there may be a slight delay in the judgment time, which is understandable. However, the Yi County People's Court has spent more than six years investigating Wang's case. Why haven't the facts been clarified after six years of investigation, research, and verification? How can people understand such procrastination, delay, and irresponsibility?

　　The People's Court is a tool to protect the interests of the people and suppress counter-revolutionaries. The staff of the People's Court must have a deep concern for the interests of the people and a high degree of class hatred for counter-revolutionary elements. Why don't the staff of the Yi County People's Court have such feelings? This bloody counter-revolutionary case has been delayed for six years without a conclusion. When will it finally end?

　　究竟拖到什么时候？编辑同志：
    河北省易县人民法院审理一件反革命罪犯王近喜案，拖了六年还没有解决，今后究竟要拖到什么时候才能终结，现在还不知道。
    王近喜在一九四四年参加中国共产党，一九四六年九月叛变，参加蒋匪军统特务组织，充当匪军情报站长，专门窃取我方情报；一九四七年三月出卖和杀害了我地下工作人员刘瑞祥同志（共产党员）；同年四、五月间又曾带领国民党匪军袭击易县下白杨、下蒿沟等村，扰害群众；一九四八年底，王犯仍潜伏农村，阴谋继续进行反革命活动。
    这个罪恶重大的反革命叛徒，早在一九四九年三月就落入人民的法网了。可是，易县人民法院只判处该犯四年的徒刑。当地人民群众尤其是直接被害者的亲属，对于这样“宽大无边”的判决坚决表示不服，曾一再要求法院重新审理。直到一九四九年九月，易县人民法院才答复控诉人说：“本年七月下旬决定另行处理。但是因为新的案件多，所以拖延到现在。最近就要进行审讯改判。”
    控告人接到这个答复后，静候着法院的判决，可是，等了一年，没有判决。等了两年，仍然没有判决。控告人多次向法院催问，法院每次都是支吾搪塞。
    控告人等得不耐烦了，只得向高一级的人民法院提出意见。保定专区中级人民法院检查以后，在一九五四年十一月二十六日答复控告人说：“易县人民法院判处王犯有期徒刑四年，确系过轻；现已改判死刑，立即执行，并已送我院复核。”可是，又过了将近半年，还是没有改判的讯息。据说因为事实还没有完全弄清，又发还易县人民法院重新审理去了。
    这个案子从一九四九年将王犯逮捕时起，到现在已经过了六个年头了。人民法院对一个案件作出正确的判决，必须反复的调查研究、核对事实，由于调查核对事实，在判决时间上不免稍有迟延，这是可以谅解的。但是，易县人民法院审理王犯所占有的时间已达六年以上，为什么经过六年的调查、研究和核对，还没有把事实弄清楚呢？像这样的拖拉迟缓、不负责任，人们又怎能谅解呢？
    人民法院是保护人民利益、镇压反革命的工具，人民法院的工作人员必须对人民的利益寄予深切的关怀，对于反革命分子必须有高度的阶级仇恨。为什么易县人民法院的工作人员却没有这样的心情呢？致使这一件血债淋淋的反革命案件拖了六年不能终结，到底要拖到什么时候才能终结呢？　向东
