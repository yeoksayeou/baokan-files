　　The Oroqen Autonomous Banner in Progress
　　A Visit

　　The Oroqen ethnic group is one of the smallest ethnic minorities in China, with a total population of about 2,200 people. Approximately 1,200 of them reside in Heilongjiang Province, and 953 are in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party's great ethnic policy, not only have the more populous ethnic minorities in the country implemented regional autonomy, but also the Oroqen ethnic group, the smallest in number and residing in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has implemented regional autonomy and enjoys the rights of being masters of their own affairs. In recent years, the Oroqen people have gradually shaken off the backward and impoverished state left over from the old society and embarked on the path of a happy life in the big family of the motherland.

　　The Oroqen Autonomous Banner of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established on October 1, 1951. It currently governs the three Nu Tuke (districts) of Gankui, Nuomin, and Tuozhaming, and seven Gao Lu (villages). The total population of the banner is 1,003, of which 798 are Oroqen people, accounting for about 80% of the total population of the banner. The autonomous banner has cultivated 34 Oroqen cadres, accounting for 33% of the cadres in the banner, holding leading positions in various aspects such as banner head, section chief, Nu Tuke Da (district head), and cooperative director within the autonomous banner. These cadres have played a significant role in completing the various tasks of the autonomous banner and closely connecting the Party with the masses.

　　In the past, the Oroqen people mainly relied on hunting for production. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the methods of production have changed. Now, in addition to hunting, they also pick fungus, plant vegetable gardens, and raise livestock according to the season. In 1953, the Autonomous Banner People's Government organized twelve hunters from the Nuomin and Gankui Nu Tuke to hunt in the Nuohe area of Butha Banner in a planned manner, and hunted a total of twelve deer, selling them for 5,000 yuan. The hunters happily said: "Organized hunting is less difficult and the best way to increase income." Therefore, in 1954, the hunters voluntarily organized thirty-five seasonal hunting groups, and a year-round hunting group emerged. Due to the improvement of production methods and the development of production, the income of the hunters has increased, their purchasing power has been continuously improving, and their living conditions have completely changed. Before liberation, they ate wild animal meat and wore animal skins all year round, and slept in leather tents at night. Now, they can often eat rice and white flour, and clothes made of various fabrics have replaced old leather clothes. With the continuous improvement and enhancement of production and life, hunters are generally demanding to settle down. Now the hunters of Nuomin Nu Tuke have completely settled down.

　　After the establishment of the autonomous banner, the Oroqen people had their own supply and marketing cooperative. The supply and marketing cooperative promptly supplied the hunters with the means of production and livelihood they needed, and purchased the hunters' local specialties at fair and reasonable prices. In the past, one gray squirrel skin could only be exchanged for a bowl of millet, but now it can be exchanged for fifteen kilograms of millet. In the past, one otter skin could be exchanged for a bag of white flour, but now it can be exchanged for five bags of white flour. The hunters will never again be subjected to the cruel intermediary exploitation of the "Anda" (merchants). They love the supply and marketing cooperative. Ninety-five percent of the hunters have bought shares, and the hunters of some Nu Tuke have all bought shares. Now the supply and marketing cooperative has increased from one to three, and its business is also developing day by day. In the first half of 1951, the supply amount expanded five times compared with 1950, and the supply items also increased from more than one hundred to more than four hundred. The purchase of local products such as fur and mountain goods in the first half of 1954 increased by more than double compared to 1951.

　　Historically, the Oroqen people have never had their own schools. After liberation, the government helped the Oroqen people establish a completely publicly funded primary school. Now there are more than one hundred students, and the number of children enrolled has reached more than 80% of school-age children. Twenty students in the banner have been promoted to middle school, and three are studying at the Central University for Nationalities in Beijing. Although the school teachers are currently not Oroqen, they basically teach in the Oroqen language. The autonomous banner is now training Oroqen teachers.

　　In 1951, the first health center appeared in the deep mountains and dense forests inhabited by the Oroqen people. This health center was expanded into a hospital in 1953. There are currently 23 medical personnel, an increase of 18 compared to when it was first established. The staff of the hospital vigorously carried out medical work and publicity and education. Infectious diseases such as measles, smallpox and typhoid, which were prevalent in the mountains in the past, have been basically controlled. With the development of health work, the old habit of women giving birth in the wild has also changed. In 1953, the hospital also trained and reformed old midwives, using new methods to deliver babies, greatly improving the survival rate of infants.

　　Under the leadership of the Party organization and the People's Government of the Autonomous Banner, Oroqen men and women laborers participate in fire prevention and forest protection work every spring and autumn fire prevention season. The awakened Oroqen people have changed the old habit passed down from their ancestors of "setting fires to find antlers and burning wasteland to attract animals," recognizing that temporary interests should be subordinate to long-term interests, and partial interests should be subordinate to overall interests, and understanding that they should protect the country's forest property. They often sing: "Chairman Mao is like the red sun, the Oroqen people have gained light, the forest is like our eyeballs, we wholeheartedly protect it." Now protecting the motherland's forests has become the common action of all Oroqen people.

　　前进中的鄂伦春自治旗
　　谊访
    鄂伦春民族是我国少数民族中人口最少的民族之一，共约有二千二百多人，分布在黑龙江省内的约有一千二百多人，在内蒙古自治区内有九百五十三人。在中国共产党的伟大的民族政策指导下，不仅国内人数多的少数民族实行了区域自治，就是聚居在内蒙古自治区境内的人数最少的鄂伦春民族也实行了区域自治，享受着当家作主的权利。几年来，鄂伦春人已逐渐摆脱旧社会遗留下来的落后贫困状态，在祖国大家庭里，走上了幸福生活的道路。
    内蒙古自治区鄂伦春自治旗成立于一九五一年十月一日。现辖甘奎、诺敏、托扎明三个努图克
  （区），七个高鲁（村）。全旗人口共一千零三人，其中鄂伦春人有七百九十八人，约占全旗人口总数的百分之八十。自治旗已培养出鄂伦春族干部三十四名，占全旗干部的百分之三十三，在自治旗内担任旗长、科长、努图克达（区长）、合作社主任等各方面的领导职务。这些干部在完成自治旗各项工作任务和密切党同人民群众的联系上起了极大的作用。
    鄂伦春人过去一向以打猎为主要生产。几年来在党和人民政府领导下，生产方法起了变化。现在除打猎外，并按季节采木耳、种菜园子、饲养牲畜等。一九五三年自治旗人民政府组织了诺敏、甘奎两个努图克的十二名猎手，有计划地在布特哈旗淖河一带打猎，共猎获鹿十二只，卖款五千元。猎民们高兴地说：“有组织的打猎困难少，是增加收入的最好办法。”因此一九五四年猎民们自愿组织了三十五个季节性的打猎小组，并出现了一个常年打猎小组。由于改进了生产方法，发展了生产，猎民们的收入增加了，购买力在不断提高，生活面貌也完全改变了。解放前，他们常年吃的是兽肉，穿的是兽皮，晚上睡在皮帐幕里。现在，他们经常可以吃到大米、白面，各种布料做的衣服代替了老皮衣。随着生产、生活的不断改善和提高，猎民们普遍要求定居。现在诺敏努图克的猎民已完全定居下来了。
    自治旗成立后，鄂伦春人有了自己的供销合作社。供销社及时地供应了猎民所需的生产和生活资料，用公平合理的价格收购猎民的土特产品。过去一张灰鼠皮只能换一碗小米，现在可以换到十五斤小米。过去一张水獭皮换一袋白面，现在可以换五袋白面。猎民永远不再受“安达”（商人）残酷的中间剥削，他们热爱供销合作社，百分之九十五的猎民入了股，有的努图克的猎民全都入了股。现在供销合作社已由一个增加到三个，业务也日益发展。一九五一年上半年供应额比一九五○年扩大了五倍，供应物品也由百多种增加到四百多种。一九五四年上半年收购的皮毛、山货等土产品比一九五一年增加了一倍多。
    历史上鄂伦春人民从来没有过自己的学校，解放后，政府帮助鄂伦春人成立了一所完全公费制的小学，现在已有学生一百多人，入学儿童已达到学龄儿童的百分之八十以上。全旗先后已有二十名学生升入中学，还有三名在北京中央民族学院学习。学校教员目前虽然不是鄂伦春族人，但已基本上用鄂伦春语言教学。自治旗现在正培养着鄂伦春族的教师。
    一九五一年在鄂伦春人聚居的深山密林中出现了第一个卫生所。这个卫生所一九五三年已扩大为卫生院。现有医疗人员二十三人，比刚成立时增加十八人。卫生院人员大力开展了医疗工作和宣传教育，过去在山林里流行的麻疹、天花和伤寒等传染病，基本上已被控制住了。随着卫生工作的开展，妇女到野外生小孩的旧习惯也改变了。一九五三年卫生院还训练改造了旧产婆，用新法给妇女接生，婴儿成活率大为提高。
    在自治旗的党组织和人民政府领导下，每年春、秋两季防火时期，鄂伦春的男女劳动力都参加了防火护林工作。觉悟了的鄂伦春人民改变了祖祖辈辈留传下来的“放火寻角，烧荒引兽”的旧习惯，认识到了暂时利益应当服从长远利益、部分利益应当服从全体利益的道理，懂得自己应该保护祖国的森林财产。他们经常唱着：“毛主席好比红太阳，鄂伦春人得到了光明，森林好比是我们的眼珠，我们一心一意好好保护。”现在保护祖国森林已经成了全体鄂伦春人民的共同行动。
