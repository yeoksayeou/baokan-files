Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 14th: The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued "Instructions on Concentrating Efforts to Rectify Agricultural Production Cooperatives" to all levels of organizations in the province. The instructions require the secretaries of Party committees at all levels to personally take charge, and to have full-time cadres dedicated to this work throughout the year, in order to run agricultural production cooperatives well and develop agricultural production. On April 28th, the secretary and deputy secretaries of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC, along with four other individuals, led cadres to various locations to convey and organize the implementation of this important measure.

There are now more than 100,500 agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province, with member households accounting for 38 percent of the total number of farm households. The instructions from the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC pointed out that the majority of these cooperatives meet the conditions for establishment, but because the establishment work was done relatively roughly, many cooperatives did not seriously implement the policies of voluntarism and mutual benefit. To rectify and consolidate so many cooperatives is by no means something that can be done in a short period of time. To this end, the Provincial Committee has decided to concentrate efforts to carry out rectification and consolidation work throughout the year, resolutely stopping development this year, and carrying out necessary contraction of those cooperatives that cannot be run well or are nominal, in order to lay a solid foundation for the future development of the cooperative movement.

The instructions emphasized that in order to implement the above policies, it is necessary to resolutely and correctly implement the policies of voluntarism and mutual benefit. First of all, for all cooperatives that can be consolidated, efforts should be made to consolidate them; for cooperatives that do not have sufficient conditions for establishment or have no conditions at all, those that should be made smaller should be made smaller, and those that should be closed down should be closed down; consolidate those members who voluntarily joined the cooperative, strengthen those members who are not very firm, and those members who still have concerns after education must be allowed to withdraw from the cooperative. The instructions require Party committees at all levels, especially Party organizations in districts and townships, to classify and rank existing cooperatives, and conduct rectification and consolidation in a guided and orderly manner according to specific conditions. Whether consolidating or rationally contracting, whether withdrawing from the cooperative or transferring to another group, it is necessary to conduct in-depth work among the peasants and conscientiously implement the policies of voluntarism and mutual benefit.

The instructions also put forward specific steps for rectification work, requiring that from now until the wheat harvest, the consolidation work, the transfer of groups, the withdrawal from the cooperative, and other work should be done well by leading agricultural production cooperatives to do a good job in production and conscientiously implement the policies of voluntarism and mutual benefit, and put the production of agricultural production cooperatives and the production outside the cooperatives on the right track. The instructions also require Party committees at all levels to formulate local plans for rectifying cooperatives and methods for phased implementation based on the specific conditions and conditions of the locality.

### 河北省决定全力整顿农业生产合作社

　　河北省决定全力整顿农业生产合作社
    据新华社保定十四日电　中国共产党河北省委员会最近向全省各级组织发出了“关于集中力量整顿好农业生产合作社的指示”。指示要求各级党委书记亲自动手，并有固定干部全年专职进行这一工作，以求办好农业生产合作社，发展农业生产。四月二十八日，中共河北省委员会书记、副书记等四人分别带领干部到各地传达并组织贯彻这一重要措施。
    河北省全省现在已有农业生产合作社十万零五百多个，入社农户占农户总数百分之三十八。中共河北省委员会指示指出：这些社大多数合乎建社条件，但由于建社工作作得比较粗糙，很多社没有认真贯彻自愿、互利的政策。要整顿和巩固好这许多社决不是短时期所能做好的。为此，省委员会决定集中力量全年进行整顿和巩固工作，今年坚决停止发展，并对那些无条件办好及有名无实的社进行必要的收缩，为今后合作化运动的发展打好坚实的基础。
    指示强调说：为了贯彻上述方针，必须坚决地正确地贯彻自愿互利政策。首先对于所有能够巩固的社要尽力巩固起来，对建社条件不足或根本没有条件的社，应该化小的化小，应该停办的停办；巩固那些自愿入社的社员，坚定那些不太坚定的社员，对经过教育仍有顾虑的社员必须允许其退社。指示要求各级党委，特别是区、乡中的党组织，应对现有社进行分类排队，根据具体条件有领导有秩序地进行整顿巩固。不论巩固或合理收缩，不论退社或转组，都需要对农民深入进行工作，认真贯彻自愿和互利政策。
    指示还提出整顿工作的具体步骤，要求从现在到麦收前，通过领导农业生产合作社搞好生产和认真贯彻自愿互利政策，作好巩固工作和转组、退社等工作，把农业生产合作社的生产和社外的生产都纳入正轨。指示并要求各级党委根据当地的具体情况和条件，制定出当地整顿社的计划和分期执行的办法。
