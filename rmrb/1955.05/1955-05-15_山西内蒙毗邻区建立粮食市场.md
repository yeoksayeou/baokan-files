Establishment of Grain Market in Shanxi-Inner Mongolia Adjacent Area

In accordance with the needs of the economic life of the people in the Yanbei Special District of Shanxi Province and the Pingdiquan Administrative Region of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, it was agreed to establish twelve primary rural grain markets in the nine counties adjacent to the two regions. This has opened up an active economic path for farmers in both regions. Farmers in the Yanbei Special District can continuously obtain the grain they need from the Pingdiquan Administrative Region, and the timber, agricultural tools, and handicrafts needed by farmers in the Pingdiquan Administrative Region can also be fully supplied. This not only regulates the exchange of goods between farmers on both sides but also consolidates the unity between ethnic groups, eliminates the black market, and stabilizes grain prices. The Yanbei Special District has now sent working groups to Youyu, Zuoyun, Daren, and other five counties to carry out market arrangements and management. (Zhou Yong'an)

　　山西内蒙毗邻区建立粮食市场
    山西省雁北专区和内蒙古自治区平地泉行政区，根据两地群众经济生活的需要，商议定在两个地区毗邻的九个县份中，建立十二处农村粮食初级市场。这给两地农民开辟了一条活跃经济的道路。雁北专区农民即可源源不断地从平地泉行政区得到自己所需要的粮食，平地泉行政区农民所需要的木材、农具、手工业品也可得到充分的供应。这样既调剂了双方农民的有无，又巩固了民族间的团结，消灭了黑市和稳定了粮价。现在雁北专区已派出工作组前往右玉、左云、大仁等五县，进行市场的安排和管理工作。（周永安）
