　　Pay Attention to Selecting and Educating Animal Keepers in Agricultural Cooperatives
　　Zhou Siping Jian Hong
　　Many agricultural production cooperatives have implemented methods of private ownership of draft animals with public feeding and use, or public ownership through price evaluation. In these cooperatives, draft animals are collectively raised. Because people still lack the habit and experience of collectively raising and using draft animals, lack collectivist thinking, and lack necessary systems for the care and management of draft animals, many cooperatives have experienced the death and emaciation of draft animals. In order to protect the collectively raised draft animals of agricultural production cooperatives, in addition to stipulating reasonable systems for usage and educating all members to cherish collective interests, it is also necessary to pay special attention to selecting animal keepers, regularly educating animal keepers, and correctly determining the remuneration for animal keepers.
　　When the Second Agricultural Production Cooperative of Hanjia Ying Township, Fengzhen County, Inner Mongolia, was established this year, the draft animals were thin and weak, and some cattle had to be helped to get up after lying down. Seeing this situation, the members were very worried, and some even wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. Farmers outside the cooperative were also disappointed in the cooperative. Some people sarcastically said, "Just watch, they will either be sold or eaten as beef!" The township branch, the Party小组 within the cooperative, and the cooperative's management committee were not daunted by this difficulty. They fully utilized the superiority of the agricultural production cooperative to overcome the difficulties. The draft animals of this cooperative have all gained weight, enabling spring plowing production to proceed smoothly, not only ensuring more processing and timely sowing of land within the cooperative, but also helping farmers outside the cooperative to deliver manure and plant wheat. Through this incident, members and farmers outside the cooperative further recognized the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives. How did they improve the work of raising draft animals? First of all, they selected appropriate animal keepers. They exposed and criticized the animal keeper who was extremely irresponsible towards the draft animals and replaced him. At the same time, they selected appropriate animal keepers, organized a animal keeper team, and appointed Wang Heng, a poor peasant activist, as the team leader. Wang Heng had a higher level of awareness, was able to endure hardship and work hard, and was also good at uniting and educating other animal keepers, which played a significant role in improving animal husbandry. Since he became the animal keeper team leader, the animal husbandry situation quickly changed. They implemented a division of labor within the animal keeper team: three people were responsible for sixteen large cattle and two horses; two people were responsible for seven small cattle and three donkeys; an old man who could not do heavy work was specifically responsible for sifting grass, adding grass, and sweeping the yard; a particularly young and strong person was dedicated to doing heavy work such as carrying water and padding the pen. At the same time, the method of calculating remuneration for the animal keepers was further adjusted, and a reward system was stipulated. The branch, Party小组, and the cooperative's management committee also regularly conducted ideological education for the animal keepers and all members to cherish draft animals. All Party members, Youth League members, and core members within the cooperative took the lead in cherishing the cooperative's draft animals. The cooperative also held several animal keeper symposiums to improve the animal keepers' ideological awareness and animal husbandry techniques. They brought into play the power of the collective and each person's expertise, achieving: (1) the grass should be chopped short, dried in the sun, sifted clean, and carefully selected; (2) feed the animals on time and in quantity, adding grass frequently to ensure that the animals are full at every meal; (3) ensure the hygiene of the troughs and pens, clean the troughs three times a day, and frequently remove manure and pad the pens; (4) according to the strength of the animals and the weight of the work, appropriately adjust the feed at any time, and give more mixed feed to weak, sick, and heavily worked animals. After this cooperative carried out so much work in animal husbandry management, the phenomenon of irresponsibility towards animals was no longer seen, and examples of cherishing animals constantly appeared. Now, all agricultural production cooperatives in Fengzhen County are learning from their experience.
　　However, the animal husbandry management of many agricultural production cooperatives is not good, and the phenomenon of death and emaciation of draft animals is still very serious.
　　Some agricultural production cooperatives, when selecting animal keepers, only look at whether they have "animal husbandry experience" and "animal husbandry technology," and do not look at whether they cherish public interests and whether they are actively working. Therefore, most of the selected animal keepers are relatively wealthy farmers, and there are also some landlords, rich peasants, and people with political problems. Among the four animal keepers in Dongxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shulan County, Jilin Province, there was one landlord and one rich peasant; among the five "drivers" and "plowmen," there were three landlords and rich peasants. These landlords and rich peasants sneaked into the cooperative, pretended to be active, gained the trust of the members, and after taking up the position of animal keeper, used various covert ways to harm the cooperative's draft animals. In the stomachs of many animals that died in many cooperatives, things such as needles, nails, iron wires, iron sheets, stones, and broken glass were found, which was obviously a planned sabotage by class enemies. Some animal keepers, although not landlords or rich peasants, have a relatively strong self-serving ideology, not only disobeying leadership and not accepting new management experiences, but also extremely uncaring for public animals. Many animal keepers, finding it troublesome to get up at night, privately stipulate that they will not feed night grass. They tie the animals to the hitching post at night and then do not care about anything. As a result, some animals were kicked to death or miscarried due to fighting, some were strangled to death due to high troughs and short ropes, and some even froze to death. When they feed the animals, they try to save trouble and mostly feed "piles of grass," with cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys all fed together. Some animals that eat slowly and are relatively weak often do not get enough to eat. Some animal keepers also steal animal feed and take it home to feed pigs. The remaining feed in the animal troughs of some cooperatives becomes moldy and sour, but no one cares. Often the animal keepers do not even know when the animals are sick; some people know but ignore it. In Yongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuang'an Village, Jilin Province, one horse suffered from glanders, and it was not treated or isolated, resulting in fifteen horses being infected with glanders. Some cooperatives believe that anyone can do the work of raising animals, and in order to take care of semi-laborers, they assign some people who have no animal husbandry experience and are actually incompetent to be animal keepers. Wang Gui, the animal keeper of the Central Agricultural Cooperative in Shulan County, Jilin Province, is seventy-four years old this year, cannot carry water, and cannot do much labor. Nine tons of the ten tons of draft animals he feeds are underfed and under-watered.
　　Some agricultural production cooperatives have unreasonable treatment of animal keepers, which affects the enthusiasm of the animal keepers. Many of the cooperative's animal keepers have an attitude of "whether I work or not, it's three and a half points a day"; animal keepers mostly receive fewer work points than ordinary members. Therefore, some animal keepers believe that doing any work is better than doing animal husbandry work; being an animal keeper has no free time all year round, cannot sleep soundly at night, gets fewer points, and is also despised.
　　Cooperatives with these types of problems should quickly solve them. Those with inappropriately selected animal keepers should be replaced. The ideological education work for animal keepers should be strengthened; unreasonable remuneration should be adjusted. Class alien elements within the cooperative must be purged, and those with destructive behavior must be severely punished.

　　注意选择和教育农业合作社的饲养员
　　周思平　剑虹
    不少农业生产合作社实行了耕畜私有公喂公用或者折价归公的办法，这些社的耕畜都是集体饲养的。因为大家还缺乏集体喂养使用耕畜的习惯和经验，缺乏集体主义思想，缺乏对耕畜饲养管理的必要的制度，社里发生了不少耕畜死亡、瘦弱的现象。为了保护农业生产合作社集体饲养的耕畜，除了从使用方面规定合理的制度和对全体社员进行爱护集体利益的教育以外，还必须特别注意做好选择饲养员、经常地教育饲养员、正确地规定饲养员的报酬等工作。
    内蒙古丰镇县韩家营乡第二农业生产合作社，在今年开始成立的时候，耕畜又瘦又弱，有的牛卧下起来还得人扶。社员们看到这种情况，十分担心，有的社员甚至想退社了。社外农民看到这种情况，对社也很失望。有人讽刺地说：“瞧着吧，不是卖掉就是吃牛肉！”乡支部、社里的党小组和社务委员会并没有被这个困难吓倒，他们充分发挥农业生产合作社的优越性，克服了困难。这个社的耕畜都吃起膘来了，使春耕生产得以顺利地进行，不仅保证对社内土地多加工、及时播种，还帮助社外农民送粪、种麦。社员和社外农民，通过这件事情，进一步认识到农业生产合作社的优越性。他们是怎样改进了耕畜饲养工作的呢？首先是挑选了适当的饲养员。他们揭发和批判了对耕畜极不负责的饲养员，撤换了他；同时，选择了适当的饲养员，组织了饲养员小组，委派了贫农积极分子王恒担任小组长。王恒觉悟较高，又能吃苦耐劳，也善于团结和教育其他饲养员，对改进牲口饲养工作起了很大作用。自他担任饲养小组长后，牲口饲养情况很快就变了样。他们在饲养小组内实行了分工：三个人负责十六头大牛两匹马；两个人负责七头小牛三头驴，一个老汉不能做重活，专门负责筛草、添草、扫院子；特别年青力壮的一个人专做担水、垫圈等重活。同时，进一步调整了给饲养员计算报酬的办法，规定了奖励制度。支部、党小组和社务委员会还经常向饲养员和全体社员进行爱护耕畜的思想教育。全体党员、团员和社内的骨干分子以身作则，爱护社里的耕畜。社里还开了几次饲养员座谈会，提高饲养员的思想觉悟和饲养技术。他们发挥了集体的力量和各人的专长，做到了：（一）草要切得短、晒得干、筛得净、拣得仔细；（二）喂牲口按时按量、勤添草，保证牲口每顿都吃得饱；（三）保证槽、圈的卫生，每天清理三次槽，并勤起粪勤垫圈；（四）根据牲口强弱和做活轻重，随时适当调剂草料，对瘦弱有病和做了重活的牲口就多给拌点料。这个社在牲口饲养管理方面进行了这许多工作以后，再也看不到对牲口不负责的现象了，爱护牲口的事例不断地出现。现在，丰镇全县各个农业生产合作社正在学习他们的经验。
    但是，不少农业生产合作社耕畜饲养管理得不好，耕畜死亡、瘦弱的现象仍然很严重。
    有些农业生产合作社在选择饲养员时，光看是不是有“饲养经验”和“饲养技术”，而不看是不是爱护公共利益，是不是积极劳动；因此，所选的饲养员大部分是比较富裕的农民，并且还有一些地主、富农和政治上有问题的人。吉林省舒兰县董祥农业生产合作社的四个饲养员中，就有一个地主、一个富农；五名“车把式”、“犁把式”中，就有三名是地主、富农。这些地主、富农混进社里，假装积极，骗取了社员们的信任，担任了饲养员的职务以后，就用种种隐蔽的方式伤害社里的耕畜。在许多社死了的牲口肚里，都发现有针、铁钉、铁丝、铁片、石头、碎玻璃片等东西，很明显是阶级敌人有计划地在进行破坏。有些饲养员，虽然不是地主、富农，但自私自利的思想比较浓厚，不但不服从领导，不接受新的管理经验，而且对公共的牲口极不爱护。有许多饲养员嫌晚上起来麻烦，就私自规定不喂夜草。到晚上把牲口往拴马杆上一拴，便什么也不管了。因此，有的牲口因打架被踢死了、流产了，有的因槽高牵绳短被勒死了，还有冻死的。他们喂牲口时图省事，大都是喂“堆草”，牛、马、骡、驴都在一起喂；一些吃草慢和比较弱的牲口，经常吃不饱。还有些饲养员，把牲口饲料偷回家去喂猪。有些社的牲口槽里残剩的饲料发霉变酸了，也没人管。往往牲口病了饲养员还不知道；有的人知道也不理会。吉林省双奄村永兴农业生产合作社有
  一匹马害了鼻疽病，不给治疗也不隔离，结果十五匹马都染上了鼻疽。还有些社认为饲养牲口的工作谁都干得了，为了照顾半劳力，竟分配一些毫无饲养经验、实际上不能胜任的人去担任饲养员。吉林省舒兰县中心农业社的饲养员王癸，今年七十四岁了，挑不动水，也不能多劳动，他喂的耕畜十吨就有九吨吃不饱、饮不足。
    有些农业生产合作社对饲养员的待遇不合理，影响了饲养员的工作积极性。许多社的饲养员抱着“干不干，一天三分半”的态度；饲养员大都比一般社员得的劳动工分少。因此，有些饲养员认为：做任何活都比做饲养工作强；做饲养员一年到头没个闲，晚上不能睡个安稳觉，得分又少，还受人轻视。
    有这类问题的社，应当赶快加以解决。饲养员选择不当的，应当撤换。对饲养员的思想教育工作应当加强；报酬不合理的应当调整。对于社内的阶级异己分子必须加以清洗，对于有破坏行为的必须严加惩办。
