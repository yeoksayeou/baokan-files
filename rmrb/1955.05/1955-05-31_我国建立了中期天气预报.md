China Establishes Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
    The medium-range weather forecast established through the cooperation of the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Central Meteorological Bureau is a new achievement of China's meteorological science in serving economic construction.

    In the past, China could only forecast weather changes within the next twenty-four to thirty-six hours—that is, short-term weather forecasts. Scientific workers at the Institute of Geophysics and the Central Meteorological Bureau learned from advanced Soviet experience and began forecasting dangerous weather such as cold waves, frosts, and rainstorms, as well as summer precipitation amounts for the next three to seven days. This type of medium-range weather forecast allows people to have sufficient time to take preventive measures against dangerous weather. Flood control headquarters, hydropower stations, salt fields, fishing grounds, transportation systems, and basic construction sites all need to rely on medium-range weather forecasts to prevent dangerous weather.

    At the meteorological conference held in Hungary last October, meteorologists from the Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland, and many other countries believed that the research of Chinese scientists was successful, and the medium-range forecast of summer precipitation was a new achievement in medium-range weather forecasting.

　  我国建立了中期天气预报
    中国科学院地球物理研究所和中央气象局合作建立的中期天气预报，是我国气象科学服务于经济建设的一项新的成就。
    过去我国只能预报未来二十四小时到三十六小时内的天气变化——即短期天气预报。地球物理研究所和中央气象局的科学工作者学习了苏联先进经验，开始进行了未来三天到七天中的寒潮、霜冻、暴雨等危险天气和夏季降水量的预报。这种中期天气预报可以使人们对危险天气能有较充分的时间来进行防范措施，像防汛指挥部、水电站、盐场、渔场、运输系统和基本建设工地等都需要根据中期天气预报来防范危险天气。
    去年十月在匈牙利召开的气象会议上，苏联、匈牙利、波兰等很多国家的气象学家都认为中国科学家的这项研究是有成绩的，而夏季降水量的中期预报更是中期天气预报业务的一项新成就。
