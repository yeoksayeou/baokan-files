　　Harbin people are actively participating in voluntary labor to build their city. From April 18th to the end of July, the city's people will use 400,000 workdays to reinforce the Songhua River embankment, plant 310,000 trees, and renovate the parks. On May 6th, staff members from the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and other organizations exceeded their original voluntary labor plan by 100%.

　　Over the past two years, the people of Harbin have already used 1.4 million workdays of voluntary labor to build high embankments on both sides of the Songhua River, thus defeating the largest flood in twenty years in 1953. They have also doubled the size of Stalin Park.

　　哈尔滨人民积极参加义务劳动
    哈尔滨市人民积极参加义务劳动，建设自己的城市。从四月十八日到七月底，全市人民将用四十万个工来加固松花江堤，植树三十一万株，并对公园进行整修。五月六日，中共黑龙江省委机关等的工作人员，义务劳动的成绩超过原定计划一倍。
    过去两年来，哈尔滨市人民已经用一百四十万个工的义务劳动，在松花江两岸高筑起江堤，因而在一九五三年战胜了二十年来最大的洪水。他们还把斯大林公园扩大了一倍。
