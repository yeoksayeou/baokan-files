　　Heilongjiang Province is building a winery in Shangzhi County that will use the wild grapes abundant in the local mountain and forest areas as raw materials. This winery will not use grain for winemaking, and the auxiliary materials—sugar and alcohol—will be supplied by three beet sugar factories in the province. Therefore, the cost of the wine will be relatively low.

　　This winery is being built on the site of a dilapidated brewery, requiring less investment. At present, the construction of underground wine cellars and boiler rooms has begun, and it is expected to be completed and put into production in 1956. At that time, the factory will produce millions of bottles of wine annually. The sideline income of local farmers collecting wild grapes for the factory during the agricultural slack season will be more than 100,000 yuan per year. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 黑龙江省兴建一座葡萄酒厂

　  黑龙江省兴建一座葡萄酒厂
    黑龙江省尚志县正在兴建一座利用当地山林地区盛产的野葡萄作原料的葡萄酒厂。这个葡萄酒厂酿酒时不用粮食，辅助原料——砂糖和酒精将由省内三个甜菜制糖厂供给。因此酒的成本较低。
    这座葡萄酒厂是利用一个破旧的啤酒厂的厂址建设的，投资较少。现在，地下酒窖和锅炉房等工程已经开始建筑，预计到一九五六年就能完工并投入生产。那时，这个厂将年产数百万瓶葡萄酒。当地农民利用农闲季节为这个厂采集野葡萄的副业收入，每年可在十万元以上。（新华社）
