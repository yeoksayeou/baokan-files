    Unmasking the Deceptive Cloak of the Hu Feng Clique
　　Mao Yisheng
    We scientific workers greatly appreciate literary works. They are an indispensable form of spiritual nourishment in our lives. They not only allow us to better appreciate the meaning of life and inspire our work enthusiasm, but also often provide inspiration from the author's artistic creations and intellectual wisdom, promoting progress in our scientific work. However, the time we can devote to appreciating literary works is very limited, so we hope that popular literary works will be beneficial to us and not contain toxins. Therefore, we attach equal importance and welcome both the ideological movement in the broad literary and art circles to criticize Hu Feng's subjective idealism and the criticism from all sides of Hu Shih's experimentalist idealism. I am a layman in literary theory and cannot directly participate in this battle, but this battle has played a leading role in launching a study movement against idealism in the scientific field, thus requiring us to pay special attention to its development in the literary and art circles.

    I am not familiar with Hu Feng's works. It was not until recently, when I read many articles in the newspaper criticizing his thought, that I saw excerpts from his articles for the first time. My first impression was that his articles were very difficult to understand. If it weren't for the explanations in the critical articles, I wouldn't have known what he was talking about. At first, I always thought that Hu Feng's thought could not be compared with Hu Shih's, as if there should be an essential difference between the "Two Hus." It was precisely for this reason that I regarded the criticism of Hu Feng's thought as a theoretical issue within the literary field, and I did not dare to delve into it with my level of understanding.

    Now, the inside story of Hu Feng has been revealed. His "self-criticism" and Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" were published in the newspaper at the same time. I read the "Materials" first, and then the "Criticism." Only then did I suddenly realize why I couldn't understand Hu Feng's articles at all: what he thought in his heart and what he wrote were completely different! No wonder his articles were always so ambiguous and confusing. This was exactly what Comrade Yang Xianzhen had foreseen; he had something to hide. Good, the deceptive cloak of Hu Feng and his clique has now been removed, and he is exposed in his true form!

    In his "self-criticism," Hu Feng used many tricky phrases such as "blurred," "confused," "obliterated," "neglected," and "violated" to show his "petty-bourgeois revolutionary nature and stand," to show how he was in "rationality," how he was in "actual feelings," and to show that he was "seeking effective practical ways to open up the people's path in his own situation." This was to try to deceive people into believing that he was still a member of the revolutionary ranks. He used many roundabout phrases to make people believe that he was by no means a reactionary figure like Hu Shih. However, in his "criticism," he said, "That seems to be resisting the darkness, but also resisting collectivism," isn't this his anti-Party sentiment about to burst forth? As for the various ugly faces revealed in Shu Wu's "Materials," there is no need to repeat them. Since he is so anti-Party and anti-Marxist, he still says that he has the revolutionary nature and stand of the petty bourgeoisie. He is simply insulting the revolutionary elements of the petty bourgeoisie. What I am most indignant about is seeing him use all kinds of vicious words to express his hatred for the Party and progressive writers. Yet he still says: "If it weren't for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I would not have found a place to live in the past twenty years." What he really meant was "people always have to 'have others support them'." He is so despicable that he has actually embarked on the road of counter-revolution!

    Seeing through Hu Feng after his cloak has been removed should make us scientific workers very vigilant. Although our scientific work is not as easy as his to wear a progressive cloak and sell poison, because scientific language does not allow ambiguity (Hu Feng himself said that his language is not scientific), the process like his of becoming more and more reactionary due to unstable stand, unclear concepts, and increasing criticism is very shocking. Our scientific work has a huge impact on the people, just like literary and artistic work. We must take Hu Feng as a warning, strengthen our study, master and consolidate the scientific worldview, and under the leadership of the Party, persist in the struggle against bourgeois ideology for a long time!

    揭下胡风派的骗人的外衣
　　茅以升
    我们科学工作者是非常喜爱文艺作品的。它是我们生活中不可缺少的精神食粮，它不但使我们更好地领略人生意义来鼓舞工作热情，而且从作者的艺术创造和思想智慧里，还经常得到启示，推动我们在科学工作上的进步。然而我们所能欣赏文艺作品的时间是很有限的，这就希望流行的文艺作品都能对我们有益而不致含有毒素。因此，我们对广大文艺界批判胡风主观唯心主义的思想运动和各方对胡适的实验主义唯心观点的批判，是同样重视同样欢迎的。我对文艺理论是门外汉，不能直接参加这场战斗，但这场战斗对于在科学领域内展开反对唯心主义的学习运动，是起了带头作用的，因而就要求我们特别注意它在文艺界中的发展。
    我对胡风的作品是不熟悉的，直到最近在报上读到不少关于他的思想的批判文章，这才使我初次看到他的文章的摘录。我第一个印象便是他的文章非常难懂。要不是靠那批判文章的解释，我竟不知道他说的是什么。起初我总以为胡风的思想不能和胡适的相比，好像他们“二胡”之间，是应当有着本质上的区别似的。也正由于这个原因，我对胡风思想的批判，也就认为是文艺领域内的理论问题，以我的水平，也就不敢去深入研究。
    现在，胡风的内幕揭穿了。他的“自我批判”和舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”在报上同时发表了。我是先看“材料”，后看“批判”的。这才使我恍然大悟，为何我竟看不懂胡风的文章，原来他心中想的和笔下写的完全不是一回事！怪不得他的文章总是那样词意闪烁，使人头昏。这正被杨献珍同志预见到了，他是有不可告人之隐的。好了，胡风和他的一派的骗人的外衣现在是揭下来了，他赤裸裸地现出原形了！
    胡风在他的“自我批判”里，用了许多“模糊了”“混淆了”“抹煞了”“忽视了”“违反了”等等一连串的花招词句，来表明他的“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”，表明他在“理性上”如何如何，“实际感受上”如何如何，表明他是“在自己的处境里面寻求有效的实践方式去开拓人民底道路”。这是为了想骗人相信他总还不失为革命队伍中的一分子。他用了许多转弯抹角的词句，为了想使人相信他绝不是胡适一流的反动人物。然而他在“批判”里说，“那看来好像是反抗了黑暗，但同时也抵抗了集体主义”，这不是他的反党情绪呼之欲出吗？至于舒芜“材料”里所揭露出的他的种种丑恶面貌，那更不必赘述了。他既然这样地反党反马克思主义，却还说他有小资产阶级的革命性和立场，他简直是侮辱了小资产阶级的革命分子。我最愤慨的是看到他用尽了恶毒字句来表示他对党和进步作家的憎恨。然而他还说：“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的”。他实在的意思是“人是总得‘拿别人养活自己的’”。他这样的卑劣，他竟然是走上反革命的道路了！?
    看穿了揭去外衣的胡风，真够使我们科学工作者十分警惕。我们科学工作虽然不容易像他那样披着进步外衣，贩卖毒害，因为科学语言是不容含糊闪烁的（胡风自说，他的用语没有科学性），然而像他那样由于立场不稳、观念不清、愈受批判、愈趋反动的过程，是非常令人触目惊心的。我们的科学工作对于人民，和文艺工作一样，是有巨大影响的。我们必须以胡风为戒，加强学习，掌握和巩固科学的世界观，在党的领导下，长期坚持不懈地，同资产阶级思想作斗争！
