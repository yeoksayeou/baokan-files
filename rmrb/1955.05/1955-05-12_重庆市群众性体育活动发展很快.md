　　Mass sports activities are developing rapidly in Chongqing
    Mass sports activities are developing rapidly in factories, schools, and government offices throughout Chongqing. Currently, all government offices and factories and mines with more than one hundred people regularly do calisthenics to music, and there are more than 1,500 basketball and volleyball teams. Sixty-two secondary schools and above have implemented the Level 1 Labor-Defense System or the preparatory level of the Labor-Defense System, with more than 47,000 students participating in exercise. More than sixty exercise groups have been established in the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee's directly affiliated departments and the Municipal Public Security Bureau, with more than 600 participants.
    After participating in regular physical exercise, people's weight has generally increased. In a factory's apparatus exercise group, after more than a year of exercise, the average weight of each person increased by five jin (approximately 2.5 kg), and arm strength and grip strength also increased. More than forty students in the construction class of Chongqing Institute of Architecture and Engineering had over twenty people who were unable to work due to illness when they went to the construction site for internship the year before last; after exercising at the preparatory level of the Labor-Defense System, no one in the class was ill when they interned in a certain place in the Northwest last year.
    The sports skills of young people have also improved rapidly. Among the 18,000 people who participated in the Labor-Defense System preparatory level test in 1952, only 39% reached the passing standard or above; in the 1954 test, the number of those reaching the passing standard or above had increased to 74%. In the forty-three sports competitions held from 1954 to the present, forty athletes broke twenty-nine Chongqing city records.
    Military sports activities have also been greatly developed. Throughout the city's factories, schools, and government offices, thousands of people have participated in parachute jumping; more than a dozen schools have established parachute jumping groups. Many young people have mastered the technique of parachute tower jumping. At present, more than twenty schools in the city have established aviation model groups, and more than eight hundred students regularly participate in the production and research of aviation models. Many young people also actively participate in military sports activities such as camping, shooting, motorcycle driving, mountain climbing, and marching. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　重庆市群众性体育活动发展很快
    群众性的体育运动在重庆各工厂、学校和机关中迅速发展。目前，全市各机关和一百人以上的厂矿都经常做广播体操，篮、排球队已发展到一千五百队以上。六十二所中等以上学校推行了劳卫制一级或劳卫制预备级，参加锻炼的学生有四万七千多人。重庆市人民委员会直属机关和市公安局已有六十多个锻炼小组，参加的人数达六百多人。
    人们参加了经常性的体育锻炼后，体重普遍增加。某工厂的器械操锻炼小组，经过一年多的锻炼，平均每人体重增加五斤，臂力和握力也都增加了。重庆建筑工程学院施工班的四十多名学生前年到工地实习时，有二十多人因病不能工作；经过劳卫制预备级的锻炼，去年在西北某地实习时，全班没有一人生病。
    青年们的运动技术水平也提高得很快。一九五二年参加劳卫制预备级测验的一万八千人中，只有百分之三十九达到及格以上的标准；一九五四年测验时，达到及格以上标准者已增加到百分之七十四。一九五四年到现在曾经举行的四十三个运动项目的比赛中，有四十位运动员打破了二十九项重庆市的最高纪录。
    军事体育活动也有很大开展。全市工厂、学校和机关中，已有上千人参加了跳伞运动；有十几个学校建立了跳伞运动小组。不少的青年已掌握了伞塔跳伞技术。目前全市还有二十多个学校建立了航空模型小组，有八百多个学生经常参加航空模型的制作和研究工作。许多青年还积极地参加野营、射击、驾驶摩托车、爬山和行军等军事体育活动。（新华社）
