The first modern Jiamusi Copper Mesh Factory, serving the paper-making industry, is being built on the Mongol grassland on the south bank of the Songhua River in Heilongjiang Province. All civil construction work of the copper mesh factory was basically completed on May 1. Installation workers began installing machinery here in November 1954. As of May 1 this year, they had completed 80 percent of the total installation tasks. Various important equipment such as pipelines, cranes, and wire drawing machines have been installed and have already begun local trial operations.

The installation workers had never seen modern copper mesh manufacturing machines before. The members of the Wei Jinwen Youth Installation Group actively organized technical learning to ensure the smooth completion of the installation task, studied drawings together, and consulted experts and technicians when they encountered difficulties, thus gradually mastering the complex installation techniques. In April, they originally planned to complete the installation of the weaving machine in thirteen days, but they completed it in only eleven days.

　  第一座现代化铜网厂将建成
    在黑龙江省松花江南岸的蒙古力草原上，矗立起了我国第一座现代化的为造纸工业服务的佳木斯铜网厂。铜网厂的全部土木建筑工程，已经在五月
  一日基本完工。安装工人们从一九五四年十一月间开始在这里安装机械，到今年五月一日为止，完成了全部安装任务的百分之八十，各种管道、吊车、拔丝机等重要设备已经安装完毕，并已经开始进行局部试运转。
    安装工人们以前从没看见过现代化的制造铜网的机器。魏晋文青年安装小组的组员们，为了保证安装任务顺利完成，积极组织技术学习，一起研究图纸，有了困难就请教专家和技术员，因而渐渐掌握了复杂的安装技术。四月份他们原计划用十三天的时间把织网机安装完毕，结果只用了十一天。
