　　Sichuan-Kang Forest Industry Moving Forward
　　Yu Fan
    The forest resources of the Southwest region have always been called the second largest in the country, and the two provinces of Sichuan and Kang, in particular, are regarded as areas where forests are concentrated. However, no historical data in the past has provided an accurate figure, because none of the people who compiled these materials had ever entered the heart of these virgin forests. Since the Kuomintang reactionary government did not want to clarify these resources, nor did it have the power to develop and utilize them. When they needed timber, they plundered scattered forests near cities and along the banks of large rivers, causing serious soil erosion in these areas and losing their function of regulating the climate. For example, a virgin forest near Wenchuan, upstream of the Minjiang River, was severely damaged because transportation was relatively convenient. Countless mountain forests were cut into bald patches, only the middle section of the trees was taken, and the rest was left in the mountains to rot, causing germs to infect healthy forests and causing a large number of trees to wither and die. To this day, the slopes on both sides of the upper reaches of the Minjiang River often collapse and injure pedestrians and horses. Although forest areas with inconvenient transportation were not damaged, they were left unattended for a long time and left to their own devices. The forests were full of bamboo and weeds, and the young trees were covered, unable to get sunlight, and developed poorly, making them prone to aging and death. The decay rate of some forests in northwestern Sichuan reached 50 percent.
    After liberation, the first task before the Party and the People's Government was to save these dying forests as soon as possible, and to quickly find out the forest resources, and make timber supply plans based on the resource situation, so that timber could be delivered to various construction sites in a timely manner to ensure the smooth progress of basic construction. To this end, the Southwest Logging Corporation (now reorganized into the Sichuan-Kang Forest Industry Administration) was established at the end of 1950.
    For more than two years, all employees of the Sichuan-Kang Forest Industry Department have been working hard to complete the tasks assigned to them by the Party and the people.
    As the vanguard of the forest industry, the forest survey team was quickly established. Within two years, the survey team continued to grow, and the current number of survey personnel has expanded tenfold compared to the original. Large groups of young forest surveyors went deep into many virgin forest areas. The thousands of monkeys in the forest were therefore greatly surprised and began to disturb them; the survey personnel traveled back and forth in the bitter cold snow in winter and were immersed in the rain in summer. Each time they came back from the survey, they brought back large stacks of charts and figures. Based on these figures, they will draw many green marks on the map of the motherland. In the history of our motherland, no one has been able to draw these green marks with as much confidence as they do. In just one forest area in northwestern Sichuan, they have identified a large amount of resources, which, if calculated based on the current timber production in the entire Sichuan-Kang region, would be enough for logging for twenty years.
    Following the survey team into the virgin forests were a large number of logging and transportation workers. They came from all directions, including Han, Tibetan, and Qiang people. These logging and transportation workers have also been increasing year by year. Today, tens of thousands of people live and work in the forests. They felled one forest after another and transported the timber from the mountains to Chengdu and Chongqing. In the past two years, the construction timber they produced can build 5 million square meters of houses; the railway sleepers they produced can pave more than 700 kilometers of railway, ensuring the on-schedule opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and ensuring the smooth construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway; the utility poles they produced can erect power lines along 1,000 kilometers of highways; the bridge timber they produced can build hundreds of large bridges, making the Chengdu-Aba Highway and other highways in Sichuan Province unimpeded; the pit props they produced can supply the needs of producing 2 million tons of coal, enabling several large coal mines in Sichuan Province to produce normally. Whenever the news of the completion of these constructions, which are related to their labor and flesh and blood, reached the forest area, the workers received the greatest comfort.
    The development and utilization of forests and the nurturing and renewal of forests are carried out one after another. The workers cut down the dead and rotten wood to prevent them from becoming the main body of disease transmission; they picked the prime-age wood and sent it to the country; they left the most beautiful, straight, and healthy trees to reproduce; they cleared the weeds and branches in the forest so that large areas of young trees could grow vigorously. This enables the harvested forest to continuously supply timber to the country's construction. This step of work in the northwestern Sichuan forest area is all done by Tibetan and Qiang workers. With the help of veteran Han workers, they mastered the production technology in a few weeks. In the past year, they cleared and nurtured tens of thousands of mu of forest logging sites.
    With the development of production, a new life has been established. In the virgin forests that have never been seen, banks, post offices, consumer cooperatives, public canteens, hospitals, clubs, and libraries have been established one after another. On rest days, these places are crowded with people, and the central locations of several forest areas have quickly become prosperous towns. In the case of inconvenient transportation and difficult supply, under the leadership of the Forest Industry Administration, the workers actively thought of ways to improve their lives. Various fresh vegetables were planted in the open spaces around the sheds, and fat pigs were raised in the pigsties. The workers also carried out cultural, recreational, and sports activities. Every basketball and volleyball game was crowded with hundreds of workers; film crews sometimes went to show movies to the workers.
    In a short period of two or three years, the face of the forests in Sichuan and Kang has been completely changed. At noon, when you stand on a high place and look, you can see smoke rising from the kitchens everywhere. The Tibetan transport teams pulling the lines are carrying various materials along the avenue to the logging area. The labor chants from all sides rise with the wind; at this time, you will think that the virgin forests now have owners, and the working class has conquered them with powerful hands.
    This year, in order to improve the level of enterprise management and better meet the needs of national construction timber, the Sichuan-Kang Forest Industry Administration has put forward to all employees the call to "consolidate and develop perennial operations, and steadily implement the operation plan." Thousands of grassroots groups in the Sichuan-Kang forest area are discussing and completing the daily operation plan, and studying the operation method of changing the "annual labor and quarterly timber" to the "year-round operation and seasonal timber." This is a fundamental production innovation. If this innovation is realized, it means that the Sichuan-Kang forest industry has more successfully gotten rid of the limitations of the natural environment and climatic conditions, more deeply grasped the laws of forest industrial production, shortened the capital turnover of enterprises several times, and provided a more reliable guarantee for the ever-increasing national demand for timber. At present, all activities of all employees in the forest area are striving to achieve this goal. (Attached picture)

　　川康森林工业在前进中
　　于凡
    西南区的森林资源一向被称为全国第二位，而川康两省，尤其被视为森林集中的地带。但过去的任何历史资料都没有一个确切的数字，因为编造这些资料的人就没有一个进入过这些原始森林的中心。国民党反动政府既然不想弄清这些资源，也没有力量开发和利用这些资源。他们要木材就掠夺城市附近和大河两岸的散生林，使这些地区的水土造成严重的冲刷，失去调节气候的作用。如岷江上游汶川附近的一片原始森林，因为交通比较方便，森林就受到严重破坏，无数山林被砍成了光头，树子只取中段，其余的部分就丢在山里任其腐烂，使病菌传染健康的森林，造成大批林木枯朽死亡。至今，岷江上游两岸的山坡经常垮岩和打死打伤行人马匹。交通不便的林区，虽然没有被糟蹋，但由于长期无人过问，听其自生自灭，林子里长满了丛竹和杂草，幼树被遮盖起来，得不到阳光，发育不良，容易衰老死亡。川西北有些林子的腐朽率达到百分之五十。
    解放后，摆在党和人民政府面前的第一个任务就是要尽快地挽救这些行将死亡的森林，并要尽快地摸清森林资源，根据资源情况作出木材供应计划，使木材能及时地送到各个建设工地，保证基本建设能够顺利进行。为此，在一九五○年底成立了西南伐木总公司（现在改组为川康森林工业管理局）。
    两年多以来，川康森林工业部门的全体职工在艰苦地完成着党和人民交给他们的任务。
    作为森林工业先锋的森林勘测队迅速成立了，两年之内勘测队伍不断壮大，目前勘测人员已较原来的扩大了十倍。大队的年轻森林勘测人员深入许多原始林区。林子里千百成群的猴子因此大为惊奇，开始骚扰不安；勘测人员们冬天来回在严寒的雪地里，夏天浸在雨里，每一次他们勘察回来，都带来大叠大叠的图表数字，根据这些数字，他们将在祖国地图上绘上许多绿色标记。这些绿色标记，在我们祖国历史上，还没有一个人能够像他们那样满有自信地绘上。仅仅在川西北的一个林区，他们就摸清了大量资源，这个资源，如果按目前川康全区木材生产量计算，可足供采伐二十年。
    紧跟着勘测队进入原始森林的是大批的伐木和运材工人。他们来自四面八方，其中有汉族也有藏族和羌族，这些伐木和运材工人也是一年年增加着。如今已有几万人生产和生活在林子里。他们采伐了一个林子又一个林子，将木材从山间运到成都和重庆。近两年来，他们生产的建筑用材可造五百万平方公尺的房屋；他们生产的枕木可铺七百多公里的铁路，保证了成渝路按期通车，保证了宝成路顺利向前修建；他们生产的电杆可在一千公里的公路旁架设电线；他们生产的桥梁材可修建数百座大桥，使成阿公路及四川省其他地区的公路能够畅通；他们生产的坑木能供出产二百万吨煤的需要，使四川省几个较大的煤矿能够正常生产。每当这些与他们劳动血肉相关的建设完成的消息传入林区时，职工们就得到了最大的安慰。
    森林的开发利用和森林的抚育更新是先后相接进行的。工人们砍去了枯老腐朽的木材，不让它们成为传染疾病的主体；采下了壮龄木材送给国家；留下了最美最直最健康的树子让它们繁殖；清除了林子里的杂草枝丫，让大片的幼树能够蓬勃生长。使这片采伐过的森林不久又可源源不断给国家建设输送木材。这一步工作，在川西北林区全部是由藏族和羌族工人做的，他们在汉族老工人的帮助下，几个星期内就掌握了生产技术，去年一年中，他们清理和抚育了一万几千亩的森林采伐迹地。
    随着生产的发展，新的生活建立起来了，在从来不见人迹的原始森林里，银行、邮局、消费合作社、公共食堂、医院、俱乐部、图书馆，一个接着一个设立起来了，每到休息的日子，这些地方的周围就挤满了人，几个林区的中心地点很快地就变成了繁荣的小镇。在交通不便，供应困难的情况下，在森林工业管理局的领导下，工人们积极想办法改善了自己的生活，工棚四周的空地上种着各种鲜菜，猪圈里喂着又肥又大的猪。工人们还开展了文化娱乐和体育活动。每次的篮球和排球比赛，都围满了几百工人；电影队有时还去给工人们放映电影。
    在短短的二、三年时间内，川、康森林的面貌已经完全改变了。中午时候，你站在高处一看，但见炊烟四起，牵着线的藏胞驮运队，驮着各种物资正沿着大道向伐区进发，四面的劳动号子随风而起；这时，你便会想到，如今的原始森林已经有了主人，工人阶级已经用有力的手征服了它们。
    今年，川康森林工业管理局为了提高企业管理水平，更好地满足国家建设用材的需要，向全体职工提出了“巩固和发展常年作业，稳步贯彻作业计划”的号召，川康林区上千个基层小组正在讨论和完成着每一天的作业计划，研究着将“全年劳动一季到材”的作业方式，改变为“长年作业分季到材”的作业方式。这是一个有着根本意义的生产上的革新，这一革新假如实现了，就意味着川康森林工业已经更为成功地摆脱了自然环境和气候条件的限制，更加深入地掌握了森林工业生产的规律，使企业的资金周转缩短了好几倍，使日益增长的国家对木材的需要有了更可靠的保证。目前，林区全体职工的一切活动正在为着实现这个目标而奋斗。（附图片）
