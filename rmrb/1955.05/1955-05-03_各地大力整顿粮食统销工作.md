Across the country, effective measures are being taken to continue to rectify the work of unified grain purchase and sales; in some places, grain sales have begun to decline after rectification.

(Report from our newspaper) Since the rectification of unified grain purchase and sales work began in various parts of Anhui Province in late March, grain sales have begun to decline. According to statistics, the province's grain sales in mid-April decreased by 7.8% compared with the first ten days of April. In the disaster area of Fuyang, the average daily sales in the first and middle ten days of April decreased by more than 700,000 jin compared with the average daily sales in late March. In Kai'cheng District of Wuwei County, after consultation, the masses who did not need to buy grain voluntarily returned 46 grain purchase certificates. According to statistics from four agricultural producers' cooperatives in Mofan Township, Qianshan County, more than 80 households of farmers who originally requested supplies no longer require them. In areas where rectification has been carried out, farmers' enthusiasm for production has increased, and sales volume can mostly be stabilized within the prescribed sales targets.

The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a meeting of county party secretaries held in mid-April, requested that all counties, based on local conditions, announce fixed sales figures to the masses before mid-May, mobilize the masses to democratically evaluate and classify grain surplus and deficit households, and rationally supply grain to grain-deficient and semi-grain-deficient households, in order to simultaneously eliminate the erroneous ideas of those farmers who are not deficient but claim to be. Since mid-April, most counties in the province have convened meetings of county, district, and township cadres. The Jinan and Wenzhou Prefectural Committees of the Communist Party of China also convened emergency meetings of the heads of finance and trade from various counties and cities to specifically deploy the rectification of unified grain purchase and sales work. Now, judging from the townships in the province where the rectification of unified grain purchase and sales work has begun, after taking the above measures, the unreasonable sales phenomenon in the unified grain purchase and sales work has been initially reversed. From April 10 to April 20, the average daily grain sales volume in the province decreased by 13% compared with the first ten days of April.

The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on April 29 to discuss the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on stepping up the rectification of unified grain purchase and sales work. The meeting studied some specific measures for rectifying unified grain purchase and sales work. Jiangsu has been rectifying unified grain purchase and sales work since March. So far, two-thirds of the townships in the province have carried out the rectification of unified grain purchase and sales work, and one-third of the townships are still in progress. In townships where the rectification of unified grain purchase and sales work has been carried out, the tense situation of unified sales has eased, and the quantity of grain supplied has generally decreased to varying degrees. The Provincial Party Committee meeting decided that in townships where the rectification of unified grain purchase and sales work has not yet been carried out or is in progress, efforts should be made to examine past unified sales work, seriously analyze the surplus and deficit situation, and formulate realistic sales targets for May and June before May 10. After discussion by the Communist Party branch, the targets should be announced to the masses. Townships that have already carried out the rectification of unified sales work must strengthen their work at any time, check to ensure that the original grain unified sales plan is not broken.

The Party committees and people's governments at all levels in Shandong Province have universally begun to rectify the work of unified grain purchase and sales. Since March, the amount of grain supplied to rural areas in Shandong Province has been increasing daily, breaking the rational targets set by the state. In response, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions in mid-April, requiring party committees at all levels to focus on spring ploughing production and the rectification and consolidation of agricultural producers' cooperatives, combined with the rectification of unified grain purchase and sales work, to ensure reasonable supply and stabilize farmers' production enthusiasm. After the instructions were issued, party committees at all levels actively organized forces to implement them. The Linyi, Tai'an, and Jining Prefectural Committees conveyed and deployed them at meetings of county party secretaries. The Dezhou, Huimin, and Jiaozhou Prefectural Committees issued specific instructions on rectifying the work of unified grain purchase and sales. The Liaocheng, Heze, and other five Prefectural Committees also dispatched responsible cadres to go deep into the countryside to help with the work.

Following the issuance of instructions on rectifying the work of unified grain purchase and sales on April 10, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an emergency meeting of the secretaries of the Communist Party committees on April 21, specifically discussing the rectification of unified grain purchase and sales work. In late April, the Henan Provincial People's Committee also issued a notice, announcing several specific regulations on the unified purchase and sale of grain. According to the above instructions, all counties will, on the basis of thoroughly implementing policies and mobilizing the masses, affirm the amount of grain needed by grain-deficient households before the wheat harvest, taking the township as a unit, and announce it to the masses. In order to enable all localities to correctly implement policies, the heads of the Communist Party committees in some areas have gone to the counties to assist in the work.

Shanxi Province has preliminarily rectified the work of unified grain purchase and sales. About 80% of the townships in the province can be supplied according to the original targets. In the past, Pianguan, Fanshi, Huo County, and other places blindly requested higher-level allocation supplies because cadres did not know the bottom line of grain sales. After inspection and rectification, some unreasonable phenomena such as false reporting, excessive claiming, and requesting less supply but demanding more, were corrected in time, and they can all maintain planned supply or have a slight surplus. Before the rectification of the unified grain purchase and sales work in Shanxi Province, about 10% of the grain supply certificates issued in various places were given to farmers who were not short of grain, and individual counties mistakenly issued grain purchase certificates to as much as 38% of the population. In the rectification of unified grain purchase and sales work, a preliminary handling has been made for those who falsely claimed, over-claimed, and mistakenly issued purchase certificates.

The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee from April 25 to April 29, with the participation of party secretaries from various prefectures, focusing on studying how to do a good job in the current rural grain unified sales work. The meeting believes that it is possible to carefully rectify the unified grain purchase and sales work, ensure the grain supply of grain-deficient households, and at the same time not break the grain sales targets allocated to Hunan Province by the state. The meeting required party committees at all levels to conduct a rectification of rural grain unified sales in conjunction with spring ploughing production, based on the different conditions in different regions. The meeting also required party committees at all levels to strengthen policy education for village cadres and correct the erroneous practice of average distribution in the grain unified sales work of some village cadres.

　　各地大力整顿粮食统销工作
    本报讯　各地正采取有效措施，继续整顿粮食统销工作；有些地方经整顿后，粮食销售量已开始下降。
    安徽省各地从三月下旬开始整顿粮食统销工作以来，粮食销售量已经开始下降。据统计，全省四月中旬粮食销售量比上旬减少百分之七点八。灾区阜阳四月上、中旬平均日销量，比三月下旬平均日销量减少七十多万斤。无为县开城区经过协商，不需要买粮的群众自动交回购粮证四十六张。潜山县模范乡四个农业生产合作社统计，有八十多户原来要求供应的农民，现在也不要求供应了。经过整顿的地方，农民生产情绪提高，销售量大部能稳定在规定的销售指标之内。
    中共浙江省委员会在四月中旬召开的县委书记会议上曾要求各县在五月中旬以前根据各地不同情况，向群众公布定销数字，发动群众民主评议划分粮食余缺户，把粮食合理地供应到缺粮户和半缺粮户的手中，以便同时消除那些不缺叫缺的农民的错误思想。自四月中旬以来，全省已有大部分县召开了县、区、乡干部会议，中共金华、温州地委还召开了各县、市财政、贸易负责人的紧急会议，具体部署整顿粮食统销工作。现在，从全省已开始整顿粮食统销工作的乡来看，采取上述措施后，初步扭转了粮食统销工作不合理的销售现象，四月十日到二十日，全省每日平均销粮数量，就比四月上旬下降百分之十三。
    中共江苏省委四月二十九日开会讨论国务院和中共中央关于加紧整顿粮食统销工作的指示，会议研究了整顿粮食统销工作的一些具体措施。江苏各地从三月份开始整顿粮食统销工作，到目前为止，全省已有三分之二的乡进行了整顿粮食统销工作，还有三分之一的乡正在进行。已做过粮食统销整顿工作的乡，统销紧张情况已趋缓和，粮食供应数量一般都有不同程度的减少。省委会议决定在尚未进行或正在进行整顿粮食统销工作的乡，都要无例外地争取在五月十日以前，通过检查过去的统销工作，认真分析余缺情况，订出切合实际的五、六两个月的销售指标，经中共党支部讨论后，把指标向群众公布。已经进行整顿统销工作的乡，仍须加强工作，随时检查，保证原订的粮食统销计划不被突破。
    山东省各级党委和各级人民政府，普遍开始整顿粮食统销工作。三月份以来，山东省农村粮食供应量逐日增大，突破了国家规定的合理指标。对此中共山东省委曾于四月中旬发出指示，要求各级党委以春耕生产和整顿巩固农业生产合作社为中心，结合整顿粮食统销工作，保证合理的供应，安定农民生产情绪。指示下达后，各级党委都积极组织力量来贯彻执行。临沂、泰安、济宁等地委在县委书记会议上作了传达部署。德州、惠民、胶州等地委发出了整顿粮食统销工作的具体指示。聊城、菏泽等五个地委并抽调负责干部深入农村，帮助工作。
    中共河南省委员会继四月十日发出关于整顿粮食统销工作的指示后，又在四月二十一日召开了中共地委书记紧急会议，专门讨论整顿粮食统销工作。四月下旬河南省人民委员会还发布了布告，公布粮食统购统销的几项具体规定。根据上述指示，各县将在深入贯彻政策、发动群众的基础上，以乡为单位，把麦收前缺粮户所需要的粮食数量肯定下来，并向群众宣布。为了使各地正确贯彻政策，有些地区的中共地委会负责人已到县里协助工作。
    山西省初步整顿了粮食统销工作，全省已有百分之八十左右的乡可按原订指标供应。偏关、繁峙、霍县等地原来因干部不摸粮食销售的底，盲目要求上级增拨供应量，经检查整顿后，及时纠正了一些虚报冒领和求少供多等不合理现象，都可保持按计划供应或略有节余。山西省粮食统销工作未经整顿前，各地所发粮食供应证约有百分之十左右给了不缺粮的农户，个别县错发购粮证达百分之三十八。各地在整顿粮食统销工作中，已对冒领、多领和错发购粮证的作了初步处理。
    中共湖南省委在四月二十五日到二十九日召开的有各地委书记参加的省委扩大会议，着重研究了如何做好当前农村粮食统销工作问题。会议认为认真整顿粮食统销工作，保证缺粮户的粮食供应，同时不突破国家分配给湖南省的粮食销售指标，是可以作得到的。会议要求各级党委根据不同地区情况，结合春耕生产，对农村粮食统销进行一次整顿。会议还要求各级党委加强对乡村干部的政策教育，纠正某些乡村干部在粮食统销工作上的平均分配的错误做法。
