　　Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd. People from all walks of life in the capital are enthusiastically visiting the Exhibition on Liberating Taiwan. In the two days of May 2nd and 3rd, more than 7,000 people visited, including cadres from government and military organizations, workers, students, and citizens. They carefully visited every part of the exhibition.
      The audience was very angry when they saw the various crimes of U.S. imperialism unreasonably occupying our Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique cruelly exploiting the people of Taiwan. Many viewers, after seeing the Taiwanese compatriots suffering from tortures such as "live skinning," "finger pricking," and "burning with fire paper" in the Chiang bandits' concentration camps, repeatedly condemned the Chiang bandits' inhuman crimes.
    When visiting the third part of the exhibition, the audience paid special attention to the photos of Premier Zhou Enlai speaking at the Asian-African Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on April 23, and the summary of his speech at the closing session of the Asian-African Conference on April 24. This summary of the speech was: "...The relaxation and elimination of the tense situation in the Taiwan area should be resolved by China and the United States sitting down for negotiations, but it cannot affect in the slightest the Chinese people's exercise of their sovereignty—the just demand to liberate Taiwan." These words left a deep impression on the audience.
    The audience crowded in front of the photos of the liberation of Yijiangshan Island. They showed excitement for the powerful strength and victorious achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　首都各界人民踊跃参观解放台湾展览会
    新华社三日讯　首都各界人民踊跃参观解放台湾展览会。二日、三日两天内，前往参观的群众有七千多人，其中有政府机关和军事机关的干部、工人、学生和市民。他们仔细地参观了展览会的每个部分。
      观众在看到美帝国主义无理霸占我国台湾和蒋介石卖国集团残暴地压榨台湾人民的种种罪行时，非常愤怒。许多观众在看了台湾同胞在蒋贼的集中营遭受着“活剥皮”“刺指头”“火纸烧”等酷刑时，都连声斥责蒋贼毫无人性的罪行。
    在参观展览会的第三部分时，观众特别注意到周恩来总理在亚非会议上发言的照片和周恩来总理在四月二十三日的声明以及四月二十四日在亚非会议闭幕会上的发言摘要。这个发言摘要是：“……台湾地区紧张形势的和缓和消除，应该由中国和美国坐下来谈判解决，但不能丝毫影响中国人民行使自己主权——解放台湾的正义要求。”这几句话给观众留下了深刻的印象。
    在解放一江山岛的照片前面，观众拥挤。他们为中国人民解放军的强大力量和胜利战果而流露出兴奋的神情。
