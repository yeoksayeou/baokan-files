　　Ministry of Higher Education Holds Symposium of University Presidents

　　From April 14th to 30th, the Ministry of Higher Education convened a symposium of university presidents from national higher industrial schools, comprehensive universities, and some higher agricultural and forestry and normal schools. The symposium focused on studying the issue of implementing the educational policy of all-round development in universities and colleges, resolving the excessive academic burden on students, and improving the quality of all-round development.

　　At the meeting, the university presidents stated that the situation of excessive academic burden on students in universities and colleges was quite serious. The meeting reviewed the issues of educational ideology in the past period and further clarified that the task of higher education is to cultivate cadres who not only have rich scientific and technological knowledge, but also have a high degree of political consciousness, noble moral character, cultural accomplishment, and a healthy physique; that is, to cultivate specialized talents loyal to socialist construction who are developed in an all-round way. It is required to resolutely implement the principle of "learn less, learn better" to improve quality. The university presidents analyzed that the reasons for the excessive burden on students come from many aspects, and the situations in various schools are also different. Therefore, the measures taken to solve this problem are not completely the same.

　　This symposium discussed the issue of improving and strengthening the political and ideological education of students. Every teacher must establish the idea of being fully responsible in educational work and closely combine business and technical education with political and ideological education through teaching activities and daily activities.

　　高等教育部召开高等学校校院长座谈会
    从四月十四日到三十日，高等教育部召集全国高等工业学校、综合大学和部分高等农林、师范学校的校院长举行座谈会，着重研究了关于高等学校贯彻全面发展的教育方针，解决高等学校学生学习负担过重，提高全面发展质量的问题。
    在这次会上，校院长们谈到高等学校学生学习负担过重的情况是相当严重的。会上，检查了过去一个时期的教育思想问题。并进一步明确了高等教育工作的任务是：培养不仅有丰富的科学技术知识，而且要具有高度的政治觉悟、高尚的道德品质、文化修养和健全体魄的干部，也就是培养全面发展的忠实于社会主义建设的专业人材。要求坚决贯彻“学少一点，学好一点”提高质量的原则。校院长们分析了造成学生负担过重的原因是来自多方面的，各校情况也不一样。因此，解决这个问题所采取的措施也不完全相同。
    这次座谈会讨论了改进和加强对学生的政治思想教育工作的问题。每个教师在教育工作中必须树立全面负责的思想，通过教学活动和日常活动，把业务技术教育工作和政治思想教育工作密切结合起来。
