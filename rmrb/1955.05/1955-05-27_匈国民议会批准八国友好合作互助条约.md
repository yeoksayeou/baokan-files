Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 26th: According to TASS, the National Assembly of the Hungarian People's Republic held a meeting on the 25th to discuss the ratification of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed in Warsaw.

　　Foreign Minister J. Boldoczki, on behalf of the Hungarian government, submitted the bill on the ratification of the Warsaw Treaty to the National Assembly for review.

　　Chairman of the Council of Ministers and head of the Hungarian government delegation to the Warsaw meeting, A. Hegedüs, made a report on the Warsaw meeting.

　　He pointed out that the Council of Ministers, considering that the Paris Agreements on the revival of German militarism have been approved, believes that it is correct to conclude the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance and to establish a joint command of the armed forces of the contracting states. The Hungarian people will never allow the freedom and independence they gained with the help of the Soviet Union to become objects of trade. They firmly oppose any such attempt.

　　When discussing the report, M. Rákosi, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, spoke. He said that people all over the world who hope for a happy and bright future for mankind welcome the Warsaw Treaty with great satisfaction. When the Hungarian people, headed by the Hungarian Working People's Party, ratify the Warsaw Treaty, they are prepared to take all necessary measures to crush the aggressive plans of imperialism.

　　After discussion, the National Assembly unanimously approved the Eight-Nation Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance. The deputies welcomed this decision with stormy and sustained applause.

　　匈国民议会批准八国友好合作互助条约
    新华社二十六日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利人民共和国国民议会二十五日举行会议，讨论批准在华沙签订的八国友好合作互助条约的问题。
    外交部长雅·波尔多奇基代表匈牙利政府，将关于批准华沙条约的法案提交国民议会会议审议。
    部长会议主席、出席华沙会议的匈牙利政府代表团团长安·赫格居斯作了关于华沙会议的报告。
    他指出，部长会议考虑到关于复活德国军国主义的巴黎协定已被批准，认为缔结友好合作互助条约以及成立缔约国武装部队联合司令部是正确的。匈牙利人民决不会让他们在苏联的帮助下获得的自由和独立成为交易的对象。他们坚决反对任何这种企图。
    在讨论报告时，匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会第一书记马·拉科西讲话。他说，全世界各地凡是希望人类有幸福和有美好的前途的人都十分满意地欢迎华沙条约。以匈牙利劳动人民党为首的匈牙利人民在批准华沙条约时，他们就准备采取一切必要的措施来粉碎帝国主义的侵略计划。
    国民议会经过讨论后一致批准了八国友好合作互助条约。议员们以暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声来欢迎这一决定。
