Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 16th. Various survey works in the Yellow River Basin for 1955 have been fully launched. Twelve survey teams comprising over 1,250 personnel have been dispatched to provinces and autonomous regions along the Yellow River, including Gansu, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia, to conduct topographic surveys and other tasks. Comprehensive geological surveys, hydrological investigations, geological drilling, topographic measurements, and surveys and measurements of river courses, forestry, regional economy, irrigation, and soil and water conservation have also fully commenced in the basins of the Yi River and Luo River, important tributaries of the lower Yellow River. This work is being carried out by 1,650 technicians concentrated by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the Ministry of Geology, the Henan Provincial Forestry Bureau, and other departments. In addition, geological drilling on the Jing River and Wuding River, investigations in the Qin River basin, flood surveys on the Yellow River main stream, and groundwater observation and analysis in the irrigation area east of Zhengzhou, west of Zhongmu, north of the Longhai Railway, and south of the Yellow River in Henan Province are also underway.

The comprehensive reconnaissance work jointly conducted by hydraulic and geological engineers in the Yi River and Luo River basins was completed in early May, and a reconnaissance work report has been prepared. This report proposes several dam sites suitable for reservoir construction. Topographic and geological personnel are now further conducting surveying, research, and comparison work.

These survey works are all collecting data for the first phase of the Yellow River development and management project. In the first phase, reservoirs will be built on the main stream, and reservoirs mainly for flood control and comprehensive utilization will be built on tributaries such as the Yi River, Luo River, and Qin River, to alleviate the threat of flood peaks caused by heavy rains in this area to the dikes of the lower Yellow River. The ongoing survey work in the Yi River, Luo River, and Qin River basins is collecting relevant data for the preparation of basin plans for these tributaries. The measurement and groundwater observation and analysis work carried out in some areas of Henan, Shandong, and Hebei provinces is collecting data for the planning and design of the irrigation area for the first phase of Yellow River water diversion irrigation.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 17th. The hydrological data of the Yellow River before 1953 has been compiled and analyzed for two years and three months, and has been successively printed this year. By early May, the data from the upper reaches of the Yellow River has been printed into volumes, and the data from the middle and lower reaches is also being successively printed.

These data include the water level, flow, sediment content, and sediment transport rate of the Yellow River main stream and its tributaries since 1919, when hydrological records began. Through these data, it can be seen the maximum and minimum floods of the Yellow River in previous years, as well as the monthly and annual changes in water level and flow, and the source of Yellow River sediment and its impact on riverbed changes. It is necessary data for planning and designing Yellow River management projects. At the same time, it also has great reference value for the industrial and agricultural construction in the Yellow River Basin.

    为开发和治理黄河第一期工程搜集资料
　　黄河流域的勘测工作全面展开
    新华社郑州十六日电　一九五五年在黄河流域进行的各项勘测工作已经全面展开。一千二百五十多人组成的十二个测量队已到黄河流域的甘肃、山西、陕西、河南、山东、河北等省和内蒙古自治区，进行地形测量等工作。黄河下游重要的支流伊河、洛河流域，也已全面开始进行地质勘察、水文调查、地质钻探、地形测量和河道、林业、区域经济、灌溉、水土保持等调查和施测工作。这一工作是由黄河水利委员会、地质部、河南省林业局等部门集中了一千六百五十名技术人员来做的。另外，泾河、无定河的地质钻探，沁河流域的查勘，黄河干流的洪水调查，河南境内郑州以东、中牟以西、陇海铁路以北、黄河南岸的灌区地下水观测分析工作，也正在紧张进行。
    水利、地质工程师在伊河、洛河流域共同进行的综合性踏勘工作，已经在五月初完成，并已作出踏勘工作报告。这个报告提出了可以修建水库的几处坝址。地形、地质等人员现在正进一步作施测、研究、比较工作。
    这些勘测工作都是为今后开发和治理黄河的第一期工程搜集资料。第一期工程干流将兴建水库，同时将在伊河、洛河、沁河等支流上兴建防洪为主、综合利用的水库，以解除这一区域因暴雨所造成的洪峰对黄河下游堤防的威胁。现在，正在进行的伊河、洛河、沁河流域的勘测工作，就是为编制这几个支流的流域规划搜集有关资料。河南、山东、河北等省部分地区所进行的测量和地下水观测分析工作，是为第一期引黄河河水灌溉的灌区规划设计工作搜集资料。
    新华社郑州十七日电　一九五三年以前的黄河水文资料，经过两年零三个月的整编分析之后，已在今年陆续付印。到五月上旬，黄河上游的资料已经刊印成册，中、下游的资料也正在陆续付印中。
    这些资料，包括了黄河干流和支流自一九一九年有水文纪录以来的水位、流量、含沙量和输沙率。通过这些资料可以看出黄河历年最大洪水、最小洪水以及水位、流量的逐月逐年变化和黄河泥沙来源以及对河床变化的影响等情况，是规划设计治黄工程的必要资料。同时对黄河流域的工业农业建设也有很大的参考价值。
