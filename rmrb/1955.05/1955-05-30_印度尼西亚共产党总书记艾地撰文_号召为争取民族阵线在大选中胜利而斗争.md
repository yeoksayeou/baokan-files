　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 26th: "Pravda" published an article by D.N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, entitled: "The Indonesian People's Struggle for Peace and the Victory of the National Front in the Upcoming General Election."
    The article states that at the end of September this year, Indonesia will elect 250 members of parliament; in mid-December, 500 members of the Constituent Assembly will be elected. This election will be of great historical significance for the Indonesian people, because they will, for the first time in history, independently decide what kind of government and what kind of constitution conforms to their wishes.
    The article says that at present, meetings are being held in factories, rural areas, schools, and government agencies throughout Indonesia to discuss issues related to the general election. Various government parties are also holding rallies across the country. Among the candidates of the Indonesian Communist Party, not only are there party members, but also 30 percent are non-party individuals who support the Communist Party's program. The Indonesian Communist Party supports the progressive measures of the current government led by Ali Sastroamidjojo, representative of the Indonesian National Party. The Indonesian Communist Party supports the policy of holding general elections, a foreign policy based on the principle of peaceful coexistence, a policy of granting a certain degree of freedom to the activities of the Communist Party and mass democratic organizations, and a policy of suppressing the so-called "Islamic Republic of Indonesia" and the terrorist gang "Darul Islam Movement," which were established and funded by Dutch and American imperialists.
    The article points out that imperialist countries, especially the Netherlands and the United States, are fully aware that if elections are held under the auspices of the current Indonesian government, their future in Indonesia will be completely bleak. Precisely because of this, Dutch and American imperialists are concentrating all their efforts to use Chiang Kai-shek elements and traitors among Indonesians to achieve the goal of overthrowing the current government.
    The article says that the Indonesian Communist Party and other democratic parties and groups are waging a tenacious struggle to thwart the sinister conspiracy of imperialists and traitors to overthrow the current government.
    The article concludes that for Indonesia to have a bright future, there is no other way than to ensure that the National United Front, in which the Indonesian Communist Party actively participates, achieves victory in the upcoming elections. The victory of the National Front in the upcoming elections will open up a broader future for the Indonesian people, inspiring them to fight for the elimination of Indonesia's current semi-colonial and semi-feudal status and for the complete national independence of the country.

　　印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地撰文
　  号召为争取民族阵线在大选中胜利而斗争
    新华社二十七日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：“真理报”刊载了印度尼西亚共产党总书记德·纳·艾地的一篇文章，题目是：“印度尼西亚人民为争取和平和民族阵线在即将举行的大选中的胜利而斗争”。
    文章说，今年九月底，印度尼西亚将选举二百五十名国会议员；在十二月中，将选举五百名制宪议会议员。这次选举对于印度尼西亚人民将有重大的历史意义，因为他们将有史以来第一次独立自主地决定，哪一种政府和什么样的宪法是符合他们的愿望的。
    文章说，目前，印度尼西亚各工厂、农村、学校和机关中正在举行集会，讨论有关大选的问题。各政府党也在全国各地举行集会。印度尼西亚共产党的候选人中不仅有党员，其中还有百分之三十是拥护共产党纲领的无党派人士。印度尼西亚共产党支持印度尼西亚国民党代表阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约所领导的目前政府的进步措施。印度尼西亚共产党支持举行大选的政策，以和平共处原则为基础的外交方针，支持给予共产党和群众性的民主组织的活动一定自由的政策，以及镇压由荷兰和美国帝国主义者建立起来并受到他们的资助的所谓“印度尼西亚回教共和国”和恐怖匪帮“回教国运动”的政策。
    文章指出，帝国主义国家，首先是荷兰和美国完全知道，如果在现在的印度尼西亚政府主持下面举行选举，那末它们在印度尼西亚的前途就完全黯淡了。正因为如此，荷兰和美国的帝国主义者正在集中一切力量来利用蒋介石分子和印度尼西亚人中的卖国贼以达到推翻现政府的目的。
    文章说，印度尼西亚共产党和其他民主党派和团体正在进行顽强的斗争，以挫败帝国主义者和卖国贼企图推翻现政府的罪恶阴谋。
    文章最后说，要使印度尼西亚有美好的未来，除了使印度尼西亚共产党所积极参加的民族统一阵线在即将举行的选举中取得胜利之外，没有其他的道路。民族阵线在即将举行的选举中的胜利将为印度尼西亚人民打开一个更加广阔的前途，鼓舞他们为消除印度尼西亚现在的半殖民地、半封建国家的状况，争取全国的彻底的民族独立而斗争。
