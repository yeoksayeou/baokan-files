How Local Industry Serves the Rural Economy
Hu Kaiming, Director of the Industry Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

In the past few years, local industries in Hebei Province have supplied farmers with a certain amount of means of production and means of livelihood, completed the processing of agricultural and sideline products, and supported agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. However, in implementing the principle of local industry serving the rural economy, some detours were taken. Before 1952, ignoring the actual needs of farmers, too many agricultural tools such as waterwheels, walking plows, and sprayers were manufactured, resulting in a large backlog. After correcting this deviation, another problem arose: many factories producing agricultural tools were converted to produce other products, so that the proportion of means of production supplied to rural areas by local industry gradually decreased. In 1952, the means of production provided for agriculture accounted for 6.58 percent of the province's total industrial output value; in 1953, it decreased to 6.48 percent; and in 1954, it decreased to 5.09 percent. Obviously, this situation is inconsistent with the central government's policy and the increasingly developing rural economy.

At present, the shortcomings existing in Hebei Province in implementing the principle of local industry serving the rural economy have begun to be overcome, but many problems still exist:

One, producing behind closed doors without investigating the needs of local farmers. Many enterprises stick to conventions, with few varieties and outdated styles. Although some enterprises actively manufacture new products, they lack investigation and research, and are not suitable for farmers' needs, so they cannot be promoted. Some enterprises simply pursue output value, regardless of the needs of the masses, and only focus on producing products with high value. Last year, some areas suffered from floods, and farmers urgently needed small iron pots to save fuel, but many factories, in order to pursue output value, still produced large pots in large quantities, which could not be sold as a result. Last year, the industrial department system alone had a backlog of more than 300,000 iron pots. Some factories only consider the convenience of production and disregard the needs of the local people's lives. For example, most of the socks produced are large sizes, and some women cannot buy suitable socks; most of the sweaters are pullover styles, which are not suitable for farmers' habits.

Two, many machinery and hardware factories generally only produce but do not repair or replace parts; or only produce finished products but not parts. Although some factories produce parts, the specifications are mostly inconsistent. If a farmer's agricultural tool breaks a part, it has to be transported to a distant place for repair, which is very inconvenient. Therefore, some farmers would rather put their broken farm tools aside than repair them, so many walking plows have become "hanging plows," and waterwheels have become "sleeping wheels." In some places, due to too few repair shops, farmers have to line up to repair their farm tools.

Three, the quality of products is low and the price is high. In February of this year, Henan Province signed a contract with Cangxian Iron Factory to purchase 300 grass cutters. One hundred of them broke down shortly after use, and the remaining 200 were returned. The enamel mugs produced by Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory are easily cracked and chipped, and the masses call this factory the "Chipping Factory." More seriously, some enterprises also engage in fraudulent and deceptive practices, using inferior goods as good goods to deceive farmers. For example, Cangxian Iron Factory once nailed the wooden frame of a slicer that had been broken, smeared it with oily mud, and sold it as a good product. Many products are too expensive, and farmers are unwilling to buy them. The high price is mostly due to the high cost, and partly due to the high profit margin.

In addition, the industrial sector lacks the necessary technical training, and farmers do not know how to use the new farm tools after buying them, which also makes it difficult to promote some new farm tools.

Due to these problems, local industries in Hebei Province cannot be closely integrated with the rural economy, cannot better support the socialist transformation of agriculture and meet the needs of the vast number of farmers, and in some aspects even affect the worker-peasant alliance. For example, last year, farmers in disaster areas near Shengfang Iron Factory in Tianjin Prefecture repeatedly asked them to produce tools needed for flood control, replanting, and sideline production, but they were always unwilling to produce them. This year, the factory sent people to the countryside to visit and hold forums, and talked a lot about the worker-peasant alliance. At first, many people came, but later, when they heard that it was Shengfang Iron Factory, the masses dispersed, leaving only a few old men to give the factory advice, saying: If you don't give what you need, this alliance is not easy to unite. This is an extremely profound lesson.

Because it is not well integrated with the rural economy, the imbalance between supply, production, and sales in local industry is becoming increasingly serious. According to incomplete statistics from local state-owned and joint state-private factories and mines in Hebei Province in 1954, the total value of products backlogged due to unsuitability for farmers' needs and low quality reached more than 10 million yuan. Some machinery and hardware industries are already on the verge of suspending work and closing factories. Some industrial leading organs and factory and mining enterprises do not pay attention to close integration with the rural economy, blindly pursue the speed of development, and blindly produce products for cities and export, resulting in either no sales or insufficient raw material supply, so they have to reduce production and stop production.

Most of the state-owned and cooperative enterprises in the local industry of Hebei Province are factories taken over from the enemy and puppets, and some of them were originally produced by our organs. These production units are mostly not organized in the direction of serving the rural economy in terms of production organization technology, equipment, and process procedures. In the past few years, although these enterprises have also carried out some reorganization and reforms, due to the lack of clear direction and experience, coupled with the stimulation of large-scale capital construction and the development of large-scale industry, there is great blindness in the transformation. Some leading personnel of industrial enterprises do not understand the correct relationship between industry and agriculture, nor do they see the new changes that have taken place in agricultural production and farmers' lives since liberation, especially after the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. They believe that since the development speed of industry in the period of economic construction must exceed that of agriculture, they blindly believe that the way out for local industry to process for capital construction and large-scale industry is great, and the way out for facing the rural areas is small. Closely linked to these ideas, many leading cadres of enterprises have purely pursued the capitalist management ideology of output value and profit, only wanting to do large batches of whole work, not wanting to do small batches of piecemeal work; only wanting to do work with high output value and high profit, not wanting to do work with low output value and low profit; only wanting to do ready-made work and produce old products, not wanting to create new products, disliking trouble, and fearing difficulties, and so on. These are the main reasons for the long-term neglect of serving the rural economy.

Therefore, in order to implement the principle of local industry serving the rural economy and closely integrating with the rural economy, we must first make leaders at all levels realize that although the tasks of local industry are multifaceted, its most important task is to meet the needs of the local people, especially to support the development of agricultural production; at the same time, the raw material supply and product sales of local industry must be basically solved locally on the basis of national planning balance, and the production and construction plans of local industry must be determined according to local needs and possibilities. Only in this way can the development of local industry be established on a reliable basis. In fact, many local industrial enterprises have fundamentally changed the situation of "not being able to eat enough" due to the correct production policy. For example, the three iron factories in Cangxian Prefecture visited the countryside in February this year and signed contracts and agreements with eleven counties, undertaking to manufacture nearly 10,000 pieces of grass cutters, iron shovels, iron pots, and other agricultural tools. Gaocheng Iron Factory in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, with only seventeen or eight workers, both produces and repairs, which meets the requirements of farmers. Last year, it had a lot of production tasks and earned 12,000 yuan. These facts powerfully illustrate that local industry has broad prospects in facing the countryside.

Secondly, we must do a good job in investigating and studying the rural market, determine the production objects and the specifications, quality, and quantity of products according to the needs of farmers, and overcome the phenomenon of producing behind closed doors. However, the work of investigating rural needs and manufacturing new products must be carried out in an organized and led manner, and close contact must be made with relevant departments such as supply and marketing and agriculture to prevent the occurrence of one-sidedness and repeated investigation. After mastering the rural needs, it is also necessary to classify products, seek regional balance on the basis of national balance, and uniformly allocate tasks to enterprises of various economic types according to the policy of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, so as to avoid the phenomenon of each factory blindly producing the same product or not producing a certain product, resulting in an imbalance between supply, production, and sales.

Third, we must, in the spirit of making full use of existing equipment, reorganize or reform some unreasonable existing enterprises in a planned and appropriate manner according to local needs, so as to meet the requirements of serving the rural economy.

Fourth, we must organize a farm tool repair and replacement network in a planned way to solve the difficulties for farmers in repairing and replacing farm tools. The organization of the repair and replacement network should have unified planning, and appropriate division of labor should be carried out in terms of products and regions according to the organizational and technical characteristics of various economic types. In this regard, we should give full play to the role of handicraft cooperatives and individual handicrafts, and local state-owned industry should provide guidance and assistance in technology.

Fifth, we must earnestly strengthen enterprise management, strengthen technical work, improve quality, increase variety, reduce costs, and supply farmers with high-quality and inexpensive products. At the same time, the industrial sector should also actively assist the agricultural technology departments in doing a good job in technical training, so that farmers can master the performance of new farm tools.

　　地方工业怎样为农村经济服务
　　中共河北省委工业部部长　胡开明
    河北省的地方工业，几年来，给农民供应了一定数量的生产资料和生活资料，完成了农副产品的加工任务，支持了农业生产和互助合作运动。但是在执行地方工业为农村经济服务的方针上，走了一些弯路。在一九五二年以前，曾不顾农民实际需要，过多地制造了水车、步犁、喷雾器等农具，造成了大量的积压。这一偏向纠正后，又产生了把许多生产农具的工厂改产了别种产品，以致地方工业供应农村生产资料的比重逐年缩小。一九五二年为农业提供的生产资料占全省工业生产总值的百分之六点五八，一九五三年降为百分之六点四八，一九五四年又降为百分之五点零九。显然，这种情况和中央的方针是不相符合的，和日益发展的农村经济也是不相适应的。
    现在，河北省在贯彻地方工业为农村经济服务的方针中所存在的缺点已开始克服，但还存在许多问题：
    一、不调查研究当地农民的需要，关门生产。许多企业墨守成规，品种很少，样式陈旧。有些企业虽然积极制造新产品，但缺乏调查研究，不适合农民需要，推销不了。有些企业单纯追求产值，不管群众需要，只顾生产价值大的产品。去年有些地区遭受了水灾，农民迫切需要小铁锅以节省燃料，但许多工厂为了追求产值，仍大量铸造大锅，结果销不出去；去年全省仅工业厅系统即积压了铁锅三十多万口。还有些工厂，只顾生产方便，不顾当地群众生活的需要。如生产的袜子大多是大号的，有些妇女买不到适用的袜子；绒衣多是套头的，不适合农民的习惯。
    二、许多机械铁器工厂普遍是只生产，不修配；或者只生产成品，不生产零件。有些工厂虽然生产零件，但规格也多不一致。农民买来的农具只要坏了一个零件，就得运到很远的地方去修配，很不方便。因而有些农民的农具坏了，宁可搁置起来，也不愿去修理，许多步犁就这样变成了“挂犁”，水车变成了“睡车”。有些地方由于修配厂过少，农民不得不排队去修配农具。
    三、产品质量低，价格高。今年二月份河南省向沧县铁工厂订了购买三百台铡草机的合同，一百台使用不久就坏了，其余二百台都退了回来。石家庄搪瓷厂的口杯，很容易裂纹和掉瓷，群众把这个厂称做“掉瓷厂”。更严重的是有些企业还有伪装造假的行为，以次货冒充好货，欺骗农民。如沧县铁工厂曾把木架已断的切片机用钉钉住，抹上油泥，冒充好货卖出。有许多产品价格过高，农民不愿买。价格高的原因，大部分是由于成本太高，一部分是由于利润偏高。
    此外，工业部门缺少必要的技术传授工作，农民买了去不会用，也使一些新式农具不易推广。
    由于存在这些问题，河北省地方工业不能跟农村经济密切结合，不能更好地支持农业的社会主义改造和满足广大农民的需要，在某些方面甚至影响了工农联盟。例如去年天津专区胜芳铁工厂附近的灾区农民，几次要求他们生产防洪、抢种和副业生产所需的工具，但他们始终不肯生产。今年这个厂派人下乡访问，召开座谈会，大讲工农联盟，开始来人很多，后来一听说是胜芳铁工厂，群众纷纷散去，只剩下几个老头给这个厂提意见说：要什么不给什么，咱们这个盟不好联。这是一个极为深刻的教训。
    由于没有很好地跟农村经济密切结合，地方工业供、产、销不平衡的情况日益严重。据河北省地方国营、公私合营厂矿一九五四年的不完整统计，由于不适合农民需要和质量过低而积压的产品，总值达一千多万元。有的机械铁器业已频于停工关厂的危险境地。还有些工业领导机关和厂矿企业，不注意同农村经济密切结合，盲目追求发展速度，盲目生产以城市和外销为对象的产品，结果不是没有销路就是原料供应不足，只好减产停产。
    河北省地方工业中的国营和合作社营企业，多半是从敌伪手里接收过来的工厂，还有的原是我们的机关生产，这些生产单位，在生产组织技术、设备、工艺程序等方面，多不是按着为农村经济服务的方向组织的。几年来，这些企业虽也进行了一些改组和改革，但因方针不明确，经验缺乏，加之受大规模的基本建设和大工业的发展的刺激，在改造中有很大的盲目性。有些工业企业领导人员不了解工农业的正确关系，也没有看到解放以来，特别是农业互助合作运动开展以后，在农业生产和农民生活上所发生的新变化，认为在经济建设时期工业的发展速度既要超过农业，就盲目地认为地方工业为基本建设和大工业加工的出路大，面向农村的出路小。跟这些思想紧密联系的，还有许多企业的领导干部存在单纯追求产值和利润的资本主义经营思想，只想作大批的整活，不愿作小批的零活；只想作产值大利润高的活，不愿作产值小利润低的活；只想作现成活，出旧产品，不想创制新产品，嫌麻烦、怕困难等等。这些就是长期地忽视为农村经济服务的主要原因。
    因此，要贯彻地方工业为农村经济服务并跟农村经济密切结合的方针，首先就必须使各级领导人员认识：地方工业的任务虽是多方面的，但其最主要的任务则是满足当地人民的需要，尤其是扶植农业生产的发展；同时，地方工业的原料供应和产品销售，在全国计划平衡的基础上，基本上都要从当地求得解决，根据当地的需要和可能来确定地方工业的生产和建设计划。只有这样，地方工业的发展才能建立在可靠的基础上。事实上，已有不少地方工业企业由于生产方针正确，已根本改变了“吃不饱”的状况。如沧县专区的三个铁工厂，今年二月深入农村访问，同十一个县订立了合同和协议，承制了铡草机、铁锨、铁锅和其他农具近万件。石家庄专区的藁城铁工厂，只有十七、八个工人，既生产又修配，适合农民的要求，去年生产任务很多，获利一万二千元。这些事实有力地说明了地方工业面向农村是有广阔前途的。
    其次，要做好农村市场的调查研究工作，按照农民需要确定生产对象和产品的规格、质量和数量，克服关门生产的现象。但调查农村需要和制造新产品的工作，必须有组织有领导地进行，要跟供销、农业等有关部门取得密切联系，以防片面性和重复调查现象的发生。在掌握了农村需要之后，还要按产品分类，在全国平衡的基础上谋求地区平衡，并根据统筹兼顾，全面安排的方针，对各种经济类型的企业统一分配任务，避免各厂盲目生产同一产品或都不生产某一产品，造成供产销不平衡的现象。
    第三、要本着尽量利用现有设备的精神，根据当地需要，有计划地、适当地改组或改革一些不合理的现有企业，使之符合于为农村经济服务的要求。
    第四、要有计划地组织农具修配网，解决农民修配农具的困难。组织修配网要有统一的筹划，按照各经济类型的组织和技术特点，从产品和地区上适当分工。在这方面，应充分发挥手工业合作社和个体手工业的作用，地方国营工业则在技术上给以指导和协助。
    第五、要切实加强企业管理，加强技术工作，改善质量，增加品种，降低成本，供应农民以物美价廉的产品。同时，工业部门还应主动地协助农业技术部门做好技术传授工作，以便农民掌握新式农具的性能。
