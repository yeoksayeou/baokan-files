Hu Feng's subjective idealism in his literary and artistic thought belongs to which school of subjective idealistic philosophy? Without solving this problem, we cannot understand the thorough reactionariness of Hu Feng's thought, and we cannot understand why he hates the Marxist-Leninist worldview so much.

Just by looking at Hu Feng's articles, we can see that he has ideological connections with bourgeois idealistic literary theorists like the Japanese Hakuson Kuriyagawa. Hu Feng's articles are filled with fervent cries of "subjective fighting spirit," "strength of personality," "artistic conscience," "sincerity," "fighting will," and "fighting demands," and are full of phrases like "primitive powerful force," "active liberation of personality," "self-expansion of vitality," "flesh and blood pursuit," "desperate struggle of mutual generation and mutual restraint," "desperate gamble of vitality," and "fiercely fighting the past, tragically advancing towards the future." It can be said that none of these things are Hu Feng's "creation," but rather copied from Hakuson Kuriyagawa.

Everywhere in Hu Feng's works, we can encounter the names of Gorky and Lu Xun, but we cannot smell the breath of Gorky and Lu Xun, but we can smell the stench of Hakuson Kuriyagawa. Therefore, studying the literary and artistic thought of writers like Hakuson Kuriyagawa is beneficial to understanding Hu Feng.

Hakuson Kuriyagawa takes the "self-vitality" of the writer as the basis of his literary theory. He said: "Our life is originally the universal life between heaven and earth. But if this life force is contained in or through a person, and manifests itself through this 'person,' it becomes individuality and becomes active. When the life force burning inside becomes individuality and is brought into play, it is when people are urged by inner demands to express their individuality, and there is a real creative life. So it can also be said that the expression of one's own life is the expression of individuality, and the expression of individuality is the creative life." ("Symbol of Anguish," in "Complete Works of Lu Xun," Volume 13, p. 24) Kuriyagawa believes that this "inner demand" of the writer is the inner life lying deep in the writer's heart. This inner life accumulates many extremely painful and profound injuries. When it moves towards the road of life, it experiences anguish on the one hand and participates in tragic battles on the other, sometimes groaning and weeping, sometimes rejoicing and praising. And these sounds of groaning, weeping, rejoicing, and praising are literature and art. It is said that this kind of literature and art is the march of life, the trumpet of advance. This loud and far-reaching sound has the great power to penetrate heaven and earth and move hundreds of generations! Kuriyagawa believes that literary creation is "a subjective expression of things accumulated in the writer's heart outward." "Literature and art are purely the expression of life; they are the only world that can completely leave external oppression and coercion and stand on an absolutely free state of mind to express individuality." "The genius in literature and art is a 'spiritual adventurer' who leaps and rushes forward." Therefore, Kuriyagawa boldly defines art: "...taking absolute freedom as the only life of pure creation is art." (Emphasis added by the author)

This is the basis of Kuriyagawa's literary theory. This basis is the writer's vitality, the writer's inner life, the writer's sighs and sounds of joy, and the writer's adventurous spirit of leaping forward. Its form of expression is the writer's absolute freedom of creation.

For this reason, Kuriyagawa said: "Focusing on the vitality that is always seeking freedom and liberation without ceasing, the desire for individual expression... this tendency is the general trend of the recent ideological world... it is a reaction against the materialism and determinism since the last century." (Ibid., p. 43) Kuriyagawa affirmed this "reaction" as the theoretical basis of his literary thought.

Obviously, everything that Kuriyagawa has is everything that Hu Feng has. In Hu Feng's articles, the constant appearance of things like "subjective demands" and "artistic conscience" are what Kuriyagawa calls the writer's "inner life." What Hu Feng calls his "heart to conquer darkness," "heart to seize light," and "flesh and blood pursuit" are what Kuriyagawa calls "the expression of the writer's vitality." What Hu Feng calls "flesh and blood advance into the actual content," "flesh and blood struggle," and "the struggle of mutual generation and mutual restraint executed by subjective ideological demands" are what Kuriyagawa calls the leaping and advancing adventurous spirit of literary genius. And what Hu Feng calls "freedom is the thorough liberation of the subjective spirit" is exactly what Kuriyagawa calls "taking absolute freedom as pure creation."

The reason why Kuriyagawa's literary theory is reactionary is that he denies that literature and art are objective descriptions of reality, that literature and art are artistic reflections of the objective social reality; he denies that art and science are the same, and that the basic role in them is the observation, comparison, and study of real life, and that in essence, artistic and scientific knowledge are reflections of the objective world (the difference is that scientific thinking is a form of reasoning and judgment thinking, while artistic thinking is a form of image thinking). That is to say, he denies the materialist principle that literature and art are reflections of objective reality, and attributes it to the expression of the writer's subjective vitality. This is a completely idealistic principle, and Hu Feng is following this point. Isn't this Hu Feng taking the bourgeois literary thought of Kuriyagawa and others as the theoretical basis of his literary thought? Isn't this Hu Feng thoroughly accepting the bourgeois anti-materialist worldview?

Regarding the deep and far-reaching ideological connection between Hu Feng and Kuriyagawa, Hu Feng himself also provided strong evidence. This is what he said in "Memories of the Idealist Era": "In the more than two years of life in N City, Mr. W in the university and student Y, who was one grade below me, pushed me to know more and touched society more closely. But at the same time, I became more sensitive and more obsessed with the atmosphere of literature. At this time, I read two books that submerged me headlessly: Tolstoy's Resurrection and Kuriyagawa Hakuson's Symbol of Anguish. Love and art seemed to be two sides of something supreme in life, and gradually conflicted with my social behavior." ("Literary Notes," p. 344) Obviously, Hu Feng had already formed an indissoluble bond with Kuriyagawa's "Symbol of Anguish" in his youth.

Obviously, this is the real reason why we encounter the names of Gorky and Lu Xun more often in Hu Feng's works but cannot smell the breath of Gorky and Lu Xun; we encounter the name of Kuriyagawa Hakuson less often but can completely smell the stench of Kuriyagawa Hakuson.

Hakuson Kuriyagawa, who was in the country of Japanese imperialism, witnessed the approaching collapse and death of capitalism. In his literary and artistic thought, from his class nature, he reflected this pessimistic and decadent mood, believing that "the root of literature and art is the anguish and annoyance caused by the suppression of vitality," and demanded the "breakthrough, leap," and "adventure" of life, which is very natural. And it should be particularly pointed out that in China in 1924, Mr. Lu Xun, who had not yet mastered the proletarian worldview, hoped that a great spirit like a heavenly horse soaring through the sky would produce great art to save China's "withered stagnation," mistakenly believing that Kuriyagawa's thought would help the development of progressive Chinese literary thought. This did not affect the greatness of Mr. Lu Xun, because Mr. Lu Xun later realized a revolution from the theory of evolution to the Marxist-Leninist worldview. Kuriyagawa's literary thought had long been abandoned by him. But Hu Feng has been holding it as a treasure for many years and secretly selling it, which cannot but be Hu Feng's sin.

After we have exposed this point, we need to go one step further. It is precisely from the connection between Hu Feng and Kuriyagawa's literary thought that we have glimpsed the worldview foundation of Hu Feng's literary thought. The following passage from Kuriyagawa is an important clue for us to solve this problem.

Kuriyagawa Hakuson wrote: "To regard the lightning-like, rushing, sudden, and almost recklessly advancing force of life as the fundamental thing in human life is the consensus of many modern thinkers. Not to mention Bergson's philosophy, which believes that change and flow are reality and says 'creative evolution,' in Schopenhauer's theory of will, in Nietzsche's theory of instinct and superman, in Bernard Shaw's drama Man and Superman's 'life force,' in Carpenter's 'cosmic self' theory, which acknowledges the eternal and indestructible creativity of human life, and in recent times, in Russell's impulse theory, which is the fundamental meaning of social transformation, can we not all glimpse the meaning of 'the force of life'?" ("Symbol of Anguish," p. 22)

Kuriyagawa Hakuson clearly stated the direct source of his literary and artistic thought with the idealistic Bergson, the voluntarist Schopenhauer, the Nietzsche of the philosophy of the Superman, and others. This is an important issue. Because this is the worldview foundation of Kuriyagawa's literary thought, and it is also the worldview foundation of Hu Feng's literary thought. From this foundation, Kuriyagawa's literary thought is a mixture of reactionary philosophical schools of the bourgeoisie since the last century, and Hu Feng is exactly the same.

This is the bottom card of Hu Feng's reactionary literary and artistic thought. Once it is revealed, it will be clear at a glance what materials Hu Feng's "self-expansion," "subjective fighting spirit," and so on are made of.

Now we should analyze the basic ideas of these reactionary philosophical schools, especially the basic ideas of Bergson's philosophy.

Bergson was a French philosopher, and the most important representative of intuitionism, one of the most reactionary idealistic philosophical schools of the near century. Bergson's idealism is prominently manifested in his "mediation" of the contradiction between matter and consciousness with life, and his sophistical substitution and melting of matter with life, a reactionary point of view. Bergson explained his views in detail in his article "Life and Consciousness." He believes that consciousness and matter are two fundamentally different existences, or two mutually opposed existences, because matter is necessary and consciousness is free (please note, dear readers, that Bergson's "necessity" and "freedom" are completely different from our "necessity" and "freedom"); but life has a way to mediate their mutual opposition. This is that life can insert the freedom of consciousness into the necessity of matter; using the necessity of matter to seek the freedom of consciousness. Bergson believes that if matter does not allow "relaxation" at all, there can be no life. But when matter "slightly retreats" at some time and some place, "slightly showing elasticity," then that time and that place is the best opportunity for consciousness, this "freedom," to invade matter, this "necessity." But in this "initial" invasion, consciousness must show a little "humility" and not immediately "rush forward," but "once invaded," "it will gradually expand, gradually expand from the point of invasion, and will not stop until it defeats the entire body." When consciousness overcomes the entire body of matter, it obtains complete "freedom." This is the vast神通 (supernatural power) of life ("Life and Will," in "Philosophical Magazine," Issue 8, p. 10).

Obviously, this is Bergson attacking Marxist-Leninist materialism. He wants to use the concept of life to cancel the concept of matter. From the Marxist-Leninist point of view, life is the product of the long-term development of the objective material world. Science proves that the phenomenon of life appeared in the universe after tens of thousands of years. But from Bergson's point of view, there is a super-material life that inserts itself into necessary matter and obtains the freedom of consciousness. Here Bergson uses life to cancel matter, melt matter, and the reason why life can do this is because of the gradual expansion of life until it finally defeats the entire body of matter. This is Bergson's "theory" of self-expansion of life derived from opposing Marxism-Leninism.

Regarding this self-expansion of life, Bergson also pointed out its own driving force. He believes that the evolution of life, from its "source" to mankind, "is like a great river of consciousness, rushing towards the material flow, intending only to open a tunnel, experimenting left or right, rushing in more or less," and mostly hitting rocks, hurting itself. But at least it can open its way in one direction to reach the light, "evolving to mankind." Bergson believes that when life rushes to the "light" of mankind, it "melts into individuality and ultimately becomes personality," and this personality is called "creative personality," a personality that "creates itself." And this personality continues to exist even after a person dies. Bergson calls it "preservation of personality" and "expansion of personality." This is the "theory" of "personality theory" and "creative transformation theory" derived from Bergson's opposition to Marxist-Leninist materialism, achieved by the self-expansion of life.

Bergson's "personality theory" and "creative transformation theory" extremely exaggeratedly describe the magic of the self-expansion of life. But why can life expand itself so limitlessly? Bergson believes that this is the "instinct" of life, and for humans, it is because "instinct" and "wisdom" were "mixed together" at the beginning, "mutually contained." Once there is human life, there is everything. Bergson said: "We only follow the operation of nature, without the need for special cultivation," "Sometimes we feel that the knowledge we seek is infinitely far away, but who knows that it is right beside us, but waiting for the opportunity for us to discover it ourselves." (Ibid., p. 20)

For this reason, Bergson firmly opposes the important role of human scientific knowledge and revolutionary theory. Bergson advocates that people can instinctively and intuitively recognize everything, and that everything is by their side. This is the "theory" of "instinct theory" and "intuition theory" derived from Bergson's opposition to Marxist-Leninist materialism.

From the Marxist-Leninist point of view, matter is primary and consciousness is secondary, the primary determines the secondary, and the secondary can give the primary a dynamic reaction. But Bergson denies this, he believes that consciousness is primary and matter is secondary, consciousness determines matter.

On the basis of this reactionary theory, Bergson's reactionary view of history is constructed. Bergson's "wonderful" theory is: life, at the beginning, "foresightedly" knew the necessity of social life, and knew that its original and important desires could only be satisfied in society. Therefore, life "causes individual will to join social will." (Ibid., p. 8) According to Bergson, society is a collection of individual abilities, and everything in society is the free creation of people's free will. This is the "theory" of "free will theory" that Bergson reached by opposing Marxist-Leninist scientific view of history.

From the Marxist-Leninist point of view, history is the history of the development of production, the history of class struggle, and the development of history has its own regularity. For people to truly achieve freedom, that is, what we usually call moving from necessity to freedom, they must practice through the practice of production struggle and class struggle, recognize these laws, and use these laws. For this reason, scientific theories that summarize the experience of production and class struggle and reflect the laws of historical development and social development are of particular importance. But Bergson believes that the development of history is only the self-expansion of the nature of life, only the free creation of people's will.

In this way, Bergson's philosophical thought has become one of the most reactionary philosophical schools of the near century, and has become the tool that is most conducive to the reactionary ruling class, violently opposes the working class and the working people, and opposes the scientific revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism.

This is a simple summary of several basic points of Bergson's philosophical thought.

From these basic points, it can be completely seen what is the main basis of the worldview of Kuriyagawa's literary and artistic thought, and thus it can also be seen what is the main basis of the worldview of Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought. The worldview of Kuriyagawa and Hu Feng contains a mixture of several idealistic philosophical schools, but the main things they express in their literary and artistic thought make it very clear to see the connection between them and Bergson's philosophical thought.

Although Hu Feng has never explicitly declared that he is a follower of Bergson's philosophical thought, and Hu Feng can even explicitly declare that he has never studied Bergson's philosophy, or even is an opponent of Bergson's philosophy, Bergson's philosophical thought is like a gray thread that runs through a series of important viewpoints of Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought.

We will briefly analyze it below.

First of all, it is about the issue of life or vitality. As mentioned earlier, Bergson cancels the concept of matter with the concept of life, and replaces the objective material world with subjective life, which constitutes the philosophical basis of Bergson's subjective idealism. And on this point, Hu Feng and Bergson completely reached the same conclusion. In the literary and artistic thought of the Hu Feng clique, the writer's "vitality" is defined as the primary source of creation. That is to say, it belongs to the primary thing, and the objective material world belongs to the secondary thing (of course, the writer cannot engage in creation without life, but the problem is that if the writer regards his life as the primary thing in artistic creation, then it cannot but be a strange talk). In the articles of the Hu Feng clique, subjective and life are synonymous terms. According to their statement, "subjective" things are the deterioration of natural vitality; and objective things can only win their life through the subjective. The former statement is what Shu Wu said, "Humans organically combine with social factors with their original natural vitality... and deteriorate into 'subjective'" ("On Subjective," "Hope" Issue 1, p. 69); the latter statement is what Hu Feng said, "Life events... obtain deeper and broader content and more ideological vitality through his subjective pursuit or subjective improvement" ("Days of Adversity," p. 3). Therefore, this subjective life or the subjective of life is the only basis for the philosophical and literary thought of the Hu Feng clique. This is the first conclusion we should draw.

The second is about the issue of "self-expansion," "personality strength," and "subjective fighting spirit." Once we have clarified that the basis of Hu Feng's philosophical and literary thought is Bergson's theory of vitality, then this series of problems will be easily solved. Since vitality is the foundation that determines everything, then the "self-expansion" of the writer that Hu Feng said cannot but be the self-expansion of the writer's vitality, and the "personality strength" of the writer that Hu Feng said cannot but be the self-creation and sublimation of the writer's vitality. On the basis of this expansion, creation, and sublimation, the writer's "subjective fighting spirit" of "fiercely fighting the past and tragically advancing towards the future" cannot but be produced. Obviously, all this is completely the rumination of Bergson's philosophical thought. And here Hu Feng's "theory" of realism powerfully proves this point. Hu Feng wrote in "Days of Adversity": "The struggle of mutual generation and mutual restraint between the creative subject (the writer himself) and the creative object (material) in the creative process; the subject overcomes (deepens, improves) the object, and the object also overcomes (expands, corrects) the subject. This is the most basic spirit of realism." ("Days of Adversity," p. 105) Obviously, this creative subject, according to Hu Feng's own annotation, is the writer himself, and the writer himself is the writer's own vitality. Therefore, this kind of "struggle of mutual generation and mutual restraint between the subject and the creative object" is essentially nothing more than the struggle in which the writer's subjective vitality breaks into the objective object and melts and absorbs the objective object, and thereby strengthens the writer's "self-expansion" and promotes the writer's "subjective fighting spirit." In short, replacing the object with the subject and replacing the objective with the subjective is the essence of the "realism" of the Hu Feng clique, which is also the foundation and source of the powerful vitality of the "self-expansion," "personality strength," and "subjective fighting spirit" of the Hu Feng clique. This is the second conclusion we should draw.

Now let us summarize these two conclusions together, and we can clearly see that Hu Feng's philosophical thought is a thorough subjective idealism, and its basic characteristics are also the same as other subjective idealistic philosophical schools, ultimately reaching the conclusion of solipsism. And it is precisely on the worldview basis of this solipsistic philosophy that the reactionary literary and artistic thought and literary and artistic line of the Hu Feng clique, which have been in sharp opposition to our party's literary and artistic thought and literary and artistic line for many years, are constructed. This is the third conclusion we should draw.

It can be seen from this that it is by no means accidental that the works of the Hu Feng clique are full of an atmosphere of despising and slandering the people, even being anti-people. They regard the people as insects and flies, and regard the revolutionary struggle of the people as a living image of crawling. From the perspective of solipsists - "supermen" writers, that is very appropriate. Nietzsche, who is closely connected with Bergson's philosophy, clearly said: "Mankind is less of an end than it is a means... Mankind is nothing more than material for experimentation, a pile of superfluous waste products, a pile of broken tiles."

It can be seen from this that it is by no means accidental that the works of the Hu Feng clique are full of enthusiastic cheers for the images of bourgeois individualism - such as Jiang Chunzu (Lu Ling: "The Children of the Rich"), who was called by Hu Feng the true image of life leaping. Because characters like Jiang Chunzu are typical personalities of typical characters shaped according to the bourgeois ideology of the Hu Feng clique, and the "tendency that can connect the whole horizontally and connect the past to the future vertically" that he possesses is precisely the "self-expansion" and "subjective fighting spirit" of the Hu Feng clique. On the contrary, the crazy "workers," crazy "peasants," and crazy "soldiers" in the Hu Feng clique's writings are also completely understandable, because in the eyes of solipsists - "supermen" writers, workers, peasants, and soldiers are the dark mass of perceptual objects that they should use the writer's vitality to dissolve and absorb. These common people should "not know and not know, obey the laws of the emperor" and listen to their "subjective fighting spirit" to arbitrarily manipulate them, because Schopenhauer, who is closely connected with Bergson's philosophical thought, also clearly said: "This world is my idea"!

It can be seen from this that it is by no means accidental that Hu Feng firmly opposes Marxist-Leninist historical materialism and opposes the theory of production development and class struggle. Because from the perspective of solipsists - "supermen" writers, they themselves have "outstanding" personalities and absolute will, and they are the creators of history and society. For this reason, Hu Feng called Shu Wu's article "On Subjective" "a problem that will affect the struggle for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation." Because Shu Wu's article nakedly opposed the theory of Marxist-Leninist historical materialism, and highly promoted the spirit and essence of Hu Feng's "subjective" or "vitality" "theory" - the development of this "subjective" or "vitality" finally "truly realized the nature of the great universe - the heavenly heart that is constantly growing." This is "completely in line with my wishes" for Hu Feng, because Hu Feng himself clearly said: "Writers, through their spiritual abilities... create a unique spiritual world," "He wants to travel through the world of laws to the spiritual world," so that the "great universe" can "crystallize" in the "small universe." ("Life, Literature and Art, Literary Criticism")

It can be seen from this that it is by no means accidental that the Hu Feng clique firmly opposes the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the scientific worldview that constitutes its theoretical basis. Because in the eyes of solipsists - "supermen" writers, only the philosophical thoughts of Bergson, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, and only the literary and artistic thought of Kuriyagawa Hakuson are "hot," and the theory of Marxism-Leninism and its worldview cannot but be "cold" or "knives" and "sticks" for them!

Therefore, our conclusion is: The protracted struggle that Hu Feng and our party have carried out in the literary and artistic front for more than ten years is a struggle between the subjective idealistic worldview and the dialectical materialistic worldview. And today, when our country is carrying out a great socialist revolution and construction, Hu Feng violently and suddenly proposed his anti-socialist program, which is precisely the bourgeois ideology under the guidance of his reactionary idealistic worldview attacking the working class and its vanguard - the Communist Party of China, and also the people of the whole country!

    胡风文艺思想的反动世界观基础
    孙定国
    胡风在他的文艺思想里所表现的主观唯心主义是属于哪一种主观唯心主义哲学流派呢？不解决这个问题，就无法了解胡风思想的彻底反动性，就无法了解他为什么那样仇视马克思列宁主义的世界观。
    只要看一下胡风的文章，就可以看出他和日本厨川白村一类的资产阶级唯心主义文艺理论家有思想上的渊源关系。在胡风的文章里充满了“主观战斗精神”、“人格力量”、“艺术良心”、“真诚”、“战斗意志”、“战斗要求”等热狂的叫喊，充满了“原始的强力”、“个性的积极解放”、“生命力的自我扩张”、“血肉追求”、“相生相克的决死斗争”、“生命力的孤注一掷”、“凶猛地向过去搏斗，悲壮地向未来突进”一类的词句。这些东西，可以说没有一点是胡风的“创造”，而是从厨川白村那里抄袭来的。
    在胡风的作品里到处可以遇见高尔基和鲁迅的名字，但是嗅不出一点高尔基和鲁迅的气息，而能够嗅到的却是厨川白村的臭味。因此研究一下厨川白村这类作家的文艺思想对于了解胡风是有益的。
    厨川白村是以作家的“自我生命力”作为他的文艺理论的基础的。他说：“我们的生命，本是在天地万象间的普遍的生命。但如这生命的力含在或一个人中，经了其‘人’而显现的时候，这就成为个性而活跃了。在里面烧着的生命的力成为个性而发挥出来的时候，就是人们为内底要求所催促，想要表现自己的个性的时候，其间就有着真的创造创作的生活。所以也就可以说，自己生命的表现，也就是个性的表现，个性的表现，便是创造的生活了罢。”（“苦闷的象征”，载“鲁迅全集”第十三册，第二四页）厨川白村认为这个作家“内底要求”就是伏在作家的心的深处的内心生活。这个内心生活，是蓄积着许多极痛烈而且极深刻的伤害的。当它向着人生的道路前进的时候，一方面经历着苦闷，一方面参与着悲惨的战斗，有时呻吟号泣，有时又欢乐赞美。而这种呻吟号泣、欢乐赞美的声音，就是文艺。据说这种文艺就是生命的进行曲，就是进军的喇叭。它这种响亮洪远的声音具有着贯天地、动百世的伟力！厨川白村认为：文艺创作乃是“蓄在作家的内心的东西的主观的向外面表现出去”。“文艺是纯然的生命的表现；是能够全然离了外界的压抑和强制，站在绝对自由的心境上，表现出个性来的唯一世界。”“文艺上的天才，是飞跃突进的‘精神底冒险者。’”因此厨川白村大胆地给艺术下了定义：“……以绝对的自由，作纯粹创造的唯一的生活就是艺术。”（以上着重点是我加的——作者）
    这就是厨川白村的文艺理论的基础。这个基础就是作家的生命力，作家的内心生活，作家所发出来的悲叹和欢乐的声音，作家的飞跃突进的冒险精神。它的表现形式就是作家的绝对自由的创作。
    为此，厨川白村说：“着重于永是求自由解放而不息的生命力，个性表现的欲望，……这倾向，是最近思想界的大势……是对于前世纪以来的唯物观决定论的反动。”（同上，第四十三页）厨川白村把这个“反动”肯定为他的文艺思想的理论基础。
    显然，厨川白村的这一切就是胡风的一切。在胡风的文章里，不断地出现的什么“主观要求”、“艺术良心”等，也就是厨川白村所说的作家的“内心生活”。胡风所说的自己的“征服黑暗的心”“夺取光明的心”“血肉追求”等，也就是厨川白村所说的“作家生命力的表现”。胡风所说的“血肉地突进实际的内容”“血肉的搏斗”“主观的思想要求所执行的相生相克的搏斗”等，也就是厨川白村所说的文艺的天才的飞跃突进的冒险精神。而胡风所说的“自由是主观精神的彻底解放”，也正就是厨川白村所说的“以绝对的自由，作纯粹创造”。
    厨川白村的文艺理论之所以反动，就在他否认了文艺是现实的客观的描写，文艺是社会的客观的现实生活在艺术上的反映；他否认了艺术和科学是一样，在其中起基本作用的是对现实生活的观察、比较和研究，在本质上艺术和科学的认识都是对于客观世界的反映（所不同的是科学的思维是推理判断的思维形式，而艺术的思维则是形象的思维形式）。这也就是说，他否认了文艺是客观现实生活的反映的唯物主义的原则，而把它归结为作家的主观生命力的表现。这是彻底唯心主义的原则，胡风就是宗奉这一点。这难道不是胡风把厨川白村一类资产阶级的文艺思想作为他的文艺思想的理论基础吗？这难道不是胡风彻头彻尾地接受了资产阶级反唯物主义的世界观吗？
    关于胡风和厨川白村的思想上的深远的渊源关系，胡风自己也提出了有力的证据。这就是他在
  “理想主义者时代底回忆”中一段话：“在N城的两年多的生活里面，大学里的W君和比我低一级的同学Y君推着我更多地知道了，更关切地触到了社会。但同时对于文学的气息也更加敏感更加迷恋了。这时候我读了两本没头没脑地把我淹没了的书：托尔斯太底复活和厨川白村底苦闷的象征。恋爱和艺术，似乎是表现人生里面的什么至上的东西底两面，和我的社会行为渐渐地矛盾起来了。”（“文艺笔谈”，第三四四页）显然，胡风在他的青年时代已经和厨川白村的“苦闷的象征”结成了不解之缘了。
    显然，这就是为什么在胡风的作品里我们较多地遇见高尔基和鲁迅的名字而却嗅不出高尔基和鲁迅的气息；较少地遇见厨川白村的名字反而完全嗅得出厨川白村的臭味的真正原因。
    处在日本帝国主义的国家的厨川白村，目睹资本主义的接近崩溃和死亡，在他的文艺思想里，从他的阶级本性上反映出这种悲观没落的情调，认为“生命力受了压制而生苦闷懊恼乃是文艺的根柢”，要求生命的“突进跳跃”和“冒险”，这是很自然的。而且应该特别指出，处在一九二四年的中国，还没有掌握无产阶级世界观的鲁迅先生，希望有天马行空的大精神产生大艺术，来挽救中国的“萎靡锢蔽”，误认为厨川白村的思想有助于中国进步文艺思想的发展。这并没有影响鲁迅先生的伟大，因为鲁迅先生在后来曾经实现了从进化论到马克思列宁主义世界观的革命。厨川白村的文艺思想是早被他抛弃了的。而胡风却多年来捧为至宝，偷偷地出卖它，这就不能不是胡风的罪过了。
    在我们揭露了这一点之后，还需要深入一步。我们正是从胡风和厨川白村的文艺思想的联系上，窥见了胡风文艺思想的世界观的基础。厨川白村下边的一段话是我们解决这个问题的重要引线。
    厨川白村写道：“将那闪电似的，奔流似的，蓦地，而且几乎是胡乱地突进不息的生命的力，看为人间生活的根本者，是许多近代的思想家所一致的。那以为变化流动即是现实，而说‘创造的进化’的柏格森的哲学不待言，就在勖本华尔（即叔本华）的意志说里，尼采的本能论超人说里，表现在培那特萧（即萧伯纳）的戏曲人与超人里的‘生力’里，嘉本特的承认了人间生命的永远不灭的创造性的‘宇宙底自我’说里，在近来，则如罗素在社会改造的根本义上所说的冲动说里，岂不是统可以窥见‘生命的力’的意义么？”（“苦闷的象征”，第二二页）
    厨川白村明白地说出他的文艺思想和唯心主义的柏格森、意志主义的叔本华、超人哲学的尼采等人的直接渊源关系。这是一个重要的问题。因为这是厨川白村文艺思想的世界观的基础，而这同样地也就是胡风的文艺思想的世界观的基础。从这个基础上看来，厨川白村的文艺思想是近世纪以来资产阶级反动哲学流派的混合物，而胡风恰是也如此。
    这就是胡风的反动文艺思想的一张底牌。揭开了它，胡风的“自我扩张”“主观战斗精神”等等到底是用什么材料塑造起来的，也就可以一目了然。
    现在我们应该分析一下这些反动哲学流派的基本思想，特别是柏格森哲学的基本思想。
    柏格森是法国的哲学家，是近世纪最反动的唯心主义哲学流派中的直觉主义的最重要的代表人物。柏格森哲学的唯心主义的突出表现是在他以生命来“调停”物质与意识的矛盾，而诡辩地以生命来代替并融化物质这一反动观点上。柏格森在他的“生命与意识”一文中详尽地说明了他的观点。他认为：意识和物质是两种根本不同的存在，或两种互相反对的存在，因为物质是必然的，意识是自由的
  （请读者注意，柏格森这“必然”和“自由”和我们讲“必然”和“自由”是完全两回事）；但是生命却有一个方法来调停它们之间的互相反对。这就是生命能于物质的必然中插入意识的自由；利用物质的必然以谋意识的自由。柏格森认为：如果物质一点也不容“放弛”，那就决不能有生命。但是物质不知在什么时候什么地方“略示退步”，“稍现弹力”，于是那个时候和那个地方就是意识这个
  “自由”侵入物质这个“必然”的最好的机会。但是在这个侵入的“最初”，意识还要稍为表示“谦抑”一下，并不立即“突进”，但“一旦侵入”，
  “他就要逐渐膨大，从侵入的那一点，逐渐扩充，不至战胜全体不止。”当意识战胜了物质全体的时候，它就得到了完全的“自由”。这就是生命的广大神通（“生命与意志”，载“哲学杂志”第八期，第十页）。
    显然，这是柏格森在攻击马克思列宁主义的物质论。他是要以生命的概念来取消物质的概念，从马克思列宁主义的观点看来，生命是客观物质世界长期发展的产物。科学证明，宇宙间出现了生命现象，这是经历了不知多少万年的事情。而从柏格森的观点看来，却是有了一个超物质的生命，插入了必然的物质，而获得了意识的自由。在这里柏格森就用生命来取消物质，融化物质，而生命之所以能够这样，就是由于生命的逐渐扩大，逐渐膨胀以至于最后战胜物质全体。这就是柏格森的反对马克思列宁主义所得出来的生命的自我扩张的“理论”。
    关于这个生命自我扩张，柏格森又指出它自己的冲动力。他认为：生命的进化，从他的“发源”到人类，“好像一条意识的大河流，冲着物质流去，一意只想冲开一条地道，或左或右的试验，或多或少的冲进”，而且多半是冲在石头上，伤害了自己。但至少能在一个方向冲开他的道路，以到达光明，“进化到人类”。柏格森认为：一当生命冲到“光明”的人类的时候，这就“镕为个性，最终成为人格”，而这种人格叫做“创造的人格”，是“自己创造自己”的人格。而且这种人格就是在人死了以后，它还要继续存在。柏格森把它叫做“人格之保存”和“人格之扩张”。这就是柏格森反对马克思列宁主义的物质论所得出来由生命的自我扩张而达到的“人格论”和“创化论”的“理论”。
    柏格森的“人格论”和“创化论”极度夸张地描写了生命的自我扩张的魔力。但是生命为什么能这样无限制地自我扩张呢？柏格森认为这是生命的
  “本能”，而在人来说那就是由于人在最初的时候
  “本能”和“智慧”是“混合在一处”，是“互相包含”着的。一有了人的生命，也就有一切。柏格森说：“我们只顺着自然的运行，无须有特别的修养”，“有时我们觉得所求的知识是无穷的远，谁知他就在我们的身旁，不过等着有了时机我们自能发见他。”（同上，第二十页）
    为此，柏格森就坚决地反对人类的科学知识和革命理论的重大作用。柏格森主张人能够本能地直觉地认识到一切，而这一切统统都在他自己的身旁。这就是柏格森反对马克思列宁主义的物质论所得出来的“本能论”和“直觉论”的“理论”。
    从马克思列宁主义观点看来，物质是第一性的，意识是第二性的，第一性的东西决定第二性的东西，而第二性的东西又能给第一性的东西以能动的反作用。而柏格森却否认这个，他认为意识是第一性的，物质是第二性的，意识决定物质。
    在这反动理论的基础上又构成了柏格森的反动的历史观。柏格森的“妙”论是：生命这个东西，在最初的时候就“先知先觉”地知道社会生活的必要性，就知道他的原始的重要的欲望，只能在社会上得到满足。因此，生命就“使个人意志加入于社会意志”。（同上，第八页）据柏格森看来，社会就是个人能力的集合体，社会的一切就是人们的自由意志的自由创造。这是柏格森反对马克思列宁主义的科学历史观而达到了“意志自由论”的“理论”。
    从马克思列宁主义的观点看来，历史是生产发展的历史、阶级斗争的历史，历史的发展是有它自己的规律性的。人要真正达到自由，也就是我们通常所讲的从必然到自由，就要通过生产斗争的实践、阶级斗争的实践，认识这些规律，利用这些规律。为此，总结了生产和阶级斗争的经验、反映历史发展、社会发展的规律性的科学理论就具有特别重要的意义。而柏格森却认为历史的发展只是生命本性的自我扩张，只是人们的意志的自由的创造。
    就是这样，柏格森的哲学思想成了近世纪以来最反动的哲学流派之一，成了最有利于反动的统治阶级，凶暴地反对工人阶级和劳动人民，反对马克思列宁主义科学的革命理论的工具。
    这就是我们对柏格森哲学思想几个基本要点的简单概括。
    就在这些基本要点中已经完全可以看到厨川白村的文艺思想的世界观的基础主要的是什么东西了，从而也可以看到胡风的文艺思想的世界观的基础主要的是什么东西了。厨川白村和胡风的世界观，包含着若干唯心主义哲学流派的混合物，但是他们在文艺思想上所表现出来的主要的东西，却可以使人十分明白地看出他们和柏格森哲学思想的联系。
    虽然胡风从来也没有明白宣布过他是柏格森哲学思想的追随者，而且胡风还可以明白宣布他从来也没有学过柏格森哲学，甚至是柏格森哲学的反对者，但是柏格森的哲学思想却好像一条灰色的线一样贯串在胡风的文艺思想的一系列重要观点之中。
    下面我们将略加分析。
    首先是关于生命或者说是生命力的问题。正如前述，柏格森以生命的概念取消物质概念，以主观的生命代替客观的物质世界，构成了柏格森的主观唯心主义的哲学基础。而在这一点上，胡风和柏格森完全达到一致的结论。在胡风小集团的文艺思想中，作家的“生命力”，是被规定为创作的第一源泉的。这就是说，它是属于第一性的东西，而客观的物质世界是属于第二性的东西（当然作家没有生命是不能从事创作的，但问题是在于作家如果是把自己的生命当作艺术创作的第一性的东西，那就不能不是奇谈怪论了）。在胡风小集团的文章里，主观和生命是异词同义的用语。按照他们的说法，“主观”的东西乃是自然生命力的变质；而客观的东西则又是通过主观才能赢得它的生命。前一说法就是舒芜所说的“人类带着本来的自然生命力……和社会因素有机的化合起来，变质而成‘主观’”（“论主观”，“希望”第一期第六十九页）；后一说法就是胡风所说的“生活事件……通过他底主观的追求或主观的提高而取得更深广的内容，更有思想力的生命”
  （“逆流的日子”第三页）。因此这个主观的生命或生命的主观就是胡风小集团的哲学思想、文艺思想的唯一基础。这就是我们所应得出来的第一个结论。
    第二是关于“自我扩张”、“人格力量”、
  “主观战斗精神”的问题。一当我们弄清了胡风的哲学思想、文艺思想的基础是柏格森的生命力论的时候，那末，这一系列的问题也就迎刃而解了。既然生命力是决定一切的基础，那末，胡风所说的作家的“自我扩张”就不能不是作家的生命力的自我扩张，胡风所说的作家的“人格力量”就不能不是作家的生命力的自我创造和升华。在这种扩张、创造和升华的基础之上就不能不产生出作家的“凶猛地向过去搏斗，悲壮地向未来突进”的“主观战斗精神”。显然，这一切又完全是柏格森哲学思想的反刍。而在这里胡风关于现实主义的“理论”有力地证明了这一点。胡风在“逆流的日子”里写过：“创造过程上的创造主体（作家本身）和创造对象（材料）的相生相克的斗争；主体克服（深入、提高）对象，对象也克服（扩大、纠正）主体，这就是现实主义底最基本的精神。”（“逆流的日子”，第一○五页）显然这个创造的主体，据胡风自己的注解就是作家本身，而作家的本身也就是作家自己的生命力。因此，这种叫做“主体和创造对象的相生相克的斗争”，在实质上只不过是以作家的主观的生命力突入了客观对象而又溶化了、摄取了客观对象的斗争并借此以加强作家生命力的“自我扩张”，昂扬作家的“主观战斗精神”而已。简言之，以主体代替客体，以主观代替客观，这就是胡风小集团的“现实主义”的本质，这也就是胡风小集团的“自我扩张”、“人格力量”和“主观战斗精神”的强大的生命力的基础和源泉，这就是我们所应得出来的第二个结论。
    现在让我们把这两个结论归纳在一起就可以明白看出胡风的哲学思想是彻头彻尾的主观唯心主义，而其基本特征也正和其他主观唯心主义哲学流派一样最终地达到唯我主义的结论。而恰恰是在这个唯我主义哲学的世界观基础之上，构成了多年来和我们党的文艺思想、文艺路线尖锐对立着的胡风小集团反动文艺思想和文艺路线。这就是我们应得出来的第三个结论。
    由此可见，在胡风小集团的作品里充满着轻视和诬蔑人民以至于反人民的气息决不是偶然的。他们把人民看作是虫豸和苍蝇，把人民的革命斗争看作是蠢动着的生活形象，从唯我主义者——“超人”的文学家看来，那是非常恰当的。和柏格森哲学息息相通的尼采就清楚地说过：“人类与其说是目的，不如说只是手段……人类不过是供实验的材料，一大堆多余的废品，一地的破片瓦砾。”
    由此可见，在胡风小集团的文艺作品里充满着对于资产阶级个人主义的形象——例如被胡风称为生命跃动的人生实相的蒋纯祖（路翎：“财主的儿女们”）的人物等等——的热情欢呼也决不是偶然的。因为像蒋纯祖那样的人物，正是按照胡风小集团的资产阶级思想而塑造出来的典型人物的典型性格，他本身所具备的“横可以通全体，直可以由过去通向未来的倾向”，正是胡风小集团的“自我扩张”和“主观战斗精神”。而与此相反，在胡风小集团笔下的疯子式的“工人”、疯子式的“农民”、疯子式的“战士”，这也是完全可以理解的，因为在唯我主义者——“超人”的文学家看来，工人、农民、士兵就是他们所应该以作家的生命力去加以溶化，加以摄取的漆黑一团的感性对象。这些小百姓们，理应“不识不知，顺帝之则”地听候他们的“主观战斗精神”加以恣情任性的摆弄，因为和柏格森哲学思想息息相通的叔本华也清楚地说过：“这个世界，就是我的观念”！
    由此可见，胡风坚决地反对马克思列宁主义的历史唯物主义，反对生产发展和阶级斗争的理论也决不是偶然的。因为从唯我主义者——“超人”的文学家看来，他们本身是具有“卓越”人格和绝对意志的，他们就是历史、社会的创造者。正为此，胡风才把舒芜“论主观”一文称之为“一个使中华民族求新生的斗争会受到影响的问题”。因为舒芜的这篇文章露骨地反对了马克思列宁主义的历史唯物主义的理论，而又高度地发扬了胡风的“主观”或者是“生命力”的“理论”的精神和实质——这个“主观”或者是“生命力”的发展，最后地“真正实现了大宇宙的本性——生生不已的天心”。这对胡风说来，是“实合孤意”的，因为胡风自己就明白地说过：“作家通过自己的精神能力，……创造出一个特异的精神世界”，“他要透过法则底世界去游历精神底世界”，从而可以使“大宇宙”“结晶”在“小宇宙”之中。（“人生、文艺、文艺批评”）
    由此可见，胡风小集团之所以坚决反对马克思列宁主义的理论和构成它的理论基础的科学世界观，也不是偶然的。因为在唯我主义者——“超人”的文学家看来，只有柏格森、叔本华和尼采的哲学思想、只有厨川白村的文艺思想，才是“热烘烘的”，而马克思列宁主义的理论和它的世界观对于他们来说就不能不是“冷冰冰的”或者是“刀子”和“棍子”！
    因此，我们的结论是：胡风和我们党十多年来在文艺战线上所进行的持久斗争，乃是主观唯心主义的世界观和辩证唯物主义的世界观的斗争。而胡风在我们国家正在进行着伟大的社会主义革命和建设的今天，凶暴地突击地提出他的反对社会主义的纲领，正是在他的反动的唯心主义世界观指示之下的资产阶级思想向着工人阶级和它的先锋队——中国共产党，同时也是向着全国人民的进攻！
