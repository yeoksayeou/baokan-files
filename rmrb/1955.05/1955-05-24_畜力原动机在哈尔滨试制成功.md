The Harbin Farm Implement Factory has successfully trial-produced an animal-powered prime mover. The animal-powered prime mover is used to drive ordinary hand-cranked or foot-pedaled rice threshers, corn shellers, and chaff cutters. In situations where steam power cannot be universally adopted, animal-powered prime movers are suitable for use in the vast rural areas of our country. After the successful trial production of the animal-powered prime mover, it underwent testing and evaluation in the rural areas of Harbin City's suburbs. Using the pulling power of two oxen, it can thresh 17,280 *jin* of rice grains in eight hours, which is three and a half times more efficient than the foot-pedaled rice threshers previously used by farmers. During the evaluation, the farmers also put forward some suggestions for improvement. The specifications have now been finalized and mass production has begun. (Our Harbin Correspondent)

　　畜力原动机在哈尔滨试制成功
    哈尔滨农具厂试制畜力原动机成功。畜力原动机是带动一般手摇或脚蹬的脱谷机、苞米脱粒机、铡草机等用的。在不能普遍采用蒸汽动力的情况下，畜力原动机是适合我国广大农村采用的。畜力原动机试制成功以后，经过哈尔滨市郊农村的试验和鉴定，用两头牛的拉力八小时能脱稻粒一万七千二百八十市斤，比原来农民使用的脚蹬脱谷机的效率提高了三倍半。在鉴定时，农民们又提出了一些改进意见。现在已经最后确定规格，并开始成批地生产。　（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
