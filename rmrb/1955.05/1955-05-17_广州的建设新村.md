　　Going east from Yuexiu Bridge in Guangzhou, and passing a newly built, wide road – Zao Bi Chang Road (Mint Factory Road), Construction New Village quickly comes into view.

　　A little over three years ago, this was still a barren mountain. Beginning in 1952, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government allocated funds to build worker housing here, and the barren mountain began to change its appearance. Now, along the newly opened three main roads, there are sixty-two brand new bungalows; on the small hill in the southeast corner, there are also three large buildings, forming a new village built according to plan – "Construction New Village."

　　More than four thousand seven hundred construction workers and their families live in the new village. They use their labor every day to participate in the city's construction work. However, before liberation, their own living places were thatched sheds, straw houses, or the roadside and under bridges. Only after liberation could they enjoy the fruits of their labor, have their own housing, and have their own new village.

　　In a spacious building on the north side of the new village, three hundred and seventy primary school students are happily learning and playing. This is the Dongqu (Eastern District) No. 7 Primary School, established specifically for the children of workers in the new village. To the south, another new type of school building has already begun construction. Next to the First Construction New Village Road, a new sports field has been opened, built by the workers during their rest time.

　　Here, the streets are swept very clean. Last year, the Municipal Construction Bureau renovated a river channel in front of the village into a large open drain about ten meters wide and more than two thousand two hundred meters long, and rebuilt two bridges spanning the river channel, greatly improving the traffic conditions and environmental sanitation in the Construction New Village area.

　　In the past two years, several thousand saplings have been planted in the new village. Now, on both sides of the roads and in the courtyards, many eucalyptus, stone chestnuts, and shadow trees sway in the early summer sun, making the new village even more beautiful.

　　The Henglu (Horizontal Road) area of Construction New Village is particularly lively. Grain supply stations, consumer cooperatives, bank savings offices, and postal agencies are all located here. It is very convenient to buy grain, vegetables, and daily necessities here.

　　In the early morning, the workers who live here eat breakfast, and together they take their unit's cars to the construction site; many workers' children also carry their schoolbags to school. Some family members take care of household chores, and others participate in literacy classes to learn culture. In the evening, loudspeakers broadcast music, and young people begin to carry out recreational activities: some practice soccer or basketball, and some practice Cantonese opera in the auditorium. Most of the older people like to chat in the courtyards, and the children play in groups on the grass.

　　I visited Li Hong, a worker from the Construction Bureau who had recently married, in Dongliu Street. The house he lives in is just an ordinary family dormitory in the new village. Inside, there is a living room, a bedroom, and a kitchen with a bathroom. Talking about the house, he said: "The house is spacious, bright, and cool, and it is very comfortable to live in. Before liberation, I, like many fellow workers, lived by the roadside under the Haizhu Bridge. I never dreamed of living in such a good house today!"

### 广州的建设新村

　　广州的建设新村
　　舜言
    由广州市越秀桥东行，经过一条新修好的宽阔的道路——造币厂路，建设新村很快就展现在眼前。
    三年多之前，这里还是一片荒山。一九五二年起，广州市人民政府拨款在这里兴建工人住宅，荒山开始改变面貌了。现在，在新开辟的三条大马路的两旁，排列着六十二座崭新的平房；在东南角的小山岗上还有三座大楼房，已形成了一个按计划建设起来的新的村庄——“建设新村”。
    新村里住着四千七百多名建筑工人和他们的家属。他们天天用自己的劳动参加城市的建设工作。可是，在解放前，他们自己住的地方却是茅棚、草房，或者是路边、桥底。只有在解放后，他们才能享受到自己劳动的果实，才有自己的住宅，有自己的新村。
    新村北面的一座宽阔的楼房里，有三百七十个小学生正在愉快地学习、游戏着。这是专为新村的工人子弟设立的东区第七小学。南面，另一座新型的校舍已经开始建筑。新村第一马路旁边，新开辟了一个运动场，这是工人们利用休息时间修建的。
    这里，街道打扫得很洁净。去年，市建设局把村面前的一条河涌修成了一条约十公尺阔、二千二百多公尺长的大明渠，并且改建了横跨河涌的两座桥，大大改善了新村一带的交通状况和环境卫生。
    两年来，新村里种植了好几千棵树苗。现在，在马路两旁、院子里，许多细叶桉、石栗和影树，在初夏的阳光中，随风摇曳，把新村点缀得更加美丽。
    新村的建设横路一带格外热闹。粮食供应站、消费合作社、银行储蓄所、邮政代办所都设在这里。在这里买粮食、菜蔬和日用品都很方便。
    清晨，住在这里的工人吃过早点，大伙儿一起坐上自己单位的汽车到工地去；许多工人的孩子也带着书包去上学。家属们有的料理家务，有的参加识字班学习文化。傍晚，扩音器播送着音乐，青年们开始进行文娱活动：有的练习足球或者篮球，有的在礼堂里练习粤曲。上了年纪的人大都喜欢在院子里聊天，孩子们成群结队地在草地上玩耍。
    我到东六街访问了结婚不久的建设局工人黎洪。他住的房子不过是新村里一间普通的家庭宿舍。里面有一个客房，一间睡房，一间连浴室的厨房。谈到房子，他说：“房子宽敞、光亮，又凉爽，住得很舒适。解放前，我和许多工友一样，住在海珠桥底的路边，做梦也想不到有今天这样好的房子住！”
