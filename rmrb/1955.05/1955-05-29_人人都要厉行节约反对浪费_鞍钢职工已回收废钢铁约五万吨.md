Everyone Should Practice Thrift and Oppose Waste
Anshan Iron and Steel Workers Have Recovered Approximately 50,000 Tons of Scrap Steel

To the Editor:

    Since the People's Daily, Liaoning Daily, and Anshan Worker's Life News successively published criticisms of the serious waste of scrap steel at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed the above two units to earnestly organize workers to recover scrap steel.  Starting in mid-March, the work of recovering scrap steel has been launched in more than 40 factories and mines (workshops) affiliated with the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and in various engineering companies and construction sites affiliated with the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company. As of May 15, approximately 50,000 tons of scrap steel have been recovered.

    "Recovering a bit of steel is adding a bit of strength to socialist construction!"  This slogan has inspired every worker to take active action.  The Communist Youth League members and young people have become an active shock force in this work.  To date, they have organized 206 youth labor teams, with more than 20,000 young workers standing at the forefront of this work.  The Communist Youth League organization of the Steel Rolling Engineering Company assisted the Party in mobilizing more than 600 young workers who used their spare time to pick up 828 tons of scrap steel, 15 tons of non-ferrous metals, and more than 800 tools. The active actions of the young people motivated many older workers.  Old scaffolder Wang Shaoshan was very excited to see young workers enthusiastically signing up to participate in voluntary labor to recover scrap steel and said, "You young people love the country, and we old people also love the country, let's work together."

    In the work of recovering scrap steel, a large number of previously discarded useful materials were discovered.  For example, the Primary Rolling Mill cleaned out three tons of steel plates of various specifications and three scales that were bought for 180,000 yuan but never used.  Zou Kuishi and more than 20 other people from the blower section of the power construction site of the Blast Furnace Engineering Company cleaned out more than 30 tons of various useful materials. After repair, eight tons of materials have now been used on the No. 5 blast furnace.  The Transportation Department cleaned out three electric motors, and after slight repair, one has been used in production.  The Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company has recovered more than 2,500 tools, more than 9,000 kilograms of rivets, one 20-ton winch, more than 500 kilograms of brand-new cables, several boxes of unused new screws, a new steel cable worth 1,000 yuan, as well as many channel steels, angle irons, and various parts, flange plates, gears, etc. urgently needed for engineering.

    These facts are a vivid and powerful education for the leading cadres of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company.  There were serious loopholes in the materials management work of these two companies in the past, and if they are not determined to be plugged, they will bring significant losses to the country.  It should be pointed out that some units of these two companies still have waste of steel.  On April 11, a construction site of the Steel Rolling Company actually filled more than 300 tons of scrap steel stored on the original site into the soil because a new project was to be built. On April 15, there were still some non-ferrous metal materials and finished products in the garbage dump of the Power Supply Plant.  In this way, while the vast majority of workers are carrying out intensive recovery work, others are abandoning steel, and waste cannot be completely eliminated.  It is hoped that the leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company will further study this issue in order to completely eliminate this waste.

### 人人都要厉行节约反对浪费  鞍钢职工已回收废钢铁约五万吨

    人人都要厉行节约反对浪费
    鞍钢职工已回收废钢铁约五万吨编辑同志：
    自从人民日报、辽宁日报和鞍山工人生活报先后对鞍山钢铁公司和鞍山钢铁建设公司大量浪费废钢铁的现象提出了批评以后，中共鞍山市委员会就责成以上两个单位认真组织职工回收废钢铁。从三月中旬开始，回收废钢铁的工作已经在鞍山钢铁公司所属的四十多个厂矿（车间）和鞍山钢铁建设公司所属各个工程公司、工地中展开了；到五月十五日为止，已回收了约五万吨废钢铁。
    “回收一点钢铁，就是为社会主义建设增加一分力量！”这个口号鼓舞着每个职工积极行动起来。青年团员和青年们在这个工作中成为一个活跃的突击力量。到目前为止，他们已组织了二百零六个青年劳动队，有两万多名青年职工站在这一工作的前列。炼钢工程公司青年团组织协助党动员了六百多名青年职工，利用业余时间拣了废钢铁八百二十八吨，有色金属十五吨，工具八百多件。青年们的积极行动带动了很多年老的工人。老架工王少山看到青年职工都踊跃报名参加回收废钢铁的义务劳动，很激动地说：“你们青年爱国，我们老年也爱国，咱们一起干吧。”
    在回收废钢铁的工作中，发现了大批过去被遗弃的有用器材。如初轧厂清理出规格不同的钢板三吨，用十八万元买来而一次未用过的磅秤三台。高炉工程公司动力工地鼓风工段邹奎仕等二十多人清理出三十多吨各种有用材料，经过修理，目前已有八吨材料用到第五号高炉上。运输部清理出三台电动机，略加修理后已有一台用在生产上了。鞍山钢铁建设公司已回收工具二千五百多件，铆钉九千多公斤，二十吨卷扬机一台，五百多公斤崭新的电缆，没有使用过的新螺丝几箱，价值一千元的新钢绳一条，另外还有不少槽钢、角铁和工程上急需的各种零件、法蓝盘、齿轮等。
    这些事实对鞍山钢铁公司和鞍山钢铁建设公司的领导干部是一次生动有力的教育。这两个公司过去材料管理工作中有着严重的漏洞，如果不决心加以堵塞，会给国家带来重大的损失。应该指出，现在这两个公司的个别单位仍有浪费钢铁的现象。四月十一日，轧钢公司某工地因为要建设一项新工程，竟把原地存放着的三百多吨废钢铁填入土中；四月十五日，在电供厂的垃圾堆里，仍有一些有色金属材料和成品。这样，一面广大职工在紧张地进行回收工作，另一面又有人在把钢铁废弃，浪费现象是不能彻底消灭的。希望鞍山钢铁公司和鞍山钢铁建设公司领导方面进一步研究这个问题，以求彻底消灭这种浪费现象。　　鞍山工人生活报社　薛恩勤
