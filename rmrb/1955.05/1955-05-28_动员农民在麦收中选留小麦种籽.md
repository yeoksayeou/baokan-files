Mobilizing farmers to select and retain seeds for their own use is the main method to solve the problems of low seed quality and insufficient quantity. Now, winter wheat is about to mature in the main winter wheat producing areas of the Huai River and Yellow River basins. The agricultural production departments in these areas should, in conjunction with the wheat harvest work, mobilize farmers to select and retain appropriate wheat seeds.

Some rural workers underestimate the work of selecting and retaining wheat seeds, believing that even if wheat seeds are not selected and retained now, it will be too late to collect them temporarily in the fall. This erroneous idea has already caused serious harm to agricultural production. Last year, the Yuci area of Shanxi Province temporarily collected spring wheat seeds and distributed mixed wheat seeds to farmers. Because there were a large number of winter wheat seedlings in the spring wheat fields, it caused significant losses to farmers and damaged the prestige of the Party and the government. This year, during the spring sowing season, some agricultural production cooperatives lacked self-retained seeds, which also caused great difficulties, resulting in severe seedling shortages in the spring-sown fields.

Some rural workers say that if seeds are not selected now, the state will supply them at that time. Indeed, the state agricultural departments attach great importance to supplying farmers with seeds and have done a lot of work over the years. However, the state agricultural departments cannot grasp the farm varieties scattered in various regions, which are often only suitable for the local natural environment. The state agricultural departments can only gradually test and gradually promote some improved varieties with greater adaptability. Therefore, the most practical way to solve the seed problem at present is to mobilize farmers to select and retain them themselves. Agricultural production cooperatives should take the lead in selecting and retaining wheat seeds; cooperatives preparing to establish winter wheat seed retention plots can also use the method of field ear selection to select and retain the seeds needed in the seed retention plots.

Some rural workers believe that selecting and retaining wheat seeds is necessary. However, they only value improved varieties such as "Bima No. 1" and "Nanda 2419," and look down on the large number of relatively good local farm varieties that are suitable for the natural environment of various regions. These local improved farm varieties scattered in various places generally have the advantage of higher yields, and also have properties such as resistance to insects, disease, wind, drought, and cold. Before introducing better varieties from other regions, these relatively good local varieties should all become the object of selection and retention.

The planting area of local improved farm varieties is often very small, and some are concentrated in a relatively narrow area; therefore, when mobilizing farmers to select and retain wheat seeds, exchanges within a certain range should be encouraged in order to adjust surpluses and deficiencies and gradually promote them. The organization of seed exchange should adhere to the principle of mutual benefit and should pay attention to the adaptability of the seeds.

### 动员农民在麦收中选留小麦种籽

    动员农民在麦收中选留小麦种籽
    赵起
    发动农民选留自用的种籽，是解决种籽质量不高、数量不足的问题的主要方法。现在，淮河流域和黄河流域各个冬小麦主要产区的小麦就要成熟了，这些地区的农业生产部门，应该结合麦收工作，发动农民选留适当的麦种。
    有些农村工作人员轻视选留麦种的工作，认为现在即使没有选留麦种，到秋季临时筹集也来得及。这种错误思想已给农业生产造成严重的祸害。山西榆次专区去年临时收集春麦种籽，把混杂麦种发给农民；由于春小麦田中有很大数量的冬小麦麦苗，给农民造成重大的损失，损害了党和政府的威信。今年春播时候，有些农业生产合作社缺乏自留的种籽，也发生了很大的困难，造成春播田严重缺苗的现象。
    有些农村工作人员说，现在不来选留种籽，到时候国家会供应的。的确，国家的农业部门是很重视供应农民种籽的，历年来也做了许多工作。但是国家农业部门不可能掌握分散在各个地区的、常常只适合当地自然环境的农家品种。国家农业部门对某些适应性较大的优良品种，只能陆续试验，逐步推广。因此，目前解决种籽问题的最切实的办法是动员农民自己选留。农业生产合作社应该带头进行选留麦种；准备建立冬小麦留种地的社，还可以用田间穗选的方法，选留留种地中需要的种籽。
    有些农村工作人员认为选留麦种是必要的。但是，他们只重视像“碧蚂一号”“南大二四一九”等优良品种，而看不起大量的适合各个不同地区自然环境的比较优良的农家品种。这些分散在各地的农家良种，一般都具有产量较高的优点，并且分别具有抗虫、抗病、抗风、耐旱、耐寒等性能。在没有从外区引进更好的品种以前，当地的这些比较好的品种，都应该成为选留的对象。
    农家优良品种的种植面积常常很小，有的并且集中在一个比较狭小的地区；因此，动员农民选留麦种时，应该提倡一定范围内的串换，以便调剂有无，逐步推广。组织种子串换要掌握互利的原则，并应注意种籽的适应性。
