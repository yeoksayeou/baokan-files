　  Xinhua News Agency, London, May 23rd: Over 17,000 dockworkers belonging to the British National Amalgamated Stevedores and Dockers Union simultaneously launched a strike today in five major British ports—London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birkenhead, and Hull. They are demanding that employers formally recognize the union's right to represent its members in negotiations with the employers. So far, in ports other than London, only the Transport and General Workers' Union, controlled by right-wing union bosses, has the right to represent dockworkers.

　  It is reported that British Prime Minister Eden interrupted his election campaign on the 20th and rushed back to London in an attempt to prevent this strike and the railway workers' strike scheduled to begin on May 28th. However, despite this, the dockworkers began their strike as planned.

　  The right-wing leaders of the British Trades Union Congress stand with the government and employers, pressuring the dockworkers to abandon their struggle for legitimate rights. The heads of the Transport and General Workers' Union have even ordered their members to boycott the strike. However, the strike is still supported by many dockworkers belonging to the Transport and General Workers' Union.

　  英国一万多名码头工人罢工
    新华社二十三日讯　伦敦消息：属于英国全国码头工人工会联合会的一万七千个码头工人，二十三日起在英国的五大港口——伦敦、利物浦、曼彻斯特、柏肯黑德、赫尔——同时举行罢工，要求资方正式承认这一工会有权代表其所属工人同资方进行谈判。到目前为止，除伦敦以外的其他港口，只有为右翼工会头子所把持的运输与普通工人工会有权代表码头工人。
    据报道，英国首相艾登在二十日中止了竞选旅行，特地赶回伦敦，企图阻止这次罢工和预定要在五月二十八日开始的铁路工人罢工。但是，尽管这样，码头工人仍然按照原订计划开始了罢工。
    英国职工大会的右翼领导同政府和资方站在一起，压迫码头工人放弃争取合法权利的斗争；运输与普通工人工会的头子们更命令所属会员抵制这次罢工。但是罢工仍然得到属于运输与普通工人工会的许多码头工人的支持。
