　　The Western Colonial Countries' Aggression Against the People of Asia and Africa
　　Zhang Zhirui
　　In the past few centuries, Western colonial countries have carried out bloody colonial plunder against the people of Asia and Africa. Especially in the last hundred years, Western imperialist countries have strengthened their colonial rule over Asian and African countries, causing even deeper disasters for the people of the colonies.
　　As early as the end of the fifteenth century, with the birth of the bourgeoisie in Western countries, they began colonial plunder. The geographical discoveries at that time promoted the expansion of European merchants into Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They trafficked slaves from Africa, turned Indonesia into a colony, established colonial rule in some parts of India, and occupied the Philippines. They carried out piratical plunder, monopolized trade with the East, subjected local residents to extra-economic exploitation, and turned the Asia-Africa region into a commodity sales market and a source of raw materials for Western colonial countries.
　　After the 1870s, world capitalism developed into the stage of imperialism, monopoly organizations emerged, and financial capital groups further strengthened their plunder of the colonies, especially in Asia and Africa.
　　The last two decades of the nineteenth century were an important period for imperialist plunder and division of Africa. Britain mainly advanced from East and South Africa, and France advanced from West Africa. Germany and other colonial countries also seized land in order to plunder African resources. In the early 1880s, France occupied Tunisia, connecting it with Algeria, which it had already occupied, and Britain occupied Egypt, turning it into a British protectorate. Later, a fierce struggle for Central and South Africa unfolded among Western colonial countries. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Britain had invaded and occupied Sudan, the East Africa Protectorate, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, Bechuanaland, South Africa, and Nigeria and the Gold Coast in the Gulf of Guinea. France had invaded and occupied West Africa, Equatorial Africa, Madagascar, Morocco, etc. Belgium had invaded and occupied the Congo. Germany had established colonial rule in East Africa, Southwest Africa, and Cameroon, Togo, etc. Portugal also seized many places. The whole of Africa was almost completely divided up by imperialist countries.
　　During this period, various imperialist countries were also actively investing in Asia, vying for spheres of influence, establishing military strategic bases, and intensifying colonial plunder, making the situation in various parts of Asia extremely tense. Indonesia, India, Ceylon, etc., had long become colonies of the Netherlands and Britain. Burma, Vietnam, Malaya, etc., also became colonies of Britain and France in the 1880s. The Philippines became a colony of the United States after the Spanish-American War in 1898. Siam was divided into spheres of influence by Britain and France. Korea became a protectorate of Japan. Afghanistan became a British sphere of influence. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Iran had finally become a sphere of influence for Britain and Russia. The vast areas of Asia, except for Japan, became colonies or semi-colonies. China became a place of fierce competition among imperialists.
　　In the last half-century, in order to compete for world hegemony and redivide the colonies, the imperialist countries launched two world wars. After two cruel wars, the division of world colonies changed. The United States, Britain, France, and other countries redivided the colonies of defeated countries such as Germany, Japan, and Italy. In particular, American imperialism intensified its colonial expansion on a global scale. Post-World War II Japan is no longer an independent country; it is now in a state of semi-occupation by the American army.
　　America's colonialist plunder plan is closely linked to its ambition to dominate the world. At the very beginning of the twentieth century, American imperialism already believed that the Pacific Ocean should become an "American lake," and the time had come for the United States to pursue a large-scale expansion policy around the world. Because the United States was a late-rising imperialist power, it put forward the so-called "Open Door" principle, demanding that other imperialist countries agree to open the door to the United States in their colonies and semi-colonies, allowing the United States to infiltrate these countries and establish its colonial influence. The "Open Door" policy was first aimed at China.
　　In order to achieve the purpose of competing for colonies and spheres of influence and enslaving backward countries, the United States has repeatedly launched wars of aggression. In 1898, the United States launched the first imperialist war to redivide the world. After defeating Spain, it seized the Philippines and turned it into an American colony, while also occupying Guam. Then, American invading troops came to China and participated in the imperialist burning, killing, and looting of the Chinese people. It was only due to the angry resistance of the Chinese people that China was spared being divided up. Since then, the United States has actively expanded in the Far East, especially in China. The United States invested in China, massively sold commodities, supervised Chinese finances, controlled the Chinese reactionary government, and intensified cultural aggression, attempting to squeeze out the influence of other imperialist countries in China. During the Second World War, Japan's aggressive activities in the Far East frustrated the aggressive forces of the United States in the Far East, but after the war, the United States completely controlled Nationalist China until the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution completely eradicated the aggressive forces of the United States from the Chinese mainland. However, the United States continues to increase its influence in other parts of Asia, squeezing out the influence of countries such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands. For example, the United States is trying its best to extend its aggressive forces to some countries in Southeast Asia. In Iran, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and other places, the United States has obtained oil exploitation rights. The United States lends, invests, and exports commodities to Turkey, strengthens investment activities in other Asian countries, etc. American capital has expanded to vast areas of Asia except for people's democratic countries.
　　The American colonial plunder of Africa also has a long history and is constantly expanding. As early as the mid-nineteenth century, the United States transplanted some blacks to the west coast of Africa and established a protectorate, Liberia. It became a stronghold for American aggression in Africa. In 1906, in the struggle between Germany and France for control of Morocco, the United States used the "Open Door" policy to participate in the investment of various imperialists in Morocco. Since then, American capital has gradually invaded the entire African continent, getting involved in Africa's rich mineral resources and other industrial raw materials, and has become one of the main forces controlling the banking, transportation, and other undertakings of some African countries. Especially during the Second World War and the post-war period, the influence of the United States in Africa has grown rapidly. American monopoly capital closely follows behind American "aid," gaining control over South Africa's uranium, Congo's copper, and other rich deposits. American oil monopoly capital has extended its plundering hand into almost every country in Africa. In some places, American monopoly capital has formed partnerships with older British and French capital to carry out plunder together, while making British and French capital increasingly submissive to it.
　　All of America's colonial plunder is cloaked in beautiful clothes. The American ruling group consistently portrays itself as anti-colonialist and concerned about the independence and freedom of all countries. This is a great deception, the purpose of which is to deceive the people of Asia and Africa, so that they cannot see the oppression and plunder of the United States, and to facilitate the use of the human and material resources of Asia and Africa to serve the war policy of the United States in order to realize its ambition to dominate the world. During the Asian-African Conference, the active sabotage activities of the United States once again proved that American imperialism is the main enemy of the people of Asia and Africa.
　　The people of Asian and African countries, who account for more than half of the world's population, have different nationalities, different skin colors, different beliefs, and speak many different languages. Today, there are still different social systems, but all of these cannot affect the common destiny and common aspirations of the people of Asia and Africa. We have all suffered or are still suffering from colonial oppression, and we all hate and oppose this colonialism. In order to oppose colonial enslavement, the people of Asia and Africa have continuously struggled. After the First World War and the October Socialist Revolution, the imperialist colonial system was already in crisis. After the Second World War, the crisis of the imperialist colonial system was further deepened. In particular, the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution opened a huge gap in imperialist colonial rule. The struggle of the people of Asia and Africa for national independence has unfolded more vigorously. It was this development that led to the convening of the Asian-African Conference. This conference condemned colonialism, condemned foreign conquest, rule, and exploitation, and expressed support for the cause of freedom and independence of all people bound by colonialism. This is a new encouragement to the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa against colonialism. It is becoming increasingly difficult for imperialism to continue its enslavement and plunder of the people of Asia and Africa.

　　西方殖民国家对亚非人民的侵略
　　张之芮
    过去数百年间，西方殖民国家对于亚非人民进行了血腥的殖民掠夺。特别是近百年来，西方帝国主义国家加强了对亚非各国的殖民统治，给殖民地人民造成更加深重的灾难。
    早在十五世纪末，随着西方各国资产阶级的诞生，它们就开始了殖民掠夺。当时的地理大发现，促进了欧洲商人向非洲、亚洲以及美洲的扩张。它们从非洲贩运奴隶，把印度尼西亚变成殖民地，在印度的某些地区建立殖民统治和占领菲律宾。它们进行海盗式的掠夺，垄断对东方的贸易，对当地居民进行超经济的剥削，并且使亚非地区变为西方殖民国家的商品销售市场和工业原料的供应地。
    十九世纪七十年代以后，世界资本主义向着帝国主义阶段发展，垄断组织产生了，金融资本集团进一步加强对殖民地的掠夺，其中特别突出的是对亚、非两洲的掠夺。
    十九世纪最后二十多年是帝国主义掠夺和瓜分非洲的重要时期。英国主要是从非洲东部和南部，法国从非洲西部分别推进。德国以及其他殖民国家也为了掠夺非洲富源而强占土地。八十年代初，法国占领了突尼斯，同它原来占有的阿尔及利亚连接了起来，英国占领了埃及，把它变成为英国的保护国。以后在西方殖民国家间展开了争夺中非和南非的尖锐斗争。到二十世纪初期，英国侵占了苏丹、东非保护国、南北罗得西亚、贝专纳、南非以及几内亚湾的尼日利亚、黄金海岸等，法国侵占了西非洲、赤道非洲、马达加斯加岛、摩洛哥等，比利时侵占了刚果，德国在东非、西南非以及喀麦隆、多哥等地建立了殖民统治，葡萄牙也夺取了许多地方，整个非洲几乎被帝国主义国家瓜分完了。
    这个时期，各个帝国主义国家也在亚洲积极进行投资，争夺势力范围，建立军事战略基地，加紧殖民主义的掠夺，使得亚洲各地的局势异常地紧张起来。印度尼西亚、印度、锡兰等早已成为荷、英两国的殖民地。缅甸、越南、马来亚等在十九世纪八十年代也变成英、法的殖民地。菲律宾在一八九八年美西战争以后，成为美国的殖民地。暹罗被英法划分了势力范围。朝鲜变成了日本的保护国。阿富汗成为英国的势力范围。到了二十世纪初期，伊朗也终于成为英国和俄国的势力范围。亚洲广大地区，除了日本以外，其余的国家都成了殖民地或者半殖民地。中国成了帝国主义激烈角逐的场所。
    最近半世纪之内，各帝国主义国家为了争夺世界霸权，重新瓜分殖民地，发动了两次世界大战。经过两次残酷的战争，世界殖民地的分割情况有了变化，美、英、法等国重新分割了战败的德、日、意等国的殖民地。特别是美国帝国主义加紧了它在世界范围内的殖民扩张。二次大战以后的日本，也已经不是一个独立的国家，它现在正处于被美国军队半占领的状态。
    美国的殖民主义掠夺计划，是同它的妄图称霸世界的野心密切相连的。二十世纪刚开始，美帝国主义就已经认为太平洋应该成为“美国湖”，美国在全世界推行大规模扩张政策的时期，已经到来了。由于美国是后起的帝国主义，它就提出了所谓“门户开放”原则，要求其他帝国主义国家同意在它们统治下的殖民地和半殖民地对美国打开门户，容许美国渗入这些国家，建立它的殖民势力。而这个“门户开放”政策的提出，首先是针对中国的。
    为了达到争夺殖民地和势力范围以及奴役落后国家的目的，美国曾多次地进行了侵略战争。一八九八年，美国发动了第一次帝国主义重新瓜分世界的战争，在打败西班牙以后，夺取了菲律宾并把它变为美国的殖民地，同时又占领了关岛。接着，美国侵略军队就来到中国，参加了帝国主义对中国人民的烧杀劫掠。仅仅是由于中国人民的愤怒反抗，才使中国免于被瓜分。此后，美国积极地在远东特别是在中国进行扩张。美国在中国投资、大量推销商品、监督中国财政，控制中国反动政府，加紧文化侵略等，企图排挤其他帝国主义国家在中国的势力。第二次世界大战期间，日本在远东展开的侵略活动，使美国在远东的侵略势力受到了挫折，但是在战后，美国就完全控制了国民党中国，直到中国人民革命的胜利，才彻底从中国大陆铲除了美国的侵略势力。但是，美国在亚洲其他地方，却继续增强它的影响，排挤英、法、荷等国的势力。例如美国竭力向东南亚一些国家伸展其侵略势力。在伊朗、阿富汗、沙特阿拉伯等地，美国都取得了石油开采权。美国对土耳其贷款、投资、输出商品，加强对其他亚洲国家的投资活动等等，美国资本已经扩张到了除人民民主国家以外的亚洲广大地区。
    美国对非洲的殖民掠夺也是由来已久而且不断扩大。早在十九世纪中叶，美国把一些黑人移殖到非洲西海岸，建立了一个保护国利比里亚。成为美国侵略非洲的一个据点。一九○六年，美国在德法争夺对摩洛哥控制权的斗争中，利用“门户开放”政策，参加了各帝国主义对摩洛哥的投资。以后美国资本就一步步侵入整个非洲大陆，染指于非洲丰富的矿产和其他工业原料，并且成为控制非洲一些国家银行、交通等事业的主要势力之一。特别是在第二次世界大战及战后时期，美国在非洲的势力迅速增长。美国垄断资本紧跟在美国的“援助”后面，取得了对南非的铀、刚果的铜等等富藏的支配地位。美国的石油垄断资本把掠夺的手伸进了非洲的差不多每一个国家。在一些地方，美国垄断资本同较老的英法资本结成伙伴，一同进行掠夺，同时正使得英法资本愈来愈对它屈服。
    所有美国的殖民主义掠夺，都披上了美丽的外衣，美国统治集团一贯地把自己说成是反对殖民主义的，是关心各国的独立和自由的，这是一个极大的欺骗，目的是要蒙蔽亚非人民，使他们看不到美国对他们的压榨和掠夺，并便于把亚非两洲的人力、物力资源，为美国的战争政策服务，以实现它称霸世界的野心。亚非会议期间，美国的积极破坏活动，又
  一次证明了美国帝国主义是亚非人民的主要敌人。
    占世界人口半数以上的亚非各国人民，有着不同的民族，不同的肤色，不同的信仰，说着多种不同的语言，今天，还存在着不同的社会制度，但是所有这些，都不能影响亚非人民的共同的命运和共同的愿望。我们都遭受过或仍然遭受着殖民主义的压迫，我们都憎恶而且反对这个殖民主义。为了反对殖民主义的奴役，亚非人民曾不断地进行了斗争。第一次世界大战和十月社会主义革命以后，帝国主义的殖民体系即已发生危机。第二次世界大战以后，帝国主义的殖民体系的危机进一步加深，特别是中国人民革命的胜利，给帝国主义的殖民统治，打开了一个巨大的缺口。亚非人民争取民族独立的斗争更加蓬勃地展开。正是这种发展导致了亚非会议的召开。这个会议谴责了殖民主义，谴责了外国的征服、统治和剥削，并表示支持一切受到这些殖民主义束缚的人民的自由和独立的事业。这是对亚非人民反对殖民主义的斗争的一个新的鼓舞。帝国主义要想继续对亚非人民的奴役和掠夺是愈来愈困难了。
