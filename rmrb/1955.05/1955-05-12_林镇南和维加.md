　　Lin Zhennan and Vega
　　By our reporter Lin Gang's Best Friend
    Lin Zhennan’s best friend was moving, and Lin Zhennan followed his parents to see the house. As they entered the courtyard, a Soviet boy was getting water from the tap, not very tall, wearing a peaked cap and a sailor's uniform. Seeing them coming, he politely asked, "Hello! Are you moving here to live?" Lin Zhennan had been playing with Soviet children since he was a child and could speak fluent Russian. He replied, "Yes." The Soviet child said, "Great, we'll be friends from now on. I've wanted to make a Chinese friend for a long time." Lin Zhennan thought so too. He walked over and introduced himself, "My name is Lin Zhennan." The Soviet child said, "My name is Vega." The two shook hands and kissed each other on the cheek. Vega said happily, "We will become the best of friends."
    Thus began the friendship between Lin Zhennan and Vega. In Lushun, every Chinese child had a Soviet friend, and every Soviet child had a Chinese friend.
    Vega's family lived upstairs, and Lin Zhennan's family lived downstairs. After they became neighbors, they worked, played, and studied together every day. That year, Lin Zhennan was twelve years old and Vega was eleven years old, both fourth-graders. They both loved helping their mothers with housework at home. Getting up early, the two of them would sweep the yard together. Lin Zhennan chopped wood, and Vega would help; Vega carried water, and Lin Zhennan would help. Once, Lin Zhennan took a rope and sickle to go up the mountain to cut grass and ran into Vega, who also wanted to go. Lin Zhennan wouldn't let him. Vega said, "Haven't we become friends? Friends should help each other." Lin Zhennan had nothing to say and had to agree. Vega went upstairs, changed into old clothes, old pants, and a pair of Warrior shoes. The two went up the mountain together, and Lin Zhennan asked, "Can you do it?" Vega said, "Let's start!" At first, Lin Zhennan cut much faster, but later Vega caught up.
    One Sunday, Vega and his classmates came to find Lin Zhennan to play. Lin Zhennan apologized, saying that he couldn't go because he had to help his mother build a small wooden shed for storing things. When Vega heard this, he said, "We won't go play either. Let's help you build the small wooden shed together." The other classmates also said, "Yes, let's build the small wooden shed first and then play together." How happily the children worked! One carried mud, the other carried water; this one sawed wood, that one installed it. The mother prepared a meal of noodles for these "bricklayers and carpenters." From nine in the morning to three in the afternoon, a beautiful small wooden shed was built.
    Soon, Lin Zhennan and Vega became the best of friends. Vega's father was a naval officer, and his mother was a Soviet middle school teacher. They also loved Vega's honest and hardworking new friend very much. Vega's father often took out Soviet pictorials to tell them stories of the Great Patriotic War, the lives of Soviet soldiers, and the communist construction of the Soviet Union. They also gave Lin Zhennan a Soviet name, "Guoxia."
    Arithmetic Notebook
    Vega studied at a Soviet school and was an excellent student, enthusiastic, brave, and persistent. Since coming to China, his mother often said to him:
  "Help Chinese children and learn from Chinese children." He kept these words firmly in his heart.
    One day, Vega came to find Lin Zhennan to play and found him doing homework. He casually flipped open his arithmetic notebook and saw that the notebook was black here and black there, with thick pencils and large, crooked Chinese characters and Arabic numerals. He frowned - what a dirty notebook! He also saw that the teacher had marked many ×× in red pen and recorded the scores as "30" "40" and asked, "How do you grade?" Lin Zhennan said, "The best score is one hundred." After saying that, his face turned red, and he didn't speak for a long time. Lin Zhennan was studying at Youhe Elementary School, and his grades were also relatively good. He loved nature, geography, and sports the most. His grades in these subjects were excellent. The subject he found most difficult was arithmetic. As a fourth-grade student, he couldn't recite the multiplication table fluently and had to count in order, one nine, two nine. Seeing this situation, Vega completely understood and decided to help Lin Zhennan. He comforted him, saying, "Soviet children would bite their lips if they got a score of two. But that's no use. From now on, let's study arithmetic together!" He went upstairs and brought his notebook. Lin Zhennan saw that the lines were written so neatly. He also looked at Vega's grade book, which was all fives, with only two threes. Lin Zhennan's face turned red again, and he thought to himself that he must learn from this excellent Soviet student. Vega gave Lin Zhennan a new notebook, sharpened his pencil, told Lin Zhennan to wash his hands, and then started doing exercises.
    The next day after school, Vega came to Lin Zhennan's house as usual. But this time, he didn't come to play, but to study together. From that day on, the two of them did their homework together every day. They always finished their homework before going out to play.
    Vega's friendly help enabled Lin Zhennan's arithmetic to make significant progress soon, and he gradually learned to think independently in his studies. By the time he was in sixth grade, his arithmetic test scores were always four and five (later, Youhe Elementary School also adopted the "five-level grading system"). His notebook was the cleanest in the whole school.
    Vega was so happy when Lin Zhennan got his first five. Vega told his mother, and Vega's mother gave Lin Zhennan a gift.
    Vovo
    Lin Zhennan had many Soviet friends: Baoliang, Yula, Valerian, Natasha, Guoliang, Sasha..., but Vega was the one he respected the most. Vega was not only good at his studies, but also good in character. At school, he respected teachers; at home, he listened to his parents. He was always very polite to others. Chinese and Soviet children on the street liked him and loved to play with him. Lin Zhennan used to be very naughty, often fighting with his classmates, and he didn't walk properly, kicking pebbles in front of people; shaking trees when he saw them. Once, he and Vega went to the stadium to play, and many children were playing ball there. Lin Zhennan wanted to kick it, but the child wouldn't give it to him, so he hit the child. On the way home, Vega said nothing. When they got home, he severely criticized Lin Zhennan, saying, "It is shameful to bully children. I don't want to see my friends behave like this. We should love them like we love our younger siblings." From then on, Lin Zhennan never beat or scolded children again. Lin Zhennan learned from Vega everywhere, and he also became a student of excellent character.
    Summer came again. The summer in Lushunkou is beautiful, and people are attracted to the sea. One Sunday, Lin Zhennan and Vega watched a movie and felt hot, so they went to the cliff to swim in the sea. It was noon, and there were very few people. There were only a few children by the sea. From afar, they saw a three- or four-year-old Soviet child playing on the stone steps. Suddenly, the toy in the child's hand fell into the sea, and he wanted to retrieve it, but he fell into the sea. The two immediately ran forward. Lin Zhennan couldn't wait to take off his clothes and jumped into the sea. At this time, the tide was rising, and white waves rolled in, lapping against the rocks. The child splashed around in the water, crying. Lin Zhennan didn't know how to save people in the water and grabbed the child; when the child saw someone, he tightly hugged his neck with his two small arms, making it difficult for him to move in the water and swallowing several mouthfuls of seawater. Fortunately, Vega stretched out a helping hand on the shore, and the two safely rescued the child ashore. Soon, the child's mother arrived. It turned out that the child's name was Vovo, and his mother lived north of the avenue. She had just gone home to get a towel to prepare for swimming in the sea. Vovo's mother hugged Lin Zhennan, who was soaking wet, and kissed him repeatedly, asking his name and address, and constantly expressing her thanks. In the evening, Vovo's father (a Soviet military officer), mother, and Vovo brought milk, snacks, sweets, and canned food to comfort Lin Zhennan and express their gratitude to Lin Zhennan's parents. Lin Zhennan's heroic rescue of Vovo at sea was commended at the residents' meeting, and the school gave him an award. He also reported his deeds at the Sino-Soviet friendship speech contest.
    The following spring, Vovo's father was about to return to his country. A few days before leaving, he invited Lin Zhennan's family to dinner. The officer gave Lin Zhennan a medal commemorating the Battle of Stalingrad, which was given to him by his closest comrade-in-arms before he died in another battle. The officer said:
  "This is the highest reward of my country for Soviet soldiers. Now I transfer it to the heroic Chinese child. Please keep it well. We thank you and wish you to study hard."
    Lin Zhennan shook the officer's big hand and said, "You should thank Vega, he helped me make progress."
      Two Schoolbags
    In the spring of 1953, the school had already started winter vacation. That day, it was drizzling. Lin Zhennan came back from outside and walked into the courtyard, seeing Vega leaning against the wooden pillar of the stairs in a daze, his eyes red and swollen. What happened? Vega had never cried before. Lin Zhennan quickly went up to comfort him. Vega said with a choked voice, "I'm going back to my country." After hearing this, Lin Zhennan's eyes immediately welled up with tears. He didn't know what to say. Finally, he naively said, "Don't go back, China is so good!" Vega said, "Tonight, you still have to come to my house. As long as we are together for one day, we will study together for one day."
    Two days later, Vega's father and mother invited Lin Zhennan's family upstairs. Adults said goodbye together, and children said goodbye together. Lin Zhennan had discussed with his mother and wanted to give Vega the best gift. He asked Vega, "What do you love the most?" Vega said, "I don't want anything. I've already thought about it, let's exchange schoolbags. In the future, I will go to school with your schoolbag, and you will go to school with my schoolbag, just like we are still studying together." Lin Zhennan thought this was very meaningful and agreed. The two exchanged schoolbags. Vega's was a black leather handbag, and Lin Zhennan's was a yellow cloth bag. They agreed that the things in the schoolbag: textbooks, notebooks, pencils, etc., would be placed as they were.
    As they talked, thinking about the imminent parting, the two children cried again. Finally, Vega said, "Let's not cry, crying is useless. Let's talk about the future. Guoxia, what do you want to do in the future?" Lin Zhennan said without hesitation what he had wanted for a long time:
  "I want to be a people's navy, defending the motherland on the ocean." Vega said loudly, "Excellent!" He stretched out his hand and said, "Congratulations, future naval warrior comrade!" Lin Zhennan asked, "Then what about you?" Vega said, "I want to be an engineer in the future. When I go back to my country, I must study harder. My wish is to come to China again in the future to help China build a communist society." The two children hugged and kissed each other tightly, and the adults nodded and smiled on the side. They saw that the friendship between the two countries of China and the Soviet Union had taken root in the hearts of the children.
    Soon, Vega's father, mother, and Vega returned to their country. Half a month later, Lin Zhennan received a letter from Moscow:
  "...I have safely arrived in the capital of our country - Moscow, and have entered the 79th Middle School to study. I go to school every day with the small schoolbag you gave me. In Moscow, no one uses Chinese schoolbags yet! When my classmates saw my schoolbag, they all asked me where it came from. How proud I was at this time! I told them about our friendship. Now although we are not together, our friendship will last forever. Let us study even harder and engage in communist construction together in the future. Your younger brother, Vega."
    Lin Zhennan and Vega have been separated for more than two years, but the friendship between these two children has grown with the growth of the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. They correspond frequently. Vega's most recent letter was written on November 4, 1954. Lin Zhennan wrote back on the same day he received the letter. He wrote in the letter: "I will always remember what we talked about that night before we parted. Vega, we must strive to realize our ambitions."

　　林镇南和维加
　　本报记者　林钢最好的朋友
    要搬家了，林镇南跟着爸爸、妈妈去看房子。走进院门，有个苏联小朋友在水龙头上接水，个儿不高，戴顶鸭舌帽，穿一身水兵的衣服。见他们来了，有礼貌地问道：“你们好！要搬到这里来住吗？”林镇南从小和苏联小朋友在一起玩，能说一口流利的俄语。他回答说：“是的。”那个苏联孩子说：“好，咱们以后要做朋友了，我早就想交个中国朋友。”林镇南也是这样想的，他走过去，自己介绍说：“我叫林镇南。”苏联孩子说：“我叫维加。”两个人拉过手，抱在一起亲过脸，维加高兴地说：“我们要成为最好的朋友。”
    林镇南和维加的友谊就这样开始了。在旅顺，每一个中国孩子都有苏联小朋友，每一个苏联孩子也有中国小朋友。
    维加家住在楼上，林镇南家住楼下，他们成为邻居以后，就天天在一起劳动，一起玩，一起学习。那年，林镇南十二岁，维加十一岁，都是四年级生。他们在家里都爱帮助妈妈干活，早起，两个人共同扫院子。林镇南劈柴，维加来帮助；维加提水，林镇南来帮助。有一回，林镇南拿了绳子、镰刀，要上山割草，正碰着维加，也要去。林镇南不让他去。维加说：“我们不是已经成了朋友了吗？朋友之间就应该互相帮助。”林镇南没有话说，只好同意了。维加上楼，换了旧衣服，旧裤子，穿一双力士鞋。两人一同上了山，林镇南问道：“你能行吗？”维加说：“开始吧！”一起头，林镇南割的快的多，后来被维加赶上了。
    一个星期天，维加和他的同学来找林镇南玩。林镇南抱歉地说，他不能去，因为他要帮助妈妈搭一个装东西的小木房。维加听了，就说：“我们也不去玩了，让我们帮助你一起来把小木房盖好吧。”其他同学也说：“对，盖好了小木房再一起玩。”孩子们干的多欢呀！你抬泥，他提水；这个锯木头，那个安装。妈妈为这些“泥瓦木工”们准备了一顿面条。从早晨九点到下午三点，一座漂亮的小木房盖成了。
    不久，林镇南和维加就成了最好的朋友了。维加的爸爸是个海军军官，妈妈是苏联中学的教师，他们也都很爱维加的这个诚实而热爱劳动的新朋友。维加的爸爸常常拿着苏联画报，给他们俩讲卫国战争的故事，讲苏联士兵的生活，讲苏联的共产主义建设。他们还给林镇南取了个苏联名字，叫“郭夏”。
    算术笔记本
    维加在苏联学校念书，是个优等生，热情、勇敢、做事有毅力。自从来到中国，妈妈常向他说：
  “要帮助中国小朋友，要向中国小朋友学习。”这些话，他牢牢地记在心里。
    一天，维加来找林镇南玩，正赶上林镇南在做功课。他随手翻开算术笔记本，只见本儿上这儿一块黑，那儿一块黑，老粗的铅笔，歪歪倒倒地写着大个的方块字和阿拉伯字。他皱皱眉头——多么脏的笔记本啊！又看见上面老师用红笔划了许多××，记的分数是“30”“40”，就问：“你们是怎么记分的？”林镇南说：“最好的分数是一百。”说完，脸红了，半天不说话。林镇南在友和小学念书，功课也是比较好的。他最爱自然、地理和体育。这几门功课，成绩都很优良。他最感到困难的功课是算术。四年级的学生，乘法口诀都背不熟，要一九、二九的挨着次序数。维加看这情景，心里完全明白了，他决心帮助林镇南。他安慰说：“我们苏联小朋友，得了二分，会把自己的嘴唇都要咬破的。但是这没有用。今后，让我们一道来研究算术吧！”他上楼，拿来了自己的笔记本。林镇南一看，一行行写的可整齐。他又看维加的记分册，全是五分，只两个三分。林镇南脸又一红，心里想，一定要向这位苏联优等生学习。维加送给林镇南一本新的笔记本，把他的铅笔削尖了，叫林镇南洗洗手，然后开始做习题。
    第二天放学以后，维加照常到林镇南家来了。但是，这次不是来找他玩的，而是找他一起学习的。从那天起，他们两个天天在一起做功课。他们总是做完了功课，再出去玩。
    维加的友谊的帮助，使得林镇南的算术不久就有了显著进步，并且渐渐地学会了在学习上独立思考。到六年级的时候，他的算术考试成绩总是得四分和五分（后来友和小学也采用“五级分制”了）。他的笔记本是全校最整洁的。
    林镇南第一次得五分的时候，维加是多么高兴。维加告诉了妈妈，维加的妈妈给林镇南送了一份礼物。
    沃沃
    林镇南有许多苏联小朋友：鲍良、尤拉、瓦烈良、娜达莎、果良、萨沙……，但是维加是他最敬爱的。维加不仅功课好，品行也好。在学校里，尊敬师长；在家里，听爸爸妈妈的话。他待人接物总是很有礼貌的。街道上的中国孩子和苏联孩子都喜欢他，爱和他玩。林镇南原先可是很顽皮，常爱和同学打仗，走道儿都没有好走的，前面有人，踢把石子；见树，摇几把。有一回，他和维加到体育场玩，许多小孩子在那里玩球，林镇南要踢，小孩不给，他就打了那个孩子。回家的路上，维加什么也没说。回到家，他严厉地批评林镇南道：“欺侮孩子是可耻的行为。我不愿看到我的朋友有这种行为。我们应当像爱护弟弟妹妹一样地爱护他们。”从此以后，林镇南再也没有打骂过孩子。林镇南处处向维加学习，他也成了一个品行优良的学生。
    夏天又来了。旅顺口的夏天是美丽的，人们都被吸引到海上来了。一个星期日，林镇南和维加看完电影，觉着闷热，就到坝崖上洗海澡。正是晌午时分，人很少，海边只有几个小孩。老远他们看见一个三、四岁的苏联小孩在阶石上玩，忽然，小孩手里的玩具掉下了海，他想去捞，翻身掉到海里了。他们俩立刻跑步上前。林镇南等不及脱下衣服就跳下海去。这时正涨潮，白浪滚滚涌来，拍打着岩石。小孩在水面上乱扑腾，哭号着。林镇南不懂得怎样在水中救人，一把抱住小孩；那小孩见人，两只小手臂紧紧地抱住了他的脖颈，使得他在水中很困难动作，吃了好几口海水。幸好维加在岸上伸出了援助的手，两个把小孩安全地救上了岸。不一回，孩子的妈妈赶来了。原来孩子叫沃沃，她妈妈就住在大道北边，刚才是回家取毛巾准备洗海澡的。沃沃的妈妈抱住混身水淋水湿的林镇南直亲吻，问他的名字、住址，还不住地说着感谢的话。晚上，沃沃的爸爸（一位苏军军官）、妈妈和沃沃，带了牛奶、点心、糖果、罐头来慰问林镇南，向林镇南的爸爸妈妈表示感谢。林镇南海上抢救沃沃的事迹，在居民大会上得到了表扬，学校给了他奖励，他还在中苏友谊演讲比赛大会上报告了自己的事迹。
    第二年春天，沃沃的爸爸要回国了。临走前几天，他把林镇南全家请了去吃饭。军官送给林镇南
  一枚斯大林格勒保卫战的纪念章，这是他最亲密的战友在另一次战役中阵亡前送给他的。军官说：
  “这是我的祖国对于苏维埃战士的最高奖赏。现在我把它转送给英雄的中国孩子。请你好好保存它。我们感谢你，愿你好好学习。”
    林镇南握住军官的大手说：“您要感谢维加，是他帮助我进步的。”
      两个书包
    一九五三年春天，学校已经放寒假了。那天，下着蒙蒙细雨。林镇南从外面回来，走进院子，看见维加倚着楼梯的木柱在呆想，两眼红肿。发生了什么事情呢？维加从来没有哭过。林镇南连忙走上去安慰他。维加哽咽着嗓子说：“我要回国了。”听完这句话，林镇南的两眼也立刻涌出热泪来。他不知道说什么好，最后，天真地说：“不要回去吧，我们中国多么好！”维加说：“今晚上，你还是要到我家来。只要我俩有一天在一起，就要共同学习一天。”
    过了两天，维加的爸爸和妈妈，把林镇南全家请上了楼。大人在一起道别，小孩在一起道别。林镇南和妈妈商量好了，要送一样最好的礼物给维加。他问维加：“你最心爱的是什么东西？”维加说：“什么也不要。我早想好了，我们来交换书包。以后，我背着你的书包上学，你背着我的书包上学，就像我们还在一起学习。”林镇南听了，觉得这很有意义，就同意了。两人交换了书包。维加的是一个黑色的手提皮包，林镇南的是黄色的布包。他们讲好：书包里的东西：教科书、笔记本、铅笔等，照原样放着。
    谈着谈着，想到马上就要分别，两个孩子又哭起来了。最后，还是维加说：“咱们不哭吧，哭也没有用。咱们来谈谈将来。郭夏，你将来想做什么？”林镇南毫不迟疑地说出了老早就有的志愿：
  “我想做个人民海军，在海洋上保卫祖国。”维加大声道：“好极了！”他把手伸过来说：“祝贺你，未来的海军战士同志！”林镇南问：“那么你呢？”维加说：“我将来要做一个工程师。我回国去，一定要更努力学习。我的志愿是，将来再到中国来，帮助中国建设共产主义社会。”两个小朋友紧紧地拥抱和亲吻起来，大人们在一旁点头微笑，他们看到，中苏两国的友谊在孩子们的心里扎下了根。
    不久，维加的爸爸、妈妈和维加回国去了。过了半月，林镇南就收到了一封从莫斯科寄来的信：
  “……我已经平安地到达了我们祖国的首都——莫斯科，并已进入第七十九号中学学习。我每天背着你送给我的小书包上学。在莫斯科，还没有人用中国书包呢！我的同学们看了我的书包，都问我是那儿来的。这时我多么骄傲呀！我把咱们的友谊讲给他们听了。现在我们俩虽然不在一起，但我们的友谊却永远存在。让我们更加倍努力学习吧，将来一道去从事共产主义建设。你的弟弟维加。”
    林镇南和维加分别二年多了，这两个小朋友的友谊却随着中苏两国人民之间友谊的增长而增长。他们经常通讯。维加的最近一封来信是一九五四年十一月四日写的。林镇南在接到信的当天就写去了回信。他在信上写道：“我永远记着临别那天晚上我们讲过的话，维加，我们一定要努力实现自己的志愿。”
