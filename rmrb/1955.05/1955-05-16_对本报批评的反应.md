　　Reactions to the Newspaper's Criticism
　　On April 17th, this newspaper published an article entitled "Can Double-Wheel Double-Share Ploughs Be Manufactured This Way?", criticizing the Xiangyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Hubei Province for blindly deciding to have local state-owned Xin Guang, Ebei, and other iron factories manufacture new-style animal-powered farm implements, without considering these factories' equipment capabilities and technical conditions. Not only did they fail to stop the shoddy manufacturing of the double-wheel double-share ploughs they trial-produced, but they also insisted on continuing even after the Hubei Provincial Department of Industry discovered the problem and ordered a halt to production. Now, the Xiangyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office has sent a letter of self-criticism, acknowledging that this criticism is entirely correct and proposing several specific measures: First, all the sold double-wheel double-share ploughs will be recalled by the factories, and the money will be fully refunded to the buyers at the selling price, with apologies made to the farmers who purchased the double-wheel double-share ploughs. Second, for other small farm implements of substandard quality that have been sold, users' opinions will be solicited, and repairs and replacements will be actively carried out. Third, in the future, when manufacturing new-style farm implements, the unified manufacturing drawings, technical conditions, and material specifications stipulated by the First Ministry of Machine Building will be strictly observed. Fourth, based on the existing conditions of each factory, and based on seasonal and regional characteristics, more small farm implements that are popular with the local masses and are inexpensive and of good quality, and improved old-style farm implements, will be produced.

　　On March 14th, this newspaper published an article entitled "Listen to the Workers' Opinions," and on March 28th, this newspaper's editorial "Oppose Waste in Construction," criticized the excessive construction costs and rents for newly built housing at the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory last year. The Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a letter stating that they believe this criticism is correct. They have convened a Party committee meeting for discussion, examined the shortcomings in handling this issue during the construction and after the completion of the houses, decided to reduce rent charges, and suggested that the higher authorities lower the design standards for the new dormitories approved for construction this year, in order to avoid repeating last year's mistakes.

　　对本报批评的反应
    四月十七日本报发表了“双轮双铧犁可以这样制造吗”一文，批评湖北省襄阳专署盲目决定地方国营新光、鄂北等铁工厂制造新式畜力农具，不考虑这些工厂的设备能力和技术条件，对他们试制的双轮双铧犁的粗制滥造现象不但不加制止，而且当湖北省工业厅发现后命令停止制造时，还坚持不改。现在，襄阳专署已来信检讨，认为这一批评是完全正确的，并提出了几项具体措施：一、对已售出的双轮双铧犁，由工厂全部收回，按售价把钱全部退还给买主，并向购买了双轮双铧犁的农民作检讨。二、已出售的其他质量不合规格的小型农具，征求用户意见，主动进行修理、配换。三、今后制造新式农具时，严格遵守第一机械工业部统一规定的制造图纸、技术条件和材料规格。四、根据各工厂现有条件，根据季节和地区性的特点，多生产当地群众欢迎的价廉质好的小型农具和改良旧式农具。

    三月十四日本报发表的“听听工人的意见”一文和二十八日本报社论“反对建筑中的浪费现象”中，批评了齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造工厂去年新建住宅造价和房租太高的问题。中共齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造工厂委员会来信说，他们认为这一批评是正确的，他们已召开了党委会进行讨论，检查了在房子建筑时和落成以后对这一问题处理上的缺点；决定要降低房租收费；并且建议上级降低已批准在今年修建的新宿舍的设计标准，以免重复去年的错误。
