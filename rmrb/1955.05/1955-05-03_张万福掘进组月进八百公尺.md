　  Zhang Wanfu's Tunneling Team Advances Eight Hundred Meters in a Month
    On the day of celebrating the "May Day" International Labor Day, the Datong Coal Mine spread an encouraging news: The fast tunneling team led by Zhang Wanfu, a labor model of Shanxi Province's industry, created a record of advancing eight hundred and thirteen point four meters in April. The workers of Zhang Wanfu's fast tunneling team, in order to welcome their own festival, proposed to guarantee to tunnel one hundred and fifty meters more than the plan assigned by the state in April. In the process of production, they adjusted the labor organization and improved the alleyway cart pushing method to ensure the normal cycle of tunneling work. By the end of April, they had tunneled two hundred and fifty-three meters more than the task assigned by the state. This month, due to the opening of new coal seams and the impact of power plant outages, they actually only used more than twenty-six days to overfulfill the plan.

　  张万福掘进组月进八百公尺
    大同煤矿在庆祝“五一”国际劳动节这天，传出了一个令人振奋的消息：山西省工业劳动模范张万福领导的快速掘进组，四月份创造了月进八百十三点四公尺的最高纪录。张万福快速掘进组的工人们，为了迎接自己的节日，曾提出要在四月份比国家交给的计划多掘进一百五十公尺的保证。在生产过程中，他们调整了劳力组织，改进了巷道推车工作法，保证了掘进工作的正常循环。到四月底，他们比国家交给的任务多掘进了二百五十三公尺。这个月由于开采新煤层和受到电厂停电的影响，他们实际上只用了二十六天多的时间就超额完成了计划。
