　　Striving for a New Upsurge in Industry on the Basis of High Industrialization
　　——Notes from the All-Union Conference of Industrial Workers
　　By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Lǐ Hé
    The All-Union Conference of Industrial Workers was held in the Kremlin for three days, from May 16th to 18th. Attending the conference were 2,500 leading administrative personnel, engineers, technicians, designers, advanced workers, and scientists from key factories and mines in various sectors of Soviet industry. Together with the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government, they discussed a major national issue: further developing socialist industry based on the widespread adoption of scientific, technological, and advanced experiences. The conference unanimously adopted a letter to all workers and staff of industrial enterprises across the country, calling for a broad socialist emulation campaign to strive for overfulfilling the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan and the 1955 national plan. Undoubtedly, this conference marks a milestone in the journey of the highly industrialized Soviet industry, especially heavy industry, towards new heights.

    The conference extensively discussed industrial issues with a high degree of criticism and self-criticism. This does not mean that the Soviet Union has encountered significant difficulties in industry or is experiencing a downturn. In fact, Soviet industry has been growing year after year. The tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan are being overfulfilled. Heavy industry, as the foundation of the socialist economy, is developing particularly rapidly. The current output of heavy industry is more than three times that of 1940. Therefore, this extensive discussion of industrial issues only further demonstrates that the Soviet people, under the guidance of the Soviet Communist Party, never rest on their existing achievements and always strive for greater progress. As Comrade Khrushchev said, "We hope for the best, and there is no end to the best. Therefore, we will constantly raise and discuss various issues concerning the development of the national economy."

    From the speeches of the conference participants, it can be seen that various sectors of Soviet industry are now adopting many new scientific and technological achievements and advanced experiences. Here are a few examples:

    In the machine-building industry, the forger Oleinikov from the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant recounted at the conference that the forging workshop of the plant had summarized a series of rational operations, increasing labor productivity by 50% to 60%. Flexible operating machines were set up next to the steam hammers, so that a team of four people now does more than twice the work previously done by eight people. The Minister of the Soviet Machine Tool and Tool Industry, Kostousov, told the conference that the ministry has set a plan to replace old-fashioned machine tools with new universal lathes and special lathes, and new forging presses.

    In the iron and steel industry, the director of the open-hearth furnace workshop of the Zaporozhye Steel Plant, Leskov, said at the conference that the current steel production in the open-hearth furnace workshop is three times that of the pre-war period. This is not due to the construction of new workshops, but due to the adoption of new technologies, primarily the use of oxygen to intensify the steelmaking process. The Minister of the Soviet Iron and Steel Industry, Sheremetev, told the conference that the utilization coefficient of the effective volume of Soviet blast furnaces improved by 32% in 1954 compared to 1940, and the steel output per square meter of open-hearth furnace bottom increased by 60%.

    In the coal mining industry, the manager of the Kuzbass Coal Mine United Enterprise, Kozhevin, said at the conference that further development of hydraulic coal mining and open-pit coal mining methods in Kuzbass is an important way to improve labor productivity. The Minister of the Soviet Coal Mining Industry, Zademidko, told the conference that coal miners have greatly increased coal production after the war. However, the growth of labor productivity has not kept up with the level of technical equipment in coal mines.

    In the petroleum industry, the Minister of the Soviet Petroleum Industry, Baibakov, said at the conference that the average annual growth of oil production in the Fifth Five-Year Plan is five times that of the pre-war five years. Whether in Bashkiria or the Tatar Autonomous Republic, the daily oil production in 1955 has caught up with Baku. Large oil fields are also being exploited in other regions. Drilling work has progressed. The method of injecting water into the periphery of oil fields has great advantages.

    The speakers all engaged in serious criticism and self-criticism, pointing out that many advanced working experiences and methods have not been researched and promoted by relevant departments and enterprises.

    The widespread adoption of new scientific and technological achievements into production requires a closer integration of science and production. This demand was reflected in the speeches of the conference participants. The Academic Secretary of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Topchiev, said that science cannot survive without relying on practice. The plans for scientific research work should be adjusted. Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Yemelyanov, spoke about the use of atomic energy in Soviet industry, saying that radioactive isotopes are used in inspection and automated production, and are used in the accurate research of chemical, metallurgical, and analytical work. At the construction sites of the Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, and Gorky hydroelectric power stations, instruments with radioactive cobalt are used to inspect the work of dredgers, increasing the efficiency of the machines by 20%. He suggested that radioactive isotopes can and should be widely used in drilling oil wells, extracting oil, and studying the wear and tear of machine parts, etc. The director of the Steel Plant Design Institute, Antoniev, told the conference about his invention: evaporative cooling of open-hearth furnaces. This is the use of boiling water instead of cold water to cool open-hearth furnaces. For more than two years, dozens of open-hearth furnaces have adopted this evaporative cooling method. Last year alone, it saved the state 25 million rubles. The Ministry of the Iron and Steel Industry has decided that all open-hearth furnaces in steel plants should adopt this cooling method. The chief engineer of a machine-building factory, Grinev, criticized many scientific research institutions for being far away from large factories and essentially detached from production. He advocated expanding the laboratories of factories in order to directly solve complex problems on the spot.

    In order to rapidly and widely adopt advanced experiences, the conference pointed out that socialist emulation should be better organized, the initiatives of production innovators should be more vigorously supported, and the inventions and rationalization proposals of workers and staff should be adopted more quickly. Comrade Bulganin emphasized these points in his speech. He pointed out that there are many advanced enterprises in Soviet industry, such as the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine, the Tuimazy Oilfield, the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant, and thousands of production innovators. He said, "The main task of the current socialist emulation is to widely promote the experiences and achievements of advanced workers in production." He mentioned that the slow review of inventions and rationalization proposals would make many inventions and rationalization proposals obsolete and lose their significance for application to production. The Vice Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, Solovyov, spoke at the conference about strengthening the leadership of socialist emulation. He criticized certain trade union organizations for generally weakening attention to emulation issues in the name of fighting formalism, and criticized many enterprises for abolishing the individual socialist emulation among workers, but this is the most extensive and effective form of competition. He said that the tasks put forward by the Party and the government to industrial workers require the trade unions to further expand the competition to fulfill production quotas and promote the experiences of innovators.

    When discussing the struggle for technological progress, the conference paid special attention to the issue of conservation, which includes several aspects: 1. Better utilization of existing equipment and existing sites; 2. Streamlining the administrative management institutions in industry; 3. Saving metal and reducing waste; 4. Strengthening the specialization of production and the collaboration between various departments and enterprises. The conference criticized the erroneous view of some economic workers who thought that only expanding new workshops could increase production, paying little attention to better using existing production capacity and little attention to renovating old equipment. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his speech that by improving production organization, industrial products can be greatly increased with existing production sites and equipment. Comrade Bulganin criticized in his speech the phenomenon that the management institutions of medium-sized and small enterprises are the same as those of large factories. He pointed out that it is necessary to improve the management institutions of factories, eliminate unnecessary links, and merge small workshops and departments. Comrade Khrushchev cited many examples at the conference, criticizing the phenomenon of irrational use of metal. He said that if metal is used better, the production of metal products can be increased by half to one time. He called for attention to conservation in construction and other aspects: using reinforced concrete structures instead of metal structures in construction; widely adopting pressure molding and smelting equipment and precision casting methods and other technologies in order to reduce chips to a minimum; expanding the variety of rolled metals to save much metal.

    The specialization of production and the coordinated cooperation of various departments and enterprises are measures to greatly increase labor productivity and save manpower and materials. This is the direction of development that Soviet industry has always pursued. This conference focused on discussing the issue of further realizing this direction. The conference criticized the phenomenon that one industrial department or one factory produces everything and lacks sufficient cooperation with each other. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that the current task is to go along the line of strengthening the specialization of production and widespread coordinated cooperation. Coordinated cooperation should be implemented not only within one ministry, but also between various ministries. Establishing specialized factories can mass-produce high-quality and cheaper industrial products. (May 20)

　　在高度工业化的基础上争取工业的新高涨
　　——记全苏工业工作人员会议
　　本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    全苏工业工作人员会议从五月十六日到十八日在克里姆林宫举行了三天。参加会议的有苏联工业各个部门的重要厂矿的行政领导人、工程师、技师设计师、先进工人和科学工作者二千五百人。他们同苏联共产党和政府的领导者们一起讨论了国家大事——在广泛采用科学、技术、先进经验的成就的基础上，进一步发展社会主义工业。会议一致通过了告全国一切工业企业职工书，号召广泛地展开社会主义竞赛，争取超额完成第五个五年计划的任务和一九五五年国家计划。无疑的，这次会议是高度工业化的苏联工业，首先是重工业，走向新高峰的里程碑。
    会议以高度的批评和自我批评的精神广泛地讨论了工业问题。这并不是说苏联在工业中有了什么巨大的困难，有了什么不景气的情况。事实上苏联工业年年都在增长。第五个五年计划的任务正在超额地完成。作为社会主义经济基础的重工业发展得特别快。重工业现在的产量等于一九四○年的三倍以上。因此这次对工业问题的广泛讨论，只是又一次表明，苏联人民在苏联共产党的教导下，向来不自满于已经有的成绩，而总是努力争取更大的成绩。正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说的：“我们希望好，而好是无尽头的。因此我们将经常提出和讨论这种或者那种关于发展国民经济的问题。”
    从会议的参加者的发言中可以看到，现在苏联工业各部门采用着许多科学和技术的新成就和先进经验。下面是几个例子：
    在机器制造业方面。乌拉尔重型机器制造厂的锻工奥黎尼科夫在会上叙述：这个工厂的锻工车间概括了一系列合理的操作，把劳动生产率提高百分之五十到六十，在汽锤旁边设置了灵活的操作机，使现在四个人一组做了以前八个人的两倍多的工作。苏联母机制造和工具工业部部长科斯托乌索夫告诉会议：工业部已定好计划，将以新式的万能车床和专用车床、新式的锻压机代替旧式的。
    在钢铁工业方面。札波罗什钢铁厂平炉车间主任列斯科夫在会上说：平炉车间现在产钢量三倍于战前。这不是由于建设新的车间，而是由于采用新的技术，首先是采用氧气来强化炼钢过程。苏联钢铁工业部部长谢列梅捷夫告诉会议：苏联高炉有效容积的利用系数在一九五四年比一九四○年改进了百分之三十二，平炉炉底每一平方公尺出钢量增加了百分之六十。
    在采煤工业方面。“库兹巴斯”煤矿联合企业经理科热文在会上说：在库兹巴斯进一步发展用水力采煤和露天采煤方法，是提高劳动生产率的重要的办法。苏联采煤工业部部长扎杰米德科告诉会议：采煤工人在战后大大提高了采煤量。但是劳动生产率的增长没有赶上煤矿技术装备的水平。
    在石油工业方面。苏联石油工业部部长巴伊巴科夫在会上说：在第五个五年计划中每年平均采油量的增长为战前五年的五倍。不论在巴什基里亚还是鞑靼自治共和国，在一九五五年每昼夜的采油量都赶上了巴库。在别的地区也开采着大油田。钻井工作进步了。在油田外围注水的方法具有极大优点。
    发言的人都进行了严肃的批评和自我批评，指出许多先进的工作经验和方法没有得到有关部门和企业的研究和推广。
    广泛地采用科学和技术的新成就到生产中去，这要求科学和生产更密切的结合。在参加会议者的发言中反映了这样的要求。苏联科学院学术秘书长托普齐也夫说：科学要是在实践中没有依靠就不能生活。应当调整科学研究工作的计划。苏联科学院通讯院士叶麦利雅诺夫谈到苏联在工业中利用原子能的情形说：放射性的同位素被用在检查和自动化生产上，被用在化学、冶金和分析工作的精确研究上。在古比雪夫、斯大林格勒和高尔基水电站工地上，用带放射性的钴的仪器来检查吸泥机的工作，使机器的效率提高百分之二十。他建议，放射性的同位素可以也应当广泛地利用到钻油井、采石油以及研究机器零件的磨损情形等等方面去。钢铁工厂设计学院的部主任安东也夫向会议谈了他的发明——平炉蒸发式的冷却。这就是不用冷水而用开水来冷却平炉。两年多来几十个平炉采用了这个蒸发式的冷却方法。去年一年就为国家节约了二千五百万卢布。钢铁工业部决定了要所有钢铁工厂的平炉都采用这个冷却方法。机器制造厂的总技师格里涅夫批评了许多科学研究机关远离大工厂，实质上脱离生产。他主张扩大工厂的实验室，以便就地直接解决复杂的问题。
    为着迅速地广泛地采用先进经验，会议指出，应当更好地组织社会主义竞赛，更有力地支持生产革新者的创举，更迅速地采纳职工的发明和合理化建议。布尔加宁同志的演说中着重指出了这几点。他指出在苏联工业中有许多先进的企业如像马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂、图伊玛兹油矿、乌拉尔重型机器制造厂等等和数以千计的生产革新者。他说：“目前社会主义竞赛的主要任务是广泛地推广生产中的先进工作者的经验和成就。”他提到了审查发明和合理化建议的缓慢，会使许多发明和合理化建议变成陈旧而失去运用到生产中去的意义。全苏工会中央理事会副主席索洛维也夫在会上谈了加强社会主义竞赛的领导问题。他批评了某些工会组织在同形式主义作斗争的名义下一般削弱了对竞赛问题的注意，批评了许多企业收起了工人之间的个人的社会主义竞赛，但这是最广泛最有效的竞赛方式。他说：党和政府向工业工作人员提出的任务，要求工会进一步展开完成生产定额和推广革新者经验的竞赛。
    会议在讨论为技术的进步而斗争的问题的时候，特别注意节约问题，这包括几个方面：一、更好地利用现有设备和现有场所；二、精简工业中的行政管理机构；三、节约金属和减少废品；四、加强生产的专业化和各部门各企业的协作。会议批评了某些经济工作者的错误观点，他们以为只有扩建新的车间才可以增加产量，很少注意更好地使用现有的生产能力，很少注意改装陈旧的设备。赫鲁晓夫同志在他的演说中指出了：在改善生产组织时可以用现有的生产场地和设备，大大增产工业品。布尔加宁同志在他的演说中批评了中型和不大的企业的管理机构与大型工厂的管理机构一样的现象。他指出了要改善工厂的管理机构，取消不必要的环节，合并小车间和部门。赫鲁晓夫同志在会上举了许多例子，批评了不合理地使用金属的现象。他说：要是更好使用金属，能够增产半倍到一倍的金属制品。他号召在建设和其他方面注意节约：在建筑上用钢筋混凝土结构代替金属结构；广泛采用压模和冶炼设备和精密铸造法以及其他技术，以便减少切屑到最低限度；扩增轧制的金属的品种，以节约许多金属。
    生产的专业化和各部门各企业的协同合作，是大规模地提高劳动生产率和节约人力物力的措施。这是苏联工业一直施行的发展方向。这次会议着重讨论了进一步实现这个方向的问题。会议批评了那种在一个工业部门内，在一个工厂内无所不生产和彼此配合不够的现象。赫鲁晓夫同志指出：目前的任务是要沿着加强生产专业分工和广泛协同合作的路线走去。协同合作不仅应该在一个部内，而且应该在各部之间实行。建立专业化工厂，就可以大批生产优等的更便宜的工业品。　（五月二十日）
