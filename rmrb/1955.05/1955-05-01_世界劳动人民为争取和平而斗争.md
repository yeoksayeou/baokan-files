　　World's Laboring People Fight for Peace
　　Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions

    The main facts of the world political situation are: a certain degree of aggravation of international tensions in recent times and a continued deterioration of the living and working conditions of the laboring people in capitalist countries and their dependencies.

    Obviously, the direct cause of all these facts is the policy pursued by the American ruling groups and the governments of various capitalist countries bought by them in order to consolidate their positions of strength in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

    In pursuit of maximum profits and to postpone the arrival of a serious crisis, imperialism has fully invested in preparations for war and atomic war, as evidenced by the recent resolutions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    American imperialism continues to implement the strategies formulated at the Manila Conference and the Bangkok Conference, supporting and encouraging Chiang Kai-shek's provocations against the People's Republic of China, and shamefully interfering in the internal affairs of the Chinese people. They arbitrarily violate the resolutions of the Geneva Conference, militarily infiltrate South Vietnam, and prepare new provocations to obstruct free elections, because they foresee that the election results will be extremely unfavorable to them.

    American imperialism and its Western friends, using various conspiracies and pressures, as well as incredible bribery among bourgeois elements, have led to the approval of the Paris Agreements. The Paris Agreements give weapons of mass destruction to Hitler's old generals, thereby facilitating their provocations and the launching of a third world war.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions has constantly pointed out that the imperialist powers have further intensified war preparations, accompanied by the deterioration of the situation of the masses of people in capitalist countries, colonies, and semi-colonies. The policy of accelerated arms race pursued by Western governments means for the laboring people of Africa, the Americas, and other Asian and European countries still under systems of exploitation of man by man, deepening poverty, increased unemployment, rising living costs, reduced purchasing power, and increased labor exploitation, and means new attacks on their trade union and democratic rights. For the oppressed peoples, it means increased pressure.

    However, despite the recent situation and the dangers facing the people of all countries are so serious, we should see in this past period, the great victories achieved by the peace camp led by the powerful Soviet Union and the great People's Republic of China, these victories have aroused the fear of the political servants of the monopoly capitalists. We should see that the imperialist warmongers and instigators have become increasingly isolated, and the gap between them and the masses of the people in their own and other countries has widened. The world's people and laboring people do not need war or a war race. They demand a decent life and demand to live better in a peaceful world. In socialist countries, they have expressed this demand unanimously and powerfully. In countries where monopoly capital occupies a dominant position, they have expressed this in various ways and with perseverance, based on their own experience and their political maturity.

    In Cuba or Costa Rica, in Uruguay and Brazil, in Northern Rhodesia, in Japan, India, Kenya, in Italy, France and West Germany, a recent feature is the new development of the people's united struggle, and these struggles have often achieved victories. In all these countries, the laboring people have known how to combine the struggle for wages and the defense of their rights and freedoms; they have participated in increasing numbers in the various international signature campaigns initiated by the World Peace Council. In Asia and Europe, the two most sensitive centers of the international situation, the struggle for economic demands and the struggle for peace are even more powerfully combined.

    The Asian people, who suffered the pain of the first explosions of atomic warfare, inspired by the shining example and peaceful stance of the Chinese people, are waging fierce and unified struggles to win their national independence and defend peace. Under the attention of the peoples and workers of all Asian countries, the Asian-African Conference, representing more than half of the world's population, was held in Bandung this April, and the special international significance of this conference has been expressed in various public opinions.

    When Chiang Kai-shek and the United States launched provocations against China, the workers of Australia, Ceylon, New Zealand, Indonesia, and India rose up to oppose foreign interference in China. In all Asian countries, the international movement against the atomic threat is developing at an exemplary speed.

    The continuous activities of the laboring people for peace are a great encouragement to the international trade union movement.

    The blows suffered by American imperialism's "policy of strength" and policy of dominating other peoples in Asia are a valuable assistance to the peoples and workers of European countries. The peoples and workers of European countries, illuminated by the wise policies of the Soviet Union, are waging the same battles as their Asian brothers. The solidarity of all peoples in the struggle against the scourge of war, and the solidarity of the peoples of Europe and Asia in the struggle, have never been as clear as they are now.

    The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor sent a letter to the French laboring people, expressing opposition to the rearmament of German revanchists; the Japanese metalworkers also sent letters to their German comrades expressing their desire to strengthen solidarity. In response to this, the Welsh miners in Britain expressed their firm opposition to their national government's decision to help Chiang Kai-shek in any form!

    The laboring people and trade unions of European countries have deeply recognized the significance of this close international solidarity and are taking unyielding action against the re-emergence of German militarism. They have enthusiastically participated in the signature campaign on the appeal of the World Peace Council. They successfully held the March 10th Solidarity Day to support the German laboring people, carried out numerous demonstrations, and a large number of delegations were sent between European countries and Germany, especially between France and West Germany. In mid-March, the laboring people of France proposed convening a European workers' conference to oppose the revival of German militarism, to oppose the threat of atomic war, and to strive for friendly and peaceful coexistence among the peoples of all countries. This proposal received a warm welcome in France and other European countries.

    From April 22nd to 24th, the European National Laboring People and Trade Union Representative Conference, with representatives from twenty-five countries including France and the German Democratic Republic, was held in Leipzig.

    The Leipzig Conference was a gathering of European workers against the rearmament of Germany and against atomic war, and it will be a valuable support to the struggle of all peoples for peace. It marks an important stage in the path of unity and solidarity of workers and trade unions in European countries.

    After such a brief analysis of the international situation, some lessons and noteworthy points can be drawn for our trade union movement. It is clear that the laboring people have increasingly understood that when peace is endangered in Europe or Asia, the whole world will be threatened; they increasingly understand that they belong to the same team defending world peace.

    On the other hand, the laboring people have increasingly understood that when the governments of capitalist countries are implementing war policies internationally, they are affected within their own countries, their difficulties will increase; they will become the target of attacks by reactionary forces, and their rights and freedoms will be trampled upon. This proves that the policy stipulated by the World Federation of Trade Unions is correct, that is, the workers' actions are not only to resolutely demand the satisfaction of their various economic demands, but also to resolutely oppose the policy of war.

    A characteristic of the international struggle of workers in the current stage is that they have realized that, as a decisive, progressive, and firm peace-loving class, their strength inspires and organizes the people's struggle against the heinous plans of anti-atomic war. This characteristic is also manifested in the various initiatives for unity and solidarity put forward by the working class and their various organizations.

    The current stage of the laboring people's struggle for peace shows that there is a huge potential force among the working class all over the world, in various construction sites, in various factories, and these huge potential forces should inspire our confidence and our activities to defeat our enemies.

    Therefore, our task is to take action, to go deep into the work sites, to maintain constant contact with the masses of the laboring people, to support them with our organization and our experience; everywhere we must help them consolidate unified action and strengthen the international solidarity of trade unions. We should develop the fraternal ties between workers in all countries in various ways, which is a prerequisite for friendly ties between the peoples of all countries. We should promote the ever-increasing friendly exchanges between Chinese workers and their Asian brothers, and also promote this friendly relationship developing among European worker brothers.

    The organizations affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions should play a decisive role in the great mobilization among workers for the life and future of the peoples of all countries.

    This is why our enemies, the enemies of working-class unity, are actively carrying out various activities everywhere (especially in Europe and Asia) to slander the World Federation of Trade Unions, to split the laboring people, and to bring them into the orbit of the policies planned by the U.S. State Department. The reactionary heads of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations force the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions to accept American law, directly interfere in the affairs of European trade unions, recite Washington's instructions to the laboring people of Europe, and ask them to help rearm the executioners of the European and German people.

    They are carrying out intense activities in India, especially in Japan, engaging in splitting the laboring people and their organizations, trying to prevent the great tide of international solidarity and unity, because the struggle of the peoples of all Asian countries for peace supports this solidarity and unity movement. But they cannot achieve their goals, they cannot stop the development of friendly ties between the laboring people of capitalist countries and their brothers in countries that have freed themselves from capitalist shackles. They also cannot stop the success of the May Day of 1955 - the festival of international solidarity and the struggle for peace. As for the World Federation of Trade Unions, it is pleased with this irresistible movement towards solidarity and peace. The World Federation of Trade Unions has been and will make every effort to promote the development of this movement. This year is the tenth anniversary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and it pays tribute to the strong and creative will of the laboring people of all countries to unite for peace.

    世界劳动人民为争取和平而斗争
　　世界工会联合会总书记　路易·赛扬
    世界政治形势的主要事实是：国际紧张局势在最近有某种程度的加剧和各资本主义国家及附属国劳动人民的生活和劳动条件继续恶化。
    很显然，这一切事实的直接原因就是：美国统治集团和为它们所收买的各资本主义国家政府为了巩固他们在亚洲、欧洲和中东的实力地位而执行的政策。
    为了追求最大的利润，为了延缓严重危机的到来，帝国主义全力投入了战争和原子战争的准备，北大西洋公约组织最近的决议就证明了这一点。
    美帝国主义继续执行着马尼拉会议和曼谷会议上所制定的策略，支持并鼓励蒋介石对中华人民共和国所进行的挑衅，并可耻地干涉中国人民的内政。他们专横地违反日内瓦会议的各项决议，在军事上渗入南越并准备新的挑衅，以阻挠举行自由选举，因为他们预料到选举的结果对他们将是极端不利的。
    美帝国主义和它的西方朋友们，使用了各种阴谋和压力以及在资产阶级分子中所施行的令人难以置信的贿赂手段，致使巴黎协定获得了批准。巴黎协定把大规模毁灭性的武器给予希特勒的旧将领，从而便于他们进行挑衅和发动第三次世界大战。
    世界工联不断指出，帝国主义列强已使战争准备更进一步加甚，伴随着这一战争准备而来的是各资本主义国家、殖民地和半殖民地国家人民群众处境的恶化。西方各国政府所奉行的加速军备竞赛的政策，对于还处于人剥削人制度下的非洲、美洲以及其他亚洲和欧洲各国劳动人民讲来，就意味着贫困加深，失业增涨，生活费用上涨，购买力降低和劳动剥削加甚，意味着他们的工会和民主权利遭到新的进攻。对于各被压迫人民这意味着压力加重。
    然而，尽管最近的形势和各国人民所面临的危险是如此严重，我们应当看到在过去这一时期中，由强大的苏联和伟大的中华人民共和国所领导的和平阵营所已取得的各项伟大的胜利，这些胜利已引起了各垄断资本家们的政治仆从们的恐惧。我们应当看到帝国主义战争贩子和挑拨者已日益遭到孤立，他们和他们本国以及其他国家的人民群众之间的鸿沟也已加深。世界人民群众和劳动人民不需要战争也不需要战争竞赛。他们要求有一个像样的生活，并且要求在和平的世界中生活得更好。在社会主义国家中，他们已一致而又有力地表示了这种要求。在垄断资本占据统治地位的国家中，他们凭着自己所具有的经验和他们在政治上的成熟程度，而以各种不同的方式和毅力表现了这一点。
    在古巴或哥斯达黎加，在乌拉圭和巴西，在北罗德西亚，在日本、印度、怯尼亚，在意大利、法国和西德，近来的一个特点就是人民的统一的斗争有了新的发展，这些斗争往往都取得了胜利。在所有这些国家中，劳动人民已知道把争取工资和保卫他们权利和自由的斗争结合起来；他们日益众多地参加了世界和平理事会所发起的各种国际签名运动。在亚洲和欧洲，这两个国际形势中最敏感的中心地区，争取经济要求的斗争和争取和平的斗争更是有力地结合了起来。
    亚洲人民群众遭受了原子战争的第一批爆炸的痛苦，他们在中国人民的光辉榜样和和平立场的鼓舞下，正进行着剧烈的和统一的斗争，以争取他们民族的独立并保卫和平。在亚洲各族人民和工人们的关注之下，今年四月在万隆举行了代表着全世界半数以上人口的亚非会议，这一会议所具有的特殊的国际意义已在各种公众舆论中表达出来了。
    当蒋介石和美国对中国发动挑衅时，澳大利亚、锡兰、新西兰、印度尼西亚和印度的工人们都起来反对外国对中国的干涉。在所有各亚洲国家中，反对原子威胁的国际运动正以值得仿效的速度发展着。
    劳动人民为争取和平而不断进行的活动对国际工会运动是一种莫大的鼓舞。
    美帝国主义的“实力政策”和统治别国人民的政策在亚洲所遭受到的打击，对欧洲各国人民和工人们是一种宝贵的援助。欧洲各国人民和工人们在苏联的明智的政策的照耀下，正进行着和亚洲兄弟们相同的战斗。各族人民在反对战争灾祸的斗争中的团结以及欧亚各国人民在斗争中的团结，从未表现得有如现在这样清楚。
    越南总工会曾致函法国劳动人民，表示反对重新武装德国复仇主义者；日本的五金工人们也曾给德国的同志们表示要加强团结的信件。而与此相呼应的，则有英国威尔斯的矿工们表示坚决反对他们国家政府以任何形式帮助蒋介石的决议！
    欧洲各国劳动人民和各工会已深深地认识到这种紧密的国际团结的意义，正以不屈不挠的行动反对重新复活德国军国主义。他们热烈地参加了在世界和平理事会号召书上的签名运动。他们成功地举行了三月十日支援德国劳动人民团结日，进行了多次的示威运动，欧洲各国和德国，特别是法国和西德之间相互派遣了大量的代表团。在三月中，法国的劳动人民建议召开一次欧洲工人会议以反对复活德国军国主义，反对原子战争的威胁，争取各国人民之间友好与和平共处。这一建议在法国和欧洲各国获得了热烈的欢迎。
    四月二十二日至二十四日，在来比锡举行了有法国、德意志民主共和国等二十五个国家的代表参加的欧洲国家劳动人民和工会代表会议。
    来比锡会议是欧洲工人们反对重新武装德国，反对原子战争的一个集会，它将是对各族人民争取和平的斗争的宝贵的支援。它标志着欧洲各国工人及工会在走向统一和团结的道路上的一个重要阶段。
    在对国际形势作了这样简略的分析之后，可以对我们的工会运动得出几点教训和值得注意的地方。很明显，劳动人民们已日益懂得：不管是欧洲或者是亚洲的和平存在危险的时候，全世界都会遭到威胁；他们日益懂得，他们是属于同一个保卫世界和平的队伍的。
    另一方面，劳动人民已日渐懂得，当资本主义各国政府在国际范围内执行着战争政策的时候，他们就在本国的范围内受到影响，他们的困难就会增长；他们就会成为反动势力进攻的目标，他们的权利和自由也会遭到蹂躏。这就证明世界工联理事会所规定的方针是正确的，那就是：工人们的行动不仅仅在于坚决要求满足他们的各项经济要求，同时也要坚决地反对战争的政策。
    各国工人的国际斗争在目前阶段的一个特点是：他们已经认识到，作为一个具有决定性意义的进步的和坚主和平的阶级，他们的力量鼓舞着并组织着人民对反原子战争罪恶计划的斗争。这个特点也表现在工人阶级和他们的各种组织提出了各种各样的争取统一团结的创议。
    劳动人民争取和平的斗争的目前阶段表明：在全世界工人阶级中，在各工地，在各工厂中存在着巨大的潜在力量，这些巨大的潜在力量应该鼓舞我们的信心和我们的活动以挫败我们的敌人。
    所以我们的任务就是要行动起来，要深入工作现场，和劳动人民群众保持经常的联系，以我们的组织和我们的经验去支持他们；到处都要帮助他们巩固统一行动，加强工会的国际团结。我们应以各种方法发展一切国家的工人们之间的兄弟般的联系，这是各族人民之间的友好联系的先决条件。我们应该推广中国工人们和他们亚洲各国兄弟间不断增加的友好来往，也要推广在欧洲工人兄弟中发展着的这种友好的联系。
    世界工联所属各组织应该在为着各族人民的生活和未来而在工人中进行的伟大的动员中，起着决定性的作用。
    这就是为什么我们的敌人，工人阶级团结的敌人到处（特别是在欧洲和亚洲）积极地施展各种活动，以诬蔑世界工联，分裂劳动人民并把他们纳入美国国务院所规划的政策的轨道。美国劳联和产联的反动头子们强使国际自由工联接受美国的法律，直接地干涉欧洲各工会的事务，对欧洲的劳动人民背诵华盛顿的指令，要他们帮助重新武装欧洲和德国人民的刽子手。
    他们在印度，特别是在日本展开紧张的活动，从事分裂劳动人民和他们的组织，试图防范国际团结和统一的巨大潮流，因为亚洲各族人民为争取和平的斗争支援了这个团结和统一的运动。但是他们是不能达到目的的，他们无法阻止资本主义各国劳动人民和已摆脱了资本枷锁的国家中的兄弟之间的友好联系的发展。他们也阻挡不了一九五五年五一节——国际团结和争取和平的节日——的成功。至于世界工联，它为这一走向团结和和平的不可抗拒的运动感到高兴。世界工联曾经并将尽一切努力来促使这一运动的发展。今年是世界工联的十周年纪念，它向各国劳动人民为争取和平而走向团结的坚强而有创造力的意志致敬。
