　　From Xinluhai to Qamdo
　　By Our Correspondent　Fu Dong
　　One day in March 1953, Lu Chao drove a car from Xinluhai to Qamdo.
　　It was already four o'clock in the afternoon, and the weather suddenly changed, with wind and snow. The biting whirlwind rolled up dense snowflakes and rushed towards the car in gusts. He accelerated, wanting to quickly cross Que'er Mountain and reach the Jinsha River to rest.
　　After the car had traveled only eighteen kilometers, he suddenly saw a car parked at the foot of Que'er Mountain. He drove over and saw the driver sitting in the driver's seat, losing his temper, muttering something. Lu Chao hurried forward to inquire, but the driver was too lazy to answer, only saying coldly, "The car is broken, no oil coming through." Lu Chao ran to the front of the car, opened the hood, unscrewed the oil pipe, and sucked hard on the oil pipe with his mouth. After sucking for a long time, no oil came up at all. He knew the pump was broken and took the whole pump off to inspect it for a while, discovering there was no spring. He guessed it must have fallen into the oil pan.
　　So he said to the driver, "Let's dismantle the oil pan!"
　　The other party glared at him and said, "I can't fix it."
　　Lu Chao knew the driver's feelings: to dismantle the oil pan, you had to lie under the car. There were many screws on the oil pan, and it would take at least an hour or two to lie there, unscrew them, and then put them back on. But the road surface was frozen a foot thick, covered with a layer of five or six inches of snow. It certainly wouldn't be pleasant to lie on.
　　After a while, the driver said angrily, "I'm going back to Xinluhai to settle the score with the technicians in the repair shop. How did they fix the car? It broke down after only a dozen kilometers."
　　Lu Chao calculated in his mind that it would take at least an hour and a half to drive back and forth to Xinluhai. And it was getting dark, the wind was blowing harder, and the snow was falling heavier. If they didn't cross the 5,300-meter-high Que'er Mountain, the dozens of road construction technicians in the car would have to spend the night in the wilderness at minus thirty degrees Celsius. How could everyone bear that?
　　"No, absolutely not!" He said to the driver, "I'll fix it. I'll be responsible for fixing it." He asked the driver to get the tools out, but the other party stood by the car without moving, looking embarrassed. It was getting dark, so he ran to his own car to get tools.
　　He found a very thick piece of firewood and scraped the snow off the ground. But what about the ice? The ice was harder than stone, and it couldn't be scraped away all at once with a knife, and time didn't allow for any more delay. He thought about putting the seat cushion from the driver's seat underneath, but the cushion was too thick, and if he put it down, he wouldn't be able to get under the car. There was nothing else to find. Without hesitation, he lay down in his cotton-padded clothes.
　　There were so many screws on the oil pan, densely packed, at least thirty or more. He couldn't take them off wearing gloves, so he had to take them off. Holding the pliers to remove the screws with bare hands was like holding a piece of ice, and before long his hands were so frozen that it was difficult to move them.
　　The wind howled sharply around him, making it difficult to even breathe, and his face and hands felt like they were being pricked by millions of needles. The blood in his whole body seemed to have frozen, and his upper and lower teeth were chattering, but he gritted his teeth and continued.
　　The sound of a car horn came from afar. A car was coming down the mountain. The car stopped when it reached them. Lu Chao heard the driver talking quietly with the people in the car that had just arrived. After a while, that car left. He called the driver, but no one answered after calling for a long time. It turned out that the driver had hitched a ride back to Xinluhai.
　　The road construction technicians in the car saw that Lu Chao had been lying on the ice for twenty minutes and called him out to rest. But he said, "It's okay, it'll be finished in a little while." He refused to come out no matter what. In fact, his hands had already turned from red to purple, and then from purple to blue. His legs and feet were numb, his whole body was ice cold, and he had lost feeling. The technicians in the car, seeing that he ignored them, forcibly pulled him out from under the car. Everyone felt bad and said, "This isn't even your car. Why are you suffering so much for us!" Lu Chao, upon hearing this, quickly said, "This is nothing. The People's Volunteers are fighting on the front lines, that's real suffering!" Then he said, "The sooner we get to the construction site, the sooner the road will be finished." He put his hands in his pockets to warm them for a while, and when his hands turned red and became a little more flexible, he lay down again.
　　After dismantling for a while, he finally took out the spring. Then he began to put the screws back on and install the oil pan. It took a full hour, front and back, to finish. He breathed a sigh of relief and tried to crawl out. But strangely, he couldn't move at all. He used all his strength but still couldn't move. He called four or five people to pull him together for a long time, and then he heard a "whoosh" sound, and his body moved. It turned out that his cotton-padded coat was frozen to the ice and couldn't move. Now it was torn off completely. When everyone dragged him out, his legs were shaking so badly that he couldn't stand, and his whole body was frozen blue and purple. Everyone helped him walk around for a while and wrapped him in five or six quilts, and then he moved around a little more easily.
　　The car was fixed, but there was no one to drive it. What to do? At this time, it was completely dark, and the blizzard hadn't stopped, with whirlwinds carrying snowflakes sweeping down from the mountain, making people shiver. Spending the night in such a blizzard would be unbearable. He was worried when he suddenly heard a car coming from behind. He was so happy that he forgot the pain in his body and hurried over to greet it. This was truly unexpected. Their company commander was in the car. He briefly reported the situation and asked the company commander to drive the broken-down car away.
　　Another hour passed. The car began to climb Que'er Mountain. The wind was still blowing hard, and when the snow on the mountain was blown by the wind, it was as if a house had collapsed. The car put on anti-skid chains and struggled to climb up. The slope was steep, and the snow was deep. After traveling a short distance, the snow had submerged the wheels. Just then, they suddenly encountered a ninety-degree hairpin turn. The car slid straight backward. Because it had stopped for so long, the oil in the carburetor had congealed, and the car was not flexible, and it couldn't go up no matter what. He quickly increased the throttle and desperately shifted gears, but it was useless. The tires spun wildly, but the car didn't move forward. He was as anxious as fire. He quickly jumped out of the car and stepped on the knee-deep snow to explore the road surface. The ice under the snow was as slippery and hard as glass. After walking for a while, his feet were frozen numb. He stopped and looked at the cliffs and precipices on the side of the road. He suddenly remembered the scene in the winter of 1951 when he passed by here and saw soldiers and workers working in the mountains hanging in the air. The weather was very cold at that time, and the saliva froze into ice flowers before it hit the ground. There was no place to stand in the mountains, so the soldiers and workers dug holes in the top of the mountain, inserted steel drills, tied one end of the rope to their waists, and the other end to the steel drills, and hung in the air like they were swinging, drilling blasting holes. Many people had many deep cuts on their hands from the cold, but none of them complained. In order to split the towering cliff barriers, many people risked their lives to climb to the cliffs to set off explosions. He also remembered what the soldiers and workers said at the time: Que'er Mountain may be high, but it’s not higher than our feet; the stones may be hard, but they’re not harder than our will; the ice and snow may be cold, but we have a heart full of heat to melt them. He asked himself: What kind of attitude did people have towards difficulties? Thinking of this, he suddenly felt energized.
　　He found a tire iron and a hammer in the car and used them to knock hard on the ice on the side of the road. When the ice was broken, he carefully dug out the sand under the ice little by little and spread it on the road. The technicians in the car, seeing him like this, also jumped out of the car to help. They worked like this for three hours before filling the hairpin turn with sand. With a great effort, the car turned past it.
　　The car climbed one kilometer and encountered another turn. Just like the first time, the car went up and slid down again. He had no choice but to knock ice, dig sand, and pave the road again, just like before, and everyone followed him. They completely ignored the blizzard swirling in the darkness. But this time that method didn't work, and the car went up halfway and slid back down. What to do? He walked back and forth on the road, pondering. He thought that if the ice on the road was cut into horizontal grooves, the car might not slide down. So he worked with everyone to do it. They carefully cut two hundred horizontal grooves, one after another, and spread some sand on top. When everything was done, it was already dawn.
　　The car went up, but the higher they went, the steeper the slope and the thicker the ice became. At a turn, they still couldn't climb up using the previous two methods. Five or six hours passed unnoticed. At this time, the snow stopped, and the sun came out. The snow-covered mountains became a misty expanse when the sun shone on them.
　　Everyone was also very anxious, and they started giving ideas, one after another. Someone said, "Wouldn't it solve the problem if we found some branches and straw to put under the wheels?" Someone else said, "Wouldn't it work if we took the tarpaulin off the car and put it under the car?"
　　Branches and straw would be good, but where could they find them? There was nothing but snow on this barren mountain.
　　Filling with the tarpaulin would certainly be good, but a tarpaulin cost more than three hundred yuan, and it would be scrapped if the car ran over it. How could they treat the people's property like that! That's what he thought in his heart. Suddenly, he thought of the cotton-padded coat on his body. This cotton-padded coat was already torn anyway, so he threw it under the tires. A repair technician in the car, seeing him like this, also threw down a cotton-padded coat.
　　The car moved, but as soon as it ran over the cotton-padded coat, the car slid down again. The cotton-padded coat was too small. So he put his two quilts in front of the front tires, put the two blankets in the middle of the car, and put two cotton-padded coats and an overcoat in front of the rear tires. He slowly drove the car over. After the car passed, he moved the things on the ground forward. He used this method to get past one turn after another.
　　When they reached the top of the mountain, it was completely dark again. The quilts, blankets, and cotton-padded coats were soaked by the car, as if they had just been pulled out of the river. At nine o'clock in the evening, the car finally crossed Que'er Mountain and arrived at the road maintenance crew's station at the foot of the mountain. The people in the car were extremely tired after working for a day and two nights. He parked the car at the road maintenance crew's station and helped everyone get off the car to boil water and cook, but he himself sat in the driver's seat and refused to get out. He said that the car had to be started every hour, otherwise the water tank would freeze. So, he put on an overcoat, lay down on the steering wheel, and took a nap. Then he busied himself checking the car and getting back on the road.

[Note] Comrade Lu Chao recently came to Beijing to attend the First National Congress of Model Workers in Highway Transportation (May 3rd to 11th). At the meeting, he reported on his 130,000 kilometers of safe driving and his experiences. The reporter interviewed him during the meeting. The above is a record of one of his exemplary deeds.

　　从新路海到昌都
　　本报记者　傅冬
    一九五三年三月的一天，路超开着汽车从新路海出发到昌都去。
    这时已是下午四点钟，天忽然变了，又刮风又下雪。刺骨的旋风翻卷着密密的雪片向汽车一阵阵扑来。他加快速度，想赶紧翻过雀儿山到金沙江去休息。
    汽车刚走了十八公里，他忽然看到在雀儿山的山脚下停着一辆汽车。他把车开过去，只见那驾驶员坐在司机台里正发脾气，嘴里咕咕哝哝不知说些什么。路超忙上前打听，那个驾驶员懒得答话，只冷冷地说：“车坏了，不来油。”路超跑到车前，掀开盖子，把油管的螺丝卸下，用嘴死劲吸油管。吸了半天，油一点没上来，他知道是泵浦坏了，就把泵浦整个儿拿下来检查了一会，发现没有弹簧，他推想准是掉到油底壳去了。
    于是他对那个驾驶员说：“咱们来拆油底壳吧！”
    对方瞪了他一眼，说：“我修不来。”
    路超知道那个驾驶员的心情：要拆油底壳一定要躺在汽车底下。油底壳上的螺丝很多，最少要躺个把钟头，才能把螺丝卸下再装上。可是那路面的冰冻得足足有一尺厚，上面还盖着一层五、六寸深的雪。人躺在上面当然不好过。
    停了一会，那个驾驶员气虎虎地说：“我要回到新路海去找修理班的技工来算帐，他们怎么修的车，刚走了十几公里就抛锚。”
    路超在心里算计了一下，从这儿到新路海坐汽车走一趟最少也得一个多钟头。而这时天已快黑，风越刮越紧，雪也越下越大，如果不翻过这五千三百多公尺的雀儿山，坐在车上的几十个修路技工，就要在这零下三十多度的旷野过夜，那大伙怎么能受得了？
    “不，绝不能这样！”他对那驾驶员说：“我来修，我负责修好。”他叫那驾驶员把工具拿出来，可是对方站在车边不动手，看样子是不好意思。天渐渐黑下来了，于是他就跑到自己的车上拿工具。
    他找了根很粗的柴把地上的积雪刮了刮。可是冰怎么办呢？那冰比石头还硬，用刀子刮也不是一下子就能刮完的，而时间也不允许再这样耽搁了。他想把司机台上的坐垫填在下面，但是坐垫很厚，一填上，人就没法钻到车底下了。找别的东西，又没有。他没有犹豫一下，就穿着棉衣躺了下去。
    油底壳上的螺丝可真不少，密密麻麻足有三十多个。他戴着手套没法拆，只好脱了。光手拿着拆螺丝的钳子，就像拿着块冰，没多大一会手就冻得很难动作了。
    风在身边尖声呼啸，吹得人连出气都很困难，他的脸上和手上就像千万只针在扎一样的疼，全身的血好像冻住了，上下牙碰的直响，但他咬紧牙关继续干下去。
    远远传来了汽车的喇叭声，有车子从山上下来了。那辆车走到跟前就停了下来。路超听见那驾驶员和刚来的那辆车上的人在低声说话。没一会那车走了。他喊那驾驶员，可是喊了半天没人答应。原来那驾驶员搭着别人的车回新路海去了。
    坐在车上的修路技工见路超在冰上躺了已经有二十分钟，就喊他出来歇歇。但他说：“不要紧，再停一会就完了。”说什么也不肯出来。实际上，他的两只手这时已经由红变紫，又由紫变青了。腿脚麻木，全身冰凉，失掉了知觉。车上的技工见他不理会，就硬把他从车底下拉出来。大伙都过意不去地说，这又不是你开的车，为了我们，你这么受罪！路超听了忙说：“这算什么，志愿军在前方打仗，才算苦哩！”接着又说：“咱们早一天到工地，公路就早一天修好。”他把手放在口袋里暖了一会，等手变红，稍稍灵活了些，能转动的时候，就又躺了下去。
    又拆了一会，才把弹簧拿出。接着又开始上螺丝装油底壳。这样前前后后足足搞了一个钟头，才收拾完了。他轻松地呼了口气就往外挪，想爬出来。可是奇怪，怎么也挪不动。他用尽全身的力量还是不能动弹。他叫了四、五个人一齐拉了好大一阵，只听见“嗤”的一声，身子才动了。原来背后的棉衣冻在冰上不能动，现在整个儿撕下来了。当大伙把他拖出来的时候，他的腿抖得站不住，全身都冻成青紫色的了。大伙搀着他蹓了一阵，又用五六条被子把他包起来，这才稍稍活动了些。
    车子修好了，可是没有人开，怎么办呢？这时天已完全黑了，大风雪还没有停止，挟着雪花的旋风从山上扫过来，吹得人直打哆嗦。在这样的大风雪里过夜，是够受的。他正在发愁，忽然听见后面有汽车来了。他高兴得忘记了身上的疼痛，连忙跑过去打招呼。这真是意想不到的事，车上坐着他们的中队长，他把情况简单地汇报了一下，就请中队长开着抛锚的那辆车走了。
    又一个钟头过去了。车子开始爬上雀儿山。风还是一个劲地刮，山上的雪被风一吹，就好像房子塌下来一样。汽车挂上防滑链条吃力地往上爬。坡陡雪深，走了不多一会，积雪就把车轮淹没了。正在这时，忽然遇到一个九十度的大回头弯。车子滑得直往后溜。因为刚才停了半天，车上的考帮油凝结住了，车子不灵活，怎么也上不去。他赶紧加大油门，拼命地调换排挡，可是没有用处，轮胎呼隆呼隆地直转，车子却不往前走。他心里急得像火烧一样。连忙从车上跳下来，踏着过膝深的雪探踩路面。雪下面的冰冻得像玻璃一样又滑又硬，走了一会，脚就冻僵了。他停下来，望着路边的悬崖绝壁，忽然想起一九五一年冬天他路过这儿看见战士和工人在山间悬空干活的情景。那时天气很冷，吐口唾沫还没有落地就凝结成了朵朵冰花。山间没站脚的地方，战士和工人就在山顶挖个窟窿，插上钢钎，把绳子一头拴在自己的腰间，一头拴在钢钎上，就像荡秋千一样，吊在半空中打炮眼。很多人的手上冻了很多很深的血口子，可是他们没一个抱怨的。为了劈开高达数丈的崖石壁障，很多人冒着生命危险爬到悬崖上去爆炸。他又想起战士、工人们当时所说的话：雀儿山再高，没有我们的脚板高；石头再坚，没有我们的意志坚；冰雪再寒，我们有满腔热血来溶化。他问自己：人家是以什么样的态度对待困难？想到这里，他觉得身上突然来了劲。
    他在车上找到一根撬胎棒子和一个榔头，使劲敲打路边的冰，等冰敲碎，他就用力一点一点把冰下的沙子挖出来铺在路上。车上的技工见他这样，也都跳下车来帮忙。这样折腾了三个钟头，才把这个回头弯铺满沙子。使了一把劲，车子转过去了。
    车子爬了一公里，又遇到一个弯子。像头一次一样，车子开上去又滑下来。他只好又照老法子敲冰，挖沙子，铺路，大伙也跟着他做。他们完全没有理会在黑暗里回旋的大风雪。可是这一回那法子不顶事了，车子上了半截又滑退了下来。怎么办呢？他在路上走过来走过去的琢磨，他想假如把路上的冰打成一道一道的横槽，车子也许就不会往下滑了。他就和大伙一道儿动手作。他们仔细地一道又一道地敲出二百道横槽，上面又铺了些沙子。等一切弄停当，这时天已大亮了。
    车子开上去了，可是越往上走，坡越陡，冰也越来越厚，在一个转弯处，用前两个办法仍爬不上去。五、六个钟头不知不觉地溜过去了。这时雪住了，出了太阳，满山的雪给太阳一照，成了雾茫茫的一片。
    大伙也心焦得了不得，这时就你一言我一语地出开了主意。有人说：“找些树枝、稻草填在轮子下不就解决问题了吗？”有人又说：“把车上的篷布拿下来填在车下不就成了吗？”
    树枝稻草好是好，可是到那儿去找呀！这荒秃秃的山上，除了雪，什么也没有。
    填篷布当然好，可是一个篷布要三百多元，汽车一压就报废了。那能这样对待人民的财产呀！他心里这样想。他突然，想起了身上的棉衣，这件棉衣反正已经弄破了，他就把它摔在轮胎底下。车上有位修理技工见他这样，也扔下一件棉衣。
    车子动了，可是刚辗过棉衣，车子就又滑了下来。棉衣太小了。于是他又把自己的两条被子填在前轮胎的前面，把两条毯子铺在车中间，后轮胎前摆了两件棉衣，一件大衣。他慢慢地把车开过去。等车走过去了，再把地上填的东西往前挪。他就用这办法渡过了一个又一个的弯子。
    上到山顶，天又完全黑了。被子、毯子和棉衣被车子压得湿淋淋的，就好像是刚从河里捞出来的一样。晚上九点钟车终于翻过雀儿山到了山脚下的道班房。车上的人折腾了这么一天两夜累得了不得。他就把车子停在道班房照护大伙下车烧水煮饭，可是他自己却坐在司机台里不肯下去。他说，车子隔一个钟头就要发动一次，不然水箱就冻住了。就这样，他披了件大衣，爬在方向盘上打了个盹。接着就又忙着检查车子赶路了。
    〔注〕最近路超同志来北京参加全国公路第一次劳动模范代表大会。（五月三日至十一日）他在会上报告了他安全行车十三万多公里的事迹和经验。记者在会议期间访问了他。上面记载的是他的一段模范事迹。
