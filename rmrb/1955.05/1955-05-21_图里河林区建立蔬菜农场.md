　  Vegetable Farm Established in Tu Li River Forest Area
    The Tu Li River Forest Area in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has recently established a vegetable farm with fifty hectares of cultivated land. The farm plans to plant thirty-eight hectares of vegetables such as Chinese cabbage, radish, and cucumber, estimating a yield of over 1.5 million jin (750,000 kg) of vegetables. Currently, the farm workers are sowing seeds and cultivating seedlings. All sowing will be completed by the end of June. After July, workers in the forest area will be able to eat fresh vegetables from the farm. To ensure that the forest area workers can eat fresh vegetables even in winter, the farm is also preparing to build two warm cellars with a total area of 2,000 square meters for storing vegetables. This will guarantee a year-round supply of vegetables for the forest area workers.

　  图里河林区建立蔬菜农场
    内蒙古自治区图里河林区，最近新建立一个拥有耕地五十垧的蔬菜农场。这个农场计划种植大白菜、萝卜、黄瓜等蔬菜三十八垧，估计可产蔬菜一百五十多万斤。现在农场职工正在播种和育苗，六月底，即可全部播种完。七月以后，林区的职工即可吃到农场的新鲜蔬菜。为了使林区职工冬天也能吃到新鲜蔬菜，农场还准备建立两个总面积达两千平方公尺的暖窖，以便储存蔬菜。这样就可以保证对林区职工的常年蔬菜供应。
