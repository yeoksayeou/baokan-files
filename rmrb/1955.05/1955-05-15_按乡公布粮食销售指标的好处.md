One important practice in rectifying the unified grain sales work is: announcing the state's grain sales quotas to the masses through township people's congresses and mass meetings, explaining to the peasants the state's grain sales situation in the local area, and analyzing whether the local demand for supply is reasonable.

Why announce grain sales quotas publicly? The effect of Wulong Township in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, in announcing quotas proves that there are the following benefits:

	I. It allows the masses to know how much grain the state can supply. In the past, the masses had no idea; those short of grain cried for it, and those not short of grain also cried for it. Now that they have a basis for understanding, those short will be guaranteed supply, and it is useless for those not short to cry, so they no longer cry, and the mood of the masses stabilizes.

	II. It can eliminate the idea of some grassroots workers simply relying on higher authorities to allocate more grain. In the past, when the masses demanded supplies, village cadres pushed it to the township, and township cadres pushed it to the district. Now that the cadres have a basis for understanding, they no longer push it upwards at each level, strengthen their sense of responsibility, and do more arduous and in-depth political and economic work among the masses.

	III. After the supply figures are made public, the masses have a basis for supervision, which can prevent individual staff from engaging in malpractice for personal gain, and also facilitate the exposure of the conspiracies of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries to spread rumors and sabotage.

	IV. It facilitates guaranteeing reasonable supply and not exceeding the state's grain sales quotas.

However, many staff members have concerns about announcing grain sales quotas by township. In March, Wulong Township, Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, supplied 48,416 catties of unprocessed grain; in April, the state's sales quota was only 25,180 catties of unprocessed grain. Staff members believed that the difference between the two figures was too large and dared not announce the April quota to the masses. The township branch secretary said: "If the figure is so small, what if the masses make trouble after it is announced?" Therefore, to announce the quota, it is necessary to first clear the cadres' minds and make them understand that they should not only look at the size of the supply figures, but also see whether the quota is in line with reality and whether it is reasonable. The staff of Wulong Township calculated the overall production, purchase, and sales of the entire township, and according to the output, after deducting the grain requisition and purchase figures, the people of the entire township had enough ration grain to eat for nine months. However, more than 40,000 catties of grain had been supplied in March. Furthermore, comparing village to village: Fifth Village, with 87 households, supplied 78 households in March, supplying nearly 10,000 catties of grain; Eighth Village, with 83 households, only supplied 14 households in March, supplying 1,500 catties of grain. After the calculation, the staff members all felt that the supply in March was unreasonable, and the supply figures for April should conform to the actual situation and took the lead in reducing their own supply plans.

Here is another example: In Jianshanjiao Village, Guli Town, Jiangning County, out of the village's 147 households, only 40 or so actually needed to be supplied. Village staff member Li Rongting and others were afraid that someone would make trouble in the future, so they took the initiative to issue supply certificates to 90 households. Three days after the certificates were issued, five surplus grain households came to the door to make trouble about the supply. The cadres were afraid of "offending people" and agreed as before. As a result, the masses made even more trouble. Later, Li Rongting attended a党员(dangyuan) assembly in the district, learned about the state's sales quota, and returned to hold a cadres' meeting to analyze the actual situation of the 90 supply households. Among the 90 households, five were cadres, and they declared on the spot that they did not need to be supplied. After the sales quota was announced to the masses, 44 of the 90 households that had already been issued certificates did not want to be supplied, and 18 households reduced their supply, so no one made trouble about the supply anymore.

Announcing grain sales quotas among the masses is an arduous political task and a meticulous economic task. Some cadres in Qingpu County, Jiangsu Province, adopted simple and crude methods to carry out this work, announcing the quota and saying to the masses: "The figure is just this much, you go and revise the plan!" Doing so cannot solve the problems in the work and will also cause dissatisfaction among the masses. On the basis of improving the understanding of township cadres, Wulong Township, Songjiang County, first announced it within the Party, calculated the overall accounts according to the actual situation of each village, discussed and determined the supply plan for each village, and verified the production, purchase, and sales of each peasant household, so that they had a clear understanding of the supply to each household; and then announced it to the masses. While announcing the figures, they used the fact that the past supply was unreasonable to educate everyone, and once again publicized the spirit of the unified sales policy and the significance of increasing production and saving. This approach worked very well. The original supply plan for the seven villages in Wulong Township in April was even larger than in March; after rectification, it decreased by 68.4 percent compared to March.

In individual townships, there may also be another situation: the state's sales quota is indeed not enough to supply, and the original plan of the masses, after verification, still exceeds the state's sales quota. This shows that the sales quota of this township is not in line with the actual situation. Therefore, when formulating quotas, the responsible comrades of the county and district Party committees should personally grasp the situation, and with the spirit of being equally responsible to the country and the people, check the actual sales situation of each township in the past few months, compare the grain production, purchase, and sales situation, and with the spirit of seeking truth from facts, formulate the grain sales quotas for each township in a practical way on the premise of ensuring reasonable supply. If the quota of individual townships is indeed not enough, appropriate adjustments should be made within the entire district and county. For peasants who are truly short of grain, it is necessary to guarantee supply according to their actual situation.

　　按乡公布粮食销售指标的好处
　　甄为民
    整顿粮食统销工作的重要做法是：按乡把国家的粮食销售指标，通过乡人民代表大会和群众大会向群众公开宣布，向农民说明国家对本地销售粮食的情况，分析本地要求供应的数字是不是合理。
    为什么要公开宣布粮食销售指标？江苏省松江县五龙乡公布指标的效果证明，有以下这些好处：
    一、可以使群众知道国家能够供应多少粮食。过去群众没有底，缺粮的喊缺，不缺的也喊缺；现在有了底，缺的保证供应，不缺的喊也没有用，就不再喊了，群众情绪就稳定下来了。
    二、可以消除某些基层工作人员单纯依赖上级多拨粮食的思想。过去群众闹供应，村干部向乡里推，乡干部向区里推。现在干部有了底，不再层层向上推，加强了责任感，多在群众中做艰苦深入的政治工作和经济工作了。
    三、供应数字公开后，群众监督有了根据，可以防止个别工作人员徇私舞弊，也便于揭发地主、富农、反革命分子造谣破坏的阴谋。
    四、便于保证合理供应，不突破国家的粮食销售指标。
    可是，对于按乡公布粮食销售指标，不少工作人员是有顾虑的。江苏省松江县五龙乡三月份供应了四万八千四百十六斤原粮；四月份国家销售指标只有二万五千一百八十斤原粮。工作人员认为两个数字相差太大，不敢向群众公布四月份的指标。乡支部书记说：“数字这么小，公布出去，群众闹起来怎么办？”因此，要公布指标，首先就要打通干部思想，使他们了解：不能只看供应数字的大小，而应该看看指标是不是符合实际，是不是合理。五龙乡的工作人员算了全乡产购销的大账，按照产量，扣去征粮、购粮数字，全乡群众留的口粮足够吃九个月。但是，三月份已供应了四万多斤粮食。再把村和村来比较：第五村八十七户，三月份供应了七十八户，供应了近万斤粮；第八村八十三户，三月份只供应了十四户，供应了一千五百斤粮。算账以后，工作人员都认为三月份供应不合理，四月份的供应数字应当符合实际情况，并带头核减了自己的供应计划。
    又有一个例子：江宁县谷里镇尖山脚村，全村一百四十七户，实际需要供应的是四十多户。村工作人员李荣庭等人怕将来有人闹，就主动照顾发了九十户的供应证。证发下去三天，就有五户余粮户吵上门来闹供应。干部怕“得罪人”，又照旧答应了。这样一来，群众闹得更凶了。后来，李荣庭到区里参加了党员大会，知道了国家销售指标，回来开干部会分析了九十户供应户的实际情况。九十户中有五户是干部，他们当场声明不要供应了。在群众中公布了销售指标以后，已发证的九十户中，有四十四户不要供应了，十八户减少了供应量，这样就再没有人闹供应了。
    在群众中公布粮食销售指标，是一项艰苦的政治工作和细致的经济工作。江苏青浦县有些干部，采取简单粗糙的办法去进行这个工作，把指标一宣布，向群众说：“数字就是这么多，你们去修正计划吧！”这样做，不能解决工作中的问题，还会引起群众不满。松江县五龙乡在乡干部提高认识的基础上，先在党内公布，按照各村实际情况算大账，讨论确定各村供应计划，核算每户农民的产购销情况，做到对各户的供应心中有数；然后再向群众公布。在公布数字的同时，以过去供应不合理的事实教育大家，再一次宣传了统销政策的精神和增产节约的意义。这样做，效果很好。五龙乡七个村四月份原来供应计划比三月份还要大；经整顿后，比三月份下降了百分之六十八点四。
      在个别乡里，也可能有另外一种情况：按照国家的销售指标确实不够供应，群众原订的计划，经核实以后仍然超过国家销售指标。这就说明了这个乡的销售指标不符合实际情况。因此，在制定指标时，县、区党委负责同志应当亲自掌握，以对国家对人民同样负责的精神，检查各乡过去几个月的销售实况，对比粮食产、购、销情况，以实事求是的精神，在保证合理供应的前提下，切实制定各乡粮食销售指标。如果个别乡指标确实不够，应在全区、全县范围内作适当调整。对于真正缺粮的农民，一定要按照他们的实际情况，保证供应。
