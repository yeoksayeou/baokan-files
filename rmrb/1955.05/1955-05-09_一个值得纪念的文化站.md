A Commemorative Cultural Center
　　Mǎ Jiā
　　Li Shu-jie led me to the Sunjia Street in Lushun.

　　This street is very spacious, paved with natural sand, white stones, and yellow earth. A highway in front leads to the harbor of Lushun, surrounded by mountains—Golden Hill, White Jade Hill, Lao Duo Hill, and Water Pond Hill—like a head of cabbage, wrapping Sunjia Street in the middle.

　　Li Shu-jie is from Sunjia Street. He used to be the street leader. He is familiar with the fort on the mountain, the White Pagoda, Black Stone, and green pine trees. Every item records a piece of history. Now recorded is the history of the eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union, as evergreen as the pine trees on Water Pond Hill.

　　We arrived at the front of a cultural center. It has white tiles on top and red brick walls all around. The window frames are painted with blue lead oil, and the windows and doors are inlaid with glass, wiped clean and bright. Standing outside, you can see the residents studying inside: people are sitting neatly, leaning over their desks, intently reading books. Li Shu-jie glanced into the room, raised his eyebrows happily, and pointed to me, saying:

　　“Look, this cultural center was built with the help of Soviet comrades.”

　　Then he began to talk about the history of this cultural center.

　　“Originally, this cultural center was very simple. Especially in 1949, when a typhoon hit, with wind and rain, the roof tiles were blown off, the walls collapsed, the glass was shattered, and the ground was full of mud and water, making it impossible to step on. Later, although the typhoon passed, the cultural center reopened, but only a few people came to class.

　　In the autumn of the year the typhoon struck, Soviet Army Major Balyeyev came to find me. He said to me straightforwardly:

　　‘Street leader, what difficulties do you have that we can help with?’

　　‘No! You helped us when the typhoon hit. Now that the typhoon has passed, we have no difficulties.’

　　Major Balyeyev raised his head and firmly objected: ‘No, your cultural center is not good. The walls are dark, the ground is damp, the glass is broken. When it’s windy and rainy, the people studying are as if they are in the open air.’ He seemed to have investigated the cultural center, knowing everything clearly. I said: ‘Our cultural center is not good, but we can still hold classes. We have financial difficulties and cannot repair it for the time being.’

　　Major Balyeyev earnestly asked: ‘If you have difficulties, why don't you bring them up for us to help with!’ The next day, Major Balyeyev drove over in a large truck and sent us three bags of lime, five bags of cement, and more than twenty pieces of glass for the cultural center. From then on, the cultural center was freshly painted, and more people came to study.”

　　We entered the room of the cultural center. The room was whitewashed, the floor was concrete, the walls were plastered with lime, and the glass was installed on the blue window frames, transparent and bright. There were two rows of desks and two rows of benches on the floor. Sitting on the benches were the residents of Sunjia Street, men and women, a total of more than forty people. Each person was flipping through books, looking at the female teacher on the podium. The female teacher had just left the blackboard, put down the chalk, turned around, and said to a woman in the front row with a bun in her hair: “Ning Gui-qiu, you talk about lesson twenty-nine.” Ning Gui-qiu was a short, small person with thick fingers pinching the pages of the book, looking at it, and slowly reading aloud. "Water connects to water, mountains connect to mountains, the great alliance is the Soviet Union, the Soviet people are the most heroic..." The female teacher prompted: "Tell us, how are the Soviet people heroic, and how do they help us?"

　　So Ning Gui-qiu began to tell the story of how the Soviet big brother saved her child Lanzi. She said:

　　“In 1949, a typhoon raged for half a month, with strong winds and torrential rain, non-stop. The seawater in the harbor rose, the flood on Water Pond Hill broke out, sand and stones rolled down the mountain, uprooting small trees and knocking down telephone poles. The flood rose to the doorstep. I was really worried. The roof was leaking rain, the windows were sweeping rain, and the ground and stove pit were all filled with water. It was difficult to light a fire and cook a meal. Coincidentally, Lanzi's father had gone out to work as a tile worker. Three children were pulling on my legs. I could only take care of one thing at a time. Lanzi was only six years old and didn't understand much. She would cry when she was cold or hungry, making me dizzy. One day, at noon, I opened the door and looked at the sky. The clouds in the sky were flying along the mountain, the dark ones piled up like gray lumps, and the light ones revealed the blue sky. The heavy rain had just stopped for a while, and the eaves were still dripping water. The flood from the mountain flowed down, flooding the main street, rushing out a ditch, and flowing straight into the ground of the house. The house was no longer habitable. It might collapse and crush people. At this time, Li Shu-jie walked over barefoot, shouting from house to house to move. When he saw me, he said: ‘Ning Gui-qiu, the house is flooded, quickly move to the cultural center!’ I hesitated, not believing it in my heart: ‘Moving to the cultural center, what's the point?’ Li Shu-jie said to me: ‘There are Soviet big brothers helping us move there. If the water is high, we'll go up the mountain. The cars have all come out.’ When I heard that there were Soviet big brothers helping, my heart was at ease. I hurriedly grabbed a package of clothes, carried a bag of corn, held one child, and led one child. I also wanted to hold onto Lanzi, but I couldn't free my hands. Well, I'll look for her next time! The street was full of rainwater flowing down from the mountain, floating grass roots and leaves, flowing towards the river. At the entrance of the street, a Soviet soldier was standing guard, wearing a raincoat and carrying a gun, braving the rain without moving, to guard the things of the common people. I didn't know him, but I admired him from the bottom of my heart. I trudged through the water with two children, and with great difficulty, I arrived at the entrance of the cultural center. There were five Soviet trucks parked at the entrance. Many people were gathered here, holding children, carrying packages, carrying tables, some were throwing things into the car. Several Soviet big brothers were helping to carry things, very busy. I put down my package and bag, arranged my two children, and hurried home. When I returned home, the flood had flooded the house, but Lanzi was not in the house. I shouted a few times anxiously, but there was no response. I hurriedly ran to the street to shout, trudged a few steps in the water, and saw a Soviet big brother coming out of the water, holding my Lanzi. Lanzi's eyes were wide open, and white foam was coming out of her mouth. When I saw Lanzi, I felt sad and cried. Li Shu-jie walked over and pointed to the Soviet big brother and said to me: ‘Your Lanzi chased you out, fell into the water, and was washed into the rapids. This Soviet big brother rescued her, you quickly thank him!’ I looked, and this Soviet big brother was the one who had been standing guard just now, took off his raincoat, threw down his gun, was soaked all over, looked at me, and then looked at my Lanzi, as if he was happy for us, and smiled with his mouth open. I was also happy in my heart. How can I thank him? Even if I took out my heart, I could not repay the kindness of the Soviet big brother."

　　We left the cultural center. Li Shu-jie was very excited, telling me as we walked:

　　"Comrade Ma, in this cultural center, Sino-Soviet friendship education is carried out every Saturday. It is not about dead textbooks, but about living people and real events. Everyone who comes to the cultural center to study has a story of friendship with the Soviet army. What Ning Gui-qiu told just now is just one of many stories."

　　I asked: "How many people have studied here?"

　　"Since the typhoon, more than 300 people have graduated from the cultural center. At least they can recognize 800 characters, can write and calculate. Some people have even joined the workforce."

　　一个值得纪念的文化站
　　马加
    李树洁领我来到了旅顺的孙家街道。
    这条街很宽敞，铺着天然的沙子、白石和黄土，前边的一条公路通到旅顺的港湾，周围是一圈山，有黄金山、白玉山、老朵山、水池山，像是一棵卷心白菜，把孙家街包在中间。
    李树洁是孙家街道的人，当过街长，他熟悉山上的炮台、白塔、黑石、青松；每件东西，都记载着一段历史。现在记载的，是中苏永恒的友谊历史，如同水池山上的松树，万年长青。
    我们走到一所文化站的门前，它的上头盖着白瓦，四围是砌着红砖的墙，窗户框刷着蓝铅油，窗户和门都嵌着玻璃，擦得溜明崭亮，站在外面，可以看到屋里居民学习的情形：人们坐得很整齐，伏在桌子上，聚精会神地看着书。李树洁向屋里望一望，高兴地扬起了眉毛，指着对我说：
      “你看，这个文化站，是苏联同志帮助我们搞起来的。”
    接着谈起这个文化站的历史来。
    “原来这个文化站很简陋，特别是一九四九年刮台风，风雨交加，扫得房子落了瓦，坍倒了墙，玻璃打得稀碎，地上全是泥水，下不去脚。后来，虽然台风过去了，文化站又开了课，来上课的人稀稀拉拉，没有几个。
    刮台风的那年秋天，苏军巴列耶夫少校来找我。他直截了当对我说：
      ‘街长，你们有什么困难需要我们帮助？’
      ‘不！刮台风的时候，你们帮助了我们，台风过去了，我们没有困难了。’
    巴列耶夫少校抬着头，坚决地反对说：‘不对，你们的文化站不好，墙壁黑，地皮湿，玻璃破了，刮风下雨，学习的人就像在露天里一样。’他仿佛到文化站调查研究过，什么都清清楚楚。我说：‘我们的文化站不好，也对付能上课，经费困难，暂时还不能修。’
    巴列耶夫少校认真地跟着问：‘你们有困难，为什么不提出来让我们帮助呢！’第二天，巴列耶夫少校开来了一辆大汽车，送给我们文化站三包石灰、五包水泥、二十多块玻璃。从那以后，文化站粉刷一新，学习的人也多了。”
    我们走进文化站的屋子。屋子粉刷得漂白，水泥打地，石灰抹墙，玻璃安在蓝窗框上，透明透亮。地上放着两趟书桌，两趟凳子；坐在凳子上的都是孙家街道的居民，男的、女的，一共有四十多人，每个人都翻着书本，望着讲坛上的女教师。女教师刚刚离开黑板，放下粉笔，转过身子，对着前排一个挽着发髻的妇女说：“宁桂秋，你讲讲二十九课。”宁桂秋是一个小矮个子，粗手指头捏着书页，望一望，慢声细语地念。“水连水，山连山，伟大的盟邦是苏联，苏联人民最英雄……”女教师提示说：“你讲讲，苏联人民怎样英雄，对咱们有什么帮助？”
    宁桂秋于是就讲起了苏联老大哥怎样救了她的孩子兰子的故事。她说：
      “一九四九年刮台风，一连闹了半个月光景，刮着大风，下着瓢泼大雨，停也不停。港湾的海水出潮，水池山上发了洪水，沙子石头往山下滚，拔了小树，撞倒电线杆子，大水涨到了家门口。我真发愁，屋顶漏着雨，窗户扫着雨，屋地和灶坑全灌进了水，烧把火，煮顿饭也很困难。偏巧兰子她爹出了门，在外边做瓦工。三个孩子扯着腿，我顾了这头，顾不了那头。兰子刚刚六岁，不大懂事，冷了就喊，饿了就哭，闹得我蒙头转向。有一天，午间，我拉开房门，望望天；天上的云彩顺着山头飞，深的堆成灰疙瘩，浅的露着青天。大雨刚停一会，房檐还滴着水。山上的洪水淌下来，漫了当街，冲了一道沟，一直淌进了屋地。屋子已经住不得人，说不定那会房倒屋塌，压死人。这时候，李树洁光着两片脚走过来，挨家逐户吆喝着搬家。他看见我就说：‘宁桂秋，屋子都进来水了，快搬到文化站去吧！’我打着迟，心里信不及：‘搬到文化站，又有什么办法？’李树洁对我说：‘那里有苏联老大哥帮助咱们搬家，水大就上山，汽车都开出来了。’我一听说有苏联老大哥帮助，心就落了体，急忙忙挟了一个衣裳包袱，背了一条苞米口袋，抱着一个孩子，领着一个孩子，我还想拉住兰子，怎么也腾不出手来。那末，就等下一次来找她吧！街上尽是从山上下来的雨水，漂着草根和树叶子，正往河里流淌。在街口上，有一个苏军同志站岗，披着雨衣，背着枪，为了看守老百姓的东西，顶着雨不动地方。我不认识他，我从心里钦佩他。我趟着水，带着两个孩子，非常吃力地到了文化站门口；门口停着五辆苏联的大汽车，好多老百姓都聚拢到这里，抱孩子的、背包袱的、抬桌子的，有的正往车上扔东西；有几个苏联老大哥帮助拿东西，忙的挺欢。我放下包袱和口袋，安排好两个孩子，匆匆忙忙赶回家去。回到了家，大水漫了屋地，屋里却没有兰子。我着急喊了几声，也没动静。我又急忙跑上大街喊，趟了几步水，看见一个苏联老大哥从水里出来，抱着我的兰子。兰子叫水淹得直瞪眼睛，嘴里吐着白沫。我看见兰子，心里一难过，就哭了。李树洁走过来，指着苏联老大哥对我说：‘你们兰子追你出来，掉到水里，冲到急流里，这位苏联老大哥把她救上来，你快谢谢吧！’我一看，这位苏联老大哥就是方才站岗的那个人，脱了雨衣，扔下枪，浑身精湿，瞅瞅我，又瞅瞅我的兰子，好像替我们高兴，张着嘴乐。我心里也乐，我怎样感激呢？就是把我的心掏出来，也报答不了苏联老大哥的恩情。”
    我们离开了文化站，李树洁的心情很兴奋，一边走着路，一边告诉我说：
      “马同志，在这个文化站里，每星期六都进行一次中苏友谊教育，讲的不是死的课本子，是活的人、真的事，每一个到文化站学习的人，都有一段和苏军友谊的故事，方才宁桂秋讲的，就是许多故事里的一个。”
    我问道：“有多少人在这里学习过？”
      “从刮过台风到现在，在文化站毕业的有三百多人，顶少能认八百字，能写能算，有的人还参加了工作”。
