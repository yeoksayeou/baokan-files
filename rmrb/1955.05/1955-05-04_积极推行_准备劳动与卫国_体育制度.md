Actively Promote the "Prepared for Labor and National Defense" Sports System
　　Sun Ming
    Promoting the "Prepared for Labor and National Defense" sports system (referred to as the "Labor and Defense System") is an effective means of providing comprehensive physical education to the people of our country, especially the youth. The Labor and Defense System has clear patriotic training goals, specific and progressive training objectives, and comprehensive scientific training requirements. It stipulates several mandatory and optional test items according to people's different genders and ages, in order to comprehensively train people's strength, speed, agility, and endurance.
    In the past year, the effect of promoting the preparatory level of the Labor and Defense System and piloting the Labor and Defense System in secondary schools and above has been good. It has a significant effect on improving school physical education teaching, comprehensively developing students' bodies, cultivating communist morality, and improving sports technical levels. In the past, many physical education teachers often adopted an irresponsible "free-range" teaching method, teaching whatever they knew and whatever they liked; after piloting the Labor and Defense System, physical education teachers changed their old ways, established new viewpoints, and strived to comprehensively train students' bodies. Students in various places who participated in the Labor and Defense System training generally felt that their health level had improved, thereby increasing their learning efficiency. Among more than 200 students aged 15 to 19 in Beijing, those who regularly participated in training had an average weight of more than one kilogram more, a chest circumference of more than one centimeter wider, and a right-hand grip of more than two kilograms stronger than those who did not participate in training often. In Tangshan City, 408 students from the Kailuan Coal Mine Workers' Children's Middle School participated in Labor and Defense System training. In less than a year, 118 people had reached the first-level standard of the Labor and Defense System, and another 78 people were only one item away from reaching the standard. In the Labor and Defense System training, students' collectivism and excellent qualities of cherishing public property were also cultivated.
    Facts have proved that promoting the Labor and Defense System has a huge effect on enhancing the physical fitness of the people of our country. The current task is to universally promote this system in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Secondary schools and above should actively promote the Labor and Defense System. As for factories, mines, enterprises, and government agencies, they should continue to consolidate and develop broadcast exercises, organize training groups and promote the preparatory level of the Labor and Defense System according to the different hobbies and requirements of the masses, in order to prepare conditions for the future promotion of the Labor and Defense System. Conservative views in promoting the Labor and Defense System should be criticized, and blind and rash advances should also be prevented.
    School administrative leaders should earnestly lead students to carry out Labor and Defense System training, and should explain to them the significance, role, and purpose of the Labor and Defense System. At the same time, they should strengthen their guidance. The textbooks of physical education classes should appropriately include the sports items of the Labor and Defense System, so that students understand the training methods and techniques. They should also use rich and diverse teaching materials so that students can appropriately carry out various sports games and competitions in the Labor and Defense System training, so as to improve their interest in training. The attitude of opposing the Labor and Defense System and regular physical education classes is incorrect. The guidance work for promoting the Labor and Defense System in schools should mainly be undertaken by physical education teachers. Therefore, physical education teachers must learn and familiarize themselves with the Labor and Defense System.
    In the process of promoting the Labor and Defense System, various localities and units should combine the season and the progress of physical education classes to conduct regular tests in batches and in stages in a planned and organized manner. And try to use the method of competition to encourage everyone's enthusiasm and improve sports performance. Those who pass the test should be awarded Labor and Defense System badges and certificates.

　　积极推行“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度
　　孙明
    推行“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度（简称劳卫制），是对我国人民，首先是对青年进行全面体育教育的有效手段。劳卫制具有鲜明的爱国主义的锻炼目的和具体的循序渐进的锻炼目标以及全面的科学锻炼要求。它根据人们的不同性别、不同年龄规定了几种必测的和选测的项目，以全面地训练人的力量、速度、灵敏和耐久力。
   一年来，在中等以上学校推行劳卫制预备级及试行劳卫制的效果是良好的。它对学校体育教学的改进、学生身体的全面发展、共产主义道德品质的培养，以及运动技术水平的提高，都有着显著的作用。过去，许多体育教师往往采取不负责任的“放羊式”教学方式，会什么教什么，爱什么教什么；试行劳卫制后，体育教师改变了过去的一套做法，树立了新的观点，努力使学生身体得到全面锻炼。各地参加劳卫制锻炼的学生，普遍感到提高了健康水平从而增进了学习效率。北京市二百多个十五岁至十九岁的学生中，经常参加锻炼的比不常参加锻炼的平均体重多一公斤以上、胸围宽一公分以上，右手握力多二公斤以上。唐山市开滦煤矿职工子弟中学有四百零八人参加了劳卫制锻炼，不到一年，已有一百一十八人达到劳卫制一级标准，还有七十八人差一项就可达到标准。在劳卫制锻炼中，还培养了学生的集体主义和爱护公共财产的优良品德。
    事实证明：推行劳卫制对于增强我国人民体质，是有巨大的作用的。目前的任务是，在中国人民解放军中普遍推行这种制度，中等以上学校则应该积极推行劳卫制，至于厂矿、企业、机关，应继续巩固发展广播体操，根据群众的不同爱好和要求，组织锻炼小组和推行劳卫制预备级，为将来推行劳卫制准备条件。应该批判在推行劳卫制工作中的保守观点，也应防止盲目冒进的现象。
    学校行政领导同志应当认真地领导学生进行劳卫制锻炼，应当向他们说明劳卫制的意义、作用和目的，同时要加强对他们的指导工作。体育课的教材中应当适当包括劳卫制的运动项目，使学生懂得锻炼方法和技术。并应运用丰富多样的教材，使学生在劳卫制锻炼中能适当地进行多种多样的运动游戏和竞赛，提高锻炼的兴趣。那种把进行劳卫制和体育正课对立起来的态度是不对的。学校中推行劳卫制的指导工作，主要应由体育教师担任。因此，体育教师必须学习和熟悉劳卫制。
    在推行劳卫制的过程中，各地各单位应该结合季节和体育课的进度，有计划、有组织地分批、分期进行经常的测验。并尽量利用竞赛的方式，以鼓舞大家的热情，提高运动成绩。成绩合格的应该授予劳卫制证章、证书。
