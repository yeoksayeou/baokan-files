On the evening of the 7th, the foreign ministers of seven countries—Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg—began meeting in Paris to establish a new Western European military alliance. The meeting elected Belgium's Goffin as the Secretary-General of the permanent secretariat of the Western European Union, located in London. The council, composed of the foreign ministers of the Western European Union member states, will continue to meet on the 10th.

The North Atlantic Aggression Group Council meeting began on the 9th. The foreign ministers of the original fourteen member states, including the United States, and the West German Foreign Minister attended the meeting. The meeting is scheduled to end on the 11th. According to the United States Information Service, this Council meeting will discuss the report of the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, "exchange views on common policies," "study Soviet policies," and "study the relationship between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union."

West German Chancellor and Foreign Minister Adenauer arrived in Paris to attend these meetings. United Press International’s Bonn dispatch quoted West German government officials as saying that Adenauer will quickly proceed with the rearmament of West Germany after returning home from Paris.
