Xinhua News Agency, Berlin Dispatch: The West German Federal Constitutional Court announced that the illegal "trial" of the German Communist Party, originally scheduled to continue between May 10th and 17th, has been postponed again, and the date of the court session has not yet been determined.

The repeated postponement of the "trial" of the German Communist Party fully demonstrates that the Federal Constitutional Court has encountered great difficulties in carrying out the task stipulated by the Bonn government to ban the German Communist Party.

On the 16th, 1,000 citizens of Mainz, West Germany, held a rally demanding an end to the "trial" of the German Communist Party. People in Darmstadt and Qisun, Hesse, have also recently signed protests against the continuation of the "trial." In late April, "struggle days" against the "trial" of the German Communist Party were held in many parts of West Germany.

　　西德联邦宪法法院再度延期“审讯”德国共产党
　　西德各地人民纷纷要求停止对德共的“审讯”
    据新华社柏林电　加尔斯卢合消息：西德联邦宪法法院宣布，原定于五月十日到十七日之间继续举行的对德国共产党的非法“审讯”已经再度延期，开庭日期还没有确定。
    “审讯”德国共产党的一再延期充分表明，联邦宪法法院在执行波恩政府规定的禁止德国共产党的任务中遇到了巨大的困难。
    十六日，西德美因兹的市民一千人举行了集会，要求停止对德国共产党的“审讯”。黑森州的达姆斯塔德和歧孙的人民最近也签名抗议继续进行“审讯”。四月下旬，在西德许多地方举行了反对“审讯”德国共产党的“斗争日”。
