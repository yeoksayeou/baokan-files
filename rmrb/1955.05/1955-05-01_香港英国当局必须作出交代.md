The Asian-African Conference has concluded victoriously, but the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents who murdered the staff members of the Chinese delegation attending the Asian-African Conference and Chinese and foreign journalists have not yet been arrested and brought to justice. This situation cannot but make people feel extremely indignant.

The "Kashmir Princess" plane was sabotaged by American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in a premeditated manner, which has been proven and affirmed by more facts and more people. The statement of Air India International has confirmed that the explosion and fire of the plane were caused by external reasons completely unrelated to the structure of the plane itself. The work of salvaging the plane is now underway. According to a report by "The Times of India" reporter Reddy from Singapore on April 27, preliminary investigations indicate that two explosions occurred, probably in the baggage compartment and the right wing section. Officials of the Singapore Civil Aviation Authority believe that this was clearly caused by two small time bombs secretly placed on the plane. Reddy said: "This conclusion was reached by experts."

Reddy's report irrefutably proves that the plane exploded due to a time bomb, and the time bomb could only have been placed by American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents mixed in the airport when the plane stopped in Hong Kong. Obviously, the British authorities in Hong Kong, who had been warned by the Chinese government in advance, bear extremely serious responsibility for this unfortunate incident because they did not take all steps to prevent the sabotage activities of the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. The British authorities in Hong Kong must, without delay, arrest all the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents who planned and carried out this murder and bring them to justice.

But until now, the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong have been more busy trying to shirk their responsibilities than actively pursuing the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents who planned and carried out this murder. On the one hand, they claim that nothing can be investigated in Hong Kong, and they do not pursue the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, especially the agents hiding in the airport that the Hong Kong authorities are clearly aware of; on the other hand, they repeatedly investigate our personnel in Hong Kong and demand that our government provide more materials. They attempt to create the impression that the problem does not lie with the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in Hong Kong, but rather with our own personnel in Hong Kong. They turn a blind eye to the large number of American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents who are blatantly active under their noses, and do not investigate them, but instead ask us for more "intelligence"! This attitude of the British government cannot but make people suspect that the reason why the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents who planned and carried out the murder have not been arrested and brought to justice so far is because the British authorities are afraid that arresting them would confirm their responsibility for this incident, and are afraid that it would expose the Hong Kong British authorities' connivance and protection of the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents.

This erroneous attitude of the British authorities has obviously greatly encouraged the American aggressive bloc and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, to deny their crimes. They first tried their best to publicize that the plane crash was due to so-called mechanical failure. Then, the day after Air India International issued a statement based on the talks of three survivors, the United Press reporter from Taipei, the "New York Herald Tribune" reporter from London, and the "Christian Science Monitor" reporter from Hong Kong, all simultaneously slandered China, saying that China's "reaction was too fast" to the plane crash, so it seemed that the plane was sabotaged by China itself. The United States Information Agency, the official propaganda organ of the United States, even openly publicized the absurd argument of coming to China to investigate. The purpose of the United States instructing its propaganda machine to carry out such slander is to deny its own crimes and insult China by making false accusations. It is not difficult to imagine that the United States also wants to please Britain, help Britain shirk its responsibility, and obtain Britain's continued connivance at the activities of the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in Hong Kong.

But, who can be deceived by this absurd slander of the American propaganda machine? The Chinese government knew in advance that the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents were going to sabotage this Indian plane and murder the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, so it could immediately make a correct judgment after the plane crash and immediately expose it. This is not surprising at all. The United States has consistently deliberately avoided the possibility of American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents sabotaging the plane, and attempted to shift the world's attention to China, which only exposed how guilty it was.

Now, the preliminary investigation results have proven the correctness of the Chinese government's judgment. The American aggressive bloc's slander against China has completely gone bankrupt, and it has begun to panic. According to a report by "The Times of India" reporter Reddy, "The US consul in Singapore has requested the Singapore Civil Aviation Authority to allow a representative of Lockheed, the company that manufactures the Constellation aircraft, to participate in the ongoing preparatory investigation." The company's regional representative based in Sydney has arrived in Singapore. Obviously, the American aggressive bloc is now trying to intervene in the investigation in order to sabotage the investigation and destroy evidence. It must be pointed out that the United States is now in the position of the accused in the plane incident, and no one from the United States should be allowed to participate in any stage of the investigation of this incident. If any relevant party allows the United States to interfere in the investigation, it will consciously or unconsciously fall into the trap of the United States and help the United States realize its conspiracy to shirk its responsibility and shift the blame to others.

Hong Kong has always been a major base for American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents to carry out sabotage and subversive activities against China. For several years, they have committed countless crimes under the connivance and protection of the British authorities. The "Kashmir Princess" incident is one of their most serious crimes. The activities carried out by American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents using Hong Kong have constituted a direct threat to China's security. This situation is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The British authorities must immediately take responsibility and give an explanation to the angry Chinese people with concrete actions of immediately arresting American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents.

### 香港英国当局必须作出交代

　　香港英国当局必须作出交代
　　蒋元椿
    亚非会议已经胜利地结束了，但是谋杀出席亚非会议的中国代表团工作人员和中外记者的美蒋特务却还没有被逮捕法办。这种情形不能不使人感到十分愤慨。
      “克什米尔公主号”飞机是被美蒋特务预谋破坏的，已为更多的事实和更多的人所证明和肯定。印度国际航空公司的声明已经证实飞机的爆炸和起火是由于同飞机构造本身完全无关的外来原因造成的。打捞飞机的工作现在正在进行。据“印度时报”记者雷迪四月二十七日从新加坡报道说，从初步调查的结果看来，飞机大概是在行李仓和右翼翼段中发生了两处爆炸，新加坡的民用航空当局人士认为，这显然是由秘密安置在飞机上的两枚小的定时炸弹所引起的。雷迪说：“这一结论是由专家们得出的。”
    雷迪的报道不容置辩地证明：飞机是由于定时炸弹而爆炸的，而定时炸弹只能是当飞机在香港停留时由混在飞机场内的美蒋特务安放的。显然，事先得到过中国政府的警告的香港英国当局，由于没有采取一切步骤来防止美蒋特务的破坏行为，对于这一不幸事件负有极端严重的责任。香港英国当局必须毫不迟延地将布置和执行这一谋杀的美蒋特务全部缉拿归案，予以法办。
    但是到现在为止，英国政府和香港英国当局与其说是在积极追捕策划和执行这一谋杀行动的美蒋特务，倒不如说是在忙于推卸它们应负的责任。它们一方面声称在香港调查不出什么来，对美蒋特务不进行追究，尤其是对香港当局明知隐藏在机场中的特务不去动弹；而另一方面却一再向香港我方人员进行调查，并要求我国政府提供更多的材料。它们企图制造这样的印象，似乎问题不是出在香港的美蒋特务身上，而反倒是出在香港我方人员自己身上。它们对于在它们鼻子底下公然蠢动着的大批美蒋特务，熟视无睹，不加查究，却反而问我们这里要什么更多的“情报”！英国政府这种态度，不能不使人怀疑策划和执行谋杀行为的美蒋特务之所以至今未被逮捕法办，是由于英国当局唯恐逮捕了他们，就会证实它对这一事件应负的责任，唯恐因此而暴露了香港英国当局对美蒋特务的纵容和包庇。
    英国当局的这种错误态度，显然大大鼓励了美国侵略集团和它的走狗蒋介石卖国集团抵赖自己罪行的勇气。它们先是竭力宣传飞机失事是由于所谓机件故障。随后在印度国际航空公司根据三名生还者的谈话发表声明以后的第二天，合众社记者从台北、“纽约先驱论坛报”的记者从伦敦、“基督教科学箴言报”的记者从香港，立刻异口同声地诬蔑中国，说中国对于飞机失事的“反应太快”，因此似乎飞机是中国自己破坏的。美国官方宣传机关美国新闻处并且公然宣扬要到中国来调查的荒谬论调。美国方面授意它的宣传机器进行这样的诬蔑，其目的是为了抵赖自己的罪行，并含血喷人地侮辱中国。不难想像，美国还想借此讨好英国，帮助英国推脱责任，以取得英国对于美蒋特务在香港的活动的继续纵容。
    但是，美国宣传机器的这种荒唐的诬蔑能骗得了谁？中国政府在事先早就知道美蒋特务要破坏这架印度飞机，谋害以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团，因此在飞机失事以后可以立刻作出正确的判断，并且立即加以揭露。这是完全不足为奇的事情。美国方面一贯地故意闪避美蒋特务破坏飞机的可能性，企图把全世界的视线转移到中国身上来，这只是暴露了它是多么作贼心虚。
    现在，初步调查的结果已经证明了中国政府判断的正确性。美国侵略集团对中国的诬蔑彻底破产，它开始发慌了。据“印度时报”记者雷迪报道，“美国驻新加坡的领事已经要求新加坡的民航当局让制造星座式飞机的洛克希德公司的一个代表一起参加现在进行中的准备性调查”。这家公司驻在悉尼的地区代表已经到达新加坡。很明显，美国侵略集团现在力图插手到调查里面去，来破坏调查，消灭罪证。必须指出，美国在飞机事件中现在处于被告的地位，在关于这一事件的调查的任何阶段中，决不能容许美国方面的任何人参加。任何有关方面如果允许美国插手干涉调查，它就会自觉或不自觉地落入美国的圈套，帮助美国实现其推托罪责、嫁祸于人的阴谋。
    香港一向是美蒋特务对中国进行破坏和颠覆活动的大本营。几年来他们在英国当局的纵容和包庇下干下了无数罪行。“克什米尔公主号”事件是他们的最严重的罪行之一。美蒋特务利用香港来进行的活动，已经构成了对中国安全的直接威胁。这种情形是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。英国当局必须立即负起责任来，用立即逮捕美蒋特务分子的具体行动向愤怒的中国人民作出交代。
