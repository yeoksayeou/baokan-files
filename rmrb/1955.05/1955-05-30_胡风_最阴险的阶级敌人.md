　　Hu Feng - The Most Insidious Class Enemy
　　Ba Ren
    Hu Feng, whether viewed ideologically or politically, is our class enemy, the most insidious class enemy lurking within our revolutionary ranks.

    Class enemies never sleep when it comes to the revolutionary cause led by our working class. For twenty years, Hu Feng has been mixed in with our revolutionary ranks, in fact serving these class enemies.

    Before liberation, he pretended to be a revolutionary literary worker, but could freely come and go under the rule of the reactionary Kuomintang, publishing periodicals to attack our Party's literary and art cause. His attacks on us were not particularly covert, aside from the curses in his letters to his clique. After liberation, he adopted a set of "underground work" methods, using Party newspaper letterhead and envelopes, writing state organ addresses, to issue orders. His counter-revolutionary activities also expanded and deepened day by day. He strengthened his own ranks, becoming an anti-Party group with "organizational principles." He incited his followers to infiltrate our Party. He secretly dispatched "secret agents" to steal Party documents. He contacted people, won people over to establish strongholds, and prepared to actively attack.

    Hu Feng wanted to overthrow the entire revolutionary cause led by our Party. Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" were slandered by him as a "totem" believed in by people of primitive societies. He accused this speech of "stifling the vitality of realism." In order to strategically oppose it, he told his group members "don't touch it literally, and where possible, follow it, as I did in 'Lu'." He wanted to walk a path of his own, saying he wanted to "walk out of a group of robbers and swindlers." Who are the "robbers and swindlers" in Hu Feng's eyes? They are the Party and non-Party literary and art workers who are striving to follow Comrade Mao Zedong's speech. Doesn't that mean that the New Democratic revolution and socialist revolution led by our Party are also "robber and swindler" undertakings? Isn't this the same thing that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and American imperialism are saying?

    Class enemies always sing the same tune.

    Since Hu Feng regards our revolutionary cause as a "robber and swindler" undertaking, then isn't his active activity today, starting with a frenzied attack, then retreating step by step, and attempting to "seek rebirth in suffering," "everything is for the cause, for a more distant future," isn't it to carry out his counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy?

    The Chinese people will never allow Hu Feng and his anti-Party group to realize their conspiracy! We must resolutely and thoroughly crush it, and eliminate all conspiracies of class enemies!

　　胡风——最阴险的阶级敌人
　　巴人
    胡风，不论从思想上、从政治上看，都是我们的阶级敌人，是混在我们革命阵营里最阴险的阶级敌人。
    阶级敌人对我国工人阶级领导的革命事业是决不会睡觉的。二十年来，胡风混在我们革命阵营里，事实上就是为这些阶级敌人服务的。
    解放以前，他假冒是个革命文艺工作者，但可以在反动国民党的统治下，自由地来去，办刊物攻击我们党的文艺事业，他对我们的进攻是并不十分隐蔽的，除了他给他集团的信上的咒骂以外。解放以后，他采取了一套“地下工作”的方法，借用党报的信纸信封，写上国家机关的地址，来发号施令。他的反革命活动也日益扩大和加深了。他加强了自己的队伍，成为一个有“组织原则”的反党集团。他唆使党羽，打进我们党内。他密遣“暗探”，盗窃党内文件。他联络人、争取人建立据点，准备积极进攻。
    胡风是想推翻我们党所领导的整个革命事业的。我们党的领袖、中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，被他污蔑为原始社会的人所信仰的“图腾”。他指斥这个讲话“把现实主义底生机闷死了”。他为了策略地反对它，叫他的集团的分子“字面上不要去碰它，可能的地方还要顺着它，如我在‘路’所做的”。他为自己要走出一条路来，说是要“在强盗和骗子群中走出来”。谁是胡风眼中的“强盗和骗子”呢，那就是遵循毛泽东同志的讲话而努力着的党和非党的文艺工作者。那不是等于说，我们党所领导的新民主主义革命事业和社会主义革命事业也就是“强盗和骗子”事业了吗？这难道还不是蒋介石卖国集团和美帝国主义说的话吗？
    阶级敌人总是唱着同一调子的歌曲。
    既然胡风把我们的革命事业看作为“强盗和骗子”事业，那末，他今天这样积极地活动，始而疯狂地进攻，继而有步骤地退却，并且企图“在忍受中求得重生”“一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来”，难道不是要贯彻他那反革命复辟的阴谋吗？
    中国人民是决不容许胡风及其反党集团实现他们的阴谋的！必须坚决彻底粉碎它，肃清一切阶级敌人的阴谋活动！
