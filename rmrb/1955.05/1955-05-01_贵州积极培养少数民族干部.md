Guizhou Actively Cultivates Ethnic Minority Cadres

    Up to now, Guizhou Province has cultivated more than 9,000 ethnic minority cadres who are no longer engaged in production, including 124 at or above the county level. The vast majority of these cadres are activists in various patriotic movements. They maintain close ties with the ethnic minority people and have played a significant role in leading mutual aid and cooperation, carrying out patriotic production increase movements, and promoting ethnic unity. Many of these cadres have studied at the Guizhou Provincial Institute for Nationalities, cadre schools, or training classes. By the end of 1954, more than 1,500 students had graduated from the Guizhou Provincial Institute for Nationalities alone; currently, there are more than 1,000 students enrolled. Through the education of the Party and the tempering of practical work, these cadres have greatly improved their political and ideological level. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,600 ethnic minority cadres in the province have joined the Communist Party of China. Most of the ethnic minority areas have established organizations of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. In the Miao Autonomous Region of Lushan County, 63 Communist Party branches and 64 Communist Youth League branches have been established in 60 townships. The Party and Youth League branches have established a high prestige in leading various tasks. (Our correspondent in Guiyang)

　　贵州积极培养少数民族干部
    贵州省到目前为止，已培养出脱离生产的少数民族干部九千多人，内有县级以上的一百二十四人。这些干部绝大多数是各项爱国运动中的积极分子，他们和少数民族人民有密切联系，在领导互助合作、开展爱国增产运动和促进民族团结等方面，发挥了很大作用。这些干部有不少是在贵州省民族学院、干部学校或训练班学习过的。到一九五四年年底，仅在贵州省民族学院毕业的学员，就有一千五百多人；目前在校的有一千多人。这些干部经过党的教育和实际工作的锻炼，政治思想水平有了很大提高。据不完全统计，全省有一千六百多名少数民族干部参加了中国共产党。少数民族地区大部建立了中共党的组织和青年团的组织。炉山县苗族自治区六十个乡镇中，建立了六十三个中共支部和六十四个青年团支部。党、团支部在领导各项工作中已树立了很高的威信。　（本报驻贵阳记者）
