To the Editor:

On the Jining-Erlian railway line, there are many touching stories of unity between the Mongolian and Han peoples. Now, let me tell you about two very ordinary little things!

It was a late autumn night last year.

A young mother was lying on the bed, about to give birth. Her husband, Liu Xuchang, a switchman at the Qisumu station, was on duty at the station. The expectant mother had no relatives around, and was especially anxious and nervous.

The old wife of the landlord, Shi Mengge, Baden Gerbu, paced back and forth at the door, her heart in a mess. She frowned, thinking to herself:

      "Help her deliver the baby? This is such a dirty thing (according to Mongolian customs, hands that have delivered a baby cannot cook for a month)! Especially for a Mongolian to help a Han person deliver a baby, that is something unheard of! ...

      "Who doesn't have parents, who doesn't have children, if she were at home, could her mother see her daughter about to give birth and not care? They left their homes and came here, all for the sake of our people on the grasslands to live a good life. Now, comrades are busy with work, and they can't even take care of their families when their wives are about to give birth. Can we still not care?"

Thinking of this, the old woman ran into the room in three steps, panting and asking her old husband, who was "bata bata" smoking on the kang, to go to the station to call for an obstetrician quickly, and then hurried into the expectant mother's room.

The expectant mother lay panting on the bed, the baby was about to be born. At this moment, the old woman Baden Gerbu forgot the old habits, busily helping the expectant mother deliver the baby, wrapping the child, and lighting a fire to cook eggs for the baby's mother to eat.

By the time the baby's father rushed back, the baby was already lying peacefully in its mother's warm embrace...

A few days later, Liu Xuchang and his wife took the baby to visit their relative. The baby's mother excitedly said to the old woman: "Eme (mother), my child and I will always remember you!"

The Mongolian youth Sang Bu, a commercial clerk at the Daliuhao station, joined the railway work in February last year. At noon on March 2nd last year, he suddenly felt a stomach ache, which became more and more severe, so painful that he rolled around in bed. When the comrades at the station found out, they immediately asked the doctor from the First Engineering Section's clinic nearby. The diagnosis was acute appendicitis. The clinic could not treat it, and it would be too late to wait for the train after work to send him to the bureau's hospital for treatment. What should be done? Stationmaster Huang Jiliang (a Communist Party member) immediately contacted a worker at the First Engineering Section and arranged for a jeep to take him there.

When the driver, Comrade Zhao Lianshui, heard that a Mongolian youth had contracted an acute illness, he rushed over without even bothering to eat. He drove the car carefully, quickly and steadily – he had to race against time and avoid jolting the patient. The patient arrived safely at the bureau hospital. After being injected with painkillers and diagnosed, he was transferred to the People's Hospital for treatment that night. After examination, it was confirmed that it was acute appendicitis, and surgery was performed immediately.

Sang Bu was hospitalized for more than half a month, and the doctors and nurses took care of him warmly like their own brothers and sisters. The comrades at the station all wrote letters to comfort him, and even sent a representative to visit him specifically, instructing him to rest assured and recover his health as soon as possible.

All of this deeply moved Sang Bu. Afterwards, Sang Bu wrote down his personal feelings in the "Railway Engineering" of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways under the title "Everywhere is Home, Everywhere is Warm": "The Han comrades' love for me like this is something I will never forget. Only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can the Mongolian and Han peoples be so united and loving. I can only repay the Party and comrades' kind care with practical achievements in my work."

There are countless such stories that can't be told or written about enough. The past of mutual hatred and killings between the Mongolian and Han peoples, instigated by reactionary rulers, is gone forever. Today, the flowers of Mongolian-Han friendship have blossomed all over the Jining-Erlian railway line, all over the grasslands.

　　集二线上的蒙汉民族友谊编辑同志：
    在集二线上，传诵着很多感动人的蒙汉两族人民团结的事例。现在，让我向你们叙述其中两件很平凡的小事吧！
                ×　×　×
    这是去年一个深秋的夜晚。
    一个年轻的妈妈仰卧在床上，快要临产了。她丈夫刘绪长，是七苏木车站的扳道员，正在站上值班。产妇眼前没有一个亲人，分外焦急和紧张。
    房东石盟格的老伴巴登格尔布在房门口踱来踱去，心里乱得慌。他紧锁着眉头，暗自思量：
      “替她接生？这是一件多么肮脏的事（按照蒙民的风俗，接过生的手一个月不能做饭）！特别是蒙民给汉人接生，那更是从来没有听见过的事！……
      “谁没有父母，谁没有子女，要是她在家里，她的母亲能看到自己的女儿临产不管吗？他们离乡背井到这里来，还不都是为了咱们草原上的人们能过好日子。如今，同志们工作忙，家里要生孩子都顾不得回来招呼。咱们还能不管吗？”
    想到这里，老妈妈三步并做两步跑进房里，气喘喘地让正在炕上“巴搭巴搭”吸烟的老伴到站上去叫老刘赶快请接生员，接着又急匆匆地进了产妇的房间。
    产妇气喘喘地躺在床上，孩子快要降生了。在这当儿，巴登格尔布老妈妈忘记了那老的习惯，忙着替产妇接生，包裹小孩，又生火给孩子的妈煮鸡蛋吃。
    等孩子的爸赶回来时，孩子已经安详地躺在妈妈温暖的怀里……。
    过了几天，刘绪长夫妇抱着孩子特地去看望自己的亲人。孩子的妈妈激动地向老妈妈说：“额莫
  （妈妈），我和孩子永远会记住您！”

    大六号车站商务员蒙族青年桑怖，是去年二月新参加铁路工作的。去年三月二日中午，他突然感到肚子痛，越痛越厉害，直痛得他在床上乱滚。站上的同志知道了，马上到附近第一工程段医务所请来了大夫。诊断结果是急性盲肠炎。医务所没法治，要是等下班火车送到局里医院去治又太迟了，怎么办呢？站长黄继良同志（共产党员）立即和一段记工调度联系，派吉普车把他送去。
    司机赵连水同志听说是一个蒙族青年得了急病，连饭也没有顾上吃就赶来了。他小心谨慎地把车开得又快又稳——既要抢时间，又耽心颠着病人。病人平安地到了局医院，经注射了止痛剂并作了诊断以后，当晚转送人民医院医治，经过检查，确定是急性盲肠炎，当时就动了手术。
    桑怖住院半个多月，大夫和护士同志们就像亲兄弟姐妹一样热心地护理他。站上的同志们都写信来安慰他，还特地派了代表来看望他，嘱他安心休养，早日恢复健康。
    这一切都深深地使桑怖感动。事后，桑怖在铁道部第三工程局的机关报——“铁道工程”上用
  “处处是家，处处温暖”为题写下了他的亲身感受：“汉族同志对我这样的爱护，是我永远不能忘记的。只有在共产党、毛主席的英明领导下，蒙汉两族人民才能这样团结友爱。我只有以搞好工作的实际成绩，来报答党和同志们的亲切关怀。”
    像这样的事情是多得说不完写不尽的。在反动统治者挑拨下，蒙汉两族人民互相怀恨和仇杀的往事，已一去不复返了。今天，蒙汉民族友谊的花朵已开遍在集二线上，开遍在整个草原。　刘难先
