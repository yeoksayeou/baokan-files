　　Do Not Restrict Farmers from Raising Chickens
　　To the Editor:
　　In late March, the people's representatives of the eighth electoral district of Tangpu Township, Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, held a meeting. At the meeting, Wang Aying, the director of the representative group, made arrangements for increasing grain production. During group discussions, everyone spontaneously proposed: chickens and ducks will ruin grain, and to increase grain production, we must raise fewer chickens or keep the chickens locked up. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that chickens and ducks were not allowed to roam freely. If chickens were not properly confined, people were allowed to beat them if they saw them outside. Subsequently, Chen Rongsheng, the head of the Nan Shunbin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tangpu Township, led a team of more than ten people to form a chicken-beating squad, killing three chickens and four ducks on the spot. Chen Rongsheng and others then cooked and ate the dead chickens and ducks in a small temple. On the same afternoon, farmers from the eighth and ninth mutual aid teams killed two chickens belonging to the Nan Shunbin Agricultural Production Cooperative. So far, this chicken-beating phenomenon has not stopped. Seeing that raising chickens and ducks is not guaranteed, the masses have been selling them off one after another. Currently, about 70% of the chickens and ducks in Tangpu Township have been sold.
　　This situation is also constantly occurring in Haining County, Zhuji County, Wuxing County, and Pinghu County. This is contrary to the government's policy of supporting rural sideline production. It is hoped that relevant departments will quickly pay attention to correcting this.

　  不要限制农民养鸡编辑同志：
    三月下旬，浙江嘉兴县塘濮乡第八选区的人民代表开了一次会议。会上，代表主任王阿应对增产粮食问题作了布置。小组讨论时，大家自发地提出：鸡鸭会糟蹋粮食，要增产粮食，就要少养鸡或者把鸡关起来养。讨论结果，决定鸡鸭不准外放，如不把鸡关好，外人可以看到就打。此后，塘濮乡南顺滨农业生产合作社社长陈荣生带领十多个人组织了打鸡队，当场打死了鸡三只，鸭四只，并且由陈荣生等把打死的鸡鸭在一个小庙里烧熟吃了。同一天下午又有八、九两个互助组农民打死南顺滨农业生产合作社鸡两只。到目前为止，这种打鸡现象仍未停止。群众看到养鸡鸭没有保障，就纷纷卖掉鸡鸭。现在，塘濮乡已有百分之七十左右的鸡鸭卖掉了。
    这种情况，在海宁县、诸暨县、吴兴县和平湖县也在不断发生，这是和人民政府扶持农村副业生产的政策相违背的，希望有关部门迅速注意纠正。
