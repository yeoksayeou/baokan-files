The editorial board notes: Since the publication of Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," people have been outraged by the evil deeds of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary, anti-party, and anti-people activities. Our newspaper has received a large number of articles and letters from readers across the country, all demanding a thorough exposure of Hu Feng and his clique's crimes. This indignation is unstoppable. However, some people who sympathize with Hu Feng, or who verbally oppose him but inwardly sympathize with him, say that the materials are mostly from before liberation and cannot be used to determine guilt. Well, let's see the second batch of materials.

The materials now published are excerpts from sixty-eight secret letters written by Hu Feng to members of his reactionary clique after national liberation. In these letters, Hu Feng viciously slanders the Party, the Party's literary policies, and Party leaders; he curses Party member writers and non-Party writers in the literary field. In these letters, Hu Feng directs his reactionary clique to carry out anti-Party and anti-people activities, secretly and systematically organizing them to launch a fierce attack on the Party and the literary front led by the Party. In these letters, Hu Feng incites his followers to infiltrate the Party and revolutionary organizations to establish bases, expand "strength," and gather information and steal Party documents. In these letters, one can clearly see that after liberation, Hu Feng used more cunning tactics: publicly, he says, "Don't touch it," and "where possible, follow the Party and the people"; but secretly, he sharpens his sword, watches for opportunities, and uses the tactic of "Na Sun entering the stomach" to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. When his attacks on the Party fail, he quickly directs his followers to retreat, "seek rebirth in endurance," and prepare a set of fake confessions for each person to hide and wait for an opportunity to rise again. This proves the extreme seriousness of Hu Feng and his clique's counter-revolutionary conspiracy. We must be extra vigilant and not fall for their trick of false surrender.

Most of Hu Feng's correspondence with members of his clique is conducted in a secretive and hidden manner. Hu Feng and his followers agreed to use various codes and jargon in their letters. Party leaders, literary leaders, and Party member writers are all referred to by code names. The names of the recipients and Hu Feng's own signatures are also inconsistent; the names on the envelopes are often the wives or other people of the recipients; the signatures at the end of the letters often change or are not signed. Many of Hu Feng's letters use envelopes and stationery from "People's Daily" and "Liberation Daily," and many envelopes are addressed to "Shanghai New Literature Publishing House, delivered by Luo," "Shanghai Youth Daily, delivered by Luo," "Beijing Central Academy of Drama, delivered by Zhang," or other organization names.

Below are excerpts from these secret letters, divided into three categories based on content, roughly arranged in chronological order, with necessary annotations. The dots in the letters are original.

**First Category: Hu Feng's Slander and Attacks on the Party, Party Leadership, Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and the Literary Field**

1. May 30, 1949, Hu Feng to Lu Ling (Beijing)
    The literary field is shrouded in great suffering. Many people are like wearing shackles, but the desire for health is universal. Like a young bride, constantly fearing a beating, it exists.

    [Wearing shackles] In May 1949, as national victory was imminent, everyone was joyful. But Hu Feng, arriving in Beijing from Hong Kong via Northeast China, immediately cursed the literary field of New China as "shrouded in great suffering" and "wearing shackles."

2. January 12, 1950, Hu Feng to Lu Ling (Beijing)
    We will win, but the process will not be simple. I think we need to be more calm and more determined, and a five-year period is not too pessimistic. The small magazine should be made better. It cannot be used as a base, but we are, a cough will attract attention and be recorded.

    [Small magazine] Refers to the magazine "Starting Point" published by the Hu Feng clique in Shanghai shortly after national liberation.

3. January 18, 1950, Hu Feng to Lü Yuan (Beijing)
    I received your letter of the 13th yesterday. First, after publication, it startled everyone. But the favorites, some pretended not to see it. That's good. Second, except for those close to us, there is no opinion here. In Tianjin, it has ignited. In the Fourth Section, there is fierce shooting. How is it in your place?

    [First] [Second] Refers to Hu Feng's own poems "Time Begins" and "Hymn of Joy." [Favorites] Refers to Party literary workers. [Fourth Section] Refers to the fourth part of "Time Begins," "Requiem," which madly slanders the revolution and the people.

4. January 29, 1950, Hu Feng to Lü Yuan (Beijing)
    I will leave in about three or four days, wanting to bring the past to a close, sort things out, print a little, and then start slowly. Of course, it is also difficult in Shanghai, there are too many flies and mosquitoes.

    [Flies and mosquitoes] Hu Feng's insult to all revolutionary literary workers.

5. April 16, 1950, Hu Feng to Lü Yuan (Shanghai)
    I am a "difficult person," it seems there is nothing strange about it. Our society is too old, some people, even after changing clothes, still follow old habits, and you can tell they are wearing Western suits as a robe. In February and August, they wear clothes randomly, let's see their exhibition of strange and exotic clothes. There is no need for the poet Zhou to worry, everyone can see it. As for me, because I have some experience, I can tell it will rain just by smelling the air. But I think, after the first shot, the problem is no longer entirely with Old Boss Zhou, let's see what the board of directors thinks, he has to look at the board of directors' faces. But of course, you still have to look at the opponent, and you have to look at the public's reaction. But the board of directors has no experts, they want their own people not to lose face, and they don't know the real situation; the public's reaction does not come out; the opponent, has already pretended to be dead and lain down. The problem is like this. But I think they themselves also feel that the arrow on the string is released too quickly, too fiercely, exposing the position too early, making it a bit difficult to handle. These days, they are actively promoting something, passively scolding chickens, showing that they are not just archers in this aspect, and dispersing the public's attention. It can also be said that Brother Mei's notice saved them a hand.

    [Poet Zhou] Refers to Zhou Yiqi. Zhou once wrote a letter to Lü Yuan, asking him to persuade Hu Feng to confess. [Old Boss Zhou] Refers to Zhou Yang. [Board of directors] Hu Feng's derogatory term for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. [Brother Mei] Refers to Chen Shumei, also known as Aleng. After the "People's Daily" published Chen Yong and Shi Du's criticism of him in March 1950, he wrote a short article admitting his error in quoting the translation of Marx's works. The "notice" mentioned here refers to this short article. The "first shot" refers to the "People's Daily's" criticism of Aleng.

6. May 20, 1950, Hu Feng to Jia Zhifang (Beijing)
    Your elder brother's letter is obviously written on orders. This shows that those people are very insincere and uneasy, so they want to use this method to lay the groundwork first. The matter of Shumei has made them have illusions. But Shumei will also counterattack.

    You responded well. You should deal with such shameless surrender tactics like this. In the next letter, you can talk about other things. This is an outpost of struggle, probably a big explosion within one or two years. That letter, I hope you can show me, absolutely. Something can be studied from it.

    [Elder brother] Refers to Jia Zhi. [Those people] Refers to the Party, referring to Jia Zhi's letter as written by the Party. [Shumei] Refers to Aleng.

7. August 26, 195X, Hu Feng to Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing)
    The small book that has become a "totem" is now the most difficult problem. The problem is not necessarily that it has such a great relationship, but that some low-intelligence and malicious people have intensified their actions. For example, the saying "observe, experience, study, analyze," someone with a heart should grasp "experience" to raise questions and develop it. But their actions are completely the opposite. This has successfully created some chaotic and mechanical bureaucratic practices, strutting around, suffocating the vitality of realism, especially for young and unknown authors. The situation has strengthened this big knot: those "critics" are all in power, others dare not even hum, any demand from reality will be suppressed with fear and trembling. In this way, will it not wither away?

    I think you should not stop writing because of this. Of course, you should not touch it on the surface, and where possible, you should follow it, as I did in "The Path." But of course, writing works, you don't need to care about it, although it is very difficult to publish in their magazines now. Don't stop working, I think this is the most important thing. The path can only come from the deep demands of the people, come from the midst of robbers and swindlers, endure humiliation and walk out, otherwise there is no way.

    [The small book that has become a "totem"] This is Hu Feng's derogatory term for Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." (In primitive society, people worshipped a kind of animal or other natural object as sacred, calling it a "totem.") [As I did in "The Path"] "The Path" refers to Hu Feng's "On the Path of Realism." The content of this reactionary pamphlet is completely against Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," but sometimes it says a few words in accordance with the surface, here Hu Feng wants his clique to adopt the same method to deceive readers. [Robbers and swindlers] Derogatory term for Party members and revolutionary literary workers.

8. January 16, 1951, Hu Feng to Niu Han (Beijing)
    This literary world ruled by zombies, I even feel uncomfortable publishing my works.

    But I am sharpening my sword, watching the direction, and when I am sure, I am willing to cut off my head and throw it out to smash the filthy iron wall.

    [Publishing my works] Refers to the publication of Hu Feng's poem "Time Begins" in newspapers and magazines.

9. June 24, 1951, Hu Feng's wife Mei Zhi to Lu Ling (Shanghai)
    I think it is good that you can go to Korea, don't care about the motives of "people." Their tactic of leading the tiger away is bound to fail, the tiger raised will be more spirited and able to fight!

    [Leading the tiger away] Mei Zhi falsely accuses Lu Ling's going to Korea as the leadership's tactic of "leading the tiger away."

10. September 28, 1951, Hu Feng to Lü Yuan (Beijing)
    When I went, I got along very well with some of my colleagues in their "primitive" state. If I return with them after they have been "transformed," it will be even better.

    [Colleagues] Refers to people who went to Sichuan with Hu Feng to participate in land reform.

11. February 8, 1952, Hu Feng to Lü Yuan (Shanghai)
    Now, what can be done is still to do "heart surgery" from a theoretical perspective. I want to use this step to push the actual situation. But this is really a troublesome "trouble." First, you have to read some chaotic things, but you have to endure the physiological disgust. Now only such practice is possible.

    [Heart surgery] Refers to fundamentally destroying the Party's literary policies and theories. [Chaotic things] Refers to the works of revolutionary writers.

12. March 17, 1952, Hu Feng to Xie Tao (Shanghai)
    Brother Yu going to that school will have a great harvest. I think, if possible, spend some time collecting materials on that old man Huang Yewen. If his face can be exposed, it will be a great merit for the future of literature.

    [Brother Yu] Refers to Lu Yu, Xie Tao's wife. [That school] Refers to Beijing Normal University.

13. May 24, 1952, Hu Feng to Lu Ling (Shanghai)
    Looking at the commemorative editorial, it seems to have seen the problem, the killing intent seems to be there, but it is no longer willing to say it too openly!

    [Editorial] Refers to the editorial in "People's Daily" commemorating the 10th anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

14. May 25, 1952, Hu Feng to Xie Tao (Shanghai)
    Therefore, plan to write an article, grasp one or two key points (not discussing the past), support the "Speech." Because someone proposed it, it cannot be done otherwise. Write it and come to Beijing for face-to-face guidance.

    ["Speech"] Refers to Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

15. October 27, 1952, Hu Feng to Niu Han (Beijing)
    Now, writers are all seeking salvation in ideological inspection, seeking salvation in Marxism-Leninism, we do not have this fortune.

    This letter is Hu Feng's slander of revolutionary literary workers studying Marxism-Leninism and slandering ideological reform.

16. August 17, 1953, Hu Feng to Man Tao (Beijing)
    Now, it is precisely the time for bit by bit struggle, we must follow organizational principles, but organizational principles are to ensure struggle. We must face reality and cherish our strength; otherwise, retreating one step means retreating ten steps, retreating ten steps means becoming a shadow. Today, we are in the process of seeking a turning point, and there must be no unnecessary casualties.

    [Organizational principles] Refers to the organizational principles of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

17. August 22, 1953, Hu Feng's wife Mei Zhi to Jia Zhifang (Beijing)
    Will Ren Min come to Beijing once as planned? I have been here for almost a month. Female workers are still not hired, only a correspondent from the Writers' Association is helping, but he only makes me busier, public officials cannot help but be cautious.

    [Ren Min] Refers to Jia Zhifang's wife. [Writers' Association] Refers to the Chinese Writers' Association.

18. March 26, 1954, Hu Feng to Luo Luo, Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing)
    I am starting to gather materials. Before starting, I always feel a bit nauseous, but once I start, I can't help but laugh. There are such low-intelligence and stupid beasts in the world! But of course, it is a troublesome thing, but it has to be done.

    [Gathering materials] Refers to Hu Feng starting to write a report to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Hu Feng curses those who have criticized him in this letter.

19. June 16, 195X, Hu Feng to Ji Hong (Beijing)
    People like Yang, like a small woman, cannot be treated as a person. An article about Cao Yu wants to use it as capital for a brilliant career, "hope" published Lu Ying's criticism, and since then, a blood feud has been formed. What else can be said?

    [Yang] Refers to Yang Hui.

**Second Category: How Hu Feng Expanded His Reactionary Clique, Established Activity Bases, Sent His Clique Members to Infiltrate the Party, and Carried Out Activities Such as Stealing Documents and Gathering Information**

1. May 7, 1949, Hu Feng to Fang Ran, Ji Hong, Zhu Guohuai, Luo Luo, etc. (Beijing)
    Friend Boshan (Peng Bingshan's current name) works in the Political Department of the 24th Army. When I replied to his letter, I mentioned you and Shuxing, Shumei, and if possible, asked him to find you to work. But Ran has old relationships, it seems better to go through old relationships. Zhang Youyu was appointed as the deputy mayor of Beijing, and if necessary, you can telegram him, I plan to meet him in person.

    [Shuxing, Shumei] Refers to Lu Ling, Aleng.

2. May 30, 1949, Hu Feng to Lu Ling (Beijing)
    Received Peng Bingshan's (Boshan) letter, he went to Nanjing and has written to you to meet. Perhaps you have already met. But I don't know how the conversation went? According to the situation, the newly written things can be shown to him first. The uncultured people in Nanjing who do cultural work have been together before, maybe Boshan can introduce you to him.

    Several people in Hangzhou, I have introduced them to Boshan. This letter did not mention it. According to the situation, when asked, you can bring it up to discuss. If you see Baiding, you can also bring it up to discuss. When introducing to Boshan, I said that I absolutely guarantee him politically. Xiao Liu, Luo Luo in Shanghai, when there is an opportunity, you can also bring it up to discuss.

    [Boshan] Refers to Peng Boshan. [Baiding] Refers to Xu Pingyu. [Xiao Liu, Luo Luo] Both are members of the Hu Feng clique.

3. September 4, 1949, Hu Feng to Lu Ling (Beijing)
    Have you found Xu Pingyu? You should find him, the Mingying matter (best to return to the original place), the script matter, the work matter. The script, after revision, ask him to look at it, ask him to "give suggestions," this is a good "habit" that has been formed. In the future, you should find him more, and the future work should be done under his understanding and agreement, this is in accordance with general rules. He said he is willing to support you, then you should strive for his support, for the work. In the current situation, you must do this well.

    So, find Baiding, the Mingying matter is best to return to the original place, with the reason that she can cultivate technical personnel, which is actually the case. The script, after revision, give it to Baiding to look at, and let him initiate the performance. I said a bit of my opinion, he agreed very much. Also, you should have good contact with his wife (Lin Guo).

4. February 16, 195X, Hu Feng to Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing)
    I think, do what can be done, endure what can be endured, it seems there is no other way. Corresponding with those magazines will not have any results, because those in power are hard-shelled lucky people, they will not feel anything. But if it is to try the tactic of Sun Wukong entering the stomach, it can be tried for a while.

    Given your situation, a professional job is not suitable, once you stand on the "position," you will not be able to endure it. I think, write some short articles to earn some manuscript fees. Essays, book reviews, etc., about 30,000 for every thousand words. It can't be long (only 2,000 to 4,000 words per article), of course, you should also avoid too sharp things, use it as a means of livelihood, but of course, you don't have to say empty words. Shanghai, you can send it to "Building National Road South Tianyi Lane No. 5 Meilin," he is editing the "Literary Circle" (weekly) of "Wenhui Daily," maybe he will change the magazine. This person is dissatisfied with the current situation, and can leak some things through him. Beijing, you can try sending it to the "Guangming Daily" supplement. Hankou, you can send it to "Da Gang Daily" Zhang Zhuo, saying it is introduced by me. Hangzhou can send it to "Fanzi Lane Anhui Middle School Zhu Sheng (i.e., Fang Ran)," you can also say it is introduced by me. He is the chairman of the Zhejiang Writers' Association, editing the "Zhejiang Daily Literary Weekly." First, try these places.

5. February 8, 1952, Hu Feng to Lu Ling (Shanghai)
    I had the idea to send it to the local authorities here, and at the same time attach a copy of "Motherland" for performance, even thinking of sending it directly to "Xia Gong." But it is just the intention to cause trouble. Xuewei said it can be done. Let's discuss it in a few days.

    You there, it seems there will be a period of entanglement. Received a letter from Hankou, saying they saw something about you in "Communication."

    It would be best to get a copy of "Communication." Brother Yuan said, your "bare-armed combat" method, he thinks it is not good.

    So, you should discuss and study with Xie, Xu, Yan, etc., and get some inspiration. The problem is of course such a problem, but to avoid waste, you have to walk steadily, and if you grab, you have to grab accurately. If there is no guarantee, it is better to use the method of dragging.

    [Motherland] Refers to Lu Ling's script "Motherland is Moving Forward." [Xia Gong] Refers to Xia Yan. [Received a letter from Hankou] Refers to the letters from Hu Feng clique members in Hankou (such as Lü Yuan, Zhang Zhuo, etc.). ["Communication"] Refers to the "Internal Communication" of "Literary Gazette." [Xie, Xu, Yan] Refers to Xie Tao, Xu Fang, Yan Wang.

6. May 30, 1952, Hu Feng to Lü Yuan (Shanghai)
    During the rectification, the main point is to talk about leadership and check oneself, except for those in the same group, don't drag it too far. Before liberation, it was each for themselves, after liberation, it is each under the leadership doing work. Who and who are not wearing connected pants, and creative people are not professional theorists, there is no reason to be connected together. Brother Ning only talks about himself, never involving others. Out-of-province is relatively far, but it should also strive to be like this. No one can bear the responsibility of others. Brother Zhang can also be like this.

    If you have to talk, you can only talk about personal impressions, that can be talked about, because it is the opposite of what is proposed. Except for the item of not being popular, but because you are an intellectual, and a theoretical text, you did not feel it at the time. If you have to prove that the influence you received is good, then there is: willing to go to the masses for a long time to transform yourself; is it not proposed many times? As for others receiving bad influence, but that is their business, there is an opportunity to study. But it is not necessarily that I have to study. Etc.

    [During the rectification] Refers to the rectification in the literary field at that time. Hu Feng instructs Lü Yuan in this letter on how to deceive the Party and cover up the reactionary activities of Hu Feng and his clique during the rectification.

7. August 12, 1952, Hu Feng to Lü Yuan (Beijing)
    The problem is not that simple. Just now Kunyi said, he will shamelessly participate, and he can come in more than a week. This is the method of the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaign, of course, there will be a lot of bothering. He is Fengyun'er, and he will definitely be very red in Wuhan. Be as polite as possible to him, ask him more questions, see where the problem is, and especially important, will he use the method of creating trouble? Absolutely ask him politely, the more the better, it is beneficial, for learning. Of course, I also hope to get indirect benefits from you.

    [Kunyi] Refers to Zhou Yang. [Shameless] Refers to Shu Wu. Hu Feng hates Shu Wu for writing a confession of errors, calling him "shameless," but in this letter, he instructs Lü Yuan to be "as polite as possible" to Shu Wu when he passes through Wuhan, fearing that he will "create trouble," trying to get some information from him indirectly.

8. October 26, 1952, Hu Feng to Lü Yuan (Beijing)
    In your situation, you can only be honest, you should be good. "External" attacks are always like this, not hesitating to exaggerate, even saying things without substance. Because there is no "material," as seen in the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaign, it will be like this, and it will not think of making a fake tiger, making it impossible to end. Face it calmly, be honest, and it will defeat itself.

    So, (1) before liberation, you and Wuzi had a very shallow relationship, you can explain that there is no "commonality," (2) with Gu, only the relationship of submitting manuscripts, (3) with others, the relationship is very shallow or non-existent. The fact is like this, and it can only be like this. If it does not pass, just leave it like this for now. Or send the draft to me to look at.

    [Before liberation] Refers to before liberation. [Wuzi] Refers to Shu Wu. This letter was written by Hu Feng after Shu Wu published the "Open Letter to Lu Ling," instructing Lü Yuan on how to cover up his close relationship with the Hu Feng clique. And he wants him to send the draft of the "confession" to Hu Feng first to look at. [Gu] Refers to Hu Feng.

9. October 12, 1953, Hu Feng to Luo Luo, Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing)
    I think, fearing things, for oneself, this leads to surrender and sacrificing others, but for climbing up, it seems it will not be so. So, it seems it should be striven for in a positive sense, necessary struggle must be done, but it is also for striving. As much as possible to approach, persuade, and if necessary, expose, but it is also for striving. Strive to do some work, give advice, patiently "help" him, it is also for striving. From the current situation, of course, it cannot be trusted, but it also cannot be completely untrusted.

    [Fear things, for oneself] Here, it refers to Wang Yuanhua, who was once a member of the Hu Feng clique. After Wang Yuanhua confessed his erroneous thoughts, Hu Feng directed two other members of the Hu Feng clique, Luo Luo and Zhang Zhongxiao, to surround him, "striving" for him to continue serving the Hu Feng clique. "He" refers to Wang Yuanhua.

**Third Category: Hu Feng and His Reactionary Clique Using Conspiracy Tactics, Establishing Activity Bases, and Striving to Expand Their Influence**

1. November 18, 1951, Hu Feng to Lü Yuan (Beijing)
    I wrote a long poem of more than five hundred lines, maybe it can be published in a few days. If there are no side effects, you can tell your superiors that the author is willing to have you reprint it, even without manuscript fees.

    [Your superiors] Refers to the person in charge of "Changjiang Daily" in Hankou, at that time Lü Yuan was in the "Changjiang Daily" office. Hu Feng orders Lü Yuan to find a place to reprint his "poem," expanding their influence.

2. November 29, 1951, Hu Feng to Lu Ling (Beijing)
    Jin Shan came yesterday. He is the deputy director of the Youth Theater, and Liao Chengzhi is the director. He hopes you will come to the Youth Theater, unrestricted, and the script will be premiered by them. Living expenses are taken care of, family members are also taken care of, or find suitable work. If you go to a factory or somewhere else, they will also help as much as possible. Their shoulders are big.

    I think this is a suitable place.

    It is really tiring to entangle with the little rats outside, it is better to come here.

3. 195X, Hu Feng to Geng Yong (Beijing)
    Regarding the publication issue: 1. It seems not suitable to strive for publication in New Literature. The position of New Literature should be preserved, if it comes out, it may be taboo, and suffer from "organizational" interference. 2. If it comes out from Earth, there will be circulation problems, and it may make it more taboo, until it dies. If it cannot be published, then it can only come out from Earth. 3. It is best to find another publisher. If Jia finds the Cultural Work Society, etc., it should be tried. The remuneration is not calculated, it can be free. 4. Time. If it is settled, it can be published, it seems there is no need to wait. There will not be a "good" opportunity in the near future. The effect of printing is: (1) in some circles, it will suppress their arrogance, making them know that the world is not easy to "peace," (2) it will stimulate them to become more crazy. But now they are already crazy, even if they become a little more crazy, it doesn't matter. Both effects will be achieved.

    [Regarding the publication issue] Refers to the publication issue of Geng Yong's "Research on the True Story of Ah Q." [New Literature] Refers to New Literature Publishing House. [Earth] Refers to Earth Society. [Jia] Refers to Jia Zhifang.

4. March 4, 1952, Hu Feng to Lu Ling (Shanghai)
    The East China region is in chaos, Shanghai is also like this. Now, Peng Boshan has been transferred to take over the work of Huang Yuan, the deputy minister, which shows that it is urgent. But if Peng Boshan cannot open up a position, it can only be a matter of cleaning up the previous person's dirty toilet. He will report for duty and take over the job the day after tomorrow, probably in one or two months, the situation can be seen.

    [Deputy Minister] Refers to the former deputy minister of the Cultural Department of the East China Military and Political Commission. One of the members of the Hu Feng clique, Peng Boshan, took over this job, and Hu Feng had great "hopes" for "opening up a position."

5. May 9, 1952, Hu Feng to Lu Ling (Shanghai)
    Struggle cannot be obtained without blood. A lot of blood has been shed, but in the future, it can be learned to use some tactics, try to shed less, and be willing to stay in the bad air hole for a longer time, "preserving strength." The situation is like this. I think, the article can be written, strive to go to Beijing once, if necessary, it can only be done in East China for one or two years. This matter should be discussed with Brothers Xie and Xu, but do not tell others. What do you think?

    [Xie, Xu] Refers to Xie Tao and Xu Fang.

6. May 29, 1952, Hu Feng to Lu Ling (Shanghai)
    Here, it is proposed that the East China Theater (three troupes of drama, song, and symphony, totaling more than 200 people), or there may be a magazine. The advantage is: an independent unit, contact with the masses. Going to Beijing, no matter what, there will not be such a job opportunity. But there are many difficulties: (1) not in Beijing, always in a state of being close but not close, (2) the scope of contact cannot be large, it is limited, (3) Xia manages literature (deputy minister), (4) Peng and Xue's shoulders are only that big, Peng can hold up in East China, but he cannot retort at the top.

    It is such a situation. I think, the article can be written, strive to go to Beijing once, if necessary, it can only be done in East China for one or two years. This matter should be discussed with Brothers Xie and Xu, but do not tell others. What do you think?

    [Xia] Refers to Xia Yan. [Peng, Xue] Refers to Peng Boshan and Xuewei.

7. May 29, 1952, Hu Feng to Lu Ling (Shanghai)
    The novel was sent for copying, the title was changed, but strangely, it was returned by that newspaper, with a letter saying the main characters are quite good, but the characters (especially the military representative) are written in a strange way, influenced by a bad writing method, advising the author to deepen the struggle, etc. Obviously, the nobleman does not forget, it is seen. The bad thing is, seeing this method, it will be more careful in the future. From this, the depth of hatred can be seen.

    [Novel] Refers to a novel by Lu Ling. [That newspaper] Refers to one of our newspapers. Hu Feng uses the method of "changing the appearance" to send the works with erroneous thoughts of his clique to magazines. [Certain person] Refers to Lu Ling.

**Fourth Category: Hu Feng Sends His Clique Members to Infiltrate the Party, Steal Documents, and Gather Information**

    Brother Dian heard from the minister that the time for discussing my problem is ripe, Peng Boshan asked after coming, so, maybe it can be played?

Title: The Reactionary Conspiracy of the Hu Feng Group
Author:
Date: 1955-04-14
Page: 1

The People's Daily has received a letter from a reader, who mentioned that he had recently met with Yu Gang and discussed some issues. The letter did not provide the details of the conversation. The reader requested that we inform him of the content of the conversation, including Yu Gang's words, my words, my impressions, and the concluding remarks. The letter also mentioned that Yu Gang's conversation could be seen as a reflection of a certain kind of situation.

I sent a letter on May 4th, which could have been received by May 7th. The letter might have been passed through Yu Gang's hands, so he might have heard about the vice-chairman's words. If Yu Gang and I met after May 7th, it is likely that he had a specific purpose for the meeting. Therefore, my opinions would have had an impact on him.

If you have the opportunity to see Yu Gang again, you can hint at the following points: first, that you have been thinking about work for several years; second, that you want to move to Beijing but have not received any help. Of course, you should not actively seek him out to discuss these matters.

[Vice-chairman] refers to Premier Zhou Enlai. Here, Hu Feng instructs his group member, Xie Tao, to probe the situation at Yu Gang's place and engage in activities beneficial to the Hu Feng group. Third, how Hu Feng instructs his reactionary group members to launch a ferocious attack on the Party and the Party-led literary front, and after the attack fails, how he arranges for retreat, self-protection, and awaits the opportunity.

Hu Feng instructs his reactionary group members to use despicable and shameless methods to attack the "Literary Gazette," aiming to prevent criticism of Hu Feng. Fourth, on August 13, 1950, Hu Feng wrote to Zhang Zhongxiao (Shanghai): "Now, under one cover, many readers are in a drowsy state. First, public opinion is uniform, and even an ordinary reader finds it difficult to judge. Second, the absolute majority of readers are involved in some organizational life, where the atmosphere is coercive. Third, literary issues are indeed the most labor-saving with mechanical materialism. However, despite this, there is resistance everywhere, and there is a demand for further progress. Therefore, those who guide, on the one hand, feel the pressure is very heavy, on the other hand, feel that they must continue to suppress. How it will turn out, in half a year, it is not known whether some clues can be seen? But the important thing is to let the readers speak, even if they are suppressed, they still have to speak. Gradually, see if some breaches can be broken through. Currently, there are only monopolistic publications, if not broken through, it will be suffocated to death."

The "Gazette" refers to the "Literary Gazette." The "Minister" refers to Comrade Zhou Yang. "Time" refers to Hu Feng's poem "Time Begins." The "Literary Gazette" in its first volume, issue 12, and second volume, issue 4, had some articles criticizing it. Hu Feng's so-called "protests" here are all instigated by his counterrevolutionary group members. Under his instigation, Zhang Zhongxiao, Geng Yong, and others, using dozens of different names, wrote letters to the editorial department of the "Literary Gazette," madly abusing those who criticized Hu Feng as "maggots," "lowly mosquitoes," "shrews," etc., and using vulgar, hooligan language wrote: "Whoever says nonsense again, I will f*** his ancestors eighteen generations!" They even fabricated the minutes of a fake symposium with dozens of people, sent it to the "Literary Gazette," threatening the publication not to publish any more criticism of Hu Feng. "Poet Sha" refers to Comrade Sha Yu. In the "Discussion on the Tendency of Poetry" in the "Literary Gazette," volume 1, issue 12, he criticized Hu Feng's "Requiem" ("Time Begins" contains a poem).

On August 24, 1950, Hu Feng wrote to Geng Yong: "Returning and resending it to make them difficult is good. But it is not known whether the name was changed last time? It is best to change the name. However, if it was not changed last time, it is not good to change it in the middle. Again, the article should be expanded with analysis and explanation, on the one hand, they have low ability outside the clique, but the main thing is to be convincing to the readers, although 99% will not be published. "Light of the People" is still the segment of Sha Yu's "criticism," while "Mass Poetry" is a complete negation, completely exposing Huang Yuelan himself. ... After they reply, you can send the letter to me, and with the tone of the first correspondence, write a letter to me, raising your opinions on them. In two or three months, it may be in Beijing, then it can be used as material to criticize them. This kind of material has already been sent from a few places. ... ... ...

I think your writing style should be improved, with a sudden thrust, it is absolutely not acceptable now. Of course, sharpness cannot be lost, but it should be embedded in analysis and explanation, and be vigilant about the "attitude" issue, now the target is not the "enemy," but all "leaders"! Again, you should read more Marxism-Leninism and Soviet literary theory criticism, for the "words" to stand on the "position," if not careful, others will use this to kill you. ... ... ...

If there are like-minded friends, you can organize a small symposium or the like, now this kind of work is needed, and it still needs to start from a few people.

[Make them difficult] refers to the editorial department of the "Literary Gazette." [Light of the People ...] The "Light of the People" also published an article criticizing Hu Feng's poetry. [Sha Yu's segment] refers to the short article by Comrade Sha Yu in the "Literary Gazette," volume 1, issue 12, which quoted a segment from Hu Feng's "Requiem." [Mass Poetry ...] "Mass Poetry" published an article by Comrade Huang Yuelan criticizing Hu Feng's poetry. [Be vigilant about the "attitude" issue ...] In this letter, Hu Feng instructs his group members not to openly use the attitude of dealing with "enemies" to oppose the Party and the Party-led literary circle, so as not to expose their true colors.

On September 14, 1950, Hu Feng wrote to Zhang Zhongxiao (Shanghai): "Regarding that 'Gazette,' it is still necessary to stick to it, because there is no other battlefield. To wear it down, to break through it, it is necessary to stick to it. But I think it is not necessary to use letters all the time, some can be sent in the form of articles, but of course, they should be written carefully, based on the attitude of seeking truth. Or first discuss it among you, or even send it with the names of the participants (those who agree), this is a war, and also a tempering. Regarding 'Time,' if possible, do it this way. Because this incident has become the center, it may become the spark. Now doing it this way, they will not publish it 99%, but it becomes a psychological war, making them uneasy. When there is more material, or I myself come out, then they cannot help but publish it. Regarding Shi and Chen, it can also be done this way. They want you to write articles, don't they?"

[That "Gazette"] refers to the "Literary Gazette." ["Time"] refers to Hu Feng's poem "Time Begins." [Shi and Chen] refers to Comrades Shi Du and Chen Yong, who published an article criticizing A Meng in the "People's Daily" in March 1950.

Second, Hu Feng instructs Lu Ling to use deceitful methods to deceive the leading comrades and cover up the true colors of the Hu Feng group.

On May 31, 1950, Hu Feng wrote to Lu Ling (Shanghai): "Regarding the meeting, consider the situation. The main thing is to see if the blockade on the play can be relaxed a bit. First, look at the situation, second, inform Xiao first, see his expression, third, the shorter the time, the better, give them a flickering thing, don't talk about literature, talk less about literature, talk about factories and the like. If asked about the Mei incident, it seems better to avoid it, for example, I haven't looked at it carefully, I think there are many problems and so on. ... ... ...

[The meeting] refers to the meeting that Comrade Zhou Yang planned to have with Lu Ling. [Xiao] refers to Comrade Xiao Jingguang. [Mei] refers to A Meng, and the "Mei incident" refers to the article published in the "People's Daily" criticizing A Meng.

On August 29, 1950, Hu Feng wrote to Lu Ling (Shanghai): "... It is necessary to strive for a rehearsal of the play, and secondly, to complete the English play as soon as possible, first show it to Xiao alone, and ask him to answer only one question: whether it is politically established? If it is confirmed, then hand it over to the theater, and request a quick decision, proposing not to drag it out like last time, using a soft knife to slowly cut. It is necessary to reject unreasonable revision opinions. In my opinion, they have a great possibility of using the English play as a turning point for the play, so proposing it early may suffocate the play. ... ...

The situation is serious, their 'desertification' method may continue for a period of time. The mission of the two plays is too great."

[The play] refers to Lu Ling's play "Long Live the People." [The English play] refers to Lu Ling's play "Heroic Mother." [Xiao] refers to Comrade Xiao Jingguang.

On June 13, 1952, Hu Feng wrote to Lu Ling (Shanghai): "The Ministry is coming to lead, it is necessary to prepare well. I think the small group's conclusion will not be brought out, and the Ministry will redo it. But regarding the shamelessness, you must speak out. Of course, expose him. And that article, it is not taken as a confirmed opinion, but as a discussion (you heard it that way at the time), and at that time, no one completely agreed with him. Expose his desire to be a professor; during the Liu-Deng Army, he did not participate, and everyone was dissatisfied with him afterwards; after liberation, he advised him to stay in Nanning, but he always wanted to come out, to climb up; when he came to Beijing, he spoke with cold ridicule, and everyone disliked him. ... ...

Regarding the small group: it is not known. There have always been individual submissions, and many were not used. There has never been a meeting. ... ...

So, on your side, it may be a hard push. Maybe they will try to attack with the shamelessness mentioned. First, we have been together. But I have always been dissatisfied with his bookishness and emptiness (calling him a remnant of the May Fourth Movement), and there have been many arguments, and no one has ever said A, B, C, it is probably only he who thinks so. Second, the dislike of Marxism-Leninism and so on, it is completely the opposite. He always boasted about talking about Marxism-Leninism, and he was also reading some Marxism-Leninism, and he was in the process of thinking that he had entered the door of using Marxism-Leninism to understand society, and he was quite intoxicated. ... ...

Fourth, he always wanted to do literary criticism and the like, thinking that his philosophy could be applied very "deeply," and he thought he did not understand real struggle, nor did he understand literature, and he advised him not to do it, and there were arguments. A, B, C, it is probably his idea. At that time, we studied the speech, so we were determined to write about the laboring people. Fifth, no correspondence after liberation. When meeting, he wanted to come to Beijing. But it can be seen that he had a cold ridicule attitude, a petty bourgeois mentality. Etc., you consider again, make preparations. In short, this should be taken "seriously."

[The Ministry] refers to the Ministry of Culture. At that time, the China Youth Art Theater, where Lu Ling was, decided to be under the leadership of the Ministry of Culture. [Shameless] refers to Shu Wu, who had criticized his mistakes. Hu Feng wrote this letter after the "People's Daily" reprinted Shu Wu's self-criticism "Learning 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' from the Beginning." He instructed Lu Ling on how to cover up the true colors of the Hu Feng reactionary group. [A, B, C] In the above self-criticism, Shu Wu exposed that the Hu Feng group members slandered Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as just "Marxism-Leninism A, B, C." [Speech] refers to Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

On June 26, 1952, Hu Feng wrote to Lu Ling (Shanghai): "First, Kun Yi, whether hard or soft, it is better to take a soft but firm attitude to deal with him. Seek truth from facts, do not attack arbitrarily, nor retreat arbitrarily. This is an important issue. Make him feel that he can be used but not deceived. Second, three methods: 1, stick to the 'Gazette' first; 2, take it up; 3, write it quickly, but put it aside for a while and see. This depends on the actual situation. Maybe try it out in the small group, how to deal with the 'Gazette'? In short, preparations must be made."

[Kun Yi] refers to Comrade Zhou Yang. [That "Gazette"] refers to the "Literary Gazette." Third, Hu Feng mobilizes the forces of his reactionary group to prepare for a ferocious attack on the Party.

On March 26, 1954, Hu Feng wrote to Luo Luo and Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing): "Since your publishing house was established, which bad books have been published, why were they published, which good books have been published, what difficulties and setbacks were encountered before and after publication. A simple list should be sent to me."

[Your publishing house] refers to the Shanghai New Literature Publishing House. Hu Feng's followers Luo Luo, Zhang Zhongxiao, Geng Yong, etc., all infiltrated the publishing house through Liu Xuewei's connections. This letter is Hu Feng instructing Luo and Zhang to collect internal materials from the publishing house.

On April 5, 1954, Hu Feng wrote to Luo Luo, Zhang Zhongxiao, Geng Yong, and others (Beijing): "You are busy with work, but if there is any possibility, I hope you can start to help me with a task. Analyze the arguments and points of two articles: 1, find out the points they used; 2, for each of their arguments, write out your opinions (based on the conditions at that time and the main theme of the original text); 3, provide reference materials (Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, current Soviet theory), arguments, sources, page numbers; 4, use the "theories" of He, Hong Kong, and other articles ... etc., the same and erroneous ones that can be compared - sources and page numbers. This preparation must be made now, seek truth from facts to help me prepare, so as not to be unprepared. I may have to do this work as soon as I settle down. [Two articles] refer to the articles by Lin Mo Han and He Qi Fang criticizing Hu Feng published in 1953.

On April 19, 1954, Hu Feng wrote to Xie Tao (Beijing): "Last night, I started working on 'national form,' and it is going smoothly. This involves Lenin's two kinds of cultural theory. Lenin talked about 'bourgeois national,' or modern states, and Stalin's 'national' category is also defined in this way. But I can't remember the direct source of Lenin's words. If convenient, please help me find it, copy two or three sentences for me. 1, the original text, 2, the source. It would be better if it could be a direct quotation."

[National form] refers to the part about "national form" in the report Hu Feng made to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. To write this report to attack the Party, many members of the Hu Feng group secretly participated in this activity. Hu Feng had given the outline of his report to the key members of the Hu Feng group in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places, for discussion.

On July 26, 1954, Hu Feng wrote to Luo Luo and Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing): "Ou Yang is still here. He will probably return to Nanjing in about a week. If he does not go to Shanghai on official business, then you send someone to Nanjing once. He knows the whole content, and after you understand it, you can make preparations in advance. When the struggle is launched, it is hoped that it can be thorough. He himself, while waiting for official business, has also been preparing an article in these days, reviewing the process of criticism of Ning brother, and exposing the conspiracy. Now, three tasks can be done: (1) Since liberation, while criticizing Ning brother, what has been affirmed? After checking, if it is useful, make a simple and principled analysis, as an explanation of the sectarianism to continue the rule of vulgar sociology. (2) In the works edited by Er Ma, check the work attitude and intention. Also make a simple and principled analysis, prepare for Er Ma. (3) Check what should not have been published and what should have been published since the New Literature. Prepare, if necessary, to report to the higher authorities, explaining the harm of sectarian rule. You consider, if you think it can be done, start preparing now, and make a decision after talking with Ou Yang. After seeing Ou Yang, see if you can go to see Sheng brother, tell him the situation, and hope he can also prepare. This matter must not give any hint to anyone. [Ou Yang] refers to Ou Yang Zhuang, a member of the Hu Feng group. This letter is Hu Feng's strategy after proposing his report to attack the Party, mobilizing his counterrevolutionary group members to actively cooperate. [Er Ma] refers to Comrade Feng Xuefeng. [New Literature] refers to the New Literature Publishing House. [Sheng brother] refers to Fang Ran, also known as Zhu Sheng, in Hangzhou.

Fourth, Hu Feng's arrangements during the ferocious attack.

On October 27, 1954, Hu Feng wrote to Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing): "The situation here is already in turmoil. First, the party group of the Writers' Association has been in meetings for several days, probably self-criticism by the gentlemen themselves, reporting, and the Central Committee will consider the problem again. There must be many interesting things inside. Today, it is even said that a 200,000-word document will be published, if it is true, it is probably that the higher authorities have decided to consider it thoroughly. Second, today's newspaper published an article by Yuan Shi attacking the 'Literary Gazette,' which is a very unusual phenomenon. It can be considered that on the one hand, it is to sacrifice the 'Literary Gazette' and shift the main responsibility to the 'Literary Gazette,' and on the other hand, some people like Yuan Shi are quickly taking a stand, wanting to seize the opportunity to attack the iron wall. Third, the important speeches at the Federation of Literary and Art Circles will also be published, which may be to promote the development of the struggle on the higher authorities' side, and may be to create a reformist situation for the gentlemen. In this situation, the incidents that have occurred in your publishing house in the past few months are of great significance. These facts can strongly prove what the essence of the problem is, and it cannot be escaped. That letter has been added with such a beginning and end, you study it, especially the latter part, if it is consistent with the actual situation, what can be added can be added, the language and expressions should also be considered from the convenience of your struggle, and the viewpoint should be considered. After consideration, a complete copy should be sent to me."

[The situation here] refers to the situation after the movement to criticize the bourgeois idealism of Hu Shi and others was launched. [200,000-word document] refers to the report Hu Feng wrote to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. [Yuan Shi] refers to Comrade Yuan Shuipai. [That letter] refers to the article prepared by the Hu Feng group to attack the Party's leadership in the literary field.

On November 2, 1954, Hu Feng wrote to Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing): "The breach has been opened, and it is very tense. This is just a breach that has been seized, and the problem needs to be fully opened. It has been publicly raised. Er Ma and the 'Gazette' have taken the lead in self-criticism and in-depth self-examination, which is quite interesting! The first step of self-criticism will be published, and it is not limited to the 'Red Chamber' incident. Of course, the 'poet' has benefited, but he will not escape either. ... ... It is necessary to proceed calmly. Xing brother's article should be hurried up. If possible, you should also write an article."

[Breach] refers to the joint enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers' Association, which examined the mistakes of the "Literary Gazette." [Poet] refers to Comrade Yuan Shuipai. Hu Feng indeed launched an attack on the "People's Daily" and Comrade Yuan Shuipai at the enlarged meeting. [Xing brother] refers to Hu Feng's follower Xi Heng. Hu Feng urged Xi Heng and Zhang Zhongxiao to write articles to support his attack.

On November 7, 1954, Hu Feng wrote to Fang Ran and Xi Heng (Beijing): "The struggle here has been launched, and today is the second session of the enlarged meeting of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. I made a speech. The problem of the 'Gazette' is not isolated, it is a manifestation of the leadership tendency: using examples to illustrate that the direction has been established since the first and second volumes: in terms of stance, it is to surrender to the bourgeoisie and hate young writers and revolutionary writers who disagree with them; in terms of theory, it is to view content with vulgar sociology and view form with formalism. In the past five years, it has been dragged down. - The meeting has been dragged from the 'Gazette' to the overall situation. My speech is not finished. Next time, Xu brother will make a speech to raise accusations. Originally, I also wanted you to check the materials, but now I hope you can write this article well. It is necessary to step by step grasp the revelation that this is a sectarian persecution, and sharply point out that their 'theory' is bourgeois. [The 'Gazette'] refers to the 'Literary Gazette.' [Xu brother] refers to Lu Ling."

On November 14, 1954, Hu Feng wrote to Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing): "The struggle is unfolding. Huang's speech has drawn out the essence of the 'Gazette,' and from the first and second volumes to today, it is consistent. The characteristics are: the theoretical weapon is vulgar sociology, and one of its manifestations in aesthetics is formalism (Yuan Shuipai's surrender to Yu Pingbo), therefore, it surrenders to the bourgeoisie (Yuan Shuipai's surrender to Yu Pingbo), and on the other hand, it attacks the new forces (small figures), and does not allow the small figures to fight with Marxism-Leninism 'common sense' (such as A Meng). It collects a group of readers who are suppressed by any different opinions, collects a group of naive believers and flatterers around, creates an 'internal bulletin,' attacks those who need to be attacked, and creates an independent kingdom. This reveals the characteristics of sectarian rule, and they must admit it. - It has exposed Yuan 'poet' and A Meng's oppression, and Er Ma's self-criticism has not touched the problem. Xu's speech has exposed the historical situation and this time's attack is planned, with Zi Zhou as the main planner, Feng Jie and Shuang Mu and others are all conspirators; it has raised the issue of sectarianism and warlord rule. (It has been proposed to publish his response.) - The reaction after the meeting is good, it has shaken people; generally, it is tacitly acknowledged that sectarianism is a fact. In this way, it has disrupted their 'schedule' (wanting the problem not to be expanded). The struggle has officially begun. Xu's article, about 40,000 words, will be thrown out soon."

[Huang's speech] refers to Hu Feng's speech at the joint enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers' Association (published in the "Literary Gazette," issue 22, 1954). [The 'Gazette'] refers to the 'Literary Gazette.' [Xu] refers to Lu Ling. [Zi Zhou] refers to Comrade Zhou Yang. [Feng Jie and Shuang Mu] "Feng Jie" refers to Comrade Ding Ling. "Shuang Mu" refers to Comrade Lin Mo Han.

On November 14, 1954, Hu Feng wrote to Fang Ran (Beijing): "Here, three meetings have been held to discuss the 'Gazette.' In the second and third meetings, Huang Pangzi made a three-hour speech. From the first and second volumes, the error to today is consistent. The characteristics are: the theoretical weapon is vulgar sociology, and one of its manifestations in aesthetics is formalism, surrender to the bourgeoisie (Yuan Shuipai's surrender to Yu Pingbo); therefore, on the one hand, it surrenders to the bourgeoisie (Cai Yi, the editors' surrender to Zhu Guangqian's challenge), and on the other hand, it attacks the new forces (small figures) (regarding A Meng). Fundamentally, the attitude towards Marxism-Leninism is: on the one hand, it gives it to the bourgeoisie (Zhu, Yu), and on the other hand, it does not allow the small figures, revolutionary writers to use it as a weapon for struggle (from A Meng to Li, Lan). Its 'mass base' is: it suppresses any different opinions, collects a group of naive believers and flatterers around, creates an 'internal bulletin,' attacks those who need to be attacked, and creates an independent kingdom. In this way, it draws out the characteristics of sectarian rule, and they must admit it. - It has exposed Yuan 'poet' and A Meng's oppression, and Er Ma's self-criticism has not touched the problem. In the third meeting, Xu made a two-hour speech, exposing the historical situation and this time's attack is planned, with Zi Zhou as the main planner, Feng Jie and Shuang Mu and others are all conspirators; it has raised the issue of sectarianism and warlord rule. (It has been proposed to publish his response.) - The reaction after the meeting is good, it has shaken people; generally, it is tacitly acknowledged that sectarianism is a fact. In this way, it has disrupted their 'schedule' (wanting the problem not to be expanded). The struggle has officially begun. Xu's article, about 40,000 words, will be thrown out soon."

[The 'Gazette'] refers to the 'Literary Gazette.' [Huang Pangzi] refers to Hu Feng himself. [Xu] refers to Lu Ling. [Zi Zhou] refers to Comrade Zhou Yang. [Feng Jie and Shuang Mu] "Feng Jie" refers to Comrade Ding Ling. "Shuang Mu" refers to Comrade Lin Mo Han.

On November 25, 1954, Hu Feng wrote to Fang Ran (Beijing): "Sending a letter to Yu is of course good, it should be like this. But pay attention to two new situations: first, Yu is on vacation, it may fall into the hands of Shuang Mu. The first-level propaganda department, the old comrades are in charge, and other individuals have opposing factors in their emotions, and they do not understand the core, so it cannot solve the problem. ... ... Second, they will also use the shamelessness to entangle you. They still want to use shamelessness to save their lives, and they also went to the counterattack meeting, and he was very gloomy, probably preparing to come out and bite a few times."

[Sending a letter to Yu] refers to Fang Ran's letter to Comrade Lu Dingyi, which completely defended Hu Feng. [Shuang Mu] refers to Comrade Lin Mo Han. [The first-level propaganda department] refers to the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. [The counterattack meeting] refers to the sixth enlarged meeting of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Writers' Association, where some comrades refuted Hu Feng's erroneous speech.

Fifth, Hu Feng's arrangements for his reactionary group to retreat and cover up after the attack failed, waiting for the opportunity to return.

On December 13, 1954, Hu Feng wrote to Fang Ran (Beijing): "The articles have all come out, and it is estimated that you have seen them. This matter must have caused a lot of waste. ... ... Blindly optimistic, finally rushed forward, without concrete analysis of concrete situations, the responsibility is mainly mine. ... ... I am ashamed of the fighters. If time permits, come to play once, the travel expenses will be arranged here, how about it?"

[The articles] refer to his speech at the enlarged meeting of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Writers' Association attacking the Party and Comrade Zhou Yang's speech criticizing him, such as "We Must Fight."

On January 20, 1955, Hu Feng wrote to Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing): "I hope you will read it extremely calmly, see what it criticizes, what it cannot touch, whether there is any exaggeration. ... ... I wrote the 'self-criticism' based on what I can understand now. If it can be published, this will be the first step to relieve my burden. As for the friends who have friendship with me, that is another matter, it should be seen from each person's labor."

[It] refers to Hu Feng's so-called "self-criticism." In this letter, Hu Feng informed Zhang Zhongxiao of the key points of his fake self-criticism (omitted due to space limitations), and on the same day, he also wrote a letter to Fang Ran with the same content. It is noteworthy that the sentence "what it cannot touch."

On January 24, 1955, Hu Feng wrote to Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing): "Being able to work calmly is very good. In the past few days, there was a letter, and the situation can be known from there. Now it is no longer a matter of being passive or not, you should be able to calmly and calmly study the problem. The situation mentioned in the previous letter, before the article is published, it is not necessary to explicitly say it, but for those who have opinions, do not write letters or articles anymore. Now it is not the time to discuss, but to 'criticize.' [Before the article is published] Here, the 'article' refers to Hu Feng's so-called 'self-criticism.' This letter and the following few are Hu Feng's instructions to his counterrevolutionary group members to stop the attack unanimously and how to cover up after the criticism of his movement began.

On January 24, 1955, Hu Feng wrote to Feng Yi (Beijing): "I hope you will calmly and calmly treat the things that have happened and are about to happen. ... ... Again, I say, hope you will calmly treat the things that are about to happen. Next, study well by yourself, do not write letters or articles or express immature opinions. This is the most important thing."

On January 26, 1955, Hu Feng wrote to Jia Zhifang and Ren Min (Beijing): "It has been a long time since we last corresponded, I wonder if you are well? The problem has new developments, I hope you will treat the things that have happened and are about to happen with an extremely calm and calm attitude, and do not act rashly, participate in discussions, this will only make the problem more difficult to handle, and there are enthusiastic people, I also hope you will stop them. Do not write articles or letters to express your opinions, now it is no longer 'discussion,' but 'criticism.' You are a teacher, it is better not to participate if possible, if it is unavoidable, you can say a little of your opinion in the place of criticism."

On February 2, 1955, Hu Feng wrote to Fang Ran (Beijing): "... Therefore, I thought of you, if the higher authorities have not yet expressed anything, you should also prepare yourself, first check your erroneous articles, such as the 'Explanation of the Battle Requirement,' 'Explanation of the Process,' the inappropriate parts of the content, and the articles published such as 'Escape from the Collective,' and then criticize Hu something, and you can declare that you have not been involved in literature for many years, only occasionally writing some writer research, but always feel that there is a problem, and have not been able to face it. How to do it, you naturally know better than me. Xing brother is engaged in creation, he can use 'not understanding' to respond, and does not express any opinion, but if he sees the error, he should still express it."

["Explanation of the Battle Requirement" and "Explanation of the Process"] are the articles Fang Ran wrote to propagate reactionary thoughts, published in "Hope." [Hu something] refers to Hu Feng himself. [Xing brother] refers to Xi Heng.

On February 8, 1955, Hu Feng wrote to Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing): "Do not be sad, be extremely calm. There are still many things we have to endure, and we can only seek rebirth in endurance, everything is for the cause, for a greater future! So in the future meeting, do not be rigid, it should be based on Hu and others' erroneous speeches. If Pu brother is organized to express, he can write an article, this is nothing, after all, how much is wrong? How much is right? In the hearts of the people, there is a count."

[Hu and others] refers to Hu Feng and others. [Pu brother] also refers to Hu Feng himself.

On February 13, 1955, Hu Feng wrote to Zhang Zhongxiao (Beijing): "Pu brother should take a clear critical attitude, do not be passive, if it is unavoidable, you can also write a short article on general issues, you should also do the same. Other acquaintances, you can convey this intention to them."

[Pu brother] refers to Hu Feng himself.

On February 13, 1955, Hu Feng wrote to Fang Ran (Beijing): "For the Xiang incident, it is good to face your own works, but at the same time, you should declare your attitude, such as having a close relationship in the past, but not caring about theoretical issues, you can't say you are influenced, after liberation, you have been educated by the Party, and you have only seen him once, and you have rarely corresponded, etc., next, if you talk about meetings and the like, you should take a clear critical attitude on issues such as stance, and next, if it is unavoidable, you can also write a short article on general issues, of course, it is said on the level of views, do not be passive at all. ... ... Your matter is not in the circle, but in the conversation of Cao Jun, it seems to be very important, it is estimated that it will not be ignored. First, express your attitude to the direct leadership, it should be necessary, and you should also make further preparations. Here, the short articles in '呼刊' and '希刊' are very concerned. They have been printed as materials."

[For Xiang] refers to the Hu Feng group member Xi Heng. [And he has only seen him once] "He" refers to Hu Feng himself. ["呼刊" and "希刊"] refers to the Hu Feng group's publications "呼吸" and "希望."

From the above materials, we can see: (1) Since liberation, the counterrevolutionary and anti-people conspiracies of the Hu Feng group have become more organized and expanded, and their attacks on the Party and the Party-led literary front have become more ferocious; (2) Like all counterrevolutionary groups, their sabotage activities are always carried out in a covert or two-faced manner; (3) Due to the exposure of their conspiracies, the Hu Feng group has to be forced to retreat from the attack, but this reactionary group, which hates the Party, hates the people, and hates the revolution to the point of madness, is not truly laying down their arms, but is trying to continue to use the two-faced method to preserve their "strength," waiting for the opportunity to return.

Hu Feng uses words like "seeking rebirth in endurance" and "everything is for the cause, for a greater future" to encourage his group members, which is a clear evidence. The counterrevolutionary Hu Feng group members, like other open or hidden counterrevolutionaries, they place their hopes on the restoration of the counterrevolutionary regime and the collapse of the people's revolutionary regime. They believe that this is the "opportunity" they are waiting for.

From the fact of the Hu Feng group's conspiracy activities, we must draw sufficient lessons, and in various work departments, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance, be good at distinguishing those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose the revolution, and clean them out of our various fronts, so as to defend the great victories we have already won and will win.

### 关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料

第2版()
专栏：

    关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料
    编者按：自从舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”发表以后，人们被胡风反党反人民反革命的罪恶所激怒了。本报已经收到全国各地各界读者写的大批文章和信件，他们一致要求彻底揭露胡风及其集团的罪恶，这种愤怒的情绪是不可抑止的。但是，有些同情胡风、或者口头上反对胡风但内心是同情胡风的人们在说，那些材料大都是解放以前的，不能据此定罪。那末，好罢，现在请看第二批材料。
    现在发表的材料，是从胡风写给他的反动集团的人们的六十八封密信中摘录下来的。这些密信都是胡风在全国解放以后写的。在这些信里，胡风恶毒地污蔑党、污蔑党的文艺方针、污蔑党的负责同志、咒骂文艺界的党员作家和党外作家；在这些信里，胡风指挥他的反动集团的人们进行反党、反人民的罪恶活动，秘密地有计划地组织他们向党和党所领导的文艺战线猖狂进攻；在这些信里，胡风唆使他的党羽们打进党内，打进革命团体内建立据点，扩充“实力”，探听情况和盗窃党内文件。在这些信里，人们可以清楚地看出，在解放以后，胡风更加施展了他的两面派手法：公开的是“不要去碰”，“可能的地方还要顺着”党和人民；而暗中却更加紧地“磨我的剑，窥测方向”，“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，来进行反革命的活动。当他向党举行猖狂的进攻失败以后，他就赶紧指挥他的党羽布置退却，“在忍受中求得重生”，准备好每人一套假检讨，以便潜伏下来，伺机再起。这就证明了胡风及其集团的反革命阴谋的极端严重性。我们必须加倍提高警惕，决不可中了他们假投降的诡计。
    胡风和胡风集团分子的通信，大部分采取了鬼鬼祟祟的、隐蔽的方法。胡风和他们相约，在信中使用了各种代号和隐语，信上提到党的负责同志、文艺界负责同志和党员作家，都用了代号。收信人的名字和胡风自己的署名也很不一致，信封上的名字往往是收信人的妻子或其他人；信末的署名也经常变化或不署名。胡风的许多信用的是“人民日报”“解放日报”的信封信纸，许多信封上写的是“上海新文艺出版社罗寄”“上海青年报罗寄”“北京中央戏剧学院张寄”或其他机关名称。
    下面就是从这些密信中摘录出来的材料，按内容分为三类，每类大致按写信的时间先后排列，并加必要的注释。信中旁点都是原有的。
    第一胡风对党和党的领导、对毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”、对文艺界的污蔑和攻击
    一、一九四九年五月三十日胡风给路翎信（北京）
    文艺这领域，笼罩着绝大的苦闷。许多人等于带上了枷，但健康的愿望普遍存在。小媳妇一样，经常怕挨打的存在着。……
    〔带上了枷〕一九四九年五月，在全国胜利即将到来的时候，人们都是欢欣鼓舞的。但胡风由香港经东北初到北京，立即诅咒新中国的文艺领域“笼罩着绝大的苦闷”“带上了枷”。
    二、一九五○年一月十二日胡风给路翎信（北京）
    ……我们会胜利，但那过程并不简单罢。我想，还得更沉着，更用力，以五年为期并不算悲观的。小刊，要弄得好点才是。并不能把它当作什么阵地，但我们是，咳一声都有人来录音检查的。——稿子寄天津去。
    〔小刊〕指全国解放初期胡风集团在上海出的刊物“起点”。
    三、一九五○年一月十八日胡风给绿原信（北京）
    十三日信，昨天收到了。第一，发表后，惊住了一切人。但宠儿们，有些是装作没有看到的尴尬神气。那也好。第二，除接近的人以外，这里听不到意见。在天津，是烧起了的。………在第四中有猛烈的射击。你们那里如何？
    〔第一〕〔第二〕指胡风自己的诗“时间开始了”，第一篇“欢乐颂”，第二篇“光荣赞”。〔宠儿们〕指党的文艺工作者们。〔第四〕指“时间开始了”第四篇“安魂曲”，其中疯狂地诽谤革命，诽谤人民。
    四、一九五○年一月二十九日胡风给绿原信（北京）
    我大约三天四天就走了，想把过去告一段落，整理一下，排印一点，再来慢慢开始。……当然，在上海也困难得很，苍蝇蚊子太多了。
    〔苍蝇蚊子〕胡风骂一切革命文艺工作者的话。
    五、一九五○年四月十六日胡风给绿原信（上海）
    我是一个“难为水”的人，好像没有什么值得奇怪的事情。我们这个社会太老了，有些人，换装也还是照老习惯换，一眼就看得出他们还是把西装上衣当马褂穿。二四八月乱穿衣，看看他们展览奇装异服罢。用不着邹诗人操心，谁也看得出来的。至于我，因为有一点经验，闻一闻空气就早晓得要下雨的。但我看，第一炮之后，问题已经不完全在周老板，看看董事会作何估计罢，他是非得看董事会的脸色不可的。但当然，还得看看对手，还得看看群众反映。但董事会无内行专家，又要自己人不丢脸，又不明实况；群众反映不出来；对手呢，已装死躺下了。问题就是如此。不过，我看他们自己怕也觉得弦上之箭发得太快，太猛，过早地暴露了阵地，有点不容易搞罢。这些时，就在积极方面提拔什么，消极方面骂骂鸡，表示他们不是专做这个方面的箭手，也分散分散群众底注意。也可以说，梅兄启事是救了他们一手的。
  〔邹诗人〕指邹荻帆同志。邹曾写信给绿原，叫他劝胡风检讨。〔周老板〕指周扬同志。〔董事会〕胡风对中共中央的污蔑的代称。〔梅兄〕指陈守梅，即阿垅。一九五○年三月“人民日报”发表陈涌、史笃批评他的文章后，他曾写一短文承认他歪曲地引用马克思著作的译文的错误。这里所说的“启事”就是指这篇短文。所谓“第一炮”即指“人民日报”对阿垅的批评。
    六、一九五○年五月二十日胡风给贾植芳信（北京）
    令兄的信，显然是奉命写的。这说明了：那些人虚得很，不安得很，所以想用这办法先打点底子。守梅底事，使他们生涨幻想。不过，守梅也要反攻过去的。
    你回答得好。要这样对付那种无耻的招降手段。再来信，可以王顾左右而言他。这是一个斗争底前哨，大概一两年之内要大爆发的。那封信，希望给我看看，千万。可以研究出东西来的。
    〔令兄〕指贾芝同志。〔那些人〕指党，指贾芝同志的信是党要他写的。〔守梅〕即阿垅。
    七、一九五×年八月二十六日胡风给张中晓信（北京）
    被当作了“图腾”的小册子，这是现在最困难的问题。问题不一定是它本身有这大关系，而是一些低能兼恶意者变本加厉的做法。例如罢，“观察、体验、研究、分析”这说法，稍有人心者就应该抓住“体验”去提出问题，发展下去。而他们的做法却完全相反。这就做成功了一些乱七八糟的皂隶式的机械主义，耀武扬威，把现实主义底生机闷死了，尤其是对于年青的无名作者。形势又加强了这一大结：那些“批评家”都是当权者，别人哼都不敢哼，任何从实际出发的要求都要心惊胆战地给压下去。这样一来，还不会枯萎下去么？
    我想，你不要因为那就不写了。当然，字面上不要去碰它，可能的地方还要顺着它，如我在“路”所做的。但当然，写作品，就更不必管它了，虽然现在在他们刊物上发表是困难得很的。不要停止工作，我以为这是最主要的。路，只有从人民深处的要求走出来，在强盗和骗子群中走出来，忍辱负重地走出来，否则是没有办法的。
    〔被当作了“图腾”的小册子〕这是胡风对毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的污蔑的说法。（原始社会的人，把一种动物或其它自然物当作神圣来崇拜叫作“图腾”。）〔如我在“路”所做的〕“路”指胡风的“论现实主义的路”。这个反动的小册子的内容完全是反对毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的，但有时在字面上却“顺着”说几句，这里是胡风要他们集团中的人，采取同样方法，来欺骗读者。〔强盗和骗子〕污蔑党员和革命文艺工作者。
    八、一九五一年一月十六日胡风给牛汉信（北京）
    ……这僵尸统治的文坛，我甚至感觉得给它们发表了出来都不愉快。
    ……但我在磨我的剑，窥测方向，到我看准了的时候，我愿意割下我的头颅抛掷出去，把那个脏臭的铁壁击碎的。
    〔给它们发表〕指报刊上发表了胡风的诗“时间开始了”。
    九、一九五一年六月二十四日胡风之妻梅志给
        路翎信（上海）
    你能够去朝鲜我觉得是好的，不要管“人们”的动机吧。……他们这个调虎离山法，是必失败的，老虎养得精神，更能斗争！
    〔调虎离山法〕梅志把路翎去朝鲜诬为领导方面对路翎的“调虎离山”计。
    十、一九五一年九月二十八日胡风给绿原信（北京）
    ……去的时候，和“原始的”状态的一些同行者们玩得很好。如果和“改造”了以后的他们一道回来，当会玩得更好的。
    〔同行者〕指和胡风一起赴四川参加土地改革的人们。
    十一、一九五二年二月八日胡风给绿原信（上海）
    ……现在能做的，也还是从理论上去做“挖心战”。想从这一步去推动实际的局势。但这实在是近于冤枉的“麻烦”之事。首先，非看一些乱七八糟的东西不可，但这要得忍受生理上的厌恶才行的。现在只能有这样的实践。
    〔挖心战〕指从根子上破坏党的文艺政策、文艺理论。〔乱七八糟的东西〕指革命作家的作品。
    十二、一九五二年三月十七日胡风给谢韬信（上海）
    玉兄到那学校，当大有收获。我意，对那位黄药眠老爷，可能时花点时间收集一些材料。如能把他的面目暴露一下，那对于文艺前途是功德无量的。
    〔玉兄〕即卢玉，谢韬之妻。〔那学校〕指北京师范大学。
    十三、一九五二年五月二十四日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    看纪念的社论，似乎也看到了问题，杀机似乎还有，但已经不愿意说得太显了！
    〔社论〕指“人民日报”纪念“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年的社论。
    十四、一九五二年五月二十五日胡风给谢韬信（上海）
    那么，打算着手写一篇文章，抓一两个中心点（不谈过去），拥护“讲话”。因为有人提议了，所以不能不这样。写成了来京当面求教。
    〔“讲话”〕指毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”。
    十五、一九五二年十月二十七日胡风给牛汉信（北京）
    ……现在是，作家们都在求救于思想检查，求救于马列，我们无此福分，……
    这信是胡风诬蔑革命文艺工作者学习马克思列宁主义、诬蔑思想改造的。
    十六、一九五三年八月十七日胡风给满涛信（北京）
    现在还是，正是需要点滴斗争的时候，要遵守组织原则，但组织原则是为了保证斗争的。要正视现实，爱惜力量；否则，退一步就得退十步，退十步就非完全成为影子不止。今天正在争取转机之中，不能有一点不必要的伤亡。……
    〔组织原则〕指胡风反党集团的组织原则。
    十七、一九五三年八月二十二日胡风之妻梅志 给贾植芳信（北京）
    任敏是否按计划来京一次？我到此不觉快一月了，……女工到现在还未请着，只作协派一通讯员帮忙，其实他只有使我更忙，公家人不能不存戒心。
    〔任敏〕即贾植芳之妻。〔作协〕即中国作家协会。
    十八、一九五四年三月二十六日胡风给罗洛、张中晓信（北京）
    我在着手弄材料。未着手之前，总感到有些恶心，但着手一弄，反而忍不住要笑起来了。世界上有这样低能而又混蛋的畜生！但当然，是一件麻烦事，但也只好做了它。
    〔弄材料〕指胡风着手写给中共中央的报告。胡风在这信中咒骂批评过他的人。
    十九、一九五×年六月十六日胡风给冀汸信
    杨某之流，如小女人，无法当作人看待的。一篇关于曹禺的文章，就想当作飞黄腾达的资本，
  “希望”上登了吕荧的批评，从此就结下了血仇。还有什么话可说呢？
    〔杨某〕指杨晦同志。第二胡风如何扩大以他为首的反动集团的组织、建立活动据点、派遣他的集团分子打进党内进行偷窃文件、探听情况等反革命活动一、胡风采取种种卑劣手段，“联络人”，为他的集团的分子安插活动地盘，指挥他们的活动
    二○、一九四九年五月七日胡风给方然、冀汸、朱谷怀、罗洛等人信（北京）
    友人柏山（彭冰山现名）在二十四军政治部工作，我曾复他信时，谈到你们和嗣兴，守梅，可能时要他找你们去工作。但然兄有旧关系，恐怕非得通过旧关系才好。张友渔被任为北京市副市长，必要时可电他，我拟去面谈。
    〔嗣兴、守梅〕即路翎、阿垅。
    二一、一九四九年五月三十日胡风给路翎信（北京）
    ……得彭冰山（柏山）信，他到了南京，已给你信约见。或者已经见了面罢。但不知谈得怎样？看情形，新写的东西，可先给他看看。南京做文教工作的白丁，从前也在一起过，也许柏山介绍你见他。
    杭州几个人，我曾给柏山介绍过。这次来信没有提。看情形，问到时可提出谈谈。如见到白丁，也可提出谈谈。在介绍给柏山时，我曾说到政治上我绝对保证。小刘、罗洛在上海，有机会时也可提出谈谈的。……
    〔柏山〕即彭柏山。〔白丁〕即徐平羽同志。〔小刘、罗洛〕均胡风集团分子。
    二二、一九四九年九月四日胡风给路翎信（北京）
    徐平羽，去找他没有？要去找他，明英事（顶好回原处），剧本事，工作事……。剧本，改好了请他看，请他“提意见”，这是一种好“习惯”了的做法。以后得多找他，以后的工作得在他的了解和同意之下做去，这就合于一般规矩。他说过愿支持你，那你应争取他的支持，为了工作。在现在的情况之下，这一层你非做好不可。
    那么，找白丁，明英事顶好回原处，以她可以养成技术人员为理由，实际也如此。剧本，改后给白丁看，由他发动上演。我说了一点我的看法，他非常赞成。……也得和他太太（林果）好好接触。
    二三、一九五×年二月十六日胡风给张中晓信（北京）
    我想，能做的做，能忍耐的忍耐，恐怕只好如此。和那些刊物通信，不会有什么结果的，因为，那些掌权者都是长了硬壳的幸运儿，不会有什么感觉的。但如果是试用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术，那是可以试一些时的。
    以你的情形，做职业不合适，一站上“岗位”，就非拖垮身体不可。我想，写点短文换点稿费罢。散文、读书随笔之类，每千字有三万左右。不能长（只能二——四千一篇），当然也要避免太尖锐的东西，当作糊口手段，但当然也不必说空话。上海，可寄“建国东路南天一坊五号梅林”，他在编
  “文汇报”的“文学界”（周刊），也许还要改杂志。此人对现状不满，可以通过他漏一点东西出去的。北京，可寄“光明日报”副刊试试。汉口，可寄“大刚报”曾卓，说是我介绍的。杭州可寄“扇子巷安徽中学朱声（即方然）”，也可以说是我介绍的。他是浙江文协主席，在编“浙江日报文艺周刊”。先在这几个地方试试罢。
    二四、一九五二年二月八日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    曾起过意，想送给这里当局，同时附一份“祖国”去，介绍上演，甚至想直接给“夏公”。不过是捣乱之意。雪苇说，可以。过几天，再商量一下看看吧。
    你那里，想有一个时期的纠缠。得汉口信，说在“通讯”上看到了关于你的话。
    ……顶好能弄到一份“通讯”。原兄说，你这“赤膀上阵”（？）的办法，他认为是不好的。
    那么，……应该与谢、徐、阎等讨论研究，得些启示。问题当然是这样一个问题，但为了少些浪费，就得走得稳，要抓就抓得准。万一没有把握就不如用拖的方法。
    〔祖国〕即路翎的剧本“祖国在前进”。〔夏公〕指夏衍同志。〔得汉口信〕指汉口的胡风集团分子（如绿原、曾卓等）的信。〔“通讯”〕指“文艺报”的“内部通讯”。〔谢、徐、阎〕指谢韬、徐放、阎望。
    二五、一九五二年五月三十日胡风给绿原信（上海）
    ……在整风中，主要的一条是谈领导，并检查自己，除了同组的，是不要扯远的。解放以前，只是各自为战，解放以后，是各各在领导下做工。谁和谁也不是穿连裆裤的，而创作的人，又不专业理论，没有牵在一起的道理。宁兄处就专谈他自己，从未牵到别人的。外省比较远些，但也应求得如此。谁也负不起别人的担子。曾兄也可以如此。
    万一要谈，也只能谈个人印象，那倒可以谈谈，因为那是和所提出的相反的。只除了不通俗一项，但因为自己是知识分子，又是理论文字，当时没有觉得。……万一要证明自己所受的影响，是好的，那就有：愿意长期到群众中去改造自己；不是屡次提出了要求么？至于别人受了不好影响，但那是别人的事，有机会研究好了。但并非一定要我研究罢。云云。
    〔在整风中〕指当时文艺界的整风。胡风在这封信里指示绿原如何在整风中对党进行欺骗，掩盖胡风及其集团的反动活动。
    二六、一九五二年八月十二日胡风给绿原信（北京）
    问题并不那么简单。刚才昆乙说，要无耻来参加，一周多以后可来云。这是三反五反的做法，当然要有一通胡缠的。他是风云儿，过武汉一定红得很。对他尽量和气些，多请教，看问题在什么地方，尤其重要的是，他会不会弄节外生枝的手段？千万和和气气的请教他，愈多愈好，那是有益的，为了学习。当然，我也希望从你间接得到教益。
    〔昆乙〕指周扬同志。〔无耻〕指舒芜。胡风因为舒芜写了检讨错误的文章，恨之入骨，称他为“无耻”，但在这封信里却又指示绿原在舒芜过武汉时“对他尽量和气”，怕他“节外生枝”，企图间接从他得到一些消息。
    二七、一九五二年十月二十六日胡风给绿原信（北京）
    在你的情况，只能实事求是，应该好处的。“外”攻，总是如此，不惜言过其实，甚至言无其实的。因为，没有“材料”，如三反五反中所见，就会如此，而且不会想到弄出假老虎来，弄到不能收场的。坦然处之，实事求是，也就其怪自败了。
    那么，（一）解前你和吾止关系很浅，说不上什么“共同性”，解释得了的，（二）和谷只投稿关系，（三）和别人也关系很浅甚至无的。事实如此，也就只能如此的，……那写的，通不过就暂如此罢。或者把底子寄来看看。
    〔解前〕即解放前。〔吾止〕指舒芜。胡风这封信是在舒芜发表了“致路翎的公开信”以后写的，指示绿原如何掩盖他和胡风集团的密切关系。并要他把“检讨”的底稿先寄给胡风看。〔谷〕指胡风。
    二八、一九五三年十月十二日胡风给罗洛、张中晓信（北京）
    我想，怕事，为自己，……这就弄到屈服和牺牲别人，但为了向上爬，似乎还不至于。所以，似应从积极的意义上去争取，必要的斗争非做不可，但也是为了争取。尽可能接近，说服，必要时拆穿，但也是为了争取。争取做一些工作，出主意，提意见，耐心地去“帮助”他，也是为了争取。从现在的情况看，当然不能信任，但也不能完全不信任。
    〔怕事，为自己……〕这里说的是曾为胡风分子之一的王元化。王元化在检讨了他的错误思想以后，胡风指挥另两个胡风集团分子罗洛、张中晓包围他，“争取”他继续为胡风集团服务。“他”，即指王元化。二、胡风和他的反动集团使用阴谋手段、建立活动据点、竭力扩大他们的影响
    二九、一九五一年十一月十八日胡风给绿原信（北京）
    我写了一首五百多行的分行散文，也许这几天可以见报。……如不起副作用，你可向你的上级说一声，作者愿意你们转载，不给稿费也可以的。
    〔你的上级〕指汉口“长江日报”负责人，当时绿原在“长江日报”社。胡风令绿原为他的“诗”寻找转载的地方，扩大他们的影响。
    三○、一九五一年十一月二十九日胡风给路翎信（北京）
    昨天金山来。他是青年剧院副院长，廖承志院长。希望你来青年剧院，不受拘束，就是剧本由他们首演。生活负责，家属也负责，或找适当工作。要到工厂或什么地方，也尽力帮助。他们肩膀大，……我想这到是一个适宜地方。
    在外地和小耗子们缠，实在吃力，倒不如到这里来为好。
    三一、一九五×年×月×日胡风给耿庸信（北京）
    关于出版问题：………………
    二、……似不宜争取在新文艺出版。新文艺这岗位要保存，由它出，说不定要遭忌，受到“组织”手段的妨害的。
    三、泥土出，发行会生问题，且会使它更遭忌，以至寿终。——万一无法出，也就只有由泥土出了。
    四、顶好找另一家出。如由贾找文化工作社，等。得努力一下看。报酬不计，不要都可以。
    五、时期。弄妥了就可出，似不必等了。暂时不会有“好”时机的。印出了的效果是：（一）在某些圈子杀他们的气焰，使他们知道天下不容易
  “太平”，（二）刺激得他们更疯狂起来。但，现在已经疯狂，狂得再凶一些也无所谓。两种效果都有的。
    六、署名。能在别一家出，换一个署名，不会有人知道，当然好。
    〔关于出版问题〕指耿庸的“阿Q正传研究”的出版问题。〔新文艺〕指新文艺出版社。〔泥土〕指泥土社。〔贾〕指贾植芳。
    三二、一九五二年三月四日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    华东一踏糊涂，上海当然也如此。现已调柏山接黄源副部长的工作，可见是迫不及待了。但在柏山，如果没有可能开辟岗位，那只能是一个打扫前人的臭茅房的玩意儿。……他后天来报到接事，大概一两个月内能见端绪。
    〔副部长〕即前华东军政委员会文化部副部长。由胡风集团分子之一的彭柏山担任这个工作，胡风是抱着“开辟岗位”的莫大“希望”的。
    三三、一九五二年五月九日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    ……斗争未有不用血可以得到的。血流得不少了，但以后就可以学得战术一些，尽量少流，宁愿在空气坏的洞中多待，“保存力量”。……
    三四、一九五二年三月十七日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    柏山来后，想我帮弄华东，留在上海。但探问一下，觉得中央不会批准（他的意见可以在此通过），所以主张只弄自己的问题，不要提意见云。
    三五、一九五二年五月二十九日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    ……这里提出，华东剧院（话、歌、交响乐三团，共二百余人），或者还有一个刊物。好处是：独立单位，接触群众。到北京，无论如何不会有这样工作机会的。但困难很多：（一）不在北京，总是若即若离的状况，（二）接触面不能大，被限住了，（三）夏管文艺（副部长），（四）柏、雪二人肩膀只那大，柏在华东可以顶住，但在上面他是不能回嘴的。
    就是这么一个情况。我想，文章写起了，争取到京一次，不得已，只好在华东弄一两年再看。此事望与谢、徐二兄谈谈，但不要告诉别人。你们看如何？
    〔夏〕指夏衍同志。〔柏、雪〕指彭柏山、雪苇。
    〔谢、徐〕指谢韬、徐放。
    三六、一九五二年五月二十九日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    ……小说抄寄了，改了题目，但奇怪的是，由那个报退了回来，附信说主题人物都较好，但人物
  （尤其是军代表）写得歇斯特里，受了某某写法的恶劣影响，劝作者深入斗争去，云。显然地，贵人并不忘事，看出来了。不好的是，看出这一做法，以后更加小心。由此可见仇恨之深。
    〔小说〕指路翎的一篇小说。〔那个报〕指我们的某一报纸。胡风采取“改头换面”的方法，把他的集团的具有错误思想的作品投寄报刊。〔某某〕指路翎。三、胡风派遣他的集团的分子打进党内进行偷窃文件探听情况等反革命活动
    三七、一九五二年三月十七日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    甸兄听部长说，讨论我的问题时机成熟了，柏山来后探问了一下，……。那么，也许要玩一玩么？我甚至怀疑乔爷生病也是专门在“研究”问题的。要求见面提意见，是否适宜，现在也在踌躇了。此事写在给谢兄信中。
    〔甸兄〕指芦甸。〔乔爷〕指胡乔木同志。〔谢兄〕指谢韬。
    三八、一九五二年三月二十七日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    那铅字的纲要，不知太兄徐兄能借到看一看否？卢兄也许可能，英君当会看到了的。
    〔那铅字的纲要〕指某一党内材料。〔太兄〕指阎望。〔徐兄〕指徐放，打入党内的胡风集团分子。
    〔卢兄〕指芦甸，打入党内的胡风集团分子。〔英君〕指阿英同志。芦甸曾数次从阿英同志处获得党内文件和情况
    三九、一九五二年四月十日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    得甸信，附寄关于杨耳等的错误检查报告。
    甸兄将把那抄给你一份的。很有用。
    〔检查报告〕指一个党内材料。胡风令芦甸将这个材料偷给胡风集团。
    四○、一九五二年四月十六日胡风给冀汸信（上海）
    那“批评”当然不是一件小事，这是酝酿了三年以来的杀机。还有，余芳是该报通讯员，有十五号的“内部通讯”，即向通讯员们征求胡某文艺思想的稿件，等于一次战斗动员。你们可找来看看。
    学习二三两期上，几位理论红人底文章，犯了错误，连宣传部负责人都做了检讨（此事不必说出去）。
    〔那“批评”〕指“文艺报”对胡风的批评。〔学习〕指“学习”杂志。
    四一、一九五二年（未注月日）胡风给路翎信（上海）
    五、向芦兄要来陈向中央的报告（关于“学习”）
    〔芦兄〕即芦甸。〔陈向中央的报告〕指一件党内材料。这个材料又由胡风转抄给路翎，附在这封信内。
    四二、一九五二年五月十九日胡风给谢韬信（上海）
    昨得信，说于刚看过你，谈到我的问题。谈话内容如何，请告诉我。要全部内容，他的话，你的话，你的印象，最后结语，等。他的谈话，可以作为某一种的反映的。望即告我，详尽地。
    我五月四日发出信，七日可以寄到。信可能经他的手送上去，因而可能听到副座的话。如果他和你见面是七日以后，那么，很可能，他是有所为而和你见面的。因而，你的意见，也会对他有影响的。
    如能再见到于，可吐露：一、几年来胡想工作，二、想搬来北京，得不到帮助。当然，你不能去找他谈这些的。
    〔副座〕指周总理。这里，胡风指挥他的集团分子谢韬到于刚同志处探听情况，并进行有利于胡风集团的活动。第三胡风如何指挥他的反动集团分子向党和党所领导的文艺战线发动猖狂的进攻，并在进攻失败以后，如何布置退却，掩护自己，以待时机一、胡风指挥他那个反动集团的分子用卑鄙无耻的手段攻击“文艺报”，企图达到不准批评胡风的目的
    四三、一九五○年八月十三日胡风给张中晓信（上海）
    现在是，在一个罩子下面，许多读者都昏昏沉沉的。一、“舆论”一律，一个普通读者也实在难于判断。二、绝对大多数读者都在某种组织生活中，那里空气是强迫人的。三、文艺上的问题也实在以机械论最省力。不过，虽然如此，目前到处有反抗的情绪，到处有进一步的要求，所以，那些指导家，一面觉得压得很吃力，一面又更觉得非压不可。到底如何，半年左右不知能看出一点端倪否？但重要的是要读者说话，被压住也还是要说话。慢慢地，看能否冲破一些缺口来。目前，只有独占的刊物，如果不冲破，那就非闷死不可了。
    和那个“报”，当然讨论不出什么来。一切都是“计划”出来的，如部长所宣布的那样。但近来，他们心里渐渐着慌了。最近他们在一个会上说，接到了不少抗议批评“时间”的信，但一一回了信，
  “说服”了云。就是这么一回事！但如果和他们开开玩笑，使他们知道知道世上人不能尽欺，使他们更气弱下去，通通信当然是好的。但你的身体和邮费，恐怕都不值得。——和你通信的大概就是这位萧殷本人。便中把他“劝”你读他的书的信寄给我，将来开会有我时也许要当作“营私”的证据提出去的。同时，给我一封短信，用探交的口吻，说是气愤他们，提到他们不回答对沙诗人的抗议，并把来信给我看看。必要时，提出去证明他们并没有“说服”，只是压下暗牢而已。
    〔那个“报”〕指“文艺报”。〔部长〕指周扬同志。
    〔“时间”〕指胡风的诗“时间开始了”。“文艺报”一卷十二期，二卷四期上有些文章曾批评到它。胡风这里所说的“抗议”，都是他策动他的反革命集团中的人作的。在他的策动之下，张中晓、耿庸等化成几十种名字写信到“文艺报”编辑部疯狂地漫骂批评胡风的人为“蛆虫”、“低能的蚊子”、“泼妇”等，并且用下流的流氓口吻写道：“谁要再说昏话，我就要×他祖宗十八代！”他们甚至捏造几十个人的假座谈会纪录，寄给“文艺报”，威胁该刊，不许以后再发表对胡风的批评。〔沙诗人〕指沙鸥同志。他在“文艺报”一卷十二期的“谈诗的偏向”中曾批评到胡风的“安魂曲”（“时间开始了”中的一篇）。
    四四、一九五○年八月二十四日胡风给耿庸信
    退回再寄去，让他们为难一下，是好的。但不知上次换了名字否？顶好换名字。不过，如上次未换，中间不好换了。再，文章要展开分析、说明，一则他们在宗派之外还有一个低能，但主要的还是对读者有说服力，虽然百分之九十九不能刊出来。
    “光明日报”还是沙鸥引的那一段的“批评”，至于“大众诗歌”，那是全部否定，简直完全暴露了黄药眠自己。……等他们回信后再说。那时，你可以把来信寄我，并用初次通信的口气写一信给我提出对他们的意见。两三个月后，可能在北京，那时就可以作为材料对他们提出批判。这类材料，已有几处寄来了。………………
    我想，你的文章写法，要好好改进一下，突击式地刺入一点，现在绝对不能被接受的。当然，尖锐性无论如何不能失去，但要寄托在分析和说明里面，而且要警惕“态度”问题，现在所对的并不是“敌人”，而且都是“领导者”呀！再就是，要再看些马列主义和苏联的文艺理论批评，为了“字面”上要站稳“立场”，一不小心，别人就会用这打死你的。…………
    如有同感友人，可弄一个小座谈会之类，现在需要这类工作，还得从少数做起。
    〔让他们为难一下〕“他们”指“文艺报”编辑部。
    〔光明日报……〕“光明日报”也曾发表文章批评胡风的诗。〔沙鸥引的那一段〕，指沙鸥同志在“文艺报”一卷十二期上那篇短文中所引的胡风的“安魂曲”中的一段。〔大众诗歌……〕“大众诗歌”曾发表过黄药眠同志批评胡风的诗的文章。〔要警惕“态度”问题……〕胡风在这信里指示他的集团分子不要公开地用对待“敌人”的态度来反对党和党所领导的文艺界，以免暴露他们的真面目。
    四五、一九五○年九月十四日胡风给张中晓信（上海）
    对那个“报”，还是缠住它，因为，再没有阵地了。为了累倒它，为了冲破它，就得缠住它。但我以为，不必尽用信的形式，有些可以用文章的形式寄去，但当然，要写得谨重，本于为真理的态度。或者在你们中间先经过讨论，甚至用参加者（同意了的）连名寄去。这是战争，也是锻炼。关于
  “时间”，可能时就这样做。因为，这个事件成了中心，可能成为导火线。现在这样做，他们百分之九十九不会登的，但这就成了神经战，使他们不安。材料多了，或者我自己出面，那他们是不能不登的罢。关于史、陈，也可以这样的。他们不是要你们写成文章的么？
    〔那个“报”〕指“文艺报”。〔“时间”〕指胡风的诗“时间开始了”。〔史、陈〕指一九五○年三月在“人民日报”上发表过批评阿垅的文章的史笃、陈涌两同志。二、胡风指示路翎用狡诈手段欺骗领导同志，并掩盖胡风集团的真面目
    四六、一九五○年五月三十一日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    见面事，看情形考虑一下。主要的，要得到对剧本的包围可以多少松一点。一要看情形，二要先告廖，看他的表情，三要时间愈短愈好，给它一个闪烁的东西，不谈文，少谈文，谈些工厂之类。问到梅事，似应避开，例如没有细看，觉得问题很多云云………
    〔见面事〕指当时周扬同志打算约路翎谈话一事。
    〔廖〕指廖承志同志。〔梅事〕“梅”指阿垅，“梅事”指“人民日报”发表文章批评阿垅一事。
    四七、一九五○年八月二十九日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    ……应为人剧争取一个实验演出，其次英剧早些弄成，先交廖一个人先看，要求他只回答一个问题：在政治上是否成立？如果肯定了就交给剧院，要求速决，提出来不愿像上次那样拖，用软刀子慢慢割。应拒绝无理的修改意见。据我看，他们很有可能以英剧为人剧的转环，那么早提出就有可能闷死人剧了。……
    情形是严重的，他们“沙漠化”的做法，恐怕还要继续一个时期。两剧的使命太大了。
    〔人剧〕指路翎的剧本“人民万岁”。〔英剧〕指路翎的剧本“英雄母亲”。〔廖〕指廖承志同志。
    四八、一九五二年六月十三日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    部来领导，得好好准备。我看，小组结论不会拿出来，由部来重弄过。但关于无耻，一定要你发言罢。当然揭露他。而且，那文章，并非当作肯定意见，而是作为讨论的（你当时听到如此），而且，当时没有人完全同意他。揭露他想当教授；刘邓大军时不参加，事后大家对他不满；解放后劝他在南宁，他却老想出来，向上爬；来北京时满口冷嘲，大家厌恶他……。——关于小集团：不知道。向来个人投稿，不用者甚多。从未开过会。…………
    那么，在你那面，可能是硬来了。也许以无耻所提者来试攻。
    第一，是在一起过。但对他的书生气和虚无气（把他叫做五四遗老）一向不满，争论很多，没有谁说过A、B、C的话，恐怕只有他才这样想的。
    第二，厌恶马列主义云云，完全相反。他当时总是以谈马列主义为得意的，自己也正在读一些马列主义，正在以为用马列主义认识社会的入门中，颇为沉醉的。……
    第四，他总想弄文艺批评之类，以为他的哲学可以应用得很“深刻”，自己以为他不懂现实斗争，也不懂文艺，劝他不要弄，也有过争论。A、B、C的话，大概是他如此想的。那时，我们是研究了讲话，所以立志要写劳动人民的。
    第五，解放后不通信。见面时，想来北京。但看得出他是一副冷嘲态度，小贵族的心情。等等，你再考虑，作准备。
    总之，要把这看“严重”些。
    〔部来领导〕“部”指中央文化部。当时路翎所在的中国青年艺术剧院决定改属中央文化部领导。〔无耻〕指检讨了错误以后的舒芜。胡风这封信写于“人民日报”转载了舒芜的检讨“从头学习‘在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’”之后，指示路翎如何掩盖胡风反动集团的真面目。〔A、B、C的话〕舒芜在上述的检讨文章中曾揭发胡风集团分子诋毁毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”不过是“马列主义A、B、C”。〔讲话〕指毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”。
    四九、一九五二年六月二十六日胡风给路翎信（上海）
    一，昆乙，无论硬来软来，都要以软包硬的好态度去对之。实事求是，不能随便攻，也不能随便退一步。这是一个重要问题。要使他觉得可用而不可欺。
    二，三个办法：1、扭住那个报先打；2、端上去；3、赶快写好，但搁一些时再看。这要看实际状况决定。也许在小组上试探一下，对那个报应如何处理？总之，准备是一定要准备起来。
    〔昆乙〕指周扬同志。〔那个报〕指“文艺报”。三、胡风动员他的反动集团的力量，准备向党进行疯狂的进攻
    五○、一九五四年三月二十六日胡风给罗洛、张中晓信（北京）
    你们社成立以来，出了哪些坏书，为什么出了，出了哪些好书，出之前后，受了什么波折和打击。得开列一简单的表告诉我。
    〔你们社〕指上海新文艺出版社，胡风分子罗洛、张中晓、耿庸等均由胡风经刘雪苇关系打进该社。这信是胡风指挥罗、张收集该社内部材料。
    五一、一九五四年四月五日胡风给罗洛、张中晓、耿庸等人信（北京）
    你们工作忙，但如有多少可能，希望开始便中帮我做一件工作。
    分析二文的论旨和论点：
    一、查出他们所引用的论点。
    二、对他们每一个论断分条写出看法（从当时条件和原文主题）。
    三、提出可参考的材料（马至斯，高、鲁、毛，现在苏联理论），论点，出处，页数。
    四、引用何、香港各文……等“理论”，相同者及错误的可以对照者——出处及页数。
    现在得做这个准备，实事求是地帮我准备，免得考虑不周。我一安定下来也许就得做这一工作的。〔二文〕指林默涵、何其芳同志一九五三年发表的批
    评胡风的文章。
    五二、一九五四年四月十九日胡风给谢韬信（北京）
    昨晚开始弄“民族形式”，还顺利。
    这涉及到了列宁底两种文化论。列宁说的是“资产阶级民族”，或现代国家，斯大林底“民族”这个范畴也是这样规定的。但列宁底话，我记不得直接出处。得便，烦你查一查，抄两三条给我。一、原文，二、出处。能是直接的引用，当然要好一些。
    〔民族形式〕指胡风向中共中央作的“报告”中“关于民族形式”部分。为了写这个向党进攻的“报告”，胡风集团的许多分子都秘密地参加了这个活动。胡风曾把他这个“报告”的提纲交给在北京、上海、南京等地的胡风集团骨干分子，进行讨论。
    五三、一九五四年七月二十六日胡风给罗洛、张中晓信（北京）
    欧阳还在此。大概一周左右回南京。如果他无公到上海，那你们把一个人到南京一次。他知道全部内容，你们了解了以后，好赶作准备。斗争展开时希望能做得彻底些。他自己，在等公事中，这几天也在准备一篇，检查对宁兄批评底发展过程，抓出那阴谋性。
    现在想到的，你们有三个工作可作。
    （一）解放以来，批评宁兄的同时，肯定的是一些什么东西。检查以后，觉得有用时就作一简明的原则性的分析，作为宗派主义为了继续庸俗社会学统治的说明。
    （二）在二马编的作品中，检查那工作态度和用意。也作一简明的原则性的分析，准备对二马的。
    （三）检查新文艺以来，出了些什么不应该出的东西，排斥了些什么应该出的东西。准备一下，必要时向上面提出，说明宗派统治的危害性。
    你们考虑一下，如觉得能行，现在就着手准备，等欧阳谈过后作决定。
    见过欧阳以后，看是否你们有一个再去看看声兄，将情况告诉他，希望他也有准备。
    此事不能给任何人一点点暗示。
    〔欧阳〕指胡风集团分子欧阳庄。这信是胡风提出他的向党进攻的“报告”后，策动他的反革命集团中人积极配合。〔二马〕指冯雪峰同志。〔新文艺〕指新文艺出版社。〔声兄〕指在杭州的方然，即朱声。四、胡风在疯狂进攻中的布置
    五四、一九五四年十月二十七日胡风给张中晓信（北京）
    这里情况已经在大动摇中，第一、作协党组连日在开会，大概是由先生们自己检查，提出汇报，中央再来最后考虑问题，这里面一定有许多好看的东西。今天甚至听说二十多万字的东西要出版了，如果真是这样，大概是上面已经决定了要彻底考虑考虑。
    第二、今天报上发表了袁诗人攻击“文艺报”的文字，这是一个很不平凡的现象，可以认为一则牺牲“文艺报”，想把主要责任推到“文艺报”身上，二则有些人“像袁诗人之类”赶快站住，要趁早抓住攻打铜墙铁壁的旗帜。第三、文联会上的重要发言也要公开发表了，这在上面也许为了推动斗争的发展，在先生们也许是要借此造成一个改良的局势。
    在这种情况下，几月来你社所发生的一些事情是有重大作用的。这些事实可以有力的证明问题的实质是什么，逃也逃不掉。
    那封信加了这样的头尾，你们研究一下，特别是后面，如和实际情况相符否？有什么可加的可以加进去，文字和说法，也要从便利于你们的斗争，观点上加以斟酌，斟酌后全钞一份寄来。
    〔这里情况〕指批判胡适派资产阶级唯心主义的运动展开以后的情况。〔二十多万字的东西〕指胡风向中共中央写的“报告”。〔袁诗人〕指袁水拍同志。
    〔那封信〕指胡风分子准备的一篇攻击文艺方面党的领导的文章。
    五五、一九五四年十一月二日胡风给张中晓信（北京）
    缺口已打开了，紧张得很。这不过是抓到的一个缺口，问题要全面展开，已经公开提出了。二马和该报“带头”检讨，并深入检查，够好看的！第一步检讨先发表，而且也不限于“红楼”一事的。当然，“诗人”捞了一把，但也只有由他。不过，他也逃不了的。
    ……得沉着地进行。性兄文要赶快才对。你如可能也应写一篇去。
    〔缺口〕指中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团召开联席扩大会议，检查“文艺报”的错误。〔诗人〕指袁水拍同志。胡风在扩大会议上，果然向“人民日报”、向袁水拍同志发动攻击。〔性兄〕指胡风分子冀汸。胡风催促冀汸、张中晓写文章配合他的进攻。
    五六、一九五四年十一月七日胡风给方然、冀汸信（北京）
    这里已在展开，今天第二次文联扩大会。我发了言。“报”问题不是孤立的，为领导倾向表现之一。以实例说明一二两卷即已奠定了这样的方向：立场上，向资产阶级投降，仇视青年作家和不同意他们的革命作家；理论上，以庸俗社会学看内容，以形式主义看形式。五年来，拖垮了。——把会议由“报”拖到全面。
    我的发言未完。下次会徐兄要发言提出控诉。
    原来还想你们也检查材料，现在只希望你们把这文章写好。要步步抓住透示出这是一个宗派的迫害，尖锐的指出他们的“理论”是资产阶级的。
    〔报〕指“文艺报”。〔徐兄〕指路翎。
    五七、一九五四年十一月十四日胡风给张中晓信（北京）
    在展开中。荒发言，画出了该“报”底本质，就一、二卷看，到今天一贯。庸俗社会学，美学上表现之一是形式主义（袁向俞平伯投降），因而，向资产阶级挑战（朱光潜）求饶（蔡仪、编者），打击有生力量（小人物），不准小人物以马列主义
  “常识”进行斗争（如阿垅）。收集一批盲目信仰的读者，造成“群众基础”，如“内部通报”，打击要打击者。透出这是一个宗派主义统治的问题。从垅事剥出了袁“诗”人。徐发言，暴露了经过，以子周为主的计划打击。点了十来个人的名。日内抛出反批评去。他暴露了“销毁”事，并已向中宣部汇报。
    而，性兄文完全要不得！真使人难过。
    〔荒发言〕荒即胡风自己。发言，指他在中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议上的发言（发表在“文艺报”一九五四年二十二期上）。〔群众基础〕这是胡风诬蔑“文艺报”的通讯员。〔内部通报〕指“文艺报”给通讯员阅读的内部刊物。〔子周〕指周扬同志。〔性兄〕即冀汸。
    五八、一九五四年十一月十四日胡风给方然信（北京）
    这里已开三次对“报”的会。在二、三次会上，荒胖子作了三小时的发言。就一、二两卷看，那错误到现在是一贯的。特点为：理论武器是庸俗社会学，在美学上的表现之一是形式主义，向资产阶级（人物）投降（袁水拍向俞平伯投降）；因而，一方面碰到资产阶级就投降（蔡仪、编者向朱光潜的挑战求饶），另一方面，对新生力量（小人物）打击（对于阿垅）。基本上，对马列主义的态度是：一方面送给资产阶级（朱、俞），一方面不准小人物，革命作家做斗争的武器（由阿垅到李、蓝）。其“群众基础”是：压下任何不同意见的读者，收集一批天真的信仰者、奉承者在周围，搞
  “内部通报”，打击所要打击的人，造成独立王国。这样，画出了宗派统治特征，要他们承认。——剥出了袁“诗人”对阿垅的压迫，搞出二马检讨还未接触问题。
    三次会上，徐作了二小时发言，剥出历史情况和此次打击是有计划的，子周为主，凤姐双木等一干人都同谋；提出了宗派和军阀统治。（在会上提出要求发表他的回答。）——会后反映好，打动了人；一般都隐隐承认了宗派主义是事实。
    这样，打乱了他们的“日程表”（想问题不扩大）。斗争正式展开了。徐文，约四万字，日内抛出去。
    〔报〕指“文艺报”。〔荒胖子〕指胡风自己。
    〔徐〕指路翎。〔子周〕指周扬同志。〔凤姐双木〕“凤姐”指丁玲同志。“双木”指林默涵同志。
    五九、一九五四年十一月二十五日胡风给方然信（北京）
    给阝信，这样当然是好的，应如此。但注意两种新情况：一、阝休假中，可能落到双木手里。宣一级，老底子作主，其他个人感情上有对立因素，又不摸中枢底，所以，毫不能解决问题。……二、也会用无耻事和你缠的。
    他们还想用无耻救命，反扑会，他也去了，很灰，可能准备要他出来咬几口的。
    〔给阝信〕指方然给陆定一同志的信，信中完全为胡风辩护。〔双木〕指林默涵同志。〔宣一级〕指中共中央宣传部。〔反扑会〕指在文联、作协主席团检查“文艺报”工作的第六次扩大会议上，一些同志对胡风的错误发言作了反驳。五、胡风在进攻失败后布置他的反动集团如何退却、如何掩护自己，等待时机，卷土重来
    六○、一九五四年十二月十三日胡风给方然信（北京）
    文章都已出来，想已见到。由此事，浪费一定很大。……被乐观估计所蔽，终于冒进，没有具体的分析具体情况，责任主要在我。……愧对战斗者们。
    如时间允许，来玩一次，旅费由这里筹措，如何？
    〔文章〕指他在文联和作协主席团扩大会议上向党进攻的发言和周扬同志批评他的发言的“我们必须战斗”等文章。
    六一、一九五五年一月二十日胡风给张中晓信（北京）
    我希望你极冷静地读它，看这里面批判了是什么，不能涉及的是什么，是不是有言过其实之处。……
    我就现在能有的理解写了“自我批判”，如果能发表，这就第一步放下了我的负担。至于和我有友谊的同志们，那和我是两回事，应该是就各人底劳动去看的。
    〔它〕指胡风写的所谓“自我批判”。胡风在这封信里把他的那篇假检讨的要点通知张中晓（因为节省篇幅，均从略），在同一天又把同样的内容写信通知方然。特别值得注意的是“不能涉及的是什么”这一句。
    六二、一九五五年一月二十四日胡风给张中晓信（北京）
    能沉着工作，那是非常好的。前几天有一封信，从那里就可以晓得情况。
    现在已经不是被动与否的问题了，你当能够很冷静很沉着研究问题的。前信所说的情况，文章出来之前，不必明显的说出去，只是有意见的人，不要再写信写文章了。现在不是谈这些的时候。
    〔文章出来之前〕这里的“文章”指胡风的所谓“自我批判”。这一封和以下几封都是胡风在批判他的运动开始以后，指示他那个反革命集团的分子一致停止进攻，如何掩护自己的信。
    六三、一九五五年一月二十四日胡风给冯异信（北京）
    我望你用冷静的沉着的心情看待已经发生的和就要发生的事情。…………
    再说一遍，望你用沉着的心情对待就要发生的事情。其次，好好自己研究，不要写信写文章或者发表不成熟的意见。这最要紧。
    六四、一九五五年一月二十六日胡风给贾植芳、任敏信（北京）
    久不通信，想来你好？问题有了新的发展，望你用极冷静极沉着的态度对待已经发生的和将要发生的事情，切不可草率行事，参加讨论，这只有更使问题难以处理，有热心的人，也希望你代为阻止。不要写文章或信表达自己的意见，现在这已不是“讨论”，而是“批判”。
    你是教书的，能不参加较好，万不得已时，就可以批判的地方说一点自己的意见吧。
    六五、一九五五年二月二日胡风给方然信（北京）
    ……因此想到你，如果上面还没有什么表示，也应该自己准备一下，先检查自己的错误文章，如释“战斗要求”，释“过程”，内容不妥之处，及发表过“逃集体”这种错误文章，再批评一下胡某，并可申明自己近年来不搞文艺，只偶尔写点作家研究，但总觉得有问题，而没有能正视。该怎样做才好，你自然比我更知道。
    汸兄搞创作的，他可以用不懂来回答，不表示什么意见，但是如看出错误来了，还是该表示一下的。
    〔“ 释‘战斗要求’”“释‘过程’”〕是方然过去写的宣传反动思想的文章。发表在“希望”上。〔胡某〕指胡风自己。〔汸兄〕指冀汸。
    六六、一九五五年二月八日胡风给张中晓信（北京）
    不要痛苦，千万冷静。还有许多事情我们得忍受，并且只有在忍受中求得重生，一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来！所以将来在会中，千万不要生硬，应就胡等的错误发言。浦兄组织上如要他表示，可以写文章的，这已经没有什么了，究竟错多少？对多少？在群众的心里是有数的。
    〔胡等〕指胡风等人。〔浦兄〕也指胡风自己。
    六七、一九五五年二月十三日胡风给张中晓信（北京）
    浦兄要采取鲜明的批判态度，千万不要被动，不得已时，也可就一般问题，写点短文，你自己也应如此。其他熟识的人，可将此意转告。
    〔浦兄〕指胡风自己。
    六八、一九五五年二月十三日胡风给方然信（北京）
    为湘事正视自己的作品当然好，但同时要表明态度，如过去关系密切，但理论方面自己不关心，说不上影响，解放后自己在党的教育下深入生活，和他仅只见过一次面，很少通信等等，其次如谈话开会之类，要就立场等问题采取鲜明的批判态度，再其次，不得已时，也可以就一般问题写一短文，当然是就见解上说的，千万千万不要被动。………
    你的事虽不在圈子内，但草君谈话中提到，似乎很重视，想来决不会置之一旁的。先向直接领导表示态度，应该有此必要，而且还应该作进一步的准备。此间对“呼刊”及“希刊”上之短文均非常注意。已作为资料印出。
    〔为湘〕即胡风集团分子冀汸。〔和他仅只见过一次面〕“他”指胡风自己。〔“呼刊”及“希刊”〕指胡风集团的刊物“呼吸”和“希望”。
    从以上的材料，我们可以看出：（一）解放以来，胡风集团的反党反人民的阴谋活动更加有组织、更加扩大了，他对党和党所领导的文艺战线的进攻更加猖狂了；（二）如一切反革命集团一样，他们的破坏活动总是采取隐蔽的或者两面派的方式进行；（三）由于他们的阴谋被揭露，胡风集团不能不被迫从进攻转入退却，但这个仇恨党、仇恨人民、仇恨革命达到了疯狂程度的反动集团，绝不是真正放下武器，而是企图继续用两面派的方式保存他们的“实力”，等待时机，卷土重来。胡风用“在忍受中求得重生”“一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来”这类的话来鼓励他的集团的分子，就是明证。反革命的胡风分子同其他公开的或暗藏的反革命分子一样，他们是把希望寄托在反革命政权的复辟和人民革命政权的倒台的。他们认为，这就是他们要“等待”的“时机”。
    我们从胡风集团的阴谋活动这一事实必须取得充分的经验教训，必须在各个工作部门中保持高度的警惕性，善于辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子，把他们从我们的各个战线上清洗出去，这样来保卫我们已经取得的和将要取得的伟大的胜利。
