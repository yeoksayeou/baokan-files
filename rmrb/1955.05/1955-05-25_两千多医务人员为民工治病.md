More Than Two Thousand Medical Personnel Treat Laborers

　　In the Dongting Lake restoration project, more than two thousand medical personnel displayed a high degree of revolutionary camaraderie, treating patients on rounds at construction sites or in workers’ sheds, regardless of day or night, wind or rain, or bitter cold. Before going to bed at night, medical assistant Tan Zongzhi would always organize her medicine kit and place it beside her pillow. As long as someone called her outside the medical team's door, she would jump out of bed, pick up her medicine kit, and go out on a call, sometimes two or three times a night. Once, a laborer, Li Shu-huai, was injured in a fall, and the accumulated blood blocked his trachea. The blood had to be sucked out quickly, but there were no instruments on hand. Tan Zongzhi immediately used her own mouth to suck out the blood, allowing the patient's breathing to begin to improve. During a freeze, the body temperature of a sick worker, Yang Biao, suddenly dropped. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioner You Muchu immediately took off his clothes and gave them to Yang Biao to wear, and gave Yang Biao hot ginger tea to drink, but his temperature still did not rise, so he slept next to Yang Biao and used his own body to warm Yang Biao. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Tang Shitang publicly revealed twelve ancestral secret prescriptions, including thunder-fire acupuncture, on the construction site. In the West Dongting Lake construction area alone, dozens of practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine publicly revealed more than one hundred secret prescriptions.
　　More than two thousand medical personnel victoriously completed their glorious tasks as the lake management project was completed, and successively returned to their original work posts. Due to their warm concern and care for the patients, many laborers actively requested commendations for them during the on-site evaluation and selection of model workers, and some laborers exchanged contact information with them in order to maintain contact.

　　两千多医务人员为民工治病
    在修复洞庭湖的工程中，两千多名医务人员发挥了高度的革命友爱精神，不分白天黑夜、风雨严寒，在工地上或工棚里，巡回治疗。医士谭宗植晚上睡觉以前还把药包整理好，放在自己枕头旁边，只要有人到医疗小组的门外叫她一声，就翻身起床，提起药包出诊，有时一晚出诊两三次。一次，民工李树怀跌伤了，淤血阻塞在气管里，必须把淤血赶快吸出来，但手边没有器械，谭宗植立刻用自己的嘴把淤血吸出来，使病人呼吸开始好转。在冰冻中，生病的工人杨标的体温突然下降，中医游牧初马上把身上的衣服脱给杨标穿，送热姜块茶给杨标喝，但体温仍不上升，他就睡在杨标身边，用自己的身体给杨标取暖。中医汤世堂在工地上公开了雷火针等十二种祖传秘方。仅在西洞庭湖工区，就有几十个中医公开了一百多个秘方。
    两千多个医务人员，随着治湖工程的完成而胜利地完成了他们的光荣任务，陆续回到了原来的工作岗位。由于他们对病人的亲切关心和照料，在工地上评功选模的时候，很多民工主动为他们请功，还有一些民工和他们交换了通讯处，以便保持联系。　（本报驻长沙记者）
