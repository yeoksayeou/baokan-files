　　A new tool—the steel pipe threading and cutting machine—has recently appeared on the construction site of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.
　　In capital construction, a large number of industrial pipelines and plumbing steel pipes need to be laid. When these steel pipes are installed, they must be cut according to the required dimensions, and then the ends are threaded to connect them together. In the past, this part of the work was done manually, which was very inefficient and often affected the progress of the project. On the automobile factory construction site, where civil engineering and construction have mostly been mechanized, the backwardness of pipeline engineering is even more prominent. Therefore, accelerating the threading and cutting of pipelines and freeing pipeline workers from physical labor has become a common requirement of various construction sites.
　　From 1952, Xing Yanbo, a technician from the Provisional Engineering Office working on this construction site, began to design a steel pipe threading and cutting machine. However, because he could not solve the problem of allowing the machine to rotate without the steel pipe rotating (if this problem is not solved, only straight pipes can be threaded, not bent pipes, and the value of promotion is not great), it was not handed over to the manufacturing department for production. After two years of painstaking research, he was inspired by the threading machine he used as an apprentice in his childhood and solved the problem of the machine rotating without the steel pipe rotating in June 1954, completing the entire design of the steel pipe threading and cutting machine.
　　The production of the steel pipe threading and cutting machine began in July last year. During this period, Xing Yanbo personally participated in the trial production and went through several revisions. By April of this year, the entire production was completed. The final appraisal and performance were held.
　　This machine weighs 800 kilograms and resembles a lathe in a general machine manufacturing factory, requiring two people to operate it. In the past, it took four people fifty minutes to complete the threading and cutting work of a four-inch steel pipe. With this machine, it only takes two people four minutes and two seconds to complete, increasing efficiency by more than twenty times. In the past, it took four hours to make a five-inch steel pipe, but with this machine, it only takes five minutes. Therefore, when the steel pipe threading and cutting machine first met the pipeline installation workers, people were very happy. Some praised the machine for being light and flexible and having a wide range of uses; some said that it freed threading and cutting workers from heavy physical labor; and some repeatedly expressed their gratitude to Xing Yanbo, the creator of this machine.

    第一汽车制造厂工地最近出现了一种新工具——钢管套丝剪断机。
    在基本建设中，需要敷设大量的工业管道和水暖钢管。这些钢管在安装时都要根据需要的尺寸剪开，再把两头做成螺丝纹，以便互相联接起来。过去这部分工作是用人工做的，效率很低，经常影响工程的进度。在土木建筑工程大都机械化了的汽车厂工地，管道工程的落后现象就更为突出。因此，加快管道工程的套丝和剪断，解除管道工人的体力劳动，就成了各个建筑工地的共同要求。
    从一九五二年起，在这个工地上工作的暂设工程处的技术员邢彦博就开始设计钢管套丝剪断机，但是因为解决不了只让机器转动，不让钢管转动的问题，（这个问题不解决，就只能套直管，不能套弯管，推广的价值不大）。因而没有交给制造部门去制造。经过两年来的苦心钻研，他从幼年学徒时所用的套螺丝的机床上得到了启示，在一九五四年六月解决了机器转动，不让钢管转动的问题，完成了钢管套丝剪断机的全部设计。
    钢管套丝剪断机的制作，是从去年七月开始的。在这中间，邢彦博亲自参加了试制，又经过几度修改，到今年四月，全部制作完成。举行了最后鉴定和表演。
    这部机器重八百公斤，好像一般机器制造厂的车床，要两个人操作。过去要四个人，五十分钟才能做完套丝和剪断工作的四寸钢管，用这部机器只要两个人，四分零二秒的时间就能完成，效率提高了二十多倍。过去要四个小时才能做好的五寸钢管，用这部机器不过五分钟就能做成。因此，当钢管套丝剪断机第一次跟管道安装工人见面时，人们都很高兴，有的夸奖机器轻巧灵便，用途广；有的说它使套丝剪断工人摆脱了笨重的体力劳动；也有人一再向这部机器的创造者——邢彦博表示谢意。
