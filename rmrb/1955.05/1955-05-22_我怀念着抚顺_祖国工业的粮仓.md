To the Editor:
　　I have now been transferred from Fushun to work in Pingxiang. As I rode the south-bound train, crossing the roaring Yellow River and the Yangtze River, I missed the coal capital—Fushun, and even more so, the people struggling in the coal capital. I couldn't help but recall those days in Fushun.

　　Ah, Fushun, the granary of the motherland's industry! Supporting Anshan Iron and Steel is a constant, uninterrupted task for you. Almost everyone working in Fushun understands the significance of their labor. Those coal mining worker brothers work in three shifts, day and night, in a cycle; whoever produces one less coal car during their shift feels sorry to the country. In the early morning, along the Hun River valley, streetcars bustle back and forth, transporting workers to their production posts. In the evening, after work, countless people with satchels swarm into various technical night schools. Until late at night, the dispatch room in the Mining Bureau office building remains immersed in intense work, directing the production front—the coal face, striving to overfulfill production tasks and providing more coal as "rations" for the blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel. Day and night, the people working in Fushun bring more light and heat to the motherland.

　　"If you don't understand Fushun's past, you can't appreciate the beauty of Fushun today," a comrade once said. Yes, during the puppet Manchukuo and Kuomintang reactionary rule, this place was a hell on earth, the sky was dim, and the underground was gloomy and terrifying. People only came here to seek refuge and work in the mines when they were driven to the end of their rope. The result of the miners' year-round hard work was: "Once you arrive at Qianjin Village, you sell your bedding; new ones are exchanged for old ones, and old ones are exchanged for sacks." Since Fushun returned to the hands of the people, it has radiated a different kind of brilliance. I remember a leading cadre of the Mining Bureau once gave a popular summary of this diverse and beneficial ore body: "The underground coal can be used for steelmaking; the upper layer of the coal is rich oil shale, which can be used for oil refining; even the gas (methane) that comes out of the ground can be used to make carbon black." For the needs of the country's socialist construction, Fushun will undergo "overall transformation" according to socialist advanced science and technology. How much the people of the coal capital yearn for this magnificent and glorious undertaking!

　　Ah, Fushun! Just as you were unveiling the prelude to the "overall transformation," I was transferred to work at the Pingxiang Mining Bureau. I felt uneasy in my heart. But, this is the need of the motherland, and I gladly and happily left you. Leaders and comrades bid me farewell as if they were sending off their own relatives to the front line. I understand: Fushun must not only produce coal, but also produce cadres. Isn't that right? Having left you, we are about to throw ourselves into a new battle, and I will use the achievements of my work to express my deep remembrance of you.

### 我怀念着抚顺——祖国工业的粮仓

　　我怀念着抚顺——祖国工业的粮仓编辑同志：
    我现在由抚顺调到萍乡工作。当我乘坐着南去的列车，跨过了奔腾的黄河长江时，我怀念着煤都——抚顺，我更怀念在煤都里斗争着的人们，禁不住回忆起在抚顺的那些日子。
    抚顺啊，祖国工业的粮仓！支援鞍钢，在你来说是不间断的经常任务。几乎每个在抚顺工作的人都懂得自己劳动的意义。那些采煤工人弟兄，昼夜三班，循环作业；谁当班少出了一车煤，就感到对不起国家。清晨，沿着浑河峡谷，电车来回地奔忙着把职工送到生产岗位上去。黄昏，职工们下班以后，又有无数人背着书包涌进各种技术夜校。直到深夜，矿务局办公厅大楼上的调度室依然浸沉在紧张的工作里，指挥着生产前线——掌子头，争取超额完成生产任务，用更多的煤来供给鞍钢炼铁炉所需的“口粮”。就这样日夜不停地，在抚顺劳动的人们为祖国带来更多的光和热。
      “你不了解抚顺的过去，是没法体会今天抚顺的美好的。”一个同志曾经这样说。是的，在伪满和国民党反动统治时期，这里是人间地狱，天上暗淡无光，地下阴森恐怖。人们只有被逼迫到走头无路的时候，才来投奔这里，下矿井。矿工终年辛勤劳动的结果是：“一到千金寨，就把铺盖卖，新的换旧的，旧的换麻袋”。自从抚顺回到了人民的手中，就发出了异样的光采。记得矿务局一位领导干部对这个多样性的有益矿床体曾作过这样通俗的概括：“地下的煤可供炼钢；煤的上层是丰富的油母页岩，可供炼油；就连地下冒的那股气（瓦斯）也可制造炭黑。”为了国家社会主义建设的需要，抚顺将按照社会主义的先进科学技术来进行“总体改造”。煤都的人们多么向往着这壮丽辉煌的事业啊！
    抚顺啊！正当你揭开了“总体改造”的序幕之际，我被调到萍乡矿务局工作去了。我内心不安。但，这是祖国的需要，我欣然愉快地离开了你。首长和同志们像送别自己的亲人去前线一样。我懂得：抚顺不但要出煤，同时要出干部。不正是这样吗？离开了你，我们即将投入新的战斗，我要用工作的成绩来表示对你深切的怀念。
