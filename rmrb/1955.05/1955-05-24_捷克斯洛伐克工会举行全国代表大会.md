Xinhua News Agency, Prague: The Third National Congress of the Czechoslovak Trade Union, which opened in Prague on the 19th, closed on the 22nd. Czechoslovak Communist Party and state leaders Sapotocky, Siroky, Novotny and others attended the meeting.

　　The Congress heard and discussed the report on the work of the trade union and its future tasks by V. Supka, Acting Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions, and the report on the draft trade union constitution by J. Lakos, Secretary of the Central Council of Trade Unions. In his report, Supka described the activities of the Czechoslovak Republic Trade Union. He said that the trade union movement has penetrated into all departments of economic and social life. Socialist competition has played a major role in increasing the enthusiasm of trade unions. The rationalization proposal movement clearly demonstrates the creative enthusiasm of the working people. In 1954 alone, the Czechoslovak working people put forward 113,000 rationalization proposals, of which 45,000 (36 percent more than in 1953) have been implemented. The rationalization movement has saved a lot of money for the national economy. At the same time, the trade union is extremely concerned about the health and rest of the working people. In the past ten years, 2.8 million workers have recuperated in trade union sanatoriums. In 1954, the trade union paid 4,636 million crowns in accordance with the social insurance regulations of the working people, which is ten times the figure in 1937.

　　Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and trade union representatives from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other European, Asian, American and African countries delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress.

　　Liu Zihjiu, head of the Chinese trade union delegation, said in his speech that the Chinese people are not only closely concerned about the security and peace of Asia, but also pay attention to the security and peace of Europe. The Chinese people firmly oppose the Paris Agreement and the arming of West Germany, and actively support the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed at the Warsaw Conference. Let the people of our two countries unite more closely in this common struggle!

　　At the last meeting, the delegates unanimously adopted the new trade union constitution and the resolution on the activities of the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions and the future tasks of the trade union, and elected the new leading bodies—the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions and the Inspection Committee.

　　The newly elected Central Council of Trade Unions held its first meeting, and V. Supka was elected Chairman.

　　捷克斯洛伐克工会举行全国代表大会
    据新华社布拉格电　十九日在布拉格开幕的捷克斯洛伐克工会第三次全国代表大会已经在二十二日闭幕。捷克斯洛伐克共产党和国家领导人萨波托斯基、西罗基、诺沃提尼等参加了会议。
    代表大会听取并且讨论了工会中央理事会代理主席弗·苏普卡所作的关于工会工作及今后任务的报告，和工会中央理事会书记雅·拉科日所作的关于工会会章草案的报告。苏普卡在报告中叙述了捷克斯洛伐克共和国工会的活动。他说，工会运动已经深入到经济生活和社会生活的各个部门。社会主义竞赛在提高工会积极性方面起了很大作用。合理化建议运动明显地表现出劳动人民的创造积极性。仅仅在一九五四年，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民就提出了十一万三千件合理化建议，其中有四万五千件
  （比一九五三年多百分之三十六）已经实现了。合理化运动为国民经济节省了大量资金。同时，工会极其关心劳动人民的健康和休息。十年以来，有二百八十万名劳动者曾经到工会疗养所休养。一九五四年，工会根据劳动人民的社会保险条例支付了四十六亿三千六百万克朗，这一数字为一九三七年的十倍。
    世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬，苏联、中华人民共和国和其他欧洲、亚洲、美洲及非洲国家的工会代表相继向大会致了贺词。
    我国工会代表团团长刘子久在致词时说，中国人民不仅密切关怀着亚洲的安全与和平，同时也注视着欧洲的安全与和平。中国人民坚决反对巴黎协定和武装西德，并积极支持华沙会议签订的友好合作互助条约。让我们两国人民在这共同的斗争中更紧密地团结起来！
    在最后一次会议上，代表们一致通过了新的工会会章和关于捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会活动及工会今后任务的决议，选出了新的领导机构——捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会和检查委员会。
    新选出的工会中央理事会举行了第一次会议，弗·苏普卡当选为主席。
