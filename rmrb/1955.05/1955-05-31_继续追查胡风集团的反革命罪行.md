　　Continue to Investigate the Counter-Revolutionary Crimes of the Hu Feng Group
　　Ding Xilin
    The "People's Daily" published Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group" on May 13th, and on May 24th, it published "The Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group." These materials fully demonstrate that Hu Feng and his anti-Party group have been carrying out anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary conspiracies for a long time. The facts listed in the materials show that this counter-revolutionary group attempted to undermine not only the literary and art undertakings led by the Party, but our entire revolutionary cause.
    The insidious and vicious methods adopted by Hu Feng and his anti-Party group in carrying out their conspiratorial and criminal activities are appalling. They donned the cloak of Marxism and spread anti-Marxist literary and artistic theories everywhere; they waved the banner of revolution and carried out counter-revolutionary activities in every possible way; they used all kinds of cunning and deceptive methods that one could not imagine to find and expand their counter-revolutionary positions. The destructive behavior of this disguised, two-faced conspiracy organization is truly chilling.
    Today, the exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party group's conspiracy is a victory we have achieved in the struggle against the enemy. The Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers Association has already adopted a resolution on handling the Hu Feng anti-Party group's conspiracy incident. This resolution is completely correct. However, this struggle has not ended. We must continue to thoroughly investigate the counter-revolutionary crimes of Hu Feng and his anti-Party group. At the same time, we must firmly remember the experience and lessons of this conspiracy incident, heighten our vigilance, strengthen our unity, eliminate all saboteurs who have sneaked into our ranks, and track down the saboteurs hidden in every corner!

　　继续追查胡风集团的反革命罪行
　　丁西林
    五月十三日“人民日报”发表了舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”，二十四日又发表了“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”。这些材料充分地证明了胡风及其反党集团长期以来在进行反党、反人民、反革命的阴谋活动。材料中所列举的事实说明了这个反革命集团企图破坏的不仅是党所领导的文艺事业，而是我们整个的革命事业。
    胡风及其反党集团在进行阴谋罪恶活动时所采取的阴险毒辣手段是骇人听闻的。他们披着马克思主义的外衣，到处散布反马克思主义的文艺理论；他们打着革命的招牌，无孔不入地进行反革命的活动；他们使用种种令人想像不到的狡猾、诡诈的方法来寻找和扩大他们的反革命的阵地。这种伪装的、善于运用两面手法的阴谋组织的破坏行为，实在使人不寒而栗。
    今天，胡风反党集团的阴谋的揭露，是我们同敌人作斗争中取得的胜利。中国文联和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议已经通过了处理胡风反党集团阴谋事件的决议。这个决议是完全正确的。但是这场斗争并没有结束，我们要继续彻底追查胡风及其反党集团的反革命罪行，同时要牢牢地记住这次阴谋事件的经验教训，提高警惕，加强团结，把一切混到我们队伍里来的破坏分子清除出去，把暗藏在各个角落的破坏分子追寻出来！（原载“大公报”）
