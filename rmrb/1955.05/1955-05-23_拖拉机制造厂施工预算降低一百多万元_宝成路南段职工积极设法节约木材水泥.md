Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd – The Engineering Bureau undertaking the construction of the tractor factory recently revised its construction plan for this year. By adopting many cost-reducing measures, the cost of factory building construction, welfare facilities, and other projects for the tractor factory this year will be reduced by more than 1.43 million yuan compared to the original construction budget approved by the state.

According to the revised construction plan, a total of eighteen technical and organizational measures to reduce engineering costs have been adopted this year. One of the effective measures is the adoption of mechanized and factory-based construction. For example, if wood used for various projects is centrally processed at a timber processing plant, timber waste can be reduced by more than 590 cubic meters compared to decentralized processing, saving the state more than 92,000 yuan. Centralized processing of steel bars can also reduce waste by more than 500 tons. Using vibrators to compact concrete can save a total of more than 640 tons of 300-grade and 400-grade cement compared to manual compaction, with a value of 56,600 yuan. The cost reduction due to increased labor productivity from the use of various machines will be even greater. Promoting various advanced construction experiences is also an important measure to reduce engineering costs. Simply by using standardized templates in concrete projects and increasing the number of times the templates are used, more than 92,800 yuan can be saved. In addition, transportation management fees, administrative management fees, and machinery usage fees are also much lower than originally budgeted.

Some auxiliary projects such as the welfare facilities and other related projects for the tractor factory undertaken by this engineering bureau have recently started construction; the factory buildings will begin construction in the second half of this year. Currently, a large portion of the cost reduction measures in this engineering bureau's construction plan for this year have already been implemented.

Xinhua News Agency – Workers building the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway have devised many ways to save timber and cement. Due to the Seventh Engineering Section's attention to timber protection, all the timber they have used from January to now is timber that was used last year. Before the start of construction this year, the section from slightly north of Lueyang to the Huangsha River needed a large amount of timber to build work sheds and dormitories. After discussion among the workers, it was decided to use relatively inexpensive and easily purchased moso bamboo instead of timber. Currently, 140,000 bamboo poles have been purchased from various places, which are expected to save 7,000 cubic meters of timber. In engineering, in addition to continuing to promote engineer Wu Cheng-san's suggestion of not driving piles for bridge foundations this year, the method of using steel arches instead of wooden arches to build stone arch bridges and excavate tunnels has recently been promoted, which is also expected to save a large amount of timber.

This year, the suggestion made by engineer Song Hanou to mix stones into ordinary concrete to save cement has been widely used on various construction sites. The section from slightly north of Lueyang to the Huangsha River originally lacked stone quarries, but after months of searching by the workers, three mountain areas capable of quarrying stone were finally discovered in March of this year. It is estimated that the establishment of just one stone quarry in May can produce 30,000 cubic meters of stone, which can save 10,000 tons of cement for this section of the project. This year, advanced methods such as the "rubble squeezing slurry method" have also been vigorously promoted at various construction sites. After a squad of the Seventh Engineering Section used the "rubble squeezing slurry method" to install rubble, they saved 107 tons of cement in five months.

　　拖拉机制造厂施工预算降低一百多万元
　  宝成路南段职工积极设法节约木材水泥
    新华社二十二日讯　承建拖拉机制造厂的工程局最近在修订今年施工计划时，由于采取许多降低成本的措施，使拖拉机制造厂今年的厂房建筑、福利建筑和其他方面工程的成本，比原来国家批准的施工预算节约了一百四十三万多元。
    根据修订过的施工计划，今年采取降低工程成本的技术组织措施共有十八项。其中有效的措施之一是采用机械化和工厂化施工。如各种工程用的木材经集中到木材加工厂统一加工以后，木材的损耗就可以比分散加工时减少五百九十多立方公尺，可以为国家节约九万二千多元。钢筋集中加工后，减少的损耗也可以有五百多吨。用震荡器捣固混凝土，比手工捣固能节约三百标号和四百标号的水泥共六百四十多吨，价值达五万六千六百多元。因使用各种机械提高了劳动生产率而降低的成本费用，就将更大。推广各种先进的施工经验，也是降低工程成本的一个重要措施。仅在混凝土工程上采用定型模板、并把模板使用的次数增加，就可节约九万二千八百多元。此外，在运输管理费、行政管理费和机械使用费方面，也比原来预算的减少很多。
    这个工程局承建的拖拉机制造厂福利建筑和其他方面的一些附属工程，已在最近开工；厂房将在今年下半年开工兴建。现在，这个工程局今年施工计划上的降低成本的措施，有很大一部分已经开始实施。
    新华社讯　修建宝成铁路南段的职工们想出许多办法节约木材和水泥。第七工程段的职工由于注意木材的保护，他们从今年一月到现在所用的木材，全部是去年用过的木材。略阳以北到黄沙河段，今年开工前需要大量木材修建工棚、宿舍，经职工们研究后，决定用比较价廉而又容易购买的楠竹代替木材。现在从各地买来的楠竹已有十四万根，预计可以节约七千立方公尺木材。在工程上，今年除继续推行工程师吴成三的修桥基不打桩的建议以外，最近又在推行用钢拱架代替木拱架修建石拱桥和开凿隧道的办法，预计也可以节约大量木材。
    今年，各修建工地上已普遍使用工程师宋涵欧提出的在一般混凝土中掺用石块以节约水泥的建议。略阳以北到黄沙河段本来缺乏供开采的料石，但经过职工们数月寻找，今年三月终于发现了能开料石的山场三处。预计仅五月份建立的一个料石场，就能出石料三万立方公尺，可以使这段工程节约水泥一万吨。今年，各工地还大力推广“片石挤浆法”等先进方法。第七工程段一个中队用“片石挤浆法”安砌片石后，五个月节约水泥一百零七吨。
