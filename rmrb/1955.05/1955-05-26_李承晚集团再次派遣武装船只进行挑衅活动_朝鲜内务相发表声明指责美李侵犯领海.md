Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 25th. According to the Korean Central News Agency: The Minister of Interior of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on May 25th regarding the continued intrusion of South Korean armed vessels into the Republic's territorial waters near Haeju, Hwanghae Province.

The statement said: Despite the fact that the spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior of the Republic issued a statement on the 18th, lodging a serious warning against the South Korean armed vessels' actions of intruding into the Republic's territorial waters under the direct cover of the US military, the Li Seung-man clique, on May 20th and 21st, again used peaceful fishing boats as a smokescreen and dispatched a large number of armed vessels to the Republic's territorial waters to carry out serious provocative activities.

The purpose of the Li Seung-man clique in carrying out these provocative actions is to use innocent fishermen as cover to stealthily send armed agents and pirates into the Republic's territory.

The statement emphatically pointed out: If the US side and the Li Seung-man puppet clique again take actions to intrude into the territorial waters of the northern part of the Republic, the Republic's coast guard will take appropriate measures for self-defense, and the US side and the Li Seung-man clique will bear full responsibility for the consequences arising therefrom.

At the same time, the Minister of Interior of the Republic also declared the release of those genuine fishermen who have been found to have been arrested because they were used as cover by South Korean armed agents, and permitted South Korean fishermen to fish in certain fishing grounds in the Republic's northern territorial waters during the yellow croaker fishing season, in accordance with the regulations formulated by the Ministry of Interior of the Republic.

　　李承晚集团再次派遣武装船只进行挑衅活动
　  朝鲜内务相发表声明指责美李侵犯领海
    新华社平壤二十五日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内务相二十五日就南朝鲜武装船只继续侵犯黄海南道海州附近共和国领海事件发表声明。
    声明说：尽管共和国内务省发言人已在十八日发表声明，对南朝鲜武装船只在美军直接掩护下侵犯共和国领海的行为提出了严重警告，李承晚集团在五月二十日和二十一日又利用和平渔船作为烟幕，派遣了一大批武装船只到共和国领海进行严重的挑衅活动。
    李承晚集团进行这种挑衅行为的目的，是以无辜渔民为掩护，来偷派武装特务和海盗进入共和国领土。
    声明强调指出：如果美方和李承晚傀儡集团再度采取侵犯共和国北部领海的行动，共和国海岸警备队将采取适当的措施来进行自卫，而美方和李承晚集团将要对由此产生的后果负全部责任。
    同时，共和国内务相还声明释放那些已经查明因被南朝鲜武装特务用作掩护而被捕的真正的渔民，并且准许南朝鲜渔民根据共和国内务省制定的条例，在捕黄鱼季节里在共和国北部领海某些捕鱼场捕鱼。
