　　Full-Scale Construction of Building and Installation Projects on the Jining-Erlian Railway
    The Jining-Erlian Railway, which completed track laying in 1954, will be built into an international railway with the latest equipment in our country. At present, large-scale building and installation projects along the Jining-Erlian Railway are under full-scale construction. A large number of workers are building new buildings on both sides of the railway, and the sound of water supply engineering teams using machines to explore water sources and drill wells echoes along the line. Construction workers who recently arrived at stations such as Erlian, which is near the border, have already excavated the foundations for station buildings and other projects there.
    According to the construction plan that has been prepared, the Jining-Erlian Railway will install hundreds of new types of machinery for locomotive, rolling stock, and electrical engineering this year. Many of these machines are appearing on our country's railways for the first time. For example, after the installation of wireless dispatching equipment at the stations, dispatchers will be able to directly direct the operation of locomotives within the station through this equipment. Active block signal devices will also be installed at twenty-one stations along the line this year, and several technically complex water supply projects will be completed. In addition, the construction of station yards, factories, warehouses, residential buildings, and many complex upper structures of the line will continue to be completed throughout the line.

　　集二线建筑安装工程全面施工
    一九五四年已经完成铺轨的集二线，将建设成为我国拥有最新式设备的一条国际联运铁路。目前，集二线沿线上的大规模建筑安装工程已经全面施工。大批工人正在铁路两旁建设新的建筑物，沿线上回响着给水工程队用机器钻探水源和穿凿水井的声音。不久前才到达临近国境的二连等车站的建筑工人，已经挖好了那里的站房等工程的基础。
    根据已经编制好的施工计划，集二线今年要安装几百种机务、车务、电务等方面的新型机械。其中许多机械是我国铁路线上第一次出现的。如车站上安装好无线调度装置后，调度人员就可通过这个装置直接指挥站内机车运行。全线今年还要安装好二十一个站的主动闭塞信号装置、完成几处技术复杂的给水工程。此外，全线还要继续完成站场、厂房、仓库、住宅等建筑工程和许多复杂的线路上部建筑。　（新华社）
