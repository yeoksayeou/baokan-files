We communists possess lofty revolutionary ideals and a new type of noble morality dedicated to serving these great ideals. Lenin taught that the old society's exploitative system demanded that people become "individuals concerned only with themselves and disregarding others" from childhood. Communists, however, must resolutely oppose this behavior, mentality, and emotion of harming others for personal gain, as it only benefits the exploitative system and is extremely detrimental to the struggle to consolidate and complete the socialist cause. For communists, "morality is to help human society rise to a higher level, liberating human society from the system of labor exploitation." Similarly, in his article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Comrade Mao Zedong also discussed the moral character of communists, sharply criticizing the non-communist attitude of being "indifferent, cold, and apathetic towards comrades and the people, instead of being full of enthusiasm." He said, "We must all learn from his spirit of utter selflessness. Starting from this point, one can become a person of great benefit to the people. A person's ability may be great or small, but as long as one possesses this spirit, one is a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who has transcended vulgar interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people." For many years, the vast majority of our party members, in order to realize the noble aspiration of communism, have not only demonstrated a spirit of full enthusiasm and diligent service to the people in the revolutionary cause, but also maintained the fine traditions of self-discipline, dedication to public service, and hard work and plain living in their personal daily lives, treating public interests and public property, society and family, labor and rest with a communist attitude. The famous "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" stipulated by our Party in the People's Liberation Army it leads also embodies the communist moral principles. The noble moral standards of communists have greatly moved the masses. People in the past originally thought that any political party would become corrupt and degenerate after seizing power, but they have seen a completely different situation in the ranks of the Communist Party. More and more working people and educated youth are determined to change their old habits, strive to emulate the moral standards of communists, and outstanding model figures are constantly emerging among them. With the political, economic, and cultural progress of the entire society, communist morality is playing a great role in transforming customs and habits, becoming one of the important forces in promoting the cause of socialist construction.

However, since the struggle for communist morality is a link in the class struggle, it, like the entire class struggle, will never be simple and smooth. Lenin said in his book "Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder": "The force of habit of millions and tens of millions is a most terrible force." Even after the complete elimination of classes, the force of habit of class society will remain for a long time. Moreover, the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie still exist in our country today, and together they still account for the vast majority of the population. Under these conditions, the widespread dissemination of communist morality among the working people will inevitably be subject to various restrictions and resistance, and even the advanced ranks of the working class will inevitably be subject to the corrosive influence of non-working-class, especially bourgeois, lifestyles. The fact that the vast majority of our party members adhere to communist moral principles, and the fact that our party persists in conducting communist education for all communist party members, cannot prevent a very small number of backward party members from being tempted by the bourgeois lifestyle. These party members pursue personal enjoyment, regardless of social losses and the suffering of others. Comrade Liu Shaoqi gave a detailed description of such people in his book "How to Be a Good Communist." "The minds of such people are permeated with the ideological consciousness of the exploiting classes. They even believe in such words as: 'If a man does not act for himself, heaven and earth will destroy him,' 'Man is a selfish and self-interested animal,' 'There will never be truly selfless people in the world, or they are fools and idiots.'" Indeed, some of these party members have already been completely conquered by bourgeois ideological consciousness, moving towards corruption and degeneration, and completely losing the qualifications of a communist party member. In order to purify the party ranks, we must seriously struggle against these degenerate elements and class dissidents who have infiltrated the party, and raise our vigilance to expose and criticize the erosion of our party by the bourgeois lifestyle at any time.

We communists never oppose improving people's material enjoyment, and we never advocate that people be satisfied with poverty and simplicity. On the contrary, our past sacrifices and struggles and our current arduous construction are precisely for the purpose of enabling everyone to live the most prosperous and happiest life. When the day of the realization of our revolutionary final goal of communism arrives, it will be the time when all the people can enjoy a high degree of material civilization. But we communists should have such a clear concept: the improvement of life must be subordinate to the development of production, and the improvement of the lives of party and state workers must be subordinate to the improvement of the living standards of all the people. However, some party members believe that revolution is for their personal happiness, and therefore seek pleasure at all costs; they want to live in the best houses, ride in the newest cars; they want to reimburse a large sum of money for every business trip and every meeting; they frequently send off and welcome guests, host lavish banquets, and spend lavishly, regardless of whether it is necessary; they do not distinguish between public and private matters, and report private expenses as public expenses, and even harm the public to benefit themselves, using national construction funds for the living and welfare expenses of a few people; they pay attention to ostentation and extravagance in the construction of office buildings, with no heart for cherishing the people's property. For example, the Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry, under the leadership of Director Zhu Chuan, in order to pursue ostentation, even violated financial regulations and allocated more than 26,000 yuan from operating funds to renovate sofas, buy new desks, leather swivel chairs, steel wire beds, etc. In February of this year, the Department of Industry convened a local industry conference, and the Provincial People's Committee approved only one movie to be shown, but during the twelve-day conference, they watched four movies and three operas, and secretly reimbursed 400 yuan for each opera under the name of "enterprise bonus." They wasted construction funds and violated national laws, seriously endangering the interests of the Party and the people. Therefore, they must be subject to due punishment by the Party and state organs.

Communists must adopt a comrade-like attitude towards women. This is one of the fundamental political principles of the Communist Party and the working class. Marx and Engels pointed out in the Communist Manifesto long ago that treating wives as tools is the position of the bourgeoisie. Lenin, in his conversation with Clara Zetkin, emphasized that sexual licentiousness is completely anti-Marxist, anti-proletarian, and anti-social. Lenin believed that "love involves the lives of two people, and will produce a third life, a new life. This is what makes love a social relationship and generates responsibility to society." These great principles of Marxism-Leninism guide the thoughts and actions of communists and working people in all countries. After the founding of New China, in addition to actively protecting the rights and interests of women in various economic measures, our Party and government also formulated the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, ensuring that men and women can establish a happy love and a happy family on the basis of freedom and equality, and ensuring that women's rights in marriage and family life are protected by law. The vast majority of our party members treat marriage and family issues in accordance with the Marriage Law. They base their love on a common political understanding, so the relationship between husband and wife is loyal and close, and they are full of vigor in their work. However, a small number of people who have been tainted with bourgeois consciousness fundamentally violate communist morality. They treat women as objects to be played with and used, do not regard their wives as partners in a common cause, do not pay attention to their work and study, and once they are tired of them, they attack, abandon, and even persecute them by shameful means. For example, Ma Haotian, the former deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Yunnan Provincial People's Government, who was expelled from the Party by the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in September last year, used various means to abuse his wife, attempted to instruct his guards to frame her, and secretly cohabited with the daughter of a landlord. In order to achieve his despicable goals, he did not hesitate to deceive the Party organization, openly abandoned his work, and busied himself with his secretive "private affairs." It is completely correct and necessary to expel such degenerate elements who betray communist principles from the Party in order to maintain the new morality and new atmosphere.

There are many aspects and methods by which the bourgeois lifestyle erodes the revolutionary ranks. Embezzlement and theft of public property, deception of the Party and the people, rude and cold attitudes towards laborers and comrades, vulgar tastes in cultural and recreational life, religious superstition, and other such dirty things are all reflections of the lifestyle of the exploiting classes. In order to adhere to communist morality, it is necessary to struggle against these dirty things that have mixed into the Party.

In order to oppose the erosion of the bourgeois lifestyle, our Party has conducted and is conducting serious struggles. The successive rectification movements and party consolidation work, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in 1952, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in February 1954, and the National Congress of the Party in March 1955, have all severely cracked down on the erosion of the bourgeois lifestyle. The establishment of the central and local discipline inspection commissions of the Party will provide constant and strong support for this struggle.

Obviously, opposing the pursuit of a bourgeois lifestyle by a small number of communist party members is a serious class struggle. However, some people in our Party believe that this kind of corruption is a "minor matter in life" and "need not be interfered with." This view is actually a bourgeois liberalist viewpoint. It is the best cover for the erosion of our Party by the bourgeois lifestyle. Of course, the Party does not arbitrarily interfere in the personal lives of party members. The Party allows party members to establish their personal and even family lives within the scope of not violating the interests of the Party. However, are those who abandon the class stand of communist party members, corrupt communist morality, waste state property, and harm revolutionary comrades and revolutionary work in order to pursue the sordid bourgeois lifestyle not violating the interests of the Party? Is it not a fact that those who are permeated with bourgeois habits in their personal lives are extremely likely to gradually become indifferent to the revolutionary cause, show fatigue with the style of hard struggle, and become spiritually alienated from the Party and the people, until they completely break away from the Party and the people and roll into the cesspool of schemers and traitors? Therefore, the daily lives of party members must never be completely separated from political issues, and we must never turn a blind eye to the serious erosion of communist party members by the bourgeois lifestyle.

We communists shoulder the great mission of breaking the old world and creating a new world, and for this reason, we also shoulder the great mission of opposing old ideas and old morality and establishing new ideas and new morality. Our opposition to the erosion of the Party and the revolutionary ranks by bourgeois ideology from life is precisely the struggle of this new ideology and morality against the old ideology and morality. Therefore, party organizations at all levels must recognize the serious significance of this struggle, assume the task of leading this struggle, and educate party members and cadres to improve their political sensitivity and strengthen their ideological awareness and moral character. Those who persist in their mistakes and refuse to change should be subjected to disciplinary action, and even expelled from the Party when necessary. Only in this way can we maintain the pure and noble communist spirit of our Party and the revolutionary ranks, thereby further changing social customs and promoting the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland.

### 反对资产阶级生活方式对革命队伍的侵蚀

　　反对资产阶级生活方式对革命队伍的侵蚀
    我们共产主义者具有伟大的革命理想，具有为这伟大理想服务的新型的高尚的道德。列宁曾教导说：旧社会的剥削制度要求人从小时就成为一个“只关心自己而不顾及旁人的人”，而共产主义者却要坚决反对这种损人利己的行为、心理和情绪，因为这只是对剥削制度有利，而对巩固和完成社会主义事业的斗争极端不利的。对于共产主义者来说，“道德就是要帮助人类社会升到更高的水准，使人类社会摆脱劳动剥削制”。同样，毛泽东同志在“纪念白求恩”一文中也谈到共产主义者的道德面貌，尖锐地批判了那种
  “对同志对人民不是满腔热忱，而是冷冷清清，漠不关心，麻木不仁”的非共产主义态度。他说：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”多年来，我们党的绝大多数党员为了实现共产主义这个崇高的愿望，不但在革命事业上表现满腔热忱勤勤恳恳地为人民服务的精神，同时在个人日常生活上也保持克己奉公、艰苦朴素的优良传统，用共产主义的态度来对待公共利益和公共财产，对待社会和家庭，对待劳动和休息。党在自己所领导的人民解放军中所规定的著名的“三大纪律，八项注意”，同样贯彻了共产主义的道德原则。共产党员这种高尚的道德标准，大大地感动了人民群众。人们在过去原来以为任何政党掌握政权以后总是会腐化堕落的，但是他们在共产党的队伍里却看到完全不同的情形。愈来愈多的劳动人民和知识青年决心改变自己的旧习惯，努力向共产主义者的道德标准看齐，在他们中间不断地涌现卓越的模范人物。共产主义的道德随着整个社会的政治上、经济上、文化上的进步，正在起着伟大的移风易俗的作用，成为推进社会主义建设事业的重要力量之一。
    但是，为共产主义道德的斗争既然是阶级斗争的一个环节，它就像整个阶级斗争一样，决不会是简单的，一帆风顺的。列宁在“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”一书中曾说：“千百万人的习惯势力是最可怕的势力。”就在阶级完全消灭以后，阶级社会的习惯势力还会遗留很久；何况今天资产阶级和小资产阶级还在我国存在着，他们合起来还占人口的绝大多数，在这种条件下共产主义道德在劳动人民中的广泛传布不可免地要受到种种限制和抵抗，甚至工人阶级的先进队伍也不可免地要受到非工人阶级的特别是资产阶级的生活方式的腐蚀性的影响。我们党的绝大多数党员坚持共产主义道德原则的事实，我们党坚持向全体共产党员进行共产主义教育的事实，并不能使极少数落后的党员不受资产阶级生活方式的引诱。这些党员追求个人享受，不管社会的损失和旁人的痛苦。刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”一书中对这种人曾有详细的描写。“这种人的脑筋，浸透着剥削阶级的思想意识。他甚至相信这样的话：‘人不为己，天诛地灭’，‘人是自私自利的动物’‘世界上不会有真正大公无私的人，或者那是蠢才与傻瓜’。”的确，在这些党员中有些人就已经完全被资产阶级的思想意识征服，走向了腐化堕落的境地，完全丧失了共产党员的条件。为了纯洁党的队伍，我们必须严肃地向这些堕落分子以及混入党内的阶级异己分子作斗争，并且提高警惕，随时揭穿并批判资产阶级生活方式对我们的侵蚀。
    我们共产党人决不反对提高人们的物质享受，决不提倡人们满足于贫困和简陋的生活，恰恰相反，我们过去的牺牲奋斗和现在的艰苦建设正是为了人人都过最富裕最幸福的生活。到了我们革命的最后目标共产主义实现之日，也就是全体人民都能享受高度的物质文明之时。但是我们共产党人应当有这样一个明确的观念：生活的改善必须服从于生产的发展，党和国家工作人员生活的改善，必须服从于全体人民生活水平的提高。但是有些党员却以为革命就是为了他们个人的幸福，因而不顾一切地贪图享乐；房子要住最好的，汽车要坐最新的；出一次差，开一次会，要报销一大笔钱；他们不分必要与否，经常送往迎来，大宴宾客，挥霍无度；他们公私不分，把私费报为公用，甚至损公肥私，把国家建设资金用于少数人生活福利的支出；他们对机关房屋的建设，讲究排场，追求阔气，毫无爱惜人民财产之心。例如辽宁省工业厅在厅长朱川同志领导之下，为了讲究排场，甚至违反财政制度，从事业费中拨出人民币两万六千多元来大修沙发，买新的办公桌、皮转椅、钢丝床等。今年二月，工业厅召开地方工业会议，省人民委员会批准只招待一次电影，但是开会十二天就看了四次电影和三次戏，看一次戏就偷偷报销“企业奖励金”四百元。他们浪费了建设资金，破坏了国家法律，严重地危害了党和人民的利益，因此，他们必须受到党和国家机关应有的惩处。
    共产党人对待妇女必须采取同志的态度，这是共产党和工人阶级的根本政治原则之一。马克思和恩格斯在共产党宣言中早已指出，把妻子当作工具看待就是资产阶级的立场。列宁在同蔡特金谈话时，着重指出性的放纵是完全反马克思主义的，反无产阶级的，并且是反社会的。列宁认为，“恋爱牵涉到两个人的生命，并且会产生第三个生命，一个新的生命。这才使恋爱具有社会关系，并产生对社会的责任。”马克思列宁主义的这些伟大的原则，指导着世界各国共产主义者和劳动人民的思想和行动。新中国成立以后，我们的党和政府除在各种经济措施上积极保护妇女的权益以外，还制定了中华人民共和国婚姻法，保证男女可以在自由平等的基础上建立美满的爱情和幸福的家庭，保证妇女在婚姻和家庭生活中的权利受到法律的保护。我们党的绝大多数党员对待婚姻和家庭问题是符合婚姻法的。他们把自己的爱情建立在共同的政治认识的基础上，因此他们夫妻间的关系是忠诚的、亲密的，他们在劳动中也充满着朝气勃勃的活力。但是少数沾染了资产阶级意识的人，却根本违反共产主义道德。他们把妇女当成玩弄和使用的对象，不把妻子看成共同事业的伴侣，不注意她们的工作和学习，一旦厌恶即加以打击、遗弃，甚至用可耻的手段加以迫害。例如去年九月被中共云南省委开除党籍的前云南省人民政府农林厅副厅长马浩天，就利用各种手段虐待妻子，企图指使他的警卫员来陷害她，并暗中同一个地主女儿姘居。他为了达到他的卑鄙的目的，不惜欺骗党组织，公然抛弃工作，忙于其不可告人的“私事”。把这种背叛共产主义原则的堕落分子开除出党是完全正确的，是维护新道德新风气所必需的。
    资产阶级生活方式侵蚀革命队伍的方面和方法是很多的。对公共财产的贪污盗窃，对党和人民的欺骗，对劳动者和同志的粗野和冷酷的态度，文化娱乐生活中的下流趣味，宗教的迷信，以及诸如此类的肮脏东西，都是剥削阶级生活方式的反映，为了坚持共产主义的道德，就必须同混进党内来的这些肮脏东西作斗争。
    为着反对资产阶级生活方式的侵蚀，我们党曾经进行了并且正在进行着严肃的斗争。历次的整风运动和整党工作，一九五二年的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，一九五四年二月的七届四中全会和一九五五年三月的党的全国代表会议，都严重地打击了资产阶级生活方式的侵蚀。党的中央和地方各级监察委员会的成立将给这一斗争以经常的有力的支持。
    显然，反对少数共产党员追求资产阶级的生活方式是一场严重的阶级斗争。但是在我们党内也有人认为这种腐化的现象是“生活小事”，“不必干涉”。这种看法实际上是资产阶级自由主义观点。它是资产阶级生活方式侵蚀我们党的最好的掩护物。当然，党并不随便干涉党员个人生活。党允许党员在不违背党的利益之范围内，去建立他个人的以至家庭的生活。可是，那些为了追求资产阶级的龌龊的生活方式的人，抛弃共产党员的阶级立场，败坏共产主义道德，浪费国家财产，损害革命同志和革命工作，难道还不违背党的利益吗？在个人生活上浸透了资产阶级习气的人，极容易一步一步地对革命事业冷淡，对艰苦奋斗的作风表示厌倦，对党和人民在精神上疏远，直到完全脱离党和人民，滚到阴谋家和叛徒的粪坑里去，这难道不是事实吗？因此，决不能把党员的日常生活和政治问题完全分开，决不能对共产党员受资产阶级生活方式的严重侵蚀熟视无睹。
    我们共产党人肩负着打破旧世界创造新世界的伟大使命，也为此而肩负着反对旧思想旧道德、树立新思想新道德的伟大使命。我们反对资产阶级思想从生活上对党和革命队伍的侵蚀，正是这种新的思想和道德对于旧的思想和道德的斗争。因此，各级党的组织必须认识这一斗争的严重意义，担负起领导这一斗争的任务，教育党员和干部提高政治嗅觉，加强思想意识和道德品质的修养和锻炼。对于那些坚持错误不改的人，应当实行纪律处分，直至在必要时把他们清除出党。只有这样，才能保持我们党和革命队伍的纯洁高尚的共产主义的精神面貌，从而进一步改变社会风气，促进祖国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业。
