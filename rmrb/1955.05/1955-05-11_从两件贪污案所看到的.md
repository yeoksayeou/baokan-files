What We See From Two Embezzlement Cases
Pan Shouqian

Not long ago, the Beijing People's Court heard an embezzlement case. The defendant was a 22-year-old woman named Liu Shugui, who was originally a saleswoman at the 25th branch of the Xidan District United Consumer Cooperative in Beijing. Starting in October 1953, she included a task in her work schedule that she performed without fail, namely "bringing" a little bit of public property home after work. From October 1953 to September of the following year, she brought money home, and from September to October, she brought cloth. By October 1954, she had "moved" more than 3,000 yuan in cash and 33 pieces of silk and cloth from the cooperative to her own little nest using this "ants moving house" method.

The presiding judge asked the defendant in the public trial: "Aren't you afraid that the organization will find out if you steal like this continuously?" The defendant replied: "I thought they wouldn't find out because the system isn't complete, and there are no inspections."

She wasn't lying. If she hadn't been so bold and arrogant as to stuff eight feet of Kao Fu silk into her chest at a group meeting of more than 20 people, her dirty hand wouldn't have been caught under the kind of system she mentioned.

During the same period, the Xidan District People's Court in Beijing also heard an embezzlement case. The defendant was a woman named Yu Jiuhua, who was also a saleswoman at the 25th branch of the Xidan District United Consumer Cooperative. Her statement in court provided some explanation for Liu Shugui's words. She said: "First, I 'took' 20 yuan from the sales proceeds to plan travel expenses for relatives. I thought I would make it up as soon as I got paid. But later, when I saw that nothing happened, I became bolder. When I was short of money, I would 'take' it. In the second quarter of 1954, I 'took' about 100 yuan of sales proceeds from the stationery department's paper book section. When we took quarterly inventory, the stationery department had a total loss of more than 90 yuan, but our paper book section actually had a surplus of more than 10 yuan. I wondered, what's going on? Is there someone else playing tricks? So I became even bolder. Starting from the third quarter, I 'took' with a plan. Every day before my rest day (Sunday), I would 'take' exactly 10 yuan, no more and no less. That quarter had 13 weeks, so I 'took' a total of 130 yuan. When we took quarterly inventory, although the stationery department lost more than 300 yuan, our paper book section didn't lose any money again. I couldn't figure out what was going on. So, I 'took' 50 yuan at once, and then I 'took' 45 yuan another time..."

Why was it so easy to steal, and why couldn't the public see the deficit after being stolen from?

At the branch where Liu Shugui worked, the salesperson collected the money themselves when selling goods, and then made a mark on the item list. When settling accounts in the evening, they only recorded the amount of money on hand, regardless of what goods were sold. Inventory was only taken once a quarter, and the quantity sold in the entire quarter was estimated based on the remaining quantity of goods. However, the loss rate of many commodities is currently impossible to calculate. This is true not only for local products such as vegetables, fruits, and fresh fish, but even for fabrics from factories, which vary in length from 108 feet, 114 feet, or 106 feet per piece. In this situation, it is impossible to simply "calculate sales based on inventory." Therefore, even if a deficit is discovered, it cannot be determined whether it is due to loss or embezzlement. Embezzlers can then fish in troubled waters and attribute the embezzlement results to losses.

It can be seen from the trial that any loopholes in the system, no matter how small, can be exploited by embezzlers. Some embezzlers take advantage of the fact that banks don't strictly count banknotes and don't investigate responsibility when problems are discovered, so they take one yuan out of every hundred yuan when sending money to the national treasury and put it in their pockets. Some even take advantage of the opportunity to check hygiene in the cooperative's stores and steal items on the sly, seeing that there is money everywhere.

Many embezzlement behaviors can be prevented by simply rectifying the system a little. For example, when the branch where Liu Shugui worked replaced the salesperson collection system with a dedicated cashier system, Liu Shugui had to stop stealing money.

Last September, after summarizing the experience of trying embezzlement cases, the Xidan District People's Court, through the Party's district committee, made suggestions to the Xidan District United Consumer Cooperative on improving the system, strengthening inspection, and strengthening political work. The cooperative accepted the suggestions, discovered more than 100 staff members with theft behavior in less than a month, and began to improve some systems.

People only need to use their brains a little, and loopholes will be seen, and there will always be solutions. It is a pity that many comrades don't like to use their brains very much.

If we want to realize socialism sooner, and if we want our country to be prosperous and civilized, we should often use our brains, pay attention to the loopholes in our work, and think of some ways to plug these loopholes. This is the sense of responsibility that state workers should have, and they should not use this or that as an excuse to delay taking necessary measures. Embezzlement and theft are crimes, and leaving loopholes for embezzlers and thieves and helping them embezzle and steal should also be considered crimes. Because without the barrier of bureaucracy, the hands of thieves can be easily caught.

### 从两件贪污案所看到的

　　从两件贪污案所看到的
　　潘守谦
    不久前，北京市人民法院审理了一件贪污案。被告是一个二十二岁的名叫刘淑贵的妇女，原在北京市西单区联合消费合作社第二十五分销处当业务员。她从一九五三年十月起在自己的工作日程里规定了一项风雨无阻的任务，就是在下班的时候“捎”点公家东西回家。从一九五三年十月到次年九月是捎钱，从九月到十月是捎布。她这种“蚂蚁搬家”的办法，到一九五四年十月，已经从合作社搬了三千多元现款和三十三块绸缎和布到自家的小窠里了。
    审判长在公判庭上问被告：“你这样连续不断地偷，不怕组织上发觉吗？”被告回答：“我想，他们是不会发觉的。因为制度不全，又不检查。”
    她没有说谎。如果不是她自己大胆狂妄到在二十多人的小组会上把八尺考府绸往胸口里塞，她的那只龌龊的手是不会在她所指的那种制度底下被捉住的。
    同一时期，北京市西单区人民法院也审理了一件贪污案。被告是个名叫于久华的妇女，也在西单区联合消费合作社第二十五分销处当业务员。她在法庭上的陈述，恰好给刘淑贵的话作了若干说明。她说：“先是因为给亲戚筹划路费，在售货款里‘拿’了二十元。心想一发薪就补上。但后来见没有动静，胆子便大了。缺钱，便‘拿’。在一九五四年第二季度大约‘拿’了文具部纸本组一百元售货款。季度盘货时，文具部总的亏了九十多元，但我们纸本组反而多出十几元。我想，这是怎么回事呢？是不是还有别人在做鬼呢？于是胆子更大了。从第三季度开始，便有计划地‘拿’。每当休息的前一日（星期日），就准‘拿’十元，不多‘拿’也不少‘拿’。那个季度是十三个星期，共‘拿’了一百三十元。季度盘货时，虽然文具部亏了三百多元，但我们纸本组又没有亏钱。我也弄不清是怎么回事。于是，就一次‘拿’了五十元，后来又一次‘拿’了四十五元……。”
    为什么这么容易偷，而且公家在被偷之后又看不见亏空呢？
    在刘淑贵所在的那个分销处，售货员卖东西，是自己收款，收款以后再在物品单上划一记号。晚上结账时，只记现有钱数，不管是卖了什么东西的钱。一个季度才盘一次货，根据剩下的商品数量来推算整个季度出售的数量。但是，目前有许多商品的损耗率是无从计算的。不仅像蔬菜、水果、鲜鱼等土产如此；甚至出自工厂的布，每匹或一○八尺，或一一四尺，或一○六尺，也很不一致。在这种情况下，是不可能单纯“以存计销”的。所以，就算发现了亏空，也不能断定是由于损耗，还是由于贪污。贪污分子遂得混水摸鱼，把贪污结果推之于损耗。
    从审判中可以看到：制度上的任何漏洞，不管怎么小，都有被贪污分子利用的可能。贪污分子们有的利用银行不严格数票、发现了问题不追究责任的现象，便在往国库送款时从每一百元里面抽出一元，纳入腰包。有的见合作社门市部里随处是钱，便甚至利用检查卫生的机会顺手牵羊。
    许多贪污行为，只要把制度稍稍整顿一下便可以防止。例如，当刘淑贵所在的分销处用专人收款制代替了售货员收款制以后，刘淑贵就不得不停止偷钱了。
    去年九月，北京市西单区人民法院在总结了审判贪污案件的经验以后，通过党的区委会向西单区联合消费合作社提出了健全制度、加强检查、加强政治工作的建议。这个社接受了建议，在不到一个月的时间里查出了一百多个有盗窃行为的工作人员，并开始改进一些制度。
    人们只要稍为动动脑子，漏洞就会看见，办法也总是有的。可惜有不少同志就是不大爱动脑筋。
    如果我们想望早些实现社会主义，想望我们国家富强文明，我们就应该时常动动脑筋，注意一下工作中的漏洞，想一些办法出来把这些漏洞堵塞一下。这是国家工作人员应有的责任感，不应该借口这个那个来拖延采取必要的措施。贪污盗窃是犯罪，给贪污盗窃分子留下漏洞、助长他们贪污盗窃，同样应该被认为是犯罪。因为如果没有官僚主义这个屏障，盗贼的手是很容易被捉住的。
