　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama answered questions regarding Sino-Japanese trade issues at a meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 6th.

　　Hatoyama mentioned that representatives of the League of Diet Members for Promoting Japan-China Trade had requested him to sign a memorandum promoting the development of Japan-China trade on April 27th. Hatoyama said, "I see no reason to oppose such a movement, so I signed it." Hatoyama said that he believed the gist of the memorandum he signed was the same as the Sino-Japanese trade agreement signed on May 4th. However, he also said, "Although I said I would assist with the memorandum of the League of Diet Members for Promoting Japan-China Trade, I did not say I would support the written trade agreement."

　　Hatoyama also said: "In order to develop trade with China, the embargo restrictions of the Paris Coordinating Committee must be lifted."

　　鸠山谈中日贸易问题
    新华社七日讯　东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎六日在众议院预算委员会会议上，答复有关中日贸易问题的质询。
    鸠山谈到日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟的代表在四月二十七日以一份促进日中贸易发展的备忘录要求他签字。鸠山说，“我看没有理由去反对这样一种运动，因此我签了字。”鸠山说，他认为他签字的那份备忘录和五月四日签订的中日贸易协定的要旨是一样的。但是，他又说，“我虽然对国会议员促进日中贸易联盟的备忘录说过予以协助的话，但是我没有对贸易协定的成文说过予以支持的话。”
    鸠山又说：“为了发展同中国的贸易，必须取消巴黎统筹委员会的禁运限制。”
