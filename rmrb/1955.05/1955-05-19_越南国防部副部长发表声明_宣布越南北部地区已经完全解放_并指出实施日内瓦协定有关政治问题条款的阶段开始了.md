    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 17th: Xie Guangbao, Deputy Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, held a press conference in Hanoi on the afternoon of the 16th.

    Xie Guangbao issued a statement on behalf of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, reviewing the results of the implementation of the armistice agreement in the past ten months. The statement pointed out that the work of transferring troops by both sides has been completed, "Thus, an important stage in the implementation of the Geneva Accords has been completed, and the stage of direct struggle to implement the relevant political provisions has begun."

    The statement said: "This is a major victory for the Vietnamese people and peace-loving people all over the world. With the completion of the takeover of the Haiphong area, the northern region is now completely liberated, providing a solid foundation for the struggle to thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete the national independence and democracy."

    Xie Guangbao then answered some questions raised by Vietnamese and foreign journalists.

    In response to a question about the repeated acts of infringement on the democratic freedoms of the people in South Vietnam, he said that the International Commission had conducted several investigations into this issue and had repeatedly concluded that the other party had violated the armistice agreement.

    A foreign journalist raised a question about the suggestion to extend the deadline for the migration of residents. Xie Guangbao pointed out that this suggestion has no legal basis. He said that the Vietnamese people have the right to move freely and settle in any part of their country not only within the 300-day period but also in the days to come. He pointed out that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam not only strictly implements Article 14D of the Geneva Accords, but also proposes suggestions on rebuilding normal relations between North and South Vietnam and on ensuring that every Vietnamese citizen enjoys freedom of movement. If people sincerely value the freedom of movement of the people, they will accept this reasonable suggestion from the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Xie Guangbao spoke about the United States' interference in South Vietnam and said: The Geneva Accords prohibit South Vietnam from participating in any military alliance and serving an aggressive policy. Bringing South Vietnam into the protected area of ​​the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the activities of the Collins Mission have in fact placed this area into a military alliance. This constitutes a serious violation of Article 19 of the Geneva Accords and Article 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference.

    In response to questions about political consultation meetings and the holding of free general elections, Xie Guangbao recounted Article 7 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. This article stipulates that, starting from July 20, 1955, the responsible authorities with representatives from both regions should conduct consultations to discuss the issue of holding free general elections scheduled for July 1956. He pointed out that this article was put forward after the sixth article of the final declaration confirmed that the military demarcation line was temporary. He also said that Articles 11 and 12 of the final declaration mentioned that the participating countries of the Geneva Conference guarantee to respect the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Vietnam, and not to interfere in its internal affairs. Xie Guangbao then said: In this way, the issues of consultation meetings and general elections stipulated in the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference should be resolved. We are determined to fight for the earnest fulfillment of these provisions.

　　越南国防部副部长发表声明
　　宣布越南北部地区已经完全解放
　　并指出实施日内瓦协定有关政治问题条款的阶段开始了
    新华社河内十七日电　越南民主共和国国防部副部长谢光宝十六日下午在河内举行记者招待会。
    谢光宝以越南人民军总司令部的名义发表了一个声明，声明中回顾了过去十个月中执行停战协定的结果。声明指出，双方转移军队的工作已经完成，“这样，在执行日内瓦协定方面的一个重要阶段已经完成了，为实施有关政治问题的条款而进行直接斗争的阶段开始了。”
    声明说：“这是越南人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民的一个重大胜利。随着接管海防地区的工作的完成，北部地区现在已经完全解放，并为争取彻底实施日内瓦协定以巩固和平、实现统一并完成全国的独立和民主的斗争，提供了一个稳固的基础。”
    谢光宝接着回答了越南和外国的记者们提出的一些问题。
    他在回答关于南越一再发生的侵犯人民民主自由行为的问题时说，国际委员会已经就这一问题进行了几次调查，并好几次得出结论说，对方违反了停战协议。
    一个外国记者提出关于延长居民迁移期限建议的问题，谢光宝指出，这个建议是没有法律根据的。他说，越南人民不仅在三百天的期限内而且在将来的日子里也都有权自由地行动和在他们国家的任何地方定居下来。他指出，越南民主共和国政府不仅严格地执行日内瓦协定第十四条丁款，而且还提出关于重建北越和南越之间的正常关系和关于保证每个越南公民享有行动自由的建议。如果人们真诚地重视人民的行动自由，他们就会接受越南民主共和国政府的这一合理建议。
    谢光宝谈到美国对南越的干涉时说：日内瓦协定禁止南越参加任何军事联盟及服务于侵略政策。把南越纳入东南亚条约组织的保护地区和柯林斯使团的活动，事实上已经把这个地区置入一个军事联盟。这构成了对日内瓦协定第十九条和日内瓦会议最后宣言第五条的严重破坏。
    谢光宝在答复关于政治协商会议和举行自由普选的问题时，追述了日内瓦会议最后宣言第七条。这一条规定，自一九五五年七月二十日起，双方地区有代表性的负责当局应进行协商，以讨论预定在一九五六年七月举行自由普选的问题。他指出，这一条是在最后宣言确认军事分界线是临时性的第六条之后提出的。他又说，最后宣言的第十一条和第十二条提到日内瓦会议的各个与会国保证尊重越南的主权、独立、统一和领土完整，并对其内政不予任何干涉。谢光宝接着说：这样，日内瓦会议最后宣言中所规定的协商会议和普选这两个问题应该是解决了。我们决心为认真地履行这些规定而斗争。
