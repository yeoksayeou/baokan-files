　　Anhui Completes Repair of Embankments Along the Yangtze River

    The Anhui Province’s Yangtze River main embankment and the inland river embankments along the Yangtze River have been victoriously completed. The repaired river and embankments have been universally strengthened and thickened, providing safe protection for 8.3 million mu of farmland in high-yield grain areas along the Yangtze River, as well as for the cities, factories, and transportation along the river.
    The embankment repair project in the Yangtze River area of Anhui Province began in December 1954. The entire project was divided into two construction phases: winter repair and spring repair. Due to heavy snowfall during the winter repair phase, only 6.6 percent of the total task was completed. During the spring repair phase, there was continuous rain and snow. In order to complete the embankment repair project on schedule, the laborers, with their selfless labor enthusiasm of not stopping work in light rain and starting work as soon as the rain stopped, launched a large-scale labor competition, which greatly accelerated the progress of the project. The laborers of Guangji Embankment in Huaining County created the “fast ramming method” and the “two-layer soil spreading for one layer of earth” method, which doubled work efficiency and improved the quality of ramming.
    During the repair of the Yangtze River main embankment and the inland river embankments along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province, strong support was received from the state and people from all over the country. The state allocated 40 million yuan for embankment repair. More than 1,600 medical personnel from the Northeast, Shandong, Beijing, Tianjin and other places, including those sent by Anhui Province to serve the laborers at the embankment construction sites. The people in the mountainous areas of Anhui Province also organized a distant expedition labor team of 190,000 people to support the people in the polder areas in repairing the embankments. Employees of supply and marketing cooperatives, grain, transportation and other departments in various places along the Yangtze River also vigorously supported the embankment repair project.

　　安徽沿江堤防整修完工
    安徽省长江干堤和沿江内河圩堤整修工程胜利完工。整修后的江、河堤普遍加固培厚，使沿江粮食高产地区的八百三十万亩农田和沿江城市、工厂、交通运输有了安全的保障。
    安徽省沿江地区堤防整修工程是从一九五四年十二月份开始的。全部工程分冬修和春修两个施工阶段。冬修中因降大雪，只完成总任务百分之六点六，春修中又是雨雪连绵。为了按期完成堤防整修工程，民工们以小雨不停工、雨停就开工的忘我劳动热情，展开了大规模的劳动竞赛，大大加速了工程进度。怀宁县广济圩民工创造了“快速打硪法”和“一层土两次铺”的上土方法，使工作效率提高了一倍，并提高了硪工质量。
    安徽省长江干堤和沿江内河圩堤在整修中，得到国家和各地人民大力支援。国家拨出四千万元堤防整修经费。东北、山东、北京、天津等地连同安徽省派到堤防工地上为民工服务的医务人员，共有一千六百多名。安徽省山区的人民也组织了十九万人的远征民工队支援圩区人民整修堤防。沿江各地供销合作社和粮食、交通运输等部门的职工也大力支援了堤防整修工程。　（新华社）
