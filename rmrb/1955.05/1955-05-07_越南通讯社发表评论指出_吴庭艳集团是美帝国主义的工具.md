Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th. The Vietnam News Agency published a commentary on the 5th, saying: In the past few days, encouraged by Collins, who has just returned from Washington with new instructions from the U.S. ruling clique, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has staged increasingly shameless farces in an attempt to deceive public opinion and maintain its shaky position. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique gathered pro-American elements to establish the so-called "Democratic Revolutionary Forces." This clique boasted for Ngo Dinh Diem, and on the other hand, cursed Bao Dai. On the 5th, Ngo Dinh Diem staged a new play called "National Assembly" in Saigon.

The commentary pointed out: Obviously, the Vietnamese people and the people of the world are very aware of the nature of Bao Dai, and now the most cunning traitors who should be thoroughly exposed to public opinion are the group of U.S. imperialist lackeys headed by Ngo Dinh Diem.

The commentary said: The Ngo Dinh Diem clique is undermining the Geneva Armistice Agreement. It is plotting to turn South Vietnam into a U.S. military base and colony, obstruct the future free general elections to promote national reunification, and rekindle the flames of war. Following the orders of U.S. interventionists, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique forced and deceived hundreds of thousands of Catholics in the north to move to South Vietnam, causing the separation of countless families and plunging millions of forcibly displaced people into poverty and suffering. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique took despicable retaliatory measures against thousands of people in South Vietnam who had previously participated in the war of resistance. Ngo Dinh Diem has caused bloodshed in South Vietnam in the past few months, resulting in the death and injury of millions of people.

The commentary concluded: The people of South Vietnam, as well as the people of other parts of Vietnam, have seen through the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and its tool, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The so-called "National Assembly" convened by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique cannot deceive anyone.

　　越南通讯社发表评论指出
　　吴庭艳集团是美帝国主义的工具
    新华社河内六日电　越南通讯社五日发表评论说：过去几天中，在刚刚从华盛顿带着美国统治集团的新指示回来的柯林斯的鼓舞下，吴庭艳集团上演着愈来愈无耻的丑剧，企图欺骗舆论和保持它的动摇的地位。吴庭艳集团纠集亲美分子建立了所谓
  “民主革命力量”。这个集团替吴庭艳吹嘘，另一方面大骂保大。五日，吴庭艳又在西贡上演了一出名叫“国民大会”的新戏。
    评论指出：显然，越南人民和全世界人民是十分了解保大的本质的，而现在应该在舆论面前彻底加以揭露的最狡猾的卖国贼是以吴庭艳为首的美帝国主义者的走狗集团。
    评论说：吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦停战协定。它阴谋把南越变成美国的军事基地和殖民地，阻挠将来的要促成国家统一的自由普选，并重新燃起战火。吴庭艳集团遵照美国干涉者的命令，强迫和欺骗北部的数十万天主教徒迁移到南越去，造成了无数家庭的离散，并使千万被强迫迁移的人陷入贫困和痛苦。吴庭艳集团对于南越成千上万的以前参加抗战运动的人采取了卑劣的报复措施。吴庭艳在过去数月中在南越引起了流血事件，造成千万人的死伤。
    评论最后说：南越人民以及越南其他各地的人民都已经看穿了美帝国主义者和它的工具吴庭艳集团的阴谋。吴庭艳集团召开的所谓“国民大会”是欺骗不了任何人的。
