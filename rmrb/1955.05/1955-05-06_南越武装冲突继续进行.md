Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 4th: According to Saigon sources, Ngo Dinh Diem's troops continued their heavy attacks on the Binh Xuyen派 (Binh Xuyen faction) forces in the Saigon-Cholon area on the 2nd and 3rd. According to reports, after Ngo Dinh Diem's troops occupied the outposts controlled by the Binh Xuyen派 on the outskirts of Cholon, they have attacked the area where the Binh Xuyen派 headquarters are located south of Cholon. Some of the Binh Xuyen派 troops have surrendered, and the Binh Xuyen派 headquarters and remaining troops have retreated south to the suburbs. A large fire broke out in Cholon, and black smoke filled the city.

The so-called "Revolutionary Committee" supporting Ngo Dinh Diem announced on the 3rd that it would convene a so-called "National Congress" on the 5th to formally "depose" Bao Dai, establish a "republic," and have Ngo Dinh Diem organize a "provisional government." Ngo Dinh Diem delivered a radio address expressing his agreement with the "Revolutionary Committee's" plan to convene the congress. On the other hand, Bao Dai, in France, sent a telegram to Ngo Dinh Diem denouncing the planned "National Congress" as "illegal."

The U.S. State Department has repeatedly stated its continued support for Ngo Dinh Diem. U.S. senators are also expressing the same attitude. Democratic Senator Humphrey said that if the South Vietnamese government cannot accommodate both Ngo Dinh Diem and Bao Dai, then "Bao Dai should go." He said, "Now is the time for us to break with him (Bao Dai) rather than with Ngo Dinh Diem." Another Democratic Senator, Mansfield, said that he believed the situation was unfavorable for Ngo Dinh Diem to continue in power, but said, "He is the only man we have, there is no other way," and that he must be supported.

French Prime Minister Faure, speaking on the French National Assembly on the 3rd regarding France's attitude toward the situation in South Vietnam, said that the South Vietnamese government should be built on a "broad base." He said: The French government "need not show any preference among the various parties and tendencies that may compete for leadership of South Vietnamese national life." He stated that the French government would seek to "reach a common position" with the United States.

　　南越武装冲突继续进行
    新华社河内四日电　据西贡消息，吴庭艳军队在二日、三日继续向西贡、堤岸地区的平川派军队发动猛攻。据消息说，吴庭艳军队在占领了堤岸外围平川派控制的各据点后，已经攻入堤岸南边的平川派总部所在地区。平川派军队有一部分投降了，平川派总部和剩余部队已经向南撤退到郊外。堤岸烧起了大火，黑烟笼罩在城市上空。
    支持吴庭艳的所谓“革命委员会”三日宣布要在五日召开所谓“国民大会”来正式“废黜”保大，建立“共和国”，并且要吴庭艳组织“临时政府”。吴庭艳发表了广播演说，表示同意“革命委员会”召开大会的计划。另一方面，在法国的保大给吴庭艳一个电报，指责准备举行的“国民大会”是“非法”的。
    美国国务院一再表示继续支持吴庭艳。美国的议员们也在表示同样的态度。民主党参议员汉弗莱说，如果南越政府不能对吴庭艳和保大兼容并纳，那么“该走的是保大”。他说：“现在是我们同他
  （保大）而不是同吴庭艳决裂的时候了”。另一个民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德说，他相信形势是不利于吴庭艳继续执政的，但是又说，“他是我们仅有的一个人，没有别的办法”，只有支持他。
    法国总理富尔，三日在法国国民议会上谈到法国对南越局势的态度时说：南越政府应该建立在
  “广泛的基础上”。他说：法国政府“不必在可能争夺对南越国家生活的领导权的各党派和各种倾向之间表示有所偏爱”。他表示法国政府要设法同美国“取得共同的立场”。
