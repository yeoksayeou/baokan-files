　　驻旅顺口的我国水兵同苏联水兵热情联欢
    新华社旅大十七日电　驻旅顺口地区的苏联水兵在回国以前同中国人民解放军驻旅顺口地区的水兵举行了几百次友谊晚会和联欢会。
    在友谊晚会上，两国水兵互相介绍了许多英雄的事迹。苏联水兵们以自豪的心情谈到海军中士尼克拉依·维尔科夫以自己的胸膛挡住了敌人枪眼的英雄事迹；谈到苏军中尉谢罗宁指挥下的二十五名士兵在一次战斗中全部获得苏联英雄称号的英勇故事；他们还谈到在一次激战中，有五名水兵勇敢地把手榴弹系在腰带上，炸毁了德寇十来辆坦克的感人事迹。中国水兵们也给苏联水兵讲述了击沉蒋贼军“太平号”军舰、二万五千里长征时的十八勇士强渡大渡河、抗日战争中的狼牙山五壮士、在解放战争中的塔山英雄团和舍身炸毁敌军碉堡的董存瑞烈士等英雄业绩和战斗故事。
    在这个期间，中国水兵和苏联水兵还举行了五百五十多次联欢会。中苏水兵们在会上尽情歌舞，亲切地话别；他们并互赠了最有意义的礼物。在这些礼物中有水兵们亲手制成的兵舰、坦克、大炮、飞机、莫斯科红场和北京天安门等逼真的模型及象征中苏两国军队伟大友谊的大幅油画。在各个联欢会上，中苏两国水兵互赠的有纪念意义的礼物有一百多种，五千四百多件。
