	Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Secret Agent Murder Crimes Confirmed
	The plane crash involving the personnel of the Chinese and Vietnamese Democratic Republic delegations to the Asian-African Conference and Chinese and foreign journalists en route to Bandung via Hong Kong has been strongly proven to have been caused by a time bomb. The Indonesian Investigation Committee released a summary of the investigation report on the sabotage of the aircraft on the 27th, and the Hong Kong authorities also issued a special gazette on the plane crash on the same day. The Indonesian Investigation Committee, after a thorough investigation, concluded that the crash of the Indian International Airlines Constellation aircraft "Kashmir Princess," carrying the staff of the Chinese and Vietnamese delegations to the Bandung Conference and Chinese and foreign journalists, was caused by the explosion of a time bomb. The Hong Kong authorities, in a special gazette issued, also admitted that "given the time factor, it seems most likely that the explosives were in fact placed on the aircraft while the aircraft was in Hong Kong." This fully and powerfully confirms our repeated accusation that the plane crash was deliberately sabotaged by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents. The Chinese people express their deep gratitude to the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and all those involved in this investigation, and express their satisfaction with the responsible attitude of the Hong Kong authorities in expressing their willingness to "resolve to make every effort to investigate the facts...and to do their utmost to bring the perpetrators to justice." We believe that after these impartial investigations, the despicable murder committed by Chiang Kai-shek's secret service organization will be fully exposed before the people of the world.

　　蒋匪特务谋杀罪行得到证实
    我国和越南民主共和国参加亚非会议代表团的工作人员和中外记者所乘飞机，在途经香港前往万隆途中的失事事件，已经得到有力证明，是由于遭到定时炸弹的破坏而造成的。印度尼西亚调查委员会在二十七日公布了该机遭受破坏的调查报告摘要，香港当局也在同日就此飞机失事事件发表了特别公报。印度尼西亚调查委员会经过周密调查得出的结论是载运中国和越南参加万隆会议代表团工作人员和中外记者的印度国际航空公司星座式飞机“克什米尔公主号”的失事，是由一个定时炸弹的爆炸所造成的。香港当局在发表的特别公报中，也承认“鉴于时间的因素，看来最可能的是，爆炸物事实上是当飞机在香港停留的时候被安放在飞机上的”。这就充分有力地证实了我国所一再提出的飞机失事事件是由蒋介石特务分子所蓄意破坏的指责。中国人民对于印度尼西亚共和国政府和从事这一调查工作的各方面人士的努力表示深切感谢，对于香港当局所表示的愿意“决心作一切努力来调查事实，……决心尽全力来使肇事者归案法办”的负责态度表示满意。我们相信，经过这些公正调查之后，蒋介石特务组织所进行的卑鄙的谋杀罪行，定将在全世界人士面前完全暴露。
