　　Sending More Skilled Workers to Participate in Key Construction Projects
　　Wang Ke, Deputy Director of Shanghai Labor Bureau

    China's socialist construction is developing rapidly, with many large-scale new, renovated, or expanded enterprises undergoing intense construction or already in production. In recent years, more than 70,000 workers, engineers, technicians, and economic management cadres from Shanghai have left for work positions that are more needed by national construction. Since the second half of 1954, under the unified leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, the work of transferring technical personnel has been further strengthened, and the mobilization of skilled workers to participate in national key construction projects has begun in an organized and large-scale manner. By the end of March of this year, more than 5,500 metalworking technicians had gone to work in national automotive, tractor, petroleum, steel, and non-ferrous metal factories and mines. These technicians are relatively outstanding, with 35 percent being Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. There are also many labor models, veteran workers, and trade union cadres, with technical skills mostly at the fourth or fifth grade level.

    Many touching stories emerged during the process of Shanghai skilled workers signing up to participate in national key construction projects. Seven young technicians from Antai Machinery Factory postponed their weddings to support national key construction. The wife of technician Lu Pinxiang from Xin'an Electric Motor Factory, after hearing half of the mobilization report at the factory's meeting, told her husband, "I'll sign you up for the conference to go." Veteran technician Hu Quangen, with 37 years of experience, led nine young technicians he personally trained to sign up, five of whom have been approved to go with him to new production posts.钳工许惠忠, 许惠荣 brothers Xu Huizhong and Xu Huirong, both fitters from Yichang Machinery Factory, set off together to participate in construction. Their mother in the countryside, upon hearing the news, encouraged them to "concentrate on their work and contribute more to socialist construction." 青工刘祖龙 Youth worker Liu Zulong from Zhongjian Electric Motor Factory, failed to sign up last year due to insufficient skills. He studied and practiced hard, striving to improve his skills, and finally signed up in February of this year.

    After arriving at the new enterprises, these workers have generally been able to overcome some temporary difficulties in life and production, diligently study technology, actively propose rationalization suggestions, and continuously improve labor productivity. For example, more than a hundred workers who went to a certain place to participate in capital construction faced very difficult living conditions when they first arrived at the construction site. The dormitories were far from the factory buildings, and the workers braved the severe cold every day to rush to the construction site, insisting on installing on the tall steel and reinforced concrete structures. Su Huisheng, a former worker from Shanghai Xin Zhonghua Iron Factory, has put forward more than a dozen rationalization proposals since arriving at the new factory last August, one of which can increase production efficiency tenfold and basically eliminate defective products. Shanghai worker Zhang Panlun and 11 others who participated in the work of a coal mining company completed the task assigned to them by the leadership of installing two Soviet-style coal-mining electric vehicles in 13 days, a task originally scheduled for two months. Technicians who went to work in units such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have also played a good role in their work. Some workers have been promoted to team leaders, section chiefs, or workshop managers, some have joined the Communist Party of China or the Communist Youth League, and others have been selected to study abroad.

    Party and government organs, trade unions, Communist Youth League, and women's federations at all levels in Shanghai attach great importance to the work of mobilizing technicians to participate in national key construction. The factories under the Shanghai Municipal Transportation Administration Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Textile Administration Bureau, and the publicly-privately owned Datong Iron Factory under the Shanghai Municipal Heavy Industry Administration Bureau generally actively mobilize outstanding veteran technicians from their factories to participate in national key construction projects. The Industry Departments of the Communist Party Committees in Putuo, Jiangning, Changning, and North Railway Station districts, based on the situation of skilled workers and factory production in their respective districts, have formulated plans for transferring technicians to ensure the completion of the task of transferring technicians with quality, quantity, and on schedule. At the same time, Jiangning, Yulin, and other districts also held technical training classes for employees, actively helping on-the-job workers improve their skills, so that many workers who were not approved in the first batch of applications due to insufficient skills were approved after training. Zhongjian Electric Motor Factory, while transferring 15 technicians with quality and quantity, appropriately adjusted the labor organization, promptly supplemented 28 apprentices, and combined production with technical training classes to systematically improve the technical level of the original workers. However, there are still many problems in the work of transferring skilled workers. First of all, the leaders of some factories do not have a sufficient understanding of the important significance of mobilizing technicians to support national key construction. They only one-sidedly emphasize that their unit's production tasks are busy and the technical potential is not great, and they are unwilling to accept the assigned quotas; or they repeatedly bargain, and if the bargaining fails, they make up the number with workers with lower technical skills. For example, some units lack unified consideration and arrangement for the transfer of technicians, so that in the third batch of transfer tasks, some units did not complete the original plan, and 11 factories did not even complete one. The six workers sent by the publicly-privately owned Shanglian Electrical Equipment Factory were all of lower technical level. This excuse of "busy production tasks and insufficient technical strength" as a reason to refuse to transfer technicians is incorrect, fully demonstrating that some leaders of some factories do not attach importance to the work of transferring technicians to support national key construction. They are afraid that the production tasks will not be completed after the technicians are transferred out. Although this concern has some basis, it is not entirely consistent with the actual situation. The key to the problem lies in improving labor organization, rationally using technical labor, and especially in actively training skilled workers. As mentioned earlier, Zhongjian Electric Motor Factory, through mobilizing technicians to participate in national key construction work, not only did not affect production, but on the contrary, promoted production.

    Mobilizing technicians to participate in key construction is a new task. The relevant departments do not have a deep and comprehensive understanding of the situation of existing skilled workers, and lack careful planning and unified arrangements for a series of tasks such as education, mobilization of technicians, production arrangements after the transfer, adjustment of labor organization, and supplement of apprentices. Therefore, a few technicians are not at ease in production after arriving at new jobs; the number of applications from middle-aged and elderly technicians with higher skills is not large, the distribution and mobilization tasks are not balanced and reasonable enough, and the factories with greater technical potential are relaxed. These shortcomings need to be overcome quickly.

    Secondly, the training work closely related to the transfer of skilled workers is far behind the needs of national construction, which is also an urgent problem to be solved in Shanghai. There are many reasons for this situation. In addition to the lack of in-depth understanding and vigorous promotion of the training potential by the labor and administrative departments, some private factories do not actively supplement training after skilled workers participate in national construction, attempting to reduce the scope; some state-owned, local state-owned, and publicly-privately owned enterprises have not paid enough attention to the training of skilled workers in terms of ideology. It is worth noting that after Shanghai has transferred more than 5,000 technicians, the factories have not paid attention to training work, which will inevitably make it difficult to continuously transfer technicians in the future, and will also affect the production in the factories. Therefore, this problem should be solved as soon as possible.

    In order to give full play to the role of Shanghai, an original industrial base, during the period of national construction, to further do a good job in transferring technicians to support national key construction, all factories and enterprises with the task of transferring technicians should proceed from the needs of national key construction, from the overall interests, overcome departmentalism and conservative ideas, and include the task of transferring technicians in the labor plan, and formulate specific transfer targets annually and quarterly, and transfer them with quality, quantity, and on schedule.

    To change the current situation that the training work cannot keep up with the development needs of national construction, it is necessary to proceed from the actual situation, take a long-term view, fully explore the training potential, timely absorb apprentices, and vigorously improve the technical level of existing workers based on the principle of "transferring a batch, growing a batch." We must seriously pay attention to and strengthen the training work, formulate practical training plans, strengthen the organization and leadership of the training work, and assign special personnel to be responsible. Party and trade union organizations at all levels should check, supervise, and assist in the completion of the plan at any time. Labor and administrative departments should also further understand the situation of existing technical labor, explore the training potential of factories, actively promote and guide the smooth progress of this work, so as to meet the growing needs of national construction for technical labor.

    The work of transferring technicians to support key construction is not only an arduous organizational work, but also a very meticulous ideological education work. Therefore, all relevant departments, especially the administrative aspects and trade union organizations of enterprises, must often conduct education on "everything for socialism" to the employees, so that the workers have a sense of honor and responsibility for participating in national key construction. At the same time, we should also focus on ideological education on hard work and obedience to the plan, so as to overcome the fear of hardship or the idea of picking areas and treatments based on personal immediate interests due to the lack of understanding of the temporary difficulties in the initial stage of national construction by some workers.

    To do the above work well, it is also necessary to strengthen the party's leadership over the work of mobilizing technicians to participate in national construction, conduct regular checks and supervision, and fight against those departmentalism and conservative ideas, so as to ensure the continuous transfer of technical talents to support national construction.

### 输送更多的技术工人参加重点建设

　　输送更多的技术工人参加重点建设
　　上海市劳动局副局长　王克
    我国的社会主义建设事业正在一日千里地向前发展，许多规模巨大的新建、改建或扩建企业，正在进行紧张的施工或已投入生产。几年来，上海市有七万多个工人、工程技术人员和经济工作干部离开上海，走上了国家建设更需要的工作岗位。从一九五四年下半年起，在中共上海市委和市人民委员会统一领导下，进一步加强了技术人才的输送工作，开始有组织地、成批地动员技术工人参加国家重点建设。到今年三月底为止，五千五百多名五金技工分别去到国家的汽车、拖拉机、石油、钢铁、有色金属等厂矿工作。这批技工都是比较优秀的，其中有百分之三十五是共产党员和青年团员，还有许多劳动模范、老工人和工会干部，他们的技术都在四、五级以上。
    上海技术工人在报名参加国家重点建设过程中，出现了很多动人的事例。安泰机器厂七个青年技工，为支援国家重点建设推迟了婚期。新安电机厂技工陆品祥的妻子，在这个厂动员大会上听了一半报告，就向丈夫说：“我给你向大会报名去。”有三十七年工龄的老年技工胡全根率领他亲手培养的九个青年技工报名，其中有五个已被批准，跟他一齐走上新的生产岗位。义昌机器厂钳工许惠忠、许惠荣兄弟俩一同出发参加建设，在乡下的母亲闻讯后鼓励他们要“专心干活，多为社会主义建设出力。”中建电机厂青工刘祖龙，去年因技术不够没有报上名，他就苦学苦练，努力提高技术，今年二月里终于报上了名。
    这批工人到达新企业以后，一般都能克服生活上、生产上的某些暂时困难，刻苦钻研技术，积极提出合理化建议，不断地提高劳动生产率。如前往某地参加基本建设的百多个工人，刚到工地时生活十分艰苦，宿舍离厂房很远，工人们每天冒着严寒赶往工地，坚持在高大的钢筋铁骨上进行安装工作。原上海新中华铁工厂工人苏惠生，自去年八月抵达新厂后，已提出十几件合理化建议，其中有一项，能使生产效率提高十倍，并基本上消灭了废品。参加某煤矿公司工作的上海工人张盘伦等十二人，以十三天时间完成了领导上交给他们两个月安装两台苏联式起煤电车的任务。前往第一汽车制造厂等单位工作的技工，在工作中也起了很好的作用，一部分工人已被提拔为小组长、工段长或车间管理人员，有的已参加了中国共产党或青年团，还有的被选拔出国学习。
    上海各级党政机关、工会、青年团和妇联等组织，十分重视动员技工参加国家重点建设的工作。市交通运输管理局、市纺织管理局所属各厂和市重工业管理局所属公私合营大同铁工厂等，一般都积极把本厂优秀的老年技术工人动员去参加国家的重点建设。提篮、江宁、长宁、北站等区的中共区委工业部，根据本区技术工人情况和工厂生产情况编制输送技工的方案，保证按质按量按期完成输送技工的任务。同时江宁、榆林等区还举办职工技术学习班，积极帮助在职工人提高技术，使很多在第一批报名时因技术不够未被批准的工人在经过学习以后被批准了。中建电机厂，在按质按量输送了十五个技工的同时，适当地调整了劳动组织，及时补充了二十八名艺徒，并结合生产和举办技术学习班，有计划地提高原有工人技术水平。但是，在输送技术工人的工作中也存在不少问题。首先是有些工厂的领导上对动员技工支援国家重点建设的重要意义认识不足，他们只片面强调本单位生产任务忙、技术潜力不大，不肯接受分配的名额；或者一再讨价还价，还价不成则以技术较低的工人凑数。如有些单位对输送技工缺乏统一的考虑和安排，以致在第三批的输送任务中，有的单位没有完成原计划，有十一个工厂连一名也没完成。公私合营上联电工器材厂送出的六名工人，都是技术水平较低的。这种以“生产任务忙、技术力量不足”作为拒绝输送技术工人的借口是不对的，充分说明了部分工厂的某些领导人员对输送技工支援国家重点建设的工作是不重视的。他们怕技工调出后完不成生产任务，这种顾虑虽有部分根据，但并不完全符合实际情况。问题的关键在于改进劳动组织，合理使用技术劳动力，特别在于积极培养技术工人。前述中建电机厂通过动员技工参加国家重点建设工作，不仅没有影响生产，相反地还推动了生产。
    动员技工参加重点建设是一项新的工作，有关部门对现有技术工人情况的了解不够深入和不够全面，对技工的教育动员和输送后的生产安排、劳动组织的调整和学徒补充等一系列工作还缺乏周密计划和统一安排。因此，有个别技工到新的工作岗位后不安心生产；技术较高的中老年技工报名数字不大，在分配动员任务时也不够平衡和合理，放松了技术潜力较大的工厂。这些缺点需要迅速克服。
    其次，同输送技术工人密切相连的培养训练工作，还远远落后于国家建设的需要，这也是上海当前急待解决的一个问题。造成这一情况的原因很多，除了劳动、行政部门对培养训练潜力缺乏深入了解和大力推动以外，并由于有些私营厂在技术工人参加国家建设以后，不积极补充培养，企图缩小范围；有些国营、地方国营、公私合营企业对培养训练技术工人工作也未在思想上引起足够的重视。值得注意的是，上海在输送五千多名技工以后，目前各厂还没有重视培养训练工作，这必然会使今后源源不断输送技工工作发生困难，同时将会影响厂里的生产，因此，应及早解决这一问题。
    为了充分发挥上海这一原有工业基地在国家建设时期的作用，进一步做好输送技工支援国家重点建设的工作，凡有输送技工的任务的工厂企业应从一切服从国家重点建设需要，服从整体利益出发，克服本位主义和保守思想，并将输送技工的任务列入劳动计划之内，按年按季订出具体的输送目标，保质保量按期输送。
    要改变目前培养训练工作赶不上国家建设发展需要的情况，必须根据“抽调一批，成长一批”的原则，从实际出发，从长远着眼，充分发掘培养训练潜力，及时吸收学徒，并大力提高现有工人的技术水平。必须认真重视并加强培养训练工作，订出切实可行的培养训练计划，加强培养训练工作的组织领导，并指定专人负责。各级党和工会的组织应随时检查监督和协助计划的完成。劳动行政部门也应进一步摸清现有技术劳动力的情况，发掘工厂培养训练潜力，积极推动并指导这项工作的顺利进行，以满足国家建设对技术劳动力日益增长的需要。
    抽调技工支援重点建设工作不仅是一项艰巨的组织工作，同时也是一个十分细致的思想教育工作。因此，各有关部门特别是企业的行政方面和工会组织，今后必须经常向职工群众进行“一切为了社会主义”的教育，使工人群众树立参加国家重点建设的光荣感和责任感。与此同时，还应着重进行艰苦奋斗、服从计划的思想教育，以克服部分工人因对国家建设初期的暂时困难认识不足，而产生的害怕艰苦或是从个人眼前利益出发而挑拣地区、待遇等思想。
    要做好上述工作，还必须加强党对动员技工参加国家建设工作的领导，经常检查督促，并对那些本位主义和保守思想进行斗争，以保证不断地输送技术人材支援国家建设。
