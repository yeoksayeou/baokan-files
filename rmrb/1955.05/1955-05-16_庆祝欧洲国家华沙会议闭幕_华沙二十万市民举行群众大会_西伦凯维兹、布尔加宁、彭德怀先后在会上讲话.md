Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 15th: On the 14th, 200,000 citizens of Warsaw held a mass rally to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Warsaw Conference of European Countries for Ensuring Peace and Security in Europe.

When First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Beirut, Chairman of the State Council of the Polish People's Republic, Zawadzki, members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, the head of the Soviet delegation to the Warsaw Conference, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, members of the Soviet delegation, Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Soviet Union Zhukov, Marshal Konev of the Soviet Union, and other members of the Soviet delegation, the heads and members of the delegations of Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and the representative of the People's Republic of China, Peng Dehuai, appeared on the rostrum, those present responded with stormy and sustained applause.

The Chairman of the Warsaw People's Council, Albrecht, delivered the opening speech, warmly congratulating the representatives of the participating countries at the Warsaw Conference. Then, the head of the Polish delegation, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic, Cyrankiewicz, spoke. He said: The Warsaw Conference will go down in history as a major measure in the struggle to win peace and security for our countries, for the peace and security of the people of Europe, and for lasting peace in the world. This is a powerful response from the people of our countries to the Paris Agreements. The resolutions of the conference will strengthen the power and unity of the peace camp and will prevent the imperialists from embarking on the path of war. The residents of Warsaw and all the Polish people warmly welcome the resolutions of the Warsaw Conference, because these resolutions point out the victorious path to peace for billions of people around the world. The Polish people will do their utmost to make more contributions to strengthening the power and unity of the peace camp.

The head of the Soviet government delegation, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, delivered a speech at the meeting. Bulganin said that today is the closing day of the Warsaw Conference of European Countries for Ensuring Peace and Security in Europe. This conference was conducted in an atmosphere of complete agreement and great sincerity, which is only possible among the closest of friends. All participants in the conference particularly welcomed the participation of the representative of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, General Peng Dehuai, as an observer. The speech by the representative of the great Chinese people was warmly welcomed by the people of our countries, and it forced those who are planning new wars to think twice. After analyzing the new situation in the international situation, Bulganin said that we, who have experienced all the devastation of destructive wars, are taking new measures to strengthen our defense capabilities to ensure the safety and peaceful labor of the people of our countries, which is a matter of course. The Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Armed Forces of the Treaty Signatory States of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, Soviet Marshal Konev, is very familiar to the Polish people. During the years of the last war, the army commanded by Marshal Konev participated in the war to liberate Poland from Hitler's oppression. There is no doubt that the joint armed forces of the treaty signatory states under the command of Marshal Konev will not fail our hopes and will fulfill their mission. Bulganin continued, the treaty signed today is defensive. The principle of peaceful coexistence among countries proclaimed by the great Lenin is the unshakable foundation of the peace-loving policies of the democratic camp countries. The Soviet government's new proposals on the issues of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of a new war are a vivid example of our desire to consolidate peace. We advocate peace. At the same time, we firmly and resolutely declare that we will take all measures to ensure that the borders of our countries are inviolable and that the peace of our people is not disrupted.

Bulganin's speech was constantly interrupted by stormy applause and cheers.

The observer from the People's Republic of China to the Warsaw Conference, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, Peng Dehuai, then spoke at the meeting. Peng Dehuai said that the Warsaw Conference has achieved results of great historical significance that are expected by all peace-loving countries and people. The Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance of the Eight Countries and the Joint Command established on the basis of this treaty are the crystallization of the firm will of the European peace-loving countries to unite and ensure peace and security in Europe. It is a powerful response to the American aggressive group and its followers who are reviving German militarism and preparing for a new war, and it is also an important step in defending world peace. The government of the People's Republic of China and the 600 million people fully and unreservedly support the decisions of this conference and will give full cooperation. Peng Dehuai said that, like the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, we have always been faithful to the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence of different social systems and have always advocated resolving all international disputes through peaceful consultation. This spirit is also reflected in the decisions of this Warsaw Conference. We believe that the expression in the Eight-Nation Treaty to continue striving for the establishment of a European collective security system will surely win the sympathy and support of all peace-loving people in Europe and the world. Peng Dehuai continued, the European countries conference was held in Warsaw with special significance. The Polish people, who have suffered deeply from the disasters of German militarism in the two world wars, know the value of peace. Today, protecting the hard-earned construction achievements of the Polish people are not only united Polish people, but also the 900 million people of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world standing together with them. Peng Dehuai finally said that the just cause of the people of all countries united by the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism cannot be attacked and broken by any enemy. In the cause of defending peace in Europe and the world, the Chinese people will always be your most reliable and most faithful friends. Let us join hands and advance bravely for the cause of peace and justice!

Peng Dehuai's speech was warmly welcomed.

Finally, the participants in the mass rally unanimously passed a resolution: The resolution said that the representatives of the citizens of Warsaw participating in the mass rally warmly and sincerely welcome the resolutions of the Warsaw Conference of European Countries for Ensuring Peace and Security in Europe. The document signed today by the representatives of the eight countries has largely consolidated the peace and security of our countries and all countries threatened by the forces of imperialist aggression.

The Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, as well as the resolution on the establishment of the Joint Command of the armed forces of our countries, expresses the unshakable will of all our countries to restrain aggressors, prevent the outbreak of war, and consolidate and maintain peace. The resolution of the conference also shows the tireless efforts of all countries in the peace camp to establish a pan-European collective security system. The resolutions of the conference will strengthen the will to fight everywhere to shatter the plans of the aggressors and to strengthen the hopes of all those who desire peace. (Attached picture)

    新华社华沙十五日电  十四日，华沙二十万市民举行群众大会，庆祝欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全的华沙会议胜利闭幕。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记贝鲁特，波兰人民共和国国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基，波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员们，参加华沙会议的苏联代表团团长、苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁，苏联代表团团员、苏联国防部长、苏联元帅朱可夫，苏联元帅科湼夫和苏联代表团其他团员，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长和团员，中华人民共和国代表彭德怀在主席台上出现时，到会者报以暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。
    华沙市人民会议主席阿尔布列赫特致开会词，他向参加华沙会议的各国代表热烈祝贺。接着，波兰代表团团长、波兰人民共和国部长会议主席西伦凯维兹讲话。他说：华沙会议将作为争取我们各国的和平和安全、争取欧洲各国人民的和平和安全，以及争取全世界持久和平的斗争中的重大措施载入史册。这是我们这些国家的人民对巴黎协定的强有力的答复。会议的决议将加强和平阵营的力量和团结，并且将防止帝国主义者走上战争的道路。华沙居民和全体波兰人民热烈欢迎华沙会议的决议，因为这个决议向全世界亿万人们指出了争取和平的胜利道路。波兰人民将竭尽全力为加强和平阵营的力量和团结作出更多的贡献。
    苏联政府代表团团长、苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在会上发表了演说。布尔加宁说，今天是欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全的华沙会议闭幕的日子。这次会议是在只有在最亲近的朋友当中才可能有的完全一致和非常诚挚的气氛中进行的。会议全体参加者特别满意地欢迎中华人民共和国代表、中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀将军以观察员身份参加这次会议。伟大的中国人民的代表的发言受到我们各国人民的热烈欢迎，它使那些策划新战争的人不得不有所考虑。布尔加宁在分析了国际形势中的新情况之后说，经历过破坏性战争的一切惨祸的我们，采取新措施来加强防御能力，以保障我们各国人民的安全及和平劳动，这是理所当然的事。友好合作互助条约签字国联合武装部队总司令、苏联元帅科湼夫，对波兰人民说来是很熟悉的。在上次大战的年代中，由科湼夫元帅所指挥的军队参加了把波兰从希特勒压迫下解放出来的战争。毫无疑问，在科湼夫元帅指挥下的条约签字国的联合武装部队，是不会辜负我们的希望，并会完成自己的使命的。布尔加宁接着说，今天所签订的这个条约是防御性的。伟大的列宁所宣布的各国和平共处的原则是民主阵营各国爱好和平政策不可动摇的基础。苏联政府关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的新建议，就是我们对巩固和平的愿望的鲜明例证。我们主张和平。同时我们坚定地、坚决地声明，我们将采取一切措施以使我们各国的国境不受侵犯，使我们各国人民的和平不遭破坏。
    布尔加宁的演说不断为暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声所打断。
    中华人民共和国出席华沙会议的观察员、国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀接着在会上讲话。彭德怀说，华沙会议已取得了为所有爱好和平国家和人民所期望的有重大历史意义的结果，八国友好合作互助条约和在这个条约基础上建立的联合司令部，是欧洲爱好和平的国家团结一致保障欧洲和平与安全的坚决意志的结晶，是对美国侵略集团和它的追随者复活德国军国主义准备新战争的一个有力的回答，同时也是保卫世界和平的一个重要的步骤。中华人民共和国政府和六亿人民完全无保留地支持这次会议的决定，并将给予充分的合作。彭德怀说，与苏联和各人民民主国家一样，我们一贯忠实于列宁主义关於不同社会制度和平共处的原则，一贯主张用和平协商的方式解决一切国际争端，这种精神也体现在这次华沙会议的决定中。我们相信，八国条约中关于继续为争取建立欧洲集体安全体系而努力的表示，一定会赢得全欧洲和全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持。彭德怀接着说，欧洲国家会议在华沙召开是有其特别的意义的。在两次世界大战中深受德国军国主义灾难的波兰人民深知和平的可贵。今天保卫波兰人民辛勤的建设成果的不仅有团结一致的波兰人，而且有同他们站在一起以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的九亿人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民。彭德怀最后说，以马克思列宁主义的伟大思想团结起来的各国人民的正义事业是任何敌人所攻击不破的。在保卫欧洲和世界和平的事业中，中国人民永远是你们最可靠最忠实的朋友。让我们并肩携手为和平和正义的事业勇敢前进吧！
    彭德怀的讲话受到了热烈的欢迎。
    最后，群众大会参加者一致通过一项决议：决议说，参加群众大会的华沙市民代表热烈地和衷心地欢迎欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全华沙会议的决议。今天八国代表签字的文件在很大程度上巩固了我们这些国家、以及受到帝国主义侵略势力威胁的所有各国人民的和平和安全。
    友好合作互助条约以及关于建立我们各国武装部队的联合司令部的决议，表现了所有我们各国人民约束侵略者、不让战争爆发、巩固和维护和平的不可动摇的意志。会议的决议同时也表明了和平阵营所有各国对建立全欧集体安全体系的不倦的努力。会议的决议将加强各地为粉碎侵略者的计划、为加强一切渴望和平的人们的希望而斗争的意志。（附图片）
