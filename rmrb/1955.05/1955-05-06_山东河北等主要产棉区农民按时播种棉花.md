Farmers in Shandong, Shaanxi, Hebei, Shanxi, Hubei and other provinces are actively sowing cotton. In Shandong Province, farmers in counties such as Fucheng, Shanxian, Yuncheng, and Juye in the Heze Special District had completed more than half of their cotton sowing plans by mid-April. Farmers in Huimin, Dezhou, Liaocheng, Jiaozhou and other special districts also began sowing in late April. It is expected that the entire province will be sown by early May.

In Shaanxi Province, cotton has mostly been planted in Ankang, Xunyang and other counties in the Han River basin in the south. In Guanzhong, the seven counties of Hancheng and Heyang, which received more rain, and large-scale canal irrigation areas generally began sowing after April 10. In the Jinghui Canal irrigation area, approximately 200,000 mu of cotton fields have been sown. In some areas of Liquan, Chaoyi and other nine counties where there was less rain and insufficient soil moisture, farmers also adopted methods such as carrying water to plant in order to sow cotton in a timely manner. In Shaanxi Province, Mizhi, Huangling and other counties also seized the opportunity to sow cotton while the soil was moist from the rain.

Cotton sowing has fully commenced in Hebei Province. Farmers in Handan Special District took advantage of the good soil moisture after the rain to sow early, and had planted 2.2 million mu of cotton by April 26. Over 1.8 million mu has been planted in Shijiazhuang Special District.

The sowing of 3.4 million mu of cotton fields in the Jinan area of Shanxi Province has basically ended. According to statistics from 15 counties including Yongji, Jieyu, Yicheng, and Anze, 2,293,350 mu had been sown as of April 25, reaching 99 percent of the original plan. The original plan for 44 townships in Jishan and Wenxi counties was to plant 226,800 mu of cotton, but the actual sowing was 233,500 mu, exceeding the original plan by 3 percent.

Cotton farmers in the Huanggang, Jingzhou, Xiangyang and other special districts of Hubei Province are sowing cotton according to national requirements. Liuji Township in Xinzhou County reclaimed 146 mu of wasteland to expand the cotton planting area, and the planned sowing area has now reached 5,024 mu. Chengxi Township in Jiangling County has expanded from the original plan of 4,200 mu of cotton to 4,332 mu. In Xiangyang Special District, over 70 percent of the wheat stubble cotton has been sown, and spring cotton is beginning to be sown, with riverbank cotton planting nearing completion.

The three mechanized farms in the Yellow River Flooded Area, Bo’ai, and Minquan, as well as 11 local state-run farms in Jiaozuo, Yanjin, Xinxiang, Dengxian and other counties in Henan Province, began sowing cotton in early April and had completed the sowing of more than 17,000 mu of cotton according to the national plan by around April 20.
