Letters from 61 teaching staff and administrative staff members including Su Keqin, Xiong Shouqi, Yang Xin, Dean of Academic Affairs, and Xia Kangnong, Deputy Director of the Research Department of the Central Institute for Nationalities: The "People's Daily" has successively revealed two batches of secret letters written by Hu Feng to his followers, which have confirmed the long-term anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary criminal acts of Hu Feng and the Hu Feng clique. Hu Feng is a most vicious villain who has been lurking in the revolutionary ranks for more than 20 years, carrying out sabotage activities. We have seen his extremely ugly and hideous face, and we are extremely angry. We specifically held a symposium today to unanimously denounce the counter-revolutionary crimes of the counter-revolutionary villain Hu Feng and the members of the Hu Feng clique. We fully support the resolution made by the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, and we believe that they are completely correct.

We also request:
	One, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, in accordance with the provisions of Article 38 of the Constitution, revoke Hu Feng's qualification as a representative to the National People's Congress.
	Two, the Supreme People's Procuratorate take necessary action against Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes.

We also warn the members of the Hu Feng clique that they must come forward to expose Hu Feng, criticize themselves, and start anew.

Letter from all first-year students of the Language and Literature Department of the Chinese Department of Peking University: We were admitted to the Chinese Department of Peking University last summer vacation and became a reserve force on the cultural front of the Party. At the beginning of our studies, we were determined to fight to defend the Party's literary and artistic undertakings and to build a socialist culture. For us, learning and struggle are inseparable. In the struggle to expose the cunning and stubborn enemy Hu Feng, we want to say what we have to say.

In his article "The Anti-Socialist Program of Hu Feng," Dean Guo Moruo pointed out that in China's literary and artistic circles, and even the entire cultural circles, "it is impossible to find another literary ambitious person who stubbornly persists in errors like Hu Feng," and said: "Up to now, we have not seen a complete anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist construction and socialist transformation bourgeois political program. Perhaps Hu Feng's grand literary program is a shadow of it?" This comment is very accurate. Facts have proved that before publicly proposing his "program," Hu Feng mobilized all the main forces in the reactionary clique to participate in the preparation and drafting work, and organized discussions in various "bases," treating it as the common ideological and action program and "organizational principles" that the Hu Feng clique must "abide by." Therefore, Hu Feng's "ambition" and "program" are no longer just a matter in the field of literary thought, but a serious political reactionary and sinful conspiracy, and a confrontation between the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary camps.

Hu Feng has been "charging" the Party and the people for more than ten years. He not only has a set of theoretical foundations and "organizational principles," but also a complete strategic and tactical plan. Even the secret languages, codes, and various most despicable hooligan methods commonly used by all counter-revolutionary cliques have been used by Hu Feng without any change. Therefore, when we read the materials about Hu Feng exposed by the "People's Daily," we could not help but recall the "Exhibition of Evidence of Crimes of American Airdropped Secret Agents" that we visited some time ago. Indeed, putting Hu Feng's letters there would be no less impressive. The conspiratorial activities of Hu Feng and his reactionary clique before and after liberation are not only essentially connected with the counter-revolutionary clique headed by Chiang Kai-shek, and are exactly the same, but also in terms of specific practices and changes in strategies and tactics, Hu Feng also strived to echo them internally and externally, and advance and retreat in unison.

All the teachers and students of the Chinese Department of Peking University, together with all the teachers and students of the school and the cultural circles of the country, under the leadership of the Party, have carried out a period of struggle to criticize Hu Shi's reactionary ideas. More than two-thirds of the papers criticizing Hu Shi presented at the recent departmental scientific discussion meeting marked the initial victory of this struggle. In the future, we will continue to carry out the struggle against Hu Feng and his reactionary clique together with all the teachers and students of the department under the leadership of the Party in order to thoroughly eliminate the harmful effects he has spread among young people.

Letter from Yang Yinglin, Qiu Weigang, Yi Changhui and 26 other students of the third class of the third grade of the Statistics Department of Renmin University of China: We have finished reading the two batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party clique in the "People's Daily" with extreme anger. The 600 million Chinese people wholeheartedly love and support their savior - our Party and Chairman Mao, and fully trust and will always be loyal to all the policies and lines (including the literary and artistic line) formulated by the Party and Chairman Mao, because they are undoubtedly true truths, and historical facts have proved that they are invincible. However, this group of conspirators headed by Hu Feng wants to point the finger at the revolution, the people, the Party and Chairman Mao, and the literary and artistic work led by the Party. Their sneaky and destructive conspiratorial activities are not allowed by thousands of Chinese people.

We demand severe punishment of this group of anti-Party and counter-revolutionary elements, and demand a thorough investigation of their crimes and exposure to the people of the whole country. We fully agree with the suggestions of people from all walks of life regarding the removal of Hu Feng from all positions and the revocation of his qualifications as a representative to the National People's Congress. We warn the accomplices of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique that it is time for you to bow your heads and confess your guilt and thoroughly confess your crimes to the people.

As the editor of the "People's Daily" pointed out, we must be vigilant in all aspects of our work and expose those counter-revolutionaries who ostensibly support us but actually oppose us. We also know very clearly that all reactionary forces, all open and hidden counter-revolutionary enemies, no matter how cunning and insidious they are, will always be smashed to pieces and completely defeated in front of our Party and in front of our great Chinese people. The exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique this time is also a victory for us.

Letter from all second-year students of the Department of Political Education of Beijing Normal University: The Hu Feng anti-Party clique stubbornly resisted the revolutionary literary and artistic movement led by the Party, attempted to seize the leadership of the literary and artistic front, and replace the Marxist literary and artistic line with Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary literary and artistic line in order to achieve their ulterior motives. In fact, he was closely cooperating with Chiang Kai-shek to attack the people's revolution. Hu Feng hated the Party and the people to the core. In order to oppose the Party and the people, he was even willing to cut off his head and throw it out. This is Hu Feng's face of thorough opposition to the revolution.

In the materials announced this time, we learned that Xie Tao is a member of the Hu Feng clique, which aroused our great anger and gave us a profound education. In the two semesters from the second half of 1953 to the first half of 1954, Xie Tao once served as a part-time teacher in our class for the course "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism." He lectured us on Marxism-Leninism in the classroom, and also spoke verbally about the despicable tricks of the anti-Party "August Alliance" and the Trotsky counter-revolutionary double-dealers; but he himself was secretly doing anti-Party and anti-people things. Today we realize that he was originally a counter-revolutionary double-dealer. He is opposing Marxism-Leninism in the guise of Marxism-Leninism, which is very shameless. We want to solemnly tell the members of the Hu Feng clique: you should take off your masks, reveal the truth, and help the Party thoroughly understand the entire situation of Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique, and from then on be a real person. This is the only way out.

We demand a thorough reckoning of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes, the revocation of his qualifications as a representative to the National People's Congress, and severe punishment according to law.

We have been deeply educated and have a deeper understanding of the sharpness and complexity of today's class struggle. The enemy has not laid down his weapons. They are attacking us at all times, trying to defeat us. We must raise our revolutionary vigilance, especially to guard against the enemy's counter-revolutionary double-dealing tricks, and wage unremitting struggle against the enemy. We are going to be propagandists of Marxism-Leninism. We must publicize and defend Marxism-Leninism, oppose distorting Marxism-Leninism, and even more oppose counter-revolutionary double-dealers who oppose Marxism-Leninism in the guise of Marxism-Leninism. We will be infinitely loyal to the Party and the cause of the Party, and under the wise leadership of the Party, we will use redoubled efforts to consolidate and develop our victory.

Letter from Bianjiang of Beijing Agricultural University: Hu Feng has revealed his true colors. He is not a "writer" or "revolutionary," but a conspirator, a counter-revolutionary element. He gained the trust of young people, instigated young people to break away from the revolution and the Party, and wooed young people to join his conspiracy clique to serve as his pawns. And he still hypocritically said, "I feel remorseful guilt for the young comrades who should have received better help from me." Does Hu Feng really feel "remorseful guilt"? In 1951, he also said, "I am sharpening my sword, watching the direction, and when I am sure, I am willing to cut off my head and throw it out to smash that dirty and smelly iron wall." In fact, this "iron wall" will never be smashed, but his head will really be smashed. This is probably what he feels "remorseful guilt" about. Because he failed to achieve the goal of destroying the lofty ideals and bright future of our young people, and failed to realize his counter-revolutionary conspiracy. Now we see Hu Feng's true face, a counter-revolutionary element who is hiding in the revolutionary camp in the guise of Marxism-Leninism. Precisely because we were deceived before and respected him, we now hate him even more. Our young students are very concerned about this struggle, and we demand that Hu Feng be punished by law. He is not only our ideological enemy, but also our political enemy. In addition to criticizing his ideology and eliminating the influence of his reactionary ideas, we must also give his clique a devastating blow politically.

The exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique is a great lesson for our young people. We cannot be too naive. We are working hard to build socialism and create a happy life, and at the same time we must be vigilant against the enemy's sabotage, especially the sabotage of hidden enemies.

Letter from Chen Dekun, a student of Tongji University: After reading the materials exposed by the "People's Daily" twice, I couldn't help but feel infinite anger. Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities have reached such a rampant point—he and his cronies planned and organized to undermine the revolution, break into the Party, enter revolutionary organizations to establish strongholds, expand "strength," "sharpen my sword, watch the direction," and wait for the restoration of the counter-revolutionary regime. He and his cronies are so arrogant that they even dare to slander our great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on literary and artistic work. Now the facts are very clear. Hu Feng is not only an ordinary politically reactionary element, but also the chief culprit of a planned and organized conspiracy sabotage clique. He has a set of strategies to break into revolutionary organizations to establish "strongholds," "win people," "engage in development work," and "greatly strengthen strength," and adopts hidden or double-dealing insidious means. Moreover, they also advocate a set of reactionary theories (such as "subjective combat spirit," "self-expansion," etc.).

In this event of exposing and reckoning with Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary conspiracy, I deeply feel the Party's infinite vitality and high degree of revolutionary vigilance. The Party has eliminated another obstacle for our socialist cause, especially clearing a scourge for the literary and artistic circles, and also washing away the shame of the literary and artistic circles, which will make our literary and artistic cause even more brilliant and make valuable contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland and the transformation of people's mental outlook.

Every young person who loves the cause of the Party and loves the motherland should maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and sensitivity to things like the Party. Young people have very little experience in struggle and social experience, and especially need the leadership and guidance of the Party. We young people should study even harder, especially learn from the Party's revolutionary struggle experience, so that we can maintain a clear head at all times in completing the tasks assigned to us by the Party and see through the sabotage activities of conspirators. Today, the class struggle is still so complex and intense. The sabotage activities of Hu Feng and his reactionary clique are only one of them. Only by highly raising our vigilance can we thwart any conspiracy of the enemy to sabotage the socialist cause of the motherland at any time, so as to ensure the victorious progress of the motherland's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation!

Letter from Zhong Chaodong and five other students of the second grade of the Chinese Department of Wuhan University: We condemn Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes with incomparable anger!

Hu Feng is a counter-revolutionary leader hidden in the revolutionary ranks. What he has done is no different from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. His actions to undermine the people's revolutionary cause and attempt to subvert the people's regime are exactly the same as those of Chiang bandit secret agents.

Hu Feng's destruction of the revolutionary cause over the past 20 years has been more insidious and vicious than that of Kuomintang secret agents, and more harmful. Because he disguised himself as a revolutionary, he has great deception. I don't know how many people he has deceived and poisoned. He used the most despicable and insidious means. He is a murderer who kills without shedding blood!

After liberation, Hu Feng became even more frantic. He slandered our Party, slandered our leaders, and slandered our literary and artistic circles; he slandered our Party for having "no expert in the field" of literature and art.

If Hu Feng is a human being, then he belongs to that handful of "people" in the world with bloody hands.

We demand that the People's Government arrest and bring the counter-revolutionary leader Hu Feng to justice! Every member of the Hu Feng clique must thoroughly explain everything, otherwise the people will not forgive them.

Letter from all the students of Class 4208 of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics: We denounce the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique with incomparable anger. After reading Hu Feng's two batches of secret letters, we clearly realized that Hu Feng is the most insidious enemy in our revolutionary ranks. Before this, we thought that Hu Feng was only too deeply poisoned by bourgeois ideology and was not easy to transform. Now we know that Hu Feng is the head of a consistently planned, organized, and programmed anti-Party and counter-revolutionary clique. He has an irreconcilable hatred for the Party and the revolution. He slandered the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which led the Chinese revolution to victory, as the "Board of Directors"; and slandered our revolutionary literary and artistic front as the "dirty and smelly iron wall." This really makes us extremely angry! We cannot tolerate, and we cannot let such a deadly enemy of the people continue to serve as a representative of the National People's Congress, and even more we cannot let him go unpunished. We suggest that the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng be given severe legal sanctions!

Letter from Peng Xing, Du Shiyun, and Jin Xiyu, students of military medical science at China Medical University in Shenyang: We are revolutionary soldiers from Sichuan. One of the sacred duties the people have given us is to discover and capture all American-Chiang secret agents and counter-revolutionary bandits who betray the motherland and are willing to be attached to the enemy. After we finished reading the materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party clique exposed by the "People's Daily," we unanimously believed that Hu Feng is this kind of heinous counter-revolutionary bandit.

The facts of the past 20 years have clearly proven that Hu Feng has long been a loyal minister and filial son of Chiang Kai-shek and a deadly enemy of the people. There are too many examples that can be cited; we all remember that Hu Feng wrote an article called "The Development and Efforts of Literary and Artistic Work," attacking the "Literary Association" led by the Party during the Anti-Japanese War. Now we have also discovered that Hu Feng has connections with the reactionary "Shishi Xinbao" and "Xinshu Bao."

The facts of the past 20 years have clearly proven that Hu Feng's profession is to oppose the Party, oppose the people, and oppose the revolution, lurking inside the revolution and acting as an "undercover." This is the specific task his master gave him. In order to attempt to strangle and wipe out the revolutionary literary and artistic movement, Hu Feng was "painstakingly" engaged in reactionary activities both before and after liberation. What Hu Feng made revolution against was not Chiang Kai-shek's life, but the life of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. Therefore, we must never let them make waves and harm the country and the people again!

Hu Feng is a representative to the National People's Congress elected by Sichuan. According to the Constitution, the people of Sichuan have the right to demand the revocation of his qualifications as a representative. How can the glorious people of Sichuan let Hu Feng, such a reactionary fellow, represent us again! For Hu Feng, we Sichuanese have only one feeling, which is hatred.

He is our enemy. If the enemy does not surrender, we will eliminate him!

Letter from all the students of Class Two, Grade One, Department of History, Nankai University, Tianjin: After reading the counter-revolutionary materials of the Hu Feng clique, we cannot suppress our anger. Under the guise of Marxism, Hu Feng once confused and influenced some people. We once thought that the Hu Feng issue was only an ideological issue, not a political issue. Now, the iron facts prove that Hu Feng is a political conspirator, and the struggle with Hu Feng is a serious political struggle.

For more than 20 years, Hu Feng has consistently engaged in anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary conspiratorial activities. Especially after liberation, they more planned and organized a frantic attack on the Party and the people. Hu Feng not only established strongholds in various places, but also sent his clique members to infiltrate the Party, steal Party documents, and inquire about news. This kind of criminal activity is intolerable. Hu Feng said, "I am willing to cut off my head and throw it out to smash that dirty and smelly iron wall." Facts have proved that the Party armed with Marxism-Leninism is invincible. It is not the revolution that has been "smashed," but their own counter-revolutionary "heads." What is even more hateful is that Hu Feng arranged for his cronies to retreat, attempting to continue to deceive the people with false "self-criticisms," and to "seek rebirth in endurance, everything is for the cause, for a more distant future." What is their "future"? It is to restore the counter-revolutionary regime. This is something the Chinese people will never allow. Hu Feng will never escape the net of the people. We support the resolution of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, and we must remove the counter-revolutionary leader Hu Feng from the revolutionary ranks. We must completely smash the Hu Feng clique.

Letter from Wang Zhengfang (Hani nationality), Pan Wenxiong (Miao nationality), Long Qixian (Tibetan nationality), and Asiru (Mongolian nationality), young people of minority nationalities from the Nationalities Department of the Central Communist Youth League School: Recently, we saw materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party clique in the "People's Daily," and we saw clearly the true face of the Hu Feng clique's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. We felt great indignation at their crimes.

The Hu Feng clique's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary conspiratorial activities and the reactionary ideas they spread have also brought great harm to the people of all ethnic groups and the youth of all ethnic groups. Under the reactionary rule of the old China, we suffered extremely. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, all ethnic groups have obtained equality in all rights, and young people of all ethnic groups have ample opportunities to give full play to their wisdom and talents to serve the motherland. We cannot tolerate the Hu Feng clique continuing to spread poison and deceive and paralyze us.

From the exposure of the Hu Feng clique's anti-Party crimes, we have learned a profound lesson: we must seriously study Marxism-Leninism, improve our level of Marxist-Leninist theory, raise our political vigilance, and resist the erosion of all bourgeois idealist reactionary ideas. We fully support the resolution of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on expelling Hu Feng from membership and revoking all his positions in the literary and artistic circles, and we suggest that the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers Association strictly supervise the members of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique to thoroughly confess their anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes.

Letter from Chen Jiazhen, Jiang Huiquan and ten other students from Jiangsu Medical College: We are a group of young medical educators and also literature and art lovers. Since the launch of the criticism of Hu Feng's thoughts, we have been very concerned about the development of this struggle. When we saw the materials of Hu Feng's anti-Party activities, we were greatly shocked and angered. It turned out that Hu Feng had been attacking the Party, the people, and the revolution for 20 years as if it was one day. They are "determined to coexist with the position." How determined they are to resist the people and the revolution to the end. We believe that Hu Feng, this anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary ambitious man, has lost the fundamental conditions for being a people of the People's Republic of China. We suggest that his qualification as a representative to the National People's Congress be revoked. From the struggle against the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, we have further recognized the Party's brilliance, vigilance, and the sharpness and complexity of the class struggle in the transition period. In the future, we will better study Marxism-Leninism, learn our profession well, and vigilantly monitor enemies appearing in any guise under the leadership of the Party, and fight to ensure the victory of the socialist revolution and to consolidate the Marxist-Leninist position!

Letter from Li Guang of Langtou Elementary School, Sixth District, Andong City, Liaoning Province: Hu Feng is not a writer, but an enemy of the people, a counter-revolutionary criminal. The secret letters that Hu Feng gave to his clique members fully show that he is a deadly enemy of the people. He said: "There are many things we have to endure, and only in endurance can we seek rebirth. Everything is for the cause, for a more distant future!" The meaning of "endurance" that Hu Feng said is to let his clique members lie dormant and attempt to carry out future subversion activities. He is our greatest enemy. We must never want this counter-revolutionary element in our revolutionary ranks. I suggest that Hu Feng's qualifications as a representative to the National People's Congress be revoked. Tell those who are wholeheartedly following Hu Feng that the only way out is to bow your heads and confess your guilt and thoroughly expose Hu Feng!

Letter from Yu Yuelong of Inner Mongolia Normal College: I am an educator on the Inner Mongolia prairie. After I saw Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" published in the People's Daily on May 13th and the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" on May 24th, I couldn't help but feel furious.

In the past, when we studied and criticized Hu Shi's and Hu Feng's thoughts, although we realized that this study was a serious and fierce class struggle on the ideological front during the transition period of the country, our understanding of Hu Feng as a person was very wrong. Many people here think this way: Hu Feng and Hu Shi have the same subjective idealism in philosophical views, but we must distinguish between Hu Feng and Hu Shi politically. Because Hu Shi is a No. 1 war criminal, a running dog of imperialism, and a public enemy of the Chinese people; while Hu Feng still has progressive aspects politically.

However, judging from the exposed materials, Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary nature is exactly the same as Hu Shi's, but one fled to the United States and the other lurked in China.

From the incident of the Hu Feng clique's anti-Party and counter-revolutionary activities, we should learn a lesson, redouble our vigilance in our work, improve our political sense of smell, and not give the enemy any chance to take advantage of. We must be prepared for battle at any time and place and wage a resolute struggle against all the enemy's conspiracies!

Letter from 43 students of the Sixth Preparatory Class of Renmin University of China: We feel extremely angry at the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

For more than 20 years, Hu Feng has spread many poisons among young people. Many young people have been deceived by their rhetoric and thought that Hu Feng was really a respectable "writer." Now we have completely seen through that he is the most despicable and vicious enemy, a murderer who kills without shedding blood.

We fully support: the resolution of the Joint Expanded Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, and request that Hu Feng's qualifications as a representative to the National People's Congress be revoked as soon as possible.

What is intolerable is that: in our school, there is still a shameful fellow, Xie Tao, who claims to promote Marxism-Leninism, but is actually "acting as an accomplice," a henchman of Hu Feng. Judging from the exposed materials, Hu Feng element Xie Tao is not only a loyal backbone member of the Hu Feng clique, but also a "theoretical" advisor to the Hu Feng clique.

It is so despicable for people like Xie Tao to instill poison in the future national construction talents in universities!

All our students unanimously believe that we must redouble our vigilance, thoroughly reckon with the conspiracies of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, and eliminate the poisons they spread among young people.

### 学校师生声讨胡风集团的罪行

专栏：

    学校师生声讨胡风集团的罪行
    中央民族学院副院长苏克勤、熊寿祺、教务长杨辛、研究部副主任夏康农等教学工作人员和行政工作人员六十一人来信：“人民日报”先后揭露了胡风写给他的党徒的两批密信，已经证实了胡风和胡风集团长期反党、反人民、反革命的罪恶行为。胡风是个二十多年来潜藏在革命队伍中进行阴谋破坏活动的最狠毒的恶棍。我们看到了他的无比丑恶和狰狞的面目，我们万分愤怒。我们今天特地举行了一次座谈会，一致声讨反革命恶棍胡风和胡风集团分子的反革命罪行。我们完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议所做的决议，我们认为它们是完全正确的。
    我们同样要求：
      一、全国人民代表大会常务委员会依据宪法第三十八条的规定，撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格。
      二、最高人民检察院对胡风的反革命罪行进行必要的处理。
    我们并警告胡风集团分子，必须站出来揭露胡风，批判自己，重新做人。
    北京大学中文系语言文学专业一年级全体学生来信：我们从去年暑假考入北京大学中文系，成为党在文化战线上的后备队伍。我们在学习的一开始，就坚定了为保卫党的文艺事业、为社会主义文化建设而斗争的信念，对我们来说，学习和斗争是不可分的。在揭露狡猾而顽固的敌人胡风的斗争中，我们要说出我们要说的话。
    郭沫若院长在“反社会主义的胡风纲领”一文中指出：在我国文艺界以至整个文化界，“再也找不出第二个像胡风那样顽强地坚持错误的文坛野心家了”，并且说：“到现在为止，我们还没有看到过一个完整的反党、反人民、反对社会主义建设和社会主义改造的资产阶级政治纲领，也许胡风的堂而皇之的文艺纲领就是它的一个影子吧？”这个评论是十分确切的。事实证明，胡风在公开提出他的 “纲领”前，曾动员了反动集团中的一切主要力量参加了准备、起草工作，并在各地“据点”里组织了讨论，把它作为胡风集团共同的思想、行动纲领和必须“遵守”的“组织原则”。因而胡风的“野心”和“纲领”已决不是仅属于文艺思想领域内的问题，而是一个具有严重政治性的反动的罪恶阴谋，是革命同反革命的营垒对峙的问题。
    胡风向党和人民打了十几年的“冲锋”。他不仅有一套理论基础和“组织原则”，还有完整的战略战术方案，甚至连一切反革命集团惯于使用的隐语、代号，及各种最卑鄙的流氓手段，胡风也毫不走样地用上了。因此当我们读了“人民日报”揭露的胡风材料后，我们不禁又回忆起了前些时参观的“美国空投特务罪证展览”。的确，把胡风的信件放到那里去，可以说是毫无逊色的。胡风及其反动集团在解放前和解放后的阴谋活动，不仅在实质上是和以蒋介石为首的反革命集团一脉相通，如出一辙的，而且在具体做法及战略战术的变化上，胡风也是努力做到了和他们里外呼应，进退一致的。
    北京大学中文系全体师生和全校师生及全国文化界一道，在党的领导下进行了一个时期的批判胡适反动思想的斗争，最近在系科学讨论会上提出的占三分之二以上的批判胡适的论文，标志了这一斗争的初步胜利；今后我们要同全系老师同学一道，在党的领导下继续开展对胡风及其反动集团的斗争，以便彻底肃清他在青年中所散布的有害影响。
    中国人民大学统计系三年级第三班同学杨应麟、邱维钢、易昌惠等二十九人来信：我们以极端愤怒的心情看完了“人民日报”揭露胡风反党集团的两批材料。六亿中国人民衷心爱戴拥护自己的救星——我们的党和毛主席，完全信任并永远忠实于党和毛主席规定的一切政策和路线（包括文艺路线），因为它们是千真万确的真理，历史的事实证明了它们是无往不胜的。然而以胡风为首的这帮阴谋家，却要把矛头指向革命，指向人民，指向党和毛主席，指向党所领导的文艺工作。他们进行的鬼鬼祟祟的破坏性的阴谋活动，是千千万万中国人民所不能允许的。
    我们要求严厉惩办这群反党反革命分子，要求彻底清查他们的罪恶，揭示于全国人民面前。我们完全同意各界人士关于撤销胡风一切职务以及撤销他的全国人民代表大会代表资格的建议。我们警告胡风反党集团的党羽们，该是你们低头认罪，并向人民彻底坦白交代你们罪状的时候了。
    正如“人民日报”编者所指出的，我们要在各方面工作中提高警惕，揭露那些表面拥护我们实际上反对我们的反革命分子。我们也很清楚地知道，一切反动的力量，一切公开的暗藏的反革命敌人，无论他们多么刁猾阴险，但在我们党面前、在我们伟大中国人民面前，总是要碰得头破血流，彻底失败的，这次胡风反党集团的被揭露也正是我们的一次胜利。
    北京师范大学政治教育系二年级全体同学来信：胡风反党集团顽固地反抗党所领导的革命文艺运动，企图夺取文艺阵线的领导权，以反党反人民反革命的胡风的文艺路线来代替马克思主义的文艺路线，以达到其不可告人的目的，他实际上是在和蒋介石密切配合着对人民革命进攻。胡风对党和人民是恨之入骨的，为了反党反人民，他甚至愿意割下头颅抛掷出去，这就是胡风彻底反对革命的面目。
    在这次公布的材料中，我们知道了谢韬是胡风集团的一员，引起我们极大的愤怒，也使我们受到深刻的教育。在一九五三年下半年到一九五四年上半年两学期，谢韬曾经在我班兼任“马克思列宁主义基础”课，他在课堂上给我们讲马克思列宁主义，口头上也讲反党的“八月联盟”和托洛茨基反革命两面派的卑鄙手腕；而他自己却暗地里这样做着反党反人民的勾当。今天我们认识到他原来就是个反革命的两面派。他是披着马克思列宁主义的外衣来反对马克思列宁主义，这是非常无耻的。我们要正告胡风集团分子：你们应该剥去假面，揭露真相，帮助党彻底弄清胡风及其反党集团的全部情况，从此做个真正的人，这是唯一的出路。
    我们要求彻底清算胡风反革命的罪恶，撤销他全国人民代表大会代表的资格，依照法律，给以严厉惩办。
    我们深深受到了教育，更深刻地认识到今天阶级斗争的尖锐和复杂，敌人是没有放下武器的，他们时时刻刻地在进攻着我们，企图打倒我们，我们要提高革命警惕性，特别要提防敌人的反革命两面派的伎俩，和敌人作不懈的斗争。我们将要作为马克思列宁主义的宣传员，我们要宣传和捍卫马克思列宁主义，反对歪曲马克思列宁主义，更反对披着马克思列宁主义的外衣来反对马克思列宁主义的反革命两面派。我们要无限忠诚于党和党的事业，在党英明的领导下，用加倍的努力来巩固和发展我们的胜利。
    北京农业大学边疆来信：胡风原形毕露了，他哪里是什么“作家”“革命家”，他是阴谋家，是反革命分子。他骗取青年的信任，教唆青年脱离革命，脱离党，拉拢青年入他的阴谋集团，充当他的走卒。而他还在假惺惺地说什么，“我对于应该从我得到较好的帮助的青年同志们感到了悔恨性的内疚”。胡风真的感到“悔恨性的内疚”么？一九五一年他还说“我在磨我的剑，窥测方向，到我看准了的时候，我愿意割下我的头颅抛掷出去，把那个脏臭的铁壁击碎的”。其实，这个“铁壁”是永远也击不碎的，而他的头颅却真的要击碎的。大概这就是他所感到的“悔恨性的内疚”。因为他没有能达到破坏我们青年的远大理想和美好前途的目的，未能实现他反革命的阴谋。现在我们看清胡风的真面目了，一个披着马克思列宁主义外衣隐藏在革命阵营内部的反革命分子。正因为我们以前受了骗，尊敬他，现在就更加仇恨他。我们青年同学都非常关心这一场斗争，我们要求给胡风以法律制裁。他不仅是我们思想上的敌人，也是政治上的敌人，我们除了批判他的思想，肃清他的反动思想影响之外，还必须在政治上给他的集团以毁灭性的打击。
    胡风反党集团的阴谋被揭露，对我们青年是个极大的教训，我们不能太天真了。我们努力建设社会主义，创造幸福的生活，同时还必须警惕敌人的破坏，特别是暗藏敌人的破坏。
    同济大学学生陈德坤来信：看了“人民日报”两次揭发的材料后，不禁感到无限愤怒，胡风的反党反人民反革命的活动已经到了如此猖狂的地步——他和他的党羽们有计划有组织地破坏革命，打入党内，打进革命团体内建立据点，扩充“实力”，“磨我的剑，窥测方向”，等待反革命政权的复辟，他和他所指挥的党羽们是如此嚣张，甚至敢于污蔑我们伟大的领袖毛主席对文艺工作的指示。现在事实已经很清楚，胡风已不仅是一般的政治上的反动分子，而是一个有计划有组织的阴谋破坏集团的首恶分子，有一套打进革命团体内建立“据点”、“争取人”、“从事开辟工作”、“大大地加强实力”的策略，采取隐蔽的或两面派的阴险手段，而且他们还鼓吹着一套反动理论（什么“主观战斗精神”“自我扩张”等等）。
    在这次揭露和清算胡风的反革命阴谋的事件中，我更深深感到党的无限生命力和高度的革命警惕性。党又为我们的社会主义事业扫除了一道障碍，特别是为文艺界清除了一个祸害，也是洗去文艺界的耻辱，这将会使我们的文艺事业更加发扬光大，为祖国的社会主义建设，为改造人们的精神面貌作出有价值的贡献。
    我们每个热爱党的事业、热爱祖国的青年都应该像党那样保持高度的革命警惕性，和对事物的敏感性，青年人的斗争经验和社会经验是很少的，特别需要党的领导和指示。我们青年人应该更加紧地学习，特别是学习党的革命斗争经验，以便在完成党所交给我们的任务中，能随时保持清醒头脑，识破阴谋分子的破坏活动，今天阶级斗争还是如此复杂和剧烈地进行着，胡风及其反动集团的破坏活动还只是其中之一，我们唯有高度地提高警惕，才能随时挫败敌人任何破坏祖国社会主义事业的阴谋，以保证祖国社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业的胜利进行！
    武汉大学中文系二年级学生锺朝栋等六人来信：我们以无比愤怒的心情，来斥责胡风反党、反人民、反革命的罪行！
    胡风是隐藏在革命队伍里的反革命头子，他的所作所为和蒋介石匪帮没有什么区别，他对人民的革命事业进行破坏和企图颠覆人民政权的行为，完全和蒋匪特务一样。
    胡风二十年来，对革命事业的破坏，比国民党特务还要阴险毒辣，危害性更大。因为他伪装着革命，有极大的欺骗性。不知他欺骗和毒害了多少人。他用的是最卑鄙最阴险的手段，他是杀人不见血的！
    解放后，胡风更疯狂了。他污蔑我们党，污蔑我们领袖，污蔑我们文艺界；他污蔑我们党对文艺“无内行专家”。
    如果说胡风是人，那么他是属于世界上那一小撮满手血腥的那类“人”。
    我们要求人民政府把反革命头子胡风逮捕法办！胡风集团的每个分子必须彻底交代清楚，否则人民不能饶恕他们。
    北京航空学院四二○八班全体同学来信：我们怀着无比愤怒的心情，来声讨胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动。我们看了胡风的两批密信，使我们清楚地认识了胡风是我们革命队伍中最阴险的敌人。在这以前，我们还以为胡风不过是受资产阶级思想的毒害太深，不易接受改造，现在我们才知道胡风是一个一贯有计划、有组织、有纲领的反党反革命的集团的头子。他对党对革命有着不共戴天的仇恨，他把领导中国革命走向胜利的中国共产党中央委员会诬蔑为“董事会”；把我们的革命的文艺阵线诬蔑为“脏臭的铁壁”。这真使我们愤怒万分！我们不能容忍，不能再让这样的人民的死敌再作为全国人民代表大会的代表，更不能让他逍遥法外。我们建议对反革命分子胡风予以严厉的法律制裁！
    沈阳中国医科大学军医期学员彭兴、杜世云、金锡御来信：我们是四川籍的革命军人。人民给予我们的神圣职责之一，就是要发现和擒拿一切背叛祖国，甘心附敌的美蒋特务和反革命匪徒。当我们读完了“人民日报”揭发出来的关于胡风反党集团的材料以后，我们一致认为：胡风就是这种万恶的反革命匪徒。
    二十年来的事实，已清楚地证明，胡风早就是蒋介石的忠臣孝子，人民的死敌。可以举出来的例子是太多了；我们都还记得胡风写过一篇叫“文艺工作的发展及其努力方向”的文章，攻击抗战中党所领导的“文协”。现在我们又发现了，胡风和反动的“时事新报”、“新蜀报”有着联系。
    二十年来的事实，已清楚地证明：胡风的职业就是反党、反人民、反革命，潜伏在革命内部，充当“暗探”，这就是他的主子给他的具体任务。为了企图绞杀和剿灭革命文艺运动，胡风无论在解放前或解放后，都是“呕心镂骨”地在进行反动活动。胡风所革的不是蒋介石的命，而是中国共产党和中国人民的命。因此绝不能再让他们兴风作浪，祸国殃民！
    胡风是四川选出来的全国人民代表大会代表。根据宪法规定，我们四川人民有权要求撤销他的代表资格。光荣的四川人民，怎能再让胡风这种反动家伙来代表我们！对于胡风，我们四川人，只有一个感情，就是仇恨。
    他是我们的敌人，如果敌人不投降，就消灭他！
    天津南开大学历史系一年级二班全体同学来信：看了胡风集团反革命的材料，难以抑止我们的愤怒。胡风在马克思主义的外衣掩盖下，曾经迷惑和影响过一些人，我们曾认为胡风问题仅仅是思想问题，而不是政治问题。现在，铁的事实证明胡风是个政治阴谋家，同胡风的斗争，是个严重的政治斗争。
    胡风二十多年来，一贯进行反党、反人民、反革命的阴谋活动，特别在解放后，他们更有计划、有组织地向党向人民进行猖狂进攻。胡风不仅在各地建立据点，并且派遣他的集团分子混进党内，偷窃党内文件，探听消息，这种罪恶活动是使人难以容忍的。胡风说“我愿意割下我的头颅抛掷出去，把那个脏臭的铁壁击碎的。”事实已经证明，以马克思列宁主义武装的党是战无不胜的，被“击碎”的不是革命，正是他们自己的反革命“头颅”。更令人切齿痛恨的是：胡风布置他的党羽退却，企图以假
  “检讨”继续欺骗人民，要“在忍受中求得重生，一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来”。他们的
  “未来”是什么？是想把反革命政权复辟。这是中国人民决不能容许的。胡风绝对逃不出人民的天罗地网。我们拥护中国文联和中国作家协会主席团的决议，一定要把反革命头子胡风，从革命队伍中清除出去。一定要彻底粉碎胡风集团。
    中央团校民族部少数民族青年王正芳（哈伲族）、潘文雄（苗族）、龙启贤（藏族）、阿斯儒（蒙族）来信：最近我们在“人民日报”上看到揭露胡风反党集团的材料，看清了胡风集团反党反人民反革命的真正面目，对他们的罪行感到极大的愤慨。
    胡风集团反党反人民反革命的阴谋活动及其散播的反动思想，也曾给各族人民和各族青年带来极大毒害。在旧中国反动统治下，我们苦极了，今天在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，各民族已经得到一切权利上的平等，各民族青年都有充分发挥自己的智慧和才能为祖国服务的机会。我们不能容忍胡风集团继续散播毒素，欺骗麻痹我们。
    从揭露胡风集团反党罪行当中，我们得到一个深刻的教训：我们必须认真学习马克思列宁主义，提高自己的马克思列宁主义理论水平，提高政治警惕性，抵制一切资产阶级唯心主义反动思想的侵蚀。我们完全拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议关于开除胡风会籍并撤销他在文艺界一切职务的决议，并建议中国文联和中国作家协会，严格督促胡风反党集团分子彻底交代他们的反党反人民反革命的罪行。
    江苏医学院陈家震、蒋慧权等十一人来信：我们是一群年青的医学教育工作者，也是文艺爱好者。从展开对胡风思想批判以后，我们一直很关心这一斗争的开展。当我们看到了胡风反党的材料后，使我们感到极大的震惊与愤怒。原来胡风竟是二十年如一日地在向党向人民向革命进攻。他们“抱着与阵地共存亡的决心”，这是多么坚决地想同人民和革命顽抗到底。我们认为胡风这个反党反人民反革命的野心家，已失去了作为中华人民共和国人民的根本条件。我们建议，撤销他全国人民代表大会的代表资格。我们从对胡风反党集团的斗争中，更进一步地认识到党的英明、警觉，认识到过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐复杂。今后我们要在党的领导下更好地学习马克思列宁主义，学好业务，百倍警惕地监视以任何面目出现的敌人，为确保社会主义革命的胜利，为巩固马克思列宁主义的阵地而斗争！
    辽宁省安东市第六区浪头小学李光来信：胡风不是作家，而是人民的敌人，反革命罪犯。胡风给他那些集团分子的密信，完全表明他是人民的死对头。他说：“有许多事情我们得忍受，并且只有在忍受中求得重生，一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来！”胡风所说的“忍受”的意思，就是让他那些集团分子好好潜伏下来，企图进行未来的颠覆活动。他是我们最大的敌人。在我们革命队伍里绝不能要这个反革命分子。我建议撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会的代表资格。告诉那些死心踏地追随胡风的人，只有低头认罪，彻底揭露胡风，才是唯一的出路！
    内蒙古师范学院俞越龙来信：我是内蒙古草原上的一个教育工作者。我看到了人民日报在五月十三日刊载的舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”以及五月二十四日“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”后，不禁令人发指。
    过去，在我们学习批判胡适、胡风思想的时候，我们虽认识到这次学习是在国家过渡时期思想战线上的一场严重的激烈的阶级斗争，但我们对胡风这个人的认识是很错误的。我们这里有许多人都这样认为：胡风和胡适在哲学观点上的错误是一样的主观唯心论，但对于胡风和胡适这两个人在政治上必须区别开来。因为胡适是头号战犯、帝国主义的走狗、是中国人民的公敌；而胡风在政治上还有他进步的地方。
    可是从揭发的材料看，胡风的反革命本质是同胡适一模一样，不过是一个逃亡在美国，一个潜伏在中国。
    从胡风集团反党反革命的事件中，我们应该吸取教训，在我们的工作中要加倍地提高警惕，提高我们的政治嗅觉，不让敌人有可乘之机。我们要随时随地作好战斗准备，同敌人的一切阴谋进行坚决斗争！
    中国人民大学预科第六班四十三人来信：胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动，使我们感到无比愤恨。
    胡风二十多年来，在青年中散布了许多毒素。有不少青年曾被他们的花言巧语所欺骗，以为胡风真的是一个可敬的“作家”。现在我们完全看透了他是最卑鄙、最凶恶的敌人，是杀人不见血的凶手。
    我们完全拥护：中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，并要求早日撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会的代表资格。
    不能容忍的是：在我们的学校里，还有一个可耻的家伙谢韬，以宣传马克思列宁主义自居，实际上是“为虎作伥”，追随胡风的帮凶。从揭露的材料看，胡风分子谢韬不仅是胡风集团的忠实的骨干分子，而且又是胡风集团的“理论”顾问。
    像谢韬这样的人，在高等学校里，对未来的国家建设人材灌输毒素，这是多么卑鄙！
    我们全体同学一致认为：要百倍提高警惕，彻底清算胡风反党集团的阴谋诡计，肃清他们在青年中所散布的毒素。
