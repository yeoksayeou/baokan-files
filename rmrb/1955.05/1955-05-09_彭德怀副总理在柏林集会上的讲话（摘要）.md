Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 8th: Peng Dehuai, head of the Chinese government delegation participating in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of Germany's liberation and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech at the rally celebrating the 10th anniversary of Germany's liberation in Berlin on the afternoon of May 7th. The following is a summary:

　　In 1945, the heroic Soviet army completely defeated the Hitler fascist gang and achieved complete victory in the anti-fascist war, which fundamentally changed the world situation. From then on, the German people were freed from the chains of Hitler's fascist enslavement and embarked on the glorious road of fighting for the independence, unity, peace, and democracy of their motherland, and established the German Democratic Republic in the course of this struggle.

　　The German Democratic Republic is peace-loving and has always adhered to a peaceful foreign policy. It has become a strong fortress for the German people to strive for the unification, peace, democracy, and independence of their motherland. The government of the German Democratic Republic is playing an increasingly important role in the cause of striving for the peace and unity of the motherland, striving to guarantee European collective security, and safeguarding world peace.

　　The American aggressive bloc and its followers have consistently violated international agreements concerning the settlement of the German question, pursuing a policy of splitting Germany, reviving German militarism, and dragging West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive military bloc. They attempt to turn Germany into a new source of war in Europe once again, and make the West German people cannon fodder in their future war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Disregarding the interests of the German people, and disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and peace-loving people all over the world, they signed and ratified the Paris Agreements. This has made the situation in Europe more tense, seriously damaged the cause of restoring German unity through free elections, and greatly increased the danger of a new war.

　　The aim of the American aggressive bloc is to dominate the world. To this end, they are actively preparing to launch a new world war. Arming West Germany is a major step in their war plan. In addition, the American aggressive bloc is also attempting to intensify the arming of Japan in Asia, and has established the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and organized the Turkey-Pakistan and Turkey-Iraq military alliances. American imperialism has forcibly occupied China's territory of Taiwan, established many military bases aimed at attacking the People's Republic of China on China's east and southeast sides, and threatened to wage atomic war against the Chinese people.

　　However, the current world situation and its development trend are not conducive to the aggressive forces of imperialism. They underestimate the strength of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp. In fact, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries not only possess powerful forces to defend their own territories, but these countries are closely united for the lofty goals of world peace and human progress, and standing with them are peace-loving people all over the world. Therefore, as Chairman Mao Zedong said, "If imperialism launches a war of aggression, we and the people of the world must wipe them off the face of the earth!"

　　The People's Republic of China fully agrees with and supports all necessary measures taken by the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and other European people's democratic countries to ensure their own security and European peace. Six hundred million Chinese people will fully support the German people in their just struggle for the peace, democracy, and unity of their motherland.

　　The fraternal friendship between the Chinese and German people is growing and consolidating, and representatives of the two countries have close exchanges. The continuous development of the fraternal and cooperative relations between our two peoples not only conforms to the interests of the peaceful construction of our two countries, but also has great significance for strengthening and consolidating the world's peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

　　Finally, Peng Dehuai read out the congratulatory messages from the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the State Council.

　　彭德怀副总理在柏林集会上的讲话（摘要）
    新华社柏林八日电　我国参加德国解放十周年庆祝典礼的政府代表团团长、国务院副总理彭德怀七日下午在柏林举行的庆祝德国解放十周年大会上讲话，摘要如下：
    一九四五年英雄的苏联军队彻底击败了希特勒法西斯匪帮，取得了反法西斯战争的完全胜利，这就使世界形势发生了根本的变化。从此，德国人民摆脱了希特勒法西斯奴役的锁链，走上了为自己祖国的独立、统一、和平、民主而斗争的光荣道路，并在这一斗争的过程中建立了德意志民主共和国。
    德意志民主共和国是热爱和平的，它始终坚持着和平的外交政策。它已成为德国人民争取祖国统一、和平、民主和独立的坚强堡垒。德意志民主共和国政府在争取祖国的和平和统一、争取保障欧洲集体安全和维护世界和平的事业中起着日益重大的作用。
    美国侵略集团及其追随者一贯地违反有关解决德国问题的国际协定，执行着分裂德国，复活德国军国主义，并把西德拉入北大西洋侵略性军事集团的政策。企图把德国再一次变成欧洲新战争的策源地，使西德人民成为它们未来反苏、反人民民主国家战争中的炮灰。它们不顾德国人民的利益，不顾苏联、人民民主国家和全世界爱好和平人民的反对，签订和批准了巴黎协定。这就使欧洲的形势更加紧张，使通过自由选举以恢复德国统一的事业遭到严重破坏，使新战争的危险大大增加。
    美国侵略集团的目的是要称霸世界。为此，它们正在积极准备着发动新的世界大战。武装西德正是它们战争计划中的一个重大步骤。此外，美国侵略集团在亚洲也正在企图加紧武装日本，并建立了东南亚侵略集团，组织了土耳其—巴基斯坦和土耳其—伊拉克军事同盟。美帝国主义用武力侵占了中国的领土台湾，在中国的东面和东南面建立了许多旨在进攻中华人民共和国的军事基地，并威胁着要对中国人民进行原子战争。
    但是，当前的世界形势及其发展的趋势，并不是有利于帝国主义的侵略势力的。它们低估了和平民主社会主义阵营的力量。实际上，苏联和各人民民主国家不仅拥有保卫自己领土的强大的力量，而且这些国家是为了世界和平和人类进步的崇高目标而紧密地团结在一起的，同它们站在一起的，还有全世界爱好和平的人民。因此，正像毛泽东主席所说的，“只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”
    中华人民共和国完全同意和支持苏联、德意志民主共和国和其他欧洲人民民主国家为保障自身安全和欧洲和平所采取的一切必要措施。六亿中国人民将全力支持德国人民为争取自己祖国的和平、民主、统一的正义斗争。
    中德两国人民之间的兄弟友谊在日益发展和巩固，两国代表有着密切的往来。我们两国人民兄弟般友好合作关系的不断发展，不仅符合于我们两国人民和平建设的利益，而且对加强和巩固以苏联为首的世界和平民主社会主义阵营也有重大的意义。
    彭德怀最后宣读了中华人民共和国主席、全国人民代表大会常务委员会和国务院的祝词。
