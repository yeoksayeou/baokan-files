The only correct way to rectify the work of unified grain sales is to announce supply quotas, rely on the masses to conduct democratic appraisal, and then issue grain purchase certificates, with supplies provided on time upon presentation of the certificates. Some regions have adopted practices such as comprehensive surplus-deficit adjustments, across-the-board reductions in supply figures, and the universal recall of issued grain purchase certificates. These practices are incorrect and will not yield good results.

Some staff members, seeing that many people were requesting grain supplies, did not distinguish between genuine and false claims and simply assumed that the state's allocated supply quota for the area was too low. They wanted to ask their superiors to increase the supply quota, but they were afraid of being criticized. Therefore, they tried to get grain from farmers who still had a surplus. If state grain markets were well-managed and ideological education was carried out effectively, attracting farmers with surplus grain or those needing to adjust varieties to sell and adjust grain in state grain markets, that would of course be permissible. However, in many places, adjustments were not made through the market but by coercing people with more grain to "adjust" it to those who lacked grain, which is wrong. In Jinnaxiang, Third District, Baojing County, Hunan, several meetings were held to repeatedly "mobilize" farmers who still had surplus grain to "adjust" it to grain-deficient households; this "mobilization" was in fact coercive. Some staff members in Baojing County even regarded this as a "successful experience" and promoted it, with as many as seventy-seven townships across the county adopting this approach. Staff members in some counties of Jinhua Prefecture, Zhejiang, would "expose and criticize" farmers who still had surplus grain and arbitrarily label them; in some villages, "grain searches" even occurred. Majian Township in Lanxi County even displayed the "searched" grain at supply points, considering it a "good experience." Provinces such as Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Guangxi also promoted this incorrect approach to rectify the unified grain sales work in many places. Doing so easily infringes upon the interests of middle peasants and causes chaos in rural areas. In many villages in Baojing County, Hunan, after the implementation of the "three fixings" policy for grain, farmers were actively and peacefully engaged in production; after the "adjustment" of grain, many farmers doubted whether the "three fixings" still counted and became uneasy again. Moreover, the result of doing so inevitably increases artificial tension in rural areas and does not truly solve the current grain supply problem; in some places in Jinhua Prefecture, after adopting this approach to rectify the unified grain sales work, even more people were requesting grain supplies.

Across-the-board reductions in supply figures are even more incorrect. Since the original allocation of supply figures was unreasonable, the result of across-the-board reductions will inevitably remain unreasonable. Doing so may superficially "complete the task"; in reality, the problem is not solved, grain-deficient people become even more grain-deficient, and the unified sales problem becomes even more serious.

Some places in the past did not clearly understand the situation of grain-deficient households, nor did they conduct truly fair and reasonable appraisals before issuing grain purchase certificates, issuing them very unreasonably. When rectifying the unified sales work, upon discovering that some people who had received certificates were not actually grain-deficient, they hastily took blunt measures to recall all grain purchase certificates. Doing so will inevitably deepen the ideological concerns of the masses and create even greater chaos. In areas where grain purchase certificates have already been issued, it is necessary to conduct a review, but it is absolutely impermissible to abandon the original foundation, and it is necessary to rely on the masses to fully understand the situation and conduct ideological education. Only those who absolutely do not need supplies and will not need supplies in the future can be persuaded to return their grain purchase certificates through education. For those who do not need so much, the numbers can be changed on the original certificate; for those who do not need to buy early, the dates can be changed on the original certificate. Recalling all grain purchase certificates is inappropriate and unnecessary.

    强迫命令一定把事情办坏
　　杨叶
    整顿粮食统销工作的唯一正确的方法是宣布供应指标，依靠群众进行民主评议，然后核发购粮证，凭证按时供应。有些地区采取了全面进行余缺调剂、平均削减供应数字、普遍收回已发的购粮证等等做法。这是不正确的，是不可能收到良好结果的。
    有的工作人员看到要求供应粮食的人很多，他们不去分别其中的虚假现象，就认为国家分配给当地的供应指标太低；他们想要求上级提高供应指标，又怕受到批评；于是，就在还有余粮的农民身上打主意。如果把国家粮食市场办好，把思想教育工作做好，吸引有余粮的和需要调剂品种的农民到国家粮食市场上出卖和调剂粮食，那当然是可以的。可是，很多地方并不是通过市场进行调剂，而是强迫粮食较多的人“调剂”给缺粮的人，这就错误了。湖南保靖县第三区金那乡召开了几次大会，反复“动员”仍有余粮的农户把余粮“调剂”给缺粮户；这种“动员”实际上带有强迫命令的性质。保靖县的一些工作人员还把这当成“成功的经验”加以推广，全县竟有七十七个乡采用了这种办法。浙江金华专区有些县的工作人员看到哪些农民仍有余粮就进行“揭发批判”乱扣帽子；有些乡村还发生了“搜仓”的事情。兰溪县马涧乡还把“搜”出的粮食放在供应点展览，认为这是一条“好经验”。吉林、黑龙江、广西等省也有不少地方推行这种不正确的办法来整顿粮食统销工作。这样做，很容易侵犯中农利益，引起农村中的混乱。湖南保靖县的许多乡村，在贯彻粮食“三定”政策以后，农民正在积极地安心地进行生产；“调剂”粮食以后，许多农民怀疑
  “三定”究竟是不是算数，心里又不安起来了。而且，这样做的结果，势必增加农村中人为的紧张空气，并不能真正解决当前的粮食供应问题；金华专区有些地方在采取这种做法整顿粮食统销工作以后，要求供应粮食的人反而更多了。
    平均削减供应数字，更是一种不正确的做法。原来的供应数字的分配既是不合理的，平均削减的结果必然仍是不合理。这样做，表面上也许能够“完成任务”；实际上问题并没有解决，缺粮的人更加缺粮，统销问题会更加严重。
    有些地方过去没有把缺粮户的情况了解清楚，没有经过真正公平合理的评议，就把购粮证发了，发得很不合理。在整顿统销工作的时候，一发现有些领了证的人并不缺粮，就急忙采取生硬的手段把购粮证一律收回。这样做，必然会加深群众的思想顾虑，造成更大的混乱。在已发过购粮证的地区，进行复核是必要的，但是决不可抛开原来的基础，并且必须依靠群众，充分地做好了解情况的工作和思想教育工作，在宣布供应指标后仍应让群众充分酝酿讨论。只有完全不需要供应、今后也不需要供应的，才可以经过教育说服令他们把购粮证退回。不需要那么多的，可以就原证改变数字；不需要早买的，可以就原证改变日期。一律追回购粮证是不妥当也不必要的。
