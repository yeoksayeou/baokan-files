　　Thoroughly Crush the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique
　　Shen Zhiyuan
　　Anyone with a genuine sense of revolutionary justice cannot help but express extreme indignation after reading Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique." If, before the publication of these materials, many people (including myself) thought that the criticism of Hu Feng was merely an ideological struggle within literary and academic circles against anti-Marxist, subjective idealism, then now everyone can fully understand that the struggle against Hu Feng is a question of whether we support the leadership of the Communist Party and whether we want to safeguard the interests of the people and the cause of the revolution. The materials revealed by Shu Wu powerfully tell everyone: What a sinister, malicious, and reactionary face Hu Feng and his clique possess! The activities of Hu Feng and his clique over the past twenty years have been, from beginning to end, a conspiratorial activity against the Party, against the people, and against the revolution. Therefore, we must loudly call for the attention of the people of the whole country! Today's struggle against the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique is by no means just a matter for literary and academic circles, but a matter for all the people; this is not just a matter of ideological error, but a serious political issue.
　　For twenty years, Hu Feng's gun has been aimed at the Communist Party and the cause of the revolution. We must not be deceived by Hu Feng's false self-criticism. We must thoroughly expose his conspiracy of advancing by retreating.
　　Hu Feng and his clique's anti-Party and counter-revolutionary activities have a complete set of strategies and tactics. Their "strategic" goal "is to shake the twenty years of mechanistic rule," meaning to break through the Party's ideological and organizational leadership of revolutionary literary and artistic work. Their "tactics" are diverse: what "perfunctoriness," what "accompanying the dance," what using "the tactics of cluster grenades," what using a whip of "rubber-coated steel wire" that "injures but leaves no visible scars," deliberately creating "a situation of suspicion, so that they (referring to the Party and non-Party progressive writers) see flags all over the mountains and dare not easily attack," establishing "small strongholds" in reactionary newspapers under pseudonyms, "liaison personnel," "winning over people" to "greatly strengthen their strength," and so on. And the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique has consistently maintained a stubborn, hostile attitude towards the Party and the revolutionary literary and artistic ranks, refusing to "compromise," not "discouraging," launching "attacks," and being determined to "coexist with the position."
　　What else is there to say now? Now, every one of us who truly supports the Communist Party and the cause of the revolution should clarify one question: based on the above facts, can the struggle against the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique still be considered a problem within the revolutionary camp? This question is now very clearly placed before us.
　　Today, when enemies at home and abroad are openly or secretly intensifying their conspiracies to sabotage our socialist revolution, we must raise our vigilance a hundredfold and thoroughly expose the conspiracy of the Hu Feng Clique, which attempts to disintegrate and sabotage from within the revolutionary ranks and from within the people. We must combine the struggle against the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique with the implementation of the general task of the state during the transition period and the general struggle against enemies at home and abroad. To separate and isolate this serious struggle to expose Hu Feng from the aspect of defending the entire socialist construction and socialist revolution would be to narrow the scope of this struggle and reduce its significance, and therefore it is incorrect. In short, the struggle we are currently waging against the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique is a very serious class struggle in the country's socialist road, and this is a struggle related to the entire revolutionary interest. We must thoroughly expose and smash all the conspiracies of the Hu Feng Clique against the Party, against the people, and against the revolution! We must demand that everyone in the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique hand over all secret letters, and like Shu Wu, make an honest self-criticism to the people, and quickly surrender to the people!

　　彻底粉碎胡风的反党集团
　　沈志远
    只要真正具有一点革命正义感的人，读了舒芜
  “关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”，是不能不表示极度愤慨的。假使说，在这些材料公布以前，很多人（包括我在内）都以为批判胡风只是文艺学术界对于反马克思主义的主观唯心主义的思想斗争的问题，那末现在大家可以完全明白了，对胡风的斗争是一个我们拥护不拥护共产党的领导、要不要卫护人民的利益和革命事业的问题。舒芜所揭发的材料有力地告诉大家：胡风及其集团具有一副多么阴险、多么恶毒、多么反动的狰狞面貌！胡风及其集团二十年来的活动，彻头彻尾地是反对党、反对人民、反对革命的阴谋活动。因此，我们要大声疾呼地唤起全国人民的注意！今天对胡风反党集团的斗争，决不光是文艺学术界的事，而且是全体人民的事；这不光是一个思想错误的问题，而且是一个严重的政治问题。
    二十年来，胡风的枪口一直是对准着共产党、对准着革命事业的。我们决不可被胡风的假检讨所迷惑。我们要彻底地揭露他的以退为进的阴谋。
    胡风及其集团的反党、反革命的活动是有整套的战略战术的。他们的“战略”目标“是要动摇二十年的机械论的统治势力”，意思就是要攻破党对革命文艺工作的思想领导和组织领导。他们的“战术”是多种多样的：什么“敷衍”呀，“奉陪一道跳加官”呀，什么用“集束手榴弹的战法”呀，用“打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”的“橡皮包着钢丝”的鞭子抽打呀，故布“疑阵，使他们（指党和非党进步作家）看来遍山旗帜，不敢轻易来犯”呀，化名在反动报纸上建立“小据点”呀，“联络人”，“争取人”以“大大地加强实力”呀，如此等等。而胡风反党集团，长期以来对党对革命文艺队伍是一贯地抱着“妥协不来”、不“泄气”、打“冲锋”、“与阵地共存亡”的死硬到底的敌对态度。
    现在还有什么话说呢？现在我们每一个真正拥护共产党、拥护革命事业的人，倒是应该弄清楚一个问题：根据上面的事实，对胡风反党集团的斗争，是否还能算是一个革命阵营内部的问题呢？这个问题现在已经很清楚地摆在我们面前了。
    今天，当国内外敌人公开地或秘密地，正在加紧对我们的社会主义革命事业进行阴谋破坏活动的时候，我们必须百倍提高警惕，彻底揭露像胡风集团这种企图从革命队伍内部、从人民内部来进行瓦解和破坏的阴谋。我们必须把对胡风反党集团的斗争和贯彻国家过渡时期总任务和反对国内外敌人的总的斗争结合起来。把这一场揭露胡风的严重的斗争，从保卫整个社会主义建设、社会主义革命事业方面分割开来、孤立起来，是会缩小这一斗争的范围，降低这一斗争的意义的，因而是不正确的。总之，我们正在进行的对胡风反党集团的斗争，是国家在社会主义道路上的一场非常严重的阶级斗争，这是关系到整个革命利益的斗争，我们必须彻底揭露和粉碎胡风集团的全部反对党反对人民反对革命的阴谋！我们必须要胡风反党集团的每一个人，交出一切秘密信件，要学舒芜那样向人民作老实的检讨，赶快向人民投降！
