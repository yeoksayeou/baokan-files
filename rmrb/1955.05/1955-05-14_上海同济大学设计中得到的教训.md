　　Lessons Learned from the Design of Shanghai Tongji University
　　Zhang Xiongfei
    Shanghai Tongji University is one of the larger higher education institutions for civil engineering and architecture in the country. However, the design of a high-rise, centralized building – the Teaching Center Building – with a floor area of more than 42,000 square meters, which the university began planning in the second half of 1953, had serious shortcomings and errors.

    Firstly, from an economic perspective: the total designed area exceeded the originally planned required area by 2,900 square meters. The central part of the building, which is eleven stories high, had to use a reinforced concrete structure and raft foundation due to its weight. The tower area is approximately 3,800 square meters, and the cost of construction alone is about 600,000 yuan. The estimated cost per square meter is 150 yuan, which is more than 40 yuan higher than the cost of the mixed structure in the wings. More steel and cement were also used. In addition, the use of unnecessary decorations such as barrel-tile roofs, flying eaves, dougong brackets, and kiss beasts, as well as the use of high-grade materials, high design standards, and unreasonable structural design, resulted in significant waste. Upon inspecting the entire building, the large roof and unnecessary decorations alone wasted approximately 560,000 yuan. If the plan were revised according to the Ministry of Higher Education's quota standards and actual teaching needs, 7,000 square meters of construction area could be saved.

    Secondly, from an applicability perspective: in order to pursue a prominent central section and the form of a tower, the external outlines of the middle eight to eleven stories were created first, and then the rooms were pieced together. Four faculty studios, two conference rooms, and one reference room occupied 1,088 square meters of building area. The faculty studios could only accommodate a dozen teachers, one conference room had eight large pillars in the middle, and another had two pillars inside. Therefore, although the two conference rooms were large, they could not function as intended. The rooms on the floors above the third floor in the middle section of the building were either irregularly shaped or had large pillars inside due to the constraints of the form. The studios and reference rooms were not coordinated and grouped together for use by a specific teaching and research group, but were rather pieced together haphazardly, resulting in considerable disarray. At the same time, due to the excessive number of entrance halls, the total traffic area of the building increased to approximately 27.2 percent of the total building area.

    The main reasons for such waste and shortcomings in the design are the erroneous tendencies of aiming too high, pursuing grandiosity, focusing on form, and being extravagant in the guiding ideology of basic construction design. This erroneous design thinking, which neglects the principles of applicability and economy while excessively emphasizing form and aesthetics, is not only reflected in the school's basic construction but also in its teaching. For example, the school lacks education on applicability and economy in guiding the architectural students' assignments, causing students to overlook the cost per square meter in their assignments. Due to the lack of clear standards in evaluating students' designs, students feel at a loss, leading to ideological confusion.

    Another reason for the waste and shortcomings in the design is the lack of serious study and implementation of the higher authorities' instructions on economy. Furthermore, although they had widely sought opinions from various parties, they did not carefully analyze, study, and adopt the opinions of others. For example, in the second half of last year, people had written to the Tianjin Dagong Daily, Shanghai Liberation Daily, and the former East China Cultural and Educational Commission, reflecting and criticizing the extravagant and wasteful phenomena in the design of the Teaching Center Building, but this did not attract the attention of the school leaders. They neither conducted serious inspections nor revised the design plan.

    In March of this year, the Ministry of Higher Education, together with the Shanghai Higher Education Bureau and Tongji University, jointly organized an inspection team to conduct a more in-depth and comprehensive inspection of the design. They initially criticized the design ideas that disregarded applicability and economy, pursued form, luxury, and extravagance, and made a relatively thorough revision of the original design. Simply changing the method of the large roof and removing the false decorations on the north and south wings (totaling more than 22,000 square meters) could save 280,000 yuan. The parts of the building that had not yet been constructed could be omitted based on the existing school building usage and future development. During the inspection period, the school leaders conducted self-examinations in connection with their own leadership thinking and design thinking, and many relevant teachers not only actively assisted in the inspection work but also expressed a desire to study in depth, launch criticism and self-criticism, establish correct design ideas, and achieve the goals of improving teaching and strengthening unity. However, for Tongji University, it is not enough to simply reduce project investment; more lessons should be learned from this.

　　上海同济大学设计中得到的教训
　　张雄飞
    上海同济大学是全国较大的高等土木建筑学校之一。但是，一九五三年下半年这个大学筹建的一座四万二千余平方公尺的高层集中式建筑物——教学中心大楼的设计，却存在着严重的缺点和错误。
    首先从经济方面看：全部设计面积超出原计划需要面积二千九百平方公尺。楼的中央部分高十一层，因为重量大，必须采用钢筋混凝土结构和箱形基础。这部分的塔楼的面积约三千八百平方公尺，土建造价即要六十万元左右。每平方公尺估算单价为一百五十元，同两翼部分混合结构的土建单价比较，要贵四十多元。使用的钢筋和水泥也较多。另外，由于采用筒瓦大屋顶、飞檐、斗拱、吻兽等不必要的装饰和使用高级材料，由于设计标准高和结构设计的不合理，也造成很大浪费。就全楼检查，仅大屋顶和不必要的装饰就要浪费约五十六万元。如根据高等教育部的定额标准和教学实际需要修改计划，可节约七千平方公尺的建筑面积。
    再从适用方面来看：为了追求中央突出和塔楼的形式，中部八层至十一层部分先作出外部轮廓线，然后再将房间拼凑进去，四间教师工作室，两间会议室和一间资料室占了一千零八十八平方公尺建筑面积，教师工作室只能容下十几位教师，一间会议室当中就有八根大柱子，另一间内也有两根柱子，因此两间会议室面积虽大，却不能发挥应有的作用。大楼中段部分三层以上各层房间，因受形式的约束，不是形状不规则，就是有粗大的柱子在内。工作室和资料室也不是配合组成，以便为某一个教研组使用，而是东拼西凑，相当凌乱。同时由于门厅过多，全楼交通面积因之增多到约占全楼总建筑面积百分之二十七点二。
      产生以上设计中的这种浪费和缺点的主要原因是，在基本建设设计的指导思想中存在着偏高偏大、追求形式、铺张浪费等错误倾向。这种忽视适用、经济原则而过分强调形式和美观的错误设计思想，不仅表现在这个学校的基本建设方面，也表现在教学方面。如学校在指导建筑系学生作业中就缺乏适用和经济的教育，致使学生在作业中忽视每平方公尺的造价问题，在评定学生的设计时，因没有明确的标准，使学生感到无所适从，以致引起了思想上的混乱。
    产生设计中浪费和缺点的另一个原因是，对上级节约的指示没有认真研究和贯彻。另外他们虽曾广泛征求了各方面的意见，但对大家的意见并没有认真分析研究和采纳。如去年下半年就曾先后有人写信给天津大公报、上海解放日报及前华东文委，反映和批评教学中心大楼设计中的铺张浪费现象，但并未引起学校领导的重视，他们既不认真检查，也不对设计方案进行修改。
    到今年三月，经过高等教育部会同上海高等教育管理局、同济大学共同组织检查组，对此设计进行了比较深入和全面的检查，初步批判了不顾适用、经济，追求形式、追求豪华和铺张浪费的设计思想，将原设计作了比较彻底的修改。南北两翼（共约二万二千余平方公尺）仅改变大屋顶做法和剔除虚假性装饰即可节省二十八万元。大楼未施工部分根据原有校舍使用情况和将来发展情况可以不再建筑。检查期间，学校领导上已结合本身领导思想和设计思想进行了检查，不少有关教师不但积极协助检查工作，并也表示要求深入学习，展开批评和自我批评，树立正确的设计思想，达到改进教学，加强团结的目的。但是，对同济大学来讲，仅仅削减工程投资还是不够的，应当从中吸取更多的教训。
