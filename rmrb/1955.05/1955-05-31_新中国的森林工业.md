　　The Forest Industry of New China
　　Zhang Ziliang, Director of the Timber Production Bureau, Ministry of Forestry
    In the past five years, the forest industry of New China has developed by leaps and bounds. From the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the banks of the Yalu River, the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, the Changbai Mountains, and the Wanda Mountains, crisscrossing and undulating... these green treasures are the base of New China's forest industry. In the south—Hainan Island has begun to manage tropical forests; in the west—the forest area in the Bailong River basin is under exploration.

    In the past few years, the forest industry sector has produced a large amount of timber, which has strongly supported the country's economic recovery and socialist construction. For example, with the timber production volume in 1950 as 100, it had increased to 493.8 by 1954. The vast majority of these timbers are high-grade and high-quality economic timbers. The allocation of timber products in 1954 was as follows: timber for capital construction (mainly industrial construction) accounted for 63 percent, timber for railway construction accounted for 17 percent, timber for the fuel industry (mainly coal mines) accounted for 12 percent, timber for postal and telecommunications and highway construction accounted for 4 percent, timber for paper making accounted for 3 percent, and the rest was for general social use. It is not difficult to see the significant role of timber production in the national economy from these distribution figures.

    In the past, the forest industry production was characterized by strong seasonality. In summer and autumn, it was hot and rainy, transportation was inconvenient, and workers had no work to do; the annual production tasks had to be completed in the short winter. This caused numerous difficulties in production. In order to change this situation, forestry workers, with the specific help of Soviet experts, launched labor competitions and invented new timber transportation tools to solve the problem of timber transportation in summer; after several years of practice, year-round operations finally appeared in many forest areas. In this way, a normal order was established in production management, a large number of temporary workers were reduced, and skilled young and middle-aged people became fixed forestry workers. Before 1953, the Jilin Forestry Industry Bureau needed to mobilize tens of thousands of farmers with their cattle and horses to go to the mountains every year to participate in the winter transportation work in the forest area; but in 1954, due to the realization of year-round operations and the increase in fixed workers, although the production volume increased compared with the past, only 1,500 farmers and 2,000 cattle and horses were mobilized, and the winter transportation task was successfully completed.

    Mechanized mass production has opened up broad prospects for changing the working conditions of forestry workers and improving production efficiency. Since 1949, the state has invested in purchasing a large number of tractors, winches, loaders, electric saws, automobiles, small locomotives, etc., so that the proportion of mechanization in forest industrial production has increased year by year, increasing from 100 in 1949 to 591.7 in 1954. Due to the use of machinery for production, the forest industry has appeared with a brand new face. The heavy labor of forestry workers and the work requiring a large number of people have been partially replaced by machinery. Production efficiency has also gradually increased: the annual output per worker in 1953 was 78.2 cubic meters, and it has increased to 96.7 cubic meters in 1954.

    With the help of Soviet experts, our forest industrial management has also been greatly improved. In particular, after the implementation of the policies of rational logging, rational timber making, and rational timber use, great results have been achieved. Only rational logging to reduce the stump height (from 70 cm to below 20 cm), the Northeast and Inner Mongolia saved the country 2 million cubic meters of timber from 1950 to 1952. The loss rate of timber rafting has been reduced from 7 percent in the past to less than 1 percent. In addition, the promotion of bark peeling of tree roots and the full utilization of treetop wood and other advanced experiences have played a great role in the rational utilization of forest resources and saving timber. In production management, a systematic production scheduling organization has been established from top to bottom; the work plan has been implemented, the planning management has been strengthened; and economic accounting has been carried out. The result of the gradual improvement of the management level is: the production cost has been reduced, the financial payment task has been completed, and a huge amount of funds has been accumulated for the country.

    With the development of production, the material and cultural lives of forestry workers have also been greatly improved. Wage income has increased year by year. The state has promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations, and the birth, old age, illness, and death of employees have been guaranteed. At present, the state-owned forest areas alone have 311 sanatoriums for tuberculosis, hot spring sanatoriums, and various sanatoriums, nursing homes, hospitals, and clinics. The occupational diseases and chronic diseases of forestry workers, especially the forest encephalitis, a unique infectious disease in the forest area, have been prevented and treated. As a result, the incidence and mortality rates have dropped sharply. According to the statistics of the Jilin Forestry Industry Bureau, in 1952, 317 people were ill and 71 people died; in 1953, 59 people were ill and 15 people died; in 1954, only 3 people were ill and deaths had been eliminated.

    In relatively concentrated forest areas, department stores, grain companies, local product companies, Xinhua bookstores, theaters, and cinemas have been established; even in extremely dispersed logging yards or workshops, commercial kiosks, bathhouses, barbershops, and laundries have been established. There are currently more than 1,100 of these welfare institutions. The housing conditions of employees have also been greatly improved. In state-owned forest areas, from 1949 to 1954, a total of more than 1.3 million square meters of employee dormitories were built. In larger forest areas, new worker villages and employee children's schools have also been built. In the practical work, the political consciousness of forest industrial workers has been rapidly improved. They have contributed tremendous strength to socialist construction with their creative labor. Many of them have become labor models and advanced producers. According to the statistics in 1954, there were a total of 5,710 people; there were 766 model groups; and there were 66 model logging yards and workshops. Many people have joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League.

    This is just the beginning. In the future, along with the development of the country's socialist industrialization, the face of the forest industry will change with each passing day.

　　新中国的森林工业
　　林业部木材生产局局长　张子良
    五年来，新中国的森林工业有了飞跃的发展。从黑龙江畔到鸭绿江边，纵横交错蜿蜒起伏的大小兴安岭群山、长白山脉、完达山脉……这些绿色的宝库，是新中国森林工业的基地。在南方——海南岛已开始经营热带林；在西方——白龙江流域的林区正在勘察中。
    几年来，森林工业部门生产了大量木材，有力地支援了祖国的经济恢复工作和社会主义建设。如以一九五○年木材生产量为一百，到一九五四年已增加为四百九十三点八。这些木材绝大部分是品等高、质量好的经济用材。一九五四年木材产品的分配情况是：基本建设（主要是工业建设）用材占百分之六十三，铁路建设用材占百分之十七，燃料工业（主要是煤矿）用材占百分之十二，邮电、公路建设用材占百分之四，造纸用材占百分之三，其他则是社会一般用材。从这些分配数字中不难看出木材生产在国民经济中的重大作用。
    过去森林工业生产的特点是季节性强。夏秋两季，天热雨多，运输不便，工人没有活做；一年的生产任务要在很短的冬季里完成。这样便造成了生产上的重重困难。为了改变这种情况，林业工人在苏联专家的具体帮助下，开展了劳动竞赛，发明创造了新式运材工具，解决了夏季运材的问题；前后经过几年的实践，终于在许多林区里出现了常年作业。这样，在生产管理上便建立了正常秩序，大量地减少了临时工人，技术熟练的青壮年们变成了固定的林业工人。吉林森林工业管理局一九五三年前每年需动员上万农民带着耕地的牛马上山，参加林区冬季运搬工作；而在一九五四年由于实现了常年作业，固定工人增多了，虽然生产数量比前增加，但只动员了一千五百名农民和二千头牛马，就顺利地完成了冬运任务。
    机械化大生产为改变林业工人的劳动条件和提高生产效率开辟了广阔的前途。从一九四九年开始，国家投资购置了大批拖拉机、绞盘机、装车机、电锯、汽车、小火车头等等，使森林工业生产机械化的比重逐年增加，以一九四九年为一百，一九五四年已增长为五百九十一点七。由于用机械进行生产，森林工业出现了崭新的面貌。林业工人的繁重劳动和用人多的工作，已有部分被机械代替。生产效率也逐步提高：一九五三年每一工人年生产量为七十八点二立方公尺，一九五四年已提高到九十六点七立方公尺。
    在苏联专家的帮助下，我们的森林工业经营管理也有很大改进。特别是贯彻了合理采伐、合理造材、合理用材的政策后，收到了很大的效果。仅合理采伐降低伐根（由七十公分降低到二十公分以下），东北和内蒙古从一九五○年到一九五二年就给国家节省了二百万立方公尺的木材。木材的流送损失率已由过去百分之七降低到百分之一以下。此外，还推广了树根剥皮、充分利用梢头木等先进经验，对合理利用森林资源和节约木材起了很大的作用。在生产管理上，从上至下建立了系统的生产调度机构；贯彻了作业计划，加强了计划管理；进行了经济核算。管理水平逐步提高的结果是：生产成本降低了，财政上缴任务完成了，为国家积累了巨量的资金。
    随着生产的发展，林业工人的物质、文化生活也有很大的改善。工资收入逐年增多。国家颁布了劳动保险条例，职工们的生、老、病、死都得到了保障。目前仅国有林区就设有肺结核疗养院、温泉疗养院和各种疗养所、养老院、医院、医务所三百一十一处。林业工人的职业病、慢性病、特别是林区特有的传染病——森林脑炎，得到了预防和治疗。因而使发病率和死亡率急骤下降。据吉林森林工业管理局的统计，一九五二年发病三百一十七人，死亡七十一人；一九五三年发病五十九人，死亡十五人；一九五四年只发病三人，死亡已杜绝了。
    在比较集中的林区里，都建立了百货公司、粮食公司、土产公司、新华书店、剧院和电影院等；即或是极为分散的伐木场或车间，也都建立了商亭、澡塘、理发所和洗衣房。这些福利机构目前已有一千一百多处。职工们的住房条件也大大改善了，在国有林区中，从一九四九年到一九五四年，共建造了一百三十多万平方公尺的职工宿舍。在较大的林区还建筑了工人新村和职工子弟学校。在实际工作的锻炼中，森林工业职工们的政治觉悟迅速提高。他们用创造性的劳动，为社会主义建设贡献出巨大的力量。他们许多人成了劳动模范和先进生产者，据一九五四年的统计，共有五千七百一十名；模范小组有七百六十六个；模范伐木场和车间有六十六个。有许多人参加了共产党和青年团。
    这只不过是开始，今后伴随着国家社会主义工业化的发展，森林工业的面貌将会日新月异地变化。
