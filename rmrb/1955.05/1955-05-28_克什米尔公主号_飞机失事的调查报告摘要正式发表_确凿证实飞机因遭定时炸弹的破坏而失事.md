Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 27th - The Indian Information Bureau issued a communique on the 27th, publishing a summary of the report by the Indonesian investigation committee responsible for investigating the "Kashmir Princess" plane crash. This report summary provides conclusive evidence that the plane crashed due to a time bomb.

The Indian Information Bureau's communique stated: The summary of the report by the Indonesian investigation committee appointed by the Indonesian government to investigate the crash of the Indian International Airlines Constellation aircraft "Kashmir Princess" on April 11, 1955, while carrying Chinese and Vietnamese representatives to the Bandung Conference, was officially published in Jakarta today. The full text of the summary is as follows:

The Indonesian investigation committee investigating the crash of the Indian International Airlines Constellation aircraft "Kashmir Princess" in the South China Sea near the Great Natuna Islands on April 11, 1955, while carrying representatives from China and Vietnam to the Bandung Conference, has submitted its report.

The committee's findings are as follows:

	(1) The aircraft was fit to fly and properly certified.
	(2) The flight crew was experienced and held valid licenses.
	(3) The aircraft had a normal payload and sufficient fuel for the flight.
	(4) The take-off from Hong Kong was normal, and the first five hours of the flight were uneventful.
	(5) The explosion occurred on board the aircraft while it was flying at an altitude of 18,000 feet above sea level. The right wing caught fire, and the fire spread rapidly, causing the hydraulic fluid and electrical equipment to fail.
	(6) The aircraft began to descend rapidly in order to make a forced landing at sea, while the flight crew effectively and calmly took emergency measures under extremely difficult circumstances.
	(7) The aircraft, with partial loss of control, touched the water with the tip of its right wing, and the fuselage broke up due to the impact.
	(8) Examination of the wreckage revealed definitive evidence that a time bomb had exploded in the right wing wheel well, with parts of the bomb still embedded in the wreckage. This explosion punctured the No. 3 fuel tank and caused a rapidly spreading fire.

Cause of the Accident

The committee concludes that the cause of the accident was an explosion caused by a time bomb placed in the right wing wheel well of the aircraft. The explosion punctured the No. 3 fuel tank, resulting in an uncontrollable fire.

The aircraft took off from Hong Kong under the command of Captain Jatar. The aircraft was fully airworthy and carried sufficient fuel for the flight. Routine telegrams were exchanged between the aircraft and ground stations, and the flight was entirely uneventful until almost five hours later, when the accident occurred while the aircraft was flying at an altitude of 18,000 feet above sea level. At this time, a muffled explosion was heard on the aircraft. Smoke began to enter the cabin through the cold air ducts, and shortly thereafter a localized fire was discovered on the right wing behind the No. 3 engine nacelle.

The aircraft immediately began to descend rapidly in order to make a forced landing at sea, and a distress signal was sent by radio. Despite fire-fighting efforts, during which the rotation of the No. 3 engine was slowed down, the fire spread very rapidly, causing the hydraulic fluid system to fail, followed by the electrical system. During the final stages of the descent, which was carried out under extremely difficult conditions, dense smoke entered the cockpit, reducing visibility to almost zero.

Only three members of the flight crew survived the accident. The aircraft was destroyed.

The work of salvaging wreckage from the sea bed began on April 25, 1955, and continued for ten days, during which nearly 90 percent of the wreckage was recovered. Examination of the wreckage revealed conclusive evidence that a fire had occurred in the part mentioned by the surviving flight crew. There was definite evidence that an explosion had occurred in the wheel well under the right wing landing gear.

Evidence

The evidence includes:

	(a) The outer shell and support members adjacent to the part were projecting outwards;
	(b) The outer shell and structural members directly opposite the explosion showed deep gouges caused by shrapnel;
	(c) The No. 3 fuel tank had an inward-facing blast hole.

The discovery of four parts of a timer, twisted, burned, and corroded, embedded in the same part where the explosion occurred, and unrelated to any equipment or structure of the aircraft, provided irrefutable evidence that a bomb had been placed in this location.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 27th - The Indonesian Ministry of Transportation issued a communique on the 27th, publishing a summary of the report by the Indonesian investigation committee responsible for investigating the "Kashmir Princess" plane crash. The communique stated: The full report is currently being studied by the Indonesian government and the Indian government.

　　“克什米尔公主号”飞机失事的调查报告摘要正式发表
　  确凿证实飞机因遭定时炸弹的破坏而失事
    新华社新德里二十七日电　印度新闻局在二十七日发表公报，公布了负责调查“克什米尔公主号”飞机失事事件的印度尼西亚调查委员会的报告摘要。这个报告摘要提供了确凿的证据，证明这架飞机是由于遭到定时炸弹的破坏而失事的。
    印度新闻局的公报说：由印度尼西亚政府任命来调查印度国际航空公司星座式飞机“克什米尔公主号”的坠毁事件的调查委员会的报告摘要，今天已在雅加达正式发表。摘要全文如下：
    调查印度国际航空公司星座式飞机“克什米尔公主号”于一九五五年四月十一日载运中国和越南前往参加万隆会议的代表时在大纳土纳群岛附近的南中国海坠毁的事件的印度尼西亚调查委员会已经提出了它的报告。
    委员会的调查结果如下：
    （一）这架飞机是适于飞行并且经过适当的证明的。
    （二）机务人员是有经验的，并且持有有效的执照。
    （三）这架飞机载运量正常，并且有充分的供飞行之用的燃料。
    （四）从香港起飞是正常的，并且头五个小时的飞行是平安无事的。
    （五）爆炸是在飞机在距海面一万八千英尺的空中飞行时在机上发生的。右翼起火，火势迅速蔓延以至使水力液体和电力设备失灵。
    （六）飞机开始迅速下降以便在海上实行强迫降落，同时机务人员在极端困难的情况下有效地和冷静地采取了紧急措施。
    （七）飞机在部分操纵失灵的情况下以右翼尖端触及水面，并且由于冲撞的缘故而机体破裂。
    （八）对残骸进行的检查显示出肯定的证据，证明右翼轮舱处爆炸了一个定时炸弹，炸弹的零件还陷在残骸内。这个爆炸打穿了第三号油箱并引起了迅速蔓延的大火。
    失事的原因
    委员会断定这次失事的原因是由于放在飞机右翼轮舱处的一个定时炸弹的爆炸所造成。爆炸打穿了第三号油箱而发生了无法控制的大火。
    飞机在贾塔尔上尉的指挥下从香港起飞。飞机是完全适于飞行的并且带有足够的供飞行之用的燃料。飞机同地面各站互相交换了例行的电报，飞行完全没有发生事故，一直到将近五小时以后，当飞机正在距海面一万八千英尺的高空飞行时才发生事故。在这个时候飞机上听到一声闷住了的爆炸声。烟就开始通过冷空气导管进入机舱，随后不久就发现了在第三号引擎机舱后面的右翼上局部着火。
    飞机立刻开始迅速下降以便使飞机在海上实行强迫降落，并且用无线电发出呼救信号。尽管进行了救火的行动，在这期间放慢了第三号引擎的转动，但火势蔓延得非常迅速，使水力液体设备失灵，随后电力设备也继之失灵。在极度困难的情况下进行的下降飞行的最后阶段内，浓烟进入驾驶舱，使得能见度减少到几乎等于零。
    只有三名机务人员在这次失事中生还。飞机毁坏了。
    从海底打捞残骸的工作于一九五五年四月二十五日开始，进行了十天，在这期间打捞到了将近百分之九十的残骸。在对残骸检查以后发现了确实的证据，证明曾在生还的机务人员所提到的那一部分起火。有肯定的迹象证明，爆炸是在右翼起落架下轮舱处发生的。
      证据
    证据有：
    （甲）贴近部分的外壳和支撑构件向外突出；
    （乙）爆炸正对面的外壳和结构构件有榴霰弹造成的深痕；
    （丙）第三号油箱有内向的炸洞。
    一个同飞机任何装备或结构毫无关系而陷在发生爆炸同一部分的已被扭曲，烧坏和侵蚀了的定时器的四个零件的发现，提供了无可辩驳的证据，证明曾在这个地方放置了一个炸弹。
    新华社雅加达二十七日电　印度尼西亚交通运输部二十七日在一项公报中发表了负责调查“克什米尔公主号”飞机失事事件的印度尼西亚调查委员会的报告摘要。公报说：报告全文目前正由印度尼西亚政府和印度政府研究中。
