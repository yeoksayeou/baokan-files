　　Shandong Province has established a total of 432 agricultural technology extension stations since February this year. Nine counties, including Junan, Guangrao, Licheng, Liaocheng, and Ningyang, have achieved a station in every district. By the end of the year, a total of 800 stations can be built, with about 53 percent of the districts in the province having stations.

      The established agricultural technology extension stations have played a significant role in this year's spring plowing and production. For example, the five agricultural technology extension stations in Heze County specifically helped the agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams in five townships to formulate production plans. They also taught new agricultural techniques, and 930 cooperative members and team members in 26 townships have learned new agricultural techniques. With the help of the agricultural technology extension station in Dianzi Township, Ju County, the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative changed the land from two crops in three years to two crops in one year, increased the planting of high-yield crops, and expanded paddy fields by utilizing old wells and digging new wells. It is estimated that the annual grain output can be increased by 50,000 jin.

　　山东普遍建立农业技术推广站
    山东省从今年二月以来，共已建立了四百三十二处农业技术推广站，莒南、广饶、历城、聊城、宁阳等九个县已达到区区有站。到年底，共可建站八百处，全省约有百分之五十三的区有站。
      已经建起的农业技术推广站，在今年春耕生产中起了很大的作用。如菏泽县五个农业技术推广站具体帮助五个乡的农业合作社、互助组订了生产计划，还通过技术传授的方法，已有二十六个乡的九百三十个社、组员学会了新的农业技术。莒县店子乡红星农业合作社在该区农业技术推广站的帮助下，将二年三作的地改成一年二作，增种高产作物，利用旧井、打新井扩大水田等，约计全年可增产粮食五万斤。
