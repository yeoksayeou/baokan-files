Why Basic Construction Plans Were Not Completed
　　Chen Feng

　　Among state-owned basic construction enterprises in Liaoning Province, only the Benxi Iron and Steel Company and the Fuxin Power Plant exceeded their targets for the first quarter of this year. All other units failed to meet their goals. By the end of March, state-owned enterprises in Liaoning Province had completed only 74.6 percent of the first quarter's investment plan, accounting for 12.4 percent of the annual plan. Key projects completed only 77 percent of the first quarter's plan, accounting for 14.5 percent of the annual plan. In the geological sector, only the Anshan Geological Exploration Company completed its plan. Exploration teams in the Liaoning area under the Northeast Coalfield First Geological Bureau and the Shenyang Geological Exploration Company of the Nonferrous Metals Administration did not complete their plans. A large number of design units also failed to meet their targets.

　　The plan completion rate for April was also poor. The Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company completed only 72.4 percent of its monthly plan in April. The Benxi Iron and Steel Company completed only 71.7 percent of its monthly plan. The Fuxin Mining Bureau completed only 91.7 percent of its plan.

　　Not only were the plans poorly executed, but the number of quality and safety accidents also increased significantly compared to the same period last year. The Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company alone experienced 607 quality incidents in the first quarter, more than three times the number in the same period last year. Of these, 142 were serious quality incidents and 347 required rework. Furthermore, some accidents were major incidents that had not occurred in the past few years. For example, 14 of the 22 column foundations in the Anshan Iron and Steel Primary Rolling Mill's factory building had cracks, the largest of which was 20 millimeters wide, and eight had subsided. Construction of the boiler room project at the Metal Structure Factory was forced to halt due to six broken beams and subsidence of the factory building. The coal storage plant gantry crane foundation project had 70 large and small cavities, the largest of which was 1.3 meters deep. The cross-line project, in pursuit of speed, was carried out without proper waterproofing measures, resulting in complete rework. Half of the Liushan Inclined Shaft project at the Fushun Mining Bureau needed to be reworked. Safety accidents also occurred frequently. According to statistics from the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company, the number of safety accidents in the first quarter of this year more than doubled compared to the same period last year, and increased month by month.

　　The reasons for the poor completion of plans and the occurrence of serious quality and safety accidents, in addition to objective factors such as unrealistic plans in some units and a heavy workload in the first quarter, are mainly due to:

　　1. Some units' leading cadres lack sufficient awareness of the arduousness and importance of this year's basic construction tasks, and are blindly optimistic, leading to relaxation and a failure to properly prepare for construction. For example, the Fushun Thermal Power Company's water tower project was scheduled to begin on February 15th, but in mid-February it was discovered that the design budget was missing 30 items, sand had not been ordered, cement grades and mechanized construction methods had not been determined, and all the timber had not arrived, forcing the project to be postponed.

　　2. Some units' leading cadres have serious departmentalism and decentralism, and there is a lack of active cooperation and coordination among the relevant departments during construction. Each department prioritizes its own convenience, shifting responsibility when problems arise, and even creating deadlocks that affect construction. Lack of coordinated cooperation within the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company accounted for 42 percent of the non-completion of project plans. The fifth team of the Anshan Metal Structure Installation Engineering Company, without any justification, delayed the installation of more than 70 rivets on a crane, delaying the entire project by nearly three months and disrupting the construction plans of the second team of the Mechanical Installation Company, the Electrical Installation Company, and the Crane Team several times, resulting in idle labor. When compiling plans, the Dalian Chemical Plant did not communicate with each other, resulting in the ridiculous situation where only 36 percent of the plan was completed according to the client (contracting unit), while 114 percent was completed according to the contractor. A project at the Lushun Second Power Plant was delayed by one month due to a dispute over 100 yuan in engineering fees. A 300-horsepower winch transferred from the Fushun Open-pit Mine for the Liushan Inclined Shaft project was supposed to be installed in March, but due to the open-pit mine dismantling the winch's bearings and gears, it had not been installed by April.

　　These erroneous thoughts and behaviors have already caused great losses to the national construction cause and should be corrected immediately.

### 为什么没有完成基本建设计划

　　为什么没有完成基本建设计划
　　陈风
    辽宁省境内的国营基本建设各企业单位，今年第一季度计划除本溪钢铁公司和阜新发电厂两个单位超额完成外，其他单位都没有完成。截至三月底止，辽宁省内各国营企业只完成第一季度投资计划的百分之七十四点六，占全年计划的百分之十二点四，其中重点工程只完成第一季度计划的百分之七十七，占全年计划的百分之十四点五。地质部门除鞍山地质勘探公司完成计划外，东北煤田第一地质局和有色金属管理局沈阳地质勘探公司在辽宁地区的勘探队都没有完成计划。设计部门也有大部分单位没有完成计划。
    四月份计划完成的也很不好。鞍山钢铁建设公司四月份仅完成月计划的百分之七十二点四。本溪钢铁公司只完成月计划的百分之七十一点七。阜新矿务局只完成计划的百分之九十一点七。
    这些单位不仅计划完成得不好，质量事故和安全事故比去年同时期也增加很多。仅鞍山钢铁建设公司第一季度就发生了质量事故六百零七次，比去年同时期增加了三倍多，其中严重的质量事故一百四十二次，返工事故三百四十七次，而且，有的事故是过去几年来没有过的重大事故。如鞍钢初轧厂厂房二十二根柱基有十四根有裂纹，最大的裂纹有二十公厘，并有八根下沉。金属结构厂锅炉房工程，因发生六根断梁和厂房下沉的事故而被迫停工。贮煤厂龙门吊基础工程，有大小狗洞七十个，最大的深达一公尺三。跨线工程为追求进度，未作好防水措施即冒然施工，结果全部返工。抚顺矿务局刘山斜井工程有一半需要返工。安全事故也不断发生，据鞍山钢铁建设公司统计，今年第一季度安全事故比去年同时期增加两倍多，而且在第一季度是逐月增加的。
    计划完成得不好和造成严重的质量事故、安全事故的原因，除有的单位计划不切合实际，第一季度工作较多等客观原因外，主要是由于：
    一、有些单位的领导干部对今年基本建设任务的艰巨性和重要性认识不足，盲目乐观，因而松懈下来，没有做好施工前的准备工作。如抚顺火电公司水塔工程计划二月十五日开工，到二月中旬才发现设计预算漏了三十项，沙子没有订货，水泥标号、机械化施工方法没有确定，木材全部未到，只得延期施工。
    二、有些单位的领导干部存在着严重的本位主义和分散主义思想，各有关部门之间在施工中缺乏积极主动互相配合协作的精神，各顾各的方便，发生问题就互相扯皮，互相推诿，各持己见，甚至闹成僵局，影响施工。鞍山钢铁建设公司没有按照项目完成计划，其中有百分之四十二是由于内部施工中的配合协作不协调所致。鞍山金属结构安装工程公司第五队，毫无理由地拖延了一架吊车上的七十多个铆钉的安装工程，就影响整个工期拖延了近三个月，数次打乱了机械安装公司第二队、电气安装公司和吊车队的施工计划，造成窝工。大连化学厂编制计划时，互不联系，结果出现了按甲方（发包单位）计划只完成百分之三十六，而按乙方（承包单位）计划却完成了百分之一百一十四的笑话。旅大第二发电厂的一项工程，为一百元工程费争执不下，使开工时间延长一个月。刘山斜井工程从抚顺露天矿调拨来的三百马力绞车，应在三月份安装完，由于绞车的轴瓦、牙轮被露天矿拆走，直到四月份还没安装。
    这些错误的思想行为，已经给国家建设事业造成了很大的损失，应该立即纠正。
