Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, May 25th (TASS dispatch) – Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali and Foreign Minister Azem issued a statement in Damascus saying: "We emphasize that Syria is determined to continue negotiations on the conclusion of a defense pact between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria." The statement emphasized that Syria "will not abandon this policy" because "Syria's policy of striving for Arab unity is the policy for Arab countries to achieve their national goals."

The joint statement by the Syrian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister was issued in response to a statement by former Iraqi Prime Minister Doufik al-Suwaidi. Suwaidi, in a conversation with a reporter from the Beirut "Al-Khabar" newspaper, insisted that after his talks and contacts with Syrian leaders in Damascus recently, he had the impression that Syria "will not participate in the Arab tripartite alliance."

　　叙总理和外长重申将参加阿拉伯合作组织
    新华社二十六日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特二十五日讯：叙利亚总理阿萨利和外交部长阿泽姆在大马士革发表声明说：“我们着重指出，叙利亚坚决继续进行关于埃及、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚三国之间订立防御公约的谈判。”声明强调说，叙利亚“将不放弃这一政策”，因为“叙利亚奉行的争取阿拉伯团结的政策是阿拉伯各国达到民族目的的政策”。
    叙利亚总理和外交部长的这一联合声明是为了答复伊拉克前首相杜斐克·苏威迪的谈话而发表的。苏威迪在同贝鲁特“新闻报”记者谈话时硬说，不久前他在大马士革同叙利亚领导者谈话和接触后得出一种印象，似乎叙利亚“将不参加阿拉伯的三国联盟”。
