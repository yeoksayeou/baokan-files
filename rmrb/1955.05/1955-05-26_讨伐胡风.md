Denouncing Hu Feng
　　Kang Zhuo
　　We have already read Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" and Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique," and now we have read the second batch of "Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" exposed by the "People's Daily." These all came from Hu Feng's own pen. Hu Feng and Hu Feng's pen exist in two different worlds: one above ground, one underground; one open, one hidden—both before and after national liberation. I ask: besides counter-revolutionary professional secret agents, who else lives like Hu Feng! From the secret letters written by the hidden, real Hu Feng, we see how strong and blood-soaked this conspirator's counter-revolutionary partisanship is!

　　This is Hu Feng's so-called "artistic conscience," so-called "humanitarianism"! Hu Feng dared to steal Party documents and was so arrogant as to plot to inquire about information from Premier Zhou. Isn't this a complete secret agent? Hu Feng's revolutionary tactics such as "Sun Wukong drilling into the belly," "first becoming the master," "a whip wrapped in rubber to beat prisoners," "seizing the banner," "setting up suspicious formations," "probing the direction," conducting "excavation warfare," and going to which area to start work and "fighting while rolling," "willing to cut off my head and throw it out," "coexisting with the position," aren't these exactly the tactics of Trotsky and Bukharin described in the "History of the CPSU (B.)"? Hu Feng frantically slandered the brilliant works of our great people's leader Comrade Mao Zedong as "totems," slandered our Party's wise and correct literary and artistic policy as "mechanical rule," and used terms such as "petty bourgeoisie," "bureaucrats," and "dirty and smelly iron walls" to curse the revolution, which are simply terms peddled everywhere by Trotskyite elements. Hu Feng's way of life of having to "wrap insults in smiles" and "shake hands and make peace" with revolutionaries, and even being "unable to help but be wary" of the correspondents sent by the Writers Association to serve him, is exactly the same as the daily life image of the two Trotskyite elements depicted in the Soviet film "The Great Citizen" who murdered the revolutionary leader Shakhov (i.e., Kirov). Hu Feng's words and deeds of "commemorating the dead" are the same trick as Zinoviev's act of assassinating Kirov on one hand and writing articles praising Kirov on the other. Hu Feng's feigning death when defeated, and his retreat tactics of arranging false self-criticisms everywhere and contracting for himself without involving other accomplices, are like the Trotskyites submitting statements to the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party in those years, wanting to temporarily build a trench for the "revolutionary petty bourgeoisie" in order to "seek rebirth in suffering" and "probe the direction" for a comeback. As for the Hu Feng anti-Party clique's open "perfunctoriness," "compliance," and "absolute political guarantee," and the secretly and carefully arranged attacks, provocations, expansion of the organization, turning the Party's organization into an anti-Party organization, and the vicious method of preserving the New Literature Publishing House, etc., these counter-revolutionary activities are no different from the activities of a complete secret agent organization. Look! Hu Feng is inheriting and developing all the legacies and creations of secret agents, Trotskyites, and all counter-revolutionary elements in this way, launching a daring and outrageous conspiracy in the revolutionary ranks that kills without shedding blood, ranging from opposing Chairman Mao to opposing every revolutionary person.

　　Of course, we also see an open, fake Hu Feng. But isn't this open Hu Feng also constantly opposing the revolution in a very obscure and clever way? In our country's transitional period of striving for socialism, he put forward a whole set of anti-socialist programs to challenge the Party Central Committee and the people of the whole country; isn't this cooperating with the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in fighting for the world? While gnashing his teeth in secret to overthrow "mechanical rule," isn't he also openly trying every possible method to oppose materialism and oppose the Party's and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy? As early as before the War of Resistance Against Japan, when he had just sneaked into the League of Left-Wing Writers, that is, when he had just sneaked into the revolutionary camp, Hu Feng used the distortion of the facts of the liquidation of the "RAPP" in the Soviet literary and artistic circles at that time as a weapon to vigorously attack materialism, oppose the progressive writers' acquisition of a revolutionary worldview, and indulge in mocking the Party's leadership of the literary and artistic cause. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Hu Feng, with the help of the Party and the people, founded "July," and continued to promote his idealistic clichés that revolutionary writers should not have a healthy outlook on life. When the Party Central Committee put forward the opposition to subjectivism, Hu Feng vigorously promoted and praised the subjective "On the Subjective" in the "Hope" magazine, which was run with the help of the Party and the people, and promoted Nietzsche's philosophy of "man as animal," which had been regarded as a treasure by Hitler; and he also called revolutionary literature "police literature," and called the revolutionary literary and artistic movement the same as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's "adverse current." Chairman Mao published "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," pointing out to the national literary and artistic circles the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the writers from intellectual backgrounds must go deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers to transform their thinking. Hu Feng followed closely in Chongqing, saying that the masses of the people were full of spiritual enslavement wounds, while intellectual writers were Marxists who were importing revolutionary ideas to the people among the people; therefore, writers did not need to transform their thinking at all, but only needed to strengthen their subjective fighting spirit to criticize the people's "wounds"—Hu Feng opposed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy in this way, competing with the Communist Party for intellectuals and the masses of the people, and achieving close cooperation with the anti-communist and anti-people US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. When China's Third Revolutionary Civil War entered its climax in 1948, Hu Feng even more frantically attacked the Party's writers who criticized him in Shanghai and published "On the Road of Realism," further developing his theory of "spiritual enslavement wounds"!

　　Hu Feng's every hidden and open activity is anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary; we must completely, thoroughly, and entirely smash the Hu Feng anti-Party clique headed by Hu Feng and its conspiracy!

### 讨伐胡风

专栏：

　　讨伐胡风
　　康濯
    我们已经看过了胡风的“我的自我批判”和舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”，现在我们又看了“人民日报”揭发的“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”。这些都出自胡风一人的手笔。胡风和胡风的笔处在两个不同的世界：一个是地上，一个是地下；一个是公开，一个是暗藏——不论全国解放以前或解放以后都是这样。试问：像胡风这样生活着的，除了反革命的职业特务，还有什么人！我们从暗藏的真的胡风所写的密信，看到这个阴谋家的反革命的党派性，又是多么的强烈，多么的鲜血淋漓！
    这就是胡风的所谓“艺术良心”，所谓“人道主义”！胡风竟胆敢偷窃党内文件和狂妄到阴谋布置从周总理那里探听情况，这难道不是十足的特务分子？胡风的“孙行者钻进肚皮去”“先变成老爷”“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”“把大旗抓到手里”“布得成疑阵”“窥测方向”搞“挖心战”以及到哪一地区开辟工作和“且打滚且作战”“愿意割下我的头颅抛掷出去”“与阵地共存亡”等等对付革命的战法，难道不正是“联共（布）党史”里叙述过的托洛茨基和布哈林分子的战法？胡风疯狂地诬蔑我们伟大的人民领袖毛泽东同志的天才著作为“图腾”，诬蔑我们党的英明正确的文艺方针为“机械论的统治”，以及痛骂革命所用的“市侩”“官僚”“脏臭的铁壁”等等用语，简直就是托匪分子到处贩运的用语。胡风不得不“用微笑包着侮蔑”和革命者“握手言欢”以及对作家协会派去侍候他的通讯员都“不能不存戒心”的生活方式，和苏联影片“伟大的公民”所描写的谋杀革命领袖沙霍夫（即基洛夫）的两个托匪分子日常生活的形象也完全一样。胡风“纪念死人”的言行，是和季诺维也夫一面暗杀了基洛夫，一面又写文章颂扬基洛夫相同的手腕。而胡风战败时候的装死和到处布置假检讨以及自己承包而不牵连其它党羽等等退却策略，有如当年托洛茨基分子向苏联共产党中央递交申明书，想要暂时筑起一道“革命小资产阶级”的堑壕，以便“在忍受中求得重生”与“窥测方向”而卷土重来。至于胡风反党集团的公开“敷衍”“顺着”和“政治上我绝对保证”，暗里严密布置的进攻、挑拨、扩大组织、把党的组织变成反党组织与保存新文艺出版社的恶毒办法等等反革命活动，更和一个完整的特务组织的活动毫无区别；请看啊！胡风就是这样承袭着并且发展着特务分子、托洛茨基分子和一切反革命分子的全部遗产和创造，杀人不见血地在革命队伍里施展其从反对毛主席一直到反对每一个革命人民的胆大包天的阴谋。
    当然，我们还看到一个公开的假的胡风。但就是这个公开的胡风，不也一直是用十分隐晦而巧妙的方式反对革命的么？在我国正为社会主义事业而奋斗的过渡时期，提出一整套反社会主义的纲领，向党中央和全国人民挑战；这还不是配合美蒋匪帮在打天下？暗里咬牙切齿地要推翻“机械论的统治”，公开不也是想尽各种方法反对唯物主义，反对党和毛主席的文艺方针？远在抗日战争以前，在刚刚钻进左翼作家联盟、也就是刚刚钻进革命阵营的时候，胡风就以歪曲当时苏联文艺界清算“拉普”的事实作为武器，大事攻击唯物主义，反对进步作家应当取得革命的世界观，尽情地嘲骂党对文艺事业的领导。抗日战争初期，胡风在党和人民的帮助下创办“七月”，仍然继续宣传他的革命作家不要健康人生观等等唯心主义的滥调。待到党中央提出反对主观主义，胡风就在党和人民帮他办起来的“希望”杂志上极力宣传歌颂主观的“论主观”，宣传曾被希特勒奉为至宝的尼采的“人而动物”的哲学；并且把革命的文学也称为“警察文学”，把革命文艺运动叫作和蒋介石匪帮一样的“逆流”。毛主席发表“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，向全国文艺界指出了文艺为工农兵服务和知识分子出身的作家必须深入工农兵改造思想的方向。胡风紧跟着就在重庆说人民大众满身都是精神奴役的创伤，知识分子作家却都是在人民当中向人民输入革命思想的马克思主义者；因此作家根本不要改造思想，只要加强主观战斗精神，去批判人民的“创伤”——胡风就是这样反对毛主席的文艺方针，跟共产党争夺知识分子和争夺人民群众，而跟反共反人民的美蒋匪帮达到了紧密的配合。当我国第三次国内革命战争进入高涨的一九四八年，胡风更在上海猖狂攻击批评他的党的作家，出版“论现实主义的路”，进一步发展他的“精神奴役的创伤”的理论！
    胡风的一切隐蔽的和公开的活动，都是反党反人民反革命的；我们一定要干净、彻底、全部粉碎以胡风为首脑的胡风反党集团及其阴谋！
