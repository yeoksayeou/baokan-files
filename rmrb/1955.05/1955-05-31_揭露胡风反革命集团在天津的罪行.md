　　Exposing the Crimes of the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique in Tianjin
　　Fang Ji
　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we have exposed the true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. This is a major victory on the literary and artistic front and the ideological front, a major victory for the revolutionary cause. We should cheer for such a victory!
　　The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's conspiracy activities have created great evils in Tianjin's literary and artistic circles and among young intellectuals. In 1950, they began a planned offensive against Tianjin. They believed that Tianjin had no so-called literary scene in the past, that it was a blank slate, and therefore easy to occupy; furthermore, after liberation, Lu Li and Lu Dian, who had long been closely connected with the Hu Feng clique, were "in charge" of "Tianjin's literary affairs," so they sent one of their main generals, A Long (i.e., Chen Yimen), to Tianjin to engage in "development work." For more than five years, as Hu Feng had hoped, they had achieved some of their goals. For a time, under the "management of Lu Li and others," "Tianjin's literary affairs were very lively," and "burning." But what he called the "future" was not "very promising." After A Long's "On Tendency" was criticized in 1950, it began to arouse people's vigilance; during the rectification campaign for cadres in 1951, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered that some people in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles had serious ideological problems; during the rectification of literature and art in 1952, the literary and art circles of Tianjin also struggled against A Long's erroneous works and erroneous ideas; during the reorganization of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles in 1953, the mistakes of some of them were seriously dealt with; since the national criticism of Hu Feng's ideology began at the end of 1954, the literary and art circles of Tianjin, under the leadership of the Party, have launched a resolute struggle against them.
　　However, due to the past lack of clear understanding of their counter-revolutionary nature, although struggles have been carried out, they have not been forceful enough. Therefore, they still established counter-revolutionary underground fortresses in Tianjin and carried out various counter-revolutionary activities. Led by A Long, and together with Lu Li and Lu Dian, they formed the core of a Tianjin Hu Feng clique, actively spreading the influence of Hu Feng's reactionary ideology ideologically and organizationally, and carrying out activities to "win people over" and "contact people." A Long usurped important positions such as member of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, editor of the organ journal of the Writers Association, lecturer at Nankai University, and teacher at the Art School, and disseminated Hu Feng's reactionary ideology in large quantities and systematically. In the organ journal of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, almost every issue contained articles by him under various pseudonyms; in Tianjin, he wrote nearly a million words of reactionary works such as "Poetry and Reality," "What is Poetry," and "The Writer's Character and the Creation of Characters." In addition, A Long also specifically collected what he called "shortcomings" in our real life, arbitrarily distorting the Party's policies, responsible persons' reports, and articles. He recorded these, concentrated them, and titled them "A Collection of Marvels," as material for him to write anti-Party articles and fabricate anti-Party remarks. Many of these materials have appeared in his published works. For example, the book "What is Poetry" made extensive use of such materials as the "basis" for him to carry out reactionary propaganda.
　　Not only that, but A Long's theoretical activities were planned and targeted. For example, his advocacy of "life is everywhere" and "art is politics" was, at the time, aimed at the call of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China for writers to go deep into the lives of workers and reflect industrial construction; his "On Tendency" was issued to oppose the works of the liberated areas and weaken the influence of revolutionary literary and artistic works. More importantly, A Long actually managed to openly usurp the name of the Party organization to carry out anti-Party activities. According to recent disclosures, during the rectification of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles in 1951, the Minister of Propaganda of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China criticized their mistakes in the summary, and the Party branch of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles wrote a report to oppose it; this report was drafted by Lu Dian and revised by A Long. Today, it seems that the content of this report is actually a complete program, a direct challenge by Tianjin's Hu Feng elements to the Party's literary and artistic work policy and the Party's leadership! This one example alone can illustrate how rampant the Hu Feng clique's activities in Tianjin were!
　　Another important backbone member of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique in Tianjin was Lu Dian, a "spy" sent by Hu Feng into the revolutionary ranks. He used his status as a Communist Party member to steal a large amount of Party secrets and Party documents, becoming an important intelligence officer for the Hu Feng clique to probe into Party information. In Hu Feng's letter, Lu Li was "praised" and "hoped for," and he was regarded as the public agent of the Hu Feng clique in Tianjin, which was also very reasonable. Examining Lu Li's poems, one can see that the ideas expressed in many of his works are completely consistent with Hu Feng's anti-Party program. He faithfully publicized and practiced Hu Feng's "theories" in his own works, which made him one of the important figures in the Hu Feng clique.
　　In addition, A Long and others also recruited and cultivated a group of large and small henchmen in Tianjin as tools for them to oppose the revolution. Now, we warn these people that you should express genuine repentance with practical actions, stand up and expose the counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng clique, strive for the forgiveness of the people, and start anew.
　　The exposed materials of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique have angered the people of the whole country and the people of Tianjin. They put on the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, adopted double-dealing tactics, mixed in the revolutionary literary and artistic ranks, and deceived the people for more than 20 years. In Tianjin, they carried out conspiracy activities for more than five years, established underground fortresses, and妄想夺取 (wan xiang duo qu - vainly attempted to seize) Tianjin's revolutionary literary and artistic positions as a stronghold for them to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. However, under the leadership of the Party, we are fully confident and have the certainty to, together with the people of the entire city of Tianjin, tear down Hu Feng's bunkers in Tianjin, completely defeat the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, and eliminate all their reactionary influences!

　　揭露胡风反革命集团在天津的罪行
　　方纪
    在中国共产党领导下，我们揭露了胡风反革命集团的真面目。这是文艺战线上、思想战线上的一大胜利，是革命事业的一大胜利，我们应为这样的胜利欢呼！
    胡风反革命集团的阴谋活动，在天津文艺界和青年知识分子中造下了极大的罪恶。一九五○年，他们就开始对天津实行有计划的进攻。他们认为天津过去没有所谓文坛，是一片空白，因此容易占领；加以解放以后，就有老早与胡风集团有密切联系的鲁藜、芦甸在“主持”“天津文运”，因此派遣了他的主将之一阿垅（即陈亦门）到天津来从事
  “开辟工作”。五年多以来，正如胡风所希望的，曾经达到了他们部分的目的。有一个时期，在“鲁藜等主持”下，“天津文运很活泼”，是“烧起来了”的。但他所说的“前途”，却并不“很有”。一九五○年，阿垅的“论倾向性”受批评以后，便开始引起了人们的警惕；一九五一年干部整风时，中共天津市委便发觉了文联有些人的思想问题很严重；一九五二年文艺整风时，天津的文艺界又对阿垅的错误作品和错误思想进行了斗争；一九五三年改组文联时，又对他们之中有些人的错误进行了严肃的处理；一九五四年底全国开展胡风思想批判以后到现在，天津文艺界在党的领导下向他们展开了坚决的斗争。
    但是，由于过去对他们的反革命面目认识不清，虽然进行了斗争却还不够有力。因此他们仍然在天津建立了反革命的地下堡垒，进行了各种反革命的活动。以阿垅为首，和鲁藜、芦甸一起，形成了一个天津胡风集团的核心，从思想上和组织上，积极传播胡风反动思想的影响，进行“争取人”、“联络人”的活动。阿垅窃据了文联委员，文协机关刊物编辑，南开大学讲师，艺术学校教员等重要职位，大量地和系统地传播了胡风反动思想。在文联机关刊物上，几乎每期有他各种不同化名的文章；在天津写成了他的“诗与现实”、“诗是什么”、“作家的性格和人物的创造”等近百万字的反动著作。此外，阿垅还专门搜集了我们现实生活中他所谓的
  “缺点”，任意曲解党的政策、负责人的报告和文章。把这些记录下来，集中起来，题名为“绝妙集”，作为他写作反党文章，和制造反党言论的材料。这些材料，有不少已见于他出版的著作中。例如“诗是什么”一书中，便大量利用了这类材料，来做为他进行反动宣传的“根据”。
    不但如此，阿垅的理论活动都是有计划、有目标的。例如他提倡“到处是生活”，“艺术即政治”，在当时，就是针对着中共天津市委号召作家深入工人生活，反映工业建设而发的；他的“论倾向性”，是为反对解放区的作品，削弱革命文艺作品的影响而发的。更重要的是，阿垅居然达到了公开盗用党组织的名义进行反党的活动。根据最近的揭发，一九五一年文联整风时，当时中共天津市委宣传部长在总结中批评了他们的错误，文联党支部写报告加以反对；这报告，便是由芦甸起草，经阿垅修改过的。今天看来，这报告的内容，竟是一份完整的纲领，是天津的胡风分子对党的文艺工作方针和党的领导的直接挑战！只这一个例子，就可以说明胡风集团在天津的活动猖狂到什么地步！
    在天津的胡风反党集团中间的另一个重要骨干分子是芦甸，是胡风派到革命队伍中来的“坐探”。他利用共产党员的身份，大量地窃取了党内机密和党内文件，成为胡风集团刺探党内消息的重要情报员。胡风的信中，对鲁藜加以“表扬”，抱有“希望”，把他当作胡风集团在天津的公开代理人，也是大有道理的。检查一下鲁藜的诗，人们就可以看到，在他的许多作品中所表现的思想，是与胡风的反党纲领全然一致的。他忠实地在自己的作品中宣传了和实践了胡风的“理论”，这使他成为胡风集团中的重要人物之一。
    此外，阿垅等还在天津拉拢和培植了一批大小爪牙，作为他们进行反对革命的工具。现在，我们警告这些人，你们应该用实际行动来表示真正的悔改，站出来揭露胡风集团的反革命活动，争取人民的宽恕，重新做人。
    被揭发的胡风反党集团的材料，激怒了全国人民，激怒了天津市人民。他们披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，采取两面派手段，混在革命的文艺队伍中，欺骗人民达二十多年之久。在天津，他们进行了五年多的阴谋活动，建立了地下堡垒，妄想夺取天津的革命文艺阵地，作为他们进行反革命活动的据点。但是，在党的领导下，我们完全有信心，有把握和全天津市的人民一起，掀掉胡风在天津的地堡，彻底打垮胡风反党集团，并且肃清他们的一切反动影响！
