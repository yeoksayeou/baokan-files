Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Recently, various regions have reported that the situation of unified grain purchase and supply in rural areas is tense, and there are also many problems in urban grain purchase and supply. Today, a Xinhua News Agency reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Ministry of Food of the People's Republic of China regarding these issues, and he made the following statement:

The person in charge of the Ministry of Food first explained that the current tense situation of unified grain purchase and supply in many rural areas, from a national perspective, is not due to excessive unified purchase of grain last year, nor is it due to insufficient unified sale of grain to rural areas this year. He emphasized that the main reason is that the unified sales work in rural areas has not been done conscientiously. First, from the perspective of the amount of unified purchase, the total grain output in 1954 increased compared to the previous year, and the state's plan to collect and purchase grain from farmers did not increase compared to the previous year. However, due to the rare large floods in several provinces last year, the state appropriately purchased more grain in non-disaster areas in order to support the people in disaster areas to overcome the famine and compensate for the reduction in levies and purchases and the need for more sales in disaster areas. Only some farmers in these areas felt that the amount of purchase was more than the previous year. Secondly, from the perspective of the amount of unified sales, the national grain sales target for the grain year from July 1954 to June 1955 increased by approximately 10 billion catties compared to the previous year. This year, in order to ensure the grain supply to urban and rural people, the state not only did not increase inventories in many provinces but also used part of the state's original inventory of revolving grain. From this, it can be seen that the state has made its best efforts to guarantee the supply to urban and rural people. Especially for the people in disaster areas, the state vigorously transferred grain on a national scale to provide timely supply, which not only ensured the food needs of the people in disaster areas but also ensured the supply of seeds, so that the lives of the people in disaster areas were guaranteed and production was rapidly restored. At the same time, under such a large disaster last year, the price of grain was kept stable, which was conducive to the stability of the entire market and also conducive to the smooth progress of the country's socialist construction.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Food continued to point out: Some people may think that the tense situation of grain in rural areas in our country is related to grain exports. In fact, the amount of grain exported by the state each year is based on needs and possibilities, and is planned and controlled. The amount is not large, accounting for only about 4% of the total domestic urban and rural sales, which should have no impact on the domestic market supply, and this is also necessary for the country to achieve socialist industrialization.

Regarding the main problems existing in the current unified grain purchase and supply in urban and rural areas and the future improvement methods, the person in charge of the Ministry of Food emphasized: The current situation of unified grain purchase and supply in rural areas is that the unified purchase work and the unified sales work in many areas last winter and this spring were not well combined. The grassroots cadres were not clear about the situation and their control was too loose, resulting in a wide supply area and a large amount. For example, in March this year, the sales volume of some provinces was equivalent to supplying two-thirds of the population of the province, and some counties were equivalent to supplying the entire population. This shows that both the supply area and the supply volume have obviously exceeded the actual needs of the grain-deficient people, and part of them must be false, which is extremely abnormal. At present, although there are still cases where the grain supply work in rural areas has not supplied or insufficiently supplied those who should be supplied, more often, those who should not be supplied are supplied, or those who should be supplied less are supplied more. According to the situation of unified sales make-up lessons in various places during this period, the seriousness of the problem lies not in the fact that a small number of truly grain-deficient farmers do not get a reasonable supply and have opinions, which should and must be resolved; the seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that many farmers who are not grain-deficient or even have surplus grain have abnormal psychological tension, and are also blindly shouting "grain shortage," and even taking the lead in shouting for supply, making it difficult to distinguish between true and false. Many of our grassroots cadres do not analyze the situation, but blindly follow the shouting, and let the unified sales work take its own course. Some areas even have a small number of grassroots cadres who practice favoritism and fraud, coupled with the opportunity for illegal landlords, rich peasants, and lurking counter-revolutionaries to provoke and sabotage, resulting in man-made tension. This is the basic reason for the current tense grain supply in many rural areas. The experience of unified sales work in many rural areas proves that as long as the cadres' thinking is corrected, so that they have a correct understanding of the unified purchase and supply work, deeply mobilize the masses, carry out sufficient political work and mass work, publicize the unified sales indicators to the masses, and after full deliberation and repeated discussions, conduct evaluations house by house, the truly grain-deficient households can get a reasonable supply, and the parts that should not be supplied and can be supplied less can be reduced. For example, in the 56 townships in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, where the unified sales make-up work has been completed, the supply volume originally requested by the masses has been generally reduced, generally dropping by 30%, and individually dropping to 70%.

Now our task is to vigorously rectify the unified sales work in rural areas in accordance with the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on stepping up the rectification of grain unified sales work.

As for the current grain supply work in cities, the person in charge of the Ministry of Food pointed out: In the past, sales were too loose. This is first manifested in the fact that the phenomenon of wasting grain in institutions, troops, enterprises, schools, and organizations is quite common and serious. Farmers are dissatisfied with this phenomenon. A small number of institutions and enterprises even violate the state's grain policy and sell the extra grain they receive to private merchants, vendors, or nearby farmers at high prices for profit. This is intolerable behavior and must be treated seriously and checked and dealt with seriously. Secondly, the management of grain for general industries, residents' rations, and the supply of mobile population is too loose. The so-called method of assigning areas and fixed points for grain purchase based on certificates has completely become an irresponsible self-flow state in many cities, resulting in the widespread phenomenon of purchasing and transporting grain outside the area. Since September last year, for more than half a year, the supply volume in cities has been increasing continuously, exceeding the state's planned targets. This abnormal situation must also be reversed in a timely manner. In the past month or so, major and medium-sized cities across the country have successively launched grain saving campaigns, conducting a relatively profound education on grain saving for the vast number of workers and residents, and improving everyone's understanding of grain saving, and creating many ways to save grain. Therefore, this grain saving campaign has achieved certain results both politically and economically, and it is still necessary to continue to adhere to it in the future. However, due to the lack of comprehensive and effective measures for supply management, the sales volume of grain in cities has not decreased, but some cities are still increasing. In order to further strengthen and improve the unified grain purchase and supply work in cities, the following methods should be adopted on the basis of continuing to implement the grain planned supply policy and the ideological education of grain saving: First, for the supply of rations to citizens, the population must be verified, the plan must be determined by household, and the supply must be verified; second, for institutions, troops, enterprises, schools, and organizations, the phenomenon of falsely reporting and fraudulently receiving grain must be resolutely eliminated, and a strict grain pre-budget and final account system must be implemented; third, while strengthening the management of grain supply in urban areas, the unified grain purchase and supply work in the suburbs of the city and the neighboring rural areas must be done well, so as not to affect each other and cause chaos; fourth, in conjunction with household registration management, strengthen the grain purchase management of the mobile population, strictly implement the method of registering people when they come and canceling when they leave, and supplying grain based on certificates, and effectively prevent purchasing and transporting grain; fifth, for the grain used by urban industries, the planned management should be strengthened, and illegal acts should be seriously educated and dealt with; sixth, implement the method of classifying and quantitatively supplying livestock feed based on certificates; seventh, effectively adjust the supply network and do a good job of assigning areas and fixed points to manage households. These measures must be resolutely and correctly implemented in order to change the current loose phenomenon in urban grain supply work and achieve the purpose of correctly implementing the planned supply.

As long as the responsible comrades of the party and government at all levels earnestly grasp the unified grain purchase and supply work, they will surely be able to change the current situation.

### 中华人民共和国粮食部负责人　就粮食统销问题发表谈话

　　中华人民共和国粮食部负责人
　　就粮食统销问题发表谈话
    新华社三十日讯　最近据各地反映：不少地区农村粮食统销情况紧张，城市粮食统销也存在不少问题，新华社记者就这些问题今天访问了中华人民共和国粮食部负责人，承他发表谈话如下：
    粮食部负责人首先说明目前不少地区农村粮食统销情况紧张，就全国情况说，不是由于去年统购粮食过多，也不是今年对农村统销粮食过少所致。他着重指出主要原因是由于农村统销工作没有认真做好。首先从统购数量来看，一九五四年粮食总产量比上一年度尚有增加，国家向农民征收、收购粮食的计划较上一年度并未增加，不过由于去年若干省份遭受百年来少有的大洪水，国家为了支援灾区人民渡过灾荒，弥补灾区减征减购和需要多销的粮食，才在非灾区适当多收购了一些粮食，只有在这些地区的一部分农民才感到收购数量比上年多了一些。其次从统销数量来看，自一九五四年七月到一九五五年六月粮食年度全国销售粮食指标比上一年度约增加一百亿斤。国家今年为了保证对城乡人民的粮食供应，在许多省份不但未增加库存还动用了部分的国家原有的库存周转粮。由此可见，国家对城乡人民是尽了最大的努力来保证供应的。特别是对灾区人民，国家在全国范围内大力调运粮食给予及时供应，不仅保证了灾区人民的口粮需要，还保证了籽种的供应，使灾区人民生活得到保障，生产得到迅速的恢复。同时在去年这样大的灾荒情况下，还保持粮价的稳定，从而有利于整个市场的稳定，也就有利于国家社会主义建设的顺利进行。
    粮食部负责人继续指出：可能有人会认为我国农村粮食的紧张状况，是与粮食出口有关。事实上国家每年出口的粮食，是根据需要与可能，有计划有控制的，数量是不多的，它只占国内城乡销售总额的百分之四左右，对国内市场供应应该没有影响，而且这也是国家为实现社会主义工业化所必需的。
    关于当前城乡粮食统销存在的主要问题及今后改进办法，粮食部负责人着重指出：当前农村的粮食统销情况，由于去冬今春许多地区统购工作和统销工作没有很好结合进行，基层干部心中无底，掌握偏松，结果造成供应面广、量大，如今年三月份有的省销售量等于供应了全省三分之二的人口，有些县等于供应了全部人口，这说明不论供应面和供应量都显然是超过了缺粮人民的实际需要的，其中必然有一部分是虚假的，这是极不正常的现象。目前农村粮食统销工作固然还存在该供应的没有供应或供应不足的情况，但更多的情况是不该供应的供应了，或该少供应的多供应了。根据这个时期各地统销补课的情况看，问题的严重性不在于少数真正缺粮农民得不到合理的供应有意见，这是应当而且必须予以解决的；问题的严重性是在于有许多不缺粮的甚至有余粮的农民存在不正常的心理紧张，也在盲目叫喊“缺粮”，甚至带头叫喊要求供应，弄得真假难分，而我们有许多基层干部也不分析情况，就盲目地跟着叫喊，对统销工作放任自流，甚至有些地区少数基层干部还有徇私舞弊的情况，再加上不法地主、富农和潜伏的反革命分子的乘机挑拨破坏，就造成人为的紧张。这就是当前不少地方农村粮食供应紧张的基本原因。许多地方农村统销工作的经验证明，只要端正了干部思想，使他们对统购统销工作有正确的认识，深入地发动群众；进行充分的政治工作和群众工作，将统销指标向群众公布，经过充分的酝酿和反复的讨论，逐户进行评议，真正缺粮户是可以得到合理供应，不该供应和可以少供应的部分是可以减少下来的。如江苏苏州专区已结束统销补课工作的五十六个乡，群众原要求的供应数量普遍缩减，一般下降百分之三十，个别下降到百分之七十。
    现在我们的任务就是要根据国务院、中共中央关于加紧整顿粮食统销工作的指示，大力进行整顿农村统销工作。
    至于当前城市的粮食供应工作，粮食部负责人指出：过去销得太松了。这首先表现在机关、部队、企业、学校、团体中浪费粮食的现象相当普遍和严重。农民对这种现象是不满意的。少数机关、企业单位甚至破坏国家粮食政策，竟将多领的粮食转手以高价卖给私商、小贩或附近农民，从中牟利，这是不能容忍的行为，必须严肃对待，认真检查处理。其次是对一般行业用粮、居民口粮和流动人口供应管理太松。所谓划片定点，凭证购粮的办法，在许多城市中已完全处于不负责任的自流状态，以致普遍存在着套购外运现象。自去年九月到现在，半年多来城市供应数量不断增加，超过国家规定的计划指标，这种不够正常的情况也必须及时加以扭转。近一个多月来，全国各大、中城市已先后开展节约粮食运动，对广大的职工和居民进行了一次比较深刻的节约粮食的教育，提高了大家对节约粮食的认识，创造了不少节约粮食的办法，因此，这一次节约粮食运动，不论在政治上和经济上都收到一定的效果，今后仍需继续坚持下去，但由于供应管理还缺乏全面有效的措施，因此城市粮食销量却未见下降反而有些城市仍在增加。为了进一步加强和改进城市的粮食统销工作，目前应在继续贯彻粮食计划供应政策和节约粮食的思想教育的基础上，采取下列办法：一、对市民口粮的供应，必须查实人口，按户确定计划，核实供应；二、对机关、部队、企业、学校、团体，要坚决消灭浮报冒领的现象，实行严格的粮食预决算制度；三、在加强管理市区粮食供应的同时，必须做好城市郊区及邻县的农村粮食统销工作，以免互相影响，造成紊乱；四、结合户口管理工作，加强对流动人口的购粮管理，严格实行来人登记、去时注销，凭证供应的办法，切实防止套购、捣运粮食；五、对城市行业用粮，应加强计划管理，对违法行为，认真地进行教育和处理；六、对牲畜饲料实行分类定量凭证供应的办法；七、切实调整供应网，做好划片定点，以点管户的工作。这些措施必须坚决的正确贯彻，以改变目前城市中粮食供应工作偏松的现象，达到正确执行计划供应的目的。
    只要各级党政负责同志认真抓紧粮食统销工作，就一定能够改变目前的情况。
