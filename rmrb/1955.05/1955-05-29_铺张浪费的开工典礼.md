　　Extravagant Opening Ceremony

To the Editor:
    The 501 Factory of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry held a grand opening ceremony to celebrate the completion of the first phase of basic construction. It was extravagant and wasteful, costing more than 50,000 yuan.
    The person in charge of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau attached great importance to the opening ceremony of the 501 Factory. He repeatedly instructed the factory by telegram to "hold a grand ceremony" and proactively increased the 30,000 yuan ceremony fee proposed by the 501 Factory to 50,000 yuan. Spending such a large sum of money all at once at a ceremony was a big problem for those responsible for preparing the ceremony. But with money, of course, there's no shortage of ways to spend it. On the one hand, the 501 Factory, under the guise of renovating the factory's appearance, carried out large-scale construction: repairing roads, painting, and leveling the ground. This renovation cost more than 11,000 yuan. On the other hand, they sent people to major cities to purchase ceremony supplies. For example, more than 140 bolts of cotton cloth and silk were purchased for making arches, pavilions, and colorful flags, worth more than 4,000 yuan. They also bought tens of thousands of catties of various foods (meat, fish, chicken, wine, candy, coffee...), a steel wire recorder, a large number of photographic equipment, electrical materials, portraits of great men, and various appliances for the guesthouse. They had almost everything, even things they shouldn't have.
    In order to show the grandeur of the ceremony, the superior authorities specially sent people to provide specific guidance and arrange the reception work of the conference, and organized 55 young men and women to serve as ribbon-cutters and banquet attendants. They printed exquisite visitor's manuals and customized several thousand silver and copper commemorative badges. In addition, they also invited a troupe and band of more than one hundred people from afar.
    In addition to the factory's employees and the heads of relevant agencies, more than 3,300 staff members from local factories, mines, banks, courts, post and telecommunications, newspapers and other departments were invited to participate in the celebration ceremony. All guests and factory employees were treated to lavish meals free of charge. The total consumption of pork and fish alone was more than 11,000 catties, worth nearly 5,000 yuan. And because there were too many kinds of food prepared, they did not finish eating them that day, leaving behind 64 whole pigs, more than 800 catties of fish, and a large number of cigarettes, alcohol, and candy. The troupe performed for four consecutive nights. According to statistics, the ceremony cost a total of more than 51,600 yuan.
    In a time when everything is for socialist construction, such extravagant and wasteful behavior by the 501 Factory cannot but be a fault to the country and the people. We believe that the Ministry of Heavy Industry should prevent similar things from happening again in the future.

### 铺张浪费的开工典礼

　　铺张浪费的开工典礼编辑同志：
    重工业部有色金属工业管理局五○一厂，为庆祝第一期基本建设工程完工，曾举行了一个盛大的开工典礼，铺张浪费，花了五万多元。
    有色金属工业管理局的负责人很重视五○一厂的开工典礼，曾几次用电报指示该厂要“隆重举行”，并且把五○一厂拟定的三万元典礼费，主动地增加为五万元。这么大一笔钱要在一次典礼会上全部花掉，对负责筹备典礼的人来说，却是一个很大的难题。但是有了钱，当然不愁没有出路。五○一厂一方面以整修厂容为名，大规模地兴工动土：修路、粉刷、平场，这项整修费就用去一万一千多元。另方面，则派人到各大城市采购典礼用品。例如，为扎彩门、牌楼和做彩旗就买了一百四十多匹棉布和纺绸，价值达四千多元。还买了上万斤的各种食品（肉、鱼、鸡、酒、糖果、咖啡……）、钢丝录音机、大批照像器材、电器材料、伟人像以及招待所的各种器具，简直是应有尽有，不应有的也有了。
    为了显示典礼的隆重，上级机关特别派来了专人具体指导和安排大会的招待工作，组织了五十五个男女青年，分别担任剪彩和宴会的招待工作；精印了参观手册，订制了几千枚银质和铜质的纪念章。此外，他们还从远道请来了一百多人的剧团和乐队。
    参加庆祝典礼的人，除本厂职工和有关机关首长外，还邀请了当地厂矿、银行、法院、邮电、报社等部门工作人员三千三百多人。并且用丰盛的饭菜免费招待了所有的来宾和全厂职工。共计吃去猪肉、鱼两项就有一万一千多斤，价值近五千元。且由于各种食品准备得太多了，当天没有吃完，还剩下毛猪六十四头、鱼八百多斤和大批的烟、酒和糖果。剧团连续进行了四个晚上的演出。据统计这次典礼一共用去五万一千六百多元。
    在一切为着社会主义建设的时候，五○一厂这样的铺张浪费的行为，对国家和人民来说，不能不是一种过失，我们认为重工业部应该防止以后再发生类似的事情。
