　　Dawn Shines on Tibet
Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet in May 1951, the economic and cultural life of the Tibetan people has significantly improved under the guidance of the correct ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　The full opening of the Kang-Tibet Highway and the Qing-Tibet Highway has further promoted the economic prosperity of Tibet and strengthened the close ties between Tibet and the mainland. The amount of goods transported to Lhasa, Qamdo, Heihe, and other places via these two highways is increasing daily. The prices of goods in major towns have decreased by about 10% compared to before the opening of the highways. The variety of goods has increased by approximately 400 types compared to before the opening of the highways.

　　曙光照耀着西藏
    西藏人民从一九五一年五月西藏和平解放以来，在中国共产党正确的民族政策的指引下，经济、文化生活都有了显著的改善。
    康藏公路和青藏公路全线通车以后，更进一步地促进了西藏经济的繁荣和加强了西藏同祖国内地的紧密联系。从这两条公路运到拉萨、昌都、黑河等地的货物，日益增多。各主要城镇的货物比通车前降低了百分之十左右。货物的品种比通车前增加了约四百种。
