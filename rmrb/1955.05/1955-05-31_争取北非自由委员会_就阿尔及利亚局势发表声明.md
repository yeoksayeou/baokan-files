　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 29th (TASS): According to Agence France-Presse, the Committee for the Freedom of North Africa (which includes representatives from the Tunisian Neo-Destour Party, the Moroccan Istiqlal Party, and the Algerian National Liberation Front) issued a statement in Cairo on the situation in Algeria.

　　The committee stated that "the people of Tunisia and Morocco stand in solidarity with their struggling Algerian brothers and sisters, treating the struggle of the Algerian people as their own struggle for a common cause." The committee pointed out that "the military operations that began in Algeria just weeks after the Bandung Conference adopted a resolution supporting the struggles of the people of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia are a challenge to all people who hope for a peaceful resolution to the North African problem."

　　The committee called on the United Nations Security Council to "use its full authority to end the state of war created by France in Algeria, which gravely threatens peace in the Mediterranean region." The committee also suggested that the twenty-nine participating countries of the Bandung Conference "demand that the French government cease military operations in Algeria and strive for a peaceful resolution to this problem in conjunction with the true representatives of the Algerian people."

　　The committee strongly condemned the leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for allowing "the use of troops under the organization's control in Algeria, thus becoming an accomplice to the universally condemned colonialism." The committee finally called on the member states of the Arab League to "support Algeria by issuing a firm diplomatic statement to the French government."

　　争取北非自由委员会
  　就阿尔及利亚局势发表声明
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社巴黎二十九日讯：据法新社报道，争取北非自由委员会（参加这个委员会的有突尼斯新宪政党、摩洛哥独立党和阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的代表）在开罗就阿尔及利亚局势发表了声明。
    委员会表示“突尼斯和摩洛哥人民声援正在进行斗争的阿尔及利亚兄弟人民，把阿尔及利亚人民的斗争当作是他们为了共同的目的而进行的斗争”。委员会指出：“在万隆会议通过关于支持阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯人民的斗争的决议几个星期后在阿尔及利亚开始的军事行动，是对于所有希望和平解决北非问题的人民的挑战。”
    委员会要求联合国安全理事会“使用它的全部权威来结束法国在阿尔及利亚所造成的严重地威胁到地中海地区和平的战争状态”。委员会还建议万隆会议二十九个参加国“要求法国政府停止在阿尔及利亚的军事行动，力求同阿尔及利亚人民的真正代表一道和平解决这一问题”。
    委员会严厉谴责了北大西洋联盟的领导机构，因为它允许“在阿尔及利亚使用受这一组织支配的军队，因而成为到处受到谴责的殖民主义的帮凶”。委员会最后要求阿拉伯联盟的会员国“向法国政府发表坚决的外交声明，以此支援阿尔及利亚”。
