Farmers in the hemp-producing areas of Zhejiang Province are actively sowing ramie. Seventeen key hemp-producing counties, including Shaoxing and Haining, have completed more than half of their ramie sowing plans, and Xiaoshan County has finished planting 180,000 mu of hemp fields.

Zhejiang Province is a major ramie producing area in China. This year, according to the state plan, it is necessary to expand the planting of ramie by 700,000 mu, an increase of 53 percent over last year, with a total output increase of 87 percent. In order to ensure the realization of this year's expanded hemp field plan, before sowing, local Party organizations at all levels, in conjunction with publicizing the "Three Fixes" policy for grain, educated hemp farmers to obey the state planting plan. The Provincial Department of Agriculture also transferred technical cadres and organized 62 people, including experienced hemp farmers and labor models from old hemp areas, to form a new hemp planting work team, which went to seven counties, including Pingyang, Ruian, Yiwu, and Jinhua, to impart hemp planting experience. As a result, farmers in the hemp-producing areas are actively expanding planting areas and improving cultivation techniques. Hemp farmers in Yongjia, Ruian, and Pingyang counties have expanded their hemp planting plan from 12,000 mu to 37,000 mu. (Our correspondent in Hangzhou)

　  浙江产麻区扩大种麻面积
    浙江省产麻区农民正积极播种络麻。绍兴、海宁等十七个重点产麻县已完成络麻播种计划的一半以上，萧山县十八万亩麻田已经种完。
    浙江省是我国络麻主要产区，今年按国家计划需要扩大种植络麻七十万亩，比去年扩大百分之五十三，总产量增加百分之八十七。为保证今年扩大麻田计划的实现，在播种前，当地中共各级党组织结合宣传粮食“三定”政策向麻农进行了服从国家种植计划的教育。省农业厅还抽调了技术干部和组织老麻区有经验的麻农、劳动模范等六十二人，成立了新区植麻工作队，分别到平阳、瑞安、义乌、金华等七县传授植麻经验。因而产麻区农民都积极扩大播种面积，改进耕作技术。永嘉、瑞安、平阳三县麻农已从一万二千亩的种麻计划扩大到三万七千亩。　（本报驻杭州记者）
