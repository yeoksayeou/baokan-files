　  Haizhou Open-Pit Mine Tries New Coal Mining Method
    The Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine has recently piloted a "layered coal mining method" that prevents coal and gangue from mixing, increasing the coal recovery rate by 10% compared to the national standard.
    The Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine is a multi-seam mine, and many coal seams have complex structures, often with a single coal seam being divided into several sub-layers by gangue of varying thicknesses. During coal mining, a large amount of gangue mixes into the coal. Because the coal preparation plant cannot fully separate it, about 1,400 tons of raw coal are lost every day because it cannot be selected. After using the "layered coal mining method," it is possible to mine coal first where there is coal, and remove gangue first where there is gangue, so that coal and gangue do not mix.

### 海州露天矿试用新的采煤法

　  海州露天矿试用新的采煤法
    海州露天煤矿最近试行了一种使煤和夹石不致混杂的“分层采煤法”，使煤的回采率比国家规定标准提高百分之十。
    海州露天煤矿是多煤层的矿，许多煤层结构很复杂，往往一个煤层被厚度不等的夹石分成好几个分层。采煤时，大量的夹石就混入煤中，因为选煤厂不能全部选出，每天总有一千四百吨左右原煤因选不出来而丢掉。使用“分层采煤法”后，就能做到有煤先采煤，有夹石先扬夹石，煤和夹石混不起来。　（新华社）
