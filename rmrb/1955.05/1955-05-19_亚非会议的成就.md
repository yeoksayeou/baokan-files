　　Achievements of the Asian-African Conference
　　Huang Yanpei
    From April 18 to 24, 1955, government representatives from 29 countries in Asia and Africa held a seven-day conference in Bandung, Indonesia. This was unprecedented in Asian-African history.
    There have been many international conferences in Asian-African history, so why is this Asian-African conference said to be unprecedented? In the past, what everyone was accustomed to seeing and hearing were conferences of the great powers, conferences in which a few Western powers manipulated the fate of Asian and African countries. If smaller countries participated, they were treated unequally. But this conference was attended by no Western colonial powers, and all participating countries, regardless of size, were equal, discussing issues of common concern. Can this not be said to be an unprecedented event? At the same time, among these 29 participating countries, there were differences in social systems, differences in political views, and complex situations such as various relationships with each other and among themselves. Despite this, representatives from these many countries gathered together, held a meeting, and held a successful meeting. Can this not be said to be unprecedented?
    The vast majority of people in the world are against war and striving for peace, especially the people of small and weak countries, whose fear and aversion to war is conceivable. Furthermore, which country, especially a small and weak country, does not demand national independence and national self-determination, and which one does not oppose colonialism? And this conference clearly put forward and reflected this common desire of the peoples of 29 countries, large and small.
    However, we see that such an international conference, which conformed to the wishes of the Asian and African people, was met with frantic hostility and sabotage by US imperialism. Originally, friendship, peace, and cooperation among countries in the world are fundamentally incompatible with the imperialist policy of aggression. US imperialism used all its power to carry out slander, libel, and instigation, attempting to widen the divisions among Asian and African countries and undermine the success of this conference.
    First is the US ruling group's hostility to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. These five principles were first included in the Sino-Indian agreement on the Tibet region, and then in the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese Prime Ministers' joint communiqués, and have been agreed upon and accepted by many countries successively. Article 9 of the joint communiqué issued by the five initiating countries also required the invited countries to remember this principle:
  "The form of government and way of life of any country should not be interfered with by any other country." This should have been deeply and commonly understood by all participating countries. Unexpectedly, some representatives at the conference proposed a so-called "document on coexistence and international communism," making unwarranted accusations against peaceful and democratic countries, provocatively demanding that our country's representatives express their views; and some individual representatives even demanded that the meaning of peaceful coexistence be "clarified."
    When mentioning opposition to colonialism, some country representatives tried their best to defend US colonialism; some country representatives defended various aggressive military group organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty; and some even slandered not only our country, but also the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    The US imperialists are extremely shameless. It attempts to undermine the unity of the 29 countries and undermine the success of this conference.
    We will never forget that on the eve of the Asian-African Conference, US-Chiang Kai-shek agents created the "Kashmir Princess" plane incident, massacring more than ten staff members of the Chinese and Vietnamese delegations, Chinese and foreign journalists, and Indian aircraft maintenance personnel.
    However, slander, libel, and instigation, and all kinds of tricks, cannot ultimately reverse right and wrong. Take "US aid," for example. Of the 3.53 billion US dollars in US "aid" to Asia, military projects account for 77 percent. Wherever US "aid" goes, US military bases that threaten peace are established, which proves that the sole purpose of the United States is to promote the policy of "using Asians to fight Asians." This is something that everyone can see clearly.
    Therefore, through the joint efforts of the vast majority of the representatives of the participating countries, the conference finally reached a unanimous agreement after seven days of discussion.
    Premier Zhou Enlai, head of our country's delegation, showed sincerity and tolerance from beginning to end, holding the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and kindly and correctly stated the heartfelt words of the representatives of many participating countries, and the common aspirations of the people of Asia and Africa, so that the conference overcame obstacles and achieved success. Moreover, Premier Zhou emphatically expounded our country's peaceful foreign policy at the conference, dispelling misunderstandings, eliminating doubts, and enhancing mutual understanding between our country and Asian and African countries among the representatives of the participating countries.
    The discussions in small groups, off-site consultations, individual and extensive contacts also greatly helped the conference.
    It was in this context that the conference was successful. What was successful? Please read the final communiqué of the conference, mainly:
    Basic human rights are respected;
    The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries are respected;
    It is recognized that all races are equal and that large and small countries are equal;
    Non-interference or intervention in the internal affairs of other countries;
    Colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil that should be eradicated quickly.
    All armed forces and armaments must be rapidly promoted for control, restriction, supervision and reduction, and the production, testing and use of all weapons of mass destruction must be finally prohibited.
    Two other points of great significance are: not to use collective defense arrangements to serve the special interests of any great power;
    No country should exert pressure on other countries.
    The closing meeting adopted the last important resolution, written at the end of the communiqué, which is "to suggest that the five initiating countries, in consultation with the participating countries, consider the issue of convening the next session of the Asian-African Conference." This communiqué was adopted in the warm applause of the entire audience, and representatives of large and small countries unanimously praised the success of the conference.
    However, the achievements of the Asian-African Conference still require the twenty-nine participating countries to consolidate and develop it wholeheartedly.

　　亚非会议的成就
　　黄炎培
    一九五五年四月十八日至二十四日，亚非两洲二十九个国家的政府代表在印度尼西亚的万隆举行了七天会议。这是亚非历史上没有前例的。
    亚非历史上国际性的会议多得很，怎么说这次亚非会议是史无前例的呢？过去大家惯见习闻的是列强会议，是少数西方大国摆布亚非国家命运的会议，如果有弱小国家参加，它们所遭到的待遇是不平等的。而这次会议没有一个西方殖民国家参加，所有与会国家，不分大小，一律平等，一起来商讨同它们共同有关的问题，这不能说不是空前的事情。同时，在这二十九个与会国家中有着社会制度的不同，政治观念的不同，以及彼此间、相互间种种关系问题等的复杂情况。尽管这样，这许多国家的代表却集合一堂，开成了会，而且开好了会，这也不能说不是空前的事情。
    世界上绝大多数人民都在反对战争，争取和平，特别是弱小国家人民，它们对战争的惊恐和厌恶，是可想而知的。还有一点，任何国家，特别是弱小国家，那一个不要求民族独立、民族自决，那一个不反对殖民主义呢？而这次会议明明白白地提出了和反映了大大小小二十九个国家人民的这个共同愿望。
    但是，我们看到，这样一个符合于亚非人民愿望的国际会议竟受到美国帝国主义的疯狂敌视和破坏。原来世界各国间友好、和平、合作，是同帝国主义侵略政策根本不能相容的。美帝国主义用尽了一切力量，进行诽谤、诬蔑和挑拨离间，企图扩大亚非国家间的分歧，破坏这次会议的成功。
    首先是美国的当政集团对于和平共处五项原则的敌视。这五项原则，是最早订入中印关于西藏地区的协定，接下来订入中印、中缅总理会谈公报，先后还经许多国家同意接受的。五个发起国发表的联合公报第九条也要求被邀请国记住这条原则：
  “任何一国的政府形式和生活方式绝不应受到任何其他国家的干涉。”这应该是与会各国深切地共同了解的了。不意会议上竟有代表提出所谓“共处和国际共产主义的文件”，对和平民主国家横加诬蔑，挑衅地要求我国代表有所表示；还有个别代表竟要求把和平共处的含义加以“澄清”。
    在提到反对殖民主义时，竟有某国代表竭力为美国殖民主义辩护；有某国代表为北大西洋公约等种种侵略军事集团组织辩解；甚至还有人不但诬蔑了我国，还诬蔑苏联和人民民主国家。
    美帝国主义者无耻极了。它企图破坏二十九个国家的团结，破坏这次会议的成功。
    我们永远也不会忘记，在亚非会议前夕美蒋特务制造了“克什米尔公主号”飞机事件，惨杀了中、越代表团的工作人员、中外记者及印度机务人员十多人。
    然而，诽谤、诬蔑、挑拨离间种种伎俩，到底颠倒不了是非黑白。就以“美援”来说吧，对亚洲的美“援”三十五亿三千万美元中间，军事项目占到百分之七十七。美“援”到处，威胁和平的美国军事基地也就建立起来，这就证明，美国的惟一目的只想推行“以亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策。这是人人都能够看清的。
    因此，在绝大多数与会国家代表团的共同努力下，会议经过七天讨论，终于取得了一致的协议。
    我国代表团团长周恩来总理自始至终表现了恳切、容忍的气度，抱着求同存异的精神，亲切地、正确地道出了许多与会国家代表的心里话，道出了亚非两大洲人民的共同愿望，使会议克服了障碍，取得了成就。并且，周总理在会上着重地阐明了我国的和平外交政策，使各与会国家的代表解除误解，冰释疑虑，增进了我国同亚非各国之间的相互谅解。
    这次会议，小组的讨论，会外的协商，个别的和广泛的接触，对会议也是有很大帮助的。
    就在这种情况下，会议获得了成功。成功些什么？请读会议最后公报，主要是：
    基本人权得到尊重；
    一切国家的主权和领土完整得到尊重；
    承认一切种族是平等的，大小国家是平等的；
    不干预或干涉他国内政；
    殖民主义在其一切表现中是一种祸害，是应当迅速予以根除的。
    一切武装力量和军备是要迅速促成管制、限制、监督和裁减的，一切大规模毁灭性武器的生产、试验和使用必须加以最后禁止。
    还有两点有重要意义的是：不使用集体防御的安排来为任何一个大国的特殊利益服务；
    任何国家不对其他国家施加压力。
    闭幕会议上通过了最后一点重要决议，写上公报末尾，就是“建议五个发起国在同与会国协商下，考虑召开亚非会议下届会议的问题。”就在全场热烈的掌声中通过了这份公报，大小各国代表发言一致赞扬会议成功。
    但是，亚非国家会议的成果，还需要与会二十九个国家一心一意地来巩固它、发展它。
