　　Not "Small Matters"
　　Kong Sang
    The sanitation team of the state-owned Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory has been picking up a lot of good cloth that has been thrown away from all corners of the factory every day for several years. Last year alone, more than 10,000 jin of discarded good cloth was picked up from all parts of the factory. This year, more than 2,000 jin of cloth scraps and strips have been picked up from the garbage dump dumped out of the workshop, including more than 1,000 jin of cloth pieces larger than one chi; in March, more than two zhang of printed gabardine and fine cloth were also pulled out of the drain.
    The factory leadership's frequent praise of the workers in the sanitation team for their attitude of being masters of their own affairs in cherishing state property is completely justified. However, strangely enough, all that is seen is the factory leadership praising this act of picking up cloth and cherishing state wealth, but no one has ever thought of any way to stop the wasteful behavior of throwing away good cloth. It is said that the cadres of this factory do not think such things are worth "making a fuss about" and are "nothing new". The factory director put it well: "We have been in the factory for a long time, we are used to seeing it, and we have become accustomed to it."
    Why don't these people treat state property with the attitude of masters of their own affairs like the workers in the sanitation team, and why don't they cherish the fruits of the labor of the working people? One of the main reasons is that these comrades have a "big business, don't care" mentality. In the past few years, they have seen the enterprise grow from small to large and develop, so they have become "rich and powerful" and think that wasting "a little bit" is a "small matter" and doesn't matter.
    If a workshop loses a few jin a day, it will pick up 10,000 jin a year, which is equivalent to more than 1,000 bolts of cloth. According to the current average cotton cloth supply for the general population in the country, it can supply more than 2,000 people. Is this really a small matter? Of course, most of the discarded cloth is cloth strips and cloth pieces, but even cloth strips and cloth pieces can be used to make shoe uppers, children's clothing, and other uses, and should never be wasted at will.
    In our personal expenditures, we calculate every jiao and every yuan. When managing a large enterprise, with larger expenditures, we should be even more diligent and meticulously calculate every bit. Only in this way can we avoid continuing to waste indifferently, and only then will we realize that it is absolutely necessary to correct this "small matter".

### 不是“小事情”

　　不是“小事情”
　　孔桑
    国营天津印染厂的卫生队，几年来每天都要从厂内各个角落里捡出很多被扔掉的好布。去年一年，从厂内各处捡出被丢弃的好布有一万多斤。今年又从车间倒出来的垃圾堆里捡出两千多斤布头和布条，其中一尺以上的布块就有一千多斤；三月份，还从地沟里掏出两丈多长印花哔叽和细布。
    卫生队的工人们这种爱护国家财产的主人翁态度，经常受到厂里领导上的表扬，这是完全应该的。但是，奇怪的是：只看到这个厂的领导上表扬这种捡布的爱护国家财富的行为，却没有人想过用什么办法来制止乱扔好布的浪费行为。据说，这个厂的干部认为这样的事情并不值得“大惊小怪”，“不是什么新鲜事”。厂长说得好：“我们在厂里呆久了，看惯了，也就熟视无睹了。”
    为什么这些人没有像卫生队的工人们那样以主人翁的态度来对待国家财产，不珍惜劳动人民的劳动成果呢？其中一个主要原因是这些同志有一种“大家业，不在乎”的思想。几年来，他们看到企业由小到大，有了发展了，于是就“财大气粗”起来，认为浪费“一星半点”是“小事情”，不算什么。
    一个车间一天丢几斤，一年捡到的就有一万斤，等于一千多匹布。按照目前全国一般人的平均棉布供应量来计算，就可以供应二千多人。这难道还是小事吗？当然，被丢弃的这些布大多是布条、布块，但是，即使是些布条、布块也可用来做鞋面布，小孩衣裤以及其他的用途，决不应该任意糟踏。
    在我们个人的支出中，一角钱一元钱都有个计算。管理一个大的企业，支出大了，就更应该兢兢业业一点一滴地时刻计算着。只有这样，才不致熟视无睹地继续浪费，才知道纠正这种“小事情”是大有必要。
