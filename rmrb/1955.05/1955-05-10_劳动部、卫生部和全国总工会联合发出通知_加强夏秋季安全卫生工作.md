　　The Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Health, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Jointly Issue a Notice
　　Strengthening Safety and Health Work in Summer and Autumn
    The Ministry of Labor of the People's Republic of China, the Ministry of Health, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly issued a notice on May 5th to strengthen safety and health work in the summer and autumn seasons. The notice pointed out that in order to do a good job in this year's summer and autumn safety and health work, all localities must carefully summarize last year's experiences and lessons, and urge local factories and mines to conduct a safety and health inspection before the arrival of summer and autumn.

    The notice requires relevant departments in various localities to promote and assist factories and mining enterprises in making early preparations for ventilation and cooling. It urges enterprises to inspect and calibrate existing ventilation and cooling equipment, and strengthen maintenance and management to prevent equipment failure. For units that have already developed ventilation and cooling plans, they should be urged to carry out construction and installation according to the plan as soon as possible; strictly prevent the phenomenon of blindly copying, mechanically applying, or hastily constructing without technical design and construction plans. All localities should try their best to organize experienced technicians, engineers, and skilled workers in the local area to conduct technical research in order to provide technical guidance and assistance to the ventilation and cooling work of factories and mining enterprises. All localities should pay special attention to carefully studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in ventilation and cooling, and adopt economical and effective cooling methods such as natural ventilation and spray fans. In addition to strengthening ventilation and cooling work, workers working in high-temperature workshops should be provided with salt soda water or other cool drinks, and it should be checked whether the manufacture and supply of these drinks meet the requirements.

    The notice requires all relevant departments to conduct a safety inspection of the electrical equipment of factories and mining enterprises before the rainy season in conjunction with the electricity management departments and relevant units. Areas that have already conducted inspections and made some improvements last year should prevent possible slack and paralysis thinking. In addition to solving existing equipment problems during the inspection, they should also establish and improve the maintenance, management, and operation systems for electrical equipment. Areas that have not been inspected in the past and have more problems should focus on conducting a safety inspection of electrical equipment, formulating plans, and carrying out work with emphasis. In general factories and mines, attention should be paid to solving problems such as insulation and grounding devices for motors, electric drills, inspection lamps, and local lighting equipment, as well as the use of safe voltages. Construction sites should pay special attention to whether the erection of temporary lines and the suspension distance of high and low voltage lines meet safety requirements. The motors on site, especially mobile machinery, should have grounding devices that meet the specifications; strictly prevent the occurrence of random wiring and random installation of lights. In addition, various methods should be used to strengthen the publicity and education of basic knowledge of safe electricity use, so that workers can correctly understand the role, hazards, and methods of preventing electric shock.

    The notice also requires all relevant departments to promptly inspect temporary buildings such as staff dormitories and work sheds at factory and mine construction sites, as well as dangerous factory buildings that have been in disrepair for many years. If there are phenomena such as rain leaks, corrosion, tilting, or sinking, they must be repaired and reinforced in a timely manner. Workplaces located in low-lying areas or near rivers should carry out flood control and drainage work such as building dikes and digging ditches to prevent accidents caused by excessive rainwater or river surges. Sites located on hillsides or valleys should be inspected frequently to prevent landslides and rockfalls from injuring people during the rainy season, and any dangerous collapses must be dealt with as soon as possible.

    The notice requires relevant departments in various localities to do a good job in the sanitary management of canteens, and vigorously conduct health publicity and education work to employees and their families, and do a good job in personal hygiene; ensure that workshops provide sufficient boiled water, improve the workshop drinking water system, and units using river water and well water as water sources must implement disinfection.

    The notice finally requires labor and health administrative departments and trade union organizations in various localities to determine the key points of the summer and autumn inspections in light of these requirements and in conjunction with the specific conditions of the local area, formulate plans, and fully mobilize the masses to do a good job in safety and health work in the summer and autumn.

　　劳动部、卫生部和全国总工会联合发出通知
　　加强夏秋季安全卫生工作
    中华人民共和国劳动部、卫生部和中华全国总工会，五月五日联合发出加强夏、秋季安全卫生工作的通知。通知指出：为了做好今年夏、秋季安全卫生工作，各地必须认真总结去年的经验教训，督促当地厂矿企业，在夏、秋季到来之前进行一次安全卫生检查。
    通知要求各地有关部门推动和协助厂矿企业及早做好通风降温准备工作。督促企业对已有的通风降温设备进行检修校验，加强维护管理，以防设备失效。对已订出通风降温计划的单位，应督促其及早按照计划施工装置；严格防止盲目抄袭、生搬硬套或没有做技术设计和施工计划便草率施工的现象。各地应尽量组织当地有经验的技术人员、工程师和技术工人进行技术研究，以便对厂矿企业的通风降温工作给予技术上的指导和帮助。各地应该特别注意认真学习苏联在通风降温方面的先进经验，采用自然通风和喷雾风扇等既经济又有效的降温方法。除加强通风降温工作外，对于在高温车间工作的工人，应供给盐汽水或其他清凉饮料，并检查这些饮料的制造和供应是否合乎要求。
    通知要求各有关部门在雨季之前会同电业管理部门及有关单位，对厂矿企业的电器设备进行一次安全检查。去年已作过检查并有了一些改进的地区应防止可能发生的松懈麻痹思想，在检查中除应解决存在的设备问题外，并应建立、健全电器设备的检修、管理、操作等制度。过去未作过检查而存在问题又较多的地区，应着重对电器安全进行一次检查，订出计划，有重点地开展工作。一般厂矿中应注意解决马达、电钻、行灯及局部照明设备等的绝缘、接地装置和改用安全电压等问题。建筑工地应特别注意临时线路的架设和高低压线路的悬吊距离是否合乎安全要求，现场的电动机，特别是流动性的机械要有合乎规格的接地装置；严防乱拉线、乱装灯现象的发生。此外，并应利用各种方式加强安全用电基本知识的宣传教育，使工人正确认识电的作用、危害性及防止触电的办法。
    通知还要求各有关部门要及时对厂矿工地的职工宿舍、工作棚等临时性建筑及年久失修的危险厂房进行检查，如有漏雨、腐损、倾斜、下沉等现象，必须及时补修加固。地势低洼或靠近河流的工作场所，应进行筑堤、挖渠等防洪、排水工作，防止因雨水过大或河流暴涨发生事故。设在山坡或山谷的现场，为防止雨季土石崩落伤人，应经常进行检查，发现有崩落危险时须及早处理。
    通知要求各地有关部门要作好食堂的卫生管理工作，并大力向职工及其家属进行卫生宣传教育工作，作好个人卫生；保证供给车间工人足够的开水，健全车间饮水制度，采用河水、井水为水源的单位并须实施消毒。
    通知最后要求各地劳动、卫生行政部门及工会组织，应根据这些要求，结合当地具体情况，确定夏秋季检查重点，订出计划，充分发动群众，做好夏、秋季的安全卫生工作。　（新华社）
