　　How Model Township in Qianshan County Rectified the Grain Unified Purchase and Sales Work
　　You Qun

    Model Township in Qianshan County, Anhui Province, relied on the masses to rectify the grain unified purchase and sales work, and achieved good results.

    The harvest in Model Township, Qianshan County in 1954 was not bad, but by mid-March of this year, the number of households in the township approved for grain supply reached 51.4% of the total number of households in the township. Even so, some people were still clamoring that the grain supply was not enough. The cadres were clueless and followed the masses in complaining to higher authorities.

    The main reason for the tense grain supply situation was that after the unified purchase of grain in this township, the unified sales work was not well discussed by the masses, resulting in extremely unreasonable phenomena, such as supplying grain to those who should not have been supplied. For example, in the Tongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative, 80% of the households who should not have been supplied received grain. In the Center Agricultural Production Cooperative, there were 25 households, of which only 6 were short of grain. The other 19 households, seeing that the households in the Tongxing Cooperative who were not short of grain received supplies, also demanded supplies. They believed that not demanding supplies meant "honest people suffer." Some surplus grain households were afraid of revealing their wealth and also clamored for grain shortages. A well-to-do middle peasant, who had several hundred catties of grain left over after consumption, complained everywhere, even kneeling before the cadres to demand supplies. Bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors and incite people, saying that whoever did not demand supplies proved that he had "a thick foundation" and "did not sell enough grain." Influenced by these rumors, some people demanded grain supplies from the state.

    When the masses demanded an increase in supplies, the township cadres, either because they were clueless or irresponsible for the supply work, adopted an attitude of granting every request. Whoever shouted the loudest received a certificate to increase supplies. For example, in the Seventh Election District, out of a total of 47 households, only a few were originally short of grain, but as everyone clamored, the number of households needing supplies increased to 40. As a result, other election districts also demanded that cadres increase supplies. In early April, the instructions of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on rectifying the unified purchase and sales work had already been issued, and certificates could no longer be issued casually. The township cadres were afraid of offending the masses and adopted a "dragging" approach, telling the masses: "Wait a little longer, the district government has not approved it yet." Many cadres, seeing that the masses were shouting loudly, did not dare to educate the masses on the grain unified purchase and sales policy.

    In April, a work team came to Model Township to help rectify the grain unified purchase and sales work. They first went to the Center Agricultural Production Cooperative to work, carried out ideological education for the activists among the cooperative members, and relied on these activists to understand the real situation of those who clamored for grain shortages by calculating output and expenses. The result was that, apart from the six households that were truly short of grain, the other nineteen households were non-grain-short households who were just clamoring along. At the same time, it was also discovered that the cooperative had two thousand catties of rice that had not been distributed to the members or sold to the state. After a detailed investigation in this cooperative, the township cadres were educated, became more knowledgeable, stopped blindly following the masses in complaining, and gained confidence in rectifying the unified purchase and sales work.

    Next, the Center Agricultural Production Cooperative convened a general meeting of all cooperative members. The work team, together with the cooperative cadres, mobilized the members at the meeting, explained the benefits of unified purchase and sales, and pointed out that it was meritorious for farmers to increase production and save, and sell grain to the state to support industrial construction, support the liberation of Taiwan, and support the disaster-stricken compatriots. At the same time, they commended the exemplary figures who had made achievements in increasing production and saving, criticized the erroneous behavior of those who deliberately demanded an increase in supplies, and exposed the sabotage activities of bad elements. This laid the foundation for rectifying the unified purchase and sales work.

    After the cooperative member meeting, the cooperative held small-scale informal discussions to further enhance the cooperative members' understanding of the unified purchase and sales work by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the unified sales work for the country and the farmers themselves. During the discussions, some cooperative members said: "We only care about asking for more. If we exceed the supply plan, the state will have to take the grain for disaster relief and give it to us. How can we be worthy of the disaster-stricken farmers?" Some said: "If we households that are not short of grain do not ask the state for more, the state can save grain to support construction, and we can also reduce our expenses." Cooperative member Huang Chunhua also said: "It is wrong for us to only remember ourselves and forget the country and the farmers who are short of grain." He said that he did not want the state to supply more grain. After the meeting, he and other activists used individual contact and consultation methods to persuade other cooperative members not to ask the state for more grain. Under their influence, the mother of cooperative member Wang Quanfa took out the rice hidden upstairs and no longer wanted the state to supply it.

    After the members of the Center Agricultural Production Cooperative independently adjusted the amount of grain supplied, the work team used the facts of this cooperative to educate the cadres and the masses throughout the township, and commended the eighteen saving models. Soon, eighty-three households in the four agricultural production cooperatives in the township proposed not to receive supplies, and other people also proposed not to receive or to receive less supplies. Originally, there were two hundred and forty-four households in the township requesting supplies. After the rectification, only one hundred and forty-eight households requested supplies. After the grain supply problem was reasonably resolved, the enthusiasm of the farmers in the township for production was high, and they were actively carrying out spring plowing.

　　潜山县模范乡怎样整顿粮食统销工作
　　友群
    安徽省潜山县模范乡依靠群众整顿粮食统销工作，收到了很好的效果。
    潜山县模范乡一九五四年的收成并不坏，可是到今年三月中旬，全乡批准供应粮食的户，竟达到全乡总户数百分之五十一点四。就这样，部分群众还在叫嚷粮食供应不够。干部心中无数，也跟着群众向上级叫起苦来。
    造成粮食供应紧张局面的原因，主要是这个乡在统购粮食以后，统销工作没有经过群众很好讨论，发生了不该供应的也都供应了的极不合理的现象。如同兴农业生产合作社有百分之八十不该供应的户得到了供应。中心农业生产合作社有二十五户，本来只有六户缺粮，其他十九户看到同兴社不缺粮的户得到了供应，也都要求起供应来了。他们认为不要求供应，就是“老实人吃亏”。有些余粮户怕露富，也叫喊缺粮。一个富裕中农本来除吃以外还余几百斤粮食，但他到处叫苦，甚至给干部下跪要求供应。坏分子乘机造谣煽动，说谁不要求供应，就证明他“底子厚”，“卖粮不彻底”。部分群众在这些谣言影响下，都向国家要求供应粮食。
    在群众要求增加供应时，乡干部因心中无数或对供应工作不负责任，就采取了有求必应的态度，谁叫的最多，就给谁开证明条子，增加供应。如七选区共四十七户，本来只有几户缺粮，大家一叫嚷，需要供应的就增加到了四十户。这样一来，别的选区也都要求干部增加供应。四月上旬，中共安徽省委整顿统销工作的指示已经下达，不能随便开条子了，乡干部怕得罪群众，就采取“拖”的办法，对群众说：“等一等吧，区政府还没有批下来。”不少干部看见群众叫的多，竟不敢向群众进行粮食统销政策教育。
    四月里，工作组到模范乡帮助整顿粮食统销工作。他们首先到中心农业生产合作社进行工作，对社员中的积极分子进行了思想教育，并依靠这些积极分子，用算产量，算开支的办法，了解了全社叫喊缺粮的人的真实情况。结果发现除六户真正缺粮的以外，其他十九户都是跟着叫嚷的不缺粮户。同时，还发现社里有两千斤稻谷没有分给社员，也没有卖给国家。经过在这个社详细摸底，乡干部受到了教育，心中有了数，不再盲目跟着群众叫苦了，并且对整顿统销工作有了信心。
    接着，中心农业生产合作社召开了全社社员大会，工作组协同社干部在会上进行了动员，对社员讲解了统购统销的好处，并说明农民增产节约、卖粮给国家，对于支援工业建设、支援解放台湾、支援灾区同胞是有功劳的，同时还表扬了增产节约有成绩的模范人物，批判了故意要求增加供应量的人的错误行为，并揭发了坏分子的破坏活动。这就给整顿统销工作打下了基础。
    开过社员大会以后，这个社又召开了小型漫谈会，漫谈统销工作做得好坏，对国家和对农民本身的利害关系，进一步提高了社员对统销工作的认识。漫谈中，有的社员说：“我们只管多要，如果突破了供应计划，国家就要拿支援灾区的粮食给我们，那怎样对得起灾区的农民弟兄。”有的说：
  “我们不缺粮的户不向国家多要，不但国家可以节省下粮食去支援建设，而且自己也可以减少开支。”社员黄春华还说：“我们只记得自己，忘了国家和缺粮的农民弟兄是不对的。”他表示自己不要国家多供应粮食。会后，他和其他积极分子，用个别串通和协商的办法，使其他社员也不多要国家供应粮食。社员汪全法的母亲在他们的影响下，把藏在楼上的米拿了出来，不要国家供应了。
    中心农业生产合作社社员自行调整了粮食供应量以后，工作组就用这个社的事实向全乡干部和群众进行教育，并表扬了十八户节约模范。很快全乡四个农业生产合作社中就有八十三户提出不要供应，其他群众也纷纷提出不要或少要供应。原来全乡要求供应的有二百四十四户，经过整顿以后，要求供应的只一百四十八户了。粮食供应问题得到了合理解决以后，全乡农民生产情绪高涨，都在积极进行春耕生产。
