　　Today is the 36th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, and this year is also the third year of China's first Five-Year Plan. Under the close care and leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the broad masses of Chinese youth have achieved good results in their studies and work in various positions, in order to realize the country's general task during the transition period and to realize the first Five-Year Plan. However, the cause of socialist construction requires us to further cultivate young people into people with high political consciousness, rich cultural and scientific knowledge, strong bodies, and noble morality, so that they can shoulder the great task of building a socialist society.
    Under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League held its Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee in February this year, and passed the "Resolution on Strengthening Youth Spare-Time Cultural Work" and the "Decision on Convening the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism." This is of great significance to the current youth work.
    China currently has 120 million young people, of which only 4 million are engaged in formal study in secondary and higher schools; more than 110 million are distributed in factories, mines, enterprises, rural areas, government offices, troops, and other positions, engaged in production and various construction undertakings. China's socialist construction事业 requires them to have the great ideals of communism, and all kinds of necessary scientific and technological knowledge, and at the same time requires them to have healthy bodies. However, among the young workers and peasants, there are still about 70 percent illiterates and semi-illiterates, and among the Youth League members, there are still 50 percent illiterates and semi-illiterates, and the phenomenon of the lack of scientific and technological knowledge among the broad masses of young people is even more widespread. In this way, they will inevitably encounter many difficulties in their labor production, hindering them from playing a greater role. What they often feel distressed about is "Say a thousand, say ten thousand, you can't do anything without technology"; "Without culture, you lack a sense of awareness". Therefore, they are eager to learn culture and learn scientific and technological knowledge.
    People can see that various spare-time technical schools are crowded with young workers; young people in many rural areas have spontaneously organized study groups. According to Hunan statistics, in the ten counties and suburban areas of a city in the two special districts of Xiangtan and Shaoyang alone, there are 3,693 study groups; among them, three counties and one city are doing better, with more than 63,000 people participating in the study. At the same time, with the gradual improvement of people's lives, the broad masses of young people are also eager to participate in various lively and vivid cultural, artistic and sports activities. Many young people in factories and mining enterprises are not satisfied with the existing cultural and recreational life, they say: "Our life is the same old routine, production, meetings and sleeping." This should arouse our serious attention and must be actively improved.
    In order to meet the requirements of the broad masses of young people for cultural and technical learning and cultural, artistic and sports activities, the "Resolution on Strengthening Youth Spare-Time Cultural Work" adopted by the Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Youth League determined that: it is necessary to systematically eliminate illiteracy among young people and improve the cultural, scientific and technical level of young people; organize and guide young people to read books and newspapers; carry out spare-time art activities; and carry out sports activities. The implementation of this resolution will undoubtedly make the broad masses of young people healthy, lively, happy people, people with knowledge and skills who can shoulder the responsibility of defending and building the motherland. The implementation of this resolution will also make the relationship between the Youth League organization and the broad masses of young people closer, play a greater organizational and educational role among the youth masses, and prevent some young people from pursuing improper entertainment in their spare time, acquiring bad habits, and affecting their physical and mental health.
    At present, many advanced elements are constantly emerging among the broad masses of young people. We should always pay attention to continue to cultivate them, spread their advanced experience, publicize their excellent qualities, and drive the broad masses of young people forward. This is the most vivid and concrete way to improve the consciousness of young people. The "Decision on Convening the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism" adopted by the Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Youth League embodies the spirit of positive education of young people and actively guiding young people forward. Young people are full of ideals, have enthusiasm, are willing to learn, are combative, are sensitive to new things, and are creative. They need encouragement, support and help. This requires the adoption of active guidance methods, the establishment of good role models, and the research and summarization of the wisdom of the youth masses and the experience of engaging in creative activities, and then popularization to the youth masses.
    At the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism to be held this year, we will see outstanding young people from all walks of life gather together to exchange and spread advanced experience. The broad masses of young people will find things they should learn from their own partners, as a force to constantly encourage themselves to move forward.
    Convening a congress of activists should become a working method that all groups, especially the grassroots organizations of the Youth League, should use frequently. Using this method can constantly discover new activists and constantly provide the youth masses with models for learning. These activists will also become an important source for the development of the Youth League organization.
    The Party's leadership organs at all levels should supervise the Youth League organizations and relevant departments at all levels to actively implement these two resolutions. Recently, more attention has been paid to the work of cultivating young activists in various places, and some experience has been accumulated; however, there are still many difficulties in organizing young people's spare-time cultural learning. Some comrades do not care enough about the requirements of young people, which is wrong; some comrades think that the requirements of young people are too many and difficult to meet one by one, which is an incomplete view. The various requirements of young people should be analyzed specifically. Many of the requirements of young people should be met, and there are currently conditions to meet them; some should be met, but there are no conditions to meet them today; and others cannot be met, nor should they be met. All those that should be met and can be met should be resolutely met. For example, the requirements of the broad masses of young people for cultural and technical learning and cultural, artistic and sports activities are obviously legitimate and reasonable, and there are conditions to meet them, which should be met.
    Organizing young people's spare-time cultural work and convening a congress of activists are important components of communist education for young people. The purpose of communist education is to improve the communist consciousness of the masses and improve the cultural and technical level of the masses. To make young people understand that their wisdom and ability should be used to serve the people's cause, this is the essence of communist education. We must gradually cultivate young men and women into true communists in the process of various tasks.
    The year 1955 is a decisive year for China's implementation of the first Five-Year Plan. The tasks of various departments of the national economy will be more arduous than in 1954. For the victory of China's socialist construction and socialist transformation, we should better give play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of young people, carry forward the glorious tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement, and strive to comprehensively complete the various indicators of the national plan.

### 用具体切实的方法培养和教育青年

　　用具体切实的方法培养和教育青年
    今天是“五四”运动三十六周年纪念日，今年又是我国第一个五年计划的第三年。我国广大青年在共产党和人民政府亲切的关怀和领导下，为实现国家在过渡时期的总任务，为实现第一个五年计划，在学习和工作的各个岗位上取得了良好的成绩。但是，社会主义建设事业还要求我们进一步把青年培养成为有高度的政治觉悟、有丰富的文化科学知识、有强健的身体和高尚道德的人，使他们能够担当起建设社会主义社会的伟大任务。
    在中国共产党中央的直接领导下，中国新民主主义青年团中央在今年二月间举行了二届二中全会，通过了“关于加强青年业余文化工作的决议”和“关于召开全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的决定”。这对于当前的青年工作是有重要意义的。
    我国现有一亿二千万青年，其中只有四百万人在中等以上学校进行正规学习；还有一亿一千多万人则分布在工厂、矿山、企业、农村、机关、部队和其他岗位上，从事生产和各种建设事业。我国社会主义的建设事业要求他们具有共产主义的伟大理想，具有各种必要的科学技术知识，同时要求他们有健康的身体。但在工农青年中目前却还有百分之七十左右的文盲和半文盲，在青年团员中也还有百分之五十的文盲和半文盲，而广大青年缺乏科学技术知识的现象就更加普遍。这样，他们在劳动生产中就不可避免地要遇到许多困难，妨碍了他们发挥更大的作用。他们常常感到苦闷的是“说一千，说一万，没有技术不能干”；“没有文化，少一个心眼”。因此他们迫切要求学习文化，学习科学技术知识。
    人们可以看到，目前各种业余技术学校挤满了青年工人；不少地方的农村青年自动地组织了学习小组。据湖南统计，单是湘潭、邵阳两个专区的十个县和一个城市的郊区，就有学习小组三千六百九十三个；其中办得较好的有三县一市，参加学习的人数有六万三千多人。同时，随着人民生活的逐步改善，广大青年还迫切要求参加各种生动活泼的文艺体育活动。许多厂矿企业里的青年，对于现有的文化娱乐生活是不满足的，他们说：“我们的生活老一套，生产、开会和睡觉。”这是应该引起我们的严重注意的，必须努力加以改善。
    为了满足广大青年的文化技术学习和文艺体育活动的要求，青年团二届二中全会通过的“关于加强青年业余文化工作的决议”确定：要有步骤地扫除青年中的文盲，提高青年的文化科学技术水平；组织和指导青年阅读书报；开展业余艺术活动；开展体育活动。这个决议的贯彻执行无疑地将会使广大的青年成为健康、活泼、愉快的人，成为有知识、有本领，能够担负起保卫和建设祖国的责任的人。这个决议的贯彻执行也将会使青年团的组织同广大青年的关系更加密切，在青年群众中发挥更大的组织和教育的作用，并防止某些青年在业余时间追寻不正当的消遣，沾染不良的习气，以致影响身心健康的现象。
    目前广大青年中有许多先进分子正在不断涌现。我们应该经常注意继续培养他们，传播他们的先进经验，宣扬他们的优良品质，带动广大青年前进。这是提高青年觉悟的一个最生动最具体的办法。青年团中央二届二中全会通过的“关于召开全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的决定”，体现了对青年的正面教育和积极引导青年前进的精神。青年人富于理想，有热情，肯学习，战斗性强，对于新鲜事物感觉敏锐，富于创造性。他们需要鼓励、支持和帮助。这就必须采用积极引导的方法，必须树立好的榜样，必须把青年群众的智慧和从事创造性活动的经验，加以研究和总结，再推广到青年群众中去。
    在今年将要召开的全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上，我们将会看到各方面的青年优秀人物聚集一堂，交流和传播先进经验。广大青年将从他们自己的伙伴身上找到自己应当学习的东西，作为不断鼓舞自己前进的力量。
    召开积极分子大会应该成为所有的团体，特别是青年团的基层组织经常运用的工作方法。运用这个方法可以不断地发现新的积极分子，经常给予青年群众以学习的榜样。这些积极分子也将成为青年团组织发展的重要泉源。
    党的各级领导机关应该监督各级青年团组织和有关部门积极贯彻这两个决议。近来各地关于培养青年积极分子的工作已比较重视，并积累了一些经验；但是，组织青年的业余文化学习却还有不少困难。有的同志对于青年的要求不够关心，这是不对的；有些同志认为青年的要求太多，很难一一满足，这是不全面的看法。对青年的各种要求应当作具体分析。青年的要求有许多是应该满足，而且目前也有条件满足的；有些是应该满足，而今天还没有条件满足的；另外有些是不能满足，也不应当满足的。凡是应该满足而且能够满足的，就要坚决予以满足。例如广大青年对文化技术学习和文艺体育活动的要求显然是正当的，合理的，而且也有条件来满足的，这就应当予以满足。
    组织青年的业余文化工作和召开积极分子大会，是对青年进行共产主义教育的重要组成部分。共产主义教育的目的就是要提高群众的共产主义觉悟，提高群众的文化技术水平。使青年们懂得把自己的智慧和能力用在为人民的事业服务方面，这就是共产主义教育的实质。我们要在各项工作的过程中，把青年男女逐渐培养成为真正的共产主义者。
    一九五五年是我国实施第一个五年计划具有决定意义的一年。国民经济各部门的任务都将比一九五四年更为繁重。为了我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的胜利，我们应当更好地发挥广大青年群众的积极性，发扬“五四”的光荣传统，为全面完成国家计划的各项指标而努力奋斗。
