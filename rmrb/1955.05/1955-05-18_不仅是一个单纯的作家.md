　  “Not Just a Simple Writer”
    Ling Qian
    After reading Shu Wu's "Some Materials Regarding the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique," the insidious and ugly face of Hu Feng's anti-Marxism and anti-Party, anti-people stance is further exposed.

  From these materials revealed by Shu Wu—it can be asserted that this is only a small portion of the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique's materials—it can be seen how Hu Feng, under the self-proclaimed name of "organizer of literary work standing at the Party's periphery," engaged in anti-Party, anti-people activities. Hu Feng viciously referred to the Party's literary workers as "officials," "masters," "dignitaries," "mandarin gowns," "emissaries," and "young masters," called the Party "the officialdom," and progressive literary writers as "local bullies," "rising philistines," and "maggots"; he denounced Mr. Wen Yiduo's progress as "opportunism," regarded the commemoration of Lu Xun as a "disaster" for him, and called the commemoration of Qu Yuan a "mask changing opera." Merely from these terms of address, one can see the extreme animosity and hatred Hu Feng held towards the Party and progressive writers inside and outside the Party, and the extreme animosity and hatred he held towards the Party's revolutionary literary cause and the Party. It is now very clear that Hu Feng is "not just a simple writer;" he is far from simple, and we must expose his true face. His repeatedly rewritten and patched-up "My Self-Criticism" is also a deceptive fabrication that cannot withstand scrutiny, and we must sternly criticize and refute it.

　  “不仅是一个单纯的作家”
    凌茜
    看了舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”后，胡风的反马克思主义、反党反人民的阴险丑恶的面貌，进一步暴露出来了。
  从舒芜揭发的这些材料——可以肯定，这只是胡风反党集团的很少一部分材料——可以看出，胡风是怎样窃据着自封的“站在党底周围的文学工作的组织者”的名义，干着反党反人民的勾当。胡风把党的文艺工作者恶毒地称为“官们”、“老爷们”、
  “权贵”、“马褂”、“钦差”、“公子们”，把党称为“官方”，把进步文艺作家称为“豪绅们”、
  “抬头的市侩”、“蛆虫”；把闻一多先生的进步骂为“投机”，把纪念鲁迅当作对他的“灾难”，把纪念屈原的活动称为“跳加官”。仅仅从这些称呼语气来看，也可以看出胡风对党的和党外的进步作家，是抱着怎样的极端敌视和仇恨的态度，对党的革命文艺事业，对党抱着怎样的极端敌视和仇恨的态度。已经很清楚，胡风“不仅是一个单纯的作家”，他很不单纯，我们必须揭露他的真面目。他的一再改写、补缀起来的“我的自我批判”，也是见不得太阳的假东西，我们必须严正地加以批驳。
