　　Lively Art Activities at the State-Owned First Rubber Factory
      In the state-owned First Rubber Factory in Northeast China, a group of workers regularly engage in art activities in their spare time. They use art to promote production, conduct propaganda and education, and help workers constantly change various bad habits in their lives and production.
    Among these amateur artists, thirty-seven have basically learned to paint. Since last year, they have created more than 1,500 cartoons. Some of these praise advanced individuals and model deeds, while others criticize and expose backward phenomena such as violations of labor discipline, damage to regulations, and a lack of care for public property. For example, the problem of drug leakage in the closed-type rubber mixing machine in the factory's First Workshop has not been solved for a long time, resulting in a large waste of medicinal materials and affecting product quality. Worker Zhou Dayao wanted to use the method of tightening the "tension ring" to solve this problem; but many workers opposed it, saying, "All methods have been exhausted in the past year. To prevent drug leakage, unless you replace the machine!" After the amateur artists learned about this, they gained a deeper understanding and drew a series of picture stories, which strengthened Zhou Dayao's confidence and finally led to the success of his innovation. They used specific examples of losses caused to the state by some workers in the factory violating labor discipline as the theme to draw ten picture stories, which promoted inspections in various production groups. Waste of water and electricity in the factory and workers fighting in the dormitory have also been corrected due to timely criticism from the cartoons.　(Song Sheng)

　　国营第一橡胶厂美术工作活跃
      在东北的国营第一橡胶厂中，有一批工人在业余经常做美术工作，他们用美术来推动生产，进行宣传教育，帮助工人们不断改变生活中和生产中各种不良的习惯。
    这批业余美术工作者中已有三十七人基本学会了作画，从去年到现在，他们已创作了一千五百多幅漫画。其中有表扬先进人物、模范事迹的，也有批评和揭发违犯劳动纪律、破坏制度和不爱护公共财物等落后现象的。如这个厂第一车间密闭式炼胶机的漏药问题，长期没法解决，药料浪费很大，并且影响产品质量。工人周大垚要用紧“涨圈”的办法来解决这个问题；但许多工人都反对说：“一年来办法使尽了，要想不漏药，除非换机器！”业余美术工作者们知道后，经过深入了解，画了一套连环画，坚定了周大垚的信心，使他的创造终于获得了成功。他们以厂内部分工人违犯劳动纪律给国家造成了损失的具体事例为题材，画了十幅连环画，推动了各个生产小组进行了检查。厂内浪费水电、工人在寝室内打闹等现象，也由于漫画的及时批评而获得纠正。　（松生）
