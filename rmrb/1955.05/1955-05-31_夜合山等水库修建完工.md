The newly built Yeheshan Reservoir in Sanxing Township, Pingjiang County, and the restored Baogaidong Reservoir project in the Fourth District of Liuyang County, both old revolutionary base areas in Hunan Province, have been fully completed in early May this year, starting from last winter. The more than 8,000 mu of paddy fields in the irrigation areas of these two reservoirs will henceforth receive sufficient water for irrigation. It is estimated that the annual increase in rice production will be approximately 1.6 million jin. Currently, the reservoirs have begun storing water, freeing parts of the irrigation area from the threat of drought and ensuring timely rice transplanting.

Baogaidong Reservoir is one of the largest reservoirs in the province, built in the spring of 1953. In July 1954, excessive rainfall caused the reservoir dam to be breached by mountain floods. In this restoration project, the quality of the work was improved compared to the original construction. The Yeheshan Reservoir, with its dam body entirely made of reinforced concrete, is the first reinforced concrete flat slab dam in the province.

　  夜合山等水库修建完工
    湖南省平江县三星乡和浏阳县四区等革命老根据地新建的夜合山水库和宝盖洞水库修复工程，从去年冬季开始，已先后在今年五月上旬全部竣工。这两座水库灌区内的八千多亩稻田，从此得到了充分的水源灌溉。估计每年可增产稻谷一百六十万斤左右。目前水库已开始蓄水，并使灌区部分稻田免除旱灾威胁，保证了按时插秧。
    宝盖洞水库为全省最大的水库之一，是一九五三年春天建成的。一九五四年七月由于雨水过多，水库堤坝曾被山洪冲垮。在这次修复工程中，工程质量较新建时又有改进。夜合山水库，坝身完全由钢筋混凝土制成，为全省第一座钢筋混凝土平版坝。　（本报集体通讯员新湖南报编辑部）
