Fujian Province will build, expand, and restore fourteen rosin factories of various sizes this year. Among them, five rosin factories planned to be newly built in Nan'an, Dehua, Ningde, Yongtai, Wuping and other places are expected to be completed in the third quarter. At present, the new factories are actively conducting surveys, selecting sites, and collecting data, and are applying to order equipment from both inside and outside the province. Old factories in various places will also transfer some skilled technicians to support the construction of new factories.
    After these newly built and expanded rosin factories are put into production, Fujian Province's rosin production this year will increase by 2.4 times compared with 1954, which is about 20 times that before the War of Resistance Against Japan. In addition to supplying the needs of industrial departments such as soap, papermaking, paint, rubber, cellophane, and sealing wax at home and abroad, the products will also be supplied for export. It is estimated that the export portion can earn the country more than 6.4 million jin of fertilizer.

　　福建将新建扩建十四个松香厂
    福建省今年将新建、扩建和恢复十四个大小松香厂。其中计划在南靖、德化、宁德、永泰、武平等地新建的五个松香厂，估计第三季度就可完工。目前各新建厂正在积极进行调查勘测，选择厂址，搜集资料，分别向省内外申请订购器材设备。各地老厂也将抽调部分熟练技工，支援新厂的建设工作。
    这些新建、扩建的松香厂投入生产以后，今年福建省的松香产量将比一九五四年增加二点四倍，约等于抗日战争前的二十倍。产品除供应省内外肥皂、造纸、油漆、橡胶、透明胶、玻璃纸、火漆等工业部门的需要外，还将供应外销。估计外销部分可为国家换回肥田粉六百四十多万斤。
