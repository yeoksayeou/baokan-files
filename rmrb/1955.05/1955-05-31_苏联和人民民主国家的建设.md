    Construction in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries

    Rationalization Proposals Flourish in Soviet Factories

    Inventions and rationalization proposals are flourishing in many factories in the Soviet Union.

    In the Russian Federation, one in six workers at the Molotov Automobile Factory in Gorky is a rationalization proposer. At the tractor factory in Lipetsk, thanks to staff inventions and rationalization proposals, cost reductions alone saved 5 million rubles in the first quarter of 1955.

    In Ukraine, the Kharkov Transport Machine Manufacturing Plant has adopted more than 500 valuable innovative suggestions from workers since the beginning of this year.

    The Minsk Tractor Factory in Belarus has implemented more than 700 significant rationalization measures. Now, one in four production workers uses high-speed metal cutting methods.

    Soviet Union Achieves Results Using Geochemical Methods to Find Oil

    Exploration teams in the lower Volga River region, Turkmenistan, and other areas of the Soviet Union have achieved highly effective results using geochemical methods to find oil and natural gas.

    The geochemical method is the latest way to explore for oil. According to scientists' research, hydrocarbon and other gases in oil layers often move along crustal fissures, escape to the surface, and seep into aquifers above the oil layer. This seepage of natural gas creates favorable conditions for the reproduction of certain bacteria. Explorers collect air, soil, or water samples in the exploration area for testing based on this principle. By checking the samples for petroleum gas or accompanying substances and bacteria, they can infer whether there are oil and natural gas deposits in the area. Using this method can greatly save drilling expenses.

    North Korea Restores Important Production Equipment at Hungnam Fertilizer Factory

    The famous Hungnam Fertilizer Factory in North Korea, currently under reconstruction, has recently restored a set of production equipment with an annual capacity of 30,000 tons of ammonium sulfate fertilizer, which will soon be put into production. The ammonium sulfate fertilizer produced by this set of production equipment can meet about one-third of the agricultural needs of northern Korea.

    The Hungnam Fertilizer Factory mainly produces ammonium sulfate fertilizer. The production equipment restored this time includes a series of complex and sophisticated machines such as compressors, electric motors, synthesis towers, and gas tanks. During this restoration, with the help of Soviet technicians, some unreasonable equipment was modified, extending the lifespan of some equipment and expanding production capacity.

    East German People's Chamber Approves This Year's Economic Plan

    The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic discussed and unanimously approved the 1955 national economic plan on the 20th and 21st, and approved the 1955 national budget law and the 1954 final accounts.

    The meeting heard a report by Rauschner, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the German Democratic Republic, on the 1955 national economic plan. Rauschner pointed out that according to the 1955 national economic plan, the total industrial output will increase by 5.1% compared with 1954 (including private industry). The focus will be on developing major industries such as coal mining, metallurgy, chemicals, and heavy machinery, and increasing electricity production. Agricultural output will increase by 17% compared with 1954. The republic's foreign trade will increase by 5%. The national investment in 1955 will increase by 17%, of which investment in the entire industry will increase by 12%. The plan stipulates that labor productivity will be increased by 5.2%.

    Loch, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of the German Democratic Republic, made a report on the 1955 national budget and the 1954 final accounts. Loch pointed out that the national income of the German Democratic Republic in 1955 will increase by 8% compared with 1954. The income of publicly owned enterprises will increase significantly.

    Many Romanian Enterprises Complete the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule

    Many industrial enterprises across Romania have completed the production tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) ahead of schedule. Industrial enterprises that completed the Five-Year Plan nine months ahead of schedule alone include: 62 industrial enterprises under the Ministry of Metallurgical and Machine-Building Industry, 24 industrial enterprises under the Ministry of Chemical Industry, 14 industrial enterprises under the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, 10 industrial enterprises under the Ministry of Woodworking, Paper and Pulp Industry, 23 industrial enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry, and 24 industrial enterprises under the Ministry of Food Industry, etc.

    The early completion of the Five-Year Plan by various industrial departments and enterprises powerfully reflects the rapid growth of Romanian industrial production. For example, the electrical equipment industry, which completed the Five-Year Plan early in early May, has increased its total output to more than three and a half times that of 1950, and its labor productivity has increased to 2.2 times.

    Bulgarian Workers Strive to Improve Productivity

    The movement to improve labor productivity and reduce costs, initiated by 25 advanced enterprises in Sofia City and Province, is unfolding across Bulgaria. Many industrial enterprises completed their May plans ahead of schedule during the movement.

    More than 8,000 workers in the machine manufacturing industry have put forward specific guarantees in the movement. They put forward more than 1,000 rationalization proposals in the first four months of this year alone. Workers at the state-owned spare parts factory saved the country 500,000 leva (Bulgarian currency) in the first four months of this year and increased labor productivity by 35.2%.

    Hungarian Workers Strive to Complete Production Plans Ahead of Schedule

    Workers from 20 large factories in Budapest recently jointly issued a call to workers across Hungary, calling on them to launch a labor competition, to help the Party fight against right-leaning opportunism with action, strive to complete the 1955 production plan ahead of schedule, and vigorously carry out conservation. The initiators put forward their own competition guarantees in the call. Workers at the Csepel Automobile Factory guaranteed to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule on December 24, reducing production costs by 3.5%. Workers at the Budapest Crane Factory guaranteed to complete the annual production plan by December 20.

    The competition has now begun. The first batch of respondents to the competition call include the Lang Machine Factory, the "Hungarian" Chemical Factory, and the United Glue Factory.

    Albanian Workers Launch Large-Scale Competition

    This year is the last year of Albania's first Five-Year Plan. In order to successfully complete the national plan, the Albanian working people have launched a large-scale competition and have achieved significant achievements.

    The staff and workers of various enterprises in the national industry completed the national plan by about 4% above the target in the first four months of this year. In the first four months of this year, the production of the machine manufacturing industry increased by more than 18%, the power industry increased by about 11%, and the timber industry increased by 42.7%.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联工厂合理化建议工作蓬勃开展
    苏联许多工厂的发明和合理化建议的工作蓬勃地开展着。
    在俄罗斯联邦，高尔基市莫洛托夫汽车工厂的工人有六分之一是合理化建议者。利佩茨克市的拖拉机工厂，由于工作人员的发明和合理化建议，在一九五五年第一季度中，仅在减低成本方面就节约了五百万卢布。
    在乌克兰，哈尔科夫市的运输机器制造厂今年年初以来已经采用了工人们五百多项宝贵的革新建议。
    白俄罗斯明斯克拖拉机工厂已经实现了七百件以上的合理化重大措施。现在每四个生产工人中就有一个人使用金属高速切削法。
    苏联用地球化学法寻找石油取得成果
    苏联伏尔加河下流、土库曼和其他地区的勘察队，在利用地球化学方法寻找石油和天然气方面已经取得十分有效的成果。
    地球化学法是最新的勘察石油的办法。根据科学家研究，石油层中的碳氢气体和其他气体往往沿地壳裂隙运动，跑出表面，渗入油层上的含水层。这种渗透的天然气为某几种细菌的繁殖创造有利的条件。勘察者就根据这种原理在勘察地区收集空气、土壤或水的试样进行化验。检查试样中有无石油气或随伴它的物质和细菌，就可推定这个地区有无石油和天然气的矿床。利用这种方法可以大大节省钻探的开支。
    朝鲜修复兴南肥料工厂重要生产设备
    重建中的朝鲜著名的兴南肥料工厂最近修复了一套年产三万吨硫铵肥料的生产设备，不久就要投入生产。这套生产设备所生产的硫铵肥料可供朝鲜北部农业需要的三分之一左右。
    兴南肥料工厂主要生产硫铵肥料，这次修复的生产设备包括压缩机、电动机、合成塔、煤气罐等
  一系列的复杂和精密的机器。这次修复时在苏联技师的帮助下，改造了一部分不合理的设备，使得一些设备比原来延长了寿命，扩大了生产能力。
    民主德国人民议院通过今年经济计划
    德意志民主共和国人民议院在二十日和二十一日讨论并一致通过了一九五五年的国民经济计划，批准了一九五五年国家预算法案和一九五四年的决算。
    会议听取了德意志民主共和国国家计划委员会主席劳施纳关于一九五五年国民经济计划的报告。劳施纳指出，根据一九五五年的国民经济计划，工业的总产量要比一九五四年增加百分之五·一（包括私营工业在内），重点将放在发展采煤、冶金、化学、重型机器等主要工业和增加电力的生产上。农业产量要比一九五四年增加百分之十七。共和国的对外贸易要增加百分之五。一九五五年的国家投资额将增加百分之十七，其中对整个工业的投资将增加百分之十二。计划规定把劳动生产率提高百分之五·二。
    德意志民主共和国副总理兼财政部长洛赫作了关于一九五五年国家预算和一九五四年决算的报告。洛赫指出，德意志民主共和国一九五五年的国民收入将比一九五四年增长百分之八。公有企业的收入将大大增加。
    罗马尼亚许多企业提前完成五年计划
    罗马尼亚全国有许多工业企业提前完成了五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）所规定的生产任务。单是提前九个月完成五年计划的工业企业就有：冶金和机器制造工业部的六十二个工业企业，化学工业部的二十四个工业企业，建筑材料工业部的十四个工业企业，木工、造纸与纸浆工业部的十个工业企业，轻工业部的二十三个工业企业和食品工业部的二十四个工业企业等。
    提前完成五年计划的各工业部门和企业有力地反映着罗马尼亚工业生产的迅速增长。例如，五月初提前完成五年计划的电气设备工业，它的总产量已经增为一九五○年的三倍半以上，它的劳动生产率已经增为二点二倍。
    保加利亚工人努力争取提高生产率
    由索非亚市和州的二十五个先进企业发起的争取提高劳动生产率和减低成本的运动，正在保加利亚全国展开。许多工业企业在运动中提前完成了五月份计划。
    机器制造业中有八千多个工人在运动中提出了具体保证。他们单在今年头四个月中，就提出了一千多件合理化建议。国营备件工厂的工人在今年头四个月中给国家节省了五十万列弗（保币名）的资金，把劳动生产率提高了百分之三十五点二。
    匈牙利工人争取提前完成生产计划
    布达佩斯二十个大工厂的工人最近联合向匈牙利全国工人发出号召书，号召展开劳动竞赛，以行动帮助党对右倾机会主义进行斗争，争取提前完成一九五五年生产计划和大力进行节约。发起者在号召书中提出了自己的竞赛保证。蔡佩尔汽车工厂的工人保证十二月二十四日提前完成全年计划，降低生产成本百分之三点五。布达佩斯起重机工厂的工人保证到十二月二十日完成全年生产计划。
    现在竞赛已经展开，第一批响应竞赛号召的有朗格机器制造厂、“匈牙利”化学工厂、联合制胶工厂等。
    阿尔巴尼亚工人展开规模巨大的竞赛
    今年是阿尔巴尼亚第一个五年计划最后的一年，阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民为了胜利完成国家计划，展开了规模巨大的竞赛，并已取得了显著的成就。
    国家工业的各个企业的职工在今年头四个月超额百分之四左右完成了国家计划。今年头四个月，机器制造工业的生产增加了百分之十八以上，动力工业增加了约百分之十一，木材工业增加了百分之四十二点七。　（据新华社讯）
