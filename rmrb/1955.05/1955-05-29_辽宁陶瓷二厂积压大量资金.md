To the Editor:

    In February 1955, the mud extractors at Liaoning Ceramics Factory No. 2 needed a batch of tie rods (tie rods are made of copper, and buying tie rods requires buying copper bars). The iron workshop of a certain workshop submitted a demand plan, which stated: The required specifications for copper bars were 6-15 mm, and the required amount was 500 *jin* (250 kg). When this plan was submitted to the Power Section for review, the Power Section changed the 6-15 mm specification to "no specification" and the 500 *jin* to 500 kilograms. Then it was sent to the Supply and Marketing Section. In order to make this work more "detailed," the Supply and Marketing Section specially sent someone to the workshop to inquire about the copper bar specifications and filled in the specifications according to the workshop's opinion. However, they had a "loosely estimated" plan for the purchase quantity. They believed that this kind of material was always difficult to allocate, so they should buy more at once to avoid trouble next time. Therefore, they doubled the 500 kilograms to 1,000 kilograms. At the end of February, a large batch of copper bars arrived at the factory. The specifications? All were 6 mm. Originally, the specifications of copper bars for manufacturing tie rods were very complex. Now that there is only one specification, it is of little use. In this way, 5,331 yuan of state funds were tied up.

    This factory has more than just this one instance of tying up state funds. According to our understanding, there are currently 1,987 water tanks tied up. When formulating the 1954 production plan, there were already 6,010 water tanks in the warehouse. However, Zhang Haitao, the head of the Supply and Marketing Section, "seemed" to remember that water tanks were out of stock in the third quarter of 1953. Therefore, it was decided to produce 15,000 water tanks in 1954. In the first quarter of 1954, the sales of water tanks were not good, and the factory's capital turnover was a bit tight. Some people suggested stopping production. However, Zhang Haitao did not listen to this suggestion until he was forced to stop production in July because the water tanks could not be sold. Due to the tying up of funds and the sluggish sales of products, the factory spent an extra 6,268 yuan in bank loan interest alone.

    When the state concentrates its main efforts on developing heavy industry, funds are so precious to our country! The irresponsible attitude of Liaoning Ceramics Factory No. 2 towards the treatment and use of state funds should be quickly corrected.

### 辽宁陶瓷二厂积压大量资金

　　辽宁陶瓷二厂积压大量资金编辑同志：
    一九五五年二月间，辽宁省陶瓷二厂的抽泥机上需要添置一批拉杆（拉杆是铜制的，添置拉杆就得买铜棒）。某车间铁工部提出了一个需用计划；计划写着：需用铜棒的规格是六——一五公厘，需用量是五百市斤。当这个计划送到动力科审核的时候，动力科却把需用六——一五公厘的规格变为没有规格，把五百市斤改为五百公斤。然后就送到供销科去了。供销科为了使这件工作更“细致”一些，特地派人到需用车间打听铜棒规格，并且按照车间的意见把规格填上。可是他们对采购数量却作了
  “宽打窄用”的打算，他们认为这种物资一向是不好调拨的，既然买一次就多买点，省得下次麻烦。于是把五百公斤加上一倍变成一千公斤。二月末，大批铜棒到厂，规格呢？完全是六公厘。本来，制造拉杆的铜棒规格很复杂，现在只有一种规格，当然用处不大。这样，积压了国家资金五千三百三十一元。
    这个厂积压国家资金的事情不只这一件，据我们了解目前积压的水箱就有一千九百八十七个。当编制一九五四年生产计划的时候，仓库内已经积压了六千零一十个水箱，然而供销科长张海涛的思想上“好像”记得一九五三年的第三季度里水箱是脱销的。于是，就确定一九五四年生产水箱一万五千个。一九五四年第一季度，水箱的销售状况不好，厂里的资金有些周转不灵了，有人提出了停止生产的建议。但是张海涛却不听取这个意见，直到确实销不出去了，才在七月份被逼停止生产。由于资金的积压和产品滞销，光付给银行信贷利息就多花费了六千二百六十八元。
    当国家集中主要力量发展重工业的时候，资金对我们国家来说是多么珍贵！辽宁省陶瓷二厂这种对待和运用国家资金不负责任的工作态度，应当迅速纠正。
