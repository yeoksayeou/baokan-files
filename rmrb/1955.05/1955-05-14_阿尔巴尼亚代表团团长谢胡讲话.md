Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 13th: The head of the Albanian People's Republic delegation, Shehu, spoke at the Warsaw conference on the 12th.

	Shehu said that, in light of the new dangerous situation in Europe formed after the ratification of the Paris Agreements, the government of the Albanian People's Republic is prepared, together with the governments of the countries participating in the conference, to take all necessary measures to guarantee the security of these countries, in order to guard against any possible aggression. The government and people of the Albanian People's Republic are deeply convinced that concluding a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance and organizing a joint command of the armed forces of our countries will further strengthen the unbreakable friendship and steel-like solidarity of these countries.

	Shehu said that, for the Albanian People's Republic, this treaty has special significance. For centuries, enemies have caused the Albanian people to suffer poverty and enslavement, and have created all sorts of conspiracies against them. Our people have not forgotten, and will never forget, all of this. Precisely because of this, they are filled with determination to fight to the end, and not let the terrible history repeat itself. The Albanian people believe that the Soviet Union, which liberated the Albanian people from enslavement and gave them freedom and life, is their first and true friend. Now, our people feel that they are strong, because our people have such loyal and strong friends as the countries of the invincible democratic camp. Albania is now a free and sovereign country, it is establishing the foundations of socialism, and has established relations on the principle of equality with the great Soviet Union, the great People's China, and all fraternal countries in the socialist camp.

	Shehu then said that the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance completely conforms to the vital interests of our country and our people. This treaty is based on Lenin's principles of equality between large and small countries, mutual respect for national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. This treaty is a clear manifestation of the new type of international relations, socialist relations, that have been established between the countries of our camp.

	Shehu concluded by saying that the Albanian People's Republic will in the future fight shoulder to shoulder with other peace-loving countries, and will make its own contribution to the cause of defending peace and international security. Our government and our people will forever and constantly safeguard and consolidate the friendship and steel-like solidarity of the great peace and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, raise vigilance against the enemy, and strengthen the national defense. Entrusted by the government and people of the Albanian People's Republic, our delegation makes a solemn guarantee to everyone: we will faithfully fulfill all the obligations included in the resolutions of this conference. The Albanian People's Republic will stand like a solid rock on the Adriatic coast, striving to defend peace, and defend the interests of our motherland and our socialist camp.

　　阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长谢胡讲话
    新华社华沙十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国代表团团长谢胡，十二日在华沙会议上讲了话。
    谢胡说，鉴于巴黎协定批准后欧洲所形成的新的危险局势，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府准备同参加会议的各国政府一道，采取一切必要的措施来保障这些国家的安全，以防备任何可能的侵略。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和人民深信，缔结友好、合作和互助条约和组织我们这些国家武装部队的联合司令部，将更加加强我们这些国家的牢不可破的友谊和钢铁般的团结。
    谢胡说，对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国说来，这个条约具有特别的意义。多少世纪来，敌人曾使阿尔巴尼亚人民遭受贫困和奴役，对他们制造各种各样的阴谋。我国人民没有忘记，而且永远不会忘记这一切的。正因为如此，他们充满决心斗争到底，不让可怕的历史重演。阿尔巴尼亚人民认为，从奴役下解放阿尔巴尼亚人民、并给他们以自由和生活的苏联，是自己第一个和真正的朋友。现在，我国人民感到自己是强有力的，因为我国人民有着不可战胜的民主阵营各国这样忠实而强有力的朋友。阿尔巴尼亚现在是自由的和主权的国家，它正在创立社会主义的基础，同伟大的苏联、伟大的人民中国和社会主义阵营所有兄弟国家在平等的原则上建立了关系。
    谢胡接着说，友好、合作和互助条约完全符合我们国家和我国人民的切身利益，这个条约是以列宁关于大小国家之间平等、互相尊重民族独立和主权，不干涉内政的原则为基础的；这个条约是我们阵营中各国之间所建立的新型国际关系，社会主义关系的明显的表现。
    谢胡最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国今后将同其他爱好和平的国家肩并肩地一起斗争，并对保卫和平和国际安全的事业作出自己的贡献。我国政府和我国人民将永远不断地维护和巩固以苏联为首的伟大的和平和社会主义阵营的友谊和钢铁般的团结，提高对敌人的警惕，巩固本国的国防。我们代表团受阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和人民的委托，向大家作出庄严的保证：我们将忠实履行这次会议的决议所包括的全部义务。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国将如同坚实的岩石一样屹立在亚得里亚海岸上，努力保卫和平，保卫我们祖国和我们社会主义阵营的利益。
