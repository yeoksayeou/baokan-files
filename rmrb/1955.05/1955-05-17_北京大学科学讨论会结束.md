The Peking University 1954-1955 academic year science discussion meeting concluded on the 15th. The discussion meeting held a total of four plenary sessions and thirty-six group sessions. In each group session, in addition to reporting on papers, discussions were also held, and different opinions were put forward on the reports. The debates were very lively in some group sessions, with speakers including not only teachers from the university but also guests from outside the university. Many papers aroused great interest among the listeners.

　　Some of the papers reported at the discussion meeting were theoretical, such as Jian Bozan's "The Historical Background of Dream of the Red Chamber," Wang Li's "On the Question of Whether There Are Parts of Speech in Chinese," and Fu Ying's "On the Adsorption of Solutions"; some were research papers concerning practical problems in production and construction or closely related to practical problems, such as Gao Xiaoxia and Han Wan's "Determination of Trace Amounts of Zinc in Nickel Electrolysis by Amperometric Titration"; Fan Ming's "Preliminary Research on Several Issues Concerning Criminal Liability Accidents in Factories and Mines"; and the report by the Human and Animal Physiology Teaching and Research Section of the Biology Department and Liu Ciyuan and Jin Jiarui, "Report on Vascular Reflexes to Skin Temperature Stimuli in Healthy People and Patients with Hypertension." There were also academic and ideological critical papers, such as Jin Yuelin, Wang Zisong, etc.'s "Criticism of Hu Shih's Pragmatist Philosophy"; and Tian Yuqing's "Eliminating the Pernicious Influence of Hu Shih's Thought in Historical Textual Research." In addition, there were also evaluative papers and experience summary papers.

　　Soviet experts at Peking University also made several important paper reports, such as expert Novodranov's "How to Organize Scientific Research Work in Universities" and expert Sapozhnikov's "The Marxist Dialectical Method is a Tool for Scientific Research," etc.

　　A notable feature of this scientific discussion meeting was that it closely integrated scientific research work with the struggle against bourgeois idealist thought. At the same time, many young lecturers, teaching assistants, and graduate students reported on their papers.

　　Through this scientific discussion meeting, many teachers and graduate students at Peking University have paid more attention to and become more interested in scientific research, and the atmosphere of free criticism and free discussion on scientific and academic issues has increased compared to before. Because many young lecturers, teaching assistants, and students reported on their papers at the discussion meeting, the aspirations and confidence of young comrades in carrying out scientific research were greatly encouraged. Some guests from outside the university who participated in the scientific discussion meeting also believed that the atmosphere of scientific debate in some of the group sessions at Peking University should be promoted, and that the practice of cooperation between young teachers and senior teachers can give play to collective wisdom and also cultivate new forces.

　　北京大学科学讨论会结束
    北京大学一九五四—一九五五学年科学讨论会，在十五日闭幕。讨论会共举行了四次全会和三十六次分组会。在各个分组会上，除进行论文报告外，并且展开了讨论，对报告提出不同的意见。有的分组会上争辩很热烈，发言的不仅有本校教师，还有校外来宾。许多论文，使听者发生了很大的兴趣。
    在讨论会上报告的论文有的是理论性的，如翦伯赞的“红楼梦的时代背景”，王力的“关于汉语有无词类问题”，傅鹰的“关于溶液的吸附”的论文；有的是关于生产建设实际中的问题或者是同实际问题有密切联系的研究性的论文，如高小霞和悍琬的“电流滴定法测定镍电解过程中微量的锌”；范明的“关于工厂矿山责任事故犯罪的几个问题的初步研究”；生物系人体及动物生理学教研室和刘次元、靳嘉瑞的“关于健康的人和高血压患者对皮肤温度刺激的血管反射的报告”。也有学术思想批判性的论文，如金岳霖、汪子嵩等的“批判胡适实用主义哲学”；田余庆的“清除胡适思想在历史考据中的恶劣影响”。此外，还有评述性的论文及经验总结性的论文。
    在北大的苏联专家也作了几篇重要的论文报告，如诺沃德拉诺夫专家的“在高等学校中如何组织科学研究工作”，萨坡什尼柯夫专家的“马克思主义的辩证方法是科学研究的工具”等。
    这次科学讨论会的一个显著特点是：把科学研究工作和反对资产阶级唯心主义思想的斗争紧密地结合起来了。同时，还有许多青年讲师、助教、研究生报告了自己的论文。
    通过这一次科学讨论会，北京大学许多教师和研究生对科学研究更加重视和感到兴趣了，科学和学术问题上的自由批评和自由讨论的空气比以前增加了。由于许多青年讲师、助教和学生在讨论会上报告了自己的论文，大大鼓舞了青年同志们进行科学研究的志趣和信心。一些参加科学讨论会的校外来宾也认为：北大某些分组会上科学论争的气氛是应该发扬的，青年教师和老教师合作的作法可以发挥集体智慧，同时也培养了新生力量。
