　　Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is trial planting more than 122,000 fruit tree saplings of various kinds this year, including apple, pear, and peach trees. Among them are 20,000 apple and pear saplings purchased from Liaoning Province, 2,300 peach and plum saplings purchased from Zhangjiakou Prefecture, Hebei, and 100,000 apple saplings donated by Liaoning Province. More than 30,000 fruit trees have now been distributed to fruit tree gardens, state-owned farms, and agricultural cooperatives with a foundation in Sarlach County, Tumote Banner and other places for cultivation experiments. The remaining 90,000 fruit tree saplings will first be concentrated in the suburbs of Hohhot for two years of temporary planting, and then be distributed to agricultural producers' cooperatives in a planned way for cultivation. Currently, various places are digging pits and planting trees. In the past, the vast majority of the fruit consumed by the people of Inner Mongolia had to be transported from other places, and the quantity was limited to a certain extent. In order to meet the needs of the people, relevant departments last year trial-planted more than 1,300 Northeast apple tree saplings on alkaline wasteland in the suburbs of Hohhot. After one year of cultivation experiments, the survival rate of the saplings reached about 70 percent. (Tang Yongzhong)

　  内蒙古试种果树十二万株
    内蒙古自治区今年试植苹果、梨、桃等各种果树苗十二万二千多株。其中有购自辽宁省的二万株苹果、梨树苗，购自河北张家口专区的二千三百株桃、李等树苗，还有辽宁省赠送的十万株苹果树苗。现已有三万多株果树分配给萨拉齐县、土默特旗等地的果树园、国营农场和有基础的农业社作栽培试验，其余的九万多株果树苗将首先集中在呼和浩特市郊区假植二年，然后再有计划地分配给各地农业生产合作社栽培。目前，各地正在挖坑、植树。过去内蒙古人民吃的水果绝大部分都要从外地运进，数量受到一定的限制。为了满足人民的需要，有关部门去年就在呼和浩特市郊碱荒地上试种了一千三百多株东北苹果树苗，经过一年的栽培试验，树苗的成活率达到百分之七十左右。（唐永忠）
