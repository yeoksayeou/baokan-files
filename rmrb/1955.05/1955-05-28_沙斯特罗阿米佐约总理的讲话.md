Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen:

	Please allow me to first express my profound gratitude to you, Mr. Prime Minister, for the sincere welcome you just extended to me with such beautiful and warm words.

	Sir, it is an unforgettable experience to be your guest and the guest of the Chinese people. The hospitality of the Chinese people has always been renowned throughout their long and enchanting history.

	I have been looking forward to this return visit with great pleasure, but I must admit that the warmth of the Chinese people's welcome to me, and the sincere atmosphere and friendly feelings I have felt since I set foot on Chinese soil, have far exceeded all my expectations.

	As the Prime Minister of Indonesia, it is also an unforgettable experience, and perhaps I can call it a major event, to come to your country to meet face-to-face with New China and further strengthen the friendly and good-neighborly ties that have existed between our two countries since ancient times—as you just so beautifully mentioned.

	Although this is my first visit to our largest neighbor, we in Indonesia know China and your way of life very well, because we have no fewer than two million overseas Chinese and citizens of Chinese descent among us. They are an important part of our country's diverse population, and they have brought with them from their ancient homeland an outstanding talent for trade, as well as a large part of your country's famous culture.

	It is a pleasant coincidence that during the Bandung Asian-African Conference, our two governments were able to agree on a solution that was satisfactory to both sides, so that the issue of the nationality of the overseas Chinese in Indonesia could be resolved by granting them the right to choose their nationality.

	I dare say that this treaty is of the utmost importance, because no fewer than twelve million overseas Chinese live in various Asian countries. Therefore, we may have taken a new step in peacefully resolving the complex issue of dual nationality that concerns millions of people throughout Asia by reaching a satisfactory and far-reaching solution.

	Sir, you just mentioned the Asian-African Conference, and I completely agree that this conference, in which you played such an important and conciliatory role, is a unique event in the history of mankind, especially in the history of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

	The twenty-nine countries that gathered there have different lifestyles, and their political, economic, and social systems are often very different. However, we were able to prove to the world—in an unprecedented way and on an unprecedented scale—that no matter how difficult and controversial the problems may be, they can be solved with tolerance, a willingness to understand, goodwill, and common sense.

	In the course of our detailed discussions, we had consensus and disagreements, but in the end there were neither victors nor losers. This is a truth. When it comes to truly important issues that are of great importance to all mankind—the primary issue being true peace—victory belongs to tolerance, wisdom, and common sense.

	In the past year, you, sir, have made a valuable contribution to world peace by formulating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence together with the Prime Ministers of India and Burma. These principles are of great significance, and although they have met with much criticism and suspicion, I am convinced that they are well conducive to the cause of peace.

	These five principles are derived from the ten principles stipulated in the final part of the Joint Communiqué of the Bandung Conference—or it can be said that the latter is a further development of the former.

	Our recently formulated ten principles express the common beliefs and firm views of the two major continents of Asia and Africa. They are not just a declaration, they must be seen as the rules of life for the peoples of Asia and Africa, and the rules on which their relations with each other and with other regions of the world will be based in the future.

	I am convinced that we have therefore provided a good service to the benefit of mankind. Let us pray and hope that the rest of the world will cherish the Bandung Declaration as we do. In that case, the pain of fear and suspicion may eventually disappear and give way to a new era of lasting peace and good neighborliness.

	I have said that I am in favor of personal contact, sir, and I am sure you share this view. One of the most gratifying achievements of the Bandung Conference was the increased personal friendship and respect among Asian and African leaders and politicians.

	Therefore, it was fortunate that you were able to stay with us in Indonesia for a few more days after the end of the Asian-African Conference. This gave us the opportunity to place the relations between our two countries within the broader scope of the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference.

	Sir, we are now together again to discuss issues of common concern. I believe that our talks will be just as friendly and fruitful as they were not long ago.

	I have already learned of your great abilities as a statesman and diplomat, and your grace as a guest. In addition to this, I now have the honor to mention your qualities as a perfect host.

	I would like to propose a toast to Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of China, to you, Mr. Prime Minister, and to the government of your country. I would like to express my deep gratitude.

### 沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理的讲话

　　沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理的讲话阁下，各位女士和先生：
    请允许我首先向您，总理先生，对您刚才用这样优美和热烈的言词向我表示的诚挚的欢迎，表示非常的感谢。
    先生，能够做您的客人和中国人民的客人是一种令人难忘的经历。中国人民的殷勤好客在他们悠久和令人神往的历史上是素来闻名的。
    我一直抱着非常愉快的心情期望这次酬答访问，但是我必须承认，中国人民对我的欢迎的热烈程度，以及自从我一踏上中国土地后所感到的诚挚的气氛和友好的感情是远远出乎我的一切意料的。
    作为印度尼西亚的总理到贵国来同新中国面对面会晤，进一步加强我们两国自从远古以来——像您刚才这样动听地所说到的一样——所一直存在着的友好和善邻的联系，也是一种令人难忘的经历，我也许可以称它为一件大事。
    虽然我是第一次访问我们最大的一个邻邦，但是我们在印度尼西亚的人很知道中国和你们的生活方式，因为我们中间有不下二百万的华侨和中国血统的公民。他们是我国多种多样的居民的一个重要的构成部分，他们从他们古老的故乡带来了一种杰出的贸易才能，此外还有很大一部分贵国著名文化。
    在万隆亚非会议期间，我们两国政府能够商定一个对双方来说都是令人满意的解决办法，使得印度尼西亚华侨的国籍问题能够由于给予他们选择国籍的权利而获得解决，这是一个令人愉快的巧合。
    我敢说，这个条约是具有最大的重要性的，因为有不下一千二百万的华侨居住在亚洲各国。因此，我们可能由于达成了一个令人满意的和影响深远的解决办法，而在和平解决为整个亚洲千百万人民所关心的错综复杂的双重国籍问题方面，迈进了新的一步。
    先生，您刚才提到亚非会议，我完全同意，这个您在其中起了这样一种重要和和解的作用的会议，在人类的历史上，特别是在亚非各国人民的历史上，是一件独一无二的事。
    在那里聚首一堂的二十九个国家生活方式各不相同，政治、经济、社会制度也往往是很不一样的。但是，我们能够向世界证明——通过一种前所未有的方式和规模证明——问题不论多么困难和引起争论，都是可以用容忍、愿意谅解的精神，用善意和常识来解决的。
    在我们详尽的讨论过程中，我们有一致的意见，也有不同的意见，但是到头来既没有胜利者，也没有失败者。这是一个真理。在牵涉到真正的重大问题，对全人类具有极大重要意义的问题——其中首要问题是真正的和平——的时候，胜利是属于容忍、智慧和常识的。
    在过去一年中，您，先生，对世界和平作了宝贵的贡献，先后同印度总理和缅甸总理一起制定了和平共处的五项原则。这些原则是具有重大意义的，虽然它们遇到很多批评和猜疑，我确信它们是很好地有助于和平事业的。
    这五项原则衍生了万隆会议联合公报的最后部分规定的十项原则——或者可以说后者是前者的进一步发展。
    最近制定的我们的十项原则表达了亚非两大洲的一致信念和坚定的看法。它们不只是一项宣言，必须把它们看成是亚非人民所生活的规章，今后它们彼此的关系和同世界上其他地区的关系将要依据的规章。
    我确信我们因此为人类利益提供了很好的服务。让我们祷告和希望世界上其余地区的人将像我们一样珍视万隆宣言。那样一来，恐惧和猜疑的痛苦到头来也许会消失，而让位于一个持久的和平和善邻的新时代。
    我已说过，我是主张亲身接触的，先生，我确信您也抱有这种看法。万隆会议的最令人高兴的成就之一是亚非领袖们和政治家们之间个人友谊和尊敬有了增长。
    因此，您在亚非会议结束后能在印度尼西亚同我们一起再呆一些日子，是幸运的。这使我们有机会把我们两国之间的关系放在更广泛的万隆会议十项原则的范围以内。
    先生，我们现在又在一起讨论共同关心的问题了。我相信我们的会谈将同样是友好而有成果的，像不久前那次一样。
    我已经了解您作为一位政治家兼外交家具有的伟大能力和作为一位嘉宾具有的风度。除此之外，我现在还有幸可以一提您作为一个完美的主人的品质。
    我愿意建议为中国的伟大领袖毛泽东主席，为您，总理先生，以及贵国政府干杯。我谨表示深深的谢意。
