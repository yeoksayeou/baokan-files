　　Completing New Product Trial Production Tasks Ahead of Schedule
　　Ye Cailin, Hunan Provincial Industrial Labor Model and Director of the Forging Workshop of Changsha Machine Tool Factory

　　At the very beginning of April, our factory launched a heated labor competition to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day.

　　The youth production team of the general assembly section of the assembly workshop had broken the quota for the most difficult process three times in a row in the first quarter of this year, becoming an advanced banner among the young workers in the factory. On April 2nd, after discussing the monthly plan, they proposed to overfulfill the national plan for April as a competition condition to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day, and challenged the youth team of the third section of the machine workshop. Then, the youth teams in all the workshops in the factory responded enthusiastically. The veteran workers also happily set competition conditions. Thus, a vigorous competition upsurge was set off from the teams to the sections, from the sections to the workshops, and from the workshops to the departments.

　　Our slogan is: "Improve technology, improve product quality, complete new product trial production tasks ahead of schedule, and support key construction." A Soviet-style steel wire cutting machine that the assembly workshop plans to trial produce successfully in April is to support the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. A Soviet-style hydraulic broaching machine that the machine workshop plans to trial produce in April is also an order from several newly built and expanded heavy machinery factories. A Soviet-style hydraulic slotting machine that the wooden mold section of the foundry workshop plans to trial produce in April is an order from several precision machine tool manufacturing plants that will be put into production in the coming years. Each workshop has the task of trial production of new products. We know that every new product supports key construction. Completing the task of trial production of new products is of great significance to accelerating the country's socialist construction. Therefore, we all focused on the task of trial production of new products, learned advanced operating methods, and set practical competition conditions. All departments are also working intensively on the product design and process specifications for several other new products to be trial produced in the second quarter. From the beginning of April, the workshops have been continuously reporting production successes. For example, the forging workshop, which has overfulfilled the national plan for twenty-seven consecutive months, completed all twenty days of tasks seven days ahead of schedule.

　　We launched the labor competition to welcome "May Day" on the basis of overfulfilling the plan in the first quarter. Therefore, our competition is not only enthusiastic and energetic, but also has a solid foundation and sufficient confidence.

　　In the fourth quarter of 1954, our factory comprehensively overfulfilled the national plan and won the Changsha City mobile competition red flag. In the first quarter of this year, we again comprehensively overfulfilled the national plan. A Soviet-style special slotting machine that we successfully trial produced in the first quarter has been technically appraised and fully meets Soviet design standards. The circular saws, bow saws, and thread rolling machines that we produce in batches have been supplied in large quantities to key projects in Anshan, Daye, Benxi, Harbin, Taiyuan, Shanghai, and Yumen. When we go to work and get off work every day, and see the products we have made with our own hands "shipped to other places" in the finished product storage yard and on the loading and unloading platforms, we are all full of excitement and joy.

　　In the first quarter of this year, 33 advanced producers emerged throughout the factory. The 50 advanced producers in the fourth quarter of 1954 still maintained the glorious title of advanced producers. Thirteen outstanding cadres and workers joined the Communist Party of China. Comrade Xia Yunqiu, a model planer, could only process two 872-type bow saw machine bases at a time on a heavy gantry planer in the past, but now he has increased it to seven, increasing production efficiency by three and a half times. Model turner Peng Mutang and others improved the operating method four times when manufacturing the gate hoist rope wheels to support the Dongting Lake embankment project, breaking the quota and catching up with the progress. Technician Tang Zhidao of the construction section went deep into the workshop, humbly studied with veteran workers, and designed a high-efficiency, low-cost, and high-quality mold fixture. These advanced figures and advanced deeds have driven the factory's employees forward and encouraged every employee's enthusiasm for building socialism.

　　In April, we did a lot of work to improve quality. The department personnel used and mastered the characteristics of small-batch production, shortening the trial production cycle. All departments strengthened the technical preparation work before production, overcame confusion, and established normal working order. When implementing and discussing process specifications, we held a quality exhibition. We felt very sad when we saw the opinions of users on the poor quality of our products. We proposed some improvement measures to address the quality issues. The comrades in the forging workshop proposed a total of twenty improvement suggestions when discussing the process specifications for the 872-type bow saw. Everyone firmly stated that they must take another step forward on the basis of continuously overfulfilling the plan for twenty-seven months. Xia Yunqiu, who mastered the heavy gantry planer, exceeded the load by more than 130 hours, but he was full of confidence that he must implement advanced working methods such as multi-tool cutting on the basis of ensuring quality, and complete the monthly task as scheduled. In the guarantee conditions of the labor competition, we paid special attention to saving materials. All workshops held regular financial cost analysis meetings. The forging workshop saved 1,325 kilograms of steel in the first half of April. Veteran worker Li Zhenlin and master Li Maocai both used waste materials to save a lot of raw materials, and enthusiastically responded to the call to save metal materials.

　　提前完成新产品试制任务
　　长沙机床厂锻工场主任湖南省工业劳动模范　叶财林
    还是四月份刚刚开始的时候，我们厂里迎接“五一”国际劳动节的劳动竞赛便热烈地展开了。
    装配工场总装工段青年生产班在今年第一季度曾连续三次突破最难的一道工序的定额，成为全厂青年工人中一面先进的旗帜。四月二日，他们在讨论月计划后，便提出超额完成四月份国家计划作为迎接“五一”国际劳动节的竞赛条件，向机器工场第三工段青年班挑战。接着全厂各个车间的青年班都纷纷应战。老师傅们也兴高采烈地订了竞赛条件。于是，由班组到工段，由工段到车间，由车间到科室，掀起了轰轰烈烈的竞赛热潮。
    我们的口号是：“提高技术，提高产品质量，提前完成新产品试制任务，支援重点建设”。装配工场四月份计划试制成功的一种苏式切钢丝机，就是支援第一汽车制造厂的。机器工场四月份试制的一种苏式液压拉床也是几个新建和扩建的重型机器厂的订货。型铸工场木模工段四月份试制的一种苏式压液插床，是明、后年即将投入生产的几个精密工作母机制造厂的订货。各个车间都有新产品试制的任务。我们知道，每一种新产品都是支援重点建设的。完成新产品试制的任务对加速国家的社会主义建设有重要意义。因此，我们都围绕着新产品试制任务，学习先进操作方法，订出切实的竞赛条件。各个科室也都在紧张地进行第二季度试制的另外几种新产品的产品设计工作，编制工艺规程。从四月初起，各个车间就不断地传出生产捷报。例如连续二十七个月完成国家计划的锻工场，提前七天全部完成了二十天的任务。
    我们是在第一季度超额完成计划的基础上展开迎接“五一”的劳动竞赛的。因此，我们的竞赛不仅热情高，劲头大，而且基础稳，信心足。
    一九五四年第四季度我们厂里全面超额完成了国家计划，获得了长沙市流动竞赛红旗。今年第一季度，我们又全面超额完成了国家计划。第一季度我们试制成功的一种苏式专用插床，经过技术鉴定，完全合乎苏联设计标准。我们成批生产的元盘锯、弓锯床和滚丝机，大量供应了鞍山、大冶、本溪、哈尔滨、太原、上海和玉门等地的重点工程单位的需要。当我们每天上班下班，在成品堆放场和装卸月台上，看到自己亲手制造的产品“运往外地”的时候，我们都充满着兴奋和愉快。
    今年第一季度，全厂涌现了三十三个先进生产者。一九五四年第四季度的五十个先进生产者，仍然保持了先进生产者的光荣称号。有十三个优秀的干部和工人加入了中国共产党。模范刨工夏运球同志在重型龙门刨床上，过去一次只能加工两个八七二型弓锯床机座，现在增加到七个，提高生产效率三倍半。模范车工彭慕汤等在制造支援洞庭湖堤垸工程的闸门启闭机绳轮时，四次改进操作方法，突破了定额，赶上了进度。施工科技术员唐植道深入工场，虚心同老师傅研究，设计了一种效率高、花钱少和质量好的模卡具。这些先进人物和先进事迹，带动着全厂职工前进，也鼓舞着每一个职工建设社会主义的热情。
    四月份，我们在提高质量方面，做了不少工作。科室人员运用和掌握了单位小批生产的特点，缩短了试制周期。各部门加强了生产前的技术准备工作，克服了混乱现象，建立了正常的工作秩序。在贯彻和讨论工艺规程的时候，我们举办了一次质量展览会。我们看到用户对我们产品质量不好提出的意见，都感到十分的难过。我们针对质量问题，提出了一些改进的办法。锻工车间的同志在讨论八七二型弓锯床的工艺规程时，一共提出了二十条改进意见。大家坚决表示，一定要在连续二十七个月超额完成计划的基础上，再前进一步。夏运球掌握的那部重型龙门刨床，超过负荷一百三十多小时，但他充满信心，一定要在保证质量的基础上，实行多刀切削等先进工作方法，如期完成全月任务。在劳动竞赛的保证条件中，我们特别注意节约材料。各车间召开了定期的财务成本分析会议。锻工车间在四月份上半月，已节约钢材一千三百二十五公斤。李镇林老师傅和李茂才师傅都利用废料，节约了很多原材料，热烈地响应了节约金属材料的号召。
